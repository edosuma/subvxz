02:19.491 --> 02:20.533
My father...

02:21.785 --> 02:23.953
During his last days,
demanded

02:24.287 --> 02:27.290
that some philosophy books
be placed on the locker beside his bed.

02:28.541 --> 02:30.752
My father's taught philosophy
as a profession

02:31.086 --> 02:32.629
and read philosophy for pleasure

02:33.213 --> 02:35.090
and I wrote only novels.

02:35.674 --> 02:39.427
He had a right to think that I inhabited
a space filled with banality,

02:39.886 --> 02:43.473
filled with gross inventions,
foolish plot lines.

02:46.226 --> 02:48.395
The next day I went
to my father’s old apartment

02:48.687 --> 02:50.980
and rummaged through the books
in his study.

02:51.523 --> 02:54.359
I found his old copy
of the Critique of Pure Reason

02:54.693 --> 02:56.319
with many notes in the margin

02:56.778 --> 03:00.782
and his thumb-nailed edition
of Plato’s Symposium”..

03:01.866 --> 03:04.661
I found a fat volume of Hegel

03:05.036 --> 03:09.541
and an untouched edition
of Derek Parfit’s On What Matters”..

03:11.042 --> 03:14.587
Put them in a pile on the locker
while he was sleeping.

03:15.797 --> 03:17.966
Once when my father opened his eyes.

03:18.675 --> 03:21.720
I showed him the Parfit
which was at the top of the pile

03:22.470 --> 03:25.974
and I pronounced the title in
the best English accent I could manage.

03:26.349 --> 03:28.101
On What Matters”..

03:29.686 --> 03:32.188
It would be nice to say that he smiled

03:32.897 --> 03:34.232
but he did not smile.

03:34.566 --> 03:35.859
Instead he spoke:

03:37.026 --> 03:38.236
Heinrich

03:38.862 --> 03:41.823
Heinrich there are only two things
that matter” he said

03:43.074 --> 03:45.618
there is the thing you did
that you regret

03:45.994 --> 03:48.121
the thing that cannot be undone

03:48.872 --> 03:51.166
and then there is the thing
that you did not do

03:51.708 --> 03:52.959
that you should have done

03:53.710 --> 03:55.253
that you regret too

03:56.087 --> 03:57.505
but it’s too late now.

03:59.382 --> 04:02.886
It’s easy to say that these things
do not matter because they’re over

04:03.261 --> 04:04.471
but they do.

04:04.888 --> 04:06.890
They are in fact what matters.

04:07.557 --> 04:10.310
The things in between
do not matter at all.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.023
Is that a quote from a book”
I asked him.

04:15.648 --> 04:19.402
Suddenly his voice became almost gentle

04:20.403 --> 04:23.907
his tone filled with regret as he said.

04:24.616 --> 04:25.784
No”

04:26.117 --> 04:27.994
and then repeated the word.

04:28.620 --> 04:29.788
No”

04:30.205 --> 04:31.581
on a sigh.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.376
It would be nice to say that

04:36.336 --> 04:40.924
he then turned over died and that No”
was his last word but it wasn't.

04:41.299 --> 04:43.635
He lived for 6 or 7 weeks more.

04:48.014 --> 04:49.432
Is that thunder.

05:08.243 --> 05:12.580
In those last weeks my father’s words
about what matters hit home.

05:13.540 --> 05:17.585
I almost asked the doctor
if he too indeed if all of us

05:18.795 --> 05:20.755
if the nurses and the other patients

05:21.339 --> 05:23.800
if the porters and the other visitors

05:24.509 --> 05:27.178
if the night cleaners
and the taxi drivers outside

05:27.595 --> 05:29.722
if we all had done
one thing in our lives

05:30.098 --> 05:31.558
that we knew was wrong

05:32.350 --> 05:35.353
and if we all had one thing
we did not do in our lives

05:35.687 --> 05:37.188
which we regretted.

05:38.022 --> 05:42.652
And if these two things became
the story of our lives

05:43.444 --> 05:46.948
the story of what matter what matters
more than anything else matter

05:47.532 --> 05:49.033
or ever will matter.

05:57.584 --> 05:59.460
When my father spoke about what matters

06:00.670 --> 06:02.171
an image came to me

06:02.714 --> 06:04.507
and remains with me.

06:05.174 --> 06:06.885
It’s an image of two women

06:08.136 --> 06:09.929
one whom I caused harm

06:10.763 --> 06:12.974
and the other whom I failed.

06:14.058 --> 06:16.185
Whom I should not have failed

06:16.728 --> 06:19.898
who I should be with now
if I’d been wiser then.

06:21.232 --> 06:23.359
Whom I wonder about still.

06:35.997 --> 06:39.375
Thank you so much Max for giving us
despite your jetlag

06:39.876 --> 06:42.337
- a taste of The Hunter and the Hunted.
- Thank you.

06:42.712 --> 06:45.381
There will be a longer reading
at the public library tomorrow.

06:45.715 --> 06:46.758
Congratulations.

06:47.091 --> 06:48.451
Our publicist has all the details.

06:49.427 --> 06:50.595
It was so great.

06:53.389 --> 06:54.634
So this is my friend Julia.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.725
- Hi Julia.
- Hello Max.

06:56.142 --> 06:59.437
- I really really enjoyed your reading.
- Thank you.

06:59.896 --> 07:01.230
So you’re Clara’s guy.

07:01.564 --> 07:04.567
You left her alone all winter
in New York and you weren’t worried.

07:06.152 --> 07:08.571
- We can’t wait.
- The performance was profound.

07:08.905 --> 07:11.282
Hm
- The performance was profound.

07:16.663 --> 07:17.997
Can we go home.

07:18.498 --> 07:19.749
Sure.

07:30.635 --> 07:32.595
I can’t believe it.

07:37.141 --> 07:38.184
Max

07:40.144 --> 07:41.270
Walter.

07:43.231 --> 07:45.441
Oh So nice to see you again.

07:46.818 --> 07:48.820
It said in the papers

07:49.153 --> 07:51.864
that you've come to
make a presentation.

07:52.365 --> 07:54.575
Yeah tomorrow at the public library.

07:55.994 --> 07:58.538
Your mom would be proud of you.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.417
Who is this charming creature.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.378
- This is my wife Clara. This is Walter.
- Nice to meet you.

08:06.295 --> 08:07.422
Nice to meet you.

08:10.883 --> 08:15.221
- Will you come to the reading.
- No no no... tomorrow I’m sorry...

08:15.555 --> 08:18.516
I've a friend holding a preview
and I promised to go.

08:20.435 --> 08:21.978
Would you care to come with me.

08:23.187 --> 08:25.356
No but I... I have the reading.

08:25.815 --> 08:27.692
Yes I know I know.

08:28.401 --> 08:29.652
I'm not deaf

08:30.028 --> 08:32.113
despite my years. So...

08:32.488 --> 08:34.115
Another book of yours.

08:34.532 --> 08:35.575
Yes a novel.

08:36.868 --> 08:37.994
Another fiction.

08:39.495 --> 08:40.830
Truth.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.752
It’s so good to see you
it’s been too long.

08:46.586 --> 08:48.963
I’m sure it will be a big success.

08:52.133 --> 08:55.303
Is this the first time you've been back
after so long.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.222
Yes it is
or I would have been in touch.

08:58.848 --> 09:03.144
I would love to arrange a dinner
for you and a few friends.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.398
- Thank you.
- You call me.

09:08.232 --> 09:09.358
I will.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.487
Goodnight.

09:15.448 --> 09:17.283
- You’II call me.
- I will.

09:17.909 --> 09:19.118
How do you know that guy.

09:19.452 --> 09:21.370
He’s an old friend.
He financed my studied.

09:21.704 --> 09:23.539
He financed a lot of other things too.

09:24.248 --> 09:26.250
He’s the one
who made the big donation to the Met.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.921
There was a dinner for him
and he didn’t turn up.

09:29.462 --> 09:31.672
Someone told me he collected
unbelievable things.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.258
He looks like the kind of guy
who collects dead bodies.

09:40.681 --> 09:41.980
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.309
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

09:45.269 --> 09:46.813
So this was Walter.

09:47.355 --> 09:50.566
I knew it the minute I saw him.
Every bit the way you described him.

09:51.484 --> 09:52.684
Was he in the room when I read.

09:52.902 --> 09:55.530
Not that I saw.
Maybe somewhere in the back.

09:56.155 --> 09:57.698
He gives me the creeps.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.368
He’s a very gifted man.

10:00.743 --> 10:02.411
It was strange seeing him.

10:05.998 --> 10:08.251
I’m so happy you’re finally here.

10:09.335 --> 10:10.795
Sometimes on the phone

10:11.129 --> 10:14.382
I just couldn’t say that all I wanted
was to get home to you.

10:15.758 --> 10:19.679
I missed you so much
I started to hate you.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.390
I was worried too.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.810
I panicked a few times.

10:26.853 --> 10:29.480
But I knew where you were
and that was the main thing.

10:34.652 --> 10:36.737
How do you know all those people.

10:37.113 --> 10:39.740
That’s part of my job:
Marketing advertising...

10:40.116 --> 10:41.659
it's all got to do with them.

10:42.076 --> 10:45.705
And even little interns from Germany
get to meet writers.

10:50.251 --> 10:51.544
You looked fantastic.

10:51.961 --> 10:53.504
- Did I.
- Yes you did.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.922
Yes.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.408
I love you. You know that.

13:16.605 --> 13:18.149
Two-fifty.

13:18.482 --> 13:20.443
Twice as much as last time.

13:20.776 --> 13:24.488
So we got you a phone
and I programmed some numbers in it

13:26.532 --> 13:27.658
as you'll see...

13:31.912 --> 13:33.914
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Hello.

13:34.415 --> 13:35.415
Hello.

13:37.126 --> 13:39.128
OK... so...

13:41.213 --> 13:45.343
A lot of demands for interviews...
After a short press release.

13:45.676 --> 13:47.094
Keep it to a minimum.

13:47.595 --> 13:49.472
You being here
will make a lot of a difference.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.810
I’II do my best.
Don’t give my number to anyone.

13:52.308 --> 13:54.977
What about personal calls
Friends and family.

13:55.394 --> 13:56.604
No I don’t have any.

13:57.355 --> 13:58.522
Well there’s Mr. Walter.

13:59.357 --> 14:00.608
Yeah. He’s the exception.

14:03.319 --> 14:05.613
Could you call him
and invite him to the reading.

14:06.197 --> 14:08.949
I know he won’t come
but ask him for Rebecca’s number.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.826
Rebecca.

14:11.243 --> 14:14.163
Yeah he’II know.
It’s an old friend I want to invite.

14:17.583 --> 14:18.709
Is Clara coming down.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
There she is.

14:21.337 --> 14:22.470
Good morning Lindsey.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.173
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:24.548 --> 14:26.884
How are you.
- Good How are you - Thank you.

14:39.563 --> 14:41.190
He loves your work.

14:41.524 --> 14:43.984
...after this message,
we'll be talking with

14:44.360 --> 14:46.237
the Scandinavian author Max Zorn.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.490
Mr. Zorn.

14:50.366 --> 14:51.909
How did you know.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.787
Well I was told to look for a gentleman

14:55.121 --> 14:58.124
with the distinction
of a European antique dealer.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.292
Right this way.

15:01.710 --> 15:04.255
Now might be a good moment
to call Walter.

15:08.134 --> 15:10.052
Mr. Zorn as an intellectual

15:10.386 --> 15:13.514
a poet a playwright
a novelist living in Berlin

15:13.889 --> 15:15.141
let me ask you

15:15.474 --> 15:17.643
do you believe that
Europe will collapse

15:18.018 --> 15:19.937
as soon as many commentators
are suggesting

15:20.396 --> 15:23.315
Europe is a is a culture
before it’s an economy

15:23.607 --> 15:27.111
and that’s something the Americans
have problems understanding.

15:27.695 --> 15:29.238
Maybe because it’s a complex culture.

15:29.947 --> 15:31.866
Our stories are anti-heroic.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.952
If we see someone in power
or a political leader we laugh

15:35.286 --> 15:37.371
because self-deprecation
is our first gear.

15:39.248 --> 15:42.209
Our stories are filled
with idiots and fools

15:43.127 --> 15:44.378
and chancers and losers.

15:44.712 --> 15:46.338
Pinocchios and Don Quixotes.

15:46.672 --> 15:50.092
The Emperor without clothes
or Hamlet or Don Juan...

15:50.593 --> 15:54.346
and that is... that is the bedrock
upon which our house is built.

15:54.889 --> 15:56.724
No matter what happens
in the short term

15:57.266 --> 15:59.185
Europe will keep its spirit.

16:00.352 --> 16:04.899
For years you were on the radical side
then you campaigned for the Chancellor

16:06.108 --> 16:09.320
and now you support the Greens
and want the borders open even more.

16:09.945 --> 16:11.363
What exactly is your position.

16:12.615 --> 16:13.782
Well I’m not a tree.

16:14.617 --> 16:15.617
Excuse me.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.747
A tree has roots it stands
in one place it has a position.

16:20.289 --> 16:21.332
I’m an animal.

16:21.665 --> 16:24.084
I’m wild I move I change positions
I’m flexible.

16:25.127 --> 16:26.170
OK...

16:26.629 --> 16:31.175
So what did he say - It was awkward.
He had me spell your name.

16:31.550 --> 16:32.593
That’s Walter.

16:32.927 --> 16:35.554
Then he confirmed he would not
be attending your event tonight

16:35.971 --> 16:37.556
and finally...

16:38.015 --> 16:40.684
he laughed out loud
when I asked for Rebecca’s number.

16:41.143 --> 16:43.771
Miss Epstein Esquire Attorney at law”
he said

16:44.271 --> 16:46.524
and asked why you didn’t call yourself.

16:46.857 --> 16:48.067
Mrs. Epstein.

16:51.195 --> 16:52.738
Miss Epstein please.

16:53.781 --> 16:55.449
For Mr. Max Zorn.

16:56.784 --> 16:57.993
He’s an author.

16:58.744 --> 17:00.579
She knows him. It’s personal.

17:01.789 --> 17:02.831
Thank you.

17:08.337 --> 17:09.880
Ah Miss Epstein hi.

17:10.214 --> 17:12.424
This is Mr. Zorn’s publicist

17:12.840 --> 17:15.844
and he’s in town for his last book
and he’s just wondering

17:16.220 --> 17:17.596
if he could see you.

17:19.265 --> 17:21.767
He’s right here in front of me
if you’d like to talk to him.

17:23.894 --> 17:26.771
Well he’s in town until
Tuesday night...

17:27.856 --> 17:29.733
Yes... I understand... Of course.

17:31.860 --> 17:33.904
What’s going on Why did you do that.

17:34.405 --> 17:35.948
She was about to say no wasn’t she.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.412
It’s better the battery went dead.
Do you have her address.

17:43.122 --> 17:44.290
It’s a law firm yeah.

17:44.832 --> 17:46.709
Great. Let’s go there.

17:47.668 --> 17:50.462
- It’s all the way downtown.
- Yes we’II take the subway.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.382
- To do what.
- Pay her a visit.

17:54.758 --> 17:56.051
Now.

17:56.385 --> 17:57.803
Well she’s there now isn’t she.

17:59.138 --> 18:01.515
Well you can’t do that.
You won’t get past security.

18:04.018 --> 18:05.060
Z.O.R.N.

18:05.394 --> 18:07.813
I cannot let you through
without a proper appointment.

18:08.147 --> 18:11.483
- I know her she’s an old friend.
- OK listen just let me handle it OK.

18:12.985 --> 18:15.654
Could I talk to her on the phone
please Thank you.

18:17.531 --> 18:20.784
Hi... No yeah... we were just trying
to phone about 15 minutes ago

18:21.118 --> 18:23.120
and you know the battery went dead...

18:23.537 --> 18:25.831
well you know
we were in the neighborhood so...

18:27.124 --> 18:29.335
OK. All right thank you...

18:35.716 --> 18:38.427
- She said she may come down.
- Fine.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.308
How did she sound.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.227
- Brisk.
- Brisk.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.271
Yeah she sounded pretty upset.

18:49.688 --> 18:51.398
She wanted me to know she went to Yale.

18:51.815 --> 18:54.360
- She said that.
- No she said almost nothing.

18:56.779 --> 18:58.155
She did go to Yale.

18:58.489 --> 19:01.325
On a Fulbright scholarship
right after the wall came down.

19:02.368 --> 19:04.662
Straight out of East Berlin
to Manhattan via Yale.

19:04.995 --> 19:06.664
There you have it in a nutshell.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.291
So she’s German.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.503
- Yeah but I met her in New York.
- And you never saw her again.

19:12.836 --> 19:14.838
No. But I looked for her.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.256
You looked for her.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.134
Yes but I didn’t even know
if she was still living in New York.

19:19.468 --> 19:22.638
How could I find her
her name having changed and everything.

19:23.722 --> 19:25.391
Then I saw Walter.

19:26.058 --> 19:28.060
He knew us when we were together.

19:30.396 --> 19:32.314
Being in the city

19:34.608 --> 19:37.695
every street corner reminds me of her.

19:38.404 --> 19:39.655
It’s important.

19:41.407 --> 19:44.201
We didn’t show up well in the end
neither one of us.

19:44.535 --> 19:45.911
So she’s the one from the book.

19:47.413 --> 19:50.040
No the book is a novel.

20:04.096 --> 20:05.431
Surprise surprise.

20:08.267 --> 20:09.435
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:13.272 --> 20:15.691
You look exactly as I imagined.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.576
- How did you find me.
- Walter gave me your number.

20:25.909 --> 20:28.454
Walter So you still see him.

20:28.787 --> 20:31.415
Last night I...
one of those coincidences.

20:32.124 --> 20:34.168
I haven’t seen him
for at least 10 years. How is he.

20:35.127 --> 20:37.796
You haven’t
How come he has your number.

20:38.130 --> 20:39.465
You know how he is.

20:43.177 --> 20:44.636
Mrs. Epstein.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.847
You’re married.

20:52.394 --> 20:54.855
It’s the perfect name for a lawyer
especially in New York.

20:57.232 --> 21:00.569
So you really didn’t change.
Still the same old racist.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.780
I... I... I was never racist.

21:03.739 --> 21:05.157
Let’s not argue.

21:08.452 --> 21:11.330
We wanted to invite you to the tonight
at the Public.

21:12.498 --> 21:13.874
You’II be on the guest list.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.877
Your old place Max.

21:18.837 --> 21:19.963
Will you come.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.966
Can we meet.

21:28.847 --> 21:30.599
Would be a mistake if we didn’t.

21:34.311 --> 21:35.854
We would regret it.

21:39.525 --> 21:40.734
I have to check my schedule.

21:41.527 --> 21:44.696
I’m working on a very difficult case
right now. I have to work late.

21:45.364 --> 21:47.825
If it were any other time...
this is all a bit sudden.

21:52.871 --> 21:54.039
Wait...

21:54.373 --> 21:56.291
did you have another copy of the book.

21:58.627 --> 21:59.670
Here...

22:01.004 --> 22:02.047
And...

22:02.756 --> 22:05.676
Yeah... This is my card.
And I wrote Mr. Zorn’s number on it.

22:25.487 --> 22:27.990
It’s her address.
Mr. Walter wanted you to have it.

22:28.657 --> 22:32.244
He said he was breaking
all of his rules whatever they are.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.997
It was just for you he said.

22:40.878 --> 22:42.004
Is Clara your first wife.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.258
Oh no no no no... we’re not married.

22:49.386 --> 22:50.888
There have been others

22:51.263 --> 22:53.307
I mean you’ve been not married
a few times.

22:59.062 --> 23:01.189
The nearly wives.
The ones that got away.

23:02.357 --> 23:03.692
Was Mrs. Epstein one of them.

23:04.693 --> 23:06.236
She might see it that way.

23:09.573 --> 23:12.826
- Children.
- A daughter not Clara’s.

23:15.370 --> 23:17.623
Clara’s been checking
every detail with your publisher.

23:18.415 --> 23:20.083
She’s putting her soul into this.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.879
The cover the entire campaign...
she begged everybody for a blurb.

23:24.212 --> 23:25.881
She went to the hotel to see
if it was OK

23:26.214 --> 23:27.674
working like a dog on her internship

23:28.008 --> 23:29.384
without pay.

23:29.718 --> 23:31.845
I know. I cannot do without her.

23:36.475 --> 23:38.185
I think my jacket is a mistake.

23:38.977 --> 23:40.979
- I know.
- So why did you bring it

23:41.355 --> 23:43.148
I don’t look like a writer.

23:43.482 --> 23:45.150
Nobody wants to look like a writer.

23:46.151 --> 23:47.271
Do you want to look like one.

23:47.569 --> 23:50.656
Yeah I do.
No no I don’t. But...

23:52.783 --> 23:54.785
Do I look like a European
antique dealer.

23:55.118 --> 23:58.830
Well like a European antique dealer
on a bad day for European antiques.

23:59.581 --> 24:00.791
Thank you.

24:01.416 --> 24:02.501
You're welcome.

24:05.295 --> 24:07.047
Oh wow Look at you.

24:08.465 --> 24:10.801
- Think it’s all right.
- Absolutely.

24:12.803 --> 24:14.471
We have a car tonight.

24:15.013 --> 24:16.223
It’s your big night.

24:21.979 --> 24:23.271
- How are you.
- Very good.

24:23.605 --> 24:25.816
- It’s a packed house.
- Yeah.

24:26.858 --> 24:27.859
Oh look who’s here.

24:29.194 --> 24:31.196
- How is...
- You are very welcome. Come in.

24:31.697 --> 24:33.365
There are a lot of people here already.

24:33.865 --> 24:37.619
Remember this is the smartest audience
you’re ever going to get.

24:38.495 --> 24:41.873
When my father spoke about what matters
and what does not matter

24:42.249 --> 24:43.875
an image came to me

24:44.209 --> 24:45.627
an image of two women.

24:46.294 --> 24:48.463
One whom I caused harm...

24:49.798 --> 24:53.218
The other who I should be with now
if I’d been wiser then

24:54.094 --> 24:55.137
whom I wonder about still.

24:56.555 --> 24:58.223
I met in New York.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.271
It was a few years
after the wall had come down

25:04.604 --> 25:07.482
and I was happy to get away
from all the agitation of Berlin.

25:07.816 --> 25:09.901
My novel got me a fellowship

25:10.235 --> 25:13.697
and I had a tiny office
at the Public Library.

25:14.823 --> 25:17.284
Yes here upstairs on the 4th floor.

25:18.869 --> 25:21.246
I first met her at an art opening

25:22.039 --> 25:25.500
or rather outside an art opening since
there were too many people inside.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.880
My friend from the library
with whom I’d come was a smoker

25:30.213 --> 25:31.882
so I was standing outside with him.

25:32.716 --> 25:34.217
We watched her arrive

25:34.926 --> 25:38.764
we studied her as she saw the crowds
and decided to step back

25:40.015 --> 25:42.059
then she turned and
smiled at my friend.

25:43.143 --> 25:45.729
She barely looked at me
as she shook my hand.

25:47.147 --> 25:50.400
The following Sunday
I watched her a second time

25:50.734 --> 25:53.528
as she arrived at the Alice Tully Hall
alone

25:53.862 --> 25:55.572
for the 5 o’clock concert.

25:59.117 --> 26:01.495
I was alone too already in my seat.

26:05.707 --> 26:08.710
As she took her seat
she looked at me for a brief second

26:09.336 --> 26:10.545
but she did not say anything

26:10.879 --> 26:13.465
and I believed
that she did not recognize me.

26:17.803 --> 26:19.054
I liked her.

26:24.518 --> 26:29.064
But before the concert began
she turned and said.

26:29.397 --> 26:31.983
You are at the library” and smiled.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.529
It’s one of the great places”
she added.

26:38.115 --> 26:39.825
As the music played.

26:41.034 --> 26:43.662
I felt a loneliness that was new to me.

26:45.163 --> 26:47.624
I did not want her to leave
at the end of the concert

26:47.958 --> 26:50.669
but there was nothing
I could think to say to her

26:51.169 --> 26:53.463
so I walked ahead of her
towards the exit

26:53.880 --> 26:55.841
as though I had somewhere to go.

26:57.175 --> 26:58.677
That is how it began.

26:59.386 --> 27:00.679
We soon met again.

27:01.179 --> 27:04.182
We spent many nights together
and whole weekends

27:04.683 --> 27:06.518
and we went out to the country

27:07.018 --> 27:08.895
where the sky was grey and low

27:09.479 --> 27:12.315
and the wind was icy
and the roads deserted.

27:12.983 --> 27:14.985
Maybe that was the best time we had

27:15.652 --> 27:17.737
the closest we ever got to each other.

27:19.406 --> 27:20.991
I’m trying not to say

27:21.783 --> 27:24.244
that I loved her more
than I’ve ever loved anyone

27:24.995 --> 27:26.204
or ever will.

27:27.038 --> 27:28.081
Words are banal.

27:28.415 --> 27:30.792
They belong to songs
and sentimentality.

27:31.877 --> 27:33.211
But what else can I say.

27:34.296 --> 27:36.381
Are there other words that I can use.

27:38.508 --> 27:40.969
Perhaps there’s a need for me to add
that she was

27:41.595 --> 27:44.347
beautiful and original
as well as distant

27:46.141 --> 27:47.225
and intriguing.

27:49.102 --> 27:52.689
I’m not sure these words either
or any other words can help me now.

27:54.357 --> 27:56.193
Now that the time has passed.

27:57.819 --> 27:59.779
She was the great chance I had.

28:00.447 --> 28:01.948
The chance I lost.

28:03.617 --> 28:05.160
The one who mattered.

28:08.079 --> 28:10.457
Over the years
she became one of my ghosts

28:11.458 --> 28:15.045
until one day I started to think
that I might go to New York again

28:15.712 --> 28:18.548
when a book of mine came out
from a publisher there

28:19.591 --> 28:21.468
and see the city again

28:22.052 --> 28:24.012
and maybe run into her

28:25.096 --> 28:28.725
and pretend
that the past does not matter.

28:31.102 --> 28:32.312
And here I am.

28:41.780 --> 28:42.948
Thank you.

28:49.079 --> 28:51.331
Maybe in his next book it will be you.

28:55.210 --> 28:56.628
I hope not.

28:57.379 --> 28:58.797
Could you please sign my book.

29:22.946 --> 29:26.491
It makes a difference if the Hungarians
are actually from Hungary doesn’t it.

29:26.825 --> 29:28.618
Brought up there in that culture.

29:29.244 --> 29:30.287
I mean those haircuts.

29:30.787 --> 29:33.915
I liked the second violinist
but I like them all.

29:34.249 --> 29:36.626
Dedicated. They are
dedicated musicians.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.378
My first boyfriend was Hungarian.

29:38.712 --> 29:42.632
I mean not real brought up in Hungary
Hungarian. His parents came here in ’56.

29:42.966 --> 29:44.301
He got in touch with me recently.

29:44.634 --> 29:47.554
He has this big Hungarian laugh.
I mean it beats...

29:48.138 --> 29:51.599
- So did you meet him.
- Wait. He looks really nice now.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.811
He’s thoughtful and skinny now
like a Columbia professor.

29:55.145 --> 29:57.397
- So you met him.
- Yeah I met him.

29:57.939 --> 30:00.025
I mean we even...

30:01.568 --> 30:04.446
- You what.
- Yeah we did.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.490
It was nice. It was sweet.

30:07.824 --> 30:09.909
I mean that’s what New York is for.

30:10.285 --> 30:11.786
That is why my rent is so high.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.956
In other places people fade away
but here they always come back.

30:15.290 --> 30:17.792
Speaking of old friends coming back
I got a call from someone

30:18.126 --> 30:19.753
I haven’t seen in ages.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.379
Where’s he been hiding.

30:21.713 --> 30:23.465
Last time I heard of him
he was in Berlin.

30:23.798 --> 30:25.008
Oh no not German.

30:25.342 --> 30:27.177
I don’t do Germans. I never have.

30:27.510 --> 30:29.596
Not that any opportunity
has ever come my way.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.014
I don’t blame you.

30:33.350 --> 30:35.518
I meet him the first time...

30:36.728 --> 30:38.229
no the second time

30:38.563 --> 30:40.398
in that hall we were in tonight.

30:41.149 --> 30:42.359
He’s a writer.

30:42.692 --> 30:44.903
He has a reading
at the Public Library tonight.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.946
That’s why we went to the concert.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.282
He has a reading
and we went to the concert.

30:53.078 --> 30:54.412
Is he the one...

30:56.915 --> 30:58.666
It was a long time ago

30:59.876 --> 31:03.922
and I never really got over it.
I know other people do. I didn’t.

31:04.547 --> 31:06.966
No one ever gets over anything.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.681
- Shall we get one.
- Yeah.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.061
Hi Mr. Zorn. Please for Bill.

31:18.686 --> 31:20.230
What a fabulous novel it is too sir.

31:21.815 --> 31:22.816
Thank you sir very much.

31:24.192 --> 31:25.318
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:30.407 --> 31:31.449
Let me see.

31:32.534 --> 31:34.828
- I really loved the reading.
- Thank you.

32:03.773 --> 32:06.484
All these guys
want to be David Foster Wallace.

32:06.818 --> 32:08.862
Every one of them. Literally.

32:09.779 --> 32:11.364
So you mean they’d prefer to be dead.

32:11.698 --> 32:14.868
If it meant fame then sure of course.
Why not.

32:15.201 --> 32:18.413
- Maybe they’d prefer to be Don DeLillo.
- Hey What are you guys drinking.

32:18.746 --> 32:20.999
This is Sex on the Beach
with an extra twist.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.877
- Of what.
- Of moaning.

32:34.679 --> 32:35.889
- Are you happy.
- Hey yes.

32:38.766 --> 32:40.643
Please join me in raising my glass

32:40.977 --> 32:44.689
to someone
whom I not only consider to be a genius

32:45.523 --> 32:47.275
but also my friend.

32:47.692 --> 32:49.277
To Max Zorn.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.365
Thank you thank you...

32:56.034 --> 32:58.536
- Good job Max.
- Thank you.

33:00.038 --> 33:02.373
I’m not sure about your choices though.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.335
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:06.503 --> 33:08.671
Maybe a bit more tact.

33:10.882 --> 33:12.634
Tact is boring.

33:16.804 --> 33:18.515
Hey up there Up there Look.

33:19.516 --> 33:21.643
- There’s nothing up there.
- Look over there...

33:21.976 --> 33:23.436
Somebody try this one here.

33:23.770 --> 33:25.688
That’s all it is...

33:26.022 --> 33:27.941
Is it the right street.

33:29.317 --> 33:30.985
Follow the perfume.

33:32.028 --> 33:33.028
Wait...

33:54.676 --> 33:55.718
Henry James once said

33:56.052 --> 33:58.346
it is time to start living
the life you imagine

33:58.680 --> 34:02.141
but I say it is time
we started living the life we deserve

34:32.672 --> 34:35.007
Roderick what’s his name
what he’s doing.

34:35.592 --> 34:36.801
He does what you all do

34:37.135 --> 34:39.219
he makes up stories
and thinks about girls.

34:42.599 --> 34:45.059
- Is he good.
- He thinks his stories are good.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.103
He’s probably wrong about that.

34:47.937 --> 34:49.230
He’s not wrong about the girls.

34:52.650 --> 34:53.818
Have you known him for long.

34:54.152 --> 34:56.112
I’ve done publicity
for a few of his books.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.865
- I like him and he’s respected.
- Oh yeah.

34:59.449 --> 35:02.076
Stop it He’s working with Clara.
He’s doing a great job.

35:02.410 --> 35:04.871
Yeah they’re both doing a great job.

35:05.663 --> 35:09.375
Hey stop it. Address further inquiries
to Shakespeare and Shakespeare.

35:09.709 --> 35:12.837
This call may be monitored
for quality and training purposes.

35:48.039 --> 35:49.123
Taxi.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.484
Is that him Your philosopher.

36:16.943 --> 36:18.236
He’s not a philosopher.

36:20.071 --> 36:22.990
It’s 11.45.
It’s 15 minutes past my bedtime.

36:23.533 --> 36:24.575
Let me inspect him.

36:25.952 --> 36:27.453
Don’t be nervous.

36:28.413 --> 36:31.416
- I don’t know who he is anymore.
- We’re about to find out.

36:31.749 --> 36:33.960
What for I don’t know...

36:34.836 --> 36:35.962
I know this makes no sense.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.175
I really don’t want him
calling round like this.

36:41.592 --> 36:43.219
I can guess who gave him the address.

36:43.553 --> 36:46.597
To hell with it. Let me check him out.

36:59.777 --> 37:02.238
You had a reading. How did it go.

37:02.989 --> 37:06.033
This is Rachel my best friend
and cat keeper.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.369
Hi.

37:08.828 --> 37:12.665
She does other things too.
I mean in fact she runs the country.

37:16.043 --> 37:18.463
Rachel stop staring.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.424
- Would you like a drink.
- Yeah

37:22.216 --> 37:24.802
or maybe I shouldn’t... just coffee
that’s fine.

37:25.178 --> 37:26.637
I can make you coffee.

37:28.222 --> 37:30.683
I can also help you
to stop gaping at everything.

37:31.434 --> 37:33.144
How are you going to do that.

37:34.604 --> 37:36.147
By calling for help against a stalker.

37:37.482 --> 37:40.318
I can make some coffee.
You show him around Becky.

37:50.578 --> 37:51.578
Is this your place.

37:53.122 --> 37:55.875
No I just come here
to do the cleaning at night.

37:56.501 --> 37:57.752
Seriously.

37:59.045 --> 38:01.005
You were never serious when I knew you.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.177
Deep inside I’m serious.

38:07.094 --> 38:10.181
I’m glad I never knew that side of you
the one that’s deep inside”..

38:10.515 --> 38:12.600
I’m glad you kept that to yourself.

38:14.477 --> 38:16.062
Did you buy this place.

38:17.313 --> 38:18.856
Yes. How did you think I got it.

38:20.107 --> 38:22.151
- With money you made.
- Money I made.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.988
What sort of law do you do.

38:27.073 --> 38:29.617
I worked for the District Attorney
as a prosecutor.

38:30.201 --> 38:33.371
And then I got hired by a law firm
and moved over to the other side.

38:34.163 --> 38:37.208
Then I got hired by another law firm
bigger and better.

38:37.959 --> 38:40.119
If you want to stay out of jail
and have a lot of money

38:40.378 --> 38:43.005
at some stage of the game
you spend time in my office.

38:44.632 --> 38:46.884
O.J. Strauss-Kahn cases like that.

38:47.677 --> 38:49.971
- I didn’t do them.
- But you could have.

38:50.304 --> 38:53.933
It’s more about finance mergers
insider trading stuff like that.

38:54.725 --> 38:55.725
Madoff.

38:57.228 --> 38:59.105
I don’t discuss clients with strangers.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.691
But you understand all that.

39:05.361 --> 39:08.614
No if I were in trouble I’d hire you.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.201
You couldn’t afford me.

39:15.913 --> 39:16.956
You put on weight.

39:17.832 --> 39:19.917
I told the cats you’d be thinner.

39:22.169 --> 39:24.255
Is that why they’re staring so at me.

39:24.589 --> 39:25.631
No.

39:26.257 --> 39:29.468
They don’t like me having
unannounced gentlemen callers at night.

39:38.269 --> 39:39.269
Now I get you.

39:40.396 --> 39:43.900
I would go to Syracuse with him
or Boulder Colorado.

39:44.275 --> 39:46.485
I would go to the armpit
of the universe.

39:46.819 --> 39:47.608
I mean he is...

39:47.638 --> 39:49.322
- Sweet and smart. Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:50.197 --> 39:52.241
But the nerve to come here at night.

39:52.575 --> 39:54.619
- Now don’t stare at him.
- I don’t stare...

39:54.952 --> 39:56.454
What are you two talking about.

39:58.414 --> 40:02.126
I was expecting a big piece
of Wiener Schnitzel to appear

40:02.460 --> 40:04.629
and I am merely expressing my surprise.

40:06.339 --> 40:07.673
- Sugar.
- No thanks.

40:08.007 --> 40:09.759
We should all go home
and go to bed now.

40:11.218 --> 40:15.306
I’m sure the jetlag caused him to feel
he could come round here this late.

40:17.141 --> 40:18.935
No I’m the one splitting.

40:32.782 --> 40:33.782
Nightie night.

40:34.492 --> 40:37.954
Max is staying at the Algonquin.
Would you offer him a ride.

40:39.914 --> 40:40.957
Sure.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.129
- Thanks.
- The pleasure is all mine.

40:55.721 --> 40:56.722
Let me ask you something.

40:57.932 --> 40:59.308
Is Rebecca alone.

41:00.226 --> 41:03.187
I mean how does she live
Is there someone she...

41:04.021 --> 41:05.606
Maybe you should ask her.

41:07.108 --> 41:08.609
I’m asking you.

41:09.568 --> 41:10.987
And what about you.

41:16.325 --> 41:19.328
I’m sure she was happy to see you.
Does that answer your question.

41:22.123 --> 41:23.958
- Thanks John.
- You’re welcome madam.

41:26.794 --> 41:30.631
I hope you don’t mind
but I think I’d rather walk.

41:30.965 --> 41:32.258
Do I scare you that much

41:32.591 --> 41:35.886
I don’t scare that easy
but I really need it.

41:36.721 --> 41:38.055
The walk the air you know.

41:39.432 --> 41:40.558
Jet lag.

41:41.100 --> 41:42.560
Rebecca’s always right.

42:25.186 --> 42:26.312
- Good morning.
- Morning.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.147
We almost called the FBI.

42:28.856 --> 42:30.441
Why do you always vanish.

42:32.276 --> 42:34.361
I took a walk I got lost and then

42:34.695 --> 42:36.781
finally I took a cab back to the hotel.

42:39.450 --> 42:40.659
We were there until 4 dancing.

42:41.035 --> 42:44.663
Then we went to that other place which
was full of Bulgarians crazy dancing

42:45.164 --> 42:46.290
polka and vodka.

42:53.089 --> 42:54.215
What are you thinking.

42:54.965 --> 42:55.965
I am not thinking.

42:57.301 --> 42:59.261
Yes you are. I can hear it.

43:02.056 --> 43:05.601
I’m thinking that my wife thinks that
some undereducated American proof-reader

43:06.060 --> 43:07.603
is a fucking guru

43:08.479 --> 43:10.856
and I can smell his idiocy from her

43:11.190 --> 43:12.775
when she comes into the room.

43:17.279 --> 43:19.907
And I missed you
when I got back last night.

43:21.534 --> 43:22.785
I’m here now.

43:23.494 --> 43:26.080
You’re here. That’s what matters.

43:46.559 --> 43:48.310
Listen to this.

43:51.939 --> 43:54.942
Lindsey, this is Rebecca Epstein
with a message for Mr. Zorn.

43:55.442 --> 43:59.238
I have time on Saturday. If he wants
to come, I have to drive somewhere

43:59.572 --> 44:01.115
on the far end of Long Island.

44:01.448 --> 44:03.367
Departure from my place at 11 a.m.

44:04.076 --> 44:05.911
We'll be back late afternoon.

44:06.370 --> 44:09.248
If it's OK, no need to call back.
He knows the address.

44:12.835 --> 44:14.461
She picked Montauk.

44:15.421 --> 44:16.421
The place at the far end.

44:19.216 --> 44:21.635
You are free this weekend.
Shall I pencil in.

44:23.888 --> 44:24.889
Why not.

44:28.684 --> 44:30.144
So what’s up next.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.105
Times. A brunch.

44:33.772 --> 44:36.108
- And what’s this about Saturday.
- Montauk.

44:38.110 --> 44:39.737
Montauk.

44:41.739 --> 44:45.159
Yeah there’s this place
it’s an arts center

44:45.784 --> 44:47.119
with people he needs to meet.

44:47.453 --> 44:50.164
Oh come on Max please.
Julia’s doing a party for us.

44:51.457 --> 44:52.875
I’II be back in time.

45:01.759 --> 45:04.261
I don’t think I’ve told a lie
for an author or for anyone else

45:04.553 --> 45:06.180
since I started in my job.

45:07.681 --> 45:09.183
I’m sure she noticed.

45:10.684 --> 45:12.394
That’s the last lie I’m telling OK.

45:13.145 --> 45:14.188
OK.

45:18.192 --> 45:20.152
And what will happen in Montauk.

45:21.737 --> 45:22.905
I don’t know.

45:23.781 --> 45:25.407
And Clara doesn’t even know she exists.

45:26.075 --> 45:27.952
No she doesn’t. At least I hope so.

45:28.410 --> 45:29.453
Why.

45:29.787 --> 45:31.914
Because I love Clara.
I don’t want to hurt her.

45:33.249 --> 45:34.541
I mean it makes no sense.

45:34.875 --> 45:38.254
Why do you want to see Rebecca
now that you have Clara.

45:39.964 --> 45:41.465
I can’t explain it.

45:42.758 --> 45:45.552
I don’t want to have lost her
even though it was long ago.

45:45.886 --> 45:47.513
I do not want to have lost her.

45:54.228 --> 45:56.981
Even when I was in high school
if a guy did that...

45:57.523 --> 46:00.109
coming all the way from Europe
and then seeing someone else...

46:00.734 --> 46:03.696
- You know what I would do.
- What would you do.

46:04.363 --> 46:05.739
I’d cut his balls off.

46:07.324 --> 46:08.367
Yeah.

46:11.287 --> 46:13.706
Don’t you have
any firm positions anymore.

46:14.039 --> 46:16.041
Yes I do. But I’m...

46:17.042 --> 46:21.130
I’m not a tree. It has roots. It stands
in one place it has a position.

46:21.714 --> 46:24.341
I’m an animal.
I'm wild I move I change position.

46:25.050 --> 46:26.093
I’m flexible.

46:27.886 --> 46:30.931
...still don’t change their way
of treating economy.

46:31.432 --> 46:36.603
Because the power is...
Financial power...

46:36.937 --> 46:39.315
Walter Are you following me.

46:39.648 --> 46:43.360
No it's pure coincidence.
I lunch here almost every day.

46:44.028 --> 46:46.989
I really want you to come to my home.

46:47.406 --> 46:48.949
- Bring your wife.
- OK.

46:50.075 --> 46:51.702
I’m very lonely you know.

46:52.786 --> 46:54.371
- You live alone.
- Yes.

46:54.705 --> 46:57.416
New York is a city
that's conducive to solitude.

46:57.916 --> 47:00.461
At least that's how I conceived it.

47:01.712 --> 47:02.838
You designed the city.

47:03.172 --> 47:04.631
Yes why not.

47:05.257 --> 47:07.468
- So it's a promise See you soon.
- OK.

47:09.887 --> 47:12.014
I have the painting for you.

47:13.390 --> 47:15.059
The Paul Klee.

47:18.312 --> 47:21.065
I’m seeing Walter for lunch on Monday.
Monday.

47:21.398 --> 47:22.566
I’II put it in the schedule.

47:22.900 --> 47:26.362
He wants you to come along as well
and Clara.

47:26.737 --> 47:30.074
Great. I can’t wait to see his
collection... of dead bodies.

47:33.410 --> 47:34.995
This jacket is completely wrong.

47:36.288 --> 47:38.415
You know it’s special.

47:42.503 --> 47:46.173
No Walter he introduced me to art
and to literature.

47:46.548 --> 47:49.635
As a student
I admired him beyond reason.

47:50.010 --> 47:51.929
I was intimidated.
I...

47:52.679 --> 47:54.139
I needed someone to watch over me.

47:54.515 --> 47:56.600
- That’s Walter for you.
- Here we are.

48:00.104 --> 48:02.773
When I began to write
and publish my first things

48:03.107 --> 48:04.817
in newspapers
and even my first novel

48:05.150 --> 48:06.360
he dismissed it.

48:06.693 --> 48:08.153
He said Anybody could do that”.

48:08.487 --> 48:11.115
But in French.

48:12.449 --> 48:14.410
It’s not that she’s neglecting her kids

48:15.327 --> 48:17.746
it’s more that she’s so stressed
and in pain

48:18.205 --> 48:20.707
that she can’t really let them
into her life.

48:21.041 --> 48:22.918
The book is about his mother.

48:29.341 --> 48:31.385
You know I could put this up for you.

48:31.718 --> 48:32.761
Oh I don’t know.

48:33.095 --> 48:35.472
I was never the right shape for clothes.
- But you are...

48:36.098 --> 48:39.476
your shoulders are perfect Look at you.

48:40.227 --> 48:41.895
Thank you. Well OK.

48:44.648 --> 48:45.691
May I.

48:50.195 --> 48:51.238
Voila.

48:52.990 --> 48:57.619
Walter had a house in Tuscany and
at the end of summer a woman came.

48:57.995 --> 49:00.747
Since Walter didn’t sleep with her
it seemed natural that I would

49:01.081 --> 49:02.666
even though she was older than I.

49:07.212 --> 49:09.089
They break in all the time.

49:10.257 --> 49:12.134
They stole my flat screen.

49:15.596 --> 49:16.756
You have to put on the pants.

49:19.808 --> 49:21.768
How much rent do you pay for this.

49:22.311 --> 49:24.146
- Fifteen.
- Out of...

49:25.647 --> 49:27.232
You don’t want to know.

49:29.651 --> 49:32.613
After lunch one day Walter fell asleep.

49:33.739 --> 49:34.907
He looked like a lizard

49:35.240 --> 49:38.619
in repose with his mouth open
and his eyes closed.

49:39.119 --> 49:40.621
She looked at him

49:40.996 --> 49:43.332
and then she looked at me like a child

49:43.707 --> 49:45.959
moving towards something sweet
and forbidden.

49:46.543 --> 49:49.546
I believe even when she removed
his wallet from his inside pocket

49:49.880 --> 49:52.132
and looked at me again
her face full of mischief

49:52.549 --> 49:55.010
she had no idea what we would be doing

49:55.469 --> 49:59.223
and smiled at me again
as if she’d done something brave

49:59.598 --> 50:01.350
as she handed me the credit cards.

50:02.017 --> 50:04.019
Then she put her finger to her lips
and...

50:08.565 --> 50:10.734
We stole out of that
house with nothing.

50:11.610 --> 50:13.862
No luggage no guilt either.

50:14.488 --> 50:17.991
Only at the railway station as I
had to queue for an overnight sleeper

50:18.325 --> 50:19.785
did I worry about getting caught.

50:20.369 --> 50:24.331
But the thought of fucking her as the
train crossed the Apennine mountains

50:24.665 --> 50:27.125
and then fucking her again in daylight
on the way to Venice

50:27.459 --> 50:31.004
with the blinds open
and the peasants working outside

50:31.380 --> 50:34.883
and then fucking her again in Venice
with the water lapping outside

50:35.217 --> 50:37.344
it removed all thoughts
of guilt or fear.

50:37.761 --> 50:39.263
You could have gone to jail.

50:41.557 --> 50:44.226
Lindsey
this may just be a story I made up.

50:45.143 --> 50:46.812
Never believe anything
writers tell you.

50:48.480 --> 50:52.359
Fucking her on the train with the blinds
open you couldn’t have made that up.

51:01.326 --> 51:04.087
It’s a nice place in Brooklyn and we
planned it so you would be there.

51:06.248 --> 51:08.667
- When are you coming back.
- In time for the party I hope.

51:09.001 --> 51:12.170
It’s just a panel... talk talk talk...

51:14.840 --> 51:17.050
- When are you leaving.
- I don’t know.

51:17.926 --> 51:18.926
I have to call Lindsey.

51:19.928 --> 51:21.847
She’s a busy girl Lindsey.

51:23.515 --> 51:25.642
I don’t know
how she puts up with all you guys.

51:30.647 --> 51:31.647
Just don’t be too late.

51:32.190 --> 51:33.692
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

52:06.933 --> 52:09.269
They know I’m going
I told them earlier.

52:09.811 --> 52:13.440
I snuck my bag down to the car but they
spotted me and suspected something.

52:14.358 --> 52:16.485
So I came clean and I told them.

52:16.818 --> 52:18.070
What are they called

52:18.779 --> 52:20.322
Crosby Stills and Nash.

52:20.697 --> 52:21.865
Oh the band.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.909
Wasn’t there a 4th member.

52:24.242 --> 52:25.535
Who’s a clever boy.

52:27.454 --> 52:29.915
What happens if one of them dies
It won’t be the same.

52:31.458 --> 52:33.293
One of them won’t die.

52:33.710 --> 52:34.836
I forgot

52:35.420 --> 52:36.797
it’s America.

52:37.506 --> 52:39.758
Well they do look like
a bad rock band all right.

52:54.356 --> 52:56.650
This scent your perfume
I can’t trace it.

52:58.276 --> 53:00.404
I don’t wear perfume.
It must be the soap.

53:01.071 --> 53:02.071
What soap is it.

53:03.115 --> 53:05.033
It has no name.
I have it specially made.

53:06.284 --> 53:07.327
What.

53:09.246 --> 53:10.455
Yeah you heard me.

53:11.123 --> 53:15.043
It’s a little lesbian lady and another
little lesbian lady in Connecticut.

53:15.377 --> 53:17.879
You talk to them
and they tell you what soap you are.

53:18.922 --> 53:20.090
You are.

53:20.424 --> 53:22.300
Yeah you are.

53:24.428 --> 53:25.512
Voila.

53:26.346 --> 53:29.141
How did that happen How did they know
we were coming out now.

53:29.599 --> 53:31.643
I guess they guessed. What do you think

53:31.977 --> 53:34.896
I think a lesbian little old lady
in Connecticut called them.

53:35.230 --> 53:37.524
Very smart. You must be a writer.
Are you Max.

53:37.941 --> 53:40.861
- Yes I am.
- I thought so. Thank you John.

53:41.611 --> 53:43.572
I just have to pick up a few things.

53:59.171 --> 54:00.297
Thank you.

54:00.630 --> 54:03.633
- I’d love to be your valet.
- That would be great.

54:08.138 --> 54:10.015
I can’t believe we’re doing this.

54:11.224 --> 54:12.392
Look at what you’re wearing.

54:13.560 --> 54:15.729
It’s OK It’s a bit wrinkled.

54:16.313 --> 54:17.355
Very hip.

54:17.939 --> 54:19.979
I wouldn’t advise you to wear it in court.
- Why not.

54:20.942 --> 54:24.070
The accused always has to wear a good suit.
- Even if he’s innocent.

54:25.238 --> 54:27.407
They’re all innocent
until the law decides otherwise.

54:29.826 --> 54:31.244
- Any more errands.
- Nope.

55:00.732 --> 55:02.442
- Have you ever been there since.
- Where.

55:02.818 --> 55:03.902
Montauk.

55:05.153 --> 55:06.196
Why.

55:06.530 --> 55:08.281
Well that’s where we’re going isn’t it.

55:10.867 --> 55:13.203
Come on
you said the far end of the island.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.876
Does the cat minder sleep
in the apartment when you’re away - No.

55:20.210 --> 55:23.880
I’m just trying to piece it all
together your... know how you live.

55:24.673 --> 55:26.591
Relax put on music.

55:29.845 --> 55:33.098
- Where is the music.
- You used to know cars.

55:34.516 --> 55:36.184
Well I’m a poor writer. Less than poor.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.019
I don’t have a car anymore.

55:38.395 --> 55:39.479
This I don’t believe.

55:39.771 --> 55:40.939
No it’s true.

55:41.523 --> 55:44.234
I’m broke. Broke for now.

55:46.403 --> 55:49.531
I don't read much. When I am writing,
I find reading a distraction.

55:49.865 --> 55:51.157
I lock myself in a room.

55:51.491 --> 55:54.744
I don't need other authors. And then, in
the evening I listen to jazz maybe...

55:55.078 --> 55:57.163
- Might be better if he didn’t talk.
- Yeah.

55:58.748 --> 56:01.376
And in between writing your own books,
what do you read...

56:02.460 --> 56:05.088
- I went to college with him.
- Really.

56:05.463 --> 56:06.756
What was he like.

56:07.674 --> 56:10.844
There were a lot of guys like him.
They bored me.

56:11.511 --> 56:12.846
They took you out on dates

56:13.179 --> 56:14.806
and talked about themselves

56:16.182 --> 56:20.353
and then told you it was your turn
you could talk about yourself now.

56:21.229 --> 56:24.816
They knew that if they didn’t let you
talk some you might not sleep with them.

56:25.775 --> 56:26.985
Did you sleep with them.

56:27.652 --> 56:28.695
Sure.

56:30.739 --> 56:31.819
Did you sleep with that guy.

56:32.324 --> 56:33.950
Did you sleep with the illiterate guy

56:34.284 --> 56:36.369
I think we fooled around a few times.

56:36.703 --> 56:40.040
Because it pays a very little attention
to the way the world really works...

56:40.415 --> 56:43.168
I thought I was special
when you fooled around with me.

56:43.793 --> 56:45.420
I never fooled around with you.

56:45.754 --> 56:48.882
I was a very very angry
idealistic young person myself.

56:49.215 --> 56:50.884
So I know whereof I speak.

56:57.682 --> 56:59.142
At Budokan.

57:09.945 --> 57:10.987
I want you,

57:12.238 --> 57:13.281
I want you,

57:14.824 --> 57:17.869
I want you, so bad...

57:19.120 --> 57:21.748
I went through years
of needing to hear this song

57:22.457 --> 57:23.625
and needing not to hear it.

57:25.126 --> 57:29.756
We listened to it on the way
out there... and on the way back.

57:30.173 --> 57:31.716
I have total recall.

57:52.821 --> 57:54.447
Did you read what I wrote in the book

57:54.823 --> 57:56.324
about our time together.

57:59.577 --> 58:00.954
I only leafed through it.

58:03.164 --> 58:04.624
Did you have a problem with it.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.584
I was surprised.

58:08.586 --> 58:11.172
Maybe more surprised about
the parts you invented.

58:12.007 --> 58:13.633
I didn’t invent much.

58:29.858 --> 58:31.192
We’re almost there.

58:32.527 --> 58:34.237
This house I have to look at.

58:35.780 --> 58:37.949
It’s something I should have done
a few months ago.

58:38.700 --> 58:41.870
One of my colleagues is selling a house
if someone offered him the right price.

58:42.328 --> 58:45.623
I told him I’d look at it at the end of
the summer and then I changed my mind.

58:46.416 --> 58:48.001
Are you buying it for yourself.

58:49.252 --> 58:50.962
My parents live in Dresden.

58:51.963 --> 58:54.758
They’re old
could come over and live here.

58:55.425 --> 58:57.802
But I haven’t mentioned it to them
it’s just an idea I had.

58:58.970 --> 59:00.555
I had a place once in Maine

59:01.848 --> 59:04.601
but I got just a few good weekends
out of it so I sold it.

59:05.060 --> 59:06.144
It’s funny.

59:07.312 --> 59:11.232
I didn’t use it when I had it
and then I missed it when I sold it.

59:13.193 --> 59:14.319
Do you visit your parents.

59:15.195 --> 59:18.031
I did a few times.
Then I decided never to go back there.

59:19.532 --> 59:20.575
What happened.

59:20.909 --> 59:23.703
Nothing special. I just
didn’t want to be there anymore.

59:24.162 --> 59:25.882
That was the part of you
I never understood.

59:27.123 --> 59:28.833
You never understood anything.

01:00:08.748 --> 01:00:09.874
Here’s a sweater.

01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:11.793
Thank you.

01:00:32.814 --> 01:00:34.399
Hello.

01:00:36.401 --> 01:00:37.485
Hello.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:51.708
- Let’s wait a bit.
- I’m not waiting.

01:00:56.838 --> 01:00:58.423
They said they’d be here.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:05.346
Don’t trespass.

01:01:14.647 --> 01:01:16.065
I really needed to look at it.

01:01:16.441 --> 01:01:19.319
Thanks for coming along.
We can grab a bite on the way back.

01:01:25.283 --> 01:01:26.618
We didn’t have this before.

01:01:27.035 --> 01:01:28.161
Your taste is deepening.

01:01:29.537 --> 01:01:30.537
Stop it.

01:01:31.998 --> 01:01:35.210
People are so unreliable you know.
I told him I’d be here by noon.

01:01:36.002 --> 01:01:37.170
Eighty miles for nothing.

01:01:37.462 --> 01:01:40.131
Don’t be angry.
- Why shouldn’t I - It’s so American.

01:01:40.465 --> 01:01:41.507
What does that mean.

01:01:41.841 --> 01:01:44.510
All this efficiency
You’re so relentless pedantic.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.889
Is this East Germany
meeting its match in America.

01:01:48.223 --> 01:01:50.433
Stop it or get out of the car.

01:01:53.186 --> 01:01:54.771
Where’s your sense of humor.

01:01:59.776 --> 01:02:01.444
You’re driving in the wrong direction.

01:02:01.778 --> 01:02:04.239
It may be wrong
but that’s where we’re going.

01:02:21.547 --> 01:02:23.967
That’s good... They can’t get more.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.062
I’II get some branches.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.965
Hello...

01:03:07.802 --> 01:03:08.802
Bye.

01:03:13.474 --> 01:03:16.060
They’II send someone tomorrow
to open the house.

01:03:18.313 --> 01:03:19.397
On the Sunday.

01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:24.235
I think I have to stay
somewhere out here.

01:03:26.195 --> 01:03:28.031
I can drive you back.

01:03:29.198 --> 01:03:31.326
Or drop you off at a bus
or there’s a train too.

01:03:34.245 --> 01:03:35.371
I’m not going anywhere.

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:40.418
Sure this is not a problem.

01:03:42.462 --> 01:03:43.629
An enormous one

01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:45.968
but one I can handle
if you stop shouting at me.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:58.936
No I mean Lindsey said
you have to be back tonight.

01:03:59.479 --> 01:04:01.898
Yeah and you said
you have to look at the house tomorrow.

01:04:06.861 --> 01:04:08.988
Let me call the tow truck.

01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:18.373
OK thank you.

01:04:49.612 --> 01:04:50.780
There’s 21.

01:04:53.866 --> 01:04:55.493
Here’s twenty...

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.454
23.

01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:01.374
- Here.
- OK.

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:03.501
See you in a bit.

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:05.211
Yeah...

01:05:34.824 --> 01:05:36.284
Look at that.

01:05:56.512 --> 01:05:58.764
If we don’t go now
it’s going to start to mist or rain

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.391
or it’II get dark.

01:06:01.726 --> 01:06:03.603
I need a walk.

01:06:19.744 --> 01:06:21.954
I need to call Rachel for the cats.

01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:24.832
And...

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:29.003
we should get toothbrushes
and stuff. Maybe some boots.

01:06:43.768 --> 01:06:45.770
There’s something different
about the hotel.

01:06:46.896 --> 01:06:47.939
No.

01:06:48.397 --> 01:06:50.274
Time has passed that’s all.

01:06:50.775 --> 01:06:52.401
The hotel is the same.

01:06:52.735 --> 01:06:54.153
It’s more imposing though.

01:06:54.779 --> 01:06:56.864
- It hasn’t changed.
- Have you changed.

01:06:57.323 --> 01:06:58.574
Yes I have.

01:06:58.908 --> 01:07:01.577
- In what way.
- In ways I don’t want to talk about.

01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:10.878
I take it you think
you’re still the same.

01:07:11.879 --> 01:07:13.714
Well I’m older I’m balder...

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:16.592
- I don’t mean that.
- II know what you mean...

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.803
Yeah a table for two please.

01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:03.556
OK lovely thank you.
See you later.

01:08:07.768 --> 01:08:11.522
Last time we saw this restaurant
and thought it was too expensive

01:08:11.856 --> 01:08:13.524
or else it was too full
do you remember.

01:08:17.111 --> 01:08:20.113
I checked the name of it and thought
this time we would go there.

01:08:20.448 --> 01:08:23.200
I can’t remember
having any food at all last time.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.953
We had bad chowder in some corner place
just down from here.

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:29.874
You hated it and I didn’t finish it.

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:31.667
I don’t remember that.

01:08:32.292 --> 01:08:34.295
I said it was homemade.

01:08:34.629 --> 01:08:36.546
And you said we were all homemade

01:08:36.839 --> 01:08:39.175
and maybe that was
the worst thing about us.

01:08:42.011 --> 01:08:43.345
What does that mean.

01:08:52.813 --> 01:08:53.898
Thanks.

01:09:09.205 --> 01:09:11.122
It was nice to be back at the library.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:13.834
I couldn’t make it.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:17.630
Well the reading would have been
embarrassing with you in the room.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.377
When I worked in the library

01:09:21.759 --> 01:09:24.220
I loved the manuscripts
more than the books.

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:28.724
Kafka and Twain and Nabokov...

01:09:33.895 --> 01:09:36.649
Weren’t you intimidated.
- No - No.

01:09:37.024 --> 01:09:39.026
No. On the contrary.

01:09:39.694 --> 01:09:43.447
Seeing how everyone who wrote started
with ordinary things trying out

01:09:43.738 --> 01:09:45.908
and when I saw those lines crossed out

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:47.451
whole pages...

01:09:47.785 --> 01:09:49.703
No one was ever sure
of what they were writing

01:09:50.328 --> 01:09:52.247
not when they started
not even the greatest.

01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:54.917
They were not yet fully formed.
They had to work.

01:09:58.713 --> 01:10:01.882
Once when I was a teenager
I learned an entire passage of Plato

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:03.884
to impress my father

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:07.263
only to be told that he knew it all
in the original Greek.

01:10:10.725 --> 01:10:12.560
You never grow up.

01:10:14.103 --> 01:10:15.354
For me it wasn’t funny at all.

01:10:15.688 --> 01:10:16.731
I know

01:10:17.064 --> 01:10:20.443
I almost cried
when you told me for the first time.

01:10:21.527 --> 01:10:22.987
- I did.
- Yeah.

01:10:23.446 --> 01:10:24.822
That’s how you got me.

01:10:25.948 --> 01:10:27.658
I was so innocent.

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:05.404
Just give me a minute please.

01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:51.862
When we drove out here
I wasn’t sure how it feel.

01:13:52.738 --> 01:13:54.615
I thought it was me who thought that.

01:13:56.033 --> 01:13:58.285
In a way this could be
the next day after the last time.

01:13:58.577 --> 01:13:59.912
Don’t speak.

01:14:03.457 --> 01:14:06.168
You used to say
that we were world champions.

01:14:08.212 --> 01:14:09.546
At being happy.

01:14:53.674 --> 01:14:55.467
The only thing that I promise myself

01:14:55.801 --> 01:14:57.886
that if I buy it I can’t sell it.

01:15:00.097 --> 01:15:02.307
No more moving or regretting.

01:15:04.226 --> 01:15:06.228
It’s only two hours from the city.

01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:08.105
I like the city.

01:15:09.857 --> 01:15:12.026
It would mean giving up
going anywhere else.

01:15:16.196 --> 01:15:17.614
This is where I would sit.

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:20.242
And I would never leave.

01:15:24.705 --> 01:15:26.248
What does he do your friend.

01:15:26.915 --> 01:15:29.460
How did he make the money to have this.

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:32.087
He writes essays.

01:15:32.588 --> 01:15:35.215
He writes essays and makes money
From essays.

01:15:35.549 --> 01:15:37.509
No stupid he’s a lawyer.

01:15:38.385 --> 01:15:39.803
He sues people.

01:15:40.429 --> 01:15:43.307
He gets up early in the morning
and he sues people.

01:15:45.267 --> 01:15:46.977
Was that a joke about the essays.

01:15:50.147 --> 01:15:52.399
I think I would have to spend
a night out here on my own

01:15:52.733 --> 01:15:53.984
to see how it feels.

01:15:54.777 --> 01:15:57.988
Maybe it’s too remote too beautiful

01:15:58.489 --> 01:16:00.157
too frightening in the dark.

01:16:25.766 --> 01:16:27.017
Could we change things now.

01:16:28.185 --> 01:16:30.437
- Change what.
- Change our lives.

01:16:31.396 --> 01:16:33.357
- Or decide that we should.
- No no.

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:35.150
Listen. Listen to me.

01:16:36.902 --> 01:16:38.112
I’m with someone

01:16:38.862 --> 01:16:39.757
but I would leave her.

01:16:39.787 --> 01:16:41.740
- Don’t say it.
- I would leave her this second.

01:16:44.076 --> 01:16:46.703
And then what move in with me
Take me to Berlin.

01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:50.040
Can’t we have a second chance We could
live together like we did then.

01:16:51.542 --> 01:16:53.168
We never lived together.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.422
You were always elsewhere
always on the move.

01:16:58.173 --> 01:16:59.633
Maybe we are wiser now.

01:17:02.386 --> 01:17:04.263
I won’t make that mistake again.

01:17:07.808 --> 01:17:09.977
You’re not wise at all are you.

01:17:12.896 --> 01:17:13.939
What do you mean.

01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:42.134
Tell me about you.

01:17:42.467 --> 01:17:43.635
Since we last met.

01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:45.637
Whatever. Tell me about your life.

01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:47.306
Leave me out of it.

01:17:48.056 --> 01:17:50.058
But how It will always be us.

01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.564
Not your work or your writing.

01:17:56.023 --> 01:17:57.316
No it’s you.

01:18:00.068 --> 01:18:01.528
Women.

01:18:02.404 --> 01:18:03.739
There will always be women.

01:18:04.364 --> 01:18:07.159
- Go on.
- It’s of no importance.

01:18:08.076 --> 01:18:10.495
I’m happy now. Happy to be here.

01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:12.456
Happy.

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:51.954
After we split up
or however you would call it.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.375
I met someone.

01:18:57.084 --> 01:18:59.378
Oh Someone you’re still seeing.

01:19:02.881 --> 01:19:06.260
Please don’t ask any questions.
Just let me talk.

01:19:07.135 --> 01:19:08.595
Then I won’t talk again.

01:19:09.763 --> 01:19:10.347
I was just...

01:19:10.377 --> 01:19:12.891
I’ve been waiting to see
you so I could tell you this.

01:19:14.643 --> 01:19:15.727
Maybe...

01:19:17.771 --> 01:19:20.357
Maybe you’re the only one
I needed to know this.

01:19:23.902 --> 01:19:26.363
I moved very close to him
I mean I lived with him

01:19:26.697 --> 01:19:29.449
and I thought that we would manage
our lives together but...

01:19:30.158 --> 01:19:32.536
natural and easy too

01:19:33.287 --> 01:19:34.329
happy.

01:19:35.372 --> 01:19:36.832
You’re still seeing him.

01:19:37.457 --> 01:19:38.709
He died.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.255
Marcus died.

01:19:48.218 --> 01:19:49.303
God...

01:19:53.557 --> 01:19:55.475
I can hardly say it still.

01:20:02.357 --> 01:20:03.775
What age was he.

01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:05.736
God he was young.

01:20:08.739 --> 01:20:10.073
It was a heart attack.

01:20:10.449 --> 01:20:12.284
He had it on the street.
He fell down dead.

01:20:12.701 --> 01:20:14.328
That is what happened.

01:20:16.371 --> 01:20:18.623
You know he died and I didn’t know

01:20:20.208 --> 01:20:21.752
or feel you know.

01:20:23.295 --> 01:20:24.838
He was in the same city.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:26.923
I didn’t feel...

01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:52.324
We lived on Bleecker Street.

01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:57.329
He had found his habitat

01:20:57.996 --> 01:21:02.250
and that was all he wanted me to
be there the chairs the desk the bed.

01:21:04.002 --> 01:21:05.045
He was a lawyer too.

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:09.716
He loved loopholes

01:21:10.175 --> 01:21:13.095
strange new ways
of looking at a contract like...

01:21:15.097 --> 01:21:18.850
the same way as he liked chess
and minimalist art and some jazz and...

01:21:20.685 --> 01:21:22.396
He had only one suit.

01:21:23.939 --> 01:21:26.483
Always wore
the same type of white shirt.

01:21:30.278 --> 01:21:32.781
I loved being with him
when he was asleep.

01:21:40.205 --> 01:21:44.042
He had a way of waking up
and then looking at you

01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:46.128
half apologizing.

01:21:51.383 --> 01:21:52.676
You’re shivering.

01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:03.979
I often feel in places like this
you know

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.232
the soft places the edge of things

01:22:08.775 --> 01:22:11.486
when it’s like this in the winter
that he might be here

01:22:13.113 --> 01:22:14.197
or come here.

01:22:14.531 --> 01:22:16.741
Like he came across the room to me
in that bar.

01:22:19.161 --> 01:22:21.455
And said nothing looked at me
and sipped his drink

01:22:21.788 --> 01:22:24.207
and made clear to me
that he wasn’t going to go.

01:22:30.672 --> 01:22:32.048
Is that why we came here.

01:22:32.591 --> 01:22:33.633
No.

01:22:34.551 --> 01:22:35.594
No.

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:38.555
It’s not why we came here but...

01:22:40.932 --> 01:22:43.059
I mean I needed to tell you
what happened

01:22:44.603 --> 01:22:45.937
no

01:22:46.271 --> 01:22:48.857
I know you thought
something else might happen.

01:22:50.734 --> 01:22:53.854
I could see when you were in that house
that you don’t just dream in your books

01:22:54.154 --> 01:22:57.949
you dream in your life.
But you cannot dream about me.

01:23:05.624 --> 01:23:06.750
But last night

01:23:09.252 --> 01:23:12.005
and this morning
I felt... You felt something too.

01:23:12.339 --> 01:23:13.840
Oh don’t tell me what I felt.

01:23:15.008 --> 01:23:16.008
But you’re free now.

01:23:16.426 --> 01:23:18.586
Free is not the word.
You’re alone.

01:23:18.616 --> 01:23:20.013
- But...
- But you...

01:23:21.556 --> 01:23:22.849
I am not free.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.314
- Is there someone else.
- No.

01:23:30.899 --> 01:23:32.275
I mean that’s what I’m...

01:23:33.276 --> 01:23:34.276
That’s what I’m saying.

01:23:45.288 --> 01:23:47.457
I went straight back to work
after he died.

01:23:47.999 --> 01:23:50.168
There was a case
and it couldn’t have been postponed

01:23:50.502 --> 01:23:52.128
and I was the only one briefed.

01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:53.964
Then I took on more work

01:23:54.673 --> 01:23:57.259
and then I got head hunted
which is a good way of putting it.

01:23:58.426 --> 01:24:01.555
Finally when I found that I
hadn’t stopped working for a year.

01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:03.807
I went to the therapist

01:24:04.349 --> 01:24:07.686
who was so frightened at the state
I was in that she sent me to a shrink

01:24:08.019 --> 01:24:09.019
like a real doctor.

01:24:10.814 --> 01:24:13.733
We tried talking
but I make a living from talking.

01:24:14.067 --> 01:24:15.485
I mean we tried medication.

01:24:16.528 --> 01:24:17.821
I didn’t take it.

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.408
In the end he used hypnosis on me.

01:24:23.326 --> 01:24:24.326
Have you ever done it.

01:24:25.745 --> 01:24:26.788
No.

01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:31.126
That is a shock.

01:24:35.797 --> 01:24:38.550
That is the biggest shock I’ve ever had
I mean Max...

01:24:42.887 --> 01:24:45.557
I went into Marcus’s mind
as he lay dying.

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:48.393
You know...

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.855
It was as though I was with him

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:53.690
you know and not beside him

01:24:54.024 --> 01:24:55.692
but in his mind too.

01:24:57.319 --> 01:25:01.698
It was as though he had taken me
with him or part of me or...

01:25:02.657 --> 01:25:05.744
and left the rest of me
what you see now you know I mean...

01:25:08.079 --> 01:25:09.289
I was with him.

01:25:10.665 --> 01:25:12.167
I felt what he felt.

01:25:14.586 --> 01:25:16.463
I died as he died.

01:25:16.796 --> 01:25:17.839
Max.

01:25:50.997 --> 01:25:54.334
You know the summer after you left
you sent me letters.

01:25:54.876 --> 01:25:56.378
You said you were traveling.

01:25:56.753 --> 01:25:57.962
I was really puzzled by that

01:25:58.296 --> 01:26:00.423
I thought you were taken up
by the new Berlin

01:26:01.591 --> 01:26:04.302
and then we had these talks
from your hotel rooms and...

01:26:04.928 --> 01:26:07.013
I never knew why
you weren’t in New York.

01:26:08.139 --> 01:26:10.308
You know
I wanted you to be in New York.

01:26:11.559 --> 01:26:14.688
I didn’t want you to be in Sienna
or in Florence or...

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.480
But you didn’t care.

01:26:17.482 --> 01:26:19.109
You were fooling around weren’t you.

01:26:19.693 --> 01:26:21.403
It wasn’t serious was it.

01:26:21.736 --> 01:26:24.572
It was just a story
you could tell years later no.

01:26:24.906 --> 01:26:26.783
Tell me that it’s true.
Please tell me.

01:26:27.242 --> 01:26:29.869
Tell me for once something that’s true
you know.

01:26:30.537 --> 01:26:33.039
Why didn’t you come back to New York.

01:26:33.957 --> 01:26:35.291
I was distracted.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.044
There was so much going on.
I was poor...

01:26:39.212 --> 01:26:41.423
- I let the year go by and...
- And.

01:26:49.848 --> 01:26:51.850
And there was someone on a book tour.

01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:54.269
She got pregnant.

01:26:58.982 --> 01:27:00.483
She wanted to keep the child

01:27:01.985 --> 01:27:03.027
a girl.

01:27:08.658 --> 01:27:11.745
- Do you see her.
- Of course I see her.

01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:13.455
I love her very much.

01:27:16.666 --> 01:27:17.792
And she’s how old.

01:27:19.002 --> 01:27:20.128
She’s 16 now.

01:27:21.713 --> 01:27:24.174
It happened
the first winter after I left.

01:27:27.844 --> 01:27:28.887
So...

01:27:31.389 --> 01:27:33.141
Why didn’t you ever tell me.

01:27:37.103 --> 01:27:38.646
I didn’t want to harm you.

01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:41.733
Oh...

01:27:42.692 --> 01:27:44.319
You know that's
what I liked about you.

01:27:44.736 --> 01:27:46.446
That you didn’t mean any harm.

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:48.948
You never meant any harm.

01:27:50.033 --> 01:27:51.367
Things just happened.

01:27:58.833 --> 01:28:00.502
I never knew what you saw in me.

01:28:03.630 --> 01:28:05.840
I wanted you to be
the father of my children.

01:28:34.369 --> 01:28:35.912
It’s been taken care of sir.

01:28:37.539 --> 01:28:38.623
Oh thank you.

01:30:44.582 --> 01:30:45.625
Hi, this is Clara

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.544
and if you love me, leave me a message.

01:31:00.932 --> 01:31:01.975
Hi, this is Clara

01:31:02.308 --> 01:31:04.727
and if you love me, leave me a message.

01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:31.879
Hey Lindsey it’s Max...

01:31:32.922 --> 01:31:34.841
Do you have Clara’s address.

01:32:31.355 --> 01:32:32.982
How long have you been living here.

01:32:33.316 --> 01:32:34.525
All the time.

01:32:38.696 --> 01:32:39.906
Over a kebab shop.

01:32:40.823 --> 01:32:42.909
That’s what I’ve been
smelling all the time

01:32:43.534 --> 01:32:44.702
Max don’t start.

01:32:47.705 --> 01:32:51.417
It’s in the pillows it’s all over the
bed. The sexy smell of cooking kebab.

01:32:51.751 --> 01:32:53.211
I didn’t want you to come here.

01:32:56.923 --> 01:32:58.243
I should have come the first day.

01:33:00.176 --> 01:33:01.469
I was careless.

01:33:03.012 --> 01:33:04.388
I’m sorry Clara.

01:33:06.057 --> 01:33:07.809
What I loved about you was...

01:33:10.853 --> 01:33:12.271
was that you knew so much.

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.899
I loved that you were older than me.

01:33:15.233 --> 01:33:16.275
I still do.

01:33:17.026 --> 01:33:18.694
I was happy when you suggested

01:33:19.028 --> 01:33:21.322
that I go to New York
and got me this job.

01:33:25.368 --> 01:33:28.746
But not once on the phone
did you ask me about my work.

01:33:29.247 --> 01:33:30.915
What exactly I’m doing here.

01:33:35.211 --> 01:33:38.339
I learned a lot of stuff: That the city
if you are alone is a dump

01:33:38.673 --> 01:33:40.424
your work everybody thinks you got it

01:33:40.758 --> 01:33:42.760
because your guy said
you were to have it.

01:33:44.512 --> 01:33:46.556
Was grateful for Roderick’s help.

01:33:47.598 --> 01:33:49.142
We had a lot of fun.

01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:53.312
He helped me survive the city.

01:33:53.646 --> 01:33:56.190
It’s fine in taxis moving from
one place to another

01:33:56.524 --> 01:33:59.152
it’s fine in hotels
it’s fine in a Woody Allen movie

01:33:59.485 --> 01:34:02.238
but try it on your own
on a Monday night in winter

01:34:02.572 --> 01:34:04.407
when the cold
is getting into your bones.

01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:06.951
And the man you love

01:34:07.326 --> 01:34:09.453
is 1000 miles away and does not care.

01:34:11.956 --> 01:34:13.207
Just try it once.

01:34:13.791 --> 01:34:15.251
Try it once.

01:34:15.918 --> 01:34:17.044
I’m sorry.

01:34:25.386 --> 01:34:26.971
I want you to tell me who you are

01:34:27.555 --> 01:34:28.973
and what you want from me.

01:34:29.432 --> 01:34:30.766
I want you to look at me.

01:34:31.601 --> 01:34:33.811
I look at you I see you Clara.

01:34:34.353 --> 01:34:35.438
I was jealous.

01:34:35.771 --> 01:34:37.023
Jealous.

01:34:37.648 --> 01:34:39.192
So you eloped with fucking Lindsey.

01:34:40.902 --> 01:34:43.154
I didn’t go to Montauk
with fucking Lindsey.

01:34:44.405 --> 01:34:45.406
You did not.

01:34:45.781 --> 01:34:48.201
No I didn’t go to Montauk
with fucking Lindsey.

01:34:54.624 --> 01:34:56.167
We’re going home.
I...

01:34:57.543 --> 01:34:59.045
I want you to come with me.

01:34:59.587 --> 01:35:01.964
Something really bad
must have happened to you.

01:35:04.634 --> 01:35:06.636
But I don’t want to know what it was.

01:35:09.096 --> 01:35:10.389
Let’s go tonight.

01:35:16.938 --> 01:35:19.732
Clara repeat what I’m saying
say after me:

01:35:21.108 --> 01:35:22.526
I’ve read all your books.

01:35:26.572 --> 01:35:27.615
Please.

01:35:30.284 --> 01:35:31.869
I’ve read all your books.

01:35:32.703 --> 01:35:34.497
No one except me will tolerate you.

01:35:35.081 --> 01:35:36.582
That’s just plain silly.

01:35:36.916 --> 01:35:38.292
Just say it.

01:35:43.965 --> 01:35:46.592
No one else except me
will tolerate you.

01:35:51.639 --> 01:35:54.267
You’re not gonna change
but I’m staying with you.

01:35:56.394 --> 01:35:57.478
I don’t know why.

01:36:00.231 --> 01:36:01.732
No not this one.

01:36:03.484 --> 01:36:04.527
Ah...

01:36:07.530 --> 01:36:11.117
Don’t contradict him. He likes women
to be sweet and agreeable.

01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:12.702
Sweet and agreeable.

01:36:13.035 --> 01:36:15.955
There’s a drawing
he promised me years ago a Paul Klee.

01:36:16.289 --> 01:36:18.291
It may get 300000 at an auction.

01:36:18.624 --> 01:36:20.876
Of course. Your pension fund.

01:36:21.252 --> 01:36:22.712
Sweet and agreeable.

01:36:25.089 --> 01:36:28.676
And there’s Malevich Kandinsky

01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:33.681
and somewhere we have Corot Klee
many things manuals and...

01:36:34.473 --> 01:36:36.642
Some are from my family of course.

01:36:40.479 --> 01:36:42.398
But now I wonder

01:36:42.732 --> 01:36:44.525
if I’m not tired of them.

01:36:45.318 --> 01:36:47.653
Which is why I don’t mind the light.

01:36:48.195 --> 01:36:49.363
You see the light.

01:36:53.909 --> 01:36:54.952
They fade

01:36:55.328 --> 01:36:56.370
you know.

01:36:56.704 --> 01:36:58.456
You’II see they fade...

01:37:00.082 --> 01:37:02.710
A little each year more in summer.

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:06.547
So why don’t you protect them.

01:37:09.258 --> 01:37:11.427
I could burn them. They are mine.

01:37:11.761 --> 01:37:13.095
I let them fade.

01:37:14.513 --> 01:37:15.973
They'll disappear when I do.

01:37:16.307 --> 01:37:18.225
I find that comforting.

01:37:20.936 --> 01:37:22.396
I think it’s disgusting.

01:37:22.855 --> 01:37:24.815
No I don’t think so.

01:37:25.483 --> 01:37:27.193
They are mine you understand

01:37:27.526 --> 01:37:30.654
- I own them.
- Bullshit No one can own them.

01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:34.367
My dear I think this
conversation will become...

01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:36.619
extremely boring.

01:37:37.787 --> 01:37:39.622
Why don’t you occupy Wall Street.

01:37:46.212 --> 01:37:47.212
Drink.

01:37:48.047 --> 01:37:49.173
Thank you.

01:37:52.676 --> 01:37:54.470
Now for the real reason

01:37:54.804 --> 01:37:57.139
I brought you here Max.

01:37:59.767 --> 01:38:00.851
Open it.

01:38:11.695 --> 01:38:13.489
I want you to have it.

01:38:14.907 --> 01:38:16.867
You remember Rebecca
was with us when I bought it.

01:38:21.747 --> 01:38:23.582
- You still see her.
- No.

01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:25.793
She works too much now.

01:38:26.502 --> 01:38:28.003
You.

01:38:29.213 --> 01:38:31.090
Go on take it.
Let that be an end to it.

01:38:32.425 --> 01:38:34.093
Take it Max.

01:38:35.136 --> 01:38:36.846
Before it fades away here.

01:39:04.832 --> 01:39:06.083
I hope to be back.

01:39:06.792 --> 01:39:08.711
Next year. Maybe sooner.

01:39:10.671 --> 01:39:11.714
Oh

01:39:12.673 --> 01:39:13.716
Your scarf.

01:39:15.259 --> 01:39:16.343
Keep it.

01:39:16.969 --> 01:39:18.012
Really.

01:39:19.847 --> 01:39:21.098
Thank you. Bye.

01:40:01.722 --> 01:40:03.974
I love you. You know that.

01:40:05.726 --> 01:40:08.479
I did... I did something very wrong.

01:40:08.812 --> 01:40:10.689
I feel I can tell you that.

01:40:14.568 --> 01:40:15.861
What happened in Montauk.

01:40:16.779 --> 01:40:19.323
I... I saw a ghost.

01:40:22.159 --> 01:40:23.494
Did you fuck her.

01:40:26.539 --> 01:40:28.082
It wasn’t about sex.

01:40:30.042 --> 01:40:31.418
Maybe it was.

01:40:33.212 --> 01:40:34.755
You can’t fuck a ghost.
