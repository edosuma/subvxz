WEBVTT

00:00.349 --> 00:01.683
<i>Previously on 30 Rock...</i>

00:02.355 --> 00:03.524
- So you're...
- In three weddings

00:03.591 --> 00:04.857
On the same day, yeah.

00:04.925 --> 00:06.960
Fate is telling us
we're each other's

00:07.027 --> 00:08.432
Settling soul mates.

00:08.499 --> 00:09.867
I've been seeing someone else,

00:09.935 --> 00:11.465
And I think I'm in love
with both of you.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.833
Jack wants me to stall?

00:15.270 --> 00:17.539
So I'm gonna marry...

00:17.606 --> 00:20.142
Japheth.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.915
And we're gonna live in...

00:22.982 --> 00:24.984
Nineveh.

00:25.051 --> 00:27.986
And I'm gonna be a...

00:28.054 --> 00:29.320
Prostitute.

00:29.387 --> 00:31.189
Yes, I continued
to see other people.

00:31.257 --> 00:33.895
One person, who apparently
you're also in love with.

00:33.963 --> 00:36.297
<i>It's possible. Haven't you
ever read Archie comics?</i>

00:36.364 --> 00:38.733
Jack, I got divorced.

00:38.801 --> 00:40.870
I didn't know
if you would ever leave mark,

00:40.937 --> 00:43.807
So I let myself
fall into something else.

00:43.875 --> 00:45.442
You look amazing in that dress.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.679
You look like a gay mortician
in that suit.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.986
You know, Kenneth,
I have a thankless job.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.721
For example,
I'm here on a Saturday

00:54.789 --> 00:56.190
To show around
some Kabletown folks.

00:56.258 --> 00:57.892
Chk-chk! Boom!

00:57.960 --> 00:59.393
It's not real.

00:59.461 --> 01:02.830
Point is, I usually only get
to deliver bad news.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.031
But not today.

01:04.099 --> 01:08.102
Kenneth, you are the new...

01:08.170 --> 01:12.541
Junior in-charge boy
of the entire NBC page program.

01:12.608 --> 01:14.542
Oh, my goodness!

01:14.610 --> 01:16.577
This is my dream come true.

01:16.645 --> 01:20.180
And to hear it from my best
friend in the whole world,

01:20.247 --> 01:22.148
Comma, bald category.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.949
Well, you start in two weeks.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.351
And they'll give you some moving
money to help you get to L.A.

01:26.418 --> 01:28.419
California?

01:28.487 --> 01:30.154
I can't move out there

01:30.222 --> 01:31.721
And be away from all of you.

01:31.789 --> 01:33.857
No, thank you, sir.
I'll pass.

01:33.924 --> 01:36.526
You can't pass.
Jack put you up for this.

01:36.594 --> 01:38.028
If you don't want the job,
you have to talk to him.

01:38.096 --> 01:39.964
Fine.
I will talk to him.

01:40.032 --> 01:41.966
And Mr. Donaghy
will understand

01:42.034 --> 01:43.702
'cause he's my best friend
in the whole world,

01:57.817 --> 01:59.151
I want to take naps with you.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.853
I want to watch you

02:00.921 --> 02:04.290

03:17.096 --> 03:18.229
I thought you were going to get

03:18.297 --> 03:19.263
Your hair done
for your friend's wedding.

03:19.331 --> 03:21.332
I was, but I forgot
my bag of hair.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.967

Oh, spare me your lame excuses.

03:30.974 --> 03:32.508
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,

03:32.575 --> 03:34.576
But when a girl dates
a straight man

03:34.644 --> 03:37.779
Who impersonates her on stage
for mostly gay audiences,

03:37.847 --> 03:39.515
She has certain expectations.

03:39.583 --> 03:40.917
Fidelity, Paul.

03:40.984 --> 03:42.618
It's not just the name
of a bank that sued me.

03:42.686 --> 03:44.753
But I love you both equally.

03:44.821 --> 03:46.521
I don't know what to tell you.

03:46.589 --> 03:47.723
But you have to choose.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.926
It's her or me.

03:50.994 --> 03:52.528
Jenna, babe, wait.

03:52.595 --> 03:53.529
I'm sorry.

03:53.596 --> 03:57.432
That came out wrong.

04:03.638 --> 04:04.705
Mr. Donaghy!

04:04.773 --> 04:06.206
- Oh, God, Kenneth!
- I need to talk to you

04:06.274 --> 04:07.841
About an urgent
page-related matter.

04:07.909 --> 04:08.842
God, he came out of nowhere.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.244
We can talk on Monday.

04:10.311 --> 04:12.479
Ms. Donovan and I have an hour
between weddings to, uh--

04:12.547 --> 04:14.114
- Tickle each other
like teletubbies.

04:14.182 --> 04:15.649
That's how I used to explain it
to my kids

04:15.717 --> 04:17.451
When they walked in on us.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.053
But I don't want
my promotion, sir.

04:20.122 --> 04:22.656
I want to stay here in New York
with all my friends.

04:22.724 --> 04:24.459
I'm not going
to let you say no, Kenneth.

04:24.526 --> 04:25.727
This is a promotion for you.

04:25.795 --> 04:26.895
And, yes, it's difficult,

04:26.963 --> 04:28.730
But today
is about pulling triggers.

04:28.798 --> 04:29.965
It's about making bold choices.

04:30.033 --> 04:32.133
It's about--
- Two spider-mans fighting,

04:32.201 --> 04:33.301
And sometimes
they make weird noises,

04:33.369 --> 04:35.337
But they're not hurting
each other.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.405
How often
did they walk in on you?

04:36.473 --> 04:37.506
A lot.

04:37.574 --> 04:39.408
If you'll excuse me.

04:44.147 --> 04:46.381
D'oh, bother!
Treble bother!

04:46.449 --> 04:47.516
What is it?

04:47.584 --> 04:48.750
My fancy dress slippers.

04:48.818 --> 04:50.118
I left them in my office.

04:50.186 --> 04:52.020
So go get them and meet me
at Cerie's wedding.

04:52.088 --> 04:53.756
No.
When I was fired,

04:53.823 --> 04:54.957
I vowed on the snipes name

04:55.025 --> 04:56.859
I would never set foot
in there again.

04:56.927 --> 04:59.062
Also Kevin in security
has a picture of me.

04:59.129 --> 05:01.932
So, what, you want me
to go get your tuxedo shoes?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.568
See?
Our minds are already one

05:04.636 --> 05:05.770
As our bodies soon shall be.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.106
There's the address.

05:08.173 --> 05:10.041
Of course.
You work in insurance.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.311
Specializing
in the transportation industry.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.714
Fulfills my boyhood passion
for train accidents.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.149
Fine.
I'll go get your shoes.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.917
Farewell, my luscious plum.

05:23.221 --> 05:24.355
- Oh, son of a--

05:24.423 --> 05:26.023
- Why is your face like that?

05:29.594 --> 05:31.962
California?
No way, Ken.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.830
Look, you got
to tank this promotion.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.832
Do a sloppy job,
and they'll leave you alone.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.903
That's how I got out of doing
foreplay with Angie.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.370
And my taxes.

05:41.438 --> 05:43.372
That's not in my nature.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.542
If you've learned anything
from me,

05:46.610 --> 05:48.177
It's how to do a bad job.

05:48.245 --> 05:49.745
Go. Honor me.

05:49.813 --> 05:51.013
Save yourself.

05:51.081 --> 05:52.648
But first get me a sandwich.

05:52.715 --> 05:56.285
Get it yourself, Chubbs.
I'm on a coffee break.

goof-around weddings

06:11.003 --> 06:14.239

06:21.648 --> 06:23.014
Well, it's all true.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.116
I'm a native of Houston,
and I love to cook healthy.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.085

impersonator stuff.

06:27.152 --> 06:28.886
Oh, sure.
Of course.

06:28.954 --> 06:32.824
It's actually been causing
some problems at home lately.

06:32.891 --> 06:35.626
Do you think it's possible
to love two women at once?

06:35.694 --> 06:38.395
I know it's possible.

06:38.463 --> 06:40.798
But at some point,
you have to choose, Paul.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.433
You can't delude yourself
with thoughts like,

06:42.501 --> 06:46.371
"what if I could somehow combine
them into one perfect woman,

06:46.439 --> 06:48.740
Like a s'more you could take
a shower with?"

06:48.808 --> 06:50.809
But how do you know if you've
made the right decision?

06:50.876 --> 06:52.578
You don't.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.313
You'll always be wondering

06:54.380 --> 06:56.515
What your life
would have been like

06:56.583 --> 06:57.950
If you'd opened
that other door.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.618
Like at a haunted house
sex party.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.786
Exactly.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.355
Thank you, Jack.

07:07.061 --> 07:09.662
Come on, Jessup.
Get it together. No tears.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.565
Everything all right in there?

07:14.435 --> 07:17.304
I'm fine.
Thank you.

07:17.372 --> 07:20.073
Here.
You need this more than I do.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.942
I never put my mouth on it.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.179
- Thanks.
- You look so familiar to me.

07:25.247 --> 07:28.115
Oh, I'm a financial reporter
for CNBC.

07:28.183 --> 07:30.518
<i>The hot box

07:30.586 --> 07:33.321
No. You ever do a commercial
for overshoppe.com?

07:33.389 --> 07:34.689
Oh, God, I did.

07:34.757 --> 07:37.525
Oh, that was before I got rid
of my Maryland accent.

07:37.592 --> 07:40.961
Does the "o" have it?
"o," we do.

07:41.029 --> 07:43.330
Do you "o"?
"o," no?

07:43.398 --> 07:45.365
Let go.
"o."

07:45.433 --> 07:47.967
Ugh.
That accent's idiotic.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.470
Anyway, nice to meet you,
Avery Jessup.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.604
I'm Nancy.
Hi.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.874
I'm not normally
this--ahem--overwhelmed.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.043
I-I came here
to talk to my boyfriend

07:57.111 --> 07:58.378
Or whatever he is.

07:58.446 --> 08:00.047
I mean,
this whole situation--

08:00.114 --> 08:02.750
Clamp down, Jessup!
Be a winner.

08:04.286 --> 08:05.853
Oh, my God.

08:05.921 --> 08:07.922
I can't drink this.

08:11.627 --> 08:13.929
You wanna talk about it?

08:15.431 --> 08:19.067
Oh, tuxedo slippers.
Give me a break.

08:19.134 --> 08:20.468
Excuse me.

08:20.536 --> 08:21.903
I'm supposed to meet you here?

08:21.970 --> 08:23.337
Huh?

08:23.405 --> 08:25.338
Are you Wesley?
I'm Carol.

08:25.406 --> 08:26.706
I'm sorry.
What's happening now?

08:26.774 --> 08:27.874
I'm supposed to meet a Wesley

08:27.942 --> 08:28.975
About my insurance claim.

08:29.043 --> 08:30.376
Wesley doesn't work here
anymore.

08:30.444 --> 08:31.378
Are you serious?

08:31.445 --> 08:32.679
I mean, I made the appointment,

08:32.746 --> 08:34.580
Like, a month ago.
I rearranged my whole Saturday.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.148
Are you a doorman?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.818
Yeah, I'm a doorman...
To the sky.

08:38.885 --> 08:39.852
I'm a pilot.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.688
Oh, okay.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.090
Well, look, it's a pretty
standard workman's comp claim.

08:44.158 --> 08:45.692
I'm sure you could handle it.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.194
I was flying at 7:00 A.M.
From Tampa to Louisville,

08:48.262 --> 08:49.529
And we had
a two-hour weather delay,

08:49.597 --> 08:51.431
So naturally
all the passengers got drunk.

08:51.499 --> 08:52.932
Generally speaking,
if there's a delay

08:53.000 --> 08:55.534
Of more than 20 minutes, I might
as well be driving a party bus.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.736
It's just idiocy.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.138
I don't know what's going on
in this country.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.840
- I know. People wear flip-flops
to church.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.376
And the NBA tattoo situation
is out of control.

09:04.443 --> 09:07.212
Thank you. Anyway, we're about
a half hour into the flight,

09:07.279 --> 09:09.913
I hear this commotion
behind me in the cabin,

09:09.981 --> 09:11.381
So I exit the cockpit,
I go down the aisle,

09:11.449 --> 09:12.716
And to my left, I see--

09:12.784 --> 09:14.084
A terrorist?

09:14.152 --> 09:15.786
No. I wish.
It's a drunk lady.

09:15.853 --> 09:17.955
She's pulled her pants off,
and she's ranting.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.657
She's complaining about
the in-flight entertainment.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.860
So things got
a little heated...

09:21.927 --> 09:24.363
And I had to implement sky law.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.898
- What's...
- Sky law.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.134
It's when I put on
the "fasten seatbelt" sign,

09:28.201 --> 09:29.335
And no one's allowed to move

09:29.403 --> 09:31.471
Till we've had ten minutes
of silence.

09:31.539 --> 09:32.706
I made the whole thing up.

09:32.774 --> 09:33.974
But, you know,
people are stupid,

09:34.042 --> 09:35.442
So they don't question it.

09:35.510 --> 09:37.144
That is awesome.

09:37.212 --> 09:40.214
So what is the workman's comp
part of this?

09:40.282 --> 09:41.682
Eventually, I flipped
the drunk lady off,

09:41.750 --> 09:43.217
She bit my finger.

09:43.285 --> 09:44.719
I know.
It was totally unprofessional.

09:44.787 --> 09:47.355
<i>But she was bagging pretty hard
on my TGS.</i>

09:47.423 --> 09:48.990
<i>- What?
- TGS.</i>

09:49.058 --> 09:51.160
It's this late-night show
on NBC.

09:51.228 --> 09:53.562
We run it in-flight
when we're northwest-bound.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.164
Basically, the greatest thing
ever on television.

09:55.232 --> 09:58.901
I don't stand for anybody
besmirching it on my aircraft.

09:58.969 --> 10:01.137
Do you believe in fate?

10:04.508 --> 10:05.574
Wait a minute.
Are you kidding me?

10:05.642 --> 10:06.676
<i>You write
for TGS with Tracy Jordan?</i>

10:07.243 --> 10:08.344
I'm the head writer.

10:08.411 --> 10:09.979
I'm not
an insurance claims adjustor.

10:10.046 --> 10:13.549
I'm just here
because my cousin...

10:15.886 --> 10:17.653
Well, I mean,
it's my favorite show ever.

10:17.721 --> 10:20.323
There's
the one fart doctor sketch

10:20.391 --> 10:22.291
Where this fart doctor's trying
to figure out who farted

10:22.358 --> 10:23.959
In the spelling bee,
and he's like...

10:24.027 --> 10:25.594
"he who spelt it,
dealt it."

10:25.662 --> 10:27.629
I wrote that.
I write all of the fart doctors.

10:27.697 --> 10:29.464
I can't believe this.

10:31.467 --> 10:33.401
Would you like to go to
a rich girl's wedding with me?

10:33.469 --> 10:35.269
I don't know.
Does that sound like more fun

10:35.337 --> 10:37.238
Than me eating alone
at the Laguardia chili's?

10:39.241 --> 10:40.741
I won't leave you, sir.

10:40.809 --> 10:42.543
No matter what it takes.

10:43.978 --> 10:47.046
Good afternoon,
and welcome...Not.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.848
We begin our stupid tour

10:48.916 --> 10:50.550
Of this once-great network

10:50.618 --> 10:52.819
Outside studio 6h.

10:52.887 --> 10:54.888
Uh-oh. Ring-ring.

10:54.956 --> 10:57.558
Hmm.
What's up?

10:57.626 --> 11:02.096
Nothing. Just giving a dumb tour
to a bunch of uggos.

11:02.164 --> 11:03.398
Let's meet up later

11:03.465 --> 11:05.467
And smoke some drug cigarettes.

11:09.006 --> 11:10.073
You're a pilot, huh?

11:10.141 --> 11:12.275
I should pick your brain.

11:12.343 --> 11:14.678
I'm developing a daytime talk
show with Sully Sullenberger.

11:14.746 --> 11:15.713
Yeah, I met that guy.

11:15.781 --> 11:17.215
He's not that great.

11:17.282 --> 11:18.650
You know what a great pilot
would have done?

11:18.717 --> 11:20.285
Not hit the birds.

11:20.353 --> 11:22.354
That's what I do every day--
not hit birds.

11:22.421 --> 11:23.555
Where's my ticket
to the Grammys?

11:23.622 --> 11:25.957
Hey, what took you so long
in the bathroom?

11:26.025 --> 11:28.393
The usual ladies' room
nonsense.

11:28.461 --> 11:29.394
Girl with boyfriend troubles.

11:29.462 --> 11:30.629
Someone forgot tampons.

11:30.697 --> 11:32.464
Everybody's bad
at science and math.

11:32.532 --> 11:34.233
You know the drill.

11:34.301 --> 11:35.901
The ceremony
will be starting soon.

11:35.969 --> 11:37.369
I'll get our table number.

11:37.437 --> 11:39.638
You get as many drinks
as you can carry.

11:39.706 --> 11:41.139
I'll see you
at the reception, Liz.

11:41.207 --> 11:43.275
Jack.
Carol.

11:43.342 --> 11:47.746
Get ready for some of this.

11:47.814 --> 11:49.247
Later.

11:49.315 --> 11:50.482
He's here with you?

11:50.549 --> 11:51.516
Indeed he is.

11:51.584 --> 11:53.285
I see that Nancy is still here.

11:53.352 --> 11:55.220
You're welcome.

11:55.288 --> 11:57.589
- Smug 40-year-old bridesmaid.
What a treat for everyone.

11:57.657 --> 11:59.958
Yes, Lemon,
I am with Nancy now.

12:00.026 --> 12:01.026
What made up your mind?

12:01.094 --> 12:02.727
Well, I decided
that any decision

12:02.795 --> 12:04.396
Was better
than no decision at all.

12:04.464 --> 12:05.530
Huh.
I don't know, Jack.

12:05.598 --> 12:07.466
I used to feel that way too,
but now I know.

12:07.534 --> 12:09.068
You can't force your fate.

12:09.136 --> 12:11.069
You just have
to let it wash over you,

12:11.137 --> 12:13.806
Like a spray tan that won't take
because your skin is too oily.

12:13.874 --> 12:15.041
That's absurd, Lemon.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.409
The world is made
by those who control

12:16.476 --> 12:17.643
Their own destiny.

12:17.711 --> 12:19.378
It isn't made by those
who don't do.

12:19.446 --> 12:21.113
It's made by those who do do,

12:21.181 --> 12:22.882
Which is what made me
the man I am.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.251
I do do.

12:24.318 --> 12:25.352
Yeah.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.020
Grow up, Lemon.

12:27.088 --> 12:29.423
The point is I made my choice,
and I'm not looking back.

12:29.490 --> 12:30.691
Period.
Period.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.267
Avery Jessup?

12:39.335 --> 12:40.435
Son of a--

12:41.605 --> 12:42.605
What did you do
on your tour today?

12:42.673 --> 12:44.306
Those were
the Kabletown executives.

12:44.374 --> 12:45.541
Our new bosses.

12:45.608 --> 12:47.876
Sir, I was just trying
to do a bad job

12:47.944 --> 12:50.279
So I wouldn't have
to go to Los Angeles.

12:50.347 --> 12:52.415
Everyone there smiles creepily
all the time.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.183
And that's sort of my thing.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.351
Kenneth, you're not going

12:55.418 --> 12:57.486
To Los Angeles.
Oh.

12:57.554 --> 12:59.722
Because they're making me
fire you.

12:59.789 --> 13:02.057
You're fired.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:22.242 --> 13:23.409
Ready?

13:23.476 --> 13:25.244
Here.
This is yours.

13:25.312 --> 13:27.146
Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry.

13:27.214 --> 13:29.381
This is
an embarrassing oversight.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.683
Jack, this morning at church,

13:30.751 --> 13:32.484
You told me all the reasons
that you loved me,

13:32.552 --> 13:33.719
Some more graphic

13:33.787 --> 13:35.087
Than were appropriate
for the setting.

13:35.155 --> 13:36.689
Now I want you to tell me

13:36.757 --> 13:39.191
What's so special
about this other woman.

13:39.259 --> 13:41.794
Well, I like
how she's less hot than you.

13:41.862 --> 13:42.995
I'm serious.

13:43.063 --> 13:44.130
What can I say?

13:44.198 --> 13:46.233
She's smart.
She's pretty.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.469
She can tell you the Dow 40
in order of market cap.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.838
She knows how
to field dress a deer.

13:50.905 --> 13:51.939
Why do you--
- Go on.

13:52.007 --> 13:54.675
Okay.

13:54.743 --> 13:58.212
Her laugh is like music.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.446
Really mean music.

13:59.514 --> 14:00.981
And she always wears high heels

14:01.049 --> 14:04.351
Because, according to her,
flat shoes are for quitters.

14:04.419 --> 14:06.653
For God's sake, what can I say?

14:06.721 --> 14:08.188
You'd like her.
So you weren't lying

14:08.256 --> 14:09.589
When you said
you were in love with two women?

14:09.657 --> 14:11.758
- No. I wasn't lying.
- Good.

14:11.826 --> 14:13.526
Then I feel a lot better
about leaving.

14:13.594 --> 14:15.762
- What?
- Avery's here, Jack.

14:18.632 --> 14:20.633
And she's pregnant.

14:20.701 --> 14:22.802
Oh, my God.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.437
This is crazy.

14:24.505 --> 14:25.872
Ah, it's fate.

14:25.939 --> 14:27.406
You were supposed to be a dad.

14:27.474 --> 14:30.110
And by the way, when I blew
your mind last night,

14:30.177 --> 14:35.215
I was giving it about 50%.

14:35.282 --> 14:36.950
Unhand my fiancee!

14:37.018 --> 14:39.319
No, no, he's just a groomsman.

14:39.387 --> 14:41.622
And a Somali pirate.
Careful.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.023
You tried to end our engagement

14:43.091 --> 14:45.359
With a textual transmission.

14:46.962 --> 14:48.462
Your behavior as a fiancee

14:48.529 --> 14:51.565
Has been as weak
as American tea.

14:51.632 --> 14:52.665
There. I've said it.

14:52.733 --> 14:55.501
Our first argument, everyone.

14:55.569 --> 14:57.402
You're engaged?

14:57.470 --> 14:59.804
What if the bachelorette party
theme was sluts?

14:59.872 --> 15:01.906
No, the engagement is off.

15:01.974 --> 15:05.309
You keep talking about how fate
is trying to push us together.

15:05.377 --> 15:07.846
You know what, it is.
But not to meet you.

15:07.913 --> 15:09.480
To meet the right man.

15:09.548 --> 15:11.148
His name is Carol.

15:11.216 --> 15:13.084
Like Carroll O'Connor
from Nick at nite.

15:13.151 --> 15:14.618
Exactly, Cerie.
Thank you.

15:14.686 --> 15:17.588
Carol is the one
that I was fated to meet.

15:17.656 --> 15:19.757
And, yeah, I've only known him
for a few hours,

15:19.825 --> 15:20.992
And maybe this sounds crazy,

15:21.059 --> 15:22.760
But I already feel
like I could spend

15:22.828 --> 15:24.295
The rest of my life with him.

15:24.363 --> 15:27.332
He's the one
that I've been waiting for.

15:27.399 --> 15:31.135
And someday, when Carol sees
my disgusting foot secret,

15:31.203 --> 15:32.937
He's gonna be okay with it.

15:33.004 --> 15:34.171
I can tell.

15:34.239 --> 15:36.140
You were wrong, Wesley.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.275
We don't have to settle.

15:37.342 --> 15:38.743
The moms were wrong.

15:38.811 --> 15:41.079
Stupid buzz Aldrin was wrong.

15:41.147 --> 15:43.748
So thank you
and good-bye.

15:43.816 --> 15:47.352
Praise to the universe.
Love is real!

15:48.989 --> 15:50.522
Fine.

15:50.590 --> 15:52.458
It's your loss.

15:52.525 --> 15:55.061
There's only one Wesley snipes
in this world.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.896
You know there isn't.

16:02.270 --> 16:03.537
How much of that did you hear?

16:03.605 --> 16:05.105
Well, you were engaged.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.206
Apparently
you hate buzz Aldrin.

16:06.274 --> 16:07.874
Foot problem.

16:07.942 --> 16:09.342
And you and I are going
to spend

16:09.410 --> 16:10.543
The rest of our lives together.

16:10.611 --> 16:12.211
I see.

16:12.279 --> 16:14.813
I'm sure you could
get a cab on Houston.

16:14.881 --> 16:17.282
Yeah, I'm gonna depart.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.050
On time.

16:19.118 --> 16:21.319
I'm a pilot.

16:27.192 --> 16:28.392
Jack.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.927

16:51.681 --> 16:53.615
Mazel Tov.

16:53.683 --> 16:56.485
I'm trying to tell you
I want to get married.

16:56.552 --> 16:58.019
Oh, for God's sakes, Jack.

16:58.087 --> 17:00.255
What do you think, you're just
gonna sweep me off my feet?

17:00.322 --> 17:03.190
This pregnancy is two years
ahead of schedule.

17:03.258 --> 17:04.759
I'm suing dodecacil.

17:04.826 --> 17:06.728
I'm suing you.
I'm suing this baby.

17:06.795 --> 17:08.262
You can't control everything,
Avery.

17:08.330 --> 17:09.464
Sometimes it's just fate.

17:09.531 --> 17:11.900
Ugh. Is their gay juice
in the champagne?

17:11.968 --> 17:13.835
See.
I want you to teach our child

17:13.903 --> 17:15.537
How to say awesome stuff
like that.

17:15.605 --> 17:18.141
- I would be a kick-ass mom.

17:18.209 --> 17:20.877
But if this is just you
trying to do the right thing--

17:20.944 --> 17:22.612
- No. I want this.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.781
I've always wanted this.

17:24.848 --> 17:26.116
But maybe it's too hard.

17:26.184 --> 17:28.218
The career, motherhood,

17:28.286 --> 17:29.586
Keeping it tight

17:29.654 --> 17:30.954
To stay camera-ready
for breaking news.

17:31.022 --> 17:32.990
I mean, sure,
Soledad O'Brien does it, but--

17:33.057 --> 17:34.891
- I wipe the floor
with that bitch.

17:37.128 --> 17:40.263
Let's do this.

17:40.331 --> 17:42.132
Love is patient.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.734
Love is weird
and sometimes gross.

17:44.802 --> 17:47.804
Love is elusive,
and you have found it.

17:47.872 --> 17:49.139
So treasure it.

17:49.206 --> 17:50.674
To Grizz and Feyonce.

17:53.578 --> 17:55.680
On behalf of Grizz and Feyonce,

17:55.747 --> 17:56.981
I'd like to thank Jack Donaghy

17:57.049 --> 17:59.684
For letting us have
this reception here

17:59.752 --> 18:02.220
After the other location
couldn't support the weight

18:02.288 --> 18:04.822
Of Grizz's extended family.

18:11.763 --> 18:13.197
Naturally, I blew it.

18:13.264 --> 18:15.298
Now I'm alone in a dashiki.

18:15.366 --> 18:17.734
I wonder what
that Somali pirate's deal is.

18:17.802 --> 18:18.802
I could live on a boat.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.871
I don't even know
where Paul went.

18:20.938 --> 18:22.272
I guess he made his choice.

18:22.339 --> 18:23.740
You know what?
Forget men.

18:23.807 --> 18:24.774
We've got each other.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.809
Yeah. Let's go lez.

18:26.877 --> 18:29.011
No, I meant, like,
a book club or something. Jeez.

18:29.079 --> 18:30.714
Right. Sisterhood.

18:30.781 --> 18:32.549
That's something
we can count on.

18:32.617 --> 18:34.017
I'll never--
is that Paul?

18:36.454 --> 18:38.221
- You have a lot
of taped-up balls

18:38.289 --> 18:40.490
To come here dressed like that.

18:40.558 --> 18:41.624
Oh, my God.

18:41.692 --> 18:43.259
If this is gonna work, Jenna,

18:43.327 --> 18:44.727
It can't just be all about you.

18:44.795 --> 18:46.762
- But...
- No buts.

18:46.830 --> 18:49.031
I'm the man here,
and you're gonna respect me.

18:49.099 --> 18:53.069
Yes, shma'am.

18:55.706 --> 18:59.042
Lemon, you know that's
a young boy's puberty dashiki.

18:59.110 --> 19:01.311
Wrong, Jack. It's
a warlord's concubine dashiki.

19:01.378 --> 19:03.146
Avery, you're here.

19:03.214 --> 19:04.914
I'm not surprised.
Why should I be?

19:04.982 --> 19:06.349
And I'm pregnant.

19:06.416 --> 19:10.053
Also not shocking me.
Reacting appropriately.

19:10.121 --> 19:11.921
Lemon, I think your pilot
friend is looking for you.

19:14.658 --> 19:17.126
So?

19:17.194 --> 19:18.727
I thought he was gone forever.

19:18.795 --> 19:20.763
I guess
I should go talk to him.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.433
Carol, what are you doing here?

19:24.501 --> 19:25.935
How did you get past security?

19:26.002 --> 19:27.403
You walk briskly
in a pilot's uniform,

19:27.470 --> 19:28.737
You can go
pretty much anywhere.

19:28.805 --> 19:29.972
I've been upstairs
in the white house

19:30.039 --> 19:31.106
While the obamas were sleeping.

19:31.174 --> 19:33.108
I thought you had a flight.

19:33.175 --> 19:35.309
Yeah, I do.
Those dirt bags can wait

19:35.377 --> 19:36.444
On the runway
a couple more hours.

19:36.512 --> 19:39.079
I hate people too.

19:39.147 --> 19:41.281
Look, I'm 39 years old,
I'm single,

19:41.349 --> 19:44.217
And lately I've been thinking
there's a reason for that.

19:44.285 --> 19:45.318
I keep expecting people
to be perfect,

19:45.386 --> 19:47.521
But nobody's perfect.
Yes. Exactly.

19:47.589 --> 19:48.722
So if the worst thing about you

19:48.790 --> 19:51.059
Is that you give
crazy speeches to fiances

19:51.126 --> 19:53.394
And maybe you have
some kind of foot thing...

19:53.462 --> 19:55.063
That was a joke.
I have medicine for it.

19:55.130 --> 19:56.497
Why don't we give this a shot?

19:56.565 --> 19:59.267
As long as you're not Jewish.
I'm totally kidding.

19:59.635 --> 20:00.935
Yes.
Let's do this.

20:01.003 --> 20:04.605
And honestly, Carol,
I am a very normal person.

20:04.673 --> 20:05.739
Not a good time, guys.

20:05.807 --> 20:08.008
Liz, Cher and me,

20:08.076 --> 20:10.043
Paul, and I want to thank you
for being a part

20:10.111 --> 20:11.211
Of our lives.

20:11.279 --> 20:13.681
And for encouraging us
to be like this.

20:13.748 --> 20:15.015
I can't believe I'm meeting

20:15.083 --> 20:17.151
1 1/2 Jenna Maroneys right now.

20:17.219 --> 20:18.386
Hi. Hi, there.
Hi.

20:18.453 --> 20:20.221
- Carol.
- Carol. That's a girl's name.

20:20.289 --> 20:21.322
It's a family name.

20:22.591 --> 20:23.924
Hey, everybody.

20:23.992 --> 20:26.460
I got fired today.

20:26.528 --> 20:30.364
You won't have Kenneth Ellen Parcell
to kick around anymore,

20:30.432 --> 20:33.534
So I want to tell you people

20:33.602 --> 20:35.770
What I really think of you.

20:35.837 --> 20:37.938
- Hey, this ain't the--
- No. No.

20:38.006 --> 20:43.076
For four long years, I have
listened to you all complain

20:43.144 --> 20:48.082
About your East coast
media elite problems,

20:48.149 --> 20:50.017
Your apartment renovations,

20:50.085 --> 20:54.122
<i>And your overpriced
star wars memorabilia.</i>

20:54.190 --> 20:55.591
That doorman is hammered.

20:55.658 --> 20:56.992
I have watched you

20:57.060 --> 21:00.229
Throw away better food

21:00.297 --> 21:04.167
Than my family eats
at Christmas.

21:04.235 --> 21:08.471
And I have loved it.

21:08.539 --> 21:11.742
You people,
you are my best friends,

21:11.809 --> 21:14.345
And I hope you get everything

21:14.412 --> 21:17.114
You want in life.

21:18.182 --> 21:21.185
Kenneth!

21:21.253 --> 21:23.653
So kiss my face!

21:23.721 --> 21:25.288
That was actually really sweet.

21:25.356 --> 21:28.058
I'll see you all in heaven!

21:31.594 --> 21:33.329
Have a wonderful summer!

21:33.330 --> 21:43.330
