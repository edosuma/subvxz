<i>After I killed them, I
dropped the gun in the Thames,</i>

01:01.795 --> 01:04.992
<i>washed the residue off me hands
in the bathroom of a Burger King,</i>

01:05.065 --> 01:07.693
<i>and walked home
to await instructions.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:11.932
<i>Shortly thereafter, the
instructions came through.</i>

01:12.439 --> 01:15.772
<i>"Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks.</i>

01:15.842 --> 01:17.434
<i>"Get to Bruges."</i>

01:19.012 --> 01:21.913
<i>I didn't even know
where Bruges fucking was.</i>

01:25.952 --> 01:27.544
<i>It's in Belgium.</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:32.246
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

01:32.325 --> 01:33.690
<i>Bruges is
not a shithole.</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:34.784
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

01:34.861 --> 01:36.852
<i>Ray, we've only just got
off the fucking train.</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:39.831
<i>Could we reserve judgment on Bruges
until we've seen the fucking place?</i>

01:39.899 --> 01:41.457
<i>I know it's gonna be
a shithole.</i>

02:09.929 --> 02:11.191
Shithole.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.970
I think you have a couple of rooms
booked under Cranham and Blakely?

02:21.040 --> 02:24.237
Yes. No, we have
one room booked.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.346
One twin room.
Booked for two weeks.

02:28.214 --> 02:29.579
Two weeks!

02:30.250 --> 02:31.376
Do you have
another room?

02:31.451 --> 02:33.009
No, I'm afraid
we're fully booked.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.021
With Christmas,
everywhere is fully booked.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.116
Okay.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.063
It's very pretty.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.655
I'm not being funny,
we can't stay here.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.633
We've got to stay here
until he rings.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.066
Well, what if he doesn't
ring for two weeks?

02:50.136 --> 02:51.763
Then we stay here
for two weeks.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.638
For two weeks? In fucking Bruges?
In a room like this?

02:55.708 --> 02:57.335
With you? No way!

02:57.443 --> 03:00.139
Ray, I really don't
like to say this...

03:00.213 --> 03:02.579
You really don't
like to say what?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.378
Well... You know?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.785
Fucking bring that up.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.489
Do you think
this is good?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.585
Do I think what's good?

03:49.662 --> 03:52.859
You know, going round in
a boat, looking at stuff.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.431
Yes, I do.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.028
<i>It's called "sightseeing."</i>

04:08.848 --> 04:10.475
Oh, look at that.

04:13.886 --> 04:17.344
It's a former hospital.
From the 1100s.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.728
Bruges is the most
well-preserved medieval town

04:22.795 --> 04:25.195
in the whole of
Belgium, apparently.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.485
Coming up?
What's up there?

04:50.590 --> 04:52.217
The view.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.058
The view of what? The view of down
here? I can see that from down here.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.463
Ray, you're about the worst
tourist in the whole world.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.934
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.
I love Dublin.

05:04.003 --> 05:07.666
If I'd grown up on a farm and was
retarded, Bruges might impress me.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.867
But I didn't,
so it doesn't.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.615
Trying to get rid
of me coins.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.751
2, 2.50, 4,

05:27.827 --> 05:33.322
4.10, 4.20, 4.30,
4.40, 4.50, 4.60,

05:33.399 --> 05:35.629
4.70,

05:35.702 --> 05:37.226
4.80,

05:38.638 --> 05:40.435
4.90.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.972
Will you take 4.90?

05:45.044 --> 05:46.944
Entry is 5 euro.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.613
Come on, man,
it's only 10 cents.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.048
Entry is 5 euro.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.828
Happy in your work?

06:04.897 --> 06:05.921
Very happy.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.759
I like it here.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.065
Been to the top
of the tower?

07:14.133 --> 07:17.625
Yeah. Yeah, it's rubbish.

07:17.703 --> 07:20.763
<i>It is? The guidebook says
it's a "must-see".</i>

07:21.841 --> 07:24.332
Well, you lot
ain't going up there.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.002
Pardon me? Why?

07:26.078 --> 07:30.014
I mean, it's all windy stairs.
I'm not being funny.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.573
What exactly are you
trying to say?

07:33.252 --> 07:35.311
What exactly
am I trying to say?

07:35.388 --> 07:37.788
Youse are a bunch
of fucking elephants!

07:37.857 --> 07:39.347
Right, you...

07:46.632 --> 07:48.623
Come on, leave it, fatty.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.578
You know, you're just the
rudest man. The rudest man!

08:03.282 --> 08:05.147
What's all that about?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.550
They're not going up there.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.056
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up
there. It's really narrow.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.148
Screw you, motherfucker!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.327
Americans, isn't it?

08:23.035 --> 08:26.266
Now, this is more like it.
Proper holidays.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.863
One gay beer
for my gay friend,

08:27.940 --> 08:30.602
and one normal beer for me,
because I am normal.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.210
This is the life.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.873
We're not staying here
getting pissed.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.147
We are quietly sightseeing,
like he says,

08:38.217 --> 08:40.879
and awaiting his call
to see what we do next.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.886
This is my vote
on what we should do.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.549
We give it another day,
two days, max.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.458
Then we check the papers again, and
if there's still nothing in them,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.793
<i>we phone him and say, "Harry,
thank you for the trip to Bruges,</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.298
<i>"it's been very nice, all
the old buildings and that,</i>

08:54.367 --> 08:57.097
<i>"but we're coming back to London
now, and hide out in a proper country,</i>

08:57.169 --> 08:59.433
<i>"where it isn't all just
fucking chocolates."</i>

08:59.505 --> 09:02.997
My vote would be we quietly
sightsee, like he says,

09:03.676 --> 09:06.509
and await his call
to see what we do next.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.279
You don't even know
we're here hiding out.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.453
What are you talking about?

09:15.521 --> 09:17.819
You don't even know
we're not here on a job.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.915
What, on a job?
Yeah.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.516
Here in Bruges?
Yeah.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.994
Here in Bruges, on a job?
Yeah.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.425
Why? What did he
actually say?

09:26.499 --> 09:27.932
He didn't actually
say anything.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.901
Then why do you think it might
be? I don't think anything.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.939
But it's a bit fucking
over-elaborate, isn't it?

09:34.006 --> 09:36.531
<i>"Go take him to hide out."
"Go take him to hide out where?"</i>

09:36.609 --> 09:39.510
<i>"Go take him to hide out
in fucking Bruges."</i>

09:40.947 --> 09:43.074
You can hide out
in Croydon.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.406
Hmm.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.985
Or Coventry.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.345
Hmm.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.652
It is a bit
over-elaborate.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.752
Hmm.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.397
But we haven't
got any guns.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.765
Harry can get guns anywhere.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.185
He's not gonna ring tonight.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.993
He's not gonna ring tonight.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.095
Let's go out.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.106
Go out where?
The pub.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.198
No!

11:01.627 --> 11:03.527
Let's go out and have
a look at some of the...

11:03.596 --> 11:06.258
All the old medieval
buildings and that.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.893
Because I bet they look even
better at night, all lit up.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.465
Yes!

11:24.950 --> 11:27.942
That there is called
the Gruuthuse Museum.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.079
They all have funny
names, don't they?

11:30.156 --> 11:31.646
Yes, Flemish.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.658
<i>In here it says, "The Belgians twice
sheltered fugitive English Kings</i>

11:35.728 --> 11:38.629
<i>"from being murdered,
1471 and 1651."</i>

11:38.698 --> 11:41.030
I used to hate history,
didn't you?

11:41.100 --> 11:43.500
It's all just a load of stuff
that's already happened.

11:43.569 --> 11:45.503
What are they
doing over there?

11:45.571 --> 11:48.199
They're filming something.
They're filming midgets!

11:49.742 --> 11:50.868
Ray!

11:53.512 --> 11:58.074
So, on this scene, you're supposed
to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.355
Okay? Great.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.924
Ray, come on, let's go.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.826
<i>My arse, "Let's go."
They're filming midgets.</i>

12:12.231 --> 12:15.462
Oh, my God!
Look at that girl.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.058
She's gorgeous!

12:17.136 --> 12:18.330
Ray, we're going
right now.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.894
Fuck off, are we!

12:19.972 --> 12:23.806
This is the best bit of Bruges
so far. You and your buildings.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.494
Hello.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.832
Do you speak English?
No.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.872
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.572
What are you
filming midgets for?

13:01.647 --> 13:05.014
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.451
<i>It's a pastiche of Nicholas
Roeg's Don't Look Now.</i>

13:08.521 --> 13:10.489
Not a pastiche, but a...

13:11.557 --> 13:15.084
<i>A "homage" is too strong.
A" nod of the head"?</i>

13:17.496 --> 13:19.794
Wow, your English
is very good.

13:24.436 --> 13:27.166
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.939
A disproportionate amount.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.503
<i>Hervé Villechaize,
off of Fantasy Island.</i>

13:36.816 --> 13:39.614
<i>I think somebody
off The Time Bandits.</i>

13:39.685 --> 13:42.950
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

13:44.290 --> 13:46.053
being really
little and that.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.719
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

13:48.794 --> 13:52.059
<i>Calling them names.
You know, "shortarse."</i>

13:53.833 --> 13:57.792
There's another famous midget
I'm missing, but I can't remember.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.769
It's not the R2-D2 man.
No, he's still going.

14:03.142 --> 14:07.772
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.971
<i>He doesn't like being called
a midget. He prefers "dwarf."</i>

14:11.050 --> 14:13.450
Well, this is
exactly my point!

14:13.519 --> 14:16.647
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.555
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

14:21.327 --> 14:24.023
My name's Ray. What's yours?
Chloe.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.193
How did you get past
the security man?

14:28.267 --> 14:31.600
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.637
You're a shoplifter?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.764
No,
not a shoplifter.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.808
It's a good joke, though.

14:37.810 --> 14:38.936
No.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.510
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.891
Fuck.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.709
How fucking cool.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.588
Mr. Blakely?

15:27.660 --> 15:31.357
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.
No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.131
You have a message.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.499
Shit!

15:43.375 --> 15:46.572
<i>Number one, why aren't you
in when I fucking told you to be in?</i>

15:46.645 --> 15:49.773
<i>Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail</i>

15:49.848 --> 15:52.612
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?</i>

15:52.685 --> 15:55.586
<i>Number three, you better fucking be in
tomorrow night when I fucking call again</i>

15:55.654 --> 15:59.784
<i>or there'll be fucking Hell to
pay, I'm fucking telling you. Harry.</i>

16:37.062 --> 16:39.530
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

16:39.598 --> 16:41.122
Sorry, Ken.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.327
Keep the fucking
noise down!

16:46.505 --> 16:48.268
Someone's in a mood.

17:02.721 --> 17:03.813
You'll
never guess what.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.982
Will you shut your fucking
mouth, please, and go to sleep?

17:06.058 --> 17:07.719
Oh, sorry.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.223
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.808
Altogether,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.343
I had

17:26.678 --> 17:29.579
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

17:31.116 --> 17:35.382
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.082
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

17:43.996 --> 17:46.191
You'll never guess what, Ken.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.993
Ken, you'll never guess what.
What?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.195
Got a date for
tomorrow night.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.362
I'm very happy for you.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.564
With a girl.

17:53.639 --> 17:54.901
Can you turn
the light off, please?

17:55.007 --> 17:57.874
Only been in Bruges one day, got a
date with a girl in the film business,

17:57.943 --> 18:00.002
the Belgian film business.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.805
They're doing a film
about a midget.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.293
Miss?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.296
Marie?

18:28.574 --> 18:32.977
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

18:34.446 --> 18:36.437
Well, he's a bit of a...

18:37.049 --> 18:38.141
Cock?

18:39.318 --> 18:41.343
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.851
Morning.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.125
Harry called last night.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.293
We missed him.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.575
Jeez, he swears a lot,
doesn't he?

19:05.777 --> 19:08.837
We're staying in tonight.
Whatever happens.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.642
Hmm.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.315
Except...

19:15.888 --> 19:17.185
Hmm.
Hmm.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.948
<i>Except "hmm" what?</i>

19:19.024 --> 19:23.791
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.090
Uh-huh.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.327
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

19:29.401 --> 19:30.834
I thought you
didn't like Bruges.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.700
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

19:32.771 --> 19:36.571
But I did already say I had
a date with a Belgian lady

19:36.642 --> 19:40.703
in the Belgian film business, which
I did already say about before.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.914
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.113
We're keeping a low profile.

19:50.722 --> 19:54.453
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

19:54.526 --> 19:56.892
we are doing
what I want to do.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.725
Got it?
Of course.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.498
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

20:01.567 --> 20:05.298
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

20:05.370 --> 20:09.932
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance
shall tip in the favor of culture.

20:10.943 --> 20:14.811
Like a big, fat, fucking
retarded, fucking black girl

20:14.880 --> 20:17.576
on a seesaw, opposite

20:21.320 --> 20:22.582
a dwarf.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.251
Ray, did we
or did we not agree

21:01.326 --> 21:02.816
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

21:02.894 --> 21:04.862
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.795
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

21:06.865 --> 21:09.425
And that we'd do them without
you throwing a fucking moody,

21:09.501 --> 21:11.867
like some 5-year-old who's
dropped all his sweets?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.905
I didn't agree to that.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.867
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.245
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

21:21.013 --> 21:24.505
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.177
And that phial, do you know
what it's said to contain?

21:27.252 --> 21:28.810
No, what's it
said to contain?

21:28.887 --> 21:32.846
It's said to contain some
drops of Jesus Christ's blood.

21:32.924 --> 21:36.655
Yeah, that's how this church got
its name. Basilica of the Holy Blood.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.093
Yeah. Yeah.

21:38.163 --> 21:41.030
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

21:41.133 --> 21:45.194
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.932
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.133
At various times of great

21:51.743 --> 21:52.971
stress.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.342
Yeah?
Yeah.

21:54.413 --> 21:59.510
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.745
Yeah?
Yeah. You coming?

22:02.788 --> 22:04.278
Do I have to?

22:05.824 --> 22:08.759
Do you have to?
Of course you don't have to.

22:08.827 --> 22:12.695
It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't fucking have to!

22:12.764 --> 22:15.289
Of course you don't
fucking have to!

22:59.211 --> 23:01.202
You little fucking cunt.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.138
<i>Murder, Father.</i>

23:37.516 --> 23:38.813
<i>Why did you
murder someone, Raymond?</i>

23:41.386 --> 23:43.445
For money, Father.

23:43.855 --> 23:45.220
For money?

23:46.358 --> 23:48.258
You murdered
someone for money?

23:48.326 --> 23:49.315
Yes, Father.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.659
Not out of anger, not
out of nothing. For money.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.927
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

23:58.703 --> 24:00.102
You, Father.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.334
I'm sorry?

24:03.408 --> 24:06.104
I said you, Father.
What, are you deaf?

24:06.545 --> 24:08.513
Harry Waters says hello.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.395
The little boy.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.098
I quite like this one.

26:16.174 --> 26:20.440
All the rest were rubbish by
spastics, but this one's quite good.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.537
What's that
all about, then?

26:23.415 --> 26:27.545
It's Judgment Day, you know?
Oh, yeah.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.080
What's that then?

26:33.158 --> 26:36.252
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

26:36.995 --> 26:42.023
When mankind will be judged for all
the crimes they've committed and that.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.038
And see who gets into Heaven and
who gets into Hell and all that?

26:47.105 --> 26:48.163
Yeah.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.036
And what's the other place?

26:50.108 --> 26:51.336
Purgatory.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.673
Purgatory?

26:53.745 --> 26:56.839
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

26:56.915 --> 27:00.908
You weren't really shit, but you
weren't all that great, either.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.077
Like Tottenham.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.490
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

27:06.558 --> 27:08.048
About Tottenham?

27:08.126 --> 27:10.492
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.457
Guilt and sins and

27:17.969 --> 27:20.733
Hell and all that?

27:23.408 --> 27:24.397
Um...

27:27.812 --> 27:28.801
Well...

27:35.420 --> 27:38.480
I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

27:38.857 --> 27:42.315
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

27:42.394 --> 27:44.658
So, like, I believe in
trying to lead a good life.

27:44.729 --> 27:48.392
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

27:48.466 --> 27:52.197
I don't try and help her carry
her shopping, I don't go that far,

27:52.270 --> 27:56.468
but I'll certainly hold the door open for
her and that, and let her go out before me.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.668
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried
to help her carry her shopping,

27:58.743 --> 28:00.677
she'd probably think you were
just trying to nick her shopping.

28:00.745 --> 28:03.578
Exactly.
This is the world we live in today.

28:03.648 --> 28:06.981
At the same time as
trying to lead a good life,

28:08.353 --> 28:12.687
I have to reconcile myself with the
fact that, yes, I have killed people.

28:13.658 --> 28:17.185
Not many people. Most of them
were not very nice people.

28:17.729 --> 28:19.890
Apart from one person.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.363
Who's that?

28:21.433 --> 28:23.867
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

28:23.935 --> 28:27.393
He was just trying to protect
his brother. Like you or I would.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.770
He was just a lollipop man.

28:29.841 --> 28:33.299
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

28:33.378 --> 28:34.777
I shot him down.

28:34.846 --> 28:35.835
Hmm.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.348
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

28:40.418 --> 28:42.978
that is a deadly weapon, he's
gotta take the consequences.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.453
I know that in my heart.

28:44.522 --> 28:46.820
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

28:46.891 --> 28:49.257
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

28:49.327 --> 28:50.521
It's a case of
it's you or him.

28:50.595 --> 28:52.495
If he'd come at you with his
bare hands, that'd be different.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.588
That wouldn't
have been fair.

28:53.665 --> 28:56.031
Well, technically, your bare
hands can kill somebody, too.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.899
They can be deadly weapons, too. I
mean, what if he knew karate, say?

28:58.970 --> 29:00.198
You said he was
a lollipop man.

29:00.271 --> 29:02.102
He was a lollipop man.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.437
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

29:04.509 --> 29:05.533
I'm just saying.

29:05.610 --> 29:08.170
How old was he?
About 50.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.680
What's a 50-year-old lollipop
man doing knowing fucking karate?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.115
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

29:13.184 --> 29:16.278
Jesus, Ken, I'm
trying to talk about...

29:24.696 --> 29:26.596
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

29:26.664 --> 29:29.963
I killed a little boy. You keep
bringing up fucking lollipop men!

29:30.034 --> 29:31.797
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.838
I know I didn't mean to.

29:35.874 --> 29:39.401
But because of the choices I made
and the course that I put into action,

29:39.477 --> 29:41.741
a little boy
isn't here anymore.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.043
And he'll never
be here again.

29:48.653 --> 29:51.645
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.918
Well, he'll never be here
in Belgium, either, will he?

29:54.993 --> 29:58.292
I mean, he might have wanted
to come here when he got older.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.990
I don't know why.

30:01.566 --> 30:03.761
And that's all because of me.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.964
He's dead because of me.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.472
And I'm trying to...

30:10.208 --> 30:13.405
I'm trying to get me head
around it, but I can't.

30:14.579 --> 30:17.377
I will always have
killed that little boy.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.751
That ain't ever
going away. Ever.

30:23.188 --> 30:24.450
Unless...

30:25.824 --> 30:27.416
Maybe I go away.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.423
Don't even think like that.

31:30.021 --> 31:31.511
You look good.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.862
What's it matter anyway?

32:03.187 --> 32:04.745
So, what do you do, Raymond?

32:04.822 --> 32:07.723
I shoot people for money.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.324
What kinds of people?

32:12.397 --> 32:15.696
Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.792
Is there a lot of money to be
made in that line of business?

32:17.869 --> 32:19.894
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.233
So what is it
you do, Chloe?

32:21.306 --> 32:24.400
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.070
Do you?

32:28.613 --> 32:30.410
Do I look like I do?

32:31.983 --> 32:33.575
You do, actually.

32:36.587 --> 32:39.488
Do I look like
I shoot people?

32:40.758 --> 32:41.782
No.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.185
Just children.

32:45.730 --> 32:46.992
Mmm-hmm.

32:52.770 --> 32:56.137
I saw your midget today.
Little prick didn't even say hello.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.072
Well, he's on
a lot of ketamine.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.575
What's that?

33:01.279 --> 33:02.678
Horse tranquilizer.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.339
A horse tranquilizer?

33:04.415 --> 33:06.883
Where'd he get that?
I sold it to him.

33:06.951 --> 33:10.045
You can't sell horse
tranquilizers to a midget!

33:13.257 --> 33:15.589
This movie, I think it's
gonna be a very good one.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.060
There's never been a classic
movie made in Bruges until now.

33:18.129 --> 33:19.756
Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.093
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.359
Well, it's still a shithole.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.457
It's not a shithole.

33:23.534 --> 33:26.059
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

33:26.137 --> 33:27.399
Okay.

33:28.940 --> 33:33.070
So, you've insulted
my hometown.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.544
You're doing
very well, Raymond.

33:35.613 --> 33:38.047
Why don't you tell me some
Belgian jokes while you're at it?

33:38.116 --> 33:39.708
I don't know
any Belgian jokes.

33:39.784 --> 33:43.083
And if I did,
I think I'd have the good sense not to...

33:43.154 --> 33:47.648
Hey, hang on. Is Belgium where there
were all those child abuse murders lately?

33:47.725 --> 33:49.955
Then I do know
a Belgian joke.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.355
What's Belgium famous for?

33:54.799 --> 33:56.232
Chocolates and child abuse.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.895
And they only invented the
chocolates to get to the kids.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.267
What?

34:02.874 --> 34:06.173
One of the girls they
murdered was a friend of mine.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.581
I'm sorry, Chloe.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.158
One of the girls they murdered
wasn't a friend of mine.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.964
I just wanted to
make you feel bad.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.369
And it worked.
Quite well.

34:54.992 --> 34:56.789
Fucking unbelievable.

35:10.074 --> 35:11.837
What's fucking
unbelievable?

35:11.909 --> 35:13.774
Are you talking to me?

35:15.379 --> 35:18.576
He pauses, even though
he should just hit the cunt.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.014
And he repeats.

35:20.084 --> 35:24.487
Yes, I am talking to you.
What's fucking unbelievable?

35:24.555 --> 35:26.887
Well, I'll tell you what's
fucking unbelievable, shall I?

35:26.958 --> 35:29.620
Blowing cigarette smoke straight
into myself and my girlfriend's face.

35:29.694 --> 35:30.922
That's fucking unbelievable!

35:30.995 --> 35:34.158
This is the smoking section. I don't
care if it's the smoking section.

35:34.232 --> 35:36.598
All right?
She directed it right in my face, man.

35:36.667 --> 35:39.602
I don't wanna die just because
of your fucking arrogance. Uh-huh.

35:39.670 --> 35:42.639
Isn't that what the
Vietnamese used to say?

35:42.707 --> 35:45.904
Vietnamese? What are you
talking about, the Vietnamese?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.706
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.643
Yes it does.
The Vietnamese!

35:49.714 --> 35:52.376
Well, saying it over and over ain't
gonna make any more sense out of it.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.317
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever

35:55.386 --> 35:57.911
to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

35:57.989 --> 35:59.650
your friend's
cigarette smoke?

35:59.724 --> 36:01.783
Tell me how saying...

36:02.360 --> 36:05.454
That's for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

36:05.930 --> 36:08.228
A bottle? No, don't bother.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.741
We're leaving.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.214
I don't hit women!
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

36:28.152 --> 36:30.177
I'd hit a woman who was
trying to hit me with a bottle!

36:30.254 --> 36:32.984
That's different.
That's self-defense, isn't it?

36:33.057 --> 36:35.457
Or a woman
who could do karate.

36:35.526 --> 36:39.223
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe.
Don't think that.

36:39.297 --> 36:41.026
God, you're pretty.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.467
I have to make a call.

36:44.535 --> 36:45.559
Oh, no.

36:46.204 --> 36:50.732
You've gone off me, now, haven't you?
Just because I hit that fucking cow.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.132
<i>Hello?
- Where the fuck were you yesterday?</i>

37:18.636 --> 37:21.833
We just popped out for some dinner,
Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.396
<i>Yeah? What'd you have?</i>

37:23.474 --> 37:25.271
<i>For dinner?
Yeah.</i>

37:25.343 --> 37:26.503
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.635
<i>Was it nice?</i>

37:27.712 --> 37:29.612
Yeah, it was all right. I
don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.170
The same as in England.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.980
<i>Well, that's globalization,
isn't it? Is Ray there with you?</i>

37:35.686 --> 37:37.620
He's in the toilet.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.883
<i>Can he hear?
No.</i>

37:39.957 --> 37:41.652
<i>What's he doing?</i>

37:41.726 --> 37:44.889
<i>What do you mean?
Is he doing a wee or a poo?</i>

37:44.962 --> 37:46.589
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

37:46.664 --> 37:50.896
<i>Send him out on an errand for half an
hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:59.569
Ray? Why don't you go out down
to the pub for half an hour?

38:02.246 --> 38:05.079
Yeah, yeah, I know
I said you couldn't,

38:05.149 --> 38:06.878
but might as well
enjoy ourselves, eh?

38:07.918 --> 38:12.116
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere. Could have a look.

38:13.257 --> 38:14.747
Yeah, see you.

38:25.903 --> 38:27.131
Yeah. He's gone.

38:27.204 --> 38:29.468
<i>What'd you say to him?</i>

38:29.540 --> 38:31.974
<i>I said, "Why don't you go have a
drink, you say you've been cooped up?"</i>

38:32.043 --> 38:34.102
<i>What did he say?
Said, yeah, he would.</i>

38:34.178 --> 38:36.703
And he might go have a look to see
if there's a bowling alley around.

38:36.781 --> 38:38.408
<i>Was he just having a wee?</i>

38:38.482 --> 38:40.313
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

38:40.384 --> 38:41.442
<i>Sure he didn't mind?</i>

38:41.519 --> 38:43.077
No, he was glad
to get out.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.280
<i>He's definitely gone?</i>

38:44.355 --> 38:45.788
Yeah, yeah,
he slammed the door.

38:45.856 --> 38:49.121
<i>That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.</i>

39:05.976 --> 39:07.807
Harry, he's definitely gone.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.073
<i>You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?</i>

39:10.147 --> 39:12.638
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

39:12.717 --> 39:15.083
<i>What are they gonna have, a
medieval fucking bowling alley?</i>

39:15.152 --> 39:17.450
As I say, I think he was just
glad to get out and about.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.513
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

39:20.591 --> 39:22.752
<i>I had a lovely time
when I was there.</i>

39:22.827 --> 39:25.352
<i>All the canals and the
old buildings and that.</i>

39:25.429 --> 39:26.521
When were you here?

39:26.597 --> 39:30.431
<i>When I was seven. Last
happy holiday I fucking had.</i>

39:30.935 --> 39:33.563
<i>Have you been on a canal trip, yet?
- Yeah.</i>

39:33.637 --> 39:35.832
<i>Have you been down, like, all
the old cobbled streets and that?</i>

39:35.906 --> 39:36.964
Yeah.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.236
<i>It's like a fairytale, isn't it, that place?
- Yeah.</i>

39:39.310 --> 39:41.244
<i>With the churches and that. They're Gothic.
- Yeah.</i>

39:41.312 --> 39:42.870
<i>Is it Gothic?
Yeah.</i>

39:42.947 --> 39:45.507
<i>So he's having
a really nice time?</i>

39:45.583 --> 39:48.416
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

39:48.486 --> 39:51.250
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.117
<i>What?</i>

39:55.626 --> 39:57.617
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.322
<i>What do you mean,
"It's not really his thing"?</i>

39:59.397 --> 40:01.524
<i>What's that supposed to mean,
"It's not really his thing"?</i>

40:01.599 --> 40:02.930
<i>What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?</i>

40:03.000 --> 40:04.024
Nothing, Harry.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.194
<i>It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?</i>

40:06.270 --> 40:09.034
<i>How can a fairytale town not
be somebody's fucking thing?</i>

40:09.106 --> 40:12.234
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

40:12.309 --> 40:14.573
<i>all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

40:14.645 --> 40:16.545
<i>how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

40:16.614 --> 40:17.945
What I think
I meant to say was...

40:18.015 --> 40:19.812
<i>Is the swan still there?
Yeah, the swan's...</i>

40:19.884 --> 40:23.012
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

40:23.087 --> 40:24.213
<i>How can that be?</i>

40:24.288 --> 40:25.414
What I think
I meant to say was,

40:25.489 --> 40:28.652
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.719
You know, there's that big, dual
carriageway when you get off the train?

40:32.797 --> 40:35.061
It mightn't have been here
when you were here last, Harry.

40:35.132 --> 40:38.101
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

40:38.169 --> 40:42.037
and he saw the canals and the bridges
and, you know, the swans and that,

40:42.106 --> 40:44.040
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.635
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

40:47.711 --> 40:52.341
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

40:52.416 --> 40:54.111
<i>Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.</i>

40:54.185 --> 40:55.516
<i>Must be recent.</i>

40:55.586 --> 40:56.951
<i>Hasn't spoilt it, has it?</i>

40:57.021 --> 41:00.286
No, no, no, it's just
that initial thing.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.455
And you know what?

41:05.696 --> 41:07.823
As we were walking
through the streets,

41:07.898 --> 41:13.063
there was this sort of freezing
fog hanging over everything,

41:13.504 --> 41:17.304
and it made it look almost
like a fairytale or something.

41:17.374 --> 41:18.898
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

41:18.976 --> 41:20.534
<i>What'd he say?</i>

41:20.611 --> 41:25.639
<i>He said, "Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

41:25.716 --> 41:28.082
<i>Yeah? He said that?</i>

41:28.152 --> 41:29.176
Yeah.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.813
<i>Meaning, like,
in a good dream?</i>

41:31.889 --> 41:34.756
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

41:34.825 --> 41:38.226
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad
he likes it there.</i>

41:38.295 --> 41:40.263
<i>I'm glad we were able
to give him something.</i>

41:40.331 --> 41:44.165
<i>Something good and happy. Because
he wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

41:45.603 --> 41:46.695
Huh?

41:46.971 --> 41:49.337
<i>He wasn't a bad kid,
was he?</i>

41:50.441 --> 41:53.467
<i>Listen, take down this
address. Raamstraat 17.</i>

41:53.544 --> 41:56.604
<i>That's "Raam," like "Ram,"
but with an extra "a."</i>

41:57.581 --> 41:58.673
Raamstraat 17.

41:58.749 --> 42:00.341
<i>You got that?</i>

42:00.718 --> 42:02.151
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

42:02.219 --> 42:06.451
<i>Good. There'll be a man there tomorrow
morning at 9:00, his name's Yuri.</i>

42:06.524 --> 42:08.219
<i>Yuri.
He'll give you the gun.</i>

42:08.292 --> 42:10.192
<i>Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's</i>

42:10.261 --> 42:13.094
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,
after it's done.</i>

42:14.064 --> 42:15.725
After what's done?

42:16.433 --> 42:18.196
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

42:19.904 --> 42:21.599
<i>No.
Listen, I like Ray.</i>

42:21.672 --> 42:24.072
<i>He was a good bloke, but when it
all comes down to it, you know,</i>

42:24.141 --> 42:27.235
<i>he blew the head off a little fucking kid.
And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

42:27.311 --> 42:30.769
<i>So if the buck don't stop
with him, where does it stop?</i>

42:36.287 --> 42:37.345
<i>Ken?</i>

42:38.522 --> 42:40.888
<i>If the buck don't stop with
him, where does it stop?</i>

42:40.958 --> 42:42.949
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.154
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

42:46.063 --> 42:51.000
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able to
do something for the boy before he went.</i>

42:51.068 --> 42:52.695
Do what for the boy?

42:52.770 --> 42:55.204
<i>You know, have him
get to see Bruges.</i>

42:56.040 --> 42:59.203
<i>I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.</i>

42:59.977 --> 43:03.504
<i>What was it he said again
about... Yeah, "It's like a dream."</i>

43:05.282 --> 43:08.547
<i>"I know I'm awake, but I
feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

43:11.021 --> 43:12.113
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:13.991 --> 43:16.289
<i>Give me a call
when he's dead.</i>

43:40.384 --> 43:43.785
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

43:43.854 --> 43:45.082
Eirik, what are you doing?

43:45.155 --> 43:46.918
Where are you from, fucker?

43:46.991 --> 43:48.458
Ireland, originally.

43:49.259 --> 43:51.523
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

43:51.595 --> 43:53.358
and fuck another man's girl?

43:53.430 --> 43:55.261
Look, I didn't know she
had a boyfriend, all right?

43:55.332 --> 43:58.301
And I haven't fucked her, anyway.
Ask her. I'd only put me hand on it.

43:58.369 --> 44:00.337
Eirik, put the gun down!

44:01.538 --> 44:03.972
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

44:04.041 --> 44:05.599
Don't start being silly.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.439
Get down on your...

44:08.345 --> 44:11.940
Exactly at what point was it that
all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

44:12.016 --> 44:13.176
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

44:13.250 --> 44:15.514
you just went around beating
up Pakistani 12-year-olds.

44:15.586 --> 44:18.885
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

44:20.424 --> 44:21.618
That's not gonna
help you, man.

44:21.692 --> 44:24.456
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.832
Eirik, don't!

44:32.903 --> 44:34.200
Now who's the
fucking bum-boy?

44:34.271 --> 44:36.501
You, you fucking bum-boy!

44:38.676 --> 44:40.507
Chloe, what exactly
is going on here?

44:40.577 --> 44:42.738
I can't see!
I can't see!

44:42.813 --> 44:47.216
Of course you can't fucking see! I
just shot a blank in your fucking eyes!

44:47.284 --> 44:52.221
Is this fella your boyfriend?
No. I mean, he used to be.

44:52.289 --> 44:53.449
Well, what's he doing here?

44:53.524 --> 44:56.960
We... We rob tourists,
sometimes.

44:57.027 --> 44:59.962
I fucking knew it was
too good to be true!

45:00.330 --> 45:02.093
I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.396
No! That's not true, I...

45:04.468 --> 45:07.835
I called it off tonight. I
told him not to come tonight.

45:07.905 --> 45:09.031
Why did you come tonight?

45:09.106 --> 45:10.801
Chloe,
I can't see, I swear it!

45:10.874 --> 45:13.365
Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.002
I haven't had
a shag in months!

45:15.079 --> 45:20.073
I can't see out of this eye,
Chloe! I have to go to the hospital!

45:20.150 --> 45:21.879
I'll drive you.

45:21.952 --> 45:23.715
Great! Now the whole
night's ruined!

45:23.787 --> 45:25.049
No!

45:25.122 --> 45:29.081
You can stay if you want.
I just don't know how long I'll be.

45:29.159 --> 45:32.026
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.860
I just knew.
What do you mean, someone like me?

45:34.932 --> 45:36.900
You know, someone nice.

45:44.274 --> 45:46.765
Call me. Please.

45:52.049 --> 45:53.311
Chloe!

46:33.290 --> 46:34.279
Cha-ching!

47:04.087 --> 47:05.554
Have you got some
sort of problem?

47:05.622 --> 47:07.590
No, no problem.

47:07.658 --> 47:10.388
Four beers in 20 minutes.
No problem.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.591
Fuck off.

47:21.705 --> 47:23.832
Beer and a red wine.

47:23.907 --> 47:25.374
I'll be back.

47:27.945 --> 47:29.742
How's the movie going?

47:29.813 --> 47:33.977
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece
of rip-off fucking bullshit.

47:34.051 --> 47:35.985
Like, in a bad way?

47:39.489 --> 47:41.184
Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

47:41.258 --> 47:45.058
She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

47:47.130 --> 47:49.621
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.100
You just have to look
in the right places.

47:52.169 --> 47:53.830
Brothels are good.

47:55.372 --> 47:58.364
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

47:58.442 --> 47:59.807
Thank you.

48:04.281 --> 48:06.044
You from the States?

48:06.884 --> 48:08.010
Yeah.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.852
But don't hold it
against me.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.285
I'll try not to.

48:12.789 --> 48:15.849
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.943
Hey-ho. Drowning
your sorrows, huh?

48:36.013 --> 48:39.744
What sorrows?
- You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.

48:39.816 --> 48:41.010
One gay beer, please.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.210
How'd your date go?

48:42.286 --> 48:44.516
My date involved two
instances of extreme violence.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.613
One instance of her hand on my
cock and my finger up her thing,

48:46.690 --> 48:49.591
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

48:49.660 --> 48:53.061
One instance of me stealing five
grams of her very-high-quality cocaine,

48:53.130 --> 48:55.291
and one instance of me blinding
a poofy little skinhead.

48:55.365 --> 48:58.562
So, all in all, my evening
pretty much balanced out fine.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.728
You got five grams of coke?

49:01.505 --> 49:03.200
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

49:03.273 --> 49:04.570
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

49:04.641 --> 49:05.869
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.138
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

49:08.211 --> 49:09.838
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

49:09.913 --> 49:11.346
Give us a gram, then.

49:11.415 --> 49:13.383
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

49:13.450 --> 49:16.851
You know what? Right now,
I don't really give a fuck.

49:45.048 --> 49:48.176
Why didn't you wave hello to me
today when I waved hello to you today?

49:48.251 --> 49:50.811
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

49:50.887 --> 49:55.790
I wasn't waving hello to
anybody, except maybe to a horse.

49:56.259 --> 49:58.693
Huh? What are you
talking about?

49:58.762 --> 50:00.821
Just horseshit.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.561
You from America?

50:03.633 --> 50:06.193
Yeah. But don't
hold it against me.

50:06.269 --> 50:09.204
Well, that's for me
to decide, isn't it?

50:09.272 --> 50:10.705
Are you from America, too?

50:10.774 --> 50:12.298
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

50:12.376 --> 50:13.775
Amsterdam.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.677
Amsterdam is just a load of
bloody prostitutes, isn't it?

50:16.747 --> 50:18.738
Yes. That's why
I came to Bruges.

50:18.815 --> 50:22.080
I thought I'd get a better
price for my pussy here.

50:23.854 --> 50:24.843
Huh?

50:26.456 --> 50:28.117
You two are weird.

50:30.227 --> 50:32.354
Would you like some cocaine?

50:34.898 --> 50:37.696
I've also got some
acid and some ecstasy.

50:48.545 --> 50:51.036
Hervé Villechaize,
I know, did.

50:51.114 --> 50:53.878
<i>The dwarf off, I think,
The Time Bandits, did.</i>

50:55.118 --> 50:56.779
Lots of midgets...

50:57.354 --> 50:59.879
Dwarves, top themselves.

51:00.323 --> 51:02.086
Hmm. Shitloads.

51:04.928 --> 51:06.293
Would you ever
think about it?

51:06.730 --> 51:07.719
Huh?

51:08.065 --> 51:11.432
Would you ever think about killing
yourself because you're a midget?

51:11.501 --> 51:14.561
Fuck, man!
What kind of question is that?

51:14.638 --> 51:16.196
We're just chatting,
aren't we?

51:22.913 --> 51:26.007
See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.517
A five-star,
with prostitutes in.

51:29.186 --> 51:33.782
You know, sometimes, I think Harry
doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

51:35.258 --> 51:37.226
Has he still not called?

51:39.029 --> 51:40.656
No. Still hasn't called.

51:40.730 --> 51:42.322
No news is good news, eh?

51:51.708 --> 51:52.697
Hmm.

51:53.910 --> 51:55.241
Who's she?

51:57.114 --> 51:59.241
There's gonna be
a war, man.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.448
I can see it.

52:01.518 --> 52:05.511
There's gonna be a war between
the blacks and between the whites.

52:05.589 --> 52:08.057
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.787
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side.

52:10.861 --> 52:12.294
Your side's already
picked for you.

52:12.362 --> 52:15.388
And I know whose side I'm fighting on.
I'm fighting with the blacks.

52:15.465 --> 52:17.126
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

52:17.200 --> 52:19.430
You don't decide
this shit, man.

52:19.503 --> 52:21.403
Well, who are the
half-castes gonna fight with?

52:21.471 --> 52:24.133
The blacks, man.
That's obvious.

52:24.207 --> 52:26.641
But what about
the Pakistanis?

52:27.711 --> 52:30.339
The blacks.
What about...

52:31.348 --> 52:32.872
Think of a hard one.

52:33.850 --> 52:35.909
What about the Vietnamese?

52:35.986 --> 52:37.453
The blacks!

52:37.521 --> 52:42.083
Well, I'm definitely fighting with the
blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.

52:46.196 --> 52:47.595
So, hang on.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.261
Would all of the white midgets
in the world be fighting

52:50.333 --> 52:51.766
against all the black
midgets in the world?

52:51.835 --> 52:53.598
Yeah.

52:54.304 --> 52:56.431
That would make a good film!

52:57.307 --> 53:02.040
You don't know how much shit I've
had to take off of black midgets, man.

53:02.579 --> 53:03.876
That's...

53:05.482 --> 53:07.211
Undeniably true.

53:07.284 --> 53:08.751
See, Jimmy,

53:10.253 --> 53:11.914
my wife was black.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.548
And I loved her very much.

53:16.660 --> 53:21.654
And in 1976, she was
murdered by a white man.

53:23.366 --> 53:27.530
So, where the fuck am I supposed to
stand in all this blood and carnage?

53:29.139 --> 53:31.471
Did they get
the guy who did it?

53:31.908 --> 53:33.000
A friend of mine got him.

53:33.076 --> 53:35.101
Harry Waters got him.

53:36.680 --> 53:41.515
So tell me, Jim, whose side do
I fight on in this wonderful war?

53:44.588 --> 53:47.648
I think you need to
weigh up all your options

53:48.758 --> 53:51.283
and let your
conscience decide, Ken.

54:00.537 --> 54:04.633
Two manky hookers
and a racist dwarf.

54:05.175 --> 54:06.335
I think I'm heading home.

54:06.409 --> 54:08.843
Yeah. I think
I'll come with you.

54:10.680 --> 54:13.672
What's...
Back off, shorty!

54:13.750 --> 54:15.650
You don't know karate.

54:15.719 --> 54:16.708
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

54:16.786 --> 54:18.583
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

54:18.888 --> 54:20.219
Shortarse!

55:47.243 --> 55:48.437
Meeting Yuri.

55:48.511 --> 55:49.603
Yes, I'm Yuri.

56:19.242 --> 56:21.972
Mr. Waters said
that might be necessary.

56:25.215 --> 56:28.673
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

56:29.586 --> 56:31.781
<i>You use this word,
"alcoves"?</i>

56:32.589 --> 56:34.819
<i>"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.</i>

56:34.891 --> 56:39.055
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime.

56:39.596 --> 56:42.929
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

56:45.702 --> 56:48.637
<i>Are you sure this is
the right word, "alcoves"?</i>

56:48.705 --> 56:52.368
<i>"Alcoves," yes. It's kind
of like "nooks and crannies."</i>

56:52.442 --> 56:56.538
<i>"Nooks and crannies," yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.</i>

56:56.613 --> 57:00.014
<i>"Nooks and crannies,"
rather than "alcoves." Yeah.</i>

57:06.356 --> 57:10.793
You are going to do it, aren't you?
Mr. Waters will be very disappointed...

57:10.860 --> 57:13.454
Of course I'm going to
fucking do it.

57:14.998 --> 57:16.556
It's what I do.

57:22.839 --> 57:26.104
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

57:33.583 --> 57:35.107
Oddly? How?

57:35.185 --> 57:39.315
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

57:40.156 --> 57:43.557
I said I didn't mind as long
as it's healthy, of course.

57:43.626 --> 57:47.960
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

57:49.466 --> 57:54.369
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

57:56.206 --> 57:59.266
Would you give it back
to him when you see him?

58:00.009 --> 58:04.036
I don't want to appear ungrateful, but
it seemed like all the money he had.

58:04.113 --> 58:08.106
Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

59:07.710 --> 59:09.075
Sorry, Ray.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.345
I'm sorry.

59:43.046 --> 59:44.240
Ray, don't!

59:44.314 --> 59:46.908
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck did you come from?

59:46.983 --> 59:49.975
I was behind the thing. What
the fuck are you doing, Ray?

59:50.053 --> 59:51.543
What the fuck
are you doing?

59:51.621 --> 59:52.679
Nothing.

59:54.891 --> 59:56.290
Oh, my God!

59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.888
You were gonna kill me.
No, I wasn't.

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.558
You were gonna
kill yourself!

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:07.633
I'm allowed to.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:08.728
No, you're not!

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:09.931
What?

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:13.441
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.780
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.185
I wasn't gonna go
through with it, Ray.

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:33.319
You fucking looked like you were
gonna go fucking through with it.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.060
Where'd you get that gun?

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.725
A friend of Harry's.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.132
Fuck, man.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.262
Let me see it.

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.767
Silencer, too.

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:53.407
Nice.

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:01.286
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.924
I'm keeping it.
Pardon me?

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:17.468
Give me me gun back.
You're not getting it back.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.666
You're a suicide case.

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:21.471
And you were trying to
shoot me in the fucking head.

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.102
You're not getting
that gun back.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:26.012
A great day this has
turned out to be.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:29.051
I'm suicidal, me
mate tries to kill me,

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:32.747
me gun gets nicked and we're
still in fucking Bruges.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:38.357
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere.

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:39.793
Back to England?

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:42.888
You can't go back to England, Ray.
You'd be a dead man!

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.024
I want
to be a dead man.

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.762
Have you been
missing something?

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:50.769
You don't want to be
a dead man, Ray.

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.474
I killed a little boy!

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.789
Then save the
next little boy.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:15.287
Just go away somewhere,

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:19.468
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.061
You're not gonna
help anybody dead.

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:26.233
You're not gonna
bring that boy back.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.676
But you might save
the next one.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:34.411
What am I gonna be,
a doctor?

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.676
You need exams.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:40.115
Do anything, Ray.
Do anything.

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:58.162
What a wanker!

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.167
He said this whole trip,

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.647
this whole being
in Bruges thing,

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:11.216
was just to give you one last,
joyful memory before you died.

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:14.053
In Bruges?

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.491
The Bahamas, maybe.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.195
Why fucking Bruges?

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.802
I suppose it's cheaper.

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:37.104
The rest of the acid
and the ecstasy.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.479
Can I have me gun
back, please?

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.456
What am I gonna do, Ken?

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.220
What am I gonna do?
Just keep moving.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.262
Keep on moving.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.389
Try not to think about it.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.100
Learn a new language, maybe?

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.159
Sure, I can
hardly do English.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.465
That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.631
You don't have to learn
any of their languages.

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:07.403
Just forget about
home for a while.

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:10.934
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:13.208
Seven years is not that long.

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.976
It's longer than
that boy got.

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:18.543
Me first fucking job.

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:22.221
Great hitman
I turned out to be.

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:28.997
Some people just aren't
cut out for it, Ray.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:30.860
Are you?

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.664
When are you
going back to England?

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.502
I'll head back in a couple
of hours or something.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:46.207
Harry's not gonna be mad at you, is he?
For letting me go?

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:47.873
I'll sort out Harry.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.147
Just tell him I'll have probably
killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.211
You won't, will you, Ray?

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:15.075
Harry? It's Ken.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.736
Listen to this noise.

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:21.345
Do you know what that is?

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:25.319
Yeah, I know you know it's a train.
Do you know what train?

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:28.789
Well, it's a train that Ray just
got on, and he's alive and he's well,

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:31.258
and he doesn't know where
he's going and neither do I.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:34.160
So if you need to do
your worst, do your worst.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:37.461
You've got the address of the
hotel. I'll be here waiting.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:40.593
Because I've got to quite
like Bruges, now.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.661
It's like a fucking
fairytale or something.

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.529
Harry.

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.497
Harry!

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.130
What?

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:19.265
It's an inanimate
fucking object.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.833
You're an inanimate
fucking object!

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.785
Now, you lot be good for
your mummy and Imamoto, okay?

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:36.848
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:37.915
Where are you going?

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.586
I've got to go to Bruges.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.254
Bruges? Where's that?

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.388
It's in Belgium.

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.166
Why would anybody
have to go to Belgium?

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:48.931
'Cause I've got to
sort something out.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.439
Is it something
to do with the phone?

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.270
It's something
to do with Ken.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.808
It's a matter of honor.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.744
Well, it ain't gonna
be dangerous, is it?

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.985
Well, of course it's gonna be dangerous
if it's a matter of fucking honor!

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.546
You are bringing
the fellas with you?

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.491
Tell me you're bringing
the fellas with you.

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.256
Harry.

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:16.729
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object.

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.198
I was upset.

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:00.535
You're Irish?
Yes.

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.665
What is your name?

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.934
Derek Perlurrl.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.542
You hit the Canadian.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.081
You hit the Canadian.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:20.111
<i>I "heet" the Canadian? I don't
know what you're talking about.</i>

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.350
That's him!
That's the motherfucker.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.727
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.898
Canadian? Shit.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:46.380
We're taking you back to Bruges.
Brilliant.

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.237
Aye aye.

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.405
Take your pick,
Mr. Waters.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.651
An Uzi?

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.586
I'm not from South Central
Los fucking Angeles.

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:30.386
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black
10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:33.189
I want a normal gun
for a normal person.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:47.139
I knew he wouldn't
kill the guy.

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:51.373
I could see it in his eyes when I
was telling him about the alcoves.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.173
About the what?
The alcoves.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.014
The alcoves in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.885
Oh, I also have
some dumdums.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:05.415
<i>You use this word, "dumdums"? The
bullets that make the head explode?</i>

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:06.859
Dumdums, yeah.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.523
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.795
I know I shouldn't,

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:14.800
but I will.

01:11:19.808 --> 01:11:21.275
Motherfucker.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:23.602
Is he talking to me?

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.840
No, Eirik's on your
side, Mr. Waters.

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:27.939
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.075
Ray did?

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:32.450
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:36.088
And the gun
was full of blanks,

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.785
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:43.456
And now, I cannot see from this
eye ever again, the doctors say.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:47.499
Well, to be honest, it sounds
like it was all your fault.

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.593
What?

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.469
I mean, basically, if you're robbing
a man and you're only carrying blanks,

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.474
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.772
and you allow yourself to be
shot in the eye with a blank,

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:59.405
for which I assume the person has
to get quite close to you, then,

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:02.746
yeah, really, it's all your
fault for being such a poof.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.753
So why don't you stop
whingeing and cheer the fuck up?

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.381
Eirik, I really
wouldn't respond.

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:16.725
I thought you wanted
the guy dead?

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.926
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.300
But it don't change the fact that he
stitched you up like a blind, little gay boy.

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.395
Does it?

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.332
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:35.435
Well?

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.513
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.572
He's a walking dead man.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.409
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory...

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.886
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:50.516
<i>"Ken, will you do me a favor and
become Ray's psychiatrist, please?"</i>

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:55.086
<i>No. What I think I asked you was, "Could
you go blow his fucking head off for me?"</i>

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:57.155
<i>"He's suicidal"?</i>

01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:00.724
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.998
We don't all keep
going on about it!

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:07.440
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:09.909
He put a loaded gun to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:12.503
He... What?
This gets fucking worse!

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.507
We were down in the park...

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:18.542
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.747
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:23.690
Let me get this right.
Not only have you refused to kill the boy,

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.954
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.290
which would have
solved my problem,

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.624
which would have
solved your problem,

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.597
which sounds like it would've
solved the boy's problem.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:32.293
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:36.326
Ken, if I had killed a little
kid, accidentally or otherwise,

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:37.633
I wouldn't have
thought twice.

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:40.231
I'd have killed myself on the fucking spot.
On the fucking spot.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.971
I'd have stuck the gun in
me mouth on the fucking spot!

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:46.674
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the capacity to change.

01:14:46.748 --> 01:14:49.216
The boy has the capacity to do
something decent with his life.

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:52.720
Excuse me, Ken. I have
the capacity to change.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:57.050
Yeah, you do. You've the
capacity to get fucking worse!

01:14:57.659 --> 01:15:00.150
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:02.129
Harry, let's face it.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.893
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:06.400
but you're a cunt.

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:09.301
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:13.102
And the only thing that's gonna change is
you're gonna become an even bigger cunt.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.665
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:16.836
Leave my kids fucking out of it.
What have they done?

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.346
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.678
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.447
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.512
I retracted it, didn't I?

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:31.750
Still leaves you
being a cunt.

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:34.387
Yeah, I fucking got that.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.575
Where's Ray now?

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.546
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:04.183
of the one million towns in mainland Europe
it's possible to be in, other than here.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.540
I'll get all the money back to you
soon as I get through to me friend.

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.201
It's not a problem,
Raymond.

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:24.939
And I'll get all your acid and
your ecstasy back to you, too.

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.537
English humor!

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:29.345
I'm assuming you've
got your gun on you.

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.522
That Yuri bloke's
a funny fella, isn't he?

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.750
He does yoga.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.353
<i>"The alcoves."</i>

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.759
Was he going on
to you about the alcoves?

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:44.964
<i>"The alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park."</i>

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:56.867
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.810
It's a bit crowded
round here, you know?

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.177
Well, I'm not gonna
have a shootout

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:02.739
in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:08.378
Not to mention the other
nationalities, just on their holidays.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.446
Hmm.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:13.058
To see the swans and the Gothic
and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:16.495
Are you trying to fucking wind me up?
- No, Harry.

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.965
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts.

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:22.003
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here.

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.298
Christ!

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.701
Let's go up the bell tower.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.973
Be quiet up there
this time of evening.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.708
Let's go up there.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.129
Yeah. Canadians.

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:59.134
I feel a bit bad.
They didn't kill John Lennon, did they?

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.675
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days.

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.767
Are you going to turn up?

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:03.868
Don't know.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:06.175
What have I got to
stay for really?

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:11.245
The most beautiful woman

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.581
you've ever seen

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:18.017
in all of your stupid life.

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.503
The tower is closed
this evening.

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:32.767
No way. It's supposed
to be open till 7:00.

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.934
The tower is usually
open until 7:00.

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.740
Yesterday an American had
a heart attack up the tower.

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:39.212
Today the tower is closed.

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:43.274
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you.
We're only gonna be 20 minutes.

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:54.588
The tower is closed
this evening.

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:56.995
Understand, Englishman?

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.295
Jimmy, I've been
wanting to say

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:41.638
I'm really sorry for
karate-chopping you the other night.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.076
That was way out of order.

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:48.776
You know, Ray, I'd find it easier
to believe and forgive you, somehow,

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:53.947
if the two of you weren't laughing
straight in my fucking face!

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.990
It's for the
goddamn movie, man.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.656
It is a nice town, Harry.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.292
I'm glad I got to see it.

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:16.637
I didn't mean to be taking the piss
out of it being a fairytale place.

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:18.542
It is a fairytale place.

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.976
It really is.
Hmm.

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:22.877
It's just a shame
it's in Belgium, really.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:26.318
But then you figure if it wasn't in
Belgium, if it was somewhere good,

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:30.518
there'd be too many people coming to
see it. It would spoil the whole thing.

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:35.291
Well, I'm glad
I got to see it

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:38.622
before I died.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.503
What are you doing?

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.943
What are you
fucking doing?

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.842
I'm not fighting
anymore, Harry.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:55.978
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.311
Don't come over all Gandhi.
What are you fucking doing?

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.986
Ken, stop messing
about, please.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.119
Pick up your gun. I know
I'm going to beat you anyway

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.823
'cause you're a spaz, but...
Harry,

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:13.391
I'm totally in your debt.

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:19.466
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:21.972
I love you unreservedly
for all that.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.203
What?

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.908
For your integrity.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.440
For your honor.

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:30.750
I love you.

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:35.554
The boy had to be let go.

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.359
The boy had to be
given a chance.

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:46.323
<i>And if to do that, I had to say,
"Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you,</i>

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:51.134
<i>"and fuck everything that's gone on
between us," then that's what I had to do.</i>

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.597
But I'm not fighting you.

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:57.236
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.143
I accept it. Totally.

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.246
Oh, yeah?

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:07.646
Yeah.

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:17.290
Well, you say all that fucking stuff,
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:21.158
It's entirely
up to you, Harry.

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:23.227
It's entirely your call.

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:27.639
All I'm saying is
I'm not fighting.

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:36.642
Oh, you fucking cunt!

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:37.946
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:41.819
just 'cause you're standing
about like Robert fucking Powell.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.352
Like who?
Like Robert fucking Powell

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:46.257
<i>out of Jesus of
fucking Nazareth!</i>

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.488
My fucking leg!

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:52.022
The psycho dwarf turns out to just
be a loveable little schoolboy,

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.625
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.193
Kiss my ass!

01:22:56.271 --> 01:23:00.435
I guess at least there weren't any
black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.075
I wasn't...

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.937
I wasn't talking about...

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:10.141
There's gonna be a war between
all the blacks and all the whites.

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.015
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.248
which would actually
be really good.

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.085
That's just cocaine.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.591
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.787
That's just cocaine.

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.460
Listen, we're filming down by
the pointy building tonight.

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:28.024
It might actually be
good for once.

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:31.464
You guys should come along.

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:36.272
We... I think we're just gonna
have a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:39.940
That's how it is!

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.542
In another life.

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.451
They're great,
aren't they?

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:10.100
You didn't. You didn't!

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:01.318
Mr. Waters? Mr. Waters?

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:06.289
Who's that?
It's Eirik.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.703
The blind boy?
Yeah.

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:12.366
Yes.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.538
What do you fucking want?

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.134
The guy you're looking for,

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:20.306
the guy Ray, he's
downstairs at the bar.

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:58.176
I'm sorry, Ken.

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:02.915
But you can't kill a kid and
expect to get away with it.

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:06.417
You just can't.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:24.404
Where?
To the left when you come out.

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:26.276
The bar to the left.

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.740
Ken!

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.382
Ken! Ken!

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.876
Harry's here.

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:56.181
What?

01:29:57.658 --> 01:29:58.852
Take

01:30:00.528 --> 01:30:01.790
my gun.

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:16.302
Ken?

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:18.936
Where's my gun?

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.507
Where's my gun?

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:28.649
I'm gonna die now, I think.

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.024
Oh, Ken!

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:35.155
Jesus!

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.357
Mr. Blakely said
you had left.

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.687
I need the key
to the room right now.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.284
Quickly, now!

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:50.357
And you gotta go home right now.
It's very, very dangerous here.

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.708
All right? Go home! Right now!

01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.921
Okay.

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:40.875
No, I won't let you up
there! Put that gun away, right now!

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.643
Lady, get out of
my fucking way, please.

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:45.811
No, I won't. I won't
get out of your way.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:48.177
You'll have to
go through me.

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:51.088
Well, obviously, I'm not gonna through
you, am I, with a baby and that?

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.182
I'm a nice person.

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.989
But could you just get out
of the fucking way, please?

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:01.494
Marie!

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.802
Just let him
come up, it's okay.

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:08.171
Harry, swear not to start shooting
until she's left the hotel.

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:11.643
I swear not to start shooting till
she's left the hotel. I totally swear.

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:14.180
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.409
This is my hotel.

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.247
So you can fuck off!

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:33.485
I suppose you've
got a gun up there?

01:34:33.486 --> 01:34:33.765
Yeah.

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:37.699
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.832
Why don't you both put
your guns down and go home?

01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:43.968
Don't be stupid.
This is the shootout.

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:48.740
Harry, I've got an idea.
What?

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:51.046
My room faces
onto the canal, right?

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.814
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

01:34:53.888 --> 01:34:55.981
see if I can swim to the
other side and escape.

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:58.287
Right. If you go outside
and round the corner,

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:00.725
you can shoot at me from
there and try and get me.

01:35:00.795 --> 01:35:03.263
That way, we leave this lady and her
baby out of the whole, entire thing.

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.662
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.530
I don't want to run out
there, come back in 10 minutes

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.159
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.533
I completely promise, Harry.

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:12.936
I'm not gonna risk having
another little kid die, am I?

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:17.171
So, hang on, I go outside, then
I go which way, right or left?

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:18.711
You go right,
don't you?

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.771
You can see it from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:24.818
All right. Jesus! I've only
just got here, haven't I?

01:35:24.885 --> 01:35:27.718
<i>Okay. On a count of
"one, two, three, go," okay?</i>

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:28.948
Okay.

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.159
What? Who says it?

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.629
Oh, you say it.

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.632
You guys are crazy.

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.099
Are you ready?
Ready.

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:42.692
Set?
Set.

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.567
One, two, three, go!

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:00.119
Keep driving!

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:09.527
No way. You're way
too far away.

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:14.050
The little boy.

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:15.179
That's right, Ray.

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:17.881
The little boy.

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:24.680
Oh.

01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:28.121
I see.

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:36.395
No, Harry.

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.928
He's not...

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:44.203
You've got to stick
to your principles.

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:12.367
<i>There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London</i>

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:16.341
<i>with a bunch of presents underneath
it that'll never be opened.</i>

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:20.970
<i>And I thought, "If I survive
all this, I'll go to that house,</i>

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.811
<i>"apologize to
the mother there,</i>

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:26.319
<i>"and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me."</i>

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:29.754
<i>Prison, death,
it didn't matter.</i>

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:34.390
<i>Because at least in prison and
at least in death, you know,</i>

01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:36.827
<i>I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.</i>

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:43.360
<i>But then, like a flash,
it came to me, and I realized,</i>

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:48.300
<i>"Fuck, man, maybe
that's what Hell is.</i>

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:53.209
<i>"The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!"</i>

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.918
<i>And I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:06.007
<i>I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

01:43:06.119 --> 01:43:07.119
