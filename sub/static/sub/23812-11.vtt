00:05.573 --> 00:07.239
This is so awesome!

00:07.341 --> 00:08.741
Sir Swayze is actually
coming here...

00:08.843 --> 00:10.242
to Astoria!

00:10.344 --> 00:11.443
Our land!

00:12.580 --> 00:14.313
Oh, but he's
coming all the way

00:14.415 --> 00:16.347
from the Kingdom
of Inwood.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.951
Oh, I hope he doesn't get
attacked by a monkey worm.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.185
Oh, please, okay?

00:20.287 --> 00:21.653
He's the greatest knight
in all of Astoria.

00:21.756 --> 00:24.189
He'd just punch that
monkey worm right in the mouth!

00:25.493 --> 00:28.160
We're excited
for Sir Swayze, too!

00:28.262 --> 00:30.429
Look at Sage. She's
smiling like a chucklehead.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.031
I am! I am!
I'm a happy chucklehead!

00:34.702 --> 00:37.069
I know we're
all fans of Sir Swayze.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.404
But when he arrives,

00:38.506 --> 00:40.205
let's have a little
self control.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.976
Oh, he's coming!
He's coming!

00:48.983 --> 00:51.817
Who's crazy for Swayze?

00:54.155 --> 00:57.189
As a gift to Astoria,
I will show you

00:57.291 --> 01:00.225
my legendary
pinky power punch.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.862
Sway... ze!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.369
He destroyed
my favorite cart,

01:10.471 --> 01:11.737
and I don't
even care!

01:11.839 --> 01:13.439
Woo, Sir Swayze!

01:21.449 --> 01:24.716
I heard Sir Swayze has
his own battle unicorn.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.118
I heard he survived

01:26.220 --> 01:27.653
a face-to-face battle
against Ryker.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.855
I heard Sir Gareth kicked
him out of knight school...

01:29.957 --> 01:31.256
Because I did.

01:31.358 --> 01:34.593
Hey, did you kick him
out for being too awesome?

01:34.695 --> 01:37.396
Because I'm worried I might
have that same problem.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.399
I kicked him
out because

01:40.501 --> 01:41.967
he never wanted
to do the work.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.402
He only wanted to
take shortcuts.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.471
So, how did he become
a Knight of Inwood?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.973
Well, Inwood lets
anyone become a knight.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.475
They even knighted
his dog.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.844
They call him
Sir Barksalot.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.047
I can't wait till
Sir Swayze leaves.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.215
Great news!

01:56.317 --> 01:58.050
Sir Swayze's not leaving.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.854
It's true.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.189
I'm staying to open
the Sir Swayze Knight Academy.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.724
Ohhhh...

02:05.826 --> 02:08.160
Swayze, this kingdom
already has a knight school.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.294
Oh, unclench your
metal butt, Sir G.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.933
My academy is nothing
like your school.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.236
My classes are at night.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.239
Wow. Knight school
at night?

02:20.341 --> 02:21.940
It just makes sense.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.078
Anyone interested
should meet me here tonight.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.679
The first students
to sign up

02:27.781 --> 02:30.149
get their very own
Swayze clip-on tail,

02:30.251 --> 02:32.217
trademark,
Swayze Enterprises.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.854
If we train with
Sir Gareth and Sir Swayze,

02:35.956 --> 02:37.189
we'll be doubly amazing.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.993
It's
gonna be so great!

02:41.095 --> 02:43.162
Except it's
never gonna happen.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.664
My students are forbidden
to attend his school.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.467
But can we go
to his academy?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.803
I withdraw
my question.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.777
Hello, candy.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.078
Goodbye, candy.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.680
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

03:04.218 --> 03:05.450
Mom and Dad left
me in charge

03:05.553 --> 03:06.752
of watching you
while they're gone,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.587
and they don't
want you eating candy.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.122
Hand it over.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.824
Fine.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.527
And your secret stash.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.801
Okay, if you're gonna eat
candy out of your boots,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.436
at least wear socks.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.006
Warwick,
Klutzy the Juggler

03:28.108 --> 03:29.508
is performing
in the Tasty Trunk.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.109
You shut your
giant mouth.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.844
We are so there.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.313
I wanna go.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.181
Oh, sorry, you can't.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.717
Klutzy juggles insanely
dangerous stuff.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.519
Like poisonous swords,
poisonous frogs.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.821
And sometimes just
straight up poison.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.326
Aw, man, the show's
tomorrow night.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.294
I can't go.
I'm watching Fizz.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.896
Take me with
you, please?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.498
You can watch me
watch the show.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.235
Sorry, you have
to be at least

03:56.337 --> 03:57.769
13 years old
to go, Fizz.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.004
It's a good rule.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.507
Last year, some guy took
a poisonous frog to the face.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.743
Please let it
be me this year.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.146
Sorry, bro.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.183
Hey, if a juggling
show is what you want,

04:11.285 --> 04:13.085
maybe I could do it.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.020
I'll start with
these hatchets.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.356
No!

04:22.997 --> 04:24.963
Sir Swayze's academy
started last night

04:25.065 --> 04:26.398
and we missed it.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.001
He never said my name,

04:29.103 --> 04:31.003
but I felt like
he knew my name,

04:31.105 --> 04:33.272
you know,
like in his soul.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.575
His soul is so cool!

04:36.677 --> 04:38.310
Why can't
Sir Gareth be cool?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.779
What is up,
my peeps?

04:43.484 --> 04:46.852
Mind if I chill
and, um, rap to ya?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.089
I think
he's lost his mind.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.324
Yeah.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.959
I'm so glad
I'm here to see it.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.429
I know you wanna train
with a cool teacher.

04:57.531 --> 05:02.200
Well, guess who's cooler
than an ice troll in winter?

05:02.303 --> 05:04.169
G Diddy.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.342
Today...

05:10.444 --> 05:12.444
I've got a little
surprise for you.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.882
I'ma teach you how to put
a smack down on a mummy.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.150
Yeah!

05:18.252 --> 05:19.451
In six months,

05:19.553 --> 05:22.187
after you read all of
these superfly books.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.490
Wow, congrats.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.492
You found a way
to make mummies boring.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.763
Yeah, what gives,
G Diddy?

05:31.865 --> 05:34.833
Oh, relax. It's
only a thousand pages.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.502
And I will catch you
on the flippity fly.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.240
No, I want to
fight a mummy,

05:42.343 --> 05:44.776
not read "Your Mummy
Or Your Life:

05:44.878 --> 05:47.646
13,000 Steps To
Defeating a Mummy."

05:49.350 --> 05:50.615
Well, come on, Prudy.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.517
Maybe there's something
in these books

05:52.619 --> 05:54.419
that can help us sneak Fizz
into that juggling show.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.822
You just want me to
carry your book, don't you?

05:56.924 --> 05:59.524
Yeah. It looks dusty
and you know I have allergies.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.597
Hey! You have
a Swayze tail in your pocket!

06:05.699 --> 06:06.998
I do?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.567
Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:08.669 --> 06:10.836
You two went
to his class.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.573
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.209
Remember? We
secretly signed up.

06:17.311 --> 06:18.543
There were only
two spots left,

06:18.645 --> 06:21.146
and you said, "Don't
tell Arc and Ciara."

06:22.516 --> 06:24.116
That sounds like
something I would say.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.450
Let's go.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.354
Okay, if Sage
and Buttercup

06:29.456 --> 06:30.822
are studying
under Sir Swayze,

06:30.924 --> 06:32.924
their new skills are
gonna put Kraken Squad on top.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.193
Which means they'll
become knights over us.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.395
We have to join
that class.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.063
Anything to get
one of those ponytails!

06:40.067 --> 06:42.501
And become knights.
Okay, that was implied.

Two people trying to
get better than us.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.105
Newsflash!

07:20.207 --> 07:21.840
The battle dummy's
better than you.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.144
Sir Swayze taught us
how to talk smack.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.047
One of the buttons
on your shirt is loose.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.382
If you want,

07:30.484 --> 07:32.984
I can take it
home and fix it.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.453
Boom!

07:38.358 --> 07:41.026
Welcome
to the first night

07:41.128 --> 07:43.094
of the rest of
your knights' lives.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.298
Pow! Wordplay!

07:46.400 --> 07:50.402
We are so excited
to train with you.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.370
Oh, what do
we do, first?

07:52.473 --> 07:54.406
Please tell me it's
not reading a book.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.274
The only thing
I ever got from a book

07:56.376 --> 07:57.776
was a paper cut.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.345
So, I punched that book
and fed it to my battle unicorn.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.116
"Feed books
to unicorns."

08:05.219 --> 08:07.719
See, this is
the academy difference.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.423
Sir Swayze, any
chance you could teach us

08:11.525 --> 08:14.025
how to defeat a mummy
in less than six months?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.760
Sage, there's no
way he can do that.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.263
- I can totally do that.
- Told you, Sage.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.800
I was a survivor
of The Great Mummy Invasion.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.269
I can teach you how to
defeat a mummy in no time...

08:24.371 --> 08:26.705
With my pinky
power punch.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.507
Oh, quick question.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.877
When are we gonna
get our Swayze tails?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.578
They're already on you.

08:39.919 --> 08:40.885
How did he do that?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.722
I don't know, but
I am learning so much.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.627
All right, Fizz,
we have a way to make you

08:48.729 --> 08:50.595
look older, so you
can see Klutzy.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.664
Neckties!

08:53.867 --> 08:57.102
Nothing says old dude
like a soup-stained necktie.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.237
Or we can use a spell

08:59.339 --> 09:01.506
I found in Warwick's
magic book.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.511
Huh?

09:06.613 --> 09:08.113
This spell creates
a magic pocket watch

09:08.215 --> 09:09.514
that can change
your age.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.283
What are you
waiting for?

09:11.385 --> 09:12.951
Make me a man!

09:16.256 --> 09:17.589
Cronos pendulum fon!

09:19.159 --> 09:21.059
All right, you can
make yourself older

09:21.161 --> 09:22.294
by turning
the watch forward.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.662
Then after the show,
turn it back,

09:23.764 --> 09:25.397
and you'll be
normal again.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.140
It works!

09:35.242 --> 09:36.541
You know what
else works?

09:36.643 --> 09:39.377
This sweet,
sweet stache!

09:43.850 --> 09:44.616
Like a momma bird,

09:44.718 --> 09:46.351
I chewed up
the awesomest worm

09:46.453 --> 09:48.253
and spat it...

09:48.355 --> 09:50.055
into your mouths,

09:50.157 --> 09:52.324
making you awesome, too.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.826
You know what?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.795
Sir Gareth never spits
awesomeness into our mouths.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.398
Now you all know how
to take down a mummy

10:00.500 --> 10:02.100
using the pinky
power punch.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.602
Unleash your pinkies.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.975
Sway... ze!

10:11.678 --> 10:13.979
Woo-hoo! Yes!
I am such a good teacher!

10:15.515 --> 10:16.448
You guys stay here.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.350
I have something
very special for you.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.019
Please, be a bunny!
Please, be a bunny!

10:24.491 --> 10:27.592
Now I will give you
the most handsome shield

10:27.694 --> 10:29.427
in all the five
kingdoms.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.737
They're to let everyone
know you're my students.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.872
Well, everyone
except Sir Gareth.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.241
If he finds out we're here,
it's not gonna be pretty.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.809
So, I shouldn't have
called him down here

10:44.911 --> 10:47.278
to see how much better my
academy is than his school?

10:47.381 --> 10:48.480
What?!

10:48.582 --> 10:50.015
Swayze!

10:50.117 --> 10:51.282
He's coming!

10:51.385 --> 10:52.817
Let's hide!

10:56.523 --> 11:00.458
Ha, so you call
this sad display an academy?

11:00.560 --> 11:03.028
It has no heart.
It has no guts.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.863
It has no...
Ooh, spa water.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.366
That's nice. Hm.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.268
As I was saying!

11:10.370 --> 11:11.703
This academy's a joke.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.005
My star students don't
seem to think so.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.677
Who would be dumb enough
to train under you?

11:18.779 --> 11:21.613
It's definitely not Buttercup,
Sage, Arc and Ciara.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.148
Right, guys?

11:25.952 --> 11:28.386
He-e-e-ey, G Diddy.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.556
I can't believe you went
behind my back like this,

11:31.658 --> 11:34.125
after I specifically
told you not to!

11:34.227 --> 11:37.462
Sir Gareth, we're just trying
to become great knights.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.130
And you thought
that disobeying me

11:39.232 --> 11:40.665
was the way
to achieve that.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.768
I've never been
more disappointed.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.171
All of you to the training
yard for your punishment.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.572
Right now!

11:52.412 --> 11:53.611
Not you!

12:01.521 --> 12:03.021
What are we doing
with all this dirt?

12:03.123 --> 12:05.423
I thought our punishment
was cleaning the training yard.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.658
Oh, it is.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.992
But this place
isn't dirty enough.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.628
So, you're going
to take this dirt

12:10.731 --> 12:13.698
and spread it around
and then clean it all up!

12:13.800 --> 12:16.167
Yay, it's like
a big sandbox!

12:17.771 --> 12:20.171
Oh, no, it's like
a big sandbox.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.742
This isn't fair.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.211
Buttercup and I were only
in Sir Swayze's academy

12:26.313 --> 12:29.814
to stop Phoenix Squad from
making bad life decisions.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.584
No, we made our
bad life decisions

12:32.686 --> 12:34.252
after they made
their bad life decisions.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.020
Uh! Enough!

12:36.123 --> 12:39.457
I know why you were there
and you're wasting your time.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.860
Sir Swayze's shortcuts
will only hurt

12:41.962 --> 12:44.062
your chances of
becoming knights.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.530
Not true, okay?

12:45.632 --> 12:48.399
He spat awesome worms
into our mouths.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.135
It sounds better
when he says it.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.139
Sir Swayze taught us
how to defeat a mummy

12:54.241 --> 12:55.406
without opening a book.

12:55.509 --> 12:56.541
That's impossible!

12:56.643 --> 12:57.909
You cannot defeat a mummy

12:58.011 --> 12:59.577
without knowing
everything in these books.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.012
No! Now get
this place dirty

13:01.114 --> 13:02.814
so you can make
it clean again!

13:05.218 --> 13:07.018
Hey, I wish we could
show Sir Gareth

13:07.120 --> 13:09.187
we're not wasting our
time with Sir Swayze.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.356
I have an idea.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.792
How about we wake
the mummy

13:13.894 --> 13:16.995
and use the pinky
power punch to take it down?

13:17.097 --> 13:20.632
Oh, then Sir Gareth would see
Sir Swayze's an awesome teacher,

13:20.734 --> 13:22.400
and let us keep
training with him.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.570
Good plan, Ciara.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.305
It was my plan.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.308
I'm pretty
sure it was Ciara's.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.548
We're finally
gonna see Klutzy.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.383
I know. I brought
my first aid kit

13:38.485 --> 13:40.685
for when the poison
starts flying.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.622
Excuse me, you're
blocking the stage.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.990
Can you take off
your hat?

13:46.092 --> 13:47.258
Oh, sure.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.730
Can you take off
your hair?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.167
Forget it.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.702
I'll just use the watch

13:57.804 --> 13:59.270
to make myself older
and taller.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.173
Okay. Go ahead and give
yourself a couple of years.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.879
How do I look?

14:10.750 --> 14:13.751
Whoa, you look
like Pop Pop.

14:13.854 --> 14:17.121
I feel like
Pop Pop, too.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.491
My bladder's the size
of a peanut.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.193
Ooh, I gotta tinkle.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.398
Okay, we've
got a problem.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.933
If he's anything
like Pop Pop,

14:29.035 --> 14:30.401
he'll be farting
throughout the show.

14:30.503 --> 14:35.106
And also your little
brother's a senior citizen!

14:35.208 --> 14:38.009
Yeah, you're right.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.078
We should get
a discount.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.747
No! You need to tell
him to change back.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.148
You're still
his older brother,

14:44.251 --> 14:46.718
even though you're
60 years younger.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.186
False alarm.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.321
My bladder's playin'
tricks on me.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.459
Fizz, we have
to turn you back.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.028
Darn tooting
we should.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.098
Oh, I'm even
talking old.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.602
Okay, where's
the watch?

15:04.704 --> 15:06.504
I don't know.
It was here a minute ago.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.772
Wait, you lost it?

15:07.874 --> 15:09.407
You were only gone
for ten seconds.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.075
I was?
Where'd I go?

15:16.549 --> 15:19.417
So, how do
we wake a mummy?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.952
Tummy tickles.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.787
All we have to do

15:22.889 --> 15:25.356
is read the incantation
on top of the sarcophagus.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.724
How do you know that?

15:26.826 --> 15:28.126
I have weird
hobbies, okay?

15:29.829 --> 15:31.796
Buddybutt, get
the magic mirror ready.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.431
Oh...

15:33.533 --> 15:35.566
And action!

15:35.669 --> 15:37.568
Sir Gareth,
we're recording this

15:37.671 --> 15:39.003
as proof that Sir Swayze

15:39.105 --> 15:41.439
taught us how to send
a mummy back to its mommy.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.844
And now, I will read
the ancient incantation.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.717
Wakey-wakey,
eggs 'n bakey!

15:52.819 --> 15:55.086
That can't be it.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.123
I was wrong.
Please continue.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.663
Normally, we'd be
pretty terrified.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.465
But we know this mummy
is no threat to us

16:07.567 --> 16:10.835
because Sir Swayze taught
us his pinky power punch.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.304
Let's do it.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.276
Sway... ze!

16:19.980 --> 16:22.080
You guys really
showed him!

16:22.182 --> 16:24.148
The mummy has
mystical powers!

16:26.052 --> 16:28.386
Let's go get Sir Swayze!
Come on!

16:28.488 --> 16:29.587
Oh, man...

16:29.689 --> 16:30.955
it wasn't recording.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.191
Can we start over,
Mr. Eggs 'n Bakey?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.666
Seventy-nine...

16:41.768 --> 16:44.035
eighty...

16:44.137 --> 16:45.503
eighty-one...

16:45.605 --> 16:47.005
Oh! Oh! Oh!

16:49.009 --> 16:50.008
Mummy!
Attacking!

16:50.110 --> 16:52.076
- My idea!
- Eggs 'n bakey!

16:52.178 --> 16:54.579
We wanted to prove you
were a great teacher,

16:54.681 --> 16:55.913
so we woke up a mummy.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.281
We tried your
pinky power punch,

16:57.384 --> 16:58.916
but the mummy
has mystical powers.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.019
So, now we need you
to take it out for us.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.087
So, stop brushing
your amazing Swayze tail.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.789
Okay, so there is
a mummy loose?

17:04.891 --> 17:06.424
Oh, this is bad.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.291
Like we should tell
the teacher bad.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.694
But... but you're
our teacher.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.996
I know!
That's why I'm freaking out!

17:12.098 --> 17:14.031
Uh, help me pack
the spa water.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.098
I'm outta here!

17:15.201 --> 17:16.601
But it's
just one mummy.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.169
You survived
The Great Mummy Invasion.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.537
I survived because
I ran away

17:19.638 --> 17:22.240
while they ate
my battle unicorn.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.708
You're
a legendary knight.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.044
No, a legendary phony
and that pinky power punch

17:26.146 --> 17:27.744
only works on carts
and battle dummies.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.216
Why would you open
a knight academy

17:32.318 --> 17:34.218
if you're just a big
old chicken man baby?

17:36.923 --> 17:38.156
Because Sir Gareth
embarrassed me

17:38.258 --> 17:39.724
when he kicked me out.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.159
I wanted to
embarrass him back

17:41.261 --> 17:42.994
by taking all
his students.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.595
No disrespect,
Sir Swayze,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.764
but that's not why
you go into teaching.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.935
Hey, so what are
we gonna do now?

17:51.037 --> 17:52.637
Well...

17:52.739 --> 17:54.906
I do know
one more move.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.275
The Swayze Sprint!

17:57.377 --> 17:59.077
Oh!

18:00.747 --> 18:02.713
You're still
my students! Save me!

18:05.185 --> 18:08.252
Mommy!

18:10.023 --> 18:11.389
If that thing
puts Sir Swayze

18:11.491 --> 18:13.191
in a sarcophagus, he'll
be turned into a mummy.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.492
How do you know that?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.594
I told you I have
weird hobbies.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.335
Okay, we'd better
find that watch,

18:24.437 --> 18:25.903
or Fizz will
be old forever.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.271
Come on, Fizz,
help us look.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.173
I can't get off
of this chair

18:29.275 --> 18:31.142
on account of
my sciatica.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.512
What's a sciatica?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.780
I don't know.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.183
I'm doomed, Prudy.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.952
All I had to
do was watch him

18:41.054 --> 18:43.387
and keep him
from eating candy.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.490
Wait, candy.
Wait, that's it.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.792
Well, I could use a snack,
but now's not the time.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.862
No, he hides things
in his boot.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.497
Maybe the watch
is in there, too.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.998
Get off of me!

18:54.100 --> 18:55.900
Man, my brother gave
me these boots!

18:57.270 --> 18:58.469
I am your brother!

19:00.940 --> 19:04.041
Whoa. Fizz, you put
the watch in your candy boot.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.343
Oh, yeah.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.346
Uh, see if my tuna
sandwich is in there, too.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.284
Change him back before he puts
anything else in that boot.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.320
But if I turn
back into a kid,

19:16.422 --> 19:17.688
you'll get kicked out.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.090
I don't care.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.858
I just want
my little brother back.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.194
You are the best
big brother

19:23.296 --> 19:25.963
this old fool
ever had.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.569
Ha. Ha. Ha.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.473
Goodbye, sciatica!

19:37.143 --> 19:38.876
I'm young again!

19:38.978 --> 19:43.381
My shoulder's stopped
making that clicking noise.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.615
Glad you're back

19:44.717 --> 19:46.417
and maybe the bouncer
won't know you're here.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.486
Who let this kid in?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.321
You three are
outta here!

19:50.423 --> 19:51.689
Oh, but
the good news is

19:51.791 --> 19:55.259
we can always see
Klutzy's show next year.

19:56.663 --> 20:01.933
Welcome to Klutzy
the Juggler's final show... ever!

20:03.102 --> 20:04.569
No-o-o-o-o-o!

20:08.141 --> 20:09.840
Please let me go.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.309
No.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.712
He's taking him
down to Mummy Town!

20:14.814 --> 20:17.448
Stop pulling me
by my Swayze tail!

20:17.550 --> 20:19.517
I know how
to fix this.

20:19.619 --> 20:20.851
Let's read all
these books,

20:20.954 --> 20:23.154
then in six months,
we can kick his butt.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.057
Or we can do this.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.833
He hates books
as much as we do.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.907
Sir Swayze,
do something!

20:43.009 --> 20:44.208
I'm doing two things...

20:44.310 --> 20:46.711
Crying and hoping
he eats you, first.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.482
It looks like this
is the end, guys.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.456
Sir Gareth!

20:58.558 --> 21:01.626
Save us!
I'm useless!

21:01.728 --> 21:04.028
Stand back, students,
and former student...

21:04.130 --> 21:05.563
Who I can't stand.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.270
Oh! How are you
doing that?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.472
Well, if you would
have read the book,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.240
you would know that
a crystal-charged weapon

21:16.342 --> 21:19.277
can absorb
the mummy's power.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.478
And then you
can do this!

21:24.584 --> 21:25.983
Whoa...

21:27.253 --> 21:30.321
Mm-hm. Told ya you
had a cool teacher.

21:31.758 --> 21:35.059
And that is how
you defeat a mummy.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.861
Pow!

21:36.963 --> 21:38.729
Teamwork!

21:38.831 --> 21:40.298
Just go.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.766
- Probably for the best.
- Yeah.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.935
Sir Gareth, we should
have listened to you

21:45.038 --> 21:46.604
about Sir Swayze.

21:46.706 --> 21:50.041
We know that there's no
shortcuts to becoming a knight.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.342
We're sorry.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.943
How did you know
how to find us?

21:53.046 --> 21:55.146
You butt dialed me.

21:55.248 --> 21:58.215
Yay! My butt's a hero!

21:58.318 --> 21:59.650
<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>
