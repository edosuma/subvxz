WEBVTT

00:05.440 --> 00:07.405
Oh, come on. You gotta get up.

00:07.406 --> 00:09.270
I've been trying to
wake you up since 7:00.

00:09.271 --> 00:10.897
Mm. I don't wanna get up.

00:10.898 --> 00:12.473
All right.

00:12.474 --> 00:15.728
Then I'm coming in. Oh!

00:16.101 --> 00:17.846
Oh, not now. I have a headache.

00:17.847 --> 00:19.086
You have a headache?

00:19.087 --> 00:20.781
- Yeah. 
- Can't you wait till we're married

00:20.782 --> 00:22.425
For you to bust that one out?

00:22.426 --> 00:25.425
Some people get real
headaches. Oh, really?

00:25.426 --> 00:28.494
I don't know. Maybe
I still have the flu.

00:29.087 --> 00:31.442
You've been in bed for a week.

00:31.443 --> 00:33.005
Do you want to skip my
mom's benefit tonight?

00:33.006 --> 00:34.903
No. God, no.I need to
get outta the house.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.530
I'm so bored.

00:36.531 --> 00:38.826
Well, you wanna know
what dr. Walker thinks?

00:38.827 --> 00:40.852
No. Come on. I'm taking
clinical diagnosis.

00:40.853 --> 00:45.426
Let me try. Let me try. All right.

00:45.427 --> 00:48.126
Uh... No fever.

00:48.127 --> 00:51.193
Could it be ojai food poisoning?

00:51.194 --> 00:54.025
Or idiopathic
wedding-plan-itis?

00:54.026 --> 00:55.804
Wedding-plan-itis?
Mm-hmm.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.672
Don't you have to get
to school or something?

00:58.673 --> 01:00.792
Oh, I do.

01:00.793 --> 01:02.723
I love you. All right.

01:02.724 --> 01:05.197
Look, if you don't feel
better, call me, all right?

01:05.197 --> 01:07.842
Get up.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.672
They cut our line of
credit in half? Why?

01:10.673 --> 01:12.319
Because everything
else in the neighborhood

01:12.320 --> 01:13.082
Is selling for less...

01:13.083 --> 01:14.573
So our place is less valuable.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.234
God, I hate banks. All
they care about is money.

01:17.235 --> 01:18.353
How much did they leave us?

01:18.354 --> 01:21.743
Uh, $50,000, which is not
enough to pay for this baby.

01:21.744 --> 01:23.133
Just getting michelle
approved as our surrogate

01:23.134 --> 01:25.458
And the screening alone
was close to 5 grand.

01:25.459 --> 01:27.848
Well, you know, fine.
I will--I'll cater more.

01:27.849 --> 01:30.085
Cater? We're talking $50,000.

01:30.086 --> 01:31.610
Well, I'll cater a lot if I have to.

01:31.611 --> 01:34.153
Well, what am I supposed to do,
steal campaign contributions?

01:34.154 --> 01:36.715
It'd be money better spent.
Oh, if you think robert's bad,

01:36.716 --> 01:39.020
Wait till you see this
nut job barry henderson

01:39.021 --> 01:40.952
Who's entering the primary today.

01:40.953 --> 01:43.495
He'd cut our line of
credit just for being gay.

01:43.496 --> 01:44.868
Well, what are we supposed to do?

01:44.869 --> 01:46.193
We've come this far. I
don't want to give up just--

01:46.194 --> 01:48.599
I will talk to another bank
and I will get us this loan.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.955
I promise.

01:49.956 --> 01:52.955
Ugh. I gotta run. My phone's
been buzzing all morning

01:52.956 --> 01:56.108
'Cause of this henderson
dude. Did you just say "dude"?

01:56.109 --> 01:57.193
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

01:59.194 --> 02:01.569
Call the police! There's
an insane man outside!

02:01.570 --> 02:03.721
No, kevin, kevin, that's
kluve the crusader. Who?!

02:03.722 --> 02:06.348
That's my father wearing his
kluve the crusader costume.

02:06.349 --> 02:07.281
Kluve?

02:07.282 --> 02:09.721
From planet kluven.

02:09.722 --> 02:13.494
Just let him in.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.487
Hi, wally. Hi, kevin.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.894
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare ya.

02:23.895 --> 02:25.592
Hi, dad.

02:25.593 --> 02:26.812
Hi, son.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.159
Wow. Hey, I-I see the--
the costume still fits.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.965
There's a comic convention in town,

02:31.966 --> 02:34.558
So I thought I'd get it
out of the mothballs and go.

02:34.559 --> 02:36.456
It was kind of a last-minute thing.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.219
Where's, uh, where's mom?

02:38.220 --> 02:40.826
Um, she didn't want to come.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.476
Oh, yeah. Well, she never
loved kluve the way we did.

02:43.477 --> 02:47.103
No, she didn't. But, uh...

02:47.104 --> 02:48.951
Scotty...

02:48.952 --> 02:52.427
Your mother left me.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.191
- Mom? 
- Yeah.

02:56.192 --> 02:58.937
Have you seen my keys? I-I
let evan play with them,

02:58.938 --> 03:00.886
And then they just seem to migrate.

03:00.887 --> 03:04.228
Oh, thank you. And where my
last quarter contribution report

03:04.229 --> 03:07.160
Has migrated to, I do not know.

03:07.161 --> 03:09.567
Oh, well, you can't blame evan for that.

03:09.568 --> 03:12.593
Oh! Ooh, I'm gonna be late
for my meeting at the center

03:12.594 --> 03:14.593
About tonight's benefit.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.720
Oh, could I have picked

03:16.721 --> 03:19.248
A worse time to be raising money?

03:19.249 --> 03:20.994
Mom, did you know that perfectionists

03:20.995 --> 03:23.028
Have far more stress and conflict

03:23.029 --> 03:24.299
In their lives than--
you're telling me.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.706
I have convinced
myself--

03:25.707 --> 03:27.028
no one's coming tonight, no one.

03:27.029 --> 03:28.452
Mom, you need to lose the stress.

03:28.453 --> 03:31.167
The stress is going to deplete
your adrenaline reserves.

03:31.168 --> 03:32.251
Who needs adrenaline?

03:32.252 --> 03:33.878
I'm practically spinning like a top.

03:33.879 --> 03:36.082
Mom, the benefit is
gonna be great, okay?

03:36.083 --> 03:40.710
Now relax. Okay, now I will
be home in a couple of hours.

03:41.661 --> 03:45.361
Kitty? Kitty?

03:46.494 --> 03:47.322
Kitty?

03:47.323 --> 03:49.119
Um, don't you have your appointment

03:49.120 --> 03:51.898
With dr. Avadon today? Oh,
you know what? I canceled it.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.746
I--you know,
I just--

03:52.747 --> 03:54.831
I really want something
new for the benefit,

03:54.832 --> 03:56.342
So I'm gonna go shopping.

03:56.343 --> 03:58.359
Oh, well, what day did
you reschedule it for?

03:58.360 --> 03:59.461
Maybe I could go with you.

03:59.462 --> 04:00.817
You don't have to worry about it.

04:00.818 --> 04:03.495
Besides, you know, I'm just not so keen

04:03.496 --> 04:05.732
On dr. Avadon anymore.

04:05.733 --> 04:07.224
What--what
did she do?

04:07.225 --> 04:09.295
Do you want to find another doctor?

04:09.296 --> 04:10.769
No, no, no, it's not
that. She's--she's great.

04:10.770 --> 04:14.028
It's just, um...

04:14.029 --> 04:18.413
Well, I'm--I'm thinking
about some alternatives

04:18.414 --> 04:21.416
Instead of doing any more chemo.

04:21.993 --> 04:24.145
What?

04:24.146 --> 04:26.128
Are you insane? What
are you talking about?

04:26.129 --> 04:29.721
Mother, I... I really wish
you wouldn't freak out.

04:29.722 --> 04:31.959
Well, how do you expect me to react?

04:31.960 --> 04:33.755
Stopping chemo at this time

04:33.756 --> 04:35.504
Would be the worst
possible thing you could do.

04:35.505 --> 04:36.555
How do you know?

04:36.556 --> 04:38.690
Kitty, stop. Please.
You're frightening me.

04:38.691 --> 04:40.063
Before you say another word, mom,

04:40.064 --> 04:41.487
Remember that you weren't
the one sitting there

04:41.488 --> 04:43.895
With a bag full of poison
dripping into your arm,

04:43.896 --> 04:46.640
Shivering and--and trying
to get warm from the chills.

04:46.641 --> 04:47.862
And you weren't the one

04:47.863 --> 04:49.593
who was so jacked up on prednisone

04:49.594 --> 04:51.196
That you got up at 3:00 in the morning

04:51.197 --> 04:53.513
- And cleaned up the kitchen. 
- You were up all night?

04:53.514 --> 04:56.029
I didn't know that.

04:57.292 --> 04:59.529
Well, that's because you were sleeping.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.783
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

05:01.784 --> 05:03.084
Did you tell robert?

05:03.085 --> 05:05.941
No, mom. It doesn't make any difference.

05:05.942 --> 05:06.878
Yes, it does.

05:06.879 --> 05:08.878
We need to know what
you're going through

05:08.879 --> 05:11.395
- So we can help you. 
- Mom, you don't get it.

05:11.396 --> 05:16.163
The only one that can
help me now... Is me.

05:16.164 --> 05:19.211
That's not true,
kitty. That's not--

05:19.212 --> 05:21.656
Where are you going?

05:21.974 --> 05:22.847
Kitty?

05:24.000 --> 05:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:31.925 --> 05:33.543
I am so sorry I'm late.

05:33.544 --> 05:35.734
We got invaded by a
crazy man this morning.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.519
Yeah? So was the republican party.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.893
Barry henderson officially entered

05:39.894 --> 05:41.813
The primary for governor
five minutes ago.

05:41.814 --> 05:43.908
Yeah, I just heard him
barking on the radio.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.480
"we have to preserve our way of life,

05:45.481 --> 05:47.337
"return this great state
to the hard-working people

05:47.338 --> 05:48.924
Who created it"?

05:48.925 --> 05:50.416
I'm sure he's not
talking about mexicans.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.527
No. He's talking about
hard-working white people.

05:52.528 --> 05:54.559
What rock did he crawl out from under?

05:54.560 --> 05:57.257
The same one all these guys do.

05:57.258 --> 05:58.924
Coded racial messages...

05:58.925 --> 06:01.368
And it always works.
It's as old as nixon.

06:01.369 --> 06:02.273
Oh, you know he's sitting

06:02.274 --> 06:04.114
on the unemployment
symposium with you today?

06:04.115 --> 06:05.590
Yeah, I'm gonna eviscerate him.

06:05.591 --> 06:09.511
It's gonna be like
cage fighting in vegas.

06:09.512 --> 06:11.685
You have to ignore him,
okay? I'm being serious.

06:11.686 --> 06:12.962
You don't ignore a guy like that, Kevin.

06:12.963 --> 06:14.749
You beat him into submission.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.637
Great, and I would-- I
would love to see that,

06:16.638 --> 06:17.860
But that is counterproductive.

06:17.861 --> 06:19.479
You treat him like a
threat, he will become one.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.526
I know how to play him.

06:20.527 --> 06:22.288
Look, I don't want you to play anything.

06:22.289 --> 06:24.177
Let kern take care of him, okay?

06:24.178 --> 06:25.558
He's a bigger threat to her anyway.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.971
He's a threat to the entire nation.

06:26.972 --> 06:27.891
You attack him,

06:27.892 --> 06:29.415
you're gonna attack a
large part of the base.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.558
They will make him their
cause. Take the high road.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.388
Ignoring a racist is
taking the high road?

06:33.389 --> 06:35.388
I-i-it's--it's
practical.

06:35.389 --> 06:38.890
W-why are you so armed up, anyway?

06:39.130 --> 06:41.790
I've got a lot on my mind.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.526
I understand.

06:45.653 --> 06:49.322
So how do you think kitty's doing?

06:50.209 --> 06:52.684
As well as could be expected.

06:52.685 --> 06:53.684
Yeah.

06:53.685 --> 06:57.056
Yeah, me, too.

07:00.209 --> 07:01.239
So?

07:01.240 --> 07:03.668
Sarah, you can run these numbers
by me as often as you want.

07:03.669 --> 07:05.355
I just don't think
that this is gonna work.

07:05.356 --> 07:06.715
Saul, we gotta do something.

07:06.716 --> 07:08.779
The ojai revenues are in free fall.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.810
Okay, we create a second wine label,

07:10.811 --> 07:13.080
We call it diversification.
Call it rotgut.

07:13.081 --> 07:15.334
You know what's gonna happen, kiddo?

07:15.335 --> 07:16.747
You're gonna get drunk, have a hangover,

07:16.748 --> 07:17.874
And regret the whole thing.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.953
We're not drinking it. We're selling it.

07:19.954 --> 07:22.127
Look, believe me, this
is holly's project.

07:22.128 --> 07:24.159
As much as I'd like
to say it's a bad move,

07:24.160 --> 07:27.302
Right now, it's our only move.

07:27.303 --> 07:28.159
Come on, you guys.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.873
Is this an indoor game?

07:29.874 --> 07:32.857
Yeah, well, only when
you play it indoors.

07:32.858 --> 07:34.889
Uh, clearly, it is not an indoor game.

07:34.890 --> 07:36.413
Paige, cooper, you
think I can keep this up

07:36.414 --> 07:37.873
- All the way to the door?  
- Let's see.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.795
Ready?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.065
Maybe I should've left him at mom's.

07:44.066 --> 07:45.587
What is all this trepidation about?

07:45.588 --> 07:47.793
Everybody loves this
guy. The kids love him.

07:47.794 --> 07:50.079
Yeah, that's because he acts like a kid.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.269
Well, that's okay.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.000
We're not done.

07:56.001 --> 07:58.666
Hi, mom. Listen, I'm with
saul. Can I call you back?

07:58.667 --> 08:01.015
No, sarah. Listen, I need your help.

08:01.016 --> 08:04.237
Kitty says she might not
do her next round of chemo.

08:04.238 --> 08:05.444
What did you say to her?

08:05.445 --> 08:08.348
It doesn't matter what I
say. She won't listen to me.

08:08.349 --> 08:10.046
And besides, I had to
leave and go to this meeting

08:10.047 --> 08:11.365
About the benefit tonight.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.030
Sarah, please, please,

08:13.031 --> 08:14.919
would you go over there and talk to her?

08:14.920 --> 08:15.872
Of course I will.

08:15.873 --> 08:18.602
I'll come-- I'll come
over right now, okay?

08:18.603 --> 08:20.935
Good. Don't leave the
house until you convince her

08:20.936 --> 08:22.871
- To go back to dr. Avadon. 
- I won't.

08:22.872 --> 08:26.190
Okay. Thank you.

08:27.142 --> 08:29.189
This is some kind of place, chef.

08:29.190 --> 08:30.593
You've come a long way.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.284
Well, you knew me when
I was sleeping in my car.

08:33.284 --> 08:37.027
I knew when you were
sleeping in your crib.

08:40.727 --> 08:43.347
Dad, I'm really sorry about mom.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.188
I didn't mean to blurt it out like that.

08:45.189 --> 08:47.648
I must have looked like
such an idiot in that outfit.

08:47.649 --> 08:49.251
Oh, stop it. You looked awesome.

08:49.252 --> 08:51.377
I brought my
entire collection--

08:51.378 --> 08:53.059
all the old "daredevil" comics,

08:53.060 --> 08:54.823
"the avengers," "captain america,"

08:54.824 --> 08:56.521
"the amazing spider-man."

08:56.522 --> 09:00.616
I think I might sell them
under the circumstances.

09:00.617 --> 09:02.267
Dad, tell me what happened.

09:02.268 --> 09:03.537
It's complicated, scotty.

09:03.538 --> 09:06.330
This wasn't about me
being... Gay, was it?

09:06.331 --> 09:09.061
- No, no. - Well, I know mom
can be very stubborn sometimes--

09:09.062 --> 09:11.493
Look, we just started drifting apart.

09:11.494 --> 09:13.362
That's all.

09:13.363 --> 09:14.774
Sometimes these things can be a chance

09:14.775 --> 09:18.027
For people to start over.

09:19.728 --> 09:22.460
Actually, I, um...

09:22.461 --> 09:26.599
I have some pretty important
news to tell you about myself.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.806
Kevin's pregnant, right?

09:29.807 --> 09:32.774
Uh, no, um, but...

09:32.775 --> 09:36.695
A-actually, it's--it's kinda
crazy you should say that.

09:36.696 --> 09:40.409
Um... We're trying to have a baby.

09:40.410 --> 09:41.567
How are you, uh...

09:41.568 --> 09:43.377
Um, well, we're gonna
go with a surrogate.

09:43.378 --> 09:45.726
That is, if we can afford
one. It costs a fortune.

09:45.727 --> 09:48.837
Wait a minute. Which of you is gonna...

09:48.838 --> 09:51.660
- I mean, whose... 
- Sperm are we going to use?

09:51.661 --> 09:53.646
Yeah. Dad, it isn't a competition.

09:53.647 --> 09:58.472
I know. Can't a grandfather dream?

09:58.473 --> 10:02.094
Yes, he can.

10:04.710 --> 10:05.820
What are you doing?

10:05.821 --> 10:07.392
I'm unpacking a grocery bag.

10:07.393 --> 10:10.059
Mom's right. You can't stop chemo.

10:10.060 --> 10:13.376
I never said I was going
to stop chemo, sarah.

10:13.377 --> 10:15.894
I just said that I was thinking
about going another way.

10:15.895 --> 10:17.391
What is all this stuff?

10:17.392 --> 10:20.550
Um, flaxseed oil, herbs, vitamins.

10:20.551 --> 10:22.503
Oh, my god. Should I
light a scented candle

10:22.504 --> 10:24.518
And put on some sitar music?

10:24.519 --> 10:27.217
Wh-what--kitty, what
is happening to you?

10:27.218 --> 10:30.280
- I have lymphoma. That's what's happening.
- Exactly.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.544
And you did a lot of research

10:31.545 --> 10:32.851
and you chose the best doctor

10:32.852 --> 10:34.375
And you chose the best treatment.

10:34.376 --> 10:36.185
Nobody knows what the best treatment is.

10:36.186 --> 10:38.137
So now you're gonna
choose to do nothing?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.343
No, but chemo is not the only option.

10:40.344 --> 10:42.533
I ran into mary wadsworth the other day.

10:42.534 --> 10:45.740
She's this woman who did a
magazine profile on robert and me,

10:45.741 --> 10:47.692
And she was lymphoma type ii,

10:47.693 --> 10:49.692
And now she's in complete remission.

10:49.693 --> 10:51.343
And she stopped chemo.

10:51.344 --> 10:53.676
She did. She thought that
it was poisoning her body,

10:53.677 --> 10:56.422
And she decided to believe
in the power of her own mind,

10:56.423 --> 10:57.628
In alternative treatments.

10:57.629 --> 11:00.597
She didn't even lose
her hair. She's me--

11:00.598 --> 11:03.343
Type-a, driven
personality, stressed out--

11:03.344 --> 11:06.025
Wait, if you're blaming
yourself for getting sick--

11:06.026 --> 11:07.247
Sarah, I'm not blaming myself.

11:07.248 --> 11:09.406
I'm just taking responsibility.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.834
And tell me, what is so threatening

11:11.835 --> 11:14.660
About admitting that there
can in fact be a direct link

11:14.661 --> 11:16.675
Between certain personality
types and cancer?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.960
Well, it's not threatening,
kitty. It's just not true.

11:19.961 --> 11:21.596
Well-- most
cancers are genetic.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.739
Sarah, the only person who had
cancer in our family was daisy.

11:24.740 --> 11:27.278
You think daisy the
dog gave herself cancer?

11:27.279 --> 11:30.121
Well, she was a nervous,
type-a kind of dog.

11:30.122 --> 11:30.961
Oh! Come on.

11:30.962 --> 11:33.860
Listen, picking out feelings in yourself

11:33.861 --> 11:35.817
That match some cancer profile,

11:35.818 --> 11:39.103
It's like looking up the
horoscope on the comic's page.

11:39.104 --> 11:42.246
- You know, it fits anybody. 
- It fits me.

11:42.247 --> 11:45.722
And if I somehow gave cancer the
opportunity to grow inside my body,

11:45.723 --> 11:48.881
Then I have a responsibility to change.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.150
And maybe if I try really hard,

11:51.151 --> 11:53.277
I can get rid of it.

11:53.278 --> 11:58.008
Uh, well...  Okay, okay, okay.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.007
I don't understand why that
means you can't continue with--

12:00.008 --> 12:00.737
Sarah.

12:00.738 --> 12:03.834
sarah.

12:05.548 --> 12:07.166
I see you went shopping.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.737
That's a pretty color.

12:09.738 --> 12:13.054
Want to help me choose a dress?

12:13.055 --> 12:15.499
I'll make you a deal--
I'll help you choose a dress

12:15.500 --> 12:20.388
If you reconsider having
another round of chemo.

12:20.389 --> 12:21.960
Sarah, help if you want to help,

12:21.961 --> 12:26.595
But... I'm not making any deals.

12:27.023 --> 12:29.197
I thought there were more
contributions this year.

12:29.198 --> 12:31.721
Yes, but donations are down 20%.

12:31.722 --> 12:34.784
Are you gonna have to send
any of the families home?

12:34.785 --> 12:36.022
I hope not.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.387
Obviously the benefit tonight

12:37.388 --> 12:40.927
Won't cover all the shortfall, but...

12:40.928 --> 12:44.848
Nora, did you get the final
head count for tonight?

12:45.928 --> 12:46.793
Nora?

12:46.794 --> 12:49.419
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.053
You know, I'm gonna
need to get some air.

12:52.054 --> 12:56.995
I'll be back. I'm just...
Gonna get a little air.

13:01.451 --> 13:03.860
You ran outta there
pretty fast just now.

13:03.861 --> 13:05.608
Anything I can do?

13:05.609 --> 13:08.116
Have you got a cigarette? I
haven't smoked in 30 years,

13:08.117 --> 13:09.450
But I'd kill for one right now.

13:09.451 --> 13:13.751
I can't help you with that,
I'm afraid. Simon craig.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.052
- Hi, I'm nora walker.
- Oh, I know.

13:15.053 --> 13:19.163
You founded the center. I
just started volunteering here.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.386
Well, I wish I'd never
thought of the place.

13:21.387 --> 13:22.338
You don't mean that.

13:22.339 --> 13:25.211
Oh, yes, I do. I hate cancer.

13:25.212 --> 13:27.734
I hate everything about cancer.

13:27.735 --> 13:30.957
I hate it. It's so
depressing. You have no idea.

13:30.958 --> 13:34.115
I kinda do. I'm an oncologist.

13:34.116 --> 13:35.211
I do research now,

13:35.212 --> 13:38.782
But I like keeping in touch
with the reason I'm doing it.

13:38.783 --> 13:40.797
How do you stand it? I'm serious.

13:40.798 --> 13:42.593
How do you stand it?

13:42.594 --> 13:45.860
I compartmentalize. Self-defense.

13:45.861 --> 13:47.860
Well, I hope you think
about something else

13:47.861 --> 13:49.813
- When you go home at night. 
- I try.

13:49.814 --> 13:52.655
Lucky you.

13:53.401 --> 13:55.654
My daughter has lymphoma.

13:55.655 --> 13:57.051
I'm sorry.

13:57.052 --> 13:59.495
Yeah. I come here and talk about cancer.

13:59.496 --> 14:01.861
I go home and I talk about cancer.

14:01.862 --> 14:06.060
Why didn't I try to
save the whales instead?

14:07.561 --> 14:09.035
I think you need to get away.

14:09.036 --> 14:10.638
Oh, I don't have time for a vacation.

14:10.639 --> 14:14.114
No, no, no, I mean for
an hour, clear your head.

14:14.115 --> 14:15.940
You want to go for a ride?

14:15.941 --> 14:20.622
Why would I want to go for a ride?

14:20.623 --> 14:22.526
On that? Yeah.

14:22.527 --> 14:23.891
- Oh, no. 
- Come on.

14:23.892 --> 14:26.637
- I-I don't do that. I'm not
getting on that. - Come on.

14:26.638 --> 14:29.367
I don't have a helmet. What a shame.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.717
I always carry a spare.

14:31.797 --> 14:34.543
Any more excuses?

14:34.749 --> 14:38.337
All right.

14:49.003 --> 14:53.241
All right. Here I come. Right there.

14:58.704 --> 15:00.176
Cancer's a weird disease.

15:00.177 --> 15:02.203
Sometimes
the--the cure

15:02.204 --> 15:06.208
- Seems like it'll kill you before the cancer.
- Yeah.

15:06.209 --> 15:10.207
But everyone threatens to
quit chemo at some point.

15:10.208 --> 15:13.335
And almost everyone goes back.

15:14.208 --> 15:17.731
I just want kitty to be
realistic about all of this.

15:17.732 --> 15:19.128
Well, what's realistic?

15:19.129 --> 15:20.810
I once had a patient go into remission

15:20.811 --> 15:24.270
After a shaman told her to
picture herself as a panther.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.032
Oh, good god.

15:26.033 --> 15:28.143
Look, I'm not advocating
your daughter quit chemo.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.404
But, uh, I don't think
there's anything wrong

15:30.405 --> 15:32.836
with a little voodoo on the side.

15:32.837 --> 15:36.270
No, I like voodoo.

15:36.271 --> 15:37.587
I think she just wants to believe

15:37.588 --> 15:40.730
She has the power to change things.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.873
Yeah, the power to change--
oh, that would be so kitty.

15:43.874 --> 15:46.238
The power to change things--
she's in politics. Mm.

15:46.239 --> 15:48.904
Now if this were happening
to sarah, my oldest daughter,

15:48.905 --> 15:49.984
She would be the general

15:49.985 --> 15:51.952
And she would line up all of her options

15:51.953 --> 15:53.337
And order them to charge.

15:53.338 --> 15:56.111
Or kevin, my middle son,
would argue them to death

15:56.112 --> 15:58.666
Or sue them or so-- I
told you, he's the lawyer.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.836
- Yeah, you told me a lot about your children. 
- Yeah.

16:01.837 --> 16:05.920
I'm sorry. I'm--d--
do you have children?

16:05.921 --> 16:08.602
No kids. No wife.

16:08.603 --> 16:09.745
Just a motorcycle.

16:09.746 --> 16:13.332
Just a motorcycle.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.824
Okay. We'll go back.

16:14.825 --> 16:17.404
- Yeah. Thank you. This
was--  - I'm glad you came.

16:17.405 --> 16:20.004
Yeah, me, too.

16:20.492 --> 16:23.031
I'm fine. It was just flu leftovers.

16:23.032 --> 16:24.618
I just needed to get up and get going.

16:24.619 --> 16:27.014
Okay, but what if
it's not flu leftovers?

16:27.015 --> 16:29.284
I mean, rebecca, have you
ever had your thyroid checked?

16:29.285 --> 16:30.189
Because
hypothyroid can--

16:30.190 --> 16:31.270
is that the one where you gain weight?

16:31.271 --> 16:32.935
- Are you saying that I gained weight? 
- No. No, no.

16:32.936 --> 16:34.141
I'm not saying you gained weight.

16:34.142 --> 16:36.141
What I'm trying to do is
check every possibility.

16:36.142 --> 16:37.062
Like when you say you're tired

16:37.063 --> 16:39.395
After you slept okay,
that could be epstein-barr.

16:39.396 --> 16:42.204
Or your undefined muscle pain,
that could be fibromyalgia.

16:42.205 --> 16:42.982
Rebecca, that's
what they say to--

16:42.983 --> 16:45.920
justin, I don't have cancer.

16:46.428 --> 16:47.808
Becca, look, I didn't--
I didn't say cancer.

16:47.809 --> 16:51.188
I know, but you were
going to eventually. I...

16:51.189 --> 16:52.712
I know that you're worried about kitty

16:52.713 --> 16:54.061
And I know that you're
going to med school.

16:54.062 --> 16:56.521
But I just had the flu. I had the flu,

16:56.522 --> 16:57.775
And it knocked the wind out of me,

16:57.776 --> 17:01.315
And now I'm fine, okay?

17:01.316 --> 17:04.886
Okay. All right, I'm sorry.
I'm just worried about you.

17:04.887 --> 17:08.156
Well, stop worrying.

17:09.459 --> 17:10.823
No more headache?

17:10.824 --> 17:12.299
No more headache.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.569
I can't believe he used
the term "reverse racism."

17:14.569 --> 17:15.759
Yeah, dug his own grave.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.632
Yeah, I would've liked
to have helped him.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.076
Hey, sarah. What's up?

17:20.077 --> 17:21.410
Hey, uh, listen.

17:21.411 --> 17:24.679
I'm--I'm at mom's with kitty.
You--you gotta talk to her.

17:24.680 --> 17:25.551
Why, what's wrong?

17:25.553 --> 17:27.679
- Is--is everything
okay?  - Yes, she is now.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.996
She's getting dolled up
for this benefit tonight.

17:30.997 --> 17:32.615
You just-- you've
gotta talk to her.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.473
I think she's losing perspective.

17:34.474 --> 17:36.298
I-I don't understand.
What about--

17:36.299 --> 17:39.680
Robert, can I have a word with you?

17:40.728 --> 17:41.869
Okay, I have to go.

17:41.870 --> 17:45.370
Um, tell her I'll be home
at 6:00 to pick her up.

17:45.371 --> 17:48.044
Just take it easy.

17:48.045 --> 17:49.948
You seemed a little flat in there.

17:49.949 --> 17:52.345
E-everything all right?

17:52.346 --> 17:53.647
Everything's great.

17:53.648 --> 17:56.535
I just want to make sure
that you bring your a-game.

17:56.536 --> 17:58.916
Otherwise, it wouldn't be much fun.

17:58.917 --> 17:59.853
Well, it's a long race.

17:59.854 --> 18:02.662
I'm sure you'll find out
a way to have some fun.

18:02.663 --> 18:04.789
Are you sure you entered
the right race, robert?

18:04.790 --> 18:05.916
Because you might be more comfortable

18:05.917 --> 18:08.630
In the democrat primary. Don't.

18:08.631 --> 18:13.329
You know, I said I'd be
nice in there, not out here.

18:13.330 --> 18:16.455
You know what's wrong
with you, henderson?

18:16.456 --> 18:19.344
You're scared because all of
the advantages that you had,

18:19.345 --> 18:20.137
They're all falling by the wayside,

18:20.138 --> 18:22.407
And the game's not fixed anymore.

18:22.408 --> 18:23.661
I don't need any advantages.

18:23.662 --> 18:25.820
I'm an extremely successful businessman.

18:25.821 --> 18:27.550
It's your grandfather's company, barry.

18:27.551 --> 18:29.296
He's the one who built
it from the ground up.

18:29.297 --> 18:32.613
You don't know the first
thing about my grandfather.

18:32.614 --> 18:34.804
I'm trying to preserve
what he stood for.

18:34.805 --> 18:37.423
What he stood for... Was hard work

18:37.424 --> 18:39.851
And the ability to make
something of your life.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.550
There are people like your grandfather

18:41.551 --> 18:43.058
Coming to this country every day

18:43.059 --> 18:44.994
Dying to pick up the
ball and run with it.

18:44.995 --> 18:46.724
And all you're doing is alienating

18:46.725 --> 18:47.740
Every single one of 'em.

18:47.741 --> 18:49.946
What I am doing is trying to preserve

18:49.947 --> 18:51.423
The american way of life.

18:51.424 --> 18:53.280
I love the way you throw that around.

18:53.281 --> 18:54.518
"preserve our way of life,"

18:54.519 --> 18:57.407
A phrase made infamous
by the k.k.k. By the way.

18:57.408 --> 18:58.914
Why don't you try preserving the one

18:58.915 --> 19:01.327
That starts with "all
men are created equal"?

19:01.328 --> 19:03.327
My god, children have
to listen to you--

19:03.328 --> 19:04.882
My
children--

19:04.883 --> 19:08.947
Listen to your race-baiting,
xenophobic garbage.

19:09.487 --> 19:11.406
Keep it up, pal.

19:11.407 --> 19:14.437
You'll get my a-game.

19:16.327 --> 19:19.504
Still seem flat to you?

19:34.787 --> 19:37.040
Well, what--
what do you think?

19:37.041 --> 19:38.738
What do you--what do you
think of the bubble skirt?

19:38.739 --> 19:42.469
Well... It looks a little
like you're about to run off

19:42.470 --> 19:44.469
And join the circus.

19:44.470 --> 19:47.103
Oh.  You're right. You're right.

19:47.104 --> 19:49.786
I-I look like--
like a giant tomato.

19:49.787 --> 19:51.262
Oh, my god. Actually, you do.

19:51.263 --> 19:53.897
You look like a big, fat ojai tomato.

19:53.898 --> 19:55.960
But you know what? I-I like tomatoes.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.024
Fruit and vegetables are
my life. You look great.

19:58.025 --> 19:59.119
Well, I thought about this one.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.706
I think this one is really beautiful,

20:00.707 --> 20:03.515
- But I think it makes me look
flat-chested. - Oh, my god.

20:03.516 --> 20:04.563
Do you remember that time

20:04.564 --> 20:06.833
You ripped out the shoulder
pads from one of my jackets...

20:06.834 --> 20:07.703
Oh, sarah, sarah...

20:07.704 --> 20:09.084
- That was not my fault! 
- And stuffed them into

20:09.085 --> 20:09.912
the formal winter dance dress?

20:09.913 --> 20:10.896
Mom would not let me
buy a padded bra. No.

20:10.897 --> 20:12.175
No, remember your date?

20:12.176 --> 20:14.039
He hugged you, and they popped out?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.864
- Oh, no, no, stop, stop.
- You were so embarrassed.

20:15.865 --> 20:16.836
Okay, okay, stop.

20:16.837 --> 20:17.943
I'm not gonna think
about that. That I--

20:17.944 --> 20:20.070
That is too much negative energy.

20:20.071 --> 20:23.721
I'm just--i-I don't remember
going to those dances.

20:23.722 --> 20:28.372
All I remember is
getting ready with you.

20:28.373 --> 20:32.086
Well, that was the only fun part.

20:32.087 --> 20:33.673
And, sarah...

20:33.674 --> 20:37.437
Thank you so much for
doing this with me.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.197
Let's hope that, um...

20:42.198 --> 20:44.609
This is the only thing
you remember when,

20:44.610 --> 20:47.870
You know, when you
get through everything.

20:47.871 --> 20:51.308
Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to do facials?

20:51.309 --> 20:53.942
Have I ever said no to
putting goop on my face?

20:53.943 --> 20:56.196
- Come on.  
- I have the best stuff.

20:56.197 --> 20:58.234
I bought this incredible new
stuff. It's this new mud clay.

20:58.234 --> 21:00.105
It's downstairs on the kitchen counter.

21:00.105 --> 21:01.539
-Want me to get
it ? -Yeah. -okay.

21:04.599 --> 21:07.099
What you guys doing?

21:07.132 --> 21:09.466
We're just having fun.

21:09.499 --> 21:11.900
Uh, we're-- we're
gonna do facials, mom,

21:11.933 --> 21:13.900
With, uh, mud goop.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.933
Well, i love facials.

21:15.966 --> 21:18.866
Okay. well, help yourself to some mud.

21:24.165 --> 21:27.466
Sarah, what happened up there?

21:27.499 --> 21:29.112
Well, i had a long
talk with her, and i--

21:29.113 --> 21:30.766
is she gonna do her
second round of chemo?

21:30.799 --> 21:32.266
I don't know.

21:32.299 --> 21:34.432
Right now, she just wants to look pretty

21:34.466 --> 21:36.432
And have a positive attitude.

21:36.466 --> 21:39.533
Well, you know, maybe there's
nothing wrong with that.

21:39.536 --> 21:42.065
Maybe she just needs to feel
in charge of her own recovery.

21:42.099 --> 21:44.065
No, mom. stay strong. look at me.

21:44.099 --> 21:46.599
I--i'm mixing red
clay from the andes

21:46.633 --> 21:48.399
With mediterranean seaweed.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.599
Don't you drink the kool-aid, too.

21:50.633 --> 21:54.605
Sarah, maybe we just need
to let her go through this.

21:54.605 --> 21:58.099
It's delusional.She even thinks
her hair's not gonna fall out

21:58.165 --> 22:00.132
From the chemo she's already had.

22:00.165 --> 22:01.199
Well, she'll come
around about all of this.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.628
Maybe we should just
give her "happy moment."

22:03.629 --> 22:05.199
She's setting herself up for a fall

22:05.232 --> 22:07.765
I mean, so it's like watching
someone just run off a cliff.

22:07.832 --> 22:10.799
Oh, yes, by all means. just
let her have her happy moment,

22:10.832 --> 22:12.604
And then she'll stupidly
jump off the cliff.

22:12.605 --> 22:14.266
Sweetie, that is not what we meant.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.991
You know what? if you guys
want to keep on laughing at me,

22:15.999 --> 22:17.364
If you want to make
fun of me, that's fine.

22:17.365 --> 22:19.475
-i'm not making fun-- No
one's laughing. come on.

22:19.475 --> 22:21.000
God, look at me. i'm--
you know what? i'm shaking.

22:21.109 --> 22:22.491
This is what i'm talking about.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.129
I do not want this anger in my life.

22:24.130 --> 22:27.358
So please just do me a
favor and leave me alone.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.499
"those animals are busy, logan, thought.

22:36.533 --> 22:38.499
"i wonder why. i better ask grandma.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.499
"and he gave her another try.

22:40.533 --> 22:43.533
"this time logan's finger went tip tap,

22:43.537 --> 22:45.637
"tip tip tap."

22:45.666 --> 22:48.433
"'hello? is grandma there?'

22:48.466 --> 22:50.300
"no, it's a crocodile.

22:50.334 --> 22:52.300
"snap,
s--"

22:52.334 --> 22:54.600
Well, that's not a crocodile.

22:54.633 --> 22:57.000
Hey, you guys.

22:57.033 --> 23:01.133
What cha doing, evan?
are you reading a book?

23:03.366 --> 23:05.566
Do you want to go to this tonight?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.900
Of course i do.

23:07.933 --> 23:11.499
Good. i'm just gonna make
sure that you're okay.

23:11.533 --> 23:13.399
Uh-huh. okay.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.800
So which one of them called you?

23:15.833 --> 23:18.867
You know i know better
than to burn a source.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.234
Look, i'm...

23:22.267 --> 23:26.067
I'm just trying to take care of myself.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.867
I-i know. i know. they
think i'm deranged, but--

23:28.900 --> 23:30.867
I think they're just anxious.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.867
I know, but that's the point.

23:32.900 --> 23:36.200
That's exactly what
i'm trying not to be.

23:36.234 --> 23:38.200
Well, there won't be any drama tonight,

23:38.234 --> 23:42.200
'cause i got your back.

23:42.234 --> 23:44.167
Okay.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.167
It's really great. you know, i feel like

23:47.200 --> 23:49.499
I'm getting to know
my dad all over again.

23:49.533 --> 23:52.200
Without my mom, he's allowed
to have an actual personality.

23:52.234 --> 23:54.399
Well, that is great.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.700
Oh, he's over there. oh, where?

23:56.733 --> 23:59.234
With that attractive lady.

23:59.267 --> 24:01.100
What's that supposed to mean?

24:01.133 --> 24:03.700
He's friendly. he'll talk
to anyone, even strangers.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.399
I don't think they're strangers.

24:06.433 --> 24:09.300
Oh, my god. he's sleeping with her.

24:09.334 --> 24:11.800
You're cut off. wh--i
haven't started drinking yet.

24:11.833 --> 24:15.470
Kevin-- well, come on. look at the way
she's tilting her head as he talks to her.

24:15.470 --> 24:16.431
Look at the way he's staring at her.

24:16.432 --> 24:17.817
You're nuts,

24:24.249 --> 24:25.624
My father was a philanderer,
and when i look back,

24:25.624 --> 24:27.743
The only things i realize
are the clues i missed.

24:27.744 --> 24:29.392
Well, we're talking about
my father, not yours.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.268
He doesn't have it in him. trust me.

24:31.268 --> 24:32.425
i'm not so sure about that.

24:33.258 --> 24:34.258
Are you guys early?

24:34.258 --> 24:36.558
Yeah, there was no
traffic, so... here we are.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.291
Ready for dinner?

24:39.325 --> 24:42.126
Yeah. i made a reservation
at a great steak place.

24:42.159 --> 24:44.059
I know the chef. it's gonna be my treat.

24:44.092 --> 24:46.059
Oh, my god. what?

24:46.092 --> 24:49.425
Oh, my god. i'm so
sorry. i have to leave.

24:49.425 --> 24:52.259
I'm so sorry. um, robert's
meltdown was caught on camera,

24:52.259 --> 24:54.391
And now it's on youtube.
i'm--i'm really sorry.

24:54.391 --> 24:55.358
No, no, fine, go. wally,
forgive me. i'll see you later?

24:55.391 --> 24:57.558
Uh, yeah. great. i'm so sorry. Bye.

24:58.392 --> 24:59.658
Does he always rush off like that?

24:59.692 --> 25:02.159
Yeah. let's get a drink.

25:06.492 --> 25:09.358
This-- this is
really fancy.

25:09.358 --> 25:11.491
Yeah, you know, she did
a good job with all this.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.167
Oh, god. do you know,
you look fantastic?

25:14.167 --> 25:17.000
You know, i never realized how
tense i was about these things

25:17.033 --> 25:20.400
Until i tried to stop being
so tense about these things.

25:20.434 --> 25:22.267
Yeah. well, you know,
we'll just have a good time.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.734
Oh, kitty. it's the perfect dress.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.734
It's perfect. what'd i tell you?

25:26.767 --> 25:29.567
I'm gonna go get a fizzy water.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.534
You know, i just think she's
feeling a little vulnerable.

25:37.167 --> 25:38.200
Yeah, i understand.

25:41.133 --> 25:43.900
I knew i saw a cute biker
chick across the room.

25:43.900 --> 25:45.734
Simon, hi. how are you?

25:46.967 --> 25:48.100
You all right? i'm fine.

25:48.133 --> 25:51.301
Um, i have a speech to give,
so i'm a little nervous.

25:51.303 --> 25:53.167
I bet you'll be great.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.667
Oh, shrimp.Oh, no. those smell weird.

25:55.667 --> 25:57.267
They smell fine to me. thanks.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.233
There's your mom.

26:03.567 --> 26:05.534
Who's she talking to? i don't know.

26:05.767 --> 26:09.400
You know that guy? no,
but do you think maybe--

26:09.434 --> 26:10.800
Do i think? no, i don't think anything.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.066
I mean, that's my mom.

26:15.634 --> 26:17.033
So thank you.

26:17.066 --> 26:18.400
Right there.

26:18.434 --> 26:20.434
Uh, right behind you,
turn around and look.

26:20.467 --> 26:23.300
That's my son Justin and his fiancee

26:23.333 --> 26:25.467
Ooh, hi.
he's--he's the one--

26:25.500 --> 26:27.667
In medical school. yeah, i know.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.458
So, nora, when are we
gonna have our second date?

26:29.459 --> 26:31.300
Second? was that a date?

26:31.333 --> 26:34.300
What, you ride around on a
bike with every guy who asks?

26:34.333 --> 26:36.801
Well, not a lot of guys
ask me. well, they should.

26:36.834 --> 26:39.933
I did. i'm asking you
again. what do you say?

26:39.966 --> 26:43.100
Well, i... say

26:43.133 --> 26:44.400
Thank you very
much, but i--

26:44.434 --> 26:46.667
All right, wait. do--
just hold--don't say no.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.167
I'm gonna be right back

26:48.200 --> 26:50.167
After you finish that glass of wine.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.767
Right back.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.834
Hey, nora. hi, mom.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.567
Hi. who's the guy? he's cute.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.134
Well, he's--he's a doctor who
volunteers here at the center.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.000
I met him yesterday.

27:06.033 --> 27:08.533
He's very nice. simon. oh, simon.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.533
What--stop
it.

27:11.566 --> 27:14.634
He--we took one little
motorcycle ride to get some air.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.411
That's all. i'm--i'm sorry. did you
just say you went on a motorcycle ride.

27:18.567 --> 27:20.167
I'm--i'm sorry. rebecca,
have you met my mother,

27:20.200 --> 27:23.100
Who wouldn't let me within
100 yards of a motorcycle?

27:23.133 --> 27:25.370
And now you're on some hog with a simon?

27:25.371 --> 27:26.834
i wasn't on a hog. i
was on a motorcycle.

27:26.837 --> 27:27.788
What are you talking about?

27:27.789 --> 27:29.000
It's the same thing.
did you wear leather.

27:29.033 --> 27:31.257
I did not wear leather.
i had a little--

27:31.258 --> 27:32.066
What were you doing on the

27:32.100 --> 27:34.400
Do--do you mind if have a
word with mom? sure. yeah.

27:34.434 --> 27:36.867
Yeah. go right ahead. just
ask her about biker boy.

27:36.901 --> 27:38.233
Oh. biker boy?

27:38.267 --> 27:40.334
It's nothing. listen.

27:40.767 --> 27:43.367
What? kitty just gave
me the cold shoulder.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.233
Oh, yes, me, too.

27:45.267 --> 27:48.233
We just have to let her do
whatever it is she needs to do.

27:48.267 --> 27:51.400
This is about her feelings, not ours.

27:51.434 --> 27:54.901
I was thinking of wearing my
kluve the crusader outfit tomorrow,

27:54.933 --> 27:57.300
But it's really just a
ratty, old halloween costume

27:57.333 --> 27:58.700
Compared to what the kids
are wearing these days.

27:58.700 --> 28:00.233
It's a convention. it doesn't
matter what you look like.

28:00.233 --> 28:04.400
We should go. i'm hungry. yeah.

28:04.434 --> 28:07.867
Oh, damn.I forgot my wallet in the room.

28:07.901 --> 28:10.033
Oh, here. i'll come with you.
no, that all right. wait here.

28:10.066 --> 28:13.033
I'll be right back.i want
to see your comic books.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.500
No, scotty. we're
gonna do that tomorrow.

28:16.234 --> 28:17.667
Dad, what's going on?

28:19.367 --> 28:22.600
Oh. oh, did-- did
you meet someone here?

28:22.604 --> 28:24.000
'cause, i mean, th-that's okay.

28:24.033 --> 28:26.834
Is that the woman you were with?

28:26.867 --> 28:29.667
Her name's moira, and
i didn't meet her here.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.333
I've been seeing her for a while.

28:34.367 --> 28:36.200
I've been trying to find
the right time to tell you.

28:36.233 --> 28:37.954
I can't believe this. it's one
of the reasons why we came here.

28:37.954 --> 28:39.123
Because she wanted to meet you.

28:39.123 --> 28:40.966
That's why mom left,isn't she?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.489
I shoulda told you this sooner.

28:42.490 --> 28:44.975
You lied to me. you make me
blame mom and all this time,

28:44.975 --> 28:46.551
You've been screwing
around with another woman?

28:46.551 --> 28:47.491
I'm sorry, scotty,

28:47.491 --> 28:48.883
But it's not like i
had-- but--but what?

28:48.900 --> 28:50.631
Can we just talk about this,please?

28:50.632 --> 28:52.067
I have nothing to say to you.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.766
Enjoy the rest of your trip.

29:01.900 --> 29:05.700
Hey. uh, can i get a water, please?

29:07.633 --> 29:09.232
So i hope you put a helmet on my mother

29:09.266 --> 29:12.067
When you took her on
that hog of yours, doc.

29:12.099 --> 29:14.623
You must be justin, the
one in medical school.

29:14.624 --> 29:16.200
Don't get cocky. she tells everyone.

29:16.203 --> 29:18.167
I bet. so how are your classes?

29:18.168 --> 29:19.800
Great if you're for memorizing

29:19.833 --> 29:21.927
A thousand different diseases
that start with a stomachache.

29:21.933 --> 29:23.433
Clinical diagnostics, huh?

29:23.434 --> 29:24.933
like, how do you figure
out what's wrong with people

29:24.966 --> 29:26.753
If there's literally
hundreds of possibilities?

29:26.754 --> 29:27.933
You know, when i was intern

29:27.966 --> 29:31.491
A woman came in with a rash all
over her body--total mystery.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.700
Did a biopsy, gave her cortisone,

29:33.733 --> 29:37.299
I thought she had some exotic
melanoma. well, did she?

29:37.299 --> 29:39.866
No. turns out she was allergic
to her laundry detergent.

29:39.900 --> 29:42.067
It was the simplest explanation

29:42.100 --> 29:44.033
When you hear hoofbeats...

29:44.067 --> 29:46.833
You think horses, not zebras.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.000
Will you excuse me for a second?

29:54.100 --> 29:56.000
Hello.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.466
Hello.

29:59.499 --> 30:00.966
Hello.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.966
Thank you so much for coming.

30:03.966 --> 30:09.266
And--and welcome, uh, to the
second-annual fund-raiser for open doors.

30:09.299 --> 30:11.833
The idea for open
doors was simple--

30:11.836 --> 30:14.233
To help families with children

30:14.233 --> 30:17.199
Visiting los angeles
for cancer treatments.

30:17.199 --> 30:19.866
And while we can't
diminish the seriousness

30:19.869 --> 30:21.599
Of what their children
are going through,

30:21.633 --> 30:24.299
We can ease their financial burden a bit

30:24.332 --> 30:27.800
And give them a friendly,
safe place to stay.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.700
I hope you will all have the opportunity

30:29.700 --> 30:32.066
To look at the literature
that's scattered about

30:32.069 --> 30:34.632
And then you can learn more about us.

30:34.632 --> 30:38.633
Um, there have been so
many exciting new treatments

30:38.636 --> 30:40.833
Discovered over the past few years,

30:40.866 --> 30:44.900
But we can't forget this--
there's no substitute for hope.

30:44.933 --> 30:47.533
And when families stick together,

30:47.566 --> 30:49.633
Hope stays strong.

30:51.567 --> 30:55.799
Fighting cancer requires
medicine and faith.

30:55.799 --> 30:59.833
Faith--believeing in
something deeply and certainly,

30:59.866 --> 31:01.433
Without a single doubt.

31:01.466 --> 31:03.833
The fear of losing control

31:03.866 --> 31:06.033
Is as dangerous as the disease itself.

31:06.067 --> 31:09.100
Fear keeps us doubting
instead of hoping,

31:09.133 --> 31:11.100
Looking down instead of up,

31:11.133 --> 31:14.100
And this evening is
all about looking up,

31:14.133 --> 31:16.866
So look down only
long enough to fill out

31:16.900 --> 31:18.466
Your contribution form.

31:18.499 --> 31:22.700
Um, and have a-a wonderful
evening,Um, tonight.

31:22.733 --> 31:25.033
Have a good time. thank you so much.

31:54.599 --> 31:56.699
Kitty?

32:01.266 --> 32:03.233
Kitty, are you in here?

32:03.266 --> 32:05.933
Uh, yeah. yeah, i'm here, mom.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.966
I'll be--i'll be out in
a minute. are you okay?

32:09.000 --> 32:13.066
Yeah, i'm fine.
just--just let me be, okay?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.066
Oh, honey, please come out.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.799
Mom, please. i...

32:16.833 --> 32:19.400
Don't want anybody to see me.

32:20.133 --> 32:22.300
Why?

32:30.466 --> 32:31.367
Look at me.

32:33.532 --> 32:36.399
Oh, honey. look at my hair.

32:36.399 --> 32:37.166
Oh, honey.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.800
No, mom. why can't i understand this?

32:40.803 --> 32:43.233
Why--why did this
have to happen to me?

32:43.266 --> 32:45.599
Oh, honey.

32:45.632 --> 32:48.933
I don't know.

32:48.966 --> 32:51.899
I don't know, honey.

32:59.467 --> 33:01.733
Rebecca, hey. oh, hey. sorry.

33:01.766 --> 33:03.899
Excuse me. what's up?

33:04.233 --> 33:06.066
Are you pregnant?

33:07.100 --> 33:08.366
Are you serious?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.350
Wh-why would you ask
me that? That's crazy.

33:10.366 --> 33:12.233
That's the first questions I should ask

33:12.233 --> 33:13.933
A woman in her 20s with those symptoms.

33:13.966 --> 33:15.699
I mean, you're tired,
you're--you're queasy,

33:15.699 --> 33:18.466
You--you--you didn't eat
the shrimp. you love shrimp.

33:18.466 --> 33:21.567
No, look, it's fine. see? delicious.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.467
Thanks. no big deal.

33:25.499 --> 33:29.367
What? it's fine. i'm
not pregnant, justin.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.733
Okay.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.866
...by the way.Why don't you
try preserving the one...

33:36.899 --> 33:38.166
This is where you call
him a race-baiting,

33:38.169 --> 33:40.866
Xenophobic purveyor of garbage. he is.

33:40.899 --> 33:43.766
Yeah, well, not to the
millions of right-wing americans

33:43.799 --> 33:45.866
Who are now gunning for you.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.666
Robert, it's gonna be like a fatwa.

33:47.669 --> 33:50.899
Checks will fly. you just
bankrolled his entire campaign.

33:50.933 --> 33:53.299
You now have henderson
and kern both breathing

33:53.303 --> 33:56.243
So we need to strategize. you
don't expect me to disowe us.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.400
No, not at all.

33:58.433 --> 33:59.899
Just step back, clarify,

33:59.933 --> 34:02.899
And do not lose a primary
over something like this.

34:02.933 --> 34:04.199
The point is the general election.

34:04.203 --> 34:06.299
So let's look to the
future. that's the point.

34:06.933 --> 34:11.166
It's not about the
future-- not now, not here.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.299
Nobody knows if they're even
gonna be around tomorrow.

34:14.632 --> 34:16.632
What if my son never knew

34:16.666 --> 34:18.632
How i felt about guys like henderson?

34:18.666 --> 34:20.632
Okay, now you're just making me feel

34:20.666 --> 34:22.132
Like a cheap,
tawdry--

34:22.166 --> 34:23.666
No, that's your job.

34:23.668 --> 34:26.666
You just gotta pick your battles.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.966
Which just happens to be mine.

34:33.498 --> 34:35.000
Who's mary wadsworth?

34:35.003 --> 34:37.500
She's a cancer-free,
type-a person just like me

34:37.500 --> 34:40.331
Who quit chemo and didn't lose her hair.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.132
Well, screw mary wadsworth.

34:42.166 --> 34:46.000
There are models who eat fried chicken
every day,and they still lose weight.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.321
These people are freaks of nature.

34:47.322 --> 34:49.266
Why can't i be a freaks of nature?

34:50.799 --> 34:52.498
Out of order. go away.

34:52.498 --> 34:54.199
I know. it's me. come on, let me in.

34:54.199 --> 34:57.733
Come on, kitty. what
is going on in here?

35:00.866 --> 35:02.367
My god.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.300
You see? i told you. i
told you it was noticeable.

35:06.333 --> 35:08.666
Just... just a little bit.

35:08.666 --> 35:11.259
Sarah,you nearly gasped.

35:12.166 --> 35:13.699
Oh, kitty.

35:14.633 --> 35:15.699
It was bound to happen.

35:15.733 --> 35:19.300
No, i know, i know. it's
just that i hate this.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.300
You know, at least
before when i felt sick,

35:21.333 --> 35:23.867
Nobody knew i had cancer, but
now everybody's gonna know.

35:23.870 --> 35:25.955
Kitty, everyone who loves
you, when they look at you,

35:25.955 --> 35:26.962
All they see is you.

35:26.962 --> 35:29.185
yeah,you're not alone.
you know that,right?

35:29.200 --> 35:31.666
We're here for you.
we're right here. i know.

35:31.699 --> 35:35.666
You're sitting on my hand.
oh! for--for god sake's.

35:35.699 --> 35:37.666
Well, you should say
something. no, it's okay.

35:37.699 --> 35:40.600
I'm--i'm not
complaining. i just...

35:41.834 --> 35:44.566
We should really go back.
robert's worried about you.

35:46.133 --> 35:48.576
Oh, god.What? oh, no. i can't. i can't.

35:48.577 --> 35:49.666
How am i gonna go out like this

35:49.700 --> 35:52.066
I mean, look at me. well,
honey-- no, wait a second.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.866
Just wait a second here.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.534
Look, hold on. okay.

35:55.567 --> 35:58.033
We'll just--we'll take this
little piece right here... oh.

35:58.066 --> 36:00.033
And we'll put it right
there. oh, that's good.

36:00.066 --> 36:01.641
Then we'll--we'll just
puff it up a little bit.

36:01.642 --> 36:02.766
oh, mom, don't make it too puffy.

36:02.766 --> 36:06.200
It's not too puffy. it's not
too... you look beautiful.

36:20.699 --> 36:21.966
I need to go home.

36:22.899 --> 36:24.467
I got your back.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.967
Come on. let's go for a walk.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.033
You've been lying on
this couch all morning.

36:38.633 --> 36:40.600
Do you know what's weird?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.600
I don't even care that he had an affair.

36:43.633 --> 36:47.167
I mean, he was never happy with my mom.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.867
So what's going on?

36:48.900 --> 36:51.666
All my life, i kept wishing
he would stand up to her.

36:51.700 --> 36:54.199
I mean, even when he was on my side,

36:54.200 --> 36:55.506
He would never let her know.

36:55.507 --> 36:57.100
She's a pretty tough cookie,your mom.

36:57.134 --> 36:59.100
I just...

37:01.900 --> 37:04.399
I wish he could've learned to
take care of himself sooner,

37:04.433 --> 37:06.433
You know?

37:08.167 --> 37:12.134
My father took care of
himself every chance he got.

37:12.167 --> 37:14.533
It didn't make things better.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.299
And there's no way he would've
told the truth last night.

37:17.333 --> 37:18.665
He would've lied and lied,

37:18.665 --> 37:20.018
And you wouldn't have
known the difference.

37:20.266 --> 37:24.000
At least you can make peace
with him while he's still alive.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.000
I never had that chance.

37:27.433 --> 37:29.666
Oh, god, that's him that's gotta be him.

37:33.366 --> 37:35.534
Oh, hi. thanks.

37:39.466 --> 37:40.700
It's for you.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.600
What is it?

37:52.633 --> 37:56.234
It's his "captain america"
comic book from the '40s.

37:57.766 --> 37:59.400
What does the note say?

37:59.400 --> 38:01.967
"scotty, here's something
to help you guys"...

38:05.167 --> 38:07.700
"here's something to help
you guys pay for the baby.

38:07.733 --> 38:11.799
Call me when you're
ready. i love you, dad."

38:13.333 --> 38:15.299
How much is it worth?

38:15.333 --> 38:18.900
This is worth a lot, kevin.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.667
This is worth a lot.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.767
Do--do you think
she needs our help?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.800
Mom, if she needed our help,
she would've asked for it.

39:19.833 --> 39:22.200
Just come on. sit down.
let's change the subject.

39:22.233 --> 39:23.500
Oh, all right. okay.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.500
I'm just relieved she's
gonna go back into chemo.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.667
Mom, not a new subject. oh.

39:32.666 --> 39:36.966
Biker boy. well, i made
justin fill me in.Come on.

39:36.966 --> 39:39.780
When are you guys going
on your next wild ride?

39:39.780 --> 39:41.460
Never. goodness. he's
way too young for me.

39:41.461 --> 39:43.314
Way too young for me.

39:46.413 --> 39:47.881
You're blushing. i'm not.

39:47.914 --> 39:49.380
Yeah, you are. no.

39:49.413 --> 39:50.714
Yeah. no.

39:50.747 --> 39:52.181
You want it.

39:55.148 --> 39:57.314
You gotta pull out all stops, okay?

39:57.348 --> 40:00.614
Just, you know, get
a--get a new, hot look,

40:00.618 --> 40:03.614
Go in and just slither
right up to him and say,

40:03.648 --> 40:05.314
"doctor..."

40:05.348 --> 40:07.314
"i need an examination."

40:07.348 --> 40:11.348
Sarah. stop it. you're being ridiculous.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.480
How can you keep
telling kitty to--

40:17.513 --> 40:20.247
To risk and do scary things

40:20.247 --> 40:22.847
If you're not prepared
to take risks yourself?

40:22.881 --> 40:25.348
He's way too young for me.
i'm just sensible, that's all.

40:25.413 --> 40:28.981
Well, maybe this isn't the
right time to be sensible.

40:46.747 --> 40:49.281
I look like an ojai peach.

40:49.314 --> 40:52.480
Oh, no, it's fantastic. oh, my god.

40:52.513 --> 40:55.714
Can i?

40:55.747 --> 40:57.480
Oh, it's so soft.

40:57.513 --> 40:59.847
I know. it's weird. it's weird, huh? no.

40:59.881 --> 41:02.248
No? it's-- it's
great. it's beautiful.

41:02.281 --> 41:04.647
What do you think?

41:05.680 --> 41:08.747
I think you have the most
beautifully shaped head.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.847
No. no, i don't.

41:10.881 --> 41:13.014
You do. you do. you really do.

41:13.047 --> 41:14.844
But you can keep saying that.

41:14.845 --> 41:16.547
You saying that.you
saying that everyday.

41:28.614 --> 41:29.680
So about last
night, uh--

41:29.714 --> 41:32.380
Uh, no, um, look.
b-before you say anything,

41:32.413 --> 41:34.380
I want to apologize, all right?

41:34.413 --> 41:36.781
I, um, i have intern's disease.

41:36.784 --> 41:38.581
They start teaching you
about these symptoms,

41:38.584 --> 41:40.281
And all of a sudden, i have everything,

41:40.314 --> 41:43.281
And--and you have everything,
and now i'm a hypochondriac.

41:43.314 --> 41:46.547
Besides, i could not imagine
having a baby right now.

41:46.580 --> 41:51.214
With work and school
and planning a wedding

41:51.248 --> 41:54.281
And kitty being sick-- no
wonder why your head hurts.

41:54.314 --> 41:57.614
I'm sorry, okay?

41:57.647 --> 42:00.447
I love you. i gotta run to the library.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.081
Okay. love you.
