00:12.012 --> 00:15.098
[foreboding music playing]

00:16.474 --> 00:18.560
[woman] Marlon's interview, take one.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.605
[commentator]
This is a huge shot by Hansie Cronje.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.857
[crowd cheering]

00:23.940 --> 00:27.986
[Marlon Aronstam] In South Africa
at that time, Hansie was a hero.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.530
[commentator] Cronje has hit that miles.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.699
Another big one.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.912
If you've got a bat swing with the power
and timing of Cronje, that's the result.

00:37.996 --> 00:41.166
Hansie's talent was extraordinary.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.420
[commentator]
Hansie Cronje is beside himself with joy.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.591
[Marlon] One of the greatest ever captains
in South African cricket history.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.386
I should never have been able
to get close to him.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.559
[atmospheric music playing]

01:01.102 --> 01:05.231
[woman] The Delhi police has registered
a case of criminal conspiracy,

01:05.315 --> 01:10.070
fraud, and cheating against South African
cricket captain, Hansie Cronje.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.322
[Jonathan Agnew] Cronje?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.658
It seemed completely impossible.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.913
[Paddy Upton] Hansie was a hell
of a lot more than just the captain.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.709
Next to Mandela, Hansie was probably
the next highest regarded citizen.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.004
[Marlon] Hansie had everything.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.091
So, what happened next was

01:32.592 --> 01:33.426
sad.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.805
[suspenseful music playing]

01:36.888 --> 01:39.599
[Frams Cronje] If the tapes
made in New Delhi are correct,

01:39.682 --> 01:42.685
it's the most devastating thing in cricket
in the last 100 years.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.814
We knew how important winning was to him.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.651
So he would never have thrown a match.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.988
I have not received any money and I have
never ever spoken to any of the players.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.118
I just thought it was a big joke,
to be honest. Not in a million years.

01:58.743 --> 02:03.998
[Dr. Alli Bacher] Hansie Cronje is a man
of unquestionable honesty and integrity.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.376
It's libelous.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.585
It's defamatory.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.589
[Frans] There's no worse crime
to commit in sport.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.010
Could he really have done it?

02:19.764 --> 02:23.434
[theme music playing]

03:06.895 --> 03:09.230
[tense music playing]

03:10.273 --> 03:13.484
[reporter] Four hundred and fifty people
have died in riots in South Africa

03:13.568 --> 03:14.944
in the past ten months.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.033
[reporter 2] Four million whites
ruled twenty million Blacks.

03:21.951 --> 03:26.623
Apartheid is a political system designed
to ensure permanent white supremacy.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.253
For the past 19 years,
the guerrilla leader,

03:32.337 --> 03:35.757
Nelson Mandela,
has been a prisoner here on Robben Island.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.761
[woman] We want our equal rights!
That is all. Nothing else!

03:39.844 --> 03:42.222
People are being killed in South Africa.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.557
[shouting]

03:51.898 --> 03:55.109
[reporter 2] Most whites have never been
anywhere near a Black township.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.278
Safely installed
in the comfortable suburbs,

03:57.362 --> 04:01.366
they've been spared the reality
of life under the state of emergency.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.538
[Frans] Me and my brother, Hansie, grew up
at the height of apartheid in Bloemfontein

04:07.622 --> 04:09.582
in the '70s and '80s.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.503
It was conservative.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.340
Mainly white.

04:17.924 --> 04:22.387
And also, from a racial point of view,
I think most of the people in Bloemfontein

04:22.470 --> 04:24.806
accepted apartheid as the norm.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.477
But us as a family
never supported apartheid.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.773
We were in favor
of an integrated South Africa.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.158
We didn't grow up wealthy.
Both my parents were teachers.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.706
My dad was so involved in sport,
but he never put any pressure on us.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.583
We could choose what we wanted to do.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.836
And Hansie and me chose cricket.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.798
[commentator] Hansie Cronje,
he's by far South Africa's best player.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.634
[Hester Parsons] Hansie lived for cricket.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.930
When we would play, uh, backyard cricket,
he would walk out,

05:06.472 --> 05:08.391
lift his bat, thank the crowd.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.977
[commentator]
Fabulous innings in the making here.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.979
[Hester] I don't think
we had a conversation

05:13.062 --> 05:14.605
without cricket being involved.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.190
[crowd cheering]

05:16.274 --> 05:19.777
[commentator] And that's a very good shot 
indeed by Hansie Cronje. It's six.

05:19.861 --> 05:20.862
Fantastic cricket!

05:22.697 --> 05:26.200
[Allan] I met Hansie for the first time,
actually, at the cricket nets.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.494
We became big friends from day one.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.331
We just had this special bond.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.875
He was almost-- How can I say this?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.003
I don't want to do him injustice. 
He was almost like…

05:38.087 --> 05:39.589
"I'm here. Look at me."

05:39.672 --> 05:43.009
He had this aura about him
that sort of stood out.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.765
[Hester] He wanted to represent 
his country at international cricket.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.725
That was his dream.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.187
[Allan] He said it from when he was 15.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.231
He wanted to lead South Africa.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.610
He wanted to become
one of the greatest captains of all time.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.699
[Frans] Unfortunately, in the '80s,

06:06.783 --> 06:09.077
Hansie's aspirations were very limited

06:09.160 --> 06:11.496
because we were banned
from international sport.

06:16.584 --> 06:21.422
[reporter] South Africa is banned simply
because sport is based on the ethos

06:21.506 --> 06:26.094
of play and competition
being fair and equal for all.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.892
And that is not deemed possible
in this country which practices apartheid.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.979
There was no future
in playing for your country.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.650
But then…

06:41.359 --> 06:42.527
the nation changed.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.404
[helicopter whirring]

06:47.907 --> 06:49.575
[reporter 2] There's Mr. Mandela,

06:49.659 --> 06:53.579
a man who has been in prison 
for nearly three decades.

06:53.663 --> 06:57.041
Taking his first steps
into a new South Africa.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.008
[Frans] Mandela was freed, 
we could get rid of apartheid.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.011
The country had a new hope,
had a new life to it.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.764
[Nelson Mandela] I greet you all

07:12.473 --> 07:14.183
in the name of peace,

07:14.809 --> 07:17.395
democracy, and freedom for all.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.480
[crowd cheering]

07:20.022 --> 07:23.359
South Africa has been readmitted
to international cricket

07:23.443 --> 07:26.362
after more than 20 years
of sporting isolation.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.825
[Frans] Suddenly, we were back
into international sport,

07:30.908 --> 07:31.993
and a few months later,

07:32.076 --> 07:34.954
Hansie was selected
to play for South Africa.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.376
[chuckling]
It was a mixture of nerves and pride.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.672
My father couldn't watch a full cricket
match because he'd just get so nervous.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.304
[uplifting music playing]

07:54.557 --> 07:56.767
South Africa were now on the world stage.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.313
[commentator]
Welcome to the first day's play

08:00.396 --> 08:04.192
of this test match between Australia
and South Africa. It's a lovely, fine day.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.527
[Jonathan] South Africa at batting.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.197
They are desperate to prove themselves

08:09.280 --> 08:11.449
for all those lost years
when they were banned.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.703
[commentator] That's a good shot.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.914
Good innings by Hansie Cronje.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.627
[Jonathan] But South Africa's 
international experience was almost zero.

08:22.710 --> 08:23.961
[man shouting]

08:24.670 --> 08:27.798
[Jonathan] And their opponents, Australia,
the best in the world.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.137
[commentator] What a catch!

08:34.347 --> 08:36.891
Hansie Cronje gone
for a very well made 41.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.061
Got him! What a ripper!

08:40.144 --> 08:41.270
He made nine.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.273
Out to seven.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.568
-He's out!
-[Jonathan] Australia are winning.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.862
[commentator]
The Australians absolutely jubilant.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.282
And then the South African captain,
Kepler Wessels, breaks a finger.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.327
[commentator] That is desperate luck
for the South Africans.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.704
He's their top batsman
and their captain.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.500
[Jonathan] In cricket, the captain
is more important than the coach.

09:04.877 --> 09:09.173
All the strategy and the tactics
on the field are down to him.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.009
So the game

09:12.093 --> 09:13.511
is all but lost.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.807
[commentator]
South Africa in dire straits.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.812
[Allan] Our captain, Kepler,
couldn't go on the field.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.232
So he looked around the room
and thought, "Who's it gonna be?"

09:31.487 --> 09:34.448
[commentator] Cronje's acting captain
in his first service

09:34.532 --> 09:36.617
in that department for his country.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.121
[Allan] Hansie was a-- a young man.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.956
He's a rookie in that team.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.751
[commentator] South Africa all but gone.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.422
How's he gonna handle a tense situation?

09:50.172 --> 09:52.133
[commentator]
South Africa now in deep trouble.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.053
You gotta be so spot-on tactically.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.557
[Jonathan] As the fielding captain,

09:59.640 --> 10:03.352
the young Cronje is given a situation
in which the best team in the world

10:03.436 --> 10:07.273
need just 54 more runs
to win with six batsmen left.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.735
For South Africa, it's game over.

10:11.777 --> 10:16.115
Somehow, this young man had to keep
his team believing that they could win.

10:17.992 --> 10:22.121
[Allan] Hansie just said, 
"Nothing fancy. Do the basics well."

10:22.204 --> 10:25.207
"The pressure that we bring
will get us there."

10:28.544 --> 10:30.087
[announcer shouts]

10:30.171 --> 10:31.547
We had a great start.

10:32.757 --> 10:36.010
[commentator] That's a good delivery
from Donald and he's gone.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.140
He's got him.
And South Africa break through again.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.434
But then Australia started to hit a few.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.022
-[commentator] What a good shot.
-[whistle blows]

10:48.105 --> 10:50.107
[cheering]

10:50.191 --> 10:53.569
And suddenly, 
this test match is back on the tightrope.

10:54.612 --> 11:00.159
But Hansie had this immense calmness
about him that I cannot explain.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.004
[commentator] He's gone, a direct hit.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.383
What an excellent throw
from Hansie Cronje.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.551
And the South Africans strike back.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.971
What a brilliant catch.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.058
And what a great, fine bat this is.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.938
Things are starting to get real tight.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.073
[commentator] Got him! 
South Africa have got it by one.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.118
And South Africa 
have pulled off a magical victory.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.122
Oh, this is a marvelous moment
for South African cricket.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.294
Hansie captained that
like he's captained 50 test matches.

11:53.045 --> 11:57.133
Cronje somehow managed to claw a victory
from the very jaws of defeat.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.469
The tears and the goosebumps at home,

12:00.553 --> 12:03.222
seeing that and that victory,
it was unbelievable.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.102
That match changed his life.

12:08.185 --> 12:12.106
[crowd chanting] Hansie! Hansie! Hansie!

12:16.193 --> 12:17.987
[Hester] People loved Hansie.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.240
-[chuckling]
-This is paradise today.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.992
[Hester] But it didn't really change

12:23.075 --> 12:25.494
anything in our relationship 
with each other.

12:25.578 --> 12:30.374
It was always the same, always had time 
for a joke, or, you know, a good laugh.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.459
[music playing]

12:31.542 --> 12:34.086
[singing indistinctly]

12:35.004 --> 12:37.006
[others laughing]

12:44.764 --> 12:48.017
[woman]
He was one of the greatest people I knew.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.393
Gentle.

12:50.019 --> 12:50.853
Caring.

12:53.731 --> 12:54.899
[laughs]

12:54.982 --> 12:57.359
I was married to Hansie for seven years.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.404
I felt safe.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.534
I never had to worry about anything.
He, um…

13:05.618 --> 13:08.245
It was like he had
everything under control.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.836
[Mandela] The people of South Africa
have spoken in this election.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.172
They want change.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.258
And change is what they will get.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.802
[crowd cheering]

13:23.719 --> 13:26.472
[Frans] In the '94 elections,
Mandela became president.

13:27.181 --> 13:31.977
Even though people had a sense of hope
and a sense of something new happening,

13:32.061 --> 13:33.646
it was incredibly fragile.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.397
[crowd chanting indistinctly]

13:39.860 --> 13:42.780
Make a stand in your vote
with bullets and guns.

13:42.863 --> 13:46.450
Make a stand in God's name.
This is God's Land.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.077
This is the Promised Land!

13:53.791 --> 13:56.377
[Frans] Many of the more 
conservative white people

13:56.460 --> 13:59.463
got themselves armed and organized

13:59.547 --> 14:02.675
to be able to fight a civil war
if it should become necessary.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.348
[Rory Stein] President Mandela,
the majority of white South Africans,

14:09.431 --> 14:13.352
you know, myself included, in the past,
considered him to be a terrorist.

14:16.313 --> 14:20.568
Our fears were that this could
so easily go up in flames.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.529
And I mean that literally.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.326
Sport can go where politics can't.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.412
[indistinct chatter]

14:31.495 --> 14:33.581
[all chuckling]

14:33.664 --> 14:36.959
[Rory] For many white South Africans,
sport is really important.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.462
If President Mandela
identifies with sport,

14:40.546 --> 14:42.882
he will get white South Africans to say,

14:42.965 --> 14:45.467
"Let's give him a chance.
Let's see where this goes."

14:45.551 --> 14:47.219
"Where is this dream of his headed?"

14:50.431 --> 14:53.601
[Allan]
1994 was the start of a pivotal time

14:53.684 --> 14:55.185
for South African cricket.

15:00.816 --> 15:04.820
It was almost captained and coached
by one bloke, and that was Hansie Cronje.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.455
[hip-hop music plays]

15:15.706 --> 15:18.083
Hansie said, "We are gonna be

15:18.167 --> 15:20.336
the number one team
in test match cricket."

15:20.878 --> 15:23.422
"The best, one-day,
international team in the world."

15:25.215 --> 15:28.218
"And the fittest cricketing nation
on the planet."

15:30.179 --> 15:34.183
Hansie set a bar for us
as an international team.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.352
[commentator]
The South Africans were relentless.

15:36.852 --> 15:40.189
Unbelievable. I just admire
their courage so very very much.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.692
Cronje's tactics were masterly.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.403
There's the captain
who's hardly put a foot wrong.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.238
Everything that Cronje touched

15:48.989 --> 15:49.907
turned to gold.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.368
♪ The game chose me ♪

15:52.451 --> 15:54.453

[commentator] Awesome shot.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.806
Again.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.352
Oh, yeah, well,
this is just wonderful wonderful stuff.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.731
He has carried South Africa to victory

16:23.607 --> 16:26.235
with the most amazing innings.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.866
[Dr. Bacher] The country was moving
into a new direction.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.745
Hopefully, equality for all people,
Black and white.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.335
Nelson Mandela saw Hansie as a role model…

16:44.712 --> 16:46.964
to inspire other whites.

16:48.090 --> 16:54.304
[Mandela] Sport has played
an important role in uniting our country.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.475
I must congratulate in particular

16:59.768 --> 17:01.395
Captain Hansie Cronje…

17:06.692 --> 17:08.610
for the excellent manner

17:09.236 --> 17:12.072
in which he has led the national team.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.953
[Allan] Hansie Cronje became so much more
than just a cricket captain.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.336
He was anointed by Nelson Mandela
to be the man to somehow unify the nation.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.088
[crowd cheering]

17:28.172 --> 17:29.548
[Hansie] Ladies and gentlemen.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.470
It gives me great pleasure,
from the team, to thank Mr. Mandela

17:34.553 --> 17:37.056
for your immense contribution
in uniting this country

17:37.139 --> 17:38.515
and forming a new South Africa

17:38.599 --> 17:40.809
and granting us
the opportunity of playing sport.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.484
[Allan] He was on a pedestal,

17:48.567 --> 17:52.112
the like of which I don't think
I've ever come across before.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.198
[crowd cheering]

18:03.582 --> 18:05.793
[reporter] Who's your cricketing hero?

18:05.876 --> 18:08.003
Oh, it's Cronje, favorite.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.673
[reporter] Small boys the world over 
have sporting heroes,

18:11.757 --> 18:14.468
but for white men
to be heroes to Black people

18:14.551 --> 18:18.097
in the country which made
oppression a God-ordained way of life,

18:18.180 --> 18:19.932
that really is something.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.684
You guys are now heroes in the townships.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.355
What does that tell you
about how South African cricket is going?

18:26.438 --> 18:30.317
I'm sure in five or six years' time,
it won't be predominantly white.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.736
[Godlam Rajah] Hansie Cronje

18:32.820 --> 18:37.199
came from the heart
of what I call apartheid land,

18:37.282 --> 18:40.452
surrounded by people
who voted for the party

18:40.536 --> 18:43.664
that locked Nelson Mandela away
for 27 years.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.085
And yet, here I met a man
who thought like me.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.880
He said to me, "Goolam,

18:52.422 --> 18:56.385
I noticed that, again,
there's no Black players in the team."

18:56.927 --> 18:59.596
He expected players of color to be there.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.897
[Herschelle Gibbs] When I was selected,

19:08.981 --> 19:13.068
people, you know, sort of joked.
They said, "You just fill a quota."

19:13.152 --> 19:16.488
Yeah, but it's not gonna make a difference
because I was performing well.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.199
I always knew
I was gonna play for a long time.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.538
[Allan] Herschelle Gibbs
is of mixed-race from Cape Town.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.709
During apartheid, Herschelle Gibbs
would not have been on the same field

19:28.792 --> 19:30.043
as Hansie Cronje.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.258
But he was there utterly on merit.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.137
He was more than just good enough
to play cricket for South Africa.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.430
He was a star.

19:43.223 --> 19:46.894
At 22, you're basically
in awe of-- of the captain.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.688
Hansie was so well-loved

19:49.771 --> 19:52.524
and so well-respected
from his peers, that, uh…

19:53.734 --> 19:56.361
everybody would, you know,
run through a wall for him.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.405
[crowd cheering]

19:58.488 --> 20:02.075
You get captains that are different
because they read people really well

20:02.159 --> 20:03.327
on and off the field.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.998
He realized quite soon
what sort of character I was.

20:08.081 --> 20:11.585
They could see that spontaneity
and that instinctiveness that I have.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.796
Hansie brought
the best out of the players.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.469
[Paddy] He was really connected 
to the guys, easy to get on with.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.932
But in four years,
I bought Hansie a lot of beers in pubs.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.312
There might have been once when he dropped
his guard and he bought me one back.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.813
He liked money.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.399
He liked holding onto it.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.903
[commentator] Knock the pants off them!

20:38.487 --> 20:43.867
Hansie Cronje, this wonderful clean image.
He's just a sponsor's dream.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.870
[Hester] All of a sudden,
he's earning more money than my dad.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.166
Being more in the public eye,
he was more aware of how he dresses.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.127
[commentator] Slip into a pair
of Hansie Cronje casual pants.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.171
Hansie!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.173
And you did notice it.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.760
[commentator] Hansie Cronje,
easy to care for casual wear.

21:01.843 --> 21:05.097
At that stage, he had millions
and millions of rands a year

21:05.681 --> 21:08.267
from various sponsors and endorsements.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.270
Getting easy money was-- was his weakness.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.815
He wanted to do his utmost to get it.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.327
[commentator] Hello and welcome 
to the first day's play

21:27.411 --> 21:30.289
of this fifth and final test match
between South Africa and England,

21:30.372 --> 21:33.375
this time from SuperSport Park
in Centurion.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.879
[Jonathan] This is a match that I still
can't quite get my head around.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.676
And I don't think that anybody
who was there ever will, frankly.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.261
[commentator] At Centurion Park,

21:44.344 --> 21:46.346
as the England Team,
who won the toss of course,

21:46.430 --> 21:48.974
Nasser Hussain leads his team out.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.101
[Jonathan]
On the first day, South Africa batted.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.021
And then, for the next three days,

21:54.646 --> 21:55.480
it rained.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.482
[thunder rumbling]

21:57.566 --> 22:01.278
[commentator] And it really has been
very frustrating for everybody:

22:01.361 --> 22:03.238
Players, umpires,

22:03.322 --> 22:07.367
ground staff, commentators,
journalists, spectators.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.170
[Jonathan]
So we arrived for the fifth day,

22:18.920 --> 22:20.922
with only one team having batted.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.634
And that team hasn't even finished
batting for the first time yet.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.471
A result was impossible
because it was going to be a draw.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.973
There was no time available
for there to be a result.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.144
[commentator]
And now that we have got cricket,

22:34.227 --> 22:35.562
what are we to make of it?

22:37.064 --> 22:40.108
I think it will be a case a little bit
of going through the motions.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.867
Such a pity because this match
promised so much.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.706
Very, very frustrating.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.628
Now, there is a situation in cricket
where if you are the batting captain,

22:59.711 --> 23:01.838
you can simply
declare your innings closed.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.634
Usually, that's done when you think
you've got enough runs to win the game.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.889
But it wasn't something
that was gonna happen that day.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.935
South Africa didn't have enough runs
to win the game.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.941
So when we saw Nasser Hussain,
England's captain, running off the field

23:21.024 --> 23:22.526
to talk to Hansie Cronje,

23:23.485 --> 23:24.861
they surprised everybody.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.990
[commentator]
I think we have a declaration.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.536
We're not bluffing you, it has happened.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.290
[Jonathan]
Word got out about what happened.

23:37.999 --> 23:41.503
It was a negotiation.
Hansie Cronje said to Nasser Hussain,

23:41.586 --> 23:45.215
"You forfeit your first innings,
we'll forfeit our second innings."

23:45.298 --> 23:48.510
"We will set you
so many runs to win this match."

23:49.845 --> 23:53.974
Hansie Cronje has offered England
an opportunity to try and win the game.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.601
[commentator] I think it's terrific.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.728
A a good gesture
from the two captains.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.982
It, uh, creates interest
from a game that was stone-dead.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.864
[Simon Wilde] In the press box,
there's general incredulity

24:08.947 --> 24:10.824
that this had been done at all.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.578
[commentator] There have never been 
two forfeits before in a test match.

24:14.661 --> 24:15.871
[Simon] There was no precedent.

24:15.954 --> 24:21.334
In 125 years of test cricket,
it hadn't happened before.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.256
[Herschelle] That was completely bizarre.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.843
[chuckling] I didn't even know
you were allowed to do that in cricket.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.846
[commentator]
And there comes the South Africans.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.766
[Simon] England needs to score 249
to win the match.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.438
[Allan] I thought,
"That is a very, very generous target."

24:44.649 --> 24:49.321
The decision didn't sit well with me,
because not in a million years

24:49.404 --> 24:52.073
would I give England
even a sniff of winning.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.700
I-- I just wouldn't do it.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.496
[commentator]
That is a good shot well-stopped.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.915
Cronje, leading from the front.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.917
The cricket that followed was a good game.

25:02.709 --> 25:06.379
[commentator] That's four runs.
It's crashed away by Hussain.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.257
[Allan] England really 
got out the blocks quickly.

25:10.008 --> 25:13.094
-[commentator] And that's four more.
-Then South Africa's on top.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.347
-[commentator] In the air!
-[crowd cheering]

25:15.430 --> 25:18.391
Brilliantly caught
by a diving Herschelle Gibbs.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.229
And it was a very seesaw battle
at that stage.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.273
[commentator] That is the breakthrough
that South Africa wanted.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.945
Gone for a big one,
and it is a big one. It's six runs.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.244
[Simon] England get to within
striking distance of the target.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.419
[commentator]
Four more runs is gonna help a-plenty.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.177
[Simon] England then stumble,
lose some late wickets.

25:58.431 --> 25:59.849
[commentator] He's giving him out!

25:59.933 --> 26:01.977
It went right down to the wire.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.020
[commentator] What drama!

26:11.361 --> 26:15.824
Pulled away back up for four,
and England win.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.289
Hansie Cronje,
obviously disappointed in losing.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.165
You can see that in his face.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.753
[Allan] I rang him after the game
and he just said to me,

26:28.837 --> 26:30.672
"It's a gamble I wanted to take."

26:30.755 --> 26:32.716
"We could've been
on the other end of that."

26:32.799 --> 26:35.176
You know, that's it.
It's captain's prerogative.

26:37.971 --> 26:41.308
[Jonathan] I felt that Hansie Cronje
had done us all a favor

26:41.391 --> 26:43.143
and done cricket a favor, frankly.

26:43.226 --> 26:45.687
Rather than just consigning a game

26:46.229 --> 26:47.397
to utter tedium,

26:48.106 --> 26:49.107
he brought it to life.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.778
[reporter] Hansie, it may seem odd
to say congratulations after a defeat,

26:53.862 --> 26:56.364
but this has been a special day
for the game, I think.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.699
I think the game needed it.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.160
We owed it to the public
to get out and be positive,

27:00.243 --> 27:02.495
and seeing that the players
wanna play cricket…

27:02.579 --> 27:05.248
[Simon] Captains did make 
generous declarations to test cricket,

27:05.332 --> 27:06.916
but never this generous.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.001
[muted]

27:10.837 --> 27:14.007
I was sufficiently intrigued
by the whole thing

27:14.090 --> 27:18.011
that I went and spoke to some
of the England players back at the hotel.

27:20.555 --> 27:24.059
I found out Cronje had made
three offers to Nasser,

27:24.142 --> 27:25.810
and he reduced the target

27:26.770 --> 27:31.358
by quite a bit actually by the time
he got to the one that England went for.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.277
Didn't make sense at all.

27:35.737 --> 27:36.696
Why had he done it?

27:42.744 --> 27:45.205
[Marlon] I should never
have been able to get close to him.

27:51.419 --> 27:55.006
My name is Marlon Aronstam.
I was a bookmaker in South Africa.

27:57.342 --> 28:01.096
In the Centurion Test,
I was in a restaurant in Johannesburg.

28:03.431 --> 28:07.060
And I said to somebody, "I have an idea.
Let's make this game alive."

28:07.560 --> 28:10.230
"I'm gonna call Hansie
and tell him to declare."

28:13.983 --> 28:16.111
You could make money on that event

28:16.194 --> 28:19.114
if you knew 
that it's gonna take place for sure.

28:22.575 --> 28:25.829
I just dialed a telephone number,
which I still remember today,

28:25.912 --> 28:28.123
which was 788-188.

28:28.206 --> 28:31.251
It was the telephone number
of the South African Cricket Board,

28:31.334 --> 28:34.337
I said, "Can I please have
Hansie Cronje's telephone number?"

28:34.421 --> 28:35.547
They gave it to me.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.133
[suspenseful music playing]

28:38.758 --> 28:41.469
[ringing]

28:41.553 --> 28:42.929
I called Hansie.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.265
Told him I'm a business man
interested in cricket

28:45.348 --> 28:49.102
and I'm prepared to make a donation to
charity if he can organize a declaration.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.399
He was happy to talk to me.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.234
"Come and see me."

28:58.820 --> 29:00.029
I go up to his room.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.658
He opens the door
and there's, uh… like, a suite.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.912
We sit in the lounge area
and we started to talk.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.956
And he liked the proposal.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.589
He said he would speak
to Nasser in the morning,

29:17.672 --> 29:20.467
and they'll discuss the possibilities.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.346
[commentator]
We're just gonna go through the motions.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.433
I think it will be a case a bit
of going through the motions.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.647
[Marlon] The next morning,
I have contact from Hansie

29:34.731 --> 29:37.025
by text message at 9:30 in the morning:

29:37.108 --> 29:38.401
Nasser's not interested.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.697
[commentator] Such a pity
because, uh, this match promised so much.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.202
Somewhere around 11:15 to 11:30…

29:49.537 --> 29:50.789
he sent me a message.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.708
"The deal is on."

29:53.792 --> 29:55.919
[commentator]
I think we have a declaration.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.172
We're not bluffing you, it has happened.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.594
[Marlon] I got in the car and rushed off
to Centurion to watch the match.

30:05.094 --> 30:09.390
As Hansie started coming up the stairs,
and he sees me and he winks at me,

30:10.225 --> 30:11.351
I knew the game's on.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.564
It was an exciting game of cricket.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.610
I probably won about 15,000 rand.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.533
In U.S. dollars, at the time,
it probably was about 2,500.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.077
I'd call that Mickey Mouse money.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.872
Nasser didn't know we'd made a deal.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.959
Had we known in the morning,
at nine o'clock,

30:36.042 --> 30:37.335
that Nasser was gonna agree…

30:38.169 --> 30:40.672
we'd have started betting
that it will not be a draw.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.007
We could've made a million rand.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.928
[interviewer]
Did any money get given to charity?

30:47.011 --> 30:47.846
No.

30:50.598 --> 30:52.725
[interviewer]
It was a way of having him meet you.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.648
I wanna answer all your questions
like you want them.

30:58.731 --> 31:02.986
But you wanna go routes which is not
what I wanna go down that same route.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.948
[interviewer] Okay. What happened next?

31:07.031 --> 31:09.784
[intense music playing]

31:13.496 --> 31:15.790
[Marlon]
We started to talk regularly after that.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.958
We became friends.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.836
When South Africa went off to India,

31:19.919 --> 31:23.047
I told him that if ever he needs to know
where to go, go out to bars,

31:23.131 --> 31:26.467
I think I said I can get somebody
to help him and show him around.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.054
[man] Hansie! Hansie! It's me!

31:31.014 --> 31:35.727
[Allan] Arriving in India, thousands
and thousands of Indian supporters.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.647
It was immense. It really was immense.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.112
[Simon] In India, cricket is massive.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.073
Millions of people watch cricket.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.786
It's a billion-dollar industry.

31:56.539 --> 32:00.668
Wherever we moved, there was
thousands of people around the team

32:00.752 --> 32:04.547
and they just wanted
to get a glimpse of what we look like.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.219
That noise,
just the excitement and atmosphere.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.096
[crowd roaring] 

32:12.180 --> 32:16.809
It was sensational to actually play
when the crowd is that big and that loud.

32:16.893 --> 32:17.852
It was phenomenal.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.063
And Hansie really loved it.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.857
[reporter]
The noise here gonna create problems?

32:22.941 --> 32:26.778
It was pretty quiet during test matches
but certainly gonna be noisy,

32:26.861 --> 32:29.739
just gonna try and stay together
and communicate all the time.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.616
[Marlon] Cricket in India is a religion.

32:31.699 --> 32:35.411
The people's entertainment
is watching cricket and betting on it.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.796
You can't place a bet in India on cricket,
not legally anyway.

32:46.547 --> 32:49.467
But there is this vast network
of illegal bookmaking.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.303
[Marlon] The market is huge.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.139
The betting industry in India
is worth millions.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.769
A lot of rich people putting
bets of $300,000 on a game of cricket.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.856
The Indian market
bet who's gonna win the game.

33:04.691 --> 33:08.194
And then they could get a bet on anything
to do with the game of cricket.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.198
What will be the total runs
scored for the innings?

33:12.865 --> 33:17.370
What will be the score of the 15-overs,
30-overs, and 50-overs?

33:18.788 --> 33:22.667
One can bet on whether a player
walks on the field with a watch on or not,

33:22.750 --> 33:24.085
with long sleeves or not.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.296
Who's going to open the bowling
or who's gonna bowl number three?

33:28.423 --> 33:29.966
[Marlon] They bet who won the toss.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.222
[Simon] Bookies will try and influence
the situation in their favor.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.519
So they target the captains

33:41.602 --> 33:44.981
because they are
the most influential people on the pitch.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.153
A cricket captain can ask a groundsman
for a particular type of pitch,

33:50.236 --> 33:53.573
you're involved in selection,
so you can affect who plays,

33:53.656 --> 33:56.451
put his fielders where he likes.
He can decide who bowls when.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.623
He has huge amount of control in a way
that doesn't apply in any other sport.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.334
So if you want to influence things,

34:05.418 --> 34:08.296
then the captain is head and shoulders
above everyone else

34:08.379 --> 34:10.506
in terms of the guy
you should be aiming for.

34:12.341 --> 34:17.263
I told Hansie I can set him up to meet
somebody in India and, the next morning,

34:18.097 --> 34:19.182
I spoke to Hansie.

34:21.142 --> 34:23.853
And he was on the bus
and he just said to me,

34:24.812 --> 34:26.939
"Forget it. We're not doing anything."

34:29.275 --> 34:32.236
Hansie wanted to win
in the subcontinent, in India.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.323
[commentator] Great shot
and the end of the match.

34:35.406 --> 34:39.452
He's taken it away with a six.
South Africa has won the game.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.041
For South Africa to go to India and win

34:45.625 --> 34:48.753
was a remarkable achievement.

34:48.836 --> 34:50.129
[woman] Well done.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.341
[Jonathan] The team came back from India
to a hero's welcome.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.301
[boy] Could you sign this whole page here?

34:55.384 --> 34:56.594
And all seemed well.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.679
[both laughing]

34:59.555 --> 35:00.556
Hansie.

35:01.766 --> 35:05.728
[Bertha] When Hansie came home,
he just didn't want to talk about cricket.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.943
He said he wanted to just relax
and leave that at the office.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.486
[Bertha laughing]

35:16.197 --> 35:18.282
For me, the cricket took him away.

35:19.325 --> 35:23.079
You know, I think I remember there was
one year that he was at home 28 days.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.375
So time together was precious.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.632
We had just moved
into our house by the sea.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.761
I remember we were
on our way to go to the beach.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.931
It was something new for us,
coming from Bloemfontein.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.851
We can go to the beach,
it's right there, and, um…

35:44.934 --> 35:46.185
the phone rang.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.396
And all I can remember

35:49.147 --> 35:51.190
hearing him say, "It's rubbish."

35:54.694 --> 35:59.115
The Delhi police has registered
a case of criminal conspiracy,

35:59.198 --> 36:03.619
fraud, and cheating against certain
individuals of Indian nationality

36:03.703 --> 36:06.664
and the South African
cricket captain Hansie Cronje.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.544
[reporter] Cronje and three other members
of the national team

36:11.627 --> 36:15.464
are alleged by Indian authorities
to have been involved in match-fixing

36:15.548 --> 36:18.217
during South Africa's
recent tour of India.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.179
Captain Hansie Cronje
was approached to throw a match in India.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.015
[reporter 2] Allegations 
that national captain Hansie Cronje

36:24.098 --> 36:25.975
was involved in match fixing

36:26.058 --> 36:28.561
in the recent
one-day series against India.

36:29.103 --> 36:32.398
[Bertha] He said it's not true,
doesn't know where it comes from.

36:32.481 --> 36:35.568
But I could see that
he was really upset about this.

36:35.651 --> 36:38.446
[inquisitive music playing]

36:39.947 --> 36:41.115
Cronje?

36:41.908 --> 36:45.077
It seemed to be completely impossible.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.669
I was shocked about the statements
that the Delhi police was making.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.671
Hansie Cronje…

36:55.755 --> 36:57.965
[Allan] I just thought it was a big joke,
to be honest.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.218
And, uh, I couldn't get a hold of Hansie.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.261
I immediately rang his brother.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.680
We just all thought
this is absolutely absurd.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.057
It can't be true.

37:06.140 --> 37:10.478
And Hansie also said, "No, it's not true."
So that's it. You know, finished.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.944
[Godlam] I got a call
from the South African Cricket Board.

37:18.569 --> 37:23.241
It was Dr. Ali Bacher, and Ali said to me,
"What do you know about this?"

37:23.324 --> 37:26.744
I said, "Ali, it's the first time
I'm hearing of it."

37:28.663 --> 37:29.997
"Now as I'm seeing it."

37:32.458 --> 37:34.502
"You mean you don't know anything?"

37:35.127 --> 37:38.089
I said, "I swear I don't know anything."

37:38.881 --> 37:40.967
The allegations are outrageous.

37:41.968 --> 37:47.640
Hansie Cronje is a man
of unquestionable honesty and integrity.

37:47.723 --> 37:52.186
I'm absolutely certain not one
of our players would ever contemplate

37:52.270 --> 37:53.980
being involved in match-fixing.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.982
[reporter] I was wondering,
could you describe

37:56.065 --> 37:58.442
Hansie Cronje's character for us?

37:58.526 --> 38:03.864
I said early on, he is a man
of unquestionable integrity and honesty.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.659
It's libelous.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.702
It's defamatory.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.419
[reporter] There's been indignation 
and disbelief across South Africa

38:16.502 --> 38:19.297
that Indian police
could accuse Cronje of being involved

38:19.380 --> 38:22.717
in what they've described
as a massive international crime.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.429
The South African government
has sent a firmly worded "please explain"

38:26.512 --> 38:30.474
to their Indian counterparts,
demanding access to the telephone taps

38:30.558 --> 38:34.061
that allegedly implicate Cronje
with the match-fixing masterminds,

38:34.145 --> 38:36.147
one of whom is now under arrest,

38:36.230 --> 38:39.150
claiming to have organized
the half-million-dollar scam.

38:40.568 --> 38:44.989
We are saying that our players
are innocent until proven guilty.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.741
Just like any other person.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.159
[Simon] It was a mistake.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.745
Didn't make sense at all.

38:51.329 --> 38:56.417
Why were the police in India
bugging the phones of a cricketer?

39:11.766 --> 39:13.642
My name is Pradeep Srivastava.

39:14.226 --> 39:17.646
And I was Deputy Commissioner
of Police Crime Branch

39:17.730 --> 39:20.274
in Delhi Police in the year 2000.

39:21.067 --> 39:24.987
The Crime Branch
looks after more serious crimes.

39:26.322 --> 39:29.408
Extortion, kidnapping, killing.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.037
We started working on some extortion case.

39:34.288 --> 39:39.377
Permission was given to permit recording
of the calls of suspected criminals.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.422
Technology was actually very raw.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.093
Two wires and cassette attached to that.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.638
No one knows what time anyone can call,

39:50.721 --> 39:54.100
so two persons round the clock
listening to the phone.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.769
[tape deck clicks]

39:59.772 --> 40:02.358
[Pradeep]
This was one of the most unusual things.

40:04.193 --> 40:09.240
Instead of finding any extortion racket,
it is something else which is going on.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.786
[Ishwar] What we're hearing is,

40:13.869 --> 40:16.414
you invest so much,
how much you have invested,

40:16.497 --> 40:19.500
how so and so player is playing
or how we will play.

40:20.709 --> 40:25.297
Why did you not lift the ball up?
Why did you not take the catch?

40:26.215 --> 40:27.299
[tape deck clicks]

40:28.968 --> 40:31.846
They are not talking
of terrorism or extortion.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.722
They are talking about cricket.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.936
[tape deck clicks]

40:41.522 --> 40:43.065
There were two parties.

40:44.066 --> 40:48.779
One was speaking
in a very accentuated foreign accent.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.783
But this voice, I could not recognize.

40:52.867 --> 40:53.951
[tape deck clicks]

40:55.035 --> 40:56.620
I took the cassette home.

40:57.955 --> 41:01.208
I kept it in my study
where we have the music system.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.882
My children were
very keen fans of cricket.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.926
That night, they asked me, 
"Why do you have, uh,

41:11.010 --> 41:14.221
Hansie Cronje's, uh, voice 
on the recorder?"

41:18.100 --> 41:20.936
And what had happened
a couple of days back,

41:21.020 --> 41:24.064
Hansie was speaking on the television.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.234
India's playing good cricket
at the moment…

41:27.318 --> 41:30.070
[Pradeep] They had remembered 
his style of speaking,

41:30.154 --> 41:32.364
his pronunciation, his accent.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.576
So this was, without doubt,

41:35.659 --> 41:39.830
a communication related to
the ongoing cricket matches.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.837
Tapes were being recorded
more intently now.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.675
There is an Indian party.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.765
And they have asked him
to do certain things.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.531
I was surprised.

42:14.490 --> 42:19.370
Hansie Cronje was one of the most
important cricketers of that time.

42:19.453 --> 42:23.541
So getting anything on him
was a very major breakthrough.

42:24.083 --> 42:26.252
-Hi. How are you?
-[reporter] You won't talk to us now?

42:26.335 --> 42:29.088
I-- I've got an interview
at, uh, seven o'clock tonight.

42:29.755 --> 42:34.885
The next four days, the demand
for information on Cronje was massive.

42:34.969 --> 42:38.264
The only theory
that I think will clear my name,

42:38.347 --> 42:40.349
is if you speak to the players

42:40.975 --> 42:44.603
and if you, um, check my… cash,

42:44.687 --> 42:45.729
bank accounts.

42:45.813 --> 42:50.276
I have not received any money and I have
never ever spoken to any of the players.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.154
[Frans] Hansie was not himself.

42:55.030 --> 42:57.575
We realized the tension that he was under.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.412
My dad called Hansie
and said, "What's happening?"

43:01.495 --> 43:04.999
Hansie said, "No, Dad, don't worry
about it. There's nothing in this."

43:06.625 --> 43:08.586
And then they said, "Goodbye."

43:09.086 --> 43:11.505
And my dad forgot to put his phone off.

43:11.589 --> 43:15.175
So his phone was still on and he turned
to my mother and he said to my mother,

43:15.259 --> 43:18.137
"I think Hansie is lying.
I think he was involved in something."

43:18.220 --> 43:19.847
And Hansie heard my dad saying it.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.391
[tense music playing]

43:24.393 --> 43:28.731
[Rory] Around this time,
Australia are playing in South Africa.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.400
I was providing security.

43:33.652 --> 43:35.863
And both teams are in the same hotel.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.994
Half past two in the morning,
the phone rings.

43:42.077 --> 43:45.789
"Rory, it's Hansie.
Could you please come up to my room?"

43:48.250 --> 43:51.754
Over the years, Hansie and I
have become quite good friends.

43:53.505 --> 43:54.673
I ran upstairs.

43:55.549 --> 43:58.552
And… all the lights are on in his suite.

44:00.387 --> 44:01.930
There's a kit bag packed.

44:02.806 --> 44:06.602
And as I walk in, he's holding up
this piece of paper towards me.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.021
It was a handwritten statement.

44:11.982 --> 44:14.610
He seems uptight, emotional,

44:15.110 --> 44:17.529
saying to me that some of the stuff

44:17.613 --> 44:20.240
that is being said in the newspapers
is actually true.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.953
All he wanted to do was get away.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.711
I convinced him we need
to get the team manager up there.

44:34.421 --> 44:37.633
This was serious. It was explosive.
He needs to speak to him.

44:38.592 --> 44:39.843
I can't believe this.

44:40.302 --> 44:41.512
Not Hansie.

44:44.139 --> 44:48.435
I looked at him
and I saw a face that I never saw before.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.189
I said to him,

44:52.773 --> 44:54.692
"I will never talk to you again."

44:57.027 --> 45:00.155
[Dr. Bacher] At three o'clock
this morning, I was phoned.

45:01.865 --> 45:06.036
Goolam Rajah handed the phone
over to Hansie Cronje

45:07.121 --> 45:09.748
who said to me that, um…

45:10.499 --> 45:12.376
he had not been honest

45:12.459 --> 45:15.254
with regard to these allegations.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.757
[reporter]
Cronje putting his hand up

45:18.841 --> 45:21.677
and making the admission 
that he'd accepted money.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.887
But he continues to deny match-fixing.

45:28.767 --> 45:30.519
[Ali] Let us say unequivocally…

45:32.104 --> 45:34.815
that we in South African cricket
are shattered.

45:35.899 --> 45:39.737
We will say unequivocally
that the United Cricket Board

45:40.571 --> 45:42.531
and the government have been deceived.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.743
[reporter 2] This is a real bombshell.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.870
[reporter 3] It's a startling revelation.

45:48.746 --> 45:52.249
[reporter 4] News of Hansie Cronje's
dismissal as the South African captain

45:52.332 --> 45:54.543
is now starting to filter out 
across the country

45:54.626 --> 45:56.962
and is being met with utter disbelief.

45:57.629 --> 46:01.008
No matter what they say about him,
I will always support Hansie.

46:01.091 --> 46:02.718
He should be accountable for what he did.

46:02.801 --> 46:05.637
I wouldn't believe
he has done such a thing but,

46:06.388 --> 46:08.849
if he has, it's a big regret.

46:08.932 --> 46:10.225
This was massive.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.227
-Not guilty.
-[kids] Not guilty.

46:12.978 --> 46:13.854
[Allan] As kids…

46:15.189 --> 46:18.108
we wanted to set
ourselves up as role models.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.486
Now you're telling me this.

46:22.029 --> 46:26.784
Next to Mandela, Hansie was probably
the next highest regarded citizen.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.076
It was a huge deal.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.746
[Ali] He's brought shame
to the game quite clearly.

46:30.829 --> 46:33.665
[reporter] So why did Cronje
apparently lie in his first statements?

46:33.749 --> 46:36.460
[Ali] It's not clear exactly
what his confession involved.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.088
[Simon] If it goes any further,

46:40.172 --> 46:43.383
it's the most devastating thing
in cricket in the last 100 years.

46:45.260 --> 46:46.428
[Allan] Now what's next?

46:48.305 --> 46:51.391
Was I part of something
that shouldn't have happened?

46:52.893 --> 46:54.353
How serious is this thing?

46:55.896 --> 46:58.148
There were so many unanswered questions.

46:59.566 --> 47:02.361
The nation had to know what was going on.

47:02.444 --> 47:04.613
[man]
The integrity of the game is at stake.

47:04.696 --> 47:07.574
-[man 2] There will be questions asked.
-[Jon] Is he now telling the truth?

47:07.658 --> 47:09.368
[man 3]
We need to get to the bottom of this.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.585
[reporter] It's the first day 
of a special inquiry

47:18.669 --> 47:19.837
taking place in Cape Town.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.465
The former South African cricket captain,
Hansie Cronje, has already admitted

47:23.549 --> 47:27.511
taking money from a bookmaker,
but he's denied trying to fix the matches.

47:27.594 --> 47:31.431
[suspenseful music playing]

47:32.558 --> 47:35.060
[Simon] We got a couple of days' notice
Cronje was gonna appear.

47:36.270 --> 47:39.773
There was cameras, journalists.
We were waiting to be allowed in.

47:39.857 --> 47:44.111
And he'd been spirited into the building
without anyone having a chance to see him.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.868
I was sent to report on this.

47:52.202 --> 47:56.498
A nation gripped on the day
that Cronje appeared to give his evidence.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.718
[Frans]
It was going to be a closed commission.

48:07.801 --> 48:11.388
But in the end, they decided
it's going to be live on television.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.559
You can't describe how tough it was.

48:21.607 --> 48:24.610
[Jonathan] He was given immunity 
from prosecution,

48:25.360 --> 48:27.279
so therefore he couldn't go to prison.

48:27.362 --> 48:30.198
What was he going to say?
How much would he say?

48:30.282 --> 48:31.867
How is he going to explain it?

48:33.285 --> 48:34.703
We were all waiting.

48:38.832 --> 48:41.168
[woman] I'm going to deal
with the Centurion issue now.

48:44.671 --> 48:47.341
First, the call
you received from Mr. Aronstam.

48:52.387 --> 48:55.474
Mr. Aronstam was a stranger to you,
and on your own evidence,

48:55.557 --> 48:58.477
you had not previously
heard of or spoken to him.

49:00.354 --> 49:03.106
Why were you prepared
to invite him up to your room?

49:06.193 --> 49:10.030
Mr. Aronstam said to me
that, um, he was a cricket lover

49:10.113 --> 49:14.576
and he was interested in getting a match
on at Centurion the following day,

49:14.660 --> 49:17.329
and he had a suggestion
and he wanted to meet me.

49:18.246 --> 49:22.376
I didn't realize it was quite so easy
to meet the national captain off the side.

49:25.295 --> 49:28.632
Did it ever occur to you
that Mr. Aronstam's interest

49:29.341 --> 49:33.053
in making a game of it might
actually benefit him in his gambling?

49:34.388 --> 49:36.515
It may have done but, I mean, what…

49:37.391 --> 49:41.144
What good can it do when you're not sure
what the end result is going to be?

49:41.812 --> 49:44.356
[man] I think
it will help immensely, Mr. Cronje.

49:44.940 --> 49:49.194
That could be very, very meaningful 
information to somebody who is interested

49:49.277 --> 49:51.947
in betting on the outcome
of the game, surely.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.535
[interviewer] Was Centurion fixed?

49:58.328 --> 50:02.082
Define the word "fixed." The act?
The final outcome? Definitely not.

50:03.625 --> 50:06.920
Because when you know the outcome,
you know for sure what's gonna happen.

50:07.796 --> 50:11.258
To this day, I've never known for sure
in a cricket game what's gonna happen.

50:13.051 --> 50:14.052
[Simon] It was fixed,

50:15.095 --> 50:17.806
because there should be
three results possible,

50:18.306 --> 50:20.600
South Africa win, England win, a draw.

50:20.684 --> 50:24.771
But Cronje was determined that the draw
would not be one of those three options.

50:25.647 --> 50:27.566
That-- that's a fix, surely.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.902
[Jonathan] He interfered with it.

50:30.986 --> 50:32.612
He manipulated the game.

50:33.947 --> 50:35.157
So why did he do it?

50:38.035 --> 50:42.080
After the game, I had a leather jacket,
which I bought for my wife,

50:42.164 --> 50:43.790
but I bought the wrong size.

50:44.499 --> 50:45.459
I brought the jacket.

50:45.542 --> 50:48.253
I said, "I've got a nice present
for you to give to Bertha."

50:49.129 --> 50:51.965
I gave it to him
with 50,000 rand in a bank bag.

50:52.674 --> 50:56.011
And that money was paid
for future information to come.

50:57.012 --> 51:00.515
[Hansie] Uh, I wasn't expecting to receive
any money from Mr. Aronstam.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.895
So when he gave you 50,000 rand,
you must have been absolutely shocked.

51:05.562 --> 51:07.939
I thought this was
a very generous man, yeah.

51:11.401 --> 51:13.862
[Jonathan]
Cronje admitted to taking money.

51:13.945 --> 51:18.283
But the picture was much bigger
than that match at Centurion.

51:21.870 --> 51:24.289
[Marlon] I didn't ask for immunity
for giving evidence.

51:24.372 --> 51:25.582
I've got nothing to hide.

51:27.375 --> 51:30.003
[man] If I read your statement correctly,

51:30.087 --> 51:33.882
"As I was leaving, Mr. Cronje said to me,

51:33.965 --> 51:37.135
how is it possible for him
to make any money out of cricket?

51:37.761 --> 51:39.179
I replied by saying,

51:40.055 --> 51:41.973
'The ball is in your court.'"

51:42.557 --> 51:44.226
Is that statement correct?

51:44.309 --> 51:46.019
One thousand percent correct.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.066
[Marlon]
I called friends of mine afterwards.

51:51.149 --> 51:54.361
I said, "I've been telling you
for a long time cricket could be crook."

51:55.821 --> 51:58.949
"I'm telling you it is crook.
I've just come out of Hansie's room.

51:59.032 --> 52:01.034
The man's offered to throw cricket games."

52:01.618 --> 52:04.371
He started to explain what he could do.
He could lose a game.

52:04.454 --> 52:06.748
"The best way to make money
is to lose a game."

52:08.708 --> 52:11.670
[Marlon] I told Hansie, I can set him up
to meet somebody in India.

52:11.753 --> 52:14.965
And he said to me,
"Forget it. We're not doing anything."

52:15.048 --> 52:17.884
And we didn't know why,
which we found out afterwards why.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.888
He had met another party
and they had offered him a lot more money.

52:28.603 --> 52:31.481
[reporter] It must send shock waves
through the whole cricket world,

52:31.565 --> 52:32.774
and you've got to wonder…

52:32.858 --> 52:35.652
[man] I'm devastated. 
Everybody trusted Hansie.

52:35.735 --> 52:38.405
[man 2]
And it's just extremely disappointing.

52:38.488 --> 52:41.741
[Bertha] Every day when he got back,
he didn't want to talk or want to eat.

52:41.825 --> 52:45.036
He would climb in his bed
and… try to sleep.

52:49.457 --> 52:53.378
In the middle of the night,
I had to change the sheets of the bed

52:53.461 --> 52:56.631
because it was so… 
it was wet from his, um…

52:57.257 --> 52:58.842
his perspiring so much.

53:03.263 --> 53:08.226
I used to write Bible verses on little
pieces of cotton and put it on the mirror,

53:08.310 --> 53:10.687
so when he shaved he could look at them.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.273
But nothing could reassure him.

53:14.941 --> 53:18.945
At one stage I just asked him,
"Is there anything else, um…

53:19.946 --> 53:25.493
that you need to say? Because, you know,
you-- you haven't been completely honest."

53:28.455 --> 53:30.749
[reporter] When Herschelle Gibbs,
in the light-colored suit,

53:30.832 --> 53:33.752
arrived for day two of the inquiry
into corruption in the game,

53:33.835 --> 53:36.087
only a few knew of the massive body blow

53:36.171 --> 53:38.423
he was about to deliver
to South African cricket.

53:41.551 --> 53:44.054
[Herschelle]
The morning of the King Commission,

53:44.137 --> 53:46.264
I remember walking into the court.

53:46.973 --> 53:48.600
It was properly full.

53:54.272 --> 53:55.398
Man, I was nervous.

53:57.609 --> 53:59.444
[reporter]
Gibbs sat nervously inside the hall

53:59.527 --> 54:03.281
before television cameras were excluded
for his sensational testimony.

54:09.704 --> 54:11.831
[Herschelle]
We were in the hotel in India.

54:12.916 --> 54:15.669
I get a knock on the door
and Hansie walks in.

54:17.837 --> 54:19.965
I'm not sure even
how the conversation started.

54:20.048 --> 54:23.426
He said, "Look, I've got a mate
that wants to offer you $15,000

54:23.510 --> 54:25.345
if you'd score less than 20."

54:27.097 --> 54:30.183
And within like a split second,
within a split second,

54:30.267 --> 54:32.560
I said, "Yes." You know, I said, "Fine."

54:34.729 --> 54:37.315
He realized what sort of character I was,

54:37.399 --> 54:40.360
and I was happy to do anything
at least once

54:40.443 --> 54:43.863
without even knowing
or thinking of the consequences.

54:46.032 --> 54:48.785
Then he turned to Henry Williams,
my roommate.

54:50.495 --> 54:52.372
He said, "I'll do it as well."

54:53.915 --> 54:56.376
Two minutes later,
Hansie's gone out the door.

54:57.335 --> 55:01.214
Now I'm looking at Henry
and he's looking at me and we're going…

55:02.257 --> 55:04.968
You know, we don't really know
what to say to one another.

55:09.180 --> 55:11.182
From the hotel room to the field…

55:13.184 --> 55:14.728
it was quite a long drive.

55:15.478 --> 55:17.105
I had a lot to think about.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.777
The crowds are very intimidating.

55:26.823 --> 55:29.701
I got to the field,
and I didn't know what to do.

55:47.594 --> 55:49.804
[crowd roaring]

55:49.888 --> 55:51.848
[dramatic music playing]

56:06.821 --> 56:10.950
I said to myself,
"No. I'm not going to go through with it."

56:13.161 --> 56:15.663
You know, and I end up getting 74.

56:22.796 --> 56:25.757
Henry only bowled like three overs
and got injured.

56:27.509 --> 56:28.843
He went off the field.

56:31.471 --> 56:32.430
We won the game.

56:34.349 --> 56:36.935
About a day or two afterwards,
Hansie said to me,

56:37.018 --> 56:40.313
"That particular person, my friend,
he lost about 20 million dollars,"

56:40.397 --> 56:41.731
apparently, in that game.

56:46.903 --> 56:50.156
[Simon] It's the blackest mark 
against him, really, in the whole story.

56:51.491 --> 56:54.869
He tried to corrupt
two young, non-white players,

56:54.953 --> 56:57.330
Henry Williams and Herschelle Gibbs.

56:58.998 --> 57:02.419
And that's about as bad a thing
you can do in South Africa.

57:03.878 --> 57:07.465
He went against everything that Cronje's
role was supposed to involve, really,

57:07.549 --> 57:11.177
which is nurturing a multicultural team
in multicultural South Africa.

57:14.764 --> 57:17.600
[Jonathan] He put both their careers
absolutely on the line,

57:17.684 --> 57:19.394
and they both were suspended.

57:20.311 --> 57:23.982
That was a really worrying insight
into Cronje's tactics.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.028
But I honestly don't think
that Cronje was a bad man,

57:29.612 --> 57:33.366
and for him to… be reduced…

57:34.576 --> 57:37.954
to putting so much pressure
on… Gibbs and Williams,

57:38.037 --> 57:41.958
I think illustrates actually
the sort of pressure that he was under

57:42.459 --> 57:44.961
and how tight those bookmakers
were turning the screw.

57:49.132 --> 57:51.468
[Simon] The evidence
of the King Commission is that bookies

57:51.551 --> 57:55.847
will often give the players something,
seemingly, for nothing.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.351
Easy money,
and you think, "Well, why not?"

58:01.311 --> 58:02.145
[attorney] Now,

58:03.021 --> 58:05.482
what I'm trying to figure out is why

58:05.565 --> 58:08.193
you have an offer of $30,000…

58:09.444 --> 58:12.655
to ensure that you lost
when that was almost a certainty anyway.

58:13.406 --> 58:15.658
I was trying to rationalize to myself,

58:15.742 --> 58:19.913
um, when I took the money,
that this was in fact a very stupid…

58:21.080 --> 58:21.915
uh, bet.

58:21.998 --> 58:26.794
I really couldn't understand why
somebody would give me 30,000 U.S. dollars

58:26.878 --> 58:30.006
for a match that I thought
we were going to lose anyway.

58:33.384 --> 58:35.595
[Jonathan] Once you've taken
the money from bookmakers…

58:37.222 --> 58:40.767
well, you've had it, really.
I mean, you are totally open to blackmail.

58:42.185 --> 58:45.480
I'm told that once the bookies got you,
they got you for life.

58:48.608 --> 58:53.154
[Simon] Essentially, the story began
within six months of becoming captain.

58:54.989 --> 58:56.574
Which was astonishing, really.

58:56.658 --> 58:59.410
It seemed incredible
that it had gone back so far.

59:00.870 --> 59:03.206
[attorney 2] 
Have you disclosed everything?

59:03.289 --> 59:04.290
Yes.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.879
I cannot tell you
the huge shame that it's caused me,

59:10.713 --> 59:15.510
the great passion I have for my country,
great passion I have for my teammates,

59:16.553 --> 59:19.055
and the unfortunate love I have for money.

59:20.098 --> 59:22.350
I… do like money.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.061
I'm not trying to get away from that.

59:26.145 --> 59:26.980
Yes.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.816
I accepted money from bookmakers.

59:29.899 --> 59:32.485
Yes, I was trying
to feed them information.

59:34.237 --> 59:37.073
But I promise you 
every time I walked onto the field

59:37.156 --> 59:38.908
I gave my all for South Africa.

59:41.369 --> 59:44.163
[dramatic music playing]

59:46.833 --> 59:48.084
[Hester] I couldn't believe it.

59:48.793 --> 59:50.295
And I still can't believe it.

59:51.421 --> 59:53.840
But… I wish I had known.

59:55.008 --> 59:57.510
Because then you would've been
there for him more often.

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:01.306
Sorry. [sniffles]

1:00:03.808 --> 1:00:05.685
[Frans] At the end of that process,

1:00:06.561 --> 1:00:07.812
Hansie got banned for life.

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:12.984
[attorney 2] Mr. Cronje,

1:00:13.776 --> 1:00:14.611
thank you.

1:00:20.867 --> 1:00:23.620
[dramatic music continues]

1:00:24.954 --> 1:00:27.040
[Frans] After breaking down,

1:00:27.123 --> 1:00:30.501
there was a small room,
and he just fell on his back.

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:33.588
And he just lay there
and he broke down crying.

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:34.714
He absolutely wept.

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:37.383
And he said, "Sorry."

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:39.844
He said it a hundred times.

1:00:40.386 --> 1:00:42.221
And he wanted to make it right.

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:52.857
[Bertha] Hansie loved cricket.

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:53.983
And he lost that.

1:00:54.942 --> 1:00:57.987
And it took him a long time
to get back on his feet.

1:01:00.698 --> 1:01:04.619
But after two years I could see
that the old Hansie was coming back.

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:09.207
He was enjoying things again.
He was living his life.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:14.337
Hansie had a job
at a company in Johannesburg.

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:18.508
I was excited to have him
home for the weekend.

1:01:18.591 --> 1:01:21.219
Hansie phoned and said
he's gonna miss his flight.

1:01:22.887 --> 1:01:26.307
And then he said to me
he managed to get on another flight.

1:01:28.935 --> 1:01:33.272
Seven o'clock came and nothing,
and by eight o'clock I thought,

1:01:33.356 --> 1:01:35.400
"No, something is seriously wrong."

1:01:42.907 --> 1:01:46.494
[reporter] Breaking news,
some tragic news from South Africa.

1:01:46.577 --> 1:01:49.414
[reporter 2] The former South Africa
cricket captain, Hansie Cronje,

1:01:49.497 --> 1:01:51.416
has been killed in a plane crash.

1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:54.502
[reporter 3]
The plane carrying Hansie Cronje

1:01:54.585 --> 1:01:56.045
was trying to land in poor weather

1:01:56.129 --> 1:01:58.881
when it came down high 
in a mountain range

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:00.758
in the Western Cape province.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:11.978
[Bertha] It was like a-- a nightmare.

1:02:16.357 --> 1:02:18.234
I was in such a…

1:02:19.694 --> 1:02:20.528
daze.

1:02:23.865 --> 1:02:27.368
[man] Put a hand out to one another.
All of our hearts are aching.

1:02:32.165 --> 1:02:34.417
I was overwhelmed
with the reaction of the people.

1:02:41.090 --> 1:02:43.468
[crowd chanting] Hansie! Hansie! Hansie!

1:02:43.551 --> 1:02:45.678
Hansie! Hansie! Hansie!

1:02:45.762 --> 1:02:48.055
Hansie! Hansie! Hansie!

1:02:48.139 --> 1:02:50.224
[crowd cheering]

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:56.022
[Mandela]
Hansie Cronje was one of the greatest

1:02:56.105 --> 1:02:58.024
cricket captains in our country.

1:02:59.192 --> 1:03:03.154
And, uh, he literally made us walk tall.

1:03:09.494 --> 1:03:12.163
[Bertha]
Even through everything that happened,

1:03:12.246 --> 1:03:14.707
nobody actually forgot who he was.

1:03:15.458 --> 1:03:18.252
They remembered his heart
like I knew his heart,

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.088
and that he was a good person.

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:28.763
[crowd cheering]

1:03:28.846 --> 1:03:30.973
[Herschelle]
He lived by the mistakes he made.

1:03:31.057 --> 1:03:32.767
Jeez, he didn't kill anybody.

1:03:34.018 --> 1:03:34.977
I mean, fuck it.

1:03:36.312 --> 1:03:37.647
He didn't kill anyone.

1:03:42.902 --> 1:03:45.029
[Frans] If it wasn't for forgiveness
and repentance,

1:03:45.112 --> 1:03:48.407
we wouldn't be here in South Africa,
because we would've killed each other.

1:03:51.744 --> 1:03:55.206
We went through a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission politically

1:03:55.289 --> 1:03:57.917
where people who murdered other people

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.503
based on their political beliefs
were acquitted.

1:04:00.586 --> 1:04:03.256
They were forgiven,
and they're serving in government.

1:04:03.339 --> 1:04:06.217
[gentle music playing]

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:10.179
And I think it-- 
it shows the nation we are.

1:04:13.474 --> 1:04:16.936
[voice breaks] We're a nation that
can stand together when it matters.

1:04:18.062 --> 1:04:20.189
And I certainly stood behind Hansie.

1:04:22.024 --> 1:04:22.900
Sorry.

1:04:23.484 --> 1:04:24.318
[sniffles]

1:04:46.757 --> 1:04:50.595
[closing theme music playing]
