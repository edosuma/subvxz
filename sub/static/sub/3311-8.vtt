WEBVTT

00:07.608 --> 00:10.478
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.180
( doorbell rings )

00:14.648 --> 00:15.649
( doorbell rings )

00:18.286 --> 00:19.520
DON'T GET UP.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.558
- YEAH?

00:24.592 --> 00:27.161
I'M MEL'S NEW LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT...
WELL, SORTA NEW.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.730
- I MEAN, I WAS AN INTERN FOREVER.
- YEAH, WE'VE MET.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.999
YOU'VE BEEN HERE,
LIKE EIGHT TIMES.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.502
- PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER ME.
- YEAH.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.571
HI, I'M STEPHANIE KRAUSE. I'M
MEL'S NEW LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.174
- SURE, I KNOW.
- STEPHANIE.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.144
- SO WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA?
- REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED THIS MORNING

00:43.177 --> 00:45.246
ABOUT GETTING YOU OUT
INTO THE COMMUNITY MORE?

00:45.279 --> 00:46.680
I GOT YOU SOME OPTIONS.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.582
- 5K RUN...
- NO.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.085
- ...10K RUN...
- NO TIMES TWO.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.754
- ...PANCAKE BREAKFAST...
- WARMER.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.756
- ...SINGLES' NIGHT DODGEBALL...
- WHAT?

00:55.789 --> 00:58.159
OOPS, SORRY, THAT'S MINE...

00:58.192 --> 01:01.162
AND COMPETING IN A
CHARITY DANCE CONTEST.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.030
- EH.
- WHAT'S "EH"?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.433
THAT SOUNDS GREAT. IF IT'S ABOUT
GETTING YOUR FACE OUT THERE,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.168
HOW WOULD YOU RATHER BE SEEN?
IN A SMOKING HOT DRESS

01:07.201 --> 01:08.602
OR WITH A MOUTHFUL OF PANCAKES?

01:08.636 --> 01:10.538
HONESTLY, ON A SKILL LEVEL,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.806
I'M BETTER AT THE
PANCAKE EATING.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.409
LET ME SEE THIS THING. COME
ON, THIS IS GONNA BE COOL.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.545
"DANCING WITH THE STARS...

01:17.578 --> 01:19.613
OF TOLEDO."

01:20.814 --> 01:22.750
CAN'T I JUST BE A
JUDGE OR SOMETHING?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.652
I'M REALLY GOOD AT
SNARKY COMMENTS.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.054
NICE SHIRT. HA! SEE?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.557
AUNT MEL, THE PRIZE MONEY GOES
TO THE CHARITY OF YOUR CHOICE.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.593
YOU COULD TOTALLY DO IT FOR THE
INNER-CITY AT-RISK TEENS I TUTOR.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.263
- OH, THAT'S SO NICE.
- I'M A GOOD PERSON.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.498
I MADE YOU DO THAT.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.067
YEAH, BUT I NO LONGER
RESENT YOU FOR IT.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.836
PLEASE, AUNT MEL. THIS MONEY COULD
BE LIFE-CHANGING FOR THESE KIDS.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.473
JUST FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, WHO
WOULD I BE DANCING WITH?

01:45.506 --> 01:48.376
SANITATION CHIEF
FRANKIE ZARNECKI,

01:48.409 --> 01:51.745
A.K.A., THE RUMBA
KING OF TOLEDO.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.148
YOU WANT ME TO DANCE
WITH FRANKIE ZARNECKI?

01:54.182 --> 01:56.384
HE'S GROPEY AND HE
SMELLS LIKE DOODY.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.587
SO... YES?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.555
HOW DID YOU GET "YES" FROM THAT?

02:01.589 --> 02:04.658
ISN'T THERE A SOME COCKTAIL FOR KIDS
WHERE I CAN THROW OUT THE FIRST OLIVE?

02:06.827 --> 02:09.263
PLEASE, DO NOT THROW
OUT THE DANCE CONTEST.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.865
- JUST GET ANOTHER PARTNER.
- LIKE WHO?

02:11.899 --> 02:14.368
ALL RIGHT, STOP BEGGING.
I'LL DO IT.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.537
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU A DANCER?

02:16.570 --> 02:19.139
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I HAD EXTENSIVE
DANCE TRAINING FOR MY WEDDING.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.543
OH? WHERE? AT THE
DANCE-TO-YOUR-DIVORCE ACADEMY

02:22.576 --> 02:25.613
OF THE DIVORCED?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.781
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,

02:27.815 --> 02:30.584
MY DANCE TEACHER TOLD ME THAT I WAS
THE BEST STUDENT SHE EVER HAD.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.454
- SAID I HAD THE GRACE OF A PANTHER...
- ( hisses )

02:35.489 --> 02:38.459
...AND THE PHYSIQUE
OF AN ACTION STAR.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.694
I CAN SEE THAT.

02:42.430 --> 02:45.799
SO THE DANCE TEACHER SELLING YOU
LESSONS SAID YOU WERE A NATURAL?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.301
UNHEARD OF.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.702
OKAY, MEL. YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.871
I REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.779
OH MY GOD! DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO SINGLES' NIGHT DODGEBALL?

02:58.812 --> 03:01.482
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, AUNT MEL?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.217
FINE.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.619
I'LL DO IT. BUT SOMEBODY'S
MAKING ME PANCAKES.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.727
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

03:18.632 --> 03:21.402
IT'S JUST THAT HISTORY HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.604
WHY DO I HAVE TO DO A
STUPID ORAL REPORT

03:23.637 --> 03:25.273
ON THINGS THAT
HAPPENED SO LONG AGO?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.840
AMERICAN HISTORY IS
IMPORTANT, DUDE.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.609
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS WORKING ON?
- THE 1980s.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.778
( chuckles ) THE 1980s.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.713
SERIOUSLY?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.848
THE 1980s? THAT'S HISTORY NOW?

03:34.882 --> 03:37.751
YEAH. HEY, YOU WERE
ALIVE WAY BACK THEN.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.653
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

03:39.687 --> 03:41.322
IT WAS BRUTAL, MAN, BRUTAL.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.756
WE SAT AROUND THE
FIRE IN OUR CAVES

03:42.790 --> 03:44.458
JUST WAITING FOR THE CELL
PHONE TO BE INVENTED.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.462
- HOW DID YOU TEXT PEOPLE?
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS CRAZY.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
BACK THEN WHEN WE HAD
MEANINGLESS INFORMATION,

03:50.464 --> 03:52.500
WE JUST KEPT IT TO OURSELVES.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.837
OKAY, I'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.740
HALF AN HOUR? DIDN'T
YOU GET THE SCHEDULE?

03:59.773 --> 04:01.975
I SAID WE NEED SIX TO SEVEN HOURS
A DAY MINIMUM FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.677
YEAH, 29 MINUTES.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.946
ALL RIGHT, FINE. WHATEVER.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.415
STAND UP.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.653
- STRAIGHTER.
- JEEZ.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.388
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA
PUT ONE HAND HERE

04:14.422 --> 04:15.689
AND THE OTHER HAND ON
MY OTHER SHOULDER.

04:15.723 --> 04:19.760
- YOU MEAN TOUCH YOU?
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.395
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOCK YOUR
THUMB UNDERNEATH MY ARMPIT.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.631
NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE WORLD.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.934
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE. IT'S CALLED
THE TANGO. WE NEED TO LOCK ELBOWS.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.937
I'M NOT LOCKING ANY OF MY
BODY PARTS WITH YOURS.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.772
COME ON, YOU CAN DO THIS.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.474
I KNOW I CAN. I
JUST DON'T WANT TO.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.843
ALL RIGHT. ONE HAND HERE

04:35.876 --> 04:38.979
- AND MY THUMB THERE.
- EXACTLY.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.649
AND THE MAN... THAT
WOULD BE ME...

04:41.682 --> 04:44.017
- I PUT MY HAND RIGHT HERE.
- ( laughs )

04:44.051 --> 04:45.719
- DON'T LAUGH.
- WELL, DON'T TICKLE ME.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.355
- I'M NOT TICKLING YOU.
- I'M TICKLISH THERE.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.922
YOU'RE TICKLISH ON
YOUR UPPER BACK?

04:48.956 --> 04:51.291
I'M TICKLISH IN A LOT OF PLACES
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.293
IT'S LIKE GIVING
AWAY LAUNCH CODES.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.828
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT TO
ACCIDENTALLY SET YOU OFF.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.365
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
PRESSURE AGAINST YOUR HAND

04:57.398 --> 04:58.666
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GO AGAINST THAT.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.267
THIS IS LIKE TWO MAGNETS...

05:00.300 --> 05:01.769
TWO MAGNETS THAT ARE BEING
REPELLED BY EACH OTHER.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.037
SO DANCING WITH YOU IS
BASED ON REPULSION.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.740
I AM GONNA BE AWESOME AT THIS.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.909
YOU'RE SO CUTE. REALLY.
YEAH. AWESOME.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.578
- OKAY, ARE YOU READY?
- MM-HMM.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.746
I'M GONNA MOVE AND
YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.955
- ( laughs )
- HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.924
GOOD. REALLY GOOD.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.326
I MEAN, IN A DANCING
SORT OF WAY.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.663
YOU SEE, THE TANGO IS
ALL ABOUT PASSION.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.299
THE MAN LEADS AND
THE WOMAN FOLLOWS

05:32.332 --> 05:33.934
UNTIL THEY BECOME...

05:35.569 --> 05:36.870
ONE.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.841
OKAY, I THINK I NEED A BREAK.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.511
HUH. ME TOO, YEAH.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.845
THAT WAS REALLY KIND OF...

05:44.878 --> 05:46.880
NO, I TOTALLY FEEL THE SAME WAY.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.618
THE PROBLEM HERE IS...
LET'S FACE IT...

05:50.651 --> 05:53.421
THAT WE HAVE THIS CHEMISTRY
THAT'S JUST SO...

05:53.454 --> 05:56.424
- FAKE.
- YEAH, I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.625
YEAH. NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.393
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
UP AGAINST HERE,

05:59.427 --> 06:02.663
- SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO SELL IT.
- YEAH. HEY.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.797
- OOH! I GOT IT! OKAY.
- MM-HMM?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.766
YOU KNOW THOSE
BROTHER/SISTER DANCE TEAMS?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.635
YEAH, CREEPY.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.703
MMM, SO CREEPY.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.940
BUT THEY DO THESE PASSIONATE
DANCES AND PEOPLE BUY IT.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.509
- WE COULD DO THAT.
- YEAH.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.978
YEAH, I COULD PRETEND TO
LIKE YOU, BROTHER JOE.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.949
AND I COULD PRETEND TO HAVE
PASSION FOR YOU, SISTER MEL.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.984
- ( beeps )
- ( tango music playing )

06:38.499 --> 06:40.968
- IT'S STILL A LITTLE CREEPY.
- YEAH, BUT I CAN DEAL WITH IT.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.877
OH! THANKS, STEPHANIE.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.446
I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SIGNED ON FOR.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.682
NO. THIS IS SO MUCH
BETTER THAN MY OLD JOB.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.952
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.555
CAN YOU MAKE THE 4:00 SIT-DOWN
WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY?

07:01.589 --> 07:04.024
OH, PUSH IT TO 6:00. JOE'S
GOT ME REHEARSING FOR HOURS.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.426
ALL THIS FOR A DINKY FUNDRAISER.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.629
OH, BY THE WAY, AMAZING NEWS...

07:08.662 --> 07:11.965
CHANNEL 8 CALLED. THEY'RE GOING TO
TELEVISE THE WHOLE THING... LIVE.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.803
- WHAT?! THAT'S TERRIBLE NEWS.
- WHAT IS TERRIBLE NEWS?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.438
OH, BROTHER JOE,
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.441
OUR DANCE CONTEST IS GOING TO
BE TELEVISED ON CHANNEL 8.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.077
- THAT'S GREAT.
- WHAT IF I TRIP?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.814
I'LL END UP THE LAUGHING STOCK
OF THE GREATER TOLEDO AREA.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.415
I'LL END UP A VIRAL VIDEO.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.817
SCHOOLCHILDREN IN MADRID
WILL BE MOCKING ME.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.787
"LA BAILARINA RIDICULOSO."
( mock laughs )

07:33.821 --> 07:35.989
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
- I NEED TO LOOK GREAT.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.793
AND YOU WILL... FOR
A STAR OF TOLEDO.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.463
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN
AS THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL

07:43.497 --> 07:45.799
- OF BALLROOM DANCE.
- THIS IS HOW YOU INSPIRE YOUR STUDENT?

07:45.833 --> 07:48.468
WOULD IT HURT TO BLOW A
LITTLE SMOKE MY WAY?

07:49.737 --> 07:52.840
YOU ARE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.780
- WAS THAT SO HARD?
- IT WASN'T EASY.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.826
LUNGE, FLICK, FLICK.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.528
LUNGE, FLICK, FLICK.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.564
OUT, UP,

08:16.597 --> 08:18.465
TURN AROUND,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.233
SPIN AND DROP.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.703
HOW LOW CAN I GO?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.139
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
- YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.176
THIS IS GONNA BE ON TV AND I
NEED TO SHOW ALL MY STRENGTHS.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.478
I'LL NEVER BE THE BEST
AT PRECISION TANGO,

08:31.511 --> 08:33.914
BUT I CAN BE THE BEST
AT PIZZAZZ TANGO.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.785
THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE DOING HERE.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.087
- JOE, I NEED TO LOOK GOOD.
- OH. ALL RIGHT.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.189
WELL, THEN YOU KNOW THE
PIZZAZZY THING YOU JUST DID?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.857
DON'T DO THAT.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.726
- BUT THAT'S ME.
- WELL, HIDE YOU,

08:45.759 --> 08:47.661
BECAUSE THE JUDGES, THEY DON'T
REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.763
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE IS THE
TANGO ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS

08:49.797 --> 08:51.632
OF THE WORLDWIDE
BALLROOM FEDERATION.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.500
OH WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO PISS OFF THOSE GUYS.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.202
THEY MIGHT SEND
ME TO DANCE JAIL.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.838
ONE OF US IS NOT REALLY
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.640
- OH, AND THAT'S ME?
- YEAH, THAT'S YOU.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.875
- NOW STAND UP. WE'RE GONNA DANCE.
- WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.811
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.145
- CONTROL.
- OH MY...

09:05.178 --> 09:07.547
YEAH, YOU LIVE IN MY
HOUSE, YOU WORK FOR ME...

09:07.581 --> 09:10.083
- TECHNICALLY I AM FREELANCE.
- EH-BEH-BEH.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.085
LOOK, YOU PUT UP WITH A LOT,

09:12.119 --> 09:13.787
AND THE ONE TIME YOU'RE
PUT IN A POSITION WHERE

09:13.821 --> 09:15.789
YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING, YOU
JUST WANT TO RUN THE WHOLE SHOW.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.659
OR MAYBE IT'S ABOUT SOMEONE WHO LIKES
TO CALL THE SHOTS AT EVERYTHING,

09:18.692 --> 09:21.228
INCLUDING THE EXACT COLOR OF
STRIPES IN OUR TOOTHPASTE.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.830
AND NOW YOU'RE INVOLVED IN
A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY

09:22.863 --> 09:24.197
ACTUALLY KNOWS A LITTLE
BIT MORE THAN YOU DO.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.166
HEY, STRIPES ARE
IMPORTANT, OKAY?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.235
THE GREEN FRESHENS AND
THE WHITE DAZZLES.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.875
- CONTROL FREAK!
- POWER-MAD DANCE MASTER!

09:34.908 --> 09:37.244
- WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THE DANCE, BABY.
- GOOD LUCK WITH THE EGO!

09:37.277 --> 09:39.179
- WHAT'S FOR DINNER?!
- FAJITAS!

09:39.212 --> 09:40.814
- I LOVE THOSE!
- ME TOO!

09:49.923 --> 09:52.760
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, JOE.
YOU JUST QUIT?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.762
YOU'RE NOT DANCING IN
THE FUNDRAISER ANYMORE?

09:54.795 --> 09:56.830
I DIDN'T QUIT. YOUR AUNT AND
I HAD ARTISTIC DIFFERENCES.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.800
I'M ARTISTIC AND...
AND SHE'S NUTS.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.237
OKAY. YEAH, YOU
KNEW THAT GOING IN.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.206
AND COME ON, WHAT ABOUT
THE AT-RISK KIDS?

10:06.239 --> 10:08.776
- THEY WERE COUNTING ON YOU GUYS.
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

10:08.809 --> 10:09.977
I'LL BUY THEM SOME
SCRATCH TICKETS

10:10.010 --> 10:11.945
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:13.847 --> 10:16.884
I DON'T KNOW. ACT LIKE
AN ADULT AND APOLOGIZE?

10:16.917 --> 10:19.186
- BE THE BIGGER PERSON?
- WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON?

10:19.219 --> 10:23.791
- WHY CAN'T SHE COME TALK TO ME?
- BECAUSE SHE'S BEING THE SMALLER PERSON.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.928
WHY CAN'T WE JUST BE THE
SAME SIZE FOR ONCE?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.364
COME ON. YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY
AND SHE'LL JUMP AT IT.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.366
AND YOU'LL HAVE SCORED MAJOR
POINTS FOR TAKING THE HIGH ROAD.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.737
ALL RIGHT, FINE. HIGH
ROAD, HERE I COME.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.839
- THANK YOU.
- ( sighs )

10:38.872 --> 10:40.874
OH, FINALLY SOME GOOD NEWS.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.342
OH, YOU REALLY CAME THROUGH
FOR ME, STEPHANIE.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.177
I LOVE WORKING FOR YOU.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.915
YOU ARE THE ONLY BOSS I'VE EVER HAD
WHERE YOU PAY ME AND THAT'S IT.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.853
- YES?
- I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.856
I JUST... I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT, UPON FURTHER THOUGHT,

10:55.889 --> 10:57.791
I MAY HAVE LET MY OWN
PERSONAL HIGH STANDARDS

10:57.825 --> 10:59.192
FOR DANCE GET IN THE WAY
OF OUR PARTNERSHIP.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.362
SO I'M HERE TO TELL
YOU THAT I APOL...

11:03.731 --> 11:05.766
I APOLOGIZE.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.701
AND I'VE DECIDED I'M
WILLING TO COME BACK

11:07.735 --> 11:09.903
AND BE YOUR DANCE PARTNER AGAIN.

11:09.937 --> 11:13.741
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR APOL...
OGIZING.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.177
AND I MAY HAVE GONE
A LITTLE FAR TOO.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.748
SO THE BROTHER/SISTER
TEAM IS BACK ON THE ROAD?

11:20.781 --> 11:23.917
- UH, NO.
- THE SISTER IS.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.353
- YEAH, SEE, WHEN YOU QUIT...
- WAIT, I DID NOT QUIT.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.957
- WELL, WHEN WE PARTED WAYS...
- NUH-UH, I JUST NEEDED A BREAK.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.792
SHE GOT A NEW DANCE PARTNER.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.194
WHAT? IT... IT'S
BEEN THREE HOURS.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.830
YEAH, WELL, STEPHANIE MADE SOME
CALLS AND SHE GOT REALLY LUCKY.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.866
SHE GOT THAT MARK BALLAS GUY...

11:38.899 --> 11:40.901
YOU KNOW THAT CUTE GUY FROM THE
REAL "DANCING WITH THE STARS"?

11:40.934 --> 11:43.170
WELL, IT TURNS OUT HE'S IN
DETROIT DOING A LIVE SHOW

11:43.203 --> 11:45.839
AND HE CAN COME OVER ON SATURDAY AND
DANCE WITH ME AT THE FUNDRAISER.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.441
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PROMISE
TO NAME A STREET AFTER HIM.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.911
AND THERE'S ALREADY
A BALLAS BOULEVARD.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.480
- SHH.
- SHH.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.417
OH, I SEE. MARK BALLAS.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.719
YEAH.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.255
DID... DID HE WIN LAST YEAR?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.157
I DON'T THINK HE DID.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.999
OW! OOH, YOU STABBED ME IN THE
BACK WITH YOUR FINGERNAILS.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.267
OH. NOW YOU KNOW
HOW JOE FEELS...

12:14.301 --> 12:16.003
TO BE STABBED IN THE BACK...

12:16.036 --> 12:18.171
BY A PERSON HE TRUSTED.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.974
OKAY, LOOK, I FEEL BAD FOR JOE,

12:21.008 --> 12:22.843
BUT WE GOT MARK BALLAS.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.278
WE DON'T HAVE MARK BALLAS!

12:25.312 --> 12:27.747
- YET.
- KEEP TALKING. KEEP GLITTERING.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.017
KEEP CALM. MARK BALLAS
IS CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC

12:30.050 --> 12:33.020
AND IS SOMEWHAT DELAYED. AND BY
"SOMEWHAT," I MEAN A FLAT TIRE.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.888
SWEATING.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.190
HE SWEARS HE'LL BE HERE IN
TIME FOR THE COMPETITION.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.826
WHAT IF HE'S NOT? SCHVITZING.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.227
HE WILL BE HERE.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.762
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF HE'S NOT AND STUFF?
DRENCHED.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.064
AUNT MEL, I THINK
THESE ARE YOURS.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.499
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LEFT MY
SHOW BOOBS IN THE CAR.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.901
THANKS, RYDER.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.972
DON'T WORRY. EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.275
IF BALLAS DOESN'T SHOW, WE'VE
GOT THE RUMBA KING STANDING BY.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.282
OKAY, HE DEFINITELY DIDN'T
LEAVE HIS BOOBS IN THE CAR.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.194
WHERE IS BALLAS? YOU
SAID HE'D BE HERE!

13:14.227 --> 13:16.096
I LOOK AROUND AND
I DON'T SEE HIM!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.866
PLEASE STOP WORRYING.
YOU'RE MOLTING.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.069
WOW, LOOK AT YOU...

13:22.102 --> 13:24.838
A DRESS MADE OUT OF
A FLOCK OF PARROTS.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.875
JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THERE'S
A NICE CROWD OUT THERE TONIGHT,

13:27.908 --> 13:29.809
SO JUST RELAX

13:29.843 --> 13:33.813
- AND HAVE A GOOD TIME, OKAY?
- LOOK, JOE,

13:33.847 --> 13:35.382
YOU'RE A REALLY GREAT DANCER.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.816
YOU REALLY DO KNOW THE TANGO

13:36.850 --> 13:38.785
AND I REALLY DO NEED SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS THE TANGO,

13:38.818 --> 13:41.488
BECAUSE I...

13:41.521 --> 13:43.023
I... I SEE MARK BALLAS!

13:43.056 --> 13:45.192
OH, MARK, YOU MADE IT!

13:45.225 --> 13:47.861
- I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
- ME TOO.

13:47.895 --> 13:52.099
SO SHOULD WE... YOU KNOW, A QUICK
REHEARSAL? GET OUR TANGO ON?

13:52.132 --> 13:54.534
TANGO? I THOUGHT WE
WERE DOING THE WALTZ.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.404
OH, I'M JUST KIDDING.
TANGO IT IS.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.540
( laughs ) I LOVE
BALLROOM HUMOR.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.843
LOOK, JOE. JOE, I'M REALLY SORRY

14:03.877 --> 14:05.578
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
US AND ME BRINGING MARK IN.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.147
LOOK, IT'S FINE. NO WORRIES.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.549
YOU TRADED UP. I WOULD
HAVE DONE THE SAME THING

14:09.582 --> 14:12.986
IF I WAS, YOU KNOW, YOU.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.589
COME ON, EVERYBODY,
PICTURE TIME.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.592
LOOK GOOD. EASY FOR
YOU, MARK BALLAS.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.932
- GREAT, GET THAT SHOT.
- WAIT WAIT, I CAN DO BETTER.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.200
WATCH.

14:28.601 --> 14:32.039
OH MY GOD! SAVE MARK BALLAS!
SAVE MARK BALLAS!

14:32.072 --> 14:34.007
Mark: IT'S THE KNEE.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.943
WOW, JOE, IF MARK'S KNEE'S SHOT,

14:35.976 --> 14:37.144
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DANCE WITH MEL.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.979
WAIT WAIT, IT'S NOT MY KNEE.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.849
- MEL, IS IT BAD?
- OH, I'M FINE.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.585
NEVER BEEN BETTER. OH!
OH, I COULD BE BETTER!

14:45.618 --> 14:47.854
- OH, I COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER!
- COME HERE. SIT DOWN.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.390
SIT DOWN. LET ME LOOK AT THIS. OH,
THAT KNEE'S STARTING TO SWELL UP.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.226
- OH!
- DOES THIS MEAN YOU CAN'T DANCE?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.595
OH HELL NO, I'M GONNA DANCE.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.231
YEAH, DANCE THROUGH THE
PAIN FOR THE KIDS.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.233
RIGHT, LENNOX? OH!

15:00.267 --> 15:02.335
I DON'T KNOW, AUNT MEL.
THAT DOES LOOK PRETTY BAD.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.870
HANG ON A SECOND.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.939
IF I DON'T DANCE, I STILL GET...

15:05.973 --> 15:08.875
I STILL GET BALLAS
BOULEVARD, RIGHT?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.511
OH. OH, YOU'RE GOING TO
DANCE TONIGHT, MARK.

15:11.544 --> 15:15.148
THE CAUSE WILL GO ON JUST
WITH ONE LITTLE SUBSTITUTION.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.250
- STEPHANIE?
- OH MY GOD.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.086
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD!

15:19.119 --> 15:20.553
GO TELL THE ANNOUNCER

15:20.587 --> 15:22.655
THAT MARK IS GOING
TO DANCE WITH JOE.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.229
WAIT... WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.630
YOU KNOW THE STEPS, DON'T YOU?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.932
KNOW THE STEPS? I MEAN...

15:32.966 --> 15:34.968
I LIVE THE STEPS.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.405
LOOK, JOE, I AM GENUINELY
SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID, OKAY?

15:38.438 --> 15:41.108
YOU WERE RIGHT. I
AM A CONTROL FREAK.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.610
I WAS CLEARLY BOTHERED
BY WHAT YOU SAID,

15:43.643 --> 15:45.945
THAT YOU KNOW SO
MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS

15:45.979 --> 15:48.348
- AND I WAS SO LOST.
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT, MEL.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.518
THEN DO THIS FOR ME. PLEASE.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.227
FINE. I'LL DO IT.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.064
BUT ONLY IF I CAN LEAD.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.535
OKAY.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.705
AND NOW DANCING FOR THE ST. ELIGIUS

16:12.739 --> 16:15.542

WHOO.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.755
JOE LONGO.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.963
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A
DEEPLY TRAGIC MISTAKE.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.232
SHUT UP.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.439
( tango music playing )

17:39.692 --> 17:42.162
THIS IS WHY I DON'T
WATCH SHOWTIME.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.072
MARK BALLAS AND JOE LONGO!

17:53.106 --> 17:56.176
SO IF THE JUDGES HAVE REGAINED
THEIR COLLECTIVE COMPOSURE,

17:56.209 --> 17:57.744
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.780
THAT'S A NINE! AND A NINE.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.616
AND A NINE... HUNDRED AND TEN!

18:03.650 --> 18:06.819
THAT'S THE HIGHEST SCORE
IN THE HISTORY OF DANCE!

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
THAT'S MY NANNY!

18:14.461 --> 18:17.397
OH! OH! HOSPITAL! HOSPITAL.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.533
COME ON, TAKE IT EASY NOW.
WE'RE HOME!

18:20.567 --> 18:23.570
- ARE THE PAIN MEDS KICKING IN YET?
- NO.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.606
WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET HOME?

18:26.639 --> 18:30.210
OH, WHAT A NIGHT.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.713
JOE! JOE, YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN THERE.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.649
I KNOW. YEAH YEAH.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.619
THEY GAVE YOUR AUNT SOME
SERIOUS PAIN MEDICATIONS.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.355
- GOT IT.
- LENNOX.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.658
LENNOX, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.
JOE SAVED THE DAY.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.094
- OH.
- YEAH AND, RYDER... WHERE'S RYDER?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.730
RYDER! RYDER!

18:50.763 --> 18:52.665
AHEM. RIGHT HERE...
IN FRONT OF YOU.

18:52.699 --> 18:56.436
OH, I'VE MISSED YOU
SO MUCH, CHILD.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.839
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.676
WHY IS SHE TALKING LIKE
AN OLD SOUTHERN WOMAN?

19:03.710 --> 19:05.645
IT'S THE PAIN MEDS.
LOOK AT THAT:

19:05.678 --> 19:07.680
"SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
NAUSEA, DIZZINESS,

19:07.714 --> 19:09.816
AND SOUNDING LIKE
REBA McENTIRE."

19:11.484 --> 19:13.886
( groans ) OH, I SO
WANTED TO DANCE TONIGHT.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.789
IT'S OKAY, AUNT MEL.
YOU'LL GET 'EM NEXT TIME.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.226
OH, BUT I WANTED TO
DANCE FOR YOU, LENNOX,

19:19.259 --> 19:21.861
AND THE KID-ZZZZZZZZZ.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.196
I GOT IT!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.567
YEAH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.803
OH, YOU'RE A DEAR,

19:30.837 --> 19:34.474
SWEET GIRL. YES, YOU ARE.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.309
- YES, YOU ARE.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.378
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEL? WE'RE
GONNA GO UPSTAIRS NOW.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.846
- OKAY? COME ON. UPSTAIRS.
- OKAY.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.215
- HERE WE GO.
- OH, JOE, JOE!

19:42.249 --> 19:43.283
- YEAH?
- JOE!

19:43.316 --> 19:44.884
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.719
LET'S SHOW THESE KIDS WHAT
DANCING'S REALLY ABOUT.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.154
- NO NO NO NO NO.
- RIGHT NOW.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.422
- YEAH.
- MEL, MEL, MEL.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.291
NO WAY, NOT ON THAT KNEE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.626
JOE, WHERE WE'RE GOING,
WE DON'T NEED KNEES.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.687
( both giggle )

20:25.258 --> 20:27.794
SHE'S LOST HER MIND.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.762
SHE LOOKS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.467
I KNOW.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.503
AND SOON

20:36.536 --> 20:38.838
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL KNOW TOO.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.774
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LOOK,
YOU GET YOUR AUNT.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.743
I'M GOING TO GRAB SOME
PILLOWS AND SHEETS.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.945
SHE'S GONNA SLEEP ON THE COUCH TONIGHT.
LET'S GO, CHOP CHOP.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.914
AUNT MEL, LET'S GIVE
YOUR PARTNER A REST.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.251
WERE YOU DREAMING ABOUT
DANCING WITH MARK BALLAS?

20:52.285 --> 20:55.988
OH, YEAH YEAH, MARK BALLAS.
YEAH, THAT'S WHO.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.528
OH, SLEEPY.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.939
OH HEY, MEL,

21:12.972 --> 21:15.274
LENNOX IS IN THERE TUTORING THOSE
INNER-CITY AT-RISK KIDS...

21:15.308 --> 21:16.643
THE ONES THAT WE WON
THE PRIZE MONEY FOR.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.678
REALLY? OH, I'D
LOVE TO SAY HELLO.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.280
SURE.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.751
HEY, GUYS.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.358
THESE KIDS ARE AT RISK OF
WHAT, BECOMING MODELS?

21:31.391 --> 21:33.793
MEL, ISN'T IT GREAT THE WAY
THAT LENNOX JUST LOVES

21:33.826 --> 21:36.028
TO SELFLESSLY GIVE
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY?

21:36.062 --> 21:38.798
SORRY, WE TOTALLY TOOK
OVER THE KITCHEN.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.668
- WE CAN JUST MOVE THIS UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM...
- NO NO NO!

21:41.701 --> 21:43.870
YOU SIT. YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.
YOU DON'T MOVE.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.972
OKAY? WE DON'T WANT
YOU AT RISK TOO.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.007
DON'T LET THEM OUT
OF YOUR SIGHT.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.480
DON'T MIND ME, FELLAS. I'VE JUST
GOT A LITTLE WORK TO DO OVER HERE.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.782
I TELL YOU, ONE OF THE
BEST THINGS I EVER DID

21:55.815 --> 21:57.950
WAS GO TO CULINARY SCHOOL
WHILE I WAS IN PRISON.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.627
( theme music playing )
