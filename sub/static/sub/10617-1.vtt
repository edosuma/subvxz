01:17.343 --> 01:21.609
When I first met Clarice in college,
I was completely sprung.

01:24.217 --> 01:28.244
She was smart, passionate, driven.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.423
The sweetest thing I'd ever met.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.657
You know the kind of woman
I'm talking about, right?

01:33.860 --> 01:35.555
The got-your-back kind of woman?

01:36.663 --> 01:39.063
I did what a good man does
when he finds the woman...

01:39.265 --> 01:41.199
...he's been dreaming about
his whole life.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.891
I went all the way.

01:43.103 --> 01:48.564
For if one falls down,
the other is there to pick him up.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.799
That's right.

01:50.009 --> 01:54.469
Even better
is a cord of three strands...

01:55.248 --> 01:58.115
...because it is not easily broken.

01:59.719 --> 02:06.090
My brother, my sister,
life is going to try to knock you down.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.384
Amen.

02:07.594 --> 02:11.086
And it's hard to keep
the good in a good marriage...

02:11.297 --> 02:12.764
...when bad things happen.

02:13.633 --> 02:19.196
The two of you represents
the first two strands.

02:21.007 --> 02:24.408
But God represents the third.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.581
And as long as you stay
close to him...

02:28.781 --> 02:31.614
...your marriage
will be a three-stranded cord...

02:31.818 --> 02:34.616
...this world can never break.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.631
-l love you.
-l love you.

02:56.109 --> 03:00.102
Congregation,
Mr. and Mrs. David Johnson.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.545
On our wedding night...

03:06.753 --> 03:09.916
...it was just the two of us
in a little slice of heaven.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.688
We didn't come up for air
for two days.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.367
Together,
we had goals and dreams.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.841
We were going places in this world.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.439
She was gonna be
a real-estate rainmaker.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.617
I was gonna be
a major-league ball player...

03:38.818 --> 03:41.912
...with hall-of-fame numbers,
a big contract...

03:42.121 --> 03:45.284
...an entrepreneur, daddy.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.550
The big life.

03:48.294 --> 03:51.491
Till it all ended shattering my leg
sliding into home plate...

03:51.698 --> 03:55.759
...during the final game
of my rookie season.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.941
Yeah, that's how young love
always starts out.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.753
Feels like the honeymoon
will last forever.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.254
But like the bishop said...

04:24.464 --> 04:27.228
...life has a way
of knocking the hell out of you.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.702
-Oh, hey, baby, sorry l'm late.
-Hey, baby.

04:30.903 --> 04:33.371
There was this bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the 5.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.972
-lt's okay.
-But look at you.

04:35.174 --> 04:39.406
Look at you in my little favorite,
sexy, big, grown-girl outfit.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.072
Oh, no, baby,
l just touched my face up.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.806
Can't go there.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.450
All right.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.183
-This is it.
-What's that?

04:48.388 --> 04:50.379
This new property
l've been dying to show.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.455
l think l'm gonna get
an offer on it soon.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.217
-When are you showing it?
-Tonight.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.917
-Oh, baby, not tonight.
-Why?

04:56.329 --> 04:59.696
You know, l thought we could get
a little quality time, you know?

04:59.899 --> 05:02.197
Oh, God, Dave,
l would love to spend quality time.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.235
But, you know,
my commissions pay for this house.

05:05.438 --> 05:08.339
And besides, these clients could pay
for that new work truck...

05:08.541 --> 05:10.338
...we've been dying to get you.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.103
You think l want
my big, strong, chocolate kiss...

05:13.313 --> 05:15.508
...driving around
in that beat-up old thing?

05:16.282 --> 05:19.410
David, you're building
a business, okay?

05:19.619 --> 05:20.984
And appearance is everything.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.916
lt's about time we put the pro back...

05:23.122 --> 05:25.147
...in Dave's All Pro
Building and Remodeling.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.451
Appearance is everything,
that's what you said?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.958
l'm saying, you can't show up
to someone's house...

05:30.163 --> 05:32.597
...talking about you're here
to remodel and rebuild...

05:32.799 --> 05:34.494
...in that beat-up old rusty truck.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.295
-l happen to like that truck with rust.
-lt's a bucket.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.666
-The rust, everything, l like that truck.
-Okay, okay, okay.

05:40.873 --> 05:45.207
What about this weekend,
you and l close ourselves in...

05:45.411 --> 05:48.574
...and try out that new Jacuzzi tub
we bought?

05:48.915 --> 05:50.576
l like that idea.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.876
-But it has to be after Saturday.
-Why?

05:53.086 --> 05:54.951
l'm meeting the boys
and team on Saturday.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.451
-The boys?
-But....

05:56.656 --> 06:00.456
But after that-- After that, it can then
be just you and me, and me and you.

06:00.660 --> 06:04.562
And then we could talk
about little miniature you and mes.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.493
Oh, God, please.
Don't press your luck.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.999
And there goes our quality time,
so that's on you, brother.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.732
-Are you gonna hoop later?
-Yeah, meet Brock and Tree about 7.

06:14.941 --> 06:18.809
Good, good, you know, because l feel
a little extra around the middle section.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.706
-You ain't feeling--
-Yes, l do, baby.

06:20.913 --> 06:24.815
l'm feeling a little spare tire.
Get your hoops on tonight.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.507
-For-- For real, you feel--
-Yeah.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.483
-You don't-- You--
-l'll see you later, okay?

06:55.348 --> 06:56.337
Good morning.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.278
You've been holding out on me,
Clarice.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.681
-What?
-You didn't tell me you was...

07:02.088 --> 07:04.556
...taking Oprah and Stedman
out to look at houses.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.624
Oh, hush, girl,
that's Mr. and Mrs. Reid.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.694
He's a federal judge
and she's a chichi art dealer.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.092
They're looking to get
into a new zip code.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.494
Well, you are already
Salesperson of the Year.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.726
How come you can't throw
your girl charity...

07:17.937 --> 07:20.064
...and help me meet
my quota for the month?

07:20.273 --> 07:23.970
Because, sister girl, that's not how
l got to be Salesperson of the Year.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.042
When you live the life,
you pay the price.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.236
And these bills
are about to strangle me.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.313
What about Dave?

07:30.516 --> 07:32.541
Go make that money, girl.

07:32.752 --> 07:35.243
Sorry l asked.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.754
Hey, Eminem, Eminem,
you wanna turn that down a little bit?

07:39.959 --> 07:40.948
Sorry, man.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.355
Give my neighbors a heart attack.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.297
You guys think l'm getting fat?

07:45.498 --> 07:47.261
-You what?
-What did you say?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.765
Yeah, Reesie says
it looks like l'm gaining weight.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.459
lf she's says it's your ass, yes.

07:51.671 --> 07:52.968
Yes, your ass did get bigger.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.696
Not looking at my ass, are you?

07:54.907 --> 07:57.671
lf l am looking at your ass right now,
l got good reason to.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.539
Since Vanessa got pregnant,
she won't let me see her naked.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.611
So ass is an ass right now.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.283
l can't wait to play ball today.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.248
l'm giving everybody a good play.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.115
Speaking of big asses,
how did that disposition thing go...

08:10.323 --> 08:11.688
...with your divorce attorney?

08:11.891 --> 08:14.451
-You mean, deposition, Tree?
-Depo-- That's what l said.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.957
-Yeah, right.
-What did l say?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.131
-You said disposition.
-All right, l'm sorry, human thesaurus.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.926
-How did your deposition go?
-Oh, man, it's ridiculous.

08:22.134 --> 08:23.328
l'm a dead man.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.869
Fiona's gonna try to take everything.
My house, this car, half my salary.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.472
That is ridiculous, man.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.040
What, she gonna let you keep
the big screen, though?

08:31.244 --> 08:33.712
Please tell me
she not gonna take your big screen.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.312
-Oh, damn.
-That--

08:35.780 --> 08:37.270
Can we talk about something else?

08:37.482 --> 08:39.951
-You know, l will leave that alone.
-Thank you.

08:40.152 --> 08:43.349
You over here worried
about your weight, he's losing a TV.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.386
-All right, all right. Come on. Let's go.
-Come on, y'all.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.369
Damn.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.197
Keep away from him, keep away.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.076
Putting it up.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.754
-Oh, no.
-Shake it off, babe.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.017
Don't bring that here.
Don't bring that here.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.353
What was that?

09:27.366 --> 09:29.357
-Get off me.
-What was that, man?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.367
Chill, yo.
Darnell, what's wrong with--?

09:33.105 --> 09:35.630
Bringing in here street ball.
You brought it in here.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.536
-That's what's wrong.
-Check yourself.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.438
You ain't in the prison yard no more.

09:39.645 --> 09:40.634
-What?
-You heard me.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.677
You don't know
what you're talking about.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.975
You don't know
what you're talking about.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.880
-Ball up top, ball up top.
-Yeah, ball up top.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.180
-l got my integrity, boy.
-Don't drop the soap.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.983
You ain't nothing like you used to be.
l see how you are.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.990
-Whatever. You-- l'm from the 'hood.
-You not from the 'hood.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.425
-You ain't from the 'hood?
-l know where l'm from.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.496
-You're acting like you're not.
-Whatever.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.168
-You Starbucks soldier.
-Don't drop the soap.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.393
Starbucks security.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.970
Get out of here with this bull--

10:07.173 --> 10:09.141
Hey, watch out, Dave.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.841
Oh, that's it, huh?
Game's over, huh?

10:14.046 --> 10:16.310
What are you...?
Aren't you with him?

10:16.515 --> 10:17.641
Why are you still here?

10:17.850 --> 10:19.283
You're not on our side.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.016
Big, just bully for no reason.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.284
He's starting to shoot.
He's shooting.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.054
Look at that view.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.694
Big garage there,
lt's beautiful, solar-lit.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.420
Now, isn't this beautiful?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.156
Look at this open space.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.734
And what l love about this house
for you, Judge Reid...

10:37.937 --> 10:41.464
...are the floor-to-ceiling built-ins
in the study for all of your law books.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.643
And for you, Mrs. Reid,
the east-facing front door.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.277
So feng shui.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.544
Feng what?

10:48.748 --> 10:50.841
lt's Chinese, baby.
lt means harmony.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.714
l assume the sellers
are looking for full price.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.287
Well, we can ask, but l doubt
they will be willing to come down.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.423
But there aren't many homes
in this neighborhood...

11:01.627 --> 11:04.687
...with a garage big enough
for your vintage-car collection.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.489
How did you know
about my Corvettes?

11:06.699 --> 11:10.499
Oh, l make it my business to know
the unique needs of all of my clients.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.399
l think l'd like to see
how my chi flows...

11:14.607 --> 11:17.872
-...through the master bedroom.
-Sure. l'll leave this with the judge.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.806
Wait until you see
the bedroom balcony.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.070
The view is spectacular.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.373
Funk shwa.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.643
Don't know why Darnell
needs to hate like that.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.412
Come on, man. l kind of thought
we'd been over this, D.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.988
Yeah, it was 1 5 years ago.
He needs to get over it.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.421
-Got three more.
-You gotta look at it like this.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.256
-He feel he got dealt a bad hand.
-Nobody forced him to sling that crack.

11:38.464 --> 11:41.661
Well, he just needs to realize
that life isn't always fair, man.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.095
Believe me, l know.

11:43.502 --> 11:46.164
Come on, now, just what part...

11:46.372 --> 11:48.863
...of your magnificent life
are you whining about now?

11:49.075 --> 11:50.508
What are you talking about, man?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.644
l'm getting screwed
by the divorce lawyers.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.676
Well, B, you act
like you don't know why.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.745
You getting screwed
because you a hound.

11:56.949 --> 12:00.009
-l'm not a hound.
-You get more tail than a public toilet.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.187
True, but with Fiona,
l was always faithful.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.549
l mean, l may have browsed,
but l never bought.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.486
-You never bought?
-l never bought.

12:06.692 --> 12:07.681
-Never bought?
-Never.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.918
What about the Thai massages
you like to get?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.188
All right, so what?
l bought once or twice.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.223
See, that's your problem, man.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.401
Me, personally, l don't browse,
l don't buy.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.866
l keep my eyes straight ahead.
l'm focused.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.699
l don't see nothing else.
l even turned in my player card.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.068
Yeah, man, l feel you.
Clarice has radar.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.703
She can even see my eyes moving
behind my sunglasses.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.346
You wanna know what l do,
though?

12:29.548 --> 12:31.482
When l wake up,
l just tell Vanessa sorry.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.914
l don't care if l did anything.
l tell her sorry.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.054
l tell her sorry
about 1 0 times a day. Why?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.416
Because if l do something,
l already apologized.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.455
She has nothing to say.
Makes her happy.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.889
And a happy wife equals what?
A happy husband.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.461
That isn't living.
That's just breathing.

12:45.664 --> 12:47.154
Hey, l tell you what.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.961
l'm not the one losing my big screen.
And why is the chair so low?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.035
Put it so l can use the machine, Brock.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.231
-Julie, Julie. That's my girl.
-Who's that?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.740
-My girl, Julie.
-Dave.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.913
And the guy at the front desk
says she's single.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.103
So am l.

13:03.315 --> 13:04.577
Well, almost.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.242
Tell me why you walked over here.
What are you even looking at?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.580
This is not our ballpark.

13:09.989 --> 13:13.356
We're focusing, Brock.
Eyes on the prize.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.527
l got my eyes on the prize.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.693
Hey, looking good. Keep going.

13:22.601 --> 13:25.161
Keep pushing, Bryson. Don't quit.

13:25.604 --> 13:26.628
Keep pushing, buddy.

13:26.839 --> 13:28.204
Last half lap.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.364
Push to the end, Bryson.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.044
Finish strong, buddy. Kick it.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.769
Good. Good job, buddy.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.846
Great heat, baby.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.810
How did that feel, Bryson?

13:41.020 --> 13:42.317
Good, l guess.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.318
Feel that good?

13:45.257 --> 13:46.849
New record.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.857
Remember to count your strokes so
you know when you're near the wall.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.496
You see that scar?

13:52.698 --> 13:53.858
No accidents.

13:54.066 --> 13:56.534
-Sorry, coach, l forgot that time.
-All right.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.568
Now, with the regional finals
coming up, what would you say...

13:59.772 --> 14:02.206
...if l included your freestyle
in the 400 medley?

14:02.708 --> 14:05.336
lt's the 1 4-year-olds,
but l want you to start steering...

14:05.544 --> 14:07.944
...toward the Junior Olympics
for next year.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.408
l'll take that as a yes.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.277
-We're gonna get some pizza.
-l'm so excited.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.318
-Mom, stop, it's embarrassing.
-Why? l'm excited.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.685
You just cleaned the clocks
of a bunch of high school freshmen.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.058
Baby, you awake?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.330
l am now.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.232
Are you drunk?

14:33.439 --> 14:35.270
No, l'm not drunk.

14:35.841 --> 14:39.004
-Just had a beer with the fellas.
-That's nice.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.111
-You know what l was thinking?
-What?

14:42.314 --> 14:48.344
l was thinking that we need to get back
to the loving part of our marriage.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.152
l know what this is about.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.256
Trying to keep up
with Tree and Vanessa.

14:52.458 --> 14:56.292
-No, l ain't trying to keep up--
-Yes, you are, yes, you are.

14:56.495 --> 15:01.899
l just look at you, and l just think that
we could have some beautiful babies.

15:02.334 --> 15:07.203
David, how many times
do we have to have this discussion?

15:07.406 --> 15:08.737
l'm not ready for babies.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.000
Would you move over?
lt's hot in here.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.700
l'm not ready for babies.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.779
l have a career, l have dreams,
l have places l wanna go.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.279
-l do too.
-A baby's just gonna get in the way.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.510
Besides, you're building a business,
okay?

15:21.720 --> 15:24.621
You can't come home
all hours of the night...

15:24.823 --> 15:28.259
...after drinking with your boys,
and then expect to have sex...

15:28.460 --> 15:31.452
...like rabbits all night long.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.992
Oh, by the way,
l need you home by 5:00 tomorrow...

15:36.201 --> 15:37.361
...for my awards ceremony.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.900
Yeah.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.699
Whatever.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.976
Like that rag on your head.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.673
That's why you're not getting any.

15:49.648 --> 15:50.637
There we go, get it.

15:50.849 --> 15:52.749
Keep your butt down.
Keep your butt down.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.386
See the ball into the glove.
You'll get it, Marcus.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.179
All right, here we go.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.024
Get in there.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.693
-There you go.
-Good play, that's what l like to see.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.159
-That's what l like to see.
-Yeah, boy, yeah, boy.

16:05.364 --> 16:07.389
Who's your daddy now, sucker?

16:07.599 --> 16:08.827
Please, cracker.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.468
You looking like your white mama
making that play.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.535
-What?
-Hey, not today.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.728
Hey.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.407
Hey.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.041
-Just let go.
-Go, fight, fight, fight.

16:19.244 --> 16:20.268
Get-- Hey, hey.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.468
-What--?
-Come on, man.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.375
-Get your hands--
-Break it up.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.812
-Boy, you better get up.
-Bring it in.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.849
-Get up.
-Bring it in.

16:30.055 --> 16:33.286
Des, what's wrong with you, huh?
How many times do l have to tell you?

16:33.492 --> 16:36.984
Nobody is gonna disrespect
anybody on this team.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.390
You got that?

16:39.398 --> 16:40.729
Now, both of you look at me.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.458
What race am l?

16:42.668 --> 16:43.965
Black.

16:44.403 --> 16:45.700
Wrong.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.769
You know what Brother King said?

16:47.973 --> 16:51.500
He said l'm human first,
then l'm black.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.640
There's only one race of people,
and that's the human race.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.248
But there's two kinds of people,
the good ones and bad ones.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.207
Now, Darius, look at Coach Brock.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.920
What race is he?

17:04.455 --> 17:05.923
White.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.287
We're gonna have to work on that.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.861
Hit the bases. Let's go.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.499
What are you saying, man?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.167
Martin Luther King
never said those words.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.494
No, that was Tyrone King.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.366
You know, he owns that barber shop
down there on Florence.

17:21.573 --> 17:22.835
You're lying. l know Tyrone.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.306
He stutter.
He don't even talk like that.

17:25.511 --> 17:28.138
Look, look, we got company, dude.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.113
Come on.

17:32.851 --> 17:35.081
You gotta get up out of here
with that King Cobra.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.847
l ain't got to get up
out of nowhere, man.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.389
l can come see my boy
anywhere l want to.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.617
Not drunk on your ass, you can't.

17:42.828 --> 17:45.353
lt's a bad influence on the boys
and against league rules.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.929
Get out of here, man, come on.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.100
Oh, what, you gonna go
get the police on me?

17:49.301 --> 17:51.826
Because of the rules,
you gonna go get the police on me?

17:52.037 --> 17:54.096
All right,
l ain't gonna cause no trouble.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.967
Darius, let's go.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.403
Coach said we gotta go.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.133
l ain't finished playing yet.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.333
What?

18:00.546 --> 18:03.743
Man, get your ass over here right now.
l said it's time to go.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.145
-God.
-l'll drag your ass out of here.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.081
Get over here now.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.053
Who you talking to like that?

18:13.692 --> 18:16.092
Better not ever talk to me
like that, boy.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.929
No wonder Darius has an attitude.

18:20.132 --> 18:22.259
With him as his father.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.197
Well, see, he's his daddy.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.337
He's a long way
from being his father, man.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.904
Let's go. Here we go.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.669
Why you gotta make me
quit the team?

18:33.879 --> 18:37.542
You better watch how you talk to me,
boy, before l put my foot in your ass.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.378
But l wanna play ball like you did.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.646
Oh, now you're saying
you wanna be like me?

18:44.523 --> 18:47.151
You really wanna be like me,
then buck up.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.417
Do you see me out there?

18:48.627 --> 18:52.393
l ain't chasing after no empty dreams
in no field wasting my damn time.

18:52.598 --> 18:55.362
l'm in the real world.
You wanna come to the real world?

18:55.567 --> 18:58.764
Because the real world eats your ass
and spits your ass out.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.032
Wake up.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.335
Stop dreaming.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.194
Did you really forget
about my awards ceremony?

19:29.401 --> 19:32.268
l know, l just got carried away
with the boys, baby, all right?

19:32.471 --> 19:35.998
-Give me five minutes. Five minutes.
-You are so insensitive and selfish.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.644
Everything is about you
and those damn boys.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.980
Do you have any idea
how important this night is for me?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.049
How hard l've worked for us?

19:47.252 --> 19:50.346
Or what an honor it is
to be Salesperson of the Year?

19:50.556 --> 19:52.615
Look, l know it's a big night
for you, okay?

19:52.824 --> 19:55.884
l'm sorry. l got a little caught up
on the field, l apologize.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.062
Why do you waste your time
with those boys?

19:58.263 --> 20:00.823
Clarice, don't start. Don't start.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.695
You know how important it is for me
to be coaching kids.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.302
They're not gonna do nothing
but end up in prison...

20:06.505 --> 20:08.439
...like their ghetto-pass-carrying
daddies.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.973
l saw your lips moving, but it was
your mother's nagging-ass voice--

20:12.177 --> 20:14.907
You leave Mama out of this.
You leave Mama out of this.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.805
All l know is if you spent
half of the time at home...

20:18.016 --> 20:20.280
...you do with those boys,
we wouldn't be having--

20:20.485 --> 20:22.510
-Look, l said l was sorry.
-Oh, whatever--

20:38.937 --> 20:40.529
Clarice.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.066
Clarice, baby, you okay?

20:51.917 --> 20:55.250
-All right, what do you got for me?
-BP is 85l55.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.820
-Resp. is 1 2 and falling.
-Distal pulse is dropping.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.389
-We got a line in.
-There's obvious abdominal edema.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.059
-Get the O.R. ready.
-l'll call.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.751
-Come on, people, let's go.
-Move.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.156
We will take care of her.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.662
-Someone needs to take care of that.
-She needs me.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.891
-lt's hospital policy.
-All right, all right.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.696
-You're hurt, we'll take care of you.
-l got it.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.308
Why don't you spend
a few moments with her?

21:17.509 --> 21:19.204
She's still coming out of anesthesia.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.903
She's under a lot
of pain medication.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.441
You got one tough cookie here.

21:25.651 --> 21:28.620
She told me l wasn't allowed
to remove any of her body parts...

21:28.820 --> 21:30.913
...without her permission.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.988
That's my Reesie.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.017
Tough as nails.

21:36.228 --> 21:39.789
Can l speak to you outside
for a minute?

21:39.998 --> 21:42.398
Mr. Johnson,
this is a very severe injury.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.967
lf she doesn't wanna park
in the handicapped spot...

21:45.170 --> 21:48.537
...the rest of her life, she's gonna need
months of physical therapy.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.231
You need to make her
understand that.

21:51.543 --> 21:52.874
Okay.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.571
-Are you gonna be all right?
-Yeah, thank you.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.078
You're welcome.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.180
How is she doing?

22:00.786 --> 22:02.845
Her leg was broke pretty bad.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.046
ls she gonna be all right?

22:05.757 --> 22:07.224
Yeah.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.554
lt could've been
a lot worse, though.

22:09.761 --> 22:12.321
Yeah, it makes you count
your blessings.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.999
You gonna be able to take over
the team for a while?

22:15.200 --> 22:17.031
-Yeah, don't worry about it.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:17.235 --> 22:19.669
We do most of the work
anyway, right?

22:20.038 --> 22:22.939
Here, look,
l got Clarice some flowers.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.566
She'll like these.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.506
Yeah, l got you a bear.

22:27.713 --> 22:28.975
You got him a bear?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.978
Yes, l got him a bear.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.050
-You bought that for him?
-Brock, yes, l brought him-- Yes.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.310
lt's my money.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.885
Clarice Johnson.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.920
l'm looking for Clarice Johnson.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.422
-She's in Recovery, right there.
-Thank you.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.685
Dave, Dave.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.489
Okay, okay, what--?
Just tell me what happened.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.290
She's okay, all right?

22:48.500 --> 22:51.094
-Now, she had to have surgery--
-Surgery.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.500
-Why didn't you call me sooner?
-Everything was happening so fast.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.934
l wasn't thinking straight.

22:56.141 --> 22:59.042
lt looks like you had time to call
everybody else. Where is she?

22:59.244 --> 23:00.677
-We're gonna go.
-We're gonna go.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.312
-Nice to see you.
-What happened?

23:02.514 --> 23:05.142
-Okay, where is she?
-Okay, it was an accident, all right?

23:05.350 --> 23:08.285
Somebody ran a red light and hit us.
lt just came from nowhere.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.216
You know what?
l don't wanna hear that.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.289
She called me when she was at home
waiting for you.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.256
Now, if you hadn't been late
coaching those kids...

23:16.862 --> 23:20.093
...you would've paid more attention.
You wouldn't have been in a hurry.

23:20.298 --> 23:21.629
This is your fault, Dave.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.095
This is your fault.

23:23.301 --> 23:24.427
Now, where is she?

23:25.203 --> 23:26.966
Two-fifteen.

23:35.046 --> 23:38.413
Once, I heard a radio host
ask the question:

23:39.217 --> 23:42.186
''Why do bad things happen
to good people?''

23:45.023 --> 23:47.719
During Clarice's weeks
in the hospital...

23:48.126 --> 23:50.458
...we asked that question a lot.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.804
I tried to be there for her
in every way a husband should.

24:00.238 --> 24:03.264
But it just seemed
like it was never enough.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.306
And when we came home...

24:05.911 --> 24:09.904
...the reality that everything
had changed began to sink in.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.811
-We gonna get you through this.
-We?

24:13.452 --> 24:17.718
We aren't the ones with their leg
twisted up like a damn pretzel.

24:19.157 --> 24:21.785
Got everything in the house
already taken care of for you.

24:21.993 --> 24:24.860
We got about a week's worth
of meals in the freezer.

24:25.063 --> 24:26.826
When we get inside....

24:27.399 --> 24:28.889
-You all right?
-Yeah.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.864
When we get inside, l'm gonna warm
you up a hot little plate.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.038
-Oh, boy.
-And get some food. l got you.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.366
-l've moved in.
-Mama.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.701
Hey, baby.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.870
Well, don't just stand there.
Bring her on in.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.106
Look, l appreciate your concern
and all that, but l got this, okay?

24:45.317 --> 24:48.650
l'm capable of taking care of my wife,
and l got-- l got you, baby, okay?

24:48.854 --> 24:51.914
Dave, l figured l was gonna have
to break this down to you.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.591
Now, if things was jiggy as all that...

24:54.793 --> 24:56.886
...l wouldn't have to be here now,
would l?

24:57.095 --> 24:59.222
-Okay.
-Like l said, bring her on in here.

24:59.431 --> 25:02.491
-Come on.
-l'm so glad you're here, Mama.

25:02.701 --> 25:03.725
l'm here, baby.

25:03.935 --> 25:04.924
-Dave.
-See that?

25:05.136 --> 25:07.001
-That's what l'm talking about.
-l got it.

25:07.205 --> 25:08.832
-Be careful with her.
-l got it.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.474
So rough.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.508
-She already had one accident.
-Now you gonna break my other foot.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.444
l know, that's what l'm talking about.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.379
The only way you're gonna get
Mama out of the house...

25:25.590 --> 25:27.820
...is to get Clarice back on her feet.

25:28.026 --> 25:32.486
The doctor told me she wants me
to get Clarice into physical therapy.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.995
Oh, you know--?
Remember that girl l had my eye on?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.599
-Which girl?
-No, the girl--

25:36.801 --> 25:39.793
-lt's the girl over at the pool, Julie.
-Oh, okay, l do.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.769
Word around the club
is she's one of the top therapists.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.704
You should give her a call.
See if she makes house calls.

25:45.911 --> 25:49.472
-There you go.
-And then, you know, let me know.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.446
You know what D's problem is?

25:51.650 --> 25:54.141
He hasn't learned from the lessons
l've learned from.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.843
l try to tell you things,
but you do not listen, man.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.216
The other night,
Vanessa's taking a bubble bath.

25:59.424 --> 26:01.892
She's in the tub, looking good.

26:02.093 --> 26:05.654
Normally, that's my green light to go in
there and do what l'm supposed to do.

26:05.864 --> 26:10.096
So l go in there, to get a little cuddly
with her, and she shoved me off.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.702
Like, pushed me.
She's bigger than me, you know that.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.496
So when she pushed me, l fell back.

26:14.706 --> 26:17.368
And she was like, you know,
''Get away, you stinky man.''

26:17.576 --> 26:19.441
Now, what l need to know--
Not wanna know.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.737
What l need to know,
am l a stinky man?

26:22.247 --> 26:23.509
Seriously, like, do l smell?

26:23.715 --> 26:27.412
Am l the friend that stink and
y'all don't tell me, because we close?

26:27.619 --> 26:29.780
-Do l have stinky breath?
-l don't know.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.888
-Do l have stinky breath?
-l don't know.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.955
-Tell me. Smell my breath.
-l'm not gonna.

26:34.159 --> 26:35.990
-Smell my breath.
-l'm not gonna smell--

26:36.194 --> 26:38.219
You're gonna smell my breath.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.629
-l figured that.
-l'm telling you, man.

26:41.833 --> 26:46.861
Even after everything Fiona and l
have been through, l still miss her.

26:47.072 --> 26:51.133
-Are you serious?
-lt's something about the way she....

26:51.343 --> 26:52.469
She crosses those legs...

26:52.677 --> 26:57.239
...and she just bounces
those high heels up and down.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.849
My thing is when l just get home...

27:00.051 --> 27:02.451
...Reesie's just getting out
the shower.

27:02.654 --> 27:06.613
She puts on one
of my little old tank tops.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.290
Starts painting her toenails.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.091
You know what l like?

27:11.296 --> 27:12.490
l like it....

27:12.697 --> 27:17.225
l like it when Vanessa has me rub
this skin cream on her back.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.733
She's got bad eczema.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.462
Big bumps on her back.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.368
And it needs to be moisturized.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.805
And l do it. l do it.

27:26.011 --> 27:31.005
lt's a little rocky moisturizing roll
on her back, but l don't mind.

27:31.216 --> 27:34.708
Because that's what she has me do,
you know.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.819
-Years l've been doing that.
-Tree.

27:37.722 --> 27:39.280
-Are you crying?
-What?

27:39.491 --> 27:43.723
-Are you crying? No, look at me.
-Come on, l'm enjoying myself, right?

27:43.928 --> 27:45.953
-You are crying.
-l'm not crying, man.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.722
lt's not even tears, man.

27:47.932 --> 27:51.026
l feel like these women
got us in a beam, so we--

27:51.236 --> 27:56.196
They got us in one of them
Star Wars contractor-beam things.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.774
lt's pulling us in.
You know what l'm talking about?

27:58.977 --> 28:03.243
lt's like we couldn't escape that beam
if we wanted to, you know.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.541
lt's like you want to, but you love it.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.581
You love it so much that you can't.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.344
You can't escape it.

28:09.954 --> 28:12.855
lt's an interesting way of putting it,
Star Wars.

28:13.058 --> 28:16.255
-That's what you said, Star Wars?
-Star Wars, man, it's a beam.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.861
lt's a beam, it's like a light.
They shine it at you.

28:19.397 --> 28:22.423
lt mess with your body, your nerves
and stuff, and you can't move.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.296
You just gotta allow yourself
to get pulled in.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.937
And l'm getting pulled in.

28:28.139 --> 28:31.336
You need to get pulled in
and you need to get pulled in.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.874
Accept it, man.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.841
Accept your life.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.513
-l accept mine.
-No, no, no.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.706
-You're right, l probably had enough.
-Yeah.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.282
l probably had too many.

28:44.756 --> 28:48.624
-Oh, no, honey, we're not buying--
-l got this, l got this.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.091
l hope l have the right address.
l'm Julie Sawyer.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.321
You called for an in-home
physical therapist?

28:53.531 --> 28:54.691
-Yeah, that's right.
-Okay.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.924
-Dave Johnson, come on in.
-Nice to meet you.

28:57.135 --> 29:00.002
Reesie, this is the physical therapist
l was telling you about.

29:00.205 --> 29:03.174
Please have a seat.
This is Miss Sawyer.

29:03.374 --> 29:06.537
And l'm Mrs. Clark, her mother.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.508
How do you do?

29:09.214 --> 29:10.408
Mrs. Johnson?

29:11.216 --> 29:14.549
Look, Mrs. Johnson,
l know after all you've been through...

29:14.753 --> 29:17.551
...the last thing you want
is a stranger in your life, so....

29:17.756 --> 29:19.553
How about we get to know
each other--?

29:19.758 --> 29:24.161
l'm not looking for anyone
to psychoanalyze me either.

29:24.796 --> 29:29.233
Okay, well, that's good,
because that's not why l'm here.

29:30.368 --> 29:31.733
But, you know, to be honest...

29:31.936 --> 29:34.166
...talking about how you're feeling
emotionally...

29:34.372 --> 29:36.670
...can help me design a better plan
to get you on--

29:39.477 --> 29:42.969
How l feel.
Lord Jesus, where did y'all find her?

29:43.181 --> 29:45.979
How l feel?
You wanna know how l feel?

29:46.184 --> 29:49.017
l feel like Humpty Dumpty,
that's how l feel.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.586
Clarice, you need to calm down.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.350
Let this woman do her job.

29:54.859 --> 29:56.918
Now, you do know
what you're doing, right?

29:57.128 --> 29:58.959
Yes, ma'am.

29:59.164 --> 30:02.292
Mrs. Johnson, l understand.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.868
So why don't l just come back
tomorrow, and we'll begin then?

30:07.071 --> 30:08.766
Bingo, that's a great place to start.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.066
How about you come back never?
What about that?

30:11.276 --> 30:14.939
-That works for me.
-Okay, no, we're gonna do this today.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.114
And you're gonna calm down.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.745
You stop acting like this.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.044
Come on now.

30:22.754 --> 30:26.884
Just leave me alone, okay?
Just leave me alone.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.293
Just....

30:39.971 --> 30:43.168
The bishop used to tell a story
about Adam and Eve.

30:43.374 --> 30:46.502
When God made Adam,
he instructed him to do three things:

30:46.711 --> 30:50.875
-Work, cultivate, protect.
-Two, three, down.

30:51.416 --> 30:55.011
-That's great.
-Oh, my God, that's incredible, okay.

30:55.987 --> 30:58.182
What we're gonna do today
is have a little fun.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.321
Down through history,
men have been measured...

31:01.526 --> 31:04.256
...by how hard they've worked
and cultivated...

31:04.462 --> 31:07.659
...by how well they've protected
their wives and children.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.400
Down, three, two, one.

31:12.604 --> 31:18.042
Up again. Up, one, two, three, hold.

31:18.243 --> 31:19.301
In the old days...

31:19.510 --> 31:23.970
...women saw their men
as conquerors, providers, heroes.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.207
But somewhere along the line,
that changed.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.380
Push, push.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.850
Women started becoming
their own heroes.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.215
Okay, how's this there?

31:32.423 --> 31:35.119
Maybe it was because their men
forgot how to be heroic.

31:36.461 --> 31:39.487
Or because women
didn't wanna be protected anymore.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.325
Or maybe women
had to be their own heroes...

31:42.533 --> 31:45.696
...because of the pain
they had to endure in life.

31:58.716 --> 32:00.081
Look, he's handsome.

32:00.285 --> 32:02.082
-Bryson.
-Bryson.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.778
He's so handsome.

32:05.823 --> 32:08.121
But whatever the cause...

32:08.326 --> 32:11.989
...the world took away
a man's reasons for being a man.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.827
They told him
he wasn't important anymore.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.002
And when that happened...

32:18.870 --> 32:22.533
...it turned the whole world
upside-down.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.778
-l don't know how to thank you.
-You don't need to.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.917
You really don't.
You know what you can do?

32:34.118 --> 32:36.484
You could write a letter
to my boss at the clinic...

32:36.688 --> 32:39.782
...saying you've never met a skilled
or more professional therapist.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.288
l wanna thank you too, Julie.

32:41.492 --> 32:43.289
Look at her.
She's doing extremely well.

32:43.494 --> 32:45.826
Yes, you are truly gifted
at what you do.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.292
Thank you.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.092
-Okay, l'll see you Monday?
-Yeah.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.929
-Okay, great.
-Get home safely, okay?

32:53.137 --> 32:54.126
-l will.
-Take care.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.273
-Enjoy your evening, okay?
-l will.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.442
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, what's up?

32:59.243 --> 33:01.040
Not much.

33:04.115 --> 33:06.549
No, no, no, don't worry.
lt does it all the time.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.776
lt's probably just the battery.
l'll be fine.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.787
-lt sounds more than just the battery.
-No, no, please go on inside, go on.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.822
Nonsense,
you can't be late for your son.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.391
-Dave will run you home.
-Good.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.459
-No, it's my hoop night.
-Hoops night?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.223
l ain't gonna miss my night.
l can call her a tow truck.

33:21.432 --> 33:24.162
Miss your hoops, are you insane?

33:24.369 --> 33:27.338
You're missing the point here.
This woman saved your wife's life.

33:27.538 --> 33:30.302
-He can miss his hoops.
-Okay, l don't wanna put anyone out.

33:30.508 --> 33:34.205
-lt'll make me feel worse, please.
-Little girl, little girl.

33:34.412 --> 33:36.539
Get your ass in this car.

33:40.251 --> 33:41.240
Let me ask a question.

33:41.452 --> 33:46.219
l have a friend who has actually
been wanting to ask you out on a date.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.191
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.687
But he's in a complicated situation.

33:50.895 --> 33:52.726
Oh, God, no, don't tell me.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.421
He's recently broken up
or getting divorced...

33:55.633 --> 33:58.067
...or lives with his mother?

33:59.203 --> 34:00.329
Getting divorced.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.006
No, l appreciate that,
but l think l'll pass.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.232
Single mothers
don't have a lot of options...

34:05.443 --> 34:09.708
...but l don't really need
to be his rebound relationship.

34:10.313 --> 34:11.871
lf it's all the same.

34:13.016 --> 34:14.449
So how long
has he been swimming?

34:14.652 --> 34:17.678
Oh, as soon as l could get him
in the water. He loves it.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.018
-Hey, Bry.
-Hi, Mom.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.385
This is Dave. His wife's my patient.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.561
-Remember, the ones in the accident?
-Right.

34:24.762 --> 34:26.696
-How do you do, sir?
-How's it going?

34:26.898 --> 34:30.561
My car broke down again,
but Dave offered to give us a ride.

34:30.768 --> 34:31.757
Cool.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.135
So you like baseball, Bryson?

34:34.338 --> 34:36.237
Well, l've always wanted to try it.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.737
But Mom throws like a girl.

34:37.942 --> 34:39.034
Watch it.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.609
Well, l coach a team
over at East Side Field...

34:41.813 --> 34:44.246
...and if you want,
you could stop by some time...

34:44.449 --> 34:46.212
...and l could show you
a few pointers.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.714
-Really?
-Yeah.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.717
That would be totally sick.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.911
Oh, ours is....

34:52.123 --> 34:53.385
The street up there.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.719
The minute l get in the house,
l'll call for a tow for that car.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.418
You don't have to do that.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.460
l know a mechanic
that owes me a favor...

35:00.665 --> 35:02.394
...so l'll have him take a look at it.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.828
Clarice and l owe you.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.935
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, no problem.

35:06.137 --> 35:07.661
Thank you.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.414
All right.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.639
-All right.
-Lord, yes.

35:18.850 --> 35:19.908
Oh, yeah.

35:21.219 --> 35:23.414
-All right.
-Praise the Lord.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.755
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.748
Hallelujah.

35:33.231 --> 35:36.359
Jesus called out to the multitudes.

35:36.567 --> 35:39.593
-He said, ''Come to me.
-Come.

35:39.804 --> 35:44.104
-All who are weary, come to me.
-Come to me.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.242
-And l will give you rest.''
-Yes, he will.

35:46.444 --> 35:50.608
He said, ''l will give you rest
if you come to me.''

35:50.815 --> 35:51.804
Amen.

35:52.016 --> 35:56.214
So today, l want you to stand up
and come down to the altar.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.409
Come down.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.147
I always felt church
is like a hospital.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.491
It's where sick people go
to get well.

36:03.694 --> 36:06.561
Anybody out there
that needs praying for today.

36:06.764 --> 36:09.198
Or maybe you just need
just a little encouragement.

36:09.867 --> 36:10.925
Jesus said....

36:11.135 --> 36:14.593
Whenever I went to church,
I felt hope.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.774
Come on, come to me.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.102
-Yes.
-Amen.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.573
Glory, hallelujah.

36:21.779 --> 36:25.476
Girl, when l saw you,
hey, l almost went in.

36:25.683 --> 36:28.083
l said my D was looking
like Miss America...

36:28.286 --> 36:29.548
-...up in here.
-Stop it.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.416
l hope this don't mean you're about
to come back to work...

36:32.623 --> 36:34.682
...and l gotta start fighting you
for clients.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.917
-Well....
-Oh, you know, l meant to tell you.

36:37.128 --> 36:40.427
Mr. Hastings forced me to take some
of your clients while you were gone.

36:40.631 --> 36:41.996
Girl, don't worry about that.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.293
-l would do the same thing to you.
-Okay.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.266
But you better bring
your boxing gloves to work.

36:47.471 --> 36:49.598
Girl, l can't fight.
l just got my nails done.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.900
You crazy, come here, girl.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.004
lt was really good to see you folks
in church today.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.114
Well, with what we've been through,
it's good to be seen.

36:58.316 --> 37:00.011
The Lord's been good, bishop.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.652
Clarice has got her trainer,
has her walking again...

37:02.853 --> 37:05.845
...and Dave's been a real trouper.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.082
No, no, you have.

37:08.292 --> 37:11.261
We are here for you, 2 4l7.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.362
Even if you just wanna come in
and talk.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.998
-Come here.
-lt is so good to see you.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.498
-You too, love you.
-l love you too, girl.

37:18.703 --> 37:19.761
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.268
You better bring your gloves.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.064
l'm glad it ain't a street fight...

37:23.274 --> 37:26.243
...because you know l don't wanna get
my face scratched up.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.503
Hey, baby, how you doing?

37:28.713 --> 37:30.772
-Okay, take care of my girl.
-Todd, let's go.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.847
Come on, now,
you know l'm hungry.

37:33.050 --> 37:34.483
l got to get to brunch.

37:34.685 --> 37:35.913
You're walking all slow.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.229
lt's sickening, man.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.761
He really disgusts me, dude.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.327
-Hi, Julie.
-Yes?

37:51.535 --> 37:55.301
l'm Brock Houseman.
l'm a friend of Dave Johnson's.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.535
Yeah, l....

37:57.742 --> 37:59.334
Has he mentioned me at all?

38:00.711 --> 38:02.736
Yeah-- No, well....

38:02.947 --> 38:06.007
Bet you $ 1 0, he's gonna take
all the credit for fixing the car.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.516
You fixed my car?
l don't know what to say.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.950
-No, don't.
-Thank you. No, you don't understand.

38:12.156 --> 38:13.851
Don't say anything. lt's my pleasure.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.083
Why are we even here?
Tell me why we're here.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.818
We're part of the problem, man.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.190
-No, we're accomplices.
-No, we're not, you are.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.491
-All right.
-You drove, l'm not a part of this.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.327
-Look at him.
-Look, look, look.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.503
What? Why are you so happy?

38:27.538 --> 38:30.632
-What?
-Nothing, nothing at all, Satan.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.138
Satan? Hey, hey, l--

38:32.343 --> 38:34.038
l can't help it. l am not ashamed.

38:34.245 --> 38:36.839
-Get in the back.
-l have no problem getting in the back.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.675
Better not tell Vanessa l was here.

38:39.216 --> 38:40.513
So l think you can see...

38:40.718 --> 38:43.812
...how a retail space in this
neighborhood can be a home run.

38:44.021 --> 38:46.489
Well, l like what l see, Clarice.

38:46.691 --> 38:50.058
-lt's actually quite impressive, really.
-Yeah, it has lots of potential.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.786
Excuse me,
who will be taking the check?

38:52.997 --> 38:55.295
-We will. Sure?
-No, no, no, l got it.

38:55.499 --> 38:56.659
-Please, l insist.
-No, l--

38:56.867 --> 38:57.925
-l insist.
-No, l got it.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.727
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, l'm positive.

38:59.937 --> 39:01.598
Go ahead, Dave.

39:05.609 --> 39:08.100
-Thank you very much.
-You're so welcome.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.746
lt's nice to see you back up
on your feet now.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.314
lt is so good to be back.

39:13.718 --> 39:15.549
l can only imagine.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.813
Dave, tell me, l'm interested
in getting your perspective.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.015
What's it like to have a wife
who is as progressive as Clarice?

39:22.560 --> 39:25.688
Well, you know,
anything Clarice puts her mind to...

39:25.896 --> 39:29.161
...is gonna be successful,
so you guys are in good hands.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.834
Oh, impressive.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.526
As a general contractor,
l thought you might be able...

39:33.738 --> 39:35.763
...to weigh in
and share your perspectives...

39:35.973 --> 39:38.840
...from a professional level
on the architectural flow chart...

39:39.043 --> 39:40.772
...that she's presented to us today.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.572
Well, see, with this particular project,
my approach....

39:43.781 --> 39:46.511
l mean, l would approach it
in a way that....

39:47.551 --> 39:50.384
Actually, the projects l work on
are a little bit smaller.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.523
-About 3000 to 5000 square feet.
-Dave, Dave, don't be so--

39:53.724 --> 39:58.127
He's just being modest. David owns
a very lucrative construction company.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.591
-Really?
-Yes, sweetheart.

39:59.797 --> 40:02.561
l was just letting them know
that the projects l normally--

40:02.767 --> 40:05.429
You don't have to let everybody
know everything. lt's okay.

40:05.636 --> 40:08.400
-We're looking to get into--
-l was just telling the man--

40:08.606 --> 40:11.439
-Don't tell the man everything.
-Maybe we could work together.

40:11.642 --> 40:15.078
You might be able to be the general
contractor, do the finish-out work.

40:15.279 --> 40:17.907
-Yeah.
-Perfect, l think that's a great idea.

40:18.115 --> 40:21.312
Excuse me, sir, l'm sorry,
but your card has been declined.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.549
You know what?
lt's gotta be a mistake.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.779
-We'll take care of it.
-No, no, no, l can--

40:25.990 --> 40:27.787
Let me give you another credit card.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.483
Did l bring it with me?
l brought the American Express.

40:30.694 --> 40:32.127
-Do l have it?
-Think you got it.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.991
-Clarice, please.
-No, l can do it.

40:35.199 --> 40:37.258
l'll handle this.

40:37.468 --> 40:38.901
Thank you.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.566
Thank you.

40:48.245 --> 40:49.678
Nice music.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.974
Oh, and the food....

41:00.491 --> 41:03.722
l've never been so humiliated
in all of my life.

41:03.928 --> 41:06.624
-You realize how you made me look?
-How l made you look?

41:06.831 --> 41:10.062
Well, if l embarrassed you in front
of Mr. Big-Time-Development-Head...

41:10.267 --> 41:11.291
...that's too damn bad.

41:11.502 --> 41:14.335
Think twice before you open
your big-ass mouth talking about--

41:14.538 --> 41:19.703
Big-ass-- lt is irresponsible of you to
be over your limit on your credit card.

41:19.910 --> 41:22.276
Do you mean to tell me
you don't have $200?

41:23.447 --> 41:25.278
-l'm done.
-While you was recuperating...

41:25.483 --> 41:28.145
...l was the only one bringing money
up into this house.

41:28.352 --> 41:29.580
l was the one paying bills.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.414
Overextended? lt's because of you.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.752
-This mortgage's about to bankrupt us.
-Oh, please, don't be so dramatic.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.123
This mortgage
is not going to bankrupt us.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.094
And as soon as l clean up
this little mess you made...

41:42.299 --> 41:43.357
...we will be fine.

41:43.567 --> 41:46.900
We're gonna take the insurance
money, put it down on an Escalade.

41:47.104 --> 41:50.369
l just let you talk me into buying a 300.
We ain't buying no Escalade.

41:50.574 --> 41:54.340
My clients don't ride in anything
but an Escalade, okay?

41:54.545 --> 41:58.811
-They're gonna be walking, then.
-Hey, hey, hey, settle down.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.979
l can hear y'all all the way upstairs.

42:01.185 --> 42:04.348
And if l can hear you,
the whole neighborhood can hear you.

42:04.555 --> 42:05.988
And you know what, Dave?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.488
l've been waiting to tell you this
for a long time.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.592
Maybe if you stop
spending so much time...

42:10.794 --> 42:13.490
...with them little gangsters-in-training
down there...

42:13.697 --> 42:16.962
...and spend more time in this house
handling your business...

42:17.167 --> 42:19.397
...you wouldn't be having
this argument right now.

42:19.603 --> 42:21.833
You better stop talking
about my boys like that.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.802
Now, look, l said what l got to say.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.976
You know what, Mama?
l got this, l got this.

42:26.176 --> 42:29.543
David, l have worked too hard
to get us to where we are...

42:29.747 --> 42:32.716
...and hell will freeze over
before l let you take us backward--

42:32.917 --> 42:34.612
-Know what you need to work on?
-What?

42:34.818 --> 42:38.049
Work on not being in a fantasyland,
trying to be somebody that you not.

42:38.255 --> 42:40.246
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.425
-Don't talk to my daughter like that.
-That's my wife.

42:43.627 --> 42:46.790
-l'll talk to her any way l want.
-Don't talk to my mother like that.

42:46.997 --> 42:49.465
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

42:53.003 --> 42:54.766
l'm out of here.

42:57.041 --> 43:01.478
-Wait a minute, Dave--
-Hey, don't you dare run after him.

43:24.568 --> 43:28.595
Sometimes when you don't know
where to turn...

43:28.806 --> 43:31.434
...you got to turn to what you know.

43:31.642 --> 43:36.579
I knew my chair, my records,
my music.

43:38.048 --> 43:42.542
Only problem is,
when the song is over...

43:42.953 --> 43:45.547
...you're right back
where you started.

43:52.730 --> 43:56.359
l'm telling you, l don't know how much
longer l can put up with all this drama.

43:56.567 --> 43:59.934
Then why don't you just try to sit
Clarice down and talk it all through?

44:00.137 --> 44:02.037
l could talk all day long.

44:02.239 --> 44:05.106
l think her and her mother
are missing the listening gene.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.298
Brock Houseman.

44:07.678 --> 44:09.441
Yes, ma'am,
thanks for calling me back.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.512
Look, l was hoping
we could talk about--

44:13.350 --> 44:14.408
ls that right?

44:14.618 --> 44:17.382
No, no, l understand.
l'm just sorry to hear that.

44:17.855 --> 44:19.220
l will let him know.

44:19.423 --> 44:20.515
Okay, bye.

44:22.059 --> 44:23.253
Darius' mom.

44:23.460 --> 44:26.429
She said Darnell still won't let the boy
back on the team.

44:26.630 --> 44:29.724
What's he trying to do?
Guarantee his son ends up like him?

44:31.001 --> 44:33.993
-What's Julie doing here?
-l never thought they'd show up.

44:34.204 --> 44:36.695
Well, l'm glad she did.
l'm feeling a little leg cramp.

44:36.907 --> 44:39.603
-Maybe she could rub it out.
-See, there you go.

44:40.477 --> 44:42.308
-All right, this is Bryson.
-Hey, Bryson.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.505
-He's gonna be having fun with us.
-Oh, what's cracking, y'all?

44:46.116 --> 44:48.346
Somebody be watching
too much BET.

44:48.552 --> 44:51.919
-All right, come on.
-That's enough. Hit the field, let's go.

44:54.291 --> 44:55.918
-Nice swing.
-That's okay, Bryson.

44:56.126 --> 44:59.493
Keep your eye on the ball, give me
a swing, make contact. You got it.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.130
Here we go.

45:03.133 --> 45:06.660
Yo, coach, my little sister could hit
that pitch and she's blind in one eye.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.031
Oh, come on,
my grandma can hit that.

45:09.239 --> 45:11.230
-Bryson, come here.
-My goodness, you suck.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.239
Get off the field, man.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.510
Listen, it's okay, all right?
l don't want you to listen to any of that.

45:17.715 --> 45:18.704
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

45:18.916 --> 45:22.443
Now, l want you to go back up there.
l want it just to be you and the ball.

45:23.087 --> 45:24.179
-Okay.
-You got that?

45:24.388 --> 45:26.720
-Let's go, buddy, here we go.
-Okay.

45:26.924 --> 45:28.414
-Let's go, come on.
-Here we go.

45:52.850 --> 45:54.374
See that?

45:56.453 --> 45:58.785
Good job, Bryson, good job.

46:03.927 --> 46:05.485
Nice hit, dog.

46:11.401 --> 46:13.232
Good job, Bryson.

46:13.570 --> 46:14.559
Good job.

46:14.772 --> 46:18.833
Hey, Julie, l wanted to give you
my contact info.

46:19.042 --> 46:22.478
You know, just in case Bryson ever
wants to come back to practice again.

46:22.679 --> 46:24.977
-Or when your car breaks down.
-Thanks.

46:25.182 --> 46:26.308
Or dinner.

46:26.817 --> 46:28.375
-Dinner, okay.
-Okay, no.

46:28.585 --> 46:31.076
-Coffee, doesn't have to be dinner.
-No, it's not that.

46:31.288 --> 46:35.019
lt's just l probably
should just stop you right there.

46:35.225 --> 46:37.693
l feel like l've dated you before.

46:37.895 --> 46:40.125
No, no, no,
l would have remembered that.

46:40.330 --> 46:43.458
No, not you, your type, and l....

46:43.834 --> 46:44.823
l get it, okay.

46:45.035 --> 46:47.003
You just wanna cut
past the foreplay.

46:47.204 --> 46:49.798
-lt's okay.
-Okay, l guess, l--

46:50.007 --> 46:51.406
No, l know what you mean.

46:51.608 --> 46:54.236
No offense, because l really
appreciate you fixing my car.

46:54.444 --> 46:56.674
But l just don't have the time
or the energy.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.404
You know, dating's not my thing.

46:58.615 --> 47:00.173
My kid's my thing.

47:00.384 --> 47:03.683
So if l were to get
into a relationship...

47:03.887 --> 47:07.118
...it would have to be with someone
who could be a potential husband...

47:07.324 --> 47:11.260
...and a father to my son, and
l'm pretty sure that's not your thing.

47:11.461 --> 47:12.894
No, l....

47:13.096 --> 47:15.894
-Well, l could do that.
-You could?

47:16.099 --> 47:17.361
-Sure.
-Okay.

47:17.568 --> 47:19.502
Bryson, grab your bag. We gotta go.

47:19.703 --> 47:21.603
Okay.

47:21.905 --> 47:23.930
You're not gonna stalk me now,
are you?

47:24.141 --> 47:27.474
-Not unless you want me to.
-l think l'll take a pass on that.

47:28.011 --> 47:30.070
l'm really glad
we had this conversation.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.474
Cleared everything up.

47:31.882 --> 47:32.871
Call me, okay?

47:33.083 --> 47:36.109
-Good job out there today.
-Bye, thanks, coach.

47:37.721 --> 47:40.554
She will not leave me alone.

47:40.757 --> 47:44.056
-l'm telling you, she wants me.
-Yeah, l could see it all over her face.

47:44.261 --> 47:45.250
-Can you?
-Yeah.

47:45.462 --> 47:47.396
Really?
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

48:15.459 --> 48:17.359
College boy,
what the hell you want?

48:17.561 --> 48:21.998
Got a beef with me, let's do it. Don't
kill your son's future because of it.

48:22.199 --> 48:24.133
What l do with my son,
that's my business.

48:24.334 --> 48:27.792
l'm making it my business. Knock
that victim chip off your shoulder.

48:28.005 --> 48:29.836
Or Darius is gonna end up
just like you.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.099
Your punk ass would know
all about that too.

48:32.309 --> 48:36.405
When are you gonna stop blaming the
world for punching my college ticket?

48:36.613 --> 48:38.581
Didn't nobody force you
to sling that crack.

48:38.782 --> 48:41.683
What l do with my son,
it's my son, it's my business.

48:41.885 --> 48:44.479
Well, give your son an opportunity.

48:47.391 --> 48:49.256
Hey, and the next time
you come up here...

48:49.459 --> 48:51.654
...you better come up here strapped.

48:54.197 --> 48:56.529
Talking that beef garbage.

48:59.703 --> 49:02.638
Carmen, I've been looking
for two days for you.

49:02.973 --> 49:04.099
For two days, Carmencita.

49:04.308 --> 49:06.572
I inquired at the factory,
and you were absent.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.507
Why do we have to watch this?
Can't we watch something else?

49:09.713 --> 49:12.511
Girl, shut up, you know
we ain't changing this channel.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.081
Hello?

49:17.220 --> 49:18.847
Yeah, hold on a second.

49:19.056 --> 49:20.785
To the magi-- Magistrate.

49:20.991 --> 49:22.322
To the magistrate?

49:22.526 --> 49:24.585
He'll send me to prison.
I can't go to prison.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.696
It's just he died in the prison.
And I had no money to survive--

49:27.898 --> 49:30.594
Coach, hey, can you come
to my swim meet Saturday...

49:30.801 --> 49:32.325
...so l can show you my stuff?

49:33.337 --> 49:36.431
lt would have to be in the afternoon.
We have a game in the morning.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.471
Okay, cool, l'll see you at the pool.

49:38.675 --> 49:40.040
Give me that phone.

49:40.243 --> 49:42.803
l'm so sorry, honestly,
and if it's too much pressure--

49:43.013 --> 49:44.446
No, no, look, it's no problem.

49:44.648 --> 49:45.672
Tell him l'll be there.

49:45.882 --> 49:47.543
Oh, I know. Believe me, I know.

49:48.352 --> 49:50.479
-Are you seeing this?
-What?

49:50.988 --> 49:54.355
Since when he gotta go outside
to answer a phone call?

49:54.558 --> 49:57.550
I'm not afraid of hard work.
I'm a good, honest, working girl.

49:57.761 --> 49:59.251
But who would take care of me--?

49:59.463 --> 50:02.193
Honey, l spent too many years
with your raggedy-ass daddy...

50:02.399 --> 50:04.162
...to know when something's wrong.

50:08.505 --> 50:09.631
See this?

50:09.840 --> 50:12.240
These movies had romance.

50:12.442 --> 50:14.307
Good movies, good writing.

50:14.511 --> 50:19.244
I'm ready to go now, soldier.
Please take me away from here.

50:46.410 --> 50:49.345
-This scares me, David.
-What?

50:49.546 --> 50:51.309
This.

50:52.616 --> 50:55.585
The silence between us.

50:57.921 --> 51:00.151
l was thinking,
with our anniversary coming up...

51:00.357 --> 51:03.986
...maybe we should just get away
for the weekend, you know?

51:04.194 --> 51:07.186
Because l know it's been stressful
since the accident, l know.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.092
lt's been a lot longer than that.

51:10.700 --> 51:14.261
Okay, that's fair.

51:17.641 --> 51:22.169
l've never felt
some of the feelings l'm feeling...

51:22.379 --> 51:24.779
...and l just don't know
how to deal with them.

51:25.348 --> 51:28.249
l guess what scares me the most
is you pulling away like this...

51:28.452 --> 51:31.046
...because it's not like you, David.

51:35.826 --> 51:38.386
Can we talk
to someone about it, please?

51:40.464 --> 51:42.227
lf that's what you want.

52:03.420 --> 52:08.289
Since the accident, l know l've been
a little difficult to get along with.

52:08.492 --> 52:11.825
l know that.
And l've been depressed, you know?

52:12.028 --> 52:15.464
And that should be understandable.
l'm getting over a major injury.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.230
But David's pulling away
and l don't know why.

52:19.436 --> 52:24.100
l-- l feel like he's doing it on purpose.
Like l've done something.

52:24.307 --> 52:27.333
Like he's paying me back for
something l don't even know l've done.

52:27.544 --> 52:32.709
And then he spends all of his time with
these boys, this Little League team.

52:32.916 --> 52:35.316
And that's time he could be
spending with me at home.

52:35.519 --> 52:37.919
Working on our marriage.

52:38.388 --> 52:43.257
Dave, what do you wanna say
to Clarice right now?

52:43.727 --> 52:44.887
l mean, what's the point?

52:45.095 --> 52:47.529
You heard her.
She has everything figured out, so....

52:47.731 --> 52:50.165
You see what l mean?
This attitude is--

52:50.367 --> 52:53.393
lt makes my skin crawl
because that's not us, bishop.

52:53.603 --> 52:56.629
We used to talk things through.
We talked about everything--

52:56.840 --> 52:59.400
No, no, we never used to
talk about everything, okay?

52:59.609 --> 53:01.042
You used to do all the talking.

53:01.244 --> 53:03.542
l used to sit,
listen to her and her mother cackle.

53:03.747 --> 53:06.045
Cac-- He has no respect
for my mother.

53:06.249 --> 53:07.716
-Let's just--
-Mama loves you.

53:07.918 --> 53:10.011
No, no, she doesn't love me,
she tolerates me.

53:10.220 --> 53:12.586
Because she loves you.
But l'm cool with that.

53:12.789 --> 53:15.587
-Can't believe you just sit up in this--
-Dave, Clarice.

53:17.694 --> 53:19.184
Why do you say that, Dave?

53:20.096 --> 53:22.155
Well, the truth of the matter,
bishop...

53:22.365 --> 53:27.530
...is that l feel like
l'm just visiting this marriage.

53:28.872 --> 53:29.930
See? See?

53:30.140 --> 53:32.904
l mean, nothing l ever do,
nothing l ever say is ever enough.

53:33.109 --> 53:34.201
-Oh, God.
-That's honest.

53:34.411 --> 53:37.539
-Please, that's David being dramatic.
-Clarice.

53:37.747 --> 53:39.942
-You should get an award for that one.
-Clarice.

53:41.284 --> 53:44.014
What irks you about Dave
coaching those Little Leaguers?

53:44.221 --> 53:46.689
He's never home, bishop.
You know?

53:46.890 --> 53:50.417
He's always with them.
He's always with those boys.

53:50.627 --> 53:52.959
That's all he cares about.

53:53.163 --> 53:57.395
You mean like what a father
would like to do if he had a son?

53:57.601 --> 53:58.727
Maybe.

53:58.935 --> 54:03.634
-But he knows we can't afford children.
-No, we can afford kids, okay?

54:03.840 --> 54:07.105
lf someone didn't live beyond
their means, we could afford kids.

54:07.310 --> 54:08.641
Please, David.

54:09.546 --> 54:11.878
Look at us, look at us.

54:12.082 --> 54:16.382
Trying to fix our marriage. Do you
really think a baby is gonna help?

54:16.586 --> 54:19.714
-l used to.
-That's enough.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.982
Are you finished?

54:23.827 --> 54:26.728
Do the two of you remember
how I told you on your wedding day...

54:26.930 --> 54:29.558
...how hard life can be?

54:30.667 --> 54:32.225
Well, that three-stranded cord...

54:32.435 --> 54:36.804
...I wrapped around your shoulders
that day, will always be there.

54:37.641 --> 54:40.474
Unless, of course,
you've chosen to remove it.

55:07.504 --> 55:09.472
Does that feel good?

55:24.454 --> 55:26.854
Dave.

55:41.004 --> 55:42.995
Are you okay?

55:43.707 --> 55:45.174
You were moaning.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.506
Yeah, l was....

55:52.148 --> 55:54.480
l'm gonna get a drink of water.

56:17.874 --> 56:19.466
l guess that makes it ours.

56:19.676 --> 56:22.474
-Yes.
-Oh, l love it, Clarice.

56:22.679 --> 56:25.773
And you managed to keep it alive
while we made up our minds.

56:25.982 --> 56:29.315
Well, actually it was Michelle here
who kept it alive...

56:29.519 --> 56:31.953
...and that's why she's gonna share
in the commission.

56:32.422 --> 56:33.514
-Well, thank you.
-Okay.

56:33.723 --> 56:36.123
-l've got to get to the courthouse.
-No, you don't.

56:36.326 --> 56:39.193
You first have to see new tile samples
for the master bathroom.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.489
l got a full caseload.
Court won't wait for me.

56:41.698 --> 56:43.859
The tile samples.

56:46.569 --> 56:48.400
Yes.

56:50.607 --> 56:52.097
Yes.

56:54.911 --> 56:56.606
Okay, Clarice, what's wrong?

56:56.813 --> 56:59.680
We just closed one
of the biggest deals of your life...

56:59.883 --> 57:02.408
...and you walking around
like somebody stole your bike.

57:02.619 --> 57:04.644
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

57:04.854 --> 57:06.287
-l'm fine.
-Nothing, yes, it is.

57:06.489 --> 57:08.218
Tell me, come on now.

57:08.425 --> 57:09.858
This is me, tell it.

57:10.059 --> 57:12.721
lt's-- l'm just having
one of those days, okay?

57:12.929 --> 57:14.419
Just....

57:15.098 --> 57:19.592
Do not make me go Oprah on you,
because l will.

57:23.006 --> 57:25.338
l think David's having an affair.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.206
-What?
-Yes.

57:28.411 --> 57:30.174
Oh, honey, are you sure?

57:30.380 --> 57:33.281
Yes, Michelle.
l can see it in his eyes.

57:34.350 --> 57:37.114
lt's always in the eyes, ain't it?

57:38.087 --> 57:40.146
And it's my physical therapist.

57:40.356 --> 57:42.620
What?
That skinny little white thing?

57:43.092 --> 57:44.491
-lt's Julie Sawyer.
-Okay.

57:44.694 --> 57:46.389
Oh, girl. What?

57:46.596 --> 57:49.326
You got to go over there
and open up a good old can...

57:49.532 --> 57:51.659
...of soul-sister power
on her narrow behind.

57:51.868 --> 57:54.666
l can't do that.
l don't have any real proof.

57:55.271 --> 57:57.705
We got to go over there
and snatch her.

57:57.907 --> 58:00.398
Michelle, l can't do that.

58:00.610 --> 58:03.010
Snatch her by her hair...

58:03.213 --> 58:08.651
...and squeeze until that heifer tell us
everything we wanna know, okay?

58:08.852 --> 58:10.911
You want me to do it?

58:11.120 --> 58:12.382
Look at me, look at me.

58:13.223 --> 58:16.386
Don't go all
Waiting to Exhale on me.

58:16.593 --> 58:18.322
Dave is too good a man
for you to lose.

58:18.528 --> 58:21.224
And you don't want
to do something all crazy...

58:21.431 --> 58:22.728
...that you can't take back.

58:22.932 --> 58:25.400
Now, you take that from me. l know.

58:25.602 --> 58:28.002
Don't tell me Todd is cheating too.

58:30.707 --> 58:31.731
l did the cheating.

58:31.941 --> 58:33.636
-What?
-l know.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.572
Don't look at me like that, l know.

58:35.778 --> 58:39.009
How--?
How was he able to forgive you?

58:40.016 --> 58:44.316
lt was not easy, okay?
lt took a long time.

58:44.521 --> 58:48.548
But he forgave me, after all that.

58:48.758 --> 58:52.660
And l will never sacrifice
his heart like that again.

58:53.663 --> 58:55.528
Yeah, well,
that's good for you guys...

58:55.732 --> 59:00.863
...but l just don't think
l have it in me to do that.

59:01.070 --> 59:03.538
Yes, you do.

59:04.474 --> 59:07.534
Now, are you sure you don't want me
to go snatch the white girl?

59:07.744 --> 59:08.870
Why are you so crazy?

59:09.078 --> 59:11.569
l'm just saying.
lt'll make you feel better.

59:11.781 --> 59:16.548
-No, it'll make you feel better.
-Yes, yes, it will make me feel better.

59:16.753 --> 59:18.880
Oh, my friend.

59:19.088 --> 59:22.319
-l am so sorry.
-Me too.

59:22.525 --> 59:24.959
Maybe we should snatch Dave too.

59:25.161 --> 59:27.891
Just do a drive-by snatching,
and snatch everybody.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.863
You can do it.

59:44.447 --> 59:46.039
-lt's all right.
-Way to go for it.

59:46.616 --> 59:48.481
Good job, Bryson.

59:48.985 --> 59:52.079
Let me tell you something, Bryson.
You were a beast up in that pool.

59:52.288 --> 59:55.189
-Thanks, coach.
-l can't wait to come to another meet.

59:55.391 --> 59:58.724
Well, l'm here all weekend if l keep
winning. The finals are tomorrow.

59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.623
Hey, Bryson, wait up.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.959
There is a rep here
from the Junior Olympics.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.566
And l want you to meet him.

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:08.367
-Are you serious?
-You're on your way, young man.

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:11.404
Okay, well, go.
We'll be out here waiting for you.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:12.905
Okay.

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.633
Hey, listen, thank you so much...

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:17.312
...for taking the time
to come out here today and--

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.879
l mean, it really means
the world to both of us.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.210
Hey, a deal's a deal, right?

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.378
Hey, Dave?

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.757
Don't take this
the wrong way or anything...

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:32.621
...but we single girls
are experts at a few things.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.491
-Like what?
-Like good men.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:40.165
l was telling Clarice just the other day
about how all the guys like you...

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.828
...are already taken
and that she's a very lucky woman.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.598
Thanks.

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:49.670
Can l ask you a question?

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.678
l saw your college photo
at the house.

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:55.180
What happened
to your baseball career?

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:58.048
Anterior cruciate ligament
happened to my career.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.017
-Oh, man.
-Yeah.

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.122
l was sliding into home plate.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.953
My knee went one way
and my body went the other.

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:08.188
Along with my dreams
of making it into the big leagues.

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:12.198
Well, at least you're passing those
dreams on to those Little Leaguers.

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.427
Yeah, somebody's
got to take care of them.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.867
-And that you do.
-That l do.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.174
And who takes care of you?

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.706
Hello, hello.

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.710
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.577
-What are you doing here?
-l can ask you the same question.

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.309
l was just bringing flowers.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.546
l never brought flowers before
in my entire life, just so you know.

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.724
And they aren't for you,
my married friend.

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:37.586
Yeah, well, l didn't think so.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:41.059
Okay, l think l'm gonna go
check on the boys inside.

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.625
Oh, they're beautiful.

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:48.565
Hey, these flowers don't mean
l'm stalking you.

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.605
No, they're beautiful. Yeah.

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:54.436
-We had a conversation.
-Okey-doke.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:58.878
Okay, that's weird.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:04.182
Clearly l don't have a chance with this
girl, which is deeply baffling to me.

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.581
So seriously, man.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.782
-What are you doing here?
-What am l doing here?

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:13.518
You don't think l see
what's going on here?

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:17.460
You got everything a man could want.
A gorgeous wife, beautiful home.

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.397
And you think that
that makes it all good for me?

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.102
l just don't want to see you
screw up your life.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:27.868
Too late for that.
My life's already screwed up.

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.439
Dave.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.780
Who takes care of me?

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:40.546
-Hey, Dave.
-That's a damn good question.

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:49.631
A question
I didn't have an answer for.

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.798
Hi.

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:03.940
You didn't notice the candles?

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.911
-Reesie, l--
-Come on, baby.

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.279
You remember the candles.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:14.786
When we first got married,
they were always my signal...

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:17.926
...to let you know
l was gonna put something on you.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.188
l know.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:26.830
l know it's been a long time
since l lit my candles for you, l....

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:29.898
You don't have to do this.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:32.700
Baby, we need this.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:37.069
l sent Mama on a long errand,
so she won't be back for a long time.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.113
Come here, please.

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:52.020
Like you said,
it's time for us to get back...

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:54.423
...to the loving part of our marriage.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:58.828
-Oh, baby, l want you so bad.
-Stop.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.380
-Are you sleeping with her?
-What?

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.375
l'm not stupid, David.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:18.520
-Are you sleeping with Julie?
-No, l'm not sleeping with her.

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:21.918
Well, then, what is it? What--?

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:25.218
Since when have you had
to take phone calls outside?

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.896
What are all
the phone calls about, anyway?

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.725
David, what's happening?
Tell me the truth.

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:34.266
Things haven't been right between us
and l think we both know that.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.233
l know that.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.164
So l'm not gonna lie to you.

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:46.171
l do have some feelings for her.

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.785
That's worse.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.286
She's taken your heart from me?

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.461
So, what do you want me to do?

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.596
l don't know, David.

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:28.490
-Clarice.
-How could you, Julie?

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:31.319
-What?
-How could you betray me like this?

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.654
-Betray you, what--?
-l respected you.

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.023
l thought we were friends.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.860
Okay, l gotta stop you right there
if this is what l think it's about.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.593
Dave and l are friends.
Just like you and l are friends.

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.965
Nothing more, nothing less.
We're just friends.

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:47.665
Girl, as much as l would like
to snatch you right now...

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.504
...l'm not gonna do that.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.339
l'm gonna rise above this.

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:55.340
But let me make myself very clear.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:58.179
Stay the hell away
from my husband.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.515
You wanna blame someone
for your problems?

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.885
You didn't need to leave
your doorstep to do it.

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.118
And you certainly don't need
to come to mine.

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.796
Oh, girl.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:11.364
ln case you didn't hear me
the first time...

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:15.867
...stay away from my man.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.318
Yeah.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.784
-Yeah, come on.
-Here we go.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.889
Take your marks.

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:29.674
-Come on.
-Kick, kick, kick.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.617
Go, Bryson!

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.548
Come on, Bryson! Keep pushing!

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:34.609
-Come on, Bryson!
-Go!

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.076
Oh, my God!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.346
Oh, my God!

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.718
Oh, he's done it! Oh, my God!

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.434
Why don't we say it's a draw?

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:15.712
Let me ask you this, man to man.
Ain't nobody in here but me and you.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:22.624
Who gets that baseball scholarship
if we back in the day?

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.386
You do.

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:30.791
But l was a better athlete.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.999
Right.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.666
So you think all the hell
l've been through was my fault.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:40.466
Man, everybody got problems.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.974
See, you just don't know
how good you got it.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.738
You talking about Darius, right?

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:50.817
l'd trade that scholarship and
everything l had for a son like Darius.

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:17.876
Oh, hell, no.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.173
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.610
We putting you out of here.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:24.047
And don't think Clarice
is gonna change her mind.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.686
What you doing, you old woman?

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.413
-Old? Oh, no, hell, no.
-Mama, please!

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.251
No, no, no, let her talk.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.950
She's always had an equal vote.
Why change it now?

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:34.925
What is wrong with you?

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:38.122
You got this beautiful
black queen right here.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:40.234
What in your mind
makes you think...

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.301
...you gotta go out
and get a white woman?

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.062
Shut up
and mind your own business.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.503
-David.
-No.

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:51.044
He been living high on the hog
leeching off your money for years.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.579
lt's time you got his black ass
out of here.

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:56.148
She more of a man
than you'll ever be.

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.748
So you just gonna stand there
and let her say that to me?

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.351
Clarice.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:07.791
You are just gonna stand there
and let her say that to me?

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:14.360
Well, then you're right.
lt is time for me to get out of here.

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:16.731
Because l don't give
a damn about this house...

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:20.204
...your money or this marriage.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:21.665
l'm done.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.310
Dave.

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:25.836
Hey, where you been?

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:28.915
l've been trying to call your cell.
There was an accident.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.449
-lt's Bryson.
-What happened?

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.678
l don't know,
he went into the wall too hard.

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:36.517
They rushed him to the hospital.
lt's bad, man, really bad.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.588
Come on, l'll drive.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.527
-l should go.
-You ain't going nowhere.

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.667
Go on in the house.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.239
Coach.

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.011
Please, what are you doing?

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:03.980
No, no, no. Please, no.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.746
No, no.

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:10.084
Oh, please, God.

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.582
She's all alone.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:46.892
l don't think she has anyone
to help her through this.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.759
She has us.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:02.768
''The Lord is my shepherd.
l shall not want.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:06.007
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.945
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.449
He restoreth my soul.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:17.190
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:20.021
Though l walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:24.222
...l will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:28.164
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:32.236
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.706
Thou anointest my head with oil.''

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.183
''My cup runneth over.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:32.697
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:38.806
And l will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.'' Amen.

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:27.683
Clarice, be honest with me.

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:32.851
ln the last meeting
l had with you and Dave...

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:35.359
...l asked you
a very important question.

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.762
Yeah.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:43.627
Has God been
the third strand in that cord...

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:47.832
...l wrapped around
your shoulders all those years ago?

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:50.976
No.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.847
Well, without that third strand...

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.847
...you find yourself
sitting here alone.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.829
Your mother is a good woman.

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:15.235
But because you listened to her
in matters of your marriage...

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:21.006
...that acorn hasn't fallen
too far from the tree.

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:25.808
Now, l got to go bury this child.

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.250
But, Clarice...

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:36.881
...you're in the right place
at the right time.

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:53.197
When I drive through this city...

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:56.468
...and hear the sounds of sirens
and alarms going off...

01:16:56.678 --> 01:17:00.614
...I see the looks of panic
on the faces of people I don't know.

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:04.677
I realize how afraid we all are
in this world.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:10.255
Life is so unpredictable, fragile.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:14.987
We're only alive one breath,
one heartbeat at a time.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:37.680
And so when death comes
to one of us...

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.945
...it comes to all of us.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.522
Because it's the one thing
we all have in common.

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:48.788
Sooner or later,
it's the one place we're all headed.

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.714
And even though
some of us believe...

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:17.688
...that life doesn't end
on this side of the grave...

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:23.058
...our grief drives us to hunger
for a human touch.

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.417
Mama, what's that?

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:46.587
ls that a picture of Daddy?
Let me see that.

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.483
Give it here.

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.350
-So you still love him?
-No.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.496
That's a piece of him
l keep as a reminder...

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:58.029
...that l made the right decision.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.701
Do you miss him at all?

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:09.377
Do you remember that
cheerleading competition l won?

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.036
l remember all your accomplishments,
Clarice. What you want?

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:16.376
That was the same weekend
Daddy left.

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:19.519
But all l remember you saying--

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:24.385
Don't start dredging up all that mess.
That's good riddance to bad rubbish.

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:29.760
All l remember you ever saying to me
was how he cheated on you...

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:32.559
...and how he was
a horrible husband.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.565
Never really got his side.

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:39.797
Finally talked to Daddy, and he said
that he never slept with that woman.

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.033
He said you drove him
out of the house, Mama.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:44.007
He didn't sleep with her until after--

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:46.840
-l'm not having this conversation.
-Why?

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.347
Because my bedroom drama with your
daddy ain't none of your business.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:52.383
Excuse me?

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:55.718
The way you're all up in my marriage?

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:58.984
You convinced me
to put my husband out of my house.

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:01.185
l think it is my business, Mama.

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:03.296
Don't talk to me like that.

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:06.527
Okay, all right.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.873
You wanna know?

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.597
Yes.

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.943
Your daddy was rotten.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:22.978
You were too young to understand
what was going on in that house.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:27.816
He was a nasty bastard.

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.617
-Mama--
-Don't ''Mama'' me.

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:36.494
He hit me...

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.232
...in my face.

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:48.470
Now, you listen to me real good.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:54.806
When they stay,
and they done already left...

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.716
...they get mean.

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.420
l hated your daddy.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.024
-Mama.
-No, l hated him.

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.694
l hated him!

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:11.596
You were right to throw Dave's ass
out of here before he hits you.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.429
No. No, David's not like that.

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:18.704
And that wasn't the way
to handle that.

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:20.568
l shouldn't have listened to you.

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:26.137
l shouldn't have listened to you.

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:28.646
l'm not gonna talk about this.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.442
l'm not.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:37.524
Black women have to be strong
and you know that.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.318
l don't know what kind of pain...

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.654
...you are holding on to
in your heart, Mama...

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:45.629
...but you need to let it go.
You need to just let it go.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:50.530
And in all your lessons about
how l need to be strong...

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.730
...and proud
and independent, Mama...

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:55.239
...you left out
some very important things.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:59.174
-What?
-How to love, Mama.

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:05.385
How to really care about somebody.
How to forgive.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.082
l cared about you.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:13.993
l loved you the best l could.

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:20.498
l gave you everything in me
that he didn't take.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.171
And he took everything.

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.977
Can't you see that?

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:32.305
l know you did, Mama.

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:40.079
And if that ain't good enough for you,
then l'm sorry for you.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:41.880
No.

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:45.823
Mama, l'm so sorry for you.

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:52.496
l didn't mean to come out here
and disrespect you, l really didn't.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.605
But it's time for me to grow up...

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:02.072
...and l'm gonna have to ask you
to leave my house...

01:23:02.277 --> 01:23:04.268
...because l want my husband.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:09.282
l want my husband back,
and l want to fight for my marriage.

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:13.284
Because, Mama,
l don't want to end up like you.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:14.921
l don't.

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:20.623
l'm gonna pray for you, Mama.

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:26.066
l love you so much.

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.398
Little girl.

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.845
You pray for yourself.

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:43.147
l'll be gone when you get back.

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.380
Go on.

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:49.380
Okay.

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.650
Okay.

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:06.607
I'm not sorry about what we did.
I love you.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.469
-Please leave.
-Not until we talk.

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:11.941
We can't.
If Shawn comes up here and....

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.581
-He can never find out about this.
-He won't.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.248
Then why are you even doing this?

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:21.047
Hey, hey!
Hey, come on, Dave, knock.

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.190
-You scared me.
-What are you doing here?

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:25.518
What do you mean?
Why didn't you knock?

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:26.785
l just came by.

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:31.091
Talked to the manager. l told him l was
your probation officer, he let me up.

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:34.234
-So, what are you doing here?
-l can't come by to see my friend?

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:35.926
l know what you're going through.

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:39.300
l wanna make sure that everything
that you are going through is cool.

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:42.067
-Make sure you're copasetic.
-What are you watching?

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.302
Just something to
make me feel better. l had--

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.377
Vanessa kicked your ass out,
didn't she?

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:51.018
First of all, that's just crazy to even
think that she would kick me out.

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:53.380
Okay, why would she kick
her husband out?

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.613
Her husband,
the man she's supposed to love.

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:58.793
Can l tell you what she said to me?
Can l tell you what she said?

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.927
-Listen, look at me.
-What did she say?

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.756
She told me l'm too emotional.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.033
l'm way too in touch
with my feminine side.

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:09.294
No man should apologize
to nobody that much.

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.495
My feet, she don't like my feet now.

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:13.435
All of a sudden
my feet is a problem?

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.074
But her back, l can accept that?

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.870
-You can't accept my feet?
-Here's what l want you to do.

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.410
Go back home to your wife.

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:21.479
No, l'm gonna make her think
l'm cheating.

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:23.776
You need to go back home
to your wife.

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:26.010
-Why don't you--?
-Go back home to your wife.

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:29.190
Can you talk to me? Listen,
can you talk to me for two seconds?

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:33.690
Why can't me and you get in touch,
figure out why this keep happening?

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.362
-l'm emotional now.
-Good men.

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:37.394
-Good brothers.
-Emotional, here we go.

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:38.588
We're good black men.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.358
-Got my toiletry bag?
-Here you go.

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:42.297
-Because l don't want to--
-Here we go.

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:44.131
l love you, l don't tell you enough.

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:46.307
-Here we go.
-All right, you right.

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.203
-Thank you, Dave.
-Have a good night.

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.775
Do you got my toiletry bag? Okay.

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:20.597
Hello.

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:53.801
Thank you for coming.

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:58.104
And thank you
for taking care of everything. l--

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.846
l couldn't have done it.

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:04.515
Are you okay?

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:10.755
l think he was so focused
on winning and that medal, he....

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:13.958
His coach told him about--

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:17.088
Why didn't l remind him?

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:26.429
''You have to take the trash out
when we get home.''

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.232
What?

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:33.813
That's the last thing l said to him.
Before the race.

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:38.452
''You have to take the trash out
when we get home.''

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:42.389
Not ''l love you.''

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:46.756
Not ''l'm so proud of you.''

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:49.119
Not ''l'm so lucky to be your mom.''

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.628
''You've got to take the trash out
when we get home.''

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:54.301
-lt's okay.
-No, it is not gonna be okay.

01:27:57.205 --> 01:28:00.902
lt's-- lt's never gonna be okay.

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.275
Oh, my God. lt's just not gonna be.

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:09.882
-lt's all right.
-You can't make it better.

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:14.347
Just stop.

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:18.417
lt's not. lt never is.

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:45.150
Wait, no, wait.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.481
l can't do this.

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:57.991
l know.

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.899
l'm sorry.

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.070
l know.

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:42.140
Now, you tell the crew for me
there are four ways...

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:43.935
...of doing things onboard my ship:

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:46.875
The right way, the wrong way,
the Navy way, and my way.

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.882
If they do things my way,
we'll get along.

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:51.745
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Okay.

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:56.824
Oh, the manager gave me a key.

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:59.788
-l can leave if you--
-No, no, no, it's cool.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:03.689
That manager
would give a key to anybody.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:13.937
David, l just need you
to let me say some things, okay?

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:19.674
l have been round
and round with my heart...

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.745
...and l want you to know two things.

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:25.544
First of all, Mama has lost...

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:28.119
...all of her voting privileges
in this marriage.

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.187
And, second...

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:38.261
...no one ever taught me
how to be one of those wives...

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:41.663
...who holds on
to her man's every word.

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:46.738
And no one taught me how to trust him
to take care of me, you know?

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:51.901
l really don't know
if l could ever be that woman...

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.242
...but l do want to learn
how to be your partner.

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:01.549
And whatever you decide...

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:06.356
...l need you to know
that l can't live without you, David.

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:10.429
l don't want to live without you
and l love you so much.

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:15.701
Come here.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:19.830
What's that?

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.208
l heated you up a plate...

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:28.314
...because you're staying in
a roach motel and l wanted you to eat.

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.647
-l cooked it.
-You cooked it?

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:33.821
-Yes.
-There ain't poison in this, is there?

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:40.519
You're not gonna eat it?

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:42.958
You're not gonna eat the food?

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:49.032
Hi.

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:32.611
What up?

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.276
What up?

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.384
You know, l was hoping, man...

01:32:39.587 --> 01:32:42.351
...l can get Darius
back on your team, you know?

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:51.958
lt's like you, you know--
You helping him to be a better man.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.843
Why don't we both do that?

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.992
Darius, where you at?

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:32.671
Okay. Listen,
l got you back on the team, man.

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:37.841
Yeah, and l got you a new glove.

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:43.984
So l want you to come back home
and be there by, like, 5:00.

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:47.583
And....

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:52.390
l love you, man. You know?

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:56.794
Yeah.

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:01.433
All right.

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:09.499
I found out that if you wanna know
the purpose of a thing...

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:12.474
...you can't ask the thing to tell you.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.046
A car doesn't know why it's a car.

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:18.741
Only the manufacturer knows
what it was made to do.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:23.318
And I guess that's the way it is
with us and God.

01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:25.487
You know...

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:31.855
...you'd make
an excellent daddy someday.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.497
Well, l hope so.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.776
What about in, like,
seven and a half months?

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.240
Are you saying that...?

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:14.701
God didn't just make Dave Johnson
to be a husband...

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:19.972
...or a coach, a friend, or a daddy.

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:24.980
Those are just roles,
not who I am as a man.

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.317
But I guess, sometimes...

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:36.690
...he has to let life
turn you upside-down...

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:45.898
...so you can learn how to live
right side up.
