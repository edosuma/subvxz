Zanone brothers.

03:00.113 --> 03:03.116
This fuckin'
series, huh?

03:03.116 --> 03:05.118
Your driver,

03:05.618 --> 03:08.621

all over the place!

03:08.621 --> 03:09.622
He did, huh?

03:09.622 --> 03:11.624
What "he did"?

03:15.128 --> 03:18.131
The goddamn,
goddamn garbage.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.633
We thought you
wanted it back.

03:20.633 --> 03:21.634
What?

03:21.634 --> 03:23.636
What?

03:23.636 --> 03:24.637
The raghead
from the deli.

03:24.637 --> 03:27.140
Hello,
where are you?

03:27.640 --> 03:30.643
You called yesterday
to complain?

03:30.643 --> 03:33.146
That's our policy,
it's written on our trucks.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.148
Double your garbage back
if you're not satisfied.

03:35.648 --> 03:43.156
I complain because you
didn't make full pickups
on 12, 16, 20th.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.658
And then i get
charged double for it!

03:45.658 --> 03:48.161
Right, we had to
come out twice.

03:48.161 --> 03:52.665
You charge me double
for pickups you miss?

03:52.665 --> 03:55.668
My dispatcher asked you
if you're not satisfied

03:55.668 --> 03:58.171
did you want
your garbage back?

03:58.171 --> 04:00.173
Of course i don't
want garbage back.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.675
Then you're satisfied.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.678
You are speaking
shit to me.

04:05.678 --> 04:10.183
We'll try to send
a truck out tomorrow.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.690
What are we talking,
eight to ten?

04:17.690 --> 04:24.697
For godsake alan, i can plea
him out of three to five.

04:24.697 --> 04:28.701
Alright, talk to mike gendler,
see what he says.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.703
What's all this?

04:30.703 --> 04:35.208
You looked thirsty
last time i saw you.

04:35.708 --> 04:41.714
Oh yeah, you know what?
I knew i left this someplace.

04:41.714 --> 04:42.715
New?

04:42.715 --> 04:44.217
Ah you know,
keeping busy.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.219
Carmela, the kids?

04:46.219 --> 04:47.220
Good.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.221
You know,
school shit.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.223
You bet that
game last night?

04:50.223 --> 04:51.224
Yeah.

04:51.224 --> 04:55.228
What do you think
i need this for?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.731
So what do i
owe you, counselor?

04:58.731 --> 05:01.234
You'll pay me when i actually
have to do something.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.236
Let's hope that fuckin' day
never comes, right?

05:03.236 --> 05:05.238
It almost did
very recently.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.741
Here we go, the neil mink
lecture series.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.744
We'll isn't it fair to say
we were staring into the abyss?

05:11.744 --> 05:14.247
A very close call, that brush
with a murder beef.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.250
I told you
i was home alone.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.252
You and macaulay culkin.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.755
Except that neither one
of you would have been alone.

05:24.757 --> 05:25.758
Champagne's nice.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.760
But you want
to give me a real gift?

05:27.760 --> 05:30.763
Insulate yourself
from these shenanigans.

05:30.763 --> 05:31.764
I told you
once already.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.266
I do.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.267
I am.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.268
What the fuck
you want from me?

05:35.768 --> 05:37.770
Use one of the businesses
we've got you in,

05:37.770 --> 05:40.773
for something besides
showing income on a tax return.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.276
Spend time
at garden state rendering.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.779
Oh please, you know what
boiling fat smells like?

05:46.779 --> 05:49.282
You have an office
at barone sanitation.

05:49.282 --> 05:53.286
Get your ass out of that
strip club and go there.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.788
Alright, i hear you.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.790
The feds are
a business, anthony.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.793
Millions of tax dollars
invested in watching your ass.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.796
Sooner or late
r just like you,

06:03.796 --> 06:06.799
they're gonna want a return
on that investment.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.303
Mother of fucking mercy.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.805
What'd you take
a sledge hammer to my balls?

06:12.805 --> 06:15.808
That's just the incision
where i inserted the stent.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.810
You're gonna feel
a little tenderness.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.312
Okay, almost there.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.313
Easy.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.316
You should use
the bedpan next time.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.318
I'm not a cat.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.319
I don't shit in a box.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.321
You have to watch
your heart.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.822
My heart's fine.

06:29.822 --> 06:32.825
When i get out of here
we're going to a discotheque,

06:32.825 --> 06:33.826
you and me.

06:33.826 --> 06:37.830
Discotheque.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.834
What's so funny?

06:41.834 --> 06:42.835
Mr. Soprano.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.837
I'm michael mcluhan from
the u. S. Marshall service.

06:45.338 --> 06:49.842
Here to reattach
your electronic bracelet.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.844
They you give you
the important jobs, huh?

06:51.844 --> 06:54.347
Excuse me.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.848
Your name's really
mcluhan?

06:55.848 --> 06:56.849
Right.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.353
So that makes you
marshal mcluhan.

07:00.353 --> 07:04.357
That's right.

07:04.357 --> 07:04.857
What?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.859
What's the fucking joke?

07:07.360 --> 07:11.364
Alright, you may feel
pressure in your chest.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.866
That'll go away
as the blood flow
to heart increases.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.369
Just stay in bed,
plenty of fluids.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.371
Get you home tomorrow.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.874
Lucky fucking me.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.381
Sandwich
or something?

07:28.381 --> 07:31.384
Did you hear me with my balls,
who can fucking eat?

07:43.396 --> 07:47.900
...new york's only
classic rock station, q104.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.412
What are you
looking at?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.414
Nothing.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.417
Just looking
out the window.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.919
Gettin'
my eyebrows done.

09:10.983 --> 09:11.984
Remember...

09:11.984 --> 09:14.487
one mouth, two ears.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.990
Listen
to each other.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.993
I'll see you next week.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.996
Okay.

10:22.555 --> 10:28.060
So, what's up?

10:28.060 --> 10:31.564
I don't know,
i'm...

10:31.564 --> 10:33.566
i'm bored
or something.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.068
I don't want
to come here no more.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.571
Well...

10:38.571 --> 10:44.076
not the first time
we've heard you say that.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.583
No offense
but let's face it,

10:50.583 --> 10:52.585
this is starting to feel
like a waste of time.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.586
I'm sure for
the both of us.

10:54.086 --> 11:01.594
I don't feel that way.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.596
Like the other day
i'm watching this movie

11:03.596 --> 11:08.601
with brad pitt and
that blonde, gweneth paltrow.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.102
"Sliding doors"?

11:10.102 --> 11:11.604
Fuck no,"seven".

11:12.104 --> 11:15.107
It's a good movie,
and i never seen it before.

11:15.107 --> 11:20.112
But halfway through it,
i'm thinking, this is bullshit.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.615
A waste of my fucking time.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.617
Why do i give a shit
who the killer is?

11:25.117 --> 11:28.120
What difference
is that information
gonna make in my life?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.122
Very true.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.624
So i shut it off.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.626
Good for you.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.629
What did you
do instead?

11:36.629 --> 11:43.135
I went out in the yard
and burned ants
with a magnifying glass.

11:43.135 --> 11:49.642
A little sense
of humor here.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.143
What's the matter?

11:51.143 --> 11:53.646
You still in mourning over
the coming of managed care?

11:54.146 --> 11:56.148
Go on.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.149
What's the point?

11:57.650 --> 12:00.152
You go to italy,
you lift some weights,

12:00.152 --> 12:01.153
you watch a movie.

12:01.654 --> 12:05.157
It's all a series of
distractions'til you die.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.159
I hear
depression talking.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.662
Yeah well, i'm not
up on my dosage.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.664
Medication
, medication,

12:11.664 --> 12:13.165
medication, what do i
got to show for it?

12:13.666 --> 12:15.668
Who knows where you'd be
without the medication?

12:15.668 --> 12:23.175
Anyway, some people take
pleasure in the simple
doing of things.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.178
Yeah well, the things i
take pleasure in, i can't do.

12:26.679 --> 12:31.684
Currently trying
to change my business profile,

12:31.684 --> 12:33.185
if you kno
w what i mean.

12:33.185 --> 12:37.189
So it's all about
your legal problems.

12:59.712 --> 13:00.713
I'm gonna
get the car.

13:01.213 --> 13:02.715
Don't disappear,
meet me out front.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.217
Corrado?

13:05.217 --> 13:07.720
I thought that was you.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.222
Catherine...
romano.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.225
Catherine.

13:13.225 --> 13:16.729
Mr. Soprano, you have
to stay in a wheelchair
until you leave the building.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.230
Hospital rules.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.231
So call a cop.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.734
A little procedure,

13:21.734 --> 13:23.736
you'd think that they'd
worry about the sick people.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.738
It's all about
the insurance.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.740
You remember my chuckie?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.742
Little chuckie,

13:29.742 --> 13:33.746
you drove the bike
for the butchers.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.248
I got to call karen, ma.

13:36.248 --> 13:40.252
He's a cop now
, like his father.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.253
A detective.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.255
He's a good egg, your lou,

13:43.255 --> 13:48.761
a real straight shooter,
he had a lot of class.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.262
Hodgkin's, no?

13:50.262 --> 13:51.764
It's been
almost 15 years.

13:52.264 --> 13:53.265
That long?

13:53.766 --> 13:57.770
The week
the shuttle exploded.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.272
The pension helps.

14:00.272 --> 14:01.273
The grandchildren.

14:01.273 --> 14:04.276
You look good, corrado.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.277
You healthy?

14:05.277 --> 14:07.279
A little heart trouble,
nothing much.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.283
You broke your ankle?

14:11.283 --> 14:16.288
Bunions.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.791
You still
in belleville?

14:18.791 --> 14:21.794
Same house,
watsessing avenue.

14:21.794 --> 14:25.798
I'm right on ampere parkwa
y near our beloved alma mater.

14:25.798 --> 14:29.301
Maybe we could
have coffee.

14:29.301 --> 14:30.302
Catch up.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.304
There's an ihop
by the dry cleaners.

14:32.304 --> 14:36.308
The doctor says i'm not
supposed to leave the house.

14:36.308 --> 14:42.314
Too much stress.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.315
Sir.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.318
The chair.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.854

show up for eight years,

15:21.854 --> 15:23.856

my office into a storeroom?

15:23.856 --> 15:27.860
No, i'm gonna get

15:36.869 --> 15:38.370
Connie desapio.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.873
What happened
to diane?

15:41.373 --> 15:44.376
A little self indulgent when
it came to office supplies.

15:44.376 --> 15:47.379
Connie, mr. Soprano's
been out the in field,

15:47.379 --> 15:49.882

15:52.885 --> 15:55.387
And let's move these
boxes out, the books.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.388
What should

15:56.388 --> 15:58.891
I don't know,

15:58.891 --> 16:01.894
I'll put them

Nice rack.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.402

16:12.404 --> 16:15.407
Listen, while
i have you here,

16:15.908 --> 16:16.909

16:16.909 --> 16:17.910
Richie aprile.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.912
Yeah i know,

16:19.912 --> 16:21.413
He tipped a truck
at a deli in nutley.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.414
That fucking guy.

16:22.915 --> 16:23.916
But that's not it.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.919
One of zanone's drivers,
the illustrated man.

16:27.419 --> 16:29.922
Richie's got him
running an operation,

16:29.922 --> 16:31.924
selling blow
along the routes.

16:31.924 --> 16:35.427
Now the department of sanitation
i can handle, tony.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.931
But if the d. E. A. Gets involved
we're gonna lose our 901.

16:38.931 --> 16:42.935
Sonofa- fuckin'- bitch.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.938
I'm sorry, i don't like
to break your balls.

16:45.938 --> 16:49.942
You know that piece of shit's
gonna be my brother in law?

16:49.942 --> 16:52.945
Nice, huh?

16:52.945 --> 16:54.446
The rico act, elliot.

16:54.446 --> 16:58.450
We sat there and we talked
about the fucking rico act.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.954
You treat
different patients.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.455
Your base
of knowledge expands.

17:04.455 --> 17:08.961
Two years ago i thought
rico was a relative of his.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.473
Cards- on- the- table time.

17:22.473 --> 17:23.976
How's the drinking?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.978
I don't know.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.480
Worse, i guess.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.984
Are you an alcoholic?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.993
I am drinking
in between sessions.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.996
That's very serious.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.998
Just on the days
that i see him.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.001
I can't take it.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.503
Finally, thank you.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.007
Are you taking steps
to seriously end it?

17:55.007 --> 17:57.509
He wanted to end it.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.012
He said last time
he wanted to stop coming.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.513
But i talked
him out of it.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.015
Why?

18:03.015 --> 18:06.018
If i was at sloan and
he had a pituitary tumor,

18:06.018 --> 18:13.025
would i stop
him from coming?

18:13.025 --> 18:16.528
Elliot, it's like that thing
with watching a train wreck.

18:16.528 --> 18:21.533
I'm afraid and repulsed
by what he might tell me.

18:21.533 --> 18:26.538
But somehow i can't stop myself
from wanting to hear it.

18:35.547 --> 18:41.553
Okay.

18:41.553 --> 18:42.554
All set.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.557
It'll ramp up
to eight pounds per cubic inch.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.559
Keep your airway open
when you're sleeping.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.561
I don't snore.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.063
Ah, don't be embarrassed.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.065
Obstructive sleep apnea
is serious.

18:53.065 --> 18:56.068
Every time your airway
closes down and you wake up
fighting for breath,

18:56.568 --> 18:59.071
it puts tremendous strain
on your heart.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.573
Dr. Schreck is absolutely right
in prescribing this for you.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.575
Makes me look
like a sick man.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.077
You're not sick.

19:05.577 --> 19:09.081
But testing shows rem- wise,
you have 40 arousals per hour.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.084
More since i met you.

19:12.084 --> 19:16.088
Such a thing to say.

19:16.088 --> 19:21.093
Arousals mean a change
in your stages in your sleep.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.595
You are such a flirt.

19:23.595 --> 19:27.099
I'll stop by tomorrow okay?
See how you did.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.600
Be counting the beats.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.104
Who's that?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.106
Judge crater,
how should i know?

19:34.106 --> 19:35.607
The one who ordere
d the house arrest?

19:36.108 --> 19:38.110
Answer the door,
it's a goddamn expression.

19:38.110 --> 19:45.117
I'm gonna go
wash my hands.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.619
Hello, i'm catherine,
a friend of corrado's.

19:47.619 --> 19:55.127
Fuck me.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.629
Oh catherine,
what a surprise.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.132
I would've called,
you're unlisted.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.634
I brought manicott'.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.137
How's your foot?

20:05.137 --> 20:06.638
It's better, thanks.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.640
Heart?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.143
Better.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.146
Is this a bad time
for a visit?

20:14.146 --> 20:16.148
Actually, the nurse
just got here.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.650
We were about to
have my examination.

20:18.650 --> 20:22.654
Oh well,
maybe friday then.

20:23.155 --> 20:29.661
I volunteer at the bingo
since louis past.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.662
Well...

20:30.662 --> 20:33.165
enjoy the manicott'.

20:33.665 --> 20:38.170
Thank you,
i will.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.172
You're awful.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.675
Neighbor lady,
she went to school
with my older brother.

20:43.675 --> 20:48.180
I'll see ya tomorrow.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.190
What did you send
that lady away for?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.691
I thought you were bored.

20:59.691 --> 21:00.692
Talking to that
dreadnought would help?

21:01.193 --> 21:03.195
She seems alright.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.197
What the hell would
we have in common?

21:05.197 --> 21:11.703
Bunion, you know how
i feel about feet.

21:19.711 --> 21:21.213
Look at this.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.714
You believe this one
with the cleavage?

21:22.714 --> 21:25.217
Finger food is better
than last year.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.220
It's not the landfill,
the problem is the limit.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.722
Right know we're
at two grand a day,

21:30.722 --> 21:33.725
but with dos breaking our ball
i got to fuck with ins and outs.

21:33.725 --> 21:36.228
Oh yeah, what's that?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.730
The paperwork,
you know?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.232
List the gross tonnage.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.234
I got to file it
in triplicate every day.

21:42.234 --> 21:47.739
Right.

21:47.739 --> 21:48.740
How ya doing?

21:48.740 --> 21:50.742
Is that your wife,
dickie?

21:51.243 --> 21:53.245
Yeah, c'mon,
i'll introduce you.

21:53.745 --> 21:57.249
I'm getting
engaged myself.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.750
Hey some place, huh?

21:58.750 --> 22:00.752
That landscaping
is gorgeous.

22:00.752 --> 22:04.256
Janice, you're
completely transformed.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.757
What can i say?

22:05.757 --> 22:08.260
You look good, janice.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.262
You look
pretty good, janice.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.764
You are a giant asshole,
you know?

22:12.764 --> 22:14.266
C'mon.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.267
...nirvana.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.770
You got a minute?

22:18.770 --> 22:21.773
Jesus christ,
let me get a drink.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.275
Naw, we'll grab
a waiter, c'mon.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.777
I'll see you.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.279
Excuse me ladies.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.780
Have you met
helen barone?

22:29.281 --> 22:30.282
Hi, jan soprano.

22:30.782 --> 22:31.783
Nice to meet you.

22:31.783 --> 22:35.287
Nice to meet you.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.290
Got any blow?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.291
What?

22:39.291 --> 22:40.792
Blow, you know coke.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.795
What, you don't
keep it on you?

22:43.795 --> 22:45.297
I got to go
to the deli in nutley?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.798
Tony.

22:46.798 --> 22:47.799
You don't sell that shit
along those routes,

22:47.799 --> 22:48.800
you understand me?

22:48.800 --> 22:49.801
I'm working
with junior on this.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.803
I don't give a shit
if you're working with walmart,

22:51.803 --> 22:52.804
knock it the fuck off.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.307
Trying to earn here,
we're saving for a house.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.309
You got enough in your plate
just picking up garbage.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.811
Not if you and
that fucking association,

22:59.811 --> 23:01.813
and that cocksucker barone
don't let me expand.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.316
Are you fucking
stoonad or what?

23:04.316 --> 23:05.817
After five years.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.819
The cops are finally
leaving garbage alone.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.322
A drug bust on one of
those routes is different story,

23:10.322 --> 23:12.824
you got the fbi, the d. E. A. ,
those fucking pricks

23:12.824 --> 23:14.826
are gonna be breathing
down our necks again.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.828
It's only coke.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.830
What is the big deal?

23:18.830 --> 23:19.831
You and my uncle,

23:20.332 --> 23:22.334
you want to deal drugs,
that's your business.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.337
You do it on
association garbage routes,
it's my fucking business.

23:25.837 --> 23:30.842
It stops today,
you got it?

23:30.842 --> 23:32.344
Don't give me your
fucking manson lamps,

23:32.344 --> 23:33.845
just fucking stop.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.848
Another thing, don't tip
a truck on a problem customer.

23:37.349 --> 23:41.353
I fucking hate the way
you make me fucking ride you.

23:41.353 --> 23:44.856
Now get the fuck
out of here.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.381
...municipality
went private,

24:09.881 --> 24:11.383
so now we're
bidding on a landfill
down in west virginia.

24:11.383 --> 24:14.386
I started reading
the epa's new guidelines,

24:14.386 --> 24:15.887
on curbside recycling.

24:15.887 --> 24:18.390
I'm telling you,
listen, i'm telling you.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.391
Just liste
n to me, guys.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.893
I got it right through
the transfer station.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.896
And listen to this, it
scaled out at nearly 3, 000 tons.

24:24.896 --> 24:29.401
3, 000 tons.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.403
...talking about instituting
a yard waste ban,

24:31.403 --> 24:36.408
in half the states
on the eastern seaboard.

24:47.919 --> 24:48.920
Oh.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.922
Oh my god, tony.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.424
Call an ambulance.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.926
Jesus christ.

24:55.427 --> 24:55.927
Turn him over,
carmela.

24:55.927 --> 24:56.928
Tony.

24:57.429 --> 25:01.933
Watch his head
, watch his head.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.935
The pills,
the analysis.

25:03.935 --> 25:06.438
You pay her a fortune,
what is she doing for you?

25:06.938 --> 25:07.939
Will you leave me
the fuck alone?

25:07.939 --> 25:09.441
If it was a man
you'd ring his neck.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.444
I got a fucking rash now,
last a week or two.

25:12.444 --> 25:13.945
Leave me alone.

25:13.945 --> 25:14.946
Putting a wing
on her house.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.449
Mr. Soprano.

25:17.949 --> 25:19.951
I have your results.

25:19.951 --> 25:21.453
Yeah.

25:21.453 --> 25:23.455
Just preliminary, but as far
as i can tell, it's...

25:23.455 --> 25:24.956
nothing physical, right?

25:24.956 --> 25:28.460
For chrissake,
i just passed out,
if it's nothing physical,

25:28.460 --> 25:29.961
then what the fuck
is wrong with me?

25:29.961 --> 25:32.464
I would think
you'd be relieved.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.466
I'll be relieved when
somebody puts their finger on

25:34.466 --> 25:36.468
whatever the fuck it is
that's wrong with me.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.970
I wish it was physical,
so i can have it
ripped the fuck out.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.973
I'm sorry, it's just
very frustrating,

25:42.474 --> 25:43.475
i know you're only
trying to help.

25:43.475 --> 25:48.980
You know, losing
some weight wouldn't hurt.

25:57.989 --> 25:58.990
Shit.

26:20.011 --> 26:21.513
Did you get
the lady fingers?

26:21.513 --> 26:23.014
Nah, they were out.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.016
I got crumbcake,
the entenmann's.

26:25.016 --> 26:29.521
Disposal again?
Leave it,

26:30.021 --> 26:32.023
i told you, i gotta
get the flange.

26:32.023 --> 26:33.024
When, st. Smithen's day?

26:33.024 --> 26:36.528
Who was at
the door before?

26:36.528 --> 26:38.530
That lady from
the other day.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.532
Catherine?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.033
The one with
the manicott'.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.535
I said you
were sleeping.

26:43.535 --> 26:48.039
Why didn't
you wake me?

26:48.540 --> 26:51.543
Roberta sanfilippo
didn't call back, did she?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.545
I got to be honest,
junior,

26:54.045 --> 26:56.047
when i ran into her at
fountains of wayne that time,

26:56.548 --> 27:01.052
she was very cold.

27:01.052 --> 27:02.554
What was she buying?

27:02.554 --> 27:06.057
Fountain,
kid pissing.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.559
Must've bought a house.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.061
Great ass.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.063
Jesus.

27:12.063 --> 27:14.566
Talk too much, but
what a piece she was.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.068
And game as they come.

27:17.068 --> 27:21.072
Listen, i'm gonna go.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.575
Got to take
my kid to karate.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.584
No i read it, i did.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.586
That's it,
that's the way of life.

27:34.586 --> 27:37.088
But in "angela's ashes" you
were laughing with him at least.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.592
Every paycheck
squandered on alcohol.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.594
Please, you know
the irish and their liquor.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.597
The "weakness"
he calls it, right?

27:46.097 --> 27:49.100
How he can make such
heartache funny is beyond me.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.102
My god,
with that father?

27:51.102 --> 27:53.104
It's true, we don't know
what poverty is in this country.

27:53.104 --> 27:55.607
Did you feel in this one
the mother came off
a little nicer?

27:55.607 --> 27:57.108
It's all
in the writing.

27:57.108 --> 27:59.110
It's like he makes
certain choices about

27:59.611 --> 28:01.112
how he is going
to portray people.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.114
Like the nuns
in that convent.

28:03.114 --> 28:05.116
Please, catholic school here
wasn't any better.

28:05.116 --> 28:06.618
He used to be
a school teacher, you know.

28:06.618 --> 28:07.619
Some school
in manhattan.

28:08.119 --> 28:12.123
My god, the way
he treated that wife.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.627
She'd be better off
if he beat her.

28:20.131 --> 28:20.632
Hello.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.133
Yeah t, it's me.

28:22.634 --> 28:23.134
Hey.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.637
Listen, that
container came in.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.139
From the other side.

28:28.139 --> 28:31.142
Supposed to
go to that guy...

28:31.142 --> 28:33.144
great,
about fucking time.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.647
It's better than she said,
it's un- fuckin'- believable.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.149
It's all original
world war ii shit.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.151
You're fucking
kidding me.

28:40.151 --> 28:41.152
I know nothing!

28:41.152 --> 28:42.654
Nothing!

28:42.654 --> 28:47.158
I'm looking at the fucking
history channel here.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.660
You got to
come down here.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.161
You'll love this stuff.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.163
Nah.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.666
We got eisenhower's
dinnerware

28:54.666 --> 28:56.668
from allied headquarters
in london.

28:57.168 --> 29:01.172
We got a couple
of herman goerings personal
pearl handled lugers,

29:01.673 --> 29:03.174
and get this...

29:03.174 --> 29:06.177
we got the jeep that patto
n drove around in, in sicily.

29:06.177 --> 29:09.180
We have ways of dealing
with you mr. Soprano!

29:09.180 --> 29:11.182
Aaaah!

29:11.182 --> 29:12.684
Put that thing down.

29:12.684 --> 29:13.685
Put that down,
it's expensive.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.186
No, i better
listen to the lawyer.

29:15.186 --> 29:16.187
Are you sure?

29:16.688 --> 29:17.689
Yeah.

29:18.189 --> 29:19.190
You guys go ahead
without me.

29:19.190 --> 29:22.193
Alright,
talk to you later.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.695
Alright.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.197
How'bout a mystery?

29:26.197 --> 29:28.199
The mystery
is that rosalie read...

29:32.203 --> 29:33.705
what? I liked it.

29:34.205 --> 29:37.208
What about something like
"cider house rules"?

29:37.208 --> 29:39.711
Yeah, but not so sad.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.721
So, how's that
english class going?

29:49.721 --> 29:52.724
Comparative literature,
whatever.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.726
Comp lit
was last semester.

29:54.726 --> 29:59.731
I told you i'm taking lacan,
deconstructive theory.

29:59.731 --> 30:04.235
Ooh, deconstructivist,
excuse me.

30:11.242 --> 30:12.744
Incredible,
they could care less.

30:13.244 --> 30:17.749
This is delicious.

30:17.749 --> 30:20.251
And your grandfather
a contractor.

30:20.251 --> 30:24.756
Deconstructivism.

30:24.756 --> 30:25.757
Ah.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.259
My droll mom.

30:28.259 --> 30:33.264
Excuse me, could you
move your cigarette?

30:33.264 --> 30:35.266
Pardon me?

30:35.266 --> 30:37.268
It's blowing
into my son's face.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.770
Thank you.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.271
We're allowed to smoke.

30:40.271 --> 30:44.275
Unfortunately an area where
new jersey is woefully behind,

30:44.275 --> 30:46.277
but could you move it?

30:46.277 --> 30:47.779
Mom, it's no big deal.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.781
It's no big deal
to move it either.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.282
I don't think so.

30:51.282 --> 30:52.784
I'm sorry?

30:52.784 --> 30:53.785
I'm not
gonna move it.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.286
Why not?

30:55.286 --> 30:57.288
Because you're very rude.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.291
I said excuse me,
quite clearly.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.793
Your tone.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.795
It's a health hazard,
move it.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.296
No.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.298
I'm a physician,

31:07.298 --> 31:09.801
do you know what you're
doing to the rest of us?

31:10.301 --> 31:12.804
My son has taken the trouble
in his own life,

31:12.804 --> 31:14.806
to live in
a smoke- free dorm.

31:14.806 --> 31:16.808
My salutations.

31:16.808 --> 31:17.809
Mom.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.811
This isn't
a smoke- free restaurant.

31:19.811 --> 31:23.815
Look, this is silly, could you
just move the fucking thing?

31:23.815 --> 31:25.316
Not when you
talk like that.

31:25.316 --> 31:27.819
Just move
the cigarette, please?

31:27.819 --> 31:28.820
No.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.321
No?

31:30.321 --> 31:31.322
No.

31:31.322 --> 31:32.824
Mom!

31:32.824 --> 31:33.825
Well?

31:33.825 --> 31:34.826
You bitch.

31:34.826 --> 31:35.827
She must be drunk.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.829
Excuse me,
what did you say?

31:37.829 --> 31:39.330
Ma'am, c'mon.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.332
I saw what happened
let's just, shall we?

31:41.332 --> 31:42.834
Will you
call the police?

31:42.834 --> 31:44.836
I don't think that's warranted,
but ma'am--

31:44.836 --> 31:46.337
oh no, please,
call the police,

31:46.337 --> 31:48.840
because i'm not the one
with a lethal weapon here.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.844
Ma'am, i'd like
you to leave.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.854
C'mon jason.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.355
I'm outta here.

32:20.872 --> 32:21.873
Hello.

32:21.873 --> 32:22.874
In here.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.375
Uncle jun'?

32:24.375 --> 32:29.380
In here,
the kitchen!

32:29.380 --> 32:30.882
Where you been?

32:30.882 --> 32:33.384
I've been calling you
all afternoon.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.887
My fucking hand
is stuck down the drain.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.389
And i can't reach
the fucking phone.

32:38.890 --> 32:42.894
Good thing i'm nice,
'cause i can start tickling you.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.395
Jesus christ.

32:44.395 --> 32:46.397
How long you
been standing there?

32:46.397 --> 32:47.398
Six hours!

32:47.899 --> 32:50.401
Now get the fucking detergent
and lubricate my wrist.

32:50.401 --> 32:55.907
Motherfuckin'
sonofabitch.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.909
I thought
you were bobby.

32:58.409 --> 32:59.911
Why didn't you
just call a plumber?

32:59.911 --> 33:02.413
With what,
my fucking toes?

33:02.413 --> 33:04.415
Relax.

33:04.415 --> 33:06.417
Relax.

33:06.417 --> 33:07.919
Let it go limp.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.922
Limp, you're flexing!

33:10.922 --> 33:12.423
Let it go limp.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.425
Limp.

33:14.425 --> 33:16.928
That's it,
you're flexing.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.430
Limp, that's it
simmer down.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.932
Simmer down.

33:20.932 --> 33:22.934
Easy.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.937
Oh, jesus
fucking christ.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.940
Oh, this fucking house.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.441
I'm dying here.

33:30.441 --> 33:33.945
Just take
it easy, okay?

33:38.950 --> 33:41.452
You're coming to
the engagement party
at least, right?

33:41.452 --> 33:42.954
We'll special
permission.

33:42.954 --> 33:45.957
I'll make
some coffee.

33:45.957 --> 33:49.460
I don't give a shit
if you do or you don't.

33:58.970 --> 33:59.971
It's light.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.973
You got your nephew
to thank for that.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.474
What do you mean?

34:03.975 --> 34:07.478
I ran into him the other day
at the garbage man's ball,

34:07.478 --> 34:08.980
whatever
the fuck it is.

34:08.980 --> 34:13.484
He said we can't sell coke
on the route anymore.

34:13.484 --> 34:14.485
What?

34:14.485 --> 34:15.485
That's what he said.

34:15.485 --> 34:17.487
I guess nobody
should eat, but him.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.991
You should have seen him
in the golf outfit,

34:19.991 --> 34:21.993
he looked like
wallace beery.

34:22.493 --> 34:25.996
Where does he
get the effrontery?

34:25.996 --> 34:27.498
He's the boss.

34:27.998 --> 34:31.002
Whether he has
grand mals or not.

34:31.002 --> 34:32.503
And this shit
is okay with you?

34:33.004 --> 34:35.005
I know how much
you love him, jr.

34:35.005 --> 34:44.014
I don't want to say
anything disparaging.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.516
You know how it is
, they're bureaucrats,

34:47.018 --> 34:48.018
they nit, they pick.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.021
It's passive- aggressive,
pure and simple.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.023
They have their lives,
themselves.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.025
I know, i know,
they're not out in the field.

34:54.025 --> 34:57.027
What can i do
? it's mandatory.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.030
Okay, hold on.

34:59.030 --> 35:03.034
Connie, get me the paperwork
on the separation requirements

35:03.034 --> 35:04.035
for new jersey.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.536
Where is it?

35:05.536 --> 35:12.543
I don't know, i put them
with the recycling files.

35:12.543 --> 35:13.544
Can i get
you something?

35:13.544 --> 35:16.547
Coffee?

35:16.547 --> 35:17.548
No.

35:17.548 --> 35:18.549
No, i'm alright.

35:18.549 --> 35:22.553
I'll be going home soon.

35:33.064 --> 35:35.066
I embarrassed my son.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.568
How's he supposed
to know,

35:37.568 --> 35:40.571
where this type
of behavior is coming from?

35:40.571 --> 35:44.075
Think it's time you considered
a 12- step program?

35:44.075 --> 35:46.577
I'm not an
alcoholic, elliot.

35:46.577 --> 35:51.082
Besides i have you, this.

35:51.082 --> 36:00.091
Therapy isn't a substitute,
you know that.

36:00.091 --> 36:04.595
I won't drink
with my son anymore.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.598
We're bargaining now?

36:07.598 --> 36:10.601
I'll go
to a meeting.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.109
I'm also
prescribing luvox.

36:18.609 --> 36:19.610
Luvox?

36:19.610 --> 36:22.613
Is for ocd.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.615
Among other things,

36:24.615 --> 36:26.617
i've had success
with it treating other
compulsions as well.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.119
Compulsions?
Elliot, c'mon.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.121
You're patient,
jennifer,

36:30.121 --> 36:33.124
your inability to bring
the therapy to a conclusion.

36:33.124 --> 36:39.130
Elliot, i honestly believe
that he's not ready.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.631
Refer him
to another doctor.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.633
You really think
that i'm--

36:43.134 --> 36:44.635
obsessed?

36:53.144 --> 36:59.650
Luvox.

37:00.151 --> 37:04.655
Jesus christ.

37:04.655 --> 37:07.158
That coke provides
a nice income stream.

37:07.158 --> 37:09.660
Do you have any ideas
the bills i got?

37:09.660 --> 37:12.163
Just keep it away
from the garbage routes.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.665
The lawyers, the doctors,
the prescriptions,

37:14.665 --> 37:16.667
a double sawbuck
for a plastic pillow,

37:16.667 --> 37:18.169
just so i can
sit comfortably.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.671
Why don't you just sit on that
nice pile of cash you got?

37:20.671 --> 37:24.175
My finances are nobody's
goddamn business.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.676
And that garbage
is my business.

37:25.676 --> 37:28.679
I don't want you and that
other shit- bird fucking it up.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.181
Your business.

37:30.681 --> 37:36.187
Yeah, why don't you get that
true that bald dome of yours?

37:36.187 --> 37:38.189
Why does everything
have to be so difficult?

37:38.189 --> 37:42.693
You know, back in the'50s
we worked together.

37:42.693 --> 37:46.697
Even rival families settled
their differences, amicably.

37:46.697 --> 37:49.700
Oh yeah, i remember that picture
of albert anastasia lying there

37:49.700 --> 37:51.202
all amicable
on the barbershop floor.

37:51.202 --> 37:58.209
There were exceptions,
i'm just saying.

37:58.209 --> 37:59.710
Oh i'm sorry,
should i come back?

37:59.710 --> 38:01.212
It's alright.

38:01.212 --> 38:03.214
We're done here.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.717
Bad night
last night, huh?

38:06.717 --> 38:09.720
Let's see if we can't
get you a more comfortable
fit on this mask.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.723
That little cupcake,
she never came back.

38:12.723 --> 38:15.726
The one with the mask.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.228
Tracey?

38:17.228 --> 38:20.731
Sent her a bottle
of shalimar.

38:20.731 --> 38:26.237
She never mentioned it.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.739
You should
be happy at least,

38:28.739 --> 38:30.241
the stent was
a complete success.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.744
Let's not tempt fate
by taxing the heart.

38:33.744 --> 38:37.248
How many migs
you shoot down last week?

38:51.262 --> 38:52.763
Where's that
fucking manicott'?

38:52.763 --> 38:55.266
It's gone.

38:55.766 --> 38:57.268
Half a fucking
tray in there!

38:57.268 --> 38:58.769
I was hungry.

38:58.769 --> 39:01.272
Sonofabitch.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.774
It's not my fault
you got your hand caught.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.277
Why do you have
to be so nasty?

39:24.295 --> 39:26.797
Directory assistant,
what listing?

39:26.797 --> 39:30.301
Belleville, i need a number
for a catherine romano.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.803
Thank you,
for what city?

39:33.304 --> 39:35.306
Cocksucker, belleville!

39:35.306 --> 39:42.313
Please hold
for an operator.

39:42.313 --> 39:44.815
Any allergies,
shellfish, perhaps?

39:44.815 --> 39:46.317
No, i eat shrimp
all the time.

39:46.817 --> 39:50.321
Msg? Any change
in medication?

39:50.321 --> 39:51.822
No.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.326
A new laundry detergent,
something like that?

39:55.326 --> 39:57.328
I don't know,
i don't think so.

39:57.328 --> 40:01.832
Have you been under
any undue stress lately?

40:01.832 --> 40:03.334
Is that the only word
you people know?

40:03.334 --> 40:06.337
Sometimes pressure can result
in contact dermatitis.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.838
Oh is that what
that is?

40:07.838 --> 40:09.340
See know i knew
that was bad.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.841
It means rash.

40:10.841 --> 40:14.845
Look at it,
it's bleeding, for chrissake.

40:14.845 --> 40:16.347
You've been
scratching it.

40:16.347 --> 40:20.351
You said you work at
a sanitation transfer station.

40:20.351 --> 40:24.355
Dollars to donuts,
you're being exposed t
o an irritant in the air.

40:24.355 --> 40:25.856
I sit in an office.

40:25.856 --> 40:29.860
I'll write you a scrip
for cortisone cream.

40:29.860 --> 40:36.367
Dr. Cusamano says you've
been seeing a psychotherapist.

40:36.367 --> 40:39.370
So?

40:39.370 --> 40:48.379
I suggest you talk about
stress management with him.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.900
To tell the truth,

41:10.401 --> 41:11.902
i was surprised
to hear from you.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.906
I was sorry we
missed our visit.

41:15.906 --> 41:17.908
I had the feeling
you weren't interested.

41:17.908 --> 41:19.410
No.

41:19.410 --> 41:20.911
No.

41:20.911 --> 41:23.414
I stopped by the other day
but i guess you were out.

41:23.414 --> 41:24.915
It was odd.

41:24.915 --> 41:29.920
I thought i heard
you hollering.

41:29.920 --> 41:30.921
Funny how life works.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.923
The different paths.

41:32.923 --> 41:36.927
Yeah.

41:36.927 --> 41:39.930
All leading
to the cemetery.

41:47.938 --> 41:50.441
Can i ask you
something, corrado?

41:50.441 --> 41:52.943
Was my lou ever...

41:52.943 --> 41:56.447
you know,
on the take?

41:56.447 --> 41:58.449
No, of course not.

41:58.449 --> 42:01.952
Why would you ask
such a thing?

42:01.952 --> 42:05.456
Sometimes you know,
i'd find money.

42:05.456 --> 42:09.960
Hundreds of dollars, cash,
in his pockets at night.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.962
Probably won it
at the racetrack.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.964
You think so?

42:13.964 --> 42:15.466
Sure, why not?

42:15.466 --> 42:19.470
Somebody has to win.

42:27.978 --> 42:31.482
Well the kitchen needs
some work but, you know,

42:31.482 --> 42:33.484
a little marble,
maybe some new fixtures.

42:33.984 --> 42:35.986
It's nice.

42:35.986 --> 42:39.490
You think he'll come
down on the price?

42:39.490 --> 42:40.991
I don't know.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.994
Tony,
it's your sister,

42:44.495 --> 42:45.996
would it kill you to
take a little interest?

42:45.996 --> 42:47.498
I'm here,
ain't i?

42:47.498 --> 42:48.999
Sorry we're late.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.502
The paper says
fox hill lane,

42:52.002 --> 42:56.006
she takes me
to stag trail road.

42:56.006 --> 42:59.009
Not bad, huh, carm?
Oh, wow.

42:59.009 --> 43:01.011
If we have kids, ma's house
is just not big enough.

43:01.512 --> 43:04.014
And like tony says,
it's not our house anyway.

43:04.014 --> 43:06.016
Come here, you gotta
see this bedroom.

43:06.016 --> 43:08.519
You can make a den
out of the closet.

43:15.025 --> 43:16.527
Talked to my uncle
the other day, rich.

43:16.527 --> 43:21.031
Yeah, i heard.

43:21.532 --> 43:27.037
So we're clear on this
drug shit, right richie?

43:27.037 --> 43:31.041
Now the reason i'm asking you,
850 grand's a pretty big nut.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.543
I don't know
if your parole job

43:32.543 --> 43:34.545
at the fish market's
gonna cover it.

43:34.545 --> 43:39.049
Tell me about it.

43:39.550 --> 43:42.553
These walls,
skim- coat.

43:43.053 --> 43:46.056
Not that plain
sheetrock shit.

43:46.056 --> 43:49.560
They put in a lawn
this year, it's new.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.563
When did you
put your lawn in?

43:52.563 --> 43:55.065
Richie.

43:55.065 --> 44:01.071
This is a great
school district.

44:01.071 --> 44:02.072
Are you alright?

44:02.072 --> 44:05.075
I got to go.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.076
What's the matter?

44:06.076 --> 44:07.077
Nothing, just--

44:07.077 --> 44:12.583
i feel hot.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.586
Oh my god, your all clammy,
let's get you home.

44:15.586 --> 44:17.588
No, no, you stay with them
and help them.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.591
I'll see you later.

44:52.623 --> 44:58.128
Oh, you poor bastard.

45:01.632 --> 45:02.633
Hey tony,
you got a minute?

45:02.633 --> 45:05.636
Yeah, sure,
what's up?

45:06.136 --> 45:08.639
What are you doing?

45:08.639 --> 45:10.641
Organizing
a basketball pool,

45:10.641 --> 45:13.143
for the people
in the office.

45:13.143 --> 45:15.145
Yeah sounds great,
should be fun.

45:15.145 --> 45:16.647
Yeah.

45:16.647 --> 45:19.650
I got a call from
a friend of mine in nutley.

45:19.650 --> 45:20.651
Guy's a cop.

45:21.151 --> 45:24.154
They got richie's
driver on video.

45:24.154 --> 45:28.158
He sold three ounces of coke
at an arcade down there.

45:28.158 --> 45:30.160
It's alright,
i talked to richie.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.663
This was last night.

45:32.663 --> 45:38.669
Guess we'll have to
torch a truck or something.

45:38.669 --> 45:42.172
Oh, but you don't
want to hear that.

45:42.673 --> 45:45.676
I sure as shit
didn't say it.

45:55.185 --> 45:57.187
Dick, i'm trying to work
on this office pool.

45:57.187 --> 46:00.190
Sure, i'll
leave you alone.

46:33.223 --> 46:34.224
Hello.

46:34.224 --> 46:35.726
Corrado?

46:35.726 --> 46:38.228
What the fuck are you doing
calling my home?

46:38.228 --> 46:39.730
Now listen,

46:39.730 --> 46:42.733
i'm the only person in
this family who doesn't curse,

46:42.733 --> 46:45.235
so just do me the favor.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.738
I want to see
how your feeling.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.740
Is that so horrible?

46:49.740 --> 46:50.741
I'm fine.

46:50.741 --> 46:53.744
It's not easy being
abandoned, is it?

46:53.744 --> 46:55.746
Look to yourself.

46:56.246 --> 46:59.249
I had a stroke, corrado,
did you hear?

46:59.750 --> 47:02.252
Of course i heard,
i don't live in oshkosh.

47:02.753 --> 47:07.257
I heard you're keeping company
with that catherine romano.

47:07.257 --> 47:08.759
What the fuck?

47:08.759 --> 47:10.260
Never you mind
about that.

47:10.260 --> 47:11.762
Aw, she's so sweet.

47:11.762 --> 47:14.765
I remember
my johnny told me,

47:14.765 --> 47:19.269
she let him feel her up
behind "the sons of italy" hall.

47:19.269 --> 47:22.272
Listen livia, what you
don't know could fill a book.

47:36.787 --> 47:37.788
Is everything
alright?

47:37.788 --> 47:39.790
My brother's wife.

47:39.790 --> 47:42.292
Oh livia,
how is she?

47:42.292 --> 47:43.794
I heard she
wasn't well.

47:43.794 --> 47:44.795
She never was well.

47:45.295 --> 47:46.296
Let's face it.

47:46.296 --> 47:48.298
That woman's
life is very sad.

47:48.298 --> 47:51.301
If she fell
into a sewer pipe,

47:51.301 --> 47:57.808
she'd come up holding
a gold watch in each hand.

47:57.808 --> 48:00.310
This was my father's.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.813
Actually it
was his uncle's.

48:02.813 --> 48:06.316
It's a little sweet, but there's
nothing like homemade wine.

48:06.817 --> 48:09.319
The vinegar eggplant.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.321
From four years ago.

48:11.321 --> 48:12.823
Take some home.

48:12.823 --> 48:14.825
I can't handle
the acidity.

48:14.825 --> 48:19.830
If you like, i can
make us some lunch.

48:19.830 --> 48:21.832
Why go to the bother,

48:21.832 --> 48:23.834
there's a friendly's
on bloomfield avenue.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.836
I can't.

48:26.336 --> 48:29.339
Don't you enjoy
going out corrado?

48:29.339 --> 48:30.841
It's not that
i don't enjoy it.

48:30.841 --> 48:33.343
Well, what is it then,
your heart?

48:33.343 --> 48:37.848
No, it's certain
legal difficulties.

48:38.348 --> 48:40.350
The truth is
i can't go out.

48:40.851 --> 48:41.852
I'm under house arrest.

48:42.352 --> 48:45.355
Oh my god,
does it hurt?

48:45.355 --> 48:50.861
It beeps.

48:50.861 --> 48:53.363
Sends a signal
if i leave the house.

48:53.363 --> 48:54.865
You can't go anywhere?

48:55.365 --> 48:59.369
The choices
we make, huh?

48:59.369 --> 49:00.871
Occasionally i can
get special permission.

49:01.371 --> 49:04.374
Banking, the doctors,
certain family obligations.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.877
For most part though...

49:06.877 --> 49:10.881
i understand if you
don't want to stay.

49:10.881 --> 49:14.885
I enjoy you, corrado,
i always did.

49:14.885 --> 49:18.388
You stay,
i'll bring food in.

49:24.394 --> 49:26.897
Trying to keep a low profile,
what's the fucking point?

49:27.397 --> 49:35.906
I'm still a miserable pric
k and i'm still passing out.

49:36.406 --> 49:38.408
Thing on the history channel
the other night,

49:38.408 --> 49:39.910
on the american revolution.

49:39.910 --> 49:42.412
You know we're the only
country in the world

49:42.412 --> 49:46.917
where the pursuit of happiness
is guaranteed in writing?

49:46.917 --> 49:49.920
You believe that, hmm?

49:50.420 --> 49:51.922
Bunch of fucking
spoiled brats.

49:52.422 --> 49:55.425
Where's my
happiness then?

49:55.425 --> 49:58.428
It's the pursuit
that's guaranteed.

49:58.428 --> 50:00.931
Always a fucking
loophole, right?

50:06.937 --> 50:08.939
Well, you seem
very mellow today.

50:08.939 --> 50:11.942
Let's talk about you.

50:11.942 --> 50:14.945
You seem like you're on drugs
and i'm boring myself to death.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.947
I'm ready for
the george sanders
long walk here.

50:16.947 --> 50:21.451
Do you know why
a shark keeps moving?

50:21.451 --> 50:25.455
They got to keep moving
or they'll die,

50:25.455 --> 50:26.957
they can't breathe
or something.

50:26.957 --> 50:30.961
There's a psychological
condition known as alexithymia,

50:31.461 --> 50:32.963
common in certain
personalities.

50:33.463 --> 50:38.969
The individual craves
almost ceaseless action,

50:38.969 --> 50:46.476
which enables them
to avoid acknowledging
the abhorrent things they do.

50:46.476 --> 50:50.480
Abhorrent?

50:50.480 --> 50:51.982
What certain
personalities?

50:51.982 --> 50:55.485
Antisocial personalities.

51:03.493 --> 51:07.998
My future
brother- in- law...

51:08.498 --> 51:11.001
ran over a guy,
no reason.

51:11.001 --> 51:20.510
Guy's paralyzed, has to
piss into a cathode tube.

51:20.510 --> 51:25.515
What happens when thes
e antisocial personalities

51:25.515 --> 51:29.519
aren't distracted from
the horrible shit they do?

51:29.519 --> 51:32.022
They have time to think
about their behavior.

51:32.022 --> 51:36.526
How what they do
affects other people.

51:36.526 --> 51:42.032
About feelings of emptiness
and self- loathing,

51:42.032 --> 51:49.539
haunting them
since childhood.

51:49.539 --> 51:52.042
And they crash.

51:58.548 --> 51:59.549
Which one
of them knew?

51:59.549 --> 52:01.551
Knew what?

52:01.551 --> 52:04.054
Jerry grill
had asthma...

52:07.057 --> 52:08.058
he never was one
to let common sense

52:08.558 --> 52:10.060
get in the way of
whatever he wanted to do.

52:14.064 --> 52:16.066
What about
chris newman?

52:16.066 --> 52:19.569
Grale's house was
the last thing standing
in the way of that new deli.

52:19.569 --> 52:21.571
I'm sure chris is glad
to see him gone too.

52:21.571 --> 52:22.572
What about howard?

52:23.073 --> 52:24.574
Corrado.

52:24.574 --> 52:26.076
Hmm.

52:26.076 --> 52:31.581
I got caught in
the middle of the fight...

52:31.581 --> 52:33.083
and you have
no broken bones?

52:33.083 --> 52:35.085
Actually they
ignored me.

52:35.085 --> 52:37.087
Fucking thing.

52:37.087 --> 52:42.592
Shh,
with that talk.

52:42.592 --> 52:44.094
...that he'd been
cheatin' on her

52:44.094 --> 52:45.595
where'd you
hear that?

52:45.595 --> 52:47.097
Her father told her while
i was standing there.

52:47.097 --> 52:50.100
Every one of them
had a motive.

52:50.100 --> 52:53.103
The thing is who
had the opportunity

52:53.103 --> 52:56.106
and who was it
who knew he had asthma?

53:07.117 --> 53:07.617
I threw.

53:07.617 --> 53:11.121
C'mon.

53:11.121 --> 53:13.623
Ho, our long
lost leader.

53:13.623 --> 53:15.625
Somebody most
owe him money.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.127
Tony, how you doing?

53:17.627 --> 53:18.628
How's the clay pigeon?

53:19.129 --> 53:23.133
I'm getting there.

53:23.133 --> 53:25.635
You could knock cardoz
o law school all you want,

53:25.635 --> 53:28.138
but his lawyer says
the gun charge will not stick.

53:28.138 --> 53:30.140
Yeah, congratulations.

53:30.140 --> 53:33.143
We were talking about
you know, down the docks.

53:33.143 --> 53:36.146
Driving off some off
that japanese technology.

53:36.146 --> 53:38.148
Hesh knows a guy.

53:38.648 --> 53:43.153
Oh yeah?

53:43.153 --> 53:44.154
So what else
is going on?

53:44.154 --> 53:46.656
Nothing.

53:57.167 --> 54:00.170
I'm having good luck
with swiss basics'
moisturizing formula.

54:00.170 --> 54:08.178
Maybe i'll try it.

54:08.178 --> 54:10.180
Oh!

54:10.180 --> 54:14.184
Yeah!

54:21.191 --> 54:22.692
What the fuck?

54:28.198 --> 54:29.199
Holy shit.

54:29.699 --> 54:31.201
Look at that.

54:31.201 --> 54:32.702
It's that dipshit
carmine again.

54:33.203 --> 54:35.705
Sil, go tell him no speeding
in neighborhood.

54:36.206 --> 54:37.207
I'm on it.

54:37.207 --> 54:38.208
C'mon.

54:38.208 --> 54:39.709
What an asshole.

54:39.709 --> 54:42.212
Carmine, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

54:42.212 --> 54:43.213
How many times
we gotta tell you,

54:43.713 --> 54:45.215
do not speed in this
fucking neighborhood!

54:52.222 --> 54:52.722
C'mon, you hurt?

54:52.722 --> 54:54.224
That's too bad,

54:54.224 --> 54:56.226
you should be fucking crippled,
you fucking asshole!

54:56.726 --> 54:58.228
Don't do that again
you understand me?

54:58.228 --> 54:59.729
Understand me?

54:59.729 --> 55:01.231
People could be fucking hurt,
you know that?

55:01.731 --> 55:02.232
You know that?

55:02.732 --> 55:03.733
You alright?

55:03.733 --> 55:07.237
You sure?

55:07.237 --> 55:09.739
Tony.
