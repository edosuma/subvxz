Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:02.708 --> 00:07.297
He's dead. No, no!
I can't, I can't, I can't.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.144
We all want the cure.
Where is it?

00:09.145 --> 00:10.849
- I know someone has it.
- Katherine.

00:10.850 --> 00:11.970
The doppelganger?

00:12.220 --> 00:14.847
- She had someone on the inside.
- Hayley, what did you do?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.205
- Where did Katherine find her?
- New Orleans.

00:17.206 --> 00:19.539
I can help you.
Turn it off.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.473
Her humanity, Damon.
That was all she had left.

00:22.474 --> 00:25.085
Humanity means nothing when you don't
have anyone to care about, Stefan.

00:25.086 --> 00:26.948
Every inch of this house...

00:26.949 --> 00:29.400
It's filled with memories of
the people that have died.

01:02.484 --> 01:04.101
We're gonna lose her, Damon.

01:04.102 --> 01:06.821
She needs time.
It's only been a couple of days.

01:06.822 --> 01:08.399
Her humanity is off.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.200
She's basically numb to everything
that makes her who she is.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.424
She's a vampire.

01:12.425 --> 01:14.366
The off switch is one
of the biggest perks.

01:14.367 --> 01:17.065
When being undead
gets you down, voila.

01:17.066 --> 01:18.500
Vampire Prozac.

01:18.501 --> 01:21.522
She burned down her family home

01:21.523 --> 01:24.048
with her brother's
dead body still inside.

01:24.049 --> 01:26.074
Saves us the trouble of
having to do it ourselves.

01:26.075 --> 01:27.557
I call that a win.

01:36.006 --> 01:38.753
Worst-case scenario,
I'll invoke the sire bond

01:38.754 --> 01:42.256
- and tell her to turn it back on.
- No. Her brother just died.

01:42.257 --> 01:45.593
You force all that grief on her at
once, it's gonna overwhelm her.

01:45.594 --> 01:48.712
We need to give her a reason
to want to turn it on.

01:49.598 --> 01:53.001
Fine. We'll show her a good time.

01:53.002 --> 01:56.907
I know it's controversial, Stefan,
but people actually like to have fun.

01:56.908 --> 02:00.157
- You really think that's gonna work?
- There's only one way to find out.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.010
Are you all right?

02:04.011 --> 02:07.280
Was there an accident? Where
are you hurt? Are you in pain?

02:11.002 --> 02:13.972
- I don't feel anything.
- I have a blanket in my car.

02:13.973 --> 02:16.136
Try not to move.
I'll call for help.

02:26.538 --> 02:28.786
What are you doing?

02:32.235 --> 02:33.862
Uh!

02:34.360 --> 02:36.411
That's enough.

02:36.412 --> 02:38.990
I said that's enough.

02:38.991 --> 02:40.415
We agreed no killing.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.250
This is the first
person I've seen in days

02:42.251 --> 02:44.586
whose body isn't laced with
vervain, and I'm hungry.

02:44.587 --> 02:47.505
You leave a trail of bodies, people
are gonna start asking questions.

02:47.506 --> 02:49.007
I don't care.

02:50.593 --> 02:51.960
I can't believe you're
making me say this.

02:51.961 --> 02:53.511
Hey.

02:53.512 --> 02:56.463
Show a little restraint.

02:58.332 --> 03:00.305
I thought this was
supposed to be fun.

03:43.806 --> 03:47.398
Have a care, mate.
That's no way to treat a lady.

03:56.777 --> 03:58.302
You came.

03:58.303 --> 04:00.398
Well, you did say it was urgent.

04:00.399 --> 04:02.112
Oh...

04:05.536 --> 04:07.735
Oh, don't worry about him, love.

04:07.736 --> 04:09.833
He'll never make it
through tomorrow night.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.458
What if there are more?

04:11.459 --> 04:14.909
You were foolish enough to make
a deal with Katerina Petrova.

04:14.910 --> 04:16.244
She used you to find the cure,

04:16.245 --> 04:17.577
and now you're nothing
but a loose end.

04:17.579 --> 04:19.343
You'll be lucky if
she lets you live.

04:19.344 --> 04:21.344
You said you would protect me.

04:21.510 --> 04:25.303
And I will, just as soon as
you tell me everything you know

04:25.304 --> 04:27.387
about Katerina.

04:32.894 --> 04:37.281
So that's the plan? You're
gonna take her back to school?

04:37.282 --> 04:39.567
Well, the fun route didn't
exactly pay off, did it?

04:39.568 --> 04:41.727
I don't know.
We got a free meal out of it.

04:41.728 --> 04:43.604
Look. Do you think I want to go
to school and play chaperone?

04:43.605 --> 04:45.439
You can't go because
you're not a student.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.075
Besides, you've got to
go look for Katherine.

04:47.076 --> 04:49.081
I mean, Elena needs this
cure now more than ever.

04:49.082 --> 04:50.745
Not that anyone asked me,

04:50.746 --> 04:53.915
but I think taking her back
to school is a great idea.

04:53.916 --> 04:55.378
Why are you here?

04:55.544 --> 04:57.379
Blame it on
your fancy water filters.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.453
Your house has the only
vervain-free showers in town.

04:59.454 --> 05:03.291
Oh, yeah. The mayor put
vervain in the water supply.

05:03.292 --> 05:04.843
So many people to kill.

05:04.844 --> 05:07.145
Yeah, and my mom says
it's about to get worse,

05:07.146 --> 05:09.296
so she could use a little help.

05:10.631 --> 05:13.268
Fine. I'll go after
the psychotic doppelganger.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.107
Stefan, you gonna go
talk to the sheriff?

05:15.571 --> 05:17.484
Blondie, take her to school.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.806
Sounds like fun.

05:27.159 --> 05:30.200
What? It's nothing you
guys haven't seen before.

05:31.319 --> 05:35.156
And as for the "going
to school" idea...

05:35.157 --> 05:37.128
I've got nothing better to do.

05:41.096 --> 05:45.166
Elena, it would make me very happy
if you were in school today

05:45.167 --> 05:49.516
and studied hard... You know, get
involved in whatever activities,

05:49.517 --> 05:54.730
and please, for me, no matter
what, don't eat anyone.

05:56.728 --> 05:57.812
OK?

06:21.964 --> 06:24.038
Hey, Tyler.
It's me checking in.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.424
Things are just getting back
to normal here, sort of.

06:27.425 --> 06:31.228
Elena's not quite there,
but we're working on it.

06:33.181 --> 06:34.766
Look, I know that
you can't call me back,

06:34.767 --> 06:39.187
but I keep thinking if
I just leave these messages

06:39.188 --> 06:42.273
that when you do come home
it'll be like you never left.

06:42.274 --> 06:44.776
Or that's the hope.

06:44.777 --> 06:47.745
Well, I'd better go.

06:47.746 --> 06:49.446
I love you, Tyler.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.067
Hey, have you seen Bonnie?

06:53.068 --> 06:54.836
Yeah. I called her last night.
She's fine.

06:54.837 --> 06:58.456
She's just a little drained from,
you know, everything.

06:58.457 --> 06:59.457
Can't really blame her.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.458
Yeah.

07:00.459 --> 07:02.760
I have an idea.

07:02.761 --> 07:05.597
Can you get me my old spot back
on the cheerleading squad?

07:05.598 --> 07:07.415
I mean, technically, yeah.

07:07.416 --> 07:10.251
I'm Captain, but I thought
you hated cheerleading.

07:10.252 --> 07:11.803
I did, and now I think
it would be really fun

07:11.804 --> 07:13.922
to jump around and toss
people up in the air.

07:13.923 --> 07:15.686
It's not like
the routines are that hard.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.857
I... think that would
make Damon really happy.

07:22.730 --> 07:26.234
Ah, what an unpleasant surprise.

07:26.235 --> 07:32.243
So I just came up with a
list called things you suck at.

07:32.290 --> 07:35.543
Finding Katherine, ever.

07:35.544 --> 07:38.546
Covering up
your secret phone conversations

07:38.547 --> 07:41.253
to that little backstabber Hayley.

07:41.254 --> 07:46.756
Yeah, so where is she, and what
does she know about Katherine?

07:46.757 --> 07:47.968
I should help you?

07:48.424 --> 07:49.891
After you lot killed my brother

07:49.892 --> 07:51.559
and imprisoned me in
the Gilbert living room?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.227
You might want to prioritize,
Klaus.

07:53.228 --> 07:56.685
You have much bigger problems.

07:56.686 --> 07:59.604
Katherine has the cure.

08:00.185 --> 08:03.438
My guess is she's gonna want
to cram it down your throat.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.640
You help me find Katherine, I'll get
the cure, I'll give it to Elena,

08:06.641 --> 08:08.321
everybody wins.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.644
Just let me question
Hayley about Katherine.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.648
Can't help you, mate.

08:14.649 --> 08:16.167
Hayley's all mine.

08:16.168 --> 08:18.953
Although I did have a run-in

08:18.954 --> 08:22.423
with a vampire who may
know where Katerina is.

08:22.424 --> 08:24.509
Too bad for you I bit halfway
through his bloody neck.

08:24.510 --> 08:27.660
Probably won't have
much time for chit-chat.

08:29.630 --> 08:32.342
The entire supply of
blood from the hospital,

08:32.344 --> 08:35.836
all the reserves,
gone, just vanished.

08:35.837 --> 08:38.188
I don't understand.
Are you accusing us?

08:38.188 --> 08:41.308
No, I'm not accusing you, but
this town is at a tipping point.

08:41.309 --> 08:45.011
Any more unexplained house fires,
and things are gonna boil over.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.034
I'm sorry.
I know it's not your fault.

08:50.035 --> 08:52.035
It's been a rough week.

08:53.521 --> 08:56.040
Miranda Gilbert was one of
my best friends in High School.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.709
To see what's happened to her family...
It's just...

09:00.912 --> 09:06.753
Look, Liz... If there's anything I
can do to help, I promise I will.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.720
Good. You need to.

09:08.721 --> 09:11.205
Whoever stole that blood put
a lot of lives in danger

09:11.206 --> 09:14.680
and risks exposing all of
you, my daughter included.

09:15.977 --> 09:18.396
So who can you think of
who wants blood that bad,

09:18.397 --> 09:19.977
who would be so careless?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.338
The uniform still fits.

09:48.761 --> 09:50.794
You look fantastic.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.600
We are totally gonna
kick grove hill's ass.

09:53.601 --> 09:55.850
Yeah. Should be fun.

09:55.851 --> 09:59.641
Oh, my God. You guys,
I left my makeup back on the bus.

10:01.055 --> 10:03.424
Wow. The competition's
bigger than last year.

10:03.425 --> 10:05.225
I'm gonna go stretch.

10:35.923 --> 10:38.092
I like your ribbon.

10:38.093 --> 10:39.264
Um, thanks.

10:39.265 --> 10:41.729
I want it.

10:41.730 --> 10:44.519
Yeah, but I'm using it,
so go get your own.

11:12.057 --> 11:15.058
Hey, where were you?
We're going on any minute.

11:15.059 --> 11:16.225
I'm here, aren't I?

11:16.226 --> 11:17.361
What's with the ribbon?

11:17.362 --> 11:19.479
That's not even our colors.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.543
Are you out of your mind?

11:32.544 --> 11:33.543
What is your problem?

11:33.544 --> 11:34.995
Feeding on the competition?

11:34.996 --> 11:37.071
Hello. Did you not
hear what Damon told you?

11:37.072 --> 11:40.283
I did, but who cares?
I'll do whatever I want.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.492
Everything all right?

11:41.658 --> 11:45.871
Yeah, as soon as the queen backs
off, everything will be fine.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.383
Remember how Damon
sired her to behave?

11:56.384 --> 11:57.818
It didn't really work.

11:57.819 --> 11:59.353
What do you mean, she fed?

11:59.354 --> 12:01.054
I specifically told her,
no feeding.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.556
The sire bond
should make her listen.

12:02.557 --> 12:03.691
Right. That's what I'm saying.

12:03.692 --> 12:05.392
The sire bond isn't working.

12:05.393 --> 12:06.443
That's impossible.

12:06.444 --> 12:08.228
Think about it.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.731
Elena's sire bond stems from
her feelings for you, right?

12:10.732 --> 12:13.066
With her humanity off,
she has no feelings.

12:13.067 --> 12:16.737
All I wanted was to
break that damn bond.

12:16.738 --> 12:18.071
You're telling me
now this whole time

12:18.072 --> 12:20.391
all she had to do was turn it off?

12:20.392 --> 12:22.376
What happens if
she turns it back on?

12:22.377 --> 12:25.012
I don't know, but more importantly,
where are you right now?

12:25.013 --> 12:27.748
I'm at a truck stop in the boonies
looking for a dead vampire

12:27.749 --> 12:30.250
that might lead to
Katherine and the cure.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.275
Look, just grab her
and get her home.

12:38.276 --> 12:40.943
I'll be there when I can.

12:50.287 --> 12:53.857
You. I thought you were still
vacationing on numbskull island.

12:53.858 --> 12:55.609
Well, I was looking for answers,

12:55.610 --> 12:58.579
and all I found was
your Professor Shane, dead,

12:58.580 --> 13:00.714
and with him, anything
anyone knows about the cure.

13:00.715 --> 13:02.915
Guess you won't turn into
a real girl after all.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.284
I'll get the cure.

13:04.753 --> 13:06.970
I just need Katherine, and I'm
betting you can help me find her.

13:06.971 --> 13:08.921
Why would I help you?

13:10.791 --> 13:13.877
Because I was smart enough to bring
a pinch of my brother's blood.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.171
How else would you
interrogate a vampire

13:16.172 --> 13:18.465
who's practically
dead from a wolf bite?

13:20.317 --> 13:23.070
Fine. Follow me.

13:23.071 --> 13:24.679
I might know where to look.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.931
So you're
rested, you're fed.

13:33.932 --> 13:35.582
Tell me about Katerina.

13:35.583 --> 13:39.319
Most men get their power kick
from torture and intimidation.

13:39.320 --> 13:44.324
With you,
it's drinks and fine dining.

13:44.325 --> 13:48.378
Well, in your case, I favor
hospitality over unpleasantness,

13:48.379 --> 13:51.799
but I have been known to
change my mind on a whim.

13:51.800 --> 13:52.832
Where is Katerina?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.635
You seriously think I know?

13:54.636 --> 13:56.303
You tipped her off
as to what we were up to

13:56.304 --> 13:57.805
and set her on a course
to find the cure.

13:57.806 --> 14:00.340
In return, she sent
her lackey to snuff you out.

14:01.825 --> 14:05.387
Tell me, what did
Katerina promise you?

14:11.735 --> 14:14.154
I was in new Orleans
trying to find information

14:14.155 --> 14:16.523
about my real parents.

14:16.524 --> 14:21.228
Katherine found me
and told me she could help.

14:21.229 --> 14:22.445
An orphan?

14:24.321 --> 14:26.166
Well, that does explain
your charming bravado.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.867
Abandonment issues
will do it every time.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.069
Sounds like you would know.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.711
I'm the only one
that can protect you.

14:37.712 --> 14:41.047
I'm happy to do so,
provided you cooperate.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.384
Hey, we need to talk.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.354
So talk. You can help me stretch.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.598
OK.

14:51.075 --> 14:52.726
Did you feed on that cheerleader?

14:52.727 --> 14:54.528
Maybe.

14:54.529 --> 14:55.746
I see.

14:55.747 --> 14:57.197
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

14:57.198 --> 15:00.400
about the hospital's missing
blood supply, would you?

15:00.401 --> 15:02.169
Trust me.
I'm sick of blood bags.

15:02.170 --> 15:04.587
I prefer something a little warmer.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.909
Look, Elena, I know what
you're going through.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.745
I was having the time of my
life when I first turned, too.

15:12.746 --> 15:16.300
I didn't start ripping
people's heads off until 1912.

15:16.301 --> 15:18.709
The next thing I know,
I was killing an entire village.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.021
Am I supposed to be
scared of becoming you?

15:21.022 --> 15:24.213
Yeah, you are, because I know
how deep down you can fall,

15:24.214 --> 15:26.943
and I know how difficult
it is to climb back out.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.380
Come on.

15:30.381 --> 15:32.766
You're better than this.

15:32.767 --> 15:37.036
I don't know. Maybe this is
the better version of me.

15:37.037 --> 15:42.709
Up next, Mystic
Falls' very own lady timberwolves.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.778
No way. You are not cheering.

15:44.779 --> 15:46.362
Let's see you try and stop me.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.755
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:54.756 --> 15:57.290
give it up for
your very own lady timberwolves.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.585
Ready!

16:02.669 --> 16:08.668
L-o-l, o-m-g You're
looking at Mystic Falls varsity!

16:09.636 --> 16:12.823
B-e-a-t, beat those caps.

16:12.824 --> 16:15.641
B-e-a-t, beat those caps.

16:16.391 --> 16:19.695
B-e-a-t, beat those caps!

16:53.973 --> 16:55.190
Nice move.

16:55.191 --> 16:57.277
What do you do for an encore?

16:57.278 --> 16:59.612
I'm pretty sure it doesn't involve
another condescending lecture.

16:59.613 --> 17:00.978
No. I was impressed.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.099
Getting yourself on the
cheerleading squad.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.276
Plenty of vervain-free victims
bused in for the competition.

17:06.277 --> 17:08.271
You played us all really well.

17:08.271 --> 17:10.272
It wasn't that hard.

17:10.273 --> 17:14.075
You want me to be OK so badly that
you hear whatever I want you to.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.703
Right. Well, you know,
the problem with the gymnasium is,

17:17.164 --> 17:18.580
too many witnesses.

17:18.582 --> 17:20.781
You got to go somewhere a little
more private for some real fun.

17:20.782 --> 17:22.625
Oh, yeah? Where?

17:22.626 --> 17:26.472
I know this little dive
bar off the beaten path.

17:26.473 --> 17:27.924
Come on.

17:27.925 --> 17:29.048
You're bluffing.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.843
You're forgetting that I had my
switch flipped in this town, too.

17:33.963 --> 17:36.055
I know where to take
someone to have a good time.

17:38.134 --> 17:43.155
But first, a little vervain,
just to take the edge off.

17:47.777 --> 17:49.112
Why exactly would you think

17:49.113 --> 17:51.030
a sick vampire would
check into a hospital?

17:51.031 --> 17:52.498
See that little bright
thing in the sky?

17:52.499 --> 17:53.583
It's called the sun.

17:53.584 --> 17:54.667
He needs to avoid that.

17:54.668 --> 17:56.993
Plus the hospital is open 24/7.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.870
Not to mention
he's hungry and delusional.

18:14.804 --> 18:18.857
Impressive. You're like Sherlock
Holmes with brain damage.

18:24.147 --> 18:25.515
Stefan said
the Mystic Falls hospital

18:25.516 --> 18:27.850
had its entire blood
bank raided, too.

18:27.851 --> 18:29.518
It looks like
our vampire gets around.

18:29.519 --> 18:31.687
No. The guy's dying
of a werewolf bite.

18:31.688 --> 18:34.707
He wouldn't have time to
steal from both hospitals.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.659
This is someone else.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.511
Who?

18:38.512 --> 18:40.995
That's another problem.

18:40.996 --> 18:44.667
But on the plus side,
if our guy did by chance come here,

18:44.668 --> 18:49.671
he's got nothing, which means
he's nearby and he's hungry.

18:49.672 --> 18:51.040
This better not be
a wild goose chase.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.559
I want to find Katherine
as much as you do.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.511
Really? Why?

18:55.512 --> 18:56.729
I heard your little
chat with Stefan.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.714
I know Elena has
broken the sire bond.

18:58.715 --> 19:01.351
So why would you
want to find the cure?

19:01.352 --> 19:05.686
You'd just cure her back
to loving your brother.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.206
I think you're best off
leaving it for me.

19:17.617 --> 19:20.115
Hate that.

19:20.116 --> 19:22.071
Too much.

19:22.072 --> 19:23.789
I don't get that.

19:25.241 --> 19:29.412
Hmm... I don't care.

19:29.413 --> 19:32.214
Hmm. This one.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.052
It doesn't make me want to puke.

19:40.423 --> 19:41.858
Why'd you paint it?

19:41.859 --> 19:44.759
Painting is a metaphor for control.

19:46.446 --> 19:50.366
Every choice is mine...
The canvas, the color.

19:50.367 --> 19:52.402
As a child, I had
neither a sense of the world

19:52.403 --> 19:54.235
nor my place in it,
but art taught me

19:54.771 --> 19:56.105
that one's vision can be achieved

19:56.611 --> 19:58.447
with sheer force of will.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.618
The same is true of life,

20:02.045 --> 20:06.298
provided one refuses to let
anything stand in one's way.

20:13.256 --> 20:18.794
So this is your thing... Show a
girl a few mediocre paintings,

20:18.795 --> 20:20.345
whine about your childhood,

20:20.346 --> 20:24.400
and I swoon and spill
all my dirty secrets?

20:24.401 --> 20:29.895
I felt I had many charms, but, uh,
regardless, I'm enjoying myself.

20:29.896 --> 20:34.327
And you do whatever you enjoy,

20:34.328 --> 20:38.488
up to and including hunting my
friend Tyler for the next century.

20:38.489 --> 20:41.483
Oh, surely not the next century.

20:42.618 --> 20:44.827
Only until I kill him.

20:44.828 --> 20:48.958
You talk a good game, but the
truth is you let him go.

20:48.959 --> 20:53.829
You know if you kill him,
Caroline will hate you forever.

20:53.830 --> 20:58.925
If I simply killed Tyler, my
revenge would be over in a moment.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.837
Sentencing him to a lifetime
of paranoia and fear...

21:01.838 --> 21:04.806
That's Tyler's true punishment.

21:04.807 --> 21:06.975
But come now.

21:06.976 --> 21:10.480
You never really thought there
was a future for you two, did you?

21:10.481 --> 21:11.814
I don't know.

21:11.815 --> 21:17.186
He might have left Caroline for me
if I'd used the cure to kill you.

21:17.187 --> 21:19.338
You know, if Tyler has
even half your resolve,

21:19.339 --> 21:22.191
he may actually make
it through the year.

21:22.192 --> 21:23.876
It doesn't take resolve.

21:23.877 --> 21:29.532
It takes allies, a network of people
willing to do anything for you,

21:29.533 --> 21:33.034
including chase down
loose ends to their death.

21:34.370 --> 21:37.172
That's how Katherine
escaped you all this time.

21:39.225 --> 21:45.012
Perhaps you know the names of
Katerina's special little helpers.

21:45.013 --> 21:47.899
Maybe I know one or two.

21:48.818 --> 21:51.553
Maybe I'll even tell you.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.195
What'd you do to me?

21:59.196 --> 22:01.364
Brought you home before you
can cause any more trouble.

22:01.365 --> 22:05.199
So you're grounding me because I
dropped Caroline on her thick head.

22:05.200 --> 22:11.039
No, because you fed on someone...
In public.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.458
So? I was hungry.

22:18.798 --> 22:20.633
You're really gonna keep
stripping in front of me?

22:20.634 --> 22:22.084
It's real mature.

22:22.085 --> 22:26.421
I'm done cheering,
so I'm gonna change.

22:26.422 --> 22:31.777
Sure. When in doubt,
manipulate people with sex.

22:31.778 --> 22:34.763
You know, that's the same
trick Katherine used to pull.

22:34.764 --> 22:36.866
Don't compare me to Katherine.

22:36.867 --> 22:40.786
She's been running so long,
she's afraid of her own shadow.

22:40.787 --> 22:45.441
I am not afraid of anything.

22:45.442 --> 22:50.962
I've shut it all off... all of it,
including my feelings for you.

22:52.415 --> 22:53.549
But don't get me wrong.

22:53.550 --> 22:57.470
I mean, I see you standing
there, and you look good.

22:57.471 --> 22:59.255
I remember our sex,
and it was good sex.

22:59.256 --> 23:02.957
I just don't feel
anything about it anymore.

23:05.678 --> 23:07.053
Though you clearly do.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.513
Why do you care what
I do and who I kill?

23:09.514 --> 23:11.817
Because it's my fault
that you're like this.

23:11.818 --> 23:15.520
I brought this into your life.

23:15.521 --> 23:18.441
Look, I've killed hundreds of people,
and I have to live with that,

23:18.442 --> 23:20.493
but I'm not gonna live with
the people that you kill

23:20.494 --> 23:22.444
or what that'll do to you.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.449
Who are you texting?

23:26.450 --> 23:29.919
OK. Your whole world
revolves around me.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.671
Maybe you're the one
that needs to turn it all off.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.127
What is that?

23:58.981 --> 24:01.065
So that's what all
this texting was about?

24:01.568 --> 24:04.234
You invited all these
people over here.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.355
You were trying to keep me
from throwing the party,

24:06.356 --> 24:09.991
so... I brought the party here.

24:13.028 --> 24:14.696
Great.

24:16.549 --> 24:18.032
That's great.

24:27.749 --> 24:29.250
Whoo!

24:32.387 --> 24:34.857
I got here as soon as I could.
This is insane.

24:34.858 --> 24:36.725
Yeah.
It wonast.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.227
They'll either drink all
the booze and get bored,

24:38.228 --> 24:41.614
or Damon will come
home and kill everyone.

24:41.615 --> 24:43.315
We can't
compel them to leave.

24:43.316 --> 24:46.118
The locals are all on vervain
from the town water supply.

24:46.119 --> 24:48.911
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know.

24:48.912 --> 24:51.557
Enjoy the party,
keep Elena from butchering

24:51.558 --> 24:53.442
grove hill's cheerleading squad.

24:53.908 --> 24:55.776
Great.
And where is she?

24:56.022 --> 24:57.495
Where do you think?

25:04.919 --> 25:07.423
I almost forgot what that was like.

25:07.424 --> 25:09.325
What? Elena smiling?

25:09.326 --> 25:11.310
No. Fun.

25:11.311 --> 25:12.428
I mean, look at her.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.263
Yes, this is all very bad,

25:14.264 --> 25:17.515
but doesn't she make
you just want to let go?

25:18.800 --> 25:22.644
Well, unfortunately
I have this little problem

25:22.645 --> 25:24.823
when I, uh, party too hard.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.442
I end up killing people.

25:26.443 --> 25:30.529
Well, your sober coach is
giving you the green light.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.699
I mean, come on. You are at
a kegger full of hot girls,

25:33.700 --> 25:37.319
and you're single,
and you're, well, you.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.787
So, what am I supposed to do,

25:38.788 --> 25:42.758
just grab some girl,
throw her over my shoulder,

25:42.759 --> 25:44.627
take her out onto the dance floor?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.345
Just take your own advice.

25:46.346 --> 25:47.463
Have fun, you know?

25:47.464 --> 25:49.506
We deserve a little bit of fun.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.512
Whoa! I didn't mean me!

26:05.064 --> 26:08.517
Well, nobody could ever
mistake you for subtle.

26:08.518 --> 26:10.402
You have to take
pride in your work.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.523
It's OK. Come here.

26:14.524 --> 26:17.409
Now you're gonna walk
very slowly to your car.

26:20.195 --> 26:21.663
Off you go.

26:22.548 --> 26:25.551
You know, I just don't see how
this increases our odds any.

26:25.552 --> 26:27.219
I've been on the other
side of a wolf bite.

26:27.220 --> 26:28.721
First you get really sick.

26:28.722 --> 26:29.888
Then you get really hungry.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.757
Since the sun's gone down,

26:31.758 --> 26:33.375
I'm imagining he's gonna be
looking for his last supper.

26:33.376 --> 26:37.261
I just laid out a 3-course,
115-pound meal for him.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.292
Damon?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.627
Will?

27:08.628 --> 27:10.461
Hey, buddy.

27:12.715 --> 27:16.417
I think there's
something wrong with me.

27:16.418 --> 27:17.759
I need help.

27:19.921 --> 27:21.890
Yeah. It's OK.

27:21.891 --> 27:24.226
Yeah. I know what to do.

27:29.364 --> 27:31.525
What the bloody hell are you doing?

27:31.526 --> 27:33.202
Too far gone.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.119
Put him out of his misery.

27:39.908 --> 27:44.796
My sister informs me that your
vampire assailant is dead,

27:45.204 --> 27:49.618
so you're safe and free to go.

27:49.619 --> 27:50.968
Or stay.

27:57.226 --> 28:03.015
I could be persuaded to stay,
enjoy some of the good life.

28:04.098 --> 28:06.902
And maybe I could drum up
a few more of Katherine's secrets

28:06.903 --> 28:08.520
and you could do something for me.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.606
Oh, I'm sorry, love.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.859
You'll never convince me
to let Tyler go free.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.362
Well, then, I guess I'll never get
my chance with Tyler

28:17.363 --> 28:20.407
any more than you'll get
a shot with Caroline.

28:28.090 --> 28:30.676
Do you want to know why
I like that painting?

28:30.677 --> 28:32.427
Well, perhaps it was
because it allowed you

28:32.428 --> 28:35.496
to see into my deep, wounded soul.

28:39.017 --> 28:42.854
I saw how twisted it really is.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.687
And maybe I can relate.

28:53.348 --> 28:55.851
So what's it gonna be?

28:55.852 --> 28:57.568
Going...

29:01.740 --> 29:03.541
Or staying?

29:05.360 --> 29:08.913
You like to be in control,
you told me.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.739
Look who finally joined the party.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.542
Yeah. Why?
Are you jealous or something?

30:27.543 --> 30:29.244
No. That would imply emotions,

30:29.245 --> 30:30.963
and we've already established
those are useless.

30:30.964 --> 30:32.948
Come on, Elena.
Just dance with us.

30:32.949 --> 30:34.783
No. You guys look good together.

30:34.784 --> 30:37.586
By all means, care,
just take him out for a spin.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.086
He could use it.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.795
Elena.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.633
What's going on in here?

30:52.634 --> 30:55.396
Just some underage
drinking and drug use.

30:55.397 --> 30:57.105
Where's Stefan?

30:57.106 --> 30:59.316
He's actually busy flirting
with your daughter.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.142
But I think he's
a good rebound for her

31:01.143 --> 31:02.828
because of the whole Tyler thing.

31:02.829 --> 31:04.529
I'm shutting this down right now.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.483
Liz, please. Why don't you
just stay and have a drink?

31:08.484 --> 31:09.835
Elena, take your hand off me.

31:09.836 --> 31:12.820
Either you have a drink, or I will.

31:15.289 --> 31:16.875
Mom!

31:18.641 --> 31:19.729
I'm fine.

31:21.128 --> 31:22.664
Caroline, calm down.

31:22.665 --> 31:25.166
Calm down? I'm gonna wring
her skinny little neck!

31:39.610 --> 31:41.097
Elena!

31:41.098 --> 31:42.431
Where the hell is she?

31:42.432 --> 31:43.736
Right where she wants to be.

31:43.737 --> 31:45.417
This is completely calculated.

31:45.418 --> 31:46.802
She drew all those
people to the house,

31:46.803 --> 31:49.688
waited for an opportunity to
distract us, and now she's free.

31:49.689 --> 31:51.107
I can't believe she's doing this.

31:51.108 --> 31:53.425
I mean, she hurt my mom, Stefan.

31:53.426 --> 31:54.760
All right, listen.

31:54.761 --> 31:57.063
You search the woods.
I'll check the road.

31:57.064 --> 31:58.531
If you see her, don't hesitate.

31:58.532 --> 32:01.100
Just snap her neck, all right?

32:01.101 --> 32:02.735
Yeah.

32:02.736 --> 32:04.285
OK.

32:13.462 --> 32:15.613
Thank you.

32:21.887 --> 32:23.956
Will you please just take
a hint and leave me alone?

32:23.957 --> 32:25.903
What are you hiding?

32:25.904 --> 32:27.821
I know you knew that vampire.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.294
I know a lot of dead people.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.397
You killed him to prevent
me from finding Katherine

32:31.398 --> 32:32.898
to keep me from getting the cure.

32:33.367 --> 32:34.750
Do you really want the cure?

32:34.751 --> 32:37.103
I mean really?

32:37.104 --> 32:41.490
Look. Let me give you
a little bit of advice.

32:41.491 --> 32:45.277
See these girls?
They look happy now.

32:45.278 --> 32:48.147
In 5 years, they're gonna settle
for a mediocre starter husband

32:48.148 --> 32:51.584
and a mind-numbing career, and about
that time, they're gonna realize

32:51.585 --> 32:53.639
something you're never
gonna have to learn.

32:54.087 --> 32:55.855
And what would that be?

32:55.856 --> 32:58.591
Life sucks when you're ordinary.

32:58.592 --> 33:01.844
And what makes you
exactly not like them?

33:01.845 --> 33:03.129
You're a vampire.

33:03.647 --> 33:09.001
You take that cure, become human,
well, you're no one, nothing.

33:09.002 --> 33:10.553
Trust me.
Losing this cure

33:10.554 --> 33:13.021
is the best damn thing
that ever happened to you.

33:28.380 --> 33:30.071
Elena!

33:32.718 --> 33:34.193
Don't make me fight you, Elena!

33:34.194 --> 33:37.140
I'm stronger than you,
and I don't want to hurt you.

33:40.883 --> 33:42.519
Who's gonna get hurt?

33:46.472 --> 33:48.724
Not bad.
Not technically good,

33:48.725 --> 33:52.178
but then again,
Alaric didn't train you.

33:52.179 --> 33:55.714
You were probably too busy
butting into people's business!

33:56.283 --> 33:57.516
Uh!

33:57.517 --> 33:58.934
Uh!

33:58.935 --> 33:59.935
Uh!

33:59.936 --> 34:01.831
Oh, just stop!

34:01.832 --> 34:06.692
God. This isn't you,
and you know it!

34:06.693 --> 34:08.393
You hurt my mom, Elena.

34:08.393 --> 34:10.529
Hofar are you gonna take this?

34:10.530 --> 34:12.884
Are you trying to make me
feel bad for hurting your mom?

34:12.885 --> 34:17.402
Don't you get it?
I don't care.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.572
I mean, maybe you should
try to turn it all off.

34:20.572 --> 34:24.060
Who knows? You might stop whining
about how Tyler left you.

34:24.061 --> 34:25.177
An added bonus:

34:25.178 --> 34:26.712
You won't have to feel guilty

34:26.713 --> 34:28.130
about all the dirty thoughts
you have about Klaus.

34:28.130 --> 34:29.130
Shut up.

34:29.130 --> 34:30.985
Make me.

34:35.938 --> 34:38.273
You fight like a girl.

34:38.784 --> 34:39.940
Uh!

34:46.958 --> 34:48.100
Let go of me!

34:48.101 --> 34:50.452
I admit,
under any other circumstances,

34:50.453 --> 34:52.036
this would be a major turn-on.

34:52.038 --> 34:53.603
Get her out of here.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.539
Hey, Tyler.
It's me.

35:10.540 --> 35:13.458
You'll never believe
the crazy day I've had.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.044
Look, I know that
you said you wouldn't,

35:15.045 --> 35:18.464
but I really wish
that you would answer.

35:18.465 --> 35:21.283
It would be great to talk to you.

35:27.122 --> 35:29.791
You all right?

35:29.792 --> 35:34.196
Besides the fact that my best
friend tried to kill me?

35:34.197 --> 35:36.969
Look, it's not her.
You have to remember that.

35:36.970 --> 35:42.121
With her emotions off,
she's the worst version of herself.

35:42.122 --> 35:44.189
So how do we get her back?

35:44.190 --> 35:45.691
Or what if we can't?

35:45.692 --> 35:48.444
Why would she choose to
turn her emotions back on?

35:48.445 --> 35:51.280
She's an orphan.
She just lost her brother.

35:51.281 --> 35:54.500
Her life sucks, Stefan.

35:54.501 --> 35:57.335
So why would she come back to us?

35:58.787 --> 36:03.287
Even when I was at my worst,
Elena didn't give up on me.

36:05.978 --> 36:07.916
So we can't give up on her.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.171
Deal?

36:28.183 --> 36:30.869
How much longer am
I supposed to sit here?

36:30.870 --> 36:34.540
Well, I'm not big on goal-setting,
but let's just imagine a time

36:34.541 --> 36:37.321
when you don't want to
kill your best friend.

36:37.322 --> 36:39.744
Are you judging me?

36:42.247 --> 36:45.583
How many times have you
tried to kill Stefan?

36:48.754 --> 36:50.371
What is that?

36:54.626 --> 36:56.465
One of life's many mysteries.

36:59.898 --> 37:02.601
Elena, look...
Don't.

37:02.602 --> 37:04.719
Every time someone
starts with "Elena,"

37:04.720 --> 37:06.555
I get some stupid lecture.

37:06.556 --> 37:11.360
Everyone just needs to stop
telling me that I need to feel.

37:11.361 --> 37:14.662
I do feel, Damon.
I feel amazing.

37:14.663 --> 37:17.266
You don't want to be like this.

37:17.267 --> 37:20.836
Then how should I be?

37:20.837 --> 37:22.904
Should I go back to being
the scared little girl

37:22.905 --> 37:26.575
who couldn't admit what she wants?

37:26.576 --> 37:32.381
Is that how you'd prefer me to
go back to being, or... Look.

37:32.382 --> 37:35.884
For the longest time,
you wanted to be with me,

37:35.885 --> 37:39.688
but you were scared that I'd find
out how awful you are.

37:39.689 --> 37:42.719
But it doesn't matter anymore
because I don't care.

37:46.411 --> 37:47.979
Be honest.

37:49.348 --> 37:51.687
You like me better like this.

38:06.965 --> 38:08.950
Matt?

38:08.951 --> 38:09.955
Care.

38:09.956 --> 38:12.753
Matt, why can't I get inside?

38:16.625 --> 38:18.426
Come in.

38:25.067 --> 38:27.852
Matt, what's going on?

38:29.821 --> 38:33.808
Tyler sent me
this package in the mail.

38:33.809 --> 38:35.943
This is for you.

38:38.180 --> 38:43.652
Dear care, I miss you
more than I can put into words,

38:43.653 --> 38:47.700
but I know as long as Klaus
is alive, I can't come home.

38:48.157 --> 38:51.593
He won't stop trying to kill me,

38:51.594 --> 38:53.961
and you won't stop
trying to protect me.

38:53.962 --> 38:56.465
Which means the only way to
make sure you're safe is for me

38:56.466 --> 39:00.102
to go and never come back.

39:00.103 --> 39:02.437
I left Matt the deed to the house.

39:02.438 --> 39:05.510
It will protect you in ways
I can't anymore.

39:05.975 --> 39:08.559
I will always love you.

39:17.919 --> 39:20.071
He's not coming back.

39:46.181 --> 39:48.849
Running away, little wolf?

39:56.481 --> 39:57.636
What?

39:57.637 --> 40:01.029
That mark.
I've seen it before.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.998
Yeah. It's a birthmark.

40:02.999 --> 40:04.402
People have those.

40:04.403 --> 40:07.419
In my considerable lifetime,
I've only seen that mark

40:07.420 --> 40:12.707
on a handful of others, all
from the same bloodline...

40:12.708 --> 40:14.209
A werewolf clan that once thrived

40:14.210 --> 40:18.763
throughout much of what
we now call Louisiana.

40:18.764 --> 40:21.794
Don't lie to me...
Not about this.

40:21.795 --> 40:24.019
I wouldn't dare.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.591
Matters of family are sacred.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.443
Tell me.

40:35.948 --> 40:38.116
Sheriff Forbes.
Everything OK?

40:38.117 --> 40:40.151
No, it's not.

40:45.119 --> 40:46.441
Hey.

40:46.442 --> 40:47.776
Where the hell are you?

40:47.777 --> 40:49.614
Out for a drive.
I need some space.

40:50.129 --> 40:51.950
It's not me. It's you.

40:51.951 --> 40:53.948
Well, we got a little problem.

40:53.949 --> 40:56.301
You said blood was stolen
from grove hill's hospital.

40:56.302 --> 40:59.087
The sheriff said there's been reports
of 6 other blood bank thefts

40:59.088 --> 41:01.456
all within 30 Miles
of Mystic Falls.

41:01.457 --> 41:02.919
Somebody's stockpiling blood.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.299
It wasn't Elena, and it's not us.

41:07.300 --> 41:13.299
OK, so... I think Silas followed
us back from that island.

41:14.140 --> 41:18.190
Hasn't fed in 2,000 years, so he
would need to gorge on blood.

41:18.191 --> 41:19.641
It explains the thefts.

41:19.642 --> 41:22.110
You know, I'm really not in the
mood to Scooby Doo our way

41:22.111 --> 41:23.912
through the case
of the stolen blood supply,

41:23.913 --> 41:26.114
so why don't you hold
the fort down until I get back,

41:26.115 --> 41:28.148
and I'll be in touch, brother.

41:31.002 --> 41:32.287
He's gonna hate you for that.

41:32.288 --> 41:35.924
Yeah, well, emotions are overrated.

41:35.925 --> 41:37.125
So where are we going?

41:37.126 --> 41:41.374
A place every newbie vampire should
go at least once in their life...

41:41.881 --> 41:43.876
New York.

41:43.877 --> 41:47.134
The city that never sleeps.
