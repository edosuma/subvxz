[birdsong]

00:12.125 --> 00:13.791
[Roach whickering]

00:22.541 --> 00:23.916
How much further is it?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.291
Where are we even going?

00:35.291 --> 00:37.291
At least at Kaer Morhen, we were safe.

00:37.916 --> 00:40.000
The Trial of Grasses isn't safe.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.375
Not listening again.

00:44.750 --> 00:45.750
Hmph.

00:46.416 --> 00:49.083
You want to kill yourself
trying to become a mutant

00:49.625 --> 00:50.916
so if you survive,

00:51.625 --> 00:54.166
you can kill yourself
trying to get revenge.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.875
Which part did I miss?

00:57.916 --> 00:59.166
[Roach snorting]

01:01.583 --> 01:04.250
You don't really give a shit
about what I want.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.250
All you care about is your…

01:09.291 --> 01:11.083
-damn duty.
-[Roach snorts]

01:12.541 --> 01:14.958
So long as I'm breathing,
you've done your part.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.791
I need more than that.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.166
Ciri…

01:27.875 --> 01:29.291
I do understand.

01:31.708 --> 01:33.333
[Roach whickers]

01:33.416 --> 01:34.708
[Ciri] What's up there?

01:35.708 --> 01:37.541
Do you- do you hear something?

01:38.333 --> 01:39.500
Come on, Roach.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.291
Let's go.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.000
This is the shallowest part of the river.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.416
I'll check that it's safe to cross.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.666
[Ciri] What do you mean, safe?

01:53.666 --> 01:55.250
I'll try and draw it out first.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.541
[Ciri] Draw what out?

01:57.625 --> 02:00.125
-[Geralt] It's some kind of chernobog.
-I don't know what that is.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.333
-But let me help--
-Stay here.

03:05.541 --> 03:07.375
[sighs and grumbles]

03:11.166 --> 03:12.708
I've been a fucking fool.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.125
Where are they?

03:16.291 --> 03:17.500
They didn't say.

03:18.708 --> 03:20.750
If I had to guess, Nenneke's.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.958
We've both been fools.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.541
Whatever's running
through that girl's veins…

03:28.625 --> 03:29.833
[sighs]

03:29.916 --> 03:31.458
…whatever we made from it…

03:33.416 --> 03:35.375
it's more dangerous than we know.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.875
[rattling]

03:38.000 --> 03:39.125
What's wrong?

03:39.916 --> 03:40.791
Vesemir.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.208
-Someone is here.
-What is it?

03:44.750 --> 03:45.708
What's happened?

03:46.291 --> 03:47.416
-Who's here?
-[groans]

03:51.500 --> 03:52.583
[grunts]

03:53.541 --> 03:54.583
Surprise.

03:58.541 --> 04:00.125
[speaking in Elder]

04:03.125 --> 04:04.458
How quaint.

04:45.666 --> 04:47.750
[Ciri] Shh.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.333
[Geralt] Easy, girl.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.375
-Is there anything we can do?
-[sighs]

05:06.208 --> 05:07.333
[Roach snorts softly]

05:12.458 --> 05:14.833
Enjoy your last walk across the meadow

05:15.500 --> 05:16.875
and through the mist.

05:16.958 --> 05:18.416
[wheezing]

05:19.375 --> 05:20.916
Be not afraid of her…

05:23.291 --> 05:24.791

05:47.041 --> 05:48.375
It's time.

05:54.750 --> 05:55.958
Are you ready for this?

05:57.041 --> 05:58.083
Yes.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.250
Go up to the rock.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.166
[sighs]

06:19.208 --> 06:21.416

06:48.791 --> 06:49.666

06:52.458 --> 06:54.083
[intense rumbling]

06:54.708 --> 06:56.416

07:24.583 --> 07:26.291
Where the fuck are my swords?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.333
[birdsong]

07:45.833 --> 07:47.750
[laughter]

07:48.625 --> 07:50.083
[Francesca whispers]

07:54.500 --> 07:55.833
It's beautiful.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.416
Never seen a spell like it.

08:01.291 --> 08:05.000
My favorite thing to do as a girl
was flower picking with my mother.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.875
After she died,
I kept one to remember her by.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.500
One day, it started to wilt.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.041
When I held that flower,

08:14.500 --> 08:18.250
I don't know why exactly,
but I began to feel warm inside.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.666
And the flower bloomed again.

08:24.291 --> 08:27.000
I did that spell over and over for years,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.541
until my father caught me.

08:30.125 --> 08:33.166
That's when he tried to lead the village
in a crusade against me.

08:33.708 --> 08:34.791
But he failed.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.250
Gage held him down
while I slit his throat.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.666
The village built a statue in my honor.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.458
At Aretuza,

08:48.625 --> 08:50.750
they taught us the art of politics.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.666
The art of persuasion.

08:53.875 --> 08:57.416
A quick tongue to bend others
so they think that they're in control.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.958
Like with your friend Cahir?

09:04.791 --> 09:06.500
You're different with him around.

09:07.041 --> 09:09.541
Not afraid, perhaps, but smaller.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.375
-He was my superior.
-Was?

09:12.958 --> 09:14.541
Because you bent him to believe so?

09:16.041 --> 09:18.666
It's time for him
to stop thinking he's in power.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.333
To know you are.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.583
The White Flame rules Nilfgaard.

09:22.666 --> 09:23.958
-[horse neighs]
-[Francesca] Yes.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.041
But my people,

09:26.125 --> 09:28.666
the face they see
that feeds them every day,

09:28.750 --> 09:31.583
that welcomes them in
from the cold, is yours.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.125
That is worth something.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.333
[whinnying]

09:52.833 --> 09:55.541
In times of war,
hard decisions must be made.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.375
I don't begrudge you yours.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.916
The persecution of the elves
is despicable.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.625
I know you well enough to understand

10:10.500 --> 10:14.083
that you did not forsake
the mission the White Flame gave us.

10:14.708 --> 10:15.875
You just got a little…

10:17.208 --> 10:18.416
distracted.

10:20.416 --> 10:24.458
It is time to return to the real reason
that we took Cintra in the first place.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.083
The girl was last seen in Sodden,
I'm told.

10:38.666 --> 10:39.708
[bird shrieking]

10:39.791 --> 10:41.166
[flies buzzing]

10:41.833 --> 10:45.458
[Ciri] I'm sorry. About Roach.
About all of this…

10:45.541 --> 10:47.958
[Geralt] Don't be. I'm proud of you, Ciri.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.041
What you did back there was courageous.

10:51.958 --> 10:53.625
[Ciri] I had that feeling again

10:54.208 --> 10:55.833
when the chernobog came for me.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.458
The pull.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.583
But I… I don't think it wanted to hurt me.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.666
It didn't want to hurt you?

11:08.750 --> 11:10.208
Hmm. [sighs]

11:12.333 --> 11:16.125
[Ciri] If the monsters are coming
through the monoliths, it's my fault.

11:16.916 --> 11:18.250
[Geralt] It's not that simple.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.500
Geralt?

11:24.666 --> 11:26.208
When the Knight caught me,

11:26.666 --> 11:28.166
all I could feel was fear.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.958
I was… I was so scared.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.666
But I also felt…

11:33.916 --> 11:34.833
anger.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.166
Later, there were also some men
from Cintra who found me.

11:40.208 --> 11:43.708
They were going to take me to the Knight
to collect a reward.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.791
But I-- I wasn't scared that time.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.583
I just… I knew what could happen.

11:52.291 --> 11:53.250
You screamed.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.666
I killed them, Geralt.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.000
How many were there?

11:59.500 --> 12:00.333
Four.

12:00.833 --> 12:01.875
Only four?

12:02.541 --> 12:03.916
You've got some catching up to do.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.791
[Ciri] So, what now?

12:12.291 --> 12:13.500
[Geralt] Good question.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.666
I'm hoping we'll find our answers there.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.291
Melitele.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.375
Goddess of fertility and harvest.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.333
I'm impressed.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.458
I do, in fact, read.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.666
The graduates of the temple school

12:53.750 --> 12:57.583
are known to become midwives,
historians, healers…

12:57.666 --> 12:58.666
And witchers.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.791
Vesemir sent me here
when I was about your age.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.416
It's where witchers learn to do signs.

13:06.791 --> 13:09.833
Yes. I, too, was once a child.

13:12.916 --> 13:14.708
[woman] Blessings. Good morrow.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.083
Where is she taking those?

13:20.416 --> 13:21.916
Don't worry. We're safe.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.291
There's no fighting here. No politics.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.458
The temple is known for its neutrality.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.666
The temple is

13:30.208 --> 13:31.750
what you make of it.

13:32.875 --> 13:33.791
But, yes,

13:35.000 --> 13:39.041
some find it more… giving than others.

13:40.791 --> 13:43.958
I have missed you.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.916
I have missed you too, Nenneke.

13:49.708 --> 13:50.541
Now,

13:51.500 --> 13:53.583
who are you?

13:58.250 --> 14:00.875
I think we can, at the very least,

14:01.333 --> 14:05.000
start to guide you
in the art of controlling your Chaos.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.000
What's that?

14:06.458 --> 14:08.416
It's the feeling inside.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.875
The feeling you can't control.

14:12.916 --> 14:13.750
Like…

14:14.375 --> 14:16.000
the Daughter of Chaos?

14:18.208 --> 14:19.750
Where did you hear that?

14:24.291 --> 14:25.333
Ciri,

14:26.416 --> 14:28.458
the questions you are asking

14:28.541 --> 14:30.875
require knowledge
that's been lost to time.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.041
And knowledge like that

14:34.125 --> 14:36.333
is usually lost for a reason.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.583
Are you sure you're ready?

14:41.708 --> 14:44.416
Whatever… gave me this Chaos,

14:45.333 --> 14:46.958
hiding from it won't fix it.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.541
I'm ready for the truth,
whatever it takes.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.833
That spirit. [sighs]

14:54.916 --> 14:56.208
You're just like him.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.750
-[chuckles]
-Geralt?

14:58.916 --> 14:59.791
Ask him

15:00.833 --> 15:03.625
to tell you about the Aard incident.

15:03.708 --> 15:07.041
It nearly destroyed
the very office we are sitting in.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.916
Ah! This is Jarre.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.875
One of our best students.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.375
Pleasure to meet you, milady.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.250
Mi-magical lady.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.375
-[Ciri chuckles]
-Whatever it takes.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.708
Ah, Jarre, take Ciri to the library.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.041
She's in dire need of the orbuculum.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.500
[chuckles]

15:35.375 --> 15:36.375
[whispers] Help me.

15:36.458 --> 15:37.500
Hmm.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.250
Now that you've had a chance
to speak with her, what do you think?

15:46.750 --> 15:50.916
I don't see any side
upon which you are not entirely fucked.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.041
[sighs]

15:52.125 --> 15:53.791
She's a princess.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.458
Kingdoms will want her for her status.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.166
Nilfgaard already does.

15:58.708 --> 16:02.000
You know how many have been killed
in pursuit of her?

16:02.083 --> 16:04.000
Thousands, yes, I know.

16:04.083 --> 16:05.708
And if she has Elder blood,

16:06.541 --> 16:08.333
she's a fucking tinderbox.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.708
By all means, go on.

16:10.291 --> 16:14.583
You said she recited Ithlinne's Prophecy
during one of her episodes.

16:14.708 --> 16:18.125
Yes, but I won't let what may
or may not be folklore dictate my path.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.916
What does she know of the Wild Hunt?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.583
She believes what most people believe.
What are you driving at, Nenneke?

16:24.833 --> 16:27.291
She's a Child of Destiny.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.333
[sighs]

16:28.416 --> 16:31.083
There are forces at play
larger than we know.

16:31.916 --> 16:34.291
You are a part of her,

16:34.791 --> 16:36.458
she a part of you.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.000
But it's not enough.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.333
I know.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.583
[sighs]

16:46.000 --> 16:47.333
What can I do?

16:49.125 --> 16:50.333
I taught you

16:51.375 --> 16:52.958
in all things…

16:53.750 --> 16:55.125
-balance.
-[sighs]

16:56.208 --> 16:58.500
Find what is missing in the girl.

16:58.583 --> 16:59.916
Then, maybe,

17:00.958 --> 17:03.166
you stand a chance of helping her.

17:04.416 --> 17:05.750
-[sighs]
-Hmm?

17:12.416 --> 17:13.541
[sighs]

17:21.583 --> 17:22.833
[sighs]

17:33.375 --> 17:35.208
I hope training is going well.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.833
Our people have lived
in the mountains long enough.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.250
They know how to kill.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.083
They know how to defend.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.708
Can they learn how to kill first?

17:45.791 --> 17:46.833
[sighs]

17:48.500 --> 17:50.000
Imagine a time when we can return

17:50.750 --> 17:52.875
to valuing… beauty.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.750
The land, and life.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.416
Death is a part of life.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.750
Perhaps that is the cost
of getting our land back.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.291
Do you believe it will happen?

18:08.541 --> 18:10.291
Something's shifted in the air, Francesca.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.708
Since that soldier arrived.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.500
-I know.
-Everything feels more vulnerable.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.125
Including Fringilla.

18:19.833 --> 18:20.875
I'm taking care of it.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.875
I was skeptical,

18:24.416 --> 18:26.041
I'll be the first to admit, but…

18:28.208 --> 18:30.333
I'm not here to tell you what to do.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.458
I'm here to ask what you need of me.

18:34.833 --> 18:36.750
I will greet
the elves who arrive on boats.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.958
I will train them in human warfare.

18:41.166 --> 18:44.041
I'll don Nilfgaardian armor
if it's what's important.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.375
Whatever you need.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.875
I need you to stay by my side.

18:57.750 --> 18:58.583
I will.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.083
By our side.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.208
Where you belong.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.958
She is what's most important now.

19:11.333 --> 19:12.583
-[sighs]
-[gasps]

19:15.416 --> 19:17.416
[wind howling]

19:30.458 --> 19:31.625
[sighs]

19:32.916 --> 19:33.833
How's Vesemir?

19:34.458 --> 19:35.375
Stable.

19:36.125 --> 19:37.000
But shaken.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.791
What I can't figure is,

19:40.333 --> 19:43.291
what would a mage want with Vesemir?

19:45.291 --> 19:47.291
Well, why don't we ask the expert?

19:48.458 --> 19:51.375
What business
could one of your kind have here,

19:52.458 --> 19:53.833
Merigold?

19:53.916 --> 19:55.958
That bastard is not one of my kind.

19:58.875 --> 20:02.291
Oh, fuck me. I was only poking.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.625
Fire magic is off-limits for us.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.541
Whoever he is,
he's not working for the Brotherhood.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.000
If you say so.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.291
And I don't think
Vesemir is what he was after.

20:17.541 --> 20:20.208
Well, at least he left empty-handed.
[grunts]

20:21.250 --> 20:22.166
Fuck…

20:28.166 --> 20:30.166
[Lydia] You're sure it contains her blood?

20:32.500 --> 20:33.666
[sighs]

20:33.750 --> 20:35.250
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.583
This wasn't part of our arrangement.

20:38.666 --> 20:40.833
We arranged for you to bring me the girl.

20:41.416 --> 20:42.375
You fucked that up.

20:43.583 --> 20:44.750
Here we are, then.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.208
Oh, dear. What--

20:48.833 --> 20:49.916
Get out.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.458
I was saying, it's a work in progress.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.208
But…

21:01.916 --> 21:04.208
perhaps the terms of our deal
can be updated?

21:04.291 --> 21:05.375
What do you want?

21:05.458 --> 21:07.166
-To meet your employer.
-[scoffs]

21:08.375 --> 21:12.458
My lord is a private man. Why should you
give two shits about meeting him?

21:12.541 --> 21:15.916
He seemed like a man with vision.
I'd like to help him see it through.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.125
What's that old saying?

21:19.958 --> 21:22.833
Better to be at the right hand
of the devil than in his path.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.541
I'll see what I can do.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.416
Now… [sighs]

21:27.500 --> 21:31.625
…you expect to get out of that temple
with the rest of your face intact?

21:35.208 --> 21:36.750
-You'll need a crew.
-Hmm.

21:37.916 --> 21:40.541
I know some particularly savage brothers.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.583
[dog barking]

21:48.333 --> 21:49.875
[bell clanking]

21:49.958 --> 21:51.708
[laughter and conversation]

22:18.208 --> 22:19.291
Hello?

22:19.375 --> 22:20.541
[meows]

22:20.625 --> 22:22.625
[growling]

22:26.000 --> 22:27.125
Hello?

22:29.250 --> 22:30.916
Tss, tss, tss.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.291
[yowls]

22:36.041 --> 22:37.583
[growling]

22:40.375 --> 22:42.291
You're lucky the trap's broken.

22:42.875 --> 22:48.333
Usually, it shoots 20-inch metal spikes
out the studs.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.625
Got a hawker a few nights ago.

22:51.708 --> 22:54.583
I can still hear his screams.

22:55.333 --> 22:58.500
-That's, uh… that's chilling.
-Yeah.

23:00.125 --> 23:03.625
-I take it you are Ellis Codringher.
-Mm, mm.

23:04.125 --> 23:05.958
-My name is Istredd.
-Mmm?

23:07.166 --> 23:10.416
So this is Hen Gedymdeith's
Elves and Humans?

23:10.500 --> 23:12.541
All copies were thought lost.

23:12.666 --> 23:15.750
Yeah, well, we have a great number

23:15.833 --> 23:19.958
of lost works
of literature and texts here.

23:20.041 --> 23:23.791
That's one reason
why our services come at a premium.

23:24.291 --> 23:27.666
Now, you were saying you are in need of…

23:28.375 --> 23:30.000
[inhales] Yes, um…

23:31.125 --> 23:32.125
I need information.

23:32.208 --> 23:35.000
Oh, right, oh. Information. Mmm.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.333
[chuckles]

23:37.125 --> 23:41.041
Uh, information is power.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.708
And in the wrong hands,
it can be a weapon.

23:44.666 --> 23:46.833
Tell me, are you acting

23:46.916 --> 23:49.500
on behalf of Stregobor?

23:49.583 --> 23:50.625
[cat hisses]

23:50.708 --> 23:52.166
Don't lie to me.

23:52.666 --> 23:53.708
No, I'm not.

23:54.916 --> 23:55.750
And…

23:56.958 --> 23:58.458
how do you know who I am?

23:58.541 --> 24:00.791
We know lots of things.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.208
-We?
-[cat meows]

24:02.291 --> 24:04.208
[purring]

24:04.708 --> 24:05.875
-This is Fenn?
-[purring]

24:05.958 --> 24:06.791
[woman chuckles]

24:06.875 --> 24:08.208
-[Codringher laughs]
-[ruimbling]

24:09.000 --> 24:11.708
I'm Fenn. The cat's Esmeralda.

24:13.208 --> 24:16.291
What kind of information
are you looking for?

24:17.500 --> 24:18.750
[Istredd] Well, uh…

24:18.833 --> 24:21.791
I've heard a great many things
about you both, namely…

24:22.958 --> 24:24.708
you're who to ask, uh…

24:25.583 --> 24:26.666
sensitive questions.

24:26.750 --> 24:29.291
Sensitive questions are our favorite.

24:29.416 --> 24:32.458
-They come very expensive.
-[whispers] Very expensive!

24:32.958 --> 24:35.083
Well, I need to know what a witcher,

24:35.208 --> 24:39.083
a monolith, and a mysterious girl
have to do with Nilfgaard.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.041
[mumbles]

24:50.166 --> 24:51.166
Will this do?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.291
These are Nilfgaardian marks.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.291
Do you work for them?

25:01.833 --> 25:02.750
Does it matter?

25:03.333 --> 25:06.083
Only that it makes you more… interesting.

25:10.916 --> 25:13.500
The girl is Cirilla of Cintra.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.000
And how do you know that?

25:16.083 --> 25:18.125
-Hmph.
-Like I told you,

25:18.958 --> 25:20.583
we know lots of things.

25:22.416 --> 25:25.083
-[Ciri] So do you work here or something?
-[Jarre] Me? Um…

25:25.166 --> 25:27.666
[chuckles] I'm a historian. In training.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.458
You'll need this to begin your studies.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.458
Is this the orbuculum?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.500
-What does it do, exactly?
-Uh…

25:38.125 --> 25:39.458
I-- I'm not sure.

25:40.458 --> 25:41.833
Not much of a historian.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.250
Uh-- [chuckles]

25:43.333 --> 25:46.250
Well-- well, that's a tool for mages.

25:47.791 --> 25:52.250
Uh… I don't want to brag,
but my tool is… bigger.

25:53.208 --> 25:54.791
And much more powerful.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.416
Uh… Knowledge.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.333
Like this book. It--
it's about all sorts of amazing things,

26:04.416 --> 26:08.708
like, um… did you know that
some oneiromancers can relive past events

26:08.791 --> 26:10.583
just by looking at a painting?

26:10.666 --> 26:14.083
Or, and-- and this is my favorite,
there's a myth about a long-lost tower

26:14.166 --> 26:16.500
somewhere on the Continent
that used to connect to the Isle--

26:16.583 --> 26:17.458
-[thump]
-Sorry.

26:18.458 --> 26:19.333
Uh…

26:20.875 --> 26:23.250
Your big old tool almost broke my toe.

26:29.333 --> 26:31.125
Thank you for walking me here.

26:31.916 --> 26:33.791
I'm going to go and practice now.

26:36.166 --> 26:37.333
Whatever this is.

26:39.791 --> 26:41.041
[soft whooshing]

26:43.666 --> 26:46.791
[Deathless Mother, echoing] Find me.

26:47.416 --> 26:51.583
Steal me.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.541
[voices whispering]

27:00.500 --> 27:02.041
Oh. Uh, can I help you?

27:02.125 --> 27:04.666
No. No, I was--
I was just admiring the architecture.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.083
Oh. It's beautiful, isn't it?

27:19.541 --> 27:20.916
[Ciri's voice, muffled]

27:33.500 --> 27:34.333
Fuck.

27:43.250 --> 27:44.916
[door opens]

27:45.833 --> 27:47.416
Be with you in a minute, Ciri.

28:07.833 --> 28:08.750
[gasps]

28:11.125 --> 28:12.625
How is this possible?

28:13.250 --> 28:14.291
I don't care.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.833
Geralt, do you know what to do with this?

28:36.916 --> 28:37.750
-Sorry.
-Ciri.

28:37.833 --> 28:39.833
-[whispers] Sorry.
-[Geralt] This is my…

28:41.125 --> 28:42.541
uh, dear friend.

28:44.375 --> 28:45.500
Dear friend?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.458
[Geralt sighs]

28:49.833 --> 28:51.041
This is Yennefer.

28:52.833 --> 28:53.833
You're Yennefer?

28:54.875 --> 28:56.125
And you must be his…

28:57.375 --> 28:58.750
Child Surprise.

29:08.666 --> 29:11.375
[Hake] Fucking pointies think
they can join our ranks.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.583
Fringilla's lost her mind.

29:13.666 --> 29:15.583
Thank the gods you came back when you did.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.958
[Cahir] The elves have endured much,
and Nilfgaard has given them a haven.

29:19.041 --> 29:21.750
Loyalty seems an easy return
on the investment.

29:22.416 --> 29:23.750
Loyalty to whom?

29:24.416 --> 29:26.791
This isn't the White Flame's doing,
you know?

29:26.875 --> 29:28.708
This is all Fringilla.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.125
You hold your sword like this.
Yes, like this.

29:32.208 --> 29:33.500
That? Yes? Like this.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.625
So when they come with an attack… Hah!

29:38.083 --> 29:40.250
Ready to defend yourself, yes? Good!

29:40.333 --> 29:43.416
Perhaps a proper demonstration
would help your ward?

29:45.250 --> 29:47.625
-You don't have to fight him, Dara.
-[Cahir] Not fighting.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.375
We're all on the same side.

29:51.000 --> 29:51.833
[grunts]

29:51.916 --> 29:53.750
-[sighs]
-[Cahir] Don't you remember?

29:54.833 --> 29:55.666
Come!

29:59.250 --> 30:00.375
Trust yourself.

30:07.625 --> 30:08.458
Come.

30:18.541 --> 30:20.958
[Cahir grunting]

30:26.125 --> 30:28.250
-You fight like fairies!
-Impossible!

30:29.166 --> 30:31.375
-Your kind killed them all.
-[Gage] Filavandrel!

30:32.750 --> 30:34.208
The baby, it's early!

30:35.208 --> 30:37.208
-You're a lucky human.
-[chuckles]

30:48.833 --> 30:51.333
[Ciri] You really expect me to believe
that unicorns exist?

30:51.416 --> 30:53.166
[Yennefer] Of course they do.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.958
[Ciri] I used to own a stuffed one.

30:55.041 --> 30:56.083
Until it broke.

30:56.916 --> 30:59.083
Under mysterious circumstances.

31:01.333 --> 31:04.375
Well, I'd love to see one some day.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.750
[Geralt] You'd be in rare company.

31:06.833 --> 31:09.458
They only approach
those who are pure of heart.

31:10.541 --> 31:11.666
Which reminds me,

31:12.500 --> 31:14.166
how did you get your hands on one?

31:14.250 --> 31:15.791
Good sir!

31:15.875 --> 31:17.291
I'm a beacon of purity.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.208
[chuckles]

31:24.416 --> 31:25.458
How…

31:26.083 --> 31:28.291
did you survive in Sodden?

31:29.166 --> 31:31.875
I almost didn't.
I'm one of the lucky ones.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.416
Depending on your definition of luck.

31:36.666 --> 31:40.125
Well, Geralt says you're
the most powerful mage he's ever known.

31:41.208 --> 31:42.750
Well, that's nice of him.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.041
You're staying here to heal?

31:48.375 --> 31:50.041
Have you been injured or something?

31:50.125 --> 31:51.166
Of course not.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.875
Monsters ceased biting and clawing
ten years ago.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.166
But what about you?

31:57.541 --> 31:59.791
I crossed paths with another of your, uh…

32:00.916 --> 32:02.041
dear friends.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.541
He told me what happened at Aretuza.

32:07.916 --> 32:09.250
Is that why you're here?

32:09.875 --> 32:11.458
Hiding from the Brotherhood?

32:13.625 --> 32:14.500
Yes.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.625
It's been a difficult few months.

32:19.541 --> 32:22.291
But things finally seem
to be turning a corner.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.125
I… dreamed about you once.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.791
Before I even knew you existed.

32:33.791 --> 32:35.416
Dreams are powerful omens.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.375
Perhaps we were meant to find each other.

32:48.541 --> 32:49.583
Um…

32:50.291 --> 32:52.833
I'm going to go to bed.

32:53.958 --> 32:55.583
Maybe I can…

32:56.166 --> 32:58.708
dream about how to work this thing.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.125
This place is a maze. I'll walk you.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.541
No, it's-- it's all right.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.125
I can, uh…

33:05.916 --> 33:07.125
find my way.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.666
[gasping]

33:15.750 --> 33:17.750
-[woman] Come on! Push!
-[Filavandrel] Come on!

33:17.833 --> 33:20.083
-[groans]
-[woman] Go on. Come on, push.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.750
-[moaning]
-[Fringilla] Come on.

33:25.125 --> 33:28.208
-You can do this.
-All I want is for this baby to live.

33:29.166 --> 33:30.375
To have a life.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.416
All you have to do is push.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.833
-Push!
-Do it again.

33:36.375 --> 33:38.375
-Come on.
-[screams]

33:40.333 --> 33:42.166
-[sighs]
-[midwife] That's it. It's over.

33:44.916 --> 33:46.375
She isn't breathing.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.625
Quick!

33:47.708 --> 33:49.708
Come on, little one. Come on.

33:53.375 --> 33:54.583
-Come on.
-What's going on?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.083
-What is it?
-Sh, sh, sh. It's okay.

33:57.666 --> 33:59.416
Come on. [gasping]

34:01.833 --> 34:04.250
-Oh!
-[Francesca] Why isn't she crying?

34:05.458 --> 34:06.666
[whispers] Come on.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.125
Come on.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.208
-What's-- what's going on?
-Shh, it's okay.

34:10.291 --> 34:12.166
[Fringilla] Breathe. Breathe.

34:13.708 --> 34:15.875
-Come on.
-[baby splutters]

34:16.666 --> 34:17.750
[whimpers

34:17.833 --> 34:19.833
-[crying]
-[gasps]

34:20.666 --> 34:22.625
-Oh! Ohh!
-[crying loudly]

34:22.708 --> 34:24.416
-[midwife laughs]
-Oh!

34:33.916 --> 34:35.125
How?

34:37.916 --> 34:41.958
[Filavandrel laughing]

34:42.541 --> 34:45.500
How? How, how, how?
Was it dark magic? Necromancy? What?

34:45.583 --> 34:46.500
No magic.

34:47.458 --> 34:49.083
-Just warmth.
-[gasping]

34:49.708 --> 34:51.333
-Just warmth.
-Oh!

34:54.791 --> 34:56.791
[both laughing]

35:01.291 --> 35:02.708
[sighs]

35:04.291 --> 35:05.958
A new elf was born this night.

35:06.041 --> 35:08.041
[loud cheering]

35:22.625 --> 35:26.916
Geralt know you're out
roaming my halls unsupervised?

35:28.250 --> 35:29.916
Does he need to know?

35:30.791 --> 35:31.958
[chuckles]

35:34.833 --> 35:36.041
What's all this for?

35:37.208 --> 35:40.625
To welcome late stragglers
who seek refuge.

35:42.083 --> 35:43.875
And sometimes, I…

35:44.833 --> 35:47.541
I light them to remember those I've lost.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.000
Can I help?

35:53.166 --> 35:54.208
Of course.

36:02.083 --> 36:04.083
To Myrrha.

36:12.083 --> 36:13.333
For Roach.

36:23.166 --> 36:24.333
For Mousesack.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.666
Mousesack?

36:30.250 --> 36:31.333
Who is that?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
He, um…

36:35.166 --> 36:37.166
he died trying to protect me.

36:39.291 --> 36:43.583
Then he must have loved you very much.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.375
Yes.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.291
I just…

36:50.500 --> 36:53.291
wish he would have told me what I am.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.500
Not one of them did.

37:00.041 --> 37:01.541
Not until Geralt.

37:04.041 --> 37:07.041
Sometimes,
our elders set out to protect us,

37:07.875 --> 37:11.083
not knowing our strength.

37:13.041 --> 37:15.250
-My grandmother was strong.
-Hmm!

37:15.333 --> 37:16.541
Brave.

37:17.625 --> 37:19.000
Never hid from anything.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.583
She loved me more than anything.

37:27.833 --> 37:30.916
But she hated elves.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.458
Hatred is an endless circle
of fear and desperation.

37:39.333 --> 37:41.708
And who can tell which came first?

37:43.708 --> 37:49.375
Perhaps your grandmother's hypocrisy
was rooted in something honest?

37:50.208 --> 37:53.000
A desire to protect you.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.000
[scoffs]

37:55.083 --> 37:57.416
-Well, she did a shit job of that.
-[chuckles]

38:00.041 --> 38:04.750
Your true power resides
in more than your blood, Ciri.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.708
With the right guidance,

38:08.208 --> 38:13.000
you may have the ability
to break this cycle of hatred,

38:13.666 --> 38:14.625
once and for all.

38:16.666 --> 38:18.041
Do you really believe that?

38:19.833 --> 38:21.166
Remains to be seen.

38:23.291 --> 38:26.916
[sighs] Only a hundred more candles to go.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.041
In… [clicks tongue] that direction.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.916
What am I supposed to do with this thing?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.458
I can't figure it out.

38:39.333 --> 38:42.333
Geralt believes in you.

38:44.125 --> 38:45.416
I do too.

39:06.833 --> 39:08.250
[Filavandrel laughs]

39:09.083 --> 39:10.500
[baby cooing]

39:11.666 --> 39:12.791
[sighs]

39:13.541 --> 39:15.916
-Mmm.
-[baby cries]

39:16.916 --> 39:18.083
[laughs]

39:18.708 --> 39:20.791
-[chuckles]
-[speaking in Elder]

39:22.166 --> 39:24.541
Yes. Our little love.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.708
Mmm.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.375
[kisses]

39:28.458 --> 39:29.708
[crowd cheering outside]

39:29.791 --> 39:31.791
[laughing]

39:32.708 --> 39:33.791
[girl] Come on!

39:34.333 --> 39:36.041
[crowd cheering and laughing]

39:36.750 --> 39:38.791
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

39:40.125 --> 39:41.375
So joyous.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.416
[raucous laughter]

39:44.083 --> 39:45.083
Only once.

39:46.375 --> 39:49.500
After the Usurper was overthrown
and the people rose up.

39:49.583 --> 39:51.458
[drumming and cheering]

39:51.541 --> 39:55.291
It took me a while to be freed.
And to feel anything at all, really.

39:57.583 --> 39:58.791
And look at you now.

40:00.041 --> 40:01.291
You gave them this.

40:03.541 --> 40:04.541
Hope.

40:07.666 --> 40:12.708
But I can't help but wonder
what this hope will do to your alliance.

40:15.041 --> 40:18.458
What happens when the elves decide
they can repopulate on their own,

40:19.125 --> 40:20.833
without Nilfgaard's help?

40:25.416 --> 40:26.500
I hope…

40:27.500 --> 40:28.416
I'm wrong.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.541
Truly.

40:37.708 --> 40:39.208
The White Flame wrote you.

40:44.708 --> 40:46.375
How soon should we expect him?

40:49.958 --> 40:51.125
Any day now.

40:52.041 --> 40:53.750
[Deathless Mother] They will take it.

40:54.875 --> 40:56.708
-[echoing] Take it…
-First your power.

40:56.791 --> 40:57.666
[echoing] Power…

40:57.750 --> 40:59.041
Then your freedom.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.083
[whispering voices echoing] Freedom…

41:02.500 --> 41:04.583
Did you think about me after Caingorn?

41:07.750 --> 41:09.000
From time to time.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.250
I fantasized about you quite a bit.

41:14.041 --> 41:15.750
That a golem was ripping my insides out?

41:15.833 --> 41:17.916
No, that your head was torn off by one.

41:18.625 --> 41:19.583
[chuckles]

41:27.041 --> 41:28.166
You hurt me.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.291
I know.

41:34.916 --> 41:36.625
You weren't alone in your pain.

41:38.083 --> 41:39.041
I know.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.875
What changed your mind
about claiming the girl?

41:43.958 --> 41:46.375
You seemed so certain
it was a mistake back then.

41:47.208 --> 41:49.458
[sighs] Many things changed my mind.

41:51.916 --> 41:53.041
You among them.

41:57.125 --> 41:58.708
I ran into Jaskier.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.416
In Oxenfurt.

42:01.416 --> 42:04.375
-He was in some trouble.
-What kind of trouble?

42:04.458 --> 42:07.750
This fire fucker was after him.
A mage. I don't know who he was.

42:08.958 --> 42:11.500
He was looking for information. About you.

42:16.875 --> 42:18.541
He's looking for Ciri.

42:18.625 --> 42:20.125
Why? What is she to him?

42:25.666 --> 42:26.750
Yen,

42:26.833 --> 42:29.500
your heart has been beating fast
this whole time.

42:30.666 --> 42:31.833
You're nervous.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.208
So?

42:36.291 --> 42:37.583
[sighs]

42:38.833 --> 42:39.916
Why are you here?

42:42.791 --> 42:44.833
I have some wounds that refuse to heal.

42:50.333 --> 42:51.958
You still want to have a child?

42:54.458 --> 42:55.458
No, it's…

42:56.083 --> 42:57.333
it's different this time.

42:58.083 --> 43:00.625
Well, let's hope
it's different for the both of us.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.333
I need to find Ciri.

43:13.875 --> 43:15.583
Uh… [mutters and sighs]

43:17.708 --> 43:21.333
Maybe there isn't any riddle after all.

43:21.416 --> 43:24.250
Some kings build statues to their vanity.

43:24.333 --> 43:27.500
Maybe the Emperor Emhyr
collects monoliths.

43:27.583 --> 43:32.583
He could want Cirilla
to have a legitimate claim to Cintra.

43:33.166 --> 43:35.583
-Unrelated facts.
-Hmm. Yes.

43:35.666 --> 43:38.291
God, it's probably pure coincidence

43:38.375 --> 43:43.333
that Emhyr wants the princess
with the secret power to shatter monoliths

43:43.416 --> 43:47.125
for her claim to a throne
that he already took by force.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.583
-Hmm.
-You know, Fenn, I-- I've been thinking.

43:50.666 --> 43:53.958
How could we get answers faster?

43:54.041 --> 43:55.416
Hmm.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.541
More sarcasm.

43:57.625 --> 43:58.958
Hmm.

43:59.041 --> 43:59.958
Ahem.

44:00.875 --> 44:05.000
There's a gene that keeps showing up
in Cintran genealogy records,

44:05.083 --> 44:07.291
-but I've never heard of it.
-Uh-- Spell it.

44:08.666 --> 44:10.083
It's, uh…

44:10.166 --> 44:12.291
Leish… Ard…

44:13.500 --> 44:17.708
Rath… Ard… Lara.

44:22.250 --> 44:24.083
-Cod, get the scroll.
-Hmm?

44:24.666 --> 44:26.125
[Fenn] Get the scroll.

44:26.208 --> 44:27.541
-Right. Uh…
-So, um…

44:28.000 --> 44:29.666
-It was the--
-This one… Hm?

44:29.750 --> 44:31.583
It looks like mostly women have it.

44:32.083 --> 44:34.583
Do you think it's a-- a misnomer, or…

44:35.916 --> 44:38.125
some kind of illness
they're trying to conceal?

44:40.833 --> 44:41.708
[Fenn] Uh--

44:42.875 --> 44:46.250
"And when the humans proved hostile,

44:46.333 --> 44:48.041
bringing death and destruction,

44:48.625 --> 44:50.791
multiplying and infesting their lands,

44:50.875 --> 44:53.500
the elves built a weapon…

44:54.500 --> 44:55.916
to destroy them."

44:58.291 --> 45:01.083
-Paerhabyn means weapon.
-Hmm.

45:02.291 --> 45:05.875
But this is praethyn,
which is more like draethyn.

45:08.125 --> 45:09.875
It's a mistranslation.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.083
The elves didn't build a weapon.

45:13.166 --> 45:15.041
They built a warrior.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.291
Lara Dorren.

45:20.291 --> 45:21.708
That's their mission.

45:22.208 --> 45:23.708
Cahir's, the emperor's…

45:24.333 --> 45:25.500
To find her.

45:26.750 --> 45:29.458
She is the reason they came to Cintra.

45:29.541 --> 45:30.875
The reason for all of this.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.916
I know because I helped Ciri escape.

45:37.125 --> 45:38.875
And then I lost her myself.

46:04.416 --> 46:06.083
"Verily I say unto you…

46:09.125 --> 46:12.000
the era of the sword and the ax is nigh."

46:13.125 --> 46:14.416
[gasps]

46:15.500 --> 46:16.833
[sighs]

46:28.250 --> 46:29.666
[creaking]

46:43.166 --> 46:44.000
Jarre?

46:44.875 --> 46:47.708
-Jarre, what happened? What happened?
-[groans]

46:47.791 --> 46:50.250
-Are you all right? Who did this?
-[groaning]

46:50.333 --> 46:51.250
-[marching]
-[wheezes]

46:54.375 --> 46:55.625
Get out. Find Geralt!

46:56.875 --> 46:58.041
[Rience] Hello, Ciri.

46:59.333 --> 47:01.791
It's so nice
to finally put a face to a name.

47:02.458 --> 47:04.833
-Have you met the Michelet brothers?
-[chuckling]

47:05.500 --> 47:09.333
I don't know who you are,
but come any closer and you'll regret it.

47:09.416 --> 47:10.458
[laughs]

47:12.250 --> 47:13.625
I think we'll take our chances.

47:13.708 --> 47:15.291
[breathing heavily]

47:27.833 --> 47:29.375
Ciri!

47:34.625 --> 47:36.750
Well, if I'd known
to follow you from Oxenfurt,

47:36.833 --> 47:39.083
it would've saved me
a spy mission to Kaer Morhen.

47:39.166 --> 47:40.500
Nice scar, shithead.

47:40.583 --> 47:41.625
Fire fucker?

47:41.750 --> 47:42.875
Unfortunately, yes.

47:44.708 --> 47:45.875
Take Ciri.

47:46.875 --> 47:48.250
I'll find you afterwards.

47:49.083 --> 47:50.208
Come on.

47:50.291 --> 47:51.875
[retreating footsteps]

47:53.750 --> 47:55.333
[Ciri gasping]

48:03.291 --> 48:04.583
There's no way out.

48:07.500 --> 48:08.708
[growls]

48:10.708 --> 48:12.208
[sighs]

48:38.291 --> 48:39.291
What do we do?

48:40.416 --> 48:41.250
I don't know.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.583
Most powerful mage
Geralt's ever known? Right.

48:44.166 --> 48:45.166
It's complicated.

48:47.333 --> 48:48.500
[yells]

49:00.833 --> 49:01.916
[yells]

49:09.041 --> 49:10.166
[yells]

49:13.541 --> 49:15.291
[rumbling]

49:15.375 --> 49:16.791
[Yennefer] This thing senses magic.

49:18.666 --> 49:19.833
And it isn't mine.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.958
[high-pitched ringing]

49:23.541 --> 49:25.666
Which means
you need to get us out of here.

49:28.833 --> 49:31.541
-How?
-I'll teach you the first thing I learned.

49:36.666 --> 49:37.833
[screams]

49:37.916 --> 49:39.208
[wails]

49:39.291 --> 49:40.500
[Yennefer] Repeat after me.

49:41.166 --> 49:42.083
[speaking in Elder]

49:42.166 --> 49:43.208
I'm afraid.

49:44.416 --> 49:46.750
[breathing shakily] Ciri, we have to try.

49:48.041 --> 49:49.041
[speaking in Elder]

49:51.250 --> 49:52.958
Lesson number one.

49:53.041 --> 49:54.250
See the outcome,

49:54.916 --> 49:55.958
make it happen.

49:56.041 --> 49:57.250
[speaking in Elder]

49:57.333 --> 49:58.958
[roaring]

50:01.958 --> 50:03.000
[repeats spell]

50:08.916 --> 50:10.750
[voices gasping and whispering]

50:12.666 --> 50:14.166
[man screams]

50:19.083 --> 50:20.083
Ciri!

50:21.583 --> 50:22.541
Yen!

50:24.041 --> 50:25.083
Stop.

50:27.375 --> 50:28.625
I wish I could.

50:33.833 --> 50:35.083
[sighs]

50:38.916 --> 50:40.291
[both retching]

50:45.541 --> 50:47.541
-Well, you did it.
-[coughs]

50:48.750 --> 50:50.208
Where the bloody hell are we?

50:59.916 --> 51:01.500
I need to tell you something.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.208
[Vesemir sighs]

51:05.208 --> 51:07.583
You should know, the-- the vial…

51:09.041 --> 51:10.125
the mutagen…

51:11.791 --> 51:12.875
It's gone.

51:16.208 --> 51:18.083
And there's somewhere I need to go.

51:24.666 --> 51:26.375
Goodbye, Vesemir.

51:33.625 --> 51:35.750
[growls softly]

51:36.708 --> 51:41.458
[Fenn] "And when the babe was born,
a field of feainnewedd sprung up."

51:41.541 --> 51:44.708
"And Lara Dorren drew her last breath,

51:44.791 --> 51:47.541
crying, 'Know this.'"

51:48.250 --> 51:53.125
"'My curse will hound your descendants
unto the tenth generation.'"

51:53.208 --> 51:57.708
"'Until the columns
of time and space tremble

51:57.791 --> 51:59.833
and open for my people.'"

51:59.916 --> 52:01.916
"'Then my vengeance

52:02.666 --> 52:03.875
will be born again.'"

52:03.958 --> 52:09.583
What? Calanthe hid her elven bloodline
because she knew what lurked in it?

52:09.666 --> 52:11.333
A generational weapon.

52:23.250 --> 52:24.541
[whooshing]

52:27.750 --> 52:28.583
Triss.

52:30.125 --> 52:31.375
What are you doing here?

52:31.458 --> 52:33.250
I am loyal to you, Tissaia.

52:33.958 --> 52:36.708
No matter what's happening
here at Aretuza, this is… [gasps]

52:36.791 --> 52:39.041
-It's bigger than that.
-What is wrong?

52:40.666 --> 52:41.833
I know for a fact

52:42.500 --> 52:45.083
a drop of her blood
could change the world.

52:46.083 --> 52:47.291
In the wrong hands,

52:48.583 --> 52:50.208
she will destroy it.
