Hey, did Fulcrum say
how long it'd be

00:18.986 --> 00:21.120
before the Empire
invades Mykapo?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.722
No, but Commander Sato
has connections here,

00:23.724 --> 00:27.126
and he said
rebel sympathizers
were eager to evacuate.

Got their sights
locked on that freighter.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.882
They've got cargo
of some kind.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.984
Maybe they're smugglers.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.319
I wonder why they're
not jumping to light speed.

So, you know Commander Sato.
He order you to come get me?

05:17.651 --> 05:21.753
We're part of his Phoenix
Squadron, a rebel group
fighting the Empire.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.857
We came here to help

like yourselves evacuate.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.393
(CHUCKLES)
What does "evacuate" mean?

05:29.929 --> 05:32.130
It means run away
like a coward.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.967
Unless you didn't notice,
we fight and make
the Empire evacuate.

05:35.969 --> 05:40.372

I'm starving.

Oh, hey, you want some?

05:47.381 --> 05:49.448
Thank you,
but we don't have time.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.183
Let me debrief you
on our plan to...

05:51.185 --> 05:53.452
How "debrief"
is this gonna be?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.887
Look, it doesn't matter.
We are not going anywhere.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.957
You can't stay here
and fight the Empire alone.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.659
What do you think
we've been doing?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.794
If we hadn't jumped in
and helped you back there...

06:02.796 --> 06:05.664
Helped us?
We had everything
under control.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.033
Didn't you see
how we chased off
that Star Destroyer?

06:08.035 --> 06:12.003
Yeah, that was
not a Star Destroyer.
It was only a transport.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.072
You're all very brave.

06:14.074 --> 06:18.744
But once the Empire
arrives in full force,
that won't matter.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.179
This is our world, and we
aren't just gonna leave

06:21.181 --> 06:23.148
so some Imperial goons
can take it.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.483
We're not gonna run.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.752
Not now, not ever.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.665
Martial law has been
declared on Mykapo,

06:40.667 --> 06:43.769
but a small pocket
of resistance continues
to be troublesome.

06:43.771 --> 06:47.406
Mykapo has no armed militia
or starfighter corps.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.509
What resistance is there
to be so troublesome?

06:50.511 --> 06:53.078
One ship calling themselves
the Iron Squadron

06:53.080 --> 06:55.113
recently attacked
an advance patrol

06:55.115 --> 06:56.715
with the aid of
this rebel vessel.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.084
Oh, the  <i> Ghost.</i>

06:59.086 --> 07:04.055
They're likely evacuating
the treasonous inhabitants
before we can arrest them.

07:04.057 --> 07:09.961
As for this Iron Squadron,
very curious.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.765
Admiral Konstantine,
go to Mykapo and lock down
the system.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.034
I will deploy
a squadron of ships.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.272
No, Admiral. I want you
to handle it yourself.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.940
A single light
cruiser should be

07:21.942 --> 07:24.109
more than sufficient
for a man of your talents.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.813
You would send me
in one ship?

07:27.815 --> 07:31.616
Unless you're not up to it.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.984
I will leave immediately.

They're not coming.
I'll tell Sato.

Let me try again.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.252
You don't have time.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.189
Their ship has no hyperdrive,
and the Empire will be back
sooner than later.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.192
Right,
but Sabine had an idea.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.596
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Chop and I can try to
fix their hyperdrive.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.965
At least that'll give them
a chance to escape.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.433
(SIGHS) Ah, all right.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.802

out of here,
soon as possible,

08:23.804 --> 08:26.137
whether you convince them
to leave or not.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.040

we're not going.

leave my home either.

I was so afraid and I...
I didn't know it.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.382

of the Empire.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.716

everything, like I did.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.155
So you understand
why we do what we do.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.058
I understand that
the Empire wants us to fight

09:20.060 --> 09:22.394
because that makes it easy
for them to destroy us.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.362
So you're saying
we should do nothing?

09:24.364 --> 09:26.598
No. I'm saying
how we choose to fight

go in quietly and get him
out of there.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.146
<i>You have</i>
<i>my gratitude, Captain.</i>

14:45.985 --> 14:48.887
Wait, you're
really going back? I'm...

14:48.889 --> 14:51.990
We are all for helping Mart,
but it's obviously a trap.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.593
If it's obviously a trap,
it's not a very good one.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.528
We were outnumbered before,

14:57.530 --> 14:58.863
but we're going back
as a team

14:58.865 --> 15:01.799
and that'll give us
and Mart a fighting chance.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.440
All right if we
tag along?

15:09.442 --> 15:11.142
We saved you both a seat.

15:27.526 --> 15:28.960
(BEEPING)

15:32.631 --> 15:34.465
Look alive, Mart.
We're back.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.367
I don't believe it.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.273
The rebel ship
known as the  <i> Ghost</i>
has reentered the system.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.976
I want to destroy
both ships at once.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.645
Do not trigger the mine
until I order it.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.485
Kanan, keep those
TIEs off us.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.154
Gooti, you ready
on that hoist?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.057
Yes, ma'am.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.625
Mart, we're coming in.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.227
Goot, the Empire attached
something onto my ship.

16:03.229 --> 16:07.131
Hmm, probably a magno-mine.
Remote detonated.
That changes things.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.901
You, big guy,
get the droids ready
to go outside.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.670
Yes, ma'am!
Come on, droids. Move it!

16:12.672 --> 16:14.839
(CHATTERING)

16:29.488 --> 16:30.989
Get ready, you two!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.625
Opening cargo bay doors.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.594
HERA: (ON COMLINK)  <i> Copy that</i>
<i>Moving into position.</i>

16:36.596 --> 16:40.264
Go!
(BOTH CHATTERING)

16:47.039 --> 16:49.240
(BEEPING)

16:53.946 --> 16:55.847
Sir, they broke off
the rescue.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.515
Perhaps they detected
the mine.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.825
SABINE: (ON COMLINK)
<i>Chop, disable the detonator.</i>
<i>The red light on top.</i>

17:07.827 --> 17:10.695
<i>R3, turn off the magnetic</i>
<i>clamp, but carefully.</i>

17:10.697 --> 17:12.964
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(CHATTERING)

17:13.565 --> 17:15.266
(CHATTERING)

17:18.637 --> 17:20.071
(BEEPING)

17:20.073 --> 17:22.540
Admiral, I've lost
the mine's signal.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.908
Well, get it back!

17:29.081 --> 17:30.982
Hey, care to let me
in on the plan?

17:30.984 --> 17:32.150
SABINE: (ON COMLINK)
<i>The droids are attaching</i>

17:32.152 --> 17:34.052
<i>the mine to one of</i>
<i>your cargo crates.</i>

17:34.054 --> 17:35.553
Ah. Ah, I get it.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.366
(RAPID BEEPING)

17:48.368 --> 17:50.701
I've reacquired
the mine's signal.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.236
Very good.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.939
The bomb is in place,
but my ship's not
going anywhere.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.774
Can your droid
get me flying again?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.743
Sorry. No time for repairs.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.945
Get the droids inside
and get ready
for a pickup.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.953
(CHITTERING)
Good job, guys.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.626
They're moving in again.
Prepare to detonate.

18:19.698 --> 18:23.301
We have them.
Detonate the mine!
I'm... I'm trying!

18:23.303 --> 18:25.269
Gooti, lock onto the ship.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.674
Aah!
(GRUNTS)

18:32.744 --> 18:36.247
Hurry! Our shields can't
take much more of this!

18:36.249 --> 18:38.983
SATO: (ON COMLINK)
<i>Captain Syndulla,</i>
<i>reinforcements have arrived.</i>

18:38.985 --> 18:40.118
Sato.

18:44.923 --> 18:48.259
Maintain fire.
We must cover those ships.

18:48.261 --> 18:52.296
SATO: (ON COMLINK)
<i>Mart, you are not alone.</i>
<i>We will get you out of this.</i>

18:52.298 --> 18:53.865
Uncle Jun.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.806
It's a rebel command ship.
Call for reinforcements!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.541
(BEEPING)

19:05.677 --> 19:06.844
Got him!

19:09.648 --> 19:13.050
Mart, get your bomb ready.
We're making a run
for that cruiser.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.257
(BEEPING)
Standing by, Captain.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.762
Will you detonate the mine?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.097
It's not responding, sir!

19:27.633 --> 19:28.699
(BEEPS)

19:32.171 --> 19:34.038
(YELLING)

19:42.514 --> 19:45.550
Now that is a Star Destroyer.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.452
Okay, then.
Let's get out of here.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.863
THRAWN: (ON COMLINK)
<i>Commander Jun Sato.</i>

19:58.865 --> 20:03.301
<i>I wondered what it would take</i>
<i>to motivate your return</i>
<i>to Mykapo.</i>

20:03.303 --> 20:05.169
And now you know, Admiral.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.205
Until we meet again.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.975
Yes, until we meet again.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.927
<i>Admiral Konstantine,</i>
<i>you called for assistance?</i>

20:29.929 --> 20:32.396
Quite the contrary.
Admiral, I was contacting you

20:32.398 --> 20:35.166
to report the rebels
have been driven
from this system.

20:35.168 --> 20:41.239
<i>I assume you mean</i>
<i>the rebels and their</i>
<i>sympathizers escaped?</i>

20:42.107 --> 20:43.341
(CLEARS THROAT)

21:00.559 --> 21:03.160
It is good to
see you alive, Mart.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.632
Uncle Jun,
thank you for coming.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.101
Of course.
But we are both indebted

21:10.103 --> 21:11.969
to Captain Syndulla
and her crew.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.805
Yeah!
(CHUCKLES)
(GOOTI LAUGHS)

21:14.807 --> 21:17.775
I can't believe it!
You guys came back!

21:17.777 --> 21:20.578
What do you expect?
We're the Iron Squadron!

21:20.580 --> 21:22.913
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
(GOOTI LAUGHS)
