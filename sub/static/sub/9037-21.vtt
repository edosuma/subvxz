00:04.671 --> 00:05.671
- Hey.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.639
- Hey, robert.
- Hey.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.009
- There's nobody home.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.712
- I wonder what that's like.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.382
- How was your class today,
dear?

00:16.384 --> 00:18.050
Did the children listen to you?

00:18.052 --> 00:21.186
- I teach traffic school, ma.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.022
- Since when?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.556
- Since today.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.225
Lots of cops do it, you know.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.560
A chance to earn
a little spending money.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.297
- How about spending
a little on rent?

00:32.299 --> 00:35.100
- There may not be any money.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.602
Got my first
student evaluations today.

00:36.604 --> 00:37.603
- Oh, yeah?

00:37.605 --> 00:39.071
What did they say, dear?

00:39.073 --> 00:40.272
- Oh, you want to know
what they say?

00:40.274 --> 00:41.373
- Yeah.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.075
- Okay, ma,
here's what they say.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.477
"this class is a sure cure
for insomnia."

00:45.479 --> 00:47.646
- [chuckling]

00:47.648 --> 00:53.152
- "next time just please
take away my license."

00:53.154 --> 00:56.622
- [laughing]

00:56.624 --> 00:58.624
- Eh, no, no,
that's just a couple of people.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.359
Who cares what they say?

01:00.361 --> 01:02.761
- "after ten minutes,

01:02.763 --> 01:04.663
"I wanted to take
the officer's gun

01:04.665 --> 01:07.199
And end my misery."

01:12.839 --> 01:15.541
- I stink.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.342
- Come on, robert,
it was your first time teaching.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.744
- Yeah?

01:18.746 --> 01:21.814
Well, the supervisor said
it may be my last.

01:21.816 --> 01:23.582
He's sitting in
on my class tomorrow.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.284
- Oh, well, now,
that's not fair

01:25.286 --> 01:27.519
You probably just need
a little practice.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.588
- Well, it's really not the type
of thing you can practice.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.758
You know, it's all about
relating to people.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.227
- You're a dead man.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.666
- Honey, listen.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.367
You can practice
on me, dear.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.368
Come on.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.436
Give one of your routines.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.637
- What?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.573
- One of your
traffic things.

01:47.575 --> 01:48.774
Come on.
Come on.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.709
Let's just say
I'm a crazy driver--

01:50.711 --> 01:53.278
Shut up, frank--

01:53.280 --> 01:54.480
And I get caught.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.382
Now I got to go to robbie's
traffic school.

01:57.384 --> 02:00.285
- It's not called
robbie's traffic school, ma!

02:00.287 --> 02:01.553
- It doesn't matter.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.754
It just doesn't matter.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.723
All right, let's pretend
I'm a person--

02:04.725 --> 02:07.392
Shut up frank.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.161
- Hey, you know what
would help me?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.429
- What?

02:10.431 --> 02:11.697
- If I could practice
on all of ya.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.332
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.435
We got enough
for a class right here.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.170
- No, you don't.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.606
Good night.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.141
- No. No. Stop!

02:22.143 --> 02:23.275
- Let me walk you home, dad.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.743
It's dark out.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.445
- Ray.
- What?

02:26.447 --> 02:27.746
- Come on.
Robert, you know what?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.281
You want to run
some things by me,

02:29.283 --> 02:30.415
I'll be happy
to help you.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.817
- Yeah, and I'll help you,
too dear.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.520
And frank will too.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.523
- I don't believe
frank will.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.191
- You could learn
a few things.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.759
- There's nothing wrong
with the way I drive.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.628
- What about that squirrel
you ran over?

02:45.598 --> 02:48.800
- He doubled back.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.335
That squirrel wanted to die.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.371
- Oh, please.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.872
- What about our mailbox, frank?

02:53.874 --> 02:56.675
Did it want to die?

02:56.677 --> 03:00.212
- Don't you have an outstanding
moving violation, dad?

03:00.214 --> 03:03.482
- I wouldn't say
outstanding.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.750
It was pretty good,
though.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.419
[chuckling]

03:07.421 --> 03:09.288
- Well, if you let me
practice my class on you,

03:09.290 --> 03:10.622
It'll take the ticket
off your record

03:10.624 --> 03:12.324
And your insurance
won't go up.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.392
- Wait a minute.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.893
You can do that?

03:14.895 --> 03:19.598
Well, then why don't you just
sign the thing that says I went?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.934
- I didn't hear that, dad.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.203
- All right,
you didn't hear that.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.404
Maybe you'd like to hear it

03:25.406 --> 03:26.939
From some of our
finest presidents.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.340
- Dad!

03:31.311 --> 03:32.477
- All right.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.846
If I have to stay,
so does ray.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.315
He's got that traffic ticket

03:36.317 --> 03:39.318
He doesn't want
to tell debra about.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.319
- Dad.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.587
- What ticket?

03:41.589 --> 03:44.756
- Oh, what is happening?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.960
Traffic school?

03:47.962 --> 03:49.695
How long is this gonna be?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.330
- Well, if we don't
take any breaks,

03:51.332 --> 03:53.398
I can do a condensed version
in three hours.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.900
[all groaning]
- what?

03:54.902 --> 03:58.804
- Sweet crap.

03:58.806 --> 03:59.804
- Wait a minute.
Wait.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.707
How long
is regular traffic school?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.475
- Eight hours.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.810
And you're gonna
have to go to that

04:04.812 --> 04:05.978
If you don't come to me.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.312
That's right.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.481
I got all the papers
you need

04:09.483 --> 04:12.517
Right in here.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.386
I'll go set up.

04:14.388 --> 04:18.257
You have two minutes
before we begin.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.260
I suggest you all visit
the lavatories.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.377
- Okay.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.779
"begin with introductions."

04:44.917 --> 04:46.952
[clears throat]

04:49.822 --> 04:51.823
Hello.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.726
I am sergeant
robert charles barone.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.362
16 years, nypd.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.732
And you are?

05:03.870 --> 05:06.305
- Hated by god.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.907
I-I'm not doin' this.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.375
[snapping fingers]

05:10.377 --> 05:11.710
Ray. Okay?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.345
My name is ray.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.580
[speaking french]
je m'appelle ray.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.316
- Hi, ray.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.384
- Debra.
- Good.

05:19.386 --> 05:23.355
- Hi, I'm marie.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.390
- I'm frank.
Sign my thing.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.833
- Now I would like to direct
your attention to the board.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.536
You will see
"speed limits,"

05:37.538 --> 05:38.704
"pedestrians,"

05:38.706 --> 05:40.772
"signs and signals
of the highway."

05:40.774 --> 05:42.574
- Things that are boring!

05:45.545 --> 05:47.612
- "urban versus rural driving."

05:47.614 --> 05:50.382
- Things I don't care about!

05:50.384 --> 05:51.383
- "insurance."

05:51.385 --> 05:53.985
- Terribly boring things!

05:53.987 --> 05:55.454
- That's enough, raymond!

05:55.456 --> 05:57.122
That's enough.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.627
Now, I would like
each of you to tell us

06:02.629 --> 06:05.597
What offense led you
to being here today.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.100
Let's start with...

06:08.102 --> 06:11.002
Raymond.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.871
- I killed my brother.

06:17.610 --> 06:18.977
- Traffic offense.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.146
- Oh. Oh.

06:21.148 --> 06:24.750
Could you go lie down
in the driveway for a minute?

06:24.752 --> 06:26.418
- It says right here
in the binder

06:26.420 --> 06:28.653
That each student must tell
the offense they committed.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.721
- Yeah, come on.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.456
Let's hear about
your little offense.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.758
Hmm?
- What? It was nothing.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.861
I ran over one of those
orange cones, that's all.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.462
- Tell her why.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.731
- I don't remember, dad.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.433
- I remember.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.135
I was there.

06:43.137 --> 06:46.004
It had something to do
with a halter top.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.172
- Okay!

06:47.174 --> 06:49.508
- Halted you pretty good.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.942
- Dad...

06:54.680 --> 06:55.881
You know how
these things happen.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.916
- [scoffs]

06:57.918 --> 06:59.885
- You see somebody,
and you think they're naked.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.654
And...

07:02.656 --> 07:04.656
Then you look,
and they're just--

07:04.658 --> 07:06.691
They're wearing a beige top,
and the next thing you know,

07:06.693 --> 07:09.561
You've run over
a couple cones.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.596
- Reckless driving.

07:11.598 --> 07:16.635
- So you just ride around
lookin' for naked?

07:16.637 --> 07:17.936
- Well, if it won't
come to me...

07:17.938 --> 07:20.872
- Yeah.

07:20.874 --> 07:24.609
- Look, okay, can we get back
to the course, please?

07:24.611 --> 07:26.011
Who can answer this question?

07:26.013 --> 07:28.713
"at 55 miles an hour,

07:28.715 --> 07:32.451
"you will travel over 800 feet
in 10 to 12 seconds.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.754
"so will an oncoming truck.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.757
To pass safely,
how many feet will you need?"

07:38.759 --> 07:39.958
Dad.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.959
- Sign my thing.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.494
- Come on!

07:44.230 --> 07:46.031
What are ya doin'?

07:46.033 --> 07:49.034
- Robert, that question
is really complicated.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.235
Is that something
they would ask?

07:50.237 --> 07:51.236
- It's in the binder.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.838
- Well, you know what?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.639
Maybe we don't
have to do this class

07:54.641 --> 07:56.007
Exactly like it is
in the binder.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.576
- What do you mean?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.177
The binder's
not just a guide, debra.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.113
The binder is...

08:02.115 --> 08:04.816
Binding.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.053
- Shut up, frank.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.054
- What?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.522
- Yeah, yeah.

08:10.524 --> 08:14.092
You were about to do
a bathroom joke.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.961
- A bathroom joke?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.730
- Yeah,
about binding.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.834
- All right, look,
let's focus, people.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.936
- [chuckling]
rice.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.838
[laughter]

08:26.840 --> 08:27.906
- Lookit, please,

08:27.908 --> 08:30.642
Can we--
- cheese.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.911
- That's enough!

08:32.913 --> 08:34.045
H-h-how about
some questions--

08:34.047 --> 08:35.814
- Bananas!

08:35.816 --> 08:38.817
[laughter]

08:38.819 --> 08:40.619
- Things that are binding.

08:43.122 --> 08:46.157
- Would you please?

08:46.159 --> 08:48.760
These are safety issues.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.762
And let's remember something:

08:50.764 --> 08:51.930
Driving is a privilege,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.665
Not a right.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.700
- [clears throat]

08:55.702 --> 08:58.270
Yams. I'm sorry.
[giggling]

08:58.272 --> 08:59.804
I'm sorry, robert.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.640
- Don't apologize.
That was good.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.009
Yams!

09:04.011 --> 09:05.877
[laughter]

09:05.879 --> 09:07.546
- Sorry.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.981
- That explains
last thanksgiving.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.984
[cackling]

09:17.590 --> 09:22.193
- You're not helping, ma.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.864
- Oh, we're just having
a little fun.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.133
- But we're not here
to have fun.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.868
- Well, then,
you're the man for the job.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.803
[shrieking
and laughing]

09:40.613 --> 09:41.813
- Maybe I'm not.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.281
- Oh, oh, come on.
- Oh, come on, rob.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.749
- Come on, robert.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.618
I'm just saying,
if we have to do this,

09:46.620 --> 09:47.719
Why has it
got to be torture?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.954
- Oh, I see.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.823
I'm sorry this is torture.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.326
I guess
the student evaluations

09:54.328 --> 09:55.594
Were correct.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.597
- Oh, come on.
- Oh.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.665
- Stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.033
I'm just trying
to give you some advice.

10:02.035 --> 10:06.071
- And what is that advice,
raymond?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.239
- I don't know.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.141
Lighten up.

10:10.143 --> 10:13.244
- Oh, lighten up.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.246
Thank you very much.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.352
- Hey.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.721
You didn't sign my thing.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.666
- What did you do?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.167
- What, he left.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.837
- It breaks my heart
the way you treat your brother.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.105
- Me?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.873
You were all laughing at him.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.709
- I was not laughing.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.047
- You weren't laughing?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.048
Rice.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.117
- [laughs]

10:52.119 --> 10:54.052
That was funny.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.420
- All right, you know,
I think we were all

10:55.422 --> 10:57.188
A little bit insensitive.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.025
- Well, robert's got no sense
of humor about himself.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.292
- Oh, that's right.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.928
You got to be able
to laugh at yourself.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.397
Look at me.

11:05.399 --> 11:08.667
I laugh at your mother
all the time.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.201
- I'm not you, frank.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.903
- I know,
but I'm married to you,

11:11.905 --> 11:15.206
So the joke's on me.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.776
- Look, robert's feeling
pretty bad.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.411
I mean, I think
we need to apologize

11:19.413 --> 11:21.379
And make it up to him.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.281
Go ahead, ray.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.382
- What? No.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.383
- Yes.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.785
Go speak to your brother.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.453
- No.

11:28.455 --> 11:32.157
- Oh, robbie,
I'm so glad you're back.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.992
And raymond's sorry
for what he said.

11:33.994 --> 11:34.993
- No, no.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.828
Raymond was right.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.730
This doesn't
have to be torture.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.065
I just got to learn to...

11:40.067 --> 11:41.966
Lighten up.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.735
And to that end,

11:43.737 --> 11:46.705
I'd like
to introduce you to...

11:46.707 --> 11:48.373
Traffic cop timmy!

11:48.375 --> 11:49.841
- Oh.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.114
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.216
Timmy's gonna help teach us
the rest of the class tonight.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.184
Isn't that right, timmy?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.286
- 10-4, sarge.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.289
- Look, robert...

12:04.291 --> 12:05.289
I'm sorry.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.859
What I said
about lightening up here--

12:07.861 --> 12:10.895
This might be too light,
you know.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.263
- No, no.
It's okay, raymond.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.332
You know,
my partner judy uses timmy

12:14.334 --> 12:15.967
To teach the kids
about safety,

12:15.969 --> 12:16.967
And they all love her.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.370
- Yeah, and judy
has warmer hands.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.740
- Oh, sorry, timmy.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.874
[chuckles]

12:22.876 --> 12:25.276
- Oh, robbie,
you're very good.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.246
- Hey, make his eyes
move again.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.447
How do you do that?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.416
- I'm not doing anything.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.852
- Hey, frank, why don't ya
park it over there?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.286
And I mean legally.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.454
[laughter]

12:36.456 --> 12:37.756
- All right.

12:37.758 --> 12:41.359
Now we got a show.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.360
- Can you believe this?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.062
- Look at his little shoes.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.396
[giggling]

12:45.398 --> 12:47.031
- All right, now, timmy,

12:47.033 --> 12:49.067
Tell everybody
what we'll be learning next.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.869
- Wait, wait,
wait a minute, robert.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.270
Come on, you're really
gonna do this?

12:52.272 --> 12:55.440
- Hey, ray,
this was your idea.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.308
- Did anybody
hear me say "puppet"?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.379
- Aw, that's quite enough
out of you.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.548
Now why don't you sit down...

13:03.550 --> 13:05.250
Big nose?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.386
- What?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.821
- [laughs]

13:09.823 --> 13:13.825
He called you big nose.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.894
- Come on, come on.
We're being supportive.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.428
- Look how cute he is.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.898
- All right, timmy,
now let's behave ourself.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.000
We're here to teach
traffic school.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.301
- Oh, yeah, right. Okay.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.302
Uh, let's see.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.370
Who can answer this?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.172
When you're behind
another vehicle,

13:27.174 --> 13:30.441
What is the proper
following distance?

13:30.443 --> 13:32.143
Frank?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.312
- Uh, well, if the guy's
goin' really slow,

13:34.314 --> 13:38.316
I like to be
right on his butt...

13:38.318 --> 13:41.252
So if he looks back,
he can read my lips.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.889
- No, dad.

13:45.891 --> 13:49.394
It is one car length
per ten miles of speed.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.595
- [chuckles]

13:50.597 --> 13:52.530
Yeah, remind me
to never drive with you,

13:52.532 --> 13:54.599
You crazy old bastard.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.143
- How's that?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.377
- [clears throat]
all right.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.947
Now, let's move on, timmy.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.348
Don't you have
a question for ma?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.549
- Sure.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.051
Marie, is it?
- Yes.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.520
- Hi, marie. Okay.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.355
Now, when you
get into the car,

14:17.357 --> 14:20.558
What are you supposed to do
before you begin driving?

14:20.560 --> 14:21.993
- Oh, I know that.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.428
You buckle your seat belt.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.896
- Good.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.231
- And--and you
check your mirrors.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.099
- Correct.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.400
- You look to the left.
You look to the right.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.401
You look behind you.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.036
- Very good.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.271
Anything else?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.139
- No, I think that's it.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.275
- Oh, that's it.
- Uh-huh.

14:37.277 --> 14:41.512
- She thinks that's it.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.215
- Isn't--
isn't that everything, timmy?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.150
- Oh, yeah, sure,
that's everything,

14:46.152 --> 14:48.119
But how about making sure

14:48.121 --> 14:49.888
Your firstborn child
is in the car

14:49.890 --> 14:51.222
Before you pull out
of a gas station

14:51.224 --> 14:52.924
In new mexico?

15:02.368 --> 15:05.570
- Wow, that's awfully
specific, yeah.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.639
Is that in the binder?

15:07.641 --> 15:11.175
- Robbie, that was 30 years ago.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.944
- I don't have
a problem with it.

15:16.348 --> 15:20.151
- Uh-oh.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.452
- Yeah, remember that?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.255
Big road trip,
fun family vacation.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.224
Driving out to see
the grand canyon.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.592
Frank stops
to get some gas,

15:27.594 --> 15:29.093
And you all drive off

15:29.095 --> 15:32.363
While robert's still
in the men's room.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.431
- How do you know?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.532
You weren't there.

15:42.574 --> 15:47.145
- Oh, we got a real
battle of wits goin' on here.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.414
- We thought you were
sleeping in the back.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.482
It was only an hour driving.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.483
And then we noticed.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.485
And we turned right around.

15:54.487 --> 15:58.289
- Oh, only two hours.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.292
Excellent mothering.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.728
- I remember that.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.197
We missed the tribal dances.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.398
Hey, you would've
liked that, ray.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.336
I hear those ladies
don't wear very much.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.738
- Aw, poor raymond missed
the tribal dances.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.975
Raymond, raymond, raymond.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.710
Meanwhile,
back at the rest stop,

16:18.712 --> 16:21.612
A couple of truckers
want to braid robert's hair.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.252
- We happen to be
very good parents, timmy!

16:28.254 --> 16:30.488
- Aw, yeah,
great family, right?

16:30.490 --> 16:34.192
Long as everybody's eatin',
everybody's happy, right, mama?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.361
Just ask your husband,
burp 'n' slurp.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.199
- Hey!

16:41.201 --> 16:44.035
How come you haven't said
anything about debra yet?

16:44.037 --> 16:46.170
- I don't have a problem
with debra.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.006
You're all right, cookie.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.640
Ah, cha-cha-cha.

16:51.243 --> 16:55.413
- I think traffic school's
over now.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.682
- Me too; I'm gettin' tired
of timmy's mouth.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.584
- Aw, sit down, shiny.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.152
- You want to start with me?

17:01.154 --> 17:03.287
- Dad, dad, dad,
dad, dad.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.456
Dad, puppet.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.094
- Yeah, right.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.529
If it was raymond's
traffic school,

17:11.531 --> 17:13.698
Everybody would
be sitting here without a peep.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.167
But the minute
this poor slob...

17:19.104 --> 17:21.406
Needs something...

17:21.408 --> 17:24.442
Everybody's too busy.

17:24.444 --> 17:28.413
Everybody makes with the jokes.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.747
Nobody cares.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.285
Come on, flatfoot.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.487
Let's get the hell
out of here.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.540
- Timmy's mean.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.148
- Robert.

18:06.452 --> 18:07.852
[gasps]

18:09.588 --> 18:12.090
Damn it.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.524
Robert.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.263
What have you done
with robert?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.335
Robert!

18:24.337 --> 18:26.637
[knocking]

18:26.639 --> 18:28.639
- I'm not signing
your thing, dad.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.878
- Hey.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.313
- Oh.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.248
Hey.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.218
I'm not signing
your thing either.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.219
- That's all right.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.820
Listen...

18:42.822 --> 18:45.756
I'm sorry about the...

18:45.758 --> 18:48.159
You know, tellin' you
to lighten up and everything.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.894
- It's all right.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.562
Gave it a shot.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.763
- Yeah.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.232
Yeah, it went well.

18:57.536 --> 19:00.204
Boy, that timmy's got a lot
of issues, though, huh?

19:03.509 --> 19:06.410
- You know,
timmy's just a puppet.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.379
- Yeah, I know.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.516
It's good
to hear you say it.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.485
- Made a real ass
out of myself, didn't I?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.853
- Eh.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.855
You know what people like?

19:17.857 --> 19:20.791
Balloon animals.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.695
- My whole life, every time
I felt bad for myself,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.531
Mom would say,
"the family will help you.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.432
We'll make you feel better."

19:28.434 --> 19:32.170
I'd fall for it every time.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.238
- Yeah, well,
mom and dad...

19:34.240 --> 19:37.241
You know,
this parenting stuff...

19:37.243 --> 19:39.277
It's just not their field.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.211
You know.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.882
- They did all right by you.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.751
You're the golden boy.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.619
- Oh, will you
stop that already, okay?

19:48.621 --> 19:50.588
They messed me up
just as much as you, pal.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.223
- Oh, yeah.
You're as messed up as me.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.858
- Yeah, probably more so.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.294
- You're insultin' me now?

19:56.296 --> 19:58.496
- You don't own messed up.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.431
You were neglected.
Try being smothered.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.434
- I used to pray
for smothered.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.236
- Oh, you want smothered?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.672
How about in school when mom
became cafeteria monitor

20:07.674 --> 20:09.807
To make sure
I ate all my food

20:09.809 --> 20:11.375
And kept my sweater on

20:11.377 --> 20:14.645
And sat with her?

20:14.647 --> 20:15.846
- That was bad.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.548
- Yeah. All right?

20:17.550 --> 20:18.749
- Hey, hey, how about the time

20:18.751 --> 20:20.284
You started
walking to school, right?

20:20.286 --> 20:21.953
And mom would follow you
the whole way.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.387
- She did?
- Yeah.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.623
Yeah, she'd hide
from tree to tree.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.693
- Heh.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.628
Oh, my god.

20:30.630 --> 20:35.866
Oh, my--that's the crazy
tree lady from the dreams.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.468
- Nightmares, huh?

20:37.470 --> 20:38.736
- Yeah!

20:38.738 --> 20:39.971
- How long did you have 'em?

20:39.973 --> 20:43.641
- I just had one four days ago.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.910
- That is pretty messed up.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.512
- Yeah, it is.

20:48.514 --> 20:52.617
Hey, so the jumpin'
canoe guy is...

20:52.619 --> 20:53.451
- Dad.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.989
- Oh, my god.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.523
- [chuckles]

20:59.525 --> 21:01.492
Thanks for comin' over, raymond.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.394
You really did
make me feel better.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.595
- Yeah.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.498
Man, they were worse
than I thought.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.700
I should talk to them.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.969
- Want to borrow the dummy?

21:29.755 --> 21:30.554
- [yells]

21:36.962 --> 21:41.365
- Not so funny
without his head, is he?

21:41.367 --> 21:42.733
- What did you do, dad?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.503
I need that.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.804
- [screams]

21:53.412 --> 21:56.414
- [maniacal laughter]
