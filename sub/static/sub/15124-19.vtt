WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.238
Whoo!

00:04.272 --> 00:05.639
* Here we go

00:05.673 --> 00:09.110
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:10.178 --> 00:11.812
(laughter)

00:11.845 --> 00:13.747
Oh, yeah? Well,
I checked my phone,

00:13.781 --> 00:15.749
and I realized Lochlyn
has been playing

00:15.783 --> 00:18.219
"Words With Buddies,"
and she's beating my Uncle Dave.

00:18.252 --> 00:21.755
It's no surprise-- her cranium
measures in the 85th percentile.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.757
WOMAN: I took out
a ruler last night,

00:23.791 --> 00:25.593
and it turns out that
my little Jacqueline's face

00:25.626 --> 00:27.061
is perfectly symmetrical.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.396
Well, my Allister

00:28.429 --> 00:30.198
started doing the cutest
thing-- watch this:

00:30.231 --> 00:33.067
Allister, Allister,
do "Gangnam Style"!

00:33.101 --> 00:34.335
Come on!

00:34.368 --> 00:36.237
Hold on,
he'll do it.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.571
JIMMY: Sabrina and I
don't usually socialize

00:37.605 --> 00:39.540
with other parents at the park,
mostly because

00:39.573 --> 00:40.708
we've found them annoying.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.510
But today we were on a mission.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.213
It all started a few weeks ago
when we decided

00:45.246 --> 00:46.680
to plan Hope's birthday party.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.349
Wait a second,
wait a second.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.551
The package for the moon bounce,
the invitations,

00:50.584 --> 00:52.220
the goody bags,
and the entertainment

00:52.253 --> 00:53.687
is how much, exactly?

00:53.721 --> 00:56.124
Are you kidding me?!

00:56.157 --> 00:58.259
My wedding
didn't cost that much.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.627
Forget it.
(phone beeps off)

00:59.660 --> 01:01.195
Listen, if you want to
plan an affordable party,

01:01.229 --> 01:02.730
you got to stop calling

01:02.763 --> 01:04.398
those fancy places that
can afford Web sites,

01:04.432 --> 01:06.100
and hit the local
bulletin boards.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.136
Yeah, Laundromats,
bowling alleys.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.271
We used to find your
babysitters at the bus station.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.706
How many kids are coming?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.175
Hope doesn't have
any kid friends yet.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.243
Yeah, she's only three.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.477
BURT:
I don't blame you.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.112
Finding kid friends
before they start school

01:18.146 --> 01:19.313
means you have to talk
to the parents.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.215
And all they want
to talk about is their kids.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.616
"My son walked
at eight months."

01:22.650 --> 01:24.452
(deep voice): "My son knows
all his letters."

01:24.485 --> 01:26.254
(deeper voice):
"My son has a friend.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.289
You never heard us
saying all that stuff.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.324
Is that why I didn't have
any friends growing up?

01:30.358 --> 01:32.393
Because you guys couldn't stand
the other parents?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.163
Don't judge us-- you know you're
doing the exact same thing.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.797
Oh, my God.
We really are.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.666
At least
we had an excuse.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.302
We still believed Burt
was gonna be a rock star.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.337
We didn't need to embrace
the whole parent lifestyle.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.339
We were gonna be
trashing hotel rooms.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.840
Hanging out
with Foghat.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.809
Driving sports cars
into pools.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.145
Yeah, we had big dreams.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.314
But you didn't
need any friends.
You turned out fine.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.915
Fine?
I didn't say you
turned out great.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.217
I said you
turned out fine.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.618
It's a scale, Jimmy.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.153
If you didn't have any
friends, what'd you do?

01:59.187 --> 02:01.789
(sighing):
I had to improvise.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.591
What do you want to do?

02:03.624 --> 02:06.694
(goofy voice): I don't know.
You can crumple up some paper

02:06.727 --> 02:08.529
and throw it in my mouth.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.799
(normal voice): Yeah, I guess
we can do that again.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.234
Hi, you, hi, you...

02:13.267 --> 02:14.802
We got to get
Hope some friends.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.238
So here we are.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.939
My Jacqueline
can do that, too!

02:18.972 --> 02:20.208
Jacqueline!

02:20.241 --> 02:22.510
Do the Chinese dance!

02:22.543 --> 02:25.313
Hey! If your kid likes to dance,

02:25.346 --> 02:28.182
we're having
a birthday party for Hope!

02:28.216 --> 02:29.883
Yeah.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.352
(crickets chirping)

02:31.385 --> 02:34.188
Okay, see you Saturday at 2:00.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.356
We did it!

02:35.389 --> 02:37.558
We are so crushing
this party.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.193
We got food, entertainment,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.562
even a moon bounce
for almost nothing.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.697
We should be party planners
for poor people.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.867
We'd make a fortune.
I still can't believe
people just leave

02:46.900 --> 02:49.303
their broken piÃ±ata
pieces in the park
after their parties.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.340
I know. Hope is gonna love
Top-Gun-Chicken-Ass-

02:52.373 --> 02:53.907
purple-T-Rex-shortstop.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.379
And since I've been here,
with the support

02:58.412 --> 03:00.248
of my counselors and my group...

03:00.281 --> 03:03.484
I haven't touched
the junk since.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.219
Good for you, TV's Tim Stack.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.488
We know that masturbation
is a tough addiction to beat.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.657
VIRGINIA:
Check out TV's Tim Stack.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.593
Talk about a lesson to get kids
to stop masturbating.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.263
Let's turn our attention now to
former chart-topping rock star,

03:15.296 --> 03:16.530
Smokey Floyd.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.935
Hey, look at Smokey!

03:21.969 --> 03:23.604
He looks great!

03:23.637 --> 03:26.274
So, Smokey, can you tell us
about the moment

03:26.307 --> 03:28.576
you hit rock bottom?
Well, dude,

03:28.609 --> 03:32.246
it all started when I promised
a fan I'd play a show for him.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.616
I went crazy, and the video
went viral on the Internet.

03:35.649 --> 03:39.320
Smokey, "the Doctor of Rock,"
frickin' Floyd!

03:41.655 --> 03:43.391
(people gasping)

03:43.424 --> 03:45.025
Burt, it's you!

03:45.058 --> 03:46.394
(fans whooping)

03:46.427 --> 03:48.362
I-I'm famous.
Aah!

03:48.396 --> 03:50.030
I'll bet, like, four billion
people just saw that!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.866
You know, I looked at myself
in that video, and...

03:52.900 --> 03:54.702
realized that
I'd become a monster.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.339
You know, a liver-spotted,
turkey-necked monster.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.409
So I went down to Mexico and
got some plastic surgeries.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.477
You know, they were
so-so with the knife,

04:03.511 --> 04:05.479
but real liberal with
the painkillers.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.281
Next thing I knew,
I'm hooked

04:07.315 --> 04:10.784
on vikes, perks, oxy,
coffee enemas.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.454
I'm told I burned my house down.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.955
HOST: Let's take a look
at Smokey's journey

04:14.988 --> 04:16.657
over the last 30 days.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.494
(screeches):
Oh!

04:20.528 --> 04:21.829
Mm.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.332
Which way to the stage?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.300
(gentle pop intro plays)

04:26.334 --> 04:30.371
* You with the sad heart

04:30.404 --> 04:31.672
* Don't be discouraged

04:31.705 --> 04:35.008
* You will realize

04:35.042 --> 04:38.479
* It's hard to take courage

04:38.512 --> 04:41.014
* In a world full of people

04:41.048 --> 04:43.617
* You can lose sight
of your own *

04:43.651 --> 04:46.354
* And the darkness,
ooh, inside you *

04:46.387 --> 04:48.822
* Can make you feel so small

04:48.856 --> 04:52.393
* And I see your true colors

04:52.426 --> 04:54.495
* Shining through

04:54.528 --> 04:57.931
* I see your true colors

04:57.965 --> 05:00.468
* That's why I love you

05:00.501 --> 05:03.371
* So don't be afraid

05:03.404 --> 05:06.106
* To let them show

05:06.139 --> 05:09.343
* Your true colors

05:09.377 --> 05:11.879
* True colors...

05:11.912 --> 05:14.415
* True colors

05:14.448 --> 05:16.684
* They're shining through

05:16.717 --> 05:20.388
* Your true colors.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.490
Well, you've obviously
come a long way,

05:22.523 --> 05:23.891
and we couldn't be more excited

05:23.924 --> 05:26.527
to hear your final pledge
of sobriety.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.362
Well, I-I believe
in the adage:

05:28.396 --> 05:30.431
"If you love something,
set it free," you know?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.500
Uh, which is why I'm
setting free pills and alcohol.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.067
But if they come back to me,

05:34.101 --> 05:35.903
then I'll know
they really love me.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.506
Until then, I...
just want to say

05:38.539 --> 05:40.374
I'm sorry to all the people
I hurt along the way.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.444
I wrote all your names down
on this list, and...

05:43.477 --> 05:46.447
I'll be coming to apologize
to you one by one.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.948
(doorbell rings)

05:50.951 --> 05:52.520
(gasps)

05:52.553 --> 05:55.556
Burt Chance, you're
number 33 on my list:

05:55.589 --> 05:57.658
"Robbed a Lawn Guy
of the Smokey Floyd experience."

05:57.691 --> 06:00.928
I'd like to stay with you
for a week and make up for it.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.932
BOTH:
Let's rock and roll!

06:04.965 --> 06:06.400
Whoo!

06:11.472 --> 06:14.542
Hey, Barney, thank you again
for taking care of the cake.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.009
Well, don't
thank me yet.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.446
There was a bit of an e-mail
mix-up with the bakery.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.513
I accidentally switched
Hope's picture

06:19.547 --> 06:21.415
with the one I use
for my online

06:21.449 --> 06:24.051
dating profile.
(Sabrina gasps)

06:24.084 --> 06:25.786
What?
Oh.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.488
Hey, everybody on
those sites lies.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.956
I once thought I was
going out with a girl

06:28.989 --> 06:30.591
who claimed she had
the body of Kate Upton.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.660
She was bald, and one of
her legs had two knees.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.798
Smokey, these are the
hosts, our son Jimmy

06:37.831 --> 06:39.132
and his wife Sabrina.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.601
Let's get
this party started.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.070
Uh, no, thank you.
And, c-could you possibly

06:43.103 --> 06:45.072
not use the cocaine
around the other parents?

06:45.105 --> 06:48.141
'Cause we're just... trying to
get our daughter some friends.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.578
Well, from my experience, that
usually helps you make friends.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.480
But this is actually
my lactose-intolerance pill.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.448
I got to crush it up
and snort it

06:54.482 --> 06:56.950
so I don't re-trigger
my addiction to pills.

06:56.984 --> 07:01.489
So, how are you guys enjoying
the rock-and-roll lifestyle?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.791
It sucks. The only stones
he has any stories about

07:03.824 --> 07:06.159
are the ones in his kidneys.
When you're young,

07:06.193 --> 07:08.996
you see a rock star
on TV, you dream about
hanging out with him.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.831
And then that dream
finally comes true--

07:10.864 --> 07:12.966
you spend your day
watching the Weather Channel,

07:13.000 --> 07:14.835
talking about compression socks.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.906
I'm just saying,
enjoy your circulation

07:18.939 --> 07:20.808
while you still got it, kid.

07:20.841 --> 07:24.144
Deep vein thrombosis
is not as cool as it sounds.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.479
(doorbell rings)

07:27.180 --> 07:29.483
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

07:29.517 --> 07:32.152
Ooh, look, everybody--
it's Beauty and the Beast!

07:32.185 --> 07:34.855
Actually, we're
Beauty and the Beaver.
Yeah, for 20 bucks

07:34.888 --> 07:37.691
and leftover cake, you don't get
copyrighted characters.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.661
Wait a minute, I thought
you were hiring professionals,

07:40.694 --> 07:43.096
not Andrew
and his ex-wife Donna!

07:43.130 --> 07:44.498
That's ex-ex-wife.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.766
We're back together.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.201
And they are professionals.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.571
Yeah. Just because
we've never done this before

07:50.604 --> 07:53.507
and we haven't been paid doesn't
mean we're not professionals.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.643
Plus, I have always dreamed
of being in show business,

07:55.676 --> 07:58.679
so this act gives me
a reason to not dump
Andrew's ass again.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.047
We couldn't be happier.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.184
Look, I know
he's four years old,

08:04.217 --> 08:06.153
but he likes it and I like it.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.055
Plus, I even use
some of the leftovers

08:08.088 --> 08:09.890
to make this nice, soft cheese

08:09.923 --> 08:12.225
that he loves to put
on crackers, so...

08:12.259 --> 08:13.861
why stop breast-feeding now?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.563
(chuckles)

08:17.898 --> 08:19.567
This party reminds you
of some crazy,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.569
wild stories, huh, Smokey?

08:21.602 --> 08:25.138
I told you, I don't
want to glorify that
lifestyle, bro.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.908
No second scoops, kid.
Today it's two,

08:27.941 --> 08:30.578
tomorrow it's three,
and then the next
thing you know,

08:30.611 --> 08:33.313
you're behind the
Roxy offering to suck
Nikki Sixx's toes

08:33.346 --> 08:36.584
for a scoop of
heroin fudge ripple!

08:36.617 --> 08:38.719
Sorry. That got
a little personal.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.821
(doorbell rings)

08:40.854 --> 08:42.690
Pizza Man.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.758
Well... where's the
rest of the pizza?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.093
This is it.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.630
We ordered two
super jumbo pizzas.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.098
These are super jumbo pizzas.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.266
We've recently
redefined our sizes.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.835
We also have
super duper jumbo

08:54.868 --> 08:57.170
and super grande jumbo.
But for a party this size,

08:57.204 --> 09:00.641
you really should have
ordered two "damn, that's
too much pizza" pizzas.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.610
All right, well... just
take 'em in the kitchen

09:02.643 --> 09:04.578
and cut 'em into
a hundred pieces.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.048
Hey, Pizza Man.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.650
Hey, Smokey Floyd.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.657
(liquid pouring)

09:20.160 --> 09:22.696
Oh, my God, that is
so inappropriate.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.932
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I was just gonna...
No,

09:24.965 --> 09:27.267
you get to drink while
I have to be sober

09:27.300 --> 09:29.136
trying not to freak out
that Liz's three-year-old

09:29.169 --> 09:30.938
is underneath her shirt
going to town.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.706
(sighs)
I know, right?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.675
Come on, girl,
hook a sister up.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.376
We can get through
this together.
All right.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.611
(doorbell rings)

09:37.645 --> 09:38.979
Hello.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.648
Wha...?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.750
Where would you
like me to set up?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.317
Wha... What is that?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.286
I ordered
a bounce house.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.256
No, you ordered
a moon bounce.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.660
In what world do you get
a bounce house for $17?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.828
I guess I just thought
you were an idiot.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.630
There's a corner
in the living room.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.971
You got to preserve
those precious memories.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.739
Yep.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.641
I tape all my son's parties.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.777
Of course, I mainly do it

10:09.810 --> 10:11.979
so I don't have to talk to any
of the other annoying parents.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.782
I ran out of tape
half an hour ago.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.016
(chuckles):
Scott.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.786
Jimmy.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.853
Hey.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.689
I just met the coolest dad.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.691
You're kidding!
I just met the coolest mom.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.826
Man, I can't believe
we found two.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.661
This party's turning
out to be great!

10:27.695 --> 10:29.730
Okay, you've had
your five jumps.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.298
That was worth a
ten-minute wait, right?

10:31.331 --> 10:32.933
Oh, boo-hoo!

10:32.966 --> 10:35.268
When I was your age,
I was sewing soccer balls

10:35.302 --> 10:36.737
for eight cents a day!

10:39.740 --> 10:41.341
Let's go.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.844
(kids cheering)

10:43.877 --> 10:44.878
Aah.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.446
That's scary.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.182
DONNA (whispers):
We're losing 'em.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.218
Quick, do "Gangnam Style."

10:51.251 --> 10:53.020
I don't know it.
Just do it!

10:54.722 --> 10:55.989
Look! Gag-'em Style!

10:56.023 --> 10:57.290
Whoo-hoo!
Gag-'em Style!

10:57.324 --> 10:59.727
Gag-'em Style!
(kids booing)

10:59.760 --> 11:01.895
(groans)

11:01.929 --> 11:03.163
Mom, Dad,

11:03.196 --> 11:04.832
look, we've got a problem.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.734
All right, the entertainment
you guys booked sucks,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.168
and everyone
is gonna leave.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.470
Okay, we can't work this party.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.339
One of those little animals
just dropped a dirty diaper

11:12.372 --> 11:13.741
down the back
of Andrew's costume,

11:13.774 --> 11:15.308
and now he's
in the shower crying,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.045
which, as you can imagine,
is a huge turn-on.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.980
Excuse me, darling.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.883
Would a tiny piece of pizza
bring you joy?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.718
I'm sorry...

11:24.752 --> 11:27.888
was I being a crab, man?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.157
I'm sorry.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.725
I have to give you
your money back.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.260
Your American children
are far too fat,

11:33.293 --> 11:34.828
and they're stretching out
my springs.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.097
That trampoline is my only form
of daytime income.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.933
Great, now we don't even have
the sucky entertainment.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.334
What are we supposed to do now?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.803
You guys got to fix this.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.406
VIRGINIA:
Smokey,

11:46.439 --> 11:50.944
we need to ask you
a giant favor.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.112
Would you go out there

11:52.145 --> 11:53.881
and play a song

11:53.914 --> 11:55.883
at my granddaughter's
third birthday party?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.419
I'd be honored.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.789
But I haven't played
guitar sober

12:01.822 --> 12:02.890
since I was 12.

12:02.923 --> 12:03.924
I can play guitar.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.893
That's fine, dude,

12:05.926 --> 12:07.194
but I can't hit the high notes.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.462
Never could.
All the high notes on my album

12:09.496 --> 12:11.799
were sung by a little
Filipino boy named Dalawapo.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.802
Oh, well, I can help
with the singing.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.136
Me, too, and Andrew and I

12:16.169 --> 12:17.838
have a bunch of instruments,

12:17.871 --> 12:19.272
so we could be your band.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.141
And I've been known to wail
on slide whistle.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.943
I mean, we've never
even played together.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.945
I mean, how are we gonna
keep time without a drummer?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.214
One, two, three, four.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.818
Hello, children of Natesville
and their caretakers.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.885
I'm Smokey Floyd.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.954
Most of my songs are for adults

12:33.987 --> 12:35.155
who are high on stuff,

12:35.188 --> 12:37.157
but a few years back,
I wrote a song

12:37.190 --> 12:39.459
for a really stupid girl
I was dating.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.794
I think you all
might like it.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.429
Maybe learn a
few things, too.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.064
It's called
"When You're Alone."

12:44.097 --> 12:45.265
* When you're in the kitchen

12:45.298 --> 12:47.234
* You've got to behave

12:47.267 --> 12:51.171
* You don't put metal
in the microwave *

12:51.204 --> 12:54.574
* The knobs on the stove
are hands-off, no doubt *

12:54.607 --> 12:57.344
* And if you make toast,
you don't use *

12:57.377 --> 12:59.346
* A knife to fish it out

12:59.379 --> 13:01.148
WOMEN:
* When you're alone

13:01.181 --> 13:03.183
* When you're home alone

13:03.216 --> 13:07.020
* You got to stay safe
when you're home all alone *

13:07.054 --> 13:08.355
* When you're alone

13:08.388 --> 13:10.858
* When you're home alone

13:10.891 --> 13:14.361
* You got to make sure
not to die *

13:14.394 --> 13:17.197
* Or choke
or burn the house down. *

13:17.230 --> 13:18.165
(plays descending tone)

13:18.198 --> 13:20.433
We did it. We're rock stars.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.935
This was awesome.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.971
Must be what it feels like
to be high on drugs.

13:24.004 --> 13:24.872
Oh, not even close.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.914
* Happy birthday, dear Hope

13:33.947 --> 13:37.817
* Happy birthday to you...

13:38.919 --> 13:40.620
(cheering)

13:40.653 --> 13:43.023
Good night, Natesville.
Thank you.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.225
Sabrina, that band was amazing.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.195
You guys aren't like the other
parents; we should be friends.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.963
You know, we were just saying
the same thing.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.232
Steph, Steph,
we got an emergency.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.034
Lochlyn was just holding
another girl's hand,

13:54.067 --> 13:55.903
and I'm all
out of hand sanitizer.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.137
We'll meet you in the car.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.238
Come on, honey, come on.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.572
Okay, come on.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.208
Come on.
See you guys around the park?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.977
Yeah.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.079
Oh, no,
she's married to that jerk?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.647
Well, you know,
we still have Scott.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.216
Hopefully his wife is cool.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.051
Scott, Scott, Scott,

14:11.084 --> 14:12.519
my sister just
e-mailed me a video

14:12.552 --> 14:14.521
that is definitely
the next dance craze.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.389
I already taught Allister
the first three steps.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.025
Go ahead, buddy.
Come on, Allister.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.059
Do the dance.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.494
Do it for Daddy.
Show Daddy.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.330
Hope doesn't need any
kid friends, right?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.998
Nope, she's gonna
make friends in college.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.900
That was the most amazing
thing ever.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.102
I'm so excited.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.038
I can't stop bouncing.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.941
I'm so excited
you can't stop bouncing, too.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.109
You know, there's kids parties
in this town

14:36.143 --> 14:37.577
every weekend
that need entertainment.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.979
And you heard that crowd.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.280
They loved us.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.514
We could be huge.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.250
Oh, we could be bigger
than huge.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.618
We could be the Winger
of kid's music.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.554
(gasps):
Geez...!

14:47.587 --> 14:49.356
Which is why it's hard to do
what I got to do.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.358
I'm breaking up the band.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.093
ANDREW:
You can't do that.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.127
I finally discovered

14:54.161 --> 14:55.929
my purpose in life

14:55.963 --> 14:58.065
is not to run a food pantry
for the homeless.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.101
I was born to be a dancing
beaver in a kid's band.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.070
That set was so awesome!

15:03.103 --> 15:04.271
That wasn't a set, bro.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.973
You can't be awesome
with one song.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.641
Yeah, well, um,
what about Francis Scott Key?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.643
How many songs did she write?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.112
I'm a concert cellist.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.613
I can help write some songs.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.082
And I can help him.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.717
We could lock
ourselves in a room

15:17.750 --> 15:21.288
and not come out of there
until our thighs ache.

15:21.321 --> 15:25.092
That's the spirit, guys.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.494
Guys, that's not how the music
business works, all right?

15:27.527 --> 15:29.329
Plus, we don't even have
a manager.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.164
Uh, I-I'll be your manager.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.665
I was the equipment manager

15:32.699 --> 15:34.434
for my high school
marching band.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.969
I didn't have what it took
to play the triangle,

15:36.003 --> 15:37.971
but the band director said
I had chutzpa.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.008
Guys, I'm done.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.609
Smokey's rock and roll days
are behind him.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.479
Now I'm just an everyday schnook
like you chump stains.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.115
You said you'd put me
on your list

15:48.148 --> 15:51.151
because you denied me
the Smokey Floyd experience.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.986
Now you're doing it again.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.287
To all of us.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.289
You're gonna have to put
all of us on your list.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.125
Brother, at this rate,

15:58.158 --> 16:00.360
you're never gonna finish
crossing off that list.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.196
And we're not the only ones
who are gonna be disappointed.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.965
A lot of people
will be disappointed.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.508
You know, I've never really been
a big believer in karma.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.211
Maybe that's why my life's been
such a mess.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.381
If you guys want to do this,
I'm in.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.318
We're getting the band
back together.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.020
(whooping, cheering)

16:28.388 --> 16:30.390
* When you're in the kitchen

16:30.423 --> 16:32.125
* You've got to behave

16:32.159 --> 16:36.196
* You don't put metal
in the microwave *

16:36.229 --> 16:39.732
* The knobs on the stove
are hands-off, no doubt *

16:39.766 --> 16:42.335
* And if you make toast,
you don't use a knife *

16:42.369 --> 16:45.038
* To fish it out

16:45.072 --> 16:47.374
* When you're alone,
when you're home alone *

16:47.407 --> 16:51.578
* You got to stay safe
when you're home all alone *

16:51.611 --> 16:53.746
* When you're alone

16:53.780 --> 16:55.648
* When you're home alone

16:55.682 --> 16:59.086
* You got to make sure
not to die *

16:59.119 --> 17:01.721
* Or choke
or burn the house down *

17:01.754 --> 17:03.223
* If you fall down and bump...

17:03.256 --> 17:05.225
JIMMY:
Before they knew it, the band

17:05.258 --> 17:06.393
was getting offers all over.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.261
They were a huge hit.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.364
Mom and Dad were finally living
the rock and roll fantasy

17:11.398 --> 17:13.066
they dreamed of
their whole life.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.137
Living on the road,
adoring fans, high fives.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.405
They even had T-shirts.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.241
* When you're home alone

17:21.274 --> 17:26.079
* You got to stay safe
when you're home all alone *

17:26.113 --> 17:28.148
* When you're alone,
when you're home alone... *

17:28.181 --> 17:30.417
And Mom and Dad got something
even Foghat never had,

17:30.450 --> 17:32.785
stars in the produce aisle

17:32.819 --> 17:35.388
of their hometown
grocery store.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.524
You guys, you guys,
you're not gonna believe it.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.626
Someone who saw you at the
Natesville East Diaper-palooza

17:39.659 --> 17:41.361
e-mailed his rich uncle
from Florida

17:41.394 --> 17:43.230
a video of your performance,
and he's flying us in

17:43.263 --> 17:44.631
on his private jet.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.632
Rock and roll!

17:45.665 --> 17:48.268
(cheering, whooping)

17:48.301 --> 17:50.170
This gig is
just the beginning.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.304
You know how many billionaires

17:51.338 --> 17:52.605
want to throw money
at their kids

17:52.639 --> 17:53.873
to make up for their divorces?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.208
Fifty-two.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.409
I don't know
the actual number.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.777
Sixty-two.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.179
Sure, let's go with 62.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.280
We could've gone with 52.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.115
I'm just saying, this could be

18:02.149 --> 18:03.616
the most important
kindergarten graduation party

18:03.650 --> 18:05.185
of your lives.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.586
(sighs)

18:06.619 --> 18:07.787
We're living our
dream, Virginia.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.389
I know.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.891
You can do anything you want
in these private jets.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.626
I put a knife
inside this water bottle,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.228
and nobody even said anything.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.563
We should get Hope a T-shirt

18:16.596 --> 18:18.665
from every Rock and Roll
Cafe we visit.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.267
They might even put our
name up on the wall.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.901
Only this time,
it won't be after the words

18:21.934 --> 18:23.336
"Do not accept checks from..."

18:23.370 --> 18:25.205
(thunder booms)

18:25.238 --> 18:27.307
Oh, snap, what was that?

18:27.340 --> 18:30.277
We're flying
into a dangerous storm.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.645
The good news is I'm one
of the most accomplished pilots

18:32.679 --> 18:34.914
in all of Nigeria.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.283
The bad news is

18:36.316 --> 18:38.151
all controls are in English.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.619
(thunder crashes)

18:39.652 --> 18:41.321
(gasps)

18:41.354 --> 18:43.290
Rock and roll.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.324
(thunder booms, Virginia gasps)

18:44.357 --> 18:46.193
(alarm blares)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
Whoo! Baby!

18:54.801 --> 18:56.203
(thunder crashes)
Ooh! Oh, my God.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.337
Burt, I'm so scared.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.672
Me, too.
And we were almost famous.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.841
Don't be afraid.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.644
We have found a football field
where we can land the plane,

19:04.677 --> 19:06.546
unless they go into overtime.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.881
Then we're going to shoot

19:08.915 --> 19:10.350
for the miniature golf course.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.484
Miniature golf course?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.885
Maybe it's a regular golf course

19:12.919 --> 19:14.654
that just looks tiny
from up here.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.357
If we don't make it,

19:17.390 --> 19:19.692
maybe I never said this enough,

19:19.726 --> 19:20.860
but I love all of you.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.729
You guys
are like family to me.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.332
And if I took an extra dollar
or two out of petty cash,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.367
it's because, well,
you guys don't pay me.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.303
I hit a turtle with my car
four years ago.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.372
I just hit it
and kept driving.

19:32.405 --> 19:36.343
Not a day goes by that I don't
see that cute little face.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.246
My pet, Mr. Turtle, has been
missing for roughly four years.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.313
It was probably him.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.714
I'm sorry.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.982
Oh, that's okay,

19:43.015 --> 19:45.252
because I slept with
your wife Donna.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.253
(thunder crashes)

19:46.286 --> 19:47.554
Me, too.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.356
Me, too.
Damn it!

19:49.389 --> 19:50.890
Why the hell did we do this?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.359
We had everything.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.261
We had the perfect life.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.396
I know,
we made it to grandparents.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.666
Now we'll never see Hope
grow up to be something great,

19:59.699 --> 20:02.835
like the first female astronaut.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.405
We threw it all away,
and for what?

20:05.438 --> 20:07.274
Another rock star gone
before his time.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.009
Like Elvis or Buddy Holly
or Adam Ant.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.011
Adam Ant? He's still alive.
I thought

20:12.044 --> 20:13.946
he died in a helicopter crash
with Billy Idol.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.548
Also still alive.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.384
(thunder crashes)

20:17.417 --> 20:19.286
I'm in
the Witness Protection Program.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.621
I've been sneaking drinks

20:21.654 --> 20:24.257
these last couple weeks.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.592
I used to be a stripper.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.926
Oh, screw it.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.461
I'm married to a
man who's gay.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.297
What?
Just because I had

20:30.330 --> 20:31.964
that dream about Burt

20:31.998 --> 20:34.033
where he was a horse
and I'm riding him bareback

20:34.066 --> 20:35.635
doesn't mean I'm gay.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.471
My therapist says that could
mean any number of things.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.408
(thunder fades,
jet engines whirr smoothly)

20:41.441 --> 20:44.411
(cabin bell chiming)

20:44.444 --> 20:46.546
Thank God above, we're alive!

20:46.579 --> 20:48.348
We're gonna make it.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.248
Sweet relief.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.991
Smokey, this isn't for us.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.627
What do you mean, dude?

21:00.660 --> 21:02.429
As good as it sounds,

21:02.462 --> 21:04.331
we can't travel the
world on a jet with you.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.399
We've realized we have a life
in Natesville,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.968
with our granddaughter,
that's just too important

21:09.001 --> 21:10.303
to miss out on.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.439
So, thanks
for giving us

21:12.472 --> 21:13.840
a rock and roll
experience, Smokey.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.308
You can cross us
off your list.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.681
SMOKEY:
Turns out Burt and Virginia

21:21.714 --> 21:23.650
didn't really want
the rock and roll lifestyle

21:23.683 --> 21:25.652
as much as they thought
they did.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.355
They realized their place
was in Natesville,

21:28.388 --> 21:29.689
raising their granddaughter.
