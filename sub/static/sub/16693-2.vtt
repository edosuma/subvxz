WEBVTT

00:01.211 --> 00:03.032
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS,

00:03.032 --> 00:05.184
CHEF RAMSAY HAS TRAVELED
ALL ACROSS AMERICA...

00:05.184 --> 00:07.196
YOU ARE IN DENIAL.
NO!

00:07.196 --> 00:09.187
AND ENCOUNTERED
SOME MEMORABLE OWNERS...

00:09.187 --> 00:11.239
WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

00:11.239 --> 00:13.180
ONE BEING MORE STUBBORN...

00:13.180 --> 00:14.181
TELLING YOU ONE LAST TIME.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.182
THAN THE NEXT.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.093
IT WAS FRESH, TO THE DAY.

00:17.093 --> 00:18.224
THEY'RE NOT CRAP,
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

00:18.224 --> 00:20.106
WHY DON'T YOU GET THE
OUT OF MY RESTAURANT?

00:20.106 --> 00:21.126
WANT ME TO GO?
I WOULD LOVE YOU TO GO.

00:21.126 --> 00:23.048
BUT TONIGHT,

00:23.048 --> 00:24.049
ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

00:24.049 --> 00:25.230
ARE YOU NUTS?
COMPLETELY.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.191
AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT
IN DENVER...

00:27.191 --> 00:29.123
<i>"DENVER'S BEST PIZZA."</i>

00:29.123 --> 00:30.000
THERE'S A HUGE MISTAKE
ON THE AWNING.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.094
THERE'S A HUGE MISTAKE
ON THE AWNING.

00:31.094 --> 00:33.086
CHEF RAMSAY FACES OFF

00:33.086 --> 00:35.077
AGAINST THE MOST STUBBORN OWNER
HE HAS EVER MET.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.199
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

00:37.199 --> 00:40.071
PETE IS CLEARLY LIVING
IN THE PAST,

00:40.071 --> 00:43.243
CLINGING TO POSITIVE REVIEWS
FROM 20 YEARS AGO.

00:43.243 --> 00:46.116
WE ARE NOT IN 1985, PETE.

00:46.116 --> 00:48.147
HIS WIFE, PAULETTE,
AND SON, JOSH,

00:48.147 --> 00:49.208
HAVE FOUGHT A LOSING BATTLE...

00:49.208 --> 00:50.209
PETE.

00:50.209 --> 00:52.080
GET LOST.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.221
TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO HIM,

00:53.221 --> 00:55.173
BUT PETE SIMPLY REFUSES
TO LISTEN TO THEM...

00:55.173 --> 00:56.203
DAMN IT, DON'T.

00:56.203 --> 00:57.204
OR ANYONE ELSE...

00:57.204 --> 00:58.205
JUST SHUT UP.

00:58.205 --> 01:00.000
INCLUDING CHEF RAMSAY.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.056
INCLUDING CHEF RAMSAY.

01:00.056 --> 01:02.088
YOU'RE SINKING.
NO, I'M NOT.

01:02.088 --> 01:04.160
THE FOOD IS
ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.181
<i>HAVE YOU ANY IDEA</i>
<i>HOW BAD THAT TASTED?</i>

01:06.181 --> 01:08.093
THE PORTIONS ARE ENORMOUS.

01:08.093 --> 01:10.254
IT LOOKS LIKE
A GIANT DIAPER

01:10.254 --> 01:11.245
STUFFED WITH MEATBALLS.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.117
IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING BIGGER

01:13.117 --> 01:14.227
THAN PETE'S EGO...

01:14.227 --> 01:15.238
HOLY CRAP.

01:15.238 --> 01:17.110
IS HIS PIZZA.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.150
<i>I'LL LET YOU TAKE THAT IN.</i>

01:18.150 --> 01:19.251
TONIGHT, CHEF RAMSAY

01:19.251 --> 01:20.242
PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS...

01:20.242 --> 01:22.184
<i>WE ARE NOW</i>

01:22.184 --> 01:23.264
JUST GOING SO FAR BACKWARDS.

01:23.264 --> 01:26.087
AS HE TRIES TO SAVE
A RESTAURANT...

01:26.087 --> 01:27.087
YOU'RE IN DENIAL.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.238
I AM DISAGREEING
WITH YOU.

01:28.238 --> 01:29.279
AND A FAMILY AS WELL.

01:29.279 --> 01:30.000
STOP. STOP!

01:30.000 --> 01:33.262
STOP. STOP!

01:36.114 --> 01:37.115
WHAT IS THAT?

01:37.115 --> 01:39.077
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:39.077 --> 01:40.127
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:40.127 --> 01:41.278
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:41.278 --> 01:43.240
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.271
GET OUT OF HERE!

01:44.271 --> 01:46.122
<i>THAT IS AMAZING.</i>

01:46.122 --> 01:48.254
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!
OH, GOD!

01:48.254 --> 01:51.256
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.240
DENVER, COLORADO,

01:56.240 --> 01:58.141
KNOWN AS THE MILE-HIGH CITY,

01:58.141 --> 02:00.000
IS HOME TO ALMOST
2,500 RESTAURANTS.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.313
IS HOME TO ALMOST
2,500 RESTAURANTS.

02:00.313 --> 02:03.175
LOCATED JUST 7 MILES
FROM THE CITY CENTER

02:03.175 --> 02:04.246
IS PANTALEONE'S,

02:04.246 --> 02:08.199
OPENED IN 1985 BY PETE
AND HIS WIFE, PAULETTE.

02:10.241 --> 02:12.292
I'M FROM AN ISLAND IN GREECE.

02:12.292 --> 02:14.164
WHEN I FIRST GOT
TO THE U.S.,

02:14.164 --> 02:16.285
I WAS A CHEF
IN ANOTHER PLACE,

02:16.285 --> 02:19.258
BUT I WANTED TO BUY A PLACE
OF MY OWN,

02:19.258 --> 02:22.310
BECAUSE MY PIZZA IS THE BEST
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.321
I'M PAULETTE.
<i>PAULETTE?</i>

02:23.321 --> 02:26.233
PETE AND I OWN THIS,
AND WE'RE MARRIED.

02:26.233 --> 02:30.000
WHEN WE FIRST OPENED,
WE DID HAVE WONDERFUL REVIEWS.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.146
WHEN WE FIRST OPENED,
WE DID HAVE WONDERFUL REVIEWS.

02:30.146 --> 02:33.289
WE JUST GOT AWARD
AFTER AWARD AFTER AWARD.

02:33.289 --> 02:36.231
MY SIGNATURE ON THE PIZZA
IS MY CRUST.

02:36.231 --> 02:39.133
BACK IN THE '90s, IT WAS BUSY.

02:39.133 --> 02:41.215
BUT MY GRANDFATHER THINKS
HE'S STILL IN THE '90s.

02:41.215 --> 02:42.326
I THINK MY PIZZA IS AWESOME.

02:42.326 --> 02:45.218
PETE IS STUCK IN A TIME WARP.

02:45.218 --> 02:48.310
I'VE DONE 200 PEOPLE, MAN.
COME ON. BY MYSELF.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.202
THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO.

02:50.202 --> 02:51.322
KIND OF A SLOW LUNCH.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.314
WE USED TO BE PACKED.

02:53.314 --> 02:55.366
NOW WE HAVE NO CUSTOMERS.

02:55.366 --> 02:58.288
I CANNOT PINPOINT
THE REASON.

02:59.369 --> 03:00.000
I'VE BEEN TELLING PETE
FOR YEARS

03:00.000 --> 03:01.150
I'VE BEEN TELLING PETE
FOR YEARS

03:01.150 --> 03:02.321
WE NEED TO CHANGE THINGS,

03:02.321 --> 03:03.312
BUT HE DOESN'T LISTEN.

03:03.312 --> 03:06.264
I'M GETTING SOME BAD FEEDBACK
ON YOUR PIZZA.

03:06.264 --> 03:07.365
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO?

03:07.365 --> 03:09.346
MY FOOD IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

03:09.346 --> 03:11.318
MY TABLE'S SAYING
THAT IT'S TOO SOGGY,

03:11.318 --> 03:13.350
TOO SOFT ON THE DOUGH.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.201
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

03:20.385 --> 03:22.356
PANTALEONE'S HAS
THE WORST PIZZA IN DENVER.

03:22.356 --> 03:26.330
MY GRANDPA'S PIZZA IS LIKE
A WHITEWALL TIRE.

03:28.371 --> 03:29.372
IT'S DISGUSTING.

03:29.372 --> 03:30.000
GOD FORBID, IF YOU SAID

03:30.000 --> 03:31.333
GOD FORBID, IF YOU SAID

03:31.333 --> 03:32.334
ANYTHING ABOUT HIS PIZZA,
FORGET IT.

03:32.334 --> 03:33.355
HE'LL BE LIKE, "AGH,
YOU DON'T KNOW

03:33.355 --> 03:34.356
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT."

03:34.356 --> 03:36.197
THAT'S PRETTY BAD.

03:36.197 --> 03:38.379
JUST SHUT UP.

03:38.379 --> 03:41.211
YOUR VEGGIE PIZZAS--
THEY'RE A LITTLE SOGGY.

03:41.211 --> 03:42.372
OKAY, QUIT--
QUIT WHINING.

03:42.372 --> 03:44.263
I WANT TO CHANGE THINGS

03:44.263 --> 03:46.175
ABOUT THE PLACE,

03:46.175 --> 03:48.236
BUT MY FATHER SHOOTS DOWN
EVERY ONE OF MY IDEAS.

03:48.236 --> 03:49.337
<i>IT'S RIDICULOUS, MAN.</i>

03:49.337 --> 03:50.378
THIS IS YOUR SYSTEM.

03:50.378 --> 03:51.369
REALLY?
YEAH, REALLY.

03:51.369 --> 03:53.270
JUST SHUT UP.

03:53.270 --> 03:56.343
I FEEL FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I WANT
TO HELP MY PARENTS,

03:56.343 --> 03:59.395
BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
THAT I CAN DO TO HELP THEM.

04:04.389 --> 04:06.320
THE RESTAURANT DOES PUT

04:06.320 --> 04:09.203
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS
ON OUR FAMILY.

04:09.203 --> 04:10.384
WE ARE JUST MAKING ENDS MEET.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.296
IF IT KEEPS UP LIKE THIS,
I COULD SEE US

04:13.296 --> 04:15.337
<i>SHUTTING DOWN</i>
<i>IN A YEAR OR SO.</i>

04:15.337 --> 04:17.299
IF WE DON'T GET
THIS RESTAURANT GOING,

04:17.299 --> 04:19.291
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO SELL OUR HOME.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.293
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND JOBS,
AND AT OUR AGE,

04:22.293 --> 04:24.224
THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

04:24.224 --> 04:25.435
WE GOTTA MAKE IT WORK,
OR WE GOTTA GET OUT OF IT.

04:25.435 --> 04:27.237
THAT'S IT.

04:27.237 --> 04:28.428
THIS RESTAURANT
HAS BEEN MY LIFE

04:28.428 --> 04:30.000
FOR THE LAST 28 YEARS.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.260
FOR THE LAST 28 YEARS.

04:31.260 --> 04:34.432
I PUT EVERYTHING IN THIS PLACE
THAT I EVER HAD.

04:34.432 --> 04:36.364
IF THE RESTAURANT FAILS,

04:36.364 --> 04:39.356
IT WILL FEEL LIKE
MY LIFE WAS NOTHING.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.346
<i>PANTALEONE'S. WOW.</i>

04:52.346 --> 04:54.238
<i>"DENVER'S BEST PIZZA."</i>

04:54.238 --> 04:55.438

05:00.000 --> 05:00.332

HEY, CHEF.

05:00.332 --> 05:01.433
I'M EXCITED.
I'M EXCITED TOO.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.275
DENVER'S BEST PIZZA.
THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT.

05:03.275 --> 05:04.415
<i>YOUR FIRST NAME IS?</i>

05:10.300 --> 05:11.351
OH.
THERE HE IS.

05:11.351 --> 05:12.362
THERE HE IS.

05:12.362 --> 05:13.392
HELLO, CHEF.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

05:13.392 --> 05:14.393
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:14.393 --> 05:15.404
WHEREABOUTS IN ITALY
ARE YOU FROM?

05:15.404 --> 05:17.435
I'M NOT ITALIAN.
WHO SAID THAT I AM?

05:17.435 --> 05:19.447
GREEK.
OH, GREEK.

05:19.447 --> 05:20.438
GOT YOU NOW.

05:20.438 --> 05:22.389

<i>THAT'S MY SON.</i>

05:22.389 --> 05:23.470

GOOD, UM, LET'S CATCH UP

05:32.297 --> 05:34.289
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.463
ONE THING ABOUT PETE
THAT I STRUGGLE WITH

05:39.463 --> 05:42.465
IS HIS INABILITY TO CHANGE.

05:42.465 --> 05:45.277
IT IS ABSOLUTELY
HINDERING THINGS.

05:45.277 --> 05:47.499
UM, SO YOU HAVE
THE BEST PIZZA IN DENVER.

05:47.499 --> 05:49.280
I DO.
THAT'S A BOLD STATEMENT.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.311
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:50.311 --> 05:51.402
<i>WHEN DID YOU RECEIVE THAT?</i>

05:51.402 --> 05:52.443

THE BEST PIZZA IN TOWN

05:54.484 --> 05:56.456
SINCE 1985?
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.466
I THINK I DO.

05:57.466 --> 05:58.477
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T THINK I DO.

05:58.477 --> 06:00.000
I KNOW I DO.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.289
I KNOW I DO.

06:01.289 --> 06:03.291
<i>WHERE DID YOU TRAIN?</i>
IN NEW YORK.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.453

06:12.448 --> 06:15.310
MARCH 10TH OF '85--
IT WAS MONDAY--

06:15.310 --> 06:16.391

FOR AN OLD BOY.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.443

ON SUNDAY?

06:40.410 --> 06:41.510
SUNDAY?
YEAH.

06:41.510 --> 06:42.491
BECAUSE I WANT
TO WATCH FOOTBALL.

06:46.394 --> 06:48.326
ARE YOU NUTS?

06:48.326 --> 06:49.457
<i>DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA</i>

HOW MANY PIZZAS GET ORDERED
ON A SUNDAY

06:51.498 --> 06:53.480
JUST IN FOOTBALL SEASON?

06:53.480 --> 06:56.342
WE DID OPEN ON SUNDAY

06:56.342 --> 06:57.513
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:57.513 --> 06:59.384

07:08.381 --> 07:10.383
<i>THE RESTAURANT CLOSES,</i>

HE HAS TO HAVE HIS WHAT?

07:13.485 --> 07:14.526
NAP.
NAP?

07:14.526 --> 07:16.407
A SIESTA. SLEEP.

07:16.407 --> 07:18.479
<i>THAT'S KIND OF</i>
<i>A EUROPEAN THING,</i>

THE RESTAURANT CLOSES
BECAUSE PETE WANTS A NAP?

<i>NO, YOU DON'T DO THAT?</i>

07:28.377 --> 07:29.478
<i>NO.</i>

07:29.478 --> 07:30.000
DO ANY DELIVERY?

07:30.000 --> 07:30.548
DO ANY DELIVERY?

07:30.548 --> 07:31.549
NO.

07:31.549 --> 07:33.541
- WOW.
<i>- YES.</i>

07:33.541 --> 07:34.562
<i>PLUS THERE'S</i>
<i>ANOTHER PROBLEM.</i>

07:34.562 --> 07:36.483
<i>THE OTHER THING'S</i>

07:36.483 --> 07:37.534
YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO ANYO--

07:37.534 --> 07:39.545
I MEAN, YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO ME.

07:39.545 --> 07:41.387
<i>IT'S LIKE IF HE STARTS</i>
<i>DOING SOMETHING</i>

07:41.387 --> 07:43.518
ONE WAY, YOU CAN'T GET HIM
OFF OF IT.

07:43.518 --> 07:46.411
<i>SHE'S A PRINCESS.</i>

07:46.411 --> 07:47.532
MM-MM.

07:47.532 --> 07:49.473
HOW OLD IS JOSH?

07:49.473 --> 07:50.544
33.

07:50.544 --> 07:51.575
AND HE MUST BE
GEARED UP NOW

07:51.575 --> 07:52.545
TO TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS

07:52.545 --> 07:55.398
WHEN YOU TAKE
A BACKSEAT SOMEWHERE.

07:55.398 --> 07:56.529
WELL, IN TERMS OF--
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

07:56.529 --> 07:57.579
<i>IS HE THE HEAD CHEF NOW?</i>

07:57.579 --> 07:58.560
NO.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.000
HE STILL IS.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.371
HE STILL IS.

08:00.371 --> 08:01.572
AS LONG AS I'M IN HERE,
I AM.

08:01.572 --> 08:05.405
OKAY, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT PIZZAS, RIGHT?

08:05.405 --> 08:06.406
DENVER'S BEST PIZZA.

08:07.517 --> 08:08.568
WHAT THE HECK
YOU LAUGHING ABOUT?

08:08.568 --> 08:10.579
WELL--
<i>I WOULD EXPECT</i>

08:10.579 --> 08:14.552
JOSH, BY NOW, LITERALLY
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AT THE HELM.

08:14.552 --> 08:17.485
WHY CAN'T YOU LET GO?

08:17.485 --> 08:18.526
I DON'T KNOW.

08:18.526 --> 08:20.477
WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LET GO?

08:20.477 --> 08:23.469
WHO KNOWS?

08:23.469 --> 08:24.560
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS...
TWO YEARS.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.492
I'VE SEEN IT
ON A DOWNHILL SLIDE.

08:26.492 --> 08:27.563
DECLINE.

08:27.563 --> 08:29.584
AND NOW, LIKE,
A TUESDAY NIGHT,

08:29.584 --> 08:30.000
I MIGHT HAVE TWO TABLES.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.425
I MIGHT HAVE TWO TABLES.

08:31.425 --> 08:32.466
TWO TABLES?

08:32.466 --> 08:34.428
I'VE SEEN IT WITH NO TABLES.
TWO TABLES.

08:34.428 --> 08:35.429
WOW.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.589
<i>NEARLY 30 YEARS OF BUSINESS.</i>

08:36.589 --> 08:38.441
HAVE YOU PUT MONEY AWAY?

08:38.441 --> 08:39.512
NO.

08:39.512 --> 08:41.503
- YOU CAN'T RETIRE?
<i>- NO.</i>

08:41.503 --> 08:44.436
WE GOT INTO TROUBLE.
WE REFINANCED OUR HOME

08:44.436 --> 08:45.446
<i>TWO OR THREE TIMES, AND--</i>

08:45.446 --> 08:46.447
THIS IS CRAZY.

08:46.447 --> 08:48.549
MM-HMM, THAT'S WHAT
I FEEL LIKE.

08:48.549 --> 08:50.510
WOW.

08:50.510 --> 08:53.543
<i>SO I'M GOING TO GET</i>
<i>UP TO SPEED</i>

08:53.543 --> 08:54.603
WITH THE FOOD.

08:54.603 --> 08:56.475
<i>I'M DYING TO TASTE</i>
<i>THAT PIZZA.</i>

08:56.475 --> 08:57.606
I KNOW IT'S LATE
IN THE AFTERNOON,

08:57.606 --> 08:59.567
BUT ARE YOU--YOU GOING
FOR A NAP, OR ARE YOU WITH US?

09:00.578 --> 09:01.599
<i>HE'S STAYING.</i>

09:01.599 --> 09:02.630
OH, HE'S STAYING.
OKAY, JUST--

09:02.630 --> 09:03.650
<i>HE'S STAYING TODAY.</i>
OKAY, GOOD.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.522
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF IT WAS...

09:05.522 --> 09:06.633
NAPTIME.

09:08.544 --> 09:09.595
PAULETTE ALWAYS KNOCKS ME.

09:09.595 --> 09:11.617
SHE THINKS
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING,

09:11.617 --> 09:13.608
WHICH SHE DOESN'T.

09:13.608 --> 09:14.609
HOW'D IT GO?

09:14.609 --> 09:15.650
SHE DIDN'T LET ME
SAY ONE WORD.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.651
JOSH, COME AROUND, BUD.
LET'S CATCH UP.

09:17.651 --> 09:19.603
'CAUSE I'VE DONE IT
FOR 37 YEARS,

09:19.603 --> 09:23.516
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

09:23.516 --> 09:24.597
I DIDN'T REALIZE THINGS WERE
THAT TOUGH FOR MOM AND DAD.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.498
IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN
TO A POINT WHERE

09:26.498 --> 09:28.510
I'M--I'M EMBARRASSED
OF THE PLACE.

09:28.510 --> 09:29.610
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT?

09:29.610 --> 09:30.000
CHANGE IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.632
CHANGE IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

09:31.632 --> 09:33.483
YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH THE PIZZAS?

09:33.483 --> 09:34.584
UM, NO.

09:34.584 --> 09:35.585
WOW.

09:35.585 --> 09:37.547
SO THEY'RE BAD?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

09:37.547 --> 09:39.678
HE SOUNDS LIKE
A VERY STUBBORN MAN.

09:39.678 --> 09:42.470
YEAH. I HAVE
A LOT MORE IDEAS.

09:42.470 --> 09:43.621
HAS HE STARTED TO PASS
THE REINS OVER OR NO?

09:43.621 --> 09:44.672
NO, NO.
SERIOUSLY?

09:44.672 --> 09:46.634
NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WHY IS THAT?

09:46.634 --> 09:49.486
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA MAKE HIM, IF EVER.

09:49.486 --> 09:50.637
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN,

09:50.637 --> 09:51.638
"THREE MORE YEARS,
THREE MORE YEARS."

09:51.638 --> 09:53.509
THAT'S CRAZY.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.551
YEAH, IT IS.
IT'S BEEN REALLY CRAZY.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.631
COMING UP...

09:56.631 --> 09:57.662
HOLY CRAP.

09:57.662 --> 09:58.663
ISN'T THAT RIDICULOUS?

09:58.663 --> 09:59.664
CHEF RAMSAY BEGINS

09:59.664 --> 10:00.000
HIS RESEARCH...

10:00.000 --> 10:00.685
HIS RESEARCH...

10:00.685 --> 10:01.685
<i>IT'S LIKE THE PIZZA</i>

10:01.685 --> 10:03.537
<i>THAT ATE DENVER.</i>

10:03.537 --> 10:04.688
AND DISCOVERS

10:04.688 --> 10:06.679
THE BIGGEST PORTIONS
HE HAS SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

10:06.679 --> 10:09.571
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A GIANT DIAPER.

10:09.571 --> 10:11.663
YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW STUBBORN

10:11.663 --> 10:12.694
PETE REALLY IS.

10:12.694 --> 10:15.506
IT WAS THE WORST PIZZA
IN DENVER.

10:15.506 --> 10:16.507
I DISAGREE WITH YOU.

10:16.507 --> 10:17.538
SO STUBBORN...

10:17.538 --> 10:18.688
I MAY EVEN LEAVE.

10:18.688 --> 10:20.550
THAT HE MAY PUSH HIS FAMILY

10:20.550 --> 10:21.581
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT
FOR GOOD.

10:21.581 --> 10:24.483
I'M OUTTA HERE.

10:30.519 --> 10:32.490
CLEARLY THIS FAMILY IS DIVIDED.

10:32.490 --> 10:35.473
WIFE PAULETTE AND SON JOSH
FEEL THAT THE RESTAURANT

10:35.473 --> 10:37.414
IS STUCK IN THE PAST,

10:37.414 --> 10:39.516
WHILE PETE FEELS THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG

10:39.516 --> 10:41.361
WITH HIS FOOD.

10:41.361 --> 10:42.392
IT'S TIME FOR CHEF RAMSAY

10:42.392 --> 10:44.483
TO FIND OUT FOR HIMSELF.

10:44.483 --> 10:45.484
HOW ARE YOU, DARLING?
I'M GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

10:45.484 --> 10:47.486
SO YOUR FIRST NAME IS?
CELESTINA.

10:47.486 --> 10:48.507
CELESTINA.
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

10:48.507 --> 10:49.567
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE PROBLEMS ARE

10:49.567 --> 10:51.469
WITH THE RESTAURANT?

10:51.469 --> 10:53.480
THERE'S A FEW
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.571
<i>UM, WHEN IT COMES</i>
<i>TO PETE AND PAULETTE,</i>

10:54.571 --> 10:56.593
THEY BUTT HEADS A LOT
ON HOW THINGS SHOULD BE RUN.

10:56.593 --> 10:56.876
<i>SHE WANTS CHANGES,</i>

10:56.876 --> 10:59.435
<i>SHE WANTS CHANGES,</i>

10:59.435 --> 11:01.507
AND PETE WANTS THINGS
HIS WAY.

11:01.507 --> 11:02.587
WOW.

11:02.587 --> 11:04.499
ANYWAY, LET ME HAVE A QUICK
LOOK AT THE MENU.

11:04.499 --> 11:05.490
OKAY.
<i>AND, UM--</i>

11:05.490 --> 11:07.411
OH, THERE'S
A LITTLE LETTER HERE.

11:07.411 --> 11:08.512
<i>"EVERYTHING IS HOMEMADE.</i>

11:08.512 --> 11:10.524
WE COOK FOR YOU
JUST LIKE MAMA DID."

11:10.524 --> 11:12.425
<i>THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.</i>

11:12.425 --> 11:13.526
UM, DARLING, LET'S ORDER.

11:13.526 --> 11:15.457
OKAY.
<i>UM, I WANT TO GO</i>

11:15.457 --> 11:16.498
FOR A SAUSAGE PIZZA, PLEASE.

11:16.498 --> 11:17.499
OKAY.

11:17.499 --> 11:19.511
<i>A TOASTED MEATBALL HERO,</i>

11:19.511 --> 11:21.522
AND PETE'S OWN CALZONE,
AND THEN, UH,

11:21.522 --> 11:23.464
<i>I'LL GO FOR THE LINGUINI</i>
<i>AND CLAM AS WELL.</i>

11:23.464 --> 11:24.585
ALL RIGHTY.
<i>THANK YOU, MY DARLING.</i>

11:24.585 --> 11:26.876
NO PROBLEM.

11:26.876 --> 11:27.427
NO PROBLEM.

11:27.427 --> 11:28.588
<i>MY GOD.</i>

11:28.588 --> 11:30.469
LOOK AT THE DINING ROOM.

11:30.469 --> 11:31.570
<i>I MEAN, HE'S GOT</i>
<i>AS MUCH ATMOSPHERE IN HERE</i>

11:31.570 --> 11:33.541
<i>AS THERE IS</i>
<i>IN A HOSPITAL ROOM.</i>

11:33.541 --> 11:36.554
I MEAN, IT IS SAD.

11:36.554 --> 11:37.504
<i>HERE'S THIS, PETE.</i>

11:37.504 --> 11:39.546
OKEYDOKEY.

11:39.546 --> 11:40.547
OKAY.

11:40.547 --> 11:41.638
I'M NOT NERVOUS
FOR CHEF RAMSAY

11:41.638 --> 11:43.419
TO TASTE MY FOOD.

11:43.419 --> 11:44.460
LET'S DO THIS.

11:44.460 --> 11:45.611
WELL, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY--

11:45.611 --> 11:50.414
HE'S GONNA GO
TO HEAVEN TODAY.

11:50.414 --> 11:51.465
<i>HOW IS IT?</i>

11:51.465 --> 11:52.596
<i>THE MEATBALL SANDWICH?</i>

11:52.596 --> 11:54.558

I'VE HAD BETTER CAT FOOD.

11:58.631 --> 12:00.442

HOLY.

12:06.497 --> 12:08.579
<i>PAULETTE?</i>
<i>YES.</i>

12:08.579 --> 12:10.540
WHAT IS THAT
BEHIND YOUR HEAD?

12:10.540 --> 12:12.602
THAT'S A HOLOGRAM.

12:12.602 --> 12:14.473
FREAKING ME OUT.

12:14.473 --> 12:15.604
YOU KNOW WHAT, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE AFRAID OF THAT.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.595
THAT'S A CLOWN.

12:17.595 --> 12:18.656
<i>OH, GOD.</i>

12:18.656 --> 12:20.438
HOW LONG HAS THAT
BEEN UP THERE?

12:20.438 --> 12:22.459
<i>OH, PROBABLY</i>
<i>ABOUT 15 YEARS.</i>

12:22.459 --> 12:23.650
SO WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?
THAT IS SPOOKY.

<i>THAT'S MINE.</i>

IT'S DONE. IT'S DONE.
DON'T WORRY.

12:36.490 --> 12:39.522
I JUST  CHECKED IT,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS AGO.

12:39.522 --> 12:41.554
IT'S GONNA BURN IN ABOUT--

12:41.554 --> 12:44.566
<i>GET IT OUT.</i>

<i>THANK YOU, DARLING.</i>

<i>I MEAN, THE FILLING'S COLD.</i>

13:34.685 --> 13:36.727
THAT IS HIDEOUS.
<i>I DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER.</i>

13:36.727 --> 13:39.619
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TAKE THAT CALZONE

13:39.619 --> 13:43.562
AND FLING IT LIKE A FRISBEE
FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS.

13:43.562 --> 13:44.633

NOT IN DENVER OR COLORADO--
IN THE COUNTRY.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.711
THAT'S HOW CONFIDENT I AM
ABOUT MY PIZZA.

14:25.705 --> 14:26.876
THANK YOU.

14:26.876 --> 14:28.597
THANK YOU.

14:28.597 --> 14:30.658
MAN.

14:30.658 --> 14:33.701
OH, MY GOD.

14:33.701 --> 14:36.693
DRIPPING IN GREASE.

14:36.693 --> 14:41.567
THE OIL AND THE GREASE
COMING OUT OF THAT.

14:41.567 --> 14:44.689
THE OIL IN THERE.
LOOK AT THE GREASE.

14:44.689 --> 14:47.591
THAT'S GROSS.

14:47.591 --> 14:49.553
HE SAID IT'S TOO GREASY.

14:49.553 --> 14:50.694
JUST EXACTLY
WHAT I FEEL.

14:50.694 --> 14:53.566
OH, SHUT UP.

14:53.566 --> 14:56.709
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

14:56.709 --> 14:56.876
HONESTLY, THE BEST PIZZA
IN DENVER?

14:56.876 --> 14:59.651
HONESTLY, THE BEST PIZZA
IN DENVER?

14:59.651 --> 15:02.563
I MEAN, DOES THAT LOOK
LIKE THE BEST PIZZA?

15:02.563 --> 15:04.685
TRUST ME, I CAN TELL YOU,
IT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD.

15:04.685 --> 15:05.786
<i>CELESTINA, THE DOUGH</i>
<i>IS SO THICK.</i>

15:05.786 --> 15:08.648
WHY--I MEAN, IT'S JUST LIKE
A LOAF OF BREAD.

15:08.648 --> 15:09.669
IT'S LIKE A BAGUETTE
IN THERE.

15:09.669 --> 15:11.630
MM-HMM,
THAT'S OUR THIN CRUST.

15:11.630 --> 15:12.751
THAT'S THE THIN CRUST?

15:12.751 --> 15:13.792
MM-HMM.

15:13.792 --> 15:15.803
STOP.

15:15.803 --> 15:17.695
WOW.
SERIOUSLY?

15:17.695 --> 15:18.756
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE GET UPSET
WITH ME FOR THAT

15:18.756 --> 15:19.776
WHEN THEY ASK
FOR THE THIN CRUST,

15:19.776 --> 15:22.669
AND I BRING THEM
THE THIN CRUST.

15:22.669 --> 15:25.671
WOW. CAN YOU TOUCH THAT?
THE DOUGH IS RAW.

15:25.671 --> 15:26.732
OH, WOW, IT IS.

15:26.732 --> 15:26.876
<i>LIKE A RAW PASTRY.</i>
<i>MY GOD, WHAT A MESS.</i>

15:26.876 --> 15:29.694
<i>LIKE A RAW PASTRY.</i>
<i>MY GOD, WHAT A MESS.</i>

15:29.694 --> 15:31.636
DARLING, I'M DONE.
ALL RIGHTY.

15:31.636 --> 15:32.806
DREADFUL.
OKAY, I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.689
MESSY.

15:35.689 --> 15:36.729
<i>THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT</i>

15:36.729 --> 15:37.730
THE BEST PIZZA
IN DENVER.

15:37.730 --> 15:38.801
LET'S GET THAT RIGHT.

15:38.801 --> 15:40.592
<i>HEY, PETE,</i>

15:40.592 --> 15:42.664
HE WANTED ME TO SHOW YOU
THE DOUGH.

15:42.664 --> 15:43.735
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

15:43.735 --> 15:45.676
<i>HE SAID THE PIZZA WAS</i>
<i>DOUGHY ON THE INSIDE</i>

15:45.676 --> 15:46.807
AND GREASY.

15:46.807 --> 15:48.749
IT IS DOUGHY. LOOK.
REALLY?

15:48.749 --> 15:50.650
<i>I AGREE WITH HIM TOO.</i>

15:50.650 --> 15:51.751
<i>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</i>

15:51.751 --> 15:54.753
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE CHEF IS TALKING ABOUT.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.876
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE IT.
I DO. I EAT IT.

15:56.876 --> 15:57.696
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE IT.
I DO. I EAT IT.

15:57.696 --> 15:58.747
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
THROW THIS AWAY?

15:58.747 --> 15:59.707
LEAVE IT.
I'M GONNA EAT IT.

15:59.707 --> 16:01.759
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT?

16:01.759 --> 16:02.740
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.831
I'M HUNGRY.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.843
I THINK
CHEF RAMSAY'S PROBLEM IS

16:06.843 --> 16:10.646
THAT HE HASN'T TASTED
A CLASSIC PIZZA BEFORE.

16:10.646 --> 16:11.797
DAMN, IT'S GOOD.

16:11.797 --> 16:16.690
HE'S TASTED
ALL THIS FANCY STUFF, YOU KNOW.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.653
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
THIS IS THE MEATBALL HERO.
OH,.

16:20.653 --> 16:22.755
THE MEATBALL HERO.

16:22.755 --> 16:25.747
WOW, AND HOW DO YOU--
HOW WOULD YOU--

16:25.747 --> 16:26.876
UM, I GUESS YOU APPROACH THAT
HOWEVER YOU FEEL.

16:26.876 --> 16:29.700
UM, I GUESS YOU APPROACH THAT
HOWEVER YOU FEEL.

16:29.700 --> 16:30.711
WOW.

16:30.711 --> 16:31.732
<i>THANK YOU, MY DARLING.</i>

16:31.732 --> 16:32.743
NO PROBLEM.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.734
<i>JUST VISUALLY,</i>

16:34.734 --> 16:38.757
THERE'S NOTHING HERO-LOOKING
ABOUT THAT.

16:38.757 --> 16:40.829
GOD.

16:40.829 --> 16:43.781
THAT'S NOT ANYWHERE NEAR
A HERO SANDWICH.

16:43.781 --> 16:46.664
<i>THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE</i>
<i>A SLOPPY JOE.</i>

16:46.664 --> 16:47.794
THIS IS BAD.

16:47.794 --> 16:48.815
IT'S ALL SOGGY THERE.

16:48.815 --> 16:50.647
IT'S LIKE EATING A PATCH

16:50.647 --> 16:52.668
<i>OF SOAKING-WET GRASS</i>

16:52.668 --> 16:53.789
AFTER A COW
ALL OVER IT.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.851
YOU'RE ALL DONE WITH THAT?

16:55.851 --> 16:56.876
THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT
A HERO, YEAH.

16:56.876 --> 16:57.782
THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT
A HERO, YEAH.

16:57.782 --> 16:59.654
ALL RIGHTY.

16:59.654 --> 17:00.724
<i>THERE'S A TYPO ERROR</i>
<i>ON THE MENU.</i>

17:00.724 --> 17:02.826
IT'S NOT "HERO."
IT'S "ZERO."

17:02.826 --> 17:04.728
I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

17:04.728 --> 17:06.769
PLEASE.

17:06.769 --> 17:07.890
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
CHEF'S RESPONSE?

17:07.890 --> 17:09.811
YES.
<i>YES?</i>

17:09.811 --> 17:11.803
HE SAID IT'S A ZERO,
NOT A HERO.

17:11.803 --> 17:13.755
<i>I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.</i>

17:15.696 --> 17:18.668
I HAVE PLENTY OF PEOPLE
THAT THEY LOVE MY MEATBALLS.

17:18.668 --> 17:20.680
I AM VERY PROUD
OF MY MEATBALLS,

17:20.680 --> 17:23.812
AND FOR CHEF RAMSAY
TO SAY IT WAS A ZERO--

17:23.812 --> 17:26.735
IT'S VERY INSULTING.

17:33.516 --> 17:34.597
CHEF RAMSAY HAS STARTED

17:34.597 --> 17:37.439
SAMPLING THE MENU
AT PANTALEONE'S,

17:37.439 --> 17:40.402
AND WHILE PETE CLAIMS HIS FOOD
IS THE BEST IN DENVER,

17:40.402 --> 17:41.562
CHEF RAMSAY HAS DISCOVERED...

17:41.562 --> 17:43.404
HOLY CRAP.

17:43.404 --> 17:44.605
IT'S ANYTHING BUT,

17:44.605 --> 17:47.547
WITH GIGANTIC PORTIONS,
GREASY PIZZA,

17:47.547 --> 17:49.379
AND TASTELESS DISHES.

17:49.379 --> 17:51.440
<i>IT'S NOT HERO.</i>
<i>IT'S ZERO.</i>

17:51.440 --> 17:53.382
<i>JOSH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i>
<i>JOSH.</i>

17:53.382 --> 17:56.414
LET THE--
LET THE GARLIC ROAST.

17:56.414 --> 17:57.485
<i>ROAST YOU.</i>

17:57.485 --> 17:58.516
<i>REALLY?</i>

17:58.516 --> 17:59.586
I'M GONNA WHACK YOU
OVER THE HEAD

17:59.586 --> 18:00.841
WITH THIS DAMN THING.

18:00.841 --> 18:02.459
WITH THIS DAMN THING.

18:02.459 --> 18:04.430
<i>LET IT GET REALLY HOT</i>
<i>BEFORE YOU PUT 'EM IN.</i>

18:04.430 --> 18:06.452
<i>IS THIS THE FIRST TIME</i>
<i>I'VE DONE THIS?</i>

18:06.452 --> 18:08.453
I DON'T AGREE AT ALL

18:08.453 --> 18:10.415
WITH SERVING ANYTHING
OUT OF A CAN.

18:10.415 --> 18:12.426
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.458
WAIT TILL HE TASTES
THIS.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.560
HERE.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.402
OKAY, HERE'S THE LINGUINI.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.453
WOW, WOW, WOW.
THANK YOU.

18:21.453 --> 18:24.456
NO PROBLEM.

18:26.587 --> 18:30.460
MM. DAMN.

18:30.460 --> 18:30.841
<i>I MEAN, THAT IS</i>
<i>ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL.</i>

18:30.841 --> 18:32.622
<i>I MEAN, THAT IS</i>
<i>ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL.</i>

18:32.622 --> 18:34.493
NO SEASONING.

18:34.493 --> 18:36.645
BLAND, LIKE A PLATE
OF HOSPITAL FOOD.

18:36.645 --> 18:40.518
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
SO UNAPPETIZING.

18:40.518 --> 18:42.440
LOOK AT THAT.
EXCESS WATER.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.501
I MEAN, THAT IS DISGUSTING.

18:44.501 --> 18:49.485
MAN.

18:49.485 --> 18:52.647
HOW'S IT GOING?

18:52.647 --> 18:55.660
IT LOOKS LIKE PETE
TOOK A  IN MY PASTA.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.631
<i>THAT'S BAD.</i>

18:59.493 --> 19:00.841
OH, IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT HE WAS
DOING RIGHT NOW.

19:00.841 --> 19:02.655
OH, IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT HE WAS
DOING RIGHT NOW.

19:02.655 --> 19:06.478
UGH.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.599
YOU ALL DONE WITH THAT?

19:07.599 --> 19:08.600
YEAH.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.651
<i>THANK YOU, DARLING.</i>

19:09.651 --> 19:11.622
NO PROBLEM.

19:11.622 --> 19:13.484
THAT'S LIKE
ONE OF THE WORST URINE SAMPLES

19:13.484 --> 19:15.455
YOU COULD EVER GIVE.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.476
<i>GROSS.</i>
THANK YOU.

19:16.476 --> 19:19.538
HORRIBLE.

19:19.538 --> 19:20.659
HEY, JOSHUA.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.670
WHAT'D HE SAY?

19:21.670 --> 19:23.581
HE WAS VERY, VERY NOT HAPPY
WITH IT.

19:23.581 --> 19:25.653
THERE WERE A LOT OF COMMENTS.

19:25.653 --> 19:28.635
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.841
RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY PERSON
IN HERE THAT'S HAPPY

19:30.841 --> 19:31.658
RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY PERSON
IN HERE THAT'S HAPPY

19:31.658 --> 19:35.591
IS THAT STUPID  CLOWN
ON THE WALL.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.572
AGH.

19:37.572 --> 19:38.613
THAT WAS BAD.

19:38.613 --> 19:40.494
YOU GOTTA TAKE IT, MAN.

19:40.494 --> 19:42.496
YOU GOTTA--HAVE TO TAKE IT.

19:42.496 --> 19:44.568
THERE'S A REASON THIS PLACE
ISN'T DOING GOOD RIGHT NOW.

19:44.568 --> 19:45.648
LET'S COME AROUND.

19:45.648 --> 19:47.570
OKAY.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.662
37 YEARS, SINCE I CAME

19:49.662 --> 19:52.484
IN THIS COUNTRY, I'VE BEEN
WORKING IN THE KITCHENS,

19:52.484 --> 19:54.635
AND I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

19:54.635 --> 19:56.527
UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

19:56.527 --> 19:58.528
<i>MY FIRST TIME IN DENVER,</i>

19:58.528 --> 20:00.600

20:00.600 --> 20:00.841
I'VE EVER HAD.

20:00.841 --> 20:02.602
I'VE EVER HAD.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.614
<i>FIRST OF ALL,</i>
<i>THE CLAMS WERE DREADFUL.</i>

SERIOUSLY?

20:08.676 --> 20:09.717
YES.

20:09.717 --> 20:11.649
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
HOW BAD THAT TASTED?

20:11.649 --> 20:12.669
<i>IT'S HOW HE'S</i>

20:12.669 --> 20:14.511

20:14.511 --> 20:15.522
WERE THEY CANNED?

20:15.522 --> 20:16.612
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

20:16.612 --> 20:17.723
<i>WHAT?</i>

20:17.723 --> 20:18.724
WHY ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

20:18.724 --> 20:20.515

20:20.515 --> 20:21.556
<i>YOU MENTION ON THE MENU</i>

20:21.556 --> 20:22.667
THAT EVERYTHING'S FRESH
AND HOMEMADE

20:22.667 --> 20:24.519
LIKE MAMA DID.

20:24.519 --> 20:25.539
IT'S ALWAYS FRESH MADE.

20:25.539 --> 20:26.580
I DON'T THINK THE INGREDIENTS

20:26.580 --> 20:29.662
ARE QUITE AS--
AS FRESH ANYMORE.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.841
AND THEN THE BIG DISASTER,

20:30.841 --> 20:33.525
AND THEN THE BIG DISASTER,

20:33.525 --> 20:34.566
MY SAUSAGE PIZZA.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.559
<i>IT WAS DRIPPING IN GREASE.</i>

20:37.559 --> 20:38.709
<i>THE DOUGH WAS SO THICK,</i>

20:38.709 --> 20:40.671
<i>PARTS OF IT</i>
<i>WERE UNDERCOOKED.</i>

20:40.671 --> 20:43.573

20:43.573 --> 20:44.664
<i>I THINK I HAVE</i>

20:49.568 --> 20:50.539
<i>I MEAN, YOU NEED TO GO</i>

20:58.565 --> 21:00.841
WE ARE NOT IN 1985, PETE.

21:00.841 --> 21:01.547

21:05.600 --> 21:07.582

21:10.734 --> 21:12.596

21:12.596 --> 21:14.607

I DISAGREE WITH YOU

21:28.578 --> 21:29.579
<i>WOULD YOU MIND?</i>

21:31.580 --> 21:32.671
PETE IS EXTREMELY SET

21:32.671 --> 21:33.712

21:33.712 --> 21:35.644
BUT HE'S GOT TO LISTEN
TO SOMEBODY,

21:35.644 --> 21:36.704
OR WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

21:36.704 --> 21:38.646

HE NEEDS THIS.

21:38.646 --> 21:40.597
I KNOW, AND HE'S RIGHT
ON EVERY DAMN THING...

21:40.597 --> 21:42.739
HE IS RIGHT.
HE SAID.

21:42.739 --> 21:44.761
<i>PETE, YOU'RE IN DENIAL.</i>

21:44.761 --> 21:46.612
<i>THAT'S THE PROBLEM.</i>

21:51.716 --> 21:55.599
YOU'RE JUST GOING FURTHER

21:55.599 --> 21:57.600
<i>AND IT'S NOT MAKING</i>
<i>ANYBODY HAPPY.</i>

21:57.600 --> 21:59.692
IT'S NOT GIVING
YOUR WIFE AND YOUR FAMILY

21:59.692 --> 22:00.841
A BIT OF FREEDOM.

22:00.841 --> 22:01.594
A BIT OF FREEDOM.

22:01.594 --> 22:05.757
IT'S JUST FEEDING YOUR EGO.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.738
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

22:07.738 --> 22:10.761
YOU'RE SINKING.

YOU'RE TAKING EVERYBODY ELSE
ON THE BOAT WITH YOU.

22:13.643 --> 22:16.645
NO, I'M NOT.

22:18.637 --> 22:22.750
THE PIZZA IS NOT GOOD.

22:22.750 --> 22:25.662
I'M STILL GONNA DISAGREE
WITH YOU.

22:25.662 --> 22:27.684
I REALLY WILL.

22:27.684 --> 22:30.841
I'M SORRY, BUT I AM.

22:30.841 --> 22:31.707
I'M SORRY, BUT I AM.

22:31.707 --> 22:32.758
I NEED SOME FRESH AIR.

22:32.758 --> 22:35.650
OKAY, CHEF.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.772
MAN.

22:39.643 --> 22:40.814
<i>MAN.</i>

22:40.814 --> 22:43.636
I DON'T THINK
I'M DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

22:43.636 --> 22:45.658
STUBBORN.

22:45.658 --> 22:46.839
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 37 YEARS.

22:46.839 --> 22:49.811
CHEF RAMSAY WAS A KID
WHEN I FIRST STARTED COOKING.

22:49.811 --> 22:53.644
I SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN HE DOES.

22:58.688 --> 22:59.749
<i>HE'S RIGHT ON EVERYTHING</i>
<i>HE SAID.</i>

22:59.749 --> 23:00.841
EVERY  THING HE SAID,
HE'S RIGHT.

23:00.841 --> 23:01.730
EVERY  THING HE SAID,
HE'S RIGHT.

23:01.730 --> 23:04.662
THE PIZZA EVEN,
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU--

23:04.662 --> 23:05.683
EVERYTHING THAT HE TOLD YOU--
I'VE BEEN SAYING

23:05.683 --> 23:07.725
THE SAME , THOUGH.

23:07.725 --> 23:08.856
LIKE WHAT?
I SAID PIPE THE CRUST DOWN.

23:08.856 --> 23:10.627
IT'S TOO  MUCH.

23:10.627 --> 23:12.769
GIVE ME A--.

23:12.769 --> 23:14.640
DOES IT TAKE HIM
TO TELL YOU THAT

23:14.640 --> 23:17.642
TO ACTUALLY LISTEN
OR WHAT?

23:19.814 --> 23:22.686
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

23:22.686 --> 23:25.779
THE FOOD IS.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.641
IT REALLY IS.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.712
WHAT, ARE YOU CRYING?

23:29.712 --> 23:30.841
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

23:30.841 --> 23:32.704
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

23:32.704 --> 23:35.706
IT'S  FRUSTRATING.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.709
I DID THE BEST I COULD

23:38.709 --> 23:40.650
OVER THE YEARS.

23:40.650 --> 23:44.823
WELL, IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
ANYMORE.

23:44.823 --> 23:48.736
I'M COMING OUT FOR A MINUTE.

23:48.736 --> 23:49.817
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:49.817 --> 23:51.749
<i>I'VE REALIZED</i>
<i>THAT IT WAS LIKE THIS</i>

23:51.749 --> 23:53.660
<i>FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.</i>

23:53.660 --> 23:54.791
AND I BEEN NAGGING
AND SCREAMING

23:54.791 --> 23:57.793
AND CARRYING ON.

23:57.793 --> 23:58.884
THIS PLACE EITHER CHANGES,

23:58.884 --> 24:00.746
OR YOU'RE GONNA LOCK
THE  DOORS AND--

24:00.746 --> 24:00.841
OH, I'M--I'M DONE.

24:00.841 --> 24:01.807
OH, I'M--I'M DONE.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.708
IF YOU DON'T CHANGE
AND DO WHAT HE SAYS,

24:03.708 --> 24:05.730
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME
IN THIS PLACE AGAIN,

24:05.730 --> 24:07.801
AND I DON'T GIVE
TWO FLYING YOU-KNOW-WHATS

24:07.801 --> 24:10.793
<i>WHAT HAPPENS</i>
<i>TO EVERYTHING I OWN.</i>

24:10.793 --> 24:11.864
YOU'LL BE HERE BY YOURSELF.

24:11.864 --> 24:14.727
EVERYBODY CALM DOWN.

24:14.727 --> 24:15.707
<i>YEAH, YEAH, CALM DOWN, RIGHT?</i>

24:15.707 --> 24:16.748
RIGHT.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.730
I DON'T THINK
THAT I NEED TO CHANGE.

24:18.730 --> 24:20.691
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

24:20.691 --> 24:23.683
JOSHUA AND PAULETTE
DO NOT UNDERSTAND

24:23.683 --> 24:25.765
ABOUT RUNNING THIS PLACE.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.687
I GOT MORE EXPERIENCE

24:27.687 --> 24:30.719
THAN THE BOTH OF THEM
PUT TOGETHER.

24:30.719 --> 24:30.841
SO...
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

24:30.841 --> 24:33.881
SO...
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

24:45.033 --> 24:46.084
AFTER SEEING HOW STUBBORN

24:46.084 --> 24:47.234
PETE WAS
ABOUT HIS FOOD...

24:47.234 --> 24:50.107
THE PIZZA IS NOT GOOD.

24:50.107 --> 24:51.207
I'M STILL GONNA
DISAGREE WITH YOU.

24:51.207 --> 24:52.238
AND HIS CLAIM THAT HE HAS

24:52.238 --> 24:54.240
THE BEST PIZZA
IN THE CITY,

24:54.240 --> 24:57.082
CHEF RAMSAY KNEW
HE HAD TO DO SOMETHING

24:57.082 --> 24:58.263
TO FINALLY GET
THROUGH TO HIM.

24:58.263 --> 25:01.065
WE'RE GOING TO BE TASTING
THREE MARGHERITA PIZZAS.

25:01.065 --> 25:02.256
SO HE HEADED DOWNTOWN...

25:02.256 --> 25:03.217
IT WAS KIND OF
A LITTLE MUSHY.

25:03.217 --> 25:05.088
TOO MUCH CHEESE.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.259
TO DO
A LITTLE ORGANIZED RESEARCH.

25:06.259 --> 25:10.202
THANK YOU, GUYS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

25:10.202 --> 25:10.896
NOW ARMED WITH THE FINDINGS
FROM THE TASTE TEST...

25:10.896 --> 25:12.244
NOW ARMED WITH THE FINDINGS
FROM THE TASTE TEST...

25:12.244 --> 25:13.245
MORNING.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.255
KALIMERA, <i>CHEF.</i>

25:14.255 --> 25:16.077
CHEF RAMSAY RETURNS

25:16.077 --> 25:18.198
TO PANTALEONE'S
TO CONFRONT PETE

25:18.198 --> 25:20.260
WITH THE RESULTS.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.191
ONE THING THAT IS
VERY CLEAR--

25:22.191 --> 25:24.203
<i>I THINK, PETE,</i>

25:24.203 --> 25:28.246
YOU HAVE OVERESTIMATED
HOW GOOD YOUR PIZZA IS.

25:28.246 --> 25:29.267
<i>I DON'T THINK</i>

25:29.267 --> 25:31.278
YOU'VE EVER COMPARED IT
TO WHAT'S HAPPENING

25:31.278 --> 25:33.250
<i>IN DENVER RIGHT NOW.</i>

25:33.250 --> 25:36.262
SO AFTER MY DISAPPOINTING
LUNCH YESTERDAY,

25:36.262 --> 25:39.225
<i>I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH</i>
<i>IN DENVER.</i>

25:41.266 --> 25:42.307
HOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU
STAND UP

25:42.307 --> 25:44.088
AND COME STAND
OVER HERE, PLEASE?

25:44.088 --> 25:45.169
<i>YEP.</i>

25:45.169 --> 25:46.200
AND...

25:46.200 --> 25:48.172
<i>HERE IT COMES.</i>

25:48.172 --> 25:50.213
PETE, IT'S NOW TIME
TO REALLY FIND OUT HOW GOOD

25:50.213 --> 25:52.245
YOUR PIZZAS ARE.

25:52.245 --> 25:53.245
THERE'S THREE PIZZAS
IN FRONT OF ME,

25:53.245 --> 25:54.306
"A," "B," "C."

25:54.306 --> 25:57.269
<i>"A" IS FROM ONE OF THE BEST</i>
<i>RESTAURANTS IN TOWN.</i>

25:57.269 --> 25:59.190
<i>"B" IS YOUR PIZZA.</i>

25:59.190 --> 26:01.132
<i>AND "C" IS</i>

26:01.132 --> 26:03.273
A STORE-BOUGHT,
LOCAL FROZEN PIZZA.

26:03.273 --> 26:06.226
TIME TO PUT YOUR PIZZA
TO THE TEST.

26:06.226 --> 26:08.217
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOUR PIZZA'S "B."

26:08.217 --> 26:09.218
WHICH WAS YOUR FAVORITE?
I LIKED "A."

26:09.218 --> 26:10.229
I'D SAY "A."

26:10.229 --> 26:10.896
I LIKED THE "A"
BECAUSE IT WAS THIN.

26:10.896 --> 26:12.310
I LIKED THE "A"
BECAUSE IT WAS THIN.

26:12.310 --> 26:14.102
AND YOUR LEAST FAVORITE?
"B."

26:14.102 --> 26:15.272
"B."
"B."

26:15.272 --> 26:16.273
WHY "B"?

26:16.273 --> 26:17.274
IT'S SOGGY ON THE CRUST.

26:17.274 --> 26:19.256
WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE.
IT OVERWHELMED EVERYTHING ELSE.

26:19.256 --> 26:20.256
I FELT MY HEART STOP.

26:20.256 --> 26:21.307
IT WAS TOO MUCH.
TOO MUCH?

26:21.307 --> 26:24.229
TOO MUCH ON THE CRUST.
THE CRUST WAS SOGGY.

26:24.229 --> 26:26.331
IT WAS JUST NOT VERY GOOD.

26:26.331 --> 26:29.123
<i>OKAY, PETE,</i>

26:29.123 --> 26:30.204
HERE'S THE RESULTS
IN A NUTSHELL.

26:30.204 --> 26:32.306
75% OF OUR TASTE TESTERS

26:32.306 --> 26:33.306
<i>PREFERRED PIZZA "A"</i>

26:33.306 --> 26:36.139
<i>FROM THE TOP LOCAL</i>
<i>ITALIAN RESTAURANT.</i>

26:36.139 --> 26:38.170
IN SECOND PLACE,
WITH 15% OF THE VOTES,

26:38.170 --> 26:40.332
WAS THE STORE-BOUGHT,
FROZEN PIZZA,

26:40.332 --> 26:40.896
AND IN THIRD AND LAST POSITION
WAS YOURS,

26:40.896 --> 26:42.323
AND IN THIRD AND LAST POSITION
WAS YOURS,

26:42.323 --> 26:46.246
WITH 10% ONLY OF THE VOTES.

26:46.246 --> 26:48.268
<i>YOURS WAS THE LEAST FAVORITE.</i>

26:48.268 --> 26:49.319
YOU'RE ACTUALLY BEATEN

26:49.319 --> 26:51.340
BY A STORE-BOUGHT
FROZEN PIZZA.

26:51.340 --> 26:55.133
GET THE MESSAGE?

26:55.133 --> 26:56.174
WOW.

26:56.174 --> 26:58.316
<i>YEAH, WOW.</i>

26:58.316 --> 27:00.347
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL, PAULETTE?
<i>BAD.</i>

27:00.347 --> 27:02.139
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED,

27:02.139 --> 27:03.330
<i>'CAUSE I'VE BEEN SAYING</i>
<i><i><i>THE SAME THING:</i></i></i>

27:03.330 --> 27:05.201
TOO MUCH CHEESE,
TOO MUCH CRUST,

27:05.201 --> 27:07.353
TOO MUCH EVERYTHING.

27:07.353 --> 27:08.354
I'VE TALKED AND TALKED
AND TALKED

27:08.354 --> 27:10.896
ABOUT THE SAME THINGS,

27:10.896 --> 27:11.216
ABOUT THE SAME THINGS,

27:11.216 --> 27:14.298
AND I DON'T SEE IT CHANGING.

27:14.298 --> 27:16.340
IT'S REALLY BAD.
IT NEEDS TO CHANGE.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.251
<i>I THINK THAT, UM,</i>

27:18.251 --> 27:19.342
<i>IN HIS MIND,</i>

27:19.342 --> 27:21.344
IT'S ALWAYS "MORE IS BETTER."

27:21.344 --> 27:25.197
I DO PUT A LOT
OF INGREDIENTS IN.

27:25.197 --> 27:28.249
YOUR PIZZAS ARE DATED.

27:28.249 --> 27:30.301
I AM VERY SURPRISED
AT THE RESULTS OF THE VIDEO.

27:30.301 --> 27:32.322
I NEVER THOUGHT
IN MY WILDEST DREAMS

27:32.322 --> 27:33.383
THAT THE PEOPLE OF DENVER

27:33.383 --> 27:37.276
WOULD PICK A FROZEN PIZZA
OVER MY PIZZA.

27:37.276 --> 27:39.368
YOU HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND

27:39.368 --> 27:40.896
YOU ARE MILES AWAY
FROM SERVING

27:40.896 --> 27:42.320
YOU ARE MILES AWAY
FROM SERVING

27:42.320 --> 27:45.292
DENVER'S BEST PIZZA.

27:45.292 --> 27:49.225
THAT 1991 REVIEW BEHIND ME

27:49.225 --> 27:50.276
<i>IS NO LONGER VALID.</i>

27:50.276 --> 27:52.177
<i>WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT ERA.</i>

27:52.177 --> 27:55.390
YOU'VE TAKEN THE PRAISE
OF A LOCAL CRITIC,

27:55.390 --> 27:57.191
<i>IT'S GONE TO YOUR HEAD,</i>

27:57.191 --> 27:59.273
AND YOU HAVE LOCKED IN

27:59.273 --> 28:00.274
WHAT THEY SAID WAS GOOD,

28:00.274 --> 28:02.205
AND YOU'VE KEPT DOING IT

28:02.205 --> 28:06.348
FOR NEARLY 30  YEARS.

28:06.348 --> 28:07.409
CAN YOU THREE JUST GIVE ME
TWO MINUTES,

28:07.409 --> 28:10.341
GET SOME FRESH AIR
OUTSIDE?

28:10.341 --> 28:10.896
'CAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT.

28:10.896 --> 28:12.283
'CAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT.

28:12.283 --> 28:14.355
I'VE GOT ONE VERY IMPORTANT
QUESTION FOR YOU.

28:14.355 --> 28:16.416
AM I WILLING TO CHANGE?

28:16.416 --> 28:19.198
THAT'S THE ONE.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.239
NO.

28:26.384 --> 28:27.405
<i>YOU REALIZE, LIKE,</i>

28:27.405 --> 28:29.346
HOW EMBARRASSING IT'S BEEN
THE LAST THREE YEARS

28:29.346 --> 28:31.288
TO WORK FOR OTHER PEOPLE

28:31.288 --> 28:33.409
WHILE WE HAVE A RESTAURANT?

28:33.409 --> 28:35.231
<i>THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF...</i>

28:35.231 --> 28:36.342
- THIS STUFF.
- THIS.

28:36.342 --> 28:38.373
I'VE BEEN IN HERE
WAITING TABLES,

28:38.373 --> 28:39.424
<i>AND MY KNEES ARE SHOT.</i>

28:39.424 --> 28:40.896
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT ANYMORE,

28:40.896 --> 28:41.225
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT ANYMORE,

28:41.225 --> 28:42.386
AND I'M SERIOUS WITH YOU.

28:42.386 --> 28:44.408
I MEAN I MAY EVEN LEAVE.

28:44.408 --> 28:46.229
I AM OUTTA HERE.

28:46.229 --> 28:47.290
<i>I'M ACTUALLY...</i>

28:47.290 --> 28:48.351

TO MY LAST JOB.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.443
READY TO HEAD TO TEXAS,
'CAUSE I'M DONE.

28:57.368 --> 28:58.399
<i>I PULLED WITH YOU.</i>

28:58.399 --> 29:00.230
I'VE BEEN YOUR PARTNER.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.462
YOU HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN MINE,
BUT I HAVE BEEN YOURS.

29:02.462 --> 29:07.245
AND I WANT YOU NOW
TO STEP UP,

29:07.245 --> 29:08.346
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE MY HOME

29:08.346 --> 29:10.896
AND THE FEW LITTLE THINGS
THAT I HAVE.

29:10.896 --> 29:12.409
AND THE FEW LITTLE THINGS
THAT I HAVE.

29:12.409 --> 29:16.373
I DON'T WANT YOU TO.

29:16.373 --> 29:18.334
<i>PETE,</i>

29:18.334 --> 29:21.346
ARE YOU COMMITTED?

29:26.410 --> 29:27.411

<i>YOU ARE?</i>

29:28.412 --> 29:29.413
<i>I AM.</i>

29:29.413 --> 29:31.294
100%?

29:31.294 --> 29:33.276
YES, SIR.
I AM READY TO CHANGE.

29:33.276 --> 29:34.276
I AM.

29:34.276 --> 29:35.277
CAN YOU?

29:35.277 --> 29:36.368
YES.

29:36.368 --> 29:38.340
WELL, I HOPE SO.

29:43.303 --> 29:44.354
PETE IS A CREATURE
OF HABIT,

29:44.354 --> 29:45.485
AND IT'S GONNA BE HARD
FOR HIM

29:45.485 --> 29:47.477
TO CHANGE
AND BREAK HABITS.

29:47.477 --> 29:50.479
I WANT TO SEE IT.

29:58.475 --> 30:00.297
THE COMBINATION

30:00.297 --> 30:01.427
OF CHEF RAMSAY'S TASTE TEST...

30:01.427 --> 30:03.339
YOURS WAS THE LEAST FAVORITE.

30:03.339 --> 30:04.410
<i>YOU'RE ACTUALLY BEATEN</i>

FROM HIS FAMILY...

30:08.413 --> 30:10.464
I MAY EVEN LEAVE.

30:10.464 --> 30:11.495
HAS RESULTED

30:11.495 --> 30:13.327
IN A COMMITMENT FROM PETE...

30:13.327 --> 30:14.397
I AM READY TO CHANGE.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.448
TO ACCEPT CHANGE.

30:15.448 --> 30:18.320
BUT BEFORE ANY PHYSICAL CHANGES
ARE MADE

30:18.320 --> 30:20.452
TO THE RESTAURANT
OR TO THE FOOD,

30:20.452 --> 30:22.414
CHEF RAMSAY WANTS
TO BRIDGE THE GAP

30:22.414 --> 30:23.917
BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.476
BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON.

30:25.476 --> 30:28.398
HERE WE ARE
WITH ONE, TWO,

30:28.398 --> 30:31.521
<i>THREE GENERATIONS</i>
<i>WORKING IN THIS BUSINESS.</i>

30:31.521 --> 30:33.432
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT

30:33.432 --> 30:35.524
VERY.
<i>VERY.</i>

30:35.524 --> 30:37.445
SO LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING

30:37.445 --> 30:40.307
ABOUT A UNIQUE
ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

30:40.307 --> 30:42.529
IT'S IN NEW YORK.

30:42.529 --> 30:44.471
IT'S CALLED RAO'S.

30:53.458 --> 30:53.917
YOU CANNOT GET IN THERE.

30:53.917 --> 30:55.519
YOU CANNOT GET IN THERE.

30:55.519 --> 30:57.321
<i>JOSH, HOW DOES THAT SOUND?</i>

32:30.453 --> 32:31.604
FRANKIE, HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

32:31.604 --> 32:33.425
CHEF GORDON, HOW ARE YOU?

32:33.425 --> 32:34.526
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

32:34.526 --> 32:36.437
WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US.

32:36.437 --> 32:37.478
ABSOLUTELY.
THIS IS PETE.

32:37.478 --> 32:38.549
HI, PETE.
FRANK PELLEGRINO.

32:38.549 --> 32:40.400
WELCOME TO RAO'S.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.401
THANK YOU.
COME ON, LET'S GO

32:41.401 --> 32:42.532
INTO OUR DINING ROOM.

32:42.532 --> 32:43.603
LET'S GO.

32:45.544 --> 32:47.406
FOUR GENERATIONS
IN YOUR FAMILY?

32:47.406 --> 32:48.577
YES, I'M THE FOURTH GENERATION.

32:48.577 --> 32:50.578
CAN YOU GIVE A LITTLE INSIGHT
IN TERMS OF HOW--

32:50.578 --> 32:52.410
<i>ABSOLUTELY.</i>
HOW THIS HAS HAPPENED?

32:52.410 --> 32:53.917
I GREW UP UNDER THE TUTELAGE
OF MY FATHER,

32:53.917 --> 32:55.592
I GREW UP UNDER THE TUTELAGE
OF MY FATHER,

32:55.592 --> 32:57.524
AND I HAD TO LEARN

32:57.524 --> 33:01.417
HOW TO REALLY BECOME
OPEN-MINDED AND WILLING

33:01.417 --> 33:03.428
<i>TO COMMUNICATE...</i>

33:03.428 --> 33:04.599
MM-HMM.
IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY.

33:04.599 --> 33:06.450
MM-HMM.

33:06.450 --> 33:07.571
<i>AND IF YOU HAVE</i>
<i>THAT STRONG RELATIONSHIP</i>

33:07.571 --> 33:09.533
<i>AND CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER,</i>

33:09.533 --> 33:12.495
THAT WILL ONLY REFLECT
IN YOUR BUSINESS,

33:12.495 --> 33:13.556
AND WHO'S REALLY GONNA
PICK UP ON THAT

33:13.556 --> 33:15.427
ARE YOUR GUESTS.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.479
IF THERE WAS
A STRONG KEY MESSAGE TO JOSH,

33:17.479 --> 33:19.561
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE,
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

33:19.561 --> 33:20.591
<i>TRUTHFULLY,</i>

33:20.591 --> 33:22.623
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

33:22.623 --> 33:23.917
IS THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE
WITH YOUR DAD.

33:23.917 --> 33:25.465
IS THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE
WITH YOUR DAD.

33:25.465 --> 33:27.607
I AGREE WITH FRANK THAT
THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP

33:27.607 --> 33:29.448
IS WITH MY FATHER.

33:29.448 --> 33:31.470
AND I HOPE
MY FATHER CAN SEE,

33:31.470 --> 33:34.442
IF WORKING TOGETHER,
HOW SUCCESSFUL WE CAN BECOME.

33:34.442 --> 33:35.553
ARE YOU READY TO TRY
SOME STUNNING FOOD?

33:35.553 --> 33:37.484
YES.
<i>WE ARE.</i>

33:37.484 --> 33:38.605
I AM SO THANKFUL TO CHEF RAMSAY

33:38.605 --> 33:41.608
TO BRING ME OVER HERE
AND OPEN MY EYES

33:41.608 --> 33:42.678
AND MY MIND.

33:42.678 --> 33:44.570
I CAN SEE WHY
THEY'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS

33:44.570 --> 33:45.581
FOR OVER 100 YEARS.

33:45.581 --> 33:46.582
<i>ABSOLUTELY.</i>

33:46.582 --> 33:51.535
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

33:51.535 --> 33:52.616
I'M GOING TO REMEMBER
THIS NIGHT

33:52.616 --> 33:53.917
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

33:53.917 --> 33:55.458
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.582
ONE NIGHT TOGETHER IN VEGAS

34:00.582 --> 34:03.625
HAS CLEARLY BROUGHT JOSH
AND PETE TOGETHER AGAIN.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.526
AND WHILE THEY
HAVE BEEN AWAY,

34:05.526 --> 34:07.638
CHEF RAMSAY GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT
TO HIS TEAM

34:07.638 --> 34:11.611

34:11.611 --> 34:14.493

THE WILD MUSHROOM PIZZA.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.761
THE LASAGNA, PLEASE.

38:30.761 --> 38:31.792
WONDERFUL.

38:31.792 --> 38:32.853
<i>ALL RIGHT, LADIES.</i>

38:32.853 --> 38:33.854
<i>DID I GIVE YOU</i>
<i>ENOUGH TIME TO DECIDE?</i>

38:33.854 --> 38:33.918

38:33.918 --> 38:35.845
I'M GOING TO GET
THE BRUSCHETTA.

38:35.845 --> 38:37.707
<i>THE BRUSCHETTA.</i>
THANK YOU.

<i>YOU'RE VERY WELCOME, LADIES.</i>

38:38.777 --> 38:39.778
<i>ORDER ON, PLEASE, PETE.</i>

38:39.778 --> 38:40.779
LET'S GO.

38:40.779 --> 38:41.910
EGGPLANT PARM, THE LASAGNA--

38:41.910 --> 38:43.741
JUST GIVE ME
THE  TICKET, PAPA.

38:43.741 --> 38:44.832
YOU CAN'T JUST STAND THERE
AND TALK LIKE THAT, DUDE.

38:44.832 --> 38:45.883
WELL, I MEAN--

38:45.883 --> 38:46.904
<i>COME ON, JOSH.</i>

38:46.904 --> 38:48.715
GET 'EM READY AND FIRE THEM.
SHUT UP.

38:48.715 --> 38:49.716
LET ME DO THE--

38:49.716 --> 38:50.827
<i>I'VE GOT MY THING. STOP.</i>

38:50.827 --> 38:51.898
<i>WHAT ELSE IS ON THAT TICKET?</i>

38:51.898 --> 38:53.879
DON'T JUST START THROWING
PIZZAS IN, NOW.

38:53.879 --> 38:55.821
<i>YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT I'M DOING, DO YOU?</i>

38:55.821 --> 38:57.792
HEY, PETE,
HOW LONG FOR 16?

38:57.792 --> 38:58.903
WHAT 16?

38:58.903 --> 39:00.724
<i>16 IS ALREADY GONE.</i>

39:00.724 --> 39:02.726
JOSH, IS THIS DONE OR WHAT?

39:02.726 --> 39:03.697
<i>I DON'T KNOW.</i>

39:03.697 --> 39:03.918
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:03.918 --> 39:04.788
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:04.788 --> 39:05.788
ALTHOUGH DINNER SERVICE

39:05.788 --> 39:06.919
HAS JUST BEGUN,

39:06.919 --> 39:08.821
PETE IS ALREADY OVERWHELMED
WITH ORDERS...

39:08.821 --> 39:10.912
<i>WHERE'S THE 16, DAMN IT?</i>

39:10.912 --> 39:12.754
<i>PAPA, YOU'RE NOT TALKING</i>
<i>TO ME, MAN,</i>

39:12.754 --> 39:13.805
AND WE'RE MISSING TIMES HERE.

39:13.805 --> 39:14.835
AND IS NOT COMMUNICATING

39:14.835 --> 39:16.857
EFFECTIVELY WITH JOSH.

39:16.857 --> 39:18.718
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THE  WE ARE.

39:18.718 --> 39:20.730
LISTEN, I WANT SOME HARMONY
IN HERE, A LITTLE BIT, YEAH?

39:20.730 --> 39:21.811
THE FATHER-AND-SON TEAM

39:21.811 --> 39:23.732
ARE CONFUSING EACH OTHER,

39:23.732 --> 39:26.795
AND ALMOST NO FOOD
HAS LEFT THE KITCHEN.

39:26.795 --> 39:28.826
WHERE'S THIS GOING?
I NEED A TABLE NUMBER ON THIS.

39:28.826 --> 39:29.857
<i>OKAY, LASAGNA</i>

39:29.857 --> 39:30.948
AND LINGUINI ALLA VODKA, RIGHT?

39:30.948 --> 39:33.720
<i>WHERE'S THE LINGUINI</i>
<i>ALLA VODKA?</i>

39:33.720 --> 39:33.918
I DON'T HAVE THAT.

39:33.918 --> 39:34.761
I DON'T HAVE THAT.

39:34.761 --> 39:35.742
WHERE'S THE LINGUINI
ALLA VODKA?

39:35.742 --> 39:37.753
NOT EVEN STARTED.

39:37.753 --> 39:40.815
REALLY? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

39:40.815 --> 39:41.816
PUT THE  THING OUT.

39:41.816 --> 39:43.748
WHATEVER, MAN.

39:43.748 --> 39:44.809
<i>STOP!</i>

39:44.809 --> 39:46.810
YOU, YOU, COME HERE.

39:46.810 --> 39:49.762
URGENTLY, NOW.

39:49.762 --> 39:50.853
I--

39:50.853 --> 39:51.854
I WANT TO GIVE UP.

39:51.854 --> 39:53.755
<i>WE ARE NOW</i>

39:53.755 --> 39:55.827
JUST GOING
SO FAR BACKWARDS.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.789
HAVE WE COME THIS FAR NOW
TO GIVE UP?

39:57.789 --> 39:58.889
NO.

39:58.889 --> 40:00.771
TABLE 16,
THIS HASN'T GONE.

40:00.771 --> 40:02.953
WHEN A TICKET'S GONE,
IT GETS  SPIKED.

40:02.953 --> 40:03.918
YES, CHEF.

40:03.918 --> 40:04.744
YES, CHEF.

40:04.744 --> 40:06.916
LET'S REGROUP,
AND THEN WE FOCUS ON 16.

40:06.916 --> 40:08.847
OKAY.
LET'S GO. IN.

40:08.847 --> 40:09.918
CHEF IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

40:09.918 --> 40:11.769
I HAVE TO TAKE A BREATH

40:11.769 --> 40:13.751
AND START DOING
A TICKET AT A TIME.

40:13.751 --> 40:17.844
<i>TABLE 16, LASAGNA,</i>
<i>LINGUINI VODKA, JOSH.</i>

40:17.844 --> 40:18.845
COMING UP RIGHT NOW.

40:18.845 --> 40:19.896
<i>NICE. TAKE YOUR TIME.</i>

40:19.896 --> 40:20.906
WHAT'S GOING NEXT?

40:20.906 --> 40:23.779
THEN I NEED
AN EGGPLANT PARMESAN

40:23.779 --> 40:24.779
<i>AND A SMALL MEAT LOVERS.</i>

40:24.779 --> 40:25.760
<i>OKAY, HEARD.</i>

40:25.760 --> 40:26.881
GET YOUR SYSTEMS GOING.
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

40:26.881 --> 40:27.882
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH

40:27.882 --> 40:29.833
CHEF RAMSAY'S PEP TALK

40:29.833 --> 40:30.904
HAS DONE THE TRICK.

40:30.904 --> 40:32.936
BOTH PETE AND JOSH
ARE CLEARLY MORE FOCUSED.

40:32.936 --> 40:33.918
TABLE 16.

40:33.918 --> 40:34.827
TABLE 16.

40:34.827 --> 40:35.968
THEY ARE NOW ABLE

40:35.968 --> 40:37.810
TO CONTROL THE ORDERS

40:37.810 --> 40:38.910
AND GET DELICIOUS,
QUALITY FOOD OUT

40:38.910 --> 40:40.912
IN A MORE ORGANIZED MANNER.

40:40.912 --> 40:43.864
I LOVE THEIR MUSHROOM PIZZA.
IT WAS SO GOOD.

40:47.827 --> 40:50.830
TABLE THREE,
CAPELLINI, EGGPLANT PARMESAN.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.801
EGGPLANT PARM,
CAPELLINI HEARD.

40:52.801 --> 40:53.972
<i>ALL RIGHT, THAT'S MY BOY.</i>

40:53.972 --> 40:56.804
WE GOT THAT SMALL BIANCA,
AND THEN WE'RE DONE.

40:56.804 --> 40:57.915
SMALL BIANCA,
AND WE'RE DONE.

40:57.915 --> 40:59.977
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE PETE CHANGE.

40:59.977 --> 41:02.789
I THINK HE'S MORE OPEN
TO LISTENING

41:02.789 --> 41:03.918
AND WORKING WITH HIS FAMILY.

41:03.918 --> 41:03.920
AND WORKING WITH HIS FAMILY.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.971
I'M REALLY PROUD OF HIM.
VERY MUCH SO.

41:05.971 --> 41:07.833
HIGH FIVE.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.794
WE WHUPPED ASS TONIGHT.

41:09.794 --> 41:10.845
<i>WHOO!</i>

41:10.845 --> 41:13.847
<i>AT 61, I CAN STILL DO IT, BABY.</i>

41:13.847 --> 41:17.830
TONIGHT WE HAD A ROCKY TIME
IN THE KITCHEN.

41:17.830 --> 41:20.813
<i>BUT WE DEALT WITH IT.</i>

41:20.813 --> 41:21.964
YOU NOW HAVE A PLAN.

41:21.964 --> 41:24.856
<i>PICK UP THE REINS</i>
<i>AND RUN WITH IT.</i>

41:24.856 --> 41:26.817
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF, YEAH?

41:26.817 --> 41:27.908
RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.
AHH.

41:27.908 --> 41:29.039
ABSOLUTELY.
DIG IN NOW.

41:29.039 --> 41:30.881
MY DARLING.
I LOVE YOU, CHEF.

41:30.881 --> 41:32.842
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:32.842 --> 41:33.918
CHEF RAMSAY
REALLY INSPIRED US.

41:33.918 --> 41:34.954
CHEF RAMSAY
REALLY INSPIRED US.

41:34.954 --> 41:36.035
LOOK AFTER YOUR BOYS.
I WILL.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.827
AND HOPEFULLY PETE AND JOSH

41:38.827 --> 41:40.858
CAN DO EVEN BETTER
AND TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

41:40.858 --> 41:41.999
I'VE GOT TO GO.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.881
THANK YOU.

41:43.881 --> 41:46.873
CHEF RAMSAY IS
A REMARKABLE, REMARKABLE MAN.

41:46.873 --> 41:48.925
I AM GRATEFUL
AND THANKFUL TO HIM

41:48.925 --> 41:50.946
FOR COMING HERE
AND OPENING MY EYES.

41:50.946 --> 41:52.858
TAKE CARE, YOU.

41:52.858 --> 41:55.039
I LOVE YOU, YOU OLD BRIT.

41:58.852 --> 42:00.003
IN ALL MY YEARS
OF DOING <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,</i>

42:00.003 --> 42:02.855
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MET
A MORE LOVABLE CHARACTER

42:02.855 --> 42:03.896
THAN PETE.

42:03.896 --> 42:03.918
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED,

42:03.918 --> 42:05.838
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED,

42:05.838 --> 42:07.859
HIS HEART MAY HAVE BEEN
IN THE RIGHT PLACE,

42:07.859 --> 42:08.980
BUT HIS HEAD
CERTAINLY WASN'T.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.032
AND FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS,

42:11.032 --> 42:12.943
THE GUY WAS DOING
THE SAME THING EVERY DAY,

42:12.943 --> 42:16.876
DESPITE HIS BUSINESS
GOING DOWNHILL.

42:16.876 --> 42:18.868
BUT I AM TRULY HONORED
TO HAVE HELPED

42:18.868 --> 42:20.079
THIS WONDERFUL,
APPRECIATIVE MAN

42:20.079 --> 42:22.891
TO FINALLY SEE THE LIGHT.

42:22.891 --> 42:24.952
FOR PETE'S SAKE,

42:24.952 --> 42:27.915
I SINCERELY HOPE
THAT PANTALEONE'S

42:27.915 --> 42:29.976
CONTINUES TO BE SUCCESSFUL

42:29.976 --> 42:32.969
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

42:38.012 --> 42:39.894
IN THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED,

42:39.894 --> 42:41.895
PETE REMAINED COMMITTED
TO THE STANDARDS

42:41.895 --> 42:43.877
SET BY CHEF RAMSAY.

42:43.877 --> 42:45.757
JOSH, YOU GOT
LINGUINI ALLA VODKA

42:45.757 --> 42:47.657
AND A SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALL
COMING UP?

42:47.657 --> 42:49.727
YES, I'M READY
WHENEVER YOU ARE.
OKAY.

42:49.727 --> 42:50.817
AND THE NEW MENU

42:50.817 --> 42:53.727
HAS ALREADY RECEIVED
POSITIVE REVIEWS

42:53.727 --> 42:55.727
FROM NOT ONLY CUSTOMERS
INSIDE THE RESTAURANT...

42:55.727 --> 42:56.787
THAT'S GOOD.

42:56.787 --> 42:57.847
BUT OUTSIDE AS WELL.

42:57.847 --> 42:59.647
<i>HERE YOU GO.</i>
<i>KEEP THE CHANGE.</i>

42:59.647 --> 43:00.707
THANK YOU.
UH-HUH.

HAVE A NICE DAY.
