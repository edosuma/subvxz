04:26.600 --> 04:30.554
- Legs need exercise. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.900
Huh? Come on over here.
Let's sit with Mr. Hollingworth.

04:46.704 --> 04:51.165
This is our indoor therapy pool. You'll
probably be doing most of your work in here.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.544
None of our patients can
really stand the sun. Millie.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.747
Yes, Miss Bunweill?

04:58.299 --> 05:01.050
This is Pinky Rose. She'll
be starting with us today.

05:01.051 --> 05:01.618
Hi.

05:01.644 --> 05:03.886
I want you to get her
a suit and a locker...

05:03.887 --> 05:05.972
and show her the routine the
way you did with Alcira.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.391
Okay, but I got Mr. Shaw
for after lunch.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.311
Peggy can take over for you.
Millie's one of our best girls.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.646
- She'll show you how simple it really is.
- Okay.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.724
Okay, after lunch.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.069
- What'll I do till then?
- You can have lunch in the café...

05:20.070 --> 05:22.155
and meet Millie in the
locker room afterwards.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.240
I wanna see you before
you leave tonight.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.784
Ten more and you're finished.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.946
Yep.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.081
Just keep 'em movin'.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.741
You could do some of these,
too, Mr. Hollingworth, you know?

05:34.767 --> 05:35.501
I've done 'em.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.087
- No, it doesn't.
- It's $100 a day.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.591
- No, it's $50 a day.
- Since when?

05:41.592 --> 05:46.179
I'm savin' for one of those new microwave
ovens I've been readin' about.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.473
You can cook a hot dog
in three minutes.

05:48.474 --> 05:53.019
I like mine burned crisp, and you can
set it to burn food just like ya like it.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.271
I've already got 43 and
a half books saved up.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.482
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.484
I think I'll have the...
chicken-fried steak with gravy.

06:51.787 --> 06:55.748
You know the Breck girl? Well, they're
havin' a contest to find a new one...

06:55.749 --> 06:57.834
and I'm gonna send
my best picture in.

06:57.835 --> 07:01.153
Hi. I'm Pinky. Remember me?

07:01.179 --> 07:04.791
- At lunch?
- That wasn't me.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.761
- I thought you had the day off.
- I did.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.180
Old Big-Buns called me in
to work for her.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.433
Mmm, sorry.
I gotta break in a new girl.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.689
I don't know why she picks me.
There's nothin' to teach.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.691
That's probably why.

07:21.692 --> 07:24.277
- Do you guys know how to play Scrabble?
- No.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.731
It's a real good game. You can
learn a lot of new words.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.200
My roommate's got this boyfriend
who's really good at it.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.202
What's that supposed to mean?

07:33.203 --> 07:35.204
He knows some words
I've never even heard of before.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.582
- Well, they say they want a receptionist.
- "Orator."

07:37.583 --> 07:40.251
- It's in the dictionary, all right.
- Two of 'em or one?

07:40.252 --> 07:41.913
- Two.
- I think it's some kind of...

07:41.939 --> 07:43.713
oh, professional
talker or something.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.965
- That's where I could've worked.
- You're too short.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.843
But the most unusual one
was "zebus."

07:48.844 --> 07:50.595
- You know what zebus are?
- No.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.388
- The humps on a camel's back.
- Ohh.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.558
I didn't like the guy that I
was with too much, though.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.561
All he wanted to do
was make up dirty words.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.806
We weren't gonna play that way.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.025
- You know what we had for dinner?
- What'd you have?

08:04.026 --> 08:06.068
Tuna casserole. I cooked it.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.696
- Was it any good?
- Yeah.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.131
I got this whole book of
recipes that I'm keepin'.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.326
And I list 'em by how
long they take to make.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.496
You know, if you only have 20 minutes,
you just look under 20 minutes...

08:16.497 --> 08:19.957
and it tells ya all the kind of things
that you can make in that amount of time.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.119
That makes sense.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.254
It's real good.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.758
It's really not a book, but a kind
of file with times marked on it.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.760
You don't say.

08:30.761 --> 08:34.889
- Pretty good.
- Uh-huh. Couldn't improve it...

08:34.890 --> 08:37.808
Oh, um... Polly, this is Pinky.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.852
Pinky, that's Polly.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.895
- Hi, Millie.
- Hi.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.440
- It is Pinky, isn't it?
- Yeah.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.477
- Okay, let's go get you a suit that fits.
- Okay.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.905
You ever worked in these
kind of places before?

08:50.906 --> 08:53.199
No. This is my first job
in California.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.953
They're not very big
with the salaries here. Oof.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.906
- You're a little like me, aren't ya?
- Yeah.

09:00.958 --> 09:04.460
This looks like
it's about as best as we can do.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.191
Why don't you put this on?
I'll wait for you outside.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.523
Okay.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.805
After you've checked the list in the morning,
you'll know who you're supposed to have.

09:15.806 --> 09:19.058
There'll be a time
written right by each name.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.520
You'll meet 'em here and
they'll give you their cards.

09:22.521 --> 09:27.942
Okay, suppose you got Mr. Shaw and it says,
on his card, uh, "Mineral pool and rest."

09:27.943 --> 09:30.486
Well, you get him
to enter the water right away.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.489
Ten minutes is the max, though,
like it says on that wall.

09:33.490 --> 09:37.368
Then you get him out, wrap him up
and put him on a chaise lounge...

09:37.369 --> 09:42.081
and he's gotta stay there for at least
20 minutes before he can go back in.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.333
Now, you're gonna
play the patient...

09:44.334 --> 09:46.335
and I'm gonna take ya in.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.879
First we gotta take off
our robes and our shoes.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.759
Okay. Robe. Take off our shoes.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.422
Okay, now, what's wrong with ya?

09:59.182 --> 10:00.606
Nothin'?

10:00.632 --> 10:03.528
Well, there's gotta be
somethin' wrong with ya.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.522
- My bathing suit's too big?
- No.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.270
I mean, why else would you be here if
it weren't somethin' like your legs

10:10.296 --> 10:13.863
or your arms or... There's gotta
be somethin' wrong with ya.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.490
Oh, my back! Oh, my back.

10:16.491 --> 10:21.037
- And my leg. My leg. My leg hurts.
- Okay, your back and your legs.

10:21.038 --> 10:24.790
- This is for people with bad backs and legs.
- Thank you.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.369
Now, you're gonna have to take
it real slow and easy now.

10:27.395 --> 10:29.462
Okay.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.583
- We don't want you to get hurt.
- Okay.

10:34.676 --> 10:38.805
- Just be careful 'cause it's real slippery.
- Okay.

10:39.806 --> 10:44.302
Just take it easy.

10:47.648 --> 10:51.359
- Okay.
- Doesn't that feel good?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.645
Mm-hmm.

10:55.781 --> 10:59.033
- Oh, it's hot.
- Come on back up.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.278
It's 106 degrees.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.914
You know, my grandmother had
a bad back and leg, too.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.117
- She did?
- Yeah.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.383
Okay, now, do you wanna stoop
and get all the way in?

11:15.384 --> 11:17.802
I don't know. Am I supposed to?

11:17.803 --> 11:20.605
Not you. That's what you're
supposed to ask them.

11:20.631 --> 11:21.305
Oh.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.641
- You have to kind of humor 'em.
- Oh.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.110
Sort of talk 'em into what
they're supposed to do.

11:26.136 --> 11:30.941
- Yeah.
- Okay, now, follow me.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.536
I don't believe it.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.017
If Bunweill had seen that
you'd be in hot trouble.

11:47.043 --> 11:48.791
You said all the way.

11:48.792 --> 11:53.546
Well, now let's go do
some exercises over here.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.583
It's okay.

11:57.843 --> 12:01.004
Now we're gonna exercise
these hurt legs.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.106
What's the matter? Haven't
ya ever seen twins before?

12:27.956 --> 12:30.293
These are our individual hot tubs.

12:30.319 --> 12:33.002
The water comes directly
from the springs to here.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.254
And over here ya got
your rest area.

12:35.255 --> 12:39.300
They probably won't let ya work the tubs
until you've been here a week or two.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.343
There's really nothin' to it...

12:41.344 --> 12:44.805
but ya just gotta know when
somebody's gettin' a bad reaction.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.583
Sometimes they can't get
out by themselves, and

12:47.609 --> 12:50.186
if you leave 'em in too
long they could die.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.229
- They could die?
- Yeah. Uh-oh.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.273
About that floater
we had yesterday...

12:54.274 --> 12:56.776
Oh, Graham, I don't
know how that happened.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.861
Took her blood pressure
and she was fine.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.905
Next she's floating
face down in the pool.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.704
Is our, uh, malpractice premium

13:02.730 --> 13:04.617
- for this quarter paid?
- Yeah.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.203
- Lammoreaux?
- Yes, Dr. Maas?

13:07.204 --> 13:10.873
- How is Miss Rose doing?
- Just fine, Dr. Maas.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.168
Well, good. You two should,
uh, get along very well.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.046
- Don't you have something in common?
- What?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.590
I don't know. Aren't you both
from Texas or something?

13:19.591 --> 13:21.699
Couldn't you find a suit
that fits you better, Rose?

13:21.725 --> 13:22.635
Oh, yeah.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.720
- No, ma'am.
- Well, try.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.056
Vivian, have you
ever been to Texas?

13:27.057 --> 13:29.391
- Is your name Lammoreaux?
- Uh-huh.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.394
- You French?
- Nah, I'm American.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.189
- Are you from Texas?
- Yeah, near Longview. You?

13:35.190 --> 13:39.276
I'm from Houston, but I've been in
California for about three years now.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.063
You can have this locker
right over here next to mine.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.735
Thank you.

14:16.022 --> 14:20.192
Here's your card, Rose. Do not
punch in until you are dressed.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.083
Same thing in the evening
when you punch out.

14:22.109 --> 14:24.822
You punch first, change
after and be punctual.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.983
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.347
The Wurtzes went to Hawaii
on a real ocean liner.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.349
Like the kind you see
on The Late Show.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.810
They brought me a whole pamphlet
full of color pictures.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.313
They had a lei for me, too, but...

15:39.314 --> 15:41.516
it wilted by the time
they got here.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.486
It's all so colorful and exotic.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.042
Everything from the sky at
sunset to the Hilton Hotel.

15:48.068 --> 15:51.075
- It's too hot there.
- Someday I'm gonna go there.

15:51.076 --> 15:54.286
A boyfriend of mine used to live there.
He even dated a hula dancer.

15:54.287 --> 15:58.374
You wouldn't believe some stories
I've heard about hula dancers.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.502
They're real exotic, too.

16:01.503 --> 16:05.839
You can take hula dancin' lessons
now down at Macy's Salon of Dance.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.051
I might do it. I like it.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.428
It's only $12.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.840
I think it's sexy.

17:39.142 --> 17:43.020
All you get is a bunch of
lettuce and a taco shell.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.606
- Lettuce is right. You won't gain weight.
- That's not nutrition.

17:45.607 --> 17:49.852
- A little bit of beans...
- But that gives you gas.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.569
There you are, Rose. Who's
breaking you in, Alcira or Doris?

18:32.570 --> 18:35.489
- Millie Lammoreaux.
- Did she show you the tubs?

18:35.490 --> 18:38.617
- I saw them.
- Did she show you the routine in the tubs?

18:38.618 --> 18:42.204
- I think I know what to do.
- You do, do you?

18:42.205 --> 18:45.124
Alcira will show you. In case I
don't see her, you tell her.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.210
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am. Is Millie here?

18:48.211 --> 18:52.832
Millie most definitely is not here, and
I need every girl I've got tomorrow.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.722
- Is he asleep?
- Probably.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.058
Can he hear us?

19:03.059 --> 19:05.894
- His hearing aid's out.
- Oh.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.689
How long have you known Millie?

19:08.690 --> 19:11.066
Millie?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.728
- You know, Millie Lammoreaux?
- Mmm.

19:14.737 --> 19:18.490
I don't know.
A few months, I suppose. Why?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.777
I don't know. Just wondered.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.746
She sure is nice, isn't she?

19:24.747 --> 19:27.909
I don't see her too much.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.171
Just seems like she always does
everything right.

19:32.172 --> 19:36.383
Doris, the Chinese one?
She and I are best friends.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.555
Wonder where she is today.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.841
We don't like the twins.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.979
You'll learn about
them soon enough.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.140
Hope she's not sick.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.898
I sure do miss her.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.764
Miss Lombardi? You asleep?

21:57.442 --> 21:59.602
Guess you are.

22:04.240 --> 22:09.077
And she came into my room with a whole
bushel basket full of tomatoes.

22:09.078 --> 22:14.374
I hardly ever dream about her, but when I
do, she's always bringin' me somethin'.

22:14.375 --> 22:19.087
But tomatoes?
I don't even like tomatoes.

22:19.088 --> 22:23.675
Whenever I cook spaghetti I just cook
it with butter and garlic and salt.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.761
Can't understand it.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.846
You all ready for your bath?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.890
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.552
Just be real careful.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.472
I haven't seen her since I was 11.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.775
But tomatoes?

22:39.776 --> 22:43.437
I mean, why would my
mother bring me tomatoes?

22:44.781 --> 22:49.242
Okay, you just stay right
here and I'll be right back.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.988
I have to go to the
little girls' room.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.634
Okay, Miss Lombardi, you wait
right here. I'll be right back.

23:05.635 --> 23:08.337
Gotta go to the little girls' room.

23:12.642 --> 23:17.979
- Hi, Millie. Remember me, Pinky?
- Sure I do.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.817
Where you been the last couple of days?
I thought maybe you were sick.

23:21.818 --> 23:25.404
No, my roommate moved in with
her boyfriend. I had to help 'em.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.816
- All the way to Riverside.
- Oh.

23:29.826 --> 23:33.328
- Wanna go to lunch with me?
- It's okay with me.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.455
They had really good
tamales yesterday.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.853
They were canned but tasted...

23:36.879 --> 23:39.060
- just like Texas to me...
- Uh-oh.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.384
- Rose.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.845
- You left Miss Lombardi alone.
- Only for a minute.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.431
I wanna see you in my office
before you go to lunch.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.051
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:01.816 --> 24:06.020
It won't happen
again, Miss Bunweill.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.222
Have you seen Millie?

24:08.248 --> 24:09.448
- No.
- Wanna have lunch?

24:09.449 --> 24:12.451
- No, I'm supposed to eat with Millie.
- She eats at the hospital.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.453
I don't think this is good
enough for her. Right, Alcira?

24:14.454 --> 24:16.496
No interns here. That's for sure.

24:16.497 --> 24:17.555
The hospital?

24:17.581 --> 24:20.810
Across the street, but
it costs twice as much.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.800
Say, there's a pool where I live and
I don't have a roommate anymore.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.219
So why don't y'all come
over for dinner one night?

24:31.220 --> 24:34.014
We could play a great
game of Scrabble.

24:34.015 --> 24:38.018
I've got this new recipe I've been wantin'
to try out. It's called penthouse chicken.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.062
You make it with a can
of tomato soup.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.767
Takes a whole hour to cook, but
believe me, it's worth it.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.737
- Say, would you check my glands for me?
- What?

24:48.738 --> 24:50.856
My neck glands.

24:52.241 --> 24:56.696
- They've really been swollen all week.
- They look like they're fine.

24:57.997 --> 25:02.034
Are you sure? I've really been
feeling sluggish a lot lately.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.774
What's a French dip sandwich?

25:05.800 --> 25:09.549
A French roll with beef
and juice on the side.

25:09.550 --> 25:15.555
- Would you like one?
- I'll just take melon... or pie.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.225
Oh, I forgot to tell
you about dessert.

25:18.226 --> 25:22.604
We're having banana pops.
You ever had those before?

25:22.605 --> 25:25.383
They're frozen bananas
dipped in hot chocolate,

25:25.409 --> 25:29.694
and then before they get too dry you roll
'em around real quick in Rice Krispies.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.947
Read about it in McCall's.

25:31.948 --> 25:35.609
They give you a whole bunch of recipes
you can make with Rice Krispies.

25:36.827 --> 25:41.073
- Hi, Morley.
- Hi.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.960
Good enough.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.546
What are you reading?

25:47.547 --> 25:49.631
The want ads.

25:49.657 --> 25:52.467
What for? You're not gonna
change jobs, are ya?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.803
For my wife.

25:54.804 --> 25:59.008
- What does she want?
- A new sofa.

26:00.935 --> 26:04.435
I just got a new sofa, too.
Actually it's an old sofa,

26:04.461 --> 26:08.042
but I repainted it and re-covered
it and everything so it looks new.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.656
- You lookin' for anything else?
- No.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.325
- A gun for your wife?
- Mm-hmm.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.528
Last week.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.250
Instructed her. Took her
out on the shooting range.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.753
She feels safe now.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.415
Guess I better be goin'.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.384
See ya later.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.921
Sure was nice talkin' to you guys.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.300
I'll probably see ya tomorrow.

26:44.604 --> 26:49.107
- Judith Goldstein, 6181.
- Bye.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.861
Judith Goldstein, 6181.

26:52.862 --> 26:56.941
- Quiet lady, very quiet.
- That's good for you.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.410
I think you're a fool.

27:00.411 --> 27:03.622
- This peach pie is really stale.
- Bye.

27:03.623 --> 27:07.910
Wonder if they'd give me a
fresh piece if I took it back.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.497
You're really a fool.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.967
She feels protected
by the gun, right?

27:15.968 --> 27:20.055
She felt totally
intimidated. Boy...

27:20.056 --> 27:24.844
- Do you like yellow and purple?
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.728 --> 27:29.731
They're my favorite colors.
Like irises.

27:29.732 --> 27:33.652
I love irises. I love flowers.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.821
And candlelight.
They're so romantic.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.592
It's a surefire way to
win a man in one night.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.785
Oh.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.828
Good atmosphere and food.

27:43.829 --> 27:49.243
You remember that old sayin'? "The way to
a man's heart is through his stomach."

27:50.252 --> 27:52.413
Well, it's true a lot of times.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.794
Boy, it sure was lucky for
me you needed a roommate.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.102
Ooh! What is this place?

28:07.103 --> 28:09.729
Disneyland?

28:09.730 --> 28:13.858
Nah, it's a bar.
This is my hangout.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.821
Lot of guys hang out here, too.

28:15.847 --> 28:19.607
- Mostly cops.
- Oh, a tepee! Oh!

28:20.825 --> 28:23.201
Oh, great. Come on.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.038
A miniature golf course! Oh!

28:27.039 --> 28:29.749
I love miniature golf!

28:29.750 --> 28:32.661
I do, too, but it's been
closed for years. Come on.

28:35.923 --> 28:39.050
Look, Millie. They
caught up with me.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.010
- God.
- They caught up with me.

28:41.011 --> 28:44.052
Come on, will ya? I told
ya there's cops in here.

28:44.078 --> 28:45.999
Oh. Oh. Cops.

28:46.100 --> 28:50.145
Let's go get a beer
and see who's here.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.147
You'll like it. It's
air-conditioned.

28:55.818 --> 29:00.940
Looks deserted. Some of the guys are
probably out back ridin' dirt bikes, though.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.819
Yep.

29:21.844 --> 29:24.179
What's that?

29:24.180 --> 29:29.051
Oh. That's just Willie. She paints
those weird things all over the place.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.247
She paint this, too?

29:50.273 --> 29:52.832
Yeah. It's a sand
paintin' with bullet holes.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.703
- Want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.812
You hadn't seen Dirty Gertie yet.

30:13.813 --> 30:18.767
Pull her bow and she'll say hello.
I'm gonna go put on some music.

30:21.320 --> 30:26.533
She spit on me!

30:43.467 --> 30:45.669
Millie.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.965
Millie.

30:51.892 --> 30:55.144
Hi, Willie. This is my new
roommate, Pinky. This is Willie.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.223
We'll have a couple of beers.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.485
She and Edgar run this place.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.487
They live in that house out back.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.823
She's gonna have a baby.

31:09.618 --> 31:13.580
Don't pay any attention to her.
She never says much.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.999
Wait'll you meet Edgar.
He's really funny.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.044
He used to be on the Wyatt Earp
TV show. He knows Hugh O'Brian.

31:20.045 --> 31:25.758
<i>It's late in the evenin'</i>

31:25.759 --> 31:30.471
<i>'Bout drunk myself to death</i>

31:30.472 --> 31:32.557
<i>And I'm tired</i>

31:32.558 --> 31:35.768
- I like your paintings.
- Of hearin'

31:35.769 --> 31:38.229
<i>About your general lack</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:42.233
<i>Of happiness</i>

31:42.234 --> 31:47.155
Now, what'd ya say that for?
That's embarrassing.

31:47.156 --> 31:51.701
<i>Set 'em up again</i>

31:51.702 --> 31:56.205
<i>Another shot for me
A double shot for him</i>

31:56.206 --> 32:00.710
<i>Gonna drown all my troubles
in a case of gin</i>

32:00.711 --> 32:02.545
<i>I'm gonna drink</i>

32:02.546 --> 32:06.674
This one down

32:06.675 --> 32:10.929
<i>Then we'll have another round</i>

32:10.930 --> 32:15.808
<i>Gonna drink Ain't never gonna stop</i>

32:15.809 --> 32:20.222
<i>Gonna drink until I drop</i>

32:21.106 --> 32:24.059
You drink a lot of beer?

32:25.361 --> 32:28.397
Really.

32:31.575 --> 32:35.662
- Why'd you leave me
- Beer's 40 cents.

32:35.663 --> 32:40.409
- I usually leave a dime tip.
- Why did you have to go

32:41.251 --> 32:43.412
<i>Oh, I love...</i>

33:34.763 --> 33:38.091
Edgar, this is my new roommate,
Pinky. Pinky, this is Edgar Hart.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.356
Hold it!

33:45.357 --> 33:47.726
Never trust a dishonest
man, my dear.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.987
He was Hugh O'Brian's stand-in
on Wyatt Earp.

33:50.988 --> 33:54.991
Stunt double. I did all
of Hugh's stunts for him.

33:54.992 --> 33:59.746
- What'd you say your name was? Pinky?
- Yeah. That's my nickname.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.165
My real name's Mildred,
but I hate it.

34:02.166 --> 34:07.253
Well, you, uh... You kind
of look like a Pinky to me.

34:07.254 --> 34:11.083
Freeze! Rattlesnake.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.358
You'll be safe now, ladies.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.612
I thought that was a real rock.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.732
No. Edgar's always playin'
jokes on me like that.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.049
How come you didn't tell
me your name was Mildred?

34:49.074 --> 34:50.813
'Cause I hate it.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.885
- Well, what do you think my name is?
- Millie.

34:55.886 --> 34:59.381
- Ohh.
- Oh, yeah.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.857
<i>Ain't never gonna stop</i>

35:09.858 --> 35:14.403
<i>I'm gonna drink until I drop</i>

35:14.404 --> 35:19.117
- Jesus Christ. Beautiful.
- <i>I'm gonna drink until I drop</i>

35:19.118 --> 35:22.537
<i>I'm gonna drink</i>

35:22.538 --> 35:25.331
<i>Until</i>

35:25.332 --> 35:30.746
<i>I drop</i>

35:35.217 --> 35:37.419
<i>Yeah</i>

35:51.567 --> 35:55.645
Sure does remind me of Texas.
Doesn't it you?

35:57.156 --> 36:01.022
I don't like Texas anymore.
But I like it here.

36:01.048 --> 36:02.577
Me, too.

36:02.578 --> 36:06.831
- Your folks still live in Texas?
- I don't have any folks.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.451
Couple of aunts and uncles is all.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.580
My mother was sick.
Couldn't keep me.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.645
"Purple Sage Apartments."

36:29.646 --> 36:32.974
This is my parkin' space.
It's the best one.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.688
Get your stuff out.

36:39.781 --> 36:42.700
You sure don't have
very many things.

36:42.701 --> 36:46.988
I left most of my stuff with the
family I've been livin' with.

36:49.291 --> 36:52.835
It was old stuff anyway. Oh.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.837
This is our mailbox.

36:54.838 --> 36:59.501
You should get yourself a little tag and
put it on here so you can get your mail.

37:01.011 --> 37:04.472
Uck. Ugly underwear.

37:04.473 --> 37:08.343
Oh, good. Neiman Marcus.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.596
Another contest.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.392
Baby stuff. I don't need that.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.216
Millie.

37:49.851 --> 37:53.722
Oh, yeah. Willie did that a long time ago.
She and Edgar own this place.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.445
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:01.446 --> 38:05.074
Oh, hi, Tom. How's your cold?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.976
Oh, Millie.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.780
Ohh.

38:44.781 --> 38:47.734
Ya like it?

38:49.578 --> 38:54.248
I love it. It's so beautiful.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.993
Look at that big kitchen.

38:58.128 --> 39:02.923
I don't believe it.
This little stove. Oh.

39:06.511 --> 39:12.425
It's perfect.

39:18.607 --> 39:21.518
I decorated most of it myself.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.625
- Who was that guy out there?
- I told ya about Edgar.

39:37.626 --> 39:40.086
No, no. That cute guy.

39:40.087 --> 39:43.464
- Oh, you mean Tom.
- Yeah.

39:43.465 --> 39:46.706
Is... Is he your boyfriend?
He is, isn't he?

39:46.732 --> 39:50.638
He'd like to be. He's always
askin' me out and everything...

39:50.639 --> 39:54.175
but I'm not gonna go out with him
until he gets over that cold.

40:08.532 --> 40:11.776
- Wanna go see the bedroom?
- Yeah.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.208
This is our bedroom.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.469
Oh, it's so beautiful.

40:21.495 --> 40:24.981
And this is my closet.
And that's your closet.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.758
Oh, it's so big.

40:27.759 --> 40:32.596
- And this is our desk.
- Mmm.

40:32.597 --> 40:36.051
And that's my bed,
and that's your bed.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.889
This is my bed. Oh, Millie.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.691
I love it.

40:43.692 --> 40:47.020
I couldn't have imagined it
being more perfect.

40:47.863 --> 40:50.065
Thanks.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.820
- You know what?
- What?

40:57.038 --> 41:00.533
You're the most perfect
person I ever met.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.371
Thanks.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.558
I don't know if
I'm ever gonna have a kid.

41:17.559 --> 41:20.811
Just depends on the guy, I think.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.814
It's gonna have to be someone I
really wanna have 'em by, though.

41:23.815 --> 41:28.777
Like when I was born,
it was just an accident.

41:28.778 --> 41:34.275
Mother and Dad were married and everything,
but... they weren't ready to have a kid.

41:36.578 --> 41:40.164
I don't blame 'em.
It wasn't their fault.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.325
Things were different then.

41:43.877 --> 41:46.121
It's a lot easier
to make a mistake.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.091
And then where are you?
Nowhere, that's where.

41:51.092 --> 41:54.094
I plan everything I do.

41:54.095 --> 41:58.299
I figure out what it is I want,
and then I set out to do it.

41:59.976 --> 42:04.063
Like this apartment. I've been
decoratin' it ever since I moved in.

42:04.064 --> 42:09.151
And even if I fell in love with a guy
and wanted to get married...

42:09.152 --> 42:11.403
I wouldn't move into his place.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.906
He'd have to move in with me.

42:13.907 --> 42:17.201
And even then I'd wanna know
everything there is to know about him.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.446
Includin' money and health.

42:38.682 --> 42:41.183
Bathroom's empty now.
You can have it.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.143
Okay.

42:43.144 --> 42:46.564
- What's that you're wearin'?
- My coat.

42:46.565 --> 42:49.400
- Don't you have a bathrobe?
- Not yet.

42:49.401 --> 42:51.728
- Can you sew?
- Mm-hmm.

42:53.154 --> 42:56.657
- Okay, you can have this if you can fix it.
- Thanks, Millie.

42:56.658 --> 42:59.402
Yeah.

43:00.370 --> 43:03.330
I'm makin' us
some tuna melts for dinner.

43:03.331 --> 43:06.875
They're real easy and they only
take about 15 minutes to make.

43:06.876 --> 43:11.748
I'll tell ya how so you can make 'em yourself
in case I'm out on a date or somethin'.

43:12.632 --> 43:17.678
First you open all the cans and jars so
you'll have 'em ready when you go to mix 'em.

43:17.679 --> 43:21.549
Then you drain a can of tuna, and
you dump it into a big mixin' bowl.

43:22.517 --> 43:24.852
Now ya add a tablespoon full
of mayonnaise...

43:24.853 --> 43:28.765
and some salt and pepper, and ya
taste it to make sure it's okay.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.611
It's okay.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.897
Pretty.

43:37.907 --> 43:40.826
Next ya dice up, not chop up,
some onions and some celery...

43:40.827 --> 43:43.037
and ya mix 'em in
real even so that...

43:43.038 --> 43:46.498
you don't get a big bite of onion
or somethin' when you're eatin' it.

43:46.499 --> 43:48.792
If you don't have
any onions or any celery...

43:48.793 --> 43:52.880
you can just use some dehydrated
onions or some celery salt.

43:52.881 --> 43:56.584
That's what I'm doin'.
We didn't have any onions.

44:03.558 --> 44:06.268
- How'd ya like it?
- Mmm. It's great.

44:06.269 --> 44:10.974
- It's a lot better with real onions on it.
- I can't tell the difference.

44:14.486 --> 44:17.363
- You know what I like best about it, though?
- What?

44:17.364 --> 44:19.490
- You didn't put any tomatoes in it.
- Tomatoes?

44:19.491 --> 44:22.951
I hate tomatoes. Even when I have
spaghetti I don't put tomato sauce on it.

44:22.952 --> 44:25.663
- I just use that other white stuff.
- You don't like tomatoes?

44:25.664 --> 44:29.291
Me either.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.611
They call 'em love apples,
but I don't love 'em.

44:31.637 --> 44:33.246
I don't either.

44:34.464 --> 44:37.925
- You take the pill?
- Pi... The pill.

44:37.926 --> 44:40.386
- Well, sometimes.
- Me, too.

44:40.387 --> 44:42.346
But you can get
a bad reaction from it...

44:42.347 --> 44:45.550
so I just take it whenever I
know I'm gonna do somethin'.

44:46.685 --> 44:49.478
- You know what that is?
- That?

44:49.479 --> 44:51.480
- Yep.
- A shelf.

44:51.481 --> 44:53.482
- Nope.
- I give up.

44:53.483 --> 44:56.485
- It's a rollaway bed.
- What for?

44:56.486 --> 44:59.113
- For whenever we have company.
- Ohh.

44:59.114 --> 45:02.400
I slept on it a lot before my
roommate, Deidre, moved out.

45:18.842 --> 45:23.171
I fill in my diary every night, whether
anything happened that day or not.

45:25.014 --> 45:28.217
Got a lot
to write about today. You.

45:30.729 --> 45:32.813
I have a new roommate.

45:32.814 --> 45:35.607
Of all people, it's Pinky,
the new girl at work.

45:35.608 --> 45:38.318
She's a strange person, but it's
better than waitin' around...

45:38.319 --> 45:41.363
for some fat nurse
to answer the notice.

45:41.364 --> 45:44.783
On the way home I took her
to Dodge City for a beer.

45:44.784 --> 45:48.996
All the guys were ridin' dirt bikes
out back, so we didn't stay long.

45:48.997 --> 45:53.542
Edgar pulled one of his tricks on Pinky.
She fell for it till the end.

45:53.543 --> 45:57.087
She sure doesn't have much to her name,
but she does have a sewing machine...

45:57.088 --> 45:59.173
and maybe will make me
a new dress or somethin'.

45:59.174 --> 46:04.762
She loves the apartment. I guess she's
never lived in a decorated place before.

46:04.763 --> 46:06.923
Anyway, we're all settled in.

46:13.313 --> 46:16.432
Last one in bed
turns out the lights.

46:35.668 --> 46:38.079
Good night, Millie.

47:41.150 --> 47:44.862
I hope ya don't mind ridin' the bus
home tonight. I got a hot date.

47:44.863 --> 47:47.447
- I don't mind.
- Normally, I won't go out with a guy...

47:47.448 --> 47:50.492
unless he provides for the transportation,
but tonight I'm makin' an exception.

47:50.493 --> 47:55.205
Jeffo's car is in the shop. Besides,
he's worth makin' an exception for.

47:55.206 --> 47:58.000
He's real cute. Oh, yeah,
and don't wait up for me.

47:58.001 --> 48:01.086
- I'll probably be home real late.
- Okay.

48:01.087 --> 48:03.247
Bye.

48:04.799 --> 48:08.002
- Have a good time.
- I will.

48:55.725 --> 49:00.520
<i>You think you're winning
but you don't know the score</i>

49:00.521 --> 49:01.835
Hi. What ya drinkin'?

49:01.861 --> 49:05.025
Uh, it's liquor. It's,
uh, for somebody else.

49:05.026 --> 49:08.987
Six and two. One, two,
three, four, five, six...

49:08.988 --> 49:11.698
- <i>I'll keep on walkin'</i>
- Who's winnin'?

49:11.699 --> 49:13.700
<i>Till I'm over you</i>

49:13.701 --> 49:15.702
Two.

49:15.703 --> 49:18.372
- Hi, Pat.
- Millie, you're back.

49:18.373 --> 49:20.999
I hadn't been anywhere.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.670
If Pinky doesn't have a date, maybe
we'll come down and join ya later.

49:24.671 --> 49:28.215
Leave the past behind

49:28.216 --> 49:33.588
- You'd be the last thing on my mind
- Your turn.

49:45.608 --> 49:49.152
How come ya left these lyin' in the
middle of the living room floor?

49:49.153 --> 49:53.858
- Oh, hi, Millie. Oh, my shoes.
- Yeah.

49:54.867 --> 49:57.202
What's that you're wearin'?

49:57.203 --> 50:02.124
Oh, I-I spilled somethin' on that one
you gave me and I had to borrow yours.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.959
Well, I wish you'd ask
me first next time.

50:03.985 --> 50:06.189
- Okay.
- Okay.

50:13.553 --> 50:16.096
- What's this?
- Milk.

50:16.097 --> 50:19.224
I know it's milk, but what's
it doin' in the bathroom?

50:19.225 --> 50:21.510
What happened to your date?

50:24.188 --> 50:27.642
He wanted to go to some striptease
joint and I wasn't about to.

50:29.152 --> 50:32.320
Say, Tom and some of the guys are
settin' up a swimmin' party downstairs.

50:32.321 --> 50:34.823
Why don't we get on our
suits and go join 'em?

50:34.824 --> 50:37.826
- I don't have a suit.
- You can borrow one of mine.

50:37.827 --> 50:43.874
Tsk. Well, I got this sewin'
I wanna finish up and...

50:43.875 --> 50:47.377
Besides I... I got some
readin' I wanna catch up on.

50:58.139 --> 51:02.059
Uh-oh. Don't look now but it's
Thoroughly Modern Millie.

51:02.060 --> 51:05.645
Top of the stairs
making her entrance.

51:10.651 --> 51:13.070
Uh-oh. You better
start sneezing, man.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.449
Hi, Tom.

51:17.450 --> 51:20.160
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi, Tom.

51:20.161 --> 51:24.164
Close to me

51:24.165 --> 51:26.500
- Get some...
- I watch you sleep

51:26.501 --> 51:30.045
You're the guy who took her out.
I don't know what you're laughing about.

51:30.046 --> 51:32.672
"Sexual drive.

51:32.673 --> 51:36.718
"We went to my apartment,
went straight to bed.

51:36.719 --> 51:42.216
- Your arms around me
- It was great."

51:45.186 --> 51:50.065
- Oh, how I love
- Would anyone care to go for a swim?

51:50.066 --> 51:53.193
- No. Mm-mmm. Just ate.
- When you hold me

51:53.194 --> 51:57.739
Well, I guess you shouldn't swim for
at least an hour after you've eaten.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.783
Oh...

51:59.784 --> 52:01.743
- No.
- This one?

52:01.744 --> 52:03.745
Mm-mmm.

52:03.746 --> 52:07.207
- This one?
- Mm-mmm. No.

52:07.208 --> 52:09.251
Checking out early, Lammoreaux?

52:09.252 --> 52:12.629
- No, I came in early.
- Oh. All right.

52:12.630 --> 52:15.382
- What about this?
- No.

52:15.383 --> 52:18.093
Okay, a couple of
these are signed...

52:18.094 --> 52:19.526
Hurry up. It's Friday.

52:19.552 --> 52:21.555
- I wanna get out of here.
- Okay.

52:21.556 --> 52:24.391
- What's Friday?
- That's a five.

52:24.392 --> 52:26.893
You can read it. I can't read it.

52:26.894 --> 52:29.855
Well, it's very easy.

52:29.856 --> 52:32.691
- Oh!
- The twins did that.

52:32.692 --> 52:35.735
- What's this?
- I punched Millie's card by mistake.

52:35.736 --> 52:39.315
I can't... This is all blurry.
Vivian? Vivian?

52:40.241 --> 52:42.450
Rose here has punched
Lammoreaux's card...

52:42.451 --> 52:45.400
and the time out is double-punched,
like it's blurry. I can't read it.

52:45.426 --> 52:46.580
It was a mistake.

52:46.581 --> 52:49.382
- I'll take care of this. Where's Millie?
- She's getting dressed.

52:49.408 --> 52:51.595
Get her and come into my office.
Don't you get dressed.

52:51.621 --> 52:54.564
- I wanna take care of this right now.
- Yes, ma'am.

53:02.847 --> 53:04.848
That's the dumbest thing
you ever did.

53:04.849 --> 53:07.475
She just loves makin' me late
gettin' out of here on Friday.

53:07.476 --> 53:09.978
- I'm sorry, Millie.
- Well, hurry up and get dressed.

53:09.979 --> 53:13.481
If you're not outta there in five minutes,
I'm gonna have to leave without ya.

53:13.482 --> 53:16.401
It won't take me that long.

53:16.402 --> 53:18.562
Whoo!

53:27.413 --> 53:30.457
I wonder what it's like
to be twins.

53:30.458 --> 53:34.829
- Huh?
- Twins. Bet it'd be weird.

53:37.131 --> 53:40.334
Do you think they know
which one they are?

53:41.969 --> 53:44.638
Sure they do.
They'd have to, wouldn't they?

53:44.639 --> 53:47.007
I don't know.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.136
Maybe they switch back and forth.

53:51.062 --> 53:54.856
You know, one day... Peggy's Polly.

53:54.857 --> 53:57.525
Another day, Polly's Peggy.

53:57.926 --> 53:59.587
Who knows?

54:00.571 --> 54:03.065
Maybe they're the same one
all the time.

54:05.284 --> 54:07.981
Can we just talk about
somethin' else now?

54:08.007 --> 54:09.355
Yeah.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.533
What?

54:34.689 --> 54:37.099
Not that way, Pinky. This way.

56:06.197 --> 56:09.400
Pinky? Pinky! Come on.

56:23.964 --> 56:27.801
Hi, guys. This is
Pinky, my new roommate.

56:27.802 --> 56:31.137
This is Jimmy, Rich,
Joe, Johnny and Roger.

56:31.138 --> 56:32.680
- Hi, Pinky.
- Pinky.

56:32.681 --> 56:35.683
- I thought you weren't comin'.
- I'm just a little late. Hi, Jim.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.685
- Hi, Millie.
- You remember Pinky?

56:37.686 --> 56:39.813
Pinky, look out!
Oh, boy. Very close.

56:39.814 --> 56:42.690
- Let's shoot.
- You remember this now?

56:43.409 --> 56:46.152
What's the matter, Pinky?
Don't ya like guns?

56:46.153 --> 56:49.656
- There you go. That's good.
- Seemed awful tight.

56:49.657 --> 56:52.325
- All right. Let me get a good aim on it.
- Ready to go.

56:52.326 --> 56:53.712
Right in the...

56:53.738 --> 56:55.146
Good.

57:17.935 --> 57:23.773
- The neck.
- The neck? You killer.

57:23.774 --> 57:28.604
I'd rather face a thousand crazy savages
than one woman who's learned how to shoot.

57:44.628 --> 57:47.665
No, I've been up for hours.

57:49.216 --> 57:52.503
Well, I kind of got a tentative
date for tonight. Why?

57:53.596 --> 57:57.849
Really? Well, it's nothin'
I can't get out of.

57:57.850 --> 58:02.562
I've stood this guy up so many times before
and he just keeps comin' back for more.

58:02.563 --> 58:05.683
Two extra guys, huh? Are they cute?

58:07.401 --> 58:12.113
Oh, yeah. She's all right. She's
kind of quiet, but she's real nice.

58:12.114 --> 58:16.068
Kind of homey.
No, not homely, homey.

58:16.911 --> 58:21.281
Okay, see ya tonight. Bye.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.916
Pinky, wake up.

58:32.510 --> 58:33.615
What time is it?

58:33.641 --> 58:36.638
Early. I hope you don't
have any plans for tonight.

58:36.639 --> 58:38.681
I don't. Why?

58:38.707 --> 58:41.059
Well, you remember my
ex-roommate, Deidre?

58:41.060 --> 58:41.944
Uh-huh.

58:41.970 --> 58:45.480
Well, she, her boyfriend and two other
guys are comin' over for dinner tonight.

58:45.481 --> 58:49.601
- Here?
- Sure. I'm famous for my dinner parties.

58:51.237 --> 58:55.281
Tell ya what. I'll go and do the shoppin',
if you'll clean up the apartment, okay?

58:55.282 --> 58:58.368
Okay.

58:58.369 --> 59:01.989
Cigarette lighter. Beautiful.

59:03.374 --> 59:07.745
Gum wrapper. Jesus Christ.

59:08.754 --> 59:11.707
Pigs.

59:20.057 --> 59:23.677
Hi, Tom.

59:29.483 --> 59:31.568
- Hi, Edgar.
- Hi.

59:31.569 --> 59:34.028
I'm givin' another one of my
special dinner parties tonight.

59:34.029 --> 59:34.771
Oh, yeah?

59:34.797 --> 59:37.740
Yeah. Deidre, Jim and a couple
of other guys are comin' over.

59:37.741 --> 59:38.483
Uh-huh.

59:38.509 --> 59:41.452
We're havin' pigs in a blanket
and chocolate puddin' tarts.

59:41.453 --> 59:43.580
Just keep it out of the pool.
It'll be all right.

59:43.581 --> 59:45.331
- See ya later.
- Yeah.

59:45.332 --> 59:49.460
Pinky? Pinky, would you
get the door for me?

59:49.461 --> 59:51.796
My hands are full.

59:51.797 --> 59:55.341
- Pinky?
- Oh, hi.

59:55.342 --> 59:58.704
Hi. I just got through.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.349
- Looks great.
- What'd ya get?

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.351
All kinds of good stuff.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:08.730
- Did you get me any gum?
- Yep.

01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:11.225
It's probably on the
bottom, though.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:14.694
Got wieners for pigs in a blanket.

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:18.239
- Oh, great.
- Pringles.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.491
Now, these are to fill up
those patty shells.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:22.493
Oh, they don't have stuff in 'em?

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.330
- Nope. They come empty.
- Wine! You got wine!

01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:27.498
- Yeah.
- Tickled Pink?

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:31.044
- And Lemon Satin.
- Lemon Satin.

01:00:31.045 --> 01:00:33.580
And we got all kinds
of stuff for dips.

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:40.678
- Oh, gosh.
- They're Florentine wine goblets.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.798
Thanks.

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:46.743
Mmm. Smells good.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:48.252
What are these for?

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.146
They're to sprinkle on top
of the chocolate puddin'.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.432
- Great.
- It's already cooked.

01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:06.954
What do I do now?

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.248
You can start by takin'
some of that cheese spread...

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:12.001
and squirtin' it all in a circle
on top of those Sociables.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.545
And then put an olive
on top of each one.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:17.924
Okay? Oh, don't eat the whole ones!

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:20.051
- Just eat the broken ones.
- Oh. Oh.

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:22.254
That's for the guests.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:30.436
- That our dessert?
- Yeah.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.939
These our hors d'oeuvres?

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.935
I made these once before,
and they were a real big hit.

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.963
Millie.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:13.563
- What are you doin'?
- I spilled one.

01:02:13.564 --> 01:02:15.940
- Oh, Pinky.
- We can fill it up with ketchup.

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:18.151
No, we can't. It won't taste right.

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.945
- I only had six of 'em.
- I won't eat one.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:23.156
Then the table won't be even.

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:26.117
Now I've got to go to the grocery
store and get another one.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:28.327
While I'm gone I want you to
clean up this mess you made...

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.830
and put the clean sheets
on the rollaway bed.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:33.492
This really cuts down
on my time to get ready.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:23.375
In and out, in and out. I promise,
boys. I won't take long.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.720
Go, go, go.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:31.015
Hey, Red! You live here?

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:34.185
- Yeah.
- You know, uh, Millie Lammoreaux?

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:37.104
- Millie Lammoreaux, yeah...
- Yeah, listen. You give her a message, okay?

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:40.650
I'm Deidre. We were supposed to come by
maybe for a drink or somethin', but...

01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:42.735
Cut that out, will ya?

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.738
We were, uh... These guys
are real hot to trot...

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.825
so we're just gonna go on out to Dodge
City and shoot some tires or somethin'.

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:51.160
- You tell her maybe we'll see her later.
- Let's go.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.871
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot, sweetheart.

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.873
- Let's hit the road.
- Good job.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:12.265
How do you like it?
It's a Mr. Lamar from Dallas.

01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:15.393
- Isn't it cute?
- They can't come, Millie.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:18.938
- Who?
- Deidre and those guys.

01:04:18.939 --> 01:04:21.023
What do you mean, they can't come?

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:25.528
Well, I just saw 'em downstairs
when I took the trash down, and...

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:30.283
they said to tell you they had to go to Dodge
City and they'd see you some other time.

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:32.326
Well, what about dinner?

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.496
- They didn't say.
- What do you mean they didn't say?

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:37.790
- What did you say to 'em?
- Nothin'.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.502
- I didn't say anything.
- Well, look at you.

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:44.380
I told you to get
yourself fixed up.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.625
You probably scared 'em away.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:53.848
- Millie.
- Just shut up. You ruined everything.

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:56.809
- You always do.
- We could invite somebody else.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.729
- Who?
- Well...

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:04.358
maybe Tom would come,
some of those guys from here.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:06.520
Millie?

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:10.281
Millie.

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:13.326
We could eat it ourselves.

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:15.779
We could just have our own party.

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:22.126
Where you goin'?

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:25.413
I'm gonna go find 'em
and have some fun for a change.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.581
Come on, Pinky. Wake up.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:45.418
Huh?

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:48.212
You gotta sleep
on the rollaway bed tonight.

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:52.876
- I got company.
- Oh, okay.

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:01.635
Did you have fun?

01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:16.657
She's out. We can go in now.

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:21.120
Pinky, baby. Now, did we throw you
out of your little beddy-ni...

01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:23.247
beddy-bye tonight, sweetheart?

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:29.086
I think we ought to have Pinky
join us... in the fun, huh?

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.797
- I mean, two... But three.
- Come on, Edgar.

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:34.376
Millie?

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.971
Not one word.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:41.724
What do you know about anything?

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.435
Don't. What about Willie?

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:47.021
- I know all about Willie.
- You don't. She's gonna have a baby.

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:51.275
Why don't you mind your own business for a
change? This has nothing to do with you.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.670
Ever since you moved in here
you've been causing me grief.

01:07:53.696 --> 01:07:55.321
Nobody wants to hang around you.

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:58.407
You don't drink. You don't smoke. You
don't do anything you're supposed to do.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.428
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:07:59.454 --> 01:08:03.846
If you don't like the way I intend to live
around here why don't you just move out!

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:07.259
Any time suits me! Any time at all!

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:17.288
Tom!

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:21.000
Tom!

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:24.087
Tom!

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.559
Laurie, call an ambulance!
Call a doctor!

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.561
- Is she dead?
- I don't know.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:35.231
Watch her head. Watch her head.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:38.317
Take her other arm, her other arm.

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:40.736
Hurry now.
Get a blanket and a pillow.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:44.198
- Are you supposed to turn her over?
- I called an ambulance.

01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:47.610
- Turn her face over.
- No, no. She's okay.

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:50.663
Watch her head, too. Look at that.

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:52.665
- Oh, my God. She's lucky.
- Is she breathing?

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:56.870
No, she's okay. She's...

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:07.213
She's breathing.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:11.350
- She's over here.
- Can you tell us what happened?

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:13.936
Uh, I guess she fell off
the top here. That's all I know.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:16.931
- Do you know how long she was in the water?
- I don't know...

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:21.402
- Why'd she do this?
- I don't know.

01:11:21.403 --> 01:11:24.029
- Who pulled her out? You?
- Yeah, we pulled her out.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.032
Did you hear when she hit
the water or anything like that?

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:30.077
- No.
- Yeah. She lives upstairs.

01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:33.414
- That's her roommate.
- Did you see what happened?

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:37.001
- No.
- Can you help me for a second?

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:39.003
- Yes.
- How long have you lived with her?

01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:41.038
I want to take this pillow
out from under her head.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:41.922
Okay.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.924
- Not long.
- Not long.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.659
Do you know if she may
have fallen or jumped?

01:11:45.685 --> 01:11:46.218
No.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:49.596
- B.P.'s 80 over 50.
- How old is she?

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:53.183
- I never asked her.
- You never asked her?

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:56.145
- No. She's unconscious.
- Okay.

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.098
Okay, do you know if she takes any
kind of medicines or medications?

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.894
No.

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:08.691
Cervical collar, put it on her.
Excuse me, please.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:14.913
Okay, we need a couple of guys
on the sides to steady her...

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.458
as we put her on the gurney.

01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:20.119
It really doesn't look good.

01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:24.255
Are you gonna lift?

01:12:24.281 --> 01:12:27.092
You guys just steady it
when he gets on the end.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:30.387
- Then, we'll...
- Okay.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:33.307
Dr. Faulkner, 6221.

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:37.262
Dr. Faulkner, 6221.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:47.196
- What time they bring her in?
- About 2:30 this morning.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:52.368
- Vital sign changes?
- No changes. Her level's about six.

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:55.162
- Was that sutured up in E.R.?
- Yes, it was.

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:58.624
Oh, boy. Never happens
in the daytime, does it?

01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:00.868
- Where's the chart?
- Down at the desk.

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:07.174
- Nona, give me the chart.
- 122?

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:11.845
- I don't know.
- Joan, do you have 122?

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:15.349
- Got a pen?
- Jim Van Duzer...

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:18.060
6464.

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:21.472
Jim Van Duzer, 6464.

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:47.172
- He took my pen again.
- You're lucky that's all he took.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:50.843
- You the roommate?
- Yes. Is she gonna be all right?

01:13:50.844 --> 01:13:55.514
Well, she's unconscious, but...
She's in a coma, actually.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:57.766
There's no skull fracture,
so that's good.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:01.520
- All we can do now is wait and see.
- Well, when will you know?

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.404
What about her family?
Where are they?

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:04.874
I don't know. Texas?

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.194
- You mean there's no one here?
- Only me.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.864
Well, I suggest you try to
locate some relative...

01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:14.074
because this girl's in
pretty serious condition.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.619
Hey, you got a little piece
of tobacco right there.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.429
Okay.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:21.665
You look kind of tired
yourself. You okay?

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:26.253
- Yeah.
- How about some coffee?

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:30.257
- What about Pinky?
- She'll be fine.

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:33.086
- Come on. I'll buy you breakfast.
- No.

01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:52.522
Pinky?

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:09.713
Don't die.

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:13.342
I'm sorry. I don't have a
listing under that name.

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:19.306
But I've got to get hold of 'em. Their
daughter's been in an accident.

01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:21.892
- What'll I do?
- Do you have an address?

01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:24.770
Just this P.O. box
in Quitman, Texas.

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:27.789
Probably the best thing
is send them a telegram.

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:28.774
A telegram?

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:32.986
That'd be the fastest. I'm sorry.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:36.899
But I didn't... I don't even
know how to send a telegram.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:46.625
Shit.

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:50.663
His breathing is really getting
worse, and his color is...

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:54.508
- Hi, Connie.
- Hi, Millie.

01:15:54.509 --> 01:15:57.302
- Has there been any change?
- No. Doctor was just in with her.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:58.749
Can I see her for a minute?

01:15:58.775 --> 01:16:01.640
- I've got some things for her.
- Sure. Five minutes max.

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.843
Okay, thanks.

01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:13.644
Hi, Pinky. You look real good
today. A lot better.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:17.148
Your mom and dad are gonna
come out any day now.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:21.451
Everybody really misses ya,
especially the twins.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:23.912
I brought ya a whole
bunch of presents.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:27.457
First, I got you this sewin'
lesson I cut out of McCall's.

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:31.086
And an ad for a computerized sewing
machine that practically sews for you.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:35.549
A faint systole at 86. No
diastole I can pick up.

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:38.336
And I brought you this
beautiful new pink bed jacket.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.094
Alcira, you want to
sign this card to Pinky?

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.061
Pinky?

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:52.099
- Pinky Rose.
- Pinky Rose.

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.436
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.026
Peggy? You want to sign
this card to Pinky?

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:05.446
Everybody else did.

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:10.334
- Lammoreaux.
- You want to sign this card to Pinky?

01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:13.587
You have a personal call on the
office phone... Long distance.

01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:16.340
- Oh, that must be her folks.
- Collect, Lammoreaux.

01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:19.426
- You know that's not allowed.
- But this is really important, Miss Bunweill.

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:22.346
You know our policy on phone
calls, personal or otherwise.

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.849
And this one happens to be collect,
and how do you intend to pay for it?

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.594
Well, you can take it
out of my paycheck.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.102
How long ago did the
bus from Texas arrive?

01:18:10.103 --> 01:18:12.854
- An hour ago.
- But somebody called me to pick 'em up...

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.856
and I don't see 'em.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:17.484
There's a pay phone over there.

01:18:17.485 --> 01:18:20.028
It was a Mrs. Rose.
She's my roommate's mother.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:23.031
- Are you Millie?
- Yes.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:27.828
I'm Pinky's mother,
and this is my husband, Y.R.

01:18:27.829 --> 01:18:30.156
- Y.R.?
- Huh?

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:35.661
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:39.582
Well, Pinky's waitin' on us.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:55.063
So she just fell off the railin'
and landed on her head?

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.817
- Yes, ma'am.
- That'd be Pinky, all right.

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:01.695
She was always the fallin' one.

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:04.865
One time she was jumpin'
up and down on the bed...

01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:09.995
and she fell off and hit her head on
the wall and had to have stitches.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.990
I know she'll wake up
when she sees you.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.704
Sure does look like Texas.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.518
- Hi, Connie.
- Hi.

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:35.604
- These are Pinky's parents.
- Hello.

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:37.807
That's Connie.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:42.736
The nurses here are all real nice.

01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:45.405
Wait a minute, please.
You can't go in there.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:47.449
This is an intensive care unit.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:51.244
These are Pinky's parents. They came
out all the way from Texas on a bus.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.372
Oh. And who are you?

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:57.834
Well, I'm her roommate.
I've been here every day.

01:19:57.835 --> 01:20:00.462
I thought maybe if they
talk to her, she'd wake up.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:04.549
Well, all right. But only
five minutes. You people.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.169
I don't know who she thinks she is.

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:12.466
Pinky? Your mom and dad are here.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.732
That's Pinky, all right.

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:23.276
Just look at her, Y.R.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:26.404
- She's purty as ever.
- What's wrong with her?

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:29.699
Shh. You'll wake her up.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.113
She's in a coma. All we can
do now is wait and see.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:38.291
Y.R. named her Pinky.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.377
Why doesn't she wake up?

01:20:40.378 --> 01:20:42.663
She's sick.

01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:48.176
- Where's the present?
- What?

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.178
Oh, never mind. I got it.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:54.633
It's for Pinky. Go
ahead and open it.

01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:00.639
Read it.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:06.152
"In this kitchen
bright and cheery...

01:21:06.153 --> 01:21:09.489
"daily chores I'll never shirk.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:13.652
So bless this kitchen, Lord,
and bless me as I work."

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.157
It's for the kitchen.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:27.833
What are we supposed to do now?

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:50.572
Everybody's well-done, right?

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:53.575
Yeah, well, good luck.

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:56.828
Rare? I know a hamburger stand...

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:59.331
I'm happy with it... burned.

01:22:06.756 --> 01:22:10.835
Hi. These are the Roses,
Pinky's parents.

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:16.514
She's still in a coma, but we think
she's gonna come out of it soon.

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:18.634
Hi, Tom.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.854
Oh, I'm sorry I can't have
dinner with you tonight.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.856
I want to cook for the Roses.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.276
Can't have dinner with us. That's
too bad. I was really expecting her.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.821
- Oh, you want to let me carry that for you?
- Thank you.

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:34.074
- Safety's the best precaution.
- Thank you.

01:22:34.075 --> 01:22:36.443
One hand on the rail.

01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:42.332
You can have my bedroom to sleep in.
I've got a rollaway in the living room.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:44.834
Sure. No problem. You want
super sauce on that one?

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.962
You can stay as long as you want.

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:50.298
A little barbecue sauce would be
nice. But don't scorch it, please.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.592
- You'll like it.
- These are all blood rare.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:54.886
Can you make it fast?
We've been waiting a half hour.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:57.089
You'll love 'em.

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:55.316
Mrs. Rose? We've got
some good news for you.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:58.361
Your, uh, daughter started to
respond after you left yesterday...

01:25:58.362 --> 01:26:00.780
and so we've moved her out
of the intensive care unit.

01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:04.534
Uh, she even took a little
orange juice for breakfast.

01:26:04.535 --> 01:26:09.664
You can see her now, but don't talk to her
too much or get her too excited, okay?

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.791
Yeah.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:14.169
- Mr. Rose.
- Huh? What?

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:16.629
Daughter's all right now.
She woke up.

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:18.791
Oh, good.

01:26:20.593 --> 01:26:23.553
- Well, can we go see her?
- Sure, she's right across the hall.

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:25.881
Come on, Y.R.

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:39.319
- Hi, Pinky.
- Hi.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.855
Look who's here.

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:48.070
- Who?
- Your parents.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:53.124
- What?
- It's your mom and dad.

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:55.327
They're not my parents.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:59.289
Well, sure they are.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.761
They're not my parents.

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:08.806
- I've never seen 'em before.
- Pinky, it's Mama.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.677
- Here's your daddy.
- See?

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:18.441
- I don't know you.
- Wha-What's the matter with her?

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:21.145
Well, what is the matter
with you, Pinky?

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.365
What are you tryin' to do to me?

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:27.825
Nothin'. They came all the way
out from Texas to see you.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:30.245
Don't ya even appreciate it?

01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:34.374
I don't care where they came from.
They're not my parents.

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:36.793
- They're not my parents.
- But, Pinky...

01:27:36.794 --> 01:27:40.713
- Don't call me Pinky!
- Now you must go outside.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:44.384
Get out of here! Get out!
Just get out!

01:27:44.385 --> 01:27:47.345
- Get out of here! You're not my parents.
- You just relax.

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:49.847
- They came in here...
- It's all right. You had a concussion.

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.517
No, it's all right. They're going
outside. It's okay. It's all right.

01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:56.354
She said they were my parents, and I
never seen 'em before in my life.

01:27:56.355 --> 01:28:00.400
I'm going to tell you exactly
what the doctor told her parents.

01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:03.695
She's obviously suffering
from temporary amnesia.

01:28:03.696 --> 01:28:05.989
It's not uncommon
in cases like this.

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.991
- Since the...
- Okay, she's asleep.

01:28:07.992 --> 01:28:10.994
Since the presence of her
parents agitates her...

01:28:10.995 --> 01:28:13.079
we suggest she doesn't
see them for awhile.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.916
She seems to recognize you and
feel comfortable around you...

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:20.211
so we think, in a few days, she
should be going home with you.

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:23.749
And her recovery
should be fairly rapid.

01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:35.393
I think she'll be back
at work in a week.

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:38.438
The doctors really thought
that she was gonna die.

01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:42.392
But what's worse, there could
have been brain damage.

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:49.073
She asks about each and every one
of you, especially the twins.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:52.744
I'm sure if you want to come
by and see her, she'd like it.

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:56.873
We're gonna eat in here today. You're
probably going to the hospital, huh?

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:59.243
See you later.

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:12.214
Hope you don't get
that polish on the bedspread.

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:15.391
How'd you like your burger melts?

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:19.012
- Is there any more milk?
- Yeah. I'll get you some.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.067
Everybody sure missed you at work.

01:29:24.068 --> 01:29:28.480
Even the twins, and they usually don't
care about anybody but themselves.

01:29:29.948 --> 01:29:33.235
- How you feelin'?
- Okay.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:40.492
Wanna watch TV?

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:45.372
I can bring the set
in here for you.

01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:54.047
God, I hope I'm not pregnant.

01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:05.642
Oh, it's sour.

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:12.615
- How could you be pregnant?
- Dr. Norton.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:15.159
How do you think?

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.495
He was in my room all the time.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:20.282
Every time I woke
up he was in there.

01:30:23.794 --> 01:30:26.921
Did you... do anything with him?

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:31.043
How am I supposed to know?
I was drugged all the time.

01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:36.222
Could've done anything he
wanted to. Probably did.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:38.391
Did he say anything?

01:30:38.392 --> 01:30:40.852
About what?

01:30:40.853 --> 01:30:44.556
To let you know if, uh,
he did anything or not.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:48.443
He said I ought
to have my own room.

01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:50.646
I'd probably get well faster.

01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:56.068
- In the hospital or here?
- Both.

01:30:58.203 --> 01:31:01.080
But I told him we just had
this little apartment and...

01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.166
it only had one bedroom...

01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:05.744
so it was out of the question.

01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:09.122
One more coat.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.383
Maybe you should have
your own bedroom.

01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:16.095
What are you gonna
do, move out on me?

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:19.765
No. I could sleep
on the rollaway bed.

01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:22.094
Did it all the time
when Deidre was here.

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:27.933
- You wouldn't mind?
- No.

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:32.729
- Are you sure?
- Sure. I'm sure.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:36.866
Okay.

01:31:36.867 --> 01:31:40.161
Whatever you want. I don't care.

01:31:54.343 --> 01:31:56.761
Don't you remember her,
Dr. Maas? Pinky Rose.

01:31:56.762 --> 01:31:59.764
She's all well now, and she
wants to come back to work.

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:02.266
Rose? I don't... Lammoreaux,
Bunweill's in charge of personnel.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:05.269
And if there's no place for her
here, there's no place for her.

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:07.939
But she's already worked here.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.691
She's really good, Dr. Maas.

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:13.194
Everybody liked her.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:15.163
Really.

01:32:21.912 --> 01:32:24.956
- Hello?
- Are you okay?

01:32:24.957 --> 01:32:28.334
- Who's this?
- It's me, Millie.

01:32:28.335 --> 01:32:30.912
Oh.

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:34.916
- What you doin'?
- Nothin'.

01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:40.012
Can I bring you home
something special for dinner?

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:42.257
No.

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:46.352
Are you alone?

01:32:46.353 --> 01:32:49.347
Sure. Why?

01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:52.400
I don't know.

01:32:52.401 --> 01:32:55.611
- I just thought I heard somebody.
- You did.

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:58.607
- It was me.
- Oh.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:04.579
- Okay. See you later.
- Bye.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.873
Edgar. I told you it was Millie.
You're not supposed to do that.

01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:10.167
- She might hear you.
- Millie.

01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:30.104
No. I do not think
this was a simple mistake.

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:32.523
The chances of her making up
a Social Security number...

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:35.026
exactly the same as yours
are very slim.

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:38.529
She maliciously gave me your number
when she filled out her W-4.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:40.531
How could she have?
I didn't even know her then.

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:42.617
Don't get smart with me.
You can't fool me.

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:44.660
She told me she couldn't
remember her number...

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:47.788
and was gonna write home for it,
and, like a fool, I believed her.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:50.249
So maybe she forgot to do it and
just gave you mine instead.

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:52.369
She didn't mean anything bad by it.

01:33:54.046 --> 01:33:57.340
I don't know what makes it such
a big deal. She's just a little kid.

01:33:57.341 --> 01:33:59.634
I'll tell you what makes
it such a big deal.

01:33:59.635 --> 01:34:02.053
I do not want any discrepancies
in these records.

01:34:02.054 --> 01:34:05.681
I do not want government people
here going through these books.

01:34:05.682 --> 01:34:07.850
I think Rose did this on purpose.

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:10.561
I didn't trust her from the very
minute I first laid eyes on her.

01:34:10.562 --> 01:34:12.647
She never did anything
wrong on purpose.

01:34:12.648 --> 01:34:14.649
She's just scared of you,
that's all.

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:18.361
Then she almost died, and
nobody even cared around here.

01:34:18.362 --> 01:34:20.821
You're the bad ones, not Pinky.

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.574
All you care about's
your time clock...

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:26.577
and your money and your dumb books.

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:29.041
Well, you don't have to worry about
any Social Security numbers anymore,

01:34:29.067 --> 01:34:30.532
because I quit.

01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:34.085
It's a horrible job.

01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:36.830
And we don't need it.
Neither of us.

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:04.566
Damn it!

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:08.153
I don't believe it.

01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:11.615
My car is gone.

01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:15.376
- My car has been stolen.
- Well, call the police.

01:35:15.377 --> 01:35:17.545
I'm going to.

01:35:17.546 --> 01:35:19.547
- "Lammerex"?
- Lammoreaux.

01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:21.674
L-A-M-M-O-R-E-A-U-X.

01:35:21.675 --> 01:35:23.759
- Uh, Millie.
- Lammoreaux, right.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.470
Millie Lammoreaux. You live over
at the Purple Sage Apartments?

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.639
Yeah. How do you know?

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.725
- Deidre Black's friend.
- You know Deidre Black?

01:35:30.726 --> 01:35:32.727
Sure I do. She's my ex-roommate.

01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:34.729
- We came by your house the other day.
- Yeah.

01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:36.731
We stopped by. We were gonna
have a drink or something...

01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:38.899
but we were in a hurry and
went over to Edgar's place.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.154
Okay, let's see. The color
of the car was, uh, mustard.

01:35:43.155 --> 01:35:45.573
- Just like your dress, huh?
- No, that's English mustard.

01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:49.076
My car was more
of a French mustard color.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:51.829
And, uh, no license
and no registration?

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.831
No, I told you. It's with the car.

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:57.710
Is it possible a friend could've gotten
the car without you knowin' about it?

01:35:57.711 --> 01:36:00.796
No. My roommate doesn't even
drive. Besides, she's sick.

01:36:00.797 --> 01:36:04.258
Is that your car, right there? Huh?

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:08.013
That's it, all right.
What's it doin' here?

01:36:09.014 --> 01:36:11.883
Really, I didn't know
anything about it.

01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:18.022
Dodge City's about the last
place I'd expect it to be.

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:21.317
I don't know who would've
brought it here, really.

01:36:21.318 --> 01:36:24.195
- It's crazy.
- You sure that's it?

01:36:24.196 --> 01:36:27.281
I'm sure that's it. That's my
license plate number right there.

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:30.318
And my decals.

01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:33.537
Look here. They even
left the key in here.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:36.908
Come on. Let's go inside
and see who's in there.

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:48.135
Boy, whoever it is
is gonna be sorry.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:55.142
- Hey, Jim.
- Deidre, what are you doing here?

01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:57.686
- Hi, Millie. Where have you been?
- My car's been stolen.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:59.212
That's where I've been.

01:36:59.238 --> 01:37:01.565
Your car's not been stolen.
It's sittin' right out front.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:04.276
- I saw the little redhead drive it up.
- What little redhead?

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:06.612
Little redhead shootin' out
on the range with Edgar.

01:37:06.613 --> 01:37:08.906
- It's been here awhile. A chick drove it.
- Where'd Edgar go?

01:37:08.907 --> 01:37:11.033
- He's out back shootin'.
- Yeah?

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:12.952
- Do some shootin' later on?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:37:12.953 --> 01:37:14.912
- That's Pinky.
- Who's Pinky?

01:37:14.913 --> 01:37:17.832
My roommate, damn it.

01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:20.876
Case is solved.

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:43.315
That's good.

01:37:43.316 --> 01:37:45.985
See, once you find your pattern,
then you can adjust to it.

01:37:45.986 --> 01:37:48.445
The main thing is to take
a nice slow squeeze...

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:50.447
not knowing when it's gonna go.

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:52.567
And take your time.

01:37:54.119 --> 01:37:56.745
That's fantastic.

01:37:56.746 --> 01:38:00.457
All right, Pinky. How come
you stole my car? Pinky?

01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:03.328
I didn't steal your car.

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:07.214
- I borrowed it.
- You did not.

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:09.425
- You didn't even ask.
- Couldn't find you.

01:38:09.426 --> 01:38:12.595
- You didn't try very hard.
- I tried hard.

01:38:12.596 --> 01:38:16.348
You did not. You could've at least
told Doris or Alcira or somebody.

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:18.646
Who took you there to
go in and get my keys?

01:38:18.672 --> 01:38:20.120
Tom.

01:38:21.438 --> 01:38:23.480
Pinky, I had to call the
police and everything.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:26.108
They're sittin' in there
right now waitin' on me.

01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:28.527
They think somebody stole my car.

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:30.654
They're sittin' in there, huh?

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:34.192
Well, aren't you the lucky one?

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.529
Give me a slug of that, huh?

01:39:04.314 --> 01:39:07.858
Very nice. All set.

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:11.028
I'm home.

01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:13.405
- Oh, hi.
- And two.

01:39:13.406 --> 01:39:15.449
Anybody want another drink?

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.451
- I do.
- Love one, Rich.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:18.469
Thanks.

01:39:18.495 --> 01:39:21.038
You're supposed to
be restin', Pinky.

01:39:21.039 --> 01:39:23.082
What do you think I'm doin'?

01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:26.585
- You can't do...
- I bought us a barbecued chicken...

01:39:26.586 --> 01:39:29.838
and I'm gonna make barbecued
chicken melts for dinner.

01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:31.391
I told you about 'em before.

01:39:31.417 --> 01:39:34.551
I'm gonna have hamburgers
down here with the guys.

01:39:34.552 --> 01:39:39.473
- You can't.
- What do you mean, I can't?

01:39:39.474 --> 01:39:42.351
You can't. I bought
all these groceries.

01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:45.646
Besides, you're not supposed
to be up for too long.

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:47.849
Pinky.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:51.485
These guys just happened
to have saved my life...

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:54.989
and I'll spend just as much time
with them as I like, thank you.

01:39:56.992 --> 01:39:58.993
- Patty melt chicken?
- Thank you.

01:39:58.994 --> 01:40:01.495
- You're welcome.
- Bet you hate that.

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:03.740
Champagne taste.

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:41.118
"At least I've got her
to move out of the bedroom.

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:43.996
"I wish I could remember
more about her.

01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:47.200
"But I do know she isn't
much fun to be around.

01:40:48.168 --> 01:40:51.253
"Oh, well. C'est la vie.

01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:55.632
"Maybe she'll move out, and I can
have the apartment to myself again.

01:40:55.633 --> 01:40:59.803
"Paying the rent seems
to be the only obstacle.

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:03.258
I'm sure it will work itself out."

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:11.648
Didn't you tell me you grew
up near Longview, Texas?

01:41:11.649 --> 01:41:14.109
Mm-hmm.

01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:18.739
- What town?
- Oh, it was more like a farm.

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:23.160
- Was it Quitman?
- I don't know.

01:41:23.161 --> 01:41:25.454
Why do you ask me
all these questions?

01:41:25.455 --> 01:41:29.291
Remember those people I brought
to see you at the hospital?

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:31.710
The old people?

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:34.914
Yeah.

01:41:37.175 --> 01:41:40.010
Remember who they were?

01:41:40.011 --> 01:41:43.006
How am I supposed to know?
They were in the wrong room.

01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:47.427
Whoever they were, they were lyin'.

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:52.106
Did you get your
Social Security card?

01:41:52.107 --> 01:41:56.110
What is this, the third degree?

01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:57.260
What are you gettin' at?

01:41:57.286 --> 01:41:59.780
You gave Miss Bunweill my
Social Security number...

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:03.534
- when you filled out your W-4 form.
- Who says I did?

01:42:03.535 --> 01:42:05.828
Both Dr. Maas and Miss Bunweill.

01:42:05.829 --> 01:42:08.031
Well, they're both wrong.

01:42:08.957 --> 01:42:11.542
Why would I do anything like that?

01:42:11.543 --> 01:42:14.002
I'm just tryin' to help you, Pinky.

01:42:14.003 --> 01:42:17.047
Will you stop callin' me that?

01:42:17.048 --> 01:42:20.050
How many times do I have to
tell you my name is Mildred?

01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:22.545
You got it? It's Mildred!

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.083
"Edgar's okay, I guess.
But he's pretty old.

01:42:53.084 --> 01:42:55.419
"At least he's making me laugh.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:59.624
"That's more than I can
say for what's-her-name.

01:43:00.884 --> 01:43:03.886
"I've been wondering about
my parents a lot lately...

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:06.930
"who they were, what they did.

01:43:06.931 --> 01:43:09.433
"Maybe I can trace them someday.

01:43:09.434 --> 01:43:13.645
"Lammoreaux is a
pretty unusual name.

01:43:13.646 --> 01:43:16.523
- I bet it's French -"
- How dare you read my diary.

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:19.610
Don't you ever touch it again.

01:43:19.611 --> 01:43:21.771
Do you hear me?

01:47:44.375 --> 01:47:47.210
Pinky?

01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:49.880
What's the matter?

01:47:49.881 --> 01:47:53.717
- I'm scared.
- What of?

01:47:53.718 --> 01:47:56.386
I had a bad dream.

01:47:56.387 --> 01:48:00.140
Dreams can't hurt ya.

01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:04.261
Can I sleep with you?

01:48:06.564 --> 01:48:08.724
Sure.

01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:19.576
Where ya goin'?

01:48:19.577 --> 01:48:23.322
I'm just going
to shut out the light.

01:50:04.432 --> 01:50:09.185
Oh! It's okay. It's just me. I am
just... I just came by for a visit.

01:50:09.186 --> 01:50:11.771
- What are you doin' here?
- I was...

01:50:11.772 --> 01:50:14.941
There wasn't anybody to talk
to, and I just thought I'd...

01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:16.221
What are you two doing in bed?

01:50:16.247 --> 01:50:18.695
You learning some new tricks
from my little Pinky Pinky?

01:50:18.696 --> 01:50:21.531
- Leave her alone.
- I wasn't gonna hurt anything.

01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:24.360
Get out of here right now,
or I'm gonna call the police.

01:50:25.244 --> 01:50:27.245
- The police?
- I mean it.

01:50:29.248 --> 01:50:31.750
The police, that's funny.
Those are all my pals.

01:50:31.751 --> 01:50:33.835
If they knew what was
happening, they'd be here...

01:50:33.836 --> 01:50:36.921
just celebrating,
because at this moment...

01:50:36.922 --> 01:50:39.382
right now, I'm becoming a father.

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:42.594
- Willie's havin' her baby now?
- Willie's having her baby now.

01:50:42.595 --> 01:50:45.889
- Who's with her?
- There isn't anybody with her.

01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:47.849
What do you mean,
there's nobody with her?

01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:50.727
There's nobody with her.
She doesn't need anybody.

01:50:50.728 --> 01:50:53.063
- Come on, Pinky.
- She doesn't need me.

01:50:53.064 --> 01:50:56.191
Where you gonna go, over there?
She doesn't need you either, honey.

01:50:56.192 --> 01:50:58.693
- She's... Pinky.
- Nobody needs you.

01:50:58.694 --> 01:51:01.188
- Pinky, why don't you stay here?
- Come on.

01:51:38.901 --> 01:51:42.070
Willie, I'm here to take
you to the hospital.

01:51:42.071 --> 01:51:44.614
It's too late. Get a doctor.

01:51:44.615 --> 01:51:46.825
- Get a doctor.
- Okay.

01:51:46.826 --> 01:51:51.037
Pinky, go to the hospital and get a doctor
and bring him right back here, you hear me?

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:55.117
Go on, Pinky! Do as I tell you!

01:51:56.627 --> 01:51:59.045
- Oh.
- God.

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:05.802
It's okay now, Willie.

01:52:05.803 --> 01:52:08.722
Pinky's gone to the hospital
to get you a doctor.

01:52:32.329 --> 01:52:35.165
- Willie, what should I do?
- Get, uh... Hurry!

01:52:35.166 --> 01:52:37.743
Get something.

01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:43.256
Baby's coming. Let me get my...

01:52:43.257 --> 01:52:48.212
My... Legs... Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

01:52:49.346 --> 01:52:52.307
I-I don't know how do this.

01:52:52.308 --> 01:52:55.018
Ohh.

01:52:55.019 --> 01:52:57.020
Hold!

01:52:57.021 --> 01:52:59.264
Push or something!

01:53:18.542 --> 01:53:21.878
- Pinky'll be back with the doctor.
- Oh! Oh!

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:33.389
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- You should try to push.

01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:37.602
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!

01:53:37.603 --> 01:53:41.056
Willie, I don't think I can...

01:53:43.359 --> 01:53:46.486
Something's coming out.

01:53:46.487 --> 01:53:48.738
Breathe! I ca... Ohhh!

01:53:48.739 --> 01:53:50.740
- There's a head coming out.
- Oh! Oh!

01:53:50.741 --> 01:53:53.193
What do I do?

01:54:15.516 --> 01:54:18.101
It's a head.

01:54:18.102 --> 01:54:20.520
I think it's not coming out.
It's too big.

01:54:20.521 --> 01:54:24.023
Willie. Willie, push!

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:26.526
Push, Willie. It's too big.

01:54:26.527 --> 01:54:29.229
There's a lot of blood, Willie.

01:54:38.038 --> 01:54:40.206
Willie, its head... it's too big.

01:54:40.207 --> 01:54:42.709
Willie, push.

01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:45.245
Willie, I can't deliver it.

01:54:52.219 --> 01:54:54.304
Willie, it's... it's a boy.

01:55:04.315 --> 01:55:07.442
Willie, he's so cold.

01:55:07.443 --> 01:55:10.153
I don't... I don't think
he's breathing.

01:55:10.154 --> 01:55:13.357
Willie, he's so cold.

01:55:19.997 --> 01:55:22.699
Ohh. My-My baby.

01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:27.021
He's dead.

01:56:38.534 --> 01:56:41.369
Y-You never went.

01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:44.156
You never went!

01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:44.943
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:58:46.703 --> 01:58:49.573
I'm gonna need to get somebody
to sign for this order.

01:58:50.624 --> 01:58:52.826
I'll get my mom.

01:59:09.726 --> 01:59:12.596
She's coming.

01:59:21.155 --> 01:59:25.275
Hi. I need to get you
to sign this order.

01:59:30.581 --> 01:59:33.082
Sure is horrible
what happened to old Edgar.

01:59:33.083 --> 01:59:36.252
Yes. It was a terrible accident.
We're all grieved by it.

01:59:36.253 --> 01:59:38.254
I just don't understand it...

01:59:38.255 --> 01:59:40.457
him being so good with guns
and everything.

01:59:41.675 --> 01:59:44.010
Okay. Thank you.

01:59:44.011 --> 01:59:46.213
Bye. I'll see ya.

01:59:49.474 --> 01:59:52.435
Come on, Millie. You're gonna
help me fix dinner tonight.

01:59:52.436 --> 01:59:55.138
The vegetables need washing.
Get that hair outta your face.

02:00:55.624 --> 02:00:58.452
- Want some Coke?
- Thank you, baby.

02:00:59.294 --> 02:01:01.337
I just had the most
wonderful dream.

02:01:01.338 --> 02:01:04.215
I was trying to remember it,
but I couldn't.

02:01:04.216 --> 02:01:07.169
All right, you two.
Time to come inside.

02:01:10.555 --> 02:01:12.757
Okay.

02:01:20.482 --> 02:01:22.767
Oh. Damn skirt.

02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:27.488
I'll fix that for you.

02:01:27.489 --> 02:01:30.108
Millie, get my sewing basket.

02:01:31.159 --> 02:01:33.494
Yes, ma'am.

02:01:33.495 --> 02:01:35.697
Where is it?

02:01:36.581 --> 02:01:39.166
You know where it is.

02:01:39.167 --> 02:01:41.536
Okay.

02:01:43.005 --> 02:01:46.007
And wash those potatoes for me.

02:01:46.008 --> 02:01:48.843
Yes, ma'am.

02:01:48.844 --> 02:01:50.962
All of them?

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:54.466
All of them.

02:01:55.434 --> 02:01:57.802
And put them in the pot.

02:02:00.439 --> 02:02:02.641
This pot?

02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:06.811
I'm not gonna answer that.

02:02:07.904 --> 02:02:10.781
Yes, ma'am.

02:02:10.782 --> 02:02:14.319
Don't know why you have
to be so mean to her.
