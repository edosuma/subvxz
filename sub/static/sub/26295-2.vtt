on my count.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.048
Everybody ready?

08:47.091 --> 08:48.658
One, two, three.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.573
Start a second IV
and get her on the monitors.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.140
- Right away.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.445
- No gross deformities,

08:53.489 --> 08:54.664
but she's got
some pretty nasty burns,

08:54.708 --> 08:56.100
including a full thickness,

08:56.144 --> 08:57.624
near circumferential
on her lower left arm.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.451
We need to get fluids in her.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.453
Pull us 500 of ringers

09:01.497 --> 09:03.455
at 200 per hour.
- Got it.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.022
- Wait, shouldn't we
use Parkland?

09:05.066 --> 09:07.285
Calculate fluid input based on
percentage of burn area.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.809
- First 24 hours are critical.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.550
We should start with
a higher volume of fluid.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.943
- That's not
standard procedure.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.728
- I've had experience
with burns in the military.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.861

09:32.180 --> 09:34.051

white coat syndrome?

Probably why your
blood pressure's

09:40.231 --> 09:41.537

Nothing serious.

a retinal burn, all right?

09:57.074 --> 09:58.641
