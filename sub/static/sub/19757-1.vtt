00:05.873 --> 00:07.416
Hey, Gus.

00:09.460 --> 00:13.756
I saw your Instagram
and I figured you might come here, so I...

00:14.423 --> 00:17.134
I'm, um... I just wanted to say...

00:17.218 --> 00:20.053
- Jesus, Mickey, come on...
- Just, I just want to apologize to you

00:20.137 --> 00:23.223
'cause I know I fucked everything up
and I'm really sorry,

00:23.307 --> 00:25.017
and I haven't been honest with you.

00:25.601 --> 00:29.188
There's a lot of stuff
that I didn't tell you about myself, um...

00:29.272 --> 00:30.314
I'm an addict.

00:30.398 --> 00:34.568
I'm, uh... I'm a drug addict
and I'm an alcoholic

00:34.652 --> 00:37.738
and I'm a sex and love addict and I...

00:38.656 --> 00:41.784
I think I need to just be by myself
for maybe, like, a year

00:41.867 --> 00:46.079
and try and figure this shit out,
but I wanted to say that I'm sorry to you

00:46.163 --> 00:52.461
because you were a great guy
and I really had such a good time with you

00:52.545 --> 00:55.047
and maybe in a year,

00:55.130 --> 00:57.466
if you're willing,

00:57.549 --> 01:00.052
I would love to get maybe a coffee
with you and...

01:18.570 --> 01:20.030
- No!
- What?

01:20.573 --> 01:23.451
No, dude, I just told you
that I wanted to be alone.

01:24.076 --> 01:25.786
Sorry. I just...

01:26.995 --> 01:28.581
Sorry. I don't know.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.001
I think that guy wants you to move.

01:33.085 --> 01:34.837
I think you're blocking him in
or something.

01:34.920 --> 01:39.216
Fine! I'm moving it. Calm down.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.718
- You fucking...
- Mickey!

01:40.801 --> 01:41.802
- Mickey!
- What?

01:41.885 --> 01:43.846
Wait, wait.

01:44.763 --> 01:46.932
Dude! Relax!

01:48.183 --> 01:49.518
Can we talk about this?

01:49.602 --> 01:51.770
Can we just go somewhere
and talk about this?

01:51.854 --> 01:53.564
Just get in the car!

02:00.363 --> 02:01.989
- Oh, shit! Stop.
- What?

02:02.072 --> 02:03.616
- What?
- I forgot my snacks.

02:03.699 --> 02:05.909
- Just leave 'em!
- I spent like $30...

02:05.993 --> 02:08.120
- Oh, my God, hurry up!
- Okay, I'll be right back.

02:08.203 --> 02:10.872
Forgot my snacks. Just...

02:10.955 --> 02:13.584
Hey, you moron,
there's another exit right there,

02:13.667 --> 02:14.752
why don't you just go?

02:14.835 --> 02:17.212
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

02:46.992 --> 02:48.911
- You want a snack?
- No.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.378
You like Twix?

02:59.505 --> 03:04.176
Um, also got, uh,
some Sour Patch Kids, some...

03:04.259 --> 03:05.594
Got one of these...

03:06.512 --> 03:10.015
kind of weird ice cream sandwich things.

03:10.098 --> 03:11.642
Why do you have so many snacks?

03:11.725 --> 03:15.228
Did, like, a fifth-grade class invite you
over for their slumber party?

03:16.522 --> 03:20.358
No. I guess...
I guess I'm just eating my feelings.

03:20.943 --> 03:22.736
That's too many feelings, dude.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.537
I'd take a Sour Patch Kid.

03:33.456 --> 03:34.498
Okay.

03:46.510 --> 03:47.720
All righty, cool.

03:47.803 --> 03:50.889
So, um, you wanna talk about the stuff
you were telling me?

03:50.973 --> 03:52.265
What stuff?

03:53.559 --> 03:54.852
You know, like...

03:55.978 --> 03:58.481
what you're going through, you know,

03:58.564 --> 04:01.900
being an addict and everything like that.

04:01.984 --> 04:04.265
I don't know. I feel like
I told you what I wanted to say.

04:04.319 --> 04:06.447
I thought you wanted to tell me something.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.868
No, I just... Yeah, I mean,
I guess I just figured since...

04:11.994 --> 04:13.787
I kissed you, like,
right after you told me,

04:13.871 --> 04:18.959
I didn't really give you
an opportunity to... unpack it.

04:19.041 --> 04:24.297
So... just letting you know,
uh, I'm here to listen.

04:24.381 --> 04:26.717
What are you doing?
Are you hitting on me? Don't.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.093
No.

04:28.176 --> 04:30.971
I don't know what you expect.
I don't want to have sex.

04:31.054 --> 04:34.307
Yeah, I... I don't wanna have sex either.
I guess I just...

04:37.310 --> 04:38.729
So you don't wanna talk about this?

04:38.812 --> 04:41.940
I told you that I wanted to be alone.
What else is there to say?

04:42.525 --> 04:45.068
Right. Okay.

04:46.403 --> 04:49.907
Sorry, I don't mean to be a bitch.
I just want this day to be over.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.243
- I wanna put on my house pants.
- Okay. Well...

04:53.326 --> 04:57.540
I'll get out of here then.
You know, just call an Uber to pick me up.

04:57.623 --> 04:59.374
- Perfect.
- Okay.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.215
Yes. Okay.

05:08.801 --> 05:10.468
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- Oh!

05:10.553 --> 05:12.095
- Hey!
- Huh?

05:14.848 --> 05:17.643
- I'm freaking out!
- Do you hear that?

05:17.726 --> 05:19.370
Is that...

05:19.394 --> 05:21.396
That is Bertie having sex.

05:21.479 --> 05:23.356
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Okay.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.900
She's really going at it.

05:24.983 --> 05:28.278
This is so weird.
When I picked her as a roommate,

05:28.361 --> 05:32.032
I specifically thought that I would never
have to hear her having sex.

05:32.115 --> 05:34.451
That's one of the reasons I picked her.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.720
- Yes!
- Who's she with?

05:35.744 --> 05:37.746
What's his name?
He's your friend, um...

05:37.830 --> 05:40.999
- My friend?
- What's his name? Randy.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.668
My Randy?

05:42.751 --> 05:43.812
Yeah. You don't know about this?

05:43.836 --> 05:46.004
I mean, I saw them talking
at my party and he...

05:46.088 --> 05:48.149
I mean, he's a cool guy. I get it, but...

05:48.173 --> 05:50.383
- Too fast. Okay.
- Shut... shut up.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.527
- Yes.
- Is he okay?

05:51.551 --> 05:52.654
I don't think so.

05:52.678 --> 05:54.739
- Yeah, I don't... I don't wanna hear this.
- Mnh-mnh.

05:54.763 --> 05:58.058
I shouldn't know what my friend sounds
like when he's having sex.

05:58.141 --> 06:01.561
I'd rather hear him screaming
while he burned in a fire.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.691
I'll be right back.
Just get some water.

06:18.286 --> 06:21.081
Oh, shit! Uh, hey.

06:21.164 --> 06:22.290
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:22.374 --> 06:24.209
Uh, I... I didn't know you were here.

06:24.292 --> 06:26.336
- Oh.
- Oh, you... you were here?

06:26.419 --> 06:30.883
Uh, yeah, I was just back in my room
listening to, uh... um, a TED Talk.

06:30.966 --> 06:33.426
TED Talk. Cool. Very cool.

06:33.510 --> 06:35.697
- Yeah, it was about city infrastructure.
- Ooh.

06:35.721 --> 06:36.764
I love TED Talks.

06:36.847 --> 06:37.931
It sounds like a good one.

06:38.015 --> 06:41.143
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's great. So, I'm gonna...

06:41.226 --> 06:42.978
go back to my room then,
'cause, you know...

06:43.061 --> 06:44.647
- Yeah.
- Bertie? You got a beer?

06:44.730 --> 06:48.191
- Whoa! Oh, hey, Gus.
- Hey.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.442
- Hey.
- Hey, Randy.

06:49.526 --> 06:50.819
- Hey.
- Mickey.

06:50.903 --> 06:52.279
- Mickey. Hey.
- Yeah.

06:52.362 --> 06:55.032
Sorry to surprise you here. We didn't...

06:55.115 --> 06:56.885
- We didn't mean to...
- Oh, it's cool.

06:56.909 --> 06:58.243
Okay.

06:58.326 --> 07:00.954
What are you, uh...

07:01.038 --> 07:02.039
Phew!

07:02.122 --> 07:03.456
Sorry.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.960
- I'm just super out of breath. Uh...
- Oh. It's okay.

07:07.044 --> 07:08.364
How long have you guys been here?

07:08.420 --> 07:10.631
They just got home,
and they didn't know we were here.

07:10.714 --> 07:12.549
Okay. Right. Right.

07:13.258 --> 07:16.136
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right. We were, uh...

07:16.219 --> 07:19.848
- We were moving around some furniture...
- Shush. No. No.

07:27.189 --> 07:28.231
Uh...

07:28.982 --> 07:30.025
We were having sex.

07:30.108 --> 07:31.568
- It's fine.
- Oh, it's okay.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.153
I know I can get pretty loud,

07:33.236 --> 07:35.572
and, uh, I think that's because
I have such a hard time

07:35.656 --> 07:37.449
expressing my emotions in real life,

07:37.532 --> 07:41.244
so then, uh, when I'm making love,
I just really let it all out,

07:41.328 --> 07:42.537
like, screaming and stuff.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.789
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

07:43.872 --> 07:46.041
Right on. Let it fly.
Uh, no judgments here. No.

07:46.124 --> 07:47.852
- Yeah.
- That's why I'm out of breath.

07:47.876 --> 07:49.270
You know what? Are you hungry?
Let's get some food.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.755
Yeah. I'm gonna...
We're gonna get some food.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.548
- Okay.
- All right. Hey.

07:53.631 --> 07:55.342
Whoa.

07:55.425 --> 07:56.426
- Whoops.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.512
- No, that's okay.
- So sorry.

08:00.764 --> 08:03.641
Jesus! I never wanted this night
to go on this long.

08:03.726 --> 08:07.479
I just wanted to tell you my deal
and then just go home.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.150
Your deal with, um, Sex Anonymous?

08:12.234 --> 08:16.613
Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous.
SLAA. Yeah.

08:17.572 --> 08:20.033
So what's the deal with that?
Is it like a...

08:20.117 --> 08:23.996
a rule of theirs
that you can't have sex for a year, or...

08:24.079 --> 08:27.290
You're not not allowed to do anything.
It's not a cult.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.459
Right. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:29.542 --> 08:35.256
It's more about learning how to not
pig out on sex and love and relationships.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.385
Right. It's like the Atkins Diet
but instead of carbs, it's sex.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.095
This is actually serious.

08:40.178 --> 08:42.847
No. I know and I was not trying
to make fun of it.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.933
It was like a point of comparison, of...

08:46.518 --> 08:48.061
Yeah. I don't know.

08:48.854 --> 08:50.814
I just feel like, for me,

08:50.898 --> 08:54.484
I just need to take a year off
and get my head on straight.

08:55.944 --> 08:58.655
That's good. That's cool. Good for you.

08:59.531 --> 09:00.532
Thank you.

09:00.615 --> 09:06.079
And, you know, just so... you know,
for the record or whatever...

09:08.331 --> 09:10.667
I know I was being a dick there,

09:10.751 --> 09:14.004
like when you showed up at my party and...

09:14.087 --> 09:17.507
on the lot that day
and the whole Heidi thing.

09:17.590 --> 09:21.469
Yeah. The whole Heidi thing.
That was a trip.

09:21.553 --> 09:24.807
Which is over, by the way.
It's, like, done.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.724
- None of my business.
- Right. Right.

09:26.809 --> 09:31.563
Honestly, I'm just not that equipped
to deal with a situation where I'm...

09:32.773 --> 09:37.694
juggling women or whatever, you know.
I'm not Warren Beatty.

09:38.736 --> 09:41.406
Not even Ned Beatty.

09:41.489 --> 09:44.034
I guess I was worried that
if after we had sex,

09:44.117 --> 09:48.080
I started texting you or calling you,
you would just be like,

09:48.163 --> 09:51.291
"Who is this fucking dork?"

09:51.875 --> 09:55.963
Dude, you took me to the Magic Castle.
I already knew you were a dork.

09:56.046 --> 09:57.923
Yeah.

09:58.924 --> 10:00.508
And look, I'm sorry, too.

10:00.592 --> 10:05.097
I'm sorry I showed up at your work
and freaked out in front of everybody.

10:06.598 --> 10:08.016
God, I really lost it.

10:08.934 --> 10:10.978
It's really not a big deal.

10:11.061 --> 10:13.605
- You done?
- Yes.

10:14.731 --> 10:16.316
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

10:56.314 --> 10:59.109
- All right. Here you are.
- Okay.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.153
- Thank you for the ride.
- Yeah. Oh, just...

11:02.654 --> 11:04.572
- as an FYI...
- Mmm-hmm.

11:04.656 --> 11:06.296
even though I'm taking a year off dating,

11:06.366 --> 11:07.993
I still wanna be friends.

11:08.076 --> 11:11.454
- Oh, yeah. Totally. Me, too.
- Okay.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.539
Okay.

11:13.456 --> 11:17.377
- You okay? You're a little squirmy there.
- Yeah. I just really have to pee.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.460
Oh.

11:18.962 --> 11:21.089
Would... Do you wanna come in?
Use my restroom?

11:21.173 --> 11:24.384
Um, okay, but then I'm gonna...
I'm gonna head out after that.

11:24.467 --> 11:25.928
Oh. Of course. Yes. Definitely.

11:26.011 --> 11:27.220
Okay.

11:32.935 --> 11:35.687
It's weird that you call
your bathroom a restroom.

11:35.770 --> 11:36.896
I know!

11:36.980 --> 11:39.441
While I was saying that,
I was like, "That's weird."

11:39.524 --> 11:43.070
- Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

11:43.861 --> 11:45.197
Why do you have this ugly,

11:45.280 --> 11:47.699
giant piece of pasta hanging
from your wall?

11:47.782 --> 11:51.911
Ugh, I know. It's awful.
It came with the place.

11:51.995 --> 11:54.081
None of this stuff is mine, by the way.

11:54.164 --> 11:57.834
- There's a real reality TV vibe about it.
- Hmm.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.754
Like <i>The Real Divorced Dads
of Sherman Oaks.</i>

12:01.838 --> 12:07.427
Yeah, or, uh,
<i>Home Makeover: Sad Asshole Edition.</i>

12:08.553 --> 12:10.639
What is this thing you're always carrying?

12:11.764 --> 12:14.726
Oh, my cell phone-wallet thing?

12:14.809 --> 12:17.312
You're just gonna dig through it,
is that it? Okay.

12:17.395 --> 12:20.357
- Three singles? Real moneybags, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

12:24.652 --> 12:26.363
I love that you carry this in your wallet.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.491
I don't know.
They could make a comeback, right?

12:29.574 --> 12:31.951
In high school,
it was my dream to work there,

12:32.035 --> 12:33.745
but I was too intimidated to apply

12:33.828 --> 12:36.623
because all the cool older kids
from school worked there.

12:36.706 --> 12:38.833
Mmm. You weren't a cool kid?

12:40.877 --> 12:42.545
I find that hard to believe.

12:43.171 --> 12:45.340
In high school,
you would have totally intimidated me.

12:45.423 --> 12:47.134
- No!
- Yeah. No doubt.

12:47.217 --> 12:49.844
I was so nice to the losers.

12:49.927 --> 12:52.222
Hmm. Uh-huh.

12:54.016 --> 12:57.519
You know, I wasn't that big
of a loser in high school.

12:58.936 --> 13:02.565
Don't want to brag,
but I was homecoming king.

13:05.277 --> 13:06.986
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:07.070 --> 13:09.572
I mean, it was a class size
of, like, 40 people,

13:09.656 --> 13:12.242
so I didn't have to impress
too many folks, but...

13:12.742 --> 13:14.452
yeah, I was homecoming king.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.624
I should go.

13:19.707 --> 13:21.834
Okay. Yeah.

13:24.003 --> 13:28.633
- I'll, uh... see you around.
- All right. Yeah. Whatever.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.386
What is going on?

13:33.763 --> 13:35.515
What the fuck is that?

13:46.443 --> 13:50.197
Holy shit.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.116
Maybe we should go inside.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.161
It feels, like, a little dangerous
to be out here. You know what I mean?

13:56.244 --> 13:58.371
Jeez, Chris!

13:58.455 --> 14:01.208
- I got you good, man!
- You scared me.

14:01.291 --> 14:03.126
Whoo. You scared me there.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.752
- Ah, I had to do that, man.
- Ah.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.004
Oh, hey, Mickey, right?

14:07.089 --> 14:08.340
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey.

14:08.423 --> 14:09.841
Mickey, you remember Chris, yeah?

14:09.924 --> 14:13.803
Totally. Yeah, we met the night
I couldn't rhyme <i>Carlito's Way.</i>

14:13.887 --> 14:17.098
Oh, that's right.
That's a tough word, though.

14:17.182 --> 14:19.184
- It is. It's very tough. Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.810
Whoo! How crazy is this, huh?

14:20.893 --> 14:21.936
Yeah.

14:22.019 --> 14:23.688
Whoa! God, man,

14:23.771 --> 14:25.815
I feel like I'm in a video game right now.

14:25.898 --> 14:26.941
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:27.025 --> 14:30.278
- Exactly. This is, like, unreal right now.
- God, it's so weird...

14:30.361 --> 14:32.781
- What are you two doing?
- Oh, we're just hanging out.

14:32.864 --> 14:34.824
- Oh.
- I gotta get home.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.077
Okay, folks, you need to go
back inside immediately.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.370
Oh, shit.

14:38.453 --> 14:41.206
Um, Officer, sorry, uh,

14:41.289 --> 14:43.500
I don't live here,
so could I just go to my car

14:43.583 --> 14:46.711
and I'll just get out of here.
One less person you have to worry about.

14:46.794 --> 14:49.232
Springwood is on lockdown.
Nobody can leave until further notice.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.550
But see, the thing is,
I've got some extenuating circumstances

14:52.634 --> 14:54.594
that necessitate me leaving now.

14:54.677 --> 14:56.638
What part of "go inside"
don't you understand?

14:56.721 --> 14:59.002
Go inside now. We'll let you know
when it's safe to leave.

14:59.390 --> 15:00.390
Fine. Whatever.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.353
Ugh. What a d-bag.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.188
Hey, Frank, Allan. What's up?

15:05.272 --> 15:08.275
Check out the cop cars.
Looks like my ride's here.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.945
That's funny. That's good.

15:13.029 --> 15:14.673
Hey, what the hell's going on here?
You guys know?

15:14.697 --> 15:16.073
- You guys don't know?
- Unh-unh.

15:16.158 --> 15:17.700
There was a car chase on the freeway

15:17.784 --> 15:19.702
that made its way here
into the Springwood.

15:19.786 --> 15:22.539
Then the wacko crashes his car
into the rec center

15:22.622 --> 15:24.291
- and takes off running.
- Oh, my God.

15:24.374 --> 15:27.270
And now the cops, they're searching
the grounds, trying to catch this guy.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.087
- Wow. What are they after him for?
- Drug trafficking.

15:30.172 --> 15:31.756
Really? You know that for sure?

15:31.839 --> 15:35.009
No. But I guarantee you
it's drug trafficking.

15:35.092 --> 15:37.804
That's why he ran.
That's what drug traffickers do. They run.

15:37.887 --> 15:40.348
Or maybe he robbed a convenience store
and he's on the run?

15:40.432 --> 15:42.826
Maybe he's got a bunch
of parking tickets he hasn't paid for.

15:42.850 --> 15:43.893
Could be a serial killer.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.478
- I like that.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:45.562 --> 15:47.147
'Cause he's worried if he gets caught,

15:47.230 --> 15:49.649
they'll be able to tie him
to all his unsolved murders.

15:49.732 --> 15:51.568
And who's, uh, Inspector Poirot here?

15:51.651 --> 15:54.196
Oh, this is Mickey. Mickey, Frank, Allan.

15:54.279 --> 15:58.533
Allan, Frank, Mickey.
Do you guys wanna go inside?

15:58.616 --> 15:59.951
You know what? Come to our place.

16:00.034 --> 16:02.119
- Come on.
- It's safer if we stick together.

16:02.204 --> 16:03.806
If we don't stick together,
we die.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.997
No, we don't.

16:05.081 --> 16:07.500
I don't know all the facts,
but come on, let's hang out.

16:07.584 --> 16:08.585
Come on. Let's go.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.505
- Is this cool?
- Yeah, I mean, safety in numbers.

16:14.591 --> 16:16.176
Oh, I call massage chair.

16:16.259 --> 16:18.970
Hey, the secret of that thing
is to use the neck roller

16:19.053 --> 16:21.013
and the vibration mode at the same time.

16:21.097 --> 16:23.683
Hey, whoa, whoa,
would you be easy on it, though, right?

16:23.766 --> 16:26.269
I got a date next week,
and it needs to be functional.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.646
Guys, I like this place.

16:28.730 --> 16:30.648
- Very, very cool.
- Thank you.

16:30.732 --> 16:31.917
Why's yours different than Gus'?

16:31.941 --> 16:34.141
I thought all these places
were supposed to be the same.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.779
This is how it was when we first moved in.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.199
Management wanted to redecorate
a couple of years ago,

16:39.282 --> 16:40.968
- but we liked it like it was.
- That's right.

16:40.992 --> 16:43.273
This is our place
and no one's gonna tell us to change it.

16:43.328 --> 16:44.871
Yeah, plus, give it a couple of years.

16:44.954 --> 16:47.749
Southwestern decor
is gonna make a big comeback.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.632
You know, that's true.
I just read an article.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.045
Every 20 years, trends recycle.

16:53.129 --> 16:55.089
How long do these lockdowns usually last?

16:55.172 --> 16:57.342
Ugh, I don't know. Ten hours?

16:57.425 --> 16:58.801
- Give or take.
- Yeah.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.470
- Shit. Really?
- Yeah.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.846
Once there was a lockdown

17:01.929 --> 17:04.391
because Allan forgot his duffel bag
at the rec center

17:04.473 --> 17:10.396
- and they thought it was a bomb.
- Oh, ridiculous. It was October 2001.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.732
So everyone's living in a culture of fear.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.358
Oh, I remember those days, man.

17:14.442 --> 17:17.819
Before that,
you could bring a box cutter on a plane,

17:17.904 --> 17:19.989
but then after, it was a whole thing.

17:21.782 --> 17:22.867
Hey, Mickey, I'm sorry.

17:22.950 --> 17:25.453
I feel like I forced you to come out here
and now you're stuck.

17:25.537 --> 17:27.664
It's fine, dude.
You didn't force me to do anything.

17:27.747 --> 17:31.000
Hey. Let's take this conversation
to the conversation pit.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.836
- Hey, look at that now.
- Oh, you guys have a telescope.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.299
Maybe I could, like,
see a way to my car from here.

17:37.382 --> 17:39.902
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Be careful with that, little girl.

17:39.967 --> 17:42.136
You're gonna mess up my equatorial mount.

17:42.219 --> 17:43.680
God, this is, like, so fun.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.643
I'm only seeing buildings,
buildings, buildings.

17:45.723 --> 17:47.183
What are you looking for?

17:47.267 --> 17:49.977
I'm looking for my car.
I'm trying to find a way to my car.

17:50.061 --> 17:51.580
What parking lot are you in?
Do you remember?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.481
I think E. Does that make sense?

17:53.565 --> 17:54.649
- It does.
- Okay.

17:54.732 --> 17:56.585
- Can you see E...
- You cannot see E from here.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.769
You can see pretty much
the other parts of the complex.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.020
What do you wanna do? Get out?

18:00.071 --> 18:01.471
- Yeah.
- I can get you out of here.

18:02.156 --> 18:05.159
Hey, so what's, uh...
What's going on over here, dude?

18:05.242 --> 18:06.911
- With, like, Mickey? Or...
- Yeah.

18:06.994 --> 18:09.997
- You guys, like, hooking up?
- No. No.

18:10.081 --> 18:14.919
Actually we're in a bit of a Meryl Streep,
Alec Baldwin situation right now.

18:15.837 --> 18:17.464
- Huh?
- It's complicated.

18:17.547 --> 18:19.048
- Oh.
- Oh.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.342
Very nice.

18:20.425 --> 18:21.509
Yeah.

18:21.593 --> 18:24.637
Well, it's not great but, uh...
Yeah, I don't know.

18:24.721 --> 18:29.100
I mean, for a number of reasons
we're actually trying not to hook up,

18:29.892 --> 18:32.312
so this lockdown is not helping things.

18:32.395 --> 18:34.772
Oh. Got ya.

18:34.856 --> 18:36.649
- The temptation here...
- Yeah.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.443
There's a lot of excitement in the air.

18:38.526 --> 18:40.528
A lot of tension. Like, you can feel it.

18:40.612 --> 18:42.905
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's, like, electric. Yeah.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.717
Think about all the people
who are fucking tonight.

18:44.741 --> 18:46.868
- Yeah.
- Like, nine months from now,

18:46.951 --> 18:50.830
there's gonna be all these Springwood
lockdown babies running around.

18:50.913 --> 18:52.832
Hey, guys, what if we took this up
on the roof?

18:52.915 --> 18:55.167
And maybe I could find,
like, a route to my car.

18:55.251 --> 18:57.504
Yeah, sure, I like that idea.
What do you think?

18:57.587 --> 18:58.755
- Yeah.
- Hey.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.632
I'm gonna get the BB guns for safety.

19:00.715 --> 19:02.800
- They're in the hobby closet.
- I know.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.301
Yeah, that's smart thinking.

19:04.386 --> 19:06.763
I mean, as long as the cops
don't think we're some sniper

19:06.846 --> 19:08.526
and try to take us out or anything. Right?

19:08.598 --> 19:10.642
Sounds like this night's
just getting started.

19:15.146 --> 19:19.108
Uh, look it, boxes of wine and condoms.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.361
Wow, somebody had
a real party up here.

19:21.444 --> 19:23.905
Ugh, you know what, Gus? Forget my car.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.073
- Yeah?
- It's hopeless. I've just...

19:26.157 --> 19:28.576
My only shot
is to get over the property line

19:28.660 --> 19:30.453
and then call for an Uber.

19:30.537 --> 19:34.457
Okay. Well, yeah, I mean, if you think
that'd work, you should go for it.

19:34.541 --> 19:38.335
- I think if I can get to that fence...
- Uh-huh.

19:38.420 --> 19:39.837
- and scale it...
- Yeah.

19:39.921 --> 19:42.549
and just run through those trees...

19:42.632 --> 19:43.841
No, I can see that. Yes.

19:43.925 --> 19:45.051
Yeah.

19:46.094 --> 19:50.014
- Why? What are you thinking? What's wrong?
- All right. I just... I need a smoke.

19:50.098 --> 19:52.433
- I need a smoke.
- Okay.

19:59.649 --> 20:01.419
All I can see is a tree.
Let me adjust this.

20:01.443 --> 20:04.779
No, I told you,
I'll do the adjusting. Come on.

20:06.698 --> 20:09.241
- You need help with that?
- Yeah.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.791
There you go.

20:18.876 --> 20:21.463
- I should get out of here.
- Yeah.

20:21.546 --> 20:25.174
You sure, with this fucking maniac
running around here?

20:25.258 --> 20:28.428
Yeah. 'Cause if I stay,
you know, it's gonna be...

20:29.762 --> 20:32.807
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no. I get it.

20:34.391 --> 20:37.019
Well, can I go with you?
I think I'd feel a lot better

20:37.103 --> 20:40.565
if I could just get you to the road,
to the Uber and stuff.

20:40.648 --> 20:43.275
Like a... covert mission.

20:43.359 --> 20:44.652
- Right.
- Yeah.

20:44.736 --> 20:47.029
Like a total covert mission situation.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.740
- That's cool.
- Okay.

20:48.823 --> 20:50.074
- Yeah. Hey!
- Let's do it.

20:50.157 --> 20:52.034
Guys, I'm gonna make a run for it.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.203
Yeah. I'm gonna help Mickey
with her great escape.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.081
I'll tell you what,
take the BB gun for protection.

20:57.582 --> 20:59.041
- Oh...
- Mmm, no, thank you.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.769
- That's all right.
- Then take the flashlight.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.270
But if you do this,
you got to do it right.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.814
- If you hold it from the front...
- Uh-huh.

21:03.838 --> 21:05.047
it's not only a flashlight.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.800
Bam! It becomes a billy club. Bow. Boom.

21:07.884 --> 21:09.426
- Whoa. Uh...
- No, thank you.

21:09.511 --> 21:11.763
I think that'll do more harm than good,
but thank you.

21:11.846 --> 21:13.726
- All right. Appreciate it.
- Thanks. Bye, guys.

21:14.682 --> 21:16.476
- Take no prisoners. Okay?
- All right.

21:16.559 --> 21:19.521
God, it's nights like this
I wish I had a remote-control drone.

21:23.024 --> 21:24.400
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.948
Go to the left. Go to the left.

21:33.701 --> 21:38.540
Hey, what the fuck are you two doing
down there? Are you crazy?

21:38.623 --> 21:41.250
Please, can you just be quiet?
We're just...

21:41.333 --> 21:43.294
You're gonna get yourselves killed!

21:43.377 --> 21:45.004
Is this what you fucking do?

21:45.087 --> 21:47.483
You just come out on your balcony
and yell at people all night?

21:47.507 --> 21:48.841
Is that... That's your fun?

21:48.925 --> 21:52.219
I fucking have a full, rich life,
all right? This is part of it.

21:52.303 --> 21:53.947
Great. I don't have time for this.
We gotta go.

21:53.971 --> 21:56.473
You assholes! You're gonna get killed!

22:02.939 --> 22:05.733
- Oh, man, this is kind of cool.
- Yeah!

22:05.817 --> 22:08.152
- It's got my blood pumping, you know?
- Totally!

22:08.235 --> 22:10.655
It's a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

22:10.738 --> 22:12.949
You and me should try and pull off
a crime sometime.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.951
Yeah, let's rob a bank this weekend.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.494
I think if we go down the storm drain,
we'll hit that fence.

22:17.579 --> 22:18.830
- Let's go.
- Okay.

22:24.585 --> 22:26.087
Oh, I like this.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.172
Feels like we're in SEAL Team 6
or something.

22:28.255 --> 22:30.299
I just wanna go out
and kill Osama bin Laden.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.096
So, uh, you see that road yet?

22:35.179 --> 22:36.579
You wanna call your Uber now, or...

22:36.639 --> 22:38.515
- No. I think we're close, though.
- Okay.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.578
Thanks for coming with me on this mission.
This was cool.

22:40.602 --> 22:42.228
Yeah. It's fun, right?

22:42.311 --> 22:44.480
So do you think... What?

22:44.563 --> 22:45.648
Do you hear that?

22:46.983 --> 22:48.359
No.

22:48.442 --> 22:49.986
I think somebody's nearby.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.197
Are you fucking with me?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.324
That's not a cool trick
to play on somebody like me.

22:55.407 --> 22:56.575
No. Listen.

22:57.493 --> 22:59.453
Fuck.

22:59.536 --> 23:01.372
Is it coming closer?

23:01.455 --> 23:02.725
It sounds like it's coming closer, right?

23:02.749 --> 23:04.751
Fuck. I think it is. This is really scary.

23:04.834 --> 23:06.919
- Fuck.
- Straight ahead.

23:07.003 --> 23:09.463
- Oh, fuck, it's the cops. Let's run.
- Okay.

23:09.546 --> 23:11.986
No, no, no. Let's stay here.
We'll hide and then they'll pass.

23:12.049 --> 23:13.592
- Fuck that. I'm running.
- No. Mickey.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.889
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This is stupid!

23:18.723 --> 23:20.850
Run faster! We can lose them.

23:20.933 --> 23:21.976
Fuck.

23:23.144 --> 23:25.437
Oh, shit! Are you okay?

23:25.521 --> 23:27.857
Yeah. I'm okay. Run!

23:27.940 --> 23:29.776
- Run!
- Fuck.

23:31.068 --> 23:33.487
- Hey! Hey, you!
- There he is.

23:34.321 --> 23:35.322
Stop!

23:36.073 --> 23:37.616
Whoa.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.285
Police! Stop! Stop now!

23:39.368 --> 23:42.121
- Stop! Put your hands up now!
- Okay.

23:42.204 --> 23:44.415
- We found our guy.
- No. I'm not your guy.

23:44.498 --> 23:47.501
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay. Oh, Jesus.

23:47.584 --> 23:49.712
- Don't move.
- I'm not. I'm just...

23:49.796 --> 23:50.898
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to.

23:50.922 --> 23:54.133
It's just when I get nervous,
my hands and my arms start to shake. Okay?

23:54.216 --> 23:55.885
- Do you wanna get shot?
- No, no, no, no!

23:55.968 --> 23:58.929
I respect the police force!
I respect police. My uncle's a cop.

23:59.013 --> 24:00.848
My uncle's a cop!
My Uncle Rodger's a cop!

24:00.932 --> 24:03.893
- Where does he work?
- He lives in South Dakota.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.312
- You're a liar!
- I'm from the Midwest!

24:06.395 --> 24:09.273
Hey! No.
He's not the guy you're looking for.

24:09.356 --> 24:10.983
It's okay. Leave him alone.

24:11.067 --> 24:13.861
Mickey, stop.
You're not helping, okay.

24:13.945 --> 24:17.114
Gus! Oh, my God.
Gus, are you okay?

24:17.198 --> 24:19.283
- I'm innocent.
- He is innocent. He is.

24:19.366 --> 24:21.166
He was just trying
to help me get out of here.

24:21.243 --> 24:23.371
Fuck.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.584
Oh, God damn.

24:31.713 --> 24:32.839
Here's your ice.

24:32.922 --> 24:35.883
Thank you so much.

24:35.967 --> 24:38.510
I'm sorry I didn't get to the cops faster.

24:38.594 --> 24:40.763
Oh, it's totally cool.

24:41.764 --> 24:46.310
- Sorry we didn't get you out of here.
- Well, sure tried.

24:47.729 --> 24:48.938
Yeah.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.649
Yeah, we did.

24:56.946 --> 24:58.155
Oh, man.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.701
I am wiped out.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.454
Dude, can I just crash here?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.126
Yeah.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.628
Cool.

25:29.353 --> 25:32.106
If we were gonna kiss,
it would be right now.

25:34.150 --> 25:35.234
Yeah.

25:37.444 --> 25:38.445
But...

25:40.656 --> 25:41.949
Yeah.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.713
Nighty-night.

26:05.723 --> 26:07.534
