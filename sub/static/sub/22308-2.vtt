00:01.656 --> 00:02.621
This is insane.

00:02.657 --> 00:03.923
An all-new season kicked off

00:03.958 --> 00:05.758
with a shocking twist.

00:05.793 --> 00:09.061
Please welcome
your new champion coaches.

00:09.113 --> 00:10.062
[All cheer]

00:10.114 --> 00:11.146
I can't wait.

00:11.182 --> 00:12.998
Deep breath.

00:13.034 --> 00:16.735
The champion-led teams were
tasked with creating two aliens

00:16.771 --> 00:17.853
for a movie legend...

00:17.905 --> 00:20.840
Seven-time Academy Award winner
Rick Baker.

00:20.892 --> 00:22.825
- [Whistles]
- Yeah!

00:22.877 --> 00:25.110
I'm ecstatic.

00:25.146 --> 00:26.428
But that was only the beginning.

00:26.464 --> 00:28.414
Can you see the sweat
on my forehead?

00:28.449 --> 00:29.381
It's all over the place.

00:29.433 --> 00:30.649
- Okay.
- Needs a lot more work.

00:30.685 --> 00:32.250
Oh, my God.

00:32.286 --> 00:34.687
I have another big surprise
for you.

00:34.722 --> 00:37.590
You'll be making
a third character.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.758
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

00:39.794 --> 00:41.360
Things are about to get real.

00:41.395 --> 00:42.661
In the end, only one

00:42.697 --> 00:45.164
will win a VIP trip
from Kryolan Professional Make-Up

00:45.199 --> 00:48.300
to one of their 85
international locations,

00:48.336 --> 00:50.936
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:50.972 --> 00:53.939
and $100,000.

00:53.941 --> 00:57.343
Find out what happens right now.

01:36.684 --> 01:39.718
I have another big surprise
for you.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.553
There's a huge piece
of information

01:41.606 --> 01:43.289
that I didn't share
with you yesterday.

01:43.324 --> 01:45.291
What now?

01:45.326 --> 01:47.726
There's something going on,
and I don't know what it is,

01:47.762 --> 01:49.028
but things
are about to get real.

01:49.063 --> 01:52.197
Your spacecraft
didn't crash-land on Earth.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.800
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

01:54.802 --> 01:57.953
It crash-landed on a planet
controlled by primates

01:58.005 --> 02:02.124
who are not happy
to see your alien invaders.

02:02.159 --> 02:05.894
So you'll each be choosing
one of these simians

02:05.947 --> 02:08.847
as inspiration for

02:08.883 --> 02:09.949
a third character.

02:09.984 --> 02:12.885
[Chuckling]

02:12.920 --> 02:15.454
We had a plan,
and now that's out the door.

02:15.489 --> 02:16.722
That's right.

02:16.757 --> 02:19.024
You'll be making a tyrannical
primate ruler

02:19.060 --> 02:20.759
who has no interest

02:20.811 --> 02:22.561
in making your alien intruders
feel at home.

02:22.596 --> 02:23.829
[Sighs]

02:23.864 --> 02:25.164
Keep in mind, Rick is the one

02:25.199 --> 02:26.999
who created
those incredible makeups

02:27.034 --> 02:28.767
in Tim Burton's
<i>Planet Of The Apes,</i>

02:28.803 --> 02:31.003
and he won an Academy Award
for his work

02:31.038 --> 02:35.541
in <i> Harry And The Hendersons,</i>
so this is not going to be easy.

02:35.576 --> 02:37.710
And I want you guys
to have every opportunity

02:37.762 --> 02:39.411
to impress Rick Baker,

02:39.447 --> 02:44.466
so I'm going to give you
an extra day for this challenge.

02:44.502 --> 02:46.251
Yes. Yes.

02:46.287 --> 02:47.686
Oh, thank God.

02:47.722 --> 02:51.340
We have this extra day to do
some type of monkey makeup.

02:51.392 --> 02:53.292
This should be interesting.

02:53.327 --> 02:55.194
Now that we have
all that nasty monkey business

02:55.229 --> 02:57.429
out of the way,
let's pick your primates.

02:57.465 --> 03:01.633
Your options are
squirrel monkey, brown lemur,

03:01.669 --> 03:05.120
white-faced capuchin, mandrill,

03:05.156 --> 03:06.939
and we have the olive baboon.

03:06.974 --> 03:08.874
Team Laura, you get first pick.

03:08.909 --> 03:10.843
Yes.

03:10.878 --> 03:11.944
That one's adorable.

03:11.979 --> 03:13.412
That face
is really expressive too,

03:13.447 --> 03:14.446
so I think we could do that.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.731
I agree.

03:15.766 --> 03:18.283
We're gonna pick
the squirrel monkey.

03:18.319 --> 03:19.785
- Okay, Team Anthony?
- All right.

03:19.837 --> 03:22.287
- We're gonna pick the mandrill.
- And Rayce?

03:22.323 --> 03:26.125
We're going to go
with the white-faced capuchin.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.360
All right, guys,
why don't you take some time

03:28.412 --> 03:30.362
to work on your new designs

03:30.398 --> 03:33.582
while we have these amazing
monkeys right here in the lab?

03:33.617 --> 03:35.467
- Good luck.
- Bye.

03:38.606 --> 03:39.822
I like this profile.

03:39.857 --> 03:41.206
- We're gonna make him a...
- Ruler.

03:41.242 --> 03:42.875
- Tyrant.
- Like a tyrant.

03:42.877 --> 03:44.209
That's what I was thinking,
like,

03:44.211 --> 03:45.594
the scars
would come in to play at.

03:45.629 --> 03:48.297
'Cause a tyrant
is not a pretty person.

03:48.349 --> 03:51.984
Our original story
was two aliens from a cooler,

03:52.019 --> 03:53.285
aquatic planet,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.187
and one is older than the other.

03:55.189 --> 03:56.405
And now, our monkey,

03:56.440 --> 03:58.757
he's a tyrannical monkey
that hunts aliens

03:58.793 --> 04:02.127
because they just drop a lot
of their cargo on his planet.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.100
So, our team
chooses the mandrill monkey.

04:08.135 --> 04:09.635
Oh, and his butt.
[Gasps]

04:09.670 --> 04:10.769
Let's give him a pink butt.

04:10.805 --> 04:12.071
In our original idea,

04:12.106 --> 04:13.906
the smaller alien is the pilot,

04:13.941 --> 04:16.208
and the larger alien
is the protector.

04:16.243 --> 04:19.411
So our concept for the third
character is pretty basic.

04:19.447 --> 04:20.646
He's gonna be the ruler

04:20.680 --> 04:24.316
of this planet
that is strictly just a monkey.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.485
He's not supposed
to be some hybrid.

04:28.672 --> 04:31.356
Think you want to stay
with the tribal theme?

04:31.392 --> 04:35.227
My team opts to go
with the white-faced capuchin.

04:35.229 --> 04:37.696
This particular monkey
is 25 years old,

04:37.731 --> 04:40.132
and she looks it,
so we're going to run with that.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.417
I think we should tie them
together somehow, like,

04:42.470 --> 04:43.969
the apes are the higher thing,

04:44.004 --> 04:45.804
and then, the arachnid are...
are their slaves.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.007
It's gonna be the warriors,
the beasts, the slaves?

04:49.059 --> 04:50.008
I like that.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.411
Our original concept was,

04:52.446 --> 04:56.715
this higher intelligence
alien crashes on this planet

04:56.750 --> 04:59.685
where arachnid
is the native species.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.056
So our monkey is the ruler
of this planet,

05:04.091 --> 05:06.358
and she's enslaved the arachnid.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.594
And she's an old character.

05:08.629 --> 05:10.729
She was born into royalty.

05:10.731 --> 05:11.930
I'm liking this though.

05:11.932 --> 05:13.432
This... what you have here.

05:13.434 --> 05:14.933
Okay, then we can start working.

05:21.925 --> 05:24.242
I think my team is very
excited about this twist.

05:24.278 --> 05:27.212
Alan gets to step up
from the fabrication

05:27.247 --> 05:29.414
and start doing
some more sculpting.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.233
I'm trying to make sure
that I keep in line

05:31.285 --> 05:32.234
with his nose like this.

05:32.269 --> 05:33.352
Yeah, I agree.

05:33.404 --> 05:35.153
I have a pretty good knowledge

05:35.189 --> 05:36.738
of animal anatomy,
including monkeys,

05:36.790 --> 05:38.256
but I know Rick Baker

05:38.292 --> 05:40.559
is gonna look
at that face extra close.

05:40.594 --> 05:42.744
I'm sure Rick Baker
will be looking for details.

05:46.533 --> 05:47.966
First thing I need to do

05:48.001 --> 05:51.002
is finish detailing
this alien warrior face.

05:51.038 --> 05:52.587
These holes... are they plugged?

05:52.639 --> 05:54.639
- Or they go all the way back?
- They go all the way back.

05:54.675 --> 05:56.641
You might want to put
a little bit of clay in there,

05:56.643 --> 05:59.144
'cause otherwise, if the plaster
goes all the way through and...

05:59.146 --> 06:01.113
- It might lock.
- It might lock, yeah.

06:01.148 --> 06:03.915
I know that I should've been
finished and in the mold room

06:03.917 --> 06:06.952
yesterday, so right now,
I am just thinking,

06:06.987 --> 06:10.288
"I need to get that face done."

06:10.324 --> 06:12.224
We have to, like, bang these out

06:12.259 --> 06:13.959
and get you guys
into the molding room.

06:13.994 --> 06:16.495
I want my team
to continue with the aliens

06:16.530 --> 06:19.464
as much as possible while
Gregory begins on the monkey.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.967
- The monkey face.
- Yeah.

06:21.969 --> 06:24.703
I have my own special effects
makeup shop in North Carolina,

06:24.738 --> 06:27.739
and so I feel comfortable
taking a leadership role.

06:27.775 --> 06:30.742
So I volunteered to sculpt
the face for the monkey.

06:30.778 --> 06:33.145
I'm a little concerned
about having a squirrel monkey

06:33.180 --> 06:36.398
and changing it into a menacing,
tyrannical leader,

06:36.433 --> 06:38.950
because it's sculpting something
mean from something cute.

06:38.986 --> 06:40.585
That can be a little difficult.

06:40.621 --> 06:41.870
Sometimes, big works,

06:41.905 --> 06:43.839
and then other times,
it can bite you in the anus.

06:43.891 --> 06:45.424
[Chuckles]

06:48.395 --> 06:50.929
I spent ten years
in the Air National Guard,

06:50.964 --> 06:52.581
but I've always had a passion
for doing effects.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.649
I feel like this is my chance
to prove myself,

06:54.685 --> 06:57.169
so I volunteered
to sculpt the monkey face.

06:57.204 --> 06:59.838
It's going to be the only
prosthetic on this character,

06:59.873 --> 07:01.957
and it's Rick Baker
that is judging it.

07:02.009 --> 07:03.875
This is a big responsibility.

07:03.911 --> 07:05.477
We got lots to do.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.845
Okay, Regina.

07:06.897 --> 07:07.979
What's your goal?

07:08.015 --> 07:10.148
Another half an hour?

07:10.184 --> 07:12.067
I'm a little worried
about Regina right now,

07:12.119 --> 07:14.953
because she's spending a lot
of time on the arachnid's face.

07:14.988 --> 07:16.588
I think
the sculpt's looking great,

07:16.590 --> 07:18.306
but it's just taking
a long time.

07:18.342 --> 07:20.859
I just have to get her
moving a little bit quicker.

07:23.497 --> 07:24.963
Hi, everybody.

07:24.965 --> 07:26.198
- I'm back!
- Hello. - Hi.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.834
This is our mandrill king,

07:28.869 --> 07:31.403
and he's really an overlord
for this place.

07:31.438 --> 07:32.838
What are you gonna do
with the fur?

07:32.873 --> 07:36.374
We're gonna use
four-way stretch fabric fur,

07:36.410 --> 07:39.444
so that way, it actually
moves real organically.

07:39.446 --> 07:41.613
Are you gonna have
to hand lay anything?

07:41.615 --> 07:43.315
- Certain bits.
- I would hand lay the edges.

07:43.317 --> 07:44.883
And again,
your paint structure...

07:44.918 --> 07:47.419
paint colors underneath, if you
break them up a little bit,

07:47.454 --> 07:49.254
that actually shows
through your hand laying.

07:49.289 --> 07:50.388
Mm-hmm.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.591
So for this creature,

07:52.626 --> 07:54.993
we decided
to scrap the old idea.

07:55.028 --> 07:56.261
Good idea.

07:56.313 --> 07:57.846
Yesterday,
when Mr. Westmore came in,

07:57.881 --> 08:01.233
he didn't like my face sculpture
for the high intelligence alien,

08:01.285 --> 08:03.401
so I tore that off
and started over.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.620
We're playing with more organic
shapes and everything.

08:05.656 --> 08:07.072
Mm-hmm.
I think it's great.

08:07.107 --> 08:08.206
You've done a great job.

08:08.242 --> 08:09.174
Let's see the next one.

08:09.226 --> 08:10.876
This is your little bit
of a twist?

08:10.911 --> 08:12.210
Just started on the monkey.

08:12.246 --> 08:13.311
She's aged.

08:13.347 --> 08:14.946
She's stern.

08:14.982 --> 08:16.364
In the face here too, you know,

08:16.400 --> 08:18.650
you can give yourself
a little bit more power here.

08:18.702 --> 08:21.937
Actually, just getting
possibly more of a muzzle,

08:21.989 --> 08:22.954
less human.

08:22.990 --> 08:25.023
- So bring it out further?
- Yeah.

08:25.058 --> 08:26.808
We wanted to keep the pattern
of the fur,

08:26.860 --> 08:28.894
'cause he does have such
a cute face.

08:28.929 --> 08:29.961
We wanted to make, like,

08:29.997 --> 08:31.897
the widow's peak
on the fur to, like,

08:31.932 --> 08:34.499
help give him
more of a menacing look.

08:34.534 --> 08:39.169
Are you actually gonna do
fur on the face too like this,

08:39.206 --> 08:40.455
or are you gonna be painting?

08:40.490 --> 08:42.874
I'm gonna ventilate
hair pieces for it.

08:42.909 --> 08:44.009
How long will that take you?

08:44.061 --> 08:45.560
Maybe like an hour an half,
two hours.

08:45.596 --> 08:46.578
What?

08:46.613 --> 08:47.612
Took me six hours to do

08:47.648 --> 08:49.681
my first and last mustache.

08:49.716 --> 08:52.150
Nobody ever wore it, thank God.

08:52.152 --> 08:53.368
I'm gonna say good-bye.

08:53.403 --> 08:54.986
Everything's really
looking great.

08:55.022 --> 08:57.155
You've really stepped up.
Good luck.

08:57.190 --> 08:58.757
- We'll see you later.
Both: - Thank you.

09:03.797 --> 09:06.698
I know that I need
to get this alien molded,

09:06.733 --> 09:09.918
so I go back into the mold room,
and I get to work.

09:09.953 --> 09:11.503
Are you just doing
the splash coat?

09:11.538 --> 09:12.504
Yeah.

09:12.539 --> 09:14.122
I'm mixing a bunch of plaster,

09:14.157 --> 09:16.841
but I'm rushing it,
so I made it a little too thick,

09:16.877 --> 09:18.310
and it's almost setting.

09:18.345 --> 09:21.613
I'm worried that I won't be able
to stick burlap into it,

09:21.648 --> 09:25.050
which means when it's time
to open it, it's going to crack.

09:25.085 --> 09:26.418
Are you putting burlap in it?

09:26.453 --> 09:28.119
No, not yet,
'cause it's setting too fast.

09:28.171 --> 09:29.704
It does...
That's not an option.

09:29.756 --> 09:32.324
Kelly is making
some big mistakes right now,

09:32.326 --> 09:34.626
so I can't really
be Mr. Nice Guy.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.645
It needs three layers of burlap.

09:36.697 --> 09:40.065
You don't have enough plaster
or bandage to even do the job.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.801
If I mess up my mold,
then everything's ruined.

09:42.836 --> 09:44.953
Start cutting burlap.
Or you don't have to.

09:44.988 --> 09:46.071
I don't give a shit.

09:46.073 --> 09:48.673
Don't be giving me attitude.

09:53.752 --> 09:55.085
Are you putting burlap in it?

09:55.120 --> 09:56.803
No, not yet,
'cause it's setting too fast.

09:56.838 --> 09:58.088
It does...
That's not an option.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.422
[Groans]

09:59.424 --> 10:01.357
It's day two of our first
spotlight challenge.

10:01.410 --> 10:05.061
I'm making my mold
for my alien warrior face,

10:05.097 --> 10:08.064
and I'm rushing it,
so I made it a little too thick.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.166
Start cutting burlap.
Or you don't have to.

10:10.168 --> 10:11.167
I don't give a shit.

10:11.169 --> 10:12.252
I remind myself,

10:12.304 --> 10:13.420
"It's still gonna work.

10:13.472 --> 10:15.472
I just need to add
another coat."

10:15.507 --> 10:17.507
Don't be giving me attitude.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.409
It's gonna be okay, Kelly.
It's gonna be okay.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.319
All right, guys, good luck.

10:29.371 --> 10:31.187
Have fun.

10:31.223 --> 10:32.555
It's time
for us coaches to leave.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.057
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you, sir.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.159
My biggest concern
is Gregory's facial sculpt

10:36.194 --> 10:39.429
for the monkey, but overall,
I think they're in a good place.

10:39.464 --> 10:43.249
- We'll see you, guys.
- Bye.

10:43.285 --> 10:44.918
- Make sure it doesn't tip towards me.
- Oh, yeah.

10:44.953 --> 10:47.120
My team is molding
four or five different pieces

10:47.172 --> 10:48.938
for our two aliens.

10:48.974 --> 10:51.074
I know that I'm a fast molder,

10:51.109 --> 10:53.376
so even though I'm still
sculpting the monkey face,

10:53.411 --> 10:54.944
I agree to take the lead.

11:00.552 --> 11:03.419
Everybody's in the mold room
at the same time.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.790
The clock is ticking,
and there's clay everywhere.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.858
It's pandemonium.

11:08.910 --> 11:10.693
Nobody wants to fall
behind schedule,

11:10.729 --> 11:12.512
'cause it's Rick Baker.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.769
- Hey, everybody, time's up.
- Whoo.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.172
It's the end of the day,
and I'm a little worried.

11:22.207 --> 11:23.339
All of our molds are done,

11:23.375 --> 11:25.742
but I'm behind on the face
for the monkey,

11:25.777 --> 11:28.111
and I know the face can either
make or break a makeup.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.346
So I'm not feeling
really confident

11:30.382 --> 11:31.614
at this particular time.

11:37.038 --> 11:38.888
We are all exhausted,

11:38.924 --> 11:40.623
and we come into the house,

11:40.659 --> 11:42.625
and we just kind of collapse.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.528
And then we hear a knock
at the door.

11:45.564 --> 11:48.097
- Hello.
- Hey.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.500
- How you guys doing?
Both: - How are you guys?

11:50.535 --> 11:52.702
We're just here to hang out.
A little barbecue.

11:52.704 --> 11:54.370
All right.

11:56.429 --> 11:57.423
How is it going?

11:57.424 --> 11:59.329
I get to sit down,
hang out with my team,

11:59.330 --> 12:01.415
and I'm getting to
know these guys now, you know.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.439
And that's important.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.577
There's a lot on the line,

12:03.578 --> 12:06.916
but it's also like one of the best
opportunities of your life.

12:06.917 --> 12:09.381
Me being a father of three,
I know you are a father,

12:09.382 --> 12:12.162
you are a father,
I wonder how hard was it for you

12:12.163 --> 12:14.263
to cope with being away
from your kids and your family.

12:14.264 --> 12:16.456
You can use them as motivation,

12:16.491 --> 12:18.061
"What would they want
to see me do right now?".

12:18.096 --> 12:20.230
It's nice to sit down with
Rayce and talk about family,

12:20.232 --> 12:21.931
because I know
he left his family behind.

12:21.967 --> 12:25.635
I left my family behind.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.303
Everything is flaming up
back there...

12:27.339 --> 12:28.588
[Laughs]

12:28.623 --> 12:31.207
That's not a phrase
you hear every day.

12:31.243 --> 12:34.844
It's really nice to hang out
with Laura outside of the lab

12:34.880 --> 12:38.548
and get to know
more about her as well.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.083
What's everybody's
favorite movie?

12:40.118 --> 12:42.235
That's like you're choosing
your favorite children.

12:42.287 --> 12:43.486
<i>- The Thing.
- The Thing?</i>

12:43.538 --> 12:44.871
<i>- Legend.</i>
- That's... Ah,<i> Legend.</i>

12:44.906 --> 12:46.873
That's one of the movies
that screwed me up as a kid.

12:46.908 --> 12:47.874
I can't count...

12:47.909 --> 12:50.076
Made me get into this field.

12:50.128 --> 12:52.262
It's great, especially
in a competition like this,

12:52.314 --> 12:53.963
to just get your mind
off of things...

12:53.999 --> 12:56.332
just to kind of step away
from the stress a little bit

12:56.334 --> 12:59.903
and try to come fresh
the next day.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.872
[Laughter]

13:10.465 --> 13:12.348
- Yeah.
- [Excitedly jabbering]

13:12.384 --> 13:14.017
Whoo-whoo!

13:14.052 --> 13:15.535
Hi.

13:15.570 --> 13:18.922
It's day three
of our alien-monkey challenge,

13:18.957 --> 13:21.357
and we have ten hours
in the lab today.

13:21.359 --> 13:23.259
So much.

13:23.295 --> 13:27.196
What we've got to do is open
the molds for our two aliens,

13:27.232 --> 13:29.198
clean them out,

13:29.234 --> 13:32.001
finish the monkey,
all our fabrication...

13:32.037 --> 13:33.036
there's a lot of work to do.

13:36.391 --> 13:37.807
This is so awesome.

13:37.842 --> 13:39.609
I run to my station,
look at the foam pieces...

13:39.644 --> 13:40.693
Look at them edges.

13:40.729 --> 13:42.512
"What edges?" I know.

13:42.547 --> 13:43.579
The foam's looking good.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.515
We're in a good spot, and I know

13:45.550 --> 13:47.417
that we can get these two aliens

13:47.452 --> 13:48.584
prepainted today.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.653
So we're going with a taupe,
right?

13:50.705 --> 13:53.756
Mm-hmm.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.794
I'm actually
gonna make a whole suit.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.962
Okay.

13:58.997 --> 14:01.264
I still have so much
to do for the arachnid,

14:01.299 --> 14:04.517
so I take L200 foam
and make plate armor to wear.

14:04.569 --> 14:06.336
It's like the underbelly
of a scorpion.

14:06.371 --> 14:07.403
It really looks good.

14:07.439 --> 14:10.556
It's really coming
together nicely.

14:10.608 --> 14:11.975
How much longer you think
you got on this guy?

14:12.010 --> 14:13.493
Just a few little touch-ups
here and there.

14:13.528 --> 14:15.211
I'm gonna look it over and make
sure everything's sealed up.

14:15.246 --> 14:16.312
Thanks, Rob.

14:20.385 --> 14:23.603
So, Alan and Daniel
cast Alan's hands in alginate

14:23.655 --> 14:25.621
so we can use them
as a positive.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.390
Okay.

14:27.425 --> 14:29.492
We get them pulled
out of the alginate,

14:29.527 --> 14:30.893
and I start sculpting hands

14:30.945 --> 14:33.496
that will be gloves
for this alien creature.

14:33.531 --> 14:34.964
Here, let me give you a hand.

14:39.771 --> 14:42.472
I volunteered to make
the crown for the monkey,

14:42.507 --> 14:46.309
but I've never really
fabricated anything.

14:46.311 --> 14:49.946
I start drawing out
my interpretation of this crown

14:49.981 --> 14:52.048
onto the foam.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.017
I get a dremel to the top of it

14:54.052 --> 14:57.653
and start moving it around
and getting chunks out of it.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.655
I'm ecstatic
about how this is turning out.

14:59.657 --> 15:01.157
I'm stoked.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.026
I like this.

15:08.099 --> 15:11.034
There you go.

15:11.069 --> 15:12.485
How's it going?

15:12.520 --> 15:14.237
Ah, we doing good.

15:14.272 --> 15:16.773
I look at Gregory's
facial sculpt for the monkey,

15:16.775 --> 15:18.891
and it's look...

15:18.943 --> 15:20.710
it needs, um...

15:20.745 --> 15:22.061
a lot of work.

15:22.097 --> 15:24.013
I feel like you lose
the monkey aspect of it

15:24.065 --> 15:25.798
if you make it too mangled.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.250
I wouldn't do anything
to the nose,

15:27.285 --> 15:28.451
and if you're gonna do accents,

15:28.486 --> 15:31.721
just on the chin
and on the eye and...

15:31.773 --> 15:32.972
You got to make sure

15:33.024 --> 15:36.359
anatomy-wise the creature
looks like a monkey.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.161
I'm extremely worried.

15:38.196 --> 15:40.313
The face is so crucial.

15:40.348 --> 15:43.332
It has to be just right.

15:43.334 --> 15:45.701
Well, Laura does not like it,
and that's a bad feeling.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.236
I don't want to go home
for this makeup,

15:47.272 --> 15:48.704
but I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

15:52.874 --> 15:54.207
You got to make sure

15:54.242 --> 15:59.929
anatomy-wise that the creature
looks like a monkey.

15:59.981 --> 16:01.948
It's day three
of the alien challenge,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.884
and Laura says my face sculpt
doesn't look like a monkey.

16:04.919 --> 16:08.604
Usually, wrinkles wouldn't
flow like that around eyes.

16:08.656 --> 16:10.790
They typically go like that.

16:10.825 --> 16:13.659
I'm just telling him how crucial
it is that the anatomy

16:13.695 --> 16:16.195
is perfect, and I don't think
he's really getting it,

16:16.231 --> 16:18.030
but I guess we'll have
to wait and see.

16:22.237 --> 16:23.903
It's almost time
for the coaches to leave,

16:23.938 --> 16:25.238
so I meet with my team

16:25.290 --> 16:26.906
to make sure
that we're all getting things

16:26.958 --> 16:28.441
ready for application day.

16:28.476 --> 16:30.776
Do whatever it takes so that
tomorrow we're just applying

16:30.812 --> 16:32.245
and painting, okay?

16:32.280 --> 16:33.779
And we know our colors
and everything.

16:33.815 --> 16:35.214
If we do that,
then we'll be set.

16:35.216 --> 16:36.782
Okay? You're doing awesome.

16:36.818 --> 16:38.584
If my team can stay on schedule,

16:38.620 --> 16:39.869
then I think
we're gonna be okay.

16:39.921 --> 16:41.587
- Bye, guys. Have fun.
- Bye.

16:41.623 --> 16:45.241
- Bye.
- Wow, it's bright out here.

16:45.276 --> 16:46.926
So to prepare the hair
for the monkey,

16:46.961 --> 16:50.396
I grab synthetic hair,
yak hair, scrap wig hair,

16:50.431 --> 16:54.634
and then I just use the hackle
and start mixing.

16:54.669 --> 16:57.837
I'm gonna ventilate hair pieces
for our character.

16:57.872 --> 16:59.639
So you're gonna hand tie
each and every hair?

16:59.674 --> 17:00.640
Yep.

17:00.675 --> 17:01.807
- Or bunch of hairs?
- Mm-hmm.

17:01.843 --> 17:04.676
Ventilating hair is
when you hand tie hair

17:04.712 --> 17:06.194
into this piece of lace.

17:06.231 --> 17:09.949
It's one of the most realistic
techniques to make hair.

17:09.983 --> 17:11.117
This is so tedious.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.594
♪♪♪

17:17.842 --> 17:19.759
We have ten minutes left,

17:19.794 --> 17:23.829
and I still need
to open the hand molds.

17:23.865 --> 17:26.766
The top comes off just fine,
and I start pulling clay.

17:31.707 --> 17:34.607
And I notice there's no fingers
on them.

17:34.659 --> 17:38.027
So now I've got two hands,
all missing fingers,

17:38.079 --> 17:40.346
and we've only got
a couple minutes left.

17:40.348 --> 17:42.377
I'm not running these things
in foam today.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.740
I'm gonna have to jam them together
with plumber's epoxy and some sticks,

17:46.829 --> 17:49.209
and run polyfoam tomorrow.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.502
Okay, that's time, guys!

17:51.503 --> 17:53.752
These hands are one
of the only things that I sculpted,

17:53.753 --> 17:57.060
so if I can't run it tomorrow,
I could go home before anyone

17:57.147 --> 17:58.362
gets to see what I can create.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.675
- Ooh, wow, that's pretty.
- It's application day.

18:09.711 --> 18:12.495
We have four hours in the lab,
one hour at last look.

18:12.530 --> 18:15.414
We walk into the lab,
and I find my arachnid cowl,

18:15.450 --> 18:16.565
and it's kind of rough.

18:16.618 --> 18:18.784
That one's all jacked up.

18:18.820 --> 18:21.904
I have no time for this,

18:21.940 --> 18:25.858
but now have to fix this thing.

18:25.893 --> 18:27.360
For the first challenge,

18:27.395 --> 18:30.796
to have to experience
fixing a cowl like this...

18:30.832 --> 18:32.999
Logan's going
to learn a lot right now.

18:39.657 --> 18:42.575
First thing I have to do
is get these alien hands made.

18:42.610 --> 18:44.844
I don't have time
to grind down the hands,

18:44.879 --> 18:46.212
but I got to make them fit.

18:46.247 --> 18:49.148
And I'm worried
that this isn't gonna work.

18:52.954 --> 18:56.088
- Hello.
- Good morning.

18:56.124 --> 18:57.690
Hi.

18:57.691 --> 18:58.518
I'm Jamie.

19:01.462 --> 19:03.112
The plan of attack
is that Darla and Emily

19:03.164 --> 19:05.314
are handling the younger alien,

19:05.350 --> 19:09.201
Stephanie and Julian
are handling the older alien,

19:09.237 --> 19:11.470
and Gregory
is handling the monkey.

19:11.506 --> 19:12.972
And then Emily
will apply the hair.

19:20.648 --> 19:23.182
Daniel is putting on the cowl

19:23.184 --> 19:25.851
while I'm taking the face
and blending that,

19:25.887 --> 19:29.055
but I'm noticing
it doesn't fit the model properly.

19:29.107 --> 19:31.057
I'm having a little issue
with the chin.

19:31.059 --> 19:33.559
I don't think it's gonna fit,
because this is pretty high up.

19:33.611 --> 19:36.545
I'm really frustrated, because
I'm spending so much time

19:36.581 --> 19:37.947
trying to get it on my model.

19:37.982 --> 19:39.865
- Seem good?
- Yeah.

19:39.901 --> 19:41.000
Okay.

19:41.035 --> 19:42.968
You guys doing all right?

19:43.021 --> 19:45.538
I'd give us a four
out of ten right now.

19:45.540 --> 19:49.175
Having a lot of fixing to do
creates this insane pressure

19:49.177 --> 19:50.976
for every one
of my team members,

19:51.012 --> 19:52.011
but they got to move.

19:52.063 --> 19:54.013
They got to get going.

19:54.048 --> 19:55.348
As important as this is,

19:55.383 --> 19:57.249
it's not as important
as getting those faces on.

19:57.285 --> 19:58.284
Can I have you help Anthony?

19:58.336 --> 19:59.702
And Adam,
can I have you help Logan?

19:59.754 --> 20:00.953
No problem.

20:01.005 --> 20:02.338
How long do you think
this'll take you guys?

20:02.373 --> 20:03.422
Keep working
as I'm talking to you,

20:03.458 --> 20:04.473
but I'm worried about time.

20:04.509 --> 20:06.292
Check that seam around the head.

20:06.327 --> 20:08.027
There's also this section
up here.

20:08.062 --> 20:11.597
I like it.

20:11.632 --> 20:14.133
My biggest concern
for my team for application day

20:14.168 --> 20:15.267
is the paint job.

20:15.303 --> 20:17.870
The goal is for it
to be so translucent

20:17.922 --> 20:19.872
that it just layers up
really nice.

20:19.874 --> 20:21.974
The painting is very important
in this competition.

20:22.009 --> 20:25.010
Since the coaches won't be
with their teams in last looks,

20:25.063 --> 20:27.279
I'm hoping to guide them
through the paint jobs

20:27.315 --> 20:28.981
so that they can get
these things finished.

20:29.016 --> 20:31.217
Keep it a little more cohesive
so it's... if you look here.

20:31.252 --> 20:33.169
You're gonna get
a nice breakup of color.

20:36.357 --> 20:39.058
This could be, like, broken up
a little bit more. Here.

20:39.093 --> 20:41.160
The pressure's on now,
because there's not much time

20:41.212 --> 20:45.798
left on the clock, and I'm the
only one working on the monkey.

20:45.833 --> 20:47.700
Painting is taking
a lot more time

20:47.735 --> 20:49.985
than I thought it would.

20:50.021 --> 20:51.437
This is stressing me out a lot,

20:51.489 --> 20:53.222
because it's just...
it's a mess.

20:53.274 --> 20:55.524
You do only have 44 minutes
though.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.710
If you need to finish the face,

20:57.745 --> 20:59.078
I'll help you out a little bit.

20:59.113 --> 21:00.963
You... put your hand down.

21:01.015 --> 21:04.583
There you go.

21:04.585 --> 21:05.584
This is the brown.

21:05.636 --> 21:07.503
This is the dark brown,
like the base.

21:07.555 --> 21:09.221
And then
it goes up into this yellow.

21:09.257 --> 21:11.257
Those are to set out
the basic shapes and forms.

21:11.292 --> 21:13.292
I've been behind all morning
working on this cowl,

21:13.294 --> 21:15.277
and then I realized
that we're actually caught up.

21:15.313 --> 21:16.729
Are we gonna
paint the eyeballs too?

21:16.781 --> 21:17.780
Yes.

21:17.815 --> 21:20.199
And I think
it looks pretty good.

21:24.222 --> 21:25.938
15 minutes, everybody.

21:33.498 --> 21:35.514
I spent
all morning making hands,

21:35.550 --> 21:39.285
and they aren't looking good.

21:39.287 --> 21:40.503
Time.

21:40.555 --> 21:42.221
I'm potentially the odd man out,

21:42.256 --> 21:46.959
because I don't have anything
to really attach my name to.

21:46.994 --> 21:48.294
So I might be going home
tonight.

21:53.751 --> 21:55.684
Other side.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.020
Okay.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.055
The first thing we want to do
is attack those ears.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.273
We have a hour at last looks.

22:01.309 --> 22:02.775
It is crazy in here.

22:02.810 --> 22:04.894
I'm trying to put
the final touches on this one.

22:04.929 --> 22:06.912
Okay, Emily, you really
need to get on the hair work.

22:06.964 --> 22:08.531
Just let them do the painting.

22:08.566 --> 22:11.700
We have a lot to do.

22:11.736 --> 22:13.969
I'm popping in teeth.
I'm popping in eyes.

22:13.971 --> 22:15.137
Give me a snarl.

22:15.189 --> 22:17.423
I realize
that I don't have time to do

22:17.458 --> 22:20.543
what I originally
wanted to do with my paint job.

22:20.578 --> 22:21.810
Teeth?

22:21.846 --> 22:23.479
Your plastic thing's
coming out of them.

22:23.514 --> 22:24.547
- Really?
- In all honesty,

22:24.582 --> 22:26.181
it's probably not gonna stick.

22:26.217 --> 22:27.917
This creature
needs to have nasty fangs.

22:27.952 --> 22:30.002
It don't need to have nice
pearly whites.

22:30.037 --> 22:33.772
So we tell the model,
"Don't show your teeth."

22:33.808 --> 22:38.627
You're almost done looking
like the coolest thing ever.

22:38.663 --> 22:40.296
Ten minutes.

22:40.331 --> 22:42.414
Wiggle your fingers
inside those little holes.

22:42.466 --> 22:43.999
The hands aren't even
on the models yet.

22:44.035 --> 22:45.167
They're ripping up the sides,

22:45.202 --> 22:46.652
and they're not holding
in place.

22:46.704 --> 22:48.070
You got bobby pins?

22:48.122 --> 22:50.456
So I grab burlap rolls, and
I start wrapping them around.

22:50.491 --> 22:52.841
Just trying to make sure
they look like hands

22:52.893 --> 22:54.743
and not some messed up gloves.

22:57.548 --> 23:00.950
That's time, everyone.

23:00.985 --> 23:03.385
Rick Baker
is gonna be like, "What on Earth

23:03.421 --> 23:04.954
is on this guy's face?"

23:04.989 --> 23:06.689
The monkey's
in a really bad position,

23:06.724 --> 23:08.958
and the more and more I look at
it, it just looks like a mess.

23:09.010 --> 23:09.992
I can't.

23:10.027 --> 23:11.076
It's really disappointing,

23:11.112 --> 23:12.411
and I'm just thinking,

23:12.446 --> 23:14.480
"This is what Rick Baker's
gonna remember me for."

23:27.511 --> 23:31.347
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

23:31.399 --> 23:34.917
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

23:34.952 --> 23:36.885
But before we see
your creations,

23:36.921 --> 23:39.521
let me introduce you
to our judges.

23:39.523 --> 23:42.107
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

23:42.159 --> 23:43.559
Mr. Glenn Hetrick.

23:43.594 --> 23:45.394
- Good evening.
- Hey.

23:45.429 --> 23:47.930
Three-time Academy Award
winning makeup artist

23:47.982 --> 23:48.964
Ms. Ve Neill.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.599
Hello again, everyone.

23:50.635 --> 23:51.917
- Hey, Ve.
- Hey.

23:51.969 --> 23:54.687
Creature and concept design
expert Neville Page.

23:54.739 --> 23:56.505
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey, Neville.

23:56.540 --> 23:58.540
And of course, we are
very lucky to have

23:58.576 --> 24:03.646
seven-time Academy Award winning
makeup artist Rick Baker.

24:03.681 --> 24:07.282
Hi, guys.

24:07.284 --> 24:08.651
Rick Baker's my idol.

24:08.686 --> 24:10.085
I still can't believe he's here.

24:10.121 --> 24:11.870
This is just an experience
of a lifetime

24:11.906 --> 24:14.523
that I would never think
I'd ever get in a million years.

24:14.558 --> 24:16.258
All right, well, you ready
to take a look at some makeups?

24:16.293 --> 24:18.794
- I'm ready.
- Okay, let's do this.

24:18.829 --> 24:22.014
Your first spotlight challenge
was to create two aliens

24:22.066 --> 24:25.834
that emerged from a unique
extraterrestrial crash site.

24:25.870 --> 24:28.337
Then you had to create
a primate ruler of the planet

24:28.372 --> 24:30.239
your aliens had crashed on.

24:30.274 --> 24:32.641
Team Anthony, you're first.

24:35.413 --> 24:37.346
When my team's characters
walk out on stage,

24:37.348 --> 24:38.731
I really don't know
what to expect.

24:38.766 --> 24:40.399
I'm just excited
to see what they were able

24:40.434 --> 24:41.784
to pull together in my absence.

24:58.035 --> 24:59.351
I'm really proud of my team.

24:59.403 --> 25:01.103
The monkey looks very powerful
up there.

25:01.138 --> 25:02.404
But at the same time, you know,

25:02.440 --> 25:05.074
I do feel that there's
still more work to do.

25:15.986 --> 25:17.286
I'm feeling kind of disappointed

25:17.321 --> 25:18.887
with our two aliens.

25:18.923 --> 25:21.323
Now it's time to,
you know, pay the piper.

25:32.970 --> 25:35.104
I'm really happy
with the mandrill,

25:35.106 --> 25:37.740
but I am not sure
about the other aliens.

25:37.775 --> 25:39.057
So we'll see what happens.

25:57.561 --> 25:59.161
I'm really proud of the team
right now,

25:59.196 --> 26:00.629
and I'm really happy

26:00.664 --> 26:02.664
with the work
they did in that last hour.

26:15.713 --> 26:18.046
Our pieces look like they
stepped out of another world.

26:18.048 --> 26:19.348
They're fantastic.

26:19.383 --> 26:20.716
We did have some setbacks,

26:20.751 --> 26:22.484
but we pulled together
as a team,

26:22.520 --> 26:23.685
and we made it happen.

26:36.867 --> 26:39.284
I love the anatomy
of the monkey.

26:39.336 --> 26:43.238
This definitely looks like
a regal, queen-like character.

27:02.059 --> 27:04.593
I'm a little nervous, 'cause
I'm seeing a few things that,

27:04.628 --> 27:07.362
in the past,
the judges have not liked.

27:07.398 --> 27:09.431
But overall,
I'm still extremely proud.

27:22.947 --> 27:24.847
My alien is definitely
what I wanted.

27:24.882 --> 27:26.548
I'm looking at the judges,
and I'm like,

27:26.584 --> 27:28.116
"It looks great, right?
Right?"

27:42.032 --> 27:45.167
I'm just at awe
at how real they look.

27:45.169 --> 27:46.535
I love the aliens,

27:46.570 --> 27:48.503
but I'm a little concerned
about the monkey.

27:53.544 --> 27:55.077
All right, judges,
why don't you take

27:55.079 --> 27:56.545
a closer look
at tonight's makeups.

28:04.321 --> 28:05.587
Got some problems going on

28:05.589 --> 28:07.089
with the mouth there,
don't they?

28:07.124 --> 28:09.274
Can you do anything
with your brows at all?

28:09.326 --> 28:11.410
No.
Thank you.

28:14.315 --> 28:18.350
They made a massive investment
in fabricating wardrobe

28:18.402 --> 28:19.801
to the detriment of the sculpt.

28:19.853 --> 28:22.471
I think that they should've
spent more time on his head.

28:22.473 --> 28:24.373
I don't think this read well
from a distance.

28:24.425 --> 28:27.009
- Yeah.
- This is beyond intense.

28:27.044 --> 28:30.812
We've got Rick Baker, you know,
face-to-face with our aliens,

28:30.848 --> 28:33.899
and I am not happy
with this paint job at all.

28:33.934 --> 28:36.068
This paint looks very matte
compared to the other one.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.252
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

28:37.288 --> 28:38.487
I am freaking out.

28:42.126 --> 28:43.625
Hey,<i>Face Off</i> fans.

28:43.661 --> 28:45.961
When you watch <i> Face Off,</i>
Tweet off.

28:45.996 --> 28:48.130
Tell us how you feel
about your favorite artist

28:48.132 --> 28:49.865
using #FaceOff.

28:53.502 --> 28:54.568
This paint looks very matte

28:54.603 --> 28:55.569
compared to the other one.

28:55.571 --> 28:56.570
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

28:56.572 --> 28:58.371
This is beyond intense.

28:58.373 --> 29:01.608
I am not happy
with this paint job at all,

29:01.643 --> 29:03.843
and I am freaking out.

29:03.896 --> 29:05.745
This is all pretty
great-looking.

29:05.781 --> 29:07.914
One thing that's really
that's really working on this

29:07.950 --> 29:10.650
though is just
the general massing of the head.

29:10.686 --> 29:12.552
Yeah, no,
I think the whole thing

29:12.588 --> 29:15.388
works pretty well together.

29:15.424 --> 29:17.691
Someone made an attempt
to address the entire character.

29:17.726 --> 29:19.159
What happens
if you push your tongue

29:19.161 --> 29:21.161
against your upper lip like,
"t-t-t-t-t"?

29:21.213 --> 29:22.195
Yeah, that's cool.

29:22.231 --> 29:23.463
Ew, creepy.

29:23.498 --> 29:24.497
All right, thank you.

29:28.203 --> 29:30.070
This looks like it's a mistake.

29:30.122 --> 29:31.738
It looks like it's on crooked,
doesn't it?

29:31.790 --> 29:33.873
- Yeah, definitely.
- Thank you.

29:37.479 --> 29:41.248
- It's actually pretty darn cute.
- Yeah, I like this.

29:41.283 --> 29:42.232
This is pretty great.

29:42.284 --> 29:43.483
This all works really well,

29:43.535 --> 29:45.252
considering it's all one piece.

29:45.287 --> 29:47.420
Yeah.

29:47.456 --> 29:49.990
Wow,
there is some super cool color

29:50.042 --> 29:53.593
going on that I did not see
from far away.

29:53.629 --> 29:56.162
- Try to smile.
- That's even freakier.

29:56.164 --> 29:57.664
- [Laughs]
- Yeah, it is.

29:57.716 --> 30:01.034
Thank you.

30:01.069 --> 30:03.386
Can you tilt your head
all the way down?

30:03.438 --> 30:05.605
I like the transition.
I think it's pretty cool.

30:05.657 --> 30:06.840
Mm-hmm.

30:06.875 --> 30:08.375
I've never seen that shape
before.

30:08.410 --> 30:10.660
Yeah, and the forms
work better close up,

30:10.712 --> 30:14.547
which is weird, you know?

30:14.583 --> 30:16.349
He's beat up, this guy.

30:16.351 --> 30:18.518
The lip is so deep in here

30:18.570 --> 30:21.187
that the profile
doesn't feel like a primate.

30:21.223 --> 30:22.439
Okay, thank you.

30:27.562 --> 30:29.796
Okay, the judges
have checked out your creations

30:29.831 --> 30:33.233
but now would like to talk
to their top and bottom looks.

30:33.268 --> 30:36.803
Logan, Regina, Rob, and Adam
from Team Rayce,

30:36.838 --> 30:38.371
we're gonna start with you.

30:44.780 --> 30:46.579
Tell us your character's
backstory

30:46.615 --> 30:49.215
and how it fits into
your cryochamber crash scene.

30:49.251 --> 30:51.151
This is the native creature.

30:51.186 --> 30:54.254
We opted to go
with an insect-like alien.

30:54.289 --> 30:56.222
Sort of like
the desert environment.

30:56.258 --> 31:00.710
I think this is extremely
well-managed piece of work.

31:00.746 --> 31:02.095
Thanks very much.

31:02.147 --> 31:05.231
I'm thrilled that you chose
to predicate your design

31:05.267 --> 31:06.666
on an insect.

31:06.702 --> 31:09.602
I think that's very right
thinking in alien design, so...

31:09.638 --> 31:11.004
You guys
really brought it to life.

31:11.039 --> 31:12.422
Both: - Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

31:12.474 --> 31:13.506
Who did what?

31:13.542 --> 31:15.241
I sculpted and painted the cowl.

31:15.277 --> 31:16.843
I sculpted the face.

31:16.878 --> 31:18.345
I developed the overall concept.

31:18.347 --> 31:19.979
I fabricated the arms,

31:20.015 --> 31:21.815
chest piece, hands,
and then the weapon.

31:21.850 --> 31:24.517
I think you did a great job
with your attention to detail.

31:24.553 --> 31:25.719
You've put all these different

31:25.754 --> 31:27.620
little paint schemes
up on the head.

31:27.656 --> 31:29.289
You even have
those little hair things

31:29.291 --> 31:30.490
coming out of his shoulder.

31:30.492 --> 31:31.658
That is so cool.

31:31.710 --> 31:33.293
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you so much.

31:33.328 --> 31:34.861
I'm really impressed
with the sculpt.

31:34.896 --> 31:37.464
There's some really beautiful
forms happening in it.

31:37.466 --> 31:39.733
- It looks really confident.
- Thank you.

31:39.768 --> 31:41.101
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

31:41.136 --> 31:43.503
It almost looks to me
as if the body blends

31:43.538 --> 31:44.971
with the costume
a little too much.

31:45.006 --> 31:47.240
I think if some of that earth
tone went down into the chest

31:47.275 --> 31:49.376
a little bit,
it would pop a little bit more,

31:49.411 --> 31:51.444
but overall, I'm very impressed
with what you did.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.879
Both: - Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

31:52.914 --> 31:54.547
- Awesome.
- Thank you very much.

31:54.583 --> 31:55.982
You can step back.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.891
Kelly, Daniel, Alan, and Ben

32:04.926 --> 32:06.659
from Team Anthony, you're up.

32:13.368 --> 32:15.101
Would you please
describe your character

32:15.153 --> 32:16.836
and how it fits
into your crash site?

32:16.872 --> 32:20.707
Well, they come to mine gold
to power their ships.

32:20.742 --> 32:23.843
They are more technologically
advanced and more militant.

32:23.879 --> 32:25.445
I sculpted the face,

32:25.480 --> 32:27.247
Daniel sculpted the cowl,

32:27.282 --> 32:30.450
Alan did the armor,
and Ben did the hands.

32:30.485 --> 32:31.885
I got to tell you guys,

32:31.920 --> 32:35.922
I'm not really excited
about this character.

32:35.957 --> 32:39.192
I'm not real hot on the design
of him or the paint job.

32:39.227 --> 32:40.860
I don't think
that this is the character

32:40.862 --> 32:45.698
that you say is a miner
or whatever he's supposed to be.

32:45.734 --> 32:47.534
- Who made the hands?
- I made the hands.

32:47.569 --> 32:50.670
I think I would've taken those
off and just painted the hands.

32:50.672 --> 32:52.639
I think they would've
been more functional,

32:52.674 --> 32:54.874
less distracting.

32:54.910 --> 32:56.593
I do have a certain disdain

32:56.645 --> 32:58.211
for the flatness
of this sculpture.

32:58.246 --> 33:00.296
It doesn't make
anatomical sense.

33:00.332 --> 33:04.367
There's also
a severe lack of detail.

33:04.402 --> 33:05.368
Thank you, guys.

33:05.403 --> 33:07.720
If you'd please step back.

33:12.194 --> 33:14.894
All right, Stephanie,
Julian, and Gregory

33:14.930 --> 33:17.497
from Team Laura, if you
please step forward.

33:24.806 --> 33:27.023
So tell us a little bit more
about this character

33:27.058 --> 33:29.609
and how the crash site
inspired the design.

33:29.644 --> 33:33.813
The creatures are used
to a very moist climate,

33:33.849 --> 33:37.917
but since the ship dropped them
on this really dry desert sand,

33:37.953 --> 33:39.586
they're starting to crack some.

33:39.621 --> 33:41.120
I sculpted the back.

33:41.156 --> 33:42.956
I sculpted the cowl.

33:42.991 --> 33:44.824
And then I sculpted the face

33:44.860 --> 33:48.294
and painted the front
and top of the cowl.

33:48.330 --> 33:52.665
I really like a lot
about this particular character.

33:52.701 --> 33:55.301
There's some really beautiful
sculpture happening in the face.

33:55.353 --> 33:58.071
For me, when I see it
as a head-to-toe piece,

33:58.123 --> 34:01.941
the face and the cowl and
the paint work are quite lovely.

34:01.977 --> 34:03.276
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

34:03.311 --> 34:04.744
I like the paint job

34:04.746 --> 34:07.864
and the kind of abruptness of
the changes of the two colors.

34:07.916 --> 34:10.550
Overall, I think
these were very successful.

34:10.585 --> 34:11.918
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:11.953 --> 34:13.453
I think you did an amazing job,

34:13.505 --> 34:15.804
and I love
that luminescent quality.

34:15.840 --> 34:19.192
And it does really read
like an aquatic reptilian race,

34:19.244 --> 34:20.260
which is kind of neat.

34:20.295 --> 34:22.428
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:22.464 --> 34:24.464
Thank you, guys.
You can head back.

34:28.803 --> 34:31.170
All right,
Logan, Anthony, Regina,

34:31.206 --> 34:33.606
and Rob from Team Rayce,
if you'd please step forward.

34:41.650 --> 34:43.416
Please tell us
about your simian character

34:43.418 --> 34:44.583
that goes with this planet.

34:44.619 --> 34:47.085
She is an empress.

34:47.121 --> 34:48.554
She looks weathered and tired,

34:48.590 --> 34:52.458
but she's also supposed
to be strong and wise.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.960
Who did what on this character?

34:53.962 --> 34:55.061
I sculpted the face.

34:55.112 --> 34:57.363
I painted the face, the hands,

34:57.399 --> 34:59.866
and fabricated the crown.

34:59.901 --> 35:01.968
I dremeled down the teeth
and sculpted them,

35:01.970 --> 35:03.803
and I also hand laid the hair.

35:03.838 --> 35:05.772
I sculpted the chest piece,
vacuformed it,

35:05.774 --> 35:07.674
and then L200...

35:07.676 --> 35:09.943
the rest of the bottom
and the shoulder pieces.

35:09.945 --> 35:13.346
Well, I think
she's pretty damn fabulous.

35:13.398 --> 35:14.747
I even like the paint job.

35:14.783 --> 35:16.199
She does look aged.

35:16.251 --> 35:18.117
She has frailty about her.

35:18.119 --> 35:20.486
I think she's a beautiful
character, and congratulations.

35:20.522 --> 35:23.306
- Thanks very much.
- I think this works very well.

35:23.341 --> 35:24.691
I like the color choice.

35:24.726 --> 35:27.393
I like the dark hair
with the light streaks.

35:27.429 --> 35:30.563
I also did that on Michael
Jackson's were-cat monster,

35:30.599 --> 35:32.031
where I...
I'll do that very often,

35:32.067 --> 35:34.534
have white highlights
to show off certain parts.

35:34.569 --> 35:36.502
- I congratulate you.
- Huge honor. Thank you.

35:36.554 --> 35:38.037
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

35:38.039 --> 35:40.340
Little things, like the fact
that the tear duct

35:40.375 --> 35:41.941
is sculpted into the prosthetic,

35:41.993 --> 35:43.526
allowing you to transition
into the eye

35:43.578 --> 35:45.478
without having to deal
with an edge right there...

35:45.513 --> 35:49.432
great choices combined
into a very successful makeup.

35:49.467 --> 35:51.484
Thank you very much.

35:51.519 --> 35:54.304
All right, you can step back.

35:58.727 --> 36:01.027
All right, Gregory
and Emily from Team Laura,

36:01.062 --> 36:03.062
if you'd please
head to the circle.

36:08.336 --> 36:10.269
Give me a background
on this character please.

36:10.305 --> 36:12.071
He's a warrior...
like, a tyrant.

36:12.107 --> 36:14.407
He has been
through many battles.

36:14.442 --> 36:16.576
He's got battle scars
to show for it.

36:16.611 --> 36:19.679
I sculpted the face
and painted the face.

36:19.714 --> 36:24.150
I ventilated the front
of the ape's wig,

36:24.202 --> 36:25.685
and I laid the hair.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.454
Unfortunately,
I feel that it is somewhat

36:28.490 --> 36:31.124
conceptually inarticulate.

36:31.159 --> 36:34.827
I think it's suffering pretty
severely, anatomically speaking.

36:34.829 --> 36:38.748
None of it feels
like a monkey-man combination.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.667
I think this looks
like a turtle in the muzzle.

36:40.702 --> 36:43.836
It probably would've added to
him looking more like a warrior

36:43.872 --> 36:46.506
if he had
more ferocious-looking teeth.

36:46.541 --> 36:49.676
I'm afraid this makeup
doesn't work really well for me.

36:49.711 --> 36:52.912
That whole muzzle feature
feels completely wrong.

36:52.947 --> 36:55.314
Around the mouth
on most primates,

36:55.350 --> 36:57.283
it's kind of a continuous line.

36:57.285 --> 36:59.686
It doesn't sink in
and kick back out.

36:59.721 --> 37:02.822
That's my biggest beef
with this.

37:02.857 --> 37:04.757
Thank you both.
If you'd please step back.

37:11.049 --> 37:12.448
All right,
if you'd please head back

37:12.484 --> 37:14.884
to the makeup room
while the judges deliberate.

37:22.210 --> 37:25.144
All right, judges, let's start
with some of your favorites,

37:25.180 --> 37:27.880
which was Team Rayce's
arachnid alien.

37:27.916 --> 37:31.818
That was made by Logan,
Regina, Rob, and Adam.

37:31.853 --> 37:34.053
I was really impressed
with the arachnid face.

37:34.089 --> 37:37.056
They put so much energy into
all the little details on it.

37:37.092 --> 37:39.692
It just worked in
that insect type of a character.

37:39.728 --> 37:41.494
Yeah, I thought it was
nicely fabricated actually.

37:41.529 --> 37:42.695
- It was really well done.
- All right.

37:42.697 --> 37:44.497
Let's move on
to Laura's older alien.

37:44.532 --> 37:47.567
It was made by Stephanie,
Julian, and Gregory.

37:47.602 --> 37:48.601
Love the coloring.

37:48.636 --> 37:50.603
I absolutely loved
the transition

37:50.638 --> 37:51.804
between the front and the back.

37:51.856 --> 37:54.307
It looked sun-bleached
and weathered.

37:54.342 --> 37:56.292
I haven't seen
that forehead shape before.

37:56.344 --> 37:57.710
That, to me, is something.

37:57.746 --> 38:00.880
All right, let's move on
to Team Rayce's primate,

38:00.915 --> 38:03.783
which was made by Logan, Regina,
Rob, and Anthony.

38:03.818 --> 38:05.585
Yeah, I liked everything
about this makeup.

38:05.620 --> 38:07.220
I thought it was
such a cohesive design.

38:07.222 --> 38:10.323
And those Aztec-like jewels
were an interesting touch.

38:10.358 --> 38:12.024
I think the sculpture of
that face

38:12.060 --> 38:14.260
is so beautifully executed.

38:14.295 --> 38:17.697
It read easily enough as simian,
but it still had

38:17.732 --> 38:19.866
an alien characteristic
that made it unique,

38:19.901 --> 38:21.634
and it stood out
from the other characters.

38:21.669 --> 38:23.436
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

38:23.438 --> 38:25.037
that you weren't so crazy
about tonight.

38:25.073 --> 38:27.373
Team Anthony's male alien,

38:27.425 --> 38:30.943
which was done by Kelly, Alan,
Daniel, and Ben.

38:30.979 --> 38:33.279
It was just too complicated
visually.

38:33.314 --> 38:34.680
None of it makes any sense.

38:34.716 --> 38:37.183
It very much feels like someone
just kind of pushing clay around

38:37.218 --> 38:38.184
and going, "Done."

38:38.186 --> 38:39.185
That was all Kelly.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.653
What worked the least

38:40.688 --> 38:43.156
were Ben's massive mitts
for hands.

38:43.191 --> 38:45.641
I would rather see
a really good, clean makeup.

38:45.677 --> 38:47.310
Don't add too much stuff to it.

38:47.345 --> 38:48.761
And that's
exactly what they did.

38:48.797 --> 38:51.497
Al right, let's move on
to Team Laura's primate,

38:51.499 --> 38:53.466
which was done
by Gregory and Emily.

38:53.501 --> 38:54.951
For me,
that one just didn't work.

38:54.986 --> 38:57.370
Sorry to say, I think
they made a lot of mistakes.

38:57.405 --> 38:59.605
It's not a good facial
sculpture.

38:59.641 --> 39:02.575
And Gregory was at the helm
of this makeup.

39:02.610 --> 39:04.310
Yeah, he applied it
and painted it.

39:04.312 --> 39:06.145
Okay, that's everyone.

39:06.147 --> 39:07.446
Have you guys
made up your minds?

39:07.448 --> 39:09.165
- I think so.
- Mm-hmm.

39:09.217 --> 39:10.283
Then let's crown a winner.

39:23.681 --> 39:26.432
Glenn, why don't you tell us
which champion's team

39:26.484 --> 39:27.600
came out on top tonight?

39:27.602 --> 39:28.868
The top team tonight is...

39:36.065 --> 39:38.399
Glenn, why don't you tell us
which champion's team

39:38.451 --> 39:39.700
came out on top tonight?

39:39.735 --> 39:41.635
The top team tonight is...

39:45.408 --> 39:46.841
Team Rayce.

39:46.876 --> 39:49.610
Good job, guys.

39:49.645 --> 39:51.779
Your team had two of
our favorite characters tonight,

39:51.814 --> 39:54.548
both of which were
absolute standouts.

39:54.584 --> 39:56.117
- Well done.
- Thank you.

39:56.152 --> 39:57.118
Appreciate it, guys.

39:57.153 --> 39:58.619
I'm more excited about the team.

39:58.654 --> 40:00.104
There's more of a reward

40:00.156 --> 40:02.406
knowing that all five
of these guys

40:02.441 --> 40:03.908
are growing and getting better,

40:03.943 --> 40:05.326
and they learned to bring it.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.795
Congratulations, Team Rayce.

40:07.830 --> 40:09.663
Nice way to kick off
the competition.

40:09.665 --> 40:10.898
Thank you.

40:10.933 --> 40:13.067
However, we can only have
one winner.

40:13.102 --> 40:17.505
So, Glenn, who is the winner of
our first spotlight challenge?

40:17.540 --> 40:20.875
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:20.910 --> 40:25.045
Logan.

40:25.081 --> 40:27.114
The sculpture
of the primate ruler is great,

40:27.150 --> 40:29.583
but you were also responsible
for the cowl

40:29.619 --> 40:30.951
on the arachnid alien,

40:30.987 --> 40:32.853
and that's what pushed you
over the top tonight.

40:32.889 --> 40:35.439
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

40:35.491 --> 40:37.324
I'm very excited to win.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.044
It feels great to have
Rick Baker compliment my work,

40:40.096 --> 40:42.229
especially being self-taught.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.697
I'm elated right now.

40:43.733 --> 40:48.202
Unfortunately,
Kelly, Gregory, and Ben,

40:48.237 --> 40:51.805
you are on the bottom, and
one of you will be eliminated.

40:51.841 --> 40:53.474
The rest of you are safe

40:53.509 --> 40:54.942
and you can head back
to the makeup room.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.185
It's time for you guys
to step to the center circle.

41:13.029 --> 41:15.212
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

41:15.248 --> 41:17.765
Kelly, we definitely appreciate

41:17.800 --> 41:20.434
how big you went
from a design standpoint,

41:20.469 --> 41:23.904
but your flat-faced alien
just didn't work for us.

41:23.940 --> 41:28.075
Gregory, your character
lacked specific primate anatomy,

41:28.110 --> 41:31.845
and your paint job, particularly
on the muzzle, was very muddy.

41:31.881 --> 41:36.016
Ben, while we appreciated
your work on the female cowl,

41:36.052 --> 41:40.287
I'm afraid the hands for both
aliens ended up quite rough.

41:40.323 --> 41:41.822
Who is going home tonight?

41:41.857 --> 41:43.457
The person going home
tonight is...

41:47.330 --> 41:50.114
Gregory.

41:50.166 --> 41:53.867
Unfortunately, it seems that
none of the parts of your makeup

41:53.920 --> 41:55.369
quite came together,

41:55.421 --> 41:59.240
and we just weren't seeing the
concept in the final character.

41:59.275 --> 42:01.008
Gregory, I'm so sorry,

42:01.043 --> 42:02.843
but you have been eliminated.

42:02.878 --> 42:06.447
That means, Kelly and Ben,
you are both safe this week

42:06.482 --> 42:08.148
and can head back
to the makeup room.

42:11.420 --> 42:14.388
When I was 15 years old,
I went to the makeup union,

42:14.423 --> 42:16.724
and a business rep with
the union told me to give up

42:16.776 --> 42:19.026
and that I was never
gonna be a makeup artist.

42:19.061 --> 42:20.594
So they were wrong.
[Laughs]

42:20.630 --> 42:22.796
So don't let this
discourage you.

42:22.832 --> 42:23.998
Thank you, guys.

42:24.033 --> 42:26.233
It's been great
having you here with us.

42:26.269 --> 42:28.035
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

42:28.070 --> 42:29.169
and pack up your kit.

42:29.221 --> 42:30.304
Thank you.

42:30.339 --> 42:31.505
- Good luck, Greg.
- Good luck.

42:31.540 --> 42:32.506
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

42:32.541 --> 42:33.657
Thank you.

42:33.709 --> 42:35.809
This was a risk that I took,

42:35.845 --> 42:39.146
and it did not pay off,
so I'm going home.

42:41.384 --> 42:42.616
It's me, guys.

42:42.652 --> 42:43.684
- Aw.
- What?

42:43.736 --> 42:44.935
- Yeah.
- What?

42:44.987 --> 42:46.335
I have no regrets.

42:46.336 --> 42:48.673
I'm happy that I was a part
of the competition.

42:49.360 --> 42:52.320
My goal now is just to go back
to doing what I do.

42:52.321 --> 42:54.224
I love special effects make-up.

42:54.225 --> 42:55.371
I like teaching it.

42:55.372 --> 42:56.813
And I'm happy.
