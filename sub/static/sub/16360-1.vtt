00:02.602 --> 00:04.670
        (glass shatters)        

00:22.223 --> 00:24.790
         (quiet piano)          

02:29.016 --> 02:31.984
       (slow modern rock)       

02:36.223 --> 02:38.390
       - Are we burning         
       some midnight oil?       

02:38.392 --> 02:41.393
       - Hi Mom, I didn't       
       hear you coming.         

02:42.229 --> 02:43.128
              Wow.              

02:44.498 --> 02:47.566
      I guess I kinda got       
      caught up in it.          

02:53.307 --> 02:54.706
        - Something new?        

02:55.910 --> 02:58.610
   - I'm just experimenting.    

02:58.612 --> 03:00.345
      Following the music.      

03:01.782 --> 03:02.981
    I'm just going to work      
    for a couple of minutes     

03:02.983 --> 03:05.918
 and then I'm going to turn in. 

03:05.920 --> 03:07.586
      - Okay, sweetheart.       

03:10.224 --> 03:11.256
        Pleasant dreams.        

03:11.258 --> 03:12.157
           - You too.           

03:20.000 --> 03:21.133
         - I love you.          

03:23.037 --> 03:24.536
       - I love you too.        

03:50.698 --> 03:53.665
       (slow modern rock)       

04:20.160 --> 04:21.726
     (quiet, ominous piano)     

04:21.728 --> 04:22.694
          Sorry, Mom.           

04:23.864 --> 04:25.764
    I think that stereo has     
    a weird electrical short    

04:25.766 --> 04:26.932
         or something.          

04:31.171 --> 04:34.740
    I'm okay, I'm just          
    really into it tonight.     

04:35.976 --> 04:37.276
        Stop now, okay?         

04:39.680 --> 04:40.579
              Mom?              

04:50.090 --> 04:50.989
             Hello?             

05:01.969 --> 05:02.868
             Okay.              

05:43.844 --> 05:46.244
          (slow rock)           

05:51.452 --> 05:53.852
  - Oh my goodness, that girl.  

05:58.892 --> 05:59.791
              Hey.              

06:01.895 --> 06:04.029
   The stereo's really loud.    

06:06.633 --> 06:08.867
   Bethany, it's really late.   

06:19.179 --> 06:21.513
           (growling)           

06:25.085 --> 06:26.218
         Are you okay?          

06:27.087 --> 06:29.988
Why are you sitting in the dark?

06:29.990 --> 06:31.656
      Bethany, answer me.       

06:42.603 --> 06:44.936
           (growling)           

06:49.176 --> 06:50.709
            Bethany?            

06:50.711 --> 06:51.610
            Bethany!            

06:52.713 --> 06:55.180
     Oh my God, oh my God,      
     please let me in!          

06:55.182 --> 06:56.014
       (growling, roaring       
       and screaming)           

06:56.016 --> 06:56.915
           Let me in!           

07:02.089 --> 07:05.257
     (gasping and sobbing)      

07:06.226 --> 07:07.125
             Baby?              

07:08.028 --> 07:10.262
   Baby, baby, where are you?   

07:13.567 --> 07:15.033
            Bethany?            

07:15.035 --> 07:16.902
         Bethany, baby?         

07:16.904 --> 07:17.836
         Where are you?         

07:17.838 --> 07:18.670
           - Don't...           

07:18.672 --> 07:20.305
            Don't...            

07:20.307 --> 07:22.240
      - Don't, don't what?      

07:22.242 --> 07:23.642
       - Let him get me.        

07:23.644 --> 07:26.278
 - Bethany, baby, please, who?  

07:26.280 --> 07:27.946
     Don't let who get you?     

07:27.948 --> 07:30.348
          - (sobbing)           

07:31.351 --> 07:33.685
           (growling)           

07:37.958 --> 07:38.857
             - Ah!              

07:44.665 --> 07:47.232
         (quiet piano)          

07:50.971 --> 07:51.803
        (knock at door)         

07:51.805 --> 07:52.904
        - Just a second.        

07:52.906 --> 07:54.139
         Just a second.         

07:57.277 --> 07:58.944
         - Oh my gosh.          

07:58.946 --> 07:59.911
          Oh my gosh!           

07:59.913 --> 08:00.812
           - I know.            

08:01.849 --> 08:03.882
  - What are you going to do?   

08:03.884 --> 08:06.818
     - Sorry, I just found      
     out 15 minutes ago.        

08:06.820 --> 08:08.453
         - Right, well,         

08:08.455 --> 08:10.055
             shit!              

08:10.057 --> 08:11.490
            - Yeah.             

08:11.492 --> 08:12.791
- And you haven't told Buckley? 

08:12.793 --> 08:14.059
        - Oh my God, no.        

08:14.061 --> 08:16.027
      I gotta figure some       
      things out first.         

08:16.029 --> 08:17.596
- Are you guys having problems? 

08:17.598 --> 08:18.497
             - No.              

08:19.833 --> 08:21.466
I don't know, he keeps bringing 
up moving in together again.    

08:21.468 --> 08:23.068
   - And that's a bad thing?    

08:23.070 --> 08:25.637
   - It's just a step I'm not   
   sure I'm ready to take.      

08:25.639 --> 08:27.138
        - Oh, wait wait.        

08:27.140 --> 08:29.908
 So, in summary, you're in a    
 positive, healthy relationship 

08:29.910 --> 08:32.577
    with a solid,               
    gainfully employed guy,     

08:32.578 --> 08:35.179
       who actually wants       
       to commit to you,        

08:35.182 --> 08:37.414
whose child you're now carrying.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.551
    Tell me where I send the    
    condolence letters to.      

08:39.553 --> 08:40.784
     - I guess I got a lot      
     of stuff left over         

08:40.787 --> 08:42.754
   from how I grew up, and...   

08:42.756 --> 08:44.890
     I've been taking care      
     of myself for so long,     

08:44.892 --> 08:47.993
     and now with this          
     baby, I, I don't know.     

08:47.995 --> 08:50.228
  I'm not comfortable rushing   
  myself into any kind          

08:50.230 --> 08:51.863
      of giant commitment.      

08:51.865 --> 08:53.231
   - Yeah, but I think          
   after almost three years,    

08:53.233 --> 08:55.901
you're just dragging your feet. 

08:57.204 --> 08:59.671
       - Ugh, crap, I'm         
       going to be late.        

08:59.673 --> 09:01.540
    - Oh yeah, that meeting     
    with Senorita Spooky?       

09:01.542 --> 09:03.608
       - Yeah, it's gonna       
       be a long day.           

09:03.610 --> 09:05.544
     - Well, hey, call me       
     if you need me, okay?      

09:05.546 --> 09:06.378
           - Thanks.            

09:06.380 --> 09:07.279
             - Bye.             

09:10.350 --> 09:12.584
   - Thank you for your time    
   today, Professor Kern.       

09:12.586 --> 09:14.886
    Your expertise will be a    
    great asset to my thesis    

09:14.888 --> 09:18.223
      on the relevance of       
      parapsychology in         
      modern psychiatry.        

09:18.225 --> 09:19.691
         - My pleasure.         

09:19.693 --> 09:22.460
 Before we start, may I ask     
 what drew you to the subject?  

09:22.462 --> 09:24.529
     I don't get many           
     inquiries like yours.      

09:24.531 --> 09:26.298
     - I guess I've always      
     been a bit fascinated      

09:26.300 --> 09:28.033
    by the human condition.     

09:28.035 --> 09:29.701
      - Do you believe in       
      the supernatural?         

09:29.703 --> 09:31.636
      - Atheist searching       
      for a miracle.            

09:31.638 --> 09:34.806
  So just for the record, will  
  you please state your name?   

09:34.808 --> 09:38.143
  - Dr. Lois Kern, head of the  
  Parapsychology Department     

09:38.145 --> 09:40.078
    of Columbia University.     

09:40.080 --> 09:42.180
     - And how long have        
     you been investigating     

09:42.182 --> 09:44.683
     and researching claims     
     of the paranormal?         

09:44.685 --> 09:46.084
        - Over 20 years.        

09:46.086 --> 09:48.386
    I did my undergraduate      
    at Princeton University,    

09:48.388 --> 09:52.090
magna cum laude in the Classics,
and trained in Psychiatry       

09:52.092 --> 09:54.326
     at the Yale University     
     School of Medicine,        

09:54.328 --> 09:56.428
       before moving into       
       field studies.           

09:56.430 --> 09:59.030
   - And how many cases would   
   you say you've covered?      

09:59.032 --> 10:01.232
- Personally, I've overseen 200.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.936
   - How many were you able     
   to scientifically verify?    

10:04.938 --> 10:05.870
            - Three.            

10:05.872 --> 10:07.606
       - Out of 200, yes?       

10:07.608 --> 10:08.740
           - Mm hmm.            

10:08.742 --> 10:09.574
             - Hm.              

10:09.576 --> 10:10.408
    - You seem disappointed.    

10:10.410 --> 10:11.576
      - You have to admit,      

10:11.578 --> 10:13.378
    it's a very small           
    percentage of the whole.    

10:13.380 --> 10:15.280
       - Miss Carpenter,        

10:15.282 --> 10:17.649
    Veronica, I'd be remiss     
    if I didn't admit           

10:17.651 --> 10:21.553
   the majority of cases are    
   either outright hoaxes or,   

10:21.555 --> 10:23.788
      when held up to the       
      scrutiny of rigorous      

10:23.790 --> 10:25.390
  and regimented examination,   

10:25.392 --> 10:27.592
       fall under clearly       
       explainable means.       

10:27.594 --> 10:30.929
    And science has given us    
    answers to primal fears.    

10:30.931 --> 10:35.433
  What we once referred to as   
  monsters are now mutations.   

10:35.435 --> 10:37.435
  The nature and order of the   
  world and the human body      

10:37.437 --> 10:39.738
      can be seen in cells      
      under a microscope        

10:39.740 --> 10:41.439
     rather than the            
     pages of fairy tales.      

10:41.441 --> 10:44.009
     - But you do believe       
     there were three cases     

10:44.011 --> 10:45.610
       that have held up        
       to your rigorous         

10:45.612 --> 10:47.779
and regimented experimentation, 

10:47.781 --> 10:50.382
   and were verifiable beyond   
   natural explanation.         

10:50.384 --> 10:52.584
      - Levittstown,            
      Pennsylvania in '95.      

10:52.586 --> 10:54.953
    I witnessed a woman who     
    undoubtedly possessed       

10:54.955 --> 10:56.721
 strong telekinetic abilities,  

10:56.723 --> 10:59.591
     especially when            
     emotionally provoked.      

10:59.593 --> 11:02.994
  Small things, lights          
  flickering, drawers opening.  

11:02.996 --> 11:04.496
 Though her grandmother claimed 

11:04.498 --> 11:07.766
on a good day she could levitate
the household pets at will.     

11:07.768 --> 11:11.169
 2001, in Yonkers, I was on a   
 team investigating a haunting. 

11:11.171 --> 11:12.737
       - The McKutcheons.       

11:14.608 --> 11:16.741
     A family bought a          
     two-story fixer-upper,     

11:16.743 --> 11:19.611
   claimed multiple instances   
   of ghostly activity?         

11:19.613 --> 11:22.647
   - A group of four, and       
   myself, spent several days   

11:22.649 --> 11:24.983
    in the house                
    investigating incidents.    

11:24.985 --> 11:27.485
  - What about the third case?  

11:27.487 --> 11:28.586
          - The third.          

11:28.588 --> 11:30.789
      - The Clovitz case.       

11:30.791 --> 11:33.458
    The little boy, Jacob       
    Clovitz, ten years old,     

11:33.460 --> 11:35.226
     you're aware of the        
     case I'm referring to?     

11:35.228 --> 11:37.595
- It's the hallmark of my work. 

11:37.597 --> 11:40.498
   - Your study was the first   
   to officially medically      

11:40.500 --> 11:42.400
       validate an actual       
       case of possession       

11:42.402 --> 11:44.569
   in the New Oxford Review.    

11:45.639 --> 11:48.473
    You witnessed his           
    non-sanctioned exorcism?    

11:48.475 --> 11:49.741
             - Yes.             

11:49.743 --> 11:52.143
    Previous to the case,       
    because of my background    

11:52.145 --> 11:54.612
    in clinical psychiatry,     
    I'd been brought in         

11:54.614 --> 11:56.514
 to assist as a medical doctor. 

11:56.516 --> 11:57.615
- So this wasn't the first time.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.818
  - I've been party to seven.   

11:59.820 --> 12:02.554
     Exorcism has a history     
     in several cultures.       

12:02.556 --> 12:05.390
 Psychologically it's sometimes 
 useful as a pure placebo.      

12:05.392 --> 12:07.659
  The victim believes they're   
  under duress from forces.     

12:07.661 --> 12:11.096
   Performing the ritual,       
   under proper supervision,    

12:11.098 --> 12:12.363
helps the psychosis cure itself 

12:12.365 --> 12:14.165
 by the same suggestive means.  

12:14.167 --> 12:16.434
  - So these seven individuals  
  were all suffering            

12:16.436 --> 12:17.769
        from psychosis.         

12:18.872 --> 12:20.739
       You know, spinning       
       heads, pea soup.         

12:20.741 --> 12:21.573
             - No.              

12:21.575 --> 12:23.007
        I'm afraid not.         

12:23.009 --> 12:24.509
   - But do you believe         
   that Jacob was different,    

12:24.511 --> 12:27.345
     that he was under the      
     prevalent influence        

12:27.347 --> 12:31.116
     of multiple malevolent     
     demonic entities?          

12:31.118 --> 12:34.519
- Have you ever seen true evil? 

12:34.521 --> 12:35.653
    - I'm sorry, Professor,     

12:35.655 --> 12:39.090
    I'm not sure I              
    understand the question.    

12:39.092 --> 12:41.559
 Well, in personal experience,  

12:42.662 --> 12:45.096
       I have interviewed       
       prison inmates,          

12:45.098 --> 12:46.731
 convicted of rape and murder,  

12:46.733 --> 12:49.134
misogynists, deviants, killers. 

12:49.136 --> 12:50.568
My boyfriend has done some work 

12:50.570 --> 12:52.704
 for the police forensic unit.  

12:52.706 --> 12:55.740
He once photographed a six      
month old boy with broken ribs, 

12:55.742 --> 12:57.475
     whose mother happened      
     to be holding him          

12:57.477 --> 12:58.977
       at the inopportune       
       time that she got        

12:58.979 --> 13:01.780
 into a physical domestic spat. 

13:01.782 --> 13:03.948
    I even masochistically      
    watch the evening news,     

13:03.950 --> 13:07.018
     so I am fully aware        
     of the horrible things     

13:07.020 --> 13:08.820
       that human beings        
       are capable of.          

13:08.822 --> 13:12.657
   I do not, however, believe   
   in evil as an entity         

13:12.659 --> 13:15.827
 or consciousness beyond that.  

13:15.829 --> 13:17.796
      - All people are          
      capable of darkness.      

13:17.798 --> 13:21.266
      True evil, something      
      else altogether.          

13:21.268 --> 13:24.669
 It's not merely a collection   
 of badly wired brain impulses, 

13:24.671 --> 13:26.137
     or everyday brutality.     

13:26.139 --> 13:27.739
           It's more.           

13:27.741 --> 13:29.974
   It's the absence of light.   

13:31.311 --> 13:33.545
   - Tell me a little bit       
   more about Jacob Clovitz.    

13:33.547 --> 13:36.781
    - On the surface, it        
    appeared to be another,     

13:36.783 --> 13:38.283
       albeit rare, case        
       of abelobscene.          

13:38.285 --> 13:40.251
    Tremors and convulsions     
    soon developed              

13:40.253 --> 13:43.922
    into violent outbursts,     
    expressionless gazes,       

13:43.924 --> 13:46.191
      uncontrolled speech.      

13:46.193 --> 13:49.127
   He needed psychological      
   evaluation and treatment,    

13:49.129 --> 13:52.764
 but his devout parents felt    
 he was beyond modern medicine. 

13:52.766 --> 13:56.501
 They petitioned the Church for 
 intervention several times,    

13:56.503 --> 14:00.805
 but lack of evidence, previous 
 hospitalizations, and uh,      

14:00.807 --> 14:04.008
  a potential PR nightmare for  
  a scandal-plagued diocese...  

14:04.010 --> 14:06.177
   - And how did you            
   initially become involved?   

14:06.179 --> 14:07.278
          - His Aunt.           

14:07.280 --> 14:09.414
 A nurse, and personal friend.  

14:09.416 --> 14:10.682
- And she believed the parents, 

14:10.684 --> 14:13.017
    that the child was under    
    some sort of possession?    

14:13.019 --> 14:14.686
       - No, she thought        
       he was neglected         

14:14.688 --> 14:17.021
    until the day she           
    called me in hysterics.     

14:17.023 --> 14:19.023
She'd been watching him that day

14:19.025 --> 14:20.959
      when he somehow           
      found a metal spike,      

14:20.961 --> 14:23.995
       and began carving        
       into his own arm.        

14:23.997 --> 14:26.197
      She was unsure, and       
      feared for his life,      

14:26.199 --> 14:28.266
   and asked me to visit him.   

14:28.268 --> 14:29.167
           I agreed.            

14:30.003 --> 14:33.204
         He was sweet.          

14:33.206 --> 14:35.940
    He didn't disassociate,     

14:35.942 --> 14:39.477
  was unaware of what he said   
  or did during his fits,       

14:39.479 --> 14:41.746
   but knew that he had them,   
   and that it worsened.        

14:41.748 --> 14:44.315
     His states of lucidity     
     dwindled in relation       

14:44.317 --> 14:45.650
       to these episodes.       

14:45.652 --> 14:48.086
It was like he was disappearing.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.388
    - And you were there        
    the day of his exorcism.    

14:50.390 --> 14:54.592
  - Jacob's parents contacted   
  an unlicensed specialist.     

14:54.594 --> 14:57.328
    An excommunicated           
    priest, Father Santiago.    

14:57.330 --> 14:58.863
      - What did you see?       

14:58.865 --> 15:00.098
        - [Boy] Help me.        

15:00.100 --> 15:03.268
    (priest chants in Latin)    

15:03.270 --> 15:06.938
     - I don't think I can      
     explain what occurred.     

15:09.009 --> 15:12.510
     I can tell you nothing     
     in my lifetime,            

15:12.512 --> 15:15.280
    my work before or after,    

15:15.282 --> 15:17.282
    could have prepared me.     

15:18.585 --> 15:21.653
      I've spent the last       
      12 years trying.          

15:34.267 --> 15:35.600
 - Is that your tape recording? 

15:35.602 --> 15:39.103
      - I couldn't listen       
      until months later.       

15:39.105 --> 15:41.372
       Are you sure you         
       want to hear this?       

15:41.374 --> 15:44.275
    - Thank you, Professor,     
    I can handle it.            

15:44.277 --> 15:45.176
              Yes.              

15:49.215 --> 15:53.451
      (many voices howling      
      and screeching)           

16:07.100 --> 16:08.466
- Seven hours later, no change. 

16:08.468 --> 16:09.801
  I took a much-needed break.   

16:09.803 --> 16:12.103
    After only a few minutes    
    of having left the room,    

16:12.105 --> 16:13.304
he violently attacked his father

16:13.306 --> 16:16.474
      and jumped out a          
      third floor window.       

16:16.476 --> 16:17.909
    - The boy died, correct?    

16:17.911 --> 16:20.244
      - Yes, but not from       
      the initial fall.         

16:20.246 --> 16:22.747
    He made it three blocks     
    on severely broken legs     

16:22.749 --> 16:23.948
   before running directly...   

16:23.950 --> 16:26.017
         (tires squeal)         

16:26.019 --> 16:29.654
   In my expert opinion, this   
   boy was under the control    

16:29.656 --> 16:32.390
of something that was true evil.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.063
- Can I get a copy of that tape?

16:48.141 --> 16:50.875
        (camera clicks)         

16:54.781 --> 16:56.614
      What are you doing?       

16:56.616 --> 16:58.649
- [Buckley] Professional, smart,

16:58.651 --> 16:59.717
          sex goddess.          

17:01.554 --> 17:03.187
  - I'm trying to focus here.   

17:03.189 --> 17:04.722
            - Sorry.            

17:04.723 --> 17:05.589
             Sorry.             

17:07.327 --> 17:08.893
       Very interesting.        

17:08.895 --> 17:10.161
        - It's research.        

17:10.163 --> 17:11.429
    I'm meeting up with that    
    professor again tomorrow    

17:11.431 --> 17:12.997
       to investigate           
       this lady's claims       

17:12.999 --> 17:16.000
   that her house is            
   besieged by evil spirits.    

17:16.002 --> 17:17.468
      - You're kidding me.      

17:17.470 --> 17:19.037
You buy into any of this stuff? 

17:19.039 --> 17:20.771
        - Of course not.        

17:20.773 --> 17:22.807
    - Not even a little bit?    

17:22.809 --> 17:25.742
     - We don't live in         
     the dark ages anymore.     

17:25.744 --> 17:26.911
             What?              

17:26.913 --> 17:28.880
     - I'm totally sleeping     
     with a heathen.            

17:28.882 --> 17:29.814
         - Oh shut up.          

17:29.816 --> 17:31.115
   Like you're so righteous?    

17:31.117 --> 17:32.550
      - Hey, my family's        
      from North Carolina.      

17:32.552 --> 17:34.285
  We're some God-fearing folk.  

17:34.287 --> 17:35.286
     - I don't know, I          
     guess if anybody could     

17:35.288 --> 17:36.821
   make me a true believer...   

17:36.823 --> 17:38.089
    She's debunked way more     

17:38.091 --> 17:41.692
    than she's proven to be     
    true paranormal events.     

17:41.694 --> 17:43.528
     Fellow academics           
     lovingly refer to her      

17:43.530 --> 17:45.430
     as the miracle killer.     

17:46.533 --> 17:48.399
     - [Buckley] But now        
     she believes in this?      

17:48.401 --> 17:49.667
      - [Girl] Maybe even       
      more than people          

17:49.669 --> 17:51.669
     who had just jumped to     
     conclusions, you know.     

17:51.671 --> 17:54.172
   It's like she's actually     
   looking for real evidence    

17:54.174 --> 17:55.873
     that there's something     
     more out there.            

17:55.875 --> 17:59.310
    One case in particular      
    spooked her pretty bad.     

17:59.312 --> 18:01.913
       This kid died in a       
       botched exorcism.        

18:01.915 --> 18:02.747
            - Whoa.             

18:02.749 --> 18:03.714
            - Yeah.             

18:03.716 --> 18:06.984
She played me the craziest tape.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.619
   I got a copy for my notes.   

18:08.621 --> 18:11.556
     - Well, this is all        
     pretty enthralling         
     pre-bedtime material.      

18:11.558 --> 18:12.957
      There was something       
      else I kinda wanted       

18:12.959 --> 18:13.958
     to talk to you about.      

18:13.960 --> 18:15.460
             - Oh?              

18:15.462 --> 18:16.461
  - I was just wondering if     
  you'd thought any more about  

18:16.463 --> 18:17.962
        what I asked you        
        about last week.        

18:17.964 --> 18:19.497
   - I, I just, I really have   
   a lot of reading to do.      

18:19.499 --> 18:21.399
      - I mean, it just         
      makes sense, right?       

18:21.401 --> 18:23.201
       We're both in new        
       periods of growth.       

18:23.203 --> 18:25.002
    I'd really like to come     
    home to the same place      

18:25.004 --> 18:26.504
       as you every day.        

18:26.506 --> 18:27.472
          Officially.           

18:30.844 --> 18:33.478
     - We are in a really       
     good place right now.      

18:33.480 --> 18:35.947
     We can talk about it       
     again soon, I promise.     

18:35.949 --> 18:37.415
       This is so crazy.        

18:38.885 --> 18:40.351
   Look at these statistics.    

18:40.353 --> 18:43.821
   Sixty percent of Americans   
   believe in ghosts?           

18:43.823 --> 18:47.024
  Another twenty percent        
  claim a personal experience.  

18:47.026 --> 18:48.493
              Hey.              

18:48.495 --> 18:50.495
   Uh, forty eight percent...   

18:50.497 --> 18:51.662
         Buckley, stop.         

18:51.664 --> 18:53.798
   - I can't control myself.    

18:53.800 --> 18:54.966
           - Buckley!           

18:54.968 --> 18:56.667
      - There is no             
      Buckley, only Zool.       

18:56.669 --> 18:59.237
 - No wait, look, look at this. 

18:59.239 --> 19:01.105
   Five stages of a haunting.   

19:01.107 --> 19:02.540
        Okay, stage one.        

19:02.542 --> 19:05.376
   Cold spots, noises,          
   odors, hearing footsteps,    

19:05.378 --> 19:07.778
 and feelings of being watched. 

19:07.780 --> 19:09.347
         It's so weird.         

19:09.349 --> 19:12.150
      Stage two, gets more      
      advanced, right?          

19:12.152 --> 19:14.685
       Whispers, laughs,        
       moans, shrieking.        

19:14.687 --> 19:17.021
      - Moans, shrieking,       
      now I'm interested.       

19:17.023 --> 19:20.525
     - Moans and shrieking      
     and moving shadows.        

19:23.096 --> 19:25.997
  Stage three, lights and       
  other electrical appliances   

19:25.999 --> 19:27.665
      turning on and off.       

19:32.205 --> 19:34.739
     Unseen hands               
     grabbing or touching.      

19:34.741 --> 19:36.908
 Writings or pattern markings.  

19:36.910 --> 19:39.977
       Doors that open or       
       close themselves.        

19:46.719 --> 19:50.087
   Stage four, the appearance   
   of full apparitions,         

19:50.089 --> 19:53.925
    movement or disappearing    
    of objects, windows,        

19:53.927 --> 19:57.728
mirrors or other household      
objects breaking for no reason. 

19:57.730 --> 19:58.629
              And,              

19:59.966 --> 20:01.532
       stage five, here.        

20:01.534 --> 20:04.068
     The culmination of all     
     the events previous        

20:04.070 --> 20:06.003
    but with more intensity.    

20:06.005 --> 20:09.640
 The entity has gradually moved 
 up into clear consciousness    

20:09.642 --> 20:12.176
      from the energy           
      it's been building,       

20:12.178 --> 20:14.579
  and then things get violent.  

20:22.288 --> 20:24.622
           (growling)           

20:27.427 --> 20:28.392
             - Mom!             

20:28.394 --> 20:29.894
              Mom!              

20:29.896 --> 20:30.795
              Mom!              

20:40.073 --> 20:41.739
      - Sorry if I kept         
      you waiting at all.       

20:41.741 --> 20:43.307
      The trains were           
      death this morning.       

20:43.309 --> 20:44.275
        - Good morning.         

20:44.277 --> 20:46.077
  I hope you got a good rest.   

20:46.079 --> 20:47.545
       - Why, is there a        
       decathlon portion        

20:47.547 --> 20:49.280
  of the day I'm not aware of?  

20:49.282 --> 20:50.448
     - Oh, these                
     investigations can be      

20:50.450 --> 20:52.984
    very taxing emotionally     
    on all parties.             

20:52.986 --> 20:54.318
       It's best to enter       
       with a clear mind        

20:54.320 --> 20:55.853
      and a full battery.       

20:55.855 --> 20:58.089
   - Well, I've got my little   
   cup of go-go juice here,     

20:58.091 --> 21:00.491
  so let's not waste any time.  

21:01.894 --> 21:04.395
 - You've got a lot of spirit.  

21:11.871 --> 21:14.872
 - You'll have to forgive me,   
 this is all pretty new to me.  

21:14.874 --> 21:18.109
    I'm still trying to wrap    
    my head around it all.      

21:18.111 --> 21:19.877
    I've been working           
    doubles at the hospital     

21:19.879 --> 21:21.679
   with everything happening.   

21:21.681 --> 21:25.082
Uh, we're both a little on edge.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.217
         Sugar or milk?         

21:26.219 --> 21:28.286
 - No, this is fine, thank you. 

21:28.288 --> 21:30.354
      - Please, just            
      from the beginning.       

21:30.356 --> 21:34.058
       - Well, it started       
       maybe a month ago.       

21:34.060 --> 21:36.027
      Not enough to really      
      notice at first.          

21:36.029 --> 21:37.828
       I would come home.       

21:37.830 --> 21:39.330
        It was freezing.        

21:39.332 --> 21:41.332
     My daughter thought        
     the pipes were broken,     

21:41.334 --> 21:43.901
     because of this loud       
     clanging and banging.      

21:43.903 --> 21:45.836
       Then, there were         
       the other sounds.        

21:45.838 --> 21:47.838
   - Um, what kind of sounds?   

21:47.840 --> 21:49.407
  - I feel silly saying this.   

21:49.409 --> 21:50.608
      I mean, it's crazy.       

21:50.610 --> 21:52.076
    - It's okay, Ms. Mills.     

21:52.078 --> 21:53.344
            - Joan.             

21:53.346 --> 21:56.380
      - Joan, just be as        
      detailed as you can.      

21:57.150 --> 21:58.416
       - Mocking sounds.        

21:58.418 --> 22:01.319
     Whispers, laughter,        
     things would be moved.     

22:01.321 --> 22:02.620
          I'm scared.           

22:02.622 --> 22:05.289
    - Have you or anyone in     
    the house been attacked     

22:05.291 --> 22:06.757
    or physically assaulted?    

22:06.759 --> 22:09.493
  - Bethany, my daughter,       
  she was thrown from the bed   

22:09.495 --> 22:10.995
        a few weeks ago.        

22:10.997 --> 22:12.096
      I went in the room.       

22:12.098 --> 22:13.931
     I couldn't see anyone.     

22:13.933 --> 22:15.166
         But I felt it.         

22:15.168 --> 22:18.002
       Right behind me,         
       I felt this anger.       

22:18.004 --> 22:19.637
      And my girl, she          
      hasn't been herself.      

22:19.639 --> 22:21.639
    She won't eat, or sleep.    

22:21.641 --> 22:23.407
Sometimes she's just zoning out.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.976
  - Have you ever experienced   
  anything like this            

22:25.978 --> 22:27.678
    previous to a month ago?    

22:27.680 --> 22:31.515
    - No, we've been in this    
    house over 20 years.        

22:32.418 --> 22:35.086
    After my husband passed,    

22:35.088 --> 22:38.189
   he had bone cancer when my   
   daughter was very young.     

22:38.191 --> 22:40.524
      We've never had           
      anything like this.       

22:40.526 --> 22:43.661
  - Has your daughter always    
  been in the house with you?   

22:43.663 --> 22:44.895
         - Last year...         

22:49.001 --> 22:51.836
   She was in a bad accident.   

22:51.838 --> 22:55.039
     The driver wrapped         
     his car around a tree.     

22:55.041 --> 22:56.207
        Died instantly.         

22:56.209 --> 22:58.442
   We weren't sure she was...   

23:00.179 --> 23:01.545
           I'm sorry,           

23:01.547 --> 23:04.148
    you just go through         
    this with your husband,     

23:04.150 --> 23:06.884
 and then with your own child.  

23:06.886 --> 23:09.420
I'm not a very religious person,

23:09.422 --> 23:13.524
    but I prayed to every       
    deity I could remember,     

23:13.526 --> 23:15.926
  and then made up some the     
  day that she opened her eyes  

23:15.928 --> 23:17.428
         and came back.         

23:17.430 --> 23:19.563
   - What kind of injuries      
   did your daughter sustain    

23:19.565 --> 23:20.498
         in the crash?          

23:20.500 --> 23:23.134
- Severe swelling, hemorrhaging,

23:23.970 --> 23:25.870
 she was in a coma a few weeks. 

23:25.872 --> 23:27.271
      Terrible migraines.       

23:27.273 --> 23:29.140
     - Um, what kind of         
     medication was she on?     

23:29.142 --> 23:30.541
    - Pain killers, mostly.     

23:30.543 --> 23:32.476
 - Any permanent brain damage?  

23:32.478 --> 23:34.879
      - No, no, thank God.      

23:34.881 --> 23:37.948
    All scans and tests came    
    back perfectly fine.        

23:37.950 --> 23:41.352
      I think the doctors       
      were even surprised.      

23:41.354 --> 23:42.686
       - Is she home now?       

23:42.688 --> 23:44.422
      May we speak to her?      

23:48.461 --> 23:49.527
          - Ms. Mills?          

23:50.596 --> 23:51.662
     Where's your daughter?     

23:51.664 --> 23:54.899
     (tea kettle whistles)      

23:57.970 --> 23:59.203
         (door creaks)          

23:59.205 --> 24:00.738
      I can't seem to           
      get her to come up.       

24:00.740 --> 24:03.908
     She says it's not safe     
     for her to come up.        

24:03.910 --> 24:05.709
       I want to tell her       
       she's ridiculous,        

24:05.711 --> 24:07.445
  that it's perfectly safe...   

24:07.447 --> 24:09.914
 - But you don't believe that?  

24:11.017 --> 24:13.951
      - I don't know what       
      I believe anymore.        

24:13.953 --> 24:16.754
        - May we go down        
        in the basement?        

24:22.261 --> 24:23.260
         - Hi, Bethany.         

24:23.262 --> 24:25.229
     My name is Lois Kern,      

24:25.231 --> 24:28.399
   and this is my associate,    
   Veronica Carpenter.          

24:28.401 --> 24:30.501
   We'd like to talk to you     
   about what's been going on   

24:30.503 --> 24:31.569
         in the house.          

24:31.571 --> 24:32.470
            - I see.            

24:33.272 --> 24:34.538
  - Your mother's filled us in  

24:34.540 --> 24:36.740
      on what you've both       
      been going through,       

24:36.742 --> 24:39.944
   but we'd like to hear from   
   you as well, if it's okay.   

24:39.946 --> 24:42.913
      - I'm not sure what       
      I can tell you.           

24:42.915 --> 24:44.014
 - This is really lovely work.  

24:44.016 --> 24:45.483
         Is this yours?         

24:45.485 --> 24:49.653
  - Yeah, um, I'm not sure      
  where it's going right now.   

24:49.655 --> 24:52.389
It's, it's kind of a mood piece.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.693
     They say that artists      
     are always channeling      

24:55.695 --> 24:58.395
what's going below the surface. 

24:58.397 --> 25:00.197
    In art school it was all    

25:00.199 --> 25:01.832
      mastering technique       
      and discipline,           

25:01.834 --> 25:05.169
  and then stripping that away  
  and returning to intuition.   

25:05.171 --> 25:06.437
       - It seems like          
       a long way around        

25:06.439 --> 25:07.738
       to get back where        
       you started from.        

25:07.740 --> 25:08.973
      - [Bethany] Agreed.       

25:08.975 --> 25:11.075
      - Do you spend a lot      
      of time down here?        

25:11.077 --> 25:12.142
          - Sometimes.          

25:14.480 --> 25:15.980
         Lately, yeah.          

25:15.982 --> 25:17.548
   - Your mother says you've    
   been spending more time      

25:17.550 --> 25:21.151
      down here since the       
      incidents started.        

25:21.153 --> 25:23.854
    - It's safer down here.     

25:23.856 --> 25:26.524
   - What do you mean safer?    

25:26.526 --> 25:29.093
      - Do you feel safer       
      down here, Bethany?       

25:29.095 --> 25:31.695
   - I won't let it hurt her.   

25:31.697 --> 25:32.596
             - Who?             

25:34.033 --> 25:35.165
        - Don't do that.        

25:35.167 --> 25:36.066
            - What?             

25:37.570 --> 25:38.769
            - That.             

25:38.771 --> 25:40.538
      It's condescending.       

25:40.540 --> 25:41.805
         - I apologize.         

25:41.807 --> 25:42.740
         I didn't know.         

25:42.742 --> 25:43.741
          - You know.           

25:45.645 --> 25:48.178
    You know there's            
    something very bad here.    

25:48.180 --> 25:51.615
     - Do you believe your      
     house is haunted?          

25:51.617 --> 25:52.683
 - I don't know about all that. 

25:54.687 --> 25:56.003
              I...              

25:56.004 --> 25:57.320
      I just feel sorry         
      for my poor mother.       

25:57.323 --> 25:58.889
    She's stressed at work,     

25:58.891 --> 26:02.693
    and she's scared for        
    me, because she knows...    

26:03.596 --> 26:06.030
 - What does she know, Bethany? 

26:06.032 --> 26:08.699
- I'm the one they really want. 

26:10.169 --> 26:12.469
  My father was my protector.   

26:17.843 --> 26:18.826
               He               

26:18.827 --> 26:19.810
      would scoop me up if      
      I had a nightmare.        

26:19.812 --> 26:23.380
And he would tell me that       
everything was going to be okay,

26:23.382 --> 26:25.950
 and that no one would hurt me. 

26:27.053 --> 26:28.986
    You know, if there was      
    something in the closet,    

26:28.988 --> 26:32.222
or under the bed, he'd save me. 

26:32.224 --> 26:33.524
 When he first got really sick, 

26:33.526 --> 26:36.493
       they took him to         
       the hospital ward.       

26:36.495 --> 26:38.128
      And I couldn't sleep      
      through the night,        

26:38.130 --> 26:39.029
            because,            

26:40.933 --> 26:43.500
 my protector was far away, and 

26:44.637 --> 26:46.270
       the things in the        
       dark could get me.       

26:46.272 --> 26:47.938
      I visited him once.       

26:48.874 --> 26:51.208
  He looked so sick and weak.   

26:56.449 --> 26:57.348
              But,              

27:00.853 --> 27:03.253
  he told me about this light.  

27:04.023 --> 27:05.322
           And that,            

27:05.324 --> 27:07.458
       he was only moving       
       on to somewhere          

27:07.460 --> 27:10.060
       that he could look       
       after us better.         

27:10.062 --> 27:11.895
     That he was never          
     gonna actually leave.      

27:11.897 --> 27:14.431
And I could sleep again because,

27:14.433 --> 27:16.700
      when I saw sunshine       
      or a flame I'd say,       

27:16.702 --> 27:18.102
        oh, there he is.        

27:20.673 --> 27:22.573
     He's watching over us.     

27:27.380 --> 27:29.413
 But now, with all this stuff,  

27:29.415 --> 27:31.482
    it was a lie, wasn't it?    

27:32.652 --> 27:36.453
    Maybe there's no light,     
    there's no after this.      

27:36.455 --> 27:38.088
      There are still           
      things in the dark.       

27:38.090 --> 27:40.391
     - What kind of things?     

27:40.393 --> 27:41.792
        - Hungry things.        

27:43.996 --> 27:46.163
      - Do you know what's      
      in this house?            

27:46.165 --> 27:47.564
        - It's darkness.        

27:52.038 --> 27:54.405
   Blacker than the blackest.   

27:54.407 --> 27:55.673
  I thought I was going crazy,  

27:55.675 --> 27:58.409
       and I'm still not        
       sure I'm not, but        

27:59.812 --> 28:01.912
 I just don't understand what,  

28:01.914 --> 28:03.881
     I don't understand why     
     it's happening to us.      

28:03.883 --> 28:04.815
  I mean, did we do something?  

28:04.817 --> 28:06.050
      Did I do something?       

28:06.052 --> 28:08.852
       - You didn't do          
       anything, Bethany.       

28:10.256 --> 28:13.891
   - I'm sorry, I guess I'm a   
   little bit of a mess here.   

28:13.893 --> 28:15.092
          - It's okay.          

28:15.094 --> 28:18.829
     It's, it's okay to         
     fall apart sometimes.      

28:18.831 --> 28:20.097
     We pick ourselves up.      

28:20.099 --> 28:21.865
       Stay strong and...       

28:21.867 --> 28:25.202
    Is your family              
    particularly religious?     

28:25.204 --> 28:26.904
    - Like church and stuff?    

28:26.906 --> 28:28.472
           - Mm hmm.            

28:28.474 --> 28:32.309
     - No, I mean, we went      
     to church a few times,     

28:32.311 --> 28:35.045
and Mom prayed a lot when Dad...

28:37.583 --> 28:39.650
    I guess it didn't stick.    

28:41.020 --> 28:45.022
  - We often find strengths in  
  the unlikeliest of places.    

28:45.024 --> 28:47.691
  I have something dear to me   

28:47.693 --> 28:49.993
       that might help          
       you find strength.       

28:49.995 --> 28:52.629
   Something given to me that   

28:52.631 --> 28:54.865
     I'd like to offer you.     

28:54.867 --> 28:59.103
      - (growls) Don't you      
      dare fucking cross        
      me with that again.       

29:10.049 --> 29:11.115
         I'm so sorry.          

29:11.117 --> 29:12.015
             Uh...              

29:13.786 --> 29:14.685
           I'm sorry.           

29:15.788 --> 29:18.055
      I don't know what...      

29:18.057 --> 29:20.591
   I, I, I don't know what...   

29:20.593 --> 29:22.726
            (coughs)            

29:23.896 --> 29:25.395
           - Bethany.           

29:25.397 --> 29:26.230
            Bethany?            

29:26.232 --> 29:27.131
           - Bethany.           

29:30.302 --> 29:32.770
 We need to call an ambulance.  

29:51.757 --> 29:53.223
       - Please help me.        

29:57.930 --> 30:00.497
         (quiet piano)          

30:19.351 --> 30:21.685
 - What are you gonna name it?  

30:21.687 --> 30:22.753
          - Name what?          

30:23.923 --> 30:24.922
          - The baby.           

30:28.627 --> 30:29.693
          - I'm sorry.          

30:31.197 --> 30:32.529
            I'm not.            

30:32.531 --> 30:33.430
           Excuse me.           

30:42.608 --> 30:43.540
        - Are you okay?         

30:43.542 --> 30:45.075
            - What?             

30:45.077 --> 30:49.046
   Yeah, I was just getting     
   a little stuffy in there.    

30:49.048 --> 30:51.248
      - What did she say?       

30:51.250 --> 30:52.149
           - Nothing.           

30:53.152 --> 30:56.119
It was just a misunderstanding. 

30:56.121 --> 30:59.556
  So, Joan and her daughter's   
  story seem to fit most        

30:59.558 --> 31:01.225
of the five stages of a haunting

31:01.227 --> 31:02.726
 as per your research outline.  

31:02.728 --> 31:04.194
    - I don't think we're       
    dealing with a haunting.    

31:04.196 --> 31:05.963
      - You think they're       
      making it up.             

31:05.965 --> 31:07.464
 I wasn't sure myself, I mean,  

31:07.466 --> 31:09.066
   the mother's been working    
   herself to the bone,         

31:09.068 --> 31:10.901
       and the daughter's       
       severe head trauma       

31:10.903 --> 31:13.370
     would account for any      
     personality shifts,        

31:13.372 --> 31:15.873
 but that thing with the nail?  

31:17.176 --> 31:19.309
   - I'm afraid we're dealing   
   with something else.         

31:19.311 --> 31:21.278
      - I'm not following.      

31:21.280 --> 31:24.815
    - A haunting at its most    
    basic is leftover energy    

31:24.817 --> 31:27.751
     from a human presence,     
     their experiences.         

31:27.753 --> 31:31.822
   I'm now believing that       
   whatever is in this house    

31:34.126 --> 31:35.926
     has never been human.      

31:43.335 --> 31:44.601
            - Baby.             

31:44.603 --> 31:46.436
        You have to eat.        

31:46.438 --> 31:48.338
     Keep your strength up.     

31:50.843 --> 31:52.376
       - I'm not hungry.        

31:52.378 --> 31:53.944
       Baby, please, try.       

31:55.147 --> 31:57.514
    Please try just for me.     

31:57.516 --> 31:58.882
             - No!              

31:58.884 --> 32:00.784
     I said I'm not hungry!     

32:05.891 --> 32:06.757
            I'm so..            

32:06.759 --> 32:09.559
    I'm so sorry, I'm, I, I,    

32:09.561 --> 32:11.094
      I didn't mean, I...       

32:11.096 --> 32:12.262
         - Sh, sh, sh.          

32:13.232 --> 32:14.631
        It's okay, baby.        

32:14.633 --> 32:16.266
           It's okay.           

32:16.268 --> 32:19.569
      It's okay, I'll           
      make something else.      

32:19.571 --> 32:20.570
          Sh, sh, sh.           

32:22.207 --> 32:23.106
           It's okay.           

32:24.343 --> 32:25.242
           It's okay.           

32:27.379 --> 32:29.446
    - I wish Dad were here.     

32:29.448 --> 32:31.081
         - Oh, I know.          

32:31.083 --> 32:33.083
    I know, I miss him too.     

32:34.086 --> 32:35.852
        - You miss him?         

32:35.854 --> 32:36.753
            - I do.             

32:37.823 --> 32:39.389
       I do, so, so much.       

32:42.561 --> 32:43.894
             - Yes.             

32:43.896 --> 32:45.062
         The way he...          

32:47.499 --> 32:48.565
          Trusts you!           

33:37.783 --> 33:40.784
       (distant growling)       

33:44.923 --> 33:45.822
           - Buckley?           

33:48.027 --> 33:49.659
      What are you doing?       

33:53.465 --> 33:56.600
  Turn it off, it's not funny.  

33:56.602 --> 33:58.535
      I said, turn it off!      

33:58.537 --> 34:01.171
          - (shrieks)           

34:01.173 --> 34:02.839
    Hey, Christ, you scared     
    the shit out of me.         

34:02.841 --> 34:04.708
     Is everything alright?     

34:07.880 --> 34:10.714
    - I didn't know you         
    were coming over today.     

34:10.716 --> 34:12.949
     - Oh, yeah, I got done     
     at the studio early.       

34:12.951 --> 34:15.786
    I figured we could          
    order in, watch a movie.    

34:15.788 --> 34:16.953
Hey, what's going on, you okay? 

34:16.955 --> 34:19.322
     - I'm fine, I just...      

34:19.324 --> 34:21.257
     Look, I gave you the       
     key to the apartment,      

34:21.260 --> 34:22.759
       but it would still       
       be nice to know          

34:22.761 --> 34:24.761
  when you're gonna be here     
  instead of just showing up.   

34:24.763 --> 34:27.998
 - Hey, is this about the tape? 

34:28.000 --> 34:29.065
         I was just...          

34:29.068 --> 34:30.766
   It was out, I was curious.   

34:30.768 --> 34:32.268
     I mean, can you blame      
     me, how often...           

34:32.271 --> 34:34.438
   - It's just not respectful   
   to enter someone's home      

34:34.440 --> 34:36.706
    and start going through     
    all their things.           

34:36.708 --> 34:40.677
     A little civility          
     would be appreciated.      

34:40.679 --> 34:42.379
      What if I just            
      came to your studio       

34:42.380 --> 34:43.780
     and started going          
     through all your bags      

34:43.782 --> 34:45.614
    and your equipment, huh?    

34:45.617 --> 34:46.449
      What are you doing?       

34:46.452 --> 34:47.751
       Come on, Buckley.        

34:47.753 --> 34:49.686
       - No, no, not when       
       you get like this.       

34:49.688 --> 34:51.922
     I know enough to           
     just exit stage left.      

34:51.924 --> 34:53.090
  I guess this is the one perk  

34:53.092 --> 34:54.623
    of us still having          
    separate places, right?     

34:54.626 --> 34:58.128
      You can just bail         
      when it gets heavy.       

34:58.130 --> 34:59.563
           - Buckley.           

34:59.565 --> 35:02.866
     (quiet, ominous piano)     

35:42.274 --> 35:44.841
         (phone rings)          

35:49.081 --> 35:49.980
             Hello?             

35:51.850 --> 35:52.749
             Hello?             

35:56.722 --> 35:58.522
         (phone rings)          

35:58.524 --> 35:59.422
             Jesus.             

36:00.759 --> 36:01.658
             Yeah.              

36:02.728 --> 36:03.894
    - [Ghostly Voice] Do        
    not come back to me now.    

36:03.896 --> 36:05.095
         - Who is this?         

36:06.465 --> 36:09.266
       - [Ghostly Voice]        
       Please, me safe.         

36:09.268 --> 36:11.568
  - Listen, Keeley, if this     
  is some kind of stupid joke,  

36:11.570 --> 36:13.870
     it's not funny, okay?      

36:13.872 --> 36:17.107
  - [Ghostly Voice] (growls     
  and speaks incomprehensibly)  

36:17.109 --> 36:19.309
      - Listen, I'm gonna       
      call the cops.            

36:19.311 --> 36:23.547
 - [Ghostly Voice] She belongs  
 to us, and she's ours.         

36:27.352 --> 36:31.087
  (exorcism audio file plays)   

37:01.486 --> 37:03.820
           (growling)           

37:20.505 --> 37:21.404
             - No.              

37:36.321 --> 37:37.587
       Oh God, oh my God.       

37:37.589 --> 37:38.488
           Oh my God.           

37:38.490 --> 37:39.556
          Who are you?          

37:40.425 --> 37:42.092
   What do you want from us?    

37:42.094 --> 37:44.461
     Just leave her alone!      

37:44.463 --> 37:46.863
  Just please leave her alone!  

37:48.734 --> 37:50.033
        Please, please.         

37:52.371 --> 37:55.171
       - [Ghostly Voice]        
       She invited us.          

37:57.042 --> 37:59.242
      And we like it here.      

37:59.244 --> 38:00.110
            (roars)             

38:00.112 --> 38:02.512
          - (screams)           

38:32.577 --> 38:35.745
      - [Ghostly Voice]         
      But she invited us.       

38:36.581 --> 38:38.315
   (Mother whispers prayers)    

38:38.317 --> 38:39.282
          Invited us.           

38:47.859 --> 38:50.327
      You know what he did      
      to her, didn't you?       

38:50.329 --> 38:51.294
          Didn't you?           

38:53.965 --> 38:55.432
           - Bethany.           

38:55.434 --> 38:57.133
 - [Ghostly Voice] Every night. 

38:57.135 --> 38:59.602
       Every night, you         
       know what happens?       

38:59.604 --> 39:00.670
          Every night?          

39:18.724 --> 39:21.224
          (girl roars)          

39:28.300 --> 39:29.366
          - Ms. Mills.          

39:32.404 --> 39:34.471
    - Something's happening.    

39:36.908 --> 39:38.641
       - You're sure you        
       heard her right.         

39:38.643 --> 39:40.143
       She said Gahenna.        

39:40.145 --> 39:42.078
   - I thought it was just      
   a rain of sound at first,    

39:42.080 --> 39:43.813
      but it was so clear.      

39:44.883 --> 39:46.349
       My God, her eyes.        

39:47.652 --> 39:50.286
      If you saw her            
      face, it wasn't her.      

39:50.288 --> 39:52.722
      - Veronica, stay up       
      here with Ms. Mills.      

39:52.724 --> 39:53.556
          - Well, why?          

39:53.558 --> 39:54.824
        What's going on?        

39:54.826 --> 39:56.926
     - I'm going downstairs     
     to check on Bethany.       

39:56.928 --> 39:59.195
- So, then I should go with you.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.031
    - Uh, no, no, I need to     
    be sure of something.       

40:02.033 --> 40:03.500
        - Wait, what...         

40:03.502 --> 40:05.201
        What is Gahenna?        

40:05.203 --> 40:06.436
         - It's Hebrew.         

40:07.406 --> 40:08.571
    It's the word for Hell.     

40:08.573 --> 40:09.672
    - This is crazy, you...     

40:09.674 --> 40:12.008
  - Just stay with Ms. Mills!   

40:14.045 --> 40:15.879
You were to observe and assist. 

40:15.881 --> 40:19.482
      Now, I'm asking you       
      to by staying here.       

40:19.484 --> 40:21.885
  I'll be, I'll be right back.  

40:39.004 --> 40:39.903
            Bethany?            

40:44.443 --> 40:45.341
            Bethany?            

40:53.652 --> 40:54.717
          Who are you?          

40:57.255 --> 40:58.321
          Who are you?          

40:59.157 --> 41:01.791
         (stereo plays)         

41:07.799 --> 41:09.065
          Who are you?          

41:09.067 --> 41:12.535
       - Like he said, my       
       names are legion.        

41:12.537 --> 41:13.937
        For we are many.        

41:15.640 --> 41:16.873
         - Who are you?         

41:18.477 --> 41:20.410
  - [Veronica] Professor Kern?  

41:20.412 --> 41:22.312
     - I said, who are you!     

41:23.181 --> 41:24.747
       Tell me your name!       

41:26.618 --> 41:27.851
       What is your name?       

41:27.853 --> 41:28.685
           (screams)            

41:28.687 --> 41:30.253
       - [Veronica] Lois!       

41:44.469 --> 41:45.368
             - You!             

41:48.273 --> 41:51.574
     (shrieks thunderously)     

42:09.160 --> 42:10.627
       - Professor Kern?        

42:13.331 --> 42:14.497
 You need to go to the hospital 

42:14.499 --> 42:17.100
      and have that             
      properly looked at.       

42:18.336 --> 42:19.636
        Do you hear me?         

42:21.540 --> 42:22.872
        Professor Kern.         

42:26.411 --> 42:27.310
             Lois.              

42:28.346 --> 42:30.480
    - Did you see her face?     

42:30.482 --> 42:31.781
        Did you see it?         

42:32.918 --> 42:34.083
 - I'm worried you're in shock. 

42:34.085 --> 42:35.585
 - You need medical attention,  

42:35.587 --> 42:36.853
       and we need the          
       proper authorities       

42:36.855 --> 42:38.288
     to come and deal with      
     what's going on here.      

42:38.290 --> 42:40.890
      - We're not dealing       
      with a haunting.          

42:40.892 --> 42:41.991
           - I know.            

42:41.993 --> 42:43.226
    That's what I'm saying.     

42:43.228 --> 42:46.029
- This is a demonic infestation.

42:46.031 --> 42:49.566
      This house, Bethany,      
      it's connected.           

42:49.568 --> 42:50.466
            It's...             

42:51.236 --> 42:52.835
            strong.             

42:52.837 --> 42:55.104
    - I, I know that deep       
    down you really believe     

42:55.106 --> 42:56.506
        in these things.        

42:57.909 --> 43:00.577
   And I know I don't have      
   your years of experience,    

43:00.579 --> 43:01.811
         or your guilt.         

43:03.548 --> 43:06.482
 But what is happening in this  
 house is not supernatural.     

43:06.484 --> 43:09.118
    That doesn't make it        
    any less tragic, though.    

43:09.120 --> 43:11.955
    There is a very sick        
    young woman downstairs.     

43:11.957 --> 43:13.623
       She has already          
       suffered terribly,       

43:13.625 --> 43:15.925
       and she will only        
       hurt someone else        

43:15.927 --> 43:18.494
     or very well herself,      
     unless she is treated      

43:18.496 --> 43:20.630
   by trained professionals.    

43:20.632 --> 43:24.067
   As a medical professional    
   you can see rationally       

43:24.069 --> 43:26.970
      what needs to happen      
      in this situation.        

43:26.972 --> 43:29.872
       - You still don't        
       believe, do you?         

43:35.180 --> 43:39.549
    - In ghosts and devils      
    and the ethereal world?     

43:39.551 --> 43:40.450
              No.               

43:41.252 --> 43:43.786
    No, I'm sorry, I don't.     

43:43.788 --> 43:44.988
            I can't.            

43:44.990 --> 43:47.724
     - I agree with you         
     that she's in danger.      

43:47.726 --> 43:48.958
         Mortal danger.         

43:50.061 --> 43:51.427
   But there's nothing anyone   

43:51.429 --> 43:53.997
   from the medical             
   community can do about it.   

43:53.999 --> 43:55.832
       There's no help          
       she can be offered       

43:55.834 --> 43:58.234
  for what oppressing her now.  

44:00.505 --> 44:02.438
      - You will have to        
      forgive my inability      

44:02.440 --> 44:05.375
      to make unnecessary       
      leaps of faith,           

44:05.377 --> 44:07.777
    when there is a clearly     
    more rational answer        

44:07.779 --> 44:10.647
 sitting right in front of me.  

44:10.649 --> 44:13.416
     I will not turn a          
     blind eye to the fact      

44:13.418 --> 44:16.319
    that Bethany is a           
    clear danger to herself     

44:16.321 --> 44:18.888
      and to others, just       
      to give credence          

44:18.890 --> 44:20.156
   to some half-baked notion    

44:20.158 --> 44:22.325
     that this family's         
     problems are anything      

44:22.327 --> 44:24.661
  beyond explainable science.   

44:25.897 --> 44:28.598
       - It's gone quiet        
       now down there.          

44:28.600 --> 44:31.334
     That isn't my daughter     
     anymore, is it?            

44:31.336 --> 44:34.671
   Of course it is, Mrs.        
   Mills, please understand.    

44:34.673 --> 44:36.472
       - I know my girl.        

44:36.474 --> 44:38.441
     A mother always does.      

44:38.443 --> 44:40.276
  Whatever's in that basement,  

44:40.278 --> 44:43.613
      maybe it looks like       
      her, sounds like...       

44:44.949 --> 44:46.783
         It's not her.          

44:46.785 --> 44:48.885
       - It's still your        
       daughter, Joan.          

44:48.887 --> 44:51.621
    But it's corrupting         
    whatever's left of her.     

44:51.623 --> 44:53.823
    Soon it's going to be       
    taking over completely.     

44:53.825 --> 44:54.991
            - What?             

44:54.993 --> 44:57.560
   - Professor, please don't.   

44:57.562 --> 44:59.562
        A Gahenna demon.        

44:59.564 --> 45:03.499
   They were the most           
   feared, the first fallen,    

45:03.501 --> 45:05.935
    they'd linger where dead    
    bodies were disposed,       

45:05.937 --> 45:08.771
 where children were sacrificed 
 to Caananite deities.          

45:08.773 --> 45:12.408
   They have no desire but to   
   spread fear and suffering    

45:12.410 --> 45:15.712
 to all they encounter,         
 especially those they inhabit. 

45:15.714 --> 45:16.546
       - Then, then what?       

45:16.548 --> 45:17.447
        - Lois, please.         

45:17.449 --> 45:18.881
         - Possession.          

45:18.883 --> 45:22.452
  The demon, unable to remain   
  without dominion here,        

45:22.454 --> 45:23.720
        latches itself.         

45:23.722 --> 45:27.990
     It infects, corrupts,      
     and rots the host out      

45:27.992 --> 45:29.959
     from the inside until      
     there's nothing left.      

45:29.961 --> 45:31.194
      - This is so wrong.       

45:31.196 --> 45:33.496
- Then, what, what is it doing? 

45:33.498 --> 45:34.897
       - Stop it, you           
       are upsetting her!       

45:34.899 --> 45:36.399
      - What is it doing?       

45:36.401 --> 45:38.701
   Someone tell me what it's    
   doing to my little girl!     

45:38.703 --> 45:40.903
   - [Kern] It's killing her.   

45:40.905 --> 45:42.105
        I'm sorry, Joan.        

45:42.107 --> 45:44.907
     - No, no, don't be         
     sorry, don't be sorry!     

45:44.909 --> 45:46.008
            Help me!            

45:46.010 --> 45:46.943
          You have to!          

45:46.945 --> 45:48.411
          You have to!          

45:48.413 --> 45:50.313
  - Joan, please, Mrs. Mills,   

45:50.315 --> 45:51.948
      I understand, I do.       

45:56.254 --> 46:00.156
    My mother suffered from     
    severe mental illness.      

46:01.192 --> 46:03.559
     She spent my childhood     
     hospitalized.              

46:03.561 --> 46:07.230
      She couldn't tear         
      herself out of bed.       

46:07.232 --> 46:08.464
         That was hell.         

46:09.367 --> 46:10.600
         That was mine.         

46:12.837 --> 46:15.138
   I watched it eat away her,   

46:15.140 --> 46:18.141
   until she, she never got     
   the help that she needed.    

46:18.143 --> 46:19.675
             And I,             

46:19.677 --> 46:21.144
        promised myself.        

46:21.146 --> 46:23.212
  I promised that I would       
  have a better understanding   

46:23.214 --> 46:24.781
   of what she went through.    

46:24.783 --> 46:26.649
     I wouldn't watch one       
     more person slip away      

46:26.651 --> 46:29.619
     without getting the        
     help that they needed.     

46:29.621 --> 46:33.289
    Mrs. Mills, please, if      
    you love your daughter,     

46:33.291 --> 46:35.424
   you will let me help her.    

46:35.426 --> 46:36.325
             Today.             

46:43.168 --> 46:45.101
     - You can't stop it        
     if you don't know it.      

46:45.103 --> 46:48.604
      - Is that what            
      it's going to take?       

46:48.606 --> 46:49.872
Is that what it's going to take 

46:49.874 --> 46:51.440
      to make you both see      
      that we are dealing       

46:51.442 --> 46:53.109
      with mental illness?      

46:53.111 --> 46:54.443
    - Veronica, wait! Don't!    

46:54.445 --> 46:56.679
   - No, this ends right now.   

46:57.916 --> 47:00.750
 Mrs. Mills, call an            
 ambulance for Professor Kern.  

47:00.752 --> 47:03.319
    I am going downstairs to    
    talk to your daughter,      

47:03.321 --> 47:05.922
    and prove that there is     
    nothing more to this.       

47:05.924 --> 47:09.192
And then, I implore you, please,

47:09.194 --> 47:12.428
    don't further feed your     
    daughter's psychosis.       

47:12.430 --> 47:16.666
 We need to break the cycle     
 and get her proper treatment.  

47:18.036 --> 47:21.604
  And if neither of you will    
  do it, I will do it myself.   

47:21.606 --> 47:25.341
    - Please, if you insist     
    on going down there.        

47:27.045 --> 47:27.944
           Humor me.            

47:28.713 --> 47:30.613
     That's all I'm asking.     

47:41.359 --> 47:44.427
       - This ends when I       
       get back up here.        

48:03.281 --> 48:04.180
            Bethany?            

48:06.284 --> 48:09.952
     - Bethany can't come       
     out to play right now.     

48:13.224 --> 48:16.993
    - Bethany, Bethany,         
    it's Veronica Carpenter.    

48:16.995 --> 48:18.794
     We met the other day.      

48:19.998 --> 48:22.498
     - We know who you are.     

48:22.500 --> 48:23.566
          Disbeliever.          

48:24.836 --> 48:26.702
   We've been expecting you.    

48:26.704 --> 48:29.071
   We have something for you.   

48:29.073 --> 48:31.641
    A gift, from us to you.     

48:31.643 --> 48:32.541
           - A gift.            

48:33.344 --> 48:34.310
         What is that?          

48:34.312 --> 48:35.311
            - Faith.            

48:35.313 --> 48:36.212
            - Faith?            

48:41.185 --> 48:42.351
         - True faith.          

48:45.256 --> 48:47.256
We know you don't believe in us.

48:47.258 --> 48:50.860
     You don't want any of      
     us to be your shaman.      

48:50.862 --> 48:52.228
 You don't believe in the works 

48:52.230 --> 48:55.531
    of the filthy old drunk     
    whore upstairs, do you?     

48:55.533 --> 48:57.199
     You smell the alcohol      
     on her breath,             

48:57.201 --> 49:00.303
      and the desperation       
      in her voice.             

49:00.305 --> 49:04.240
     Disgust, that a            
     medical professional       
     could let a child die,     

49:04.242 --> 49:06.509
  and believe in fairy tales.   

49:08.846 --> 49:11.580
    Or is it something else     
    you're disbelieving?        

49:11.582 --> 49:12.481
             Look.              

49:14.319 --> 49:18.754
  Today is a day of miracles,   
  for we walk amongst you.      

49:18.756 --> 49:19.989
         - Who are you?         

49:21.192 --> 49:22.558
      You keep saying we.       

49:22.560 --> 49:24.093
       How many are you?        

49:24.095 --> 49:26.629
   - Rush rush rush, rabbit.    

49:26.631 --> 49:28.731
     First we have a favor      
     we want to ask of you.     

49:28.733 --> 49:31.734
       We want you to see       
       us, to know us,          

49:31.736 --> 49:33.769
   write our gospels for us.    

49:33.771 --> 49:35.371
   Will you be our messenger?   

49:35.373 --> 49:36.872
     - How can I do such a      
     thing if I don't know      

49:36.874 --> 49:39.575
    with whom I'm speaking?     

49:39.577 --> 49:41.444
    Am I to believe I'm         
    speaking with the devil?    

49:41.446 --> 49:43.279
     - Unh unh, try again.      

49:44.515 --> 49:46.983
 - Then, who am I speaking to?  

49:49.787 --> 49:53.155
 - (speaks in unknown language) 

49:53.157 --> 49:54.056
            Nothing.            

49:57.495 --> 49:58.761
      - Why are you here?       

49:58.763 --> 50:00.696
 - Because we wish to be free.  

50:00.698 --> 50:01.831
            - Free?             

50:01.833 --> 50:02.732
           From what?           

50:04.102 --> 50:05.534
            Gahenna.            

50:05.536 --> 50:06.435
           From hell?           

50:13.177 --> 50:16.412
     - (shrieks and gasps)      

50:27.825 --> 50:28.724
              Oh.               

50:30.161 --> 50:33.462
     You're all so pathetic     
     and human, you know.       

50:33.464 --> 50:37.533
    Hell, to use an abstract    
    concept of a mere word.     

50:38.903 --> 50:40.903
   You hear it and you          
   think fire and brimstone,    

50:40.905 --> 50:42.471
       torture, darkness.       

50:44.342 --> 50:46.976
    It's all so much worse.     

50:46.978 --> 50:50.679
  It's a continual flaying of   
  the psychic nerve endings.    

50:50.681 --> 50:54.550
   A solitude and a darkness    
   so whole and complete.       

50:54.552 --> 50:56.952
       Can you imagine          
       eternity in that?        

50:56.954 --> 51:00.756
    No, you can't fathom        
    how long an eternity is.    

51:02.860 --> 51:05.995
      There is no time or       
      matter in eternity.       

51:05.997 --> 51:07.530
      Echoes in the abyss.      

51:07.532 --> 51:11.000
     We are the unspoken        
     ones who dwell there.      

51:12.336 --> 51:15.571
  Our only respite is to cloak  
  ourselves in this flesh.      

51:15.573 --> 51:18.174
      - So if you are what      
      you say you are,          

51:18.176 --> 51:19.909
and there is such a great evil, 

51:19.911 --> 51:22.578
then there must be an opposite. 

51:23.381 --> 51:25.514
   That means there's a god.    

51:28.186 --> 51:29.385
        Is there a god?         

51:29.387 --> 51:30.286
            - Shoos!            

51:31.823 --> 51:34.590
- You didn't answer my question.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.891
        Is there a god?         

51:38.096 --> 51:42.331
      - (roars and howls        
      in unknown language)      

51:53.744 --> 51:55.244
      If you speak of the       
      great thing again         

51:55.246 --> 51:59.348
   we'll rip out your tongue    
   and feed it to you.          

51:59.350 --> 52:02.718
 - I only ask because you seem  
 to wish me to write about you. 

52:02.720 --> 52:04.420
      In which case there       
      are some questions        

52:04.422 --> 52:06.489
   that need to be answered,    
   wouldn't you agree?          

52:06.491 --> 52:08.190
     - Why do you question      
     what you don't know?       

52:08.192 --> 52:09.992
     Do you wish to know a      
     pig that sits silently     

52:09.994 --> 52:12.728
     while atrocities are       
     being committed here?      

52:12.730 --> 52:14.897
- I'll change the subject, then.

52:14.899 --> 52:16.232
 What do you want with Bethany? 

52:16.234 --> 52:17.800
     - To make her suffer.      

52:17.802 --> 52:21.837
      To make every breath      
      an indignant agony.       

52:21.839 --> 52:22.671
           - But why?           

52:22.673 --> 52:24.406
       - Because we can.        

52:24.408 --> 52:27.409
  Because she let us in here.   

52:27.411 --> 52:29.278
- [Bethany] No, no no, I didn't.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.846
       I didn't, I swear.       

52:31.716 --> 52:34.283
 - [Demons] Shut up, you bitch! 

52:36.254 --> 52:39.021
    She let us in, when she     
    was by the roadside,        

52:39.023 --> 52:42.358
    bleeding to death,          
    drifting into darkness.     

52:42.360 --> 52:43.926
      It didn't take much.      

52:43.928 --> 52:46.729
  When confronted with          
  darkness, you will question,  

52:46.731 --> 52:48.364
       argue and barter.        

52:48.366 --> 52:50.533
     Consequence be damned.     

52:50.535 --> 52:51.667
    So we made her an offer.    

52:51.669 --> 52:52.835
     We would restore her,      

52:52.837 --> 52:56.405
    as long as we were          
    allowed to hitch a ride.    

52:58.342 --> 52:59.942
      So now here we are.       

52:59.944 --> 53:01.744
  - So you tricked her, then.   

53:01.746 --> 53:04.880
 - No, she let us in willingly! 

53:04.882 --> 53:06.348
       Why is it you all        
       are so unwilling         

53:06.350 --> 53:08.684
      to admit your flaws       
      and weaknesses?           

53:08.686 --> 53:11.820
   Sins, carry them around      
   like you're full of fear,    

53:11.822 --> 53:13.389
or lies that you tell everyone. 

53:13.391 --> 53:14.790
        Tell yourselves.        

53:23.668 --> 53:25.000
   - [Bethany] He touched me.   

53:25.002 --> 53:27.169
      I never told anyone,      
      but it's true.            

53:27.171 --> 53:28.837
      He touched me in...       

53:32.210 --> 53:33.542
           Bad ways.            

53:33.544 --> 53:35.010
           - Bethany.           

53:35.012 --> 53:36.245
   - [Bethany] My protector.    

53:36.247 --> 53:37.846
      He came in at night,      

53:37.848 --> 53:39.949
      and he held me down.      

53:39.951 --> 53:41.584
       And he did things.       

53:41.586 --> 53:43.152
         - Your father?         

53:43.154 --> 53:45.054
     What did he do to you?     

53:45.056 --> 53:47.189
   - [Demons] He fucked her!    

53:49.393 --> 53:51.026
      So, uh, that's all.       

53:55.166 --> 53:58.567
      There's not an inch       
      that he didn't lick.      

54:03.040 --> 54:05.874
      Not a crevasse            
      that he didn't, ah.       

54:09.113 --> 54:11.247
     The old bitch upstairs     
     knew all about it.         

54:11.249 --> 54:13.549
      She pretended to be       
      asleep every night.       

54:13.551 --> 54:15.484
      She just denied it.       

54:15.486 --> 54:17.586
 And she blamed her own child.  

54:17.588 --> 54:19.722
   She blamed her own child!    

54:22.260 --> 54:24.059
     - How do I know you're     
     telling the truth?         

54:24.061 --> 54:25.828
     - Because you know it.     

54:25.830 --> 54:27.062
            - Do I?             

54:27.064 --> 54:30.032
      You could very            
      easily be lying, or       

54:30.034 --> 54:31.467
   manipulating half-truths.    

54:31.469 --> 54:33.869
  - We have no reason to lie.   

54:33.871 --> 54:35.771
     The truth cuts deeper.     

54:36.607 --> 54:38.774
      We know all secrets.      

54:38.776 --> 54:40.876
     Even yours, Veronica.      

54:40.878 --> 54:43.946
      Oh, you're ripe           
      with fear and doubt.      

54:45.316 --> 54:46.715
        It shouts to us.        

54:47.585 --> 54:48.917
        Sings choruses.         

54:50.354 --> 54:53.489
     You don't want the         
     child you're bearing.      

54:53.491 --> 54:54.690
       Useless, incon...        

54:54.692 --> 54:56.859
            (grunts)            

54:58.829 --> 55:00.262
        Do you hate it?         

55:00.264 --> 55:02.231
    Or are you just afraid?     

55:03.801 --> 55:07.670
 Incapable of loving it like    
 your mother wasn't loving you. 

55:07.672 --> 55:10.039
   - You don't know anything.   

55:10.041 --> 55:10.939
            - Maybe.            

55:12.543 --> 55:15.077
    She's in hell, you know.    

55:15.079 --> 55:16.245
          Your mother.          

55:16.247 --> 55:18.113
         She's in hell.         

55:18.115 --> 55:19.014
            With us.            

55:20.551 --> 55:23.819
     - I don't know what        
     you're talking about.      

55:23.821 --> 55:26.722
      - She slit her            
      wrists, didn't she?       

55:28.159 --> 55:29.725
       Oh, foolish bitch.       

55:30.628 --> 55:31.827
       And now she burns.       

55:31.829 --> 55:33.228
        Now she suffers.        

55:34.932 --> 55:36.765
 - [Veronica's Mother] Please,  
 please, I'm in so much pain,   

55:36.767 --> 55:38.834
    please Veronica, please!    

55:42.506 --> 55:45.307
      - [Demons] She cries      
      in the darkness.          

55:45.309 --> 55:48.744
       Agonizing daily          
       as we torment her.       

55:48.746 --> 55:51.313
    As we tear the flesh        
    hungrily from her bones,    

55:51.315 --> 55:52.147
            gnawing.            

55:52.149 --> 55:54.550
          (hard slap)           

55:58.189 --> 55:59.154
          My, my, my.           

56:01.625 --> 56:04.193
 What have we done now now now. 

56:05.629 --> 56:07.296
        All those years,        

56:07.298 --> 56:09.798
     wasted, trying to save     
     her through others         

56:09.800 --> 56:12.568
 though you know you never can. 

56:12.570 --> 56:15.003
 She'll always be in that tub,  

56:15.005 --> 56:19.208
  bleeding out, trying to       
  escape this world, and you.   

56:19.210 --> 56:21.076
    It was too much for her.    

56:21.078 --> 56:22.211
         All over you.          

56:25.416 --> 56:27.950
   - You don't know anything    
   about me or my family.       

56:27.952 --> 56:30.119
   - Oh, we know everything.    

56:31.622 --> 56:34.957
 Why you cannot attach          
 yourself to this small being.  

56:34.959 --> 56:38.527
     You fear the darkness      
     in her rests in you.       

56:40.664 --> 56:43.198
     Some day it will be        
     too much for you too.      

56:43.200 --> 56:45.768
      You'll give up, lose      
      your desire to live       

56:45.770 --> 56:47.870
     and you'll end up          
     alone in the darkness.     

56:47.872 --> 56:49.138
        Alone, with us.         

56:49.140 --> 56:50.572
           Like her.            

56:50.574 --> 56:52.007
         - You're sick.         

56:52.009 --> 56:55.144
      You are sick and          
      you're full of shit!      

56:56.280 --> 56:59.348
       - [Demons] Do you        
       miss me, Veronica?       

56:59.350 --> 57:00.249
           We all do.           

57:08.759 --> 57:12.094
     (haunting vocal music)     

57:29.780 --> 57:30.679
           - Bethany.           

57:35.052 --> 57:35.884
            (gasps)             

57:35.886 --> 57:39.054
      - [Demons] (roaring)      

57:40.424 --> 57:44.293
  Don't fight it, we will help  
  you through lack of faith.    

57:44.295 --> 57:47.529
      Let us show you, let      
      us in, let us in.         

57:52.436 --> 57:53.335
           Let us in!           

57:55.439 --> 57:58.173
        (howls in pain)         

58:00.344 --> 58:03.579
      She is ours, we will      
      never let her go!         

58:04.381 --> 58:06.515
   Rotten curse on your womb!   

58:10.621 --> 58:12.521
     - [Joan] Are you okay?     

58:13.791 --> 58:14.723
             What?              

58:14.725 --> 58:15.724
             What?              

58:15.726 --> 58:16.959
          - I'm sorry.          

58:16.961 --> 58:18.193
         I have to go.          

58:18.195 --> 58:19.461
    - You have to, but, but.    

58:19.463 --> 58:22.698
      Wait, she's gonna be      
      alright, isn't she?       

58:26.971 --> 58:28.537
      You can do something      
      to help her, yeah?        

58:28.539 --> 58:29.438
            Please!             

58:39.350 --> 58:40.315
          - Veronica,           

58:43.020 --> 58:45.320
  you saw it now, didn't you?   

58:57.134 --> 59:01.370
 I know what it's like when the 
 darkness looks back into us.   

59:07.077 --> 59:10.913
       Given years hoping       
       it was in my head.       

59:10.915 --> 59:12.147
         But it's back.         

59:15.452 --> 59:19.688
  And I can't watch this        
  again, not without fighting.  

59:21.225 --> 59:23.725
 And we can stop it this time.  

59:28.032 --> 59:28.931
           - I can't.           

59:30.434 --> 59:32.067
      I'm sorry, I just...      

59:32.069 --> 59:33.569
       - Veronica, wait!        

59:35.472 --> 59:36.371
           Veronica.            

59:38.943 --> 59:41.677
        (quiet singing)         

59:59.897 --> 01:00:02.197
           (growling)           

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.903
           (laughing)           

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.678
      (quiet piano music)       

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:24.246
    - Are you ready to come     
    play with us again?         

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:25.847
 We've been waiting a long time 

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.684
       for you to come          
       and play with us.        

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:56.945
   - You're not in this room.   

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:01.349
      - We had ever so          
      much fun last time.       

01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:08.390
     - I'm not going to         
     let you do this again.     

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.659
       - We can wait as         
       long as it takes.        

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:13.061
      Forever, if need be.      

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.298
And it'll still be us, and you. 

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.100
     In the dark together.      

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:22.304
We have so many things planned. 

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.109
           - No more.           

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.947
I'm going to stop you this time.

01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:34.149
        Do you hear me?         

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.051
     I'm going to stop you.     

01:02:38.689 --> 01:02:42.357
     - We've been waiting       
     for you, little sheep.     

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.630
  - [Unseen Voice] We've been   
  waiting for you, Veronica.    

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.832
    Waiting for your child.     

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:54.069
     We all are, and            
     you'll never get away.     

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:07.949
     - Please, please,          
     please don't hang up.      

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.785
     Please don't hang up.      

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.658
      - [Veronica] Thanks       
      for meeting me.           

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.727
       - Hey, no problem.       

01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:21.797
     You sounded pretty         
     wrecked on the phone.      

01:03:21.799 --> 01:03:23.965
  I'm just starting to think    
  this isn't about our fight.   

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.133
         Or us at all.          

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:27.502
        What's going on?        

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:32.073
     - I don't know, uh...      

01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:33.542
           I think...           

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:36.211
I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:39.881
    I'm sorry, I don't know     
    why I'm doing this.         

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:42.384
     I, you know me right.      

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:45.754
      You know I always         
      try to be, rational.      

01:03:45.756 --> 01:03:48.390
   And understanding, and...    

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:50.292
   These last few days I        
   have seen and felt things    

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:52.494
       that I don't know        
       how to explain.          

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.562
     - With the professor?      

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:55.564
    - I'm not crazy, right?     

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:57.999
        I'm not my Mom?         

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.234
            - Whoa!             

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:01.036
     - I know it's real,        
     and I know it's true.      

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:02.103
    - Of course, of course.     

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:03.738
      Hey, hey, I'm here.       

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:06.208
      I'm here now, okay?       

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.510
  You can tell me what it is.   

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.681
        - I'm pregnant.         

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:15.383
          - Pregnant?           

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.691
    How long have you known?    

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:23.725
 - I don't know, maybe a week.  

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:28.163
               I,               

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.430
     I guess I knew before      
     that but I just            

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.799
      confirmed it, so...       

01:04:30.801 --> 01:04:33.101
     - Do you know what         
     you want to do, or...      

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.836
  - I don't want to hurt you.   

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:35.904
          - You can't.          

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:38.540
           You won't.           

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:39.808
  You're not alone, you know?   

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.810
 We can work this out together. 

01:04:41.812 --> 01:04:44.112
      Whatever you decide,      
      I'm with you.             

01:04:44.114 --> 01:04:45.247
         I'm with you.          

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.950
         (phone rings)          

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:50.452
             Shit.              

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:53.421
     I have shoots with         
     clients in 40 minutes.     

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.323
        I'll cancel it.         

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:56.892
 - That's fine, you should go.  

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:58.426
       - [Buckley] No,          
       this is important.       

01:04:58.428 --> 01:04:59.427
        - No, it's fine.        

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:00.962
    Buckley, you should go.     

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:01.963
          - You sure?           

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:07.369
    We can talk about this.     

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:08.270
             Okay?              

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:26.454
           (growling)           

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.327
   - We want you now, cheff.    

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.868
     You'll never get away.     

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.037
   You're ours, you're ours!    

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:55.817
      (cell phone chimes)       

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.466
       - [Kern] Veronica?       

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.469
         Are you there?         

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.370
             - Yes.             

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.374
       - [Kern] You know        
       what it really is.       

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:20.575
    What we're dealing with?    

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:21.476
           It's evil.           

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:23.311
           True evil.           

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:26.614
             - Yes.             

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:32.654
   - [Kern] Do you know now     
   you can't just walk away?    

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:35.724
           Veronica?            

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:39.327
             - Yes.             

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:47.802
       How do we stop it?       

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:53.475
  - This is all I could find.   

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:55.143
     - It'll work, thanks.      

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:57.912
    In ancient times, salt      
    was used to consecrate,     

01:06:57.914 --> 01:06:59.481
       and ward off evil.       

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:01.649
     We can hopefully           
     contain it long enough     

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.852
    to complete the ritual.     

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:07.522
    Jacob's exorcist left       
    this to me when he died.    

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:10.291
  It's very old, very special.  

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:12.560
     Talisman meant to bind     
     and banish a demon         

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:14.129
       back into the pit.       

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:17.632
     Its elements are rare.     

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.169
       And it's blessed.        

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:24.339
  But understand, our combined  
  faith and strength alone      

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:25.907
is going to defeat this entity. 

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:27.642
 Without that, we have nothing. 

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:29.644
     Now whatever you hear,     
     whatever happens,          

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:31.780
 I need you to remain upstairs. 

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:34.549
   Once we start, we can't      
   stop until it's finished.    

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.520
  It'll become more reckless,   
  defensive, and violent.       

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:41.156
Stop at nothing to remain here. 

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:45.660
             Faith.             

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.709
            - Wait.             

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:05.146
     I have something I         
     want to show you both.     

01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:09.084
          My sunshine.          

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:12.754
       I was so scared          
       when she was born.       

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:15.690
  Loving something that much.   

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.492
     Beyond even yourself.      

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:20.795
         I failed her.          

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.334
 I've made mistakes in my life. 

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.470
   Maybe this is punishment.    

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.840
      I don't know if I         
      deserve forgiveness,      

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.475
    but my baby's innocent.     

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:38.212
Whatever's in that basement,    
it thinks that it can break me. 

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:40.715
 Take the love I have for her.  

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:44.685
It has no idea how strong a bond

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.555
between a mother and her child. 

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.992
        It has no idea.         

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:56.064
    Now, you go down there,     

01:08:57.334 --> 01:09:00.268
      and you bring me          
      back my little girl.      

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.435
         You save her.          

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:13.314
   - I need to know you're      
   gonna be okay down there.    

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:15.984
         - I am scared.         

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:21.421
           - Me too.            

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:27.395
    But it's the only time      
    we ever get to be brave.    

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:44.078
  - [Bethany] Here we are now.  

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.846
         Entertain us.          

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:46.915
         - That smell!          

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:48.649
      - Sulfur, ignore it.      

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:53.020
       - [Demons] You're        
       not going to win.        

01:09:57.427 --> 01:10:00.995
        (demons screech)        

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:04.566
   (demons speak in tongues)    

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:10.972
- By the powers, principalities,
thrones and dominions,          

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:11.973
          I bind you.           

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:16.711
 By the powers, principalities, 
 thrones and dominions,         

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:17.712
          I bind you.           

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:22.984
 By the powers, principalities, 
 thrones and dominions,         

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:23.952
          I bind you.           

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:31.893
     - You were always          
     such a disappointment.     

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.529
  You break the circle, bitch.  

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:38.766
You break it now, or it's       
gonna be so much worse for you. 

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.707
  I will drag you kicking       
  and screaming into the pit,   

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:48.142
    and stuff your mouth        
    with your own excrement.    

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.578
     You can't win, bitch.      

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.213
You couldn't save little Jacob, 

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.015
    and you can't save her.     

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.216
          She is ours.          

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:56.384
          You hear me?          

01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:57.285
            Shut up!            

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.021
      You'll have nothing!      

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.489
            Nothing!            

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.124
       This is where you        
       put your faith?          

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.826
        This old bitch?         

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:06.928
She couldn't save little Jacob. 

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.330
  Oh, we did play with him so.  

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.269
   After he did his vile acts   
   and carved into himself?     

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:16.437
      We stayed forever         
      and dropped the fear      

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:19.741
       as we threw him in       
       front of that car.       

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:21.643
     We want Jacob's bones!     

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:24.746
      - Lois, the circle!       

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:28.816
        - How dare you.         

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:32.854
         How dare you!          

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:52.006
           (screams)            

01:12:01.251 --> 01:12:04.485
     Stay with me forever,      
     or leave me now!           

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:13.428
     And you're wimping out     

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:17.332
      if you don't shove        
      it down your throat.      

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:18.232
            - Stop!             

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:20.368
            Bethany!            

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.870
    You let her go right        
    now, you son of a bitch!    

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:24.405
  You leave my daughter alone!  

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:25.940
       - Wait your turn!        

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:27.575
 We have special plans for you, 

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:29.444
      you deceitful bitch.      

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:31.145
        - Baby, please.         

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:32.914
      I know you're there.      

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.916
   I know you're still there.   

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.718
       Baby, please, I          
       know you're there.       

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.020
           (growling)           

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.223
Bethany, I know you're in there.

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:45.059
     I know you're in           
     there, and I'm sorry.      

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.328
       I'm sorry for what       
       happened to you.         

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.930
    For what he did to you.     

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:50.865
   I'm sorry, I didn't know.    

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:51.766
            - Liar!             

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:57.438
        - I didn't know!        

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.339
           I'm sorry.           

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:01.876
  I should have protected you!  

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:02.777
            - Lies!             

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:06.180
   Everything, you knew         
   everything he did to her,    

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:07.715
      and you did nothing.      

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:08.883
            Nothing!            

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:09.784
            You pig!            

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:14.088
- I know you're still in there. 

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.989
           I know it.           

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.059
    I know you're fighting.     

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:22.029
      And I'm not going to      
      leave you this time.      

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:24.432
  I am not going to leave you.  

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:29.237
          - You bitch!          

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:33.541
  - I won't let you be alone.   

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:40.014
   - Your daughter can see      
   and feel everything we do    

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.516
         in this body.          

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:45.520
   And we are going to rip      
   you apart piece by piece.    

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:53.127
 - I'm not going to leave you.  

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.039
       - [Bethany] Mama?        

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:14.248
       - Bethany, fight!        

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.082
       (demons shrieking)       

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:16.284
         - [Demons] No!         

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:18.019
      She is, she is ours!      

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:20.488
             Ours!              

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:25.860
  - [Kern] (chanting in Latin)  

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:57.692
     - Ah, no, no, no, no.      

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:03.264
       - She's free now.        

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.668
    - It's okay, it's okay.     

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.403
         You saved her.         

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:10.238
         You took a...          

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.639
        You, you did it.        

01:15:18.448 --> 01:15:19.780
        - It knows you.         

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:43.204
           (sobbing)            

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.642
  - [Veronica] We tell stories  
  and try to rationalize        

01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:50.144
the darkness that surrounds us, 

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:53.014
     and name the kind          
     that dwells within us.     

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:54.949
       But for all of our       
       collective fears         

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:57.118
      of the unknown            
      evils that lay just       

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.220
outside the harsh light of day, 

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.789
      perhaps our greatest      
      fear is merely            

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:05.626
  to acknowledge the darkness   
  capable in our own hearts.    

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:06.794
         Our own sins.          

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:08.262
     We're afraid to see it     

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:09.497
          to touch it,          

01:16:09.499 --> 01:16:11.399
       terrified that it        
       will consume us.         

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:12.500
         Or, perhaps...         

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:15.136
         (phone chimes)         

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:44.198
   Perhaps we are afraid that   
   if we see the darkness,      

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:50.271
      it will then see us.      

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:58.813
          (baby cries)          

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:45.226
(demons growling and clamoring) 

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:56.937
      ¶The sunshine comes       
      through the rain¶         

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:04.311
    ¶I'll be your blue sky¶     

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:08.816
    ¶And take all your pain¶    

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:17.024
 ¶Waiting for the sun to rise¶  

01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:24.365
   ¶I will never be the same¶   

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:29.270
    ¶Without you by my side¶    

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:33.407
     ¶You are my sunshine¶      

01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:38.079
     ¶Cut through the rain¶     

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:43.117
    ¶I'll be your blue sky¶     

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:47.621
      ¶Take all your pain¶      

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:53.828
     ¶Rain is falling down¶     

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:03.404
 ¶The sun will dry your tears¶  

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:11.645
      ¶Don't you know           
      you are my sunshine¶      

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:16.450
     ¶Cut through the rain¶     

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:21.355
    ¶I'll be your blue sky¶     

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:26.160
    ¶And take all your pain¶    

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.407
     ¶You are my sunshine¶      

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:44.879
     ¶Cut through the rain¶     

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:49.784

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.421
    ¶And take all your pain¶    

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:59.059
     ¶You are my sunshine¶

     ¶Cut through the rain¶

     ¶Cut through the rain¶
