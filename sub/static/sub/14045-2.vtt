WEBVTT

00:02.222 --> 00:03.950
- So, about Jordan.
- Ah, don't worry.

00:03.983 --> 00:05.174
We're just taking it one day at a time.

00:05.198 --> 00:06.446
No, I-I don't care about that.

00:06.479 --> 00:08.567
I just want to know if she
plans on taking this job back.

00:08.591 --> 00:09.645
Oh, I don't know.

00:09.678 --> 00:11.382
I mean, I know she prefers
looking after patients

00:11.406 --> 00:13.366
than running the night shift,
but she likes being in charge.

00:13.390 --> 00:15.181
Wait, no. You want the job.

00:15.214 --> 00:17.741
- You're starting a coup.
- No, hey, I'm not starting a coup.

00:17.774 --> 00:19.149
I hated the job at first, but

00:19.182 --> 00:21.293
Janet wants to stay home with the twins,

00:21.326 --> 00:23.853
and I think this would make that possible.

00:23.886 --> 00:25.526
You're starting a...
you're starting a coup.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.798
- No, okay, stop. Please stop saying that.
- Starting a coup.

00:27.822 --> 00:29.005
Okay.

00:29.038 --> 00:30.252
Well, look, just ask her.

00:30.286 --> 00:32.269
Well, you know, I-I don't
want it to get weird

00:32.301 --> 00:34.765
between me and her, so I was
hoping that you could ask her,

00:34.798 --> 00:36.461
- that way if she wants...
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!

00:36.493 --> 00:38.230
- I'm not getting in between you two.
- Help! Help me!

00:38.254 --> 00:39.660
- Good luck with that.
- My wife!

00:39.694 --> 00:40.917
- Help me!
- I need a gurney here!

00:40.941 --> 00:42.613
- Please! I need some help!
- Okay, what happened?

00:42.637 --> 00:44.556
A couple weeks ago, I
had some cattle stolen,

00:44.590 --> 00:46.252
so when I heard a noise in the barn...

00:46.285 --> 00:48.044
- So you shot her?
- It was an accident!

00:48.077 --> 00:49.526
She was supposed to be at her book club.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.253
I didn't mean to shoot
her. She came home early.

00:51.277 --> 00:52.629
- All right, what's her name?
- Melissa.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.156
Okay, sir, I need you to stay here.

00:54.190 --> 00:55.405
Sir, stay here.

00:55.437 --> 00:57.772
Kenny, I need two large-bore
IVs, and let's unbundle her.

00:57.805 --> 00:59.819
- Paul, come on.
- Sats are only at 84%.

00:59.853 --> 01:01.676
Okay. All right, Melissa. Can you hear me?

01:01.708 --> 01:03.436
Everything is gonna be all right, okay?

01:03.469 --> 01:05.739
Your husband's outside. He's
waiting to take you home.

01:05.772 --> 01:07.628
We just need to fix you up a little bit.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.556
But first, I need you to
fight with me, all right?

01:09.580 --> 01:11.051
- It was a good book.
- Yeah?

01:11.085 --> 01:12.236
"The Great Gatsby."

01:12.268 --> 01:14.475
Oh, tell me all about
it. Keep talking to me.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.308
- I've never seen it.
- Better than the movie.

01:16.332 --> 01:17.844
I think we got a GSW to the left chest.

01:17.868 --> 01:20.020
Kenny, open a chest tube tray
and prep for a thoracotomy.

01:20.044 --> 01:22.124
No breath sounds on the left side.

01:22.156 --> 01:23.307
Uh, collapsed lung, right?

01:23.340 --> 01:24.363
No, worse.

01:24.396 --> 01:25.739
We got a tension pneumothorax.

01:25.773 --> 01:27.828
Okay, we got a... a shifted
trachea and extended neck vein.

01:27.852 --> 01:29.483
- 10 blade.
- Yep.

01:29.516 --> 01:31.060
- Set up for intubation.
- I can't feel a pulse.

01:31.084 --> 01:32.683
- It was an accident!
- Kenny! Kenny.

01:32.715 --> 01:34.451
- Get him out of here.
- Sir! I know. Sir, sir.

01:34.475 --> 01:36.362
You have to wait outside. I know. I know.

01:36.395 --> 01:38.251
I'm sorry, baby! I'm so sorry!

01:39.275 --> 01:41.323
- Oh! There you are. Hey.
- Hey.

01:41.355 --> 01:42.507
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.394
We have a pancreatic
tumor with our name on it.

01:44.427 --> 01:45.770
Pancreaticoduodenectomy?

01:45.803 --> 01:48.043
Yeah. But we just call it a whipple.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.762
But I love your enthusiasm.
See you in 30 minutes?

01:50.795 --> 01:51.827
Yeah, I'll grab us a couple coffees.

01:51.851 --> 01:53.867
What's going on?

01:53.899 --> 01:55.338
Um, come here.

01:55.371 --> 01:58.730
Husband accidentally shot his wife.

01:58.764 --> 02:00.179
Well, if anyone can save her, it's TC.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.026
Oh, don't put that kind of pressure on him!

02:02.059 --> 02:03.658
He already does enough of that himself.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.161
Why are you here on your night off?

02:05.194 --> 02:06.570
Signed up for vet duty.

02:06.603 --> 02:08.649
Oh. Aren't you dedicated?

02:08.683 --> 02:10.451
To be honest, I was just
itching to get out of the house.

02:10.475 --> 02:11.594
You and Rick are still...

02:11.627 --> 02:13.258
Yeah, it's just... tough right now.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.889
I mean, It's just wearing me down

02:14.923 --> 02:16.713
because he's so negative all the time,

02:16.747 --> 02:18.474
- and it's just hard to be around.
- Mm.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.809
And, I mean, I get it, but it's just tough.

02:20.843 --> 02:24.157
You can't blame the guy. I mean, my back
pain... it makes me want to punch somebody.

02:24.181 --> 02:26.729
I can't imagine if I lost my leg.

02:26.762 --> 02:28.041
Me neither.

02:28.075 --> 02:30.121
He just needs to see a
specialist at The Intrepid.

02:30.154 --> 02:31.657
And then everything will be better

02:31.689 --> 02:33.801
once he gets his new
prosthetic and he starts rehab.

02:33.834 --> 02:35.953
- When's that?
- Ain't that the million-dollar question?

02:35.977 --> 02:38.856
We're waiting on a referral from
this Dr. Anderson at the VA.

02:38.889 --> 02:41.001
Could be tomorrow, could be when pigs fly.

02:41.034 --> 02:42.281
<i>- Code Blue.</i>
- Ay.

02:42.314 --> 02:44.009
<i>Dr. Alexander, Trauma 2. Code Blue.</i>

02:44.042 --> 02:45.993
<i>Dr. Alexander, Trauma 2.</i>

02:48.361 --> 02:50.601
Do it. Good. I need
another set of hands.

02:50.633 --> 02:52.552
Where are you?

02:52.585 --> 02:55.241
Three units of blood, five
internal defibrillations,

02:55.273 --> 02:57.105
four rounds of epi, two
bicarb, still no response.

02:57.129 --> 02:59.785
- No cardiac activity?
- Not for the last 15 minutes.

02:59.817 --> 03:02.504
I'm repairing the ventricle now.
If we could just clamp the...

03:02.537 --> 03:03.944
- The aorta.
- Yeah.

03:04.968 --> 03:06.856
The ventricle's shredded.

03:06.888 --> 03:08.488
Clamp across the artery.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.504
There.

03:10.536 --> 03:11.720
All right. Clamp is on.

03:11.753 --> 03:13.096
It's not working.

03:13.129 --> 03:14.129
And I'm done.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.088
Tee, still no cardiac activity.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.912
No, no, no, no, no. Okay, paddles.

03:19.944 --> 03:21.799
I need two more units
of blood. Okay, clear.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.719
Clear.

03:23.753 --> 03:26.055
Okay, good, I need saline wide open.

03:26.088 --> 03:27.761
I need five units of epi. I'm gonna
put it straight into her heart.

03:27.785 --> 03:29.800
I need 40 more units of vasopressin. Okay?

03:29.832 --> 03:32.327
- TC.
- The paddles again! Paddles again!

03:32.360 --> 03:34.215
Clear.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.646
- Come on, come on, come on. Come on!
- TC.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.975
She's gone. You need to call it.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.206
19:05.

03:52.679 --> 03:54.214
That was brutal.

03:54.246 --> 03:56.006
He hasn't lost anyone in a long time.

03:57.511 --> 03:59.910
I'm sorry.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.327 --> 04:14.278
Hey.

04:15.654 --> 04:16.805
Tee.

04:17.926 --> 04:19.430
You want some company?

04:27.238 --> 04:28.325
You okay?

04:33.702 --> 04:37.094
I've seen a lot of people die.

04:37.126 --> 04:38.948
You know, and...

04:38.982 --> 04:43.652
You never get used to it,
but you learn to deal with it.

04:43.685 --> 04:47.557
Tee, you did everything that you could.

04:47.589 --> 04:49.029
See, if I did everything I could,

04:49.062 --> 04:50.183
then I would have saved her.

04:50.213 --> 04:53.092
You see the look on her husband's face?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.404
Being responsible for
somebody else's death...

04:58.437 --> 04:59.749
Hey. We just got a call.

04:59.782 --> 05:01.397
Uh, ranch party outside of Yoakum.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.013
High school kids, booze, and drugs.

05:03.045 --> 05:04.196
Multiple injuries.

05:04.229 --> 05:05.444
Paramedics just arrived,

05:05.477 --> 05:07.652
and Gwen says there's one
patient she can't move.

05:07.685 --> 05:08.741
She asked for you, Tee.

05:08.773 --> 05:10.500
I'm on it.

05:12.484 --> 05:13.081
All right?

05:13.106 --> 05:14.275
- Wait.
- Yeah.

05:14.308 --> 05:16.195
Hey, Tee.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.084
Look, remember, you can only do your best.

05:18.116 --> 05:19.556
Let's hope it's good enough.

05:23.301 --> 05:25.252
Hey, look.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.635
Can you...

05:29.668 --> 05:32.388
Well, we should probably
see what that's all about.

05:32.421 --> 05:33.700
Gurney!

05:33.732 --> 05:35.811
Over here! This way!

05:38.308 --> 05:39.971
That's good.

05:40.004 --> 05:41.699
TC, follow me.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.172
All right, two kids pile onto
the ATV, tried to outrun the cops.

05:44.196 --> 05:46.563
Driver lost control and
ran into the barbed wire.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.131
Didn't know what to do.

05:48.163 --> 05:50.540
I figured he must have seen
something like this in Afghanistan.

05:50.564 --> 05:51.810
Aah!

05:51.843 --> 05:53.484
I did see something
like this in Afghanistan.

05:53.508 --> 05:55.267
Didn't end well.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.068
All right, we need to get
this barbed wire out of him,

05:57.092 --> 05:58.288
or he's gonna bleed out.

06:16.587 --> 06:18.584
Can I get an officer to move
these kids out of here, please?

06:18.608 --> 06:20.673
Everybody back up a little bit. Back up.

06:20.706 --> 06:22.547
Some bolt cutters. Cut
most of these barbs out.

06:22.574 --> 06:25.196
I could pull the wire trimmer
and save the small bowel.

06:25.229 --> 06:28.236
Oh, my God!
What happened to Brian?!

06:28.269 --> 06:30.732
Ladies, I need you to step
back and sit down, all right?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.237
Just move back. Thank you.

06:32.269 --> 06:33.597
Okay. TC, the IV is in.

06:33.630 --> 06:34.890
- Thanks, Gwen.
- Aah!

06:34.924 --> 06:36.941
So, buddy, what's your names?

06:37.232 --> 06:38.456
Terrence, and... and that's Brian.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.911
Good. Terrence, can you,
uh, hold that IV for me?

06:40.944 --> 06:43.023
Uh, o-okay.

06:43.057 --> 06:45.040
We took off when the cops got here.

06:45.074 --> 06:47.023
I swerved when I saw the barbed wire,

06:47.056 --> 06:48.720
but Brian flew straight into it.

06:48.752 --> 06:49.944
Let me take a look at that shoulder.

06:49.968 --> 06:51.639
- I think you dislocated it.
- No, I don't even feel it.

06:51.663 --> 06:54.031
- Just fix my friend, all right?
- Aah!

06:54.064 --> 06:56.527
How long have you guys been
buddies? Tell me about it.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.840
We've been playing ball together
since we were like 8 years old.

06:58.864 --> 07:01.679
Coach from Arizona state came
by to watch us play tonight.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.343
Yeah? How'd it go?

07:03.376 --> 07:04.942
He offered us both scholarships.

07:04.976 --> 07:07.599
All we ever wanted was to
play ball in college together,

07:07.631 --> 07:08.559
and now I messed it up.

07:08.591 --> 07:10.062
Gwen, I need some irrigation.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.302
Hey, buddy, buddy. I know it hurts.
I know, okay?

07:12.335 --> 07:14.062
But you're tough as nails, all right?

07:14.095 --> 07:15.406
I know you are.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.070
Okay, push another five of morphine.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.127
I'm on it.

07:18.159 --> 07:19.598
All right, Brian.

07:19.631 --> 07:21.110
This is gonna help.
You're doing great, okay?

07:21.134 --> 07:22.510
Doing great, Brian.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.782
Brian?

07:24.815 --> 07:26.798
Okay, he's out.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.718
So, this guy in Afghanistan
worse than this?

07:28.750 --> 07:29.869
He's different.

07:29.902 --> 07:31.502
About the same age as this kid,

07:31.535 --> 07:33.901
except he had a few live RPGs in his gut.

07:33.935 --> 07:35.661
Oh, my God.

07:35.695 --> 07:37.422
You want to know what he said to me?

07:37.454 --> 07:39.725
He said he was sorry for
getting me in this mess.

07:39.758 --> 07:41.421
He was afraid of getting <i>me</i> killed.

07:41.455 --> 07:43.086
You must have been scared to death.

07:43.118 --> 07:47.341
Well, actually, I was thinking,
"this, uh, this thing goes off,

07:47.375 --> 07:50.125
there'd be nothing left of me to
send home to Jordan and my mom."

07:51.406 --> 07:53.261
You're lucky it didn't go off.

07:53.294 --> 07:55.853
No, no, it did. It did.

07:55.885 --> 07:58.893
I stepped away for about 10
seconds to talk with Topher.

07:58.926 --> 08:00.557
He was gonna help me take the RPG out.

08:00.589 --> 08:04.428
Lenny Ross. Nice kid from Philly.

08:04.461 --> 08:08.364
I can still see the,
uh, pimples on his chin.

08:08.398 --> 08:10.796
Hey, look. There's no RPG here, right?

08:10.829 --> 08:13.837
Get another five of morphine ready.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.948
Standing by.

08:15.981 --> 08:17.356
- Topher!
- Yeah?

08:17.389 --> 08:18.572
Hey.

08:18.606 --> 08:20.204
Finished all your paperwork.

08:20.237 --> 08:23.308
Hey, any chance I get to work
on some actual patients tonight?

08:23.341 --> 08:25.196
You know I'm not just a secretary.

08:25.229 --> 08:26.796
I do have four years of med school.

08:26.829 --> 08:28.940
I know. I know. You remind
us every chance you get.

08:28.973 --> 08:30.636
I will get you some patients,

08:30.669 --> 08:32.587
but first, I-I lost my therastrap.

08:32.621 --> 08:36.364
Could you find one for
me? I need a number 10.

08:36.397 --> 08:37.580
Therastrap.

08:37.613 --> 08:40.299
What? Didn't study that in
your four years of med school?

08:40.332 --> 08:42.379
- Never mind. Hey, Mollie.
- Yeah?

08:42.412 --> 08:44.235
I need a number 10 therastrap for my back.

08:44.268 --> 08:45.195
Oh, okay.

08:45.228 --> 08:46.356
No, no, no, no. I g... I got it.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.171
I'll get it. Therastrap.

08:48.204 --> 08:49.579
Cool. Coming right up.

08:49.613 --> 08:50.539
Thanks.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.819
Therastrap, huh?

08:51.852 --> 08:53.739
It almost sounds like a real thing.

08:53.772 --> 08:55.813
Just getting him back for all
those years of torturing us.

08:55.837 --> 08:56.331
Thank you.

08:56.363 --> 08:59.275
You got to break this
pony, put a saddle on him.

08:59.308 --> 09:00.715
You down for some hazing?

09:00.748 --> 09:02.155
Oh, honey. I am down.

09:02.188 --> 09:04.395
- Spread the word.
- Okay.

09:04.428 --> 09:06.443
BP is 90 systolic, heart rate's up to 120,

09:06.476 --> 09:07.786
and her glucose is 168.

09:07.819 --> 09:09.867
Okay, well, she's not hypoglycemic,

09:09.899 --> 09:11.499
but her heart rate is out of control.

09:11.531 --> 09:12.906
Look, Jordan, I have a patient.

09:12.939 --> 09:14.442
- Uh, call me if you need me.
- Okay.

09:14.476 --> 09:16.970
Hola. ¿Cómo se llama?

09:17.003 --> 09:17.962
Sandra.

09:17.995 --> 09:19.626
Sandra. Dr. Alexander.

09:19.659 --> 09:22.698
Uh, por favor, puedes cambiar su vesitdo?

09:22.731 --> 09:24.371
No, no thank
you. I want to leave my dress on.

09:24.395 --> 09:25.642
Okay. So you speak English.

09:25.675 --> 09:27.977
Um, well, we need to do an EKG,

09:28.011 --> 09:31.114
so we're gonna need you to
trade this gown for this gown.

09:31.147 --> 09:32.618
Sorry. All right.

09:32.650 --> 09:34.601
Let's see what we got here.

09:34.635 --> 09:37.962
Okay, Sandra. Are you
currently on any medication?

09:39.627 --> 09:41.546
Any pain?

09:41.578 --> 09:43.498
This was a mistake. I don't
know why I came here.

09:43.531 --> 09:45.545
I really have to go somewhere.
He's waiting for me.

09:45.578 --> 09:46.697
He will be worried.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.041
- And I have...
- Hey.

09:48.810 --> 09:51.465
It looks like somebody made
the evening gown round.

09:51.498 --> 09:53.769
Yes. This is Sandra. It's okay.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.946
She came in here tachy and hypotensive,

09:55.978 --> 09:58.217
and I am guessing, by her attire,

09:58.250 --> 10:00.937
that, uh, maybe she took some diet pills.

10:00.970 --> 10:03.273
Yes. Yes, I did, for the competition.

10:03.305 --> 10:04.360
Ganaste?

10:04.394 --> 10:05.320
No, I didn't win.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.665
Sorry.

10:06.698 --> 10:10.604
Okay, Sandra, your heart
is beating way too fast,

10:10.638 --> 10:12.079
so we're gonna give you some fluids

10:12.112 --> 10:13.897
and put you on a sedative to calm you down.

10:13.929 --> 10:16.209
Look, my sister used to be involved
in all this pageant craziness.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.033
Uh, maybe she's taking a
bunch of diuretics, too.

10:18.057 --> 10:19.657
Yeah. I'll run a metabolic panel.

10:19.689 --> 10:21.000
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:21.033 --> 10:24.136
All right. Espero que te recuperés pronto.

10:24.169 --> 10:27.304
Sandra, you really don't have
to look like these women

10:27.338 --> 10:29.416
on a cover of a fashion magazine.

10:29.450 --> 10:32.080
But that's how you win, and that's
how I can get money for college.

10:32.104 --> 10:35.400
I get it, but you still have to
take care of yourself, okay?

10:35.433 --> 10:39.752
All right, I will come back
to check in on you. Okay?

10:48.776 --> 10:50.599
Hey! Krista!

10:50.633 --> 10:52.103
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:52.136 --> 10:54.407
I noticed you were gone
when I woke up this morning.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.679
Yeah, I just... I had to
go back to my apartment

10:56.712 --> 10:58.119
and grab my gym stuff, so...

10:58.153 --> 10:59.239
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:59.273 --> 11:00.455
Hey. For me? Great.

11:00.488 --> 11:02.184
Chop, chop. We got work to do.

11:02.216 --> 11:03.216
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kenny.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.807
Yo. Yo.

11:04.839 --> 11:06.854
Um, yeah, I'm just, um,
trying to kiss some ass.

11:06.888 --> 11:09.927
Oh, I get that... kissing ass.
As long as it's not literally.

11:11.912 --> 11:13.607
You know, you can, uh,

11:13.639 --> 11:15.943
you can leave some stuff at my place.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.991
I'll... I'll clean out a
drawer for you, all right?

11:18.024 --> 11:19.527
It's no big deal.

11:19.559 --> 11:21.734
It's just a drawer, though.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.367
It's...

11:23.399 --> 11:26.342
the drawer is never <i>just</i> a drawer.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.326
- All right.
- You know?

11:28.359 --> 11:30.406
No, save me some work.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.591
- Yeah.
- It's cool.

11:31.623 --> 11:32.551
I'll see you.

11:32.583 --> 11:33.734
Yeah, I'll see you.

11:33.768 --> 11:35.302
Mm, mm, mm!

11:35.335 --> 11:37.222
Legs like a gazelle on that one.

11:37.255 --> 11:39.430
Yeah, that's incredibly inappropriate.

11:39.462 --> 11:40.838
I'm not the boss anymore.

11:40.871 --> 11:43.270
I am a physician's assistant now.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.734
Yeah, emphasis on the word "assistant."

11:45.767 --> 11:49.414
And, uh, hey. Topher's looking for you.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.046
Therastrap.

11:55.847 --> 11:58.501
You have a sinus infection.

11:58.535 --> 11:59.982
I'll write you a
prescription for Augmentin.

12:00.006 --> 12:01.198
Take it two times a day for 10 days,

12:01.222 --> 12:02.964
- and the nasal spray, use at bedtime.
- Yep

12:02.997 --> 12:04.709
Excuse me.

12:08.006 --> 12:09.445
Hey.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.109
I know...

12:11.141 --> 12:13.733
I know the Vicodin makes you
nauseous. Take the Zofran.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.069
N-no. His office hasn't called.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.021
I can't... Rick, it's the
middle of the night.

12:18.053 --> 12:20.453
His office is closed. I
can't make him call me.

12:20.486 --> 12:22.148
Okay. I love you, too.

12:22.181 --> 12:25.413
I got to go. I got to...

12:26.949 --> 12:29.732
Does anyone here know a
Dr. Anderson at the VA?

12:29.765 --> 12:31.588
Uh, he's my friend's doc.

12:31.622 --> 12:33.379
She calls him Dr. Blackhole.

12:33.412 --> 12:35.528
Took six months for her to get
a referral for a podiatrist.

12:35.552 --> 12:37.504
Did she try changing primary physicians?

12:37.538 --> 12:37.892
She tried, but they told her

12:37.925 --> 12:40.232
she'd go to the back of the line.

12:41.989 --> 12:42.980
Great.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.828
Uh, damn it.

12:45.861 --> 12:47.949
Barbs are imbedded to deeply in
this section of the small bowel.

12:47.973 --> 12:49.548
Every time I try and
cut the ends, he bleeds.

12:49.572 --> 12:51.149
Let's get him to the
hospital. Get me a board.

12:51.173 --> 12:52.100
Yeah.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.356
All right, Brian. Stay with me.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.619
The bleeding's getting
worse. We're losing him.

12:55.652 --> 12:56.844
He's not gonna make it like this.

12:56.868 --> 12:58.340
I have to stop this bleeding.

12:58.372 --> 13:00.396
Let's get him into the ambulance.
I'll start the surgery.

13:00.420 --> 13:02.467
You want to do surgery in the ambulance?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.419
No. But it's that or he dies.

13:05.860 --> 13:09.155
He's got a pulse. Shallow breathing.

13:11.459 --> 13:12.610
Let's go.

13:21.643 --> 13:23.435
- High-flow O2.
- Hang in there, Brian.

13:25.643 --> 13:27.690
TC
- Damn it!

13:27.723 --> 13:30.265
He's hemorrhaging. I can't
figure out what's bleeding.

13:30.299 --> 13:31.881
So what can we do?

13:31.915 --> 13:33.631
Wait, wait, wait. It's his iliac artery.

13:33.665 --> 13:34.542
Hand me my suture kit.

13:34.576 --> 13:36.202
I need something to clamp the distal

13:36.235 --> 13:37.978
and the proximal to the tear.

13:38.011 --> 13:39.721
- Hemostats.
- Yeah. Okay.

13:39.755 --> 13:41.865
Place them right there.

13:41.898 --> 13:43.090
- Place them together.
- Like this?

13:43.114 --> 13:45.001
Yep. Okay. Good job.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.249
See? There's the laceration.

13:46.282 --> 13:48.521
All right. I need 7-oh Prolene now.

13:48.554 --> 13:50.514
<i>Your call has been
forwarded to an automatic...</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:52.649
Hey, Sandra. How you feeling?

13:54.186 --> 13:55.114
Okay.

13:55.146 --> 13:56.586
Uh,

13:56.619 --> 13:59.549
well, just so you know, I
did some research online,

13:59.583 --> 14:01.154
and I found a few organizations

14:01.187 --> 14:02.674
where you can apply for
college scholarships and...

14:02.698 --> 14:04.488
you don't know anything about my life.

14:04.521 --> 14:06.281
You're right. I don't. I just...

14:06.313 --> 14:08.168
You're a rich, pretty, American doctor.

14:08.202 --> 14:10.405
You don't know me or what I have to do.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.062
So don't pretend you can come here...

14:14.086 --> 14:15.785
Heart rate's up to the 150s.

14:15.818 --> 14:17.705
That's really strange.

14:17.738 --> 14:19.280
She's gotten worse with the benzos.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.672
She's in atrial fibrillation.

14:24.705 --> 14:27.168
Kenny, bolus her 5 of Metoprolol.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.723
Sandra, we're gonna give
you new medication... and

14:29.756 --> 14:32.128
I'm sorry that I meddled.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.044
All right. All set.

14:34.078 --> 14:36.197
All right. Let's check
on her every 15 minutes.

14:36.231 --> 14:37.334
All right.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.387
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:50.421 --> 14:53.083
Welcome to our PSA on how <i>not</i> to party.

14:53.116 --> 14:54.629
These guys are tripping out on 'shrooms.

14:54.653 --> 14:56.795
This guy fell off a barn
hiding from the cops...

14:56.828 --> 14:58.811
blunt head trauma and
open forearm fracture.

14:58.844 --> 15:01.155
These girls are blind drunk...
somebody get the vomit buckets.

15:01.179 --> 15:03.835
I want 'shrooms in 3.
Drunkies in Exam 1 and 2.

15:03.868 --> 15:05.380
Paul, you're on broken
arm. Anywhere that's open.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.331
Yeah, I got it.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.771
Hey, uh, your moment to shine.

15:07.803 --> 15:09.060
Forget about the therastrap for now.

15:09.084 --> 15:10.491
Place some IVs, hang some fluids.

15:10.524 --> 15:11.931
I'm all over it.

15:11.964 --> 15:14.701
Oh, oh, and order tox screens
and alcohol levels, too, right?

15:14.734 --> 15:16.299
Gold star.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.435
I need a trauma panel
and four units O-negative.

15:19.468 --> 15:21.675
Mollie, notify Dr. Chavez,

15:21.707 --> 15:23.626
tell him he has an emergency case.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.579
I repaired the iliac
and packed the abdomen,

15:25.612 --> 15:27.915
but he needs a formal laparotomy.

15:27.948 --> 15:30.539
Push 2 grams of Cefotetan. Here.

15:30.572 --> 15:32.203
Great job out there, Tee.

15:32.236 --> 15:33.355
You, too.

15:33.388 --> 15:36.075
What's happening? Is he
getting operated on?

15:36.108 --> 15:38.211
Yeah, they're just prepping the OR,

15:38.244 --> 15:39.492
but you don't worry about it.

15:39.525 --> 15:41.697
But it's all my fault. I
dragged him to the party.

15:41.730 --> 15:44.991
No. You're gonna tell me he had
no interest in partying with hot chicks

15:45.025 --> 15:46.698
and he just wanted to
stay home and play chess?

15:46.722 --> 15:48.783
We got our top surgeon working on it.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.227
- He'll be fine. I promise.
- Can't you do it?

15:50.251 --> 15:52.121
No, 'cause it's not my job.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.330
Look, uh, if it makes you feel better,

15:56.362 --> 15:57.995
I'll go keep an eye on him, yeah?

15:58.027 --> 15:59.809
Kenny? This here is Kenny.

15:59.843 --> 16:01.394
He's gonna look after you,
set you up for your shoulder.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.476
Uh, Terrence... T...

16:03.509 --> 16:05.094
man, I been to a couple of your games, man.

16:05.118 --> 16:07.161
My, uh, my little cousin's on the team...
Ray Fournette.

16:07.185 --> 16:09.018
Oh, Ray-Ray. He's one
of our best linebackers.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.866
Ah, man, he's all right, man.
But, you, man, you the man.

16:11.900 --> 16:12.138
Oh, thanks.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.962
Uh, I think Ray said something about you.

16:13.994 --> 16:15.081
You played at UT, right?

16:15.114 --> 16:16.585
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

16:16.618 --> 16:18.217
Too bad you're old now.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.898
Think you could still play?
You look in okay shape.

16:20.932 --> 16:22.386
Okay?

16:22.419 --> 16:24.391
Hey, don't let the scrubs fool you, baby.

16:24.425 --> 16:26.363
You can crack an egg on these bad boys.

16:27.050 --> 16:29.353
All right, look, man, I'm gonna
finish up some paperwork,

16:29.386 --> 16:31.177
then I'll be back in a second, all right?

16:31.210 --> 16:32.488
Now, hang tight.

16:35.273 --> 16:37.160
Hey, what's the story
with the beauty queen?

16:37.193 --> 16:40.297
She's in a-fib. I got her on
beta blockers to rate control.

16:40.330 --> 16:43.880
I also managed to insult
her by giving her advice

16:43.913 --> 16:47.642
that she certainly didn't ask
for nor am I qualified to give.

16:47.676 --> 16:48.721
Well, that's what you're good at.

16:48.745 --> 16:51.888
I, uh... uh, giving advice.

16:51.921 --> 16:55.561
I mean, you're not afraid to...
I'm gonna go back to my reports.

16:55.595 --> 16:56.612
Mm-hmm.

16:56.646 --> 16:59.186
Yeah, so, uh... What's the deal with that?

16:59.220 --> 17:01.846
Every time I look up,
you're buried in paperwork.

17:01.879 --> 17:03.626
You know, it really sucks.

17:03.659 --> 17:05.372
Uh, you're gonna hate it.

17:05.405 --> 17:08.547
When they didn't replace Ragosa,
all this work fell on me...

17:08.580 --> 17:10.012
And eventually you.

17:10.012 --> 17:13.696
You know when you take...
take your job back.

17:15.912 --> 17:18.566
I'll meet you in the suture room.
All right.

17:18.598 --> 17:20.454
Drew, uh, hey.

17:20.487 --> 17:22.375
I didn't know you were here tonight.

17:22.406 --> 17:23.814
Yeah, working with the vets.

17:23.847 --> 17:25.310
That's the seventh time Rick has called me.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.767
I don't even know what
to say to him anymore.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.774
I can't force his VA doctor to see him.

17:28.807 --> 17:30.534
Yeah, well, it's a mess over there.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.774
Yeah, but it's driving me
crazy. I'm a problem-solver.

17:32.806 --> 17:34.598
I'm the guy who builds your Ikea furniture,

17:34.631 --> 17:36.326
I figure out what's wrong with your car,

17:36.359 --> 17:39.206
but this stuff with Rick...
I don't know how to fix.

17:39.239 --> 17:41.541
He probably just wants
you to be there for him.

17:41.575 --> 17:43.654
You know, like a... a shoulder to cry on.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.933
Oh.

17:44.966 --> 17:46.757
It's my beauty queen. I'm sorry.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.431
Why don't you have breakfast
with us after the shift?

17:48.455 --> 17:49.616
All right? We'll work it out.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.208
Uh, I don't understand.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.365
What are you doing?

17:55.640 --> 17:56.791
Starting an IV.

17:56.824 --> 17:58.720
No, you're stabbing this
girl all over the place.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.888
You're lucky she's too drunk
to know the difference.

18:00.921 --> 18:02.968
- Give me that.
- I'm not drunk.

18:03.002 --> 18:05.016
That's right, baby.

18:05.049 --> 18:06.324
Uh, w-what's, uh, what's going on?

18:06.348 --> 18:08.651
Ragosa's slashing this girl
like Jason from "Halloween."

18:08.685 --> 18:10.840
Oh, come on. It wasn't that bad.

18:10.873 --> 18:13.478
- I love Halloween.
- I love Jason.

18:13.512 --> 18:16.085
Okay, uh, well, I-I can
show you, if you want.

18:16.118 --> 18:17.554
Um... Hey, Mollie, I-I got it.

18:17.588 --> 18:18.295
Thanks.

18:18.328 --> 18:19.415
Oh. Oh.

18:19.448 --> 18:21.047
Bye, Mollie.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.679
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'll miss you.

18:22.712 --> 18:24.728
So, um, my trick is that, uh...
here you go...

18:24.760 --> 18:26.711
that I have them squeeze the ball...

18:26.745 --> 18:28.023
That's what she said.

18:28.056 --> 18:29.799
No, you mean "that's what <i>he</i> said."

18:29.833 --> 18:31.543
- No, that's not what I...
- Dumb-ass.

18:31.576 --> 18:34.117
- I a... okay, I am not a dumb-ass.
- You're a doodie.

18:34.150 --> 18:34.966
All right. Guys, guys.

18:34.999 --> 18:37.399
Whoa, hey, guys, please,
trying to work here.

18:37.432 --> 18:39.703
That's what she said.

18:39.736 --> 18:42.070
Oh, that one didn't work as good.

18:44.310 --> 18:45.673
- What do we got?
- She got 3 liters of saline

18:45.697 --> 18:48.126
and two rounds of Metoprolol, but
her heart rate just keeps going up.

18:48.150 --> 18:49.887
Okay, she should be
responding to treatment by now.

18:49.911 --> 18:54.550
Okay, get me another EKG
and start her on amiodarone.

18:55.863 --> 18:58.838
Everything's great.
Baby's heartbeat is fine.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.782
I think you just have a little indigestion.

19:03.158 --> 19:06.166
Hey. Becca, this is Michael.
You need something Michael?

19:06.199 --> 19:09.430
I've done five IVs, ordered
tox screens on everybody,

19:09.463 --> 19:10.998
cleaned up a lot of vomit.

19:11.031 --> 19:13.046
- But still no therastrap?
- No.

19:13.079 --> 19:14.325
PT needs to order it.

19:14.358 --> 19:16.310
Ah, they always say that.

19:16.342 --> 19:20.522
Um, it's just... you know,
when you gave me this job,

19:20.555 --> 19:22.197
you said I'd be doing medicine.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.350
Well, that list you just gave
me sounds pretty substantial

19:24.374 --> 19:25.717
for a physician's assistant.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.725
I mean, five IVs means five patients.

19:28.758 --> 19:31.605
Why don't you be responsible for
them and check their blood work?

19:33.014 --> 19:34.612
Right.

19:37.749 --> 19:40.340
We love messing with that guy.

19:40.373 --> 19:42.037
Antibiotics running in. Good.

19:42.070 --> 19:44.276
Blood pressure's up to 90 over 45.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.589
That's good news.

19:45.622 --> 19:48.148
I heard you performed an iliac
repair in a moving ambulance.

19:48.182 --> 19:49.108
That's very impressive.

19:49.142 --> 19:50.356
It wasn't my first choice,

19:50.389 --> 19:52.885
but the packing wasn't slowing
down the bleeding, so...

19:52.917 --> 19:54.558
He would have bled out. It's a good call.

19:56.534 --> 19:58.397
I can work with that. Let's
get him up to the OR.

19:58.421 --> 19:59.892
- Okay.
- Right behind you.

19:59.925 --> 20:01.556
What, you'd like to observe?

20:01.589 --> 20:03.828
- No, no. I'm going to assist.
- Hang on.

20:03.861 --> 20:05.815
Uh, Heather, why don't we
get Brian prepped for surgery.

20:05.839 --> 20:06.324
I'll be right behind you.

20:06.356 --> 20:07.764
- Sure thing.
- Okay.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.859
I heard about how you
banged heads with Scott.

20:15.892 --> 20:17.844
- I know you even fought.
- No.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.668
I wouldn't listen to what he says about me.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.235
No, I know it's personal.

20:21.267 --> 20:22.812
Guy moves down here to
be with his girlfriend

20:22.836 --> 20:24.668
only to find out she's in
love with her old boyfriend,

20:24.692 --> 20:27.348
I mean... I'd be pissed, too.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.541
Is there a point here?

20:29.575 --> 20:32.691
Yeah, the point is that's
not our history, all right?

20:32.724 --> 20:34.386
We have more in common.

20:34.420 --> 20:38.355
We both served, we both saw
some things we wish we hadn't.

20:38.388 --> 20:41.106
I'd just like to think
we have a bond in that.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.515
Right.

20:42.548 --> 20:45.171
Is this your way of telling me
you don't want me in the OR?

20:45.204 --> 20:49.180
No, I just don't want the usual
ER/surgery conflict, okay?

20:49.214 --> 20:51.122
You're welcome to come up there any time.

20:51.155 --> 20:52.763
You just have to respect that I'm in charge

20:52.787 --> 20:54.483
the way that you're in charge down here.

20:54.515 --> 20:56.978
All right, you trust my
leadership the way I trust yours.

20:57.012 --> 20:58.578
Mm.

20:58.611 --> 20:59.538
Hey, uh, Tee.

20:59.571 --> 21:00.851
Yeah.

21:00.883 --> 21:03.282
- Do you got a sec, man? Uh, Jordan needs you.
- Yeah.

21:03.315 --> 21:06.162
You see, there's already not
enough of you to go around.

21:06.195 --> 21:08.402
You come on up if you're able to.

21:11.027 --> 21:13.138
I have a young, healthy patient in a-fib,

21:13.171 --> 21:15.218
cardiac markers and
electrolytes look normal.

21:15.251 --> 21:17.723
She's been given three rounds
of beta blockers plus amiodarone,

21:17.747 --> 21:19.186
and she's just getting worse.

21:19.218 --> 21:21.073
- Look at her BP.
- Yeah, I know.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.347
That's after 15 of Metoprolol.
It doesn't make any sense.

21:25.073 --> 21:26.513
Oh.

21:26.545 --> 21:27.546
There was no chest trauma.

21:27.570 --> 21:28.977
Let's go... strip and flip.

21:29.009 --> 21:30.736
Hey, Sandra, we're gonna figure out

21:30.769 --> 21:32.337
what's going on with you, okay?

21:32.370 --> 21:33.297
All right, here we go.

21:33.330 --> 21:34.545
Up.

21:34.577 --> 21:36.081
Other side.

21:36.114 --> 21:37.681
- Any punctures?
- Nothing. Okay.

21:38.545 --> 21:40.081
Okay.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.344
Are those implants?

21:43.378 --> 21:44.697
They look like they were done by a butcher.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.992
Bargain basement cosmetic surgery.

21:47.026 --> 21:49.424
Yeah, but implants shouldn't
make her this sick this fast.

21:49.457 --> 21:50.672
Maybe she's getting septic.

21:50.705 --> 21:52.943
No fever, plus her blood
pressure's going up, not down.

21:52.977 --> 21:54.874
Oh! She's seizing.

21:54.898 --> 21:55.824
Give me a bite block.

21:55.858 --> 21:57.458
Grab at least 10 milligrams of Diazepam.

21:57.489 --> 21:59.183
Got it.

21:59.217 --> 22:01.647
Sats are dropping. Okay,
hand me a non-rebreather.

22:02.608 --> 22:04.880
Jordan, there's something in there.

22:06.442 --> 22:08.169
Oh, my God.

22:12.196 --> 22:13.850
She's crashing. Push the Diazepam.

22:13.884 --> 22:15.772
We need to get whatever's
inside of her out now.

22:15.806 --> 22:17.161
Diazepam's going in.

22:17.194 --> 22:18.194
All right, scalpel.

22:22.763 --> 22:23.810
Okay.

22:28.089 --> 22:30.295
Okay, that is not an implant.

22:30.328 --> 22:31.571
Is that cocaine?

22:31.605 --> 22:32.569
Yeah.

22:32.602 --> 22:33.946
Must have leaked into her system.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.929
That explains her crazy vitals.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.617
She's got a highway of cocaine
flowing into her bloodstream.

22:38.651 --> 22:40.889
Give her IV phentolamine.

22:40.922 --> 22:43.610
This explains why the beta
blockers were making her worse.

22:43.643 --> 22:46.905
I mean, really, who the
hell would do this to her?

22:46.938 --> 22:48.090
BP's coming down.

22:48.122 --> 22:49.561
Finally.

22:49.594 --> 22:50.850
What happened to the good old days

22:50.874 --> 22:52.505
of just hiding drugs up your butt?

22:54.107 --> 22:56.345
Ooh.

22:56.378 --> 22:57.593
Shh.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.161
What the hell are you doing now?

22:59.194 --> 23:00.952
I just got the girls' blood work back.

23:00.986 --> 23:04.345
Their alcohol level is zero, but
there's an anion gap acidosis.

23:04.378 --> 23:06.456
And look at them. They're
completely wasted.

23:06.490 --> 23:08.313
- Look, check this out, huh?
- Damn.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.361
- See how that urine glows?
- That is weird.

23:10.393 --> 23:11.930
- Yes, it is.
- Hey.

23:11.962 --> 23:13.176
Checking in on you guys.

23:13.210 --> 23:14.648
Ragosa's a pee detective now.

23:14.681 --> 23:15.897
- Holy...
- Oh, yeah.

23:15.930 --> 23:17.752
- See that?
- I think it's antifreeze.

23:17.785 --> 23:19.640
I bet they made their own moonshine.

23:19.673 --> 23:21.307
Our alcohol test only checks for ethanol,

23:21.331 --> 23:23.352
but antifreeze has ethylene glycol,

23:23.385 --> 23:24.635
which would explain the acidosis.

23:24.659 --> 23:27.064
- So you're a toxicologist now?
- Oh.

23:27.097 --> 23:29.874
Just covered toxic alcohols
in my board review class,

23:29.908 --> 23:30.668
if you must know.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.263
Whoa.

23:35.338 --> 23:37.041
They're both crashing.

23:37.075 --> 23:38.744
Uh, Mollie, get Topher.

23:40.441 --> 23:41.071
You needed me?

23:41.105 --> 23:43.129
I just need you to help me
put this shoulder back in.

23:43.153 --> 23:44.303
Lie back, Terrence.

23:44.336 --> 23:45.369
This is a tough kid.

23:45.403 --> 23:47.920
He doesn't want to take a
sedative for this procedure.

23:47.954 --> 23:49.134
Oh, you're gonna regret that.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.055
- Heard it was pretty crazy out there.
- Yeah.

23:51.088 --> 23:52.751
Like Lenny Ross without the RPG.

23:52.784 --> 23:54.544
Lenny Ross... he'd be, like, what, 28 now?

23:54.576 --> 23:57.014
Yeah. Okay, Terrence. So
Topher's gonna brace you,

23:57.048 --> 23:58.265
and I'm gonna pop your shoulder back in.

23:58.289 --> 24:00.655
You should have seen this
kid out there, Topher.

24:00.688 --> 24:01.879
Really held it together for his buddy.

24:01.903 --> 24:03.535
Ugh!

24:03.568 --> 24:04.686
You okay?

24:04.719 --> 24:06.702
Oh. I think so.

24:06.735 --> 24:08.047
Can I see Brian now?

24:08.079 --> 24:11.023
Uh, not yet. He's... he's
still up in surgery.

24:11.055 --> 24:12.398
I'll check in on him soon, okay?

24:12.432 --> 24:14.136
You're gonna be in rehab for
a couple weeks, be a sling,

24:14.160 --> 24:16.393
but you'll be good as new and ready
to kick ass at ASU next year

24:16.417 --> 24:17.846
That's great... more reason for you to bet.

24:17.870 --> 24:20.782
He... this guy is out of control.

24:20.815 --> 24:22.414
I got to give TC props.

24:22.447 --> 24:24.046
He did a pretty good job

24:24.079 --> 24:26.254
considering the guy was
ripped up by barbed wire.

24:26.287 --> 24:28.214
Although, I would have
called a surgeon out there.

24:28.238 --> 24:30.455
Mm. He was an army doc. I mean,
he's used to doing whatever it takes.

24:30.479 --> 24:32.590
That's the problem with
battlefield doctors...

24:32.622 --> 24:33.783
they think they can do anything.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.789
Aren't you a battlefield doc?

24:35.823 --> 24:38.702
I used to be. I used to be a lot of things.

24:38.735 --> 24:41.261
But I want to know more
about Dr. Krista Bell-Hart.

24:41.294 --> 24:42.381
Huh.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.974
No boyfriend, you want to
be in emergency medicine,

24:45.006 --> 24:48.013
dad a doctor, both went to
Harvard... How am I doing?

24:48.046 --> 24:50.349
No, I went to Stanford... on a scholarship.

24:50.382 --> 24:51.565
A scholarship.

24:51.598 --> 24:53.485
And my father installs
air-conditioning systems,

24:53.518 --> 24:55.093
- thank you very much.
- I stand corrected.

24:55.117 --> 24:59.405
And, uh... I've wanted to
be a doctor since I was 9.

24:59.438 --> 25:02.061
What, your hamster died, couldn't save him?

25:04.974 --> 25:06.412
My mother died of breast cancer.

25:08.077 --> 25:10.029
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

25:10.061 --> 25:13.261
I know you had the genetic
screening, right?

25:13.294 --> 25:15.576
Uh, n-no.

25:15.609 --> 25:17.292
- The BRCA testing?
- I know. I know.

25:17.326 --> 25:19.885
You know, for the people
that care about you.

25:19.917 --> 25:21.397
I've been a little busy.

25:21.421 --> 25:25.036
For 20 years? What are you waiting for?

25:27.725 --> 25:29.325
Yo, bud.

25:29.357 --> 25:30.445
Hey.

25:30.477 --> 25:32.013
It's amazing what you can find out

25:32.045 --> 25:33.388
about people on the Internet.

25:33.422 --> 25:35.349
Yeah, people
post all kind of weird stuff.

25:35.373 --> 25:37.516
What are you looking at? Anything juicy?

25:37.548 --> 25:40.492
Yeah, just found the home
address for Rick's VA doctor.

25:40.525 --> 25:41.844
I'm gonna pay him a visit tonight

25:41.868 --> 25:43.509
and make him sign Rick's referral request.

25:43.533 --> 25:45.844
And if that doesn't work, I just
found out the name of his kid,

25:45.868 --> 25:47.925
so I'm just gonna call him,
pretend he had an accident,

25:47.949 --> 25:49.717
tell him he's got to come
down to the hospital,

25:49.741 --> 25:50.827
and make him sign it here.

25:50.860 --> 25:52.939
- Yeah, no, that's a great idea.
- Mm-hmm.

25:52.972 --> 25:54.900
And when you get arrested
for assault and battery,

25:54.924 --> 25:56.619
uh, will you sell me your condo?

25:56.651 --> 26:00.427
Oh, no. You'll probably be
dead from him shooting you.

26:00.460 --> 26:02.379
He wouldn't shoot me. What are you, new?

26:02.411 --> 26:05.131
Come on, let's take a walk.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.730
Now.

26:08.075 --> 26:09.931
They have a wide anion gap acidosis.

26:09.964 --> 26:12.139
So is it possible they
drank the antifreeze?

26:12.172 --> 26:13.499
It's very possible.
They're in renal failure.

26:13.523 --> 26:14.219
Get me IV of fomepizole.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.171
We don't carry that in the ER.

26:16.203 --> 26:18.003
I can page the central pharmacy
tech. It's gonna take over an hour.

26:18.027 --> 26:20.138
- Okay, there's no time. We need beer.
- Beer?

26:20.171 --> 26:21.939
Michael, somebody has beer
in their trunk... it's Texas.

26:21.963 --> 26:23.306
Go ask. Go, go.

26:24.043 --> 26:25.738
Look, I know how you're feeling.

26:25.772 --> 26:27.978
All right? Me and my mom
took care of my grandma.

26:28.011 --> 26:30.890
God knows I loved that
woman like nobody's business.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.650
I mean, she was everything to me.

26:32.683 --> 26:35.082
But it was hard, nasty.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.802
Nobody prepares you for what it's like

26:37.834 --> 26:40.042
to take care of a sick family member.

26:40.075 --> 26:43.850
It makes you crazy, and
right now, you're crazy.

26:43.883 --> 26:47.305
Maybe it's not the best plan.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.850
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not a stu...

26:48.874 --> 26:51.145
it's a stupid plan.

26:51.179 --> 26:52.905
You need to chill.

26:52.938 --> 26:55.208
All right? Take care of yourself first.

26:55.242 --> 26:58.249
It's like... it's like, uh,
it's like on the airplane.

26:58.282 --> 27:00.297
They tell you to put your
own oxygen mask on first,

27:00.331 --> 27:02.121
then you take care of your kid.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.362
'Cause if something happens to you, man,

27:04.394 --> 27:05.673
w-what happens to them?

27:07.082 --> 27:08.393
Huh?

27:10.185 --> 27:12.361
- You just come up with that?
- Maybe.

27:12.393 --> 27:13.896
- That was good.
- That was good, huh?

27:13.929 --> 27:15.177
- Mm-hmm.
- You like that?

27:15.210 --> 27:16.457
Hey, Ray-Ray's Uncle,

27:16.490 --> 27:18.684
any chance I can get some
more of those painkillers?

27:18.717 --> 27:19.977
What's wrong?

27:20.010 --> 27:22.536
I got a real bad headache and...

27:22.569 --> 27:25.448
Terrence!

27:25.482 --> 27:27.401
You okay, man?

27:27.433 --> 27:28.617
Get TC!

27:28.649 --> 27:29.649
Got it.

27:32.508 --> 27:34.835
All right, everybody swears
he doesn't drink or do drugs.

27:34.878 --> 27:35.778
Yeah they're right.

27:35.811 --> 27:37.036
He's got increased pressure on his brain

27:37.060 --> 27:38.134
but no sign of trauma.

27:38.168 --> 27:39.960
See, he had a game earlier today.

27:39.994 --> 27:41.271
He plays running back.

27:41.304 --> 27:42.839
Probably got hit in the head 50 times.

27:42.872 --> 27:43.927
Maybe it's a concussion.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.815
One concussion wouldn't do this to him.

27:45.848 --> 27:47.126
Second impact syndrome.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.182
If he had a concussion,

27:48.216 --> 27:49.504
didn't have time to recover from it...

27:49.528 --> 27:51.392
The hits he took today
would explain the swelling

27:51.416 --> 27:52.927
- in his brain from a hematoma.
- Yeah.

27:52.951 --> 27:54.135
Push 100 grams of Mannitol.

27:54.167 --> 27:55.702
Why would they play him

27:55.735 --> 27:57.056
if he's still recovering from a concussion?

27:57.080 --> 27:59.007
This kid's an All-Star. He's
never coming out of the game.

27:59.031 --> 28:00.415
Probably wouldn't tell them, either,

28:00.439 --> 28:02.311
if he was going for a scholie.

28:02.344 --> 28:04.183
Okay, right pupil is dilating.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.662
- Call the neurosurgeon.
- He's posturing.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.522
- Okay.
- Ah, his brain's already herniating.

28:07.556 --> 28:09.358
He needs a burr hole to drain the hematoma.

28:09.391 --> 28:10.855
Scalpel.

28:12.151 --> 28:15.190
Yeah, this is Nurse Kenny Fournette in ER.

28:15.223 --> 28:16.470
I need, uh, neurosurgery.

28:16.502 --> 28:17.781
Uh, Dr. Johnson.

28:17.814 --> 28:19.286
Right.

28:19.319 --> 28:20.760
How long do we got?

28:20.790 --> 28:22.198
I need 911.

28:22.231 --> 28:25.525
Okay, I'm almost through.
Okay, that should do it.

28:25.559 --> 28:27.413
Okay.

28:27.446 --> 28:29.781
A neurosurgeon is 15 minutes out.

28:29.815 --> 28:30.943
- He stopped posturing.
- Nice work.

28:30.967 --> 28:32.327
All right, let's get him to the OR

28:33.590 --> 28:36.277
The alcohol competes
with the ethylene glycol

28:36.309 --> 28:37.525
for the receptors...

28:37.558 --> 28:38.901
Which stops the toxic conversion.

28:38.934 --> 28:41.054
Yeah, good excuse to always
have a six-pack in your trunk.

28:41.078 --> 28:42.934
- Good catch, Mollie.
- Thanks.

28:42.966 --> 28:44.153
What?

28:44.187 --> 28:48.149
Yeah, Mollie, uh... said she's
brushing up on her toxicology

28:48.181 --> 28:50.613
- and figured it all out.
- I got lucky, I guess.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.565
That wasn't luck. That was knowledge.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.740
You got a bright future,
Mollie. How are you doing?

28:54.774 --> 28:56.660
You have a bright future?

28:56.694 --> 28:57.845
- Mm.
- All right, good.

28:57.877 --> 28:59.134
Michael, I would watch out for this one.

28:59.158 --> 29:00.510
She might be gunning for your job.

29:00.534 --> 29:02.196
Hmm.

29:03.733 --> 29:04.820
Wow.

29:04.853 --> 29:07.156
Did that really just happen?

29:07.189 --> 29:10.773
Yeah, um... and, I... I'm sorry.

29:10.805 --> 29:12.724
Look, therastraps aren't
really, uh, a thing.

29:12.757 --> 29:15.188
Y-you didn't hear that from me.

29:20.308 --> 29:21.661
I heard that you
were asking for food,

29:21.685 --> 29:23.923
and, unfortunately, we can't let you eat

29:23.957 --> 29:26.675
until after the plastic
surgeon fixes your sutures.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.532
Just try not to move around too much.

29:28.565 --> 29:31.092
Are you going to call the police?

29:31.124 --> 29:33.556
I had to.

29:33.588 --> 29:35.027
I'm sorry.

29:35.059 --> 29:37.875
All you have to do is just
tell them what happened.

29:37.908 --> 29:39.091
All right?

29:40.723 --> 29:42.771
And... you kn... You know what?

29:42.804 --> 29:45.651
I'm just... I'm gonna say this because
I can't help myself, but look...

29:45.684 --> 29:49.901
If you need a lawyer, I have a
friend, and she owes me a favor.

29:49.935 --> 29:50.739
I could talk to her.

29:50.771 --> 29:53.707
I'm sure she could take your case for free.

29:53.740 --> 29:54.610
Thank you.

29:54.643 --> 29:57.394
I know you're just trying to help.

29:57.427 --> 29:58.642
I'm gonna call her.

30:00.756 --> 30:03.475
All right.

30:10.056 --> 30:11.384
So keep me updated on his condition,

30:11.408 --> 30:13.002
and let me know when his parents get here.

30:13.026 --> 30:14.578
I'm gonna check on his buddy... Brian.

30:14.611 --> 30:15.611
All right.

30:23.346 --> 30:25.138
- Belly's filling.
- He's getting tachy.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.003
- What is it? What's happening?
- We don't know.

30:27.027 --> 30:29.178
- We're trying to figure it out.
- Okay, I'm scrubbing in.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.298
I'd be shocked if you didn't.

30:30.322 --> 30:32.114
What?

30:32.146 --> 30:34.450
Yeah, I found your therastrap. Number 10.

30:34.482 --> 30:36.977
Hope you enjoy it. I hope
everyone had a good laugh.

30:37.010 --> 30:38.065
Ha, ha, ha.

30:38.098 --> 30:39.546
Well, we did have a good laugh.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.499
Hey, hey, are you gonna tell
him that the save was my idea?

30:41.523 --> 30:43.290
- I told...
- She gave you credit right from the top.

30:43.314 --> 30:45.073
I mean, this is a big team, Michael.

30:45.106 --> 30:46.833
We're just trying to help you fit in.

30:46.866 --> 30:47.866
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

30:49.234 --> 30:50.929
Sandra, I...

30:56.561 --> 30:58.513
It's been one of those nights.

30:58.546 --> 31:00.473
I must have been sloppy
suturing in the ambulance.

31:00.497 --> 31:01.649
You stopped the bleeding.

31:01.682 --> 31:03.386
You just accidentally
cut off the blood flow.

31:03.410 --> 31:05.498
I screwed up. I should have
just repacked the abdomen.

31:05.522 --> 31:07.673
I know vascular surgeons that
have made the same mistake,

31:07.697 --> 31:09.264
and they weren't in a moving ambulance.

31:09.297 --> 31:11.888
I'm just gonna cut the suture,
it'll pink right back up.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.616
Trust me. Let's get the bowel reperfused.

31:13.650 --> 31:14.640
More Motown?

31:14.673 --> 31:15.632
Do you ever listen to anything else?

31:15.665 --> 31:17.968
- Not when I'm working.
- It's not so bad.

31:18.002 --> 31:20.720
All right, needle driver to Dr. Callahan.

31:24.721 --> 31:26.736
- Anything?
- Nothing.

31:26.768 --> 31:28.815
Mollie, Mollie.

31:30.449 --> 31:32.240
Oh.

31:33.361 --> 31:34.383
Nothing.

31:34.417 --> 31:35.567
Nothing.

31:36.945 --> 31:38.864
- Where...
- W-w-w-wait.

31:51.657 --> 31:52.967
Hey, hey, hey.

31:53.001 --> 31:54.631
Okay, honey, let me see.

31:55.784 --> 31:57.064
You tore your stitches.

31:57.097 --> 31:58.385
Mollie, can you get a gurney, please?

31:58.409 --> 31:59.336
Yeah.

31:59.369 --> 32:00.391
Okay.

32:00.425 --> 32:03.208
Honey, I don't know your life,

32:03.241 --> 32:05.703
but I know that running
away is not gonna help you.

32:05.736 --> 32:08.647
He said they would take those things out,

32:08.680 --> 32:10.663
but I started to get sick in the car ride

32:10.696 --> 32:11.815
on the way to the place,

32:11.849 --> 32:15.207
and they pushed me out
on the street corner,

32:15.240 --> 32:17.671
and now I'm gonna go to jail.

32:19.464 --> 32:22.151
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

32:23.336 --> 32:25.415
Okay.

32:25.447 --> 32:28.007
Here's how I see it.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.727
He let someone mutilate your body,

32:30.760 --> 32:32.999
he asked you to commit a crime for him,

32:33.031 --> 32:35.463
and then he left you alone to die.

32:35.496 --> 32:38.086
You don't deserve this.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.534
You're gonna be okay.

32:46.535 --> 32:47.847
Great job in there.

32:47.879 --> 32:49.350
Thanks.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.742
Oh, you saved his life. All we
did was a bit of housekeeping.

32:52.775 --> 32:55.910
Nah, it was more than that.
Thanks for letting me assist.

32:55.943 --> 32:59.014
Well, thanks for pissing Scott off

32:59.046 --> 33:00.710
and opening up this job for me.

33:00.743 --> 33:02.758
Yeah, I'm gonna go to talk to the mom.

33:09.702 --> 33:11.621
That was nice of you.

33:11.655 --> 33:14.438
I heard he lost a patient earlier.

33:14.470 --> 33:15.813
Yeah.

33:15.846 --> 33:18.309
Yeah, I used to know a
lot of guys like him.

33:18.342 --> 33:20.006
I used to be like him.

33:20.039 --> 33:22.245
Take losses pretty hard.

33:24.774 --> 33:26.884
Anyway, I'm just trying not to be a dick.

33:26.918 --> 33:28.293
That's my mantra.

33:28.326 --> 33:31.205
You know, but I think you and
TC have a budding bromance.

33:31.238 --> 33:33.061
He clearly likes you.

33:33.094 --> 33:36.709
Well, um, he's not the one that
I'm concerned about liking me.

33:39.494 --> 33:42.469
Don't panic.
I'm not talking about you.

33:42.501 --> 33:44.900
I-I was thinking about asking Jordan out.

33:44.933 --> 33:46.852
You know, 'cause I-I don't
think the two of them

33:46.886 --> 33:47.643
are right for each other.

33:47.676 --> 33:50.468
Oh, uh, you know, I-I-I'm not sure that...

33:50.501 --> 33:52.645
Look at your face.

33:52.678 --> 33:54.693
- I got you.
- Oh, my God.

33:54.725 --> 33:56.420
No, just... just for a second.

33:56.453 --> 33:58.308
It still counts. I'll see you later.

33:58.341 --> 34:01.060
Oh, coffee next time ...please, no sugar.

34:01.093 --> 34:03.076
It's the silent killer.

34:09.829 --> 34:11.107
Oh, thanks a lot.

34:11.139 --> 34:12.259
Mm.

34:12.293 --> 34:14.755
Hey, how'd it work out with
the runaway beauty queen?

34:14.788 --> 34:15.812
We'll see.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.292
I'm not too optimistic about her future

34:17.315 --> 34:18.348
if that's her taste in men.

34:18.371 --> 34:20.163
How about you, huh?

34:20.196 --> 34:22.277
How you feeling? Ready to
leave the desk work behind?

34:22.308 --> 34:23.619
I'm definitely feeling better,

34:23.652 --> 34:25.732
but being the boss does not suck.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.492
Okay.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.411
You've been hinting at something all night.

34:29.443 --> 34:30.531
What gives?

34:30.563 --> 34:31.980
We... we've known each other a long time.

34:32.004 --> 34:34.051
I just don't want things
to get weird between us.

34:36.132 --> 34:38.540
- You want to keep the job, is that it?
- Not... not if you want it.

34:38.563 --> 34:40.108
So, you're saying that you
only want it if I don't want it?

34:40.132 --> 34:41.858
No, I-I don't want it if you...

34:41.891 --> 34:43.074
let's do this...

34:43.108 --> 34:46.242
um, count of three, we both
say what we want, okay?

34:46.275 --> 34:48.170
- One, two, three. I do want it.
- I don't want it.

34:48.195 --> 34:49.283
- Oh.
- Hey.

34:49.315 --> 34:50.562
- You...
- Hey.

34:50.596 --> 34:52.362
- Congratulations.
- You're the boss. All right.

34:52.387 --> 34:54.331
I'm so glad we got to work
this out like grown-ups.

34:54.356 --> 34:54.818
Oh, yeah.

34:54.851 --> 34:59.267
Hey, uh, Topher, why do you have a plunger?

34:59.299 --> 35:01.314
This... this used to be a plunger.

35:01.347 --> 35:03.682
Now it's a scepter!

35:03.715 --> 35:06.242
Oh, boy. Word of advice...

35:06.275 --> 35:07.627
don't let the power go to your head.

35:07.651 --> 35:08.651
It is too late.

35:09.762 --> 35:10.690
What?!

35:10.722 --> 35:11.650
Oh.

35:11.682 --> 35:13.058
Very funny.

35:13.091 --> 35:14.626
Prank the boss.

35:14.658 --> 35:15.745
Wasn't me.

35:15.778 --> 35:16.994
I wonder who did that.

35:17.026 --> 35:18.881
Mm, yes. I wonder, too.

35:18.914 --> 35:21.473
You, really? T-that's not bad.

35:22.594 --> 35:25.377
That was me, too.

35:25.410 --> 35:28.225
I can play just as hard as they can.

35:28.258 --> 35:29.921
I-I'd keep that quiet.

35:29.955 --> 35:33.025
Nobody messes with Mollie.

35:36.962 --> 35:38.465
How you doing?

35:38.497 --> 35:40.416
Did you hear?

35:40.450 --> 35:42.817
They say I'll never be
able to play ball again.

35:42.850 --> 35:45.280
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

35:45.314 --> 35:47.296
It's a tough break.

35:47.330 --> 35:48.704
You think?

35:48.737 --> 35:50.880
They told me Brian's gonna be fine.

35:50.914 --> 35:52.129
Yeah.

35:52.162 --> 35:56.224
He's gonna make a full recovery,
and you helped with that.

35:56.257 --> 35:57.760
I'm sorry, man, I mean...

35:57.794 --> 35:59.305
I wish you could have
played ball together, uh...

35:59.329 --> 36:00.544
- Hey, Tee.
- Yeah?

36:00.577 --> 36:02.144
Can I talk to him for a sec?

36:02.177 --> 36:03.615
Yeah.

36:03.649 --> 36:05.664
Glad you're okay.

36:10.433 --> 36:13.281
You know, I've, uh, I've
been where you are.

36:13.313 --> 36:15.744
I was a 5-star recruit, All-American,

36:15.778 --> 36:18.176
- 20-some-odd scholarships,
- Man...

36:18.209 --> 36:20.672
I really don't want to hear
about your stupid glory days

36:20.704 --> 36:21.888
right now.

36:21.921 --> 36:24.768
Now, that... that's true.
That's true, my glory days.

36:24.801 --> 36:26.847
My glory days ended my freshman year

36:26.880 --> 36:29.695
when I fractured my back in training camp.

36:29.728 --> 36:31.264
Never played a game.

36:31.296 --> 36:33.471
I spent an entire year in traction,

36:33.504 --> 36:35.871
so, trust me, I do get
where you're coming from.

36:35.903 --> 36:37.375
- I do.
- Great.

36:37.408 --> 36:40.479
So, this is what I have
to look forward to...

36:40.512 --> 36:42.911
being a nurse.

36:42.944 --> 36:46.558
Maybe I can clean some bedpans.

36:46.592 --> 36:48.415
You know what?

36:48.448 --> 36:50.079
I-I'm sorry.

36:50.112 --> 36:52.670
You may not what to talk right now,

36:52.703 --> 36:55.806
and I-I get that, but if
you change your mind,

36:55.839 --> 36:58.078
want to talk about anything
at all, whatever you want...

36:58.112 --> 37:02.526
I mean, anything... I'm around, all right?

37:02.559 --> 37:03.582
You get some rest.

37:03.615 --> 37:05.631
I'll, uh... I'm gonna check on you later.

37:05.663 --> 37:08.766
Don't forget what I said.

37:11.711 --> 37:13.470
Please tell me you're
done with those forms.

37:13.503 --> 37:15.934
I had 10 runs in four hours. I need food.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.533
Okay, here you go, darling.

37:17.567 --> 37:19.647
Put this in your pie hole
and give me another minute.

37:19.679 --> 37:21.566
Not a huge fan of cranberry.

37:21.599 --> 37:23.454
Eat it.

37:24.895 --> 37:26.142
Hey.

37:26.174 --> 37:27.421
Hey.

37:27.454 --> 37:28.926
You up for breakfast?

37:28.958 --> 37:30.173
No. No. Thanks.

37:30.206 --> 37:33.373
But I just need to be on
my own for a little bit.

37:33.406 --> 37:34.653
I'll call you later.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.702
Hey. You sure you're all right?

37:36.734 --> 37:38.205
Yeah, it's just...

37:38.238 --> 37:41.053
I just keep thinking about
the woman that I lost.

37:41.086 --> 37:43.005
- Worst part of the job.
- Yeah. I'll be okay.

37:43.038 --> 37:44.541
- All right.
- Promise.

37:47.326 --> 37:48.670
* Your heart breaks *

37:48.702 --> 37:51.517
Oh! Mm! Did you see that shot?

37:51.550 --> 37:52.796
Beautiful.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.685
I believe that's 20 bucks you owe me.

37:54.717 --> 37:56.709
What the heck? Clearly,
you have this game at home.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.324
Maybe, or maybe I'm just full of surprises.

37:59.358 --> 38:02.044
Double or nothing. Come on.

38:02.077 --> 38:03.900
* I say, love... *

38:03.933 --> 38:05.820
So that kid brought back
some memories, huh?

38:05.853 --> 38:07.517
Oh, yeah. So much I want to tell him.

38:07.549 --> 38:09.979
He's just not ready to hear it yet.

38:10.013 --> 38:10.939
Like?

38:10.973 --> 38:13.115
Oh, you know, nothing big. Little stuff.

38:13.149 --> 38:15.388
* ...worth fighting for *

38:15.421 --> 38:17.692
Come on, you can tell me. Like what?

38:17.725 --> 38:21.244
Well, like, uh... when they told
me I couldn't play anymore,

38:21.277 --> 38:24.220
I thought my life was over, but...
but it wasn't.

38:24.253 --> 38:25.531
You know, before I got hurt,

38:25.565 --> 38:27.803
I thought nurses just
cleaned up after patients,

38:27.836 --> 38:29.083
but they were so much more.

38:29.117 --> 38:31.195
I was lucky if I saw the doctor once a day.

38:31.229 --> 38:33.115
It was the nurses that took care of me.

38:33.149 --> 38:34.748
Nurses taught me to walk again.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.028
They make the hospital run.

38:36.061 --> 38:37.819
That's, uh, that's why I became one.

38:37.853 --> 38:39.579
So, in a weird way, that accident

38:39.612 --> 38:41.819
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

38:43.484 --> 38:45.723
Why have you never told me this?

38:45.755 --> 38:46.876
I don't know.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.068
Maybe because you never tell me

38:48.092 --> 38:49.284
anything personal about yourself.

38:49.308 --> 38:50.490
Just keeping it light, right?

38:50.524 --> 38:53.787
* I say, love, love don't mean nothing *

38:53.820 --> 38:55.835
Let me guess, you got a
call from The Intrepid.

38:55.869 --> 38:57.435
Rick's got an appointment on Tuesday.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.034
How the hell did you pull that off?

38:59.068 --> 39:01.050
I found out this guy I went
to medical school with

39:01.084 --> 39:02.874
is on staff there, and
he's doing me a solid.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.195
I mean, you guys must have been tight.

39:04.219 --> 39:06.362
Yeah, we...

39:06.395 --> 39:07.811
- Yep.
- You know what? You're so very welcome.

39:07.835 --> 39:08.900
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

39:08.924 --> 39:10.435
- Thank you. I got to go.
- Okay.

39:10.459 --> 39:12.763
That's right. You're still
talking to the boss, girl.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.282
So you can stay home with
the kids. What do you mean?

39:17.691 --> 39:19.162
I thought that's what you wanted.

39:19.194 --> 39:20.602
* It's a beautiful war *

39:20.635 --> 39:23.578
Are you gonna drink that or
stare at it all day, TC?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.946
Can I just get a cup of coffee?

39:25.979 --> 39:27.322
Coming right up.

39:27.355 --> 39:29.529
You look like you had a rough night.

39:29.562 --> 39:31.193
Want to talk about it?

39:31.226 --> 39:32.217
Nope.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.297
Just gonna to read my book,

39:34.330 --> 39:37.209
if you don't mind me sitting
here awhile not drinking.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.353
Sit all you want.

39:39.387 --> 39:41.146
Mm. "The Great Gatsby."

39:41.178 --> 39:43.322
That's a good one. Better than the movie.

39:43.354 --> 39:45.305
Yeah... So I heard.

39:45.338 --> 39:47.961
* It's a beautiful war *

39:47.993 --> 39:49.657
What I've heard.

39:52.921 --> 39:53.847
Yeah.

39:53.881 --> 39:55.736
* Beautiful war *
