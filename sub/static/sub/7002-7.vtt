WEBVTT

00:00.933 --> 00:02.701
Before we get started,
I want to remind our audience

00:02.702 --> 00:05.904
That next time on <i>tool time</i>
we have some very special
guests.

00:05.905 --> 00:09.307
That superstar racing team
of mario and michael andretti

00:09.308 --> 00:11.309
Will be here. All right.

00:15.982 --> 00:18.883
I'm very excited to have
my racing heroes on the show.

00:18.884 --> 00:21.385
It's hard to imagine
you getting so jazzed-up
about racing,

00:21.386 --> 00:22.721
The way you drive.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.356
He drives like an old woman
in a church parking lot.

00:25.357 --> 00:27.558
Watch out for the speed bump!
Ba-bump.

00:27.559 --> 00:29.628
I drive defensively, tim.

00:29.629 --> 00:32.063
You <i>dress</i> defensively, al.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.967
My mother gave me this shirt.

00:35.968 --> 00:38.837
Why? Did she outgrow it?

00:38.838 --> 00:40.705
No...

00:40.706 --> 00:42.607
Anyway, let's get back
to our salute...
<i>(squelch)</i>

00:42.608 --> 00:45.376
...To lubricants.
For this demonstration,

00:45.377 --> 00:48.113
We've split this straight
six-cylinder down the middle.

00:48.114 --> 00:51.016
Tim, my mother has
very fine taste. Her shirts
look nothing like this.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.217
Right, al.
Anyway, try to imagine,

00:53.218 --> 00:56.220
If you will,
that my fists are pistons.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.723
All right, al.
Close up the engine.

00:58.724 --> 01:01.559
Gladly, tim.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.062
Oh!

01:04.063 --> 01:06.397
Ok. Let's try to start
this engine.

01:06.398 --> 01:08.933
<i>(making engine noises)</i>

01:13.706 --> 01:15.073
Well, it won't start.

01:15.074 --> 01:17.608
That's because the pistons
are stuck.

01:17.609 --> 01:20.611
Just like they were last year
during the nba play-offs.

01:22.481 --> 01:25.083
But they will move
if they're lubricated.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.052
That's if the oil pump
is pumping oil

01:27.053 --> 01:29.353
Through the system,
the pistons will move.

01:29.354 --> 01:31.690
So, let's open the engine up
and show 'em how the oil
gets in there.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.257
Grab the oil
and open me up, al.

01:33.258 --> 01:35.359
Ah, here it is,
of course, motor oil.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.129
Well, gee, I wouldn't want
to get any of this

01:38.130 --> 01:40.464
On my nice shirt
my mother gave me.

01:40.465 --> 01:44.268
I better go change
before I let you out.

01:44.269 --> 01:47.105
Come on, open this up, al.
Al!

01:51.276 --> 01:52.944
<i>Tool time</i> tip of the day:

01:52.945 --> 01:55.113
When you're insulting
your coworker's mother,

01:55.114 --> 01:58.149
Make sure you're not locked
into an engine compartment.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.851
<i>Al, I know you're back there.</i>

01:59.852 --> 02:01.652
<i>Al, I know right</i>
<i>where you're standing.</i>

02:01.653 --> 02:03.688
<i>Al, let me out.</i>

02:53.739 --> 02:55.573
Mark, stop scratching

02:55.574 --> 02:58.342
Or I'm gonna have to cut
your fingernails even shorter!

02:58.343 --> 02:59.710
<i>(mark)</i> but it itches!

02:59.711 --> 03:03.181
Well, bring the calamine lotion
down again.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.849
<i>(mark)</i> aw, man.

03:04.850 --> 03:08.086
Mom, please,
please don't run away.

03:08.087 --> 03:10.688
These are for your father.
He's never had chickenpox

03:10.689 --> 03:12.290
And I don't want mark
to give 'em to him,

03:12.291 --> 03:15.293
So he's gonna have to move out
for a few days.

03:15.294 --> 03:18.663
Huh. Well, I've never had
chickenpox, either.

03:18.664 --> 03:20.265
I think I'll just go
pack my bags

03:20.266 --> 03:22.133
And check into a nice hotel.

03:22.134 --> 03:24.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You stay right where you are.
I want you to get 'em.

03:24.369 --> 03:28.072
Did you kiss your brother
like I told you to?

03:28.073 --> 03:31.009
Oh, yeah, and we're getting
married next Tuesday.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.478
I wish you would be nicer
to your brother.

03:34.479 --> 03:37.916
You know, he's probably
the only little brother
you're ever gonna have.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.750
In fact, I guarantee you

03:39.751 --> 03:42.253
He's the only little brother
you're ever gonna have.

03:42.254 --> 03:44.555
So here, just take
this juice to him.

03:44.556 --> 03:48.359
And you better be sick
when you get up in the morning.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.695
<i>(coughs)</i>

03:50.696 --> 03:53.631
Hi, baby.
Oh, hi.

03:53.632 --> 03:56.234
Why are my bags over here?
You gotta leave.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.203
Ohh.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.707
This is 'cause I said
that your mother was

04:02.708 --> 04:05.310
The world's second largest
mammal, isn't it?

04:09.414 --> 04:12.550
I never heard that.

04:12.551 --> 04:16.053
I never said it.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.589
Remember that fever
that mark had last night?

04:18.589 --> 04:21.492
Flu?
It's chickenpox.

04:21.493 --> 04:24.762
There are germs everywhere.
Don't touch that.

04:24.763 --> 04:27.531
I can't get sick.
The andrettis are gonna be
on <i>tool time.</i>

04:27.532 --> 04:29.934
I'll go to my mom's.
No, no. A hotel!

04:29.935 --> 04:31.970
Well, check with al
before you do anything else.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.705
Why?
Well, when I called
to warn you about that,

04:34.706 --> 04:37.242
He said that you could
stay at his apartment.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.710
Stay with al.
That's a good one.

04:39.711 --> 04:42.113
Well, I told him that
you'd get back to him.

04:42.114 --> 04:43.514
You didn't just say no?

04:43.515 --> 04:46.951
Well, I didn't know what to say.
He was really being sweet.

04:46.952 --> 04:50.454
He called you his roomie.

04:50.455 --> 04:51.990
Oh, man.

04:51.991 --> 04:55.693
Well, you know, he said
he wanted to do something nice

04:55.694 --> 04:58.096
Because of that lubricant thing
that he did to you -

04:58.097 --> 05:00.398
And please don't explain that.

05:02.868 --> 05:05.336
Mom.
What? That's mark.

05:05.337 --> 05:06.604
Don't let him get near you.
Go on, go on, go on.

05:06.605 --> 05:08.606
Mark, I gotta go away
for a couple of days.

05:08.607 --> 05:11.042
Feel better, buddy.
Thanks. I'll miss you.

05:11.043 --> 05:13.211
I'll miss you too, buddy.

05:13.212 --> 05:16.580
Hey, wilson.
Hi-de-ho, tim.

05:16.581 --> 05:18.283
<i>(tim)</i> smells like
you're barbecuing.
Mm-hmm.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.618
Smells good.
Burgers, hotdogs, chicken?
No, no, no.

05:20.619 --> 05:25.323
Today we're having some grilled
grasshopper-and-cricket kabobs.

05:26.892 --> 05:29.394
I got the recipe out of
my survival newsletter,

05:29.395 --> 05:31.329
<i>Aftermath.</i>

05:33.532 --> 05:35.934
Huh.
I'll be gone a couple days.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.803
Mark got chickenpox
and I've never had them so...

05:38.804 --> 05:40.138
Mm-hm-hm-hm.

05:40.139 --> 05:41.372
<i>(tim)</i> can I ask you a question?

05:41.373 --> 05:43.408
Throw another bug
on my barbecue.

05:46.611 --> 05:49.247
Al wants me to stay
at his apartment.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.649
And I really don't want to.
Mm-hmm.

05:51.650 --> 05:54.618
But if... If I say no,
I'm gonna hurt his feelings,

05:54.619 --> 05:58.323
And I don't want to do that,
so I guess I'm gonna have
to stay there, right?

05:58.324 --> 06:00.191
Well, tim.

06:00.192 --> 06:04.728
Your feelings are
important too. Right?
Yeah.

06:04.729 --> 06:07.098
Well, then you should tell al
exactly how you feel.

06:07.099 --> 06:10.435
You know what they say -
"honesty is the best policy."

06:10.436 --> 06:13.704
All right, all right, all right.
I'll just tell him the truth.

06:13.705 --> 06:15.840
I mean, guys don't lie
to each other.

06:15.841 --> 06:18.576
I'll just say
I don't want to stay there.
He'll understand that.

06:18.577 --> 06:20.611
Thanks, wilson.
Oh, you're welcome.

06:20.612 --> 06:24.315
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to scrounge up
an appetizer.

06:24.316 --> 06:27.185
<i>(al)</i> tim! Hi, tim!

06:27.186 --> 06:29.053
Al? What are you doing here?

06:29.054 --> 06:32.357
Talk about timing.
I was just coming
up the driveway

06:32.358 --> 06:34.592
And jill was coming down
with your bags,

06:34.593 --> 06:36.760
So I put them in my station
wagon out front.

06:36.761 --> 06:39.830
I really appreciate that,
al, but I...
Oh, and here, I...

06:39.831 --> 06:42.500
I-I had this made specially
for you, this key.

06:42.501 --> 06:45.269
It's got your initials on it.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.307
Al, I don't wanna
stay with you.

06:55.747 --> 06:58.716
I mean, I don't wanna stay
with you for very long.

06:58.717 --> 07:01.085
I don't wanna overstay
my welcome, you know,
become a burden.

07:01.086 --> 07:04.155
Oh, well, it's no burden.
Come on, roomie.

07:06.725 --> 07:09.394
Welcome to my humble abode,
roomie.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.329
Thanks, allie.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.167
So.

07:16.168 --> 07:19.470
Well, this is where you'll
sleep. I made this myself.

07:19.471 --> 07:20.638
Yep.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.507
I'll take the hammock,
up here.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.075
The... Of course,
you know the...
Bathroom.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.511
The bathroom is right
through here. That's right.

07:26.512 --> 07:30.748
And your towels are the ones
with the matador on 'em.

07:30.749 --> 07:34.185
And this is your closet space.

07:34.186 --> 07:37.855
I didn't realize that flannel
could reproduce so quickly.

07:40.926 --> 07:43.894

I don't find you that funny,

07:43.895 --> 07:45.763
But... But now
that we're roomies,

07:45.764 --> 07:49.667
I realize you actually do
have a sense of humor.

07:49.668 --> 07:53.538
It's from working with you, al.
Who's this guy here?

07:53.539 --> 07:56.774
It's gordy hawkins.
A race driver

07:56.775 --> 07:59.277
Oh, no, no. World-class
square-dance caller.

his correspondence course,

Great. Al, what's
the matter with you?
What?

09:41.813 --> 09:43.881
She invited you over.
She doesn't want
to bake a cake.

09:43.882 --> 09:47.818
She wants to sample
the al dessert tray.

09:47.819 --> 09:49.720
I know that, tim.

09:49.721 --> 09:53.023
It's just that
she's on the rebound.
She's vulnerable.

09:53.024 --> 09:55.359
I don't wanna take
advantage of that.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.495
Oh, al.

09:57.496 --> 10:01.165
It's not like a beautiful woman
stops by your apartment
every day.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.702
Actually, she does.

10:04.703 --> 10:06.070
Hey, partner,
I'll tell you what.

10:06.071 --> 10:08.206
Why don't we go down
to big mike's,

10:08.207 --> 10:11.576
Get ourselves some burgers,
have a beer?

10:11.577 --> 10:13.110
Well, no, oh, no, no.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.913
Listen, this is
our first night together.

10:15.914 --> 10:17.315
Come on, partner.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.350
They got that big widescreen tv

10:19.351 --> 10:22.720
Well, I... I've got a roast

10:22.721 --> 10:24.922
And I have some great
entertainment lined up.

10:24.923 --> 10:27.358
I have a... I have a tape

10:27.359 --> 10:29.560

going to like.

It's you.
That's me, yes!
That's me at three!

My mother has 17 years
of me growing up

10:48.714 --> 10:54.051
And she put them all
on 12 eight-hour tapes.

10:54.052 --> 10:56.854
I have practically my whole life

Please? I'm really itching.

Tell no one.

Hi, dad.
Feel better?

11:18.143 --> 11:19.943
Kind of.

11:19.944 --> 11:22.079

11:22.080 --> 11:24.282
Ohh!

11:26.184 --> 11:29.487

out of the house more often,
huh?

11:29.488 --> 11:32.222
If I ever say
it's hard living with you,
just say one word.

11:32.223 --> 11:33.791
Al!

11:36.495 --> 11:38.396
It's that bad, huh?

11:38.397 --> 11:42.433
His mother recorded
his whole life on videotape.

11:42.434 --> 11:43.934
Last night it was
three hours of

11:43.935 --> 11:46.370
"muskie fishing
with uncle phil."

11:46.371 --> 11:47.871
Urgh.

11:47.872 --> 11:49.340
Do you know that
in the seventh grade

11:49.341 --> 11:51.342
He built a replica of
the washington monument

11:51.343 --> 11:52.610
With popsicle sticks?

11:52.611 --> 11:54.244
Well, lots of kids
do stuff like that.

11:54.245 --> 11:56.414
It was life-sized!

11:58.883 --> 12:01.051
Last night it was
"al: The early years."

12:01.052 --> 12:02.553
Tonight...

12:02.554 --> 12:05.189
"puberty."

12:05.190 --> 12:08.759
"starring al."

12:08.760 --> 12:12.196
Poor baby.
You look exhausted.

12:12.197 --> 12:15.700
<i>(sighs)</i> I don't think
I've slept for 20 minutes.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.835
You've never heard
snoring like that.

12:17.836 --> 12:20.538
Wanna bet?

12:20.539 --> 12:22.005
I don't snore.

12:22.006 --> 12:25.275
Then you got a propeller
up your nose.

12:26.978 --> 12:30.314
He says he doesn't snore either.
I got proof.

12:30.315 --> 12:33.684
I wasn't sleeping anyway,
so I taped him.

12:33.685 --> 12:36.487
You taped him?
Yeah.

12:36.488 --> 12:39.323
That is so weird.

12:39.324 --> 12:42.360
I think it's time for you
to move into a hotel.

12:42.361 --> 12:43.961
I'll join you there.

12:43.962 --> 12:46.897
I'll go to the barkley.
Meet me there.

12:46.898 --> 12:49.400
Ok. I'll check with wilson
and see if he can stay tonight.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.001
Wilson?
Yeah.

12:51.002 --> 12:53.237
He's coming over to stay
with mark while I go
to the drugstore. Bye.

12:53.238 --> 12:54.772
Bye.

12:56.641 --> 12:58.442
We're pretty darn excited
here at <i>tool time.</i>

12:58.443 --> 13:01.011
To wrap up auto week,
I've invited some very
special guests here.

13:01.012 --> 13:03.714
We caught 'em at michigan
international speedway

13:03.715 --> 13:05.549
Trying out a new motor
for their racecar.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.951
Please welcome the superstar
father-son racing team of

13:07.952 --> 13:09.820
Mario and michael andretti.

13:09.821 --> 13:11.789
<i>(sound of car engine)</i>

13:20.098 --> 13:23.467
Come on, fellas.

13:23.468 --> 13:25.168
Thank you.

13:25.169 --> 13:27.638
Why don't you guys take a seat?
Let's talk about racing.

13:27.639 --> 13:31.141
Man and machine.
Man and machine -
the ultimate relationship.

13:31.142 --> 13:34.578
'course, not as important as
the father-and-son relationship.

13:34.579 --> 13:36.680
Or the sucking-up-to-the-guests
relationship.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.484
Let's talk about racecars
for a minute.

13:40.485 --> 13:43.253
This is what every man
dreams about at night.

13:43.254 --> 13:44.588
It's what I dream about, tim.

13:44.589 --> 13:46.557
That blows that theory.

13:48.493 --> 13:50.394
Tell me, mario,
what's the toughest thing

13:50.395 --> 13:53.163
About taking a racecar around
a track at 180 miles an hour?

13:53.164 --> 13:55.499
Adjusting the radio.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.968
<i>(al laughs/snorts)</i>

14:01.239 --> 14:03.808
That's a good one, mario.
You know, I've read

14:03.809 --> 14:06.076
That the smell of the tires
can tell you

14:06.077 --> 14:08.479
If you're pushing your car
too hard.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.481
Al, I think maybe you should
let the guests talk.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.583
But, tim, al is right.

14:12.584 --> 14:16.454
Thank you, michael.
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.956
Well, we all know
about the smell thing.

14:18.957 --> 14:20.558
What about the hearing thing,
al? You know about that?

14:20.559 --> 14:23.761
Go ahead, michael.
Tell him about
the hearing thing.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.063
What hearing thing?

14:26.064 --> 14:28.866
You know, when you listen
to the hum of the motor

14:28.867 --> 14:31.134
So you know precisely
when to shift.

14:31.135 --> 14:34.772
Excellent point, tim.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

14:37.275 --> 14:39.309
Well, anyway, I've got
a little test I got here today

14:39.310 --> 14:40.644
That could be kinda fun.

14:40.645 --> 14:44.548
I had our sound man, klaus,
put together some engine sounds.

14:44.549 --> 14:46.851
We're gonna play the engine
sounds back and see
if these professionals

14:46.852 --> 14:48.853
Can tell us which engine's
which. You guys wanna play?

14:48.854 --> 14:50.921
Sure. Let's do it.
We're ready.

14:50.922 --> 14:54.625
You're not playing, al.
Take your hands off the guests.

14:54.626 --> 14:56.727
Ok, klaus, if you will,
that first engine.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.796
<i>(engine sound)</i>

14:58.797 --> 15:02.232
Anybody?
That'd be a ford
five-liter v-eight.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.434
Right on the money, yeah.

15:07.038 --> 15:10.207
Well, let's see if daddy-o here
is as smart as his boy.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.643
All right, mario,
it's your chance.
Klaus, second motor.

15:12.644 --> 15:15.546
<i>(engine sound)</i>

15:15.547 --> 15:18.716
Two-liter
alpha romeo spider engine.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.785
Bull's-eye. Bull's-eye!
Unbelievable.

15:21.786 --> 15:25.255
Bravo. You know,
for a moment there,

15:25.256 --> 15:27.257
I thought it was
the three-liter.

15:27.258 --> 15:30.060
Actually, so did I.
Hey, you're pretty good.

15:30.061 --> 15:34.598
As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't mind having you
on my pit crew.

15:34.599 --> 15:37.635
Hey, what about me?

15:37.636 --> 15:40.804
I wouldn't mind having you
on danny sullivan's pit crew.

15:44.242 --> 15:46.677
Another good one, mario.

15:48.346 --> 15:51.348
Al, the hand thing. Ok.

15:51.349 --> 15:54.317
Well, since al sounds
like he knows so much,

15:54.318 --> 15:57.555
Why don't we invite al to play
this last and final round,
all right?

15:57.556 --> 16:00.024
Yeah.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.561
My pleasure.
Ok. Klaus,
that third engine, please.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.495
<i>(snoring)</i>

16:15.339 --> 16:18.341
I don't know what that is.
Sounds pretty rough.

16:18.342 --> 16:22.613
Yes. Sounds like
there's an obstruction
in the carburetor.

16:22.614 --> 16:26.249
Well, you're both close.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.886
That's al snoring.
I taped that last night.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.992
Honey, I'm home!

16:37.629 --> 16:39.262
Al, why did you take off
so early?

16:39.263 --> 16:41.331
The andrettis stuck around
to say goodbye to you.

16:41.332 --> 16:45.970
I had to come home, tim.
Dinner does not make itself.

16:50.274 --> 16:54.745
Al, I hope you're not upset,
but I was thinking, um...

16:54.746 --> 16:58.181
It might be a good idea
if I skipped dinner
and just went to a hotel.

16:59.651 --> 17:03.988
Fine. I think that is
a very good idea.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.890
Are you upset about something?

17:06.891 --> 17:08.892
You just embarrassed me
in front of two people

17:08.893 --> 17:11.294
That I happen to most idolize.

17:11.295 --> 17:14.164
Me and who else?

17:15.700 --> 17:17.134
Is this about the snoring gag?

17:17.135 --> 17:18.568
The crowd loved it.
It was real funny.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.537
Tim, it's very difficult
to go through life

17:20.538 --> 17:24.141
With a deviated septum.

17:24.142 --> 17:26.409
It could be worse.
You could be working
at the circus

17:26.410 --> 17:30.180
As "al, the donkey boy."

17:30.181 --> 17:32.916
Tim, I... I opened up
my life to you

17:32.917 --> 17:34.818
And you used that to hurt me.

17:34.819 --> 17:36.887
The whole reason I wanted you
to come over here

17:36.888 --> 17:39.322
Was so we could get to know
each other better as people,

17:39.323 --> 17:41.759
And I thought maybe that
would make us better friends.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.594
And you don't think
that happened?

17:46.131 --> 17:48.065
All right,
let's eat the dinner.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.499
Let's eat dinner. Come on.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.669
No. No, thank you.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.305
I think that...
That you should leave.

17:55.306 --> 17:58.475
No, I want to see more
of your home movies.
Al, what are you doing? Come on.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.078
Where are you going
with the bags?

18:01.079 --> 18:04.214
What are you putting them
out here for? Al... Oh...

18:04.215 --> 18:05.649
Right.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.617
<i>(knocks)</i> come on, let me in.

18:07.618 --> 18:10.187
Go away, tim.
Al, you can't end it
like this.

18:10.188 --> 18:12.022
We've had a relationship
for three years.

18:12.023 --> 18:14.191
It's over between us.

18:21.599 --> 18:24.201
Al, open the door.
No!

18:24.202 --> 18:26.469
You should never have made
that recording of me in bed.

18:29.473 --> 18:32.142
Wait, wait, wait.
You got this all wrong.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:32.143 --> 18:34.611
Cynthia. Cynthia. Hello?

18:34.612 --> 18:37.380
The reason I'm staying here
is 'cause one of my kids
has chickenpox

18:37.381 --> 18:38.582
And I haven't had it.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.217
Oh, you're married?
Yes.

18:40.218 --> 18:42.786
To a woman?
Yes.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.888
Cut it out. This has nothing
to do with him and I.

18:44.889 --> 18:46.523
He's not attracted
to me or men.

18:46.524 --> 18:48.291
As a matter of fact,
it's not my place to say it,

18:48.292 --> 18:50.594
But he's attracted to you.

18:50.595 --> 18:52.662
Then why does he
keep rejecting me?

18:52.663 --> 18:55.465
I really shouldn't be saying
this, but it's because
he respects you

18:55.466 --> 18:58.435
And he wants to get
to know you better.
Really?

18:58.436 --> 19:01.538
Al is a tremendously
sensitive man.

19:01.539 --> 19:06.176
And underneath all that flannel
is a really big heart.

19:06.177 --> 19:08.245
Would you help me out
for a minute?

19:10.148 --> 19:12.282
<i>(knocking)</i>
go away, tim.

19:12.283 --> 19:14.284
<i>(cynthia)</i> al, it's me.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.092
Aha!

19:22.093 --> 19:24.795
I was opening the door
for cynthia, not for you.

19:24.796 --> 19:28.732
Al, tim said some really
sweet things about you.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.068
And I didn't even
tell her all of 'em.
Remember that time at work?

19:31.069 --> 19:33.470
We had the lathe going.
I got my tie in it.
Tim.

19:33.471 --> 19:35.639
No thought of his safety,
yanks me out, saves my life.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.308
And the router, the router.
We had a router going.
The safety broke...

19:38.309 --> 19:39.743
Tim...
He goes over the table.

19:39.744 --> 19:42.279
He saves my life
pulling the plug out.
Really?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.248
And there's more.
Do you remember the time

19:44.249 --> 19:46.083
You jumped in front of
that speeding semitruck...

19:46.084 --> 19:49.153
Tim.
...And saved
the elderly nun?

19:49.154 --> 19:52.289
You did?

19:52.290 --> 19:55.826
Cynthia, the story
about the nun is nothing...

19:57.295 --> 19:59.562
That I usually talk about.

20:04.035 --> 20:07.171
And he wouldn't
because he's so modest.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.306
I'm sure he doesn't want me
to tell you this,

20:09.307 --> 20:11.775
But without al,
I couldn't do <i>tool time.</i>

20:11.776 --> 20:14.477
Well, I could,
but it'd be tough.

20:14.478 --> 20:16.947
<i>Tool time</i> is your show?

20:19.284 --> 20:21.384
<i>Tool time</i> is our show.

20:22.987 --> 20:24.288
Thanks, tim.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.990
Well, I guess
I should be going.

20:26.991 --> 20:29.592
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

20:34.833 --> 20:38.135
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

20:38.136 --> 20:42.405
That would be lovely.
I'll get the cake
I made for dessert.

20:42.406 --> 20:45.008
Great.

20:45.009 --> 20:46.643
Right!

20:46.644 --> 20:49.146
I'm sorry.
Was that router bit
pushing it?

20:49.147 --> 20:51.614
Oh, no, no,
that was a nice touch.

20:51.615 --> 20:54.617
The nun was pushing it.
Yeah.

20:54.618 --> 20:57.420
Anything I can do to help.
I think I'm gonna get
outta here.

20:57.421 --> 21:01.024
Oh, well, listen,

21:01.025 --> 21:03.227
I think, in the interest
of our friendship,
