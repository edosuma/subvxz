00:09.176 --> 00:10.761
Excuse me.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.304
Are you Dr Mitchell?

00:12.512 --> 00:15.474
- Dr Oliver Mitchell?
- Yes.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.476
What a pleasure.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.896
I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.527
Excuse me but have we...?

00:27.694 --> 00:31.907
Met? Oh, I'm sorry. Only in print.
I've read your work.

00:32.073 --> 00:37.370
Your studies, specifically on cell
degeneration, are ahead of their time.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.499
- You're very kind.
- No, really, it's fascinating.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.879
You've become
kind of a hobby of mine.

00:47.631 --> 00:53.762
I found your article on the mutant
retina gene to be particularly intriguing.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.096
But I haven't even...

00:55.263 --> 00:58.683
Published it yet?
Don't worry, you will.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.394
And you'll help to find the vaccine.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.897
A vaccine? Against what?

01:05.482 --> 01:06.775
Against this.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.794
"Ask again later." Hello, vague.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.048
How am I supposed to plan my future
without a little direction?

01:30.214 --> 01:32.925
You who can see the future
is now looking for it in a Magic 8 Ball?

01:33.092 --> 01:35.219
My visions don't help me, remember?

01:35.386 --> 01:39.348
I've got an idea. Why don't we ask if
Prue and Andy will get back together?

01:39.515 --> 01:41.642
Oh, Phoebe, please, don't.

01:41.809 --> 01:43.060
- Interesting.
- Very.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.273
You two are cruel.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.277
Ask it what a day off feels like?
That was my boss, Martin.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.487
- I have to go to the restaurant.
- You're kidding.

01:53.654 --> 01:56.657
There's a convention in town,
and business is just crazy.

01:56.824 --> 02:00.077
But you worked a double shift
yesterday and the day before that.

02:00.244 --> 02:01.829
He's working you to death, Piper.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.123
You were gonna talk to Martin
about this weeks ago.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.833
I never got around to it.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.710
Yeah, well, tell him to stuff it.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.128
Tell him you're taking the night off,
and that's that.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.840
I know, you're right, I will.
Hello, Martin?

02:13.007 --> 02:15.259
No, I know what you want, but...

02:15.885 --> 02:18.387
Okay. No, it's not a problem.
I'll be right there.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.807
Wow, you told him.

02:21.974 --> 02:23.934
Beware the wrath of Piper.

02:24.101 --> 02:27.479
I will talk to him, eventually.
I gotta go.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.233
Wait, Piper.
I'll walk you to the car. It's safer.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.568
I'll wait here.

02:35.821 --> 02:37.615
Excuse me. Pardon me.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.081
Oh, my God, Piper.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.878
- What is it?
- I just had a premonition.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.088
A woman's about to get murdered.

03:11.648 --> 03:12.774
Oh, my God.

03:14.526 --> 03:17.195
Phoebe saw this murder
before it happened.

03:17.362 --> 03:19.364
No, not this one.

03:21.325 --> 03:22.826
I think I saw the next one.

05:20.151 --> 05:23.112
- Is this leaded?
- Always is.

05:29.326 --> 05:31.704
Good morning, ladies.
I took a look at the staircase.

05:31.871 --> 05:34.456
Shouldn't be more than two days' work.
You mind if I get started?

05:34.623 --> 05:37.877
No, not at all.
I'll get you some coffee.

05:38.168 --> 05:41.630
Oops, you're busy. I'll get it.

05:41.797 --> 05:43.173
I'll be right there, Leo.

05:46.719 --> 05:49.305
When are you two gonna stop fighting
over him and grow up?

05:49.471 --> 05:54.101
When Phoebe realizes that she
doesn't have a chance with him.

05:54.268 --> 05:58.188
Well, that doesn't matter now because
I have to go protect the innocent.

05:58.355 --> 06:02.985
So we'll call a truce temporarily.
I'll just take this to Leo.

06:10.409 --> 06:12.619
You know that you're only into him
because Piper is.

06:12.828 --> 06:16.582
That is so not true. I'm wounded.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.750
Is there anything
about last night's murders?

06:18.917 --> 06:20.127
Nothing of any use.

06:20.294 --> 06:22.796
How am I supposed to figure out
who the girl in my vision is?

06:22.963 --> 06:24.006
What did she look like?

06:24.172 --> 06:29.928
Well, she was about 5'3"
and her hair was lightish.

06:31.263 --> 06:32.597
That's it?

06:32.806 --> 06:35.767
If it's not on videotape,
I can't exactly rewind it.

06:37.602 --> 06:40.439
Hey, you've gotta talk to Andy.

06:40.605 --> 06:42.566
- What?
- Well, if I can't find her,

06:42.732 --> 06:44.901
then I have to find the killer
before he gets to her.

06:45.068 --> 06:46.987
<i>Well, have you checked
the Book of Shadows?</i>

06:47.153 --> 06:50.156
The way you described your vision,
it sounds like it could be demonic.

06:50.323 --> 06:53.451
Yeah, but for all we know,
Andy's already hot on his trail.

06:53.618 --> 06:55.161
You have to go see him and find out.

06:55.328 --> 06:56.997
- Can't.
- Won't.

06:57.163 --> 06:59.207
Give me a break.
We just stopped seeing each other.

06:59.374 --> 07:01.001
Don't you think it might be awkward?

07:01.167 --> 07:04.337
<i>Okay, then how about I go see him,
and you look in the Book of Shadows?</i>

07:04.504 --> 07:07.215
- Phoebe.
- Prue, I had this vision for a reason.

07:07.382 --> 07:10.343
I am supposed to save her.
I know it.

07:11.928 --> 07:13.972
I have to find her.

07:24.065 --> 07:25.608
Nothing.

07:25.775 --> 07:27.861
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.336
"Truth spell."

07:55.680 --> 07:57.223
What the...?

08:12.238 --> 08:14.907
The truth is,
I need extra tablecloths because...

08:15.074 --> 08:17.159
Oh, wine!

08:20.579 --> 08:23.791
I need this space. Can't you do that
in the manager's office?

08:23.958 --> 08:27.044
- You took my desk, remember?
- Then go somewhere else.

08:27.211 --> 08:29.630
I've got a restaurant
full of hungry conventioneers.

08:29.797 --> 08:31.298
I just ran out of white corn chowder,

08:31.465 --> 08:33.759
and I need you to get ahold
of produce, pronto.

08:33.926 --> 08:37.054
- Well, what about the books?
- You can take them home with you.

08:37.221 --> 08:40.558
I come back after three weeks,
and the whole place is chaos.

08:41.725 --> 08:43.519
Martin, you know what I think?

08:43.686 --> 08:45.020
What? What do you think?

08:46.564 --> 08:48.649
I think I'm gonna need
that number for produce.

09:01.662 --> 09:03.247
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:03.414 --> 09:07.084
Can I borrow your laptop?
I need to do some surfing on the Web.

09:07.251 --> 09:11.630
See if I can find anything about
the burns on the victim's forehead.

09:12.047 --> 09:13.340
What?

09:13.507 --> 09:16.802
Nothing. I just never really thought
of you as computer-friendly.

09:16.969 --> 09:19.638
Are you kidding?
Chat rooms saved my life.

09:21.723 --> 09:24.893
So did you talk to Andy?

09:25.060 --> 09:27.437
Actually, I spoke to his partner instead.

09:27.604 --> 09:30.691
- You told Morris?
- About the case? I didn't have to.

09:30.857 --> 09:33.777
Every inspector at the station
was talking about it.

09:33.944 --> 09:37.155
The only problem is, they're stumped.

09:37.322 --> 09:39.366
<i>Did you find anything
in the Book of Shadows?</i>

09:39.533 --> 09:43.120
I'm not sure.
So you didn't see Andy?

09:44.037 --> 09:45.789
No, I said I didn't talk to Andy.

09:46.373 --> 09:48.583
I saw him in the parking lot
when I left.

09:49.042 --> 09:50.502
But...

09:51.586 --> 09:52.963
...he had that look, Prue.

09:53.797 --> 09:55.799
You know the one I'm taking about.

09:56.007 --> 09:57.968
You might recognize it from the mirror.

09:59.803 --> 10:01.263
He really cares about you.

10:02.389 --> 10:03.765
Don't you think I know that?

10:03.932 --> 10:06.309
So, what are you waiting for?
Tell him the truth.

10:06.476 --> 10:08.311
It's the only thing
standing between you guys.

10:08.478 --> 10:11.690
Tell him that I'm a witch? I can't
do that. What if he can't handle it?

10:11.856 --> 10:14.192
It's not like I can put the genie
back in the bottle.

10:14.359 --> 10:17.237
He's not gonna turn you in
to the warlock police.

10:17.404 --> 10:20.949
At least you'd know
how he feels once and for all.

10:21.157 --> 10:25.078
Otherwise, you'll never know
if it could've worked out or not.

10:26.162 --> 10:29.415
If I were you, I would figure out
a way to tell him.

10:32.001 --> 10:33.670
Thank you for the laptop.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.391
- Sandwich?
- Hey, Tanya, sure.

10:48.059 --> 10:50.895
I saved you your favourite.
Turkey, no mayo.

10:51.187 --> 10:52.230
You're a good woman.

10:52.397 --> 10:54.690
- Thanks.
- Bye.

11:16.045 --> 11:18.005
Okay, you win.

11:20.716 --> 11:22.760
Hey, stranger. Back from the war?

11:22.927 --> 11:25.513
More like I brought the battle
home with me. Inventory.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.849
I'll help you with yours
if you help me with mine.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.227
<i>"For those who want the truth revealed</i>

11:31.394 --> 11:33.729
<i>Opened hearts and secrets unsealed</i>

<i>From now until it's now again
After which the memory ends"</i>

11:37.733 --> 11:39.401
So I guess you didn't talk
to your boss.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.321
Of course I did.
Just like I said I would.

11:45.241 --> 11:47.159
Am I getting a zit on my chin?

11:47.660 --> 11:49.578
Can't even see it.

11:58.045 --> 11:59.755
You really can't see it?

11:59.964 --> 12:03.092
Are you kidding? It looks like
that thing has a life of its own.

12:03.258 --> 12:04.760
What?

12:05.511 --> 12:07.096
So you really told off Martin, huh?

12:07.388 --> 12:10.140
No, I lied. I chickened out.

12:22.277 --> 12:23.612
<i>Hi, you've reached Andy Trudeau.</i>

12:23.779 --> 12:26.365
<i>Leave your name and number,
I'll get back to you. Thanks.</i>

12:27.115 --> 12:30.327
Hi. Hi, Andy, it's Prue.

12:30.494 --> 12:32.204
Hey, I was wondering, I...

12:32.371 --> 12:34.456
Could you just call me, please?

12:34.623 --> 12:37.125
Soon. Within the next 24 hours.

12:37.292 --> 12:39.211
I need to talk to you
about something.

12:39.378 --> 12:43.715
So just call, okay? Bye.

12:43.882 --> 12:47.052
You know tonight would be fine too.

12:47.219 --> 12:49.012
Okay, bye.

13:01.107 --> 13:02.984
Excuse me.

13:03.735 --> 13:05.362
Are you Mr Pearson?

13:05.528 --> 13:07.489
Alex Pearson?

13:07.989 --> 13:09.240
Yeah, yeah, can I help you?

13:09.449 --> 13:11.451
In so many ways.

13:12.077 --> 13:14.829
Working late tonight, aren't you?

13:15.038 --> 13:17.123
Yeah, I work better at night.

13:17.290 --> 13:20.585
And these soil samples just arrived
from the Bindura plateau.

13:20.752 --> 13:23.463
Ah, Zimbabwe.

13:24.339 --> 13:28.593
Their crops have been
overrun by disease for decades.

13:30.386 --> 13:31.805
Well...

13:32.138 --> 13:34.474
...your work will put an end to that.

13:36.017 --> 13:38.228
- That's the hope.
- That's the reality.

13:38.895 --> 13:42.982
Are you from the foundation? They
don't usually check up on us this late.

13:43.483 --> 13:45.026
No, no.

13:45.193 --> 13:49.405
But I have studied your work,
and I know what it will lead to.

13:49.572 --> 13:52.992
My work? You mean the lab's.
I'm only just a technician.

13:53.159 --> 13:55.703
For now, Alex.

13:56.245 --> 14:01.542
But someday. Someday you
will help find the vaccine.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.589
The vaccine? For what?

14:08.049 --> 14:10.426
I'm sorry, who are you?
What do you want?

14:14.514 --> 14:15.890
Your future.

14:24.523 --> 14:26.067
Dear God, what is it?

14:50.007 --> 14:51.592
Thanks.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.844
- Is this leaded?
- Nope.

14:54.428 --> 14:55.888
- It's not?
- Never has been.

14:56.055 --> 14:58.807
I just say it is because it's ridiculous
to make two pots of coffee

14:58.974 --> 15:01.685
when you're the only one
who drinks diesel.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.148
Prue, don't give me grief
when you get the phone bill.

15:06.315 --> 15:10.402
I was up all night on the Internet,
and I didn't find anything.

15:10.569 --> 15:12.196
That poor girl.

15:12.363 --> 15:16.617
Oh, Piper, I'm sorry about the crack
I made last night about your zit.

15:16.784 --> 15:19.328
That's okay. So you really can't see it?

15:20.412 --> 15:21.663
Like I said, it's huge.

15:25.042 --> 15:27.503
Something weird is going on.

15:27.711 --> 15:30.839
Morning, ladies. Should be able
to finish the stairs today.

15:31.048 --> 15:34.635
Okay. I'll make some more coffee.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.595
And I'll bring it to you.

15:36.762 --> 15:38.513
Okay.

15:40.932 --> 15:42.517
Here we go again, right?

15:42.726 --> 15:47.898
Piper, we both know the only reason
I like Leo is because you do.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.277
Okay, I have no idea
why I just said that.

15:52.444 --> 15:53.862
What's going on?

15:54.029 --> 15:55.906
Okay, I'm late for work. Busy, gotta go.

15:56.698 --> 15:58.658
- Prue!
- Yeah?

15:58.825 --> 15:59.868
Spill. What's up?

16:00.494 --> 16:01.870
I cast a truth spell.

16:02.078 --> 16:03.622
- What?
- What?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.290
You cast a truth spell?

16:05.457 --> 16:07.292
Yes! Look, please, no more questions.

16:07.459 --> 16:09.211
- Why?
- Because I wanted to know

16:09.377 --> 16:12.255
what Andy would think of me
if he found out I was a witch.

16:12.631 --> 16:13.757
I can't believe it.

16:13.924 --> 16:16.760
Oh, look who's talking,
Little Miss Spell-of-the-Week.

16:16.926 --> 16:20.013
No, no. I mean I can't believe
you actually took my advice.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.806
The biggest pooper
at the Wicca party

16:21.973 --> 16:25.310
has finally used her power
for personal gain. It's about time.

16:25.477 --> 16:28.229
Personal? It's affecting us.
Prue, what have you done?

16:28.772 --> 16:31.775
The spell was only supposed
to work on me, okay?

16:31.941 --> 16:34.360
It said, "those in this house."
I thought I was alone.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.029
Well, obviously, you weren't.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.115
Wait, we just have to...
We have to undo it right now, fast.

16:39.324 --> 16:42.410
Can't. Twenty-four-hour time limit.
Which means until 8:00 tonight

16:42.577 --> 16:44.662
everybody who comes
into contact with us will have

16:44.871 --> 16:47.790
- no choice but to speak the truth.
- What do you mean "no choice"?

16:47.957 --> 16:49.584
Exactly that. Ask me a question.

16:49.751 --> 16:52.503
I'm game.
Prue, what do you think of me?

16:52.670 --> 16:54.922
While I admire your confidence
and your fearlessness,

16:55.089 --> 16:57.842
your utter lack of responsibility
frustrates me to no end.

16:58.009 --> 16:59.677
Oh, God, that is so enough.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.221
Oh, my God.
This could be very dangerous.

17:02.388 --> 17:06.851
I'm kind of digging it. Piper, what
do you really think of your boss?

17:07.018 --> 17:10.855
I think he's a self-serving jerk
who must have a very small penis.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.525
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna be so fired.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

17:14.692 --> 17:18.613
Because once the spell ends, no one
will remember what they've heard.

17:18.779 --> 17:21.365
You guys, I just wanted to see
how Andy would react.

17:21.699 --> 17:23.617
What a way to come
out of the broom closet.

17:23.784 --> 17:27.371
Are you nuts? We just need
to lock the doors, call in sick

17:27.538 --> 17:30.249
and just stay in our own bedrooms
until it just goes away.

17:30.416 --> 17:33.919
Hello, there's a demon on the loose,
and I still have to find that woman.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.130
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

17:36.339 --> 17:38.924
- Premonition?
- No. An epiphany.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.178
So are you telling me
that everyone I ask a question to

17:42.386 --> 17:44.013
has to answer with the truth?

17:44.180 --> 17:46.599
I think so, yes. But that also means,

17:46.766 --> 17:49.310
if we get asked a question,
we have to answer with the truth.

17:49.477 --> 17:50.895
I can work around that.

17:51.061 --> 17:53.606
This is cool. Very cool.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.692
Phoebe, no. Where are you go...?

17:59.486 --> 18:03.324
Don't even think of asking me
what I think about you right now.

18:15.961 --> 18:17.421
- Phoebe.
- Hi, Andy.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.173
- What...?
- Have you talked to Prue?

18:19.381 --> 18:21.175
She left a message
on my machine last night.

18:21.341 --> 18:23.093
Wasn't sure if I wanted to
call her back.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.554
Oh, believe me. Trust me.

18:25.721 --> 18:28.390
You definitely want to call her back.

18:28.557 --> 18:30.100
That why you came here?

18:30.267 --> 18:32.019
Hardly.

18:33.353 --> 18:35.939
What do you know about the guy
they found murdered

18:36.106 --> 18:38.775
in the movie theatre parking lot
the other night?

18:38.942 --> 18:40.777
Lead detective says
he's not the only victim.

18:40.944 --> 18:43.113
They found a lab technician
out in Oakland.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.616
They had the same
cauterized mark on their forehead,

18:45.782 --> 18:48.744
and their eyes were drained of colour.
They were completely white.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.787
- Wait.
- Cause of death?

18:51.204 --> 18:53.248
Unknown. Looks like
they took a bullet to the head,

18:53.415 --> 18:55.208
only there's no exit wound
and no bullet.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.460
Phoebe, this is highly...

18:56.626 --> 18:58.128
- Any suspects?
- Not yet.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.213
Any evidence that could
lead to a suspect?

19:00.380 --> 19:02.299
They found a button
at the crime scene,

19:02.466 --> 19:04.593
possibly from the suspect's jacket,
made of an alloy

19:04.759 --> 19:07.053
Forensics has never seen before.
What the hell is...?

19:07.762 --> 19:10.098
Do not ask that question.

19:10.265 --> 19:11.641
I gotta go. Thanks.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.561
Don't forget to call Prue
by 8:00 tonight.

19:25.488 --> 19:28.199
Hello? I mean, Prue Halliwell.

19:28.366 --> 19:30.785
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- Andy, hi.</i>

19:30.994 --> 19:33.913
Phoebe stopped by,
suggested I give you a call.

19:34.330 --> 19:35.999
Phoebe.

19:36.166 --> 19:39.043
Yeah, but can we meet? I really
don't wanna talk over the phone.

19:39.252 --> 19:41.588
Should I be looking forward to this
or dreading it?

19:41.754 --> 19:43.006
Honestly, I don't know.

19:43.173 --> 19:46.968
But what are you doing for dinner?
An early dinner? Like, let's say, now?

19:47.135 --> 19:48.678
<i>It's lunchtime.</i>

19:49.137 --> 19:51.848
<i>But I'm gonna be interviewing
a witness in your area around 5.</i>

19:52.056 --> 19:53.182
I could swing by after.

19:54.392 --> 19:55.435
Yeah?

19:55.643 --> 19:58.062
Here? Yeah, I guess that's fine.

19:58.229 --> 19:59.939
All right, I'll see you then.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.442
- Hey, Tanya.
- Personal call, Prue?

20:02.650 --> 20:03.901
Personal business, Hannah.

20:04.068 --> 20:06.195
And I swear that
that's my name on the door.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.823
Look.

20:09.365 --> 20:11.534
Last turkey, no mayo. My favourite.

20:12.326 --> 20:15.997
- Actually, I was saving that for Prue.
- Yeah, you were.

20:17.373 --> 20:18.541
Don't you hate turkey?

20:18.749 --> 20:21.002
Of course I do.
I just don't want you to have it.

20:22.837 --> 20:25.840
Is there any particular reason
why you're such a bitch to me?

20:26.007 --> 20:28.801
Yes. Because it's my mission in life
to destroy you.

20:29.844 --> 20:32.847
Well, nothing like a bit
of interoffice rivalry

20:33.014 --> 20:35.266
to get those
competitive juices flowing.

20:36.726 --> 20:39.061
Hannah, a word.

20:51.198 --> 20:55.077
- What do you think you're doing?
- I don't know. It came out.

20:55.244 --> 20:58.372
No, no, no. It didn't just come out,
you almost came out.

20:58.581 --> 21:01.709
Am I to believe that suddenly
you've lost control of your faculties?

21:01.876 --> 21:03.627
No.

21:04.128 --> 21:06.714
God, she's just so...

21:06.881 --> 21:08.215
So Prue.

21:12.469 --> 21:14.346
Forgive me?

21:18.058 --> 21:19.893
Always.

21:21.812 --> 21:23.313
Hey.

21:33.949 --> 21:36.535
Go on, get back to work.

21:45.752 --> 21:49.423
Martin, I can't work tonight.
I have to do the books.

21:49.590 --> 21:52.801
Do the books and run the floor?
That's imposs...

21:52.968 --> 21:54.970
But you don't underst...

21:55.804 --> 21:57.305
Right now?

21:57.472 --> 21:59.474
I'm on my way.

22:00.642 --> 22:03.228
Nice talking to you too, jerk.

22:08.984 --> 22:13.155
Hey, I had a little bit of an accident.
Do you mind if I borrow your washer?

22:13.321 --> 22:16.324
No, not at all. Go right ahead.
Can I get you some coffee?

22:16.491 --> 22:19.578
You'd better not. I'll just wind up
knocking it all over again.

22:20.370 --> 22:23.290
Truth is, caffeine makes me
a little clumsy, you know.

22:23.623 --> 22:25.917
- Leo, wait.
- Yeah.

22:26.626 --> 22:29.296
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

22:30.964 --> 22:32.257
Do you need another shirt?

22:32.716 --> 22:35.260
No, I got one in the truck. Thanks.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.471
Leo, wait. That wasn't my question.

22:38.638 --> 22:40.890
- It wasn't?
- No.

22:41.766 --> 22:45.770
I was just wondering,
do you ever think of me?

22:45.979 --> 22:47.689
- Yeah.
- In what way?

22:47.856 --> 22:51.484
- As a friend sort of way or...?
- You have beautiful eyes.

22:51.651 --> 22:53.278
That's a good way.

22:53.444 --> 22:57.240
I'm sorry.
That was totally inappropriate,

22:57.407 --> 22:59.659
- wasn't it?
- No, not at all.

23:00.118 --> 23:01.160
Oh, what the hell.

23:01.327 --> 23:03.663
Leo, how do you feel about women
who make the first move?

23:04.289 --> 23:06.624
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for it to happen.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.751
Goodness.

23:18.010 --> 23:20.430
How do you feel about guys
who make the second move?

23:20.596 --> 23:22.515
Love them.

23:32.942 --> 23:34.819
- Hi, Rex.
- Hello, Prue. How are you?

23:34.986 --> 23:36.112
I am a nervous wreck

23:36.279 --> 23:38.698
because I'm about to tell
my boyfriend that I am a wi...

23:38.864 --> 23:44.078
- ner. A winner.
She is a real catch, this one is.

23:44.245 --> 23:46.414
I'm Phoebe, her sister.
We met, remember?

23:46.580 --> 23:48.290
Yeah, how could I forget?

23:48.457 --> 23:50.167
Let's go to my office.

23:50.334 --> 23:53.379
- Okay, the spell is really working.
- Yeah, I know. So you talked to Andy?

23:53.546 --> 23:55.631
I sure did. He gave me
a list of all the victims.

23:55.798 --> 23:57.508
They all died the same way too.

23:57.675 --> 23:59.468
Only problem is,
they don't have a suspect,

23:59.635 --> 24:02.054
which means that
I have no way of finding...

24:06.350 --> 24:07.893
- Her.
- Who her?

24:08.060 --> 24:09.728
That's the girl from my premonition.

24:09.895 --> 24:11.522
Tanya?

24:11.730 --> 24:14.108
Wait, hold the elevator.

24:17.653 --> 24:19.154
Excuse me.

24:19.321 --> 24:20.739
Are you Mrs Parker?

24:21.448 --> 24:23.659
- Tanya Parker?
- Yes.

24:24.868 --> 24:28.455
You have been most difficult to find.

24:28.664 --> 24:31.792
Never in the same place.
Never alone.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.043
Excuse me?

24:35.546 --> 24:37.798
- Are you sure?
- Yes, and that's the truth.

24:37.965 --> 24:41.135
All right, take the stairs.
I'll call security.

24:42.553 --> 24:44.388
Get off me!

24:53.605 --> 24:55.607
Get off me!

24:58.151 --> 25:01.071
Run, Tanya, ru... Oh, my!

25:07.869 --> 25:09.496
Drive!

25:16.169 --> 25:17.921
Phoebe!

25:29.808 --> 25:32.018
Honey, I'm fine.

25:32.185 --> 25:34.896
No, there's no reason
to fly back early.

25:35.105 --> 25:37.482
I'm staying...

25:37.649 --> 25:38.733
...with friends.

25:40.318 --> 25:42.070
I'll explain it all when you get home.

25:42.237 --> 25:44.656
- Kids? Do you have any kids?
- Not yet.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.867
- Pets?
- No.

25:49.035 --> 25:50.495
I love you too.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.544
Before I can explain any of this
to my husband,

25:57.710 --> 26:00.088
you're gonna have to
explain it to me.

26:00.255 --> 26:01.965
What is going on?

26:02.131 --> 26:04.050
Short story: You're in danger.

26:04.425 --> 26:07.470
And to keep you out of it, we have to
keep you out of the obvious places,

26:07.637 --> 26:09.138
which is why you have to stay here.

26:09.389 --> 26:11.766
- But what was that thing?
- Truth spell.

26:11.933 --> 26:13.726
That thing...

26:14.143 --> 26:15.186
...was a demon.

26:16.187 --> 26:17.522
I'm out of here.

26:17.689 --> 26:20.233
No, Tanya, he's killed before.

26:20.441 --> 26:22.443
Trust me. Call the cops. Check it out.

26:22.652 --> 26:25.738
That burn on your forehead,
that's how he does it.

26:25.905 --> 26:28.574
I've seen it, okay? I have visions.

26:28.741 --> 26:31.994
Visions of people
that I'm supposed to help.

26:32.537 --> 26:36.457
I've seen his next victim. It's you.

26:40.002 --> 26:41.629
There are no coincidences.

26:42.505 --> 26:46.133
I was supposed to see you,
to find you.

26:47.051 --> 26:48.636
And now I'm supposed to save you.

26:56.227 --> 26:57.728
- Romaine in fridge three.
- Okay.

26:57.895 --> 27:00.731
Phoebe. You have her there,
at the house?

27:00.898 --> 27:02.733
I understand you have to
protect the innocent,

27:02.900 --> 27:05.319
but couldn't you find one that makes
a decent béarnaise sauce?

27:05.486 --> 27:06.779
My kitchen is collapsing.

27:06.946 --> 27:09.782
Well, I gotta go.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

27:09.949 --> 27:12.368
Martin, hi. Just the man I wanted to...

27:12.535 --> 27:14.286
I made a list.
You better check it twice.

27:14.495 --> 27:16.330
I'll be back after the dinner rush.

27:16.539 --> 27:18.541
But I've got a family situation.

27:18.707 --> 27:21.377
So you'd like to take off, go home,
take care of business?

27:21.543 --> 27:23.545
Thank you, Martin,
for understanding.

27:23.712 --> 27:25.923
Well, don't thank me,
because the answer is no.

27:26.715 --> 27:30.010
All right, Martin. What part of "family
situation" do you not understand?

27:30.177 --> 27:32.930
Are you insane?
No one person can do all of this.

27:33.097 --> 27:35.099
How do you expect
me to do it all alone?

27:35.307 --> 27:36.642
- Because I know you will.
- What?

27:36.809 --> 27:38.769
Why spend money on employees
when I know you'll do it?

27:38.936 --> 27:40.395
And you won't complain.

27:40.562 --> 27:42.648
I've got a bargain,
all the work for half the price.

27:43.941 --> 27:45.901
Piper, I don't know why I said that.

27:46.068 --> 27:48.946
Too late, Martin.
Truth's out, and so am I.

27:49.112 --> 27:50.781
You don't deserve me. I quit.

28:06.546 --> 28:09.257
- Andy, hi.
- Hello, Prue.

28:12.094 --> 28:14.763
I am so sorry I'm late.
My meeting ran over.

28:14.930 --> 28:17.432
Your assistant said I could wait here.
I hope that's okay.

28:17.599 --> 28:20.727
Yeah, of course. Can I get you
anything? Something to drink?

28:20.894 --> 28:22.521
I'm fine.

28:22.687 --> 28:26.024
- How are you?
- A nervous wreck. You?

28:26.191 --> 28:29.027
Heart's pounding
like a sledgehammer.

28:33.490 --> 28:35.617
So, Andy...

28:35.867 --> 28:38.161
...how well do you think
you really know me?

28:38.620 --> 28:41.206
Well, I know about
your fondness for Twizzlers,

28:41.373 --> 28:44.084
how you can't stand it
when people talk at the previews,

28:44.250 --> 28:45.960
how you like to argue to win,

28:46.461 --> 28:49.172
and how you pick your cuticles
when you're nervous.

28:49.964 --> 28:53.426
I also know I'd love to
start seeing you again.

28:53.593 --> 28:57.430
I wish you could trust me enough to
tell me whatever it is you're afraid of.

28:58.223 --> 29:02.143
Well, actually that's what
I wanted to see you about.

29:02.852 --> 29:07.398
Except that instead of telling you,
I think I'll just show you...

29:07.565 --> 29:09.150
...so here it goes.

29:09.525 --> 29:11.611
You see this?

29:11.819 --> 29:13.196
Watch.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.116
What the hell was that?

29:17.700 --> 29:20.536
My secret. I did that with my mind.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.497
- You're telekinetic?
- Yes.

29:22.664 --> 29:27.043
Well, no. Actually, it's just so
much more than that. I'm a witch.

29:28.753 --> 29:30.213
- A what?
- A good witch.

29:30.379 --> 29:32.840
I have powers. I never wanted them.

29:33.049 --> 29:35.468
I didn't even find out about them
until recently.

29:36.719 --> 29:38.888
Right around the time
that I ran into you again.

29:41.474 --> 29:42.600
Okay.

29:42.767 --> 29:45.728
You know all those times
that I disappeared

29:45.895 --> 29:48.981
or would show up at a crime scene
with no logical explanation.

29:49.148 --> 29:51.359
Well, this is why.

29:51.651 --> 29:55.321
And believe me, I wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't.

29:55.613 --> 29:56.864
I couldn't tell anyone.

29:59.408 --> 30:01.410
Are you okay?

30:02.661 --> 30:04.372
I don't know.

30:05.790 --> 30:09.627
I mean, of all the things I thought
you were hiding, this was...

30:09.794 --> 30:11.170
...actually nowhere on the list.

30:14.548 --> 30:16.383
Does this mean
that Piper and Phoebe are...?

30:16.550 --> 30:22.097
Yeah. We inherited our powers
from Mom and Grams.

30:22.848 --> 30:24.225
So when you have kids...?

30:24.975 --> 30:27.770
If they're girls, yes.

30:28.062 --> 30:31.440
Well, that's a...

30:32.858 --> 30:34.818
That's quite a secret
you've been hiding.

30:35.319 --> 30:36.695
Tell me about it.

30:37.488 --> 30:40.115
Can you change? I mean,
is this something you can get rid of?

30:41.658 --> 30:45.079
No. Andy, I can't change who I am.

30:46.663 --> 30:49.249
And that's something
that I've recently come to accept.

30:51.126 --> 30:53.128
The question is, can you?

30:53.962 --> 30:56.256
Well, to tell you the truth...

30:59.009 --> 31:00.427
...I don't know, Prue.

31:02.471 --> 31:04.264
I honestly don't know.

31:14.858 --> 31:17.778
- Did Prue talk to Andy?
- She didn't say.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.780
<i>Did you find anything
in the Book of Shadows?</i>

31:19.946 --> 31:21.448
Nothing I recognize.

31:23.533 --> 31:26.536
So Andy said the third victim
was a professor at Stanford?

31:26.745 --> 31:29.414
- What's the link?
- He thinks it has something to do

31:29.581 --> 31:31.791
with what they're working on.
Biogenetics.

31:32.626 --> 31:35.921
A professor, a geneticist,
a lab technician...

31:36.129 --> 31:38.256
And a sandwich girl?

31:38.423 --> 31:41.384
- Do you really think he's after me?
- Truth spell.

31:50.602 --> 31:53.730
Piper, we need milk. Kitchen.

32:01.321 --> 32:03.239
- She's carrying.
- Carrying what?

32:03.406 --> 32:05.325
A baby, she's pregnant.

32:05.492 --> 32:07.035
No, no. She doesn't know yet.

32:08.119 --> 32:09.787
What do we do? Do we tell her?

32:09.954 --> 32:11.956
I mean, we protect,
we don't do prenatal.

32:12.165 --> 32:14.667
No, this not the kind of information
Tanya needs right now,

32:14.834 --> 32:16.336
especially from people she just met

32:16.502 --> 32:18.588
who are telling her
some three-eyed demon

32:18.755 --> 32:21.215
wants to suck the life out of her.

32:21.424 --> 32:23.718
Suck the life out of her.

32:23.885 --> 32:27.680
Wait a minute. Is it possible
that it's not Tanya he wants?

32:27.847 --> 32:30.725
- That it's her baby?
- How would he know she's pregnant?

32:31.934 --> 32:36.773
I don't know.
Maybe he sees the future too.

32:37.190 --> 32:39.984
Or else he's from it.

32:40.151 --> 32:41.944
- Excuse me?
- The button.

32:42.111 --> 32:44.322
The police found a button
by one of the last victims

32:44.489 --> 32:47.909
made out of some kind of funky metal
they'd never seen before.

32:48.492 --> 32:49.869
- Rewind.
- Okay.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.038
There's a button
that's not supposed to exist,

32:52.205 --> 32:54.665
<i>a demon that the Book of Shadows
says doesn't exist</i>

32:54.832 --> 32:58.461
and a baby no one knows exists.
You got a better explanation?

32:58.878 --> 33:00.921
Even if you're right,
how will we find him?

33:01.881 --> 33:04.008
Well, he wants Tanya. He'll find us.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.509
He doesn't know where we are.

33:05.718 --> 33:09.055
Well, he found Tanya at Buckland's.
He saw me...

33:12.516 --> 33:13.642
With Prue.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.941
Hey, last one out gets the lights?

33:22.234 --> 33:24.445
I'm going home.

33:25.863 --> 33:29.116
- So lock up when you leave?
- Sure.

33:29.658 --> 33:31.452
Prue?

33:31.869 --> 33:33.913
About what I said earlier...

33:34.079 --> 33:35.831
Now isn't a good time.

33:36.874 --> 33:38.626
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

33:39.126 --> 33:40.961
But you wouldn't really mean that,
would you?

33:41.170 --> 33:42.796
No.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.210
Excuse me.

34:22.377 --> 34:25.839
Are you Miss Halliwell?
Prue Halliwell?

34:26.047 --> 34:27.882
Yes. Did we have an appointment?

34:28.049 --> 34:33.179
No. Actually, I'm looking for someone,
and I believe you can help me.

34:33.346 --> 34:35.181
I find objects, not people.

34:36.683 --> 34:41.396
Well, I think you might know her.
I saw you talking to her earlier.

34:41.563 --> 34:44.190
Petite, brown hair.

34:44.357 --> 34:46.484
The two of you
were over by the elevators.

34:46.650 --> 34:47.777
I don't remember.

34:48.527 --> 34:49.696
Are you sure?

34:50.030 --> 34:51.197
What do you want with her?

34:51.406 --> 34:53.699
She's hiding the woman
I was sent back to kill.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.286
- Sent back from where?
- The future.

34:57.370 --> 34:59.080
- What are you doing?
- Why kill Tanya?

34:59.289 --> 35:01.166
I don't want Tanya.

35:01.583 --> 35:05.503
I want what's inside her. No!

35:06.463 --> 35:09.549
- And the others, why kill them?
- They were all...

35:09.716 --> 35:12.010
...pieces of the puzzle.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.179
Pieces of the vaccine.

35:16.556 --> 35:18.308
Stop this!

35:31.446 --> 35:34.032
Answer. Come on Prue, pick up.

35:34.198 --> 35:36.492
<i>You have reached
Buckland Auction House...</i>

35:36.659 --> 35:39.454
There's no answer. It's after 5.
It's going straight to voice mail.

35:39.620 --> 35:42.081
- You have to go to Buckland's.
- I'll grab my keys, grab Tanya.

35:42.248 --> 35:45.543
No. You have to go. Alone.

35:45.751 --> 35:47.753
If we bring Tanya with us
and he's there,

35:47.920 --> 35:49.505
it's bringing the feast to the lion.

35:49.672 --> 35:52.550
And she can't stay here
by herself, so...

35:52.758 --> 35:54.552
But I need you, Phoebe.
We need you.

35:55.178 --> 35:57.179
I can't always be the power of three.

35:57.388 --> 35:59.682
But what if he comes here,
and you're all alone?

35:59.849 --> 36:01.559
<i>We'll be in the attic with the Book.</i>

36:02.351 --> 36:04.270
- Okay, be careful.
- You too.

36:34.717 --> 36:38.804
I've got eight and a half months
to find Tanya, Miss Halliwell.

36:38.971 --> 36:41.223
Plenty of time.

36:46.437 --> 36:48.647
Yours, however...

36:50.357 --> 36:52.151
...has run out.

37:03.662 --> 37:05.289
Prue?

37:10.294 --> 37:11.336
Oh, no.

37:18.927 --> 37:22.139
You can't hide from me forever.

37:22.889 --> 37:25.892
What's the vaccine for?
What does it protect against?

37:30.731 --> 37:34.276
Against me, of course.

37:35.569 --> 37:39.281
And all other warlocks like me...

37:39.739 --> 37:41.825
...in the future.

37:43.618 --> 37:49.958
The Parker child will be the one
to bring together all the elements...

37:51.084 --> 37:53.503
...to create...

37:54.963 --> 37:58.508
...the vaccine which will destroy us.

38:02.137 --> 38:04.639
Unless I stop him.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.488
Hey. Need a hand?

38:20.655 --> 38:22.615
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:23.575 --> 38:26.369
He's not after Tanya.
He's after her baby. She's pregnant.

38:26.536 --> 38:27.620
Yeah, I know.

38:27.787 --> 38:30.498
- Truth spell. Later. Where's Phoebe?
- Home protecting Tanya.

38:30.665 --> 38:32.667
Well, what are you waiting for, Piper?
Whack him.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.919
No. Can't you move him?

38:35.086 --> 38:37.046
Where? He's from the future.

38:37.213 --> 38:39.465
- Prue, he's gonna unfreeze soon.
- Piper, just do it.

38:39.632 --> 38:41.634
- No, you do it.
- No, do it! Piper!

38:41.843 --> 38:43.428
- Just do it!
- Oh, my...

39:04.907 --> 39:07.743
I love it when they clean up
after themselves.

39:20.589 --> 39:22.758
- Prue.
- Andy.

39:22.925 --> 39:26.095
I need to know how you feel
about what I told you.

39:26.262 --> 39:29.849
- I'm gonna need a little more time.
- I don't have time, Andy.

39:30.015 --> 39:31.642
I need to know before 8.

39:31.809 --> 39:34.228
- Come inside. We'll talk about it.
- I can't.

39:34.436 --> 39:36.397
- Prue.
- Andy, no.

39:36.605 --> 39:38.524
Look, if I come inside
we'll have drinks,

39:38.691 --> 39:41.318
there'll be small talk,
and precious minutes will pass.

39:43.237 --> 39:45.322
I need to know now.

39:46.490 --> 39:49.785
Can you or can you not
accept that I'm a witch?

39:53.163 --> 39:55.290
If I have to answer right now...

39:57.876 --> 39:59.545
...I don't think so, Prue.

40:01.338 --> 40:03.298
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with it, I guess.

40:03.465 --> 40:07.219
It's just not a future
I envision having.

40:12.349 --> 40:13.767
What were we just talking about?

40:14.393 --> 40:16.728
- You don't remember?
- Honestly, no.

40:17.646 --> 40:21.984
You don't remember anything
you said to me in the last 24 hours?

40:23.360 --> 40:26.071
No. It's really weird.

40:27.447 --> 40:29.616
You want to come inside?

40:30.367 --> 40:31.910
No.

40:32.077 --> 40:33.954
I have to go.

40:37.165 --> 40:39.000
Goodbye, Andy.

41:04.275 --> 41:06.236
Excuse me.

41:07.195 --> 41:10.949
What good is saving the future if I can't
get a glass of water in the present?

41:11.408 --> 41:13.660
Speaking of the future,
where did Tanya go?

41:13.827 --> 41:15.078
She went to the bathroom.

41:15.286 --> 41:17.372
Morning sickness.
Only she thinks it's the halibut.

41:17.539 --> 41:20.583
Oh, great. She'll probably sue
the restaurant for food poisoning.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.961
Will this day never end?

41:23.128 --> 41:24.462
Actually, it's just did.

41:24.671 --> 41:29.425
It's 8:20. The spell is over.
The world is a safer place.

41:29.592 --> 41:31.636
Piper, I see you sitting.

41:31.803 --> 41:33.680
What is wrong with this picture?

41:33.846 --> 41:35.765
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

41:35.932 --> 41:40.520
Piper, I need you in the kitchen,
pronto. We're down a sous-chef.

41:41.813 --> 41:42.855
I don't believe it.

41:43.064 --> 41:47.694
I finally stand up for myself and quit,
and he doesn't even remember.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.071
Wait a minute.
Everybody else has forgotten the truth,

41:50.238 --> 41:52.490
- why do we still remember it?
- Truth or consequences.

41:52.657 --> 41:55.660
Wiccan rule, right? Prue cast a spell
for her own personal gain,

41:55.827 --> 41:57.829
now we have to deal with the fallout.

41:59.288 --> 42:01.165
I'll be right back.

42:01.332 --> 42:03.459
I need to remind Martin of something.

42:04.418 --> 42:06.671
You go, girl!

42:13.010 --> 42:15.930
Martin, we need to talk.

42:16.138 --> 42:17.723
- Excuse you.
- I cannot...

42:17.890 --> 42:20.309
No, I will not do everything
by myself anymore.

42:20.476 --> 42:22.353
I need help.
Your restaurant needs help.

42:22.561 --> 42:24.230
You need another manager,
sous-chef,

42:24.397 --> 42:26.148
hostess and an extra busboy
on the weekends.

42:26.315 --> 42:30.152
If you will not agree to hire these
people, then tell me now and I'll quit.

42:31.570 --> 42:34.323
Honey, what took you so long?
All you had to do was ask.

42:34.490 --> 42:38.536
Really? I mean, okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:38.744 --> 42:40.579
But I just...

42:41.247 --> 42:43.082
It's my night off.

42:47.419 --> 42:50.673
Oh, Leo! I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

42:50.839 --> 42:53.300
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just surprised.

42:53.509 --> 42:56.053
Yeah, me too.
What are you doing here?

42:56.679 --> 43:00.224
Well, I wanted to see you. I just...

43:01.058 --> 43:02.768
I have this really strange feeling

43:02.935 --> 43:05.646
that I did something
I should apologize for.

43:07.439 --> 43:09.817
- Did I?
- No.

43:09.983 --> 43:12.611
No. Not at all.

43:12.778 --> 43:14.655
Definitely not.

43:15.572 --> 43:17.616
Can I buy you a drink?

43:23.664 --> 43:26.667
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd it go?

43:27.751 --> 43:30.337
- Not well.
- Oh, Prue, I'm so sorry.

43:30.504 --> 43:35.634
Yeah, me too. But I cast a spell
for an answer, and I got it.

43:35.926 --> 43:37.844
Even if it wasn't the one that I wanted.
