WEBVTT

00:06.140 --> 00:09.410
[theme music]

00:09.510 --> 00:11.612
I'd do the dishes
for you, honey,

00:11.712 --> 00:12.813
but I got a nasty hangnail.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.849
It's going to smart like
hell in that soapy water.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.585
Yeah, well save your
lame excuses, Dan.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.420
And don't even make
any offers that you

00:19.520 --> 00:21.122
have no intention of keeping.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.022
Fair enough.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.795
I'll just take care of it
like I do with every other thing

00:27.895 --> 00:29.797
around this house.

00:29.897 --> 00:34.968
(SHOUTING) Darlene, get
down here and do the dishes!

00:35.069 --> 00:35.869
I'll get it.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.574
Hello?

00:40.674 --> 00:41.709
Oh hi, Dougie.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.411
How's our favorite banker?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.079
What's he doing calling here?

00:45.179 --> 00:46.080
I asked them to.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.848
Oh good, good.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.049
How's Lois?

00:49.150 --> 00:50.151
What'd you do that for?

00:50.251 --> 00:52.019
We're late on the loan
payment on the shop.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.854
Oh my god, Dan.

00:53.954 --> 00:54.755
Don't worry.

00:54.855 --> 00:55.656
I have a plan

00:55.756 --> 00:57.325
And how are the kids?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.827
What's the plan?

00:59.927 --> 01:01.295
[kissing noise]

01:03.897 --> 01:05.199
Oh, really?

01:05.299 --> 01:08.169
Oh that is just so precious.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.539
I've always said that little
girl of yours was a genius.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.575
Hey, you guys have to come over
for dinner again real soon.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.676
Oh we would love that.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.311
Great, great.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.948
Well listen, hold on a minute
and I'll get Dan for you.

01:21.048 --> 01:21.882
Which one's the genius?

01:21.982 --> 01:22.950
The little one, Katie.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.254
The one who made
boom-boom in our sink.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.590
Hey Dougie, how you doing man?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.492
Listen, thanks for calling back.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.995
Hey listen, I've got to
keep this on a friend level.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.098
I'm going to need a couple more
weeks on that loan payment.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.233
Hi.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.868
I'm Mike Summers, your
state representative.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.035
How you doing?
- Great.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.437
Good.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.439
I'm going door to door trying
to get to know my constituents.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.340
Oh.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.275
Door to door, huh?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.709
That takes a lot of time.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.544
Why don't you just go down
to the unemployment office

01:50.644 --> 01:51.645
and see everybody at once?

01:54.915 --> 01:57.918
I hear you.
And you're right.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.389
We can't let this area's
workforce lay idle.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.191
That's why bringing
in new business

02:03.291 --> 02:04.725
is my number one priority.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.626
How?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.295
Through tax incentives.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.896
See, we're going
to make it cheaper

02:08.996 --> 02:10.398
for out of state
businesses to set

02:10.498 --> 02:12.400
up shop right here in Lanford.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.367
So they get a tax break?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.268
Yeah.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.669
That's why they come here.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.373
Well, who's going to pay the
taxes that they ain't paying?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.874
Well, you will.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.044
But you'll be working.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.180
Good, steady employment.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.315
Union wages?

02:27.415 --> 02:29.250
Well now, part of the
reason these companies

02:29.350 --> 02:31.519
are finding it so expensive to
operate in other locations--

02:31.619 --> 02:33.887
So they're going to dump
the union so they can come

02:33.987 --> 02:36.123
here and hire us at scab wages.

02:36.224 --> 02:40.561
And then for that privilege
we get to pay their taxes.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.529
Is your husband home?

02:44.732 --> 02:47.635
He's on the phone trying to
keep us from losing our house.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.738
Hey, let's talk about that.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.072
See, we're broke.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.074
I can't even afford
to go buy groceries

02:54.174 --> 02:56.143
unless it's double coupon day.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.612
You know, we should
talk about that.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.382
But I have several
houses I have to get

03:01.482 --> 03:02.683
to before I quit for the--

03:02.783 --> 03:03.584
Hey, great.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
I'll come with you.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.688
Boy, it's getting
rough out here, Mike.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.056
Yeah.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.425
You know, it's getting so my
son is going to have to wear

03:11.525 --> 03:13.261
my daughter's hand me downs.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.963
And for real this
time, not just for fun.

03:19.032 --> 03:24.872
[theme music]

03:59.640 --> 04:07.515
[laughter]

04:07.615 --> 04:09.082
Last day at the old mall, huh?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.183
How do you feel?

04:10.284 --> 04:11.685
I don't want to go in.

04:11.785 --> 04:12.620
Good.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.688
Just treat it like
any other day.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.657
Mom, I check down at
the Buy and Bag for you.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.759
They didn't have any openings.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.127
Thanks anyway.

04:20.227 --> 04:21.429
See ya.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.730
Eh.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.698
You know, mom, the
lunch lady at school's

04:24.798 --> 04:25.933
been out sick for a few weeks.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.134
I think she's going to die soon.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.037
Are you interested?

04:30.137 --> 04:31.639
Well gee, let's see.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.842
Serving crappy food to
ungrateful teenagers?

04:34.942 --> 04:38.779
How would I know I was at work?

04:38.879 --> 04:39.713
Here.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.114
It's a letter from my school.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.950
I was supposed to give it
to you a couple days ago.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.017
Why didn't you?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.919
I forgot.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.721
What, is that like
the time you forgot

04:47.821 --> 04:49.222
that hamsters can't swim?

04:49.323 --> 04:50.123
No.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.693
This time I really forgot.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.027
Dear Mr. and Mrs.
Connor, I'm sure

04:54.127 --> 04:57.030
you're as proud as
we are of your son's

04:57.130 --> 05:00.300
significant achievement in
winning the James Madison

05:00.401 --> 05:02.235
elementary school spelling bee.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.805
My god, it's a good note!

05:04.905 --> 05:06.640
You sure there
ain't a page missing?

05:06.740 --> 05:07.541
No.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.576
He's in the regional finals.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.877
That's the whole note.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.480
No one was hurt.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.283
DJ, I always knew you had
some special, hidden talent.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.586
And now you can spell.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.288
You can spell!

05:21.389 --> 05:25.393
Yeah, and that's
where the big money is.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.695
You're just jealous.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.596
You're right.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.997
I wanted to be Rain Man.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.870
So Deej, why didn't you say
anything about this before?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.672
I didn't think it
was such a big deal.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.640
Are you kidding?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.008
This is major!

05:41.108 --> 05:42.876
The whole family's coming
down to that contest

05:42.976 --> 05:44.412
and cheering you on to victory.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.513
Even Darlene?

05:45.613 --> 05:47.448
The entire family.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.582
Cool.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.350
(SHOUTING) Hey Darlene,
they're making you come!

05:50.451 --> 05:51.351
Ha ha!

05:58.992 --> 06:01.128
Here comes Leon.
I hope he found us something.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.029
Of course he did.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.764
He said he would, so he did.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.065
That's what I like
about you, Bonnie.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.702
You are always half full.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.337
So, did you get us another job?

06:10.438 --> 06:11.371
What is it?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.773
Well, I spoke to everyone.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.208
Now look, Tuesday's going
to be a problem for me.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.710
You know, so if they
want me to start Tuesday

06:16.810 --> 06:19.480
I'm not going to be able
to start till around noon.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.150
That's not a problem since
no one in the store is hiring.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.351
Oh no.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.487
Well there's got
to be something.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.588
I'm sorry.

06:27.688 --> 06:31.058
I did everything I but
you've waited on too

06:31.158 --> 06:32.359
many of the department heads.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.700
Damn.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.502
Well, at least you tried.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.804
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- I'm sorry.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.905
I really am ladies.

06:45.005 --> 06:50.544
But you know, so today
isn't a total waste,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.012
let's blow this joint in style.

06:52.112 --> 06:52.913
Whoa.

06:53.013 --> 06:56.083
Sparkling cider.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.487
Well, at least you
spared no expense.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.890
It's just a
token of my esteem.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.258
Not the actual esteem.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.061
You know, Leon, that
was really sweet of you.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.463
Yeah.

07:09.563 --> 07:13.133
It's so nice it almost makes me
feel guilty for all the crap we

07:13.233 --> 07:15.368
pulled behind your back.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.369
Oh really?

07:16.470 --> 07:17.671
Yeah.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.339
Like remember that time I
told you that my aunt Helen

07:19.439 --> 07:21.709
died and I had to go to Vegas?

07:21.809 --> 07:22.910
Don't tell me.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.978
She didn't really die,
and there was no funeral.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.080
There was, but I didn't
go because I was in Vegas.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.484
Yep.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.685
I remember that.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.987
Let's see, that was
right about the same time

07:34.087 --> 07:35.889
that Rodbells told
me you no longer had

07:35.989 --> 07:38.759
to wear these quaint little
humpty-dumpty uniforms

07:38.859 --> 07:40.561
that you hate so much.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.697
You never told us that.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.198
I didn't?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.466
Oh.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.201
But you know what's important
is that you know now.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.743
Leon, that was really low.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.613
Well, you finally
earned our respect.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.981
Thank you.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.284
Well, here's to the last day.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.920
We're not out in the parking
lot watching the place burn,

08:07.020 --> 08:10.824
but this is nice, too.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.893
To Rodbells' luncheonette.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.663
Where the food
speaks for itself.

08:15.763 --> 08:16.697
All night long.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.146
Nancy's driving me crazy, Dan.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.615
All couples argue, Arnie.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.583
It's different, though.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.684
When we were dating
the only fight

08:36.784 --> 08:38.151
we ever had was who
drives and who moons.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.223
That's bull.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.559
You two used to
fight all the time.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.128
Yeah, but it used to be
like foreplay, you know?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.997
Got us hot.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.531
Now she's breaking
plates over my head, Dan.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.167
It's a real turn off.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.069
You guys ever thought
about going to a counselor?

08:56.169 --> 08:56.937
Right, Dan.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.707
We're a little old for camp.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.008
Hey.
DAN: Hi, honey.

09:01.108 --> 09:01.942
ARNIE: Hey, Rosie.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.343
How was the last
day at the shop?

09:03.443 --> 09:04.745
Horrible.

09:04.845 --> 09:08.348
Leon can't find me no other job
and I didn't have any customers

09:08.448 --> 09:11.084
to take it out on.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.855
But I did talk to
Nancy, and you're wrong.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.956
OK.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.658
Well, now that Rosie
and I have discussed it,

09:17.758 --> 09:20.193
we can't put you
up tonight, Arnie.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.228
What about your garage?

09:21.328 --> 09:22.129
We just cleaned it.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.498
OK.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.399
All right.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.300
You know I'm going to do?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.401
I'm going to be
a man about this.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.604
You know, it's my
place too, right?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.105
I'm going to sleep in
my own damn garage.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.878
Hey!

09:37.978 --> 09:39.780
What happened to
that big, tricked out

09:39.880 --> 09:41.081
Harley you had sitting up here?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.183
Well, I kind of sold it.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.852
Yeah, well why
didn't you tell me?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.153
Then the pressure's off.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.054
We can breathe.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.689
Don't get too excited.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.324
I didn't make as big a profit
on it as I should have.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.994
What's not as big mean?

09:54.094 --> 09:57.064
About $100 less
than I spent on it.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.031
Oh, Dan.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.099
I had to, honey.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.701
We needed the money
to get into the summer

10:00.801 --> 10:04.137
and the guy wouldn't
go any higher.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.539
Man, I know how hard
you worked on that thing.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.741
Well don't worry, baby.

10:07.841 --> 10:11.378
We'll screw over the
next guy real good.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.579
I'm sorry, Dan.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.248
I know that was
your favorite bike.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.017
Well, remember
our family motto.

10:17.117 --> 10:17.918
We're Connors.

10:18.018 --> 10:18.886
We've got to eat.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.726
Well, I'm going to go back
there and get me some coffee.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.626
You want some?

10:26.727 --> 10:27.527
Sure.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.232
[bell rings]

10:32.332 --> 10:33.166
Can I help you?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.301
Hi.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.669
I'm Mike Summers, your
state representative.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.870
How you doing?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.906
I'm meeting with
small businessmen

10:39.006 --> 10:40.941
in the area trying to get some
sense of what their concerns--

10:41.041 --> 10:42.743
Hey!
Mike!

10:42.843 --> 10:44.211
Oh, hell no!

10:44.311 --> 10:45.112
Wait up!

10:54.421 --> 10:57.090
You DJ's nervous about
the spelling bee tonight?

10:57.190 --> 10:59.092
No, he seems fine to me.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.127
I don't know.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.763
Being in the spotlight
like that can

11:02.863 --> 11:05.132
be really traumatic for a kid.
- Oh, yeah.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.867
Like remember that time
when you were doing them

11:06.967 --> 11:08.802
baton tosses in front of
the whole school and you

11:08.902 --> 11:09.703
killed that bird?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.574
It could've just
died right away,

11:14.674 --> 11:16.443
but it just kept
flopping around.

11:20.080 --> 11:20.881
NANCY: Rosie!

11:20.981 --> 11:21.882
Hi, Nance.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.084
Come on in.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.786
He left me.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.686
Do you believe this?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.455
He left me.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.522
You're kidding!

11:29.622 --> 11:30.623
Read this.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.060
Dear Nancy, I know
this is hard to believe,

11:33.160 --> 11:35.929
but I am being kidnapped by--

11:36.029 --> 11:37.597
what's that word?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.733
Aliens.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.334
Aliens from outer space.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.307
He is such a worm.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.208
He just snuck out.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.242
He couldn't even face me.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.778
Instead he leaves
me some stupid note

11:50.878 --> 11:56.716
about space creatures sent here
to take back intelligent life.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.852
Man, are their bosses
going to be ticked.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.557
Did you have another fight?

12:04.657 --> 12:05.859
Huge.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.327
But he didn't have to do this.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.430
What's going on?

12:10.530 --> 12:11.398
Dear Nancy,

12:11.498 --> 12:15.769
[reading to self]

12:15.869 --> 12:17.604
Who are the Allens and
why are they out of spice?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.176
Aliens, Dan.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.846
From outer space.

12:25.946 --> 12:30.350
Oh, that makes a
little more sense.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.920
Dan, did he tell you anything?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.521
Is there another woman?

12:34.621 --> 12:36.623
No offense, Nancy, but
it's a miracle there's one.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.629
Why would he do
something like this?

12:42.729 --> 12:44.364
Well, why does
this surprise you?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.633
Remember the first time he was
supposed to meet your family

12:46.733 --> 12:49.502
and he came down with
Lou Gehrig's disease?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.503
Yeah.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.973
Turned out to be
the 24 hour kind.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.541
There you go.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.442
That's it.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.844
I'm finished with him.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.045
I'm going back to
the apartment, I'm

12:58.145 --> 13:00.047
putting everything he
owns into a shoe box

13:00.147 --> 13:03.616
and throwing it out
onto the sidewalk.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.652
Because I don't need him.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.988
I don't need anybody.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.257
Jackie, will you come with me?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.525
Sure.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.927
Man.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.563
Yeah.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.630
There you go.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.869
I told you they
wouldn't make it a year.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.972
DJ, come on down here!
- He's almost ready.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.273
He's doing his hair.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.441
Oh, well, that can't be good.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.476
OK.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.878
I've got to ask a
couple of questions

13:30.978 --> 13:32.345
for my college application.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.280
Shoot.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.214
OK.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.349
What's our annual income?

13:36.449 --> 13:39.552
That's the amount of money
that we make in a year.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.121
Next question.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.156
No, they need to know.

13:43.256 --> 13:47.360
0 to 20,000, 20 to
40,000, 40 to 80,000.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.697
Well, I guess put
us down for say, 31.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.631
Really?

13:51.731 --> 13:55.502
Yeah, and we only
spend, say, 35.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.870
OK.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.239
You still made too much for
me to get full financial aid.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.508
How much is in my college fund?

14:01.608 --> 14:04.744
Boy, this is embarrassing.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.414
Please tell me
there's a college fund.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.018
Well, there was, but--

14:11.118 --> 14:15.923
So even if I get into these
schools, I can't afford to go?

14:16.023 --> 14:20.327
Becky, it has been
a really bad year.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.428
I can't believe this.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.662
Well, let's wait and see.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.532
Maybe you can get an
academic scholarship.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.599
Big maybe, dad.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.500
Big, big maybe.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.802
The shop could still take off.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.438
If not, maybe you
can go to a community

14:31.538 --> 14:33.573
college for a couple of years.

14:33.673 --> 14:34.707
What was I working for?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.009
What was the point
of getting As?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.244
Becky.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.080
All this time you told
me if I worked hard and got

14:40.180 --> 14:41.214
good grades and
everything I could

14:41.314 --> 14:42.349
make something out of myself.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.416
And you still can.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.451
Yeah, going to night school?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.986
Working at the Buy and Bag?

14:46.086 --> 14:47.354
I'm going to wind
up just like you,

14:47.454 --> 14:48.255
Hey.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.090
Hey!

14:50.190 --> 14:51.124
Dan.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.525
You apologize for that.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.626
No!

14:53.726 --> 14:55.362
Your mother busted
her butt for you and she

14:55.462 --> 14:56.629
deserves a little bit more--

14:56.729 --> 14:57.730
I busted my butt so I
could get into a good school!

14:57.830 --> 14:59.332
How come you never told
me there was no way?

14:59.432 --> 15:00.533
Oh!

15:00.633 --> 15:02.269
We purposefully went broke
so that you couldn't go

15:02.369 --> 15:03.403
to the college of your choice.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.105
Well, you should have
told me I was on my own!

15:05.205 --> 15:07.140
Oh, come off it, you've
never been on your own.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.542
Well then, what
would you call it?

15:09.642 --> 15:10.477
I'm ready!

15:16.716 --> 15:18.485
What did you do?

15:18.585 --> 15:22.189
I think it looks good.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.492
Well, you are wrong.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.393
Mom.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.494
No!

15:27.594 --> 15:30.230
All the other parents
will make fun of us.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.165
You go up there and wash
that out of your hair.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.666
Now!

15:33.766 --> 15:34.567
All right.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.838
Are you ready to go?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.707
I'm not going to some
stupid spelling bee.

15:40.807 --> 15:41.941
Oh, yes you are.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.643
Your brother has been to
plenty of your stupid things

15:43.743 --> 15:44.644
and you can go to his.

15:44.744 --> 15:45.612
You go get yourself ready.

15:51.518 --> 15:55.955
I can't believe you let
her talk to you like that.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.158
Dan, the fact that she
doesn't want to end up

15:58.258 --> 16:00.193
like me just proves
that she's been

16:00.293 --> 16:01.894
paying attention around here.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.297
She was still way out of line.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.699
I mean, we may not have
exactly been able to spoil her,

16:06.799 --> 16:11.171
but she still had
it pretty good.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.405
As good as we wanted her to?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.212
Hey mom, did you tell
DJ to wash his hair?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.647
- Yeah.
- Oh.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.649
Well, you should have told him
to take his blazer off first.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.056
Why does he do that?

16:36.063 --> 16:39.699
Your word is embarrass.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.468
Embarrass.

16:41.568 --> 16:48.041
E M B A R A S S. Embarrass.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.309
I'm sorry, Roger.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.278
There are two R's.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.247
But you don't need to be
embarrassed because you

16:54.347 --> 16:55.848
did very, very well.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.018
And whenever you do your best,
Roger, you're never a loser.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.389
Yeah, he is.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.725
Spell good night, Roger.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.060
Down to two.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.395
Yes.

17:08.495 --> 17:12.999
This couldn't be more boring
if this was lady's goals.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.534
OK, Nicole.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.604
Your word is quantity.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.505
Jinx.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.044
She's just a kid now, Dan.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.846
Quantity.

17:26.946 --> 17:32.819
Q U A N T I T Y. Quantity.
- Correct.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.287
Dammit.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.755
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.324
How's Nancy doing?
- She's a wreck.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.058
She's crying, she's sobbing.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.695
Why, did Arnie come back?

17:42.795 --> 17:47.534
David Jacob, your
word is monarch.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.369
Piece of cake.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.370
Monarch.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.706
M O N A R C H. Monarch.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.607
Oh, too bad, son.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.612
That's correct, David Jacob.

18:04.984 --> 18:05.852
What's going on down there?

18:05.952 --> 18:06.986
Oh, Becky hates us.

18:07.086 --> 18:07.920
OK.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.257
Don't tell me.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.460
Nicole, your
word is legendary.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.533
Legendary.

18:20.633 --> 18:26.239
L E G E N D E R Y. Legendary.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.376
I'm sorry, Nicole.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.878
It's A R Y. But you
stay right here,

18:31.978 --> 18:34.347
because if David Jacob
misses his next word

18:34.447 --> 18:36.416
you both get another chance.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.185
Go Deej, you can do it, buddy.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.219
Be the word.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.788
Sound it out.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.056
Jeez, it's just
a spelling bee.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.659
Maybe to you, pal,
but it's all we've got.

18:46.759 --> 18:50.630
[whooping]

18:50.730 --> 18:53.099
Quiet!

18:53.200 --> 18:54.066
Everybody!

18:57.670 --> 19:01.441
Oh, please, please let
it be a word he knows.

19:01.541 --> 19:06.112
David Jacob, your
word is foreclosure.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.624
Well tell us, champ.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.025
In the closing moments when
it could've gone either way

19:19.125 --> 19:20.227
you had a funny
look on your face.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.328
Was that nerves?

19:21.428 --> 19:22.429
Concentration?

19:22.529 --> 19:23.363
What?

19:23.463 --> 19:25.532
Nicole cut one.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.435
Oh, well that means
she likes you, DJ

19:28.535 --> 19:31.238
We are so proud of you.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.205
Yeah.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.707
So how does it
feel to peak at 10?

19:34.807 --> 19:37.076
Oh now, we love
you, too, Darlene.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.845
In a way.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.814
Yes, we do.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.783
Oh man, there's
only strawberry left.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.218
I knew this would happen.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.619
Oh here.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.554
You can have my chocolate.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.655
I'll eat the strawberry.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.259
Don't say I never
gave you nothing.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.393
You know, I was thinking.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.761
Forget college.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.464
Maybe I'll just marry Mark and
move in here with you guys.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.698
Whoa.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.132
If you're trying to kill
us for the insurance money,

20:00.233 --> 20:01.033
don't bother.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.369
Because there ain't any.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.074
OK, everybody.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.075
All right, listen up.

20:09.175 --> 20:09.976
Now listen up.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.378
Attention, please.

20:11.478 --> 20:15.782
Now, since DJ is the very
best speller in all of Lanford

20:15.882 --> 20:17.784
we're going to have a
little toast DJ style.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.151
OK?

20:19.252 --> 20:25.091
So everybody get your spoon
full, hold it high, and fire!

20:57.390 --> 20:58.291
Knock knock.
-

20:58.391 --> 20:59.592
- Who's there?
- Orange.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.593
Orange who?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.161
Orange you glad I
didn't say banana?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.062
Yes.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.697
Man, this is great.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.998
Hey, can I drive?
- We said no.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.066
Oh, come on.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.401
It's not like I'm
going to hit nothing.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.202
If you don't
stop this behavior

21:10.303 --> 21:12.672
we're going to have
to separate you again.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.940
All right, all right.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.575
Hey what's that yellow, pasty
stuff in the back there?

21:15.675 --> 21:16.509
Antimatter.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.410
Really?

21:17.510 --> 21:19.178
Tastes like chicken.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.981
Knock knock.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.417
Can't you find
anything else to do?

21:24.517 --> 21:26.953
Perhaps you could
go outside and play.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.388
Right And then the
minute I'm out there

21:28.488 --> 21:30.790
you'll fly a little too close to
the sun like you did last time.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.360
Forget it, guys.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.528
You know what I
could go for, though?

21:35.628 --> 21:39.198
A little companionship, if
you know what I mean, Hey you,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.868
are you a chick?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.704
Does he know he's to
be a pet for your son?

21:44.804 --> 21:45.605
Yes.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.007
He's fine with it.
