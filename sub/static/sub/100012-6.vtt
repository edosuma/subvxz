WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.207
There are some things we need to discuss.

00:03.320 --> 00:07.166
Our friend jimmy McCavern
has asked for control of the racecourses

00:07.280 --> 00:08.486
north of Wincanton.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.045
I said yes.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.084
- In return for what?
- No return.

00:15.520 --> 00:16.646
None.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.606
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.802
It would have been a kindness.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.851
Now get out.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.405
THOMAS: This is a cheque guarantee.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.363
Signed by Mosley.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.683
On behalf of a man called jimmy McCavern.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.483
<i>THOMAS:
The consequence of good intentions.</i>

00:49.560 --> 00:51.085
<i>My good intentions.</i>

00:53.200 --> 00:54.611
Push the button.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.927
Unlock the door and come home to me.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.170
(ENGINE STARTS)

01:01.920 --> 01:03.490
I have a job for you.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.602
(LAUGHS)

01:05.720 --> 01:07.484
I'll come for you...

01:07.600 --> 01:09.409
...after midnight on Wednesday.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.965
Barney Thomason...

01:12.240 --> 01:15.687
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.529
While he's on stage.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.165
While I'm stood next to him.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.844
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.328
<i>THOMAS: It's going to be a busy few weeks,
brother.</i>

(GLASS TIN KLES)

01:47.800 --> 01:50.087
Mmm. (SNIFFS)

01:53.240 --> 01:54.924
(SNIFFS)

01:56.000 --> 01:58.128
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

01:59.840 --> 02:01.205
Yes, Mr Churchill.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.726
Irish over Scotch.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.282
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.521
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.770
Grandmother in a tent.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.723
My mother on a narrow boat.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.527
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.888
A man needs to prove he is better than me

02:30.000 --> 02:32.321
rather than show me his birth certificate.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.002
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.090
You speak beautifully in the House.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.884
- Thank you.
- And believe

02:42.000 --> 02:43.843
not a word of what you are saying.

02:45.480 --> 02:49.929
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.361
You read Greek literature.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.845
I have trouble sleeping.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.845
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

03:01.840 --> 03:05.526
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

03:05.640 --> 03:10.851
So I made some enquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall,

03:10.960 --> 03:15.363
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.250
You are spying on him.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.169
Yes.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.281
Why?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.165
The honest answer is...

03:28.080 --> 03:29.366
...I'm no longer sure.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.768
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.011
I have a gardener.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.811
In fact, I have three gardeners.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.687
Three generations of men
with no ambition...

03:46.080 --> 03:48.128
...who are happier than I will ever be.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.086
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you

03:52.200 --> 03:54.726
that there are certain species of weed

03:54.840 --> 03:57.127
that no matter how much you tug at them,

03:57.240 --> 03:58.685
poison them,

03:58.800 --> 04:01.087
they continue to grow back.

04:01.200 --> 04:06.081
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the topsoil,

04:06.200 --> 04:07.884
create a field of mud

04:08.000 --> 04:10.844
and blow up and burn
the exposed taproots.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.926
That's what you and I did in France.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.680
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

04:18.800 --> 04:23.567
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.002
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.248
That's why you oppose him.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.840
Yeah.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.406
Your mystery solved.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.885
What is your strategy?

04:43.120 --> 04:45.168
I won't burden you with it.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.089
You're going to break the law.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.562
(SIGHS)

04:50.680 --> 04:51.727
I need to sleep.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.282
You said you don't sleep.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.289
I said I have trouble sleeping.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.561
As do I.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.247
As do I.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.251
Mr Shelby...

05:06.400 --> 05:10.291
...I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

05:10.400 --> 05:14.405
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

05:14.520 --> 05:16.568
both working to the same end.

05:17.720 --> 05:23.045
We are in the same exact situation
here in Westminster.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.050
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.806
And if you need anything, call me.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.730
There are some times, some nights...

05:44.240 --> 05:48.006
...when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.121
Oh.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.131
That old dance routine.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.810
I put out a cigar,

05:55.920 --> 05:59.083
and an hour later I want another.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.684
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.161
But use it anyway.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.329
A tent.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.726
Then a boat.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.365
Then a house.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.403
Now a mansion.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.522
That's something.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.687
Isn't it?

06:22.440 --> 06:25.011
Yeah, that is something.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.562
By the way...

06:31.720 --> 06:36.647
...was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.091
I forget his name.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.804
Major Campbell.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.526
Yes, Campbell.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.290
No.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.731
It was my aunt.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.366
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

06:49.480 --> 06:51.289
and spend an evening with your family.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.484
They sound interesting.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.090
Yes.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.089
They'd like that.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.766
(SNORTING)

07:13.840 --> 07:16.605
I got to Harold French,
refereeing Liverpool. He just wants cash.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.802
Tom the tatter,
reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash

07:18.920 --> 07:21.571
and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.967

on the whiskey, yeah?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.246

07:28.160 --> 07:29.321
You don't knock?

07:30.560 --> 07:32.085
No, Finn.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.328
I don't knock.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.201
Right.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.041
Hello, Billy.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.884
How are you, mate?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.411
Good, Mr Shelby.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.761
Yeah, you look good. (POURS DRINK)

07:46.880 --> 07:49.167
That's a nice suit.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.645
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.250
FINN: He earned that suit.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.603
We made more on the matches
than we did on the races last Saturday.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.721
He's a good man.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.491
Yeah, I know that. Mm.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.602
You're coming up in the world, I like it.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.848
How's the missus, hmm?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.890
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.161
She moved out.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.282
Oh, that's a shame.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.641
Mind if I join you, eh?

08:15.760 --> 08:20.049
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.484
You're a good man, Billy.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.124
You're a good man, eh?

08:29.280 --> 08:32.090
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.168
And what did we do, eh?

08:34.280 --> 08:39.446
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

08:39.559 --> 08:42.006
reveals himself.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.441
The truth is young, Billy boy.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.005
Yeah.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.565
Here, look.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.047
What have we got here? Oh, look.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.561
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

08:52.680 --> 08:54.250
Then there's some snow there, look.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.046
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.969
Now, I know you like that, hmm?

09:00.080 --> 09:01.320
Well, I do too.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.603
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have
a little line together?

09:04.720 --> 09:06.961

a little bit of snow together?

I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

09:15.840 --> 09:17.205
I do apologise.

- And working.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.320
about our family business...

09:41.400 --> 09:43.164
...and it's his life you're risking.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.930

Where is the mad bastard?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.480
He's tied to a lamp-post outside

an apology from Lizzie -
she can't be here.

in three weeks, with my blessing.

From now on, Aberama will be welcome
at our meetings.

Colonel Ben Younger,

11:49.120 --> 11:52.567
who may perhaps have become
a member of this family,

11:52.680 --> 11:54.205
was taken from us,

11:54.320 --> 11:56.402
four days ago,

11:56.520 --> 11:58.204
by dark forces.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.641
We've made some investigations,

12:00.760 --> 12:02.728
and we think we know
who planted the bomb.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.491
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

12:05.600 --> 12:08.365
and the baby inside of her,

12:08.480 --> 12:11.882
who may one day sit at these meetings,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.561
but hopefully
under happier circumstances.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.126
Let's drink to happier circumstances.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.605

12:21.040 --> 12:22.280
To Ada.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.802
- ALL: To Ada.
- Ada.

(COUGHS) Item number two.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.965
An announcement,

12:31.080 --> 12:32.161
regarding Michael.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.250
(CLEARS THROAT) Before you go on, Tommy,

12:35.360 --> 12:39.206
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

12:39.320 --> 12:42.324
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.920
According to your own estimations,

12:45.040 --> 12:48.726
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

12:48.840 --> 12:51.764
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.042
Therefore,

12:54.160 --> 12:56.561
due to the amounts involved,

12:56.680 --> 12:58.728
I think this company
should be restructured.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.640
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.966
Restructured in what way?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.048
GINA: Because of the amounts
of money involved,

13:06.160 --> 13:08.003
shipment and dispatch will become

13:08.120 --> 13:10.600
the primary source of income
to the company.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.246
It's simple mathematics.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.600
And with the help of my wife,

13:14.720 --> 13:17.564
I will organise an expansion into America,

13:17.680 --> 13:20.763
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.645
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,

13:23.760 --> 13:27.401
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.966
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.445
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

13:34.560 --> 13:35.925
with a regular supply

13:36.040 --> 13:37.724
of pure opium from China,

13:37.840 --> 13:40.127
within a short space of time,

13:40.240 --> 13:46.009
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

13:46.120 --> 13:52.162
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.202
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

13:58.320 --> 13:59.890
they're on the inside,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.525
not on the outside.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.847
And as a member of the new generation,

14:03.960 --> 14:07.760
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.408
A new decade is coming.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.603
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.324
More money than we've ever had before.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.684
Tommy,

14:19.800 --> 14:23.043
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.289
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.767
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.450
Fuck Linda.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.441
Finn.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.081
You've proved yourself.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.050
You're part of the new generation.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.928
You could come to New York with me.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.289
Here is my proposal.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.968
A full restructuring of the company.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.163
I will be managing director.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.442
And you can be nonexecutive chairman.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.564
But under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.210
I've found the name of a dead man.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.403
You will be registered as Mrjones.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.760
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

15:17.880 --> 15:23.444
and you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.201
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.450
At least read it with an open mind.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.006
It's cold in here, Michael.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.485
(LAUGHTER)

15:44.600 --> 15:46.841
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.325
Item number three.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.727
GINA: Tell him the truth.

15:50.840 --> 15:51.887
Go on.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.809
He can take it.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.722
Tell me the truth, Michael.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.365
The Americans don't want to deal with
an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.448
Those days are done.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.246
Tommy. He's bitten through
the fucking rope.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.566
They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.569
Go and get him!

16:24.680 --> 16:26.569
Fuck the Americans.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.441
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.530
It's time.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.446
And you know it.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.450
Tommy, Mum's leaving...

16:49.680 --> 16:52.889
...john's dead, Arthur needs help,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.561
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard
because you fucked up.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.762
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.369
Like the good old days.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.441
Or...

17:07.560 --> 17:09.847
...see this for what it is.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.244
A natural succession...

17:14.280 --> 17:15.964
...that someday must happen.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.119
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

17:25.359 --> 17:26.805
Don't be here when I get back.

17:26.920 --> 17:27.921
You. (CLICKS FINGERS)

17:29.320 --> 17:30.731
You can tell your family...

17:30.840 --> 17:32.808
Let me guess.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.570
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.131
Right?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.808
- Well...
- (DOOR CLOSES)

18:10.920 --> 18:13.127
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.928
They're not fucking voices!

18:20.040 --> 18:23.169
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.489
- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!

18:26.600 --> 18:28.011
Barney!

18:29.080 --> 18:30.241
Barney!

18:32.000 --> 18:34.367
Put down the gun. At ease.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.846
Finn.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.964
At ease, soldier. At ease.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.003
Look at me. You're on our side.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.043
You're at home.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.366
You're at home.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.721
Yeah? Yeah.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.684
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.643
Yeah.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.331
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.601
The devil will now be an angel.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.722
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.921
Come, brother.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.644
Let me give you the good news.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.046
Jesus loves you.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.485
So, where the fuck is he?

19:06.600 --> 19:07.681
THOMAS: All right, boys.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.761
A subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.082
ARTHUR: Right.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.725
Let's have the good stuff.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.002
None of that shit ponces' drink.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.088
Here we go, look.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.965
All right, so item number three.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.923
An introduction.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.170
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.123
In France, he was a comrade.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.571
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.126
He's a man we can use, johnny.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.971
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear
and take bets on the outcome?

19:53.080 --> 19:56.050
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.722
Aberama,

19:59.840 --> 20:03.765
that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.928
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

20:06.040 --> 20:09.283
which will make his actions explicable
to the police.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.209
What actions?

20:11.320 --> 20:12.765
A killing.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.042
ABERAMA: And since when
did you worry about the police?

20:18.560 --> 20:19.686
Barney Thomason...

20:21.080 --> 20:22.844
...is gonna kill an MP.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.804
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.241
What the fuck, Tom?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.524
(COUGHS)

20:33.640 --> 20:35.563
After the killing,

20:35.680 --> 20:38.206
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

20:38.320 --> 20:39.481
and Intelligence forces.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.404
There will be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.171
We need there to be no connection to us.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.567
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.081
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.043
He has known grievances.

20:55.160 --> 20:59.131
No-one will question
that the assassination was carried out

20:59.240 --> 21:01.607
by a single gunman acting alone.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.929
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.281
If they catch him,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.688
they won't hang him
on grounds of insanity,

21:10.800 --> 21:13.451
just send him back to where I found him.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.244
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

21:15.360 --> 21:17.727
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.808
And where will this killing take place?

21:24.680 --> 21:25.681
ARTHUR: There you go.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.361
He'll be on stage.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.642
With lots...

21:37.680 --> 21:39.011
...of witnesses.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.202
During the rally,

21:41.320 --> 21:44.005
there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.044
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.844
And we're organising this demonstration?

21:48.960 --> 21:50.086
Yeah.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.929
Where will you be, Tom?

21:55.280 --> 21:57.442
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

21:58.600 --> 22:00.011
...while the life drains from him.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.131
Then I'll make a speech...

22:04.320 --> 22:06.800
...saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

22:08.600 --> 22:10.090
...continue safe in my hands.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.446
ABERAMA: Holy fuck.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.125
Tommy...

22:16.520 --> 22:18.284
...does your ambition have no limits?

22:21.560 --> 22:24.404
Jimmy McCavern will be running security
at this event.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.170
He'll probably be in the wings.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.971
You can take his life
whichever manner you choose.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.963
What do you want us to do, Tom?

22:38.080 --> 22:40.082
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

22:40.200 --> 22:42.771
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.121
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.730
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.842
No. I will medicate him.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.442
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

22:52.560 --> 22:55.803
In France, he never missed...

22:56.840 --> 22:58.444
...no matter what they gave him.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.200
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.049
Before he takes the shot,

23:04.160 --> 23:08.210
Arthur here will give him some cocaine
to sharpen him up.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.924
So just...

23:10.040 --> 23:11.724
You're gonna be up on the stage

23:11.840 --> 23:14.969
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

23:15.080 --> 23:18.368
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

23:20.440 --> 23:22.363
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.802
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.925
After the killing,

23:30.040 --> 23:33.442
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.722
Use that opportunity

23:35.840 --> 23:39.162
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge locks.

23:39.280 --> 23:44.491
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.489
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.729
£250,000.

23:52.200 --> 23:56.364
Every man in this room
will receive $30,000 in cash,

23:56.480 --> 23:58.369
in recognition of extra services.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.802
Holy Mary, Mother of God, Tom!

24:01.920 --> 24:03.081
(LAUGHS)

24:03.200 --> 24:07.171
THOMAS: Anyone who wants to leave,
leave now.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.683
Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

24:11.800 --> 24:15.771
backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.521
Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.766
Good.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.647
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.842
Johnny, bring the van round.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.964
What's the fire for, Tom?

24:36.720 --> 24:38.722
There is an item number four.

24:38.840 --> 24:41.411
(LAUGHTER)

25:00.200 --> 25:01.361
It's time.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.489

25:28.440 --> 25:30.124
jeez, Mr Shelby.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.005
If I'd have known, I'd have come in early
and served you drinks, huh?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.645
Here, Micky.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.681
Sit down there.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.445
So I'll have a drink, will I?

26:07.640 --> 26:09.165
Here you go, have a drink.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.762
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.446
To collect some cargo.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.763
I was met by the Titanic boys.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.963
They knew I was coming.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.920
Yeah. When, where, what time.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.166
They even knew...

26:41.680 --> 26:42.761
...the cargo I was picking up.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.086
Jesus.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.123
Four days ago, Micky...

26:47.120 --> 26:48.531
...a soldier was killed...

26:49.560 --> 26:50.925
...outside my office...

26:52.200 --> 26:53.281
...by a bomb.

26:53.400 --> 26:57.041
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.321
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.250
No. It weren't the IRA.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.281
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.526
They're friends of mine.

27:15.520 --> 27:20.606
I asked them what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.006
They told me that...

27:26.200 --> 27:30.250
".30 minutes before the explosion
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill

27:30.360 --> 27:33.887
who has connections
to the Ulster Volunteer Force.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.367
He now offers his services for cash.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.289
Paddy Rose.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.641
Yeah, me and my brother,
we spoke to Paddy.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.081
At length.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.971
He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.327
Yeah, we spoke to him.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.009
We killed him, Micky.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.405
Paddy Rose is dead.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.648
We weighed him down,
