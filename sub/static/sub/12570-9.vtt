So, are you and your band

15:18.440 --> 15:20.334
ready to arm fart your way

15:16.542 --> 15:20.334
to last place?

15:20.375 --> 15:21.667
(LAUGHING)

15:22.876 --> 15:24.168
You know what?

15:24.169 --> 15:25.459
It doesn't matter

15:22.876 --> 15:25.459
where we place.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.313
The point is, we're going

15:27.314 --> 15:29.125
to go up there,

15:25.500 --> 15:29.125
arm fart our hearts out,

15:29.167 --> 15:30.250
and didgeridoo our best!

15:30.292 --> 15:31.772
- We're going home
- with that trophy.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.709
You don't scare me.

15:33.751 --> 15:34.793
Although your jacket

15:34.794 --> 15:35.834
does make me

15:33.751 --> 15:35.834
a little nauseous.

15:40.375 --> 15:41.959
- So, here's
- what I'm thinking.

15:42.292 --> 15:44.250
You. Me. Date.

15:45.334 --> 15:46.500
You're welcome.

15:47.292 --> 15:48.542
Why, you low down,

15:48.543 --> 15:49.792
dirty varmint!

15:49.834 --> 15:51.293
Whoa, what's

15:51.294 --> 15:52.751
with the weird accent,

15:49.834 --> 15:52.751
Honey Boo Boo?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.959
Emmy is my friend.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.042
And you are a pig!

15:57.083 --> 15:58.459
You know what we do

15:58.460 --> 15:59.834
with pigs in my neck

15:57.083 --> 15:59.834
of the woods?

16:00.375 --> 16:01.876
Kiss them?

16:02.375 --> 16:04.000
In your dreams, city boy!

16:08.209 --> 16:09.626
And... Time!

16:12.083 --> 16:13.292
Maybelle?

16:14.209 --> 16:15.334
What did you do?

16:16.417 --> 16:17.560
- I was just telling her about
- how much I like you,

16:17.584 --> 16:18.792
And the next thing

16:18.793 --> 16:20.000
I know she attacks me.

16:20.334 --> 16:22.167
- How could you hog-tie
- my soul mate?

16:22.209 --> 16:23.334
Emmy, I can explain.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.136
- I cannot believe
- you're friends with her!

16:25.250 --> 16:26.250
I'm not.

16:27.751 --> 16:28.835
I only invited her

16:28.836 --> 16:29.918
because my nanny

16:27.751 --> 16:29.918
told me I had to.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
- Oh, but...
- I thought we were friends.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.375
I mean, you were so sweet,

16:35.417 --> 16:37.778
- wanting me to be - comfortable
at your party, - And all...

16:39.083 --> 16:41.334
Oh, I see.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.710
The makeover

16:42.711 --> 16:43.751
wasn't for me,

16:41.667 --> 16:43.751
it was for you.

16:45.626 --> 16:46.897
Well, sorry I'm such

16:46.898 --> 16:48.167
an embarrassment.

16:52.292 --> 16:53.314
What is going on

16:53.315 --> 16:54.334
out here?

16:55.083 --> 16:57.000
- None of you are
- using coasters!

17:02.584 --> 17:04.188
Guys, great news!

17:04.189 --> 17:05.791
The FBI found

17:02.584 --> 17:05.791
your instruments!

17:05.834 --> 17:07.231
Huzzah! Although,

17:07.232 --> 17:08.626
I would not think

17:05.834 --> 17:08.626
such petty theft

17:08.666 --> 17:10.084
is worthy of

17:10.085 --> 17:11.500
the Federal Bureau

17:08.666 --> 17:11.500
of Investigation.

17:11.541 --> 17:13.375
It's not. Uh...

17:13.416 --> 17:14.917
These were found by the...

17:16.334 --> 17:18.709
Formal Band Investigators.

17:18.751 --> 17:21.071
- Now, don't think too - much about it,
- And go get ready!

17:23.334 --> 17:24.917
- Luke.
- Shh!

17:25.416 --> 17:26.730
Luke, you play

17:26.731 --> 17:28.041
the accordion because

17:25.416 --> 17:28.041
you love it, right?

17:28.083 --> 17:30.042
- Sure. It combines my two
- favorite things,

17:30.083 --> 17:31.272
Making noise and

17:31.273 --> 17:32.459
violently squeezing stuff.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.792
And you're pretty

17:35.793 --> 17:37.500
amazing at it.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.500
You should be proud of that.

17:38.334 --> 17:40.083
- You really think so?
- I do.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.439
So my advice is to

17:42.440 --> 17:44.751
take off your disguise

17:40.125 --> 17:44.751
and let your freak flag fly!

17:46.000 --> 17:47.292
- You know what?
- Hmm.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.250
I think you're right.

17:49.292 --> 17:50.896
It's time I stopped

17:50.897 --> 17:52.500
hiding behind Chip Falcon

17:49.292 --> 17:52.500
and embrace who I really am,

17:52.542 --> 17:54.500
master of the chest piano!

17:56.083 --> 17:57.844
- Maybe you shouldn't
- let it fly that high.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.334
- Attention,
- fellow band rejects.

18:03.626 --> 18:06.189
It is I, Luke Ross!

18:06.190 --> 18:08.751
(GRUNTING)

18:03.626 --> 18:08.751
And I am one of you!

18:11.375 --> 18:13.000
- Luke, everyone knew
- it was you.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.876
What? How?

18:15.918 --> 18:17.459
Your accordion case says,

18:17.460 --> 18:19.000
"Property of Luke Ross."

18:19.792 --> 18:21.709
Aw, man!

18:21.751 --> 18:23.376
I can't believe I glued

18:23.377 --> 18:25.000
all this chest hair

18:21.751 --> 18:25.000
to myself for nothing!

18:26.792 --> 18:28.772
You're up! And I predict

18:28.773 --> 18:30.751
that you and your

18:26.792 --> 18:30.751
little band of weirdos

18:30.792 --> 18:32.105
is going to be the biggest

18:32.106 --> 18:33.417
disaster since I got stuck

18:30.792 --> 18:33.417
in a sousaphone.

18:34.626 --> 18:36.000
It's a long story.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.085
This is your chance

18:44.086 --> 18:45.459
to show Mr. Collinsworth

18:42.709 --> 18:45.459
that he was wrong about you.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.042
- So, after the opening
- I want you to take a solo,

18:48.083 --> 18:49.772
And blow out those tacky

18:49.773 --> 18:51.459
flames on his jacket.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.459
Okay?

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
- Got it.
- Okay.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.584
Okay, guys...

18:55.626 --> 18:56.626
This is your moment,

18:56.627 --> 18:57.627

but I pass.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.501
I would rather stick

20:08.502 --> 20:09.918
with the band,

20:07.083 --> 20:09.918
and the band leader,

20:09.959 --> 20:11.959

20:22.083 --> 20:23.542
They do not hand these out

20:23.543 --> 20:25.000
just for showing up, you know.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.083
Actually, they do.

Emma, how was your party?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.292
Horrible. Maybelle

20:34.293 --> 20:35.500
hog-tied my boyfriend!

- Jessie.

Oh! Try anywhere.

20:48.439 --> 20:49.792
It's empty.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.000
I just talked to Maybelle.

20:54.584 --> 20:55.814
Emma, you should

20:55.815 --> 20:57.042
feel horrible for how

20:54.584 --> 20:57.042
you treated her!

20:57.083 --> 20:58.709
Me? Give me one good reason

20:58.710 --> 21:00.334
I should feel horrible.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.709
Rick wanted to go

21:01.710 --> 21:03.042
out with Maybelle too,

21:03.083 --> 21:05.042
and because she was

21:05.043 --> 21:07.000
such a loyal friend to you,

21:03.083 --> 21:07.000
she roped the dope.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.810
- Okay, I know I'm - coming to this
- Thing late,

21:09.834 --> 21:10.939
But that sounds like

21:10.940 --> 21:12.042
a pretty good reason to me.

21:12.876 --> 21:13.960
I can't believe

21:13.961 --> 21:15.042
Rick would be such a jerk.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.126
I mean, what kind of guy

21:16.127 --> 21:17.167
does that?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.334
Have you not listened

21:19.335 --> 21:21.000
to any of my

21:17.667 --> 21:21.000
boyfriend stories?

21:21.709 --> 21:23.105
The consistent moral

21:23.106 --> 21:24.500
is that guys can be jerks!

21:26.000 --> 21:27.063
I never should have

21:27.064 --> 21:28.125
tried to change Maybelle.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.250
Probably not.

21:31.292 --> 21:32.688
If I learned one thing today,

21:32.689 --> 21:34.083
it's that you have to let

21:31.292 --> 21:34.083
people be who they are,

21:34.125 --> 21:35.376
even if they're loud,

21:35.377 --> 21:36.626
embarrassing

21:36.667 --> 21:37.793
and cause irreparable

21:37.794 --> 21:38.918
hearing damage.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.792
- Well, what am I supposed
- to do now?

21:41.834 --> 21:42.939
I'm sure Maybelle

21:42.940 --> 21:44.042
never wants to talk

21:41.834 --> 21:44.042
to me again.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.209
Then you do the talking.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.585
And by talking,

21:46.586 --> 21:47.918
I mean apologizing.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.459
And you better

21:49.460 --> 21:50.959
do it quick, in case her

21:47.959 --> 21:50.959
memaw is the feudin' type.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.125
Hey, Maybelle.

21:56.709 --> 21:57.792
Can we talk?

21:58.167 --> 21:59.292
Nope!

21:59.334 --> 22:01.334
Okay, I deserve that.

22:01.918 --> 22:03.376
You know, Emma,

22:03.377 --> 22:04.834
I tried to change because

22:01.918 --> 22:04.834
I wanted you to like me.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.834
- Well, you shouldn't
- have to change.

22:06.876 --> 22:08.022
It was awesome of you

22:08.023 --> 22:09.167
to stand up for me

22:06.876 --> 22:09.167
like that.

22:09.209 --> 22:11.167
- And I like you just
- the way you are.

22:11.209 --> 22:12.272
Well, you sure have a

22:12.273 --> 22:13.334
funny way of showin' it.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.709
Just because

22:14.710 --> 22:16.042
I don't know fancy things

22:16.083 --> 22:17.918
like which fork to use,

22:17.919 --> 22:19.751
or how to walk

22:16.083 --> 22:19.751
in them pointy shoes,

22:19.792 --> 22:21.292
or what deodorant is...

22:22.792 --> 22:23.918
You're right, Maybelle.

22:23.919 --> 22:25.042
I've been a horrible friend,

22:25.834 --> 22:27.167
and I'm really sorry.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.042
If anyone needs

22:29.043 --> 22:30.043
to change, it's me.

22:33.959 --> 22:35.480
Oh-wee!

22:35.481 --> 22:37.000
You look like

22:33.959 --> 22:37.000

22:42.292 --> 22:43.668
Yep! I gussied them

22:43.669 --> 22:45.042
up a little bit.

22:45.083 --> 22:46.583
And I told Rick to

22:46.584 --> 22:48.083
take a long walk

22:45.083 --> 22:48.083
off a short pier.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.667

23:06.959 --> 23:08.959
Whoa. Baby steps.

23:13.876 --> 23:15.106
No, we've been over this.

23:15.107 --> 23:16.334
This part is staccato.

23:13.876 --> 23:16.334
Keep up.

23:17.042 --> 23:18.125
(GROWLING)

23:18.167 --> 23:19.918
- Uh, Jessie?
- Hmm?

23:19.959 --> 23:20.980
Shouldn't we wait until

23:20.981 --> 23:22.000
more people show up?

23:22.042 --> 23:23.481
Yeah, I thought you said

23:23.482 --> 23:24.918
there'd be a packed house

23:22.042 --> 23:24.918
full of rabid fans.

23:24.959 --> 23:25.980
Well, hopefully

23:25.981 --> 23:27.000
they're not rabid.

23:24.959 --> 23:27.000
Just eager.

23:27.751 --> 23:29.271
- It's sitting
- and staying room only!

23:32.792 --> 23:34.000
(LAUGHING)

23:34.083 --> 23:35.918
What are you doing here?

23:35.959 --> 23:37.605
Okay, look the truth is,

23:37.606 --> 23:39.250
I want to be in your band!

23:40.125 --> 23:41.417
I can play my cheeks!

23:41.459 --> 23:42.771
This is a public park!

23:42.772 --> 23:44.083
And there are

23:41.459 --> 23:44.083
children present!

23:44.876 --> 23:46.043
No, no, no!

23:46.044 --> 23:47.209
My upstairs cheeks.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.000
Here. (CLEARS THROAT)

23:49.042 --> 23:50.334
(HUMMING)

23:52.167 --> 23:54.000
- You're just humming.
- Am not.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.083
Okay.

23:57.626 --> 23:58.813
Your parents are paying

23:58.814 --> 24:00.000
way too much money

23:57.626 --> 24:00.000
for that school.
