00:14.660 --> 00:19.310
I wrote that! I'm Liz Lemon.

00:22.300 --> 00:27.600
"If your man is over 30, and still wears a
nametag to work, that's a dealbreaker."

00:27.635 --> 00:29.987
But not you, Mike.

00:30.022 --> 00:32.305
That's not you.

00:32.340 --> 00:36.140
Mike, leave my cutout alone.

00:37.450 --> 00:40.230
Okay, you know, I'm gonna do the same thing to your cutout.

00:40.265 --> 00:43.850
Oh, wait, you don't have one, because you're nobody.

00:45.490 --> 00:50.850
Blam-o! Another successful interaction with a man!

01:11.350 --> 01:13.495
Yes, mr. Geiss, of course.

01:13.530 --> 01:16.140
Well, I'll only be in DC for the day, but if I find time,

01:16.175 --> 01:19.300
I'll be sure to go see Fonzie's jacket.

01:19.335 --> 01:21.975
You sit on it as well.

01:22.010 --> 01:26.130
Hey, if you're going to DC, I lost my retainer
there during a junior high field trip.

01:26.165 --> 01:27.675
What can I do for you, Lemon?

01:27.710 --> 01:32.090
Well, I wanted to give you a copy of my book.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.155
They used your blurb.

01:34.190 --> 01:37.255
"Lemon numbers among my employees. "

01:37.290 --> 01:40.140
Sir, your bus to Washington leaves in half an hour.

01:40.175 --> 01:42.465
- You're taking a bus?
- I have to.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.070
Ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes,

01:45.105 --> 01:46.775
the rest of us have to put on a show.

01:46.810 --> 01:50.650
And now, your president - who, by the way,
is Kenyan and smokes cigarettes - 

01:50.685 --> 01:54.490
has created an industry task force for microwaves and small appliances.

01:54.525 --> 01:57.330
Why? Do you need to be bailed out with my tax dollars?

01:57.365 --> 01:59.600
Even if they wanted to, I wouldn't take it.

01:59.635 --> 02:01.325
It's corporate welfare, Lemon.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.155
Granted, the microwave industry isn't what it used to be,

02:04.190 --> 02:09.300
and the American love affair with the microwave oven
has cooled since its postwar heyday.

02:09.335 --> 02:14.320
* and she told her daddy she was doin' the microwave *

02:14.355 --> 02:18.130
* do the microwave *

02:18.730 --> 02:20.195
Did that happen?

02:20.230 --> 02:23.765
But, unlike Detroit, we don't need handouts or regulation.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.300
I'm gonna go down there, talk circles around these hacks,

02:27.335 --> 02:29.305
and catch the afternoon bus back to Chinatown.

02:29.340 --> 02:33.295
Now, where was the last place you remember having your retainer?

02:33.330 --> 02:36.810
I took it out to eat astronaut ice cream at the Air and Space Museum.

02:36.845 --> 02:40.325
Air and Space...

02:40.360 --> 02:43.440
If your man collects action figures, that's a dealbreaker?

02:43.475 --> 02:45.055
What? Oh, yeah.

02:45.090 --> 02:48.110
Last weekend, I picked up this girl after
practicing Jedi moves in Prospect Park.

02:48.145 --> 02:51.130
- Also a dealbreaker.
- I took her back to my house on the handlebars of my bike,

02:51.165 --> 02:53.405
- As is that.
- snuck her inside, past my mom.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.380
- Wow, that's four.
- She sees my mint-condition Hellboy figurine and starts quoting your dumb book!

02:58.415 --> 03:00.910
Also, my girlfriend is mad.

03:00.945 --> 03:03.310
In Canada.

03:04.830 --> 03:08.380
Ms. Lemon, would it be all right if I only worked 20 hours today?

03:08.415 --> 03:10.595
I'm volunteering at an animal shelter later on.

03:10.630 --> 03:12.485
Oh, of course. I didn't know you did volunteer work.

03:12.520 --> 03:16.985
Oh, yes. I also help out at the Pants For Zoo animals program and Big Brother.

03:17.020 --> 03:21.510
Really? I did Big Sister in college. That little girl taught me how to use tampons.

03:21.545 --> 03:24.795
Oh, no, this Big Brother isn't affiliated with the mentoring program.

03:24.830 --> 03:29.960
It's an organization that secretly watches people and
makes sure they're behaving properly.

03:34.690 --> 03:38.145
Liz, I don't if you saw the crawl on the tv guide channel,

03:38.180 --> 03:42.790
but I've agreed to star in a sexy, supernatural thriller
in the vein of Twilight and True Blood.

03:42.825 --> 03:45.065
Oh, that's good. The vampire movies are hot right now.

03:45.100 --> 03:49.240
This is actually a werewolf picture that, for tax reasons, is shooting in Iceland.

03:49.275 --> 03:52.580
I play a moon scientist who's trying to get to the bottom of things,

03:52.615 --> 03:56.850
And who-spoiler alert-may herself be a werewolf.

03:56.885 --> 04:00.415
We start shooting tonight.

04:00.450 --> 04:02.825
You can't leave. You have rehearsal tomorrow.

04:02.860 --> 04:07.310
Oh, well, why don't you get the new cast member to cover for me?

04:07.345 --> 04:08.745
Okay.

04:08.780 --> 04:12.680
Look, I know that you're mad about Jack's decision to bring in another actor,

04:12.715 --> 04:14.462
and you want to punish me.

04:14.497 --> 04:16.175
Punish you? Please, Liz.

04:16.209 --> 04:19.589
I've just always wanted to shoot a student werewolf movie in Iceland,

04:19.625 --> 04:21.877
where I'm filling in last-minute for Victoria Beckham.

04:21.911 --> 04:24.095
Or we could sit down and talk about this like adults.

04:24.130 --> 04:29.635
Liz Lemon! You booger face! I'm gonna kill you with a bazooka!

04:29.670 --> 04:33.860
I bought my wife that dumb book of yours, and the more
Angie reads it, the madder she gets at me.

04:33.895 --> 04:35.180
Well, maybe that's on you, Tray.

04:35.215 --> 04:36.695
No, it's off me!

04:36.730 --> 04:41.950
A book hasn't caused me this much trouble since where's waldo went to that barber pole factory.

04:41.985 --> 04:44.467
It's on you Liz Lemon.

04:44.502 --> 04:46.950
And you will be punished.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.655
This'll take ten minutes.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.500
Let's hit the Meadowlands racetrack on the way home.

04:55.535 --> 04:58.310
I've got a betting system based on horse penis size.

05:05.890 --> 05:12.010
Is it true, mr. Donaghy, that your executives routinely used company helicopters to dry their home tennis courts?

05:12.045 --> 05:15.305
Yes, and no. Yes, that did happen. No, it didn't not happen.

05:15.340 --> 05:18.580
And that GE kept a party clown on retainer with a six-figure salary?

05:18.615 --> 05:21.472
When Silly Willy's fee was amortized over all birthdays companywide-

05:21.507 --> 05:24.330
I'm being told that company money is being gambled at racetracks.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.435
Yes, but I have a system.

05:25.470 --> 05:32.180
In 2007, a GE officer used corporate funds to throw a cabaret-themed halloween party on Fire Island.

05:32.215 --> 05:33.365
As I recall, that was you.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.505
Mr. Donaghy, I am overwhelmed by the negligence and incompetence.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.700
It is an affront to your shareholders and, frankly, to the American people.

05:40.735 --> 05:42.405
Listen, Banks!

05:42.440 --> 05:46.405
Mr. Banks, you go and tell your president the truth.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.510
We don't need the government telling us how to run our industry.

05:48.545 --> 05:50.115
I've heard enough.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.050
Why do you have a gavel? This isn't the Congress.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.500
I brought it from home.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.785
Congratulations, Liz Lemon.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.685
Now Angie wants a break.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.405
So instead of going to a hotel, or my houseboat, which I cannot find,

06:07.440 --> 06:11.090
I'm staying with the woman that started this problem in the first place.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.385
What? No. Tracy, that is not fair.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.600
Oh, yeah, there's a garbage bag in the hallway with a reef shark in it.

06:16.635 --> 06:18.735
Just put him in the tub with a reef.

06:18.770 --> 06:22.900
What's for dinner tonight? I want pierogies!

06:25.410 --> 06:29.580
Unfortunately, we're not gonna be able to find homes for all these animals.

06:29.615 --> 06:32.167
But, uh, you know, the most important thing is that

06:32.202 --> 06:34.986
you not become emotionally attached to any of them.

06:35.021 --> 06:37.735
I grew up on a pig farm, sir, where all the animals,

06:37.770 --> 06:41.995
even the birds that cleaned our teeth, were workers, not pets.

06:42.030 --> 06:47.060
I never even had a dog, 'cause, as my mom would say, you can't eat love.

06:47.095 --> 06:50.000
And as my mom's friend Ron would say, "The donkey died.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.760
You're the donkey now, Kenneth. "

06:52.795 --> 06:54.732
Just another animal.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.635
Might as well be a rat.

06:56.670 --> 07:01.790
An adorable rat, who shows you it's okay to be scared during a thunderstorm.

07:01.825 --> 07:05.930
Why, it seems crazy to me to even give a dog like this a name.

07:05.965 --> 07:07.665
For example, Bandit.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.925
And that's Reggie, and up there is Digger,

07:10.960 --> 07:14.630
Well, the dogs scheduled to be put down today have red tags on them.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.565
I will adopt all of them.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.160
Jonathan, call Don Geiss' office and Les Winkler in Corporate Communications.

07:20.195 --> 07:23.345
Tell Susan Cunningham, Alan Junkin, Mark-Jack.

07:23.380 --> 07:26.865
- What took you so long?
- Banks, you son of a bitch.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.350
You know, revenge is a dish best served cold, Jack.

07:30.385 --> 07:32.367
Like... Sashimi. Or pizza.

07:32.402 --> 07:34.315
You prefer cold pizza?

07:34.350 --> 07:36.005
The morning after, it's the best.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.625
Better than hot pizza? That's insane.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.495
You don't tell me what kind of pizza to like.

07:40.530 --> 07:43.330
You don't tell me anything anymore, Jack!

07:44.160 --> 07:47.170
It was a year ago that you kicked me to the curb.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.075
I began plotting my revenge that very day.

07:49.110 --> 07:52.355
I knew that I had to align myself with something more powerful than GE,

07:52.390 --> 07:57.195
and since American Idol is not on till January, that left the United States government.

07:57.230 --> 08:02.000
So I spent all last fall raising money, worming my way into the Obamas' inner circle.

08:02.035 --> 08:04.140
Oh, my god, Malia, he did not say that!

08:04.175 --> 08:06.045
Let's text him now.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.010
After the election, I could have had any ambassadorship I wanted.

08:10.045 --> 08:13.195
Even to the world's gayest country, Ireland.

08:13.230 --> 08:16.490
Instead, I suggested that I take on this task force.

08:16.525 --> 08:20.010
See, I had you in my sights the whole time.

08:20.045 --> 08:21.485
What kind of gun was that?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.780
It's a laser gun. It's unstoppable.

08:23.815 --> 08:25.275
You listen to me, Banks.

08:25.310 --> 08:28.230
You keep your spray-tanned little hands off this company.

08:28.265 --> 08:29.175
Too late.

08:29.210 --> 08:33.120
Your testimony's gonna make headlines in every paper across the country tomorrow.

08:33.155 --> 08:36.220
But... it wasn't a public hearing.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.309
Somebody must have "weaked" it.

08:38.345 --> 08:39.917
You did. You "weaked" it!

08:39.952 --> 08:41.455
And I'm just getting started.

08:41.490 --> 08:45.600
By the time I'm done, you're gonna make AIG look like the Lehman Brothers of microwaves.

08:45.635 --> 08:48.715
You would destroy an entire company just to get me?

08:48.750 --> 08:53.050
Think of the pensions, the employees, the kittens we use to test microwave strength.

08:53.085 --> 08:54.655
Enjoy the view while you can, Jack.

08:54.690 --> 08:57.095
You'll be here for about three days, tops.

08:57.130 --> 08:59.465
Oh, that's all I'll need, Banks, you watch me.

08:59.500 --> 09:05.710
I'll make this company profitable so fast, the only headline will be, "Donaghy saves GE, marries your mom. "

09:05.745 --> 09:08.440
See you in a couple days, Jack.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.640
Laser shield.

09:22.970 --> 09:25.460
Tracy and Liz's residence. Tracy speaking.

09:25.495 --> 09:27.370
Tracy, it's Jenna. Is Liz there?

09:27.405 --> 09:29.785
It's Jenna, from work.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.895
Jenna, it's 2:00 in the morning. What's going on?

09:31.930 --> 09:36.850
Night Stalkers has encountered some production speed bumps that are complicating my schedule.

09:36.885 --> 09:39.742
Well, I need you back by Friday. What kind of speed bumps?

09:39.777 --> 09:42.600
Well, Iceland appears to have a different sun than America,

09:42.635 --> 09:44.465
Because this one is not setting.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.725
Ugh, yeah, of course, 'cause it's so far north.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.150
And you probably don't know this, because you've never played a moonologist,

09:50.185 --> 09:52.145
but werewolves only come out at night.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.560
Yes, I remember that from the Thriller video.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.945
Too soon.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.605
What is your plan, Jenna?

09:57.640 --> 10:01.500
Well, evidently, as it gets later in the year the sun will start to set.

10:01.535 --> 10:04.445
I'm told tomorrow night we may get as much as a minute of darkness.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.470
Really? So you're gonna shoot this movie one minute at a time, just to punish me?

10:08.505 --> 10:10.370
Liz, I don't even know what you're talking about.

10:10.405 --> 10:11.850
What new cast member? Bye~

10:11.885 --> 10:15.110
No, you...

10:15.720 --> 10:17.075
What's wrong, roomie?

10:17.110 --> 10:21.930
Well, two of my coworkers are driving me insane, so I'm gonna kill them in their sleep tonight.

10:32.570 --> 10:36.560
- Tracy and Liz's. Tracy speaking.
- Tracy, put Lemon on.

10:36.595 --> 10:37.735
Hello?

10:37.770 --> 10:41.790
Okay, as a single woman, would you be more inclined to buy a new microwave

10:41.825 --> 10:44.500
if it could be programmed to ask you about your day?

10:44.535 --> 10:46.970
Before you answer, consider your loneliness.

10:47.005 --> 10:49.980
I'm hanging up now.

10:52.290 --> 10:56.390
Now that we're all up, you want to talk about the elephant in the room?

10:56.425 --> 11:00.100
No, I don't. I don't even know why you brought that thing.

11:00.135 --> 11:01.892
I mean the figurative elephant!

11:01.927 --> 11:04.078
Liz, I been reading your book.

11:04.113 --> 11:06.195
Now I see why Angie's mad at me.

11:06.230 --> 11:10.060
"If your man has seven cell phones, but won't give you any of the numbers,

11:10.095 --> 11:11.545
that's a dealbreaker"?

11:11.580 --> 11:15.720
"If your man owns a diamond necklace that says open marriage,

11:15.755 --> 11:17.575
that's a dealbreaker"!

11:17.610 --> 11:20.660
Liz Lemon, every little thing I've done is in here.

11:20.695 --> 11:22.525
You used me to write your book!

11:22.560 --> 11:25.280
What? No, maybe some of it is inspired by you.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.215
You stole my life.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.145
- And you're gonna pay for it.
- Really?

11:29.180 --> 11:33.650
You're gonna make my life worse than it is right now, how?

11:34.120 --> 11:36.675
[barking]

11:36.710 --> 11:39.060
I'll take all of them.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.875
Tracy and Jenna are like children.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.450
And like children, you can't reason with them when they're upset.

11:44.485 --> 11:46.990
All you can do is turn the heat up, pour some whisky in their juice,

11:47.025 --> 11:48.485
and wait for sleep to save you.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.110
Well, that's not gonna work for me, because Jenna is immune to whisky,

11:51.145 --> 11:53.145
and Tracy is afraid of juice.

11:53.180 --> 11:57.670
Oh, and not to add to your problems, but Paula read your book.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.540
Attention, creative types. Brainstorming session.

12:01.575 --> 12:04.660
Let's try to stop mouth-breathing for one minute.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.835
What is this?

12:06.870 --> 12:11.220
It's an idea. An idea that started this company, changed the way we live,

12:11.255 --> 12:14.257
and made this country great. This is Dinesh Mehta.

12:14.292 --> 12:17.225
He's a design engineer from the microwave division.

12:17.260 --> 12:22.040
All Dinesh and I need from you is one idea that is as good as the light bulb.

12:22.075 --> 12:22.995
What?

12:23.030 --> 12:26.705
I have two days to make people buy a lot of microwaves.

12:26.740 --> 12:30.290
Well, it's kind of annoying when you're microwaving, like, a burrito,

12:30.325 --> 12:32.785
and the burrito won't rotate because it's too big.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.950
It just gets caught against the sides and the tray under it rotates,

12:36.985 --> 12:40.370
but it doesn't rotate.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.425
Bigger ovens. Americans like big, yes. What else?

12:43.460 --> 12:48.760
What if microwaves broke down more easily, so people would have to buy new ones more often?

12:48.795 --> 12:50.582
Yes, shoddier, excellent.

12:50.617 --> 12:52.335
Bigger and not as well-made.

12:52.370 --> 12:56.950
Wow, that sounds exactly like the philosophy that almost destroyed the US auto industry.

12:56.985 --> 13:01.530
This isn't the auto industry, Pete. The auto industry was run by a bunch of out-of-touch

13:01.565 --> 13:04.670
white guys selling consumers a product they didn't want.

13:04.705 --> 13:06.025
We're GE, damn it.

13:06.060 --> 13:10.480
And we're gonna make a giant, flimsy microwave.

13:16.650 --> 13:19.950
Frank, I can't! If I make it any bigger, the door will be too heavy.

13:19.985 --> 13:23.550
Fine! Forget it.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.850
Wait.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.015
Say that again.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.790
I said forget it.

13:29.825 --> 13:32.222
Four... get it.

13:32.257 --> 13:34.585
Four smaller doors.

13:34.620 --> 13:38.050
- Yes! We'll crack this yet.
- "We'll" crack this yet.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.120
Wheel. Put wheels on it.

13:41.155 --> 13:44.325
- Nice.
- Donaghy!

13:44.360 --> 13:46.035
Okay, it's go time. Are you ready?

13:46.070 --> 13:47.675
I'm in character and everything.

13:47.710 --> 13:50.840
All right, let's do this! The sun is setting! We get one shot at this!

13:50.875 --> 13:52.890
Thank you.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.715
And action!

13:56.750 --> 14:00.550
Claire, I'm sorry. Which hand did I have the flashlight in when we were inside?

14:00.585 --> 14:02.890
The right! You had it in the right.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.560
Thank you.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.895
Cut!

14:07.930 --> 14:09.945
Great day, everyone.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.690
You guys are the real stars.

14:22.710 --> 14:26.980
Since I have neither the time nor the energy to even pretend that your situation is a real problem-

14:27.015 --> 14:30.527
- She doesn't like to refill the-
- I will cut the baby in half.

14:30.562 --> 14:34.040
And I will take the top half. For that is the part with the face.

14:34.075 --> 14:36.952
Lemon, you wrote about Tracy's life for your own game.

14:36.987 --> 14:39.795
Tracy should be allowed to use your life as he sees fit.

14:39.830 --> 14:43.260
I'll have Jonathan call legal and get a life rights contract drawn up.

14:43.295 --> 14:46.910
Wait, what do you mean? Tracy will own my life story?

14:46.945 --> 14:48.910
What are you gonna do with my life story?

14:48.945 --> 14:52.110
Something humiliating.

14:52.370 --> 14:54.675
Thank you, Jack.

14:54.710 --> 14:56.620
- Thanks a lot, Jack.
- It's your only move, Lemon.

14:56.655 --> 14:59.272
Sometimes the way back up down.

14:59.307 --> 15:01.855
Let me tell you a story. It's 1994.

15:01.890 --> 15:04.510
I went ice climbing, and I fell into a crevasse.

15:04.545 --> 15:07.095
I hurt my leg, and I couldn't climb back up.

15:07.130 --> 15:11.280
So fighting every natural instinct, doing the thing that seemed most awful to me,

15:11.315 --> 15:14.050
I climbed down into the darkness.

15:14.085 --> 15:15.495
And that's how I got out.

15:15.530 --> 15:18.595
And when I got back to base camp, I went and found my fellow climber,

15:18.630 --> 15:25.010
the one who had cut me loose after I fell, and I said, "Connie Chung, you did the right thing.

15:25.045 --> 15:28.130
- Thank you.
- Climb down, Lemon.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.370
Climb down.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.685
Hey, you're back.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.820
Yes, Night Stalkers is taking a brief, permanent hiatus.

15:36.855 --> 15:38.965
Well, maybe now we can talk.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.100
Jenna, I'm your friend, no matter what, and I will always-

15:42.135 --> 15:44.570
Oh, Liz, I would really love to do this.

15:44.605 --> 15:46.285
But I have to go home for the day.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.800
Gotcha. So you're sticking with the passive-aggressive acting out.

15:49.835 --> 15:51.665
No! It's not acting out.

15:51.700 --> 15:56.910
I have mercury poisoning, from obsessively taking my rectal temperature.

15:58.980 --> 16:02.205
And cup holders. Everyone loves cup holders.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.105
Okay, I've been up for the last 50 hours, but I think this is a good idea.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.970
Let's get rid of the oven entirely and replace it with an AM/FM radio.

16:12.680 --> 16:18.370
Okay, it's a car. We've invented the pontiac aztec.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.530
Thank you, Subhas.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.860
You are the dealbreaker!

16:33.990 --> 16:36.400
This is a bill.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.615
Tracy.

16:42.650 --> 16:46.310
Hey, roomie. Did you order pay-per-view at my apartment?

16:46.345 --> 16:47.825
I'm willing to go splitsies.

16:47.860 --> 16:52.580
I'm not paying for any of this. You ordered six adult movies in two days.

16:52.615 --> 16:56.100
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Butt. " Lovely.

16:56.135 --> 16:58.370
"I'ma Do Us"? What does that even mean?

16:58.405 --> 17:00.702
That's a pun on Amadeus, dummy.

17:00.737 --> 17:02.703
I will not be judged by you.

17:02.738 --> 17:04.635
You caused this whole folderol.

17:04.670 --> 17:09.964
Until you're adequately debased, you will subsidize my predilection for erotica.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.329
Oh, yeah, and I used your credit card to buy a vocabulary course from the teaching company.

17:14.365 --> 17:16.920
So you're saying once you figure out how to get back at me,

17:16.954 --> 17:19.589
you and the dogs will leave my apartment?

17:19.625 --> 17:21.385
Affirmative.

17:21.420 --> 17:25.520
I have to climb down... into the darkness.

17:25.555 --> 17:29.585
I know what you should do with my life rights.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.765
Pete, keep tours out of the studio for the next couple days.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.890
I need you to build a set that looks like my apartment and get all the hand sanitizer you can find.

17:36.925 --> 17:40.880
- Wait, wait, why do you need-
- Tracy is producing a porno based on my life.

17:40.915 --> 17:43.310
And I'm writing it.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.540
I didn't think it would end like this, Jonathan.

17:47.575 --> 17:50.060
Not with a bang, but with a whimper.

17:50.095 --> 17:53.425
A whimper indeed, Jack.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.965
I only came by to wish you luck on your new venture.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.265
What do you think that'll be? Selling fake weed to NYU students?

17:59.300 --> 18:03.820
I'll have you know that Barry Diller and I are working on a whole new approach to media,

18:03.855 --> 18:07.305
combining all the digital... God!

18:07.340 --> 18:09.865
- Just let me drink.
- See you around, Jack.

18:09.900 --> 18:14.570
Thanks for letting me be such a big part of you hitting rock bottom, huh?

18:14.605 --> 18:17.047
Not yet, Banks.

18:17.082 --> 18:19.886
I can go lower.

18:19.921 --> 18:22.690
Into the crevasse.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.705
- What?
- You played this all wrong.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.470
You want to humiliate me? You want to destroy me?

18:27.505 --> 18:29.760
You should have walked in here with a check.

18:29.795 --> 18:30.695
Again, what?

18:30.730 --> 18:34.315
Sure, maybe you've ruined my career. Maybe you'll never see me again.

18:34.350 --> 18:41.380
But if you had forced me to take government bailout money, you'd be my boss.

18:41.415 --> 18:43.890
Oh, my.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.025
You'd have to come down to Washington.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.530
Report to me, like a little school boy...

18:49.565 --> 18:51.375
Your hands sticky from candy.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.895
And the worst part is, I wouldn't even want the money.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.390
No, you wouldn't. Jack Donaghy taking welfare? It'd kill you.

18:56.425 --> 18:58.850
- With so many jobs at stake...
- You'd have to take it.

18:58.885 --> 19:00.842
I'd make you. I'd make you take it all.

19:00.877 --> 19:02.765
I'd roll over and let you give it to me.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.920
I'm honestly not trying to make this sound gay.

19:04.955 --> 19:08.185
No one is. It's just happening.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.900
One word to the president, and I own you.

19:10.935 --> 19:12.275
I own this office.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.600
I own that... Fancy little fellow outside.

19:15.635 --> 19:17.455
It'd kill me.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.210
But I'd do it for the company.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.535
Hey, Sasha. Is your dad home?

19:24.570 --> 19:29.580
What? You have to invite everyone to your party? Even Zach S.

19:30.610 --> 19:32.730
Everyone settle.

19:32.765 --> 19:35.405
And action.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.845
It's not just about the new cast member.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.990
When you always put the show ahead of me, it makes me feel like we're growing apart.

19:42.025 --> 19:44.970
Jenna... You're my friend.

19:45.005 --> 19:46.845
No matter what.

19:46.880 --> 19:52.085
I will always look after you. That's not going to change.

19:52.120 --> 19:57.290
Oh, Liz, thank you for giving me the hotter porn lady.

20:01.380 --> 20:03.840
Okay... we should get out of here.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.790
Yeah, we should.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.325
Everything good with Tracy?

20:12.360 --> 20:17.550
I think so. And Jenna and Frank and even Subhas. And you?

20:17.585 --> 20:19.997
I live to fight another day. But at what cost?

20:20.032 --> 20:23.056
Oh, boy, I know the fling. What a week, huh?

20:23.091 --> 20:26.080
Lemon, it's Wednesday. But it's not all...

20:26.115 --> 20:27.425
Bad news.

20:27.460 --> 20:32.390
My retainer. Now my dad won't be mad at me.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.915
Take it out, Lemon!

20:43.950 --> 20:46.125
You take it out, Donaghy!

20:46.160 --> 20:48.265
Everyhing good with Tracy?

20:48.300 --> 20:52.570
I think so, and Jenna too, and Frank, and even Subhas.

20:52.605 --> 20:54.035
And you?

20:54.070 --> 20:55.740
I live to fight another day.

20:55.775 --> 20:57.185
But at what cost?

20:57.220 --> 20:59.180
Boy, I know the feeling.

20:59.215 --> 21:00.545
What a week, huh?

21:00.580 --> 21:03.900
Lemon, it's Wednesday.

21:03.935 --> 21:07.220
But it's not all bad news.

21:07.490 --> 21:10.235
My retainer.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.635
How will I ever thank you?

21:12.670 --> 21:16.010
And cut. This is disgusting. Shut it down.
