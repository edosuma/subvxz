00:05.120 --> 00:07.240
Our world is not always the same.

00:09.420 --> 00:12.340
Hidden from our view lies a
different world.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.500
Creatures utterly unlike us.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.500
(THUNDER CRASHES)

00:18.620 --> 00:19.900
Almost alien.

00:21.940 --> 00:25.220
Yet they are more numerous
than any other group on the planet.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.900
Welcome to the fascinating
world of the arthropods.

00:35.220 --> 00:39.860
Spiders, scorpions and insects.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.940
Today we have new camera techniques

00:43.160 --> 00:45.880
that will allow us to reveal in
greater detail

00:46.300 --> 00:48.780
than ever before their lives.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.480
The way they fight and feed and
reproduce.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.320
This series uses specially developed
3D camera technology

00:57.440 --> 01:01.080
to study the micro world in
extraordinary detail,

01:01.400 --> 01:04.800
both on location and in specially
constructed environments.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.740
We'll witness their births, the
challenges they face,

01:09.160 --> 01:11.840
and the moments when their lives
hang in the balance.

01:13.420 --> 01:17.220
And that may help us understand
how it is that today

01:17.440 --> 01:22.880
over 80% of all animal species on
this planet are arthropods.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.480
In this series we will see the way
they have evolved.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.240
From the comparative simplicity of
the millipede,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.360
to vast colonies that contain
hundreds, even millions,

01:34.480 --> 01:35.520
of individuals.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.980
We'll witness the most extraordinary
transformations

01:41.100 --> 01:42.620
in the animal kingdom.

01:43.820 --> 01:46.140
We'll meet ants that farm,

01:46.760 --> 01:49.720
spiders that can cast their webs...

01:51.360 --> 01:55.080
..and the bug that wears the bodies
of its victims as a disguise.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.520
Welcome to a strange
and dangerous world.

02:17.320 --> 02:22.640
Our planet's rainforests are home to
millions of animal species.

02:22.760 --> 02:27.560
Nearly 90% of them are arthropods,
some call them bugs,

02:27.880 --> 02:30.440
and they're all searching for food.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.800
In fact, there's food for most of
them everywhere,

02:34.120 --> 02:37.280
because over half
of all bugs eat plants.

02:54.280 --> 02:58.720
Millipedes were among the first
arthropods to move up

02:59.040 --> 03:01.600
out of the water onto the land.

03:01.820 --> 03:04.820
They can have up to 750 legs,

03:05.240 --> 03:09.920
grow to lengths of 30 centimetres
and live for as long as seven years.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.200
And this body plan is so efficient

03:13.520 --> 03:18.480
that it's remained largely unchanged
for hundreds of millions of years.

03:23.980 --> 03:28.140
Their body is divided into segments,
each with its own set of legs

03:28.260 --> 03:30.180
and internal organs.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.720
A heart runs
the entire length of it,

03:32.840 --> 03:34.960
supplying each segment with oxygen.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.760
It eats decaying leaves and plants,

03:42.880 --> 03:46.320
just as its ancestors did
over 400 million years ago.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.940
Millipedes are peaceful creatures,

03:56.160 --> 03:58.640
but they don't have
the forest to themselves.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.400
There are other multi-segmented
creatures here

04:04.720 --> 04:06.800
that have a very different
way of life.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.560
Centipedes.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.779
They are meat eaters.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.980
Centipedes are closely
related to millipedes,

04:22.100 --> 04:23.900
and they prey on other bugs.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.820
There are over 8,000
species of them,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.560
and they all have poisonous stings.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.320
This one lives in caves in India.

04:34.660 --> 04:37.220
Their powerful, independently
moving legs

04:37.440 --> 04:39.960
make them much faster than
millipedes.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.660
This is the one to be feared most -

04:50.780 --> 04:53.131
meet Scolapendra.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.360
But it's not the only top
predator here.

05:17.060 --> 05:19.940
This Red Claw Scorpion from Tanzania

05:20.060 --> 05:22.020
is not as fast or as agile,

05:22.340 --> 05:24.580
but its powerful pincers and sting

05:24.800 --> 05:26.600
make it every bit as deadly.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.920
Scorpions and centipedes are
competitors.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.440
They hunt the same prey...

05:42.260 --> 05:44.260
..and in the same territory.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.740
And because of that,

05:47.860 --> 05:49.540
if they meet, they fight.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.480
Scolapendra uses all its strength

06:22.600 --> 06:25.720
to try and get under
Red Claw's armour.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.720
But the scorpion's defences
are too strong.

06:41.260 --> 06:44.740
It's not Red Claw's attack
that wins the day,

06:44.960 --> 06:47.800
it's Scolapendra's weak
defence that loses it.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.400
If you can't defend yourself,

06:52.820 --> 06:56.740
you're not likely to stay alive
for long in the micro-world.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.380
Australia.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.660
Home to a beetle with one of the
oddest defences.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.160
This is a pie dish beetle.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.320
The outback certainly gets very dry,

07:16.440 --> 07:18.600
so you might think
that this strange shell

07:18.720 --> 07:20.800
is just for collecting water,

07:21.020 --> 07:23.700
but its primary function is defence.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.860
A Mantis.

07:29.980 --> 07:33.300
Normally a hunter,
but with this potential prey,

07:33.420 --> 07:35.540
it doesn't know how to even begin.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.400
But the pie dish beetle's armour

07:58.520 --> 08:01.120
does have its disadvantages -

08:01.740 --> 08:05.020
it's not what you
might call manoeuvrable.

08:39.140 --> 08:43.100
Other Australian insects have a
different defensive strategy.

08:49.300 --> 08:54.460
This stick insect relies on
camouflage to make it invisible,

08:54.580 --> 08:57.100
but that too comes at a cost.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.240
Being shaped like a stick
makes it difficult to fly.

09:01.460 --> 09:05.180
So if a predator does find it,
it could be done for.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.640
A huntsman spider -
and it's ready to strike.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.200
It's one of the fastest
and most agile of all spiders.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.780
But the stick insect
doesn't even try to escape.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.340
She has a weapon of last resort.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.580
A milky substance
from the glands behind her head.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.440
The spray can reach half a metre,

10:15.560 --> 10:19.381
and she'll have enough to have
a few goes before running dry.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.260
It fills the forest with
the scent of peppermint.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.000
To the huntsman,
it's an unbearable irritant.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.466
So the stick insect is free
to graze in peace.

10:51.020 --> 10:53.260
Ever since they first appeared
on land,

10:53.380 --> 10:56.380
the arthropods have been fighting
one and other -

10:56.600 --> 11:00.360
over food, over territory,
over a mate.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.720
The ways they have developed
in order to do so

11:04.140 --> 11:05.780
are truly astonishing.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.280
On the floor of forests almost
anywhere in the world,

11:13.500 --> 11:15.260
you'll find these -

11:15.480 --> 11:16.880
bombardier beetles.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.400
They look fairly harmless,

11:24.720 --> 11:27.720
but not many creatures are foolhardy
enough to try and eat them.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.200
A mantis.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.760
Some mantises are so large
and strong,

11:35.180 --> 11:38.180
they can even kill small birds.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.580
A beetle should be easy.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.340
But not this one.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.600
A fraction of a second after
the mantis strikes,

11:56.020 --> 12:00.180
the beetle squirts hot gas
and caustic chemicals in its face.

12:06.380 --> 12:09.180
The chemicals are produced
by a reaction in its abdomen,

12:09.600 --> 12:13.640
which generates enough heat to bring
the liquid close to boiling point.

12:21.680 --> 12:25.280
The bombardier's spray can be
deadly to smaller creatures...

12:26.700 --> 12:29.580
..but the mantis is large
and it survives.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.167
As does the beetle.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.720
On the African savannah,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.240
there's a hunter that sets its traps

12:43.460 --> 12:45.660
wherever there is dust or dry sand.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.720
This is the lava of an ant-lion.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.980
As an adult, it will look
something like a dragonfly,

12:59.200 --> 13:02.000
and then its sole purpose
will be to mate.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.760
It'll barely even eat.

13:04.180 --> 13:09.060
But now as a larva,
its task is to feed and grow.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.360
To do that, it digs a pit trap
in the sand,

13:12.480 --> 13:16.573
and buries itself at the bottom,
jaws uppermost.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.740
It can jerk its head so violently

13:27.960 --> 13:30.680
that it can shoot up sand grains
like bullets.

13:35.780 --> 13:37.260
And now it waits.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.180
An ant wanders into the pit...

13:48.740 --> 13:50.100
..and loses its foothold.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.480
The ant can't climb out.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.860
The sand slips from under its feet.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.160
Eventually, it tires.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.840
And the ant-lion drags
it beneath the sand...

14:23.960 --> 14:25.080
and devours it.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.840
For the ant-lion, remaining hidden
is a good way to hunt.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.840
And there are a multitude
of places to do that

14:43.960 --> 14:45.040
in a forest.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.160
Here there are predators
that set perhaps the most

14:50.280 --> 14:52.280
perfect of all ambushes.

14:55.400 --> 15:01.020
This female trapdoor spider lives
in a burrow with a camouflaged lid.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.760
And she'll stay here
for her entire 20-year life.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.120
Around the burrow,

15:17.240 --> 15:21.160
she's laid out a network
of invisibly fine strands of silk.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.500
She'll pounce on anything
that trips on them.

15:26.660 --> 15:30.980
Occasionally, she tests to see
that her door opens smoothly.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.820
But mostly, she waits.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.240
A cricket.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.680
Got it.

16:05.220 --> 16:08.380
She pulls her prey into the burrow -

16:08.500 --> 16:11.900
so that she can eat it in safety
and at her leisure.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.040
But some bugs have
such perfect camouflage

16:24.160 --> 16:25.600
they're virtually invisible,

16:25.720 --> 16:27.440
even though they're totally exposed.

16:34.740 --> 16:38.980
Predators use camouflage
to hunt their prey unseen.

16:39.300 --> 16:43.580
Their victims use it to avoid
being found and eaten.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.501
But disguise can be a potent weapon.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.560
In the forests of East Africa,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.080
one insect has taken its camouflage

16:57.500 --> 17:00.500
to a bizarre and somewhat
gruesome extreme.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.260
This is an assassin bug.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.680
To us, it's easy enough to spot
because it moves.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.280
To its prey, that's irrelevant

17:21.400 --> 17:24.703
because it smells
like one of their number.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.980
The assassin sucks its victims dry

17:39.100 --> 17:42.380
and glues their empty
husks onto its back.

17:42.500 --> 17:47.821
This one is already carrying
at least 20 corpses.

18:05.500 --> 18:09.460
Its irregular shape makes it hard
for other predators to spot it...

18:11.740 --> 18:16.060
..and makes it virtually invisible
to its prey - ants.

18:25.700 --> 18:29.020
It enters this ant colony
unchallenged.

18:32.500 --> 18:36.060
Its coat of ant corpses
masks its own odour.

18:36.180 --> 18:39.300
To the ants, it smells
like one of their own,

18:39.420 --> 18:40.780
and that's what matters.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.700
They'll even run straight
over the top of it.

18:54.040 --> 18:58.080
The assassin simply takes an ant
whenever it feels hungry.

19:03.840 --> 19:09.170
And the body of each victim
then adds to its disguise.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.840
Conflict pervades the bug world.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.600
It shapes their bodies.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.200
It dictates their lifestyles.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.420
The ant-lions beneath the sand.

19:50.540 --> 19:54.396
The trapdoor spiders -
20 years in a burrow.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.740
And it's their extraordinary
diversity

20:10.860 --> 20:13.060
that underpins their success.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.360
In the next programme,
I'll look at arthropod predators.

20:24.820 --> 20:28.824
These are the creatures that must
kill in order to eat.

20:31.900 --> 20:35.100
They have evolved the most
extraordinary ways to do so.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.643
And they take many forms.

20:47.820 --> 20:52.580
We'll meet a spider that has
turned its web into a casting net.

20:55.540 --> 20:59.380
We'll witness the ingenious hunting
tactics of another spider

21:00.000 --> 21:01.800
that preys on its fellows.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.480
We'll meet creatures that use
the surface of water

21:07.600 --> 21:10.675
like a radar dish
to detect their prey.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.120
And an extraordinary wasp
that tames a cockroach

21:16.240 --> 21:18.600
so her young can eat it alive.

21:23.400 --> 21:28.115
We'll encounter the most deadly
creatures of the micro-world.

21:28.139 --> 21:35.139
