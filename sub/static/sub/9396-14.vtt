00:02.302 --> 00:04.236
<i>Okay, here's what you need to know.</i>

00:04.304 --> 00:06.534
I'll tell you what. I'll leave them alone.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.333
You move in with me.

00:08.575 --> 00:09.769
I'm running for president.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.505
You realize I've been class president
since seventh grade.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.843
-Well, game on, Viveca.
-Erica.

00:15.448 --> 00:16.472
Whatever.

00:16.883 --> 00:20.546
If you'd just tell me what Dan has
said or done, we could fight him together.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.817
No. Mom, we can't.

00:29.662 --> 00:32.357
Go back to sleep. I've got her.

00:34.300 --> 00:37.167
I'm the one who threw
the brick through your car window.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.865
I'm not sure we can be friends anymore,
Mouth.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.602
If you want to go, you should go.

00:44.444 --> 00:48.403
If you do, we're done.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.415
Turns out that popular people don't vote.

00:52.485 --> 00:55.579
And now that Felix has bailed
on me three days before the election....

00:55.655 --> 00:57.520
Who goes on a cruise
during the school week?

00:57.590 --> 00:58.614
Rich people.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.390
Haley.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.357
I'm sorry, Nathan. She's gone.

You know, if Bogans keeps draining
threes, the Cats will be tough to beat.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.042
-How did you sleep?
-Fine.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.602
-Great. Grab a plate.
-Actually, I usually grab something...

02:27.680 --> 02:29.614
-on the way to school.
-Come on, sit.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.650
We're civilized here.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.044
Dan? I'm home.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.587
We're in the kitchen, Deb.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.784
-Lucas?
-Hey.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.396
-Where's Nathan?
-Nathan's not here, Deb.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.692
Lucas is going be staying
with us for a while.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.999
-What?
-You didn't tell her.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.401
You better get to school.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.749
Nice work, Deb.
That should make him feel right at home.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.875
This isn't his home, Dan.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.913
What were you thinking?
I'm gone three days, and you invite...

03:09.989 --> 03:12.219
Lucas to stay in our son's room
without asking me?

03:12.292 --> 03:13.657
Hey, Lucas is my son, too, Deb.

03:13.726 --> 03:16.456
And before you start getting upset,
there is some good news.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.089
Like what?
Keith's moved into the guest room?

03:19.499 --> 03:21.490
Haley left Nathan.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.663
-When?
-A few days ago.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.903
It's happening, Deb.
Just like we hoped it would.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.435
How is he? He must be devastated.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.070
Well, ask him yourself
when he moves back in.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.250
-He's moving back in? He said that?
-Not yet.

03:38.484 --> 03:42.045
But trust me. It's just a matter of time.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.554
Okay. I still cannot believe
Haley left Nathan for Chris.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.860
She didn't, okay. She left for herself.

03:52.932 --> 03:56.231
-The tour is an amazing opportunity.
-Yeah, to screw up her marriage.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.293
Okay, just because she is married...

03:58.371 --> 04:00.965
does not mean
she has to give up her dreams, okay?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.337
She's really, really talented.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.899
I know she is, and that's great.
But you don't think...

04:04.978 --> 04:07.446
-Chris has anything to do with this?
-No. I don't.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.981
-She is not into him. She told me.
-Okay.

04:10.216 --> 04:12.946
Let's think about
what Nathan was when Haley met him.

04:13.052 --> 04:17.045
Good looking, rude, sexy, arrogant...

04:17.523 --> 04:19.649
-and talented.
-Okay, right. Like Chris.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.991
Yeah. And then Haley changed Nathan,
for the better.

04:23.229 --> 04:26.255
But I'm thinking
maybe she misses that challenge.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.732
-You really think she changed Nathan?
-Yeah.

04:28.801 --> 04:32.567
I mean, before Haley, Nathan was like
the bad boy of Tree Hill.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.272
And now he's just pod Nathan.

04:36.976 --> 04:40.707
<i>Bryant takes the shot.</i>
<i>Hamilton sends it right back at him.</i>

04:45.418 --> 04:47.886
<i>Fox takes the jumper and nails it!</i>

04:58.031 --> 05:01.728
-Dude. You look like ass.
-You should smell me.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.998
You know I haven't seen you
around school lately.

05:06.205 --> 05:09.368
-You mind if I come in?
-Actually, now's not really...

05:09.442 --> 05:11.740
a good time.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.211
You know, man, I....

05:16.849 --> 05:18.840
I'm really missing Haley.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.612
She didn't even bother to call me.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.456
-It must be harder for you.
-Yeah.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.824
It's 12 weeks. I'll be fine.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.159
We'll work it out when she gets back.

05:32.899 --> 05:36.835
-I'm just concerned, man.
-Yeah. Well, don't be. Thanks.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.773
So, you left early this morning.

05:49.882 --> 05:52.749
Yeah, well, I had to drop off Jenny
at my mom's, and then...

05:52.819 --> 05:55.617
stop by the cafe, talk to Karen.
What's going on?

05:55.688 --> 05:57.280
Well...

05:57.590 --> 06:01.185
Ted Leo is doing an in-store
in Raleigh tonight. Do you wanna go?

06:01.294 --> 06:03.660
-I can't.
-Come on. It's gonna be fun.

06:03.763 --> 06:07.494
Yeah, well, fun's not really an option
these days. I mean other than Jenny...

06:07.567 --> 06:11.128
school, finding a job,
there's not really room for anything else.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.828
Yeah. Sure.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.364
I understand. It's cool.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.578
You coming?

06:26.919 --> 06:30.514
-Campaign CD?
-No. I'm more of an MP3 girl.

06:34.994 --> 06:38.054
Coach Durham, I was wondering
if the Election Week event...

06:38.131 --> 06:40.725
-schedules were out yet?
-Yeah, hot off the press.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.994
Thanks.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.660
If you want,
I can give Brooke Davis hers next period.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.571
-We have Health together.
-Well, that's nice of you, Erica.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.633
I was afraid you girls would be pulling
each other's pigtails...

06:51.711 --> 06:53.178
by this time.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.449
I know I've been a little busy
with the election, but how could you...

07:06.526 --> 07:08.084
-hold out on me like this?
-What?

07:08.161 --> 07:11.153
Don't play dumb with me, Blondie.
You've been playing house...

07:11.230 --> 07:13.255
with Jake Jaglieski
and you weren't gonna tell me?

07:13.332 --> 07:15.994
-That? That's nothing.
-I would say that living in a house...

07:16.068 --> 07:18.161
together with a baby
is definitely something.

07:18.237 --> 07:22.196
Next thing I know you're gonna tell me
that you two have been sharing a bed.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.006
P. Sawyer! Hey, freshman.
Hang these up for me. Thanks.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.842
-Okay, give me details.
-Sadly, there aren't any.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.078
Jake's made it clear that he doesn't
have time for anything detaily.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.984
Okay, no. Forget what he says.
Because I have seen the way that...

07:35.054 --> 07:38.023
-that boy looks at you.
-Okay, don't you have Health class?

07:38.090 --> 07:41.753
I think I'm healthy enough. I've watched
you mope over this guy for weeks.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.796
-Now you have him in your bed.
-So?

07:43.863 --> 07:45.888
So take a chance.

07:48.367 --> 07:52.235
So, we're going to pick up where we
left off, discussing the process of mitosis.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.199
Well, Mr. Scott, long time no see.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.302
Okay. So, as we discussed last time...

08:00.379 --> 08:02.870
mitosis is the process
by which a single cell....

08:02.949 --> 08:04.917
It's about time
you pulled yourself together.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.782
Whatever. I'm only here
because my PlayStation broke.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.981
-They are interphase...
-What are you, nuts?

08:10.056 --> 08:14.459
...prophase, prometaphase,
anaphase, and....

08:16.128 --> 08:19.689
Okay, please tell me
you are not drinking beer in my class.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.624
Technically, it's malt liquor.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.931
-Nathan!
-It's okay. I brought enough to share.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.139
Come with me, please.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.006
That's a nice skirt, Ms. Hand.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.741
You know, I bet
if more teachers dressed like sluts...

08:36.816 --> 08:39.250
attendance in this place would skyrocket.

08:39.318 --> 08:42.253
Funny. Principal Turner's gonna
love that one.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.590
Haley, it's me.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.869
I don't know if you're even getting
any of these messages...

08:59.939 --> 09:03.875
but please call me. It's Nathan.
I'm worried about him.

09:09.181 --> 09:12.617
-Hey, you ready? Let's go.
-Yeah, just one second.

09:13.352 --> 09:16.082
I just saw you. You look great. Come on.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.726
She felt a little warm earlier.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.825
-You think she caught something?
-I don't know. Hey, come here.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.199
How you doing, girly-girl?
How you feeling?

09:34.974 --> 09:37.534
-Okay, not good, I guess.
-Come here.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.912
-Here, here.
-I got her.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.946
It's okay. Here.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.912
You get that.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.914
You go ahead. She can't go out like this.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.980
Stop it. I will go with you.
We'll take her to the doctor.

09:52.058 --> 09:55.494
With what? I don't have health insurance.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.327
-It's okay.
-You know what.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.969
Here.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.535
It's the emergency money my dad left me.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.501
-Peyton, I can't.
-Jake.

10:10.643 --> 10:13.942
Come on. What's a bigger emergency
than a sick baby?

10:20.753 --> 10:24.587
-You're pretty great, you know that?
-Yeah, I have my moments.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.627
Hey, Andy. You seen my mom?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.730
Lucas.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.202
I think I'll grade these somewhere else.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.838
-You need help with those?
-Got them.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.181
Didn't expect to see you today.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.984
Sit down. Have a drink.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.917
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.120
What does Dan have over you?

11:04.563 --> 11:06.428
-Mom.
-It's got to be something...

11:06.499 --> 11:10.265
because I've gone over this a million times
and there's no other explanation...

11:10.336 --> 11:13.533
as to why you would chose
to live with that snake.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.273
So, unless you want to tell me...

11:23.382 --> 11:25.543
it's $2 for the soda.

11:34.493 --> 11:37.758
-You want to explain this?
-It looks like a wedding gown.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.661
No one asked you to pay for my dress.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.462
You know, most women
would have just sent a thank-you note.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.936
But if you're gonna yell at me,
at least come inside.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.100
I want you to stay away from our wedding.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.144
Speaking of your wedding...

11:52.244 --> 11:55.077
what exactly were you planning
to do about guests?

11:55.147 --> 11:58.378
I mean, considering this whole thing
was just an elaborate ruse...

11:58.451 --> 12:00.578
designed to bring down my brother.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.214
I'm guessing that having your parents
there might be a bit of a downer.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.724
I could lend you mine, but, no.

12:07.026 --> 12:10.518
I love your brother, Dan.
Why won't you just leave us alone?

12:11.097 --> 12:13.258
Because Keith slept with Deb.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.430
Besides, I didn't pay you
to fall in love with him.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.504
You know what?
Screw it! I'll just tell him the truth.

12:19.605 --> 12:22.335
Yeah, you could do that. Risky, though.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.511
Keith's no catch, but I'm guessing even
he'd have trouble dealing with this one.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.377
You like chess, Jules?

12:34.019 --> 12:38.217
Keith and I used to play all the time.
Until he got tired of losing.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.957
There's a maneuver, it's called the fork...

12:42.027 --> 12:45.622
where you take one of your pieces and
attack two of your opponent's pieces...

12:45.698 --> 12:48.599
basically forcing him to choose
which way he wants to lose.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.270
It makes it fun
'cause you get to watch him squirm.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.273
Sort of like the situation you're in now.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.604
I mean, you could tell Keith
about our arrangement...

12:59.678 --> 13:03.307
break his heart.
Which, of course, was my plan all along...

13:05.151 --> 13:06.743
What is wrong with you?

13:06.919 --> 13:11.015
...or you could go through with the
wedding. Put on the pretty dress...

13:11.257 --> 13:13.487
and spend the rest of your married life...

13:13.559 --> 13:17.359
knowing that I have the luxury
of telling him anytime I want.

13:17.696 --> 13:20.824
Either way, in the end, I win.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.437
Checkmate.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.688
-Lucas.
-We got a call from the principal.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.828
Yeah, I was just checking on him.
Since you guys are here--

13:56.001 --> 13:59.027
Stay. You're his brother.
You should be here for this.

14:05.711 --> 14:10.080
-Look who it is. The Scott family.
-Sorry. I thought my son lived here.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.208
He kind of looks like you.
Only less pathetic.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.252
We heard about Haley, honey.
What happened?

14:17.456 --> 14:18.980
Like you care.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.360
-We do care, Nathan. AII of us.
-Right, Mom.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.120
You just showered Haley with hugs,
didn't you?

14:25.197 --> 14:28.598
Well, I hate to disappoint you guys,
but she'll be back in a few weeks.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.534
-Look, Nate--
-You can shut up, by the way.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.474
How can you live like this, Nathan?
This place is a pigsty.

14:36.942 --> 14:40.139
You're skipping school.
You're drinking in class.

14:40.212 --> 14:44.205
It's not worth it, son.
Pissing your life away over some girl.

14:45.084 --> 14:49.111
-Some girl? She's my wife, Dad.
-Really?

14:49.421 --> 14:51.821
Well, someone may want to tell her that.

14:52.925 --> 14:54.392
Hey, come on!

15:02.001 --> 15:06.461
Nice punch, son. It's good to see
there's still a man in there somewhere.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.190
Nathan.

15:56.155 --> 15:57.486
Come here.

15:58.757 --> 16:03.126
First of all. No, you didn't.
And second of all, where did you get it?

16:03.195 --> 16:05.823
-It's a joke.
-Spill.

16:10.269 --> 16:13.500
Erica! Very clever.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.163
Thanks. Cleverness does come in handy
in politics...

16:16.275 --> 16:18.641
unlike, say, cheerleading,
which is about, what?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.680
Short skirts and who can make
the bitchingest pyramid?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.411
That is it. Tomorrow you're going down.

16:24.483 --> 16:29.011
Are you sure? 'Cause from what I've heard,
going down is really more your style.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.896
Sorry. This is the Athletic Department.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.492
Mommy and Me classes
are around the corner at the Y.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.669
Good to see you, too, Coach.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.401
Jaglieski. For someone who's eager
to get back in school...

16:51.477 --> 16:54.537
-you've got a funny way of showing it.
-Sorry. Jenny's been sick.

16:54.613 --> 16:55.978
I had to stay home with her.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.312
Sick? Here, do you mind?

16:59.985 --> 17:04.012
-You know anything about babies, Coach?
-I know more than they know about me.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.646
Right. Look...

17:05.758 --> 17:08.521
I know that you've done a lot
to get me back in here, but...

17:08.594 --> 17:11.893
any mistake I make with Jenny
could just make it easier for a judge...

17:11.964 --> 17:13.795
to give joint custody to Nicki.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.165
Mistake?
You mean like dropping out of school.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.098
I know.

17:21.306 --> 17:24.400
-You're right.
-Hell, yes, I'm right. Now get your...

17:24.910 --> 17:28.971
A-S-S back to class.
I'll take care of little Miss Jaglieski here.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.815
-Okay.
-Go on. Get out of here.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.820
Thanks, Coach.

17:40.392 --> 17:44.556
Well, I hope you didn't inherit
your daddy's free throw percentage.

17:51.937 --> 17:54.599
Nathan. Hey.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.476
Have you heard from her?

18:00.479 --> 18:01.537
No.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.481
I would have never booked that show
if I'd known that Chris was gonna be there.

18:12.558 --> 18:16.722
Not your fault. Haley's a big girl.
Nobody made her get on that bus.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.327
Except for maybe me.

18:25.737 --> 18:29.104
So. You and Jaglieski.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.274
What's the deal? You two together?

18:33.679 --> 18:35.943
No. We're just....

18:38.150 --> 18:40.243
I don't really know what we are.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.582
Looks pretty serious to me.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.223
Not really.

18:47.826 --> 18:51.057
I don't think there's a possibility
for me and Jake for...

18:51.663 --> 18:53.324
a lot of reasons.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.191
Trust me, you're better off anyway.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.731
-Love sucks.
-Nathan.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.234
Think about it. Dan and Karen.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.572
You and Lucas. Me and Haley.

19:12.951 --> 19:14.851
You got it right, Peyton.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.918
People always leave.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.948
-Hey.
-I just had to see it for myself.

19:47.886 --> 19:51.117
-See what?
-This. You here.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.890
Look. Nathan, it's complicated.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.726
You're a fraud, Lucas.
There's nothing complicated about that.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.958
Look, why don't you
just come inside, man?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.433
So now you're gonna invite me
into my own house?

20:03.502 --> 20:05.834
-It's not like that.
-No, it is like that, Lucas.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.804
It's exactly like that.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.400
Do you realize I wouldn't be in this
situation if it wasn't for you?

20:11.476 --> 20:13.808
If you would've stayed
in your place at the River Court...

20:13.879 --> 20:15.244
I would've never met Haley.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.845
-You ruined my life, man.
-Nathan.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.579
You better watch your back.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.028
What did he want?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.235
Haley.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.015
Vote for Brooke, get a makeover.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.290
Let's put a whole new face
on Tree Hill High, people!

21:04.596 --> 21:06.257
Here you go.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.224
Damn it, Bevin.

21:11.503 --> 21:14.370
What was that? Did Erica just convince
you to vote for her?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.930
No. But she made some good points.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.601
-Bevin!
-She said that if you were...

21:18.677 --> 21:21.805
elected president, you wouldn't have time
for the cheerleading squad.

21:22.714 --> 21:25.012
-You are the best captain ever.
-So?

21:25.117 --> 21:29.554
Brooke, the cheerleading squad needs you.
So much more than America does.

21:30.155 --> 21:34.854
Bevin, you realize I'm not running
for President of the United States, right?

21:39.965 --> 21:43.594
Wow. The makeover booth
looks very popular.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.638
Yeah, but it doesn't matter
because Erica is so much better...

21:46.705 --> 21:48.605
at the dirty politicking than I am.

21:48.674 --> 21:51.768
-Come on. You can get dirty.
-Lucas!

21:52.377 --> 21:54.902
Don't worry. You'll be great.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.141
How do you know?

21:58.250 --> 22:00.047
It's just a feeling.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.551
Time to wrap up the beauty bar,
Ms. Davis.

22:04.923 --> 22:08.222
The Peer Endorsement Assembly
starts in 10 minutes.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.324
Will do, Coach. Wait.

22:11.196 --> 22:13.357
-The what?
-Peer Endorsement.

22:13.532 --> 22:17.093
You know, where you introduce somebody
who speaks on your behalf?

22:17.969 --> 22:22.406
You didn't forget did you? It was
in the schedule that Erica gave you.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.544
You're going to vote for me, right? Okay.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.147
-That is so....
-It was, was it?

22:43.395 --> 22:45.886
-It's Andy, isn't it?
-That's right.

22:45.997 --> 22:49.933
-What can I do for you?
-Well, it's a little awkward, actually.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.100
Kind of a favor, I guess you'd call it.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.167
-Okay.
-Let Lucas go.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.011
It's the right thing to do.
And it needs to happen. Now.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.715
You've got some balls, kid.

23:12.791 --> 23:16.249
-But this is none of your concern.
-Was none of my concern...

23:16.328 --> 23:18.262
until you hurt the woman I love.

23:20.298 --> 23:22.766
-It's love, is it?
-That's right.

23:23.168 --> 23:27.036
Well, congratulations.
Now get out of my dealership.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.869
Well, just so you know, mate.

23:30.809 --> 23:33.004
I do tend to get what I want.

23:38.683 --> 23:40.617
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.851
It's the strangest thing.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.589
It just seems to happen that way.

24:02.207 --> 24:06.268
<i>It was a thrill to be asked by Erica</i>
<i>to be her peer advocate.</i>

24:06.445 --> 24:09.437
<i>Because,</i>
<i>in addition to being her principal...</i>

24:09.514 --> 24:12.074
<i>I also consider myself her friend.</i>

24:12.784 --> 24:15.981
<i>Now, of course, there is a</i>
<i>considerable age difference between us....</i>

24:16.054 --> 24:18.215
That little bitch! Double-crosses me...

24:18.290 --> 24:21.726
and gets the principal
to be her peer advocate. Great!

24:24.362 --> 24:28.492
<i>...from organizing food drives, to</i>
<i>raising money so our folk-dancing team...</i>

24:28.567 --> 24:31.263
<i>-could travel to the regional finals--</i>
-Hi!

24:31.336 --> 24:34.100
I'm gonna need you to do me a little favor.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.664
<i>And that's why I encourage you</i>
<i>to vote for this marvelous young lady...</i>

24:37.742 --> 24:41.610
<i>who wasn't afraid to say,</i>
<i>''Hey, world, get a load of me. ''</i>

24:42.881 --> 24:46.612
<i>I'm proud to endorse your president,</i>
<i>Erica Marsh.</i>

24:53.658 --> 24:55.785
<i>Thank you, Principal Turner.</i>

24:57.028 --> 25:00.691
<i>Now, to introduce her peer advocate...</i>

25:01.166 --> 25:03.532
<i>here is candidate Brooke Davis.</i>

25:12.244 --> 25:17.045
<i>Hi. Due to an unforeseen circumstance...</i>

25:17.215 --> 25:20.309
<i>I arrived today</i>
<i>without anyone to speak for me.</i>

25:20.619 --> 25:23.918
<i>But, luckily, I had a volunteer backstage.</i>

25:24.456 --> 25:27.948
<i>And that person is Erica,</i>
<i>the backstabbing sock puppet.</i>

25:32.464 --> 25:36.264
<i>Hi, I'm Erica. I sure do stink.</i>

25:36.568 --> 25:40.026
<i>And did you know that I have to cheat</i>
<i>to win my elections, too?</i>

25:40.372 --> 25:41.737
<i>Really?</i>

25:46.845 --> 25:51.214
I appreciate the attempt, hon,
but you've got to have an actual person.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.113
I know that, but I don't. Because of Erica.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.048
I'll speak for her.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.858
Do your thing, Mouth.

26:14.973 --> 26:18.704
<i>We just heard Principal Turner</i>
<i>read a list of Erica's accomplishments.</i>

26:18.843 --> 26:23.303
<i>I could try to do that for Brooke</i>
<i>but it would be kind of a short speech.</i>

26:28.253 --> 26:32.690
<i>As you know, Brooke's probably one</i>
<i>of the most popular people in school.</i>

26:33.058 --> 26:35.288
<i>Something I'm definitely not.</i>

26:35.827 --> 26:37.852
<i>And yet she's my friend.</i>

26:38.029 --> 26:40.691
<i>She never cared what clique</i>
<i>I was part of...</i>

26:40.765 --> 26:44.997
<i>the kinds of clothes I wore,</i>
<i>or the fact that I have to ride the bus.</i>

26:45.737 --> 26:47.864
<i>She looked past that stuff.</i>

26:48.773 --> 26:53.039
<i>And when you think about it,</i>
<i>isn't that what we want in our president?</i>

26:53.645 --> 26:56.478
<i>Someone who can see past</i>
<i>the superficial differences...</i>

26:56.548 --> 26:58.413
<i>and bring us together?</i>

27:01.186 --> 27:04.553
<i>This year, Brooke's had her share</i>
<i>of ups and downs.</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:07.720
<i>Just like all of us.</i>

27:08.026 --> 27:10.256
<i>But most of you never saw it.</i>

27:10.328 --> 27:13.889
<i>Because even when life got hard,</i>
<i>Brooke never let it in.</i>

27:14.766 --> 27:17.564
<i>She was just Brooke.</i>

27:18.970 --> 27:21.632
<i>Tough, smart, one of a kind.</i>

27:23.041 --> 27:27.478
<i>And I don't know about you,</i>
<i>but those are things I look for in a leader.</i>

27:30.782 --> 27:32.807
<i>Brooke Davis is my friend.</i>

27:34.185 --> 27:36.847
<i>But that's not why I'm voting for her.</i>

27:37.222 --> 27:40.714
<i>I'm voting for her</i>
<i>because of her heart and her spirit...</i>

27:41.960 --> 27:44.986
<i>and because she's the best person</i>
<i>for the job.</i>

27:58.510 --> 28:00.000
AII right, Mouth!

28:16.327 --> 28:18.454
You look pretty in that one.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.828
The votes are in, Erica.
You can stop bagging on me now.

28:22.067 --> 28:25.366
I mean it. You look pretty. You always do.

28:27.439 --> 28:30.567
Thanks. What are you still doing here?

28:31.042 --> 28:35.775
Just doing some work in the council office.
Sometimes the job keeps you here late.

28:39.050 --> 28:42.383
Do you know why every year I have
a faculty member speak on my behalf?

28:42.487 --> 28:44.921
I don't know.
Maybe because you're a hideous suck-up?

28:44.989 --> 28:47.856
Because I don't have any friends
that would speak up for me...

28:47.926 --> 28:49.985
like Mouth did for you today.

28:50.195 --> 28:54.359
I mean, after all the great things he said,
I almost voted for you.

28:55.633 --> 28:56.930
I didn't.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.964
Please, Erica, you know a ton of people.
I'm sure there's someone.

29:02.440 --> 29:06.274
Council president is who I am. It's all I am.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.644
Anyway. Good luck tomorrow.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.185
Thanks.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.372
Looks like someone's finally
getting sleepy.

29:40.879 --> 29:43.905
I guess we should try to grab some sleep
while we can.

29:44.015 --> 29:46.142
That's probably a good idea.

29:47.852 --> 29:51.447
You know what, I'm gonna spend
the night in my dad's room tonight.

29:54.325 --> 29:57.021
-Why tonight?
-Actually, from now on.

29:58.329 --> 30:02.356
-What, is Jenny keeping you up?
-Yeah, it's not that. I'm just...

30:02.901 --> 30:04.391
really tired.

30:04.736 --> 30:08.297
You know what? This isn't fair to you.
We'll go to my parents' house, okay?

30:08.373 --> 30:09.840
No, don't go.

30:10.441 --> 30:12.136
Really, it's fine.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.839
Please stay. I....

30:17.916 --> 30:20.077
I'll see you in the morning.

30:38.303 --> 30:42.330
Hey. What, you don't call for three days
and then when you do it's what...

30:43.508 --> 30:47.410
-1:00 in the morning?
-Luke, I'm sorry. I just finished my set.

30:47.478 --> 30:50.038
It's crazy here.
There's so much to tell you.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.548
Yeah, you want to start with
why you left without saying goodbye?

30:53.618 --> 30:55.848
Yeah. I feel awful about that.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.489
Everything just happened so fast.

31:00.825 --> 31:02.315
How's Nathan?

31:05.763 --> 31:09.164
-He misses his wife.
-Lucas, don't do this.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.934
<i>Do what? He needs you.</i>

31:13.171 --> 31:15.230
He said that we were done.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.768
<i>He didn't want you to leave.</i>

31:18.843 --> 31:21.175
He's so in love with you, Hales.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.170
You gotta come back.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.322
Haley, Michelle wants to see you
in her dressing room.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.455
I gotta go.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.390
I'll call you later, okay?

31:54.345 --> 31:57.143
<i>Good morning, Ravens.</i>
<i>The ballots have been counted.</i>

31:57.215 --> 32:00.912
<i>The results of yesterday's</i>
<i>student council election are in.</i>

32:03.288 --> 32:06.382
<i>ln the race for council treasurer...</i>

32:06.524 --> 32:08.924
<i>the winner is Fawn Liebowitz.</i>

32:10.328 --> 32:13.525
<i>Council secretary, Bettina Stone.</i>

32:15.133 --> 32:19.069
<i>Council vice president,</i>
<i>Salmoon Sakajahari.</i>

32:20.405 --> 32:23.841
<i>And finally, your new council president...</i>

32:25.143 --> 32:27.202
<i>Brooke Davis.</i>

32:33.284 --> 32:34.615
Thank you!

32:55.006 --> 32:58.169
Brooke!

33:15.360 --> 33:16.520
Erica.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.922
-Hey.
-I was just packing up.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.800
I'm sorry. About not giving you
the campaign papers.

33:27.572 --> 33:30.666
-I guess it worked out for you anyway.
-I guess.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.769
Listen, I've been thinking
about what you said yesterday.

33:34.946 --> 33:37.574
How being the president
is all that you have.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.411
Yeah?

33:41.619 --> 33:44.986
Well, it turns out that
I have some experience in that arena.

33:45.556 --> 33:48.081
Trying to define yourself as just one thing.

33:50.261 --> 33:51.626
What do you mean?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.658
I was always the rich girl, you know...

33:54.766 --> 33:58.998
with the nice car, and the expensive
shoes, and the fancy house with the pool.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.701
So, when my parents lost their money...

34:03.041 --> 34:06.067
I figured my identity would
disappear with it.

34:06.911 --> 34:08.969
You mean, you're not rich?

34:09.880 --> 34:13.715
$18 at Bargain Mart.
My heels are practically bleeding.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.719
I'm just saying, high school's not over.

34:18.922 --> 34:21.551
You know, there's other things
to look forward to.

34:21.626 --> 34:25.619
There's friends and guys. And the guys.

34:33.237 --> 34:37.230
There's a proposal in the top drawer.
Wireless Internet for the cafeteria.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.542
I think it'd be great.

34:40.344 --> 34:41.572
Thanks.

34:45.248 --> 34:49.777
To tell you the truth.
I'm totally intimidated by this job.

34:52.523 --> 34:53.922
It's funny.

34:54.257 --> 34:58.251
You're scared of what's in here.
I'm scared of what's out there.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.742
-You thinking about Lucas?
-What else?

35:18.416 --> 35:21.715
I've been thinking about what I can do
to help you.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.216
That's sweet, Andy.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.388
But I've looked at every angle.

35:27.825 --> 35:31.693
I'm gonna have to go through the courts.
There's no other way.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.894
Actually. There is another way.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.644
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:48.212 --> 35:50.737
-Sorry, the crying keeping you up?
-No.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.881
It's okay.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.723
You know...

36:03.161 --> 36:05.994
I wasn't entirely honest with you before.

36:06.197 --> 36:07.596
About what?

36:08.599 --> 36:10.533
The reason I came back.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.695
You said you were tired of running.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.872
Yeah, but, that's not the only reason.

36:20.578 --> 36:24.275
See, the whole time that I was gone
I kept thinking about all this stuff...

36:24.348 --> 36:27.545
that I should have done
when I had the chance, but didn't.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.378
Like, what kind of stuff?

36:34.325 --> 36:35.815
I don't know.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.863
Mostly, being with you.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.823
-Wow.
-Yeah.

37:07.124 --> 37:10.616
No. Yeah, I mean that, too.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.164
Jenny. She stopped crying.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.283
Nathan.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.724
Ms. Roe. What are you doing here?

37:44.462 --> 37:46.123
Looking for Lucas.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.922
Why would Lucas be here?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.898
He's got his own court
in Dan Scott's driveway.

38:08.419 --> 38:09.681
Ms. Roe.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.652
I'm sorry my dad was such a dick to you.

38:15.526 --> 38:18.859
I haven't really thought about it much
until lately.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.624
I know that must have really hurt you.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.258
I got over it.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.998
When Haley told me about the tour...

38:33.678 --> 38:35.339
I got mad at her.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.913
I told her that if she left with Chris...

38:39.583 --> 38:41.016
it was over.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.323
I didn't really mean it.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.118
She left anyway.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.896
Nathan.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.729
She's not coming back.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.627
What am I gonna do?

39:02.373 --> 39:03.601
Nathan.

39:05.576 --> 39:09.842
I know what it's like to have
the person you love walk away. Trust me.

39:11.782 --> 39:14.649
But I know Haley, and she's a good person.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.745
She'll do the right thing.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.820
You just have to have a little faith.

39:39.844 --> 39:43.644
Bob? It's Andy. I've got a job for you.

39:49.353 --> 39:52.618
<i>Call of the Wild.</i>
You know, I've had that since high school?

39:53.724 --> 39:56.249
I hope it's okay that I borrowed it.

39:56.394 --> 40:00.091
Please. It's nice to have someone around
who cares about literature.

40:02.266 --> 40:05.099
London's great. A man's author.

40:05.803 --> 40:07.498
Kill or be killed.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.133
That's the way of the world.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.106
You know...

40:13.344 --> 40:15.904
if you ever need any help
down at the dealership...

40:15.980 --> 40:18.676
I could come by after school some time.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.277
Thanks, son. I'd like that.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.965
-Hey, Mouth.
-Miss President.

40:35.599 --> 40:39.467
I know, it does have a nice ring to it,
doesn't it? But you know what?

40:39.970 --> 40:41.938
My friends just call me Brooke.

40:56.754 --> 40:58.051
You love it.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.724
<i>Hi, this is Haley.</i>
<i>I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

42:09.793 --> 42:11.658
<i>Leave a message and I will call you back.</i>

42:51.902 --> 42:52.891
