WEBVTT

00:27.861 --> 00:29.230
Ow!

00:29.263 --> 00:30.798
Oh! Sorry, mama!

00:30.831 --> 00:33.434
What are you doing in the
ocean? That's weird.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.802
Um, nothing.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.337
I was just thinking...

00:36.370 --> 00:39.073
about the one that got away.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.775
I'm thinking about the one
that got away, too.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.277
But it's not a fish.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.579
It's a girl.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.181
Terra!

00:47.215 --> 00:49.717
I thought you finally won her
over with that song.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.686
* Endless love,
one day you'll see

00:52.720 --> 00:55.589
* When I walk,
you'll walk with me, Terra

00:55.623 --> 00:58.826
* Together
let the light shine *

01:01.662 --> 01:03.331
Nice!

01:04.432 --> 01:05.566
Again!

01:05.599 --> 01:07.201
* You can't fade away

01:07.235 --> 01:08.236
* The way I feel for you

01:08.269 --> 01:10.171
* There ain't no word
that can say

01:10.204 --> 01:11.572
* You can't fade away

01:11.605 --> 01:12.673
* Can't fade away

01:12.706 --> 01:15.109
* You can't fade away
Can't fade away

01:15.143 --> 01:17.211
* Fade away
You can't fade away

01:17.245 --> 01:18.379
* The way I feel for...

01:18.412 --> 01:20.514
Ugh! I'm sick of that song!

01:20.548 --> 01:23.151
And I'm sick of us!
We're done!

01:23.184 --> 01:25.319
Yeah. That song was
really the only thing

01:25.353 --> 01:27.255
I was bringing
to the relationship.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.757
Now every time
I see a rock,

01:29.790 --> 01:30.791
I think of her!

01:30.824 --> 01:33.161
She used to crush me
with ones just like this!

01:33.194 --> 01:36.264
Get over it, already.
Terra tried to destroy
all of us.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.665
Twice.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.334
Then can you at least
crush me with this boulder?

01:40.368 --> 01:41.502
Sure.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.874
It's like she's still here!

01:46.907 --> 01:49.109
Thank you!

01:54.782 --> 01:57.318
So, anyway.
Terra, I just wanted to
say I love you,

01:57.351 --> 01:59.620
and that every moment
we're apart is complete agony!

01:59.653 --> 02:01.922
So, uh, call me back
when you get this!

02:01.955 --> 02:03.657
Love you.
I love you. Bye.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.627
You're being pathetic.
Stop calling her.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.429
Shh!
It's ringing!

02:18.806 --> 02:20.874
Terra!
What do you want?

02:20.908 --> 02:23.177
Oh, I know what she
wants, Robin.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.378
* You can't fade away

02:24.412 --> 02:25.479
-Stop!
-Ow!

02:25.513 --> 02:26.680
Stop it! Now!

02:26.714 --> 02:29.617
You've ruined that
beautiful song!

02:29.650 --> 02:32.520
What I want is for you
to leave me...

02:32.553 --> 02:34.855
alone.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.059
I've met someone.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.928
-See, she has a boyfriend.
Move on.
-I can't breathe.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.530
-I can't breathe.
-Thanks, Raven.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.466
Oh, I think you might
know him.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.439
That's a pirate!

02:54.375 --> 02:56.410
No, it's Aqualad.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.246
Yeah, it's me.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.413
Miss me, Raven?

03:01.315 --> 03:02.883
Dating my other girl now?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.518
Oh, it's on!

03:04.552 --> 03:06.620
I will chew you up again, bro!

03:06.654 --> 03:08.522
Relax, you little goblin.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.424
That's all in the past.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.726
Ooh! That is so the romantic!

03:12.760 --> 03:14.828
You two have nothing
in common!

03:14.862 --> 03:17.331
Yeah. He's about water,
she's about rocks.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.699
He's a hero.
She's a villain.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.601
He's a boy, she's a girl.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.803
Nothing in common!

03:22.836 --> 03:24.838
When you rejected me,
I was heartbroken.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.775
But seeing you now,
sad, alone and single,

03:27.808 --> 03:29.510
I know I dodged a bullet.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.879
Whoa, okay.
I am not single.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.548
Uh, Beast Boy and I are...
dating.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.485
-That's cool.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.952
Well, since we're all so
happy and in love,

03:38.986 --> 03:40.754
we should go
on a double date tonight.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.657
A couples' night out?
Then make it a triple date!

03:43.691 --> 03:46.294
Starfire and I
will be there too.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.595
All this romantic tension!

03:47.628 --> 03:49.497
Will we fall in love?
Won't we?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.764
-We will not...
-Nobody knows!

03:50.798 --> 03:52.766
And I'll be the
third wheel, baby!

03:52.800 --> 03:55.235
-Whoo!

03:56.904 --> 03:58.339
Whoo!

03:58.372 --> 04:00.308
CYBORG: Man, I love
being the third wheel!

04:00.341 --> 04:01.775
Taggin' along, bein' awkward,

04:01.809 --> 04:04.478
getting' in the way
of true romance!

04:04.512 --> 04:06.947
Hey! I am warning you,
third wheel,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.349
do not get between

04:08.382 --> 04:11.419
Star and me!

04:11.452 --> 04:15.489
Phew! Can something
get between your
bad breath and my nostrils?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.890
No wonder he does not get

04:16.924 --> 04:19.293
the smoochie-smoochies
on his mouth hole!

04:19.327 --> 04:20.328
Argh!

04:21.629 --> 04:22.963
Ha!
Pshh.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.798
You were telling me
to get over Terra,

04:24.832 --> 04:28.336
and you still wanna do the
smoochie-smoochies...

04:28.369 --> 04:30.538
with Fish-Face.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.940
Well, maybe I made
a mistake dumping him.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.508
Well, I'm glad you did,
though,

04:34.542 --> 04:36.009
'cause I got a date out of it.

04:36.043 --> 04:39.380
It's a fake date. We're just
trying to make them jealous.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.748
Ooh, that's dirty!

04:40.781 --> 04:43.517
I like your style, mama!
Come here!

04:59.900 --> 05:02.403
Mmm.
Candlelight.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.937
Cloth napkins.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.406
Multiple forks.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.640
The setting is so...

05:06.674 --> 05:07.708
Romantic!

05:07.741 --> 05:09.410
Wouldn't you say, Star?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.811
Indeed.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.547
That is why we should sit at
the table with Cyborg.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.616
-Hey!

05:16.116 --> 05:17.751
Over here!

05:18.719 --> 05:20.788
I got a booth!

05:25.626 --> 05:28.462
-Your makeup looks
great today.
-Oh, yeah... thanks.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.731
-You're a beautiful
young lady!
-Wow.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.866
You, um, look...
nice.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.404
BEAST BOY: And I am
enjoying the color of your...
RAVEN: Yes. Uh-huh.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.506
BEAST BOY: Wow!
Look at your feet!
RAVEN: And your hair!

05:38.539 --> 05:40.641
BEAST BOY: They're so cute!
RAVEN: You're so hairy!

05:40.674 --> 05:42.676
-Oh, I love your eyes.
-Thank you.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.845
And your cloak matches
your hair perfectly.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.146
I like you. A lot.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.549
Why, thank you.

05:48.582 --> 05:52.453
BEAST BOY: Maybe we should
hug, or kiss, sometime.
RAVEN: Yeah, go around.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.721
BEAST BOY: Mwah! Rawr! Y'arr.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.888
RAVEN: Ooh. Mwah.

05:58.592 --> 06:02.696
BEAST BOY:
I'll eat you up. Yum.
RAVEN: Mmm.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.633
RAVEN: I...
more than like being with you.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.869
Oh, so sorry.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.004
It's hard to contain our love.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.140
By the way,
I ordered for the table.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.977
Ooh, I love calamari!

06:18.178 --> 06:21.014
I know what you're doing.
And I love it!

06:21.048 --> 06:22.650
So good!

06:23.951 --> 06:26.186
Mr. Belvedere

06:26.219 --> 06:27.788
It is!

06:27.821 --> 06:31.024
You're eating the squid that
raised me as a child!

06:31.992 --> 06:34.928
Before him, no one cared!

06:34.962 --> 06:36.930
How could you, Terra?

06:37.898 --> 06:41.602
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to hurt you!

06:41.635 --> 06:43.403
I bet he was a good man.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.808
He would have liked you,
Terra.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.544
Would you look at the time?

06:50.578 --> 06:51.745
It's make-out-o'-clock.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.681
Thanks for dinner.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.683
Wow.
They really love each other.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.687
Yeah. We're gonna
have to work even harder
to break them up.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.195
Oh, my!

07:08.228 --> 07:10.498
Ha, I think I ordered
too much spaghetti.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.466
Uh, I might need
some help, Star.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.941
Ack!

07:22.075 --> 07:24.177
Third wheel!

07:24.211 --> 07:25.445
Whoo!

07:27.715 --> 07:28.882
Whoo!

07:53.574 --> 07:56.710
If you didn't like the song,
you could've just said so.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.845
It wasn't...

07:57.878 --> 07:59.079
Unbelievable!

08:14.862 --> 08:16.730
I'm not a fish, Aqualad,

08:16.764 --> 08:19.567
and you can't
make me into one!

08:19.600 --> 08:23.036
Terra, wait!
You're beautiful
without gills!

08:25.172 --> 08:27.507
-RAVEN: That's pretty funny.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.278
Nice day.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.913
Do you have to talk?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.656
BOTH:
That's it! It's over!

08:45.325 --> 08:46.760
Enjoy your fish!

08:46.794 --> 08:48.295
Fishface McFish!

08:48.328 --> 08:49.797
At least my fish

08:49.830 --> 08:52.065
don't have hearts of stone!

08:52.099 --> 08:54.167
AQUALAD: Stoneface...

09:06.747 --> 09:07.881
Woah! Woah!
Woah!

09:07.915 --> 09:09.316
What are you doing?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.284
I was just doing what
you were doing!

09:11.318 --> 09:12.419
What was I doing?

09:12.452 --> 09:15.623
I don't know!
But it was being done
on my face!

09:15.656 --> 09:16.790
Beast Boy!

09:16.824 --> 09:18.291
Don't hurt me!

09:21.662 --> 09:22.863
That was kinda nice.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.298
Really?

09:25.332 --> 09:26.900
-We should've known.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.335
Guys, not a good time.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.107
-You've caused us
a lot of pain.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.076
Now, we're gonna
return the favor.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.812
By crushing you with rocks!

09:38.846 --> 09:40.814
Rocks? Why can't
we summon some sharks?

09:40.848 --> 09:43.350
Look, I know we're going
through a tough time,

09:43.383 --> 09:45.853
but I've hated the Titans
way longer than you have.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.821
-Let me have this!

09:51.859 --> 09:53.627
I'm beginning to think
hating them

09:53.661 --> 09:55.696
is all we had in common
in the first place.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.231
How about,
you smash them with rocks,
I'll throw some sharks,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.668
and we agree to see
other people.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.235
Whatever.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.254
Not the trash hole again!

10:29.930 --> 10:31.699
So...

10:31.732 --> 10:33.100
What were we talking about?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.902
I don't remember.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.075
-CYBORG: Whoo!
-Cyborg!

10:43.744 --> 10:45.746
Nothin'!
Just third wheelin'
around town.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.016
You know me.
Ruinin' any chance
for romance!

10:49.049 --> 10:50.283
Sounds like fun!

10:52.720 --> 10:54.722
CYBORG: Whoo!
