It's been a good year for us.
It's been a monster year for us.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.090
A record-breaking,
history-making year for us.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.010
But that don't mean
it's been a satisfactory year for us.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.094

01:34.177 --> 01:36.888
Satisfaction, it's like gonorrhea.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.223
- Can I get an "amen"?
- Amen.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.850
- How about a "mazel"?
- Mazel.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.436
- Absolutely, Roy.
- Hey. Hey, fellas.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.521
Somebody order a pizza?

01:44.604 --> 01:47.190
- Jackie Moreno.
- I come bearing gifts.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.443
- It's an honor to meet you, man.
- The Jack Moreno.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.445
Holy shit, I gotta shake your hand.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.071
No, no, no. Stay.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.823
Stay. Learn something.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.869
Half the gold records on my wall,
Jackie had a part in delivering.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.495
Yeah, some of the platinum ones, too.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.289
But who's counting?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.625
So, Jackie. What's new?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.835
I found a girl singer, Roy.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.130
She's pure disco. Face like an angel.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.965
Body, boom, boom, boom.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.384
- I have to record a demo immediately.
- A demo?

02:14.468 --> 02:18.430
This girl's gonna make somebody
armored trucks full of cash.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.223
Considering our history...

02:20.724 --> 02:22.267
you know, I'm coming to you first.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.435
Okay.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.395
- Do it.
- For real?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.273
- If you believe in her, why not? Right?
- Thank you. Wow!

02:28.357 --> 02:32.819
But hey, listen, I can't do it
on the "el cheapo." You know?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.696
She's a disco act. I gotta have musicians.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.199
I gotta have studio time.
I need the right engineer.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.118
- Seed money.
- Seed money?

02:40.202 --> 02:41.578
At least five grand.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.038
Hey, how about this?

02:43.121 --> 02:45.457
How about... five cents?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.585
I'm being serious, Roy.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.544
So am I.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.756
See this, boys?
This is what you never fucking wanna be.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.049
Yo, Jackie.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.592
Go fuck yourself.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.803
Come on, man. I... I did a lot for you.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.805
And I for you. Tell you what.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.057
You remorseless, degenerate junkie,

03:02.140 --> 03:04.643
gambling fuckhead,
thieving waste of space.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.687
Go find anybody in the record business
who will work with you again

03:07.771 --> 03:09.106
and then come back and talk to me!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.525
But nobody will because you're dead,
Jackie.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.485
You're a... You're a ghost.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.736
And you deserve it.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.531
Because you, you are the royal flush

03:17.614 --> 03:20.951
of pathetic loser,
swindling, junkie fucks!

03:21.034 --> 03:24.037
"Pure disco"? Forget it.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.288
Go die.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.461
<i>A record-breaking heat wave continues</i>

03:31.545 --> 03:33.338
<i>- with a daytime high...</i>
- I mean, I hear you.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.717
But there's always options.
You just gotta know where to look.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.218
I am looking, and I'm telling you,

03:38.301 --> 03:40.220
- it ain't easy.
- Nothing in life easy.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.097
Ain't no peaches and cream.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.517
- Ezekiel's looking for some work.
- Hold up now. Stop the damn presses.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.478
You mean to tell me,
Mr. Phyllis Wheatley over here,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.272
that your poetry ain't making good money?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.023
I'm trying to raise money for a turntable.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.317
What the hell you need to buy
a damn turntable for?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.153
How about save up
for some damn toothpaste?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.530
Leon, he's trying to find an honest job.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.450
Okay. Well, now that,
I can support 110 percent.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.368
And I think you should bring him with you.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.454
And to that, I say:

04:05.954 --> 04:07.330
Hell, no.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.333
The last thing I need
is that boy mess up my money.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.669
I think it's a great way for him
to learn about hard work.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.921
You said you was gonna make
a man out of me this summer.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.757
- Oh, that's just a figure of speech.
- Yeah, and you always say:

04:17.841 --> 04:19.718
"A man need to take initiative."

04:20.260 --> 04:21.678
What do you think he's doing?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.224
- Damn it. I do say that, don't I?
- Mm-hm.

04:27.934 --> 04:28.769
All right.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.981
But half your wages kick back to me.
You dig?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.692
Now, I gotta meet this man, Little Wolf,

04:35.776 --> 04:38.487
about some handyman gig
down at the Les Inferno.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.406
- That place got shot the hell up. So...
- Wait. Les Inferno?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.576
Oh, wait. So, what? Now you reneging?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.495
Huh? Oh, what?
Handyman work ain't good enough?

04:46.578 --> 04:48.663
- No, no, no. I just didn't...
- Yeah. Sure enough.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.666

whether you like it or not.

Come on. Let me see you put some
elbow grease into it, cupcake.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.976

- I just need the money.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.269
Don't we all.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.481
I know my cousin
didn't hire you to be sitting here,

05:14.564 --> 05:17.734

05:17.859 --> 05:19.820

- Got here at 5:00 a.m.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.321

05:24.241 --> 05:26.952
No, sir.
But we don't get paid by the hour anyway.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.954
- It's a flat rate.
- Yeah?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.915
- Well, now, it's a "you're fired" rate.
- What?

05:31.998 --> 05:34.793
- The fuck out of here.
- Is he serious?

05:34.876 --> 05:37.295
- Pack it up.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.174

What's her phone number?

05:44.844 --> 05:46.137
Come on. Give up them digits.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.305
She ain't got a phone.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.476
- Who the fuck you eyeballing?
- We worked five hours.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.770

All right, kids. You know the drill.
No fighting. Mind your manners.

No biting, no strangers

So far, $1.12.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.734
Leave no stone unturned.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.987
- And turntables?
- I fixed the burnt ones.

- Yo, hope your ass brought some money.
- Yeah, yeah. Uh...

08:43.148 --> 08:47.569
This is my life savings right here:
31 dollars and 18 cents.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.864
- Hey, you heard from Shao?
- Let's just get the gear.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.367
So, with Zeke's savings added up

09:02.417 --> 09:03.543
What's up?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.171

- Why?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.130
Just close your eyes.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.637
Open them.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.392
I didn't wrap it, but it's yours.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.520
It's for your poems
for when your old book is done.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.522
And it's got your initials.

09:25.857 --> 09:29.652
I got it to say thank you for helping me
with my song at the church.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.116
- We were great, right?
- Yeah.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.534
We was all right.

09:39.954 --> 09:40.955
Thanks.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.207

And all I can hear from you is protocol,
decorum, diplomacy, patience.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.725
- Delicacy.
- <i>Jefe</i>.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.352
- Stan.
- There are people to please.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.647
I'm happy to meet the guy.
But unless I'm meeting with the main guy,

10:05.730 --> 10:07.565
they come here to me!
I don't go to them.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.985
As it happens, here's my next meeting.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.487
<i>Stan, para fuera.</i>

10:14.531 --> 10:15.740
My man.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.284
I'm dying to hear...

10:20.245 --> 10:22.914
how this meeting went
with this Asheton guy.

10:22.997 --> 10:27.001
Well, he wants to cut a demo
with Mylene immediately.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.002
What?

10:28.920 --> 10:29.879
He don't wanna meet her?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.673
- He don't wanna hear her sing?
- No.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.049
Hold up.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.387
This is great news, Jackie,
but are you sure that's what he said?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.849
Hm? Because I did some looking
into this Asheton guy and...

10:40.932 --> 10:45.395
he's a serious dude.
And Marrakesh Star is a serious label.

10:46.437 --> 10:50.066
Uh, look, Cisco, I...
I know where you're going, and um...

10:51.526 --> 10:52.944
I'm not offended.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.280
Jackie, I'm just saying...

10:56.156 --> 10:58.241
you don't have to be afraid
to tell the truth.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.659
The truth?
Okay, the truth is this:

10:59.742 --> 11:03.121
Here in the Bronx, around the card table,
everybody knows that I know people,

11:03.204 --> 11:04.289
that I make records.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.876
You know, I don't go around and advertise
myself like a jerk off, you know?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.296
Once in a while, maybe,
but you know, down in Manhattan, Cisco,

11:11.379 --> 11:13.590
on 6th Avenue, in the record business?

11:14.382 --> 11:17.302
People get in line to cut a demo
on my say-so.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.554
- That's good to hear.
- It is what it is.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.098
Okay,
so when do I get to meet with Roy Asheton?

11:22.181 --> 11:23.808
When do you get to meet Roy Asheton?

11:23.892 --> 11:26.477
Let tell you something
about Mr. Roy Asheton.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.146
- Fuck Roy Asheton.
<i>- ?Qué tú 'tá hablando, tipo?</i>

11:28.479 --> 11:29.981
- You just finished saying...
- Yeah, yeah.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.941
Of course he wants to record Mylene.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.319
- Of course he wants to sign her.
- So, what's the problem?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.695
The problem is you're my friend.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.699
The problem is, in all honesty,
Mylene is a big-time talent.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.367
And she looks like a good, decent girl.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.495
She is a good, decent girl,
but I ain't following you.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.374
Roy Asheton is the Grand Poobah
of the record business

11:48.458 --> 11:51.544
because he makes
a gazillion dollars a year

11:51.628 --> 11:54.464
screwing over every artist that he signs.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.007
So, we get a... hire a lawyer.

11:56.090 --> 12:00.303
- We hire a music lawyer.
- He owns the lawyers. They all do.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.515
Look, I would love to get my debt
to you off my plate,

12:04.599 --> 12:07.352
but I'm not gonna do it
by fucking you over, you know?

12:07.435 --> 12:10.355
And the kid, Mylene,
I can't do that. I can't do that.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.649
<i>Que se joda</i> Roy Asheton then.
We go to another label.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.609
No, you don't get it.
They're all the same.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.695
The artists sign a standard contract
to record a demo.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.280
The record company owns it.

12:19.364 --> 12:23.034
If it pans out,
they sign the act to a lowball contract

12:23.117 --> 12:25.370
and fuck every hit
they can get out of them and,

12:25.453 --> 12:28.873
you know, and discard them
the minute they drop out of the Top 40.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.208
It's... It's all set up.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.501
It's just a rigged game.

12:32.126 --> 12:36.214
The only good thing about Roy
is that he's got the juice to make stars.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.883
But what's the point if he owns it all?

12:38.967 --> 12:41.219
I'm only being honest with you, Cisco,

12:41.302 --> 12:42.929
because out of respect for you.

12:43.346 --> 12:46.766
- And because your niece.
<i>- Espera, espera, espera.</i>

12:48.559 --> 12:51.688
So, how about... we record our own demo?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.774
You think you're the first guy
to have that idea?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.402
No, no, listen. We record our own demo.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.155
You work your magic.
You make Mylene great.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.074
And then we sell it to Asheton.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.285
And we negotiate Mylene's contract
from a position of strength.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.997
We go to this Roy like...
like players, not paupers.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.206
This is expensive.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.916
There's no guarantees either.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.002
How much?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.212
To do it right, 30, 40 grand.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.222
You come back in an hour.

13:27.098 --> 13:30.643
Lopez is gonna have 40 large
in a brown paper bag.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.729
But this demo? I own it.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.857
All of it.
And her contract too, if we get to sign.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.568
And like you say, if this all pans out...

13:39.694 --> 13:42.655
well then, of course, you get a taste.
<i>Claro que sí.</i>

13:44.115 --> 13:45.908
My niece means everything to me.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.785
Don't fuck this up, Jackito.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.414
<i>d Hot stuff d</i>

13:53.291 --> 13:57.378
<i>New York City has</i>
<i>the highest unemployment rate in America.</i>

14:02.008 --> 14:06.179
<i>d The music is mighty, mighty fine d</i>

14:08.056 --> 14:11.142
Look, we take our $51,
and we leverage it. Right?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.770
Convince Larry
to put us on a payment plan.

14:13.853 --> 14:19.025
All right?
Ten percent down, $51 becomes $510.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.361
And what we gotta avoid though,
is predatory lending.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.905
- 'Cause predatory lending...
- I have no idea what you're saying.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.075
- No.
- I'm saying, if we play our cards right,

14:27.158 --> 14:28.951
we walk out of here with mixers,
turntables,

14:29.035 --> 14:31.496
- maybe even speakers.
- I'm gonna wait inside, y'all.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.081
"Inside" as in "outside"?

14:33.164 --> 14:34.791
Shit. In this heat?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.293
Yo, is it just me today, or is it like...

14:38.211 --> 14:40.505
the Bronx is getting closer to the sun?

14:41.589 --> 14:43.174
How can I help you guys?

14:43.257 --> 14:47.011
Certainly. We're after that Clubman
1-1 mixer right there in the window.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.054
And the turntable.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.599
- My good man, about your payment plans...
- I gotta stop you right there.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.937
For you guys, unfortunately, everything up
in the front window is full-sticker price,

14:56.020 --> 14:57.188
or I can't help you.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.607
- No, your sign says...
- Yeah. It says "easy credit."

14:59.690 --> 15:03.027
It doesn't say "let me bend over,
so you could easily fuck me," right?

15:03.111 --> 15:06.072
- Excuse me?
- Look, you guys seem like nice kids,

15:06.155 --> 15:09.325
but I got a business to run here.
And for the last six months,

15:09.409 --> 15:12.453
boys who look like you have been
coming in here every day, saying:

15:12.537 --> 15:15.832
"Larry, Larry, hook me up
with your payment plan," you know?

15:15.915 --> 15:16.958
And you know what they want?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.127
They want two turntables and a mixer.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.421
Which is weird, right?
And they're crying all the time,

15:21.504 --> 15:23.089
saying, you know, they need it.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.341
You know, and they all
have this look in their eyes.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.137
- Like they're on some kind of drug thing.
- We are not gonna screw you. Come on.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.805
You know what? The other day...

15:31.556 --> 15:34.851
some guy comes in here, all right?
He's ten weeks behind on his payments.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.227
He hands me a cassette tape.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.897
He says, "Look, it's worth $100.
It's rare. It's dangerous to own."

15:39.981 --> 15:42.984
Dangerous? It's a fucking cassette tape.
So, I listen to it, right?

15:43.067 --> 15:43.943
It's garbage.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.154
No one's singing. There's nothing there.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.282
It's boom, boom, scratching.
Boom, boom, scratching, scratching.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.033
Over and over and over.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.869
Look. We'll...
We'll pay you $10 for it.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.245
Sold.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.957
There you go. You come in here,
you want something, you show me the money,

15:58.040 --> 16:00.751
I sell it to you.
You know, just don't fuck me.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.300
Clarence.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.594
Have you located that boy Napoleon yet?

16:10.178 --> 16:12.346
Little spic motherfucker knows our hitman.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.932
Ma, he's hiding out in Poughkeepsie.
I got my people on it.

16:15.016 --> 16:18.019
- Well, don't keep me waiting.
- I'm on it. Shit's done.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.730
Why this faggot here, Ma?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.316
Shaolin here's joining the family.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.734
Put him to work.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.444
Let him prove himself.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.529
Make me proud. Both of you.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.412
You boys play nice.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.791
It's hot as hell this morning, huh?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.128
Step to me wrong once, I'll kill you.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.172
Tell a soul what you doing with my mom,

16:46.255 --> 16:47.215
I'll kill you.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.884
Breathe in my general direction,
I'll kill you with pleasure.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.969
Understood?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.347
Just trying to make some cash, man.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.475
Is that a fact?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.061
Make this car disappear today.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.230
Do it right,
and there's $100 in it for you.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.358
Then maybe we can talk family business.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.736
Motherfucker.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.080
<i> Yo, we got a bootleg</i>
<i>Grandmaster Flash tape, dig?</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:21.832
<i>So, what if we put a little party on?</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:24.877
<i>Yeah, I'll be Boo Nasty, pretend to play
behind the wheels of steel.</i>

17:24.961 --> 17:26.963
<i>I don't know. Is all this safe?</i>

17:27.421 --> 17:30.591
<i>That bootlegger</i>
<i>did get stomped out at Flash's jam.</i>

17:30.675 --> 17:34.303
<i>We ain't bootlegged the tape.</i>
<i>We just gonna play it for a minute.</i>

17:34.387 --> 17:37.223
<i>Charge a cover at the door
and make some serious coin.</i>

17:37.306 --> 17:39.475
<i>Trust me. Flash will never find out.</i>

17:39.559 --> 17:43.604
- This could be the VIP area.
- Exclusive. I like it.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.899
Yeah, and we could serve Dizz's
Kool-Aid punch and charge extra.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.652
We gonna be making
major motherfucking ducats, boy.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.571
The thing about the punch is, um,

17:51.654 --> 17:55.116
I took my last tab of lysergic acid
diethylamide this morning, so...

17:55.199 --> 17:58.369
Dizz, not the acid punch.
The one you spike with Bacardi 151.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.996
Oh, okay. The special punch.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.497
First thing tomorrow morning,

18:01.581 --> 18:04.917
I wanna march into punk ass Larry's,
put the money on the counter,

18:05.001 --> 18:07.044
- make him count it.
- Real slow, baby.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.672
Walk out with one shiny turntable
and a mixer.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.382
Ra-Ra, Dizzee, Boo-Boo.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.968
What the hell is going on down here?

18:14.051 --> 18:17.638
Why the hell is all of Dad's stereo
equipment and records in the salon?

18:18.306 --> 18:19.807
You. Come here.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.604
- Come on, yo.
- We're just having a little party.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.024
Nuh-uh. Mom and Dad will kill you,
and then me and then you again.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.109
- We was taking about cutting you in.
- Yeah.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.694
We're charging at the door.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.780
I want $20.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.617
- Even if no one shows up.
- The people will come.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.577
'Cause we got the secret weapon.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.121
We got the Doomsday Machine.

- Oh!
- Damn, Mylene.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.107
You filling out Regina's dress
better than she do.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.277
- Shit, for real.
- What are they doing to this song?

20:36.861 --> 20:37.737
Ruining it.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.115
It sounds like a racket.
Yo, what happened to the singing part?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.373
Look at them diving on the floor and shit.
You can't even hustle to this.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.791
They're doing the freak now.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.710
It's just nasty.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.795
Nasty.

20:57.047 --> 20:57.965
Ew.

21:02.553 --> 21:06.557
That's right.
Show them how you freak it, girl.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.979
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

21:12.354 --> 21:13.481
Yeah, yeah.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.441
Uh, I'll be right back.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.323
<i>- </i><i> Grandmaster...</i>
<i>- </i><i> Boo Nasty!</i>

21:25.242 --> 21:27.036
- It's happening.
- What?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.829
I'm recording tonight.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.248
- Come with me. To Manhattan.
- Uh...

21:32.750 --> 21:35.503
Yeah, um, you know, maybe.
Depends how it goes here.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.129
No, fuck that. You coming.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.810
- Why do you want me there?
- Just so you could be there.

21:50.893 --> 21:54.063
You know?
It's at a fancy studio and stuff, and...

21:54.146 --> 21:56.607
- I'm nervous.
- Cool, but like...

21:56.941 --> 21:59.443
sometimes, you want me around,
sometimes, you don't, and...

21:59.527 --> 22:02.530
if you wasn't nervous to be going
there today, I mean, for real,

22:02.613 --> 22:03.989
would you even want me there at all?

22:04.073 --> 22:06.534
Guess you're gonna have to
come with me if you wanna find out.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.121
What the fuck is you doing with this?

22:12.623 --> 22:15.376
DJ faking the funk,
little midget fugazi motherfucker.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.460
This don't fly.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.256
And when shit don't fly,
the Caesars come party-crashing.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.301
Now, how y'all sound?
Pretending y'all Flash?

22:24.385 --> 22:25.469
Flash is our boy.

22:25.553 --> 22:26.845
Flash is your boy?

22:26.929 --> 22:28.055
And you do him like that?

22:28.138 --> 22:29.348
Take that cash.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.225
This who we are.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.728
We get money from Flash for making
sure niggas ain't doing this stupid shit.

22:34.812 --> 22:35.938
Yo, my man. Hey.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.648
We worked our asses off for that money,

22:37.731 --> 22:39.692
so, we can't be giving it up
without a fair one.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.280
How about I shoot him in the head,
and then we fight a fair one?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.991
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, never mind.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.993
Hey! Yo!

22:49.743 --> 22:51.245
Hey, that ain't necessary.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.914
And the next time we see you,

22:53.998 --> 22:56.542
I swear to God we gonna take you
to the top of that roof there,

22:56.625 --> 22:59.712

mutilate you, make you eat dog shit,

22:59.795 --> 23:01.338
and throw you off that fucking roof.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.924
And one more thing, and I guarantee.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.219
The Fantastic Four Plus One
are gonna be dead to the Grandmaster

23:07.303 --> 23:09.179

What the fuck are you still doing here?
You got but one thing to do today.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.963
- Dump the car.
- Hard at work, right?

23:43.047 --> 23:46.050
- Jack the Mick Spic Fuck.
- Clarence, ever heard of a fan?

23:46.133 --> 23:47.926

23:55.601 --> 23:58.395
Debts cleared.
I want two ounces, all right?

23:58.479 --> 23:59.813
None of that gutter glitter.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.315
I want the sugar.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.735
- The pure Kriss Kringle studio fuel.
- Try that.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.404
- All right.
- Yeah, man. Go to work.

24:08.697 --> 24:14.203
- Yo, how you come into all this cheddar?
- I got the... the next disco diva.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.289
- No shit.
- I'm recording her first single tonight.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.999
Jack the Mutt's doing disco.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.753
- What's this?
- It's called <i>Critters from Mars.</i>

24:22.878 --> 24:26.423
Between you and me, I don't know nothing
about writing no disco songs, man.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.010
Personally, I don't like that music.
It's got no fucking feeling.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.762
Hey, disco's all fucking feeling.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.972
There's tragic passion
sung by the unloved

24:34.056 --> 24:39.812
that fucking hypnotizes over chugging
funk-style grooves that just...

24:40.104 --> 24:41.480
That's some trippy shit, you know?

24:42.064 --> 24:45.526
Hey, you know, I got an associate that
dabbled in a little bit of songwriting.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.403
- Uh-huh.
- A cat over there at High Voltage.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.904
You know, the label I finance?

24:48.987 --> 24:50.364
Yeah. I know High Voltage.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.909
He got some of the big discos
that'll lick right off your candy ass.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.245
Yo, Clarence.
This is the big-time, all right?

24:56.328 --> 24:58.163
- This is the real deal.
- Come on, man.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.915
I'm the motherfucking king of disco.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.752
Oh, yeah? All right, yo.
Want me to check something out,

25:03.836 --> 25:05.170
- I'll check it out.
- Check the shit out.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.047
I'll look at it, man. I'll look for you.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.174
For you, all right?
And I'll tell you what I think.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.259
Check it out.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.512
It's a party anthem in a 4/4 beat.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.516
And it's called
"Boogie Oogie Disco Biscuit"?

25:17.599 --> 25:20.728
I know he'd appreciate the feedback.
So, what you think?

25:20.811 --> 25:22.521
Well, you know what?
It's a lot to take in.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.022
It's a lot to digest.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.067
<i>d Dance, dance, dance d</i>

25:28.318 --> 25:30.028
And Mom and Dad put me in charge.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.321
Look at it in here!

25:31.405 --> 25:33.323
How are we gonna fix all this in time?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.537
Yo, their parents are gonna
bug the fuck out for real.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.580
Yeah.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.878
Oh, shit. That Shaolin.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.796
You think he knows
what happened with Flash?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.174
I don't know. Just take it cool.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.134
- Yeah.
- Shaolin Fantastic back.

25:53.260 --> 25:56.013
Dang, homeboy.
That's some serious <i>Shaft</i> shit right here.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.890
Who that hunk?

25:58.223 --> 25:59.475
Take me to church now.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.269
This was formerly owned
by a DJ named "Malibu."

26:02.352 --> 26:03.896
But she's ours now. So, hop in, fellas.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.981
Come on, y'all. Hop in.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.733
What you doing here?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.777
I was passing by.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.447
Decided to stop in. See if y'all wanted
to hit the Jamaican joint.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.532
Get some new records. Spin the whip.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.452
- He's busy.
- This your girl?

26:18.535 --> 26:19.870
Didn't think so.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.080
That's the one
at Les Inferno that night, right?

26:22.164 --> 26:23.999
- Who are you?
- He's a friend, Mylene.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.126
- I told you about him.
- I'm Shaolin Fantastic.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.252
But you can call me Shao.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.004
Well, nice to meet you, Shao,

26:29.087 --> 26:31.089
but me and Zeke gotta get going now.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.592
"Mylene," right?

26:33.675 --> 26:36.595
Do you mind if I have a word
with my wordsmith before y'all jet?

26:37.304 --> 26:40.516
Just talk about some business.
Music business.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.976
Sure, but, you know,
I got music business, too.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.354
- The wack part.
- Excuse me?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.606
- That's what you do. You sing, right?
- Yeah.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.025
That's what we call the wack part.
Wackness. Bullshit.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.777
- Right, Books?
- "Books"?

26:51.860 --> 26:54.029
Yeah. That's his street name
'cause he's smart as hell.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.324
Hold up, hold up.
Mylene, give us a minute, all right?

26:58.826 --> 27:01.328
Yo, are we gonna tell Shao
what happened with the Flash tape?

27:01.411 --> 27:02.913
Nah, let's play it cool.

27:02.996 --> 27:06.542
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm sorry for my absence, man.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.462
Whatever happened to "if you ever see
me again, cross the street"?

27:10.921 --> 27:13.006
That fire had me shook up.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.801
Brought back some, uh...

27:16.426 --> 27:19.054
- some memories. Some bad ones.
- I could understand that.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.974
It's all good, though. I'm back at it now.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.684
And I got some cash coming in.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.603
Enough to get a new system.
Maybe even before the end of the day.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.398
We'll be back in business
before you know it.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.484
- Rocking the rhymes. Clocking the beat.
- Yo, Ezekiel!

27:32.568 --> 27:34.069
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.947
- What's with Malibu's car?
- All right, look.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.449
- Cadillac's paying me to dump it.
- Fuck that motherfucker.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.534
I know. I know, I know.

27:41.410 --> 27:44.705
But it's good money.
We dump it come nightfall, we get paid.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.207
Meantime, we got a whip to joyride,

27:47.291 --> 27:50.711
records to buy
and some dope-ass weed to smoke.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.046
My treat.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.757
- Zeke.
- Yo, what are we waiting for?

27:55.841 --> 27:58.218
- Don't wanna come between...
- She's not my girl.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.761
- Look, I'm leaving. Okay?
- No.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.847
- Stay here with your friends.
- I'll go with you.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.099
No, it's fine. I'm fine on my own, okay?

28:04.182 --> 28:05.684
- Wait.
- What?

28:08.437 --> 28:09.271
Good luck.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.610
- Whatever.
- Let's go, man. Come on.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.570
Let's take this baby for a ride.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.779
Women, huh?

28:18.739 --> 28:21.491
Fuck them. Let's boogie.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.994
Ya'll gonna leave me here
to clean all this up?

28:39.718 --> 28:42.429
- You're asking her to play you.
- Nah.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.224
"Nah," what?

28:46.141 --> 28:49.102
- I know how to play the game.
- See, that's your problem.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.189
That's your problem.
Players always get played at the end.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.358
Whereas Shaolin Fantastic...

28:54.441 --> 28:56.276
...he is the game.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.820
- You dig me? He is the game.
- Yeah, I dig.

<i>But my nerves betray me</i>

29:21.635 --> 29:24.346
<i>You see, up in the Bronx

29:26.056 --> 29:27.474
<i>And right seem wrong</i>

<i>We're expecting record-temperature highs.</i>

<i>The city's never seen anything like this.

<i>Severe thunderstorm warnings,</i>

<i>Be advised.</i>

29:46.410 --> 29:49.579
So, this is a professional
recording studio.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.748
The guy back in the booth there,
the fat guy,

29:51.832 --> 29:53.875
that's Furry Cooperstein, our engineer.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.796
And the... You ready, you ready?
You ready to do one?

29:57.879 --> 29:58.714
Yeah.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.300
- Okay.
- Okay, we're, uh...

30:01.675 --> 30:03.385
Here's the tune.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.056
- "Oogie Boogie Disco Biscuit."
- It's a party anthem.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.727
In a 4/4 beat, but with subtext.
I wrote it.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.479
All the big discos,
they're eating this shit up.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.523
I won't let you down, Mr. Moreno.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.400
All right. We're ready to go.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.444
You're gonna be great.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.904
It's gonna be great.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.746
I warned you last month,
with all of the plans we have in play,

30:30.829 --> 30:33.749
<i>Hijos Boricuas</i> has to run
like a squeaky-clean operation.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.209
<i>- Pero... Pero...
- Pero, pero deja con el fucking pero, ya.</i>

30:36.293 --> 30:38.170

30:38.378 --> 30:39.963
<i>Para fuera con eso.</i>

30:40.047 --> 30:42.758
You get rid of it,
or I'm gonna get rid of you.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.388
Lydia.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.392
I'm sorry you had to even see all of that.

30:53.894 --> 30:55.187
I'm not.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.439
Only reminds me who you are.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.325
- I don't drink.
- I know. It's ginger ale.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.328
Hey, come on.
It's hot out there tonight.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.663

31:23.131 --> 31:26.051
- It looks nice.
- My home is destroyed.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.511
My daughter's gone.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.223
The church is scandalized,
her baby sister weeps.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.559
My husband, your brother,
speaks of taking his own life,

31:34.643 --> 31:37.145
- and I'm ready to join him.
- Okay, okay.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.331

31:56.790 --> 32:00.460
<i>d Touch my booty

32:00.585 --> 32:03.588
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Hold for a second. Hold.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.090
<i>d Disco bis... d</i>

32:05.173 --> 32:08.093
Mylene, dear, "hold" means stop singing.

32:09.511 --> 32:10.679
Listen, um...

32:12.722 --> 32:15.392
- Let's do another take, Furry.
- Yeah, two questions, Jackie.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.936
How high are you,
and where's my fucking money?

32:18.019 --> 32:19.479
Whoa, excuse me?

32:19.563 --> 32:21.064
Mr. Moreno?

32:22.149 --> 32:24.276
- Mr. Moreno?
- Yes, dear?

32:24.359 --> 32:25.444
This isn't working.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.780
- It's working great.
- No, this isn't my type of song.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.575
It... Because you're not singing it right.
It's...

32:31.658 --> 32:33.034
Furry, tell her.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.411
The song fucking sucks, dude.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.790
Mylene, do you know
what a disco biscuit is?

32:39.458 --> 32:40.375
Like a cookie?

32:41.835 --> 32:43.128
No, it...

32:43.503 --> 32:46.131
No, it's a Quaalude.
It's a... It's a popular drug.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.050
It makes the user feel mellow and horny.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.345
Like, just... You know what "horny" means?
You know...? You know what "horny" is?

32:52.554 --> 32:53.763
Um...

32:53.847 --> 32:55.140
Yeah.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.851
But this song don't make me
feel like that.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.565
- Well, how...? How does it make you feel?
- Makes me feel stupid.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.984
Like, a comedy, but not funny.

33:06.067 --> 33:09.988
You know, like... Like wack.
Like a joke. Like "Disco Duck."

33:12.407 --> 33:14.784
Man, I can't wait to see
the look on Larry's face

33:14.868 --> 33:16.828
when we roll in
for that Clubman 1-1.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.039
We gotta push this
over here first. Come on.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.624
- Go, go.
- Come on.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.167
- Hold up. Stop.
- No.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.336
He almost forgot the pinewood speakers.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.254
- What?
- Pop the trunk.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.507
Yo, who was supposed to be
checking that shit?

33:28.590 --> 33:30.383
You need that shit for the get-down.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.594
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.014
- Motherfucker.
- What the fuck?

33:36.097 --> 33:38.433
That's the little hard-rock motherfucker
from the block.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.061
Motherfucker. Fucking Cadillac, man.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.980
This is messed up.
Yo, Shao. Why you put us in this shit?

33:44.064 --> 33:46.358
- I didn't do nothing.
- I don't know nothing about this.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.984
- That nigga dead.
- Let's go.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.362
- Boo-Boo, Dizz, Zeke, let's go.
- No.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.989
- No? What you mean "no"?
- No. Just no. No.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.324
Ain't nobody going.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.868
- I'm gonna fuck you up.
- Shao didn't know, right?

33:57.244 --> 33:58.495
Close that shit.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.541
That body turns up anywhere
but on the inside of that trunk...

34:03.166 --> 34:06.336
Cadillac gonna make sure we all
gonna be the next ones stuffed in there.

34:06.419 --> 34:10.047
The cops find it? Gonna lock us up
regardless whether we did shit or not.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.424
Make sure you got everything,

34:11.507 --> 34:14.844
that you didn't leave your bus pass
with your name on it. Let's go.

34:17.681 --> 34:18.974
How can I help?

34:19.933 --> 34:22.518
Please... I beg of you...

34:23.018 --> 34:24.145
get out of our lives.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.938
- Lydia.
- No.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.065
You don't need us.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.985
You cling to us
because you have no one for yourself.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.860
You're no spring chicken, Franny.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.116
It's time for you to make your own family.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.118
Stop with the girlfriends.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.786
Find yourself a real woman.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.291
I got a real woman. I'm waiting on her.

34:44.373 --> 34:47.460
<i>Pero</i>, she's stubborn.
But me, hey, I'm loyal.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.004
<i>Eso la verdad.</i>

34:56.636 --> 34:58.388
I need Mylene to come back home.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.474
Bring my daughter home
before there's no home left for her.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.561
Whoa, I... I think you
overestimate my powers.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.731
Mylene, she's her own person,
and all she wants to do is sing.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.190
Because of you.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.444
Yeah. Mylene came to see you
for all of this.

35:13.361 --> 35:16.114
Her hair smelled <i>como tu cigarros sucio.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:19.034
And that awful dress. That was you.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.994
And the man in the church,
the record producer...

35:21.077 --> 35:23.705
She wants to sing!
And you... You're suffocating her.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.379
She's my niece...

35:32.047 --> 35:33.548
and I love her.

35:34.924 --> 35:38.011
And my brother, he's... he's crazy.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.179
And you, you...

35:39.971 --> 35:42.390
You've become like a... a slave.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.560
And between the two of you, you're...

35:46.186 --> 35:49.731
you're killing Mylene's soul.
You're killing her...

35:50.857 --> 35:51.983
Hey.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.653
<i>Suéltame.</i>

35:55.320 --> 35:56.780
- <i>Cálmate, cálmate.</i>
- Let go.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.782
- Lydia, please.
- Let go.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.368
<i>Cálmate. Cálmate.</i>

36:15.173 --> 36:18.802
She's right, Jackie.
The song, it's beneath you and her.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.011
Oh, the song's beneath me?

36:20.095 --> 36:21.680
- It's beneath me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.973
The song is benea... It's beneath me, huh?

36:24.224 --> 36:25.809
- It's beneath me.
- Hey, man.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.310
- Would you take it easy?
- Take it easy.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.687
Take it easy. What do you mean?

36:28.770 --> 36:31.106
Know what I got?
I owe fi... I owe five shylocks.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.150
I owe wiseguys. Street gangs.

36:34.234 --> 36:38.822
I got whiplash in my head from...
from spinning my head all day,

36:38.905 --> 36:41.908
thinking I'm gonna get whacked.
"Take it easy." How about some civility?

36:42.534 --> 36:46.246
What do I gotta do to be met with...
with some civility?

36:47.372 --> 36:49.040
What do I gotta do, huh?

36:49.124 --> 36:52.919
What do I have to do
to meet with some civility?

36:53.002 --> 36:54.796
Fucking pisses me off!

36:54.879 --> 36:58.049
So, how about that, huh?
Civility! Civility!

36:58.133 --> 36:59.718
- Civility!
- Jackie...

37:02.053 --> 37:05.098
Come on. Come on!
Push. Come on!

37:06.224 --> 37:07.142
Go. Let go. Let go.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.111
Fantastic Four Plus One is done.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.741
We're starting over.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.161
From now on,
whatever goes down, we go down together.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.372
That's how it gonna go down
in the get-down. That's how it gotta be.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.791
If one man fall, we all fall.
Like how they say:

37:31.875 --> 37:34.586
"You gotta stand for something,
or you'll fall for anything."

37:35.503 --> 37:36.629
We're brothers now.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.717
We're the Get-Down Brothers.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.554
We gotta get ours.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.181
Do or die.

37:47.557 --> 37:51.102
First chance we get...
Cadillac's going down.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.458
Know what that means?
Know what civility means?

38:13.541 --> 38:16.419
This is what it means.
Civility, civil...

38:16.503 --> 38:19.130
All right, what happened?
Where's the coke?

38:20.590 --> 38:21.674
Oh, shit.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.551
Where'd Manhattan go?

38:29.933 --> 38:32.519
<i>A major blackout</i>
<i>has struck New York City.</i>

38:32.602 --> 38:35.230
<i>Ian Wallace of ConEd is standing by.</i>

38:35.313 --> 38:39.150
<i>Ian, this looks to be one of the worst
power outages this city has ever seen.</i>

38:39.234 --> 38:42.403
<i>Look, we're experiencing</i>
<i>severe lightning storms.</i>

38:42.487 --> 38:45.156
<i>That lightning took out power lines
leading to the main generator,</i>

38:45.240 --> 38:46.783
<i>and the grid just couldn't handle it.</i>

38:46.866 --> 38:48.868
Where were you when
the lights went out?

38:48.952 --> 38:53.039
When the lights went out, I was in
the movies, and it suddenly blacked out.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.709
<i>At 9:34 pm, a complete</i>
<i>power shutdown occurred.</i>

38:56.793 --> 38:59.546
<i>Any idea when the power will be restored?</i>

38:59.629 --> 39:01.589
<i>Just how long it will take</i>
<i>to restore power,</i>

39:01.673 --> 39:03.842
<i>we simply cannot determine at this time.</i>

39:04.217 --> 39:06.219
<i>We go to the streets for more on this.</i>

39:07.262 --> 39:12.058
It is 'cause I messed up the song?
Why you went all crazy like a maniac?

39:12.141 --> 39:13.977
No. Not at all.

39:14.060 --> 39:17.772
Okay, but... you do think
I'm talented, right, Mr. Moreno?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.399
You're very talented.

39:19.482 --> 39:24.279
Yeah, but do you think I'm talented
enough to be a star, like, for real?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.614
How about you tell me.
Do you think you're talented?

39:27.448 --> 39:30.743
- Mm... I don't know.
- "I don't know" is for amateurs.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.371
- You either know or you don't.
- Okay, but what's your opinion?

39:33.788 --> 39:35.123
That's my opinion.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.667
What's your professional opinion?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.586
- My professional opinion? Well...
- Yeah.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.296
Oh, Mylene...

39:42.297 --> 39:47.010
It's time you know what everybody
below 59th Street knows, which is this:

39:47.135 --> 39:50.013
Nobody gives a fuck about
my professional opinion, you know?

39:50.096 --> 39:53.600
And even if they did, in order for me
to have a professional opinion,

39:53.683 --> 39:56.644
I'd have to have a fucking profession,
which I don't.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.485
But you're Jackie Moreno... right?

40:04.569 --> 40:06.487
I was. I was.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.699
Not anymore.
I don't work for Marrakesh Star.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.035
I haven't had a hit in years, you know?

40:12.118 --> 40:16.581
I'm fucking... dead in this business,
Mylene, okay?

40:16.664 --> 40:21.252
You know, I'm like a fugazi at this point,
which means I'm a fucking fake.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.297
- That's who I am.
- I'm sorry for your problems. I am.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.508
And I'm not gonna tell my uncle
about none of this.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.551
I appreciate that.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.804
But will you then please help me

40:31.888 --> 40:35.308
find a real record producer
and songwriter.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.354
- You know, someone amazing, someone great.
- Someone great? I...

40:39.812 --> 40:42.231
- I never said I wasn't great.
- I didn't mean it like that.

40:42.315 --> 40:43.733
Let me tell you something.
A few years ago,

40:43.816 --> 40:46.694
not too long ago, I was driving
a Rolls-Royce. I had a Porsche.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.363
You heard of the Grammys?

40:48.738 --> 40:50.657
- Yeah.
- I... I got three of those.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.452
Now I don't got nothing.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.664
- You got me, right?
- You... I got you. I got...

40:57.747 --> 40:59.749
You don't even know
if you're talented or not.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.125
Look, Mr. Moreno,

41:01.209 --> 41:04.420
I don't care if I'm talented.
I just wanna sing,

41:04.504 --> 41:06.839
- and I wanna get out of the Bronx.
- Mylene,

41:06.923 --> 41:09.592
this business isn't here
to hold your hand.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.094
Listen to me.

41:11.177 --> 41:15.348
What we do here, it's fucking essential.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.891
It's like oxygen.

41:16.975 --> 41:21.771
When a... When a true artist sings,
they don't hold back nothing.

41:21.854 --> 41:26.109
And it's... When you sing like that, it...
raises the dead.

41:26.192 --> 41:29.654
The world's dying
of a thousand heart attacks.

41:29.737 --> 41:32.740
We... heal them up
three minutes at a time.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.117
That's...

41:34.200 --> 41:37.328
It's a goddamn public service what we do.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.706
That's the only reason to make music.

41:39.956 --> 41:43.209
And if you...
You can't make music like that

41:43.292 --> 41:44.836
with doubts.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.587
It won't work.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.089
You gotta know.

41:48.798 --> 41:49.799
I know.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.384
All right, then you know.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.553
All right. So, fine.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.265
I'll ask around.
I'll help you get another producer.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.975
No, I don't want another producer.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.309
I want you.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.616
I worked on this song with Vinnie DiMirco.

42:17.118 --> 42:18.119
I know this one.

42:18.202 --> 42:22.206
Keep playing it, and you tell me
what I know and what I don't.

42:24.167 --> 42:29.047
<i>d Come with me d</i>

42:31.841 --> 42:38.347
<i>d And we shall run
Across the sky d</i>

42:41.976 --> 42:46.564
<i>d And illuminate the night d</i>

42:48.483 --> 42:53.362
<i>d Oh, I d</i>

42:56.365 --> 43:00.787
<i>d I will try and guide you d</i>

43:02.955 --> 43:07.293
<i>d To better times d</i>

43:18.221 --> 43:21.057
I should get back to Ramon
and the church now.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.851
No, it's... It's too dangerous out there.

43:23.935 --> 43:27.438
<i>Sí</i>. Still... I should go.

43:27.522 --> 43:28.898
- I'll take you there.
- No.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.733
I'll find my way.

43:30.817 --> 43:32.401
I'll take the flashlight, okay?

43:37.115 --> 43:38.116
Lydia.

43:40.076 --> 43:42.120
You say I don't love my brother. I...

43:43.996 --> 43:46.082
I've sacrificed my life for him.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.961
I've sacrificed...

43:50.837 --> 43:53.131
the only things that are dear to me.

43:56.509 --> 43:57.802
You know that.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.806
Don't make me lose my Mylene.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.476
Please.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.818
You see me as a bad man.

44:15.945 --> 44:18.072
Hm. Maybe I am.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.825
But where it counts most...

44:22.869 --> 44:24.579
I've been a man of my word.

44:28.374 --> 44:29.542
Haven't I?

44:31.252 --> 44:32.920
Lydia, haven't I?

44:33.004 --> 44:34.881
You have, Franny.

44:35.131 --> 44:36.215
You have.

44:38.259 --> 44:39.844
The girls in the club...

44:41.762 --> 44:43.973
I like to have a nice girl on my arm.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.684
I like to have a dance
every now and then. That's true.

44:47.894 --> 44:50.104
But I sleep alone, Lydia.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.064
Every night...

44:53.608 --> 44:55.318
since 1960.

44:57.278 --> 44:58.362
Make no mistake.

44:58.571 --> 44:59.947
I know.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.870
That is for Ramon.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.206
He... He won't accept it from me.

45:11.167 --> 45:14.295
Maybe you can slide it
into the collection basket...

45:14.879 --> 45:16.172
a little bit at a time.

45:16.881 --> 45:17.924
Okay?

45:20.593 --> 45:22.136
Thank you.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.349
I will make sure
you never lose your daughter.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.270
I will make sure my brother
is looked after...

45:32.104 --> 45:34.315
and that his <i>familia </i> stays intact.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.069
I promise you that.

45:39.946 --> 45:42.573
And I will close my eyes
when my heart is crying.

46:58.107 --> 47:00.735

47:07.450 --> 47:09.035
We all shook.

47:09.118 --> 47:10.619
This is crazy, but, Zeke, come on.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.538
I'm not sure retaliation
is our style, man.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.457
Why, Ra, because we special?

47:14.540 --> 47:16.751
Because we above all this?
How are we above all this?

47:17.960 --> 47:20.379
It ain't retaliation anyways,
it's a chance.

47:20.463 --> 47:22.882
We miss our chance,
the world's gonna play us for fools.

52:48.874 --> 52:50.167
Nothing. Chilled.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.545
Why won't you look at me?

Look at you for what?

52:55.381 --> 52:56.799
Look at me.

Zeke, I know you, and you've got those
mad eyes on to hide your sad eyes.

53:03.347 --> 53:04.890
I'm not sad or mad.

53:05.391 --> 53:06.392
Fine.

53:06.975 --> 53:07.976
Fine.

53:11.105 --> 53:13.190
Aren't you gonna ask me
how it went at the studio?

53:13.690 --> 53:14.733
How'd it go?

53:16.902 --> 53:18.112
Amazing.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.115
You sang good?

53:21.198 --> 53:23.742
Zeke, I sang better than I ever sang.

53:24.326 --> 53:27.913
We didn't get to record, but Jackie's
gonna write me a for-real song.

53:28.747 --> 53:29.873
Cool.

53:35.170 --> 53:39.466

and you always listen.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.928
Listen to what?

53:44.054 --> 53:45.848
Zeke, come on.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.115
Something bad happened tonight.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.492
But you're okay?

54:05.576 --> 54:06.743
