00:02.001 --> 00:03.503
Previously on Lost:

00:03.586 --> 00:05.463
Mayday! Mayday!

00:06.423 --> 00:09.842
French! The French are coming! I've
never been so happy to hear French!

00:09.927 --> 00:12.428
- Does anyone speak French?
- She does.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.600
"I'm alone now.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.435
On the island alone.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.522
Please, someone come.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.942
The others, they're...
They're dead.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.443
It killed them.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.948
It killed them all."

00:34.451 --> 00:37.328
- I can't stay here.
- There's nowhere to go.

00:37.413 --> 00:41.958
Someone has to walk the shore and map
the island, see what else there is.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.626
I hope we meet again.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.533
- What's happening?
- You know what's happening.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.954
- But I don't understand. Why...?
- He was your responsibility,

02:43.038 --> 02:45.540
but you gave him away, Claire.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.126
Everyone pays the price now.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.724
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
It's Charlie! It's Charlie!

03:46.435 --> 03:48.686
Wait, wait, wait a minute!

03:50.188 --> 03:52.523
It's OK! It's OK.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.528
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.200
You were sleepwalking. All right?

04:04.411 --> 04:06.287
OK.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.499
Claire, what happened?

04:33.315 --> 04:35.066
Must have been a hell of a nightmare.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.320
Who said it was a nightmare?

04:40.072 --> 04:41.864
When someone makes a fist so tight

04:41.949 --> 04:44.742
they dig their nails a quarter
of an inch into their palms,

04:44.826 --> 04:47.495
they probably weren't
dreaming about riding ponies.

04:48.372 --> 04:52.792
- Did you ever sleepwalk before?
- No. I don't think so.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.170
- How would I know?
- It'd get back to you.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.590
I had a girlfriend once that told me
I talked in my sleep.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.635
- What did you say?
- Don't know.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.721
Whatever it was, she didn't like it.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.979
- How was your OB/GYN in Sydney?
- Good. She was good.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.023
She was OK with letting you fly
in your third trimester?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.778
Yeah, I went for a checkup a week
before, and she said it would be fine.

05:21.697 --> 05:25.700
- Ultrasound was cool?
- Very healthy.

05:27.953 --> 05:32.581
- How you been feeling?
- OK. Back's pretty sore,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.501
but probably just from
sleeping on the ground.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.005
I get dizzy if I stand up too fast.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.091
And I have to pee all the time.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.429
- You eating enough?
- Boar and bananas.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.930
How many weeks in are you?

05:48.015 --> 05:51.684
What was the date that you found out
that you were pregnant?

05:54.229 --> 05:55.855
- Is it pink?
- I don't know yet.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.523
I mean, did you actually pee on it?

05:57.607 --> 06:00.192
- Just give me a second.
- Maybe you didn't do it right.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.528
- Thomas, I can pee on a stick.
- What color is it?

06:02.612 --> 06:03.863
How long's it been?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.657
Six... 66 seconds. Oh, gosh.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.704
- OK, there's definitely two lines.
- Two pink lines?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.206
Pink? No, no, no.
These are, like, red.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.042
What?

06:16.126 --> 06:17.209
They're pink.

06:17.294 --> 06:21.047
These two lines... First of all,
these tests are not always accurate.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.383
No, no, no. My uncle, you know,
we thought he had testicular cancer.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.053
- You remember that?
- He did. He's dead.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.889
Well, yeah... I mean, no, no.
It was like a wrong...

06:29.973 --> 06:33.684
It was a bad diagnosis. This thing
doesn't mean for sure you're pregnant.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.061
We should get another.

06:35.145 --> 06:39.732
I am six weeks late, OK?
Six weeks. That never happens.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.942
I'm pregnant.

06:44.946 --> 06:49.658
OK. OK, look,
it's all gonna be OK.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.952
I know. I know.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.333
Claire...

06:59.211 --> 07:02.338
You know, if we wanted to,
we could do this.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.716
- Stop it.
- No, I'm not kidding.

07:05.801 --> 07:09.261
- My mom would disown me.
- She basically has already.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.601
Yeah, and but with what? I mean,
my $5-an-hour job at Fish 'n Fry?

07:15.685 --> 07:20.856
You're not the only one with a job, you
know? I mean, I've got my painting.

07:21.733 --> 07:25.277
That's sweet, but...

07:25.362 --> 07:29.115
- This isn't what we want.
- Maybe it is.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.786
You know?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.080
This could be like...

07:38.458 --> 07:41.752
I don't know.
It could be, like, the best thing ever.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.551
You'd really want to try?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.387
Yeah.

07:58.228 --> 08:02.398
Claire, I love you.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.084
Well, this is a first.

08:22.586 --> 08:28.299
You standing still,
middle of the day, doing nothing.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.719
- Amazing.
- I'm doing something.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.554
Yeah? What's that?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.933
I'm sinking.

08:38.018 --> 08:42.770
Water goes out,
takes the sand with it and you sink.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.153
I used to do it with my mom
when I was a kid.

08:56.328 --> 09:00.206
New plan. You're gonna just sink
your way right off the island.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.999
Sayid would be proud.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.504
He's been gone for almost a week.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.757
Something tells me he'll be OK.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.512
So, what are you doing
this far from the caves?

09:15.597 --> 09:19.350
Bringing water down. Bringing fish back.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.732
Claire's gonna have the baby soon.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.580
Dear diary,

09:41.665 --> 09:44.500
still on the bloody island.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.211
Today, I swallowed a bug.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.382
Love, Claire.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.844
Here.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.848
What separates us from these
savage Yanks if we can't drink tea?

10:02.185 --> 10:05.479
- Feeling better?
- It was just a dream.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.777
I have this dream.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.904
I'm driving a bus,

10:13.989 --> 10:17.283
and my teeth start falling out.

10:17.367 --> 10:21.453
My mum is in the back,
eating biscuits.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.623
Everything smells of bacon.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.959
It's weird.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.628
Of course, I don't wake up screaming.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.755
I'm all right, Charlie.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.216
No, of course you are.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.637
It's just...

10:39.639 --> 10:41.140
...I think about you...

10:42.183 --> 10:44.268
...in this place.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.979
How hard it must be for you,

10:47.063 --> 10:49.982
without your family and your friends.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.569
And I think, we could be friends.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.155
I could be your friend.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.701
We don't have to do
each other's hair or anything.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.746
I just mean that, you know,

11:03.830 --> 11:09.084
if you needed someone
to talk to about anything,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.421
I'm here.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.719
Charlie...

11:26.603 --> 11:28.020
OK.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.692
- I didn't mean that I...
- It's cool, Claire. It's cool.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.868
Thomas cleaned out his whole loft.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.163
- I'm officially moving in on Tuesday.
- That is great!

11:46.247 --> 11:48.791
I know. He's awesome.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.961
- You know, maybe we shouldn't...
- No.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.381
- You're not backing out now.
- It seems silly.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.049
He's just a psychic, Claire.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.843
I thought you were into this,
all your astrology stuff.

11:59.928 --> 12:03.222
Yeah, I know, but I don't
need somebody telling me

12:03.306 --> 12:05.599
what's gonna happen
or how to live my life.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.185
It's not about what you need.
It's about what's fun.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.438
So unless you have another excuse...

12:12.565 --> 12:14.858
I'll need your hands for this.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.807
So when did you find out?

12:48.143 --> 12:50.561
- What?
- About the baby.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.446
Two days ago.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.623
She hasn't told her mum yet...

13:15.712 --> 13:18.130
What, should I not tell her?

13:22.510 --> 13:25.262
What? What is it?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.766
I'm sorry.

13:30.435 --> 13:34.062
I can't... I can't...

13:34.147 --> 13:36.148
What were you gonna...?
What did you see?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.568
- I'm not doing this reading.
- No, you were gonna say something.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.571
You'll have to leave. Now.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.158
Thanks, thanks very much.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.250
What a freak.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.106
Help me!

14:18.191 --> 14:22.152
Somebody's trying to hurt me!
Please! Help me!

14:24.447 --> 14:26.698
- Someone attacked her!
- What?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.575
- He held me down!
- Which way did he go?

14:28.660 --> 14:30.536
- I couldn't see...
- What's going on?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.704
Just now! He just ran away!

14:32.789 --> 14:34.665
Fan out, check the surrounding caves.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.125
- Wait, wait, hold on.
- Hurley, come on, let's go.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.420
Come on. Come on.
Let's sit down here, OK?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.631
- Can you get her some water?
- Sure.

14:43.174 --> 14:46.176
Claire, look at me.
It's OK. You're safe now.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.221
- Did you get a look at him at all?
- It was dark. I couldn't see.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.890
- Where did this happen?
- He was here!

14:51.975 --> 14:54.851
I mean, I was sleeping, and I woke up,

14:54.936 --> 14:57.688
and he was trying to hurt my baby!

14:57.772 --> 15:01.358
He had this thing, like a needle,

15:01.442 --> 15:04.152
and he stabbed me with it!

15:06.364 --> 15:08.991
He was trying to hurt my baby.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.536
It's OK. It's OK.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.544
We hoofed around
the entire perimeter, man.

15:20.628 --> 15:25.048
- Nobody saw or heard anything?
- Nada. Everyone was asleep.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.593
So, I had an idea.

15:27.677 --> 15:31.221
I'm out here looking for some psycho
with Scott and Steve, right?

15:31.306 --> 15:34.391
And I'm realizing,
who the hell are Scott and Steve?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.935
- I'm not following you.
- Look, if I was a cop,

15:37.020 --> 15:39.688
and some woman got attacked,
we'd canvas, right?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.899
Knock on doors, find witnesses.
But we don't even have doors.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.943
You're not helping me understand...

15:45.028 --> 15:47.112
We don't know who's living here,

15:47.196 --> 15:48.822
and who's still at the beach.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.782
I mean, we don't even know each other.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.410
My name isn't Hurley.
It's Hugo Reyes.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.705
Hurley's just a nickname
I have, all right?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.582
Why? I'm not telling.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.209
The point is, we got
to find out who everyone is.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.253
- You want to start a census?
- A registry.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.797
Names, what people look like,
who's related to who.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.967
We lay down the law,
people will stop attacking each other.

16:09.052 --> 16:12.137
Seems like someone's punched
or stabbed every other day.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.057
We got to find out who did this to her.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.903
You all right?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.329
Don't worry.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.291
If you want to close your eyes,
I'll be here all night.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.169
I won't let anyone get to you.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.424
I won't leave you, Claire.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.718
Promise.

17:01.229 --> 17:04.522
- Wow, we have drapes now.
- I know.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.817
I feel all grown up.

17:06.901 --> 17:10.237
- You like 'em?
- Yeah. They're good.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.574
I don't know why drapes
represent age for me.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.411
I guess it just feels like
something my mum would do.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.663
Oh, Sasha called.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.208
They're going out tonight.
They wanted to know if we'd go.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.131
What?

17:29.215 --> 17:32.551
I didn't eat all the chips.
There's another bag.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.058
Claire? I can't do this.

17:41.811 --> 17:45.480
Do what? Did you have a bad day?

17:50.486 --> 17:53.238
This isn't working.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.658
- Come on, you knew that.
- I what?

18:05.251 --> 18:09.755
Just so I'm not overreacting here,

18:09.839 --> 18:11.840
are you breaking up with me?

18:11.924 --> 18:15.761
For the past three months, it's just,
there's some plan, some responsibility,

18:15.845 --> 18:18.472
somewhere we have to be,
someone you have to talk to.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.766
I'm trying to make sure
when the baby comes...

18:20.850 --> 18:24.561
"When the baby..." Yeah.
I mean, that is just not...

18:24.645 --> 18:27.105
If it's like this now, you know,

18:27.190 --> 18:29.941
what's it gonna be like
when the baby comes?

18:30.026 --> 18:33.195
- But you said we should do this.
- Yeah.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.406
Yeah, well, now it's real.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.283
You can't just change your mind.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.369
How in the hell am I
supposed to be a dad, Claire?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.246
How about my painting? My life?

18:43.331 --> 18:45.624
I knew... I knew
this was gonna happen.

18:45.708 --> 18:49.252
I told you so. Perfect. Now I get
all your daddy abandonment crap.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.923
Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try
and justify what you're doing!

18:53.007 --> 18:55.467
I have done nothing!
I've done absolutely nothing.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.760
What, I have?

18:56.844 --> 18:58.929
You don't think
I've seen what you've done?

18:59.013 --> 19:02.349
- Excuse me?
- You were supposed to be on the Pill.

19:02.934 --> 19:06.311
- You think I got pregnant on purpose?
- I don't even care.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.189
Or that this was some kind of plan?
You are out of your mind!

19:09.273 --> 19:11.608
- It's over, Claire!
- No, it's not over!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.568
- I'm out of here.
- Thomas!

19:28.084 --> 19:30.585
John, right? John Locke?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.380
Is this about your census?

19:33.464 --> 19:36.633
Yeah, you know, I thought
it would be a good idea, you know,

19:36.717 --> 19:40.095
get everyone's name
and place of residence.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.305
And who's checking on you?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.934
Me.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.103
It was a joke.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.317
- Good one.
- Yep.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.027
You already know my name.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.698
I lived most of my life
in Tustin, California.

19:59.782 --> 20:03.159
Cool. And reason for travel?

20:03.661 --> 20:06.788
The reason you were in Australia?

20:06.873 --> 20:10.333
- I was looking for something.
- Looking.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.294
Right on.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.754
Something.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.132
So, did you find it?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.303
No, it found me.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.642
- Anything else?
- No, no, that's good.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.311
Thanks.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.688
Hey, I know
I already talked to you,

20:31.772 --> 20:34.107
but I just wanted to get
away from him for a second.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.902
Did you see anyone
leave the beach last night?

20:36.986 --> 20:39.112
People come and go, but...

20:39.196 --> 20:41.615
No, I don't know.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.950
What?

20:44.035 --> 20:46.536
- I'm not sure anything happened.
- Wait, what?

20:47.830 --> 20:49.956
Claire told Michael
and I that this attacker

20:50.041 --> 20:53.501
tried to inject her with something.
But there was no mark on her stomach.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.755
She wakes up two nights screaming.
First time, sleepwalking.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.174
Think she's making this up?
She was terrified.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.093
She said he was hurting her baby.
Why would someone do that

21:02.178 --> 21:04.262
- with us 20 feet away?
- You think she's lying?

21:04.347 --> 21:06.723
No. Pregnant woman
have extremely lucid...

21:06.807 --> 21:08.767
- Lucid.
- Textbook anxiety nightmares.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.394
You know everything that's
going on with everyone?

21:15.191 --> 21:16.274
So, what do we do?

21:16.359 --> 21:19.694
Claire's due in a little more
than a week. Maybe two.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.821
But if she stays stressed out like this

21:21.906 --> 21:24.950
or has another panic attack,
it could trigger an early labor.

21:25.034 --> 21:29.663
Out here with no instruments,
no monitors, no anesthetic...

21:30.998 --> 21:33.875
That would not be good.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.419
It's not all in her head.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.804
- Hey, Lance.
- Sorry?

21:45.888 --> 21:48.390
Lance. Your name's Lance, right?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.892
- Ethan.
- Dude, that's right.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.228
Lance is a skinny guy
with glasses and red hair.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.855
I can see how you'd confuse us.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.942
Sorry, dude.
Lots of names and faces.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.653
Pathetic. You'd think
after a couple weeks on the island

22:01.737 --> 22:03.822
with the same people,
we'd know each other.

22:03.906 --> 22:07.283
- You're right. You would think so.
- So we're doing this list,

22:07.368 --> 22:10.245
all the survivors' names,
home addresses, stuff like that.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.163
OK, well, you already have my name.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.833
- All right, not Lance.
- Definitely not.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.293
- Last name?
- Rom.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.754
- Rom, R-O-M?
- That's right.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.173
- Great. Where you from, Ethan Rom?
- Ontario.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.635
Right on. Love Canada. Great...

22:28.180 --> 22:30.682
Well, that should do it.
Thanks for your time, dude.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.018
- Hey, what's this for?
- Oh, it's nothing.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.895
Just, you know,
thought it'd be a good idea.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.278
Claire?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.697
Did you find him?

22:45.781 --> 22:48.700
- No.
- What if he comes back?

22:51.412 --> 22:52.871
Claire...

22:54.623 --> 22:56.374
This situation that we're in,

22:56.459 --> 23:00.712
the crash, that no one's coming,
this place,

23:00.796 --> 23:03.089
it can kind of mess
with your head a little

23:03.174 --> 23:05.675
and make you see things
that aren't actually there.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.386
Now, I know it feels very real...

23:08.471 --> 23:12.849
- I don't under...
- Look, your baby's coming.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.226
Soon.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.063
And I can't even imagine
how scary that must be for you.

23:18.147 --> 23:23.860
But the more upset you are, the more
dangerous it is for you, and your baby.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.239
So I want you to take these.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.159
- What are they?
- It's a sedative.

23:31.243 --> 23:35.205
Very mild, commonly used
in situations like yours.

23:35.289 --> 23:39.417
It won't harm the baby. I promise.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.294
You don't believe me.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.924
- Claire...
- You think I'm making this up?

23:47.009 --> 23:49.594
I get attacked, and you want
to give me sleeping pills?

23:49.678 --> 23:52.764
They're not sleeping...
Look, it's a very mild sedative.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.100
- I'm leaving.
- What? No! Claire. Claire...

23:55.184 --> 23:58.061
It was safe at the beach.
It's not safe here.

23:58.145 --> 24:03.024
- Don't do this. Think about the baby.
- Don't talk to me about the baby.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.319
I'm sick of everyone telling me
what to do. Let go of me.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.073
You OK?

24:12.159 --> 24:14.369
What did you say to her?

24:31.512 --> 24:34.931
- Yes?
- Mr. Malkin, we met before?

24:35.015 --> 24:39.227
- Yes, I remember.
- You wouldn't give me a reading.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.479
I was hoping you would now.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.491
If you're a psychic,
why do you have to count it?

24:53.576 --> 24:57.871
- That's not how it works.
- I was just joking.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.011
So... how does it work?

25:13.721 --> 25:15.722
I don't know.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.649
When did he leave you?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.195
Last week.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.115
Is that why you
didn't want to do my reading?

25:34.200 --> 25:38.161
No, no, no. I saw something,
sort of a blurry thing.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.331
And blurry's bad?

25:41.415 --> 25:43.541
Blurry's bad.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.044
That's why I stopped the reading.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.838
Are you sure you want to go on now?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.552
Yes, please.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.077
I can tell you,

26:19.161 --> 26:20.703
this is important.

26:21.872 --> 26:26.459
- OK.
- It is crucial that you, yourself,

26:26.543 --> 26:27.877
raise this child.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.755
You mean with Thomas? Is he...?

26:30.839 --> 26:34.550
The father of this child will play
no part in its life, nor yours.

26:35.844 --> 26:40.098
- So, what exactly are you saying?
- This child parented by anyone else,

26:40.182 --> 26:42.225
anyone other than you...

26:44.687 --> 26:47.772
- Danger surrounds this baby.
- Danger?

26:47.856 --> 26:50.275
Your nature, your spirit,

26:50.359 --> 26:54.028
your goodness must be an influence
in the development of this child.

26:58.534 --> 27:03.579
Look, if Thomas and I don't,
you know, get back together,

27:03.664 --> 27:06.708
I'm putting this baby up for adoption.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.712
I just wanted to find out what would
give the baby the happiest life.

27:10.796 --> 27:15.717
There is no happy life.
Not for this child, not without you.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.970
- I don't...
- There can't be another.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.306
You mustn't allow another
to raise your baby.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.892
OK. Great. Thanks for taking my 200.

27:24.977 --> 27:29.230
Look, take it. Miss Littleton,
I am begging you just to consider...

27:29.315 --> 27:32.775
- I can't raise this child by myself.
- You have to listen to me!

27:32.860 --> 27:34.819
Thanks for your time and my money back!

27:34.903 --> 27:37.905
The baby needs your protection!

27:39.658 --> 27:42.535
Miss Littleton! Please!

27:55.883 --> 27:58.801
- Hello?
- Miss Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.013
- Oh, my God.
- Listen to me. I have a plan,

28:02.097 --> 28:04.182
something that will
make this all better.

28:04.266 --> 28:07.352
You've got to stop calling me.
It's too late, all right?

28:07.436 --> 28:09.687
I'm going to see
Adoptive Services tomorrow.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.648
I've been telling you for months,
you cannot do that.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.234
What I do with my baby
is none of your business.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.070
If you don't do what I'm suggesting,

28:17.154 --> 28:18.821
great danger will befall...

28:18.906 --> 28:21.866
Great danger will befall you
if you don't stop calling me

28:21.950 --> 28:25.036
- in the middle of the night.
- I know what you're feeling inside.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.538
You're doubting your decision
to give up the baby.

28:27.623 --> 28:31.125
Look, I'm begging you, don't do it.
At least hear my plan first.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.252
Good night.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.968
Hi.

28:41.804 --> 28:45.014
- Where are you going?
- Back to the beach.

28:45.099 --> 28:49.268
- Well, what happened? Did Jack...?
- Jack tried to dope me.

28:49.353 --> 28:52.730
He thinks I'm making all this up,
that none of it really happened.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.525
Right. So, to prove your sanity,

28:55.609 --> 28:59.487
you go tromping through
the jungle alone. Well done.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.327
I'm not crazy, Charlie.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.256
You want my information?

29:18.340 --> 29:20.383
Name: Shannon Rutherford.

29:20.467 --> 29:24.220
Age: 20.
Address: Craphole Island.

29:24.304 --> 29:28.224
So, where were you guys last night?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.393
The beach.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.354
Why the interrogation?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.982
You're like the twentieth person
to ask me that.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.609
Why is everyone uptight
about answering questions?

29:38.694 --> 29:40.903
Well, maybe we're just not cool with you

29:40.988 --> 29:43.698
setting up your own
little Patriot Act, man.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.867
He's a liberal.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.036
- Seriously, why the list?
- It's nothing.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.205
We had an incident
in the valley last night.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.666
- An incident?
- Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl.

29:53.750 --> 29:58.379
You know her?
She kind of got attacked.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.798
- What?
- She OK?

30:00.883 --> 30:04.927
- Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...
- I am not moving to the Rape Caves.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.182
Your life would be much easier
if you just had the manifest.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.226
We crossed out names of the dead
after we burned the fuselage,

30:12.311 --> 30:14.395
so should be a full roster
of the rest of us.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.606
What? Really? Who has it?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.609
Who do you think?

30:29.495 --> 30:32.246
I'm just gonna lay it out straight.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.915
OK, you do that.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.250
I hear you have the flight manifest,

30:36.335 --> 30:39.212
and I need it
and want you to give it to me.

30:40.214 --> 30:43.257
- That so?
- Now, you could do what you normally do

30:43.342 --> 30:45.927
when someone asks for something,
tell me to screw off.

30:46.011 --> 30:51.307
- Screw off?
- Or you could just give it to me.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.395
'Cause, dude, you could use the points.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.817
Well, gosh, you sure know how
to butter a man up, Stay-Puff.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.945
It's a gift.

31:08.450 --> 31:12.286
Manifest is in
the brown suitcase. Take it.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.749
- Please let me carry your bag.
- I'm fine.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.918
I know you're fine,
but I can carry your bag.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.711
Why did you come after me?

31:20.796 --> 31:24.298
Well, it's probably because I like you.

31:25.217 --> 31:29.053
- What?
- You don't like me, Charlie, OK?

31:29.137 --> 31:31.931
You just want
to rescue me because I'm...

31:32.015 --> 31:34.141
Because of this.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.979
But I'm fine, OK? I don't
need rescuing. I don't need...

31:38.814 --> 31:40.690
Claire? What is it?

31:41.567 --> 31:44.527
What? Claire, what? What is it?

31:51.368 --> 31:53.244
- Was that another one?
- Yeah.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.871
We need to time the contractions.
That's what you do.

31:55.956 --> 32:00.042
Time the contractions, OK? One sugar
plum fairy, two sugar plum fairy...

32:00.127 --> 32:02.837
You just need to calm down,
all right? Big deep breaths.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.217
- Bloody hell.
- I need you to go get Jack.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.636
- I'll be all right.
- I'm not leaving you alone.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.139
- I can deliver a baby. I can do this.
- Please, go!

32:13.223 --> 32:15.057
- You don't know how to...
- Listen.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.602
I might not know what I'm doing,
but I'll figure it out.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.771
If I can kick drugs,
I can deliver a baby.

32:20.856 --> 32:25.359
Let me explain. I'm a drug addict.
I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.154
- Get Jack!
- Right.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.044
Arlene and Joseph
will bring you to Melbourne.

32:43.128 --> 32:46.213
They'll pay your
living and medical expenses.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.134
We found you an apartment.
It's a really nice two-bedroom place,

32:50.218 --> 32:53.054
and we think you're
gonna be really comfortable in it.

32:53.138 --> 32:56.766
As discussed, once the baby's born
and handed over to the Stewarts,

32:56.850 --> 32:59.060
you'll have no right
to see the child again.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.729
You'll have no right
to correspond with the child,

33:01.813 --> 33:03.856
it will be entirely up
to Arlene and Joseph

33:03.940 --> 33:08.277
to decide whether to tell the child
anything about you. Understood?

33:09.696 --> 33:12.406
- Yes.
- Upon your discharge from the hospital,

33:12.491 --> 33:16.243
you will be given an
additional payment of $20,000.

33:19.206 --> 33:22.875
I just want to make sure that you're
gonna take really good care of the baby.

33:22.959 --> 33:26.128
Of course we will.

33:26.213 --> 33:30.591
Now, I'll need you to sign
and date here where indicated.

33:38.850 --> 33:43.104
Do you know Catch a Falling Star?

33:43.188 --> 33:45.064
It's a song, like a lullaby.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.942
"Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket."

33:49.820 --> 33:53.322
My dad used to sing
that to me when I was little.

33:54.616 --> 33:59.537
Do you think you could sing it
to the baby once in a while?

33:59.621 --> 34:02.623
Of course.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.849
It's not working.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.809
Here.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.966
I'm...

34:54.050 --> 34:56.177
I'm... I'm sorry.

34:56.261 --> 35:01.849
- I can't do this.
- What? No! No!

35:07.773 --> 35:11.525
OK, what is it? What's your offer?

35:20.202 --> 35:23.788
- Thank God! What's your name?
- Ethan. Are you all right?

35:23.872 --> 35:25.915
Go to the caves.
Run to the caves. Get Jack.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.875
- Tell him Claire...
- Claire. She OK?

35:27.959 --> 35:31.712
She's having the baby. Go fast, OK?
I'll be with her, on the path there. Go!

35:47.896 --> 35:50.231
- Claire!
- I'm here!

35:50.315 --> 35:53.025
Claire! OK, Jack's coming.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.152
- How you doing?
- It hurts.

35:55.237 --> 35:58.280
OK, just take my hand.
Squeeze. OK, breathe.

35:58.365 --> 36:02.785
Inhale. Exhale.
Good. Just breathe.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.206
Inhale. OK, good.

36:07.290 --> 36:11.043
- Oh, I'm not supposed to be here.
- We all feel like that a little bit.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.004
I know. It's just...

36:14.089 --> 36:16.465
Someone promised me
it would be different.

36:16.550 --> 36:19.927
Well, he was wrong.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.014
Yeah. He was wrong.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.684
You spent the last
four months telling me

36:26.768 --> 36:29.061
I have to raise the baby myself.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.814
Now you're giving me money
and saying I don't have to?

36:31.898 --> 36:35.442
I found a couple in Los Angeles
who are very eager to adopt.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.362
The baby will be safe in their care.

36:38.446 --> 36:41.198
- Now, I've foreseen...
- You've foreseen.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.450
I don't even know
why I'm here. I'm sorry.

36:43.535 --> 36:47.371
I know this sounds ridiculous,
Claire, all this psychic business,

36:47.455 --> 36:51.500
and I appreciate that you must
think I'm a raving madman.

36:51.585 --> 36:54.837
But this is what must happen.

36:57.591 --> 37:01.719
So you're giving me $6,000

37:01.803 --> 37:05.681
to give my baby to a couple
of strangers in Los Angeles?

37:05.765 --> 37:10.185
$12,000. The other six
when you arrive in Los Angeles.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.023
And they're not strangers, Claire.
They're good people.

37:17.277 --> 37:22.031
- A psychic?
- I know. It's embarrassing.

37:22.115 --> 37:26.410
And after everything,
he was just full of it.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.084
Or not.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.881
I mean, all he wanted

37:38.965 --> 37:41.133
was that no one else
raise your baby, right?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.847
Maybe he knew.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.935
I mean, if you wanted it bad enough...

37:51.019 --> 37:54.563
You know, if he had the gift,

37:54.648 --> 37:57.066
and I believe some people do...

37:58.193 --> 38:00.903
Maybe he knew, Claire.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.460
I can't go tomorrow. I have to get my...

38:16.544 --> 38:19.129
It has to be this flight.
It can't be any other.

38:19.214 --> 38:23.300
They're already scheduled to meet you
when you arrive. Flight 815.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.719
Flight 815.

38:34.562 --> 38:38.899
There was no couple in Los Angeles.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.778
He knew.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.572
He knew about the plane,

38:45.657 --> 38:47.825
what was gonna happen...

38:49.953 --> 38:52.413
Oh, my God, he knew.

39:06.052 --> 39:09.596
- You feel another one coming?
- I don't think so.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.685
Where the hell is Jack?

39:16.938 --> 39:20.232
You know, I think...

39:21.901 --> 39:24.445
- I think I'm all right.
- The contractions?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.614
Maybe that was the last one.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.534
Please, let that have been the last one.

39:31.995 --> 39:37.332
Jack said that stress
can cause a false labor.

39:37.834 --> 39:40.127
You sure you're all right?

39:40.962 --> 39:42.254
No pain.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.218
Birthing emergency averted.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.471
I told you I'd take care of you.

39:50.805 --> 39:54.308
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You're quite welcome.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.480
You think you can
make it back to the caves?

40:02.484 --> 40:04.610
I won't let anything happen to you.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.075
- OK.
- OK.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.993
Let's go.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.082
Sayid.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.666
Listen to me.

40:25.548 --> 40:28.008
I found her, the Frenchwoman.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.594
I need some water.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.305
- What happened?
- The woman on the island...

40:37.852 --> 40:40.813
I had to come back. I had to come back.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.282
We're not alone.

41:09.384 --> 41:13.637
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah, he just kicked.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.848
Here.

41:24.357 --> 41:25.983
We got a problem.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.153
The manifest.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.364
Jack, the census,
the names of everyone who survived.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.782
All 46 of us.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.660
I interviewed everyone,
here, at the beach.

41:36.744 --> 41:40.497
I got their names. One of them...
One of them is...

41:40.582 --> 41:43.125
Jack.

41:43.209 --> 41:46.044
One of them isn't in the manifest.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.672
He wasn't on the plane.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.717
Hello, there.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.932
Ethan, where's Jack?
