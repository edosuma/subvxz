01:10.103 --> 01:12.484
<i>At</i> first, <i>I</i> didn't believe it either.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.179
<i>But the gods of Olympus are real.</i>

01:15.376 --> 01:18.690
<i>And sometimes,
these gods have children with humans...</i>

01:18.879 --> 01:20.690
<i>called half-bloods.</i>

01:20.881 --> 01:22.260
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

01:22.449 --> 01:26.492
<i>I'm Percy Jackson.
Son of Poseidon, god of the sea.</i>

01:34.962 --> 01:40.315
Seven <i>years ago, four of these children</i>
were <i>headed to Camp Half-Blood...</i>

01:40.501 --> 01:44.043
<i>the only place on Earth
that is safe for our kind.</i>

01:45.006 --> 01:46.817
<i>Only three of them made it.</i>

01:54.181 --> 01:55.685
We're almost at camp!

01:59.754 --> 02:00.961
Look out!

02:03.357 --> 02:05.066
Grover! Luke, help him!

02:05.259 --> 02:06.330
Grover, are you okay?

02:06.428 --> 02:08.501
My leg. it's stuck.

02:13.034 --> 02:14.447
Come on. I got you.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.107
Keep going. I'll hold them off.

02:16.203 --> 02:19.313
No, Thalia. They'll kill you.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.324
Go, Luke. I'll be right behind you.

02:29.684 --> 02:31.324
Over here!

02:32.420 --> 02:33.900
Annabeth, come on!

02:36.524 --> 02:37.595
Stay back.

02:46.568 --> 02:47.877
Thalia, come on!

02:51.073 --> 02:53.920
No! Thalia!

02:58.146 --> 03:03.328
<i>He! name was Thalia,
and she gave her life to save three.</i>

03:08.156 --> 03:11.664
<i>And so, as Thalia lay dying...</i>

03:11.860 --> 03:16.108
<i>her father Zeus found
another way for her to live.</i>

03:28.844 --> 03:31.521
<i>A way for all half-bloods to live.</i>

03:31.714 --> 03:37.568
<i>A gift to ensure no one in Camp Half-Blood
would die the same way.</i>

03:39.322 --> 03:44.401
<i>The barrier, to protect them from those
who lived for their death.</i>

03:46.129 --> 03:47.541
Let's go!

03:51.334 --> 03:55.616
<i>Every day,
the story of Thalia's bra very inspires me.</i>

03:57.473 --> 04:01.118
<i>And her tree protects my home.</i>

04:02.912 --> 04:05.793
<i>But not always my head.</i>

04:14.223 --> 04:17.366
How nice of you to show up
just to watch me win.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.339
Everything they say about you
is wrong, Clarisse.

04:20.529 --> 04:22.808
You actually do have a sense of humor.

04:31.374 --> 04:34.085
- There goes another one.
- Go, Percy!

04:34.878 --> 04:38.055
Come on, Percy!
I got 50 drachma on you!

04:39.082 --> 04:40.427
You bet on this?

04:40.617 --> 04:42.256
What, is that wrong?

04:47.524 --> 04:50.268
'97 Xinomavro. Would you like a taste?

04:50.460 --> 04:54.036
Why do you torture yourself, Dionysus?

04:56.966 --> 04:58.914
It was one transgression, one.

04:59.102 --> 05:01.585
And with a naiad,
for the sake of Olympus.

05:01.771 --> 05:03.775
How was I to know that
Zeus had a thing for her?

05:03.873 --> 05:07.188
Or that he could
hold a grudge for so long?

05:12.416 --> 05:14.125
I think the fact
that Zeus is immortal...

05:14.218 --> 05:17.361
means there's no limit
to how long he can hold a grudge.

05:17.554 --> 05:20.470
The Christians have a guy
who can do this trick in reverse.

05:20.557 --> 05:22.197
Now, that's a god.

05:25.229 --> 05:27.677
Aren't you tired of getting beat,
Jackson?

05:44.982 --> 05:47.260
Clarissa!

05:51.856 --> 05:53.667
Help! Help me!

06:09.340 --> 06:11.014
Tereus, grab my hand!

06:11.742 --> 06:13.655
Good luck with that.

06:15.145 --> 06:16.217
'90! you.

06:23.854 --> 06:25.027
Thank you!

06:26.391 --> 06:27.370
Percy!

06:38.236 --> 06:41.015
Clarissa! Clarissa! Clarissa!

06:48.213 --> 06:51.356
So, what I'm wondering is, Percy...

06:51.549 --> 06:55.501
that first quest you went on,
beginner's luck, wasn't it?

06:56.254 --> 07:00.206
Clarisse, he saved Olympus.
That's more than you've ever done.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.431
Whatever.

07:03.629 --> 07:05.804
Even for the daughter of the god of war,
that girl's a mythic bi...

07:05.897 --> 07:07.104
Don't listen to her, Percy.

07:07.198 --> 07:08.907
You know, it's too late.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.275
Besides, she has a point.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.041
Dude, what are you talking about?

07:13.138 --> 07:15.211
You're more than a one-quest wonder.

07:15.306 --> 07:17.380
You recovered Ares' stolen chariot.

07:17.476 --> 07:19.754
No, actually, that was Clarissa.

07:19.945 --> 07:23.225
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.

07:23.382 --> 07:24.384
Clarissa?

07:25.551 --> 07:28.433
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?

07:32.958 --> 07:35.373
Thank you for trying to cheer me up.

07:35.894 --> 07:37.307
I would lick a pair of cloven hooves...

07:37.396 --> 07:39.356
before I let you listen to Clarisse
instead of us.

07:39.431 --> 07:40.433
No offense, Grover.

07:40.532 --> 07:42.343
None taken. Is that an offer?

07:42.434 --> 07:44.746
Listen, it doesn't matter
what Clarissa has done.

07:44.836 --> 07:47.217
To Chiron and Mr. D,
you're still the rock star.

07:47.306 --> 07:49.049
Perry Johnson!

07:49.508 --> 07:51.615
Actually, it's Percy Jackson, sir.

07:51.810 --> 07:52.789
Whatever.

07:52.979 --> 07:55.621
I have a very important task
to entrust you with.

07:55.714 --> 07:56.750
You do?

07:56.849 --> 07:59.833
Yes, it's a critical assignment.
And it's very taxing.

07:59.919 --> 08:01.160
Can I trust you?

08:01.253 --> 08:02.255
Of course.

08:02.354 --> 08:04.393
Good. You'll need this.

08:06.658 --> 08:10.907
Sometimes these events
get a little messy.

08:19.739 --> 08:21.447
<i>Maybe Clarissa was right.</i>

08:23.976 --> 08:26.322
Maybe I only stopped
Luke from destroying Olympus...

08:26.412 --> 08:29.454
because I had Annabeth and Grover
helping me, right?

08:32.217 --> 08:33.563
Dad?

08:34.754 --> 08:36.496
Poseidon?

08:44.063 --> 08:48.915
Have you ever felt like everything
you've ever done...

08:49.101 --> 08:51.083
maybe you didn't really do it?

08:52.239 --> 08:54.380
It was all just luck or something?

08:57.177 --> 08:59.181
No, of course not.

08:59.379 --> 09:00.882
You're a god.

09:02.515 --> 09:07.162
Speaking as someone who's not,
it sucks.

09:09.756 --> 09:13.401
It makes you question whether
you were all that good to begin with.

09:18.565 --> 09:22.574
Okay. Good not talking to you.

09:23.203 --> 09:24.239
Again.

09:35.448 --> 09:36.895
So, he just walked right in?

09:36.984 --> 09:38.897
He just walked straight into camp?

09:38.986 --> 09:40.968
It seems he lumbered, actually.

09:41.154 --> 09:43.136
I don't care if he sashayed!

09:43.323 --> 09:46.865
What's the point of having this mystical
protective barrier if any thing can just...

09:46.960 --> 09:49.773
Could you not touch that, please?
That's a very precious Grenache.

09:49.863 --> 09:50.865
I think the point is...

09:50.964 --> 09:54.073
since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

09:54.167 --> 09:57.709
- Don't say it.
- ...lt means he's most likely a god-spawn.

10:00.173 --> 10:02.486
Yeah, but the spawn of which god?

10:02.676 --> 10:04.385
I know.

10:08.416 --> 10:09.953
Poseidon.

10:22.630 --> 10:25.341
So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.

10:25.433 --> 10:26.504
I'm sure it's fine.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.636
I'm sure you don't get summoned

10:27.735 --> 10:29.655
to the Big House
without a major-league screw-up.

10:29.703 --> 10:30.877
I didn't screw up.

10:30.972 --> 10:33.386
I cleaned the entire coliseum.
And vacuumed.

10:33.474 --> 10:35.456
Don't let him get into your head, okay?

10:35.543 --> 10:38.425
We have a dead camper walking.
Dead camper walking, here.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.323
Thanks. This is friendship.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.359
I'm just playing,
just trying to have a little fun.

10:42.450 --> 10:43.692
It's all right.

10:43.885 --> 10:45.924
So, it's okay if I get your cabin
when you get kicked out?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.400
Seriously, don't worry. it's just Mr. D.

10:48.489 --> 10:51.667
I mean, if Chiron had summoned you,
then...

10:56.197 --> 10:58.476
You are so massively screwed.

11:00.234 --> 11:03.218
Whatever it is you think I did,
I didn't do it.

11:03.405 --> 11:04.908
You've done nothing, Percy.

11:05.006 --> 11:06.179
Exactly.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.794
As you know, you are believed
to be Poseidon's only heir.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.687
Yeah, so?

11:12.881 --> 11:16.992
So, it would seem that belief
has been held in error.

11:17.252 --> 11:19.256
Hold on.
You're saying Percy has a brother?

11:19.354 --> 11:20.857
Or a sister.

11:23.592 --> 11:26.667
Holy Styx. Another Poseidon half-blood.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.475
Not exactly.

11:30.665 --> 11:33.171
Technically, Tyson is not a half-blood.

11:33.368 --> 11:35.611
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

11:35.704 --> 11:36.911
I don't get it.

11:37.006 --> 11:40.320
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.584
Nymph. Sea nymph.

11:42.777 --> 11:44.953
And when you cross a deity with a nymph,
you get...

11:45.047 --> 11:47.655
Don't touch. it's a Gewurztraminer.

11:47.850 --> 11:49.091
Hi.

11:50.685 --> 11:52.189
Hi, Brother.

12:13.609 --> 12:16.855
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

12:16.946 --> 12:19.053
Yeah. Yeah.

12:20.883 --> 12:23.058
Hey. they put peppers in yours.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.192
Are you gonna eat that?

12:26.188 --> 12:27.601
Go ahead.

12:31.561 --> 12:33.338
Is he messing with me?

12:33.529 --> 12:34.804
I think he's hungry.

12:34.897 --> 12:36.936
No, not him. I meant Poseidon.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.011
Is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

12:39.101 --> 12:42.382
A half-brother? A Cyclops? Come on.

12:44.274 --> 12:47.520
I think the politically correct term
is "ocularly impaired."

12:47.710 --> 12:49.191
And a half-brother
is better than nothing.

12:49.279 --> 12:50.691
I like having a brother.

12:50.780 --> 12:52.386
Dad was cool to bring me here.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.191
Dad? Dad brought you here?

12:55.051 --> 12:56.861
I was upstate, in the woods.

12:56.953 --> 13:01.133
One day, this trident shows up over
my head, and then it started moving south.

13:01.224 --> 13:04.765
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

13:05.328 --> 13:06.740
It glowed.

13:06.930 --> 13:09.971
Well, somebody has got a new brother.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.379
And I can see he's got his daddy's eyes.

13:13.569 --> 13:14.548
Well...

13:15.271 --> 13:16.250
"Eye."

13:17.573 --> 13:20.182
You should really get him
some sprayable mist.

13:20.343 --> 13:23.988
Anyway, it is kind of interesting timing,
don't you think?

13:24.180 --> 13:29.100
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

13:29.285 --> 13:30.390
represent.

13:30.587 --> 13:31.931
Bull.

13:32.322 --> 13:33.564
Excuse me?

13:33.757 --> 13:35.101
Smells like bull.

13:45.702 --> 13:47.274
We got barrier action.

13:49.005 --> 13:50.611
Hey, Chris, you coming?

13:50.807 --> 13:52.982
No, I'm good.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.460
That is so awesome.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.203
It's chill. The barrier is holding.

14:19.236 --> 14:20.375
A Colchis bull.

14:20.471 --> 14:21.678
Run!

14:34.752 --> 14:35.731
Percy!

14:36.888 --> 14:37.890
Come on!

15:05.683 --> 15:07.596
- We have to find its weak spot.
- Does it have one?

15:07.685 --> 15:09.689
Percy, distract it for me.

15:51.296 --> 15:52.902
I got this.

16:36.209 --> 16:37.211
Bad bull.

16:39.145 --> 16:40.489
Hey, rust bucket!

17:59.759 --> 18:01.798
Damn it, Jackson.

18:04.298 --> 18:08.809
Do you have any idea
how hard Colchis bulls are to come by?

18:09.937 --> 18:12.442
Maybe next time
you try to drown someone...

18:13.573 --> 18:18.425
you'll first make sure he's not
a demigod who can swim.

18:23.784 --> 18:24.855
Luke?

18:24.952 --> 18:28.459
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

18:31.158 --> 18:33.231
You know, prophecy.

18:34.862 --> 18:37.505
What prophecy?
What are you talking about?

18:37.698 --> 18:39.178
You don't know?

18:39.967 --> 18:40.969
Huh.

18:41.636 --> 18:46.020
Add that to the long list of things
your buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

18:47.007 --> 18:50.150
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

18:51.145 --> 18:53.287
they don't care about us.

18:53.814 --> 18:56.593
To them, we're just kids.

18:56.784 --> 19:00.064
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

19:00.455 --> 19:02.903
I'm not the only half-blood
who thinks so.

19:05.860 --> 19:07.102
Think about it.

19:20.641 --> 19:21.883
What did I miss?

19:21.977 --> 19:23.184
Where's Percy?

19:23.278 --> 19:26.387
Last time I saw him,
he was getting dragged by a Colchis bull.

19:26.481 --> 19:28.360
Hey, you.

19:28.784 --> 19:30.128
How come you aren't barbecued?

19:30.218 --> 19:31.790
Cyclopes are fireproof.

19:31.887 --> 19:34.335
How did the bull get through the barrier?

19:35.824 --> 19:37.635
Oh, my gods.

20:00.482 --> 20:01.791
Poisoned.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.896
Is she... ls the tree dead?

20:04.085 --> 20:05.657
No, but dying.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.066
A condition we're about to become
all too familiar with.

20:12.594 --> 20:16.569
Everybody, we're going to need
a guard detail to patrol the perimeter.

20:16.765 --> 20:19.647
It feels like she's dying all over again.

20:20.769 --> 20:22.808
Who would do this?

20:23.839 --> 20:25.548
Luke poisoned the tree.

20:26.408 --> 20:27.649
Percy!

20:28.010 --> 20:29.786
Yay, you're alive.

20:30.512 --> 20:32.721
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

20:33.349 --> 20:34.829
Luke let the bull in.

20:35.017 --> 20:36.429
Without the tree's barrier...

20:36.518 --> 20:38.329
he probably figures there's enough

20:38.420 --> 20:40.095
demi-Titans out there
to get him what he wants.

20:40.189 --> 20:42.398
And that would be what, exactly?

20:43.092 --> 20:45.803
Our annihilation, Ms. La Rue.

20:46.295 --> 20:48.436
Our annihilation.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.051
How's the antidote coming?

20:58.140 --> 20:59.415
Slowly.

21:00.777 --> 21:03.259
I know this probably isn't the best time...

21:05.615 --> 21:07.061
but there's something I have to ask you.

21:07.149 --> 21:08.494
What is it?

21:10.487 --> 21:13.095
It was something Luke said
about a prophecy...

21:13.289 --> 21:15.271
how I'm mentioned in it.

21:16.058 --> 21:18.131
Do you know anything about this?

21:19.996 --> 21:22.673
Knowledge isn't always power, Percy.

21:23.466 --> 21:25.470
Sometimes, it's a burden.

21:26.135 --> 21:27.673
I know that.

21:28.671 --> 21:31.307
But like you said,
I've been pretty unexceptional lately.

21:31.308 --> 21:31.718
But like you said,
I've been pretty unexceptional lately.

21:31.808 --> 21:35.919
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

21:36.113 --> 21:38.425
They say that when the gods
wish to torture us...

21:38.515 --> 21:40.292
they answer our prayers.

21:40.483 --> 21:44.094
Necklace of Harmonia, Hercules' bow,
Golden Apple of Discord.

21:44.521 --> 21:46.093
Three millennia of gods and demigods...

21:46.189 --> 21:49.264
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

21:49.359 --> 21:53.038
Persephone did come up with Miracle-Gro.
Maybe we can try that.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.505
That's it.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.042
Right here.

21:58.368 --> 22:01.580
That is not gonna cure Thalia's tree
so much as get us all killed.

22:01.671 --> 22:02.879
Me, in particular.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.820
It's perfect. it's exactly what we need.

22:07.310 --> 22:08.791
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

22:08.879 --> 22:09.950
No.

22:15.819 --> 22:19.600
I was hoping to spare you this onus
a little while longer, but go inside.

22:19.690 --> 22:21.170
Upstairs, to the attic.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.764
And when you come back down,
we'll talk some more.

22:23.861 --> 22:26.572
Assuming you're still sane, that is.

22:59.597 --> 23:02.012
I am the spirit of Delphi...

23:02.200 --> 23:05.047
speaker of the prophecies
of Phoebus Apollo...

23:05.236 --> 23:07.514
slayer of the mighty Python.

23:07.705 --> 23:11.350
Approach, seeker, and ask.

23:13.744 --> 23:16.159
I heard there was a prophecy about me.

23:16.347 --> 23:17.726
Aye.

23:17.916 --> 23:22.700
But before you learn the future,
know first the past.

23:24.622 --> 23:28.039
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

23:28.226 --> 23:30.265
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

23:30.461 --> 23:33.742
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

23:34.298 --> 23:36.007
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

23:36.200 --> 23:40.620
<i>a force so evil,
he devoured his own children.</i>

23:40.805 --> 23:43.287
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

23:43.475 --> 23:46.755
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

23:51.750 --> 23:53.356
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

23:53.452 --> 23:58.030
<i>and banished his remains
to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

23:58.790 --> 24:02.936
<i>But Kronos is fated to rise again...</i>

24:03.128 --> 24:07.842
<i>to exact his vengeance on Olympus,
and the world.</i>

24:09.668 --> 24:14.952
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

24:15.140 --> 24:18.352
<i>This child shall be our salvation...</i>

24:18.543 --> 24:21.686
<i>or the cause of our destruction.</i>

24:24.449 --> 24:28.925
<i>It all begins when two cousins
grapple for a fleece...</i>

24:29.354 --> 24:32.338
<i>the son of the sea
and the lightning thief.</i>

24:33.192 --> 24:34.263
Luke.

24:34.459 --> 24:36.965
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

24:37.162 --> 24:40.112
shall reach 20 against all odds.

24:40.299 --> 24:43.545
"And see the world in endless sleep...

24:43.736 --> 24:47.516
"the evil soul,
cursed blade shall reap.

24:47.707 --> 24:49.552
"A single choice shall end his days...

24:49.642 --> 24:53.024
"Olympus to preserve or raze."

24:53.212 --> 24:56.663
And that is "raze" with a
as in "destroy."

24:57.182 --> 24:58.663
l asked.

25:01.153 --> 25:05.037
Is there any chance,
any chance at all...

25:05.224 --> 25:08.471
that I might not be the guy
in the prophecy?

25:08.661 --> 25:11.508
The Oracle references
a half-blood of the eldest gods.

25:11.597 --> 25:16.711
You are the only living half-blood heir
of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

25:16.902 --> 25:19.215
The prophecy could refer only to you.

25:19.405 --> 25:22.981
What if I destroy Olympus...

25:23.176 --> 25:26.319
by not being good enough to save it?

25:27.413 --> 25:29.861
That seems to be the question,
doesn't it?

25:31.351 --> 25:32.592
It's absolutely out of the question.

25:32.685 --> 25:34.667
If you could just listen to me
for one moment...

25:34.754 --> 25:36.702
lam listening.
You want to go on a quest.

25:36.789 --> 25:38.099
It must be Thursday.

25:38.191 --> 25:41.334
I'm serious. I'm absolutely
sure that this is gonna work.

25:43.429 --> 25:45.104
It was such a good year.

25:45.298 --> 25:47.907
The Golden Fleece
can heal any living person or thing...

25:48.001 --> 25:50.313
including Thalia's tree.

25:50.503 --> 25:53.646
We heal the tree,
we restore the barrier around camp.

25:54.607 --> 25:57.022
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.089
Underwood.

25:58.178 --> 25:59.317
Whatever.

25:59.746 --> 26:03.162
Every satyr who has ever
gone after the Fleece has died.

26:03.349 --> 26:05.832
Right? I mentioned that to her.

26:06.653 --> 26:10.469
But it's a risk I'm willing to take
for the good of the camp.

26:11.157 --> 26:13.470
Look, the last I heard...

26:13.660 --> 26:16.336
the Golden Fleece
was in the Sea of Monsters...

26:16.430 --> 26:18.503
what the humans call
the Bermuda Triangle.

26:18.599 --> 26:21.013
A place not only a satyr
should be afraid of.

26:21.101 --> 26:24.848
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

26:24.971 --> 26:25.950
Annabeth.

26:26.039 --> 26:29.114
Whatever. it's a terrible idea.

26:29.310 --> 26:31.758
I've had a grand idea.

26:33.614 --> 26:36.028
Unless Thalia's tree can be cured...

26:36.217 --> 26:40.363
and the protective barrier
around our camp restored...

26:40.554 --> 26:44.199
then every demigod, centaur,
satyr and nymph...

26:44.725 --> 26:47.106
will be killed within days,
if not sooner.

26:47.195 --> 26:48.869
Hey, you okay?

26:49.530 --> 26:52.013
Don't worry, camp will be okay.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.478
You have to have faith, right?

26:54.568 --> 26:57.177
But fortunately,
I have considered the matter.

26:57.972 --> 26:58.951
And after great study...

26:59.040 --> 27:02.388
I have determined that the only thing
that has the power to save Thalia's tree...

27:02.476 --> 27:04.185
and therefore our home...

27:04.311 --> 27:06.315
is the Golden Fleece of myth...

27:08.716 --> 27:09.855
What?

27:10.551 --> 27:11.827
Whose touch...

27:14.889 --> 27:17.873
can heal every person
and every thing.

27:19.426 --> 27:23.469
So, a quest, a mission of mercy,
if you will...

27:23.665 --> 27:26.079
into uncharted and deadly waters...

27:26.468 --> 27:29.509
with nothing less at stake
than our own survival.

27:30.138 --> 27:35.787
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn,
as you know, to the power of the Fleece.

27:35.977 --> 27:40.054
And therefore, it must be a satyr
who will guide a half-blood on this quest.

27:40.415 --> 27:41.895
Thanks a lot.

27:42.550 --> 27:43.621
Ichneutae!

27:44.219 --> 27:46.223
Will you guide the champion?

27:46.421 --> 27:48.095
Oh, yeah.

27:48.290 --> 27:51.102
Good. Great! That's great!

27:52.494 --> 27:53.473
Yeah!

27:56.464 --> 28:01.475
As to who that champion might be,
our plight calls for only our finest hero.

28:02.137 --> 28:06.385
The best of us,
the strongest and the bravest.

28:06.574 --> 28:10.048
The scion of the god of war...

28:10.245 --> 28:11.247
Clarissa!

28:11.881 --> 28:12.860
Yes!

28:16.618 --> 28:17.689
Thank you.

28:19.321 --> 28:20.996
Her name, he gets right.

28:25.627 --> 28:27.735
Hey, Clarissa. Clarissa!

28:27.930 --> 28:28.909
What?

28:29.732 --> 28:32.146
Don't worry about always
coming in second, Jackson.

28:32.234 --> 28:33.806
You do get used to it.

28:33.902 --> 28:35.906
I think, right?
Obviously, I wouldn't know.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.285
Listen, Luke is still out there.

28:37.305 --> 28:39.686
He's involved with the Fleece somehow...

28:40.008 --> 28:42.548
and I've got a feeling
that he's not done yet.

28:42.645 --> 28:43.624
Really?

28:43.779 --> 28:46.490
Because I've got a feeling
that I don't really care.

28:46.582 --> 28:48.393
Gosh, don't look so wounded.

28:49.618 --> 28:51.896
Listen, there are generals,
and there are foot soldiers.

28:51.987 --> 28:55.164
And you should feel lucky that you even
made it into the army at all.

28:55.257 --> 28:58.799
Just try not to screw up anything
too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

28:59.995 --> 29:00.895
Let's go.

29:00.896 --> 29:01.396
Let's go.

29:10.806 --> 29:13.483
"Cursed blade shall reap."

29:15.111 --> 29:17.184
"Cursed blade shall reap."

29:18.514 --> 29:22.295
What good is a prophecy
if you can't even understand it?

29:25.621 --> 29:28.468
I guess you don't have
any answers either, Dad.

29:29.959 --> 29:31.598
This was your sword.

29:43.973 --> 29:44.952
This is a bad idea.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.316
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.915
You were going to say that you're
going after the Fleece to save the camp.

29:49.012 --> 29:51.494
Actually, he was gonna say "we" were.

29:52.683 --> 29:54.858
Look, I get what you're doing here.

29:55.051 --> 29:56.589
You're worried about
the one-quest wonder thing...

29:56.686 --> 29:58.394
and you want to make your bones.

29:58.488 --> 30:00.629
But lchneutae and Clarisse
are already going after the Fleece...

30:00.724 --> 30:03.104
and it's not cool to bogart
on someone else's quest.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.969
I think this is my quest, too.

30:05.061 --> 30:06.838
The Oracle says
he wrestles Luke for the Fleece.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.210
"Grapples." But she also said...

30:11.267 --> 30:14.377
that I'm destined to destroy Olympus,
or save it.

30:17.574 --> 30:19.852
Saving is better, obviously.

30:20.043 --> 30:21.456
Yeah.

30:22.379 --> 30:25.829
Let me pack a bag and make sure
my health insurance is paid up.

30:41.598 --> 30:43.580
How are we gonna get past them?

30:43.767 --> 30:45.680
I think they're looking
for threats trying to come in...

30:45.769 --> 30:48.150
not people trying to sneak out...

30:48.338 --> 30:51.049
so, I think we're cool
as long as we stay quiet.

30:53.377 --> 30:54.356
Sorry!

30:58.716 --> 30:59.855
We're...

31:01.118 --> 31:02.724
We're guarding, too.

31:04.121 --> 31:05.192
You left without me.

31:05.289 --> 31:08.034
Tyson, where we're going,
it's very dangerous.

31:08.225 --> 31:09.604
I know. I'm not stupid.

31:09.694 --> 31:11.003
No, just dumb.

31:11.295 --> 31:12.605
I want to help.

31:14.098 --> 31:15.545
You'd do it for me.

31:15.733 --> 31:17.236
I appreciate that...

31:17.435 --> 31:21.284
but I don't think you understand
exactly how dangerous this is going to be.

31:21.372 --> 31:22.511
I do.

31:22.707 --> 31:24.882
The Fleece is guarded by Polyphemus.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.154
Who?

31:26.243 --> 31:27.383
Polyphemus.

31:27.579 --> 31:30.221
Closest thing Cyclopes
have got to someone famous.

31:30.315 --> 31:33.595
Captured Odysseus. Lives in Circeland.

31:33.785 --> 31:35.266
Wait, Circeland?

31:35.453 --> 31:36.865
Built on his island.

31:36.954 --> 31:38.367
Long story.

31:38.556 --> 31:40.731
Point is, maybe I can talk to him.

31:40.925 --> 31:42.907
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

31:43.094 --> 31:45.975
No, you can't,
because I'm not going with a Cyclops.

31:47.498 --> 31:50.641
Then we got a problem,
because I'm not going without one.

31:50.968 --> 31:55.183
This Polyphemus is probably what killed
every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.

31:55.273 --> 31:57.221
You want me to lead you to a Cyclops?
Fine.

31:57.308 --> 32:00.588
But I'm bringing along one of my own,
for protection.

32:01.279 --> 32:02.486
No way.

32:03.181 --> 32:04.160
No.

32:11.923 --> 32:13.923
What do you think's
gonna attract more attention...

32:13.959 --> 32:15.496
all the noise or the one eye?

32:15.593 --> 32:17.575
Just give the guy a break, okay?

32:19.197 --> 32:20.268
Okay, fine.

32:20.365 --> 32:21.367
Keep it down.

32:21.466 --> 32:23.676
This is crazy hard to come by...

32:23.869 --> 32:25.851
and I only brought it along
in case of an emergency...

32:25.937 --> 32:30.185
which I guess this is an emergency,
so... here.

32:32.778 --> 32:33.814
Mist?

32:34.012 --> 32:36.051
It makes the mystical look normal.

32:36.148 --> 32:37.788
"Side effects may include handsomeness,

32:37.883 --> 32:40.263
headache, self-esteem
and low self-esteem."

32:40.352 --> 32:42.312
And just know
that if the camp wasn't in danger...

32:42.355 --> 32:43.716
I wouldn't be wasting this on you.

32:43.789 --> 32:45.167
Wasting what?

32:47.293 --> 32:50.641
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.

32:59.471 --> 33:01.077
Extreme makeover alert.

33:04.610 --> 33:05.919
How do I look?

33:07.113 --> 33:09.652
A bit like Dad, actually.

33:09.848 --> 33:11.830
He's still a Cyclops.

33:13.252 --> 33:16.725
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?

33:17.623 --> 33:20.334
Somewhere off the coast of Florida.
South.

33:22.428 --> 33:23.567
Over here.

33:23.763 --> 33:25.209
Annie! Hey!

33:39.178 --> 33:41.251
It's the Chariot of Damnation.

33:41.447 --> 33:43.555
Looks like a New York City cab.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.094
Same difference.

33:47.219 --> 33:50.101
No dollars, no credit cards.
Drachmas only.

33:50.289 --> 33:52.066
Exact... Change... Please.

33:52.258 --> 33:53.898
Chop, chop! Get in the cab.

33:53.993 --> 33:56.875
We just had this cab sanitized
for your protection.

33:57.063 --> 33:58.373
It wasn't this year, though.

33:58.465 --> 34:00.913
Excuse me,
we're trying to get to Florida.

34:01.268 --> 34:03.716
Our kind of fare. Pricey.

34:08.608 --> 34:11.387
<i>Hey, there.
This is Ganymede, cupbearer to Zeus.</i>

34:11.578 --> 34:13.924
<i>And when I'm out buying wine
for the lord of the skies...</i>

34:14.013 --> 34:15.891
<i>I always remember to buckle up.</i>

34:15.982 --> 34:18.261
Maybe we should have flown commercial.

34:20.687 --> 34:21.757
Look out!

34:24.858 --> 34:27.034
Calm down.
If we didn't know what we were doing...

34:27.127 --> 34:28.766
We wouldn't be licensed.

34:31.697 --> 34:33.202
They don't have eyes.

34:34.201 --> 34:35.442
Yeah.

34:37.070 --> 34:39.143
- I know, awful picture.
- Bad hair day.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.583
We do so have an eye.

34:40.672 --> 34:42.348
It's around here somewhere.

34:42.442 --> 34:45.085
The last time I saw it, you put it
in the glove compartment, Anger.

34:45.212 --> 34:46.623
Don't use that tone with my name.

34:46.714 --> 34:48.489
It's not there this time.

34:50.885 --> 34:53.197
Wasp always puts it with the keys.

34:53.853 --> 34:56.565
- And it's 20,120.
- So is mine!

34:56.757 --> 34:58.830
Shouldn't the driver get the eye?

34:59.827 --> 35:01.570
She'll be fine.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.211
Tempest, split!

35:13.173 --> 35:14.152
Percy!

35:17.044 --> 35:18.957
We paid extra for that option.

35:23.551 --> 35:26.160
The kid is right.
The driver should have the eyeball.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.461
He's a freaking genius!

35:27.555 --> 35:29.001
You're the one that put it in the visor.

35:29.089 --> 35:32.631
While it's on the table,
I haven't had a turn in quite some time.

35:33.761 --> 35:35.504
Oh, no, you didn't!

35:35.696 --> 35:36.835
Yes, I did.

35:39.933 --> 35:41.505
Hands on the wheel at least, okay?

35:45.573 --> 35:47.020
- We're all gonna die!
- Pipe down.

35:47.108 --> 35:50.456
Didn't that prophecy say
you're gonna make it till at least 20?

35:50.545 --> 35:51.666
You know about the prophecy?

35:51.712 --> 35:53.455
- Sure.
- The Oracle is a friend.

35:53.548 --> 35:55.393
- We're besties.
- B-F-F!

35:57.018 --> 35:58.225
EVE! Eye! Eye!

35:58.419 --> 36:00.298
Gross! Get it off me!

36:03.291 --> 36:05.466
What do you know about the prophecy?

36:07.462 --> 36:08.441
No!

36:11.767 --> 36:12.872
Okay, okay.

36:14.169 --> 36:19.921
30. 31, 75,12.

36:20.108 --> 36:21.087
What?

36:22.377 --> 36:23.915
Percy, you got your answer!

36:24.012 --> 36:25.584
All I got were numbers.

36:25.681 --> 36:27.127
- Yes.
- You'll know...

36:27.315 --> 36:28.955
When it matters.

36:32.153 --> 36:33.964
I think we're a little short on drachmas.

36:34.055 --> 36:35.034
What?

36:47.569 --> 36:48.981
What do you... think we're...
running here?

36:49.071 --> 36:49.981
A charity?

36:50.072 --> 36:51.706
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

36:51.707 --> 36:52.947
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

37:02.084 --> 37:03.155
That was...

37:03.352 --> 37:04.559
I know.

37:05.254 --> 37:08.033
Awesome! Can we go again?

37:08.224 --> 37:10.331
We're definitely not in Florida.

37:11.326 --> 37:13.866
I think we're in Olympus.

37:14.529 --> 37:17.810
Hail to you, great Zeus!
Forgive our trespass on Olympus.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.642
We're seeking transport to Florida.

37:21.437 --> 37:22.416
Zeus?

37:23.072 --> 37:24.051
Zeus?

37:24.607 --> 37:25.586
Zeus?

37:25.775 --> 37:28.782
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?

37:28.878 --> 37:30.518
This is the Capitol building.

37:30.613 --> 37:33.425
We're in Washington, D.C. Okay?

37:35.685 --> 37:36.824
It looks like Olympus.

37:36.919 --> 37:39.835
Right down to the dudes with power
who only care about themselves.

37:39.922 --> 37:41.801
We need to find a bus station.

37:41.891 --> 37:43.895
First we need to get some money.

37:49.131 --> 37:51.546
<i>Hey, there,
valued half-blood account holder!</i>

37:51.634 --> 37:54.641
<i>Sign up for our new Aphrodite Express
credit card, and you can...</i>

37:54.737 --> 37:58.780
Can I get four
venti half-caf no-whip lattes?

37:58.975 --> 38:01.720
And an extra shot of nectar.

38:08.017 --> 38:08.996
Nectar?

38:09.086 --> 38:11.898
If you haven't had,
then you haven't lived, buddy.

38:18.295 --> 38:19.935
Hecatonshire.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.109
Hey.

38:22.232 --> 38:24.373
I see you got your hands full.

38:27.170 --> 38:28.445
Room for cream?

38:28.571 --> 38:31.646
Nectar. Double shot.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.756
I've lived.

38:42.619 --> 38:45.033
This might be the most fun
I've ever had.

38:45.222 --> 38:46.361
Ever.

38:46.557 --> 38:50.098
Yeah, anything's gotta be better
than living in the woods, right?

38:50.293 --> 38:52.776
Living in the woods would have been fine
if you were there.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.004
Everything's better with a brother.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.610
You know, technically,
we don't have the same mom.

38:58.702 --> 39:02.278
So we're still brothers!
I know! How cool is that?

39:02.473 --> 39:03.851
Arctic.

39:05.609 --> 39:06.953
It's too sweet, don't you think?

39:07.044 --> 39:09.357
No, nectar's never too sweet.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.432
Get off me!

39:15.886 --> 39:17.697
- Get off me!
- Grover!

39:28.966 --> 39:29.968
Percy!

39:32.903 --> 39:35.011
- Damn!
- Was that Chris Rodriguez?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.949
How did they do that?

39:38.342 --> 39:42.021
Back at camp, Luke said that
there were other half-bloods who turned.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.890
What do you mean, "turned"?

39:44.482 --> 39:46.088
To his side.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.295
Luke has Grover.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.196
The Oracle was right.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.671
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.800
But what does Luke want
with the Fleece anyway?

39:57.895 --> 39:58.966
I don't know.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.304
But if we're gonna get Grover back,
we need to find Luke.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.245
But we don't know where he is.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.349
I know someone who does. Come on.

40:17.315 --> 40:20.789
What, are we shipping ourselves
overnight express to the Sea of Monsters?

40:20.885 --> 40:24.028
You want to find Luke?
His dad will know where he is.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.705
Olympic Parcel Service. Come on.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.243
Like it? He'll love it.

40:35.334 --> 40:39.012
Yes, Hephaestus does do quality work.
Everyone else these days, hacks.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.812
Excuse me, we're looking for Hermes.

40:40.905 --> 40:43.855
I'm sorry to be the god of obviousness,
but I'm with a customer.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.587
You want an overnight shipment to Hades,
that will be 250 drachmas.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.252
Perfect. Thank you, sweetness.

40:50.449 --> 40:53.797
I will take care of that for you,
and I'll see you next week.

40:54.186 --> 40:55.895
Now, you.

40:56.088 --> 40:57.659
You are here about Hermes?

40:57.756 --> 40:59.635
His son, actually.
It's kind of important.

40:59.724 --> 41:02.537
Yeah, I could tell the way you
burst in here, all rude-like.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.701
His son's name is Luke Castellan.

41:07.733 --> 41:11.274
What has that wayward boy of mine
gotten himself into now?

41:11.804 --> 41:13.615
Wait, you're...

41:13.706 --> 41:14.708
Hermes.

41:14.907 --> 41:17.116
Little insulted
you didn't recognize me.

41:17.209 --> 41:20.524
My feelings might have even been hurt if I
wasn't such a self-confident individual.

41:20.613 --> 41:22.652
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm killing these shorts.

41:22.748 --> 41:23.819
Sir, we're looking for Luke...

41:23.916 --> 41:26.057
because he attacked Camp Half-Blood
and kidnapped our friend.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.896
And we really need your help,
and we don't have a lot of time.

41:28.988 --> 41:32.200
That's really cute,
how you finish each other's sentences.

41:33.459 --> 41:34.530
Follow.

41:36.261 --> 41:39.439
You like this tie? I just bought it.
Hermés, of course.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.036
Check it out.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.707
State-of-the-art sorting,
processing and packaging facility.

41:43.803 --> 41:46.548
If you can box it, we can ship it
at the speed of...

41:46.639 --> 41:48.211
Well, me.

41:48.407 --> 41:51.482
We have plans to expand next year.
We're finding we have some space issues.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.354
So picture this, only bigger.

41:53.446 --> 41:54.551
Don't touch that.

41:54.647 --> 41:56.720
We're the fastest-growing
Olympian industry.

41:56.816 --> 41:59.425
It took a while to get up and running,
but Rome wasn't built in a day.

41:59.518 --> 42:00.827
Trust me, I was there.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.233
Excuse me, sir,
we're in a bit of a hurry.

42:03.323 --> 42:05.066
Relax, my friend. Take it slow.

42:05.158 --> 42:07.436
Come on! Give me a break!

42:07.626 --> 42:10.303
Easy for you to say, Your Eminence.

42:10.496 --> 42:14.346
Actually, Martha, it's not easy for him.
He's the god of freaking speed.

42:14.434 --> 42:19.013
Except he's not the one whose butt
is stuck to a big silver stick forever!

42:19.205 --> 42:21.688
Hey, guys, what did <i>I</i> say?

42:21.875 --> 42:25.052
When we meet new people,
protract your S's. it's more dramatic.

42:25.144 --> 42:26.590
Makes an impression.

42:27.213 --> 42:29.787
I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.

42:29.883 --> 42:32.161
It is a stereotype and it's offensive.

42:32.285 --> 42:34.598
Bad enough some of our relatives
are hanging out with Medusa...

42:34.688 --> 42:35.861
turning people to stone.

42:35.956 --> 42:36.935
All right.

42:37.023 --> 42:39.232
I love your hair.
I wish my hair would do that.

42:39.325 --> 42:40.533
Yeah, that will happen.

42:40.627 --> 42:43.041
Why don't you guys
make yourselves useful?

42:43.129 --> 42:45.408
Demi-Google Luke for me.
These kids are looking for him.

42:45.499 --> 42:47.241
- Why?
- Do they have a death wish?

42:47.333 --> 42:49.042
It doesn't matter. Just...

42:49.168 --> 42:50.273
Didn't even say "please."

42:50.371 --> 42:52.683
Told you! We should have taken
that job with Hercules.

42:52.773 --> 42:54.516
They're an acquired taste.

42:55.141 --> 42:56.918
Luke. I don't know what to do about him.

42:57.010 --> 43:00.119
I've tried reaching out, but the kid's angry.
He's resentful.

43:00.214 --> 43:01.974
And he holds a grudge
like nobody's business.

43:02.015 --> 43:03.519
Just like his mother,
come to think of it.

43:03.617 --> 43:05.462
Yeah, he's not my biggest fan either.

43:05.552 --> 43:09.436
If you're gonna cross paths or,
Zeus forbid, swords with him...

43:09.623 --> 43:13.541
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to have a thing or two to help you out.

43:13.627 --> 43:15.631
Collector's item, mint condition.

43:15.729 --> 43:18.212
<i>From Hercules Busts Heads, Season One.</i>

43:18.399 --> 43:19.879
<i>Hercules Busts Heads?</i>

43:20.067 --> 43:21.445
Best TV show ever.

43:21.568 --> 43:24.518
So, of course, cancelled.

43:25.139 --> 43:27.018
Got this off Deity-Bay.

43:27.208 --> 43:30.283
You twist the cap off this, you release the
winds from the four corners of the Earth.

43:30.377 --> 43:32.518
Now, you tell me that isn't cool.

43:32.713 --> 43:34.285
Whoa! No, not in here!

43:34.982 --> 43:36.018
Not in here.

43:36.117 --> 43:39.499
By the gods, George was right.
You do have a death wish.

43:40.354 --> 43:41.801
Now, you're also...

43:43.257 --> 43:45.432
You're also gonna want one of these.

43:51.265 --> 43:52.575
Thanks.

43:52.767 --> 43:54.680
Mythical box sealer?

43:54.869 --> 43:57.580
You wound me. Truly, I am wounded.

43:57.772 --> 44:01.018
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator.
Trademark pending.

44:01.208 --> 44:02.848
Anything you outline with this...

44:02.943 --> 44:04.082
Not in here.

44:04.545 --> 44:05.889
Will disappear.

44:06.581 --> 44:07.959
Gone. Instant hole.

44:08.049 --> 44:09.325
"Demi-Google Luke," he said.

44:09.417 --> 44:11.490
Except, how am I supposed to
type without fingers?

44:11.586 --> 44:13.123
You were supposed to use the mouse!

44:13.220 --> 44:14.633
I'm a snake. I eat mice.

44:14.722 --> 44:16.533
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?

44:16.624 --> 44:17.831
Did he just say "thank you"?

44:17.925 --> 44:19.497
I'm sure it was just a lapse.

44:19.594 --> 44:21.200
Luke's on a yacht called the Andromeda.

44:21.296 --> 44:23.710
It's passing by Chesapeake Beach
as we speak.

44:23.798 --> 44:24.800
Thank you.

44:24.899 --> 44:26.642
You're so welcome.

44:26.734 --> 44:28.079
There, you happy?

44:28.736 --> 44:29.715
Hush.

44:30.905 --> 44:32.318
Thank you very much.

44:32.407 --> 44:33.887
Hey, listen...

44:36.711 --> 44:38.283
If you see Luke...

44:38.480 --> 44:41.726
please explain to him for me...

44:42.784 --> 44:46.065
that parents,
we make mistakes sometimes.

44:46.454 --> 44:49.301
He has every right to be angry at me.

44:49.491 --> 44:51.974
Just, please tell him
not to be angry with the world.

44:52.060 --> 44:56.103
I'm not sure if there's anything
that I can say that will change him.

44:56.298 --> 44:57.539
Tl"!-

44:58.166 --> 45:00.148
If it's one thing I've learned
in 3000 years...

45:00.235 --> 45:02.582
it's you can't give up on family.

45:09.845 --> 45:11.382
Thanks again.

45:13.248 --> 45:14.786
He'll never make it.

45:15.684 --> 45:16.789
That's lunch!

45:25.961 --> 45:28.170
That's it. That's Luke's yacht.

45:28.364 --> 45:29.935
What do we do? Swim?

45:30.132 --> 45:31.613
But it's water.

45:32.801 --> 45:34.282
Dad will help.

45:38.307 --> 45:39.286
Hey, Dad.

45:39.475 --> 45:42.618
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood
and rescue a satyr named Grover.

45:42.711 --> 45:46.253
And we could really use your help
getting to that ship out there.

45:47.783 --> 45:48.991
Poseidon?

45:49.685 --> 45:50.664
Dad?

45:50.987 --> 45:52.365
It was a nice try, big guy...

45:52.455 --> 45:55.268
but don't be upset when he doesn't...

46:01.865 --> 46:03.368
answer.

46:10.039 --> 46:11.918
It's a hippocampus.

46:24.220 --> 46:25.427
Hi, girl.

46:27.390 --> 46:28.530
Boy-

46:31.795 --> 46:33.070
Come here.

46:37.467 --> 46:40.109
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.

46:40.770 --> 46:43.218
All I've been doing is asking.

46:58.755 --> 47:00.031
Are you coming?

47:00.990 --> 47:01.969
Yeah.

47:05.662 --> 47:06.937
Are you ready?

47:07.130 --> 47:08.269
Yeah.

47:08.465 --> 47:09.706
Giddy up!

48:16.367 --> 48:17.506
Back up!

48:18.136 --> 48:19.275
Back up.

48:29.747 --> 48:31.194
Thank you, friend.

48:31.516 --> 48:32.757
Tyson.

48:33.184 --> 48:34.995
Come on, buddy. We gotta go.

48:39.725 --> 48:41.171
You want some sugar?

48:51.202 --> 48:52.649
- Have you seen it?
- No, man.

48:52.738 --> 48:53.717
Did he show it to you?

48:53.805 --> 48:55.012
Wait until you see it.

48:55.106 --> 48:57.247
It took him long enough to find it.

48:59.745 --> 49:02.661
<i>That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan Nakamura,
and Shana Beauregard.</i>

49:02.748 --> 49:04.353
Luke's been recruiting.

49:07.285 --> 49:09.130
This is a nice boat.

49:09.320 --> 49:11.199
How are we gonna find Grover?

49:11.957 --> 49:15.134
Luke is probably keeping him
below deck somewhere.

49:15.327 --> 49:16.671
Like, in a brig.

49:16.795 --> 49:19.141
I don't think yachts have brigs, Percy.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.078
Follow me.

49:26.772 --> 49:29.654
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.

49:30.176 --> 49:32.818
How much longer are we gonna
be on this boat, anyway?

49:32.911 --> 49:34.824
Doesn't matter, just watch it.

49:45.491 --> 49:47.495
It's so time to go.

49:47.860 --> 49:49.967
Hey. Percy. Percy!

49:54.533 --> 49:56.242
Tyson, do you have to
make so much noise?

49:56.335 --> 49:57.644
Sorry!

50:14.253 --> 50:15.232
Chris?

50:15.321 --> 50:16.461
Hey.

50:16.823 --> 50:18.771
What have you done with Grover?

50:19.391 --> 50:20.701
Grover?

50:21.193 --> 50:23.334
Grover's the least of your worries.

50:25.131 --> 50:26.476
<i>Guess who's here.</i>

50:35.508 --> 50:39.118
What a surprise.
If it isn't my two favorite cousins.

50:39.312 --> 50:40.485
Three.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.457
I'm a son of Poseidon, too.

50:43.150 --> 50:46.930
That's funny, because Poseidon
doesn't have any other half-blood sons.

50:47.053 --> 50:48.795
I'm a Cyclops.

50:51.391 --> 50:52.462
Mist.

50:52.659 --> 50:54.299
You don't say.

50:58.231 --> 51:00.008
It's been a long time.

51:01.668 --> 51:03.547
You look good.

51:05.072 --> 51:06.416
Where's Grover?

51:06.606 --> 51:08.383
Grover, Grover.

51:08.575 --> 51:10.819
Grover, yes.
Right, the satyr.

51:11.011 --> 51:13.516
He should be in the Sea of Monsters
right about now.

51:13.613 --> 51:17.190
I sent him on ahead with some friends.
We're kind of on the clock.

51:17.851 --> 51:19.263
Wait, you're not...

51:19.753 --> 51:22.635
You're not just trying to stop us
from getting the Fleece.

51:22.723 --> 51:24.169
I need it, too.

51:25.726 --> 51:28.539
I got something
only the Fleece can revive.

51:28.729 --> 51:30.608
And it's not a tree.

51:32.733 --> 51:34.042
Wanna see it?

51:38.406 --> 51:40.684
It wasn't easy to find.

51:41.041 --> 51:44.184
I had to crawl through
the depths of Tartarus itself.

51:45.078 --> 51:47.117
And then Cleveland.

51:47.948 --> 51:50.227
The remains of Kronos.

51:50.418 --> 51:53.425
The original Titan,
father to the Olympians.

51:53.621 --> 51:57.198
And with the Fleece's help,
destroyer of Olympus.

51:57.391 --> 51:58.871
And the world.

51:59.493 --> 52:03.206
You'd destroy the whole world
just to get back at your dad?

52:03.697 --> 52:06.237
The Olympians overthrew their parents.

52:06.767 --> 52:08.373
It's just our turn.

52:08.702 --> 52:10.149
We met your father.

52:10.504 --> 52:13.420
He said that he knows
that he made mistakes.

52:13.607 --> 52:16.250
He told us to tell you
to not be so angry.

52:16.644 --> 52:17.623
Really?

52:19.580 --> 52:21.824
And he couldn't even tell me himself.

52:22.483 --> 52:24.192
Does that sound familiar?

52:25.787 --> 52:27.358
Take them to the brig.

52:27.455 --> 52:28.765
Let's go. Come on.

52:28.857 --> 52:32.000
Thalia was your friend!
She sacrificed herself for you.

52:32.794 --> 52:37.110
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia
when you're hanging around with him?

52:38.667 --> 52:40.979
You disappoint me the most.

53:15.703 --> 53:18.846
I told you he had a brig.

53:24.413 --> 53:25.757
How can you trust him?

53:25.847 --> 53:27.487
He was probably making all that noise
on purpose.

53:27.582 --> 53:29.359
He wanted Luke to catch us.

53:29.551 --> 53:31.829
What do you have against Tyson anyway?

53:31.920 --> 53:33.525
He's a Cyclops.

53:33.722 --> 53:36.604
I think the politically correct term
is "ocularly impaired."

53:36.691 --> 53:39.470
Who cares?
They're vicious and they're dangerous.

53:45.334 --> 53:47.681
Yeah, vicious.

54:07.690 --> 54:09.672
We have to get out of here.

54:09.859 --> 54:11.271
How?

54:17.300 --> 54:19.282
Just hang on to something.

54:50.299 --> 54:52.076
All right, here we go.

54:56.039 --> 54:57.747
Come on, come on, come on!

55:07.784 --> 55:09.128
What's going on?

55:14.490 --> 55:16.369
Percy's trying to kill us.

55:18.562 --> 55:20.065
I think it's working.

55:32.141 --> 55:33.246
You got it?

55:33.443 --> 55:35.447
Piece of cake.

55:35.646 --> 55:37.650
I think I'm gonna vomit.

55:38.282 --> 55:39.261
Yep.

55:40.917 --> 55:42.899
So, how does this work?

55:43.086 --> 55:46.731
I don't know.
It's my first mythical tape gun.

56:05.910 --> 56:07.983
Just like Hermes said...

56:08.779 --> 56:10.055
"instant hole."

56:40.111 --> 56:41.615
Go to the lifeboat.

56:51.856 --> 56:53.565
Kill the engines.

56:59.096 --> 57:01.078
That was for Grover.

57:11.642 --> 57:13.123
Grab him!

57:36.802 --> 57:38.146
We got him!

57:46.712 --> 57:48.158
What are you doing?

57:48.747 --> 57:50.318
Don't walk on my roof.

57:56.154 --> 57:57.794
Join me, Percy.

57:57.989 --> 58:01.668
It's what you were meant to do.
You can't escape that prophecy.

58:02.595 --> 58:04.577
Let's show both of our fathers.

58:05.163 --> 58:06.576
It's tempting.

58:11.103 --> 58:13.552
That's genius. Really.

58:14.273 --> 58:15.844
But I think I'll pass.

58:32.591 --> 58:34.197
Not this again.

58:36.662 --> 58:37.641
Go!

58:37.729 --> 58:40.235
- Are you staying?
- I'll be right behind you.

58:44.470 --> 58:45.780
May as well.

59:20.507 --> 59:21.919
Jackson, enough.

59:26.513 --> 59:28.722
You're on the losing side.

59:29.416 --> 59:31.124
Not from where I stand.

59:49.169 --> 59:50.672
Smart.

59:50.870 --> 59:53.615
Goddess of wisdom's daughter, remember?

59:54.474 --> 59:56.080
I remember.

01:00:04.318 --> 01:00:08.202
Our allies and the satyr still have
a head start on the Fleece.

01:00:09.824 --> 01:00:12.204
We will resurrect you, Lord Kronos.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.999
You will know vengeance.

01:00:16.296 --> 01:00:19.770
And the Olympians who scorned us
will know death.

01:00:38.919 --> 01:00:41.334
Maybe you should reapply.

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:45.033
It wore off?

01:00:46.594 --> 01:00:47.573
Yeah.

01:01:00.841 --> 01:01:02.049
Come on.

01:01:03.878 --> 01:01:05.154
Oh, no.

01:01:10.886 --> 01:01:11.888
Hey.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:14.827
Do you want to steer for a while?

01:01:17.058 --> 01:01:18.367
Thank you.

01:01:19.828 --> 01:01:22.333
Nobody's ever trusted me
with anything before.

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:25.414
Is that because of
your lack of depth perception?

01:01:26.802 --> 01:01:28.977
Is it because they're scared of you?

01:01:32.974 --> 01:01:35.081
I was in the mountains one day...

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:40.821
and some campers,
Boy Scouts, showed up.

01:01:43.585 --> 01:01:47.229
And when they saw me, they screamed.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:50.270
They ran.

01:01:51.993 --> 01:01:54.306
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

01:01:57.098 --> 01:01:59.980
People look at me,
and they see a monster.

01:02:00.702 --> 01:02:03.048
Sometimes, I think maybe they're right.

01:02:05.674 --> 01:02:09.319
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.261
Easy for you to say.

01:02:13.449 --> 01:02:14.758
What do you mean?

01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:18.199
You never doubt yourself
or think you're less than you are.

01:02:22.191 --> 01:02:24.298
Thank you, brother.

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:27.537
Come here. Open it slowly.

01:02:27.729 --> 01:02:28.937
Slowly.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.775
Hey, just take it slow. Slow, okay?

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.892
I wouldn't have trusted him
with a normal thermos.

01:02:44.346 --> 01:02:46.294
He seems okay.

01:02:46.481 --> 01:02:49.260
I really don't get
what your problem with him is.

01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:54.630
Because you don't know
what I know about them.

01:02:55.191 --> 01:02:56.296
Thalia!

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.178
A Cyclops killed her.

01:03:07.504 --> 01:03:09.816
His kind killed Thalia.

01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:12.821
I'm sorry.

01:03:14.244 --> 01:03:15.724
I never knew.

01:03:15.912 --> 01:03:18.486
Well, it's not something
I like talking about.

01:03:19.616 --> 01:03:22.225
And anyway, it was a long time ago.

01:03:32.062 --> 01:03:33.406
What is that?

01:03:34.597 --> 01:03:36.340
It's the Sea of Monsters.

01:03:42.772 --> 01:03:44.344
Why are we stopping?

01:03:47.978 --> 01:03:49.857
I should have used two hands.

01:03:49.947 --> 01:03:51.291
You think?

01:03:52.315 --> 01:03:53.624
Are you mad at me?

01:03:53.717 --> 01:03:55.629
No, not at you.

01:04:12.836 --> 01:04:14.647
Tell me those aren't sharks.

01:04:17.808 --> 01:04:19.483
Those aren't sharks.

01:04:20.411 --> 01:04:22.552
Paddle! Paddle!

01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:29.530
Yeah, sharks would be better.

01:04:44.102 --> 01:04:45.912
It's Charybdis.

01:04:46.104 --> 01:04:47.379
Charyb-... What?

01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.453
She guards the Sea of Monsters.

01:04:55.346 --> 01:04:56.485
Percy!

01:05:03.955 --> 01:05:05.492
It's not working!

01:05:06.457 --> 01:05:09.464
The Sea of Monsters
might not be in Poseidon's domain.

01:05:13.031 --> 01:05:14.010
Hold on!

01:05:53.272 --> 01:05:54.809
Where are we?

01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:58.783
Smells like the stomach.

01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:11.100
Watch your step.

01:06:17.262 --> 01:06:18.902
What is this stuff?

01:06:19.698 --> 01:06:21.680
I don't think you want to know.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.083
This has to be the worst way to die, ever.

01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:29.017
Yeah, everything that disappears
in the Bermuda Triangle...

01:06:29.207 --> 01:06:31.280
this is where they end up.

01:06:32.144 --> 01:06:33.625
Come on!

01:06:34.614 --> 01:06:36.060
That sounded like Clarissa.

01:06:36.148 --> 01:06:37.925
No, it couldn't be her.

01:06:38.117 --> 01:06:40.896
You ridiculously stupid morons.

01:06:41.086 --> 01:06:42.965
- No, it's her.
- It's her.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.539
You idiot!

01:06:48.628 --> 01:06:51.908
Better keep my electric grid up and
running, or I'll plug your head into it!

01:06:51.997 --> 01:06:53.910
Clarissa! Hey!

01:06:56.736 --> 01:06:59.777
Jackson? What are you doing here?

01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:02.079
We got swallowed up, just like you.

01:07:02.275 --> 01:07:03.346
Nice ship.

01:07:03.443 --> 01:07:06.552
My dad's got tons of this stuff
left over from wars throughout history.

01:07:06.646 --> 01:07:11.122
It was either this or a Huey from Vietnam.
I figured a boat would be more practical.

01:07:13.686 --> 01:07:14.995
What's going on?

01:07:15.088 --> 01:07:18.538
Pretty much exactly what you think
goes on inside of a stomach.

01:07:31.771 --> 01:07:33.116
You're right.

01:07:33.306 --> 01:07:35.219
That really is the worst way to die.

01:07:35.308 --> 01:07:36.310
Reardon!

01:07:36.409 --> 01:07:38.892
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?

01:07:38.979 --> 01:07:41.861
Almost, ma'am. They're working on it.

01:07:42.048 --> 01:07:44.656
Wait, your crew is zombies?

01:07:47.187 --> 01:07:48.896
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors

01:07:48.989 --> 01:07:50.937
whose lives have been given
in tribute to Ares."

01:07:51.024 --> 01:07:53.472
But "zombies" is fine.

01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:10.847
Reardon! Gun! Faster! Now!

01:08:11.044 --> 01:08:12.992
Gun is hot, Cap'n. Locked and loaded.

01:08:13.079 --> 01:08:15.061
Aim it at that meat grinder.

01:08:15.248 --> 01:08:17.492
Wait, wait.
You want to shoot that thing with this?

01:08:17.584 --> 01:08:20.727
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.500
Hey, Clarissa.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.296
What?

01:08:27.493 --> 01:08:28.734
Can you steer the ship?

01:08:28.828 --> 01:08:31.642
No. I just finished driver's ed.
Yes, of course, I can steer a ship.

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:33.145
Well...

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.104
why don't we give her a stomach ache?

01:08:35.202 --> 01:08:37.081
We'll escape through the gut.

01:08:37.671 --> 01:08:39.618
It just might work
if it doesn't kill us first.

01:08:39.706 --> 01:08:42.019
You steer, I'll shoot.

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:44.749
All hands below deck!

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.890
Good luck, Percy.

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:56.236
All hands below deck.
This is not a drill!

01:08:56.356 --> 01:08:58.337
Come on, boys. Get in there.

01:09:02.629 --> 01:09:04.234
This is still my quest.

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.675
Do not screw this up for me, Jackson.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.233
You should watch what you eat.

01:09:44.238 --> 01:09:45.218
Go!

01:09:45.407 --> 01:09:46.978
No kidding, genius.

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:00.965
I hope this works.

01:10:03.191 --> 01:10:05.571
- Just don't forget.
- Forget what?

01:10:08.097 --> 01:10:10.101
This is all your idea.

01:10:25.113 --> 01:10:26.491
Come on, come on.

01:10:39.294 --> 01:10:41.470
- We did it!
- I did it!

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.172
Listen up. Full power to the screws.

01:10:45.368 --> 01:10:46.712
Hey. are you guys all right?

01:10:46.802 --> 01:10:48.146
That was amazing.

01:10:52.242 --> 01:10:53.813
You have to have faith, right?

01:10:53.909 --> 01:10:56.392
And a cannon. We'll find Grover.

01:10:58.314 --> 01:10:59.726
Where is lchneutae?

01:10:59.815 --> 01:11:01.387
Now you miss lchneutae?

01:11:01.484 --> 01:11:04.525
We ran into Scylla,
that multi-headed Hydra thing.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.326
He said, "I got this."

01:11:06.522 --> 01:11:07.968
Famous last words.

01:11:08.157 --> 01:11:10.196
We've restored full power, Cap'n.

01:11:10.593 --> 01:11:12.302
- Heading?
- Northwest.

01:11:20.169 --> 01:11:21.808
Are you sure about that?

01:11:21.905 --> 01:11:25.219
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?

01:11:25.408 --> 01:11:27.083
Yeah, you got a problem?

01:11:28.511 --> 01:11:34.195
I think your Confederate warship
is heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

01:11:35.451 --> 01:11:36.430
What is it?

01:11:36.519 --> 01:11:40.027
I know this sounds insane,
but it's kind of like my dyslexia.

01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:44.403
But instead of being able to read Greek,
I can see map lines.

01:11:44.761 --> 01:11:47.677
30. 31, 75,12.

01:11:49.099 --> 01:11:51.411
Wait, that's the numbers from the...

01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:55.245
From the crazy, eyeless taxi drivers.

01:11:55.439 --> 01:11:56.919
They're coordinates.

01:11:57.374 --> 01:11:58.820
Waterboy figured it out.

01:11:58.909 --> 01:12:00.048
And he called you crazy.

01:12:00.143 --> 01:12:01.343
Actually, he called you crazy.

01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:03.221
Hey, eye on the road.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.853
30, 31 degrees north...

01:12:06.416 --> 01:12:08.523
75,12 degrees west.

01:12:08.719 --> 01:12:11.167
That's where
Polyphemus and the Fleece are.

01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:13.601
Change course. Southwest.

01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:15.135
AVE. aye.

01:12:15.492 --> 01:12:16.733
Sorry.

01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:41.064
Land ho!

01:12:44.822 --> 01:12:47.464
Polyphemus lives in an amusement park?

01:12:47.657 --> 01:12:49.434
No, he lives on an island.

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:51.146
But the goddess Circe thought building

01:12:51.195 --> 01:12:53.701
an amusement park on top of it
was a good idea.

01:12:53.798 --> 01:12:55.039
It really wasn't.

01:12:55.132 --> 01:12:56.373
What happened?

01:12:56.968 --> 01:12:58.209
Opening day...

01:12:58.302 --> 01:13:02.482
long lines of savory half-bloods
and one hungry Cyclops.

01:13:03.307 --> 01:13:04.686
Bad for business.

01:13:05.442 --> 01:13:07.253
I'll just turn us right around then.

01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:09.257
Find us a place to dock.

01:13:10.515 --> 01:13:12.690
I was afraid she was gonna say that.

01:13:31.469 --> 01:13:34.453
I guess the Cyclops
was bad for business.

01:13:34.639 --> 01:13:35.846
Who knew?

01:13:37.975 --> 01:13:40.857
We don't have time
to search this whole place.

01:13:43.214 --> 01:13:44.888
I don't think we have to.

01:13:47.318 --> 01:13:49.527
"Plummet of Death"?

01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:51.801
That's subtle.

01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:55.597
It looks like something
really big went through there.

01:13:56.828 --> 01:13:59.869
I don't know.
It doesn't really scream "Cyclops" to me.

01:14:04.102 --> 01:14:05.947
At least there's no line.

01:14:11.843 --> 01:14:13.414
Sweet ride.

01:14:16.514 --> 01:14:17.893
Might need a push.

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.293
Here we go.

01:14:28.427 --> 01:14:30.534
Tyson? Let go of my hand.

01:14:30.729 --> 01:14:31.868
Sorry.

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:38.079
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:41.720
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

01:14:41.907 --> 01:14:44.254
Could you two just shut up?

01:14:48.347 --> 01:14:49.326
Hold on!

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:53.195
Is everybody okay?

01:14:53.285 --> 01:14:55.358
I thought that would be more fun.

01:15:00.926 --> 01:15:03.637
I think I get what Grover
was so worried about.

01:15:05.298 --> 01:15:07.658
This must be the boulder
Polyphemus used to trap Odysseus...

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.240
when he was returning
from the Trojan War.

01:15:10.837 --> 01:15:13.012
Yeah, that's right. I know stuff.

01:15:28.988 --> 01:15:30.195
Grover!

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.996
Enough!

01:15:35.695 --> 01:15:37.802
I can't take this anymore.

01:15:46.139 --> 01:15:47.552
It's been two days!

01:15:47.641 --> 01:15:49.987
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!

01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:54.454
I haven't had a decent meal
since those half-bloods you brought!

01:15:54.648 --> 01:15:57.393
And this stupid fleece
is supposed to lure satyrs!

01:15:57.484 --> 01:15:59.591
Do you see any satyrs around here?

01:16:00.987 --> 01:16:03.937
This hunger is making my eyesight worse.

01:16:04.124 --> 01:16:05.832
I could just eat you.

01:16:08.195 --> 01:16:10.939
If you weren't a Cyclops.

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.145
Grover!

01:16:15.468 --> 01:16:16.447
Grover!

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:18.041
- Hey!
- Come here!

01:16:18.138 --> 01:16:19.117
Percy?

01:16:21.674 --> 01:16:22.653
Hey!

01:16:24.544 --> 01:16:26.287
Why are you wearing a dress?

01:16:26.379 --> 01:16:28.657
I'm having a really bad day!

01:16:28.849 --> 01:16:31.195
Hey, hey, hey!
Do not let that go viral!

01:16:31.385 --> 01:16:33.800
Sorry, there's no way the other kids
would believe me otherwise.

01:16:33.887 --> 01:16:35.299
This is a disguise.

01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:37.962
The guy's half-blind.
He thinks I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.

01:16:38.058 --> 01:16:39.595
I'm showing mad survival skills, here.

01:16:39.694 --> 01:16:41.106
And not a small amount of leg.

01:16:41.195 --> 01:16:42.174
Funny.

01:16:42.262 --> 01:16:45.742
I was trying to stay uneaten long enough to
figure out how to get the Fleece off of him.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:47.211
So, did you?

01:16:47.935 --> 01:16:50.315
Do you think I'd still be
dressed like this if I did?

01:16:50.404 --> 01:16:52.044
It's a good look.

01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:53.241
Thanks, Tyson.

01:16:55.109 --> 01:17:00.463
Clopsies, how about I cook you
something to drink...

01:17:00.648 --> 01:17:02.527
to calm your nerves?

01:17:04.585 --> 01:17:06.658
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:17:07.488 --> 01:17:08.797
Go! Go!

01:17:08.989 --> 01:17:11.734
This fleece used to lure satyrs
every day.

01:17:14.595 --> 01:17:18.342
Now things are so bad,
I even had to eat my own sheep.

01:17:19.099 --> 01:17:20.546
The whole flock!

01:17:21.735 --> 01:17:23.444
They were tender, though.

01:17:24.938 --> 01:17:27.979
Drop me, and I promise
you'll never hear the end of it.

01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:32.650
Do you smell something?

01:17:33.014 --> 01:17:35.257
Smells like half-bloods!

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:41.456
Half-bloods!

01:17:41.555 --> 01:17:43.332
- Get up, quick!
- I was right!

01:17:43.424 --> 01:17:44.928
You stay right there!

01:17:45.026 --> 01:17:46.700
Woman, get a fire going!

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.170
That's not good!

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:49.709
On second thought...

01:17:50.431 --> 01:17:52.379
I'll just eat you raw!

01:17:52.566 --> 01:17:53.545
Hey!

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.251
Hiya!

01:17:57.438 --> 01:17:59.317
My name's Tyson. How are you?

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.518
These guys are my friends...

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.655
so I was hoping, maybe, we could talk.

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:06.125
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.227
You pissant with one eye!

01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:09.920
Hey! Not nice!

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:11.895
You're no Cyclops!

01:18:12.086 --> 01:18:14.398
You're a traitor to your kind!

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:15.864
To be honest...

01:18:17.058 --> 01:18:18.197
Huh? What?

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.335
He's my kind.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:22.377
You disgust me.

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.147
Going somewhere?

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:36.285
I think you've got something of mine.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.452
Annabeth!

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:45.060
Clarissa!

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.642
Get back here, you punk!

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.246
Yo, Clopsies!

01:19:02.338 --> 01:19:04.013
'Quit!

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:07.182
Wait, you're a dude?

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.085
Well, that explains a lot.

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.927
- say goodbye.
.Okay. Goodbye!

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:15.326
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:17.925
Come on! Go, go!

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:20.124
Give me that fleece!

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:30.771
You're dead!

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.609
I'm gonna kill all of you!

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.813
Do you hear me?

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.880
Get back here!

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.595
We rocked that quest.

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:49.323
Yeah, we totally did.

01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:51.762
I didn't know you guys had it in you!

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:53.160
Yes.

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:54.865
Well done.

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:01.041
It's nice work. I really appreciate it.

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.075
I'll take that.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.249
I don't think so.

01:20:10.941 --> 01:20:12.182
Suit yourself.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.034
You'd do it for me.

01:20:32.596 --> 01:20:33.803
No!

01:20:57.954 --> 01:20:59.936
Just remember...

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:02.127
it didn't have to end this way.

01:21:03.494 --> 01:21:05.339
This one's on you.

01:21:11.769 --> 01:21:13.079
Down, boy!

01:21:20.511 --> 01:21:22.754
You should consider yourselves lucky.

01:21:23.347 --> 01:21:25.659
This has been millennia in the making.

01:21:26.484 --> 01:21:28.261
And you all get to see it.

01:21:28.887 --> 01:21:30.869
You used to be one of us!

01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:34.330
And then I woke up.

01:21:38.996 --> 01:21:42.675
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.

01:21:44.836 --> 01:21:46.111
Percy.

01:21:47.672 --> 01:21:49.550
I never called him "brother."

01:21:51.576 --> 01:21:53.990
All he ever wanted was a brother...

01:21:55.313 --> 01:21:57.887
but I was too wrapped up in myself.

01:21:59.818 --> 01:22:02.461
And now Luke has the Fleece...

01:22:02.654 --> 01:22:04.795
because I gave it to him.

01:22:06.491 --> 01:22:10.705
I destroy Olympus,
just like the Oracle said.

01:22:12.730 --> 01:22:14.108
Forget the Oracle.

01:22:15.767 --> 01:22:18.876
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

01:22:19.937 --> 01:22:23.946
You're angry at Poseidon for ignoring you?
Then show him why he shouldn't.

01:22:24.476 --> 01:22:26.458
You're upset about Tyson?

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.062
Then make sure
he didn't die for nothing.

01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:31.857
She's right.

01:22:34.386 --> 01:22:35.525
What?

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.431
There's no way
you're getting me to repeat that.

01:22:39.959 --> 01:22:41.998
What Annabeth is saying, Perce...

01:22:42.094 --> 01:22:44.372
is that we're with you.

01:22:44.562 --> 01:22:46.271
Just give the word.

01:22:46.664 --> 01:22:48.077
Why me?

01:22:48.666 --> 01:22:50.477
I mean, who voted me leader?

01:23:04.249 --> 01:23:08.167
Lord Kronos,
he who was betrayed by his sons...

01:23:08.353 --> 01:23:11.269
hear now the words
of one betrayed by his father.

01:23:11.456 --> 01:23:14.065
I bid you... rise.

01:23:52.798 --> 01:23:53.777
Grover!

01:23:55.568 --> 01:23:56.547
Hands.

01:23:57.037 --> 01:24:00.283
Try not to cut them off.
I'm pretty attached to them.

01:24:19.693 --> 01:24:21.606
I have to get to the Fleece.

01:24:21.795 --> 01:24:23.777
So, what are we supposed to do?

01:24:25.732 --> 01:24:27.110
Right.

01:24:55.695 --> 01:24:58.201
I know you can breathe under water,
Jackson.

01:24:58.332 --> 01:25:00.245
But can you breathe like this?

01:25:10.744 --> 01:25:11.883
Hi, Brother!

01:25:25.459 --> 01:25:26.495
What the...?

01:25:26.593 --> 01:25:27.767
The water.

01:25:29.296 --> 01:25:30.743
It healed me.

01:25:32.867 --> 01:25:34.712
Son of Poseidon.

01:25:39.607 --> 01:25:40.882
Thank you...

01:25:42.577 --> 01:25:43.955
Brother.

01:26:07.969 --> 01:26:09.279
He rises.

01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:27.896
Master!

01:26:28.089 --> 01:26:29.694
I brought you back!

01:26:38.834 --> 01:26:40.610
My Lord!

01:26:40.802 --> 01:26:41.873
It's Luke!

01:26:42.437 --> 01:26:43.941
Luke Castellan!

01:26:44.672 --> 01:26:46.780
Your great-grandson!

01:26:48.009 --> 01:26:49.614
My favorite.

01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:37.631
Grover!

01:28:13.062 --> 01:28:14.941
It's the cursed blade!

01:28:16.633 --> 01:28:18.512
"...cursed blade shall reap."

01:28:45.728 --> 01:28:48.177
You want to know
who gave me this sword?

01:28:49.266 --> 01:28:52.273
The god that killed you with it
in the first place!

01:28:55.572 --> 01:28:56.916
My father.

01:28:58.075 --> 01:28:59.612
Percy Jackson...

01:28:59.809 --> 01:29:02.418
your destiny was written long ago.

01:29:04.781 --> 01:29:05.853
No!

01:29:09.086 --> 01:29:11.227
I make my own destiny.

01:29:47.825 --> 01:29:48.998
Half-blood!

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.341
Just in time for dinner.

01:30:17.121 --> 01:30:18.328
Thanks, Dad.

01:30:20.959 --> 01:30:22.268
Percy.

01:30:30.034 --> 01:30:31.378
Annabeth!

01:30:34.906 --> 01:30:35.885
Grover!

01:30:59.264 --> 01:31:00.404
Annabeth!

01:31:03.234 --> 01:31:04.476
No, no!

01:31:04.836 --> 01:31:07.479
At least I'll be with Thalia in Elysium.

01:31:07.939 --> 01:31:09.852
Come here. Give me the Fleece!

01:31:10.108 --> 01:31:11.453
Come on! Come on.

01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:12.589
Come on.

01:31:14.779 --> 01:31:18.697
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.

01:31:18.884 --> 01:31:20.365
I have faith in you.

01:31:23.922 --> 01:31:26.769
No, no. Come on, show me.

01:31:27.692 --> 01:31:28.933
Show me.

01:31:30.596 --> 01:31:31.905
Come on.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.636
Annie.

01:32:14.173 --> 01:32:15.483
What happened?

01:32:16.275 --> 01:32:17.381
Don't worry about it.

01:32:17.477 --> 01:32:19.891
If anyone else wants to die tonight...

01:32:20.079 --> 01:32:22.118
at least we have this.

01:32:23.749 --> 01:32:26.129
Hey. You're alive.

01:32:26.986 --> 01:32:28.399
Yeah.

01:32:29.155 --> 01:32:31.468
What you did for Percy...

01:32:33.025 --> 01:32:35.304
that was not so vicious and dangerous.

01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:39.111
Thanks.

01:32:39.866 --> 01:32:40.845
No.

01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:42.776
Thank you.

01:32:54.014 --> 01:32:54.993
You know what, Tyson?

01:32:55.081 --> 01:32:57.757
I know a lot of campers with two eyes
who couldn't do what you did.

01:32:57.851 --> 01:32:59.890
- Hey, Clarissa.
- What?

01:33:00.087 --> 01:33:02.501
Come on, big guy.
We get back to camp, the nectar's on me.

01:33:02.588 --> 01:33:04.263
Have you met the nymphs?

01:33:04.992 --> 01:33:06.472
This was your quest.

01:33:07.527 --> 01:33:11.138
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:33:11.331 --> 01:33:13.540
I think you should
be the one who gets to...

01:33:13.634 --> 01:33:15.308
do the honors.

01:33:31.652 --> 01:33:33.759
Here you go, Thalia.

01:34:46.661 --> 01:34:50.237
Clarissa! Clarissa! Clarissa!

01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:57.145
Nectar?

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:00.176
If you haven't had...

01:35:00.275 --> 01:35:01.778
you haven't lived.

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:08.223
You know what?

01:35:09.617 --> 01:35:11.656
You don't need these anymore.

01:35:13.288 --> 01:35:14.791
There, that's better.

01:35:29.338 --> 01:35:30.613
<i>You seem happy.</i>

01:35:31.139 --> 01:35:34.852
I'm just relieved to have that whole
prophecy thing off my shoulders.

01:35:35.043 --> 01:35:37.651
I'm not altogether sure it is, Percy.

01:35:37.846 --> 01:35:41.923
You've done wonderfully, but you are
still the only living human child...

01:35:42.117 --> 01:35:44.395
of Poseidon, Hades, or Zeus.

01:35:44.586 --> 01:35:45.999
Besides...

01:35:46.188 --> 01:35:48.466
it's quite possible
the Oracle wasn't referring

01:35:48.558 --> 01:35:51.234
to what would unfold
on Polyphemus' island.

01:35:51.426 --> 01:35:54.342
I'm just saying, a lot can happen
between now and your 20th birthday.

01:35:54.429 --> 01:35:56.411
That's not really what I meant.

01:35:56.532 --> 01:36:00.176
What I meant was
finding out you have a destiny...

01:36:00.369 --> 01:36:03.946
is a lot like finding out you have
a half-brother who's a Cyclops.

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:06.583
It might not be as bad as you think.

01:36:19.522 --> 01:36:22.131
Percy! Percy!

01:36:23.259 --> 01:36:24.568
Percy!

01:36:24.927 --> 01:36:27.706
Annabeth was guarding the tree
last night...

01:36:27.897 --> 01:36:29.503
and something happened.

01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:32.738
Percy.

01:36:33.369 --> 01:36:35.009
- The Fleece!
- What happened?

01:36:35.105 --> 01:36:37.678
It was even more powerful
than we thought.

01:36:57.393 --> 01:36:58.772
Come on, help her.

01:37:00.596 --> 01:37:01.770
Who are you?

01:37:02.766 --> 01:37:05.112
Percy.
Everything's all right, it's okay.

01:37:05.534 --> 01:37:06.981
I had the strangest dream.

01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:08.049
Yeah?

01:37:08.137 --> 01:37:10.016
Like I was dying.

01:37:10.406 --> 01:37:11.751
What's your name?

01:37:12.876 --> 01:37:16.019
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.

01:37:18.749 --> 01:37:21.733
<i>Another living child of the eldest gods.</i>

01:37:24.588 --> 01:37:26.797
<i>Maybe it wasn't me.</i>

01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:29.803
<i>Maybe the Oracle meant Thalia all along.</i>

01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:33.607
<i>Could she be our salvation?</i>

01:37:33.997 --> 01:37:36.412
<i>Or the cause of our destruction?</i>

01:37:37.305 --> 01:37:43.588
