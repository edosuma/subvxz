WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.237
SPIKE: I can't bite anything.
 I can't even hit people.

00:03.270 --> 00:06.040
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
 I've got information

00:06.073 --> 00:08.842
about the soldier boys
you were fighting.

00:08.875 --> 00:09.977
I'm going.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.679
Well, how long?

00:11.711 --> 00:13.080
OZ:
 I don't know.

00:13.114 --> 00:16.484
The wolf is inside me,
 all the time.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.885
Until I figure out
 what that means,

00:17.917 --> 00:19.952
I shouldn't be around you.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.129
*

00:53.154 --> 00:55.588
(inhales)

01:01.060 --> 01:03.463
(indistinct chatter)

01:05.599 --> 01:07.968
WOMAN: Yeah.
That looks good.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.870
WOMAN 2:
I think it might...
It's not straight.

01:10.903 --> 01:12.406
One second. Almost finished.
Flip it over.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.141
Oh, right. Okay.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.444
Yeah, just unhook it.
Okay. And let me
flip it over.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.445
Yeah, perfect.
Right on.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.912
No, that's it.
It looks good.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.049
Thanks, Riley.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.453
It looks good.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.787
Oh. Hey, Buffy.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.823
Is there something
you want to tell me?

01:29.856 --> 01:31.158
What?

01:32.192 --> 01:33.561
Oh.
(chuckles)

01:33.593 --> 01:36.063
Yes. I am a lesbian.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.930
Well, it's good
that you're so open about it.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.168
Oh, hey,
you know we were talkin'

01:40.200 --> 01:42.670
about havin' a picnic?
I was thinkin',

01:42.703 --> 01:45.573
do you ever hang out
at Ruggs Field?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.408
It's beautiful
there.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.676
Usually not
that crowded either.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.179
I thought maybe
we could have a little spread--

01:51.212 --> 01:54.081
sandwiches, maybe some ants.
Could be fun.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.084
We were talking
about having a picnic?
Oh.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.420
So, was that
a conversation

01:59.453 --> 02:02.423
we actually had
or one I was just practicing?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.158
Practicing?

02:04.192 --> 02:06.659
Okay. Yes, I have been known

02:06.694 --> 02:08.627
to do a little prep work
before our conversations.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.199
It's not easy, you know,
talkin' to you sometimes.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.866
It's like an oral exam.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.868
Boy.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.705
That's just what
every girl longs to hear.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.207
Well, you're tricky.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.808
Like an exam?

02:21.841 --> 02:25.111
I never know how
you're gonna react to something.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.514
That's why I like you so much.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.550
You're a mystery.

02:29.582 --> 02:32.051
(scoffs)
Probably every beautiful girl
in the world

02:32.085 --> 02:34.322
has some jerk tellin' her
she's a mystery, but...

02:34.354 --> 02:37.724
I swear... you really are.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.528
There's a lot about you
that needs puzzling out.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.201
I lose you somewhere?

02:49.236 --> 02:53.073
Right around... "beautiful."

02:54.408 --> 02:58.010
Say, don't you just love
a picnic?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.013
It's just... different,
you know?

03:00.046 --> 03:01.581
A picnic.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.082
First of all, daylight.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.252
That's kind of a new venue,
Buffy-wise.

03:05.286 --> 03:08.021
And the best part-- he said that
he would bring all the food,

03:08.055 --> 03:10.424
so all I have to do
is show up and eat.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.259
Those are two things
I'm really good at.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.926
So, he's nice?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.763
Very, very.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.431
And there's sparkage?

03:17.465 --> 03:19.866
Yeah. He's...

03:19.900 --> 03:21.534
Have you seen his arms?

03:21.568 --> 03:24.737
Those are...
good arms to have.

03:24.771 --> 03:28.008
I really like him. I do.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.843
But?

03:30.877 --> 03:33.247
I don't know.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.682
I really like being
around him, you know?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.085
And I think he
cares about me.

03:38.117 --> 03:41.288
But... I just...

03:41.322 --> 03:43.424
feel like something's missing.

03:43.456 --> 03:46.593
He's not making you miserable?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.430
Exactly.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.098
Riley seems so solid,

03:52.132 --> 03:56.036
like... he wouldn't
cause me heartache.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.272
Get out. Get out
while there's still time.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.775
I know.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.777
I have to get away from
that "bad boy" thing.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.480
There's no good there.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.284
Seeing Angel in L.A.,

04:11.318 --> 04:13.954
even for five minutes,

04:13.986 --> 04:16.223
hello to the pain.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.392
The pain is not a friend.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.394
But I can't help thinking,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.130
isn't that where
the fire comes from?

04:24.163 --> 04:28.802
Can a nice, safe relationship
be that intense?

04:28.836 --> 04:32.473
I know it's nuts,
but part of me believes

04:32.505 --> 04:34.574
that real love and passion

04:34.608 --> 04:38.077
have to go hand in hand
with pain and fighting.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.312
(snarling)

04:41.949 --> 04:44.718
I wonder
where I get that from.

04:47.053 --> 04:50.156
(wolf howling)

04:50.189 --> 04:52.292
*

05:40.374 --> 05:42.341
So, you saw their faces,

05:42.375 --> 05:45.678
but you can't describe them.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.081
Well... they were human.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.884
Two eyes each,
kind of in the middle.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.853
Uh-huh. And the lab?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.355
Underground.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.057
I came out through an air vent.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.324
I don't know exactly where.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.226
I'm done.

06:00.259 --> 06:01.629
Put the telly on.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.966
It's about time.
Hope you got it warm enough.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.269
(sighs)

06:10.302 --> 06:13.440
(groans softly)

06:13.473 --> 06:15.675
(sighs)

06:15.709 --> 06:17.944
(slurping)

06:20.279 --> 06:22.550
Don't know why you're so
dainty all of a sudden.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.884
You've done this for
Angel. You must have.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.353
Okay.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.286
Hey! Give it!

06:27.319 --> 06:28.387
That's it.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.057
The invalid
amnesiac routine is over.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.060
The kitchen is closed until
you can tell me something useful

06:33.093 --> 06:34.360
about the commandos.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.596
I'm trying to remember.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.096
It was very traumatic.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.598
How long
are you gonna pull this crap?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.733
How long am I gonna live
once I tell you?

06:40.768 --> 06:43.737
Spike, w-we have
no intention of killing,

06:43.771 --> 06:45.439
a harmless, um, creature.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.441
But we-we have to know
what's been done to you.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.442
We-we can't let you go
until we're sure

06:49.476 --> 06:50.744
that you're-you're
impotent

06:50.778 --> 06:51.944
or...
Hey.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.781
Sorry. Poor choice
of words.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.115
Until we know
that you're-you're...
Flaccid?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.250
You are one step away, missy.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.920
Giles, help. He's
gonna scold me.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.790
(grunts)
You know what?

07:03.824 --> 07:05.091
(sighs)

07:05.125 --> 07:09.329
I don't think
you want us to let you go.

07:09.362 --> 07:12.800
Maybe we made it a little
too comfy in here for you.
Comfy?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.802
I'm chained in a bathtub,
drinking pig's blood

07:14.834 --> 07:16.569
from a novelty mug.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.072
Doesn't rate huge
in the Zagat's guide.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.641
You want something nicer?

07:21.675 --> 07:25.144
Look at my poor neck,

07:25.177 --> 07:27.648
all bare and tender

07:27.680 --> 07:30.149
and exposed.

07:30.182 --> 07:32.084
All that blood,

07:32.119 --> 07:35.656
just pumping away.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.824
Oh, please.
Giles, make her stop.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.827
If those two
don't kill each other,

07:40.860 --> 07:43.262
I might lend a hand.

07:43.295 --> 07:45.966
What about a truth spell?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.334
I'm not positive
it would work on a vampire,

07:48.367 --> 07:49.502
but we could try.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.672
Make him fess up.
A truth spell.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.606
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

07:53.641 --> 07:55.341
'Cause you had
your hands full

07:55.375 --> 07:56.776
with the undead English Patient?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.612
Yes.
Worth a go.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.781
Looks pretty simple. I'll
stop by the magic shop tomorrow.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.684
Excellent.
All right.

08:03.716 --> 08:07.987
I'll be back in the morning
with doughnuts and motherwort.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.358
Bye, Buffy!
I'll see you at home!
Bye!

08:12.391 --> 08:14.827
Great. Thank you, Willow.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.831
(slurping)

08:18.865 --> 08:23.571
Um, Willow may have had
a very helpful idea.

08:23.603 --> 08:26.906
She seems to be coping better
with Oz's departure,

08:26.939 --> 08:28.175
don't you think?

08:28.207 --> 08:31.011
Well, she still has
a way to go, but...

08:31.043 --> 08:33.013
yeah, I think
she's dealing.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.081
What, are you people blind?

08:35.115 --> 08:37.250
She's hangin' on
by a thread.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.852
Any ninny can see that.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.288
*

09:02.308 --> 09:05.879
WILLOW:
 Devon said
 that he sent for his stuff.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.716
I... (sighs)
I guess this means

09:08.749 --> 09:11.951
he's planning
on settling down somewhere...

09:11.985 --> 09:13.721
else.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.889
Not here.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.260
I guess so.

09:21.293 --> 09:24.865
I feel like I've been split
down the center

09:24.898 --> 09:28.969
and half of me is lost.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.403
I know.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.941
It feels like that now.

09:35.174 --> 09:38.912
Oz is gone.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.549
(birds chirping)

09:43.582 --> 09:45.885
(dog barking in distance)

09:45.918 --> 09:48.388
(grunting)

09:48.421 --> 09:50.790
Come on, now! It's telly time!

09:50.823 --> 09:53.125
(recorded):
Hey, this is Buffy and Willow.
We're not in right now,

09:53.159 --> 09:56.129
so please leave a message.
Oh, uh, Willow, uh, it's Giles.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.131
Um, I-I thought you were
bringing the ingredients

09:59.165 --> 10:02.469
for that spell.
I really have to...
 Passions is on!

10:02.501 --> 10:04.738
Timmy's down
a bloody well!

10:04.772 --> 10:06.572
And if you make me miss it,
I'll...

10:06.605 --> 10:08.808
You'll do what,
lick me to death?

10:08.841 --> 10:11.278
(grunts)

10:13.681 --> 10:15.481
Look, uh, Willow,

10:15.514 --> 10:17.484
I think we ought
to try the spell.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.486
Among other things, I'd like
to shower sometime today.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.755
Alone.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.024
(sighs)

10:24.057 --> 10:25.192
Driving.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.027
Yeah.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.697
You seriously drive for fun?

10:29.730 --> 10:32.131
Well, not four-wheeling
or anything but yeah.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.866
Don't you?

10:33.900 --> 10:36.870
Actually, no-wheeling
is more my specialty.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.706
I'm an avid
pedestrian though.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.673
You're kidding, right?

10:40.707 --> 10:42.842
I mean, you know how to drive.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.510
Well, I took the class.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.846
Cars and Buffy are like...

10:46.879 --> 10:48.514
unmix-y things.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.217
Just because you haven't
had a good experience yet.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.220
You can have
the best time in a car.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.488
It's
not about getting somewhere.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.224
You have to take your time,

10:57.256 --> 10:59.225
forget about everything.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.028
You just relax,

11:01.061 --> 11:02.629
let it wash
over you--

11:02.662 --> 11:06.133
the air,
motion.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.201
Just let it roll.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.472
We are talking about driving,
right?

11:13.505 --> 11:16.676
I thought I was.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.148
I'm taking you.
(chuckles)

11:21.181 --> 11:23.649
Some night when it's warm.
Past the vineyards.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.253
It's gonna change everything
for you.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.456
I'm in.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.961
Hey, Willow.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.429
Hey.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.865
I interrupted.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.533
You've got apples.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.837
My mist.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.706
Wait.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.841
Sit.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.277
There's plenty to go around.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.711
(bell tolling in distance)

11:54.147 --> 11:57.549
Did something happen?
Is something wrong?
No.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.552
Everything's fine. Same.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.222
Oh.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.225
Your apples are turning brown.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.760
The way they do.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.461
Yeah.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.398
Yeah. I guess they do that.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.134
Yeah.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.570
Yeah.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.777
*
(indistinct chatter)

12:26.745 --> 12:29.448
Geez. You mean Oz
just sent for his stuff

12:29.481 --> 12:31.283
and didn't even call her?

12:31.317 --> 12:33.720
That's pretty harsh.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.054
I only wish
I had my powers back.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.789
I'd liquefy
his entrails for her.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.826
XANDER:
That's sweet.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.260
God. Poor Will.

12:41.293 --> 12:42.796
No wonder she's...

12:42.830 --> 12:45.331
* Your ride

12:45.365 --> 12:47.399
...having a wonderful time.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.671
* I know, you'll be at...

12:51.703 --> 12:53.907
Wow. Way to rebound.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.775
I believe that's the dance
of a brave little toaster.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.011
* Commiserating

12:59.046 --> 13:02.448
* Say it ain't so,
I will not go *

13:02.481 --> 13:04.183
* Turn the lights off...

13:04.216 --> 13:07.754
Hey, guys, come on.
This music's great.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.423
It's nice to see you brought
your boogie shoes tonight, Will.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.259
Yeah. You know, I-I know

13:12.292 --> 13:14.260
I've been
sort of a party poop lately,

13:14.293 --> 13:16.929
so I said to myself,
"Self," I said,

13:16.963 --> 13:19.599
"it's time to shake
and shimmy it off."

13:19.631 --> 13:21.268
Sounds like a good policy.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.269
Yeah, and-and it works, too.
You know,

13:23.302 --> 13:26.038
I just figure in the...
in the grand scheme of things,

13:26.072 --> 13:27.206
we're all just...

13:27.240 --> 13:28.207
(clinking)

13:30.476 --> 13:32.544
Drunk?

13:32.578 --> 13:34.780
(sputters)
"Drunk."

13:34.813 --> 13:36.283
I mean, that's...

13:36.316 --> 13:38.618
that's such a-a strong word.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.955
Kind of a guttural
Anglo-Saxon word.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.690
"Drunk."
Will,

13:43.722 --> 13:46.125
not loving the drowning
of the sorrows.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.128
Not drowning. Waiting.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.798
Uh, see? Light. No big.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.801
No big? Anybody remember
when Buffy had the fun beer fest

13:54.834 --> 13:56.735
and went one million years BC?

13:56.769 --> 13:58.738
Sadly, without
the fuzzy bikini.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.506
Off topic, Xander.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.341
Right. Helping now.

14:02.375 --> 14:06.413
Will, how about you
give me that beer?
No.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.847
Why should I?
I-I've got pain here,

14:08.881 --> 14:11.018
big-time, legitimate pain.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.086
We all have pain, Will.
Oh,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.822
like what? "Oh, poor me.
I live in a basement."

14:15.855 --> 14:17.590
Yeah, that's dire.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.427
BUFFY:
Okay. You know what?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.395
That's it. I'm
taking you home.
No, I don't want to.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.065
Well, you'll thank me
when you still have a friend

14:25.097 --> 14:26.099
in the morning.

14:27.866 --> 14:31.071
I just can't stand feeling
this way.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.072
I want it to be over.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.741
It will. I promise.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.844
But it's gonna take time.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.279
Well, that's not good enough.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.948
I know.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.951
It's just how it is.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.784
You have to go through the pain.

14:45.817 --> 14:49.556
Well, isn't there some way
I can just make it go away?

14:49.588 --> 14:51.057
Just 'cause I say so?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.759
Can't-can't
I just make it go poof?

14:55.727 --> 14:58.097
(squeaking)

15:29.461 --> 15:31.264
Hearken well, ye elements.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.932
I summon thee now.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.302
Control the outside,

15:35.335 --> 15:37.836
control within.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.073
Land and sea, fire and wind,

15:41.107 --> 15:43.976
out of my passions,
a web be spun.

15:44.010 --> 15:48.014
From this eve forth,
my will be done.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.183
So mote it be.

15:51.217 --> 15:55.187
(lightning crashing)

16:06.966 --> 16:10.503
It is my will
that my heart be healed.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.739
Now.

16:15.475 --> 16:20.312
I will that this book
speak its words to me.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.287
I will
that this Q-tip gets... unbendy?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.888
(knocking)

16:28.921 --> 16:30.356
Come in.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.493
Giles.

16:33.525 --> 16:34.826
What are you doin' here?

16:34.860 --> 16:37.697
I'm a bit concerned
about you, actually.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.200
Did Buffy tell you
about the beer? 'Cause...

16:40.232 --> 16:42.201
Uh, Buffy didn't tell me
anything.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.671
Oh. Well, forget
the beer part then.

16:44.703 --> 16:48.307
Happily. I came because we had
an appointment the other day.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.677
Oh, r-right. The truth spell.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.013
Yes. Um... Willow...

16:54.047 --> 16:56.082
I know that you're...

16:56.115 --> 16:58.750
going though
a very difficult time.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.687
But shirking
your responsibilities...

17:00.720 --> 17:03.690
But I didn't... shirk.

17:03.722 --> 17:08.661
I did the research
and-and I-I picked up

17:08.694 --> 17:10.230
the motherwort.
I just forgot

17:10.262 --> 17:12.199
the doing-the-spell part.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.000
That isn't like you at all.

17:14.031 --> 17:17.237
I know. I-I've been off.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.006
I... I even tried to do
a spell last night.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.209
To have
my will done?

17:22.241 --> 17:24.943
I was hoping
it would make me feel better.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.779
But it just went kablooey.
A spell?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.449
I don't think it's wise for you
to be doing that alone

17:29.481 --> 17:31.451
right now.
Your energy's too unfocused.

17:31.483 --> 17:35.721
That's not true. I s... I said
I was off, not incompetent.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.390
I only meant
that you're grieving, and it...

17:37.423 --> 17:39.057
it might be wise
if you took a break

17:39.092 --> 17:41.528
from doing spells
without supervision.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.930
So I get punished
'cause I'm in pain?

17:43.962 --> 17:45.698
It's not punishment.
I'm only saying this because...

17:45.731 --> 17:47.366
Oh, you care.
Yeah.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.768
Everybody cares,

17:48.800 --> 17:52.105
but nobody wants
to be inconvenienced.

17:52.138 --> 17:55.375
You all want me to take the time
and go through the pain

17:55.407 --> 17:58.044
as long as you don't have
to hear about it anymore.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.046
That's not fair.
Isn't it?

18:00.078 --> 18:01.647
'Cause I'm doing the best I can,

18:01.681 --> 18:03.883
and it doesn't seem
to be enough for you guys.

18:03.915 --> 18:07.453
And I see how
you could feel that way. I do...

18:07.487 --> 18:08.454
No, you don't.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.756
You say
that you do,

18:09.788 --> 18:12.224
but you don't see anything.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.461
Um...

18:14.493 --> 18:16.462
Ooh. Sorry.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.397
Um...

18:18.431 --> 18:21.401
Sorry. Um, p-perhaps

18:21.433 --> 18:22.634
I'd better
be going.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.971
Um, let's, um...

18:25.003 --> 18:27.673
let's talk
about this later.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.813
Oh! Sorry.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.448
So sorry.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.753
GILES:
"Enemy, enemy,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.655
be now quiet."

18:43.690 --> 18:45.090
You know,

18:45.124 --> 18:47.594
I'm not too keen
about this spell stuff.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.596
Tends to be
a bit unpredictable.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.530
You might have thought
about that sooner.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.599
Um...

18:53.633 --> 18:56.269
"Let your deceitful
tongue be..."

18:56.302 --> 18:59.005
(scoffs)

18:59.038 --> 19:01.807
"Be...
broken."

19:01.840 --> 19:06.179
Uh, "Let no...

19:06.212 --> 19:08.980
"untruths...

19:09.015 --> 19:11.317
be spoken."
(sighs)

19:15.153 --> 19:16.855
Hey.

19:16.888 --> 19:18.290
What's that
all about?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.726
Hmm? Oh, nothing.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.894
Just, um, you know,
a-ash in my eye.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.498
Well,

19:25.531 --> 19:28.134
I won't have you
doin' mojo on me

19:28.166 --> 19:29.701
if you can't read properly.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.471
You could turn me
into a stink beetle or what all.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.342
That would be a generous ending
for you, Spike.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.442
(click, jangling)

19:37.844 --> 19:39.546
(shouts)

19:42.682 --> 19:43.883
(squeaking)

19:43.915 --> 19:46.318
I mean, I'm going through
something,

19:46.353 --> 19:49.322
I just don't see
why he was getting down on me.

19:49.355 --> 19:53.326
Giles just worries.
Spells can be dangerous.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.362
Doesn't mean he thinks
that you're a bad witch.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.930
I am a bad witch.
No,

19:57.963 --> 19:59.499
you're a good witch.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.234
I'm not kidding anyone.
If I had any real power,

20:02.269 --> 20:04.737
I could've made Oz stay with me.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.838
Will, you wouldn't have
wanted him to have stayed...

20:06.873 --> 20:10.442
And I didn't have the guts
to do the spell on Veruca.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.380
And my "I will it so" spell
went nowhere.

20:13.413 --> 20:17.717
The only real witch here
Is fuzzy little Amy.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.586
(squeaking)

20:19.618 --> 20:21.753
I think you're being too hard
on yourself.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.856
She's got access to powers
I can't even invoke.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.858
I mean, first
she's a perfectly

20:26.893 --> 20:27.859
normal girl.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.096
Then, poof,
she's a rat.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.400
I could

20:33.432 --> 20:35.434
never do something like that.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.868
(phone rings)

20:36.903 --> 20:39.070
(sighs)

20:39.105 --> 20:40.339
Hello?

20:42.342 --> 20:43.910
(groans)

20:43.942 --> 20:45.478
I'll be right there.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.778
Spike escaped.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.615
And you're going?

20:48.647 --> 20:49.949
Now?

20:49.981 --> 20:53.219
Sorry. Duty thing.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.755
Well, I mean, what's the rush?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.324
Spike can't hurt
anyone, right?

20:57.356 --> 21:00.226
And I figured
since I'm kind of grieve-y,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.628
we could, uh, you know,
have a girls' night,

21:02.662 --> 21:05.432
you know, eat sundaes
and watch Steel Magnolias

21:05.464 --> 21:09.769
and you can tell me how at least
I don't have diabetes.
Will,

21:09.801 --> 21:12.939
I can't hang out with you
until I get Spike back
to Giles. You know that.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.307
Okay, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.742
I promise.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.412
I don't see the big.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.413
He's probably just standing
out there.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.115
You'll find him in two seconds.

21:26.117 --> 21:27.787
(scoffs)

21:27.819 --> 21:30.823
I thought
that was gonna take longer.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.090
Me, too.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.093
I must've got...

21:34.125 --> 21:37.096
turned around.

21:37.128 --> 21:39.499
Hang-hang on. This...

21:39.531 --> 21:41.500
this is it.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.801
Wait.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.271
No. Yes.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.339
What are you talking about?

21:47.374 --> 21:50.209
The lab. Commando lab.

21:50.241 --> 21:53.211
The door was right
here where I escaped.

21:53.244 --> 21:54.480
I don't think so.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.117
Open up!

21:59.151 --> 22:01.488
I'm gonna kill you!
Spike,

22:01.520 --> 22:03.221
there's nothing there.
Let me in!

22:03.255 --> 22:05.657
Fix me.
Okay,

22:05.692 --> 22:06.992
drop the act.
Get off me!

22:07.026 --> 22:09.228
Okay, that's it.
I'm gonna gag you.

22:09.260 --> 22:10.162
Oh!

22:10.195 --> 22:12.765
(moaning)

22:20.573 --> 22:22.307
Hey! Watch it!

22:22.340 --> 22:25.144
One more word out of you,
and I swear...
Swear what?

22:25.176 --> 22:27.680
You're not gonna do anything
to me.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.182
You don't have
the stones.
Oh, I got the stones.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.519
I got a whole bunch of...

22:32.551 --> 22:35.086
stones.
Yeah?

22:35.121 --> 22:36.556
You're all talk.

22:36.588 --> 22:37.990
Giles!

22:38.023 --> 22:39.892
I accidentally killed Spike!

22:39.925 --> 22:41.894
That's okay, right?!

22:41.927 --> 22:44.497
Um... just a minute.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.332
I mean,
I'm going through something,

22:46.365 --> 22:48.067
and you'd think
every once in a while

22:48.099 --> 22:50.502
Buffy would make
best friends a priority.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.573
You know, Will, it's not like
she could just let Spike go.

22:53.605 --> 22:54.874
(panting)

22:54.906 --> 22:57.242
I get this
spell reversed,

22:57.276 --> 22:59.412
they'll be finding
your body for weeks.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.513
Oh, make a move.

23:01.548 --> 23:06.352
Please. I'm dying
for a good slay.

23:06.384 --> 23:09.121
Spike's more important than me.
I get it.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.222
But Buffy's got to find out
what's up with those commandos.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.125
Right now, she needs Spike.

23:13.159 --> 23:17.229
Well, fine. Why doesn't
she just go marry him?

23:17.262 --> 23:20.633
If the two of you
could remain... civil

23:20.666 --> 23:23.402
long enough to...
(stammers)

23:23.435 --> 23:25.403
It's just so sudden.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.707
I-I don't know what to say.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.541
Just say yes

23:29.576 --> 23:32.479
and make me
the happiest man on earth.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.813
Oh, Spike.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.015
Of course it's yes!

23:43.789 --> 23:48.094
Giles! You'll never believe
what's happened!

23:56.868 --> 23:58.837
It's just not fair.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.106
Will, I know it's hard
to see it right now,

24:01.140 --> 24:04.175
but everything you're feeling
is because of you and Oz,

24:04.210 --> 24:07.145
not because of Buffy
and me or anybody.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.580
But eventually
you'll meet somebody else,

24:08.615 --> 24:10.482
and it'll be better.
Yeah,

24:10.517 --> 24:13.486
'cause most relationships
are great and trouble-free.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.153
I don't think so.

24:15.186 --> 24:16.655
I think we're all doomed
to badness.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.625
We're not doomed.
Oh, yeah? Let's...

24:19.659 --> 24:21.827
let's look at your bio.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.631
Insect lady,
mummy girl,

24:24.663 --> 24:26.633
Anya. You're a...

24:26.665 --> 24:28.634
demon
magnet.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.836
Hey, I was just trying to help.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.838
Willow, it's-it's me.

24:32.872 --> 24:36.275
(sighs)
Something's happened.
I-I need your help.

24:36.307 --> 24:38.545
I-I can't see very well.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.547
E-Everything's blurred.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.715
I-I'm certain it's-it's a spell
of s-some kind,

24:43.750 --> 24:46.719
because, um...
(chuckles) well, it-it...

24:46.752 --> 24:49.888
it seems... something else

24:49.922 --> 24:51.624
is going wrong.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.492
Here you go. 98.6.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.565
Horribly wrong.

24:58.597 --> 25:02.067
Ugh. There's
so much to decide--

25:02.101 --> 25:05.872
ceremony, guests, reception.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.406
SPIKE:
Well, first thing, I'd say we're
not having a church wedding.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.178
How 'bout a daytime ceremony
in the park?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.680
(chuckles)
Fabulous.

25:13.712 --> 25:16.848
Enjoy your honeymoon
with the big pile of dust.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.250
BUFFY:
Under the trees.
Indirect sunlight only.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.519
SPIKE:
A warm spring breeze
tosses the leaves aside

25:21.554 --> 25:23.355
and, again, you're registering

25:23.388 --> 25:26.858
as Mr. and Mrs.
Big Pile of Dust.
Stop it!

25:26.893 --> 25:30.261
This is our wedding, and you're
treating it like a big joke.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.263
Oh. Pouty.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.701
Look at that lip.
Gonna get it.

25:34.733 --> 25:37.435
Gonna get it.
Mm. Mm-hmm.

25:37.469 --> 25:40.439
Oh. Stop.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

25:40.471 --> 25:42.942
Yes. Please stop.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.277
(chuckles)

25:45.310 --> 25:47.445
Giles, did you see my ring?

25:47.479 --> 25:50.249
Thankfully, not very well.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.089
I'm not crazy.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.792
And I know
that you probably don't approve.

26:00.826 --> 26:04.596
And my father's not that far
away. I mean, he could...

26:04.631 --> 26:08.233
But this day's about family.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.500
My real family.

26:13.605 --> 26:17.143
And I would like you
to be the one to give me away.

26:17.175 --> 26:18.944
Oh, Buffy...

26:18.978 --> 26:20.946
That's-that's
so...

26:20.980 --> 26:24.282
(groans)
Oh, for God's sake!

26:24.316 --> 26:25.550
This is nonsense.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.721
Something is making...
you act this way.

26:28.755 --> 26:32.057
Don't you realize
what you're doing?

26:32.090 --> 26:34.125
Living the dream.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.596
He's gonna have to take a bit
of time to get used to it, pet.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.499
They all will. But you guys
weren't crazy about Angel

26:40.531 --> 26:42.601
at first either.
You weren't gonna say that name.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.603
Sorry.

26:44.636 --> 26:47.573
Uh, why don't we talk about
where we're gonna register?

26:47.605 --> 26:49.642
Well, where would
Angel like to register?

26:49.675 --> 26:51.644
And, uh, can we
have the photographer
Angel would've wanted

26:51.677 --> 26:53.645
and the flowers
Angel would've liked?

26:53.680 --> 26:56.648
Hey! You think I don't live
with the shadow of Drusilla

26:56.682 --> 26:58.349
over my head?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.118
That I'm not wondering
if you're gonna be thinking

27:00.152 --> 27:02.654
of her
on our honeymoon when

27:02.689 --> 27:04.824
you're making sweet love to me?

27:06.893 --> 27:09.194
(Buffy moaning)

27:09.228 --> 27:12.530
Mmm. Giles, are you okay?

27:13.565 --> 27:16.167
I rather think not.

27:16.201 --> 27:18.805
I-I seem
to be rather, um...

27:18.837 --> 27:22.641
rather... blind.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.643
Completely,
in fact.

27:24.676 --> 27:28.681
What? H-How could this happen?

27:29.682 --> 27:31.784
A spell, I believe.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.786
BUFFY:
Well, we'll fix it.
Don't worry.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.689
What you want is
a general reversal spell.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.624
Gonna need supplies.

27:38.656 --> 27:40.727
Are you... helping me?

27:40.759 --> 27:42.729
Well, it's almost like you're
my father-in-law, isn't it?

27:42.761 --> 27:44.496
BUFFY:
See?

27:44.529 --> 27:46.397
This is how
it's gonna be.

27:46.432 --> 27:49.401
Spike'll even take care of you
while I'm at the magic shop.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.470
(exhales)

27:51.502 --> 27:54.941
From now on, we're a family.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.243
It's all right.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.946
I-I have more scotch.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.089
(sighs)

28:23.434 --> 28:24.435
Hey, Buffy.

28:25.771 --> 28:28.707
What's up?
Riley, look.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.242
Aren't they beautiful?
Uh,

28:31.277 --> 28:33.913
yeah. They're nice.

28:33.945 --> 28:37.682
A little dressy, maybe,
for school, but...

28:37.715 --> 28:40.451
Riley.

28:40.486 --> 28:41.887
Buffy.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.890
I really like you.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.291
I hope you know
that you mean a lot to me.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.593
And if things were different...

28:47.625 --> 28:49.728
Different than what?

28:51.329 --> 28:54.299
I want you to promise me
that we can always be friends.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.603
And I'd really like you
to be there on the day.

28:57.635 --> 28:59.270
The day when...

28:59.305 --> 29:00.239
The wedding.

29:00.271 --> 29:02.273
The wedding. What wedding?

29:02.307 --> 29:05.944
My wedding. I'm getting
married. Can you believe it?

29:05.978 --> 29:10.082
I don't think "no"
is a strong enough word.
I know! It's crazy.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.617
I mean, we fought
for all these years, and then...

29:12.651 --> 29:15.788
Sometimes
you just...

29:15.821 --> 29:19.090
look at someone
and... you know, you know?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.326
No.
I think

29:20.358 --> 29:22.127
maybe we fought because we...

29:22.161 --> 29:24.630
couldn't admit how we
really felt about each other.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.298
Can we start again?

29:26.332 --> 29:28.934
You'll really like him.
Well... nobody really likes him.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.269
I just... I just need to clear
a few things up.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.270
I don't even really like him.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.338
Buffy...

29:33.372 --> 29:35.773
But... I love him.

29:35.807 --> 29:38.277
I do.
Who?

29:38.309 --> 29:39.444
What?

29:39.478 --> 29:41.279
What's his name?
Who?

29:41.313 --> 29:43.281
The groom.
Spike.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.017
That's a name?
Don't be mad.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.451
I'm not mad.
No, you are mad.

29:46.484 --> 29:49.121
No, I am! I... I really...

29:49.154 --> 29:51.022
Wow.
(sighs)

29:51.057 --> 29:53.459
Who is this guy?
Does he go here?

29:53.491 --> 29:56.162
Spike? Oh, no. He's totally old.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.998
Old.
Well, not as old
as my last boyfriend was.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.000
Okay.

30:01.032 --> 30:04.002
It's late, and I'm...

30:04.036 --> 30:05.770
I'm very tired now.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.773
So... I'm just gonna go far away

30:08.807 --> 30:12.144
and be... away.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.211
But...

30:13.244 --> 30:14.546
No.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.815
Stay.

30:21.819 --> 30:25.356
You're ruining my happy day.

30:25.391 --> 30:28.527
That's okay, Mom!
We don't need any more snacks!

30:28.559 --> 30:30.561
I liked those Fruit Roll-Ups.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.898
Shush. I thought
she'd never clear out.

30:32.932 --> 30:36.535
Besides, just think of my lips
as the Fruit Roll-Ups of love.

30:38.569 --> 30:40.306
Okay, that was gross.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.374
I'm a little distracted.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.576
Willow was
really upset.

30:44.609 --> 30:47.012
I shouldn't have let her
go away mad.

30:55.086 --> 30:58.023
Regaining focus.
(chuckles)

30:58.057 --> 30:59.525
We just got rid of your mom.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.727
Let's not bring Willow
into this.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.195
It's time
for just the two of us.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.497
(chuckles)

31:05.530 --> 31:07.532
(snarling)

31:19.545 --> 31:22.381
No, no. Serparvo demon!

31:22.413 --> 31:23.882
Drowning is the only way
to kill it.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.217
(grunts)

31:28.086 --> 31:29.989
(grunting)

31:32.258 --> 31:34.726
(snarling)

31:34.759 --> 31:36.295
What the hell is going on?!

31:39.265 --> 31:41.666
(humming "Bridal Chorus")

31:47.439 --> 31:49.107
GILES:
So the plan is

31:49.141 --> 31:53.412
to cure my total incapacitating
blindness tomorrow, is it?

31:53.444 --> 31:55.413
They were out of taggis root
at the magic shop.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.781
They'll have more tomorrow.

31:56.815 --> 31:59.151
I'm completely
on top of it.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.987
Aren't they
a perfect little us?

32:01.019 --> 32:03.321
I don't like him.
He's insipid.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.991
Clearly human.
Ooh. Red paint.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.993
We could smear
a little on the mouth.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.760
The blood of the innocent.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.762
That's my girl.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.432
Mmm.

32:14.465 --> 32:15.834
Stop that right now!

32:15.866 --> 32:18.136
I can hear the smacking.
Mmm.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.807
Honey, we need
to talk about the invitations.

32:21.839 --> 32:24.742
Now, do you want to be
William the Bloody

32:24.776 --> 32:26.112
or just Spike?

32:26.144 --> 32:27.613
'Cause
either way,

32:27.645 --> 32:29.515
it's gonna look
majorly weird.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.518
Whereas the name Buffy gives it
that touch of classic elegance.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.286
What's wrong with "Buffy"?

32:34.319 --> 32:36.454
Oh, such a good question.
Well,

32:36.488 --> 32:37.689
it's a terrible name.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.191
My mother gave me
that name.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.027
Your mother.
Yeah, she's a genius.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.528
Don't you start in
on my mother.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.133
Board up the windows!
Barricade the doors!

32:47.165 --> 32:48.834
What's going on?

32:48.866 --> 32:51.636
Demons. They keep coming
and coming.
I think we lost 'em,

32:51.670 --> 32:52.938
but I couldn't see.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.839
Spike! He's all untied!

32:54.873 --> 32:56.375
Which
you...

32:56.407 --> 32:58.376
probably noticed.
Xander,

32:58.410 --> 33:00.011
calm down, okay?
If you lost 'em,

33:00.046 --> 33:01.547
that'll give us some time
to figure this out.

33:01.579 --> 33:02.881
Maybe the demons
have something to do

33:02.913 --> 33:03.882
with Giles being blind.

33:03.914 --> 33:05.916
Giles is blind?

33:07.185 --> 33:08.987
Stop... whatever you're doing.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.557
You-you smell
like Fruit Roll-Ups.
This is

33:11.589 --> 33:13.825
the crack team that
foils my every plan?

33:13.858 --> 33:15.693
I am deeply shamed.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.961
BUFFY:
Spike's right.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.696
We really should
get organized.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.932
Why are you holding hands?

33:22.101 --> 33:25.037
They have to hear it
sooner or later.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.239
Spike and I
are getting married.

33:27.272 --> 33:31.210
How? What? How?

33:31.242 --> 33:32.810
Three excellent
questions.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.546
What are you lookin' at?

33:34.579 --> 33:37.148
The man I love.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.851
XANDER:
Uh,

33:39.884 --> 33:43.189
can I be blind, too?

33:43.221 --> 33:46.192
Wait.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.558
Married.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.895
I know somethin'.
What is it?

33:50.929 --> 33:53.199
Everything's
so familiar.

33:53.231 --> 33:55.433
Work, brain, work.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.903
Oh! Oh, oh! Willow!

33:59.137 --> 34:00.771
Mmm. What about--
mmm-- Willow?

34:00.806 --> 34:02.407
Honey, get off.
Something about

34:02.441 --> 34:04.742
Willow and her griefy,
"poor me" mood swings.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.011
So, so tired of it.
You mean I don't have

34:07.045 --> 34:09.181
to be nice
about her anymore?
BUFFY: Well, we're all tired

34:09.215 --> 34:11.449
of it, but what does that have
to do with what's going on?

34:11.483 --> 34:13.385
She told me I-I
was a demon magnet

34:13.418 --> 34:14.952
and-and you two
should get married.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.789
And that I didn't
see anything.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.391
She did a spell.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.960
Yes. To have her will done.

34:21.992 --> 34:24.896
Whatever she says
is coming true.
And you both

34:24.929 --> 34:28.134
were affected! I probably only
escaped because I'm the slayer.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.568
Some kind of natural immunity.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.204
Yeah, right.
You're marrying Spike

34:32.237 --> 34:33.871
because you're so
right for each other.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.275
Xander.
That's it.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.309
You're off the usher list.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.911
People, Willow
is out there,

34:39.945 --> 34:41.079
and she probably
doesn't know what she's doing.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.780
We got to find her.

34:42.813 --> 34:43.949
Before somebody
gets really hurt.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.617
(grunts)
(crash)

34:52.257 --> 34:55.626
(zapping)

34:59.965 --> 35:02.268
Why does he have to come?

35:02.300 --> 35:05.271
Xander, Spike is gonna be
my husband. I want him included.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.273
(scoffs)
I agree with Xander here.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.106
Seems like a lot of work
for people who aren't us.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.510
Spike, these are my friends.
Besides, it's kind of my job.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.179
For now.
What, you want me
to stop working?

35:14.213 --> 35:17.182
Uh, let's see. Do I want you
to give up killing my friends?

35:17.215 --> 35:18.849
Yeah,
I've given it some thought.

35:21.018 --> 35:22.820
This was burned.

35:22.853 --> 35:25.657
D'Hoffryn. Bastard.
He's opened a portal here.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.827
Who?
SPIKE:
Ooh. Fluffy.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.661
Wear this
to the rehearsal dinner,

35:30.695 --> 35:32.998
and the whole thing's off.
Shut up, honey.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.666
ANYA:
D'Hoffryn.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.501
He made me a demon
1,120 years ago.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.135
Why would he
attack Willow?

35:38.170 --> 35:40.672
ANYA: I don't
believe he did.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.342
You have much anger and pain.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.811
Your magic is strong
but your pain--

35:46.844 --> 35:50.715
it's like a scream that
pierces dimensional walls.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.550
We heard your call.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.552
I'm sorry.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.322
I-I'll try for a... quiet rage.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.324
Bye.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.360
Our intention
is not to quash

36:01.393 --> 36:02.793
your potential.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.862
Quite the contrary.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.202
ANYA:
 I'd been dumped.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.471
I was miserable.
Doing a few vengeance spells.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.340
Boils on the penis.
Nothing fancy.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.708
Please skip ahead.
Well, D'Hoffryn got wind of me.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.978
He offered to elevate me.
Meaning?

36:20.010 --> 36:23.047
They made me a demon.
Oh, God. Willow.

36:23.081 --> 36:24.882
But-but you can summon this guy
from this crypt, right?

36:24.916 --> 36:26.485
You can make him stop...
Oh, my God!

36:26.518 --> 36:28.052
Wouldn't this be
a perfect place for pictures?

36:28.085 --> 36:29.920
I'm not posing
for chuff-all.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.021
(snarling)
Hey. Demon.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.096
Okay, listen,

36:38.128 --> 36:41.099
now, we're gonna do this
without destroying the foliage.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.001
(snarling)

36:43.034 --> 36:45.637
(grunting)

36:56.882 --> 36:58.317
(growling)
Let's go!

37:07.726 --> 37:10.128
Spike!

37:10.161 --> 37:12.163
(grunting)

37:16.467 --> 37:20.070
Blessed be in the name
of D'Hoffryn. Let this space

37:20.105 --> 37:22.574
be now a gateway
to the world of Arashmaharr,

37:22.608 --> 37:24.742
where demons are spawned.

37:24.775 --> 37:27.144
The pain and suffering
you brought upon those you love

37:27.177 --> 37:28.914
has been inspired.

37:28.947 --> 37:32.217
You are ready
to join us here in Arashmaharr.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.119
Pain? What pain?

37:35.152 --> 37:36.788
(growling)
(grunting)

37:36.822 --> 37:39.324
Buffy!
We're not doin' well here!

37:39.358 --> 37:40.826
We come in supplication.

37:40.858 --> 37:44.161
We bend as the reed
in the flow of a...

37:44.195 --> 37:46.998
No, wait. We, uh... we-we come
in the flow of a...

37:47.032 --> 37:49.335
(groans, exhales)

37:49.367 --> 37:51.336
Blessed be the name
of D'Hoffryn.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.572
(grunting)

37:53.605 --> 37:57.007
They're strong, and I
can't fight. If they get in,

37:57.041 --> 37:59.311
I don't know
if I can protect you.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.646
You think
you have to protect me?

38:00.679 --> 38:02.914
Oh, not with the girl-power bit.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.483
(growling)

38:04.516 --> 38:07.184
(grunting)

38:35.713 --> 38:39.083
(grunting)

38:40.719 --> 38:42.621
(growling)

38:42.653 --> 38:44.222
(indistinct voices)

38:44.255 --> 38:45.657
Oh, God!

38:45.690 --> 38:48.193
But I didn't mean to!

38:48.226 --> 38:52.297
But you did. This is the result
of your power.

38:52.329 --> 38:53.965
You will make a fine
vengeance demon.

38:53.998 --> 38:57.168
No, please!
You have to help them!

38:57.202 --> 38:59.971
It is not my concern.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.240
You are my interest
in this matter.

39:03.273 --> 39:04.876
Really,

39:04.909 --> 39:06.878
no o-offense intended.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.715
I mean, you've been super nice
and everything,

39:09.748 --> 39:11.483
but I don't want to be a demon.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.552
I-I just want
to go back

39:13.585 --> 39:14.920
and help my friends.

39:14.952 --> 39:16.253
That is your answer?

39:16.286 --> 39:17.556
It-it is.

39:17.588 --> 39:20.826
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.827
Oh, well.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.262
Here is my talisman.

39:25.295 --> 39:26.831
You change
your mind,

39:26.864 --> 39:27.932
give us a chant.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.971
(growling)

39:33.938 --> 39:37.307
(grunting)

39:40.045 --> 39:41.746
Honey!

39:41.780 --> 39:44.081
Oh, Spike,

39:44.114 --> 39:45.516
you okay?

39:45.550 --> 39:48.353
Slayer.

39:48.385 --> 39:51.623
(panting)

39:51.657 --> 39:54.992
A little help here!

39:57.628 --> 39:59.831
(lightning crashing)

40:01.800 --> 40:04.536
Let the healing power begin!

40:04.570 --> 40:07.137
Let my will be safe again.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.807
As these words of peace
are spoken,

40:09.840 --> 40:12.577
let this harmful spell
be broken.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.679
(lightning crashing)

40:21.418 --> 40:22.387
(groans)

40:22.420 --> 40:24.590
Oh! Bloody hell!

40:24.623 --> 40:27.992
(Buffy and Spike groaning)

40:28.025 --> 40:30.327
Spike lips! Lips of Spike!

40:30.360 --> 40:33.097
(groaning)

40:37.302 --> 40:40.539
Hi, guys.

40:42.039 --> 40:45.777
How long are you going
to keep making these?

40:45.811 --> 40:49.447
Oh, until I don't feel
so horribly guilty.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.849
I figure about
a million chips from now.

40:51.882 --> 40:55.721
Also, I have
to detail Giles' car.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.525
Time.
GILES:
Uh-huh.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.960
Five past 2:00.
Clear as day.

41:01.992 --> 41:03.460
Look. Cookies.

41:03.494 --> 41:06.297
A very not evil thing I did.
Oatmeal?

41:06.331 --> 41:08.432
Yes. Very funny.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.268
They're chocolate chip.
I can see them.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.271
I still need my glasses.
You could be more specific

41:13.304 --> 41:15.507
and give me
twenty-twenty.

41:15.541 --> 41:18.043
Eat a cookie,
ease my pain?

41:19.043 --> 41:22.213
Mmm. Better?

41:22.246 --> 41:25.382
Well, baking lifts about 30%
of my guilt

41:25.416 --> 41:28.485
but only seven percent
of my inner turmoil.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.556
Guess that'll
just take a while.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.123
It'll happen.

41:32.157 --> 41:35.126
Don't I get a cookie?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.193
No.

41:36.226 --> 41:38.362
Well, I got to have something.

41:38.396 --> 41:40.798
I still have Buffy taste
in my mouth.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.467
You're a pig, Spike.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.469
Yeah.

41:44.501 --> 41:47.304
Well, I'm not the one who wanted
"Wind Beneath My Wings"

41:47.338 --> 41:48.940
or the
first dance.

41:52.443 --> 41:55.045
That was the spell.

42:02.452 --> 42:05.856
Did I mention
about the sorry part?

42:05.891 --> 42:09.193
We may be
into a forgetting spell later.

42:09.226 --> 42:12.998
I loved him. We were betrothed.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.266
Well, a-at least
you were getting along.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.704
But we weren't.
I mean, it wasn't even nice.

42:18.737 --> 42:22.340
And the bad boy thing? Over it.
Okay? I totally get it.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.577
I'd be really happy
to be in a nice relationship

42:25.610 --> 42:28.012
with a decent, reliable...

42:28.045 --> 42:30.748
Oh, my God.
Riley thinks I'm engaged.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.250
What?
Riley.

42:32.282 --> 42:33.585
He-he saw me.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.452
What the hell
am I gonna say to him?

42:35.485 --> 42:37.789
(chuckles)
You thought I was serious?

42:37.822 --> 42:40.791
Well... no.

42:40.826 --> 42:42.793
Um, you weren't serious?

42:42.827 --> 42:46.463
Oh, God, please. I'm
marrying a guy named Spike?

42:46.496 --> 42:49.768
Maybe. We haven't known
each other that long.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.036
(chuckles)
No. It's just...

42:52.070 --> 42:54.039
I saw that fear in your eyes

42:54.072 --> 42:55.873
when you caught me looking
at wedding dresses,

42:55.907 --> 42:58.777
and I had to give you
a hard time.

42:58.809 --> 43:00.612
I did not have fear in my eyes.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.880
Yes, you did.
You were looking at me

43:02.914 --> 43:05.182
like I was a cartoon ball
and chain.

43:06.818 --> 43:10.621
So you decided to tell me
you're getting married.

43:10.655 --> 43:12.289
Uh-huh.

43:12.322 --> 43:14.659
So... you're insane.

43:14.693 --> 43:15.960
Uh-huh.

43:16.994 --> 43:18.797
But you're still single.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.498
Yes.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.268
Okay then.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.603
Just another little piece
of the Buffy puzzle.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.476
You really have a lot
to learn about women, Riley.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.217
You're gonna teach me.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.231
Grr. Argh.
