Previously on the Secret Life
Of the Amercian Teenager

00:02.662 --> 00:03.594
Will you marry me?

00:03.629 --> 00:06.207
All we said is that you can be friends,
we didn't say you can date him.

00:06.242 --> 00:08.551
I was just trying to help Grace out,
because I like her.

00:08.586 --> 00:10.966
Did??

00:11.001 --> 00:13.100
He's cheating on her,
he's lefting for someone.

00:13.135 --> 00:14.127
??

00:14.162 --> 00:14.933
 I Love you.

00:14.968 --> 00:17.587
Please??

00:17.588 --> 00:19.219
Did u??

00:19.254 --> 00:20.162
-No.
-No.

00:20.197 --> 00:21.543
I've been tied of being 
shamed of being myself.

00:21.544 --> 00:23.112
I've been shamed of being 
myself my whole life.

00:23.112 --> 00:24.190
so, would you shut up?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.918
I've heard this rumor
that I got a girl pregnent.

00:25.953 --> 00:27.918
Is there any truth in that one?

00:27.953 --> 00:30.424
I love you,Amy,
no matter what happends.

01:40.159 --> 01:43.925
Oh, I didn't see you.
You startled me.

01:44.991 --> 01:46.509
Why didn't you say something?

01:47.292 --> 01:50.167
Why are you sitting all alone
here in the dark?

01:52.625 --> 01:54.474
Amy?

01:55.792 --> 01:57.826
I'm having a baby.

01:57.858 --> 02:02.425
What? I'm sorry,
I just woke up. What?

02:03.426 --> 02:05.392
I'm having a baby.

02:05.964 --> 02:08.025
What?

02:08.058 --> 02:11.792
I'm having a baby.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.359
What do you mean,
you're having a baby?

02:15.392 --> 02:19.459
Is this... is this some kind
of school assignment?

02:19.492 --> 02:20.792
No.

02:22.692 --> 02:25.958
I'm... pregnant?

02:26.958 --> 02:29.359
Amy, you can't be pregnant.

02:29.688 --> 02:30.800
That's impossible.

02:30.835 --> 02:33.759
Yeah... that's what
I thought.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.826
But I am. Doctor told me.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.425
What doctor?

02:38.459 --> 02:39.445
Dr. Hightower.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.239
Dr. Hightower told you
you're having a baby?

02:42.274 --> 02:43.241
Yeah.

02:43.526 --> 02:46.991
When? When did she
tell you that?

02:47.025 --> 02:48.101
Um, I don't know.

02:48.136 --> 02:51.692
Maybe, like, six weeks ago
or something.

02:51.847 --> 02:53.767
You went to see her
six weeks ago,

02:53.802 --> 02:55.938
and she told you
you're having a baby?

02:57.734 --> 02:58.997
I-I don't understand.

02:59.032 --> 03:00.730
Did you go
and see her on your own?

03:01.103 --> 03:03.304
Because you thought
you were...

03:07.614 --> 03:10.292
Y-You can't be pregnant.

03:11.738 --> 03:13.695
How could this
possibly have happened?

03:13.730 --> 03:17.062
I didn't mean for it to happen.
It just kinda happened.

03:17.682 --> 03:20.126
Is this something you and your sister
have come up with?

03:20.397 --> 03:22.876
Is this some kind
of conspiracy

03:22.911 --> 03:25.483
to get my mind
off of your father?

03:25.852 --> 03:27.812
You want me to think
you're pregnant so

03:27.847 --> 03:30.898
whatever's really happening
isn't so bad. Is that it?

03:31.192 --> 03:33.843
Mom, I'm really pregnant.

03:34.450 --> 03:36.064
No, seriously.

03:36.743 --> 03:38.891
Amy, tell me the truth.

03:38.925 --> 03:40.610
OK, look at me
and tell me the truth.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.173
I am telling you the truth.

03:44.459 --> 03:48.025
You can't be having a baby
at 15 years old.

03:50.192 --> 03:51.514
What's going on?

03:52.130 --> 03:53.432
Ashley?

03:53.808 --> 03:55.151
Ashley!

03:57.407 --> 03:59.321
Did you know anything
about this?

03:59.592 --> 04:02.776
Uh... I'm not sure.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.242
Yes, she knows.

04:04.277 --> 04:07.741
-She knows?
-She just kind of found out.

04:08.559 --> 04:11.520
Mom, I didn't mean for it
to happen. I really didn't.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.116
You didn't mean
for what to happen?

04:13.220 --> 04:15.178
You didn't mean to have sex?

04:15.295 --> 04:17.000
You didn't mean
to get pregnant?

04:19.123 --> 04:21.920
You know, it could've been
an alien abduction.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.992
I hear there's a lot of that
happening.

04:26.459 --> 04:28.350
I think I want an abortion.

04:29.905 --> 04:31.356
OK, you can run now. Go.

04:31.356 --> 04:32.404
I didn't do anything.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.143
Just go to your room, Ashley!

04:34.653 --> 04:37.240
All right. She's the one
that's having a baby.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.940
An abortion?

04:41.337 --> 04:43.078
I don't wanna have a baby.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.589
Uh... I don't know, Amy.

04:47.589 --> 04:49.781
I just... I don't know.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.212
L-Let's just
think about this, OK?

04:53.465 --> 04:55.629
Let's think about
all of the options.

04:56.068 --> 04:59.571
Mom, if you don't let me get
an abortion, I wanna leave.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.443
Go somewhere.

05:02.499 --> 05:05.330
Aren't there, like, homes
for teenage mothers?

05:06.218 --> 05:07.513
Find me a home.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.426
But, honey,
this is your home.

05:10.817 --> 05:14.408
I can't stay here
and have a baby.

<font color="#ffff00">S01E06</font>

06:02.340 --> 06:03.760
She's not gonna be in today

06:03.760 --> 06:07.467
and, um, probably not
for the rest of this week.

06:07.831 --> 06:09.792
We have to go to Chicago.

06:10.826 --> 06:12.551
Someone died.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.138
Yeah, it was a family member.
What difference does it make?

06:17.870 --> 06:21.509
Anyway, I'm sure she can catch up with her
assignments when we get back.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.292
Thank you.

06:23.361 --> 06:24.360
 Bye.

06:26.863 --> 06:29.682
I'm gonna call my ob/gyn
as soon as the office opens.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.970
Why can't I go to
Dr. Hightower?

06:32.030 --> 06:34.038
Amy, she's a pediatrician,

06:34.589 --> 06:37.563
and I'm really not happy
she didn't call me about this.

06:37.838 --> 06:40.787
And because her partner
is your father's ex-wife's husband,

06:40.787 --> 06:42.802
so that means he probably knows,

06:43.251 --> 06:44.834
and if he knows, then she knows,

06:44.834 --> 06:47.324
and I'm really not happy
that they knew before I did.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.369
Wait. Mom, 

06:48.370 --> 06:50.660
you don't think
he'd tell Grace about this, do you?

06:51.165 --> 06:53.318
Yeah, Amy, probably.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.529
I left word for your dad
at his office.

06:58.530 --> 06:59.425
Why?

06:59.954 --> 07:02.785
I don't know who he's with,
so I didn't wanna call his cell.

07:02.785 --> 07:05.897
No, no, no. I meant...
do you have to tell him?

07:05.897 --> 07:09.543
I don't want to, but I think we should
before someone else does.Don't you?

07:09.543 --> 07:10.830
Do we have to?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.195
Yes.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.152
Well, what if I just don't
have the baby?

07:18.362 --> 07:19.763
Not have the baby?

07:23.104 --> 07:27.522
 Amy, you can
think about... that.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.256
That's totally your choice, but...

07:31.193 --> 07:33.087
I don't think I can tell you
to do that,

07:33.087 --> 07:35.463
and it's not a religious thing
with me at all.

07:36.034 --> 07:38.733
It's just how I feel about...

07:39.868 --> 07:42.888
...I don't know, life.

07:44.939 --> 07:46.227
Have you told Ben?

07:48.215 --> 07:52.121
Oh, Amy... what happened
to having a plan?

07:52.121 --> 07:54.130
You're supposed to have
a plan for sex.

07:54.737 --> 07:56.085
You're supposed to have a plan

07:56.086 --> 07:57.573
that says you'll wait
until you're older

07:57.573 --> 07:58.855
so you can get an education

07:58.856 --> 08:01.431
and have a career before you
settle down and start a family.

08:01.571 --> 08:03.646
I never thought about it.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.982
I didn't know any guy
would ever wanna do it with me.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.984
Maybe we can
think about adoption.

08:09.635 --> 08:11.831
Or you can go away
until the baby comes.

08:12.190 --> 08:13.662
What if you go to my mom's?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.159
Do you wanna go to Mimsy's?

08:15.159 --> 08:17.723
No, I don't want Mimsy
to know about this.

08:17.723 --> 08:19.187
-Amy...
-What?

08:19.432 --> 08:21.562
You didn't tell Mimsy Dad left.

08:21.562 --> 08:22.867
She doesn't need to know
about that.

08:22.867 --> 08:25.030
She doesn't need to know
about this.

08:29.013 --> 08:30.923
Can I just ask you something?

08:32.772 --> 08:33.900
What?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.711
If I did end up
having the baby,

08:37.014 --> 08:38.496
do you think
I could get married?

08:38.498 --> 08:39.440
Married?

08:39.440 --> 08:41.650
Yeah. Ben said
he would marry me.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.278
Is that how this happened?

08:43.471 --> 08:46.095
Ben said he would marry you
if you got pregnant?

08:46.647 --> 08:48.252
So am I going to school,
or what?

08:48.252 --> 08:50.507
No, not today. 

08:50.774 --> 08:52.530
You should've
told me about this.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.281
That's my punishment
for not telling you,

08:54.628 --> 08:56.243
not going to school? Fine.

08:56.243 --> 08:57.659
If you knew your sister
was in trouble,

08:57.660 --> 08:58.916
you should've told me.

08:58.916 --> 08:59.739
Yeah. 

08:59.740 --> 09:02.915
I guess I also should've told you
your marriage was in trouble.

09:08.857 --> 09:10.389
Ashley, wait.

09:11.522 --> 09:14.553
 Look, I know you blame me
for your dad leaving,

09:14.553 --> 09:16.077
but maybe
it's not my fault.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.977
Or maybe it is.

09:19.821 --> 09:21.951
I'm gonna sit on the steps
and wait for him.

09:21.951 --> 09:23.647
Your dad hasn't
called me back yet.

09:23.648 --> 09:24.622
He will.

09:25.046 --> 09:27.977
Just please wait inside.
Please.

09:27.977 --> 09:29.172
Can't, Mom. 

09:30.289 --> 09:31.531
I don't wanna be inside.

09:31.531 --> 09:33.754
I hate this house.
I hate everything about it.

09:34.669 --> 09:36.129
Including me?

09:38.281 --> 09:43.820
Mom, just please, please do not
send Amy off to Mimsy's.

09:44.135 --> 09:46.035
It's bad enough Dad left.
If she leaves,

09:46.035 --> 09:48.785
there's no one here for me,
no one I like, anyway.

09:48.785 --> 09:50.296
Oh, thanks.

09:51.141 --> 09:53.927
 You know, your sister's the one
that wants to go away.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.250
-Where else am I gonna send her?
- Nowhere.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.221
Just don't let her go, Mom, please.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.710
Ashley, I don't know if Amy
can stay here and be pregnant

10:05.710 --> 10:07.870
and have a baby.

10:07.870 --> 10:11.020
I don't know how she can handle
everyone else knowing.

10:11.020 --> 10:14.285
But they do know.
The whole world knows.

10:42.592 --> 10:44.198
-Hello?
-Hi, Ames.

10:44.826 --> 10:45.647
Hi, Dad.

10:45.647 --> 10:47.694
Your mom called me, about you.

10:48.146 --> 10:50.029
What's going on? She said
you're sick or something?

10:50.029 --> 10:52.309
Uh, not exactly.

10:52.309 --> 10:54.581
Uh-oh. Woman problems?

10:54.581 --> 10:57.515
Huh... sort of.

10:59.831 --> 11:03.834
So... you don't need
to come home or anything.

11:03.834 --> 11:04.649
I'll be OK.

11:04.649 --> 11:06.769
Yeah? You sure?

11:06.769 --> 11:09.040
Yeah, positive.
So how are you?

11:09.040 --> 11:13.299
Me? Oh, I'm all right.
Miss my girls.

11:15.359 --> 11:16.326
Amy?

11:16.914 --> 11:18.255
Dad.

11:19.544 --> 11:22.971
Aw, Ames. Aw, baby, don't cry,
sweetheart.

11:22.971 --> 11:24.314
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make you cry.

11:24.314 --> 11:25.754
I'll get home as soon as I can,

11:26.170 --> 11:27.498
as soon as your mom lets me.

11:27.692 --> 11:29.545
Dad, I think
I need to tell you something

11:29.546 --> 11:32.079
and please don't be mad at me.

11:32.544 --> 11:34.456
How could I ever be mad at you?

11:34.675 --> 11:35.722
Wait a minute. 

11:35.861 --> 11:38.584
Did you break up with the Sausage King's kid?
Is that what this is about?

11:38.584 --> 11:39.539
No.

11:40.148 --> 11:41.660
So that's
still going good, huh?

11:42.204 --> 11:43.895
Yeah, I guess.

11:44.146 --> 11:45.707
So what's the matter
with my girl?

11:46.742 --> 11:48.818
She's pregnant, George.

11:49.326 --> 11:51.325
Amy's pregnant.

12:00.592 --> 12:03.395
I don't think you should make
any more phone calls right now.

12:04.178 --> 12:05.993
You just need time to think.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.362
Just... gimme a little time.

12:09.657 --> 12:11.908
I'll give it back to you
eventually.

12:31.464 --> 12:33.643
-Call her.
-I texted her.

12:33.871 --> 12:34.813
And?

12:35.273 --> 12:36.310
Nothing.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.286
I have a bad feeling
about this.

12:39.532 --> 12:43.753
Me too. Maybe we could
go over there during lunch.

12:44.675 --> 12:46.459
Just show up at her house?

12:46.459 --> 12:49.874
We could tell her mom we were 
bringing her her assignments.

12:49.874 --> 12:51.145
I can't.

12:51.390 --> 12:54.663
We could make it legit, actually
take her her assiments.

12:54.663 --> 12:56.550
I know her class schedule.

12:56.551 --> 12:59.084
I-I really can't.

12:59.084 --> 13:00.403
My parents won't let me.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.385
Since when?

13:01.422 --> 13:03.047
Since I told them.

13:03.047 --> 13:04.498
I can't believe you told them.

13:04.498 --> 13:06.346
What if she's not even home?
Maybe...

13:06.346 --> 13:10.485
maybe she went to...
you know, take care of things.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.428
Take care of things?

13:12.587 --> 13:15.075
Shut up, Lauren.
She's not going to do that.

13:15.075 --> 13:18.346
Madison, it's her decision,
not yours and not mine.

13:18.346 --> 13:20.792
Amy has a right to decide
what she wants to do.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.810
If she wants to
terminate the pregnancy,

13:23.811 --> 13:25.368
it's none of our business.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.222
We can have an opinion,
but it's her choice.

13:30.007 --> 13:31.447
Hello, ladies.

13:32.322 --> 13:33.949
Is your friend Amy around?

13:36.325 --> 13:39.064
She missed band practice.
Is she sick or somethin'?

13:39.603 --> 13:41.296
Do you speak?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.940
I think
she stayed home today.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.163
You think or you know?

13:45.163 --> 13:48.483
I think if Amy wanted you
to know where she was, she'd call you.

13:48.483 --> 13:50.098
Maybe I'll ask your brother.
Maybe he would know.

13:50.198 --> 13:51.837
How do you know
I have a brother?

13:51.837 --> 13:54.223
'Cause he's got a big mouth
he should keep shut right now.

13:54.223 --> 13:56.745
We all should keep our mouths
shut now, don't you think?

13:57.120 --> 14:00.020
I tried calling you
last night, all night.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.419
Yeah, I know that.
I had to turn my phone off.

14:02.419 --> 14:04.425
I had to report in to that guy
I was telling you about,

14:04.425 --> 14:06.050
the guy who's like
a parole officer.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.202
He has to make sure
I'm not getting beaten or anything.

14:08.202 --> 14:11.945
After that, I had to meet with him
and my foster parents

14:11.945 --> 14:14.649
so they could confirm
they're not beatin' me.

14:14.650 --> 14:15.479
That was my night.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.882
Yeah, OK, whatever.

14:17.642 --> 14:19.628
Have you heard the rumors
going around school?

14:19.628 --> 14:21.148
I'm not really into gossip.

14:21.348 --> 14:23.634
I did wanna talk to
Amy Juergens about something.

14:23.635 --> 14:24.749
Have you seen her?

14:24.912 --> 14:26.852
Weren't you gonna give her
a ride home yesterday?

14:26.852 --> 14:28.253
I offered her a ride.

14:28.254 --> 14:29.122
Why is that?

14:29.122 --> 14:30.506
I wanted to talk to her.

14:30.507 --> 14:31.531
About?

14:31.817 --> 14:33.986
A couple of things,
including you.

14:34.876 --> 14:38.467
I don't think it would be too smart
if Amy had your baby.Do you?

14:38.467 --> 14:39.794
What baby?

14:39.794 --> 14:41.390
You know what baby.

14:42.102 --> 14:43.194
So did you talk to her?

14:43.194 --> 14:45.390
No, I couldn't find her,
so I'm talkin' to you.

14:45.390 --> 14:49.326
Look, leave her alone and let things take
their natural course, OK?

14:49.326 --> 14:50.156
Meaning?

14:50.156 --> 14:53.186
Meaning Amy Juergens
is not having a baby at 15,

14:53.186 --> 14:54.637
so don't interfere.

14:54.637 --> 14:56.055
It's not like you could.

14:56.055 --> 14:57.950
I'm sure she's already
taken care of it, 

14:57.951 --> 14:59.693
which is probably 
why she's not here.

14:59.693 --> 15:01.901
Why would I wanna interfere
with something like that?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.404
Oh, I don't know

15:03.405 --> 15:05.756
Maybe because you want to convince
the whole world

15:05.756 --> 15:07.115
you're a Christian now.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.746
So let me see,

15:08.747 --> 15:11.699
 you're jealous
of both Amy and Grace?

15:11.699 --> 15:13.946
I'm not jealous of anyone.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.849
We're just friends,
remember?

15:15.849 --> 15:18.317
Yeah, I remember.

15:19.569 --> 15:20.967
Grace heard about Amy.

15:21.359 --> 15:23.727
Does seem to be all over school
this morning.

15:23.727 --> 15:25.862
Please tell me you don't
want her so badly

15:25.862 --> 15:28.773
that you'd pretend to care about 
that baby just to impress her.

15:28.773 --> 15:31.197
You have a very low
 opinion of me.Don't you?

15:31.197 --> 15:32.697
Yeah, I do.

15:36.376 --> 15:39.283
Hi, Ricky. How are you?
Tough day?

15:39.283 --> 15:42.651
Yeah, it is a tough day,
but it's not true, you know,

15:42.651 --> 15:44.442
about Amy Juergens.

15:44.967 --> 15:47.772
I told you what happened before,
but just believe me,

15:47.772 --> 15:49.892
even though
it was her idea,

15:49.892 --> 15:52.349
I'll??

15:52.349 --> 15:54.856
She's not??

15:54.856 --> 15:55.590
Ricky...

15:55.690 --> 15:58.939
She's a sweet girl.
She's just a little mixed up.

15:58.939 --> 16:01.457
I'm sure she's not having
my baby. I'm positive.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.344
I don't know.

16:02.915 --> 16:04.639
Where did you hear that?

16:04.639 --> 16:05.831
Can't say.

16:06.158 --> 16:08.398
-Adrian?
-Can't.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.624
Ricky, did you read that
 bible passage I told you about?

16:11.964 --> 16:13.822
Oh, no,
the bible passage.

16:13.822 --> 16:16.095
We don't have any of those
bible books in the house.

16:16.096 --> 16:17.157
I'll get you one.

16:17.157 --> 16:19.197
No, don't spend your money
on me, babe.

16:19.197 --> 16:21.077
I've got an extra one.
I'll bring it for you.

16:21.077 --> 16:24.525
All right, well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.516
Look, Ricky, I'm trying to be
a friend to you.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.875
You're gonna need a friend,
I think...

16:29.670 --> 16:33.449
because Amy Juergens
really is having a baby.

16:33.449 --> 16:35.895
-I have it on good authority.
-But...

16:36.707 --> 16:39.263
Well, I mean,
maybe she was,

16:39.263 --> 16:42.214
but according to someone else,
she's taken care of it.

16:42.214 --> 16:44.217
What do you mean,
taken care of it?

16:46.368 --> 16:48.532
Wait, you mean
she's having an abortion?

16:48.532 --> 16:50.148
I think
that's a possibility.

16:50.148 --> 16:53.184
Oh, no. Come on.

16:54.916 --> 16:58.119
I will not let anything bad
happen to your baby.

17:08.030 --> 17:09.912
Her phone's not in service.

17:09.912 --> 17:12.983
It was in service an hour ago.
How can it not be in service?

17:12.983 --> 17:14.689
Ashley. Call Ashley.

17:14.689 --> 17:16.130
Yeah, Ashley. I'll call...

17:22.946 --> 17:24.135
What?

17:24.135 --> 17:26.718
Hey, Ashley.
It's me - Madison.

17:26.718 --> 17:29.078
No kidding. That must be why your 
name showed up on my phone.

17:29.078 --> 17:30.723
Yeah, right. Um,

17:30.953 --> 17:33.741
 I was having a little trouble
getting ahold of Amy?

17:33.741 --> 17:34.869
Mom took her cell.

17:35.217 --> 17:37.656
Well, could we maybe
talk to her on your phone?

17:37.888 --> 17:40.468
Best I can do is try
to give her a message.

17:40.799 --> 17:42.559
What's the message?

17:43.884 --> 17:46.898
I know. How about you're both very sorry
you told everyone in the world

17:46.898 --> 17:48.907
that your best friend
Amy's pregnant?

17:52.844 --> 17:54.850
She knows we told people.

17:56.072 --> 17:58.104
Look, I have to go over there.

17:58.104 --> 18:00.073
If you don't wanna go,
it's your own business.

18:00.073 --> 18:01.568
How are you gonna get there?

18:01.568 --> 18:04.970
There's a really big thing
with a lot of wheels called a bus.

18:14.424 --> 18:15.912
Losers called.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.719
Madison and Lauren?

18:22.185 --> 18:23.881
You still have your cell.

18:23.881 --> 18:25.498
Mom didn't take it from you?

18:25.498 --> 18:27.003
Yeah. She's in the show-

18:27.003 --> 18:28.638
-Give it to me.
-OK.

18:32.109 --> 18:34.573
Um, can I have the number
for Adrian Lee?

18:36.369 --> 18:39.162
No, it's either residential
or a cell phone.

18:41.576 --> 18:44.023
Just please give me the number.

18:53.993 --> 18:56.477
Adrian, hey. Wait up.

18:56.884 --> 18:58.455
I need a ride.
Can you gimme a ride?

18:58.456 --> 18:59.300
No.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.691
I'll pay you.

19:00.692 --> 19:02.916
 I need to get
to Amy's house, Amy Juergens.

19:03.032 --> 19:03.912
Pay me?

19:04.284 --> 19:05.855
How's $100?

19:06.999 --> 19:08.175
200?

19:08.175 --> 19:10.942
She wants me to take her
to a clinic. She called me.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.334
Yeah, I know.
She called me, too.

19:12.449 --> 19:13.691
She's gonna need money.

19:13.691 --> 19:15.053
It's a free clinic.

19:15.266 --> 19:17.952
Just the same,
she wants me to be there.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.499
$200.

19:21.499 --> 19:23.385
250, and we'll call it a day.

19:23.676 --> 19:25.157
Come on.

19:28.524 --> 19:29.799
She's a new patient,

19:29.799 --> 19:31.332
but I'm not a new patient.

19:31.332 --> 19:33.271
I've been coming there
for years.

19:34.851 --> 19:35.930
Really? 

19:36.358 --> 19:38.822
I was hoping he could
work her in this afternoon.

19:38.822 --> 19:40.278
It's an emergency.

19:41.233 --> 19:43.656
No, not an emergency-room
emergency. 

19:43.656 --> 19:45.989
An I-need-to-see-
Dr. Ahn emergency.

19:47.088 --> 19:48.192
She's on the phone.

19:48.192 --> 19:50.107
She can't get you in
to see her doctor

19:50.107 --> 19:52.578
or at least it doesn't
sound like it.

19:52.578 --> 19:53.862
Shut the door.

19:55.032 --> 19:56.550
I'm...

19:57.422 --> 20:00.110
I'm not going to her doctor.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.700
Yeah, OK, but where are you going?

20:03.300 --> 20:05.900
I can't tell you because 
then you'd have information

20:05.900 --> 20:08.400
that a lot of others are gonna want, but...

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
let's just say I'm taking control.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.700
I won't tell anyone.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.500
I think you can trust me at this point.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.400
Ashley, I know I can trust you, I know.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.800
It's just... it's better
for you not to know.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.900
What happened to Dad?
Where is he?

20:28.900 --> 20:30.100
What's going on?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.200
We were just looking for Dad.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.200
He's probably at the high school
looking for Ben Boykewich.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.200
Ben?

20:40.200 --> 20:41.800
Yeah, that would be my guess.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.200
OK, you guys, if there's
anything else I don't know,

20:50.200 --> 20:52.200
I think now's the time to tell me.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.400
Married?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.700
- They're in love.
- They're 15.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.800
I fell in love with my
wife when I was 14.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.400
You didn't get married
when you were 14.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.200
I wish we had.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.300
Our parents made us
wait till we were 18.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.300
All those years, wasted.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.800
You actually think they should
get married and have a baby at 15.???

21:12.800 --> 21:15.700
It's a little unconventional,
but, hey, they're good kids.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.100
???If they were good kids,we wouldn't
be sitting here having this conversation.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.400
We're not talking abt them
drinking or doing drugs,

21:21.400 --> 21:24.100
we're talking about two
kids in love, that's all.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.100
That's n???

21:26.100 --> 21:30.700
It's not the ideal situation,
but it could be worse.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.200
She's my baby.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.800
Well, he's my baby.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.000
It's not what either of us
would've planned for our children.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm just saying Ben and I would be very
pleased to share our good fortune with Amy,

21:41.100 --> 21:45.900
if you'd be kind enough to allow her to
make an honest young man outta him.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.600
Ben and me, we're in
that big house all alone.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.700
We'll take very good care
of your Amy. I promise you that.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.500
Suppose this little teage
marriage doesn't work out.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.900
Suppose it does.

21:59.900 --> 22:00.600
You can't be serious.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.500
Two 15-year-olds getting
married and having a baby.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.700
I don't want my daughter married at 15.
Why would you want your son married at 15?

22:08.000 --> 22:08.800
Misses his mother.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.600
You can't give him my daughter.

22:10.700 --> 22:11.900
He loves her.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.600
So do I.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.700
Your wife is calling.
She says it's an emergency.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.700
Emergency!

22:26.500 --> 22:29.300
Yeah, hi. I turned my cell phone off.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.600
I'm here talking to Leo Boykewich.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.200
I think it does concern him.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.300
What are you talking about? Who?

22:38.100 --> 22:42.500
It's not... it's not even
your son's baby.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.000
Could be.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.100
Go. She's talking to Dad.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.800
- I love you, Ashley.
- Just go.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.600
Amy, Leo Boykewich went -

23:02.900 --> 23:04.200
W-Where's Amy?

23:04.200 --> 23:06.500
- She's in the bathroom.
- Oh.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.100
So, who went to see Dad?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.200
Ben's father.

23:13.200 --> 23:16.700
Really? That was nice.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.600
So, are you gonna let them get married?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.800
Ashley, she's 15 years old.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.300
Besides, it's not Ben's responsibility.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.700
Well, would you rather
she marry Ricky? He's 16.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.000
No, I don't want her to marry
either one of them.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.200
I don't want her to get married, period.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.400
I think it's gonna complicate
her life even more.

23:40.700 --> 23:42.900
Are you sure she's in the bathroom?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.600
- She was.
- Amy!

23:45.700 --> 23:47.100
I'm here, Mom.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.700
Hi.
Hurry up.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.200
So are we going or not?

23:59.300 --> 24:01.800
Ben, I really don't think
you should be here.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.900
I thought you told him to come 
with us. That's what he said.

24:04.900 --> 24:07.900
I can't let you do this.
My dad is talking to your dad.

24:07.900 --> 24:10.100
He's trying to talk him into
letting us get married.

24:10.100 --> 24:10.900
Married?

24:10.900 --> 24:13.300
Yes, married.
I love her.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.500
I wanna marry her,
and I also want some privacy.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.900
Ben, I told my mother it's Ricky's baby.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.700
What'd you do that for?

24:20.700 --> 24:24.700
Can you stay out of this, please?
What'd you do that for?

24:25.500 --> 24:26.200
It's the truth.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.000
She said she'd help me
if I told her the truth.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.700
Ben, it's really nice of you
to wanna marry me,

24:31.700 --> 24:34.600
but this is not your problem.
This is my problem.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.000
Yeah, well, now it's also
Ricky's problem.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.100
He's not going to marry you.
You know that, right?

24:40.100 --> 24:42.600
Ricky will never marry you.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
Yes, Adrian, I know that.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.200
But I will. I'll marry you.
I love you.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.300
I don't care about anything else
but you and that baby.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.300
And maybe the cymbals.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.500
I don't want to have a baby, Ben.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.200
Of course you don't.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.600
But you're going to have a baby,
and that's OK with me.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.000
No, I can't. I just, I can't.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.800
Yes, you can.
It's gonna be OK.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.600
You thought the worst part
was telling your parents,

25:07.600 --> 25:11.000
but now that you've told them,
everything gets better from here.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.400
They love you.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.900
Yeah, I guess.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.400
My mom is talking about
sending me off to some home

25:18.400 --> 25:20.900
where there are other girls
in the same situation?

25:21.700 --> 25:23.400
Ben, she's talking about adoption.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.600
Then that settles it.
Don't have the baby.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.700
You don't want some 
weird couple raising a baby

25:28.700 --> 25:31.500
that's gonna track you down
when your life is finally getting better.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.800
Adrian, I'd be more than happy
to double your car fare

25:34.800 --> 25:36.900
if you'll just shut up, OK?

25:37.100 --> 25:40.700
Some things are more important
than money, even to me.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.700
He's not gonna marry you,
either. You know that, right?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.900
Ricky is never going to marry you.

25:45.900 --> 25:49.400
OK, can you guys just 
drive me to the clinic?

25:49.400 --> 25:51.400
You two can argue while you wait for me.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.400
I just feel that if your decision
is not to have the baby,

25:57.400 --> 26:01.400
you really should talk to your parents
or at least to your mother.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.100
This is a big decision
to make all by yourself.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.500
But it is her decision.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.100
She's right. This is up to me.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.100
I've decided. Drive.

26:28.700 --> 26:29.500
No wonder she's in trouble.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.700
You can't keep an eye on
her in the middle of this.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.500
Shut up, George. It's not my fault.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.100
- Sure that is. You're her mother.
- And you're her father.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.900
You're the one who was supposed
to talk to her about sex.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.600
She was never interested
in talking about it.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.500
She was more focused on
her friends and her music.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.300
And having sex.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.500
- It was just one time.
- That's what they all say.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.300
All say? Who says that?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.900
Every girl who's afraid to tell
her parents she's having a baby.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.100
I believe her.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.400
You believed me when I said
I was said it was workin' late.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.400
You're criticizing me
for trusting you? 

26:55.400 --> 26:58.000
No. I'm criticizing you for trusting her.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.400
I think it's ridiculous we're
not out there looking for her.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.900
Where are we gonna look?
I know she'll come home.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.300
What, after she has an abortion?

27:04.300 --> 27:07.100
She wanted to be with Ben.
She's with Ben. 

27:07.100 --> 27:07.800
Good.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.300
I'm not so sure she shouldn't marry Ben.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.600
Don't be ridiculous.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.000
Being ridiculous.
It might make sense.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.000
- Hi, Mr. Juergens.
- Hi, Madison.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.500
Is Amy home? I brought
her things from school.

27:23.500 --> 27:27.100
I brought her notes,
her assignments from class.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.700
You know, notes.
They're really good notes.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.100
OK. I'll give 'em to her.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.800
Could I give 'em to her?
Um, is she home?

27:33.800 --> 27:36.400
Uh, yeah, but she's a little under the weather,

27:36.400 --> 27:40.300
and it's something that might be
contagious, so you shouldn't stick around.

27:40.300 --> 27:43.300
Oh, OK.
Hi, Mrs. Juergens.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.700
- If you could tell her I was trying to call her.
- OK.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.200
But... Bye, Amy!

27:50.200 --> 27:52.000
OK, bye. Bye.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.700
Maybe if you didn't let her
heng out with those two,

27:56.700 --> 27:58.000
none of this would've happened. 

27:58.000 --> 27:59.500
Madison and Lauren?

27:59.500 --> 28:02.500
They're very nice girls,
and so is Amy.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.700
Yeah, just not as nice as we thought.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.500
And who's this Richie
character, anyway?

28:06.500 --> 28:08.500
Ricky. He's in the band.
You've seen him.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.400
He's that drummer
that's always showing off.

28:16.600 --> 28:17.700
Hey...

28:23.600 --> 28:27.100
- Maybe it's time I come home.
- No, I don't think so.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.800
Come on, you need me.
We need each other.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.200
You said it yourself,
you don't do well in a crisis.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.600
Lean on me, all right?

28:33.600 --> 28:35.900
We'll get through this together.
We'll figure it out.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.800
You can't handle something like this.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.400
You can't handle little Amy going through
something like this, not without me.

28:41.700 --> 28:44.900
How's Amy gonna face people?
How are you gonna face people?

28:44.900 --> 28:48.000
I don't know, George.
How do you face people?

29:01.100 --> 29:02.700
I'm not gonna cause you any problems...

29:02.700 --> 29:03.900
No, you're certainly not.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.200
Is there a girl named Amy Juergens here?

29:06.200 --> 29:09.500
Who's here a who's not
ot none of your business.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.000
But if you need help
with family planning,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.300
I'd be happy to set you up
with one of our counselors.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.800
Jesus is my counselor.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.500
What a coincidence.
He's mine, too.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.700
I don't think so.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.100
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

29:21.100 --> 29:22.700
- Where's Amy?
- Amy? Who's Amy?

29:22.700 --> 29:26.400
Ben and I are here to...
get free condoms.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.700
Let's just step outside.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.200
I know she's here.

29:32.300 --> 29:35.500
This isn't a teen center. We're
not gonna have any ruckus here.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.800
You and your friends
need to step outside.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.100
Security.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.400
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.700
I'm not gonna let you
do this, Amy!

29:46.000 --> 29:47.600
- Now all of you.
- Amy!

29:47.600 --> 29:49.600
- Outside, Miss.
- I'm not doing anything.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.900
Just a minute. You two drove her 
here. You're accessories to a crime.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.700
Didn't I tell you
to stay out of this?

29:54.700 --> 29:56.600
Are you that desperate
to sleep with her?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.900
You really think
she'd be any fun at all?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Is that all you ever think about sex?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.800
Tell her the truth,you cower.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.700
You don't care about Amy or that baby.
You don't care if Amy has an abortion.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.900
Yes, he does and so do I.
And so does God.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.600
Oh, honey, they do not take
a vote on these things.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.700
Don't call me honey.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.800
Why not? Honey.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.800
- I'm not with these guys, I swear.
- Yo, Ben.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.300
Someone wants to talk to you.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.500
All right, let's move it
outside. Come on.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.400
Amy, are you OK? Hey.

30:38.100 --> 30:42.200
Ben, I'm so sorry
I yelled at you.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.800
Oh, it's OK. You can yell
at me my whole life.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.900
He took advantage of her just like
he's trying to take advantage of you.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.200
She seduced him.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.800
Oh, come on. Is that
what he told you?

30:59.800 --> 31:02.300
All right, you two.
I'm standing right here.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.200
Forget about me. There's a very
hurt and confused girl in there.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.600
And who hurt and confused her?

31:07.900 --> 31:09.700
Why do you have to blame
everything on Ricky?

31:09.800 --> 31:12.900
Amy is just as responsible
for what happened.
She wanted to have sex.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.900
Oh, and that is so wrong,
isn't it, Grace?

31:15.900 --> 31:17.700
Outside of marriage,
yeah, it is wrong.

31:17.700 --> 31:22.700
It's normal. It's normal
to want to have sex.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.600
It's even normal
to actually do it.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.500
- It's a sin.
- Oh, yeah.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.800
And all us normal teenagers
are going straight to hell.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.300
Is that what you think?

31:33.500 --> 31:37.300
You know what?
Jack really liked it.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.400
You know that?

31:39.800 --> 31:43.700
And he would never be happy
with you after being with me.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.200
I wouldn't wanna be with Jack
after he's been with you.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.500
You want to be with Ricky,
and he's been with me, too.

31:49.500 --> 31:53.300
That's probably one of the reasons
why Ricky wants to be born again.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.900
Oh, is that right, Ricky?

31:56.900 --> 32:00.600
Again, I should not be
the focus of concern here.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.500
Maybe we should all
pray together, for Amy.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.000
Thank you for everything, Ben.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.200
I really just need my mom, though.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.300
Can I borrow your phone
so I can talk to my mom?

32:20.900 --> 32:22.300
Sure.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.100
He's slime. He's total slime.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.800
You know he's got a girlfriend?

32:39.800 --> 32:43.800
I mean, I guess you could call
her that, but she's a real slut.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.200
Don't say slut.
I don't like that.

32:47.200 --> 32:51.200
But, Dad, she is. She does it
with all the guys, not just Ricky.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.300
How do you know that? You're
a 12-year-old in middle school.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.300
I'm 13. I'm not a child.

32:57.900 --> 33:00.200
Amy's the only one that
treats me like an adult.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.900
How did Amy get
mixed up with this guy?

33:01.900 --> 33:04.200
He's in the band.
They went to band camp.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.200
I knew that French horn
would come to no good.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.600
That's too big an instrument for a girl.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.100
You think this was all caused
by a French horn?

33:11.100 --> 33:13.900
Don't get smart. I'm trying
to have a conversation here.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.900
So is your mom seeing someone?

33:19.400 --> 33:20.700
What, like a shrink?

33:20.700 --> 33:24.100
No, not like a shrink.
Like a guy. Is she dating?

33:24.300 --> 33:26.000
I'm just asking, that's all.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
No, I don't think
she's seeing anyone.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.500
So who's this slut?

33:32.400 --> 33:33.100
What?

33:33.100 --> 33:34.300
The drummer's girlfriend.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.900
Adrian. She's a majorette.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.300
Adrian?

33:40.500 --> 33:42.000
Lee.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.800
You know what?

33:46.600 --> 33:49.800
I probably shouldn't be here when
your mother gets home with Amy.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.800
I'm gonna give them
some time together.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.200
Three of you girls...
should have some time together.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.300
Come on, could I get
a little sympathy here?

34:03.700 --> 34:07.500
This girl I don't even know and care
nothing about is gonna ruin my life.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.900
Your life?
What about her life?

34:12.100 --> 34:14.400
Her life is her business,
and if she wanted to ruin her life,

34:14.400 --> 34:17.000
she should've chosen
someone else to do it with.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.600
You think Amy wanted this to happen?

34:20.100 --> 34:22.400
Adrian, of course
she wanted it to happen.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.600
She wants out of her life,

34:23.600 --> 34:27.300
and she doesn't care how she gets
out of her life as long as she gets out.

34:27.500 --> 34:31.199
She's... unloved.
She wants to be loved,

34:31.199 --> 34:33.800
by me, by the baby,
that stupid Ben guy.

34:33.900 --> 34:37.400
Anyone. Everyone.
She's got problems.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.600
I just got caught
in her problems.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.500
Like I don't have enough
problems of my own.

34:43.699 --> 34:44.900
Are you gonna marry her?

34:44.900 --> 34:47.699
Marry her? Is that what
you're worried about?

34:47.699 --> 34:50.100
Is that why you drove
her to that clinic?

34:51.400 --> 34:53.400
That's why you wanted her
to get an abortion.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.900
Don't be so dramatic. I drove there
'cause she asked me to drive her there.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.800
You told me she'd already
taken care of this.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.700
I said I thought she had.

35:01.700 --> 35:05.600
I knew you'd go running around with Grace
Bowman on a Save the Baby campaign.

35:05.600 --> 35:09.200
Like you care about an unborn child.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.400
Jeez, you don't care about
anything but yourself.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
You're such a liar,
you know that?

35:16.700 --> 35:22.100
Grace thinks I'm a nice guy, and you know
what, and around her, I am a nice guy.

35:22.300 --> 35:25.900
And you know what who are
you lying to now, me or you?

35:27.300 --> 35:31.500
Nice guy? Huh. No.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.300
You're not a nice guy,
and I'm not a nice girl.

35:35.300 --> 35:39.300
That's why you belong with me,
not Grace and certainly not Amy,

35:40.200 --> 35:43.600
even if she is
having your baby.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.800
Think I don't know that?

35:54.200 --> 35:58.800
Hey. Why do you care if Ricky's
gonna have a baby, anyway?

35:58.800 --> 36:01.500
- You're just friends, right?
- What do you want, Jack?

36:01.500 --> 36:04.200
You. I want you.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.300
I miss you.

36:05.300 --> 36:09.200
Good. I hope you miss me
for the rest of your life.

36:09.500 --> 36:13.200
Come on, Gracie. Reverend Stone said
he'd talk to your father about us.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.000
If you just give us
another chance...

36:15.000 --> 36:17.900
Don't take it personally.
I don't like cheaters.

36:17.900 --> 36:21.400
I don't. It's not about me,
it's about Adrian.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.400
Grace, I regret what I did,
and I apologize.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.400
I take full responsibility
for my actions,

36:27.400 --> 36:30.200
and that's more than Ricky's
ever gonna do for Amy Juergens.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.700
You don't know that.

36:32.800 --> 36:36.800
You're right, I don't. Maybe being friends
with you has made him a better person.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.500
You mean that?

36:38.500 --> 36:41.000
If anyone can change someone
for the better, it's you.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.500
You think that?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.700
I know I'm a better person
'cause of you.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.400
Let me know if you
change your mind, OK?

36:55.600 --> 36:58.300
You have to say somethin
It's your job.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.100
This is a little outside
my area of expertise.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.200
However...

37:04.200 --> 37:06.200
Yes, however...

37:06.200 --> 37:09.000
You do know that a marriage
between 15-year-olds

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
probably doesn't have
a chance in hell of surviving,

37:12.800 --> 37:15.600
especially when you add in the
complication of raising a child.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.500
That's a textbook response.
I'm looking for something human.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.500
I mean...This is me and my beloved
Amy we're talking about.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.200
I know that, Ben.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.400
But even if you and
Amy were 30 years old,

37:28.200 --> 37:30.100
it'd still be a difficult situation.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.400
So what you're saying
is the odds are better at 30?

37:33.400 --> 37:35.700
I'll marry her again
when I'm 30.

37:35.700 --> 37:38.800
I can't imagine her parents
would let her get married now.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.200
As in get married to me?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.500
You don't think they'll let her
get married to me,

37:42.500 --> 37:46.500
or to that...
fertile predator?

37:46.600 --> 37:48.800
To anyone, Ben.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.700
Why?

37:50.400 --> 37:53.800
They might consider it to be
making a second mistake.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.800
It's no mistake. I love her.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.700
Yeah, well, sometimes
that's just not enough.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.900
Huh. What are you
talking about?

38:03.100 --> 38:04.700
Yes, it is. It's enough.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.900
It's... everything.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.400
Oh. Oh, I get it.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.800
Get what?

38:14.800 --> 38:17.800
You know, I always
knew it. I sensed it.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.800
Who broke your heart,
counselor?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.300
No one broke my heart.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.500
I told you before, I can't discuss
personal matters with students.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.700
Can you get a pizza with a student
and his father? Leo Boykewich.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.900
Marc Molina.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.900
- I figured I'd find you here.
- How'd it go with Amy's dad?

38:36.900 --> 38:38.800
- You went to see Amy's dad?
- Yeah.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.400
Ehh, he'll come around.
How'd it go with Amy?

38:42.900 --> 38:45.000
Ehh, she'll come around.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.200
Ehh... and if they don't come around?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.500
If the man doesn't want his 15-year-old
daughter to marry a 15-year-old boy

38:51.500 --> 38:53.300
who's not the father of her baby?

38:54.000 --> 38:57.800
And if she doesn't wanna get married
at 15 just because she's having a baby?

38:58.400 --> 38:59.600
Who broke his heart?

38:59.600 --> 39:02.800
I don't know. He can't discuss
personal matters with me.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.000
Come on, we'll get some pizza.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.400
He'll shut his ears.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.600
15-year-olds getting married.
I'm doing my job.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.400
I'm sorry.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.500
I know you're sorry, Amy.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.400
And I'm sorry that this
happened to you, but it did.

39:34.300 --> 39:37.200
You can stop apologizing, OK?

39:37.200 --> 39:40.100
Things are what they are, and we're
just gonna have to figure them out.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.300
Please just let me marry Ben.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.500
Amy, it's not that you're too young.

39:48.500 --> 39:52.500
We're young, but, Mom, he loves me.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.700
And I love him.

39:54.700 --> 39:58.400
I know, and I believe it. I do.

39:58.400 --> 40:02.400
But you're in a difficult situation,and I don't
think you should let Ben rescue you.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.000
OK, If you're still in love in
a few years, that's wonderful.

40:06.300 --> 40:10.000
Get married when you're out of college
or when you've worked a few years.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.200
But right now, let's see if you can take
responsibility and handle this on your own.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.800
OK, I'll help you through this.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.100
But if he's willing
to help...

40:18.400 --> 40:22.100
There are consequences to
being rescued, believe me.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.500
What consequences?

40:23.500 --> 40:26.400
It's too soon to know yet,
but there are consequences.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.500
I don't get why you think that.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.500
I just don't think it, I know it.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.000
I've lived it.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.300
Your father rescued me, and I've
been trying to repay him ever since.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.200
How did Dad rescue you?

40:41.600 --> 40:42.700
Amy...

40:49.700 --> 40:51.300
I was pregnant.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.100
I have a brother or sister somewhere?

40:56.100 --> 40:57.000
No.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.600
Wait.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.000
Me?

41:04.700 --> 41:07.600
You got married to Dad 'cause
you were pregnant with me?

41:08.400 --> 41:11.300
We eloped six months
before you were born.

41:11.300 --> 41:14.500
We tell everyone else
it was 18 months, but...

41:14.500 --> 41:16.000
we lied.

41:16.300 --> 41:20.800
So we've actually only been
married for 15 years, not 16.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.700
So... when you found out
you were pregnant,

41:26.700 --> 41:29.300
you told your mother
you were already married?

41:29.300 --> 41:31.000
Yeah.

41:37.300 --> 41:41.100
Do you think you made
the right decision to marry Dad?

41:41.100 --> 41:43.800
I would hate it if you
made a mistake because of me.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.700
No, I think I made the right decision.

41:45.700 --> 41:49.700
I'm happy I married your father.
I'm happy that we had you.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.600
I'm even happy we have Ashley.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.600
Do you think I made
the right decision?

42:02.500 --> 42:06.800
Yeah, I think you made
the right decision for you.

42:10.100 --> 42:12.900
Mom, why wouldn't you
tell me about this?

42:14.500 --> 42:18.700
It was my little secret.
Mine and your father's.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.300
Some things are really hard
to talk about.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.900
Yeah.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.100
So, I guess we both
can work on that, huh?

42:27.100 --> 42:29.600
Yeah.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.100
I love you, Amy.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.300
I love you, too.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
So what are you most afraid of?

42:39.800 --> 42:40.900
That it'll hurt.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.600
Oh, it will.

42:44.100 --> 42:46.400
Don't worry. I'll be rigth there with you.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.900
What else?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.900
I don't want Ashley to have
problems because of me.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.800
I don't want anyone
to say anything to her.

42:53.800 --> 42:58.400
I just don't want her to think
that this is romantic at all

42:58.400 --> 42:59.600
just because of Ben.
