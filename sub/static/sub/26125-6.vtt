The story so far...

01:08.360 --> 01:12.239
<i>At Waterloo the war was won,
but George was lost.</i>

01:12.240 --> 01:14.589
<i>Survivors came home
with new babies,</i>

01:14.590 --> 01:16.179
<i>or new destinations.</i>

01:16.180 --> 01:18.119
<i>The regiment is under orders
for India.</i>

01:18.120 --> 01:20.879
<i>And Amelia had an offer
she had to refuse.</i>

01:20.880 --> 01:23.679
<i>I lost my husband.
I will not lose my son.</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:26.489
<i>Matilda took her revenge
from beyond the grave.</i>

01:26.490 --> 01:27.799
£100.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.119
You jumped the wrong way
there, Becky, my girl.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.199
<i>Undaunted, Becky came up with
her best plan yet...</i>

01:33.200 --> 01:36.599
This shall be our game room.
Here you will play all-comers
and all games.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.559
<i>..aiming straight
for her biggest prize.</i>

01:39.560 --> 01:43.919
Tonight, Becky works out
how to live well on nothing a year.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.559
It's easy!
It's Vanity Fair!

01:46.560 --> 01:49.249
A world where everyone
is striving...

01:49.250 --> 01:51.000
for what is not worth having.

Chapter 6: In WHICH A PAINTER'S
DAUGHTER MEETS A KING

02:36.250 --> 02:39.940
Lady Elizabeth Crawley.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.899
Lady... Betsy Crawley,

02:44.900 --> 02:47.579
nee... Horrocks.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.690
Ideas above your station, Miss?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.480
Begging your pardon, sir.

03:00.900 --> 03:04.419
Where are you going?
Come back here!

03:04.420 --> 03:08.139
Don't run away from me!
What are you doing?

03:08.140 --> 03:10.659
You won't out-run me!

03:10.660 --> 03:13.019
I'm fit as a fiddle, I am!

03:13.020 --> 03:14.619
Well, come here and show me, then!

03:14.620 --> 03:15.940
I bloody will...

03:21.560 --> 03:22.930
Sir Pitt?

03:30.910 --> 03:32.210
Sir Pitt!

03:37.510 --> 03:39.119
I wouldn't ask,
Mrs Crawley,

03:39.120 --> 03:41.559
but I'm late
with the school fees!

03:41.560 --> 03:43.900
Children are such
an expensive hobby!

03:44.720 --> 03:46.960
I shall rap the naughty
Colonel's knuckles for you.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.280
Why is the child downstairs?

03:57.620 --> 03:59.190
Papa wants me.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.740
He never met my boy...

04:05.800 --> 04:07.280
..and now father is dead.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.480
Sir Pitt gone.

04:12.230 --> 04:13.760
Dear old soul.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.700
He ran a good race, my love.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.320
Their milk and butter bill
alone comes to £200.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.959
How can I harass her for money now?

04:26.960 --> 04:28.719
While the house is in mourning?

04:28.720 --> 04:32.090
Husband, you'll ruin us
for the sake of a pretty smile.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.800
My dear Lord Steyne,

04:48.290 --> 04:51.679
I do not dare hope that we will
get more than a halfpenny.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.160
All Sir Pitt's estate
goes to the older son, obviously.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.964
Though he is a frightful miser,

04:56.965 --> 04:58.860
and the most complete nincompoop
you ever saw,

05:00.060 --> 05:02.819
though I suppose
nincompoopery runs in the family.

05:02.820 --> 05:04.120
Oh, Becky!
SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

05:06.240 --> 05:09.839
My husband is a clever old stick
in his way, I know.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.600
A nincompoop clever enough
to win a prize like you, dear lady.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.119
Poor blameless soul.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.610
It's because of me
he was cut off without a penny.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.159
Why else would we be sat here,

05:22.160 --> 05:24.800
sewing our mourning clothes
out of old curtain?

05:36.400 --> 05:40.020
I wonder if my little darling Rawdy
would like a bit of fresh air?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.419
I venture it's quite safe,
is it not, your lordship?

05:47.420 --> 05:48.720
Quite.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.200
Come along, Rawdy.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.149
When the boy goes to school,
you should get rid of the old maid.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.850
My loyal sheepdog
protects my reputation.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.639
Repelling all boarders?

06:17.640 --> 06:20.959
Even a friend of his Majesty?

06:20.960 --> 06:22.460
Perhaps not quite all.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.480
How much do they please you?

06:33.370 --> 06:34.679
Well enough.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.669
Well enough to wear
for the King?

06:36.670 --> 06:37.970
It's so sudden!

06:39.480 --> 06:42.720
Mrs Crawley, are you mine?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.180
I'll take that as a yes.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.060
Lord Steyne...

06:49.920 --> 06:51.679
..please forgive me,

06:51.680 --> 06:53.239
I cannot be rid of Miss Briggs

06:53.240 --> 06:55.639
because my feckless husband
owes her money.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.320
What?
How so?

06:59.400 --> 07:01.360
She came to us with a legacy
of...

07:03.040 --> 07:05.839
..of £1,200 from his aunt,

07:05.840 --> 07:09.239
and within a month, Rawdon had it
off the poor and trusting thing,

07:09.240 --> 07:11.960
and now the villain
has gone and spent it!

07:13.640 --> 07:15.799
What a clever little monkey it is,

07:15.800 --> 07:18.080
to extract diamonds
from one pocket...

07:19.920 --> 07:21.280
..and cash from the other.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.819
<i>On her own with him now.</i>

07:25.820 --> 07:28.740
<i>I don't mind how she gets it,
as long as she pays our wages
with it.</i>

07:54.560 --> 07:58.560
"Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live...

07:59.600 --> 08:01.719
"..and is full of misery.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.959
"He cometh up,
and is cut down like a flower.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.759
"He fleeth as he were a shadow.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.359
"We brought nothing into this world

08:11.360 --> 08:13.999
"and it is certain
we carry nothing out.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.559
"The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.120
"Blessed be name of the Lord."

08:22.760 --> 08:24.440
Welcome. Welcome.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.979
Welcome.

08:26.980 --> 08:29.840
Welcome, dear guests, to our house.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.679
My dear Lady Crawley,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.619
our ancestors could hope

08:35.620 --> 08:37.200
for no more gracious
chatelaine than you.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.680
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.919
The worst of it is the old man
has been letting

08:49.920 --> 08:52.639
the servants get away with murder.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.819
Standards have been
allowed to slip.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.640
Rack and ruin!
Look at these accounts!

08:58.960 --> 09:02.759
The entire estate
is tumbling about our ears.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.380
Thieves, one and all!

09:14.520 --> 09:17.999
You bring a breath of fresh air,
Lady Crawley.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.940
Oh, for the dear, innocent days
before I inherited all this.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.820
I simply had no idea how much money
it costs to be rich.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.840
I have to cut round the moth holes
of some of them.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.080
All I got was £100.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.680
And the speech about how poor he is.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.650
"I simply had no idea how much
money it costs to be rich!"

10:36.160 --> 10:38.479
I used to thrash my brother
at Headen,

10:38.480 --> 10:39.999
even though he was older than me.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.119
You didn't thrash him hard enough.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.679
It was foolish to hope your brother
would be generous.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.900
Queen's Crawley would have
been yours, not Martha's,

10:48.880 --> 10:51.360
if you would have married my father.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.470
Oh, dear, impossible.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.660
Fear not, husband.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.120
I can live well on nothing a year.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.879
See how they like us
now they're in charge,

11:17.880 --> 11:19.760
now they think we know our place.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.799
Your place is always the next place.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.119
Very good,
you've been paying attention.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.680
You want to know the plan?
Mmm.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.520
Lord Steyne...

11:31.880 --> 11:33.680
Oh, don't make that face,
Rawdon, please.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.039
The new king just appointed him
Master of the Powder Closet.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.959
It means our friend is one of the
most important lords of the land.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.639
It means he has the ear
of his Majesty.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.949
Think of it.

11:44.950 --> 11:46.620
Think of the opportunities
for us both.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.040
Don't fly too high, Becky.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.890
You'll leave the rest of us behind.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.880
No call for them these days,
watercolours.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.479
I know I'm not in the first
rank of artist, but perhaps...

12:24.480 --> 12:26.680
They all want silhouettes now.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.340
Right.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.880
That shawl you're wearing.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.240
It was a present.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.039
So many, Mrs Nathan.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.580
His Majesty is famous
for his fondness for feathers.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.740
Then I...

13:00.840 --> 13:02.320
..can make no objection.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.000
Charles, wait for me, wait! Stop!

13:18.600 --> 13:21.600
Mrs Nathan,
make room for my diamonds!

13:29.380 --> 13:30.680
Your Majesty!

13:41.380 --> 13:42.680
Good morning.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.919
Have you been buying things?

13:48.920 --> 13:50.220
For Georgie.

13:51.270 --> 13:52.579
Books and so on.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.360
He has a slight indigestion.

13:58.660 --> 14:00.159
What?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.519
- Daffy's elixir?
- To help him sleep.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.719
You had it, so did Jos,
it did you no harm.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.079
- It is poison.
- Poison!

14:08.080 --> 14:10.859
So this is the language
you use to your own mother?

14:10.860 --> 14:12.479
You're always arguing.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.279
Well, you shall
have no supper tonight,

14:14.280 --> 14:17.249
for I shall be busy being dragged
by the hairs at the Old Bailey!

14:17.250 --> 14:18.699
Georgie!

14:18.700 --> 14:20.940
Or your mother will have me
in the dock as a murderess!

14:22.600 --> 14:24.279
I have met with misfortunes...

14:24.280 --> 14:26.079
I'm sorry, Mama...

14:26.080 --> 14:28.759
I have sunk low in my life,
my servants have gone,

14:28.760 --> 14:30.959
I go everywhere on foot,
my life is in ruins,

14:30.960 --> 14:32.784
but at least I was never
a murderess,

14:32.785 --> 14:34.546
so thank you for that news!

14:34.547 --> 14:36.172
Please don't let us argue!

14:36.173 --> 14:37.799
<i>I'm not the one who's arguing!</i>

14:37.800 --> 14:39.180
Mother, stop!

14:42.360 --> 14:44.080
The Reverend Binny's come for tea.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.480
Gad!

14:55.320 --> 14:58.990
Mr Binny's... come to talk
about George's education.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.140
He is too young.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.979
Oh, just our own little school
at the vicarage.

15:03.980 --> 15:06.359
Perhaps George would benefit
from the society

15:06.360 --> 15:08.039
of other young gentleman.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.839
I mean to educate him at home.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.729
- I've bought books!
- Bought books?!

15:12.730 --> 15:16.040
Latin, mathematics...
I confess I'm a beginner myself.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.760
Mr Binny,
maybe I could interest you in...

15:28.850 --> 15:31.209
Oh, I already have enough coal,
more than enough, thank you, sir.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.249
Coal?
No,

15:33.250 --> 15:35.799
those days have passed.
I'm in wine now.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.479
Fine Madeiras, vintage...

15:37.480 --> 15:41.319
I abstain from the stronger spirits,
as I believe the Lord prefers.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.319
No, no, come.
I'm sure the good Lord approves...

15:44.320 --> 15:46.959
You spoil that child,
you should get down on your knees

15:46.960 --> 15:50.119
and pray to God to cleanse
your wicked and ungrateful heart.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.130
You and your selfish brother both.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.199
Jos?
What has Jos done?

15:55.200 --> 15:58.020
<i>A half decent claret
can travel the world.</i>

16:02.240 --> 16:04.330
Vile!
No. Ugh!

16:05.600 --> 16:07.270
That's not wine, it's vinegar.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.759
I give my father a perfectly good
allowance to just sit still

16:10.760 --> 16:14.479
and not make a mess,
and now he's a wine merchant! Ha!

16:14.480 --> 16:18.439
The kindly major
has another 30 cases in the cellar.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.399
He persuaded the governor and
half the regiments to order it, too.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.749
I'm a fool who meant to be kind.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.560
Well, Dob, I'm sure your name
is mud through all of Bengal.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.200
I say, Dob, that young lady
is giving us the most killing look.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.559
Will you look at my sister
enter a room?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.559
Is Glorvina not a heartbreaker,
Major Dobbin?

16:39.560 --> 16:43.759
Ha, I'm much too battered
and old for such a fine lady!

16:43.760 --> 16:45.920
Nonsense! She's perfect for you!
Wait now.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.799
- Look, when the music begins...
- I am the magistrate of Bengal!

16:49.800 --> 16:52.520
- You'd be doing me the most enormous favour.
- I do not dance!

17:03.320 --> 17:06.559
A fine figure of a woman,
is she not?

17:06.560 --> 17:09.239
She'll be worthy of the major.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.679
Compare my sister with that
poor Mrs Osborne,

17:11.680 --> 17:13.279
who couldn't say boo to a goose.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.920
I'll be sending for a new hat,
so I will.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.799
<i>My darling.</i>

17:25.800 --> 17:29.209
Whichever Lady Crawley
wore that particular brocade,

17:29.210 --> 17:32.119
she cannot possibly have
looked as adorable in it as you do.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.479
It's not, um...

17:33.480 --> 17:35.410
If you cannot carry it off,
nobody can.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.839
Do I know those splendid jewels?

17:38.840 --> 17:40.639
Hired, darling, of course.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.940
Here, let me.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.520
What a fine country we are...

17:49.280 --> 17:51.440
..where a little governess
may meet a king.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.840
This, madam, is the reason
you were put on God's Earth.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.480
- Will Mama ever come back?
- Of course, silly!

18:43.120 --> 18:46.669
Mrs Crawley will put all
the fine ladies to shame,

18:46.670 --> 18:47.970
as usual.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.120
Mrs Crawley.
Charming.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.719
There will be a great deal
of waiting about.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.559
We don't mind.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.279
I simply fear that you may
find the whole event

19:09.280 --> 19:12.799
an enormous waste of time,
Mrs Crawley.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.280
I am a daughter of a painter
and an opera girl.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.649
I've never hidden it,
but today, my lord,

19:18.650 --> 19:20.730
I've put it behind me forever.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.620
Always the charming optimist.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.999
We shan't let his wicked lordship
dampen our mood,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.879
shall we, Lady Steyne?

19:33.880 --> 19:36.879
Confound his politics, frustrate his
knavish tricks,

19:36.880 --> 19:39.840
- God save the King!
- Yes.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.490
Clever little thing.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.640
<i>Lord and Lady Castlemalney.</i>

20:01.560 --> 20:03.540
<i>Colonel and Mrs Brown.</i>

20:07.840 --> 20:09.930
<i>Lord and Lady Southdown.</i>

20:14.120 --> 20:15.879
<i>Lord and Lady Castle...</i>

20:15.880 --> 20:17.789
Remembering our wedding day, Becks?

20:17.790 --> 20:20.430
- Don't distract me.
- You in your muslin...

20:21.560 --> 20:22.860
..your straw bonnet...

20:23.360 --> 20:25.360
<i>Sir Thomas and Lady Jones.</i>

20:37.880 --> 20:40.040
<i>The Marquis and Marchioness Steyne.</i>

20:54.760 --> 20:56.880
<i>Colonel and Mrs Crawley.</i>

21:06.880 --> 21:08.680
I have arrived!

21:33.560 --> 21:34.860
My lord.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.559
Mrs Crawley.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.040
The cat who got the cream, hmm?

21:42.280 --> 21:43.769
Was it to your taste?

21:43.770 --> 21:45.999
It was the most wonderful day
of my life.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.300
Thank you, sir.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.650
And now, at last, does the little
woman have everything she wants?

21:53.240 --> 21:56.020
All I've ever wanted is to be
a counted and respectable lady.

21:57.090 --> 21:58.390
Aim higher.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.064
Ghastly party,
you missed nothing,

23:05.065 --> 23:06.880
I wish I'd come straight home.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.919
We should get you some lessons.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.160
Think how splendid it would be if
our guests found us playing duets.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.560
I don't blame you for wanting
to shine in that company...

23:30.000 --> 23:31.990
..you were born to shine there.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.620
But, Becky...

23:35.600 --> 23:38.769
..henceforward you will refuse
all invitations

23:38.770 --> 23:40.839
that come only for yourself.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.010
I will escort you
every time you go out.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.559
But you hate parties!

23:45.560 --> 23:47.540
You will entertain
only in my company.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.249
Oh, my dear, how gallant you are.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.559
How lovely that sounds,

23:55.560 --> 23:58.259
how much pleasanter it is
to have you beside me,

23:58.260 --> 23:59.560
than silly old Briggs.
Hm.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.759
It'll be like
when we were first married.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.160
How happy we shall be.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.660
Rawdon...

24:10.000 --> 24:11.440
..how happy we shall always be.

24:33.290 --> 24:34.974
<i>So, William is to be married,</i>

24:34.975 --> 24:36.649
and her sister is the very person

24:36.650 --> 24:39.529
destined to ensure Major Dobbin's
happiness.

24:39.530 --> 24:43.130
There! Is that not good news
from my old friend, Mrs O'Dowd?

24:48.330 --> 24:49.630
Yes.

24:50.330 --> 24:53.579
The Reverend Mr Binny
seems very fond of you...

24:53.580 --> 24:55.850
You know George can never be
replaced in my heart.

25:02.810 --> 25:04.419
Oh, Georgie, why don't you eat?

25:04.420 --> 25:06.009
Too many bones.

25:06.010 --> 25:07.310
And gristle, yes.

25:08.450 --> 25:11.189
Ugh! So now I mean to murder him
by choking, do I?

25:11.190 --> 25:12.490
Louisa!

25:13.510 --> 25:15.149
Bones and gristle
is what you get

25:15.150 --> 25:17.659
when you never manage to pay
the butcher, or the grocer.

25:17.660 --> 25:19.289
We must try, Louisa,

25:19.290 --> 25:22.339
to retain our kind
family feelings,

25:22.340 --> 25:24.489
in spite of our situation.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.779
There's our Georgie,
who might be rich,

25:26.780 --> 25:28.919
with a gold watch and chain,

25:28.920 --> 25:31.049
but for her selfishness.

25:31.050 --> 25:35.139
There's our son, who has
deserted his father in his old age.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.729
Jos!

25:36.730 --> 25:39.499
Who's left my dear,
dear, old man without a shilling

25:39.500 --> 25:41.729
and we shall end in the workhouse!

25:41.730 --> 25:43.989
- I shall write to Jos now.
- Please don't bother him.

25:43.990 --> 25:46.670
- He's not unkind, perhaps careless...
- Emmy, please, stop, stop.

25:52.490 --> 25:55.490
Jos sends me a cheque
as regular as clockwork.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.659
How else was I
to fund the coal business?

26:00.660 --> 26:02.010
Or the wine business?

26:03.370 --> 26:06.394
So all the money Jos sends...

26:06.395 --> 26:09.410
Goes to pay off a moneylender
in the city.

26:16.770 --> 26:19.010
Shall I be rich, Mama?
Shall I have a pony?

26:25.950 --> 26:27.250
Dear God.

26:27.610 --> 26:30.710
Have mercy upon me, give me
the strength to bear this trial.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.650
Is that Aunt Jane
coming to take me away?

26:48.910 --> 26:50.230
Can I have a pony?

26:51.250 --> 26:53.710
You can have
as many ponies as you like.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.310
Georgie!

27:16.250 --> 27:18.569
Say goodbye to your mother.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.770
Bye-bye, Mama.
I may visit you soon.

28:04.530 --> 28:07.570
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.529
A dinner invitation!
And what a dinner!

28:51.530 --> 28:53.969
This is the first day
of the rest of my life!

28:53.970 --> 28:57.019
- Well, being presented to the King...
- No, that was just a stepping stone.

28:57.020 --> 28:58.609
This is the prize, Briggs -

28:58.610 --> 29:01.739
I am launched onto the guest lists
of the greatest houses of London!

29:01.740 --> 29:03.689
Nothing is ever enough for you!

29:03.690 --> 29:06.050
ueWhat to wear?
Oh, what to wear, Briggs?!

29:13.250 --> 29:14.850
We could alter the blue silk!

29:15.920 --> 29:18.339
- What are you doing?
- I'm an Indian chief!

29:18.340 --> 29:20.950
Give me that, you naughty boy!

29:22.060 --> 29:25.139
- There, there, shush, don't cry.
- I hate you!

29:25.140 --> 29:27.019
The feeling is quite mutual,
I assure you.

29:27.020 --> 29:28.890
Becky! Don't!

29:30.170 --> 29:31.810
What do you know
about how to be a mother?

29:34.410 --> 29:35.710
<i>My Lord Steyne.</i>

29:39.050 --> 29:40.350
Briggs, hold the fort!

29:41.130 --> 29:42.430
Come on, Rawdy, quickly.

29:52.650 --> 29:54.450
Pride of place, I see.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.929
Oh, yes, well,

29:56.930 --> 29:59.209
Mrs Crawley begs your pardon...

29:59.210 --> 30:01.979
May I ask you, Miss Briggs,

30:01.980 --> 30:03.800
a rather personal question?

30:25.170 --> 30:27.529
What an accomplished
little devil it is.

30:27.530 --> 30:30.154
She beats all the women
I've ever seen

30:30.155 --> 30:32.779
in all the course of
a well-spent life.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.849
Miss Briggs?

30:34.850 --> 30:38.059
- Surely not!
- No, madam, you.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.590
You are the mistress of lies.

30:42.170 --> 30:46.050
And your husband is a much
cleverer fellow than I thought.

30:48.370 --> 30:51.299
Miss Briggs told you
we still owe her £600?

30:51.300 --> 30:54.490
Slightly less than the 1,200
you took from me.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.619
A wicked falsehood, my lord.

31:04.620 --> 31:05.929
But

31:05.930 --> 31:09.299
you don't know all I had
to suffer and bear in silence.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.699
It was my husband,
by savage threats,

31:11.700 --> 31:14.099
who forced me to double my request.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.569
Pardon the wrong,

31:15.570 --> 31:20.370
and pity a miserable,
miserable woman.

31:22.370 --> 31:23.810
This time, Rebecca...

31:25.970 --> 31:27.770
..pay the silly trout back.

31:30.210 --> 31:34.369
I have two other suggestions.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.729
- Suggestions, my lord?
- Conditions.

31:36.730 --> 31:40.609
Your son will go away to school.
The cost will be met.

31:40.610 --> 31:45.499
The sheepdog will find another
position. I have one in mind.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.499
You are more than generous.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.839
Dear lady,

31:48.840 --> 31:52.650
I merely clear obstacles
from our primrose path.

32:00.490 --> 32:03.049
It's a most kind offer
from a great friend of the family.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.939
But hang it, Becky,
his carriage is always at our door!

32:05.940 --> 32:07.569
And people love to talk.

32:07.570 --> 32:10.059
Let them! He is a nobleman of the
greatest station and talents,

32:10.060 --> 32:11.479
Master of the Powder Closet.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.890
I don't even know what that is.

32:15.250 --> 32:16.550
I shall miss him terribly.

32:17.570 --> 32:19.140
- Who?
- Our son!

32:22.530 --> 32:24.859
I wish you cared for Rawdy
just a little more.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.610
What a muddleheaded thing to say!

32:28.690 --> 32:30.130
He can come home on Sundays.

32:42.410 --> 32:44.094
Free trade, that's the answer.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.769
They won't wear it in the shires.

32:45.770 --> 32:49.139
We need to take advantage
of our dominance in Europe.

32:49.140 --> 32:51.290
Hear, hear.
Don't you agree, Colonel Crawley?

32:52.530 --> 32:53.890
As a veteran of Waterloo?

32:55.530 --> 32:59.850
I was at Waterloo myself.
I could tell you a tale or two.

33:02.730 --> 33:07.349
..Two layers and the suspicion,
ladies, of a waist!

33:07.350 --> 33:09.489
Darts, and everything!

33:09.490 --> 33:12.179
I believe our shoulders
are soon to get much wider,

33:12.180 --> 33:14.450
which I scarcely think
will flatter most of us.

33:15.930 --> 33:18.609
A monstrous infatuation!

33:18.610 --> 33:22.210
A gross insult to ladies of rank.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.169
Oh, God, Mamma, she's coming.

33:31.170 --> 33:34.059
I don't know what the world
is coming to, to be sure.

33:34.060 --> 33:36.570
Lady Blanche, Lady Bareacres.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.130
Possibly you don't remember me
from Brussels?

33:43.690 --> 33:45.329
I neither remember you, madam,

33:45.330 --> 33:47.459
nor wish now
to resume our intercourse.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.050
Barefaced cheek of it!

33:58.690 --> 34:01.770
They look at you
with rage in their hearts.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.050
They look at me with pity.

34:06.120 --> 34:09.728
But they would change places
with either of us in an instant.

34:09.730 --> 34:13.330
Your youth, my wealth...

34:18.610 --> 34:19.909
Will you play for me?

34:32.530 --> 34:35.529
AWFUL weather,
for this time of year.

34:35.530 --> 34:39.090
AWFUL, as though the world
were coming to an end.

34:42.969 --> 34:45.949
You determined long ago that
nothing should stand in your way.

34:46.940 --> 34:48.239
Not birth,

34:48.980 --> 34:50.280
not money,

34:50.969 --> 34:53.000
nor the opinions of others.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.900
I have brains and talent.

34:57.610 --> 34:58.910
It should be enough.

34:59.650 --> 35:00.950
Perhaps so.

35:02.050 --> 35:03.930
In another world from this one.

35:17.730 --> 35:19.030
Play on.

35:23.770 --> 35:25.549
I wonder how long I must wait

35:25.550 --> 35:27.849
for my guests to congratulate me

35:27.850 --> 35:32.530
on the standards of music
and beauty in my house.

35:35.130 --> 35:36.450
Bravo.

35:51.890 --> 35:56.699
You are the only
real lady in London.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.000
Thank you.

36:02.530 --> 36:03.830
Tell me, my dear...

36:06.330 --> 36:07.700
..do you love your husband?

36:12.690 --> 36:14.470
Perhaps not as much as I once did.

36:15.490 --> 36:17.100
Let nothing come between you.

36:19.610 --> 36:22.099
Children grow old,
friends grow cold,

36:22.100 --> 36:25.240
but husbands endure...

36:25.840 --> 36:27.170
if we let them.

36:32.970 --> 36:35.854
I could kill them all,
the pinch-faced old harpies!

36:35.855 --> 36:38.739
Dearest, really,
you can't force them to like me.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.889
You are worth
a hundred of one of them.

36:40.890 --> 36:43.050
It is better than being ignored.
Come, let's go home.

36:43.790 --> 36:45.370
No I'll... I'll walk.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.050
I need the fresh air.

36:50.370 --> 36:52.130
I'll be waiting for you...

36:57.890 --> 36:59.190
..booby.

37:18.130 --> 37:19.430
Who's there?

37:20.490 --> 37:21.930
Begging your pardon, Colonel.

37:22.290 --> 37:23.650
Oh, God.

37:24.010 --> 37:25.489
Bailiffs.

37:25.490 --> 37:26.799
How much is it this time?

37:26.800 --> 37:29.444
£136, six shillings,
and eight pence,

37:29.445 --> 37:32.090
at the suit of Mrs Nathan,
the dressmaker.

37:45.450 --> 37:48.130
Colonel Crawley.
As I live and breathe.

37:56.770 --> 37:59.419
There's five gents here
in the coffee room,

37:59.420 --> 38:01.289
or a doctor of divinity upstairs.

38:01.290 --> 38:04.209
Very kind, Mr Moss,
but no, thank you, I'll turn in.

38:04.210 --> 38:07.199
- Pen and ink for your letter, sir?
- I won't disturb her tonight.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.669
I'll write to my wife
in the morning.

38:08.670 --> 38:09.970
Very well. This way, sir.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.689
<i>"Dear Becky,
I hope you slept well.</i>

38:33.690 --> 38:34.999
<i>"Don't be alarmed,</i>

38:35.000 --> 38:36.939
<i>"when I don't bring you
"your chocolate this morning.</i>

38:36.940 --> 38:39.679
<i>"Last night I was nabbed again.</i>

38:39.680 --> 38:41.679
<i>"You'll find £70 in my desk.</i>

38:41.680 --> 38:45.039
<i>"Please drive to Mrs Nathan's
and ask her to give us more time,</i>

38:45.040 --> 38:47.439
<i>"and please bring me
some clean clothes.</i>

38:47.440 --> 38:48.740
<i>"Yours in haste...</i>

38:51.920 --> 38:55.200
<i>"PS: Don't be scared, but come soon,
and release me."</i>

38:56.840 --> 38:58.140
Morning, Colonel.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.720
You'll be out of here
in two shakes of a stick, sir.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.840
<i>Rebecca, where are you hiding?</i>

39:58.120 --> 39:59.800
Still no letter for me?

40:01.080 --> 40:04.080
Sorry, Colonel.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.400
Bring me pen and ink again.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.919
Dear God, Rawdon.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.840
For not even £130?

40:36.680 --> 40:38.119
Have you, um...

40:38.120 --> 40:39.499
The bill is paid.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.800
I believe that means
you're free to go.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.120
I am forever in your debt.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.920
Rebecca?

40:51.580 --> 40:53.000
You wrote to her first?

40:55.880 --> 40:57.240
Never replied.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.360
Just get home, old boy.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.920
I'm innocent.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.839
Before God, Husband, I am innocent!

41:58.840 --> 42:01.479
- Tell him! Say it!
- Innocent.

42:01.480 --> 42:05.280
When every trinket you wear
on your body I gave to you.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.039
Oh, I see what this is.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.439
The pair of you mean
to lay a trap for me,

42:14.440 --> 42:17.799
to con me out of even more money
than the thousands of pounds

42:17.800 --> 42:20.040
I have already given
to this... whore...

42:21.760 --> 42:24.159
..which, no doubt, Colonel Crawley,

42:24.160 --> 42:26.559
you have already spent.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.159
Liar.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.719
- You don't frighten me.
- Coward!

42:30.720 --> 42:32.360
Make way, sir.

42:34.540 --> 42:35.920
Villain!

42:44.400 --> 42:46.840
How could I turn our patron away?

42:50.080 --> 42:51.380
Take them off.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.620
All of them!

43:01.760 --> 43:03.060
Pimp!

43:04.200 --> 43:05.500
Get out of my house!

43:31.080 --> 43:32.479
Where's the key?

43:32.480 --> 43:34.760
Lost.
Don't!

43:47.880 --> 43:49.180
Thousands!

43:52.400 --> 43:53.700
Good God!

43:56.960 --> 43:59.680
£100 of this
would have made me a free man!

44:04.320 --> 44:05.720
I shall pay Briggs.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.080
She was always kind to the boy.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.280
The rest I shall
send back to your...

44:16.520 --> 44:17.829
..to him.

44:17.830 --> 44:19.130
No.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.880
Becky...

44:26.880 --> 44:30.080
..we always shared
everything with you.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.400
Acredito que te amei.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.240
You don't even love your own child.
