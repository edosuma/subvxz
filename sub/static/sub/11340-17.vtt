00:13.290 --> 00:17.112
Everyone says that love
happens when you least expect it.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.453
I guess it's true,
because when I met you,

00:22.540 --> 00:24.952
love was the last thing on my mind.

00:27.540 --> 00:30.247
I'd find myself sneaking out to see you.

00:34.290 --> 00:37.373
I'd put fancy makeup on
just to make you smile.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.571
I still feel the touch of your skin.

00:47.620 --> 00:51.112
You help me get through every night.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.371
You give my life purpose.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.998
That's why no matter
what people try to do...

01:05.420 --> 01:07.786
Nothing is going to keep us apart.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.240
Just the guy I'm looking for.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.820
Hey, what's up, Kevin?

02:17.830 --> 02:19.821
Can we talk?

02:20.920 --> 02:22.319
Is Penelope okay?

02:22.330 --> 02:25.117
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's perfect.
In fact, that's why I'm here.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.248
Look, I know you're Penelope's
boo and she's your baby girl.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.320
And what I'm about to embark on
involves the keen insight

02:30.330 --> 02:31.536
of somebody who knows
her inside and out.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.371
And no matter how much
therapy I've gone through

02:33.380 --> 02:35.610
trying to understand your relationship,
I know you're that person.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.417
Okay, Kevin, land your plane.

02:41.380 --> 02:43.871
I want to propose to Penelope,
and I need your help.

02:51.710 --> 02:54.998
Please, I'm not asking for your blessing,
I'm asking for your advice.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.822
Okay, should I do it over a couple tacos
and a nice can of Red Bull?

02:59.580 --> 03:02.879
All right. Should I take her to New York
and do it at the Statue of Liberty?

03:04.380 --> 03:06.029
Maybe I should serenade
her at the roundtable

03:06.040 --> 03:07.416
right before you guys present a case.

03:08.670 --> 03:11.992
No, actually, that may not work,
given the gruesome nature of your job.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.823
Oh, uh... How about the high tech room,
and I pop up on an HD mainframe?

03:16.830 --> 03:19.913
Kevin, seriously,
I got a meeting I gotta get to.

03:22.380 --> 03:25.247
Derek, please.
Come on, bro, this is important.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.950
Hi, yeah, what was that about?

03:29.750 --> 03:31.456
You know, he just wanted to talk.

03:31.460 --> 03:32.870
About what?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.108
Just guy stuff.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.416
-Me?
-I didn't say that.

03:36.420 --> 03:37.910
Garcia, I'd like to get started.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.205
Yes, sorry.

03:39.540 --> 03:43.499
Two couples were found shot to death

03:43.500 --> 03:45.912
in the Delridge neighborhood
of Seattle, Washington.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.571
The first was Mark Daniel
and Ben Priestly.

03:48.580 --> 03:49.820
They were found dead
in their living room.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.617
The second was John and Heather
Miller, they lived four miles away,

03:52.620 --> 03:55.077
and they were found last
night dead in their hallway.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.536
-Their daughter found them?
-Yeah.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.110
She had snuck out
to see her boyfriend.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.031
When she got back, they were dead.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.747
Two double homicides
must be rare in that area.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.117
What makes it weirder is that there was
no Sign of robbery or sexual assault.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.873
-The shooter used a .22.
-Shot them execution-style.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.030
He's experienced,
he used a pillow as a silencer.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.325
You don't want to wake the neighbors.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.707
You know, these crimes
seem to lack the emotionality

04:14.710 --> 04:16.666
that we typically see
in personal cause homicides.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.991
_ lV_lost executions
are crImInal enterprise-related.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.161
The probability of these couples
being involved in the exact same

04:21.170 --> 04:22.376
illegal activity is kind of low.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.610
There's no way these were random
victims of opportunity.

04:24.620 --> 04:25.996
Garcia, no sign of forced entry?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.319
None that the authorities
have found, no.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.615
So it's a home invasion.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.702
Or our UnSub is using
some kind of ruse.

04:30.710 --> 04:32.871
Either way,
they're calculating and dispassionate.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.411
And no appreciation
for chenille throw pillows.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.076
Well, the violent and targeted
nature of these crimes

04:38.080 --> 04:39.160
suggests that there could be more.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.706
Wheels up in 30.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.457
When people look back
and talk about us,

04:46.040 --> 04:47.996
they're gonna say what I did was right.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.118
That we were ahead of our time,
we were pioneers.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.168
I get to pick the movie next time.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.372
Well, it's better than the last 3D thing
we saw at the Imax.

04:58.830 --> 05:01.162
Come on, Gayle.
You look cute in those glasses.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.032
Am I any less cute
when I have a migraine?

05:07.290 --> 05:08.450
Bnan?

05:10.080 --> 05:12.958
Who are you

05:13.210 --> 05:14.700
Please don't hurt us.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.201
There's money and jewelry upstairs.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.701
And when they ask me
why I did it...

05:22.540 --> 05:23.871
I'll tell them the truth.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.069
It's because I love you.

05:31.380 --> 05:33.371
I love you, Tommy Brown.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.707
It was once said
that love IS gIVIng someone

06:13.710 --> 06:16.918
the ability to destroy you
but trusting them not to.

06:17.580 --> 06:20.663
All right, let's go over victimology.
Each of the victims was a professional.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.376
The domestic partners
were lawyers,

06:22.380 --> 06:23.950
and the Millers worked
at a tech company.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.700
But P.D. couldn't find any overlap.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.951
Both couples were really
enjoyed by their peers,

06:27.960 --> 06:30.201
neighborhood watch, volunteered in
community groups, you name it.

06:30.210 --> 06:32.201
This was a straight-up execution.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.246
Kneeling on the ground,
placing a pillow behind the head.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.410
It seems ritualistic.

06:35.420 --> 06:36.785
Or he's simply
taking precautions.

06:37.170 --> 06:38.876
Some of the vics were shot in the leg.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.457
They probably were trying
to defend themselves,

06:41.460 --> 06:43.997
and this was the only way our UnSub
could get them to the floor.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.117
Well, the scene's pretty clean, except
what's left on the floor and the pillows.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.872
Garcia, how are each of the
couples' financials?

06:48.880 --> 06:50.324
Yo. I wish mine were this good.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.070
What about the Millers'
daughter, Abby?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.913
She sneaks out to see her boyfriend?
That's kind of convenient.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.069
The PD. confirms her story.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.741
A neighbor saw her
kissing her boyfriend

06:58.750 --> 07:00.240
in his baclqard
during the time of the kills.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.707
You guys, something just happened.
Another couple, the same area,

07:02.710 --> 07:03.950
shot to death in their house.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.245
This is turning into a spree.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.411
Targeting potentially unrelated couples.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.456
And the time between
the murders is accelerating.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.280
Prentiss, you and JJ go talk to Abby.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.076
Dave and I will go to
yesterday's crime scene.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.411
Morgan and Reid,
you go to the new one.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.457
SEATI'LE, WASHINGTON

07:18.670 --> 07:21.070
I mean, we get our occasional DWI,

07:21.330 --> 07:23.787
a few kids egging a house
on Halloween.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.746
But people shot like this...

07:27.120 --> 07:28.917
It looks like one of those cable shows.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.490
Well, again, there's no sign of break-in.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.456
But all the windows were unlocked,
so who knows?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.530
They got it right there.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.109
They still had their keys out.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.667
So they were
caught off guard.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.075
The house is childproofed.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.742
It must have been a relative
or a neighbour's kids.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.069
They didn't have any children.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.780
The UnSub probably sat right here.

07:52.790 --> 07:55.281
Had a soda. _
We should pull the cans for prints.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.702
The reading light's still on, so the
UnSub was looking for something.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.780
But there aren't any magazines
or newspapers around,

07:59.790 --> 08:02.031
which means it was important enough
to take him out of killing mode.

08:02.540 --> 08:05.327
For someone on a spree,
this UnSub sure is patient.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.742
If he's so patient,
what is it that he's waiting for?

08:08.380 --> 08:10.826
Hello?
Do not put me on hold again.

08:10.830 --> 08:13.492
All I need you to do
is confirm an address for me, please.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.708
-Miss

08:16.710 --> 08:18.166
Want to stand up for me?

08:18.170 --> 08:20.616
Stand up. Get up.
Let's get your jacket up.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.746
-I'm wet.
-I know.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.035
Can I touch it?

08:24.040 --> 08:25.371
I'd rather you didn't.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.036
You're so lucky.

08:27.290 --> 08:30.168
A child's the greatest
gift of love anyone can ask for.

08:31.830 --> 08:33.036
Excuse me.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.495
Are you okay, sweetie?

08:39.580 --> 08:42.037
I keep running it over in my head.

08:43.580 --> 08:47.289
Maybe if I were at home, I...
I would have heard something.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.916
There's nothing you could have done.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.115
They'd just finished watching TV.

08:55.710 --> 08:59.419
Listen, did your parents
have any problems with anyone?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.996
Were there people
who didn't like them?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.706
No. Everyone loved them.

09:07.620 --> 09:11.909
They'd have these get-togethers
and there'd be,

09:11.920 --> 09:13.740
you know, a hundred
people in the living room.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.661
And where did they meet
all of these people?

09:15.960 --> 09:17.416
Community groups

09:17.420 --> 09:18.569
At church.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.529
Which one?

09:20.540 --> 09:21.780
Holy Worship?

09:21.790 --> 09:24.327
They went twice a week,
and the wife taught Sunday school.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.378
That's where Garcia said
last night's Victims went as well.

09:26.380 --> 09:27.608
What about the first victims?

09:27.620 --> 09:29.668
No. But they volunteered
at a community center.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.537
So we've got two couples
from the same congregation killed.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.825
That may be where
they met the UnSub.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.115
And he turned on them.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.168
I'll send Reid and Rossi to the church,
see what they can find.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.666
No.

09:43.380 --> 09:46.952
No, Mom, I didn't put it in
too much light or overwater it.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.917
Listen, I gotta go.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.458
Well, don't call me an orchid killer.
I didn't kill it.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.371
Bye.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.110
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.747
Oh, my, what a pretty dress.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.110
Thanks. I just got this.

10:01.420 --> 10:04.662
I didn't know if it was too much for me,
but who cares, right?

10:04.670 --> 10:05.989
Yeah, who cares?

10:07.460 --> 10:08.529
What can I do for you?

10:08.790 --> 10:12.169
The Millers and the Gilberts both
participated in our foster program.

10:12.170 --> 10:15.116
It's a local joint venture we have
with the community center.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.071
Maybe it's the same one where
our first victims volunteered.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.615
Well, I'm with social services
and I was in the neighborhood,

10:20.620 --> 10:21.951
so I figured I'd come by.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.706
I usually get a call
ahead of time for that.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.575
Well, that explains why
their homes were childproofed.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.070
They sometimes had kids
in their custody.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.377
But if they were foster parents,

10:29.380 --> 10:32.031
it would have come up when Garcia
checked their backgrounds.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.708
Oh. If this is a problem,
I'll just set up a time to see you later.

10:35.710 --> 10:36.916
Great.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.956
I'll have to report
denial of entry, of course.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.781
No, just come on. It's fine.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.706
What if you get a child
who needs a home immediately

10:48.710 --> 10:50.450
but no foster families are available?

10:50.460 --> 10:52.451
Is there _some sort of_
emergency list or something?

10:52.460 --> 10:55.372
Yeah. They could take the kids
for just a night or a weekend.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.031
And both couples were on that list, too.

10:58.420 --> 10:59.660
We'll need a copy of that.

10:59.670 --> 11:00.785
We also need the names of

11:00.790 --> 11:02.075
anyone who would have had access to it.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.916
Our UnSub's following that list.

11:04.420 --> 11:07.457
Our last couple had a baby
in their possession two days ago.

11:07.460 --> 11:10.076
That sheds some light on the .22.
That gun is easy to handle.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.286
And not very loud.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.326
You know, add that to no forced entry,

11:13.330 --> 11:15.821
I don't think the pillows
were used to minimize sound.

11:15.830 --> 11:16.990
They were used to stay clean.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.456
Which means this UnSub
might be a woman.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.781
Who's most likely had a connection
to the foster system.

11:20.790 --> 11:21.996
Or she simply wants a kid.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.207
Then why not just
snatch one off the street?

11:24.210 --> 11:27.282
This is maternal desire.
These couples took in babies.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.372
Maybe she lost her own
or can't conceive.

11:29.380 --> 11:32.827
So she probably killed those people
because when she got to their home,

11:32.830 --> 11:34.661
they didn't have a child
in their possession.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.786
She'll keep killing until she finds one.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.321
So when was Johnny
last in your house?

11:43.830 --> 11:45.878
He was moved a couple days ago.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.871
I almost cried.
You should have seen me.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.489
Where was he placed?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.161
It should be in the file.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.537
But I don't have that information here.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.417
I'm sure my social worker must have it.

12:01.750 --> 12:02.910
What are you doing?

12:02.920 --> 12:05.992
Well, this is a gun,
and inside of it are what we call bullets.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.569
What do you want?

12:07.580 --> 12:09.571
I want to know where Johnny is.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.781
Well, I just told you.
They put him in a home.

12:12.790 --> 12:13.825
Which home?

12:18.750 --> 12:20.240
It's probably on the desk.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.740
Then hurry up.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.076
Where is it

12:33.420 --> 12:35.160
It's on the last page.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.451
Do you want me to call her for you?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.076
No. I want you
to take off your necklace.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.536
-My what?
-Your necklace.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.115
Now take off your dress.

12:52.750 --> 12:53.785
Take it off!

12:55.290 --> 12:56.609
Please don't hurt me.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.820
I've never hurt anybody in my life.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.740
Kneel on the ground.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.609
I was raped once before.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.825
Oh, for God's sake, shut up.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.490
Our Father who art in heaven...

13:18.500 --> 13:20.036
-Stop that.
-Hallowed be thy name...

13:20.040 --> 13:21.246
-Stop that!
-Thy kingdom come...

13:21.250 --> 13:23.241
-Stop that!
-Thy will be done,

13:23.250 --> 13:24.956
-on Earth as it _is in heaven.
-I'm warning you.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.077
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,

13:28.080 --> 13:30.378
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

13:30.380 --> 13:31.665
Shut up!

13:31.670 --> 13:34.286
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.871
That's enough!

13:46.830 --> 13:49.287
She was on _ _
the emergency foster family list, too.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.417
But she hadn't had a kid for 48 hours.

13:51.420 --> 13:53.411
The UnSub must have
some kind of ruse.

13:53.420 --> 13:54.785
She gets in pretty easily.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.576
Well, she's definitely
an organized spree killer.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.287
She changed her MO. She stripped
the woman down to her underwear

13:59.290 --> 14:00.700
and took her clothes.

14:00.710 --> 14:02.280
We'll check
for sexual assault.

14:02.290 --> 14:04.281
I wouldn't waste too much time.

14:04.290 --> 14:07.578
Female serial killers are agenda driven,
not sexually compulsive.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.706
What's the agenda here?

14:08.710 --> 14:11.918
She left the woman in her heels and
her slip. It could be humiliation.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.615
Why didn't she do this
to any of the others?

14:15.580 --> 14:17.536
Well,
she's definitely escalating.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.872
When she found out the woman didn't
have a child, she got mad.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.701
Look at this. She gave up on the pillow,
then sprayed the body with bullets.

14:22.710 --> 14:25.326
_ So he_r maternal desire
is causmg her to unravel.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.956
She's killing this frequently
because she's desperate.

14:29.290 --> 14:30.780
She may have told somebody
that she's pregnant

14:30.790 --> 14:32.166
and now she's got to produce a kid.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.779
Come on.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.701
Is it Garcia?
-Yep.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.166
Why aren't you answering it?

14:40.540 --> 14:41.871
Complicated.

14:41.880 --> 14:46.249
Derek Morgan, this is the 67th message
that I have left you,

14:46.250 --> 14:50.118
and if you do not call me back, I will
have no choice but to show everyone

14:50.120 --> 14:53.169
that nude photo of you from art class,
and not the good one, either.

14:53.170 --> 14:54.455
I'm being serious.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.917
What were you and Kevin
talking about yesterday?

14:56.920 --> 14:59.457
I'm freaking out here.
Please, call me back. Bye.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.825
-Penelope?
-Hey!

15:01.120 --> 15:02.701
-You okay?
-Yes, okay.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.871
Yes, I am okay. I am fine.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.279
-Are you sure?
-No!

15:06.290 --> 15:07.951
What were you and Morgan
talking about?

15:10.420 --> 15:12.661
-When Yesterday.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.450
Um...

15:16.580 --> 15:17.877
I don't remember.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.575
That's funny,
'cause you guys never talk.

15:19.830 --> 15:22.162
Well, now, that, that is untrue.

15:22.170 --> 15:23.205
That's totally true.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.952
Morgan is my friend. You are my friend.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.706
You and Morgan are not friends.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.530
-It's complicated.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:30.540 --> 15:32.201
You know, we were just
talking about guy stuff.

15:32.210 --> 15:33.575
Yeah

15:33.580 --> 15:34.706
Um...

15:37.040 --> 15:38.667
We were talking about basketball.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.661
Morgan hates watching basketball.
He's a hockey fan.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.456
Yes. Yes, yes.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.160
Yes, I know.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.075
In fact, he was just telling me

15:48.080 --> 15:50.412
about how one of the first
professional hockey leagues

15:50.420 --> 15:52.957
was started by black players
in Nova Scotia in 1895.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.535
I know. Who knew?

15:56.460 --> 15:57.575
Do you want to get some dinner?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.496
No.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.991
We're about to deliver the profile
and I have to stay here.

16:10.830 --> 16:13.162
We believe the UnSub we're looking for
is a white female,

16:13.170 --> 16:15.616
who, based upon the organizational
level of the crimes,

16:15.620 --> 16:17.417
is in her late 30s to early 40$.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.991
We also believe that
something in the last few days

16:20.000 --> 16:22.742
has triggered her to think
that killing was the only way

16:22.750 --> 16:24.661
she was gonna be able
to obtain a child.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.953
Consequently, the foster families that
did not have a child in their care

16:28.960 --> 16:30.780
when she visited, became her victims.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.452
Because all of these families recently
had children in their homes,

16:34.460 --> 16:37.327
we believe our UnSub
is motivated by maternal desire.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.824
Maternal desire is the profound
emotional need to mother a baby.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.378
This stems from either
the tragic loss of her own child

16:44.380 --> 16:46.325
or the inability to have one at all.

16:46.330 --> 16:49.618
This UnSub may also fantasize that
someone else's baby belongs to her,

16:49.880 --> 16:52.110
and this emotion feels
beyond her control.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.283
A woman who miscarries sometimes
prOJects onto someone else's baby

16:55.290 --> 16:57.110
and then sets out to take that child.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.452
This may cause our UnSub
to do something drastic.

17:01.290 --> 17:04.248
Like commit a cesarean abduction
or kidnap a random kid.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.991
The speed at which
the kills are occurring

17:11.000 --> 17:13.286
suggests that our UnSub
is frustrated and devolving.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.497
This is causing her to go on a spree,

17:15.500 --> 17:19.072
which usually ends in a very high
body count and suicide by cop.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.071
So we should look at anyone
who is pregnant

17:21.080 --> 17:22.957
and suffering from
postpartum psychosis.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.497
We also need to check
those who worked for

17:25.500 --> 17:27.991
or had access to
the local foster system.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.449
Thank you. Any questions?

17:39.750 --> 17:43.493
Okay, here we go.
There you are, my big guy.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.030
Get in the car
or I will shoot you right here.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.576
Oh, my God. Okay.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.075
Okay.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.699
Hi.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.450
Okay, now, start the car, Karen.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.245
How do you know my name?

18:00.170 --> 18:01.706
Oh, I know everything about you.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.536
You're single,
you made six figures last year.

18:04.790 --> 18:08.032
Decided to adopt a baby because
everything in your life had worked out

18:08.040 --> 18:09.530
except for your broken ovaries.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.700
What do you want?

18:10.710 --> 18:13.372
You'll see.
This'll be over sooner than you think.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.286
Don't worry, it's okay.

18:15.290 --> 18:18.168
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right. Yeah.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.376
Drive, Karen.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.611
So I checked the pregnant employees
working with the foster program.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.248
No indication of maternal desire
or postpartum psych05is.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.615
What about those
who were fired or quit?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.497
Only two were pregnant,
but they also had healthy children.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.740
The rest didn't fit the profile.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.820
Okay, we need to warn other parents
in the foster system.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.741
The police department's
already making phone calls.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.241
This woman is erratic and unstable.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.741
What about someone who was recently
released from a mental institution?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.537
That would explain taking
the last victim's clothes.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.826
When you enter a facility,
they strip you of your identity.

18:45.830 --> 18:47.206
And when you get out
of an institution,

18:47.210 --> 18:48.871
the first thing you do
is try to get your identity back.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.074
I'll get Garcia.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.379
Please, whatever you want
I will give you.

18:53.380 --> 18:56.076
Is he still drinking formula,
or is he on to milk?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.036
I have stocks, and I have money.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.702
I wanted to breast-feed him,
but they took him away.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.457
You know what happens when
a mommy can't get rid of her milk?

19:03.880 --> 19:08.374
The pain is excruciating.
They give you this pill that dries you up.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.202
That's the most unnatural thing
in the whole world, little Johnny.

19:12.460 --> 19:13.745
His name is Ben.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.115
It's Johnny!

19:15.540 --> 19:17.076
You changed it.

19:18.460 --> 19:21.076
Can he eat peanuts?
Because his dad is highly allergic.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.286
His dad?

19:23.210 --> 19:24.279
Who are you?

19:24.620 --> 19:27.248
I'm his mother,
and I'm here to take him back.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.952
Hi, baby. Mommy's here.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.200
Yeah.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.574
Pull over.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.958
Penny G has checked
all local mental institutions

19:39.960 --> 19:41.916
and there are no women
that fit that description

19:41.920 --> 19:43.376
that have been released
in the last two weeks.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.871
All right, check Oregon,
Idaho, even Montana.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.372
Okay, there are four women
that match the profile,

19:49.380 --> 19:50.608
and none of them are preggers.

19:50.620 --> 19:53.418
Another woman's been shot,
three blocks from here.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.739
She has a fairly limited comfort zone.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.162
All right, Reid, work the list.
I'll take Rossi and Prentiss with me.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.702
Since you couldn't go out to dinner,
I thought I would bring dinner to you.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.240
You never bring me dinner.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.377
Vegan pad thai, your favorite.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.787
You had to go all the way
to Adams Morgan to get me that.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.161
I thought I would just
do something special.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.870
-And you're sweating.
-No, I'm not.

20:16.170 --> 20:17.706
Why are you acting so weird?

20:17.710 --> 20:19.371
I'm not acting weird,
you're acting weird.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.415
I'm acting weird because you're...

20:20.750 --> 20:22.991
I don't have time for this, okay?
I need to get to work.

20:23.330 --> 20:24.661
Okay, I'll just stand in the back.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.321
No! No, I can't concentrate
if you're here.

20:27.830 --> 20:28.990
Well...okay.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.575
I'll put the food in the fridge,

20:31.580 --> 20:34.117
but maybe you have time
to take a nibble on this?

20:37.040 --> 20:38.530
This is a red velvet cupcake,

20:38.540 --> 20:40.997
and you only give them to me
on special occasions.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.707
We'll talk later.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.991
BP's 90 over 60.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.321
-Can she talk?
-No. Her pressure's falling.

20:57.670 --> 20:59.160
Check the car. I'll go with her.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.957
We'll put out an APB on our UnSub.
She might be on foot.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.876
- -It's okay, Johnny.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.491
Mommy's gonna take care
of everything.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.701
No, no. Shh, shh.

21:11.710 --> 21:16.704
Relax. We're almost there, honey.
Almost there. Promise.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.031
That's the first time
she shot someone in public.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.110
She also didn't kill her.
Maybe she panicked and ran off.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.112
Oh. Or she intentionally spared her

21:28.120 --> 21:29.701
because she had what she wanted,
a kid.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.951
Rossi, look at all this. The baby mirror.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.699
And the stains.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.246
Yeah, that could be formula.

21:35.540 --> 21:38.282
Our UnSub most likely
transferred the child

21:38.290 --> 21:40.417
_ into her own car
right here on the street.

21:40.420 --> 21:41.705
So that means she fits in,

21:41.710 --> 21:43.826
but the question is, where
did the carjacking happen?

21:44.710 --> 21:47.031
Well, she was coming
from the doctor's office.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.371
The kid was sick.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.378
Okay, but why leave the victim
so close to the police station?

21:51.380 --> 21:52.665
Well, she might not have known.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.786
She's erratic and probably
on a schedule.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.997
So her desperation
outweighed rationale.

22:20.790 --> 22:21.916
Here.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.286
Maggie.

22:46.380 --> 22:47.916
What are you doing here?

22:47.920 --> 22:48.989
I got out.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.611
It wasn't supposed to happen
for another six months.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.108
Who's this?

22:57.380 --> 22:58.779
It's Johnny, honey.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.569
Our Johnny.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.074
Yeah.

23:02.790 --> 23:04.951
We're gonna be a family, honey.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.109
No one can stop us now.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.820
Hey, let me look at you.

23:29.330 --> 23:30.820
Did you buy this for me?

23:30.830 --> 23:33.321
Yeah. It took me a long time to find it.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.376
We have to hurry.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.320
Where are we going?
We could just go upstairs.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.412
My mom won't be home for hours.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.990
No, we're getting out of town, Tommy.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.377
What are you talking about?

23:45.380 --> 23:47.666
We're leaving here. Is there anything
else you're gonna need?

23:48.830 --> 23:50.491
Well, I can't just take off.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.706
Sure you can.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.321
I've spent the last four days
getting everything ready.

23:55.330 --> 23:59.778
I got us a house that has a yard
and a Jacuzzi tub,

23:59.790 --> 24:02.167
just like that hotel we used to go to.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.280
What about my mom?

24:08.290 --> 24:12.829
Your mom i_s_the_reason_ that we're
in this p05ition in the first place.

24:12.830 --> 24:15.412
She sent me to jail, Tommy.
Remember?

24:15.420 --> 24:18.116
She's sick! Remember what she said
about me on the television?

24:18.120 --> 24:21.032
She said I was a predator.
Am I an animal, Tommy?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.371
-No.
-No.

24:22.380 --> 24:25.827
Come on, baby.
I'm tired of writing letters.

24:25.830 --> 24:29.379
We can't go back to
sneaking around anymore. Okay?

24:29.830 --> 24:31.115
Okay.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.786
Ignore that.

24:34.790 --> 24:35.996
Tommy, it's Julie!

24:38.330 --> 24:40.412
-Who's Julie?
-A friend.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.569
Are you doing her?

24:41.920 --> 24:43.035
What?

24:46.750 --> 24:48.286
What's that for?

24:48.290 --> 24:50.531
No one is gonna
come between us again, Tommy.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.376
What...

24:57.670 --> 24:59.069
Did you get anything
from Karen?

24:59.080 --> 25:01.071
She's in surgery for two more hours.
What about you?

25:01.080 --> 25:03.241
We think the UnSub carjacked Karen

25:03.250 --> 25:05.707
at a paediatrician's office
two blocks from where she was shot.

25:05.710 --> 25:08.531
Witnesses said that a woman
with blond hair, early 405,

25:08.540 --> 25:10.326
was waiting on a bench for an hour

25:10.330 --> 25:12.207
around the same time
Karen took her kid there.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.780
We're working up
a composite now.

25:13.790 --> 25:15.371
Dozens of women and their children

25:15.380 --> 25:17.200
were in and out
of the building in the morning,

25:17.210 --> 25:18.871
but her only focus was Karen.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.872
So it's not just about maternal desire.
It's about a specific child.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.417
Karen was in the process
of becoming the kid's adoptive mom.

25:24.420 --> 25:27.116
The boy's name is Ben.
What if he's our UnSub's baby?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.418
Then he was probably
fostered by all of our victims.

25:29.420 --> 25:30.614
Do we know the birth parents' names?

25:30.620 --> 25:31.951
Sealed with the State.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.995
Time to unseal it.

25:35.250 --> 25:36.911
Julie,
what are you doing here?

25:37.330 --> 25:38.615
I missed you at lunch today.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.496
Yeah, I had band practice.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.115
You know, I was thinking about
taking up the flute.

25:42.710 --> 25:43.825
-Cool.
-Yeah.

25:44.620 --> 25:46.281
Maybe we could talk about this later.

25:46.290 --> 25:49.498
Oh, listen. Everyone's going
to this dance in a few weeks,

25:49.500 --> 25:53.914
and I was thinking maybe
you and I could go together?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.660
I'm not really into dances.

25:56.670 --> 25:58.456
But it'll be fun.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.577
Look, I know you haven't dated anyone
since the whole Ms. Hallman thing.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.748
ButI know I'm not
as old as her or experienced,

26:06.750 --> 26:08.536
but I know what to do.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.456
What's that?

26:11.460 --> 26:13.530
It was, I'm just watching TV.

26:13.540 --> 26:14.825
Was that a baby?

26:14.830 --> 26:16.457
No, no, it's not a baby. It...

26:19.830 --> 26:20.990
Ms. Hallman.

26:22.170 --> 26:23.410
I thought you were in jail.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.820
Let me give you a little lesson
on the prison system, sweetie.

26:25.830 --> 26:27.741
It's overcrowded, so I'm out.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.456
Yeah, well, you're not
supposed to be here.

26:30.460 --> 26:31.825
-You raped him.
-Julie!

26:32.420 --> 26:34.661
You think what we did was rape?

26:35.290 --> 26:36.746
We made love.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.167
Tell her, Tommy.

26:42.710 --> 26:44.325
It's true, Julie.

26:45.580 --> 26:46.740
This is my girl.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.320
Your mom has_a
restraining order against her.

26:49.330 --> 26:52.208
Lesson number two, Julie,
restraining orders can be broken.

26:55.420 --> 26:57.035
Take the baby to the car.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.371
Maggie, we...

26:58.380 --> 27:00.666
Tommy, take the baby to the car!

27:03.120 --> 27:04.667
Tommy, what are you doing?

27:08.170 --> 27:09.455
I'm calling the police.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.371
-Put the phone down.
-He's 16!

27:11.620 --> 27:12.871
So what?

27:21.880 --> 27:26.533
This is your final lesson, Julie.
Do not mess with the teacher.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.911
Okay, here's the dealio,
and stay with me.

27:50.880 --> 27:55.419
Ben, formerly known as Johnny,
was born to Margaret Hallman.

27:55.420 --> 27:56.660
Where is she now?

27:56.670 --> 28:00.379
Well, she should be at the Fallbrook
Women's Correctional Facility,

28:00.380 --> 28:04.282
but she was released four days ago
due to overcrowding.

28:04.290 --> 28:06.030
We thought it was a mental institution.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.577
But if she was released,
why kill to get your own kid?

28:08.580 --> 28:10.377
Her maternal rights
must have been terminated.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.109
Yeah. That happens when you have sex

28:12.120 --> 28:13.917
with one of your high school
students two years ago.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.320
His name is Thomas Brown,
aka Tommy Brown,

28:16.330 --> 28:18.070
and he is little Johnny's baby daddy,

28:18.080 --> 28:19.411
like, for real.

28:19.420 --> 28:20.660
Teacher love syndrome.

28:20.670 --> 28:22.877
She gave birth to Tommy's baby in jail,

28:22.880 --> 28:24.495
and then when Tommy's mom
refused to raise it,

28:24.500 --> 28:25.706
the baby was put in foster care.

28:25.710 --> 28:26.825
Okay, so we were right.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.707
The baby did spend time
in each of the victims' homes.

28:28.710 --> 28:29.916
You betcha.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.956
That would explain the spree
and the maternal desire.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.700
She's trying to put
her family back together.

28:33.710 --> 28:34.995
Garcia, we need the Browns' address.

28:38.790 --> 28:41.327
Maggie... What'd you do to her?

28:48.790 --> 28:49.950
I just scared her.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.109
You didn't shoot her?

29:00.670 --> 29:02.285
Maggie, she can't die.

29:02.290 --> 29:03.700
What if I died, Tommy?

29:04.170 --> 29:06.161
Do you know what
they did to me in jail?

29:06.540 --> 29:07.746
God...

29:07.750 --> 29:10.878
Ever since I met you, people have
been trying to keep us apart.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.411
The teachers at the school tried to.

29:21.580 --> 29:22.990
Did you hear...

29:29.750 --> 29:31.160
So did the students.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.576
Maggie, that's not the point.

29:36.580 --> 29:40.323
You know, in medieval times,
you could be 12 and get married.

29:47.580 --> 29:51.459
Henry VIII's first wife was
much older than he was.

29:56.540 --> 29:59.953
Romeo and Juliet were 13.

30:23.040 --> 30:26.612
Look, no one understands that
you and I were meant for each other.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.872
That time and age have no meaning.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.576
Now, you're the love of my life.

30:35.540 --> 30:37.371
But if I'm not yours, then get out.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.160
Get out!

30:51.710 --> 30:52.745
Drive.

31:25.580 --> 31:27.571
Please... Please help!

31:27.580 --> 31:28.786
Female down.

31:28.790 --> 31:31.281
We need an ambulance
at 1986 Homer Street.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.165
Is Margaret Hallman in the house?

31:33.620 --> 31:34.780
She took Tommy.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.031
Okay, you're gonna be okay.
What's your name?

31:37.040 --> 31:38.371
Julie Parker.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.529
Julie, do you know where they went?

31:39.830 --> 31:41.821
No. It hurts.

31:42.330 --> 31:43.570
Let's put this on it, okay?

31:43.880 --> 31:45.165
Are you Tommy's neighbor?

31:45.170 --> 31:48.207
Yes. Ms. Hallman
had their baby with her.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.871
Tommy took all his stuff.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.575
-The place is empty.
-It's clear here, too.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.957
We need to find out everything
we can about Margaret Hallman.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.325
There are probably
other victims in her past.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.109
Whose house is this?

32:06.120 --> 32:07.451
It's ours.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.949
Wow.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.490
This is awesome.

32:13.210 --> 32:15.826
You should see inside. It's beautiful.

32:18.210 --> 32:20.030
Maggie, I don't know what to say.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.166
I love you.

32:24.710 --> 32:28.202
I told you it wasn't over.
We're gonna do this, baby.

32:29.790 --> 32:32.418
Everyone said you were gonna forget
about me when you went to jail.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.706
No way. How could I?

32:34.710 --> 32:38.077
I wanted to show people the letters,
but I didn't want to get in trouble.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.162
That was very, very smart.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.740
You know, I was just
writing you this morning.

32:42.750 --> 32:45.537
Yeah? Well, you should read it to me.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.826
Why don't you go inside,
take a shower, and I'll freshen up.

32:47.830 --> 32:50.958
We have a lot of catching up to do.

32:58.580 --> 33:01.242
Ms. Hallman hac_l _ _
an exemplary record in jail.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.070
What was her correspondence
like with the outside world?

33:03.670 --> 33:05.240
Well, she had limited computer use,

33:05.250 --> 33:08.242
and she used all of that time
searching for a...

33:08.920 --> 33:10.410
Johnny Lewis.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.614
Her baby?

33:12.250 --> 33:13.410
No.

33:14.580 --> 33:17.322
Johnny Lewis is one of
her former students

33:17.330 --> 33:19.241
from Lake Forrest School.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.496
His parents charged her with
molestation,

33:21.500 --> 33:22.785
and then they dropped the charges.

33:22.790 --> 33:23.916
When was this?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.615
Three years prior to meeting Tommy.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.957
So she has a baby with Tommy,

33:27.960 --> 33:30.372
and names it after
the first kid she assaulted.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.245
Yeah. And according to
the prison's hard drive,

33:35.120 --> 33:36.872
Maybe Tommy's a surrogate for him.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.495
Garcia, we need to talk to the Lewises.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.741
Their phone is disconnected.

33:43.750 --> 33:44.956
What about an address?

33:44.960 --> 33:48.282
They've moved around a lot.
Wow, okay, it's like they're off the grid.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.872
Well, who lives in their old house now?
Maybe they can help us get info.

33:51.540 --> 33:56.785
It's changed hands a lot.
Snap, crackle and pop,

33:56.790 --> 33:58.451
goes the lady weasel.
You'll never guess who bought it.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.700
Ms. Hallman.

33:59.710 --> 34:01.280
Mmm-hmm. It was picked up
by her sister a year ago,

34:01.290 --> 34:03.497
and then it was transferred
to Maggie's name yesterday.

34:06.330 --> 34:10.118
Every day I think about
your touch, your smell...

34:12.380 --> 34:16.168
I wonder when we'll be back together
again, winter, summer, or fall?

34:16.960 --> 34:19.781
The metal bars that separate us
are just temporary, Maggie.

34:21.670 --> 34:24.821
Instead of keeping us apart,
they've made us closer.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.116
I didn't know life could be so good.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.951
You have the prettiest eyes.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.030
I think I'm gonna want
another kid, Tommy.

34:35.710 --> 34:37.450
Have a big family.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.780
Then we'll do that.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.378
I didn't know they tried to hurt you
while you were in there.

34:44.380 --> 34:45.950
Why didn't you tell me
about that in your letters?

34:46.210 --> 34:48.166
Well, I didn't want to scare you.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.319
I would have done something.

34:49.330 --> 34:50.957
Well, there's nothing
you could have done.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.166
All that's important
is that we're here now.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.956
What is it?

35:05.040 --> 35:06.200
It's the police.

35:06.210 --> 35:07.529
Did you call them?

35:07.540 --> 35:08.666
Why would I do that?

35:08.670 --> 35:09.910
Let me see your phone.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.615
I didn't call anyone.

35:12.290 --> 35:13.530
Maybe Julie did. I...

35:13.540 --> 35:15.076
If you're lying to me...

35:15.080 --> 35:17.708
I would never...
I would never lie to you.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.496
Yeah? Then...

35:20.000 --> 35:21.490
Then prove it.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.666
What do you want me to do?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.286
Protect your family, honey.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.916
Come here, sweet pea.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.241
Take the front.
Prentiss and I will take the back.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.739
FBI! Drop it!

35:58.750 --> 36:00.741
Just... Just move.

36:00.750 --> 36:01.876
Move, move back.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.609
Tommy, drop the gun.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.281
Just... Just get off our yard.

36:06.620 --> 36:08.247
You don't want to do this.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.878
You don't_ know_ me.
My girl and kid are in there.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.450
She's a predator, Tommy.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.781
No, she's not an animal.

36:16.710 --> 36:17.995
We love each other.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.911
No. No, Tommy, this isn't love.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.820
This is a woman who's been
taking advantage of you.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.161
She molested you.

36:23.170 --> 36:24.876
No, I knew what I was doing.

36:24.880 --> 36:29.533
Did you know that there was another kid
exactly like you from another school?

36:29.540 --> 36:30.746
Shut up!

36:30.750 --> 36:32.615
No, no! They're lying.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.747
Tommy,
she wrote letters to him, too.

36:34.750 --> 36:35.876
That's not true.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.029
And she'd tell him that

36:37.040 --> 36:38.780
-everything happens for a reason.
-Be quiet!

36:38.790 --> 36:40.872
She said that
he was the love of her life.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.279
That's it!

36:42.290 --> 36:44.531
That she loved
sneaking out to see him.

36:44.540 --> 36:47.202
I never thought I'd be
sneaking out to see you.

36:47.210 --> 36:48.450
You wrote that to me, Maggie.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.109
Tommy,
she wrote it to another boy.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.032
His name was Johnny Lewis,
and he lived in this exact house.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.874
I never thought I'd be putting
on fancy makeup just to see you smile.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.030
What are they talking about?

36:59.040 --> 37:01.452
She named
your kid after him.

37:01.830 --> 37:03.286
Is that true?

37:03.830 --> 37:05.115
I wasn't the only one.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.747
I still feel
the touch of your skin.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.378
-Answer me, damn it!

37:09.380 --> 37:14.500
Without you, my life would be empty.
Without you, I would go numb,

37:14.500 --> 37:16.912
and that's why nothing's
going to keep us apart,

37:16.920 --> 37:18.660
and I mean nothing.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.240
Maggie!

37:45.920 --> 37:47.410
We need paramedics
on the front porch.

37:47.420 --> 37:48.956
Maggie! Maggie!

37:50.080 --> 37:51.320
Maggie, stay with me.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.206
You were my light.

37:55.210 --> 37:56.780
Maggie, please don't go.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.917
You were my soul.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.031
I don't care what anybody says.

38:05.620 --> 38:07.076
I love you...

38:08.710 --> 38:10.701
I love you, Johnny Lewis.

38:25.710 --> 38:28.076
"For every good reason
there is to lie,

38:28.080 --> 38:29.911
"there is a better reason
to tell the truth."

38:30.710 --> 38:31.870
Bo Bennett.

38:32.670 --> 38:35.912
I will never understand
this whole teacher lover thing.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.320
I can barely deal with a grown man.

38:38.580 --> 38:41.743
What's interesting is, if it would
have been a male teacher

38:41.750 --> 38:44.162
and a female student,
he'd have gotten 20 years

38:44.170 --> 38:45.376
and none of this would have happened.

38:45.380 --> 38:48.417
Well, she could get life plus 20
for all those murders she committed.

38:48.420 --> 38:49.535
You know, it's funny.
If she wasn't so pretty,

38:49.540 --> 38:51.610
she probably would never have
been released in the first place.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.746
-What

38:52.750 --> 38:54.069
Unattractive female predators

38:54.080 --> 38:56.412
serve a longer prison sentence
than their attractive counterparts.

38:56.420 --> 38:57.739
Wow. That's ridiculous.

38:57.750 --> 39:00.708
It's primal. There's a hierarchy to
everything, including sex offenders.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.576
Okay, well, who's ready
to get breakfast?

39:04.210 --> 39:06.451
I can't.
There's something I gotta take care of.

39:06.460 --> 39:07.666
Okay.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.160
Hey, you.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.916
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.959
That's totally okay.
I have low-grade ESP,

39:18.960 --> 39:21.497
so I can pretty much
figure out what's going on.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.956
It works okay.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.827
Okay, I'll bite. What am I thinking?

39:25.830 --> 39:27.411
It's not what you're thinking.

39:27.420 --> 39:30.912
It's what Kevin and you
were talking about.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.319
I've been racking my brain

39:32.330 --> 39:34.116
over what it could be
for the last 48 hours.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.280
He's been sweaty,

39:35.290 --> 39:39.533
he's been reading my favorite books,
he's been getting my favorite foods.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.701
Derek, I hacked into his computer.

39:41.710 --> 39:42.825
Penelope...

39:42.830 --> 39:44.377
He's looking at rings.

39:45.290 --> 39:49.078
You know, the last time I checked,
Kevin is a pretty great guy.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.206
I knew it.

39:51.920 --> 39:52.955
-I knew it.
-Baby".

39:53.710 --> 39:55.166
This is a good thing, isn't it?

39:55.170 --> 39:57.070
Maybe to you it is, but not to me.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.453
What happened to your
standing Tuesday night date thing?

40:00.460 --> 40:02.496
That has nothing to do with this.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.822
When relationships get more official,
they get messy,

40:05.830 --> 40:09.322
and you give and you compromise,
and people change, and then...

40:10.040 --> 40:11.996
Somebody goes away,
and you're left empty.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.878
And I don't want that.
I don't... I don't want to be empty.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.326
Baby, I really don't think
that's going to happen.

40:17.330 --> 40:19.116
Yeah, that's what always happens.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.578
And, and I don't want any part of that.
I don't want any part of that at all.

40:27.170 --> 40:28.569
What's wrong, plum sauce?

40:29.120 --> 40:32.533
You know what? I'm gonna
let you guys do what you guys do.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.827
You... You know, don't you?

40:41.580 --> 40:42.660
Kevin...

40:43.330 --> 40:45.878
I like the way that things are now.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.826
I love how you have your space
and I have my space,

40:48.830 --> 40:52.994
and when we come together,
we're our own weird world

40:53.540 --> 40:54.996
unto ourselves, and...

40:56.040 --> 40:57.416
I don't want to ruin that.

40:57.420 --> 40:58.990
That's not what this would do.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.877
Yeah. It would.

41:05.080 --> 41:09.039
Penelope, are you,
are you against marriage,

41:09.620 --> 41:11.372
or are you just against marrying me?

41:11.380 --> 41:12.608
Kevin...

41:14.880 --> 41:16.495
I'm just not ready yet.

41:17.710 --> 41:18.779
Well, I am.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.240
Kevin.
