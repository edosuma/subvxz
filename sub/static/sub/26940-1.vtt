00:18.167 --> 00:21.133
Hi, I'm retired Navy SEAL,
Jason Redman,

00:21.135 --> 00:23.772
and I served in both Iraq
and Afghanistan.

00:24.339 --> 00:26.374
I've seen the true face
of terrorism.

00:26.775 --> 00:29.176
And in 2016,
when America experienced

00:29.178 --> 00:31.312
multiple domestic
terrorist attacks,

00:31.612 --> 00:34.480
my good friend and New York
firefighter, Tim Brown,

00:34.482 --> 00:36.818
came to me with a movie concept.

00:37.385 --> 00:40.123
Based around the idea,
what would happen

00:40.455 --> 00:43.157
if simultaneous terrorist
attacks occurred

00:43.159 --> 00:45.628
all across America,
all on one day.

00:46.262 --> 00:47.463
What would that look like?

00:48.162 --> 00:50.463
I didn't even like thinking
about the possibility of that

00:50.465 --> 00:52.768
and the bigger question
that came to my mind was,

00:53.436 --> 00:54.571
could we prevent it?

00:55.370 --> 00:56.638
Like Jason said,

00:56.971 --> 00:59.541
I sifted through the rubble
of the Oklahoma City bombing.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.575
I was under the towers
when they came down in New York,

01:02.577 --> 01:04.346
killing 93 of my friends.

01:04.679 --> 01:06.781
I've seen terrorism
up close and personal.

01:07.783 --> 01:09.683
So I thought what if
we banded together,

01:09.685 --> 01:13.622
not just to raise awareness
of terrorism in America,

01:14.122 --> 01:16.689
but to actually
help Americans understand

01:16.691 --> 01:18.391
how to prevent it,

01:18.393 --> 01:22.598
how to prevent this scourge
from visiting us, this evil

01:22.831 --> 01:25.267
of... from doing
what it did to me.

01:26.301 --> 01:27.534
And I didn't have to think twice

01:27.536 --> 01:29.437
about being involved
in this project.

01:29.637 --> 01:31.638
To raise awareness
for all Americans,

01:31.640 --> 01:34.242
to understand that this
a very real threat.

01:34.610 --> 01:35.911
And how they can prevent it.

01:36.479 --> 01:39.346
And Tim went about
recruiting 9/11 survivors

01:39.348 --> 01:40.814
to be involved in this film.

01:40.816 --> 01:43.883
And I... I went about looking
for fellow veterans

01:43.885 --> 01:46.589
and families of the fallen
from all wars,

01:46.822 --> 01:49.324
so that we could show you
how we can prevent

01:49.592 --> 01:51.293
a possible real story

01:51.760 --> 01:53.194
from ever happening.

01:54.363 --> 01:57.197
I hope when you watch this
you will spread the word

01:57.199 --> 01:59.299
to all your friends
and fellow Americans

01:59.301 --> 02:00.303
about this threat,

02:00.670 --> 02:01.837
but more than anything,

02:02.403 --> 02:04.173
I hope you'll walk away
from this

02:04.406 --> 02:06.875
being steadfast and vigilant.

02:35.536 --> 02:37.739
Clear.

02:42.212 --> 02:43.880
We're walking out
in the hallway!

02:45.714 --> 02:47.450
We're walking out
in the hallway!

02:53.488 --> 02:54.890
Move up. Regroup.

03:04.899 --> 03:06.902
Hey, jackpot, jackpot,
we got jackpot.

03:07.368 --> 03:09.570
We got it.

03:10.205 --> 03:11.741
- Right.
- Target secure!

03:12.675 --> 03:14.510
Aw, crap.

03:15.643 --> 03:16.778
And that's.

03:17.747 --> 03:18.848
Fatal mistake.

03:19.314 --> 03:21.015
Failure to properly
clear the target

03:21.249 --> 03:22.650
before calling target secure.

03:23.552 --> 03:26.022
Jot down and let's head back
to the classroom.

03:30.858 --> 03:32.962
Nobody dies like you do, Kamal.

03:34.863 --> 03:37.399
You guys always pick
on the brown people.

03:44.505 --> 03:45.640
All right guys...

03:46.541 --> 03:48.944
training's been going good,
really good.

03:49.612 --> 03:51.010
Maybe even too good

03:51.012 --> 03:52.781
for you guys to let
your guard down like that.

03:54.284 --> 03:55.751
Your time on target
has been great,

03:56.285 --> 03:57.954
your room entries
have been flawless.

03:58.588 --> 04:00.322
Right up until that last room.

04:00.689 --> 04:02.789
We set this scenario up
on purpose

04:02.791 --> 04:04.324
and you guys fell for it.

04:04.326 --> 04:05.892
You got sucked in
to the primary target

04:05.894 --> 04:07.296
in the center of the room

04:07.595 --> 04:09.364
and you missed the threat
in the corner.

04:09.731 --> 04:12.498
That fatal mistake
cost you the lives

04:12.500 --> 04:13.802
of two officers...

04:14.736 --> 04:15.938
and your hostages.

04:16.872 --> 04:19.639
Your primary objective
in this training exercise

04:19.641 --> 04:20.940
was the hostages.

04:20.942 --> 04:22.911
And in your
excitement to kill me,

04:23.612 --> 04:25.415
you neglected to get them
to safety.

04:25.814 --> 04:27.783
Your enemy is not as
well trained as you are.

04:28.384 --> 04:30.485
But do not ever
underestimate them.

04:30.852 --> 04:32.853
Their strength is in
the passion to an evil

04:32.855 --> 04:36.325
that they believe is not evil
but honorable.

04:36.725 --> 04:38.761
You have to understand that.

04:39.461 --> 04:42.064
And even though your training
is far superior than theirs...

04:43.398 --> 04:45.835
their heart and their passion
is much stronger.

04:47.302 --> 04:49.872
All right guys,
we train this way for a reason.

04:50.771 --> 04:52.974
The more we sweat and bleed

04:53.710 --> 04:55.678
in training scenarios
like this one,

04:56.412 --> 04:59.749
the less we bleed and die
in real world missions.

05:01.415 --> 05:02.483
Erin.

05:02.785 --> 05:04.654
All right guys,
let's head to the range.

05:33.715 --> 05:35.682
Hi, where do we check
our boat in?

05:35.684 --> 05:38.050
That's actually not necessary.
Welcome to the island.

05:38.052 --> 05:40.889
- Thank you.
- Welcome. Welcome.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.066
- Morning.
- Okay.

05:56.504 --> 05:57.973
- Good morning.
- Morning.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.013
What are you listening to?

06:39.146 --> 06:40.682
Not sure, probably nothing.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.722
A few months ago,
Anonymous attacked ISIS.

06:46.922 --> 06:48.822
A hacker friend of mine
sent this to me,

06:48.824 --> 06:50.693
they think it's from
a known ISIS leader.

06:51.526 --> 06:53.128
Sounds like Baghdad Airport
in the background.

06:55.131 --> 06:56.932
Why do you think
it's Baghdad Airport?

06:57.199 --> 06:59.235
I don't, Anonymous does.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.476
It's an airport,

07:08.944 --> 07:10.580
but not Baghdad Airport.

07:12.081 --> 07:14.550
More western modern airport...

07:16.184 --> 07:17.687
a busier airport.

07:19.888 --> 07:21.090
Maybe the Netherlands...

07:22.624 --> 07:24.893
Amsterdam or Berlin.

07:29.064 --> 07:30.199
Play it again.

07:32.468 --> 07:33.468
Listen.

07:33.802 --> 07:36.538
It goes from inside to outside,
boom...

07:36.771 --> 07:38.605
...he's on the street.

07:38.607 --> 07:40.542
Busy street with moving cars...

07:41.076 --> 07:43.713
...not parked cars like
they're waiting for arrivals.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.848
You barely hear him
over the traffic.

07:47.949 --> 07:50.151
Sound of the jet
in the background taking off.

07:52.487 --> 07:54.153
You know there's only
a few airports in the world

07:54.155 --> 07:55.824
that are in the middle
of the city like that.

07:56.792 --> 07:57.927
Keep working on it.

07:59.026 --> 08:00.128
Wait.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.698
There's a diesel engine
in the background.

08:05.033 --> 08:06.735
Can you isolate that and run it?

08:08.670 --> 08:09.872
Who else knows about this?

08:10.239 --> 08:11.741
No one, this is just a favor.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.173
My paper?

08:14.175 --> 08:15.610
I'm gonna hang on
to this.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.735
Gene says you got British
and Italian blood in you.

09:15.737 --> 09:17.971
Don't listen to that nitwit,

09:17.973 --> 09:19.375
he don't know
what he's talking about.

09:19.607 --> 09:21.740
Shh, can you turn
that up, please.

09:21.742 --> 09:23.710
<i>Detention center
after being picked up</i>

09:23.712 --> 09:26.712
<i>on suspicion
at Tampa International Airport</i>

09:26.714 --> 09:28.682
<i>for wanting to join
the terrorist group</i>

09:28.684 --> 09:29.885
<i>known as ISIS.</i>

09:30.285 --> 09:31.985
<i>A spokesman from the police say</i>

09:31.987 --> 09:34.389
<i>that two young females
were acting suspicious</i>

09:34.622 --> 09:37.892
<i>when trying to pay cash
for one-way tickets to Lebanon.</i>

09:38.593 --> 09:40.362
<i>During police questioning
it was revealed</i>

09:40.596 --> 09:41.794
<i>that they were attempting
to join</i>

09:41.796 --> 09:43.731
<i>the terrorist group, ISIS.</i>

09:44.131 --> 09:45.532
<i>We have, live on the scene,</i>

09:45.534 --> 09:46.832
<i>one of the fathers
of the young girls.</i>

09:46.834 --> 09:48.170
<i>Sir, how do you feel about this?</i>

09:48.370 --> 09:50.236
<i>My daughter didn't want
to be a terrorist.</i>

09:50.238 --> 09:51.605
<i>Give me a break.</i>

09:51.607 --> 09:52.806
<i>She's a naive kid
who got caught up</i>

09:52.808 --> 09:54.242
<i>in some stupid internet prank.</i>

09:54.910 --> 09:56.310
Did you hear the father?

09:56.811 --> 09:58.945
That happened here to his kids

09:58.947 --> 10:02.117
and the father thinks
it was a dumb internet prank?

10:02.349 --> 10:03.819
Internet prank?

10:04.285 --> 10:08.056
- That's propaganda, baloney.
- Are you trying to tell me...

10:08.891 --> 10:10.159
that two teenage girls...

10:11.293 --> 10:16.131
can get 3,000 dollars
to buy last minute tickets

10:16.330 --> 10:20.268
on a flight to Lebanon
to join some terrorist group?

10:21.136 --> 10:23.370
There's way too much
organization to this,

10:23.372 --> 10:25.171
there's a lot more to it

10:25.173 --> 10:27.075
than what appears
on the surface.

10:27.809 --> 10:29.177
What if they got boots
on the ground?

10:29.710 --> 10:30.876
Think they're here already?

10:30.878 --> 10:32.113
They're definitely here already.

10:32.713 --> 10:34.114
- That's it.
- Where you going?

10:34.116 --> 10:35.948
- I'm out of here.
- Where you going, sit down.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.719
I'm going on a recon mission.

10:38.152 --> 10:39.985
This has really been
an amazing experience,

10:39.987 --> 10:42.457
- Lieutenant Campbell.
- Hey, just call me Soup.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.693
Lieutenant,
that's a whole another life.

10:45.093 --> 10:47.328
So tell me
about your department.

10:48.163 --> 10:50.232
We have about 30 members
of the Pittsburgh SWAT.

10:51.232 --> 10:52.968
I'm very proud of my team.

10:53.868 --> 10:55.903
We mostly handle
crisis situations,

10:56.304 --> 10:58.239
hostages, gun related crimes.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.444
Well, I tell you
we really appreciate you guys

11:01.676 --> 11:03.745
bringing your team down here
to train with us.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.081
- Heathrow.
- What?

11:07.315 --> 11:09.484
Heathrow Airport, that's where
the phone call was made.

11:13.889 --> 11:15.091
The ISIS call.

11:19.694 --> 11:20.994
I pulled
all the engine noises out,

11:20.996 --> 11:22.294
including the diesel motor.

11:22.296 --> 11:23.497
Then, I could faintly
in the background

11:23.732 --> 11:25.065
hear a lady giving directions,

11:25.067 --> 11:26.902
"The second tube stop,"
she said.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.034
It's faint
but 100 percent accurate.

11:29.036 --> 11:32.173
And the diesel motor you heard,
matches engine types in the UK.

11:33.974 --> 11:35.343
Can you email me that file?

11:36.144 --> 11:37.146
Encrypted.

11:37.746 --> 11:38.780
You got it.

11:45.887 --> 11:46.954
Erin...

11:47.823 --> 11:50.159
I think it's about time
we give old Tex a call.

11:52.126 --> 11:53.161
Tex?

11:53.728 --> 11:58.230
Yeah, uh, he's a bull rider
turned security contractor.

11:58.232 --> 11:59.968
We worked with him in Iraq.

12:00.434 --> 12:01.535
Gosh.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.135
You do a lot of
contractor training here?

12:03.137 --> 12:04.838
Yeah. Lot of military,

12:05.073 --> 12:07.242
lot of law enforcement units,
like yourself.

12:08.077 --> 12:10.446
Then I'm grateful the city
of Pittsburgh sent us here.

12:12.447 --> 12:14.249
- Now what?
- Would you shut up?

12:14.482 --> 12:15.881
This is a waste of time.

12:15.883 --> 12:17.083
Here they come, here they come.

12:17.085 --> 12:18.951
Ah, you're a pain
in the neck.

12:18.953 --> 12:20.052
Oh, why don't you shut up?

12:20.054 --> 12:21.221
- I mean...
- You just talk

12:21.223 --> 12:22.288
- too much.
- You never stop.

12:22.290 --> 12:23.958
You just go on and on and on.

12:24.258 --> 12:25.960
Is that the church you go to?

12:26.261 --> 12:28.128
Yeah, but it's been
a long time.

12:28.130 --> 12:30.464
- I can tell that.
- What can you tell?

12:30.466 --> 12:32.898
You're looking
at a devout Catholic over here,

12:32.900 --> 12:34.303
I'll be Canaanite someday.

12:34.835 --> 12:36.168
Devout Catholic?

12:36.170 --> 12:38.070
When was the last time
you went to confession,

12:38.072 --> 12:39.538
let alone church.

12:39.540 --> 12:42.009
- Sixty-five years ago...
- Oh please, the same old thing

12:42.011 --> 12:43.110
- with you.
- Let me answer,

12:43.112 --> 12:44.411
- let me tell you.
- Stop it.

12:44.413 --> 12:45.912
Before I punch you
in the mouth, dang it.

12:45.914 --> 12:47.514
<i>Two pairs,
three and seven.</i>

12:47.516 --> 12:49.249
- <i>Gotta be kidding me.</i>
- <i>Ah.</i>

12:49.251 --> 12:51.283
<i>I can't believe you bet
with that amount again.</i>

12:52.353 --> 12:54.187
You always win, beginner's luck.

12:54.189 --> 12:56.188
Yes, uh,
how long you gonna keep saying

12:56.190 --> 12:57.856
it's beginner's luck, Soup?

12:57.858 --> 12:59.225
Soup here.

12:59.227 --> 13:01.029
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, can't complain, brother.

13:01.228 --> 13:02.530
Making it to the big time.

13:02.964 --> 13:05.232
Just completed our live
fire indoor kill house,

13:05.800 --> 13:07.135
only one on the east coast.

13:07.401 --> 13:09.037
Yeah man, you got
to get up here.

13:09.338 --> 13:11.106
You need to see it,
it's been too long.

13:13.107 --> 13:14.175
Hey listen,

13:14.809 --> 13:16.611
a friend of mine sent us
a recording of,

13:17.045 --> 13:19.515
what we believe is an
intercepted ISIS phone call.

13:20.415 --> 13:23.115
What's odd about it
is they talk about

13:23.117 --> 13:24.819
despite all they've
accomplished...

13:25.953 --> 13:27.890
we're still looking
for The Perfect Day.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.461
The call originated
from Heathrow.

13:33.027 --> 13:35.363
Three days ago, about
3:30 eastern standard time.

13:37.031 --> 13:38.434
What's The Perfect Day?

13:41.069 --> 13:45.973
In 1857, the Hindus and Muslims
in an attempt to

13:46.208 --> 13:49.310
overthrow the British government
in India,

13:49.944 --> 13:53.248
organized small simultaneous
attacks against the government.

13:54.214 --> 13:56.184
Thousands of small attacks, uh.

13:56.950 --> 13:59.988
Nanny killed the baby of whom
they were hired to look after...

14:01.488 --> 14:04.392
fires burned homes and shops of

14:05.126 --> 14:07.662
British citizens,
leaders were assassinated...

14:09.298 --> 14:12.134
all on one day, within several
hours of each other.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.237
They crippled the country.

14:15.870 --> 14:16.939
It was called...

14:18.106 --> 14:19.308
The Perfect Day.

14:25.113 --> 14:26.982
- Tex, you still there?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

14:27.549 --> 14:29.284
Hey man, if I send you
that recording,

14:29.984 --> 14:31.952
- can you run it for us?
- <i>Yup.</i>

14:32.420 --> 14:34.689
All right, thanks brother.
Hey, keep me in the loop.

14:47.368 --> 14:48.670
Thank you so much.

14:58.612 --> 15:00.648
I thought Denver would be colder
this time of year.

15:01.348 --> 15:02.650
Today is perfect,

15:03.251 --> 15:04.486
The perfect day.

15:14.362 --> 15:17.398
So I ran that registration
by the FBI.

15:18.132 --> 15:19.333
It came up as,

15:19.567 --> 15:23.272
Luis Marcel a software developer
from Lakeshore, Ontario.

15:24.039 --> 15:26.641
This guy comes here
'bout every other week.

15:27.309 --> 15:30.011
Stays for about three days
then leaves.

15:30.945 --> 15:32.546
I never see him
anywhere on the island,

15:33.015 --> 15:34.346
and he doesn't check
his boat in,

15:34.348 --> 15:36.150
so I can't search for him
in any database.

15:36.483 --> 15:38.052
He never checks his boat in?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.055
Here, it is not required
to check your boat in.

15:41.957 --> 15:43.288
And we don't have
the US Customs office

15:43.290 --> 15:44.492
on the island to monitor it.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.160
So you can...

15:46.428 --> 15:49.130
Yes, you can come
from Canada to the US...

15:49.697 --> 15:52.534
and never be stopped,
never show your passport,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.403
never see a customs agent,
nothing.

15:56.671 --> 15:58.437
You remember
that guy we met in Kosovo?

15:58.439 --> 15:59.708
Jackson Trembley.

16:00.308 --> 16:03.412
He was with Canadian Intel,
you should call him.

16:04.545 --> 16:06.515
I will. Hey, thanks.

16:07.248 --> 16:08.349
I'll stay in touch.

16:12.219 --> 16:15.156
Huh,
look what the cat drug in.

16:19.526 --> 16:22.062
- How you doing, brother?
- It's good to see you, slacker.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.064
Good to see you.

16:23.397 --> 16:26.367
And when politics are involved,
no one wins.

16:27.035 --> 16:28.536
- Ain't that the truth?
- Yeah.

16:29.337 --> 16:31.139
Thomas, this is Erin.

16:32.006 --> 16:33.675
Erin's my lead
sniper instructor.

16:34.074 --> 16:36.511
She's also the range safety
officer for today's training.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.647
Erin, this is Thomas Dearing.

16:39.079 --> 16:41.349
Thomas is the head of the Dallas
tactical SWAT team.

16:42.416 --> 16:43.783
We also go way back.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.586
Thomas and I went through
SEAL training together

16:46.087 --> 16:48.057
and I carried him
through sniper school.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.323
Shooter ready
on the right?

16:51.325 --> 16:52.491
Ready.

16:52.493 --> 16:53.628
Shooter ready
on the left?

16:54.695 --> 16:55.696
Ready.

16:56.164 --> 16:57.199
Stand by!

16:57.732 --> 17:00.265
Three, two, one!

17:46.681 --> 17:48.617
The kitchen and shelter
don't open 'til five.

17:49.149 --> 17:52.353
Oh, but I brought some food
I wanted to donate.

17:52.820 --> 17:53.856
Oh.

17:54.556 --> 17:55.691
Okay.

18:00.561 --> 18:02.561
I brought chicken,
mashed potatoes

18:02.563 --> 18:05.232
- and some green beans.
- Oh, that's nice.

18:05.666 --> 18:07.833
Um, I'm sorry,
what was your name?

18:07.835 --> 18:10.138
- John.
- John, I'm Allie.

18:10.338 --> 18:11.572
That's a beautiful name.

18:12.405 --> 18:13.840
- Thanks.
- So...

18:14.876 --> 18:17.311
would you mind if I hang around
during dinner?

18:18.578 --> 18:19.815
Maybe I can help.

18:21.415 --> 18:23.184
Yeah, I think that'd be nice.

18:23.585 --> 18:24.686
In here.

20:06.221 --> 20:07.356
<i>Hello?</i>

20:09.424 --> 20:10.626
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

20:11.926 --> 20:13.995
Carlene, it's Soup.

20:15.230 --> 20:16.798
I've got something
I've got to show you.

20:51.965 --> 20:53.434
Seat taken?

21:03.610 --> 21:04.812
Are you looking for a job?

21:07.481 --> 21:09.384
Um, my hotel...

21:10.751 --> 21:11.985
the internet is down and they...

21:12.319 --> 21:15.557
they said that I could use
this facility, is that okay?

21:16.825 --> 21:18.059
Yes, I'm sure it is.

21:21.361 --> 21:22.797
What kind of work do you do?

21:25.500 --> 21:28.670
Sales, um, I... I work,

21:29.470 --> 21:30.539
I travel.

21:31.772 --> 21:33.407
Do you like the job
you have now?

21:35.409 --> 21:36.644
I'm always looking.

21:40.681 --> 21:41.883
My name is John.

21:45.586 --> 21:46.788
Are you busy tomorrow?

21:47.722 --> 21:49.523
I have several job openings.

21:52.359 --> 21:53.361
No.

21:53.861 --> 21:54.995
I'm Dean.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.064
So how about I pick you up
tomorrow morning

21:58.066 --> 21:59.134
at the corner?

22:04.638 --> 22:06.540
I'm sure your hotel is close by,
and I...

22:06.741 --> 22:08.743
don't really know my way
around the city, so.

22:10.377 --> 22:11.579
On the corner, out front?

22:12.813 --> 22:15.516
Yes, I can, uh,

22:15.849 --> 22:18.753
I could check out
and walk to the corner say...

22:19.486 --> 22:20.554
7:00 a.m.?

22:21.923 --> 22:22.991
Yes.

23:06.734 --> 23:07.769
Paul.

23:09.736 --> 23:10.738
Paul.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.042
Why did this report
get to the director's office

23:18.044 --> 23:19.146
before mine?

23:20.815 --> 23:21.849
Um,

23:22.049 --> 23:24.051
because he needed
to know about it.

23:26.922 --> 23:29.857
Maybe at the CIA,
you don't have protocol.

23:30.925 --> 23:32.659
But here at the CTC,

23:33.059 --> 23:34.529
we have protocol.

23:35.163 --> 23:38.165
You report to me
and I report to the director.

23:39.634 --> 23:41.102
You answer to me, Carlene.

23:42.002 --> 23:43.537
You may be one of the best

23:44.004 --> 23:46.474
intelligence analysts
in Washington...

23:47.442 --> 23:48.543
and we're glad to have you...

23:49.610 --> 23:52.980
but your speculations
are without substance.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.983
You have chatter
about a trigger man

23:56.216 --> 23:58.018
recruiting from who knows where

23:58.552 --> 24:01.520
and a high ranking
terrorist making reference

24:01.522 --> 24:02.656
to The Perfect Day.

24:03.724 --> 24:06.224
This is called,
the Counterterrorism Center

24:06.226 --> 24:08.228
- for a reason, Paul.
- It's not credible.

24:08.463 --> 24:10.663
Listen to me, you have
no viable evidence

24:10.665 --> 24:12.163
of anything on large scale

24:12.165 --> 24:14.031
- to suggest...
- It's not large scale.

24:14.033 --> 24:15.569
That's the point.

24:16.070 --> 24:20.207
These are small attacks, Paul.
Small, but very real attacks.

24:23.043 --> 24:25.280
You know the story
of the girl who cried wolf?

24:27.915 --> 24:28.916
Is that a threat, Paul?

24:31.219 --> 24:32.220
No.

24:38.091 --> 24:39.159
Here's your protocol...

24:40.261 --> 24:42.230
don't ever touch me again.

24:47.701 --> 24:50.134
Echofar Bank has transferred
over six million dollars

24:50.136 --> 24:53.308
to multiple banks in Quebec
over the past several months.

24:54.242 --> 24:57.878
US Embassies are on high
alert all across the globe.

24:58.946 --> 25:01.782
Record number of Americans
are joining terrorist groups.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.785
Soup. Soup!

25:05.787 --> 25:08.690
The money, I know
it's being laundered here.

25:08.889 --> 25:10.224
Soup, what is going on?

25:11.791 --> 25:12.993
They're setting it up.

25:13.627 --> 25:15.297
They're setting up
for The Perfect Day.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.834
Unas Alibas.

25:21.234 --> 25:22.270
Known terrorist.

25:22.703 --> 25:26.708
We know he left Iraq
to join ISIS in Syria.

25:26.974 --> 25:28.943
We lost track of him
shortly after that

25:29.210 --> 25:30.612
and don't know where he went.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.015
All these guys...

25:34.882 --> 25:37.953
former Al-Qaeda,
new allegiance to ISIS.

25:38.851 --> 25:40.021
The problem is...

25:41.254 --> 25:42.889
nobody knows where they are.

25:44.058 --> 25:47.126
- Are they here?
- You should hope and pray not.

25:47.861 --> 25:49.763
Something's going on
here guys...

25:50.698 --> 25:52.866
- I know it.
- Let's get to work.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.337
What can we do?

25:55.903 --> 25:57.069
Research.

25:57.071 --> 25:58.804
Can you help us
investigate these leads?

25:58.806 --> 26:00.107
Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

26:00.607 --> 26:01.973
Thomas, this isn't any part

26:01.975 --> 26:03.376
of the Black Bear
Training Program.

26:03.844 --> 26:05.346
If you'd rather,
we have other instructors

26:05.579 --> 26:07.247
who can continue
your team's training.

26:07.682 --> 26:09.617
Are you kidding me?
This is for real.

26:10.317 --> 26:11.318
All right, then.

26:12.019 --> 26:13.989
Let's do this. Hey, Erik!

26:14.923 --> 26:16.391
You were let go, weren't you?

26:18.024 --> 26:19.259
How did you know that?

26:20.861 --> 26:22.896
You gave them ten years
of your life...

26:24.264 --> 26:26.300
it was where you made
a living for you...

26:27.635 --> 26:30.672
your wife, Sandra,
and your son, Connor.

26:32.606 --> 26:34.209
All was great, wasn't it, Dean?

26:36.644 --> 26:37.679
It was.

26:39.780 --> 26:40.982
They did me wrong.

26:41.781 --> 26:42.817
They did.

26:43.784 --> 26:44.918
And you know what...

26:45.854 --> 26:47.286
they've been doing
the same thing

26:47.288 --> 26:49.290
to countless other people
just like you.

26:50.124 --> 26:51.326
I lost my wife.

26:52.827 --> 26:55.163
We lost our house, our car.

26:56.731 --> 26:57.932
We lost everything.

26:59.767 --> 27:02.337
I know.
I know all about it and...

27:04.338 --> 27:05.674
I don't think it's right.

27:07.675 --> 27:08.876
No, it's not.

27:09.711 --> 27:13.711
Mr. Cochran, I represent
a large international network

27:13.713 --> 27:15.050
that is in the business of...

27:15.817 --> 27:17.184
reversing injustice.

27:18.886 --> 27:20.954
Providing fairness
to those wronged.

27:26.027 --> 27:27.859
How often do you wish
you could get back

27:27.861 --> 27:29.063
what you lost?

27:30.697 --> 27:31.732
Every day.

27:32.399 --> 27:33.400
Every...

27:34.202 --> 27:35.270
day.

27:36.369 --> 27:37.705
Your son, Connor?

27:41.040 --> 27:42.876
I haven't seen him
for three months.

27:45.378 --> 27:47.482
I have nothing.

27:49.983 --> 27:51.319
I lost so much.

27:53.221 --> 27:54.222
I know.

27:56.257 --> 27:58.993
But today,
we can turn that all around.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.730
How?

28:02.829 --> 28:03.831
Revenge.

28:04.831 --> 28:06.367
Justifiable revenge.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.405
Yeah...

28:11.271 --> 28:12.506
I want them to pay.

28:13.706 --> 28:15.075
Every last one of 'em.

28:17.144 --> 28:20.013
Mr. Cochran we want
to hire you for a job.

28:23.216 --> 28:24.284
Name it.

28:25.919 --> 28:27.187
Provide a revenge...

28:28.155 --> 28:30.758
to those in that building
that hurt you...

28:31.392 --> 28:33.995
and are hurting
so many other people.

28:42.435 --> 28:43.972
What do you want me to do?

28:45.873 --> 28:47.040
All right, listen up!

28:48.009 --> 28:49.076
Recently,

28:49.376 --> 28:52.010
we received reporting
that a top ISIS leader

28:52.012 --> 28:53.412
placed a phone call
that originated

28:53.414 --> 28:54.915
out of Heathrow Airport.

28:55.148 --> 28:58.152
That said, we're preparing
for The Perfect Day.

28:59.019 --> 29:00.488
Hundreds of small attacks...

29:01.288 --> 29:03.057
terrorist attacks originating...

29:03.924 --> 29:05.359
right here in the United States.

29:06.860 --> 29:09.997
Triggered by one event
and one person.

29:11.365 --> 29:15.904
Problem is we don't know
where, when, or how.

29:16.904 --> 29:18.338
That's what we need to find out.

29:19.373 --> 29:22.876
Dallas, I want you guys to focus
west of the Mississippi.

29:23.176 --> 29:25.478
Pittsburgh, you guys
got the east coast.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.579
We need data.

29:26.813 --> 29:29.449
Not political hype
or racial vilification.

29:29.916 --> 29:32.119
Work within your networks,
people that you know.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.454
And beyond.

29:33.887 --> 29:35.588
We need to know the pulse
of the law enforcement

29:35.822 --> 29:38.559
community out there.
FBI, homeland security.

29:38.992 --> 29:40.558
Do we need to call
anybody at the Bureau?

29:40.560 --> 29:43.030
Or the CIA?
Shouldn't we take this higher.

29:43.396 --> 29:44.930
We're way ahead of you.

29:44.932 --> 29:46.097
Guys, we don't
want anyone to know

29:46.099 --> 29:47.401
that we're investigating this.

29:48.101 --> 29:50.501
Okay, any word of this
could speed up plans

29:50.503 --> 29:51.905
to bring about The Perfect Day.

29:52.873 --> 29:55.242
And don't just target mosques
and Muslims.

29:55.876 --> 29:57.612
This is America's
biggest misconception.

29:57.845 --> 30:00.280
An Islamic extremist
is different than a Muslim.

30:01.415 --> 30:05.219
Okay, Dallas,
classroom 302 is open.

30:05.418 --> 30:08.088
Pittsburgh, I believe
204 is available.

30:08.388 --> 30:09.622
We're gonna keep
the conference room

30:09.857 --> 30:12.156
as headquarters.
I want everybody back here

30:12.158 --> 30:14.027
at the end of the day
with your reports.

30:14.261 --> 30:15.562
Seventeen hundred hours.

30:16.262 --> 30:17.365
Okay.

30:21.368 --> 30:23.303
- Okay, got it right here.
- That one.

30:34.616 --> 30:37.218
I appreciate what you said
about not targeting all Muslims.

30:39.252 --> 30:41.188
You Americans love
your stereotypes.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.460
You know him?

31:08.348 --> 31:10.182
And listen just take
those stairs over there,

31:10.184 --> 31:11.450
they are going to love you

31:11.452 --> 31:12.817
and you're going to have
a wonderful time.

31:12.819 --> 31:14.187
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much.

31:14.488 --> 31:15.556
Hi there, gentlemen, uh...

31:16.557 --> 31:18.625
Gene, Gene Whit.

31:19.326 --> 31:22.096
Oh my goodness, I haven't
seen you in forever.

31:22.663 --> 31:23.961
It's been a while.

31:23.963 --> 31:25.096
What on earth brings you
back here

31:25.098 --> 31:26.332
after all this time?

31:26.666 --> 31:28.703
Well, I figured old Mick here
could use a bit of church.

31:29.436 --> 31:31.571
Oh, hi Mick,
it's nice to meet you.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.675
Uh, we're looking to volunteer
for the youth group.

31:36.175 --> 31:37.576
That is fantastic.

31:37.578 --> 31:39.144
- Exact same thing...
- Can you direct us...

31:39.146 --> 31:41.512
Okay, so you're gonna
wanna take the elevator

31:41.514 --> 31:44.182
to the second floor,
not the third floor,

31:44.184 --> 31:45.383
'cause the third floor
is the nursery.

31:45.385 --> 31:46.652
Got it, thank you.

31:46.654 --> 31:47.653
But just take it
to the second floor...

31:47.655 --> 31:49.020
We're good, thank you so much.

31:49.022 --> 31:50.624
And when you get off
just hang a right.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.625
- You'll see it. Hi, how are you?
- Fine,

31:53.627 --> 31:55.093
- good morning, how are you?
- Good morning,

31:55.095 --> 31:56.731
it's good to see you here.
What can I do for you...

32:02.136 --> 32:08.709
<i>♪ Thousand stories of what
They think you're like ♪</i>

32:09.476 --> 32:14.280
<i>♪ And I hope to tell
The tender whisper ♪</i>

32:14.647 --> 32:16.082
You think she's here?

32:16.349 --> 32:18.418
I don't know Mickey,
we'll find out.

32:19.453 --> 32:24.288
<i>♪ And tell me that your reason ♪</i>

32:24.290 --> 32:27.025
<i>♪ To love wherever ♪</i>

32:27.027 --> 32:28.496
- Morning guys.
- Hey pastor.

32:29.097 --> 32:30.229
- Hey.
- Hey, uh,

32:30.231 --> 32:31.497
this is the youth department.

32:31.499 --> 32:32.700
Might you be looking
for the sanctuary?

32:33.134 --> 32:34.168
You calling me old?

32:34.702 --> 32:36.104
We're just visiting.

32:37.171 --> 32:39.171
Hey Andy, will you
come pray for us?

32:39.173 --> 32:40.675
Uh, excuse me,
I'll be right back.

32:55.155 --> 32:56.223
Can we sit here?

33:04.130 --> 33:05.265
What's your name, kid?

33:06.599 --> 33:07.601
Gabby.

33:10.703 --> 33:12.203
You in a war or something?

33:12.205 --> 33:13.241
I was.

33:14.207 --> 33:16.444
- Where?
- Korea.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.048
My dad was a soldier.

33:22.316 --> 33:25.553
There's nothing more noble
than to fight for a cause.

33:29.523 --> 33:32.092
Maybe we'll see
you later to... tonight.

33:39.466 --> 33:41.368
<i>Lark, what's up man?</i>

33:42.034 --> 33:43.236
Last night,

33:43.537 --> 33:46.505
you know the two guys
that travel with Luis Marcel?

33:46.507 --> 33:47.541
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:47.774 --> 33:49.607
Apparently, their job
is to take him

33:49.609 --> 33:51.779
to and from the island
twice a month.

33:52.546 --> 33:55.516
Get this, he doesn't
stay on the island.

33:55.817 --> 33:57.184
<i>What do you mean?</i>

33:57.585 --> 33:59.619
<i>As soon as he gets here,
he checks in</i>

34:00.153 --> 34:01.622
<i>and heads straight to his hotel,</i>

34:02.356 --> 34:05.292
seemingly spends hours there,
only he doesn't.

34:06.059 --> 34:07.358
They cover for him.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.828
They even order room service
to make it...

34:09.830 --> 34:11.398
to keep up the facade.

34:11.664 --> 34:14.264
<i>Instead, he takes
the public ferry to Ohio</i>

34:14.266 --> 34:15.699
<i>and returns a few days later.</i>

34:15.702 --> 34:17.668
Have you called our friend
at Canadian Intel yet?

34:17.670 --> 34:18.705
<i>No.</i>

34:19.237 --> 34:20.306
Hang on, buddy.

34:24.543 --> 34:26.344
Is Mr. Marcel still
on the island?

34:26.347 --> 34:27.714
<i>That's a negative.</i>

34:28.114 --> 34:29.514
Can you monitor the ferry boats?

34:29.516 --> 34:30.848
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Hello.</i>

34:30.850 --> 34:32.283
Jackson.

34:32.284 --> 34:33.417
<i>Lieutenant Campbell,
how are you friend?</i>

34:33.418 --> 34:34.853
Aw man, we're doing great.

34:35.321 --> 34:37.422
Hey, listen, we got something
we're working on here and...

34:37.757 --> 34:40.194
<i>You have my full support,
Soup, you know that.</i>

34:40.460 --> 34:42.196
<i>But can you tell me who else
is on the call?</i>

34:42.495 --> 34:43.664
Yeah, absolutely.

34:44.264 --> 34:46.734
You got Roy Williams,
Roy is the owner of Black Bear.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.801
On the speaker you got retired
lieutenant, Larkin Drake.

34:49.803 --> 34:50.838
Lieutenant Drake was the...

34:51.271 --> 34:53.139
<i>Guy who saved my butt in Kosovo.</i>

34:53.841 --> 34:55.877
<i>Lark, how you doing?
You still go by Lark.</i>

34:56.109 --> 34:57.143
<i>I do.</i>

34:57.377 --> 34:58.877
<i>Do you know
the software developer</i>

34:58.879 --> 35:00.781
<i>named Luis Marcel from Quebec?</i>

35:01.881 --> 35:03.716
<i>Gentlemen, I'm gonna need
a bit more.</i>

35:04.450 --> 35:06.283
This guy has been
making multiple trips

35:06.285 --> 35:07.819
under the radar into the US.

35:07.821 --> 35:09.891
Let me guess, by boat?

35:10.457 --> 35:11.559
- Lake Erie.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

35:12.126 --> 35:14.627
We don't have a lot
of intel to go on, but...

35:15.562 --> 35:18.263
something's going on here.
This may not be it.

35:18.265 --> 35:19.696
<i>Marcel is a carrier,</i>

35:19.698 --> 35:22.435
<i>the whole software developer
is a front.</i>

35:22.669 --> 35:24.604
<i>He was arrested on
money laundering charges</i>

35:24.838 --> 35:26.540
<i>a few years back.
We couldn't make it stick.</i>

35:26.740 --> 35:27.941
A carrier?

35:28.542 --> 35:30.277
<i>We know he's getting money.</i>

35:30.845 --> 35:32.913
<i>His accounts increase
with deposits</i>

35:33.146 --> 35:36.450
<i>and he pulls the cash
and he disappears on his boat.</i>

35:37.283 --> 35:39.417
<i>We figured it was a... a...
a business</i>

35:39.419 --> 35:42.356
<i>or maybe even a real,
bad gambling problem, but</i>

35:42.756 --> 35:45.660
<i>with recent events here
in Canada we...</i>

35:47.461 --> 35:49.463
<i>well maybe we should be taking
a closer look.</i>

35:49.763 --> 35:51.729
- Can you?
- <i>Yeah, I will.</i>

35:51.731 --> 35:53.400
<i>Is there anything else
you can tell me?</i>

35:54.301 --> 35:56.670
- No, not yet.
- <i>Okay,</i>

35:57.403 --> 35:58.938
<i>I got it. Let me see if uh,</i>

35:59.673 --> 36:02.309
<i>if we can track the money.
Give me a day or so.</i>

36:02.609 --> 36:04.345
Okay, thanks brother.

36:05.178 --> 36:06.280
Thanks, Lark.

36:10.850 --> 36:11.952
Roy,

36:12.352 --> 36:13.718
you know
we've always appreciated

36:13.720 --> 36:15.289
your financial assistance.

36:15.722 --> 36:17.424
Building this amazing facility.

36:18.292 --> 36:20.694
Your patriotism
to our great country.

36:20.894 --> 36:22.495
How much are you gonna need
this time?

36:23.196 --> 36:25.232
- I don't know yet.
- Let me know.

36:25.865 --> 36:26.934
Will do.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.456
Hey Gabby.

36:58.832 --> 36:59.900
Gabby?

37:00.767 --> 37:01.836
Are you smoking?

37:02.669 --> 37:03.971
No, I'm smoking.

37:04.838 --> 37:07.307
- Oh, hey guys.
- Hi.

37:07.606 --> 37:09.409
You know... you know,
we have handicapped parking.

37:09.676 --> 37:11.377
Do I look handicapped to you?

37:11.711 --> 37:12.812
Uh.

37:13.347 --> 37:14.712
Sorry we're getting here
a bit late.

37:14.714 --> 37:16.013
Oh you guys aren't late,
no worries,

37:16.015 --> 37:18.350
- the movie's about to start.
- Let's go on in.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.687
Great, great, we'll be right
behind you.

37:21.821 --> 37:23.657
I'm not gonna get you
in trouble.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.527
What military were you in?

37:27.760 --> 37:30.397
I was in the army rangers
second battalion.

37:33.265 --> 37:34.401
What was it like?

37:34.767 --> 37:36.000
What was it like?

37:36.002 --> 37:38.439
Oh, do you want a story?
All right.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.741
One time we came
to this village,

37:41.508 --> 37:45.678
outside the peninsula.
The bad guys basically,

37:46.046 --> 37:48.749
killed and burnt
the whole village down.

37:49.316 --> 37:51.551
But they knew
we would stop to help.

37:52.486 --> 37:54.688
They booby trapped everything.

37:55.655 --> 37:58.555
There was a woman laying
on the ground bleeding real bad.

37:58.557 --> 38:00.392
My friend O'Brian went to...

38:00.394 --> 38:02.495
went to her, boom,
the mine went off.

38:02.930 --> 38:06.430
I went to pick him up,
he was in pain, bad pain.

38:06.432 --> 38:08.401
He begged me not to move him.

38:08.901 --> 38:09.970
Uh,

38:10.370 --> 38:13.504
I looked in his eyes
and they were eyes of a man

38:13.506 --> 38:14.874
that knew he was going to die.

38:17.544 --> 38:19.979
- Did he?
- Yeah, he died in my arms.

38:22.783 --> 38:24.852
I guess that's the price
you pay in war.

38:25.785 --> 38:27.953
It's the price
I would pay over again

38:27.955 --> 38:30.591
to defend what is right.

38:30.957 --> 38:33.693
And... and the cost of freedom
is very high.

38:33.993 --> 38:35.528
And if we don't do it,

38:35.729 --> 38:37.897
thousands, even millions,
can die.

38:42.901 --> 38:45.371
This... what do you say,
do you want to go to that movie?

38:45.671 --> 38:46.673
Give me your hand.

38:49.843 --> 38:51.975
There's a memorial
I'd like to show you.

38:51.977 --> 38:53.414
To tell you about.

38:54.347 --> 38:57.117
Walked a steel down
from New York from 9/11.

39:30.450 --> 39:31.652
Hey, kid!

39:42.495 --> 39:43.694
Hey guys.

39:43.696 --> 39:45.598
- Hi, Gabby, how are you?
- Good.

39:46.033 --> 39:47.635
I'd like to show you something.

39:54.406 --> 39:55.609
What do you know about

39:56.142 --> 39:58.178
9/11, what happened that day?

40:00.046 --> 40:01.779
Not much, actually.

40:01.781 --> 40:04.182
I just learned about it
in school a little bit.

40:04.184 --> 40:05.218
Yeah.

40:05.618 --> 40:08.588
Did they tell you
anything about why,

40:09.055 --> 40:10.923
what happened, what caused it?

40:11.191 --> 40:12.225
No?

40:12.825 --> 40:13.894
Uh,

40:14.093 --> 40:15.961
kind of interesting um,

40:16.196 --> 40:18.129
my grandson
had the same reaction

40:18.131 --> 40:21.501
when I asked him
that same situation, um.

40:22.568 --> 40:25.238
You know about the two towers
that were hit?

40:26.439 --> 40:28.809
But did you know
that there were four planes?

40:29.475 --> 40:32.546
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, tower one, tower two.

40:33.046 --> 40:35.549
And then,
the Pentagon was struck,

40:36.048 --> 40:38.117
and then another plane went down

40:38.718 --> 40:40.787
in a town called Shanksville.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.255
And...

40:42.856 --> 40:46.126
that was where the term came,
it's time to roll.

40:47.093 --> 40:48.859
Do you recall hearing
that statement?

40:48.861 --> 40:49.829
No?

40:50.229 --> 40:51.263
Well...

40:52.097 --> 40:56.869
this is a dedication,
a tribute, to honor

40:57.738 --> 41:01.707
those more than 3,000 people
that were killed that day.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.678
Civilians, workers,
first responders,

41:04.977 --> 41:07.914
uh and subsequently since then,

41:08.515 --> 41:10.518
um, almost 7,000...

41:12.551 --> 41:14.787
military men and women
have been killed,

41:15.555 --> 41:16.623
in what is known

41:17.189 --> 41:20.660
as the War on Terrorism
since September 11th.

41:27.100 --> 41:28.935
I think I want to join
the military.

41:30.636 --> 41:31.905
I want to be a hero too.

41:32.506 --> 41:35.075
Why would you want to join
the US military?

41:35.542 --> 41:36.973
Because the military offers

41:36.975 --> 41:39.276
a tremendous amount
of opportunities for education.

41:39.278 --> 41:41.279
Last week you were joining ISIS,

41:41.281 --> 41:43.918
this week you joining
the US military?

41:45.852 --> 41:47.821
That...
that was an internet prank.

41:48.088 --> 41:50.624
A prank?
That's no prank young lady.

41:51.290 --> 41:52.758
I know it...

41:53.260 --> 41:55.995
- it was...
- It what, come on.

41:57.763 --> 41:58.932
It was just a game.

41:59.533 --> 42:00.601
A game?

42:01.533 --> 42:02.736
Bloody Warfare.

42:05.104 --> 42:07.675
It's a game my friends
and I used to play.

42:09.709 --> 42:11.044
A couple months ago...

42:12.745 --> 42:14.714
this player came on.

42:15.915 --> 42:18.651
And he just asked us
during the game...

42:19.318 --> 42:21.120
if we wanted to play
in real life.

42:21.988 --> 42:25.291
It's an online game
so you play with other people.

42:27.693 --> 42:28.761
Go on.

42:30.796 --> 42:32.263
He just asked us
during the game

42:32.265 --> 42:34.667
if we wanted
to play in real life...

42:35.334 --> 42:37.771
to become part of an army
in real life.

42:40.973 --> 42:43.008
He said if we flew to Syria...

42:44.010 --> 42:45.877
we could join the army
to help rescue

42:45.879 --> 42:47.014
women and children.

42:47.948 --> 42:50.117
We would fight
against the bad people there.

42:51.618 --> 42:53.153
He said we would do good.

42:55.354 --> 42:56.956
The player said he needed us.

42:57.323 --> 42:59.193
Gabby, who was this man?

43:00.292 --> 43:02.328
- I... I can't.
- Can't what?

43:04.698 --> 43:06.133
I can't say anything else.

43:17.977 --> 43:20.414
When we couldn't get overseas...

43:22.247 --> 43:23.751
he asked us if...

43:24.917 --> 43:26.086
if... if we...

43:28.254 --> 43:29.790
he sent us money.

43:32.859 --> 43:35.795
He wanted us to make bombs
to take to school but...

43:36.296 --> 43:38.332
that's when I said no,
I got out.

43:39.231 --> 43:40.666
He said he would kill us.

43:41.234 --> 43:44.037
Nobody's gonna hurt you,
doll face, nobody.

43:45.339 --> 43:47.340
Gabby, who was this man?

43:48.107 --> 43:50.207
I don't know,
he just messaged us

43:50.209 --> 43:51.743
through the game,
but I don't play anymore,

43:51.745 --> 43:52.813
I swear.

43:54.013 --> 43:55.415
Gabby, let's go for a walk.

44:01.053 --> 44:02.319
What?

44:02.321 --> 44:03.423
She's talking about bombing
a school.

44:03.656 --> 44:04.723
What is she, crazy?

44:04.925 --> 44:06.857
We need to call the FBI
and the police.

44:06.859 --> 44:08.392
Hold on, this is serious,

44:08.394 --> 44:10.396
we got to think about this,
this is bigger than Gabby.

44:15.401 --> 44:16.703
Hey, Mickey.

44:17.271 --> 44:19.039
Yeah, hello, doll face,
how are ya?

44:19.339 --> 44:22.138
- I'm good.
- You know, I never asked you,

44:22.140 --> 44:24.912
but I have an idea you work
for the government.

44:27.113 --> 44:28.248
What's going on?

44:53.173 --> 44:54.506
Did you get everything
loaded okay?

44:55.809 --> 44:59.812
One hundred 25-pound bags
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.949
That will be 756 dollars.

45:28.107 --> 45:29.506
I've got friends telling me

45:29.508 --> 45:31.441
extremists are infiltrating
the armed forces.

45:31.443 --> 45:32.877
The government's
never gonna fall

45:32.879 --> 45:34.147
to political correctness.

45:34.347 --> 45:36.314
Seasoned guys are never gonna
allow what happened

45:36.316 --> 45:37.885
at Fort Hood to happen again.

45:38.385 --> 45:39.584
What else?

45:39.586 --> 45:40.821
You're right
about one thing, Soup.

45:44.890 --> 45:46.225
Um...

45:46.825 --> 45:51.062
Usually between Interpol,
CIA, NSA, FBI,

45:51.064 --> 45:54.165
we get about 200 to 300 hits
on terrorism

45:54.167 --> 45:55.969
- or extremist chatter a day.
- What kind of hits?

45:56.202 --> 45:58.571
An email,
intercepted phone call,

45:59.004 --> 46:01.307
um, maybe even
an encrypted recording.

46:01.540 --> 46:02.874
In the past few weeks,

46:02.876 --> 46:04.810
that number has risen
over a 1,000.

46:05.010 --> 46:06.213
Before 9/11,

46:06.446 --> 46:08.582
chatter concerning an attack
was all over the place.

46:09.216 --> 46:11.417
Thousands of pieces
of information.

46:12.084 --> 46:13.519
Everyone knew something
was gonna happen.

46:14.386 --> 46:16.356
That was the problem,
everyone knew something,

46:16.957 --> 46:19.326
but nobody worked collectively
to put it all together.

46:20.526 --> 46:23.428
My brother is with the FBI
in South Carolina.

46:23.430 --> 46:26.366
I called him just to check on
what he's been hearing.

46:26.966 --> 46:28.299
He began to tell me
about a group

46:28.301 --> 46:29.899
called the Underground Foocruft.

46:29.901 --> 46:31.003
I've heard of 'em.

46:33.339 --> 46:36.009
They've been around
for some 30 odd years.

46:36.343 --> 46:39.042
Small communities,
mostly in rural places,

46:39.044 --> 46:41.145
um, most Muslim.
They live together,

46:41.147 --> 46:43.247
they have their own sets
of laws.

46:43.249 --> 46:46.084
Years ago, they were connected
with acts of violence,

46:46.086 --> 46:48.285
assassinations,
stockpiling weapons.

46:48.287 --> 46:50.222
- How many are there?
- Twenty...

46:50.990 --> 46:53.560
maybe 30, scattered
across the United States.

46:54.394 --> 46:56.993
My brother said if there's an
infrastructure for terrorism

46:56.995 --> 46:59.932
in the United States,
this group already has it.

47:01.501 --> 47:02.602
That's a map
of where they're located.

47:04.169 --> 47:05.204
Brian.

47:06.372 --> 47:09.307
In every tactical operation,
there's a start point.

47:10.042 --> 47:12.375
How do they communicate
with each individual player

47:12.377 --> 47:13.479
to say, "Hey...

47:14.881 --> 47:16.283
attack, it's time".

47:17.182 --> 47:18.550
There has to be a trigger.

47:19.452 --> 47:21.921
We find the trigger,
we stop the attack.

47:24.124 --> 47:26.325
How do we find a trigger
that no one wants us to find?

47:27.060 --> 47:28.526
They would never trust
a strategy

47:28.528 --> 47:29.930
to just messages alone...

47:31.131 --> 47:32.531
it could get distorted.

47:39.138 --> 47:40.372
It's an event.

47:41.106 --> 47:43.275
It's an event that they control.

47:44.343 --> 47:46.512
And if we're not careful
with our investigation,

47:47.080 --> 47:48.248
we could speed it up.

47:49.048 --> 47:50.484
Okay guys, listen up.

47:51.218 --> 47:53.353
That was a buddy of mine,
police officer.

47:54.354 --> 47:56.053
He said a concerned citizen
called today

47:56.055 --> 47:58.959
to report a guy buying
2,500 pounds of fertilizer.

47:59.258 --> 48:00.558
- Ammonia nitrate?
- Yes.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.426
They have a person
and vehicle description,

48:02.428 --> 48:04.097
but haven't been able
to track him down.

48:07.367 --> 48:09.667
Hey guys, let's take
a break for dinner

48:09.669 --> 48:11.203
and meet back here in...

48:12.104 --> 48:13.205
uh, say, an hour?

48:14.307 --> 48:15.408
Okay, thanks.

48:16.176 --> 48:18.178
Thomas, hang on a minute.

48:24.350 --> 48:25.518
What's up, Soup?

48:26.385 --> 48:28.019
Brother, you guys are here
for training.

48:28.021 --> 48:29.022
No worries, we're good.

48:31.390 --> 48:33.693
Terrorist camps,
ammonium nitrate,

48:34.361 --> 48:36.263
questionable northern
border security.

48:38.196 --> 48:39.465
What I'm about to ask you...

48:41.401 --> 48:43.036
you got to be straight up
with me.

48:45.405 --> 48:48.006
We need guys monitoring
this Underground Foocruft.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.409
Luis Marcel at the resort,

48:51.077 --> 48:52.145
where he's going...

48:53.146 --> 48:55.414
I need your guy in Ohio
to get us more info.

48:57.149 --> 48:58.452
There's a pattern here.

48:59.352 --> 49:00.484
And we're not gonna solve it

49:00.486 --> 49:02.356
by sitting
in this conference room.

49:05.524 --> 49:08.595
What I'm asking you could cost
you your jobs...

49:10.396 --> 49:11.598
maybe more.

49:12.365 --> 49:16.502
But I can't sit by
and allow 9/11 to happen again.

49:18.305 --> 49:19.736
We've got to do something to...

49:19.738 --> 49:21.507
- Protect America.
- Exactly.

49:23.042 --> 49:24.676
- You gonna ask him?
- No need to,

49:25.077 --> 49:26.545
this is what we're trained
to do.

49:31.318 --> 49:33.453
- I'll let Erik know.
- Thanks, brother.

49:41.060 --> 49:44.063
- Carlene, I'm glad you...
- Soup, I'm gonna be blunt.

49:44.629 --> 49:47.032
Officially I'm required
to tell you to cease and desist.

49:47.232 --> 49:48.600
What, why?

49:48.602 --> 49:50.270
Because the threat
isn't considered credible.

49:51.470 --> 49:52.903
<i>It wasn't my call.</i>

49:52.905 --> 49:54.508
Personally, I think
you're on to something but,

49:54.774 --> 49:56.607
I'm glad at least someone
is remaining vigilant

49:56.609 --> 49:58.274
during an era
of political correctness

49:58.276 --> 50:00.213
and bruised egos.

50:02.048 --> 50:03.247
I have to run.

50:03.249 --> 50:05.216
But don't stop
what you're doing,

50:05.218 --> 50:06.386
and as a favor to me,

50:07.053 --> 50:07.754
be discreet.

50:08.354 --> 50:11.257
Oh, don't worry,
I'm always discreet.

50:21.533 --> 50:24.570
Erin, I'm gonna need you
to set up a deployment schedule.

50:25.305 --> 50:28.341
Alex, I need secure comps
for both teams.

50:28.707 --> 50:30.573
Have 'em go to dinner
and meet back in here

50:30.575 --> 50:32.109
for the warning order.

50:32.111 --> 50:33.743
Roy's deposited the funds
in the account

50:33.745 --> 50:35.145
for the operation.

50:35.147 --> 50:37.113
I want troops
in the field tonight.

50:37.115 --> 50:38.184
Yes, sir.

50:45.258 --> 50:47.326
Kamal, you're coming with me.

50:48.260 --> 50:50.128
- Where are we going?
- To a party.

50:50.763 --> 50:53.133
- Wear a suit.
- Seriously?

50:59.138 --> 51:01.207
- Are you Mr. Whit?
- I am.

51:01.607 --> 51:04.341
- Carlene sent me.
- You called Carlene?

51:04.343 --> 51:06.780
- What do you want from me?
- And you must be Gabby.

51:07.747 --> 51:09.281
Yes. Yes, sir.

51:10.383 --> 51:12.149
I'm gonna need to speak
with Gabby alone.

51:12.151 --> 51:14.484
No, the girl's gonna stay
with us.

51:14.486 --> 51:16.423
- Yeah.
- Okay.

51:18.191 --> 51:20.861
Gabby, I'm Wayne Schaffer,
I work with Mr. Whit's daughter.

51:22.127 --> 51:23.896
I need you to tell me everything

51:24.129 --> 51:25.495
that you discussed
with those gentlemen,

51:25.497 --> 51:26.732
and in great detail.

51:27.700 --> 51:29.434
And then I'm gonna ask you
to do something

51:29.734 --> 51:31.303
that's gonna take
a lot of courage.

51:31.504 --> 51:32.572
What?

51:33.705 --> 51:35.374
I need you to take
this flash drive

51:35.774 --> 51:38.577
and put it in the USB port
in all your friend's computers.

51:39.412 --> 51:40.881
But you got to do it
without them knowing.

51:42.182 --> 51:43.450
You gonna be able to do this?

51:44.716 --> 51:45.919
Yes.

51:46.519 --> 51:47.754
All right, good.

51:54.392 --> 51:55.896
Well let's take it
from the top here.

51:57.463 --> 51:58.531
I think it's...

51:59.397 --> 52:00.466
very awesome

52:00.700 --> 52:02.433
those guys would risk
their careers

52:02.435 --> 52:03.734
maybe even their lives

52:03.736 --> 52:06.239
to follow the threat
and try to stop it.

52:06.705 --> 52:07.807
It is.

52:09.207 --> 52:10.343
You would know.

52:11.877 --> 52:13.778
So are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

52:13.780 --> 52:15.582
So you gonna tell me
what's going on?

52:20.352 --> 52:22.556
The missing Al-Qaeda leaders
that disappeared...

52:24.222 --> 52:25.357
they didn't disappear.

52:26.225 --> 52:27.327
I know.

52:28.227 --> 52:29.662
I know they didn't disappear.

52:32.164 --> 52:33.532
They're not with other groups.

52:35.334 --> 52:37.267
They're being held
by United States.

52:37.269 --> 52:38.404
What?

52:38.703 --> 52:41.538
After Osama Bin Laden's death,
your CIA partnered

52:41.540 --> 52:43.741
with the Iraqi government
to secretly capture

52:43.743 --> 52:45.712
the last remaining commanders
of Al-Qaeda.

52:46.444 --> 52:47.546
It was a trick.

52:48.714 --> 52:51.883
The Iraqis promised
them protection, they didn't.

52:52.517 --> 52:54.320
They turned them over
to the CIA.

52:56.656 --> 52:58.792
- That makes no sense.
- Think about it.

53:00.225 --> 53:01.424
The Americans had just killed

53:01.426 --> 53:03.262
the most wanted man
in the world.

53:04.430 --> 53:07.765
His men needed protection.
One by one they came in secrecy

53:07.767 --> 53:11.203
and one by one they were
turned over to the Americans.

53:11.970 --> 53:13.439
- Gitmo?
- No.

53:14.473 --> 53:15.508
No.

53:15.742 --> 53:18.343
A separate prison inside
the United States.

53:18.778 --> 53:21.444
No way, they could never keep
that a secret.

53:21.446 --> 53:22.515
They did.

53:22.781 --> 53:24.283
How do you know this?

53:25.417 --> 53:27.486
One of the men,
Muhammad Jiran...

53:28.354 --> 53:29.489
is my brother.

53:29.955 --> 53:33.359
He was a double agent.
He was offered this deal.

53:34.593 --> 53:36.426
My father told him not to go,

53:36.428 --> 53:38.597
and like he feared,
Muhammad never came home.

53:40.499 --> 53:42.633
Iraqi regime, of course,
denies turning

53:42.635 --> 53:45.504
any of these men over
but it happened.

53:51.377 --> 53:53.678
How'd your brother get arrested
if he was a double agent?

53:54.513 --> 53:55.946
Because he's still
gathering intel

53:55.948 --> 53:57.650
from the prisoners
being brought in.

53:58.718 --> 54:00.886
These men talk in prison
and my brother listens.

54:04.289 --> 54:07.425
If you want to find out
anything global terrorism,

54:07.959 --> 54:12.363
The Perfect Day, trigger,
the infrastructure,

54:12.365 --> 54:15.334
strategy of an attack,
I need to talk to him.

54:20.339 --> 54:22.542
Kamal, I'm gonna need you
to stay in the truck.

54:24.977 --> 54:26.843
I got all dressed up
and rode here

54:26.845 --> 54:28.514
for you to leave me in the car?

54:30.615 --> 54:32.551
This isn't the right place
for you to be seen...

54:33.484 --> 54:34.620
at least not yet.

54:35.488 --> 54:37.557
Don't worry,
I'll bring you something.

55:16.528 --> 55:17.763
What are you doing here?

55:18.930 --> 55:21.400
What about this is discreet?

55:22.368 --> 55:23.536
Don't worry,

55:24.035 --> 55:25.137
you can trust me.

55:29.008 --> 55:31.511
So you, um, come alone?

55:33.078 --> 55:34.147
Kind of.

55:37.515 --> 55:38.885
- Hello.
- Hi.

55:39.084 --> 55:41.153
I'm sorry, son, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

55:42.955 --> 55:45.790
No one invited you, Soup,
it was a gesture of good will.

55:46.091 --> 55:47.823
I didn't actually think
you would come.

55:47.825 --> 55:48.994
Yet, here I am.

55:50.129 --> 55:52.031
But you are late,
that's strike one.

55:54.466 --> 55:56.102
- Ladies.
- Thank you.

55:56.669 --> 55:58.737
- You should try one.
- I'm good.

55:59.370 --> 56:02.541
My wife made those personally,
lieutenant.

56:02.774 --> 56:05.577
- That's strike two.
- Sir, can I have a moment?

56:07.713 --> 56:08.714
Sure.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.756
What do you know
about The Perfect Day?

56:19.591 --> 56:21.491
What do you know
about the secret prison

56:21.493 --> 56:23.830
that's holding top level
Al-Qaeda operatives...

56:24.629 --> 56:26.098
right here in the United States?

56:28.600 --> 56:29.767
And that's strike three.

56:30.502 --> 56:31.838
Good to see you again, Campbell.

56:51.022 --> 56:52.524
Went that well, yeah?

56:58.196 --> 56:59.631
Do you trust me, Kamal?

57:00.798 --> 57:02.634
You're the only one I do trust.

58:25.917 --> 58:27.252
Everyone's in the field, sir.

58:31.156 --> 58:33.326
- Expecting someone?
- Yup.

58:34.827 --> 58:35.995
Any minute now.

58:48.073 --> 58:49.576
I need to talk to you.

58:56.582 --> 58:57.783
Last night,

58:57.982 --> 58:59.718
what were you talking about
with the admiral?

59:01.821 --> 59:03.056
Have you lost your mind?

59:03.722 --> 59:04.856
What are you doing?

59:06.825 --> 59:08.292
You have a known
international terrorist

59:08.294 --> 59:10.227
saying things like
The Perfect Day

59:10.229 --> 59:12.832
on a phone call traced back
to Heathrow Airport.

59:13.265 --> 59:14.765
You have increased
chatter of threats.

59:15.566 --> 59:18.870
You have a secret prison
harboring terrorists illegally.

59:19.305 --> 59:20.738
You have a suspected terrorist

59:20.740 --> 59:22.774
making multiple trips
into the US

59:23.042 --> 59:24.877
under the radar through Canada

59:25.176 --> 59:26.745
carrying large amounts of cash.

59:27.044 --> 59:29.648
Small operatives are preparing
for something big.

59:30.249 --> 59:33.917
Just yesterday, an Arabic man
was spotted in eastern Ohio

59:33.919 --> 59:37.390
buying 2,500 pounds
of ammonium nitrate.

59:39.892 --> 59:41.758
We're running
our own investigation.

59:41.760 --> 59:42.994
Listen Paul,

59:43.328 --> 59:45.131
if they find out
we're on to them,

59:45.865 --> 59:46.966
it's over.

59:47.732 --> 59:48.868
You have any men on this?

59:49.334 --> 59:52.070
- Possibly.
- Who, where?

59:52.870 --> 59:53.872
I can't tell you that.

59:55.307 --> 59:57.377
Something's going to happen

59:57.776 --> 01:00:00.111
and I think it's going to happen
really soon.

01:00:00.745 --> 01:00:02.245
We believe an event
is going to trigger

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:03.816
simultaneous attacks.

01:00:04.917 --> 01:00:07.252
- What kind of event?
- Something big,

01:00:07.852 --> 01:00:10.289
and I think I've got an idea
to find out.

01:00:11.622 --> 01:00:14.957
We need to get someone
inside that secret prison.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:15.961
What?

01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:18.430
First, nothing like that exists.

01:00:18.664 --> 01:00:20.230
And second,
even if it did exist,

01:00:20.232 --> 01:00:22.100
- how would you get someone...
- Kamal.

01:00:23.068 --> 01:00:25.370
- Who?
- Adetra Jiran,

01:00:26.004 --> 01:00:27.306
the man outside.

01:00:28.073 --> 01:00:31.008
He was a paid interpreter
for the SEAL teams back in Iraq.

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:33.445
Turns out, he knew a lot.

01:00:34.981 --> 01:00:37.850
His family had strong ties
back to Al-Qaeda.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.186
He risked his life
and his family

01:00:40.385 --> 01:00:42.187
to provide us
crucial information.

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:44.156
After the war,

01:00:44.722 --> 01:00:45.891
US abandoned him.

01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:49.162
Tied up his Visa application
in tons of red tape.

01:00:49.995 --> 01:00:51.263
I got him here.

01:00:51.897 --> 01:00:52.998
Got him a new name

01:00:53.732 --> 01:00:56.301
and a new life.
He now works for us.

01:01:00.039 --> 01:01:01.073
And?

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.308
His family thinks he's dead.

01:01:03.742 --> 01:01:06.446
His cover as an interpreter
was never compromised.

01:01:08.013 --> 01:01:10.283
That man is his brother.

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:14.153
Paul, you know as well as I do,

01:01:14.854 --> 01:01:17.056
if something big really
is going to happen,

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.058
those men would know about it.

01:01:19.357 --> 01:01:21.160
Even from inside that prison...

01:01:21.993 --> 01:01:23.396
they would know the strategy.

01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:26.866
So what's your plan?

01:02:11.843 --> 01:02:14.213
- Well, did he agree?
- He's checking on it.

01:02:18.084 --> 01:02:20.486
Boss, boss you have to see this
to believe it.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.955
These fliers
are popping up everywhere.

01:02:24.356 --> 01:02:26.990
"Join the fight
against the west.

01:02:26.992 --> 01:02:28.461
Materialism
will leave you empty.

01:02:29.095 --> 01:02:31.093
False prophets are
destroying America,

01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:32.530
join us on Facebook."

01:02:33.198 --> 01:02:35.265
- Are you kidding me?
- It was on a community

01:02:35.267 --> 01:02:37.035
bulletin board at an airport
in Minneapolis.

01:02:37.236 --> 01:02:39.035
One of operatives
snapped a picture of it.

01:02:39.037 --> 01:02:40.906
I love this country but the fu...

01:02:42.207 --> 01:02:44.240
We have fought
and are still fighting,

01:02:44.242 --> 01:02:45.843
even dying,

01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.444
so that other people out there
can express their rights

01:02:48.446 --> 01:02:50.279
through garbage like that.

01:02:50.281 --> 01:02:51.883
When is enough gonna be enough?

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:55.019
If you don't like our country,
if you don't like our culture,

01:02:55.421 --> 01:02:59.392
if you don't like our freedoms,
there's the door, use it!

01:03:00.892 --> 01:03:02.894
Not you Paul, come on in.

01:03:03.495 --> 01:03:05.462
Chairman Burns is good
with your proposal.

01:03:05.464 --> 01:03:06.898
Under two conditions.

01:03:07.298 --> 01:03:08.899
I oversee the operation

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.868
and one of our guys
comes down here

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.438
to get familiar with whatever
it is you're doing here.

01:03:14.506 --> 01:03:16.208
He'll report his findings
back to us...

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:19.845
and I will make the decisions
on how to proceed.

01:03:21.013 --> 01:03:23.615
No offense Paul,
I'm good with all of it,

01:03:24.182 --> 01:03:25.515
but if you're gonna
have someone down here

01:03:25.517 --> 01:03:28.053
spying on us,
we get to pick the agent.

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:33.055
- Who?
- Agent Whit.

01:03:33.057 --> 01:03:34.860
- No.
- No deal.

01:03:38.964 --> 01:03:40.098
Okay, Campbell.

01:03:40.598 --> 01:03:43.165
I will have Agent Whit
report here tomorrow,

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:46.271
but let me be clear,
I want to know everything.

01:03:47.305 --> 01:03:49.407
Agent Whit's already
on my short list.

01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:52.375
So if I don't get everything...

01:03:52.377 --> 01:03:53.578
It's all good buddy,

01:03:54.245 --> 01:03:56.281
we're all on the same team,
right?

01:03:58.550 --> 01:03:59.986
Have your guy...

01:04:00.519 --> 01:04:01.988
drive his car...

01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.289
to this address.

01:04:05.323 --> 01:04:06.723
We'll take care of the rest.

01:04:06.725 --> 01:04:09.528
Do I need to bring a bomb
or will one be provided?

01:04:10.995 --> 01:04:12.231
Just show up.

01:04:21.406 --> 01:04:23.910
She's the best intel operative
they have.

01:04:24.876 --> 01:04:25.912
Fine, all right.

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.580
At this point, I don't care.

01:04:30.548 --> 01:04:32.984
How sure are we
of the Canadian IP address?

01:04:35.888 --> 01:04:37.356
Go ahead
and do the instillation.

01:04:38.055 --> 01:04:39.090
Um...

01:04:39.591 --> 01:04:41.260
Basic service I guess for now.

01:04:42.026 --> 01:04:43.396
Um, just set it up...

01:04:44.328 --> 01:04:45.497
but make it soon.

01:04:47.399 --> 01:04:48.434
Cable guy.

01:04:50.234 --> 01:04:51.435
Don't make it too soon,

01:04:52.037 --> 01:04:53.272
you have an assignment.

01:05:04.249 --> 01:05:05.384
Okay.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:08.020
Carlene wants Gabby
to make contact with Luis.

01:05:09.955 --> 01:05:10.990
Are you ready?

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:35.747
So you gonna wish me luck?

01:05:36.981 --> 01:05:38.117
Kamal.

01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:41.017
I know.

01:05:41.019 --> 01:05:42.718
No, you don't. You've done
more for this country

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.356
and it's national security
than...

01:05:45.156 --> 01:05:46.392
most people I know.

01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:53.232
Be careful...

01:05:54.332 --> 01:05:55.501
and come back safe.

01:06:10.115 --> 01:06:11.317
Get the engines ready.

01:06:12.182 --> 01:06:13.318
We leave tomorrow.

01:06:53.158 --> 01:06:55.428
We can't drive any further
than this without being seen.

01:07:05.537 --> 01:07:07.138
Islamberg.

01:07:09.107 --> 01:07:10.205
Apparently,
they have other camps

01:07:10.207 --> 01:07:12.176
called Islamtown and Islamville.

01:07:12.443 --> 01:07:13.545
Huh.

01:07:30.162 --> 01:07:31.763
- Let's follow him.
- All right.

01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:04.429
Hi, welcome
to O'Neil's. How many?

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.800
- Hi, um... Oh, I'm with him.
- Okay, sure.

01:08:13.738 --> 01:08:14.839
Hi, Dean.

01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:19.712
What, you don't remember me
from the shelter?

01:08:23.113 --> 01:08:24.514
Yes, of course.

01:08:26.216 --> 01:08:27.750
- Are you hungry?
- Always.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.689
Wow, this is nice.

01:08:33.557 --> 01:08:34.658
You, um...

01:08:35.327 --> 01:08:38.529
- win the lottery?
- No, no I got a job.

01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:40.633
Oh.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:43.702
With the man that brought
all the chicken?

01:08:46.404 --> 01:08:48.304
Would you like to hear
our specials?

01:08:48.305 --> 01:08:49.604
No, thank you.

01:08:54.578 --> 01:08:55.779
What's in the bag, Dean?

01:09:00.785 --> 01:09:02.020
Nothing.

01:09:08.827 --> 01:09:10.395
Did I ever tell you about this?

01:09:12.395 --> 01:09:13.798
It was my grandfather's.

01:09:14.665 --> 01:09:17.500
And he... he got it for serving
in World War II.

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:21.640
My family gave it to me
after he passed.

01:09:22.573 --> 01:09:24.475
Freedom from fear and want.

01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:27.812
Freedom of speech and religion.

01:09:32.283 --> 01:09:33.452
You know I served?

01:09:34.685 --> 01:09:36.354
Operation Noble Eagle.

01:09:37.254 --> 01:09:38.889
It was shortly after 9/11,

01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:42.828
I was deployed with the 107th
maintenance company, mechanic.

01:09:45.196 --> 01:09:46.832
Man, I loved being a soldier.

01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:51.634
Then my feet got all screwed up

01:09:51.636 --> 01:09:53.603
and I was no longer fit
for duty.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:59.445
No fancy war story or anything,
just a...

01:10:00.811 --> 01:10:03.582
24-year-old with arthritis
and jacked up feet.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.550
I really loved my job.

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:14.827
Now I'm just a disabled vet
running a homeless shelter.

01:10:17.427 --> 01:10:18.631
Man, I miss it.

01:10:20.665 --> 01:10:22.534
I had a much better life once.

01:10:26.904 --> 01:10:28.504
Yeah, I reckon you did.

01:10:33.445 --> 01:10:34.613
But you know what Dean...

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.650
one day we're gonna dance
on streets of gold

01:10:40.519 --> 01:10:43.620
and we're gonna sleep in a house
bigger than the White House.

01:10:43.922 --> 01:10:45.822
- You know that?
- <i>Detonate a car bomb</i>

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:47.492
<i>outside a heavily,
populated area.</i>

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:49.425
More information on
the explosives are slowly...

01:10:49.427 --> 01:10:50.827
Hey, can you turn that up?

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:52.428
<i>Adetra is the younger brother</i>

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.764
<i>of Al-Qaeda operative
Muhammad Jiran who is suspected</i>

01:10:54.766 --> 01:10:56.568
<i>to have joined
the terrorist regime, ISIS.</i>

01:10:56.967 --> 01:10:58.503
They ought to kill that man.

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:00.672
Are you okay?

01:11:01.739 --> 01:11:02.774
Yeah.

01:11:04.877 --> 01:11:05.977
I'm not sure.

01:11:08.579 --> 01:11:09.714
Do you know him?

01:11:10.548 --> 01:11:11.783
No, no.

01:11:13.819 --> 01:11:14.886
I just...

01:11:15.419 --> 01:11:18.390
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

01:11:20.926 --> 01:11:22.561
I'm supposed to do something.

01:11:24.561 --> 01:11:25.997
Something when that happens.

01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:28.099
What are you supposed to do?

01:11:29.601 --> 01:11:31.804
- I can't.
- Give me the bag, Dean.

01:11:39.477 --> 01:11:40.677
<i>He's being
taken there now.</i>

01:11:40.979 --> 01:11:42.347
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

01:11:43.047 --> 01:11:44.115
Campbell.

01:11:44.348 --> 01:11:46.618
Have you lost
your tiny frog-sized mind?

01:11:46.985 --> 01:11:48.385
Hi, Erin.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.852
It's good to see you too,
Carlene.

01:11:49.854 --> 01:11:51.923
Seriously, have you lost
your mind?

01:11:52.824 --> 01:11:54.092
- Maybe.
- Hey Alex,

01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:57.363
let's, uh, take this
to the conference room.

01:11:59.029 --> 01:12:00.565
Oh, hi Alex.

01:12:02.534 --> 01:12:05.604
Carlene, we're watching
Kamal's every move...

01:12:06.471 --> 01:12:08.973
- as best we can.
- Soup, he's on his own.

01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:11.575
I know.

01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.579
Listen, we have to find
the trigger.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.049
We've got to do something
to stop this national tragedy.

01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:19.917
Let me show you what we got.

01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:27.926
You kept this?

01:12:29.727 --> 01:12:31.096
After all this time.

01:12:37.502 --> 01:12:38.504
Yeah.

01:15:59.936 --> 01:16:02.239
All that these old men know

01:16:02.673 --> 01:16:06.278
that new generation
of rebel are at war.

01:16:07.012 --> 01:16:08.180
Educate them.

01:16:09.079 --> 01:16:10.716
Maybe, they came from Egypt...

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.085
to attend universities.

01:16:15.887 --> 01:16:16.989
All the guys.

01:17:02.033 --> 01:17:03.299
You really have
everyone worked up

01:17:03.301 --> 01:17:04.936
over this perfect day theory.

01:17:08.739 --> 01:17:10.074
I don't know, Carlene.

01:17:11.275 --> 01:17:12.711
What if it all happened?

01:17:14.244 --> 01:17:16.047
It's just too much coincidence.

01:17:18.015 --> 01:17:20.118
An ISIS leader talks
about the perfect day.

01:17:21.819 --> 01:17:24.321
A guy buys 2,500 pounds
of fertilizer.

01:17:25.123 --> 01:17:28.460
Islamic extremist groups
are popping up all over the US.

01:17:30.194 --> 01:17:32.995
Some guy from Canada
is bringing in thousands,

01:17:32.997 --> 01:17:35.901
if not millions of dollars
across the border unknown.

01:17:36.967 --> 01:17:39.102
- Wait, Canada?
- Yeah.

01:17:39.803 --> 01:17:42.973
Some guy's made a dozen trips
into the US via Lake Erie.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.974
There's a man from Canada
that we believe

01:17:44.976 --> 01:17:46.444
is targeting kids
through video games

01:17:46.677 --> 01:17:49.077
to perform acts of violence
in schools. We...

01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:51.182
Soup, you'll never believe this.

01:17:53.418 --> 01:17:55.151
At a local school
during a basketball game,

01:17:55.153 --> 01:17:56.986
this man attempted
a mass shooting.

01:17:56.988 --> 01:17:59.057
But the locals jumped him
before he had a chance.

01:18:00.725 --> 01:18:01.827
Oh my.

01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:04.292
The FBI field office
in Grand Rapids

01:18:04.294 --> 01:18:05.462
just interviewed a man
who was hired

01:18:05.696 --> 01:18:07.397
to take revenge
on his former employer.

01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:11.367
It says, "The man paid him
20,000 dollars to buy firearms

01:18:11.369 --> 01:18:12.902
to kill people from the place
of work

01:18:12.904 --> 01:18:14.272
where he was
recently terminated.

01:18:14.705 --> 01:18:15.904
The man turned himself in,

01:18:15.906 --> 01:18:17.773
and told the FBI
that he was to conduct

01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:19.242
the killing spree
on the same day

01:18:19.244 --> 01:18:21.112
a bombing was to occur."

01:18:21.846 --> 01:18:23.246
He said it was supposed
to happen this month,

01:18:23.248 --> 01:18:24.880
and he thought when Kamal
was arrested

01:18:24.882 --> 01:18:26.083
the mission was a failure.

01:18:26.883 --> 01:18:29.421
Carlene, it's the same guy.

01:18:31.021 --> 01:18:31.988
So,

01:18:32.757 --> 01:18:34.255
this guy is funneling in cash

01:18:34.257 --> 01:18:37.026
and hiring terrorists to perform
these types of attacks?

01:18:37.028 --> 01:18:39.094
I mean, this guy in Grand Rapid,
the school in Denver,

01:18:39.096 --> 01:18:40.331
the kids in Florida.

01:18:41.231 --> 01:18:42.833
How many more would there be?

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.435
Countless.

01:18:46.337 --> 01:18:47.405
Kamal.

01:18:48.204 --> 01:18:49.774
You've got to get him
out of that prison.

01:19:12.163 --> 01:19:13.931
Hi, I'm sorry.

01:19:14.431 --> 01:19:16.867
Could I bum a cigarette?
It's been a rough week.

01:19:17.267 --> 01:19:18.470
It'd just be one.

01:19:44.462 --> 01:19:46.897
So where you from?

01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:49.367
Dallas.

01:19:50.467 --> 01:19:51.970
What brings you out this way?

01:19:55.338 --> 01:19:57.475
My brother brought my here.

01:19:57.874 --> 01:20:02.012
When our parents got killed
in a car accident, drunk driver.

01:20:03.414 --> 01:20:05.915
He moved our family here
to get away

01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:08.153
from the western culture,
you know.

01:20:09.587 --> 01:20:11.990
Away from the crime, drugs...

01:20:12.824 --> 01:20:14.090
the evil.

01:20:14.092 --> 01:20:15.493
Now we live under, uh...

01:20:16.494 --> 01:20:18.530
the ruling of our Holy Imam.

01:20:19.029 --> 01:20:21.432
Yeah, he's a spiritual leader
who guides our lives.

01:20:23.901 --> 01:20:25.836
- Like a commune?
- No.

01:20:26.904 --> 01:20:29.040
Our community
is of like-minded people.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.242
Though it's religious
in nature it's...

01:20:31.475 --> 01:20:33.544
it's a bond
between brothers and sisters.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.481
We're always looking
for new believers.

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:39.117
- Believers?
- Yeah.

01:20:39.984 --> 01:20:41.319
I'm a follower of Islam.

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:47.024
And uh, as a Muslim woman,
I believe in Allah

01:20:47.257 --> 01:20:48.459
and the teachings of Muhammad.

01:20:49.927 --> 01:20:53.397
We would sacrifice our own lives
for our beliefs.

01:20:54.565 --> 01:20:57.433
We're striving
for a perfect future world,

01:20:57.435 --> 01:21:01.039
a global califate of...
of only believers.

01:21:01.571 --> 01:21:02.574
Yeah?

01:21:03.606 --> 01:21:05.176
And those who don't believe,

01:21:05.609 --> 01:21:07.044
they should be converted...

01:21:08.145 --> 01:21:09.247
or punished.

01:21:11.181 --> 01:21:12.383
You know what I think?

01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:18.286
I think you hide behind
the teachings of Islam

01:21:18.288 --> 01:21:20.291
without really understanding
the religion at all.

01:21:21.891 --> 01:21:25.495
I have Muslim friends,
they're doctors and teachers.

01:21:26.163 --> 01:21:28.098
My nieces play with their kids.

01:21:28.499 --> 01:21:31.567
My brother fought in Iraq
alongside Muslims

01:21:31.569 --> 01:21:34.504
who believe in freedom,
real freedom,

01:21:34.939 --> 01:21:36.473
and religious diversity.

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:39.642
Your view of Islam
is nothing more

01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:41.646
than a twist of distortion
of your faith.

01:21:42.212 --> 01:21:44.647
And gives good Muslims,
like my friends, a bad name.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:46.048
Yeah.

01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:47.252
This conversation's over.

01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:49.721
You know what...

01:21:50.622 --> 01:21:52.057
your justice is coming.

01:22:09.406 --> 01:22:12.976
I can't believe the gall
of these people.

01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:16.579
Living in our country
and enjoying our freedoms,

01:22:17.213 --> 01:22:19.215
yet, creating
their own communities

01:22:19.217 --> 01:22:21.082
and talking about
how they want to punish us

01:22:21.084 --> 01:22:22.252
for our beliefs.

01:22:22.453 --> 01:22:24.522
- They're... they're just...
- Brainwashed?

01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:28.325
Are they dangerous?

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.261
Possibly.

01:22:31.227 --> 01:22:33.562
Would they blindly do whatever
some crazed religious leader

01:22:33.564 --> 01:22:34.665
told them to do?

01:22:35.966 --> 01:22:36.735
I think so.

01:22:37.502 --> 01:22:39.236
And that's what scares me.

01:22:40.238 --> 01:22:43.038
We have to stop
these radicalized ideologies

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.109
that disguise themselves
under religion.

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:47.608
We have to find these camps
and communities

01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:50.179
that are hiding in plain sight
within our borders

01:22:50.181 --> 01:22:51.482
and shut them down.

01:22:53.383 --> 01:22:54.586
Got it, thanks.

01:22:55.718 --> 01:22:56.787
That was the FBI.

01:22:57.354 --> 01:22:59.688
They're partnering with the
ATF, DEA, and the state police

01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:00.657
to conduct these raids.

01:23:01.057 --> 01:23:02.525
We're just waiting on California
and Montana.

01:23:02.726 --> 01:23:04.595
- When?
- Midnight tonight, sir.

01:23:05.061 --> 01:23:06.229
Okay.

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:08.729
Right now,
we have 14 attorney generals

01:23:08.731 --> 01:23:11.301
agreeing to conduct
simultaneous raids on the camps.

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:13.805
The governor of Colorado says,
bring in the troops,

01:23:14.038 --> 01:23:15.737
he doesn't want
this terrorist activity

01:23:15.739 --> 01:23:18.107
conducted in his state,
his exact words.

01:23:18.109 --> 01:23:19.142
That's great.

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:21.243
- Kamal's out.
- What?

01:23:21.245 --> 01:23:22.777
- Yes.
- He's fine.

01:23:22.779 --> 01:23:24.513
Alex, look up
an Egyptian student

01:23:24.515 --> 01:23:25.749
at Ohio State.

01:23:27.418 --> 01:23:28.649
Do you have him on the phone?

01:23:28.651 --> 01:23:30.454
Not yet,
he's still being debriefed.

01:23:31.055 --> 01:23:33.788
We have 34 students
that transferred to Ohio State,

01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:35.292
and the last three
was from Egypt.

01:23:35.559 --> 01:23:38.762
Okay, cross reference
those with local police,

01:23:39.296 --> 01:23:41.399
uh, religious affiliations.

01:23:42.165 --> 01:23:44.434
Maybe someone
studying engineering.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.100
- Yeah.
- Religion.

01:23:46.102 --> 01:23:48.739
Finances. Find a kid
who's current on his bills

01:23:49.406 --> 01:23:50.775
and probably off campus.

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:54.845
Azzi Hidal and Beiber Sethos.

01:23:56.314 --> 01:23:57.712
Oh, this is our guy.

01:23:57.714 --> 01:23:59.747
Azzi Hidal works
as a part time security guard

01:23:59.749 --> 01:24:01.416
at Lakeside Storage Unit.

01:24:01.418 --> 01:24:04.756
Yesterday at 1800,
he tweeted Quran 8:39,

01:24:05.289 --> 01:24:07.790
"Fight them all
until all opposition ends

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:09.327
and all submit to Allah."

01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:21.638
Erik, it's Soup.

01:24:22.406 --> 01:24:24.708
Alex is gonna send
the information to Niki.

01:24:25.676 --> 01:24:27.111
Yeah, it's coming in now.

01:24:27.477 --> 01:24:30.147
- Got it.
- Now, if we can find this guy,

01:24:30.448 --> 01:24:32.617
we may have a chance
to stop this whole thing.

01:24:37.186 --> 01:24:38.323
It's a left here.

01:24:41.859 --> 01:24:43.260
Niki, what is it?

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.329
We're going to his dorm.

01:24:46.462 --> 01:24:48.232
He won't be mixing
a bomb in a dorm.

01:24:51.435 --> 01:24:52.637
The report says...

01:24:57.107 --> 01:24:59.276
Azzi works at a storage unit.

01:25:01.244 --> 01:25:03.547
Erik, this is only a few miles
away from here.

01:25:05.449 --> 01:25:08.218
- Is that a blue van?
- Looks like it.

01:25:23.132 --> 01:25:24.666
All right. Ryan,
you go around the back.

01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:25.903
Niki, you take the front.

01:25:26.137 --> 01:25:27.603
I'll circle around
and see what I can see.

01:25:27.605 --> 01:25:29.205
- Yes, sir.
- Copy that.

01:26:13.217 --> 01:26:14.385
Police, don't move!

01:26:16.186 --> 01:26:18.589
Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.270
Everybody good?

01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:33.837
Yeah, I'm good.

01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:42.247
He's gone.

01:26:43.847 --> 01:26:45.613
Call the local authorities
and get 'em out here.

01:26:45.615 --> 01:26:46.850
Roger that.

01:26:52.789 --> 01:26:54.024
- Soup.
- <i>Is everyone okay?</i>

01:26:54.257 --> 01:26:55.559
Everyone is okay.

01:26:55.859 --> 01:26:57.158
<i>We have to make sure
this stays off the news</i>

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.462
- <i>and the internet.</i>
- All right.

01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:03.666
<i>Over 34 compounds
in the United States</i>

01:27:03.668 --> 01:27:05.035
<i>were raided that night.</i>

01:27:05.269 --> 01:27:06.934
<i>They didn't see it coming.</i>

01:27:06.936 --> 01:27:09.906
<i>Over 100 national fugitives
were found in these camps.</i>

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.977
<i>Charges ranging from petty
larceny, to rape, even murder.</i>

01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:17.513
<i>Suicide bomb vests were found
along with stockpiled</i>

01:27:17.515 --> 01:27:21.015
<i>explosives and weapons.
They found assassination plots,</i>

01:27:21.017 --> 01:27:23.053
<i>large amounts
of American currency,</i>

01:27:23.287 --> 01:27:25.722
<i>and automatic
unregistered firearms.</i>

01:27:26.723 --> 01:27:29.827
<i>Luis was found with
over 100,000 dollars in cash.</i>

01:27:30.261 --> 01:27:31.660
<i>And they found
a flight reservation</i>

01:27:31.662 --> 01:27:33.597
<i>in his name to Florida.</i>

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.501
<i>After high school, Gabby joined
the United States Marine Corp.</i>

01:27:39.503 --> 01:27:41.603
<i>From what I've been told,
there was one heck</i>

01:27:41.605 --> 01:27:42.639
