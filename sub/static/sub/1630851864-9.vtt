09:48.587 --> 09:51.673
Our legend is an old Irish tale.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.384
I mean corned beef,
cabbage, beer, kilts.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.553
We saw how fast
you were crossing the moat.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.764
Now, let's see how smart
you are on the steps.

09:58.806 --> 10:02.601
So listen carefully because
Olmec is about to tell you

10:02.643 --> 10:06.147
the origins of
the Deadly Spear of Cú Chulainn.

10:06.187 --> 10:07.648
Olmec.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.278
With every year, Cú Chulainn
grows more handsome and fierce.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.655
His reputation
for carousing also grows,

10:15.697 --> 10:19.284
leading to the prophecy
that he will surely be famous,

10:19.326 --> 10:22.078
but die young.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.416
He sows his wild oats
until smitten by Emer,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.793
the beautiful daughter
of the King of Luska.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.298
But the king devices
a plan to get rid of him.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.091
KING:
If you want to see Emer,

10:34.133 --> 10:36.217
go to the Isle of Skye,

10:36.259 --> 10:40.931
and be trained by the warrior
woman, Scáthach, and return.

10:40.972 --> 10:44.601
OLMEC: The king knows the
journey is likely to kill him.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.855
Cú Chulainn ventures
through the perilous glen

10:47.897 --> 10:49.565
where a magic wheel and an apple

10:49.606 --> 10:52.902
help him survive
the treacherous terrain.

10:52.942 --> 10:54.945
When he finally arrives,

10:54.986 --> 10:57.947
Scáthach is so impressed
he survived the journey,

10:57.990 --> 11:00.493
she agrees to train him.

11:00.533 --> 11:04.830
He spars for a fortnight with
another soldier named Ferdiad,

11:04.871 --> 11:08.333
the only one to match
his talent and strength.

11:08.375 --> 11:11.169
Cú Chulainn becomes
such a fierce fighter,

11:11.211 --> 11:14.798
that Scáthach rewards
him with a deadly spear,

11:14.840 --> 11:16.759
the Gae Bulg,

11:16.801 --> 11:19.761
and he and Ferdiad
are forever blood brothers.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.265
Cú Chulainn returns to Luska
and confronts the king.

11:24.307 --> 11:27.144
CU CHULAINN:
I've come to take your daughter.

11:27.394 --> 11:30.480
OLMEC: But the king
stubbornly refuses him again.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.234
So Cú Chulainn
pulls out the Gae Bulg,

11:33.274 --> 11:36.445
slays 24
of the king's best men,

11:36.486 --> 11:38.989
and liberates Emer.

11:39.030 --> 11:41.116
The two lovers
ransack the castle

11:41.158 --> 11:43.994
and elope with most
of her father's wealth.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.581
After a few years of wedded
bliss and ever the warrior,

11:48.624 --> 11:51.793
Cú Chulainn
is called into action.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.629
The legend
of Cú Chulainn speaks to me

11:53.671 --> 11:55.423
because he's always
pushing through,

11:55.463 --> 11:58.174
no matter what comes his
way in the face of adversity.

11:58.216 --> 12:00.177
And I know that
I'm the same way.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.721
If anything tries
to get in my way,

12:01.761 --> 12:03.139
I'm just gonna
push right through it.

12:03.179 --> 12:05.307
Now there's only three teams

12:05.349 --> 12:08.769
and we definitely want it more
now because when we are closer,

12:08.811 --> 12:09.979
so I'm ready for you guys.

12:10.019 --> 12:11.522
[both laughing]

12:11.563 --> 12:12.981
CRISTELA:
All right, teams.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.609
These
are the Steps of Knowledge.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.528
Olmec is about
to ask you questions

12:17.570 --> 12:19.488
about the Irish
legend of Cú Chulainn.

12:19.529 --> 12:22.365
He will also ask you
general knowledge questions

12:22.408 --> 12:24.284
related to the story.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.036
Once he asks the questions,

12:26.077 --> 12:28.663
stomp on the ancient mark
in front of you to answer.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.207
If correct,
you'll take a step down.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.043
If you're not correct
or you take too long,

12:34.086 --> 12:35.921
the other teams
will have a chance.

12:35.962 --> 12:37.505
The first two teams to come down

12:37.548 --> 12:39.508
will move forward
to the Temple Games.

12:39.549 --> 12:42.595
The last team, unfortunately,

12:42.635 --> 12:43.846
will be out.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.221
You ready?

12:45.264 --> 12:46.807
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.726
All right.
Olmec, first question, please.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.938
To where does Cú Chulainn travel
to be trained by Scáthach?

12:53.980 --> 12:55.774
[feet stomping]

12:55.816 --> 12:56.984
Blue Barracudas.

12:57.025 --> 12:58.818
The Isle of Skye.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.197
That is correct.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.740
Yeah!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.240
Take a step, please.

13:04.991 --> 13:07.495
Olmec, next question.

13:07.535 --> 13:09.830
Cú Chulainn crosses
the perilous glen,

13:09.871 --> 13:13.292
with the help
of a magic wheel and what?

13:13.333 --> 13:15.794
-[feet stomping]
-Blue Barracudas.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.129
An apple.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.798
That is correct.

13:18.838 --> 13:21.716
Oh, Blue Barracudas,
you on a mission today.

13:21.759 --> 13:22.927
Okay.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.888
The Blue Barracudas
think they have the edge,

13:25.929 --> 13:27.472
but I know what
Malcolm's capable of,

13:27.514 --> 13:29.475
and I know he can
get us down to the bottom.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.434
Olmec, next question.

13:31.476 --> 13:34.980
What is the name
of the young soldier

13:35.022 --> 13:37.399
who was able to match
Cú Chulainn's talents?

13:37.441 --> 13:38.859
♪♪♪

13:38.900 --> 13:41.611
Menallor, Ferdiad,

13:41.653 --> 13:44.490
Simeon or Tantalus?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.825
Red Jaguars.

13:45.865 --> 13:46.951
Ferdiad.

13:46.991 --> 13:48.409
That is correct.

13:48.451 --> 13:50.913
Oh, congratulations,
Red Jaguars.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.665
At this point I'm--
I'm looking at Natasha and I--

13:53.706 --> 13:56.793
I'm seeing that she's
just not getting what's--

13:56.836 --> 13:58.754
what's happening.
I'm like, oh no.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.381
Olmec, next question.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.924
If Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad

14:02.966 --> 14:05.594
trained fiercely
for a fortnight,

14:05.635 --> 14:08.013
how many days will they train?

14:08.054 --> 14:09.849
-[feet stomping]
-Red Jaguars.

14:09.889 --> 14:11.015
Fourteen.

14:11.057 --> 14:12.433
That is correct.

14:12.684 --> 14:15.479
Ooh, Red Jaguars,
you're taking a step down.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.147
My mind went blank.

14:17.188 --> 14:19.899
I realized in this moment
that my comprehension

14:19.942 --> 14:22.278
is not that great. My listening
skills, I thought were good,

14:22.318 --> 14:24.238
are not as good as I thought.

14:24.279 --> 14:26.322
I just don't want to go home
with zero questions right.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.866
Olmec, the next question.

14:28.658 --> 14:32.203
What is the capital
of Northern Ireland?

14:32.245 --> 14:34.206
-Red Jaguars.
-Belfast.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.375
That is correct.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.168
Oh, Red Jaguars,
congratulations!

14:39.211 --> 14:41.797
You are the first ones
moving to the Temple Games.

14:41.838 --> 14:43.423
We made it through the moat,

14:43.465 --> 14:44.966
we made it through the steps,

14:45.009 --> 14:46.552
and now there's
just one more obstacle

14:46.594 --> 14:48.345
before we can get to the temple.

14:48.386 --> 14:50.179
We still got one more spot.

14:50.221 --> 14:52.390
Olmec, next question.

14:52.432 --> 14:55.936
Robert De Niro,
Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci,

14:55.977 --> 14:59.523
all starred in what 2019 film?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.984
Parasite, The Irishman,

15:02.025 --> 15:03.360
-The Kingsmen.
-[beeping]

15:03.402 --> 15:05.321
-Purple Parrots.
-The Irishman.

15:05.361 --> 15:07.197
That is correct.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.198
Oh, yes.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.744
I'm feeling a little bit
energized. I feel like

15:11.784 --> 15:13.578
now we're in the game.
We're gonna get it done.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.496
-We do have a chance.
-We could catch up.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.832
Olmec, next question.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.376
The national flag of Ireland

15:20.418 --> 15:25.256
features stripes of green,
white, and what other color?

15:25.298 --> 15:27.216
-[beeping]
-Blue Barracudas?

15:27.259 --> 15:28.469
Yellow.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.220
Incorrect.

15:30.261 --> 15:33.389
Definitely could have
known more about Ireland.

15:34.682 --> 15:35.893
-Purple Parrots.
-Orange.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.727
That is correct.

15:37.769 --> 15:40.147
Oh, oh. We got a tied game.

15:40.188 --> 15:41.774
Oh, no way.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.734
No way it's happening
in front of my eyes.

15:43.775 --> 15:45.985
Oh, man.
We got Blue Barracudas,

15:46.028 --> 15:48.197
Purple Parrots
right neck to neck

15:48.238 --> 15:51.325
to get the final spot
and move on to the Temple Games.

15:51.366 --> 15:54.577
This is the moment
to beat them and when.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.663
I think we're both
sweating at this point.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.874
Coming down
to the last question.

15:58.915 --> 16:00.708
Olmec.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.336
Next question, please.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.921
The beautiful Emer,

16:03.962 --> 16:07.256
is the daughter
of the king of where?

16:07.298 --> 16:09.467
Luska, Luka,

16:09.509 --> 16:11.135
-Luke, Batonga.
-[beeping]

16:11.177 --> 16:12.261
Blue Barracudas.

16:12.303 --> 16:13.514
Luska.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.933
That is correct.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.687
Oh, Blue Barracudas!

16:19.727 --> 16:23.315
Take a step down. You will
be going to the Temple Games.

16:23.356 --> 16:24.942
Ready for adventure #3?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.275
That's what
we came to do, right?

16:26.317 --> 16:27.735
-Adventure #3.
-Cú Chulainn.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.072
Channeling
Cú Chulainn all day long

16:30.114 --> 16:31.532
to the end, baby.

16:31.572 --> 16:35.034
[humming and laughing loudly]

16:35.076 --> 16:37.413
Purple Parrots, that means
you're not moving forward.

16:37.453 --> 16:39.581
But you're not
leaving empty-handed.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.500
-What are they getting?
-ANNOUNCER: On top of

16:41.542 --> 16:43.961
your Purple Parrot shirts,
you're going home with

16:44.003 --> 16:46.838
a whole bunch of Legends of the
Hidden Temple signature swag.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.634
Including limited edition hats,
beach towels, sports chairs,

16:50.676 --> 16:54.138
spike ball sets and giant Olmec
party coolers for each of you.

16:54.178 --> 16:56.014
CRISTELA:
It's the battle of the brothers.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.017
The Red Jaguars
and Blue Barracudas

16:58.057 --> 17:00.351
are one step closer to
racing through Olmec's Temple

17:00.394 --> 17:02.354
for $25,000.

17:02.395 --> 17:03.688
You're doing it!

[cheering]

17:07.984 --> 17:11.404
[cheering]

17:11.446 --> 17:14.032
Welcome back to
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.368
Okay, so you've seen
the heroes cross Olmec's moat

17:17.411 --> 17:19.954
and make their way
down the Steps of Knowledge.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.833
Now, the only thing
standing between them

17:22.875 --> 17:26.586
and a shot of $25,000
are these Temple Games.

17:26.627 --> 17:29.882
Still with us, we've got Matt
and Malcolm, the Red Jaguars.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.301
♪ We got to do our best
to get to Olmec ♪

17:33.343 --> 17:36.430
♪ And not be scared
of the temple gods ♪

17:36.471 --> 17:39.307
♪ Running, jumping,
pushing limits ♪

17:39.348 --> 17:42.478
♪ The Red Jaguars
will work so hard ♪

17:42.519 --> 17:45.772
And Josh and Justin,
the Blue Barracudas.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.691
I think we have
a physical advantage.

17:47.732 --> 17:49.526
They are smart,

17:49.777 --> 17:52.070
so I don't wanna
discount them too much.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.905
Both teams, you know,

17:53.947 --> 17:57.576
you're competing
for these pendants of life.

17:57.617 --> 17:59.952
[applauding]

17:59.994 --> 18:02.580
Now you will need
them to protect yourself

18:02.623 --> 18:06.835
from the dreaded temple guards
as you run Olmec's Temple.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.755
The first team that
gets two pendants of life

18:09.797 --> 18:11.882
have proven themselves worthy

18:11.923 --> 18:14.801
and will be allowed
to enter Olmec's Temple.

18:14.843 --> 18:18.763
The first game will
be played one team at a time.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.641
Red Jaguars,
you won the Steps of Knowledge

18:20.682 --> 18:22.351
and you have chosen to go first.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.394
-Yep, that's great.
-All right, Red Jaguars,

18:24.435 --> 18:26.270
it's time
for you to go get ready.

18:28.022 --> 18:31.567
And now Olmec will tell
us more about temple game #1.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.113
Cú Chulainn is called

18:34.153 --> 18:36.656
to defend
the nearby province of Ulster

18:36.698 --> 18:39.326
from Medb,
the Queen of Connacht,

18:39.367 --> 18:42.162
who sent
her entire army to Ulster

18:42.203 --> 18:44.539
to steal their prized bull...

18:44.580 --> 18:46.458
NoBull.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.585
The men of Ulster
can't defend the bull

18:48.626 --> 18:51.171
because they had been
cursed with feebleness

18:51.212 --> 18:54.967
by a phantom
goddess named Morrigan.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.719
Cú Chulainn
single-handedly slays

18:57.760 --> 18:59.762
dozens of Medb's soldiers,

18:59.805 --> 19:01.722
waiting
for the curse to wear off.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.726
She wants
to wear Cú Chulainn down.

19:04.768 --> 19:08.438
He wants to stall while
the men of Ulster recover.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.817
Cú Chulainn kills
every one of Medb's soldiers

19:11.858 --> 19:15.028
until she sends in,
you guessed it,

19:15.069 --> 19:18.490
his best friend
and blood brother, Ferdiad.

19:18.531 --> 19:21.285
The reluctant combatants
fight fiercely,

19:21.326 --> 19:25.163
but at night they kiss
and embrace before resting.

19:25.204 --> 19:30.669
The fight goes on for three
days until Ferdiad is dead.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.713
