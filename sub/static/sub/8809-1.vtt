03:26.790 --> 03:30.042
You know, I just had a thought.

03:30.252 --> 03:35.673
I'll go check in a hotel and get
some rest, and you go find your folks.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.969
Let's go meet them. The sooner
it's over with, the better.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.306
Mom will be out to lunch.
Dad's at his office.

03:43.515 --> 03:47.226
- You may not meet them till dinner.
- You may be wrong about them.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.937
You should've told them
we were coming.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.399
It may be the biggest shock
of your young life.

03:53.609 --> 03:58.321
After 23 years of living with them,
don't you think I know them?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.448
I hope so.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.742
There's no problem.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.382
We'll be a minute, then we'd
like to go to Claremont Drive.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.176
All right.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.310
I'll see if Mom's in the office.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.320
- Joey?
- Hilary, hi. How are you?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.822
What a surprise!

04:42.032 --> 04:44.992
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Okay.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.586
- Strange.
- One of Hilary's favorites.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.674
- It's called a kinetic sculpture.
- A what?

04:59.883 --> 05:03.260
Look.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.097
Why, isn't that someth...?

05:09.017 --> 05:13.104
- What are you doing here?
- I thought Mother might be here.

05:13.313 --> 05:17.858
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Prentice.
- I'm so pleased to meet you.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.319
Pleasure to see you.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.366
Christina's lunching with Mr. Cazelet.
I can ring up.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.785
Just tell her I'm back
and that I'll be home.

05:27.995 --> 05:32.039
Has something happened?
Is anything wrong?

05:32.249 --> 05:35.543
Something's happened,
but everything's right.

05:35.711 --> 05:41.132
- How was Hawaii? Was it fun?
- Hawaii was simply unbelievable.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.387
Do you live in San Francisco, doctor,
or are you visiting?

05:46.596 --> 05:50.307
Just passing through.
It was a pleasure to have met you.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.184
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.670
Hilary runs the gallery,
but it's Mom who has all the ideas.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.840
Her idea to put originals
in hotel rooms is brilliant.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.469
Gives people time
to decide if they like them.

06:26.678 --> 06:31.599
The hotel gets free decor, the guests
can look at good paintings...

06:31.808 --> 06:35.352
...the painter can make a sale,
and Mom gets a commission.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.354
Take the next right.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.358
- Isn't that clever?
- That is clever.

07:24.194 --> 07:28.072
- What do I owe you?
- Ten-fifty, Mac.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.991
Twelve bucks, right?

07:31.952 --> 07:37.373
Right.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.375
John, come meet Tillie.

07:42.963 --> 07:47.174
Tillie, this is Dr. Prentice.
John, Miss Matilda Binks.

07:47.384 --> 07:52.680
Pleased to meet you, Miss Binks.
I've heard a great deal about you.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.643
What are you doing home unexpected?
You told them you're back?

07:57.853 --> 08:02.231
I left a message for Mom.
It's lovely to see you! I missed you.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.901
Why are you home?
You want those bags upstairs?

08:06.111 --> 08:10.739
- Not my two. I've not come to stay.
- I'll tell you all about it.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.450
You eat any lunch yet,
or are you expecting it now?

08:13.660 --> 08:18.330
Could you make us sandwiches?
We'll have it on the terrace.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.148
Do you like it?

08:45.275 --> 08:49.778
- It's beautiful.
- Come out and look from the terrace.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.037
- What?
- Hey, who's that?

09:01.875 --> 09:05.711
That's Dorothy. Isn't she a knockout?
She helps Tillie during the week.

09:05.921 --> 09:09.131
- Which days?
- Never mind.

09:13.470 --> 09:18.349
- I ought to call my folks.
- Use the phone in the study.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.518
- Will you introduce me?
- Not on the phone.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.104
- Won't you tell them?
- I'd rather write.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.775
I have to meet them
before I come to Geneva.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.654
Or will we keep our marriage
a secret from them?

09:31.863 --> 09:35.324
Why didn't I think of that?
See, that's a thought.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.078
I'll shut this in case Dorothy
goes by.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.742
Los Angeles, please. Area code 213.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.704
Axminister 246-99. Time and charges.

10:21.955 --> 10:26.500
I've got a right to my own opinions,
and you want my opinion?

10:26.710 --> 10:30.045
I don't like one of my race
getting above himself.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.507
If I ever want your opinion,
I'll ask for...

10:33.717 --> 10:37.761
Oh, Tillie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.807
But you can't mean what you're saying,
and you're so wrong.

10:42.017 --> 10:45.019
You're the last person I'd expect...

10:45.228 --> 10:47.646
...to take such a silly attitude.

10:47.856 --> 10:52.026
I've always loved you,
and you're just as black as he is.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.821
It's right for me to love you
and wrong to love him?

10:56.031 --> 10:59.116
Just stop and think about that.

10:59.576 --> 11:04.538
- What's for dinner tonight?
- Celery soup and rump steak.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.583
Come on! Turtle soup and tournedos.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.252
And one of your best pies?

11:10.545 --> 11:12.629
It's Mom!

11:13.840 --> 11:16.425
Joey? Darling?

11:16.634 --> 11:19.053
- What the hell? Joey?
- Mom!

11:19.262 --> 11:22.014
Darling, are you all right?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.932
Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!

11:24.142 --> 11:27.644
I rang the gallery to tell Hilary
that Cazelet had agreed to...

11:27.854 --> 11:30.814
He has? That's marvelous!

11:31.024 --> 11:35.444
She thought you might have a surprise.
What did she mean?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.530
Do I hear someone?
Is there someone here?

11:38.740 --> 11:43.160
Mom! I've never been so happy
in all my life! I'm just...

11:43.370 --> 11:45.871
Bursting. I can see that.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.832
I'm feeling happy for you.
Do I know him?

11:49.042 --> 11:52.127
I only met him myself 10 days ago.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.130
You won't believe
what's happened in 10 days!

11:55.340 --> 11:59.927
I might, if you'd pipe down
long enough to tell me.

12:00.136 --> 12:04.723
- Wonderful things have happened in...
- Mom, he's so wonderful.

12:04.974 --> 12:08.394
I've never known anyone like him.
Never known anything like this.

12:08.603 --> 12:12.314
I fell in love with him in 20 minutes!

12:12.524 --> 12:15.234
Well! That was quick.

12:16.653 --> 12:21.448
Dad, I wanted to stop on the way back,
but time got so short...

12:21.658 --> 12:23.700
...and I've got to get to work.

12:23.910 --> 12:28.831
I don't understand why
you couldn't spend one day with us.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.419
Well, fact is, Dad, I met this girl.

12:33.628 --> 12:38.006
You met a girl? Why didn't you say so?
Mary, he's met a girl.

12:38.216 --> 12:41.343
That's good news.
Does she live in San Francisco?

12:41.553 --> 12:43.679
Yes. I'm at her house now.

12:43.888 --> 12:48.725
He's at the girl's house now.
Where did you meet her, Hawaii?

12:48.935 --> 12:52.187
Yes. And I wanted to meet her folks.

12:52.397 --> 12:57.401
- That sounds good, I mean, serious.
- Yes. It's serious.

12:57.610 --> 13:02.364
- This is quite a surprise.
- She's surprising in a lot of ways.

13:02.574 --> 13:07.286
- Your mother says, "Is she pretty?"
- Yes, she's pretty.

13:07.495 --> 13:11.665
Your mother says, "How old is she?"
What's the difference?

13:11.875 --> 13:15.461
- She's only 23, Dad.
- Twenty-three, that's good.

13:15.670 --> 13:20.924
You're 37, that's just right.
Women age faster than men.

13:21.134 --> 13:26.555
- You reckon to marry the girl?
- We've been talking about it, but...

13:27.724 --> 13:31.810
Dad, there's one or two problems,
you see...

13:33.688 --> 13:38.400
...that I'll write to you about
on the plane to New York tonight.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.652
All right?

13:40.904 --> 13:45.324
He's so calm and sure of everything.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.119
He doesn't have any tensions in him.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.331
He knows what he believes
and what he thinks is right...

13:52.540 --> 13:55.709
...and why, and where he's going.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.963
Mom, there's one thing I must tell you.

14:00.173 --> 14:04.092
He was married before,
and he had a son.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.970
It was so tragic.

14:07.180 --> 14:12.226
His wife and son were killed
in a train accident eight years ago.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.896
And John...

14:16.105 --> 14:18.357
I haven't even told you his name.

14:20.485 --> 14:25.906
It's John Wade Prentice.
Isn't that a lovely name?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.367
John Wade...

14:29.577 --> 14:32.204
Joanna Prentice, I'll be.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.542
But, Mom. Mom?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.044
There's something else...

14:39.254 --> 14:42.881
...that John's been very deeply
concerned about.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.760
He's been worrying if
you and Dad would be upset if...

14:48.596 --> 14:52.474
Well, it's about time.
I was wondering where you'd been.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.687
Mom, this is John.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.442
Doc... Doc... Dr. Prentice?

15:03.236 --> 15:06.238
I'm so pleased to meet you.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.783
I'm pleased to meet you, Mrs. Drayton.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.953
Joanna's already
busted out with the news.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.874
She has told me a good deal,
and all very quickly too.

15:19.669 --> 15:24.381
She's only known me for 10 days,
so she can't tell when I'm blushing.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.551
That could be another problem for us.

15:31.222 --> 15:35.058
I'm medically qualified, so I hope
you won't think it presumptuous...

15:35.268 --> 15:38.270
...if I say you should sit
before you fall down.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.149
He thinks you're gonna faint
because he's a Negro.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.734
Well...

15:44.068 --> 15:46.945
I don't think I'm going to faint.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.700
But I'll sit down anyway.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.167
Can't we all sit down?

16:14.432 --> 16:17.059
Well, I...

16:17.268 --> 16:22.564
I suppose it would be all right
if I said, "My goodness," wouldn't it?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.359
Well, my goodness.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.655
- Do we mind her saying "My goodness"?
- I don't mind.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.908
- Did you tell them about me?
- Yes.

16:33.117 --> 16:38.121
They said I sounded serious and asked
if you were pretty. I said yes.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.542
They said this was a big surprise.
I said it was.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.004
Did you tell them I'm not
a colored girl?

16:46.255 --> 16:51.551
I didn't. It was shocking for the phone.
People will think we're shocking.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.639
- Isn't that right, Mrs. Drayton?
- I know what you mean.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.937
- Tillie's made food. Let's go outside.
- Yes, let's.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.982
- Come on, Dr. Prentice.
- I'll explain it in two minutes.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.444
John was lecturing
at Hawaii University.

17:09.654 --> 17:14.407
We met at the dean's party,
and afterward we went for a drive.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.662
Since then, we've been
somewhere together every night.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.583
John was flying back to Los Angeles
on Saturday to see his parents.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.210
That's where they live.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.005
Thank you, Tillie.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.429
Try one of these. They're great.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.848
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.017
- Does your father know you're back?
- Not yet.

17:41.227 --> 17:45.981
- Do you think he'd come back early...?
- Yes, he's playing golf.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.444
Marvelous! He'll meet John
and we can all talk over dinner.

17:50.653 --> 17:55.031
John's flying to New York tonight
to see a friend at Columbia.

17:55.241 --> 17:59.703
Tomorrow he's flying to Geneva
for the World Health Organization.

17:59.912 --> 18:04.040
I'll fly to Geneva next week
so we can be married.

18:04.250 --> 18:08.253
- That's the whole situation.
- In a nutshell.

18:08.463 --> 18:13.842
Except he thinks the fact he's a Negro
and I'm not creates a serious problem.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.302
Does he?

18:15.553 --> 18:19.639
I've told him that it wouldn't
matter to you or Dad.

18:19.849 --> 18:23.018
He won't believe me.
That's why we're here.

18:23.895 --> 18:29.316
That's why he watches you so closely
while pretending not to at all.

18:31.569 --> 18:36.239
She's right. I'm sorry. I told her
not to spring this on you so suddenly.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.036
You can tell your father
you met someone in Hawaii...

18:41.245 --> 18:43.997
- Now, really!
- Give him time to adjust...

18:44.207 --> 18:48.460
But what for?
He still has to be told, doesn't he?

18:49.212 --> 18:54.090
You should make up your minds
because that's his car.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.430
- Mr. Matt?
- Hi, Tillie.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.059
- All hell's done broke loose!
- The waste disposal?

19:04.268 --> 19:06.269
It ain't that.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.690
- What happened? Where's Christina?
- On the terrace with Joey...

19:10.900 --> 19:13.193
...and someone called Dr. Prentice.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.780
Doctor? What's wrong?
What's happened?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.323
Joey?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.035
Here he comes.

19:22.245 --> 19:25.580
- Daddy!
- What's happened?

19:25.790 --> 19:30.293
- Tillie said there was a doctor...
- Dr. John Prentice. This is my dad.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.796
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you?

19:33.005 --> 19:36.424
- Is something wrong?
- I decided to come home early.

19:37.802 --> 19:41.012
We met in Hawaii and flew back today.

19:41.222 --> 19:46.476
Sit down. I thought something
was really wrong. Tillie said...

19:46.686 --> 19:49.813
Tillie's behaving very strangely.
Coffee?

19:50.022 --> 19:53.775
No, thanks. I'm playing golf
with Monsignor Ryan.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.153
How are you? What's the matter?
Are you having a chill?

19:57.363 --> 20:00.532
No, darling. I'm fine, I...

20:00.741 --> 20:04.160
Doctor?
Are you practicing in San Francisco?

20:04.412 --> 20:09.124
- Sit down.
- No, sir. I am just here for one day.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.127
Where is your practice? Hawaii?

20:12.336 --> 20:17.257
No, I'm not established
in any one place.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.927
I'm in tropical medicines,
mostly in Africa.

20:21.137 --> 20:25.557
- That sounds interesting.
- Everything about him is interesting.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.977
I'm sure. I wish I had more time.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.938
- Excuse me...
- Couldn't you stay and talk?

20:32.148 --> 20:37.027
I'd love to, but I'll be late.
I'll see you later, doctor?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.572
- You certainly will.
- Good.

20:40.781 --> 20:45.368
- Dr. Prentice will be here for dinner.
- Fine. Then you can tell me...

20:45.578 --> 20:48.830
And there's a great deal to tell,
isn't there?

20:51.709 --> 20:54.878
Fine. See you all later.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.865
What the hell is going on here?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.077
- This doesn't make sense.
- I told you.

21:27.286 --> 21:32.290
What? If you don't explain
what you three are playing at...

21:32.500 --> 21:35.877
- I can explain it.
- You can? Let's have it.

21:36.087 --> 21:41.508
Well, it's my fault. You see,
we have a sort of a situation here.

21:42.885 --> 21:48.223
We didn't just meet in Hawaii.
We spent a lot of time together.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.768
I mean, all the time after we met.

21:52.019 --> 21:56.272
And, well, we have this problem.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.608
I fell in love with her.

22:03.364 --> 22:07.909
And as incredible as it may seem,
she fell in love with me.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.162
And we flew back to San Francisco...

22:11.372 --> 22:16.209
...to see if either of you had
any objections if we got married.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.466
Joanna told her mother
as soon as she walked in.

22:23.676 --> 22:28.346
I had the stupid idea
that maybe there was some way to...

22:29.390 --> 22:32.642
...break this gently.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.705
- Daddy, you're making us nervous.
- Am I?

22:53.914 --> 22:59.002
I wouldn't want to make anybody
nervous. Chris, are you nervous?

22:59.211 --> 23:02.088
Sit down, doctor,
before you make me nervous.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.927
Would anybody like coffee?

23:08.137 --> 23:13.141
What did she say
when Joanna told her?

23:13.350 --> 23:17.312
- Did she raise any objections?
- None so far.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.230
What objections?

23:19.482 --> 23:23.526
I know this is a shock,
because it's all so unexpected.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.613
I never thought I'd
fall in love with a Negro...

23:26.822 --> 23:30.492
...but I did, and nothing in
the world will change that.

23:30.701 --> 23:36.122
Even if you were the governor
of Alabama, I wouldn't let him go.

23:36.373 --> 23:40.335
I mean, if Mom were.
So tell him, will you?

23:40.544 --> 23:44.798
Tell John if you have objections,
then you can play golf.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.675
What is it you expect me to say?

23:47.885 --> 23:50.762
You have to give me time
to think about this.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.598
You certainly have got a problem.

23:53.808 --> 23:58.311
If you're expecting a sensible
statement, I need time to think.

23:58.521 --> 24:03.191
- Does that sound reasonable?
- Yes, but not quite practical.

24:04.110 --> 24:09.239
You see, Matt, there's sort of
a special problem.

24:09.448 --> 24:14.119
I'm flying to New York tonight,
and on to Switzerland tomorrow.

24:14.328 --> 24:19.082
Yes, and what Joey proposes
is to go to Geneva herself...

24:19.291 --> 24:22.585
...so they can marry
in the next few weeks.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.798
- What the hell's the rush?
- We know we want to get married.

24:27.007 --> 24:30.635
Unless there are objections,
why should we waste time?

24:30.845 --> 24:33.680
John and I aren't
gonna change our minds.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.224
Are you telling me...

24:36.433 --> 24:41.104
...that you want an answer today
about how your mother and I feel?

24:41.313 --> 24:44.357
Yes. We want you and Mom to state...

24:44.567 --> 24:47.193
...that you have no
objections whatever.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.822
And when we do marry,
we'll have your blessing.

25:00.541 --> 25:04.627
- Are you gonna play golf, or no?
- No.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.422
I'll call it off. Excuse me, doctor.

25:13.387 --> 25:18.600
- And that's my dad. Do you like him?
- I don't know. Does he like me?

25:18.809 --> 25:24.022
With his American-eagle face,
no one can tell what he's thinking.

25:24.231 --> 25:28.318
I don't think he liked any of us
after the way we began.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.528
Give John more coffee.

25:30.738 --> 25:35.450
She's beautiful, Joanna.
She's even better-looking than you.

25:35.659 --> 25:40.622
Hello, Edie?
Two things, Edie, both of them urgent.

25:40.831 --> 25:44.500
Call up Monsignor Ryan,
tell him I can't play today.

25:44.710 --> 25:49.005
Tell him something's come up,
something personal at home.

25:49.215 --> 25:53.718
Then call the library and see what
they have on a John Wade Prentice.

25:53.928 --> 25:58.556
Prentice. A doctor of medicine,
fellow of about 35, 36.

25:58.766 --> 26:02.101
- Oh, Matt!
- He's a colored fellow.

26:02.311 --> 26:07.148
If they haven't got anything,
call up the Medical Association.

26:07.358 --> 26:10.985
Get anything you can.
Hurry it up and call me back.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.948
- There's no necessity for that.
- It can't do any harm.

26:15.157 --> 26:19.744
But, Matt! Joey said he was lecturing
at the university in Hawaii.

26:19.954 --> 26:23.039
Did it ever occur to you
that this might happen?

26:25.251 --> 26:26.626
No.

26:26.835 --> 26:30.046
Never occurred to me either. Not once.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.175
Tell me your reaction.
How do you feel?

26:34.385 --> 26:38.513
I don't know. I was shaken at first.
I still am, I suppose.

26:38.722 --> 26:43.268
But they mean what they're saying.
They know what they're doing.

26:43.477 --> 26:48.898
They may mean what they say, but
they don't know what they're doing.

26:52.569 --> 26:56.823
- If I'm not intruding?
- Of course not. Please come in.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.951
I'd like a couple of minutes
with the two of you, if I may.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.870
Sure, doctor. Come on in.

27:05.082 --> 27:09.711
There's something you both
ought to know. I made a decision.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.548
Joanna doesn't know about it,
and she shouldn't.

27:14.425 --> 27:15.925
What is it, doctor?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.971
Joanna thinks that our future
is settled...

27:20.180 --> 27:22.890
...but there is no real commitment.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.644
Up to now, nothing is settled at all.

27:26.854 --> 27:31.274
I don't understand. She said you'd
marry no matter what we think.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.110
That's not the case.

27:34.320 --> 27:38.781
Unless you two approve,
there won't be any marriage.

27:40.617 --> 27:44.954
Why, John?
Why have you decided that?

27:46.457 --> 27:49.459
Mrs. Drayton,
this happened so quickly...

27:49.668 --> 27:52.712
...I'm just as startled
as you must be.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.798
Two weeks ago it'd be inconceivable.

27:57.051 --> 28:01.304
But two weeks ago
I had not met Joanna.

28:02.473 --> 28:06.934
She's not at all
like anyone I've ever known.

28:07.144 --> 28:11.105
It's not just that our color
difference doesn't matter to her.

28:11.315 --> 28:15.693
It's that she doesn't seem to think
there is any difference.

28:18.447 --> 28:23.868
This has come up at a time
when I have all the problems I need.

28:24.078 --> 28:29.332
I can't afford to get married if it
meant taking on special problems...

28:29.541 --> 28:32.085
...in addition to those we'll have.

28:33.921 --> 28:38.174
When you say "special problems,"
doctor, what do you mean?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.051
Well...

28:44.223 --> 28:47.809
Your attitude, Mr. Drayton...

28:48.018 --> 28:50.686
...and yours, Mrs. Drayton.

28:51.313 --> 28:54.107
Joanna is very close to both of you.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.778
If marrying me damaged
her relationship with either of you...

28:58.987 --> 29:01.906
...the pain of it
would be too much for her.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.452
I wouldn't know how to deal
with that kind of situation.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.414
I wouldn't want to try.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.335
I'm glad you told us this.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.675
Don't misunderstand me.
I love your daughter.

29:20.884 --> 29:25.012
I'd do anything to keep her
as happy as the day we met.

29:25.222 --> 29:30.268
But it seems that without your approval
we will make no sense at all.

29:30.477 --> 29:34.105
That is why I am asking
for a clear statement...

29:34.314 --> 29:36.441
...of what your attitude will be.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.612
I appreciate that, doctor.

29:41.822 --> 29:45.199
It's almost in the form
of an ultimatum.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.870
Not quite, Mr. Drayton.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.706
All you have to say is "goodbye. "

29:56.545 --> 29:58.963
Well, that's where it's at.

29:59.173 --> 30:03.509
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak my piece.

30:10.058 --> 30:14.145
Well? Still think you ought
to have someone check on him?

30:14.354 --> 30:18.191
- No.
- He's right about Joey too.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.318
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

30:20.527 --> 30:24.405
Thank God. That's how I feel,
thank God he's right.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.073
She's 23 years old...

30:26.283 --> 30:30.286
...and she is exactly how
we brought her up to be.

30:30.496 --> 30:34.373
We answered her questions.
We told her it was wrong...

30:34.583 --> 30:39.337
...to believe that white people
were superior to black people...

30:39.546 --> 30:42.507
...or brown, or red, or yellow ones.

30:42.716 --> 30:45.343
People thinking that way were wrong...

30:45.552 --> 30:50.598
...sometimes hateful, usually stupid,
but always, always wrong.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.351
That's what we said.

30:53.560 --> 30:57.313
And when we said it, we did not add:

30:57.523 --> 31:01.400
"But don't ever fall in love
with a colored man. "

31:04.863 --> 31:08.991
- Edie, Mr. Drayton.
- What is it, Edie?

31:09.201 --> 31:13.454
He's an important guy.
Born Los Angeles, 1930.

31:13.664 --> 31:16.666
Graduated maximum cum laude
Johns Hopkins, '54.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.502
Assistant professor,
Yale Medical School, '55.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.630
Professor at London School
of Tropical Medicine.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.925
Assistant director,
World Health Organization.

31:26.134 --> 31:30.846
Two textbooks and a long list
of Medical Society honors.

31:31.056 --> 31:35.309
Married Elizabeth Bowers 1955,
one son: John Wade.

31:35.519 --> 31:39.397
Both killed
in an accident in 1959.

31:39.606 --> 31:44.235
- There's a lot more here.
- No, that's all right. Thanks.

31:58.542 --> 32:03.379
- What's the $2.20?
- He called his parents in Los Angeles.

32:03.589 --> 32:07.633
I guess he doesn't bum
free telephone calls either.

32:07.843 --> 32:11.137
I understand why
he didn't talk about himself.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.806
Who the hell would believe him?

32:20.272 --> 32:24.567
- I beg your pardon, lady.
- Loves me, loves me not.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.945
Well, what do you think?

32:28.155 --> 32:31.907
- Aren't they the way I said they were?
- They're special...

32:32.117 --> 32:36.996
Shall I tell you something?
For a whole week, I've been nervous.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.415
No. I don't believe...

32:39.625 --> 32:42.877
Just about their first reaction.

32:43.086 --> 32:47.465
I thought they might let me down
for the first half-hour.

32:47.674 --> 32:51.886
You're a phony, you know that?
You're a big phony!

32:52.346 --> 32:54.847
I'm not a phony.

33:15.786 --> 33:17.870
Well?

33:19.039 --> 33:22.667
She's always been
a happy human being.

33:22.876 --> 33:27.338
She laughed out loud
before she was 6 months old.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.008
She was happy as a baby,
happy as a little girl...

33:31.218 --> 33:34.345
...happy all through school
and college.

33:37.683 --> 33:43.104
But I don't think I've ever seen her
quite so happy as she is right now.

33:44.439 --> 33:49.193
And I have to be happy
for her, Matt...

33:49.403 --> 33:51.278
...and I am.

33:52.280 --> 33:56.992
I feel happy for her.

33:58.245 --> 34:02.081
And proud of the fact
that we helped to make her.

34:02.290 --> 34:07.712
And whatever happens now,
I feel glad that Joey is Joey.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.742
How are you today?
Having a steak fry?

34:37.951 --> 34:41.411
Well, now, there she is.
How are you today?

34:41.621 --> 34:45.833
- Give me a lift to Market Street?
- You know it, doll!

34:46.042 --> 34:48.960
I hope it's better
than the last we had.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.130
I just deliver it,
I don't rustle the cattle.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.301
You said to remind you
to open the wine.

35:26.291 --> 35:30.461
Civil rights is one thing.
This here is something else.

35:30.670 --> 35:35.591
I went out onto the terrace.
Oh, it was so beautiful.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.552
It was dark and the moon was rising.

35:38.762 --> 35:43.098
I didn't see him because of the view,
but he was standing there.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.602
Then, all of a sudden,
he moved, and I jumped.

35:48.438 --> 35:52.441
And he just stood there,
looking at me, and sort of...

35:52.651 --> 35:57.154
- You're burning your shirt.
- Oh, yes. Sort of smiling.

35:57.364 --> 36:00.616
"Hello," I said.
"Who are you?"

36:00.826 --> 36:05.162
And I think he thought I was,
you know, attractive.

36:06.373 --> 36:11.794
Finally he said, "Well, do you think
it could possibly matter?"

36:12.128 --> 36:16.382
- And it's just crazy, and I admit it...
- You'd better let me do this.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.803
But 20 minutes later
I felt I was in love with him.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.765
Mom, how long did it take you
to fall in love with Dad?

36:24.975 --> 36:28.978
Well, nothing so long as 20 minutes!

36:29.187 --> 36:33.524
Is that really true? Oh, Mom!

36:33.733 --> 36:38.362
I wanna ask you something.
How deeply are you and John invol...?

36:38.572 --> 36:40.281
No, I have no right...

36:40.490 --> 36:43.784
Do you mean
have we been to bed together?

36:43.994 --> 36:47.621
I don't mind you asking me that.
We haven't.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.457
He wouldn't.

36:50.667 --> 36:54.628
He couldn't have doubted
my feelings, but he wouldn't.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.630
You're burning my shirt.

36:56.840 --> 37:01.844
He's been concerned the whole time
about my getting hurt somehow.

37:03.305 --> 37:07.933
They're still talking. You'd think
everything was said by now.

37:08.184 --> 37:11.937
You say they don't have
any special sense of rhythm?

37:12.147 --> 37:13.564
That's right.

37:13.773 --> 37:19.111
But you can see it. You can't turn on
the TV without seeing kids dancing.

37:19.321 --> 37:23.866
- The colored kids are better.
- But there's an explanation.

37:24.075 --> 37:28.287
It's our dancing and our music.
We brought it here.

37:28.496 --> 37:32.374
You can do the watusi,
but we are the Watusi...

37:32.584 --> 37:34.376
...if you know what I mean.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.546
When I was your age,
my sports editor told me...

37:37.756 --> 37:41.467
...that Negroes would never
be able to play baseball.

37:41.676 --> 37:46.180
Willie Mays could be elected
mayor of San Francisco.

37:46.389 --> 37:50.434
I own a newspaper, but I couldn't
be elected dogcatcher.

37:50.644 --> 37:55.105
You don't want that any more
than he wants to be mayor.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.983
No, I suppose that's right.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.864
Doctor, we've talked about
a good many things...

38:04.074 --> 38:06.575
...but there's one we haven't.

38:06.785 --> 38:10.287
Have you considered the problems
of your children?

38:10.538 --> 38:13.874
Yes, and they'll have some.

38:14.084 --> 38:18.629
We'll have children,
or you couldn't call it a marriage.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.006
Is that the way Joey feels?

38:22.175 --> 38:25.469
She feels that our every
child will be president...

38:25.679 --> 38:28.847
...and they'll all
have colorful administrations.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.730
Well, you made her, Mr. Drayton.
I just met her in Hawaii.

38:36.940 --> 38:40.859
But how do you feel
about that problem?

38:41.069 --> 38:44.238
Frankly, I think your daughter
is a bit optimistic.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.783
I'd settle for secretary of state.

38:52.122 --> 38:55.708
Would you think it cowardice
if I told you that...

38:55.917 --> 38:59.628
...no matter how confident you are,
I'm scared?

39:00.296 --> 39:02.840
No, it wouldn't.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.427
But you never know.
Things are changing.

39:06.636 --> 39:11.015
They're not changing anywhere
as fast as in my own backyard.

39:11.224 --> 39:15.561
Tell me this. Don't you think
this quick decision...

39:15.770 --> 39:19.606
...about how we feel
is just a little unfair?

39:19.816 --> 39:21.191
In a way, I do.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.491
But it wasn't my idea that
everything be settled so quickly.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.286
Your daughter said there's no problem.

39:32.495 --> 39:37.124
"My dad's a lifelong fighting
liberal who loathes race prejudice...

39:37.333 --> 39:39.460
...and fights discrimination. "

39:39.669 --> 39:43.881
She said, "My parents
will welcome you with open arms. "

39:44.090 --> 39:48.427
And I said,
"Oh, I sure wanna meet them. "

39:50.388 --> 39:53.265
John! Telephone, it's Los Angeles.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.561
- Take it in my study.
- Thank you.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.995
- Hello. Yes, this is he.
- Dr. Prentice?

40:15.205 --> 40:17.414
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

40:17.624 --> 40:21.126
- Dr. Graves call again?
- No, it's not that, son.

40:21.336 --> 40:27.091
I had an idea. What would you say
to us flying there for the evening?

40:27.300 --> 40:30.052
- This evening?
- Could be there at 6:30.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.764
I thought we could
take you both out...

40:33.973 --> 40:36.350
- Invite them to dinner.
- Just a minute.

40:36.559 --> 40:39.228
Dad, I'm having dinner with her folks.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.897
- They're invited!
- That the young lady?

40:42.107 --> 40:46.568
That's her. Just a minute.
You haven't asked your mother...

40:46.778 --> 40:52.032
Mr. Prentice, will you come to dinner?
John and I will meet your plane.

40:52.242 --> 40:55.285
- Who am I talking to? John?
- Hi.

40:55.495 --> 40:59.873
Looks like she wants us, even if you
don't. We certainly wanna meet her.

41:00.083 --> 41:03.418
- So we'll see you at 6:30.
- Oh, no, no.

41:03.628 --> 41:08.507
Your mother says she's pleased.
Hell, he knows that!

41:08.716 --> 41:12.886
- All right, son. We'll see you later.
- Dad? Dad!

41:15.014 --> 41:17.516
What's the matter with you?

41:17.725 --> 41:20.477
- Mom!
- Yeah?

41:20.687 --> 41:23.564
John's parents are coming to dinner.

41:24.941 --> 41:26.316
Good. Marvelous.

41:26.526 --> 41:30.070
- We'll meet their plane at 6:30.
- Fine. Tell Tillie.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.947
Okay.

41:32.157 --> 41:35.993
Joanna, I told you.
My folks, they don't...

41:36.202 --> 41:39.371
- They think you're colored.
- Why didn't you tell them?

41:39.581 --> 41:42.875
- I was gonna write.
- What difference is it?

41:43.084 --> 41:46.003
You think they won't come?
Call and tell them.

41:46.212 --> 41:51.633
- They'll know when I go meet them.
- I'll meet them.

41:51.885 --> 41:57.306
- It gives me a chance to explain...
- Why do you dramatize everything?

41:57.515 --> 42:01.101
We're meeting Peter and Judith
for a drink at 5:30.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.854
There's time to get to the airport.

42:04.063 --> 42:08.233
She's my best friend.
You've just got to let them meet you.

42:11.696 --> 42:15.574
- Did he tell you about his plan?
- No. What?

42:15.783 --> 42:18.493
It's the damnedest thing.

42:18.703 --> 42:24.124
They put a medical school on trucks,
run into some African country...

42:24.667 --> 42:27.711
...pick up the brightest
native kids...

42:27.921 --> 42:31.757
...and give them courses.
Like the U.S. Army Corps.

42:31.966 --> 42:37.221
His idea is that they're all
specialists trained to do one thing.

42:37.430 --> 42:42.684
Like sewing up a wound,
or delivering a baby, what have you.

42:43.144 --> 42:46.813
They go where people never heard
of an aspirin...

42:47.023 --> 42:49.066
...let alone a doctor.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.777
Imagine what that means.

42:51.986 --> 42:57.407
For every 1000 kids they train,
they can save a million lives a year.

42:58.159 --> 43:01.870
He seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

43:02.747 --> 43:07.042
I asked him how he got so far.
He's only 37.

43:07.252 --> 43:10.837
He said he thought
he got the best breaks...

43:11.089 --> 43:15.550
...because no one wanted him
to think they were prejudiced.

43:15.760 --> 43:19.304
Yeah, he made an impression.
I couldn't fault him.

43:19.514 --> 43:22.516
- Are you trying to fault him?
- Of course not.

43:22.767 --> 43:27.229
You know his father's a mailman?
Retired in Los Angeles.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.899
How do you suppose
a colored mailman...

43:31.109 --> 43:34.778
...produced a son
with all the qualities he has?

43:34.988 --> 43:37.739
- You'll find out this evening.
- What?

43:39.742 --> 43:43.161
- Guess who's coming to dinner.
- Who?

43:43.371 --> 43:45.247
You mean... His parents?

43:47.375 --> 43:49.084
Now, wait a minute.

43:49.627 --> 43:53.380
- Whose idea was that?
- Joey invited them.

43:53.589 --> 43:57.301
We're being pressurized.
You know that, don't you?

43:57.510 --> 44:01.054
First there was no marriage
unless we approved.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.807
Then we had one day to decide.

44:04.017 --> 44:09.271
Now we're entertaining somebody
we've never heard of! What the hell...?

44:13.818 --> 44:19.239
Don't look at my baby pictures.
That's at Klosters the year...

44:19.449 --> 44:22.034
I'll get it, Tillie. Just a second.

44:26.414 --> 44:31.168
- Monsignor Ryan, how wonderful!
- Good afternoon.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.920
But why are you here, not in Hawaii?

44:34.130 --> 44:38.175
What problem caused your father
to chicken out of golf?

44:38.384 --> 44:42.721
- And who is this gentleman?
- This is Dr. John Wade Prentice.

44:42.930 --> 44:46.058
We met in Hawaii
and we're gonna be married.

44:46.267 --> 44:50.270
Are you indeed?
I take it you mean to each other?

44:50.480 --> 44:52.230
- Dr. Prentice.
- Monsignor.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.816
- Of course, you're the problem.
- Yes.

44:55.026 --> 44:57.402
I'm afraid I am.

44:57.612 --> 45:00.489
Why haven't your parents
informed me?

45:00.698 --> 45:02.908
They didn't know either.

45:03.117 --> 45:07.954
Excuse me a second,
I forgot to tell Tillie something.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.668
- I suppose this was all very sudden?
- Yes.

45:13.878 --> 45:18.840
- Have you two had time to consider it?
- No, we've not.

45:19.759 --> 45:21.593
We'll be two more for dinner.

45:21.803 --> 45:25.305
- How many steaks?
- I got four. I was told four.

45:25.515 --> 45:29.267
Order two more because
the doctor's parents are coming.

45:29.477 --> 45:33.271
- His father and mother, here?
- That's right.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.691
If the butcher can't send them,
send a taxi.

45:36.901 --> 45:40.570
It's more like a Holy Rollers'
meeting every minute.

45:40.780 --> 45:46.284
Of course! I know about you. I read
an article about you in Commonweal.

45:46.494 --> 45:49.287
I shall want to talk
to you about that.

45:49.497 --> 45:53.417
Are you aware this fellow's
a very important man?

45:53.626 --> 45:57.712
Wholly aware of it.
When we're married, I'll be important.

45:57.922 --> 46:01.007
I daresay you will,
as a matter of fact.

46:01.217 --> 46:04.136
- Where's Arnold Palmer?
- In the garden.

46:04.345 --> 46:07.681
Just go on with what you're doing.
Fore!

46:08.933 --> 46:11.685
Of all our friends, he's the closest.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.437
We're not Catholics...

46:13.646 --> 46:18.066
...but he and Dad and Mom
sat on committees and things.

46:18.693 --> 46:21.820
He's a wonderful man, and we love him.

46:23.865 --> 46:28.201
You're a remarkable fellow, Mike.
You get younger every minute.

46:28.411 --> 46:31.663
- Did you?
- Yes! I've just seen him.

46:31.873 --> 46:35.750
Handsome fellow.
Little Joey's nothing less than radiant.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.004
It warms me chilly old heart
looking at her.

46:39.213 --> 46:44.593
- Aren't you a little shocked?
- Shocked? Why should I be shocked?

46:44.802 --> 46:48.722
I've known many cases
of marriages between races.

46:48.931 --> 46:53.602
Strangely enough, they usually
work out well. I don't know why.

46:53.811 --> 46:57.397
Maybe because it takes
a special quality of effort.

46:57.607 --> 46:59.649
More consideration, compassion...

46:59.859 --> 47:03.695
...than most marriages
generate these days.

47:03.905 --> 47:07.699
- Could that be it?
- Yes, it could.

47:07.909 --> 47:09.409
I'm glad you said that.

47:09.827 --> 47:14.247
That's a beautiful thought.
You do have beautiful thoughts.

47:14.457 --> 47:17.250
It's my trade, you know.

47:18.294 --> 47:23.298
What about laddie over here?
You making heavy weather of it?

47:23.508 --> 47:27.010
You know, this man is quite
a famous fellow.

47:27.220 --> 47:31.640
He's done incredible work in Asia
and some awful place in Africa.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.893
Mom! Hilary's here.
She wants to see you.

47:36.729 --> 47:41.483
Excuse me. Express some more
beautiful thoughts to the lad.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.114
Thank you.

47:48.324 --> 47:53.745
I hope you won't think I'm prying,
but, naturally, one is curious.

47:53.955 --> 47:54.996
Naturally.

47:55.206 --> 47:59.042
Dr. Prentice and I
are gonna be married, Hilary.

47:59.252 --> 48:01.294
Are you?

48:01.504 --> 48:05.257
I didn't even know.
Christina hadn't even mentioned it.

48:05.466 --> 48:09.427
- She didn't know. It was a surprise.
- A surprise?

48:09.637 --> 48:12.013
Well, I should think it was!

48:12.223 --> 48:17.477
Joey tells me congratulations
are in order. You didn't even know.

48:25.570 --> 48:29.656
What's the problem, Hilary?
What brings you up here?

48:29.865 --> 48:32.784
Mr. Cazelet phoned about the...

48:32.994 --> 48:37.622
Oh, that. Excuse us, will you?
I'll walk out to your car with you.

48:37.873 --> 48:40.083
I hope I'll see you shortly.

48:40.293 --> 48:45.338
Dr. Prentice is leaving tonight,
and Joey within the next two weeks.

48:45.548 --> 48:49.217
Then you must permit me
to wish you every happiness.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.511
Come along, Hilary.

48:55.558 --> 48:59.436
Christina! My poor dear,
what a shock for you.

48:59.645 --> 49:04.357
I knew something was up, but this?
What are you going to do?

49:04.567 --> 49:07.485
- The child is of age...
- Yes, the child is 23.

49:07.695 --> 49:11.990
Why didn't you simply ring up
with the Cazelet information?

49:12.199 --> 49:14.868
I must admit, I was intensely curious.

49:15.077 --> 49:20.081
I couldn't believe it. It's unlike
Joey to do anything so stupid.

49:20.291 --> 49:23.418
- Come along.
- What you must be going through!

49:23.628 --> 49:25.962
You must try not to worry about it.

49:26.922 --> 49:32.052
I have some instructions. Go back
to the gallery. Start your motor.

49:32.261 --> 49:36.014
Tell Jennifer she'll
look after things temporarily.

49:36.223 --> 49:39.267
She's to call if there's
anything she needs.

49:39.477 --> 49:46.107
Then go into the office and make out
a check for the sum of $5000.

49:46.317 --> 49:50.987
Then carefully, Hilary,
remove absolutely everything...

49:51.197 --> 49:54.449
...that might remind me
you were ever there...

49:54.659 --> 49:58.953
...including the yellow thing
with blue bulbs you like.

49:59.163 --> 50:03.500
Then take the check for $5000,
which I feel you deserve...

50:03.709 --> 50:07.545
...and get permanently lost.

50:07.755 --> 50:10.423
It's not that I don't
want to know you...

50:10.633 --> 50:14.135
...it's just that we're not
the sort of people...

50:14.345 --> 50:17.013
...that you can afford
to associate with.

50:17.223 --> 50:20.600
Don't speak, Hilary, just go.

50:25.940 --> 50:31.069
You see that boy? If he'd played his
cards right, you'd never met me.

50:31.278 --> 50:35.448
- He fell for some girl from Pomona.
- That'll teach him.

50:35.658 --> 50:40.286
You know what Hilary was doing?
She was being an absolute bitch!

50:40.496 --> 50:43.081
I wish you'd fire her, I really do.

50:43.290 --> 50:46.668
Joey! How can you be so hard?

50:46.877 --> 50:50.463
She has a ruthless streak, John.
Be warned about it.

50:50.673 --> 50:53.675
She gets it from her father.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.469
They need all the help
you can give them.

50:56.721 --> 51:00.014
They're gonna have
special difficulties...

51:00.224 --> 51:02.976
- Christina.
- Don't budge, please. Sit.

51:03.185 --> 51:08.481
Of course, they know all that.
They're serious, intelligent people.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.734
If they know what lies in store...

51:10.943 --> 51:14.112
...and want each other
enough to accept it...

51:14.321 --> 51:17.198
...then they love each other
very much.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.410
Any two people
who love each other that much...

51:20.619 --> 51:24.080
...deserve all the best luck
in the world.

51:24.290 --> 51:28.460
I don't know. I have the feeling
that they'll never make it.

51:28.669 --> 51:31.504
That the whole thing's impossible.

51:32.923 --> 51:36.176
You feel that way, do you?

51:36.385 --> 51:39.429
You're really thrashing about, then.

51:39.638 --> 51:43.725
That's very interesting, indeed.
And rather amusing too...

51:43.934 --> 51:48.938
...to see a broken-down phony liberal
facing his principles.

51:50.024 --> 51:54.277
I always believed that under
the fighting liberal faÃ§ade...

51:54.487 --> 51:58.406
...there must be a reactionary bigot
trying to get out.

51:58.616 --> 52:03.745
Oh, go to hell. You and your crowd
are still preaching hell.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.122
Well, I'm off.

52:06.749 --> 52:12.170
As much as I enjoy your discomfort,
I can save a few souls before supper.

52:12.379 --> 52:17.133
But I am, as it happens,
free for dinner...

52:17.343 --> 52:22.764
Please come, 7.30. The doctor's
family are flying up from Los Angeles.

52:23.015 --> 52:27.519
Well, in that case,
you'll actually need me.

52:27.728 --> 52:31.648
Otherwise, you won't even
outnumber the blacks.

52:31.857 --> 52:35.109
Thank you, my dear.

52:35.319 --> 52:37.654
Half past 7.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.156
What was that the Beatles sang?

52:51.168 --> 52:55.713
- Mom did it. Does it look like him?
- He looks a little grim...

52:55.923 --> 52:59.717
- Hey!
- No, no. Don't let me disturb you.

52:59.927 --> 53:03.680
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm coming to dinner.

53:03.889 --> 53:06.683
- I'm delighted you're coming.
- Thank you.

53:06.892 --> 53:11.896
I'm very delighted to have met you.
See you this evening.

53:12.106 --> 53:14.858
You know, you two make me feel...

53:15.067 --> 53:18.695
...quite extraordinarily happy.

53:23.117 --> 53:28.454
I'd better tell Tillie. Listen, you'll
hear her going through the roof.

53:32.918 --> 53:37.839
I've brought you the latest bulletin.
Guess who's coming to dinner now.

53:38.048 --> 53:42.051
- The Reverend Martin Luther King?
- Oh, Tillie.

53:42.261 --> 53:44.429
You're so close. Monsignor Ryan.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.932
Bake a second pie.
He loves your cooking.

53:48.142 --> 53:53.062
Is the big guest room in order?
Dr. Prentice wants to have a shower.

53:53.856 --> 53:57.692
- He does?
- He does.

54:00.654 --> 54:04.157
She's 23. She has the right
to do as she pleases.

54:04.366 --> 54:08.494
- That's not the point. He said...
- I know what he said.

54:08.746 --> 54:13.041
Could we go for a few minutes?
What are the others doing?

54:13.250 --> 54:17.170
Meeting Peter and Judith,
then going to the airport.

54:17.379 --> 54:18.838
Come on!

54:19.048 --> 54:22.258
Well, come on, will you?!

54:35.189 --> 54:40.485
What happened to Homer, that lawyer?
I thought she liked him a lot.

54:40.694 --> 54:44.197
Nothing happened.
Dr. Prentice happened to Joey.

54:44.406 --> 54:48.368
Only last Christmas she said
Homer had the inside track.

54:50.496 --> 54:54.207
That's where we got the ice cream.
Let's get some.

54:54.416 --> 54:58.586
- Oh, Matt, it's after 5!
- A little ice cream can't hurt!

55:17.439 --> 55:18.648
Yes?

55:18.857 --> 55:24.237
When I had ice cream before, I had
a special flavor I liked very much.

55:24.446 --> 55:27.156
- I can't remember.
- I'll bring the list.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.409
You must know what it is.

55:29.618 --> 55:32.829
Daiquiri ice, honeycomb candy,
cocoa-coconut...

55:33.038 --> 55:36.332
...mocha jamoca, peanut butter,
banana mint?

55:36.542 --> 55:40.461
- Must've been another place.
- Fresh Oregon boysenberry.

55:40.671 --> 55:42.422
That's it. That's it.

55:42.631 --> 55:48.052
That's it. Fresh Oregon boysenberry.
Bring me a big one, huh?

55:48.262 --> 55:50.888
- Will you have some?
- No, black coffee.

55:51.098 --> 55:55.977
One double fresh Oregon boysenberry
and one black coffee. Thank you.

56:01.608 --> 56:04.318
You know, Matt...

56:04.528 --> 56:08.197
...I think Mike was right,
that Joey is lucky.

56:08.407 --> 56:12.076
The work he does is so important.
She'll be able...

56:12.286 --> 56:16.289
...to share it all with him.
It's the best break.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.709
For us it's all been great.

56:19.918 --> 56:23.671
But do you know what was
the best time of all?

56:23.881 --> 56:25.923
The beginning, when we struggled.

56:26.133 --> 56:30.678
You were working too hard and
worried, sometimes frightened.

56:30.888 --> 56:35.808
And there were times when I felt,
when I really knew...

56:36.018 --> 56:37.977
...that I was a help to you.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.980
That was the very best time
of all for me.

56:43.734 --> 56:47.904
- Okay. One black coffee.
- Thank you.

56:48.113 --> 56:52.450
- And one Oregon boysenberry sherbet.
- Thank you.

57:04.505 --> 57:08.591
This is not the stuff.
I never had this before.

57:17.309 --> 57:21.229
You know, it's not bad at all.
I kind of like it.

57:21.438 --> 57:24.607
Fresh Oregon boysenberry.

57:24.817 --> 57:26.150
Yes, sir?

57:26.360 --> 57:30.279
When I had ice cream before,
this isn't the stuff I had.

57:30.489 --> 57:33.282
But I like it, it's very good.
I like it very much.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.159
Okay.

57:45.212 --> 57:48.673
- How do you do, Miss Binks?
- I got something to say!

57:48.882 --> 57:52.426
Just exactly what
are you trying to pull here?

57:52.636 --> 57:56.222
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I was finding me a wife.

57:56.431 --> 57:58.432
Ain't that just likely?

57:58.642 --> 58:02.728
What kind of doctor are you
supposed to be?

58:02.938 --> 58:05.022
Would you believe horse?

58:06.441 --> 58:09.402
You make with witticisms and all, huh?

58:09.611 --> 58:14.574
You may think you're fooling these
folks, but you ain't fooling me.

58:14.783 --> 58:20.496
You're a smooth-talking, smart-ass
niggers out for all you can get...

58:20.747 --> 58:24.250
...with all that other
trouble-making nonsense.

58:24.459 --> 58:29.172
I brought up that child,
and ain't nobody gonna harm her.

58:29.381 --> 58:33.759
As long as you're here,
I'm watching. You read me, boy?

58:33.969 --> 58:38.222
You bring trouble, you'll know
what "black power" means!

58:38.432 --> 58:42.768
And furthermore, you ain't even
all that good-looking!

58:50.569 --> 58:55.990
That was good. If I come again,
remind me about the boysenberry.

58:56.783 --> 58:59.702
Yeah, I sure will. Thank you, sir.

59:02.623 --> 59:07.543
- Shall we take some home for dessert?
- No. Tillie's baked pies.

59:17.846 --> 59:20.264
You stupid idiot!

59:22.142 --> 59:27.104
- Can't you look where you're going?
- Your car's so low, I couldn't see it.

59:27.314 --> 59:31.359
Of course you didn't see me!
You weren't looking!

59:31.568 --> 59:35.613
- Look what you did!
- Okay, it's my fault. My insurance...

59:35.822 --> 59:40.409
Who cares about your insurance?
I worked three months on that!

59:40.619 --> 59:46.040
- How much to have it repaired?
- Look at it! Thirty or 40 bucks.

59:46.375 --> 59:50.670
Stupid old man! You ought to be
put away in a home.

59:50.879 --> 59:54.715
There's 50. Don't bother
to have it fixed. Buy a new one!

59:56.093 --> 59:59.095
Some of these old guys,
they're senile!

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.639
Stupid old man!

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.852
There ought to be a law!
There ought to be a law!

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:16.988
What the hell is it today?

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:20.533
Less than 12 percent of this city
are colored.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:26.122
I can't even have a dish of Oregon
boozenberry without running into one!

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.333
I can't tell you how happy
I am for you.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.085
It all happened so quickly.

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:17.298
It took Peter and me three years
to get married.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.300
We lived together for two.

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:26.098
- To John and Joey.
- John and Joanna.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:31.354
- He only calls me Joanna. I like it.
- To John and Joanna.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:36.776
You know, where you're so lucky
is in Joey's folks.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:42.073
Matt Drayton really
stands for something in this town.

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:47.495
- It's always been a good paper.
- And he made it that way.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:51.999
Matt takes a stand on all
public issues.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:56.921
- When are you flying over?
- As soon as I can arrange everything.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:00.674
Why aren't you flying over with John?

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.135
Why am I not flying over with you?

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:07.807
- Why am I not flying with you?
- Is your passport in order?

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:10.684
- Need anything?
- I could get it there.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:15.564
Then it seems crazy to go all that way
when you could go together.

01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:19.443
- Why don't you both leave tonight?
- Why not?

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:20.778
Yes.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:39.296
It's 6:00. In an hour they'll be here.
The doctor leaves at 10:45.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:44.343
No matter what it is, you
have to tell them how you feel.

01:02:45.137 --> 01:02:48.264
I need more than one day
to make a decision like that.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:51.976
It's the silliest thing.
But I'll say this:

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:56.856
I won't try to pretend
that I'm happy about it. I'm not.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:03:01.235
If the doctor's decision depends
on that, then it's too bad.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.863
I'm thinking only of Joey's welfare.

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:07.450
I have nothing against him,
but he's a grown man...

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:11.537
...and he behaved irresponsibly
by letting it happen.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.498
Now he wants me
to approve a situation...

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:18.252
...when I know they'll
get their brains knocked out!

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:23.299
Sorry, that's the way I feel.
And I know how you're reacting.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:26.594
You're so wrapped up
in Joey's excitement...

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:30.556
...that you are not behaving
in her best interest.

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:07.236
There's no reason not to go tonight.
You can understand, can't you, Mom?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:13.075
My passport's in order, I don't need
anything. I can pack in an hour.

01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:17.580
I'll be with him.
We'll be together the whole time.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:21.458
Mom, they're here. I can see them.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:25.546
They look like awfully nice people.
His mother looks lovely.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.090
Break it to Dad for me, will you?

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:31.260
Well...

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:36.890
I should've called you back again,
because there is one thing I...

01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:43.147
I've been meaning to write to you.
There's one thing I didn't explain.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:47.943
And I'm afraid it's gonna
be kind of a shock.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.953
If you see what I mean.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:01.498
Mom, Dad, this is Joanna Drayton.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.751
Joanna, my mom, my dad.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.879
Mrs. Prentice, I'm so happy.

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:09.965
- Miss Drayton?
- Drayton, yes.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.636
Mr. Prentice,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.434
I can explain.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:24.605
I can imagine
what's going on in your mind...

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:28.233
...but we can explain.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.030
- You can?
- Of course we can.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:35.616
You have bags?

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:39.536
Of course you have bags.
Let's go get your bags.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.039
Mama.

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:47.795
- What did your folks say?
- All's well.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:51.799
- Did you talk with your father?
- To Mom, but she'll tell him.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:56.345
- Tonight?
- I thought I ought to tell you.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.807
This whole thing...
That's out of the question.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:05.354
I couldn't do what you're doing, so
I don't understand how you'll do it.

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:09.942
You can't break their hearts
and then sit down to dinner.

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.653
Don't you think I know that?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:18.283
I'll talk to the doctor after dinner.
Tell him exactly how I feel.

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:21.245
Matt, I'm not trying to argue.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:24.498
There's nothing to say
that you don't know.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.043
But it's important how wrong
I think you...

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.504
You're making the worst mistake...

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:35.134
I think you'll regret it
for as long as you live.

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:38.137
You're as wrong as you can be.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:42.641
I'm thinking of her.
Even the doctor's gonna know that.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:47.896
There's something else. I'm
surprised it hasn't occurred to you.

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:52.484
The doctor will accept it
because he's sensitive...

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:54.862
...and because he said he would.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:59.908
But Joey won't. Your mistake is in
underestimating your daughter.

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:05.372
She'll fight you and every argument
you ever try to give her.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.083
And one thing more.

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:12.963
Until today I'd never have believed
I could say such a thing.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:17.050
But when she fights you,
and for what it's worth...

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.220
...I'm going to be on her side.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:28.812
I never would've believed
I'd hear you say a thing like that.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.606
Damn it.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:35.359
- Can I get you another drink?
- No, thanks. I'll get it.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:44.411
I wish we had more time...

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:47.331
What were you gonna say?

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:52.127
I was gonna ask Miss Drayton
how her parents reacted to...

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:55.881
- I wanted to ask that too.
- Please call me Joanna.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:59.176
They were shaken. I don't think
I've seen them so surprised.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:04.139
What really shook them was
that I wanted to marry anybody.

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:07.267
I can't blame them for being stunned.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:12.397
Then you couldn't blame us
if we were a little stunned too.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.609
It's not unreasonable
to suggest that...

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:19.321
...you two are behaving like
escaped lunatics.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:21.573
Dad...

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:27.203
...this happened so quickly.
It's like riding a rocket.

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:30.832
We didn't plan it,
it just happened that way.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:35.002
It's hard on Joanna's folks,
and it'll be hard on you.

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:41.301
If you have any objections,
you'd better raise them soon...

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.680
...because in exactly four hours
we'll be gone.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:50.352
I can't list all my objections
in four hours. I'd need eight hours.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:56.316
You've only got four hours, so you'll
just have to talk twice as fast.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:15.168
- Christina!
- Hello, darling. How are you?

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:20.340
- Forgive me. I'm a little bit early.
- Come in.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.219
I don't like to be
always repeating myself...

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:26.889
...but how long since I remarked...

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:30.601
...that you are the loveliest woman
I've ever known?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:34.646
There is a kind of envy
that is in no way sinful.

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:37.316
That's what I've had for Matt.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:41.945
- What can I get you to drink?
- I like Scotch.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:45.657
- But aren't we drinking wine?
- Yes.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:51.246
I'll have a drop of Scotch anyhow.
Equal amount of soda, please.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.837
Thank you.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:04.384
My dear, what's the matter?

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:13.310
We're in trouble, Mike.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:17.064
We're in terrible trouble,
terrible trouble.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.234
John told Matt and me
that he wouldn't marry Joey...

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:25.614
...unless we'd approve
with no reservations whatever.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:28.158
Joey doesn't know he said that.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.286
Now she's decided to go
with him tonight.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:35.123
They're on their way
with John's parents.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.836
Neither of them knows
that Matt has decided...

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.965
Matt has decided that
he can't approve.

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:47.427
That's not true.
Please tell me it's not true.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.723
- Where is Matt?
- He's upstairs, changing. He's...

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.518
He's not himself, Mike.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.563
Excuse me.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.900
It's incredible!

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:15.539
- Table all right?
- It's fine, Tillie. Thank you.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:19.001
Miss Christina,
what's gonna happen here?

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.795
I don't know, Tillie.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:27.384
You and Mr. Matt gonna put a stop
to this damn nonsense foolishness?

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.804
Tillie, I don't want
to put a stop to anything.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:34.099
He's a fine man.
He's a wonderful man.

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:37.019
And Joey is
very much in love with him.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:40.522
And it isn't just
"damn nonsense foolishness. "

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:43.817
I tell you, the way you're talking...

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.987
...I don't understand nothing no more.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:53.785
Nobody understands nothing no more.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:58.665
No, I don't think you're butting
in about what doesn't concern...

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.001
Damn, blast!

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:05.964
I understand how you feel, Mike.
I understand how everybody feels.

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:11.053
But understand, they've boxed me
into a hell of a corner here.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:16.016
And no matter what anyone says,
I won't behave irresponsibly.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.936
I'm not gonna tell them
they can't get married.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:24.649
But they have no right to expect me
to be happy when...

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.984
For God's sake!

01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:30.197
You're about to destroy
all the happiness there is...

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:33.325
...in the happiest family
I've ever known.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:37.454
- Have you any thought for Christina?
- Christina?

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:41.083
Have you any idea
of how she has behaved today?

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:45.378
She was all for it as though
there were no problems.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:49.633
But there are no problems
they don't know about.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:53.386
Christina respects Joey's judgment
more than you.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:58.433
Come off it! If Joey came home
with some fuzzy-wuzzy and said:

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:03.480
"Mom, this is the man for me,"
Christina would say, "How wonderful!

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.733
Where will we get enough roses
to fill the Rose Bowl?"

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:10.487
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen you so angry.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:13.824
When you took nine shots
on the 7th green.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:20.122
- Could you get the hell out of here?
- I know why you're angry.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:25.752
Not with the doctor, not with
Joey or Christina, not even with me.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:30.257
- You're angry with yourself.
- You pontificating old poop!

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.845
You're angry because
suddenly you've been thrown.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:38.473
You're the last man
I'd expect to behave this way.

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:43.895
You're not yourself! You don't know
who you are, or what you're doing.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:49.151
That's your trouble. You've gone back
on yourself. In your heart, you know it.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.445
I'll only take so much,
even from you!

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:57.325
For 30 years, there's been no man
I've admired or respected more.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.619
You know that, Matt.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:05.083
And for the first time in all those
30 years, I feel sorry for you.

01:15:05.293 --> 01:15:07.294
Damn it, that's enough!

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:11.089
Are you really capable of putting
yourself in my position?

01:15:11.299 --> 01:15:15.427
Unless you've got kids
of your own somewhere...

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:19.681
...how could you know how a father
feels in this situation?

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:24.311
You don't know! I know
they won't have a dog's chance...

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.606
...not here, not in the whole
stinking world!

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:32.319
They are this country.
They'll change this stinking world.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:35.363
In 50 years, maybe, or 100 years...

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:38.408
...but not in your lifetime.
Maybe not even in mine.

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:44.039
My dear friend, I wish with all my
heart you could be restrained.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:48.627
If I were younger, to prevent you
from going downstairs...

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:52.297
...I'd make an effort
to wrestle you to the floor.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:55.550
That'll be the day.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:01.973
Is that the car? Did you hear a car?

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:09.814
- Mrs. Prentice. I'm Christina Drayton.
- How do you do?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:13.652
How do you do?
I'm so pleased to meet you.

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:18.073
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours, Mrs. Prentice?

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:21.993
How good of you to come
all this long way. Do go in.

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:26.039
- Did you tell him? Was he shaken?
- It was a surprise.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:30.085
- Does he wanna talk to me?
- I'm sure he does, later.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:31.836
Please come in.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.966
- May I get you a drink?
- May I have some sherry, please?

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:40.387
- What a lovely room.
- John, would you be bartender?

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.722
Shall we sit over here?

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.934
- What will you have, Dad? Bourbon?
- Thank you.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:50.981
- You have such a magnificent view.
- Thank you. Please sit down.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.692
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:02.617
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very pleasant, thank you.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:06.204
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:09.207
Only took 40 minutes.
Four hundred miles.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.960
It's incredible, isn't it?

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:20.010
My husband will be down directly,
I think. He's upstairs changing.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:24.681
And we have a friend coming to dinner,
Monsignor Ryan.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:30.103
- They'll be down in a minute.
- Mrs. Prentice. Mom.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:32.772
- Here you are, Dad.
- Thanks, son.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:37.944
Are you Catholics, Mrs. Drayton?

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:42.282
No, we're not, Mr. Prentice.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:47.412
We're nothing in particular.
Monsignor Ryan is an old friend.

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:51.082
Do you come often to San Francisco?

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:55.295
- I've got to talk to your father.
- There he is.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.050
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:04.012
- This is my father.
- Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:08.767
Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.
May I present Monsignor Ryan?

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:12.771
- How do you do?
- Glad to meet you, sir.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.856
- Are you tending bar?
- Yes.

01:18:15.066 --> 01:18:18.443
- We're both drinking Scotch.
- Coming up.

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:22.781
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, there, Mike.

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:31.331
- Did you have a nice flight?
- Very nice flight.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.500
Only 40 minutes.

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.171
- Only 40 minutes from L.A.
- Terrifying.

01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:41.841
You could talk
about flying to Geneva...

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:46.012
...because John and I hope
you'll come for the wedding.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:49.724
Would anybody like to talk about that?

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:55.772
I take it they've told you
all about their plans.

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:59.359
Of course. It's only when you're
eloping that you keep it a secret.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:02.404
I don't know about you, Mr. Prentice...

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:05.365
...but I think they're rushing it a bit.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:08.743
It seemed that way to me too.

01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:13.665
- It seems like that to you too?
- That's right.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:17.127
I'm certainly relieved to hear that.

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:20.171
I was beginning to think
I was the only one...

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:23.550
I would like Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:26.052
What are you talking about?
What view?

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.263
From the terrace.

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:31.683
- Would you care to see the view?
- Yes, thank you.

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:35.478
Good. Excuse us.
Bring your drink, that's fine.

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:47.073
Mrs. Prentice, have you had any
chance to speak privately with John?

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.409
Well, no.

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.579
It's important you know
what's happened...

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:55.957
...and what I'm terribly
afraid will happen.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:20:00.712
May I explain the situation
to you, or try to?

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:04.841
- Yes, please. I wish you would.
- First I have to ask you...

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.261
Forgive my being so abrupt
and so direct.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:11.222
Are you shocked by the fact...

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:15.268
...that John's involved
with a white girl?

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:17.312
Yes, surprised.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:20.607
It never happened before.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:25.195
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:28.656
But it wouldn't be true
to say that I'm shocked.

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:31.826
Are you, Mrs. Drayton?

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:37.290
Well, I think I was at first,
this afternoon...

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.460
...because it came as a surprise
to us too.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.671
But now I know how
they feel about each other.

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:48.259
Joey's very young, Mrs. Prentice,
but she's not a child.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:54.265
And they're deeply
in love with each other.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:02.815
Are you telling me that you'd
approve the marriage...

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:07.111
...but that your husband won't?
Is that it?

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:10.448
Yes, that's it.

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:12.992
My husband won't, either.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:20.124
I wish there were more time,
just to adjust to the situation...

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:24.546
...but there just isn't any time.

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:28.341
If we're going to accept it...

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:31.678
...we'll have to trust the two of them...

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.056
...and accept that
they know what they're doing.

01:21:35.266 --> 01:21:40.311
Mrs. Drayton,
my husband just won't do that.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:49.946
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:54.075
It might do no harm
if we had a few words, Mr. Drayton.

01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:55.326
Yes, sure.

01:21:55.578 --> 01:22:00.248
We can go into my study.
Will you excuse us, please?

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:07.839
Doc, you'll excuse us, please?

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:14.929
I'll have another drink, if you will.

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:17.974
- Another?
- No.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:23.229
If you'll excuse me, I'll go up
and throw a few things together...

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.982
...like for the next 10 years.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.034
Mr. Drayton...

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:41.664
...I don't know you,
and wouldn't wanna offend you...

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:47.086
...but are you nuts? Are you telling
me that you approve of this?

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.839
I wasn't going to tell you that.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:54.052
Because you may be
a big newspaper publisher...

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:58.723
...and I'm a pensioned-off mailman,
but you are out of your mind!

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:11.903
I have a good idea of what
my father is saying to him.

01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.529
I wish I knew.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.700
You were talking with him upstairs.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:21.954
Have you any idea what Mr. Drayton
is saying to my father?

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.248
I can tell you one thing.

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:28.252
I was sorry to hear that you
intend to withdraw...

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:32.090
...if you encounter any opposition.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:49.190
She's up there packing.

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:54.195
John, your mother
would like to speak to you.

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:03.079
- This is a mess. Where's Joey?
- Upstairs.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.289
I'm going up.

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:10.128
- Everything is ready when you are.
- We're not ready, Tillie.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:16.843
Well, what you're saying is you feel
practically the same as I do.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:22.473
That's right. But even so, this is a hell
of an unhappy situation...

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:26.269
...for both your son and my daughter.

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:30.481
I think it'd be best if you
talked to John yourself.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:45.496
I said that if they didn't approve,
there'd be no marriage.

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:52.003
- I set the terms, Mama.
- They don't disapprove.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:57.049
- Only Mr. Drayton.
- Are you sure?

01:24:57.259 --> 01:25:01.429
She said she'd even
drive you to the airport.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:09.145
John, I've lived with your father
for almost 40 years.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.773
God willing, there'd be more.

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:19.447
And even though I've only known
about this situation for one hour...

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:23.618
...I feel the same way
Mrs. Drayton does.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:27.705
She says Joanna
will never give you up.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:34.045
I guess it depends upon
how much you want her.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.589
Want her?

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.385
I want her, Mama.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:47.016
You know what it's been like for me
these past eight years?

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:49.894
I felt like I never
wanted anybody again.

01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:53.940
But, Mama...

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:57.068
...these last few days with her...

01:25:57.319 --> 01:26:01.614
...it's like I'm alive again.
It's love.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.617
Excuse me, doctor.

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:11.499
- Your father wants to talk to you.
- Does he?

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.501
He's in my study.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:38.067
I've been talking to your husband.
He seems upset by all this.

01:26:38.277 --> 01:26:42.655
I know. Your wife says
you are too, Mr. Drayton.

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:46.534
Not upset, exactly.
It's a very difficult problem.

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:52.164
For whom? For you and my husband?

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:55.501
I think you'll solve your problem.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:27:00.047
All you have to do is tell them
you're against them. That's all.

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:03.217
And you'll have no problem.

01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:07.972
You're not telling me
you're happy about this?

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:12.768
This is not a night for talking
about happiness.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:15.021
This is an unhappy night.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:20.026
You talked to Christina.
I know how she feels.

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:24.572
Can you imagine for one minute
that I want to see them hurt?

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:29.660
No. No more than my husband does.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:34.165
But hurt they're going to be...

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:38.586
...worse than my husband knows.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:41.839
I think worse than you know too.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:48.012
He's as much against this
as I am, maybe more.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:53.100
Son, you've got to listen. I'm not
telling you how to live your life...

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.270
...but you never made
a mistake like this.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.524
You've been a source
of pride for me and your mother.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.818
But you don't know what you're doing!

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:07.156
This affair happened too fast,
you said so yourself.

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:12.453
You've got to stop and think!
Have you thought what people will say?

01:28:12.663 --> 01:28:16.332
In 16 or 17 states
you'd be breaking the law.

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:21.379
And say they changed the law,
that don't change how people feel.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:25.967
You never put a wrong foot anywhere.
But you're out of line!

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:28.344
That's for me to decide, man.

01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:31.722
- Shut up and let me...
- Don't say that to me!

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:36.644
You have no right
after what I've been through.

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:41.357
You know that and I know that.
I know what you made of yourself...

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:45.152
...but I worked my ass off
to buy the chances you had!

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:49.490
You know how far I carried that bag
in 30 years?

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:53.661
Seventy-five thousand miles.
And mowing lawns in the dark...

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:58.290
...so you wouldn't be stoking furnaces
and could bear down on the books.

01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:02.962
There were things your mother should
have had that she insisted you have.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:08.050
And I don't mean fancy things.
I mean a decent coat. A lousy coat!

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:13.097
You'll say that means nothing?
You'll break your mother's heart?

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:19.812
What happens to men
when they grow old?

01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:23.774
Why do they forget everything?

01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:29.989
I believe those two young people
need each other...

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:33.534
...like they need the air
to breathe in.

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:38.122
Anybody can see that
by just looking at them.

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:40.791
But you and my husband...

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:44.170
...you might as well be blind men.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:48.966
You can only see
that they have a problem.

01:29:49.176 --> 01:29:52.595
But do you really know
what's happened to them...

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:55.514
...how they feel about each other?

01:29:57.059 --> 01:30:00.519
I believe that men grow old...

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:06.275
...and when sexual things
no longer matter to them...

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:11.864
...they forget it all,
forget what true passion is.

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:18.245
If you ever felt what my son...

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:25.169
...feels for your daughter, you and my
husband forgot everything about it.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:29.423
You knew once, but that
was a long time ago.

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:32.009
Now the two of you don't know.

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:37.598
And the strange thing
for your wife and me...

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:43.229
...is that you don't even remember.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:48.609
If you did, how could you do
what you are doing?

01:30:55.117 --> 01:30:59.245
I don't care what your mother says.
This is between you and me.

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:03.541
That's the first thing you've said
that makes any sense.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:07.795
- And what I mean to say...
- You've said what you had to say.

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:10.756
You listen to me.

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.720
You don't want to tell me
how to live my life?

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.223
So, what have you been doing?

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:24.061
You tell me what rights I've got
and what I owe you.

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:30.234
Let me tell you something.
I owe you nothing.

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:35.656
If you carried that bag a million
miles, you did what you had to do.

01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:38.284
You brought me into the world.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:42.329
From that day, you owed me
everything you could...

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:47.001
...like I will owe my son.
But you don't own me!

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:51.172
You can't tell me when or
where I'm out of line...

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:54.091
...or make me live by your rules.

01:31:54.926 --> 01:32:00.347
You don't know what or who I am, Dad.
How I feel, what I think!

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:04.935
And if I tried to explain,
you will never understand.

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:08.939
You are 30 years older than I am.

01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:14.320
Your generation thinks the way it was
is the way it's got to be!

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:17.072
Not until your generation dies...

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:20.576
...will your dead weight
be off our backs!

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:24.622
You understand?
You've got to get off my back!

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:49.188
Dad.

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:53.692
You're my father.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:57.112
I'm your son. I love you.

01:32:57.322 --> 01:33:02.284
I always have and I always will.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:06.038
But you think of yourself
as a colored man.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.834
I think of myself as a man.

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:21.011
Now, I've got a decision to make.

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:26.016
And I've got to make it alone,
and I've got to make it in a hurry.

01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:28.435
So...

01:33:29.688 --> 01:33:33.899
...would you go out there
and see after my mother?

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.532
Mom!

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:27.036
Oh, darling!

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:31.665
Talk John's parents
into flying over with you.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:36.378
It would mean so much to John,
and I know they can afford it.

01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:39.673
John's father will make
it rough for him.

01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:44.053
Did you see his expression
when he went to talk with Dad?

01:34:44.262 --> 01:34:49.516
- But don't you like her already?
- Yes, darling, I do. She's a good one.

01:34:49.726 --> 01:34:54.188
When John's father saw that I was
white, I thought he'd faint.

01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:59.693
- What about your own father?
- Yes. That was funny, wasn't it?

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:03.030
Mom, isn't this thrilling?
Aren't you just...?

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:06.533
Yes, darling, I am just...

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:58.377
I should be able to say something
to you, Mrs. Prentice.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:03.090
In my trade there are a hundred
clichÃ©d phrases of comfort...

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:05.843
...for every human condition.

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:09.471
But in the midst
of this heartbreaking distress...

01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:13.559
...I must admit
I'm completely stumped.

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:18.147
There's simply nothing I could say.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:24.486
- Mary, you've got to understand...
- Please, John.

01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:28.574
The monsignor is right.
Please, say no more.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:53.390
I'll be a son of a bitch.

01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:14.369
Close the door, Mr. Drayton.

01:37:25.298 --> 01:37:28.425
You didn't have the guts
to tell me face to face?

01:37:28.635 --> 01:37:31.428
Before you start telling me
about my guts...

01:37:31.638 --> 01:37:34.890
...I told you I'd have
something to say.

01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:37.684
Now I'm ready to say it.

01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:41.813
Are you going to stay in here?

01:37:50.907 --> 01:37:52.950
Joey.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.165
You know that I'm completely
sympathetic, don't you?

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:03.877
You know that I have
no reservations about anything.

01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:07.130
And whatever makes you happy,
I'm happy too.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:10.342
Of course I know that.

01:38:10.552 --> 01:38:13.637
Then listen to me, darling.

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:18.517
There's something I have to tell you
about this situation...

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.769
...which you don't really...

01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:26.191
Christina! What are you doing up
there? Joey! Come down, both of you!

01:38:28.695 --> 01:38:32.364
Can I get you a drink,
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice?

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:37.119
- No, thank you.
- John? Mike? No, you've had enough.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:40.706
- Dad. What's going on?
- There's something I want to say.

01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:45.919
I'd like you to sit down
and keep quiet. Please, sit down.

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.922
Sit down, Chris, please.

01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:54.886
I have a few things to say, and you
might just think they're important.

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:59.349
It's been a strange day.
That's not putting it too strongly.

01:38:59.559 --> 01:39:03.186
I might even say it's been
an extraordinary day.

01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:07.941
I've been thinking about the day
and the way it has gone...

01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:11.028
...and it seems to me that now...

01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:14.906
...I need to make a few personal
statements...

01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:17.492
...for a variety of reasons.

01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:27.794
The day began for me when I came in
and Tillie said to me...

01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:30.547
Excuse me. Tillie!

01:39:30.757 --> 01:39:32.549
This'll only take a second.

01:39:32.759 --> 01:39:37.054
- Everything's been ready...
- All right, Tillie. Sit down.

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:40.098
This is Miss Matilda Binks...

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:43.727
...who's been a member of this family
for 22 years.

01:39:43.936 --> 01:39:48.023
And who today has made a great
deal of trouble. Sit down.

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:55.822
Now, the minute I walked into
this house this afternoon...

01:39:56.032 --> 01:40:01.078
...Miss Binks said to me,
"All hell done broke loose now. "

01:40:01.287 --> 01:40:03.955
I asked to what she referred...

01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:07.918
...and she said, "You'll see. "
And I did.

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:13.548
After some preliminary guessing games,
at which I was never very good...

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:19.221
...it was explained by my daughter
that she intended to get married...

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:23.975
...and that her intended was a young
man whom I'd never met...

01:40:24.185 --> 01:40:26.895
...who happened to be a Negro.

01:40:27.105 --> 01:40:31.566
I think it's fair to say
that I responded to this news...

01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:34.778
...the same way that
any good father would...

01:40:34.987 --> 01:40:39.074
...unless his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:41.410
In a word, I was flabbergasted.

01:40:41.619 --> 01:40:44.788
And while I was
still being flabbergasted...

01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:49.501
...I was informed by my daughter,
a very determined young woman...

01:40:50.086 --> 01:40:55.090
...much like her mother,
that the marriage was on...

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:58.885
...no matter what her mother
and I might feel about it.

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:05.183
Then the next rather startling
development occurred, when you said...

01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:09.020
...that unless we approved
of the marriage...

01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:11.273
...there would be no marriage.

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:15.026
- You didn't. What a funny thing to do.
- Joey.

01:41:17.029 --> 01:41:21.992
This may be the last chance I'll
ever have to tell you to do anything.

01:41:22.201 --> 01:41:24.578
So I'm telling you, shut up.

01:41:28.458 --> 01:41:33.253
Now, it became clear
that we had one single day...

01:41:33.463 --> 01:41:37.966
...in which to make up our minds
about this situation.

01:41:38.176 --> 01:41:41.678
So, what happened?
My wife, typically enough...

01:41:41.888 --> 01:41:46.558
...decided to ignore every
practical aspect of the situation...

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:51.104
...and went off in a romantic haze,
which made her...

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:55.859
...totally inaccessible
to anything in the way of reason.

01:41:58.738 --> 01:42:02.908
I have not as yet referred
to His Reverence...

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:06.578
...who forced his way
into the situation...

01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:11.917
...insulted my intelligence
by mouthing 300 platitudes...

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:15.504
...and ended it by coming
to my room...

01:42:15.713 --> 01:42:19.132
...and challenging me
to a wrestling match.

01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:22.803
- What time is your plane?
- Ten forty-five.

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:25.305
Right.

01:42:25.515 --> 01:42:30.060
Now, Mr. Prentice,
clearly a most reasonable man...

01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:35.273
...says he has no wish to offend me
but wants to know if I'm a nut.

01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:39.444
Mrs. Prentice says that,
like her husband...

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:44.658
...I'm a burned-out shell of a man
who cannot remember what it's like...

01:42:44.867 --> 01:42:50.288
...to love a woman
the way her son loves my daughter.

01:42:55.711 --> 01:42:58.880
And strange as it seems...

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:02.217
...that's the first statement
made to me all day...

01:43:02.426 --> 01:43:05.595
...with which I'm prepared
to take issue.

01:43:08.266 --> 01:43:13.019
Because I think you're wrong.
You're as wrong as you could be.

01:43:14.063 --> 01:43:18.024
I admit that I hadn't considered it...

01:43:18.234 --> 01:43:21.778
...but I know exactly
how he feels about her.

01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:27.784
And there is absolutely nothing
that your son feels for my daughter...

01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:32.372
...that I didn't feel for Christina.

01:43:34.083 --> 01:43:36.126
Old, yes.

01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:39.170
Burned-out, certainly.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:43.842
But I can tell you,
the memories are still there.

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:48.680
Clear, intact, indestructible.

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:53.643
They'll be there if I live to be 110.
Where John made his mistake...

01:43:53.853 --> 01:43:58.398
...was attaching so much importance
to what we thought.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:03.528
Because in the final analysis it
doesn't matter a damn what we think.

01:44:03.738 --> 01:44:06.948
The only thing that matters
is what they feel...

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:12.162
...and how much they feel
for each other.

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:19.836
And if it's half of what we felt...

01:44:23.382 --> 01:44:25.383
...that's everything.

01:44:39.482 --> 01:44:45.528
As for the problems you'll have,
they seem almost unimaginable.

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:47.822
But you'll have no problem with me.

01:44:49.283 --> 01:44:53.620
And I think that when
Christina and I and your mother...

01:44:53.829 --> 01:44:59.250
...have time to work on him, you'll
have no problem with your father.

01:45:02.004 --> 01:45:07.425
But you do know, I'm sure you know,
what you're up against.

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:11.262
There'll be 100 million people
in this country...

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:16.893
...who'll be shocked and offended
and appalled at the two of you.

01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:21.564
And you'll have to ride that out...

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:25.276
...maybe every day
for the rest of your lives.

01:45:26.445 --> 01:45:29.614
You can try to ignore those people...

01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:33.868
...or even feel sorry for them
and for their bigotry...

01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:38.081
...and their blind hatreds
and stupid fears...

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:43.712
...but where necessary, you'll just
have to cling tight to each other...

01:45:44.046 --> 01:45:47.007
...and say, "Screw all those people. "

01:45:47.967 --> 01:45:52.637
Anybody could make a case
against your getting married.

01:45:53.305 --> 01:45:56.766
The arguments are so obvious,
nobody has to make them.

01:45:58.227 --> 01:46:01.271
But you're two wonderful people...

01:46:02.148 --> 01:46:04.107
...who fell in love...

01:46:05.443 --> 01:46:08.737
...and happened to have
a pigmentation problem.

01:46:09.655 --> 01:46:14.576
I think that no matter what kind
of a case some bastard could make...

01:46:14.785 --> 01:46:19.706
...against your getting married,
there'd be only one thing worse.

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:24.627
And that would be if,
knowing what you two are...

01:46:24.837 --> 01:46:27.005
...knowing what you two have...

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:30.216
...and knowing what you two feel...

01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:32.552
...you didn't get married.

01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:58.078
Well, Tillie. When the hell
we gonna get some dinner?

01:46:59.305 --> 01:47:05.625
