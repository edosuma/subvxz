00:27.410 --> 00:29.139
Turn, turn. There's the sign.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.645
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe we're finally here.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.409
Oh, wait. I told Shane I'd text him
once we're almost there.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.246
Oh, Mitchie...

00:36.386 --> 00:38.479
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

00:39.189 --> 00:40.713
Mom, obviously it's something.

00:40.857 --> 00:42.757
I mean, you and subtle
aren't very good friends.

00:44.094 --> 00:47.655
I know you and Shane talk all the time,
but, you know, it's...

00:47.797 --> 00:50.391
You actually haven't seen this boy
in almost a year.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.296
I just don't want you to be
too disappointed

00:52.435 --> 00:54.198
if he can't come to camp this summer.

00:54.337 --> 00:55.395
Mom.

00:55.538 --> 00:57.904
I want you to have fun
and focus on your music.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.908
Okay, first off,
this is gonna be the best summer ever.

01:01.044 --> 01:04.138
And second, nothing can make me
lose my focus.

01:04.681 --> 01:07.275
What is that?
Did somebody open another camp?

01:22.866 --> 01:25.699
Seriously, why would somebody
open up another camp across the lake?

01:25.835 --> 01:29.100
Oh, who knows, but I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

01:29.305 --> 01:32.274
- Aah! Caitlyn!
- Mitchie!

01:33.643 --> 01:35.008
Whew!

01:36.212 --> 01:37.839
- Hi!
- Caitlyn!

01:37.981 --> 01:39.778
- How are you?
- I'm great.

01:39.916 --> 01:41.611
- Let me take this for you.
- Thank you.

01:41.751 --> 01:44.219
I was so afraid that we weren't
gonna get here in time,

01:44.354 --> 01:47.050
- but doesn't look like many are here.
- You know what this means.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.886
Since we're the first ones here,
we totally get our choice of...

01:53.329 --> 01:54.489
...bunk.

02:00.503 --> 02:01.834
I bet you sounded fantastic.

02:02.572 --> 02:04.403
Yeah? Oh, my gosh.

02:05.141 --> 02:09.133
Well, I guess no one cares
about my life.

02:09.279 --> 02:12.544
What don't we know? I mean, you update
your status, like, every two seconds.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.112
Fine.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.753
- I have a question, and it's for Mitchie.
- For me?

02:20.723 --> 02:23.419
So, what's going on with you
and Shane?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.686
- Huh?
- Hm?

02:24.828 --> 02:27.228
- Nothing is going on.
- That's a total lie.

02:27.363 --> 02:29.729
You guys are obsessed.

02:29.866 --> 02:32.494
No, seriously. I don't know, I just...

02:32.635 --> 02:35.263
I feel like if we never get to spend
any time together,

02:35.405 --> 02:37.532
then nothing is ever gonna happen.

02:45.014 --> 02:47.244
Just one more crank and I think I got it.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.450
That's good.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.523
Can we please just wait for the tow truck?
Oliver tried and he couldn't get it.

02:55.859 --> 02:58.089
That's because Oliver's
not properly motivated.

02:58.228 --> 03:00.492
He's not trying to get to Camp Rock
before Mitchie.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.257
We should have never taken
that shortcut.

03:02.398 --> 03:04.798
Maybe because Oliver
doesn't even know Mitchie.

03:09.005 --> 03:10.063
Thanks.

03:11.140 --> 03:14.109
It's gonna be really cool.
I got it all planned.

03:14.811 --> 03:18.269
She'll walk in, and I'll be sitting there,
and I'll say,

03:18.414 --> 03:19.938
"Hey, Mitchie."

03:20.083 --> 03:22.483
She's gonna be so surprised.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.746
"Hey, Mitchie"? That's your big line?

03:24.888 --> 03:27.254
Trust me.
Everything's cool when I do it.

03:28.191 --> 03:30.625
I'm just excited to finally
spend some time with her.

03:32.061 --> 03:34.996
- Oh, here you go.
- Is this from the tire?

03:35.131 --> 03:38.396
Yeah. I saw it on the ground. Thought it
was important, so I put it in my pocket.

03:38.534 --> 03:39.899
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

03:40.036 --> 03:43.062
How could I have told you
if I didn't remember until now?

03:43.206 --> 03:45.003
- It's fine. Just one bolt, right?
- Mm-hm.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.301
- We good?
- Yeah.

03:51.447 --> 03:52.641
- Please.
- No.

03:52.782 --> 03:55.774
- Oh, please, don't. No, no, no.
- No!

03:59.155 --> 04:00.713
No!

04:02.792 --> 04:03.918
No, no, no!

04:14.404 --> 04:16.463
Told you it was important.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.622
Where is everybody?

04:34.757 --> 04:37.317
I know, right? There's, like,
barely anybody out there.

04:37.994 --> 04:40.292
I sure hope you've got something
we can do at opening jam.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.864
Because if not, I've got nothing.

04:43.399 --> 04:46.698
Kind of, maybe, sort of. I don't know. I...

04:46.836 --> 04:48.633
- Can we hear it?
- Sing it.

04:48.771 --> 04:51.001
Okay.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.040
- It's not finished.
- It's okay. Come on.

04:53.176 --> 04:54.575
- Not anything special.
- Come on.

04:55.311 --> 04:58.906
<i>Last year's old news</i>

04:59.048 --> 05:05.317
<i>I'm breakin' out my six-string
And playin' from my heart</i>

05:05.455 --> 05:07.685
- That is amazing.
- I love it.

05:07.824 --> 05:09.849
Really? Thank you.
That's all I got so far.

05:09.993 --> 05:12.655
I have a lot of lyrics,
but the music's not really worked out yet.

05:12.795 --> 05:16.356
Maybe we could just sing the first part
over and over again.

05:20.036 --> 05:22.004
- That's it.
- Really?

05:22.138 --> 05:24.606
Nobody ever agrees with me.

05:29.645 --> 05:32.580
- Barron! Sander!
- Hey, what's up?

05:32.715 --> 05:34.478
- Hey.
- Hi, how you doing?

05:34.617 --> 05:37.882
- Play it again.
- For you, Mitchie? Anything.

05:38.021 --> 05:39.613
Let's rock.

05:44.660 --> 05:47.094
<i>Oh</i>

05:47.230 --> 05:50.358
<i>Oh</i>

06:19.529 --> 06:24.660

06:24.801 --> 06:29.966

<i>So drama-free</i>

06:59.635 --> 07:04.595
<i>I'm all about the music
I just wanna sing</i>

07:04.740 --> 07:09.473
<i>Watch me live out my dreams</i>

07:09.612 --> 07:14.049
<i>I'm gonna rock that stage

07:15.251 --> 07:20.279

Come along, get in the groove</i>

07:20.423 --> 07:25.156

07:48.451 --> 07:50.817

Through the summer with you</i>

07:50.953 --> 07:52.682
<i>Who you gonna be?
Who you gonna be?</i>

07:53.289 --> 07:56.224
<i>You'll just have to watch me carefully</i>

07:56.359 --> 07:58.350
<i>Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?</i>

07:58.494 --> 08:00.519
<i>Anywhere my heart wants me to go</i>

08:00.663 --> 08:03.154
<i>I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna write, I'm gonna play</i>

08:03.299 --> 08:06.097

08:38.701 --> 08:40.692

08:40.836 --> 08:43.964

08:59.655 --> 09:02.249
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah!

09:03.092 --> 09:08.928
Yes, all right.
Mitchie Torres, returning rocker. Yes!

09:09.865 --> 09:14.598
Welcome to the heart and soul
of rock 'n' roll.

09:14.737 --> 09:17.331
Whether you're slick and happening
or dark and jamming,

09:17.473 --> 09:22.467
Camp Rock is the place to be, yeah?
All right!

09:24.113 --> 09:25.603
Now, I'm sure you've noticed

09:25.748 --> 09:29.206
that there aren't quite as many of you
as in years past, but not to worry.

09:31.587 --> 09:32.815
- Aah!
- Ooh!

09:32.955 --> 09:34.013
Shane!

09:34.523 --> 09:35.785
Sorry, she does that.

09:35.925 --> 09:39.019
Rockers, my nephews,
and Camp Rock alum,

09:39.161 --> 09:41.823
better known to the world
as Connect Three!

09:41.964 --> 09:44.091
Hey. Whoa!

09:45.935 --> 09:47.994
We probably shouldn't have
tied his shoes together.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.298
He's the one who said
he could make anything look cool.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.310
- Whoa.
- And I believe he stands corrected.

09:55.444 --> 10:00.575
- Shane. Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:00.716 --> 10:02.115
Surprise.

10:04.086 --> 10:08.716
All right. They are gonna be with us
for the entire summer.

10:09.325 --> 10:11.816
- The whole summer?
- Absolutely.

10:12.995 --> 10:16.624
The official reason being
they miss their uncle.

10:16.766 --> 10:19.132
But I don't think that's the entire story.

10:19.602 --> 10:21.661
Whoo!

10:21.804 --> 10:24.830
People are staring. You might wanna
do something, like react or wave.

10:26.342 --> 10:29.675
Hey, guys. I'm Shane.
This is Jason and Nate.

10:31.847 --> 10:35.647
We know it's gonna be hard,
but just treat us like normal campers.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.551
Wow. I guess it's not
gonna be that hard.

10:39.689 --> 10:43.022
Yeah, as I was saying, um,
we're a little smaller this year,

10:43.159 --> 10:48.324
and that is courtesy of our new friends
across the lake, Camp Star,

10:48.464 --> 10:52.662
founded, not so coincidentally,
by my out-to-destroy-me,

10:52.802 --> 10:55.828
still-mad-that-I kicked-him
out-of-the-group

10:55.971 --> 10:58.439
former bandmate, Axel Turner.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.098
Axel Turner?

11:00.242 --> 11:03.109
The guy who owns Star Records?
He's across the lake?

11:03.512 --> 11:07.278
Yes, and I share your disdain, Tess.
Thank you for that.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.880
Now, it's gonna take some effort,

11:10.019 --> 11:13.546
but I'm sure we can all
peacefully co-exist on the lake, yeah?

11:24.166 --> 11:25.463
We're under attack!

11:35.811 --> 11:36.869
Nice.

11:41.884 --> 11:45.718
- It's full of marshmallows.
- This one has chocolate.

11:46.756 --> 11:48.121
Graham crackers.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.785
Camp Rock's invited
to an opening-night bonfire.

11:55.731 --> 11:57.756
No, no, no. Absolutely not. No.

11:57.900 --> 12:01.961
<i>Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire!</i>

12:02.104 --> 12:07.371
- This is a setup. For what I'm not sure.
- Come on, Brown. It'll be fun.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.842
You said yourself
we all need to get along, right?

12:09.979 --> 12:12.539
And it's not just because I haven't
made dessert yet.

12:12.681 --> 12:15.912
This is really good chocolate. Isn't it?

12:22.625 --> 12:24.183
One word: wow.

12:24.326 --> 12:29.127
- This isn't a camp, it's a resort.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

12:30.566 --> 12:34.900
All right, I got it. Oh, I don't got it.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.133
I think we should add this
to the uncool list.

12:38.274 --> 12:41.266
A little help... A little help, please.

12:41.410 --> 12:42.638
Thank you.

12:42.778 --> 12:45.975
See, these are the type of things
that you can't learn over e-mail.

12:46.115 --> 12:47.946
Maybe we should go back to that.

12:48.918 --> 12:52.354
Guys, I'm not kidding.
Line up and wait for me.

12:52.488 --> 12:54.319
Junior rockers, I'm serious.

12:54.457 --> 12:56.391
Please wait.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.617
Hey, what's up, guys?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.694
I remember when I used to be
a junior rocker.

13:00.763 --> 13:03.789
- Is that a camera, bud?
- Don't touch it.

13:03.933 --> 13:06.629
What, you think I'm gonna drop it
in the water?

13:08.471 --> 13:11.531
And if you thought that,
I guess you'd be right.

13:13.642 --> 13:17.078
- You dropped it, Curly. You swim for it.
- Yeah.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.410
Brown, my man. Long time.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.482
- Hi, I'm Connie.
- Hi.

13:23.686 --> 13:26.951
Listen, Axel,
I don't actually know what your plan is...

13:27.089 --> 13:29.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
A breath and a step.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.556
I'm beginning to remember
why I left the band.

13:31.694 --> 13:34.720
Left the band. You left the band?

13:34.864 --> 13:37.526
That is so rich.
Is that what you're telling people?

13:37.666 --> 13:40.965
You, my friend, have got to stop
living in the past.

13:41.103 --> 13:42.695
I'm trying to reach out to you here.

13:43.272 --> 13:47.368
Reach out? Reach out by driving me
out of business. I love it.

13:47.510 --> 13:50.206
There's no reason why we both
can't be successful.

13:50.346 --> 13:53.213
- We both have our niche.
- Niche?

13:53.349 --> 13:57.115
Camp Star is dedicated
to producing the superstars of tomorrow.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.380
And what's your place about again?

13:59.522 --> 14:03.049
Encouraging kids
in their love of music, Axel.

14:03.359 --> 14:04.792
Ah.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.054
Like I said, room for both of us.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.560
You know, just to be clear,

14:13.702 --> 14:16.535
he did not leave the band.
We kicked him out.

14:16.672 --> 14:19.072
I know, I know. It's okay.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.273
We kicked him out.

14:22.878 --> 14:25.403
Question: What do you say
you and I break away later

14:25.548 --> 14:28.016
and I finally take you on a first date?

14:28.150 --> 14:30.744
Answer: I'd like that.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.386
Check, check. One, two. Check, check.

14:36.525 --> 14:38.891
One, two. Check, check, check.

14:39.395 --> 14:40.794
Wow.

14:40.930 --> 14:45.458
I know, right? That's all I've been saying
since I got off the boat.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.900
Come on.

14:56.845 --> 14:59.279
- Ready?
- We really shouldn't be here.

14:59.415 --> 15:02.248
It's so obvious this guy's just doing this
to get back at Brown.

15:02.718 --> 15:06.518
First, he tries to take down
the White Crows, and now Camp Rock.

15:06.755 --> 15:08.245
What is that?

15:08.390 --> 15:10.915
Hot chocolate. They're handing it out free
when you walk in,

15:11.060 --> 15:13.028
plus you get to keep the mug.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.288
What?

15:17.066 --> 15:19.159
There's no way I'm staying
at this bonfire.

15:20.069 --> 15:23.368
Hey, pouty boy. You better hurry.
The bonfire's about to start.

15:25.975 --> 15:28.500
You know, we should probably
go take our seats.

15:29.445 --> 15:32.107
- I think they're about to start.
- Mm-hm.

15:32.247 --> 15:34.272
- Don't mock.
- I'm not.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.543
- Yes, you are.
- Okay, just a little bit.

15:40.322 --> 15:43.416
Look, they actually have a real Wardrobe
Department with incredible fabric.

15:43.559 --> 15:44.617
And they let me make this.

15:45.427 --> 15:48.624
Uh-oh. I think I just sewed
my scarf to my bra.

15:49.498 --> 15:51.659
So I thought this was supposed
to be a campfire.

15:51.800 --> 15:56.032
You know, singing, telling stories,
an actual fire.

15:56.171 --> 15:57.661
Everybody have a seat.

15:59.975 --> 16:01.499
I'm Axel Turner.

16:03.812 --> 16:10.081
And I'd like to welcome all you rockers,
and my dear, old friend, Brown Cesario...

16:11.820 --> 16:13.447
Yeah, Brown! Whoo!

16:13.589 --> 16:14.749
to Camp Star!

16:17.326 --> 16:19.260
Go, Brown!

16:22.197 --> 16:24.324
But you all don't wanna hear a speech
from me.

16:24.466 --> 16:28.835
You wanna get to what a campfire
is really all about:

16:29.304 --> 16:30.669
Singing.

16:30.806 --> 16:33.206
Hey, that's what you just said.
You're twins.

16:34.476 --> 16:38.879
So does anyone have anything
they'd like to play?

16:39.014 --> 16:42.006
Camp Rockers, don't be shy.

16:44.887 --> 16:48.220
Well, we'll go, if nobody else wants to.

17:01.537 --> 17:05.233
This song is about me
and a friend of mine.

17:19.588 --> 17:23.148
<i>We're like a melody with no words</i>

17:23.291 --> 17:26.021
<i>Until we figure it out</i>

17:26.161 --> 17:31.531
<i>We sing, "la, la, la, la, la, la"</i>

17:31.667 --> 17:38.732
<i>I know it's simple, yeah
But it's worked right up till now</i>

17:38.874 --> 17:42.776
<i>'Cause up till now, yeah</i>

17:43.479 --> 17:48.143
<i>Every day's been like a dream world</i>

17:48.283 --> 17:52.947
<i>Oh, but now you're not just in my head</i>

17:53.088 --> 17:55.056
<i>Oh, no</i>

17:55.190 --> 18:00.992
<i>Will we remember different summers?</i>

18:01.130 --> 18:07.091
<i>It's like tossing your heart
To see where it lands</i>

18:07.236 --> 18:15.974
<i>Heads is easy
Tails is harder to plan</i>

18:16.111 --> 18:24.815
<i>If we're starting all over again
And again and again</i>

18:24.953 --> 18:32.621
<i>Oh, you know that I can't help but wonder
What's gonna happen next</i>

18:32.761 --> 18:38.631
<i>I'm a little curious
Oh, yeah</i>

18:38.767 --> 18:44.831
<i>Every star that I stood under
When you were under it too</i>

18:44.973 --> 18:47.737
<i>Did you ever think about us?</i>

18:50.045 --> 18:55.950
<i>I hope you did
'Cause I can tell you</i>

18:56.084 --> 19:00.077
<i>That's something I'll never forget</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:01.814
<i>I won't forget</i>

19:01.957 --> 19:07.759
<i>If we remember different summers</i>

19:07.896 --> 19:13.835
<i>It's like tossing your heart
To see where it lands</i>

19:13.969 --> 19:23.071
<i>Heads is easy
Tails is harder to plan</i>

19:23.212 --> 19:31.586
<i>If we're starting all over again
Only friends</i>

19:31.720 --> 19:40.685
<i>Just beginning
But I hope that we find it again</i>

19:40.829 --> 19:45.960
<i>So we can go from here</i>

19:46.101 --> 19:49.696
<i>Oh</i>

19:50.639 --> 19:56.441
<i>Will we remember different summers?</i>

19:56.578 --> 20:02.574
<i>It's like tossing your heart
To see where it lands</i>

20:02.718 --> 20:11.649
<i>Heads is easy
Tails is harder to plan</i>

20:11.793 --> 20:19.393
<i>If we're starting all over again</i>

20:19.534 --> 20:21.092
<i>Oh-oh</i>

20:21.236 --> 20:26.731
<i>Again and again and again and again</i>

20:26.875 --> 20:32.973
<i>Again and again and again</i>

20:33.115 --> 20:39.418
<i>Will we remember different summers?</i>

20:41.023 --> 20:42.081
Whoo!

20:54.303 --> 20:57.363
That was sweet.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.802
But I guess it's time for Camp Star
to answer.

21:00.943 --> 21:04.970
And, heh, my apologies
if we embarrass ourselves.

21:05.113 --> 21:06.580
We're kind of new at this.

21:23.966 --> 21:27.163
<i>Nobody's gonna wanna get next to me</i>

21:27.302 --> 21:29.634
<i>- 'Cause they know
- They know</i>

21:29.771 --> 21:32.069
<i>I take what's mine and won't let it go</i>

21:32.207 --> 21:35.643
<i>Doesn't matter
How you approach the scene</i>

21:35.777 --> 21:37.711
<i>- Just hope
- Just hope</i>

21:37.846 --> 21:39.837
<i>You're everything and more
When you hit the door</i>

21:39.982 --> 21:43.713
<i>I dare you to challenge me
You'll be beggin' for mercy, please</i>

21:43.852 --> 21:47.117
<i>Just watch
I'll give you something to follow</i>

21:47.255 --> 21:49.223
<i>'Cause I've been waitin' so patiently</i>

21:49.358 --> 21:51.383
<i>- To let the
- Fire come out in me</i>

21:51.526 --> 21:54.495
<i>I'm what you're up against
Just letting you know</i>

21:54.629 --> 22:01.034
<i>I keep giving you the fire
I'm gonna heat it up under my control</i>

22:01.169 --> 22:03.399
<i>Here's the night
That you've been waitin' on</i>

22:03.538 --> 22:05.028
<i>Fire</i>

22:05.173 --> 22:09.576
<i>I'm gonna light it up
Gotta make it hot</i>

22:09.711 --> 22:11.770
<i>The stage is mine
I'll set it on</i>

22:11.913 --> 22:15.371
<i>The king is gone
And no one can take his crown</i>

22:15.517 --> 22:17.109
<i>- So brave
- So brave</i>

22:17.252 --> 22:19.880
<i>They can't cool me off
When I hit the stage</i>

22:20.022 --> 22:23.082
<i>Burning hot
The spotlight just spelled my name</i>

22:23.225 --> 22:25.352
<i>- I feel famous
- Famous</i>

22:25.494 --> 22:28.122
<i>The crowd cheers me on
They can't get enough</i>

22:28.263 --> 22:31.790
<i>I dare you to challenge me
You'll be beggin' for mercy, please</i>

22:31.933 --> 22:35.232
<i>Just watch
I'll give you something to follow</i>

22:35.370 --> 22:37.861
<i>'Cause I've been waitin' so patiently</i>

22:38.006 --> 22:39.200
<i>Fire come out in me</i>

22:39.341 --> 22:42.401
<i>I'm what you're up against
Just letting you know</i>

22:42.544 --> 22:48.744
<i>I keep giving you the fire
I'm gonna heat it up under my control</i>

22:48.884 --> 22:52.081
<i>Here's the night
That you've been waitin' on</i>

22:52.220 --> 22:56.816
<i>Fire
I'm gonna light it up, gotta make it hot</i>

22:57.526 --> 23:00.791
<i>The stage is mine
I'll set it on</i>

23:14.476 --> 23:20.779
<i>I keep giving you the fire
I'm gonna heat it up under my control</i>

23:20.916 --> 23:23.749
<i>Here's the night
That you've been waitin' on</i>

23:23.885 --> 23:25.011
<i>Fire</i>

23:25.153 --> 23:29.317
<i>I'm gonna light it up, gotta make it hot</i>

23:29.458 --> 23:31.949
<i>The stage is mine
I'll set it on</i>

23:32.094 --> 23:34.756
<i>Fire</i>

23:35.163 --> 23:37.427
- Ow!
- Nate, are you okay?

23:42.404 --> 23:44.634
You guys rock!

23:47.542 --> 23:52.844
And that's how we do things
here at Camp Star!

23:53.882 --> 23:55.315
- Wow.
- Ha-ha-ha!

24:00.922 --> 24:04.289
Before we go any further,
I'd like to make a quick announcement.

24:04.426 --> 24:08.226
We're having staffing problems.
Who knew we'd be so popular?

24:08.363 --> 24:10.388
All right, now we're under attack.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.523
So I'd just like to put it out there.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.966
If there are any Camp Rock
counselors or staff

24:16.104 --> 24:18.402
who'd like to make the switch,

24:18.874 --> 24:21.206
I'd be more than willing
to double your salary.

24:21.343 --> 24:24.403
You've gotta be joking.
I barely have enough staff as it is.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.878
- I'll go.
- What?

24:27.015 --> 24:29.313
- Count me in.
- No.

24:29.451 --> 24:33.410
And if there are any Camp Rock campers
who'd like to join us,

24:33.555 --> 24:35.079
well, I'm sure we can find you a bunk.

24:35.223 --> 24:39.387
Oh, did I mention
our cabins are air-conditioned?

24:39.828 --> 24:40.988
He can't do this.

24:41.129 --> 24:45.065
Right. I need all the Camp Rockers
back on the boats now. Come on.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.668
- Go, please.
- Come on, guys. Back to the boats.

24:47.802 --> 24:50.202
Let's go. Come on.

25:00.215 --> 25:02.410
Are you sure it's okay?

25:02.551 --> 25:03.779
Not a scratch.

25:03.919 --> 25:08.583
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Oh, it's all good. I'm totally fine.

25:08.723 --> 25:10.554
I'm just happy I could catch it for you.

25:11.059 --> 25:12.959
Well, it's always
kind of been my lucky charm.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.187
I guess it still works.

25:16.731 --> 25:19.029
Did you forget the part
where you hit him in the eye?

25:22.204 --> 25:24.399
I'll be over there.

25:25.607 --> 25:29.805
So, Dana, you were amazing up there.

25:30.412 --> 25:32.277
You think?
I'm just glad it's finally over.

25:32.414 --> 25:34.211
We've been practicing for weeks,

25:34.349 --> 25:38.115
and still, every time I go on,
I'm almost sure I'm gonna throw up.

25:39.554 --> 25:41.044
I'm really glad you guys came.

25:41.189 --> 25:43.054
My dad was totally sure
none of you would show.

25:44.192 --> 25:45.318
My dad's Axel Turner.

25:47.062 --> 25:49.292
He's your dad?

25:49.431 --> 25:52.127
Everybody says that,
and kind of exactly like that,

25:52.267 --> 25:54.827
but trust me, once you get to know him,
he's a really great guy.

25:57.038 --> 25:59.404
Well, I guess I should go.

26:00.175 --> 26:02.473
Here. You don't wanna lose it.

26:03.111 --> 26:04.908
You can keep it if you want.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.883
- What would I do with a bracelet?
- Right.

26:10.018 --> 26:13.613
For the record, I'm glad you're okay.
You have really pretty eyes.

26:16.324 --> 26:20.055
Sorry, that was weird. I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

26:20.195 --> 26:23.255
No, it's all good.
People tell me that all the time.

26:23.398 --> 26:26.663
Probably because
they're right in the middle of my face, so...

26:29.604 --> 26:30.969
So...

26:31.106 --> 26:32.698
What...?

26:33.141 --> 26:37.441
- Um, I'll see you around.
- Okay.

26:40.382 --> 26:43.442
Yes, I wanna keep it,
you have pretty eyes too. Stupid.

26:47.222 --> 26:49.315
- I'm an idiot.
- Wow.

26:49.457 --> 26:51.755
Something we both can agree on.

26:52.827 --> 26:55.227
Ow! Strong idiot.

26:58.099 --> 27:02.593
I... I don't want you talking to that boy.

27:02.737 --> 27:06.298
Don't worry,
I don't think it's gonna be a problem.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.744
Okay, come on.

27:11.746 --> 27:13.873
Rockers, boats now.

27:17.819 --> 27:22.279
Wow. Now, this is a recording studio.

27:22.824 --> 27:24.485
Hey.

27:24.926 --> 27:27.793
Um, hi.

27:28.163 --> 27:29.596
Can I help you with something?

27:30.332 --> 27:31.765
Do I look like I need help?

27:33.134 --> 27:37.070
- Do I know you?
- That's funny. I'm Luke.

27:37.205 --> 27:38.866
Luke Williams.

27:39.007 --> 27:41.976
I was just on-stage,
like two minutes ago.

27:42.110 --> 27:45.409
<i>I'm giving you the fire</i>

27:50.819 --> 27:54.516
- Wow, impressive.
- I know, right? It's kind of my thing.

27:54.656 --> 27:57.181
So you thinking about joining us
over here?

27:57.325 --> 27:59.520
No, I'm perfectly happy where I am.

27:59.894 --> 28:02.590
Well, you are Shane Gray's girlfriend,
so...

28:02.731 --> 28:05.723
Wait, what does Shane...?
How do you even know that?

28:05.867 --> 28:08.768
You have to know the players
if you wanna be in the game, right?

28:08.903 --> 28:10.700
- No.
- It's a tough business.

28:11.306 --> 28:12.568
It's summer camp.

28:12.707 --> 28:14.641
To you, but to anybody at Camp Star,

28:14.776 --> 28:17.301
it's step one to a long
and illustrious career.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.310
I don't have time for second-rate.

28:19.981 --> 28:23.246
- We're not second-rate.
- You don't have to get all defensive.

28:23.385 --> 28:25.876
It's none of my business,
you don't have to try to convince me.

28:26.020 --> 28:27.988
I'm not trying to do anything.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.956
Good.
You're at the perfect place for you.

28:31.292 --> 28:35.922
Look, just so we're clear,
Luke "I'm giving you the fire" Williams,

28:36.064 --> 28:39.795
or whatever your name is,
not one Camp Rocker,

28:39.934 --> 28:42.732
not in a million years,
would ever even think about coming over

28:42.871 --> 28:46.739
to this narcissistic, over-produced
ego factory.

28:46.875 --> 28:49.901
Guess what. My mom said yes.
I get to make the switch.

28:50.044 --> 28:53.013
That's great.
Welcome to the ego factory.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.809
Thanks.

28:54.949 --> 28:56.610
Tess, how could you?

28:56.751 --> 29:00.847
Oh, I'm so sorry. I feel horrible, but...

29:02.390 --> 29:06.451
Who am I kidding? I am so excited,
I can't even pretend to be sympathetic.

29:06.594 --> 29:08.528
That was great what you did up there.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.723
<i>I'm giving you the fire</i>

29:11.866 --> 29:14.528
- So impressive.
- I know, right?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.637
Wow.

29:16.771 --> 29:19.831
Good luck trying to find a spotlight
big enough for the both of you.

29:32.287 --> 29:34.482
No, you guys, it's gonna be okay.

29:34.622 --> 29:37.147
I mean, Brown's a smart guy,
he can figure something out.

29:37.292 --> 29:39.954
Thanks for that vote of confidence,
Mitchie.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.889
Guess I don't have to get
everyone's attention.

29:44.032 --> 29:49.493
So the good news is,
and this really warms my heart,

29:49.637 --> 29:51.502
we lost very few campers last night.

29:55.176 --> 29:56.871
That's right.

29:57.445 --> 30:01.040
But we did lose
quite a few of our remaining staff.

30:01.182 --> 30:05.812
Which means,
and I can't believe I have to say this,

30:06.120 --> 30:08.680
Camp Rock is closed,
effective immediately.

30:09.157 --> 30:10.351
- Wait, what?
- No.

30:10.492 --> 30:14.223
You have to believe me, I truly...
I've got no other option.

30:15.296 --> 30:18.129
I'll start calling parents
as soon as we're done here,

30:18.533 --> 30:20.330
which I guess is now.

30:20.668 --> 30:22.602
I'm sorry.

30:23.004 --> 30:25.802
Brown, wait. Guys.

30:26.474 --> 30:28.999
Camp is over? But we just got here.

30:29.143 --> 30:31.907
It's not his fault. I mean,
there's nothing he can do about it.

30:32.046 --> 30:34.446
Man, this is such a bummer.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.174
But...

30:37.552 --> 30:40.020
...that doesn't mean
there isn't something we can do about it.

30:40.154 --> 30:41.348
- What?
- Mitchie.

30:41.489 --> 30:42.956
No, I'm serious.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.185
This is our summer,
and we're not giving up.

30:46.561 --> 30:48.859
- We're not backing down.
- Right.

30:48.997 --> 30:50.362
I don't know, Mitchie.

30:50.798 --> 30:53.699
<i>We can't, we can't back down</i>

30:54.669 --> 30:58.070
<i>We can't, we can't back down</i>

30:58.806 --> 31:02.242
<i>We can't, we can't back down</i>

31:02.810 --> 31:06.041
<i>We can't, we can't back down</i>

31:06.180 --> 31:09.809
<i>Not right now, we can't back down</i>

31:09.951 --> 31:13.648
<i>Not right now, we can't back down</i>

31:13.788 --> 31:16.689
<i>We can't back down</i>

31:16.824 --> 31:19.486
<i>Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah</i>

31:21.996 --> 31:24.965
<i>Don't close your eyes</i>

31:25.099 --> 31:28.330
<i>We're all in this together</i>

31:28.469 --> 31:31.632
<i>Wherever they draw the line</i>

31:33.041 --> 31:37.740
<i>We're not gonna straddle, we'll cross it
Or lose it</i>

31:37.879 --> 31:42.339
<i>We can't back down
There's too much at stake</i>

31:42.483 --> 31:45.611
<i>This is serious, don't walk away</i>

31:45.753 --> 31:52.454
<i>We can't pretend it's not happening
In our own backyard</i>

31:52.594 --> 31:54.687
<i>Our own home plate</i>

31:54.829 --> 31:56.694
<i>- We've been called out
- We've been called out</i>

31:56.831 --> 31:58.355
<i>- Do you hear your name?
- Yeah</i>

31:58.499 --> 32:01.696
<i>I'm not confused
Let's win this thing</i>

32:01.836 --> 32:06.500
<i>We can't back down
There's too much at stake</i>

32:06.641 --> 32:08.040
<i>Don't walk away</i>

32:08.176 --> 32:10.440
<i>- Don't walk away
- Don't walk away</i>

32:10.578 --> 32:13.206
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

32:14.048 --> 32:16.949
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

32:17.085 --> 32:20.418
<i>I don't like confrontation</i>

32:20.555 --> 32:24.286
<i>I'd rather we all just get along</i>

32:25.093 --> 32:29.757
<i>Music should be undivided
United</i>

32:29.897 --> 32:34.129
<i>We can't back down
There's too much at stake</i>

32:34.268 --> 32:37.567
<i>This is serious
Don't walk away</i>

32:37.705 --> 32:44.201
<i>We can't pretend it's not happening
In our own backyard</i>

32:44.345 --> 32:46.142
<i>Our own home plate</i>

32:46.280 --> 32:48.339
<i>- We've been called out
- We've been called out</i>

32:48.483 --> 32:50.815
<i>- Do you hear your name?
- Yeah</i>

32:50.952 --> 32:54.444
<i>I'm not confused, let's win this thing</i>

32:54.589 --> 32:58.389
<i>We can't back down
There's too much at stake</i>

32:58.526 --> 33:01.927
<i>Don't walk away
Don't walk away</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:06.898
<i>Don't walk away</i>

33:07.035 --> 33:09.663
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

33:10.972 --> 33:13.702
<i>We've got a situation
That we can't ignore</i>

33:13.841 --> 33:18.835
<i>'Cause ignorance is not bliss
We don't have to take this, no</i>

33:18.980 --> 33:20.413
<i>With every big decision</i>

33:20.548 --> 33:24.245
<i>Comes an equally important
Share of the risk</i>

33:24.385 --> 33:28.151
<i>- We've gotta take this, ohh
- We can't back down</i>

33:28.289 --> 33:30.484
<i>- There's too much at stake
- Too much</i>

33:30.625 --> 33:33.822
<i>This is serious
Don't walk away</i>

33:33.961 --> 33:40.298
<i>We can't pretend it's not happening
In our own backyard</i>

33:40.435 --> 33:42.062
<i>Our own home plate</i>

33:42.203 --> 33:44.398
<i>We've been called out</i>

33:44.539 --> 33:46.473
<i>- Do you hear your name?
- We've been called out</i>

33:46.607 --> 33:49.735
<i>I'm not confused, let's win this thing</i>

33:49.877 --> 33:52.209
<i>- We can't back down
- We've been called out</i>

33:52.346 --> 33:54.473
<i>- There's too much at stake
- We've been called out</i>

33:54.615 --> 33:57.641
<i>Don't walk away, don't walk away</i>

33:57.785 --> 34:01.653
<i>We can't back down
We can't back down</i>

34:01.789 --> 34:05.589
<i>Not right now
We can't back down</i>

34:12.667 --> 34:14.567
What's going on?

34:15.069 --> 34:18.469
Well, you said you needed
some new counselors,

34:18.606 --> 34:20.437
so I found you some.

34:24.045 --> 34:27.674
Then it looks like
I should call this staff meeting to order.

34:28.116 --> 34:29.639
- Yes!
- Thank you.

34:30.685 --> 34:31.913
- Yes.
- All right.

34:32.652 --> 34:33.847
Come on, Terry.

34:33.987 --> 34:38.083
<i>No, nada. Guys, I already told you,
I'm not gonna be doing this.</i>

34:38.226 --> 34:41.592
Jason, you're looking at this all wrong.

34:42.029 --> 34:45.192
This isn't punishment. It's a reward.

34:46.266 --> 34:47.427
- Really?
- Really.

34:47.568 --> 34:50.536
This just means that everybody thinks
that you have the leadership skills,

34:50.670 --> 34:53.161
the maturity, the intelligence...

34:53.306 --> 34:55.502
- You think I'm intelligent?
- No.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.543
- and the sheer guts
to take on this challenge.

34:58.112 --> 35:00.103
- Wow, you're good.
- Thank you.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.181
You're right. This is an honor.

35:04.318 --> 35:07.845
Exactly.
Now, get in there and make us proud.

35:08.956 --> 35:11.288
We'll be right here if you need us.

35:13.961 --> 35:15.326
All right.

35:16.664 --> 35:18.359
- Run.
- Run.

35:18.666 --> 35:21.066
Hi, everybody. I'm Jason.

35:21.469 --> 35:23.369
I'm gonna be your counselor.

35:23.504 --> 35:26.803
I'm a little new at this so I thought
you guys would go a little bit easier on me.

35:26.941 --> 35:27.999
What do you say?

35:28.142 --> 35:30.303
I say, let's get him.

35:30.444 --> 35:32.708
- Yeah!
- Guys, guys, hold on a minute.

35:37.018 --> 35:38.076
Now get him.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.914
No, no, no.

35:47.795 --> 35:49.319
All right, let's dance.

35:50.364 --> 35:51.558
Sorry.

36:21.329 --> 36:22.819
- All good?
- All good.

36:22.964 --> 36:24.556
Let's do this.

36:30.071 --> 36:31.629
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

36:32.306 --> 36:34.206
Here we go, guys. All right.

36:34.342 --> 36:37.539
Circle, down. Head, meet, out.

36:42.683 --> 36:45.379
<i>- Louder.
- La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

36:45.519 --> 36:46.713
Awesome.

36:46.854 --> 36:50.085
We got a color that looks good with his
eye color. What about this, girls? Right?

36:52.593 --> 36:53.685
Hi.

37:14.749 --> 37:15.977
Enough.

37:16.784 --> 37:18.376
Do you wanna rock?

37:18.519 --> 37:20.350
Well, you know what?
You don't deserve to rock.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.979
Why should I show you
the first thing about being a rock star,

37:23.124 --> 37:25.786
if you don't wanna show me
any respect?

37:28.529 --> 37:30.224
Well, okay, then.

37:30.898 --> 37:32.263
Who wants to play the drums?

37:35.236 --> 37:36.533
Who wants to play the guitar?

37:38.105 --> 37:39.697
Who wants to be a lead singer?

37:41.409 --> 37:45.038
Well, you are gonna have to buy tighter
pants and learn how to play a tambourine.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.977
- I heard that.
- Sorry.

37:48.716 --> 37:50.616
It's true.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.324
- Nate?
- Yeah.

38:01.896 --> 38:04.694
Shane. Heh. What's up, bro?

38:05.132 --> 38:06.326
What are you doing?

38:07.335 --> 38:09.326
Um, lifeguard duty.

38:09.470 --> 38:11.631
Schedule's a mess,
but you can't be too careful.

38:13.274 --> 38:15.401
Just one last look.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.275
All clear.

38:25.052 --> 38:28.283
So, what do I have to do
to pull you away from this clipboard?

38:28.422 --> 38:32.984
Mitchie, I just rolled 100 pounds
of raw hamburger all by myself.

38:33.127 --> 38:35.220
I told you, honey, I needed help.

38:35.363 --> 38:38.924
No, no, no, that's impossible.
I know for a fact that I scheduled...

38:39.066 --> 38:42.001
- Absolutely nobody. I'm so sorry.
- What's going on?

38:42.470 --> 38:44.802
This isn't working.
The kitchen is a disaster.

38:44.939 --> 38:47.339
Yesterday,
I ordered 50 pounds of black beans

38:47.475 --> 38:51.172
and they delivered
50 cases of beach balls instead.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.216
Well, you gotta admit, Mom,
you don't have the best handwriting.

38:56.350 --> 38:58.511
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, it's rock 'n' roll, right?

38:58.652 --> 39:00.381
It's gonna be a little chaotic.

39:00.521 --> 39:04.287
I think you're doing great. We'll just make
some adjustments to the schedule, yeah?

39:04.425 --> 39:07.258
Perfect.
Shane, help Connie with the hamburgers.

39:07.628 --> 39:09.459
Actually, I've... I've got this thing...

39:09.597 --> 39:12.760
- Oh, really? Well, come on, pretty boy.
- No, but...

39:16.303 --> 39:19.864
All right, that's it. Now pick it up.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.133
Bring it home.

39:26.514 --> 39:29.142
I knew you could do it,
All right, now it's getting a little late,

39:29.283 --> 39:31.308
so, what do you say
we all go enjoy some free time?

39:31.452 --> 39:32.646
- Yeah.
- All right.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.976
Hey, man. What are you doing?

39:58.079 --> 39:59.808
Why does everybody keep doing that?

39:59.947 --> 40:03.314
Sorry, we're just doing our part
as activity directors.

40:04.585 --> 40:06.143
And what's the activity today?

40:06.287 --> 40:07.515
Wakeboarding.

40:09.690 --> 40:10.748
No!

40:22.269 --> 40:24.328
Are you okay?

40:24.772 --> 40:26.865
Yeah, I'm great.

40:28.976 --> 40:31.843
Don't suppose you came over here
to see anyone in particular.

40:31.979 --> 40:34.345
No, just getting some exercise.

40:35.783 --> 40:36.943
Do you play a lot of sports?

40:38.419 --> 40:40.944
Canoeing. That's pretty much it.

40:41.088 --> 40:45.218
I'm really not all that sporty either. I played
soccer when I was little, but who doesn't?

40:46.193 --> 40:49.594
I don't know if it counts as a sport,
but I'd kind of love to be a dancer.

40:49.730 --> 40:52.893
It's like my nerdy secret, "if I could
be anything, that's what I'd be" wish.

40:53.934 --> 40:55.299
What would you be?

40:55.436 --> 40:57.336
I don't know. Never thought about it.

40:57.471 --> 40:59.871
Probably because if you could
be anything, you'd be you.

41:02.977 --> 41:05.707
Uh, do you wanna hear something
really stupid?

41:06.413 --> 41:11.646
I was goofing around and I accidentally
sort of wrote your name on my hand

41:11.785 --> 41:15.152
but used permanent ink by mistake.

41:15.289 --> 41:17.587
No one's ever written my name
on their hand before.

41:18.125 --> 41:20.252
Really more my wrist.

41:21.228 --> 41:22.695
- Dana...
- Yeah?

41:22.830 --> 41:24.092
Dana?

41:24.231 --> 41:28.395
Oh, it's my dad. I'm so sorry,
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

41:28.536 --> 41:30.333
Hurry. Go.

41:31.172 --> 41:32.833
Dana?

41:33.841 --> 41:35.832
- Dana.
- Hey.

41:35.976 --> 41:38.069
- I saw this canoe.
- Ugh.

41:39.180 --> 41:43.412
Don't touch it, it's one of theirs.
I'll have an attendant fish it out.

41:43.551 --> 41:46.179
- What's that on your wrist?
- Nothing.

41:49.056 --> 41:50.717
You wanna know what I wanna be?

41:50.858 --> 41:53.622
The kind of guy
who can tell you how he really feels.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.127
I hate canoes.

42:01.835 --> 42:04.929
- I'm still an idiot.
- I still agree.

42:05.372 --> 42:07.033
Dude, you can't keep hitting me.

42:07.174 --> 42:08.766
Thank you.

42:10.544 --> 42:12.034
Ow!

42:12.179 --> 42:13.237
Thanks, Mitchie.

42:13.380 --> 42:15.541
I had absolutely the best day ever.

42:15.683 --> 42:19.449
- Everything's finally starting to work out.
- That's great. It's all because of you.

42:20.087 --> 42:21.315
No, it's because of us.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.218
Now that everybody else
has gotten your time,

42:23.357 --> 42:25.257
I think I'm gonna demand
some of my own.

42:25.392 --> 42:27.656
It hasn't been that bad.

42:28.195 --> 42:30.755
The whole reason I'm here,
the reason my brothers are here,

42:30.898 --> 42:33.264
is so I can get to know you better.

42:33.667 --> 42:36.227
It's only been like two seconds.

42:36.370 --> 42:39.999
And that is the sweetest thing
that anybody has ever said to me.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.664
- But...
- But...

42:41.809 --> 42:44.073
<i>And now a word
from your friendly neighborhood announcer.</i>

42:44.211 --> 42:48.011
<i>Will the counselors scheduled for
the bonfire please report to the mess hall?</i>

42:48.148 --> 42:51.606
- But you gotta go.
- But we gotta go.

42:54.588 --> 42:55.646
Are you coming?

42:56.090 --> 42:57.785
No, it's cool. I'll catch up.

42:58.492 --> 43:01.359
- Shane.
- Go, they need you.

43:02.229 --> 43:03.958
Okay.

43:17.778 --> 43:20.508
- Hey. I'm impressed.
- Eh.

43:20.648 --> 43:23.310
You seem to be doing
much better with them.

43:23.450 --> 43:26.647
It took a little bit of time,
but I think I finally gained their respect.

43:35.062 --> 43:37.326
Who glued me to this log?

43:39.033 --> 43:42.400
Log Butt, log Butt!
We're gonna call you Log Butt!

43:42.536 --> 43:44.834
You know what's worse
than being called Log Butt?

43:44.972 --> 43:47.202
Is being sat on by Log Butt.

43:47.341 --> 43:49.036
Oh! Whoo!

43:49.176 --> 43:51.838
Run. Run, he's got you.

43:51.979 --> 43:53.776
Come back here.

43:55.015 --> 43:56.380
Fireflies.

43:56.517 --> 43:58.917
- I'm gonna get this one.
- Okay, catch them, everybody.

43:59.053 --> 44:00.714
Let's jump. Jump.

44:07.227 --> 44:10.162
<i>Looks like the Lord of the Flies
over there.</i>

44:10.297 --> 44:13.494
There's no way they're gonna make it
through the summer.

44:15.602 --> 44:18.901
I remember doing that. It's fun.

44:19.273 --> 44:21.400
Don't even think about it.

44:30.751 --> 44:34.050
It felt so great just standing up
in front of that class today.

44:34.488 --> 44:36.615
I feel like there's nothing we can't do.

44:36.757 --> 44:39.954
Pleats. Still can't do pleats.

44:40.761 --> 44:43.457
Wish we had that attitude
the other night at Camp Star.

44:43.597 --> 44:45.588
Yeah, I so wanted to show them up.

44:45.733 --> 44:48.167
That hardly counted.
They'd been planning that for weeks.

44:48.302 --> 44:51.203
Yeah, and now they're all walking around
thinking they're better than us.

44:51.338 --> 44:52.737
So not true.

44:52.873 --> 44:55.706
You know, I'd really like to see them
go up against us.

44:55.843 --> 44:56.901
Yeah.

44:57.044 --> 44:59.911
If we had time to get it together,
there's no way they'd stand a chance.

45:00.047 --> 45:01.446
Like in Final Jam.

45:01.582 --> 45:03.277
There's just no way.

45:03.851 --> 45:07.048
Lot of big talk. Wanna see if it's true?

45:15.996 --> 45:20.228
It's about time. My private vocal lessons
started ten minutes ago.

45:20.367 --> 45:22.232
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:22.803 --> 45:27.001
I forgot that Axel thinks
you need the extra rehearsal.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.132
<i>Camp Rock!</i>

45:31.011 --> 45:32.808
<i>Camp Rock!</i>

45:34.815 --> 45:36.840
<i>Camp Rock!</i>

45:38.585 --> 45:40.348
<i>Camp Rock!</i>

45:42.256 --> 45:43.314
<i>Camp Rock!</i>

45:46.593 --> 45:48.527
<i>Camp Rock!</i>

45:49.830 --> 45:52.025
<i>Camp Rock! Huh!</i>

45:52.566 --> 45:55.933
Yeah, that's right.
We're here on your stage.

45:56.069 --> 45:59.197
See, you guys didn't really give us
a chance to answer back the other night.

45:59.339 --> 46:01.864
But guess what. That's gonna change.

46:02.576 --> 46:06.808
Camp Rock vs. Camp Star, the Final Jam.
What do you guys think about that?

46:08.615 --> 46:09.673
Drums.

46:12.953 --> 46:14.045
A little guitar, please.

46:16.123 --> 46:17.283
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

46:17.758 --> 46:20.352
<i>I hope you're ready
For the time of your life</i>

46:20.961 --> 46:23.623
<i>Just look at me
I put a gleam in your eye</i>

46:24.364 --> 46:28.698
<i>Buckle up
We're gonna take you for a ride</i>

46:30.537 --> 46:33.768
<i>Let's go
We got you goin' good in the vibe</i>

46:33.907 --> 46:37.035
<i>- Everybody, put your hands to the sky
- Hands to the sky</i>

46:37.177 --> 46:41.238
<i>Buckle up
We're gonna take you, take you high</i>

46:41.381 --> 46:43.144
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

46:43.283 --> 46:46.081
<i>Show me, show me, show me, show me
Show what you got</i>

46:46.220 --> 46:49.417
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ready or not</i>

46:49.556 --> 46:52.218
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
Let me see how you bop</i>

46:52.359 --> 46:55.760
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

46:55.896 --> 46:58.660
<i>Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top</i>

46:59.099 --> 47:00.691
<i>'Cause, because
Because when we rock</i>

47:00.834 --> 47:02.233
<i>We let it rock</i>

47:02.369 --> 47:05.236
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
Dance till we drop</i>

47:05.372 --> 47:08.034
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

47:09.309 --> 47:11.106
<i>- Whoo
- Okay, now</i>

47:11.612 --> 47:13.477
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yeah</i>

47:13.614 --> 47:16.845
<i>One, two
One, two, three, four</i>

47:16.984 --> 47:20.351
<i>Show stoppin'
When I step in the place</i>

47:20.487 --> 47:22.785
<i>Before it's done
You're gonna beg me to stay</i>

47:22.923 --> 47:27.758
<i>Get onboard
Come on, let's ride the wave</i>

47:29.429 --> 47:32.956
<i>- Okay
- Let's go, let's go, we just do what we do</i>

47:33.100 --> 47:36.126
<i>Watch me break and pop
I'll pass it to you</i>

47:36.270 --> 47:40.570
<i>You wanna rock like us
'Cause we're never second place</i>

47:40.707 --> 47:42.231
<i>You ready, ready?</i>

47:42.376 --> 47:44.936
<i>Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show what you got</i>

47:45.546 --> 47:48.106
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ready or not</i>

47:48.715 --> 47:51.616
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
Let me see how you bop</i>

47:51.752 --> 47:54.915
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

47:55.055 --> 47:58.081
<i>Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top</i>

47:58.225 --> 47:59.817
<i>'Cause, because
Because when we rock</i>

47:59.960 --> 48:01.427
<i>We let it rock</i>

48:01.562 --> 48:04.292
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
Dance till we drop</i>

48:04.431 --> 48:07.958
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

48:09.436 --> 48:12.803
<i>Okay, now
Are you ready?</i>

48:12.940 --> 48:15.909
<i>One, two, one, two, three</i>

48:16.243 --> 48:19.474
<i>There, there, there, there
There is no competition</i>

48:19.613 --> 48:21.979
<i>That's why
We in the number-one position</i>

48:22.115 --> 48:25.607
<i>That crew can't hang with us
Man, we're too dangerous</i>

48:26.486 --> 48:28.613
<i>Ain't got the style or the stamina</i>

48:28.755 --> 48:31.781
<i>Just doin' my thing
Get hooked on my swing</i>

48:31.925 --> 48:35.452
<i>Rockin' the place, droppin' the bass
Making all the girls sing</i>

48:36.229 --> 48:38.993
<i>Yeah, we make the bells ring</i>

48:39.132 --> 48:41.657
<i>- It's on, it's on
- Drums</i>

48:44.338 --> 48:45.771
<i>Yeah</i>

48:45.906 --> 48:48.067
- Come on.
- Yeah.

48:50.911 --> 48:52.742
A little guitar, please.

48:52.879 --> 48:54.506
One, two, three, four.

49:00.087 --> 49:01.748
Yeah.

49:07.127 --> 49:10.187
<i>Show me, show me, show me, show me
Show what you got</i>

49:10.330 --> 49:13.390
<i>Come on, come on, come on
Come on, ready or not</i>

49:13.533 --> 49:16.229
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
Let me see how you bop</i>

49:16.370 --> 49:19.806
<i>- It's on, it's on, it's on
- Show me</i>

49:19.940 --> 49:22.966
<i>Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top</i>

49:23.110 --> 49:24.702
<i>'Cause, because
Because when we rock</i>

49:24.845 --> 49:26.244
<i>We let it rock</i>

49:26.380 --> 49:29.076
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
Dance till we drop</i>

49:29.216 --> 49:32.583
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

49:32.719 --> 49:35.779
<i>Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show what you got</i>

49:35.922 --> 49:38.948
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ready or not</i>

49:39.092 --> 49:41.822
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
Let me see how you bop</i>

49:41.962 --> 49:45.329
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

49:45.465 --> 49:48.195
<i>Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top</i>

49:48.802 --> 49:50.394
<i>'Cause, because
Because when we rock</i>

49:50.537 --> 49:52.004
<i>We let it rock</i>

49:52.139 --> 49:54.607
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
Dance till we drop</i>

49:54.741 --> 49:58.006
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

49:59.913 --> 50:03.280
<i>- It's on
- It's on, it's on</i>

50:03.417 --> 50:05.783
<i>- It's on
- Two, one, two, three</i>

50:05.919 --> 50:08.285
<i>It's on</i>

50:14.661 --> 50:17.357
That is a fantastic idea.

50:17.497 --> 50:20.591
Truly. I'm impressed.

50:20.734 --> 50:23.635
A little healthy competition
is exactly what we need.

50:23.770 --> 50:27.604
A champion always needs
a good sparring partner.

50:27.741 --> 50:28.935
We do?

50:29.676 --> 50:34.613
But you really think that
you can take my guys on head-to-head?

50:36.383 --> 50:38.442
- Any time, any place.
- Yup.

50:38.585 --> 50:40.109
- Yeah.
- Can't wait.

50:40.721 --> 50:42.313
Maybe use our amphitheatre.

50:42.456 --> 50:43.684
Doesn't matter where.

50:43.824 --> 50:46.122
We just know that Camp Rock is gonna
blow you guys away.

50:46.259 --> 50:48.284
- That's right.
- Straight up.

50:48.428 --> 50:50.794
I'm sure an audience
would be a better judge of that.

50:51.364 --> 50:54.162
Bring it on.
You can pack it with anybody you want.

50:56.903 --> 50:59.167
Well, how about a worldwide audience?

51:00.440 --> 51:02.738
What if we put this little competition
on TV?

51:03.810 --> 51:06.074
Have the public decide
who's really the best.

51:06.213 --> 51:08.807
TV? We'd really get to be on TV?

51:09.116 --> 51:11.346
Uh, I don't really know about this.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.146
Not such a big talker now, are you?

51:13.386 --> 51:14.785
Ooh.

51:14.921 --> 51:17.947
- But that would be so cool.
- The whole world would see us.

51:18.191 --> 51:19.749
Uh...

51:20.193 --> 51:22.787
Come on, Mitchie. This could be huge.

51:23.196 --> 51:25.187
Yeah, let's do it.

51:25.465 --> 51:26.762
You're on.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.094
- All right.
- Yeah.

51:38.678 --> 51:41.579
I wrote this song a long time ago
and I kind of forgot about it,

51:41.715 --> 51:43.342
but I think it could work.

51:45.385 --> 51:46.647
It's a duet.

51:46.787 --> 51:49.984
Now. But I think I could rewrite it
and make a part for everybody.

51:50.123 --> 51:52.182
Or we can rewrite it.

51:52.826 --> 51:56.023
"I lay pretty, pretty flowers
on your grave."

51:57.264 --> 51:59.960
Am I the only one who thinks this song is,
like, totally depressing?

52:00.100 --> 52:03.297
Ahem. You're on the wrong page.

52:03.436 --> 52:06.371
Yeah, that song
was for my hamster's funeral.

52:06.506 --> 52:08.167
Oh, this is perfect.

52:08.308 --> 52:10.367
The staging could be pretty cool.

52:10.510 --> 52:12.774
Yeah, it looks like there's some
great spots for dancing.

52:12.913 --> 52:14.380
And it's got a great groove.

52:14.514 --> 52:17.483
Well, before we get ahead of ourselves,
guys, I got a couple conditions.

52:17.617 --> 52:18.982
You've got conditions?

52:19.419 --> 52:21.887
Yes. Well, a condition.

52:22.022 --> 52:24.513
There has to be a spot
for my junior rockers.

52:24.658 --> 52:28.287
Of course. That's what this is all about.

52:28.428 --> 52:30.157
So, what do you guys think?

52:30.297 --> 52:32.197
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

52:32.332 --> 52:34.232
I think somebody should talk
to Uncle Brown.

52:35.001 --> 52:37.902
Why? I already know
what he's gonna say.

52:38.271 --> 52:40.796
How could she do that? I told them.

52:40.941 --> 52:45.378
I told Mitchie
Axel Turner cannot be trusted.

52:45.512 --> 52:48.072
I don't know why
you're getting so upset.

52:48.215 --> 52:51.343
At the very least, Camp Rock
could get some great exposure.

52:51.484 --> 52:53.577
He took advantage, is what he did.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.120
He saw an opportunity and went for it.

52:56.256 --> 53:00.056
An opportunity to destroy me
once and for all.

53:00.193 --> 53:02.457
And I thought Mitchie
could be dramatic.

53:02.596 --> 53:07.226
Okay, then, just call him and say no.
It's not that big a deal.

53:07.367 --> 53:09.028
Oh, we're well past big deal.

53:09.502 --> 53:12.266
Look. "Camp Wars." Catchy.

53:12.405 --> 53:17.104
Yeah, I especially like the tagline,
"Only one will survive."

53:17.577 --> 53:20.546
Millions of viewers will be watching.
That's good, right?

53:21.414 --> 53:26.579
After this, we are done.
And not just for the summer, for good.

53:27.587 --> 53:31.455
Oh, come on. Brown.

53:32.192 --> 53:33.921
Give them a chance.

53:34.060 --> 53:37.359
Look, nobody believes in
my rockers more than I do,

53:37.497 --> 53:40.466
but we are gonna look like a joke
next to Camp Star.

53:40.600 --> 53:44.798
We don't have the resources,
the infrastructure, the money.

53:44.938 --> 53:47.202
Talent, passion, commitment,
yeah, we've got that.

53:47.340 --> 53:48.739
It's not gonna matter.

53:48.875 --> 53:50.604
It always matters.

53:50.744 --> 53:52.211
And when people watch,

53:52.345 --> 53:55.439
where do you think
they're gonna send their kids to camp?

53:56.750 --> 54:00.015
- She didn't do it on purpose.
- I know.

54:00.153 --> 54:04.283
I just wish she wouldn't have
fallen into the trap.

54:19.773 --> 54:21.502
<i>Good morning, Camp Rock.</i>

54:21.641 --> 54:23.506
<i>A message from Mitchie Torres:</i>

54:23.643 --> 54:26.612
<i>All rockers, please report
to the main stage immediately.</i>

54:26.746 --> 54:29.977
<i>Yeah, that means you. Get moving.</i>

54:31.851 --> 54:34.649
All right, rockers. There are
new schedules out on the board.

54:34.788 --> 54:38.280
From this moment on, everything
is about winning the competition.

54:38.425 --> 54:40.620
Everything.
We have to be completely focused.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.557
What about swimming
and waterskiing and...?

54:42.696 --> 54:44.288
Focus. Sorry.

54:44.431 --> 54:46.524
Oh. Sorry again.

54:47.233 --> 54:49.497
Seriously, you guys,
if we wanna save this camp,

54:49.636 --> 54:51.797
we have to put
all of our energies into this

54:51.938 --> 54:55.271
and make it the best performance
that any of us have ever put on.

54:55.408 --> 54:58.172
I mean, we may have our doubters,
but we have come way too far

54:58.311 --> 54:59.903
just to back down. Agreed?

55:00.046 --> 55:01.308
Agreed.

55:01.448 --> 55:03.348
All right. Now, let's go get to work.

55:05.385 --> 55:06.750
Now.

55:16.529 --> 55:19.225
I don't know what to do about this set,
but it's just gotta be big.

55:19.366 --> 55:22.028
Think of the biggest thing you can imagine
and then make it bigger.

55:22.168 --> 55:23.999
- All right.
- Thanks.

55:24.904 --> 55:27.338
Mitchie, we're moving
in the wrong direction.

55:27.474 --> 55:29.908
There's even less time on this
than the last one.

55:30.043 --> 55:32.409
- I've got a few minutes now.
- That's not what I mean.

55:32.545 --> 55:33.773
Mitchie, can you look at this?

55:33.913 --> 55:36.404
I want us to coordinate,
but not be all matchy-matchy.

55:36.549 --> 55:38.244
- Mitchie... Hi, Shane.
- Hi.

55:38.385 --> 55:42.185
I know you're rewriting, but we've gotta
make some decisions about the music.

55:42.822 --> 55:44.016
Mitchie, can I talk to you?

55:44.157 --> 55:46.022
Do you know who's doing
the vocal arrangements?

55:46.159 --> 55:48.024
If it's me, fine,
but somebody's gotta tell me.

55:49.996 --> 55:51.691
I'm sorry.

56:08.148 --> 56:10.241
I don't even know why I'm here.

56:10.650 --> 56:12.880
Take my advice
and never get a girlfriend.

56:15.288 --> 56:17.518
I don't think that'll be a problem.

56:33.039 --> 56:35.769
Hey, what are you guys doing?
I thought you were gonna be rehearsing.

56:35.909 --> 56:39.470
Whoa, calm down.
We've been rehearsing for over five hours.

56:39.612 --> 56:40.977
We're just taking a little break.

56:41.114 --> 56:42.376
Really? Because I was watching,

56:42.515 --> 56:44.676
and it looks like we're gonna need
a lot more work.

56:48.521 --> 56:50.182
- You guys done already?
- No.

56:50.323 --> 56:53.850
He was just telling me this story
about his sister. It's hilarious. Tell her.

56:53.993 --> 56:56.723
The one about the group of kids
that didn't take their jobs seriously

56:56.863 --> 56:58.057
and then the camp shut down?

56:58.198 --> 57:00.132
Yeah, I think I've heard it.

57:00.266 --> 57:03.133
Hey, Mitchie. You gotta check out this bit
me and the J.R.'s worked out.

57:03.269 --> 57:04.964
It's a real spotlight moment.

57:05.105 --> 57:06.629
That's great. I'm sure whatever it is,

57:06.773 --> 57:09.606
it's just gonna have to be
more of a background moment.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.001
Sander, what's going on?

57:13.146 --> 57:16.206
You guys haven't made any progress
since I left like half an hour ago.

57:16.349 --> 57:20.945
You guys have to get this thing built.
You guys have to work with me.

57:21.621 --> 57:24.181
If I wanted to go to Camp Star
I would have signed up.

57:24.324 --> 57:25.916
Okay, that's not fair.

57:26.059 --> 57:28.550
I'm just trying to get stuff done,
but if you guys don't care...

57:28.695 --> 57:30.060
Mitchie.

57:30.396 --> 57:32.830
We all care, but you gotta lighten up.

57:33.566 --> 57:37.002
Really? And what will that get us?

57:39.772 --> 57:41.797
All right, okay. Let's do it again.

57:41.941 --> 57:45.433
That girl is taking the F-U-N
out of summer.

57:45.578 --> 57:47.341
There is no F-U-N in "summer."

57:47.480 --> 57:49.505
- Exactly.
- Seriously,

57:49.649 --> 57:52.243
I love her, but I'm gonna kill her.

57:57.056 --> 58:00.685
Okay, I think you know
what you've gotta do.

58:00.827 --> 58:02.419
I'm on it.

58:06.032 --> 58:08.830
Guys, guys, calm down.

58:08.968 --> 58:11.368
She didn't say no,
she said she'd think about it.

58:14.040 --> 58:17.669
All work and no spray
makes a very unhappy rocker.

58:17.810 --> 58:21.940
So I got a proposition for you guys.
You think you're up for it?

58:24.083 --> 58:29.214
Okay, we have a ton of stuff to go over.
Where is everybody?

58:30.123 --> 58:32.557
Seriously, people have got to start
being on time.

58:34.494 --> 58:36.121
Attack!

59:06.292 --> 59:08.886
Oh, this was not on the schedule.

59:11.798 --> 59:16.030
Are you kidding?
This is what summer camp is all about.

59:16.169 --> 59:18.433
Counterattack!

59:22.275 --> 59:24.266
Oh, ho!

59:27.447 --> 59:28.880
Come on! Ha, ha!

59:32.485 --> 59:34.749
Come on, then.

59:37.724 --> 59:39.282
- I know.
- It's so high.

59:39.425 --> 59:41.791
- Look at that.
- That's a lot of fire there.

59:41.928 --> 59:43.828
- So fun today.
- Today was so awesome.

59:43.963 --> 59:46.523
- Yeah.
- Has anybody seen Mitchie?

59:46.666 --> 59:49.260
Um, I don't know. She missed dinner.

59:50.870 --> 59:52.462
Okay, thanks.

59:53.539 --> 59:55.530
Look at our fire.

01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:04.940
Your sheet music's soggy.

01:00:05.084 --> 01:00:07.177
Just pouring myself into my music.

01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:12.057
- That was bad.
- Yeah, I know. Um...

01:00:12.492 --> 01:00:15.723
- Are you here to help?
- I can't.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:17.590
Why?

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:20.290
Because you and I are going
on a moonlight picnic.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.801
- Now?
- Right now.

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:25.998
- How could you...
- Because I'm that nice of a guy.

01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:28.403
think that I would just go running off?

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.667
Are you saying no?

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:32.243
Do you not understand
everything that needs to get done?

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.312
How could I not?
You remind me every two seconds.

01:00:34.447 --> 01:00:36.847
And the water-balloon fight.
I mean, what were you thinking?

01:00:36.983 --> 01:00:39.315
I was thinking,
"Wouldn't it be nice to have a little fun?"

01:00:39.452 --> 01:00:40.851
So you're saying I'm not fun?

01:00:41.621 --> 01:00:44.647
Why do I even keep trying?
The whole reason I came was because...

01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:46.520
I know. It was to get to know me better.

01:00:46.659 --> 01:00:49.924
Well, guess what. This is me
trying to save something that I care about.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.998
- So am I.
- Really? How's that working out for you?

01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:55.060
Not so great.

01:00:59.272 --> 01:01:00.762
Shane.

01:01:03.509 --> 01:01:04.908
You forgot your flashlight.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:42.680
<i>It's like he doesn't hear a word I say</i>

01:01:42.815 --> 01:01:47.013
<i>His mind is somewhere far away</i>

01:01:47.153 --> 01:01:49.815
<i>And I don't know how to get there</i>

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:53.756
<i>- It's like all he wants is to chill out
- She's way too serious</i>

01:01:53.893 --> 01:01:58.330
<i>- He makes me wanna pull all my hair out
- She's always in a rush and interrupting</i>

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:01.194
<i>- Like he doesn't even care
- Like she doesn't even care</i>

01:02:01.334 --> 01:02:02.767
<i>- You
- Me</i>

01:02:02.902 --> 01:02:03.960
<i>We're face to face</i>

01:02:04.103 --> 01:02:06.594
<i>- But we don't see eye to eye
- But we don't see eye to eye</i>

01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:09.264
<i>- Like fire and rain
- Like fire and rain</i>

01:02:09.409 --> 01:02:12.105
<i>- You can drive me insane
- You can drive me insane</i>

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:17.512
<i>- But I can't stay mad at you for anything
- But I can't stay mad at you for anything</i>

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.448
<i>- We're Venus and Mars
- We're Venus and Mars</i>

01:02:20.586 --> 01:02:23.180
<i>- We're like different stars
- Like different stars</i>

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:28.453
<i>But you're the harmony
To every song I sing</i>

01:02:28.594 --> 01:02:34.328
<i>- And I wouldn't change a thing
- And I wouldn't change a thing</i>

01:02:35.435 --> 01:02:38.029
<i>She's always tryin' to save the day</i>

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.833
<i>Just wanna let my music play</i>

01:02:40.973 --> 01:02:45.910
<i>She's all or nothing
But my feelings never change</i>

01:02:46.045 --> 01:02:49.537
<i>- Why does he try to read my mind?
- I try to read her mind</i>

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:53.880
<i>- It's not good to psychoanalyze
- She tries to pick a fight to get attention</i>

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.046
<i>- It's what all of my friends say
- It's what all of my friends say</i>

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.316
<i>- You
- Me</i>

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:02.394
<i>We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye</i>

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:05.292
<i>- Like fire and rain
- Like fire and rain</i>

01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:07.922
<i>- You can drive me insane
- You can drive me insane</i>

01:03:08.067 --> 01:03:13.334
<i>- But I can't stay mad at you for anything
- But I can't stay mad at you for anything</i>

01:03:13.473 --> 01:03:16.203
<i>- We're Venus and Mars
- We're Venus and Mars</i>

01:03:16.342 --> 01:03:19.140
<i>- We're like different stars
- Like different stars</i>

01:03:19.278 --> 01:03:24.545
<i>You're the harmony
To every song I sing</i>

01:03:24.684 --> 01:03:29.849
<i>- And I wouldn't change a thing
- And I wouldn't change a thing</i>

01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:33.582
<i>When I'm yes, she's no</i>

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.494
<i>When I hold on he just lets go</i>

01:03:39.665 --> 01:03:42.498
<i>- We're perfectly imperfect
- We're perfectly imperfect</i>

01:03:42.635 --> 01:03:48.835
<i>- But I wouldn't change a thing, no
- But I wouldn't change a thing, no</i>

01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:52.769
<i>- We're like fire and rain
- Like fire and rain</i>

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:55.244
<i>- You can drive me insane
- You can drive me insane</i>

01:03:55.381 --> 01:04:00.751
<i>- But I can't stay mad at you for anything
- But I can't stay mad at you for anything</i>

01:04:00.887 --> 01:04:03.981
<i>- We're Venus and Mars
- We're Venus and Mars</i>

01:04:04.123 --> 01:04:06.489
<i>- We're like different stars
- Like different stars</i>

01:04:06.626 --> 01:04:11.689
<i>But you're the harmony
To every song I sing</i>

01:04:12.131 --> 01:04:20.334
<i>- And I wouldn't change a thing
- And I wouldn't change a thing</i>

01:04:20.473 --> 01:04:25.911
<i>- But I can't stay mad at you for anything
- But I can't stay mad at you for anything</i>

01:04:26.045 --> 01:04:29.037
<i>- We're Venus and Mars
- We're Venus and Mars</i>

01:04:29.181 --> 01:04:31.809
<i>- We're like different stars
- Like different stars</i>

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:37.116
<i>But you're the harmony
To every song I sing</i>

01:04:37.256 --> 01:04:40.487
<i>- And I wouldn't change a
- And I wouldn't change a</i>

01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:46.656
<i>- Wouldn't change a thing
- Wouldn't change a thing</i>

01:05:13.526 --> 01:05:15.357
Where is everybody?

01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:33.174
All right, now let's all look
at the alto harmony on measure 15.

01:05:33.312 --> 01:05:35.439
There's a four-bar rest.

01:05:36.248 --> 01:05:39.217
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:05:40.219 --> 01:05:42.687
- Oh, hold on.
- What's going on?

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.219
You were right.
It shouldn't be all up to you.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.089
And we do need to step it up.

01:05:49.228 --> 01:05:51.696
Shane got everybody up before dawn.

01:05:51.831 --> 01:05:54.527
He can be pretty persuasive
when he wants to be.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.400
Morning. Sleep well?

01:05:59.605 --> 01:06:01.698
I don't think you got
the new arrangement yet.

01:06:02.174 --> 01:06:04.108
Needed a lot of work.

01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:06.841
You did this?

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.841
- We all did.
- Yeah.

01:06:11.283 --> 01:06:13.683
I already know I'm gonna love it.

01:06:14.186 --> 01:06:16.677
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:06:16.822 --> 01:06:19.484
All right, let's get started.

01:06:20.426 --> 01:06:22.656
We gotta rock this stage
like we own it, right?

01:06:24.196 --> 01:06:27.165
Now, I can hear you,
but I gotta see you play.

01:06:27.299 --> 01:06:29.790
- Nate, show them how it's done.
- Like this.

01:06:33.205 --> 01:06:34.399
Excellent.

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:35.905
Jason, show them how to rock.

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:38.237
Okay, guys, not like this:
But like this:

01:06:43.049 --> 01:06:44.448
Good job.

01:06:45.384 --> 01:06:48.615
Well, it's easy for you guys,
but we're not all rock stars.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:49.846
But you can be.

01:06:53.459 --> 01:06:55.051
<i>Oh</i>

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.760
<i>Yeah</i>

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:02.165
<i>All right</i>

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:06.299
<i>Mm-hm-hm</i>

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.769
<i>Gather round, guys
It's time to start listenin'</i>

01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:15.074
<i>Practice makes perfect
But perfect's not workin'</i>

01:07:15.214 --> 01:07:19.947
<i>There's a lot more to music
Than knowing where your cue's gonna be</i>

01:07:22.354 --> 01:07:27.087
<i>You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you're moving me</i>

01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:32.657
<i>But if you can jump like David Lee Roth</i>

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:36.063
<i>Or pump your fist
Like you're Bruce the Boss</i>

01:07:36.202 --> 01:07:39.262
<i>If you got heart and soul</i>

01:07:39.405 --> 01:07:41.930
<i>You can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.603
<i>Rock 'n' roll</i>

01:07:48.247 --> 01:07:51.478
<i>Strum it, drum it
Slide across and run it</i>

01:07:51.617 --> 01:07:54.677
<i>The stage is your home
If you learn how to own it</i>

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.254
<i>Like the greats did</i>

01:07:57.389 --> 01:07:59.949
<i>There's no way that you can fake it</i>

01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:04.821
<i>You've gotta feel the beat
Before you can move</i>

01:08:05.364 --> 01:08:08.265
<i>Even though you're not wearing
Blue suede shoes</i>

01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:12.233
<i>And makin' mistakes
Well, that won't matter</i>

01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:15.670
<i>If you can swagger
Like you're Mick Jagger</i>

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:19.268
<i>If you've got heart and soul</i>

01:08:19.411 --> 01:08:21.470
<i>You can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:08:22.948 --> 01:08:25.279
<i>You can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:27.215
<i>Whoo, solo</i>

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.227
<i>If you live and die for the music inside</i>

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.895
<i>If the one-four-five never gets old</i>

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.167
<i>Then you can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:08:52.444 --> 01:08:54.173
<i>Rock 'n' roll</i>

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:57.508
<i>All right, now, take it low</i>

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.182
<i>Now, I need the spotlight
To hit me right here</i>

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.318
<i>As the crowd starts to cheer</i>

01:09:03.788 --> 01:09:07.156
<i>I need the fan to blow
Right through my rock-star hair</i>

01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:10.151
<i>Right here</i>

01:09:10.296 --> 01:09:13.560
<i>If you can scream like Axl Rose</i>

01:09:13.698 --> 01:09:17.260
<i>Or sing like Christina show after show</i>

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:20.429
<i>If you've got heart and soul</i>

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:24.407
<i>- You can rock 'n' roll
- Yeah</i>

01:09:24.542 --> 01:09:27.706
<i>If you've got heart and soul</i>

01:09:27.846 --> 01:09:29.872
<i>You can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:33.442
<i>You can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.147
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.563
<i>You can rock 'n' roll</i>

01:09:55.507 --> 01:09:56.633
<i>Oh</i>

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:01.341
<i>Yeah</i>

01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:04.615
<i>All right</i>

01:10:05.551 --> 01:10:06.950
- Hi, Nate.
- Whoa!

01:10:07.086 --> 01:10:08.986
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

01:10:10.256 --> 01:10:11.484
Hi, Dana.

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.656
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

01:10:15.361 --> 01:10:17.955
- You came to see me?
- Good guess.

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.429
Well, here I am.

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:25.626
Heh. That's it?

01:10:26.272 --> 01:10:29.537
I came all the way over here in a canoe
risking my father's wrath,

01:10:29.675 --> 01:10:33.509
and that's all you have to say to me?

01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:36.306
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to say.

01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:39.047
There's nothing you're supposed to say.

01:10:39.184 --> 01:10:41.584
Every day I see you looking and waving
and I'm all,

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.847
"That's so sweet. I so like him."

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:46.583
You do? Really, that's what you say?

01:10:46.926 --> 01:10:49.360
- But then...
- "But then"?

01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:51.891
That's never good.

01:10:52.097 --> 01:10:54.327
How do I really know
if I don't know anything about you?

01:10:56.268 --> 01:10:58.964
- I guess I just thought you were different.
- I am different.

01:10:59.104 --> 01:11:00.969
No, you're not.

01:11:01.106 --> 01:11:04.132
You're exactly like
every other teenage boy in the world.

01:11:04.276 --> 01:11:06.836
Have you ever told me anything
about yourself?

01:11:06.979 --> 01:11:08.844
You know, other than you like canoeing.

01:11:09.648 --> 01:11:12.446
Well, I don't really like canoeing.

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:18.319
Oh. Oh, good.
So I really know nothing about you.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.287
I still don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

01:11:27.066 --> 01:11:28.829
I think you just did.

01:11:34.473 --> 01:11:36.338
<i>Words don't come easy</i>

01:11:36.475 --> 01:11:37.635
Idiot.

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:40.904
<i>Without a melody</i>

01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:44.106
<i>I'm always thinkin'</i>

01:11:44.249 --> 01:11:47.275
<i>In terms of do-re-mi</i>

01:11:47.419 --> 01:11:54.291
<i>I should be hikin', swimmin'
Laughin' with you</i>

01:11:55.294 --> 01:11:58.263
<i>Instead I'm all out of tune</i>

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.092
Special order.

01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:02.632
<i>But what you don't know</i>

01:12:02.768 --> 01:12:05.362
<i>You lift me off of the ground</i>

01:12:05.504 --> 01:12:07.870
<i>Your inspiration</i>

01:12:08.007 --> 01:12:10.601
<i>You help me find my sound</i>

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.871
<i>Just like a bass line in half time</i>

01:12:14.013 --> 01:12:16.447
<i>You hold down the groove</i>

01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:20.381
<i>That's why I'm countin' on you</i>

01:12:22.054 --> 01:12:26.616
<i>- And when I hear you on the radio
- And when I hear you on the radio</i>

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:30.718
<i>- I never want to change a single note
- I never want to change a single note</i>

01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:35.990
<i>- It's what I tried to say all along
- It's what I tried to say all along</i>

01:12:36.135 --> 01:12:39.935
<i>- You're my favorite song
- You're my favorite song</i>

01:12:40.072 --> 01:12:41.334
<i>My favorite song</i>

01:12:41.473 --> 01:12:45.739
<i>- And when I hear you on the radio
- And when I hear you on the radio, yeah</i>

01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:49.837
<i>- I never want to change a single note
- I never want to change a single note</i>

01:12:49.982 --> 01:12:51.040
<i>No, no</i>

01:12:51.183 --> 01:12:55.142
<i>It's what I tried to say all along</i>

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:59.223
<i>You're my favorite song</i>

01:13:00.192 --> 01:13:04.094
<i>You're my favorite song</i>

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.768
I take back what I said about girlfriends.

01:13:13.906 --> 01:13:16.534
It's all good, because at this rate,
I'll never have one.

01:13:16.675 --> 01:13:17.767
What do you mean?

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:21.937
- Well, there's this girl.
- I kind of figured.

01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:26.647
I really like her, but I'm having a hard time
telling her how I really feel.

01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:29.618
You're a rock star, dude. Use it.

01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:31.553
I don't think she cares.

01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:34.682
She just wants to know all this stupid,
random stuff about me.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.759
It's not random stuff.

01:13:36.895 --> 01:13:40.194
She just wants to know you care enough
to let her know who you are.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.031
Well, I care.

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:44.999
But I just don't know how to say it.

01:13:45.437 --> 01:13:49.635
Well, if you can't say it, you can sing it.

01:14:09.495 --> 01:14:11.986
Every single time
I'm trying to sing my high note,

01:14:12.131 --> 01:14:13.996
I keep getting lost behind her big head.

01:14:14.133 --> 01:14:16.397
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- You couldn't stand the spotlight.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.594
Now that you mention,
I'm not trying to do anything.

01:14:18.737 --> 01:14:19.863
Enough.

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:22.397
We'll run it again in three minutes.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:25.977
And this time, remember,
it's not amateur hour.

01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:28.071
He means you.

01:14:32.784 --> 01:14:33.842
- Hi, Dana.
- Ah!

01:14:34.686 --> 01:14:36.779
Kind of makes you jump, doesn't it?

01:14:37.656 --> 01:14:40.420
- You shouldn't be here.
- I know, but I couldn't wait.

01:14:41.426 --> 01:14:43.223
Wait for what?

01:14:44.463 --> 01:14:47.432
It's a list of things
that nobody knows about me.

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:50.095
Two minutes.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:52.431
I really gotta go. I'm sorry.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.562
Wait. We still have two minutes.

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.166
Okay.

01:15:03.015 --> 01:15:06.246
<i>I'm, I'm good at wasting time</i>

01:15:06.385 --> 01:15:08.182
<i>I think lyrics need to rhyme</i>

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.188
<i>And you're not askin'
But I'm tryin' to grow a mustache</i>

01:15:12.324 --> 01:15:16.556
<i>I eat cheese
But only on pizza, please</i>

01:15:16.695 --> 01:15:20.096
<i>And sometimes
On a homemade quesadilla</i>

01:15:20.232 --> 01:15:22.962
<i>Otherwise it smells like feet to me</i>

01:15:23.101 --> 01:15:27.800
<i>And I, I really like it
When the moon looks like a toenail</i>

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:33.606
<i>And I love it when you say my name</i>

01:15:33.745 --> 01:15:35.713
Places, everybody. Come on.

01:15:35.847 --> 01:15:37.246
<i>If you wanna know, here it goes</i>

01:15:37.382 --> 01:15:39.816
<i>Gonna tell you there's a part of me
That shows if we're close</i>

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.944
<i>Gonna let you see everything</i>

01:15:43.088 --> 01:15:45.352
<i>But remember that you asked for it</i>

01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:47.390
<i>I'll try to do my best to impress</i>

01:15:47.526 --> 01:15:49.858
<i>But it's easier to let you take a guess
At the rest</i>

01:15:49.995 --> 01:15:53.954
<i>But you wanna hear
What lives in my brain and my heart</i>

01:15:54.099 --> 01:15:55.760
<i>Well, you asked for it</i>

01:15:55.901 --> 01:16:03.069
<i>For your perusing, at times confusing
Slightly amusing</i>

01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:06.439
<i>Introducing me</i>

01:16:06.578 --> 01:16:08.773

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.218
<i>La-da, da-da</i>

01:16:13.685 --> 01:16:16.950
<i>La-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da</i>

01:16:17.089 --> 01:16:20.286
Come on,
get a move on. We don't have all day.

01:16:20.425 --> 01:16:23.417
<i>I never trust a dog to watch my food</i>

01:16:23.562 --> 01:16:28.522
<i>And I like to use the word "dude"
As a noun or an adverb or an adjective</i>

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:31.864
<i>And I, I never really been into cars</i>

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.235
<i>I like really cool guitars
And superheroes</i>

01:16:35.374 --> 01:16:37.808
<i>And checks with lots of zeros on 'em</i>

01:16:37.943 --> 01:16:41.504
<i>I love the sound of violins</i>

01:16:41.647 --> 01:16:47.085
<i>And makin' someone smile</i>

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.782

More than you ever wanted to</i>

01:17:17.516 --> 01:17:22.317
<i>So be careful when you ask next time</i>

01:17:22.454 --> 01:17:23.819
Dana.

01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:25.547

Dana. Everyone's waiting.

01:18:04.062 --> 01:18:05.552
Sorry. It's my fault.

01:18:05.697 --> 01:18:08.860
Why don't you save the theatrics
for the competition?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.436
It's okay. Go.

01:18:13.705 --> 01:18:15.297
Thank you.

01:18:16.074 --> 01:18:18.099
We'll talk about this later.

01:18:29.888 --> 01:18:32.982
And all that was left

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:36.151
was a bloody footprint.

01:18:37.696 --> 01:18:40.494
- Lame.
- Not even scary.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:44.595
Yeah, totally not scary at all.
Okay, time for bed. Turn on the lights.

01:18:44.736 --> 01:18:48.001
- But you called "lights out."
- I know what I called.

01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:51.734
What was that?

01:18:57.482 --> 01:19:00.815
- Jason, do you think we're gonna win?
- Yeah, Jason.

01:19:00.952 --> 01:19:02.681
Yeah, do you think we're gonna win?

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:05.483
Of course we're gonna win.
You guys are rock stars.

01:19:06.391 --> 01:19:08.018
But what if they are too?

01:19:10.929 --> 01:19:13.295
I guess I really didn't think about that.

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.225
Good night.

01:19:26.745 --> 01:19:27.939
Everybody up.

01:19:28.547 --> 01:19:29.912
Shh.

01:19:30.048 --> 01:19:31.640
Follow my lead.

01:19:31.783 --> 01:19:33.842
We're on a mission.

01:19:39.724 --> 01:19:42.625
Okay, guys, stay low. Roll.

01:19:42.761 --> 01:19:46.458
Oh, a rock. Ow, ow, ow! Oh!
Okay. Don't roll.

01:19:46.598 --> 01:19:51.797
Okay, gently, guys. Come on, carefully.
Single file. Slow. Careful.

01:19:52.003 --> 01:19:53.595
Come on. Shh.

01:19:53.738 --> 01:19:55.831
Guys, come on.

01:20:02.013 --> 01:20:03.640
Go, go.

01:20:13.592 --> 01:20:17.494
<i>You can play a song
Almost any groove</i>

01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:20.063
<i>We can break it down
Break it down</i>

01:20:21.166 --> 01:20:22.190
<i>Hey</i>

01:20:22.334 --> 01:20:26.395
<i>You can play a song
When you see me move</i>

01:20:26.538 --> 01:20:28.938
<i>Make you turn around
Turn around</i>

01:20:30.141 --> 01:20:31.335
<i>Oh-ooh-oh</i>

01:20:31.476 --> 01:20:36.504
<i>I know you
Are checkin' on me</i>

01:20:36.648 --> 01:20:39.742
<i>I should be checkin' on you
Oh</i>

01:20:39.885 --> 01:20:41.750
<i>Give me the green light
I'm ready to go</i>

01:20:41.887 --> 01:20:44.355
<i>Here at the start line
I'm breaking the rope</i>

01:20:44.489 --> 01:20:46.218
<i>- I'm gonna take you
- I'm gonna shake you</i>

01:20:46.358 --> 01:20:48.758
<i>- No one's gonna lose
- Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:20:48.894 --> 01:20:50.919
<i>Won't stop at the red light
I'm on a roll</i>

01:20:51.062 --> 01:20:52.927
<i>Turn up the music
I'm out of control</i>

01:20:53.064 --> 01:20:54.861
<i>- I'm gonna take you
- I'm gonna shake you</i>

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.434
<i>- No one's gonna lose
- Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:20:57.569 --> 01:21:01.335
<i>When the lights come on
You can feel the heat</i>

01:21:01.473 --> 01:21:03.373
<i>Then I'll hit the floor, hit the floor</i>

01:21:03.508 --> 01:21:04.566
<i>Ooh</i>

01:21:06.044 --> 01:21:10.037
<i>When the curtain's up
I fly on my feet</i>

01:21:10.181 --> 01:21:13.582
<i>You'll be wantin' more
Wantin' more, ohhh</i>

01:21:13.718 --> 01:21:14.776
<i>Oh-ooh-oh</i>

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.381
<i>I know you
Are checkin' on me</i>

01:21:20.525 --> 01:21:23.517
<i>I should be checkin' on you
Oh</i>

01:21:23.662 --> 01:21:25.289
<i>Give me the green light
I'm ready to go</i>

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:27.625
<i>Here at the start line
I'm breaking the rope</i>

01:21:27.766 --> 01:21:29.757
<i>- I'm gonna take you
- I'm gonna shake you</i>

01:21:29.901 --> 01:21:31.801
<i>- No one's gonna lose
- Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:21:31.937 --> 01:21:34.201
<i>Won't stop at the red light
I'm on a roll</i>

01:21:34.339 --> 01:21:36.398
<i>Turn up the music
I'm out of control</i>

01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:38.406
<i>- I'm gonna take you
- I'm gonna shake you</i>

01:21:38.543 --> 01:21:41.068
<i>- No one's gonna lose
- Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:21:42.113 --> 01:21:44.377
<i>- Walkin' in my shoes
- Yeah</i>

01:21:46.585 --> 01:21:48.177
<i>Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:21:50.722 --> 01:21:54.123
<i>- Give me the green light
- I'm ready to go</i>

01:21:55.126 --> 01:21:58.527
<i>No one's gonna lose
Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:00.631
<i>Give me the green light
I'm ready to go</i>

01:22:00.765 --> 01:22:02.630
<i>Here at the start line
I'm breaking the rope</i>

01:22:02.767 --> 01:22:04.598
<i>- I'm gonna take you
- I'm gonna shake you</i>

01:22:04.736 --> 01:22:07.170
<i>- No one's gonna lose
- Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:22:07.305 --> 01:22:09.273
<i>Won't stop at the red light
I'm on a roll</i>

01:22:09.407 --> 01:22:11.170
<i>Turn up the music
I'm out of control</i>

01:22:11.309 --> 01:22:13.277
<i>- I'm gonna take you
- I'm gonna shake you</i>

01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:15.538
<i>- No one's gonna lose
- Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:22:17.816 --> 01:22:19.374
Go, go, go.

01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:22.418
<i>Walkin' in my shoes</i>

01:22:23.488 --> 01:22:24.921
<i>Hey</i>

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:28.690
- Well?
- Good.

01:22:29.294 --> 01:22:33.492
Maybe great.
But this competition isn't about maybe.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:36.333
Okay, fine.
But can you tell her to stay out of my light?

01:22:36.468 --> 01:22:40.234
Well, maybe if you would stay
out of my way, it wouldn't be a problem.

01:22:40.505 --> 01:22:42.530
Let me see "Tear it Down" instead.

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:47.174
Let's reset, people. Come on. Move!

01:22:47.612 --> 01:22:50.172
This has to be perfect.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.813
Camp Rock isn't gonna know
what hit them.

01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:02.549
- And the stage was, like, super-cool.
- It's huge.

01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:06.762
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.
Wait, so it's just Tess and Luke singing?

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:10.561
Yeah, pretty much. Everybody else is doing
something, but they're definitely the stars.

01:23:10.969 --> 01:23:14.405
But this makes it so much easier.
We could totally win this thing.

01:23:14.973 --> 01:23:17.601
- How so?
- Oh, come on. Even I get it.

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.107
I don't care what they're singing,

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.610
but you and Shane are better
than Tess and Luke any day.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.480
But Shane and I
aren't even singing together.

01:23:24.616 --> 01:23:26.880
But you originally
wrote the song as a duet.

01:23:27.018 --> 01:23:30.215
- I know, but I...
- You're our two strongest singers.

01:23:30.355 --> 01:23:32.323
And we know you have chemistry.

01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:35.687
It's just, everybody worked so hard.

01:23:35.827 --> 01:23:37.158
Yeah, to help save the camp.

01:23:37.295 --> 01:23:41.129
If the two of you singing alone on-stage
can help us win, you have to do it.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:42.426
Then it's settled.

01:24:00.518 --> 01:24:02.486
Remember when Audrey
jumped on Jason?

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.884
Man, the shaving cream
was the best one.

01:24:08.827 --> 01:24:12.092
You guys okay
with just Shane and I singing?

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:15.961
Yeah, we're good. I was just looking
forward to doing some of my new moves.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:19.626
But it's okay, if it means we get
to come back here next summer.

01:24:20.004 --> 01:24:22.871
- You guys had a good summer?
- Only the best summer ever.

01:24:38.456 --> 01:24:40.788
You guys just gave me
the best idea ever.

01:24:41.693 --> 01:24:44.025
- Thank you.
- Ew! Gross!

01:24:45.029 --> 01:24:48.726
Hey, guys, new plan.
Everyone meet in ten minutes.

01:24:50.201 --> 01:24:53.034
<i>Hello, and welcome to Hitz TV.
I'm Georgina Farlow.</i>

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.540
And today we're bringing you Camp Wars,
the ultimate summer-camp showdown.

01:24:57.675 --> 01:25:00.473
Now, there can be only one winner
this Final Jam,

01:25:00.612 --> 01:25:02.580
and your votes
are gonna help us decide.

01:25:02.714 --> 01:25:04.807
Just call or text in
after each performance...

01:25:04.949 --> 01:25:06.917
Kids, make sure
to have your parents' permission.

01:25:07.051 --> 01:25:11.351
- and let us know who you think sang out
and who you think hit a wrong note.

01:25:11.489 --> 01:25:15.186
What's your favorite camp,
Camp Star or Camp Rock?

01:25:15.326 --> 01:25:17.658
- And we're out.
- Okay.

01:25:18.062 --> 01:25:20.292
Georgina.

01:25:20.999 --> 01:25:25.026
- It's great to see you.
- As always, Axel.

01:25:25.603 --> 01:25:28.663
Well, I'm gonna go backstage
and do some standups before the concert.

01:25:28.807 --> 01:25:30.968
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:33.543
All right, let's go get
some interviews backstage

01:25:33.678 --> 01:25:34.872
with some of the campers.

01:25:35.013 --> 01:25:38.039
- You, uh, know her?
- No, I know everyone.

01:25:38.183 --> 01:25:41.710
But don't worry, she doesn't have
anything to do with the voting.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.114
Oh.

01:25:43.254 --> 01:25:47.452
So I probably shouldn't hold out hope
for us ever being friends again?

01:25:48.326 --> 01:25:49.953
Probably not.

01:25:50.295 --> 01:25:54.459
Though you never know, next year
I might hire you to run my summer camp.

01:25:56.467 --> 01:25:57.866
Thanks.

01:25:58.336 --> 01:25:59.735
But I'm already booked.

01:26:05.343 --> 01:26:06.503
Good luck.

01:26:06.644 --> 01:26:09.044
I'll be lucky if you don't
forget your words this time.

01:26:09.681 --> 01:26:12.878
By "good luck" I mean
"I hope you fall off the stage."

01:26:23.127 --> 01:26:26.654
As the sun goes down,
the volume goes up.

01:26:26.798 --> 01:26:29.596
Welcome back to the ultimate
summer-camp showdown,

01:26:29.734 --> 01:26:33.261
where you decide the winner.

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:40.070
<i>Now, first up is Camp Star.</i>

01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:42.338
Now, Camp Star
was founded only this year

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.473
by superstar producer and founder
of Star Records, Axel Turner,

01:26:50.488 --> 01:26:52.718
<i>who's been producing
for over 20 years.</i>

01:26:52.857 --> 01:26:57.191
<i>Now, I know if I was gonna study music,
this is the place I'd wanna be.</i>

01:26:57.762 --> 01:26:59.992
- Why is she saying that?
- It's her job.

01:27:00.131 --> 01:27:02.395
She's supposed to say nice things.

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:06.532
If she doesn't stop talking,
I think I'm gonna throw up.

01:27:06.671 --> 01:27:07.831
Too late.

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:14.068
Well, there's no turning back now,
because the party has already started.

01:27:14.412 --> 01:27:16.141
Camp Star, everybody.

01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:24.680
<i>Tear it down</i>

01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:27.450
Yo, Luke,
I need you to do something for me.

01:27:27.592 --> 01:27:30.356
<i>I was ready for this
Since I was cradlin'</i>

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:32.963
<i>Put my name on the list
You won't be gamblin'</i>

01:27:33.097 --> 01:27:35.497
<i>Not gonna leave with just this
We takin' everything</i>

01:27:35.633 --> 01:27:37.931
<i>Confidence, compliments
I bet you see it's evident</i>

01:27:38.069 --> 01:27:40.697
<i>Catch me if you can
I'm like a bandit</i>

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:43.136
<i>I can float on my feet
You can't stand it</i>

01:27:43.274 --> 01:27:45.606
<i>I don't just dance in a group
I command it</i>

01:27:45.777 --> 01:27:48.041
<i>We'll give you more than
You want and you can handle</i>

01:27:48.179 --> 01:27:50.579
<i>When we're out on the floor
We'll take over the ball</i>

01:27:50.715 --> 01:27:53.183
<i>Stealin' the show
We're gonna leave you in awe</i>

01:27:53.318 --> 01:27:55.809
<i>When we're comin' up
When we're comin' up</i>

01:27:55.954 --> 01:27:58.354
<i>We gonna tear it down</i>

01:27:58.489 --> 01:28:02.016
<i>You can't stop us now
You can't shut us down</i>

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.025
<i>You can't top the sound</i>

01:28:04.329 --> 01:28:05.853
<i>Better get ready now</i>

01:28:05.997 --> 01:28:08.363
<i>We're gonna tear it down</i>

01:28:08.499 --> 01:28:13.493
<i>The looks, we got 'em
The moves, we got 'em</i>

01:28:13.638 --> 01:28:16.471
<i>The style, we got it</i>

01:28:16.607 --> 01:28:18.973
<i>We gonna tear it down</i>

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:23.547
<i>The love, we got it
The crowd, we own it</i>

01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:26.582
<i>Tonight, we run it</i>

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:29.084
<i>We gonna tear it down</i>

01:28:29.654 --> 01:28:31.349
<i>Ooh</i>

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:35.082
<i>- We gonna tear it down
- Yes, yes, yes</i>

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:37.421
<i>Them no want to contest we</i>

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:39.587
<i>Recognize we the best that can be</i>

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.757
<i>Sing, dance and rap
Get hands to clap</i>

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:44.026
<i>Of course you know that</i>

01:28:44.168 --> 01:28:46.659
<i>You can't hold a candle to our flames</i>

01:28:46.804 --> 01:28:50.535
<i>Tear it up and we takin' names
It's not a game, it's a shame</i>

01:28:50.675 --> 01:28:53.007
<i>You can't be like us
Can't be like us</i>

01:28:53.144 --> 01:28:55.510
<i>We leave you in the dust
Of course we tear it up</i>

01:28:55.646 --> 01:28:57.614
<i>When we're out on the floor
We'll take over the ball</i>

01:28:57.749 --> 01:29:00.309
<i>Stealin' the show
We're gonna leave you in awe</i>

01:29:00.451 --> 01:29:02.783
<i>When we're comin' up
When we're comin' up</i>

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.514
<i>We gonna tear it down</i>

01:29:05.656 --> 01:29:09.251
<i>You can't stop us now
You can't shut us down</i>

01:29:09.394 --> 01:29:11.123
<i>You can't top the sound</i>

01:29:11.262 --> 01:29:15.392
<i>Better get ready now
We gonna tear it down</i>

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:20.728
<i>The looks, we got 'em
The moves, we got 'em</i>

01:29:20.872 --> 01:29:25.775
<i>The style, we got it
We gonna tear it down</i>

01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:30.813
<i>The love, we got it
The crowd, we own it</i>

01:29:30.948 --> 01:29:35.817
<i>Tonight, we run it
We gonna tear it down</i>

01:29:45.596 --> 01:29:47.359
Camp Star, everyone.

01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:56.404
Remember, if you loved them
as much as I did, call or text in now.

01:29:56.541 --> 01:29:57.906
But don't go anywhere,

01:29:58.042 --> 01:30:01.205
because in a moment
we're gonna hear from Camp Rock.

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:09.283
- What happened to you?
- When I get nervous I sparkle things.

01:30:10.254 --> 01:30:12.449
- Would you stop and listen?
- You sounded good too.

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:17.323
- Hey, you guys were incredible.
- I know, right?

01:30:17.462 --> 01:30:20.863
Only one thing would've made it better:
doing it solo.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.858
I totally agree.

01:30:27.405 --> 01:30:28.895
It's this bantery thing that we...

01:30:31.442 --> 01:30:32.966
Thanks.

01:30:34.045 --> 01:30:35.569
Good luck.

01:30:40.384 --> 01:30:42.682
Quite a performance, eh?

01:30:44.789 --> 01:30:45.847
No denying it.

01:30:46.624 --> 01:30:48.717
But don't count
those votes just yet, love.

01:30:48.993 --> 01:30:52.087
- I think you're gonna be very impressed.
- I don't need to be impressed.

01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:55.358
- It'd be a miracle if Axel didn't win.
- Excuse me?

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.400
You know how much money
he spent marketing this?

01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:01.198
He's paying to text and tweet every cell
phone user in the western hemisphere.

01:31:01.339 --> 01:31:04.240
You don't even need to see the show
to know to vote for Camp Star.

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:06.305
One minute.

01:31:06.444 --> 01:31:09.242
How come I just got a text
telling me to vote for Camp Star?

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.574
I just got one too.

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:14.651
It's asking me if I wanna download
Camp Star's song as my ringtone.

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:17.020
You were really a star.

01:31:17.588 --> 01:31:19.215
Thanks.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:21.916
And I really gotta go.

01:31:22.059 --> 01:31:25.517
Oh, I hate crust on my bread,
and birds make me nervous.

01:31:27.298 --> 01:31:31.428
Excuse me.
Oh, ah, that performance was amazing.

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:33.002
Thank you.

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:36.373
- Don't you have somewhere to be?
- Yes, but, you know,

01:31:36.507 --> 01:31:39.567
once you start expressing your
innermost thoughts and feelings,

01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:42.304
it's kind of hard to stop.

01:31:42.947 --> 01:31:45.074
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck.

01:31:45.683 --> 01:31:48.550
Dana, he is the enemy.

01:31:48.953 --> 01:31:52.286
No, he's not. Not everything in life
is a competition.

01:31:53.658 --> 01:31:56.786
But I think I just won.

01:32:04.402 --> 01:32:06.302
And we're back. If you liked Camp Star,

01:32:06.437 --> 01:32:09.099
get ready to be blown away
by Camp Rock.

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.265
Now, Camp Rock was founded
by rock icon

01:32:11.409 --> 01:32:14.640
and legendary lead guitarist
Brown Cesario.

01:32:17.949 --> 01:32:20.383
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:25.722
Ladies and gentlemen, Camp Rock.

01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:40.998
<i>They say that life is a two-way street</i>

01:32:41.138 --> 01:32:44.938
<i>When you're not sure
You gotta trust your feet</i>

01:32:45.076 --> 01:32:48.443
<i>To know the right way</i>

01:32:48.579 --> 01:32:51.377
<i>You can keep on moving
With your head down</i>

01:32:51.515 --> 01:32:55.110
<i>- Or you can stop and take a look around
- Take a look around</i>

01:32:55.253 --> 01:32:59.690
<i>- And that's the choice I've made
- I've made, yeah</i>

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:04.761
<i>- It's for that movie inside your head
- It's for that movie inside your head</i>

01:33:04.895 --> 01:33:09.764
<i>- Making memories we can't forget
- Making memories we can't forget</i>

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:11.765
<i>And when you can't forget</i>

01:33:11.902 --> 01:33:17.431
<i>You're gonna know
In your soul</i>

01:33:17.908 --> 01:33:22.004
<i>This is what we came here for</i>

01:33:22.146 --> 01:33:26.708
<i>- So live it loud
- Here and now</i>

01:33:27.985 --> 01:33:32.581
<i>This moment, it won't be ignored</i>

01:33:33.591 --> 01:33:39.188
<i>So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for</i>

01:33:40.998 --> 01:33:43.432
<i>- Oh, oh
- Oh, yeah</i>

01:33:43.567 --> 01:33:46.400
<i>For every song we let play outside</i>

01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:48.698
<i>The melodies we get to ride</i>

01:33:48.839 --> 01:33:52.468
<i>- We get to ride
- Every time we sing</i>

01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:54.202
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:33:54.345 --> 01:33:56.939
<i>The friends we've made
The fun we've had</i>

01:33:57.081 --> 01:34:00.517
<i>Remembering's gonna make me laugh</i>

01:34:00.651 --> 01:34:04.644
<i>- It's a beautiful thing
- So beautiful</i>

01:34:04.789 --> 01:34:08.555
<i>- I wanna send it around the world
- I wanna send it around the world</i>

01:34:08.693 --> 01:34:10.160
<i>All around the world</i>

01:34:10.294 --> 01:34:14.993
<i>- 'Cause everybody should feel this good
- 'Cause everybody should feel this good</i>

01:34:15.132 --> 01:34:16.997
<i>'Cause when you feel this good</i>

01:34:17.134 --> 01:34:19.364
<i>- You're gonna know
- You're gonna know</i>

01:34:45.896 --> 01:34:48.387
<i>You're gonna know</i>

01:34:48.532 --> 01:34:51.194
<i>In your soul</i>

01:34:51.335 --> 01:34:55.635
<i>This is what we came here for</i>

01:34:55.773 --> 01:35:00.437
<i>Oh, so live it loud
Here and now</i>

01:35:01.912 --> 01:35:07.441
<i>This moment, it won't be ignored</i>

01:35:07.585 --> 01:35:11.544
<i>You're gonna know
In your soul</i>

01:35:12.823 --> 01:35:16.987
<i>This is what we came here for</i>

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:19.619
<i>- So live it loud
- Live it loud</i>

01:35:19.764 --> 01:35:21.959
<i>Here and now</i>

01:35:22.867 --> 01:35:26.325
<i>This moment, it won't be ignored</i>

01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:27.732
<i>It won't be ignored</i>

01:35:27.872 --> 01:35:32.571
<i>- So why not open up that door?
- Open up that door</i>

01:35:33.177 --> 01:35:39.673
<i>So come on, open up that door</i>

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:41.307
<i>It's what we came here</i>

01:35:41.452 --> 01:35:42.578
<i>Surprise!</i>

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.781
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Came here</i>

01:35:46.924 --> 01:35:49.358
<i>For</i>

01:35:49.493 --> 01:35:54.260
<i>It's what we came here
Came here for</i>

01:36:00.638 --> 01:36:01.832
Whoo!

01:36:05.509 --> 01:36:07.739
Weren't they incredible?

01:36:07.878 --> 01:36:11.473
So call in now, and tell us
which summer camp rules.

01:36:11.615 --> 01:36:14.607
And don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back.

01:36:19.089 --> 01:36:21.319
Call in, call in.

01:36:21.759 --> 01:36:23.989
- Yes!
- Wow!

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:40.905
Impressive, but it'll never sell.

01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:46.380
You know,
it should still be about the music.

01:36:46.984 --> 01:36:51.887
Maybe so, but that's why
you'll never make it in this business.

01:36:52.756 --> 01:36:55.816
That's fine.
I don't wanna be in your business.

01:37:00.331 --> 01:37:02.925
And the results are in.

01:38:34.758 --> 01:38:38.216
You know, I was thinking about
keeping this as a souvenir. Heh.

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.394
Can't believe we lost.

01:38:46.737 --> 01:38:48.204
Every song can't be a hit.

01:38:50.874 --> 01:38:52.501
Isn't that what you told me?

01:38:54.778 --> 01:38:57.338
Doesn't mean we have to stop singing.

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.655
I'm really sorry I didn't spend
more time with you this summer.

01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:10.182
- Hey, the whole reason I came here...
- Was to get to know me better.

01:39:10.761 --> 01:39:12.888
And I've learned everything
I need to know.

01:39:43.627 --> 01:39:47.859
<i>So let's sing
Na, na-na-na, na</i>

01:39:47.998 --> 01:39:50.762
<i>Hey, ya</i>

01:39:51.435 --> 01:39:55.565
<i>Come on and sing
Na, na-na-na, na</i>

01:39:55.706 --> 01:39:58.573
<i>Hey, ya</i>

01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:04.373
<i>This is our song
That's all that matters</i>

01:40:04.515 --> 01:40:08.576
<i>'Cause we all belong
Right here together</i>

01:40:08.719 --> 01:40:12.678
<i>There's nothin' better
Than singin' along</i>

01:40:12.823 --> 01:40:15.053
<i>This is our summer</i>

01:40:15.659 --> 01:40:18.719
<i>This is our song</i>

01:40:20.998 --> 01:40:24.490
<i>Come grab your guitar</i>

01:40:24.835 --> 01:40:27.463
<i>Sit by the fire</i>

01:40:28.038 --> 01:40:31.496
<i>'Cause we all need a song</i>

01:40:31.909 --> 01:40:35.208
<i>When we're weary and tired</i>

01:40:35.546 --> 01:40:39.380
<i>We'll sit here together</i>

01:40:39.516 --> 01:40:42.576
<i>- And sing it out loud
- And sing it out loud</i>

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.553
<i>This is our song
That's all that matters</i>

01:40:45.689 --> 01:40:49.625
<i>'Cause we all belong
Right here together</i>

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.321
<i>There's nothin' better
Than singin' along</i>

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:59.630
<i>This is our summer
And this is our song</i>

01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:03.767
<i>This is our song</i>

01:41:03.907 --> 01:41:07.570
<i>This is our song</i>

01:41:07.711 --> 01:41:09.975
<i>This is our song</i>

01:41:12.249 --> 01:41:13.773
What's that?

01:41:26.797 --> 01:41:30.665
- Hi, we saw the fire.
- We really don't get to do this kind of thing.

01:41:30.801 --> 01:41:33.497
So we were hoping there was room
for some of us to join.

01:41:35.038 --> 01:41:36.164
There's always room.

01:41:36.306 --> 01:41:39.537
If it's okay with you, I'd really like to
come back to Camp Rock next summer.

01:41:39.676 --> 01:41:40.870
Come on.

01:41:41.011 --> 01:41:43.980
<i>Come on and sing
Na, na, na, na, na</i>

01:41:44.114 --> 01:41:46.742
<i>Hey, ya</i>

01:41:46.884 --> 01:41:49.284
Hey, can I get a little help inside?

01:41:49.419 --> 01:41:52.047
- The phones are going crazy.
- Yeah, sure, I'll help.

01:41:52.489 --> 01:41:55.049
I told my parents I wanna come here
instead next summer.

01:41:55.192 --> 01:41:58.753
<i>Come on and sing
Na, na-na-na, na</i>

01:41:58.896 --> 01:42:01.364
<i>Hey, ya</i>

01:42:02.666 --> 01:42:06.568
Please, can you put us on the list?
This place is so much more fun.

01:42:06.703 --> 01:42:08.500
I'm sure we can work something out.

01:42:10.007 --> 01:42:13.568
<i>Come on and sing
Na, na-na-na, na</i>

01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:18.409
<i>- Hey, ya
- Hey, ya</i>

01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:21.450
<i>This is our song
That's all that matters</i>

01:42:21.585 --> 01:42:25.248
<i>'Cause we all belong
Right here together</i>

01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:29.655
<i>There's nothin' better
Than singin' along</i>

01:42:29.793 --> 01:42:32.455
<i>- This is our summer
- Our summer</i>

01:42:33.197 --> 01:42:36.325
<i>This is our song
That's all that matters</i>

01:42:36.466 --> 01:42:40.596
<i>'Cause we all belong
Right here together</i>

01:42:40.737 --> 01:42:44.400
<i>There's nothin' better
Than singin' along</i>

01:42:44.541 --> 01:42:48.910
<i>This is our summer
And this is our song</i>

01:42:49.046 --> 01:42:52.675

<i>- This is our song

We're all a go.

- I'm not laughing. Dead serious, y'all.
- Marker take 14.

01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:36.286
She's the boss, she's serious.
We're all serious.
