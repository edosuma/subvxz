00:01.002 --> 00:02.587
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.671 --> 00:04.005
On March 30th, I was told

00:04.089 --> 00:06.508
to withdraw money
from these places.

00:06.591 --> 00:08.635
Were you delivering
the money on your own behalf?

00:08.718 --> 00:10.929
Ms. Martin, we need
to know who this is,

00:11.012 --> 00:12.222
or we can all go home.

00:12.305 --> 00:14.224
A senior White House official.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.267
You mean David Wellington?

00:16.351 --> 00:18.144
- This woman is lying.
- What are you talking about?

00:18.228 --> 00:19.771
She's full of shit, and now
she's lying to a senator.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.356
We have to pull the plug.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.108
Whoever's bankrolling
this woman also wants

00:23.191 --> 00:24.818
McClendon's murder
pinned on the White House.

00:24.901 --> 00:26.111
So she was supposed
to get caught?

00:26.194 --> 00:27.737
Is that what you're saying?

00:27.821 --> 00:29.614
She was supposed to testify
in front of the Committee?

00:29.698 --> 00:33.451
Weren't you and your FBI friend
interested in just this outcome?

00:33.535 --> 00:35.578
You said you had
some questions about Dante?

00:35.662 --> 00:37.664
I'd like to hear what you know
about his work life.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.833
You know what really
bugged him?

00:39.916 --> 00:43.336
Right around the time he's sent
home from Kabul, total pariah,

00:43.420 --> 00:46.464
there's this woman,
this CIA station chief

00:46.548 --> 00:48.091
who's completely off the rails.

00:48.174 --> 00:51.302
And you know what she gets?
A promotion.

00:58.977 --> 01:00.437
He's FBI.
He spent several years

01:00.520 --> 01:01.771
in counterterrorism overseas.

01:01.855 --> 01:03.106
- Hey, sir.
- Yeah?

01:03.189 --> 01:04.399
We may have a problem.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.443
She was warned
to stay clear.

01:08.278 --> 01:11.030
...why you went to Audrey.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.657
Because I think you're--
Aah!

01:12.741 --> 01:15.827
- Get on the ground!
- On the ground!

01:15.910 --> 01:17.579
- No!
- Don't move!

01:17.662 --> 01:20.206
- Get the fuck off me!
- It's okay.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.000
It's okay, Franny.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.003
Shh.

01:35.305 --> 01:37.807
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:37.891 --> 01:39.309
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:39.392 --> 01:43.646
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:43.730 --> 01:47.317
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:47.400 --> 01:49.903
<i>But you don't have
my condition.</i>

01:49.986 --> 01:52.447
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

01:52.530 --> 01:53.823
<i>since I was 22.</i>

01:55.700 --> 01:59.245
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

01:59.329 --> 02:01.873
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:03.166 --> 02:05.877
<i>Civil... War!</i>

02:05.960 --> 02:08.046
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:08.129 --> 02:10.924
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:11.007 --> 02:13.218
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:13.301 --> 02:15.970
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:16.054 --> 02:19.557
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:22.435 --> 02:25.814
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:25.897 --> 02:29.567
<i>I'm talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:29.651 --> 02:32.654
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:34.155 --> 02:37.534
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:39.160 --> 02:42.413
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

02:44.791 --> 02:47.627
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:47.710 --> 02:52.423
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:02.809 --> 03:05.478
You okay?

03:05.562 --> 03:08.648
Hey, I know you're upset
about last night. It was scary.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.233
I was scared.

03:10.316 --> 03:13.152
But everything's okay now.
We're fine.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.613
Um, but this is the thing,
sweetheart --

03:15.697 --> 03:18.366
you can't talk about it,
not to anyone.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.784
Why?

03:19.868 --> 03:22.287
'Cause I could get in
really, really big trouble.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.830
Do you hear
what I'm saying?

03:23.913 --> 03:26.457
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:30.587 --> 03:32.380
Oh! It's Mrs. Clarke.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.591
- She's your favorite, right?
- Franny!

03:34.674 --> 03:36.634
What's up? Oh.

03:36.718 --> 03:38.928
Uh, she had a rough night
last night. Not much sleep.

03:39.012 --> 03:41.431
Oh. You poor thing.

03:41.514 --> 03:44.934
Okay, I'm gonna go now.
Okay, sweetheart?

03:45.018 --> 03:47.270
I love you.

03:47.353 --> 03:48.855
It's okay.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.566
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

04:03.328 --> 04:04.746
Yeah?

04:04.829 --> 04:06.748
You fucked me up.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.875
I was working him.
I had a plan.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.336
Oh. That's what you call it?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.129
No, I'm telling you,
I was close.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.464
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

04:14.547 --> 04:16.257
I've got this.

04:16.341 --> 04:18.009
<i>Yeah, only you don't,</i>

04:18.092 --> 04:19.802
because if you understood how
he thinks, you would never

04:19.886 --> 04:22.263
have sent an assault team
to break down his front door.

04:22.347 --> 04:24.933
<i>He's got a list of
grievances a mile long that,</i>

04:25.016 --> 04:26.976
<i>in his mind,
justifies anything he does.</i>

04:27.060 --> 04:28.978
I mean, you just
added to that.

04:29.062 --> 04:30.813
I need
to talk to you.

04:30.897 --> 04:33.316
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.777
<i>No, not like this.
Where are you?</i>

04:37.487 --> 04:40.031
Damn it, Saul!
Simone testifies in two days.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.075
<i>If you were
really so sure you had a way</i>

04:42.158 --> 04:44.577
<i>to stop that, you wouldn't have
answered the phone.</i>

04:45.954 --> 04:48.081
<i>Where are you?</i>

04:55.755 --> 04:59.133
So... General McClendon's death

04:59.217 --> 05:01.844
is now officially
a murder investigation.

05:01.928 --> 05:05.139
Yes. I was already aware.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.393
The Director briefed me.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.353
And you accept
his conclusions?

05:10.436 --> 05:12.397
Where are you going
with this?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.857
We're here, Madam President,

05:14.941 --> 05:18.027
committee members from
both sides of the aisle,

05:18.111 --> 05:22.031
because for us,
the path forward is clear.

05:22.115 --> 05:24.492
And what is that?

05:24.575 --> 05:27.286
General McClendon was murdered.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.164
We have a witness appearing
before us in two days

05:30.248 --> 05:32.250
who will implicate
your Chief of Staff

05:32.333 --> 05:34.961
and therefore, you,
in the general's death.

05:35.044 --> 05:38.256
We're here...

05:38.339 --> 05:40.842
to ask you to resign.

05:49.475 --> 05:52.895
You've been wanting to say that
since the day I was sworn in,

05:52.979 --> 05:54.731
so...there.

05:54.814 --> 05:56.482
You finally did.

05:59.652 --> 06:03.114
- If you do this...
- Resign.

06:03.197 --> 06:06.826
...we'll cancel Ms. Martin's
appearance before the committee

06:06.909 --> 06:11.831
and spare you, and the country,
the chaos that would result

06:11.914 --> 06:13.791
from these kinds of
criminal charges

06:13.875 --> 06:16.502
being leveled against
this office.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.258
Let me ask you something.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.803
We have known each other
15 years.

06:25.887 --> 06:29.348
Shari, we have known each other
even longer than that.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.059
All of us,

06:31.142 --> 06:34.812
we have worked
on committees together,

06:34.896 --> 06:36.773
voted together,

06:36.856 --> 06:39.317
attended
how many functions?

06:39.400 --> 06:42.028
Together.

06:42.111 --> 06:45.531
Do any of you really think
that I, what,

06:45.615 --> 06:49.327
plucked an assassin
from some dark corner

06:49.410 --> 06:52.455
and sent him
to the general's cell?

06:55.541 --> 06:57.543
I am asking.

06:57.627 --> 06:59.879
Seriously.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.798
That's what the witness
is saying.

07:01.881 --> 07:04.884
- And you believe her?
- The country will.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.095
That is not what
I am asking.

07:07.178 --> 07:12.183
Do you honestly think
that <i>I</i> am capable of this?

07:14.852 --> 07:17.146
All of us,

07:17.230 --> 07:19.315
I'm sure you, too,

07:19.398 --> 07:21.984
have had to accept
that things we thought

07:22.068 --> 07:25.863
could never happen
in this country apparently can.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.701
That's why we came to you
privately.

07:30.785 --> 07:34.038
No staffers, no leaking
to the press.

07:34.122 --> 07:38.584
No one wants these accusations
to ever see the light of day.

07:38.668 --> 07:41.379
We're asking you
to do the right thing,

07:41.462 --> 07:43.798
Madam President.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.147
This way.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.408
Okay, all right. Um...

08:25.882 --> 08:27.592
He's back here.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.022
What have you got on him?

08:41.105 --> 08:42.857
Travel.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.443
His lines up with Simone
Martin's quite convincingly.

08:45.526 --> 08:49.113
Yes, I know you told Max
to check that out.

08:49.197 --> 08:51.449
Good.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.701
You helped.
I'm not saying you didn't.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.459
- I wanna do it.
- Do what?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.794
What do you think?
Be the one to talk to him.

09:03.878 --> 09:05.671
No. I get one shot.

09:05.755 --> 09:07.757
Which is why I should do it.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.717
I've known him for years,
since Kabul.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.469
I know how he thinks.
We spent the past month

09:11.552 --> 09:14.722
- as partners, practically.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.766
I don't get it.
I-I really don't.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.310
Why are you shutting me out?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.438
You brought Dante in
based on intel I developed.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.399
I understand him, certainly
better than anyone here.

09:25.483 --> 09:28.277
I can break him. You know I can.
I've done it before.

09:28.361 --> 09:31.405
I don't trust you.

09:31.489 --> 09:33.783
Not like I used to.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.578
Running around like
some deranged vigilante.

09:37.662 --> 09:39.538
What, y-you think
I don't know

09:39.622 --> 09:41.374
how insane
my life has become?

09:41.457 --> 09:44.335
I-I-I feel it every second
of every day,

09:44.418 --> 09:46.963
and it is killing me.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.222
But you're wrong about
not being able to trust me.

09:56.305 --> 09:59.642
That man sought me out
and used me.

09:59.725 --> 10:03.354
I am motivated more than anyone
to get him to admit that.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.277
Please.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.988
Let me try.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.160
- Resign.
- Yeah.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.621
He used that word.

10:20.705 --> 10:23.124
He said it was
the right thing to do.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.377
It would save the country
from chaos.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.380
Yeah, and us from
prosecution, I bet.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.008
Oh, yeah. That was part
of the pitch.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.635
I don't know why I'm so shocked.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.554
It was obvious
where this was heading.

10:36.637 --> 10:40.182
I said it before.
I'll resign.

10:40.266 --> 10:43.477
And I said before, I don't
want your resignation.

10:43.561 --> 10:46.063
He's counting on that,
wearing us down

10:46.147 --> 10:49.859
so at some point, we'll do
anything just to make it stop.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.945
What I want is proof

10:53.029 --> 10:55.406
that will shut down
this witness.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.199
That's what Saul's
trying to get us.

10:57.283 --> 10:59.869
And have you heard from him?
No, neither have I.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.791
I've got people

11:05.875 --> 11:08.627
who could look into
where Simone is being held.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.921
- I could go talk to her.
- No.

11:11.005 --> 11:12.548
Paley finds out
you even tried,

11:12.631 --> 11:14.550
it makes everything
a hundred times worse.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.053
Let me talk to
the Russians then.

11:17.136 --> 11:20.723
You've spoken to Saul. You know
they're behind all this.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.225
While he's working his angle,

11:23.309 --> 11:25.603
I'll put pressure
directly on Moscow,

11:25.686 --> 11:29.440
get them worried
how this might end.

11:31.359 --> 11:34.862
I can't read between the lines
on this, Elizabeth.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.032
You're gonna have to tell me
yes or no.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.077
They've had a free run
at us.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.373
Tell them in terms
they understand. No more.

12:18.864 --> 12:22.326
<i>At least now it makes sense.</i>

12:22.410 --> 12:23.911
<i>I open my house to you,</i>

12:23.994 --> 12:25.371
<i>next thing I know,</i>

12:25.454 --> 12:27.123
<i>the SWAT team's
breaking down my door.</i>

12:27.206 --> 12:28.541
- That wasn't me.
- Sure.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.000
You think I'd put
my daughter through that?

12:30.084 --> 12:31.585
Absolutely.

12:31.669 --> 12:35.464
I don't think you
give a damn about anyone.

12:35.548 --> 12:38.050
Do they know?
Do they know?

12:38.134 --> 12:39.844
What?

12:39.927 --> 12:42.346
What a lunatic
I'm sitting across from.

12:42.430 --> 12:44.140
That your meds have
stopped working,

12:44.223 --> 12:45.891
that you're self-medicating
with God knows what drugs

12:45.975 --> 12:47.852
<i>you buy from some skeeze
in a parking lot,</i>

12:47.935 --> 12:49.270
<i>that your entire
mental health plan</i>

12:49.353 --> 12:50.688
<i>is having me tell you</i>

12:50.771 --> 12:52.898
when to medicate
because you have no idea?

12:54.567 --> 12:57.027
Well, let me tell you,
whatever you're on right now,

12:57.111 --> 12:59.447
the dosage is way off.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.200
You know, my life may have
been less than perfect

13:03.284 --> 13:04.827
before you showed up,

13:04.910 --> 13:06.912
but you've turned it into
a regular shit fest.

13:06.996 --> 13:09.540
And I don't know what you think
you've found out about me,

13:09.623 --> 13:11.709
but it's a fantasy,

13:11.792 --> 13:14.962
like every other thought in that
fucked up brain of yours.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.674
Are you done?

13:18.757 --> 13:22.303
No, I'm not done.
Why am I here?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.730
This is Simone Martin,

13:32.813 --> 13:34.607
- a French national.
- Yeah, I know who she is.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.442
We ran an operation on her
together, remember?

13:36.525 --> 13:37.860
This shows that her NGO,

13:37.943 --> 13:39.820
the International Democracy
Foundation,

13:39.904 --> 13:41.906
is a front set up
by the Russian government,

13:41.989 --> 13:44.033
not to promote democracy,
as the name suggests,

13:44.116 --> 13:45.701
but to undermine
opposition groups.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.914
It's funded by money she
launders for these oligarchs

13:49.997 --> 13:53.250
with these connections
to the Kremlin.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.085
These you've seen before--

13:55.169 --> 13:57.630
evidence that she personally
delivered the funds

13:57.713 --> 13:59.131
for the hit
on General McClendon,

13:59.215 --> 14:01.550
which makes that murder
a Russian operation

14:01.634 --> 14:05.930
designed to bring down our
president, Elizabeth Keane.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.310
- So aren't you gonna ask?
- What?

14:11.393 --> 14:12.811
- "What's that got to do
with me?"
- I don't need to.

14:12.895 --> 14:13.896
It's got nothing to do with me.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.898
Yeah, except that it does,

14:15.981 --> 14:17.441
because while Simone Martin

14:17.525 --> 14:18.817
is traveling through
Eastern Europe,

14:18.901 --> 14:21.862
supposedly
promoting democracy...

14:21.946 --> 14:24.865
there <i>you</i> are,
right with her.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.660
Same cities, same hotels.

14:27.743 --> 14:30.579
Separate rooms,
as far as I know.

14:35.543 --> 14:38.045
You've been working with
an agent of the Russian state.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.838
You conspired with her
to implicate

14:39.922 --> 14:42.216
the White House Chief of Staff
in McClendon's murder.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.676
That is why you're here--

14:43.759 --> 14:46.720
treason against
the United States.

14:46.804 --> 14:50.558
We have enough
to put you away for life.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.203
Fuck it.

15:11.287 --> 15:13.247
I have to take a leak.

15:14.999 --> 15:19.670
Or I can go in the corner.
It's been six hours.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.088
Dante...

15:23.382 --> 15:25.217
Just fucking don't.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.267
Take him through the front.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.303
Is it true what he said
about your meds not working?

16:09.386 --> 16:12.139
Yeah, only not like
he said it.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.099
Anything else
you wanna tell me?

16:14.183 --> 16:16.685
Yeah, he's the enemy,
not me.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.869
Mr. Ambassador.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.496
Thank you for coming.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.081
It's my pleasure.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.416
Shall we go in? I understand
there is some urgency--

16:39.500 --> 16:41.835
Actually,
the president's engaged.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.380
Why don't you and I talk?

16:56.475 --> 17:00.562
Um, between us, uh...

17:00.646 --> 17:03.899
everyone at the Embassy
sends condolences.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.150
How so?

17:05.234 --> 17:07.027
That woman on the video
yelling at you,

17:07.111 --> 17:08.987
screaming up a storm.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.449
All of them are crazier
than usual these days.

17:14.702 --> 17:16.662
I appreciate that.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.414
And, in fact,
she's the exact person

17:18.497 --> 17:20.249
I wanted to talk
to you about.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.000
That woman, Simone Martin,

17:22.084 --> 17:25.504
is about to perjure herself
in front of a Senate committee.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.257
The president would like you
to inform Moscow

17:28.340 --> 17:31.593
that if that happens,
if Ms. Martin lies,

17:31.677 --> 17:36.432
we will treat it as
a hostile act.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.600
Why?

17:38.684 --> 17:40.769
Because she's
a Russian operative.

17:40.853 --> 17:44.898
You can't be serious.

17:47.526 --> 17:51.947
I understand, Viktor,
that you have to say that.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.574
Nonetheless,

17:53.657 --> 17:56.785
please tell Moscow that
if Simone Martin lies--

17:56.869 --> 17:58.871
- But we don't control that.
- ...if she lies,

17:58.954 --> 18:01.623
there will be consequences
for your country.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.084
- What consequences?
- As I said,

18:04.168 --> 18:08.046
President Keane will
treat it as a hostile act.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.507
We are not responsible
for that woman.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.259
If you cannot handle her,

18:12.342 --> 18:13.635
I don't know what
you expect me to do.

18:13.719 --> 18:16.472
Well, the Sixth Directorate
will know.

18:19.516 --> 18:23.061
Pass the message to Moscow.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.278
<i>What is this place?</i>

18:33.113 --> 18:35.824
<i>Come on. You practically
gave me a tour of it.</i>

18:37.659 --> 18:39.495
<i>It's a secure site.
You've seen them before.</i>

18:39.578 --> 18:41.121
<i>Yeah, well, this one
I'm concerned</i>

18:41.205 --> 18:42.164
<i>about the quality
of their work.</i>

18:42.247 --> 18:44.041
And why is that?

18:44.124 --> 18:47.044
This. It's meaningless.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.922
<i>You know I work Russian
organized crime for the Bureau.</i>

18:50.005 --> 18:51.715
<i>That's why I travel abroad,</i>

18:51.799 --> 18:53.967
<i>to meet police contacts,
confidential informants.</i>

18:54.051 --> 18:57.012
<i>You can check it all out.
In fact, I don't even...</i>

18:57.095 --> 18:58.597
<i>In fact, y-you don't
really control your schedule.</i>

18:58.680 --> 19:00.098
<i>You don't even book
your own hotels.</i>

19:00.182 --> 19:01.934
<i>The local FBI office does.
So the fact you were</i>

19:02.017 --> 19:03.352
in the same building
with Simone Martin

19:03.435 --> 19:06.355
at the same time couldn't
possibly be your doing.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.690
You know what? I...
I'm not interested.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.109
- You should be. It's true.
- But it's not the truth.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.986
You lost me there.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.241
Six weeks ago, I was
sitting in a coffee shop

19:17.324 --> 19:18.909
across from the Capitol.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.453
Paley just held five hours
of hearings on the 200,

19:21.537 --> 19:23.288
who I considered
political prisoners.

19:23.372 --> 19:25.040
I went every day.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.335
And I was sitting there, fuming
at the injustice of it all.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.212
And I heard a voice--

19:30.295 --> 19:33.632
soft, but not too soft--
on a phone nearby,

19:33.715 --> 19:36.260
saying the exact things that
were going through my head.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.887
And I turned to look,

19:38.971 --> 19:41.056
and it was you.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.183
You sought me out.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.394
You used our friendship
to send me back

19:45.477 --> 19:48.063
against my own country,
which, makes me,

19:48.146 --> 19:51.358
as the Russians call it,
an active measure.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.943
But it makes you a traitor.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.363
- You really think that?
- No, I know that.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.329
But I also know how
it started...

20:04.413 --> 20:05.956
when the Bureau shipped you
back from Kabul

20:06.039 --> 20:08.333
for something that was
not your fault.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.835
How they mistreated you

20:09.918 --> 20:12.546
after everything
you had done for them.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.717
And I understand.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.220
- Nothing <i>to</i> understand.
- I understand.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.099
The problem isn't that
you don't love your country.

20:24.182 --> 20:27.102
It's that your country
doesn't love you back.

20:30.814 --> 20:34.776
<i>I know what that's like.</i>

20:34.860 --> 20:37.988
<i>- Oh, please.
- What?</i>

20:38.071 --> 20:39.698
<i>What? You think I wasn't
beaten down</i>

20:39.781 --> 20:41.408
by the CIA as much
as you were by the Bureau?

20:41.491 --> 20:44.703
You think I had some-some
privileged treatment there?

20:44.786 --> 20:46.997
A promotion? A medal?

20:47.080 --> 20:50.334
No. No, I got nothing.
I left. I had to.

20:50.417 --> 20:54.087
There was no place for me.
And I know, just like you,

20:54.171 --> 20:56.757
how unbearable it is
to be on the outside

20:56.840 --> 20:59.092
after you've been in.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.516
Where we've both landed
is unfair.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.478
- I haven't landed anywhere.
- We've both been used.

21:12.397 --> 21:16.318
I know how it happens,
how-how things derail.

21:16.401 --> 21:19.112
You think...

21:19.196 --> 21:21.448
No, I can manage this,
but...

21:22.908 --> 21:25.035
Step by step, somehow,

21:25.118 --> 21:29.373
you end up very far from where
you ever wanted to be.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.805
Nothing has happened yet
that can't be fixed.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.849
This can all be undone.

21:47.933 --> 21:52.354
Yes, I am telling you,
we can make that happen.

21:52.437 --> 21:56.149
But we are running out of time.
You have to be honest now.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.403
- Honest.
- Yeah.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.405
Right now. With me.

22:09.705 --> 22:11.123
Okay.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.047
What I remember about
that coffee shop

22:19.131 --> 22:21.717
isn't being on the phone.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.760
And if I was, I have no idea

22:23.844 --> 22:26.805
what I was talking about
or to whom.

22:26.888 --> 22:30.058
All I remember is
I was divorced,

22:30.142 --> 22:34.396
my career was a mess...

22:34.479 --> 22:37.274
Then I saw you,

22:37.357 --> 22:38.942
walking up to me
with that smile of yours

22:39.026 --> 22:41.236
<i>'cause you were happy
to see me,</i>

22:41.319 --> 22:44.364
<i>which no one else had been
for a very long time.</i>

22:44.448 --> 22:45.782
Fuck.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.492
<i>I would've
followed you anywhere.</i>

22:47.576 --> 22:49.286
In fact, I did.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.496
You talked me into being
a whistle-blower,

22:51.580 --> 22:53.707
- which I did not wanna do.
- That is not true.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.083
You stuffed me into
the trunk of a car

22:55.167 --> 22:56.501
and took me to see Paley

22:56.585 --> 22:58.628
after you promised you wouldn't.
That's certainly true.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.422
And you told me about Simone.

23:00.505 --> 23:03.133
I never even heard
of her before you.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.927
So if I'm being
totally honest...

23:08.138 --> 23:10.348
I want my lawyer.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.350
You hear that?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.561
<i>I want my fucking lawyer!</i>

23:21.026 --> 23:23.111
I'm done.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.337
He's lying.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.798
- We'll talk about it later.
- I need another chance.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.341
He just asked for a lawyer.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.427
He won't say anything now.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.930
What you need to do
is go home.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.681
Maggie's been trying
to reach you.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.738
Please, don't do anything
with him until I get back.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.698
You want to stop Simone
from testifying?

24:08.782 --> 24:10.742
He is our only way.

25:10.302 --> 25:13.138
- Is Ms. Martin still awake?
- Yes, sir.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.561
Who is it?

25:19.644 --> 25:21.313
Sam Paley.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.781
You good?

25:31.865 --> 25:34.451
Yeah.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.871
Being, uh,
looked after okay?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.456
Fine.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.791
- Is there something wrong?
- No.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.461
Just checking in. Oh.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.214
Day after tomorrow, you're
in front of my committee.

25:47.297 --> 25:50.592
So, uh, what I'd like to do

25:50.675 --> 25:55.180
is review your, uh,
testimony,

25:55.263 --> 25:56.640
which is, uh...

25:56.723 --> 25:59.100
Well, I'll just say it.

25:59.184 --> 26:00.769
It's horseshit.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.813
- Excuse me?
- David Wellington

26:03.897 --> 26:06.608
hands you $50,000--

26:06.691 --> 26:08.443
He didn't hand it to me.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.904
I got it from five different
cash places.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.323
- To pay a hit man.
- No.

26:13.406 --> 26:17.160
He said it was for a friend
of his with a gambling debt.

26:18.912 --> 26:22.707
You supposedly gather up
50 grand in cash.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.334
You hide it in the woods...

26:24.417 --> 26:26.419
what, two hours
from where you live.

26:26.503 --> 26:29.506
You want me to believe
you did all this

26:29.589 --> 26:32.050
because David Wellington
asked you to?

26:32.133 --> 26:33.551
I trusted him.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.720
Enough to carry money
for a hit on a general?

26:35.804 --> 26:39.933
No, he told me it was for
a friend in trouble.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.651
Good.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.948
Huh.

26:55.031 --> 26:57.367
My apologies if I upset you,

26:57.450 --> 26:59.911
but, uh...

26:59.995 --> 27:02.831
I had to be sure
you're for real.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.974
Hi.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.852
- Hi, Bill.
- I've been calling.

27:23.935 --> 27:26.354
I'm sorry.
It's been a bad day.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.483
Thanks for picking up Franny,
really.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.402
Okay.

27:32.485 --> 27:35.030
I'm just gonna go up
and-and say good night.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.073
Don't. She just fell asleep.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.950
Finally.

27:41.411 --> 27:43.496
- I'll leave you to it.
- Mm-hmm.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.046
What happened?

27:55.633 --> 27:58.345
Franny wouldn't stop crying
at school today.

27:58.428 --> 28:02.390
They tried to reach you.
They couldn't. They called me.

28:02.474 --> 28:05.143
I left work to pick her up.

28:05.226 --> 28:07.562
I asked her what was wrong.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.607
She wouldn't say.
I guess you told her not to.

28:12.442 --> 28:15.111
When I got her home,
I finally got her to talk,

28:15.195 --> 28:17.906
after I promised that
you wouldn't get in trouble.

28:17.989 --> 28:21.076
Jesus.

28:21.159 --> 28:25.288
So she told me about last night
at your friend's place.

28:25.372 --> 28:29.501
Men breaking down the door,
pulling her out of bed,

28:29.584 --> 28:32.796
you screaming as your friend
was dragged from the house?

28:34.214 --> 28:38.259
And then in the morning,
you took her to school.

28:38.343 --> 28:40.970
You took her to school
and you left her there.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.933
I'm... your sister.

28:45.016 --> 28:47.227
And I love you.

28:47.310 --> 28:50.063
But I'm also a doctor, and if
I see a child being abused--

28:50.146 --> 28:52.774
- That is not fair.
- What else is it?

28:52.857 --> 28:54.734
Have you even looked at her?
She's a nervous wreck.

28:54.818 --> 28:58.238
If I see that, I have
a legal responsibility to act.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.156
So this is
what's gonna happen--

29:00.240 --> 29:01.908
I packed a suitcase for you,

29:01.991 --> 29:04.661
and either you check yourself
into the hospital tonight

29:04.744 --> 29:06.830
or I start proceedings to take
legal custody of Franny.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.582
- You can't do that.
- I can, and I will.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.376
You are not stealing
my child.

29:11.459 --> 29:12.836
You are not going
to pull this shit again!

29:12.919 --> 29:14.087
Get off of me!

29:14.170 --> 29:16.256
You have got nowhere
to take her.

29:30.728 --> 29:32.272
I'm sorry.

29:32.355 --> 29:35.150
Franny has a home here.

29:35.233 --> 29:39.154
She's... loved.
She feels safe.

29:39.237 --> 29:42.282
Please. Please, don't do this.

29:42.365 --> 29:43.867
Then come with me.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.161
Come with me right now.
I will drive you.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.038
Franny will come see you
every day.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.541
You'll get well,
you'll keep your child.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.837
Fuck.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.428
Carrie...

30:03.511 --> 30:06.556
How is it possible
you're even hesitating?

30:08.558 --> 30:11.227
Okay.

30:11.311 --> 30:14.189
There is something going on.

30:14.272 --> 30:15.857
There's always
something going on.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.401
No, I mean the country is
under attack right now.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.320
Lies, amplifiers,
fucking Twitter.

30:20.403 --> 30:21.821
People are being killed.

30:21.905 --> 30:24.032
- You're not making sense.
- No, I <i>am</i> making sense.

30:24.115 --> 30:26.701
I-I'm working with Saul.
He needs me.

30:26.784 --> 30:27.952
Franny needs you more.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.123
I can't.
I can't. I can't.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.000
Carrie!
Don't walk out that door.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.085
I said not now.

31:05.323 --> 31:07.200
Fuck.

31:50.910 --> 31:54.122
Charlotte. How are you?

31:54.205 --> 31:57.667
Ambassador,
lovely to see you.

31:59.877 --> 32:03.214
Where is he?

32:03.298 --> 32:05.717
- He's downstairs.
- Yeah?

33:59.163 --> 34:00.623
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:00.707 --> 34:02.834
- Something with Franny?
- Everything's fine.

34:02.917 --> 34:06.879
Let's talk about him.
Dante.

34:06.963 --> 34:10.091
What happened? Carrie.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.886
What happened is I left Franny
at Maggie's for the time being.

34:13.970 --> 34:15.430
What's that mean?

34:15.513 --> 34:17.598
She's gonna be
with Maggie, not me,

34:17.682 --> 34:20.143
for... a while.

34:21.436 --> 34:23.646
Listen to me.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.523
- Go back to your sister's house.
- I can't.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.024
You can.

34:27.108 --> 34:31.070
Go back there and whatever
you did, undo it.

34:31.154 --> 34:33.030
Look, you said it yourself,

34:33.114 --> 34:34.699
I've been running around
like a madman.

34:34.782 --> 34:38.327
I can't keep inflicting
that on Franny. I can't.

34:42.248 --> 34:46.753
But I also can't stop
any more than you can.

34:48.379 --> 34:53.468
That man is lying 100%.
He has to admit that

34:53.551 --> 34:55.636
so the president who was
elected to run this country

34:55.720 --> 34:58.222
can continue to do her job.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.974
Am I wrong?

35:00.057 --> 35:04.437
You're not wrong.
But we're out of time.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.981
Maybe not.

35:07.064 --> 35:09.025
I have an idea about
what to do next.

35:09.108 --> 35:12.153
Carrie, he asked
for a lawyer.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.071
I know.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.532
Let's give him one.

35:56.697 --> 35:59.742
You represent Simone Martin?

36:01.619 --> 36:03.579
- Who are you?
- The guy paying the bills.

36:03.663 --> 36:06.749
I need to know where she is.

36:06.833 --> 36:09.001
She's sequestered.
I don't know where she is.

36:09.085 --> 36:11.796
- But you can find out.
- No.

36:11.879 --> 36:15.091
I'm sure you can.

36:17.134 --> 36:20.304
Like I found out that your mom
is in St. Jude's Nursing Home,

36:20.388 --> 36:25.226
being treated for Alzheimer's,
paid for entirely by Medicaid,

36:25.309 --> 36:26.727
even though she has assets

36:26.811 --> 36:29.730
of millions and millions
of dollars--

36:29.814 --> 36:34.443
assets you have hidden through
two pass-through corporations.

36:34.527 --> 36:38.155
Find out where Simone Martin
is being held.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.033
I'll call you in an hour.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.594
<i>Patrick Steyer,
Toibin and Associates.</i>

36:59.677 --> 37:02.430
<i>You have a client of mine--
Dante Allen.</i>

37:15.443 --> 37:17.570
Let him in.

37:20.865 --> 37:22.491
He's here, your attorney.

37:22.575 --> 37:23.910
Took you long enough.

37:23.993 --> 37:28.664
- Dante, I...
- Not interested.

37:28.748 --> 37:30.583
You think you go home now,
you don't.

37:30.666 --> 37:34.420
- You go into the system.
- We'll see.

37:34.503 --> 37:36.714
Even if he gets you released,
which... okay,

37:36.797 --> 37:39.467
maybe somehow he does,
this doesn't stop.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.010
You think Saul's
just gonna give up?

37:41.093 --> 37:42.261
He knows you're a spy.

37:42.345 --> 37:43.763
Only I'm not.

37:43.846 --> 37:46.223
Everywhere you go,
you will be monitored.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.101
Every phone call, every text,
every minute of your life

37:49.185 --> 37:50.561
till you're behind bars.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.396
Where is he? Here?

37:52.480 --> 37:55.358
Can you open the door, please?

37:55.441 --> 37:58.277
This is it. Last chance.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.366
What are you doing here?

38:03.449 --> 38:06.160
Did he or did he not request
the presence of an attorney?

38:18.381 --> 38:20.841
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

38:20.925 --> 38:23.344
Didn't Joe Toibin tell you
not to talk to anyone?

38:23.427 --> 38:26.180
<i>I'm not an idiot.
I didn't say anything.</i>

38:26.263 --> 38:28.057
<i>Where's Joe?</i>

38:28.140 --> 38:29.976
<i>He got called
to New York this morning.</i>

38:30.059 --> 38:32.395
Said it was urgent.
I'm subbing in.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.063
Pat Steyer.

38:34.146 --> 38:37.066
Just get me out of here.
This whole thing's a farce.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.652
Yeah, Joe filled me in on
everything that you told him.

38:39.735 --> 38:43.364
I drew up a motion demanding
your immediate release.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.366
Check the details there.

38:45.449 --> 38:48.703
"Statement of facts"--
make sure that's accurate.

38:48.786 --> 38:53.416
I got a judge that hates
this Gestapo shit.

38:53.499 --> 38:56.293
They broke down your door in
the middle of the night, right?

39:07.805 --> 39:09.473
Good. All goes well,

39:09.557 --> 39:12.101
I'll have you out of here
in a couple of hours.

39:12.184 --> 39:15.271
Then we can discuss next moves,
which, in my opinion,

39:15.354 --> 39:16.897
involves us seeking
seven-figure damages

39:16.981 --> 39:19.400
for violation
of your civil rights.

39:19.483 --> 39:24.530
Until then, though,
seriously, don't say anything.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.734
Mm.

40:08.199 --> 40:10.159
<i>Ah.</i>

40:37.686 --> 40:39.730
Mm.

40:39.814 --> 40:42.233
Help!

40:44.235 --> 40:45.486
Wait.

40:51.158 --> 40:53.536
Help me!

40:53.619 --> 40:55.287
<i>Help!</i>

40:57.123 --> 40:58.415
Help!

41:04.213 --> 41:05.506
We need help. Get a med kit.

41:05.589 --> 41:07.216
- Help me.
- Dante.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.802
Please help me.
Please help. Please.

41:09.885 --> 41:12.680
Okay, hang on.
You just gotta hang on.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.057
I think he's having
a heart attack. Call 9-1-1.

41:15.141 --> 41:18.310
- Ma'am--
- Don't tell me protocol. Do it.

41:18.394 --> 41:20.771
Okay, Dante, I think
you're having a heart attack.

41:20.855 --> 41:23.691
<i>You just gotta hang on
until the ambulance arrives.</i>

41:23.774 --> 41:25.151
- All right? I'm here with you.
- No.

41:25.234 --> 41:26.652
Okay, you gotta take these
right now.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.195
- No. No.
- Right now.

41:28.279 --> 41:32.074
It's poison. Poison. Poison.

41:35.077 --> 41:36.620
It's the pen.

41:36.704 --> 41:38.914
The lawyer.
The lawyer.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.293
Stop him! That attorney,

41:42.376 --> 41:46.630
<i>don't let him leave!</i>

41:51.302 --> 41:52.511
Like McClendon.

41:52.595 --> 41:55.639
<i>Russians.</i>

41:55.723 --> 41:57.224
<i>How do you know?</i>

42:01.145 --> 42:02.479
Si-Simone.

42:02.563 --> 42:05.900
Simone told me.

42:51.779 --> 42:53.489
Did we get what we need?

42:53.572 --> 42:56.033
He said McClendon
was poisoned by Russians.

42:56.116 --> 42:58.994
- He named Simone.
- Does that get you your warrant?

42:59.078 --> 43:00.996
Yes. He just better survive.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.457
The antidote doesn't take
long to work.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.626
I wanna be here
when he wakes up.

43:05.709 --> 43:08.212
Come on. We need to get
to a judge.

43:17.137 --> 43:18.555
Fuck.

43:25.604 --> 43:26.855
What is it?

43:26.939 --> 43:29.650
- His heart stopped.
- Fuck.

43:29.733 --> 43:31.610
- Call 9-1-1.
- For real?

43:31.694 --> 43:33.070
His heart stopped! Do it.

43:33.153 --> 43:35.781
There's a defib in the bag.
Red case.

43:35.864 --> 43:37.574
Yeah.

43:40.119 --> 43:42.579
- Can you take over?
- Yeah, here.

43:49.712 --> 43:51.255
Clear.

45:18.717 --> 45:21.720
We got movement on the south
perimeter. I'll need cover.

45:57.047 --> 45:58.966
<i>- Madam President.
- Saul.</i>

45:59.049 --> 46:01.093
Good news finally.
We have a warrant for

46:01.176 --> 46:03.512
- Simone Martin's arrest.
- Oh, thank God.

46:03.595 --> 46:06.390
They have
a warrant for Simone's arrest.

46:06.473 --> 46:08.934
Saul, it's David.
That's great news.

46:09.017 --> 46:10.686
<i>I'm on my way
to question her now.</i>

46:10.769 --> 46:13.105
- How did you manage it?
- We have an FBI agent

46:13.188 --> 46:15.023
who confirmed
Simone's a Russian spy.

46:15.107 --> 46:17.151
Beyond that,
better you don't know.

46:17.234 --> 46:20.446
- But we did it. We got her.
- You wanna tell him?

46:20.529 --> 46:21.864
<i>Excuse me?</i>

46:21.947 --> 46:24.158
Saul, we've reached out
to the Russians ourselves.

46:24.241 --> 46:25.701
How?

46:25.784 --> 46:27.119
<i>I spoke to the Ambassador,</i>

46:27.202 --> 46:28.620
<i>put some pressure on.</i>

46:28.704 --> 46:31.832
We wanted a backup plan to--
Doesn't really matter now.

46:31.915 --> 46:35.294
When you exerted this pressure,
did you mention Simone by name?

46:35.377 --> 46:39.923
Of course. That was the idea.
Keep her from testifying.

46:40.007 --> 46:42.050
Saul, is that a problem?

46:43.427 --> 46:45.554
<i>Tell me.</i>

46:45.637 --> 46:47.681
You just put a target
on her back.

46:52.811 --> 46:55.647
Get after them.

46:57.483 --> 46:58.775
Go, go.

47:19.963 --> 47:21.882
- They got her.
- What happened?

47:21.965 --> 47:24.092
They ran a decoy out front,
came in the back.

47:24.176 --> 47:26.553
We're fanning out,
looking for 'em.

48:14.101 --> 48:16.603
Oh!

48:35.122 --> 48:37.124
<i>- Hello?</i>
- She's gone.

48:37.207 --> 48:40.836
<i>- What?</i>
- They got to her.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.170
The Russians did.

48:42.254 --> 48:44.881
Now Dante's all we've got.

48:44.965 --> 48:47.759
<i>Carrie?</i>

48:47.843 --> 48:49.428
I-I'm gonna have
to get back to you.

48:49.511 --> 48:53.307
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- His heart stopped.

48:55.309 --> 48:58.228
- What?
- His heart stopped.

48:58.312 --> 49:01.523
It's-it's going now,
but we're in the E.R.

49:03.358 --> 49:05.360
Tell me he's gonna make it.

49:25.297 --> 49:27.299
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to step out.
