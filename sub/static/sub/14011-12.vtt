DEMONSTRATORS:
Don't kill your babies!
Abortion is a sin!

00:20.154 --> 00:27.092
Don't kill your babies!
Abortion is a sin!

00:27.094 --> 00:29.294
Do they ever get bored?

00:29.296 --> 00:30.462
The true believers?

00:30.464 --> 00:32.031
Not on your life.

00:33.367 --> 00:38.237
Don't kill your babies!
Abortion is a sin!

00:38.239 --> 00:41.607
Don't kill your babies!
Abortion is a sin!

00:41.609 --> 00:45.344
Don't kill your babies!
Abortion is a sin!

00:45.346 --> 00:49.214
Don't kill your babies!
Abortion is a sin!

00:49.216 --> 00:52.351
Don't kill your babies!

Past 24 weeks?

00:59.126 --> 01:00.392
We can't help you.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.628
Well, I'm not sure.

01:02.630 --> 01:06.131
Okay, fill this out
and you can see the nurse.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.132

Women's Choices.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.438
God! Not again.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.407
...so my father says,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.375
"if you weren't a cop,
you'd get a husband.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.410
Who told you to be a cop?"

01:18.412 --> 01:19.511
And my mother says,

01:19.513 --> 01:21.413
<i> "I</i> told her to be a cop

01:21.415 --> 01:23.415
"so she wouldn't
have to worry

01:23.417 --> 01:25.150
about getting a husband."

01:25.152 --> 01:26.518
You could always marry me.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.521
You're not what
my father had in mind.

I knew this would happen.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.669
Don't panic.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.671
It'll be all right.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.306
Take it easy.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.440
Don't stop.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.675
Out. Now.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.111
That's everybody.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.486

03:27.374 --> 03:30.275
(<i> sirens wailing</i> )

03:33.714 --> 03:34.947
I'm only asking

03:34.949 --> 03:37.716
if you saw anybody
carrying something--

03:37.718 --> 03:39.985
a knapsack, a package,
a large bag--

03:39.987 --> 03:42.254
anything out
of the ordinary.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.724
Yo!

03:45.726 --> 03:47.292
Good morning, Vietnam.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.594
What do we got?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.596
Your garden variety
lunatic--

03:50.597 --> 03:52.597
blowing up a room
with a lot of ladies in it.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.298
The bomb.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.801
Your basic pipe.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.403
Fertilizer and diesel?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.605
You got it--

03:59.607 --> 04:00.906
amateur hour.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.941
Terrific! The only thing
I like more than a bomber

04:02.943 --> 04:04.009
is an amateur bomber.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.278
Timer?
Quartz alarm clock

04:06.280 --> 04:08.680
straight out of
<i> The Revolutionary Cookbook.</i>

04:08.682 --> 04:11.283
Yeah, well,
if that's the main course,

04:11.285 --> 04:12.718
I can't wait
to see dessert.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.621
There won't be any dessert
for this one.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.322
Student I.D.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.991
University of Manhattan.

04:18.993 --> 04:22.027
Sandra Turner...
21, 22 maybe.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.630
She was in the bathroom.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.732
Was she here for an abortion?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.634
Doesn't play that way.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.002
She didn't sign in.

04:30.004 --> 04:31.970
Nobody saw her.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.773
Looks like she
was the delivery girl

04:34.775 --> 04:37.342
but she didn't get out
quick enough.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.845
Put her right through the wall.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.913
We get calls all the time.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.749
False alarms, but still,
we get everybody out.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.917
And did you recognize the voice
on the phone before?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.653
She only said, "bomb."

04:47.655 --> 04:49.788
How could I recognize her voice?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.390
What about the girl
in the bathroom-- Turner.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.758
She fill out a form?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.862
No way.
I didn't see her.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.363
She wasn't a patient.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.966
They can't wait
to talk to somebody.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.936
She must have
carried the bomb in.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.006
What is wrong with these people?

05:08.008 --> 05:10.776
Sooner or later,
had to happen.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.044
As long as the courts

05:12.046 --> 05:14.046
keep refusing to act
against abortion,

05:14.048 --> 05:16.048
there are gonna be
individuals...

05:16.050 --> 05:18.016
What, are you defending
these nuts?

05:18.018 --> 05:20.686
Come on!
This ain't lone justice.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.887
It's a conspiracy.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.388
They can't stop abortion
through the courts,

05:23.390 --> 05:24.790
so they'll bomb a few clinics.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.024
We don't know that.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.326
We don't?

05:27.328 --> 05:28.544
Well, I don't remember
reading anything

05:28.545 --> 05:29.761
about a cellular phone
in the bathroom.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
Somebody called in a warning.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.765
Two people make a conspiracy.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.334
Look, all I'm saying

05:35.336 --> 05:38.770
is I understand
why they're frustrated.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.906
Max, a girl's dead.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.342
She was 22 years old.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.377
Tell them to write their
congressman, not throw bombs.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.912
I'm only saying

05:46.914 --> 05:48.914
they believe in something
and they're angry.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.432
They're angry?!

05:50.433 --> 05:51.949
So they send a girl in there
with a bomb?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.051
In my book,

05:53.053 --> 05:56.455
that is not frustration,
that's murder.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.427
Eight bombings
in the last seven months,

06:02.429 --> 06:04.413
all of 'em at night.

06:04.414 --> 06:06.398
None of them happened
in the daytime.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.734
Nobody was hurt before, either.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.738
We got six active
anti-abortion protest groups

06:12.740 --> 06:14.973
with offices in Manhattan.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.878
Let's see if the M.E.'s
got an I.D.,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.913
then we'll start on these.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.450
Whatever she used,
it did a real job on her.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.119
Anybody come
to I.D. her?

06:27.121 --> 06:28.754
LOGAN:
No prints?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.756
Epithelial layer's gone.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.125
I could get better prints
from charcoal.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.761
You'll have
a preliminary report
tomorrow, but, uh...

06:35.763 --> 06:40.432
there's not much doubt
about the C.O.D.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.072
That's it?
Cash? No wallet?

06:47.074 --> 06:50.409
Just the university I.D.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.486
Nobody on this student number.

07:01.488 --> 07:05.791
LOGAN:
Try "Turner, Sandra."

07:05.793 --> 07:09.494
We haven't had six-digit I.D.'s
in two years.

07:09.496 --> 07:13.932
"Turner, Samuel...
Turner, Sheila..."

07:13.934 --> 07:16.201
no "Turner, Sandra."

07:16.203 --> 07:19.938
But this<i> is</i> the
university's card.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.072
No, it isn't.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.508
This picture is glued on.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.810
It's a fake.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.812
The real ones
are like a license--

07:26.814 --> 07:28.814
all one piece.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.082
Back to square one.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.519
Let's hit some of those
anti-abortion groups.

07:34.521 --> 07:35.821
"O" for three.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.956
Number four,
"Women for Life,"

07:37.958 --> 07:40.025
headed by Rose Schwimmer.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.232
Our battle isn't about
restoring Central Park

07:47.234 --> 07:49.835
or a 15Â¢ increase
in the subway fare

07:49.837 --> 07:51.069
or separating cans

07:51.071 --> 07:53.038
and bottles
from our trash.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.573
It's about
human life.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.476
Sometimes people
go out of bounds.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.178
Do you ever
go out of bounds?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.213
All the time.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.248
That's why I'm here.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.549
You're here
to break the law?

08:04.551 --> 08:06.885
I'm here to stop
the murder of babies.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.254
Look, let's get this clear.

08:09.256 --> 08:12.624
Abortion is a<i> right </i>
in this country.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.527
Okay?
That clinic was performing

08:15.529 --> 08:17.996
a legal and medical procedure.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.499
They weren't
murdering anything.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.267
Mrs. Schwimmer,

08:22.269 --> 08:24.903
a girl is dead.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.939
The clinic is just a couple of
minutes away from here.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.575
I'm horrified by what happened.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.645
But you sympathize,
don't you?

08:33.647 --> 08:36.214
I mean, with people who bomb
abortion clinics?

08:36.216 --> 08:39.918
I don't condone violence,
but I understand.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.555
Does a woman named Sandra Turner
belong to your group?

08:43.557 --> 08:46.591
Would you hand me that folder
over there, please?

08:47.895 --> 08:50.562
We have over
2,000 active members,

08:50.564 --> 08:53.565
and a couple thousand more
come to our vigils

08:53.567 --> 08:56.101
and send
contributions.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.170
No Sandra Turner.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.605
Where were you

09:00.607 --> 09:03.174
when the bomb
went off?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.876
Why?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.279
People from your group were
picketing that day.

09:07.281 --> 09:10.649
Am I a suspect, Detective?

09:12.286 --> 09:16.321
Lazy Jane's, around the corner,
having tea.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.059
I guess when you go against
the system, the way we do,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.562
you're guilty
until proven innocent.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.299
She comes
every Wednesday.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.934
Rose Schwimmer.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.336
She came in between
10:00 and 11:00.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.071
Are you sure
of the time?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.307
Why do you think it's
called Lazy Jane's?

09:35.309 --> 09:37.342
I don't get in
till 10:00.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.077
So, what, she came
right after you?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.380
10:15, 10:30.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.682
Her friend came in
a couple of minutes later.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.217
The friend
a regular too?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.620
Semi-- couple
of times a month.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.221
You know the look--

09:50.223 --> 09:53.358
Raggedy Ann
with a Bendel's charge card.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
She's a real pro shopper.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.662
She had this big box
with her.

09:57.664 --> 09:58.964
A box?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.232
She put it
right on the table.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.968
Can you believe that?

10:02.970 --> 10:05.670
I mean, it was the size
of a toaster oven.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.372
I put it on the chair.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.074
This isn't a diner.

10:09.076 --> 10:13.345
Watch-- five years,
they'll legalize drugs.

10:13.347 --> 10:14.679
Maybe, maybe not.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.681
It's a great country, Max.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.183
You can do
what you want,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.684
when you want,
with who you want.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.354
Which means if a woman
wants an abortion

10:22.356 --> 10:23.688
she can get one.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.290
Just because she
was careless enough

10:25.292 --> 10:27.359
to get knocked up
in the first place?

10:27.361 --> 10:29.995
Are you against
abortions, or sex?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.363
Abortions.
I like sex.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.682
So, a 17-year-old

10:33.683 --> 10:36.000
should louse up
her whole life
by having a kid?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.703
A 17-year-old shouldn't be
doing what makes babies.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.006
And crooks shouldn't
have guns! Get real!

10:41.008 --> 10:43.408
Come on! What they should
be is more careful.

10:43.410 --> 10:47.345
Kids aren't careful.
That's why they're kids.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.216
Mrs. Schwimmer
didn't mention

10:51.218 --> 10:55.220
that she had tea with
Miss Toaster Oven.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.354
I get it.

10:56.356 --> 11:00.025
Now every pro-life protester
is a bomber?

11:00.027 --> 11:03.161
You agree with
them, don't you.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.429
Okay, Don Juan.

11:04.431 --> 11:08.166
Any of your girlfriends
ever have an abortion?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.434
One ex-girlfriend

11:09.436 --> 11:12.037
who's now married
with two kids--

11:12.039 --> 11:13.672
neither of them mine.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.315
I really don't
have time for this.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.750
Yeah, well, I hate
to bother you,

11:25.752 --> 11:28.319
but it is a little weird
that no one saw her.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.056
Really? If I
was planting a bomb

11:31.058 --> 11:33.324
I'd sure try to be invisible.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.193
That's all the cards.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.195
There's no Sandra Turner.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.330
I told you she
didn't sign in.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.267
How much does an abortion cost?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.469
Three hundred dollars.

11:45.439 --> 11:49.207
300 bucks-- the price
of a cheap Mob hit.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.043
Hey, Max, look at that.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.746
GREEVEY:
Yo! How many they take away?

11:54.748 --> 11:57.115
12, 15.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.085
Let's go to
the property clerk's office

12:00.087 --> 12:02.487
and pick up
the dead girl's keys.

12:08.462 --> 12:11.329
We got two right here.

12:11.331 --> 12:15.433
Ooh! Whoa!

12:15.435 --> 12:18.103
How sweet it is.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.871
I could get used
to driving this.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.507
On your salary, you couldn't
afford the repairs.

12:22.509 --> 12:26.111
On my salary, I couldn't
even afford the insurance.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.746
Bingo!

12:30.183 --> 12:33.284
"Chelsea Women's
Choices Center."

12:33.286 --> 12:35.420
Let's get the crime
scene unit down here.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.522
Maybe we'll get lucky
and pull some prints.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.790
Yeah.

12:38.792 --> 12:39.824
Come on.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.127
Don't give yourself
an ulcer.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.466
Four twenty-two.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.409
(<i> knocking</i> )

13:02.415 --> 13:03.548
Mr. Donovan?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.383
Yes?

13:05.384 --> 13:07.217
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.560
When she didn't
come home last night,

13:15.562 --> 13:18.429
we tried to file
a missing person report.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.431
They wouldn't take it.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.234
They said we had
to wait two days.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.522
(<i> moaning</i> )

13:46.459 --> 13:49.861
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.263
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

13:52.265 --> 13:54.165
on earth,
as it is in Heaven.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.835
Give us this day our
daily bread, and forgive us
our trespasses,

13:56.837 --> 13:58.203
as we forgive those
who trespass...

14:03.476 --> 14:05.510
Your daughter--
(<i> clears throat</i> )

14:05.512 --> 14:07.612
did she belong
to a right-to-life group?

14:07.614 --> 14:11.115
The thing
about Mary...

14:11.117 --> 14:12.517
she loves kids.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.485
That's why
she teaches.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.187
Did Mary
ever mention

14:16.189 --> 14:18.056
Women for Life?

14:18.058 --> 14:21.059
FATHER:
She was sympathetic
to their work, their ideals.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.560
We all are.

14:22.562 --> 14:26.531
Did anyone tell the school
Mary wouldn't be in today?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.399
It's okay, Barbara.

14:28.401 --> 14:32.136
Could Mary have,
without your knowledge...

14:32.138 --> 14:35.473
Mary didn't keep
secrets from us.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.477
We know how hard it is

14:39.479 --> 14:43.114
but we'd like to look
at Mary's room.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.117
Mary has a thing
about privacy.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.553
Barbara,
it doesn't matter

14:48.555 --> 14:51.522
if they go
into her room now.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.428
<i> The Lives of the Saints.</i>

14:57.430 --> 14:59.564
22 years old.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.534
Who sends a kid
to deliver a bomb?

15:05.906 --> 15:08.439
Maybe it was
her own idea.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.174
Yeah?

15:10.176 --> 15:12.577
Who taught her
how to make one?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.914
Whoever it was, they should've
taught her about timers.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.583
The mother seems to be taking it
pretty hard.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.185
It's going
to take a while.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.554
What, to realize
that her daughter is dead?

15:23.556 --> 15:26.190
To realize she didn't die
with her.

15:26.192 --> 15:29.928
Father doesn't seem to be having
that problem.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.562
That's because

15:31.564 --> 15:34.332
he didn't lose a daughter...

15:34.334 --> 15:36.634
he gained a martyr.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.672
Hey.

15:40.674 --> 15:44.575
Looks like the brother
owns a lumber company.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.579
Lumber... construction.

15:48.581 --> 15:52.583
Construction... explosives.

15:52.585 --> 15:56.321
Anything you can tell us
about Mary's friends,

15:56.323 --> 15:58.957
teachers she
was close to?

15:58.959 --> 16:00.959
My father...

16:00.961 --> 16:04.228
poured himself a cup
of coffee this morning

16:04.230 --> 16:07.365
put in milk, sugar,
walked over to the sink,

16:07.367 --> 16:09.634
poured it down
the drain.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.503
He didn't know
what the hell
he was doing.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.640
I got on the West Side
Highway on my way here.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.608
I forgot
to get off.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.446
Went the whole way
to 96th Street.

16:21.448 --> 16:26.484
Just like that,
I had a sister and now I don't.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.654
Was there only
the two of you?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.991
Mary always said
she'd have a big family.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.661
What about these
anti-abortion groups?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.396
She loved kids.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.632
She belong
to any organized groups?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.434
Mr. Donovan,

16:43.436 --> 16:45.003
bombing is a felony.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.238
Fine! I think Mary's
paid for her crime in full.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.473
Don't you, Detective?

16:48.475 --> 16:51.476
We don't happen to think
she was in this alone.

16:51.478 --> 16:55.313
Don't you want the people
who helped to kill your sister

16:55.315 --> 16:56.581
to pay too?

16:56.583 --> 16:59.017
If she was the member
of a group,

16:59.019 --> 17:01.719
she never mentioned it to me.

17:01.721 --> 17:07.492
They might know more at school--
St. Aloysius.

17:07.494 --> 17:11.429
Some people take a long time
to grow up.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.398
Have a seat.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.635
They still believe
in hearts and flowers

17:17.637 --> 17:20.505
and Mom never looks
at another guy.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.608
Dad doesn't cheat
on his income tax.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.576
For 22, Mary was... young.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.745
Young enough
to let somebody

17:27.747 --> 17:30.515
talk her into throwing a bomb?

17:30.517 --> 17:34.218
Gentlemen, a parochial school
like this, it's...

17:34.220 --> 17:35.686
it's another century.

17:35.688 --> 17:39.290
Mary was
a sweet kid.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.626
She believed that the whole
world was parochial school.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.294
That all the problems
could be solved

17:43.296 --> 17:44.662
with pure thoughts and a rosary.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.564
Did, uh...

17:46.566 --> 17:48.699
did you know that she wasn't
going to be here yesterday?

17:48.701 --> 17:50.435
Day off.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.502
Regular day off?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.571
No;
you know how hard it is

17:53.573 --> 17:55.807
to get good teachers these days?

17:55.809 --> 17:58.676
They ask for a day off,
they get it.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.511
Did she happen

18:00.513 --> 18:02.246
to tell you why?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.614
Well, she'd been upset.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.617
I figured it was her boyfriend,
Patrick Dunne.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.319
He teaches here.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.654
Eighth grade Latin.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.356
Last week, they had an argument
in the hallway,

18:12.358 --> 18:14.892
in front of the kids.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.427
I had to tell them this
is not appropriate behavior.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.597
She shouldn't have been there.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.332
It's crazy.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.600
So, Patrick,

18:22.602 --> 18:25.436
this fight you had last week--

18:25.438 --> 18:27.605
what was that all about?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.607
Some article
in the<i> Times.</i>

18:29.609 --> 18:32.610
Connecticut's abortion law.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.579
Mary hated abortion.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.514
<i> Hated</i> it.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.782
You?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.617
Why?

18:41.354 --> 18:45.656
Personally, I think it's a sin
and I think it's immoral

18:45.658 --> 18:48.693
but I live in the real world.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.529
Did she ever
mention a woman

18:51.531 --> 18:53.764
named Rose Schwimmer?

18:53.766 --> 18:55.900
Women for Life.

18:55.902 --> 18:59.770
Everyone knows who she is.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.406
If you're asking
whether I carry

19:02.408 --> 19:05.376
false identification,
Detectives, the answer is no.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.378
I'm proud of what I do.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.713
Anybody in your
group have any?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.748
Please.
Thank you.

19:12.752 --> 19:17.922
This movement attracts
deeply committed individuals.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.391
They get arrested.

19:20.393 --> 19:24.395
Some carry false identification
and jump bail.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.763
And Mary Donovan?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.699
Obviously deeply committed.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.701
But you didn't even know her.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.670
No, I didn't.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.640
But what I do know
is that Mary Donovan,

19:35.642 --> 19:37.642
whoever she was,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.912
sacrificed herself
to save the unborn.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.780
Hundreds of them.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.616
I don't approve
of her methods

19:45.618 --> 19:47.652
but I applaud her results.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.721
The day of the bombing,
when you had brunch,

19:50.723 --> 19:53.658
you didn't mention
someone else being there...

19:53.660 --> 19:56.694
who happened to be carrying
a large package.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.797
This morning,
i had breakfast with my sister.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.433
She carried an umbrella.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.802
I didn't tell you that either.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.704
Loo, we're just trying

20:06.706 --> 20:08.673
to do our job here.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.375
We have to verify alibis.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.879
I had brunch with an associate,
Celeste McClure.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.715
Uh, this Miss McClure--

20:17.717 --> 20:21.485
you know where we can find her?

20:21.487 --> 20:22.853
Today?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.755
Probably at
the community garden,

20:24.757 --> 20:26.691
near the stables on 89th Street.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.427
Just came from the printer.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.664
Great, isn't it?

20:33.666 --> 20:36.234
It's wonderful.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.704
It depends
on what you're selling.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.774
You're mistaken, Detective.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.678
I didn't know Mary Donovan,
but I wish I had.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.413
What she did--

20:49.415 --> 20:50.781
it makes me proud.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.683
Throwing a bomb?

20:52.685 --> 20:55.786
Innocent people
could've been killed.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.755
In that building,

20:57.757 --> 21:00.758
before Mary Donovan
threw that bomb,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.861
unborn babies were
being killed every day.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.731
At Lazy Jane's, when you had
brunch with Rose Schwimmer,

21:06.733 --> 21:09.500
what was in
the box you had?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.969
Leaflets.
For protesters.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.704
I'm trying
to save lives.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.606
You're supposed
to save lives.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.775
We're investigating...

21:17.776 --> 21:19.943
A woman who gave her life
in the only cause that counts.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.012
Look, nobody's trying...

21:21.014 --> 21:22.813
You wear a
wedding ring.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.815
You have children?

21:24.817 --> 21:28.719
Would you want your daughter
or your wife

21:28.721 --> 21:31.022
to have an abortion?

21:31.024 --> 21:32.790
No,

21:32.792 --> 21:36.527
but I wouldn't want them
tossing bombs either.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.731
If you don't have
any more questions,

21:40.733 --> 21:42.800
I have work to do.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.510
Hmm, ammonium nitrate.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.646
Now all she needs
is the diesel fuel.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.649
Hey, you know, that's
a good question she asked

21:58.651 --> 21:59.784
about your daughter.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.585
Suppose some boyfriend
knocked her up?

22:01.587 --> 22:02.987
Look...
we are not

22:02.989 --> 22:04.389
investigating
my daughter,

22:04.390 --> 22:05.790
my sex life
with my wife,

22:05.792 --> 22:08.592
or my opinions on contraception!

22:08.594 --> 22:10.828
We are investigating the bombing
of an abortion clinic.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.930
Let's just stick
to the job, all right?

22:17.737 --> 22:20.338
MAN:
<i> Petersen's 121-- nitrate.</i>

22:20.340 --> 22:22.740
Where'd you get that?

22:22.742 --> 22:25.743
What, I don't look like
I have a green thumb to you?

22:25.745 --> 22:28.012
You must be one
hell of a gardener.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.880
You grow palm trees
in your backyard?

22:29.882 --> 22:31.749
This stuff's
for tropical plants.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.850
New York?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.052
A big item
in Hawaii.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.759
Quite a record Miss Schwimmer's

22:41.761 --> 22:43.627
got here, huh?

22:43.629 --> 22:45.896
Trespassing,
disturbing the peace,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.631
harassment.

22:47.633 --> 22:51.535
For such a "non-violent person,"
she sure does get around.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.137
I've seen
armed robbers

22:53.139 --> 22:57.675
who got shorter
rap sheets than this.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.945
McClure's got nothing
but a dismissed trespass.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.713
It's a big step

23:02.715 --> 23:04.949
from there
to armed robbery.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.050
Yeah? Well, Donovan's
completely clean.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.403
She doesn't even
have a traffic ticket.

23:08.404 --> 23:10.755
But she was willing to go all
the way up to arson and murder,

23:10.757 --> 23:13.274
even with Mr. Clean
for her boyfriend.

23:13.275 --> 23:15.792
The methods are wrong,
but they're trying to prevent...

23:15.795 --> 23:17.862
Come on, spare me the rhetoric,
all right, man?

23:17.864 --> 23:19.964
I don't consider abortion
murder.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.633
If a woman wants one,
that's her right to choose.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.801
Not yours, not mine

23:23.803 --> 23:25.903
and certainly not
Miss Rose Schwimmer.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.572
I don't care what you believe,

23:28.574 --> 23:31.075
trying to prevent
abortions by bombing

23:31.077 --> 23:32.777
goes way too far--
I don't even know

23:32.779 --> 23:34.678
how you can even sit here
and defend it!

23:34.680 --> 23:36.714
You and I both know
they didn't mean to hurt...

23:36.716 --> 23:38.682
No, I don't know that,
okay?!

23:38.684 --> 23:40.584
Only an idiot thinks

23:40.586 --> 23:41.919
bombs don't
hurt people!

23:41.921 --> 23:43.621
Come on, tell me
more-- come on!

23:43.623 --> 23:44.922
Lab report just came in.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.824
The fertilizer's a match

23:46.826 --> 23:49.927
on the bomb, and they got
a bunch of good, latent prints

23:49.929 --> 23:51.913
on the bag--
all the same woman.

23:51.914 --> 23:53.898
And they're a match for the
partial on the bomb fragment.

23:53.900 --> 23:57.067
Now, if you two could manage
not to kill each other,

23:57.069 --> 24:00.805
maybe you could pick up McClure
and see if her prints match.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.181
We're not saying
it's a slam dunk.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.817
Slam dunk?! A bag of fertilizer
and a couple of prints?

24:12.819 --> 24:14.919
Right now, I'd have a hard time
convicting Celeste McClure

24:14.921 --> 24:16.554
of bad gardening.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.188
I'm trying to make this work
beyond just an indictment.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.524
You don't like it, don't file.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.193
That's just fine with me.

24:22.195 --> 24:25.062
You in favor of people
planting bombs, Sargeant?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.097
Careful, Counselor.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.666
All I'm saying

24:28.668 --> 24:31.068
is that these women
are true believers,

24:31.070 --> 24:33.504
and, so far, they've hurt no one
but each other.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.873
Yeah, talk about dumb luck.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.478
Gentlemen.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.083
McClure made the bomb.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.151
Donovan muled it.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.986
Schwimmer ordered it.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.221
You want my advice?

24:50.223 --> 24:52.056
Offer McClure a plea.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.157
She'll take it.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.159
She wants to be a martyr.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.498
JUDGE:
Celeste McClure,
the charges are conspiracy

25:00.500 --> 25:03.234
in the third degree,
reckless endangerment

25:03.236 --> 25:07.104
in the second degree,
arson in the second degree.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.939
How does the defendant plead
on the first count?

25:08.941 --> 25:10.908
Not guilty on all
counts, Your Honor.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.244
We request release
of the defendant on
her own recognizance.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.212
Based upon what, Mr. Ballard?

25:15.214 --> 25:18.249
These are two serious
felony charges here.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.985
Based on that fact that this is
a political prosecution.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.287
You're not on trial yet,
Counselor.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.222
Your Honor,
if it please the court,

25:25.224 --> 25:26.957
Miss McClure is a young woman

25:26.959 --> 25:28.225
with no previous
criminal record

25:28.227 --> 25:30.194
and close ties
to the community.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.996
Mr. Stone?

25:31.998 --> 25:34.732
People have no objection
to minimum bail, Your Honor.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.202
Then bail is set at $10,000,
cash or bond.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.203
Short date.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.938
(<i> Judge bangs gavel</i> )

25:42.308 --> 25:44.742
BALLARD:
Thanks for the bail
recommendation.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.610
STONE:
Not at all, sir.
Martyrs don't run.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.280
How can you allow yourself
to be used like this?

25:49.282 --> 25:52.750
If you're going to stick
your finger in my eye,
Mr. Ballard,

25:52.752 --> 25:55.019
clean your own nails first.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.688
It seems to me the only reason
for this prosecution

25:57.690 --> 25:59.957
is to make the right-to-life
movement look bad.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.592
That will get you
in the papers

26:01.594 --> 26:03.961
but it won't help
your client and
it's not true.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.964
Look, McClure didn't plant
that bomb, Mary Donovan did.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.116
McClure made the bomb.

26:09.117 --> 26:11.267
The best you can get,
if you believe she's guilty:

26:11.270 --> 26:13.037
conspiracy six,
arson four.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.940
Are you accusing me of
filing inflated charges?

26:15.942 --> 26:18.309
I'm only saying you're
going to cost the state
a lot of money,

26:18.311 --> 26:20.210
merely to get her
on probation.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.613
If probation will keep
a bomb out of that
woman's hands,

26:22.615 --> 26:23.781
I think it's worth
the money.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.316
These people
aren't criminals.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.318
What are they?
Mary Poppins?
Mother Theresa?

26:27.320 --> 26:30.654
They are exercising
their right of free speech.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.356
Throwing a bomb is
a little non-verbal

26:32.358 --> 26:34.258
to qualify
as speech, sir.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.228
Sure you don't want
to recuse yourself?

26:38.230 --> 26:39.229
That's insulting.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.965
I'm personally
against abortion

26:40.967 --> 26:43.233
means I can't prosecute
a bomber?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.336
What I believe doesn't matter.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.137
I represent the law.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.138
Amazing.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.007
I'm getting angry.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.810
It's the most emotional issue

26:52.812 --> 26:57.348
that the law has dealt with
since suffrage.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.333
Look at us--

26:59.334 --> 27:01.317
three men talking
about what rights

27:01.320 --> 27:04.622
women should have
over their own bodies.

27:04.624 --> 27:08.092
Now, doesn't that strike you
as a little one-sided?

27:08.094 --> 27:09.326
Adam, I've already told you

27:09.328 --> 27:11.328
my personal feelings
have no impact

27:11.330 --> 27:13.097
on my ability
to prosecute a criminal case.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.299
And I have never said
that a woman does not have

27:15.301 --> 27:16.300
the right to choose.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.335
SCHIFF:
Fine. Wonderful.

27:18.337 --> 27:22.640
You feeling shaky
on the conspiracy charge?

27:22.642 --> 27:26.176
You better tie
the bomb maker
to the bomber

27:26.178 --> 27:28.145
with a little more
than what you got there.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.715
We prove McClure made the bomb,
Donovan delivered it...

27:31.717 --> 27:33.150
And what about Schwimmer?

27:33.152 --> 27:35.019
That's flimsy.
STONE:
And it's risky.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.187
We tie her into the picture,
it doesn't work...

27:37.189 --> 27:39.123
I wouldn't go even
for an indictment

27:39.125 --> 27:40.324
with what we got now.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.393
But?
It is a conspiracy,

27:42.395 --> 27:44.194
and I want
to make it stick!

27:44.196 --> 27:46.130
Forensics ever send over
a print report?

27:46.132 --> 27:48.132
Finally. There's another
set of prints

27:48.134 --> 27:50.668
along with Mary Donovan's
on that I.D. card.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.403
We don't figure out
who they belong to,

27:52.405 --> 27:55.139
Ballard will say someone else
was in league with Mary.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.307
Yeah, get a print workup
on everybody who knew her.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.209
You argue with Schiff
a lot on this.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.761
Yeah.
You agree with him?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.312
Oh, come on, Ben, that's
not an issue for me.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.781
I'm not for abortion,
I'm for birth control.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.249
I got your fertilizer.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.851
Make me happy.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.452
McClure bought one bag
from the same supplier

28:08.454 --> 28:10.421
who sells to the
community garden.

28:10.423 --> 28:11.855
Ordered it herself.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.258
She didn't happen
to sign the...

28:14.260 --> 28:17.294
You just made me very happy.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.396
The only deal
we're interested in

28:19.398 --> 28:22.132
is you drop everything, don't
even go to the grand jury.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.467
Put your emotions
in your briefcase

28:23.469 --> 28:24.468
for a couple of minutes.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.470
This case is
about emotion.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.206
I hope you know your law
better than that, Mr. Ballard.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.442
I know juries
are swayed by it.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.711
It's your gamble, Mr. Ballard.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.814
Miss McClure,
you and Mary Donovan

28:36.816 --> 28:38.415
bombed the clinic.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.852
Mary Donovan is dead
and you're not.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.196
She's a nice young lady.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.464
She made a mistake.

28:53.466 --> 28:56.200
I hope you're
not going to let her

28:56.202 --> 28:58.335
take the fall
all by herself.

28:58.337 --> 29:01.271
All she has to do
is name who ordered it.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.274
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.509
The babies matter.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.845
Arson in
the second degree

29:07.847 --> 29:09.513
is a Class B felony.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.415
I assume Mr. Ballard
told you the sentence

29:11.417 --> 29:13.183
if you're convicted.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.785
Six years in jail.

29:14.787 --> 29:17.921
Six years in<i> prison,</i>
Miss McClure.

29:17.923 --> 29:21.892
May we leave now, Mr. Ballard?

29:31.270 --> 29:32.369
23 years old.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.338
She can't even imagine

29:34.340 --> 29:37.374
what six years of hard time
is like.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.510
Somebody's using her.

29:39.512 --> 29:40.844
Schwimmer?

29:40.846 --> 29:42.513
An hour ago, I didn't know,

29:42.515 --> 29:44.882
but now-- even money.

29:44.884 --> 29:47.818
Still, it usually
doesn't work this way.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.254
Usually, the criminal
doesn't<i> want</i> to go to jail.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.522
McClure does.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.190
And she'll become a martyr.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.525
She'll never give up
on Schwimmer.

29:54.527 --> 29:55.993
She won't give anybody.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.494
Except herself.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.230
It's about morality for her,
not legal compromise.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.166
So why don't we turn this
around?

30:02.168 --> 30:03.467
Let's try a reverse.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.503
I'm not part of any conspiracy,
Mr. Robinette.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.472
You understand,
Miss Schwimmer,

30:08.474 --> 30:09.840
we're going to request

30:09.842 --> 30:12.543
the maximum sentence
for Celeste McClure.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.545
You might ask your attorney
what that means.

30:14.547 --> 30:16.947
First, you have
to get a conviction

30:16.949 --> 30:18.582
with very thin evidence.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.585
Evidence we think a jury
will find convincing.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.554
Celeste McClure
<i>will</i> go to prison

30:23.556 --> 30:25.422
for a long time.

30:25.424 --> 30:29.526
MOLLOY:
People in this state
would never forget her.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.527
ROBINETTE:
Fine--

30:30.529 --> 30:32.229
make her a martyr--

30:32.231 --> 30:35.332
but Celeste McClure
is a young kid.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.936
Are you going
to let her rot behind bars?

30:38.938 --> 30:43.240
Rose, don't say anything
until we've talked.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.375
This meeting
is over.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.614
ROBINETTE:
<i> You never heard their names</i>
<i> mentioned?</i>

30:50.616 --> 30:53.917
Schwimmer or McClure?

30:53.919 --> 30:55.319
Never.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.620
Anything you remember

30:56.622 --> 30:58.622
about the day
of the bombing?

30:58.624 --> 30:59.923
Anything you've thought about

30:59.925 --> 31:03.026
since you talked with
the police?

31:03.028 --> 31:05.629
Mary said she was
taking the day off.

31:05.631 --> 31:06.630
Shopping.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.899
Patrick, her boyfriend,

31:08.901 --> 31:12.035
he came to drive her
to school.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.072
They had an argument
outside.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.640
Couples have arguments.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.342
It was serious enough, Geoffrey,

31:18.344 --> 31:20.878
for Kevin
to try to break it up.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.081
Your son here that early
in the morning a lot?

31:24.083 --> 31:26.550
GEOFFREY:
He stops by
occasionally.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.951
Not that often.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.587
ROBINETTE:
What was the argument
about?

31:30.589 --> 31:33.624
Something Patrick
had with him.

31:33.626 --> 31:34.625
Nothing.

31:34.627 --> 31:35.592
An envelope.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.627
Nothing?!

31:36.629 --> 31:39.630
So why did we
hear them yelling?

31:39.632 --> 31:42.566
Our daughter
did what she did

31:42.568 --> 31:44.968
out of her own conscience.

31:44.970 --> 31:47.104
We can live with that.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.506
<i>You</i> can live
with that, Geoffrey.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.075
A martyr will never
be able to tell me

31:52.077 --> 31:55.545
what a wonderful day she had
at school yesterday.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.981
A martyr
will never have a wedding.

31:57.983 --> 32:00.517
A martyr will never
have children.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.524
I wanted to go to Barbados.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.526
I brought her a brochure.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.396
I thought it would convince her.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.965
That's what was in the envelope.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.534
That's all it was about?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.236
Her parents...

32:19.237 --> 32:20.937
She felt it would
look bad

32:20.940 --> 32:23.607
if we went together
not married.

32:23.609 --> 32:28.478
She said I was
being insensitive
to their feelings.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.417
I had it all planned--

32:33.419 --> 32:35.152
a romantic place...

32:35.154 --> 32:36.687
It's stupid.

32:36.689 --> 32:41.525
I guess I felt I needed
the right setting.

32:41.527 --> 32:45.362
I was going
to ask her to marry... me...

32:50.035 --> 32:52.569
It wasn't that big a fight.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.338
So why did you
get involved?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.106
I went out to talk to them.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.342
Your mother
heard you yelling.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.510
Patrick said your
sister was upset.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.012
There was no fight.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.613
You're lying, Kevin.

33:03.615 --> 33:04.665
What are you gonna do?

33:04.666 --> 33:05.716
You want to charge me
with the bombing

33:05.718 --> 33:07.384
of the clinic?
You can count on it

33:07.386 --> 33:09.653
if I find you're
covering up a crime.

33:12.057 --> 33:15.525
I don't know anything
about the bombing.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.666
We'll call you
if we need you.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.737
The Donovan I.D.,
the other fingerprints--

33:26.739 --> 33:28.071
Got a match?

33:28.073 --> 33:29.473
Just came in
from Washington.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.640
He'd been
in the army.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.641
Who?

33:31.643 --> 33:35.412
The boyfriend,
Patrick Dunne.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.183
By themselves,
the fingerprints aren't proof.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.452
She could have
shown him the card

33:42.454 --> 33:44.421
without telling him

33:44.422 --> 33:46.389
she was going to use it
to plant a bomb.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.691
We need
something else.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.626
Yeah, the brother
has a story,

33:49.628 --> 33:51.228
the boyfriend another.

33:51.230 --> 33:54.631
STONE:
What about if we arrest

33:54.633 --> 33:57.501
Patrick as a co-conspirator?

33:57.503 --> 33:58.635
Based on the prints?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.570
I don't want him arraigned

34:00.572 --> 34:02.572
if you don't think
he's guilty.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.408
I don't know
if he's guilty,

34:04.410 --> 34:05.475
but let's arrest
him anyway.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.510
Not arraign him
till tomorrow,

34:06.512 --> 34:07.677
put him in a room
with Kevin...

34:07.679 --> 34:08.712
We'll see what
shakes loose.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.247
Yeah.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.449
The charge
is arson and conspiracy.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.418
I'm not involved
in that bombing.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.753
You can call your lawyer
in a few minutes.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.658
Easy.
This is unbelievable.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.126
What's he
doing here?

34:23.128 --> 34:24.795
Is he
being arrested too?

34:24.797 --> 34:25.796
Arrested?

34:25.798 --> 34:27.664
Mary's false I.D. card,
Kevin.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.867
Patrick's fingerprints
are on it.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.069
Did you get it for her
so she could do the bombing?

34:32.071 --> 34:33.737
It makes you a
co-conspirator,
Patrick.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.674
I'm not going to jail, Kevin.
I can prove

34:37.676 --> 34:38.642
I wasn't involved...
Don't tell them
anything.

34:38.644 --> 34:39.643
Mary wasn't...

34:39.645 --> 34:41.578
Shut up! Shut up!

34:50.489 --> 34:51.822
All he wants
is for her to be a martyr

34:51.824 --> 34:53.690
instead of a sinner.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.693
She didn't go there
to bomb the clinic.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.863
She was pregnant.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.832
She was there

35:01.834 --> 35:03.767
to have an abortion.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.770
She was there to kill our baby.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.476
She was ashamed.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.511
She thought if her parents
found out, they would...

35:14.513 --> 35:15.879
But you wanted
to marry her.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.214
That would've
solved everything.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.415
Doesn't matter.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.784
The baby comes early,
everybody knows.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.387
So under a false name,
she'd have an abortion?

35:24.389 --> 35:27.524
That morning,
I gave her the I.D.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.393
and the money,
so that she could...

35:30.395 --> 35:35.398
I pleaded with her
to at least let me take her.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.467
I pleaded.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.806
With arson,
you could be a martyr;

35:42.808 --> 35:45.542
with conspiracy,
you could still be a martyr.

35:45.544 --> 35:49.279
But, Miss McClure, now...
now we are talking about murder.

35:49.281 --> 35:53.416
I didn't kill anybody.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.752
Mary Donovan
did not get hit by a car.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.754
Tell her, Mr. Ballard.

36:00.192 --> 36:04.161
It's not six years
in jail anymore, Miss McClure.

36:04.163 --> 36:06.429
BALLARD:
You'll never get her
for manslaughter.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.430
Manslaughter?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.498
We are now talking

36:08.500 --> 36:10.300
about murder
in the second-degree--

36:10.302 --> 36:11.535
depraved indifference
to human life.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.037
You're out of your mind.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.538
STONE:
15 years to life
behind bars.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.307
Now, I don't want
to put you in prison,
Miss McClure,

36:17.309 --> 36:19.309
but somebody killed
Mary Donovan.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.312
An innocent woman died--
that is murder.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.881
That makes you no better
than the people you oppose.

36:24.883 --> 36:28.385
Counselor, she's a kid--
you said so yourself.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.557
Mary Donovan was a kid too.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.525
Ask her parents.

36:39.831 --> 36:43.833
All right, she pleads
on all three counts outstanding,

36:43.835 --> 36:46.203
you recommend minimum sentences,

36:46.205 --> 36:48.505
she testifies against nobody.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.507
If this was Schwimmer's idea,
she testifies against her.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.510
We drop down to conspiracy six,
arson four.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.479
She pleads to criminally
negligent homicide,

36:56.481 --> 36:58.315
she does six months.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.451
Celeste, do you understand?

37:04.456 --> 37:07.324
If I thought
anyone would get hurt,

37:07.326 --> 37:11.328
I wouldn't have given Rose
the bomb.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.930
The charges here are conspiracy
in the second degree,

37:13.932 --> 37:17.234
arson in the second degree,
murder in the second degree.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.869
Does the defendant
wish to enter a plea?

37:19.871 --> 37:21.538
Not guilty, Your Honor.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.473
If it pleases the court,
we're requesting bail.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.025
JUDGE:
Mr. Stone?

37:25.026 --> 37:26.576
Your Honor, Miss Schwimmer
has been convicted

37:26.578 --> 37:29.913
of several misdemeanors and has
made every court appearance.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.481
However,
in our experience,

37:31.483 --> 37:32.983
activists accused
of more serious crimes

37:32.985 --> 37:35.986
have sometimes decided
to work for their cause

37:35.988 --> 37:38.622
from behind the scenes--
far behind.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.523
Therefore,
The People recommend

37:40.525 --> 37:42.392
the defendant
be held without bail.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.960
Your Honor,
there's no reason to believe

37:43.962 --> 37:45.829
the defendant is
a flight risk.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.398
Mr. Stone, I'm inclined to agree
with Mr. Molloy.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.633
What applies generally,

37:49.635 --> 37:52.269
may not apply specifically
to this defendant.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.503
I understand,
Your Honor.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.539
But this is a homicide,
Mr. Molloy,

37:56.541 --> 37:59.542
with two additional
felony charges.

37:59.544 --> 38:02.979
Bail is set at...
$300,000.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.381
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )

38:06.351 --> 38:08.285
STONE:
<i> And regardless</i>
<i> of your personal feelings,</i>

38:08.287 --> 38:11.655
you are not being asked
to decide a moral issue,

38:11.657 --> 38:13.657
you are being asked
to decide a legal issue.

38:13.659 --> 38:16.493
The crime is the murder
of a young woman

38:16.495 --> 38:18.028
by an exploding bomb

38:18.030 --> 38:19.296
and that woman--

38:19.298 --> 38:21.398
Miss Rose Schwimmer--

38:21.400 --> 38:23.667
is accused of placing a bomb

38:23.669 --> 38:26.469
with depraved indifference
to human life--

38:26.471 --> 38:28.938
indifference to anyone
it might hurt.

38:28.940 --> 38:32.942
Now, you may hear arguments
that the ends justify the means,

38:32.944 --> 38:34.878
that an illegal act

38:34.880 --> 38:36.980
is somehow justified
by a moral cause.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.984
If you are even tempted
to agree with that argument,

38:40.986 --> 38:42.319
please remember:

38:42.321 --> 38:44.954
killing is not only
against the law,

38:44.956 --> 38:47.657
it is also immoral

38:47.659 --> 38:49.926
and if anyone suggests to you

38:49.928 --> 38:52.929
that morality and law
are somehow in conflict,

38:52.931 --> 38:54.931
I ask you to remember that.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.701
STONE:
Is fertilizer and diesel fuel

38:57.703 --> 38:59.703
a commonly known
explosive?

38:59.705 --> 39:01.971
They blow mountains apart
with it.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.941
Did you find
actual pieces of the bomb?

39:04.943 --> 39:06.943
That's correct--
fragments of it were coated

39:06.945 --> 39:08.912
with the fertilizer compound.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.747
Did you make a comparison
between that compound

39:10.749 --> 39:14.050
and the fertilizer taken
from the community garden?

39:14.052 --> 39:15.051
I did.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.619
What were
the results?

39:16.621 --> 39:18.421
They were
hemically identical.

39:18.423 --> 39:19.489
Thank you.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.491
No further questions,
Your Honor.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.693
Mr. Olivera, is the chemical
in the fertilizer in question

39:23.695 --> 39:25.628
available as a chemical

39:25.630 --> 39:28.565
other than
in that particular fertilizer?

39:28.567 --> 39:29.933
Yes.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.936
Other manufacturers
make the same formulation.

39:32.938 --> 39:35.505
And is it also available
just as a chemical compound

39:35.507 --> 39:37.640
that has nothing to do
with fertilizer?

39:37.642 --> 39:38.775
Yes.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.378
So the nitrate
in the bomb

39:41.380 --> 39:43.680
could've come from
somewhere else,
isn't that right?

39:43.682 --> 39:46.516
It's remotely possible--
one in a million.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.486
Thank you.
No more questions.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.654
REPORTER:
Demanding police protection
for abortion clinics,

39:51.656 --> 39:54.124
an estimated
10,000 pro-choice demonstrators

39:54.126 --> 39:55.725
marched down Tenth Avenue.

39:57.462 --> 40:00.764
It's only going
to get worse.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.700
Luckily, that ain't
my problem.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.769
STONE:
We're willing
to consider a plea--

40:05.771 --> 40:07.170
manslaughter two.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.973
Mary Donovan
was the perfect martyr.

40:09.975 --> 40:13.443
You should've
left it that way.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.979
And you, hiding behind
a dead woman?

40:15.981 --> 40:18.615
I don't think the jury
will like that.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.618
Mary Donovan was ready
to kill her baby.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.154
Will the jury
like that any better?

40:24.156 --> 40:26.723
Mary Donovan is not
on trial here.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.658
She will be.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.994
She conspired to commit murder.

40:30.996 --> 40:36.166
Are you admitting
that Mary didn't plant the bomb?

40:40.439 --> 40:41.704
In this state,

40:41.706 --> 40:43.807
capital punishment
is against the law.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.809
Yet you're ready to risk

40:45.811 --> 40:48.445
your own form
of capital punishment

40:48.447 --> 40:51.448
against people you consider
deserving of it?

40:51.450 --> 40:53.783
They do deserve it.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.586
This isn't getting us anywhere.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.121
Come on, Rose.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.727
Miss Schwimmer?

41:06.498 --> 41:09.466
I think you should reconsider.

41:09.468 --> 41:12.769
I don't make deals
with the devil.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.177
STONE:
<i> Two-and-a-half months ago,</i>

41:21.179 --> 41:23.146
did Miss McClure come
into your store

41:23.148 --> 41:25.048
and place her usual order?

41:25.050 --> 41:26.716
Yes, she did.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.751
Did she add
anything unusual to it?

41:28.753 --> 41:30.620
Objection--
characterization.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.155
Sustained.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.123
Did Miss McClure's purchases

41:34.125 --> 41:36.593
include anything
she did not make

41:36.595 --> 41:38.061
on a regular basis?

41:38.063 --> 41:40.864
Yes, a 50-pound bag
of fertilizer

41:40.866 --> 41:43.867
with a special nitrate formula.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.668
Did that strike you
as strange?

41:45.670 --> 41:48.771
It's used mostly for palm trees.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.641
I told her it would
kill her plants.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.610
I had to special-order it.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.179
On that day, when Miss McClure
ordered the fertilizer,

41:56.181 --> 41:57.847
was anyone with her?

41:57.849 --> 41:58.915
Yes.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.751
Is that person
in this courtroom?

42:01.753 --> 42:02.819
Yes.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.088
Would you point that person out

42:05.090 --> 42:06.189
for the jury?

42:06.191 --> 42:08.858
She's sitting right over there.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.127
Your Honor, may
the record show

42:11.129 --> 42:13.696
that she's pointing
to the defendant?

42:13.698 --> 42:15.698
JUDGE:
Let the record
so indicate.

42:15.700 --> 42:22.772
Rose said... talking, marching--

42:22.774 --> 42:26.843
it wasn't stopping
the abortions.

42:26.845 --> 42:28.678
She was right.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.648
Every day, more babies
were being murdered.

42:31.650 --> 42:34.183
Did Miss Schwimmer
talk about the bombings

42:34.185 --> 42:37.120
in front of the other members
of Women for Life?

42:37.122 --> 42:40.857
She said
they wouldn't understand.

42:40.859 --> 42:44.928
And...

42:44.930 --> 42:48.898
that if it was
just the two of us,

42:48.900 --> 42:51.334
nobody would find out.

42:51.336 --> 42:53.836
When did you give
Miss Schwimmer the bomb?

42:53.838 --> 42:58.875
I met her
for brunch that morning...

42:58.877 --> 43:01.878
at Lazy Jane's
on Seventh Avenue.

43:01.880 --> 43:05.782
STONE:
And tell the jury
what happened then.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.216
Miss McClure?

43:10.221 --> 43:15.224
Rose said she would go out
the back door.

43:15.226 --> 43:16.993
It's next to the ladies' room.

43:19.164 --> 43:22.899
She said she could
get down the alley

43:22.901 --> 43:25.969
and back within ten minutes.

43:25.971 --> 43:28.972
She told me
to wait for five minutes

43:28.974 --> 43:31.975
and then call the clinic
and warn them.

43:31.977 --> 43:33.943
Did you make
the call?

43:33.945 --> 43:34.944
Yes.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.946
Your Honor,
I would like

43:36.947 --> 43:38.947
to enter into evidence
telephone company records

43:38.950 --> 43:40.950
showing calls made
from the pay phone

43:40.952 --> 43:42.185
of the Lazy Jane restaurant

43:42.187 --> 43:45.188
on the day
of the bombing.

43:45.190 --> 43:48.024
And no further questions,
Your Honor.

43:53.999 --> 43:56.899
Is defense ready
for its summation?

43:56.901 --> 44:00.870
Your Honor, at this time,
against advice of counsel,

44:00.872 --> 44:04.307
the defendant wishes to testify
in her own behalf.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.309
JUDGE:
Miss Schwimmer,
you realize

44:06.311 --> 44:09.012
you will be subject
to cross-examination?

44:09.014 --> 44:10.980
I do, Your Honor.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.982
I urge you
to reconsider.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.685
Listen to advice of counsel.

44:15.687 --> 44:19.288
However, I won't prevent you
from testifying.

44:34.072 --> 44:38.307
Do you swear to tell the truth,
so help you God?

44:38.309 --> 44:39.976
I certainly do.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
BALLARD:
Miss Schwimmer,

44:44.282 --> 44:46.949
did you conspire
with Celeste McClure

44:46.951 --> 44:49.852
to bomb the Chelsea
Women's Choice Center,

44:49.854 --> 44:52.722
as well as seven other
abortion clinics?

44:52.724 --> 44:54.390
Yes, I did.

44:56.695 --> 44:59.829
Then you're guilty of the
charges leveled against you?

44:59.831 --> 45:02.331
Not before God.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.767
Can you explain why you're
innocent before God?

45:04.769 --> 45:06.302
Objection--
this case is being judged

45:06.304 --> 45:08.004
on the temporal plane,
Your Honor.

45:08.006 --> 45:09.272
Sustained.

45:09.274 --> 45:11.741
How dare you object, Mr. Stone.

45:11.743 --> 45:13.042
We've done our homework.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.978
You were baptized,
you go to communion

45:15.980 --> 45:18.414
and you prosecute me?
JUDGE:
That's enough.

45:18.416 --> 45:20.883
All the abortions in that clinic
are murder and you know it.

45:20.885 --> 45:21.951
Your Honor?

45:21.953 --> 45:23.052
Miss Schwimmer!

45:23.054 --> 45:25.121
Mary Donovan's death was tragic

45:25.123 --> 45:27.423
but if it prevents one abortion

45:27.425 --> 45:29.726
the scales are balanced.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.394
Abortion must end.

45:31.396 --> 45:33.096
Miss Schwimmer,
that will be all!

45:33.098 --> 45:34.464
Are we a nation

45:34.466 --> 45:35.998
who can
tolerate the abortionist

45:36.000 --> 45:37.900
sticking his hand
in a mother's womb

45:37.902 --> 45:39.435
(<i> gavel banging</i> )
and strangling God's creation?

45:39.437 --> 45:41.938
The court officer
will remove Miss Schwimmer!

45:41.940 --> 45:43.740
Your Honor,
I have only one question

45:43.742 --> 45:44.941
to ask of the defendant.

45:44.943 --> 45:46.075
SCHWIMMER:
Which is?

45:47.112 --> 45:49.011
If abortion is murder,

45:49.013 --> 45:51.080
no matter how you feel
about Mary Donovan,

45:51.082 --> 45:53.449
aren't you guilty of the
murder of her unborn child?

46:10.869 --> 46:13.770
On the first count
in the indictment,

46:13.772 --> 46:16.038
the charge of conspiracy
in the second degree,

46:16.040 --> 46:17.440
how do you find?

46:17.442 --> 46:20.076
We find the defendant guilty.

46:20.078 --> 46:23.179
JUDGE:
And the second count--

46:23.181 --> 46:26.015
the charge
of arson in the second degree,

46:26.017 --> 46:27.416
how do you find?

46:27.418 --> 46:30.019
We find the defendant guilty.

46:30.021 --> 46:33.422
JUDGE:
Third count-- murder
in the second degree,

46:33.424 --> 46:35.458
how do you find?

46:35.460 --> 46:37.994
We find the defendant
guilty.

46:43.935 --> 46:45.835
STONE:
What do we say to people

46:45.837 --> 46:47.370
who know she committed
a criminal act

46:47.372 --> 46:48.938
but don't think
she's a criminal?

46:48.940 --> 46:50.573
ROBINETTE:
That's easy:

46:50.574 --> 46:52.207
A criminal<i> is</i> someone
who commits a criminal act--

46:52.210 --> 46:53.910
for any reason.

46:53.912 --> 46:55.111
But up until<i> Roe v. Wade,</i>

46:55.113 --> 46:56.479
the abortionists
were the criminals.

46:56.481 --> 46:57.814
And if the law
hadn't changed,

46:57.816 --> 46:59.115
there never would've
been a bombing.

46:59.117 --> 47:01.117
If the law hadn't changed,
I'd be a slave.

47:01.119 --> 47:01.150
You can't turn back the clock.
