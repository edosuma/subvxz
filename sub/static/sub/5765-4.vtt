WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.392
Previously on The Good Wife...

00:03.430 --> 00:05.569
An hour ago I resigned
as state's attorney

00:05.600 --> 00:07.363
of Cook County.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.765
I want to be clear.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.734
I have never abused my office.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.169
Alicia,

00:12.210 --> 00:14.405
I know this has been
hard on you,

00:14.440 --> 00:16.078
but you have to believe me--
I'm innocent.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.702
JACKIE:
He needs you

00:17.750 --> 00:19.445
to forgive him, Alicia.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.744
Jackie, he took everything
I thought we had

00:21.780 --> 00:24.442
and he just put it
out there for everyone.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.458
He didn't want that.
The press...

00:26.490 --> 00:28.219
Oh, Jackie,
stop it.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.683
Peter wasn't thinking of us.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.557
Kalinda Sharma.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.091
I'm the in-house.
Oh, the investigator.

00:37.130 --> 00:38.825
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.088
Ryan thinks there's
a good chance

00:41.140 --> 00:42.835
the appellate court's going
to listen to my case.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.464
If they overturn it,
everything goes back to normal.

00:45.510 --> 00:48.638
Peter, it's never
going back to normal.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.081
GOLDEN:
This was after you dropped
your kids off at school?

00:58.120 --> 01:00.315
ALICIA:
Yes.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.079
GOLDEN: This was
on the 16th?

01:05.130 --> 01:07.121
Yes.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.863
And who first told you of
your husband's infidelity,

01:10.900 --> 01:13.698
Mrs. Florrick?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.469
CNBC.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.865
(laughs)

01:16.910 --> 01:18.502
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.304
I was at the cleaners.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.874
I was waiting in line.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.708
CNBC was playing on the TV.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.709
I saw it on the crawl
at the bottom of the screen.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.786
And, just so we're clear,

01:32.820 --> 01:35.482
you never once suspected
your husband's infidelity

01:35.520 --> 01:37.329
before that moment, is that
correct, Mrs. Florrick?

01:38.360 --> 01:40.521
That's correct.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.290
I'm-I'm sorry to ask these
personal questions,

01:43.330 --> 01:44.797
but I'm really
on your side,

01:44.830 --> 01:47.139
and as your
husband's attorney,

01:47.170 --> 01:49.161
our appeal depends on proving
that your husband made

01:49.210 --> 01:50.359
untruthful
statements at work,

01:50.410 --> 01:52.298
not because he was
tryIng to cover up

01:52.340 --> 01:54.774
illegal acts as a
state's attorney,

01:54.810 --> 01:58.143
but that he was trying
to hide an affair

01:58.180 --> 02:00.648
from his wife.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.386
You understand?

02:02.420 --> 02:04.479
I understand.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.181
Good.

02:06.220 --> 02:07.812
Uh...

02:07.860 --> 02:10.158
let's turn _to
the call girl.

02:10.190 --> 02:11.384
She made some statements
In the press.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.227
(phone rings)

02:14.400 --> 02:17.164
Alicia Florrick.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.498
VVhen?

02:19.540 --> 02:22.737
Are you sure
you need me now?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.735
Um... I'll call your office
to arrange

02:28.780 --> 02:31.248
to do this
another time?

02:31.280 --> 02:35.273
I just want to let you know
that Peter has a lot of friends.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.618
Judges, lavwers,
business folk

02:37.650 --> 02:40.210
who didn't like the way
that this went down.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.056
They want to help.

02:41.090 --> 02:44.355
I'm just saying
if you need anything,

02:44.390 --> 02:46.699
day or night,

02:46.730 --> 02:49.563
give me a call?

02:51.600 --> 02:54.194
We're fine.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.662
Ah, one more thing.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.406
Um...

02:57.440 --> 02:58.429
we're looking
for correspondence

02:58.470 --> 02:59.801
that may have taken place

02:59.840 --> 03:02.400
between Peter
and a Gerald Kozko.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.778
Just like the store,
only with a "K" and a "Z."

03:06.820 --> 03:07.969
The real estate
developer.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.511
Peter says all
of his private correspondences

03:10.550 --> 03:12.484
are at your apartment.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.249
It would help a lot

03:14.290 --> 03:18.283
if you could look for a letter
or a card from him.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.399
That's it.

03:19.430 --> 03:23.969
Dentist visit... is over.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.899
Alicia.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.975
I heard you were coming
on board to replace Bree.

03:39.010 --> 03:39.942
Could you...?
Sure.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.811
Ah, talk about
complicated.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.317
Jury selection
took a week.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.385
We got five more of these

03:44.420 --> 03:46.012
filled with medical testimony
and the depo dump.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.449
Did you read that?

03:47.490 --> 03:49.549
I was on Will's felony case
till 30 minutes ago.

03:49.590 --> 03:50.852
Yeah, I was on
a slip-and-fall

03:50.890 --> 03:52.289
until Diane yanked
me on this.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.729
It's just "all hands
on deck," you know?

03:53.760 --> 03:54.988
But this one's
pretty cool,

03:55.030 --> 03:58.329
so come on, I'll get
you up to speed.

03:58.370 --> 04:01.294
DIANE:
And what is an
Ironman, Ray?

04:01.340 --> 04:04.366
_RAY:_ _
Running, biking,
ocean swimming.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.776
You swim 2.4 miles,

04:06.810 --> 04:08.937
bike 112 miles,

04:08.980 --> 04:10.447
and then run a
full marathon.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.311
And you placed third
in the Hawaiian Ironman,

04:12.350 --> 04:14.045
is that correct?

04:14.080 --> 04:16.310
RAY:
Yes, I did, yeah.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.988
DIANE:
So tell me what
happened on the 12th,

04:18.020 --> 04:19.317
Ray.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.554
RAY:
Well, it was right after

04:20.590 --> 04:22.319
the Ironman.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.578
We were back
at the hotel,

04:24.630 --> 04:25.927
_ _ and I felt _
this migraine coming on,

04:25.960 --> 04:28.053
so I took these...

04:28.100 --> 04:30.694
pills my doctor
prescribed me

04:30.730 --> 04:33.039
and the migraine
just...

04:34.040 --> 04:34.995
...seemed to be getting worse.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.928
Ray Demory.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.460
He's our test case.

04:38.510 --> 04:39.772
If Diane wins
this one,

04:39.810 --> 04:41.732
there's a_ massive class
action in the Wings.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.998
RAY:
...I felt unsteady.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.610
The next day at the hospital,
I found out I had a stroke.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.971
And these pills you took--
they were Zennapril, correct?

04:49.020 --> 04:50.112
Your Honor...

04:50.150 --> 04:53.688
The drug manufactured by these
three gentlemen over here.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.381
There's nothing I enjoy
more than watching

04:55.420 --> 04:56.819
Miss Lockhart perform

04:56.860 --> 04:58.020
her courtroom magic...

04:58.060 --> 05:00.699
James McCloon-- killer
defense counsel.

05:00.730 --> 05:02.322
They call him
the Velvet Shiv.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.860
McCLOON:
...my clients
manufactured

05:03.900 --> 05:04.969
Zennaan

05:05.000 --> 05:06.536
and stop poking
at them like perps

05:06.570 --> 05:07.867
on America's Most Wanted.
Funny,

05:07.900 --> 05:08.889
I didn't hear an objection,
Your Honor.

05:08.940 --> 05:11.568
Let's just please refrain
from the crosstalk.

05:11.610 --> 05:12.634
Yes, Your Honor.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.978
I will try not to interrupt
Miss Lockhart again.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.375
It will be difficult,

05:16.410 --> 05:17.547
but I will try.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.912
So, Ray,

05:19.950 --> 05:22.544
how would you describe
your physical condition now?

05:22.590 --> 05:23.682
(chuckles)

05:23.720 --> 05:26.416
You're looking at it.

05:27.490 --> 05:30.459
Mostly it's been
hard on Carol.

05:31.590 --> 05:36.095
We got married a year ago,
before my stroke, and she...

05:36.130 --> 05:38.564
she didn't buy
into this.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.136
I mean...

05:40.170 --> 05:44.129
one day her husband's an Ironman
and the next day he's a...

05:44.170 --> 05:45.535
(sighs)

05:45.570 --> 05:47.572
...an invalid.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.673
Brandon, Lahna, you take point
on legal precedent.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.109
Cary, you take Alicia
and review anything

05:53.150 --> 05:54.139
that could undercut
the class action.

05:54.180 --> 05:57.047
I don't want
to win the battle
and lose the war.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.114
Use Kalinda
if you need to, okay?

05:58.150 --> 06:00.459
Let's get to it.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.434
Mrs. Demory.

06:13.470 --> 06:14.437
Hmm?

06:14.470 --> 06:15.892
Can I get you
something?

06:15.940 --> 06:18.932
No, I'm fine.

06:18.970 --> 06:21.973
Sorry, must have had
a zombie look on my face.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.079
No, no, no.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.908
We all need a moment.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.440
I'm Alicia.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.608
Right, you replaced Bree.

06:31.650 --> 06:34.153
Nice to meet you.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.787
Oh, this.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.821
This is what keeps us going.

06:39.860 --> 06:42.465
Michael Graff.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.469
He took Zennapril
after a Little League game.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.889
Jenny Hollis.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.807
She was a dancer.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.831
They all wrote you?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.006
Yes.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.770
138 of them.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.778
I...

06:58.810 --> 07:00.016
Sorry.

07:01.050 --> 07:03.189
Just...

07:03.220 --> 07:05.518
They're all counting
on us, you know?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.213
If we don't win,
they're stuck.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.718
It's just a lot
of responsibility, you know?

07:16.530 --> 07:18.464
Objection.
Relevance.
Isn't it the case,

07:18.500 --> 07:20.161
Mr. Demory, the only reason
you're not suing your doctor is

07:20.200 --> 07:22.998
because his pockets aren't
as deep as my client's?

07:23.040 --> 07:23.938
Objection!
Your Honor!

07:23.970 --> 07:24.902
Can we have a ruling?
Please, Your Honor.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.932
Approach the bench.
Get me all references

07:27.980 --> 07:30.107
to secondary prescriptions
in Ray's deposition.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.469
Right.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.668
ALICIA:
Kalinda, I need you
to look into this.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.691
So, what are you saying?
Someone's bribing a juror?

08:27.740 --> 08:28.695
I'm not saying
anything.

08:28.740 --> 08:31.163
I just found it.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.132
Look, this could
be anything.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.705
A seating chart
for a garden party,

08:35.740 --> 08:36.707
a football lineup.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.002
With 12 linemen?

08:42.280 --> 08:44.885
What's that?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.887
ALICIA:
Yep.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.626
We should talk
to the hostess,

09:23.660 --> 09:25.287
see if anyone from the court
eats here regularly.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.355
No, we should take a deep
breath, show this to Diane...

09:27.400 --> 09:28.992
Shh!

09:29.030 --> 09:31.066
MAN: ...only spot in
Chicago not stuffed
full of yuppies.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.294
Been coming here
three times a week...

09:32.330 --> 09:35.595
I don't think we need
to talk to the hostess.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.459
I come here
so often,

09:36.500 --> 09:38.832
I asked them to name
a sandwich after me.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.701
Waitress looked me dead
in the eye and said,

09:40.740 --> 09:42.173
"We don't serve ham."

09:42.210 --> 09:45.145
(laughter)

09:49.280 --> 09:51.145
(no audio)

09:52.760 --> 09:56.753
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

10:08.100 --> 10:09.863
ALICIA:
It could be anything.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.400
It could be
just a doodle.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.702
We don't know.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.799
And you found it
in our depositions?

10:14.840 --> 10:17.070
Yes, but it could have been
on the floor and stuck to one.

10:17.110 --> 10:20.170
We just thought it should be
brought to your attention.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.778
Remember last year?
Yep.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.640
DIANE: Was McCloon
ever cleared of that?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.112
_ WILL: _
It's still up for reVIew.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.287
So you think
we should-- what?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.878
Don't go to
the judge.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.683
It makes no sense.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.879
How does it end
up in our depos?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.022
McCloon sticks it in there.

10:32.060 --> 10:33.049
He wants a mistrial,

10:33.100 --> 10:35.193
but he wants us to go
to the judge and request it.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.925
Or he's just screwing
with your head.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.431
There's_ another
p055ibility.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.802
There's a young associate
on his team-- a redhead.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.762
She came over and introduced
herself this morning.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.074
Said she worked as a paralegal
here last summer.

10:47.110 --> 10:49.806
So, what, McCloon has
a whistle-blower in his midst?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.717
Young, idealistic junior
associate sees something wrong,

10:52.750 --> 10:55.014
feels bad about it,
slips us a warning in our depos.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.119
I could see that.

10:57.150 --> 11:00.085
Okay, this is what we do.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.055
We do our homework
and look into juror number two.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.421
And juror number 11.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.087
Mm-hmm.
Or juror number 11.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.950
We go to the judge
if we have anything.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.194
You don't want a mistrial,
right?

11:09.230 --> 11:10.822
No.
Ray was good on the stand.

11:10.870 --> 11:11.859
Thejury liked him.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.936
And McCloon's defense seems
to be a variation

11:13.970 --> 11:15.790
on holding his breath
and threatening to turn blue.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.468
This trial is sounding
more and more fun.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.899
Let's see if you got
a bad juror on your hands.

11:20.940 --> 11:22.771
Put in for an alternate.
Okay. I'll put

11:22.810 --> 11:23.970
Kalinda and Cary on it.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.272
Excuse me...

11:25.310 --> 11:27.244
but I'd like to do this.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.014
Okay.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.849
Juror number two
is Marilyn Wolk,

11:35.890 --> 11:37.426
a hairdresser
from South Bridgeport.

11:37.460 --> 11:41.055
We scored her an 85 positive
on our bias scale,

11:41.100 --> 11:42.965
one of the highest scores
we've ever given,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.888
s_o we_believe
she's firmly in your camp.

11:44.930 --> 11:48.491
Now, I know that you pay me
only to help select jurors,

11:48.540 --> 11:50.428
but ifI knew
what you were after,

11:50.470 --> 11:52.461
I could offer
further consultation.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.978
No.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.204
This is good.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.969
Keep going.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.379
Uh, juror number 11
is Calvin Tober.

12:02.420 --> 12:05.218
He's a grad student
in comparative history.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.980
We scored him only
a 62% positive

12:08.020 --> 12:09.419
on our bias scale--

12:09.460 --> 12:11.348
well within the range
of acceptability,

12:11.390 --> 12:12.482
but we like him.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.851
Being African-American,
he's more prone

12:14.900 --> 12:16.891
to mistrust authority.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.921
He's intelligent, but not
to the point of overcoming bias.

12:18.970 --> 12:21.359
Not like Asians
or MeXIcans.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.498
We talk in racial stereotypes
because you pay us to,

12:26.540 --> 12:28.770
and we find
racial profiling works.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.038
But if I'm
not needed...

12:30.080 --> 12:31.502
You're not needed.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.173
Thank you.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.188
You've got issues?

12:46.230 --> 12:49.427
Paying her $100,000
for three months

12:49.460 --> 12:51.963
of high school-level
psychology--

12:52.000 --> 12:54.366
yeah, I guess I do have issues.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.265
Okay.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.961
So, what are we thinking?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.534
(sighs)

13:05.310 --> 13:07.278
Wolk worked as a rent-a-chair
hair stylist, right?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.947
Which means she
only gets paid

13:08.980 --> 13:10.447
when she actually
has a customer.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.185
She could have claimed
financial hardship

13:12.220 --> 13:14.256
and ducked jury duty.

13:14.290 --> 13:15.985
So why didn't she?

13:16.020 --> 13:17.829
Civic duty?

13:17.860 --> 13:19.896
Jury tampering pays better.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.124
Okay.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.094
But let's look into both.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.791
Okay.

13:26.630 --> 13:27.995
Hi. I hate to trouble you,

13:28.040 --> 13:29.962
but I'm from
the next building over

13:30.010 --> 13:32.535
and the delivery man left this
at my door by mistake.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.073
Is there a Mr. Tober
in the building?

13:36.910 --> 13:37.899
Hi.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.269
I'm sorry to bother you.

13:39.310 --> 13:42.108
My name's Kalinda,
and my husband and I

13:42.150 --> 13:44.118
were thinking of buying a home
in the area.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.447
I can always come back later,

13:45.490 --> 13:47.117
if you know what time
he gets home.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.354
We're interested
in the preschool

13:48.390 --> 13:49.482
around the corner and...

13:49.520 --> 13:51.249
...or anyone else in his family.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.155
I just wanted to get a sense
of the neighborhood.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.122
Tober, I think his name is.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.128
Usually, I don't like
black people much,

13:57.170 --> 13:58.489
but he seems nice.

14:00.070 --> 14:01.162
They're the Wolks.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.599
She's a hairdresser.

14:02.640 --> 14:06.030
And he's... actually,
I think he's out of work.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.277
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.
Mmm.

14:08.310 --> 14:10.301
Hard times, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.079
But their house
is so lovely.

14:12.110 --> 14:13.919
Looks like they put
a lot into it.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.269
Storm windows
in front

14:15.320 --> 14:16.469
and air-conditioning...

14:16.520 --> 14:17.885
They bought a car, too.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.582
Guess they came
into some money.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.053
Hey, there he is now.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.351
That's the
husband-- Derek.

14:25.390 --> 14:26.357
(car alarm chirps)

14:26.390 --> 14:28.119
Oh, gosh!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.593
I'm sorry.

14:29.630 --> 14:32.019
I forgot-- I have
to meet the Realtor.
Oh!

14:32.070 --> 14:33.890
Thanks so much for your time.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.472
DIANE:
Objection, Your Honor.

14:43.510 --> 14:44.977
Is this
really necessary?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.648
McCLOON:
The Demorys are
seeking damages

14:49.020 --> 14:50.419
The jury needs
to understand that loss.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.179
Counsel...
DIANE:
Sir, the term,
"consortium,"

14:52.220 --> 14:54.415
is not limited...
McCLOON:
I know what the term

14:54.460 --> 14:56.109
consortium means.
Counselors, please.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.253
I have prided myself
in not using my gavel once

14:58.290 --> 15:00.121
in my 30 years on the bench...

15:00.160 --> 15:02.549
What's going on?
...but you are truly
making me reconsider.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.965
What?
Now, Miss Lockhart,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.321
I just... overruled.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.167
Ka-ching.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.134
CARY:
I heard you were on

15:10.170 --> 15:12.138
some hush-hush project.
What is it?

15:12.170 --> 15:14.001
It's hush-hush.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.928
McCLOON:
Mrs. Demory,

15:15.980 --> 15:17.470
before your husband's stroke,

15:17.510 --> 15:19.705
how often did you
have sexual relations?

15:19.750 --> 15:21.115
I don't know-- I guess...

15:21.150 --> 15:22.947
twice a week.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.184
McCLOON:
And since the stroke,

15:24.220 --> 15:26.108
how often do
you have sex?

15:27.620 --> 15:28.951
CAROL:
I don't know.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.548
McCLOON:
Would you say
it was less?

15:30.590 --> 15:31.579
Yes.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.619
Less.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.797
But your husband

15:33.830 --> 15:36.628
isn't completely paralyzed
from the waist down, is he?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.031
CAROL:
No.

15:45.470 --> 15:46.459
No, I'm fine.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.431
I'm just...

15:47.480 --> 15:50.199
angry at myself for
letting him get to me.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.275
Well, it's hard when they
treat your private life

15:52.310 --> 15:53.675
like a crime scene.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.618
Yeah.

15:54.650 --> 15:57.517
But I guess there are...
greater tragedies.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.180
(phone ringing)

16:05.290 --> 16:06.154
Alicia Florrick.

16:06.190 --> 16:07.327
Ah. Alicia.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.759
I'm glad I got you.
It's Daniel.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.755
VVho?

16:09.800 --> 16:10.994
Peter's lawyer.

16:11.030 --> 16:11.997
Oh, hi.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.065
Do you have a minute?

16:13.100 --> 16:14.192
Actually, I'm a bit busy.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.059
I was just wondering if you had

16:15.100 --> 16:16.032
a chance to look
for the Kozko letters.

16:16.070 --> 16:19.107
We're struggling
with these weekend meetings

16:19.140 --> 16:21.131
that he had with Peter,

16:21.180 --> 16:22.579
um, last March.

16:22.610 --> 16:25.204
Uh, the ninth, the 16th
and the 25th.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.615
I haven't looked yet.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.117
Anything that will show

16:29.150 --> 16:32.119
that Peter did not know,
going into those meetings,

16:32.150 --> 16:34.687
there was something untoward
will help us.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.325
DANIEL:
Oh, uh...

16:39.360 --> 16:41.248
Alicia, um...

16:41.300 --> 16:44.019
I was chatting with
the headmaster at Briarcrest

16:44.070 --> 16:45.492
on another matter,
and he mentioned

16:45.530 --> 16:47.566
that they have scholarships
for your kids.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.238
Mr. Golden.

16:49.270 --> 16:50.567
Yes?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.635
Don't. Please.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.500
Yes.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.269
I'm sorry.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.662
(indistinct conversation)

17:28.510 --> 17:29.807
(sighs)

17:41.320 --> 17:43.857
KALINDA (over phone):
$35,000 can buy you
a lot of stuff.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.585
ALICIA:
That's a bit tenuous, isn't it?

17:45.630 --> 17:48.155
Her husband works
at McCloon's firm?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.724
Look, I'm not saying
it's a smoking gun.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.297
I'm just saying that she
didn't put it on her voir dire,

17:52.330 --> 17:54.662
so if we wanted to get rid
of her, we can.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.629
I say we bring it to Diane
and see what she says, okay?

17:59.670 --> 18:01.399
Thanks. Bye.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.490
GRACE: Zach, give me
back the remote!

18:27.540 --> 18:29.690
ZACH: We've already
seen this one.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.798
PETER (on video):
Shh. Not so loud.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.400
(girl giggling)

18:37.450 --> 18:38.803
PETER:
I don't hear the front door.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.486
Is she gone?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.181
(girl giggling)

18:47.320 --> 18:49.459
PETER: Oh, I thought for sure
she suspected something.

18:49.490 --> 18:53.221
(sighs)

18:53.260 --> 18:55.455
Oh, yes!
(laughter over camera)

18:55.500 --> 18:57.559
Zach, give me the camera.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.763
PETER:
I'm not alone in this.
I am not alone in this.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.768
It wasn't even my idea!

19:02.800 --> 19:03.835
Let's go!

19:03.870 --> 19:06.407
GRACE:
Hurry up.
ZACH:
Yeah.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.338
PETER:
Okay.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.403
Here we go.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.701
Put a lot of
this on, right?

19:12.750 --> 19:13.876
Do we have
sprinkles?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.319
PETER: Hurry up.
She's coming back.

19:15.350 --> 19:16.510
What the heck do you do?

19:16.550 --> 19:18.438
I don't know; it's a
little too thick.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.515
All right... I'm gonna do
a little surgery.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.289
I just wanted to lay
on it a little...

19:22.320 --> 19:23.287
you know whatI mean?

19:23.330 --> 19:24.729
Straighter.
Yeah, push it...

19:24.760 --> 19:26.318
PETER:
I know, but it's sticking
to the bottom.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.918
GRACE: Dad, you were
supposed to get rose petals

19:27.960 --> 19:29.450
already petaled,
not roses.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.422
I know, but this is what I have.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.698
ZACH:
Dad, that looks...
Okay.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.391
How does that look?
That looks
terrible.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.331
GRACE:
Oh, my gosh.

19:37.370 --> 19:38.268
ZACH:
That looks expensive.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.733
PETER: There goes your
college education.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.771
(all laughing)

19:44.910 --> 19:46.502
Okay, let's get ready.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.578
The day you were talking about--
the 16th--

19:58.630 --> 20:00.427
the day he was supposedly
with Kozko...

20:00.460 --> 20:01.722
well, he couldn't have been.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.819
He was with us the whole day.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.360
Okay.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.459
I'll bring it by your office--
30 minutes.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.432
Hey, Jackie?

20:08.470 --> 20:09.732
I'm heading out.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.260
Oh, but I'm making dinner.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.278
Wow.

20:13.310 --> 20:14.436
That's big.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.538
Mmm.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.644
Where did this
come from?

20:21.680 --> 20:22.977
Well, it was on
the doorstep.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.341
I think it's
from your work.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.629
It's very nice of your
firm, wasn't it?

20:36.030 --> 20:37.998
Uh, clear, what...

20:38.030 --> 20:39.566
Oh, dear.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.502
Alicia,
what are you doing?

20:44.540 --> 20:45.802
(sighs)

20:46.840 --> 20:48.034
What else was in the basket?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.308
(stammering)

20:49.340 --> 20:50.546
I don't know. Bananas.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.468
Anything else?
I don't know.

20:52.510 --> 20:53.545
Cookies?

21:01.690 --> 21:03.248
Oh, good.
I'm so glad.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.278
Uh... you have the tape?

21:06.330 --> 21:07.490
Why, yes.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.555
And something else, too.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.420
A gift.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.292
What is it?

21:15.340 --> 21:17.331
Ham, iPods,

21:17.370 --> 21:18.962
some half-eaten bananas.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.499
Don't you ever
try to buy me.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.939
And don't you ever try
to buy my kids.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.277
You understand that?

21:41.100 --> 21:43.398
We're still working on the
other juror-- juror number 11.

21:43.430 --> 21:44.863
And we're not saying
that juror number two

21:44.900 --> 21:46.322
was definitely
bought off.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.497
We just think that
based on appearances

21:48.540 --> 21:50.667
and the fact that it
just takes one bad juror

21:50.710 --> 21:52.462
to toss out a favorable verdict,

21:52.510 --> 21:54.501
we should use
that as pretext

21:54.540 --> 21:57.304
to bump juror number two
and put in the alternate.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.039
They make a good point.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.981
Better to be
safe than sorry.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.341
What does the jury consultant
say about the alternate?

22:06.390 --> 22:08.688
The alternate's
a Republican.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.551
Not as good for us as
the current juror.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.057
So what if juror number two
wasn't bought off?

22:12.090 --> 22:14.354
I've just replaced a good juror
with a bad alternate.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.994
So, smoke out McCloon.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.668
Bring the potential bias
to the judge,

22:19.700 --> 22:21.031
but don't_insist on
replacmg juror two.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.038
Just bring it up.

22:23.070 --> 22:24.708
And if McCloon goes crazy,
you know she was bought,

22:24.740 --> 22:25.729
and fight for her expulsion.

22:25.770 --> 22:27.931
And McCloon doesn't go nuts?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.936
Just say you were
following your duty

22:29.980 --> 22:31.004
as an officer of the court.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.041
Back off.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.345
It's your call.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.151
We don't know what this means,
Your Honor.

22:42.190 --> 22:43.953
We just know it wasn't in
juror number two's voir dire.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.753
I don't even look at the guards
at my reception;

22:45.790 --> 22:48.099
I go straight down to
the parking garage.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.757
I don't understand,
Miss Lockhart--

22:49.800 --> 22:52.462
do you want juror number two
off the jury or not?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.592
Well, we're undecided,
Your Honor.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.789
We merely felt an obligation

22:54.840 --> 22:55.864
to bring it
to the court's attention.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.903
Hey, if Miss Lockhart has
any hesitation at all,

22:58.940 --> 23:00.669
I say let's dump her.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.109
Of course, we are willing
to stipulate

23:02.140 --> 23:03.072
to the fairness of this.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.078
McCLOON:
Let's just put in
the alternate.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.577
We have no objection,
Your Honor.

23:06.610 --> 23:07.816
JUDGE:
All right, fine.

23:07.850 --> 23:08.942
Juror number two is out.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.049
We'll put in
the alternate.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.981
We got played.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.019
What happened?

23:19.060 --> 23:20.596
It was a McCloon setup.

23:20.630 --> 23:22.598
He put the placemat
in our depos

23:22.630 --> 23:24.598
to get us to dump
our best juror.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.598
We don't know that.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.063
McCloon didn't fight it.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.192
He welcomed it.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.003
He wanted number two
off the jury.
Right.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.029
Because we were wrong.

23:32.070 --> 23:33.059
It wasn't number two.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.099
It was number 11.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.630
Or it was no one.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.648
Okay, maybe.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.977
But we find out.

23:39.010 --> 23:41.012
I don't know.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.449
We thought number two
looked guilty

23:42.480 --> 23:44.118
because she wanted
to serve on a jury.

23:44.150 --> 23:46.141
But she was just
being a good person.
So?

23:46.190 --> 23:49.159
So, if that X was
on juror number five

23:49.190 --> 23:51.021
or eight or anyone,

23:51.060 --> 23:53.085
we would pry into their lives
and we would ﬁnd something,

23:53.130 --> 23:55.655
because from the outside
people look guilty.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.928
Yeah, and sometimes,

23:56.960 --> 23:58.063
people from the outside
look guilty

23:58.100 --> 23:59.692
because they are guilty.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.163
I mean, what's your point?
We don't look?

24:01.200 --> 24:02.599
(sighs)

24:02.640 --> 24:03.834
I don't know.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.462
I don't like prying.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.034
Then don't.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.879
Let me.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.901
(knocking on door)

24:12.550 --> 24:14.541
Oh, thank God.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.013
I hope you can help me.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.142
I just locked myself out

24:17.180 --> 24:19.887
of 4B and I left
my purse inside.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.808
So, where's Tober?
He left earlier.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.088
Jury duty, I think.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.724
But he said to ask the super--

24:24.760 --> 24:26.057
Hey, you're Ozzie,
right?

24:26.090 --> 24:28.888
Yeah.
But I've never seen you before.

24:28.930 --> 24:30.989
Look, I know
this is awkward, okay?

24:31.030 --> 24:31.860
I met Calvin
last night.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.095
He let me sleep in
while he went off.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.665
Please.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.702
I'm already so
late for work.

24:38.740 --> 24:41.174
In our Phase I and
Phase II trials,

24:41.210 --> 24:43.849
we never once found
a causal link

24:43.880 --> 24:46.849
between Zennapril
and brain stem stroke.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.177
McCLOON:
Dr. Winsor,

24:48.220 --> 24:50.814
is it possible that Mr.
Demory took a wrong

24:50.850 --> 24:52.989
dosage of Zennapril
for his migraine headache?

24:53.020 --> 24:55.853
Well, he shouldn't have taken
any Zennapril at all.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.858
It's not indicated for
headache relief.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.152
Zennapril's not

24:59.190 --> 25:01.226
approved
for migraines?

25:01.260 --> 25:02.955
WINSOR:
No.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.262
It's a powerful drug

25:04.300 --> 25:07.224
intended only for patients
suffering schizophrenia.

25:10.870 --> 25:14.033
DANIEL: _
I want to apologize
for last night.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.173
I sent that basket before
we had our conversation.

25:16.210 --> 25:19.099
No one will_ ever _
send you anything again.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.139
Thank you.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.148
(sighs)

25:22.180 --> 25:24.182
(chuckles)

25:25.750 --> 25:28.651
I, uh...

25:28.690 --> 25:30.681
I don't mean to keep doing this.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.699
I need to ask
another favor...

25:33.730 --> 25:35.698
regarding the videotape
that you gave me.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.049
Okay.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.568
On the tape was a present--
a bracelet.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.831
I need you to look
for the receipt.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.861
Why?

25:44.910 --> 25:47.777
I want to use the videotape to
try to get Peter a new trial.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.038
I think it's very effective.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.207
But I'm _afraid that the
prosecution Will suggest

25:51.250 --> 25:53.810
that the present wasn't
paid for by Peter.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.841
Why would they
suggest that?

25:55.880 --> 25:58.849
(sighs)

25:58.890 --> 26:01.688
Mrs. Florrick, as you know,

26:01.720 --> 26:03.278
technically,
I don't represent you.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.288
I represent
your husband.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.753
And so, as much as I would like
to be completely forthcoming,

26:07.800 --> 26:10.325
in these circumstances,
I don't believe I can.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.759
So Kozko gave Peter things,

26:16.800 --> 26:19.200
and you believe Peter
regifted these things--

26:19.240 --> 26:22.175
this bracelet-- to me?

26:24.210 --> 26:26.349
I can say this:

26:26.380 --> 26:29.975
it would be helpful
if we could find the receipt.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.171
(rattling)

27:03.790 --> 27:05.280
Alicia...

27:05.320 --> 27:07.959
If it's money
you're concerned about...

27:07.990 --> 27:08.979
What?

27:09.020 --> 27:11.250
You don't have to be so proud.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.429
I know you're carrying
a great deal

27:13.460 --> 27:14.893
of responsibility right now.

27:14.930 --> 27:15.954
The rent alone...

27:16.000 --> 27:17.888
Well, I just want
you to know

27:17.930 --> 27:20.364
that I have
more than enough room.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.267
Oh!
You know, we're okay for now.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.301
But thanks.

27:30.010 --> 27:30.999
(message alert beeping)

27:34.780 --> 27:36.771
(line ringing)

27:38.420 --> 27:40.388
WOMAN:
Yeah?

27:40.420 --> 27:42.388
Hold on.
KaHnda?

27:42.420 --> 27:45.218
KALINDA:
Hello?

27:45.260 --> 27:46.454
Hi, it's Alicia.
I'm returning your call.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.821
Who was that?

27:47.860 --> 27:49.828
Donna.

27:49.860 --> 27:50.997
Look, I found out something

27:51.030 --> 27:53.021
about juror number 11,
Calvin Tober.

27:53.070 --> 27:55.231
I was talking to the super
in his building,

27:55.270 --> 27:56.862
_ and he let me
into his apartment.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.868
Why would he let you
into his apartment?

27:58.910 --> 28:01.276
You really want to know?

28:01.310 --> 28:03.369
No.

28:03.410 --> 28:05.275
Here's the thing:
Tober's bank account--

28:05.310 --> 28:08.245
he just deposited
$20,000 in cash.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.283
I think we have
our bribed juror.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.120
Yes, it's ours.

28:26.170 --> 28:27.228
You lost the receipt?

28:27.270 --> 28:29.261
And I need a copy
for my tax records.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.267
It's a beautiful piece.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.801
One of our finest.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.808
When was it purchased?

28:33.840 --> 28:35.034
Um...

28:35.080 --> 28:36.331
February or March.

28:36.380 --> 28:37.369
Maybe January.

28:37.410 --> 28:40.447
I'm sorry,
you said "Florrick."

28:40.480 --> 28:42.345
Yes.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.416
I found the receipt, but
it's not under Florrick.

28:44.450 --> 28:46.418
Might it be under
a different name?

28:46.450 --> 28:47.883
I'm not sure.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.911
What name do you have?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.382
I'm sorry,

28:52.430 --> 28:54.921
I'm not able to give out
that information.

28:59.830 --> 29:02.958
Could the name be Kozko?

29:05.010 --> 29:06.432
I'm sorry.

29:06.470 --> 29:08.472
I'm afraid I can't give out
that information.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.471
KALINDA:
Hey!

29:13.510 --> 29:15.842
So, I tracked down
Tober's ex-wife.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.440
She says he was five months
behind on alimony.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.412
Then last week,
he paid her ten grand.

29:20.450 --> 29:23.453
He claims he took out a second
mortgage on his house.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.185
Is that all?

29:25.230 --> 29:27.289
Tober doesn't own a house.

29:30.130 --> 29:31.825
Did you hear me?

29:31.870 --> 29:33.497
Yeah.

29:33.530 --> 29:35.259
Kalinda, do you know
someone named Kozko?

29:35.300 --> 29:37.268
Gerald Kozko?

29:37.300 --> 29:38.938
The Real Estate Developer.

29:38.970 --> 29:42.474
What does he have to do
with my husband?

29:42.510 --> 29:45.001
I don't know-- does he have
anything to do with him?

29:45.050 --> 29:47.143
You worked at the State's
Attorney's office for how long?

29:47.180 --> 29:48.374
Two years.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.047
Did you ever see anything?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.342
Like what?

29:51.390 --> 29:54.359
Payoffs, gifts--
I don't know.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.381
I don't even know
if I want to know.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.354
Look, you don't go to the
State's Attorney's Office

30:01.400 --> 30:02.822
to find saints.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.368
I'll get back to you
about Tober.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.594
If his payoff's $35,000,

30:07.630 --> 30:10.497
then McCloon owes him
another $15,000.

30:10.540 --> 30:13.202
My guess is he gets it
before deliberations.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.333
That's at the end of today.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.836
I better rush then.

30:19.550 --> 30:20.642
McCLOON:
Objection, Your Honor!

30:20.680 --> 30:23.444
This is a research document,
not promotional material.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.310
JUDGE:
Overruled.

30:24.350 --> 30:27.183
DIANE: Then let me
continue quoting:

30:27.220 --> 30:30.212
"Primary outcome for Zennapril
include a 40% reduction

30:30.260 --> 30:32.524
in the average frequencies
of migraines."

30:32.560 --> 30:34.949
We test drugs for all
possible outcomes.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.991
It doesn't mean that
we recommend them.

30:39.030 --> 30:42.238
Could you please
tell the court...

30:42.270 --> 30:44.329
what this is, Doctor?

30:44.370 --> 30:45.928
Objection.
We haven't seen this.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.507
Discovery materials, item 469.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.472
I'll help you, sir.

30:49.510 --> 30:52.547
This document is an
application to the EMEA,

30:52.580 --> 30:55.219
seeking approval to market
Zennapril in Europe

30:55.250 --> 30:57.138
as a migraine medication.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.609
Am I correct?

31:02.990 --> 31:04.958
Yes.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.548
Filed 20 months ago.

31:06.590 --> 31:09.525
Dr. Winsor,

31:09.560 --> 31:11.198
would you please
tell the court

31:11.230 --> 31:13.892
whose signature is
on this application?

31:14.940 --> 31:17.534
Uh, my signature.

31:17.570 --> 31:19.208
DIANE: No further
questions, Your Honor.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.208
Then that concludes
the trial testimony.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.502
We'll finish the day
with summations

31:22.540 --> 31:23.905
and jury instructions,

31:23.950 --> 31:26.248
and then ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

31:26.280 --> 31:29.909
_the trial moves
into your hands.

31:39.530 --> 31:41.452
(starts engine)

32:38.220 --> 32:40.211
(quiet groan)

32:45.630 --> 32:48.394
DIANE: And she's sure
it was a payoff?

32:48.430 --> 32:50.091
No. She saw an envelope
exchange hands,

32:50.130 --> 32:52.291
but she doesn't know
what was inside the envelope.

32:52.330 --> 32:53.695
And she didn't
see the driver?

32:53.730 --> 32:55.630
No. She saw
a dark green SUV.

32:55.670 --> 32:58.503
Uh, Kalinda saw
a partial plate-- J15.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.134
She's running it now,
crossing it with make and model,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.704
but that could take a while.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.002
Start with McCloon's
legal team.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.176
Oh, I don't know.

33:05.210 --> 33:06.347
The jury's already
deliberating.

33:06.380 --> 33:07.540
They've sent word to the judge

33:07.580 --> 33:08.478
they may have a verdict
by today.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.715
So if we pull the
trigger, we do it now.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.513
DIANE: I'd have to bring
the judge everything.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.711
The place mat,
the $35,000, the alimony.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.411
You request another juror now,
it'd be a definite mistrial.

33:17.460 --> 33:18.484
(Diane sighs
heavily)

33:18.530 --> 33:21.090
DIANE:
But I feel like the
jury was With me.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.552
I mean, the summation--
they were nodding.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.420
They want to give this to us.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.563
Yes, unless Juror
11 torpedoes it.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.535
Either way, we're
risking a mistrial.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.261
This isn't law.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.073
WILL:
We're talking about

33:34.110 --> 33:36.237
a felony crime here;
we have an obligation.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.246
(knocking on door)

33:42.280 --> 33:44.510
The judge wants
you in chambers.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.485
This should be interesting.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.717
In the next ten minutes, we're
going to figure something out.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.625
You're Honor, I would like
to request a private meeting.
Your Honor, may I please...?

33:52.660 --> 33:54.651
In the meantime,
I would like silence.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.455
Not McCloon silence,

33:57.500 --> 33:59.422
not Lockhart silence,

33:59.470 --> 34:00.596
just silence.

34:00.630 --> 34:01.767
Unless I point to you,

34:01.800 --> 34:03.688
you will
not speak.
Your Honor?

34:03.740 --> 34:05.059
Sergeant Largon!

34:06.240 --> 34:08.071
Sergeant, come in, please.

34:08.110 --> 34:10.078
And wait right there.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.475
Anyone who speaks
without my permission

34:11.510 --> 34:12.841
will be held in contempt.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.416
Now, the jury
has reached a verdict.

34:14.450 --> 34:15.747
I'm holding that verdict

34:15.780 --> 34:17.418
until we settle an issue
that has arisen.

34:17.450 --> 34:21.659
The foreman has approached me
about being followed by someone

34:21.690 --> 34:23.578
from one of your legal teams.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.087
Who would that be?

34:27.290 --> 34:28.655
You may speak.
Your Honor,

34:28.700 --> 34:30.725
we have reason to believe
that Mr. McCloon bribed

34:30.760 --> 34:32.091
one of the jurors.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.324
We intended

34:33.370 --> 34:35.099
to bring these charges
to Your Honor,

34:35.140 --> 34:37.631
but first, we wanted to be
certain of our information.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.831
And so you had one
of the jurors followed?

34:42.340 --> 34:44.240
McCLOON:
Your Honor,

34:44.280 --> 34:45.440
I am stunned.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.777
JUDGE:
Mr. McCloon, without

34:46.810 --> 34:48.277
the outrage, please.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.447
Clearly, Miss Lockhart
has nothing solid,

34:50.480 --> 34:51.742
and she's trying to torpedo

34:51.790 --> 34:53.678
this verdict
before it comes in.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.551
_ She's worried
it won't go in her favor.

34:55.590 --> 34:56.784
JUDGE:
All right, Miss Lockart, I am

34:56.820 --> 34:58.458
holding you in contempt.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.651
You owe the legal
defense fund $80,000

35:00.690 --> 35:02.692
to be paid no later than Friday

35:02.730 --> 35:04.197
of next week.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.788
And I think
I am damn well owed an apology.

35:05.830 --> 35:06.762
JUDGE:
Uh, uh, uh!

35:06.800 --> 35:08.461
I did not point to you.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.901
That'll be $10,000,
Mr. McCloon.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.430
Now...

35:13.470 --> 35:15.677
we are all going back
into that courtroom,

35:15.710 --> 35:17.905
and we are all living
with this verdict.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.670
If you have evidence
of jury tampering,

35:20.710 --> 35:23.144
Miss Lockhart,
take it up on appeal.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.340
Too many people
have selflessly

35:24.390 --> 35:25.516
invested their time

35:25.550 --> 35:29.486
for your playground tactics
to throw this into a mistrial.

35:29.520 --> 35:30.817
Now, that's it.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.455
JUDGE:
Ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

36:03.490 --> 36:05.219
have you reached a verdict?

36:07.930 --> 36:09.852
Yes, Your Honor.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.397
JUDGE:
And what is your verdict?

36:16.240 --> 36:19.368
"We, the jury,
find for Raymond Demory

36:19.410 --> 36:20.809
"and against

36:20.840 --> 36:23.707
"the defendant Zennapril
Pharmaceutical.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.743
"And we assess damages
in the sum of $800,000

36:26.780 --> 36:28.418
"in compensatory damages

36:28.450 --> 36:30.816
_ and_t_hree million
in punitive damages."

36:32.550 --> 36:34.415
JUDGE:
Thank you for your service

36:34.460 --> 36:35.916
to the State of Illinois.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.382
The jury is dismissed.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.887
Court adjourned.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.490
(applause)

36:45.570 --> 36:46.889
Settle, and I won't
pursue an appeal.

36:46.930 --> 36:49.865
I still have _
my class action clients.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.607
Right. I'll get you some
numbers by the end of the day.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.776
So, we were wrong?

37:03.820 --> 37:05.981
It happens.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.488
People sometimes
just look guilty.

37:09.590 --> 37:11.581
CAROL:
Alicia?

37:23.840 --> 37:25.967
Thank you.

37:26.010 --> 37:28.604
Oh, it was...
it was all Diane.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.944
I want you to
have something.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.315
These are the people
that you helped today.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.827
(sighs)

37:45.860 --> 37:47.020
Thanks again.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.049
(laughs)

37:48.090 --> 37:50.354
It really is amazing.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.326
Is it?

37:53.370 --> 37:54.962
Yes.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.367
Ever been
to The Hungry Kitten?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.366
The restaurant?

38:00.410 --> 38:02.605
Sure. Ray loves it.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.073
And you borrowed
our deposition books?

38:04.110 --> 38:05.748
Yes.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.304
Why?

38:08.350 --> 38:11.012
Wow.

38:13.790 --> 38:16.850
Diane wanted us to look through
Ray's earlier statements.

38:16.890 --> 38:18.551
You didn't have to do it.

38:18.590 --> 38:19.989
You would have won.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.621
We did win.

38:54.630 --> 38:56.894
They bribed
the foreman.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.921
Our clients did.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.676
They drive a
dark green SUV.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.598
Their license
plate prefix

39:10.640 --> 39:12.039
is J15.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.675
There was no
whistle-blower.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.711
Our clients bribed the jury.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.788
Maybe.

39:21.820 --> 39:22.912
No. It's true.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.053
We need to bring this
to the judge.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.819
We already did.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.657
We brought our suspicions
to the judge,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.122
and he overruled us.

39:30.160 --> 39:34.392
Yes, but now we know.

39:34.440 --> 39:38.092
We fulfilled our obligation
under the law.

39:38.140 --> 39:41.473
It's wrong.

39:41.510 --> 39:43.478
No.

39:43.510 --> 39:46.604
We follow the law, Alicia.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.901
Sometimes it's wrong,

39:47.950 --> 39:49.747
sometimes it's right,

39:49.780 --> 39:50.940
but we always follow the law.

39:50.980 --> 39:56.054
And today, you helped a lot
of people in pain ﬁnd justice.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.837
(door rattling,
closes with an echoing bang)

40:15.110 --> 40:16.475
PETER: _
How are you d0ing?

40:16.510 --> 40:18.068
Good.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.203
I hear that work is going well.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.138
It is. It's good.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.068
You sound like Grace.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.485
"How's school?"
"Good."

40:25.520 --> 40:26.942
"How are your teachers?"
"Good."

40:28.190 --> 40:30.988
Are you having fun?

40:31.020 --> 40:34.490
_That's the most
important thing.

40:34.530 --> 40:36.054
(laughs)

40:36.100 --> 40:37.829
Fun as Disneyland.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.999
Well, I'm... I'm, uh...

40:40.030 --> 40:42.134
I'm glad you're making a life
for yourself.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.058
It gives you a break
from this whole...

40:44.100 --> 40:46.068
situation.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.463
Right, Daniel?

40:48.540 --> 40:51.031
Alicia can handle herself,
I know that.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.178
So...

40:56.220 --> 40:57.949
(clears throat)
Uh...

40:57.980 --> 41:00.881
Daniel and I wanted to talk
to you about something.

41:00.920 --> 41:05.027
Alicia, um, we've been going
over our appeal strategy,

41:05.060 --> 41:06.186
and, um...

41:06.230 --> 41:07.857
(clears throat)
...we need you to

41:07.890 --> 41:09.755
do something
that we didn't expect.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.065
We need you to testify.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.168
PETER:
I'm sorry,

41:19.210 --> 41:21.599
but we have gone over this
every which way we could, and...

41:21.640 --> 41:22.834
DANIEL:
We need you to say

41:22.880 --> 41:24.029
on the stand
when you found out

41:24.080 --> 41:25.843
about the affair,
so that we can show

41:25.880 --> 41:29.008
that Peter was lying
to protect you.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.114
Oh, um, from the affair.

41:34.150 --> 41:35.117
PETER:
Well, I mean,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.218
it's Bill Clinton
all over again.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.581
Remember what we used
to say about him?

41:38.630 --> 41:39.949
They were using sex
to crucify him.

41:39.990 --> 41:41.526
They're doing
exactly the same thing to me.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.697
Crucifying you?

41:42.730 --> 41:45.619
DANIEL:
Alicia,

41:45.670 --> 41:47.262
we need you to do this.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.560
I wouldn't ask you
ifI didn't need it.

41:56.910 --> 41:59.140
Will you testify?
