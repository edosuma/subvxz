00:03.469 --> 00:08.772
So, Eric, have you made
your Christmas list for Santa yet?

00:08.842 --> 00:12.278
Well, um, I was going to,
but then I turned 1 0.

00:14.914 --> 00:17.474
- ( Sighs )
- Steven made his.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.041
T-shirts.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.284
Well, I guess I could ask for a cassette player
for the Vista Cruiser...

00:24.357 --> 00:27.292
like I have for
the last... 80 years.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.387
But I won't get one, so I might as well
just ask for a raincoat.

00:32.465 --> 00:36.265
Oh, so you want
a raincoat?

00:37.937 --> 00:41.202
Man, remember when you used to come
downstairs Christmas morning...

00:41.274 --> 00:44.573
and you'd see your stocking over
the fire all filled with toys?

00:44.644 --> 00:49.308
Well, one year, I saw my mom's panty hose
on the radiator...

00:49.382 --> 00:52.818
and, uh, Uncle ''Strange Man''
sleeping on the floor.

00:54.687 --> 00:57.349
He had a red nose though.
That's Christmassy.

00:57.424 --> 01:00.018
Yeah, Christmas
used to be so cool.

01:00.093 --> 01:03.859
- Now it's just another day.
- Okay. Okay.

01:03.930 --> 01:07.161
It sounds like somebody needs
a little holiday cheer.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.100
I know!
( Laughing )

01:10.170 --> 01:12.570
You could direct the Christmas pageant
at the church.

01:13.907 --> 01:18.139
Hey, yeah, that's the worst idea
I've ever heard!

01:18.211 --> 01:21.271
Eric, you used to love that pageant
when you were a little boy.

01:21.347 --> 01:24.874
And you need some Christmas spirit.
And I already signed you up.

01:27.287 --> 01:31.383
Well, it was fun
when we were kids.

01:31.458 --> 01:35.121
Then again, so was eating crayons.
Yeah, okay.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.629
- I'll do it.
- Good. Okay, now, Steven-

01:37.697 --> 01:39.688
No!

01:39.766 --> 01:42.394
No!

01:42.469 --> 01:44.403
Oh.

01:44.471 --> 01:47.463
So you won't be in a show about
how there was no room at the inn...

01:47.540 --> 01:50.771
even though this innkeeper
gave you a room?

01:51.845 --> 01:54.040
Your guilt has
no power over me!

01:55.482 --> 01:57.473
I'll do it.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.812
Fa la la la la La la la- boned

02:34.053 --> 02:35.987
<i>Ho-ho-ho.!</i>

02:41.427 --> 02:45.921
Guys, check this out.
It looks just like when we were kids.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.160
And look,
the wise-men gifts:

02:48.234 --> 02:50.725
gold, myrrh, and-

02:52.138 --> 02:54.572
Hyde, I think this one's yours.

02:58.978 --> 03:02.573
That'd be my Baggie
of frankincense.

03:02.649 --> 03:06.016
Well, if it isn't
Mr. First-time Director.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.645
I thought I'd direct,
but the church board...

03:08.721 --> 03:12.521
whose average age is...
nearly dead...

03:12.592 --> 03:15.152
feels that I don't speak
to the younger generation.

03:15.228 --> 03:18.595
Oh, Pastor Dave, I loved last year's
<i>Silent Night,Jazzy Night.</i>

03:18.665 --> 03:20.633
It was really funny.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.760
It was a drama.

03:25.605 --> 03:29.097
You guys, you guys! Great news.

03:29.175 --> 03:32.474
<i>Rudolph, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,</i>
<i>The Little Drummer Boy</i>-

03:32.545 --> 03:34.740
They're all on TV this week!

03:39.986 --> 03:42.216
We can watch 'em!

03:43.289 --> 03:45.416
Yeah! We can wear our p.j.'s...

03:45.491 --> 03:47.482
and eat gumdrops
and drink Kool-Aid.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.528
Hooray!

03:49.596 --> 03:52.963
( Laughing )
Yeah!

03:53.032 --> 03:56.365
Okay, guys, let's talk about
your parts.

03:56.436 --> 04:00.463
Okay, Eric, I want
to be the Virgin Mary.

04:00.540 --> 04:04.408
See, she's pure and holy
and rides a unicorn.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.579
No,Jackie, she doesn't
ride a unicorn.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.643
She does now.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.646
A white unicorn
with speckles.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.351
Write that down.

04:20.426 --> 04:25.159
Hey, is there anyone in this show who
just kind of lies there and does nothing?

04:25.231 --> 04:27.597
Um, there's the baby
in the manger.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.658
I call baby in the manger!

04:33.806 --> 04:37.139
Uh, Eric, I don't want
to playJoseph as a carpenter.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.804
Oh, how about if I play
him as a spaceman?

04:42.482 --> 04:47.146
Okay, uh, Kelso, I don't thinkJesus
was the son of a spaceman.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.747
Oh, really? Well, where
do you think God lives?

04:52.925 --> 04:55.155
It's true, man.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.966
- <i>( Christmas Carol )</i>
- What the hell?

05:09.342 --> 05:11.469
It's the Russians!

05:17.450 --> 05:19.543
Aw, geez.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.821
- Bob!

05:22.889 --> 05:25.483
<i>( Bob )</i>
<i>Hey there, hi there, ho-ho-ho there.!</i>

05:27.760 --> 05:31.560
Bob, it's midnight.
Turn that crap off.

05:31.631 --> 05:35.499
- <i>( Continues )</i>
- <i>What would I do that for?</i>

05:35.568 --> 05:38.401
<i>Hey, check out</i>
<i>the keister on Mrs. Claus.</i>

05:45.278 --> 05:47.746
Bob, are you drunk?

05:49.015 --> 05:51.677
<i>I'm not sober.!</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:03.325
Eric, I have a little
problem with my part.

06:03.396 --> 06:07.492
Um, it turns out you have me
playing a wise <i>man.</i>

06:09.702 --> 06:12.637
Why can't there be
any wise <i>women?</i>

06:12.705 --> 06:16.072
Yeah, okay. I'll take that up
with the guy who wrote the Bible.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.303
Let me get back to you.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.308
Okay, Kelso, you are now
playing a wise man.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.980
- Or a space wise man.
- Better. Better.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:37.196 --> 06:39.824
How come the foreign guy
has to play the shepherd?

06:42.101 --> 06:46.629
I have never herded sheep
in my life.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.867
Well, once, as a favor.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.437
Why can't I be a lifeguard?

06:53.513 --> 06:56.175
Or a space lifeguard.

06:58.284 --> 07:01.811
Then I could herd all
the ladies into the pool.

07:04.490 --> 07:07.482
''Into the pool, ladies!''

07:07.560 --> 07:10.552
Now, that's a good role.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.490
Okay, uh, everyone?
Everybody?

07:16.669 --> 07:20.435
Um, all of your ideas are all...

07:20.506 --> 07:23.373
um, stupid.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.378
Okay, moving on. Uh, at the end of the play,
when Santa comes in the door-

07:26.446 --> 07:28.380
- Ooh! How about-
- Kelso, I swear to God...

07:28.448 --> 07:31.178
if you say Space Santa,
I'm gonna kick you in the head.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.314
Never mind.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.725
( Screams )

07:56.209 --> 08:02.079
Red, are you stealing Bob's
Christmas decorations?

08:04.851 --> 08:08.685
It's only stealing if you, uh-
if you keep it.

08:09.956 --> 08:12.686
I'm throwing
all this crap away.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.462
Oh, my God.
I'm married to the Grinch.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.789
I'm Mrs. Grinch.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.928
Well, as long as you're not
Mrs. Tattletale, we'll be fine.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.211
Leo, these guys are
driving me crazy in there.

08:32.278 --> 08:37.113
Do you know what they
think is Christmassy? Unicorns.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.913
Right- No, I'm sorry.
Space unicorns.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.280
Well, that's redundant.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.853
Do you have any idea what
this is gonna look like, man?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.601
( Folk )

09:00.673 --> 09:03.107
Shark!
Everybody out of the water!

09:03.175 --> 09:05.575
And off with your tops!

09:07.580 --> 09:09.946
Make way!
Virgin Mother coming through!

09:10.016 --> 09:11.950
<i>( Motorcycle Rewing )</i>

09:15.521 --> 09:19.355
We come bearing gifts
of frankincense, myrrh...

09:19.425 --> 09:22.053
and <i>Led Zeppelin IV.</i>

09:22.128 --> 09:26.155
Now, let me get a look at that
cute little baby <i>girl</i> Jesus!

09:30.336 --> 09:34.170

09:35.541 --> 09:38.032
( Singing Christmas Rock Song )

09:41.280 --> 09:43.214
( Ends )

09:43.282 --> 09:46.012
I'm just gonna go home.
<i>Holiday Inn's</i> on TV.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.417
Now, <i>that's</i> Christmas.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.957
You can't go home, man.
This pageant's your chance...

09:53.025 --> 09:57.689
to spread some Christmas spirit,
and that's contagious, like V.D.

10:01.701 --> 10:06.104
I just- I don't think
I have it anymore, Leo.

10:06.172 --> 10:09.403
Ah, don't be fooled, man.
V.D. comes back.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.045
No, not-

10:20.119 --> 10:22.110
Okay. Yeah,
I'll watch for that.

10:24.624 --> 10:29.027
So. Dipping into
the frankincense, I see.

10:29.095 --> 10:33.828
Well, no more of that. Okay? We're gonna
do this play the way it was meant to be done.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.561
And no spacemen.

10:38.137 --> 10:43.097
And anyone who doesn't like that
is no Christmas friend of mine.

10:43.175 --> 10:47.635
And we should be a little bit nicer to those
of us who want to watch Christmas specials.

10:47.713 --> 10:50.307
I mean, when Rudolph's nose
shone so bright...

10:50.383 --> 10:52.783
and Santa realized he could
guide the sleigh at night-

10:52.852 --> 10:55.582
That was a great moment
in American history.

10:56.789 --> 11:01.317
Kelso, Rudolph was small,
had a girlie voice...

11:01.394 --> 11:03.692
and I'm pretty sure he was
a little light in the hooves...

11:03.763 --> 11:07.096
if you know what I mean.
( Chuckles )

11:07.166 --> 11:10.158
Of course he was light in the hooves.
He could fly! ( Chuckles )

11:12.972 --> 11:17.341
( Chuckling )
I would have guessed Prancer.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.405
Well, you've all ignored me, so I'll take that
as a resounding vote of confidence.

11:23.482 --> 11:26.815
Guys, let's do this thing!

11:26.886 --> 11:30.788
- What on God's green earth?
- But Pastor Dave, I was just-

11:30.856 --> 11:35.259
I know what you were doing.
I recognize that smell from the AC/DC concert.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.795
I was handing out leaflets!

11:39.265 --> 11:42.200
- No, but I wasn't-
- Eric Forman, you're fired.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.539
You know what?
Fine.

11:52.344 --> 11:57.145
Rudolph had a girlfriend!
Her name was Clarice.

11:57.216 --> 12:02.586
She thought he was cute. Okay, if
anyone was gay, it was that-that Hermey.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.954
No straight elf
has hair like that.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.117
( Clicks Tongue )

12:15.401 --> 12:20.498
Well, as you may know by now,
I had to let Eric go.

12:20.572 --> 12:24.531
Wait, you fired Eric?
Who's gonna direct the play?

12:24.610 --> 12:29.775
I guess that responsibility
falls ''unto me.''

12:29.848 --> 12:33.306
And I am willing to be the reluctant hero
on this year's pageant...

12:33.385 --> 12:36.548
and whip all you
ne'er-do-wells into shape.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.833
Okay, kids,
that was a good one.

12:50.903 --> 12:54.134
Now, let's work on the scene
where you untie me.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.197
And action!

13:03.248 --> 13:06.513
Give me my
stuff back, Red!

13:06.585 --> 13:09.884
Don't know what
you're talking about, Bob.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.617
And no!

13:12.691 --> 13:14.625
Oh, Red,just give it back.

13:14.693 --> 13:17.526
You don't want anybody
to have a happy Christmas!

13:17.596 --> 13:20.622
Oh, you want happy?
Drink another six-pack.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.828
Oh, this is nice.
This is great.

13:25.904 --> 13:29.203
I guess we have a new tradition here:
the annual yuletide fight.

13:29.274 --> 13:35.008
God, can't anybody just act decent
for one freakin' day of the year?

13:37.015 --> 13:39.006
( Groans )

13:42.821 --> 13:46.951
Well, out of
the mouths of babes, huh?

13:48.460 --> 13:52.021
Well, fine.

13:52.097 --> 13:55.965
Bob, your decorations are in the Dumpster
behind the liquor store.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.436
Thanks, Red.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.308
If I had mistletoe,
I'd kiss you.

14:07.379 --> 14:11.941
Yeah, well, if I had ''mistlefoot,''
it'd be in your ass.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.781
( Laughing )

14:20.292 --> 14:23.557
You know what
I would like for Christmas?

14:23.629 --> 14:27.793
No more talk about you putting your foot
in other people's rear ends.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.128
Maybe next year, Kitty.

14:37.910 --> 14:41.539
Whoa, dudes.
What'd you do, man?

14:41.613 --> 14:44.844
Leo, man. We're just about
to light the Dave.

14:46.485 --> 14:51.081
I can't believe you guys.
You managed to bring a man of God to tears.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.722
I'm not crying!

14:54.793 --> 14:57.455
I'm talking about me, man.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.020
You know, you guys can hassle
your skinny friend, Eric...

15:00.098 --> 15:02.965
but when it comes down
to a fundamental moral core...

15:03.035 --> 15:05.765
he's the only one of you
that's got one.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.899
So, congratulations.
You've ruined Christmas.

15:13.545 --> 15:18.175
Oh, man. Leo's right.
I mean, this probably isn't our finest hour.

15:18.250 --> 15:22.152
I don't know.
It's pretty damn fine.

15:22.221 --> 15:26.783
Well,Jackie, you know,
since everything's ruined...

15:26.859 --> 15:30.659
we could- I don't know-
go home and watch <i>Rudolph.</i>

15:33.165 --> 15:36.191
Michael, those shows
are for babies.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.431
But I want to watch it!

15:39.504 --> 15:41.495
I wanna!

15:41.573 --> 15:44.565
Grow up, Michael.

15:44.643 --> 15:47.976
( Whimpering )
You never let me have any fun!

15:51.216 --> 15:54.743
You guys, I feel
kind of bad about Eric.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.913
- Yeah, maybe we should go find him.
- Yeah.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.514
Or we could stay here
and wrap Dave.

16:00.926 --> 16:05.295
- I say, get Eric!
- Come on.

16:07.165 --> 16:09.656
Uh, guys?

16:09.735 --> 16:11.726
Oh, right.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.263
( Grunts )
There you go.

16:22.314 --> 16:26.182
Oh, honey,
you looked so sad.

16:26.251 --> 16:31.712
I am gonna let you open your
big Christmas present early. ( Chuckles )

16:31.790 --> 16:35.556
- Wow, it's kind of the size of-
- ( Chuckling )

16:35.627 --> 16:37.618
And it's kind
of heavy like-

16:37.696 --> 16:42.429
- I knew you wanted one.
- I can't believe that you got me- a rain coat!

16:45.037 --> 16:48.734
See, it's London Fog!
Did I fool you?

16:48.807 --> 16:51.275
I put rocks in the bottom,
so it would seem heavy.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.073
( Chuckles )

16:57.316 --> 16:59.580
- That's clever.
- ( Laughing )

16:59.651 --> 17:02.984
Okay, now. I'm gonna
wrap it back up.

17:03.055 --> 17:07.013
You can open it Christmas morning
and pretend you're surprised.

17:07.092 --> 17:11.290
Uh-huh. So, we got
that to look forward to.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.593
- ( Laughs )
- ( Chuckling ) Okay!

17:17.469 --> 17:19.460
( Muttering )

17:28.714 --> 17:30.147
Huh?

17:30.215 --> 17:33.651
What's the matter, Kelso?

17:33.719 --> 17:36.153
Rudolph,
I can't watch you anymore.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.487
- My friends say I'm too old.
- Ho-Ho-Hold the phone!

17:40.559 --> 17:43.119
Too old for Christmas?
That's nonsense.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.857
Yeah, but everyone's
makin' fun of me.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.695
You know, Kelso, people used to laugh
and call me names.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.930
''They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
join in any reindeer games.''

17:52.004 --> 17:55.770
- So, what did you do?
- I kicked 'em in the face.

17:55.841 --> 17:59.777
- Blitzen bled like a faucet.
- <i>( Tapping )</i>

17:59.845 --> 18:01.836
Little Drummer Boy,
what are you doing here?

18:01.913 --> 18:06.976
- Come, they told me.
- No, but what am I supposed to do?

18:07.052 --> 18:09.953
All my friends are gonna think that
I'm a baby if I keep watching your shows.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.354
Aw, screw those dumb-asses!

18:12.424 --> 18:16.827
If they're too old for Christmas specials,
that's their loss.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.329
Can I go now?
I'm very cold.

18:19.398 --> 18:24.631
Kelso, as long as you really,
really believe in our magical world...

18:24.703 --> 18:27.638
nothing in life
can ever hurt you.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.231
So, I can watch.

18:30.308 --> 18:32.503
( Chuckles )
I can watch!

18:32.577 --> 18:36.513
Whoo-hoo! I can watch!

18:36.581 --> 18:40.608
I can watch! I can watch!
( Laughing )

18:48.727 --> 18:51.355
- Look at that face.
- What a nice kid.
- <i>So happy.</i>

18:57.936 --> 19:00.427
I'm not too late.
I haven't missed them!

19:00.505 --> 19:03.702
- Hey, Dave.
- Uh, Michael?

19:03.775 --> 19:06.539
- A little help?
- Oh.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.404
That wasn't fun.
One of the lights burned my neck.

19:12.284 --> 19:18.052
You know, Pastor Dave, the only reason
we mess with you is 'cause we like you.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.523
You do? You do!

19:20.592 --> 19:23.755
I'm cool! I'm cool!

19:33.338 --> 19:38.332
Oh, well, if it isn't the dill-holes
of Christmas past, present and future.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.106
We came to talk to you
about the pageant.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.707
- Dave said he'll un-fire you.
- 'Cause I'm cool!

19:45.784 --> 19:48.685
And we'll do the pageant
however you want.

19:48.753 --> 19:51.347
Yeah, I set 'em straight, man.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.790
Look, Forman,just
come on back, all right?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.454
- Yeah, it'll be fun.
- Yeah. We can all be together.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.793
I mean, it's Christmas,
you know?

19:59.865 --> 20:02.299
( Singsong Voice )
Plus, we got you a present.

20:05.737 --> 20:09.605
Oh, man.
A cassette deck.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.541
You guys, thanks.

20:14.613 --> 20:18.049
- So, you'll come back?
- Yeah, okay.

20:18.116 --> 20:22.450

20:37.169 --> 20:40.036
(Jackie )
Look, it's snowing!

20:40.105 --> 20:42.699
Yeah, I hooked up
the snow machine.

20:42.774 --> 20:46.574
Don't nobody smoke though.
This stuff might be toxic.

20:47.579 --> 20:51.515
Ohh, a tape player.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.552
Didn't know you wanted one of those!
( Chuckles )

20:56.021 --> 20:58.012
Isn't it beautiful?

20:58.089 --> 21:01.422
Hey, Steven.
Fix that light up there, will ya?

21:02.694 --> 21:07.324
- Ah, I dropped my candy!
- Oh, no!

21:08.533 --> 21:12.094
Oh! Ah, my knee!

Behold! The virgin has given birth.

Isn't he cute? He's got my eyes.

21:37.395 --> 21:40.228
And my hair.

21:40.298 --> 21:43.734
Hark, we come bearing gifts!
