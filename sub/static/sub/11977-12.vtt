17:05.117 --> 17:07.318
Come sit down, will you?

17:07.319 --> 17:10.655
So I tried a few
different things,
and I can't crack it.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.257
Give it a shot, will ya?

17:12.258 --> 17:15.460
Meaning you turned it on
and discovered there was
a passcode?

17:15.461 --> 17:17.962
Pretty much.

17:17.963 --> 17:19.864
You shouldn't open
other people's mail.

17:19.865 --> 17:23.402
-(CHUCKLES)
Said the computer hacker.
- It's a felony.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.473
(BEEPS)

17:28.040 --> 17:29.408
Whoops.

17:30.376 --> 17:32.477
Whoops what?

17:32.478 --> 17:36.147
Is it possible this computer
belongs to a seriously
security-minded individual?

17:36.148 --> 17:37.882
Yeah, it's possible.

17:37.883 --> 17:41.252
Well, that explains
the government-level firewall
I just initiated.

17:41.253 --> 17:43.155
Are you telling me
you're locked out?

17:44.390 --> 17:45.891
Irrevocably.

17:49.628 --> 17:50.929
What's that?

17:50.930 --> 17:54.900
"C4. NC3. NF6."
It's a chess game.

17:55.835 --> 17:57.236
Let me see?

18:00.606 --> 18:02.607
You don't think that's weird?

18:02.608 --> 18:06.311
That an NSA analyst
is a chess nerd?
No, I don't.

18:06.312 --> 18:08.680
Queen's knight defense
to an England gambit?

18:08.681 --> 18:10.915
Who does this guy think he is,
Henri Grob?

18:10.916 --> 18:14.453
I mean, look at this,
bishop to C6, knight F4?

18:15.120 --> 18:16.488
They're terrible.

18:16.489 --> 18:18.022
Okay, so what?

18:18.023 --> 18:19.824
So, anyone who's going to
spend the time playing

18:19.825 --> 18:22.961
by correspondence
couldn't possibly be this bad.

18:22.962 --> 18:24.762
You're saying it's not a real game?

18:24.763 --> 18:26.298
I don't know.

18:27.466 --> 18:29.501
The Russians used to use
postal chess to send

18:29.502 --> 18:32.604
messages to each other
all the time during
the Cold War.

18:32.605 --> 18:36.308
If I worked for the NSA,
and I didn't want anyone
tracking my communications...

18:37.376 --> 18:39.878
This would be a way to do it.

18:39.879 --> 18:42.313
You know what, maybe she's
sending directions
to her own PO Box,

18:42.314 --> 18:44.816
then someone else
is picking them up?

18:44.817 --> 18:46.518
Grab your stuff, let's go.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.029
I'll be right back.

18:58.497 --> 19:00.365
Go ahead. Go ahead.

19:15.014 --> 19:16.715
Hey, how are ya?

19:18.017 --> 19:20.852
My boss is real adamant
about getting this to
Mia Rochlane today.

19:20.853 --> 19:22.787
Is there anything you can do for me?

19:22.788 --> 19:25.723
Let me see if I got
contact information on
the box owner.

19:25.724 --> 19:27.126
(TYPING)

19:28.093 --> 19:29.494
I got a number here.
I'll give her a shout.

19:29.495 --> 19:31.997
Great, thanks a lot, appreciate it.

19:48.314 --> 19:50.082
So, what now?

19:50.749 --> 19:52.116
We wait.

19:52.117 --> 19:54.353
You mean, like, just sit here?

19:54.820 --> 19:56.888
Yeah.

19:56.889 --> 19:59.524
What happens if
nobody shows up today?

19:59.525 --> 20:01.393
Then we wait tomorrow.

20:03.295 --> 20:06.631
I spoke to your scheduler,
she seems to feel
you're a bit of a nighthawk.

20:06.632 --> 20:09.567
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.

20:09.568 --> 20:12.904
Well, you've worked
the graveyard
18 months steady now.

20:12.905 --> 20:14.973
I can't find a single deviation.

20:14.974 --> 20:17.342
Why did you switch your shift
on the 14th, Mr. Stinson?

20:20.779 --> 20:23.815
- Drugs.
- LOWRY: I'm sorry?

20:23.816 --> 20:25.850
Doc's got me on some
new prescription,

20:25.851 --> 20:28.987
on account of my social anxiety.

20:28.988 --> 20:31.089
It's been messing with
my sleep schedule.

20:31.090 --> 20:34.659
And the new Harley Softail
we found parked at your
mother's house?

20:34.660 --> 20:36.628
Doctor prescribed that as well?

20:36.629 --> 20:38.997
How much those retail for,
20-22?

20:38.998 --> 20:43.267
That's a huge chunk out of
a 35-a-year government salary,
don't you think?

20:43.268 --> 20:46.270
We spoke to the dealer,
he said you paid cash.

20:46.271 --> 20:48.640
I don't know anything about that.

20:48.641 --> 20:52.043
Well, lucky for us,
the bank hadn't re-circulated
the company's deposit yet,

20:52.044 --> 20:54.580
so we got to find out
all about it for you.

20:55.614 --> 20:57.815
Ran the serial numbers
against our database,

20:57.816 --> 21:01.753
and it turns out a portion of
that cash was delivered to
the Los Almos Muerto,

21:01.754 --> 21:05.890
in a local PD sting operation
two months ago.

21:05.891 --> 21:09.094
The cash you spent on the bike
was marked, Alan.

21:10.496 --> 21:13.164
This case is what we call
a slam dunk.

21:13.165 --> 21:15.233
Only thing that can help you now

21:15.234 --> 21:17.603
is if give up the people
who paid you off.

21:21.440 --> 21:25.410
- I want a lawyer.
- HARPER: Believe me,
you're gonna need one.

21:25.411 --> 21:29.514
I'd imagine that's not
your biggest concern
at the moment.

21:29.515 --> 21:32.784
See, if the cartel finds out
you've been arrested,

21:32.785 --> 21:34.852
exactly how long
do you think it'll be before

21:34.853 --> 21:37.455
they decide to
tie up that loose end?

21:37.456 --> 21:40.091
LOWRY: If you cooperate,
we can protect you.

21:40.092 --> 21:43.261
You mean, like you protected
your witness?

21:43.262 --> 21:46.664
HARPER: Conspiracy murder
is a capital crime.

21:46.665 --> 21:51.636
They'll lock you up
right alongside the inmates
you've been guarding.

21:51.637 --> 21:54.397
LOWRY: Know what,
we're gonna let you
mull that over for a minute,

21:54.907 --> 21:56.608
while you wait for your lawyer.

22:06.185 --> 22:08.086
HARPER:
Knock when you're ready.

22:08.087 --> 22:09.788
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:36.181 --> 22:38.983
Go to Gate Taxi's website,
go to the directory.

22:38.984 --> 22:41.353
And find out who's driving cab 56.

22:41.854 --> 22:43.655
JENNIFER: 56, all right.

22:44.123 --> 22:45.957
Here we go,

22:45.958 --> 22:48.893
Ali Zaid.
Chicago city taxi driver.
Born in Iraq.

22:48.894 --> 22:51.262
American citizen since 2009.

22:51.263 --> 22:56.033
There's a blog here,
some sort of
Iraq war retrospective.

22:56.034 --> 22:57.969
Are you going to talk to him, or...

22:57.970 --> 23:00.605
No, I'm going to follow him,
see where he takes it.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.088
Get the fuck outta the way!

23:17.089 --> 23:18.423
Go, move!

23:22.561 --> 23:24.395
So, that thing about
the serial numbers...

23:24.396 --> 23:26.898
- It's bullshit.
- (CHUCKLES)

23:26.899 --> 23:29.300
So how long do you think he'll take?

23:29.301 --> 23:31.569
I don't know.
This guy's in
way over his head.

23:31.570 --> 23:34.472
Another 20 minutes,
I'll have him copping to
the Kennedy Assassination.

23:39.611 --> 23:41.479
Get me something!

23:41.480 --> 23:44.782
Scissors!
I need scissors or a knife!
It's an emergency...

23:44.783 --> 23:46.585
Okay, thank you.

- Where to, boss?
- 6820 Michigan.

25:12.971 --> 25:16.041
IAD will be down tomorrow,
take some statements.

25:17.542 --> 25:18.776
You okay?

25:18.777 --> 25:21.113
Yeah... Wonderful.

25:22.581 --> 25:25.316
You know, I've been doing this
for a long time.

25:25.317 --> 25:28.085
I never seen anything
like that before in my life.

25:28.086 --> 25:29.620
I shouldn't have
leaned on him so hard.

25:29.621 --> 25:32.924
No, no. It's what we do.

25:32.925 --> 25:36.994
Ain't nothing out of
the ordinary here. That's just
some bad luck, is all.

25:36.995 --> 25:40.331
Every time I get close
on this case,
there's something else,

25:40.332 --> 25:42.800
like the gods are conspiring.

25:42.801 --> 25:44.669
- Setbacks are gonna happen.
- I know.

25:44.670 --> 25:47.204
There's no doubt.

But Marty Stein is
gonna get what he deserves.

- Because the good guys
always win, right?
-(CHUCKLES)

25:53.612 --> 25:56.247
Yeah, well, now who's the cynic?

25:56.248 --> 25:58.049
Just got a call from Judge Frey.

25:58.050 --> 26:02.119
Marty Stein's made a motion
to exclude the audio recording
from evidence.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.757
- Of course.
- Judge wants us in chambers.
We should head over now.

26:08.493 --> 26:09.828
Come on.

26:11.897 --> 26:13.165

- Hey.

26:31.283 --> 26:33.451
It's so good to see you!

26:34.553 --> 26:36.787
Look, I'm sorry.

26:36.788 --> 26:39.256
I'm sorry that I wasn't here
to help you with all this.

26:39.257 --> 26:42.293
Oh, stop that,
this was not your fault.

26:42.294 --> 26:45.563
Now, are you hungry?

26:45.564 --> 26:47.865
I haven't eaten in a week,
my nerves are shot.

26:47.866 --> 26:50.468
Actually, I can't really
stay that long, but I...

26:50.469 --> 26:52.829
But there's something that
I want to talk to you about.

27:03.215 --> 27:06.084
Something...
Something I gotta tell you.

27:10.122 --> 27:12.290
You know, the day that...

27:14.326 --> 27:16.061
That Talia died...

27:18.230 --> 27:21.665
Marty came over here looking for me.

27:21.666 --> 27:23.634
Talia turned on me to the Feds.

27:23.635 --> 27:25.936
No. Talia would never.

27:25.937 --> 27:30.708
Marty was trying to stop me
from walking into a trap.

27:30.709 --> 27:34.412
The two of 'em got into it,
started fighting...

27:35.781 --> 27:37.081
And then he killed her.

27:37.082 --> 27:38.983
No, I don't believe that.

27:38.984 --> 27:43.088
Then why do you think that
the prosecutor dropped
the charges on me, Aunt Ruth?

27:44.056 --> 27:46.157
Now, he's gonna pay.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.562
And you're the one to do it?

27:51.563 --> 27:54.465
I always wondered
about retribution.
Who does it serve?

27:54.466 --> 27:56.033
It's gonna serve Talia.

27:56.034 --> 27:58.636
No, Marlon.
That's not how it works.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.505
That doesn't serve Talia.
It doesn't serve me.

28:01.506 --> 28:03.474
The only person it serves is you.

28:03.475 --> 28:05.810
- Mmm.
- And that's selfish.
Plain and simple.

28:05.811 --> 28:07.378
Okay, so...

28:07.379 --> 28:08.746
You want that to go unanswered?

28:08.747 --> 28:10.648
That's not what I'm saying.

28:10.649 --> 28:13.050
We're far past the days
of me telling you what to do.

28:13.051 --> 28:15.086
But call it what it is.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.491
Auntie, Talia's not here no more.

28:20.492 --> 28:23.627
Then it's a lot easier for her.

28:23.628 --> 28:27.332
Now, I lost my niece,
and I'm not gonna lose you.

28:30.202 --> 28:31.902
You're not losing me.

28:31.903 --> 28:34.673
Nothing good is gonna
come from this.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.077

Don't you think our family's
been through enough?

29:03.135 --> 29:05.537
Turned into a beautiful day,
hasn't it?

29:07.606 --> 29:10.474
- How's your day going?
- Good. You?

29:10.475 --> 29:15.346
- Busy, you know.
- Yes. Yes. Of course.

29:15.347 --> 29:18.107
You know, I was wondering
if you could help me out
with something.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.117
Okay.

29:20.118 --> 29:23.688
I'm looking for
a friend of mine,
and I think she's in trouble.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.992
You should call the police.

29:27.993 --> 29:31.696
I don't think Ms. Rochlane
would appreciate that, Ali.

make trouble for her.

a package at the post office?

30:10.135 --> 30:12.002
Answer my fucking question.

30:12.003 --> 30:13.337
How did you know?

30:13.338 --> 30:15.272
- They call me.
- Who?

30:15.273 --> 30:18.075
They just ask me to
pick up the mail once
or twice a week, that's it.

- Fuck you!

30:55.614 --> 30:57.549
- MARTY: Where...
- (THUDDING)

31:00.552 --> 31:05.022
I'm sorry, that's it?
That's what everyone's
getting so excited about?

31:05.023 --> 31:07.157
I don't know
how you feel, Mr. Stein,

31:07.158 --> 31:10.261
but folks around here seem to
take the murder of a federal
witness pretty seriously.

31:10.262 --> 31:12.463
First of all, that's not me
on the recording.

31:12.464 --> 31:15.866
Second of all,
even if that was me,
this whole thing

31:15.867 --> 31:19.436
is a misappropriation
of the wiretap statute!

31:19.437 --> 31:21.905
Please, it's incidental.
The aunt's house was
well within

31:21.906 --> 31:23.807
the constraints of the warrant.

31:23.808 --> 31:28.245
- A warrant which does not
name me as the target.
- That's what incidental means.

31:28.246 --> 31:32.583
Ms. Freeman commonly had
conversations with Mr. Dinard
at their aunt's house,

31:32.584 --> 31:34.652
thus the inclusion of that location.

31:34.653 --> 31:39.556
The location is
inconsequential, the recording
was too attenuated from,

31:39.557 --> 31:42.826
not even related to,
the intended purpose
of the warrant,

31:42.827 --> 31:48.132
which was namely to set up
and execute a sting operation
on Ms. Freeman's brother.

31:48.133 --> 31:51.201
A conspiracy which we believe
Mr. Stein also
played a part in.

31:51.202 --> 31:55.039
Well, lucky for me this court
doesn't indict based on your
personal agenda.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.742
Bottom line, Judge,
Mr. Stein had no
expectation of privacy

31:58.743 --> 32:01.312
when he entered the
residence of his own volition.

32:01.313 --> 32:04.081
To discuss a privileged matter
between a lawyer
and his client,

32:04.082 --> 32:07.818
which was the relationship
Ms. Freeman and I shared
at the time.

32:07.819 --> 32:09.820
You caved her head in.

32:09.821 --> 32:12.990
Oh, my God. Can we please
stop with these
wild speculations?

32:12.991 --> 32:15.559
Unfortunately, the courts
are less consistent

32:15.560 --> 32:18.796
in the matter of
third-party wiretapping.

32:18.797 --> 32:22.299
So I'm inclined to air
on the side of caution.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.201
The recording is inadmissible.

32:24.202 --> 32:26.303
- What?
- Judge.

32:26.304 --> 32:29.273
Then I move to have
the subsequent DNA testing
halted immediately.

32:29.274 --> 32:30.841
- Screw that!
- Now hold on...

32:30.842 --> 32:33.344
It's all fruit from
the same poisonous tree.

32:33.345 --> 32:35.779
Without the recording,
there's no way any judge,
excuse me,

32:35.780 --> 32:38.816
in their right mind,
would have signed
the DNA warrant.

32:38.817 --> 32:40.217
Judge, we're building our case.

32:40.218 --> 32:42.219
We have next-door neighbors
who heard shouting,

32:42.220 --> 32:45.356
and it's possible they can
place Mr. Stein at the scene.

32:45.357 --> 32:49.026
Well, you're welcome to bring
them in to a voice line-up
at another date.

32:49.027 --> 32:50.994
But I'm granting the injunction.

32:50.995 --> 32:53.497
You've got to be kidding.

32:53.498 --> 32:55.532
Watch it, Agent Deakins.

32:55.533 --> 33:00.771
I brought you a recording,
a goddamn recording.
And still that's not enough?

33:00.772 --> 33:03.941
What the hell kind of
backroom deal
have you two cooked up?

33:03.942 --> 33:05.843
What did you say?

33:05.844 --> 33:08.112
You heard me. Don't think
everyone doesn't know
how this office really works.

33:08.113 --> 33:11.515
Someone get her
the hell out of my sight
before I lock her up.

33:11.516 --> 33:13.084
Come on.

33:14.452 --> 33:16.020
This is not over.

33:20.859 --> 33:23.494
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:26.064 --> 33:27.865
Good day.

33:50.889 --> 33:53.458
- It's here.
- Get out.

34:00.331 --> 34:01.632
Where is she?

34:01.633 --> 34:03.667
About 600 yards that way.

34:03.668 --> 34:06.004
All right, let's go. Show me.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.958
- ETHAN:
How much further is it?
- It's close by.

34:32.964 --> 34:34.864
It's over there.

34:34.866 --> 34:38.335
All right, give me your keys
and cell phone.

34:38.335 --> 34:39.837

Now, right now.

Wait. Hold up.

What? A man can't order
a delicious drink?

37:27.772 --> 37:29.840
You know,
I was real proud of you today.

37:29.841 --> 37:32.376
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:32.377 --> 37:35.512
Was it the witness
I let hang in
my interrogation room?

37:35.513 --> 37:40.884
Or the fact that
I almost punched
a judge in the face?

37:40.885 --> 37:44.755
Oh, there's no question
you've had
a little run of bad luck.

37:46.591 --> 37:51.261
Good luck, bad luck, no such thing.

37:51.262 --> 37:53.530
Game's rigged, that's all.

37:53.531 --> 37:57.068
Of course,
that's what makes it
so much damn fun.

Come on.
Winning's easy, Deakins.

38:05.610 --> 38:08.445
Paying off judges,
collecting favors...

38:08.446 --> 38:10.248
Anybody can do what Stein does.

38:11.249 --> 38:13.651
But not a lot of people
can do what we do.

38:14.819 --> 38:16.654
What is it exactly we do?

38:17.388 --> 38:19.256
We...

38:19.257 --> 38:22.092
We get the shit kicked out of us.

38:22.093 --> 38:25.495
We work our asses off,
and nothing ever changes.

38:25.496 --> 38:28.699
We sacrifice our time,
our family, our health.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.534
We come in, day in and day out,

38:30.535 --> 38:33.504
knowing that we don't make
a lick of goddamn difference.

38:35.139 --> 38:36.807
Until one day we do.

38:39.210 --> 38:41.178
I guess I have that to
look forward to, then.

38:41.179 --> 38:45.650
No, look, I'm serious.
You can't let days like today
get to you.

bullshit speech about climbing
to the top of some ziggurat?

39:36.934 --> 39:40.203
Yeah, and I was almost
stupid enough to believe it.

39:40.204 --> 39:42.672
You haven't done so bad
for yourself since you met me.

39:42.673 --> 39:44.741
Yeah? I haven't done so bad?

She turned on you, Marlon.
She was working for the Feds.

She was trying to take you out.

39:53.417 --> 39:54.918
I know all that.

39:54.919 --> 39:57.254
I was trying to protect you.
I was trying to save you.

You wasn't trying to
protect me, man.

You always just
looking out for Marty.

I'm so sorry. I didn't want
her to ruin both of our lives.

human being I am.

you wanted her dead?

No! It was an accident!

- Bullshit.
- It was an accident!

got me for, Marty.

- To do your dirty work.
- Oh, for fucks sake!

stand around here
and listen to you
