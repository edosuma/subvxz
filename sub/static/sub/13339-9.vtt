WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.409
Hannah:
THIS IS LIKE
THE MOST "S.A.T.C."

00:09.977 --> 00:11.979
DO I KNOW THIS
MELANCHOLY PERSON?

00:12.080 --> 00:14.482
TALLY SCHIFRIN? SHE WAS
IN ALL MY WRITING CLASSES.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.085
I USED TO COMPLAIN
ABOUT WHAT AN AWFUL WRITER
AND HUMAN SHE WAS.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.053
I MEAN, WE'RE
BASICALLY NEMESES.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.955
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS SO SAD.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.592
HER BOYFRIEND KILLED
HIMSELF ON PURPOSE

00:24.692 --> 00:27.095
BY CRASHING A VINTAGE CAR
WHILE ON PERCOCET.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.997
I KNOW.
SHE'S SO LUCKY.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.232
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T LOOK AT THIS.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.868
SHE IS PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.
SHE'S FAKE.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.604
SHE'S NOT TALENTED.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.273
ALL SHE USED TO WRITE ABOUT
WERE HER SEXUAL ESCAPADES,

00:39.373 --> 00:41.409
AND THEN SHE GOT INTO
A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.411
AND SO I THOUGHT SHE'D
REVEAL HER TRUE BORING NATURE

00:43.511 --> 00:45.879
AND START WRITING TRAVELOGUES
OR SOMETHING, BUT NO--

00:45.979 --> 00:47.548
HER BOYFRIEND
UP AND KILLED HIMSELF.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.451
YOUR BOYFRIEND
SHOULD KILL HIMSELF.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.452
YOU DESERVE IT.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.053
WELL, THANK YOU.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.123
BUT YOU'RE JUST SAYING
THAT BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.624
Girl: HANNAH!

00:56.724 --> 00:58.659
HANNAH!

01:03.631 --> 01:04.465
BE RIGHT BACK.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.367
Man:
SIR, WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.469
SHE'S, LIKE,
PAINFULLY PRETTY.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.173
- HEY. HI.
- HANNAH!

01:12.273 --> 01:14.808
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
- NO, YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.378
I MEAN, I COULD NEVER
MISS THIS. IT'S SUCH A HUGE
DEAL TO FINISH A BOOK.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.480
- I JUST WANT TO CELEBRATE.
- THANK YOU.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.549
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
WHAT'S IN THE BOOK.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.118
WELL, I WISH THAT
IT HAD BEEN

01:24.218 --> 01:25.519
MORE OF A LABOR,
ACTUALLY, YEAH,

01:25.619 --> 01:28.322
BECAUSE IT JUST
REALLY POURED OUT OF ME.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.023
- OH, WOW.
- YOU KNOW, SOMEONE LIKE YOU,

01:30.124 --> 01:31.825
YOU'RE ALWAYS REALLY
SWEATING IT, YOU KNOW?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.927
YOU'RE REALLY WORKING
AT IT, AND I REALLY
ADMIRE THAT EFFORT

01:34.027 --> 01:36.063
TO DO SOMETHING
THAT IS NOT, MAYBE,

01:36.164 --> 01:38.132
THE MOST NATURAL
TO YOU.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.768
- Man: PUFF PASTRY?
- MAYBE BECAUSE IT JUST
POURED OUT OF YOU.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.303
- THANK YOU.
- IT WAS LIKE A--

01:42.403 --> 01:44.605
LIKE I WAS JUST--
LIKE I JUST WATER-BIRTHED

01:44.705 --> 01:46.006
MY TRUTH.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.575
- YOU KNOW?
- SORRY.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.743
- ( laughs ) IT'S OKAY.
- USUALLY I EAT ANYTHING,

01:49.843 --> 01:51.679
- BUT THAT WAS COLD
AND DOES NOT TASTE GOOD.
- OH, GOD.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.414
I KNOW. AND NOW
IT'S KIND OF LIKE, WHAT?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.115
YOU KNOW,
THIS PARTY IS INSANE

01:55.216 --> 01:57.351
AND I'M JUST KIND OF
EMBARRASSED BY IT.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.420
IT'S AMAZING.
I'M HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.088
- GOOD.
- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO LEAVE SOON.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.723
OH, NO.
( laughs )

02:02.823 --> 02:05.559
- ARE YOU STILL WRITING?
- I AM STILL WRITING.
YEAH, ACTUALLY.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.795
- DO YOU HAVE AN AGENT?
- I DON'T HAVE AN AGENT.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.865
NO, I MEAN, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
HE LIVES IN PROSPECT HEIGHTS.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.867
HE'S ALIVE
AND WELL THERE, SO...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969
WELL,
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.871
HOPEFULLY HE'S HETERO.
( laughs )

02:17.971 --> 02:20.774
YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S
A "NEW YORK MAGAZINE" EDITOR
WHO IS TOTALLY STALKING ME,

02:20.874 --> 02:23.043
AND IF I DON'T SAY HELLO,
SHE'S GONNA GO CRAZY.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.646
ALSO, I COMPLETELY
HAVE TO POOP.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.218
Woman Â£2:
CONGRATULATIONS, TALLY.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.720
( theme music playing )

02:34.222 --> 02:35.423
OH, MY GOD!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.358
IF I WAS STILL
IN MY EXPERIMENTAL PHASE,

02:37.458 --> 02:39.827
I WOULD JUST RIP OFF
YOUR DRESS RIGHT HERE
AND JUST GET INTO IT!

02:39.927 --> 02:42.730
THEN PEOPLE WOULD DEFINITELY
WRITE ABOUT THE PARTY.
( laughs )

02:42.830 --> 02:45.098
- Tally: I THINK
THEY STILL ARE.
- THEY STILL ARE.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.700
- HI.
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.603
I LIKE HER. SHE DOESN'T
INDULGE THE NEGATIVITY.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.072
I MEAN,
DID YOU HEAR HER
ON "FRESH AIR"?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.107
UH, THE FIRST PART.
I FELL ASLEEP.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.010
ISN'T THAT, UM...

02:57.110 --> 02:59.613
- HERE WE ARE.
- Hannah: THAT'S POWELL GOLDMAN,
MY OLD WRITING TEACHER.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.449
YEAH, YOU WERE
OBSESSED WITH HIM.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.050
I WASN'T
OBSESSED WITH HIM.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.085
YOU WERE
OBSESSED WITH HIM.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.587
HE WAS
AN AMAZING TEACHER.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.422
HE READ MY THESIS
AND HE GAVE ME

03:08.522 --> 03:11.259
THESE COMPLEX,
BRILLIANT, THOUGHTFUL NOTES

03:11.359 --> 03:12.893
- THAT WERE JUST--
- HANNAH.

03:12.993 --> 03:16.430
OH, MY GOD,
GO SAY HI. GO.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.700
- PROFESSOR GOLDMAN.
- NO, PLEASE. POWELL.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.169
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT EVEN
WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.037
- SORRY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.574
I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU SINCE, UM...

03:26.674 --> 03:28.242
IT'S PROBABLY SINCE
I'VE GRADUATED, SO--

03:28.342 --> 03:30.110
I WAS SOBBING.
I APOLOGIZE.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.280
I STILL REMEMBER
THAT ESSAY YOU WROTE,

03:32.380 --> 03:35.583
THE ONE ABOUT BEING GROUNDED
FOR WEARING SHORTS.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.952
I READ YOUR NEW NOVEL,
BY THE WAY. I AM--
I LOVED IT.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.689
THERE WAS THAT AMAZING
"TIMES" REVIEW AND I WANTED
TO WRITE YOU AN EMAIL,

03:41.789 --> 03:43.857
BUT I'M SURE YOU
PROBABLY GET ENOUGH
OF THOSE EMAILS, SO...

03:43.957 --> 03:47.194
HOT TIP, HANNAH--
NO ONE'S EVER GETTING
ENOUGH OF THOSE KIND.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.430
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE TALLY.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.632
I WANT TO BE SO SKINNY
THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKE,

03:51.732 --> 03:53.801
- "DO YOU HAVE A DISEASE?
ARE YOU GONNA DIE?"
- YEAH.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.537
YEAH. I KNOW
THIS PROBABLY SEEMS
LIKE A REALLY BIG DEAL,

03:56.637 --> 03:58.539
BUT TALLY
IS A SHITTY WRITER.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.008
THANK YOU.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.810
AND YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.712
THANK YOU.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.114
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'VE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER

04:07.214 --> 04:08.982
A WEEKLY READING
AT SALMAGUNDI ART CLUB.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.884
IT'S VERY CASUAL.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.754
IT'S TOMORROW NIGHT.
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME
READ SOMETHING.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.489
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.257
OKAY. I KNOW A READING
PROBABLY SOUNDS VERY
ARCHAIC TO YOU,

04:18.358 --> 04:21.094
BUT IT ALWAYS HELPS ME
TO HEAR MY STUFF READ ALOUD.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.631
NO, I KNOW IT'S
A GOOD THING TO DO,

04:23.731 --> 04:25.666
IT'S JUST NOT REALLY,
LIKE, A VERY "ME"
THING TO DO.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.969
WELL, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT A "HANNAH" THING
TO DO WOULD BE.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.477
- ( Adam snoring )
- ( police siren blaring )

04:39.847 --> 04:41.482
( music playing )

04:56.897 --> 04:59.099
Marnie:
SO YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
AT ALL LAST NIGHT?

04:59.199 --> 05:01.435
NO, I LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT

05:01.535 --> 05:03.371
THINKING ABOUT HOW I WAS
SUCH A FREAKISH BITCH

05:03.471 --> 05:05.339
ABOUT TALLY
AT HER BOOK PARTY.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.075
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY TRIED
TO TRIP HER AT ONE POINT.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.044
YOU KNOW, AND THEN
I REALIZED OF COURSE
I'M NOT MAD AT HER.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.181
- I'M MAD AT ME.
- WHAT FOR?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.849
FOR THE FACT
THAT MY ENTIRE LIFE

05:15.949 --> 05:18.185
HAS BEEN ONE RIDICULOUS
MISTAKE AFTER ANOTHER.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.588
I MEAN, DID I EVER
TELL YOU, MARNIE,

05:20.688 --> 05:22.690
THAT I WENT TO THE STUPIDEST,
STUPIDEST SUMMER CAMP?

05:22.790 --> 05:25.693
- NO.
- WELL, I DID.
YOU KNOW?

05:25.793 --> 05:28.762
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE DID THERE.
WE NEVER PUT ON SHOWS.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.731
WE NEVER TOOK HIKES.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.401
I MEAN, YOU COULD SIGN UP
TO WATER-SKI, BUT I NEVER
SIGNED UP TO WATER-SKI

05:33.501 --> 05:35.268
AND NOW I'LL PROBABLY
NEVER WATER-SKI.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.104
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH TALLY SCHIFRIN?

05:37.204 --> 05:39.740
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT
THAT TALLY SCHIFRIN
TOOK CHANCES.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.510
SHE WORE
LIPSTICK TO CLASS.
SHE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT...

05:42.610 --> 05:45.145
INCLUDING GET HER BOYFRIEND
TO KILL HIMSELF.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.448
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A CHANCE
AND I'M GONNA PUT
MYSELF OUT THERE

05:47.548 --> 05:49.349
AND I AM GOING
TO DO THE READING.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.951
( door opens )

05:51.051 --> 05:53.554
( Adam beatboxing )

05:58.492 --> 06:01.695
( groans,
resumes beatboxing )

06:04.364 --> 06:07.735
( door closes, opens )

06:07.835 --> 06:10.270
ALL RIGHT. DON'T COME IN
FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.440
( resumes beatboxing )

06:14.241 --> 06:16.444
DID YOU GIVE HIM
A KEY TO OUR
APARTMENT?

06:16.544 --> 06:19.179
HE'S USING MINE.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.615
( music playing )

06:25.553 --> 06:28.355
POWELL GOLDMAN SEEMED REALLY
FOCUSED ON YOU LAST NIGHT.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.425
- IT'S A THING.
- LIKE IN A MENTOR WAY.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.393
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.295
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST,
I THINK HE'S THE KIND OF GUY

06:35.395 --> 06:37.197
I'VE ALWAYS PICTURED YOU
BEING WITH.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.366
MARNIE, HE WOULDN'T.
TALLY TRIED--

06:39.467 --> 06:43.737
- ( glass shatters )
- OH, FUCK!

06:43.837 --> 06:46.173
I THINK I'M GONNA
READ THE STORY ABOUT
PHIL THE HOARDER.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.042
OH. THAT ONE?

06:49.142 --> 06:52.045
YEAH, THAT ONE.
I JUST EMAILED IT TO POWELL.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.214
WHY DID YOU SAY IT
LIKE THAT?

06:54.314 --> 06:56.316
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.953
UM, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT,
LIKE, WHINEY.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.489
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.557
LIKE IF HE WAS THAT RUDE
AND IT SMELLED THAT BAD,

07:03.657 --> 07:05.392
COULDN'T YOU JUST LEAVE?

07:05.493 --> 07:08.361
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE
A LITTLE MORE SUPPORTIVE.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.897
WAIT, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.264
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.967
HANNAH, I SUPPORT YOU,
LITERALLY.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.237
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU OWE ME
AT THIS POINT?

07:17.337 --> 07:19.907
OF COURSE I DO,
AND THAT'S WHY I TOOK
A TRIAL SHIFT AT GRUMPY'S.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.975
SOON I'LL BE ABLE
TO START PAYING YOU BACK.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.577
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.615
THANK YOU.
OKAY?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.384
THANK YOU.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.587
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:35.856 --> 07:39.059
WE WERE THERE LAST NIGHT
AT THE CENTER
OF EVERYTHING.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.928
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

07:41.028 --> 07:43.263
YEAH.
I CAN, ACTUALLY.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.265
( car horn honking )

07:45.365 --> 07:47.701
THE PARAGRAPH THAT
I READ IN TALLY'S BOOK
REALLY MADE ME THINK.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.003
REALLY? I SHOULD READ
THAT PARAGRAPH.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.506
"NONE OF US KNOW HOW MUCH
TIME WE HAVE LEFT."

07:52.606 --> 07:54.575
MM, ACTUALLY, I DO.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.510
WHEN I WAS
THREE YEARS OLD,

07:56.610 --> 07:58.411
MY MOTHER'S PSYCHIC, DEMETRI,
SHE PICKED ME UP,

07:58.512 --> 08:02.115
KISSED ME ON MY BOTTOM,
AND TOLD ME I WAS GOING
TO LIVE UNTIL 105.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.417
OH. OKAY, WELL,

08:04.518 --> 08:05.819
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
TIME I HAVE LEFT,

08:05.919 --> 08:07.487
SO, LIKE, I HAVE TO
START LIVING, YOU KNOW?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.890
I DID SOMETHING
KIND OF CRAZY.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.759
I MADE AN INTERNET
DATING PROFILE.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.827
OKAY, I KNOW IT
SOUNDS KIND OF NUTS,

08:13.927 --> 08:16.229
BUT MY NUTRITION TEACHER,
WHO'S, LIKE, SO COOL,

08:16.329 --> 08:19.533
MET HER BOYFRIEND ON MATCH.COM
WHO'S LIKE SUPER CUTE
AND TOTALLY PERF

08:19.633 --> 08:21.368
AND THEY'RE LIKE
THE MOST HAPPY TOGETHER.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.537
AND I JOINED
ELECTRICHELLOS.COM

08:23.637 --> 08:25.438
BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST
EXPENSIVE SUBSCRIPTION

08:25.539 --> 08:27.174
AND UGLY PEOPLE DO MATCH,
AND I GOT THIS MESSAGE

08:27.274 --> 08:29.309
FROM THIS, LIKE, KIND OF
GREAT-SOUNDING GUY.

08:29.409 --> 08:32.179
HIS NAME IS BRICE, WHICH,
LIKE-- UM, HELLO. GOOD NAME.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.715
HE WORKS IN PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS,
LIKE, PERFECT FOR ME

08:34.815 --> 08:36.950
BECAUSE I LOVE PRODUCTS,
AND HE'S JEWISH.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.518
HE IS JEWISH.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.352
HE LIKES MOVIES
AND FOOD.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.722
WE'RE GOING ON A WALK
THIS AFTERNOON TO A COUPLE
OF GALLERIES.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.191
WE'RE STARTING
IN A PUBLIC PLACE,

08:44.291 --> 08:45.993
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT IN CASE

08:46.093 --> 08:48.095
- THEY TRY AND RAPE YOU.
- RIGHT.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.764
SO I'M MEETING HIM AT
THE CAFE AT THE OLD NAVY
FLAGSHIP STORE.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.734
I'M GOING ON A DAY DATE.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.704
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
THIS AFTERNOON?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.806
I NEED TO MAKE
SOME CHANGES.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.209
- MM-HMM.
- SO I'M THINKING OF
STARTING WITH OUR HOME.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.012
OH, LIKE, WITH--
WITHOUT ME?

09:05.112 --> 09:08.281
YEAH, OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.618
( panting )

09:12.085 --> 09:13.654
HEY, LITTLE FACE.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.823
OKAY, SO I CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT THIS READING
TONIGHT,

09:15.923 --> 09:17.858
AND I'M GOING TO DO IT,
SO YOU WANNA COME?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.326
NO.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.929
OKAY, I MEAN, IT'LL JUST BE US
MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.397
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE--
- SORRY, KID. READINGS
ARE BULLSHIT.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.034
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A READING
WHERE I DIDN'T WANT TO STRANGLE
THE FUCKING PERSON READING.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.436
PLUS, THEY HAVE
THOSE STUPID FUCKING
LITTLE CRACKERS

09:29.536 --> 09:31.438
THAT ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE COOKIES, BUT ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE CRACKERS.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.340
THERE'S NO FUCKING MEAT.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.876
IF IT HAD FUCKING MEAT,
I WOULD EAT THAT SHIT,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.512
PLUS EVERYONE'S DRUNK
AND ACT LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE
TO SAY IS SOMEHOW STILL VALID.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.249
AND I ACTUALLY
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.151
THEN WHY DO IT?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.553
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SOMETIMES
YOU WANT TO, LIKE, GET
TO SOMEPLACE NEW,

09:46.654 --> 09:48.856
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY
YOU'RE DOING THINGS.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.924
SOMEPLACE NEW?
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.762
CAN YOU SIT ON MY BACK?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.564
- JUST RIGHT HERE OR...
- LIKE I SHOWED YOU.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.598
- OKAY.
- HERE, LET ME GET DOWN.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.667
- OW.
- OH, FUCKER!

09:59.767 --> 10:00.668
- SORRY.
- ( grunts )

10:00.768 --> 10:03.070
( music playing )

10:04.738 --> 10:06.273
( knocks on door )

10:06.373 --> 10:08.275
COME IN.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.443
( door opens )

10:10.543 --> 10:12.212
( door closes )

10:15.315 --> 10:16.717
HI.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.986
KATHERINE.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.529
THIS IS A STRANGE SITUATION.
( laughs )

10:29.629 --> 10:32.666
BUT NOW, NOW THAT I'VE HAD
A CHANCE TO PROCESS
MY EMOTION,

10:32.766 --> 10:35.435
I CAN JUST SAY
FUCK JEFF

10:35.535 --> 10:37.104
AND HIS PENIS.

10:37.204 --> 10:40.273
YOU KNOW? I NEED YOU
AND MY GIRLS NEED YOU.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.144
JESSA, I WANT
YOU TO COME BACK.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.387
MORNING, RAY.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.156
- I AM REALLY EXCITED--
- DID YOU BRING OTHER
CLOTHES WITH YOU?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.093
- NO.
- YOU HAVE TO GO HOME
AND CHANGE.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.663
IS THERE LIKE A DRESS CODE
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT OR IS--

11:03.764 --> 11:05.966
HANNAH, YOU'RE WEARING
A WHITE DRESS. OKAY?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.535
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY BEGGING
THE WORLD TO FUCK WITH YOU.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.004
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
YOU'RE DARING A
HOMELESS PERSON

11:11.104 --> 11:12.906
TO WIPE THEIR BLOOD
ON YOUR BREASTS.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.307
WELL, WE WEAR APRONS,
DON'T WE?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.343
THIS ISN'T A CONSUMPTIVE
WOMEN'S HOSPITAL.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.011
WE DON'T WEAR APRONS.
NO.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.047
OKAY? FORGET ALL THE BBC
YOU WATCH AT HOME
WITH YOUR CATS

11:20.147 --> 11:21.882
AND PICK OUT
AN APPROPRIATE OUTFIT.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.722
AND DON'T DO SOME SHIT
WHERE YOU COME BACK WEARING
GRAY FLANNEL SWEATPANTS

11:28.822 --> 11:31.258
AND A TAYLOR SWIFT T-SHIRT
TO BE A DICK. OKAY?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.160
I KNOW ALL THE DICK MOVES.
DON'T BE A DICK.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.796
OKAY? JUST A NICE, UH--
A NICE CUTE TOP.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.198
- A CUTE TOP?
- YEAH, A CUTE TOP.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.233
STOP BY AT AMERICAN APPAREL
IF YOU HAVE TO.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.302
AND GET A SLIM LEG.
JEANS WITH A SLIM LEG.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.306
- OKAY.
- I WANT YOU BACK IN AN HOUR.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.941
SLIM LEG. OKAY?
SLIM LEG.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.177
( car horn honking )

11:53.146 --> 11:56.149
I'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT
OF DREAMS ABOUT YOU.
( laughs nervously )

11:56.249 --> 11:58.118
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.686
LIKE WHAT KIND?

11:59.787 --> 12:02.589
ONES WHERE I STAB YOU...

12:02.689 --> 12:04.124
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.760
IS THERE, LIKE,
JUST BLOOD GUSHING?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.429
YES. I REMEMBER
I TRY TO CUT YOUR BODY

12:09.529 --> 12:11.498
INTO AS MANY
LITTLE PIECES AS I CAN

12:11.598 --> 12:15.368
AND THEN I--
I START TO EAT YOU.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.938
I START TO EAT YOUR BODY.
AND THEN ACROSS THE ROOM,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.239
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MY DAUGHTERS ARE THERE.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.774
THEY'RE PLAYING
CHINESE JUMP ROPE.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.110
MY MOTHER IS
BREAST-FEEDING JEFF.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.945
THEY ALL TURN
TO LOOK AT ME

12:25.045 --> 12:28.115
AND THEN
I SHIT YOU OUT.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.183
OH.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.285
BUT NOT ALL OF YOU.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.455
AND SO I THINK
THIS MEANS

12:35.555 --> 12:37.858
I'M STILL HOLDING
ONTO SOME ANGER.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.293
- YEAH.
- ( sighs )

12:40.393 --> 12:41.795
ON THE OTHER HAND,

12:41.895 --> 12:44.364
I WANTED TO THANK YOU,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.001
'CAUSE I-- I THINK
YOU MADE ME SEE SOME THINGS

12:48.101 --> 12:51.004
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE
THAT I'D BEEN IGNORING.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.541
AND YOU STOPPED
THE SITUATION BEFORE
ANYTHING HAPPENED, SO...

12:54.641 --> 12:57.310
DOES NO-- NOTHING
DID HAPPEN, RIGHT?

12:57.410 --> 13:00.047
NO. I WAS-- I WAS ONLY
ATTRACTED TO HIM FOR LIKE

13:00.147 --> 13:03.851
- SEVERAL MINUTES
WHEN I FIRST MET HIM.
- OKAY.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.219
BUT I'M ATTRACTED TO EVERYONE
WHEN I FIRST MEET THEM,

13:06.319 --> 13:09.957
AND THEN IT WORE OFF.
IT ALWAYS WEARS OFF.

13:10.057 --> 13:13.160
YOU SHOULD TRY SUSTAINING
THAT FOR 15 YEARS.
( chuckles )

13:15.162 --> 13:16.830
SO YOU REMEMBER I HAVE
THIS READING LATER, OKAY?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.966
- SO I HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY?
- MM-HMM.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.468
WHAT'S YOUR POEM ABOUT?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.936
IT'S NOT A POEM.
IT'S AN ESSAY.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.539
- AND IT'S ABOUT ME.
- OOH, SHOCKER.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.674
WELL, I WRITE
PERSONAL ESSAYS,

13:27.774 --> 13:28.909
SO THEY KIND OF
HAVE TO BE ABOUT ME.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.743
AND THIS ONE IS ABOUT
THIS TIME IN COLLEGE

13:30.844 --> 13:32.245
WHEN I HAD
A CRUSH ON THIS GUY.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.082
TURNS OUT HE'S A HOARDER.
I SLEPT IN HIS DORM ROOM

13:35.182 --> 13:38.085
ON TOP OF A PILE OF COLLAPSED
CHINESE FOOD BOXES, LIKE,
A SEMESTER'S WORTH.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.320
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT SOUNDS
REALLY TRIVIAL TO YOU.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.255
IT'S DEFINITELY
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.324
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE SUPER SERIOUS,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.526
BUT IT'S ALSO SUPPOSED
TO TAKE ON BIGGER ISSUES,
LIKE FEAR OF INTIMACY--

13:46.626 --> 13:49.429
WHAT IN THE WORLD
COULD BE MORE TRIVIAL
THAN INTIMACY?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.732
HMM? IS THERE ANYTHING REAL
YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.903
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD BE A REAL THING
TO WRITE ABOUT?

13:56.003 --> 13:57.470
I DON'T KNOW.
LOTS OF THINGS.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.906
CULTURAL CRITICISM.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.608
HOW ABOUT YEARS
OF NEGLECTED ABUSE?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.043
HOW ABOUT ACID RAIN?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.045
HOW ABOUT THE PLIGHT
OF THE GIANT PANDA BEAR?

14:05.145 --> 14:08.248
HOW ABOUT RACIAL PROFILING?
HOW ABOUT URBAN SPRAWL?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.984
HOW ABOUT DIVORCE?
HOW ABOUT DEATH?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.320
HOW ABOUT DEATH?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.555
DEATH IS THE MOST REAL.
YOU SHOULD WRITE ABOUT DEATH.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.024
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SHOULD WRITE ABOUT.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.961
EXPLORE THAT.
DEATH.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.297
UM, KATHERINE,
I, UM--

14:24.397 --> 14:27.700
I CAN'T COME BACK
TO WORK FOR YOU.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.070
YOU KNOW THAT.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.939
I DO.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.875
THIS IS SO CRAZY.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.345
I FEEL LIKE
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.613
LIKE, I WANT TO BE YOUR MOTHER,
WHICH IS INSANE,

14:40.713 --> 14:43.716
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD BE YOUR MOTHER.
( laughs )

14:43.816 --> 14:46.920
BABIES HAVING BABIES.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.589
BUT, UM...
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.128
FUCK IT.
I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.633
I BET YOU GET INTO
THESE DRAMAS ALL THE TIME,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.369
LIKE WITH JEFF AND ME...

15:02.469 --> 15:05.505
WHERE YOU CAUSE
ALL THIS TROUBLE
AND YOU'VE NO IDEA WHY.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.643
IN MY OPINION...

15:10.743 --> 15:12.179
YOU'RE DOING IT
TO DISTRACT YOURSELF

15:12.279 --> 15:15.415
FROM BECOMING THE PERSON
YOU'RE MEANT TO BE.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.252
WHICH IS WHO?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.622
YOU TELL ME.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.224
SHE MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE

15:24.324 --> 15:27.494
WHAT YOU PICTURED
WHEN YOU WERE AGE 16.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.497
HER JOB MIGHT NOT BE COOL.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.666
HER HAIR MIGHT NOT
BE FLOWING LIKE A MERMAID.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.605
AND SHE MIGHT REALLY BE SERIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING...

15:40.373 --> 15:42.742
OR SOMEONE.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.979
AND SHE MIGHT BE A LOT
HAPPIER THAN YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.251
Woman:
"IT WAS A SIGHT
TO MAKE YOU CRINGE,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.220
TO MAKE YOU QUESTION
YOUR OWN MORAL FIBER

15:53.320 --> 15:55.888
AND FEAR FOR YOUR
OWN SHAMEFUL TRUTH.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.790
I COVERED MY EYES..."

15:57.890 --> 15:59.159
- HEY.
- HI.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.294
- YOU MADE IT.
- YEAH, SORRY.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.997
I WOULD HAVE WRITTEN YOU OFF,
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
YOUR STYLE--

16:04.097 --> 16:05.365
SHOWING UP
ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATE

16:05.465 --> 16:08.068
AND THEN APOLOGIZING SO MUCH
I COULDN'T FAULT YOU.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.104
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- THERE YOU GO.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.839
"AND THAT'S
WHEN ELI REALIZED

16:12.939 --> 16:14.374
MAYBE EVERYONE
IN THIS TOWN

16:14.474 --> 16:16.276
IS JUST LOOKING
FOR A BATHROOM.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.378
'IN FACT,'
HE THOUGHT,

16:18.478 --> 16:21.714
'MAYBE EVERYONE IN
THIS WHOLE DAMN WORLD IS.'"

16:22.915 --> 16:24.484
THANK YOU.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.429
HI.
UM, I AM HANNAH HORVATH.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.398
UM, I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO SAY OUR NAMES,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.000
BUT I DID, SO YOU CAN
ALL DEAL WITH IT.
( laughs )

16:41.101 --> 16:43.503
UM, I WAS GONNA
READ AN ESSAY

16:43.603 --> 16:45.638
THAT I WROTE ABOUT A GUY
WHO I KNEW IN COLLEGE

16:45.738 --> 16:48.541
WHO I HAD A CRUSH ON
AND THEN HE TURNED OUT
TO BE A HOARDER.

16:48.641 --> 16:52.245
UM, WHICH HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
A HOARDER, BUT HE WAS,
IN FACT, A HOARDER.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.914
UH, BUT I REREAD
THE ESSAY THIS MORNING

16:55.014 --> 16:58.385
AND IT ACTUALLY SEEMED
REALLY STUPID, SO, UM,

16:58.485 --> 17:00.587
I WROTE SOMETHING NEW
ON THE SUBWAY ON THE WAY HERE,

17:00.687 --> 17:03.390
WHICH MAKES IT SOUND LIKE
I DIDN'T PUT A LOT
OF WORK INTO IT,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.592
BUT I DID BECAUSE WE WERE
STOPPED AT CANAL STREET

17:05.692 --> 17:08.127
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.433
OKAY.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.502
"I MET IGOR ONLINE

17:15.602 --> 17:18.238
IN A CHAT ROOM FOR FANS
OF AN OBSCURE PUNK BAND

17:18.338 --> 17:20.272
MY VEGAN FRIEND,
MARINA, LIKED.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.943
IGOR'S SCREEN NAME
WAS "PYRO000,"

17:24.042 --> 17:26.313
WHICH BELIED A LEVEL
OF ARTICULATION

17:26.413 --> 17:29.015
UNUSUAL FOR
AN INTERNET BOYFRIEND.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.251
SO HE BECAME
MY INTERNET BOYFRIEND

17:31.351 --> 17:33.253
FOR SIX BLISSFUL MONTHS,

17:33.353 --> 17:37.190
UNTIL HIS FRIEND IM'd ME
TO SAY THAT HE HAD DIED.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.198
DIED."

17:45.298 --> 17:46.999
I REALLY ENJOYED
YOUR PIECE, SARAH.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.435
OH, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.670
YOUR GRANDDAD
AS BOTH A RENEGADE
AND A GENTLEMAN.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.107
- I AM SO GLAD
THAT CAME THROUGH.
- ABSOLUTELY.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.176
Woman:
AH, EXCUSE ME.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.412
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU.
I REALLY LIKED YOUR PIECE.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.747
OH, THANK YOU.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.516
- YEAH, BUT I HAVE
A QUESTION.
- MM-HMM?

18:03.616 --> 18:06.419
YOU KNOW THE MAN WHO'S ON
"TO CATCH A PREDATOR"?

18:06.519 --> 18:09.589
WELL, OCCASIONALLY,
HE BAITS PEOPLE
WHO CALL IN,

18:09.689 --> 18:12.525
PEOPLE WHO ARE LONELY
OR AUTISTIC.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.927
YOU KNOW, THEY ONLY
GO ON THE INTERNET

18:15.027 --> 18:16.963
FOR COMPANY
OR TO LEARN SOMETHING.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.998
I THINK THAT'S VERY WRONG

18:19.098 --> 18:21.301
AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.105
THAT'S NOT REALLY
A QUESTION.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.141
I THINK IT IS.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.478
HENRY!

18:32.779 --> 18:35.081
- HEY.
- HI.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.016
THAT WAS INTERESTING.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.618
NO, IT WASN'T.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.421
WELL, TO BE HONEST,
IT REALLY DIDN'T COME
TOGETHER FOR ME.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.290
WHICH MAKES SENSE,
CONSIDERING I
HEARD A RUMOR

18:43.390 --> 18:44.857
THAT YOU WROTE IT
ON THE SUBWAY.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.262
- I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THE READING.
- WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE

18:49.362 --> 18:50.930
WAS READ THAT
HYSTERICAL PIECE
YOU SENT ME,

18:51.030 --> 18:53.366
THE ONE ABOUT
THE GUY WITH THE ROOM
FULL OF GARBAGE.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.503
THAT WAS GREAT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
READ THAT ONE?

18:58.104 --> 19:00.207
BECAUSE IT WAS TRIVIAL,

19:00.307 --> 19:04.911
AND NOW I SEEM TRIVIAL
EVEN MORE SO, SO...

19:07.079 --> 19:08.281
THANK YOU.
I'M REALLY SORRY, OKAY?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.750
- BYE, POWELL.
- HEY.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.254
HANNAH.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.723
( music playing )

19:34.474 --> 19:37.043
WAIT, SO YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT
TALLY SCHIFRIN'S BOOK?

19:37.143 --> 19:39.078
IT WAS A BOOK PARTY,
SO I BOUGHT THE BOOK.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.349
WELL, YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, DO YOU?

19:42.449 --> 19:44.751
SHE'S A REALLY
GOOD WRITER. YOU KNOW?
SHE CAPTURES SOMETHING

19:44.851 --> 19:48.455
REALLY TRUE ABOUT
THE UNCERTAINTY OF BEING
OUR AGE. I CRIED TWICE.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.357
WELL, ARE YOU
GETTING YOUR PERIOD?

19:50.457 --> 19:52.825
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT.
SO...

19:53.993 --> 19:55.395
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:55.495 --> 19:57.230
JUST THROWING OUT
SOME OLD CLOTHING

19:57.330 --> 19:59.532
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO GET RID OF FOR
A LONG TIME.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.468
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE IT TO CHARITY.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.503
I DON'T THINK POOR PEOPLE
NEED TO WEAR MY SHITTY
OLD STUFF

20:03.603 --> 20:06.639
- ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE.
- WELL, I LOVE THAT DRESS.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.675
- THIS ONE?
- YEAH, I LOVE IT.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.510
- REALLY?
- DON'T THROW THAT AWAY,
IT'S GREAT.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.812
YOU CAN HAVE IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SIZE IT IS, THOUGH.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.681
MIGHT BE TIGHT.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.882
OKAY.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.952
MARNIE, I DID THE STUPIDEST
THING AT THAT READING.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.588
I'M KIND OF DOING THIS
RIGHT NOW.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.524
- COULD WE TALK
ABOUT IT LATER?
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.960
- ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
- NO, HANNAH, NOT AT ALL.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.505
'CAUSE YOU KIND OF
SEEM MAD AT ME.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.140
I PAY ALL THE BILLS
IN THIS APARTMENT.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.442
DOES THAT NOT GIVE ME,
LIKE, ONE NIGHT OFF

20:42.542 --> 20:44.744
FROM TALKING ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR PROBLEMS?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.212
OKAY. WOW.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.147
AS IT HAPPENS,
I'M NOT ALWAYS

20:48.247 --> 20:50.483
IN THE MOOD
TO TALK ABOUT YOU.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.720
OKAY. WOW.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.925
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO GO INTO THIS,

20:59.025 --> 21:01.894
BUT YOU PUSHED ME
LIKE YOU PUSH EVERYONE
ABOUT EVERYTHING!

21:01.994 --> 21:05.632
- I PUSH EVERYONE?
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
EAT MY YOGURT?

21:05.732 --> 21:08.401
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE
I SAID SOMETHING AWFUL

21:08.501 --> 21:10.470
BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.478
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU THINK WE ONLY TALK
ABOUT MY PROBLEMS?

21:18.578 --> 21:20.880
- WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?
- BECAUSE WE DO.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.215
THAT'S NOT TRUE, MARNIE.
WE ONLY TALK ABOUT
YOUR PROBLEMS.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.752
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.
SERIOUSLY.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.887
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT
WITH CHARLIE, THEN WHAT'S WRONG.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.922
NOW WE TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA MEET SOMEONE.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.858
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE
YOU THINK MEETING A GUY

21:31.958 --> 21:33.593
IS THE MAIN POINT OF LIFE,
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE,
LIKE, A SUMMIT

21:33.693 --> 21:35.528
EVERY DAY TO MAKE
A GAME PLAN.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.731
OKAY, YOU JUST
FLIPPED THIS AROUND IN
A REALLY CRAZY WAY.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.368
I AM THE ONE THAT HAS
THE RIGHT TO BE MAD HERE, OKAY?

21:41.468 --> 21:44.471
I'M TAKING A VERY BRAVE CHANCE
DISCUSSING MY FEELINGS.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.738
WELL, YOU SHOULD MAYBE
BRING THINGS UP

21:45.838 --> 21:47.640
WHILE THEY'RE
ACTUALLY HAPPENING,

21:47.740 --> 21:49.442
AND THEN WE COULD AVOID
THESE OVERWROUGHT
CONVERSATIONS.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.810
THEN I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.646
- WELL, I DO.
- WELL, NOW I DON'T.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.782
WELL,
NOW I NEED CLOSURE, OKAY?

21:55.882 --> 21:57.617
YOU ARE SO SELFISH.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.786
THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE
NO FRIENDS FROM PRESCHOOL.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
UH, I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS
FROM PRESCHOOL.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.656
I'M JUST NOT SPEAKING
TO THEM RIGHT NOW.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.291
NO, BUT YOU JUDGE EVERYONE,

22:05.392 --> 22:07.794
AND YET YOU ASK THEM
NOT TO JUDGE YOU.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.629
THAT IS BECAUSE NO ONE
COULD EVER HATE ME

22:09.729 --> 22:11.564
AS MUCH AS
I HATE MYSELF, OKAY?

22:11.664 --> 22:14.100
SO ANY MEAN THING SOMEONE'S
GONNA THINK OF TO SAY
ABOUT ME,

22:14.200 --> 22:17.236
I'VE ALREADY SAID TO ME,
ABOUT ME, PROBABLY IN
THE LAST HALF HOUR!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.406
THAT IS BULLSHIT,
BECAUSE I COULD LITERALLY

22:19.506 --> 22:21.474
THINK OF A MILLION
MEAN THINGS

22:21.574 --> 22:23.309
THAT HAVE NEVER
ONCE OCCURRED TO YOU.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.911
OH, YEAH?
LIKE WHAT?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.813
WELL, I WOULDN'T
DO THAT.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.753
SERIOUSLY, SAY ONE.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.688
- HONESTLY, MARNIE,
YOU ARE SO OBSESSED...
- OH, MY GOD.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.356
...WITH SUCCESS
AND WHO'S WHO

22:37.457 --> 22:38.891
AND WHAT THEY HAVE
AND HOW THEY GOT IT.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.860
LIKE, I WAS LOOKING AT
TALLY SCHIFRIN THE OTHER NIGHT

22:40.960 --> 22:42.495
AND I THOUGHT
YOU PROBABLY WISH
SHE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.163
IT'S PRETTY
TRANSPARENT.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.565
SO YOU CAN TELL
EVERYONE TO TUNE IN

22:45.665 --> 22:48.200
AND HEAR YOUR BEST FRIEND
ON "FRESH AIR."

22:48.300 --> 22:49.869
I LIKE BEING AROUND PEOPLE

22:49.969 --> 22:52.304
- WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.
- PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

22:52.405 --> 22:55.508
'CAUSE WHAT DO YOU WANT
BESIDES A BOYFRIEND WITH
A LUXURY RENTAL?

22:55.608 --> 22:57.577
SERIOUSLY, THAT'S WHERE
YOUR PRIORITIES ARE.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.378
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY
AND NOW IT IS WORSE.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.213
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE WORSE.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.982
I CAN'T TAKE YOU ANYMORE.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.418
YOU THINK THAT EVERYONE
IN THE WORLD IS OUT
TO HUMILIATE YOU.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.186
YOU'RE LIKE A BIG,
UGLY FUCKING WOUND!

23:07.286 --> 23:10.690
ADAM SAYS YOU ARE
TEETERING ON THE EDGE
OF PSYCHOTIC MISERY,

23:10.790 --> 23:12.492
BUT YOU'RE SMILING SO WIDE
THAT NO ONE CAN TELL.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.527
- YOU ARE THE WOUND.
- I AM NOT THE WOUND.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.463
- YOU ARE THE WOUND.
- YOU'RE THE WOUND.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.830
- YOU'RE THE WOUND!
- YOU ARE THE WOUND!

23:17.930 --> 23:19.832
STOP SAYING THAT.
I AM NOT A WOUND.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.635
- YOU ARE A WOUND.
- MAYBE WE'RE OVER-
ANALYZING THIS

23:22.735 --> 23:24.704
AND THE ISSUE IS JUST
THAT I'VE GOT A BOYFRIEND

23:24.804 --> 23:26.939
AND YOU DON'T AND IT'S
AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.411
THAT'S AWESOME. THAT IS
A REALLY, REALLY MATURE WAY

23:32.512 --> 23:34.781
TO DEAL WITH
YOUR FUCKING FEELINGS!

23:34.881 --> 23:36.783
I WOULD BACK THE FUCK OFF
IF I WERE YOU!

23:36.883 --> 23:38.618
OH, I'M FUCKING
TERRIFIED.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.853
SERIOUSLY. I MEAN, I'M NOT,
BUT I PROBABLY SHOULD BE,

23:40.953 --> 23:42.321
CONSIDERING YOU'VE BEEN
BATSHIT CRAZY

23:42.421 --> 23:44.090
EVER SINCE CHARLIE
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

23:44.190 --> 23:47.560
YEAH? WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
CRAZY SINCE BEFORE
I EVEN MET YOU.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.529
YOU'VE BEEN CRAZY
SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL

23:49.629 --> 23:51.898
WHEN YOU HAD TO MASTURBATE
EIGHT TIMES A NIGHT

23:51.998 --> 23:53.966
TO STAVE OFF DISEASES
OF THE MIND AND BODY.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.236
OKAY, THAT IS MY MOST
SHAMEFUL, PAINFUL,

23:57.336 --> 23:59.371
PRIVATE SECRET, OKAY?

23:59.472 --> 24:00.740
AND IT MIGHT SOUND
LIKE A JOKE,

24:00.840 --> 24:02.509
BUT IT IS NOT
FUCKING FUNNY TO ME!

24:02.609 --> 24:04.376
AND THAT IS WHY I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TELL ANYONE!

24:04.477 --> 24:07.514
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE!
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

24:07.614 --> 24:09.516
I AM JUST
TELLING YOU NOW!

24:09.616 --> 24:11.283
I WOULD NEVER
TELL ANYONE THAT!

24:11.383 --> 24:13.252
I AM A GOOD
FUCKING FRIEND!

24:13.352 --> 24:15.454
UNLIKE YOU!
YOU ARE A BAD FRIEND!

24:15.555 --> 24:17.690
MAYBE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME RIGHT NOW.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.292
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT BEING A GOOD FRIEND.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.028
I HAVE BIGGER CONCERNS.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.696
( sighs )

24:26.098 --> 24:29.301
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THANK YOU.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.237
THAT IS ALL
I NEEDED TO HEAR.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.573
I'M DONE.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.775
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

24:35.875 --> 24:38.978
I DO NOT WANT
TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE,

24:39.078 --> 24:40.847
NOT WITH YOU.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.414
YEAH, WELL,

24:42.515 --> 24:44.250
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
WITH YOU ANYMORE, EITHER,

24:44.350 --> 24:46.485
AND I AM NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE YOU SAID IT.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.755
I WAS THINKING IT,
BUT I DID NOT WANT TO SAY IT

24:48.855 --> 24:51.524
BECAUSE I AM A GOOD FRIEND
AND YOU ARE A BAD FRIEND!

24:51.624 --> 24:53.760
- FINE!
- GREAT!

24:53.860 --> 24:57.797
- AWESOME!
- VERY GOOD!

25:07.173 --> 25:11.377
* OH, YOU KNOW I NEED

25:11.477 --> 25:15.514
* YOUR MYSTIC MIND

25:20.219 --> 25:23.723
* FOR YOU ARE LEADING US

25:24.624 --> 25:28.094

IS A... *

25:36.836 --> 25:41.073
* A PART OF LIFE

25:45.745 --> 25:49.682
* OH, LOVE IS WON
WHEN WE ARE *

25:49.782 --> 25:53.786
* NOT BOUND BY TIME

26:02.995 --> 26:06.866
* WHEN WE HAVE ANIMALS,

26:06.966 --> 26:10.302
* WE'LL START A TRIBE

26:15.274 --> 26:18.678

AS WE ALL *

26:18.778 --> 26:22.715
* HEAD TOWARDS THE UN-BLIND

26:27.253 --> 26:30.857
* FELL INTO THE FAULT
AND NOW WE... *
