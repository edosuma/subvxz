WEBVTT

00:11.818 --> 00:13.069
Just you two tonight?

00:13.071 --> 00:15.054
I promised the birthday girl
we'd celebrate

00:15.056 --> 00:17.990
with a slice of pie no matter
what time my shift ended.

00:17.992 --> 00:19.659
Oh, don't tell me,
let me guess.

00:19.661 --> 00:21.361
You're...16.

00:21.363 --> 00:22.829
No, silly, I'm 7.

00:22.831 --> 00:24.163
Oh. Well, I tell you what.

00:24.165 --> 00:26.115
Why don't you do the honors

00:26.117 --> 00:28.401
and you pick the place to sit.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.788
Over there.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.906
Good choice.

00:33.908 --> 00:37.593
I personally think these are
the best seats in the house.

00:37.595 --> 00:39.595
Now, who wants some pie?

00:39.597 --> 00:42.348
You know what flavor
you want?

00:42.350 --> 00:43.633
What shall we get?

00:43.635 --> 00:44.750
Tell you what.

00:44.752 --> 00:47.220
Why don't I give you
a minute to decide

00:47.222 --> 00:48.971
and I'll come back
and take your order.

00:48.973 --> 00:51.724
Great, thanks.

00:55.779 --> 00:58.564
By the way, chocolate
cream pie's the best.

00:58.566 --> 00:59.732
Ok.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.117
Sorry for the wait.

01:01.119 --> 01:04.069
We're light
on staff tonight.

01:04.072 --> 01:06.489
That's the number 4-
scrambled eggs, hashbrowns,

01:06.491 --> 01:08.241
sausage, and bacon,

01:08.243 --> 01:11.828
and this is
on the house.

01:13.797 --> 01:17.116
Let me know if you need
anything else, hon.

01:17.118 --> 01:20.052
Good evening, Officer.

01:20.054 --> 01:21.003
Hey, Leah.

01:21.005 --> 01:22.555
Oh, I need to run
to the back

01:22.557 --> 01:24.674
to get more
cream and sugar.

01:24.676 --> 01:26.759
The only sugar I want
is you.

01:26.761 --> 01:30.963
I told you, I don't
date married men.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.765
What if I told you
my wife just moved out?

01:32.767 --> 01:35.685
Then I'd tell you
to lose the wedding band

01:35.687 --> 01:39.322
and then I'll consider.

01:39.324 --> 01:41.357
How we doin'
over here, hon?

01:41.359 --> 01:43.276
Is everything all right?

01:43.278 --> 01:46.529
Can I get you
something else?

01:47.481 --> 01:49.449
Ok. Uh...

01:49.451 --> 01:51.451
I'll just
leave this here,

01:51.453 --> 01:53.369
and whenever
you're ready--

01:53.371 --> 01:55.221

Baby.

02:30.408 --> 02:31.908
Babe?

02:31.910 --> 02:33.709
What are you doing?
Why are you still up?

02:33.711 --> 02:35.912
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
if I woke you up.

02:35.914 --> 02:38.764
The hospital just called.
A 6-car pileup on the east end.

02:38.766 --> 02:41.334
Oh, Rusty will probably
need a walk in a few hours.

02:41.336 --> 02:42.635
Do you mind taking him out?

02:42.637 --> 02:45.671
I already filled his bowls,
so he should be good for now.

02:45.673 --> 02:47.757
Oh.

02:47.759 --> 02:49.809
Uh, eggs and juice
in the fridge,

02:49.811 --> 02:51.394
so feel free to help yourself.

02:51.396 --> 02:53.039
I made a fresh pot of coffee.

02:53.064 --> 02:54.398
Make sure you unplug it
when you're done.

02:54.399 --> 02:57.683
Don't forget to lock up
when you leave.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.073

03:06.109 --> 03:08.928
Good morning to you, too.

Ohh...

03:13.918 --> 03:16.002
This is a joke, right?

03:18.455 --> 03:20.506
And everybody else
is practically done

03:20.508 --> 03:23.793
with their knitting projects,
even Ethel, who's like pushing 90.

03:23.795 --> 03:25.928
And this bathing suit
was supposed to be done in July

03:25.930 --> 03:28.097
and I keep having to rework it.
But I got this part, see.

03:28.099 --> 03:31.183
Yeah, it's fine.
It looks nice.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.887
You're not really looking
at my project.

03:34.889 --> 03:38.107
You always look at my projects, Derek.
What's wrong?

03:38.109 --> 03:41.978
[Sighs] Ah, baby girl,
I'm sorry. I mean, I don't know--

03:41.980 --> 03:45.281
me and Savannah,
we had like this amazing night.

03:45.283 --> 03:47.049
Mm-hmm.
Then cut to 4 hours later,

03:47.051 --> 03:50.069
she's throwing me an air kiss
and rushing out the door to work,

03:50.071 --> 03:53.289
and I'm stuck at 2:00 in the morning
walking her little pug.

03:53.291 --> 03:56.542
Ohh...you got Morganed.

03:56.544 --> 03:58.224
Morganed? What?
What are you talking about?

03:58.378 --> 04:01.664
You are on call 24/7,
and when a case comes in,

04:01.666 --> 04:05.635
you drop whatever
and whoever you are doing

04:05.637 --> 04:08.387
and you haul ass
back to work.

04:08.389 --> 04:11.173
Well, I guess I never
thought about it like that.

04:11.175 --> 04:14.393
And now you're having
what Oprah calls an aha moment.

04:14.395 --> 04:16.678
Think about it.
If you would have gotten that call,

04:16.680 --> 04:18.397
you would have done
the exact same thing to her.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.649
Because your job comes first
and so does hers.

04:20.652 --> 04:23.352
And that is why
you two work.

04:23.354 --> 04:25.438
Ohh...

04:25.440 --> 04:28.074
She is you in heels.

04:28.942 --> 04:31.277
[Sighs] You're right.

04:31.279 --> 04:32.578
Mm-hmm. I'm always right.

04:32.580 --> 04:35.081
Also, you're secretly
in love with me.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.082
Door?

04:36.084 --> 04:38.034
Forgive me.

04:40.370 --> 04:41.370
My queen.

04:41.372 --> 04:43.172
Don't let it happen again.

04:45.158 --> 04:47.259
A few hours ago,

04:47.261 --> 04:50.046
a lone gunman
shot and killed 3 people

04:50.048 --> 04:52.231
inside a downtown
Chicago diner.

04:52.233 --> 04:55.101
Then, he was taken down
by a plainclothes off-duty officer

04:55.103 --> 04:56.519
who happened to be
in the restaurant

04:56.521 --> 04:58.104
at the same time
of the shooting.

04:58.106 --> 04:59.438
Well, it sounds like
they got their guy.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.723
Why are they
requesting our help?

05:00.725 --> 05:02.892
Because an ATM
from across the street

05:02.894 --> 05:04.527
captured this image
of the shooter

05:04.529 --> 05:06.195
getting out of
a late-model sedan

05:06.197 --> 05:07.763
just moments
before the shooting

05:07.765 --> 05:11.450
and here's a shot
of his driver who then sped off.

05:11.452 --> 05:13.152
Chicago P.D.
I.D.'d the shooter

05:13.154 --> 05:14.520
as 16-year-old
Gavin Rossler

05:14.522 --> 05:17.073
after getting a composite match from
the national center

05:17.075 --> 05:18.691
for missing
and exploited children.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.544
According to the database,
Gavin's been missing for nearly 4 years.

05:21.546 --> 05:22.995
In looks like
back in 2009

05:22.997 --> 05:23.996
when the mother filed
the police report

05:23.998 --> 05:26.048
she insisted Gavin
had been abducted.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.917
Mom was not the most
credible source.

05:27.919 --> 05:29.585
She was in and out
of rehab facilities

05:29.587 --> 05:31.754
for drug and alcohol abuse,
died 6 months ago

05:31.756 --> 05:33.372
of an apparent
drug overdose.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.841
It says here Gavin had run away
from home  several times

05:35.843 --> 05:37.760
but always returned
within 24 hours.

05:37.762 --> 05:40.730
Which could by why local P.D.
initially categorized him

05:40.732 --> 05:42.064
as a runaway
rather than missing.

05:42.066 --> 05:43.399
So where's this kid
been all this time,

05:43.401 --> 05:45.067
and where did he meet
his partner in crime?

05:45.069 --> 05:47.153
Garcia, have you
been able to I.D. the driver?

05:47.155 --> 05:48.487
Negative.
I'm running the image

05:48.489 --> 05:50.222
through facial recognition
software right now, though.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.074
We can't rule out
the possibility that the driver

05:52.076 --> 05:53.826
is the person responsible
for Gavin's disappearance.

05:53.828 --> 05:55.394
If that's the case,
chances are

05:55.396 --> 05:56.946
he's out looking
for his next victim.

05:56.948 --> 06:01.117
How does a 12-year-old runaway
turn into a cold-blooded killer?

06:01.119 --> 06:02.868
Wheels up in 30.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.371
Reporter: ...A senseless
act of violence.

06:05.373 --> 06:07.323
I'm standing here
with Sylvia Hoover,

06:07.325 --> 06:09.820
who was at the diner with
her 7-year-old daughter

06:09.821 --> 06:10.794
at the time of the shooting.

06:10.795 --> 06:14.380
Sylvia, can you tell us
in your own words what happened?

06:14.382 --> 06:16.849
I was sitting at the counter
with my daughter

06:16.851 --> 06:19.018
when I heard a woman
screaming,

06:19.020 --> 06:21.937
and that's when I turned around
and saw the gun.

06:21.939 --> 06:26.942
And I don't know, this kid just
stood up and started shooting.

07:13.878 --> 07:15.344
Leah Rollins

late-night cravings,

there was no connection

It looks as though he was born into

Dad's been incarcerated

07:34.816 --> 07:37.233
On two separate occasions he was
removed from his mother's custody

07:37.235 --> 07:38.684
and placed in foster care.

07:38.686 --> 07:41.070
Well, despite all that,
he managed to get good grades.

07:41.072 --> 07:42.805
JJ: So 4 years ago--

07:42.807 --> 07:44.807
why did he choose
that day to leave?

07:44.809 --> 07:47.076
Well, that's
if he left by choice.

07:47.078 --> 07:49.495
Well, the mom's boyfriend
moved in a couple weeks prior.

07:49.497 --> 07:51.030
Maybe he and Gavin
were bumping heads.

07:51.032 --> 07:52.582
I mean, things might have
even gotten physical

07:52.584 --> 07:54.167
between the two of them.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.819
Rossi: Yeah, at one point mom
admitted that she and prince charming

07:56.821 --> 07:59.589
had been out on a binge
for a couple of days.

07:59.591 --> 08:01.424
Which means Gavin
would have been left home alone

08:01.426 --> 08:02.708
to fend for himself.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.178
And I'm sure
that wasn't the first time.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.996
Maybe he just had enough.

08:06.998 --> 08:09.182
This kid's from Garfield Park.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.666
That's prime gang territory.

08:10.668 --> 08:13.002
If he was left unsupervised
from sunup to sundown,

08:13.004 --> 08:14.770
chances are he fell in
with the wrong crowd.

08:14.772 --> 08:16.722
Chicago has one of the
largest gang populations,

08:16.724 --> 08:20.376
over 100,000 active members.
Last year 61% of all homicides

08:20.378 --> 08:21.777
were found to be gang related.

08:21.779 --> 08:23.479
Well, it makes sense.
I mean, the kid runs away from home

08:23.481 --> 08:25.014
and finds himself
out on the street.

08:25.016 --> 08:26.849
Then some knucklehead
gangbangers come along,

08:26.851 --> 08:28.868
recruit him,
and promise him protection.

08:28.870 --> 08:31.454
Next thing you know,
he's got the "family" that he never had.

08:31.456 --> 08:33.456
Garcia, we need a list
of active gangs

08:33.457 --> 08:34.690
operating in the area.
Copy that.

08:34.692 --> 08:36.491
We need to hit
the ground running.

08:36.494 --> 08:38.327
If this is some sort
of mass gang initiation,

08:38.328 --> 08:41.746
it could be the first
of a series of attacks.

08:52.226 --> 08:54.237
Detective Mark Reyes,
Chicago P.D.

08:54.262 --> 08:56.096
thank you both for coming out.

08:56.097 --> 08:57.763
I thought there, uh,

08:57.765 --> 09:01.067
I thought there weren't
any cameras.

09:01.069 --> 09:02.218
Those are phony.

09:02.220 --> 09:03.986
Cheaper than installing
the real thing.

09:03.988 --> 09:06.189
In this neighborhood,
you gotta put something

09:06.191 --> 09:07.690
to deter would-be robbers.

09:07.692 --> 09:09.242
According to witnesses,

09:09.244 --> 09:11.277
the gunman...

09:11.279 --> 09:14.280
sat right over there.

09:14.282 --> 09:16.132
Then without warning,
he just stood up

09:16.134 --> 09:18.501
and started firing.

09:18.503 --> 09:21.403
Gavin had
no criminal record,

09:21.405 --> 09:24.173
enters cool and collected
and orders a meal.

09:24.175 --> 09:25.625
Normally it takes
time and practice

09:25.627 --> 09:27.510
to build up
to something like this.

09:27.512 --> 09:30.046
Rarely does anything
these punks do make sense.

09:30.048 --> 09:33.516
Which makes me wonder
why Gavin chose this diner

09:33.518 --> 09:35.518
for his first offense.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.053
I mean, there's
a police station

09:37.055 --> 09:38.521
just a few blocks away.

09:38.523 --> 09:41.357
Not to mention,
aren't gang initiations

09:41.359 --> 09:44.143
known for inciting violence
against rival gangs?

09:44.145 --> 09:46.646
True. And typically, these guys like
to leave their marks.

09:46.648 --> 09:48.614
There weren't any tags
claiming responsibility.

09:48.616 --> 09:51.083
Gangbangers are driven
by money and power.

09:51.085 --> 09:54.070
Gavin didn't seem
to be driven by either.

09:54.072 --> 09:55.238
What do you mean?

09:55.240 --> 09:56.872
Well, if it really
had been about money,

09:56.874 --> 09:59.041
Gavin would have
entered the diner

09:59.043 --> 10:02.044
and immediately
gone to the register.

10:02.046 --> 10:04.380
And if it had been
about power,

10:04.382 --> 10:06.048
he probably would have
walked around,

10:06.050 --> 10:08.134
flashed his gun
to maximize terror.

10:08.136 --> 10:10.419
So if it wasn't
gang related,

10:10.421 --> 10:12.255
what was it?

10:12.257 --> 10:15.675
That's a good question.

10:18.679 --> 10:21.097
Single gunshot wound
to the chest.

10:21.099 --> 10:23.899
He died before
paramedics arrived.

10:23.901 --> 10:24.609
Still trying to determine

10:24.634 --> 10:26.600
what caused these burns
on his temple.

10:27.188 --> 10:28.904
Have you gotten back
the toxicology results?

10:28.906 --> 10:30.273
He was clean.

10:30.275 --> 10:32.141
No drugs or alcohol.

10:32.143 --> 10:33.909
Excuse me.

10:33.911 --> 10:36.028
Was this everything?

10:36.030 --> 10:37.246
That's all he came with.

10:37.248 --> 10:38.748
Well, how many kids
you know these days

10:38.750 --> 10:40.249
that don't carry
a phone on them?

10:40.251 --> 10:43.085
The first thing a runaway does
is pick up a disposable.

10:43.087 --> 10:45.171
Most of the time
we get street kids,

10:45.173 --> 10:46.872
they'll be somewhat
malnourished

10:46.874 --> 10:49.592
or have some type
of correlating health issues.

10:49.594 --> 10:52.762
He didn't show
any signs of either.

10:52.764 --> 10:54.663
It seems like whoever
this kid was with

10:54.665 --> 10:56.299
at least made sure
he was fed properly.

10:56.301 --> 10:58.517
There's multiple
spinal fractures

10:58.519 --> 11:00.269
on both arms.

11:00.271 --> 11:01.771
When I took the X-rays,
it was evident

11:01.773 --> 11:03.672
that his fractures
hadn't healed properly.

11:03.674 --> 11:05.391
Typically you only
see that in cases of abuse

11:05.393 --> 11:07.059
with toddlers
and young children,

11:07.061 --> 11:08.527
not someone Gavin's age.

11:08.529 --> 11:10.363
Well, whoever did this
had to have literally

11:10.365 --> 11:11.897
twisted his arms
until they broke.

11:11.899 --> 11:13.532
Were you able to determine
if these injuries occurred

11:13.534 --> 11:15.201
before or after
he was reported missing?

11:15.203 --> 11:18.037
I'd say somewhere as early
as 6 months ago.

11:18.039 --> 11:20.122
That rules out
the mom and boyfriend.

11:20.124 --> 11:23.409
If they didn't
cause them, who did?

11:26.546 --> 11:28.714
Look, I don't know
what good this is gonna do.

11:28.716 --> 11:30.716
Now, I wrote everything up
in my report.

11:30.718 --> 11:34.253
Well, uh, sometimes
our subconscious picks up details

11:34.255 --> 11:36.472
our conscious minds
aren't aware of.

11:36.474 --> 11:38.674
Can you close your eyes
for me?

11:42.429 --> 11:44.397
Ok.

11:44.399 --> 11:48.901
Now, I need you to take me
back to the diner.

11:48.903 --> 11:50.770
Can you see Gavin?

11:50.772 --> 11:53.272
Sitting on the other side
of the diner.

11:53.274 --> 11:55.274
Leah stopped
to check on him.

11:55.276 --> 11:57.410
Did you hear anything
they said to each other?

11:57.412 --> 12:00.178
They were sitting
too far away.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.380
As soon as she put
the check down,

12:01.405 --> 12:03.405
that's when I heard the first shot.

12:03.701 --> 12:04.700
[Gunshot]

12:04.702 --> 12:05.718
Aah!

12:05.720 --> 12:07.203
All hell broke loose.

12:07.205 --> 12:10.289
Ok, now, I need you
to focus on Gavin

12:10.291 --> 12:11.407
and stay with him.

12:11.409 --> 12:13.459
[Screaming]

12:13.461 --> 12:15.594
The guy at the table,
he tried to run.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.546
The kid got him
in the chest.

12:17.548 --> 12:18.881
Where did he fire
his next shot?

12:18.883 --> 12:20.766
This woman, she was
sitting at the counter.

12:20.768 --> 12:22.852
She was just looking
for a way out.

12:22.854 --> 12:25.137
Is that when
you took your shot?

12:26.589 --> 12:29.191
I was next.

12:36.199 --> 12:40.319
I'll never forget the look
in that kid's eyes.

12:42.656 --> 12:46.425
It was like
he was ready to die.

12:49.830 --> 12:53.382
They say the worst part
about being a cop

12:53.384 --> 12:56.335
is watching these people
die in front of you.

12:57.921 --> 13:00.256
They were right.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.510
A .9 beretta
semiautomatic

13:04.512 --> 13:06.011
with government
markings.

13:06.013 --> 13:07.980
Military.

13:07.982 --> 13:11.233
These days you can buy
almost anything off the streets.

13:11.235 --> 13:13.352
Which is why I have my guys
running serial numbers.

13:13.354 --> 13:15.104
Hopefully we can come up
with some type of match.

13:15.106 --> 13:16.822
Even if they come back
with a match,

13:16.824 --> 13:18.726
chances are this weapon's
made its way through

13:18.751 --> 13:20.751
a number of pawn shops.

13:21.361 --> 13:23.279
Then that's where
we'll start.

13:23.281 --> 13:24.436
The most important thing
to find out now is where

13:24.461 --> 13:25.673
Gavin got his hands on that.

13:27.984 --> 13:29.201
Go ahead, mama.

13:29.203 --> 13:31.587
I pulled this video footage
from across the street

13:31.589 --> 13:34.423
from the diner. I managed to get
a partial plate off the car.

13:34.425 --> 13:36.091
I'm running it now.

13:38.879 --> 13:40.880
Garcia, can you pause it?

13:40.882 --> 13:45.000
Rewind it a moment
just after Gavin steps out of the car.

13:52.058 --> 13:54.226
You see that? The driver
didn't wait around

13:54.228 --> 13:56.061
for him to enter the diner
before he drove off.

13:56.063 --> 13:57.863
Well, maybe he sensed
something was up.

13:57.865 --> 13:59.532
Why not wait to make sure
everything went as planned?

13:59.534 --> 14:02.067
I mean, what if something went wrong
and the mission had to be aborted?

14:02.069 --> 14:03.636
How would the driver
let him know inside?

14:03.638 --> 14:04.870
He couldn't even
if he wanted to.

14:04.872 --> 14:06.205
Gavin didn't
have a phone on him.

14:06.207 --> 14:07.823
Maybe that's why
the driver drove off.

14:07.825 --> 14:11.243
He knew that Gavin wasn't planning on
leaving the diner alive.

14:11.245 --> 14:13.746
This was a suicide mission.

14:15.966 --> 14:20.469
[Indistinct chatter]

14:28.061 --> 14:30.729
[Tires screeching]

14:30.731 --> 14:33.432
[People screaming]

14:37.821 --> 14:40.155
What the hell's
wrong with you?!

14:40.157 --> 14:42.775
You could've killed somebody!

14:42.777 --> 14:45.494
Get out of the vehicle
right now!

14:45.496 --> 14:48.664
Get the hell
out of the car!

14:48.666 --> 14:49.865
Do you hear me?

14:49.867 --> 14:52.067
Get out of the car!

14:53.753 --> 14:56.005
I know that look.

14:56.007 --> 14:57.423
The wheels are turning.

14:57.425 --> 14:59.592
I've seen this
before.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.243
Muzzle-flash burns.

15:01.245 --> 15:04.330
We'd occasionally see this
on POWs in Vietnam.

15:04.332 --> 15:07.933
So someone held a gun to his head
and repeatedly fired blanks.

15:07.935 --> 15:10.636
That's incredibly risky, especially
considering the margin of error

15:10.638 --> 15:13.305
when you're holding the barrel of a gun
to someone's temporal bone.

15:13.307 --> 15:15.274
The discharge alone
can cause the skull to shatter.

15:15.276 --> 15:18.060
Which means not only
did this person

15:18.062 --> 15:20.362
want to put the fear
of God into Gavin,

15:20.364 --> 15:23.198
but he knew exactly
how to do it without killing him.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.817
This poor kid was tortured.

15:24.819 --> 15:26.368
Or trained.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.770
What if whoever did this
wanted to make sure

15:28.772 --> 15:31.557
if he got caught
he'd never talk?

15:31.559 --> 15:33.659
Keep these people back.

15:33.661 --> 15:36.612
If this punk isn't gonna
move on his own, I'll do it myself.

15:36.614 --> 15:37.897
Get back in your car!

15:37.899 --> 15:39.748
Sir, come on, let's go.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.500
Get me a tow truck
at the intersection

15:41.502 --> 15:43.168
of Ashland and Division.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.503
I have a burgundy Toyota,

15:44.505 --> 15:45.804
Illinois plate number

15:45.806 --> 15:48.974
4-Victor-Bravo
Hotel-Sierra-2.

15:48.976 --> 15:50.626
Hotch: What have you
got, Garcia?

15:50.628 --> 15:52.895
I was finally able
to clean up that grainy mess.

15:52.897 --> 15:55.648
Here is our mystery driver.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.399
He can't be much older
than Gavin.

15:57.401 --> 15:59.101
Reid: They're dressed
exactly the same.

15:59.103 --> 16:00.686
Which is why I ran
the image through

16:00.688 --> 16:02.237
advanced facial
age regression software

16:02.239 --> 16:04.156
and then I cross-referenced it
with the statewide database.

16:04.158 --> 16:07.543
Our driver is 17-year-old
Trevor Madison from Arlington heights.

16:07.545 --> 16:09.361
Another missing kid?

16:09.363 --> 16:11.697
Yeah. This is where it goes
from wack to super wack

16:11.699 --> 16:13.032
with a side of awful.

16:13.034 --> 16:16.335
Trevor went missing
less than 24 hours after Gavin.

16:16.337 --> 16:17.537
And nobody made
the connection?

16:17.538 --> 16:19.488
No. The other cases were
in different jurisdictions,

16:19.490 --> 16:22.708
so there hasn't been any physical evidence
linking the cases until now.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.793
These kids aren't runaways.
They were abducted.

16:24.795 --> 16:26.345
We got a hit
from the APB.

16:26.347 --> 16:27.680
Trevor filled up
at a gas station

16:27.682 --> 16:29.515
off the interstate
a half hour ago.

16:29.517 --> 16:31.016
Sounds like someone's
thinking about skipping town.

16:31.018 --> 16:32.551
It's been hours
since the shooting.

16:32.553 --> 16:34.186
He could have made it
across state lines by now,

16:34.188 --> 16:35.888
but he stuck around.
Why?

16:35.890 --> 16:38.273
One of my officers has just
radioed for a tow truck.

16:38.275 --> 16:40.528
The kid has barricaded
himself inside the car.

16:40.553 --> 16:41.611
He's at the intersection--

16:41.612 --> 16:43.228
Evacuate the area.

16:43.230 --> 16:44.647
Evacuate the area.

16:44.649 --> 16:46.181
Man: Dude, what's going on?

16:46.183 --> 16:48.867
Radio: All units on site
at Ashland and Division,

16:48.869 --> 16:50.319
evacuate immediately.

16:50.321 --> 16:52.638
Repeat--evacuate immediately.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.023
You guys, back up!
Suspect may be armed with...

16:55.025 --> 16:56.725
Back up--

17:21.431 --> 17:23.817
The media's already
running with the story.

17:23.818 --> 17:25.968
They're calling it
an act of terrorism.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.770
We'll release a statement as
soon as we confirm

17:27.771 --> 17:29.471
the source
of the explosion.

17:29.473 --> 17:32.942
Clayburn says the phones
are ringing off the hook.

17:32.944 --> 17:35.394
Got every precinct in town
looking for answers.

17:35.396 --> 17:37.363
You should reach out
to neighboring jurisdictions,

17:37.365 --> 17:40.199
let them know we'll update them
as soon as we learn more.

17:40.201 --> 17:43.869
These guys
have everybody on edge.

17:43.871 --> 17:45.421
Nobody feels safe
when a cop gets killed.

17:45.423 --> 17:47.957
Well, until we catch them,
we should all be on high alert.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.292
The explosive used
was highly sophisticated.

17:50.294 --> 17:53.262
It was designed specifically
for maximum damage.

17:53.264 --> 17:55.181
That's why he stopped
to get gas.

17:55.183 --> 17:57.183
The more fuel,
the bigger the boom.

17:57.185 --> 17:59.518
How'd these kids
get involved in domestic terrorism?

17:59.520 --> 18:02.438
Whoever abducted
Gavin and Trevor

18:02.440 --> 18:04.724
spent years programming
them as soldiers.

18:04.726 --> 18:07.342
When the time was right,
they were released

18:07.344 --> 18:09.028
to carry out
their captors' mission.

18:09.030 --> 18:12.948
It's more than likely
that these two weren't the only ones.

18:14.201 --> 18:16.518
It's possible we're dealing with
a terrorist organization

18:16.520 --> 18:17.870
with one man at the center.

18:17.872 --> 18:19.739
We're basing our profile
on his motivation.

18:19.741 --> 18:21.374
We believe these
children were abducted

18:21.376 --> 18:24.243
by a preferential offender who targets
prepubescent boys.

18:24.245 --> 18:26.078
Our unsub is likely
a male in his 40s

18:26.080 --> 18:28.748
with some military
or law enforcement training.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.416
We think he has
a secluded location

18:30.418 --> 18:33.969
that provides enough privacy to hold
his victims captive for several years.

18:33.971 --> 18:36.255
Rossi: In that time
he breaks these kids down

18:36.257 --> 18:38.424
and rebuilds them
to be hardened soldiers.

18:38.426 --> 18:41.227
We believe they're suffering from an
extreme case of Stockholm syndrome.

18:41.229 --> 18:43.712
Much like Patty Hearst, who came
to view the SLA as her new family

18:43.714 --> 18:45.547
and the rest of the world
as adversaries,

18:45.549 --> 18:49.268
we believe he's attempting to instill
this same feeling within his army.

18:49.270 --> 18:51.553
He likely uses military
torture techniques

18:51.555 --> 18:54.073
to get his victims
to see his enemies as their own.

18:54.075 --> 18:56.742
Reid: He puts them through a rigorous
and punishing military training regimen

18:56.744 --> 18:59.061
in order to prepare them
mentally and physically for his war.

18:59.063 --> 19:00.780
Morgan: Once this happens,
the physical threat stop

19:00.782 --> 19:02.581
and the reprogramming
begins.

19:02.583 --> 19:03.899
And now that
he has their trust,

19:03.901 --> 19:06.168
he maintains this connection
by bolstering them

19:06.170 --> 19:08.003
with love and affection.

19:08.005 --> 19:09.405
His connection to them
is important.

19:09.406 --> 19:11.540
It ensures once
they're released,

19:11.542 --> 19:13.408
they will not deviate
from their orders.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.411
His ultimate target has
yet to be determined,

19:16.413 --> 19:18.547
but it could be as broad
as American citizens.

19:18.549 --> 19:21.350
These attacks have been
well orchestrated, methodical,

19:21.352 --> 19:24.770
and extremely violent in order
to maximize destruction and panic.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.213
Hotch: Which is why we need
to get ahead of him in order

19:26.238 --> 19:27.607
to prevent more bloodshed.

19:27.608 --> 19:30.976
But in order to do that, we need
to identify the source of his rage.

19:32.746 --> 19:35.597
Who sent you?

19:39.102 --> 19:41.570
I said...

19:41.572 --> 19:44.073
Who the hell sent you?

19:47.277 --> 19:48.794
[Click]

19:54.050 --> 19:56.469
How did I do this time?

19:56.471 --> 19:59.454
Guys, I think I know why the unsub
targeted Gavin and Trevor.

19:59.456 --> 20:00.956
Garcia,
are you still there?

20:00.958 --> 20:04.059
I have now connected
1, 2, 3, 4 missing kids to this unsub.

20:04.061 --> 20:05.895
Walk with me through
the darkness if you will.

20:05.897 --> 20:07.796
Brandon Rutherford
and Vincent Gamble--

20:07.798 --> 20:09.648
they disappeared within
24 hours of each other

20:09.650 --> 20:13.736
6 months before Gavin
and Trevor did,

20:13.738 --> 20:16.138
and then their bodies
were found two weeks later.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.606
It's possible they were
his first victims.

20:17.608 --> 20:20.475
But he killed them,
so it may not be the same unsub.

20:20.477 --> 20:22.444
The M.E. reports for
both Brandon and Vincent

20:22.446 --> 20:24.479
were consistent with
the type of torture Gavin suffered,

20:24.481 --> 20:25.865
but theirs was
much more severe.

20:25.867 --> 20:29.201
These two probably rebelled
against the unsub's programming,

20:29.203 --> 20:30.786
so he got rid of them.

20:30.788 --> 20:33.956
Uh, yeah, that brings us
to Steven Walker and Daniel Morrison.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.291
They were 12 years old

20:35.293 --> 20:38.327
when the were abducted,
again, within 24 hours of each other,

20:38.329 --> 20:42.097
and this happened two years after Gavin
and Trevor disappeared.

20:42.099 --> 20:45.050
Steven Walker's body
was found a year ago in a wooded area

20:45.052 --> 20:47.852
just outside the city,
and his injuries were consistent

20:47.877 --> 20:49.742
with the other boys.

20:50.358 --> 20:51.857
Rossi: All of these kids
were high-risk targets.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.275
Gavin and Trevor,

20:53.277 --> 20:54.727
they lived in
gang territory.

20:54.729 --> 20:56.195
Brandon and Vincent
were street kids.

20:56.197 --> 20:59.681
Steven and Daniel both came from
single-parent homes.

20:59.683 --> 21:02.401
His ruse could be as simple
as showing them attention,

21:02.403 --> 21:04.620
something they may not
have received at home.

21:04.622 --> 21:07.623
There's something known
as the magical age, between 9 and 12,

21:07.625 --> 21:09.241
when a child's psyche
is more malleable.

21:09.243 --> 21:11.243
That could be why the unsub
changed his victimology.

21:11.245 --> 21:13.579
Like the child soldiers
being recruited by the rebels in Sudan,

21:13.581 --> 21:16.665
they lack the physical and emotional
maturity to resist their captors.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.751
He realized that
the younger that he went,

21:18.753 --> 21:21.136
the easier they
would be to control

21:21.138 --> 21:23.138
Brandon was taken at 15. Maybe
he was too old to respond

21:23.140 --> 21:24.640
to the unsub's
conditioning.

21:24.642 --> 21:27.476
And Daniel was 12
when he was abducted.

21:27.478 --> 21:30.095
So there's a possibility
he's still alive.

21:30.097 --> 21:31.480
He'd be 15 now.

21:31.482 --> 21:34.099
He's likely proven himself a good
and cooperative soldier.

21:34.101 --> 21:36.402
That submission may
have earned him a degree of freedom.

21:36.404 --> 21:37.719
What are you thinking?

21:37.721 --> 21:39.271
Even though he's a soldier,
he's still a teenager.

21:39.273 --> 21:41.574
So maybe the best way
to reach him is through the media.

21:41.576 --> 21:44.326
It's possible Daniel has access to
a television, maybe even the Internet.

21:44.328 --> 21:48.948
Once these boys are programmed,
they're probably hard to break.

21:48.950 --> 21:51.417
Right now it's all we have.

21:55.338 --> 21:57.089
I don't know
if I can do this.

21:57.091 --> 21:59.842
Look at all of them.

21:59.844 --> 22:01.293
I've heard those reporters.

22:01.295 --> 22:05.264
They're wrong.
Danny is the victim here.

22:05.266 --> 22:06.465
All these boys are.

22:06.467 --> 22:08.634
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

22:08.636 --> 22:12.137
If there is any chance that
my baby is still alive...

22:12.139 --> 22:15.224
Which is why we need
your help in getting through to him.

22:15.226 --> 22:19.311
Right now Daniel is probably unaware
of how much you love and miss him.

22:19.313 --> 22:23.482
I need you to remind him
that you are his family.

22:23.484 --> 22:24.599
Ok?

22:24.601 --> 22:26.285
They're ready.

22:26.287 --> 22:28.537
Thank you.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.659
There she is!
Ms. Morrison!

22:33.661 --> 22:35.661
Have you heard
from Daniel?

22:35.663 --> 22:36.996
You saw Daniel?

22:36.998 --> 22:38.130
Can you tell us anything?

22:38.132 --> 22:41.450
My name is
Lauren Morrison.

22:41.452 --> 22:43.419
I'm not very good at this.

22:43.421 --> 22:45.387
But I, uh, would like
to get a message

22:45.389 --> 22:47.506
to my son Daniel.

22:47.508 --> 22:53.062
I'm...so sorry
that I wasn't there

22:53.064 --> 22:56.815
to protect you when
you needed me the most.

22:56.817 --> 22:59.568
If you're out there...

22:59.570 --> 23:04.023
If you're listening
to this...

23:05.775 --> 23:12.197
Please, Danny, I just
want you to come home.

23:12.199 --> 23:15.951
I just want you to come home.

23:15.953 --> 23:18.754
Reporter: That was Lauren Morrison,
whose missing son Daniel

23:18.756 --> 23:21.457
is possibly connected
to this recent wave of violence.

23:21.459 --> 23:23.959
Residents are still being
advised to remain vigilant

Danny?

25:27.167 --> 25:30.385
Danny...focus on me.

25:30.387 --> 25:32.454
Hey. Just look at me.

25:32.456 --> 25:34.956
I know you've been
given your orders.

25:34.958 --> 25:38.310
But I want you to think
about your mother for a second.

25:38.312 --> 25:40.896
All she wants is for
her son to come home.

25:40.898 --> 25:43.131
Daniel, she's been
waiting on you for a long time.

25:43.133 --> 25:44.850
Just do this for her.

25:44.852 --> 25:47.802
Don't make her suffer
any longer.

part of the training.

and serial number.

27:24.083 --> 27:27.051
I don't know, most serial numbers
have at least 9 digits.

27:27.053 --> 27:28.419
He keeps repeating
the same 5,

27:28.421 --> 27:31.439
which means it has some
sort of special meaning to the unsub.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.141
Maybe it's a military code
of some sort?

27:33.143 --> 27:34.892
Garcia already checked.

27:34.894 --> 27:36.277
Came up empty.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.279

for his attack.

who knows why isn't talking.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.766
Maybe JJ
will have more luck.

27:47.956 --> 27:51.459
I know this can't be
easy for you,

27:51.461 --> 27:55.880
but I need you
to keep in mind

27:55.882 --> 27:58.115
that Daniel
isn't the same kid.

27:58.117 --> 28:00.384

I'm sorry. I don't want
to overwhelm you.

29:36.316 --> 29:41.519
Um, I'm gonna be outside
with Agent Jareau.

30:06.795 --> 30:08.462
Reporter:
With 12 confirmed deaths,

30:08.464 --> 30:10.298
police have finally
been able to make an arrest

30:10.300 --> 30:13.267
in connection with
the recent string of deadly attacks.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.136
Sources close
to the investigation

30:15.138 --> 30:16.786
believe Daniel Morrison

30:16.811 --> 30:18.851
is linked to not only last
night's shooting massacre

30:19.475 --> 30:22.777
at a popular local diner,
but also the car explosion

30:22.779 --> 30:26.063
that rocked the downtown
area earlier this morning.

30:26.065 --> 30:28.816
The questions on everyone's
mind: How could children

30:28.818 --> 30:30.651
be at the center
of such tragedy?

30:30.653 --> 30:32.370
And where do they go
from here?

30:32.372 --> 30:35.873
We're going to be speaking
to child psychologist Marty Walton--

30:49.921 --> 30:52.506
All right, let's look
at victimology again.

30:52.508 --> 30:56.093
First attack, the diner.
Victims across the board.

30:56.095 --> 30:57.419
Second attack, car bombing.

30:57.444 --> 30:59.473
Same goal--take out as many
victims as possible.

31:00.016 --> 31:01.649
Third attack, attempted
mass shooting,

31:01.651 --> 31:02.595
but on a much bigger scale.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.568
God knows how many people
he would have killed.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.404
What if it's not about
the attack itself

31:06.406 --> 31:08.439
but what happened
leading up to them?

31:08.441 --> 31:11.244
Officer Clayburn entered that diner
just minutes before the shooting.

31:11.639 --> 31:13.815
But the explosive was detonated
just moments after

31:13.840 --> 31:15.530
the traffic cop radioed for help.

31:15.531 --> 31:19.266
And as soon as Daniel
saw Reyes...

31:19.268 --> 31:21.369
his whole demeanor changed.

31:21.371 --> 31:23.504
They're targeting Chicago P.D.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.841
They forced our hand.

31:29.628 --> 31:34.548
Now, we're gonna have to teach them
a lesson they'll never forget.

31:37.519 --> 31:39.169
How did Gavin know
that there would be

31:39.171 --> 31:42.273
a cop in the diner
at that exact moment?

31:42.275 --> 31:44.675
Chicago has over 13,000
police officers.

31:44.677 --> 31:46.727
That's roughly
60 per square mile.

31:46.729 --> 31:48.946
There are two precincts
within a 4-block radius of the diner.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.365
My guess is it was only a matter
of time before a cop walked in.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.350
And if it was his mission,
he was probably prepared

31:53.352 --> 31:54.869
to wait all night
if he had to.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.787
It wasn't a coincidence
the attack happened

31:56.789 --> 31:58.289
shortly after
the night shift ended.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.691
They learned the routines,
planned ahead.

32:00.693 --> 32:02.243
Well, that brings us back
to square one.

32:02.245 --> 32:03.794
The list of people
that have problems

32:03.796 --> 32:06.247
with law enforcement
is a long one.

32:06.249 --> 32:08.749
Blake: We're looking at everyone
from organized crime to ex-cons.

32:08.751 --> 32:11.836
Hotch: If it was an ex-con,
the target would likely be more specific,

32:11.838 --> 32:13.203
like the arresting officer.

32:13.205 --> 32:16.056
Guys, I think the 5-digit
number Daniel's reciting

32:16.058 --> 32:18.008
is a police badge number.

32:19.978 --> 32:21.378
Garcia.
Talk to me.

32:21.380 --> 32:24.732
Run 53699 against
a list of Chicago P.D.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.234
Running it as fast
as bytes will carry.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.936
53699...I got a hit!

32:28.938 --> 32:32.072
53699 is the badge number
to a former officer

32:32.074 --> 32:33.140
Wayne Gulino.

32:33.142 --> 32:35.526
Everything we've worked for
all these years,

32:35.528 --> 32:38.863
it's come to this moment.

32:51.092 --> 32:52.843
Make me proud.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.745
Garcia: Gulino was
an Air Force sergeant.

32:54.747 --> 32:56.747
He served two tours
in Iraq.

32:56.749 --> 32:59.249
When he came home
he joined the Chicago P.D.

32:59.251 --> 33:02.887
7 years ago today,
he and his partner George Scotman

33:02.889 --> 33:04.722
had their badges stripped

33:04.724 --> 33:08.091
for brutally coercing
confessions out of suspects.

33:08.093 --> 33:09.810
Ohh!

33:09.812 --> 33:11.078
Ohh!

33:12.447 --> 33:14.949
A fellow rookie officer
filed a report.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.067
That led to an internal
affairs investigation.

33:17.069 --> 33:18.786
And that rookie cop
who blew the whistle

33:18.788 --> 33:21.405
was none other than
one Detective Mark Reyes.

33:21.407 --> 33:23.324
Hotch: All right, Garcia, send us
everything you've got

33:23.326 --> 33:24.875
on Gulino and the partner.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.794
Gulino was defined by his badge,

33:26.796 --> 33:29.497
and when he felt wronged
by his own kind,

33:29.499 --> 33:31.482
the love turned to hate.

33:31.484 --> 33:33.050
Blake, go talk to Reyes,
see what you can find out.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.468
The rest of us will go
to Gulino's residence.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.971
Detective, can I speak
with you for a moment?

33:36.973 --> 33:38.672
Sure.

33:38.674 --> 33:40.174
Any new leads?

33:40.176 --> 33:41.725
I need you to tell me
everything you know

33:41.727 --> 33:43.310
about officer
Wayne Gulino.

33:43.312 --> 33:47.648
It says here that Gulino's partner
Scotman died 4 years ago of cancer.

33:47.650 --> 33:50.851
Brandon and Vincent were abducted
4 weeks after Scotman died.

33:50.853 --> 33:52.319
His death had to be
the trigger.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.488
Morgan: And today marks
the seventh anniversary

33:54.490 --> 33:57.140
of when Gulino was
let go from the force.

33:57.142 --> 33:58.659
Hey, has anyone
seen Peterson?

33:58.661 --> 34:01.412
Officer: Yeah, I think
he's down in evidence.

34:02.480 --> 34:06.166
JJ: Ok, so he chose today
to launch his attacks,

34:06.168 --> 34:08.452
make his big statement
against the police force.

34:08.454 --> 34:09.753
And by now he knows
that we have Daniel,

34:09.755 --> 34:11.839
so it's only a matter of time
before we find him.

34:11.841 --> 34:15.042
I'm looking for
Detective Mark Reyes.

34:15.043 --> 34:17.828
Officer: Attention, eyes up.
We got a code 10.

34:40.041 --> 34:42.592
I'm Detective Reyes.

34:42.594 --> 34:46.146
Officer Gulino
has a message for you.

34:54.856 --> 34:56.556
You don't want
to do this.

34:56.558 --> 34:58.275
Shoot me and this
whole place goes up.

34:58.277 --> 35:00.361
Everybody holster
your weapons.

35:00.363 --> 35:01.996
Holster your weapons.

35:16.294 --> 35:18.745
My name's Jennifer.
What's your name?

35:18.747 --> 35:21.632
My name is Stephanie
Lawford. I'm a soldier.

35:21.634 --> 35:24.134
53699.

35:24.136 --> 35:25.636
JJ: I understand
you have your orders,

35:25.638 --> 35:28.272
but can we talk
just a moment?

35:28.274 --> 35:30.924
It's time for you to hear
the words of a true American hero.

35:30.926 --> 35:32.414
Hero?
Officer Wayne Gulino.

35:32.415 --> 35:34.769
What kind of hero
sends children to fight his battles?

35:34.770 --> 35:35.865
This is directed at my former

35:35.890 --> 35:37.482
brothers-in-arms,
the Chicago police department,

35:37.483 --> 35:39.483
who betrayed me,
and in doing so,

35:39.485 --> 35:41.452
betrayed the very honor code
you all swore to uphold....

35:41.454 --> 35:43.770
A hero isn't someone who abuses
their power and hurts innocent people.

35:43.772 --> 35:45.823
Because of your reprehensible actions,
my late partner,

35:45.825 --> 35:48.275
the brave officer
George Scotman died...

35:48.277 --> 35:50.127
You're just his patsy.
You mean nothing to him.

35:50.129 --> 35:51.314
As an unsung hero, without
Sweetie, you're just a number.

35:51.339 --> 35:51.796
the honor he deserved.

35:51.797 --> 35:54.498
I can assure you,
our legacy will live on forever.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.300
This isn't a legacy.
Gulino is a coward.

35:56.302 --> 35:58.636
Everything we worked for in our careers
had led me to this moment.

35:58.638 --> 36:00.888
Now that you've had
a taste of our righteous vengeance,

36:00.890 --> 36:03.590
be warned,
this is just the beginning.

36:04.876 --> 36:06.894
Suspect down!

36:06.896 --> 36:07.978
Bomb still active!

36:07.980 --> 36:09.963
Call the bomb squad!

36:10.849 --> 36:13.800
Stay back. Stay back.

36:20.992 --> 36:22.976
All right, thanks, Garcia.

36:24.946 --> 36:27.831
Apparently Stephanie had been
missing for a little over 6 years.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.783
She's been with him
the longest.

36:29.785 --> 36:31.618
Maybe he thought
having a maternal figure

36:31.620 --> 36:34.004
would help condition
the boys faster.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.126
That was Hotch. They searched
both locations for Gulino. He's gone.

36:39.128 --> 36:41.828
Stephanie was just
a distraction to buy him some time.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.347
Well,
this isn't over yet.

36:43.349 --> 36:45.665
He said it himself--
this is only the beginning.

36:45.667 --> 36:47.834
Well, if he continues
in military fashion,

36:47.836 --> 36:49.887
he'll withdraw from
the failed mission and regroup.

36:49.889 --> 36:52.172
The question is,
where's his foxhole?

36:52.174 --> 36:55.359
"My late partner, the brave
officer George Scotman,

36:55.361 --> 36:56.810
died as an unsung hero."

36:56.812 --> 37:00.781
This is as much about
his partner as it is about Gulino.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.682
Yeah, baby girl, send us
the last known address

37:02.684 --> 37:05.819
for Gulino's partner,
officer Scotman.

37:32.180 --> 37:33.814
Don't move.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.649
Put your hands
where I can see them.

37:35.651 --> 37:36.850
[Siren]

37:36.852 --> 37:38.268
Put 'em up.

37:58.873 --> 38:01.925
Are you all right?

38:01.927 --> 38:02.960
Yeah.

38:02.962 --> 38:04.211
Come on.

38:10.718 --> 38:12.752
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:12.754 --> 38:14.688
Anything you say
can and will be use against you

38:14.690 --> 38:16.056
in a court of law.

38:16.058 --> 38:17.891
You have the right
to an attorney.

38:17.893 --> 38:19.276
If you can't afford
an attorney,

38:19.278 --> 38:21.261
one will be provided
to you by the court.

38:21.263 --> 38:23.814
Do you understand
these rights that I've just read you?

38:25.817 --> 38:27.985
Come here.

38:27.987 --> 38:29.536
There you go.

38:29.538 --> 38:30.871
What's your name?

38:30.873 --> 38:34.158
My name is Cameron Patterson.

38:35.210 --> 38:37.044
I'm a soldier.

38:37.046 --> 38:40.631
53699.

38:40.633 --> 38:43.550
Is that what
he told you to say?

38:43.552 --> 38:48.305
Cameron, you don't
have to say that ever again. Ok?

38:48.307 --> 38:51.091
We're gonna take you
to your mom and dad.

38:56.981 --> 39:00.684
JJ: "The greater the power,
the more dangerous the abuse."

39:00.686 --> 39:03.020
Edmund Burke.

39:08.827 --> 39:10.077
I know, Mom.

39:10.079 --> 39:11.778
You're right.
You're right,

39:11.780 --> 39:13.947
the least I could
have done is call.

39:13.949 --> 39:17.951
It--it won't happen again,
I swear.

39:17.953 --> 39:20.287
I love you, too.

39:20.289 --> 39:21.988
[Knock on door]

39:21.990 --> 39:24.091
It's open.

39:24.093 --> 39:28.295
[Romantic music playing]

39:30.765 --> 39:32.599
Wow.

39:33.468 --> 39:35.552
Huh. Wow. Um...

39:35.554 --> 39:37.037
What's going on?

39:37.039 --> 39:40.307
Hey. We've only been dating
a few months,

39:40.309 --> 39:42.442
so I know I didn't
miss an anniversary.

39:42.444 --> 39:46.680
I just wanted to do
something special for you.

39:49.284 --> 39:51.285
How did you know
I was going to be home?

39:51.287 --> 39:52.953
Sit.

39:54.355 --> 39:56.022
Penelope sent me a text

39:56.024 --> 39:57.524
when you guys left Chicago.

39:57.526 --> 39:58.858
Oh, she did?

39:58.860 --> 40:00.994
Mm-hmm.

40:02.213 --> 40:04.248
And you did all
of this for me?

40:04.250 --> 40:05.966
Yes.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.200
And...

40:07.202 --> 40:09.920
I made you...

40:13.174 --> 40:15.309
This.
Whoa.

40:15.311 --> 40:17.861
Which is why takeout
will be here in 20 minutes.

40:17.863 --> 40:19.062
I hope you like Indian.

40:19.064 --> 40:22.849
Anything is better
than whatever that is.

40:22.851 --> 40:24.601
[Both laughing]

40:24.603 --> 40:26.436
I know.
It's kind of bad.

40:26.438 --> 40:28.155
Ooh.

40:28.157 --> 40:30.524
[Both laughing]

40:30.526 --> 40:33.560
How was your day?
Did you save some lives?

40:33.562 --> 40:34.728
Mm-hmm.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.413
We both did.

40:36.415 --> 40:38.532
Yeah, we did.

40:38.534 --> 40:40.117
So, um...

40:40.119 --> 40:43.370

for the next 20 minutes?
