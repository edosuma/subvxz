WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:05.087
Okay, okay, I checked.

00:05.255 --> 00:09.133
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,
cinnamon stick...

00:09.300 --> 00:13.137
...chamomile, mint medley,
blackberry and, uh...

00:13.304 --> 00:15.889
Oh, wait, there's one more, um...
Lemon soother.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.061
You're not the guy that asked
for the tea, are you?

00:21.688 --> 00:22.896
Okay.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.826
Mail call. Rachel Green, bunk seven.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.787
Thank you.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.874
Oh, cool. A free sample of coffee.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.960
Oh, good, because where else
would we get any? Ha, ha.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.923
Oh, right.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.926
- Oh, great.
- What is it?

01:34.719 --> 01:36.678
Country club newsletter.

01:36.846 --> 01:41.600
My mother sends me
the engagement notices for inspiration.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.061
Oh, my God.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.396
Oh, my God. It's Barry and Mindy.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.482
- Barry, who you almost...?
- Barry, who I almost...

01:48.650 --> 01:50.192
- Mindy, your maid of...
- My maid of...

01:50.360 --> 01:52.986
Let me see. That's Mindy?

01:53.154 --> 01:54.446
Wow, she is pretty.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.117
Lucky...

01:59.452 --> 02:02.121
...to have had a friend like you.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.502
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice. Come on.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.630
Good boy. Good bye.
Come here, give me the rice.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.382
Thank you. Good boy.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.718
Well, I see he's mastered the difference
between "bring me the"...

02:16.886 --> 02:18.762
...and "pee in the."

02:21.432 --> 02:24.309
"Bring me the" and... Rach?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.270
- What?
- Hi.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.856
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.732
This is so stupid.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.193
- I mean, I gave Barry up, right?
- Mm.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.279
I should be happy for them.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.698
I am. I'm happy for them.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.449
- Really?
- No.

02:39.617 --> 02:44.413
Oh. Oh, I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.790
Whoa, what, uh, ha, ha...

02:47.292 --> 02:50.460
What happened to, uh,
"Forget relationships.

02:50.628 --> 02:54.339
I'm done with men"?
The whole, uh, penis embargo?

02:58.094 --> 03:00.095
Oh, I don't know.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.264
I guess it's not about no guys.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.766
- It's about the right guy, you know?
- Hmm.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.478
With Barry, it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.105
- Mm.
- You know, with Paolo...

03:10.273 --> 03:11.815
...that's all there was, was heat.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.235
And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual...

03:15.403 --> 03:17.696
Right, right. I got it.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.865
I was there.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.451
I mean, do you think
you can ever have both?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.078
You know?
Someone who's like your best friend...

03:25.246 --> 03:27.623
...but then also can make
your toes curl.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.291
Yes, yes.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.419
Yes. Yes, I do. I really do.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.171
Uh, in fact, it's funny.

03:34.339 --> 03:38.383
Very often, someone who
you wouldn't think could...

03:39.010 --> 03:40.886
...curl your toes...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.472
...might just be the one who...

03:43.681 --> 03:44.765
Hi.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.225
- Gets interrupted. Hi.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.185
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.020
- Oh, so wonderful.
- Oh, it was so good.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.106
- Suck fest.
- Total chick flick.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.319
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies...

03:57.487 --> 03:59.821
...with, like, you know, like,
guns and bombs...

03:59.989 --> 04:02.282
...and, like, buses going really fast.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.537
Hey, I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie...

04:07.705 --> 04:09.456
...just so long as there's a little nudity.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.876
- There was nudity.
- I meant female nudity.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.797
All right, I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.675
Hugh. Hugh Grant.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.679
All right, I've got to go. Ahem.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.430
Come on, Marcel. Come on.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.434
Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.437
They're still just friends, right?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.318
And I will see you tomorrow.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.571
That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow
at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?

04:41.739 --> 04:44.616
Hang on, hang on.
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.661
Please, Aunt Monica, please? Ha, ha.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.871
Oh, unclench.
You're not even gonna be here.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.298
I can't believe we're having this discussion.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.634
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.638
Don't you think if things were gonna happen
with Rachel, they would've happened?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.349
I'm telling you,
she said she's looking for a relationship...

05:09.517 --> 05:11.310
...with someone exactly like me.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.186
She really said that?

05:13.354 --> 05:15.564
Well, I added the "exactly like me" part.

05:16.816 --> 05:21.194
But she said she's looking for someone.
And someone is gonna be there tonight.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.696
"Tonight" tonight?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.907
Well, I think it's perfect.
It's just gonna be the two of us.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.453
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.292
I can't remember the last time
I got a girl to take care of my monkey.

05:39.672 --> 05:43.842
Anyway, you know, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine...

05:44.010 --> 05:47.554
...go over there and, uh, try to woo her.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.640
Hey, you know what you should do?

05:50.808 --> 05:54.353
You should take her back to the 1890s
when that phrase was last used.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.525
If you keep this up...

06:00.693 --> 06:03.278
...you'll be finished with this sucker
by the end of the week.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.656
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.242
Now, she used to be a man.

06:09.410 --> 06:13.038
Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven.
We hate her.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.956
We're glad she's dying.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.751
And then... What? Marcel.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.338
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You know you're not supposed to...

06:21.506 --> 06:24.299
Whoa, whoa.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.552
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.847
Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.225
Oh, God.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.894
Oh.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.357
Sorry, Barry.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.526
A little engagement gift.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.570
I'm sure you didn't register for that.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.163
Who died? Who died?

06:55.748 --> 06:59.292
Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over.
Oh!

06:59.460 --> 07:03.880
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because...

07:04.048 --> 07:07.008
Marcel? Marcel? Marc...?

07:08.886 --> 07:11.304
- How could you lose him?
- I don't know, I don't know.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.099
We were watching TV,
and then he pooped in Monica's shoe...

07:14.267 --> 07:18.061
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

07:18.229 --> 07:21.148
I don't know. The left one.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.441
Which ones?

07:22.608 --> 07:26.736
Oh, those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.489
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.284
Whoa, oh.
Why is the air in here so negative?

07:34.745 --> 07:37.706
- Rachel lost Marcel.
- Oh, no. How?

07:37.874 --> 07:40.041
- He pooped in my shoe.
- Which one?

07:40.209 --> 07:42.502
Those cute little black ones
I wear all the time.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.671
No, which one? Ha, ha.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.965
The right or left?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.093
Because the left one is lucky.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.845
Come on, you guys.
What am I gonna do?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.014
All right, all right, all right.
You're a monkey...

07:54.182 --> 07:55.849
...you're loose in the city.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.809
Where do you go?

07:58.394 --> 07:59.769
Okay, it's his first time out...

07:59.937 --> 08:03.148
...so he's probably gonna want
to do some of the touristy things.

08:05.276 --> 08:09.070
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.574
Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.035
He's gonna be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.662
Start with the building.
You take the first and second floor.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.539
Phoebe and I will take third and fourth.

08:19.707 --> 08:20.999
Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.793
Okay, you stay here
and just wait by the phone.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.422
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.008
Does anybody want to trade?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.975
What do you want?

08:39.143 --> 08:42.395
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

08:42.563 --> 08:45.398
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

08:45.566 --> 08:46.566
No.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.277
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle
in the hall?

08:49.445 --> 08:51.112
I wasn't ready for it.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.114
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.201
I saw Regis Philbin once.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.912
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.165
You owe me a waffle.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.254
Okay, he's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...

09:07.421 --> 09:11.591
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.094
Okay, thanks.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.888
- Hi.
- Hey. How did it go today?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.891
- Oh, great. It went great. Really great.
- Yeah.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.143
- Hey, is that wine?
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.812
You, uh, want some?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.772
- Oh, I would love some.
- Yeah.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.441
But you know what? You know what?
Let's not drink it here.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.152
I'm feeling kind of crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.908
Uh, okay. Yeah.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.996
We could do that. But before we head off
to the murder capital of the Northeast...

09:42.039 --> 09:45.250
...I was, uh, kind of wanted
to run something by you.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.670
You know how we were,
you know, talking before...

09:48.838 --> 09:51.131
...about relationships and stuff, well...

09:51.299 --> 09:55.302
- Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this.
- Okay, quick and painful.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.604
Oh, God.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.648
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.150
Ross, please don't hate me.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.235
Oh, what? What? What?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.990
You know Marcel?

10:17.783 --> 10:20.201
- Yeah?
- Well, ahem.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.997
I kind of, uh... I kind of lost him.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.722
I can't believe this.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.476
I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.852
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.146
You know what?
I guess it's partially my fault.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.649
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.818
I should have started you off with, like,
a pen or a pencil.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.446
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.573
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got...

11:01.744 --> 11:03.787
- Who is it?
- Animal Control.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.457
- See, I've even got Animal Control.
- You called Animal Control?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.459
Uh-huh.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.879
Why? Do you not like them?

11:14.465 --> 11:19.886
Heh. Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.557
I'm not allowed to have him in the city.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.977
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

11:28.145 --> 11:32.273
Okay, well, now, see,
you never ever, ever told us that.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.528
That's right, because I didn't expect you
we're gonna invite them to the apartment.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.326
Hi. Thanks for coming.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.911
Somebody called about a monkey?

11:45.079 --> 11:49.290
Oh. Oh, you know what?
That was a complete misunderstanding.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.876
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.461
- It turned out it was a hat.
- Cat.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.380
Cat. What did I say?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.382
Hi. We checked
the third and fourth floor.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.092
- No one's seen Marcel.
- Marcel?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.427
My uncle Marcel.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.138
Oh, is that who the monkey's
named after?

12:03.305 --> 12:04.514
Okay.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.934
Are you aware that possession
of an illegal exotic is punishable...

12:08.102 --> 12:11.479
...by up to two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.106
Oh, my God.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.734
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?

12:21.365 --> 12:25.910
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about
saying things quietly to yourself first?

12:26.746 --> 12:29.205
Yes, but there isn't always time.

12:32.668 --> 12:37.380
Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Um, have a seat.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.924
First of all, we haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.011
Oh, my God, you are.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.597
- And you're Rachel Green.
- Yeah.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.058
Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?

12:49.477 --> 12:52.353
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

12:52.521 --> 12:56.566
Oh! Luisa. Oh, my God.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.943
Monica. It's Luisa!

12:59.111 --> 13:01.154
Luisa. From homeroom.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.822
Yes!

13:03.449 --> 13:06.326
- You have no idea who I am, do you?
- No.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.161
Not at all.

13:08.329 --> 13:12.582
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.252
Would it have been so hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...

13:16.420 --> 13:18.421
...or "Nice overalls"?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.470
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.557
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.187
But you. What a bitch.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.315
What?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.901
You know what? Be that as it may.

13:40.069 --> 13:44.364
You think you could you help us out here
on that monkey thing, for old times' sake?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.407
Go, Bobcats.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.911
I could. But I won't.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.414
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.042
Da, da, da

13:58.671 --> 14:00.171
Sorry.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.468
Marcel?

14:05.636 --> 14:06.970
Marcel?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.180
- Marcel?
- Marcel?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.938
Hi, can I help you?

14:21.402 --> 14:25.321
Uh, we're kind of having an emergency,
and, ahem, we were looking for something.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.200
- A monkey.
- Yes, have you seen any?

14:29.368 --> 14:32.078
No. No, I haven't seen a monkey.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.955
Do you know anything
about fixing radiators?

14:34.373 --> 14:37.584
Sure, sure. Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

14:38.168 --> 14:41.379
- Of course.
- Oh. Then, no.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.302
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum in here?

14:47.469 --> 14:50.096
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.265
Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.935
Um, we may not know
about radiators, per se...

14:56.103 --> 14:58.104
...but we do have a certain amount
of expertise...

14:58.272 --> 15:00.773
...in the heating and cooling milieu.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.821
Uh, weren't we kind of in the middle
of something here?

15:06.989 --> 15:10.408
Yes, but these women are very hot
and they need our help.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.578
And they're very hot.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.707
We can't, all right?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.375
We're sorry.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.546
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised we'd find this monkey.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.966
If you see him, he's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.678
So if we could get some pictures of you,
you'd really be helping us out.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.523
Okay, from now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.109
- Marcel?
- Marcel.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.028
Marcel?

15:47.279 --> 15:50.865
Marcel?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.617
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.744
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.412
- What is it?
- Oh.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.248
Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.627
Look, Phoebe.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.462
Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel. Come here.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.798
- Oh, come here, Marcel.
- Step aside, ladies.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.552
- What are you gonna do?
- Just a small tranquilizer.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.779
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!

16:29.947 --> 16:31.823
- Damn.
- Are you okay?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.450
Oh, yeah, I think so.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.411
Oh.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.414
Huh.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.541
Whoa.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.377
Oh, gosh.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.929
Marcel. Marcel.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.390
This is ridiculous.
We've been all over the neighborhood.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.142
He's gone. He's just gone.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.478
- Ross, you don't know that.
- Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.981
He doesn't know the Village.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.483
And now I have a broken foot. Oh, my...

17:07.651 --> 17:10.111
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.487
Thank you very much.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.699
Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.286
What do you want me to do? Huh?
You want me to break my foot too?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.454
Here, I'm gonna break my foot right now.
Ow!

17:20.622 --> 17:24.166
Oh, my God. There, are you happy now?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.211
Yeah, yeah. You know,
now that you kicked the sign...

17:27.378 --> 17:31.215
...hey, ha, ha,
I don't miss Marcel anymore.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.845
You know, it's not like
I did this on purpose.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.389
No, no, no. No, no.
This is just vintage Rachel.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.142
I mean, things just sort of happen
around you.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.687
I mean, you're off in Rachel Land,
doing your Rachel thing...

17:44.855 --> 17:49.776
...totally oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and...

17:49.943 --> 17:52.153
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Ross.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.738
- Forget it, okay?
- Ross.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.656
What? What?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.745
Hey, banana man.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.669
Oh, this is so intense.

18:08.837 --> 18:13.716
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.515
Hi. Did you order some bananas?

18:20.682 --> 18:23.101
- What about it?
- Give me my monkey back.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.393
I don't have a monkey.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.438
- Then what's with all the bananas?
- Potassium.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.777
Marcel? Marcel.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.114
Okay, where is he? Where is he?
Marcel? Marcel?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.118
Marcel.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.703
What have you done to him?

18:42.871 --> 18:45.414
That's my monkey. That's Patty.
Patty the monkey.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.960
Are you insane?

18:49.128 --> 18:52.380
- Come here, Marcel. Come on.
- Come here, Patty.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.382
Come here, Marcel.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.883
Come here, Patty.

18:56.051 --> 18:59.053
Here, monkey. Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.930
Gotcha.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.392
- Okay, give me my monkey back.
- That's my monkey.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.644
You're gonna have to take this up
with the judge.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.063
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.190
You can send it back whenever.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.484
- All right, I want my monkey.
- No.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.696
- Oh, come on, Luisa.
- Sorry, prom queen.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.116
You had to be a bitch in high school,
you couldn't have been fat.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.121
All right, look, in high school,
I was the prom queen...

19:25.289 --> 19:28.666
...and I was the homecoming queen
and the class president and you...

19:28.834 --> 19:30.751
...were also there.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.420
Look, if you take this monkey...

19:32.588 --> 19:35.673
...I will lose one of the most
important people in my life.

19:35.841 --> 19:40.052
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.472
Come on, Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.266
Take it.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.188
No.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.647
All right.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.525
Well, then how about I call
your supervisor and I tell her...

19:54.693 --> 19:57.570
...that you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.788
Hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally,
won't it?

20:07.956 --> 20:10.958
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

20:11.126 --> 20:15.129
You know, with the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.468
Listen...

20:20.969 --> 20:23.596
I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.
You know, I just...

20:23.764 --> 20:26.933
No, Ross, come on. No, no. It was my fault.
I almost lost your...

20:27.100 --> 20:29.143
No, no. Yeah, but you were the one
who got him back.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.811
You know, you were great.

20:35.025 --> 20:38.861
Hey, we still have that bottle of wine.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.447
Are you in the mood for, uh...

20:41.615 --> 20:42.949
...something grape?

20:43.116 --> 20:46.953
- Sure, that would be good.
- All right, uh...

20:51.792 --> 20:53.084
Oh.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.548
The, uh... The neighbors
must be vacuuming.

21:04.596 --> 21:09.308
Well, ah, as long as we're here...

21:11.019 --> 21:13.938
...and not on the subject, um, ahem...

21:14.231 --> 21:16.607
I was thinking about, uh...

21:18.819 --> 21:21.821
...how mad we got at each other before.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.036
And, um, I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we...

21:29.621 --> 21:31.455
- Rachel?
- Barry?

21:31.623 --> 21:35.167
I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.088
- I'm still in love with you.
- Oh!

21:44.011 --> 21:47.513
We have got to start locking that door.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.107
This is me in The Sound of Music.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.568
- You see the von Trapp kids?
- No.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.653
That's because I'm in front of them.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.448
Yeah, I thought that was an alp.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.117
Well, high school
was not my favorite time.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.411
I don't know. I loved high school,
you know?

22:10.620 --> 22:14.498
It was just, like, four years
of parties and dating and sex and...

22:14.666 --> 22:17.918
Yeah, well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.464
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.094
Gosh, doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

22:29.514 --> 22:31.515
Oh, oh, oh.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.726
Oh, my butt cheek is waking up.
