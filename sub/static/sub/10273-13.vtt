WEBVTT

00:01.616 --> 00:03.854
<i>Previously on The Americans...</i>

00:04.688 --> 00:06.238
<i>Zhukov is dead?</i>
<i>Who did it?</i>

00:06.323 --> 00:08.023
The CIA Director of Planning

00:08.074 --> 00:09.959
for the Soviet Union,
Richard Patterson.

00:10.026 --> 00:11.777
You gave me
Richard Patterson's name.

00:11.862 --> 00:13.262
I let him go.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.431
You're not the only one
who loved Zhukov.

00:15.499 --> 00:18.167
I don't believe you ever had
a relationship with Zhukov.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.803
I can help you,
and one day you will help me.

00:20.871 --> 00:23.372
- Exfiltration.
- One step at a time.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.602
We're just starting out here.

00:24.623 --> 00:26.926
_

00:27.046 --> 00:28.277
_

00:28.278 --> 00:29.645
You don't
want to be married to me?

00:29.713 --> 00:31.280
I don't think the Centre
would even care.

00:31.348 --> 00:33.282
We know that we're looking for

00:33.350 --> 00:35.317
a Caucasian man and woman,
a couple.

00:35.385 --> 00:36.552
I recruited somebody--

00:36.620 --> 00:38.220
a colonel
in Air Force Intelligence

00:38.288 --> 00:40.556
who works in the anti-ballistic
missile program.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.858
This colonel
is way up the food chain.

00:42.926 --> 00:44.493
A meeting has been set.

00:44.561 --> 00:45.995
A trap is always a possibility.

00:46.062 --> 00:47.963
But in this case,
it's worth the risk.

00:48.031 --> 00:49.064
There's one move we could make.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.066
We put a bug in Gaad's office.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.334
Martha could do it.

00:52.402 --> 00:54.703
No knock on your charms there,
Romeo,

00:54.771 --> 00:56.205
but there's no way
she'll go for that.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.408
I pronounce you man and wife.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.243
You and I were
never really married.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.479
I know they're
just words people say.

01:03.547 --> 01:05.313
Do you think things would've
been different between us

01:05.382 --> 01:06.982
if we would've said them?

01:08.385 --> 01:09.718
Prince was arrested.

01:09.786 --> 01:11.303
Failure to pay child support.

01:11.388 --> 01:13.305
How many days before the feds

01:13.390 --> 01:15.558
start looking into an incarcerated
Department Of Defense employee

01:15.625 --> 01:16.992
with a high-level
security clearance

01:17.060 --> 01:18.727
and a felony charge
hanging over his head?

01:18.795 --> 01:20.930
Even if the meeting wasn't
a setup before,

01:20.997 --> 01:23.599
it's insane to go into it now
with Prince in custody.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.467
He could be broken
with a feather duster.

01:27.104 --> 01:30.239
I don't understand.
It's just child support.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.607
I know.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.743
And, look,
I'm new to Counterintelligence,

01:33.810 --> 01:35.311
but would you believe

01:35.379 --> 01:37.747
that they've actually had
foreign intelligence services

01:37.814 --> 01:40.149
target people
who are behind on child support?

01:40.217 --> 01:42.318
I mean,
where these foreign countries

01:42.386 --> 01:44.954
- even get that information,
I have no idea. - Jesus.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.956
Anyway, that's how
a guy like you ends up here.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.926
- I'm not saying it's fair.
- Yeah.

01:51.495 --> 01:53.629
I'll probably lose my security
clearance over this--

01:53.697 --> 01:55.765
getting arrested.

01:55.832 --> 01:57.099
You don't have to worry

01:57.167 --> 01:59.335
about your security clearance,
Sandford.

01:59.403 --> 02:01.737
I'm gonna
get this all cleared up,

02:01.805 --> 02:03.472
have you out of here
in an hour.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.907
Sound good?

02:08.512 --> 02:10.812
Something is wrong
with that guy.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.100
I don't know what exactly,
but he's holding back.

02:14.184 --> 02:16.402
You want to go back in,
push harder?

02:16.486 --> 02:19.071
You know, I told him
he'd be out of here in an hour.

02:19.156 --> 02:21.424
Let's just let him sit there.
No one goes in.

02:21.491 --> 02:23.626
At some point, he's gonna
start shouting at the glass

02:23.694 --> 02:28.030
that he wants to talk.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.092 --> 02:42.128
Oh, I love you.
Oh, I love you.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.123
Martha,
I will never forget tonight.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.125
Me either.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.196
My husband.

03:02.899 --> 03:04.366
My Clark.

03:11.207 --> 03:12.875
Do you like wallpaper?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.877
Huh?

03:14.945 --> 03:18.681
Well, I know you won't be here
seven nights a week,

03:18.748 --> 03:22.484
but you'll be here a lot,
and we're making a home.

03:22.552 --> 03:24.820
I want it
to feel like yours, too.

03:24.888 --> 03:29.458
So, I thought
we might redecorate a bit.

03:29.526 --> 03:33.028
I think this place is perfect.

03:33.096 --> 03:35.230
Mm. Mm.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.276
I ordered you eggs florentine.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.820
Are you ready to meet with
the colonel tomorrow?

03:57.887 --> 04:00.189
I'm ready.

04:00.256 --> 04:02.691
But when someone
appears suddenly,

04:02.759 --> 04:05.995
promises big intel,
and sets their own meeting,

04:06.062 --> 04:07.696
I worry about a setup.

04:07.764 --> 04:10.866
Do you have any new information
on the Prince situation?

04:10.934 --> 04:12.768
Our contact in the DC Police

04:12.836 --> 04:15.337
says he's been moved
into federal custody.

04:17.140 --> 04:18.741
You have a right to be worried,

04:18.808 --> 04:20.409
but this is
what we're here for.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.511
I know what we're here for.

04:22.579 --> 04:24.546
Good.

04:24.614 --> 04:28.350
Another thing--
we had an intercept last night.

04:28.418 --> 04:30.085
There's going to be a meeting

04:30.153 --> 04:32.054
between Weinberger
and James Baker

04:32.122 --> 04:33.722
at Weinberger's home office.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.624
It was set up in a hurry

04:35.692 --> 04:39.461
and flagged "Top Priority"
by the White House.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.963
The Centre's worried

04:41.031 --> 04:42.865
that Reagan may be planning
a covert strike

04:42.932 --> 04:46.301
against a Spetsnaz detachment
in Nicaragua.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.304
They wouldn't discuss it
on the record in the Pentagon,

04:49.372 --> 04:52.374
but they want Philip to pick up
the recording of the bug

04:52.442 --> 04:53.709
and get it to them ASAP.

04:53.777 --> 04:55.194
I will let him know.

04:55.278 --> 04:56.812
They also informed me
that you and Philip

04:56.880 --> 05:00.082
radioed a request
for my reassignment.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.217
Well, that couldn't
have come as a shock.

05:02.285 --> 05:05.120
I had to fill out
an "officer in the field"

05:05.188 --> 05:07.489
special-request
assessment form.

05:09.025 --> 05:11.427
It has 27 sections.

05:11.494 --> 05:15.731
Well, I guess
your job can be dangerous, too.

05:15.799 --> 05:20.969
My point was, you've been
in the field too long.

05:21.037 --> 05:23.672
You've lost touch
with both your basic obligations

05:23.740 --> 05:25.974
and the central rules
and regulations

05:26.042 --> 05:28.243
that make
this organization function.

05:28.311 --> 05:32.581
It's happened before
with officers in your position,

05:32.649 --> 05:34.416
and it can be remedied.

05:34.484 --> 05:37.653
I'm sure they'll send
someone else to remedy it.

05:37.721 --> 05:39.488
Don't be sure.

05:39.556 --> 05:44.259
I've been serving faithfully
much longer than you, my dear.

05:44.327 --> 05:45.828
I told them
they're in danger of losing you.

05:45.895 --> 05:50.866
And whether you see it
or not, I'm right.

05:50.934 --> 05:54.303
I'm surprised
they gave you this job,

05:54.370 --> 05:57.206
when you have no understanding
of people at all.

05:57.273 --> 06:02.277
I know you better
than you know yourself.

06:02.345 --> 06:04.847
Mm.

06:07.183 --> 06:11.120
And you don't know <i>me</i> at all.

06:11.187 --> 06:14.690
Well, you should be
heading home soon.

06:14.758 --> 06:16.892
I'd stay out of my way
if I were you.

06:31.791 --> 06:34.159
The meeting tomorrow
with the colonel is on.

06:34.244 --> 06:35.677
Prince is in federal custody.

06:35.745 --> 06:37.646
If it wasn't a setup
in the first place,

06:37.714 --> 06:39.915
what are the odds
of him keeping his mouth shut?

06:42.952 --> 06:45.254
- I listened to the Gaad bug last night.
- And?

06:45.321 --> 06:48.190
Three times yesterday somebody
knocked on Gaad's office door

06:48.258 --> 06:50.325
to say they had an update,
and three times he said,

06:50.393 --> 06:51.827
"into the vault,"
and then footsteps

06:51.895 --> 06:53.362
as they walked
out of the office.

06:53.429 --> 06:55.697
Could be them setting us up
with the colonel.

06:55.765 --> 06:58.700
Or could be them running any one
of their other operations.

06:58.768 --> 07:01.937
- Yeah.
- If this goes bad,

07:02.005 --> 07:04.606
you need to be out of town
somewhere with the kids.

07:04.674 --> 07:08.877
It goes like this--
they let the meeting run

07:08.945 --> 07:11.046
so they have tapes on me
for my trial.

07:11.114 --> 07:12.848
Then they swoop in, arrest me.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.716
Maybe they rip the disguise
off me then,

07:14.784 --> 07:16.618
maybe wait
till the interrogation later.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.687
Normally,
we'd have a couple of hours,

07:18.755 --> 07:20.455
maybe days, before they ID me.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.592
But now we have till Stan Beeman
gets his first look at me.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.228
You have to be already gone.
Get the kids to Canada.

07:26.296 --> 07:28.063
Contact the Rezidentura there.

07:28.131 --> 07:30.032
That's fine,
but you have it backwards.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.366
I'll meet the colonel.

07:31.434 --> 07:32.968
You take the kids,
get ready to move.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.636
You'll be doing something else.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.139
There's a meeting
at Weinberger's tomorrow.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.107
The Centre needs the tape.

07:39.175 --> 07:41.577
Okay. So, you grab the tape,
pick up the kids from school,

07:41.644 --> 07:43.579
wait someplace safe
while I meet the colonel.

07:50.475 --> 07:54.423
I know what you're trying to do,
but listen to me.

07:54.490 --> 07:56.491
If one of us is going down

07:56.559 --> 07:59.294
and one of us
is staying with the kids,

07:59.362 --> 08:05.300
Philip, after everything...
it should be you.

08:05.368 --> 08:08.103
- That's not true.
- I <i>want</i> it to be you.

08:08.171 --> 08:10.439
You're the one they want.

08:10.506 --> 08:13.308
The one they understand.
Don't argue with me.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.110
Just say yes.
It's for all of us.

08:15.178 --> 08:16.945
No.

08:17.013 --> 08:20.616
The colonel is my mission,
from <i>my</i> agent.

08:20.683 --> 08:22.217
It's what the Centre ordered.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.898
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

08:57.353 --> 09:00.353
The bug's receiver is in that car.
We think, in the trunk.

09:00.354 --> 09:01.754
How do we know it's that car?

09:01.822 --> 09:03.489
We turned the bug on
for two minutes,

09:03.557 --> 09:05.591
traced its signal,
and that's where it landed.

09:05.659 --> 09:07.260
How do they listen to it?

09:07.327 --> 09:08.995
They either sit in the car,

09:09.062 --> 09:11.264
or they pick up a recording
and take it home with them.

09:11.331 --> 09:12.999
What, they just
leave the car there?

09:13.066 --> 09:14.967
Probably switch it out
from time to time.

09:15.035 --> 09:16.602
They turn it on remotely

09:16.670 --> 09:18.537
when they want to record
something from the study,

09:18.605 --> 09:20.539
then come by and pick it up.

09:20.607 --> 09:22.717
Good.

09:27.865 --> 09:30.957
_

09:33.056 --> 09:38.732
_

09:39.598 --> 09:43.142

09:43.424 --> 09:45.519

09:46.427 --> 09:48.145

09:51.321 --> 09:52.907

09:53.125 --> 09:55.584

09:59.148 --> 10:01.822

10:02.403 --> 10:04.188

10:05.129 --> 10:08.008

10:08.269 --> 10:10.284

10:12.168 --> 10:17.334

10:17.901 --> 10:21.348

10:21.711 --> 10:25.474

10:40.738 --> 10:44.507

10:44.784 --> 10:46.074

10:59.751 --> 11:02.156

11:02.384 --> 11:04.570

11:13.199 --> 11:16.023

11:17.620 --> 11:20.388
_

11:20.676 --> 11:24.963
_

11:27.134 --> 11:29.051
We've arranged
for Weinberger and Baker

11:29.136 --> 11:31.921
to have an actual meeting in
the Weinberger study tomorrow.

11:32.005 --> 11:34.140
We also made sure
the KGB heard about it,

11:34.207 --> 11:35.775
along with the word "Spetsnaz,"

11:35.842 --> 11:38.010
which is all it takes
to drive them crazy.

11:38.078 --> 11:40.446
Given how important
this bug must be to them,

11:40.514 --> 11:42.982
they would never
risk exposing it

11:43.050 --> 11:45.484
by sending a Rezidentura officer
to pick up a recording.

11:45.552 --> 11:47.787
They know that we follow them
around day and night.

11:47.854 --> 11:49.789
That means
they should be sending in

11:49.856 --> 11:51.357
a Directorate "S" illegal.

11:51.425 --> 11:53.692
We'll be waiting.

11:57.998 --> 12:01.367
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.

12:01.418 --> 12:05.037
Henry doesn't want to go
with you guys tonight.

12:05.105 --> 12:08.774
Why not?

12:08.842 --> 12:10.476
Hey, buddy.

12:10.544 --> 12:12.945
You don't want
to come have dinner with us?

12:13.013 --> 12:15.114
No. It's game five
of the Stanley Cup,

12:15.182 --> 12:16.782
and the Islanders
<i>just</i> got a goal.

12:16.850 --> 12:18.050
Oh.

12:18.118 --> 12:19.351
I don't want to miss a thing.

12:19.419 --> 12:20.719
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, honey.

12:20.787 --> 12:22.354
- Hey.
- How are you?

12:22.422 --> 12:24.123
- Good.
- Good.

12:25.725 --> 12:27.560
You know what?

12:27.611 --> 12:29.478
Why don't I stay here with
you guys and watch the game?

12:29.563 --> 12:30.796
- Really? Cool.
- Yeah.

12:30.864 --> 12:32.498
I'll make something to eat.

12:32.566 --> 12:34.867
Great.

12:34.934 --> 12:39.238
Scooch.

12:45.545 --> 12:47.179
I think
this is gonna work, sir.

12:47.247 --> 12:48.414
I know.

12:48.482 --> 12:50.216
After we get the illegals,

12:50.283 --> 12:52.852
the Rezidentura
is gonna go ape shit.

12:52.919 --> 12:54.887
We need to do right
by our source.

12:54.955 --> 12:57.690
I'll talk to the Deputy AG...

12:57.757 --> 13:02.228
as soon as we pull this off.

13:02.295 --> 13:04.396
Oh, come on.
Really?

13:04.464 --> 13:06.265
<i>...into the crowd.</i>

13:06.333 --> 13:10.870
<i>Face-off will be</i>
<i>in the New York zone.</i>

13:10.937 --> 13:12.571
You all done?

13:12.639 --> 13:14.440
Oh, I'll grab these.

13:14.508 --> 13:15.691
<i>Jackson holds the...</i>

13:15.775 --> 13:17.309
Thank you.

13:31.424 --> 13:32.858
Did you pick a hotel?

13:32.926 --> 13:35.928
Yeah. The Melton Inn,
Tuscarora State Forest.

13:35.996 --> 13:37.563
I already packed their bags.

13:37.631 --> 13:39.298
They're in the garage

13:39.366 --> 13:40.799
if you have time
to put them in the car tonight.

13:40.867 --> 13:43.736
If they freak out about
the surprise family getaway,

13:43.803 --> 13:47.706
just say we all need a little
spontaneity in our lives.

13:49.309 --> 13:52.444
Where are you dropping
the tape?

13:52.512 --> 13:55.314
They're picking the car up
from the usual garage.

13:55.382 --> 13:58.250
If I make it out of
the meeting with the colonel,

13:58.318 --> 14:00.052
I'll be there by nightfall.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.289
We'll have a great weekend,
back home by Monday.

14:03.356 --> 14:05.558
Yeah.

14:08.895 --> 14:10.930
If not,
we're still on the same page?

14:10.997 --> 14:14.633
I take them to Ottawa
and contact the Rezidentura.

14:14.701 --> 14:18.137
I know it's not
what any of us think is ideal.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.309
But there aren't
a lot of choices then, Philip.

14:23.376 --> 14:25.344
There's one other choice
we can make right now

14:25.412 --> 14:27.246
because who cares
what the Centre ordered?

14:27.314 --> 14:29.415
All they care about
is that both missions get done.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.450
I will take the colonel.
You pick up the tape...

14:31.518 --> 14:33.919
- Philip--
- ...because Paige and Henry need you.

14:33.987 --> 14:36.822
They love you.
And I-I get it.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.324
I get it.

14:38.391 --> 14:41.794
You see us together,
and you think, "it seems easy."

14:41.861 --> 14:44.096
That's not it.
You're their mother.

14:44.164 --> 14:47.666
- I know that.
- Right.

14:51.838 --> 14:53.505
We have to follow orders.

14:53.573 --> 14:55.708
- No, we don't.
- Philip, please.

14:55.775 --> 14:59.645
Don't fight me on this.

14:59.713 --> 15:03.549
Okay, fine.
I w-- I-I won't fight you.

15:08.288 --> 15:09.989
I'm headed home, guys.

15:10.056 --> 15:12.024
Aw!

15:12.092 --> 15:13.058
I love you, dad.

15:13.126 --> 15:15.127
I love you <i>more.</i>

15:15.195 --> 15:16.996
I love you more.

15:28.751 --> 15:31.052
Got to dig a little deeper.

15:41.263 --> 15:43.064
Take a look at the last page.

15:44.600 --> 15:49.170
<i>That</i> is our own private cabana.

15:49.238 --> 15:50.572
Eight days.

15:50.639 --> 15:52.607
Stan--

15:52.675 --> 15:54.909
and your mother already said that
she would stay with Matthew.

15:54.977 --> 15:58.446
I don't want to go on vacation.

15:58.514 --> 16:02.183
Sandra, look...

16:02.251 --> 16:05.920
you know,
I've been working on this case,

16:05.988 --> 16:11.192
and it's been--
it's been terrible.

16:11.260 --> 16:15.063
But tomorrow it's gonna be over,
behind me.

16:15.131 --> 16:17.799
I swear.
And I know-- I know--

16:17.867 --> 16:19.634
how many times do you have to
hear this same old shit?

16:19.702 --> 16:20.969
I know that.

16:21.036 --> 16:25.774
Whatever has happened between us
is my fault.

16:25.841 --> 16:31.312
But I want to make it better.
I do.

16:31.380 --> 16:33.715
If you don't want to go
to the beach, I understand.

16:33.783 --> 16:35.116
But sometimes, you know,

16:35.184 --> 16:40.221
a little bit of sun,
a little bit of ocean...

16:40.289 --> 16:43.224
- It looks nice.
- It is.

16:43.292 --> 16:47.061
- Expensive.
- Philip got us a rate.

16:52.067 --> 16:56.237
I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

16:56.305 --> 16:58.239
I do. But no.

16:58.307 --> 17:01.075
It's not gonna fix anything.

17:03.379 --> 17:05.213
Sorry.

18:08.115 --> 18:11.919
_

18:12.462 --> 18:14.162
_

18:14.311 --> 18:18.310
_

18:18.858 --> 18:22.067
_

18:22.788 --> 18:25.803
_

18:26.377 --> 18:29.543
_

18:30.183 --> 18:33.889
_

18:34.585 --> 18:36.719
_

18:37.329 --> 18:39.440
_

18:40.146 --> 18:44.124
_

18:44.663 --> 18:46.755
_

18:47.417 --> 18:50.690
_

18:51.662 --> 18:55.802
_

18:56.327 --> 18:57.850
_

18:58.377 --> 19:00.721
_

19:01.212 --> 19:03.276
_

19:04.090 --> 19:06.695
_

19:07.256 --> 19:11.873
_

19:12.755 --> 19:15.234
_

19:25.871 --> 19:27.488
Can I help you?

19:27.539 --> 19:30.041
Oh. I'm Lori's aunt,
from 3d.

19:30.125 --> 19:33.061
And I'm staying with her,
and I'm locked out.

19:33.128 --> 19:37.765
Um, Lori's on her way
to her brother's,

19:37.833 --> 19:39.934
and I need to call
and tell him to send her back

19:40.002 --> 19:42.470
so she can let me in.

19:42.538 --> 19:45.306
Could I possibly
use your phone for a second?

19:45.374 --> 19:48.176
Uh, listen, uh,
I've had some problems.

19:48.243 --> 19:50.912
Um, why don't you let me
make the phone call for you?

19:50.980 --> 19:54.849
Of course.
I'm so sorry to trouble you.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.451
Here's the number.

19:56.518 --> 20:00.488
Uh... thank you so very much.

20:00.555 --> 20:02.423
Sure.

20:05.995 --> 20:07.495
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.

20:07.563 --> 20:10.531
Of course.
Hang on just a second.

20:19.942 --> 20:23.344
Your nephew
wants to speak to you.

20:23.412 --> 20:26.881
Oh? Oh.

20:26.932 --> 20:28.483
- Oh, thank you.
- No, no, no.

20:28.550 --> 20:30.184
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

20:30.252 --> 20:32.887
It's right there,
around the corner, to the left.

20:32.955 --> 20:34.155
Okay.

20:34.223 --> 20:37.025
Oh!

20:37.092 --> 20:39.727
R-Robbie?

20:39.795 --> 20:41.195
Oh, I feel so stupid.

20:41.263 --> 20:44.165
Yeah,
I-I got them from her,

20:44.233 --> 20:46.801
but I-- I left them
on the counter.

20:46.869 --> 20:49.454
I know.

20:49.538 --> 20:50.838
Ugh!

21:05.788 --> 21:08.322
You won't be able to move
for 20 minutes...

21:11.994 --> 21:19.500
...which is 10 minutes longer
than you have left.

21:44.093 --> 21:45.793
Viktor Zhukov was my friend.

21:45.861 --> 21:49.297
We met in Stalingrad in 1942.

21:49.364 --> 21:56.437
He was ragged, skin and bones,
same as we all were.

21:56.505 --> 21:58.072
First time I saw him,

21:58.140 --> 22:01.976
he was standing
over two dead Nazis.

22:04.313 --> 22:09.083
I was surprised, after the war,
that he'd survived.

22:09.151 --> 22:12.120
We found ourselves
working together

22:12.187 --> 22:16.157
in what was then called
the NKGB.

22:23.632 --> 22:26.501
- Henry?
- Hmm?

22:26.568 --> 22:32.607
- I had a nightmare.
- Paige, I'm sleeping.

22:32.674 --> 22:34.742
I'm gonna wake up mom.

22:34.810 --> 22:40.148
No. You're not allowed,
and you know that.

23:13.348 --> 23:15.616
Mom?

23:32.451 --> 23:33.818
Mom.

23:33.902 --> 23:35.870
What are you doing?

23:35.938 --> 23:38.272
I, uh--
I couldn't sleep.

23:38.323 --> 23:39.974
What are <i>you</i> doing?

23:40.042 --> 23:41.309
Laundry.

23:41.376 --> 23:44.145
Why are you down here?

23:44.213 --> 23:46.047
I wanted to get
a glass of water.

23:46.114 --> 23:48.149
Oh.

23:48.217 --> 23:50.551
You're doing laundry
in the middle of the night?

23:50.619 --> 23:53.821
I don't hear
the washing machine.

23:53.889 --> 23:55.756
I was folding.

23:57.626 --> 24:01.128
Why don't you go back up to bed,
sweetheart?

24:13.008 --> 24:14.909
Baker leaves the White House
in 90 minutes.

24:14.976 --> 24:16.193
His limo will pull up

24:16.278 --> 24:18.529
with two Secret Service cars
trailing.

24:18.614 --> 24:20.948
The meeting with
the Secretary of Defense

24:20.999 --> 24:23.167
should last
approximately 45 minutes.

24:23.252 --> 24:24.952
Now, I think
it's safe to assume that,

24:25.003 --> 24:26.537
given the level of security,

24:26.622 --> 24:28.422
they'll come pick up
their recording afterwards.

24:28.490 --> 24:33.160
Okay, I want everyone in place
starting right now.

24:37.599 --> 24:42.570
The Centre wants you
in Moscow Tuesday.

24:42.638 --> 24:45.239
You're being reassigned.

24:45.307 --> 24:47.775
I'm sorry, Claudia.

24:47.843 --> 24:49.810
In my day,
they didn't coddle you.

24:49.878 --> 24:51.612
You'll finish the assignment?

24:51.680 --> 24:53.981
Of course.

24:54.049 --> 24:55.416
Do you expect any problems?

24:55.484 --> 24:56.951
Not from them.

24:57.019 --> 24:59.253
But as I've been
telling the Centre all along,

24:59.321 --> 25:03.157
every instinct I have is
crying out that this is a setup.

25:03.225 --> 25:06.427
- This is what you think?
- It is.

25:06.495 --> 25:08.162
But sometimes
the Centre sees a pot of gold,

25:08.230 --> 25:10.064
and they can't keep
their hands in their pockets.

25:10.132 --> 25:11.465
You should get
Philip and Elizabeth

25:11.533 --> 25:12.833
out of this, Arkady.

25:12.901 --> 25:15.236
They just
stabbed you in the back.

25:15.304 --> 25:17.104
You care so much about them?

25:17.172 --> 25:19.273
So long as
I still have this job,

25:19.341 --> 25:22.310
I'm responsible
for my officers.

25:22.377 --> 25:24.478
<i>You're</i> responsible for them,
too.

25:24.546 --> 25:26.614
This is happening in one hour,
Claudia.

25:26.682 --> 25:29.417
It means I would have to
abort the mission on my own.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.086
- You have that authority.
- I do?

25:32.154 --> 25:34.355
When the Centre
has been this clear

25:34.423 --> 25:36.791
and there is
no new information?

25:36.858 --> 25:40.027
Besides, if you're wrong,
we'd be giving up

25:40.095 --> 25:41.929
the greatest
intelligence success

25:41.997 --> 25:43.531
since we got the atom bomb.

25:43.598 --> 25:44.932
That's what we always say

25:45.000 --> 25:47.168
right before
our people die for nothing.

25:47.235 --> 25:53.674
The next thing we always say is,
"It was <i>so</i> obvious."

25:56.445 --> 25:58.596
Mr. Philip, I have
the singles resort itinerary

25:58.680 --> 26:00.047
up on the screen.

26:00.115 --> 26:03.217
- It wants approval, hmm?
- All right.

26:25.407 --> 26:28.242
Big news?
What big news?

26:28.310 --> 26:30.378
I want you to stay here
for the next few hours,

26:30.445 --> 26:32.480
and then--
then I'll tell you everything.

26:32.547 --> 26:35.383
They expect me back.
I can't stay.

26:35.450 --> 26:38.019
You're not going back.

26:38.086 --> 26:40.154
I can't tell you all the details
right now,

26:40.222 --> 26:42.156
but in a few hours
I'm going to have

26:42.224 --> 26:45.860
some very, very happy people
at the FBI.

26:45.927 --> 26:50.564
And they're going to approve
your exfiltration.

26:50.632 --> 26:53.000
Just like that?
Just like that.

26:53.068 --> 26:55.903
It's time, Nina.

27:02.010 --> 27:05.079
My God.

27:05.147 --> 27:07.615
Aren't you happy?

27:07.682 --> 27:09.417
Of course.

27:09.484 --> 27:13.587
I-- I-I just...

27:13.655 --> 27:17.525
You didn't think
I'd come through.

27:17.592 --> 27:21.529
I knew you would.

27:21.596 --> 27:24.365
Listen, Nina, they're gonna
want to send you out west

27:24.433 --> 27:26.967
'cause your people don't have
any resources out there,

27:27.035 --> 27:29.437
but-- but there are
different cities,

27:29.504 --> 27:31.405
different places
you can choose.

27:31.473 --> 27:34.608
Mm.

27:34.676 --> 27:38.312
We won't see each other.

27:42.217 --> 27:44.952
Probably not for a long time.

27:45.020 --> 27:47.621
But you're gonna be okay, Nina.

27:47.689 --> 27:50.357
I told you I'd get you through
to the other side of this.

28:01.035 --> 28:02.219
Where's Philip?

28:02.304 --> 28:03.771
Oh, he said he had to run.

28:03.839 --> 28:05.973
Uh, and he wanted me
to give you this.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.642
Thank you.

28:14.006 --> 28:20.928
_

29:02.055 --> 29:04.190
I have meetings.
I'll call in later.

29:04.241 --> 29:07.126
- Okay.
- See you tomorrow.

29:08.529 --> 29:09.996
- How we doing?
- Everyone's in position.

29:10.063 --> 29:11.631
Meeting's about to take place.

29:11.698 --> 29:13.366
- Okay. I'll be on radio.
- By the way, Brenn called.

29:13.433 --> 29:15.168
That guy Prince-- he started
shouting at the glass.

29:15.235 --> 29:16.869
And?

29:16.937 --> 29:19.505
- He wants immunity and 500,000 grand.
- For what?

29:19.573 --> 29:22.375
We'll find out when he gets
immunity and 500,000 grand.

29:22.442 --> 29:24.110
You sure he's not bluffing?

29:24.178 --> 29:26.145
The guy's a gambler, but I don't
think he's a bluffer.

29:26.213 --> 29:28.714
- We should make the deal.
- Okay.

29:38.926 --> 29:41.480
"Very, very happy people
at the FBI"?

29:41.504 --> 29:42.527
_

29:42.667 --> 29:45.531
_

29:46.047 --> 29:48.668
_

29:48.814 --> 29:49.837
_

29:49.937 --> 29:51.429
_

29:51.543 --> 29:52.909
_

29:53.239 --> 29:56.657
_

29:57.423 --> 29:58.914
_

30:16.129 --> 30:18.898
Hold, everybody. Hold.

30:31.011 --> 30:33.312
She's a resident.
She's a resident.

30:42.821 --> 30:45.673
_

30:46.034 --> 30:47.377
_

30:47.562 --> 30:49.842
_

30:50.000 --> 30:53.833
_

30:54.043 --> 30:56.260
_

30:56.381 --> 30:57.803
_

31:52.926 --> 31:57.096
Future's bright,
don't you think?

31:57.164 --> 32:00.666
Good lord, is that <i>really</i>
<i>what I asked you to say?</i>

32:00.734 --> 32:03.169
Forgive me.

32:03.236 --> 32:05.338
I was in a hurry.

32:05.405 --> 32:06.672
Sit.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.683
So, I hope I don't seem rude.

32:17.751 --> 32:20.453
In fact, it's out of
appreciation and gratitude

32:20.520 --> 32:23.689
that I'd like to keep
our meeting short today--

32:23.757 --> 32:25.324
safer, basically.

32:25.392 --> 32:26.959
Let me just say,

32:27.027 --> 32:31.330
our technical people said
what you sent us was incredible.

32:31.398 --> 32:36.802
It <i>is</i> incredible--
from the Latin "incredibilis,"

32:36.870 --> 32:43.242
"in" meaning "not,"
"credible" meaning-- well...

32:43.310 --> 32:46.379
Your message said
you had something vital for us,

32:46.446 --> 32:49.648
something from the president's
anti-ballistic-missile program.

32:49.716 --> 32:52.151
I'm giving it to you now,
but you're not hearing me.

32:52.219 --> 32:57.189
The technology--
it's <i>incredibilis.</i>

32:58.892 --> 33:02.194
At best, it's 50 years
from being remotely operational.

33:02.262 --> 33:05.097
- The damn thing's a fantasy.
- Well, if that's true,

33:05.165 --> 33:06.899
why the commitment
from the Reagan administration?

33:06.967 --> 33:08.834
The hell if
I'm supposed to know that.

33:08.902 --> 33:10.836
Some people say
the President only hears

33:10.904 --> 33:12.505
what he wants to hear.

33:12.572 --> 33:17.243
Some say it's all one big psyop,
a way of getting the Soviets

33:17.310 --> 33:19.045
to spend themselves
into oblivion,

33:19.112 --> 33:20.413
trying to keep up
with a technology

33:20.480 --> 33:22.048
that will never pan out.

33:22.115 --> 33:26.719
And really, that's just what
the world needs, isn't it?

33:26.787 --> 33:33.359
Another crazy arms race,
but this time in space.

33:59.870 --> 34:02.321
What the hell's going on?
What are you doing?

34:02.372 --> 34:05.708
You got
the emergency abort signal.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.076
It's a setup.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.043
It's not possible.
Who did you tell?

34:09.129 --> 34:10.629
We didn't tell anyone.
Calm down.

34:10.697 --> 34:11.996
I don't think you did, either.

34:12.047 --> 34:13.581
I saw the signal.

34:13.667 --> 34:17.803
They wouldn't send that out
unless this was a setup.

34:17.871 --> 34:20.054
There's nobody here.

34:22.542 --> 34:25.177
This isn't the setup.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.563
Elizabeth.

35:24.804 --> 35:27.039
We got another woman
approaching the car.

35:27.107 --> 35:29.408
We have another woman
approaching the car.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.549
Everybody, hold.
Wait for the moment.

35:36.616 --> 35:40.219
I don't want anybody moving
until someone opens that trunk

35:40.287 --> 35:42.488
or gets into that car.

35:52.632 --> 35:54.367
This could be it.
This could be it.

36:01.842 --> 36:03.676
What the hell?

36:07.030 --> 36:09.782
- It's a couple.
- Get in!

36:09.858 --> 36:11.592
Go! Go!

36:11.660 --> 36:13.127
It's them. Take them.
Take them!

36:16.465 --> 36:18.999
- Get the backup moving.
- Hold on.

36:44.242 --> 36:47.745
God damn it!

36:55.437 --> 36:58.089
Get in the cars!
Get in the cars!

36:58.173 --> 36:59.507
Go! Go!

37:22.297 --> 37:24.632
Block off Moore
at the 320 intersection.

37:24.699 --> 37:26.634
No, Hennig,
go left on Lincoln from 320.

37:32.474 --> 37:34.975
Shut down Eastern Avenue
at the Takoma Metro.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.354
Okay, Second Unit,
Second Unit southeast on Fenton.

37:47.422 --> 37:49.512
Balducci, Balducci, 8th Street northeast.
Check the north side of Van Buren.

38:09.978 --> 38:12.980
You get the prints.
I'll get the car.

39:35.747 --> 39:38.449
We should still take the kids
to that hotel tonight.

39:38.533 --> 39:41.135
Really?

39:41.202 --> 39:45.089
It'd be nice.

39:47.075 --> 39:49.510
What's wrong?

39:53.932 --> 39:56.600
Okay. Okay.

39:56.685 --> 40:00.604
Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

40:03.058 --> 40:04.591
It's okay.
Look at me.

40:06.127 --> 40:09.647
Look at me.

40:09.731 --> 40:10.948
Look at me!

40:19.641 --> 40:21.992
Nina?

40:22.077 --> 40:25.179
Nina?

40:29.751 --> 40:33.988
I took a bath...
to start my new life.

40:38.326 --> 40:39.493
What?

40:39.561 --> 40:43.897
It didn't work out, Nina.

40:43.965 --> 40:45.699
It all fell apart.

40:45.767 --> 40:52.339
I can't.
I can't go back there, Stan.

40:52.407 --> 40:54.742
I'm sorry.

40:54.809 --> 40:57.845
I don't know what I--
I thought it was...

40:57.912 --> 41:00.414
I'm gonna take care of this
for you.

41:00.482 --> 41:01.782
I am.

41:01.850 --> 41:07.187
Just... not yet.

41:14.129 --> 41:18.298
Shh. It's okay.

41:18.350 --> 41:21.568
I know. I know.
I know you will.

41:21.636 --> 41:25.189
I know. I know.

42:11.236 --> 42:14.254
You should go home
to your children.

42:14.322 --> 42:16.123
I'm not leaving her.

42:16.191 --> 42:18.525
She's gonna have to stay here
with us a very long time, Philip.

42:18.593 --> 42:21.395
I'm <i>not</i> leaving her.

42:33.441 --> 42:36.777
Her great aunt?
Had she been ill?

42:36.845 --> 42:38.178
Uh, no.
She fell down the stairs.

42:38.246 --> 42:39.680
W-we don't see her much,

42:39.748 --> 42:42.649
um, but Elizabeth's
the only relative she's got.

42:42.717 --> 42:46.320
So we're driving up now,
and I-I think Elizabeth

42:46.387 --> 42:49.189
may stay up for a while
and take care of her.

42:49.257 --> 42:51.558
Okay, well, we'll watch
the kids. Don't worry about it.

42:51.626 --> 42:54.695
I really,
really appreciate your help.
