07:46.330 --> 07:47.630

07:47.730 --> 07:48.900

really good at this.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.700

-Well, you know...
-Don't jinx us.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.070

07:57.040 --> 07:58.210
-No.
-...Which is good.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.610
I looked at it and I thought
immediately,

07:59.710 --> 08:01.440
"this is
a little old lady's car.

08:01.540 --> 08:02.680
"I wonder which little old lady

08:02.780 --> 08:04.080
he hit over the head
to get this car."

08:04.180 --> 08:05.310
richard:
Here's what I was thinking.

08:05.410 --> 08:07.050
I got on the old interwebs
this morning when I can't

08:07.150 --> 08:08.580
sleep at 3:00 in the morning
because I'm panicking about

08:08.680 --> 08:09.880
how I'm going
to make y'all's paychecks,

08:10.020 --> 08:11.280
and I realize that nascar
is coming to town,

08:11.390 --> 08:14.290
and that's a market
we've yet to tap into,

08:14.390 --> 08:18.630
and I typed in, you know, '51,
'52 chevy coupes

08:18.730 --> 08:19.860
and started looking through
some of the images

08:19.960 --> 08:21.830
and some of the pictures,
and a lot of them that came up

08:21.930 --> 08:24.600
were early nascars.

08:24.700 --> 08:28.440
The first official nascar race
was on daytona beach in 1948,

08:28.540 --> 08:30.040
and in the years ahead the cars

08:30.140 --> 08:31.710
were souped-up versions
of the chevys and fords

08:31.810 --> 08:34.140
that your grandparents
were taking on grocery runs.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.510
With a little gas monkey tlc,

08:35.610 --> 08:39.150
my '52 could be
a daytona racer reincarnated.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.320
Now, if we made a replica
of one,

08:44.420 --> 08:46.820
as it is, stocky stock,
then we went out

08:46.920 --> 08:48.520
and had a little fun with it,
somebody just...

08:48.620 --> 08:52.030
They can go down to the local
car show and stuff like that,

08:52.130 --> 08:54.130
and they got
a cool piece of art.

08:54.230 --> 08:55.560
There's a market for '52 hot
rods,

08:55.660 --> 08:57.330
but when you're making
a period correct race car,

08:57.430 --> 08:58.770
well, your market is shrinking.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.200
But those are the guys
that are walking around

09:00.300 --> 09:01.940
with a bunch of money
in their pockets,

09:02.040 --> 09:04.070
and that's where I want to be:
In some rich guy's pocket.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.140
If we could do anything to it,
what would be the idea?

09:06.240 --> 09:07.510
We keep the outside
the way it looks,

09:07.610 --> 09:08.880
put some numbers on it,
some letters.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.380
We do all the right details,

09:10.480 --> 09:12.680
but underneath we do
a more modern front end

09:12.780 --> 09:15.320
and rear end, make it handle,
make it drive good,

09:15.420 --> 09:17.250
put a later model v8 in it,
and then

09:17.350 --> 09:19.420
but when you look on the outside
you don't know it has that.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.750
Early stock cars
were all about

09:20.860 --> 09:22.160
looking plain jane
on the outside,

09:22.260 --> 09:23.420
but having
enough power on the inside

09:23.530 --> 09:25.060
to outrun the law
and your buddies on the track.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.860
Think how badass it would be
to do donuts in this car.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.400
It ain't going to do donuts
the way it is.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.060
No, it's not.
I think richard's idea

09:30.170 --> 09:32.030
of turning this into
a stock car or early '50s

09:32.130 --> 09:34.600
nascar version of this car,
that's a really cool idea

09:34.700 --> 09:36.470
and something I actually
have always wanted to do.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.670
You know, we're thinking high fs
on the front with disc brakes,

09:38.770 --> 09:40.710
a 9-inch on the rear,
disc brakes,

09:40.810 --> 09:44.040
small block, manual trans,
probably a hydraulic clutch,

09:44.150 --> 09:45.850
and then just the rest of
it's just getting the look.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.980
You know,
even though as clean as it is,

09:48.080 --> 09:49.480
it's just a perfect canvas
for a hot rod,

09:49.590 --> 09:51.180
but we have to actually
have the performance too.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.190
We want a car that's not
just show but show-and-go.

09:53.290 --> 09:55.690
If you're talking restoration,
all that costs money anyway.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.020
Okay, fine,
but it's got to get done.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.060
This stock car not only needs
to look period correct,

10:00.160 --> 10:01.630
but it needs to be able
to perform,

10:01.730 --> 10:03.700
and we better get it done soon
because there's about to be

10:03.800 --> 10:05.870
a big nascar race
right here in dallas,

10:05.970 --> 10:07.470
and the whole town
will be flipped upside down

10:07.570 --> 10:09.500
with nascar fans.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.100
Here's the plan --

10:11.210 --> 10:12.740
we're gonna make
this chevy coupe into

10:12.840 --> 10:14.610
a 1950s nascar racer,

10:14.710 --> 10:16.810
give it new independent
front suspension

10:16.910 --> 10:18.850
and a two-link rear,
modern coilovers

10:18.950 --> 10:21.450
from ridetech
and wilwood brakes.

10:21.550 --> 10:22.720
To push it around the track,

10:22.820 --> 10:24.380
she'll get a small-block
crate motor.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.150
Inside it will be all business
with a race cage for safety.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.290
And finally on the outside,
well, we'll keep the paint

10:29.390 --> 10:30.760
because it's original,

10:30.830 --> 10:32.290
but we'll dress it up
to make it look track-ready.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.490
To get it all done,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.230
I'm giving the guys a budget
of 12 grand and 2 weeks

10:35.330 --> 10:37.600
to resurrect this chevy
as a '50s racer,

10:37.700 --> 10:39.100
which I'm hoping to sell as soon

10:39.200 --> 10:41.600
as they can finish building it
for at least 30 grand.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.840
All right. Cool.

is u.V. Resistant,

That will give us the room

33:29.170 --> 33:32.070
Doing it this way allows

The motor is called a stoker
because the crank

34:12.880 --> 34:14.780
has been changed to give
the pistons a longer stroke.

That's the motor mount.

420 horsepower,

now up from it's original 350.
Even with a short water pump,

34:25.130 --> 34:26.260
we got to go back
with the motor.

why we need another car

1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:54.540
in here to sell.

1:20:54.650 --> 1:20:56.480
Because I just posted an ad
for it on the interwebs,

1:20:56.580 --> 1:20:58.380
and it's got a ton
of views already, daphne,

1:20:58.480 --> 1:20:59.780
and, well, because we got
the room for it,

1:20:59.880 --> 1:21:01.350
we might as well
have cars in here.

test drive at the dirt track,

1:21:03.020 --> 1:21:04.950
I had coy dust off
the '52 chevy,

so we can feature it over
in the merch shop.

1:21:06.890 --> 1:21:08.890
You see, as soon as the monkeys
finished building it,

1:21:08.990 --> 1:21:10.530
I put it up on
the gas monkey website,

1:21:10.630 --> 1:21:13.000
and a few people already want
to come by and check it out.

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:15.800

-Thank you.

because it's the third car here,

1:21:19.940 --> 1:21:21.400

"well, we sell cars."

1:21:21.510 --> 1:21:22.610

-So...

-This is for sale?
-Hey, sir. I'm richard.

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:26.680
Yeah. Yeah.
We just finished building this,

1:21:26.780 --> 1:21:29.750
so I just brought it in here,
but it is for sale.

Business coupe?

1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:32.920
Is it a business coupe.

1:21:33.020 --> 1:21:34.520
My dad had a '52 business coupe.
No kidding?

1:21:34.620 --> 1:21:36.120
-Yeah.
-Right on.

1:21:36.250 --> 1:21:37.590
Coy just set the parking brake,

1:21:37.690 --> 1:21:39.920
and already we got ourselves
a little lookie-loo.

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:41.460
So, daphne, you just leave
the marketing

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:42.660

all original paint

except for we clear-coated
the outside.

1:21:47.270 --> 1:21:48.560

made it reminiscent

had a business coupe,

as what I'm looking at now.

1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:05.010
It was an old rust bucket.

in the day, redo it,

a business coupe.

We would have normally done
a single seat,

1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:13.820
but I figured anybody
that's going to have fun with it

1:22:13.930 --> 1:22:15.220
is going to want to
take somebody with them.

-Yeah.

a test drive?

Domingo: As we're driving
the car, it sounds great.

It's made to go fast, and that's
exactly what I'm looking for.

1:23:02.110 --> 1:23:04.410
I was kind of hoping to get
about 30 grand for it.

I mean, every single nut

1:23:08.950 --> 1:23:10.080
Mm.

1:23:10.180 --> 1:23:11.710
So I bought this car
for 1,800 bucks,

1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:13.850
and I put $12,000 into it,
and that brought us up

1:23:13.950 --> 1:23:15.950
for a lot of power
and a lot of good braking,

you got money in it.
