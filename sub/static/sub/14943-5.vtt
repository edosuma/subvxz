01:00.561 --> 01:02.162
(Footsteps approach)

01:02.163 --> 01:04.264
The clicking of those heels
could only mean one thing.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.297
No place like home?

01:07.298 --> 01:08.638
That's where he'd rather be.

01:08.639 --> 01:12.442
Your m.I. Already identified
him as Freddie delgado.

01:12.443 --> 01:14.704
One hole in the windshield,
one hole in his head.

01:14.705 --> 01:17.477
Easy math.

01:17.478 --> 01:21.251
He's got tats.
Gangbanger. He's a 26er.

01:21.252 --> 01:22.582
I don't think it was
a gang hit, though.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.083
They're usually much
more out in the open,

01:24.084 --> 01:25.585
kind of a show of force.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.487
(Radio chatter continues)

01:27.488 --> 01:29.159
What in the hell is this?

01:29.160 --> 01:32.492
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

01:32.493 --> 01:34.594
There's more where
that came from.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.596
(Adam) Tommy.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.228
C.s.u.'s got trajectory.

01:38.229 --> 01:39.569
The shooter was standing here.

01:39.570 --> 01:41.401
Clean shot. Boom.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.572
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:42.573 --> 01:44.103
And look here.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.735
Sunflower seeds.

01:45.736 --> 01:47.737
Shooter was
probably chewing them

01:47.738 --> 01:49.439
while waiting for
delgado to show.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.610
(Camera shutter clicks,
radio chatter continues)

01:50.611 --> 01:52.482
The killer was lying in wait.

01:52.483 --> 01:54.315
This is premeditated.

02:04.595 --> 02:06.497
Hello, mother.

02:07.858 --> 02:09.299
To what do I owe the pleasure?

02:09.300 --> 02:12.162
Well, I have some news

02:12.163 --> 02:14.204
and I wanted to
tell you in person.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.205
What's that?

02:15.206 --> 02:17.167
I'm selling the house.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.308
I didn't even know
it was on the market.

02:18.309 --> 02:20.210
It wasn't. A realtor came by

02:20.211 --> 02:22.442
with a cash offer from
an interested buyer,

02:22.443 --> 02:24.744
and it was a very generous one.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.576
You've had that
house for 40 years.

02:26.577 --> 02:28.848
You get one offer,
and you're just gonna...

02:28.849 --> 02:32.322
What, take a chance to
finally move on with my life?

02:32.323 --> 02:33.483
Okay. I just... i just...

02:33.484 --> 02:35.725
I don't know how
I feel about this.

02:35.726 --> 02:38.188
Well, you never really come by.

02:38.189 --> 02:40.159
So if you expect me
to live out my days

02:40.160 --> 02:41.531
in a time capsule

02:41.532 --> 02:44.864
just because it holds
ancient memories,

02:44.865 --> 02:46.496
you're mistaken.

02:46.497 --> 02:47.937
Could you just take
some time to think about it?

02:47.938 --> 02:50.400
I did, and it's done.

02:50.401 --> 02:51.841
Escrow's gonna close very soon,

02:51.842 --> 02:53.503
so if you have
anything at the house,

02:53.504 --> 02:55.505
you should probably
come by and get it out

02:55.506 --> 02:56.947
as soon as possible.

02:58.749 --> 03:02.252
I'll leave you to your work.

03:02.253 --> 03:06.256
(People speaking indistinctly)

03:06.257 --> 03:09.259
(Footsteps approach)

03:09.260 --> 03:10.690
Move.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.921
Please.

03:11.922 --> 03:12.893
What's wrong with you?

03:12.894 --> 03:14.264
Nothing.

03:14.265 --> 03:15.595
That's a whole lot of something.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.697
If you must know,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.399
my mother is selling the house.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.800
What house?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.932
Oh, "the house" house.

03:22.933 --> 03:24.304
Mm-hmm.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.775
Oh, yeah. I remember that place.

03:25.776 --> 03:27.937
Well, some of it...

03:27.938 --> 03:30.740
The shower, kitchen
counter, mudroom.

03:30.741 --> 03:32.482
(Ethan) Ugh.

03:32.483 --> 03:34.344
I'm gonna do my best
to UN-remember that.

03:34.345 --> 03:35.645
Okay.

03:35.646 --> 03:37.987
We have some bruising,

03:37.988 --> 03:39.949
minor lacerations...
(Camera shutter clicking)

03:39.950 --> 03:42.422
All in the process of healing.

03:42.423 --> 03:47.297
He might have been in a
fight 24 to 48 hours ago.

03:47.298 --> 03:49.629
So I've got some info on
our friend Freddie here.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.731
He was a recent
jailbird. (Sighs)

03:51.732 --> 03:53.503
He shot and killed
a 6-year-old girl

03:53.504 --> 03:54.904
during a robbery.

03:54.905 --> 03:55.866
He was released just last week.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.236
That's the same
girl whose photos

03:57.237 --> 03:58.408
we found in Freddie's car.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.769
Why was he released early?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.311
Well, a mistrial was called

04:01.312 --> 04:03.813
because the prosecution
improperly admitted evidence.

04:03.814 --> 04:06.276
Oh. That's a major miss.

04:06.277 --> 04:07.717
(Ethan) So the
murderer got to walk.

04:07.718 --> 04:08.878
Not for long.

04:08.879 --> 04:10.350
After the ruling,
the girl's father

04:10.351 --> 04:11.721
jumped over the partition,
tried to attack Freddie.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.252
Said he was gonna kill him.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.457
Well, maybe he made
good on his threat.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.862
Yes, that's my
daughter. That's Emily.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.935
We're very sorry for
your loss, Mr. Winters.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.637
Where did you get this?

04:27.638 --> 04:30.900
We found multiple copies
inside Freddie delgado's car.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.472
He was shot and
killed this morning.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.804
Oh, what a shame.

04:34.805 --> 04:35.905
(Adam) You know,

04:35.906 --> 04:38.308
it's, um...

04:38.309 --> 04:41.280
It's no secret you tried
to attack him in court,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.613
Mr. Winters.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.385
No surprise you'd
be angry with him.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.857
You have any idea why
he'd have these photos?

04:47.858 --> 04:49.919
Yeah, I had been following him,

04:49.920 --> 04:52.462
leaving copies where
I knew he'd find them

04:52.463 --> 04:55.024
so he wouldn't forget my
baby girl or what he did.

04:55.025 --> 04:56.866
You didn't happen to follow him

04:56.867 --> 04:58.868
to a parking garage
this morning, did you?

04:58.869 --> 05:00.870
Decide to take a little revenge?

05:00.871 --> 05:05.575
Look, the day Freddie
delgado shot my daughter...

05:05.576 --> 05:07.807
He actually took two lives.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.440
Parents aren't supposed
to outlive their children.

05:10.441 --> 05:13.012
It's not the natural order.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.584
(Sighs)

05:14.585 --> 05:17.887
I was supposed to
watch Emily grow up.

05:17.888 --> 05:21.891
So besides taking Emily...

05:21.892 --> 05:24.023
He actually took my future.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.597
And was I angry with him?

05:27.598 --> 05:30.560
Yeah. Beyond reason.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.031
And did I wish him dead?

05:32.032 --> 05:35.535
Many, many times.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.568
But did I take revenge?

05:40.711 --> 05:42.473
No.

05:44.815 --> 05:47.117
Not today.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.088
(Exhales)

05:59.089 --> 06:00.530
(Siren whoops)

06:00.531 --> 06:03.062
(Indistinct conversations)

06:03.063 --> 06:04.434
I'll be right back.

06:04.435 --> 06:05.595
(Woman) Here he is.

06:05.596 --> 06:06.866
What's going on?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.798
He's walking? Not
enough to hold him.

06:08.799 --> 06:10.470
Oh, hey.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.402
D.n.a. Evidence came back
on the sunflower seeds...

06:12.403 --> 06:13.973
No match to him or
anybody in the system.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.945
Plus, his alibi checked out.
(Woman) Excuse me, Mr. Winters.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.376
Yes.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.878
I understand you were
brought in for questioning

06:18.879 --> 06:20.009
on the Freddie delgado murder.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.380
Yes.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.613
Mr. Delgado shot and
killed your daughter,

06:23.614 --> 06:25.114
yet he walked free and clear,

06:25.115 --> 06:27.116
only to be shot dead
himself just this morning.

06:27.117 --> 06:29.689
Care to give us your
thoughts on the matter?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.061
Uh...

06:32.062 --> 06:34.724
My daughter was
taken by a monster

06:34.725 --> 06:37.897
who showed no
repentance for what he did.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.169
And today he got
what he deserved.

06:40.170 --> 06:43.002
And I didn't kill
him, but I wish I had.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.034
I should've stood
up for my daughter.

06:45.035 --> 06:47.006
Mr. Winters, are you saying
you advocate vigilante justice?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.708
Call it whatever you want,

06:48.709 --> 06:50.039
but people have to
pay for their actions

06:50.040 --> 06:51.011
one way or another.

06:51.012 --> 06:52.512
An eye for an eye.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.013
You know, and sure, people say

06:54.014 --> 06:56.145
that getting payback doesn't
make you feel any better,

06:56.146 --> 06:59.088
but I'll tell you one
thing... They're lying.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.920
It does.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.792
(Woman) Do you have any
idea who might have done this?

07:02.793 --> 07:03.923
(Reporters all talking at once)

07:03.924 --> 07:06.095
That was Paul
winters speaking out

07:06.096 --> 07:08.027
on the Freddie delgado murder.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.859
So much for the
grieving father, huh?

07:09.860 --> 07:11.861
He just laid down
a call to arms.

07:11.862 --> 07:14.163
Eat up. It's gonna
be a long day.

07:14.164 --> 07:18.968
(Woman) Call me
when you're done.

07:18.969 --> 07:20.641
♪♪♪

07:27.978 --> 07:30.720
Whereas I express nothing
but my deepest condolences

07:30.721 --> 07:32.722
for the loss that
Mr. Winters has suffered,

07:32.723 --> 07:35.124
I cannot, however,
echo his sentiments.

07:35.125 --> 07:36.826
Over here. Ow! Ow!

07:36.827 --> 07:39.058
Vigilante justice will not
be tolerated in any form.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.990
(Paul) Call it
whatever you want,

07:40.991 --> 07:41.962
but people have to
pay for their actions

07:41.963 --> 07:43.493
one way or another.

07:43.494 --> 07:44.994
So I was just at the
lab. An eye for an eye...

07:44.995 --> 07:47.136
What's all this about?
Why is it so busy?

07:47.137 --> 07:48.798
You have Paul
winters to thank for this.

07:48.799 --> 07:51.000
His eye-for-an-eye
speech went viral.

07:51.001 --> 07:52.141
Wow. So people are
just getting back against

07:52.142 --> 07:53.603
anyone who's wronged them?

07:53.604 --> 07:55.104
A lot of wounded
people out there

07:55.105 --> 07:56.506
just looking for a
reason to go off.

07:56.507 --> 07:59.008
26 calls so far. Thankfully,
no homicides yet.

07:59.009 --> 08:00.550
Maybe I should
rough up my landlord.

08:00.551 --> 08:03.713
He's been pretty damn slow
to fix my toilet. (Chuckles)

08:03.714 --> 08:05.014
Hey, anything on
delgado's shooter?

08:05.015 --> 08:06.716
Uh, no.

08:06.717 --> 08:08.858
The projectile Megan
recovered from his head

08:08.859 --> 08:12.191
was too damaged
to run through I.B.I.S.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.824
You know, I'm gonna
double-check Paul's alibi.

08:14.825 --> 08:16.826
Run through his financials.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.828
If he's not the
killer, I don't know,

08:18.829 --> 08:21.170
maybe he hired
someone to do it for him?

08:21.171 --> 08:22.532
Sounds good.

08:22.533 --> 08:23.703
I'm gonna go see
the victim's widow.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.034
This guy was no Saint.

08:25.035 --> 08:27.176
Maybe something from his
past came back to haunt him.

08:27.177 --> 08:30.741
We gotta nip this
in the bud, quick.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.816
(TV playing indistinctly)

08:39.019 --> 08:40.249
Mrs. Delgado?

08:40.250 --> 08:41.751
Yeah.

08:41.752 --> 08:43.152
I'm detective Sullivan
from Philadelphia p.D.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.595
This is Dr. Hunt from the
medical examiner's office.

08:45.596 --> 08:47.526
Could we talk to
you for a minute?

08:47.527 --> 08:51.061
(TV continues
playing indistinctly)

08:52.532 --> 08:54.864
What's it like to be
married to a child killer?

08:54.865 --> 08:56.306
Hey.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.240
(Door closes)

09:01.241 --> 09:05.044
(Man speaking Spanish on TV)

09:05.045 --> 09:08.217
Mrs. Delgado, we're very
sorry about your husband.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.019
We're trying to
determine who shot him,

09:10.020 --> 09:13.122
but we couldn't help but
notice his gang tattoos.

09:13.123 --> 09:14.283
That's old ink.

09:14.284 --> 09:18.287
He gave all that up
when horacio was born.

09:18.288 --> 09:20.790
Freddie wanted a
better life for him.

09:20.791 --> 09:24.193
But ain't nobody hiring a high
school dropout with a record.

09:24.194 --> 09:25.895
(Sighs)

09:25.896 --> 09:27.967
But babies still
need formula, right?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.969
Is that why he robbed
that supermarket?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.871
Look, he didn't mean for
nobody to get hurt, okay?

09:31.872 --> 09:34.573
And if that one bullet hadn't
gotten away from him...

09:34.574 --> 09:37.106
It tore Freddie up inside.

09:37.107 --> 09:38.577
Not enough for
him to plead guilty.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.152
(Man continues speaking Spanish)

09:45.956 --> 09:48.117
Where'd this come
from? (Horacio cries)

09:48.118 --> 09:50.059
That girl's dad came
by day before yesterday,

09:50.060 --> 09:51.721
shoved it under the door.

09:51.722 --> 09:53.362
Freddie caught him.
He tried to apologize,

09:53.363 --> 09:54.964
but that guy went crazy.

09:54.965 --> 09:58.167
I mean, like totally
out of his mind.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.169
Freddie...

10:00.170 --> 10:01.701
He just stood there. (Cries)

10:01.702 --> 10:04.203
I mean, he didn't even fight
back. Like, how could he?

10:04.204 --> 10:05.935
(Sighs)

10:05.936 --> 10:07.877
(Whispers) Hi, papa.

10:07.878 --> 10:09.909
Hi. Come on, baby.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.080
(Cries)

10:11.081 --> 10:12.712
Now he's gone, and we're alone,

10:12.713 --> 10:14.644
and the world
just keeps turning.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.115
We're gonna find
out who did this.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.819
Yeah. Whatever.

10:22.152 --> 10:25.094
Paul didn't say anything about
going to the victim's house.

10:25.095 --> 10:28.127
(Megan) Yeah, or
attacking him again.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.129
I checked out Mr. Eye
for an eye's alibi.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.101
Any holes?

10:31.102 --> 10:32.261
No, the opposite actually.

10:32.262 --> 10:33.632
I got time-stamped
security footage

10:33.633 --> 10:34.964
of him at a food court
at westbrook mall.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.365
He was there at the
time of the shooting.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.768
So Paul couldn't have done it.
Could he have hired somebody?

10:38.769 --> 10:41.140
Not unless hit men
do pro bono work.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.411
After Paul's
daughter was killed,

10:42.412 --> 10:44.073
he got a divorce,
he lost his job.

10:44.074 --> 10:46.946
(Huffs) You know, he doesn't
have two dimes to rub together.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.077
We're at a dead end.

10:48.078 --> 10:50.119
So we let it be.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.781
Karma killed him.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.122
You know what?

10:53.123 --> 10:55.955
Honestly, I'm not gonna
lose any sleep over it.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.326
(Megan) What's
going on with you?

10:57.327 --> 11:00.990
You don't like the victim
so you stop doing your job?

11:00.991 --> 11:02.732
(Children speaking indistinctly)

11:02.733 --> 11:04.063
(Car door closes)

11:04.064 --> 11:05.966
(Engine turns over)

11:11.441 --> 11:12.802
Hi. Hi, grandma.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.003
Come on in.

11:14.004 --> 11:15.745
Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Megan.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.346
Yeah. I'm excited for you.

11:17.347 --> 11:18.708
Yeah? I was thinking maybe
you could move downtown

11:18.709 --> 11:19.879
and be closer to us.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.011
Oh, I would love that.
I would love it. Mm.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.353
(Kisses) You're such a doll.

11:24.354 --> 11:25.915
Well, Megan,

11:25.916 --> 11:27.386
I'll be selling most of the
furniture and the decor,

11:27.387 --> 11:31.160
so feel free to take
anything of sentimental value.

11:31.161 --> 11:32.962
Mm. Sentimental value?

11:32.963 --> 11:35.295
Imagine that.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.035
I used to come up here
when I was your age

11:46.036 --> 11:48.739
to get lost.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.482
(Chuckles)

11:53.483 --> 11:56.445
Here it is.

11:56.446 --> 11:57.887
Wow.

11:57.888 --> 11:59.118
Mm.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.090
Was this yours?

12:00.091 --> 12:01.450
Mm-hmm.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.153
Oh, look.

12:04.154 --> 12:06.857
(Chuckles)

12:08.028 --> 12:11.130
(Chuckles)

12:11.131 --> 12:12.131
Quarter.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.806
I put the stitches
in that tiger.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.167
Always a doctor.

12:18.168 --> 12:19.168
Mm-hmm.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.973
Is that grandpa?

12:24.414 --> 12:27.016
What was he like?

12:27.017 --> 12:28.448
He was funny.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.382
Liked to dance.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.026
He was a little sad.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.366
(Blows air)

12:50.040 --> 12:51.841
Mom, what is it?

12:51.842 --> 12:55.074
(Footsteps approach)

12:55.075 --> 12:57.877
(Joan) Please put that down.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.778
Mom.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.080
This is daddy's stuff.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.451
You told me you
got rid of everything.

13:02.452 --> 13:05.154
It doesn't belong to you.
Just... just put it down.

13:05.155 --> 13:08.317
Or what, I might
actually feel something?

13:08.318 --> 13:09.819
(Sighs)

13:09.820 --> 13:11.420
When daddy died, it's like...

13:11.421 --> 13:13.292
It's like you erased him.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.895
I guess...

13:15.896 --> 13:17.096
If he never existed,

13:17.097 --> 13:19.198
then he never shot
himself in the head, right?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.369
Megan, this isn't the time.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.501
It's never the time.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.333
For 35 years,

13:24.334 --> 13:26.035
it has not been the time.

13:26.036 --> 13:28.037
Now you're selling the
house, and all that's left of him

13:28.038 --> 13:29.508
is in this little box.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.480
You want me to
get rid of this, too?

13:31.481 --> 13:32.882
I don't want to talk about this.

13:32.883 --> 13:34.043
I do!

13:34.044 --> 13:35.514
Close that box.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.886
No.

13:36.887 --> 13:38.047
Megan.

13:38.048 --> 13:41.020
(Cell phone rings)

13:41.021 --> 13:42.251
For god sake. (Sets box down)

13:42.252 --> 13:43.422
(Rings and beeps)

13:43.423 --> 13:44.593
(Sighs)

13:44.594 --> 13:46.425
What?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.297
I'll be there.

13:48.298 --> 13:49.959
(Beep)

13:49.960 --> 13:52.032
Come on.

13:57.437 --> 14:01.010
(Police radio chatter)

14:01.011 --> 14:03.042
(Tommy) Fancy meeting you here.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.173
What do you got?

14:04.174 --> 14:06.045
Wow. Okay.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.947
Victim is Lori
keyser, 34 years old.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.949
She's a local. This
is a halfway house.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.081
She's been here for three
weeks since she got out of prison.

14:12.082 --> 14:13.582
For doing what?

14:13.583 --> 14:15.424
She did 5 years
of a 30-year term

14:15.425 --> 14:17.086
for killing her ex-boyfriend.

14:17.087 --> 14:20.029
Threw acid in his face.

14:20.030 --> 14:23.132
And now she's had acid
thrown in her face. (Sighs)

14:23.133 --> 14:25.094
(Radio chatter continues)

14:25.095 --> 14:26.896
An eye for an eye.

14:26.897 --> 14:28.267
Looks like we got

14:28.268 --> 14:30.600
another vigilante
murder on our hands.

14:39.409 --> 14:40.910
We're in uncertain times.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.352
And in times like this, we
want to know that someone

14:43.353 --> 14:45.354
is looking out
for our interests.

14:45.355 --> 14:47.987
Not the interests of
lobbyists pocketing...

14:47.988 --> 14:49.358
(Whispers) Damn it.

14:49.359 --> 14:52.661
(Normal voice) Damn
it. Lining the pockets...

14:52.662 --> 14:55.424
Do you have to
do that? I'm sorry.

14:55.425 --> 14:56.625
I thought you were
already giving a statement

14:56.626 --> 14:58.427
on the new vigilante murder,

14:58.428 --> 14:59.568
but that sounded
more like a speech.

14:59.569 --> 15:01.630
Not like a very good one.

15:01.631 --> 15:03.602
Are you announcing
your candidacy?

15:03.603 --> 15:06.105
Tomorrow.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.637
Wow. That's big.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.409
Why didn't you tell me?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.540
Well, because for one thing,

15:11.541 --> 15:13.082
you've accused me
of having divided focus,

15:13.083 --> 15:15.484
and I don't want that again.

15:15.485 --> 15:16.685
Ah.

15:16.686 --> 15:18.687
So you've been burning
the candle at both ends,

15:18.688 --> 15:21.220
and it's weighing on you.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.122
(Chuckles) No, I'm fine.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.394
If that were so, you wouldn't
be wearing your b.D.B.

15:25.395 --> 15:27.096
My what?

15:27.097 --> 15:28.527
Bottom-drawer blouse.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.059
The one you've got on is
much too last season for you.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.100
That, and the fact that
you're wearing the same pants

15:31.101 --> 15:32.331
and shoes as you did yesterday

15:32.332 --> 15:33.502
can mean only one thing.

15:33.503 --> 15:35.334
That you slept on
the couch last night,

15:35.335 --> 15:36.535
pulled out your
b.D.B., freshened up,

15:36.536 --> 15:38.407
thought nobody
would be the wiser.

15:38.408 --> 15:39.568
Do you have an off switch?

15:39.569 --> 15:40.669
No.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.641
(Exhales) I really do
hate you sometimes.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.672
Mm.

15:43.673 --> 15:47.146
Okay, yes, it... It's
weighing on me.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.317
Did you need something?

15:48.318 --> 15:49.618
Yeah, uh, Tommy
and Adam are here.

15:49.619 --> 15:51.320
I thought you might
want to be apprised of

15:51.321 --> 15:54.283
the latest vigilante
murder, but never mind.

15:54.284 --> 15:55.454
No, I do. I do.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.625
No, no.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.127
You work on your speech.

15:58.128 --> 16:00.289
I got this covered.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.660
(Sighs)

16:01.661 --> 16:03.032
Okay.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.634
Let's all get on the
same page here.

16:05.635 --> 16:08.998
Lori keyser's cause of death
was acute respiratory failure

16:08.999 --> 16:12.301
due to inhalation of acid vapor.

16:12.302 --> 16:13.672
Delicate way to put
it. That was nasty.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.704
Curtis is rushing
her tissue to the lab

16:15.705 --> 16:17.206
to see if we can type the acid.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.547
(Adam) And it was an
obvious case of revenge.

16:18.548 --> 16:20.179
Seven years ago,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.650
Lori threw acid in
her ex-boyfriend's face

16:21.651 --> 16:23.652
after he got married
to another woman.

16:23.653 --> 16:26.015
She was convicted
of first-degree murder.

16:26.016 --> 16:27.516
How'd she get out
after five years?

16:27.517 --> 16:29.288
Well... commuted sentence.
Prison overcrowding.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.619
Sign of the times.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.561
Are you gonna try to
solve this one, Tommy,

16:32.562 --> 16:35.664
or is Lori too
unlikable for you?

16:35.665 --> 16:38.027
I've dated worse, as you know.

16:38.028 --> 16:39.628
(Telephone rings)

16:39.629 --> 16:42.771
So... the next
question obviously is,

16:42.772 --> 16:44.633
who would want
to get back at Lori?

16:44.634 --> 16:46.635
How about the wife of
the man that she killed?

16:46.636 --> 16:49.007
Already looked it
up. Since remarried.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.509
Her name is Susan hart.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.580
All right.

16:51.581 --> 16:53.682
Oh, do you want to drive or...

16:53.683 --> 16:57.147
Thank you. Thank you very much.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.219
(Man) Why don't you
give me a call next week,

17:00.220 --> 17:02.051
and, um, we can see...
(Tommy) How you doin'?

17:02.052 --> 17:03.222
Detective Sullivan,
Philadelphia p.D.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.523
Mrs. Hart, your husband
said you would be here.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.594
Could we talk to
you for a moment?

17:05.595 --> 17:07.356
Sorry about the intrusion. Uh...

17:07.357 --> 17:09.798
O-Okay. Wh-what's this about?

17:09.799 --> 17:11.630
Oh, Lori keyser.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.702
She was murdered last night.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.165
I'm sorry. Murdered?

17:16.166 --> 17:17.536
Uh, Susan,

17:17.537 --> 17:19.108
would you, um,

17:19.109 --> 17:20.569
would you... would you
like to use my office?

17:20.570 --> 17:22.141
Yeah, thanks.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.312
Um, please.

17:23.313 --> 17:24.473
Thank you.

17:24.474 --> 17:25.675
(Adam) Thank you. (Man) Mm-hmm.

17:29.479 --> 17:31.550
And you are?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.482
Megan hunt, medical examiner.

17:33.483 --> 17:34.683
Trent marsh.

17:34.684 --> 17:35.655
(Door closes)

17:35.656 --> 17:37.486
That's a...

17:37.487 --> 17:40.490
That's a very effective book.

17:43.493 --> 17:46.064
Did you lose someone to suicide?

17:46.065 --> 17:49.238
I was wondering
whether Susan's mood

17:49.239 --> 17:51.070
was any different today.

17:52.402 --> 17:53.742
(Chuckles)

17:53.743 --> 17:56.475
You know I can't answer
any questions about a patient.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.777
But a Valiant attempt
to change the subject

17:58.778 --> 18:01.110
away from yourself. (Chuckles)

18:01.111 --> 18:02.681
I thought that was
supposed to be my job.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.813
And are you good
at it, your job?

18:04.814 --> 18:07.286
I'd like to think so.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.488
I'm sorry. I just... i'm...
I'm having a hard time

18:09.489 --> 18:11.360
processing what
you're telling me.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.592
Lori keyser was... killed

18:13.593 --> 18:15.824
and...

18:15.825 --> 18:17.666
With acid?

18:17.667 --> 18:20.499
This killing could be
seen as poetic justice.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.171
And of course,

18:22.172 --> 18:24.303
you suspect me.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.575
Oh, my god. I...

18:26.576 --> 18:29.338
Lori was a disturbed woman.

18:29.339 --> 18:31.680
I-I could never do
anything like that.

18:31.681 --> 18:33.212
Your new husband

18:33.213 --> 18:35.384
doesn't seem to think
you've gotten over your loss.

18:35.385 --> 18:38.147
Bill doesn't understand me.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.619
Not at all.

18:40.620 --> 18:45.225
As if I could just
forget and... move on.

18:46.456 --> 18:48.597
Jeffrey's murder split
my life in two parts,

18:48.598 --> 18:51.630
into a before and after.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.364
And all the things I've
done since that day

18:55.365 --> 18:56.735
to pass the time...

18:56.736 --> 18:59.208
My... job,

18:59.209 --> 19:02.571
my hobbies, my...

19:02.572 --> 19:04.844
Current marriage...

19:07.647 --> 19:10.650
Just distractions to...

19:12.582 --> 19:14.783
But necessary ones,

19:14.784 --> 19:16.485
because without
them, I honestly,

19:16.486 --> 19:18.857
I don't know what I'd do.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.660
What happened to
your hand, Mrs. Hart?

19:21.731 --> 19:24.763
Um...

19:24.764 --> 19:27.666
I burned myself this morning

19:27.667 --> 19:31.170
while I was cooking breakfast.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.244
I specialize in...

19:35.245 --> 19:36.905
Grief counseling.

19:36.906 --> 19:38.747
And though the
loss of a loved one

19:38.748 --> 19:40.909
is extremely difficult

19:40.910 --> 19:42.551
in any case,

19:42.552 --> 19:45.484
survivors of
suicide tend to have

19:45.485 --> 19:47.556
the most difficult

19:47.557 --> 19:48.687
grief journey.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.659
Those who lose
someone to homicide

19:50.660 --> 19:53.522
have a target for their
anger... the person

19:53.523 --> 19:55.193
who took their loved
one out of the world.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.596
But with suicide,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.868
the target of your anger

19:59.869 --> 20:04.234
is the same person
you're also mourning.

20:06.436 --> 20:09.238
If you don't mind me asking...

20:09.239 --> 20:10.509
Who did you lose?

20:10.510 --> 20:12.911
(Huffs) I really should
get back to my colleagues.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.583
Megan, you don't need
to run away from this...

20:14.584 --> 20:15.914
It's Dr. Hunt.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.286
(Door opens)

20:17.287 --> 20:19.448
(Tommy) Let's go.

20:19.449 --> 20:20.919
She's coming with
us. Nice office. Thanks.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.423
Absolutely. Um, please.

20:24.854 --> 20:26.656
Please take it.

20:28.658 --> 20:31.801
And if you ever need
to talk, here's my card.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.846
(Sighs)

20:52.882 --> 20:55.724
(Knock on door)

20:55.725 --> 20:57.326
(Sets book down)

20:57.327 --> 20:58.627
(Sets glass down)

20:58.628 --> 21:00.290
(Lock clicks)

21:04.334 --> 21:05.795
Hi.

21:07.337 --> 21:09.699
I'm sorry about before.

21:11.441 --> 21:14.944
You made me realize, it's time.

21:16.646 --> 21:18.748
You should have this.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.511
You know, I never
told you before,

21:22.512 --> 21:24.583
but when people used to
ask me about your father,

21:24.584 --> 21:27.986
I told them he
had a heart attack.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.960
I was so afraid of
what they would think.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.394
I blamed myself...

21:35.395 --> 21:37.626
For not seeing the signs,

21:37.627 --> 21:40.599
for not realizing
that he was in pain,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.532
and for not being
a good enough wife

21:43.533 --> 21:45.033
to make him want to stay alive.

21:45.034 --> 21:47.035
I would've been there for you...

21:47.036 --> 21:49.638
If you'd let me.

21:49.639 --> 21:51.410
You were 12, Megan.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.542
It's a mother's job to
shield her children from pain,

21:53.543 --> 21:54.743
not dwell on it.

21:54.744 --> 21:56.685
That's why I took
everything out of the house.

21:56.686 --> 21:58.347
You know, I just thought that...

21:58.348 --> 22:00.318
(Sighs deeply)

22:00.319 --> 22:02.091
I only wanted to protect you.

22:20.910 --> 22:24.012
What i... what is
this, a suicide note?

22:24.013 --> 22:27.746
How is that... the... the
police never found one.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.819
That's because I found it first.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.981
And what, you
just... You kept this?

22:32.982 --> 22:34.753
You hid this all these years?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.084
The deed was done.

22:36.085 --> 22:38.427
I was ashamed, all right?

22:38.428 --> 22:40.729
Why do you keep questioning me

22:40.730 --> 22:42.731
about something that
happened a lifetime ago?

22:42.732 --> 22:45.363
The coward killed
himself, Megan.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.695
What if he didn't?

22:46.696 --> 22:48.937
Oh, please. Not that
conversation again.

22:48.938 --> 22:50.739
I know that your precious father

22:50.740 --> 22:52.641
can do no wrong in your eyes.

22:52.642 --> 22:53.603
How could he?

22:53.604 --> 22:55.744
He hasn't had 35 years

22:55.745 --> 22:58.907
to become the disappointment
to you that I obviously have.

22:58.908 --> 23:01.379
Why now? Why are you
showing this to me now?

23:01.380 --> 23:04.112
Because I think you should
stop living under the assumption

23:04.113 --> 23:06.585
that there's an answer
to every question.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.086
Why did he do it?

23:08.087 --> 23:09.588
I don't know.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.160
But give it up, Megan. I did.

23:12.161 --> 23:14.894
No. Never.

23:29.879 --> 23:31.039
(Bell dings)

23:31.040 --> 23:32.180
(Curtis) It's almost lunch time.

23:32.181 --> 23:33.882
Where the hell you been?

23:33.883 --> 23:35.814
Everybody and they
mama calling my line.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.046
Oh, I knew I should've
taken a personal day.

23:38.047 --> 23:40.018
You don't take personal
days, remember?

23:40.019 --> 23:42.851
I got an update on your
murder victim Lori keyser.

23:42.852 --> 23:45.023
She was doused
with hydrofluoric acid.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.925
Our suspect Susan hart
had a burn on her arm.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.196
Same acid?

23:48.197 --> 23:50.459
No, ma'am. Susan was
burned with cooking oil.

23:50.460 --> 23:51.700
She was telling the truth.

23:51.701 --> 23:53.061
Her alibi checks out, too.

23:53.062 --> 23:54.963
Great. Another dead end.

23:54.964 --> 23:56.605
Well, p.D.'S widening
their search grid

23:56.606 --> 23:57.966
around the crime scene,

23:57.967 --> 23:59.908
looking for any
container of that acid.

23:59.909 --> 24:01.570
Lacey.

24:01.571 --> 24:03.071
Why are you...

24:03.072 --> 24:04.613
We were supposed to go to lunch.

24:04.614 --> 24:07.015
What, did you forget?

24:07.016 --> 24:10.078
No. I did not.

24:10.079 --> 24:13.021
(Curtis) No, ma'am. I don't...

24:13.022 --> 24:14.953
Hold on. Now where you goin'?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.124
You just got here.

24:16.125 --> 24:18.086
Guess I'm taking that
personal day after all.

24:18.087 --> 24:20.589
Well, why don't
everybody just go home?

24:20.590 --> 24:22.461
Bye, lace.

24:26.195 --> 24:30.098
(Indistinct conversations)

24:30.099 --> 24:32.071
Did you make up
with grandma yet?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.074
We don't make up,
honey. We endure.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.809
I know things with you
two can get... complicated.

24:41.010 --> 24:42.911
(Sets utensils down)

24:42.912 --> 24:44.212
I know you're mad at grandma

24:44.213 --> 24:46.054
because she never
talks about grandpa,

24:46.055 --> 24:49.918
but you don't talk
about him either.

24:49.919 --> 24:52.020
(Chuckles) Yes, I do.

24:52.021 --> 24:53.922
Well...

24:53.923 --> 24:55.263
It's been a long time,

24:55.264 --> 24:57.897
and... and... and
he's not around, but...

25:00.069 --> 25:02.932
I think about him. I do.

25:05.034 --> 25:07.035
Mom, when I was kidnapped,

25:07.036 --> 25:08.977
you had me start
seeing that therapist.

25:08.978 --> 25:11.139
She's really helped me a lot.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.682
What about you?

25:13.683 --> 25:15.684
I mean, maybe you
could see someone, too,

25:15.685 --> 25:17.986
and talk about all your stuff.

25:17.987 --> 25:21.119
(Huffs) "My stuff"?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.852
Maybe if you get to know
yourself a little better,

25:23.853 --> 25:26.024
it would help me get
to know you better, too.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.095
What?

25:27.096 --> 25:30.098
Fine. My therapist
told me to say that.

25:30.099 --> 25:31.900
I'm shocked.

25:31.901 --> 25:35.533
You talk to your therapist
about me, your own mother?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.535
Maybe just... a little.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.967
Mm-hmm.

25:38.968 --> 25:40.669
I have to go to the restroom.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.171
Yeah. Quick escape.

25:43.172 --> 25:46.175
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

25:49.979 --> 25:52.922
(Sighs)

25:58.227 --> 25:59.588
(Clears throat)

25:59.589 --> 26:01.760
This is a safe place, Megan.

26:01.761 --> 26:05.093
Just relax.

26:05.094 --> 26:06.935
So how does this
work? What do i...

26:06.936 --> 26:07.996
Am I...

26:07.997 --> 26:11.099
Whatever makes you comfortable.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.602
Not lying down.

26:13.603 --> 26:15.103
(Chuckles) All right.

26:15.104 --> 26:16.975
Why don't we start by just...

26:16.976 --> 26:20.108
Telling me what you
remember about the incident

26:20.109 --> 26:21.610
when you lost someone?

26:21.611 --> 26:24.112
(Sighs)

26:24.113 --> 26:25.985
Okay.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.889
Um...

26:30.890 --> 26:32.721
I was 12.

26:32.722 --> 26:35.724
I was, um, walking
home from school...

26:35.725 --> 26:37.125
(Inhales deeply)

26:37.126 --> 26:39.097
By myself, as usual.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.199
It was hot that day...

26:41.200 --> 26:43.872
Unseasonably so.

26:43.873 --> 26:45.173
And I was walking
towards my house.

26:45.174 --> 26:46.875
I saw lights.

26:46.876 --> 26:49.137
There were police cars.

26:49.138 --> 26:51.840
And, uh, I walked
towards the porch.

26:51.841 --> 26:53.842
This policeman came up to me,

26:53.843 --> 26:57.686
told me my mother wasn't home.

26:57.687 --> 26:59.818
Then he just kind of
looked at me and said,

26:59.819 --> 27:01.750
"your father's dead."

27:01.751 --> 27:03.752
And I sat on the porch for,

27:03.753 --> 27:06.695
um, 40 minutes, by myself,

27:06.696 --> 27:10.258
wondering who was going to

27:10.259 --> 27:13.802
water the plants that
were right by the front door,

27:13.803 --> 27:15.233
'cause that was my father's job.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.766
He always took care of
them, and... (Chuckles)

27:17.767 --> 27:19.067
Who's gonna water them now?

27:19.068 --> 27:21.069
(Chuckles) I know it
sounds really stupid, but...

27:21.070 --> 27:23.672
No.

27:23.673 --> 27:25.775
No, it's never stupid.

27:29.148 --> 27:33.121
There's no right
way to deal with loss.

27:33.122 --> 27:36.925
And as I mentioned,
suicide bereavement can be

27:36.926 --> 27:38.226
one of the toughest
to deal with.

27:38.227 --> 27:41.090
For one, survivors tend
to feel a lot more guilt.

27:42.692 --> 27:43.893
Did you?

27:47.797 --> 27:50.869
(Voice breaking) I
thought that, um...

27:50.870 --> 27:54.142
He was mad at me,

27:54.143 --> 27:56.304
that I was bad.

27:56.305 --> 27:57.846
Why else would he do it?

27:57.847 --> 28:00.149
Why else would
he leave me alone?

28:02.111 --> 28:03.411
(Sighs)

28:03.412 --> 28:05.784
The trouble is,
most suicide victims

28:05.785 --> 28:07.685
rarely offer up...

28:07.686 --> 28:09.157
A true motive.

28:09.158 --> 28:11.891
Did he leave a note?

28:14.293 --> 28:17.695
I think that, um... I
should go back to work.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.867
No, Megan, we...

28:18.868 --> 28:20.028
I'm sorry.

28:20.029 --> 28:21.330
We've only just begun, Megan.

28:41.190 --> 28:42.720
(Megan) Hey.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.022
Thought you had a
personal day today.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.353
I just saw Paul winters.

28:45.354 --> 28:47.055
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Our
shooting suspect, where?

28:47.056 --> 28:48.356
I was at the therapist's
office again...

28:48.357 --> 28:50.198
The same th... don't ask why.

28:50.199 --> 28:52.060
And he was
waiting in the office.

28:52.061 --> 28:53.431
He's a patient.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.764
So the same therapist who's
been treating Susan hart?

28:55.765 --> 28:56.935
That's not a coincidence.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.966
Both of our cases,
they gotta be linked.

28:57.967 --> 28:59.307
Yeah, but there's no evidence

28:59.308 --> 29:01.269
they got vengeance on
their loved ones' killers.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.242
No, but what if they
killed for each other?

29:18.487 --> 29:20.488
We've got two murders,

29:20.489 --> 29:22.260
two suspects,

29:22.261 --> 29:24.532
and both of 'em
have airtight alibis.

29:24.533 --> 29:27.435
And they're seeing
the same therapist.

29:27.436 --> 29:29.397
Maybe they bonded
over their grief

29:29.398 --> 29:31.099
in the waiting room.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.201
So they do a little crisscross

29:33.202 --> 29:34.973
to get revenge,

29:34.974 --> 29:37.005
like "strangers on a train"?

29:37.006 --> 29:38.446
Kill for each other,
no one suspects.

29:38.447 --> 29:40.248
It's the perfect crime.

29:40.249 --> 29:41.409
Not if we can prove conspiracy.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.111
We just link them up
to each other's murders.

29:43.112 --> 29:44.482
The lab's working on overdrive,

29:44.483 --> 29:46.484
trying to match
the sunflower seeds

29:46.485 --> 29:48.256
from the shooting
scene to Susan.

29:48.257 --> 29:49.557
What about the acid crime scene?

29:49.558 --> 29:51.259
C.s.u. Found a plastic bottle

29:51.260 --> 29:52.921
about 5 blocks away
from that halfway house

29:52.922 --> 29:54.792
with hydrofluoric acid inside.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.365
So they're running the
bottle for prints and d.N.A.,

29:57.366 --> 30:00.498
with the hope that they
can match it to Paul.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.569
Yeah, but look at them.

30:01.570 --> 30:03.801
They look hardly
capable of murder.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.134
Under the influence of grief,

30:06.135 --> 30:07.877
anything's possible.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.039
Oh.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.340
Great.

30:12.341 --> 30:13.882
Now you're saying I've...

30:13.883 --> 30:15.443
I've killed some woman
I've never even met?

30:15.444 --> 30:17.285
Well, that would be
the point, wouldn't it?

30:17.286 --> 30:19.317
You kill for Susan
hart, she kills for you.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.990
Susan who? This is crazy.

30:21.991 --> 30:23.992
Paul, Paul...

30:23.993 --> 30:27.495
I can't help you if
you don't talk to me.

30:27.496 --> 30:29.127
Now you've been through
enough, haven't you?

30:29.128 --> 30:31.199
Y-You're right. I have.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.460
I'm not saying another word.

30:32.461 --> 30:33.902
Not till you get me my lawyer.

30:33.903 --> 30:35.103
(Susan, crying) No.

30:35.104 --> 30:37.505
No, I only know who
Paul winters is because

30:37.506 --> 30:39.467
I saw him on TV. I swear.

30:39.468 --> 30:41.469
Susan, I know you don't think

30:41.470 --> 30:42.971
that anybody could
possibly understand

30:42.972 --> 30:44.973
all the emotions that you're
going through right now

30:44.974 --> 30:46.444
since your husband
was taken away from you,

30:46.445 --> 30:50.018
but I want you to know that
I do, more than you know.

30:50.019 --> 30:51.419
And I can understand

30:51.420 --> 30:53.251
why you'd want his killer
to pay for what she did.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.023
No, please, stop
talking about it. Stop.

30:55.024 --> 30:56.524
Susan, did you kill
Freddie delgado?

30:56.525 --> 30:58.326
No! (Sobs)

30:58.327 --> 31:00.558
I don't know who he is.

31:00.559 --> 31:04.062
I don't know him.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.234
(Continues crying) Please stop.

31:06.235 --> 31:07.495
(Door closes)

31:07.496 --> 31:10.538
Susan's not talking.

31:10.539 --> 31:12.070
Yeah, well, Paul lawyered up.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.371
If they think we're on to them,

31:13.372 --> 31:15.243
that's their last recourse.

31:15.244 --> 31:17.205
They can't admit to
knowing each other.

31:17.206 --> 31:18.506
She's about to
crack. Look at her.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.048
I just need some more time.

31:20.049 --> 31:22.010
(Cell phone rings and beeps)

31:22.011 --> 31:25.253
Yeah, detective Lucas.

31:25.254 --> 31:28.356
Uh, yeah.

31:28.357 --> 31:31.019
Yeah, that can't be. Can
you check it out again, please?

31:31.020 --> 31:33.291
Okay. Thank you.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.392
(Beep) Well, that was the lab.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.394
Everything's a bust.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.565
What's going on?

31:37.566 --> 31:39.427
D.n.a. From both crime
scenes came back.

31:39.428 --> 31:40.929
No matches to Paul or Susan.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.031
They didn't kill
each other's targets.

31:43.032 --> 31:44.502
Great. That's all we had.
We're back to square one.

31:44.503 --> 31:45.673
Not quite.

31:45.674 --> 31:47.135
Uh, you won't believe why.

31:47.136 --> 31:49.207
Both d.N.A. Profiles?
They're identical.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.478
Wait a minute.

31:50.479 --> 31:52.440
The same person
killed both victims?

31:52.441 --> 31:54.442
Well, the only thing
connecting both crimes

31:54.443 --> 31:56.284
is that therapist.

31:56.285 --> 31:57.585
(Sighs)

31:57.586 --> 32:00.348
Dr. Trent marsh.

32:00.349 --> 32:03.651
Dr. Marsh, our shrink,
has quite the background.

32:03.652 --> 32:07.056
Ten years ago, his wife was
murdered in their own house.

32:09.498 --> 32:11.159
Was he a suspect?

32:11.160 --> 32:13.931
Naturally, as the husband,
but he was ruled out early on

32:13.932 --> 32:17.135
'cause homicide
had one guy in mind.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.367
Nathan Jarvis, ex-con
who'd done some time

32:19.368 --> 32:21.309
for sexual assault.

32:21.310 --> 32:22.470
Was he charged?

32:22.471 --> 32:24.642
Detained. Released
due to lack of evidence.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.345
So this case was never solved?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.347
(Sighs)

32:29.348 --> 32:31.980
A year later, marsh
went back to school,

32:31.981 --> 32:33.481
got his phd in
clinical psychology,

32:33.482 --> 32:34.652
opened up his own practice,

32:34.653 --> 32:36.354
specializing in
bereavement counseling.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.027
This guy has been immersed
in grief for the last ten years.

32:39.028 --> 32:40.528
I mean, it's only natural
he'd go off the deep end,

32:40.529 --> 32:42.390
but why now?

32:42.391 --> 32:45.063
Maybe he wants to give
Paul and Susan some kind of...

32:45.064 --> 32:46.494
Closure.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.496
Adam went to our
offsite storage facility

32:48.497 --> 32:51.199
to dig up the file
from the wife's murder.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.202
D.n.a. Reference samples
got to include marsh at that time.

32:54.203 --> 32:56.374
As soon as we match his
profile to our two crime scenes,

32:56.375 --> 32:57.646
we got him.

32:59.108 --> 33:03.351
You really went to
this guy for therapy?

33:03.352 --> 33:05.053
What'd you tell him?

33:05.054 --> 33:06.655
(Sighs) Enough.

33:09.718 --> 33:12.121
Now we make him talk.

33:22.471 --> 33:24.772
Thanks for coming down
to the station, Dr. Marsh.

33:24.773 --> 33:27.335
I was hoping you
could shed some light

33:27.336 --> 33:29.006
on a couple of
open investigations

33:29.007 --> 33:30.308
I have going right now.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.479
Certainly.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.343
Two people killed by
acts of vengeance...

33:35.344 --> 33:38.046
Both of them killed
in the exact same way

33:38.047 --> 33:40.148
that they killed someone else.

33:40.149 --> 33:41.120
I see.

33:41.121 --> 33:42.290
Yeah.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.092
My prime suspects

33:44.093 --> 33:45.693
are both patients of yours...

33:45.694 --> 33:48.126
Paul winters and Susan hart.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.597
That's, uh...

33:49.598 --> 33:51.759
(Inhales deeply)
That's troublesome.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.462
Uh... well, as you know,

33:54.463 --> 33:57.065
doctor-patient confidentiality

33:57.066 --> 33:58.406
would normally preclude me

33:58.407 --> 34:01.339
from talking about my clients,

34:01.340 --> 34:05.773
but under the circumstances...

34:05.774 --> 34:09.247
Uh, when I counsel
survivors of homicide,

34:09.248 --> 34:11.249
I do have them focus
their anger towards

34:11.250 --> 34:14.482
whoever's responsible for
the loss of their loved ones.

34:14.483 --> 34:18.656
Just so they can get to
a place of forgiveness,

34:18.657 --> 34:20.158
in order to allow
the healing to begin.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.759
I just hope

34:21.760 --> 34:24.462
I'm not in some way...

34:24.463 --> 34:26.234
Responsible.

34:26.235 --> 34:28.137
I think you are.

34:29.498 --> 34:30.668
Not for the same reason,

34:30.669 --> 34:31.799
but Paul and Susan,
they're innocent.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.402
They haven't killed anybody.

34:34.403 --> 34:35.743
But one person did,

34:35.744 --> 34:38.176
and the only thing those
cases have in common...

34:38.177 --> 34:39.478
Is you.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.080
So you're leaping
to the conclusion

34:43.081 --> 34:44.412
that I must have done it.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.754
(Chuckles) Have you deduced
what my possible motive

34:46.755 --> 34:48.116
could be as well?

34:48.117 --> 34:49.257
There's your history.

34:49.258 --> 34:51.259
Your wife was murdered.

34:51.260 --> 34:53.361
The killer was never caught.

34:53.362 --> 34:55.163
Meaning what,

34:55.164 --> 34:56.694
I'm dissociating?

34:56.695 --> 35:00.868
Murdering others
to feed my desire

35:00.869 --> 35:03.301
for closure that I haven't
been able to attain?

35:03.302 --> 35:04.672
I like that.

35:04.673 --> 35:07.135
Oh, now you're really thinking.

35:07.136 --> 35:10.508
(Laughs) Look, it's true...

35:10.509 --> 35:12.280
My wife

35:12.281 --> 35:14.742
does remain unspoken for,

35:14.743 --> 35:17.545
like so many.

35:17.546 --> 35:20.288
Think of all the families
shattered every minute

35:20.289 --> 35:25.323
because of someone
else's selfish homicidal whim.

35:25.324 --> 35:28.856
The... ripple effects
of that single act,

35:28.857 --> 35:33.601
psychologically damaging
possible generations to follow.

35:33.602 --> 35:38.666
And yet so many of
those killers walk free...

35:38.667 --> 35:40.838
From a lack of evidence,

35:40.839 --> 35:42.770
because of red tape,

35:42.771 --> 35:44.242
technicalities.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.413
We try.

35:45.414 --> 35:46.574
You fail.

35:46.575 --> 35:48.876
But you sought to rectify that.

35:48.877 --> 35:52.350
Kill the killers yourself.
Make sure justice was served?

35:52.351 --> 35:55.653
(Chuckles) See,
again, you try, you fail...

35:55.654 --> 35:59.156
Wasting your time accusing me.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.288
Look, I'm happy to
go through the motions

36:00.289 --> 36:02.230
if it'll justify your paycheck.

36:02.231 --> 36:04.392
Search my house, take
my prints, my d.N.A...

36:04.393 --> 36:06.864
Whatever it is you do nowadays.

36:06.865 --> 36:10.238
I am not a murderer, detective.

36:10.239 --> 36:12.400
And even if I were,

36:12.401 --> 36:14.842
I'm sure you couldn't
prove it anyway.

36:14.843 --> 36:17.446
Tommy.

36:22.751 --> 36:25.883
Please tell you got
something to nail this guy.

36:25.884 --> 36:26.855
Trent's d.N.A. Doesn't match

36:26.856 --> 36:28.216
the d.N.A. From
our crime scenes.

36:28.217 --> 36:29.557
You're kidding me. What?

36:29.558 --> 36:30.888
No, but here's the
really messed up part...

36:30.889 --> 36:34.322
When c.S.U. Was typing
the d.N.A. From the old case,

36:34.323 --> 36:35.863
another sample popped up.

36:35.864 --> 36:37.695
Nathan Jarvis.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.828
That's the prime suspect
in the murder of Trent's wife.

36:40.829 --> 36:41.969
Seems impossible, I
know, but then it hit me,

36:41.970 --> 36:43.501
so I looked up Jarvis,
and guess what.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.833
A year ago, he went
missing and was never found.

36:45.834 --> 36:48.376
It's him. I know
it. He's behind it.

36:48.377 --> 36:49.807
(Megan) Trent killed Jarvis.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.980
He puts Jarvis' d.N.A.
At his murder scenes.

36:52.981 --> 36:54.582
The seeds, the acid container,

36:54.583 --> 36:57.685
all he has to do is put them
in contact with Jarvis' body

36:57.686 --> 37:00.818
to get his epithelials on them.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.750
One big screw
you to Philly's finest.

37:02.751 --> 37:04.852
Yeah. Guess what. It worked.

37:04.853 --> 37:06.754
(Huffs)

37:06.755 --> 37:09.828
He's getting away with murder.

37:14.263 --> 37:16.734
(Kate) And I promise

37:16.735 --> 37:18.536
that I will represent
the priorities and values

37:18.537 --> 37:19.837
of this great city

37:19.838 --> 37:22.310
while cutting through
the partisan paralysis

37:22.311 --> 37:24.011
that's choking Washington.

37:24.012 --> 37:26.574
All I'm asking is that
you give me that chance.

37:26.575 --> 37:28.416
I won't let you down. Thank you.

37:28.417 --> 37:29.577
You looked pretty
great up there.

37:29.578 --> 37:30.918
Oh, Dan.

37:30.919 --> 37:32.750
Auspicious start
to your campaign.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.921
(Sets remote down)

37:33.922 --> 37:34.883
Presented your platform,

37:34.884 --> 37:36.584
thanked the right people,

37:36.585 --> 37:38.356
made all the right promises.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.288
I'm surprised you weren't there

37:40.289 --> 37:41.629
to watch over your investment.

37:41.630 --> 37:42.790
I would've been, believe me,

37:42.791 --> 37:44.031
but the day job called.

37:44.032 --> 37:47.435
You've been apprised
of the Trent marsh case?

37:47.436 --> 37:48.896
Disturbing.

37:48.897 --> 37:49.997
Well, he just walked.

37:49.998 --> 37:51.839
How is that possible?

37:51.840 --> 37:53.341
There wasn't a shred
of hard evidence

37:53.342 --> 37:55.272
connecting him to either murder.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.576
We couldn't make
a case against him.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.708
Look, we know he
killed those people,

38:00.709 --> 38:03.511
but there's absolutely
nothing we can do about it.

38:03.512 --> 38:04.982
I really don't want
to believe that.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.484
Neither do it.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.985
But unfortunately, in my office,

38:07.986 --> 38:09.487
we don't practice justice, Kate.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.820
We practice law.

38:21.930 --> 38:22.901
(Door creaks)

38:22.902 --> 38:24.772
Megan.

38:24.773 --> 38:26.834
What a lovely surprise.

38:26.835 --> 38:29.707
Did you want to make
another appointment?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.979
This is yours.

38:31.980 --> 38:33.742
I don't want it.

38:37.946 --> 38:40.549
You're rather brave,
to come here all alone.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.623
Aren't I a diabolical killer?

38:45.624 --> 38:48.055
Well, you only kill people
you think deserve it.

38:48.056 --> 38:50.398
Mm.

38:50.399 --> 38:51.859
I'm very sorry...

38:51.860 --> 38:54.802
About what
happened to your wife.

38:54.803 --> 38:56.804
I deal with the bereaved

38:56.805 --> 38:58.906
in my line of work all the time.

38:58.907 --> 39:01.569
And I never get used to it,

39:01.570 --> 39:04.642
seeing people on the
worst day of their lives.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.814
Grief is messy.

39:06.815 --> 39:07.915
It's raw.

39:07.916 --> 39:09.076
(Huffs)

39:09.077 --> 39:12.881
It makes people do
unimaginable things.

39:16.084 --> 39:18.886
Do you really think that
by identifying with me,

39:18.887 --> 39:21.429
you'll trick me into
some sort of admission?

39:21.430 --> 39:23.861
Oh, no. You're way
too smart for that.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.433
I came as a warning.

39:25.434 --> 39:26.764
A warning?

39:26.765 --> 39:28.436
You may think you've
helped your clients

39:28.437 --> 39:30.938
by giving them
some kind of closure.

39:30.939 --> 39:32.970
What about your victims?

39:32.971 --> 39:36.474
What about the loved
ones they've left behind?

39:36.475 --> 39:38.806
Aren't they gonna want closure,

39:38.807 --> 39:41.949
seek revenge?

39:41.950 --> 39:45.883
What if they find out
what you've done?

39:45.884 --> 39:47.915
Is that some sort of threat?

39:47.916 --> 39:49.196
If you want to see it like that.

39:54.863 --> 39:58.896
When it's my time...

39:58.897 --> 40:01.930
It's my time.

40:06.004 --> 40:09.006
And until then,

40:09.007 --> 40:11.879
I have a lot more patients...

40:11.880 --> 40:14.782
That could do with my help.

40:14.783 --> 40:16.884
Not if I have
anything to do with it.

40:16.885 --> 40:18.886
You're sicker than any of them.

40:18.887 --> 40:21.520
Oh, you don't really
mean that, do you?

40:23.592 --> 40:27.695
I wish I could spend some
more time with you, Megan.

40:27.696 --> 40:30.759
I'd really love to chat
about your daddy.

40:33.832 --> 40:36.734
Any chance I'll be
seeing you again?

40:36.735 --> 40:39.707
Eventually...

40:39.708 --> 40:41.940
Everyone does.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.490
(Indistinct conversations)

41:02.491 --> 41:04.231
Don't you ever go home?

41:04.232 --> 41:05.793
Don't you?

41:05.794 --> 41:06.964
Needed a breather.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.896
Marsh got a little
under my skin.

41:08.897 --> 41:10.998
Sociopaths tend to do that.

41:10.999 --> 41:12.671
Your therapist.

41:14.102 --> 41:17.075
So you ready to tell me
why you went to see him?

41:27.686 --> 41:29.887
What's this?

41:29.888 --> 41:32.520
A favor.

41:32.521 --> 41:34.192
(Sighs)

41:36.224 --> 41:39.126
"I have a heavy heart
because of what I need to do.

41:39.127 --> 41:41.929
"To those who will
read this, I'm truly sorry.

41:41.930 --> 41:44.532
But this world is not for me."

41:44.533 --> 41:46.003
It's my father's suicide note,

41:46.004 --> 41:49.236
which my mother has
kept hidden for 35 years.

41:49.237 --> 41:51.679
No wonder you've been
in such a weird head space.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.542
Megan, I am so sorry.

41:55.584 --> 41:58.646
I need you to run
it through the lab...

41:58.647 --> 42:01.819
Prints, d.N.A. Handwriting
analysis, the works.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.821
You know I'm not
supposed to tie up the lab

42:03.822 --> 42:05.092
with personal use,

42:05.093 --> 42:07.155
which means we
can't tell a soul.

42:09.297 --> 42:11.729
But just one question.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.001
Why?

42:14.002 --> 42:17.265
Because I don't believe
a word in that note.

42:19.608 --> 42:23.571
My father did not kill himself.

42:23.572 --> 42:25.273
I know it.
