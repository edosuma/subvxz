Okay, Rich, this is it.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.536
Your dream come true, buddy.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.875
-(Alfred laughs)
- Hey, Al.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.414
- Hi. Hi. Hi.
- Al. -Hi, Al.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.677
Okay, what are you going
to have, huh? Richie?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.286
Nothing for me, Al.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.649
Me, either.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.120
Oh, me, either.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.157
Me, either.

02:05.292 --> 02:09.490
Three "me, eithers"

02:09.630 --> 02:12.064
Okay, nobody eats, huh?

02:12.199 --> 02:14.895
And I'm trying
to run a business.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.401
So, you guys are going
to have a party, huh?

02:17.537 --> 02:20.632
A party?
It's not just a party.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.173
W: a <i>parry</i> party!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.572
The biggest!

02:23.710 --> 02:26.441
It's a Potsie and Ralph
extravaganza!

02:26.580 --> 02:28.639
It's a "welcome Hawaii
to the statehood" party.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.217
We sent invitations
all over campus, Rich.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.547
- POTSIE: Yeah. -Yeah, but
I already gave a Hawaii party.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.179
Who cares? It'll bring chicks
to the apartment.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.383
Our own apartment,
wall-to-wall couches.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.392
Lots of making out.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.622
- Oh.
-(chuckling)

02:43.764 --> 02:46.494
Well, that sounds, uh,
kind of Hawaiian.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.828
POTSIE:
Yeah.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.492
What do you think, Lori Beth?

02:49.636 --> 02:53.368
- Uh, well, I guess it's better
than us shooting baskets. -Yeah.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.135
Well, I-l like to shoot baskets.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.005
You know,
she-she rebounds for me.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.841
I'm getting pretty good.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.107
Yeah.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.739
Listen, I got to go
to the sorority house.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.579
- All right.
- Um, I've got kitchen duty.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.845
- All right.
- Okay. -See you later.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.046
- Bye-bye.
- See you, Lori Beth. -Mmm.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.180
See you, Sizzle Lips.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.696
I really like college life.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.320
I'm thinking
about dropping journalism,

03:18.465 --> 03:20.456
and just majoring in lips.

03:22.269 --> 03:25.204
By the way, Sizzle Lips,
can we borrow a couple of bucks?

03:25.338 --> 03:26.704
What for?

03:26.840 --> 03:27.864
For refreshments.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.407
Dip doesn't grow on trees,
you know.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.567
(laughter)

03:30.710 --> 03:31.973
- I still got it.
- You do.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.080
Hi. What's so funny?
Did I miss something?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.741
You sure did.
I told another side splitter.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.478
Oh, good.
I didn't miss anything.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.781
Rich, Mom wants you to
bring home a loaf of rye bread.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.893
Oh, all right.
Uh, with or without seeds?

03:47.027 --> 03:50.053
Seeds? We're going to eat it,
not plant it.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.687
(laughs)

03:51.832 --> 03:53.265
I've still got it.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.533
Hey, Fonzie!

04:02.676 --> 04:05.167
Good seeing you, Fonz.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.472
All right, gentlemen.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.513
All right, introduce yourselves
to Blossom here.

04:08.648 --> 04:09.741
Hi.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.375
She's a bunny
at Happy Harry's Hutch.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.951
Well, I can certainly see
why Harry's happy.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.615
(Potsie laughs)

04:18.757 --> 04:20.226
A bunny?

04:20.360 --> 04:21.827
I thought
she was a shapely Q-tip.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.193
(laughter)

04:25.332 --> 04:26.663
That's it, that's it.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.666
Put your eyes back
in your sockets, all right?

04:28.802 --> 04:30.065
I got a message
from your mother.

04:30.203 --> 04:33.298
She wants you to come home
with a... a loaf of rye bread.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.431
RALPH:
Fonz, this is your lucky day.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.477
Because this Saturday, we are
having a blast at our apartment.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.944
It's our "welcome Hawaii
to statehood" party.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.777
And you and your friend
are invited.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.578
- Saturday, huh?
- RALPH: Yeah.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.186
Well, I'll tell you something,
gentlemen.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.811
I'm very sorry I can't make it.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.548
Saturday, I'm taking Blossom
to dinner.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.888
I want to see just about
how much bunny she really is.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.954
Order her a salad.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.463
Come on, Fonz.
Our party's going to be better.

05:01.601 --> 05:02.967
It's a college party.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.400
- A college party?
Are you kidding? -College?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.802
Oh, I just love
intellectual men.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.271
Oh, please, Fonz, let's go.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.376
Well, I'll tell you something.
I...

05:10.510 --> 05:12.001
We're going.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.272
All right, all right.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.143
You know,
it's a come-as-you-are...

05:15.282 --> 05:16.340
or less, party-

05:16.483 --> 05:17.848
You're all set.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.850
- Hey, uh, Ralph, Ralph.
- RALPH: She's all set.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.012
Yeah, right.
Uh, stop panting, will you?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.249
Because you're going
to wilt her ears from there.

05:24.391 --> 05:27.087
Listen, why don't we hop over
to my place? You get it?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.922
Hop over to my place?
Hop over...

05:29.062 --> 05:31.292
Whoa!

05:34.701 --> 05:36.760
RALPH: Come on, Pots, let's get
over to the fraternity house.

05:36.903 --> 05:37.927
- All right. Bye, Rich.
- See you.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.505
We got to borrow some things
for the party.

05:39.639 --> 05:42.268
(indistinct crowd chatter)

05:42.409 --> 05:44.343
Richie, Richie, guess what.

05:44.477 --> 05:45.638
- What?
- Guess who asked me out.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.440
- Who?
- David O'Dooley.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.570
Oh.

05:48.715 --> 05:49.876
He's a senior,

05:50.016 --> 05:52.007
and, uh, he's an editor
for the high school paper.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.551
He's such a hunk.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.813
Oh.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.354
Yeah, well,
that's-that's terrific.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.855
He's got a car and everything.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.220
- A car?
- Yeah.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.123
This is going to be a car date?

06:01.261 --> 06:02.387
Well, I don't know.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.928
Dad's not going
to be thrilled about that.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.588
- You know how protective he is.
- Oh.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.292
He's no problem.
<i>l-I'll</i> think of something.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.466
HOWARD:
You what?!

06:12.606 --> 06:14.597
Definitely not!

06:14.741 --> 06:16.141
You are too young to car-date.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.642
But Richie was younger than me
when you let him go.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.644
Tell him, Mom.
Get up and tell him.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.978
Oh... yes, he was younger.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.644
Well, they've
got you there, Dad.

06:27.787 --> 06:28.846
Well, that's different.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.014
I mean, Richard is
a-a-a... a boy.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.955
Oh, what's that got
to do with it?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.151
Yes, dear, she's right.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.887
What has that got to do with it?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.087
- Marion.
- Well...

06:37.230 --> 06:39.028
Get over here.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.158
Didn't you have a talk with her
about that?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.770
Oh, that.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.895
Well, I told her everything.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.336
Everything?

06:47.474 --> 06:49.670
Well, everything
I could remember.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.542
That settles it.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.274
You are absolutely not going.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.282
I will not have
a daughter of mine

06:58.418 --> 07:00.853
-out car-dating
with some... gigolo! -Oh.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.978
Well, Dad, David's not a gigolo.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.147
Uh, he's a senior.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.852
Yes. And Joanie says
he is a hunk.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.428
JOANIE:
Mm-hmm.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.996
A hunk?

07:11.131 --> 07:13.861
Oh, Howard, he sounds
like a very nice boy.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.058
HOWARD:
A hunk?

07:15.201 --> 07:16.828
And I wasn't any older
than Joanie

07:16.970 --> 07:19.405
when you and I used to,
you know, spoon.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.530
You were a hunk.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.635
Well, you two talk this out.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.178
I got to cram for an exam.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.009
This isn't fair.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.345
I mean, you let Richie go,
but you won't let me.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.078
Now, when I was 14,
you said I was too young.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.712
When I was a freshman, you said,
"Wait until next year."

07:36.856 --> 07:40.258
Well, it's next year,
and you still won't let me go.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.589
Dad, don't you trust me?

07:42.729 --> 07:45.255
Of course I trust you.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.866
Okay, you can go.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.093
But I want to meet
this young man first.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.328
Is that fair enough?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.869
- Yeah, you can meet him.
- Okay.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.497
Thanks, Dad. Oh, wait until
Jenny Piccalo hears about this.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.136
<i>No, I don't know
where we're going, Jenny.</i>

07:58.278 --> 08:00.144
I was so excited,
I forgot to ask.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.645
-(doorbell rings)
- Oh, my gosh.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.182
Oh, oh, uh, he's here.
I got to hang up. Bye.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.512
Mom, Mom, he's here.
He's here. He's here.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.279
- Oh, oh, I'm so excited.
- Oh, no. Wait. Here. Here.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.753
- Now, don't... don't act
so excited. -Okay.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.118
Try to be a young lady.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.249
Okay.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.928
Oh, well...

08:22.068 --> 08:23.968
Hello, Chachi.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.130
It's always nice
to see that smile of yours.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.333
Hi, Mrs. C. Here's
the prune pitter you ordered.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.103
The prunes will be here
next week.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.506
Oh, thank you.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.773
Oh, yeah, the holiday season
is coming up.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.440
And this prune pitter
makes the perfect gift.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.610
Oh, I already have a gift
for Howard.

08:40.754 --> 08:46.192
Well... maybe Mother Kelp
could use a couple of these.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.920
Wah, wah, wah.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.591
Thank you. I feel kind of...
wah, wah, wah.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.361
I've got a big date.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.664
Oh, yeah? Who is he?

08:58.805 --> 09:01.467
His name is David O'Dooley.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.236
That wimp?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.368
What does he got
that I haven't got?

09:06.513 --> 09:10.210
Well, he's older, he's taller,
he's a senior, and he has a car.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.408
Besides that.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.485
Come on, Chachi.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.588
I'll give you some milk
and crackers.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.748
I would give you some rye bread,
but Richard forgot it.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.884
(Richie humming)

09:26.699 --> 09:28.964
Party time. (laughs)

09:29.102 --> 09:31.093
Hey. Hi, Joanie.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.671
-(laughter)
- Uh,

09:32.806 --> 09:34.831
well, I-I'm doubling
with Fonz tonight.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.636
He's taking Blossom.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.005
Only one girl?

09:38.144 --> 09:39.510
Must be a slow night.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.978
Hey, that's great.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.514
Drink your milk.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.914
All right, let's get this show
on the road.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.349
Hi, Fonz.

09:47.487 --> 09:52.118
Hey, Joanie, how come
you look so... so tonight, huh?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.454
Well, it's my first real date...

09:54.594 --> 09:56.460
in a car... and everything.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.462
All right, hold it!

09:58.598 --> 10:01.226
Did you say car date?

10:01.367 --> 10:02.767
Are you old enough?

10:02.902 --> 10:04.871
Look, uh, there are some tricks
of the trade

10:05.004 --> 10:06.404
you got to know, see, and, uh,

10:06.539 --> 10:08.269
I'm going to give them to you
right now.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.433
Oh, I already know
all that stuff.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.909
Jenny Piccalo has
an old car seat on the porch.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.037
No, no, no.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.980
(mutters)

10:18.117 --> 10:19.847
Joanie, that is offense.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.819
I'm going to give you defense,
all right?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.719
Now, you drive, I'm Joanie.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.086
I'm your date, all right?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.284
- All right.
- Here we go. -Oh.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.621
Plant yourself, plant yourself.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.491
- I'm driving.
- You're driving. Here we are.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.621
(imitates engine revving)

10:34.334 --> 10:35.631
(imitates tires squealing)

10:35.768 --> 10:37.930
Hold it! Hold it!

10:38.071 --> 10:40.039
We're playing parked here.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.572
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.676
I just... I always get
a little carried away

10:43.810 --> 10:45.300
when I drive
these foreign couches.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.971
(Richie laughs)

10:48.114 --> 10:49.309
(Richie clears throat)

10:49.449 --> 10:51.110
All right, we're on the date,
I'm Joanie.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.310
Here we go. Let's try, uh...

10:53.453 --> 10:56.081
Let's try, "It's, uh...
it's getting very warm in here.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.748
- I got to roll down the window"
routine. -Uh-huh.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.484
I want you to watch every move.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.857
- JOANIE: All right.
- RICHIE: All right.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.854
(Richie clears throat)

11:10.436 --> 11:12.428
(Richie chuckles)

11:14.307 --> 11:16.400
It's really getting
very warm in here.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.704
(in high-pitched voice):
Yeah.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.075
Excuse me.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.706
I have to change the station
on the radio.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.651
(imitating static,
radio stations changing)

11:28.788 --> 11:30.882
(in deep voice):
Hey, this is Wolf man Jack,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.821
telling you not
to touch that girl.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.393
(laughs)

11:34.527 --> 11:36.052
You understand?

11:36.195 --> 11:38.027
That's called changing his tune.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.291
(Richie laughs)

11:39.432 --> 11:40.900
All right.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.297
All right, let's try, uh...

11:42.435 --> 11:44.631
Let's try the old,
um, stretch routine.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.329
- Oh, right. Right.
- Do you know it?

11:46.472 --> 11:49.237
- I always had good luck
with that one. -All right.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.503
Watch every move.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.510
(sighs)
Ah, memories.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.875
Used to call me
Stretch Cunningham.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.643
Yeah, right, just...
stretch, Cunningham.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.082
(yawning)

12:00.219 --> 12:02.518
(inhales deeply)

12:02.655 --> 12:04.715
- Mmm.
-(high-pitched): Ooh!

12:06.659 --> 12:08.650
(high-pitched giggling)

12:10.863 --> 12:12.126
(Richie grunts)

12:13.700 --> 12:15.691
(Richie groans)

12:18.004 --> 12:20.803
Oh, boy, that-that does
bring back memories.

12:20.940 --> 12:24.137
See, but that never stopped
old Stretch Cunningham.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.767
Oh, please, sweetheart.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.971
I was only trying
to give you a kiss.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.742
All right, now, this is
your part, Joanie, all right?

12:30.883 --> 12:32.875
(high-pitched):
Not on a first date!

12:34.287 --> 12:36.483
FONZIE: All right,
you got everything there?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.454
For every action a man's got,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.992
-you got a counteraction,
you dig it? -Why?

12:41.127 --> 12:42.390
BOTH:
What?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.089
Well, I mean,
I've never kissed before.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.325
I'm 15. I want a...

12:48.468 --> 12:49.799
I want a real kiss.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.769
I want to use... both lips.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.268
(car horn blares)

12:58.411 --> 12:59.537
Oh, there he is.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.910
Mom. Mom. Mom, do I look okay?
Do I look okay?

13:03.049 --> 13:05.245
- Hi. I'm David O'Dooley.
- Hello.

13:05.385 --> 13:09.481
Well, I'm Howard Cunningham,
Joanie's father.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.249
This is Joanie's mother.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.915
Incredible. You look so young.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.618
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.422
-(Joanie chuckles)
- Uh, well, actually,

13:16.562 --> 13:20.693
- I am a few years younger
than Mr. Cunningham... -Marion.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.132
I'm, uh, Chachi Arcola.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.500
A very good friend of Joanie's.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.810
Who is on his way home.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.041
Well, good night, everyone.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.914
If you need me,

13:40.053 --> 13:42.647
you know where I'll be.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.085
Well, we better leave, Joanie.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.162
Oh, yeah.
(laughs quietly)

13:51.297 --> 13:52.992
Uh, we're going
to a Hawaiian party.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.123
- Oh.
- Oh.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.528
Hawaiian.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.695
Well, aloha.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.240
Say something
in Hawaiian, Howard.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.366
Be home early.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.111
Well, have a good time.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.010
- Yeah, bye. See you later.
- Thanks. Nice meeting you.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.674
- Bye. Good night.
- And drive carefully, now.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.149
- Yeah, we will.
- We will.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.549
Aw.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.156
Well, there she goes.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.259
Our little girl,
on her very first car date.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.623
- Isn't it nice, Howard?
-(sighs)

14:22.762 --> 14:26.391
I mean, think back to how it was
when you were young.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.523
(car engine starts)

14:31.337 --> 14:33.328
Stop that car!

14:44.751 --> 14:46.878
Ralph, what's going on here?
It's freezing.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.181
A stroke of luck, Rich--
the boiler busted.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.313
There's no heat
for the rest of the night.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.483
Great party, huh?

14:57.430 --> 14:58.920
Why did you open the window?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.794
Rich, it's called ingenuity.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.232
It's too cold for
a "welcome to Hawaii" party,

15:03.369 --> 15:05.667
so I made it
a "welcome Alaska" party.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.797
I seized the moment. You get it?

15:08.941 --> 15:10.170
Yeah, I-l got it.

15:10.309 --> 15:11.538
Your brain is frozen.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.043
Right, right, right.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.910
Take off your coats, everyone.
Make yourself comfortable.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.153
Alaska, Alaska.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.687
Ralph.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.586
Ralph, you're out of control.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.187
Potsie, uh, are you
gonna let him get away

15:31.330 --> 15:32.855
With this Alaska bit?

15:32.999 --> 15:36.162
Want some ice cream?

15:36.302 --> 15:37.997
You guys make great roomies.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.505
You know, the nights
are six months long in Alaska.

15:41.641 --> 15:42.631
(both laugh)

15:42.775 --> 15:45.301
Good thing I slept late
this morning.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.572
Oh, come on, guys,
it's ridiculous.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.409
At least close the icebox.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.141
(laughs)

15:51.284 --> 15:53.946
I'm freezing.
Can I get inside your coat?

15:54.086 --> 15:56.317
Oh, well, I, uh...

15:56.455 --> 15:58.083
Oh.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.249
Alaska is... nice.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.917
(chuckles)

16:03.329 --> 16:06.196
Oh, now I know why
you go to college.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.061
Yeah, so you can freeze.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.964
- It is cold in here.
- Hey, there's Richie.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.400
(door slams)

16:11.537 --> 16:12.732
Huh?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.497
Oh.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.735
Oh, uh...

16:17.877 --> 16:19.208
Oh, <i>I</i> got it.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.904
- I got it. Oh, good.
- What?

16:21.047 --> 16:24.107
You see, we're, uh... we're
playing charades here, uh...

16:24.250 --> 16:25.547
"Embraceable You."

16:25.685 --> 16:26.879
Yeah, oh, that's a good one.

16:27.019 --> 16:27.986
What a great clue.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.521
Yeah. Yeah, see,
we're playing charades.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.317
- Oh.
- Hey, uh, Potsie.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.188
Potsie, come on,
there are little kids here.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.762
Mm.

16:36.896 --> 16:40.059
RICHIE:
Uh... Potsie. Lori Beth.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.361
Lori Beth, what are you doing?
Come on.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.061
I'm trying to keep warm.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.865
Well, what do you think
the light's for?

16:47.006 --> 16:50.465
- Oh, good idea.
- Uh... Uh, Potsie.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.339
Potsie, come on,
let's-let's play. Let's...

16:52.478 --> 16:54.708
Let's do the next charade,
okay? Come on, anything.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.111
All right: lights, lips, action.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.311
Oh.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.820
- Joanie's here.
- Joanie's here.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.922
Fonz, uh, this
is David O'Dooley.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.159
- Hi.
- Hey, hello, car date.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.198
This here is, uh, Blossom.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.771
She just got off work.

17:20.906 --> 17:21.839
She's a bunny.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.738
Outstanding.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.401
RICHIE:
What are we gonna do now, gang?

17:25.544 --> 17:26.671
FONZIE:
All right, let's dance.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.149
You want to dance?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.283
In this cold,
we better keep moving.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.528
(indistinct whisper)

17:52.672 --> 17:53.730
What?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.204
We have to.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.503
We have to set a good example
for the kids. Please. Please.

17:57.643 --> 17:58.770
We're just dancing.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.606
For me.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.646
-(sighs) -Ah. Oh,
that's good, that's good.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.045
(chuckles)

18:04.183 --> 18:05.947
Hmm? Huh?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.678
Huh.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.811
(clears throat)

18:10.623 --> 18:11.715
(whispers):
Fonz.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.018
Not now, Rich.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.060
Got to set an example
for the kid.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.856
Kid.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.396
- Kid.
- Yeah, thanks.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.590
(Snaps fingers)

18:20.733 --> 18:22.724
Kid.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.347
Joanie is ruining the party.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.720
We can't kiss, dance, nose,
snuggle, nothing.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.690
It's just like a regular date.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.820
RICHIE:
All right.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.989
All right, I'll, uh...
I'll talk to her.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.828
POTSIE and RALPH:
Well, talk.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.959
All right, I'm going to.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.398
(clears throat)
Uh, excuse me.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.510
Uh, I need to talk
to Joanie for a second.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.804
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no, sure.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.936
I'll be over at the lightbulb.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.178
What is it now?
Was I dancing too close?

19:11.317 --> 19:12.341
No, no.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.009
Joanie, see,
I'm your brother, and I...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.588
and I have to talk to you.
See, uh...

19:19.191 --> 19:20.784
See, I'm in college now.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.622
Good, Rich,
but I already know that.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.129
What I'm trying to say
is this is a college party.

19:26.265 --> 19:29.064
Now, you two are still
little kids. There's...

19:29.201 --> 19:31.227
Rich, I get it.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.428
You don't want me around.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.130
Hey, that's fine
with me, big brother.

19:34.273 --> 19:37.243
Come on, David, we're leaving.

19:39.311 --> 19:41.746
Oh, yeah, no, uh, I was just
taking my bunny for a walk.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.042
You know, uh...
♪ Da, da, da, de, da, da. ♪

19:44.183 --> 19:46.083
All right, all right,
all right. Look, uh...

19:46.218 --> 19:47.550
Hey, let me ask you a question.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.154
Why you going?

19:49.288 --> 19:52.315
I'm leaving
because of my big brother.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.993
He doesn't want me around
because he thinks I'm a kid.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.893
Well, this is for you.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.022
(blows raspberry)

20:02.168 --> 20:03.499
Did you see what she just did?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.570
Did you see what she
did to me? She went...

20:05.704 --> 20:07.673
(blows raspberry)

20:07.807 --> 20:09.832
Can you believe she did that?
(blows raspberry)

20:09.975 --> 20:11.102
Just like a little kid.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.506
(blows raspberry)

20:12.645 --> 20:13.874
What do you think of that?

20:14.013 --> 20:15.481
(all blow raspberries)

20:20.252 --> 20:22.187
-(car door closes)
- They're here, Marion.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.187
Oh, I knew he'd
bring her back on time.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.484
I wasn't worried.

20:25.624 --> 20:26.785
No?

20:26.926 --> 20:30.453
- Then why are you watering
artificial plants? -Oh.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.828
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:32.965 --> 20:33.932
- Oh, you're back.
- Yeah.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.397
Oh, did you have a nice time?

20:35.534 --> 20:37.093
- Mmm, outstanding.
- Yeah.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.136
How outstanding?

20:39.271 --> 20:40.603
Howard.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.971
Oh. Well, uh, I'm glad
everything worked out.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.579
Well, it's time to say
good night, Joanie.

20:46.712 --> 20:47.736
It's after 11:00.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.644
(short laugh)

20:49.782 --> 20:51.079
I'll be up in a minute, Dad.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.946
Well, why don't you
come on up with us?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.075
Howard.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.051
What? Oh.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.315
Well, okay.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.480
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.388
- Good night. -Good night.
- Good night.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.516
- Good night, dear.
- Yeah, good night.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.787
- It was nice meeting you.
- Good night.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.294
- Oh, nice to have met you, too.
- Thank you. -Good night.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.159
- Good night. -Good night.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.062
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.099
(laughs)

21:09.235 --> 21:10.600
Parents.

21:10.736 --> 21:11.999
Oh, yeah.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.496
You sure are pretty.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.336
I am?

21:18.377 --> 21:19.674
HOWARD:
Joanie!

21:19.812 --> 21:22.508
I'll be right up, Dad.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.810
I think my dad was afraid
that you're, uh,

21:24.950 --> 21:27.317
gonna try and kiss me.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.148
He is?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.188
Uh-huh.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.883
- HOWARD: Joanie!
- Ah! On my way, Dad.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.017
(quick laugh)

21:47.206 --> 21:50.301
I guess your dad was right.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.901
Well, uh, guess I better
take you home now.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.979
L-I think I am home.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.821
(both laugh)

22:03.956 --> 22:04.923
- Yeah.
- I am.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.081
Well, uh...

22:06.225 --> 22:07.385
I guess I better go, then.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.358
Oh, oh, uh, uh, yeah,

22:09.495 --> 22:11.361
(laughing):
I'll open the door.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.488
Yeah. Say, uh...

22:15.568 --> 22:17.297
- HOWARD: Marion!
- Oh.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.461
MARION:
Joanie!

22:19.605 --> 22:20.697
Uh...

22:20.840 --> 22:21.966
Thanks for the evening,
and, uh...

22:22.107 --> 22:23.097
I'll see you at school.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.973
- Okay, bye. (laughs)
- Bye.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.175
He's such a hunk.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.667
Oh, hi, Joanie.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.169
I'm glad you're here.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.171
I've been thinking
about this all the way home.

22:55.307 --> 22:58.004
I'm really sorry about the way
things worked out tonight.

22:58.143 --> 22:59.907
L-I realized something, though.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.809
You're getting older,
and chances are

23:01.947 --> 23:03.244
this is gonna be
happening more often.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.647
You know, uh... us running
into each other socially.

23:06.785 --> 23:09.516
So I think we're gonna be able
to... to just work it out.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.090
But I am sorry that
this happened this way.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.090
Joanie?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.889
Are you listening
to my brother-sister talk?

23:18.163 --> 23:19.222
No.

23:19.365 --> 23:21.265
Oh, well, what's the problem?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.562
He kissed me.

23:23.702 --> 23:26.296
My first real kiss.

23:26.438 --> 23:27.906
It was so romantic.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.031
It left a lump in my throat.

23:31.677 --> 23:34.408
A lump?
That-that sounds serious.

23:34.546 --> 23:37.106
Oh, oh, it was.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.219
I got so excited,
I-l swallowed my gum. (laughs)

23:44.089 --> 23:45.352
Well, listen,
we better get upstairs

23:45.491 --> 23:46.924
before we wake up Mom and Dad.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.925
Oh. Oh, yeah.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.086
Rich, uh...

23:51.230 --> 23:52.925
do you think I'm pretty?

23:53.065 --> 23:55.534
Well, I think so, but,
you know, I'm your brother.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.727
I'm not sure that counts.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.930
I do know that a lot of guys
think you're very pretty.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.508
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.576
- Oh, thanks.
- That's okay.

24:06.712 --> 24:09.340
Joanie...
(clears throat)

24:09.481 --> 24:11.507
Do, uh, girls at Arnold's

24:11.650 --> 24:14.449
think that I'm, uh...

24:14.586 --> 24:16.452
you know...

24:16.588 --> 24:18.147
handsome?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.849
Well, yeah, some of them
think you're handsome.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.118
(Richie chuckles)

24:21.260 --> 24:23.160
But I can't imagine why
with all those freckles.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.729
-(laughs)
.l-ley.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.456
-(shrieks)
- HOWARD: Joanie!

24:26.598 --> 24:27.691
Joanie, what's happening?

24:27.833 --> 24:31.599
You gigolo, what are you
doing to my daughter?

24:40.279 --> 24:41.838
