FLYNN: This doesn't make any sense.

37:54.824 --> 37:57.317
Obviously, I made some sort of mistake

37:57.318 --> 37:59.115
when I brought us back.

37:59.729 --> 38:01.297
Yes, occasionally I can make a mistake.

38:01.298 --> 38:02.750
It doesn't happen very often, though,

38:02.751 --> 38:04.029
but this is not supposed to be here.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.841
This is the exact same totem.

38:05.842 --> 38:08.020
Yes, but Ariel said that
this is only a focus.

38:08.021 --> 38:10.222
There's no actual magic in it.

38:10.223 --> 38:14.031
I rescued you guys. I broke the spell,

38:14.032 --> 38:16.066
brought you back, Ariel's gone.

38:16.067 --> 38:17.758
We can't get in the Library.

38:17.759 --> 38:20.592
- Where is Jenkins, anyway?
- Who's Jenkins?

38:20.593 --> 38:23.028
- What'd you say?
- I said this is weird,

38:23.029 --> 38:24.563
and it is weird, because
I broke the spell.

38:24.564 --> 38:25.940
This should not be here.

38:25.941 --> 38:27.886
Jenkins. Flynn, Jenkins.

38:27.887 --> 38:29.888
Tall guy, bow tie, walks like this.

38:29.889 --> 38:31.656
Semi-mortal. Likes to tidy up.

38:31.657 --> 38:34.292
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

38:34.293 --> 38:37.629
Oh. This is the spell
trying to reassert itself.

38:37.630 --> 38:39.764
I'm thinking it hasn't
stopped asserting itself.

38:39.765 --> 38:41.466
Flynn, <i>you're</i> under Prospero's spell.

38:41.467 --> 38:44.869
No, no. No, I rescued <i>you from Prospero.</i>

38:44.870 --> 38:47.505
You... I did it single-handedly.

38:47.506 --> 38:49.165
You saved us by yourself,

38:49.189 --> 38:50.274
- with no-one's help...
- Yes.

38:50.275 --> 38:52.077
You don't remember Jenkins.
The totem's here.

38:52.078 --> 38:53.578
We can't get into the Library.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.687
No, no, no. I saved you.
I agree Prospero's

38:55.688 --> 38:56.548
trying to reassert his magic,

38:56.549 --> 38:58.279
but it has nothing to do
with me. It has to do with you.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.723
It always had something to do with you.

38:59.724 --> 39:02.963
I just can't figure out how
this is supposed to get you

39:02.964 --> 39:04.598
- back on that island.
- Exactly.

39:04.599 --> 39:07.801
You're trying to figure it out.
That's the whole point.

39:07.802 --> 39:09.302
- You love puzzles.
- Yes.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.405
And this one's huge... the biggest one.

39:11.406 --> 39:13.164
That is crazy. Eve, are you...

39:13.165 --> 39:14.864
Flynn, your happily-ever-after

39:14.865 --> 39:17.269
is an endless series of
puzzles and mysteries

39:17.270 --> 39:18.503
that you get to solve.

39:18.504 --> 39:20.605
Yeah, but I wasn't even here
when all this started.

39:20.606 --> 39:22.774
This is Prospero.

39:22.775 --> 39:24.609
This is all some sort of hallucination.

39:24.610 --> 39:27.512
You guys are all... maybe even
possessed by some sort...

39:27.513 --> 39:32.216
<i>[Whooshing]</i>

39:34.853 --> 39:37.823
[Inhales deeply, flaps lips]

39:37.824 --> 39:41.760
- Eve?
- There you are.

39:41.761 --> 39:45.861
Ooh. [Exhales deeply]
I'm under the spell, aren't I?

39:45.862 --> 39:47.136
Yes, you are.

39:47.530 --> 39:49.231
But I don't have a talisman.

39:49.232 --> 39:52.166
[Clears throat]

39:55.804 --> 39:57.806
[Click]

39:57.807 --> 40:00.943
<i>[Soft whoosh]</i>

40:00.944 --> 40:03.879
You know what to do.

40:03.880 --> 40:07.548
Yeah, I think I do.

40:12.721 --> 40:16.758
[Clears throat] Um... hi.

40:16.759 --> 40:18.260
I'm Flynn Carsen.

40:18.261 --> 40:20.361
I'm the...

40:21.330 --> 40:25.701
I'm Flynn Carsen, and I'm <i>a</i> Librarian.

40:25.702 --> 40:27.469
Number 167, I think.

40:27.470 --> 40:29.738
I was alone for a very long time,

40:29.739 --> 40:31.206
and then I got a golden letter

40:31.207 --> 40:36.378
that showed me that there was
an entirely different world...

40:36.379 --> 40:37.946
magic. [Chuckles]

40:37.947 --> 40:42.651
And I thought that's all I needed.

40:42.652 --> 40:44.086
But, um...

40:44.087 --> 40:49.356
Now... I know that I need more.

40:50.425 --> 40:53.661
<i>[Whooshing]</i>

40:57.266 --> 41:00.035
That was, uh...
not as easy as it looked.

41:00.036 --> 41:03.171
We could, uh, totally just...
Oh. Totem's gone.

41:03.172 --> 41:05.407
So that's... finally it. It's over?

41:05.408 --> 41:08.043
- Only one way to find out.
- [Door opens]

41:08.044 --> 41:09.278
Jenkins!

41:09.279 --> 41:12.414
Oh. Three weeks.

41:12.415 --> 41:14.783
All of us under a spell.
So glad you're back.

41:14.784 --> 41:17.786
Prospero had us under for three weeks.

41:17.787 --> 41:19.621
What's Prospero been
doing for three weeks?

41:19.622 --> 41:21.390
Flynn, look up.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.025
- [Whooshing]
- The ley lines.

41:23.026 --> 41:24.226
Why are they up there?

41:24.227 --> 41:26.395
The paths of magic...
they're supercharged.

41:26.396 --> 41:27.729
Is that good or bad?

41:27.730 --> 41:31.166
Depends on how you feel
about the end of the world.
