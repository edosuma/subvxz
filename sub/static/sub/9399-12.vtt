<i>(MYHOMETOWN</i> PLAYING)

00:17.217 --> 00:20.880
<i>LUKE: When I was a boy,</i>
<i>my family took me on a trip.</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:26.118
<i>We didn't go to any exotic place,</i>
<i>we didn't go anywhere glamorous,</i>

00:26.292 --> 00:27.782
<i>we just drove.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:31.057
<i>JAMIE: Where did you go, Uncle Lucas?</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:36.632
<i>We drove the back roads of Tree Hill,</i>
<i>and we saw all kinds of wonderful things.</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:41.229
<i>- But where were you going?</i>
<i>- Everywhere. Anywhere.</i>

00:41.941 --> 00:44.876
<i>But where we ended up</i>
<i>really wasn't the point.</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:48.309
<i>It was the things we saw,</i>
<i>and the people we met along the way.</i>

00:48.381 --> 00:50.008
<i>Who was with you?</i>

00:50.183 --> 00:52.743
<i>It was just my mom, my uncle and me.</i>

00:54.187 --> 00:57.953
<i>- Where was your daddy?</i>
<i>- He wasn't there.</i>

01:02.829 --> 01:06.094
<i>But something happened that day,</i>
<i>something magical.</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:08.693
<i>What was it? What happened?</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:12.671
<i>My uncle let me drive.</i>

01:15.108 --> 01:18.009
<i>- Were you scared?</i>
<i>- No. I mean,</i>

01:18.845 --> 01:21.780
<i>the truth is I'm not sure I ever felt safer.</i>

01:23.216 --> 01:26.777
<i>That day in that car</i>
<i>with my uncle and my mom</i>

01:28.721 --> 01:31.212
<i>is one of the best days of my life,</i>

01:32.792 --> 01:34.419
<i>just like today.</i>

02:16.569 --> 02:18.093
(CAR HONKING)

02:41.027 --> 02:45.191
Wow. That's gonna make
for one beautiful bride.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.803
Hi. I wanna come home, Haley. I love you.

03:00.246 --> 03:03.044
I have to get ready right now. I can't...

03:08.821 --> 03:10.152
(HALEY SIGHING)

03:11.691 --> 03:14.683
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I wanted to.

03:17.764 --> 03:18.890
Yeah.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.948
So, you wanna talk about this?

04:09.549 --> 04:11.380
Well, you hate my book
and you think I picked the wrong girl

04:11.451 --> 04:13.316
to spend the rest of my life with.
What's there to talk about?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.013
Stop it, you know that I love Lindsey.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.817
Oh, but I don't? I mean, I think I do.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.591
But I guess I'm just lying to myself.
Is that your story?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.924
Geez, see if I read anything
you write ever again.

04:22.996 --> 04:27.126
Look, Hales, you can't say that the
manuscript I gave you was about Peyton.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.533
It's about yearning and want, Luke.

04:32.338 --> 04:36.138
I think you wrote it about Peyton
because you still love her.

04:36.242 --> 04:39.234
And I think it's about
a guy watching the sky.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.644
But thanks for caring.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.816
Well, whatever you do,
just don't show those pages to Lindsey.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.375
I already did.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.645
- Mom!
- And?

04:50.657 --> 04:51.646
- Lucas?
- Mom.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.454
Oh, my gosh. Oh, I missed you, baby boy.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.221
Oh, I missed you, too.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.457
- Oh, Haley.
- Hi.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.431
- How are you?
- I'm good.

05:00.733 --> 05:04.533
- Oh, and who is this?
- It's me, Aunt Karen. James Lucas Scott.

05:04.604 --> 05:08.165
No, you are not James Lucas Scott.
Jamie Scott is a baby.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.175
- I got bigger.
- You got bigger.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.473
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

05:13.613 --> 05:17.071
- Where's Lily?
- Yeah, Ma, where's my little sister?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.808
Your little sister's with Andy.

05:38.638 --> 05:42.506
I think it's really great that you
and my mom are back together, Andy.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.042
Thanks, Luke.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.506
I think it's really great
that you're almost gonna get married.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.378
Well, I mean, until your fiancée meets me.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.513
I gotta talk to my mom
about getting rid of you.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.553
Listen,

06:02.161 --> 06:06.325
I love your mom and Lily,
but I want you to know something.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.834
I'd give it all up if Keith could be here
on your wedding day,

06:12.905 --> 06:15.032
and all the days after that.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.441
Thank you.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.653
(WHISTLING <i>BRIDAL MARCH)</i>

06:44.337 --> 06:46.100
I do love a wedding.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.541
Perfect occasion for a family reunion.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.817
(WHISTLING A GRIM TUNE)

07:11.764 --> 07:13.823
LUKE: All right, dude. Sit still.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.926
You wanna be the second-best looking guy
in this church, don't you?

07:17.003 --> 07:18.732
- Second-best?
- Daddy!

07:19.071 --> 07:22.837
Hey. Jamie's gonna be the man.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.706
I'm gonna be second-best.
You'll be lucky to make the top ten, Luke.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.246
- Thanks.
- Oh, come here.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.041
I love you, boy.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.678
How much have you grown
in the last week? A foot?

07:32.752 --> 07:35.312
Maybe. Aunt Karen didn't even know me.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.016
Wow. All right.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.883
Oh, and, Daddy, did you see Mama?
She looked pretty.

07:43.596 --> 07:46.690
I'll bet. Well, you know the drill, right?

07:47.033 --> 07:50.628
You're gonna lead Lindsey down the aisle
with Lily and then when you get to me,

07:50.703 --> 07:53.263
- you're gonna give me these two rings.
- Whoa.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.106
- Treasure.
- Nice, huh?

07:56.175 --> 07:58.109
And worth, like,
all the money in the world,

07:58.177 --> 08:01.078
so when I give them to you,
don't lose 'em, okay?

08:01.147 --> 08:04.014
'Cause Uncle Lucas can't finish
his second book and he's poor.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.610
- I'm sorry you're poor, Uncle Lucas.
- Thanks, Jamie.

08:10.723 --> 08:14.523
Hey, Daddy, when you married Mama,
was it your best day ever?

08:14.627 --> 08:18.654
Actually, I think the day I graduated
high school was my best day ever.

08:18.731 --> 08:19.789
How come?

08:19.866 --> 08:22.733
Well, because that's the day
you were born.

08:23.402 --> 08:25.529
Now lace 'em up. Chop, chop.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.604
- Got any intel for me with my girl?
- Not really.

08:31.911 --> 08:35.244
She misses you, she's still stubborn,
same as last week.

08:35.313 --> 08:38.215
But I tell you, it kind of sucks for you
that my mom's here.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.219
- Why's that?
- Well, she raised a son

08:41.287 --> 08:44.017
with a really great uncle and no husband.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.955
Dan sucks.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.617
(DOOR OPENING)

08:47.693 --> 08:51.925
Flowers for the bride,
who's clearly not here. Sorry.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.823
- I'll take them.
- I'll take them.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.425
Dude, you gotta give me this one.
If I take these flowers to Lindsey,

08:56.502 --> 08:58.470
- I get some face time with Haley.
- Forget it, man.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.506
Lindsey's been staying with Haley
to make it all romantic.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.905
- I haven't seen her in a week.
- So? It's bad luck.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.671
Besides, what do you think is gonna go
down before your wedding in a church?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.645
Oh, you underestimate me.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.774
You're going to hell. Listen.
You and Lindsey are good, okay?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.478
You're still in that blissed-out,
best-underwear,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.316
she-still-laughs-at-your-stupid-jokes
phase.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.821
- My jokes aren't stupid.
- That's what you think.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.825
Look, the point is, I need this, okay?
I'm fading fast here.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.160
HALEY: Oh, flowers from a gentleman.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.197
- LUKE: Hey, we can help you out with that.
- Hey, look who it is.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.856
Sorry, bad luck.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.128
<i>(JANE, I STILL FEEL THE</i> SAMEPLAYING)

09:30.002 --> 09:33.438
"Hey, look who it is"?
No wonder you're fading.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.337
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

09:37.410 --> 09:41.176
Hey, Lily. Oh, I sure did miss you.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.045
You think you could let your big brother
Lucas in and come say hello?

09:44.116 --> 09:45.879
No, you're bad luck.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.318
How did I get so lucky?

09:53.459 --> 09:56.087
You know, if I knew being engaged
would be like this,

09:56.162 --> 09:59.256
- I'd have proposed when we met.
- (WHISPERING) It's the book.

10:00.499 --> 10:04.765
- The book? My book?
- I love it, Lucas.

10:04.971 --> 10:08.168
I love what you wrote,
and I love that you wrote it.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.037
It's so romantic.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.169
Okay, we can definitely talk
about this later.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.180
You know, can I ask you,

10:27.126 --> 10:30.960
- how do you mean, "romantic"?
- What?

10:31.163 --> 10:33.961
Well, I'm glad you like it and all, but

10:34.934 --> 10:37.368
I didn't really expect "romantic."

10:37.603 --> 10:40.003
I mean, it's about a scientist and the stars.

10:40.072 --> 10:44.532
Luke, are you kidding me?
I cried so much.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.908
He's just this lost little boy
and then he sees the comet,

10:47.980 --> 10:50.039
and suddenly his life has meaning,

10:50.116 --> 10:52.209
and then he waits his whole life
for the comet to return.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.344
He has faith that it will,
even though science and his intellect

10:55.421 --> 10:58.720
tells him it won't. His heart still believes.

11:05.097 --> 11:08.828
It's beautiful, Lucas, and heartbreaking.

11:09.735 --> 11:13.432
- It's an epic love story.
- It's about a comet.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.405
It's about love in its purest form.

11:17.810 --> 11:22.076
When I think about how it came
from your heart and your mind,

11:22.481 --> 11:25.245
it makes me so happy to know
that I found you

11:26.485 --> 11:28.953
and that I get to be your wife.

11:31.323 --> 11:35.191
Thank you. I love you, Lindsey.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.989
I love you, Lucas.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.540
I'm sorry, we're closed.

11:52.311 --> 11:56.008
Oh, my God. Do you hate me?

11:56.282 --> 11:58.546
No, I am proud of you.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.880
- I missed you. How's Lily?
- Oh, she's good.

12:02.955 --> 12:05.549
She's very girly.
But you'll see her at the wedding.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.819
Yeah, God,
unless I'm so late that I miss it.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.383
I'm supposed to be there.
You're supposed to be there.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.487
No, I know.
I just wanted to come by and see the café

12:11.564 --> 12:14.192
and to see you and maybe catch Peyton.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.802
- She's on her way.
- Good.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.639
- How's she doing?
- She's a mess.

12:21.974 --> 12:25.137
She's trying to put on a brave face
and be noble,

12:25.745 --> 12:28.009
but we all thought
this was gonna be her day.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.172
Yeah.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.943
And how are you? Are you happy?
You are doing so well.

12:34.019 --> 12:37.216
Thank you. It's hard, but I'm happy.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.815
At least I'm trying to be.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.820
Can I ask you something?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.959
(SHINEPLAYING)

12:52.471 --> 12:54.735
I made Lindsey's wedding gown,

12:54.807 --> 12:57.833
and it got me to thinking about
how I was supposed to make yours.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.070
- It's okay.
- It's not okay,

13:00.146 --> 13:02.671
and somehow you managed
to make it okay.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.714
And I just wonder, I mean,

13:05.785 --> 13:09.118
'cause I've always wondered
where that strength comes from,

13:09.255 --> 13:13.214
that dignity and grace
that you have put on

13:13.292 --> 13:16.853
in the face of everything
that's happened in your life.

13:17.897 --> 13:21.333
Because I really wanna be
that kind of person someday.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.164
You already are, Brooke Davis.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.833
You've come further than anyone I know.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.941
And you want to know a secret?
You have just scratched the surface.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.015
Thank you.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.279
(DOOR OPENING)

13:41.921 --> 13:44.446
Hey, Brooke, come on. We're gonna be...

13:45.257 --> 13:47.418
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.923
- Thank you for my office.
- Oh, you are so welcome.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.428
I know we have to go,
but there really is something

13:53.499 --> 13:55.933
I wanted to tell you, both of you.

13:56.001 --> 14:00.370
You know, in life, if you let it, you can
always come up with reasons to give up.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.430
But if you don't,

14:03.209 --> 14:06.406
you might just find love
in places you never imagined.

14:06.612 --> 14:10.548
- In a new relationship or in your work.
- Or in your children.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.085
Whatever it is, just don't give up on it.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.321
And if you don't get it, well,

14:21.727 --> 14:24.059
you might get something better.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.931
That's what you have to call me.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.733
- I do not.
- Do so. Say it.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.703
Aunt Lily.

14:39.511 --> 14:43.379
Whoa, you look like Cinderella.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.423
I cannot believe we don't
have dates for this thing.

14:54.493 --> 14:58.054
What kind of boyfriend takes his guy
roommate camping for the weekend?

14:58.297 --> 14:59.958
Jake Gyllenhaal?

15:00.032 --> 15:02.592
- That's nice.
- What up, what up? Who want a beer?

15:03.035 --> 15:04.161
I do.

15:04.270 --> 15:08.172
- You're tailgating at Luke's wedding.
- Like you don't want one.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.003
I'm designated driver.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.843
So, what up, P. Sawyer?
You got a plan?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.610
- A plan for what?
- To steal Lucas back.

15:19.618 --> 15:23.076
Oh, so I'm the only one thinking like that,
huh? Okay, look.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.619
Here's the drill.

15:24.690 --> 15:28.592
When they say, "Does anybody have any
reason that this thing shouldn't go down?"

15:28.661 --> 15:30.253
Bam, that's you.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.722
They don't do that at real weddings, Skills.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.961
They should, though.
You know, that's good drama.

15:36.168 --> 15:40.764
Anyway, how about this? I say we drug
Lindsey first, even though I love her.

15:41.173 --> 15:45.234
Then we throw you in the wedding gown,
so when Lucas lift up the veil, bam, it's on.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.575
Skills? That gown is tailor-made, so no.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.606
And Peyton is gonna be okay.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.881
Right. You know I love you,
P. Sawyer, right?

15:55.587 --> 16:00.615
But, baby girl, you are so far from okay,
man, you ain't even in the same area code.

16:01.427 --> 16:04.828
Wait. Maybe Lucas will say
the wrong name on the altar,

16:04.897 --> 16:06.922
just like Ross did on <i>Friends.</i>

16:06.999 --> 16:10.093
Okay. How about this?
How about Peyton puts on a nice dress,

16:10.269 --> 16:13.796
watches Lucas get married, gets wasted,
and has drunk, meaningless sex

16:13.872 --> 16:16.466
- with some guy at the reception?
- Yes.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.040
Hey, baby, I ever tell you
how sexy you look in that dress?

16:19.111 --> 16:20.738
(ALL LAUGHING)

16:21.613 --> 16:23.581
Maybe we should head in.

16:24.883 --> 16:28.444
- Hey, aren't you watching Jamie?
- You know what? You right.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.652
We got to get one for him, too.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.453
Let's do it. See y'all inside.

16:36.762 --> 16:40.220
I meant what I said.
You're gonna be okay.

16:40.332 --> 16:44.428
No, I know. I know. I just...
I just need a minute, you know?

16:45.604 --> 16:46.696
Okay.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.708
I'll save you a seat.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.844
- Can I help you?
- Hello, Haley.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.677
Save it. You're not going into that church.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.914
And you're not gonna talk to my son, my
husband, Karen, or Lucas, for that matter.

17:35.988 --> 17:39.947
You should be careful about being so
bossy. I've been in prison a long time.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.017
- Kind of sexy.
- Don't screw with me, Dan.

17:43.095 --> 17:46.087
This is the last conversation
you and I will ever have.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.963
Enjoy your reprehensible, miserable life.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.744

18:06.085 --> 18:08.212
Yeah. I'm ready.

18:09.488 --> 18:13.424
Well, I'm not much for speeches,
but you're a good guy, Luke.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.918
You're a good friend.
You're a great brother.

18:16.995 --> 18:20.522
Whatever life throws at you,
I got your back, all right?

Like, "This isn't how
I pictured my wedding night"?

19:16.989 --> 19:21.153
No. Like, this is the night
we're gonna tell our children about,

19:21.226 --> 19:23.353

19:24.196 --> 19:26.391
Yeah, I'd like to have kids someday.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.365
A son with your eyes?

No. A little girl, just like you.

It's a lot to process, I know.

I mean, are you sure?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.598
I'm sure.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.362
- Do you...
- PEYTON: Lucas, you can't.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.338
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- PEYTON: I'm sorry.

22:56.441 --> 23:00.241
I'm sorry, but you just...
You can't, because I love you,

23:00.579 --> 23:03.207
- and because you fixed my car.
- (SIGHING) Oh, boy.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.511
But remember that day?
Because that day changed everything,

23:05.584 --> 23:07.176
and I just... I didn't know it at the time.

23:07.252 --> 23:10.244
But when you fixed my car,
you fixed my heart.

23:10.455 --> 23:14.084
And when you proposed to me
two years ago, I just wasn't ready.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.787
And I was lost and scared,
so I said "someday,"

23:16.862 --> 23:19.057
but someday is now, Luke, it is.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.929
Someday is now, and I love you.

23:22.834 --> 23:26.497
Please don't leave me again.
People always leave.

Hi. Oh, God, I missed you so much.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.968
What are you doing here, Nanny Carrie?

24:34.039 --> 24:36.507
Your mom and dad said
I could be with you again.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.442
Oh, I get you back, and I'm so happy.

24:40.245 --> 24:43.373
- Come on.
- I'm not supposed to leave the church.

24:44.282 --> 24:46.682
Jamie, you know I love you.

Don't you trust me?

- Excuse me?

25:09.674 --> 25:11.471
It was a comet, Luke.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.940
Could you just give us a moment, please?

25:18.750 --> 25:21.913
- The boy saw a comet.
- Okay.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.619
The boy saw the comet,
and he felt as though his life had meaning.

25:26.691 --> 25:31.321
And when it went away, he waited his
entire life for it to come back to him.

25:32.330 --> 25:35.993
Lindsey, I love you, but this really isn't
the time for a book review, okay?

you ever talked to Peyton?

- Lindsey...
- Please.

then just go get her, man.

Well, that was a crazy wedding, huh?

who got everything she ever wanted?

29:48.586 --> 29:50.451
Did she feel horrible?

29:51.022 --> 29:55.220
At first. But it's only
'cause she had a good heart.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.155
And then she fixed her makeup
and smoothed out her pretty dress

29:59.230 --> 30:03.360
- and went and talked to the boy she loves.
- He said "I do," Brooke.

and cherish Lindsey forever,

"I do" today to Lindsey

34:04.942 --> 34:07.172
And I'll bring you a present.

34:07.845 --> 34:11.042
- When are we going home?
- Home? What...

34:12.717 --> 34:15.514
- Don't you wanna play a game?
- I guess so.

34:16.219 --> 34:19.587
Okay. Let's play Hide and Seek.

34:19.857 --> 34:23.884
I want you to hide, and don't come out
until I find you, okay?

34:29.132 --> 34:32.226
Okay, I'll go out, and you hide.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.734
Go on.

35:08.506 --> 35:10.940
The police are looking everywhere.

35:12.510 --> 35:16.207
Dan's license-plate number is
on every single highway sign.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.083
Haley, you should...
You should come downstairs.

35:22.153 --> 35:23.780
I don't want to.

35:23.921 --> 35:25.946
- Haley...
- I don't want to.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.795
- You should've been there.
- I know.

35:33.397 --> 35:37.094
You're his father.
You should've been there to protect him.

35:38.269 --> 35:41.170
You should've been there,
and I should've let you come home.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.503
- This is not your fault, Haley.
- Yes, it is!

35:44.175 --> 35:45.836
Haley, come here.

35:50.982 --> 35:54.179
- I can't lose him! He's all I have.
- I know.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.348
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.161
Jamie.

36:12.637 --> 36:14.537
Jamie, can you hear me?

36:21.045 --> 36:23.980
Listen to me. I'm here to help you.

36:25.950 --> 36:29.818
You have to open the door, son.
I'm here to take you home.

36:36.894 --> 36:40.227
Lindsey! Lindsey!

36:41.399 --> 36:42.593
Linds?

36:45.403 --> 36:46.392
Hi.

36:46.671 --> 36:50.767
"It was more than just a comet
because of what it brought to his life.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.138
"Direction, beauty and meaning.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.976
"There were many
who couldn't understand,

36:56.047 --> 36:58.538
"and sometimes he walked among them.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.946
"But even in his darkest hours,

37:01.319 --> 37:04.982
"he knew in his heart that someday,
it would return to him,

37:05.456 --> 37:07.686
"and his world would be whole again,

37:07.758 --> 37:12.786
"and his belief in God and love and art
would be reawakened in his heart."

37:13.564 --> 37:15.862
<i>(APOLOGIES</i> PLAYING)

37:15.933 --> 37:19.926
Lindsey, it's just a story.
I mean, so what?

37:21.272 --> 37:23.900
Peyton's car is just a Comet, you know?

37:25.676 --> 37:28.611
But this is crazy. I love you.

37:29.447 --> 37:33.816
I love you, too, Lucas.
I do, and I always will.

37:37.822 --> 37:42.225
But your heart's conflicted,
and I think I've always known it.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.162
I guess I was hoping that someday

37:47.732 --> 37:49.597
I could be your comet.

37:57.408 --> 37:59.706
It's an epic love story, Luke.

38:00.611 --> 38:02.374
It's just not ours.

38:04.348 --> 38:06.145
And neither is this.

38:10.488 --> 38:14.015
Lindsey, please. You can't just leave.

38:17.361 --> 38:21.354
People always leave, Luke.
You know that.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.443
Jamie?

38:38.382 --> 38:41.715
I'm back. I'm gonna find you.

38:42.920 --> 38:46.720
I'm gonna get you. Jamie.

38:50.361 --> 38:53.489
I think you're wrong.
I think I'm gonna get you.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.462
My name is Dan Scott.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.966
I think you know my grandson.

38:59.403 --> 39:02.304
It's okay. You can blink once for yes.

39:05.076 --> 39:09.672
That's what I thought. Well, you're done
knowing him for the rest of time.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.376
And if you forget,

39:12.450 --> 39:16.079
or if you decide to go anywhere
near my family ever again,

39:17.121 --> 39:20.613
let's just say this.
I killed my brother in cold blood.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.857
I'd have no problem killing you.

39:39.477 --> 39:43.573
Man, I would never forgive myself.
He has to come home. He has to.

39:49.453 --> 39:51.853
Is it okay if I play with this?

39:53.491 --> 39:54.515
Yeah.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.730
Haley.

40:10.207 --> 40:12.971
I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.974
You've got to believe that, okay?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.578
He's gonna come home.

40:30.394 --> 40:31.554
Mama!

40:32.563 --> 40:34.997
Oh, baby, come here.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.741
Sweetie, what happened to you?
Are you okay?

40:44.909 --> 40:47.503
I'm fine. Grandpa Dan saved me.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.373
What?
