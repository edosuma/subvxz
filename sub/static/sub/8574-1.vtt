02:15.084 --> 02:16.833
When shall we three meet again?

02:17.917 --> 02:20.708
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

02:21.500 --> 02:23.374
When the hurly-burly's done.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.583
When the battle's lost and won.

02:26.292 --> 02:27.458
Where the place?

02:27.584 --> 02:31.124
Upon the battlefield,
there to meet with Macbeth.

02:32.125 --> 02:35.249
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.499
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

07:15.584 --> 07:19.958
Doubtful it stood, as two spent
swimmers that do cling together

07:20.084 --> 07:21.416
and choke their art.

07:22.667 --> 07:25.208
'The merciless Macdonwald
from the Western Isles

07:25.334 --> 07:28.166
'of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied.'

07:28.875 --> 07:32.874
And fortune,
on his damned quarrel smiling,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.999
showed like a rebel's whore.

07:35.959 --> 07:39.291
But all's too weak, for brave Macbeth...

07:39.792 --> 07:41.791
well he deserves that name...

07:41.917 --> 07:45.958
disdaining fortune,
with his brandished steel

07:46.084 --> 07:49.833
which smoked with bloody execution,

07:49.959 --> 07:51.374
like valour's minion

07:51.500 --> 07:54.583
carved out his passage
till he faced the slave

07:54.709 --> 07:57.458
which ne'er shook hands

07:57.584 --> 07:59.749
nor bade farewell to him

07:59.875 --> 08:02.666
till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops

08:02.792 --> 08:06.833
and fixed his head upon our battlements.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.666
And, to conclude,

08:13.792 --> 08:15.999
victory fell on us.

08:18.459 --> 08:20.624
Valiant Macbeth.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.874
Worthy gentleman.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.624
Great happiness.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.291
Whence cam'st thou, noble Prince?

08:40.375 --> 08:43.166
From Fife, great King,

08:43.292 --> 08:47.666
where Norwegian banners flout the sky
and fan our people cold,

08:47.792 --> 08:51.416
assisted by that most disloyal traitor,

08:51.542 --> 08:53.416
the Thane of Cawdor.

09:01.084 --> 09:02.624
God save the King!

09:12.667 --> 09:18.749
No more that Thane of Cawdor
shall deceive our bosom interest.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.624
Go pronounce his present death

09:24.792 --> 09:27.333
and with his former title greet Macbeth.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.458
I'll see it done.

09:31.625 --> 09:36.041
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.749
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

10:52.459 --> 10:54.083
What are these?

10:56.042 --> 10:58.499
Live you or are you aught
that man may question?

11:03.500 --> 11:05.708
Speak, if you can. What are you?

11:29.250 --> 11:32.833
Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.791
Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.

11:38.042 --> 11:40.583
All hail, Macbeth,
that shalt be king hereafter.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.291
Good sir,

11:46.334 --> 11:49.499
why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.708
My noble partner
you greet with present grace

11:52.834 --> 11:55.916
and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope

11:56.042 --> 11:57.583
that he seems rapt withal.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.124
To me you speak not.

11:59.875 --> 12:03.916
Hail, lesser than Macbeth and greater.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.874
Not so happy yet much happier.

12:07.584 --> 12:10.749
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.999
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

12:16.584 --> 12:18.499
'Banquo and Macbeth,

12:18.625 --> 12:19.958
'all hail.'

12:36.084 --> 12:40.333
Stay, you imperfect speakers.
Tell me more.

12:40.459 --> 12:43.791
Say from whence you owe
this strange intelligence

12:43.917 --> 12:45.583
and why, upon this blasted heath,

12:45.709 --> 12:48.208
you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.833
Speak, I charge you.

13:01.625 --> 13:05.041
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
and these are of them.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.999
Whither are they vanished?

13:08.209 --> 13:10.249
Into the air,

13:10.375 --> 13:13.374
and what seemed corporal
melted as breath into the wind.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.916
Would they had stayed.

13:18.584 --> 13:20.999
Were such things here
as we do speak about?

13:22.042 --> 13:25.124
Or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.458
Your children shall be kings.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.999
You shall be king.

13:37.084 --> 13:40.666
And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?

13:40.792 --> 13:42.833
To the selfsame tune and words.

14:01.584 --> 14:03.708
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,

14:03.834 --> 14:05.874
the news of thy success.

14:11.250 --> 14:14.124
As thick as hail came post from post

14:14.250 --> 14:17.458
and every one did bear thy praises,
in his kingdom's great defence,

14:17.584 --> 14:19.083
and poured them down before him.

14:20.042 --> 14:22.958
And we are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks.

14:25.167 --> 14:27.708
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,

14:27.834 --> 14:31.041
he bade me from him
call thee Thane of Cawdor.

14:33.875 --> 14:36.708
The Thane of Cawdor lives.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.083
Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?

14:39.209 --> 14:42.208
Treasons capital, confessed and proved,
have overthrown him.

15:04.167 --> 15:06.749
Do you not hope
your children shall be kings

15:08.917 --> 15:11.166
when those that gave
the Thane of Cawdor to me

15:11.292 --> 15:13.166
promised no less to them?

15:15.667 --> 15:18.499
That trusted home might yet
enkindle you unto the crown

15:18.625 --> 15:20.624
besides the Thane of Cawdor.

15:23.292 --> 15:25.124
But 'tis strange,

15:26.834 --> 15:28.708
and oftentimes, to win us to our harm,

15:29.750 --> 15:33.291
the instruments of darkness
tell us truths,

15:33.417 --> 15:35.416
win us with honest trifles

15:35.542 --> 15:38.083
to betray's in deepest consequence.

15:46.500 --> 15:50.708
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill,

15:50.834 --> 15:53.124
cannot be good.

15:56.084 --> 15:59.458
If ill, why hath it given me
earnest of success,

15:59.584 --> 16:01.541
commencing in a truth?

16:03.042 --> 16:04.833
I am Thane of Cawdor.

16:10.375 --> 16:13.249
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion

16:13.375 --> 16:15.499
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair

16:15.625 --> 16:17.583
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs

16:17.709 --> 16:19.333
against the use of nature?

16:22.125 --> 16:24.999
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.416
If chance will have me king,

16:30.750 --> 16:33.458
why, chance may crown me without my stir.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.540
Hail, Macbeth.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.665
O worthiest cousin.

17:28.625 --> 17:32.041
More is thy due
than more than all can pay.

17:33.917 --> 17:37.958
The service and the loyalty I owe
in doing it pays itself.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.624
From hence to Inverness,
and bind us further to you.

17:46.292 --> 17:47.833
I'll be myself the harbinger

17:47.959 --> 17:50.916
and make joyful the hearing of my wife
with your approach,

17:52.667 --> 17:54.083
so humbly take my leave.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.374
My worthy Cawdor.

18:52.917 --> 18:55.624
"They met me in the day of success

18:55.750 --> 18:59.041
"and I have learned
by the perfect'st report

18:59.167 --> 19:02.374
"they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.874
"When I burned in desire
to question them further,

19:08.375 --> 19:11.708
"they made themselves air
into which they vanished.

19:13.792 --> 19:17.083
"Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it
came missives from the King

19:18.042 --> 19:20.749
"who all-hailed me

19:20.875 --> 19:22.833
"Thane of Cawdor,

19:24.042 --> 19:28.083
"by which title before
these Weird Sisters saluted me

19:28.209 --> 19:31.333
"and referred me
to the coming on of time with,

19:33.959 --> 19:35.999
"'Hail, king that shalt be."'

19:41.750 --> 19:43.124
Come,

19:44.250 --> 19:47.458
you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts,

19:49.292 --> 19:50.833
unsex me here

19:52.125 --> 19:56.624
and fill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.

19:58.459 --> 20:02.333
Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall,

20:02.459 --> 20:04.374
you murthering ministers,

20:05.125 --> 20:09.416
wherever, in your sightless substances,
you wait on nature's mischief.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.499
Come, thick night,

20:16.125 --> 20:19.249
and pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell,

20:19.375 --> 20:22.833
that my keen knife see not
the wound it makes,

20:22.959 --> 20:25.374
nor heaven peep
through the blanket of the dark

20:25.500 --> 20:28.333
to cry, "Hold, hold!"

20:31.125 --> 20:35.208
Hie thee hither
that I may pour my spirits in thine ear

20:35.334 --> 20:38.083
and chastise with the valour of my tongue

20:38.209 --> 20:42.291
all that impedes thee
from the golden round.

21:43.750 --> 21:47.291
Thy letters have transported me
beyond this ignorant present

21:48.417 --> 21:51.958
and I feel now the future in the instant.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.124
My dearest love,

22:04.459 --> 22:06.666
Duncan comes here tonight.

22:08.709 --> 22:10.458
And when goes hence?

22:11.625 --> 22:13.874
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.541
O never shall sun that morrow see!

22:30.084 --> 22:33.416
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor,

22:35.084 --> 22:37.791
and shalt be what thou art promised.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.791
Yet I do fear thy nature.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.916
It is too full o' the milk
of human kindness

22:51.042 --> 22:52.624
to catch the nearest way.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.291
Thou wouldst be great.

22:58.417 --> 23:02.874
Art not without ambition
but without the illness should attend it.

23:05.375 --> 23:08.958
To beguile the time, look like the time.

23:10.667 --> 23:15.416
Bear welcome in your eye,
your hand, your tongue.

23:16.667 --> 23:19.749
Look like the innocent flower
but be the serpent under't.

23:25.375 --> 23:28.208
He that's coming must be provided for

23:28.334 --> 23:31.874
and you shall put this night's
great business into my dispatch

23:34.292 --> 23:38.499
which shall,
to all our nights and days to come,

23:39.500 --> 23:43.083
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.958
We will speak further.

24:13.875 --> 24:18.124
All our service, in every point
twice done and then done double.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.208
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.

24:23.334 --> 24:26.624
We love him highly and shall continue
our graces towards him.

24:28.042 --> 24:29.874
By your leave, hostess.

25:27.709 --> 25:28.958
My plenteous...

25:30.500 --> 25:31.499
Up!

25:32.292 --> 25:33.499
Up!

25:37.667 --> 25:40.249
My plenteous joys,

25:40.375 --> 25:43.124
wanton in fulness,

25:43.250 --> 25:46.249
seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.166
Sons,

25:51.292 --> 25:52.416
kinsmen,

25:54.167 --> 25:55.499
thanes,

25:56.459 --> 26:00.249
and you whose places are the nearest,

26:00.375 --> 26:06.333
know that we will establish our estate
upon our eldest, Malcolm,

26:09.417 --> 26:14.666
whom we name hereafter
the Prince of Cumberland.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.624
'The Prince of Cumberland.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.416
'That is a step on which I must fall down,
or else o'erleap,

26:29.542 --> 26:31.541
'for in my way it lies.'

26:36.167 --> 26:38.666
If it were done when 'tis done,

26:41.084 --> 26:42.999
then 'twere well it were done quickly.

26:46.792 --> 26:49.416
If the assassination
could trammel up the consequence

26:49.542 --> 26:52.458
and catch with his surcease success,

26:53.584 --> 26:56.541
that but this blow might be
the be-all and end-all here.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.666
But here upon this bank and shoal of time

27:01.792 --> 27:03.416
we'd jump the life to come.

27:04.417 --> 27:06.374
Does anybody know what this is?

27:06.500 --> 27:09.541
But in these cases we still
have judgement here.

27:09.667 --> 27:13.833
That we but teach bloody instructions
which return to plague the inventor.

27:13.959 --> 27:15.833
This even-handed justice commends

27:15.959 --> 27:18.999
the ingredience of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips.

27:20.459 --> 27:22.249
He's here in double trust.

27:24.459 --> 27:27.083
First, as I am
his kinsman and his subject,

27:27.209 --> 27:29.333
strong both against the deed.

27:29.459 --> 27:32.958
Then, as his host, who should
against his murderer shut the door,

27:33.084 --> 27:34.999
not bear the knife myself.

27:37.959 --> 27:42.999
Besides, this Duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek,

27:43.125 --> 27:45.749
hath been so clear in his great office,

27:45.875 --> 27:48.416
that his virtues would plead like angels,

27:48.542 --> 27:52.541
trumpet-tongued against
the deep damnation of his taking-off.

27:54.084 --> 27:56.416
I have no spur
to prick the sides of my intent

27:56.542 --> 27:58.999
but only vaulting ambition

27:59.125 --> 28:02.208
which o'erleaps itself
and falls on the other.

28:36.084 --> 28:38.666
We will proceed no further
in this business.

28:41.750 --> 28:45.083
Was the hope drunk
wherein you dressed yourself?

28:47.042 --> 28:49.249
Hath it slept since?

28:49.375 --> 28:51.874
And wakes it now to look so green and pale

28:52.000 --> 28:53.833
at what it did so freely?

29:01.125 --> 29:02.708
From this time

29:02.834 --> 29:04.874
such I account thy love.

29:07.917 --> 29:11.083
Art thou afeard to be the same
in thine own act and valour

29:11.209 --> 29:12.874
as thou art in desire?

29:14.334 --> 29:17.874
Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem'st the ornament of life

29:18.000 --> 29:19.874
and live a coward in thy own esteem,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.624
letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"?

29:22.750 --> 29:24.749
Prithee, peace.

29:26.459 --> 29:29.124
I dare do all that may become a man.

29:31.042 --> 29:33.291
Who dares do more is none.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.249
What beast was't, then,

29:38.375 --> 29:41.041
that made you break this enterprise to me?

29:42.292 --> 29:44.833
When you durst do it, then you were a man.

29:47.167 --> 29:49.124
And to be more than what you were,

29:49.250 --> 29:51.624
you would be so much more the man.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.083
I have given suck

29:59.042 --> 30:03.041
and know how tender 'tis
to love the babe that milks me.

30:04.334 --> 30:07.833
I would, while it was smiling in my face,

30:07.959 --> 30:10.874
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums

30:11.000 --> 30:12.333
and dashed the brains out

30:12.459 --> 30:16.041
had I so sworn, as you have done, to this.

30:19.167 --> 30:20.916
If we should fail?

30:28.334 --> 30:30.166
We fail.

30:33.167 --> 30:36.749
But screw your courage
to the sticking place

30:36.875 --> 30:39.708
and we'll not fail.

31:06.459 --> 31:08.166
When Duncan is asleep

31:08.292 --> 31:12.708
his two chamberlains will I
with wine and wassail so convince

31:12.834 --> 31:17.249
that memory, the warder of the brain,
shall be a-fume

31:17.375 --> 31:19.958
and the receipt of reason a limbeck only.

31:21.292 --> 31:25.458
When in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death

31:25.584 --> 31:29.458
what cannot you and I perform
upon the unguarded Duncan?

31:30.709 --> 31:33.333
What not put upon his spongy officers

31:33.459 --> 31:36.208
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

31:55.625 --> 31:57.249
I am settled

32:01.042 --> 32:04.541
and bend up each corporal agent
to this terrible feat.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.499
Take my sword.

32:31.292 --> 32:33.333
Take thee that too.

32:49.209 --> 32:51.833
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me

32:53.000 --> 32:55.208
and yet I would not sleep.

32:58.209 --> 32:59.999
Merciful powers,

33:01.375 --> 33:05.374
restrain in me the cursed thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose.

33:54.792 --> 33:57.374
Is this a dagger which I see before me?

34:06.750 --> 34:08.583
The handle toward my hand.

34:13.375 --> 34:14.373
Come,

34:18.208 --> 34:20.708
let me clutch thee.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.998
Art thou not, fatal vision,

34:29.125 --> 34:31.373
sensible to feeling as to sight?

34:36.458 --> 34:38.583
Or art thou but a dagger of the mind?

34:41.292 --> 34:44.958
A false creation, proceeding
from the heat-oppressed brain.

34:53.542 --> 34:56.041
Thou marshall'st me
the way that I was going

34:56.167 --> 34:59.374
and such an instrument I was to use.

35:04.209 --> 35:06.499
Mine eyes are made the fools
o' the other senses.

35:06.625 --> 35:09.541
Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still.

35:16.542 --> 35:18.916
There's no such thing.

35:19.042 --> 35:22.458
It is the bloody business
which informs thus to mine eyes.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.791
Now, o'er the one half-world,

35:26.917 --> 35:28.874
nature seems dead

35:29.500 --> 35:32.916
and wicked dreams abuse
the curtained sleep.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.958
Witchcraft celebrates

35:35.084 --> 35:38.083
and withered murder moves like a ghost.

35:51.292 --> 35:53.208
I see thee yet,

35:54.250 --> 35:57.791
in form as palpable
as this which now I draw.

36:00.167 --> 36:02.333
Whiles I threat, he lives.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.541
Words to the heat of deeds
too cold breath gives.

38:02.875 --> 38:04.083
The spring,

38:04.625 --> 38:05.833
the head,

38:06.917 --> 38:10.291
the fountain of your blood is stopped.

38:10.417 --> 38:12.374
The very source of it is stopped.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.249
Here lies Duncan,

38:17.375 --> 38:21.374
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.416
There the murderers,

38:24.542 --> 38:27.083
steeped in the colours of their trade.

38:32.167 --> 38:36.666
Had I but died an hour before this chance,

38:37.875 --> 38:40.291
I had lived a blessed time.

38:42.334 --> 38:44.416
But from this instant

38:44.542 --> 38:47.374
there's nothing serious in mortality.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.833
All is but toys.

38:51.834 --> 38:53.791
Renown and grace is dead.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.874
The wine of life is drawn

39:00.000 --> 39:03.458
and the mere lees is left
this vault to brag of.

39:16.125 --> 39:17.208
Live you?

39:19.042 --> 39:21.791
Or are you aught that man may question?

40:17.250 --> 40:18.999
I have done the deed.

40:27.417 --> 40:29.666
Why did you bring these daggers
from the place?

40:32.542 --> 40:34.124
They must lie there.

41:09.584 --> 41:11.666
What hands are here?

41:27.042 --> 41:29.541
'They pluck out mine eyes.'

41:30.959 --> 41:37.083
Will all great Neptune's ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand?

41:38.959 --> 41:40.624
No,

41:40.750 --> 41:46.666
this my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,

41:48.709 --> 41:52.333
making the green one red.

41:57.250 --> 42:00.291
My hands are of your colour,

42:00.417 --> 42:02.624
but I shame to wear a heart so white.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.541
A little water clears us of this deed.

42:11.667 --> 42:13.458
How easy is it then.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.999
To know my deed

42:20.125 --> 42:22.208
'twere best not know myself.

43:19.542 --> 43:20.624
Good Macduff.

43:20.750 --> 43:22.166
Good morrow, noble sir.

43:22.292 --> 43:23.958
Good morrow, both.

43:24.084 --> 43:26.458
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?

43:27.542 --> 43:30.041
- The King, is he stirring?
- Not yet.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.791
He did command me to call timely on him.

43:33.917 --> 43:35.666
I have almost slipped the hour.

43:36.959 --> 43:38.583
I'll bring you to him.

43:54.292 --> 43:56.708
I'll make so bold to call.

44:05.917 --> 44:09.249
- Goes the King hence today?
- He does; he did appoint so.

44:12.834 --> 44:14.666
The night has been unruly.

44:17.542 --> 44:20.374
Where we lay, our temples were blown down

44:22.167 --> 44:23.916
and, as they say,

44:24.042 --> 44:27.749
lamentings heard in the air,

44:27.875 --> 44:30.791
strange screams of death.

44:32.917 --> 44:34.333
'Twas a rough night.

44:49.750 --> 44:55.416
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.

44:55.542 --> 44:58.541
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke open

44:58.667 --> 45:00.166
the Lord's anointed temple

45:00.292 --> 45:03.666
and stole thence the life of the building.

45:05.167 --> 45:06.249
The life?

45:06.375 --> 45:07.999
Mean you His Majesty?

45:08.125 --> 45:10.916
Bid me not speak. You see.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.041
Speak yourselves.

45:31.375 --> 45:33.833
Awake!

45:33.959 --> 45:35.083
Awake!

45:35.209 --> 45:37.874
Ring the alarum bells!

45:38.000 --> 45:39.291
Malcolm!

45:40.667 --> 45:41.666
Malcolm!

45:41.792 --> 45:43.541
Banquo!

45:45.000 --> 45:47.249
Ring the alarum bells.

45:47.375 --> 45:48.666
Banquo!

45:49.334 --> 45:52.291
Shake off your downy sleep, man.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.416
Death's counterfeit.
You come and look on death itself.

45:55.542 --> 45:56.916
Huh?

45:57.917 --> 45:59.833
Murder!

45:59.959 --> 46:01.166
Treason!

46:20.000 --> 46:21.958
What's the business?

46:22.084 --> 46:26.083
Our royal master, he's murdered.

46:27.125 --> 46:29.374
- Murdered?
- Murdered!

46:29.500 --> 46:31.708
Those of his chamber,

46:31.834 --> 46:34.624
their hands were all badged with blood.

46:54.334 --> 46:55.958
Wherefore did you so?

46:56.084 --> 46:57.666
Hm?

46:57.792 --> 47:01.208
Who could refrain that had a heart to love

47:01.334 --> 47:05.749
and in that heart
courage to make love known?

47:35.750 --> 47:38.166
How it does grieve Macbeth.

47:41.875 --> 47:44.166
Did he not straight, in pious rage,

47:44.292 --> 47:46.958
the two delinquents tear

47:47.792 --> 47:49.999
that were the slaves of drink?

47:50.125 --> 47:52.624
Was this not nobly done?

47:52.750 --> 47:54.333
Ay.

47:54.459 --> 47:57.291
'Twould have angered any heart alive
to hear the men deny it.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.458
I say he has borne all things well.

48:01.334 --> 48:03.791
Is't known who did
this more than bloody deed?

48:06.334 --> 48:08.833
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

48:08.959 --> 48:12.874
Alas, the day.
What good could they pretend?

48:13.000 --> 48:17.624
Malcolm, the King's son,
is stolen away and fled,

48:17.750 --> 48:20.791
which puts upon him suspicion of the deed.

48:20.917 --> 48:23.541
'Tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon Macbeth.

48:24.375 --> 48:26.124
He is already named.

48:45.709 --> 48:48.208
'Thou hast it now.

48:48.334 --> 48:50.583
'King, Cawdor,

48:51.584 --> 48:53.291
'Glamis,

48:53.417 --> 48:56.458
'all as the weird women promised.

48:56.584 --> 49:00.041
'And I fear
thou playedst most foully for't.

49:00.167 --> 49:03.499
'Yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity.'

49:05.000 --> 49:08.583
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.

49:08.709 --> 49:11.583
If there come truth from them,

49:11.709 --> 49:15.999
why, by the verities on thee made good,
may they not be my oracles as well

49:17.334 --> 49:18.708
and set me up in hope?

49:23.334 --> 49:25.666
But hush.

49:25.792 --> 49:27.208
No more.

49:28.625 --> 49:33.791
Hail, Macbeth.

49:33.917 --> 49:36.666
Hail, Macbeth. Hail, Macbeth.

49:44.584 --> 49:46.208
Hail, Macbeth.

49:46.334 --> 49:47.833
Hail, Macbeth.

50:42.209 --> 50:46.291
'To be thus... is nothing,

50:46.417 --> 50:48.374
'but to be safely thus!

50:51.459 --> 50:55.041
'Our fears in Banquo stick deep.'

50:55.167 --> 51:00.624
And in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be feared.

51:02.209 --> 51:03.624
'Tis much he dares

51:03.750 --> 51:07.416
and to that dauntless temper
of his mind...

51:10.292 --> 51:15.458
...he hath a wisdom
that doth guide his valour.

51:26.042 --> 51:30.083
How now, my Lord? Why do you keep alone?

51:31.459 --> 51:33.791
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.

51:35.542 --> 51:39.541
She'll close and be herself

51:39.667 --> 51:42.916
whilst our poor malice remains
in danger of her former tooth.

51:47.417 --> 51:50.166
Things without all remedy
should be without regard.

51:53.209 --> 51:54.749
What's done is done.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.166
Come, gentle my Lord.

52:03.917 --> 52:06.583
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.

52:06.709 --> 52:11.249
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.833
Thou know'st that Banquo,
and his Fleance, lives?

52:28.375 --> 52:30.166
You must leave this.

52:42.459 --> 52:44.791
He chid the sisters

52:44.917 --> 52:47.999
when first they put
the name of king upon me

52:48.125 --> 52:49.749
and bade them speak to him.

52:51.209 --> 52:56.958
Then, prophet-like,
they hailed him father to a line of kings.

52:57.542 --> 53:00.083
Upon my head

53:00.209 --> 53:02.166
they placed a fruitless crown

53:02.292 --> 53:04.833
and put a barren sceptre in my grip,

53:04.959 --> 53:08.083
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand,

53:10.375 --> 53:12.791
no son of mine succeeding.

53:15.500 --> 53:16.999
If it be so,

53:19.792 --> 53:22.874
for Banquo's issue have I filed my mind.

53:25.792 --> 53:27.583
For them

53:27.709 --> 53:30.291
the gracious Duncan have I murdered,

53:30.417 --> 53:33.958
put rancours in the vessel of my peace

53:34.084 --> 53:36.083
only for them.

53:37.667 --> 53:39.291
To make them kings,

53:41.834 --> 53:46.791
the seed of Banquo kings!

53:49.834 --> 53:51.666
What's to be done?

53:52.875 --> 53:55.999
Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck,

53:56.125 --> 53:58.666
till thou applaud the deed.

54:02.334 --> 54:05.166
Full, full of scorpions, is my mind.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.999
Thou marvell'st at my words.

54:19.875 --> 54:22.124
Hold thee still.

54:22.250 --> 54:27.499
Things bad begun
make themselves strong by ill.

54:32.750 --> 54:34.874
Come, seeling night.

54:36.417 --> 54:39.874
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day

54:40.000 --> 54:44.541
and, with thy bloody and invisible hand,

54:44.667 --> 54:46.874
cancel...

54:47.000 --> 54:50.749
and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale.

55:29.209 --> 55:30.208
Get up!

55:51.959 --> 55:54.083
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,

55:55.250 --> 55:58.124
and I'll request your presence.

55:58.250 --> 56:01.249
Let Your Highness command upon me
to the which my duties are,

56:01.375 --> 56:04.624
with a most indissoluble tie,
forever knit.

56:13.250 --> 56:14.749
Ride you this afternoon?

56:16.625 --> 56:18.166
Ay, my good Lord.

56:20.792 --> 56:24.291
We should have else desired
your good advice in this day's council,

56:25.834 --> 56:27.458
but we'll take tomorrow.

56:30.959 --> 56:32.333
Is't far you ride?

56:34.000 --> 56:37.208
As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper,

56:38.209 --> 56:40.208
go not my horse the better.

56:42.792 --> 56:44.874
Fail not our feast.

56:47.542 --> 56:49.208
My Lord, I will not.

56:59.584 --> 57:03.208
We hear our bloody cousin
is bestowed in England,

57:03.334 --> 57:05.749
not confessing his cruel parricide,

57:05.875 --> 57:08.749
filling his hearers with strange invention.

57:16.250 --> 57:17.666
But of that tomorrow.

57:18.667 --> 57:20.333
Hie you to horse.

57:20.459 --> 57:24.333
Adieu, till you return at night.

57:27.292 --> 57:28.708
Goes Fleance with you?

57:38.042 --> 57:42.666
Ay, my good Lord.
Our time does call upon's.

57:45.375 --> 57:46.916
Farewell.

58:13.625 --> 58:15.041
Within this hour, at most,

58:15.167 --> 58:17.874
I will advise you
where to plant yourselves,

58:19.834 --> 58:23.708
acquaint you with the perfect spy
o' the time the moment on't,

58:23.834 --> 58:27.666
for it must be done tonight,
and something from the palace.

58:27.792 --> 58:30.541
Always thought that I require a clearness.

58:34.709 --> 58:36.083
And with him,

58:38.167 --> 58:40.791
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work,

58:42.000 --> 58:45.458
Fleance, his son that keeps him company,

58:45.584 --> 58:50.208
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father's,

58:51.334 --> 58:54.416
must embrace the fate of that dark hour.

59:21.834 --> 59:23.458
Fly!

59:30.292 --> 59:33.249
Fly, Fleance! Fly!

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.624
Hail, Macbeth! Hail, Macbeth!

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.791
Hail, Macbeth!

01:00:42.584 --> 01:00:44.833
You know your own degrees.

01:00:44.959 --> 01:00:48.416
Sit down. At first and last,
the hearty welcome.

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:00.666
Our hostess keeps her state

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:05.833
but in best time
we will require her welcome.

01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:10.541
Pronounce it for me, sir,
to all our friends,

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.666
for my heart speaks they are welcome.

01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:14.958
Your Majesty.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.416
Be large in mirth, anon,

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.208
we'll drink a measure the table round.

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:29.374
There's blood upon thy face.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:33.208
'Tis Banquo's then.

01:01:34.167 --> 01:01:35.749
Is he dispatched?

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.791
My Lord, his throat is cut.

01:01:37.917 --> 01:01:39.791
He's good that did the like for Fleance.

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:41.874
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.749
Most royal sir, Fleance is scaped.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:53.124
Then comes my fit again.

01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:59.291
I had else been perfect,

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:04.041
whole as the marble, founded as the rock,

01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:06.458
as broad and general as the casing air.

01:02:07.209 --> 01:02:09.583
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined,

01:02:09.709 --> 01:02:12.499
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:15.124
My royal Lord, you do not give the cheer.

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.291
Thanks for that.

01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:25.166
Sweet remembrancer!

01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:29.666
Now, good digestion wait on appetite

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.999
and health on both.

01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:36.083
Here had we now
our country's honour roofed,

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:39.249
were the graced person
of our Banquo present,

01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:44.083
who may I rather challenge for unkindness

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:46.083
than pity for mischance.

01:02:46.209 --> 01:02:49.999
His absence, sir,
lays blame upon his promise.

01:02:56.625 --> 01:02:58.999
What is't that moves Your Highness?

01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:09.958
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my good Lord?

01:03:12.959 --> 01:03:15.249
Thou canst not say that I did it.

01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:20.624
His Highness is not well.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:23.083
Sit, worthy friends.

01:03:25.417 --> 01:03:27.624
Pray you, keep seat.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:28.833
The fit is momentary.

01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:31.083
Upon a thought he will again be well.

01:03:31.209 --> 01:03:33.458
If much you note him, you shall offend him

01:03:33.584 --> 01:03:36.124
and extend his passion.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:40.083
Feed and regard him not.

01:03:42.334 --> 01:03:43.916
Are you a man?

01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:50.624
Ay, and a bold one that dare look on that
which might appal the devil.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.958
O proper stuff!

01:03:53.084 --> 01:03:55.833
Prithee, see there.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:03:59.666
Behold.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.416
Look, lo! How say you?

01:04:02.417 --> 01:04:04.999
This is the very painting of your fear.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:08.583
This is the air-drawn dagger
which you said led you to Duncan.

01:04:09.792 --> 01:04:12.708
Why do you make such faces?

01:04:15.959 --> 01:04:18.416
If I stand here, I saw him.

01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:24.166
My worthy Lord,
your noble friends do lack you.

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:27.708
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:30.083
The time has been that,
when the brains were out,

01:04:30.209 --> 01:04:32.249
the man would die

01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:33.999
and there an end.

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:37.541
But now they rise again
and push us from our stools.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.791
This is more strange
than such a murder is.

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:51.958
I do forget.

01:04:55.042 --> 01:04:56.416
Come.

01:04:57.875 --> 01:04:59.333
Love and health to all.

01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:06.374
Our duties and the pledge.

01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:17.249
Avaunt and quit my sight.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:21.541
Let the earth hide thee.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.749
Thy bones are marrowless,
thy blood is cold.

01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:29.749
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,
which thou dost glare with.

01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:35.624
Think of this, good peers...

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:40.041
...but as a thing of custom.

01:05:40.167 --> 01:05:41.999
'Tis no other.

01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:45.208
I pray you, sit still.

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:02.249
You make me strange,

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.458
even to the disposition that I owe

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:13.499
when now I think
you can behold such sights

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:19.624
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine is blanched with fear.

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:24.458
- What sights, my Lord?
- I pray you, speak not.

01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:29.499
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.

01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:32.874
Stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.208
Good night,
and better health attend His Majesty.

01:06:36.334 --> 01:06:38.374
A kind good-night to all.

01:06:46.709 --> 01:06:48.291
It will have blood.

01:06:50.292 --> 01:06:53.333
They say blood will have blood.

01:07:02.834 --> 01:07:04.541
What is the night?

01:07:08.584 --> 01:07:11.666
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:19.291
How say'st thou
that Macduff denies his person

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:21.583
at our great bidding?

01:07:23.167 --> 01:07:25.416
You lack the season of all natures.

01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:28.874
Sleep.

01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:34.833
'I will to the Weird Sisters.

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:38.333
'More shall they speak.

01:07:38.459 --> 01:07:41.999
'For now I am bent to know
by the worst means the worst.

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:47.666
'For mine own good,
all causes shall give way.

01:07:52.584 --> 01:07:57.249
'I am in blood stepped in so far that,
should I wade no more,

01:07:58.209 --> 01:08:00.791
'returning were as tedious as go o'er.

01:08:02.375 --> 01:08:05.874
'Strange things I have in head
that will to hand,

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:10.124
'which must be acted
ere they may be scanned.'

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:32.374
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
howe'er you come to know it,

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:36.457
answer me.

01:08:40.542 --> 01:08:43.541
Speak, I charge you.

01:09:10.084 --> 01:09:12.624
Be lion-mettled, proud,

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:17.374
and take no care who chafes,
who frets, or where conspirers are.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.124
Macbeth shall never vanquished be.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.791
Until Great Birnam Wood
to high Dunsinane Hill

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.541
shall come against him.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:05.208
Beware Macduff.

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.999
Beware the Thane of Fife.

01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:08.791
Dismiss me, enough.

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:11.583
- Beware Macduff.
- Beware Macduff.

01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:14.458
- Beware the Thane of Fife.
- Beware Macduff.

01:10:14.584 --> 01:10:16.124
Beware the Thane of Fife.

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:19.749
- Beware the Thane of Fife.
- Beware Macduff.

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:22.041
Beware the Thane of Fife.

01:10:25.334 --> 01:10:26.749
Be bloody,

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:32.041
bold, and resolute.

01:10:35.625 --> 01:10:37.333
Laugh to scorn the power of man,

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:43.999
for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:05.416
Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.124
But yet I'll make assurance double sure

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.083
and take a bond of fate:
thou shalt not live.

01:11:49.834 --> 01:11:51.416
Saw you the Weird Sisters?

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.499
No, my Lord.

01:11:53.625 --> 01:11:55.499
Came they not by you?

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:59.583
No, indeed, my Lord.

01:12:01.959 --> 01:12:04.916
Infected be the air whereon they ride

01:12:05.042 --> 01:12:07.166
and damned all those that trust them!

01:12:22.167 --> 01:12:24.374
'Who was't came by?'

01:12:25.292 --> 01:12:30.249
'Tis two or three, my Lord,
that bring you word.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.166
Macduff has fled to England.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.749
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good Lord.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:47.666
The flighty purpose never is overtook
unless the deed go with it.

01:12:50.875 --> 01:12:54.208
The very firstlings of my heart
shall be the firstlings of my hand.

01:12:54.334 --> 01:12:55.666
Be it thought and done.

01:13:04.917 --> 01:13:06.541
Hell is murky.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.041
What's done cannot be undone.

01:13:16.334 --> 01:13:18.624
Skirr the country round.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.874
Hang those that talk of fear.

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:26.666
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
seize upon Fife,

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:29.041
give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes,

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:32.166
and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.

01:13:33.959 --> 01:13:35.708
No boasting like a fool.

01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:37.791
This deed I'll do
before this purpose cool.

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.166
Murder!

01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:58.374
Murder!

01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:01.124
Murder!

01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:06.041
I have done no harm!

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:07.874
I have done no harm!

01:14:09.167 --> 01:14:11.083
Murder!

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:17.458
Murder!

01:14:17.584 --> 01:14:18.874
No!

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.499
No, please, my babies!

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.416
No!

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:28.249
Bring me no more reports.

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:30.291
Let them fly all.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:34.958
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane

01:14:35.084 --> 01:14:37.249
I cannot taint with fear.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.249
What's the boy Malcolm?

01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:43.374
Was he not born of woman?

01:14:44.584 --> 01:14:47.999
The spirits that know
all mortal consequence

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:49.708
have pronounced me thus:

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.708
"Fear not, Macbeth.

01:14:52.834 --> 01:14:57.583
"No man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee."

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.166
Then fly, false thanes,

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:08.374
and mingle with the English epicures.

01:15:15.417 --> 01:15:17.458
Why are you silent?

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:20.791
This tyrant,

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.124
whose sole name blisters our tongues,

01:15:27.584 --> 01:15:31.333
was once thought honest.

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:12.124
Now is the time of help.

01:17:14.042 --> 01:17:16.999
Your eye in Scotland

01:17:17.125 --> 01:17:19.583
would create soldiers,

01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:24.374
make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses.

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.999
Be it their comfort we are coming thither.

01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:33.208
I have words

01:17:33.334 --> 01:17:36.333
that would be howled in the desert air

01:17:37.542 --> 01:17:40.166
where hearing should not latch them.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:46.416
My ever gentle cousin.

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.791
Stands Scotland where it did?

01:17:48.917 --> 01:17:50.999
Alas, poor country,

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.166
it's almost afraid to know itself.

01:17:54.417 --> 01:17:56.999
It cannot be called our mother
but our graves.

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:05.249
What's our newest grief?

01:18:08.459 --> 01:18:12.124
Let not your ears despise my tongue
which shall possess them

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:15.124
with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard.

01:18:20.417 --> 01:18:22.499
How does my wife?

01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:27.249
Your castle is surprised,

01:18:29.959 --> 01:18:33.999
your wife and babes savagely slaughtered.

01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:45.124
What man, hm?

01:18:48.167 --> 01:18:49.374
What man?

01:18:54.417 --> 01:18:55.999
My children too?

01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:05.166
Wife, children, servants,

01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:06.916
all that could be found.

01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:21.374
He has no children!

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:30.499
All my pretty chickens

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:32.416
and their dam,

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.458
in one fell swoop?

01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:46.791
Dispute it like a man.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.749
Oh...

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:54.791
Oh, I will do so.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.333
But I will also feel it as a man.

01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:07.208
Sinful Macduff!

01:20:09.292 --> 01:20:12.083
They were all struck for thee.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:16.249
Be this the whetstone of your sword.

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:19.166
Let grief convert to anger.

01:20:19.292 --> 01:20:21.916
Blunt not the heart, enrage it.

01:20:23.584 --> 01:20:27.791
Gracious England hath lent us
ten thousand men.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:29.958
Our power is ready.

01:20:30.084 --> 01:20:32.458
Our lack is nothing but our leave.

01:20:35.667 --> 01:20:38.624
Front to front

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:42.666
you bring thou
this fiend of Scotland and myself,

01:20:42.792 --> 01:20:46.374
and within my sword's length you set him.

01:20:53.959 --> 01:20:56.416
If he scape,

01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:58.374
heaven forgive him too.

01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:18.249
'Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:21.416
'Some say he's mad.

01:21:23.459 --> 01:21:25.291
'Others, lesser, that hate him

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:27.666
'do call it valiant fury.'

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.666
But, for certain,

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:36.666
he cannot buckle his distempered cause
within the belt of rule.

01:21:39.584 --> 01:21:42.541
Those he commands

01:21:42.667 --> 01:21:44.916
move only in command.

01:21:46.959 --> 01:21:48.749
'Nothing in love.

01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:51.791
'Now does he feel

01:21:52.792 --> 01:21:56.041
'his secret murders
sticking on his hands.'

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.166
Yet here's a spot.

01:22:41.292 --> 01:22:43.499
Out, damned spot!

01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:46.583
Out, I say!

01:22:50.084 --> 01:22:51.916
Hell is murky.

01:22:56.042 --> 01:22:57.666
Fie, my Lord!

01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:59.958
Fie!

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.833
A soldier and afeard?

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:09.208
What need we fear who knows it

01:23:09.334 --> 01:23:12.124
when none can call our power to account?

01:23:17.167 --> 01:23:18.583
Yet who would have thought

01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:22.208
the old man to have had
so much blood in him?

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:32.208
The Thane of Fife had a wife.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.833
Where is she now?

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.249
What?

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:48.166
Will these hands ne'er be clean?

01:23:52.292 --> 01:23:54.541
No more o' that, my Lord.

01:23:55.834 --> 01:23:57.458
No more o' that.

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:00.999
You mar all with this starting.

01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:12.833
Here's the smell of the blood still.

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:20.291
All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.

01:24:35.042 --> 01:24:36.624
Wash your hands.

01:24:37.584 --> 01:24:39.833
Put on your nightgown.

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:43.208
Look not so pale.

01:24:45.125 --> 01:24:46.208
To bed.

01:24:47.834 --> 01:24:49.083
To bed.

01:24:53.125 --> 01:24:55.499
There's knocking at the gate.

01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:01.333
Come.

01:25:03.084 --> 01:25:05.166
Come.

01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:08.249
Come, come, give me your hand.

01:25:11.417 --> 01:25:14.291
What's done cannot be undone.

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:16.708
To bed.

01:25:18.334 --> 01:25:19.749
To bed.

01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:27.333
To bed.

01:26:06.584 --> 01:26:07.791
To bed.

01:26:10.292 --> 01:26:11.624
To bed.

01:26:14.584 --> 01:26:16.208
To bed.

01:26:42.042 --> 01:26:45.624
The devil damn thee black,
thou cream-faced loon.

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:48.458
Where got'st thou that goose look?

01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:49.791
There's ten thousand.

01:26:50.917 --> 01:26:52.541
Geese, villain?

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.833
Soldiers, sir.

01:26:56.459 --> 01:26:58.999
Go, prick thy face and over-red thy fear,

01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:00.791
thou lily-livered boy.

01:27:02.209 --> 01:27:04.583
What soldiers, patch?

01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:08.416
The English force, so please you.

01:27:11.334 --> 01:27:14.541
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.

01:27:17.459 --> 01:27:19.791
The cry is still, "They come!"

01:27:23.584 --> 01:27:27.958
Our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn.

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:33.666
Here let them lie

01:27:33.792 --> 01:27:36.666
till famine and the ague eat them up.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.249
Doctor.

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:57.791
The thanes fly from me.

01:28:01.125 --> 01:28:04.333
What rhubarb, cyme or what purgative drug

01:28:04.459 --> 01:28:06.499
would scour these English hence?

01:28:06.625 --> 01:28:07.999
Hear'st thou of them?

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:10.874
Ay, my good Lord.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.333
Your royal preparation
makes us hear something.

01:28:14.459 --> 01:28:17.583
If thou couldst, Doctor,

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:20.416
cast the water of my land,
find her disease

01:28:20.542 --> 01:28:22.999
and purge it
to a sound and pristine health.

01:28:25.292 --> 01:28:28.291
I would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again.

01:28:32.042 --> 01:28:36.041
The Queen, my Lord, is dead.

01:29:02.834 --> 01:29:05.666
She should have died hereafter.

01:29:07.917 --> 01:29:10.749
There would have been a time
for such a word.

01:29:20.125 --> 01:29:21.499
Tomorrow,

01:29:27.084 --> 01:29:29.166
and tomorrow,

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:35.249
and tomorrow

01:29:37.875 --> 01:29:41.958
creeps in this petty pace from day to day

01:29:44.584 --> 01:29:47.458
to the last syllable of recorded time.

01:29:51.292 --> 01:29:55.583
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.333
Out.

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:08.666
Out, brief candle.

01:30:10.917 --> 01:30:13.833
Life's but a walking shadow,

01:30:13.959 --> 01:30:15.791
a poor player

01:30:15.917 --> 01:30:20.041
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

01:30:20.167 --> 01:30:21.958
and then is heard no more.

01:30:24.584 --> 01:30:27.416
It is a tale told by an idiot,

01:30:28.792 --> 01:30:30.708
full of sound and fury,

01:30:32.042 --> 01:30:33.874
signifying nothing.

01:30:38.959 --> 01:30:41.249
What is that noise?

01:30:41.375 --> 01:30:44.124
It is the cry of women, my good Lord.

01:30:49.084 --> 01:30:51.833
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.749
The time has been

01:30:57.875 --> 01:31:00.791
my senses would have cooled
to hear a night-shriek

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:04.666
and my fell of hair

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:08.499
would, at a dismal treatise,
rouse and stir

01:31:08.625 --> 01:31:10.374
as life were in't.

01:31:16.917 --> 01:31:20.666
I have supped full with horrors.

01:31:20.792 --> 01:31:23.166
Direness, familiar
to my slaughterous thoughts,

01:31:23.292 --> 01:31:25.249
cannot once start me.

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.833
Thy story, quickly.

01:31:40.459 --> 01:31:41.958
Gracious my Lord,

01:31:43.959 --> 01:31:46.499
I should report that which I say I saw,

01:31:50.042 --> 01:31:51.874
but know not how to do it.

01:32:01.334 --> 01:32:02.333
Seyton!

01:32:03.542 --> 01:32:05.874
I am sick at heart when I behold.

01:32:06.792 --> 01:32:08.791
Seyton, I say!

01:32:19.042 --> 01:32:21.416
This push will chair me ever

01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:24.833
or dis-seat me now.

01:32:36.917 --> 01:32:38.791
I have lived long enough.

01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:44.083
My way of life is fallen into the sere,

01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:49.749
the yellow leaf.

01:32:51.917 --> 01:32:54.291
And that which should
accompany old age as...

01:32:56.667 --> 01:32:59.291
...honour,

01:32:59.417 --> 01:33:00.833
love,

01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.541
obedience,

01:33:03.667 --> 01:33:05.291
troops of friends,

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:10.958
I must not look to have,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.458
but, in their stead,

01:33:17.917 --> 01:33:19.416
curses,

01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:25.124
not loud,

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:29.041
but deep, mouth-honour, breath,

01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:35.916
which the poor heart would fain deny
and dare not.

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:41.749
Seyton.

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:45.333
All is confirmed, my Lord,
which was reported.

01:33:47.042 --> 01:33:50.624
I'll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:53.749
- Give me my armour.
- 'Tis not needed yet.

01:33:53.875 --> 01:33:55.458
I'll put it on!

01:34:45.917 --> 01:34:48.958
And now a wood comes toward Dunsinane.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.708
Ring the alarum bell.

01:34:58.667 --> 01:35:03.624
Arm, arm, and out!

01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:13.499
Tyrant, show thy face!

01:35:21.292 --> 01:35:24.291
There is nor flying hence
nor tarrying here.

01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:27.749
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun

01:35:27.875 --> 01:35:30.416
and wish the estate o' the world
were now undone.

01:35:31.209 --> 01:35:32.833
Blow, wind.

01:35:32.959 --> 01:35:35.708
Come, wrack.

01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:39.374
At least we'll die
with harness on our back.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.833
'They have tied me to a stake.

01:35:45.959 --> 01:35:48.499
'I cannot fly.

01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:51.624
'But, bear-like, I must fight the course.

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:56.583
'What's he that was not born of woman?

01:35:57.375 --> 01:36:00.333
'Such a one am I to fear, or none.

01:36:00.459 --> 01:36:04.666
'Why should I play the Roman fool
and die on mine own sword?'

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:09.208
Whiles I see lives,
the gashes do better upon them.

01:36:10.167 --> 01:36:12.083
Turn, hellhound.

01:36:12.209 --> 01:36:13.499
Turn.

01:36:19.542 --> 01:36:22.749
Of all men else I have avoided thee.

01:36:22.875 --> 01:36:24.458
But get thee back.

01:36:25.375 --> 01:36:28.083
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:30.916
I have no words.

01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:34.624
My voice is in my sword.

01:36:55.792 --> 01:36:57.416
Thou losest labour.

01:36:57.542 --> 01:37:02.041
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress

01:37:02.167 --> 01:37:04.374
as make me bleed.

01:38:25.292 --> 01:38:28.958
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.

01:38:29.792 --> 01:38:32.749
I bear a charmed life

01:38:32.875 --> 01:38:36.124
which must not yield to one of woman born.

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:38.833
Despair thy charm

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:44.499
and let the angel
whom thou still hast served tell thee

01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:49.874
Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

01:39:06.084 --> 01:39:08.499
Accursed be the tongue that tells me so,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.166
for it hath cowed my better part of man.

01:39:26.084 --> 01:39:27.749
I'll not fight with thee.

01:40:14.334 --> 01:40:16.374
Then yield thee, coward,

01:40:18.209 --> 01:40:21.541
and live to be
the show and gaze of the time.

01:40:25.417 --> 01:40:29.833
I will have thee,
as our rarer monsters are,

01:40:34.625 --> 01:40:36.416
painted upon a pole,

01:40:38.875 --> 01:40:40.499
and underwrit:

01:40:42.417 --> 01:40:45.208
"Here may you see the tyrant,

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:49.041
"Macbeth."

01:41:06.042 --> 01:41:07.541
I will not yield

01:41:08.417 --> 01:41:11.874
to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.041
and to be baited with the rabble's curse.

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:25.499
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane

01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:28.874
and thou opposed,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.249
being of no woman born,

01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:39.124
yet I will try the last.

01:41:45.792 --> 01:41:49.541
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.

01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:57.916
Lay on, Macduff.

01:42:01.625 --> 01:42:06.333
And damned be him that first cries,

01:42:06.459 --> 01:42:11.124
"Hold, enough!"

01:43:44.542 --> 01:43:48.583
He's worth more sorrow,
and that I'll spend for him.

01:43:50.334 --> 01:43:52.041
He's worth no more.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.999
Hail,

01:44:01.584 --> 01:44:04.333
King of Scotland!

01:44:06.917 --> 01:44:10.583
Hail, King of Scotland!

01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:13.666
Hail, King of Scotland!
