WEBVTT

00:28.020 --> 00:30.106
Yeah, baby, that is hot!

00:30.106 --> 00:32.942
Oh, yeah!

00:33.984 --> 00:39.198
All right, I got a little
game for you, baby.

00:53.129 --> 00:55.214
How'd you like that?

01:18.029 --> 01:20.406
We got a looker.
Twenty-two years old.

01:20.406 --> 01:23.534
Name's Noel Peach.
He's a college student.

01:24.035 --> 01:25.745
Do we know why he
was up here last night?

01:25.745 --> 01:27.705
Well, you know,
some sort of private party.

01:27.705 --> 01:31.167
Not private anymore, is it?
Any sign of what killed him?

01:31.167 --> 01:33.085
I was hoping you could tell me.

01:35.171 --> 01:36.213
Well ...

01:38.466 --> 01:40.551
I guess we can't rule out exposure.

02:31.902 --> 02:36.449
According to his liver temp he died sometime
between five and seven this morning.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.785
No sign of trauma
or obvious injury.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.917
Look at this white substance
around his mouth.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.794
Drugs?

02:48.794 --> 02:51.505
Wouldn't be the first OD at a
Coconut Grove Party, would it?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.842
Substance on his genitals.
Could be semen.

02:57.303 --> 03:01.348
Also found this
-- condom wrapper.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.808
At least he was careful.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.102
And busy.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.442
I have a...

03:11.442 --> 03:15.112
number of different hair samples here.
I'm thinking female.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.782
I've got something.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.744
Culex quinquefasciatus.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.913
Mosquitoes.

03:23.913 --> 03:28.542
Mosquitoes are attracted to circulating blood
and carbon monoxide from breathing,

03:28.542 --> 03:31.879
which means our friend here was
alive when he got bit, doesn't it?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.965
Meaning we might find traces
of any drugs that he took.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.258
I'm bagging you guys.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.510
Speed.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.680
I don't know what the
latin name for this is.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.226
No such luck.
Roman women wore leather straps.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.103
Must have been some
hell of a party.

03:47.103 --> 03:48.938
Speaking of straps ...

03:52.066 --> 03:53.943
Ligature marks.

03:53.943 --> 03:55.986
You think bondage?

03:55.986 --> 03:59.698
Seems contradictory. I mean, what
kind of stud likes to be tied up?

03:59.698 --> 04:02.034
Unless we've got it backwards,
ladies and gentlemen,

04:02.034 --> 04:06.205
and our friend Noel here wasn't
the predator ... he was the prey.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.087
Tough way for a
night to end, huh?

04:14.338 --> 04:17.925
I almost didn't come.
This was my first time.

04:18.968 --> 04:22.053
Your first time?
For what?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.598
A cupcake party.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.726
Cupcake party?

04:28.519 --> 04:29.562
Care to explain that?

04:30.187 --> 04:33.732
Cupcake it's ...

04:33.732 --> 04:38.112
just a grab, basically an enviroment
where woman are charged.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.448
get together and
celebrate a sexuality.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.492
Would you say that that celebration
includes male entertainment like...

04:43.492 --> 04:45.161
Noel Peach?

04:45.161 --> 04:47.997
Yes, there were quite a
few male dancers here.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.629
Would you describe the
entertainment, please?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.132
It was harmless, really.

05:04.263 --> 05:08.434
Harmless. A little harmless lap dance
followed by some harmless sex.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.189
Cupcake isn't about having sex.
It's about taking it back.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.274
Fair enough.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.369
I do that, too.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.999
I'm always picking up the things
people leave behind.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.003
This is your home.
It was your party.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.380
It is.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.176
I must admit that I find cupcake
to be an interesting concept,

05:42.176 --> 05:43.969
but I don't understand it.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.722
You don't have sex at
the end of the evening.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.057
So what do you do?

05:48.516 --> 05:51.018
Don't you think that there's something ...

05:52.144 --> 05:56.607
freeing about just stimulating your
senses and leaving it at that?

05:56.774 --> 05:59.151
Sure, that's possible.

05:59.151 --> 06:02.279
But when people get stimulated,
they get territorial.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.407
That's human nature.
And that can be dangerous.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.702
Your party have rules?

06:09.120 --> 06:12.248
That's the great thing
about cupcake.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.709
There are no rules.
Excuse me.

06:17.128 --> 06:18.254
Sure.

06:21.173 --> 06:24.593
So, let me get this straight--
everybody gets together for sex

06:24.593 --> 06:26.345
and then nobody has it.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.056
Everybody knows what
goes on at an orgy.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.643
I mean, you can add all kinds of
weird little party favors -

06:32.643 --> 06:34.812
... cupcakes, weird ingredients

06:34.812 --> 06:36.689
-- an orgy's an orgy.

06:36.689 --> 06:39.108
But Noel Peach was the
one that got screwed.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.735
We're going to
need you inside.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.238
In more ways than one.

06:49.368 --> 06:52.621
So, this is our first time.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.958
The two of us on a case. You know,
you usually work with Speed.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.501
Yeah, I guess I do.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.044
Well, he says you taught him a lot.

06:59.044 --> 06:59.962
Oh, yeah?

06:59.962 --> 07:01.839
All right, the couple that called it in...

07:01.839 --> 07:04.842
are Lisa and Mark Tupper.
Transplants from Boston.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.928
They said they were taking a
nap about seven miles out.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.639
Anyway, an unidentified male
climbed up their aft ladder,

07:10.639 --> 07:12.391
then promptly dropped dead.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.352
A guy comes out of the Atlantic,
chooses their boat to die on?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.812
That's their story.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.651
Well, single stab wound to the gut.

07:23.319 --> 07:25.112
Pallor indicates he bled out.

07:25.863 --> 07:29.325
So, uh, where's the
rest of the blood?

07:46.675 --> 07:49.553
There was a lot more blood
than what we're seeing.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.767
Let's process this boat for
any potential weapon.

08:20.876 --> 08:24.004
Got knives.
You find something?

08:24.547 --> 08:29.343
Yeah. I found traces of blood and
hair here on the end of this flashlight.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.304
Good work.
Let's get it to DNA.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.472
Okay, right away.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.765
Great.

08:37.852 --> 08:40.104
His heart simply stopped beating.

08:40.438 --> 08:43.691
Now how could that happen
to a perfectly healthy young man?

08:43.691 --> 08:46.360
Tox was negative for
the garden variety drugs.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.487
What about the white powder
you found on his mouth?

08:48.487 --> 08:51.449
Six percent conchiline,
92% aragonite.

08:51.449 --> 08:55.911
Good, old-fashioned, ground-up
pearl dust. Harmless.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.205
Could he have had an
allergic reaction to it?

08:58.205 --> 09:01.751
No rashes, no edema,
no airway congestion.

09:01.751 --> 09:04.754
Just the ligature mark you found and
a tiny  oval impression on his chest.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.630
Those certainly didn't kill him.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.424
So where does that leave us now?

09:08.424 --> 09:11.177
With an apparent death
of natural causes.

09:11.177 --> 09:14.722
I hate to say it, but we
could be done here.

09:15.639 --> 09:19.435
Alexx ... does the DNA suggest
that there's semen present?

09:19.435 --> 09:23.230
Yeah. Tails on the sperm indicate
sex just before death.

09:23.230 --> 09:27.401
And a vaginal contribution
that eluded the condom.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.696
But that's not why
you're here.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.156
No, it's not.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.074
You think one of the women did it,
don't you?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.534
I do.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.037
No such thing as free love.

09:38.037 --> 09:40.623
Consenting adults have at it ...

09:40.623 --> 09:44.794
but I can guarantee you our friend
Noel here didn't consent to this, did he?

09:48.255 --> 09:49.381
Hey.
Hey.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.469
These are swabs taken from
the knives on the cabin cruiser.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.012
No trace of blood.

09:55.012 --> 09:58.891
Detective Puig says that the rest of
the Tuppers' story was confirmed.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.477
The marina owner saw just
the two of them go out.

10:01.477 --> 10:03.604
So they could be telling the truth.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.273
They cleaned up the blood.
Why hide that?

10:06.273 --> 10:09.610
Well, people hide things.
Half the time without even thinking.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.362
What'd you get off the flashlight?

10:11.362 --> 10:15.116
Um ... hair.
Belonged to our dead swimmer.

10:15.116 --> 10:17.201
And the blood, we're still testing.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.745
The hair is enough.
Let's bring the Tuppers in.

10:21.831 --> 10:24.375
You know those things we
took from your boat, Mark?

10:25.418 --> 10:26.544
Yeah.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.672
You want to tell us
about the flashlight?

10:30.381 --> 10:34.552
It wasn't Mark. He didn't do anything.
He was asleep.

10:49.275 --> 10:51.360
I never meant to hurt him.

11:03.581 --> 11:05.249
We could charge her with assault.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.417
Your call.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.336
Did the wound to the head play
a part in the victim's death?

11:10.379 --> 11:11.797
I don't know yet.

11:12.298 --> 11:16.427
So I processed the mosquitoes, but they
were too dehydrated to extract any blood.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.763
So I asked myself:

11:18.763 --> 11:22.057
A bunch of dead, dried-out mosquitoes,
what's so strange about that?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.518
People swat and kill them
all the time, don't they.

11:24.518 --> 11:29.732
But these were pristine.
Not swatted, not smashed.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.445
Pristine like the victim.
Alive one moment ...

11:34.445 --> 11:36.071
Dead the next.

11:36.071 --> 11:40.993
So, if Noel did die of natural causes,

11:40.993 --> 11:42.870
what killed these mosquitoes?

11:42.870 --> 11:46.081
Exactly. And since
mosquitoes drink blood ...

11:46.081 --> 11:49.877
Something in the blood
must have killed them.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.588
You know what? Let's have
Alexx go over the body again.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.881
Looking for?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.966
Looking for something lethal.

12:00.638 --> 12:01.680
Ladies.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.184
According to the physical evidence,

12:05.184 --> 12:08.312
someone had sex with Noel
Peach just before he died.

12:08.646 --> 12:13.025
So, we want to get a DNA reference
swab from each of you, okay?

12:14.902 --> 12:18.239
Okay, if you guys could just
form a line right here.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.243
That's not necessary.

12:24.495 --> 12:25.746
It was me.

12:28.499 --> 12:32.628
I didn't kill Noel.
He was fine when I left him.

12:32.628 --> 12:35.631
About what, uh ...
time was that?

12:36.882 --> 12:40.761
Just before two. I went upstairs
to lay down for a minute --

12:40.761 --> 12:44.932
before I knew it, it was morning.
Please, you have to believe me.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.769
One more question ...

12:50.062 --> 12:54.483
what did you do with
the condom you used?

12:54.483 --> 12:56.610
I didn't use one.

12:57.653 --> 13:02.867
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, well,
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:03.534 --> 13:07.121
That's correct. You have
my number. If you have ...

13:07.121 --> 13:10.791
if you have any questions, please don't
hesitate to call me. Yes, ma'am.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.377
Next of kin?

13:14.420 --> 13:16.046
That was his mother.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.716
And she said that she'd spoken
to him three days ago.

13:18.716 --> 13:21.844
He told her that he had
declared a college major.

13:22.178 --> 13:23.387
Did she know what
else he was into?

13:23.387 --> 13:27.558
Well, only that he no longer
needed help with his tuition.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.853
I went back over Noel's body.
Found this.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.022
An injection site.

13:35.107 --> 13:39.361
But there was nothing in his medical records.
No diabetes, known allergies, nothing.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.949
Nothing that would require a daily injection.
And it's not track marks.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.868
No. If he was a druggy,
it was his first time.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.954
So we've got dead mosquitoes
that are telling us nothing ...

13:48.954 --> 13:53.751
And the body telling us everything.
One of the hardest crimes to solve.

13:53.751 --> 13:54.794
Poison.

14:04.335 --> 14:07.004
The three most
common poisons are ... ?

14:07.421 --> 14:10.007
Strychnine, but that's obvious.

14:10.007 --> 14:13.594
Leaves the body horribly contorted
with that gruesome grin.

14:13.594 --> 14:17.181
Arsenic-- causes hair loss,
makes the skin jaundiced.

14:17.181 --> 14:20.643
And cyanide has that
bitter almond smell.

14:20.643 --> 14:23.354
The tox tests were negative
for all three. So that leaves us ...

14:23.354 --> 14:24.688
The world.

14:24.688 --> 14:28.984
It leaves us the world because any element
can be poison. It's all about the dose.

14:28.984 --> 14:31.362
Yeah, water will kill you if
you drink enough of it.

14:31.362 --> 14:32.863
Yeah, you'd think it would be easy --

14:32.863 --> 14:35.449
just put his blood in the mass
spec and get a result.

14:35.449 --> 14:36.617
But it's not easy ...

14:36.617 --> 14:39.120
... because poison
dissipates in the body.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.873
It disperses. It changes.
It becomes metabolites.

14:42.873 --> 14:47.586
In short, looking for poison
is like looking for smoke.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.381
Here's what we're going to do.

14:50.381 --> 14:52.716
Alexx is going to take a
sample from the body.

14:52.716 --> 14:55.803
What we're looking for is
whatever was given to Noel...

14:55.803 --> 14:59.974
and who had a reason to give it to him.
This kid had a family.

15:01.892 --> 15:04.061
They deserve to know
what happened to him.

15:05.104 --> 15:09.275
Preliminary autopsy report says
the flashlight blow was a minor injury.

15:10.317 --> 15:15.114
Cause of death was from the blow to the liver,
causing massive internal bleeding.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.825
Any number of stabbing
implements could've caused it,

15:17.825 --> 15:21.537
but the interesting things
here are the organs.

15:21.537 --> 15:22.997
His spleen was contracted --

15:22.997 --> 15:27.793
about a twenty percent decrease in size from what
you'd normally find in a male his size and age,

15:27.793 --> 15:32.047
but his heart and lungs were
twenty percent larger than normal.

15:32.256 --> 15:36.093
So, we've got a guy with
big lungs and a big heart.

15:36.093 --> 15:40.347
Could be an athlete.
But the spleen, is that it?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.058
Would I do that to you?

15:44.602 --> 15:48.772
Swabbed his wound.
Found some kind of microorganism.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.025
Really?

15:57.573 --> 16:01.243
O-kay, folks,
let's crash their party.

17:46.056 --> 17:47.308
Hello.

17:49.685 --> 17:53.564
Microorganisms in our swimmer's
wound are spores. Barrel sponge.

17:53.564 --> 17:55.900
Bravo, Alexx.
Hmm ... take a look.

17:58.694 --> 18:00.654
Aren't those found
in deep water?

18:00.654 --> 18:03.741
Over fifty feet down below the,
uh, sun canopy.

18:03.741 --> 18:05.367
How's that possible?

18:05.367 --> 18:08.954
No excess nitrogen in our swimmer's system.
He wasn't using compressed air.

18:08.954 --> 18:11.040
You said he had an enlarged
heart and lungs, right?

18:11.040 --> 18:12.792
And contracted spleen.

18:13.125 --> 18:17.838
I'm thinking he was a free diver. They're purists.
They dive without air tanks.

18:18.172 --> 18:21.509
Record's a hair over seven minutes.
They train like crazy --

18:21.509 --> 18:25.679
um, condition their lungs. They hyperventilate
to shut off the breathing center.

18:30.351 --> 18:33.145
For most people, thirty seconds and
your brain's screaming, "breathe!"

18:33.145 --> 18:35.981
I heard about this one contest
where they had one heart attack

18:35.981 --> 18:39.318
and forty shallow-water
blackouts caused by hypoxia.

18:39.318 --> 18:44.156
It's, uh, oxygen starvation -- makes
you delusional, tricks the brain.

18:44.156 --> 18:48.536
Sounds crazy ... but it does explain the
size of our swimmer's lungs and heart.

18:48.536 --> 18:52.706
And the compressed spleen.
Pressure makes the organs contract.

18:55.584 --> 18:59.755
It allows the body to squeeze the last
drop of oxygen out of the blood.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.466
Someone in homicide...

19:02.466 --> 19:06.637
told me that there was a contest out of
Crandon Marina really early this morning.

19:06.637 --> 19:07.555
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:07.555 --> 19:08.764
You got directions?

19:08.764 --> 19:10.850
And a full tank of gas.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.314
Excuse me,

19:17.314 --> 19:21.819
is there someone we could talk to about
a diving contest out here this morning?

19:22.027 --> 19:23.904
Yeah. Who are you?

19:23.904 --> 19:25.448
Detective Puig.

19:25.448 --> 19:27.992
Donner, Delko,
Miami Crime Lab.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.577
Okay, you're here about Adam?

19:30.202 --> 19:33.330
Adam?
Carson ... cops are here.

19:38.419 --> 19:39.253
Have you found him?

19:40.087 --> 19:41.130
Who?

19:41.130 --> 19:44.717
My brother Adam.
That's why you're here, right?

19:45.050 --> 19:46.927
Your brother's missing?

19:46.927 --> 19:48.179
Since this morning.

19:48.179 --> 19:52.349
Called the coast guard. I filed a report.
Just tell me you found him.

19:55.186 --> 19:56.937
Um ... we may have bad news.

20:40.105 --> 20:43.484
Uh, there were maybe, uh,
fifteen people diving.

20:43.484 --> 20:44.443
We must've lost track.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.153
Yeah, but don't you guys
go down with a buddy?

20:48.239 --> 20:49.740
You don't know
what this is, do you?

20:49.740 --> 20:52.118
Free diving ain't
no team sport.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.078
It's just you and the big blue --

20:54.078 --> 20:58.874
no air, no life vest, no limits.
You're on the edge, on your own.

20:59.917 --> 21:03.504
Huge tuna.
Put up a hell of a fight.

21:03.504 --> 21:05.589
That must get the adrenaline
pumping, huh?

21:05.840 --> 21:08.759
It can.
Listen ...

21:08.759 --> 21:12.221
people were blacking out down there today,
staying down so long to look for Adam.

21:12.221 --> 21:14.849
Hypoxia can cause delusions, can't it?

21:14.849 --> 21:16.642
Not if you know your limits.

21:16.642 --> 21:20.396
That's the point, isn't it --
pushing past limits?

21:27.027 --> 21:28.779
What do you got there, Delko?

21:28.779 --> 21:30.573
Spear guns.

21:30.573 --> 21:34.452
I'll trade you some stale caviar for
some of those nifty spear guns.

21:34.452 --> 21:35.995
I hate fish eggs.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.956
Hey, Megan, did you miss me?

21:38.956 --> 21:41.375
She actually forgot your name.

21:41.375 --> 21:46.589
Two of us working together, we swabbed
every spear and knife from that competition,

21:47.173 --> 21:51.469
and on this one here we
found traces of human tissue.

21:51.469 --> 21:54.763
Spear gun belongs to Ignacio Paez,
our Cuban diver.

21:54.763 --> 21:59.351
So, we've got a murder
weapon and a suspect.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.603
What have you got?

22:02.146 --> 22:04.732
I have a murder weapon
of a different sort.

22:04.732 --> 22:07.776
The DNA results confirm
that they're Nikki Olson's.

22:07.776 --> 22:12.490
And inside the intimate part of her intimates,
a pubic hair from our victim, Noel Peach.

22:12.490 --> 22:16.660
And the impression on his
chest matches this bra clasp.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.508
An epi pen?

22:30.508 --> 22:33.969
Yeah, a spring-loaded injector
designed to treat allergies,

22:33.969 --> 22:36.430
and I found a print match
from one of our suspects on it --

22:36.430 --> 22:37.640
Nikki Olson.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.808
The blonde girl?

22:39.767 --> 22:42.561
They usually only contain a
single dose of epinephrine,

22:42.561 --> 22:44.230
but someonecould double-
or triple-load it.

22:44.230 --> 22:48.400
Yes, they could, and give old
Noel his last dance, huh?

23:06.033 --> 23:07.242
It's for bee stings.

23:08.535 --> 23:10.287
I'm allergic.
Arrest me.

23:10.996 --> 23:13.957
We didn't find any bee
stings on Noel Peach,

23:13.957 --> 23:17.377
but what we did find was a puncture
mark from that injector pen.

23:18.045 --> 23:20.130
Your pen, your prints.

23:22.925 --> 23:25.010
Feel free to jump in anytime.

23:26.136 --> 23:30.808
I never would have hurt Noel. And, frankly,
I don't know anyone who would.

23:30.808 --> 23:33.685
Well, the evidence says it's you.

23:35.771 --> 23:37.856
I thought he was going to die.

23:43.445 --> 23:45.823
You see, Noel
is allergic to shellfish.

23:45.823 --> 23:48.117
He didn't know those
were pearl shooters.

23:48.117 --> 23:50.828
Vodka and oyster juice
with pearl dust mixed in.

23:50.828 --> 23:52.371
It's supposed to be
an aphrodisiac.

23:52.371 --> 23:55.040
Well, that would explain the white
crystals around his mouth, but ...

23:55.040 --> 23:59.002
Okay, he had an allergic
reaction and you saved him.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.088
Was that before or
after you had sex?

24:01.088 --> 24:02.214
That's not what happened.

24:02.214 --> 24:05.467
We have a mark on Noel's
chest from your bra clasp and

24:05.467 --> 24:10.139
trace evidence of him inside your underwear.
And that didn't get there all by itself.

24:13.725 --> 24:15.310
I paid him, all right?

24:16.562 --> 24:18.147
It was a fantasy of mine.

24:32.119 --> 24:34.329
You ever strap on a
pair of four-inch heels?

24:35.706 --> 24:38.834
A pushup bra? Just to look
good for a man, right?

24:40.043 --> 24:42.546
I wanted to humiliate him like ...

24:45.174 --> 24:49.428
We dated. We had sex,
just not that night.

24:49.428 --> 24:52.681
He told me he was dating someone new,
that he was in love ...

24:55.517 --> 24:56.894
I was happy for him.

25:06.487 --> 25:07.905
Horatio?

25:07.905 --> 25:09.698
I just got off the phone with Alexx...

25:09.698 --> 25:12.993
and she said there was no more than
a single dose of epi in Noel's body.

25:12.993 --> 25:14.203
Probably not enough to kill him.

25:14.203 --> 25:16.246
Maybe he just had a
bad reaction to it?

25:16.246 --> 25:17.581
Do you believe her story?

25:17.581 --> 25:18.415
I don't know.

25:18.415 --> 25:21.168
I guess that depends on whether you like
seeing men dress up in your underwear or not.

25:21.168 --> 25:26.381
Personally, leather chaps, nothing else.
That was a joke.

25:26.632 --> 25:28.967
I know.
You know what we do?

25:28.967 --> 25:31.720
Let's round up the rest of the evidence
from the party and get it to trace.

25:31.720 --> 25:32.763
Back to square one?

25:32.763 --> 25:34.848
Back to square one.

25:40.896 --> 25:46.110
Mr. Paez, we found human
tissue on your spear gun.

25:46.276 --> 25:48.946
Are you telling me you don't
know how it got there?

25:48.946 --> 25:50.531
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

25:51.073 --> 25:53.659
Maybe it was an accident?

25:53.659 --> 25:56.286
A misfire, could have been
faulty equipment... ?

25:58.831 --> 25:59.873
Mr. Paez ...

26:01.166 --> 26:04.795
can I ask you a question?
Mr. Paez!

26:07.214 --> 26:08.590
What do you want?

26:09.007 --> 26:12.136
I'd like to run a test on you.
With your consent, of course.

26:18.308 --> 26:19.685
What is that thing?

26:19.685 --> 26:23.772
Tympanometer. It measures the middle ear's
response to waves of sound and pressure.

26:23.981 --> 26:25.441
It's a flat graph.

26:25.983 --> 26:27.359
Barotrauma.

26:27.776 --> 26:28.736
In english, please?

26:28.736 --> 26:32.406
His eardrums are ruptured.

26:32.406 --> 26:35.743
You're losing your hearing,
aren't you, Mr. Paez?

26:35.743 --> 26:37.870
You've been losing it for a while.

26:37.870 --> 26:41.665
Yeah, it's caused by intense pressure
from repeated dives to depth.

26:41.665 --> 26:46.879
Now, the air pressure in the inner ear has to be
equalized via valsalva or frenzel maneuvers.

26:47.463 --> 26:51.175
The water creates pressure when it
tries to push in from the outside,

26:51.175 --> 26:55.012
and if you don't equalize that
pressure on the way down, well ...

26:55.012 --> 26:56.972
... pop goes the weasel.

26:57.264 --> 26:59.308
Megan, can I talk
to you a minute?

27:02.436 --> 27:05.397
Okay, so he can't hear.
He still could have killed our vic.

27:05.397 --> 27:07.900
Not under fifty feet of water.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.028
That's the only place he could have
picked up those sponge spores.

27:13.697 --> 27:18.702
At that depth, water pressure would
have blown out Paez's inner ear.

27:18.702 --> 27:21.830
Put him in the hospital.
He didn't do it.

27:55.656 --> 27:59.159
Champagne and cocktails came
back negative for contaminates.

27:59.159 --> 28:00.661
Our poison is still a no-show.

28:00.661 --> 28:02.287
But did we find anything?

28:02.287 --> 28:06.125
There were traces of milled calcium
sulphate on the condom wrapper.

28:07.167 --> 28:08.419
Chalk?

28:08.419 --> 28:10.921
It might lead us to somebody
else who had sex with Noel.

28:10.921 --> 28:14.049
So, we are looking for someone
who is around chalk all the time.

28:14.049 --> 28:15.634
What did the guest book say?

28:15.634 --> 28:20.222
DMV helped me out with this:
Sophia Ananova, 24 years old.

28:20.222 --> 28:21.890
Take a guess what she
does for a living?

28:21.890 --> 28:25.144
Myrtle Shores Day School.
Third grade.

29:13.734 --> 29:14.860
Hey.

29:15.569 --> 29:18.989
We've got a problem.
No DNA match to our swimmer.

29:19.948 --> 29:22.242
But there were human
skin cells on that spear.

29:22.242 --> 29:26.705
Not from our victim Adam Cassidy.
I did a full run.

29:26.705 --> 29:31.043
Profiler Plus and coFiler.
We don't have the murder weapon.

29:31.043 --> 29:34.588
We ran tests on all of the blades and
all of the spear points from that boat.

29:34.588 --> 29:37.216
Well, we're missing one.
Maybe it's at the crime scene.

29:37.216 --> 29:39.343
And fifty feet of water.

29:39.343 --> 29:41.428
Or somebody's hiding something.

29:42.471 --> 29:46.016
Speaking of which, um,
at the marina I hid something.

29:47.101 --> 29:49.895
When I was processing
the flashlight, I sneezed.

29:49.895 --> 29:52.314
You contaminated evidence?
Why didn't you tell me?

29:52.314 --> 29:55.067
I wanted to,
I just didn't know how.

29:56.110 --> 29:58.737
Okay, Eric, we all make mistakes.

29:58.737 --> 30:03.117
What's important is we don't make them
very often, and we never withhold information.

30:04.701 --> 30:05.744
I messed up.

30:06.036 --> 30:07.621
Don't let it happen again.

30:07.704 --> 30:08.956
I won't.

30:08.956 --> 30:12.376
Good. 'Cause I'd hate to lose
the only CSI in Miami ...

30:12.376 --> 30:15.504
who can process a crime
scene in fifty feet of water.

30:47.578 --> 30:48.746
Great.

30:49.788 --> 30:52.958
I know we've talked to you once,
but we need to follow up.

30:52.958 --> 30:56.754
God, I can't believe this.
I'm going to lose my job.

30:56.754 --> 31:00.758
What you do on your own
time is your business.

31:01.091 --> 31:02.384
Well, I appreciate that.

31:03.135 --> 31:06.555
But when you commit a crime
it becomes our business.

31:12.978 --> 31:16.899
Can we hurry this up a little?
I'm got later gators in five minutes.

31:16.899 --> 31:19.151
Horatio ... look.

31:20.194 --> 31:23.947
It's the same brand.
Looks like a match.

31:23.947 --> 31:25.157
It is a match.

31:26.075 --> 31:28.410
I try to be safe.
Is that a crime?

31:28.410 --> 31:30.412
No, not a crime.

31:31.038 --> 31:32.414
But murder is.

31:43.824 --> 31:46.118
I didn't have sex with that man.

31:46.118 --> 31:48.829
Listen, we've all been there.

31:48.829 --> 31:54.084
The morning after you wish you
hadn't. Just doesn't make it so.

31:54.084 --> 31:56.003
I'm telling you the truth.

31:58.297 --> 32:02.050
That condom was yours.
It was in your bag.

32:03.719 --> 32:04.803
I know.

32:05.345 --> 32:07.222
It was exciting, wasn't it?

32:10.642 --> 32:12.936
To be ...

32:12.936 --> 32:17.316
that intimate with
someone you hardly knew.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.448
You changed your mind.

32:24.865 --> 32:27.951
It wasn't like that.

32:27.951 --> 32:30.037
I mean, I fantasized about it, sure ...

32:31.246 --> 32:34.041
but I would never actually
have sex with a stranger.

32:34.124 --> 32:35.500
Do you smoke?

32:37.586 --> 32:41.923
Yeah. Well, I mean, I did.
I've been trying to quit.

32:42.549 --> 32:43.925
Good luck with that.

32:49.723 --> 32:51.058
Nicotine patches?

32:51.683 --> 32:56.855
Nicotine is actually one of the
most toxic of all poisons --

32:56.855 --> 33:00.067
more lethal than cyanide or
cobra venom, believe it or not.

33:00.067 --> 33:04.363
Yeah, but seven to 22 milligrams per nicotine
patch is not enough to kill someone.

33:04.363 --> 33:08.742
But 50 milligrams is. That's only three or
four of those patches right there.

33:09.785 --> 33:14.998
First you get seizures as the nicotine
moves through the central nervous system.

33:15.082 --> 33:19.670
Followed by paralysis. The lungs collapse,
the heart stops beating.

33:20.087 --> 33:22.089
It can happen in five minutes.

33:23.298 --> 33:24.925
Did Alexx do a
second tox screen?

33:24.925 --> 33:28.720
Alkaloid salts came back positive.
Traces of cotinine metabolites.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.389
Noel peach died of
nicotine poisoning.

33:30.389 --> 33:32.599
Okay, but then how was
the poison introduced?

33:32.599 --> 33:36.269
It wasn't inhaled, the dosage would have
been too small, and it wasn't ingested,

33:36.269 --> 33:37.562
he would have tasted it, right?

33:37.562 --> 33:40.190
Trans-dermal absorption.
She stuck a couple of patches on him.

33:40.190 --> 33:42.109
We found no adhesive residue.

33:42.109 --> 33:45.988
She could have worn gloves , maybe applied
liquid concentrate directly to the skin.

33:45.988 --> 33:49.116
We're not making this case.
Let's go back to the body.

33:53.745 --> 33:54.788
H-5.

34:02.379 --> 34:03.422
H-6.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.601
Well, here it is.

34:18.978 --> 34:23.775
The exposure site is
between K-6 and L-6.

34:26.987 --> 34:28.155
Oh, my.

34:28.155 --> 34:32.784
Confirmation. Nicotine was introduced
through the penile tissue.

34:32.784 --> 34:35.579
It gives a whole new meaning
to the term "members only."

34:37.039 --> 34:38.706
Yes, it does.

34:57.016 --> 35:01.229
Guess who won the 1998
Blue Water Meet.

35:01.229 --> 35:04.900
Carson Cassidy.
Adam's won it every year since.

35:04.900 --> 35:10.113
Huh. Well, this knife belongs to Carson,
but we can't prove it killed his brother.

35:10.739 --> 35:12.032
The test for blood was negative?

35:12.032 --> 35:16.411
Inconclusive, as were the
matches to the wound track.

35:17.496 --> 35:20.624
You know, I used to have this
summer job scraping boat hulls.

35:21.583 --> 35:25.212
A lot of bilge contaminants in the water.
I used to have to clean my knife every night.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.967
Blood might have gotten
inside the handle.

35:43.772 --> 35:45.232
His brother's keeper.

35:51.154 --> 35:53.657
Sevilla is ready to file the arrest
warrant on the teacher.

35:53.657 --> 35:56.660
Tell her to hang on a
minute, will you?

35:56.660 --> 35:58.578
For what?
We got her.

35:58.578 --> 35:59.705
Do we?

35:59.705 --> 36:01.999
Well, she had the nicotine
patches and the condoms.

36:02.666 --> 36:05.210
The problem is, is that
the box of patches is full.

36:05.210 --> 36:06.378
She bought a new box.

36:06.378 --> 36:08.505
But distillation takes time.

36:08.505 --> 36:10.465
So where did the nicotine
come from?

36:10.465 --> 36:14.344
That flower bed was filled
with roses, wasn't it?

36:14.344 --> 36:16.847
And crawling all over
those roses are what?

36:20.559 --> 36:21.685
Aphids.

36:21.685 --> 36:24.688
How do you get rid of a
pest like an aphid?

36:24.688 --> 36:26.898
Insecticide.
Nicotine is an insecticide.

36:26.898 --> 36:30.027
One of the oldest known to man.
It's been in use since the mid-1800s.

36:30.027 --> 36:32.112
And that would explain
our dead mosquitoes.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.580
Have we processed that garden yet?

36:41.580 --> 36:44.374
We went through the
patio and the toolshed.

36:44.374 --> 36:46.752
I don't recall seeing any
heavy-duty insecticide.

36:46.752 --> 36:48.629
Have we talked to the gardener?

36:49.671 --> 36:52.007
Yeah, I keep the insecticides
locked in my truck.

36:52.007 --> 36:53.467
Some of that stuff
is dangerous.

36:53.759 --> 36:57.220
Red kill. Forty percent
nicotine sulfide solution.

36:57.220 --> 36:58.388
Oh, really?

36:58.388 --> 37:00.474
I could have
sworn I locked that.

37:05.145 --> 37:10.359
Oh, yeah, we got a couple of prints.
Off to the lab they go.

37:12.361 --> 37:14.404
Adam must have
borrowed that knife.

37:14.404 --> 37:17.449
We already know he
borrowed a spear gun.

37:17.449 --> 37:20.994
Look, you've got no witnesses.
You've got no case.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.622
Would you mind
taking off your shirt?

37:36.635 --> 37:39.429
There ... are your witnesses,

37:39.429 --> 37:43.308
hundreds of them from a
deep-water barrel sponge.

37:49.940 --> 37:53.735
You and Adam were
down at least fifty feet.

37:53.735 --> 37:55.278
It took about two
minutes to get there.

37:55.278 --> 37:58.490
You must have already have
been entering that hypoxic state.

38:24.975 --> 38:30.188
So Adam shoots you with a spear gun.
I don't think he was aiming for you.

38:30.939 --> 38:34.818
You were both oxygen starved,
running on adrenaline.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.684
It was like a dream.

39:07.684 --> 39:09.478
Like ...

39:09.478 --> 39:10.729
my hand wasn't my hand.

39:10.729 --> 39:14.775
That would be the hypoxia talking.
You were delusional.

39:14.775 --> 39:16.234
That's not supposed to happen.

39:17.486 --> 39:19.446
Free diving makes everything clear.

39:20.739 --> 39:23.241
It's a trip down to primal instinct.

39:23.492 --> 39:27.663
Killing your own brother --
doesn't get more primal than that.

39:33.335 --> 39:36.546
I already told you Noel danced
for a lot of girls that night.

39:36.546 --> 39:38.507
A lot of girls wanted him.

39:38.674 --> 39:40.092
Enough to kill him?

39:43.095 --> 39:44.137
Here we go.

39:48.475 --> 39:49.726
What's that?

39:50.560 --> 39:54.189
These are Noel's phone
records for the last month.

39:54.189 --> 39:59.403
He called here over 107 times.
And most of those calls ...

40:00.237 --> 40:01.780
were less than a
minute in length.

40:04.491 --> 40:05.909
Why would he do that?

40:06.535 --> 40:09.037
Well, Nikki mentioned to me...

40:09.037 --> 40:13.750
that he was seeing someone new,
and based on those records,

40:13.750 --> 40:14.793
I think it's you.

40:15.627 --> 40:17.963
But you weren't the one
who wanted him.

40:17.963 --> 40:19.423
It was the other way around.

40:19.548 --> 40:22.759
Noel was obsessed with you.

40:22.759 --> 40:26.930
He pursued you, even tried to make
you jealous by going off with Nikki.

40:28.056 --> 40:32.102
He wouldn't end it, so you
decided to end it for him.

40:33.145 --> 40:38.317
You took the condom out of Sophia's bag.
Added nicotine and insecticide.

40:38.317 --> 40:41.987
We found your fingerprints on
the bottle in your gardener's truck.

40:41.987 --> 40:46.700
And after the party, you let
Noel come to you one last time.

40:47.617 --> 40:49.703
You knew he couldn't resist.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.544
Poisoners are like kids
with their homework.

40:57.544 --> 40:59.630
They want to show the math.

41:03.508 --> 41:04.426
What are they doing?

41:04.426 --> 41:08.055
The other day, while you out there
with Detective Sevilla ...

41:11.767 --> 41:14.936
You inadvertently provided me
with the smoking gun.

41:15.771 --> 41:16.813
Horatio.

41:24.404 --> 41:29.618
See, I'm guessing that inside
that thing will be nicotine,

41:29.660 --> 41:34.414
and on the outside will be
your epithelial cells.

41:34.414 --> 41:35.874
You could have poisoned yourself.

41:36.249 --> 41:38.335
Well, that's why they
call it "safe sex."

41:39.044 --> 41:40.253
Not for Noel.

41:42.047 --> 41:43.090
He didn't understand.

41:43.090 --> 41:44.216
He was in love with you.

41:44.216 --> 41:45.258
So what?

41:47.594 --> 41:50.722
Why is it always about
what the man wants?

41:51.848 --> 41:55.519
His decision ...
his orgasm ...

41:55.519 --> 41:56.979
his rules.

41:57.813 --> 42:02.275
So, you killed Noel ...

42:02.275 --> 42:05.404
because he wouldn't play by your rules.
Is that what you're telling me?

42:07.280 --> 42:09.199
At least he gave me a
new kind of thrill.

42:11.284 --> 42:12.327
Well ...

42:13.578 --> 42:14.913
I hope you enjoyed it ...

42:17.207 --> 42:18.792
because it's going to be your last.

42:36.310 --> 42:37.602
You going to release the body?

42:38.645 --> 42:40.731
Yeah. His mother's here.

42:44.067 --> 42:46.361
Just have to sign
the death certificate.

42:48.447 --> 42:50.991
Not the kind of diploma
he was after, though, huh?

42:51.616 --> 42:53.201
Not the kind you frame.

43:00.417 --> 43:01.627
You okay?

43:05.464 --> 43:07.382
You need a couple more minutes?

43:08.008 --> 43:10.093
No, but he did.
