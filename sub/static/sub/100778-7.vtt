[Archie] <i>Hmm.</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:48.548
Ace was a good man.
It's okay to be sad, Jack.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.384
I'm not talking about Ace,
I'm talking about our movie.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.594
I'm talking about <i>Meg.</i>

00:53.303 --> 00:55.013
Destroying a print, it's a sin.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.973
It's like--
it's like burning <i>The Mona Lisa.</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:58.725
Can we not talk about that, please?

00:58.808 --> 00:59.893
It's over. It's all over.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.812
Nah, hold on, hold on.
Avis is running the studio now.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.148
You know,
she fired the lawyers that did it.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.233
This was her passion project.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.153
I just think we should talk to her,
you know?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.197
Tell her we're going to reshoot
the whole thing.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.074
Half a million dollars
just went up in smoke.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.743
Now we're going to go back
and ask for the same amount again?

01:16.826 --> 01:17.827
Never gonna happen.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.331
Look, it was an honor
working with you fellas.

01:21.831 --> 01:22.957
I'm proud of you.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.086
[Jack] So long, fellas.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.670
See you, Jack.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.922
-See you around.
-Archie.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.424
[Harry] Raymond!

01:33.176 --> 01:34.010
Ray!

01:34.761 --> 01:35.595
Harry!

01:35.678 --> 01:37.097
Come on, walk with me.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.224
I wanted to tell you something.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.519
You remember me bragging about
giving it to...

01:43.103 --> 01:44.354
Gloria Swanson?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.189
That was way out of line.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.274
Joe Kennedy had just dumped her.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.194
We never really shtupped anyway.

01:51.319 --> 01:55.698
-It was just, uh, straight-up cunnilingus.
-Is that what you wanted to tell me?

01:55.782 --> 01:57.784
No, I gotta ask you a question.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.995
Avis is now in full control
of the studio, right?

02:01.079 --> 02:02.747
-Yeah.
-Good.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.755
When thatÂ slimy piece of garbage,
Henry Willson,

02:10.839 --> 02:12.340
started fucking with your film,

02:13.216 --> 02:16.719
I knew I had to make
a copy of your cut for safekeeping.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.722
I did the same thing for <i>Wizard of Oz,</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:23.434
when some idiot producer wanted to cut
<i>Somewhere Over the Rainbow,</i>

02:23.518 --> 02:24.602
if you could believe it.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.064
I made a print, took it home,
it stayed in the picture.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.694
That's your movie, kid.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.821
You know what this means, don't you?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.489
You're still in the game.

-[Avis laughing] Oh!

03:38.509 --> 03:41.471
You don't think that this
is just a bit premature?

03:41.554 --> 03:43.598
Dick, why can't I have a little fun?

03:43.681 --> 03:45.934
Our passion project is back from the dead.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.978
I fired every one of those lawyers
who stood in my way.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.104
A toast!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.566
Here's to my late husband,

03:54.192 --> 03:57.320
who, in the end, loved what we did.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.740
-To Ace.
-[all] To Ace.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.161
Right, let's get to it.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.706
What's the plan?
How do we release this picture?

04:08.831 --> 04:10.708
Well, there's been a lot of hand-wringing

04:10.792 --> 04:13.503
how this film will be received
in the South.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.463
A lot of theaters there said
they won't run it,

04:15.546 --> 04:17.298
but some major cities will,

04:17.382 --> 04:21.177
and I've promised to cover the cost of
security to keep those theaters open.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.388
It's a cost that I think
that we can recoup

04:23.471 --> 04:26.349
with a larger-than-usual
nationwide release.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.559
-How many theaters?
-[Ellen chuckles]

04:28.643 --> 04:30.561
Six hundred and seventy-five.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.063
Has that ever been done?

04:32.146 --> 04:33.940
No, it has never been done.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.859
I'm calling it a "wide release."

04:36.943 --> 04:40.571
A print of this picture will be sent
to every theater in this country.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.908
We're also going to lower ticket prices
by five cents.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.786
It will fill all those seats with people

04:46.869 --> 04:49.247
who maybe haven't seen
a movie for a while.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.873
Perhaps never seen one.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.793
You're gonna have a lot
of poor colored folks

04:53.876 --> 04:56.004
moving heaven and earth
to come see this movie.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.089
Exactly. It's going to be expensive...

04:58.172 --> 05:00.883
But it's going to be a story
in and of itself.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.012
There won't be a single man,
woman, or child in America

05:04.095 --> 05:05.972
who doesn't hear about this.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.099
It's going to be a national conversation.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.102
I, for one, think that's a good bet.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.813
Let's do it. What's next?

05:14.230 --> 05:16.691
Well, I just spoke to my dear friend
Hedda Hopper,

05:16.774 --> 05:19.068
and I told her that last night
in Pasadena,

05:19.152 --> 05:24.657
<i>Meg</i> reported the highest test score
in Ace Pictures history.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.160
Now, now, Miss Kincaid,
that wouldn't happen to be

05:27.243 --> 05:28.494
a little white lie, would it?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.955
Well, it was an enormous white lie,
and I'm quite proud of it.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.332
[all laughing]

05:32.415 --> 05:36.210
How about this idea? I announce that
I'm green-lighting another picture

05:36.294 --> 05:37.754
by Raymond Ainsley,

05:37.837 --> 05:40.882
written by Archie Coleman,
starring Camille Washington!

05:41.424 --> 05:42.300
You have another idea?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.303
-Yes--
-Sold, I'll announce it today.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.721
This is exciting!

05:46.804 --> 05:49.182
-I think another toast is in order.
-[Raymond] I'll say.

05:49.265 --> 05:53.686
In two weeks, either we'll all be looked
at as the smartest people in Hollywood,

05:54.437 --> 05:56.314
or we'll never work again.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.776
To never working again.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.944
-[all] To never working again!
-[clinking]

06:02.028 --> 06:04.030
[music playing]

06:08.159 --> 06:09.285
Hey, baby doll!

06:10.119 --> 06:12.413
Get in here. Come feed me.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.916
I ain't talking about pancakes.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.878
-You think my hair just does this?
-[chuckles]

06:18.961 --> 06:20.630
Here's what we're going to do.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.758
I am going to whip up
a couple of pot pies,

06:24.342 --> 06:26.177
and we're gonna go to the picture show,

06:26.260 --> 06:29.472
and then when we come back,
we're going to wreck this bed again.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.557
-Ah.
-That's my idea of a Sunday.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.351
Sounds like a plan!

06:35.186 --> 06:37.730
-What are you looking at?
-I got to tell you, kid...

06:38.648 --> 06:42.193
I've been with a lot of women in my time.
I mean a <i>lot.</i>

06:42.276 --> 06:44.070
You got a point you're going to get to?

06:44.153 --> 06:46.489
But I can't say, other than my late wife,

06:46.823 --> 06:50.076
God rest her soul,
that I had feelings for any of them.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.702
Except you.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.373
I'm not sure I know what to say.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.834
Then let me do the saying.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.586
I'm saying...

07:03.589 --> 07:04.757
I love you, kid.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.176
Oh, Ernie...

07:10.388 --> 07:11.597
Mmm.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.642
I have another plan.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.228
-Not pot pies. Cherry.
-Oh-ho-ho!

07:17.311 --> 07:19.397
After the movies,
we'll stop by House of Pies

07:19.480 --> 07:23.109
and get the biggest, grandest cherry pie,
and that's what we're gonna eat

07:23.192 --> 07:24.444
all day long.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.195
I'll just wear some heels and...

07:26.946 --> 07:29.615
maybe I'll slip on a fur coat
over this little thing.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.536
Then, when we're at the movies,
we can sneak in the men's room

07:33.619 --> 07:34.829
and have a quickie!

07:35.163 --> 07:36.122
-[coughing]
-[Ellen] Oh!

07:36.205 --> 07:38.791
I think I've even got a trench coat
for you to put on.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.089
Hey, Ellen, stop for a sec. Come here.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.138
-What?
-You're my gal now...

07:53.598 --> 07:54.599
wouldn't you say?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.767
Yeah, I'd say.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.269
Well, then...

07:59.145 --> 08:00.730
there's something you need to know.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.483
Something I ain't told nobody yet.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.027
This cough of mine...

08:06.819 --> 08:10.281
the one that kept blowing all those takes,
I've had it for years.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.992
I went to the doc last week.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.745
It's cancer.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.000
-I'm headed for the old dirt pile.
-[sighs]

08:23.294 --> 08:24.253
How long?

08:25.004 --> 08:25.922
Two months?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.382
Two years?

08:29.717 --> 08:32.345
So if you want me to throw on
my trousers and walk out that door,

08:32.428 --> 08:34.055
I'll do it, because at some point...

08:38.476 --> 08:40.811
At some point,
I'm going to be a real mess.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.147
No, we don't need to talk about this now.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.065
In fact...

08:46.234 --> 08:48.694
In fact, we don't need
to talk about it at all.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.696
You're my home, Ernie.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.491
And I'm not giving that up.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.246
Love came late to me...

09:00.331 --> 09:05.253
and I am going to enjoy
every single second of it.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.967
And you're sure, kid?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.052
I'm more than sure.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.263
[chuckling] I'm happy.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.682
I'm happier than
I've ever been in my life.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.185
I love you, Ernest West.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.895
I love you, kid.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.107
-I'm gonna go see about a coat.
-Hmm.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.277
I'm in the mood for pie.

09:31.070 --> 09:31.904
Me too.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.793
[Claire] What are you doing?

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
-Staring at you.
-Well, stop it.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.839
I can't. I can't stop staring at you.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.508
Let's go downstairs
and get some breakfast.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.302
Wait a minute,
I gotta tell you something.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.804
I shoulda told you a long time ago,
but I'm gonna tell you now,

09:56.887 --> 09:59.557
even though I think it's gonna mean
you'll never wanna see me again.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.642
When I was first working
at the gas station,

10:01.726 --> 10:05.229
-your mother came by, and she and I--
-I know you slept with her.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.856
-What?
-She told me.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.983
We've hated each other
for most of my life,

10:09.066 --> 10:11.944
but ever since she took over the studio,
we're as thick as thieves.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.989
Wait, so, are you okay with this?
Is she okay with us?

10:15.072 --> 10:16.157
Well, not at first.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.117
-I thought she was having a stroke.
-Yeah.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.744
Oh, and then she had a crying jag

10:19.827 --> 10:21.746
about how I was
sucking the life out of her.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.414
But, yeah,Â now she's fine.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.792
She thinks you and me as an item is
good PR for the movie.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.462
Are you okay? Do you not wanna...

10:29.545 --> 10:30.671
[phone rings]

10:30.796 --> 10:31.631
...be with me?

10:33.591 --> 10:34.675
[Avis screaming]

10:35.092 --> 10:35.926
Mother?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.346
-Oh, God.
-Mother?

10:38.429 --> 10:39.847
Oh, God, she knows I'm here.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.271
Mother?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.190
What happened? Are you all right?

10:49.690 --> 10:53.069
I just got off the phone with Dick.
The first receipts are in.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.114
Look, listen, um, we always knew...

10:57.657 --> 11:00.326
-that the odds... would be against us.
-Exactly.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.495
It doesn't matter what the movie makes,

11:02.578 --> 11:04.914
-it's about what the movie means.
-We broke all the records.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.582
-What?
-What?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.625
That's what I said.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.502
I told them that couldn't be right.

11:09.585 --> 11:13.589
But they double-checked the numbers.
We're the biggest hit in seven years.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.228
I could get used to it,
I'll tell you that.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.646
Well...

12:53.230 --> 12:56.150
I am so glad that we've made this
a regular thing.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.568
-Mmm.
-Without your advice,

12:57.651 --> 12:59.862
I don't know how
I would've gotten through the premiere

12:59.945 --> 13:01.906
and the press junkets--

13:01.989 --> 13:03.616
Oscar nominations
are coming out next week.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.034
Oh, they are? I didn't realize.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.619
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.539
[chuckles] I know you've been counting
the days off on that calendar.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.208
It's gonna be a tough year.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.127
You know,Â Rosalind Russell thinks
she got the thing in the bag,

13:15.211 --> 13:16.337
and I don't blame her.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.756
Murder, incest...

13:18.839 --> 13:21.050
I mean, they might as well have
just handed her the Oscar

13:21.133 --> 13:23.636
-and not even bothered to make the movie.
-[both chuckling]

13:24.261 --> 13:25.596
From what I hear...

13:26.013 --> 13:27.973
you got a really good shot.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.769
We'll see.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.853
So listen,

13:33.729 --> 13:35.356
if you get nominated,

13:35.439 --> 13:37.900
I want you to campaign hard.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.945
None of this shrinking violet bullshit.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.323
You will go to every opening,
you show up at every luncheon,

13:44.406 --> 13:45.658
and answer every question

13:45.741 --> 13:49.161
as if it was the most profound query
you have ever heard in your life.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.956
You got it? And don't let anybody
shame you for doing it.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.626
Now I took my lumps,
but I had to shut it all out.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.254
I'd worked my whole life so hard,

13:58.337 --> 14:02.633
and I knew I was going to have to work
really hard to do this.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.468
-[Camilla] Mm-hmm.
-To be the first.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.387
So I did.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.809
And do you know what happened
when I got to the ceremony?

14:12.643 --> 14:15.145
<i>The hotel had a "no colored" policy.</i>

14:15.229 --> 14:17.356
<i>They told me I could wait in the lobby,</i>

14:18.232 --> 14:20.568
<i>and if I won, somebody would come tell me,</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:22.403
<i>and then I could go in.</i>

14:22.695 --> 14:23.779
<i>And I backed down.</i>

14:25.406 --> 14:26.490
I said, "Okay,

14:27.241 --> 14:28.409
I'll wait out here."

14:30.369 --> 14:34.164
Somebody leaked that I was gonna win,
so just before they announced my name,

14:34.957 --> 14:37.543
they shuffled me in the back
and sat me in there.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.297
You best mind me, sister, 'cause
I'ma tell you right here, right now,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.173
when you go to that ceremony,

14:44.216 --> 14:46.260
you sit right down in that front row.

14:46.343 --> 14:50.472
You scream, you shout, you scratch
somebody's eyes out if you have to.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.600
But you demand the respect
that you're owed.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.020
It ain't about whether you win or lose.

14:56.604 --> 15:01.609
There's something more important at stake.
What's important... is being in the room.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.656
-I've been wanting to ask you something--
-We ain't got no secrets at this point.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.076
When you won...

15:12.328 --> 15:13.829
what did that feel like?

15:14.538 --> 15:15.789
I couldn't believe it.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.835
<i>I mean, I cried.</i>
<i>I got off that stage and I cried.</i>

15:20.377 --> 15:21.587
<i>I couldn't imagine it.</i>

15:23.047 --> 15:26.592
<i>I was the daughter of two slaves,</i>
<i>and here I was...</i>

15:28.719 --> 15:30.262
<i>with an Academy Award.</i>

15:32.181 --> 15:35.851
<i>I only played that role because my</i>
<i>grandmother worked on a plantation,</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:38.187
<i>and I knew who that woman was.</i>

15:38.562 --> 15:39.855
I knew Mammy.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.899
I did it in tribute.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.365
You know, I thought winning was gonna...

15:50.491 --> 15:51.700
change things for me.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.453
No more goddamn maids.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.081
Maybe I get to play
somebody romantic or...

15:57.748 --> 16:00.042
a comedy part.
You know, some funny, rich...

16:00.834 --> 16:03.170
lady in New York
with a feather in her cap.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.841
But... fucking no.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.302
The roles never came.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.722
It was like the town

16:14.223 --> 16:16.976
made me feel like I'd done something
wrong by winning...

16:17.935 --> 16:19.395
By walking across that

16:19.853 --> 16:21.689
all-white auditorium and...

16:22.314 --> 16:24.191
taking my place on that stage.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.946
No great roles ever came after that.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.532
And I never got back in that room.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.245
So you get in that room, and you own it.

16:38.747 --> 16:39.665
For me.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.377
For all of us.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.893
All my life, I thought I knew
the country I lived in,

17:40.976 --> 17:43.187
what it was always gonna be...

17:44.480 --> 17:45.647
but now...

17:46.774 --> 17:49.193
I feel like this ain't the place
I thought it was.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.404
Well, that's good, right?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.655
[chuckles softly]

17:55.115 --> 17:56.200
-Right?
-That's real good.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.701
-Yeah.
-That's real good.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.660

Mrs. Amberg will see you now.

[Archie] <i>Look, the reason</i>
<i>I'm here is because...</i>

18:25.938 --> 18:28.232
well, because I owe you
a great deal of respect.

18:29.441 --> 18:33.529
I'm grateful because I finally feel like
there's somebody in a position of power

18:33.612 --> 18:35.531
who is trying to understand me...

18:35.864 --> 18:39.034
being homosexual,
and a black man on top of that.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.787
I don't think it's so hard
to understand you.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.164
You and I are both outsiders.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.333
It's different, I know.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.961
I hardly know what it feels like
to walk in your shoes.

18:49.044 --> 18:49.878
Oh...

18:50.212 --> 18:52.172
That's the thing.
I don't think you could know.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.469
I still can't walk down the street
and hold hands with the man I love.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.098
Ace and I never held hands either.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.226
He had this habit
of walking ten feet ahead of me.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.811
But you could've held hands.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.983
Me, every time I step out my door,
I start lying to the world.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.317
It's weighing on me.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.902
I ain't gonna do it no more.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.655
[Archie sighs]

19:18.115 --> 19:19.366
I'm here to tell you,

19:19.950 --> 19:21.535
I'm going to do something.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.413
What are we talking about here, Archie?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.081
[Archie's breath shuddering]

19:27.374 --> 19:28.667
Rock Hudson...

19:30.127 --> 19:31.795
He's the man I'm in love with.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.382
We live together

19:36.216 --> 19:37.050
and...

19:40.637 --> 19:42.723
I'm showing up to the Oscars with him

19:43.515 --> 19:44.808
on my arm.

19:44.892 --> 19:48.604
He and I holding hands together,
getting photographed,

19:49.229 --> 19:52.441
telling the world we refuse to hide,

19:52.524 --> 19:54.860
and I know it may not seem
important to you,

19:55.944 --> 19:59.281
but opening up a newspaper
and seeing something like that, when...

19:59.364 --> 20:01.366
[voice breaking] ...when I was a boy...

20:02.951 --> 20:04.244
that I wasn't alone,

20:05.412 --> 20:10.792
that there were folks out there who had
the same thing going on inside...

20:14.129 --> 20:16.131
That would have made all the difference.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.177
Rock is an actor.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.931
He'll never work again.
He'll be throwing it all away.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.098
He knows that.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.141
And you, Archie?

20:26.225 --> 20:29.353
The retribution
will be swift and merciless.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.564
At best, protests, at worst,

20:33.148 --> 20:34.608
violence against you.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.401
I understand.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.697
Still, we're doing it.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.117
I just wanted to tell you.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.039
I'm sorry, MissÂ Amberg,
for putting you in this position.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.834
I know you'll be under some pressure
to release me from contract.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.588
But whatever you have to do, I understand.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.093

No, that's it for you. You're done.
It's over.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.930
-It's over for both of you.
-I don't care, Henry.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.307
Well, you're gonna care

23:14.101 --> 23:16.103

23:18.105 --> 23:20.941
-Go fuck yourself, Henry.
-What did you just say to me?

23:21.024 --> 23:22.442
I'm not gonna be like you,

23:23.026 --> 23:24.194

23:24.277 --> 23:27.447

to tell folks who they are...

23:27.739 --> 23:28.865

23:30.033 --> 23:32.369
You're fucking slime, Henry,
and that ain't news.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.621
Everybody knows it, and you know it.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.582

-Good evening.
-Hello.

24:18.498 --> 24:21.668
And if you'll follow me, Miss,
I'll show you where you'll be sitting.

24:22.085 --> 24:25.505
Sir, I prefer to sit in row A,
which is what it says on my ticket.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.175
It's not my decision, Miss.
It's the producers'.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.801
I'm just doing what I was told.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.511
Excuse me, what the hell is going on here?

24:31.595 --> 24:34.347
She's up for Best Actress.
You're letting her in that room.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.726
Thank you, but I don't need you to fight
my battles for me.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.979
Sir, I don't know what you've been told,
but I'm going to count to three

24:41.062 --> 24:44.191
then I'm going to walk into that ceremony
and take my seat in the front row.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.567
Now, if you don't let me in,

24:46.151 --> 24:48.320
I'm going to start yelling "fire"
in this theater,

24:48.653 --> 24:50.155
and there won't be a ceremony.

24:50.238 --> 24:54.117
So you think for a minute about what those
producers of yours are going to prefer.

24:56.203 --> 24:59.206
You do not want to fuck with me, sir.
I promise you that.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.840
Good luck tonight, Miss. I hope you win.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.175

being somebody doesn't mean a thing

30:54.978 --> 30:56.688
unless you're somebody to someone.

Thank you all so much.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.375
This is very humbling
for a kid from Altoona.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.460
[chuckles]

36:52.543 --> 36:54.962
When I was a little girl
walking down the street,

36:55.046 --> 36:57.131
I was called a lot of things.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.717
"Movie star" wasn't one of them.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.596
My daddy worked in the coal mines,
but every time he could spare a quarter,

37:03.679 --> 37:05.014
I'd escape to the movies.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.725
I loved looking up at that screen...

37:08.601 --> 37:09.644
and...

37:09.727 --> 37:13.189
I kept waiting to see someone show up
onscreen who looked like me.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.275
<i>A girl who was smart,</i>

37:16.984 --> 37:18.277
and strong,

37:19.278 --> 37:21.447
and glamorous. [chuckles softly]

37:23.282 --> 37:24.492
[chuckles]

37:24.951 --> 37:25.785
Thank you

37:26.452 --> 37:30.748
to the Academy for making sure that
no little girl staring up at that screen

37:31.707 --> 37:35.253
will ever again be told that there
are limits to what you can achieve.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.509
[all applauding]

37:44.720 --> 37:47.098
[orchestral music swells]

37:50.559 --> 37:51.978
Congratulations.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.897
[overlapping chatter]

37:55.398 --> 37:58.234
My God, you have no one
to thank but yourself.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.902
-No, thank you.
-You earned everything.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.112
So exciting!

38:02.780 --> 38:03.823
[clapping halts]

38:13.582 --> 38:15.668
They let me in the room this time.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.461
[chuckling]

38:21.841 --> 38:23.426
-Whoo!
-[both laughing]

38:23.509 --> 38:24.719
Mm-mm-mm.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.807
-[exhales] Whoo!
-[man] <i>The nominees for Best Picture are:</i>

38:29.890 --> 38:33.894
Avis Amberg and Henry Willson
with Ace Pictures for <i>Meg,</i>

38:34.854 --> 38:39.066
and Ronald Neame and Universal Studios
for <i>Great Expectations,</i>

38:39.775 --> 38:41.485
-and the winner...
<i>-</i>[drumroll]

38:42.153 --> 38:44.447
...for Best Motion Picture is...

38:44.530 --> 38:45.906
[suspenseful music playing]

38:50.911 --> 38:52.204
[man 1] Miss Amberg! Miss Amberg!

38:52.288 --> 38:54.540
[man 2] Mr. Ainsley,
how does it feel to win Best Director?

38:55.541 --> 38:57.460
Mr. Coleman, congratulations.

38:57.543 --> 39:00.838
-I'm a producer, it's my turn to hold it.
-I'm never letting you hold it.

39:00.921 --> 39:02.298
How does it feel, Avis?

39:02.715 --> 39:04.717
I'll tell you how it feels, Hedda.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.011
I say if you want something done,

39:07.845 --> 39:09.055
let a woman do it.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.056
Here, here.

39:10.723 --> 39:11.682
So true.

39:11.766 --> 39:12.767
[chuckles]

39:13.309 --> 39:15.311
[man] Miss Washington!Â Miss Washington!

39:15.895 --> 39:17.897
Archie. Archie, come here.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.361
I'm extending your contract five years,

39:23.444 --> 39:26.072
and doubling your salary.
Write whatever you want.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.449
You don't have to have to worry
about a thing.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.702
Not a thing.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.706
<i>âª I'm on the mellow sideÂ âª</i>

39:38.626 --> 39:39.752
[Henry] Hello, Rock.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.213
What do you want?
I didn't invite you to sit down.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.673
I know.
Listen, I get it, you're mad at me.

39:44.757 --> 39:45.758
I behaved badly.

39:46.258 --> 39:49.929
Not just with you, but with others,
and for a long time.

39:50.471 --> 39:53.391
Look, point is I am here to say I'm sorry

39:54.058 --> 39:55.309
for what I did to you.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.563
I mean, I also got you your start
in this town, but still I am sorry.

39:59.647 --> 40:00.564
I really am.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.483
I don't know whether you can...

40:03.651 --> 40:04.819
get over it or not.

40:05.444 --> 40:07.279
Yeah, Henry, I don't know if I can either.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.197
Okay.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.325
I've been sober for six months.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.787
I've been going to these men's meetings

40:15.788 --> 40:18.040
and not just about the booze, but about...

40:19.917 --> 40:20.751
you know...

40:23.087 --> 40:25.631
[sighs] About being like you and me.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.718
About how it ain't some...
perversion, you know?

40:30.136 --> 40:33.597
So I ain't got to act like I'm some kind
of degenerate, you know what I mean?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.516
And I met somebody.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.893
I've been seeing him for a while now,
so it's serious.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.855
Yeah, he's my age,
in case you were wondering.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.815
And I took a vow.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.692
I took, like, a solemn vow.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.194
Like, a get-on-my-knees vow,

40:47.778 --> 40:51.323
that I will never take advantage
of another person ever again, okay?

40:51.407 --> 40:52.283
I mean it.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.202
I'm asking you to forgive me.

40:57.246 --> 40:59.123
I'm begging you, as a matter of fact.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.587
I don't know if I can do that.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.090
Okay.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.595
-I still have nightmares about you, Henry.
-Okay.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.054
Okay?

41:17.266 --> 41:19.477
[weeping]
Thank you for saying all that, but...

41:21.520 --> 41:22.563
forgive you?

41:25.816 --> 41:27.776
I don't... I don't think I can.

41:27.860 --> 41:28.944
I understand.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.325
Thank you for hearing me out.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.460
I want to try and make it up to you.

41:46.378 --> 41:49.006
-Honestly, Henry, I don't--
-Wait, don't, Rock. Listen to me. Listen.

41:49.089 --> 41:53.219
Ever since you and Archie walked
the red carpet at the Oscars together,

41:53.302 --> 41:54.303
you've struggled.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.806
You haven't had any good parts, have you?

41:58.599 --> 42:01.393
I think folks knowing I'm queer,
that just means...

42:02.436 --> 42:04.939
there's only so many parts I can play,
you know?

42:05.022 --> 42:06.899
And with the death threats and all...

42:08.859 --> 42:10.945
[sniffles]
But I don't really care anymore.

42:12.154 --> 42:13.906
And I've gotten into bonsai lately.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.993
You know, those little Japanese trees?

42:18.077 --> 42:21.288
Well, you really take care of them,
you know, and it's meditative.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.791
Okay, fuck that. You listen to me.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.584
I am developing a movie.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.670
It's a love story between two men.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.340
It's gonna be the first homo love story
ever made.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.927
But not a porno, mind you,
this is a genuine love story.

42:35.010 --> 42:35.886
The lead role...

42:38.722 --> 42:40.140
The lead role is for you.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.393
Oh, Henry...

42:43.269 --> 42:45.104
They would never make a movie like that.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.146
Well...

42:46.730 --> 42:47.606
we'll see.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.483
[church bell tolling]

42:51.485 --> 42:52.861
[Jack] Changed my life...

42:52.987 --> 42:55.281
-more than anyone, I think.
-[Archie] The man was a legend.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.366
[Raymond] He stood up for all of us.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.797
Thanks to all of you for coming.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.383
Standing room only.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.970
So many familiar faces.

43:19.013 --> 43:23.392
That we're all here is a testament
to the person we're remembering today.

43:25.227 --> 43:27.187
His humor. His temper.

43:28.230 --> 43:29.773
His <i>joie de vivre.</i>

43:31.108 --> 43:32.776
Really, just one of the...

43:33.110 --> 43:36.864
funniest, most alive people you'd...

43:37.364 --> 43:39.408
ever have the pleasure to know.

43:40.117 --> 43:45.414
I think he thought that he could lick it
by sheer force of will.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.751
And by God, if anybody could,
it would have been him.

43:50.419 --> 43:53.130
But cancer won the day.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.343
Dick Samuels was a giant to me.

43:57.801 --> 44:02.806
I worked alongside him for 27 years,
so I think it's fair for me to say

44:03.682 --> 44:05.643
that he changed this town.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.478
Without DickÂ Samuels...

44:09.146 --> 44:11.482
you just don't have <i>Meg.</i>

44:12.232 --> 44:13.484
And since <i>Meg,</i>

44:14.443 --> 44:17.946
we have seen
the face of Hollywood change.

44:19.365 --> 44:21.367
Many of the films in production

44:21.450 --> 44:24.662
will star women and people of color.

44:25.037 --> 44:28.332
Without Dick Samuels,
this just doesn't happen.

44:29.083 --> 44:31.001
There's been a sea change,

44:31.418 --> 44:32.419
hasn't there?

44:32.878 --> 44:33.754
Finally.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.048
Thank you, Richard...

44:37.049 --> 44:37.966
for that

44:38.676 --> 44:40.511
and for all the rest.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.891
And now, I would like
to introduce John Banks,

44:45.974 --> 44:48.352
who was Richard's partner in life.

44:48.936 --> 44:51.188
He'd like to share a few words with us.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.023
Thank you. Thank you, John.

44:56.944 --> 44:57.861
[John] Thank you.

44:59.822 --> 45:00.989
On the night he died...

45:02.908 --> 45:05.077
it was one of the last things
he said to me...

45:07.246 --> 45:09.707
"I die an honest man."

45:10.916 --> 45:12.418
That's what we all hope for,

45:13.752 --> 45:16.380
to be able to say that
about the lives we've lived

45:17.339 --> 45:18.799
when our final day arrives.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.971
I think it gives us all something to...

45:25.431 --> 45:26.598
strive after,

45:27.558 --> 45:28.934
to hope for.

45:37.276 --> 45:40.320
Avis, can I have a word with you
for a moment?

45:41.947 --> 45:43.741
We have to do something, don't you think?

45:43.824 --> 45:44.742
About what?

45:45.284 --> 45:46.910
To memorialize Dick.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.454
What do you suggest?

45:51.790 --> 45:53.167
I want to make a picture.

45:53.834 --> 45:56.587
I want to make the first romantic movie
about two men.

45:57.671 --> 45:59.298
Two men who fall in love.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.259
And I want Archie Coleman to write it.

46:02.342 --> 46:04.344
I've already talked to Ray Ainsley
about directing,

46:04.428 --> 46:07.389
Jack Castello says he's on board,
and I want Rock Hudson to play the lead.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.016
What do you say?

46:10.100 --> 46:12.311
I am aware that there will be protests.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.022
-And death threats.
-Yes.

46:15.105 --> 46:16.231
But then I think,

46:17.608 --> 46:18.859
what would Dick say?

46:20.444 --> 46:21.487
What would he do?

46:23.447 --> 46:25.407
I think Dick would say, "Fuck them."

46:29.203 --> 46:30.078
Yes.

46:36.752 --> 46:37.753
Keep it under budget.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.089
Consider it green-lit.

46:50.015 --> 46:52.810
[Henry] Hey, what are these things
that look like big rubber bands?

46:52.893 --> 46:54.228
Those are fan belts.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.355
Connects the cooling fan
to the crankshaft.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.982
Don't tell me you never worked
on an engine before.

46:59.066 --> 47:01.985
Well, God, no.
I don't even know how to pop the hood.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.070
[Ernie chuckling]

47:03.153 --> 47:05.656
Hey, since the movie,
I see you're working all the time.

47:05.739 --> 47:08.116
-Mmm.
-[Henry] Great parts, too. Well done.

47:08.951 --> 47:09.827
I, um...

47:11.912 --> 47:13.497
I heard the station's for sale.

47:15.624 --> 47:16.458
Who told you that?

47:17.084 --> 47:18.335
Friends in high places.

47:19.336 --> 47:22.130
I also heard from a mouthy little bird

47:22.214 --> 47:25.092
that you're selling
'cause most days you don't feel so great,

47:25.175 --> 47:27.010
and I'm sorry for that, Ernie.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.428
I really am.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.265
[scoffs]

47:33.392 --> 47:34.268
Well...

47:35.018 --> 47:36.270
you're wrong about that.

47:36.728 --> 47:39.356
Really? Well, do tell, I'm all ears.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.693
I'm selling 'cause-- Actually, since <i>Meg,</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:46.113
with all the headlines, success
and scandal of Archie and Rock

47:46.196 --> 47:47.739
lip-locking on the red carpet,

47:48.448 --> 47:49.783
business is down...

47:50.617 --> 47:52.077
with the queer clientele.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.955
That's 75% of my business.

47:55.747 --> 47:57.666
Yeah, I've been feeling that
around town myself.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.877
I've even felt it a little,

47:59.960 --> 48:03.088
this refusal to accept shame any longer.

48:03.171 --> 48:05.883
You know, some guys, made out
of my kind of shoe leather,

48:05.966 --> 48:07.843
they've been pretty vocal about the fact

48:07.926 --> 48:10.053
that they're tired of skulking
in the shadows.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.764
I guess that Archie and Rock showed them
there's another path.

48:12.848 --> 48:13.891
[Ernie] Hmm.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.475
Well, it's a start.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.436
Yeah, sure.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.356
Holding a guy's hand in public,

48:21.815 --> 48:23.609
walking down the street, you know,

48:23.692 --> 48:25.694
you wait for a brick
in the back of the head.

48:26.653 --> 48:27.863
It doesn't come.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.991
Well, then, before you know it,
your guy wants to play house.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.660
Have you ever spent a Saturday

48:33.744 --> 48:37.789
picking out some cheerful,
daffodil-colored linoleum for the kitchen?

48:39.333 --> 48:40.334
I have, Ernie.

48:41.627 --> 48:45.005
And it is enough to make you wistful
for the days of secretive sodomy

48:45.088 --> 48:46.590
and late-night crocheting.

48:46.965 --> 48:49.134
[chuckling]

48:49.843 --> 48:50.844
I have a suggestion.

48:51.678 --> 48:52.554
[Ernie] Shoot.

48:53.347 --> 48:55.682
What do you say you and me go out back
to that old shed,

48:55.766 --> 48:57.267
you slap me around a little bit

48:57.351 --> 48:59.978
and shove that big pickle in my mouth
and call me Betty.
