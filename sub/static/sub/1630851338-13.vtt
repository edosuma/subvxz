00:02.469 --> 00:06.104
♪ ♪

00:51.385 --> 00:53.619
William,
we have to hurry.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.488
The lecture isn't
until one o'clock.

00:56.623 --> 00:59.024
Yes, but dr. Jones told me that
they're leaving for new york

00:59.093 --> 01:01.493
Almost immediately after.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.027
I want you
to meet him.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.298
- Dr. Jones?
- No! Dr. Freud.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.766
- Yes!
- I studied with him in vienna.

01:08.803 --> 01:11.036
Man with
strange theories.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.972
Yes. I'm very curious
to see what you think.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.043
Mr. Davidson?
How can I help you?

01:19.080 --> 01:21.113
I wish to report
a murder.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.448
- Of whom?
- My wife, lizzie.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.451
I believe someone
has killed her.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.919
You believe?

01:27.054 --> 01:28.987
I saw it in a dream
two nights ago.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.089
And I haven't
seen her since.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.526
Why don't you
have a seat?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.963
Man: No, please, you are not
listening. Please just listen.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.165
We have a conference.
We cannot--

01:40.234 --> 01:43.668
[overlapping shouting]

01:43.737 --> 01:45.971
You stopped.
I walked into you.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.706
I know this woman.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.209
- Dr. Freud!
- Dr. Ogden.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.011
We were just coming
to see your lecture.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.814
This is my husband,
detective william murdoch.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.383
Ah, yes!

02:00.554 --> 02:03.021
What brings you to
our station house?

02:03.023 --> 02:06.825
Uh, my colleagues and I are not
here out of desire, or intent.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.094
I detained them, sir.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.830
They were all participants in
a brawl at chez pierre.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.233
It was hardly a brawl.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.835
Their tables were overturned,
and people were screaming.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.436
Apparently, there was
some sort of death threat.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.572
Death threat?

02:20.608 --> 02:24.509
Ah, this was delivered
to me at my table.

02:30.050 --> 02:33.318
I'm afraid I don't
speak german.

02:33.453 --> 02:37.388
It reads, “use this to kill
yourself before I do.”

02:39.326 --> 02:42.661
It's most disturbing.
Why did it lead to a brawl?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.996
Because the only
people who knew

02:45.065 --> 02:48.133
I would be at the restaurant
were seated at my table.

02:48.268 --> 02:52.036
One of these men
wishes to kill me.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.014
My dreams? You think
this is about my dreams?

03:02.016 --> 03:03.615
What else am I
to think?

03:03.651 --> 03:05.350
You could start by not
making assumptions.

03:05.419 --> 03:09.154
Uh, find out how this letter
got to the restaurant.

03:09.289 --> 03:10.289
Sir.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.090
Dr. Freud does not need
you to speak for him.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.525
I will speak for dr. Freud--

03:13.527 --> 03:14.960
What's all this about?

03:15.095 --> 03:17.162
This is about
the subconscious expression

03:17.164 --> 03:19.831
Of displaced
oedipal rage.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.567
Jung: Are you referring to
my father now, or just to you?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.636
You assume this is about you?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.471
How am I to assume
anything otherwise?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.773
Enough!

03:27.908 --> 03:29.674
Sit down and shut up!

03:29.743 --> 03:32.411
Or you can all carry on
as much as you like in my cells.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.382
Can we not just spank
this lot and send 'em home?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.317
- Well, sir.
- What's this gibberish?

03:39.453 --> 03:43.855
It's german. It says, “use this
to kill yourself before I do.”

03:43.991 --> 03:46.925
Ogden: Apparently, one of
these men sent it to freud.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.127
Right. Interview them
one at a time.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.996
But keep them
away from me.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.364
Sir.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.802
William...

03:56.937 --> 03:59.204
Yes, julia, given your
experience in the field

03:59.206 --> 04:00.805
I should like you to help me
with the interviews.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.074
If you like.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.609
Yes! Uh, but...

04:04.645 --> 04:07.946
Well, when I was in
vienna, with dr. Freud,

04:07.948 --> 04:10.749
I participated in
his talking cure.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.686
And, well, much of the
talking

04:14.821 --> 04:16.087
Was about you.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.293
Oh. How nice.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.833
Yes.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.370
Dr. Ogden, what a pleasure
it is to see you again,

04:32.439 --> 04:35.740
Even if you did
challenge my theories.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.976
I'm flattered you remember.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.679
Ah, remembering is easy when
the experience is pleasant.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.649
Detective, as I recall,

04:44.718 --> 04:47.185
You lost your mother
at an early age.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.054
I did, yes.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.590
And you believed your father
to have killed her.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.527
Perhaps we should proceed
with the interview?

04:55.662 --> 04:56.728
Yes.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.130
Of course.
Please continue.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.665
[chuckles]

05:00.668 --> 05:02.267
Is there something?

05:02.269 --> 05:04.803
Oh, no. You are
merely conforming

05:04.872 --> 05:07.072
To my expectations
of you, detective.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.342
Oh! Ah, I see.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.778
And what expectations
would those be?

05:15.149 --> 05:18.050
You are a typical retentive.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.984
I'm retentive?

05:21.221 --> 05:24.622
Dr. Freud believes that
infantile development

05:24.658 --> 05:28.360
Is defined by pleasure-seeking
at distinct stages.

05:28.429 --> 05:32.664
If one cannot derive sufficient
satisfaction at any one stage,

05:32.733 --> 05:34.766
One becomes fixated.

05:35.769 --> 05:39.104
And what stage
would I be fixated at?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.605
The anal.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.643
It's a complex theory, william.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.847
Freud:Retentives are rigid.
Socially inhibited.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.982
They resist new ideas.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.718
You have an expression
in english, huh?

05:53.787 --> 05:58.390
Uh... A stick
in the... Ground, is it?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.058
Mud.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.793
Ah.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.661
I'm a stick
in the mud?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.530
Freud: Well, it is,
of course, complicated

06:05.566 --> 06:09.067
By an oedipus conflict
resulting in repression

06:09.202 --> 06:12.804
And unconscious feelings
of inferiority.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.408
Oedipus? You're referring to
the king who killed his father

06:16.410 --> 06:18.076
In order to
marry his mother?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.612
Perhaps we should get back
to the matter at hand.

06:20.681 --> 06:24.715
Ah, yes, yes. You wish to know
who sent the death threat.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.753
It was dr. Jung.
I'm certain of it.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.225
Dr. Freud is convinced I harbour
a death wish towards him.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.961
Every dream,
every conversation

06:36.997 --> 06:39.030
Is subject to this
interpretation.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.031
Why is that?

06:41.335 --> 06:44.236
He believes I have a displaced
oedipus conflict.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.271
Yes, what is this
oedipus conflict?

06:47.307 --> 06:50.175
A boy's sexual desire
for his mother

06:50.244 --> 06:52.710
Leads to conflict
with his father

06:52.780 --> 06:55.646
Who he fears wishes
to castrate him.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.517
So, he therefore wants to
kill his father

06:58.519 --> 07:00.718
And claim his
mother for himself.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.389
You think this
pertains to me?

07:04.524 --> 07:06.324
It pertains to all males.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.928
Ah, though dr. Freud places too
much emphasis

07:09.930 --> 07:12.530
On the sexual
dynamic.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.966
So, dr. Freud
feels this conflict

07:15.035 --> 07:16.902
Pertains to his
relationship with you?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.236
The parallels are obvious.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.141
I am the son, the heir apparent.
He is the father, the authority.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.810
It's a displaced conflict,
of course,

07:25.813 --> 07:30.148
But it presupposes a death wish
arising in the unconscious mind.

07:31.585 --> 07:35.620
This was clearly
a product of the ego.

07:35.656 --> 07:39.891
Dr. Freud's ego,
to be specific.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.560
Murdoch:
How so?

07:41.562 --> 07:43.995
I believe he sent
this to himself.

07:46.066 --> 07:50.302
When I realized what he
had done, I felt rage.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.171
Not at
the implicit accusation,

07:53.173 --> 07:57.075
But the rage of the son when
he discovers his father is weak.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.277
I am afraid I was cruel.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.513
In what way?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.448
I quipped
the only death wish

08:03.450 --> 08:06.617
He correctly
diagnosed was edie's.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.286
Who is edie?

08:08.322 --> 08:11.255
A patient of his
who committed suicide.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.124
Oh.

08:13.193 --> 08:17.395
I suppose I should have
expected a violent reaction.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.197
From dr. Freud?

08:19.332 --> 08:23.668
No. No, his defender
and imitator,

08:23.704 --> 08:26.137
Victor severn.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.274
I defended sigmund.
Someone had to.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.076
What did you do?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.811
I slapped jung's
silly swiss face,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.114
Sent his
eyeglasses flying.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.017
He looked so shocked,
I almost felt sorry for him.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.786
So, you believe dr. Jung
sent the death threats?

08:41.788 --> 08:46.157
Oh! Heavens, no.
That was dr. Ferenczi.

08:46.927 --> 08:47.992
Ogden:
Dr. Ferenczi?

08:48.028 --> 08:51.128
He was well aware
of sigmund's preoccupation.

08:52.266 --> 08:55.433
With dr. Jung's death
wish towards dr. Freud?

08:55.435 --> 08:58.836
Ferenczi knew sigmund
would believe it to be jung.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.441
Why would
dr. Ferenczi want--

09:03.510 --> 09:05.843
Because he wants
to be the favoured son.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.313
His craven adoration
is an embarrassment.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.450
Victor severn said this?

09:12.452 --> 09:15.120
He is the one who is adoring!

09:15.255 --> 09:19.790
He dresses like dr. Freud,
he wears the same beard,

09:19.826 --> 09:21.793
Uh,
smokes the same cigars.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.396
He parrots whatever he says
in the same accent.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.532
And he's
american!

09:29.102 --> 09:32.203
Do you think it's possible that
victor severn sent the threat?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.405
He wouldn't have
the imagination.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.875
There is only one person
who could have who sent it.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.812
The man who knew where we
were to be lunching.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.549
The man who arranged our
whole trip to toronto.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.285
Dr. Jones.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.090
I arranged it all,
that is true.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.891
The tickets, the
restaurant.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.895
At this moment, a group
of my distinguished peers

09:57.931 --> 10:01.565
Are awaiting a lecture that
I organized, boasted about,

10:01.602 --> 10:03.301
But will never take place.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.372
Perhaps you might
inquire of dr. Ferenczi

10:07.374 --> 10:09.908
What analysis he can offer
as to my motivation

10:10.043 --> 10:12.243
In bringing all this on myself.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.182
Well, if you didn't
send it, then who did?

10:18.218 --> 10:21.786
If I knew I would tell you.
As it is...

10:21.921 --> 10:24.555
These are the most brilliant
men of their generation.

10:24.625 --> 10:29.293
Attempting to outwit them
is a fool's errand.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.598
Well, I am not
a stick in the mud.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.067
Of course you're not!

10:36.202 --> 10:37.602
I'm open to new ideas.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.537
You're a veritable
fount of them.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.106
And I'm certainly
not rigid.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.075
Sir?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.210
What have you, henry?

10:46.246 --> 10:47.579
Well, the death
threat was sent

10:47.581 --> 10:49.080
From the union station
telegraph office.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.816
Were you able to get
a description of the sender?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.951
They can't even remember
if it was a man or a woman.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.086
[sighs]

10:56.022 --> 10:56.955
Very well.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.426
Oh! Uh, I'm writing to
george in newfoundland.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.361
Is there anything
you'd like me to say?

11:03.496 --> 11:07.898
Oh, yes! Tell him to say
howdy to his aunts.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.801
Howdy?

11:09.936 --> 11:14.605
And be sure to wish he
and effie a wonderful time.

11:15.909 --> 11:19.577
Certainly. What I mean to say
is can I share your news?

11:19.646 --> 11:22.514
Yes, henry. Please do.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.882
Oh! Yes. Yes.
Right.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.251
Howdy.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.388
Ah, all right.
Tell me again.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.324
I was in front of a building
with double doors.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.959
Do you know this building?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.996
All I know is
it was number 19.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.531
Uh-huh.

11:39.666 --> 11:45.402
I went inside and there was
a foyer with a large staircase.

11:45.439 --> 11:48.373
Top of which was a hallway with
two doors at either end.

11:49.676 --> 11:50.875
I knocked on
the one to the left

11:51.010 --> 11:52.744
And was told I had
the wrong door.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.012
So, you tried the other.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.649
There was no answer, so I went
inside and saw lizzie

11:57.784 --> 11:59.083
Lying on a red blanket

12:00.153 --> 12:01.886
And a strange
man behind her.

12:01.955 --> 12:02.920
Who you didn't know.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.891
And I went to lizzie
and found the red blanket

12:06.893 --> 12:09.160
Was in fact
soaked in blood.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.529
And you saw the man
had a knife?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.933
- I think it was a scalpel.
- Oh! Hmm. Yes.

12:16.303 --> 12:19.704
And you believe this man
murdered your wife?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.674
[telephone rings]

12:28.181 --> 12:30.215
Detective watts.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.182
Yes.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.786
You're certain?

12:34.788 --> 12:36.621
No, no, no.
That's fine.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.525
Mr. Davidson, what is your
wife's full name?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.060
Elizabeth mary davidson.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.864
Elizabeth mary davidson...
And she lives with you

12:46.900 --> 12:49.133
At, uh,
189 water street?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.168
Of course.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.438
Wha-what's going on?

12:55.642 --> 12:58.076
My constable was just
at that address.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.310
He spoke to your
neighbours.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.214
None recall a woman
living with you.

13:04.751 --> 13:05.549
Oh! Stay right there.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.555
As far as I can see they're
just a bunch of eggheads

13:11.591 --> 13:12.957
Who'll talk
themselves to death

13:12.959 --> 13:14.091
Before anyone
can kill them.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.759
I don't disagree, sir.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.862
Brackenreid:
What time's their train?

13:17.898 --> 13:18.963
Ogden:
2:25, I believe.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.264
Perfect.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.967
Release them on condition
that no one kills anyone

13:22.969 --> 13:24.302
Until they've crossed
the border.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.637
Pin this on me?

13:25.772 --> 13:28.573
You asked for my opinion,
I give you my opinion!

13:28.575 --> 13:31.175
Come, come. He was only
diverting blame from himself!

13:31.244 --> 13:32.510
Let go of me now!

13:32.579 --> 13:36.114
Let us not be children.
Or perhaps it was you.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.384
Ferenczi:
Stop. This is enough!

13:40.420 --> 13:41.585
Severn:
Yes. Enough.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.921
Right! The next one to speak,
or move,

13:43.957 --> 13:45.523
Gets a taste
of my knuckles.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.858
Is that understood?

13:48.028 --> 13:48.993
What?

13:49.663 --> 13:50.928
I don't feel well.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.530
It is likely hysteria.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.699
Are you experiencing
chest pain?

13:56.203 --> 13:57.701
It could be angina.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.273
William, look at this.
It's blood.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.877
- What has happened?
- Dr. Severn!

14:06.012 --> 14:08.345
Ferenczi:
What has happened?

14:10.717 --> 14:11.749
He's dead.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.092
Higgins: Turn them out.
Let's see. Turn them right out.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.095
The entrance wound suggests
something round and thin.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.697
A needle?
He was injected?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.831
It's wider than a needle.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.500
I believe it may
have pierced his heart.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.770
He was standing, talking.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.505
Depending on the extent
of the injury,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.040
He could have lived
for more than a minute.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.111
You're saying the man didn't
even know he'd been stabbed?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.647
Adrenaline can keep someone
from feeling the effects

14:42.716 --> 14:44.716
Of even a mortal wound
for a brief time.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.216
Brackenreid:
Murdoch!

14:49.089 --> 14:51.723
None of them did it.
None of them saw anything.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.557
None of them
had anything on them.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.794
Henry, did you see who
dr. Severn was fighting with?

14:56.830 --> 14:58.529
I couldn't tell who was who.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.464
Bloody hell, higgins.
You're a copper.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.666
Well, they look
just like each other!

15:02.702 --> 15:04.735
I even separated them,
and I still couldn't tell.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.771
It had to have been dr. Freud.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.608
He and dr. Severn look very
much alike.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.212
Henry, escort dr. Freud
to the interview room, please.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.613
If you can do that.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.285
Dr. Jung?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.420
I could not help
but overhear.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.288
I believe I can be
of some assistance

15:24.357 --> 15:25.623
Determining
the truth.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.693
How?
Through psychic analysis?

15:29.729 --> 15:32.363
Ah, no.
Through word association.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.033
I have used the technique
to help police solve crimes.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.569
The idea is to allow
the unconscious mind

15:38.705 --> 15:42.974
To speak the truth before the
conscious mind can suppress it.

15:44.511 --> 15:49.113
It is a new idea. I understand
if you are resistant.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.060
Mr. Davidson,

16:03.129 --> 16:06.197
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

16:06.266 --> 16:07.531
I, uh...

16:09.102 --> 16:10.334
I don't remember.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.603
Was it yesterday?

16:13.707 --> 16:14.872
Last week?

16:16.075 --> 16:17.274
Last year?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.712
She's dead, isn't she?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.615
She died four years ago.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.284
How could I have...

16:31.958 --> 16:32.756
How was she killed?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.827
According to
the police report,

16:35.829 --> 16:37.294
She committed
suicide.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.898
No, no. It was him.
He killed her. I know it!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.369
You have to
believe me.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.774
[both speaking foreign language]

16:55.315 --> 16:59.516
Yes. I shouldn't have
said that. I apologize.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.953
Whatever for?
Her death was not my doing.

17:04.924 --> 17:05.923
Shall we proceed?

17:07.027 --> 17:08.059
Yes, of course.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.595
[both speaking foreign language]

17:16.136 --> 17:19.804
Uh, is that young
as in age,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.672
Or jung as in you?

17:23.009 --> 17:24.375
That will require analysis.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.947
Dr. Freud has conflated
these homonyms before.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.950
He believes me
to be the killer.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.287
No doubt based on
his prior interpretations

17:36.356 --> 17:38.622
Of latent displacement.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.424
You dreamt of skulls,

17:40.493 --> 17:43.227
Ancient skulls,
in your basement.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.695
Not yours.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.564
Then whose?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.633
If you must know,
it was your wife.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.367
And her sister.

17:54.774 --> 17:58.041
Why would you think dr. Jung
would kill dr. Severn?

17:58.078 --> 18:00.311
Dr. Freud believes
I desired to kill him.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.147
When I said murder,
he said mich - me.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.883
Not ich - I.
Object, not subject.

18:05.952 --> 18:09.186
Dr. Severn imitated
me in every way.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.725
So, you think dr. Jung may
have mistaken him for you?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.195
It was not a mistake.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.531
His unconscious mind
was at war with itself.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.068
One part wished my death,
the other could not allow it

18:24.070 --> 18:28.405
And redirected his hand
to my doppelganger.

18:28.407 --> 18:32.076
Ah! A brilliant analysis.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.379
Albeit completely wrong.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.221
Is that my letter to george?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.491
Your lover's name
is george?

18:47.527 --> 18:50.227
George? No. No, george.
George is my friend.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.831
You like to say
his name, yeah?

18:55.401 --> 18:57.168
Brackenreid:
Freud believes jung killed him?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.570
- Apparently.
- Why?

18:59.572 --> 19:00.905
Well, sir, it's a--

19:00.907 --> 19:03.707
Sir, this just in.
Oh, no... This.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.679
Es war... It was...

19:08.715 --> 19:11.582
It says: “it was meant
for you, dr. Freud.”

19:13.286 --> 19:14.718
Detective watts translated it.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.188
Do you think one
of this lot sent it?

19:18.224 --> 19:19.657
Certainly possible.

19:19.726 --> 19:23.060
They would merely have had
to pick up the telephone

19:23.062 --> 19:24.528
And call
the telegraph office.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.065
Higgins, get one of the lads to
go down to the telegraph office.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.666
See if he can
find out who sent this.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.168
Sirs.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.472
Well, dr. Freud was right.
He is the intended target.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.609
Mrs. Hart and I have
determined the implement

19:38.678 --> 19:40.477
That pierced
dr. Severn's chest.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.215
It's a narrow spike
at least four inches long.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.616
It passed through
his heart.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.119
- A knitting needle?
- Possibly.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.955
But it would have
taken some force

19:51.090 --> 19:52.823
To penetrate so deeply
and through cloth.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.825
I wonder where it is now?

19:56.162 --> 19:57.461
Sirs!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.903
It certainly looks
like the murder weapon.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.806
[both blowing]

20:12.378 --> 20:14.178
There's definitely
a fingermark on it.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.781
Henry, obtain fingermark
samples from all of them.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.117
- Find out which one is a match.
- Sir.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.987
Ah, dr. Ogden!

20:23.056 --> 20:24.554
Oh! Yes, detective?

20:25.959 --> 20:28.459
This man came in suffering from
what I believe to be

20:28.528 --> 20:31.462
Severe dissociation
related to his wife's death

20:31.464 --> 20:35.066
And it appears you
performed the postmortem.

20:35.201 --> 20:38.069
Ah, elizabeth davidson.
Yes, I recall.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.905
Suicide,
if I remember correctly.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.074
Is that finding
definitive?

20:44.510 --> 20:45.776
Well...

20:47.013 --> 20:49.480
She was found in a bath
with a longitudinal wound

20:49.549 --> 20:50.881
On her left wrist.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.183
The algor mortis
and the temperature of the water

20:53.219 --> 20:56.621
Were consistent with
her having laid in a warm bath

20:56.756 --> 20:58.555
And cut her wrists.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.091
Could she have
been murdered?

21:02.028 --> 21:03.494
Well, it's possible.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.295
She...

21:05.632 --> 21:08.299
She did have high levels
of opium in her system.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.636
Do you have reason
to suspect murder?

21:17.843 --> 21:18.643
Detective.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.412
Dr. Freud.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.518
Are you familiar with
the term parapraxis?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.990
A slip of the tongue.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.792
An unintentional error

21:34.861 --> 21:37.461
That betrays the workings
of the subconscious.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.597
Recite the
telegram, please.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.602
Es war für dich, dr freud.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.805
Ah! The sender used "dich."
not "sie."

21:49.776 --> 21:51.141
I'm afraid I don't understand.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.077
Well, both words mean “you”"

21:54.113 --> 21:56.080
But dich is informal.

21:57.216 --> 22:00.084
Ah, one uses it with
family, close friends,

22:00.219 --> 22:02.687
Those whom we call
by their first names,

22:02.822 --> 22:07.691
Yet he refers to me
by my title: Dr. Freud.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.095
Seems like a simple
enough mistake.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.665
No german would ever
make such a mistake.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.636
You're saying, then, that
the sender was not german?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.772
I am saying the sender is
suffering

22:21.808 --> 22:23.908
From emotional
dissonance,

22:23.910 --> 22:27.578
A man who wishes
to be both a son

22:27.580 --> 22:29.513
And a peer.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.849
It grieves me to say
only one person

22:31.918 --> 22:33.316
Matches such
a description.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.652
Dr. Jung.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.457
Sir, we have a match
for the fingermark.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.591
Who is it?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.526
It's dr. Jung, sir.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.601
Dich, not sie.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.871
Dr. Freud claims
he is both

22:54.006 --> 22:58.275
A formal mentor figure
and, as per your slip,

22:58.277 --> 23:00.177
A member of your family.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.680
His analysis is sound.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.750
I have cared very deeply
for dr. Freud.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.687
We once shared a deep
bond of friendship.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.756
You once did?

23:12.792 --> 23:14.425
Our philosophies
are diverging.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.826
How so?

23:15.828 --> 23:17.962
He is focused on
his own theories

23:17.964 --> 23:20.130
To the exclusion
of all others.

23:23.636 --> 23:27.505
Unfortunately, doctor, we have
proof of your involvement.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.907
The murder weapon
has been identified.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.309
A paper spike,
like this one,

23:32.378 --> 23:35.446
Was taken from
constable higgins' desk.

23:36.716 --> 23:37.881
And?

23:39.318 --> 23:42.752
And your fingermarks are on it.

23:43.989 --> 23:47.691
I see. And you believe
this confirms my guilt.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.774
Anything else?

24:06.913 --> 24:10.514
Dr. Jung claims to have picked
up the paper spike

24:10.516 --> 24:12.616
In order to
replace it on the desk.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.752
I suppose it could have
fallen off in the scuffle.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.620
I didn't see him
pick it up, though.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.356
Based on the orientation of the
fingermarks,

24:19.358 --> 24:21.491
All we can ascertain
is that he did, in fact,

24:21.527 --> 24:22.626
Pick it up.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.363
But, holding it thusly would
not have allowed the killer

24:26.365 --> 24:29.300
To strike dr. Severn with
enough force to kill him.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.770
Unless, of course,
he picked it up

24:34.773 --> 24:39.042
And then stabbed
dr. Severn in the chest.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.911
How do we prove it?

24:40.947 --> 24:41.945
Henry...

24:43.916 --> 24:46.116
There are marks under
the bottom of the base

24:46.185 --> 24:47.384
Of the murder weapon.

24:47.453 --> 24:50.120
I believe these
to be palm marks.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.555
Ah, palm marks?

24:52.291 --> 24:53.623
Yes. Look at your hand.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.460
On your palm
there are ridges,

24:56.595 --> 24:58.762
Similar to those
of your fingertips.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.464
Oh, yes.

25:00.466 --> 25:03.200
It shouldn't be too difficult
to get a palm print

25:03.269 --> 25:05.101
From our circle
of suspects.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.071
We had best
get started, henry.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.747
Ugh.
You'll have to do it again.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.551
Doctor, I wonder
if I might be able

25:21.587 --> 25:22.953
To have a moment
of your time?

25:23.088 --> 25:24.354
Uh, of course.

25:24.423 --> 25:26.690
Dr. Ogden tells me that you're
the world's leading expert

25:26.759 --> 25:28.158
On the workings
of the mind.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.693
Uh, this is correct.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.661
Then I wonder if you
could offer me some guidance?

25:31.697 --> 25:33.764
The missus, my wife margaret,

25:33.833 --> 25:35.765
Has been having some
troubles of late.

25:35.801 --> 25:36.767
Come in, come in.

25:36.836 --> 25:40.370
Oh, thank you.
Uh, what type of troubles?

25:42.208 --> 25:43.506
She's been harping on
about everything.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.510
I'm working too much,
I'm eating too much,

25:46.645 --> 25:47.912
I'm drinking too much.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.714
Are you drinking too much?

25:50.783 --> 25:53.584
Well, I don't think so.
Same as ever.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.119
Uh, but here's where
you come in, doctor.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.255
I don't think it's me
that she's worried about.

25:59.292 --> 26:03.193
Ah! You think her true
concern is displaced.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.062
Ah.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.531
Our son, bobby, has had
a spot of bother with the law.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.402
He killed a man.
Well, two men.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.737
I see.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.005
And now he's on the run.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.341
If he comes back,
they could hang him.

26:17.343 --> 26:20.477
All sons are in conflict with
their fathers.

26:20.546 --> 26:23.681
I was with my father,
my sons are with me.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.416
But bobby and I have
never had any trouble.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.485
Ah, you are the police.

26:28.487 --> 26:32.022
Any crime your son commits
is an attack on you,

26:32.058 --> 26:35.826
A manifest expression of
his subconscious hatred of you.

26:35.961 --> 26:37.294
Why would he hate me?

26:38.697 --> 26:41.231
Well, a child is born and
falls in love with his mother.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.835
When he becomes aware
of his father's intimate role,

26:44.970 --> 26:47.438
He wishes to
usurp him.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.775
You're saying my
son wants to...

26:52.911 --> 26:53.777
Well, yeah...

26:53.779 --> 26:55.278
With his own mother?

26:55.348 --> 26:57.715
I was going to ask you
for an autograph!

26:57.717 --> 26:58.782
Get out!

26:58.784 --> 27:00.884
Not another bloody word!

27:01.020 --> 27:02.853
- Well, inspector, I--
- not another word!

27:10.196 --> 27:11.795
What have you, henry?

27:11.797 --> 27:13.697
Ah! Well, I'm only
on the second one, sir.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.298
It's harder
than it seems.

27:16.369 --> 27:17.867
What did you find out
with the first one?

27:17.903 --> 27:20.638
Well, I've only just got the
print. I haven't checked it yet.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.842
- This is dr. Jung's?
- Yes.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.277
Well, then, check
this one first.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.279
If it's a match,
there's no need to proceed.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.482
Huh! Yes, sir.

27:31.617 --> 27:34.418
Um, uh, what do I do now?

27:37.723 --> 27:39.022
What's wrong with me?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.826
Traumatic events can cause
the mind to fracture,

27:42.862 --> 27:45.829
And painful memories
can be repressed.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.632
Do you still believe
that she was murdered?

27:48.701 --> 27:49.966
Yes.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.768
And you're convinced
it was the man from your dream.

27:55.675 --> 27:56.940
Excuse us.

27:59.111 --> 27:59.976
What do you think?

28:01.981 --> 28:04.448
Repressed memories can
certainly emerge in dreams,

28:04.517 --> 28:06.450
But they have to
be decoded.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.652
They can't be taken
at face value.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.588
And we have the world's
leading dream decoder

28:11.657 --> 28:13.256
In our
station house.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.959
Oedipus.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.262
Sir! It is not dr. Jung.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.663
You're quite sure?

28:20.700 --> 28:23.801
I divided the palm print
into these six quadrants.

28:23.936 --> 28:24.801
Sextants.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.071
What?

28:27.206 --> 28:30.006
Quadrants would be if
there were... Never mind.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.143
So, no portion of his
palm print matches

28:33.212 --> 28:34.544
The one found on
the murder weapon?

28:34.580 --> 28:36.012
No, sir.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.283
Uh, you are certain?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.284
Dr. Jung's palm print
did not match

28:41.320 --> 28:42.486
That of
the murder weapon.

28:42.621 --> 28:46.055
Well, I am, uh, vastly
relieved, of course.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.026
Assuming your original
theory holds.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.462
Ah, displaced
oedipal aggression.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.035
Could the same apply

28:58.170 --> 29:00.904
To another one
of your acolytes?

29:02.374 --> 29:03.840
Well, I...

29:03.909 --> 29:06.577
I've never seen any
of them as a son.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.111
But, huh!

29:08.180 --> 29:10.647
That does not mean they do not
see me as a father.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.451
In fact, dr. Ferenczi
sent me a letter

29:14.586 --> 29:17.587
In which he confessed to
wanting to kill me.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.191
What? When?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.226
Uh, some months ago.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.162
And you didn't
think to tell me?

29:25.297 --> 29:28.331
I'd always assumed
it was a cloying attempt

29:28.367 --> 29:30.934
To gain favour
by affirming my theories.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.605
He was so eager
to please you

29:36.542 --> 29:37.674
He told you he
wished to kill you?

29:37.743 --> 29:39.476
Yeah, that's right.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.615
Murdoch: Perhaps it's time to
take dr. Ferenczi at his word.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.051
This is ridiculous.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.021
You deny writing
the letter?

29:51.156 --> 29:55.625
The letter was
an academic exploration

29:55.661 --> 29:57.961
Of my psychic
tendencies.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.164
Did you harbour such
feelings, or did you not?

30:01.233 --> 30:03.767
One harbours
all manner of thoughts.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.104
Well, then, I'm afraid if
you've thought it,

30:07.239 --> 30:08.371
You have motive.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.509
I understand your logic,
detective.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.711
But this
is impossible.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.980
You can rest
assured of this

30:17.115 --> 30:19.282
Because during
the altercation

30:19.318 --> 30:22.452
I was nowhere
near dr. Severn.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.890
The closest I came was when I
was face to face with dr. Jones.

30:28.627 --> 30:32.962
Dr. Severn
was behind dr. Jones.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.402
Jones was next to
dr. Severn?

30:39.338 --> 30:40.470
Yes.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.878
I was face to face
with ferenczi, yes.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.280
But I have no clue
who was behind me.

30:52.785 --> 30:55.085
Dr. Ferenczi was
pulled off of you.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.620
What did you do then?

30:56.689 --> 30:58.421
I sat down.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.626
You sat down?
In the middle of a fight?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.227
My back ails me.

31:04.296 --> 31:07.431
Grappling with ferenczi
didn't help, so I sat.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.366
Where?

31:10.168 --> 31:11.034
In a chair.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.171
After that,
the constables interceded,

31:14.306 --> 31:15.805
And I stood back up
and moved away.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.107
But I was never
near severn.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.880
This is mr. Davidson.

31:25.618 --> 31:28.051
You would like me to
interpret this man's dreams?

31:28.186 --> 31:31.521
One dream, in particular.
A nightmare of sorts.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.824
Murdoch, mcnabb just got back
from the telegraph office.

31:35.661 --> 31:36.393
The threat
wasn't called in.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.397
Well, it can't have been
any of our suspects.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.065
None of them have
left the building.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.900
It was sent from
our telegraph machine.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.269
What?

31:47.205 --> 31:49.406
One of them has snuck
into our telegraph room

31:49.475 --> 31:50.873
And sent it
directly?

31:50.910 --> 31:51.808
It seems that way.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.218
So, I go to the other door,
and I open it.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.220
And I can see lizzie
lying on a couch

32:04.256 --> 32:05.956
On top of
a red blanket.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.025
And there is a man
behind her.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.896
Is she clothed or naked?

32:14.133 --> 32:16.433
Naked. How did you?

32:16.568 --> 32:17.567
Continue please.

32:18.671 --> 32:19.669
So, I go to lizzie,

32:21.240 --> 32:23.507
But when I reach her,
I realize the blanket is red

32:23.642 --> 32:24.741
Because it is
soaked in her blood.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.378
Then I look up
and I see that the man's hands

32:28.414 --> 32:30.747
Are covered in blood
and he's holding a scalpel.

32:31.951 --> 32:36.085
And he says, “i have
completed my dissection.”

33:00.779 --> 33:03.480
This man, standing
behind your wife...

33:03.615 --> 33:04.947
Sitting, actually.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.484
Can you see his face?

33:07.553 --> 33:08.985
Yes.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.421
But I can't make it out.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.424
Is he young, or old?

33:14.460 --> 33:15.625
Old.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.294
Could it represent her father?

33:19.765 --> 33:22.699
Her father molested her
when she was a child.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.802
In any case, it is
your dream, not hers.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.105
Which way does he
part his hair?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.074
To the right.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.576
The opposite of yours.

33:33.979 --> 33:34.978
Yes.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.079
Watts:
Uh, doctor...

33:38.884 --> 33:40.384
What are you thinking?

33:41.720 --> 33:45.188
All dreams are derived
from wish fulfillment,

33:45.257 --> 33:48.257
But, uh, what
is the wish?

33:49.028 --> 33:50.327
To save his wife, I assume.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.896
Or is it to reveal
her killer?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.865
So, you think she was killed?

33:54.867 --> 33:56.399
I have no doubt.

33:56.468 --> 34:01.104
As the manifest content
makes clear, he saw the killer.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.875
Normally, a naked
person represents desire,

34:05.911 --> 34:08.744
But in this case,
I think it is a repressed memory

34:08.781 --> 34:09.946
Of her death.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.950
She's naked because he found
her that way in the bath?

34:15.354 --> 34:16.419
Precisely.

34:18.924 --> 34:21.958
There is a mirror
in your bathroom?

34:22.494 --> 34:23.493
Yes.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.563
That is why the hair part is
reversed.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.968
The man you see is
your own reflection.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.506
You're lying.
You're a liar!

34:38.510 --> 34:40.577
The diameter is
definitely cigar ash.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.246
There's only two cigar
smokers in this lot

34:43.381 --> 34:44.581
And one of them's
dead.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.250
And the one who sent
the telegram must be the other.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.719
Why would freud send
a death threat to himself?

34:49.721 --> 34:52.788
To convince us that he was
the target and not the killer?

34:53.459 --> 34:54.490
Higgins.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.593
Where are you at
with those palm marks?

34:57.629 --> 34:59.863
I'm finished with everyone
but dr. Freud, sir.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.430
He's been detained
by detective watts.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.267
So, the palm mark on the murder
weapon isn't a match

35:04.303 --> 35:05.468
For any of
the others?

35:05.537 --> 35:07.003
No, sir.
I checked them all twice.

35:08.373 --> 35:10.340
By logic of deduction...

35:10.409 --> 35:11.941
The killer
is sigmund freud.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.611
Sirs.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.423
I was in your
telegraph room, yes.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.460
Why?

35:30.462 --> 35:32.762
To send a telegram.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.597
A death threat.
Against yourself.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.831
No.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.769
The threat was sent from
that telegraph machine.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.506
You claim you sent a different
telegram from the same machine?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.440
That is correct.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.542
What was this message that
you sent? And to whom?

35:48.547 --> 35:50.847
I decline to discuss
this matter.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.849
Dr. Freud, you are
being interviewed

35:52.984 --> 35:54.184
Under suspicion of
murder.

35:54.186 --> 35:57.320
Suspicion without evidence.

35:57.322 --> 36:00.456
Of a murder for which
I have no motive.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.994
You confronted the man,
physically, during the melee.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.596
We were in the same place
at the same time.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.731
It was
a coincidence.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.732
You had him by
the bloody lapels.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.033
Our constable saw you.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.004
I do not remember this.

36:16.608 --> 36:19.409
Perhaps your subconscious
suppressed the memory?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.412
Dr. Severn annoyed me.

36:22.481 --> 36:27.017
His admiration was uncritical.
He imitated me.

36:27.152 --> 36:31.354
Or your subconscious
identified him as you.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.157
As me?

36:35.627 --> 36:38.894
Your death wish toward him was,
in fact, a personal death wish

36:38.931 --> 36:41.497
Spurred on by your own
self-hatred.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.369
Well, uh, yah. Interesting.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.905
But inaccurate.

36:51.309 --> 36:54.978
I'm afraid I have no more
to say on this matter.

36:55.113 --> 36:57.580
You can say no more in
our cells. Constable!

36:58.684 --> 37:02.052
Wait. All right.

37:04.022 --> 37:08.591
If you must know, the telegram
I sent was to minna,

37:08.594 --> 37:10.593
My wife's
sister.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.863
This is the sister
from dr. Jung's dream?

37:13.932 --> 37:16.733
Dr. Jung dreamed
of two skulls

37:16.802 --> 37:19.936
He found buried together
deep beneath his house.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.939
I had assumed it was
another manifestation

37:23.008 --> 37:24.740
Of his death wish
towards me,

37:25.811 --> 37:29.546
But I see now that
the skulls represented

37:31.316 --> 37:34.617
A secret he had buried.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.685
You
understand?

37:35.721 --> 37:37.153
No. Not really.

37:38.824 --> 37:42.158
He believes minna
and I had an affair.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.759
Did you?

37:44.963 --> 37:46.696
I don't see how
this is relevant.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.901
Ah, sirs -- there's a problem.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.037
What is it, henry?

37:54.106 --> 37:55.639
I only left them for a moment,
I swear, but...

37:55.774 --> 37:57.907
Someone has taken the paper
spike and the fingermarks.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.442
Er, palm marks.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.777
What? All of them?

38:00.846 --> 38:02.745
I was about to compare
them to dr. Freud's.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.481
He was in the interview room
the whole time.

38:06.318 --> 38:07.383
Who else was
near that area?

38:07.452 --> 38:08.918
All of them, at one point
or another, sir.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.554
- Well, search them.
- I have, sir.

38:11.556 --> 38:13.756
Nothing. One of them must have
stashed them somewhere,

38:13.792 --> 38:16.292
But the lads are already
searching the station house.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.130
It had to have been one of them,
trying to protect dr. Freud.

38:20.265 --> 38:23.265
Although I am skeptical that
he is, in fact, the killer.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.201
But none of
the other prints match.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.402
It has to be him.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.475
Murdoch:
Don't turn around, henry.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.310
What if it was someone else?

38:39.985 --> 38:44.220
<i> During the melee, ernest jones</i>
<i> stated that he took a seat</i>

38:44.222 --> 38:46.956
<i> Because his back was in pain.</i>

38:46.958 --> 38:51.427
<i> Meaning that mr. Davidson was</i>
<i> not at his customary seat</i>

38:51.463 --> 38:53.028
<i> Over by watts' desk.</i>

38:54.566 --> 38:58.167
<i> Instead he was in a position</i>
<i> to pick up the paper spike</i>

38:58.236 --> 39:01.904
<i> And to strike the man</i>
<i> he believed</i>

39:01.940 --> 39:03.305
<i> Was dr. Freud.</i>

39:05.544 --> 39:07.410
Why the bloody hell
would he do that?

39:07.412 --> 39:09.912
He was in the station house
before that lot even arrived.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.480
He doesn't know
these people.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.551
Ogden:
Is it painful?

39:14.553 --> 39:15.951
Detective watts?

39:16.388 --> 39:17.387
Hmm, yes?

39:22.060 --> 39:24.327
What was the name
of mr. Davidson's wife?

39:24.462 --> 39:25.995
Elizabeth davidson.

39:27.332 --> 39:30.400
I quipped the only death wish
he correctly diagnosed

39:30.469 --> 39:32.001
Was edie's.

39:32.804 --> 39:36.672
Edie. E.D.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.943
Could they be
one and the same?

39:43.215 --> 39:48.651
Dr. Freud. Your patient
who committed suicide, edie?

39:49.654 --> 39:51.620
This was a pseudonym,
I take it?

39:51.656 --> 39:55.692
Yes. I would not publish
details of a patient's case

39:55.827 --> 39:57.427
Under her real name.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.764
Doctor, we need to know
your patient's name.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.500
It could have bearing
on this investigation.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.904
Her name was
elizabeth davidson.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.840
That's her. Charlie's wife
was freud's patient.

40:14.612 --> 40:16.312
That's right, doctor.

40:16.314 --> 40:17.647
I'm the one who's
going to kill you.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.883
Mr. Davidson,
don't do anything rash.

40:19.885 --> 40:22.785
Rash? I've been
planning this for years.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.321
Dreaming of it every
night since I found her.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.990
Your wife suffered from
hysteria

40:28.059 --> 40:30.726
Brought about by an
unresolved wish

40:30.796 --> 40:32.061
To possess
her father.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.395
It was her father
who possessed her.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.065
Night after night he came
into her room

40:36.134 --> 40:37.834
While her mother
pretended not to notice.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.736
It was my belief these
memories represented

40:40.772 --> 40:43.840
The psychic repression
of latent desire.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.310
You made her doubt
what she knew to be true!

40:48.480 --> 40:50.213
She came back
thinking she had lost her mind.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.348
Nothing I said, or did, made
any difference.

40:52.384 --> 40:54.617
Your dream?
It was an allusion to freud.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.152
I wanted him to know
who was killing him and why.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.221
Easy, davidson.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.589
But he was too
arrogant to see it.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.626
And now he's going to get
what he deserves.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.894
Why don't I just
give him a sock?

41:06.164 --> 41:08.197
What is sock?

41:08.200 --> 41:09.465
Murdoch:
Watts!

41:11.102 --> 41:13.436
No! No!

41:17.476 --> 41:20.175
I heard freud was
travelling to niagara falls.

41:20.212 --> 41:22.045
I was going to
go there to find him.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.913
But then I got word
he was coming to toronto.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.383
You waited for him
at the train station.

41:28.386 --> 41:29.785
I overheard where
they were dining

41:29.821 --> 41:30.920
And sent
the letter ahead.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.454
With a razor in it.

41:32.491 --> 41:35.424
What use is revenge if the
subject doesn't see it coming?

41:36.328 --> 41:38.194
Were you there to
see him find it?

41:38.329 --> 41:43.399
No. By the time I arrived, your
constables were arresting them.

41:43.435 --> 41:46.869
So, I decided to get here first.
Wasn't what I'd planned.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.007
But I knew just the story to
make up, so you'd keep me here.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.875
Well, it worked.

41:52.878 --> 41:56.412
Yes. Got to watch him squirm.

41:56.481 --> 41:58.948
You killed a man, mr. Davidson.

42:00.752 --> 42:04.487
Yes. That was regrettable.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.222
I suppose I'll hang for it.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.525
But it was freud
I wished to kill.

42:11.496 --> 42:12.762
Yet he lives on.

42:14.465 --> 42:17.166
I only hope his ideas die out
before they take hold.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.202
Well, goodbye, doctor.

42:20.238 --> 42:22.905
I'm sorry we didn't get
to see your lecture.

42:22.974 --> 42:23.839
Oh!

42:23.875 --> 42:24.908
Perhaps on your
next visit.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.242
Oh, I can assure you,

42:26.377 --> 42:29.244
This will be my last
trip to the americas.

42:29.281 --> 42:32.014
Yes. Attempted murder does
leave a certain taste.

42:33.251 --> 42:36.986
Oh, it's not that. It's the
food, the culture, the...

42:38.223 --> 42:42.257
Intrusive informality.
I simply do not care for it.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.993
Auf wiederschauen.

42:46.898 --> 42:50.866
Well, what do you think?

42:50.868 --> 42:53.603
Will psychic analysis
be the way of the future?

42:53.605 --> 42:57.006
I doubt it. Dr. Freud was
wrong about nearly everything.

42:57.042 --> 42:58.341
He was right
about one thing.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.610
Oh, that hardly
seems fair.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.879
You told him
everything about me.

43:03.949 --> 43:08.150
All I did was describe a stick
in the mud that I wouldn't...

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
I wouldn't change
for anything.

43:12.891 --> 43:15.825
Now, william, you can take your
hands out of your pockets now.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.698
Eggheads!
They're all bloody crackers.

43:21.833 --> 43:25.501
Any attempt to know the minds
of men seems like folly to me.

43:25.537 --> 43:28.905
Maybe so. But even I could do
a better job than dr. Freud.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.174
I'll say. Dr. Freud said
I'm in love with george.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.208
[laughs]

43:36.047 --> 43:38.080
Even a broken clock's
correct twice a day.
