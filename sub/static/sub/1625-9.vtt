00:02.618 --> 00:03.634

look in the mirror

00:03.635 --> 00:05.202

I'm still dead in the eyes.

00:06.255 --> 00:08.988
You think you can

00:08.990 --> 00:12.375
Uh, yeah,
I think I can handle it.

00:12.377 --> 00:14.227
Hey, Earl,
I don't know if you noticed,

00:14.229 --> 00:15.829
but I'm running
the whole diner right now.

00:15.831 --> 00:17.931
What, what?

00:18.433 --> 00:20.500
The customer at table ten
appears to be choking,

00:20.502 --> 00:22.302
and I would help,

00:22.304 --> 00:24.554
but the last time I gave
a white woman the heimlich,

00:24.556 --> 00:27.507
I did six months
in the Birmingham city jail.

00:27.509 --> 00:30.310
Oh, my God,
are you choking?

00:30.312 --> 00:32.812
Oh, my God,
I feel like you're choking!

00:32.814 --> 00:34.447
Is anyone here a doctor?

00:34.449 --> 00:36.283

I know my name is weird,
but like it's too late, right?

06:30.962 --> 06:33.713
Max, why are you
trying to convince her

06:33.715 --> 06:34.998
to not be our intern?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.750
Why are you not saying,

06:36.752 --> 06:40.503
"You may get rabies and
bubonic plague from our rats?"

06:42.306 --> 06:43.890
Don't mention the rats.

You're chasing them away.
And we do not have rats.

06:46.461 --> 06:49.562
We have rat droppings.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

06:49.564 --> 06:51.397
You're right,
the rats are probably

have to do that.

is goin' on here?

or pretty chairs.

is so unappealing,

don't poop in it.

09:37.649 --> 09:38.631
Um...

09:39.133 --> 09:40.166
You know what?
I got it.

09:40.168 --> 09:42.769
It's not like
you're getting paid.

09:43.471 --> 09:46.106
Big boob people
are so much easier.

10:00.624 --> 10:01.758
As a kid,
people told you

10:01.760 --> 10:03.927
everything you did was amazing,
didn't they?

10:04.429 --> 10:06.929
I was given a lot
of positive reinforcement.

10:06.931 --> 10:08.481
I think it gave me
the confidence

10:08.483 --> 10:10.316
that's gotten me
through this last year.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.919
Well, it's time
you heard the truth.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.287
You stink at stuff.

10:14.289 --> 10:16.439
Like painting.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.941
Fine.
And you stink at stuff too.

10:18.943 --> 10:21.194
Like telling an intern
what to do.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.062
Ruth had to go
to that concert.

10:23.064 --> 10:25.031
She had the tickets
for weeks.

10:25.033 --> 10:28.100
It was Ashley D and Ashley B's
joint birthday. Duh.

10:28.102 --> 10:29.986
And so the intern's
out having fun,

10:29.988 --> 10:34.657
and here we are, the bosses,
painting the walls at 3:00 a.m.

10:34.659 --> 10:35.958
Well, I'm painting.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.294
You got a kind of
autistic ballerina thing

10:38.296 --> 10:40.713
going on over there.

10:40.715 --> 10:42.114
Can I ask you something?

10:42.116 --> 10:44.000
I don't like Maroon 5.

10:44.002 --> 10:45.451
No matter
how many times you ask,

10:45.453 --> 10:47.336
the answer
will always be no.

10:47.338 --> 10:49.055
Not that.

10:49.057 --> 10:51.290
Would it be okay if I told Andy
not to come over tonight

10:51.292 --> 10:52.892
'cause I'm so exhausted,

10:52.894 --> 10:55.011
or is it a little too early
in the relationship to be all,

10:55.013 --> 10:58.297
"I don't think I can have my
legs up around my ears tonight"?

10:58.299 --> 10:59.300
It's fine.

10:59.301 --> 11:01.133
You don't think
he'd enjoy a night off

11:01.135 --> 11:03.936
from constant Maroon 5
badgering? He would.

11:05.438 --> 11:06.605
Feels awkward. Can't.

11:06.607 --> 11:08.857
My legs can go up there.
They're fine.

11:08.859 --> 11:11.410
I don't want to have that
conversation right now.

11:11.412 --> 11:12.945
Hey, look, I get it.

11:12.947 --> 11:14.514
There are conversations
you don't want to have.

11:14.566 --> 11:18.368
Like, "hey, Ruth, here's $0.
Put down some rat traps."

11:18.370 --> 11:20.587
We have a box right here
that's not touched.

11:20.589 --> 11:22.622
Look, we're not talking
about your relationship anymore.

11:22.624 --> 11:24.591
We're done.

11:24.593 --> 11:27.210
Relax. It's probably not even
a rat, it's probably a mouse.

11:27.212 --> 11:30.129
Not a big deal.

11:30.131 --> 11:33.049
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
I see it! There it is!

11:33.051 --> 11:35.251
- The mouse?
- That is not a mouse!

11:35.253 --> 11:37.637
That is a car
that a mouse drives!

11:37.639 --> 11:40.189
Where did you see it?
It was in the middle, right?

11:40.191 --> 11:42.392
- Shh!
- Why are you whispering?

11:42.394 --> 11:43.926
I don't want him
to hear me.

11:43.928 --> 11:45.111
How do you know it's a he?

11:45.113 --> 11:47.947
He looked at me
kind of rapey.

11:48.649 --> 11:50.099
There!
He just ran behind the thing!

11:50.101 --> 11:51.484
- What thing?
- That thing!

11:51.486 --> 11:53.736
This thing? Waah!

11:53.738 --> 11:55.038
What? Did you see it?

11:55.040 --> 11:56.706
I don't think so.

11:56.708 --> 11:57.790
Oh, you'd know so.
It has a saddle.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.042
[Gasps]

12:01.295 --> 12:04.280
Oh, my God.

12:04.282 --> 12:08.167
He just opened the door with
the strength of his whiskers.

12:10.471 --> 12:12.221
He's gone.
He went into the kitchen.

12:12.223 --> 12:13.256
Oh, what should we do?

12:13.258 --> 12:14.791
Should we call the cops?

12:14.793 --> 12:17.260
He doesn't have a gun.

12:17.262 --> 12:18.761
Let's just get out of here.

12:18.763 --> 12:20.680
We'll call an exterminator
in the morning.

12:20.682 --> 12:22.348
[Gasps]

12:22.350 --> 12:24.117
Too late,
he's coming back!

12:24.119 --> 12:26.736
Aah! He's charging us!
He's gonna bite me!

12:26.738 --> 12:29.739
[Growls]

12:34.978 --> 12:37.080
Waah!
You can stop now!

12:37.082 --> 12:40.833
You painted him to death.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.876
I just got a glimpse of you
at a Barneys sample sale.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.029
What a mess.
Who's gonna clean that up?

12:53.931 --> 12:56.966
The intern?

12:59.870 --> 13:01.670
Oh, Andy...

13:01.672 --> 13:04.340
I know.
I'm good at this.

13:04.342 --> 13:07.176
[Moaning increases,
turns to cries]

13:07.178 --> 13:09.228
What?
Is there another rat?

13:09.230 --> 13:11.947
What are you doing?

13:11.949 --> 13:14.066
I forgot Andy was here!

13:14.068 --> 13:18.270
And your sex voice is the same
as your murder voice.

13:18.272 --> 13:21.157
So are you just
gonna stand there?

13:21.159 --> 13:25.661
Are you offering me
a three-way?

13:25.663 --> 13:28.197
[Buzzer sounds]

13:28.199 --> 13:32.151
Well, it looks like we're
about to be a full-blown orgy.

13:32.153 --> 13:34.653
It's 2:00 a.m.
Who could this be?

13:34.655 --> 13:35.788
It's Ruth.

13:35.790 --> 13:38.858
- Ruth?
- Yes. I'm late, right?

13:39.210 --> 13:40.710
Why is she here?

13:40.712 --> 13:43.713
I texted her and said
you needed an enema.

13:43.715 --> 13:46.799
Okay, now, this is some
industrial-strength girl talk.

13:46.801 --> 13:49.268
I had to do something
to show her who was boss.

13:49.270 --> 13:51.270
I learned it while interning
at Condé Nast.

13:51.272 --> 13:53.022
We've all
gotten someone an enema

13:53.024 --> 13:54.857
in the middle of the night,
it's a right of passage.

13:54.859 --> 13:57.393
For someone to get
their passage right?

13:57.895 --> 13:59.061
Beat me to it.

13:59.563 --> 14:00.696
[Knock on door]

14:01.198 --> 14:04.150
There. Go open the door.
You know what has to happen.

14:05.285 --> 14:06.936
Max has to put Ruth
in her place

14:06.938 --> 14:09.205
so she can learn
how to be a boss.

14:09.207 --> 14:10.823
Oh. That's all? Good.

14:10.825 --> 14:12.124
'Cause I thought
from your tone

14:12.126 --> 14:13.993
you were gonna force Max
to have an enema.

14:14.695 --> 14:15.828
Sorry I'm late.

14:15.830 --> 14:19.999
I had the tiniest pot cookie and
had to pull over to take a nap.

14:21.051 --> 14:24.303
Anyway, here is your enema.
Enjoy.

14:24.305 --> 14:26.121
They only had
the triple pack.

14:26.123 --> 14:27.523
Wait, Ruth?

14:27.525 --> 14:29.291
Max has something
she wants to say to you.

14:29.293 --> 14:31.143
Max, what did you
want to say to Ruth?

14:31.145 --> 14:35.014
Um,
thanks for the triple?

14:35.016 --> 14:37.018
Three times the fun.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.322
[Trap snaps]

14:43.324 --> 14:44.407
You sure you don't want me
to help you with that?

14:45.109 --> 14:46.025
Oh, no, it's okay.

14:46.027 --> 14:48.444
You took the rat traps out
of the box, you need a break.

14:48.446 --> 14:49.745
Plus, we couldn't afford

14:49.747 --> 14:51.414
the game <i>Mouse Trap</i>
when I was a kid,

14:51.416 --> 14:53.749
and this is the closest
I'm gonna get.

14:53.751 --> 14:56.035
So, when do you
make the cupcakes?

14:56.037 --> 14:57.837
Um...

14:57.839 --> 14:59.755
I guess I could
make them now.

14:59.757 --> 15:01.340
Fun.
I'll go get the coffees, right?

15:01.342 --> 15:03.009
Sure, of course.
Do whatever.

15:03.011 --> 15:05.879
You got a life.
Who am I to tell you what to do?

15:06.881 --> 15:09.098
Well, here's our
Martha Stewart blurb,

15:09.100 --> 15:12.601
all blown up and ready to roll
out and paste up on that wall.

15:12.603 --> 15:14.971
- Where's Ruth?
- She's in the kitchen.

15:14.973 --> 15:17.723
- I was just in there.
- Then she's in the bathroom.

15:17.725 --> 15:20.843
Oh, my God,
you're Haning me!

15:20.845 --> 15:23.178
She took a coffee break.

15:23.180 --> 15:26.315
What? She didn't need a break.
She just started 20 minutes ago.

15:26.317 --> 15:28.367
[Scoffs] Your rich
is really coming out,

15:28.369 --> 15:30.536
and it is not pretty.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.154
Forgot my phone.

15:32.156 --> 15:34.890
I mean, get it together,
Ruth, right?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.542
Watch and learn.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.462
Ruth, can you put the rat traps
down, one in each corner,

15:39.464 --> 15:42.248
and then you can get coffee
later after interning.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.532
Thanks.

15:43.934 --> 15:46.669
She's kind of a tool,
right?

15:49.856 --> 15:51.557
Max, were you
saying something?

15:51.559 --> 15:52.508
Nope.

15:52.510 --> 15:53.976
[Trap snaps]
Ouch!

15:53.978 --> 15:56.512
Right?

16:04.814 --> 16:06.564
Oh, look at this cage.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.851
I think my mom
used to dance in it.

16:11.253 --> 16:12.103
Here they are.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.989
These are the ones
I had the guy hold for us.

16:13.991 --> 16:17.141
Only $600 for all of them.
What do ya think, Daddy?

16:17.143 --> 16:20.945
I like 'em, doll.
Wrap 'em up.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.114
And can Daddy
get something he wants?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.333
So cute.
Over the counter?

16:25.335 --> 16:27.669
And that way when I'm
hungover and taking a nap,

16:27.671 --> 16:29.421
people can still
find the cupcakes.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.506
We could
have Ruth clean it

16:31.508 --> 16:33.008
and then paint
and reupholster these.

16:33.010 --> 16:34.342
By the way, where is she?

16:34.344 --> 16:36.327
She was supposed to
be here an hour ago.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.329
Text her and find out
where she is.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.016
Why are you so interested in
where she is, what she's doing?

16:41.018 --> 16:42.701
Are you obsessed with her?

16:42.703 --> 16:45.403
Max, I don't want to make
a purse out of her skin.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.138
I just want her
to do her job.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.441
Never mind.
I'll just text her.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.975
Well, be careful.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.111
Don't delete any
of my penis with a hat pictures.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.679
Even if I did,
it's not a big deal.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.981
Oleg will always pose again.

16:56.983 --> 17:00.652
Yeah, but I'll never get
that little pilgrim hat back.

17:00.654 --> 17:04.204
"Where are you?
We needed you here yesterday."

17:04.207 --> 17:06.458
All in caps,
'cause bosses talk in caps.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.544
[Coughs]
Total tool.

17:09.546 --> 17:11.212
[Phone chimes]
Look at that.

17:11.214 --> 17:13.631
Texted right back,
'cause I'm the boss.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.300
She says...

17:15.301 --> 17:17.752
Yesterday was super hard
so she's not feeling great

17:17.753 --> 17:19.704
and she can't come in today?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.473
[Scoffs]
That's it. She's fired.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.007
Here.
You have to fire her.

17:23.009 --> 17:26.444
She said she was sick,
Condé Nasty.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.147
She's not sick,
she's just taking advantage

17:29.149 --> 17:30.598
'cause you're
too friendly with her.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.233
She works for us.

17:32.235 --> 17:34.218
Yeah, for free.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.603
Why don't you just
hollow her out

17:35.605 --> 17:38.239
and live inside of her,
you monster?

17:38.241 --> 17:40.909
[Phone chimes]

17:40.911 --> 17:44.913
Um, I don't think
we were supposed to get this.

17:44.915 --> 17:47.499
"The dumb one wants me to pick
up all this crappy furniture.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.868
"Right? As if.

17:49.870 --> 17:52.787
I'll be at the bar in ten.
Order me a Bellini."

17:52.789 --> 17:54.506
Oh, who's the monster now?

17:54.508 --> 17:56.257
She just called you
the dumb one.

17:56.259 --> 17:59.094
Uh, she called you
the dumb one.

17:59.096 --> 18:01.463
It's your phone,
you're the dumb one.

18:01.465 --> 18:03.681
She knows I don't talk
in caps, so that's to you.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.016
You're the dumb one.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.351
- Fire her.
- No, you fire her.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.585
No, you fire her.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.354
No, you hired her,
you fire her.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.473
I wanted to go
with Molly big boobs.

18:11.475 --> 18:14.976
She'd be here right now
with four chairs on each boob.

18:14.978 --> 18:16.478
Why can't you
just fire her?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.229
It's clear she called you
the dumb one.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.615
All right, fine, I know
she called me the dumb one.

18:20.617 --> 18:23.935
But I can't fire her.
I want to, but there is a block.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.620
Right here.

18:25.622 --> 18:28.406
It comes up, and then goes,
"nope!" It goes right back down.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.292
I am not supposed to
fire someone.

18:31.294 --> 18:34.445
I am the someone
who's supposed to be fired.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.548
So I guess
I'm the boss, then.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.050
Sounds like a plan.
I'll be in my mom's cage.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.052
[Scoffs]

18:41.054 --> 18:43.421
All right, come on,
you lowly worker.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.456
Help the boss
pull these chairs out.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.026
Don't yell at me, boss.
I'm blocked.

18:48.028 --> 18:50.311
Wish you had your enemas now,
don't you?

18:52.898 --> 18:55.166
[Both screaming]

18:55.168 --> 18:57.735
They followed us!
We walked into a trap!

18:57.737 --> 18:59.187
It's a vendetta!

18:59.189 --> 19:00.638
Ugh, I can't believe this!

19:00.640 --> 19:01.990
Our intern's
out having cocktails

19:01.992 --> 19:03.441
and I'm trapped
on top of rat mountain!

19:03.443 --> 19:05.810
[Screams]
He's coming after me!

19:05.812 --> 19:08.229
Whoa--whoa!

19:08.231 --> 19:09.914
[Screams]
Oh, my God!

19:09.916 --> 19:12.417
Max! Help!

19:12.419 --> 19:15.152
No, you bastards!
Get off her!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.721
Aah!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.373
Get off!

19:18.375 --> 19:20.508
My foot's caught
under this thing!

19:20.510 --> 19:23.661
[Grunts]

19:23.663 --> 19:27.549
Aah!

19:28.051 --> 19:30.334
Max, that was amazing.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.271
You just lifted that
giant thing up with one hand.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.556
I know.

19:34.558 --> 19:37.810
And now I'm gonna
fire that bitch!

19:42.031 --> 19:45.567
Wow. You suck at this too.

19:46.069 --> 19:47.002
Sorry I'm late.

19:47.004 --> 19:48.903
I was having a dream
that I was sleeping in,

19:48.905 --> 19:51.990
then I woke up,
and I was.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.528
Who's the boss?

19:57.530 --> 19:59.163
Tony Danza?

19:59.165 --> 20:01.666
No, Max, who's the boss?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.885
I am.

20:04.387 --> 20:05.770
Have a seat, Ruth.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.204
Here?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.140
Good call.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.260
In addition to being a boss,

20:12.262 --> 20:13.895
I am also a waitress.

20:13.897 --> 20:16.547
But when I do my job,
I don't call people dumb.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.716
All right, I do, but at least
it's to their face.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.768
Oh, you're talking
about that thing?

20:20.770 --> 20:22.220
I meant Caroline.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.721
No, I know you meant me,

20:23.723 --> 20:26.357
because I'm not dumb
and neither is Caroline.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.559
And one thing I figured out
is that in business,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.394
maybe I have to be
a little more ruthless.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.248
Meaning no more Ruth.
You're fired.

20:33.250 --> 20:37.401
So, I'm not
getting college credit?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.504
I'll probably
get kicked out of school again,

20:39.506 --> 20:41.773
but no worries, right?

20:46.962 --> 20:49.246
I'm really proud of how
you stuck up for yourself.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.017
You're fired.
Sorry, I can't stop.

20:55.521 --> 20:56.554
Look, Max.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.141
We're on our way.

21:01.556 --> 21:06.141
