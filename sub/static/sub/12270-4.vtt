00:00.040 --> 00:02.560
Previously on The Evermoor Chronicles...

00:02.760 --> 00:06.000
My mother's son would be
the soulmate of the Supreme Everine.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.680
I'm the Supreme Everine.
I'll grant you any wish. Any second,

00:09.880 --> 00:11.600
you'll be reunited with your mom.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.280
Tara!
Cameron!

00:17.320 --> 00:20.920
# I left my friends for my new life #

00:21.040 --> 00:24.040
# How will I know
It's gonna be all right? #

00:24.200 --> 00:29.640
# I got to take control
And write my destiny #

00:29.840 --> 00:33.440
# The future's still untold #

00:33.560 --> 00:36.440
# Nobody else can see #

00:36.560 --> 00:42.640
# If this will be for Evermoor #

00:47.320 --> 00:49.000
Did I do it wrong?

00:49.160 --> 00:53.440
Why did he sprout a leaf?
(PANICKED) Tell me his mom’s a gardener!

00:53.560 --> 00:57.800
Tara, Cameron’s mum is the crying tree!
I know it sounds impossible but--

00:57.960 --> 01:01.440
She looked at me. The hermit
was talking to the tree and then--

01:01.560 --> 01:04.480
Another tree appeared?
How did you know?

01:05.480 --> 01:09.480
I magicked Cameron to be with his mom.
He’s a tree now too?

01:09.640 --> 01:13.600
Okay. Oh, boy, okay-- I need--

01:13.800 --> 01:14.800
Is he okay?

01:14.960 --> 01:18.880
I believe his world is crashing down.
I should get him water or something.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.960
I don’t need a glass of water!
I need a scientific explanation.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.000
I need to figure it out.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.000
I need to be alone.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.440
How did he look? Cameron?

01:33.560 --> 01:35.040
He’s a tree!

01:38.760 --> 01:42.680
(RADIO) The temperature today
will be warm. Not too warm.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.040
Warmer than a clammy hand,
but cooler than a light bulb.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.080
The time now is... (EXHALES)

01:55.480 --> 01:58.800
(RADIO STATIC)

02:02.640 --> 02:04.120
(DIALS PHONE)

02:05.840 --> 02:07.480
Is he all right?

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
I see.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.640
I see.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.680
Okay.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.120
DJ Old Man Snow has retired.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.280
We’ll have to replace him.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.200
The silence is already killing me.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.520
We’ll do it!
You should get that printed on a T-shirt.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.840
I can guarantee he won’t stop talking.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.760

(BEAR VOICE) Weww hawwow widdle, Tawa,
wemember me?

02:47.200 --> 02:50.560
Drifty?
I found him in a box

02:50.760 --> 02:54.640
of stuff you left behind
that summer you came to stay.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.640
Are you okay?
I thought I’d lost him forever.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.680
I thought you’d forgotten about him.
He looked like a busted mattress,

03:01.880 --> 03:04.640
but I repaired him good as new.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.080
(TSK)

03:07.160 --> 03:09.600
You guys were inseparable.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.080
I’d do anything to be back there again.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.840
You couldn’t go to sleep
without that little guy. Remember?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.440
He used to play this lullaby.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.400
(MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING)

03:25.520 --> 03:30.040
Where’s Cameron?
(MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING)

03:33.840 --> 03:37.000
Uh, he went home. Why?
(BELLA SNIFFS)

03:37.160 --> 03:39.440
What are you doing?

03:39.560 --> 03:42.520
(SNIFFS) Tara,
something happened last night.

03:42.680 --> 03:47.200
I think the Night of the Stench switched
something on in me. Some kind of power.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.000
Power?
I don’t know.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.760
I think I can smell feelings. Like,
it’s not perfect, but I’m sensing from you

03:54.920 --> 03:58.640
something really bad about Cameron
or Carmen or Karen.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.880
Don’t know a Karen or Carmen.
And Cameron’s fine, okay?

04:30.400 --> 04:35.320
(MALE VOICE) Oh, I see,
just gonna leave me again. Fine.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.640
Hey, princess. It’s your old pal!

04:41.840 --> 04:46.840
What happened to you, princess?
You’re all swolled up.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.680
What happened to me?
What happened to you?!

04:52.880 --> 04:56.280
(WHISPERS) Ah, golden thread.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.520
This stuff should be called
golden problems.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.280
You want to go play? I’ve been cooped up
for so long, I’ll even play dress-up!

05:04.440 --> 05:06.160
Shh! Will you keep it down?

05:06.360 --> 05:10.760
You used to be my best friend!
And then you went and left me.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.480
(SIGHS) Okay, we’ll go play!
Really?

05:20.280 --> 05:23.120
(DRIFTY)
So how could you forget to pack me?

05:23.320 --> 05:26.640
I don’t know how I forgot,
I don’t really remember my time here.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.480
You really should
lock that golden thread away.

05:29.640 --> 05:34.360
Did you replace me?
(GRUNTS) What with?

05:34.480 --> 05:38.600
Not a doll! Don’t, don’t say a doll.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.480
Sarah.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.840
Is that Cameron?

05:56.480 --> 06:00.680
Hey! What kind of playing is this?
When are we gonna sing songs?

06:00.880 --> 06:02.680
(GRUNTS)

06:02.880 --> 06:06.440
The touch of the thread restores all.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.440
I was afraid of this.

06:13.560 --> 06:17.400
The touch of the thread applies
to the rotten or the lost.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.440
Technically, Cameron is alive and well.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.960
The only way to undo his spell is to undo
Sarah’s. And the only way to undo that

06:25.080 --> 06:28.520
is find the curse that turned her
into a tree in the first place.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.560
Except no one knows what that is.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.040
I’m sorry.

06:38.200 --> 06:43.400
(LAUGHS) Don’t get all sappynow.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.040
(LAUGHS) Get it?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.680
Because he’s a tree! (LAUGHS)

06:57.160 --> 06:59.440
Mom really was tired.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.840
Hey, you want to go run through a field?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.800
I don’t do that kind of thing
anymore, Drifty.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.600
Well, what do you do then,
Little Miss All Growed Up?

07:09.800 --> 07:14.280
(GASPS) That’s it!
Cameron’s mom disappeared right before

07:14.440 --> 07:18.360
we arrived that summer, Drifty,
and that’s the weaving that did it to her.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.000
(SURPRISED) That’s the curse!

07:21.160 --> 07:24.760
Tara. I’m glad you’re here.
I think I figured it out.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.600
Really?
Yeah. You know how when Cotton Lively

07:27.800 --> 07:30.560
came out of the tapestry,
it made her more magical?

07:30.760 --> 07:32.680
Uh, yeah?
I think when I came out,

07:32.880 --> 07:36.360
it did something to me too.
We’ll talk about this later.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.400

07:54.400 --> 07:57.680
Evermoor FM doesn’t have that many songs.
We have a Top Two.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.280

and 52 minutes?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.560
The Ask Jake & Ludo Show.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.080
Ask Jake and Ludo what?
It’s an advice show.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.120
People ring up with their problems
and we solve them.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.880
Hey, I remember this.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.280
Tara used to take it everywhere with her.
(MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING)

08:18.440 --> 08:21.400
If that’s not the jingle
for The Ask Jake & Ludo Show,

08:21.600 --> 08:23.280
I don’t know what is.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.000
I found Sarah.
Oh?

08:31.160 --> 08:33.800
Someone turned her into a tree,
Aunt Bridget.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.600
I’ve done the same to Cameron!

08:35.760 --> 08:38.600
But I think I’ve figured out a way
to get them back.

08:38.760 --> 08:43.280
Remember taking this? That’s the curse
that turned her into a tree, right?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.960
I think you might be right.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.120
Well, now that we know
what did it, I can undo it, right?

08:49.280 --> 08:52.920
If we turn Sarah back,
Cameron will come back too.

08:53.040 --> 08:57.560
It’s a perfect plan.
Except for the fact the symbol is cut off.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.360
Only a little bit. We could guess.

09:01.560 --> 09:06.000
Get one stitch wrong and you destroy
any hope of recovering anybody.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.600
Uh. I got to go.
I have a toy with abandonment issues.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.200
Tara! This book says weird stuff
has being happening in this place

09:24.360 --> 09:25.600
for a thousand years.

09:25.760 --> 09:31.760
If you believe this, one year they had
a sausage storm! It rained sausages, Tara!

09:31.920 --> 09:34.320
Did he say anything to you?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.440
Doesn’t matter.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.200
Jake and Ludo asked me
to record the bear for a jingle.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.560
(MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING)

09:45.720 --> 09:50.760
Seb, I need to use that big brain of yours
to figure out how to fix Cameron.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.040
Seb?

09:55.560 --> 09:56.560
Seb?

09:58.720 --> 10:01.800
You’re not gonna wake him, princess.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.520
I was just so jazzed to see you again.
I didn’t want to ruin it.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.800
Ruin it with what?

10:07.960 --> 10:13.600
Well, see, this special thread
your mom fixed me with?

10:13.760 --> 10:19.080
Not only does it make me talk,
but my lullaby sends people to sleep...

10:20.320 --> 10:22.280
(WHISPERS) forever.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.440
See, my lullaby sends people to sleep,
forever.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.240
It’s not as bad as it sounds.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.800
The sleeping makes them dream
all their memories, all at once.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.920
It’s really kind of pleasant.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.680

10:38.840 --> 10:42.880
Mom. She heard it, didn’t she?
And the blonde too.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.080
What, where are we going?

10:47.240 --> 10:50.760
You’re giving me to the dog, aren’t you?
I need advice.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.360
And there’s only one place to get it.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.680
Hey, Seb, you finished yet?

Pull the golden thread out of the muskrat.

It’ll lift the curse. Everyone wakes up.
What? No! I’ll lose my voice!

you dream your memories, all at once!

If I put myself to sleep, I could remember
the rest of that symbol in the picture.

there’d be no way to wake up.

17:57.280 --> 18:02.960
It was me. I turned Sarah into a tree.
And I don’t know why.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.920
Did you get the symbol?

18:10.320 --> 18:16.360
Now we can reverse the tree spell, right?
But it’s very complicated.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.040
If I get a stitch wrong,
are they lost forever?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.640
I’m sure you’ll do fine.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.200
Like I’ve done fine so far?

18:28.360 --> 18:33.440
Aunt Bridget, I’ve caused plagues and rips
and turned people into horrible things.

18:33.640 --> 18:38.400
I’ve only ever made a mess of my magic.
Perhaps-- No. It’s silly.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.360
What?

18:40.560 --> 18:43.560
Well, what if I turned
Sarah and Cameron back?

18:43.720 --> 18:46.600
Only those with the Supreme powers
can sew the symbol.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.600
Exactly.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.960
I can transfer my powers! It’s perfect.
You’d become mortal again.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.760
No more powers.
I don’t care.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.680
I’m dangerous, Aunt Bridget. I can’t
be allowed to hurt people any more.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.600
Very well.

19:06.600 --> 19:13.000
These will transfer
your Supreme essence to me.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.520
Here goes nothing.

19:48.880 --> 19:53.080
Okay, let’s get Cameron and Sarah back!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.720
No.

19:57.880 --> 20:03.320
Why would I do that when I was the one
who put them there in the first place?

20:03.520 --> 20:09.560
Yes, it was you who turned Sarah
into a tree with my encouragement.

20:09.720 --> 20:13.120
The fake death, training,

20:13.280 --> 20:18.720
everything--
Was all to get to this moment.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.600
The moment I take
the Supreme powers for myself.

20:23.760 --> 20:28.560
And rule Evermoor!

20:31.120 --> 20:33.760
(NARRATOR)
Next time on The Evermoor Chronicles.

20:33.920 --> 20:38.040
I gave my powers away to someone
whose plan was to steal them all along.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.880
You've broken every scared vow
of the Everines.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
(BRIDGET)
Evermoor will be changed forever!
