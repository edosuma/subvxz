00:05.392 --> 00:07.292
Do you hear that? I can't find my phone.

00:07.394 --> 00:09.260
I think it's coming from the fruit bowl.

00:09.329 --> 00:11.329
(DINGING CONTINUES)

00:13.300 --> 00:15.333
Oh, no.

00:15.402 --> 00:17.335
(DINGING CONTINUES)

00:18.972 --> 00:20.638
I've been doing sleep magic again.

00:20.707 --> 00:21.706
(DINGING STOPS)

00:21.775 --> 00:23.208
You look like you haven't slept at all.

00:23.276 --> 00:24.876
Maybe an hour or two a night.

00:24.945 --> 00:26.411
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING:

00:26.513 --> 00:28.813
warm shower before bed, meditation,

00:28.882 --> 00:31.216
reading my operating
system's user agreement.

00:31.251 --> 00:33.384
Did you try asking Alex about
the struggles that are unique

00:33.453 --> 00:34.519
to women in science?

00:34.588 --> 00:36.721
Late last night.
I think she's still going.

00:36.823 --> 00:38.490
It's the worst possible timing.

00:38.558 --> 00:40.325
I have a video shoot
for a big listing today,

00:40.393 --> 00:41.526
and I'm supposed to be on camera.

00:41.628 --> 00:42.861
I gotta go.

00:42.963 --> 00:44.629
Dad, your keys.

00:45.665 --> 00:46.598
(KEYS CLANK)

00:46.700 --> 00:48.566
You know what? I'll drive.

00:50.570 --> 00:51.669
Good luck with your interview.

00:51.771 --> 00:54.873
Oh, you know what?
I decided to pass on that.

00:54.975 --> 00:56.040
Why?

00:56.142 --> 00:58.476
That's an amazing job,
and you were so excited.

00:58.578 --> 01:01.045
I think I was flattered.

01:01.147 --> 01:03.248
Like when you go to a bar
and a guy sends you a drink.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.850
I'm at the leading scientific
university in the country.

01:05.952 --> 01:07.986
Those guys can't even look
their robots in the eye.

01:08.088 --> 01:11.523
I was asked to interview for
CEO of Uncle Ned's Cookies,

01:11.625 --> 01:14.025
a major player in the
snack food industry.

01:14.127 --> 01:15.827
The position opened up
because it turns out

01:15.929 --> 01:18.563
Uncle Ned liked to play
fast and loose with...

01:18.665 --> 01:20.398
his genitals at work.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.634
Mom, you need to take that interview.

01:22.736 --> 01:26.004
Now that they're purging male creeps
from executive positions,

01:26.106 --> 01:29.173
strong women are finally
getting their seat at the table.

01:29.276 --> 01:31.075
Honey, I already have
a seat at the table.

01:31.177 --> 01:32.977
In fact, at the head of the table.

01:33.079 --> 01:34.279
You mean when Grandpa's not there?

01:34.381 --> 01:35.547
Tables have two heads.

01:35.649 --> 01:38.116
I'm only bringing out
my trademark hard truths

01:38.218 --> 01:39.384
because I don't want you to pass up

01:39.486 --> 01:42.520
an amazing opportunity in
deference to the patriarchy.

01:42.622 --> 01:45.523
Honey, I have a lot of amazing
opportunities at my current job.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.859
And isn't Uncle Ned's
basically just stoner food?

01:47.961 --> 01:49.093
We love Uncle Ned's!

01:49.195 --> 01:50.361
I miss those.

01:50.463 --> 01:52.196
(GROANS)

01:52.299 --> 01:54.332
Thank you for your concern,
but I'll be fine.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.568
Maybe I'm just projecting
my own frustrations

01:56.670 --> 01:58.036
with the science world.

01:58.138 --> 02:00.672
You know, there are only
three female PhDs...

- She's locked herself in the bathroom.

build that outhouse?

W-What is going on with her?

S-She's been so moody recently,

02:32.405 --> 02:34.272
screaming one minute, crying the next.

02:34.374 --> 02:36.808
You know what?
I think I know what this might be.

O-Oh?

02:38.144 --> 02:41.112
She had a volcano due
in science class today,

02:41.214 --> 02:42.880
and when I was her age
and had a big project,

02:42.983 --> 02:44.515
I'd get stressed out
and act just like this.

02:44.618 --> 02:47.785
You know, I still have nightmares about
my War of Northern Aggression diorama.

02:47.887 --> 02:49.320
Okay. What did we say
when we got married?

Never go to bed angry

see how far she's gotten.

Okay, Lily, honey, come on.
Come out, all right?

02:56.463 --> 02:58.296
We can help you fix your volcano,

02:58.398 --> 03:00.198
and... and you'll still
make it to school.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.299
Worst comes to worst,

03:01.401 --> 03:03.034
you'll be a little late
for your first period.

she's a little early.

03:04.704 --> 03:05.603
Hm?

03:05.705 --> 03:06.504
So...

03:06.606 --> 03:07.739
Lily is a menstruator now.

03:07.841 --> 03:08.873
That's not what you call it.

03:08.975 --> 03:10.108
Well, I'm just ashamed to admit

03:10.210 --> 03:11.676
that we never really
prepared her for it.

03:11.778 --> 03:13.778
Hey, we tried that one time.

03:16.082 --> 03:17.682
- Hey, girl. Hey!
- Hey!

03:17.784 --> 03:20.084
So, sweetie,
Daddy and I were wondering if,

03:20.186 --> 03:22.086
now that you're wearing a training bra,

03:22.188 --> 03:25.289
if you had any other questions
about your changing body.

03:25.392 --> 03:26.290
Can we just not?

03:26.393 --> 03:27.925
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, perfect.

03:28.028 --> 03:30.828
I thought you were gonna ask Claire
to talk to Lily about this.

03:30.930 --> 03:33.064
Well, I was, but when I tried,
Claire was in such a mood,

03:33.166 --> 03:34.399
because, ironically...

03:34.501 --> 03:37.635
Okay, we can't screw this up.
We cannot give her a complex.

03:37.737 --> 03:40.438
(SIGHS) Okay,
you see if you can track down Claire.

03:40.540 --> 03:41.839
I will go to the pharmacy

03:41.941 --> 03:44.308
and try and conquer my fear
of the feminine care aisle.

03:44.411 --> 03:45.843
(GROANS) Poor Lily.

03:45.945 --> 03:47.211
You know, it could be worse.

dealing with this every 17 days.

that while I'm gone.

03:55.422 --> 03:57.255
Our blankets are folded into triangles,

03:57.357 --> 03:58.890
we do a left tuck,

03:58.992 --> 04:00.091
a toe tuck,

04:00.193 --> 04:01.292
a right tuck,

04:01.394 --> 04:03.661
and voilà, baby burrito.

04:03.763 --> 04:05.596

04:05.699 --> 04:07.598
I guess that summer
working at Burrito Basement

04:07.701 --> 04:08.866
was worth the E.coli.

Dylan and I have been
taking a baby care class.

04:11.705 --> 04:13.871
It's frustrating, because
even though he's missed some,

04:13.973 --> 04:14.972
he's crushing it.

04:15.075 --> 04:16.339
The class, not the practice doll.

(CLEARS THROAT) That was me.

do we have to get down for today?

04:21.482 --> 04:22.958
- Burping.
- Great!

04:23.050 --> 04:26.822
- A bur-bur-burp. Boom. What's next?
- Hold on, Mom.

04:26.853 --> 04:29.987
Do you remember the four other methods
in case over-the-shoulder doesn't work?

04:30.090 --> 04:32.523
Uh, was one scare 'em?

over-the-knee,

Grandmother's burp, and the bounce burp.

04:37.063 --> 04:39.363
Ugh. Why do I suck at this?

I know it's overwhelming,
but you're gonna get there.

04:50.477 --> 04:53.144
I went on the company website,
and somebody left off

04:53.213 --> 04:55.580
the brushed brass upgrade
on the Executive Premiere.

04:55.682 --> 04:57.415
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I eighty-sixed that.

04:57.484 --> 04:58.583
I already signed off on it.

04:58.651 --> 05:00.384

to double-check with me.

You know,
I do have 30 years' experience.

05:02.889 --> 05:04.956
Closet Time Magazine once called me

05:05.024 --> 05:08.359
"The Neil Armstrong of

05:08.428 --> 05:10.128
Okay, Dad, you work two days a week,

05:10.196 --> 05:12.363
and you spent the entire
last staff meeting

05:12.432 --> 05:13.564
doodling a pineapple.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.600
How about this...
take the helm on the Berkshire line.

05:15.702 --> 05:16.934
I discontinued that.

05:17.036 --> 05:18.803
Yeah, but then Jeff cornered
me in the men's room,

05:18.905 --> 05:20.171
and I relaunched it.

05:20.273 --> 05:23.341
Okay, Dad, you are putting me

05:23.409 --> 05:25.610
in an impossible position.

05:25.712 --> 05:28.479
I make decisions, and then
you go around undermining them.

05:28.548 --> 05:30.848
Everybody values your
opinions around here, Claire.

05:30.950 --> 05:32.717
In fact,
I'd like your opinion right now.

05:32.819 --> 05:34.685
Does this look like an igloo?

05:36.222 --> 05:38.389

wants me to be their CEO.

05:49.702 --> 05:51.936
and not just the boss's daughter.

05:52.038 --> 05:53.738
Is this the part where I apologize

05:53.840 --> 05:57.408
for handing you a company
Closet Fancy once called "top shelf"?!

05:57.510 --> 05:59.977
No, this is the part
where I take an interview

06:00.079 --> 06:03.381
with people who actually
recognize my value!

06:04.818 --> 06:05.917
Damn whisper slides.

Okay.

06:13.338 --> 06:15.605

06:15.707 --> 06:16.740
It was totally overwhelming.

06:16.775 --> 06:18.208

as much as I could.

variety packs...

sounded kind of cute.

06:24.249 --> 06:25.115
Mm.

06:25.184 --> 06:26.483
So, what are we supposed to do?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.885

in there and wish her good luck.

Is that Claire? Did you reach her?

06:31.924 --> 06:35.592
No, she wasn't answering,
so I... I called for backup.

Thank you for including
me in this special time.

our Lily's blossoming!

you helping us out.

06:42.768 --> 06:44.000
Of course.

06:44.069 --> 06:46.536
This is when it's good to
have a woman in the house.

06:46.605 --> 06:50.841
Not that two men raising a daughter
is unnatural in any way.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.409
Pretty sure no one was thinking that.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.610
(DOORBELL RINGS)

06:53.679 --> 06:55.145
Sorry... I-I panicked
and sent a group text

06:55.247 --> 06:57.447
because I didn't know who would respond.

06:57.516 --> 06:59.416
Hey. I brought Lily some pamphlets.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.184
Understanding the biology
will help make her

07:01.286 --> 07:03.053
more comfortable with her menses.

07:03.155 --> 07:06.223
Mensies? How is that
not a gay bar for little men?

07:06.291 --> 07:08.191
- We should...
- We're not buying another domain name.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.826
She doesn't need pamphlets.

07:09.895 --> 07:11.528
She needs love and support.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.263
It's a beautiful rite of passage

07:13.332 --> 07:15.866
that is going to connect her
with women everywhere.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.001
Let's not get poetic.
It hurts like hell.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.137
And that's why I brought
all the ingredients

07:20.205 --> 07:23.340
to make her a traditional
Colombian period poultice,

07:23.408 --> 07:26.076
and she can rub it on her belly
when she gets cramps.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.777
Or she could just take some ibuprofen.

07:27.846 --> 07:29.813
Oh, but is that going to
draw out all of her sins?

07:29.882 --> 07:32.449
'Cause that's why women get
their period in the first place.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.318

Two equally worthy paths.

07:35.387 --> 07:37.287

toward the pamphlet.

Oh, great... more voices.

I have two fetuses
kicking me in the bladder,

07:45.297 --> 07:46.496

Okay, well,
Larry's litter box is on the porch.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.667

You can't ask her to go outside

- and squat ov...

08:05.617 --> 08:06.650
global warming...

08:06.718 --> 08:08.118
Back up, back up, back up.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.186
Which toe is numb?

08:09.254 --> 08:11.188
Left foot. The one that goes to market.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.356
And why are you worried about Haley?

08:13.425 --> 08:16.693
At her baby class,
she did not seem ready.

08:17.450 --> 08:19.262
I'm kind of glad Dylan
had to work today.

08:19.364 --> 08:20.797
I'm excited to see what you've learned.

08:20.866 --> 08:24.134
Okay, everybody.
Quick review before we start.

08:24.203 --> 08:27.137
At what age can you first
give babies solid food?

08:27.206 --> 08:28.905
- TOGETHER: Six months.
- Two years!

08:28.974 --> 08:31.441
And when you put baby down to sleep,
you place him on his...

08:31.510 --> 08:32.741
- TOGETHER: Back.
- Mattress.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.544
And the fontanelle is...

08:34.613 --> 08:37.581
- TOGETHER: Soft spot.
- A hotel in Miami?

08:37.649 --> 08:39.916
(BRITISH ACCENT) Phil.
You ready to sell a house?

08:40.018 --> 08:41.985
Yes. Yes. Let's do this.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.120
Uh, Desmond, this is my director, Luke.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.121
I'm your son.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.562
Aww. You always will be.

08:47.597 --> 08:48.558
Ohh!

08:49.661 --> 08:52.062
- Dad.
- Desmond is the brains

08:52.130 --> 08:55.298
behind the best high-end
real-estate walkthrough videos.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.434
He's helped move more houses than, um...

08:57.536 --> 08:58.969
than, uh...

08:59.037 --> 09:02.372
What's the... What's the crack
that... causes all the earthquakes?

09:02.441 --> 09:03.440
The San Andreas fault.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.242
(LAUGHS)

09:05.344 --> 09:06.943
That's funny.

09:07.012 --> 09:09.713
So, to recap our discussion,

09:09.781 --> 09:11.381
we'll start with the camera
coming down the walk.

09:11.483 --> 09:14.718
You open the door, say
"Welcome to 15683 Canyon Ridge Drive,

09:14.786 --> 09:17.354
a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom,
8,600 square-foot home

09:17.456 --> 09:19.189
in the prestigious 90212 ZIP code."

09:19.258 --> 09:21.224
- Ah.
- You got it?

09:21.293 --> 09:23.960
15683, 15683...

09:24.029 --> 09:25.095
I got it.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.497
DESMOND: Good. Let's try one.

09:27.599 --> 09:28.732
Here we go.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.367
Ready, and...

09:30.435 --> 09:31.301
action.

09:32.323 --> 09:35.505
15683.

09:37.809 --> 09:39.142
- Cut.
- Moving on?

09:39.211 --> 09:40.176
N-No.

09:40.245 --> 09:42.279
No, that wasn't right at all.

09:42.347 --> 09:44.948
Um... pretty sure it was.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.249
Phil.

09:46.351 --> 09:47.851
You've got to do the whole thing.

09:47.953 --> 09:48.952
Oh.

09:49.054 --> 09:50.854
Oh, yes. Yeah, of course.

09:50.956 --> 09:51.721
Yeah.

09:51.823 --> 09:52.822
All right.

09:52.924 --> 09:55.125
Back to one.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.294
Ready, and...

09:57.362 --> 09:58.528
action.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.799
(SNORING)

10:04.403 --> 10:05.502
Thank you.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.537
Claire! Thanks for coming in.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.272
I'm Ben. This is my brother, Evan.

10:09.374 --> 10:10.106
Hi.

10:10.175 --> 10:11.408
Our dad's Uncle Ned.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.043
But we just call him Dad. (CHUCKLES)

10:13.111 --> 10:14.711
We are so happy you're here.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.813
Well, thank you so much for having me.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.783
And can I say...
it smells amazing in here!

10:19.885 --> 10:21.518
It's the cookies.

10:21.620 --> 10:22.919
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

10:22.988 --> 10:24.354
We are so very impressed

10:24.423 --> 10:26.923
with what your closet company
has done, fiscally speaking.

10:26.992 --> 10:29.726
Well, to be fair, my dad
is the one who built the business.

10:29.828 --> 10:30.960
We can relate to that.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.462
But we mean since you joined.

10:32.531 --> 10:35.031
Many people are saying that's
when it really took off.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.567
It is so nice to be recognized.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.970
I... I see tremendous growth
potential in this company.

10:41.039 --> 10:42.238
We think so.

10:42.307 --> 10:44.474
That is, with the right captain
steering the ship,

10:44.576 --> 10:46.076
fiscally speaking.

10:46.178 --> 10:50.313
Which is why we're prepared
to offer you a big salary,

10:50.382 --> 10:51.614
stock stuff...

10:51.683 --> 10:53.750
And all the cookies you can eat.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.577
I didn't expect this
to be going so fast.

10:57.612 --> 10:59.889
- Um...
- Well, we're kind of on a clock.

10:59.958 --> 11:03.293
You see, the IRS has called
some of our bookkeeping...

11:03.395 --> 11:05.195
"flagrantly illegal."

11:05.263 --> 11:06.363
How could that happen?

11:06.431 --> 11:08.598
We were hoping you could tell us.

11:09.534 --> 11:11.234
We don't know anything about business.

11:11.336 --> 11:12.535
- Fiscally speaking?
- Yeah.

11:12.604 --> 11:13.703
- Mm.
- Exactly.

11:13.772 --> 11:15.305
That was kind of our dad's thing.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.209
Also, making them, selling them,
all that other stuff.

11:19.277 --> 11:22.712
Just to be clear,
what are your roles here?

11:22.814 --> 11:24.714
We used to taste the cookies,

11:24.816 --> 11:26.716
but now we're chairmen of the board.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.885
I see.

11:28.954 --> 11:33.089
As such, we are legally bound to mention
a little situation we have with the FDA.

11:33.191 --> 11:34.591
Thanks to Evan,

11:34.693 --> 11:37.594
we keep failing something called
the "hairs-per-million test."

11:37.662 --> 11:40.897
And due to the videotaped
evidence against our father,

11:40.966 --> 11:44.000
we need a highly qualified
woman such as yourself

11:44.069 --> 11:46.736
to testify in front of Congress.

11:46.838 --> 11:47.837
Hmm.

11:47.906 --> 11:50.673
Uh... guys, this is a lot to take in.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.210
Well, I think we know what that means.

11:54.312 --> 11:55.378
Yeah.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.213
Welcome to Uncle Ned's.

12:02.554 --> 12:05.789
Whether you're a bachelor,
a couple, or a flamily...

12:05.857 --> 12:08.525
(LAUGHING) "Flamily"...
I just said "flamily."

12:09.461 --> 12:10.960
Wait, is it "flamily"?

12:11.062 --> 12:11.995
DESMOND: All right.

12:12.097 --> 12:13.530
Let's just take it from,

12:13.598 --> 12:16.800
"This is modern California
living at its finest."

12:16.902 --> 12:18.668
And action.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.638
(BRITISH ACCENT) This is modern
California living at its finest.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.773
Stop! You're doing
the British accent again.

12:23.842 --> 12:26.242
I'm not hearing it!

12:26.344 --> 12:27.477
And action.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.746
(NORMAL VOICE) You'll
have state-of-the-art...

12:29.815 --> 12:31.614
(VOICE BREAKING) appliances...

12:31.716 --> 12:33.583
I'm sorry. I got this.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.084
(INHALES SHARPLY)

12:35.153 --> 12:37.053
(SOBBING)

12:40.258 --> 12:42.625
Imagine life from this perspective.

12:42.727 --> 12:44.194
That thing is gonna hit me!

12:44.296 --> 12:47.163
And best of all,
the entire house is fully automated.

12:47.265 --> 12:49.399
You can turn on the gorgeous
fountains right from your phone.

12:49.501 --> 12:50.533
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)

12:52.003 --> 12:53.636
Shoot. They're not working.

12:53.738 --> 12:55.505
Hey, I can feel my toe!

12:55.574 --> 12:59.008
And this one is about
hormonal fluctuations

12:59.077 --> 13:01.478
that can cause radical mood swings.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.080
One minute, you're totally fine,
and then the next,

13:04.149 --> 13:05.949
- you're just...
- LILY: Go home, nerd!

13:07.052 --> 13:08.651
...lashing out when someone
is trying to help you.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.819
Okay, well, thank you for helping,

13:09.888 --> 13:11.087
and don't take it personally.

13:11.189 --> 13:13.089
At least now we know why
she called my signature cuffs

13:13.158 --> 13:15.091
tackier than the Debbie Reynolds museum.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.126
Y-Yes, that was definitely
the hormones talking.

13:17.195 --> 13:19.829
Look, everyone's taking this
whole thing way too seriously.

13:19.931 --> 13:21.397
When my daughter has
her first Shark Week,

13:21.466 --> 13:22.832
we're just gonna laugh about it.

13:22.934 --> 13:24.033
That's what girls want.

13:24.135 --> 13:26.836
I mean, it is bananas
what happens down there every month.

13:26.905 --> 13:29.305
Only good thing is,
it reminds me to pay my bills.

13:29.374 --> 13:31.608
Oh, that's why my credit
card keeps getting denied.

13:31.676 --> 13:33.443
Hey, if there's somewhere
you need to be...

13:33.545 --> 13:35.044
- Just watch this.
- Mm.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.348
Hey, bitch.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.382
LILY: Haley's here?!

13:39.451 --> 13:40.917
That's right. And cheer up.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.353
You're missing the whole
silver lining in all of this.

13:43.421 --> 13:47.524
A period is a Get Out Of Jail Free card
for everything.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.758
Didn't study for a test?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.693
"Oh, wah. I have cramps."

13:50.795 --> 13:51.995
Don't want to go to gym class?

13:52.097 --> 13:53.796
"Sorry... lady problems."

13:53.899 --> 13:56.299
Wanna eat a whole sheet cake?
Shut down a bad date?

13:56.401 --> 13:58.434
Smuggle some weed into a
concert in your tampon box?

13:58.503 --> 13:59.536
Ain't nobody looking in there.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.004
What is wrong with you?!

14:01.106 --> 14:03.072
That's the advice you want
to give your daughter?!

14:03.174 --> 14:04.941
I know! I'm a disaster!

14:05.043 --> 14:08.011
How am I going to be a mother?
I can't even make a swaddle!

14:08.113 --> 14:10.213
I'm gonna raise a couple losers,
just like me!

14:10.315 --> 14:12.348
It's not your fault, you sweet dummies!

14:12.905 --> 14:14.017
Lily!

14:14.119 --> 14:15.652
LILY: Oh, my God. You too?

14:16.227 --> 14:18.321
I made you a Colombian poultice.

14:18.423 --> 14:20.590
Is that what stinks?
It's making me sick!

14:20.692 --> 14:22.258
We're gonna rub it all over your belly,

14:22.360 --> 14:23.593
and it's gonna make you feel better.

14:23.695 --> 14:26.529
It's also not terrible
on toast with a fried egg.

14:26.631 --> 14:28.398
- (GAGS)
- How many people are out there?!

14:28.500 --> 14:30.633
Just a few supportive women.

14:30.735 --> 14:31.968
Hello, sisters.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.603
I must've texted the wrong thread.

14:33.705 --> 14:35.672
Allow me to talk to the Earth Goddess.

14:35.774 --> 14:36.839
- U-Um...
- (CLEARS THROAT)

14:36.942 --> 14:39.776
Lily? Step-Uncle Manny's here.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.010
Cherish this.

14:41.112 --> 14:43.513
You've been given
the ability to create life.

14:43.615 --> 14:46.215
Each cramp, each migraine
should remind you...

14:46.318 --> 14:48.484
LILY: Get the (BLEEP) out of here,
Manny!

14:50.221 --> 14:51.421
Take care, everybody.

14:51.523 --> 14:52.789
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

14:55.072 --> 14:57.367
JAY: Claire, get in here.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.670
How'd the interview go?

14:59.772 --> 15:00.704
Amazing.

15:00.773 --> 15:03.307
First of all,
that place smells delicious.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.342
They made me an offer on the spot.

15:05.444 --> 15:07.744
CEO, travel...

15:07.847 --> 15:09.713
hobnobbing with Congressmen.

15:09.815 --> 15:11.248
Well, I'm not surprised.

15:11.350 --> 15:12.816
You're a terrific candidate.

15:14.019 --> 15:15.252
I turned them down.

15:15.728 --> 15:16.487
Why?

15:16.555 --> 15:18.789
Well, first of all,
because I made a commitment

15:18.858 --> 15:20.157
to everyone here and to you.

15:20.259 --> 15:23.427
And it just...
didn't feel right to leave.

15:23.496 --> 15:25.963
That makes what I'm
about to say awkward.

15:26.899 --> 15:27.898
I'm quitting.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.300
Oh, wha... You're that mad at me?

15:30.402 --> 15:32.803
No, I listened to what you said,

15:32.872 --> 15:34.671
and you're never truly
gonna be in charge

15:34.740 --> 15:36.140
until I get out of your way.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.508
You didn't have to do that for me.

15:37.610 --> 15:38.742
I didn't do it just for you.

15:38.844 --> 15:41.011
Every good closet man
knows when to hang it up.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.547
And I... I think
I'm ready for a new challenge.

15:43.616 --> 15:45.415
Oh, Dad, not window tinting.

15:45.484 --> 15:48.752
It's like printing money,
but no, it's not for me.

15:48.854 --> 15:50.454
Here's what I'm excited about.

15:50.523 --> 15:52.256
Let me show you. Mm.

15:54.193 --> 15:55.359
What am I looking at?

15:55.427 --> 15:56.593
The future.

15:56.662 --> 15:58.629
Fun dog beds.

15:58.697 --> 16:01.198
Oh, my God. This is
the pineapple you were doodling.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.233
Yes! I designed it myself!

16:03.335 --> 16:05.002
Cool. Cool.

16:05.104 --> 16:07.804
So, the pharmacy tracks how all
of your medications interact, right?

16:07.907 --> 16:09.673
(CHUCKLES) Claire, every year,

16:09.742 --> 16:13.577
people in this country spend
$70 billion on their pets.

16:13.679 --> 16:14.945
People or just you?

16:15.014 --> 16:16.346
I got a manufacturer lined up.

16:16.415 --> 16:18.248
I'll sell them online,
keep the overhead low,

16:18.317 --> 16:20.384
go to a bunch of dog shows... super fun.

16:20.452 --> 16:23.187
And if I don't lose all
the money that I made

16:23.255 --> 16:25.923
selling my share of this place,

16:25.991 --> 16:27.124
I'm happy.

16:27.226 --> 16:28.258
Wow.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.893
It's kind of the end of an era, huh?

16:30.963 --> 16:32.496
Are you sure you want to do this?

16:32.565 --> 16:34.865
I'd have quit years ago
if you weren't here.

16:36.101 --> 16:37.701
It's gonna be weird
coming to work without you.

16:37.770 --> 16:39.036
Well, if you miss me too much,

16:39.104 --> 16:42.372
there'll always be a position
for you at Dog Beds by Stella.

16:42.441 --> 16:45.876
Thank you, but I think maybe it is time
I prove myself on my own.

16:45.945 --> 16:47.811
You sure? 'Cause this could be huge.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.013
I got a million dog-bed ideas.

16:50.115 --> 16:52.716
I got a hot-dog bun,
I got a space capsule,

16:52.785 --> 16:54.051
I got an igloo.

16:54.119 --> 16:56.853
What about one shaped like a dog bone?

16:56.956 --> 16:57.921
You'll get there.

16:58.023 --> 16:59.189
(CHUCKLES)

17:02.161 --> 17:03.560
Hey, how's Lily doing?

17:03.629 --> 17:06.128
Well, I certainly didn't help.
I only made it worse.

17:06.198 --> 17:08.464
(GROANS) What am I gonna
do when our kids need me?

17:08.534 --> 17:09.833
You're overthinking it.

17:09.902 --> 17:11.969
The minute you see a sweet
little face that needs you,

17:12.037 --> 17:14.003
your instincts will kick in,
and you'll know what to do.

17:14.073 --> 17:15.839
- (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
- That's what everybody keeps saying,

17:15.941 --> 17:17.741
but what if it's not true?

17:19.612 --> 17:20.777
Hey, Mr. D.

17:20.878 --> 17:22.679
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

17:22.748 --> 17:24.714
I haven't slept for days,

17:24.817 --> 17:27.117
and I screwed up at work today.

17:27.185 --> 17:29.353
Oh, I'm sure it's not
as bad as you think.

17:29.421 --> 17:31.855
Well, the cameraman called it
"Disaster-piece Theatre,"

17:31.957 --> 17:33.523
and everybody was like,
"Good one, Craig."

17:33.592 --> 17:36.360
And you know what? It was.
It was a good one, Craig.

17:36.428 --> 17:37.861
Hey, it's okay.

17:37.930 --> 17:39.296
I had to rehire the crew

17:39.365 --> 17:41.131
to shoot the whole thing again tomorrow.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.199
I'm way over budget.

17:42.268 --> 17:43.500
I'm probably gonna lose the listing...

17:43.569 --> 17:44.735
Shh.

17:44.803 --> 17:46.303
You're just overtired.

17:46.372 --> 17:48.071
Why don't you close your eyes?

17:48.173 --> 17:49.906
Dylan, make some white noise.

17:50.009 --> 17:53.010
I am going to try something.

17:53.078 --> 17:54.311
Oh. That's nice.

17:54.413 --> 17:56.380
(DYLAN EXHALING SOFTLY)

18:01.820 --> 18:02.953
Honey.

18:03.055 --> 18:05.055
You're getting really good at this.

18:05.124 --> 18:06.423
You think so?

18:06.525 --> 18:08.091
I do.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.860
Thanks.

18:09.928 --> 18:12.362
All right. You just rest now.

18:12.464 --> 18:14.431
Everything's gonna be okay.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.034
Yeah. It is.

18:17.102 --> 18:19.569
(STRAINED) Can I stop now?
I'm gonna pass out.

18:21.006 --> 18:22.906
(EXHALING SOFTLY)

18:22.975 --> 18:25.309
We could just pick the lock
and get her out of there.

18:25.377 --> 18:27.144
And then what?
She doesn't want to talk to us.

18:27.212 --> 18:29.780
She never wants to talk to us.
That hasn't stopped us before.

18:29.882 --> 18:32.416
We're only letting it now
because we're uncomfortable, right?

18:32.484 --> 18:33.650
Obviously, you're right.

18:33.719 --> 18:36.787
Why else would I be
devouring Gloria's poultice?

18:36.855 --> 18:37.888
You know what?

18:37.990 --> 18:40.157
Come on. We're her dads.

18:40.259 --> 18:41.591
We'll figure something out.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.727
Hey, honey?

18:43.829 --> 18:44.795
Everyone's gone.

18:44.863 --> 18:46.463
And we're sorry we embarrassed you.

18:46.565 --> 18:49.399
We should've never included
all those people into...

18:49.501 --> 18:50.867
this situation.

18:50.936 --> 18:53.203
And just because we're
boys doesn't mean we...

18:53.272 --> 18:55.238
we can't talk you through your first...

18:55.307 --> 18:57.507
"sloughing off of your
endometrial tissue."

18:57.576 --> 18:59.776
Yeah, "which typically
lasts between two and...

18:59.878 --> 19:01.712
- seven days"?
- (WHISPERING) Seven?

19:01.780 --> 19:03.814
- Oh, my God.
- (WHISPERING) That's crazy.

19:03.882 --> 19:06.249
(NORMAL VOICE) Look, Lily,
your whole life, it's been...

19:06.318 --> 19:09.319
it's been the three of us
figuring out stuff together.

19:09.421 --> 19:12.022
(NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, don't you
remember in the... in the second grade,

19:12.124 --> 19:15.392
when you came home crying
because Julie Kwan made fun

19:15.461 --> 19:18.295
of your Ricky Martin
"She Bangs" lunch box?

19:18.397 --> 19:20.263
You didn't want to talk
about that, but then,

19:20.332 --> 19:23.233
when you finally did, you felt better.

19:23.335 --> 19:25.369
Yeah, you... you don't have
to figure this out alone.

19:25.437 --> 19:28.405
Yeah, we may not have gone
through the exact same thing,

19:28.507 --> 19:30.240
but, you know, in the seventh grade,

19:30.342 --> 19:32.042
our bodies started changing, too.

19:32.144 --> 19:33.276
Sixth for me.

19:33.379 --> 19:34.678
(SOFTLY) It's not a competition.

19:34.780 --> 19:37.080
(NORMAL VOICE) And those changes...

19:37.182 --> 19:38.348
they were confusing.

19:38.450 --> 19:41.084
Yeah, they were con...
confusing and scary

19:41.186 --> 19:43.453
and also, um...

19:43.555 --> 19:46.623
exciting because, um...

19:46.725 --> 19:48.959
you're growing up... Lily.

19:49.061 --> 19:50.360
And we're your parents, okay?

19:50.462 --> 19:51.528
We are gonna make mistakes,

19:51.630 --> 19:53.864
and we are not gonna
have all the answers,

19:53.966 --> 19:57.134
but when you do want to talk about it,

19:57.236 --> 19:59.236
we're... we're here for you.

19:59.338 --> 20:00.537
Yeah.

20:00.639 --> 20:01.972
We love you.

20:02.074 --> 20:03.540
(LOCK CLICKS)

20:10.089 --> 20:12.457
(WHISPERING) Uh-oh.
Here comes The Great Snoozedini.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.393
You see before you three ordinary cups.

20:15.495 --> 20:17.462
Cups you'd find in any kitchen.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.631
Nothing magical about them.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.933
Here, we have one new potato.

20:22.035 --> 20:25.235
Keep your eye on the
cup with the potato.

20:28.255 --> 20:30.431
Anybody here from out of town?

20:30.475 --> 20:32.651
I feel bad. Should we wake him up?

20:32.695 --> 20:34.784
Not until we find out
where the potato is.

20:34.827 --> 20:36.220
It's under that one, right?

20:36.263 --> 20:37.656
Is the potato here?

20:38.701 --> 20:40.833
Is the potato here?

20:41.791 --> 20:42.487
Ohh.

20:42.530 --> 20:44.663
This trick's a real...

20:44.707 --> 20:45.664
lemon.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.753
(LAUGHS)

20:47.797 --> 20:49.494
Good night, everyone.

20:49.537 --> 20:50.713
(GASPS)

20:51.757 --> 20:53.237
Amazing!

20:53.280 --> 20:55.892
(CHUCKLES)

20:55.935 --> 20:57.720
