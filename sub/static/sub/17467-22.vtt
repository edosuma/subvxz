10:17.486 --> 10:19.880
This is a gift
from God. Run!

10:23.797 --> 10:25.929
How on earth do you
go 20 years without

10:25.973 --> 10:27.496
paying your taxes?

10:27.539 --> 10:30.804
Like we say in the program,
one day at a time.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.068
So what happens now?

10:34.111 --> 10:36.331
Well, I got them
to give us another week.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.115
Which means you've got
a lot of work to do.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.074
No. I am not a lawyer.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.771
I am a junior at a college

10:41.815 --> 10:43.991
that's best known
for Web design.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.732
It's time to call Ray.

10:45.775 --> 10:46.863
Absolutely not.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.256
Oh, come on.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.302
I want to meet your big shot
half-black half-brother.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.826
Calm down, he's gay.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.742
You sure he's not half gay?

10:55.785 --> 10:58.135
He's half everything else.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.137
We're trying to keep
my mom out of jail.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.704
You can try and flip him later.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.098
I told you
I'm not calling him.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.448
Why are you blaming Ray for
all the crap your mother did?

11:06.491 --> 11:08.668
I have to blame someone.
Careful, you're on deck.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.106
Bonnie, you worked
so hard to let go

11:12.149 --> 11:13.716
of your resentment
towards your mother.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.762
Can't you do the same
for your brother?

11:15.805 --> 11:17.154
Well, that's a little hard,
Marjorie,

11:17.198 --> 11:19.896
since I have no idea
why I resent him.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.245
Well, you better figure it out,

11:21.289 --> 11:22.986
'cause we're meeting him
tomorrow at 2:00.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.901
You already called him?

11:24.945 --> 11:25.859
I sure did.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.730
Wow.

11:27.774 --> 11:31.386
I don't ask much of you,
only what I give in return--

11:31.429 --> 11:34.302
honesty, respect,
and most importantly, trust.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.132
[laughter]

11:38.175 --> 11:40.221
What?

11:40.264 --> 11:42.702
I do all those things!

11:42.745 --> 11:44.965
I just don't brag about it.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.575
[laughter continues]

11:46.618 --> 11:47.750
I'm humble.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.273
[laughter continues]

11:49.317 --> 11:51.232
All right, screw all of you!

11:55.976 --> 11:57.760
You believe this view?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.762
I get why rich people
look down on us.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.894
It's 'cause they really do.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.898
This is all pretentious crap.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.160
Oh, look,

12:06.203 --> 12:08.031
I can keep brandy
in a crystal decanter

12:08.075 --> 12:10.947
and drink moderately.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.036
[sighs]

12:13.080 --> 12:15.778
Someday I want to
sit in an office like this,

12:15.822 --> 12:18.346
wearing a Chanel suit
and a Prada bag,

12:18.389 --> 12:20.304
all the while helping the poor.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.871
If you plan on
helping the poor,

12:21.915 --> 12:23.525
that bag's gonna be
a knock-off.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.353
Hi, Ray.

12:25.396 --> 12:28.399
Christy, good to see you.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.487
Hi, Bonnie.

12:31.576 --> 12:34.231
So, little trouble
with the IRS, huh?

12:34.275 --> 12:35.798
Yes, I screwed up,

12:35.842 --> 12:38.018
but they didn't cover
tax law in the orphanage.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.020
You were never in an orphanage.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.805
It's poetic license.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.676
You know what,
maybe we should talk about

12:44.720 --> 12:46.069
the elephant in the room first.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.810
The elephant being
I was abandoned by our mother

12:47.854 --> 12:48.985
and you were kept?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.422
Bonnie, I get it.
You got a raw deal.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.468
But you do understand
I didn't know you existed

12:53.511 --> 12:54.512
until three months ago?

12:54.556 --> 12:56.688
I know that. It's just...

12:56.732 --> 12:59.082
I mean, look what you've done
with your life,

12:59.126 --> 13:00.736
and look at mine.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.130
I mean, who is this,
your boyfriend?

13:03.173 --> 13:04.696
What is he, a model?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.786
He's my husband. And yes.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.006
Oh, come on.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.009
Look, I'm sorry this has
been so painful for you.

13:13.053 --> 13:16.273
But maybe there's a silver
lining in your tax problems.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.623
We can use this
to get to know each other,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.234
be brother and sister.

13:20.277 --> 13:23.019
How can you not
like this guy?

13:23.063 --> 13:26.327
I find ways not to like you,
and you're adorable.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.941
Bonnie, let me help you.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.988
No strings attached.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.035
All right, but you owe me one.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.689
Wait, why would I...

13:40.732 --> 13:41.951
Never mind.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.999
So clear this up for me.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.697
What kind of a person doesn't
pay taxes for 20 years?

13:48.740 --> 13:51.265
Well, I like to think of myself
as a folk hero.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.835
So the money you didn't
pay the government

13:55.878 --> 13:57.401
you gave to the poor?

13:57.445 --> 14:00.752
Well, speaking as
a poor person, yes.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.495
All right, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

14:04.539 --> 14:05.975
We'll go to the IRS next week

14:06.019 --> 14:07.890
and try to cut
some kind of a deal.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.066
See what happens when
you have a real lawyer?

14:10.110 --> 14:11.938
Oh, don't be so humble.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.678
I'm gonna be using your notes.

14:13.722 --> 14:14.636
Really?

14:14.679 --> 14:16.290
You did some nice work in here.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.813
In fact,

14:17.857 --> 14:20.120
when I go back to the IRS,
why don't you come with me?

14:20.163 --> 14:22.035
You don't have to do that.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.515
I'm not doing you a favor.
You'd be a big help.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.518
That's great.
I'd love to join you guys.

14:27.562 --> 14:28.998
Oh, she's not going.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.089
I'm not?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.961
Oh, God, no.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.354
That's really
the only mistake you made.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.925
[sportscast playing over TV]

14:42.969 --> 14:44.709
Seriously? You're just
gonna watch hockey

14:44.753 --> 14:46.363
while my life
hangs in the balance?

14:46.407 --> 14:48.931
Kind of hard for me
to pace, Bon.

14:48.975 --> 14:52.935
I just want you to know
if I go to jail,

14:52.979 --> 14:54.110
you need to find someone else.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.764
I don't want you to wait for me.

14:55.807 --> 14:56.547
Okay.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.334
Come on. You're not even
gonna lie to me?

15:00.377 --> 15:02.771
It's a playoff game, Bon.
I'm not really listening.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.515
[phone chimes]Ooh, this could be Christy.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.386
[sighs] Damn it, Jill.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.563
No, I am not introducing you
to my half-gay brother.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.133
I can't believe we won!

15:17.177 --> 15:18.656
Well, technically,
we didn't win.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.267
We settled.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.052
In my family,
settling is winning.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.880
I'm gonna call my mom
and let her know.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.099
Whoa, hold on.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.883
Lesson number one:
never tell the client

15:27.927 --> 15:30.146
it took 15 minutes
to do a day's work.

15:30.190 --> 15:33.062
They're called "billable
hours" for a reason.

15:33.106 --> 15:36.065
So we're just supposed to
let her sit at home and sweat?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.980
Think about it.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.942
Oh, man, I can't wait
to be a lawyer.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.291
And you're gonna be a good one.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.988
As a matter of fact,

15:46.032 --> 15:48.208
if you don't get snatched
up by a better firm,

15:48.251 --> 15:49.992
maybe you could
come intern for me.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.342
I would love that.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.344
Consider it done.

15:54.388 --> 15:57.826
Don't most firms have
a policy about nepotism?

15:57.869 --> 16:00.960
Christy...

16:01.003 --> 16:03.136
look at us.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.095
You're right, I think we're
gonna get away with it. [laughs]

16:08.750 --> 16:13.059
And to all of you,
for never giving up on me,

16:13.102 --> 16:15.800
from the bottom of my heart,
thank you.

16:15.844 --> 16:16.845
Adam,

16:16.888 --> 16:17.889
my love.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.108
My daughter, Christy.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.024
My dear friends.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.766
I couldn't have done it
without your support.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.290
Does she think she won an award?

16:29.031 --> 16:31.468
And thanks to
my long-lost brother Ray,

16:31.512 --> 16:34.123
the IRS is giving me ten years
to pay off my debt.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.213
What a bunch of suckers.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.001
Anyway, I'm glad
we're finally getting a chance

16:42.044 --> 16:43.306
to know each other.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.178
Yes, we are.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.226
Uh...

16:50.270 --> 16:51.749
Thank you, Bonnie.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.058
I can't help thinking
that you and Christy

16:56.102 --> 16:58.234
coming into my life...

16:58.278 --> 16:59.888
maybe it wasn't a coincidence.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.761
Maybe there's a reason for it.

17:05.023 --> 17:09.202
Boy, this is hard to say,

17:09.244 --> 17:12.161
but I guess you're probably
the best people to say it to.

17:14.032 --> 17:17.949
I've gotten to a point where...

17:17.992 --> 17:20.082
I'm snorting coke every day.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.175
Welcome to the family!
We're here!Come here, little brother.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.309
Yay![excited chatter continues]

17:37.882 --> 17:39.667
What are you
still doing up?

17:39.710 --> 17:42.931
Believe it or not,
reading more about tax law.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.934
Why? I got away with it.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.892
Well, I'm still interested.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.720
Did you know the French
put a tax on salt,

17:49.764 --> 17:51.157
and that's what led
to the French Revolution?

17:51.200 --> 17:55.074
Wow, you really have given
up on men, haven't you?

17:57.902 --> 17:59.208
Can I tell you something?

17:59.252 --> 18:00.818
Sure.

18:00.862 --> 18:04.605
I am so impressed
with what you did.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.433
Ray did most of it.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.825
That's not true.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.001
And that's not
what I'm talking about.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.829
You've been sober
for four years now,

18:11.873 --> 18:13.266
you're almost done with college,

18:13.309 --> 18:15.398
on your way
to becoming a lawyer.

18:15.442 --> 18:18.053
I am so proud of you.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.752
Wow, Mom, that means a lot.

18:21.796 --> 18:26.105
Hey, I probably don't
say this enough,

18:26.148 --> 18:29.195
but you are an amazing person,
and I love you.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.809
You have another
legal problem, don't you?

18:34.852 --> 18:36.854
I might have slapped
a meter maid,

18:36.898 --> 18:40.336
but that doesn't take away
from anything I said.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.295
It does a little, but thanks.
