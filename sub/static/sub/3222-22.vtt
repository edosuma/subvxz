WEBVTT

00:03.963 --> 00:05.658
We think it may have been an Alpha.

00:05.832 --> 00:07.800
- An Alpha? Like...
- Like all monsters come from somewhere.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.366
Bag me a live Alpha.

00:09.535 --> 00:11.662
- The first of your species.
- The very first.

00:12.004 --> 00:14.131
Prison full of monsters.
Can't leave them.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.104
- Can't let them go.
- I understand.

00:16.274 --> 00:18.937
GeoThrive is part of Roman, Inc?
Dick's funding an archeological dig.

00:19.111 --> 00:21.204
Factory in Saudi Arabia.
Fishery in Jakarta.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.280
A research center. It's everywhere.

00:23.449 --> 00:25.041
It's all tied together, Dean.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.044
He's not in control.

00:28.254 --> 00:30.814
- That was vengeful spirit crap.
- But it's still Bobby.

00:33.759 --> 00:35.522
- What the hell are you?
- I'm, uh...

00:35.695 --> 00:37.162
...Kevin Tran.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.992
- I'm in advanced placement.
- He's a prophet of the Lord.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.464
- And that's the word of God?
- One of them, yes.

00:42.635 --> 00:44.466
- What's it say?
- It's about Leviathan.

00:44.637 --> 00:46.502
Does it say how to kill them?

00:46.672 --> 00:50.699
"Leviathan cannot be slain but by
a bone of a righteous mortal washed...

00:50.877 --> 00:52.469
...in the three bloods of the fallen."

00:52.645 --> 00:54.875
We need to start
with the blood of a fallen angel.

00:55.047 --> 00:58.847
I'm always happy to bleed
for the Winchesters.

01:01.053 --> 01:02.111
Hello, Kevin.

01:05.591 --> 01:08.719
<i>Business Watch with our own Gloria Jane.</i>

01:08.895 --> 01:11.830
Thanks, Phil. And now
we turn our attention to agriculture...

01:11.998 --> 01:15.661
...where an unlikely personality has now
come onto the scene in a major way.

01:16.168 --> 01:17.260
Richard Roman...

01:17.436 --> 01:20.837
...a CEO whose company dominates
the defense and aviation sectors...

01:21.007 --> 01:24.238
...not to mention being a giant
in the motivational speaking world.

01:24.410 --> 01:26.776
What can I say, Gloria, I'm a multitasker.

01:26.946 --> 01:31.076
Clearly, and now you've recently purchased
controlling stock in SucroCorp...

01:31.250 --> 01:34.686
...among the world's leading manufacturers
in high-fructose corn syrup.

01:34.854 --> 01:37.550
- It's a pleasure to have you, Richard.
- Please...

01:37.723 --> 01:39.384
...Dick.
So tell us, Dick...

01:39.559 --> 01:41.550
...why the recent fascination
with big foods?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.252
Well, it's no secret we all love to eat...

01:44.897 --> 01:47.593
...but now SucroCorp will focus
on eating well.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.132
Help me connect the dots.

01:49.335 --> 01:52.395
How will pumping sweeteners into our
system make us healthier?

01:52.572 --> 01:54.403
One word: Purity.

01:55.041 --> 01:57.601
<i>We're dialing back the additives
to deliver the highest-quality...</i>

01:57.777 --> 01:59.870
<i>...all-American products
you people deserve.</i>

02:00.046 --> 02:02.105
<i>America is for go-getters...</i>

02:02.415 --> 02:04.906
<i>...folks who get off their butts
and make it happen.</i>

02:05.084 --> 02:07.450
<i>And we need you just as healthy
as you can be.</i>

02:07.620 --> 02:11.420
<i>Which is why we're diving whole hog into
what keeps Americans living longer...</i>

02:11.591 --> 02:12.922
...and tasting better.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.754
You do of course mean to say
the food will be tasting better.

02:17.597 --> 02:19.792
That's exactly what I mean.

02:29.308 --> 02:30.775
Yeah, I like that.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.642
Your 11 a.m. Is in the conference room.

02:39.819 --> 02:41.946
Thank you, Susan.

02:49.528 --> 02:53.487
Susan, aren't we still looking for a rep
in mainstream media?

02:53.766 --> 02:54.926
Yes, we are.

02:55.101 --> 02:57.331
<i>Wunderbar.
Put a replace order on Gloria there.</i>

03:02.608 --> 03:05.441
- And with the corpse?
- Call Chef Fieri.

03:05.711 --> 03:08.111
I feel like barbecue.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.984
Kevin.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.713
Dick.

03:18.624 --> 03:20.990
I'm very excited to meet you.

03:23.229 --> 03:24.719
You nervous?

03:25.064 --> 03:26.224
Don't be.

03:26.532 --> 03:28.625
I'm your biggest fan.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.660
I brought you a present.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.005
What's that say, Kev?

03:44.250 --> 03:47.048
- I don't know.
- Cute.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.177
Edgar?

03:55.394 --> 03:57.862
Easy, Edgar. Don't scare the boy.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.401
You know, I've checked, Kevin.

04:06.572 --> 04:10.030
Number one in your class, winner of the
Chad Kennedy Top Young Scientist Prize.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.336
All that on top of being
Keeper of the Word.

04:12.545 --> 04:15.173
You're a clever young man.

04:15.381 --> 04:19.180
I'm confident you'll make
the right choice here.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.584
But I see this is a negotiation.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.924
Well, I will sweeten the pot.

04:30.429 --> 04:32.192
What is it?

04:32.364 --> 04:34.889
My sources tell me
you're applying to Princeton.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.798
Letter of recommendation like that
from a man like me?

04:39.004 --> 04:40.266
Done.

04:48.948 --> 04:52.042
- I can't do it.
- I admire your gumption, kid.

04:52.218 --> 04:54.948
But I still think
there's some wiggle room here.

04:55.287 --> 04:56.413
I tell you what.

04:56.589 --> 05:00.616
Let's kick it up a notch,
see if I can't change your mind.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.657
Edgar, that live feed up yet?

05:04.430 --> 05:06.227
Course.

05:11.237 --> 05:12.295
Mom.

05:12.905 --> 05:16.841
- Mom!
- Well, I think this negotiation is completed.

05:19.044 --> 05:21.239
You drive a hard bargain, kid.

05:30.790 --> 05:35.090
<i>Okay, man, I have read this more times
than the Playboy I found in Dad's duffel.</i>

05:36.295 --> 05:38.195
Anna Nicole?

05:38.764 --> 05:40.595
Anna Nicole.

05:40.766 --> 05:42.563
Oh, the good, they die young, huh?

05:45.137 --> 05:48.368
Look, we could read this till our eyes
bleed. It ain't getting any clearer.

05:48.574 --> 05:50.439
Okay, then, what does it mean?

05:51.911 --> 05:53.071
Uh...

05:53.779 --> 05:55.804
"Cut off the head
and the body will flounder."

05:55.981 --> 05:58.779
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, I think we both agree that, uh...

05:58.951 --> 06:00.316
...the head is Dick, right?

06:00.820 --> 06:03.288
- Right.
- So bottom line is we go grab the stuff...

06:03.455 --> 06:05.719
...and we mix ourselves a weapon,
end of story.

06:05.891 --> 06:08.826
Look, I'm all for killing Dick,
I'm just saying, what then?

06:08.994 --> 06:12.191
What about the rest of the Leviathan?
What, are they gonnajust...

06:12.364 --> 06:14.491
...drop dead?
I don't know, maybe.

06:14.667 --> 06:15.691
Maybe?

06:15.868 --> 06:17.733
Maybe is good enough for you right now?

06:17.903 --> 06:20.838
- One problem at a time, all right?
- Okay, but it's not a crazy idea...

06:21.006 --> 06:23.566
...to figure out what the catch is
before we go crashing the gate.

06:23.742 --> 06:25.004
Maybe this is the catch.

06:25.244 --> 06:28.236
God's not telling us every detail,
you know?

06:28.414 --> 06:30.177
The word is from God.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.647
I don't know how much better
it's gonna get.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.198
Hey, Bobby.

06:57.443 --> 06:59.638
- How you feeling?
- Stronger than ever.

06:59.912 --> 07:03.905
Now, while you two have been chasing your
tails, I've been thinking on that weapon.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.449
- Shouldn't you be saving your strength?
- For what?

07:06.652 --> 07:08.620
You might wanna slow down.
You don't look so hot.

07:08.787 --> 07:11.278
I'm in the veil. My Brad
Pitt days are over.

07:11.924 --> 07:14.791
Now, the kid says
that the only way to kill Leviathan...

07:14.960 --> 07:18.191
...is with a bone washed in the
three bloods of the fallen.

07:18.364 --> 07:20.958
It's gotta be from a human
as light and good...

07:21.166 --> 07:23.600
...as the Leviathan are hungry and dark.

07:23.769 --> 07:26.294
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- The rest is doable...

07:26.472 --> 07:29.703
...and doable now.
You've already got the fallen angel blood.

07:29.875 --> 07:33.367
Next up is blood
from the Ruler of Fallen Humanity.

07:33.712 --> 07:35.873
Best I can tell, that's Crowley.

07:36.048 --> 07:38.778
<i>Numero tres
is the Father of Fallen Beasts.</i>

07:39.051 --> 07:40.985
- Which means?
- You gotta bleed an Alpha.

07:41.186 --> 07:42.881
But they're all dead.

07:43.055 --> 07:46.047
We rounded them up for Crowley,
and then Cass whammied them all.

07:46.225 --> 07:47.886
Well, make this Cass' problem too.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.391
Cass ain't exactly in the problem-solving
mode, Bobby.

07:50.562 --> 07:51.620
Then Crowley.

07:52.398 --> 07:53.797
- All right, I get it.
- Do you?

08:01.907 --> 08:03.602
Just saying.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.642
I have faith that you boys
will figure it out.

08:09.949 --> 08:12.076
Relax, I'm fine.

08:13.852 --> 08:16.343
Just got a little carried away.

08:19.725 --> 08:25.425
<i>Here at SucroCorp,
your well-being is our number one priority.</i>

08:25.597 --> 08:30.660
<i>SucroCorp. Eat well. Live well.</i>

08:31.337 --> 08:35.671
Little FYI: Bobby's officing
out of the john these days.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.933
- Uh, awkward.
- You're telling me.

08:40.111 --> 08:42.672
He does have some ideas
about the weapon, though.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.145
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.513
Well, uh, he may be just in time.

08:50.022 --> 08:51.990
Roman acquires... What's SucroCorp?

08:52.157 --> 08:55.752
They make food additives, namely,
high-fructose corn syrup.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.888
That crap is in just about everything.

08:59.064 --> 09:01.532
Uh, soda, sauces, bread.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.861
- Don't say pie.
- Definitely pie.

09:04.036 --> 09:05.503
- Bastards.
- Heh.

09:05.771 --> 09:07.966
So now what? Roman's moved
past restaurants?

09:08.140 --> 09:11.906
And into grocery stores, Gas N' Sips,
vending machines...

09:12.077 --> 09:13.237
What can we do about it?

09:13.412 --> 09:17.872
Short of going al Qaeda on their trucks and
plants, there's nothing we can do about it.

09:21.286 --> 09:22.810
Like I said, uh...

09:22.988 --> 09:24.580
...Bobby's got some ideas.

09:31.063 --> 09:32.291
Hello, boys.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.437
That's some bracing prose
you're putting down there, Kevin.

09:48.313 --> 09:49.746
You all done?

09:51.083 --> 09:52.573
Mm-hm.

09:52.751 --> 09:55.618
You've done well.
Princeton will be lucky to have you.

09:56.889 --> 09:57.947
What about my mom?

09:58.724 --> 10:00.555
Make the call.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.192
Release her...

10:06.365 --> 10:08.595
...but stress the consequences of talking.

10:08.767 --> 10:12.203
Kevin, I'm gonna request
the pleasure of your company a tad longer.

10:12.371 --> 10:15.135
You, on the other hand,
I need to drop in on an old friend.

10:17.476 --> 10:21.037
So that's what all the rumble-rumble
was about.

10:21.213 --> 10:22.441
Who translated it for you?

10:22.614 --> 10:24.980
Never mind. You gonna
give us the blood or not?

10:25.484 --> 10:26.576
Happily.

10:27.886 --> 10:29.717
But not quite yet.

10:30.155 --> 10:34.649
I'm all for chopping Dick, but I can't have
you running around with a vial of my blood.

10:35.994 --> 10:39.794
You know the sheer number of nefarious
spells my enemies could use it for?

10:40.899 --> 10:42.423
- Well, then when?
- Last.

10:42.901 --> 10:46.098
After you've got
all the other components.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.465
Most difficult...

10:47.639 --> 10:50.130
...the angel part, I'm assuming.

10:54.279 --> 10:58.443
Given your role in their little apocalypse,
I can't imagine the choir boys upstairs...

10:58.617 --> 11:01.916
...are wetting their vestments to do you...
What's the word? A solid.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.252
Unless, of course,
you have an angel up your sleeve.

11:05.824 --> 11:08.156
Well, that'd be convenient, but, uh, no.

11:10.028 --> 11:12.189
Don't worry, we'll get the angel blood.

11:12.397 --> 11:15.332
- We just need you to be ready next time.
- Fine.

11:15.501 --> 11:17.492
Oh, here's a tip.

11:17.936 --> 11:22.669
I have it on good authority
there's one Alpha still among us.

11:22.841 --> 11:24.502
Whose authority?

11:25.611 --> 11:26.839
Mine.

11:27.012 --> 11:28.707
Wily character, that Alpha vampire.

11:28.914 --> 11:32.372
Somehow made good his prison break
before Cass went nuclear on the place.

11:32.551 --> 11:35.019
- And you know this how?
- Keep your friends close...

11:35.187 --> 11:38.714
...your enemies, blah, blah.
Needless to say, I keep tabs.

11:39.691 --> 11:41.989
He moves around quite a bit...

11:42.528 --> 11:46.624
...but I have an inkling I know
where to start the Easter egg hunt.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.292
Happy trails.

11:50.702 --> 11:53.034
Okay, where, jackass?

12:00.312 --> 12:02.940
Hoople, North Dakota.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.976
Piece of paper would have worked.

12:17.996 --> 12:19.361
Hey.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.671
He seem angry?

12:34.846 --> 12:37.508
Course he's angry. If you were
Bobby, wouldn't you be?

12:37.683 --> 12:40.618
But was he showing signs of fatigue,
like fritzing?

12:40.786 --> 12:44.381
No, actually. Just the opposite.
He said he never felt stronger.

12:45.023 --> 12:46.183
That's what I was afraid of.

12:47.926 --> 12:51.521
The stronger he gets, the closer he comes
to going full vengeful spirit.

12:51.697 --> 12:55.133
That's reality. And we need to talk about
what we're gonna do with him.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.528
- Do with him?
- Yeah.

12:56.702 --> 12:58.795
Three weeks ago, you were talking
how this could work.

12:58.971 --> 13:00.529
Now you wanna go Kevorkian
on his ass?

13:00.706 --> 13:05.234
I'm just saying that the lore doesn't have a
single real life Casper the Friendly Ghost.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.243
<i>It's all basically Poltergeist
until a hunter comes along...</i>

13:08.413 --> 13:10.506
Yeah, well, the lore sucks.

13:10.782 --> 13:12.374
I'm talking pure hatred, Dean.

13:12.951 --> 13:14.043
No humanity.

13:14.219 --> 13:17.655
I mean, he could kill, possess people.

13:17.889 --> 13:20.119
Bobby could burn this freaking
building down.

13:20.292 --> 13:21.919
- If he goes off the rails...
- Hey.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.425
- What?
- Check out that guy over there.

13:25.664 --> 13:27.825
He seem a little out of it to you?

13:29.901 --> 13:31.061
I don't know. Maybe.

13:36.742 --> 13:38.300
What about Paula Deen over here?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.675
Yeah, they look like, uh...

13:50.155 --> 13:52.089
...like those turducken people.

13:53.592 --> 13:55.423
It's starting.

13:58.864 --> 14:00.422
It's the corn syrup.

14:00.599 --> 14:02.931
Everything in the store is laced with it.

14:03.101 --> 14:04.466
Everything?

14:10.609 --> 14:14.841
Hey, man, I'm gonna go into toxic shock,
okay? I need my road food.

14:15.013 --> 14:16.640
That's what Roman is banking on.

14:17.949 --> 14:20.213
Hey, hey...

14:20.385 --> 14:23.320
...this one says natural.
That means it's safe, right?

14:24.723 --> 14:28.284
I hate to break it to you,
but corn syrup is natural, technically.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.894
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to eat?

14:41.306 --> 14:43.137
It's totally dark. I can't see inside.

14:44.609 --> 14:46.008
Should we wait for daylight?

14:46.178 --> 14:47.668
Hell, no, we're not waiting.

14:48.113 --> 14:50.741
I'll scout it, see if we need to
bring in the big guns.

14:50.916 --> 14:53.510
I don't know, Bobby...

15:08.200 --> 15:10.259
Okay, place is clear.

15:10.435 --> 15:12.665
But there's something
you're gonna wanna see.

15:25.283 --> 15:26.716
Careful.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.968
You know a way to kill vamps
with battery acid?

15:51.910 --> 15:53.707
Only way I know is beheading.

15:54.446 --> 15:56.437
Well, something didn't agree with them.

15:59.351 --> 16:00.716
Hey.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.812
Check out that wall.

16:03.155 --> 16:04.782
Something seem weird to you?

16:10.162 --> 16:12.687
See if you can find a switch
or lever or something.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.167
Don't need one.

16:29.314 --> 16:30.372
Hey.

16:45.063 --> 16:47.156
Dean, machete.

16:47.332 --> 16:49.061
Hi. Look...

16:49.234 --> 16:52.032
...we're not gonna hurt you, okay?
No fangs.

16:52.204 --> 16:53.330
See?

16:53.505 --> 16:54.665
We just wanna talk.

16:56.274 --> 16:57.866
I was 8.

16:58.043 --> 17:02.537
My mom left me at the playground
while she ran to the store.

17:03.482 --> 17:07.781
A man approached me
and said I was the prettiest girl there.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.682
And I've been living with these...

17:11.690 --> 17:13.123
...things...

17:13.290 --> 17:14.848
...ever since.

17:15.126 --> 17:17.185
At least until now.

17:18.597 --> 17:19.928
Do you have any idea why?

17:21.566 --> 17:23.261
I'm one of his special girls.

17:24.569 --> 17:27.094
All the others,
it was their job to make sure...

17:27.271 --> 17:29.797
...I was ready for the Alpha
whenever he came.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.136
Wash me, give me my IV bags every day.

17:35.914 --> 17:38.041
It's my only food.

17:38.216 --> 17:39.513
So my blood's pure.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.145
And they've been doing this
for 12 years?

17:44.055 --> 17:45.386
Virgins are a delicacy.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.759
He always has at least one of us on hand.

17:48.927 --> 17:52.294
Well, don't worry, okay? We're gonna
get you back to your mother.

17:52.731 --> 17:55.097
- Think she remembers me?
- Of course she does.

17:55.267 --> 17:57.599
I mean, don't you remember her?

18:02.274 --> 18:04.003
Hey, these, uh...

18:04.175 --> 18:06.143
...these guys.
They, uh, friends of yours?

18:06.311 --> 18:09.144
They take care of the Alpha when he's here.
Or did.

18:09.314 --> 18:12.613
- What happened to them?
- A week ago they came back from...

18:12.784 --> 18:14.445
...what they said was an easy hunt.

18:15.086 --> 18:16.815
Three humans just came...

18:16.988 --> 18:18.421
...didn't put up any fight.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.857
But when they started on them,
the vampires screamed in pain.

18:24.362 --> 18:27.695
- The ones who ate died immediately.
- And the ones who didn't?

18:27.866 --> 18:28.958
There was only one.

18:29.134 --> 18:31.364
When he saw what happened,
he moved to animals.

18:31.570 --> 18:34.004
He's out hunting as we speak.

18:34.973 --> 18:37.168
Never heard of vamps
being allergic to humans.

18:37.342 --> 18:39.105
You think maybe it's the corn syrup?

18:39.277 --> 18:41.507
I mean, think about it,
that Gas N' Sip was...

18:41.680 --> 18:45.673
...lousy with stoners, ripe for the picking.
- She did say it was an easy hunt.

18:46.518 --> 18:49.043
- Do you know where the Alpha is now?
- I don't know...

18:49.220 --> 18:50.346
...maybe.

18:50.522 --> 18:52.683
He has a place he goes
when something's wrong.

18:52.857 --> 18:54.017
He calls it his retreat.

18:59.664 --> 19:01.131
What is that?

19:02.334 --> 19:03.562
That's, uh...

19:03.735 --> 19:05.327
That's Sam's douche tracker.

19:07.639 --> 19:10.164
Helps us find the Alpha.
All we need's an address.

19:11.409 --> 19:13.001
I don't know.

19:13.178 --> 19:15.043
But I remember things that could help.

19:17.682 --> 19:19.616
It's okay, just do the best you can.

19:42.841 --> 19:43.865
Finally.

19:45.243 --> 19:47.404
I'd run out of magazines.

19:47.879 --> 19:50.177
Quick question: Where's your boss?

19:54.185 --> 19:55.880
Let's try that again.

19:56.054 --> 19:57.715
- Where is he?
- Go to hell.

19:57.889 --> 20:00.881
No...
My neighborhood is worse than that.

20:07.198 --> 20:08.859
Missoula, Montana.

20:09.034 --> 20:10.797
Was that so hard?

20:15.674 --> 20:16.732
I can't do this.

20:16.941 --> 20:20.377
Man, I can't live on rabbit food.
I'm... I'm a warrior.

20:20.578 --> 20:21.670
Dean, you'll be fine.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.473
- You don't know that.
- Heh.

20:23.815 --> 20:25.282
So, what's next on the list?

20:25.450 --> 20:27.350
Well, if we're bum-rushing the Alpha...

20:27.519 --> 20:31.580
...then we're gonna need dead man's blood,
which means a morgue, or...

20:31.823 --> 20:32.949
Or what?

20:38.229 --> 20:42.029
Or forget the morgue,
we are swimming in vamp poison.

20:44.335 --> 20:45.529
Excuse me, sir.

20:45.770 --> 20:49.638
Hi, we, uh...
We're with the, uh, Red Cross.

20:49.841 --> 20:54.369
See, we have an emergency shortage
and we're gonna need you to...

20:56.715 --> 20:59.343
You're not getting a word I'm saying,
are you?

21:00.418 --> 21:01.885
Hey.

21:02.153 --> 21:05.782
- Hold out your arm, we need your blood.
- Dude.

21:07.992 --> 21:09.755
All right, Sam.

21:09.994 --> 21:11.825
- Tap the keg.
- Here?

21:11.996 --> 21:14.089
Sam, look around.
It's freaking Woodstock.

21:14.265 --> 21:16.130
Everybody's hopped up
on the brown acid.

21:16.301 --> 21:19.168
We don't need the song and dance.
Give him a little prick.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.575
Ow.

21:35.453 --> 21:37.819
That hurts.

21:39.324 --> 21:44.125
- This is for Hurricane Katrina, you said?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

21:46.331 --> 21:47.696
So look, uh...

21:48.767 --> 21:50.826
...when we get there...
Yeah?

21:56.608 --> 21:58.667
Bobby's gonna have to hang back.

21:58.977 --> 22:01.036
- Do you disagree?
- He ain't gonna like it.

22:01.212 --> 22:02.679
He helped us in getting Emily.

22:02.847 --> 22:04.974
I'm Team Bobby too.
But there's a reason...

22:05.150 --> 22:08.278
...we left him in the car with Emily.
The more action he sees...

22:08.453 --> 22:11.684
...the more chance he gets to spin out.
All right, fine.

22:12.056 --> 22:15.890
So we keep him off the front lines,
and he can just...

22:16.060 --> 22:19.621
...you know, keep calm and carry on, right?
And if he can't?

22:25.036 --> 22:28.096
<i>Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?</i>

22:38.650 --> 22:42.381
When they hauled you off to vamp camp,
do you remember how long the drive was?

22:42.554 --> 22:46.012
We left at night, got in before dawn.

22:46.191 --> 22:50.423
- So six, seven hours?
- I think so. Yes.

22:50.595 --> 22:53.894
- You remember any highways?
- No. We only took back roads.

22:54.065 --> 22:56.693
Okay. So figure they averaged
45 miles per...

22:56.868 --> 22:59.735
- Couldn't have been more than 300 miles.
- Right.

22:59.904 --> 23:01.667
What direction were you going?

23:01.873 --> 23:05.741
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Em, you're doing great.

23:06.277 --> 23:09.678
Um, is there anything else you remember?

23:09.914 --> 23:11.211
Bells.

23:11.382 --> 23:16.217
- As we pulled up, I heard these loud bells.
- It was still dark out...?

23:16.387 --> 23:18.719
- You thinking church?
- No, it's too early.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.791
Could've been a monastery.
Monks get up at 4 a.m. To pray.

23:21.960 --> 23:22.984
Ugh.

23:23.161 --> 23:26.255
Can't get laid, can't sleep in.
What a freaking tragedy.

23:27.632 --> 23:31.261
Okay, so Alpha's camping
next to a monk-y house.

23:34.072 --> 23:36.063
How many we got in range?

23:36.507 --> 23:39.203
Looks like one, just outside, uh...

23:50.388 --> 23:52.754
This is where he took me.

23:53.591 --> 23:55.388
Are you sure?

23:58.229 --> 23:59.423
What now?

23:59.597 --> 24:03.761
We get you someplace safe,
circle back, and Ginsu these leeches.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.167
<i>The house she wanted, but couldn't get it.</i>

24:08.339 --> 24:11.069
<i>Yes, the famous Fleur-de-Lys Mansion...</i>

24:11.242 --> 24:14.370
<i>...a $125 billion estate right down
the street from Katie's place...</i>

24:14.545 --> 24:16.513
Ah, all right. Here we go.

24:16.681 --> 24:18.979
Ten cc's of Vamptonite.

24:19.684 --> 24:20.844
It's a thing.

24:21.052 --> 24:23.418
What's a Kardashian?

24:24.289 --> 24:28.089
Oh, that's, uh, just another bloodsucker.

24:30.128 --> 24:33.359
No, it... It's a joke.

24:34.499 --> 24:39.163
Here. If we're not back by dawn,
call this number. Jody Mills.

24:39.337 --> 24:42.636
She's a friend.
She'll take care of you.

24:44.142 --> 24:46.872
- Use this phone.
- You gotta hang here...

24:47.345 --> 24:51.179
- ...for your own good, capiche?
- Sam, thank you.

24:51.382 --> 24:52.974
You bet.

25:04.028 --> 25:05.723
It was the wind, heh.

25:08.499 --> 25:11.332
Chill out, Bobby. We'll be back soon.

25:21.045 --> 25:23.741
- He didn't take that well.
- How'd you think he was gonna take it?

25:23.915 --> 25:26.179
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

25:52.944 --> 25:54.639
Hi, Daddy.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.512
Why, you little schemer.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.310
No, I'm close by.

26:00.518 --> 26:03.385
<i>- Sending you a present.
- And that's Dick Roman.</i>

26:03.588 --> 26:07.046
<i>Yesterday, I introduced you to
this rising star in American business.</i>

26:07.225 --> 26:09.352
<i>In this hour, we'll go behind the scenes...</i>

26:09.527 --> 26:12.394
<i>...and answer the question
everyone's been asking:</i>

26:12.597 --> 26:14.531
<i>What makes Dick so hard to beat?</i>

26:15.633 --> 26:18.295
You son of a bitch.

26:19.804 --> 26:22.364
Oh, this time of day,
most of them will be catching Z's.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.303
They won't know what hit them.

26:26.611 --> 26:28.476
Hey, you with me?

26:29.347 --> 26:30.837
Yeah.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.240
But?

26:35.820 --> 26:39.483
You sure you wanna charge in there,
machetes blazing? Last time, it took...

26:39.657 --> 26:43.252
...a dozen hunters to take down the Alpha.
Most of them didn't make it out.

26:43.428 --> 26:45.862
Yeah, well, you got a better idea?

26:51.903 --> 26:54.565
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

27:07.018 --> 27:08.417
Dean.

27:14.459 --> 27:16.427
Maybe we're too late.

27:16.594 --> 27:17.652
Whoa!

27:17.829 --> 27:19.228
Sam!

27:20.665 --> 27:24.726
<i>You know, where I'm from, you have to
bite and claw your way to the top.</i>

27:24.936 --> 27:27.905
<i>Once you get there, trust me,
the view is incredible.</i>

27:31.109 --> 27:34.044
Okay. Dean's birthday.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.311
Sam's birthday.

27:39.417 --> 27:41.612
<i>I'm making some very big moves...</i>

27:43.588 --> 27:45.613
Damn it!

27:52.463 --> 27:54.556
- Son of a bitch.
- Everything okay in there?

27:54.732 --> 27:56.723
My birthday.

27:56.934 --> 27:58.799
Hello?

28:04.275 --> 28:06.106
- I need your help.
- Get away from me.

28:06.811 --> 28:09.780
- Listen, I need out of here.
- Please.

28:20.358 --> 28:22.349
Just need you a little while.

28:36.674 --> 28:39.234
Just until I get the bastard.

28:51.189 --> 28:53.623
The Winchesters.

28:54.392 --> 28:55.984
I'm intrigued.

28:59.497 --> 29:02.261
- Emily?
- Hi, Sam.

29:04.335 --> 29:08.635
Wow, for a girl raised in a basement,
you're a hell of an actress.

29:08.839 --> 29:11.103
- You were gonna hurt my daddy.
- Mm.

29:11.275 --> 29:14.642
Wow, you get a trophy
in Stockholm syndrome.

29:15.479 --> 29:18.346
And sorry to burst your bubble,
but, uh, we weren't.

29:18.516 --> 29:20.814
Sam here had a better idea.

29:21.018 --> 29:23.043
We're here to talk. That's it.

29:26.357 --> 29:32.193
Now that my guys have taken your blades,
and your syringes of tainted blood...

29:32.363 --> 29:33.990
...is that what you mean?

29:34.732 --> 29:38.725
Well, we, uh, figured
you might hold a grudge.

29:39.437 --> 29:40.904
And why would I?

29:41.305 --> 29:46.072
Because you captured me?
Tortured me? Sold me to the king of hell?

29:47.245 --> 29:49.236
That was more our grandpa.

29:59.457 --> 30:02.153
Thank you. That was awesome.

30:02.326 --> 30:06.456
I'm going to peel off your faces
and drink you slowly.

30:06.631 --> 30:08.690
- Just listen, you need us.
- Oh, yes.

30:08.966 --> 30:13.994
- I am thirsty.
- The plague. We know what it is.

30:14.472 --> 30:16.804
What do you know about Leviathan?

30:19.210 --> 30:20.302
A bit.

30:21.946 --> 30:24.437
You know they're poisoning
the food supply?

30:24.615 --> 30:28.415
Roman didn't mention that
when we met for dinner last fall.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.484
We made lots of plans.

30:31.022 --> 30:35.482
- We are on excellent terms, he and I.
- You sure about that?

30:36.160 --> 30:40.790
Did he mention that he was going to, uh,
Maui Wowie the human population?

30:40.965 --> 30:46.301
Oh, of course. He said grabbing a snack
would be easier than ever.

30:47.638 --> 30:50.232
He said you'd all live together, didn't he?

30:51.442 --> 30:53.034
You really believe him?

30:53.244 --> 30:55.474
You think your children are dying
by accident?

30:55.646 --> 30:57.705
There is pesticide in the formula.

30:58.015 --> 31:02.315
It suits you to think so.
You need me on your side.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.011
Look, we're not the ones
burning from the inside out.

31:05.556 --> 31:09.424
Think about it. Whatever deal he made
with you was crap. Trust us.

31:09.593 --> 31:13.085
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because we can stop Dick, stop all of it.

31:13.264 --> 31:14.925
We just...

31:15.966 --> 31:18.196
We need your blood, for the weapon.

31:20.705 --> 31:26.200
So now you want to prevent
the extermination of the vampire race?

31:26.544 --> 31:28.034
No.

31:28.979 --> 31:31.379
But it beats going down with you.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.377
Allan, darling...

31:38.055 --> 31:39.682
...come.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.888
Wow, and the creep gets creepier.

31:46.063 --> 31:48.224
- What's wrong?
- Edgar's here.

31:55.139 --> 31:57.369
Wow, what a funny coincidence. All right.

31:57.541 --> 32:01.500
We need soap, uh, cleanser,
anything with borax in it. We need knives.

32:01.746 --> 32:04.044
- Put them in the study.
- What? No, no, no.

32:04.215 --> 32:05.876
- No, wait.
- Word of advice, boys.

32:06.217 --> 32:11.280
You do not live through centuries of fire
and ice and continental divide...

32:11.889 --> 32:14.619
...by jumping to conclusions.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.225
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.259
Wait. You're making a mistake.

32:18.829 --> 32:20.490
Listen! Wait!

32:20.664 --> 32:22.928
Never hurts to get the story first.

32:26.137 --> 32:27.229
Hey! Hey!

32:41.185 --> 32:42.914
Edgar.

32:43.254 --> 32:45.688
I would have whipped you up a meal.

32:46.991 --> 32:48.253
Please. Sit.

32:49.326 --> 32:51.191
I'm dying to know why you're here.

32:52.129 --> 32:53.824
I think you know.

32:54.932 --> 32:58.800
- And how is that?
- I smell Sam and Dean Winchester.

33:10.681 --> 33:12.012
Anything?

33:12.183 --> 33:15.949
Nothing. You think Edgar's here
for the same reason we are?

33:16.120 --> 33:18.918
If they figured out that we're here
to get Alpha blood for a weapon...

33:19.089 --> 33:21.148
<i>I think you got
Pac-Man and True Blood...</i>

33:21.325 --> 33:23.316
...in the same room, and that's bad news.

33:23.494 --> 33:25.553
He's not stupid.
He locked us in here.

33:25.729 --> 33:29.665
Dean, we're his enemy, heh.
They're like monster cousins or something.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.332
Who would you give
the benefit of the doubt to?

33:32.503 --> 33:35.495
You know, maybe the sucro
is poisoning the vamps on accident.

33:35.673 --> 33:37.300
Maybe they'll fix it.

33:37.875 --> 33:40.173
I think you got
the oldest monster on Earth...

33:40.344 --> 33:43.802
...thinking that he can hold his own,
because he always has.

33:45.015 --> 33:48.178
- Edgar's gonna eat him alive.
- Yeah.

33:50.888 --> 33:52.378
Hey.

33:56.093 --> 33:58.459
You think you can pick a lock
with this?

34:00.164 --> 34:04.863
- But, Dean, we gave up all our Vamptonite.
- Did we?

34:12.576 --> 34:13.907
Do you want the boys?

34:15.379 --> 34:16.902
Yes?

34:18.248 --> 34:20.274
You're welcome to them.

34:21.351 --> 34:24.583
- I'll have them sent up.
- How kind of you.

34:24.889 --> 34:27.083
Oh, Edgar.

34:27.491 --> 34:30.289
You do know why Sam and Dean
are here, don't you?

34:32.129 --> 34:35.929
They insist that you're
exterminating us, and I thought, well...

34:36.699 --> 34:38.496
...that's impossible.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.862
Must be a mistake.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.303
You're right, of course.

34:46.744 --> 34:48.143
Mm-hm.

35:18.142 --> 35:19.507
Wow.

35:20.477 --> 35:23.071
- Vamptonite.
- Freaking Vamptonite.

35:24.448 --> 35:26.746
We need knives.
There's gotta be a prep room...

35:26.917 --> 35:29.010
...or a kitchen somewhere.
Come on.

35:29.186 --> 35:31.279
Here's what I don't understand, Edgar.

35:31.455 --> 35:34.822
You are aware that your little additive
has side effects, yes?

35:34.992 --> 35:38.985
- Dick warned you there might be kinks.
- Yes. He also said he'd be in touch.

35:39.296 --> 35:41.161
My children are in a panic.

35:41.332 --> 35:45.268
You don't call, you don't write,
you don't send cookies.

35:45.703 --> 35:49.298
Where exactly on the list
is fixing our plague?

35:54.345 --> 35:56.142
My dear friend.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.209
Nowhere.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.940
We want you to burn
like the little roaches you are.

36:04.822 --> 36:09.316
Roman said if I kept quiet,
I would get my reward.

36:09.493 --> 36:11.358
And now you get to lay down and die.

36:12.029 --> 36:13.690
Nothing personal.

36:14.131 --> 36:17.157
Our additive kills the wolves too,
the shifters...

36:17.334 --> 36:20.531
...and those disgusting little things
that eat corpses.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.034
Anything with a taste for human.

36:23.374 --> 36:25.001
Except us.

36:25.643 --> 36:27.975
Mankind's a limited resource, after all.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.476
There are seven billion of them.

36:35.486 --> 36:36.680
Only seven.

36:40.524 --> 36:42.355
- We come from you.
- Barely.

36:42.526 --> 36:44.221
I am...

36:44.428 --> 36:49.832
...the son of Eve.
A pathetic mutt. Hardly one of us.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.395
I knew Eve, and honestly...

36:55.406 --> 36:56.930
...your mommy was a whore.

37:09.353 --> 37:12.186
Don't squirm, I need every last drop.

37:23.901 --> 37:26.062
Grab a glass. We're juicing this freak.

37:26.437 --> 37:28.064
- No!
- Stay back.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.405
Leave her alone.
She's been through quite enough.

37:35.179 --> 37:39.309
That's rich, coming from the guy
who took her off the swing set.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.044
Do you want to do this fight...

37:43.620 --> 37:46.180
...or do you want my blood?

38:15.486 --> 38:18.614
For taking care of Edgar. Now go.

38:27.264 --> 38:30.358
- What about the little boy?
- Heh. Are you joking?

38:31.435 --> 38:32.959
Do we look like we're joking?

38:33.771 --> 38:36.433
How many other kids
you got in here, you freak?

38:37.741 --> 38:39.538
At the moment, just him.

38:46.950 --> 38:51.785
Emily, help Allan with his coat.
He's leaving with Sam and Dean.

38:55.526 --> 38:56.959
Now, take it.

39:08.705 --> 39:10.536
What, no thank you?

39:10.707 --> 39:12.971
Oh, right, right.

39:13.710 --> 39:16.042
Your flesh is crawling.

39:16.280 --> 39:19.181
All you really want to do
is kill me now.

39:19.783 --> 39:23.082
You hate having to wait
and come back and try again.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.149
Pretty much.

39:27.090 --> 39:30.651
I wouldn't leave that head
too close to that body for too long.

39:32.029 --> 39:33.656
See you next season.

39:34.064 --> 39:35.895
Looking forward to it.

39:44.441 --> 39:45.999
Well, let's never do that again.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.666
Cops thought
we took that kid, heh.

39:47.845 --> 39:50.279
As long as he gets back to his folks,
I don't care.

39:50.447 --> 39:52.813
We had to jump out
a freaking window, man.

40:08.932 --> 40:10.559
Bobby.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.365
Bobby?

40:12.936 --> 40:14.403
Dean.

40:15.839 --> 40:17.466
He's gone.

40:32.256 --> 40:35.248
I'm getting trace bits of EMF,
but it's fading fast.

40:35.525 --> 40:38.653
Bobby's probably been gone
three or four hours.

40:39.630 --> 40:42.394
He's got the flask.
How are we supposed to track him?

40:42.866 --> 40:45.357
- Look, I hate to say this...
- Well, then don't.

40:45.836 --> 40:47.497
He's gone, heh.

40:55.679 --> 40:57.237
How could he do this?

40:57.514 --> 40:59.539
Now? We've got half
the freaking weapon...

40:59.716 --> 41:02.583
...we're almost there.
It's not him. He's not thinking.

41:02.753 --> 41:03.913
So we just keep going...

41:04.087 --> 41:07.250
...while he's out there like this?
Do we have any other option?

41:07.891 --> 41:10.155
I mean, it's what he'd
want us to do, right?

41:11.762 --> 41:13.229
Yeah.

41:13.797 --> 41:19.360
Yeah. Him and Frank.
And Cass, if his marbles were in the bag.

41:21.738 --> 41:24.366
It's a good thing we got Crowley
in our corner, right?

41:24.541 --> 41:26.736
Seeing as how it all comes down to him.

41:28.312 --> 41:30.303
What could possibly go wrong?

41:34.751 --> 41:36.548
Hello...

41:41.091 --> 41:42.752
- ...Dick.
- Mr. Crowley.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.051
We have so much to talk about.

41:46.697 --> 41:47.994
Take a seat.
