00:06.740 --> 00:10.801
(singing along) * MAYBE IT'S
THE WAY YOU TOUCH ME *

00:10.840 --> 00:12.774
* LIKE THE WARMTH
OF THE SUN *

00:14.410 --> 00:15.729
* MAYBE IT'S THE WAY
YOU SMILE *
NOTHING.

00:15.780 --> 00:17.304
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS MY ROCK FACE.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.409
(high-pitched voice)
* COME UNDONE *

00:19.450 --> 00:20.917
YOU GOTTA GET USED
TO THIS.

00:20.950 --> 00:23.783
OH, NO, I'M USED TO IT.
I'VE HAD THREE HOURS OF IT.
* BABE *

00:23.820 --> 00:25.879
* I'M LOST IN LOVE *

00:25.920 --> 00:27.911
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS MY WEDDING SONG.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.450
HUH? HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

00:29.490 --> 00:32.857
IT WAS A GREAT DAY.
HUH? WHOA!

00:51.980 --> 00:53.447
* MY WORLD STANDS STILL *

00:53.480 --> 00:55.243
AH, IF I COULD FIND A GIRL
WHO LISTENED TO MUSIC LIKE THIS,

00:55.280 --> 00:57.714
I'D MARRY HER, TOO.
EH, I'M A LUCKY GUY.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.389
YES, YOU ARE.
* WITH YOU *

01:00.420 --> 01:01.580
(holds note)

01:01.620 --> 01:04.225
I GO'I'I'A TAKE A LEAK.
BOBBY?

01:04.260 --> 01:05.386

01:19.510 --> 01:23.469
* BABY, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH *

01:23.510 --> 01:25.148
HOW YOU DOING BACK THERE?

01:25.180 --> 01:27.148
AH, I'M A LITTLE CRAMPED,
BUT I'M OKAY.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.772
YOU ARE ONE TOUGH COOKIE,
BOBBY.

01:28.820 --> 01:31.812
NAH, NOT REALLY. I WEAR
MY HEART ON MY SLEEVE, SEE?

01:31.850 --> 01:34.250
WHEN YOUR LAST NAME'S LOVE,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, RIGHT?

01:34.290 --> 01:36.929
WOW, THAT'S A BEAUT.
THANK YOU, MY MAN.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.121
(radio chatter)

01:39.160 --> 01:41.196
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY GO'I'I'A GO NOW.

01:41.230 --> 01:43.562
(groans)
HEY, I'M SORRY, MAN.
YOU KNOW,

01:43.600 --> 01:44.862
IT'S JUST THE POWER
OF SUGGESTION.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.299
YOU KNOW, HE SAID
HE NEEDED TO GO.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.967
AT FIRST I DIDN'T NEED TO,
AND THEN NOW I DO.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.968
IF YOU WANT, I COULD JUST
GO IN THE BUSHES.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.376
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK ME IN.
NAH, IT'S FINE.
I'LL WALK YOU IN.

01:52.410 --> 01:55.277
(radio chatter)

01:58.310 --> 02:01.017
POWER OF SUGGESTION, HUH?
YEAH. WHAT, THAT NEVER
HAPPENS TO YOU?

02:01.050 --> 02:02.813
NO, MAN. I GOT A BLADDER
LIKE A CAMEL.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.249
IT'S ONE OF
MY BEST QUALITIES.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.609
OH, IS THAT SO?
(hammer cocks)

02:05.650 --> 02:07.288
DON'T MOVE.
TAKE OUT YOUR WEAPON.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.527
PUT IT ON THE GROUND
NICE AL'J'Il-l'T-IISLOW'

02:11.060 --> 02:12.425
(gun clatters on ground)

02:12.460 --> 02:13.950
YOU'RE GONNA WALK
STRAIGHT AHEAD. GO.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.267
(gun scrapes ground)

02:16.300 --> 02:17.619
KEEP GOING.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.535
GET DOWN ON THE GROUND.
ON THE GROUND!

02:19.570 --> 02:23.131
DON'T LOOK AT ME!
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

02:26.410 --> 02:30.744
(tires screech)

02:30.780 --> 02:31.940

1521,

02:34.380 --> 02:37.611
WE'RE AT THE FIRST EXIT EAST
OFF OF THE Q.E.W.,

02:37.650 --> 02:38.912
EAST OF PORT CREDIT.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.748
OUR WITNESS WAS JUST ABDUCT ED
IN A BLACK S.U.V.

02:43.660 --> 02:44.820
(female dispatcher)
Attention all cars,

02:44.860 --> 02:46.748
attention all cars...

OH, MY... GOD, SAM.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.767

02:53.800 --> 02:56.132
(laughs and panting)
(panﬁng)

02:56.170 --> 02:57.808
YOU NEVER KNOW
UNTIL YOU TRY.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.671
(chuckles softly)

02:59.710 --> 03:02.076
HOLY... MOLY.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.101
"HOLY MOLY"? (laughs)

03:04.150 --> 03:06.710
(exhales) IS THAT
THE BEST YOU GOT?

03:06.750 --> 03:08.672
"MOLY'S" NOT EVEN A WORD.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.312
YEAH, WELL, IT IS TO ME.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.489
OKAY, THEN I'LL TAKE IT.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.129
COME ON.
ONE MORE TIME.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.479
(cell phone rings)
ONE MORE.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.497
OH...

03:19.530 --> 03:21.327

03:21.360 --> 03:23.328

YEAH?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.991
O-OKAY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I'LL BE THERE.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.689
OKAY. BYE.
(beeps)

03:28.740 --> 03:30.799
I GO'I'I'A GO.
YOU ALWAYS GOTI'A GO.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.501
I REALLY GO'I'I'A GO.
FINE.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.734
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.
OKAY.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.031
(kiss)
(Sighs)

03:36.310 --> 03:37.504
SAM.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.575
WHAT?

03:39.620 --> 03:40.973
I...

03:45.450 --> 03:48.988
NOTHING.
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.750
HUH. I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.969
(cell phone ringtone playing)

03:59.000 --> 04:00.467
(ringtone continues)
(sighs)

04:00.500 --> 04:01.865
IT'S PROBABLY JUST CHRIS.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.299
I BET HE LOCKED HIMSELF
IN THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.967
(ringtone stops)

04:05.010 --> 04:06.875
(beeps)
(man in distance)
CHECK ON NUMBER 4.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.128
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA LEAVE HIM IN THERE?

04:09.180 --> 04:11.648
TEACH HIM A LESSON?
A LITTLE TOUGH LOVE?

04:11.680 --> 04:12.715
IT WAS SUE.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.116
OH.

04:15.150 --> 04:18.119
WELL, THAT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF TOUGH.

04:18.150 --> 04:20.118
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL CALL HER AFTER SHIFT.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.787
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR TWO WEEKS.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.321
THIS THING WITH CRYSTAL--

04:23.360 --> 04:24.679
IT'S NOT A THING, OKAY?
IT'S JUST I--
OKAY,

04:24.730 --> 04:25.788
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT IT IS,

04:25.830 --> 04:27.627
BUT ONE OF THESE GIRLS
IS GONNA END UP

04:27.660 --> 04:28.888
WITH A BROKEN HEART,
OKAY?

04:28.930 --> 04:31.160
THERE IS NO WAY
AROUND THAT.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.634
BUT SINCE MY MO'I'TO IS,

04:33.670 --> 04:36.195
"WHO REALLY CARES
AS LONG AS I'M HAPPY,"

04:36.240 --> 04:38.299
I WANT YOU
TO ASK YOURSELF SOMETHING.

04:38.340 --> 04:41.707
WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?
REALLY?

04:41.740 --> 04:46.518
AND IF IT'S NOT SUE,
THEN... TELL HER?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.744
(sighs) I'M GONNA GO FOR IT.

04:51.790 --> 04:52.950
YEAH, GOOD.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.150
GOOD. I AM.
YOU SHOULD.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.078
(exhales)

04:56.120 --> 04:58.850
HEY, UH, HOW LONG UNTIL YOU
AND JERRY SAID "I LOVE YOU"?

04:58.890 --> 05:00.391
(clenching teeth)
FOURTH DATE.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.556
WHAT?!

05:01.600 --> 05:02.897
ANDY! ANDY! ANDY!
SORRY!

05:02.930 --> 05:03.999
_ANDY.
(weights clatter)

05:04.030 --> 05:06.294
HOLD ON. FOURTH DATE?

05:06.340 --> 05:07.796
YEAH !

05:07.840 --> 05:10.308
I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S NORMAL, BUT...
WELL--

05:10.340 --> 05:12.262
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST WORKED FOR US.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.868
THAT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?
THAT'S WEIRD.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.775
THAT'S TOTALLY WEIRD
AND CREEPY?
NO. NO.

05:15.810 --> 05:20.042
IT'S NOT WEIRD OR CREEPY,
IT'S JUST--IT'S WILD.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.389
I KNOW.
IT'S THREE YEARS TODAY.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.388
NO WAY.
YOU GUYS CELEBRATING?

05:24.420 --> 05:27.184
NO, WE'RE... GOING TO SEE
COLDPLAY TOMORROW.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.653
I GOT US TICKETS.

05:28.690 --> 05:30.624
YEAH, WELL, YOU MUST REALLY
LOVE HIM.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.127
(laughs)

05:32.160 --> 05:34.128
HEY! YOUR EARS
MUST BE BURNING.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.297
UH, YEAH, THEY'RE BURNING.

05:35.330 --> 05:36.627
THEY'RE BURNING
LIKE THEY'RE ON FIRE.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.092
OKAY, I-I NEED YOU GUYS
IN PARADE.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.893
(scoffs)

05:39.940 --> 05:43.398
HAPPY AN NIVERSARY.
THAN KS.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.862
(radio chatter)

05:44.910 --> 05:46.707
WELL, I COULDN'T REALLY SEE HIM.
HE WAS BEHIND ME.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.538
OKAY, W--HOLD ON.
YOU SAID YOU SAW HIM

05:49.580 --> 05:51.275
WHILE HE WAS CHANGING
THE OIL, RIGHT?

05:51.310 --> 05:52.777
YEAH, BUT HE HAD HIS HAT
PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EYES.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.744
HIS COLLAR WAS UP.
OKAY, SO WHITE,
AVERAGE HEIGHT,

05:55.780 --> 05:57.543
AVERAGE WEIGHT,
BLACK PANTS,

05:57.590 --> 05:59.285
BLACK JACKET,
BLACK WOOL HAT,

05:59.320 --> 06:01.208
BLACK S.U.V.,
OBSCURED LICENSE PLATE.

06:01.260 --> 06:05.378
THANKS. THIS IS, UH...
THIS IS REALLY HELPFUL.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.125
(radio chatter continues)

06:07.160 --> 06:08.889
SO WHAT NOW?
WHAT DO WE DO?

06:08.930 --> 06:10.989
DOESN'T MATTER.
LOVE IS ALREADY DEAD.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.163
(indistinct conversations)

06:20.140 --> 06:22.301
(conversations stop)

06:26.380 --> 06:28.109
(woman clears throat)

06:28.150 --> 06:29.583
(sighs)

06:29.620 --> 06:32.555
TWO YEARS AGO, THREE BARS WERE
FIREBOMBED IN LITTLE ITALY.

06:32.590 --> 06:33.852
BURNED TO THE GROUND

06:33.890 --> 06:35.187
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T
PAY PROTECTION MONEY.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.619
TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE
WERE KILLED--

06:36.660 --> 06:38.059
A CLEANING LADY
AND A WAITRESS.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.491
DETECTIVE?

06:42.500 --> 06:44.718
(telephone rings in distance)

06:46.670 --> 06:49.969
VINCENT DELUCA.
NASTY PIECE OF WORK.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.570
BEEN TRYING TO TAKE OVER
THE STRIP SINCE HE TURNED 18.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.032
MM. I THOUGHT VINNIE
WAS GOING TO TRIAL.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.277
OH, HE IS. NEXT WEEK.

06:57.310 --> 06:59.710
YEAH, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SLAM DUNK.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.944
YOU SEE...

07:00.980 --> 07:02.516
(file clatters on desk)

07:02.550 --> 07:03.983
THIS GUY...

07:04.020 --> 07:08.150
WAS GONNA BRING DOWN
THE WHOLE UGLY OPERATION.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.658
THIS IS BOBBY LOVE,
ONE OF VINCENT'S BUDDIES.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.180
HE AGREED TO TESTIFY.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.391
IN EXCHANGE, WE DROPPED
SOME TRAFFICKING CHARGES.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.352
HE WAS IN A SAFE HOUSE
FOR A YEAR.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.426
AND HE WAS COMING TODAY
FOR THE TRIAL.
UNTIL WE LOST HIM.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.735
YEP. YEAH. HE'S THE CORNERSTONE
OF THE CASE.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.637
THERE IS NO CASE
WITHOUT BOBBY.

07:25.670 --> 07:28.434
AND THE PROSECUTION
IS HYSTERICAL.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.573
I MEAN,
EVERYONE IS HYSTERICAL.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.170
SO WE NEED... TO STAY CALM.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.108
WE ARE GONNA SPEND TONIGHT
PREPPING

07:35.150 --> 07:36.788
THE OTHER WITNESSES IN THE CASE,
MAKING SURE

07:36.820 --> 07:38.708
WE DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.559
STAFF SERGEANT BEST IS AWAY,
SO JERRY AND I

07:40.590 --> 07:43.127
WILL BE RUNNING THINGS
FROM HERE TONIGHT.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.718
LET'S GO.

07:46.330 --> 07:48.093
THREE EXPLOSIONS,
ONE EYEWITNESS--

07:48.130 --> 07:49.290
PROFESSOR MARK STERN.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.820
HE TEACHES BIOLOGY
OVER AT KEMPTON.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.361
HE WAS COMING OUT OF A STORE
ACROSS THE STREET.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.539
SOME WITNESS. GUY SAYS
HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE ANYTHING.

07:55.570 --> 07:57.401
DOESN'T MATTER. WITHOUT LOVE,
HE'S THE ONLY SHOT WE GOT,

07:57.440 --> 07:59.328
SO GET HIM IN HERE
AND GO OVER HIS TESTIMONY.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.304
HE'S GONNA BE ON THE STAND
AT LEAST A WEEK SOONER

08:01.340 --> 08:02.602
THAN WE THOUGHT.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.003
NOW AS FOR YOU,

08:04.050 --> 08:06.769
SUE TRAN WAS THE PRIMARY
E.T.F. RESPONDER

08:06.820 --> 08:08.139
ON ALL THREE FILES,

08:08.180 --> 08:09.784
SO YOU'RE GONNA GO OVER
THE DETAILS WITH HER.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.947
I WANT HER TO BE WITH SOMEONE
SHE FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.252
OKAY?
SUE?

08:13.290 --> 08:14.587
WHAT--WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.123
BOMB SQUAD BETTY. G.I. JANE.
SUE. YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.355
SUE'S THE BEST ON THE SQUAD.
SHE DOESN'T NEED PREPPING.

08:19.390 --> 08:21.096
HAVE YOU SEEN HER
ON _THE STAND?
(file clatters)

08:21.130 --> 08:23.269
NO.
I HAVE.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.188
IT'S NOT UP FOR DEBATE,
EPSTEIN.

08:25.230 --> 08:28.233
(radio chatter)

08:30.840 --> 08:32.398
SWITCH WITH ME.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.931
ARE YOU KIDDING? THIS IS
YOUR CHANCE TO TALK TO HER.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.438
EPSTEIN, CARPE DIEM.
SEIZE THE DAY.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.016
THERE'S NO TIME
LIKE THE PRESENT.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.314
A... STITCH IN TIME
SAVES NINE.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.749
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

08:43.790 --> 08:45.018
SOMETHING ABOUT SEWING,

08:45.050 --> 08:48.053
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU, MY OLD FRIEND,

08:48.090 --> 08:49.114
TO MAN UP.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.879
SO MAN UP.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.524
YOUR PEP TALK NEEDS WORK.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.162
COME ON. I JUST NEED
AN OVERTIME FORM.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.464
GET IT FROM YOUR SERGEANT.
YEAH, SHE SAID
TO GET IT FROM YOU.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.361
I DON'T CARE. HAPPY TO WORK
FOR FREE TONIGHT!

09:06.410 --> 09:08.378
(door buzzes and beeps)
HEY. HEY!

09:08.410 --> 09:11.049
LOOK, IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
TO ANY ONE OF US.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.071
YEAH, WELL, IT DIDN'T.
EVEN IF YOU MADE A MISTAKE,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.678
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB
FOR SIX MONTHS.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.017
GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.312
OFFICERS. HI.

09:17.350 --> 09:19.318
I WAS HOPING ONE OF YOU
MIGHT HAVE A MOMENT.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.784
YEAH, HE DOES.
I'M ON A BREAK.

09:21.820 --> 09:24.983
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S, UH...
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.520
I JUST WANTED TO REPORT
A CRIME.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.551
I THINK.
I MEAN, I SAW SOMETHING.
YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.818
UH... (sighs)
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING. I--

09:30.870 --> 09:32.667
SPIT IT OUT!

09:32.700 --> 09:33.962
(radio chatter)

09:34.000 --> 09:35.592
I, UH, SAW A GUY...

09:35.640 --> 09:37.699
IN THE BACK
OF A BLACK S.U.V.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.072
HE WAS TIED UP.
HE LOOKED A LITTLE ROUGH.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.108
BUT IT WAS LIKE IT WAS COVERED
IN MUD OR SOMETHING.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.902
WELL, THIS GUY--
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

09:45.950 --> 09:48.214
YOUNG GUY--MAYBE 21, 22.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.138
NICE FACE, DARK HAIR.
BIT OF A DIRTBAG.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.839
ANYTHING ELSE?

09:51.890 --> 09:53.653
BIG TATTOO ON HIS ARM.

09:53.690 --> 09:57.581
A BIG, HUGE, BLOODY,
GORY HEART.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.053
OKAY.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.625
THIS KID WITH THE TATTOO--

10:02.670 --> 10:04.194
ARE YOU SAYING HE WAS ALIVE?

10:04.230 --> 10:06.369
I THINK SO.
HIS EYES WERE OPEN.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.595
UH, THEY WERE HEADED
INTO A PARKING GARAGE.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.108
ONE OF THOSE ORANGE "G" NUMBERS.
THEY GOT 'EM ALL OVER THE CITY.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.266
SO WHICH GARAGE?

10:12.310 --> 10:15.029
UH... IT WAS, UH, SURROUNDED
BY BUILDINGS.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.672
AND, UH, THERE WAS
A HOMELESS GUY

10:16.710 --> 10:18.246
RIGHT OUTSIDE
WITH A SHOPPING CART

10:18.280 --> 10:20.441
AND SOME RED PLASTIC RIBBONS,

10:20.480 --> 10:22.072
OR--OR--OR MAYBE IT WAS TAPE.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.281
I MEAN, UH, WHERE WAS THIS ONE?

10:24.320 --> 10:26.345
WHICH PARKING GARAGE?
WE'RE GONNA NEED AN ADDRESS.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.184
I DON'T KNOW.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.051
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU SAID YOU SAW IT.

10:31.090 --> 10:34.127
I SAW IT, BUT I WASN'T THERE.

10:36.330 --> 10:37.968
(sighs)

10:38.000 --> 10:40.833
I SAW IT WITH MY MIND,
ALL RIGHT?

10:40.870 --> 10:42.292
I WOKE UP. I SAW IT HAPPENING.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.036
I FIGURED
I SHOULD TELL SOMEBODY.

10:45.070 --> 10:47.277
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC?

10:48.540 --> 10:51.373
I DON'T LOVE THAT WORD, BUT...

10:51.410 --> 10:53.344
YEAH.

10:53.380 --> 10:54.972
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYIN'.

10:55.020 --> 10:58.683
***

10:59.220 --> 11:01.381
(siren wailing)

11:01.420 --> 11:03.752
DO YOU KNOW?
READ MY PALM.

11:03.790 --> 11:07.954
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
I DON'T READ PALMS.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.468
(speaking indistinctly)
(Oliver) HE GAVE A PERFECT
DESCRIPTION OF THE WITNESS.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.627
SAM, THIS ISN'T IN THE PRESS.
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED,

11:12.670 --> 11:14.968
SAVE OUR OFFICERS
AND, UH, TWO PROSECUTORS

11:15.000 --> 11:16.809
AND SOME OF THE GUYS
IN GUNS AND GANGS.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.138
I THINK MAYBE--MAYBE
HE'S ONE OF VINCENT'S GUYS.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.638
YOU KNOW, DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE--
WHATEVER, I DON'T KNOW.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.342
DARIUS COSTA.
36 YEARS OLD.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.644
RUNS A BAKERY IN ETOBICOKE.
NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.817
(Jerry) MARRIED?
NO.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.169
KIDS?
NOPE.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.642
WEIRDO.
(scoffs)

11:30.690 --> 11:32.817
WHAT? I'M STRESSED.
I DON'T NEED TO MAKE SENSE.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.351
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
WE'RE GONNA TAKE HIM OUT,

11:35.390 --> 11:37.119
AND WE'RE GONNA
DRIVE HIM AROUND...
WHAT?

11:37.160 --> 11:38.457
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE
WHAT HE KNOWS

11:38.490 --> 11:40.128
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE
HOW HE KNOWS IT.
JERRY--

11:40.160 --> 11:41.889
WHAT? I'M SCREWED.
WH-WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

11:41.930 --> 11:43.693
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S MADAME LULU

11:43.730 --> 11:45.493
OR THE WORLD'S DUMBEST
INSIDE MAN.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.361
EITHER WAY, HE KNOWS
MORE THAN WE DO, SO LET'S--

11:47.400 --> 11:49.391
LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.

11:50.870 --> 11:51.859
(telephones ringing)

11:51.910 --> 11:53.832
I'VE HAD
A REALLY LONG DAY, MAN.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.074
(chair wheels roll)

11:56.380 --> 11:59.099
MR. COSTA, WE'RE GOING
FOR A RIDE, PLEASE.

11:59.150 --> 12:00.947
GUYS, I ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.915
I DON'T WANT TO GET
INVOLVED.
TOO LATE!

12:03.950 --> 12:05.679
(machine humming)

12:05.720 --> 12:07.915
(pounding on machine)

12:07.960 --> 12:09.188
(machine rattling)

12:09.220 --> 12:11.188
WANT ME TO BLOW IT UP
FOR YOU?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.424
HEY.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.155
200 GRAMS OF DET CORD
AND A BLASTING CAP,

12:14.200 --> 12:15.952
WE'D BE KNEE-DEEP IN SODA
IN NO TIME.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.389
I--HOW YOU DOING?

12:18.430 --> 12:21.297
(both chuckle)
I FEEL LIKE I, UH,
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN, UH...

12:21.340 --> 12:23.035
TEN DAYS?

12:23.070 --> 12:24.207
(chuckles)

12:24.240 --> 12:26.231
UH, IT'S OKAY.
I-I'VE BEEN BUSY--

12:26.270 --> 12:28.534
THIS TRIAL THING.
I'VE HEARD.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.548
(sighs) DOV, YOU HAVE
NO IDEA.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.104
LIKE, IT MAKES ME...
NAUSEOUS,

12:32.150 --> 12:33.913
UH--UH, JUST TALKING
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE,

12:33.950 --> 12:35.941
AND EVERYONE STARING, I--

12:35.980 --> 12:37.811
OH, GOD. LOOK.
MY MOUTH IS WATERING.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.386
I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.388
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.024
(sighs)
HEY, AND IF YOU NEED TO,

12:43.060 --> 12:44.527
YOU COULD ALWAYS MIME
YOUR TESTIMONY.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.358
OR... DO A LITTLE, UH,
INTERPRETIVE DANCE.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.027
YEAH? WHATNDCJ) YOU THINK?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.288
NO?
NO.

12:51.630 --> 12:53.666
HEY, UH, DO YOU THINK
THAT AFTER WORK,

12:53.700 --> 12:55.292
WE COULD, UH, MAYBE HAVE
BREAKFAST

12:55.340 --> 12:56.739
AND HAVE A LITTLE TALK?

12:56.770 --> 12:59.500
UH... Y-YEAH.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.077
OR WE COULD DO IT NOW,

13:02.110 --> 13:03.668
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO CONCENTRATE

13:03.710 --> 13:05.803
NOW THAT YOU SAID THE WORDS
"HAVE A TALK."

13:05.850 --> 13:07.511
(Noelle) OFFICER TRAN.
THAT'S GREAT.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.916
UH, LET'S GET YOU TWO SETTLED,
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.339
(sighs)
(radio chatter)

13:12.390 --> 13:13.687
(indistinct conversations)

13:13.720 --> 13:16.780
(Traci speaking indistinctly)

13:16.830 --> 13:19.151
TRACE.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.226
JUST, UH--JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.927
I FOUND THESE ON MY DESK.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.465
IT'S OKAY
IF YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.865
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON
TODAY.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.105
NO, NO. I, UH...
I REMEMBERED.

13:32.140 --> 13:35.303
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A SUCKER FOR NOSTALGIA.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.649
(laughing) JERRY!

13:37.680 --> 13:39.671
(cell phone ringtone playing)
OOH.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.348
(beeps)
JUST--

13:41.380 --> 13:43.587
OKAY, BEFORE YOU LAUNCH IN,
I JUST--

13:43.620 --> 13:45.019
YEAH.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.950
(speaks indistinctly)

13:46.990 --> 13:48.480
YEAH.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.987
NO.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.681
LOOK, THAT'S FINE,
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY...

13:52.730 --> 13:55.290
(speaking indistinctly)

13:56.970 --> 13:58.767
WHAT'D YOU GET?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.831
(radio chatter)

14:01.870 --> 14:05.067
WOW. YOU GUYS MUST HAVE
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.236
SICK!

14:06.270 --> 14:08.409
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A STAINLESS STEEL HOSKO.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.634
IS THAT A WALNUT HANDLE?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.102
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST PRESENT

14:11.150 --> 14:12.447
THAT JERRY EVER GAVE ME
WAS A KNIFE,

14:12.480 --> 14:15.472
SO I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF... SWEET.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.514
YEAH, SURE, IF YOU'RE
A... BACKWOODS PIONEER WOMAN.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.187
(woman over P.A.) OFFICER PECK,
OFFICER DIAZ,

14:22.220 --> 14:23.357
PLEASE REPORT TO RECEPTION.

14:23.390 --> 14:24.584
ALL RIGHT.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.780
OKAY, THAT MUST BE OUR WITNESS.
LET'S GO, DIAZ.

14:26.830 --> 14:29.651
UH, ENJOY
YOUR ANNIVERSARY SHIV.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.364
(sniffing)
(radio chatter)

14:34.400 --> 14:37.267
I GOTTA TELL YOU, IT DOESN'T
SMELL SO FRESH BACK HERE.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.460
(sniffs) MAYBE YOU GUYS
SHOULD SPEND A SHIFT BACK HERE,

14:39.510 --> 14:40.704
SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE.
(sighs)

14:40.740 --> 14:43.641
KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU SPEND
A NIGHT IN YOUR OWN GUEST ROOM.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.147
MAKE SURE IT'S UP TO SCRATCH

14:45.180 --> 14:46.499
BEFORE YOU STICK
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW IN IT.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.142
I DON'T HAVE
A MOTHER-IN-LAW.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.580
HEY.
WHAT? I DON'T.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.542
YEAH, WELL,
YOU MIGHT SOMEDAY.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.558
(horn honking and passing)

14:54.590 --> 14:56.558
YOU'RE RIGHT, MCNALLY.
MAYBE I WILL SOMEDAY.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.353
THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND
OF RIGOROUS THINKING

14:58.390 --> 15:00.255
THAT'S GOT US OUT HERE
TONIGHT

15:00.300 --> 15:02.655
LOOKING FOR IMAGINARY
PARKING GARAGES.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.759
HEY, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.496
(radio chatter,
brakes screeching)

15:07.540 --> 15:10.668
HEY, UH, DARIUS,
HOW DOES THIS ONE LOOK?

15:10.710 --> 15:13.201
UH, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T--
I DON'T SEE ANY RED RIBBONS.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.878
YEAH, OKAY.
(clears throat)

15:14.910 --> 15:16.878
WELL, WHY DON'T I GO
AND HAVE A BOO...
(seat belt unfastens)

15:16.910 --> 15:18.605
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
INSIDE? (Sighs)
(door opens)

15:20.680 --> 15:22.375
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT SAYING IT,

15:22.420 --> 15:24.342
BUT IF I WERE YOU...

15:24.390 --> 15:25.789
SAYING WHAT?

15:25.820 --> 15:27.856
I GET IT. IT MAKES SENSE.
YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER, WHAT,

15:27.890 --> 15:29.312
TWO YEARS NOW?

15:29.360 --> 15:32.523
(smacks lips) NOPE. SORRY.
GUESS YOU'RE WRONG.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.528
(radio chatter continues)

15:34.560 --> 15:38.690
WELL, EITHER WAY, HE'S, UH,
NOT GONNA SAY IT BACK.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.891
AH, IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T SAY IT.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.204
IT JUST MEANS YOU GOTTA
MODIFY YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.662
WH-WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:44.710 --> 15:46.974
GUY'S WHAT, MID-30$?
MM-HMM.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.228
BET HE'S NEVER SAID
"I LOVE YOU" IN HIS LIFE.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.872
(radio static)
(Swarek) Oh, what a Shocker!

15:50.910 --> 15:53.378
Third garage,
still no Sign of Bobby Love.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.547
I think it might be time
to send our psychotic--

15:55.580 --> 15:57.548
I mean, uh, psychic--
home.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.989
(radio static)
SAM.

15:59.020 --> 16:02.387
On my way.
(radio static)

16:02.420 --> 16:05.082
HE'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THIS.
(chuckles)

16:05.130 --> 16:07.690
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

16:07.730 --> 16:09.948
UH, I WALK OUT OF THE STORE,
I TURN EAST ON COLLEGE.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.490
AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS,
I HEAR A BOOM.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.997
I TURN AROUND,
THE BAR'S EXPLODED.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.439
THERE--THERE'S FLAMES
IN THE WINDOWS,

16:14.470 --> 16:16.438
SMOKE EVERWVHERE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST HOLD ON,
PROFESSOR STERN.

16:16.470 --> 16:17.903
UH, MARK.
OKAY. MARK.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.237
CAN WE JUST SLOW IT DOWN
A LITTLE?

16:19.270 --> 16:22.000
YEAH.
(slowly) I, UH, S--

16:22.040 --> 16:24.474
SEE FLAMES... AND...

16:24.510 --> 16:25.977
(laughs)
SMOKE.

16:26.010 --> 16:28.319
YEAH, HE--HE MEANS
YOUR--YOUR STORY.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.545
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.
START FROM THE BEGINNING.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.081
SO YOU'RE IN A CORNER STORE
ON COLLEGE.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.350
IT'S, WHAT, 3:00 A.M.?

16:35.390 --> 16:36.482
I-IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
IN THE STORE?

16:36.520 --> 16:38.556
NOPE. JUST THE GUY
AT THE COUNTER.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.854
SO YOU COME OUTSIDE.
IS THERE ANYONE ON THE STREET?

16:40.900 --> 16:43.721
UH, THERE'S SOME KIDS
IN... A DOORWAY.

16:43.770 --> 16:48.059
UH, PASS BY A GUY IN
A BLACK JACKET ON THE SIDEWALK,

16:48.100 --> 16:52.503
AND I THINK THERE'S A--A WOMAN
COLLECTING BOTTLES.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.599
(file clatters)
HEY, GUYS, I... (sighs)

16:54.640 --> 16:56.130
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I SAW.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.944
UH, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
ON COLLEGE THAT NIGHT?

16:58.980 --> 17:00.470
MY BOY HAD A FEVER.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.978
I WAS, UH, TRYING TO FIND
A STORE THAT SOLD BABY ASPIRIN.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.181
I REALLY FEEL
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.552
I AM GONNA GO AND GET A SODA.

17:08.590 --> 17:09.557
I'M GONNA GRAB SOMETHING
AS WELL.

17:09.590 --> 17:11.126
YOU WANTNSbOMETHING?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.025
ALL RIGHT, JUST SIT TIGHT.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.459
(door closes)

17:14.500 --> 17:15.455
LIAR, LIAR?

17:15.500 --> 17:16.797
PANTS TOTALLY ON FIRE.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.388
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A MAN
IN A BLACK JACKET?

17:18.430 --> 17:19.920
HE NEVER MENTIONED
THAT BEFORE.

17:19.970 --> 17:21.289
WHY IS HE LYING TO US?

17:21.340 --> 17:23.558
MAYBE NOW HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.473
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE
WORKING IN A BAKERY?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.512
IT'S FINE.

17:34.950 --> 17:36.372
IT'S NICE.

17:36.420 --> 17:38.718
I SPEND THE FIRST TWO HOURS
OF EVERY DAY MEASURING THINGS.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.149
IT'S VERY ZEN.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.613
I GUESS IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF
TIME TO DREAM STUFF UP, HUH?

17:42.660 --> 17:44.457
IN YOUR OFF HOURS.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.082
THAT'S NOT REALLY
HOW IT WORKS.

17:46.130 --> 17:49.224
OH, NO? YOU WANNA
TELL US HOW IT WORKS?

17:49.260 --> 17:52.525
YOU WANNA TELL ME WHY
I MAKE YOU SO UNCOMFORTABLE?

17:52.570 --> 17:54.299
HEY. THERE'S ONE
RIGHT THERE.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.932
LOOK, IT EVEN HAS
RED RIBBONS.

17:55.970 --> 17:58.700
AND... A HOMELESS GUY
WITH A CART.

18:03.510 --> 18:05.000
(gearshift clicks)

18:05.050 --> 18:08.417
"CLOSED FOR REPAIRS."
HOW CONVENIENT.

18:08.450 --> 18:12.216
(radio static)
1519, UH,
WE FOUND A PARKING GARAGE

18:12.250 --> 18:14.718
THAT MATCHES OUR WITNESS
DESCRIPTION.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.456
IT'S THE ORANGE "G"
AT PARK AND 3rd.

18:17.490 --> 18:20.254
SHAW, COLLINS, WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS COME DOWN HERE

18:20.300 --> 18:22.495
AND JOIN US FOR A LOOK?
(radio static)

18:22.530 --> 18:26.421
(radio chatter)

18:28.870 --> 18:30.906
MCNALLY, COLLINS,
YOU CHECK THIS FLOOR.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.259
WE'LL HEAD TO P2.

18:32.310 --> 18:36.132
MAYBE HIT P3. MIGHT EVEN
GET ALL THE WAY TO P4.

18:36.180 --> 18:39.172
IF YOU SEE ANY GHOSTS,
YELL "BOO!"

18:39.210 --> 18:41.144
IF YOU SEE
ANY WEREWOLVES...

18:41.180 --> 18:42.477
(radio chatter continues)

18:42.520 --> 18:48.459
(howls)

18:48.490 --> 18:51.527
HE'S--HE'S NOT ALWAYS
LIKE THIS.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.621
HEY, WH-WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THE PSYCHIC?

18:55.660 --> 18:57.867
I'M NOT SURE.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.629
I THINK THERE ARE
MAYBE PEOPLE OUT THERE

18:59.670 --> 19:01.934
WHO KNOW THINGS WE DON'T--
PEOPLE WITH GIFTS

19:01.970 --> 19:04.006
OR INSIGHTS OR...

19:04.040 --> 19:05.632
I DON'T KNOW.

19:05.670 --> 19:09.629
MAYBE THEY JUST PAY
CLOSER ATTENTION TO STUFF.
YEAH, MAYBE.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.204
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
I WAS IN KANDAHAR,

19:11.250 --> 19:13.002
AND THIS BUDDY OF MINE--
GUY I'D KNOWN TWO YEARS--

19:13.050 --> 19:14.449
HE SAID TO_ ME...
(gate rattling)

19:14.480 --> 19:16.448
"I THINK--"
NICK. NICK.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.516
(unholsters gun)

19:18.550 --> 19:21.610
(engine rumbling)

19:21.660 --> 19:24.879
(radio static)
SAM, WE HAVE A BLACK S.U.V.
ENTERING THE GARAGE.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.386
(radio static)

19:32.530 --> 19:33.838
(brakes screech)

19:33.870 --> 19:34.996
POLICE! DON'T MOVE!

19:35.040 --> 19:36.598
(tires screeching)

19:39.110 --> 19:42.170
NICK!

19:42.210 --> 19:44.098
(tires screeching)

19:44.150 --> 19:46.038
YOU OKAY?
YEAH. YOU?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.513
(panting) YEAH.

19:49.120 --> 19:55.389
***

19:55.420 --> 19:58.719
(radio chatter)

19:58.760 --> 19:59.954
COME ON, GET OUT.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.424
LOOK! I-I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE COMING.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.996
I-I FIGURED THEY'D ALREADY
BEEN THERE.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.167
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO

20:05.200 --> 20:06.428
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER
THAN THAT, PAL.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.290
(radio chatter)

20:08.340 --> 20:11.161
YOU OKAY?
YEAH. FINE.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.770
IT'S THE CRYSTAL BALL
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

20:13.810 --> 20:16.631
(doors buzz in distance)

20:16.680 --> 20:18.477
(door buzzes and beeps)

20:18.510 --> 20:20.512
DID A LITTLE DIGGING
ON DARIUS.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.177
TURNS OUT
HE'S MARRIED TO THE MOB.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.519
WELL, NOT HIM.
HIS LITTLE SISTER--LISA DELUCA.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.040
HIS SISTER'S MARRIED
TO VINNIE DELUCA?

20:27.090 --> 20:29.411
SO HE IS AN INSIDE GUY.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.382
DOESN'T WANT TO TESTIFY
AGAINST HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW,

20:31.430 --> 20:33.421
BUT STILL WANTS TO MAKE SURE
HE GOES TO PRISON, HUH?

20:33.460 --> 20:34.791
TO TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS
OR SOMETHING?

20:34.830 --> 20:36.320
I MEAN, THE GUY DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE A RECORD.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.964
YEAH, THE SMARTEST ONES
DON'T.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.763
OKAY, BUT HE'S OUR ONLY
LINK TO BOBBY LOVE,

20:39.800 --> 20:43.258
AND HE WANTS TO FIND HIM
AS MUCH AS WE DO, RIGHT?

20:43.310 --> 20:45.437
(door buzzes and beeps)

20:48.940 --> 20:50.942
(doors buzz in distance)

20:51.950 --> 20:54.418
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

20:54.450 --> 20:56.839
I ALREADY--I ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I SAW.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.279
N-NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.639
YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHO WE WERE LOOKING FOR,

20:59.690 --> 21:01.487
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU KNOW WHO TOOK HIM.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.556
HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?
YOUR SISTER--LISA DELUCA.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.455
YOU'RE VINCENT'S
BROTHER-IN-LAW. COME ON.

21:05.490 --> 21:06.787
(slaps clipboard on thigh)

21:06.830 --> 21:08.752
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
VINNIE'S GOING ON TRIAL.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.222
HIS FRIENDS
CERTAINLY KNOW--

21:10.260 --> 21:12.569
I'M NOT FRIENDS WITH THAT MAN.
I DO NOT SPEAK TO THAT MAN.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.465
HOW ABOUT YOUR SISTER?

21:14.500 --> 21:16.991
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN THREE YEARS.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.439
EVERYTHING I SAW,
I DREAMT, ALL RIGHT?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.368
THE GUY WITH THE TATTOO--
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

21:22.410 --> 21:25.641
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
BEFORE.
YEAH, I GET IT.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.477
WE'RE GONNA DEAL
WITH THAT LATER.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.542
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW--

21:32.490 --> 21:37.359
BOBBY LOVE, OUR WITNESS,
THE GUY YOU SAW--

21:37.390 --> 21:39.051
WHERE IS HE RIGHT NOW?

21:40.360 --> 21:41.657
I DON'T KNOW.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.463
YOU NEED, UH, TAROT CARDS?

21:43.500 --> 21:44.694
OR A LOCK OF BOBBY'S HAIR?

21:44.730 --> 21:47.335
SEE, MAYBE A PHONE
TO CALL YOUR SISTER.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.531
(taps desk)
NO?

21:49.570 --> 21:52.038
OKAY, FINE. WE'RE DONE.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.401
(filtered voice)
BOOK HIM ON OBSTRUCT ION

21:53.440 --> 21:55.078
AND THROW HIM INTO HOLDING
UNTIL WE GET, UH,

21:55.110 --> 21:57.578
LOU DOWN HERE
FROM GUNS AND GANGS.

21:57.610 --> 22:01.239
AND THAT... WILL PROBABLY NOT
BE TILL TOMORROW MORNING.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.817
ENJOY.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.784
(door buzzes and beeps)
(sighs)

22:05.820 --> 22:08.482
YOU LIVE HERE.
IS THAT RIGHT?

22:08.520 --> 22:10.784
SO YOU'RE TELLING US THAT
YOU WENT TO BUY BABY ASPIRIN

22:10.830 --> 22:14.288
IN A CORNER STORE
ON COLLEGE STREET HERE,

22:14.330 --> 22:15.627
18 BLOCKS FROM YOUR HOUSE?

22:15.660 --> 22:17.389
I MEAN, WHY NOT JUST GO
TO THE ALL-NIGHT DRUGSTORE

22:17.430 --> 22:19.466
TWO BLOCKS FROM HOME?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.092
THE NIGHT
OF THE FIREBOMBING,

22:21.140 --> 22:23.358
YOU NEVER MENTIONED ANYONE
WITH A BLACK JACKET.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.366
NO, I-I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS IMPORTANT.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.604
WHY WERE YOU THERE
THAT NIGHT?

22:26.640 --> 22:29.177
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED
TO GO TO THE STORE.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.740
WHY?

22:33.350 --> 22:35.215
I WAS...

22:36.680 --> 22:40.958
TRYING TO FIND, UH,
LITTLE GLASS GINSENG VIALS.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.252
YOU'RE AN ADDICT.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.458
YOU'RE A GINSENG ADDICT?

22:44.490 --> 22:47.050
THE VIALS--

22:47.090 --> 22:48.853
THEY'RE GOOD
FOR SMOKING CRACK.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.427
I WAS AN ADDICT. I AM NOT
ANYMORE. I'M CLEAN NOW.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.165
(breathes deeply)

22:54.200 --> 22:57.135
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT THIS
IN YOUR REPORT, ARE YOU?

22:57.170 --> 22:58.330
'CAUSE NOBODY KNOWS
ABOUT THIS--

22:58.370 --> 23:01.009
NOT MY FRIENDS,
MY COLLEAGUES--NO ONE.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.803
I'M CLEAN NOW, I SWEAR.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.376
I DON'T TOUCH THE STUFF
ANYMORE--

23:04.410 --> 23:06.970
NONE OF WHICH IS EVEN RELEVANT
TO MY WITNESS STATEMENT.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.944
RIGHT NOW
YOU ARE EXTREMELY RELEVANT.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.481
IN FACT, YOU MIGHT BE
THE BEST CHANCE WE HAVE

23:10.520 --> 23:11.839
OF PUTTING DELUCA AWAY.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.778
YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF
I WON'T TESTIFY?

23:13.820 --> 23:15.651
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

23:15.690 --> 23:19.353
(clicks tongue and sighs)

23:19.390 --> 23:20.721
SO, OFFICER TRAN,

23:20.760 --> 23:23.058
IF YOU COULD RUN IT THROUGH
ONE MORE TIME

23:23.100 --> 23:25.625
IN YOUR OWN WORDS.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.695
UH, OKAY.
UH, TEAM, UM--

23:27.740 --> 23:30.766
TEAM TWO A-ARRIVED
ON SCENE.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.437
I WAS TANGO 1.

23:32.470 --> 23:34.472
OR--NO, NO.
D-DUKE WAS TANGO 1.

23:34.510 --> 23:37.331
BUT, UM... BUT--BUT WE WERE
IN THE SAME CAR, SO--
START AGAIN.

23:37.380 --> 23:40.474
(sighs) OKAY.
WE ARRIVED ON SCENE.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.875
MAYBE I SHOULD SAY,
"WE ARRIVED AT THE SCENE."

23:42.920 --> 23:44.239
I-I DON'T KNOW.
OR WHATEVER.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.214
OR, NO--NO! I SH-SHOULDN'T
SAY "WHATEVER," I--

23:47.250 --> 23:48.956
OH! THAT SOUNDS LIKE
I DON'T CARE.

23:48.990 --> 23:50.787
OKAY. HERE'S AN IDEA.

23:50.830 --> 23:55.324
LET'S JUST PRETEND THAT
YOU ARE IN MY LIVING ROOM.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.488
YOU, UH--YOU CAME BY
FOR, UH--FOR DINNER.
(exhales Sharply)

24:01.370 --> 24:02.496
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

24:02.540 --> 24:05.236
ROUGH? I CAN TELL.
UH, GRAB YOU A BEER?

24:05.270 --> 24:07.306
(sighs and chuckles)
I'M FINE.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.671
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

24:08.710 --> 24:11.577
IT... IS...

24:11.610 --> 24:13.305
TAPAS.

24:13.350 --> 24:14.510
(laughs)

24:14.550 --> 24:16.438
I CAN SEE THAT.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.414
(inhales and exhales)

24:18.450 --> 24:20.247
WHAT'D YOU DO TODAY?

24:20.290 --> 24:23.088
I WENT TO A BOMB CALL
AT TEMPO PERSO IN LITTLE ITALY.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.587
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
I HEARD THAT ON THE RADIO.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.780
WHAT WAS THE DEAL?
OH, SOME MOBBED-UP MORON

24:26.830 --> 24:28.593
THREW AN IMPROVISED
INCENDIARY DEVICE

24:28.630 --> 24:30.689
THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW.
YEAH? WHAT WAS IT?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.129
GLASS BOTTLE WITH A WICK.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.694
LAB REPORT SAID IT WAS
ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.537
YOU KNOW, WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS,

24:35.570 --> 24:36.798
HOW DOES A LITTLE BOTTLE
OF ALCOHOL

24:36.840 --> 24:38.102
BLOW UP
AN ENTIRE RESTAURANT?

24:38.140 --> 24:40.529
OH. WELL, YOU...

24:40.580 --> 24:42.138
FILL A BOTTLE HALFWAY

24:42.180 --> 24:44.398
SO THE OTHER HALF FILLS
WITH FUEL VAPORS.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.418
IN A SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT,
THE VAPORS IGNITE,

24:48.450 --> 24:50.816
BOTTLE BREAKS APART,
WHICH ADDS OXYGEN TO THE MIX,

24:50.850 --> 24:52.408
AND THAT FUELS THE EXPLOSION
AND CREATES

24:52.450 --> 24:54.054
A LARGE FIREBALL
IN EXTREME HEAT.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.217
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.887
(laughs)
WHOO!

24:57.930 --> 24:59.158
SEE?
OH, MY GOD!

24:59.190 --> 25:00.623
HMM?
MMM! THANK YOU.

25:00.660 --> 25:01.957
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.
OHH!

25:02.000 --> 25:05.026
(laughs)
(sighs)

25:07.300 --> 25:10.269
(indistinct conversations)

25:16.710 --> 25:18.143
WHAT A NIGHT. (sighs)

25:18.180 --> 25:19.647
MY STAR WITNESS
IS MISSING--

25:19.680 --> 25:21.079
PROBABLY DEAD.

25:21.120 --> 25:25.614
MY OTHER WITNESS IS
A RECOVERING CRACK ADDICT.

25:25.650 --> 25:29.154
AND I'D BE SURPRISED IF SUE
REMEMBERS HER OWN NAME

25:29.190 --> 25:30.748
WHEN SHE GETS UP
ON THE STAND.

25:33.390 --> 25:35.290
BUT AT LEAST WE'RE TOGETHER
ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

25:35.330 --> 25:37.821
THAT'S TRUE.
THAT IS TRUE.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.259
WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF YOUR PRESENT?

25:40.300 --> 25:43.360
I THOUGHT...

25:43.400 --> 25:45.834
IT WAS NEAT.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.933
"N-NEAT"?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.141
JERRY, IT'S A KNIFE.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.819
YOU GOT ME A KNIFE...

25:53.850 --> 25:55.010
AGAIN .

25:55.050 --> 25:57.268
YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT IT,
DID YOU?

25:57.320 --> 26:00.858
SURE. IT'S... GREAT.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.482
AND IF YOU EVER CELEBRATE

26:02.520 --> 26:04.158
YOUR 3-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
WITH CHRIS,

26:04.190 --> 26:05.623
IT'LL BE THE PERFECT GIFT.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.457
OKAY THEN.

26:07.490 --> 26:10.618
(Traci sighs)

26:10.670 --> 26:12.194
JER--

26:12.230 --> 26:15.563
***

26:17.840 --> 26:20.707
(door buzzes and beeps)

26:20.740 --> 26:22.708
(door closes)

26:22.740 --> 26:24.571
(radio chatter)

26:24.610 --> 26:27.408
WASN'T SURE
HOW YOU TOOK IT.
THANKS.

26:27.450 --> 26:30.578
BUDDY, YOU GOTTA HAVE
A LITTLE FAITH.

26:30.620 --> 26:33.088
IN WHAT?
YOURSELF.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.378
YOUR WERE THERE
AT THAT GARAGE, RIGHT?
YEAH.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.524
YOU PROBABLY SAW MORE
THAN YOU THINK YOU DID.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.791
NO. BLACK S.U.V.
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.195
THESE GUYS GOT THE DROP
ON ME TWICE TODAY.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.289
I CAN'T EVEN GIVE A DESCRIPTION.
THE GUY HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD.

26:45.330 --> 26:48.037
THAT GUY--DO YOU WANNA
TALK IT THROUGH?

26:48.070 --> 26:49.389
OKAY.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.908
OKAY, SO...

26:51.940 --> 26:54.977
WHEN THERE'S ONLY DARKNESS,
YOU GOTTA FOCUS ON THE LIGHT.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.477
(chuckles)

26:56.510 --> 27:00.241
JUST, UH, SQUINT YOUR EYES.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.510
WELL, IT'S--
IT'S DARK DOWN THERE,

27:02.550 --> 27:04.017
AND IT'S DARK UP HERE.

27:04.050 --> 27:07.486
SO WHAT'S IN BETWEEN?
EYES, EARS,
BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.318
WHAT COLOR ARE THE EYES?
BLUE.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.782
NOSE?

27:11.830 --> 27:14.697
AH... NOTHING.
I-I CAN'T SEE.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.322
EARS?
NOTHING.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.225
NO, UH, EARRINGS OR--

27:18.270 --> 27:20.465
NOT EARRINGS.
THERE'S HOLES FOR EARRINGS.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.536
HOW MANY?
TH REE.

27:22.570 --> 27:24.435
WHICH EAR?

27:26.240 --> 27:28.299
HIS RIGHT.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.501
(crunches)

27:35.920 --> 27:38.889
(door buzzes and beeps)

27:38.920 --> 27:41.252
WE LOOKED INTO ALL OF--
ALL OF THAT.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.656
YEAH. YEAH.

27:43.690 --> 27:46.284
COLLINS.
I JUST NEED A SEC.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.525
LOU, I GOT--UH, LOU,
I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.221
(cell phone beeps)

27:50.260 --> 27:52.091
BUDDY, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
THESE--EVERY SINGLE ONE.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.860
IT'S HIM, JERRY.
THAT'S THE GUY.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.877
(key clicks, monitor beeps)
HERE WE GO.
TONY RIZZO-MORE'I'I'I.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.673
VINCENT'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.

28:04.710 --> 28:07.873
(tapping and beeping continue)
ASSAULT, TRAFFICKING,
A COUPLE OF D.U.I.s.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.512
AND WHAT DOES HE DRIVE?

28:09.550 --> 28:11.381
BLACK S.U.V.
(taps keys)

28:11.420 --> 28:14.116
PLATE AZAA 707.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.014
TWO NAMES. TONY TWO-NAMES.
YOU GOT AN ADDRESS?

28:16.060 --> 28:17.516
YES, I DO.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.188
TONY TWO-NAMES, BOBBY LOVE--
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

28:26.370 --> 28:27.962
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.468
I COULDN'T FIND YOU, SO I JUST
PICKED UP A SANDWICH.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.162
UH... WH-WHAT'S THIS?

28:33.210 --> 28:35.178
MY PRESENT FROM JERRY.
(door closes)

28:35.210 --> 28:37.576
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS,

28:37.610 --> 28:39.601
AND THE GUY STILL HAS
NO IDEA WHO I AM.

28:39.650 --> 28:42.016
TRY NOT TO TAKE THAT
AS A BAD SIGN.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.608
(crunches)
WHOA.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.618
WHAT?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.080
HOLY CRAP.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.787
HOLY CRAP!

28:54.430 --> 28:56.990
HEY! HELLO! SOMEBODY!

28:57.030 --> 28:59.089
ALL RIGHT!
(pounding)

28:59.130 --> 29:01.064
(door buzzes and beeps)
I'M GONNA KEEP ON YELLING

29:01.100 --> 29:03.330
UNTIL SOMEBODY COMES IN HERE
AND TALKS TO ME!

29:03.370 --> 29:06.168
(kicks object)
BUDDY! WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

29:06.210 --> 29:07.939
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.
WHO?

29:07.980 --> 29:09.436
THE WITNESS.
THE GUY I SAW BEFORE.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.970
THE GUY WITH THE HEART
ON HIS ARM.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.478
THERE'S, UH, A BIG SILO
NEAR THE WATER.

29:13.510 --> 29:16.070
UH, TWO SILOS.
BIG EMPTY PARKING LOT.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.179
DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
AN ADDRESS.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.687
NOT, BUT--

29:19.720 --> 29:21.711
COME ON. PLEASE.
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.886
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.286
BUT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
ME OF ALL PEOPLE?

29:25.330 --> 29:27.286
YOU KNOW HOW TO BELIEVE
WHEN IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.127
ODDS SAID IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN FOR YOU,

29:29.160 --> 29:31.128
BUT THEN, BOOM.
WAIT, WAIT--

29:31.170 --> 29:33.297
I DON'T LIKE STRANGERS
COMMENTING ON MY PERSONAL LIFE.

29:33.330 --> 29:34.695
AND I DON'T LIKE
BEING IN HERE.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.038
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
PLEASE? LET ME HELP.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.039
(suspension rattling)

29:40.070 --> 29:43.949
GREAT. OKAY. SO TWO SILOS
BY THE WATER.

29:43.980 --> 29:46.369
Is there any way
to narrow that down?

29:46.410 --> 29:47.479
I CAN'T.

29:47.510 --> 29:48.738
HE CAN'T.

29:48.780 --> 29:52.489
FINE. THEN WE'LL JUST
KEEP GOIN'.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.909
YOU KNOW, THIS SHTICK
IS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.848
I'M 38, NO WEDDING BAND.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.221
IT DOESN'T TAKE A PSYCHIC
TO FIGURE OUT

29:58.260 --> 29:59.921
THAT THIS PREGNANCY
WAS A LITTLE HARD-WON.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.724
JUST SAYING.
OKAY.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.389
(suspension rattling)

30:07.430 --> 30:10.297
(beeping, radio chatter)

30:13.980 --> 30:15.538
UH, ANDY?

30:23.250 --> 30:26.742
(radio chatter and static)

30:31.390 --> 30:33.358
WHEN EVERYTHING'S DARK,

30:33.390 --> 30:36.951
YOU GOTTA LOOK BEHIND
A DUMPSTER.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.264
(radio chatter)
NOELLE, I THINK
WE GOT SOMETHING.

30:40.830 --> 30:43.765
MCNALLY, WE GOT 'EM.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.031
***

30:48.280 --> 30:50.271
(lowered voice) YEAH, WE'RE
JUST GONNA TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

30:50.310 --> 30:52.699
(Noelle) McNally, stay put.
I'm calling for backup now.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.639
(cell phone beeps)
THIS IS WILLIAMS CALLING
ON BEHALF OF 1519.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.887
THEY'RE AT A CEMENT FACTORY
SOUTH OF LAKE SHORE,

30:57.920 --> 30:59.478
WEST OF LESLIE.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.215
THEY HAVE FOUND
A BLACK S.U.V.,

31:01.260 --> 31:04.229
LICENSE PLATE
A-Z-DOUBLE-A 707.

31:04.260 --> 31:05.955
IMMEDIATE BACKUP REQUESTED.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.890
(radio static)
(female dispatcher)
Copy, Williams.

31:07.930 --> 31:10.251
All available units, Code 1.
(radio static)

31:10.300 --> 31:14.236
(Bobby screaming and sobbing)

31:14.270 --> 31:16.932
(Bobby, muffled) AAH!
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!

31:16.970 --> 31:20.235
(Bobby shouting indistinctly)

31:20.270 --> 31:22.079
(indistinct shouting continues)

31:22.110 --> 31:25.273
(Bobby groaning and panting)

31:25.310 --> 31:28.177
AAH! (sobbing)

31:28.220 --> 31:30.074
GOD! I'M TELLING YOU,

31:30.120 --> 31:31.849
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
MORE TO TELL YOU!
(man) SHH, SHH...

31:31.890 --> 31:34.085
OKAY. MOVE YOUR CHANNEL
OVER TO T.A.C.
(man Speaking indistinctly)

31:34.120 --> 31:35.758
KEEP IT LOW.
(radio static, beep)

31:35.790 --> 31:36.984
(Bobby) SORRY.
(man) NO, IT'S JUST--

31:37.020 --> 31:39.386
OKAY.
(man) IT JUST MAKES ME CRAZY.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.126
IT'S SUCH A WASTE OF ENERGY.

31:42.930 --> 31:44.818
SO YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT THE DRUGS.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.497
YOU TOLD THEM ABOUT
THE MONEY LAUNDERING.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.066
YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT THE FIRES.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.328
LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.167
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.269
(Bobby panting)
BOBBY.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.005
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TESTIFY.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.270
SO JUST TELL ME
WHERE I'M AT HERE.

31:57.310 --> 31:59.346
'CAUSE MY LAWYERS ARE
GONNA NEED A LOT OF HELP.

31:59.380 --> 32:02.577
VINNIE, THIS FAMILY IS THE ONLY
THING THAT EVER MATTERED TO ME.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.919
THEN... WHY DID YOU SELL US OUT
TO SAVE YOUR OWN ASS?

32:05.950 --> 32:08.783
BECAUSE YOU WERE
KILLING PEOPLE.

32:08.820 --> 32:11.983
OKAY. TONY.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.759
YOU READY?

32:13.790 --> 32:15.997
YEAH. I GOTTA GET HOME.
LISA'S GONNA KILL ME.

32:16.030 --> 32:18.123
(gun clicks)
POLICE!

32:18.170 --> 32:21.264
DON'T MOVE!
SHE SAID DON'T MOVE!

32:21.300 --> 32:22.289
ON YOUR KNEES!

32:22.340 --> 32:24.900
PUT YOUR WEAPON DOWN NOW!

32:24.940 --> 32:26.168
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!
ON YOUR KNEES!

32:26.210 --> 32:27.905
(gun clatters on ground)
KICK IT OVER TO ME.

32:30.510 --> 32:31.772
(door closes)

32:34.120 --> 32:35.815
I KNOW
HOW YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.338
PARKING GARAGE,
CEMENT FACT ORY--

32:38.390 --> 32:40.119
VINNIE OWNS BOTH OF THEM,
SO IT MAKES SENSE

32:40.150 --> 32:42.653
HE WOULD TAKE HIM THERE.

32:42.690 --> 32:44.624
(inhales deeply)
LET'S ASSUME

32:44.660 --> 32:46.821
YOUR SISTER TOLD YOU
THE WHOLE THING,

32:46.860 --> 32:48.157
THE WHOLE PLAN.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.020
WHAT I DON'T GET

32:50.060 --> 32:52.324
IS WHY WOULD SHE BETRAY
HER HUSBAND LIKE THAT?

32:52.370 --> 32:54.964
VINNIE'S BEEN KNOCKING HER
AROUND SINCE THEY GOT ENGAGED.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.661
THAT GUY GOING TO JAIL
IS THE BEST THING

32:56.700 --> 32:58.008
THAT COULD EVER
HAPPEN TO HER.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.439
SHE'S NOT GONNA
TELL YOU THAT.

32:59.470 --> 33:01.734
SHE'S NOT GONNA TELL
ANYONE THAT--

33:01.780 --> 33:03.031
NOT EVEN ME.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.208
SHE CAN'T GET OUT.
CAN'T CALL THE COPS.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.616
CAN'T TESTIFY AGAINST HIM.
HE'D KILL HER.

33:09.980 --> 33:12.710
SO YOU DID IT
FOR YOUR SISTER?

33:12.750 --> 33:14.854
I TOLD YOU WHAT I SAW.

33:16.220 --> 33:17.949
I'M JUST GLAD IT HELPED.

33:25.930 --> 33:27.693
(door buzzes and beeps)

33:30.100 --> 33:31.965
SO. ..
(clears throat)

33:32.010 --> 33:33.568
THE PSYCHIC.
(scoffs)

33:33.610 --> 33:35.578
TALKED TO HIS SISTER.
MM-HMM.

33:35.610 --> 33:37.737
SHE CONFIRMED SHE HASN'T
SPOKEN TO HER BROTHER

33:37.780 --> 33:39.202
IN THREE YEARS.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.241
SHE SAYS SHE CUT TIES
WITH THE FAMILY

33:41.280 --> 33:42.918
WHEN SHE MARRIED VINNIE.

33:42.950 --> 33:44.440
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT?

33:44.490 --> 33:47.345
SHE CLAIMS VINNIE DOESN'T
TALK TO HER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS.

33:47.390 --> 33:49.654
AND YOU BELIEVE HER?
I DON'T KNOW.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.783
DID YOU ASK HER
IF HER BROTHER'S A PSYCHIC?

33:51.830 --> 33:53.354
OH, I ASKED HER.
AND?

33:53.390 --> 33:55.255
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T TELL ME.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.655
"ALWAYS WAS,
ALWAYS HAS BEEN."
(chuckles)

33:57.700 --> 33:59.327
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.133
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLAN
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.297
YOU KNOW, HUSBAND GOES
TO JAIL FOR LIFE.

34:03.340 --> 34:05.900
SHE'S HOME FREE,
AND SO'S DARIUS.

34:05.940 --> 34:07.407
NO ONE HAS TO TESTIFY.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.328
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU WANT
TO PUT A PSYCHIC ON THE STAND.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.803
I DON'T NEED TO.
I GOT BOBBY LOVE.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.875
(radio chatter)

34:13.910 --> 34:16.242
(telephone rings in distance)

34:18.720 --> 34:20.847
(sighs)

34:20.890 --> 34:23.051
UH...
(door closes)

34:23.090 --> 34:24.387
GOOD NEWS.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.727
WE FOUND OUR WITNESS.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.387
YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE
TO TESTIFY,

34:27.430 --> 34:29.022
BUT IT'S GONNA BE SHORT.

34:30.230 --> 34:33.063
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

34:33.100 --> 34:36.035
YEAH, MAYBE. OR MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT AS A SIGN.

34:36.070 --> 34:37.389
A LITTLE GIFT FROM GOD.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.533
GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

34:39.570 --> 34:42.300
START WORKING THE PROGRAM
AND STOP LYING TO PEOPLE.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.877
WHAT?
YOU SAID YOU'RE CLEAN,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.209
(laughs) SO...

34:48.250 --> 34:50.013
HERE COMES THE SPEECH, RIGHT?

34:50.050 --> 34:51.847
PUT MY FAITH
IN A HIGHER POWER,

34:51.890 --> 34:54.017
GIVE MYSELF UP
TO THE ILLUSION OF THE GROUP.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.484
SAVE YOUR BREATH, OFFICER.
I'M A SCIENTIST.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.887
FINE. THEN LOOK AT THE FACTS.
THEY DON'T LIE.

34:59.930 --> 35:01.295
SO YOU GONNA TELL ME
YOUR STORY NOW?

35:01.330 --> 35:02.820
YEAH, FINE.
I'LL KEEP IT SHORT.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.293
I CAN'T DO COKE
AND PLAY FOOTBALL.

35:04.330 --> 35:06.491
YEAH. SURE.

35:06.530 --> 35:08.794
OH, COME ON, MAN.
Y-YOU GOT THREE WEEKS,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.467
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE
UP ON THAT STAND.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.728
YOU GET CLEAN NOW,

35:11.770 --> 35:13.260
YOUR FAMILY MIGHT NOT
EVER EVEN HAVE TO KNOW.

35:13.310 --> 35:15.301
UH, THANK YOU.

35:15.340 --> 35:18.503
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.438
(door knob clicks)
JUST ONE MEETING.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.278
JUST--JUST ONE MEETING.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.811
YEAH, SURE. FINE.

35:25.850 --> 35:27.886
I PROMISE.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.059
THANK YOU, OFFICER.

35:30.090 --> 35:33.685
(door opens)

35:33.730 --> 35:35.891
YOU GOT THIS.
YOU GOT EVERY DETAIL,

35:35.930 --> 35:37.898
EVERY PROTOCOL
BURNED INTO YOUR BRAIN.

35:37.930 --> 35:41.434
NOW ALL YOU GOTTA DO...
IS TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.631
HMM. (Sighs) YEAH.
WELL, I'M TRYING...

35:43.670 --> 35:47.106
(chuckles) REALLY HARD.

35:49.210 --> 35:50.438
DOV... (Sighs)

35:50.480 --> 35:52.402
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:56.580 --> 35:58.013
OKAY.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.059
SUE, YOU'RE AMAZING.
(sighs)

36:03.090 --> 36:06.321
I MEAN, I-I-I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.452
I LOVE BEING AROUND YOU.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.526
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE FUNNY,

36:09.560 --> 36:10.720
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL--
EVERYTHING.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.899
EVERYTHING ABOUT US
IS--IS--IS A PERFECT FIT.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.830
99% OF THIS...
(scoffs)

36:15.540 --> 36:17.735
IS RIGHT. I JUST--

36:17.770 --> 36:21.433
(inhales) RIGHT NOW, UH...

36:21.480 --> 36:26.179
I'M--I'M JUST... STUCK,
AND...

36:26.210 --> 36:27.677
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

36:33.090 --> 36:36.355
YOU'RE STUCK? (inhales)

36:36.390 --> 36:37.516
YEAH.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.720
(sniffles)

36:38.760 --> 36:40.819
THAT'S, UM...

36:40.860 --> 36:43.158
(papers rustling)
A HELL OF A WAY
TO DESCRIBE IT.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.418
I MEAN, THAT'S A REALLY
TERRIBLE WAY...

36:45.470 --> 36:46.869
(papers clatter)
TO DESCRIBE IT.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.561
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.033
YOU'RE SORRY FOR WHAT?

36:50.070 --> 36:52.538
THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BEEN
LYING TO ME EVERY SINGLE DAY?

36:52.570 --> 36:55.004
OR THE--THE FACT THAT YOU
WERE PRETENDING TO CARE...
(slams down papers)

36:55.040 --> 36:57.838
ABOUT ME AND--AND US
AND THIS--
I WASN'T PRETENDING.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.348
(sighs) YOU WANT ME
TO HAVE FAITH? FINE.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.769
I DO. I HAVE FAITH--

37:02.820 --> 37:05.311
THAT I WILL FIND
SOMEONE ELSE WHO LOVES ME.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.758
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
OFFICER.

37:16.330 --> 37:17.820
(door buzzes and beeps)

37:17.860 --> 37:19.361
(indistinct conversations)

37:19.400 --> 37:22.062
SO THAT'S IT?
I'M FREE TO GO?

37:22.100 --> 37:23.431
(door closes)
FOR NOW.

37:23.470 --> 37:26.007
WE GOT YOUR NUMBER.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.531
THE LAWYERS MIGHT BE
IN TOUCH, BUT I THINK

37:28.580 --> 37:31.299
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA
KEEP YOU OUT OF IT.

37:32.980 --> 37:34.447
SO YOU GONNA
CALL YOUR SISTER?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.516
NO.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.177
WELL, MAYBE
SHE'LL CALL ME.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.609
AFTER THE TRIAL.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

37:40.650 --> 37:42.117
WHAT ABOUT ME?

37:42.160 --> 37:43.582
WELL, ABOUT GETTING
YOUR SISTER OUT HERE

37:43.620 --> 37:45.258
TO HELP YOU WITH THE BABY.

37:46.790 --> 37:49.793
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT DUE
FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS, SO...

37:49.830 --> 37:52.924
OH. WELL, STILL,
I'D GET ON IT.

37:52.970 --> 37:55.268
HMM. SHE'S GONNA BE CUTE,
BUT, UH,

37:55.300 --> 37:57.768
SHE'S GONNA BE
A HANDFUL.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.530
"SHE"? REALLY?

38:00.570 --> 38:02.902
(laughs)

38:02.940 --> 38:04.407
IT WAS LIKE SOME KIND
OF CRAZY--

38:04.450 --> 38:06.645
SIR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.114
(under breath)
I STILL THINK YOU'RE A FRAUD.

38:09.150 --> 38:10.469
WHAT?
WHAT?

38:10.520 --> 38:12.545
OH, NOTHING. IJUST, UH...

38:12.590 --> 38:14.239
I THINK YOU'RE A FRAUD.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.152
OKAY. HERE'S WHAT I THINK.

38:18.190 --> 38:21.057
YOU--YOU'RE NOT
GONNA MARRY THAT GUY.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.560
YOU--YOU'RE KINDA HARD TO READ,
BUT, UM,

38:24.600 --> 38:26.591
I SUGGEST YOU START
TELLING THE TRUTH FOR A CHANGE.

38:26.630 --> 38:28.666
OH, START TELLING THE TRUTH.
THAT IS RICH.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.736
AND YOU...
NEED TO TELL YOUR WIFE

38:30.770 --> 38:32.203
TO STOP SEEING THE OTHER GUY.

38:32.240 --> 38:36.802
GET YOURSELF BACK HOME.
THE KIDS MISS YOU.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.546
GOOD NIGHT, OFFICERS.

38:47.590 --> 38:49.808
(door opens and closes)

38:50.790 --> 38:52.781
GETTING READY TO MEET
THE PROSECUTORS?

38:52.830 --> 38:53.956
YEP.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.299
JERRY, I AM SORRY...

39:00.330 --> 39:02.161
ABOUT THE KNIFE.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.236
FINALLY TURNED IT OVER?

39:04.270 --> 39:06.306
I DID.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.466
AND?

39:08.440 --> 39:11.079
I'M OKAY WITH THINGS
THE WAY THEY ARE.

39:12.910 --> 39:16.539
I'M NOT JUST OKAY.
I'M GREAT. I'M HAPPY.

39:16.580 --> 39:17.842
I LOVE HOW IT IS.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.882
SO... S-SORRY.
THAT'S A "NO"?

39:19.920 --> 39:21.558
NO. I--

39:21.590 --> 39:22.955
NO, NO, IT'S NOT A "NO."

39:22.990 --> 39:27.654
IT'S JUST I NEVER REALLY
WANTED TO GET MARRIED--EVER.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.157
(clattering)

39:29.200 --> 39:30.827
YOU KNOW?
I DON'T LIKE THE STATS.

39:30.860 --> 39:34.125
FOUR OUT OF TEN MARRIAGES
END IN DIVORCE.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.968
YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T
LOVE THE VOWS--

39:37.000 --> 39:38.729
YOU KNOW, "LOVE, HONOR, OBEY."
I'VE NEVER--

39:38.770 --> 39:40.328
I'VE NEVER OBEYED ANYONE
IN MY LIFE.

39:40.370 --> 39:42.133
TRACI, YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED,

39:42.180 --> 39:44.478
WE DON'T HAVE TO
GET MARRIED.

39:44.510 --> 39:46.569
***

39:46.610 --> 39:49.170
HERE'S THE THING.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.688
ALL I DO ALL DAY
IS ANALYZE FACTS.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.517
I FOCUS ON THE PROOF

39:53.550 --> 39:55.654
AND I ASSUME THAT EVERYONE
I'M DEALING WITH IS LYING.

39:55.690 --> 40:00.320
YOU KNOW? BUT...
YOU AND ME?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.453
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.127
YEAH, YOU AND ME,
IT'S ABOUT--

40:04.160 --> 40:05.991
IT'S ABOUT WAKING UP
IN THE MORNING.

40:06.030 --> 40:08.066
YOU KNOW, I SEE YOU
CURLED UP NEXT TO ME,

40:08.100 --> 40:10.989
AND I THINK TO MYSELF,
"HOW DID I GET HERE?

40:11.040 --> 40:13.429
I MEAN, WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?"

40:13.470 --> 40:15.074
TRACE, I GET
THAT YOU'RE SCARED.

40:15.110 --> 40:19.171
I MEAN, WE--WE HAVE NO IDEA
IF THIS IS FOREVER.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.974
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU JUST GOTTA--

40:22.020 --> 40:23.874
YOU JUST GOTTA BELIEVE
IN THE UNBELIEVABLE.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.686
I-I GUESS--I GUESS I THINK
THAT'S THE POINT.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.350
***

40:32.860 --> 40:34.794
UM...

40:36.530 --> 40:37.827
SO...

40:37.860 --> 40:41.535
IN THE WORDS
OF MY FAVORITE BAND...

40:41.570 --> 40:42.889
(laughing)
UM...

40:42.940 --> 40:44.805
YOU'RE ABOUT TO QUOTE
COLDPLAY?

40:44.840 --> 40:47.434
NO, I--

40:47.470 --> 40:48.778
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU DON'T HAVE FAITH,

40:48.810 --> 40:51.005
'CAUSE I GOT ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.710
OKAY THEN.
(exhales and laughs)

40:54.750 --> 40:55.910
WHAT?

40:55.950 --> 40:57.508
LET'S DO IT.
LET'S GET MARRIED.

40:57.550 --> 40:58.949
YES? YOU'RE--YOU'RE
SAYING YES?

40:58.990 --> 40:59.979
YES.

41:00.020 --> 41:03.012
(man) * REMEMBER THE WAITIN' *

41:03.060 --> 41:07.326
* FOR OUR FIRST KISS *

41:07.360 --> 41:09.749
MMM!

41:09.800 --> 41:12.769
* SHIVERED AND TANGLED *
(tapping rhythmically)

41:12.800 --> 41:17.931
* AND NOTHING LIKE THIS *

41:17.970 --> 41:19.528
HEY, YOU COMING?

41:19.570 --> 41:21.162
(keys rattling)

41:21.210 --> 41:22.507
I HAVE YOUR EXTRA SET OF KEYS.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.303
SORRY. I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GIVE 'EM BACK.

41:24.340 --> 41:27.901
NO, I--YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HANG ON TO 'EM.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.841
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT GUY
SAID TO OLIVER IN THERE,

41:31.890 --> 41:33.517
BUT HE, UH...

41:33.550 --> 41:36.348
HE'S STORMING AROUND
LIKE SOMEBODY KICKED HIS DOG.

41:36.390 --> 41:39.257
I MEAN, I KNOW HE DOESN'T
HAVE A DOG, BUT, UH, YOU KNOW.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.429
I LOVE YOU.
WHAT?

41:41.460 --> 41:46.568
(laughs) I DO.
I LOVE YOU.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.068
THERE. I SAID IT.
IT'S OUT THERE.

41:49.100 --> 41:50.294
NOW I CAN STOP
WORRYING ABOUT IT

41:50.340 --> 41:51.637
COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH
AT A REALLY WEIRD TIME.

41:51.670 --> 41:53.706
YOU MEAN LIKE NOW?

41:53.740 --> 41:56.379
LOOK, YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY IT BACK.

41:56.410 --> 41:59.049
OKAY? I DON'T CARE THAT
YOU'VE NEVER SAID IT BEFORE,

41:59.080 --> 42:01.275
AND I DON'T CARE
IF YOU NEVER SAY IT.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.313
THIS IS HOW I FEEL,
AND... SO THERE.

42:04.350 --> 42:07.513
I'M SAYING IT.
(sighs)

42:07.550 --> 42:08.881
***

42:08.920 --> 42:10.148
WANT ME TO SAY IT AGAIN?

42:10.190 --> 42:11.418
START THE TRUCK.

42:11.460 --> 42:13.428
(laughs) 'CAUSE I WILL,
YOU KNOW?

42:13.460 --> 42:16.657
(starts engine)
I MEAN, NOW THAT I'VE
POPPED THE OLD CORK,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.588
LET THE GENIE OUT
OF THE BOTTLE,

42:18.630 --> 42:20.427
I MEAN, I'M GONNA
SAY IT ALL THE TIME.
MCNALLY, JUST DRIVE.

42:20.470 --> 42:22.290
