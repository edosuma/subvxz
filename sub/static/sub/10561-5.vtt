00:52.555 --> 00:55.182
- Come on. It's over here.
- This way?

00:55.183 --> 00:57.592
- All right.
- Let's go!

01:06.802 --> 01:08.769
The spot is just up there.

01:08.770 --> 01:10.771
Are you sure we'll be able to see?

01:10.772 --> 01:12.272
Everything.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.041
Ah!

01:14.042 --> 01:16.542
What happened?

01:28.521 --> 01:30.556
Ahhhhhh!

01:30.557 --> 01:32.758
- Dr. Grace.
- Good morning, Detective.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.328
- Lovely spot for it, at least.
- I understand the boys found

01:36.329 --> 01:39.164
- a human skull?
- Indeed they did.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.299
- Oh.
- The rest of the bones are

01:41.300 --> 01:43.068
scattered around the area.

01:43.069 --> 01:45.536
I should think animals
are the likely culprits,

01:45.537 --> 01:47.839
but until I clean and piece
the skeleton back together

01:47.840 --> 01:51.643
- I can't say for sure.
- Any preliminary thoughts?

01:51.644 --> 01:53.645
Given that the body was
unburied, and considering

01:53.646 --> 01:56.046
the warm, damp spring we've
had, this man could have died

01:56.047 --> 01:58.849
anywhere from a few
weeks to a few months ago.

01:58.850 --> 02:01.819
This man? You've determined
gender from the skull?

02:01.820 --> 02:03.720
Not quite.

02:05.523 --> 02:07.524
Not very feminine.

02:07.525 --> 02:10.828
- I see. Thank you, Doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.797
Boys.

02:14.798 --> 02:17.266
What were you doing in these woods?

02:17.267 --> 02:20.436
- Nothing.
- We were just playing.

02:20.437 --> 02:24.340
Gentlemen, I'm a detective
with the Toronto Constabulary.

02:24.341 --> 02:27.143
It's your duty to tell me the truth.

02:27.144 --> 02:29.270
- It was his idea.
- Tattletale!

02:29.271 --> 02:30.939
What was his idea?

02:30.940 --> 02:34.076
It's just, I never seen
a girl like that before,

02:34.077 --> 02:36.878
except my sister, but that doesn't count.

02:36.879 --> 02:38.679
A girl like what?

02:40.683 --> 02:42.417
Over there.

03:37.174 --> 03:39.407
You there. Yeah.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.476
Another Peeping Tom, are you?

03:41.477 --> 03:44.479
Sir. I must insist you
put on some clothing.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.682
- And I must insist that you leave.
- Detective Murdoch,

03:47.683 --> 03:49.183
Toronto Constabulary.

03:49.184 --> 03:51.919
You are trespassing on my private lands.

03:51.920 --> 03:56.156
I am the one who can eject you
for your judgmental morality.

03:56.157 --> 03:59.490
Fine. Does your property
extend beyond that ridge?

03:59.491 --> 04:03.130
- Yeah. All the way to the main road.
- Well, then, I regret to inform you

04:03.131 --> 04:05.331
that a human skeleton has
been found on your land.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.433
It will have nothing to do with us.

04:07.434 --> 04:09.435
That is a very definitive response.

04:09.436 --> 04:11.605
I purchased this land from the city,

04:11.606 --> 04:14.073
March of this year.
Obviously I would have noticed

04:14.074 --> 04:16.942
had there been a dead body
decomposing since this time.

04:16.944 --> 04:19.379
Now, if you will be leaving.

04:19.380 --> 04:23.281
Your comprehensive attire is
making our residents uncomfortable.

04:23.282 --> 04:26.051
Your residents?

04:26.052 --> 04:30.222
This is a sanctum for
those who wish to practice

04:30.223 --> 04:32.324
the Nacktkultur philosophy.

04:32.325 --> 04:35.160
Here we have managed to
achieve the ultimate goal:

04:35.161 --> 04:38.029
a self-contained community
where people can live together

04:38.030 --> 04:42.366
- in their natural form.
- But... why?

04:42.367 --> 04:47.204
It is so obvious, it's astounding that
humankind has ever lived in any other way.

04:47.205 --> 04:49.507
Clothing is, by its very nature,

04:49.508 --> 04:52.709
unhygienic, un-aesthetic,
and of course undemocratic.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.578
That's a very grand statement.

04:54.579 --> 04:58.015
All life on earth comes from the sun,

04:58.016 --> 05:00.450
but we cut ourselves off
from this with these layers

05:00.451 --> 05:02.853
- of clothing.
- Hello.

05:02.854 --> 05:06.590
Come join me for a swim in the
river. You'll never want to leave.

05:06.591 --> 05:09.992
This man is a detective, Hanna.

05:09.993 --> 05:11.994
He is not here to be enlightened.

05:11.995 --> 05:15.030
Oh. Such a shame.

05:18.869 --> 05:22.838
Does your philosophy condone open
relationships between the sexes?

05:22.839 --> 05:25.006
Not in the way that you think.

05:25.007 --> 05:28.977
Men and women live together in
understanding and acceptance.

05:28.978 --> 05:32.647
The body is not forbidden
when it is unclothed.

05:32.648 --> 05:35.684
In our natural state,
all perversions dissipate.

05:35.685 --> 05:38.286
- It is utopia.
- Helmut.

05:38.287 --> 05:41.521
You didn't tell me we had a
new member. My apologies, sir,

05:41.522 --> 05:43.724
- for not meeting you sooner.
- Detective

05:43.725 --> 05:47.728
Murdoch. Meine Frau,
Irene. She will see you out.

05:47.729 --> 05:51.364
- Of course. I'll just need to put
something on first. - Of course.

05:51.365 --> 05:54.602
We must make concessions when
dealing with the outside world.

05:54.603 --> 05:56.669
Arthur.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.805
Callisthenics in 10 minutes.

05:58.806 --> 06:01.674
- Not today.
- If he doesn't start

06:01.675 --> 06:05.377
participating, I will have no choice
but to ask him to leave. Helmut,

06:05.378 --> 06:08.648
we decided to allow people
to adapt at their own pace.

06:08.649 --> 06:10.917
That was part of the problem
in Germany, wasn't it?

06:10.918 --> 06:12.985
- Enforced ideals?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:12.986 --> 06:17.455
Detective, we are a peaceful people
with no interest in harming anyone.

06:17.456 --> 06:20.291
We simply want to be left alone.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.727
Guten Morgen.

06:30.135 --> 06:32.136
A skeleton on our property?

06:32.137 --> 06:33.771
How horrible.

06:33.772 --> 06:36.206
Your husband didn't seem
particularly concerned.

06:36.207 --> 06:39.076
Helmut is not one to show his emotions,

06:39.077 --> 06:42.813
and, as you can imagine, he is
somewhat suspicious of outsiders.

06:42.814 --> 06:44.848
How many people live here?

06:44.849 --> 06:48.051
At present we're about 20,
but we've had many come and go.

06:48.052 --> 06:50.887
- Has anyone ever gone missing?
- Not to my knowledge.

06:50.888 --> 06:55.158
But we don't monitor our
members. We're a free society.

06:55.159 --> 06:57.627
I'd like to see your records.

06:57.628 --> 07:01.130
We're not a school or a
hotel; we don't keep records.

07:01.131 --> 07:04.733
Then I require a list of everyone
who has ever stayed here before.

07:04.734 --> 07:08.270
You surely can't believe one of us
is responsible for that poor soul.

07:08.271 --> 07:09.938
Read this.

07:09.939 --> 07:12.640
It should quell any further
suspicions you may have.

07:22.617 --> 07:25.787
George, the Paris Revue
is coming here to Toronto.

07:25.788 --> 07:28.122
I don't speak French, Henry.

07:28.123 --> 07:29.857
Look at this.

07:29.858 --> 07:32.292
They lift their skirts, George.

07:32.293 --> 07:33.794
Above their knees.

07:33.795 --> 07:35.628
Bare legs?

07:35.629 --> 07:37.430
How many women, exactly?

07:37.431 --> 07:40.801
I'll get us the tickets.
Do you have some money?

07:40.802 --> 07:42.635
Henry, I mustn't.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.204
I have a lady friend.

07:44.205 --> 07:46.907
I need to protect my
reputation as a gentleman.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.710
- Crabtree.
- Sir.

07:50.711 --> 07:52.945
- I'm out of scotch...
- Already, sir?

07:52.946 --> 07:56.949
She is a demanding mistress,
son. Oh, bloody hell!

08:00.921 --> 08:02.722
I am here to see

08:02.723 --> 08:06.457
Thomas S. Brackenreid,
and I demand an audience.

08:06.458 --> 08:10.128
Can I help you, miss?

08:10.129 --> 08:12.197
Jean Hamilton.

08:12.198 --> 08:15.100
I must speak with the
inspector on an urgent matter.

08:15.101 --> 08:17.068
But he is conveniently not in.

08:17.069 --> 08:18.870
Again.

08:18.871 --> 08:21.304
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

08:21.305 --> 08:23.540
I shall only deal with the inspector.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.818
Close call.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.953
Sir, why not simply tell Miss Hamilton

08:36.953 --> 08:39.020
that you're otherwise occupied?

08:39.022 --> 08:42.323
Well, then she would tell Margaret,
and that bench would become my bed.

08:42.325 --> 08:45.694
You'll get it when you're married,
Murdoch. So, what's this I hear

08:45.695 --> 08:47.797
about a bunch of people running
around with no clothes on?

08:47.798 --> 08:49.698
Ah, yes.

08:52.802 --> 08:55.403
- You saw them, did you?
- Yes.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.572
In the flesh?

08:57.573 --> 08:59.741
Mm.

08:59.742 --> 09:01.877
So, what do we know about the dead man?

09:01.878 --> 09:04.079
Not much, I'm afraid. We
were unable to determine

09:04.080 --> 09:07.648
who he was or how he
died with any precision.

09:09.417 --> 09:12.219
- Some money.
- So not a robbery.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.454
Newspaper articles.

09:14.455 --> 09:17.291
Am I interrupting?

09:17.292 --> 09:19.293
- Julia!
- Ah, Dr. Ogden.

09:19.294 --> 09:22.529
Enlighten me. Why would
any sane person want

09:22.530 --> 09:24.746
to strip down and run around
while completely sober?

09:24.747 --> 09:25.698
Are you referring

09:25.699 --> 09:27.667
to the naturist colony
in the Don Valley woods?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.969
- You know of it?
- One of their members,

09:29.970 --> 09:33.239
- Hanna Rice, was a patient of mine.
- Ah. That explains it.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.208
Of my former medical practice.

09:35.209 --> 09:38.178
She made it sound quite compelling.

09:38.179 --> 09:40.979
I admit a certain curiosity
to try it for myself.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.949
- Julia.
- Is that their manifesto?

09:43.950 --> 09:47.419
"In nudity there is
equality among the classes."

09:47.420 --> 09:49.554
Well, they're a naÃ¯ve bunch.

09:49.555 --> 09:53.225
Naturism is based on the philosophies
of the German pundit Heinrich Pudor.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.993
The idea is to connect
to nature in the hopes

09:55.994 --> 09:58.296
of finding health and social equality.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.331
Nudity, exercise,

10:00.332 --> 10:02.900
and vegetarianism are the
main tenets, I believe.

10:02.901 --> 10:05.269
"It's as important to remove foreign bodies

10:05.270 --> 10:08.372
in the form of meat, alcohol,
and tobacco from inside the body

10:08.373 --> 10:12.008
as it is to remove artificial
coverings from the outside."

10:12.009 --> 10:14.211
Bloody hell, that's no life.

10:14.212 --> 10:16.813
Vegetarianism has been
around for centuries.

10:16.814 --> 10:19.850
Such a diet can be quite
beneficial. And rather tasty.

10:19.851 --> 10:22.485
If you say so, Doctor.

10:24.255 --> 10:28.023
William, I only have a
moment. Would you walk me out?

10:28.024 --> 10:30.492
Yes, of course.

10:30.493 --> 10:32.928
William, I've spoken with Darcy.

10:32.929 --> 10:34.897
He has consented to the divorce.

10:34.898 --> 10:38.533
So, he's prepared to weather the scandal?

10:38.534 --> 10:41.871
He wants to resolve this as much as we do.

10:41.872 --> 10:45.639
So, how do we proceed?

10:45.640 --> 10:47.942
Darcy is the only one
with grounds to petition,

10:47.943 --> 10:50.711
so we must provide him with
whatever he needs to proceed.

10:50.712 --> 10:54.148
But, Julia, we aren't guilty of adultery.

10:54.149 --> 10:56.784
Yes, but we must prove that we are,

10:56.785 --> 10:59.120
or the petition will be denied.

10:59.121 --> 11:03.123
Right. What sort of proof is required?

11:03.124 --> 11:06.159
I'm meeting with my solicitor
this morning to discuss

11:06.160 --> 11:08.228
- the finer points.
- Julia...

11:08.229 --> 11:10.230
William, we will get through this.

11:10.231 --> 11:12.899
Now I really must go.

11:21.308 --> 11:23.309
That's the last of him.

11:23.310 --> 11:25.511
We don't have his right arm entirely.

11:25.512 --> 11:27.813
Only from the elbow.

11:27.814 --> 11:30.116
Honestly, we're lucky
to have found this much.

11:30.117 --> 11:32.183
Oh, look, George,

11:32.184 --> 11:35.186
there appears to be a
nick in his third costal.

11:35.187 --> 11:38.256
Oh, yes. I think you're right.

11:38.257 --> 11:41.126
"Costal" is Latin for "rib", George.

11:41.127 --> 11:43.361
Over here. Oh, his costal. Yes.

11:43.362 --> 11:47.265
Ah, Detective. I was just

11:47.266 --> 11:49.666
helping Dr. Grace piece
together our victim here.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.536
Many hands make light work and all of that.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.771
That's very kind of you, George.

11:54.772 --> 11:56.941
Dr. Grace?

11:56.942 --> 11:59.977
Our subject is male,
approximately 40 years old;

11:59.978 --> 12:02.446
cause of death seems fairly clear:

12:02.447 --> 12:04.613
this man was shot through the heart.

12:04.614 --> 12:06.416
The bullet entered here

12:06.417 --> 12:08.952
and lodged in the scapula here.

12:08.953 --> 12:10.686
I see. And the bullet?

12:10.687 --> 12:14.123
It must have fallen out of
the body during decomposition.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.459
The bullet is still
likely at our crime scene.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.894
The remains were scattered
over a fairly large area.

12:18.895 --> 12:20.562
The bones of the torso were

12:20.563 --> 12:23.198
found by the water's edge, if that helps.

12:23.199 --> 12:27.235
Still, it will take considerable
time to find an item so small.

12:27.236 --> 12:29.804
Not if we use the
induction balancing machine.

12:29.805 --> 12:31.673
Oh, really, sir?

12:31.674 --> 12:33.975
Yes.

12:40.449 --> 12:43.617
- Where are you off to?
- Oh, sir, I'm to meet the detective.

12:43.618 --> 12:45.152
Give it to me, Crabtree.

12:45.153 --> 12:47.188
I could do with spending a
little more time in the field.

12:47.189 --> 12:49.190
Oh, sir, you won't want
to with this one, trust me.

12:49.191 --> 12:51.725
I said give it to me! I
can manage a little romp

12:51.726 --> 12:54.260
in the woods. See if you can
manage things around here,

12:54.261 --> 12:57.964
starting with that concerned citizen.

12:57.965 --> 13:01.033
- I have something horrible to report.
- But, sir...

13:02.903 --> 13:05.271
Sir, you must keep up your pedalling

13:05.272 --> 13:07.307
to maintain the electrical current.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.320
Bloody hell, Murdoch. We've
been at this for hours.

13:10.321 --> 13:12.589
It's been seven minutes.

13:12.590 --> 13:16.026
Seven minutes?

13:16.027 --> 13:18.495
Does this contraption even work?

13:18.496 --> 13:19.996
Yes, sir.

13:19.997 --> 13:22.566
The electrical current
creates a magnetic field

13:22.567 --> 13:26.169
that can only be interrupted by
the presence of metal in the soil.

13:26.170 --> 13:29.605
I need to take a break.

13:29.606 --> 13:33.041
No, no, sir, don't,
please! Please don't stop.

13:35.279 --> 13:38.314
I think I've found something.

13:45.688 --> 13:47.922
Not the bullet, exactly.

13:50.110 --> 13:54.346
It is probable that this prosthetic
arm did belong to our victim.

13:54.347 --> 13:57.216
- What can you tell us about it, Doctor?
- I confess

13:57.217 --> 13:59.218
I am not an authority.

14:00.987 --> 14:04.622
Remarkable! Where
exactly did you find this?

14:04.623 --> 14:07.725
- In the mud. Is that important?
- Gentlemen, I can't promise

14:07.726 --> 14:11.229
this will yield us a clue,
but this arm is a rare treat

14:11.230 --> 14:14.966
indeed. A textbook example of adipocere.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.534
Queen's English, please, Dr. Grace.

14:17.535 --> 14:20.470
It means, Inspector, that the
victim's flesh has been preserved.

14:20.471 --> 14:22.539
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:22.540 --> 14:25.242
I have a lot of work to do.

14:25.243 --> 14:27.611
It is simply immoral.

14:27.612 --> 14:29.847
The goings on at the music
hall are barely acceptable

14:29.848 --> 14:32.081
on the best of nights, but this,

14:32.082 --> 14:34.550
- it's outrageous.
- Miss Hamilton,

14:34.551 --> 14:36.752
I see your point, and
it's an excellent point,

14:36.753 --> 14:39.823
but I cannot stop the Paris
Revue from coming to Toronto,

14:39.824 --> 14:42.325
nor can I stop people from going to see it.

14:42.326 --> 14:45.829
- Might I remind you that it is your duty...
- Yes, well, there are two

14:45.830 --> 14:48.563
prosthetic manufacturers
in Toronto. One uses wood

14:48.564 --> 14:51.133
exclusively, and the other
I have yet to conta...

14:51.134 --> 14:53.268
How can we expect to
raise our children decently

14:53.269 --> 14:56.872
- when our streets are filled with licentiousness?
- Miss Hamilton...

14:56.873 --> 15:00.675
Look at this poster. It
shows a woman's bare legs!

15:00.676 --> 15:04.178
- It's unacceptable.
- It is just a drawing.

15:04.179 --> 15:06.380
It is a public affront,

15:06.381 --> 15:08.715
and it must be dealt with.

15:11.586 --> 15:13.820
Immediately!

15:20.595 --> 15:23.163
Thank you for seeing us, Dr. Rico.

15:23.164 --> 15:25.466
Do you recognize this?

15:25.467 --> 15:27.468
But of course.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.671
This is one of my finest.

15:30.672 --> 15:34.074
You know, I'm the only one in North America

15:34.075 --> 15:37.477
to use the revolutionary Vanghetti Method,

15:37.478 --> 15:40.813
taught to me by Giuliano Vanghetti himself.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.915
I've only heard of this in theory.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.918
Dr. Vanghetti devised a
way to use the contractions

15:45.919 --> 15:48.087
of the surviving musculature of the limb

15:48.088 --> 15:50.757
to enable manipulation of the prosthetic.

15:50.758 --> 15:52.957
Very impressive, señora,

15:52.958 --> 15:54.726
and quite correct.

15:54.727 --> 15:59.865
Do you know who ordered
this particular limb?

15:59.866 --> 16:02.000
I can tell you in a moment.

16:02.001 --> 16:04.636
Each limb is carefully calibrated

16:04.637 --> 16:07.005
to its new owner.

16:07.006 --> 16:09.607
I see. Uno momento.

16:13.144 --> 16:18.048
Imagine, a manmade limb that
moves almost like the original.

16:18.049 --> 16:20.818
Thank you so much for inviting me along.

16:20.819 --> 16:24.121
- I thought you might be interested.
- How well you know me.

16:24.122 --> 16:28.324
Si, I remember this gentleman.

16:28.325 --> 16:32.896
He was American. I fitted
him for the arm on March 3rd,

16:32.897 --> 16:36.766
- and he picked it up April 14.
- April 14th. - Yeah.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.835
Did he give you a name or an address?

16:38.836 --> 16:42.337
Zachariah Marsh, care of the Palace Hotel.

16:42.338 --> 16:44.940
We now know Zachariah Marsh was murdered

16:44.941 --> 16:46.942
some time after April 14th,

16:46.943 --> 16:50.211
long after the naturists
had moved onto the property.

16:50.212 --> 16:53.849
But even that date doesn't help
narrow our list of suspects.

16:53.850 --> 16:56.717
Given that the naturists have
created a place of refuge,

16:56.718 --> 17:00.020
perhaps the killer sought out
the community as a place to hide.

17:00.021 --> 17:02.423
You think the killer
might still be among them?

17:02.424 --> 17:04.692
It's certainly a
possibility. He may believe

17:04.693 --> 17:07.594
that leaving now would be
more suspicious than staying.

17:09.330 --> 17:12.366
William, I met with my solicitor.

17:12.367 --> 17:15.233
The requirements are rather
more involved than I had hoped.

17:15.234 --> 17:18.371
The evidence, you mean?

17:18.372 --> 17:21.273
We need hotel ledgers, witnesses,

17:21.275 --> 17:23.676
correspondence detailing the adultery,

17:23.678 --> 17:27.380
details that must be published in
the national newspaper for six months.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.082
- Julia, how on earth do we...
- Not we.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.218
I alone am assuming full
responsibility for the divorce.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.153
What do you mean?

17:35.154 --> 17:39.391
I will weather the embarrassment of
it. I'll make all the arrangements.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.722
I chose to marry Darcy alone.

17:40.723 --> 17:42.862
I must make it right alone.
You're to stay out of it.

17:42.863 --> 17:44.396
Julia...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.731
I have given this a lot of thought.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.970
It's unfair to burden you.
I... I won't besmirch your name

17:51.971 --> 17:54.338
or put your career at risk.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.508
You have to name a co-respondent.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.977
And I shall, but not you.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.011
William, I am quite determined.

18:01.012 --> 18:02.946
Yes, completely cover the legs.

18:02.947 --> 18:06.349
- Constable Crabtree.
- Ah, Doctor. Detective.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.184
George, what are you doing?

18:08.185 --> 18:10.186
- I am...
- He's upholding his oath

18:10.187 --> 18:12.188
as an enforcer of the righteousness

18:12.189 --> 18:14.992
- of this fine city.
- As I can see.

18:14.993 --> 18:18.895
George, I need your assistance
on an urgent police matter.

18:18.896 --> 18:21.531
- I apologize, Miss Hamilton.
- Nonsense, Constable.

18:21.532 --> 18:24.600
Tonight we will deal with
a nightclub on Yonge Street.

18:24.601 --> 18:27.670
It's blaring some vulgar
music called "ragtime".

18:27.671 --> 18:30.505
It sounds like pure sin.

18:34.443 --> 18:37.378
Ugh. Thank you, sir.

18:37.379 --> 18:38.880
Not a worry, George.

18:38.881 --> 18:41.082
I need you to go to the Palace Hotel

18:41.083 --> 18:43.117
and see if they have kept
any of this man's effects.

18:43.118 --> 18:46.387
Zachariah Marsh. Sir.

18:50.825 --> 18:54.394
Ah. Inspector, you must take a look.

18:57.866 --> 19:00.668
Do you see that? The cells have burst.

19:00.669 --> 19:03.336
I suppose that's significant?

19:03.337 --> 19:06.806
It means the dermis was exposed
to extremely low temperatures.

19:06.807 --> 19:08.307
He was frozen?

19:08.308 --> 19:10.843
But not solid; only up
to the intermediate layer

19:10.844 --> 19:13.312
of skin. He was exposed to
below-freezing temperatures,

19:13.313 --> 19:15.048
but only for a short while.

19:15.049 --> 19:17.050
Frozen, outdoors,

19:17.051 --> 19:18.918
but only for a short while.

19:18.919 --> 19:21.219
I think I know where to look next.

19:24.323 --> 19:26.124
Well, come on, then.

19:30.930 --> 19:35.033
Murdoch, Dr. Grace has found
us a piece of the puzzle.

19:35.034 --> 19:37.268
My examination

19:37.269 --> 19:40.271
of the preserved tissue showed that
the cells had been frozen post-mortem,

19:40.272 --> 19:42.273
but because only the dermis
showed signs of freezing...

19:42.274 --> 19:44.342
That's just the middle layer of skin...

19:44.343 --> 19:46.711
the logical conclusion is
that a rapid and brief drop

19:46.712 --> 19:48.713
in temperature caused the damage.

19:48.714 --> 19:51.216
The Meteorological Society
has given us this chart

19:51.217 --> 19:53.251
of recorded temperatures for the past year.

19:53.252 --> 19:56.253
Do any days match the
criteria after April 14th?

19:56.254 --> 20:00.524
Only one: April the 15th starting at 2am.

20:00.525 --> 20:03.995
It only lasted for a few hours, and the
temperature hasn't dipped again since.

20:03.996 --> 20:08.232
So Zachariah Marsh received
his prosthetic arm on April 14th

20:08.233 --> 20:10.667
and then died later that same night.

20:10.668 --> 20:14.704
Poor bugger. A brand new arm
and barely a day to enjoy it.

20:14.705 --> 20:16.773
Mr. Lindemann.

20:16.774 --> 20:18.775
Detective. Back again.

20:18.776 --> 20:21.311
What now? A corpse in our chimney?

20:23.147 --> 20:26.314
I wonder, do you recognize
the name Zachariah Marsh?

20:26.315 --> 20:28.083
I do not.

20:28.084 --> 20:31.686
I'll need a list of everyone
that was here on April 14th.

20:31.687 --> 20:34.088
I will not expose our
members to your tyranny.

20:34.089 --> 20:39.093
I thank you to cease this blatant
harassment of our community. No more.

20:43.498 --> 20:45.232
Oh,

20:45.233 --> 20:48.769
hello. Did you change your mind
about joining our little gang?

20:48.770 --> 20:52.639
Uh, not at the moment, thank you.

20:52.640 --> 20:56.943
I believe we may have a friend
in common... Dr. Julia Ogden.

20:56.944 --> 20:59.379
Such a kind spirit.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.214
You must send my regards.

21:01.215 --> 21:03.616
She deserves infinite love and joy.

21:03.617 --> 21:05.985
Miss Rice,

21:05.986 --> 21:09.121
do you recall where you were on April 14th?

21:09.122 --> 21:12.124
How could I forget?

21:12.125 --> 21:16.495
That was my first day here. We
were like pioneers, the five of us.

21:16.496 --> 21:19.764
It was so beautiful. I've
never felt such peace.

21:19.765 --> 21:21.833
- The five of you?
- Yes.

21:21.834 --> 21:25.336
Helmut, Irene, Declan, and
Arthur. And me, of course.

21:25.337 --> 21:28.173
- No one else was here?
- No,

21:28.174 --> 21:29.741
not a soul.

21:29.742 --> 21:31.742
Thank you.

21:40.085 --> 21:42.686
What do we think? The German?

21:42.687 --> 21:45.856
Without knowing Zachariah
Marsh's connection to any of them,

21:45.857 --> 21:49.026
I'm afraid we don't
have much to go on. Sirs.

21:49.027 --> 21:51.628
Ah, George. Do you have
Mr. Marsh's effects?

21:51.629 --> 21:54.818
I do. You're not going to believe
what I found out about him.

21:56.366 --> 21:58.868
- He was a Pinkerton.
- What?

21:58.869 --> 22:01.003
Not just any Pinkerton.
Zachariah Marsh was the man

22:01.004 --> 22:04.373
who took down the infamous
Rooster gang. Texas, 1889.

22:04.374 --> 22:07.376
He single-handedly killed
them all in a wild shootout.

22:07.377 --> 22:09.477
But he didn't survive unscathed.

22:09.478 --> 22:11.947
A stray bullet took his right arm.

22:11.948 --> 22:14.315
- So he was a Pinkerton and a Wild West legend?
- Yes, sir.

22:14.316 --> 22:16.284
You see, the Rooster gang
were a notorious family

22:16.285 --> 22:18.353
of thieves, a gang of four brothers.

22:18.354 --> 22:22.157
They were the scourge of the West.
They would steal a man's money, and then

22:22.158 --> 22:26.160
take his boots to prevent him giving
chase. It's ingenious, if you ask me.

22:26.161 --> 22:29.596
- How do you know all this, Crabtree?
- Through my research, sir.

22:29.597 --> 22:32.599
I was tinkering with the idea of
setting a novel in the Wild West.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.702
Our hero would be a young
deductive type, about my height...

22:35.703 --> 22:38.072
Do we know what Mr. Marsh
was working on before he died?

22:38.073 --> 22:41.107
Yes, sir. He was tracking
a confidence trickster,

22:41.108 --> 22:43.109
a fellow by the name of Sherman Greene,

22:43.110 --> 22:45.678
wanted for insurance fraud in Boston.

22:45.679 --> 22:49.249
Perhaps he tracked this con
to the naturist encampment.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.517
Marsh must have been
discovered by this Greene fellow

22:51.518 --> 22:55.155
and then killed to keep
his secret identity safe.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.856
Well, we know Marsh was
on the trail of a man...

22:57.857 --> 22:59.691
So that leaves us

22:59.692 --> 23:02.094
with three possible suspects.
What do we know about them?

23:02.095 --> 23:04.129
Aside from their names, sir, nothing.

23:04.130 --> 23:06.765
- What about the Pinkerton case?
- Well, sir,

23:06.766 --> 23:09.802
Marsh tracked Sherman Greene
from Boston to Montreal.

23:09.803 --> 23:12.904
And he's also been linked to
fraud cases in Philadelphia,

23:12.905 --> 23:16.573
New Orleans, Chicago...
all in the past year.

23:16.574 --> 23:19.210
- But no mention of Toronto.
- Greene's been known

23:19.211 --> 23:21.645
to use several aliases,
and has been heard speaking

23:21.646 --> 23:24.115
- in various accents.
- So that could be anyone.

23:24.116 --> 23:26.250
Let's start with Lindemann. Bring him in.

23:26.251 --> 23:28.919
Sir, these people don't trust outsiders.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.054
They're not going to talk to me.

23:31.055 --> 23:33.589
They're even less likely to speak to you.

23:33.590 --> 23:36.226
What we need is someone on the inside.

23:36.227 --> 23:39.295
Someone they haven't seen before.

24:02.802 --> 24:06.738
All right, George. It's
just like taking a bath,

24:06.739 --> 24:09.307
but... without water.

24:09.308 --> 24:10.808
Hello.

24:10.809 --> 24:13.478
- Hello!
- I'm Irene, Helmut's wife.

24:13.479 --> 24:16.648
Uh, Henry. Henry Higgins.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

24:16.649 --> 24:19.151
And please relax. We're all
equal here in God's image.

24:19.152 --> 24:21.386
We have a full schedule of tasks

24:21.387 --> 24:23.987
and exercise and hope
you'll participate fully.

24:23.988 --> 24:26.090
Here we're all committed to the same goals:

24:26.091 --> 24:27.658
health and vitality.

24:27.659 --> 24:30.327
Yes, because I work as a
footman in a grand house,

24:30.328 --> 24:33.188
you see. I rarely get out of doors.

24:33.189 --> 24:34.365
- Uh, I was born out...
- We leave

24:34.366 --> 24:37.168
our restrictive pasts behind
with our restrictive clothing.

24:37.169 --> 24:39.835
This is your chance to
be born as your true self.

24:39.836 --> 24:41.837
You owe no explanations.

24:41.838 --> 24:44.974
You know what? That sounds perfect.

25:13.602 --> 25:15.869
"... onto".

25:15.870 --> 25:18.539
Toronto Gazette.

25:18.540 --> 25:22.477
You can set up your tent here. And the
daily schedule is posted by the main tent.

25:22.478 --> 25:25.379
I'd very much like to meet your
husband there, Mr. Lindemann.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.547
Helmut is about to begin
our water callisthenics.

25:27.548 --> 25:29.549
He'll be happy to meet you later.

25:29.550 --> 25:31.651
How did the two of you meet,
if you don't mind me asking?

25:31.652 --> 25:35.288
He was speaking outside Union Station
about his vision for this place.

25:35.289 --> 25:38.458
I just knew everything he was saying
was right. He was so passionate.

25:38.459 --> 25:41.894
- We were married within the fortnight.
- Is that right?

25:41.895 --> 25:45.097
- And what part of Germany is he from?
- We don't speak of our pasts.

25:45.098 --> 25:47.899
We're happy together now.
That's all that matters.

25:47.900 --> 25:51.069
I suppose this would be a good
place to hide one's secrets.

25:51.070 --> 25:53.395
This is a good place to
become one's best self.

25:53.396 --> 25:56.198
Take Declan... he arrived

25:56.199 --> 25:58.600
drunk, weary, riddled
with infirmity, in search

25:58.601 --> 26:01.168
of a safe haven. Look at him now.

26:01.169 --> 26:04.004
We could be your safe haven too.

26:07.776 --> 26:10.878
I've sent Jackson to dig up
the sale of the naturists' land.

26:10.879 --> 26:13.114
I don't trust that Lindemann fellow.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.814
So, what's all this, then?

26:14.815 --> 26:17.817
Sir, ink from the newspaper
article has transferred

26:17.818 --> 26:20.153
to the inside of Mr. Marsh's wallet.

26:20.154 --> 26:22.389
Now, it's too faint to see
against the dark leather.

26:22.390 --> 26:24.391
I'm hoping to lift the ink.

26:24.392 --> 26:27.127
I've mixed an elastic
polymer in with the wax.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.629
An elastic what?

26:28.630 --> 26:32.331
Polymer. In this case, the
element of rubber allows

26:32.332 --> 26:35.701
the wax to stretch.

26:35.702 --> 26:38.571
The ink should transfer to the wax,

26:38.572 --> 26:40.740
and the presence of the
polymer will allow the wax

26:40.741 --> 26:43.942
to be pliable enough to
peel off without crumbling.

26:43.943 --> 26:46.611
Hmm. Could I take some of this putty home

26:46.612 --> 26:49.147
for the boys, Murdoch? It's
just the kind of silliness...

26:49.148 --> 26:51.683
Sir, please. It isn't a toy.

26:57.423 --> 26:59.591
Hello there.

26:59.592 --> 27:03.026
Eins, zwei, drei...

27:03.027 --> 27:05.061
You're new here, are you?

27:05.062 --> 27:07.464
FÃ¼nf, sechs...

27:09.367 --> 27:11.934
It takes a bit of getting used to,

27:11.935 --> 27:14.504
but it beats the world
out there, that's for sure.

27:14.505 --> 27:20.276
Personally, I'm trying to get
away from the evils of drink.

27:20.277 --> 27:23.579
Whiskey. It ruined me.
It was my whole life.

27:23.580 --> 27:26.048
I used to drink it out of a
teacup so no one would notice.

27:26.049 --> 27:28.750
I was a bourbon man myself.

27:28.751 --> 27:30.719
For me, it was the travelling, you know?

27:30.720 --> 27:34.189
A long night on a train without
a drink... I couldn't abide it.

27:34.190 --> 27:37.693
I wouldn't know anything about that.

27:37.694 --> 27:41.530
This is about as far out of the
city as I think I've ever been.

27:41.531 --> 27:43.731
Is that right?

27:50.339 --> 27:52.039
Aha.

27:56.077 --> 27:59.679
Henry, I need you to go
to the Toronto Gazette.

27:59.680 --> 28:04.250
I need you to get every article that
has the words "daring" and "stole" in it,

28:04.251 --> 28:06.886
starting from March.

28:10.791 --> 28:13.192
Yes, sir.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.765
Bracing, isn't it?

28:19.766 --> 28:23.034
There is nothing like a
swim to restore the body.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.671
It certainly beats
travelling the dusty roads.

28:25.672 --> 28:27.773
I never leave the colony.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.808
The outside world is corrupt, an oligarchy

28:30.809 --> 28:33.244
of rich industrialists.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.413
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.816
The insurance lot are
the worst of the devils.

28:38.817 --> 28:42.253
I think they should be swindled out of the
money they plunder from innocent people.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.689
Crime does not effect change.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.923
It only serves to alienate us Volks...

28:46.924 --> 28:48.759
people... even more.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.761
You're German?

28:50.762 --> 28:53.453
I am from mankind.

28:53.454 --> 28:57.723
Quite so. Have you seen
much of North America?

28:57.724 --> 29:02.094
Boston? Chicago? Philadelphia? New Orleans?

29:02.095 --> 29:05.664
Do not ask what you have no right to know.

29:09.502 --> 29:12.737
Make sure Worseley reads this, this time.

29:20.011 --> 29:21.612
Inspector.

29:21.613 --> 29:24.181
How unusual to see you here.

29:24.182 --> 29:26.617
Miss Hamilton. I wish I could say the same.

29:26.618 --> 29:29.620
I trust you know there were boys
playing ball in High Park last Sunday?

29:29.621 --> 29:32.456
Explicitly breaking the
law for everyone to see.

29:32.457 --> 29:34.024
I was not aware.

29:34.025 --> 29:36.125
Where is Constable Crabtree?

29:36.126 --> 29:38.294
I intend to deal only with him.

29:38.295 --> 29:42.031
I'm afraid he is engaged in
police business off the premises.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.234
How disappointing. He
is the only reliable man

29:45.235 --> 29:47.470
- in this stationhouse.
- Inspector,

29:47.471 --> 29:51.172
- you have a telephone call.
- Ah. Now, if you'll excuse me,

29:51.173 --> 29:54.442
Miss Hamilton. Duty calls.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.448
Hm!

30:07.589 --> 30:09.123
Oh! I apologize...

30:09.124 --> 30:12.359
- Dr. Ogden!
- George!

30:12.360 --> 30:15.195
What are you doing here?

30:15.196 --> 30:17.632
The same as you, I imagine.

30:17.633 --> 30:21.068
I must say I'm impressed by
your open-mindedness, Constable.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.804
You seem to be embracing the
spirit of the colony completely.

30:24.805 --> 30:26.406
Dr. Ogden, I am working!

30:26.407 --> 30:28.575
We're trying to uncover a murderer.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.411
I must insist that you leave at once.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.547
It's not safe. And if
Detective Murdoch knew

30:33.548 --> 30:37.216
that you were here... knew that I saw...

30:37.217 --> 30:39.585
Yes, perhaps we'll keep
this just between us.

30:39.586 --> 30:42.688
And I won't compromise your
investigation. You have my word.

30:42.689 --> 30:45.624
Thank you.

30:45.625 --> 30:48.060
I've been... swimming in the cold river.

30:48.061 --> 30:51.130
Oh...

30:57.703 --> 31:00.204
The Pinkerton Agency just telephoned.

31:00.205 --> 31:02.924
Sherman Greene, the insurance
conman, was caught in Boston.

31:02.925 --> 31:04.042
He never came to Toronto.

31:04.043 --> 31:06.744
Then what was Marsh doing in Toronto?

31:06.745 --> 31:09.714
- And what led him to the naturist camp?
- Change of lifestyle?

31:09.715 --> 31:12.415
Henry, have you found the article yet?

31:12.416 --> 31:16.519
Not yet sir. There's three editions a day.

31:16.520 --> 31:20.857
Right. The newspaper article from Mr.
Marsh's wallet is our only remaining clue.

31:20.858 --> 31:23.961
Right, everyone, drop what you're doing
and help Higgins find this article.

31:23.962 --> 31:25.929
Carry on.

31:31.868 --> 31:34.403
Hello there. I'm Henry.

31:34.404 --> 31:36.338
I don't believe I got your name.

31:36.339 --> 31:38.274
I didn't give it.

31:40.477 --> 31:42.478
It's beautiful here.

31:42.479 --> 31:46.214
I prefer it to Chicago or Boston.

31:52.989 --> 31:54.789
Don't mind him.

31:54.790 --> 31:56.825
He's so unfriendly.

31:56.826 --> 31:59.727
He even prefers to live alone

31:59.728 --> 32:01.729
in an unpleasant cave across the river.

32:01.730 --> 32:03.998
Why did he come here in the first place?

32:03.999 --> 32:07.267
Everyone here has a reason to
reject the outside world as it is.

32:07.268 --> 32:10.537
I try to be friendly, but
he just wants to be alone.

32:10.538 --> 32:14.307
You don't know where he's from, do you?

32:14.308 --> 32:17.276
Um, I think somewhere west of here.

32:27.488 --> 32:30.256
Sirs, I've found it!

32:34.127 --> 32:37.163
"A daring daylight
robbery occurred yesterday

32:37.164 --> 32:40.132
at the Hay and Sons
Pharmacy on St. Clair Avenue.

32:40.133 --> 32:41.833
The thief not only took

32:41.834 --> 32:44.570
the contents of the safe but
also stole Mr. Hay's boots.

32:44.571 --> 32:47.039
Mr. Hay told police he
was unable to give chase

32:47.040 --> 32:48.966
due to his stocking feet."

32:48.967 --> 32:51.393
His boots? Where have I heard that before?

32:51.394 --> 32:53.428
- From George.
- Yes!

32:53.429 --> 32:56.964
Zachariah Marsh supposedly
killed all of the Rooster gang.

32:56.965 --> 32:59.134
This article would suggest otherwise.

32:59.135 --> 33:02.770
So Crabtree is going
up against a gunslinger.

33:02.771 --> 33:05.004
So it would appear.

33:10.752 --> 33:14.222
Sir. Uh, I apologize for the attire, sir.

33:14.223 --> 33:16.690
- It's the best I could do.
- It's all right, George.

33:16.691 --> 33:19.059
Sir, my investigation
has come to a standstill.

33:19.060 --> 33:21.094
Not one of the suspects
appears to be Sherman Greene.

33:21.095 --> 33:23.997
- That's because none of them is, George.
- Sir?

33:23.998 --> 33:26.099
Sherman Greene was arrested in Boston.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.535
Mr. Marsh was here for another reason...

33:28.536 --> 33:31.171
- to finish off the Rooster gang.
- The Rooster gang?

33:31.172 --> 33:33.239
You think one of them survived and is here?

33:33.240 --> 33:34.773
Apparently so, George.

33:34.774 --> 33:37.276
Obviously it isn't Mr. Lindemann.

33:37.277 --> 33:38.553
Well, it isn't Declan Black either.

33:38.554 --> 33:40.395
Apparently he's never
left Toronto in his life.

33:40.847 --> 33:42.815
That just leaves Arthur Gibbons.

33:42.816 --> 33:45.751
Yes, sir, it must be Gibbons.

33:45.752 --> 33:47.352
Apparently he's from out west.

33:47.353 --> 33:50.422
And he's very secretive. He's
definitely hiding something.

33:50.423 --> 33:54.125
- All right. We'll bring him in for questioning.
- Sir,

33:54.126 --> 33:56.928
as you yourself have said, these
people are not likely to talk,

33:56.929 --> 33:58.996
and we haven't a shred of evidence.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.965
I'm sure I could find something, but...

34:00.966 --> 34:04.401
only if I remain one of them.

34:04.402 --> 34:07.571
- Sir, let me do this.
- Are you sure?

34:13.377 --> 34:15.878
George?

34:44.938 --> 34:47.706
- What are you doing in here?
- I was just...

34:47.706 --> 34:49.326
I don't know where you came
from, but here we respect

34:49.327 --> 34:51.030
each other's privacy. I'm
going to have to tell Helmut.

34:51.031 --> 34:52.717
No. Please.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.349
I have no choice. You
obviously can't be trusted.

34:55.350 --> 34:58.851
I promise, it's not what it looks
like. Just let me explain. Irene,

34:58.852 --> 35:02.889
I'm a copper. I've been sent here
covertly to look for a criminal.

35:02.890 --> 35:06.192
Is this about the
skeleton the police found?

35:06.193 --> 35:09.663
You can't say anything to
anyone. Not even to Helmut.

35:09.664 --> 35:13.166
If Gibbons is the man we think
he is, he's very dangerous.

35:13.167 --> 35:15.334
But he's such a quiet sort.

35:15.335 --> 35:19.404
Apparently Arthur was a
member of a gang of outlaws.

35:21.207 --> 35:24.109
Well... now that you mention it...

35:24.110 --> 35:26.144
What?

35:26.145 --> 35:28.347
If you know something, you have to tell me.

35:28.348 --> 35:31.916
I did see Arthur burying something
in the clearing behind the cave.

35:33.619 --> 35:35.620
Irene, I need you to get to the main road.

35:35.621 --> 35:38.122
I need you to get a
message to Detective Murdoch

35:38.123 --> 35:40.725
at Stationhouse #4. Tell
him to come here at once.

35:40.726 --> 35:42.527
Of course.

35:57.608 --> 35:59.609
What do you think you're doing?

35:59.610 --> 36:01.911
Arthur Gibbons.

36:01.912 --> 36:06.181
I am with the Toronto Constabulary. Just...

36:06.182 --> 36:08.351
just come with me quietly,

36:08.352 --> 36:10.786
and it will go all the better for you.

36:10.787 --> 36:13.556
I'm not going anywhere.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.626
Ugh!

36:28.237 --> 36:30.471
He was going to kill you.

36:32.975 --> 36:35.008
Ok, thanks.

36:35.009 --> 36:37.911
Henry? Any information on Arthur Gibbons?

36:37.912 --> 36:39.888
I just have, sir. He's from Vancouver.

36:39.889 --> 36:41.482
He enlisted in the army
to fight in the Boer War,

36:41.483 --> 36:43.517
but he's missing from his regiment.

36:43.518 --> 36:46.553
He's just a cowardly deserter.
He's not a gunslinger.

36:46.554 --> 36:49.456
So if the outlaw isn't Helmut
Lindemann, Declan Black,

36:49.457 --> 36:52.758
or Arthur Gibbons, then who is it?

36:55.195 --> 36:58.431
Thank you for saving me.

36:58.432 --> 37:00.733
You're quite the shot.

37:00.734 --> 37:03.069
My brothers taught me.

37:09.141 --> 37:11.610
That's quite the scar you've got there.

37:11.611 --> 37:14.946
Uh, it's a... childhood injury.

37:18.117 --> 37:21.453
Jackson found the land sale receipt.

37:21.454 --> 37:24.822
So Lindemann didn't buy
the land; his wife did,

37:24.823 --> 37:27.391
only she purchased it
under her maiden name.

37:27.392 --> 37:29.293
Irene Le Coq.

37:29.294 --> 37:31.862
Where did she get the money?

37:31.863 --> 37:34.765
Henry, do we have anything on
Irene Lindemann's background?

37:34.766 --> 37:36.400
No, sir.

37:36.401 --> 37:39.469
- Le Coq. French.
- Yes, sir.

37:39.470 --> 37:42.071
French for "rooster".

37:54.617 --> 37:56.318
George.

37:56.319 --> 37:58.987
Where did you say you grew up, Irene?

37:58.988 --> 38:01.623
Uh... here and there.

38:01.624 --> 38:03.291
With brothers, you said.

38:03.292 --> 38:05.894
Moving from town to town?

38:05.895 --> 38:08.130
Something like that.

38:10.532 --> 38:13.133
- You killed a man!
- Arthur was going to kill you!

38:13.134 --> 38:15.770
You killed him to close the case
so we wouldn't come looking for you!

38:15.771 --> 38:18.506
But you've killed before, haven't you?

38:18.507 --> 38:20.708
- Zachariah Marsh!
- Who?

38:20.709 --> 38:23.544
The Pinkerton agent! He killed
your family in front of your eyes,

38:23.545 --> 38:26.146
left you with that
nasty scar as a souvenir.

38:26.147 --> 38:28.682
That snake only cared about the fame.

38:28.683 --> 38:30.450
He took everything from me.

38:30.451 --> 38:34.120
I had nothing to live for after that day.

38:34.121 --> 38:36.122
Until I met Helmut.

38:36.123 --> 38:37.924
He gave me a fresh start.

38:37.925 --> 38:40.326
You were stealing just a few months ago.

38:40.327 --> 38:43.428
Only to buy Helmut this land.
I just needed another $50.

38:43.429 --> 38:44.997
It was the only way.

38:44.998 --> 38:47.466
That's how Marsh found you, isn't it?

38:47.467 --> 38:49.902
He read about it in the
paper. The stolen boots.

38:49.903 --> 38:52.505
Old habits.

38:52.506 --> 38:54.272
But...

38:54.273 --> 38:56.809
I'm not that person.

38:56.810 --> 38:58.810
I'm not a thief anymore.

38:58.811 --> 39:02.180
No. You're a murderer.

39:03.983 --> 39:06.283
I can't let you ruin everything,

39:06.284 --> 39:09.387
not after all I've done to stay.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.555
Aw!

39:17.629 --> 39:21.798
I wish I didn't have to do
this. But I won't lose my life.

39:21.799 --> 39:24.167
Not again.

39:24.168 --> 39:26.970
Ugh! Aw!

39:26.971 --> 39:29.540
George, are you all right?

39:29.541 --> 39:32.374
- Sirs?
- Crabtree?

39:32.375 --> 39:35.945
- William.
- Julia?

39:46.169 --> 39:48.803
You look a disgrace,
Crabtree. Fix your uniform.

39:48.804 --> 39:50.872
Sir, this collar is so tight.

39:50.873 --> 39:54.276
And, sir, you wouldn't
believe... the warmth of the sun,

39:54.277 --> 39:58.380
the cool breeze on your skin...
you can't imagine how freeing it is.

39:58.381 --> 40:01.983
I saw enough to imagine it all too well.

40:05.020 --> 40:08.322
- George.
- Hanna.

40:08.323 --> 40:12.026
I'm sorry your wife
refused to speak with you.

40:12.027 --> 40:14.428
I had hoped for an explanation.

40:14.429 --> 40:18.365
I can't imagine that she was
not sincere in her beliefs.

40:18.366 --> 40:21.034
It seems she wanted a new life,

40:21.035 --> 40:23.436
and you were able to give that to her.

40:23.437 --> 40:27.474
Yeah. It was a paradise. Our own Xanadu.

40:27.475 --> 40:29.442
I understand you'll be leaving us?

40:29.443 --> 40:31.378
The purity of our community

40:31.379 --> 40:33.813
has been tarnished. Only Hanna wished

40:33.814 --> 40:37.149
to stay on the path with
me. We are going south,

40:37.150 --> 40:39.986
somewhere where we can
be free all year long,

40:39.987 --> 40:41.787
without restrictions.

40:41.788 --> 40:44.089
I hope you find such a place.

40:44.090 --> 40:47.326
Thank you, Detective. Viel GlÃ¼ck.

40:47.327 --> 40:49.227
Good luck.

40:52.698 --> 40:55.000
You know, Hanna, I almost
didn't recognize you

40:55.001 --> 40:57.502
- with clothes on.
- To tell the truth,

40:57.503 --> 40:59.445
I can hardly keep myself from
ripping them off right here.

40:59.446 --> 41:00.991
I couldn't bring myself

41:00.992 --> 41:03.474
- to put on my underclothes.
- Me neither.

41:03.475 --> 41:06.477
Heathens! Reprobates!

41:06.478 --> 41:08.579
Miscreants! Degenerates!

41:08.580 --> 41:12.148
This city is doomed with
moral guardians like you!

41:14.785 --> 41:19.088
- What was that all about?
- I think I'm not the man she wanted me to be.

41:21.592 --> 41:24.027
It was good to know you, George.

41:24.028 --> 41:25.795
Take care of your health.

41:25.796 --> 41:27.529
You too.

41:29.866 --> 41:31.533
Miss Rice.

41:43.480 --> 41:45.346
William.

41:47.083 --> 41:48.817
I'm sorry I'm late.

41:48.818 --> 41:51.653
I trust you've forgiven me for earlier.

41:51.654 --> 41:55.924
Julia, I've reserved a room
for us at the Queen's Hotel.

41:55.925 --> 41:59.660
- William.
- Under both our names.

41:59.661 --> 42:01.862
We'll both sign the ledger.

42:01.863 --> 42:05.700
William, I can't ask you to be
involved in such a sordid task.

42:05.701 --> 42:07.702
Julia, I am involved.

42:07.703 --> 42:10.204
There is no question. We both are.

42:10.205 --> 42:13.908
In this and in everything.

42:15.676 --> 42:17.677
The Queen's Hotel.

42:17.678 --> 42:20.580
- Everyone will see us.
- Witnesses,

42:20.581 --> 42:24.550
a signed ledger... that should
be all the evidence you need.

42:24.551 --> 42:27.954
Are you quite sure you want to do this?

42:27.955 --> 42:30.690
You know there will be no going back.

42:30.691 --> 42:33.158
I'm sure.

42:33.159 --> 42:37.562
So, you're prepared to
spend the night together.

42:41.467 --> 42:43.902
I've brought dominoes.
