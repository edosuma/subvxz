Previously on Rectify.

00:07.446 --> 00:08.916
Aren't you a romantic?

00:08.917 --> 00:12.757
I make $7-$8,5 an hour
in the 21st century.

00:12.758 --> 00:16.020
It's not romantic. It's real.

00:16.021 --> 00:18.941
- I'm sorry. I'm really really sorry.
- For what?

00:18.942 --> 00:20.173
For hurting your brother.

00:20.174 --> 00:23.652
Thank you, Tawney, for
reaching out to me when you did.

00:23.653 --> 00:25.863
I hope I did the right thing, Daniel.

00:25.864 --> 00:30.219
If I find out you're with her, I'll
press charges. I swear to God.

00:30.220 --> 00:32.220
We got to be our brother's keeper.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.221
That's how places like this work.

00:34.222 --> 00:36.019
We just need you to be one of us.

00:36.020 --> 00:38.660
I may just not be up to the task.

00:41.252 --> 00:44.273
My client was originally
convicted 20 years ago

00:44.274 --> 00:46.274
on what I believe was
a coerced confession.

00:46.275 --> 00:49.483
That is not right, Sondra.
That will never be right.

AMANTHA: You ready?

01:07.937 --> 01:08.839
Yes.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.510
What have you been doing?

01:12.944 --> 01:14.143
Just thinking.

01:14.845 --> 01:16.380
About?

01:17.447 --> 01:18.742
Who else?

01:19.249 --> 01:20.518
Teddy?

01:21.286 --> 01:22.447
Your big brother.

01:24.679 --> 01:28.286
How he was before all that's
happened... happened.

01:29.665 --> 01:31.067
And how was he?

01:32.750 --> 01:34.356
He was complicated.

01:35.572 --> 01:37.305
So we know he wasn't adopted.

01:37.787 --> 01:39.821
(CHUCKLES) No.

01:40.741 --> 01:42.777
And he certainly wasn't untroubled,

01:42.778 --> 01:44.216
even as a child.

01:45.213 --> 01:50.906
But he was always curious and bright.

01:52.287 --> 01:54.187
I thought he might be a writer.

01:54.188 --> 01:55.789
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:55.790 --> 01:57.651
He still is bright, Mother,

01:58.292 --> 02:00.928
and curious, and alive.

02:00.929 --> 02:02.128
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

02:02.129 --> 02:03.666
Don't forget that part.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.302
He is still alive in the here and now.

02:07.018 --> 02:09.347
And he can still be a writer,

02:09.348 --> 02:11.318
or whatever else he wants to be.

02:11.319 --> 02:12.942
So, we don't have to think about

02:12.943 --> 02:14.241
what was or what could have been,

02:14.242 --> 02:18.279
because today, this day,
it can now be what it is.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.150
Today, we're gonna be
a family again, Mama.

02:25.352 --> 02:27.789
God, why can't you be
happy for one moment?

02:29.958 --> 02:31.758
It's not so simple, honey.

02:31.759 --> 02:33.762
For one moment, it is.

02:34.196 --> 02:38.199
Your firstborn is gonna be back
in that house in a few hours,

02:38.200 --> 02:39.814
and he can walk out that door

02:39.815 --> 02:41.368
and stand right here in this back yard

02:41.369 --> 02:42.737
if he so chooses.

02:42.738 --> 02:44.505
He's like Lazarus, Mother.

02:44.506 --> 02:46.907
Daniel has risen from the dead.

02:46.908 --> 02:49.778
So you can afford for one
friggin' moment to be happy.

02:52.179 --> 02:53.414
Okay, honey.

03:08.386 --> 03:09.965
AMANTHA: Mom?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.061
Hey, honey.

03:14.401 --> 03:16.504
Jon's gonna be here in a few minutes.

03:17.425 --> 03:18.441
Great.

03:19.508 --> 03:21.276
Do you want to do it in the living room?

03:22.091 --> 03:23.946
Sounds fine.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.982
What have you been doing?

03:28.049 --> 03:29.718
I'm sorry, Amantha.

03:30.217 --> 03:31.712
For what?

03:33.155 --> 03:35.123
For abandoning you.

03:38.103 --> 03:39.572
No, Mother.

03:39.936 --> 03:42.363
I shouldn't have said
what I said in the attic.

03:42.364 --> 03:44.465
I got stirred up seeing Bobby Dean,

03:44.466 --> 03:46.034
and had a brief relapse.

03:47.468 --> 03:49.238
I've always been so ashamed.

03:50.038 --> 03:51.440
Ashamed of what?

03:52.907 --> 03:55.209
For letting everyone down...

03:55.210 --> 03:59.625
your brother, your father, you.

04:01.448 --> 04:03.483
You were depressed, Mom.

04:03.484 --> 04:06.321
You were probably clinically depressed.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.776
We just didn't know it at the time.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.059
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

04:12.060 --> 04:13.829
I knew it.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.521
I just couldn't deal with reality.

04:18.966 --> 04:23.537
I was so angry, I just... went to bed.

04:23.538 --> 04:25.474
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

04:26.012 --> 04:28.538
Dad tried to deal with that reality.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.513
Look what happened to him.

04:32.229 --> 04:34.483
So it was left to you.

04:37.085 --> 04:38.084
I was a kid.

04:38.085 --> 04:39.407
(CHUCKLES)

04:40.426 --> 04:44.059
Kids are (CHUCKLES) less breakable.

04:44.975 --> 04:47.443
And Daniel was my brother, not my son.

04:48.261 --> 04:53.065
He was part brother,
part ideal...(CHUCKLES)

04:53.435 --> 04:55.314
part fantasy, really.

04:56.270 --> 04:59.273
Maybe that's why I was able to fight
for him for as long as I did,

04:59.274 --> 05:03.149
because I believed that
if we got him out,

05:04.545 --> 05:06.836
we could live happily ever after.

05:09.150 --> 05:10.602
I know you did.

05:12.644 --> 05:15.456
I just want you to live
your life, Amantha,

05:15.457 --> 05:17.291
the way you want to.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.659
Well, I'm gonna try, Mom,

05:19.660 --> 05:23.663
but it may not be what
you wanted for me.

05:23.664 --> 05:25.266
I just wanted you to get out of here.

05:25.267 --> 05:27.500
- That's all.
- That's not all.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.303
You wanted me to get out of here

05:29.304 --> 05:31.340
because you wanted to get out of here.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.198
I hear you, honey.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.332
Do you?

05:36.977 --> 05:39.012
Because you will always be disappointed

05:39.013 --> 05:40.514
if you try to live through me.

05:40.515 --> 05:44.499
And I will be a disappointment to you.

05:47.354 --> 05:50.092
Have you and Daniel been
talking to each other?

05:50.744 --> 05:51.696
No.

05:52.092 --> 05:53.578
Why?

05:53.579 --> 05:56.060
Is that what you feel
when you're around me?

05:56.793 --> 05:58.699
My disappointment in you.

05:58.700 --> 06:03.807
Mm, not always, but... sometimes.

06:04.371 --> 06:06.040
Well, that shouldn't be.

06:06.041 --> 06:08.377
Because you're my hero, young lady.

06:11.578 --> 06:13.480
God, Mom.

06:13.481 --> 06:15.050
What?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.126
Well, first of all...

06:19.809 --> 06:21.343
I'm not that young.

06:22.489 --> 06:24.592
It's all relative, honey.

06:26.227 --> 06:29.164
Excuse me while I go powder my nose.

might come back after work

07:54.482 --> 07:56.750

08:36.532 --> 08:38.604
We're giving you another raise.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.159

08:40.159 --> 08:44.665

In what way?

08:58.621 --> 09:00.215
As a boss.

09:01.788 --> 09:04.770
I hadn't really thought
about it, to be honest.

09:06.277 --> 09:07.723
Interesting.

09:09.123 --> 09:10.014

09:53.168 --> 09:55.637
I'll be. It's really happening.

09:56.837 --> 09:58.573
It really is.

09:59.573 --> 10:01.876

longer than I have.

Damn, I didn't realize
it was that old, Carl.

How's the leg?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.516

10:10.517 --> 10:11.851
still a little hitch in my giddy-up,

10:11.852 --> 10:13.386
but I'm on the mend.

10:13.387 --> 10:16.389
Yeah, well, I talked to the D.A.

10:16.390 --> 10:18.192
She's willing to knock the charges

10:18.193 --> 10:19.461
down to misdemeanors.

10:20.661 --> 10:21.961
That's good news.

10:21.962 --> 10:24.530
- There's a catch.
- All right.

10:24.531 --> 10:26.500
You gotta take an anger
management class,

a firearm safety course,

10:27.935 --> 10:29.837
and attend 30 A.A. meetings.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.242
Well, I'm on the wagon
right now, anyway,

10:36.243 --> 10:39.180
so I'll take my medicine with thanks.

10:42.784 --> 10:45.486
You know, I could probably
use a new set of tires.

10:54.228 --> 10:55.631
You ever know Lester Holden, Carl?

10:57.631 --> 11:00.433
A little bit. Why?

11:00.434 --> 11:01.518
I don't know.

11:01.969 --> 11:05.057
I'm selling the store, been
thinking about him some.

11:05.396 --> 11:06.340
Finding some of his old files

11:06.341 --> 11:08.234
with his handwriting on 'em or whatever.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.415
He was... loquacious,

11:16.416 --> 11:17.551
I guess you'd say.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.686
But from everything I ever heard,

11:19.687 --> 11:21.789
he was good people.

11:25.693 --> 11:28.761
Did you and Daniel ever come
to some kind of something

11:28.762 --> 11:30.429
before he left?

11:30.430 --> 11:32.966
(SIGHS) Not really.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.900
Why?

11:34.901 --> 11:37.149
I don't know.

11:38.972 --> 11:41.138
You just think about things...

11:42.943 --> 11:45.175
usually right before daylight.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.750
I know about thinking about things.

11:50.952 --> 11:53.288
It's just damn unfortunate.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.415
I heard that.

11:59.827 --> 12:02.361
Yep, I just might bring
the family car by

12:02.362 --> 12:03.931
and get me a set of tires.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.536
Well, you better hurry up.
Tomorrow's the last day.

12:08.035 --> 12:09.602

12:09.603 --> 12:11.322

12:11.838 --> 12:13.348
It does.

12:15.629 --> 12:17.226
You go easy, now.

12:20.515 --> 12:22.251
You still think he did it, Carl?

12:26.688 --> 12:27.922
Like you used to?

12:32.327 --> 12:33.592
(SIGHS)

12:33.593 --> 12:37.465
Between me and you and these tires...

12:39.126 --> 12:40.528
Not really.

12:41.568 --> 12:43.737
I feel pretty sure he didn't do it.

12:44.306 --> 12:47.376
But then, I felt pretty sure before.

12:48.009 --> 12:49.147
What's the difference?

12:51.044 --> 12:54.049
There were a lot of things
that weren't known back then,

12:54.638 --> 12:56.004
or looked into.

12:57.165 --> 12:58.766
And a lot of mistakes.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.785
And no one ever even spoke
to Chris Nelms that day?

13:16.786 --> 13:18.255
Never did.

13:19.823 --> 13:21.725
Unbelievable.

13:22.892 --> 13:24.793
I never liked Roger Nelms.

13:24.794 --> 13:27.064
Even in school, he was a prick.

13:28.364 --> 13:29.931
Well, he was.

13:29.932 --> 13:33.591
Anyway, Sheriff Daggett and Ms. Person

13:33.592 --> 13:34.660
both feel, ultimately,

13:34.661 --> 13:37.095
there was likely nothing
premeditated or malicious

13:37.096 --> 13:39.098
that occurred during the
original investigation.

13:39.099 --> 13:39.998
Just...

13:39.999 --> 13:43.167
Prejudice, arrogance,
inanity, what else?

13:44.361 --> 13:45.970
And I'm still not convinced

13:45.971 --> 13:48.542
about the "nothing premeditated
or malicious" part.

13:48.972 --> 13:51.553
Forgive me for still being
suspicious of asses.

13:52.077 --> 13:53.845
And did you witness

13:53.846 --> 13:56.148
the former sheriff's
interview yourself, Jon?

13:56.588 --> 13:58.651
They shared C.J.'s deposition with me,

13:58.652 --> 14:02.268
which I believe is a good sign
of their true intentions.

14:02.269 --> 14:03.657
What did you think?

14:04.657 --> 14:07.225
At the least, the Paulie
Sheriff's Department

14:07.226 --> 14:09.434
made serious, critical mistakes.

14:10.763 --> 14:12.864
I think early on, they...

14:12.865 --> 14:14.032
certainly led by Roland Foulkes...

14:14.033 --> 14:16.901
had made their minds up about
Daniel being the killer,

14:17.637 --> 14:19.607
and then they set out to prove it.

14:21.907 --> 14:24.642
That's not unique in
wrongful conviction cases.

14:24.643 --> 14:26.679
In fact, it's more the
rule than the exception.

14:27.482 --> 14:28.916
Well, that's comforting.

14:29.713 --> 14:32.050
How many things could it be, really?

14:32.051 --> 14:34.308
That's not so surprising.

14:35.721 --> 14:38.190
But to hear the details of that day,

14:38.191 --> 14:40.993
what they actually did and didn't do...

14:40.994 --> 14:43.094
(SCOFFS)

14:43.095 --> 14:45.633
is somehow even more tragic.

14:49.134 --> 14:53.941
So, what happens now, Mr. Stern?

14:54.911 --> 14:57.343
I am going to drive up to
speak with Daniel personally

14:57.344 --> 14:59.347
about what has transpired,

15:00.134 --> 15:01.280
and what to expect

15:01.281 --> 15:03.382
if the Georgia Bureau of Investigation

15:03.383 --> 15:05.751
accepts Ms. Person's formal request

15:05.752 --> 15:06.987
to open a new inquiry.

15:07.543 --> 15:08.788
Inquiry of what?

15:10.476 --> 15:11.831
Of everything.

15:18.369 --> 15:20.839
Thank you, Jon, for not giving up.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.791
We're a long way from
what we want, Janet,

15:25.444 --> 15:28.153
but this is a remarkable turn.

15:29.587 --> 15:31.983
And I'm glad you're getting
to see Daniel, too.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.319
As am I.

15:35.215 --> 15:38.090
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

16:13.190 --> 16:14.292
PEYTON: Hello?

16:20.165 --> 16:21.534
Hello, Peyton.

16:26.204 --> 16:27.506
She hates goodbyes.

16:31.508 --> 16:33.812
I kind of figured.

16:36.882 --> 16:39.050
She wanted you to have this, though.

16:41.085 --> 16:44.054
She said "it might look
good in the fun house,"

16:44.055 --> 16:46.222
direct quote.

16:46.223 --> 16:47.511
Yes, uh...

16:48.926 --> 16:50.277
it just might.

16:51.041 --> 16:54.065
Oh, and the book.

16:55.695 --> 16:58.432
She said give her a call
after you've read it.

17:01.795 --> 17:02.928
(CHUCKLES)

17:02.929 --> 17:05.195
Sure.

17:05.196 --> 17:08.290
Well, I'm gonna go back downstairs.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.838
Stay as long as you like, Daniel.

17:13.252 --> 17:19.992
Who will, uh, live here
now in this big box?

17:21.314 --> 17:23.214
Well...

17:23.214 --> 17:25.621
Me, actually.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.119
I was up next.

17:28.121 --> 17:29.323
Good.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.123
Good for you.

17:31.576 --> 17:33.727
Yeah, I'm fortunate.

17:34.706 --> 17:36.262
It's a nice space.

17:39.587 --> 17:41.100
The windows.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.304
Sorry?

17:45.225 --> 17:47.675
I'm always struck by the windows here.

17:51.176 --> 17:52.813
They are striking.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.150
And I'm always reminded.

17:58.718 --> 18:00.120
Reminded?

18:02.122 --> 18:04.792
Of a box with no windows.

18:06.392 --> 18:08.759
You're welcome to come visit.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.781
You're a kind man.

18:16.668 --> 18:17.649
Thank you.

18:49.035 --> 18:50.370
Nice day, isn't it?

18:50.878 --> 18:51.964
It is.

18:53.722 --> 18:55.533
I notice those more now.

18:56.241 --> 18:57.710
That's good.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.212
I hope you can enjoy a nice day

19:01.213 --> 19:03.149
once in a while too now, Jon.

19:05.151 --> 19:06.353
Maybe.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.232
Did you really quit Justice Row?

19:10.615 --> 19:11.463
I did.

19:12.099 --> 19:13.738
But they would probably take me back.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.270
Nonprofits can't be choosy.

19:16.667 --> 19:19.608
Oh, they would take you back.

19:19.978 --> 19:21.515
They're not idiots.

19:23.144 --> 19:26.480
And... maybe take some time off

19:26.481 --> 19:29.785
before you definitively decide
to become a tax lawyer.

19:30.793 --> 19:33.355
I'll take that under
advisement, counselor.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.382
Because you're one of
the good guys, Jon,

19:37.149 --> 19:39.592
and you're fighting on the
side of the righteous.

19:39.593 --> 19:44.431
And, God, what a terrible
loss that would be

19:44.432 --> 19:46.468
for the good guys.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.332
When you put it like that...

19:54.102 --> 19:55.044
What?

19:55.735 --> 19:58.757
How many ledges did you talk
me off of over the years?

20:00.180 --> 20:02.250
- A few.
- (LAUGHING) Yeah.

20:04.452 --> 20:06.486
I had an epiphany.

20:06.487 --> 20:07.788
I think that's what it was.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.523
Oh, yeah?

20:10.524 --> 20:12.844
Smoking a joint in a satellite dish.

20:14.762 --> 20:16.597
I could see those going together.

20:16.598 --> 20:18.834
- All three, actually.
- (LAUGHS)

20:19.766 --> 20:23.403
Doesn't matter what
happens at this point.

20:23.404 --> 20:26.807
I mean, it matters.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.644
Of course it matters.

20:30.477 --> 20:34.915
But nothing will rectify
what's happened.

20:34.916 --> 20:39.785
It won't bring back Hanna or my dad

20:39.786 --> 20:42.123
or my 18-year-old brother.

20:45.592 --> 20:49.230
I think that might actually
qualify as an epiphany.

20:50.798 --> 20:52.468
Or really good pot.

20:54.636 --> 20:56.472
God...

21:08.683 --> 21:10.519
Safe travels, sir.

21:14.321 --> 21:16.356
And hug my brother for me, will you?

21:16.357 --> 21:17.758
I'll do it.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.294
Okay.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.332
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

21:28.936 --> 21:30.606
See you around sometime.

21:32.307 --> 21:33.775
See you around.

21:37.411 --> 21:38.812
(ENGINE STARTS)

22:19.853 --> 22:23.224
(CELLPHONE VIBRATING)

22:24.761 --> 22:25.848
Hey!

22:26.722 --> 22:27.918
I got you.

22:28.485 --> 22:29.391
You did.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.600
Hello, sister.

22:35.227 --> 22:36.968
Hello, brother.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.699
Where are you?

22:42.700 --> 22:44.135
(INHALES DEEPLY)

22:44.136 --> 22:47.139
On the front steps at Mama's.

22:48.607 --> 22:52.544
She told me that you
moved back temporarily.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.331
One hopes.

22:55.714 --> 22:57.149
Where are you?

22:58.132 --> 23:00.450
At my friend's loft.

23:00.451 --> 23:03.286
Mom told me about your amazing friend

23:03.287 --> 23:06.224
and her amazing loft.

23:08.226 --> 23:09.159
Yeah.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.797
She went home, too...

23:12.965 --> 23:14.467
To Ohio.

23:15.467 --> 23:17.133
I'm sorry, honey.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.315
Don't get attached to people.

23:20.515 --> 23:22.174
There's a downside.

23:23.542 --> 23:24.664
Too late.

23:25.209 --> 23:27.068
(CHUCKLES)

23:27.512 --> 23:29.148
You gonna be okay?

23:31.248 --> 23:32.623
I'm gonna try.

23:34.619 --> 23:37.154
I'm gonna try to be okay.

23:37.155 --> 23:40.326
I'll come up there. Right now.

23:40.664 --> 23:42.962
You know I will. Just
say the word, Danny.

23:44.429 --> 23:46.498
How would you get here?

23:49.167 --> 23:50.735
Does everybody know about my car?

23:50.736 --> 23:52.535
(LAUGHS)

23:52.536 --> 23:54.526
Yes. (LAUGHS)

23:55.474 --> 23:57.440
I'll take Jared's bike.

23:57.441 --> 23:59.443
Been there, done that.

23:59.444 --> 24:01.047
He's got a better one now.

24:01.580 --> 24:03.014
See you soon, then.

24:03.015 --> 24:04.316
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

24:08.486 --> 24:10.622
You know I miss the shit
out of you, brother.

24:14.913 --> 24:16.982
I miss you too, Amantha.

24:18.764 --> 24:20.630
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

24:20.631 --> 24:25.503
I-I sure appreciate all your letters,

24:25.504 --> 24:27.705
every last word.

24:29.073 --> 24:31.977
My letters then, or now?

24:33.411 --> 24:34.479
Both.

24:35.746 --> 24:38.443
But the recent ones are special,

24:38.816 --> 24:44.489
because nobody reads them but me.

24:53.098 --> 24:54.600
Jon's coming to see ya.

24:55.766 --> 24:57.400
Oh, yeah?

24:57.401 --> 24:59.270
I'm sure he'll call first,

24:59.985 --> 25:01.686
but things are changing.

25:02.274 --> 25:03.803
They usually do.

25:04.642 --> 25:08.472
I mean down here, in Paulie.

25:09.380 --> 25:13.350
The truth may be finding the light

25:13.351 --> 25:15.295
after all these years.

25:17.188 --> 25:18.696
Did you know that

25:19.097 --> 25:23.068
Harry Nilsson and John Lennon
made a record together?

25:27.298 --> 25:28.866
No. (CHUCKLES)

25:28.867 --> 25:30.601
I didn't.

25:30.602 --> 25:32.670
Neither did I.

25:33.604 --> 25:36.074
I've got a lot of catching up to do.

25:37.409 --> 25:38.643
Me too.

25:40.478 --> 25:42.573
Tell Jared I said hi.

25:43.681 --> 25:45.250
I will.

26:40.379 --> 26:42.091
NATE: That's tough, Dan.

26:42.092 --> 26:43.557
That really is.

26:44.441 --> 26:47.880
Women... they're what makes
this world go around.

26:49.415 --> 26:51.282
They can sure make the world feel like

26:51.283 --> 26:53.903
it's got some kind of direction, yes.

26:54.487 --> 26:57.788
Sounds like you cared a
lot about this lady, Dan.

26:58.444 --> 27:00.236
I did, Tyrus.

27:00.691 --> 27:02.184
I still do.

27:03.216 --> 27:05.196
AVERY: 'Course you do, Dan.

27:05.197 --> 27:07.564
We don't want to trivialize
your experience with Chloe.

27:07.565 --> 27:10.367
But, um, circumstances
being what they are,

27:10.368 --> 27:11.968
her going back to her family

27:11.969 --> 27:14.604
feels like the right decision for her.

27:14.605 --> 27:18.274
And you staying here
focusing on your therapy,

27:18.275 --> 27:19.610
creating a job history,

27:19.611 --> 27:21.645
gaining some life under your belt...

27:21.646 --> 27:24.515
that's... that's right thinking, Dan.

27:26.902 --> 27:27.984
I guess.

27:28.852 --> 27:30.987
Sometimes you just wonder.

27:30.988 --> 27:32.591
Wonder?

27:33.858 --> 27:35.825
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

27:35.826 --> 27:37.862
Ah, you're going back
to that now, are you?

27:43.334 --> 27:45.835
Sometimes you just wonder,

27:45.836 --> 27:47.838
is that what we're doing here?

27:47.839 --> 27:50.608
Keeping our expectations so low

27:50.609 --> 27:53.010
we'll never be disappointed?

27:53.011 --> 27:55.411
I pull boxes.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.014
Tyrus makes cold calls.

27:57.015 --> 28:00.851
Pickles' is about to start
washing other people's clothes.

28:00.852 --> 28:02.620
Is that as good as it gets?

28:02.621 --> 28:06.422
Is that all we should hope for?

28:06.423 --> 28:09.375
Not everybody's expectations
are the same, Daniel.

28:10.194 --> 28:11.661
If you don't like your circumstance,

28:11.662 --> 28:14.264
you've either got to try to
change that circumstance,

28:14.265 --> 28:16.800
or if you can't, or if it's unrealistic,

28:16.801 --> 28:18.901
you gotta change your
attitude towards it.

28:18.902 --> 28:21.772
- Sure.
- Sure?

28:21.773 --> 28:23.674
Sure.

28:23.675 --> 28:27.678
What you said is, um,
logical, practical,

28:27.679 --> 28:30.313
predictable, realistic.

28:30.314 --> 28:31.849
Sure.

28:31.850 --> 28:38.722
I think what you experiencing,
though uncomfortable,

28:38.723 --> 28:41.166
is ultimately positive, Daniel...

28:42.393 --> 28:44.828
that you even having expectations,

28:44.829 --> 28:47.066
that you feeling disappointment.

28:47.732 --> 28:49.433
You know, to me,

28:49.434 --> 28:54.304
expectation is kinda like the
trickier cousin to hope.

28:54.305 --> 28:55.872
You hope for something better, right?

28:55.873 --> 28:57.373
You hope for something different,

28:57.374 --> 28:58.843
something more.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.481
That's not a bad thing, you know?

29:06.423 --> 29:08.951
When's the last time you
felt disappointment,

29:08.952 --> 29:11.256
'cause you hoped for something?

29:15.826 --> 29:17.828
Now, I guarantee you're no different

29:17.829 --> 29:19.063
than any man in this room.

29:25.469 --> 29:27.472
You in good company, Daniel.

29:29.206 --> 29:30.441
Welcome.

30:10.489 --> 30:12.591
JANET: Good morning, Theodore.

30:18.297 --> 30:20.433
You haven't called me
that in a long time.

30:21.899 --> 30:23.902
- Shame on me.
- Mm.

30:25.270 --> 30:27.053
Are you ready for the big day?

30:28.704 --> 30:32.070
I'm kind of ready for the
day after the big day.

30:32.071 --> 30:33.579
See what that brings.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.254
Why not?

30:37.882 --> 30:39.351
Why not?

30:44.028 --> 30:46.231
Uh, incoming offspring.

30:48.676 --> 30:50.061
Where's Amantha?

30:50.462 --> 30:52.296
She said this is your thing.

30:52.297 --> 30:53.463
Said, "Go with God."

30:53.464 --> 30:54.819
What about you?

30:56.301 --> 30:58.227
I think it's my thing too, Mom.

31:01.439 --> 31:03.840
We'll see you over there a little later.

31:03.841 --> 31:05.410
Okay.

31:06.645 --> 31:08.214
It's gonna be fine.

31:12.016 --> 31:14.219
Well, let's do it.

31:22.887 --> 31:24.193
DR. MILCH: So, how you been?

31:25.889 --> 31:27.431
Trying to stay the course.

31:27.432 --> 31:29.739
Doing my prescribed homework.

31:30.706 --> 31:32.279
How's that going for you?

31:32.793 --> 31:34.439
Not fun yet.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.519
Not fun?

31:38.243 --> 31:40.478
Still pretty traumatic to listen to.

31:41.288 --> 31:42.447
I see.

31:43.137 --> 31:45.287
Am I the hopeless case?

31:45.606 --> 31:46.873
Not at all.

31:46.874 --> 31:48.107
With Prolonged Exposure Therapy,

31:48.108 --> 31:50.176
I've seen patients show
marked improvement

31:50.177 --> 31:51.912
after as few as 8 to 10 sessions,

31:53.017 --> 31:54.815
while others take more time.

31:55.158 --> 31:59.019
A year of concentrated
therapy isn't unusual.

31:59.020 --> 32:02.623
But for now, we'll continue
to address your major traumas

32:02.624 --> 32:05.491
until you become more
desensitized to them...

32:05.492 --> 32:06.994
go from there.

32:09.164 --> 32:10.897
Very well, doctor.

32:10.898 --> 32:12.633
You ready to begin?

32:14.635 --> 32:18.137
I-I would like to talk
about another event today,

32:18.138 --> 32:19.875
if that's all right?

32:20.892 --> 32:21.976
Absolutely.

32:23.177 --> 32:25.245
I think about it a lot.

32:26.513 --> 32:30.225
Every time I hear
footsteps in a hallway,

32:31.205 --> 32:32.820
it comes back.

32:33.655 --> 32:35.391
I see.

32:36.891 --> 32:40.093
Oh. (EXHALES SHARPLY)

32:40.094 --> 32:40.983
Right.

32:41.649 --> 32:43.937
Homework.

32:46.371 --> 32:48.436
It was my friend's execution.

32:49.837 --> 32:52.508
Well, the day before, actually.

32:53.774 --> 32:54.942
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)

32:59.681 --> 33:01.116
Whenever you're ready.

33:08.556 --> 33:09.958
(INHALES DEEPLY)

33:12.260 --> 33:13.895
I'm ready.

33:14.548 --> 33:16.464
Where are you, Daniel?

33:17.898 --> 33:21.296
In my cell. Waiting.

33:22.803 --> 33:27.838
Kerwin is in his cell
next to mine... waiting.

33:29.577 --> 33:30.877
No one is talking,

33:30.878 --> 33:33.714
not even Wendall, who never shuts up.

33:34.635 --> 33:36.568
It's the rare occasion

33:37.050 --> 33:39.118
when the entire row is silent.

33:39.119 --> 33:44.193
We're all just... waiting.

33:48.229 --> 33:50.799
What is it?

33:53.067 --> 33:58.006
The doors are opening into the row.

34:00.575 --> 34:03.042
We can hear their footsteps, the guards,

34:03.043 --> 34:04.912
coming to take him.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.815
Try to stay in the first person.

34:11.251 --> 34:14.085
That's not how it is on this day.

34:15.188 --> 34:18.583
It's like we're somehow united,

34:18.893 --> 34:21.594
even the inmates you hate,

34:21.596 --> 34:23.730
even the inmates you don't really know.

34:23.731 --> 34:27.683
It... it feels like
we're all being taken

34:28.703 --> 34:31.839
for our date with the executioner.

34:33.641 --> 34:35.431
But we're not.

34:37.612 --> 34:41.618
It's just Kerwin they're taking.

34:43.850 --> 34:49.223
I see the guards walk past me now.

34:50.657 --> 34:56.130
I hear them stop at his cell,
put the chains on him.

34:58.333 --> 35:00.801
I want to be strong for him.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.661
I hear him ask the guards if...

35:07.007 --> 35:08.776
if he can have a word with me.

35:12.079 --> 35:14.016
But I can't face him.

35:17.284 --> 35:20.788
He's the one who's strong...

35:22.924 --> 35:24.992
For me.

35:27.895 --> 35:30.299
Finally, I turn to him.

35:33.367 --> 35:35.306
"Because I know you.

35:36.070 --> 35:37.862
Because I know you.

35:39.741 --> 35:41.696
Because I know you."

35:43.866 --> 35:45.347
I don't follow.

35:47.114 --> 35:49.665
That... That's what he kept saying...

35:50.784 --> 35:54.020
His last words to me
before they took him away.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.991
He wanted me to believe.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.093
Believe?

36:01.663 --> 36:03.238
In myself.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.552
I like learning things.

36:26.553 --> 36:28.889
Not real big on the other parts of it.

36:29.577 --> 36:32.361
I was never big on much of any of it.

36:34.046 --> 36:36.214
But I think it's important to go,

36:36.544 --> 36:37.879
to finish.

36:40.178 --> 36:42.884
I'm sure people smarter than
me have told you that before.

36:43.563 --> 36:45.385
I don't know if they were smarter,

36:45.386 --> 36:48.290
but it's good to hear
things more than once.

36:58.966 --> 37:01.903
It was nice of your mom to
accept my mom's invitation.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.876
I think she was kind
of moved by it, Bobby.

37:44.245 --> 37:46.652
She hardly had to open a book.

37:47.311 --> 37:50.512
Daniel always commented
on how bright Hanna was,

37:51.486 --> 37:53.315
you know, when... when they were dating.

37:54.715 --> 37:57.445
Well, he was always a
smart boy, as I remember.

37:58.244 --> 38:00.267
I'm sure he still is.

38:01.059 --> 38:03.762
Well, we mothers like to think so.

38:07.831 --> 38:11.002
I don't think your son
killed my daughter anymore.

38:11.604 --> 38:12.718
I don't.

38:13.602 --> 38:17.610
I just didn't want to
let it go, that belief.

38:19.344 --> 38:21.614
But my son, Bobby...

38:26.550 --> 38:31.356
(VOICE BREAKING) What they told
us was wrong all this time.

38:32.891 --> 38:36.595
I'm so, so sorry for your loss, Judy.

38:42.099 --> 38:45.069
I thought if they killed your son,

38:45.659 --> 38:49.268
it would help me move on.

38:50.581 --> 38:54.019
Now I just thank the Lord they didn't.

38:56.380 --> 39:00.451
(NORMAL VOICE) And I hope you can have
some kind of life with him, Janet.

Even if they get the right
one, or ones, this time...

39:25.409 --> 39:28.746
I don't think it'd make
that big of a difference,

39:30.133 --> 39:34.086
not to me, not anymore.

39:36.887 --> 39:38.716
I understand.

39:44.753 --> 39:49.067
I don't think I'll ever be
able to change this room.

39:50.114 --> 39:53.326
I know Bobby wishes I would, but, um...

39:54.706 --> 39:56.463
it's just been too long.

39:58.658 --> 40:00.512
It's too set.

40:01.846 --> 40:03.782
Well...

40:04.510 --> 40:06.585
Maybe it's all right just as it is.

40:14.992 --> 40:16.738
It makes me sad,

40:17.494 --> 40:19.498
but it comforts me, too.

40:21.166 --> 40:22.934
I feel that in here.

40:24.001 --> 40:25.352
Both.

40:28.873 --> 40:30.976
It's a nice room, Judy.

40:33.777 --> 40:35.646
Well, thank you.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.130
Anyway, a formal request
has been made to the GBI

40:44.131 --> 40:44.951
by Ms. Person.

40:45.361 --> 40:46.728
It's in their hands now.

40:46.729 --> 40:50.433
How we proceed depends
on their response.

40:53.602 --> 40:55.504
How was Mother with all this?

40:56.705 --> 40:58.210
It was complicated for her,

40:59.707 --> 41:02.410
but I sensed in her hope.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.349
I would say she's hopeful.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.795
I like to hear that.

41:10.519 --> 41:11.921
How are you with it?

41:14.156 --> 41:16.379
I'm not sure yet, uh...

41:17.725 --> 41:20.161
Sounds like a lot would have to happen,

41:20.162 --> 41:22.630
but, uh, let's just say

41:22.631 --> 41:26.501
it might be nice to go
home one day for a visit,

41:26.502 --> 41:27.802
just because I wanted to.

41:27.803 --> 41:29.970
That might be nice.

41:29.971 --> 41:31.707
That's what we're aiming for.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.511
It's good to see you, Jon.

41:36.126 --> 41:37.434
Likewise, Daniel.

41:37.435 --> 41:41.156
I really appreciate your
sacrifices over the years.

41:43.718 --> 41:46.755
I don't think it's a sacrifice
if it's one's choice.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.592
(SIGHS)

41:51.593 --> 41:54.595
As I lay in bed last night, I thought...

41:54.596 --> 41:57.465
I thought about how many people

41:57.466 --> 42:00.635
have tried to help me along the way,

42:00.636 --> 42:02.199
have helped me,

42:03.004 --> 42:05.508
a few of who are no longer alive.

42:06.975 --> 42:09.744
Way more people have
tried to help me, Jon,

42:09.745 --> 42:11.813
than have harmed me.

42:11.814 --> 42:15.017
The harm just seems to
leave the deeper mark.

42:16.551 --> 42:19.686
Anyway, uh, I've always felt such guilt

42:19.687 --> 42:22.155
that others were wasting
their lives on me,

42:22.156 --> 42:27.128
that I was a waste, that I was unworthy.

42:27.129 --> 42:29.996
But last night, I...

42:29.997 --> 42:34.135
I didn't feel that guilt,
or that I was a waste.

42:35.114 --> 42:38.505
I didn't necessarily feel,
uh, uh, worthiness,

42:38.506 --> 42:44.713
but I did feel a kind of
responsibility, I guess.

42:47.749 --> 42:53.156
At least a... a desire to try
and not let you all down.

42:54.890 --> 43:01.095
And then I felt the
smallest flicker of...

43:01.096 --> 43:03.900
not wanting to let
myself down, you know?

43:05.000 --> 43:09.003
Because somewhere in all this,

43:09.004 --> 43:10.938
I've managed at times

43:10.939 --> 43:14.175
to fight for myself for some reason,

43:14.176 --> 43:17.577
to fight for my life for some reason.

43:17.578 --> 43:22.584
And I... survived for some reason.

43:24.252 --> 43:30.157
And here I am, still, for some reason.

43:30.158 --> 43:32.126
And me not knowing that reason

43:32.127 --> 43:36.931
doesn't diminish it or invalidate it

43:36.932 --> 43:39.968
or disprove its existence.

43:43.351 --> 43:46.296
And that's what I'm going
with today, Mr. Stern.

43:47.575 --> 43:49.400
No promises beyond that.

43:51.546 --> 43:55.050
Words to live by, Mr. Holden, for today.

44:15.517 --> 44:16.986
Double Dee?

44:24.645 --> 44:26.147
Don't play hard to get now.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.524
(SIGHS)

44:36.091 --> 44:38.127
For real, Dee, you gonna do me that way?

44:42.163 --> 44:43.232
What?

44:47.970 --> 44:49.906
You ever dream of being somewhere else?

44:51.707 --> 44:53.240
No.

44:53.241 --> 44:54.810
Yeah, you do.

44:55.711 --> 44:57.144
It's fruitless.

44:57.145 --> 44:58.345
Says who?

44:58.346 --> 44:59.926
DANIEL: It's not real.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.754
KERWIN: And this place is?

45:06.187 --> 45:07.656
Yes.

45:09.191 --> 45:12.393
How you know if this is real,

45:12.394 --> 45:14.250
and what you dream ain't?

45:15.631 --> 45:18.527
Because who would dream
up something like this?

45:22.104 --> 45:23.973

Where are we?

46:22.096 --> 46:23.225
Hell, yeah.

46:26.334 --> 46:27.367
You are.

46:39.714 --> 46:41.950
You're extraordinarily competent.

46:43.118 --> 46:45.219
It's like riding a bicycle, bitch.

46:56.016 --> 46:59.335
They're a sight, and we're seeing them.

47:01.502 --> 47:03.058
Hey, ladies.

We new here.

(BOTH LAUGH)

47:13.982 --> 47:15.350
Hang a left, Kerwin.

47:15.985 --> 47:17.673
Let's go to the Village.

47:18.802 --> 47:21.423
Circa 1965.

47:23.424 --> 47:25.760
I want to go to a Broadway show.

47:25.761 --> 47:28.394
- Present day.
- We can do that later.

47:28.395 --> 47:31.490
- Good seats, too.
- Already reserved.

47:31.491 --> 47:33.967
And not one of those
hokey-ass revivals either...

47:33.968 --> 47:36.003
buncha white folks singing
'bout the good old days.

47:36.004 --> 47:40.810
Can we just take in the city
for a minute without talking?

47:41.942 --> 47:43.943
Sure.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.480
No sweat, Dee.

47:51.051 --> 47:52.519
KERWIN: Can I turn on the radio?

47:52.520 --> 47:55.390
Yes, Kerwin, you can turn on the radio.

47:56.957 --> 47:58.057
Hip hop?

47:58.058 --> 47:59.361
Kerwin.

47:59.722 --> 48:01.057
Okay.

48:01.363 --> 48:03.703

me for a ride, Dee.

He was Amantha's landlord,
and how he's mine.

49:05.489 --> 49:08.258
He deserves another 20 percent off then.

SONDRA: Good afternoon.

52:18.846 --> 52:22.538
This morning, I spoke with GBI
Deputy Director Mike Larkin,

52:22.539 --> 52:25.907
and he confirmed that the GBI
will open a new investigation

52:25.908 --> 52:29.478
into the murder of Hanna Abigail Dean.

52:29.479 --> 52:32.681
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)

52:32.682 --> 52:36.384
The GBI is opening this
case at my request.

52:36.385 --> 52:38.922
It was not a request I made lightly.

52:39.571 --> 52:40.922
The original investigation

52:40.923 --> 52:43.992
helped convict 18-year-old
Daniel Lucas Holden

52:43.993 --> 52:45.695
of Ms. Dean's murder,

52:45.696 --> 52:47.896
and he spent the next almost two decades

52:47.897 --> 52:49.726
on Georgia's death row.

52:50.566 --> 52:51.900
Earlier this year,

52:51.901 --> 52:54.603
a court vacated Mr. Holden's conviction

52:54.604 --> 52:56.871
based on new DNA evidence,

52:56.872 --> 52:58.708
and he was released from prison

52:58.709 --> 53:02.061
for the first time since
his original arrest.

53:03.027 --> 53:04.947
At the time of his release,

53:04.948 --> 53:06.648
I reviewed all the evidence

53:06.649 --> 53:10.126
and concluded that Mr.
Holden should be retried.

53:11.176 --> 53:15.590
In order to spare the taxpayers
the expense of a second trial,

53:15.591 --> 53:18.018
I offered Mr. Holden a plea deal,

53:18.019 --> 53:19.406
which he accepted.

53:20.167 --> 53:22.797
He pled guilty to Ms. Dean's murder

53:22.798 --> 53:24.967
in exchange for time served,

53:24.968 --> 53:26.969
20 years probation,

53:26.970 --> 53:29.838
and banishment from
the state of Georgia.

53:29.839 --> 53:32.608
In the days and weeks since, however,

53:32.609 --> 53:34.009
details have come to light

53:34.010 --> 53:36.045
that raise doubts about
Mr. Holden's guilt.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.413
You hearing this, Mr. Melton?

53:38.414 --> 53:41.248
One of the witnesses
at the original trial,

53:41.249 --> 53:43.953
George Melton, was found dead,

53:43.954 --> 53:46.390
apparently the victim of foul play.

53:47.658 --> 53:51.393
Testing revealed that Mr. Melton's DNA

53:51.394 --> 53:53.362
is a statistical match

53:53.363 --> 53:55.998
to the semen found on Ms.
Dean's underclothing

53:55.999 --> 53:58.467

54:08.944 --> 54:10.945
And the Paulie Sheriff's Department,

54:10.946 --> 54:12.715
it has become evident

54:12.716 --> 54:15.650
that the original investigation
was far from thorough,

54:15.651 --> 54:18.521
neglecting to interview key witnesses

54:18.522 --> 54:20.790
and failing to correctly identify

54:20.791 --> 54:23.358
the individuals who raped Hanna Dean

54:23.359 --> 54:24.626
on the night of her death.

54:24.627 --> 54:26.494
Bitch.

54:26.495 --> 54:28.063
After careful consideration,

54:28.064 --> 54:30.465
and at the urging of Sheriff Daggett,

54:30.466 --> 54:32.067
my office formally submitted

54:32.068 --> 54:34.337
a request for a new investigation

54:34.338 --> 54:37.038
to the GBI earlier this week.

54:37.039 --> 54:39.041
Sheriff Daggett and I both believe

54:39.042 --> 54:42.545
that this case is too
important and too complex

54:42.546 --> 54:43.945
for the limited resources

54:43.946 --> 54:46.581
available to the Paulie
Sheriff's Department.

54:46.582 --> 54:50.753
Bringing in an outside agency
to oversee the investigation

54:50.754 --> 54:54.889
is a step we feel is both
necessary and prudent.

54:54.890 --> 54:56.458
And as I said this morning,

54:56.459 --> 54:58.427
the Georgia Bureau of Investigation

54:58.428 --> 55:01.931
confirmed that they have
accepted my request.

55:01.932 --> 55:04.699
And whatever the results
of their findings,

55:04.700 --> 55:09.070
this office is prepared
to do whatever it takes

55:09.071 --> 55:11.139
to find and try

55:11.140 --> 55:15.043
the individuals responsible
for Hanna Dean's murder.

55:15.044 --> 55:17.579
And if it becomes clear

55:17.580 --> 55:20.715
that Daniel Holden is not
guilty of this crime,

55:20.716 --> 55:23.985
then my office will work
with Mr. Holden's attorney

55:23.986 --> 55:29.327
to see that his conviction is
set aside once and for all.

Hanna's death on me now?

56:53.803 --> 56:55.306
Is that right?

56:57.740 --> 57:01.409
I went over to his house

57:01.410 --> 57:03.512
to see if he was gonna buckle.

57:03.513 --> 57:05.783
Now, why would he buckle?

57:06.749 --> 57:08.750
If Hanna cried rape,

57:08.751 --> 57:10.719
I wasn't going down for that.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.487
I didn't rape her, Carl.

- What?
- Chris' right hand.

keep her from screaming.

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:58.197
Yeah, but you don't know that.

01:00:58.198 --> 01:01:01.001
(LAUGHTER)

01:01:04.539 --> 01:01:05.774
What a day.

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:08.542
One to remember, for sure.

01:01:10.822 --> 01:01:12.613
It was a blessed day.

01:01:13.647 --> 01:01:15.021
It was at that.

01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:18.117
Plus, Teddy hasn't run off Billy yet.

01:01:18.118 --> 01:01:19.653
Day ain't over yet.

01:01:20.153 --> 01:01:21.186
Getting close.

01:01:21.187 --> 01:01:23.023
(LAUGHTER)

01:01:23.024 --> 01:01:25.824
(CELLPHONE VIBRATING)

01:01:25.825 --> 01:01:27.561
It's Daniel.

01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:29.996
JANET: Hey, honey.

01:01:29.997 --> 01:01:31.598
Did you get my message?

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:32.898
DANIEL: I did.

01:01:32.899 --> 01:01:34.457
Isn't that something?

01:01:34.868 --> 01:01:37.103
I think our luck's about to change,

01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:39.172
has changed.

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:41.608
Well, it's... it's still a long road,

01:01:41.609 --> 01:01:46.746
but I think we can afford to be hopeful.

01:01:46.747 --> 01:01:48.649
Why not?

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.386
Why not?

01:01:50.387 --> 01:01:51.083
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:52.217
TED JR.: (WHISPERING) Hey.

01:01:52.218 --> 01:01:54.253
Can I maybe say something to him

01:01:54.254 --> 01:01:55.654
when you're done?

01:01:55.655 --> 01:01:59.126
Honey, Teddy wants to talk to you.

01:02:02.229 --> 01:02:05.233
Okay, sure.

01:02:14.274 --> 01:02:15.618
Hi, there, Daniel.

01:02:17.232 --> 01:02:18.845
Hello, Ted.

01:02:19.254 --> 01:02:21.313
I just wanted you to know

01:02:21.314 --> 01:02:23.049
that I've got the Ceramic Mechanic,

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:26.122
and, well...

01:02:27.622 --> 01:02:28.922
It was your dad's,

01:02:28.923 --> 01:02:30.724
and I think it should be yours.

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:32.065
That's just how I feel.

01:02:33.995 --> 01:02:37.730
That's thoughtful, Ted, but, uh,

01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:40.099
I... I was never really
that attached to it,

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.524
to be honest.

01:02:42.328 --> 01:02:44.836
And I know it means a lot to you.

01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:50.535
It did,

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.179
but things change.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.357
Uh...

01:02:57.952 --> 01:03:00.376
Want to just leave it here
at the house for now?

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:03.724
I'd... I'd like that, Ted.

01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:08.247
And, uh...

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:14.960
I'm really sorry for what's
happened to you, Daniel.

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:18.964
Sounds like things are on the up and up.

01:03:20.908 --> 01:03:22.775
I'm sorry too, Ted.

01:03:27.914 --> 01:03:30.904
I know everybody here hopes
you come home real soon.

01:03:31.318 --> 01:03:33.655
It'd be nice to visit, it sure would.

01:03:34.187 --> 01:03:36.265
We'll leave the light
on for you. (CHUCKLES)

01:03:40.026 --> 01:03:44.063
There's someone else here who
would like to say howdy.

01:03:44.064 --> 01:03:45.733
DANIEL: Okay, Ted.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.416
Hello, Daniel.

01:04:05.118 --> 01:04:06.829
Hello, Tawney.

01:04:08.722 --> 01:04:12.442
I pray for you, Daniel, every day.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.829
Might be working.

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.092
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:19.901
How are you doing?

01:04:21.135 --> 01:04:24.204
Mm, I'm...

01:04:24.205 --> 01:04:26.240
I'm looking forward to my life,

01:04:27.006 --> 01:04:29.443
maybe for the first time in my life.

01:04:30.376 --> 01:04:32.575
That's good to hear, Tawney.

01:04:33.508 --> 01:04:35.073
How about you?

01:04:37.218 --> 01:04:38.986
I'm, um...

01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:44.536
Cautiously optimistic.

01:04:46.359 --> 01:04:47.729
That's something.

01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:50.364
I'll take it.

01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:55.423
I hope your life's filled
with wonder, Daniel.

01:04:58.772 --> 01:05:00.207
Yours, too.

01:05:03.176 --> 01:05:05.277
Well, um...

01:05:05.278 --> 01:05:07.126
I'll give you back to your mama.

01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:10.884
(SIGHS)

01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:12.320
Bye, Tawney.

01:05:13.553 --> 01:05:15.356
Bye, Daniel.

01:05:20.361 --> 01:05:21.464
Hey.

01:05:22.296 --> 01:05:25.498
Oh, we just pigged out on Willie D's.

01:05:25.499 --> 01:05:27.400
Pun intended.

01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:30.837
DANIEL: Well, I went to Darley's
with Pickle and the boys.

01:05:30.838 --> 01:05:32.070
Oh, that sounds good.

01:05:32.071 --> 01:05:34.174
Yeah, me three.

01:05:34.175 --> 01:05:36.141
What vegetables did you get?

01:05:36.142 --> 01:05:39.534
Vegetables? There was a strange variety.
