00:05.620 --> 00:08.460
ELENA:  They say every story
has a beginning.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.460
Except mine.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.580
My story has two.

00:12.580 --> 00:16.040
That's me,
Princess Elena of Avalor,

00:16.040 --> 00:18.210
on my 15th birthday.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.620
My parents gave me
a special gift that day.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.960
A magical amulet
they said would always
protect me from harm.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.170
I didn't think
I'd ever need it.

00:27.170 --> 00:29.710
But one fateful day,

00:29.710 --> 00:32.710
an evil, power-hungry
sorceress named Shuriki

00:32.710 --> 00:34.000
invaded Avalor.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.620
She attacked my parents,

00:36.620 --> 00:38.790
then came after
the rest of us.

00:38.790 --> 00:41.540
Our royal wizard Alacazar
knew a spell

00:41.540 --> 00:44.500
that could protect my little
sister and grandparents

00:44.500 --> 00:46.040
in an enchanted painting.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.000
But he needed time
to cast it.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.120
So I decided to face
Shuriki on my own.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.750
Shuriki tried
to strike me down,

00:55.750 --> 00:57.750
but the amulet
saved my life

00:57.750 --> 00:59.960
by pulling me inside it.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.290
Alacazar found the amulet,

01:02.290 --> 01:04.790
and summoned his spirit
animal Zuzo,

01:04.790 --> 01:07.750
who sent him on
a journey to free me.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.460
It took a little longer
than I'd hoped.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.750
Forty-one years.

01:12.750 --> 01:17.120
But one magical day,
I was freed from the amulet.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.750
It was finally my time
to take back my kingdom.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.040
I rescued my grandparents
and sister Isabel

01:23.040 --> 01:25.380
from the enchanted painting,

01:25.380 --> 01:28.330
and with the help of
the brave people of Avalor,

01:28.330 --> 01:31.330
I defeated
the wicked sorceress.

01:31.330 --> 01:33.710
Avalor was free once more,

01:33.710 --> 01:38.080
and as heir to the throne,
I was gonna be the new ruler.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.750
So, as it turned out,
my adventure wasn't over.

01:41.750 --> 01:45.580
It was just beginning...

for these shenanigans.

Oh, what are you
so cranky about, Migs?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.670
The evil queen is gone,

03:11.670 --> 03:13.750
the majesty of Avalor
has returned,

03:13.750 --> 03:16.170
and we are back
on the flag.

03:16.170 --> 03:18.750
Strike a pose!

03:20.000 --> 03:22.750
Hey, let's go see if
Princess Elena's up.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.380
- Great idea.
- Uh-uh.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.120
No way, you two.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.250
It's bad enough
you woke me up.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.790
Should we knock?

03:34.790 --> 03:37.000
- She is now.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.250
Well, good morning!

03:39.250 --> 03:42.000
Sorry if they
woke you up, princess.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.790
Woke me up
I barely slept last night.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.710
I mean, how are you
supposed to sleep

03:46.710 --> 03:48.290
the night before
you become queen?

03:48.290 --> 03:50.080
So when do you
get your crown?

03:50.080 --> 03:51.710
Tonight at
the Royal Ball.

03:51.710 --> 03:53.750
We will be there.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.710
Uh, we were not
invited, Skylar.

03:55.710 --> 03:57.210
Oh, you're always
invited.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.170
I'll see you tonight.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.620
Zuzo?

04:03.620 --> 04:05.670
- Uh, yeah.

04:05.670 --> 04:06.960
Can you see me now?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.460
- Yeah.

04:08.460 --> 04:09.960
- Yep.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.830
A little too closely,
but yeah.

04:11.830 --> 04:14.170
Um, I thought I couldn't
see spirit animals

04:14.170 --> 04:15.750
unless a wizard
conjured them up.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.750
I thought so, too.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.210
Hm. So why can I?

04:20.210 --> 04:23.380
I have no idea.
Do you?

04:23.380 --> 04:26.580
Well, you know, I have
felt a little...

04:26.580 --> 04:29.210
uh, different, since
I was freed from the amulet.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.040
Now that you mention it,

04:31.040 --> 04:33.330
you were trapped in there
for a long time.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.580
Maybe, when you got
out of the amulet,

04:35.580 --> 04:37.460
you took some of
its magic with you.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.210
So I'm magical now?

04:39.210 --> 04:41.000
I'm just throwin'
out guesses.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.580
But whatever's goin' on,
it's all good,

04:43.580 --> 04:45.580
'cause now, you can get
an extra helping

04:45.580 --> 04:48.250
of animal spirit wisdom
any time you like.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.540
In fact, I'm gonna hit you
with some right now.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.120
If you don't get downstairs
right away,

04:53.120 --> 04:55.750
you're gonna be
late for breakfast.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.670
Ha ha.
That's spirit wisdom?

04:58.670 --> 05:01.380
Oh, go on. You don't want it
to get cold now

05:01.380 --> 05:02.790
Go on, go on.

05:02.790 --> 05:05.830
Isabel.
Time for breakfast.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.250
- I know.
- Oh! You're up already.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.790
How can I sleep after
being trapped

05:10.790 --> 05:12.580
in an enchanted painting
for 41 years?

05:12.580 --> 05:15.040
That's 14,965 days.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.380
There's so much stuff
I wanna do.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.620
Ooh, what's that?

05:18.620 --> 05:20.620
Well, since I'm getting
a crown today,

05:20.620 --> 05:22.580
I wanted to get you
something, too.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.170
A journal!

05:25.170 --> 05:28.210
Yeah, and you can use it
to design all your inventions.

05:28.210 --> 05:31.380
"To my little sister,
for your big ideas.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.830
Love, Elena."

05:32.830 --> 05:34.540
Thanks, Elena.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.250
You're the best
big sister.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.920
But am I the fastest?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.790
Race you to breakfast!

05:41.790 --> 05:44.750
The food is getting
cold,  abuela.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.750
Oh, we can wait
a little longer, Esteban.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.920
- On your left.
- On your right.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.710
Racing through the palace?

05:52.710 --> 05:55.790
This is no way
for princesses to behave.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.620
Don't worry, cousin.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.790
After tonight, Elena
won't be a princess anymore.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.750
She'll be queen.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.580
Um...

06:03.580 --> 06:05.000
Should I tell her?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.500
Tell me what?

06:06.500 --> 06:09.790
Elena, um... you're not
becoming queen tonight.

06:09.790 --> 06:12.380
I was looking through
the kingdom's by-laws
last night,

06:12.380 --> 06:15.500
and discovered that you are
too young to become queen.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.830
Uh, too young?

06:16.830 --> 06:19.380
I was trapped in that amulet
for 41 years.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.960
But you did not
age,  mija.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.960
Technically,
you're still 16.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.670
Your grandmother
is right.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.460
According to the laws,

06:27.460 --> 06:29.710
you must rule Avalor
as crown princess

06:29.710 --> 06:31.120
until you come of age,

06:31.120 --> 06:33.580
with the help of
the Grand Council,

06:33.580 --> 06:35.670
who must approve
all of your major decisions.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.830
I have to get permission
to rule?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.710
Uh, not exactly.

06:39.710 --> 06:42.170
But it's like having
a group of advisors

06:42.170 --> 06:44.750
who can help you make
the best decision.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.380
And look on
the bright side.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.920
There's a bright side?

06:47.920 --> 06:49.830
There's always
a bright side.

06:49.830 --> 06:52.250
You get to choose
the four members
of the Grand Council

06:52.250 --> 06:54.750
tonight at
the Royal Ball.

06:54.750 --> 07:00.420
And may I be the first to offer
my grand counseling services?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.670
That's a kind offer, Esteban,

07:02.670 --> 07:04.790
but I don't think I need
a grand council.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.000
I'm ready to rule now.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.420
This is how
I know you're still a teenager.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.080
You think you're ready,
but ruling a kingdom

07:13.080 --> 07:14.670
is not so simple.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.880
It reminds me of a story.

- Yay!
- Oh!

10:26.330 --> 10:28.290
Your Majesty.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.580
I haven't seen you
in the castle before.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.330
Yeah, it's my first day.

10:32.330 --> 10:35.750
I mean, it's my first day
being your royal guard.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.210
I am Lieutenant
Gabriel Nuñez.

10:37.210 --> 10:39.290
But you can
call me Gabe.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.170
Okay, Gabe.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.210
This way, Elena.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.750
Look how many ships
there are now.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.790
A lot has changed while
you and your sister were gone.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.750
Avalor is now the busiest port
in the world.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.290
Merchants come from all over to
trade in the marketplace

10:53.290 --> 10:54.750
at the Via Mercado.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.420
We'll go there next.

10:56.420 --> 11:00.330
Your Majesty,
I am Captain Turner,
harbor master.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.710
What can I do for you
this fine day?

11:02.710 --> 11:05.670
Actually, I came here
to see what I can do for you.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.460
Is there anything you need
to make the port run better?

11:07.460 --> 11:09.250
Anything I need?

11:09.250 --> 11:12.670
Well, I suppose we could use
a few more docks.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.170
A bigger lighthouse.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.040
( Turner
continues speaking )

11:16.040 --> 11:18.710
- Wow, I better write
some of this down.
- Here you are.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.710
Dad, another ship's
gone missing.

11:20.710 --> 11:23.580
I'm with the princess,
Naomi.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.830
Oh, even better.
She should know
what's going on.

11:25.830 --> 11:28.000
It's the third ship
that's been stolen today.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.750
Three ships?
In one day?

11:30.750 --> 11:33.710
Well, we better start
looking for them right away.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.580
- I'll lead the search.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.960
Just a moment,
Princess Elena.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.210
It is time for you to meet
with Doña Paloma,

11:40.210 --> 11:41.710
the magister of
the trading guild.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.710
I can meet with her
after we find the ships.

11:43.710 --> 11:46.380
No, no. The harbor patrol
will locate the ships.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.330
We've already sent out
a search boat, princess.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.750
See? Your help
is not needed.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.790
Elena, you said you wanted
to meet with the leaders
of the city,

11:53.790 --> 11:56.500
and Doña Paloma
is the most important
leader of them all.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.580
We cannot keep
her waiting.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.290
Of course you can.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.790
You're the one in charge.

12:01.790 --> 12:04.620
So if you wanna
stay and help, stay and help.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.120
For now, let's have
the Navy join the search.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.540
I'll come back right after
I've met with Doña Paloma,

12:09.540 --> 12:11.580
- I promise.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.920
I wanna finish
sketching the boats.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.750
Sure. Uh, Gabe, can you
stay with Isabel?

12:16.750 --> 12:18.790
It would be
my honor.

12:18.790 --> 12:20.710
Thank you.
Esteban.

12:22.540 --> 12:26.620
So, what was it like
when your sister
battled that sorceress?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.750
- Weird.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.120
What was weird about it?

12:31.120 --> 12:33.670
No, that's weird.
Why are dogs boarding a ship?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.580
Let's go investigate.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.750
Princess!

12:50.000 --> 12:51.790
No way.

12:51.790 --> 12:54.750
- I don't know.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.960
- Get him!

12:56.960 --> 12:59.000
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.830
This is so not how I wanted
my first day to go.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.120
What are those...

13:19.120 --> 13:20.750
Oh, no.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.710
...and let me, Doña Paloma,
personally make

13:23.710 --> 13:25.830
all trade deals from now on.

13:25.830 --> 13:28.170
That's
a pretty long list.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.040
Oh, there's more.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.790
But we can discuss it
tonight at the ball.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.250
Another ship was stolen.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.580
- Young lady!

13:35.580 --> 13:36.750
And your sister was on it.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.830
Isabel

13:38.830 --> 13:40.620
And your guard.
They were tied up.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.830
I will alert the Navy
right away.

13:42.830 --> 13:44.670
Higgins, alert the Navy.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.750
I just got Isa back.
I can't lose her again.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.790
What was I thinking? I never
should have left the harbor.

13:49.790 --> 13:52.880
Oh, Skylar.
Skylar!

13:55.540 --> 13:57.080
Is everything
okay, princess?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.750
No. My sister was taken.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.750
- No.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.620
Just when I thought
the kingdom was getting safer.

14:03.620 --> 14:06.040
Climb on. We will
search from the air.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.830
Elena, it is far too dangerous

14:07.830 --> 14:09.620
for you to go after
boat thieves.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.420
If I'm gonna
rule this kingdom,

14:11.420 --> 14:13.380
I can't be afraid of
taking on a few thieves.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.250
- Exactly.
- Come on, Naomi.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.420
Wait, what?
You want me
to go with you?

14:17.420 --> 14:18.880
On one of those things?

14:18.880 --> 14:21.170
Hello. We are jaquins,
national symbols.

14:21.170 --> 14:23.380
You may have seen us
on the flag.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.620
You're the only one
who knows what
the ship looks like.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.620
You'll be fine.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.750
This is so not fine!

14:30.750 --> 14:33.250
LUNA: Hey, watch the feathers,
would ya?

14:35.460 --> 14:36.920
ELENA: Do you see the ship?

14:36.920 --> 14:39.580
No, but that's impossible.
They just left.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.460
Did you see
who stole it?

14:41.460 --> 14:44.040
They were these weird
purplish creatures.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.960
And one of them was breathing
huge gusts of wind.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.380
So they were magical?

14:47.380 --> 14:48.750
Looked like it.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.460
You have any idea
what they are?

14:50.460 --> 14:53.460
No, but I know someone
who might.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.120
Princess Elena!

14:58.330 --> 15:00.620
- Sorta.
- We go to school together.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.960
I need your help, Matteo.
It's an emergency.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.380
Hey, what's with
the bathrobe?

15:05.380 --> 15:07.290
Matteo is a wizard.

15:07.290 --> 15:09.080
- In training.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.790
Since always.
I just had to keep it
a secret before.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.710
My grandfather Alacazar
wrote a book about

15:13.710 --> 15:15.580
all the magical creatures
in the kingdom

15:15.580 --> 15:16.750
when he was
a royal wizard.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.460
Thanks.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.080
Okay, so what did
these creatures look like?

15:23.080 --> 15:25.210
Uh, purple, right,
with pointy ears.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.620
- And spots.
- Hm, that sounds familiar.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.540
Oh, that's them.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.250
Noblins?

15:31.250 --> 15:32.790
Uh-huh. Noblins are magical
shape shifters.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.670
They can transform
into dogs,

15:34.670 --> 15:36.830
and have the power to turn
objects into gold.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.040
I wish I had
that power.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.750
Look here. It says that
the Noblins live deep
in the jungle,

15:41.750 --> 15:43.750
and never stray
far from home.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.580
Then what were they
doing in the city?

15:45.580 --> 15:47.540
Stealing ships,
apparently.

15:47.540 --> 15:48.920
If they don't like
leaving home,

15:48.920 --> 15:50.670
maybe that's where
they're headed.

15:50.670 --> 15:52.790
That's why we didn't see
the ships on the ocean,

15:52.790 --> 15:55.330
because they took them
up the river.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.580
That's where we should look.
Matteo, can you come with?

15:57.580 --> 16:01.710
- We might need
some magical assistance.
- I'm your wizard.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.040
Hey there. I've got
some advice for you.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.620
I'm sorry, Zuzo.
I'm kind of in a hurry.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.790
Well, that's actually
part of the advice.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.580
We'll talk
later.

16:10.580 --> 16:11.830
Okay, suit yourself.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.790
Uh-oh. This is
not good.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.250
What's not good?

16:25.250 --> 16:27.210
They're turning down
a side river.

16:27.210 --> 16:28.960
The more twists
and turns we make,

16:28.960 --> 16:30.620
the harder it'll be
for anyone to find us.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.580
Hmm.
I have an idea.

16:39.710 --> 16:42.000
Elena, there's
a fork in the river.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.460
Which way do we go?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.330
- We could split up.
- No, wait.

16:45.330 --> 16:46.620
There's something
in the water.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.420
How dare they litter
our beautiful kingdom?

16:49.420 --> 16:51.830
It's a page from
Isabel's journal.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.330
She must be
leaving us a trail.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.750
There they are.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.670
MATTEO: What's the plan?

17:02.670 --> 17:04.330
First we untie
Isabel and Gabe.

17:04.330 --> 17:06.750
- Then we get our ship back.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.620
Don't worry. I have
a few tricks up my sleeve.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.620
You've been waiting all day
to say that, haven't you?

17:11.620 --> 17:13.500
Maybe.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.540
Elena!

17:18.380 --> 17:19.750
Isa!

17:19.750 --> 17:21.170
You came for me.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.040
I'm never
losing you again.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.460
Get on the jaquins.
I'll hold them off
until you're safe.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.170
Skylar, protect Isabel.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.040
- You got it.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.790
Taking back our ship.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.830
As the future queen
of Avalor,

17:34.830 --> 17:37.790
I order you to leave
this vessel at once.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.420
I will not let
my noblins be captured again.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.670
Again?

17:45.330 --> 17:47.380
- Get back!
- Vetzi!

17:53.830 --> 17:56.040
Great. Now everyone
wants a ride.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.580
Uh-uh. None of y'all
gettin' on my back.

17:58.580 --> 18:01.000
I'm serious, princess,
you should go.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.460
I'm not going
anywhere.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.880
It's my job
to protect you.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.920
And it's my job
to protect everyone.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.080
Aw!

18:16.080 --> 18:18.540
- Throw her overboard!
!

18:33.460 --> 18:35.040
MATTEO:
Give me back my wand!

18:35.040 --> 18:36.830
So, you have time for
my advice now?

18:36.830 --> 18:38.670
Zuzo, you have to help me
save my friends.

18:38.670 --> 18:40.210
First things first.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.880
Why are you
in such a rush?

18:41.880 --> 18:43.960
Because they're in trouble.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.380
No, no, I mean,
why have you been
rushing around all day?

18:47.380 --> 18:49.000
Oh, uh...

18:49.000 --> 18:51.420
I was trying to prove
that I'm ready to rule now.

18:51.420 --> 18:53.830
And how's that
working out for you?

18:53.830 --> 18:55.580
Not so well.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.540
Hmm. Did you ever
stop and think

18:57.540 --> 19:00.750
why the noblins took the ships
in the first place?

19:00.750 --> 19:03.290
No, but you're right.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.620
I should've.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.420
Ugh, I was so busy
trying to prove

19:07.420 --> 19:10.460
I could be a great queen,
I forgot to act like one.

19:10.460 --> 19:12.540
My grandfather was right.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.500
I'm not ready to rule.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.580
But are you ready
to learn?

19:16.580 --> 19:18.670
'Cause that's all
that matters.

19:18.670 --> 19:20.830
Just take your time,
and you'll do great.

19:23.670 --> 19:26.210
Thanks for the advice, Zuzo.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.250
Aw, giving advice
is easy.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.790
Taking it
is the tough part.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.750
( sounds of fighting
continue )

19:31.750 --> 19:32.960
Wait!

19:32.960 --> 19:34.670
Don't hurt my friends.

19:34.670 --> 19:35.960
I'm just coming down to talk.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.420
I am Princess Elena.

19:40.420 --> 19:43.420
I am Jiku,
leader of the noblins.

19:43.420 --> 19:45.620
Jiku, I should've
asked before,

19:45.620 --> 19:47.750
but why are you taking
their ships?

19:47.750 --> 19:49.790
We are just trying
to get home.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.790
The old queen took us
and locked us up in your city

19:51.790 --> 19:53.000
for many years.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.710
Shuriki imprisoned
you

19:55.710 --> 19:59.540
Because we have
the golden touch.

19:59.540 --> 20:02.000
Shuriki forced us to turn
all sorts of things to gold

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
to make her rich.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.960
But then, one day,

20:05.960 --> 20:08.040
the bars of our prison
vanished.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.380
We were free.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.250
But we were so far from home,
in a strange city,

20:13.250 --> 20:15.920
and I had to get
my fellow noblins to safety.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.420
The ships were
the quickest way.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.750
I had no idea.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.250
The reason
you're all free

20:22.250 --> 20:24.380
is because Elena defeated
that evil queen.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.120
I had no idea.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.710
Well, now that we know
what's really going on,

20:29.710 --> 20:32.290
I have a royal decree
to make.

20:32.290 --> 20:35.750
Jiku, you can borrow
our ships to take you home,

20:35.750 --> 20:38.170
as long as
we get them back after.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

20:40.330 --> 20:43.500
Noblins, we're going home!

20:43.500 --> 20:44.750
Yeah! Finally,
Your Majesty.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.210
Speaking of home,
we should get going

20:52.210 --> 20:54.170
if we wanna make it back
in time for the ball.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.580
Right. The ball.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.960
And what was I
supposed to do?

20:57.960 --> 21:00.420
She just took off
on the jaquin.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.750
Look. It's Elena,
and Isabel!

21:02.750 --> 21:04.460
Abuela!

21:04.460 --> 21:07.120
I'm so glad
you're safe.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.120
Elena saved us.
She tracked down
the ships,

21:10.120 --> 21:12.040
and fought the noblins,

21:12.040 --> 21:14.330
but then she figured out
they weren't mean at all,

21:14.330 --> 21:16.620
and then she made a deal
to get them home safely...

21:16.620 --> 21:18.920
( Isabel continues
indistinctly )

21:21.210 --> 21:23.960
ARMANDO: Princess Elena
Castillo Flores,

21:23.960 --> 21:26.210
do you swear to protect
and defend

21:26.210 --> 21:28.580
the kingdom of Avalor?

21:31.960 --> 21:35.750
Um... before
I answer that,

21:35.750 --> 21:37.580
there's something
I'd like to say.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.540
Today, I set out to prove

21:39.540 --> 21:41.880
that I was ready
to be queen of Avalor,

21:41.880 --> 21:44.790
and I learned that
I have a lot to learn

21:44.790 --> 21:46.500
before I become queen.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.380
So with that in mind,

21:48.380 --> 21:51.000
I am ready to appoint
my Grand Council.

21:52.580 --> 21:55.000
Luisa, my grandmother,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.620
because you always
find a way

21:57.620 --> 21:59.580
to look on
the bright side of things,

21:59.580 --> 22:00.580
no matter how dark it gets.

22:04.420 --> 22:05.790
Naomi Turner.

22:05.790 --> 22:07.040
!

22:07.040 --> 22:09.170
Today you gave me
great advice,

22:09.170 --> 22:12.210
and wouldn't stop trying
to get me to take it.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.540
I could use your
common sense and resolve

22:14.540 --> 22:16.380
- on my council.
- I'm on the Grand Council.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.040
I am on
the Grand Council!

22:20.040 --> 22:21.670
That's my Naomi.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.420
Chancellor Esteban.

22:27.420 --> 22:29.670
You know so much
about the kingdom

22:29.670 --> 22:31.120
and everyone in it.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.460
I would be foolish
not to seek your expertise.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.210
Yes, this is true.

22:35.210 --> 22:39.960
And finally,
my grandfather, Francisco.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.670
The wisest person I know.

22:42.670 --> 22:45.500
Today, you acted like
a true queen.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.920
And one day, I hope to be.

22:47.920 --> 22:52.330
But today, I vow
to protect and defend

22:52.330 --> 22:55.670
the kingdom of Avalor
as Crown Princess.

23:03.620 --> 23:06.290
Uh, is it supposed
to do this?

23:06.290 --> 23:08.290
It's never glowed
like that before.

23:08.290 --> 23:11.580
MIGS: Ladies and gentlemen,
we have arrived!

23:11.580 --> 23:14.750
SKYLAR:
We're still invited, right?

23:16.580 --> 23:17.750
It is my honor to present

23:17.750 --> 23:21.830
Crown Princess Elena
of Avalor.

23:25.580 --> 23:27.830
Not bad for
your first day.

23:27.830 --> 23:30.330
But are you ready for
day two?

23:30.330 --> 23:32.670
Are you?

23:32.670 --> 23:35.210
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
