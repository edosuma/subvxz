WEBVTT

01:22.325 --> 01:24.327
Hurry up!
Everyone's on!

01:24.361 --> 01:25.694
Why can't I hear them?

01:25.728 --> 01:27.730
You have it on mute.

01:27.763 --> 01:29.366
Oh, yeah! Oops.

01:29.399 --> 01:31.001
- <i>Hey, guys!</i>
- Hi!

01:31.034 --> 01:32.169
- Hi!
- <i>Hey, guys!</i>

01:32.202 --> 01:33.303
<i>Hi!</i>

01:33.336 --> 01:34.703
Hi! Sorry,
technical difficulties.

01:34.737 --> 01:37.307
- <i>Yes, I have a question.</i>
- <i>How much does it cost?</i>

01:37.340 --> 01:39.242
One at a time.
We can't hear you.

01:39.276 --> 01:41.011
<i>I've got some college money
saved up.</i>

01:41.044 --> 01:43.113
- It's not that simple.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

01:43.146 --> 01:44.947
<i>Where do we even start?</i>

01:44.981 --> 01:46.049
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:46.083 --> 01:47.850
<i>Excuse me!</i>

01:47.883 --> 01:49.219
Yes. You, sir.

01:49.252 --> 01:50.820
<i>I don't have any money,</i>

01:50.853 --> 01:54.091
<i>but if you make my mom
and daddy love each other,</i>

01:54.124 --> 01:56.159
<i>I'll give you this.</i>

01:56.193 --> 01:57.626
<i>Aw!</i>

01:57.660 --> 01:59.096
That's very sweet of you,

01:59.129 --> 02:02.199
but we're not here to take
your money or your teddy bear.

02:02.232 --> 02:04.834
We're here to create a
safe place to share stories

02:04.867 --> 02:06.103
and support one another.

02:06.136 --> 02:07.970
<i>Oh, okay, I get it now.</i>

02:08.004 --> 02:10.373
<i>Will you tell us
your story?</i>

02:10.407 --> 02:12.842
<i>Oh, yeah,
that's a great idea.</i>

02:12.875 --> 02:16.745
Okay, but it's a really,
really long story.

02:21.418 --> 02:23.120
Looks like
we have some time.

02:23.153 --> 02:24.720
Uncle Paul's
still sleeping.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.289
So, where should we start?

02:26.323 --> 02:29.226
Ooh, ooh! Remember Dad
in that funny robe?

02:29.259 --> 02:30.726
No.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.229
We should start when
we were behind the bushes.

02:32.262 --> 02:35.432
Guys, the story's not about
all the crazy things we did.

02:35.465 --> 02:37.800
But it was really fun stuff.

02:37.833 --> 02:38.934
Yeah.

02:38.968 --> 02:41.404
Our story's about
faith, hope and love

02:41.438 --> 02:43.806
and how adults need to
be reminded what they had

02:43.839 --> 02:45.142
and what's still there.

02:45.175 --> 02:47.676
Let's go back, way back.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.912
<i>It was 1998.</i>

02:49.945 --> 02:53.150
<i>Wait, wait. Didn't
they have color TVs back then?</i>

02:53.183 --> 02:54.451
<i>Oh, yeah. You're right.</i>

02:54.484 --> 02:55.885
<i>Not that far back.</i>

02:55.918 --> 02:57.720
Let me know
if you need anything, okay?

02:57.753 --> 02:59.422
<i>Dad was working
his usual shift</i>

02:59.456 --> 03:01.291
<i>at the local Italian restaurant.</i>

03:01.324 --> 03:02.993
<i>He was the best waiter.</i>

03:03.026 --> 03:04.995
<i>He knew everybody's name.</i>

03:05.028 --> 03:08.365
<i>It was just another
Friday night until he met her.</i>

03:08.398 --> 03:09.899
Oh!

03:09.932 --> 03:11.168
Hey.

03:11.201 --> 03:14.337
<i>For the first time in his
life, he was speechless.</i>

03:14.371 --> 03:16.306
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

03:16.339 --> 03:17.740
My bad.

03:17.773 --> 03:19.176
<i>And that's
unusual for Dad.</i>

03:21.044 --> 03:23.480
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. Sorry.

03:23.513 --> 03:25.315
Can I take this table?

03:25.348 --> 03:26.882
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

03:26.916 --> 03:29.152
Hey, ladies. Welcome
to Tony's Bella Vista.

03:29.186 --> 03:32.955
My name is Brent, and I
will be taking care of you.

03:32.989 --> 03:36.226
<i>Mom said she had a
little crush on Dad right away.</i>

03:36.259 --> 03:37.494
I mean I'll be serving you.

03:38.861 --> 03:40.130
<i>He was pretty funny too.</i>

03:40.163 --> 03:43.166
Here, do you know
what you'd like to order?

03:45.135 --> 03:49.039
<i>They both knew something
special was happening that night.</i>

03:51.208 --> 03:52.242
Bye.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.212
<i>Mom could feel it.</i>

03:55.245 --> 03:57.080
<i>I'm pretty sure that's
why she stuck around</i>

03:57.113 --> 03:58.481
<i>for a little while.</i>

03:58.515 --> 04:00.749
Uh, save me a bite?

04:00.783 --> 04:04.787
Yeah? Okay, cool.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.363
<i>They talked
and laughed all night.</i>

04:13.396 --> 04:16.333
<i>Mom had a smile
that could light up a room.</i>

04:16.366 --> 04:20.237
<i>Dad even got a little
mushy and drew a picture for her.</i>

04:31.847 --> 04:34.351
<i>It truly was
love at first sight.</i>

04:37.120 --> 04:39.155
<i>They got married
right away.</i>

04:40.290 --> 04:41.857
<i>Bought a new house.</i>

04:41.890 --> 04:46.029
<i>And we started
showing up one by one.</i>

04:49.332 --> 04:51.800
<i>Yeah, that's me in the belly.</i>

04:56.339 --> 04:58.541
<i>That's me as a baby.</i>

04:58.575 --> 05:00.909
<i>Aren't I so cute?</i>

05:03.846 --> 05:05.848
<i>They were so happy.</i>

05:07.350 --> 05:09.252
<i>We were so happy.</i>

05:11.887 --> 05:15.158
<i>But time changes everything.</i>

05:19.396 --> 05:21.298
Izzy!
Go get the bread.

05:21.331 --> 05:22.332
Oh, my gosh!

05:31.207 --> 05:32.108
Are you guys done yet?

05:32.142 --> 05:34.877
Do you have the drinks?
Or the napkins?

05:34.910 --> 05:36.613
We got this, sis.

05:36.646 --> 05:39.215
What am I forgetting?
Oh, yeah! Sauce.

05:40.550 --> 05:41.985
So pretty!

05:42.018 --> 05:44.087
It's all
in the details.

05:46.489 --> 05:48.358
Wait, you gotta
get the waters.

05:48.391 --> 05:51.127
We have to hurry.
Mom's gonna be here any minute.

05:51.161 --> 05:52.861
Is Dad gonna show
this time?

05:52.895 --> 05:54.197
Yes.

05:54.230 --> 05:56.466
- I hope this works out.
- Stop worrying.

05:56.499 --> 05:58.201
It will.

05:58.234 --> 06:01.271
Izzy! You got sauce
all over the plates!

06:01.304 --> 06:04.107
Oh, brother!
It doesn't have to be perfect.

06:04.140 --> 06:07.477
Said it once,
I've said it a million times.

06:07.510 --> 06:08.978
- It's all in the...
- Details.

06:09.012 --> 06:11.214
Aw.
It's perfect, Ruby.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.349
They'll love it.

06:13.983 --> 06:15.951
Mom's here.
Andrew, did you set up the monitor?

06:15.985 --> 06:17.087
I forgot.

06:18.655 --> 06:19.888
Daddy!

06:19.922 --> 06:21.191
Ruby, go stand
by the door,

06:21.224 --> 06:23.159
but don't let Dad in
until I tell you to.

06:23.193 --> 06:25.495
Andrew, move it!
We need some serious intel tonight.

06:25.528 --> 06:26.663
Right on it.

06:28.398 --> 06:30.400
Wow.
What smells so good?

06:31.934 --> 06:33.936
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey!

06:33.969 --> 06:36.106
- You're here early.
- You cooked dinner?

06:36.139 --> 06:39.075
Yes. I threw together
my famous lasagna.

06:39.109 --> 06:42.545
You are so amazing,
sweetheart.

06:42.579 --> 06:44.647
Oh, you take
such good care of us.

06:44.681 --> 06:46.249
It's the least
I could do.

06:46.282 --> 06:48.917
I know that you have
a lot on your mind.

06:51.421 --> 06:53.390
I wonder
who that can be.

06:53.423 --> 06:54.923
I'll go get it.

07:00.363 --> 07:02.031
Okay.

07:02.065 --> 07:04.134
Okay! Open the door.

07:04.167 --> 07:06.469
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey.

07:06.503 --> 07:08.171
Surprise!

07:09.639 --> 07:11.074
What?

07:11.107 --> 07:11.974
What?

07:12.008 --> 07:15.145
Yeah, what? Uh, what
are you guys up to?

07:15.178 --> 07:17.547
We thought it'd be nice for all
of us to have dinner together.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.082
Like a family.

07:19.115 --> 07:21.117
Well,
that would be up to your mom.

07:27.457 --> 07:31.261
Yes, of course.
I mean, we're still a family.

07:31.294 --> 07:32.495
Great! Let's eat.

07:52.182 --> 07:54.451
Izzy, great job
with dinner.

07:54.484 --> 07:57.020
Thanks, Dad.
You want more?

07:57.053 --> 07:59.955
No. No, I'm full.
Thank you, sweetheart.

08:03.226 --> 08:05.128
When's your first
baseball game?

08:05.161 --> 08:07.564
Don't know.
Thinking about quitting the team.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.335
That's a pretty rose.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.603
Ruby did that.

08:13.636 --> 08:16.005
Details, Mom.

08:16.039 --> 08:19.509
I remember when your father
remembered those details.

08:23.112 --> 08:24.481
Who wants dessert?

08:24.514 --> 08:25.648
- I do!
- I do!

08:35.558 --> 08:36.759
Who has dessert
on the porch?

08:36.793 --> 08:38.628
It was an awkward moment.
I just panicked.

08:38.661 --> 08:40.663
Come on, guys.
Listen to the monitor.

08:40.697 --> 08:42.565
Shh, listen.

08:42.599 --> 08:43.766
<i>The kids seem all right.</i>

08:43.800 --> 08:45.502
Seriously?

08:45.535 --> 08:48.071
Can't you see how hard
this has been on them?

08:48.104 --> 08:49.772
Look at all this trouble
that they went to

08:49.806 --> 08:52.709
just for us to have
a family dinner together.

08:52.742 --> 08:58.381
Yeah, and we just had a very
nice family dinner together.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.649
What did he say?

08:59.682 --> 09:01.284
Shh, shh, shh.
I can't hear.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.522
Nothing seemed odd.

09:05.555 --> 09:07.323
It didn't seem odd?

09:07.357 --> 09:08.558
Are you kidding?

09:12.262 --> 09:14.797
They've just been acting
so strange lately.

09:14.831 --> 09:17.133
I just think that they know.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.068
Yeah, of course
they know.

09:19.102 --> 09:22.071
What?
Did you say something?

09:22.105 --> 09:23.239
What do we know?

09:23.273 --> 09:25.208
This isn't going well.

09:26.342 --> 09:27.443
Brent?

09:28.545 --> 09:29.579
No. What?

09:31.381 --> 09:33.816
Did you say something
to the kids about us?

09:33.850 --> 09:35.852
No! Of course not.

09:35.885 --> 09:39.088
I don't know where your head is right
now, but you're definitely not present.

09:39.122 --> 09:40.690
I'm sorry.

09:40.723 --> 09:44.093
It's... It's the office.
I gotta get back to my place.

09:44.127 --> 09:47.797
You know what? We agreed that no
matter what happens with our marriage,

09:47.830 --> 09:49.832
we would keep
this family together.

09:49.866 --> 09:52.435
Sarah, I know that,
and I'm sorry. Okay?

09:52.468 --> 09:55.138
Chelsea called an emergency
meeting for tomorrow,

09:55.171 --> 09:56.573
and there's a lot riding
on this Allied deal.

09:56.606 --> 09:59.676
You promised the kids that you would
take them to the movie tomorrow.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.144
I know that.

10:01.177 --> 10:03.446
And I'll do my best
to get here by noon.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.782
Do you even know
what your best is?

10:05.815 --> 10:08.518
Nice.

10:15.625 --> 10:20.196
What do we know?
What don't we know?

10:20.229 --> 10:23.833
We know in one week, Mom and Dad
will have been separated for a year.

10:23.866 --> 10:25.468
Maybe they are
getting a divorce.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.736
Andrew, stop!

10:26.769 --> 10:28.605
We don't know that for sure.

10:28.638 --> 10:32.208
Let's just have faith,
and everything will work out.

10:36.212 --> 10:39.248
Mommies and daddies
should stay together.

10:39.916 --> 10:41.351
Yeah.

10:41.384 --> 10:43.486
We've got
nothing to worry about.

10:50.660 --> 10:53.529
Come on, guys. How many times
do we have to go over this?

10:53.563 --> 10:55.264
It's obvious.

10:55.298 --> 10:57.667
We've had radio silence from
Allied for the past two weeks,

10:57.700 --> 11:00.503
which can only mean one thing.

11:00.536 --> 11:01.504
Calloway?

11:01.537 --> 11:03.873
Um, it's not good?

11:03.906 --> 11:05.408
Wrong answer!

11:05.441 --> 11:08.945
It means someone else
is courting Harlan.

11:13.616 --> 11:17.854
I need you to find out who is
trying to steal this deal from us!

11:17.887 --> 11:19.489
Right.
Right, right, right.

11:19.522 --> 11:21.624
Find out who's
the other company. Okay.

11:32.702 --> 11:35.338
All right, let's go.
I'm going to take you to the movies.

11:35.371 --> 11:37.206
But I thought Dad
was taking us.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.709
Come on! Let's go.
You're gonna miss the previews.

11:42.311 --> 11:43.946
Right, right.

11:43.981 --> 11:46.282
Find out who's
the other company.

11:46.315 --> 11:47.817
I'm on it.
We're on it.

11:47.850 --> 11:49.719
Brent's on it.
Right, Brent?

11:52.722 --> 11:54.290
On it. Yes.

11:54.323 --> 11:57.260
Would you like a more
quiet place to text, Lambert?

11:57.293 --> 12:00.329
Oh. Yeah, sorry
about that, Chelsea.

12:00.363 --> 12:03.433
We're about to lose
$13 million in commission.

12:03.466 --> 12:05.435
Sorry just
isn't good enough.

12:05.468 --> 12:09.439
Find out who is playing in
our sandbox and squash them.

12:09.472 --> 12:12.542
Absolutely.
We will get it done.

12:14.877 --> 12:18.314
I mean, what's up with all the texts, man?
You was leaving me hanging here.

12:18.347 --> 12:21.284
- Come on, guy.
- I'm sorry about that, Cal. It's Sarah.

12:21.317 --> 12:23.686
I think we're done.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.722
I'm sorry, man.

12:25.755 --> 12:28.524
You guys been separated
for, what, like a year?

12:29.492 --> 12:30.460
Yep.

12:30.493 --> 12:31.995
It's kind of
a long time, man.

12:32.029 --> 12:35.331
Can't say you didn't try.
You tried, right?

12:36.499 --> 12:37.734
I think so.

12:42.039 --> 12:43.506
My turn!

12:44.074 --> 12:46.642
Ooh!

12:48.045 --> 12:50.346
- Ooh!
- Nice!

12:50.379 --> 12:53.382
Sorry about today.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.753
Yeah, I know.

12:56.786 --> 12:58.354
It's always something.

13:02.092 --> 13:04.460
So, we go to court
in a couple of days?

13:06.063 --> 13:07.797
Yeah.

13:09.032 --> 13:10.767
I guess this is it,
then.

13:14.071 --> 13:15.538
I guess.

13:19.342 --> 13:20.676
I didn't want this.

13:21.611 --> 13:24.380
I don't think you know
what you want, Brent.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.516
Oh, okay, all right.
I get it.

13:26.549 --> 13:28.918
It's all my fault.
I own it.

13:28.951 --> 13:33.756
That's not what I said. It's just your
priorities aren't in order, that's for sure.

13:33.790 --> 13:36.859
Maybe we should just do
what I came here to do.

13:44.934 --> 13:46.669
Okay, you go.

13:46.702 --> 13:47.937
- Oh!
- Oh!

13:47.970 --> 13:50.339
Oh, my God!

13:50.373 --> 13:52.575
Can you stop playing
for a second?

13:54.610 --> 13:58.714
Your mom and I have something that we...
we need to tell you.

13:59.582 --> 14:03.719
Sometimes,
for parents to...

14:03.753 --> 14:06.455
Be better parents...

14:07.890 --> 14:09.625
- they need to...
- Get a divorce.

14:11.028 --> 14:12.495
Andrew.

14:12.528 --> 14:14.463
Isn't that what
you're about to say?

14:14.931 --> 14:17.533
Yes.

14:18.068 --> 14:20.103
But we want you to know

14:20.137 --> 14:24.007
that we are still gonna
be a family, okay?

14:24.041 --> 14:26.442
Yeah, and that we
love you very much.

14:26.475 --> 14:28.544
And we love you too.

14:28.578 --> 14:30.446
But your divorce
has a direct impact

14:30.479 --> 14:32.481
on our personal
and emotional well-being,

14:32.515 --> 14:34.884
so we can't allow this
to happen.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.988
We'll discuss our next course
of action and get back to you.

14:38.021 --> 14:39.056
Thank you.

14:39.089 --> 14:40.556
What she said.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.860
Ditto.

14:48.731 --> 14:51.168
What do you mean,
"We'll discuss our next course of action"?

14:51.201 --> 14:53.636
I mean, we're not gonna
let this happen.

14:54.637 --> 14:56.772
Oh, boy. You got that
crazy look in your eye.

14:56.806 --> 14:58.141
What are we gonna do?

14:58.175 --> 15:00.910
Look, I still believe Mom
and Dad love each other.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.880
So, we need to take matters
into our own hands.

15:03.913 --> 15:06.682
And I know the perfect
person who can help.

15:10.187 --> 15:12.022
Come on, let's go!

15:16.525 --> 15:18.928
- I think it's this way.
- Yeah.

15:20.197 --> 15:22.765
- Remember to look for cars!
- Yeah.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.800
Guys, wait up!

15:51.827 --> 15:53.130
Come on, Ruby.

15:54.730 --> 15:57.433
It's so far up the hill.

15:59.702 --> 16:01.238
Come on, guys!

16:01.271 --> 16:03.073
Cross your fingers.

16:12.782 --> 16:14.717
Hi, Uncle Paul!

16:15.218 --> 16:16.585
Oh. Hey, guys!

16:16.619 --> 16:18.554
Whoa.
What happened to you?

16:18.587 --> 16:19.956
Oh, it was nothing.

16:19.990 --> 16:23.759
I was just cutting a tree down
the other day, and I fell.

16:23.793 --> 16:25.162
Down that hill?

16:27.130 --> 16:29.565
Yeah. Yeah,
down that hill.

16:29.598 --> 16:32.169
But it's okay.
I landed on my feet.

16:32.202 --> 16:33.236
Ow!

16:33.270 --> 16:35.705
Looks like he landed
on his face.

16:35.738 --> 16:36.839
Oh!

16:36.872 --> 16:40.177
You know, Uncle Paul,
maybe you need help around here.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.744
No.

16:41.777 --> 16:43.246
It's nothing a little ice
won't take care of.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.848
- Maybe you should sit down for a minute.
- Oh!

16:45.881 --> 16:48.584
Ruby, go get an ice pack
for Uncle Paul.

16:48.617 --> 16:49.952
- Good idea.
- Come on.

16:49.987 --> 16:51.687
Okay. Let's go.
All right.

16:52.755 --> 16:54.857
Ooh. Ah.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.126
Ow.

16:56.159 --> 16:57.860
Okay, whew.

16:59.029 --> 17:01.697
Look, I know you guys didn't
come all the way over here

17:01.731 --> 17:03.000
to take care
of this old fella,

17:03.033 --> 17:05.235
so I can tell something's
bothering you.

17:05.268 --> 17:07.670
Well, it's kind
of a long story.

17:07.703 --> 17:10.606
Our parents are getting a
divorce, and we need your help.

17:10.639 --> 17:12.009
Well, that pretty much
sums it up.

17:12.042 --> 17:14.877
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, guys.
Really, I am.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.613
Look, I know you're a little
young to understand this,

17:17.646 --> 17:20.916
but relationships
are complicated.

17:20.950 --> 17:23.153
Your parents have been
dealing with this for a while,

17:23.186 --> 17:24.820
and there's only
so much I can do.

17:24.854 --> 17:26.889
They need to be willing
to do the work.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.059
Clearly they're not
working hard enough.

17:30.127 --> 17:31.794
Well.

17:31.827 --> 17:32.895
Here you go!

17:32.928 --> 17:34.097
Oh.

17:34.131 --> 17:35.898
Goodness.

17:35.931 --> 17:39.735
Let's move this down to my feet,
and I got something for you.

17:39.769 --> 17:42.638
Uncle Paul, focus.
We need serious help.

17:42.671 --> 17:44.640
Well, patience, child.
Okay.

17:44.673 --> 17:46.909
Can we pray or something?
Isn't that what pastors do?

17:46.942 --> 17:49.645
I can pray, you can pray,
and your parents can pray.

17:49.678 --> 17:52.182
Okay, which one?
That one for you, and that for you.

17:52.215 --> 17:53.916
And so what we're gonna do,

17:53.949 --> 17:56.685
take this string,
and you're gonna hold it really tight.

17:56.719 --> 17:58.255
Hold it tight,
hold it tight.

17:58.288 --> 18:00.157
And you're going to pull
and just like that.

18:00.190 --> 18:01.590
Not very strong.
Right?

18:01.624 --> 18:02.858
And then we go to
the purple one.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.194
Watch the purple one.
Watch.

18:04.227 --> 18:05.661
There's a little string
right here,

18:05.694 --> 18:06.896
and you're gonna hold this
really tight.

18:06.929 --> 18:09.266
Yep, yep. Really tight.
So beautiful.

18:09.299 --> 18:11.001
Oh, my goodness.
Look.

18:11.034 --> 18:13.203
And then we're gonna twist it
together with this green one,

18:13.236 --> 18:14.904
and you're gonna
hold it tight,

18:14.937 --> 18:17.207
and look, it's a little stronger.
Pull, pull, pull.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.808
You can't get it.

18:18.841 --> 18:20.609
Oh, my goodness, that was strong.
Wasn't it?

18:20.643 --> 18:21.844
But it still
comes undone.

18:21.877 --> 18:23.813
And now, let's go
to the gold one.

18:23.846 --> 18:25.948
And when we take
three strings,

18:25.982 --> 18:28.085
we're gonna twist
that together,

18:28.118 --> 18:31.354
and it all of a sudden
becomes a lot stronger.

18:31.388 --> 18:35.092
And so that's what happens
when you put God

18:35.125 --> 18:36.725
in the center
of a marriage.

18:36.759 --> 18:38.928
It becomes
that much stronger.

18:38.961 --> 18:41.231
That's what'll happen
if our parents pray?

18:41.264 --> 18:42.698
It's a start.

18:42.731 --> 18:44.800
But they're going to court
in two days.

18:45.968 --> 18:49.772
Listen, I think what your
parents need is time.

18:49.805 --> 18:51.807
And I've got a buddy
that owes me a favor,

18:51.841 --> 18:55.045
and I think that he can
help give your parents

18:55.078 --> 18:56.346
the time
that they need.

18:56.379 --> 18:58.181
Is this person
a pastor like you?

18:58.215 --> 19:01.784
Well, not exactly.

19:02.885 --> 19:03.853
Hi!

19:03.886 --> 19:05.255
I'm Donovan Marshall.

19:05.288 --> 19:06.822
Call me now!

19:10.193 --> 19:13.796
There's a new marshal in town,
and he's collecting.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.003
Don't be shortchanged!

19:20.036 --> 19:21.171
Pew!

19:23.939 --> 19:25.674
You have outdone yourself.

19:25.708 --> 19:27.743
Seriously,
this is a game changer!

19:27.776 --> 19:30.247
I love the line,
"There's a new marshal in town!"

19:30.280 --> 19:32.215
Pew, pew, pew!

19:32.249 --> 19:33.383
Yeah. Yeah!

19:33.416 --> 19:35.385
Yeah, put it all over
social media.

19:35.418 --> 19:36.987
We can't afford that!

19:38.255 --> 19:39.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:39.722 --> 19:42.292
Uh, you know, Facebook,
Tweeter, Instacart.

19:42.325 --> 19:43.692
Instagram!

19:43.726 --> 19:45.629
He knows what
I'm talking about!

19:46.396 --> 19:48.165
You know what I'm
talking about, right?

19:48.198 --> 19:49.266
Okay, great!

19:49.299 --> 19:50.766
This is awesome.
Seriously.

19:50.799 --> 19:52.369
Move over, Spielberg.

19:52.402 --> 19:54.004
All right.
Talk to you later.

19:54.037 --> 19:56.206
Come on!
This is the place.

19:56.239 --> 19:57.840
Are you sure?

19:57.873 --> 19:59.808
Yes, I'm sure.

20:00.876 --> 20:03.846
I'm so excited,
but I hope everything goes well.

20:05.982 --> 20:07.017
Come on.

20:08.985 --> 20:09.818
Come on, Ruby.

20:13.889 --> 20:15.758
We can't afford
those commercials.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.793
We can't even afford
this office.

20:17.826 --> 20:20.763
We were perfectly fine
in my father's garage.

20:20.796 --> 20:22.332
You're not thinking
big enough.

20:22.365 --> 20:24.301
This is gonna get
my name out there.

20:24.334 --> 20:27.003
They're gonna come knocking at my door!

20:27.037 --> 20:29.805
Wow. That was fast.

20:29.838 --> 20:31.441
<i>♪ There's a new marshal
In town ♪</i>

20:31.474 --> 20:32.509
<i>♪ Collecting for you ♪</i>

20:32.542 --> 20:33.842
Mark my word!

20:33.876 --> 20:35.345
You're gonna
be broke so soon,

20:35.378 --> 20:37.414
and we will be back
in my padre's casa!

20:37.447 --> 20:40.016
Shh!

20:41.917 --> 20:42.818
Hi!

20:42.851 --> 20:44.087
Are you
Donovan Marshall?

20:44.120 --> 20:45.222
- Yes!
- Great!

20:45.255 --> 20:46.489
A good friend
sent us.

20:46.523 --> 20:49.792
Wait. Oh, boy.

20:49.825 --> 20:52.395
Aw!

20:52.429 --> 20:55.265
You guys are so cute!
Aw!

20:55.298 --> 20:56.966
Can I get you
anything to drink?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.369
- Yes, please!
- Oh, well, that's not necessary.

20:59.402 --> 21:02.372
They're not staying
very much longer.

21:02.405 --> 21:04.441
Professional.
What are you doing?

21:04.474 --> 21:06.076
Okay, kids.

21:06.109 --> 21:08.545
I'm afraid I don't have
any lollipops.

21:08.578 --> 21:09.845
We're not here
for candy.

21:09.878 --> 21:11.014
We need a lawyer.

21:11.047 --> 21:13.183
Look, I'm a personal
injury attorney.

21:13.216 --> 21:16.386
I work with people who've actually
been injured somehow, so...

21:16.419 --> 21:18.521
But we have been injured!
And hurt!

21:18.555 --> 21:21.358
Yes! Now we're talking.

21:22.559 --> 21:24.427
I mean,
how unfortunate.

21:24.461 --> 21:26.129
Our parents
are getting a divorce.

21:26.162 --> 21:27.530
It's gonna mess
everything up.

21:27.564 --> 21:29.532
It hurts our feelings.

21:29.566 --> 21:32.535
I'm not following here.
Sorry.

21:32.569 --> 21:34.137
- You're a lawyer, right?
- Yes.

21:34.170 --> 21:36.072
We want you to sue them
or something.

21:37.107 --> 21:39.009
Make it so they
can't get a divorce,

21:39.042 --> 21:41.278
or at least
not right away.

21:41.311 --> 21:42.345
They need time.

21:42.379 --> 21:43.912
Time for what?

21:43.946 --> 21:45.482
For our parents
to figure it out.

21:45.515 --> 21:48.485
So they can start praying
for each other.

21:48.518 --> 21:52.122
Oh! You want me to intervene
in an ongoing court proceedings

21:52.155 --> 21:55.292
and file an injunction, thus
delaying your parents' divorce.

21:55.325 --> 21:56.526
Yes! Can you do it?

21:56.559 --> 21:58.461
Not a chance.

21:58.495 --> 21:59.529
But why?

21:59.562 --> 22:01.197
One, I don't do divorces.

22:01.231 --> 22:03.033
Two, what you're asking
will probably get me disbarred.

22:03.066 --> 22:04.567
And three,
most important,

22:04.601 --> 22:06.935
no one in this scenario
has any money.

22:06.969 --> 22:09.172
- No! No, please.
- Really, no, please.

22:09.205 --> 22:10.906
- No.
- My watch is worth a pretty penny.

22:10.939 --> 22:12.309
No, it's not, really.

22:12.342 --> 22:15.312
- Out. Let's go, let's go.
- Thanks for nothing!

22:15.345 --> 22:16.546
- Come on, Ruby.
- Ooh, okay!

22:16.579 --> 22:19.449
And thank you too!
All right.

22:19.482 --> 22:21.584
Ah, that's a feisty
little one.

22:21.618 --> 22:23.186
- Oh, excuse me.
- Mm-mmm.

22:23.219 --> 22:25.021
- All right. I gotta...
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

22:25.055 --> 22:27.324
- What are you doing?
- You owe our friend a visit.

22:27.357 --> 22:28.325
Go. Just go.

22:28.358 --> 22:29.326
Go, go, go.

22:29.359 --> 22:31.127
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you do.

22:31.894 --> 22:34.497
Go.

22:34.531 --> 22:36.099
This will be good for you!

22:36.132 --> 22:38.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:52.248 --> 22:54.850
That was a neat trick
you pulled today.

22:55.518 --> 22:57.520
Hey, Donovan,
old buddy, old pal.

22:57.554 --> 22:58.921
Long time, no see.

22:58.954 --> 23:01.091
Don't "old buddy, old pal"
me, okay?

23:01.124 --> 23:03.493
You're meddling again,
and I'm not biting.

23:03.526 --> 23:05.428
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:06.663 --> 23:09.432
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

23:09.466 --> 23:12.135
You know, you can use zip
ties to hang this, right?

23:12.168 --> 23:15.071
I think duct tape
works just the same.

23:17.273 --> 23:18.308
Clearly.

23:22.312 --> 23:26.149
Look, this is a chance for
you to help the helpless.

23:26.182 --> 23:28.551
I mean, don't you already
say that in your commercials?

23:28.585 --> 23:30.987
Yeah, I already
do that. Okay?

23:31.020 --> 23:33.656
"I've collected millions
on their behalf."

23:33.690 --> 23:34.991
I bet you have.

23:35.024 --> 23:36.126
I know.

23:36.159 --> 23:37.926
This is different.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.195
Well, you met the kids.

23:39.229 --> 23:42.298
You see how the idea
of divorce affects them.

23:43.099 --> 23:45.502
You're still trying
to save the world.

23:45.535 --> 23:47.170
Nah, just my family.

23:48.638 --> 23:50.273
So what do you need me for?

23:50.306 --> 23:52.675
If you want to help them,
why don't you just help them?

23:52.709 --> 23:54.444
It's not that easy.

23:54.477 --> 23:57.680
My sister is not so inclined to
get help from her big brother.

23:57.714 --> 24:01.050
Look, come on.
Help an old buddy, old pal out.

24:01.084 --> 24:02.452
Paul, have you ever
heard of no fault?

24:02.485 --> 24:05.288
I mean, courts can't force
people to stay married.

24:05.321 --> 24:07.357
Yeah, no fault is
unilateral divorce.

24:07.390 --> 24:12.328
It's when one spouse acting alone
forces the other into a divorce.

24:13.463 --> 24:15.165
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:16.132 --> 24:18.468
All right. No promises.

24:18.501 --> 24:20.103
I'll look into it.

24:20.136 --> 24:22.005
This'll be good for you.

24:23.606 --> 24:25.442
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

24:27.243 --> 24:29.379
Uh, Paul, do you need
any help here?

24:29.412 --> 24:32.582
No, I got it.
It's not my first rodeo.

24:32.615 --> 24:34.150
Okeydoke.

24:35.018 --> 24:37.187
I'm gonna
remind you again.

24:37.220 --> 24:41.157
You're entitled to considerably
much more than you're asking for.

24:41.191 --> 24:44.360
Well, I just thought it was fair
for the both of us.

24:45.328 --> 24:46.362
Fair?

24:46.396 --> 24:49.466
If fair's all you want,
then why did you hire me?

24:49.499 --> 24:52.035
Who has Mr. Lambert
retained?

24:52.502 --> 24:54.070
Well, I think my husband...

24:54.103 --> 24:55.472
Okay. Right there.

24:55.505 --> 24:58.141
Don't think of him
as your husband ever again.

24:58.174 --> 25:01.277
From this day forward,
he is the defendant.

25:01.711 --> 25:03.112
Okay.

25:03.646 --> 25:07.217
I think Brent,
the defendant,

25:07.250 --> 25:11.287
hired an old college friend,
Hayden Grimes.

25:12.322 --> 25:15.225
He was actually best man
at our wedding.

25:15.258 --> 25:16.593
Grimes?

25:16.626 --> 25:18.561
That guy is...

25:18.595 --> 25:19.963
<i>Evil.</i>

25:20.363 --> 25:22.098
Claire Hudgens.

25:22.131 --> 25:23.633
That woman
is black-hearted.

25:23.666 --> 25:28.505
I don't know what you did to
Sarah, but if she hired Claire,

25:28.538 --> 25:30.106
it must have been
pretty bad.

25:30.139 --> 25:31.474
Grimes.
It's not like that at all.

25:31.508 --> 25:35.712
I mean, I think Sarah knows her
from a book club or something.

25:35.745 --> 25:38.815
Women getting together and talking, it's bad news.

25:38.848 --> 25:40.283
It's bad news for men.

25:40.316 --> 25:41.718
You are funny, man.
It's not like that.

25:41.751 --> 25:43.152
It's Sarah!

25:43.186 --> 25:44.754
We're, we're great.
It's fine.

25:44.787 --> 25:46.322
I'm not overreacting.

25:46.356 --> 25:49.325
Listen, buddy, I've been
doing this a long time,

25:49.359 --> 25:51.661
and I am telling you
as a friend,

25:51.694 --> 25:53.129
you are gonna have
to toughen up,

25:53.162 --> 25:55.198
or she's gonna
eat you alive.

25:56.232 --> 25:59.435
- You know why divorces are so expensive?
- No.

26:00.303 --> 26:02.539
Because they're worth it.

26:02.572 --> 26:03.540
- Huh?
- Okay.

26:03.573 --> 26:05.375
Come on, bring it in!

26:05.408 --> 26:07.844
- All right.
- Don't forget the check.

26:07.877 --> 26:10.613
Okay.
What a friend!

26:11.481 --> 26:13.116
So what's gonna happen?

26:13.149 --> 26:15.818
Two houses,
two bedrooms,

26:15.852 --> 26:17.253
two sets of clothes.

26:17.287 --> 26:19.322
One here,
and one with Dad.

26:19.355 --> 26:20.757
I can't sleep.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.592
It's okay.
None of us can.

26:22.625 --> 26:23.826
It's going to be fine.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.628
Everyone gets divorced
these days.

26:36.873 --> 26:38.641
- Bianca!
- What?

26:39.742 --> 26:41.244
Bianca!

26:41.277 --> 26:41.844
What?

26:41.878 --> 26:44.480
Got the most amazing idea.

26:44.514 --> 26:47.450
- You're getting us a coffeemaker?
- No, I'm good.

26:47.483 --> 26:50.186
How much money do you think I
spend on my television commercials?

26:50.219 --> 26:52.155
- Mmm...
- Exactly! A ton.

26:52.188 --> 26:53.656
- But where's it get me?
- Actually...

26:53.690 --> 26:55.858
Exactly. Nowhere.

26:55.892 --> 26:57.894
I'm sorry, I got lost
in "amazing idea."

26:57.927 --> 27:01.264
Could you imagine the free publicity
I'll get representing these kids?

27:01.297 --> 27:03.600
Call the newspapers.
Call the radio station!

27:03.633 --> 27:06.736
I think you're missing
the bigger picture here.

27:06.769 --> 27:08.404
You're right.

27:08.438 --> 27:11.841
Forget about the newspapers.
Call the television stations!

27:11.874 --> 27:13.242
What about the clients?

27:13.276 --> 27:14.877
- Who?
- The children.

27:14.911 --> 27:17.146
Yeah. Call them too.

27:20.450 --> 27:23.219
If Dale eats one half
of a cookie,

27:23.252 --> 27:25.722
and Billy eats another
half of a cookie,

27:25.755 --> 27:27.790
how many cookies
are left?

27:27.824 --> 27:30.193
Easy! Two cookies.

27:30.226 --> 27:31.761
Uh, it's one cookie.

27:31.794 --> 27:33.563
Two halves
make one whole.

27:33.596 --> 27:37.533
No, but it's not a real cookie,
so it would just fall apart.

27:38.668 --> 27:39.769
You make a good point.

27:39.802 --> 27:42.271
Guys, you're not
gonna believe this.

27:42.305 --> 27:44.907
Mr. Marshall's
taking our case!

27:44.941 --> 27:47.510
- What does that mean?
- We have a lawyer!

27:47.543 --> 27:49.379
Yeah!

27:51.280 --> 27:52.515
What do we do now?

27:52.548 --> 27:55.385
I guess we just leave it
up to Mr. Marshall.

27:57.220 --> 27:59.455
Hey. Find anything yet?

27:59.489 --> 28:02.492
Yeah, I just found an article
on precision agriculture,

28:02.525 --> 28:04.560
and it mentions
Allied has patents

28:04.594 --> 28:07.797
for some of the top AG
automation technologies.

28:07.830 --> 28:09.632
You're brilliant, my friend.

28:09.666 --> 28:11.300
Huh? What is this?

28:12.602 --> 28:16.272
"AG Tech Expo & Conference,
featuring Chelsea Dwyer

28:16.305 --> 28:18.608
on the panel
of Feeding the World...

28:19.976 --> 28:21.911
an event series
focused on technologies

28:21.944 --> 28:24.781
transforming
the global food system."

28:26.249 --> 28:27.817
Tech influencer?

28:27.850 --> 28:31.421
What does that even mean?
I mean, this doesn't make any sense.

28:31.454 --> 28:33.790
She doesn't even know
how to use a printer.

28:33.823 --> 28:35.692
She's a IT Mother Teresa.

28:35.725 --> 28:36.959
- What?
- Yeah.

28:36.994 --> 28:38.728
What are you talking about?

28:38.761 --> 28:40.730
Do you really think that Chelsea's
the head of some charity?

28:40.763 --> 28:43.866
Yeah. Do you know she feeds
the homeless every weekend?

28:43.900 --> 28:46.703
She has a popular blog,
"Vegan Tech Talk."

28:46.736 --> 28:47.970
- What?
- Yeah. Really.

28:48.005 --> 28:50.707
Cal, are you stalking
our boss?

28:50.740 --> 28:53.342
I'm just saying.

28:55.445 --> 28:56.946
Oh, no.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.247
I have to go, Cal.

28:58.281 --> 28:59.582
Listen, I hate
doing this to you,

28:59.615 --> 29:02.285
but there's something
not right here.

29:02.318 --> 29:04.353
You mind digging
a little deeper for me?

29:04.387 --> 29:05.888
- Yeah. No problem, Brent.
- Okay.

29:05.922 --> 29:07.991
- Saving jobs, saving lives.
- All right.

29:08.025 --> 29:10.359
- Hey.
- Go away.

29:11.028 --> 29:12.996
Are you going
somewhere, Lambert?

29:13.030 --> 29:14.330
Um, I am.

29:14.363 --> 29:16.399
It's, um...
It's personal.

29:16.432 --> 29:18.768
But I got some good news.
I think we may have found something.

29:18.801 --> 29:21.804
I believe that the company may be an American tech company.

29:21.838 --> 29:24.340
- $13 million, Brent.
- Yes, I know.

29:24.373 --> 29:26.342
It's... It's my family.

29:26.375 --> 29:28.377
We're your family, Brent.

29:28.411 --> 29:30.847
An extended family
of 200 employees.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.583
Not to mention the shareholders
who are gonna want to blame someone

29:33.616 --> 29:35.618
if this thing goes sour.

29:35.651 --> 29:39.756
Whatever that is, handle it and
get your head back in the game.

29:39.789 --> 29:41.657
Yes, ma'am.
I'm going to be back later.

29:41.691 --> 29:44.527
I'm into it 100%. All right?
Whatever it takes.

30:01.444 --> 30:03.412
We may have a problem.

30:13.356 --> 30:14.992
I know, I know. I'm late.

30:15.025 --> 30:17.560
Sorry, sorry.

30:17.593 --> 30:20.530
Wow. Late for your own divorce hearing.
That is one for the books.

30:20.563 --> 30:22.398
Oh, it's my boss.
She's very demanding.

30:22.431 --> 30:23.933
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Your boss is a woman?

30:23.966 --> 30:25.601
- Yeah.
- Ah. Say no more.

30:25.635 --> 30:29.539
Is he always this late? I mean, this could
be an issue with alimony and child support.

30:29.572 --> 30:33.676
Well, he's usually on time,
but lately, I don't know.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.945
You're still
making excuses for him.

30:35.979 --> 30:37.613
Let me tell you
something about men.

30:37.647 --> 30:39.816
Women are process-oriented.

30:39.849 --> 30:43.820
It's not about the destination.
It's about the journey.

30:43.853 --> 30:45.555
Men are goal-oriented.

30:45.588 --> 30:48.558
For them, it's about completing the
task, checking it off

30:48.591 --> 30:50.127
and moving on
to the next thing.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.428
That's why they change
so much during marriage.

30:52.461 --> 30:55.598
You were once a goal, and
now, you've been checked off.

30:55.631 --> 30:58.601
All we want is to be done,
to be finished,

30:58.634 --> 31:00.536
to have all the work
behind us.

31:00.570 --> 31:02.105
But you're never done
with a woman.

31:02.139 --> 31:06.742
She resets at midnight.
You begin each day at zero, my friend.

31:09.146 --> 31:10.780
They're
complacent and lazy.

31:10.813 --> 31:12.983
They need us to tell them
what time to come home,

31:13.016 --> 31:16.719
whether their clothes match or
not, or if they like broccoli.

31:18.454 --> 31:20.623
No matter
how great a sacrifice,

31:20.656 --> 31:23.960
or what a wonderful husband you've
been over the last 20 years,

31:23.994 --> 31:25.428
none of that matters now.

31:25.461 --> 31:27.597
You may think you have
points from the past,

31:27.630 --> 31:31.467
but you would be a fool to
think you've accumulated any.

31:32.768 --> 31:33.936
All rise!

31:36.039 --> 31:38.608
The honorable Judge
Heavener presiding.

31:42.745 --> 31:43.779
Sit down.

31:47.150 --> 31:48.918
Both of you,
front and center.

31:54.891 --> 31:58.996
I thought I made it clear when I said I never
wanted to see the both of you together

31:59.029 --> 32:00.763
in my courtroom again.

32:00.796 --> 32:01.530
Yes, Judge.

32:01.564 --> 32:03.900
Imagine my shock
when I discovered

32:03.933 --> 32:07.070
that Ms. Hudgens here had agreed
to represent the plaintiff,

32:07.104 --> 32:08.738
- knowing very well...
- Your Honor.

32:08.771 --> 32:11.807
Mrs. Lambert... Sarah and I
are longtime acquaintances,

32:11.841 --> 32:15.678
and I can assure you that she retained
my services long before Mr. Grimes.

32:15.711 --> 32:17.914
I was Brent's best man.
Give me a break!

32:17.947 --> 32:21.051
Unless the defendant
is capable of precognition.

32:21.084 --> 32:22.785
Enough!

32:22.818 --> 32:26.156
One outburst,
one childish display,

32:26.189 --> 32:28.457
and I will find you both
in contempt.

32:29.192 --> 32:32.695
Now, sit down.

32:40.270 --> 32:44.041
- In the matter of the marriage of Brent A. Lambert...
- What's all that about?

32:44.074 --> 32:45.708
...and Sarah C. Lambert,

32:45.741 --> 32:48.211
we come to the preliminary
hearing before the state court.

32:48.245 --> 32:51.480
Are the parties and their
attorneys prepared to proceed?

32:51.514 --> 32:52.983
- Yes, Judge.
- Yes, Your Honor.

32:53.016 --> 32:55.952
Then by all means,
please do.

32:57.287 --> 33:00.856
Your Honor, this is a case
of a stay-at-home mom

33:00.890 --> 33:03.659
requesting the right
to continue to do so.

33:03.693 --> 33:05.228
- The defendant...
- I object!

33:05.262 --> 33:07.164
You can't object to
an opening statement.

33:07.197 --> 33:08.564
I object to your tone.

33:08.597 --> 33:09.832
My tone is no more on trial

33:09.865 --> 33:11.500
than your mismatched
shirt and tie.

33:11.534 --> 33:12.702
- So arrogant.
- Quiet!

33:12.735 --> 33:14.537
- You so drive me crazy!
- I'm arrogant?

33:14.570 --> 33:16.472
I will have order!

33:19.742 --> 33:21.144
Now, we are going
to proceed

33:21.178 --> 33:23.579
in an orderly
and professional manner

33:23.612 --> 33:26.882
as befits the respectful nature
of what we're doing.

33:29.618 --> 33:31.854
Your honor, my name
is Donovan Marshall,

33:31.887 --> 33:34.857
and I represent the children
of the litigants.

33:34.890 --> 33:38.028
I request permission
to be able to represent

33:38.061 --> 33:40.063
and sit in
on these hearings.

33:41.164 --> 33:43.599
- My kids hired an attorney?
- It's unlikely.

33:43.632 --> 33:46.602
It's clearly a tactic employed
by opposing counsel.

33:46.635 --> 33:50.107
I don't understand.
What do the kids have to do with this?

33:50.140 --> 33:53.976
Nothing. Children have no adversary
interest in a divorce action.

33:54.011 --> 33:56.946
This is an obvious ploy
to derail our proceedings.

33:56.980 --> 33:59.815
Would someone care to tell me
what's going on here?

33:59.849 --> 34:03.652
Your Honor, as unlikely
as it may seem,

34:03.686 --> 34:07.923
I can hardly agree that
the children have no interest.

34:07.957 --> 34:10.826
Why, half this petition
concerns itself

34:10.860 --> 34:16.599
with custody, visitation,
child support and schooling.

34:16.632 --> 34:20.636
And as such, I believe
children are entitled

34:20.669 --> 34:22.571
to representation.

34:31.081 --> 34:32.581
I've seen your commercials.

34:32.615 --> 34:34.985
- I know who you are.
- Yes, Judge.

34:35.018 --> 34:36.286
I don't like you.

34:36.319 --> 34:37.853
It's understandable.

34:37.887 --> 34:40.890
And I won't let you join
Moe and Curly over here

34:40.923 --> 34:44.061
and turn my courtroom
into a three-ring circus.

34:44.860 --> 34:46.629
Noted.

34:46.662 --> 34:48.664
Your Honor, it may
please you to know

34:48.697 --> 34:51.634
that I plan to navigate
the litigants

34:51.667 --> 34:55.771
out of your courtroom
and into family mediation.

34:56.173 --> 34:58.841
- Mediation?
- Yes.

34:58.874 --> 35:01.344
You mean to say,
if I let you sit in today,

35:01.378 --> 35:05.115
that the three of you
will just disappear?

35:05.148 --> 35:06.983
Well, that's the plan.

35:07.984 --> 35:09.052
Okay.

35:15.825 --> 35:18.361
This court will consider you
the guardian <i>ad litem</i>

35:18.395 --> 35:20.963
for the children of
Brent and Sarah Lambert.

35:20.997 --> 35:22.731
And as such,
you will be permitted

35:22.765 --> 35:25.168
to participate
in these proceedings.

35:25.202 --> 35:27.703
But let me remind you,
counsel,

35:27.736 --> 35:32.242
this courtroom is no place
for cheap Hollywood theatrics.

35:32.275 --> 35:34.311
Well,
of course, Your Honor.

35:34.344 --> 35:36.346
I have nothing but respect

35:36.379 --> 35:39.216
for the sanctity
of this courtroom

35:39.249 --> 35:42.052
and the judiciary process.

35:46.022 --> 35:47.857
Is it true you're
championing marriages

35:47.890 --> 35:49.692
by representing children
in divorce cases?

35:49.725 --> 35:51.760
Well,
you see, I collect...

35:51.794 --> 35:54.864
I fight for those who
cannot defend themselves.

35:54.897 --> 35:58.135
<i>Are you embarking on
a crusade to preserve families?</i>

35:58.168 --> 35:59.236
<i>Well, I...</i>

36:05.175 --> 36:06.376
Anything yet?

36:06.409 --> 36:10.147
No, maybe I'll
just text Bianca. Hi!

36:10.180 --> 36:12.415
Your mother and I
would like an explanation.

36:12.449 --> 36:14.783
We're not supposed
to discuss the case.

36:14.817 --> 36:16.919
That's not gonna cut it,
Izzy.

36:16.952 --> 36:18.021
Sit down.

36:25.428 --> 36:29.698
Your dad and I understand that
you are having some difficulties

36:29.732 --> 36:31.301
with what we're
going through.

36:31.334 --> 36:35.038
But what you guys did today,
that's not the way you handle it.

36:35.071 --> 36:35.871
What do you mean?

36:35.905 --> 36:38.041
- What do I mean?
- By hiring a lawyer!

36:38.074 --> 36:39.075
And going to court.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.311
That's not how families
deal with their problems.

36:41.344 --> 36:43.146
Isn't that what
you two are doing?

36:46.049 --> 36:49.785
Look, I didn't
want to get a divorce.

36:49.818 --> 36:52.122
- But your mother says that she's unhappy.
- What?

36:52.155 --> 36:55.192
- No, you're gonna blame me for this?
- No, no.

36:55.225 --> 36:57.994
You're not gonna take any
responsibility for this relationship?

36:58.028 --> 37:00.796
- I'm not blaming you. I'm just stating a fact.
- But you just did.

37:00.829 --> 37:02.798
You can't just say that
in front of our kids

37:02.831 --> 37:05.468
- and say that I'm the one that wanted a divorce.
- I'm not blaming you.

37:05.502 --> 37:07.437
- Yes, you...
- You said to me that you are unhappy.

37:07.470 --> 37:09.339
But we live
like roommates.

37:09.372 --> 37:12.275
- That's why we're getting...
- But did you or did you not tell me...

37:12.309 --> 37:15.011
Excuse me!

37:15.979 --> 37:17.813
We're still in the room!

37:18.381 --> 37:19.848
I'm sorry.

37:19.882 --> 37:21.251
That was wrong of us.

37:25.055 --> 37:26.223
I'm sorry.

37:26.256 --> 37:31.228
Look, you guys are just
gonna have to trust us

37:31.261 --> 37:33.029
to make
the right decisions.

37:33.862 --> 37:37.033
Always remember,
we are on your side.

37:37.067 --> 37:40.136
"Remember we're on your side"?
What does that even mean?

37:42.871 --> 37:44.974
Who put my socks
in the underwear drawer?

37:47.143 --> 37:49.379
Guys!

37:49.412 --> 37:52.449
Mr. Marshall said Mom and Dad
are going to do mediation.

37:52.482 --> 37:54.551
Meditation?

37:54.584 --> 37:56.852
No, mediation.

37:56.885 --> 38:01.124
It just means they can't
get a divorce for now.

38:01.157 --> 38:02.392
Holy macaroni.

38:02.425 --> 38:04.427
- Then we did it!
- We did it!

38:04.461 --> 38:06.162
- Yay!
- Yay!

38:19.109 --> 38:20.876
Well, welcome back to
<i>Good Morning Carla.</i>

38:20.909 --> 38:23.546
We have Mr. Donovan
Marshall with us,

38:23.580 --> 38:25.448
and you've had quite
a busy morning, haven't you?

38:25.482 --> 38:27.584
I certainly have,
Meredith.

38:27.617 --> 38:29.552
- You know what...
- Uh. Carla.

38:29.586 --> 38:32.888
But what would you say
to your detractors

38:32.921 --> 38:35.824
who claim that what you're
doing is nothing more

38:35.858 --> 38:37.826
than a self-serving
publicity stunt?

38:37.860 --> 38:43.433
You know what, Meredith? Petty as it may
be, jealousy is rampant in my profession.

38:43.466 --> 38:44.833
Let me tell ya.

38:44.867 --> 38:46.036
Although it is,
and I understand that.

38:46.069 --> 38:48.837
I mean, what you do
I could never do,

38:48.871 --> 38:52.008
uh, but this is
a no-fault state,

38:52.042 --> 38:55.478
and children can't legally
stop their parents

38:55.512 --> 38:56.845
from divorcing.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.214
What do you have
to say about that?

38:58.248 --> 39:00.483
Well, you know
I cannot discuss the details

39:00.517 --> 39:04.387
of my ongoing case, Savannah,
but what I can say is this,

39:04.421 --> 39:08.924
the children... the children
are my main priority.

39:08.957 --> 39:10.926
Well, thank you, Mr. Marshall.
That's great.

39:10.959 --> 39:13.063
We'll be right back
with <i>Good Morning Carla.</i>

39:13.096 --> 39:15.964
<i>Yes! New marshal in town!</i>

39:17.567 --> 39:19.202
Did I wear
the right tie?

39:19.235 --> 39:21.604
Good morning.
Hold a second, please.

39:21.638 --> 39:23.406
The phone has been
ringing all morning.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.241
- That's awesome!
- No, it's not.

39:25.275 --> 39:28.877
Because half the people calling
still drink out of juice boxes.

39:30.513 --> 39:31.880
- Do you see that?
- Hmm?

39:31.914 --> 39:33.450
Someone left that.

39:33.483 --> 39:36.086
It had a note that said,
"There's more where that came from."

39:36.119 --> 39:37.953
My little buddy!

39:37.987 --> 39:40.956
This is serious.
You're not listening to me, Mr. Marshall.

39:40.990 --> 39:43.993
It's not about kids.
Their parents are calling too.

39:44.027 --> 39:45.362
Hmm.

39:45.395 --> 39:48.398
They're accusing you of giving
their children false hope.

39:48.431 --> 39:53.236
Actually, the bar is considering to review your practice.

39:53.269 --> 39:55.372
- Ooh.
- You don't even have a plan.

39:55.405 --> 39:58.974
Oh, Bianca,
of course I have a plan.

39:59.008 --> 40:00.410
It's already in motion.

40:00.443 --> 40:02.145
This case will go away.

40:02.178 --> 40:04.080
They'll figure it all out
in mediation.

40:04.114 --> 40:07.517
There's a new marshal in town,
and he just saved the day.

40:07.550 --> 40:09.519
Pew, pew, pew,
pew, pew!

40:09.552 --> 40:12.355
Ha! We're gonna be rich.

40:12.389 --> 40:16.059
- That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
- Sad's good.

40:16.092 --> 40:18.995
There's money in sad too.

40:20.497 --> 40:22.332
We don't want
to be disturbed.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.402
Trust me,
I've got this covered.

40:25.435 --> 40:28.271
Ah. Speak of the devil. Got to go.

40:28.304 --> 40:29.572
Sit down.

40:29.606 --> 40:33.109
I'm sorry
about this morning.

40:33.143 --> 40:36.312
I'm going through
some personal business.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.149
Your personal business
is all over the news.

40:39.182 --> 40:41.084
It's not good for us,
Brent,

40:41.117 --> 40:43.620
especially now that things
are so fragile.

40:43.653 --> 40:45.255
It makes us look unstable.

40:45.288 --> 40:48.291
- Like we might not be up to the task.
- Well, that was...

40:49.292 --> 40:51.227
That was unintentional.
My, my kids have...

40:51.261 --> 40:53.363
Your private life
is incidental.

40:53.396 --> 40:57.400
I need you to concentrate
on what's important.

40:58.468 --> 41:02.071
Have you figured out who
is dabbling in our pot?

41:02.739 --> 41:04.607
Well, I need
a little bit more time,

41:04.641 --> 41:06.309
- but I think that it's...
- It's Dolva Tech.

41:06.342 --> 41:09.412
Dolva Tech. Right.
I... That was my hunch.

41:09.446 --> 41:13.216
- How did you...
- Don't try to take credit for something that I figured out.

41:13.249 --> 41:17.320
But since I have my priorities
straight, I'm about to make your day.

41:17.353 --> 41:19.088
Do you own a tuxedo?

41:21.224 --> 41:22.725
I think I do, somewhere.

41:22.759 --> 41:26.196
You and I will be attending a
black tie charity benefit tonight.

41:26.229 --> 41:28.765
Harlan Hames will be there.
7:00 p.m. sharp.

41:28.798 --> 41:31.334
It is critical
that you are not late.

41:31.367 --> 41:35.038
Well, that...
It's a little short notice for me.

41:35.071 --> 41:36.972
Do you see what this says?

41:38.775 --> 41:40.610
Uh, "Pain is money.

41:40.643 --> 41:43.379
There is no profit
in happiness."

41:43.413 --> 41:44.514
That's deep.

41:44.547 --> 41:46.416
My father taught me that.

41:46.449 --> 41:51.120
And he also taught me that
winners never make excuses.

41:52.522 --> 41:54.557
Sounds like you had
a magical childhood.

41:56.259 --> 41:59.762
Oh, you're very funny, Brent,
but let's get one thing clear.

41:59.796 --> 42:05.034
This is your last opportunity to impress
upon Harlan that we know what we're doing.

42:05.068 --> 42:07.303
It's all on you.

42:08.104 --> 42:10.540
I appreciate
the second chance.

42:10.573 --> 42:12.242
It's your only chance.

42:22.652 --> 42:25.421
Harlan. How are you?

42:25.455 --> 42:28.424
Yes, we are on our way.
6:00 p.m. on the dot.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.293
Looking forward.

42:40.103 --> 42:41.671
Hey, how's
the homework going?

42:41.704 --> 42:43.072
- Good.
- Good.

42:43.106 --> 42:45.508
Uncle Paul says
to tell you hello.

42:46.309 --> 42:49.445
What? When'd you
talk to him, Ruby?

42:49.479 --> 42:52.515
You don't remember, Mom?
We went to see Uncle Paul...

42:52.549 --> 42:54.617
Last week, for that thing.

42:54.651 --> 42:55.818
- Yeah!
- What?

42:55.852 --> 42:57.787
No, remember when
we went to his house?

42:59.155 --> 43:00.657
What?

43:00.690 --> 43:04.460
All right. Nobody move.
I want to know what's going on.

43:05.428 --> 43:07.430
Hey. Paul.

43:07.463 --> 43:09.632
What a coincidence.

43:09.666 --> 43:11.601
We were just
talking about you.

43:11.634 --> 43:15.104
- Why is he calling here?
- I have no clue.

43:16.472 --> 43:17.507
I'll get it.

43:20.410 --> 43:22.845
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey. Where's your mom?

43:22.879 --> 43:24.247
Kitchen.

43:24.847 --> 43:25.848
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Dad!

43:25.882 --> 43:27.417
Hey, Dad.

43:27.450 --> 43:28.618
Guys!

43:28.651 --> 43:30.186
Quickly.

43:37.794 --> 43:39.596
Uh-huh.

43:39.629 --> 43:40.730
- Hey.
- Yeah.

43:40.763 --> 43:42.332
Where's my tuxedo?

43:42.365 --> 43:43.499
Hey.

43:43.533 --> 43:46.135
- Can it hold for one second?
- Hold on. What are you doing?

43:46.169 --> 43:47.870
- My tuxedo. I need it.
- One second.

43:47.904 --> 43:49.472
Thanks. Okay, bye.

43:49.505 --> 43:51.874
I... Do you know where my tux is?
I need it.

43:51.908 --> 43:53.343
Your what?

43:53.376 --> 43:54.611
My tuxedo. Where is it?

43:54.644 --> 43:57.213
Look, Brent, that was
my brother on the phone.

43:57.246 --> 44:00.316
And he wants to talk to us,
something about the kids.

44:00.350 --> 44:02.318
I think it's in the garage.

44:03.453 --> 44:06.155
- Why isn't this thing working?
- Maybe bad reception?

44:06.189 --> 44:08.725
Maybe. All right,
I got another idea.

44:08.758 --> 44:10.360
Now where are you going?

44:16.599 --> 44:18.201
Did you hear what I said?

44:18.234 --> 44:20.236
You meet with your
brother for the both of us.

44:20.269 --> 44:21.638
He makes me nervous.

44:33.416 --> 44:36.619
I folded all this,
and you're pulling it apart. Please.

44:38.955 --> 44:41.157
Be careful with this.

44:42.425 --> 44:43.593
Wow.

44:43.626 --> 44:45.294
My dress.

44:47.563 --> 44:49.265
I remember this dress.

44:49.966 --> 44:53.169
- It was on our first date.
- Yeah.

44:55.338 --> 44:57.407
Did Dad say he's
going on a date?

44:57.440 --> 44:59.308
What?

45:01.711 --> 45:03.613
We never made time
for us.

45:04.947 --> 45:08.317
What does that even mean?
Of course we made time for us.

45:08.351 --> 45:11.287
It's always about us,
and the house and the kids.

45:11.320 --> 45:15.625
No, that's the problem.
We never make time for us.

45:15.658 --> 45:17.360
You and I.

45:19.495 --> 45:22.732
I'm sorry.
I gotta find this tuxedo.

45:23.599 --> 45:25.334
Of course you do.
Where are you going?

45:25.368 --> 45:29.672
Oh, I'm meeting Chelsea
for this affair at Harlan's.

45:29.706 --> 45:30.973
Who's Chelsea?

45:31.008 --> 45:33.309
What's an affair?

45:33.342 --> 45:36.412
It's the last chance I have
of making this deal.

45:36.446 --> 45:37.947
- Mm.
- Where is it, Sarah?

45:37.981 --> 45:41.484
I might've donated it.

45:42.485 --> 45:43.853
What? Why?

45:45.888 --> 45:49.926
It's not like you've been Prince
Charming lately, and I-I had a moment.

45:49.959 --> 45:51.861
- All right, think.
- Sorry.

45:51.894 --> 45:53.830
Whew, I stink.

45:53.863 --> 45:55.598
Okay.
I know what to do.

45:55.631 --> 45:58.868
I'm gonna call Hayden.

45:58.901 --> 46:00.037
Here, I'm gonna...

46:00.070 --> 46:01.637
Hayden!
Hey, buddy.

46:01.671 --> 46:04.540
Dad's going on a date with
some woman named Chelsea.

46:07.510 --> 46:09.545
You can?
That's perfect!

46:09.579 --> 46:11.514
Okay, I'll see you
there in 30 minutes.

46:11.547 --> 46:14.283
Wait. He still has his tux
from our wedding?

46:14.317 --> 46:16.486
Goes swing dancing
in it every weekend.

46:17.320 --> 46:18.554
- Weird.
- Um...

46:18.588 --> 46:22.725
Can we talk about
this later? Please?

46:23.392 --> 46:24.995
- Sure.
- Yeah. Okay.

46:25.028 --> 46:27.697
Can I use the shower?

46:27.730 --> 46:29.499
You know where it is.

46:29.532 --> 46:30.533
Thanks.

46:43.479 --> 46:45.815
Dad's a huge creep
for doing this to Mom.

46:45.848 --> 46:48.317
Yeah. What are we
gonna do now?

46:48.351 --> 46:50.353
I've got an idea.

46:50.386 --> 46:52.355
- Wait!
- Wait, hold on.

47:18.048 --> 47:19.515
Where are my clothes?

47:19.549 --> 47:21.851
Kids! Bring my clothes
back this instant!

47:27.890 --> 47:31.360
Oh, no. You gotta
be kidding me.

47:31.394 --> 47:33.563
What is wrong
with these kids?

47:45.008 --> 47:46.976
We are gonna talk
about this later!

47:47.010 --> 47:48.878
He'll make
a great impression.

47:48.911 --> 47:49.946
Oh, yeah.

47:53.150 --> 47:54.517
Kids!

47:55.685 --> 47:57.887
Where are you?
Can you come to the kitchen?

48:00.790 --> 48:02.725
Hope we're
not in big trouble.

48:02.758 --> 48:03.994
All right.

48:04.027 --> 48:05.761
We got this. Don't worry.
Just breathe.

48:12.568 --> 48:13.669
Okay.

48:14.104 --> 48:15.771
Uh...

48:15.805 --> 48:18.541
Anything you'd like to tell me
before I go see Uncle Paul?

48:18.574 --> 48:21.011
We respect your bravery,
all things considered.

48:21.044 --> 48:24.380
We want you to know,
we think what Dad is doing is wrong.

48:25.781 --> 48:27.550
We got your back.

48:29.785 --> 48:30.920
Okay.

48:49.106 --> 48:50.907
This is not good.

49:10.559 --> 49:11.761
Paul.

49:12.628 --> 49:14.830
Hey, sis!
So glad you could make it.

49:16.966 --> 49:18.035
Where's Brent?

49:23.572 --> 49:25.142
Oh, it's okay.

49:25.175 --> 49:26.876
Come here, come here.

49:30.913 --> 49:33.716
It's gonna be all right.
I'll make us some tea.

49:39.555 --> 49:42.591
When'd you get all
this chicken wallpaper?

49:42.625 --> 49:45.962
Oh, I just put it up.
Pretty snazzy, huh?

49:47.064 --> 49:48.664
Yeah.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.708
Oh.

49:59.276 --> 50:00.676
Chickens.

50:33.642 --> 50:35.078
- Sir, what are you doing?
- Hi.

50:35.112 --> 50:36.545
Uh...

50:36.579 --> 50:40.117
Is this a party
for Harlan Hames?

50:40.150 --> 50:41.584
It is.

50:41.617 --> 50:43.753
Yes. Great.
Nobody's wearing a tuxedo.

50:43.786 --> 50:47.590
<i>♪ Hey, hey there, baby
Something just ain't right ♪</i>

50:47.623 --> 50:49.692
It's not really a tuxedo
kind of establishment.

50:49.725 --> 50:53.030
Uh, yeah, well, my friend
dropped off a tuxedo

50:53.063 --> 50:54.797
for you to give to me.

50:55.232 --> 50:57.034
A short guy.

50:57.067 --> 50:58.801
But nobody's
wearing a tuxedo.

50:58.834 --> 51:01.837
You know it's not a pajama
party either, right?

51:01.871 --> 51:04.840
In hindsight,
I realize it was wrong to interfere

51:04.874 --> 51:06.575
without talking
to you first.

51:06.609 --> 51:10.646
But... the kids,
they just tugged at my heart.

51:10.679 --> 51:12.748
So I reached out to an
old college buddy of mine

51:12.782 --> 51:17.054
in hopes that he would be able
to connect me with you and Brent.

51:18.088 --> 51:19.955
So this was
all your idea?

51:20.790 --> 51:22.758
Well, I mean,
not entirely.

51:22.792 --> 51:25.028
I didn't know that Donovan
was gonna create

51:25.062 --> 51:26.997
such a media circus.

51:27.030 --> 51:30.233
Look, I know you don't always want
advice from your older brother,

51:30.267 --> 51:32.701
but in my opinion,

51:32.735 --> 51:35.604
divorce isn't always the option
that people think it is.

51:36.705 --> 51:40.676
So I'm just supposed to stay
in a miserable marriage?

51:41.178 --> 51:42.845
Is it really
that miserable?

51:43.746 --> 51:45.382
I mean, I recall
two lovebirds

51:45.415 --> 51:47.250
that couldn't get enough
of each other.

51:51.988 --> 51:53.056
Yeah.

51:53.789 --> 51:55.724
I did fall in love
with him.

51:58.861 --> 52:00.863
But we're just
so different now.

52:06.269 --> 52:08.271
Marriage
is a loyal partnership.

52:08.305 --> 52:12.375
Do you really think God would
leave you with just two options?

52:12.409 --> 52:14.743
Misery or divorce?

52:15.112 --> 52:16.146
That's a myth.

52:16.980 --> 52:17.813
Well...

52:19.049 --> 52:21.251
the children deserve
to live in a home

52:21.284 --> 52:24.854
where their parents aren't
fighting all the time.

52:27.090 --> 52:28.924
The children deserve
to live in a home

52:28.958 --> 52:32.628
where their parents learn to
not fight with each other.

52:35.132 --> 52:37.766
Well, we're meeting with
the mediator tomorrow,

52:37.800 --> 52:42.105
and I don't even know
where to start.

52:43.340 --> 52:44.974
Sarah, you can
get a divorce.

52:45.008 --> 52:47.710
That is an option that is
certainly available to you,

52:47.743 --> 52:50.413
but you owe it to yourself
and to your children

52:50.447 --> 52:52.882
to be honest about
why you're doing it.

52:57.820 --> 53:01.324
<i>♪ Baby, tell me who she is ♪</i>

53:01.358 --> 53:02.425
Great band.

53:02.459 --> 53:05.728
Mm. Little Sue
and the Cow Tippers.

53:05.761 --> 53:07.297
- Oh.
- That's Tony on the drums.

53:07.330 --> 53:08.331
He's my cousin.

53:08.365 --> 53:10.167
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

53:10.200 --> 53:13.069
- Listen, Chelsea... May I call you Chelsea?
- Of course.

53:13.103 --> 53:15.738
I've been kicking this around
for a long time now,

53:15.771 --> 53:17.040
and, you know,
I have to say,

53:17.073 --> 53:18.874
it's not like
I love Dolva Tech.

53:18.908 --> 53:20.943
You know, like a cat
loves a cream jar.

53:20.976 --> 53:23.046
But I have to say,
right now,

53:23.079 --> 53:25.081
Dolva Tech's offer's
better than Peterson's.

53:25.115 --> 53:30.053
And I got 2,000 loyal
employees I look after.

53:30.086 --> 53:31.720
It's 500 individuals,

53:31.754 --> 53:34.790
1,500 families,
3,500 children

53:34.823 --> 53:36.426
and 300 or 400
grandchildren.

53:36.459 --> 53:38.261
You know how many people
that is?

53:38.295 --> 53:40.263
It's...
It's a lot of people,

53:40.297 --> 53:43.766
and they're gonna still need
their jobs after I retire.

53:44.467 --> 53:47.437
Oh, these here,
these are my favorites.

53:47.470 --> 53:49.872
Mm. Can't get
enough of them.

53:49.905 --> 53:52.242
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

53:52.275 --> 53:54.244
- Mr. Hames...
- Oh, hey, Chelsea,

53:55.045 --> 53:55.744
call me Harlan.

53:55.778 --> 53:57.846
Consider allowing
Brent Lambert

53:57.880 --> 53:59.149
to review
Dolva Tech's offer.

53:59.182 --> 54:02.485
Brent is our chief
strategist in acquisitions.

54:02.519 --> 54:07.190
If he fails to convince you that Peterson
is a better home for your company,

54:07.224 --> 54:08.491
then my job is done,

54:08.525 --> 54:11.161
and I wish you and Dolva
Tech great success,

54:11.194 --> 54:12.495
with no hard feelings.

54:12.529 --> 54:14.897
That's mighty big
of you, Chelsea.

54:14.930 --> 54:19.102
You seem to have a lot of
confidence in this Brent fella.

54:19.135 --> 54:22.138
- Mm. He's levelheaded, reliable.
- And late.

54:22.172 --> 54:24.740
<i>♪ Waiting on you to come home ♪</i>

54:27.544 --> 54:30.247
I think I see the people
I'm looking for.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.314
Excuse me.

54:35.585 --> 54:37.487
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.
Sorry, excuse me.

54:37.520 --> 54:38.854
This is
my favorite song.

54:38.887 --> 54:40.490
Sorry. Chelsea,
Mr. Hames.

54:40.523 --> 54:41.857
You gotta be kidding me.

54:41.890 --> 54:43.859
Ms. Dwyer, do you
know this fella?

54:43.892 --> 54:45.295
Brent, what's
come over you?

54:45.328 --> 54:48.298
- I can explain.
- You know what, son?

54:48.331 --> 54:49.832
Pink's your color.

54:49.865 --> 54:51.167
I've been looking
for slippers like that.

54:51.201 --> 54:54.271
Well, I'm...
I'm a little bit confused here.

54:54.304 --> 54:56.573
Nobody's dressed
in a tuxedo.

54:56.606 --> 54:58.907
Who wears a tux
to a barbecue, Brent?

54:58.941 --> 55:00.809
You told me
that this was a...

55:00.843 --> 55:02.545
I told you
to be here on time!

55:02.579 --> 55:04.813
And now you mocked me
in front of our client

55:04.847 --> 55:07.083
by showing up looking
like some insane person.

55:07.117 --> 55:09.252
- What?
- Is this alcohol? Drugs?

55:09.286 --> 55:10.420
We're gonna
get you help.

55:10.453 --> 55:11.588
All right, come on.

55:11.621 --> 55:13.490
Come on.
Come on, buddy.

55:13.523 --> 55:14.857
I am so sorry.

55:14.890 --> 55:16.393
I think the pressure
just got to him.

55:16.426 --> 55:19.396
That's a crying shame when a
grown man buckles like that.

55:19.429 --> 55:21.331
<i>♪ Waitin' on you to come home ♪</i>

56:25.995 --> 56:30.266
Divorce
is such a harsh word.

56:31.234 --> 56:35.472
I prefer the term
matrimonial restructuring.

56:36.306 --> 56:39.042
And as your
court-appointed mediator,

56:39.075 --> 56:41.910
and in the spirit
of harmony,

56:41.944 --> 56:44.481
I would like to
welcome you both.

56:46.616 --> 56:49.119
Oh, would either of you care

56:49.152 --> 56:54.890
for some organic
hibiscus-infused moon tea?

56:56.292 --> 56:57.293
How much?

56:57.327 --> 57:02.132
Oh, a single cup should
interface your chakra

57:02.165 --> 57:04.134
and body mind,
allowing for...

57:04.167 --> 57:07.003
How much is this
going to cost?

57:07.036 --> 57:10.973
Oh, I see.

57:11.307 --> 57:12.542
Well,

57:12.575 --> 57:14.144
I recommend

57:14.177 --> 57:17.714
a minimum of two 90-minute
sessions per week,

57:17.747 --> 57:20.049
spread out over
three to five months.

57:20.083 --> 57:22.285
- And that should be enough...
- All right. You know what?

57:23.453 --> 57:25.422
- I've had enough.
- Brent!

57:25.455 --> 57:26.623
That's a "no" to the tea?

57:26.656 --> 57:28.458
What are we doing, Sarah?

57:29.359 --> 57:30.393
Really?

57:31.494 --> 57:33.363
Our kids are
out of control.

57:33.396 --> 57:35.198
I've lost my job.

57:35.231 --> 57:37.600
And here we are
spending everything

57:37.634 --> 57:39.536
just to see
who gets what's left.

57:39.569 --> 57:41.304
None of this
was my idea.

57:41.337 --> 57:43.306
Actually,
this was all your idea.

57:46.075 --> 57:49.579
Can't we just agree that the
both of us have made mistakes

57:49.612 --> 57:50.747
and move on from there?

57:50.780 --> 57:52.348
You know what?
Forget it.

57:52.382 --> 57:54.284
What, just like that?
You're just gonna walk away?

57:54.317 --> 57:56.286
We didn't have any help
to get married,

57:56.319 --> 57:59.088
and we sure as heck don't need
anybody's help to get divorced.

58:04.260 --> 58:07.430
Mm, I'm so sorry.

58:07.464 --> 58:08.565
Did you want some?

58:09.799 --> 58:11.234
<i>What?</i>

58:12.235 --> 58:14.003
Well, did you

58:14.537 --> 58:16.573
Yeah.
Okay, thank you.

58:19.642 --> 58:21.110
Well, that's that.

58:21.611 --> 58:23.012
What happened?

58:24.047 --> 58:25.615
Your parents
rejected mediation.

58:25.648 --> 58:27.350
I guess,
from the looks of it,

58:27.383 --> 58:29.552
your dad's having
a nervous breakdown.

58:29.586 --> 58:32.655
Word on the street is he
lost his job last night,

58:32.689 --> 58:34.757
and he showed up
to a charity event

58:34.791 --> 58:37.327
in a nightgown
and fuzzy slippers.

58:42.565 --> 58:45.502
Did you say
a charity event?

58:45.535 --> 58:47.136
Yeah.

58:47.170 --> 58:49.472
Sometimes the pressure can
get to be too much for a man.

58:49.506 --> 58:51.674
What do we do now?

58:51.708 --> 58:54.210
Nothing.

58:55.144 --> 58:57.213
We took a shot.
It didn't pan out.

58:57.780 --> 58:59.215
I don't understand.

58:59.249 --> 59:01.484
Don't start that, okay?

59:01.518 --> 59:02.652
Cut it out.

59:02.685 --> 59:05.154
You're killing me, kid.
Come on.

59:05.188 --> 59:07.390
You said you'd help.

59:07.423 --> 59:09.259
I said I'd try.

59:09.292 --> 59:10.260
Okay?

59:10.293 --> 59:12.462
Look, I said
I'd buy you some time,

59:12.495 --> 59:13.530
and that's what I did.

59:13.563 --> 59:15.064
I said from the start,

59:15.098 --> 59:18.101
there's no way to stop
a couple from divorcing.

59:18.134 --> 59:20.303
They have to decide that
on their own.

59:21.237 --> 59:23.306
It's time you kids
accept that. Okay?

59:24.340 --> 59:27.110
It's okay, Mr. Marshall.
I know you did your best.

59:27.677 --> 59:29.345
Goodbye, Mr. Marshall.

59:29.379 --> 59:32.448
Goodbye. Thank you.
Thanks for coming.

59:39.255 --> 59:41.558
Now don't you start.

59:42.525 --> 59:44.127
We made Dad lose his job.

59:44.160 --> 59:45.528
I thought he was
going on a date.

59:45.562 --> 59:48.131
- It's all our fault.
- It's okay, it's not.

1:00:02.779 --> 1:00:03.846
Paul!

1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:05.548
Yeah,
I'm around back.

1:00:10.253 --> 1:00:12.789
Hey, you...
You got a minute?

1:00:12.822 --> 1:00:14.223
Sure!

1:00:15.458 --> 1:00:17.760
How come you have a street
sign in your backyard?

1:00:17.794 --> 1:00:19.262
Oh, that?

1:00:19.295 --> 1:00:21.164
That fell down out front
during the last storm.

1:00:21.197 --> 1:00:23.466
It was on my to-do list
to put them back up.

1:00:26.636 --> 1:00:30.607
Isn't that a culinary torch
that you use to make desserts?

1:00:31.574 --> 1:00:33.643
Oh, yeah, but it's also
a really good welder.

1:00:33.676 --> 1:00:35.712
Like, I've been watching
these how-to-do videos,

1:00:35.745 --> 1:00:39.248
and it's amazing the uses you
can get out of this little guy.

1:00:39.849 --> 1:00:41.250
All righty.

1:00:43.586 --> 1:00:45.154
Hey, I'm sorry that

1:00:45.188 --> 1:00:47.290
I didn't get over here
the other day with Sarah.

1:00:47.323 --> 1:00:50.760
Work has been
a little crazy lately.

1:00:50.793 --> 1:00:52.462
Really? I thought
you got canned

1:00:52.495 --> 1:00:55.198
for wearing a muumuu
to a charity event.

1:00:55.798 --> 1:00:58.768
Hey, it was a pink
polka-dotted robe

1:00:58.801 --> 1:01:00.703
and white,
fuzzy slippers, okay?

1:01:00.737 --> 1:01:02.238
Even better.

1:01:02.271 --> 1:01:04.307
Trying to make
a statement, huh?

1:01:04.340 --> 1:01:07.510
Well, that's... I guess
that's one way to look at it.

1:01:08.678 --> 1:01:10.647
I'm sorry, it's just
that my kids, um...

1:01:12.215 --> 1:01:13.549
My kids have
been acting out,

1:01:13.583 --> 1:01:16.285
and I think this divorce
is taking its toll on them.

1:01:16.319 --> 1:01:17.587
Yeah, about that.
Look, I...

1:01:17.620 --> 1:01:19.922
I apologize for things
getting out of hand.

1:01:19.956 --> 1:01:21.290
You have no idea.

1:01:21.324 --> 1:01:23.359
And Donovan
has assured me

1:01:23.393 --> 1:01:25.695
that he is no longer
involved in your divorce.

1:01:29.632 --> 1:01:30.700
Paul...

1:01:31.768 --> 1:01:33.503
why is it so hard?

1:01:33.536 --> 1:01:36.639
Well, did you think that
turning your world upside down

1:01:36.673 --> 1:01:37.707
would be easy?

1:01:39.409 --> 1:01:41.544
I mean, tons of people
get divorced every day.

1:01:41.577 --> 1:01:44.414
That's the point.
None of this is gonna be easy.

1:01:44.447 --> 1:01:47.250
I mean, nobody wins in a
divorce except the attorneys.

1:01:48.018 --> 1:01:49.652
This is tearing us apart.

1:01:49.686 --> 1:01:51.821
Well, that's exactly what
is supposed to be happening.

1:01:51.854 --> 1:01:54.624
Look, God develops this
redemptive plan for the world,

1:01:54.657 --> 1:01:57.694
and divorce just tears
at the heart of it.

1:01:57.727 --> 1:02:00.563
Yeah, but I don't think
you know our situation.

1:02:00.596 --> 1:02:03.299
Maybe I don't,
but your kids came to me

1:02:03.332 --> 1:02:05.334
because they saw something
that you don't.

1:02:05.368 --> 1:02:08.671
And maybe your marriage
is just so beyond fixable

1:02:08.705 --> 1:02:11.474
that there's just no reason
to try any longer.

1:02:14.677 --> 1:02:18.748
Uh, look, I'm sorry
that we haven't been close.

1:02:20.416 --> 1:02:22.752
I just want to thank you
for looking after us.

1:02:22.785 --> 1:02:25.621
We are a family.
It's what we do.

1:02:25.655 --> 1:02:27.223
Ow!

1:02:28.324 --> 1:02:31.360
You might want to
take a break from all this.

1:02:31.394 --> 1:02:33.362
Oh. Yeah, probably
a good idea.

1:02:33.396 --> 1:02:35.798
Oh, hey, I'm fixing to
glaze a baked ham for lunch.

1:02:35.832 --> 1:02:37.433
You want to join?

1:02:38.035 --> 1:02:39.002
With that?

1:02:39.036 --> 1:02:40.470
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

1:02:40.503 --> 1:02:42.605
Yeah, no, it's...
I'm okay.

1:02:42.638 --> 1:02:45.441
- Might do a crème brûlée!
- All right.

1:02:56.086 --> 1:02:58.821
- Goodbye, Mr. Marshall.
- Good night, Bianca.

1:02:58.855 --> 1:03:01.457
You know what?
I need to get this off my chest.

1:03:01.491 --> 1:03:04.327
Those kids came here sincerely
asking you for your help.

1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:06.896
But you made this
all about you.

1:03:06.929 --> 1:03:09.066
"The new marshal in town."

1:03:09.099 --> 1:03:10.933
I believe that you
can help those kids

1:03:10.967 --> 1:03:13.636
if you stop
being so selfish.

1:03:14.470 --> 1:03:17.406
You are a good lawyer.
Act like it!

1:03:18.341 --> 1:03:20.443
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

1:03:20.476 --> 1:03:21.944
- I will definitely...
- Think about it.

1:03:21.978 --> 1:03:25.983
Those kids are not the only
ones Uncle Paul is helping here.

1:03:26.016 --> 1:03:27.850
Good night, Mr. Marshall.

1:03:29.119 --> 1:03:30.820
Good night, Bianca.

1:03:36.692 --> 1:03:37.995
Hmm.

1:03:38.028 --> 1:03:40.563
Proverbs 31:8.

1:03:42.899 --> 1:03:45.568
Proverbs 31:8.

1:03:46.669 --> 1:03:49.705
"Speak up for those who
cannot speak for themselves,

1:03:49.739 --> 1:03:53.910
for the rights of all
who are vulnerable."

1:03:56.113 --> 1:03:57.480
Speak up.

1:04:24.007 --> 1:04:25.408
Four.

1:04:33.783 --> 1:04:34.917
Come on!

1:04:43.659 --> 1:04:44.594
Hello.

1:05:01.510 --> 1:05:04.081
There's a new marshal in town.

1:05:04.114 --> 1:05:06.916
Pew, pew. Pew, pew, pew.

1:05:06.949 --> 1:05:10.386
Mr. Marshall.

1:05:11.921 --> 1:05:12.922
Mr. Marshall?

1:05:15.658 --> 1:05:16.759
Aw!

1:05:16.792 --> 1:05:18.961
Looks like you found you
a new friend.

1:05:18.996 --> 1:05:20.030
Huh?

1:05:20.063 --> 1:05:22.132
Huh?

1:05:22.165 --> 1:05:24.934
Yeah.
That's funny.

1:05:25.668 --> 1:05:26.669
Bianca.

1:05:27.870 --> 1:05:29.739
I just want to say that,

1:05:29.772 --> 1:05:33.476
well, everything you said
to me last night is true.

1:05:34.011 --> 1:05:35.578
I have been
a little selfish,

1:05:35.611 --> 1:05:37.480
and I haven't given
this thing my best shot.

1:05:37.513 --> 1:05:39.182
Pardon?

1:05:39.216 --> 1:05:41.584
Excuse me?

1:05:41.617 --> 1:05:43.786
Did you just say
that I was right?

1:05:44.787 --> 1:05:47.090
We got a lot of work to do.
Okay, Bianca?

1:05:47.124 --> 1:05:48.992
Finally!

1:05:49.026 --> 1:05:52.795
Does that mean that I can
have a new coffeemaker?

1:05:53.230 --> 1:05:56.599
Maybe.

1:06:20.190 --> 1:06:21.992
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:06:23.526 --> 1:06:27.130
I just wanted to come by.

1:06:27.164 --> 1:06:28.698
Sorry.

1:06:29.699 --> 1:06:32.702
Sure you don't
want to get that?

1:06:32.735 --> 1:06:33.836
Yeah. Sure.

1:06:36.006 --> 1:06:37.673
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

1:06:37.707 --> 1:06:40.576
for what I said at the
mediator's office yesterday.

1:06:40.609 --> 1:06:41.911
I was out of line.

1:06:46.149 --> 1:06:49.852
Well, this is unexpected.

1:06:50.988 --> 1:06:52.488
Thank you.

1:06:53.290 --> 1:06:54.690
You're welcome.

1:06:56.592 --> 1:06:58.128
Anyway, I gotta get
back to the office.

1:06:58.161 --> 1:07:02.698
Chelsea was kind enough to
allow me to box up my stuff

1:07:02.732 --> 1:07:04.967
and take the walk of shame,
so...

1:07:08.804 --> 1:07:10.606
Of course. Go.

1:07:10.639 --> 1:07:14.510
And, uh,
see you in court.

1:07:16.079 --> 1:07:17.114
Yep.

1:07:19.182 --> 1:07:20.583
Okay.

1:07:36.066 --> 1:07:37.200
<i>Hello?</i>

1:07:37.234 --> 1:07:39.236
Isabel.
Donovan Marshall here.

1:07:39.269 --> 1:07:40.836
Mr. Marshall?

1:07:40.870 --> 1:07:42.872
Listen, tomorrow your parents
are going back to court.

1:07:42.905 --> 1:07:45.142
Mr. Marshall, I get you
don't want to help us,

1:07:45.175 --> 1:07:46.842
but let's not rub salt
in the wound.

1:07:46.876 --> 1:07:49.312
- <i>No, no, no, no. I want to help.</i>
- Really?

1:07:49.346 --> 1:07:52.249
Yeah!
I think I found it.

1:07:52.282 --> 1:07:53.716
Found what?

1:07:53.749 --> 1:07:55.285
<i>Okay, this is
a long shot,</i>

1:07:55.318 --> 1:07:58.221
but I got one important
question for you.

1:07:58.255 --> 1:08:00.123
Do your parents
still love each other?

1:08:00.157 --> 1:08:01.857
I know they do.

1:08:01.891 --> 1:08:04.327
Well, then your parents
just need to be reminded.

1:08:04.361 --> 1:08:05.795
Reminded?

1:08:05.828 --> 1:08:08.331
Isabel, sometimes adults
need a little push

1:08:08.365 --> 1:08:10.100
in the right direction
so they can remember

1:08:10.133 --> 1:08:12.369
<i>why they chose that path
in the first place.</i>

1:08:12.402 --> 1:08:14.737
<i>Okay!
Let me think about it.</i>

1:08:14.770 --> 1:08:16.972
- <i>Bye!</i>
- <i>Bye-bye.</i>

1:08:19.842 --> 1:08:20.910
Reminded?

1:08:21.844 --> 1:08:22.945
I got it.

1:08:24.047 --> 1:08:26.349
I knew there was a <i>corazón</i>
over there somewhere.

1:08:27.917 --> 1:08:29.986
See? I told you it was
going to be good for you.

1:08:30.020 --> 1:08:33.756
I'm a pretty good guy,
aren't I?

1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:40.230
I found an extra one.
Thought you might need it.

1:08:40.263 --> 1:08:41.864
Ah! This will
fit perfectly.

1:08:43.333 --> 1:08:45.235
Don't forget to lock up.

1:08:46.002 --> 1:08:47.370
Hey! Have
a wonderful evening.

1:08:47.404 --> 1:08:49.005
Don't speak to me.

1:08:49.039 --> 1:08:51.408
Ooh. They don't make 'em
like that no more.

1:08:51.441 --> 1:08:53.276
Okay, anyway.

1:08:53.310 --> 1:08:55.678
You was right about something being
fishy about this whole deal, okay?

1:08:55.711 --> 1:08:57.713
I looked into the company

1:08:57.746 --> 1:09:00.984
that was sponsoring the expo
that Chelsea was attending,

1:09:01.017 --> 1:09:03.987
and it's called A...

1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:05.088
AG...

1:09:05.122 --> 1:09:06.856
AG... AGZ,

1:09:06.889 --> 1:09:08.691
AGZ Tech.

1:09:08.724 --> 1:09:12.695
AGZ Tech is the sister company
to Dolva Tech.

1:09:13.430 --> 1:09:15.332
And I'm pretty sure
Chelsea's on the board,

1:09:15.365 --> 1:09:18.734
but don't quote me on that because
I'm still waiting for intel.

1:09:19.402 --> 1:09:22.172
Of course!
Of course, she's...

1:09:22.205 --> 1:09:23.373
Mm-hmm.

1:09:23.406 --> 1:09:25.242
Chelsea's playing
both sides.

1:09:25.275 --> 1:09:27.077
It's a slice and dice.

1:09:27.110 --> 1:09:29.745
All they wanted was
Hames's patents.

1:09:29.778 --> 1:09:31.714
- Mm-hmm.
- So,

1:09:31.747 --> 1:09:34.417
Dolva Tech
liquidates Allied,

1:09:34.451 --> 1:09:36.052
their stock goes
through the roof...

1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:41.091
and Chelsea makes
a chunk of change.

1:09:41.124 --> 1:09:42.292
Boom.

1:09:44.227 --> 1:09:45.262
Hey.

1:09:46.795 --> 1:09:48.298
I'm sorry I haven't been
more supportive lately.

1:09:48.331 --> 1:09:50.900
I really am, and I appreciate
you looking out for me.

1:09:50.933 --> 1:09:54.171
Hey, man, look,
you're my boy.

1:09:54.204 --> 1:09:55.938
You're my amigo.
Okay?

1:09:55.971 --> 1:09:59.009
I didn't want to see you
go out like that, man.

1:09:59.042 --> 1:09:59.842
You okay?

1:09:59.875 --> 1:10:02.045
I mean, you know,
bittersweet, but...

1:10:06.483 --> 1:10:08.751
Oh, it's from Sarah.

1:10:08.784 --> 1:10:10.086
She wants to talk.

1:10:11.321 --> 1:10:12.821
You miss her, huh?

1:10:13.223 --> 1:10:14.457
I do.

1:10:14.491 --> 1:10:16.259
- Oh! Dad texted back.
- Hurry up.

1:10:19.496 --> 1:10:22.831
"Meet at 6:00."

1:10:22.865 --> 1:10:24.301
- Delete! Quickly.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1:10:24.334 --> 1:10:26.136
Send. Delete.

1:10:29.439 --> 1:10:30.873
You know what, man?

1:10:30.906 --> 1:10:32.475
Get outta here.
Go put on something nice.

1:10:32.509 --> 1:10:34.810
And don't wear
that bathrobe, please.

1:10:34.843 --> 1:10:36.479
Get out of here,
brother.

1:10:36.513 --> 1:10:37.913
Thanks, Cal.

1:10:40.016 --> 1:10:40.984
Ah!

1:10:41.017 --> 1:10:44.087
- Hey, did you finish that project?
- Yeah.

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:46.122
- And you're ready for your test?
- Yes.

1:10:46.156 --> 1:10:48.958
- Okay.
- Almost done.

1:10:56.166 --> 1:10:59.102
Hey, would you guys mind
watching Ruby tonight?

1:10:59.135 --> 1:11:01.971
Oh, not at all.
I can work on some math facts with her.

1:11:02.005 --> 1:11:04.407
And I can whip up a nice
little meal for all of us.

1:11:04.441 --> 1:11:05.908
Thank you, honey.

1:11:09.812 --> 1:11:11.281
Okay.

1:11:12.382 --> 1:11:13.782
Yes!

1:11:29.898 --> 1:11:31.468
You look beautiful.

1:11:33.136 --> 1:11:35.838
I haven't heard you say that
in a long time.

1:11:39.042 --> 1:11:42.978
This place
has not changed a bit.

1:11:43.912 --> 1:11:46.316
Yeah. I was surprised
you asked me here.

1:11:47.183 --> 1:11:48.418
Me?

1:11:48.451 --> 1:11:50.020
You're the one
that suggested we...

1:11:50.053 --> 1:11:52.122
Good evening,
and welcome to Tony's.

1:11:52.155 --> 1:11:54.557
My name is Thomas.
I'll be serving you this evening.

1:11:54.591 --> 1:11:57.427
Could I interest you in
a complimentary appetizer

1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.195
prepared especially
for you?

1:12:00.163 --> 1:12:02.165
- Uh, sure. Thank you.
- What in the world?

1:12:02.198 --> 1:12:03.266
You're welcome.

1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:05.402
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1:12:05.435 --> 1:12:06.935
What is this?

1:12:11.474 --> 1:12:12.875
Did you do this?

1:12:12.908 --> 1:12:14.843
It must've
been the kids.

1:12:19.983 --> 1:12:21.584
"Why you luv each other."

1:12:21.618 --> 1:12:23.952
That's definitely
Ruby's writing.

1:12:27.956 --> 1:12:30.926
Oh, look at Ruby.

1:12:32.329 --> 1:12:34.197
- She's a little chunky.
- Little chunky.

1:12:37.233 --> 1:12:38.967
Our wedding picture.

1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:47.077
Look at... There's
so much stuff in here.

1:12:47.110 --> 1:12:48.211
Look at...

1:12:48.244 --> 1:12:50.080
Oh, boy.

1:12:50.980 --> 1:12:53.049
I did this of you
right here.

1:12:54.084 --> 1:12:55.985
"Do you believe
in love at first sight?"

1:12:56.653 --> 1:12:58.021
Yeah.

1:12:59.022 --> 1:13:02.292
And I said,
"Love at first sight is easy.

1:13:02.325 --> 1:13:04.927
It's when two people
who have been staring

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:07.230
at each other
for years,

1:13:07.263 --> 1:13:09.999
that's when it
becomes a miracle."

1:13:12.068 --> 1:13:14.404
You remember what you
said to me after that?

1:13:15.638 --> 1:13:17.407
Come on, Brent,
do you remember?

1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:19.975
Look, I'm tired of
kicking this thing back and forth.

1:13:20.009 --> 1:13:22.978
Get out there, nail down
this deal with Dolva Tech.

1:13:23.012 --> 1:13:24.647
All right?
Well, go on!

1:13:24.681 --> 1:13:27.417
Brent?
Do you remember?

1:13:27.450 --> 1:13:28.917
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

1:13:28.951 --> 1:13:30.487
Will you excuse me
just for a minute?

1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:32.055
What... Where
are you going?

1:13:32.088 --> 1:13:34.391
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I promise.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.002
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Hames?

1:13:46.035 --> 1:13:47.704
Well, do I know you?

1:13:47.737 --> 1:13:50.006
May... May I have
a word with you, sir?

1:13:50.039 --> 1:13:53.009
- Oh, yeah. Wait a minute, you...
- We met.

1:13:53.042 --> 1:13:55.111
Yeah. You're the
fella from the barbecue with...

1:13:55.145 --> 1:13:57.480
Yes. That's... That's me.
May I sit?

1:13:57.514 --> 1:13:59.416
All right, all right.
Have a seat.

1:14:00.583 --> 1:14:02.152
Thank you, sir.

1:14:02.185 --> 1:14:04.687
Um, about that, I just...
I'm Brent Lambert,

1:14:04.721 --> 1:14:06.656
and I want to apologize
for the other night.

1:14:06.689 --> 1:14:08.458
Unbelievable.

1:14:22.272 --> 1:14:27.110
Sir, I'm going through some
personal issues right now,

1:14:27.143 --> 1:14:29.279
which is not the reason
why I came over here.

1:14:29.312 --> 1:14:32.348
It's about your company
and the sale to Dolva Tech.

1:14:35.318 --> 1:14:37.587
I'll give you to
the end of my drink.

1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:39.222
Okay.

1:14:39.255 --> 1:14:41.591
Uh, Dolva Tech plans on
chopping up Allied United Farms

1:14:41.624 --> 1:14:43.726
and selling it off
in bits and pieces.

1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:45.228
I'm almost certain of it.

1:14:45.261 --> 1:14:47.130
Also, I believe,
and I can't prove this,

1:14:47.163 --> 1:14:50.166
that Chelsea was
playing both sides.

1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:53.102
She sits on the board on one
of Dolva Tech's subsidiaries

1:14:53.136 --> 1:14:55.338
and stands to make
a lot of money

1:14:55.371 --> 1:14:57.073
from the sale
of their stock,

1:14:57.106 --> 1:14:59.075
which is why she sabotaged
the sale for Peterson.

1:14:59.108 --> 1:15:01.144
But she needed
to cover her tracks,

1:15:01.177 --> 1:15:03.513
which is why
she set me up, sir.

1:15:03.546 --> 1:15:06.115
And, honestly, Mr. Hames,

1:15:06.149 --> 1:15:09.352
if I wasn't so preoccupied
with my divorce,

1:15:09.385 --> 1:15:12.155
I would have seen this
much sooner.

1:15:12.188 --> 1:15:13.223
And...

1:15:14.257 --> 1:15:18.094
if I wasn't so preoccupied
with my work,

1:15:18.127 --> 1:15:20.063
I would have spent
more time with my wife,

1:15:20.096 --> 1:15:22.999
and I wouldn't be
in this position.

1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:25.468
Sir. So, anyway.

1:15:29.839 --> 1:15:32.509
I don't like being
hornswoggled, Brent.

1:15:32.542 --> 1:15:34.143
No, you're not, sir.

1:15:34.177 --> 1:15:37.347
I'm to blame.
I'm the one accountable.

1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:38.515
Hmm. Yeah.

1:15:38.548 --> 1:15:40.650
Well, blame and accountability
are two different things.

1:15:40.683 --> 1:15:45.522
To be accountable, well,
that's to be responsible for fixing things

1:15:45.555 --> 1:15:46.656
when they go haywire.

1:15:47.457 --> 1:15:49.259
And blame, that's
the price you pay

1:15:49.292 --> 1:15:51.394
from running away
from responsibility.

1:15:51.427 --> 1:15:53.029
Yeah.

1:15:56.099 --> 1:15:58.268
- I like you, Brent.
- Thank you.

1:15:58.301 --> 1:16:00.270
I'll have my boys
check this out,

1:16:00.303 --> 1:16:02.505
and if what you say
holds water...

1:16:04.207 --> 1:16:05.575
heads are gonna roll.

1:16:06.709 --> 1:16:08.645
I appreciate that, sir.

1:16:08.678 --> 1:16:10.580
Um, excuse me.

1:16:41.277 --> 1:16:44.447
Okay. Goodbye, Mom. Love you.

1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:45.682
That was Mom.

1:16:45.715 --> 1:16:47.850
- She didn't sound very happy.
- Well, what are we gonna do?

1:16:47.884 --> 1:16:49.552
We can't let them go
to court tomorrow.

1:16:49.586 --> 1:16:52.455
We could try "Ruby's got a
fever." That always works.

1:16:52.488 --> 1:16:54.557
Tricks aren't going to
work this time, guys.

1:16:54.591 --> 1:16:56.092
It's up to them.

1:16:57.627 --> 1:16:59.662
One can be overpowered.

1:16:59.696 --> 1:17:01.497
Two can
defend their selves.

1:17:01.531 --> 1:17:04.300
But a cord of three
is not easily broken.

1:17:04.334 --> 1:17:06.569
We ask these things
in Jesus' name.

1:17:06.603 --> 1:17:07.637
Amen.

1:17:18.748 --> 1:17:22.352
Am I to understand
that you both have terminated

1:17:22.385 --> 1:17:25.288
your legal relationships
with your counsel?

1:17:25.321 --> 1:17:27.223
- Yes, Judge.
- Yes, Judge.

1:17:27.256 --> 1:17:28.691
I see.

1:17:28.725 --> 1:17:33.229
And what's your dog in the hunt
here, Mr. Marshall?

1:17:33.262 --> 1:17:35.365
Well, Your Honor,
it is my clients' wishes

1:17:35.398 --> 1:17:37.634
to withdraw their petition
for injunction

1:17:37.667 --> 1:17:42.639
and let these proceedings
proceed unencumbered.

1:17:42.672 --> 1:17:44.474
A sensible decision.

1:17:44.507 --> 1:17:47.410
Well, since there are
no further objections

1:17:47.443 --> 1:17:49.946
in the matter of
<i>Lambert vs. Lambert,</i>

1:17:49.979 --> 1:17:53.282
I hereby order a decree
for divorce shall be...

1:17:53.316 --> 1:17:55.184
Uh, provided, of course,

1:17:55.218 --> 1:17:57.920
that the litigants can provide
satisfactory evidence

1:17:57.954 --> 1:17:59.389
to that end.

1:18:01.858 --> 1:18:03.393
Excuse me?

1:18:03.426 --> 1:18:05.294
Well, Your Honor, may I
draw the court's attention

1:18:05.328 --> 1:18:11.567
to California Code 598.5
subsection 1, paragraph G,

1:18:11.601 --> 1:18:13.403
which states,

1:18:13.436 --> 1:18:17.273
"The trial petitioner must
present satisfactory evidence

1:18:17.306 --> 1:18:20.243
that there has been a breakdown
of the marriage relationship

1:18:20.276 --> 1:18:23.312
and that there remains
no reasonable likelihood

1:18:23.346 --> 1:18:25.314
that the marriage
can be preserved."

1:18:25.348 --> 1:18:27.583
Now, in light
of the fact that

1:18:27.617 --> 1:18:32.822
petitioner Sarah Lambert has
not provided such evidence,

1:18:32.855 --> 1:18:36.559
I ask the court that may she
provide this evidence now?

1:18:37.694 --> 1:18:38.961
All right.

1:18:38.996 --> 1:18:41.597
I'll allow it, but make
it quick, Counselor.

1:18:41.631 --> 1:18:42.899
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:18:42.932 --> 1:18:45.802
Mrs. Lambert, if you will.

1:18:55.645 --> 1:18:58.414
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do.

1:18:58.448 --> 1:19:01.884
Simply explain to the court
why your marriage is so broke

1:19:01.918 --> 1:19:04.754
that you feel it is
not worth your time

1:19:04.787 --> 1:19:06.789
or effort to repair it.

1:19:06.823 --> 1:19:08.391
Nothing good
is coming out of this.

1:19:08.424 --> 1:19:12.328
Well, I wouldn't exactly
put it like that.

1:19:13.063 --> 1:19:15.498
Well, how would you put it,
Mrs. Lambert?

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.468
Was there adultery?

1:19:18.501 --> 1:19:19.769
No, never.

1:19:19.802 --> 1:19:23.873
Were either you or
Mr. Lambert sentenced to prison?

1:19:23.906 --> 1:19:25.908
Is there allegations
of abuse?

1:19:25.942 --> 1:19:28.745
What? No, you
have it all wrong.

1:19:28.778 --> 1:19:32.281
Oh. I've got it
all wrong.

1:19:32.315 --> 1:19:34.617
Well, then enlighten us,
Mrs. Lambert.

1:19:35.618 --> 1:19:38.654
Please explain to us
why we're all here today.

1:19:46.763 --> 1:19:48.931
I felt so alone.

1:19:48.965 --> 1:19:50.700
Hmm.

1:19:51.801 --> 1:19:53.903
And you thought by
divorcing your husband,

1:19:53.936 --> 1:19:56.572
that's gonna make you
feel less alone?

1:19:56.606 --> 1:20:01.511
No, I just wanted Brent
to prioritize our marriage

1:20:01.544 --> 1:20:05.648
and make me feel important as
much as the kids and his job.

1:20:05.681 --> 1:20:09.385
And you thought by
nagging him, by blaming him,

1:20:09.418 --> 1:20:11.721
by withholding your love
and support for him...

1:20:11.754 --> 1:20:15.625
Mr. Marshall,
I find your tone unnecessarily hostile.

1:20:15.658 --> 1:20:19.395
- I just wanted him to...
- To what, Mrs. Lambert? To what?

1:20:21.031 --> 1:20:22.832
- Just to...
- To stand up.

1:20:27.603 --> 1:20:30.506
She just wanted me
to stand up for us.

1:20:31.841 --> 1:20:35.045
And don't ever talk to
my wife like that again.

1:20:35.078 --> 1:20:36.546
Mr. Lambert.

1:20:37.981 --> 1:20:39.482
Your Honor, I...

1:20:39.515 --> 1:20:44.821
I thought the value of a man
was measured by

1:20:44.854 --> 1:20:49.692
how hard he worked and how quickly
he climbed the ladder of success.

1:20:52.595 --> 1:20:56.599
But what's funny is as soon as
I got kicked off that ladder,

1:20:56.632 --> 1:21:01.604
the only thing I could think
about was... my wife and kids.

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:07.410
Last night wasn't
a trip down memory lane.

1:21:08.011 --> 1:21:09.979
Our kids were trying
to remind me,

1:21:10.013 --> 1:21:13.516
reminds us,
of... the love we had.

1:21:15.152 --> 1:21:18.921
And... the love that we've
taken for granted.

1:21:20.423 --> 1:21:23.359
And the love that's still
there to be rediscovered.

1:21:36.672 --> 1:21:38.407
From the moment
I saw you...

1:21:39.508 --> 1:21:41.477
it was love
at first sight.

1:21:43.512 --> 1:21:44.982
You're my everything.

1:21:47.817 --> 1:21:50.586
And I do remember what
I said to you that night.

1:21:52.055 --> 1:21:54.490
"Do you believe
in miracles?"

1:21:59.795 --> 1:22:00.930
I do.

1:22:05.102 --> 1:22:06.802
I do!

1:22:08.938 --> 1:22:10.406
Yes!

1:22:11.141 --> 1:22:13.509
Order! Order!

1:22:14.077 --> 1:22:16.046
- I knew it!
- Order!

1:22:16.079 --> 1:22:17.847
- We did it!
- Yay!

1:22:19.615 --> 1:22:21.684
- Let's go home.
- Yes.

1:22:21.717 --> 1:22:23.120
I knew
we could do it!

1:22:23.153 --> 1:22:25.022
Well, it looks
like I saved...

1:22:25.055 --> 1:22:27.991
Yeah, whatever.

1:22:28.025 --> 1:22:29.792
Case dismissed!

1:22:29.825 --> 1:22:34.064
And I don't want to ever
see any of you again!

1:22:34.097 --> 1:22:35.498
Bye, guys!

1:22:35.531 --> 1:22:37.067
I'll call you later.

1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:39.669
If this gets out,
we're ruined.

1:22:39.702 --> 1:22:40.803
Finished.

1:22:40.836 --> 1:22:43.706
<i>And that's how we
became one happy family!</i>

1:22:44.274 --> 1:22:45.808
Hey, hey, Paul.

1:22:45.841 --> 1:22:48.644
<i>Mr. Marshall started helping
Uncle Paul at his place.</i>

1:22:48.678 --> 1:22:50.546
<i>We thought
that was a really good idea</i>

1:22:50.579 --> 1:22:52.949
<i>since Uncle Paul
really needed the help.</i>

1:22:52.983 --> 1:22:55.785
<i>And he was
running out of Band-Aids!</i>

1:22:55.818 --> 1:22:56.519
Ah!

1:22:56.552 --> 1:22:58.521
- It hurts.
- Yeah.

1:22:58.554 --> 1:23:00.923
<i>Dad finally
got his promotion.</i>

1:23:00.957 --> 1:23:04.527
<i>His boss was not
very happy about that.</i>

1:23:06.029 --> 1:23:07.030
Great.

1:23:07.930 --> 1:23:09.699
<i>Mr. Marshall
surprised Bianca</i>

1:23:09.732 --> 1:23:11.701
<i>and got her a coffeemaker!</i>

1:23:11.734 --> 1:23:12.802
Ah!

1:23:12.835 --> 1:23:15.138
<i>Business was really
picking up for them.</i>

1:23:15.172 --> 1:23:17.640
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

1:23:18.741 --> 1:23:21.577
<i>And here we are,
our first dinner together,</i>

1:23:21.610 --> 1:23:23.612
<i>where we all just laughed.</i>

1:23:23.646 --> 1:23:25.248
<i>Dad told corny jokes,</i>

1:23:25.282 --> 1:23:27.117
<i>and Mom just couldn't
stop smiling.</i>

1:23:27.150 --> 1:23:30.053
<i>And that bread was
really, really good bread.</i>

1:23:34.757 --> 1:23:36.692
Oh, look,
Uncle Paul's waking up.

1:23:38.761 --> 1:23:40.596
Okay, guys,
we have to go.

1:23:40.629 --> 1:23:42.299
<i>But we'll have a session next week.
Same time.</i>

1:23:42.332 --> 1:23:44.867
Bye!

1:23:45.901 --> 1:23:47.070
That was fun.

1:23:47.104 --> 1:23:48.105
Yeah.

1:23:53.310 --> 1:23:55.778
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Mr. Marshall?

1:23:55.811 --> 1:23:58.048
I think I have a few
more clients for you.

1:24:03.186 --> 1:24:05.322
Mark.

1:24:05.355 --> 1:24:07.890
We should just do
what I came here to do.

1:24:09.925 --> 1:24:10.926
Hot buns!

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:12.695
- That was me?
- On the oven.

1:24:12.728 --> 1:24:14.697
You can meet with
your brother for the...

1:24:14.730 --> 1:24:16.766
That would be the doorknob.

1:24:16.799 --> 1:24:18.168
We're still
in the room!

1:24:18.201 --> 1:24:20.170
We're never invisible!

1:24:23.773 --> 1:24:25.275
Why is he laughing?

1:24:25.308 --> 1:24:28.011
"We're never invisible"!
So cute.

1:24:36.086 --> 1:24:38.255
- Ryan.
- Hmm?

1:24:40.856 --> 1:24:43.592
Sorry. I was concentrating
not to smile,

1:24:43.626 --> 1:24:45.861
and then I totally
forgot my line.

1:24:53.836 --> 1:24:58.574
Oh. Okay.

1:24:59.842 --> 1:25:02.345
- Is this potable water?
- Absolutely.

1:25:02.379 --> 1:25:06.183
- Here we go. Ready?
- Are we done with this scene yet?

1:25:06.216 --> 1:25:07.650
We should be.

1:25:07.683 --> 1:25:09.352
Oh. Yeah,
that was mine.

1:25:12.855 --> 1:25:13.856
Oop.

1:25:14.224 --> 1:25:15.591
Whoa, whoa.

1:25:18.195 --> 1:25:19.829
That's too far.

1:25:19.862 --> 1:25:22.365
Provided, of course, that the legiti...
Uh, legiti...

1:25:22.399 --> 1:25:24.000
Provided that the litigants

1:25:24.034 --> 1:25:27.270
can provide satisfactory
evidence to that end,

1:25:27.304 --> 1:25:28.704
of course.

1:25:32.808 --> 1:25:34.377
I know. I'm snoopy.

1:25:34.411 --> 1:25:36.379
Oh! Uh, where
are we going from?

1:25:42.452 --> 1:25:44.687
It didn't seem odd?
Are you kidding?

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:45.989
Better than that
low-flying airplane

1:25:46.022 --> 1:25:47.890
that's gonna attack
at any minute.

1:25:49.758 --> 1:25:51.894
That's not
important.

1:25:55.965 --> 1:25:58.834
Hold on, I forgot my...

1:25:58.868 --> 1:26:00.270
What's an affair?

1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:05.774
Is that what you say
to a person,

1:26:05.808 --> 1:26:08.178
when, like, especially,
"Your hair's looking clunky."

1:26:08.211 --> 1:26:10.247
I'm glad you're
not my doctor.

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:13.383
"You know what? You're gonna die here soon, but..."

1:26:13.416 --> 1:26:15.185
We need a fart.

1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:18.754
Yeah.

1:26:18.787 --> 1:26:21.391
Are you
freaking kidding me?

1:26:21.424 --> 1:26:23.692
It's okay.
It's the cats.

1:26:28.265 --> 1:26:29.732
Am I gonna go in?

1:26:29.765 --> 1:26:31.168
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:26:31.201 --> 1:26:33.236
- Yeah, I think...
- No, I'm back. I'm back, guys.

1:26:33.270 --> 1:26:35.305
- Sarah.
- Claire?

1:26:35.338 --> 1:26:36.772
Claire? Claire!

1:26:36.805 --> 1:26:38.707
- Oh, Sarah's my wife.
- Sarah's your wife.

1:26:38.741 --> 1:26:41.044
Where's the surprise?

1:26:41.077 --> 1:26:42.145
Surprise!

1:26:42.179 --> 1:26:44.147
- Oh! I thought...
- That was great.

1:26:45.982 --> 1:26:48.784
The phone has been
ringing all morning.

1:26:48.817 --> 1:26:49.818
That's awesome.

1:26:49.852 --> 1:26:51.921
Yeah! I love it.

1:26:51.954 --> 1:26:53.956
Of course I have
a plan, Blanca.

1:26:53.990 --> 1:26:55.225
Sorry.

1:26:55.258 --> 1:26:56.825
Blanca?

1:26:56.859 --> 1:26:58.995
What's going on today?

1:27:01.464 --> 1:27:03.233
Your Honor, my...
Sorry.

1:27:06.403 --> 1:27:07.803
When are we rolling?

1:27:07.836 --> 1:27:10.040
- Just now.
- Oh! And I was on the phone?

1:27:10.073 --> 1:27:13.176
- Did I get in trouble?
- That was very unprofessional.

1:27:15.378 --> 1:27:17.180
Scene 48, take two.

1:27:18.847 --> 1:27:19.949
Marker.

1:27:28.458 --> 1:27:30.227
- What do we do? Oh.
- Stop, stop.

1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:33.896
Hit the button, hit three,
hit three. Reset.

1:27:34.397 --> 1:27:35.532
I love you guys.

1:27:35.565 --> 1:27:37.200
I had so much fun!
