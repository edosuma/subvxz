- I've gotta hand it to ya,
David,

19:17.634 --> 19:19.027
it's a little unconventional,

19:19.070 --> 19:20.768
but people seem to be gettin'
really into this.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.291
Roland: Hey, Dave?

19:22.335 --> 19:25.033
Do I get an extra point if I
can bounce one of her forehead?

19:25.076 --> 19:27.862
- Yeah, we need some clarity
on the point system, David,

19:27.905 --> 19:30.081
because I've landed three
in Jocelyn's bangs,

19:30.125 --> 19:31.735
and that's gotta count
for something.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.824
- Or nothing.
- Ugh.

19:33.868 --> 19:36.392
Okay. That's not fair.
- Okay. On three,

19:36.436 --> 19:38.568
try this together,
[German accent] 1, 2, 3.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.657
All: Oh! Yeah!

19:45.358 --> 19:47.055
[Car rumbles]

19:47.969 --> 19:49.536
[Rock music plays]

19:49.579 --> 19:52.408
- So like, she's telling me
that she's going to Mexico,

19:52.452 --> 19:54.280
and I'm like, if you're not
going to Tulum,

19:54.323 --> 19:56.195
then like where the hell
are you even going?

19:56.238 --> 19:58.240
You know what I'm saying?
- So where is she going?

19:58.284 --> 20:00.938
- Ugh, god. Cabo.
- Oh my god, poor thing.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.244
- I know, right?

20:03.724 --> 20:05.160
Like, what does she wanna go
smoke a blunt with Pitbull?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.509
- Ugh, probably not.
[Girls chuckle]

20:06.553 --> 20:08.685
- Um, anyway, can I talk
to you for a sec, Klair?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.426
- Oh yeah, sure.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.473
Wassup?

20:13.516 --> 20:17.477
- Okay, so I've been thinking
about it.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.391
- Hmm.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.436
- And as much as I appreciate
the offer,

20:21.611 --> 20:21.916
...um, I think for the next
little while,

20:22.656 --> 20:24.179
I should just stay here.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.357
- I'm sorry, reset.
What are we talking about?

20:28.401 --> 20:31.621
- Um, the job that you offered
at your dad's friend's company?

20:31.665 --> 20:33.928
The junior publicist?
- Oh.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.712
- I just don't think that
I can leave here yet.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.975
- Oh, yeah, sure, you do your
bit. I'm always here for you.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.326
Sorry, I was like,
what are we even talking about.

20:40.369 --> 20:43.198
So like, Albany just put down
her dad's black card,

20:43.242 --> 20:45.766
so shots on him.
It's the least that she can do

20:45.809 --> 20:47.594
because she didn't come through
with the party favours.

20:47.637 --> 20:50.249
Breaking news,
we still fucking hate her.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.903
Anyway, do you want a shot
or not?

20:52.947 --> 20:55.123
It's Albany's birthday.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.646
- Um, I don't think that I can.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.648
I have this other thing
that I need to go to.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.085
- Okay, yeah, cool. Hey, well
text me later. All right?

21:01.129 --> 21:02.522
We can totally ditch this thing

21:04.306 --> 21:05.220
and we don't have to tell
Albany, if that's what's
holding you back?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.135
- Will do.
- Okay.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.399
Oh and Lex,
it was so good to see you.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.228
Really, it's been too long.
We can't let this happen again.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.318
- It won't.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.063
- Why do you guys have drinks,
and I don't? Hmm?
