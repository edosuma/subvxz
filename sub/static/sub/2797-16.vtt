Sorry, I'm late. I was uh...
studying. For... geometry.

00:27.333 --> 00:31.166
Mm-hm. And I suppose you were
destroying a Robo-Ape

00:31.250 --> 00:33.542
to find the area
of an isosceles triangle?

00:33.625 --> 00:36.458
Yes! Isosceles triangle!
That is exactly correct.

00:36.542 --> 00:40.792
There's no such thing as an
isosceles triangle! I just made that up!

00:40.875 --> 00:44.333
Admit it! You lied! You were off
Ninja-ing without me!

00:44.417 --> 00:50.083
I didn't lie. It's just Ninjas work alone,
which bothers you... So... I lied.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.750
-I... (gasps)
-(clinking sound)

00:52.834 --> 00:56.959
The chin-waggers at the school board
insist I conduct a Safety Seminar!

00:57.041 --> 00:59.500
But I believe in
learn-by-doing.

00:59.583 --> 01:02.959

The Three-Legged Safety Search!

01:03.041 --> 01:05.917

01:06.000 --> 01:08.041
See what happens when you
leave me hanging?

01:08.125 --> 01:09.792
I could've been zip-tied to Flute Girl!

01:09.875 --> 01:13.792

I'm your girl!

01:22.875 --> 01:26.041
The school has 23 danger zones,
all off-limits.

01:26.125 --> 01:31.041
Access them, photograph yourselves,
and return unscathed.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.041
Howard, you know
you can count on me.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.500
Except when
I can't count on you!

01:35.583 --> 01:41.291

chooses tomorrow's gym activity!

01:41.375 --> 01:44.250

all youse do something painful!

01:44.333 --> 01:47.291
-Your butts aren't gonna like it!
-(all gulping)

01:47.375 --> 01:51.792
OK, Cunningham, you want to prove I can
count on you? Then let's win this thing.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.667
We'll be heroes to every butt in class!

01:54.750 --> 01:57.208
I need to know you're with me
no matter what.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.583
I am with you no matter what.

01:59.667 --> 02:00.959
Also, I have no choice.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.875

02:16.083 --> 02:20.250
One day, every one hundred
years, for one minute,

02:20.333 --> 02:23.000
the Sorcerer Key is revealed!

02:23.083 --> 02:26.792
The key holds the power to
unlock my vile prison.

02:26.875 --> 02:31.291
But every century, it eludes me!

02:31.375 --> 02:32.834
(old-timey piano music)

02:32.917 --> 02:35.709
The Key eludes me!

02:35.792 --> 02:36.959
(dramatic orchestral music)

02:37.041 --> 02:39.041
The Key eludes me!

02:39.125 --> 02:40.333
(light-tempo music)

02:40.417 --> 02:45.583
The Key eludes me!

02:45.667 --> 02:46.875
(sobs)

02:47.000 --> 02:48.041
(techno music)

02:48.125 --> 02:51.500
Today, I will not be thwarted!

02:51.583 --> 02:55.291
The Sorcerer Key will be mine!

02:55.375 --> 02:57.917
(evil chuckle)

03:02.333 --> 03:03.917
(both) Mm-mm.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.417
See? I told you, buddy.
You can count of me.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.709
-And... Sky Carp One.
-What's left?

03:11.792 --> 03:14.083
Well, we already got the
Girls Cobra Training Club,

03:14.166 --> 03:15.583
JV Human Hamster Ballin',

03:15.667 --> 03:19.542
and the Fire Toboggan Run.

03:19.625 --> 03:23.375
Yeah! Yes, we burned all our
arm hair off. Yes, permanently.

03:23.458 --> 03:26.041
And yes, it was worth it.

03:26.125 --> 03:29.625
Sorry I got my cheese in a knot
about that whole Ninja thing.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.125
Hey, cheese happens. It's cool.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.959
Sorry, Randy can't come
to the Nomicon right now.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.792
He's busy winning a safety search. Beep!

03:38.875 --> 03:40.875
Well... yeah... I... just...

03:40.959 --> 03:44.583
Aw, come on, Cunningham!
One danger zone left and we win!

03:44.667 --> 03:46.166
This is our chance to be heroes!

03:46.250 --> 03:48.041
-Together!
-I'll shloomp, I'll vloomp

03:48.125 --> 03:49.333
and I'll be right back!

03:49.417 --> 03:51.959
No! No shloomp! No vloomp!

03:52.041 --> 03:54.834
When we win,
we can lay out all the wrestling mats

03:54.917 --> 03:59.375
and take an hour-long nap. It'll be
gym class without the gym! Or the class!

03:59.458 --> 04:01.667
Really gotta take this.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.125
Outta the way!

04:06.417 --> 04:07.875
We're gonna win!

04:07.959 --> 04:10.083
Which means you're
gonna lose! Whoo!

04:10.166 --> 04:13.458
Cunningham, I am not letting you
shoob this for us!

04:16.750 --> 04:20.875
And so it was that the First Ninja cast
the Sorcerer into a bottomless pit

04:20.959 --> 04:23.000
and sealed it
with the Eye of Eternity.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.417
The Ninja locked the stone
with a magic key.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.125
Knowing the key was too dangerous
to possess, the Ninja hid it away.

04:29.208 --> 04:33.709
Yet every 100 years, the key reveals its
resting place in hopes of being found.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.125
That time is now!

04:36.959 --> 04:41.709
Oh! My! Ninja! So what do I do?

04:41.792 --> 04:43.875
The Sorcerer Key
must be found immediately.

04:43.959 --> 04:46.750
The sunlight and the stone will
work together to guide you...

04:46.834 --> 04:48.291
Sunlight. Stone.
Got it.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.583
(grunts) Ow!

04:50.667 --> 04:52.959
What the juice?!
Where are we? Ow!

04:53.041 --> 04:56.959
N.H.S. spelunking caverns!
The final place on the safety search list!

04:57.041 --> 04:58.750
-Ow!
-That one's on you!

04:58.834 --> 05:00.917
OK, come on,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.959
the next danger zone's up there
by that razor-sharp rock formation!

05:04.041 --> 05:06.125
Yeah, about that...
Slight change of plans.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.834
I have to bail on the hunt
and go find the Sorcerer Key!

05:08.917 --> 05:10.667
What do I care
about a stupid key?

05:10.750 --> 05:12.375
I'm sorry.
But I have to do this!

05:12.458 --> 05:15.875
No, we are doing this!
We were doing this first!

05:15.959 --> 05:19.667
Hey! The Nomicon said "immediately,"
so I'm going! Immediately!

05:19.750 --> 05:22.291
Fine! You go your way,
I'll go mine!

05:22.375 --> 05:23.709
(both grunting)

05:23.792 --> 05:25.667
What're you gonna do? Drag me?

05:26.583 --> 05:29.583
(grunting)

05:29.667 --> 05:34.917
You... Have...
a surprisingly powerful leg.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.792
-(buzzing)
-(nervous laughter)

05:38.917 --> 05:41.125
Huh?!

05:42.583 --> 05:48.000
You gave Cynthia a band pin?!
How many girls have these?

05:48.959 --> 05:51.750
Ah, it's so bad... (sobbing)

05:54.750 --> 05:58.500
The taste of romance gone wrong!

05:58.583 --> 06:02.667
It takes a full century
for this brew to mature!

06:02.750 --> 06:06.458
This fetid fondue
will allow me to command

06:06.542 --> 06:11.000
whomever is under my spell
to find the Sorcerer Key!

06:12.750 --> 06:14.500
(evil laughter)

06:26.959 --> 06:30.583
Now the sunlight and the stone will work
together to lead me to the Key!

06:30.667 --> 06:32.625
I stopped listening four
hallways ago.

06:55.667 --> 06:59.125
Locker 216! So mystical!

06:59.208 --> 07:02.208
Great, you found it.
Let's mark that spot, turn in our pics,

07:02.291 --> 07:04.083
and come back after we've won.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.542
Yes! (laughing)

07:10.792 --> 07:13.959
The Key is within my grasp!

07:20.959 --> 07:22.542
No, no!

07:23.792 --> 07:25.458
No!

07:27.750 --> 07:30.500
Gotta suit up! Sorry Howard,
Ninja works alone.

07:30.583 --> 07:34.458
Uh-uh. If you cut the tie, we'll
be disqualified from the search!

07:42.250 --> 07:44.959
That Sorcerer Key belongs to me!

07:45.583 --> 07:46.959
Ooof!

07:47.041 --> 07:49.750
What're you "oofin'" about?
I'm the one who hit the wall!

07:50.875 --> 07:52.834
Uh, Ninja. Ah!

07:52.917 --> 07:57.000
That thing almost crushed us!
You are off your game today, Ninja.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.375

07:58.458 --> 08:00.250

08:00.333 --> 08:04.750
The sunlight and the stone
will work together. Work together...

08:04.834 --> 08:07.834
That's it! Its three legs are
working together.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.333
Howard, you were right.
I need your help.

08:12.417 --> 08:17.375
Oh, what do ya know?
Mr. Always-Works-Alone needs me.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.291
I'm the sunlight,
you're the stone!

08:19.375 --> 08:20.917
Why can't I be the sunlight?

08:21.041 --> 08:23.792
Fine! You're the sunlight!
Point is, I need you, brodeo!

08:23.875 --> 08:27.667
I'm in! And I'm not completely
sold on "brodeo."

08:28.667 --> 08:29.875
(grunting)

08:29.959 --> 08:33.250
Victory is mine, Ninja.

08:33.333 --> 08:37.000
The only way to fight three legs
is with three legs workin' together!

08:37.083 --> 08:38.125
Follow my lead.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.125
Not my idea

not getting the Key!

three-legged mutant band geek?

09:05.041 --> 09:08.875
Band Pin! Stevens gave it to
Flute Girl. She's crazy for him.

09:08.959 --> 09:12.000
But you know Stevens,
dude's a tomcat.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.041

09:47.166 --> 09:50.041
OK, Nomicon, let's do this...

09:52.208 --> 09:54.583
The Sorcerer's strength
is growing.

09:54.667 --> 09:59.125
You must protect the Key,
for you will need it in the Final Battle.

09:59.208 --> 10:03.333
No prob. Protect the key and...
final battle with the Sorcerer?!

10:03.417 --> 10:07.000
On second thought,
Ninja is more of a solo thing.

10:12.750 --> 10:15.500
-What's up?
-Just chillin', it's all good.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.750

10:24.250 --> 10:26.583

11:53.542 --> 11:58.542
I can't get it by myself!
I'm only one bro! Ruining! Our! Life!

13:03.959 --> 13:05.500
Ninja-time!

13:09.542 --> 13:10.583
Ninja...!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.709
OK, Cyclops,
feast your eye on this!

13:15.792 --> 13:17.000
Ninja eye poke!

13:18.917 --> 13:21.166
(electrical zapping)

13:21.250 --> 13:22.834
(all cheering)

13:22.917 --> 13:27.625
No, please, that's not necessary.
Well, OK, if you must here I am.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.208
(clucking)

13:31.875 --> 13:33.291
Yeah! Chicken!

13:33.375 --> 13:34.959
Nothing scary about those.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.667
Smokebomb.

13:40.041 --> 13:42.750
A one-eyed robot
with zero depth perception?

13:42.834 --> 13:44.583
You had no plan. Just admit it!

13:44.667 --> 13:49.250
The robot's awkwardly-proportioned
single eye was supposed to strike fear

13:49.333 --> 13:50.750
into the heart of the Ninja.

13:50.834 --> 13:51.959
Well, it didn't!

13:52.041 --> 13:54.792
Next time you're gonna try to strike fear
into the heart of the Ninja,

13:54.875 --> 13:57.083
try figuring out what he's
scared of first!

13:57.166 --> 13:58.000
That's it!

13:58.083 --> 14:00.458
I know it's it! I said it!
What'd I say?

14:00.542 --> 14:04.000
We need a device that will
identify the Ninja's greatest fear.

14:04.083 --> 14:06.917
Then we can turn his fear
against him!

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I said that? Boy, I am good.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.959
Come here!. Hey, get back here!

14:13.041 --> 14:14.792
Fine, I'll go! I'll go!

14:14.875 --> 14:18.000
We gotta get you over this whole chicken
thing! Let's go down to Charlie Clucker's.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.083
We'll split a
family pack with two sides!

14:20.166 --> 14:23.542
Howard, I'm only afraid of them
before they're breaded and deep-fried.

14:23.625 --> 14:26.917
Have you ever looked in a chicken's eyes?
There's nothin' there.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.667
(humming)

14:33.125 --> 14:34.166
Gulp!

14:37.333 --> 14:39.709
Huh. Maybe it's defective.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.000
(groans, gasps)

14:46.709 --> 14:48.583
A Minotaur!

14:53.208 --> 14:56.125
Playing smooth jazz!
On a flugelhorn!

14:56.208 --> 14:59.917
That rhino just
farted out my worst fear!

15:00.000 --> 15:01.375
(screaming)

15:04.875 --> 15:08.750
(chuckles) I have to admit,
this time, I nailed it.

15:08.834 --> 15:09.959
My latest creation...

15:10.041 --> 15:12.875
My creation! Continue...

15:12.959 --> 15:16.917
...uses an emotion sensor to determine
its victim's greatest fear.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.208
Then it excretes a primordial pudding
which forms into said victim's said fear.

15:21.291 --> 15:24.834
It farts your worst fear?
Feels like a cheap gag.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.208
You can't go wrong
with a classic, baby.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.083
Leave me alone!

15:33.542 --> 15:35.000
(groaning)

15:35.083 --> 15:37.083
-(farting noise)
-(screaming)

15:37.166 --> 15:40.166
(boy) He's judging me from
behind those tinted lenses!

15:42.625 --> 15:45.166
When the Ninja shows up
to stop the Rhino-Saurus,

15:45.250 --> 15:47.291
he'll be so paralyzed by his fear,

15:47.375 --> 15:48.917
we'll capture him easily!

15:49.000 --> 15:52.625
I love it! Not crazy about the
name "Rhino-Saurus",

15:52.709 --> 15:55.000
-but I love everything else!
-Mmm-hmm.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.667
(all screaming)

16:04.333 --> 16:05.875
(gasps)

16:05.959 --> 16:09.083
I'm you in 25 years!

16:09.166 --> 16:13.417
But you look just like...
my mom! (screams)

16:13.500 --> 16:17.375
Slow down! I can't run so fast.
I got the bunions.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.375
(screaming continues)

16:21.458 --> 16:23.875
That's... weird.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.750
What is going on?

16:26.834 --> 16:29.792
I don't know.
But I know who's gonna fix it!

16:31.875 --> 16:33.875
The Ninja.
Ninja's gonna fix it.

16:33.959 --> 16:37.542
Ooh, good. 'Cause I do not
want to deal with that.

16:37.625 --> 16:41.875
Stay back, Dr. Feinstein! I'm not supposed
to see you for two more weeks!

16:41.959 --> 16:44.250
Hope you've been wearing
your head gear!

16:45.542 --> 16:48.959
The doctor is out... cold!

16:49.041 --> 16:51.041
So-so zing, Ninja!

16:51.125 --> 16:52.291
-(screams)
-Huh?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.000
Thanks, Ninja.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.792
Soprano Sax! The most terrifying
of all woodwinds!

17:01.875 --> 17:03.875
What the juice
are you supposed to be?

17:05.166 --> 17:06.083
Huh?

17:06.166 --> 17:08.083
(farting sound)

17:08.166 --> 17:11.041
(both laughing)

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
-Uh-oh.
-Chickens!

17:20.875 --> 17:22.375
Just punch them!

17:22.458 --> 17:24.917
So awful!
Eight toes, dangling wattles.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.083
Did you know they have more bones
in their necks than giraffes?!

17:34.250 --> 17:35.959
That can't be good.

17:37.709 --> 17:38.875
We did it! We got him!

17:38.959 --> 17:44.250
They're the closest living creature to the
T-Rex still in existence! In existence!

17:44.333 --> 17:47.917
Ohh, chickens. That is some sad
business right there.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.083
Tragic.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.333
The Sorcerer's gonna
be so jazzed!

17:52.417 --> 17:55.333
(snoring)

17:57.208 --> 17:58.667
You're so good.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.083
A headless chicken can run the
length of a football field!

18:01.166 --> 18:03.041
A football field! With no head!

18:03.125 --> 18:07.375
That's right, Ninja!
We know your worst fear!

18:07.458 --> 18:10.667
Who's a good boy? Who did such a
good job capturing the Ninja?

18:10.750 --> 18:14.041
Hannibal, that is a highly specialized
piece of Ninja-fighting equipment!

18:14.125 --> 18:15.166
He is not a pet!

18:15.250 --> 18:17.667
Look at him!
Look at him! He likes it!

18:18.542 --> 18:20.792
Oh, dear.

18:20.875 --> 18:24.959
Oh, heavens. It's Stevie Miller!
My childhood nemesis!

18:25.041 --> 18:27.834
Hey, Viceroy!
Drop it like it's snot!

18:27.917 --> 18:30.166
(squealing)

18:30.250 --> 18:34.083
Quit playing with your little friend!
We have a Ninja to destroy!

18:37.125 --> 18:38.166
Geh!

18:39.959 --> 18:41.834
Clown!

18:41.917 --> 18:45.000
Get it together! You're a Ninja!
They're just chickens!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.125
Back up, back up, back up!

18:49.041 --> 18:50.959
I'm freaking out.

18:51.041 --> 18:53.417
"To control your fear,
you must embrace your fear."

18:53.500 --> 18:56.000
OK, control fear, embrace fear.

18:56.083 --> 19:01.709
Embracing fear. It's all good.
You're not feathered rats...

19:01.792 --> 19:04.375
We're embracing, we're hugging.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.125
Or you're about
to peck my eyes out.

19:06.208 --> 19:09.375
Stop it, we're all friend...
Look how many friends I have.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.000
Come lie down with me.

19:11.083 --> 19:16.166
I'm not afraid. I just conquered
my fears! Boom! Fearless! Me!

19:16.250 --> 19:20.375
There's nothing you can do, Rhino-Saurus!
I officially have no fear!

19:23.583 --> 19:25.709
Oh, boy.

19:25.792 --> 19:28.250
OK, Starting to feel fear here.
Definitely fear.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.333
Gotta stay calm. I can beat this.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.208
Giant chicken!

19:35.291 --> 19:38.041
Oh, it's disgusting!
I can see its gizzard!

19:39.417 --> 19:41.625
Oh, man, I gotta hug the rooster!

19:45.291 --> 19:48.125
Ugh! I'm embracing my fear!
And it's awful!

19:48.208 --> 19:51.750
The Ninja's escaping!
Get him!

19:51.834 --> 19:54.875
I'm riding my fear.
I hate this so much.

19:54.959 --> 19:58.625
We had the Ninja and we lost him!
This is all your fault, Viceroy!

19:58.709 --> 20:01.291
Yeah! Way to go, Viceroy!

20:01.375 --> 20:03.041
(Viceroy) Stevie! Stop it!

20:04.083 --> 20:06.208
Ugh, feathers... in my mouth.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.667
Ninja, I'm getting out of here.

20:12.834 --> 20:15.041
Run, rooster, run!

20:17.333 --> 20:21.041
Yes! Soar, mighty rooster, soar!

20:21.125 --> 20:26.333
Oh, right. The longest sustained flight by
a chicken or rooster is only 13 seconds...

20:36.667 --> 20:39.166
Hold together, baby!
Just a few more seconds!

20:39.250 --> 20:44.000
Thank you, noble bird. Perhaps you
are not as disgusting as I thought.

20:45.542 --> 20:48.625
I take it back!
That was shnasty!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.917
(grunting)

20:56.542 --> 20:58.041
(all cheering)

20:58.125 --> 21:00.667
Yes! Smokebomb!

21:00.750 --> 21:02.083
<i>♪ CluckFest ♪</i>

21:04.041 --> 21:07.792
Yeah! It's a good thing all youse showed
up to watch me throw out this nugget!

21:07.875 --> 21:09.917
Otherwise, I would've had to
punch you in the guts!

21:10.000 --> 21:11.542
Whoo!

21:11.625 --> 21:12.750
Here you go, sweetheart.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.917
-(flatulence sound)
-Right in the guts!

21:20.792 --> 21:23.041
Aren't you glad you conquered
your fear so you could see that?

21:23.125 --> 21:26.709
I am. But I didn't exactly
conquer my fear. I just embraced it.

21:26.792 --> 21:28.041
What does that mean?

21:28.125 --> 21:31.000
I don't know, man. I hugged
a rooster at 35,000 feet.

21:31.083 --> 21:34.959
I guess they don't freak me out
as much anymore. Ah, chicken!

21:35.041 --> 21:36.875
Oh, what, like you're not
afraid of anything?

21:36.959 --> 21:38.083
Nothing comes to mind.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.625
Ah! Chicken's gone!

21:39.709 --> 21:43.375
Nooo!

21:43.458 --> 21:44.667
Really?

21:45.875 --> 21:48.000
(jazz music)
