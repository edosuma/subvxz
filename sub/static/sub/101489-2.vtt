to some big‐time leg‐breakers,

07:48.766 --> 07:50.500
who knows why.

07:50.533 --> 07:53.366
So we decided
to come bail you out.

Leg‐breakers if you're lucky.

07:55.733 --> 07:59.233
‐Nothing to say?

07:59.266 --> 08:01.466
Got everything under control.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.400
How much interest he charging?

08:03.433 --> 08:06.533
Ten percent the first month,
then it goes up from there.

08:06.566 --> 08:08.400
Don't tell her that.

08:08.433 --> 08:11.066
I told you. Didn't I say?

08:11.100 --> 08:12.500

taken that loan.

up at the Mayo Clinic.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.066
And I would hazard
that our Missouri elite deserve

08:38.100 --> 08:41.666

as the rubes up in Minnesota.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.666

HARVARD:
I know what I saw,
what this is.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.333
And that is?

17:35.366 --> 17:39.466
Retribution for some
perceived slight.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.666
‐Against Mrs. Will?
‐No.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.766
Against me.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.133
Enough already!

17:45.166 --> 17:46.700
Sir, you should take
a restorative.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.300
Something for your nerves.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.066
Your blood pressure is
very high.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.200
Do you hear that?
I'm hypertensive.

17:52.233 --> 17:55.200
If I have a stroke, promise me
you'll charge them with murder.

17:56.633 --> 17:58.300
Charge who?

17:58.333 --> 18:00.633
The hatchet men.

18:00.666 --> 18:04.033
Uh, sir... you're not making
a lot of sense.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.533
Y‐You said it was a blue Ford.

18:05.566 --> 18:10.133
We had, five days ago,
in this hospital, a fracas.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.300
An incursion of undesirables.

18:12.333 --> 18:16.300
Men of‐‐ and I'm no bigot‐‐
but Italian origin,

18:16.333 --> 18:18.366
‐who I turned away.
‐Mm.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.433
And you think this is related?

18:21.466 --> 18:23.433
Son, are you deaf?

18:23.466 --> 18:25.633
We're talking
a gunshot wound scenario,

18:25.666 --> 18:28.566
combined with a half dozen
swarthy lotharios

18:28.600 --> 18:31.433
straight out of central casting,
and me,

18:31.466 --> 18:34.266
a law‐abiding citizen
of Protestant descent

18:34.300 --> 18:36.566
enforcing the rules
of this establishment,

18:36.600 --> 18:39.200
maintaining the purity
of our blood supply.

18:39.233 --> 18:42.366
Dr. Harvard, I'm gonna put you
with our sketchbook artist.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.700
See if you can reconstruct
the visage of some of these‐‐

18:44.733 --> 18:47.533
what did you call them‐‐
lotharios?

18:47.566 --> 18:50.300
I'm gonna make sure to issue
a full‐point bulletin

18:50.333 --> 18:52.533
for this blue Ford,
license plates unknown.

18:52.566 --> 18:57.100
But... it would help
if you could say for certain

18:57.133 --> 19:00.300
that the man you saw
with the gun was the same

19:00.333 --> 19:02.566
as the man or men you removed
from the premises

19:02.600 --> 19:04.566
a, a few days bygone.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.633
I saw...

19:06.666 --> 19:08.033
(sighs)

19:08.066 --> 19:12.466
I'll be honest,
I only saw the gun.

19:12.500 --> 19:17.433
Well, yes, sir,
they can be... arresting.

19:17.466 --> 19:20.600
Do you think‐‐
should I increase security

19:20.633 --> 19:22.566
‐in case they...?
‐We'll get back to you.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.666
(knocking and grunting
rhythmically)

19:24.700 --> 19:27.366
It's... no, no,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.433
you don't have to...
Just turn the knob.

19:29.466 --> 19:32.033
(continues knocking
and grunting)

19:32.066 --> 19:33.633

24:12.433 --> 24:15.266
I'm teaching him
how the world works.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.366
And how's that?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.133
It's dog eat dog.

24:21.133 --> 24:25.033
That's how dogs work.
Men are more complicated.

24:25.066 --> 24:28.600

that this was a groundbreaking

Now that's what we're doing.

You got eyes.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.266
Witness at the private hospital
saw a blue Ford

33:31.300 --> 33:33.233
fleeing from the scene
of the homicide.

33:33.266 --> 33:35.666
Blue is a popular color.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.633
You're not curious
who got whacked?

33:37.666 --> 33:40.600
You see all the black suits
when you walked in?

33:40.633 --> 33:43.033
Ladies crying
into their meatballs?

33:44.800 --> 33:46.000
And what if I said
I've been tipped

33:46.033 --> 33:49.800
to some s‐swarthy lotharios that
got jacked from the premises

33:49.833 --> 33:51.600
a few days prior?

33:53.266 --> 33:54.633
JOSTO:
Is he dead?

33:54.666 --> 33:55.633
Who?

33:57.666 --> 34:00.733
You know who,
you twitchy piece of shit.

34:02.666 --> 34:05.100
Is he dead?

34:13.533 --> 34:14.500
Boss.

34:14.533 --> 34:18.600
Boss, boss, boss, boss.

34:18.632 --> 34:20.500
You can't shoot civilians.

34:20.533 --> 34:22.533
That fucking guy
put my family on the street

34:22.565 --> 34:25.500
like we were shit on his spats.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.333
He lost his breathing license.

34:27.366 --> 34:31.266
(chuckling):
I know... but him you missed.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.600
And now I got
a wealthy socialite

34:33.632 --> 34:34.800
what eats meals with the mayor

34:34.833 --> 34:36.333
sporting a fresh hole
in her head.

34:36.366 --> 34:39.632
And, and top brass
measuring my asshole

34:39.666 --> 34:41.500
like they're fixing to move in.

34:42.533 --> 34:44.466
No, sorry, I‐I came in to ask,

34:44.500 --> 34:46.666
respectfully...

34:46.699 --> 34:50.500
I‐I can guide this
a different direction...

34:50.533 --> 34:52.065
find a patsy to frame up,

34:52.100 --> 34:54.233
but you got to lay off
this Dr. Harvard.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.500
What'd you say to me?

34:55.533 --> 34:57.500
‐We won't touch him.
‐Says you.

34:57.533 --> 34:59.800
This year we don't touch.

34:59.833 --> 35:01.766
Next year.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.400
He goes back
to his ordinary life,

35:04.433 --> 35:08.366
the fat moglie, his pot roast.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.200
Builds his model airplanes.
Forgets.

35:12.233 --> 35:15.466
But we don't forget.
We wait.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.100
We sharpen our teeth.

35:17.133 --> 35:20.266
And one day,
when he can't even remember

35:20.300 --> 35:22.666
that old woman's name...

35:22.700 --> 35:24.733
well...

35:26.366 --> 35:27.766
I won't speculate on coincidence

35:27.800 --> 35:29.500
in front of an officer
of the law.

35:29.533 --> 35:33.333
But you got assurances
this thing is over.

35:33.366 --> 35:35.066
Sì?

35:42.400 --> 35:44.433
(knocking and grunting
rhythmically)

36:02.700 --> 36:04.333
Bang.

36:04.366 --> 36:06.433
ORAETTA:
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Cosmopolis.

36:08.433 --> 36:13.066
Oh... good morning.

36:14.666 --> 36:18.366
It's Nurse Mayflower again.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.200
How are we feeling
this fine day?

36:21.233 --> 36:23.500
‐I...
‐Hmm?

36:23.533 --> 36:27.200
Oh. Well, a crisp fall Tuesday
is what it is.

36:27.233 --> 36:28.366
Gobble, gobble.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.133
(chuckles)
Almost Thanksgiving.

36:31.166 --> 36:34.100
Do Greek people celebrate that?
Turkey Day?

36:38.800 --> 36:40.766
Hmm?

36:40.800 --> 36:43.800
Oh, you poor soul.

36:43.833 --> 36:47.366
You, your body
is just working so hard

36:47.400 --> 36:49.100
to pump that blood around.

36:49.133 --> 36:51.133
Your old daft heart.
It's not doing its job, is it?

36:51.166 --> 36:53.766
‐It's a bad heart,
bad, bad, bad.
‐(slap)

37:01.533 --> 37:05.466
Yeah.
And here the doctors say...

37:05.500 --> 37:09.233
there's just not much
they can do. (sighs)

37:09.266 --> 37:13.100
Mean old doctors.
(blows raspberry)

37:13.133 --> 37:15.100
But Oraetta's here,
and she can help.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.133
You want Oraetta's help, right?

37:17.166 --> 37:19.100
‐Take the pain away?
‐Yeah.

37:19.133 --> 37:20.333
Yeah, yeah.

37:20.366 --> 37:22.200
Of course you do.

37:22.233 --> 37:26.100
Life's hard enough without
a lamb shank for a heart.

37:26.133 --> 37:28.500
Don't you worry.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.066
Your angel of mercy has arrived.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.300
SNEET:
It's, well...

37:48.333 --> 37:50.766
I have to say, Nurse Mayflower,

37:50.800 --> 37:55.100
highly irregular.
Highly...

37:55.133 --> 37:58.566
not good is, well, what it is.

37:58.600 --> 38:03.433
Such a high dosage of...
not even the proper medication.

38:03.466 --> 38:07.566
Resulting in...
certain death, which‐‐

38:07.600 --> 38:10.233
we can't have that.

38:10.266 --> 38:12.233
Patients come to us for care.

38:12.266 --> 38:15.766
Top quality care.
Not to be... mismanaged.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.466
Mr. Sneet, believe me,
no one's more embarrassed

38:18.500 --> 38:21.466
than little ole me.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.100
But at the same time,
have you seen their handwriting?

38:24.133 --> 38:25.600
The doctors? Hmm.

38:25.633 --> 38:28.700
Like a cave painting
with a stick.

38:28.733 --> 38:30.766
‐N‐N‐Not, not that I‐I...
‐This isn't, I hate to say,

38:30.800 --> 38:35.466
the first time we've
had concerns about your care.

38:37.266 --> 38:39.633
The level of care.

38:39.666 --> 38:43.700
Patients passing untimely
or rushed to the ICU

38:43.733 --> 38:47.433
without biological provocation.

38:47.466 --> 38:51.366
Not to mention the pharmacist
has noticed some discrepancies

38:51.400 --> 38:54.600
in medicines requested
and medicines removed

38:54.633 --> 38:57.566
over the last few...

38:57.600 --> 39:00.066
Requests made by you.

39:01.533 --> 39:06.233
In summation, after
the latest unpleasantness,

39:06.266 --> 39:10.333
I don't see how
we can keep you on staff.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.266
I'm saying you're fired.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.600
I see how it is.

39:23.066 --> 39:26.100
Yes. So, if you could

39:26.133 --> 39:28.566
‐clear out your locker...
‐A cover‐up.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.200
Uh...

39:30.233 --> 39:33.733
An incompetence of doctors.
(scoffs)

39:33.766 --> 39:36.333
A few lost souls, and someone's
got to pay the piper,

39:36.366 --> 39:37.633
so old Oraetta's made the goat.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.600
Well, I am no goat, Mr. Sneet.

39:39.633 --> 39:41.600
Oraetta Mayflower,
she is no goat.

39:41.633 --> 39:43.333
‐Now, Nurse...
‐Call the police,
you're so concerned

39:43.366 --> 39:44.633
about malfeasance.

39:44.666 --> 39:47.333
About medicines removed
without dotted I's.

39:47.366 --> 39:48.633
Heck, pick up the phone,

39:48.666 --> 39:50.433
tell them to send
the paddy wagon.

39:50.466 --> 39:52.600
Take this woman away
in silver bracelets.

39:52.633 --> 39:54.500
Or what about
call the news boys?

39:54.533 --> 39:58.100
‐Now, hold on,
there's no need...
‐This is America, sir,

39:58.133 --> 40:00.100
last time I checked,
not Soviet Russia,

40:00.133 --> 40:01.633
where a man gets rationed
a quarter potato

40:01.666 --> 40:03.333
and has no rights under the law.

40:03.366 --> 40:06.366
And here's you, sitting
like judge and executioner,

40:06.400 --> 40:09.600
tossing old Oraetta
on the bone pile, and for what?

40:09.633 --> 40:11.333
The inability
to read the handwriting

40:11.366 --> 40:14.033
of what appears to be
an epileptic?

40:18.066 --> 40:19.600
Miss Mayflower...

40:20.633 --> 40:23.200
Nurse Mayflower...

40:23.233 --> 40:25.500
I'd be happy to...

40:25.533 --> 40:28.466

severance sound?

40:30.366 --> 40:31.633
Three months.

40:31.666 --> 40:33.200
I'll...

40:35.233 --> 40:38.066
I can offer two, and of course

40:38.100 --> 40:39.633
a glowing recommendation

40:39.666 --> 40:42.166
‐to your next
potential employer.
‐In writing.

40:49.666 --> 40:52.600
I have to say, Mr. Sneet,
I'm disappointed

40:52.633 --> 40:54.766
in this institution.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.333
In you.

40:56.366 --> 40:58.366
When our days are at an end,
and we stand

40:58.400 --> 41:00.466
before the Lord,
he will weigh the color

41:00.500 --> 41:03.200
of our immortal souls
and judge us lacking,

41:03.233 --> 41:05.466
have we not shown
an unflagging commitment

41:05.500 --> 41:07.766
to excellence in his name.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.066
And if we have failed
in our devotion to him,

41:11.100 --> 41:14.433
then you and I are going
straight to the hot place.

41:15.333 --> 41:16.766
And Oraetta Mayflower

41:16.800 --> 41:19.066
has no intention
of sweating out eternity

41:19.100 --> 41:21.066
at the end
of the devil's pitchfork.
