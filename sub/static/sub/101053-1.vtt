WEBVTT

01:07.742 --> 01:09.953
<i>Her name was Fanny Lye.</i>

01:11.538 --> 01:13.790
<i>But she weren't the same woman then.</i>

01:19.629 --> 01:22.507
<i>She'd only known the land, the toil,</i>

01:23.425 --> 01:24.968
<i>and the war, of course,</i>

01:25.719 --> 01:28.179
<i>washing over her like waves of fire.</i>

01:31.683 --> 01:32.767
Horse's arse!

01:45.572 --> 01:47.991
<i>Her husband, Captain John,</i>

01:48.867 --> 01:51.828
<i>he came in '46 with Cromwell's army.</i>

01:52.871 --> 01:54.748
<i>Bought her master's farm at auction.</i>

01:55.790 --> 01:57.751
<i>Soon had more than he bargained for.</i>

02:01.421 --> 02:03.548
<i>There was a kind of love between 'em.</i>

02:04.132 --> 02:06.426
<i>Some shared affection, I suppose.</i>

02:07.385 --> 02:10.639
<i>Though the Captain's first love
was the Holy Book,</i>

02:10.680 --> 02:14.434
<i>an 'abit he acquired in his youth
adventuring for the Dutch.</i>

02:19.856 --> 02:23.860
<i>In '49, the war was done,
and the King, he lost his head.</i>

02:24.527 --> 02:28.239
<i>It seemed to us that anything
was possible, for a time.</i>

02:29.991 --> 02:33.536
<i>For Fanny, though,
the seasons came and went.</i>

02:33.578 --> 02:38.708
<i>Blackhill Farm, from eastern hedge
to western wood, was her world.</i>

02:42.379 --> 02:45.131
<i>Till the day the strangers came.</i>

02:48.468 --> 02:51.096
<i>Turned that whole world upside down,</i>

02:53.890 --> 02:57.435
<i>and delivered Fanny Lye from one life...</i>

03:03.858 --> 03:05.235
<i>into the next.</i>

03:12.158 --> 03:13.910
Whoa. Whoa.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.587
<i>Captain John, he'd planted
a special crop inside her belly,</i>

03:24.629 --> 03:27.966
<i>a boy who grew as this new England
grew up all around.</i>

03:28.008 --> 03:29.092
Handsome boy.

03:31.052 --> 03:34.264
<i>Arthur, his father's son,</i>

03:34.306 --> 03:38.018
<i>too young to know the war,
he was a soft and playful soul.</i>

03:38.059 --> 03:39.978
Where's my stick?
I can't find it!

03:40.979 --> 03:43.440
'Twas where you left it, sir.

03:51.114 --> 03:52.282
Arthur?

03:54.576 --> 03:56.328
Arthur, where did you put my coif?

04:15.138 --> 04:16.932
Get a move on.

04:16.973 --> 04:20.101
- Else we'll be late for worship.
- Arthur, if you go on...

04:20.142 --> 04:22.019
And don't forget that cauldron.

04:34.991 --> 04:36.409
I don't understand it.

04:37.535 --> 04:39.621
I'm sure I left it on the chair...

04:41.623 --> 04:42.624
Why!

04:43.249 --> 04:46.294
Arthur, it's filthy! Oh, Arthur!

04:46.336 --> 04:48.338
- Do you wanna try me, eh?
- Father! Father!

04:48.380 --> 04:50.924
Hey! Oi! We'll have none of that.

04:50.966 --> 04:53.885
What do you think you're playing at,
girl? Get a move on.

04:54.678 --> 04:55.845
Go on.

04:57.681 --> 05:01.101
Never let a woman best you, boy.
Have I taught you nothing?

05:01.142 --> 05:03.979
You've got to show the Lord
more spirit than that, you know.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.355
Yes, sir.

05:09.567 --> 05:10.568
Good boy.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.075
<i>As Fanny readied for church
that morning,</i>

05:17.117 --> 05:19.577
<i>she had no way to know
it was the very last time</i>

05:19.619 --> 05:22.122
<i>her family would ascend that hill</i>

05:22.163 --> 05:24.249
<i>and worship on the Lord's day together.</i>

05:24.291 --> 05:26.293
Fanny?

05:26.334 --> 05:28.920
<i>Instead, her mind turned
to a verse of Scripture</i>

05:28.962 --> 05:30.839
<i>learned her as a child.</i>

05:30.880 --> 05:36.052
<i>"Bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things,</i>

05:36.094 --> 05:38.179
<i>endures all things."</i>

05:45.478 --> 05:49.149
<i>♪ My God deliver me</i>

05:49.190 --> 05:55.196
<i>♪ From those that are mine enemies</i>

05:55.822 --> 05:59.618
<i>♪ And do thou me defend</i>

05:59.659 --> 06:05.415
<i>♪ From those that up against me rise</i>

06:05.874 --> 06:07.125
Come on, Arthur.

06:07.167 --> 06:12.255
<i>♪ Do thou deliver me from them</i>

06:12.297 --> 06:17.218
<i>♪ That work iniquity</i>

06:17.260 --> 06:22.515
<i>♪ And give me safety from the men</i>

06:22.557 --> 06:26.311
<i>♪ Of bloody cruelty...</i>

07:54.441 --> 07:56.568
<i>The sermon was the usual sort,</i>

07:56.610 --> 08:01.406
<i>and Fanny headed home thinking more
of what to sup than any lesson learned.</i>

08:01.448 --> 08:04.200
<i>Then the farm came into view
and John said...</i>

08:04.242 --> 08:05.994
Did you leave that fire burning?

08:06.036 --> 08:07.621
I don't reckon.

08:16.338 --> 08:19.424
<i>Had they turned back round
and sought the Constable,</i>

08:19.466 --> 08:21.843
<i>as in hindsight would've been wise,</i>

08:21.885 --> 08:25.388
<i>who can say how Fanny's life
might've worked out different?</i>

08:26.765 --> 08:31.603
<i>But there is a strange attraction
held by danger... and the unknown.</i>

08:41.404 --> 08:42.613
Come on. Good lad.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.603
Who goes there?

12:00.645 --> 12:01.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa, sir.

12:01.813 --> 12:03.648
Begging your pardon.
I don't mean no harm.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.403
What the devil are you doing
in my barn, eh?

12:08.445 --> 12:11.323
Why, you arrant thief!
Those are my clothes you're wearing!

12:11.364 --> 12:13.241
I'll teach thee manners!

12:19.164 --> 12:21.291
Please, sir, begging your pardon.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.752
I'll send thee back to Satan!

12:23.793 --> 12:25.545
Sir, if you give me
a chance to speak.

12:25.587 --> 12:26.838
We was beset upon the road.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.716
Do you believe you can dance
into a man's farm and make like home?

12:29.758 --> 12:31.468
A man's home is his castle!

12:31.509 --> 12:32.969
I've every right to put you down.

12:33.011 --> 12:34.846
Please, my wife, sir. Please, my wife.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.182
- I can explain.
- Let him speak, sir.

12:49.027 --> 12:50.487
Well, stop babbling, boy.

12:50.528 --> 12:52.155
What's this about a wife?

12:52.197 --> 12:53.823
My wife, sir, er...

12:55.617 --> 12:56.743
You see,

12:57.869 --> 13:01.873
last eve, we was travelling
on the road to Gloucester,

13:01.915 --> 13:05.085
headed from there to Bristol
and a boat to the New World.

13:05.126 --> 13:08.004
We was carrying all our savings,
all we had in the world,

13:08.046 --> 13:10.632
looking to make a fresh start, see?
A new beginning.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.219
But alas, it was not to be.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.639
You see, as the dusk fell,

13:17.681 --> 13:19.975
we was beset
by villainous highwaymen.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.686
It's a true misfortune, woe betold.

13:22.727 --> 13:25.480
They stripped us of all we had,
our horses, every last groat,

13:25.522 --> 13:28.692
down to the shoes on our feet
and the shirts on our backs.

13:28.733 --> 13:32.070
Since then, we've been moving all night,
sir, no idea where we was headed,

13:32.112 --> 13:35.991
when we comes upon this fine home,
quite by chance, like.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.661
Well, if there'd been an answer
when I'd knocked but...

13:39.703 --> 13:42.330
My wife, sir,
she's exhausted and cold and...

13:43.290 --> 13:44.666
she couldn't take it no more.

13:44.708 --> 13:47.544
And without clothes, you understand.

13:48.586 --> 13:52.132
And I am sorry for the liberty, sir.
Truly, I am.

13:52.173 --> 13:54.884
Never would I wish
to impose upon another.

13:54.926 --> 13:58.597
But... given these rare
and unhappy circumstances,

13:59.514 --> 14:02.267
we was left with no other choice
in the matter.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.935
Where's your wife now?

14:03.977 --> 14:08.690
She's, er... she's resting
up there in the perch. Apologies.

14:09.858 --> 14:11.276
Fanny?

14:21.036 --> 14:22.746
You be careful now.

14:34.799 --> 14:36.426
Come and look, sir.

14:47.771 --> 14:49.898
Arthur? Give me my stick.

14:56.321 --> 14:58.281
You try it, anything,

14:58.323 --> 15:00.075
and I'll slit your gullet
from ear to ear

15:00.116 --> 15:02.202
- before you can draw breath.
- Understood, sir.

15:02.243 --> 15:04.579
- I promise, my intentions is fair.
- Yeah.

15:12.087 --> 15:13.755
You sure she's not sick?

15:14.547 --> 15:17.342
No. Just exhausted,
like I told it.

15:31.439 --> 15:33.149
Well, she looks healthy enough.

15:33.775 --> 15:35.610
It's like I told it.

15:35.652 --> 15:38.280
You watch where you feast your eyes,
John Lye.

15:38.321 --> 15:40.073
You mind your mouth, girl.

15:41.491 --> 15:43.702
Them marks might turn nasty.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.413
- I'll go make up a salve.
- That's awful good of you, ma'am.

15:46.454 --> 15:48.832
- Be much appreciated.
- Go on, now.

16:04.723 --> 16:09.227
- What's your name, boy?
- Thomas Ashbury. Pleased to meet you.

16:09.853 --> 16:11.313
Newlyweds, are you?

16:11.354 --> 16:14.107
Aye. Well, yeah,
we been married four month.

16:20.739 --> 16:22.157
Sit.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.462
Where do you hail from, Thomas?

16:36.254 --> 16:39.549
I'm of Salisbury. Born and bred.

16:39.591 --> 16:41.134
And your wife?

16:41.176 --> 16:42.886
Oh, a...

16:42.928 --> 16:46.014
a village near Westchester,
name of Nettlebred.

16:46.056 --> 16:48.141
Husbandman? Artisan?

16:48.183 --> 16:51.561
I am... Well, I was...

16:52.312 --> 16:54.147
a travelling cooper.

16:54.189 --> 16:57.359
And a soldier, for a time,
in General Cromwell's army.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.486
Oh, a good old cause.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.989
I played my part
against the Scots and the Irish.

17:03.031 --> 17:05.241
Putting down the popish swine.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.368
You served too, sir?

17:08.411 --> 17:10.579
Captain John Lye,
for Henry Ireton,

17:10.621 --> 17:12.455
Regiment of Horse.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.541
Well, I suppose I should salute.

17:14.584 --> 17:17.169
Arthur! Come away from that door!

17:17.212 --> 17:20.757
Seven years on his service,
from Edge Hill to Drogheda.

17:21.965 --> 17:23.467
If it weren't for this leg...

17:24.511 --> 17:26.762
- Drogheda, you say?
- That's right.

17:27.305 --> 17:28.556
Come on!

17:29.849 --> 17:32.644
It was an unfortunate business,
if ever I laid eyes.

17:33.478 --> 17:35.897
I don't believe God doth view it so.

17:44.155 --> 17:46.366
Sit down, mind your business, boy.

17:47.909 --> 17:49.411
Spirited lad.

17:49.452 --> 17:52.455
Aye, well, you've got to teach them
by the Lord's example.

17:52.497 --> 17:53.999
Psalm and prayer.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.626
Spare the rod at your peril.

17:57.627 --> 17:58.878
So...

17:59.838 --> 18:01.172
to the matter at hand.

18:03.091 --> 18:05.218
We're at thy mercy, sir.

18:05.260 --> 18:07.429
Well, seeing as it's the Lord's day,

18:07.470 --> 18:11.474
and with the girl, and you being
a brother-in-arms and all,

18:11.516 --> 18:13.143
I'll allow you to stay.

18:13.727 --> 18:15.812
- Till the morning.
- Thank you very much, sir.

18:15.854 --> 18:17.188
We're much obliged.

18:17.981 --> 18:20.692
Course, you have to spend the night
in the barn with the mice.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.110
That'll be just fine.

18:22.152 --> 18:24.487
Thank you, sir. One night is all we ask.

18:24.529 --> 18:27.198
And tomorrow, after breakfast,
we'll ride on to Ludlow,

18:27.240 --> 18:28.867
which is eight miles east of here,

18:28.908 --> 18:31.578
and you can report your misfortune
to the Constable.

18:32.537 --> 18:33.913
Oh...

18:34.956 --> 18:36.791
Well, er, thank you, sir, but, erm...

18:37.751 --> 18:40.211
it wouldn't be right to impose on you
such a journey.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.048
We'll be fed and on our way
in the morning, no bother.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.674
It is no bother. Think nothing of it.

18:48.136 --> 18:49.888
To speak frankly, sir,

18:51.139 --> 18:53.725
I don't know what no constable
can do for us.

18:54.851 --> 18:56.311
Can he magic back our savings?

18:57.020 --> 18:58.813
Or our horses?

18:58.855 --> 19:00.690
No, I think not.

19:00.732 --> 19:03.735
Therefore,
I don't quite see the benefit.

19:05.528 --> 19:08.907
It isn't just yourself, now, is it?
'Tis a matter of law and order.

19:10.575 --> 19:11.826
And as the Good Lord says,

19:11.868 --> 19:15.372
"He that hath friends
must show himself friendly."

19:15.413 --> 19:16.873
So that's my offer.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.964
And we accept gratefully. Thank ye.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.632
Aye.

19:31.012 --> 19:34.516
<i>And so it was
that Thomas Ashbury and myself,</i>

19:34.557 --> 19:37.852
<i>for I was the young woman in the barn,
as you might've guessed,</i>

19:37.894 --> 19:41.314
<i>came to enjoy the hospitality
of Mr and Mrs John Lye.</i>

19:44.901 --> 19:47.988
<i>Her touch was firm but gentle,</i>

19:48.029 --> 19:50.740
<i>pulling me slowly back up
towards the world.</i>

19:51.616 --> 19:54.077
<i>I was a child again in my mother's arms.</i>

19:56.830 --> 19:58.623
<i>Then the cold of the balm</i>

19:59.708 --> 20:01.334
<i>causing a shifting state.</i>

20:02.669 --> 20:04.254
<i>Something wrong,</i>

20:05.505 --> 20:08.508
<i>be it angel or demon,
holds me in its grasp.</i>

20:14.306 --> 20:15.724
- What?
- Hello.

20:16.808 --> 20:18.226
Who be...?

20:19.936 --> 20:21.229
Where am I?

20:21.730 --> 20:24.941
You're safe now, sweetheart. Don't fret.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.194
You've been in the wars, you have.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.405
Where's Thomas?

20:30.447 --> 20:31.698
Your husband?

20:32.157 --> 20:33.950
Aye.

20:35.118 --> 20:36.161
Look.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.663
- Here she comes now.
- Rebecca.

20:39.247 --> 20:40.999
Thomas.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.500
I'll leave you two alone.

20:43.001 --> 20:44.628
There are some clothes on the beam.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.343
Thank you, ma'am.

21:00.644 --> 21:02.437
How's my darling girl, eh?

21:02.479 --> 21:04.564
- Tired.
- Hmm?

21:08.860 --> 21:10.070
Are they coming?

21:11.488 --> 21:14.908
No. No. We got away.

21:16.910 --> 21:20.080
It's just us now. You and me.

21:21.623 --> 21:23.416
And we gotta look out for each other.

21:28.964 --> 21:30.465
Have you got it?

21:31.132 --> 21:32.550
What?

21:33.927 --> 21:35.512
Oh.

21:36.221 --> 21:38.181
Don't you worry. It's safe.

21:38.932 --> 21:40.100
Show me.

21:47.357 --> 21:48.650
Thank the Lord.

21:51.194 --> 21:54.948
..a spirit of holy watchfulness...

21:54.990 --> 21:58.827
<i>We quick resolved to win
their hearts and stay a while longer.</i>

21:58.868 --> 22:00.245
Poor sweet lad, eh?

22:00.996 --> 22:04.040
<i>To hold
until our troubles passed us by.</i>

22:05.542 --> 22:08.795
<i>Thomas, though,
he couldn't help himself.</i>

22:09.796 --> 22:12.674
<i>I could always tell
when he had mischief in his eye.</i>

22:20.640 --> 22:22.392
Might I be of help?

22:23.435 --> 22:25.145
Thank ye kindly, sir, but no.

22:25.186 --> 22:26.730
"Thomas", please.

22:28.398 --> 22:29.816
You quite sure of that?

22:31.234 --> 22:33.778
Well, Sir Thomas,

22:34.529 --> 22:38.033
you may pick the medlars
from the hayloft, if you so desire.

22:38.074 --> 22:39.868
All right. What number?

22:49.127 --> 22:51.880
Now, pick only the overripe,

22:52.881 --> 22:57.636
and we need,
ooh, I'd say... 40 for the tart.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.970
Let's see, erm...

22:59.012 --> 23:00.305
No.

23:01.389 --> 23:03.308
No, no... Ah.

23:03.350 --> 23:05.185
There we are. Look.

23:11.483 --> 23:12.984
I need to get back to my roast.

23:19.491 --> 23:20.909
Of course.

23:25.789 --> 23:28.833
<i>We ought to have been hiding,
plotting our escape.</i>

23:29.709 --> 23:33.338
<i>Instead, in that moment, we was free.</i>

23:35.340 --> 23:38.718
<i>All us souls floating
in the ether together.</i>

23:40.595 --> 23:42.889
<i>When you open up
your heart and mind,</i>

23:43.723 --> 23:46.226
<i>joy and bliss are but a blink away.</i>

24:00.282 --> 24:01.700
Hey, boy?

24:02.659 --> 24:03.868
One for you, boy?

24:08.081 --> 24:09.541
It's your loss.

24:22.012 --> 24:24.222
- Thomas, what did I say?
- Shh-shh.

24:40.655 --> 24:42.657
Whoopsie! Sorry about that. Sorry.

24:43.825 --> 24:45.201
That's it.

24:45.243 --> 24:46.995
Come on, then. Come on.

24:47.037 --> 24:48.830
Get me back. Throw one back.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.791
Go on. Yeah, that's it.

24:53.627 --> 24:54.794
Come on!

24:56.379 --> 24:57.631
Wahey-hey!

24:57.672 --> 25:00.008
That's a boy! Come on, have another.

25:06.181 --> 25:07.891
That's the way.

25:16.274 --> 25:17.275
Come on.

25:26.868 --> 25:28.495
Whoops! Sorry!

25:29.746 --> 25:31.081
Come on!

25:32.874 --> 25:34.542
Prithee, peace.

25:41.174 --> 25:42.300
Prithee, peace!

25:44.970 --> 25:46.054
Arthur!

25:52.519 --> 25:53.561
Yeah!

26:03.446 --> 26:04.864
Thomas?

26:06.700 --> 26:07.826
Oh!

26:07.867 --> 26:09.494
- Arthur.
- Your boy's fine.

26:09.536 --> 26:11.329
Nothing to worry about.

26:14.291 --> 26:15.542
Captain John,

26:15.583 --> 26:17.127
truly, it's all my fault.

26:17.168 --> 26:18.420
And you, Fanny.

26:20.130 --> 26:23.174
Sir, truly, if it's a villain you seek,
then I'm the one.

26:25.802 --> 26:28.638
Truly. Sir, if I may say,

26:29.514 --> 26:31.683
don't be hard on the young lad
because...

26:39.566 --> 26:40.859
Captain John?

26:44.070 --> 26:46.364
Captain John, I... I...
really beg your pardon...

26:46.406 --> 26:48.533
- - One.

26:48.575 --> 26:49.618
Two.

26:50.285 --> 26:51.286
Three.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.246
Four.

26:53.288 --> 26:54.956
- Five.
- Don't get involved.

26:54.998 --> 26:56.458
- Six.
- He took us in.

26:56.499 --> 26:57.959
- Seven.
- We don't want no trouble.

26:58.001 --> 26:59.336
Eight.

27:01.212 --> 27:03.381
Thomas, take a walk, eh?

27:06.885 --> 27:08.136
Right, Fanny.

27:09.304 --> 27:12.599
<i>Fanny always held that John
took no pleasure in chastisement...</i>

27:12.641 --> 27:14.476
- One!

27:14.517 --> 27:17.646
<i>...believing it his godly duty
to keep them on the righteous path.</i>

27:18.813 --> 27:20.815
<i>-</i> Four!
<i>- I have never been convinced.</i>

27:20.857 --> 27:21.900
Five!

27:22.859 --> 27:23.985
Six!

27:24.653 --> 27:25.904
Seven!

27:25.946 --> 27:27.906
<i>We did not stray far,</i>

27:27.948 --> 27:30.450
<i>wary of what might lie
within the woods,</i>

27:31.034 --> 27:33.620
<i>them beasts that roam
in the shape of men.</i>

27:47.634 --> 27:48.802
Let us pray.

27:50.387 --> 27:52.889
We consecrate this meat
to Lord Almighty God.

27:53.848 --> 27:56.434
Thanks be to Thee for this food
You put before us.

27:58.770 --> 27:59.896
Enter.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.904
The wanderers return.

28:10.031 --> 28:11.741
I didn't know we'd see you again.

28:12.367 --> 28:14.035
Oh, no, sir, you must be japing.

28:14.619 --> 28:16.538
The thought of all that roast.

28:16.579 --> 28:19.499
We haven't had beef in over a month,
have we, Thomas?

28:20.041 --> 28:23.420
- Er, no, that's right.
- Hmm. Fanny?

28:29.759 --> 28:31.094
Thank ye, ma'am.

28:31.136 --> 28:33.722
Thomas has something he'd like to say.

28:33.763 --> 28:35.098
Don't you, Thomas?

28:35.140 --> 28:37.309
That's right, yeah.

28:40.353 --> 28:41.688
Captain John Lye,

28:42.772 --> 28:45.859
for not respecting
the rules of thy house,

28:45.900 --> 28:48.570
and for spoiling the fruits
of thy labour,

28:48.612 --> 28:51.615
I do humbly and sincerely apologise.

28:51.656 --> 28:53.867
It isn't me you have
to settle with, lad,

28:53.908 --> 28:55.952
but the Lord Jesus Christ.

28:55.994 --> 29:00.957
- Aye, well, that I shall do.
- Hmm. Well, come, then. Sit.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.694
Let us pray.

29:32.072 --> 29:34.950
We consecrate this meat
to Lord Almighty God.

29:35.742 --> 29:38.495
Thanks be to Thee for this food
You put before us.

29:39.371 --> 29:42.332
May it provide us with
the sustenance we require

29:42.374 --> 29:44.793
to continue to serve Thy holy name.

29:46.002 --> 29:47.003
Amen.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.255
Amen.

29:58.932 --> 30:01.768
<i>The sun,
it rose again, unremarked.</i>

30:04.020 --> 30:05.855
<i>We had been given Arthur's perch</i>

30:05.897 --> 30:09.359
<i>whilst Fanny and John slept
in separate beds, as always.</i>

30:11.236 --> 30:14.823
<i>'Fore breakfast,
Thomas helped John fetch coppice,</i>

30:14.864 --> 30:17.450
<i>whilst I lent Fanny help in turn.</i>

30:18.660 --> 30:22.497
So, Rebecca, where will you
be headed after you see the Constable?

30:22.539 --> 30:25.875
Looking for work, I guess.
I've been a servant,

30:25.917 --> 30:30.255
so I know my way around
a pail of milk or a pair of britches.

30:30.297 --> 30:32.632
Such a misfortune befell you two.

30:34.259 --> 30:35.760
Gives me the shivers.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.055
We'll get by, like we always do.

30:39.097 --> 30:40.724
Don't you worry about me.

30:44.936 --> 30:47.230
You've no family
you can go home to,

30:47.272 --> 30:49.065
help you out in your hour of need?

30:53.320 --> 30:54.321
Aye, well...

30:55.113 --> 30:57.574
I suppose Mr Ashbury's
your master now.

30:58.575 --> 31:01.119
Thomas ain't my master. No man is.

31:01.161 --> 31:03.371
I go where I likes, with whom I likes.

31:13.965 --> 31:15.717
Strange to think,

31:15.759 --> 31:19.095
back in Drogheda, we was fighting
side by side and never knowed it, eh?

31:21.848 --> 31:24.684
Course, back then, it was skulls
we was chopping, not wood.

31:24.726 --> 31:28.146
Yeah, and none that weren't
a head too tall, eh? Off you go.

31:29.481 --> 31:30.899
Wish I could be so bold.

31:32.233 --> 31:34.861
All them women, children and old folks,

31:34.903 --> 31:36.529
they didn't do nothing to me.

31:37.155 --> 31:39.783
Trampled in a bloody contest
not their own.

31:39.824 --> 31:41.076
Well...

31:42.911 --> 31:44.788
"He that believeth in Him
shall not perish,

31:45.789 --> 31:47.707
but have everlasting life."

31:52.379 --> 31:55.799
"God sent not His son into the world
that He should condemn the world,

31:56.800 --> 31:59.970
but that the world through Him
might be saved."

32:00.011 --> 32:01.721
John 3:18.

32:11.106 --> 32:12.524
I...

32:13.233 --> 32:15.110
I don't think I understand.

32:17.445 --> 32:19.155
So you and Mr Thomas,

32:20.991 --> 32:22.242
you be not...

32:24.744 --> 32:25.996
Why...

32:27.289 --> 32:29.332
Why, that would mean
you must be living in sin!

32:32.460 --> 32:33.712
Ain't you afraid?

32:34.504 --> 32:37.173
Afraid of what?
The size of his member?

32:38.216 --> 32:40.385
Afraid of hell, young lady!

32:40.635 --> 32:43.388
Of fiery hell and torment!

32:43.430 --> 32:45.223
And not to mention the law.

32:46.641 --> 32:48.268
And such talk...

32:49.477 --> 32:51.104
Oh, my.

32:51.730 --> 32:54.441
The Devil will set upon you
with furious industry.

32:54.482 --> 32:56.026
My poor, sweet girl!

32:57.027 --> 32:58.987
You'll not tell your husband, I hope?

32:59.946 --> 33:02.240
I thought we were speaking
in confidence.

33:03.825 --> 33:06.828
I must consider your eternal soul.

33:08.371 --> 33:11.291
I have to believe
it's never too late for a sinner.

33:13.168 --> 33:16.379
Mr Lye could help you
on the path to righteousness.

33:16.421 --> 33:18.798
- I do believe so.
- I don't need no righteousness.

33:23.011 --> 33:24.262
Mrs Lye, I beg you,

33:25.680 --> 33:27.724
don't bring us no more trouble and woe.

33:30.185 --> 33:31.770
I suppose so.

33:40.612 --> 33:43.949
I hope that righteousness ain't
the only thing he's skilled at finding.

33:44.908 --> 33:47.285
I... I... I don't know what you mean.

33:47.869 --> 33:49.496
Why, your husband.

33:49.537 --> 33:52.707
I'd say he's quite handsome
for a man of his age.

33:53.041 --> 33:55.043
My John?

33:58.463 --> 34:01.800
I do declare you be teasing me,
Miss Rebecca.

34:03.969 --> 34:08.014
I never met a girl so naughty
in my life.

34:08.056 --> 34:09.306
I do try.

34:23.487 --> 34:26.114
<i>Fanny kept our secret over porridge.</i>

34:26.992 --> 34:30.495
<i>A small act of rebellion
that would lead to bigger things.</i>

34:31.411 --> 34:35.208
<i>She was her own person.
I knew that now.</i>

34:50.974 --> 34:52.181
Psst.

34:53.101 --> 34:54.311
Psst.

34:55.978 --> 34:58.940
There. Hello, porker.

35:08.783 --> 35:11.494
<i>We was waiting for John
to ready the horse,</i>

35:11.536 --> 35:14.372
<i>intending to give him the slip
on the Ludlow Road.</i>

35:15.624 --> 35:18.918
<i>Fate, however, had plans of her own.</i>

35:35.185 --> 35:36.311
Thomas?

35:38.855 --> 35:40.315
Thomas, get down.

36:17.519 --> 36:19.187
Father! Father!

36:19.229 --> 36:21.106
Cease your noise. I see 'em.

36:30.156 --> 36:32.867
Keep ye calm. Betray nothing.

36:37.789 --> 36:39.916
- Friends of yours, eh?
- What's that, Captain?

36:42.877 --> 36:44.004
Stay back.

37:11.114 --> 37:13.450
No, I've never seen them before.

37:15.410 --> 37:18.079
That one on the black's
quite the popinjay, eh?

37:28.131 --> 37:31.009
Aye, if that's not the Constable
walking with 'em.

37:46.107 --> 37:48.276
Well, that's the Constable, all right.

37:49.361 --> 37:52.280
But what in God's will
is he doing over here?

37:53.573 --> 37:56.201
You really have no idea,
Mr Ash... Mr A...

37:57.953 --> 37:59.704
Why, you miserable brigand!

37:59.746 --> 38:02.207
Now, you just stay where you are
and hold your peace.

38:02.916 --> 38:04.376
I'm sorry to do this to you,

38:04.417 --> 38:06.670
but them men out there,
they mean us harm.

38:06.711 --> 38:08.838
And I can't let them come in here.
Understand?

38:08.880 --> 38:11.257
Yes, sir. Don't hurt my son.

38:11.299 --> 38:13.260
Ma'am, that is not my desire.

38:13.301 --> 38:16.346
Now, you both...
you both keep your temper

38:16.388 --> 38:17.722
and do as you're asked,

38:17.764 --> 38:19.849
and this'll all be over soon,
I give you my word.

38:19.891 --> 38:22.352
I knew you were a villain
the moment I laid eyes on you.

38:23.687 --> 38:25.522
I promised I'd slit you from ear to ear.

38:25.563 --> 38:27.524
- And by God, that's what I'll do.
- John, no.

38:27.565 --> 38:29.776
Stay back!
Drop that blade or the boy dies.

38:29.818 --> 38:30.860
Father!

38:30.902 --> 38:33.446
- I will if you force me.
- You haven't got the belly for it.

38:34.239 --> 38:35.782
I've done worse in my time.

38:36.449 --> 38:38.243
So have you.

38:38.285 --> 38:40.996
Please, sir, do as he says.

38:41.037 --> 38:42.914
Heed your wife, sir.

38:42.956 --> 38:44.541
She's got an 'ead on her.

39:06.313 --> 39:07.939
Lay it on the table.

39:09.733 --> 39:11.192
Now get back to the door.

39:12.319 --> 39:13.653
You take a seat, Mrs Lye.

39:17.949 --> 39:20.201
- Rebecca?
- You won't walk away from this.

39:21.995 --> 39:23.705
Now, you've not seen us.

39:23.747 --> 39:25.248
Your ears have heard no thing,

39:25.290 --> 39:27.250
so you just send them on their way.

39:27.292 --> 39:30.295
And make them believe it
or the boy dies first.

39:31.338 --> 39:33.715
I'll watch you hang... slow.

39:35.675 --> 39:37.177
Morning, Henry.

39:37.218 --> 39:38.386
John.

39:41.181 --> 39:42.724
Good day to you, sir.

39:42.766 --> 39:44.059
Sir.

39:45.435 --> 39:47.062
Of whom do I have pleasure?

39:48.146 --> 39:51.149
I am the Most High Sheriff
of the Council of State,

39:51.191 --> 39:52.609
charged with the suppressing

39:52.651 --> 39:55.403
of atheistical, blasphemous
and execrable opinions

39:55.445 --> 39:59.407
derogatory to the honour of God
and destructive to humane society,

39:59.449 --> 40:03.036
whether they be expressed through
horrid preach or damnable practice,

40:03.078 --> 40:04.913
so that God may be truly glorified

40:04.955 --> 40:07.916
and all might in well-doing
be encouraged.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.043
- Sir, I...
- The warrant.

40:11.836 --> 40:13.046
Sire.

40:28.478 --> 40:30.313
'Tis upside down.

40:30.855 --> 40:31.982
It is?

40:33.191 --> 40:34.693
My mistake.

40:46.121 --> 40:48.081
- All seems to be in order.
- Of course.

40:48.832 --> 40:50.792
So to the matter at hand.

40:50.834 --> 40:53.920
We are in pursuit
of a pair of licentious heretics,

40:53.962 --> 40:55.922
a young man and a young woman,

40:55.964 --> 40:59.634
who did partake in profane display
this Saturday past

40:59.676 --> 41:01.970
at a tavern less than five miles
from this ground.

41:02.012 --> 41:05.015
What he means to say is,
there was a full-blown ranting orgy

41:05.056 --> 41:06.641
at the Hopton alehouse.

41:07.183 --> 41:11.313
No depravity or deceit is beneath a man
in pursuit of coin or carnal appetite.

41:12.439 --> 41:14.232
This has been my finding.

41:14.274 --> 41:16.651
They should've closed
that den of iniquity years ago.

41:16.693 --> 41:19.404
- Didn't I tell you, Cousin Henry?
- Aye. That you did, John.

41:19.446 --> 41:22.616
Hmm. And this is what it's come to.

41:22.657 --> 41:24.200
Ranting orgy, you say?

41:24.242 --> 41:26.745
Blasphemous oaths and execrations,

41:26.786 --> 41:29.914
drunkenness, licentiousness,
swearing and sodomy,

41:29.956 --> 41:33.043
unmarried men and harlots
fornicating in full public view.

41:33.084 --> 41:34.294
Well, I'm stouned.

41:34.336 --> 41:36.212
It's them High Attainers.

41:36.254 --> 41:38.882
They preach that good is evil
and evil is good.

41:38.923 --> 41:41.051
I mean, I've heard tell
of such a thing in London,

41:41.092 --> 41:44.179
but never did I think
in our own fair county.

41:44.220 --> 41:47.641
'Tis but a fortune that these men
put them to rout when they did.

41:47.682 --> 41:51.561
Well, what can I say? I'm shocked.

41:51.603 --> 41:54.564
But let us hasten to the cusp
of this distasteful dialogue.

41:55.482 --> 41:59.194
In following these rotten escapees,
we did discover footprints.

41:59.235 --> 42:01.738
Footprints that led us
from that horrid alehouse

42:01.780 --> 42:04.032
and to your very property.

42:05.283 --> 42:07.035
What say thee to this, Captain Lye?

42:10.538 --> 42:12.457
Sir, you must be mistaken.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.294
I haven't seen or heard a thing.

42:16.336 --> 42:19.464
It's just me and Fanny and the boy
getting ready for the winter.

42:20.799 --> 42:23.385
It's a simple life we live here
on Blackhill Farm.

42:24.594 --> 42:29.140
Nevertheless, I'd be most obliged
if we might take a look inside, eh?

42:31.309 --> 42:33.687
Sir, I've given you my answer.

42:34.980 --> 42:37.524
No man comes on my land
without my sanction.

42:38.441 --> 42:40.777
And I'll thank thee
to take me at my word.

43:00.130 --> 43:04.634
Well, in that case, we have no cause
to trouble you further.

43:04.676 --> 43:07.387
I apologise most sincerely
for the disturbance.

43:07.429 --> 43:09.681
Oh, no disturbance.

43:09.723 --> 43:14.185
I pray you catch them and drag them
to the deepest, darkest pit on earth.

43:14.728 --> 43:16.646
That will be the least
of their sufferings.

43:18.106 --> 43:19.733
I may rest assured.

43:22.027 --> 43:23.028
Come.

43:26.114 --> 43:28.742
<i>Liars, thieves and murderers.</i>

43:31.328 --> 43:33.997
- Henry.
- John.

43:35.123 --> 43:39.586
<i>Course, John bought every word of it,
like a goose praying for Christmas.</i>

44:04.444 --> 44:08.073
Them men...
they ain't what they look to be.

44:11.534 --> 44:13.370
We was at the alehouse,

44:13.411 --> 44:16.247
that much is true,
but we was causing no harm to no one.

44:16.831 --> 44:18.750
And then them men, they fell upon us,

44:18.792 --> 44:21.127
fell upon us with fanatical violence,

44:21.169 --> 44:23.964
visiting terrible pain and hurt
on man and woman alike.

44:25.966 --> 44:27.926
Our friends lay dead and brutalised.

44:28.468 --> 44:30.387
Only Rebecca and I
escaped the slaughter.

44:30.428 --> 44:31.638
A likely tale.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.723
- Sir, it is the truth.
- Yeah?

44:33.765 --> 44:36.268
Where'd they find the warrant?

44:36.309 --> 44:37.769
Perhaps a witch's cauldron.

44:37.811 --> 44:39.896
That ain't worth
the parchment it's written on.

44:39.938 --> 44:41.648
For fools and feebleminded only.

44:41.690 --> 44:43.024
You knave! I ought to...

44:43.066 --> 44:45.652
Ought to what? Stick a bag
over my head and tan my hide?

44:46.987 --> 44:49.239
Yeah, I know men like you.

44:51.074 --> 44:53.118
Sir, we've done all you ask of us.

44:54.286 --> 44:57.998
Now, I humbly ask of you,
leave us be.

44:58.581 --> 44:59.624
Nah.

44:59.666 --> 45:01.376
Nah, it's not so simple no more.

45:02.168 --> 45:03.795
Them men could be out there waiting.

45:06.256 --> 45:08.174
Rebecca, get that rope there.

45:08.216 --> 45:10.260
Secure this man.
You, move, now, there.

45:11.928 --> 45:13.054
Kneel down.

45:16.850 --> 45:17.851
There.

45:19.477 --> 45:21.605
Mrs Lye, we'll be here
just a short while longer.

45:21.646 --> 45:22.939
I do apologise.

45:23.732 --> 45:26.234
Bind him tight, now.
Make sure he can't get loose.

45:29.696 --> 45:31.740
Go on. You go see your ma.

46:08.193 --> 46:09.194
No!

46:15.909 --> 46:18.495
Now you behave yourself
like a good little missus.

46:20.497 --> 46:22.040
Get away from my father!

46:39.057 --> 46:40.642
Calm, John.

46:40.684 --> 46:43.603
- I can't allow that again. I'm sorry.
- No, not his good leg!

46:59.661 --> 47:01.621
- You hurt?
- I'm fine.

47:04.958 --> 47:08.586
It's all true, isn't it?
Every word.

47:10.505 --> 47:12.757
You're a degenerate.

47:12.799 --> 47:16.052
A fornicator. A High Attainer.

47:16.094 --> 47:19.681
You use that name again,
I'll smite your ears.

47:19.723 --> 47:22.475
What, High Attainer?
That is what you are, isn't it?

47:22.976 --> 47:25.437
You and your ranting harlot there.

47:25.895 --> 47:29.649
There'll be no inheritance for thee
in the kingdom of Christ and God.

47:29.691 --> 47:30.692
No!

47:46.541 --> 47:48.668
<i>With no more secrets to withhold,</i>

47:48.710 --> 47:51.338
<i>Thomas resolved to speak his mind.</i>

47:52.380 --> 47:55.383
<i>For the prophet's weapon of choice
is not the sword,</i>

47:55.425 --> 47:59.012
<i>but words of blistering, shining power.</i>

48:03.391 --> 48:05.435
You call me a High Attainer.

48:07.938 --> 48:09.773
But the opposite is true.

48:12.192 --> 48:15.070
For I do not look up to the skies
for God or Heaven.

48:20.283 --> 48:21.493
Here.

48:22.827 --> 48:24.579
Here your treasure lies.

48:25.580 --> 48:29.000
God and Devil,
they're both serving under me.

48:29.417 --> 48:31.086
And her.

48:32.379 --> 48:35.006
And even you, Great Captain.

48:37.050 --> 48:40.845
If only you open up your insides
to earthly possibility.

48:45.350 --> 48:47.269
I can but open up the gate

48:48.311 --> 48:51.314
and point... to a New Jerusalem.

48:52.399 --> 48:56.820
A land where sin and transgression
are no more.

48:57.404 --> 48:59.322
A land where every man
and every woman,

48:59.364 --> 49:00.699
and all through nature...

49:01.658 --> 49:04.119
is shared in common.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.788
A land where Christ,

49:06.830 --> 49:10.917
the king of glory,
lies dead and buried, in His grave.

49:10.959 --> 49:13.003
- - Aye. Aye.

49:13.044 --> 49:14.713
Christ, I say, He did not rise.

49:14.754 --> 49:17.507
He died and rotted back to nature

49:17.549 --> 49:21.219
so that sin, so that all our sin,

49:21.261 --> 49:23.346
might be forgiven for eternity.

49:24.055 --> 49:28.435
So everything and every act
might become, from darkness, light.

49:28.476 --> 49:32.188
So we might learn that Heaven, Hell,
these are but earthly realms.

49:33.523 --> 49:35.567
There is no afterlife awaiting.

49:38.862 --> 49:41.615
- I know thy thoughts, Great Captain.
- Yeah?

49:41.656 --> 49:44.200
Honest words may cause
the strongest man to tremble

49:44.242 --> 49:46.286
but do not be afraid.

49:46.870 --> 49:49.164
For there is a spark in thee

49:49.205 --> 49:53.251
of transplendent, unspeakable glory.

49:53.293 --> 49:57.672
His boundless love shining forth
in you, in her, in me.

49:58.882 --> 50:02.010
If you but listen to His voice,
listen to that inner voice

50:02.052 --> 50:04.429
of love, of unity,

50:05.639 --> 50:07.641
then thou shall find true freedom.

50:07.682 --> 50:11.436
The Kingdom of Heaven on earth
shall be yours this very day.

50:16.608 --> 50:19.653
But those who deny the godly impulse,

50:20.987 --> 50:25.075
those who live by law
of priest and tyrant, beware,

50:25.116 --> 50:27.035
for a great levelling is coming.

50:27.619 --> 50:32.165
The sword of the Holy Spirit
brought forth in fire and vengeance

50:32.207 --> 50:36.962
upon all who oppose the God
of perfect freedom and pure libertinism.

50:38.338 --> 50:40.924
King Charles and the lords
have had their turn,

50:40.966 --> 50:43.343
so Cromwell and his great ones
are next in line,

50:43.385 --> 50:45.345
for they have made themselves
as tyrannical

50:45.387 --> 50:47.764
as ever the King in his reign.

50:47.806 --> 50:52.978
Those whose every care and industry
is to get and keep their God money,

50:53.895 --> 50:57.691
to plump their purse
through laws of property and tithes

50:57.732 --> 51:01.069
upon the back of the poor,
I say unto thee now,

51:01.111 --> 51:04.114
thy gold and silver shall be consumed.

51:04.155 --> 51:07.033
I, the Lord, shall come
as a thief in the night

51:07.075 --> 51:08.743
with my sword drawn in hand.

51:08.785 --> 51:11.162
And like a thief, I shall say,
"Deliver your purse."

51:11.204 --> 51:15.500
"Deliver, sir.
Deliver, or I'll cut thy throat."

51:16.710 --> 51:19.879
Sir, end this blasphemy,
I implore you.

51:19.921 --> 51:21.589
Consider the woman and child.

51:21.631 --> 51:24.634
But I rejoice, sir, I rejoice,

51:24.676 --> 51:26.511
in delivering the truth
with all my heart,

51:26.553 --> 51:28.430
howsoever it might be received by you,

51:28.471 --> 51:31.558
wishing only to advise and warn
to deliver you and yours

51:31.600 --> 51:33.768
from the coming plague and fire.

51:33.810 --> 51:37.731
And with your wicked words, you do
crucify your saviour a second time.

51:39.357 --> 51:41.776
You're a very great sinner, sir.

51:41.818 --> 51:43.778
And the fire and plague
about which you speak

51:43.820 --> 51:45.697
shall be upon your house.

51:46.323 --> 51:50.869
Your bones shall lie dashed to pieces
at the bottom of the Mountain of Error.

51:52.787 --> 51:54.164
- Sin, you say?
- Hm-hmm.

51:54.205 --> 51:57.584
Sin? 'Tis but a word.

51:57.626 --> 52:00.920
An imposture of the rich
to keep poor men in order.

52:00.962 --> 52:02.339
Lies!

52:03.214 --> 52:05.342
You turn the grace of God into...

52:06.301 --> 52:07.636
wantonness,

52:07.677 --> 52:11.431
a mere excuse
for drunken adultery, thievery

52:11.473 --> 52:14.017
and all that Christ, Moses
and the Apostles

52:14.059 --> 52:15.393
have thoroughly denounced.

52:15.435 --> 52:18.146
What you call adultery, I call honesty.

52:18.188 --> 52:20.190
Honesty to the voice of God within

52:20.231 --> 52:23.526
that which, by reason,
must be fulfilled, not opposed.

52:23.568 --> 52:27.072
As by the churches and the saints,
we must awaken from our sleep,

52:27.113 --> 52:29.991
shake off the coverings,
take away the veil

52:30.033 --> 52:31.826
and discover the truth,

52:31.868 --> 52:34.996
that to the pure, all things are pure.

52:35.038 --> 52:37.332
There is no act impure in God.

52:37.374 --> 52:40.877
Love is God and God is love.

52:40.919 --> 52:42.963
And thou art fair, my love.

52:43.004 --> 52:45.090
There is no spot in thee.

52:45.131 --> 52:47.425
By what heinous, hellish, impudent...

52:47.467 --> 52:50.136
<i>It was as if Fanny
had been living her entire life</i>

52:50.178 --> 52:51.888
<i>in a darkened room.</i>

52:53.932 --> 52:58.603
<i>Now a door was set ajar,
and a sliver of light peeped through.</i>

52:59.479 --> 53:02.482
..each must answer. For you see,

53:02.524 --> 53:06.444
whatever act is done in light and love

53:06.486 --> 53:08.780
is light and lovely,

53:08.822 --> 53:13.451
whether it be that act you call
drunkenness or adultery and the like.

53:14.744 --> 53:17.872
Oh, aye, to thee, to thee, it is a sin.

53:19.040 --> 53:25.547
And for so sinning, thy imagination
will pursue thee and arraign thee

53:25.588 --> 53:31.261
and condemn thee as a drunk
or an adulterer or a thief.

53:32.178 --> 53:37.601
But that self-same act committed instead
without a grain of fear or guilt,

53:37.642 --> 53:40.979
committed instead in light, in honesty,

53:42.230 --> 53:44.232
why then, it is a blessed truth.

53:45.358 --> 53:49.070
The mind of God apparent.

53:59.372 --> 54:04.294
<i>I have since been persuaded
that not all we held back then was true.</i>

54:04.336 --> 54:07.005
Just a normal day,
going about your business.

54:07.881 --> 54:09.466
<i>But I have no regrets.</i>

54:10.300 --> 54:12.218
<i>And I do not apologise.</i>

54:13.053 --> 54:18.141
<i>For rather a mighty angel swear
than an hypocrite preach and pray.</i>

55:44.686 --> 55:46.271
What think you?

55:46.313 --> 55:47.897
I like it.

55:47.939 --> 55:50.609
Hmm, a bit dour for my taste.

55:50.650 --> 55:52.652
A sober woman's dress.

56:03.955 --> 56:05.582
- - How's that?

56:09.544 --> 56:11.296
Better? No?

56:12.255 --> 56:14.090
Adds a touch of gaiety, I reckon.

56:16.551 --> 56:18.261
You're a good boy, Arthur.

56:19.179 --> 56:21.181
Nothing like your father,
if I might say.

56:21.222 --> 56:23.767
What's that?
Don't speak bad about my father.

56:23.808 --> 56:26.061
He's the bestest man in the world,
he is.

56:26.728 --> 56:30.607
Every child thinks that, I reckon.
Oh, aye.

56:30.649 --> 56:34.694
No matter if he whips your hide
for walking on the common on a Sunday

56:34.736 --> 56:38.740
then come Friday, he's off whoring
and drinking like every man.

56:38.782 --> 56:41.826
- Not my father.
- Perhaps.

56:42.786 --> 56:43.870
See,

56:43.912 --> 56:45.956
folks, they prate one thing

56:47.082 --> 56:48.667
and then do another.

56:49.459 --> 56:51.461
That's something you learn
as you get old.

56:54.756 --> 56:56.549
Now, my Thomas,

56:56.591 --> 56:58.635
he does it like he says it.

56:59.427 --> 57:00.971
That's rare.

57:24.786 --> 57:26.913
What are you doing
with my husband's Bible?

57:29.374 --> 57:31.418
This book interests you greatly,
don't it?

57:31.459 --> 57:32.752
No.

57:33.086 --> 57:34.629
I mean...

57:34.671 --> 57:36.464
Scripture ain't for a woman to touch.

57:36.506 --> 57:37.799
Pious nonsense.

57:39.092 --> 57:40.510
See.

57:45.140 --> 57:46.600
What says that?

57:47.309 --> 57:49.102
Well, I don't know.

57:49.144 --> 57:54.274
J-O-H-N.

57:54.316 --> 57:55.317
"John."

57:55.692 --> 57:57.277
That's your husband's name.

57:58.570 --> 57:59.696
And that?

58:02.949 --> 58:04.993
- That says "John" as well?
- Right.

58:05.035 --> 58:08.538
See? It ain't so difficult, is it?

58:08.580 --> 58:10.915
You're wasting your time, Mr Ashbury.

58:10.957 --> 58:12.792
I'm far too set in my ways.

58:13.501 --> 58:15.795
You are as you feel yourself to be.

58:21.051 --> 58:22.427
I see you have mead.

58:24.346 --> 58:26.890
We do. For special occasion.

58:43.239 --> 58:44.491
Go on.

58:50.580 --> 58:51.915
Your husband...

58:53.249 --> 58:55.085
I don't like how he treats you.

58:56.002 --> 58:58.004
Mr Lye has done good by me.

58:58.046 --> 59:01.216
I was but a lowly servant girl
and he raised me up.

59:01.257 --> 59:05.720
Tell me, have you not swapped
one old yolk for another?

59:05.762 --> 59:07.889
Except this one tans your hide

59:07.931 --> 59:09.933
and demands carnal service
for the honour.

59:09.975 --> 59:12.018
Really, sir.

59:12.060 --> 59:14.020
It is the very opposite
of that you speak.

59:14.062 --> 59:15.272
The opposite?

59:15.313 --> 59:17.524
Oh.

59:17.565 --> 59:18.900
Oh, I see.

59:18.942 --> 59:21.820
By which you mean he fails
to tend to your womanly needs?

59:23.029 --> 59:26.449
- Sir...
- Well, it's no less of a crime.

59:26.491 --> 59:28.535
Which is not to say I'm surprised.

59:30.495 --> 59:35.500
Sir,... this is no fit conversation
betwixt man and woman,

59:35.542 --> 59:38.336
let alone two strangers
of least acquaintance.

59:38.378 --> 59:39.963
Oh, but I say that it is.

59:41.339 --> 59:43.466
Because my nature tells me so.

59:47.304 --> 59:48.805
- Mr Ashbury...
- Fanny...

59:49.431 --> 59:51.308
May I call you Fanny?

59:52.267 --> 59:53.435
Mr Ashbury,

59:54.394 --> 59:56.396
there is something that I feel
that I must say.

59:58.732 --> 01:00:01.026
You do not strike me as a cruel man.

01:00:02.527 --> 01:00:03.862
I see good in you.

01:00:04.904 --> 01:00:06.948
I see it in your eyes.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.408
What you see

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.704
is the eternal majesty
in each and every one of us.

01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.456
Oh, well, I don't know about that.

01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:18.209
Such matters are beyond
my woman's understanding.

01:00:18.251 --> 01:00:20.629
Who tells you so? Eh?

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.131
There's a place in the New Jerusalem
for women

01:00:23.173 --> 01:00:24.716
equal to that of any man.

01:00:24.758 --> 01:00:28.053
Why, Christ, I've seen girls
stand up in church

01:00:28.094 --> 01:00:30.305
and raise more hell
than ever I be capable.

01:00:30.347 --> 01:00:32.390
- Oh, my.
- What is it?

01:00:33.308 --> 01:00:35.268
You are new to me, Mr Ashbury,
that is all.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.728
"Thomas", please.

01:00:49.282 --> 01:00:52.077
You make a fine brew.

01:00:55.038 --> 01:00:57.415
Mr Ashbury... Thomas,

01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:01.544
if it please you,
might I humbly ask a kindness?

01:01:02.337 --> 01:01:06.549
Well, that really depends
on what it is you mean to ask.

01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:08.051
Well,

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:09.970
Thomas,

01:01:11.513 --> 01:01:13.890
ain't it true we served our purpose?

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:17.560
Mightn't you find it in your heart

01:01:19.229 --> 01:01:20.772
to go from here and...

01:01:22.065 --> 01:01:23.316
and leave us be?

01:01:45.213 --> 01:01:46.715
Still not learned, eh?

01:01:47.674 --> 01:01:50.010
We need water for the braise.
Right, Fanny?

01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:54.514
No, not you.

01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:58.101
But his leg! He can't.

01:01:58.143 --> 01:02:00.145
He can do whatever I say.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.273
Isn't that right, Captain?

01:02:04.399 --> 01:02:06.818
Unbind him. Go on.

01:02:08.111 --> 01:02:10.322
Bit of fresh air might clear his head.

01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:19.456
You'll not try nothing stupid this time,
will you, Captain?

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:23.418
Truth is, I hope you do.

01:02:29.382 --> 01:02:32.344
<i>Some resistance
was to be expected.</i>

01:02:32.385 --> 01:02:34.429
<i>So now it was time for stage two.</i>

01:02:35.388 --> 01:02:38.224
<i>Fuel the fire, raise the stakes.</i>

01:02:39.351 --> 01:02:40.685
Ah...

01:02:45.565 --> 01:02:48.151
<i>The lesson was extreme, perhaps,</i>

01:02:48.193 --> 01:02:49.861
<i>but highly effective.</i>

01:02:50.946 --> 01:02:56.034
<i>Fanny said later that she could almost
see the power drain away from John</i>

01:02:56.076 --> 01:02:58.119
<i>and enter Thomas's body.</i>

01:02:59.454 --> 01:03:01.915
<i>His spell enveloped her entire person.</i>

01:04:47.729 --> 01:04:49.356
<i>John now, too...</i>

01:04:50.106 --> 01:04:52.484
<i>He could see the changing of his world.</i>

01:04:53.777 --> 01:04:56.988
<i>Or rather, with his eyes half closed,</i>

01:04:57.405 --> 01:04:59.783
<i>one last glimpse of what had been.</i>

01:05:28.895 --> 01:05:30.563
Not so hard after all, eh?

01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:56.965
<i>The host, taken as pork and mead,</i>

01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:00.844
<i>dispelling now the power of the book,</i>

01:06:00.885 --> 01:06:03.972
<i>so that nothing might impinge
on the inner light.</i>

01:06:05.223 --> 01:06:06.683
Body of Christ.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.858
Body of Christ.

01:06:20.155 --> 01:06:21.656
Body of Christ.

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:31.875
Body of Christ.

01:06:40.842 --> 01:06:42.886
The blood of Christ.

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:54.022
The blood of Christ.

01:06:57.859 --> 01:06:59.110
Drink.

01:07:01.738 --> 01:07:03.073
Deeper.

01:07:06.785 --> 01:07:09.996
<i>Laced with 'shrooms
for extra potency.</i>

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:51.538
Rebecca?

01:07:59.879 --> 01:08:01.840
- Oh!
- You go too far.

01:08:01.881 --> 01:08:04.801
Tell me you do not feel the urge
to make one with this fine flesh.

01:08:04.843 --> 01:08:06.386
"Give not thy strength unto woman,

01:08:06.428 --> 01:08:08.430
nor thy ways to that
which destroyeth kings."

01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:09.848
Thou must arise, Great Captain.

01:08:10.348 --> 01:08:12.017
Arise.

01:08:12.058 --> 01:08:16.145
Out of flesh and into spirit,
out of form and into power,

01:08:16.187 --> 01:08:19.482
out of signs
and into the thing signified.

01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:22.734
Till thou has acted out thy sin,
thou art not delivered from its power,

01:08:22.777 --> 01:08:25.904
and may only tremble
and fear the reproach of thy body.

01:08:25.947 --> 01:08:27.488
Thou worships a two-faced Janus!

01:08:27.532 --> 01:08:32.287
Yield! For it is the Lord in you
inhabiting His secret place.

01:08:32.328 --> 01:08:34.287
Arthur, avert your eyes!

01:08:34.331 --> 01:08:35.582
Do not heed this devil!

01:08:35.622 --> 01:08:38.251
Boy, open up yourself
to His eternal majesty within.

01:08:38.292 --> 01:08:40.420
- Avert your eyes!
- He's near a man.

01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:41.587
He is no such thing!

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:44.215
Therefore,
he must make the choice himself.

01:08:44.256 --> 01:08:46.091
Cover his eyes, I say!

01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:48.636
Arthur.

01:08:49.554 --> 01:08:51.890
What say you, Arthur, hmm?

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:53.600
How does your inner voice intone?

01:08:55.518 --> 01:08:57.145
Arthur,

01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:59.395
it is your decision to make.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:00.523
Avert your eyes, I say!

01:09:01.564 --> 01:09:02.734
Hmm?

01:09:02.774 --> 01:09:05.944
I... I do believe it's way past
the boy's bedtime.

01:09:05.987 --> 01:09:06.988
Yeah.

01:09:08.198 --> 01:09:09.198
Yes.

01:09:10.448 --> 01:09:11.658
Yes, I do.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.461
Aye.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:24.171
Aye. We must protect

01:09:24.212 --> 01:09:28.134
our precious little boy
from all the nasty, filthy things

01:09:28.176 --> 01:09:31.304
going through his precious
little mother's mind, eh?

01:09:58.415 --> 01:10:00.875
Go on. Join her.

01:10:01.584 --> 01:10:04.587
Embrace the eternal majesty in thee.

01:10:04.629 --> 01:10:06.089
Don't you dare.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.927
I always knew you were a no-good harlot.

01:10:10.969 --> 01:10:12.887
I'm not in the least surprised.

01:10:13.388 --> 01:10:14.931
Come here, sweetheart.

01:10:19.853 --> 01:10:20.895
Good girl.

01:10:21.313 --> 01:10:24.858
It delights thee, don't it?
It feels right.

01:10:24.899 --> 01:10:27.402
You think I don't know
the baseness of a woman?

01:10:27.444 --> 01:10:29.321
You think there's anything
you can teach me?

01:10:29.362 --> 01:10:31.406
I don't care to teach you nothing.

01:10:31.448 --> 01:10:32.907
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

01:10:35.744 --> 01:10:37.078
Kiss her on the lips.

01:10:44.753 --> 01:10:47.047
Make one with thy flesh.

01:10:49.883 --> 01:10:51.676
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:56.056
Yield to the eternal majesty in thee.

01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:01.895
Without such act,

01:11:01.937 --> 01:11:04.105
there is no life.

01:11:04.147 --> 01:11:07.359
Without life, no perfection.

01:11:08.026 --> 01:11:12.072
Without perfection, no eternal peace.

01:11:12.739 --> 01:11:17.577
And freedom
in thy everlasting majesty,

01:11:17.619 --> 01:11:21.289
ruling, conquering,

01:11:21.331 --> 01:11:26.753
and dancing all into itself
without end forever.

01:11:41.434 --> 01:11:43.895
The Devil will punish thee
in eternity,

01:11:43.937 --> 01:11:45.772
crushing your bones,

01:11:45.814 --> 01:11:50.402
only to put you back together
and crush you again a thousand times!

01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:52.696
A thousand devils piercing...

01:11:52.737 --> 01:11:54.197
<i>The final stage,</i>

01:11:55.448 --> 01:11:57.742
<i>releasing all inhibition.</i>

01:12:04.332 --> 01:12:07.585
I breathe the spirit of God into thee.

01:12:27.147 --> 01:12:28.898
A holy relic of our order.

01:12:29.482 --> 01:12:31.026
Over a thousand year old.

01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:34.696
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, aye.

01:12:35.196 --> 01:12:36.990
It's more than that.

01:12:37.032 --> 01:12:39.993
This here's the proof
of Christ's earthiness,

01:12:40.035 --> 01:12:43.163
belying the very myth
of the Resurrection itself.

01:13:00.347 --> 01:13:02.933
You like to beat on a woman,
don't you, John?

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.602
Does it make you hard?

01:13:11.483 --> 01:13:13.151
It makes me hard.

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:30.543
Tell me you want it.

01:13:32.212 --> 01:13:33.964
Tell me you want it.

01:13:34.005 --> 01:13:36.216
Feel it. Go on, feel it.

01:13:37.217 --> 01:13:39.886
Tell me you want it so much
you're gonna die.

01:13:41.137 --> 01:13:43.265
Tell me you want my prick inside you.

01:13:43.306 --> 01:13:44.557
I want...

01:13:45.058 --> 01:13:46.268
What do you want?

01:13:47.143 --> 01:13:49.187
I want your prick inside me.

01:13:54.859 --> 01:13:56.403
All in good time.

01:14:14.671 --> 01:14:16.298
On your knees, Captain.

01:14:38.028 --> 01:14:40.822
Come. Rise.

01:14:40.864 --> 01:14:42.365
Don't be afraid.

01:14:44.075 --> 01:14:45.785
My present to thee.

01:14:51.583 --> 01:14:55.211
Years of debt that must be repaid.

01:15:04.304 --> 01:15:06.473
Steel thyself, woman.

01:15:06.514 --> 01:15:08.308
Break free of thy bonds!

01:15:27.994 --> 01:15:29.788
- - Good. Again.

01:15:33.249 --> 01:15:34.417
Good girl. Harder!

01:15:38.755 --> 01:15:40.465
- - Go on, now!

01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:43.301
Go on, now! Yes!

01:15:43.343 --> 01:15:45.053
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:15:45.095 --> 01:15:47.722
- - Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:15:47.764 --> 01:15:49.099
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:15:49.766 --> 01:15:50.767
Yes!

01:15:54.771 --> 01:15:55.897
God speaks.

01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:58.692
- - Go on! Yes!

01:16:26.052 --> 01:16:28.388
And now you're gonna watch me
fuck your wife.

01:16:39.065 --> 01:16:40.984
- No, no.
- Hey, hey, what's the matter?

01:16:41.026 --> 01:16:42.611
What's wrong? Huh?

01:16:42.652 --> 01:16:44.404
What I said to you before...

01:16:47.198 --> 01:16:49.409
I was mistaken.

01:16:50.744 --> 01:16:54.831
A crueller, more self-serving man
I have never met.

01:17:02.964 --> 01:17:04.382
Go on, then.

01:17:05.091 --> 01:17:06.259
Take me.

01:17:10.055 --> 01:17:11.890
Do what you will.

01:17:18.563 --> 01:17:21.483
I've never forced myself on a woman
in my life.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.531
<i>I'd never seen Thomas beaten before.</i>

01:18:10.115 --> 01:18:11.908
<i>It was a mixed emotion.</i>

01:18:13.702 --> 01:18:17.247
<i>After no small moping,
he resolved to leave that place</i>

01:18:17.289 --> 01:18:19.082
<i>and never speak of Fanny again.</i>

01:18:19.582 --> 01:18:21.626
Do you think we can outrun them
if they find us?

01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:23.003
We can try.

01:18:23.962 --> 01:18:25.797
I'll fight them to the death,
if I have to.

01:18:26.298 --> 01:18:27.966
They'll not get their hands on you.

01:18:29.009 --> 01:18:30.510
Hey.

01:18:38.268 --> 01:18:39.269
Wait!

01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:46.109
<i>Fanny had spent the rest
of the night and the morning</i>

01:18:46.151 --> 01:18:47.944
<i>overcome with shame.</i>

01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:53.867
<i>Neither Arthur or John
would meet her eye.</i>

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.042
<i>Her mood lifted slightly
when Arthur broke free.</i>

01:19:13.386 --> 01:19:14.721
Thomas Ashbury!

01:19:28.443 --> 01:19:31.196
Give up thy sword and come out
and kneel upon the ground!

01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:33.239
Can't do that!

01:19:33.281 --> 01:19:35.033
You'll do as I tell you,

01:19:35.533 --> 01:19:37.911
or I'll open up this whore
like autumn swine.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.665
You will watch her bleed out
in front of you.

01:19:42.207 --> 01:19:44.000
God's my witness you shall!

01:19:44.042 --> 01:19:46.044
Hold your sword, Thomas!

01:19:48.296 --> 01:19:51.007
All right! All right!

01:19:51.967 --> 01:19:53.134
Don't hurt her!

01:19:59.057 --> 01:20:00.183
Thomas!

01:20:07.899 --> 01:20:09.150
Boy?

01:20:09.776 --> 01:20:11.695
<i>The bastard had us now.</i>

01:20:46.771 --> 01:20:48.607
Rebecca!

01:20:58.575 --> 01:21:00.994
It's a flesh wound, it's a flesh wound.
It's not fatal.

01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:06.833
- Just lay very still.
- Yeah.

01:21:10.086 --> 01:21:12.422
- No, John, no!
- Harlot!

01:21:13.465 --> 01:21:14.841
I'll deal with you later.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.762
Try it, I dare you!

01:21:22.682 --> 01:21:23.892
Bind 'em, boy.

01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:27.604
Move your hand.

01:21:27.646 --> 01:21:29.105
Your hand!

01:21:42.035 --> 01:21:44.162
Enough. Constable's waiting.

01:21:45.497 --> 01:21:47.499
You can't move her.
She'll bleed to her death.

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.585
She should've minded that
'fore she trifled with Satan.

01:21:50.961 --> 01:21:52.337
John?

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:54.839
You're a good man.

01:21:55.799 --> 01:21:57.926
- Please show some mercy.
- Oh!

01:21:57.968 --> 01:22:00.387
One whore defends another, eh?

01:22:00.428 --> 01:22:03.431
Well, you've shown your true nature,
as if I didn't know it before.

01:22:03.473 --> 01:22:04.683
No, I didn't!

01:22:05.558 --> 01:22:07.686
I did as I was asked.

01:22:07.727 --> 01:22:09.354
I was afraid!

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.775
All right.

01:22:15.735 --> 01:22:17.988
Don't you take your eyes off her.

01:22:18.029 --> 01:22:20.031
I'll come back with the surgeon

01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:22.701
and a rope to hang her with
when he's done.

01:22:23.743 --> 01:22:24.828
Get up.

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:27.831
Go on.

01:22:29.499 --> 01:22:31.293
Come on, help me sit her up.

01:22:31.334 --> 01:22:33.253
Arthur, come and help me!

01:22:33.295 --> 01:22:34.379
Get on.

01:22:43.305 --> 01:22:45.056
She's just a girl, you know?

01:22:46.308 --> 01:22:48.184
Just a poor dumb girl
from a poor family,

01:22:48.226 --> 01:22:49.811
didn't know no better.

01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:53.773
You want your revenge on me,
that's fair.

01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:55.900
But Rebecca, she never hurt a fly.

01:22:59.779 --> 01:23:01.698
Ain't like you made no mistakes
in your time.

01:23:03.199 --> 01:23:05.452
Not done things to make the Lord angry.

01:23:07.245 --> 01:23:09.873
What would this world be
without a second chance, eh?

01:23:13.668 --> 01:23:15.837
You want them to hang her,
is that what you want?

01:23:16.921 --> 01:23:18.048
Really?

01:23:19.382 --> 01:23:20.967
Cos that's what'll happen.

01:23:22.093 --> 01:23:24.220
And they'll do it in a heartbeat.

01:23:24.262 --> 01:23:28.224
Not cos it's right,
not cos the Lord tells them so, no.

01:23:28.266 --> 01:23:29.517
You know why?

01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:32.270
They'll do it for fun.

01:23:33.813 --> 01:23:35.190
Cos it delights them,

01:23:35.231 --> 01:23:37.692
watching young girls swing
and suffer so.

01:23:38.401 --> 01:23:40.236
Shit herself before she's done.

01:23:42.155 --> 01:23:43.865
Aye, a right good show.

01:23:47.661 --> 01:23:49.579
You know it's that sheriff
who's the liar.

01:23:49.621 --> 01:23:51.331
Not me, not Rebecca.

01:23:52.707 --> 01:23:54.834
He ain't no sheriff, I'll stake my life.

01:23:56.086 --> 01:23:58.505
He killed them all in the alehouse,
you know that?

01:23:58.546 --> 01:24:00.924
Oh, yeah. Man and woman.

01:24:01.675 --> 01:24:03.426
Ravaged them first, like.

01:24:05.262 --> 01:24:06.638
Just like Drogheda.

01:24:09.724 --> 01:24:13.186
Oh, yeah. He don't answer to no one.

01:24:13.228 --> 01:24:14.688
Not he.

01:24:14.729 --> 01:24:17.315
No Council of State,
nor no higher power.

01:24:17.357 --> 01:24:19.150
You want the devil,

01:24:19.734 --> 01:24:21.111
he's the one.

01:24:23.071 --> 01:24:24.572
Just you wait and see.

01:25:11.161 --> 01:25:12.662
Christ!

01:25:14.414 --> 01:25:15.707
I told ye so.

01:25:18.585 --> 01:25:20.462
Their lives are in great danger.

01:25:20.503 --> 01:25:22.088
Let me up. We must return.

01:25:57.582 --> 01:25:58.833
Oh, dear God!

01:26:03.964 --> 01:26:06.299
Whoa!

01:26:16.601 --> 01:26:17.894
Unbind me.

01:26:26.194 --> 01:26:27.821
Oh, Lord!

01:26:29.489 --> 01:26:30.824
Walk!

01:26:42.836 --> 01:26:44.212
Arthur?

01:26:46.881 --> 01:26:48.925
Oh, dear Lord, no! Arthur?

01:26:50.552 --> 01:26:51.886
Arthur, boy!

01:26:53.138 --> 01:26:54.889
Oh, God, no! Arthur?

01:26:55.849 --> 01:26:57.100
My boy!

01:26:59.311 --> 01:27:01.521
Lord, no, please, no!

01:27:01.563 --> 01:27:03.481
Arthur, boy?

01:27:03.523 --> 01:27:04.816
Boy?

01:27:06.109 --> 01:27:07.736
Oh, dear Lord, no!

01:27:07.777 --> 01:27:09.321
Unbind me!

01:27:13.158 --> 01:27:15.160
Unbind me, for the love of...

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.505
Well, hello!

01:28:09.005 --> 01:28:11.383
John! John, we're in here!

01:28:16.513 --> 01:28:17.639
Fanny?

01:30:06.748 --> 01:30:09.000
Oh, soldier boy!

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.131
I thought you might like to know
that your boy died

01:30:16.549 --> 01:30:18.343
crying like a woman.

01:30:20.053 --> 01:30:21.721
Weeping in pain.

01:30:23.014 --> 01:30:24.891
He thought it would never end.

01:30:26.142 --> 01:30:29.312
But end it did, of course,

01:30:29.354 --> 01:30:31.231
as do all things.

01:30:35.777 --> 01:30:38.029
Your wife is next.

01:30:38.071 --> 01:30:39.447
I think you know

01:30:40.407 --> 01:30:43.368
the harbouring of heretics
is a very grave offence

01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:45.161
and she must be punished.

01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:51.376
But it won't be over for her so quickly.
Oh, no.

01:30:52.627 --> 01:30:54.170
And when I'm done,

01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:56.798
I'm going to sell her.

01:30:57.674 --> 01:30:58.883
You hear?

01:31:00.218 --> 01:31:03.888
Every vagabond, sailor
and leper in Bristol

01:31:03.930 --> 01:31:07.267
will have a sniff of that country cunt!

01:31:10.145 --> 01:31:12.188
Within a year, she'll die of the pox.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.941
Usually the way.

01:31:16.151 --> 01:31:17.485
- Let's go flush him out.
- No.

01:31:17.527 --> 01:31:19.195
It's not worth it.

01:31:19.738 --> 01:31:22.407
You see? He's bleeding out like a pig.

01:31:24.075 --> 01:31:25.910
Just let nature take its course, eh?

01:31:53.355 --> 01:31:54.814
Fuck me! It's here.

01:31:55.482 --> 01:31:56.775
I've found it.

01:32:01.488 --> 01:32:03.657
Feast your eyes at that.

01:32:05.325 --> 01:32:08.620
If that's not a toenail
of Christ himself!

01:32:09.287 --> 01:32:12.374
This here will bring us
seven years' good luck, no question.

01:32:14.084 --> 01:32:16.461
Didn't do him much good, did it?

01:32:17.379 --> 01:32:18.838
Yeah, well...

01:32:20.173 --> 01:32:21.841
I guess his seven years were up.

01:32:23.843 --> 01:32:25.387
Well, as long as you're happy.

01:32:25.428 --> 01:32:28.765
Oh, yeah. I'm fucking merry, too right!

01:32:31.851 --> 01:32:33.061
Good, good.

01:32:35.855 --> 01:32:37.691
Let's get him on the bonfire.

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:54.749
<i>Fanny told me that night
of my Thomas's death.</i>

01:32:57.210 --> 01:33:00.839
<i>When the grief came,
it was overwhelming</i>

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.383
<i>and remains a dull ache in my heart.</i>

01:33:16.104 --> 01:33:17.897
<i>When I came to,</i>

01:33:17.939 --> 01:33:21.192
<i>we was in the clutches
of the darkest of creatures.</i>

01:33:22.485 --> 01:33:25.572
<i>Fanny's face told me
all I needed to know.</i>

01:33:27.407 --> 01:33:31.161
<i>She would never speak
of what she saw happen to her boy.</i>

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:34.789
Sir?

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.084
Tell me,

01:33:39.711 --> 01:33:41.212
what will become of us?

01:33:46.509 --> 01:33:49.012
You'll be brought to the Tower
until you recant.

01:33:50.931 --> 01:33:52.432
Or earn your freedom.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:08.698
I have earned my freedom
more times than I can count.

01:34:13.078 --> 01:34:15.622
I'd lose the attitude
if I were you, ma'am.

01:34:16.748 --> 01:34:18.166
Is that so?

01:34:19.334 --> 01:34:23.463
It might not be good for the health,
don't you know?

01:34:24.047 --> 01:34:25.799
Oh, I know all too well.

01:34:29.719 --> 01:34:32.305
I was 17 when the war started.

01:34:34.266 --> 01:34:37.769
There have been soldiers through here
more times than I can remember.

01:34:39.145 --> 01:34:42.440
Back and forth, back and forth.

01:34:43.066 --> 01:34:45.860
Each victor claiming his spoils.

01:34:48.989 --> 01:34:50.657
My John, he knowed it.

01:34:53.159 --> 01:34:54.744
Though he never did speak of it.

01:34:59.624 --> 01:35:01.668
Ain't nothing you can do to me

01:35:03.878 --> 01:35:05.964
I ain't already suffered.

01:35:07.882 --> 01:35:09.301
Good.

01:35:11.636 --> 01:35:13.972
Then we needn't waste time
on the niceties.

01:36:36.805 --> 01:36:38.807
Persistent bugger, aren't you?

01:36:39.432 --> 01:36:40.725
Get out here!

01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:46.231
Oh, I've peed down me trousers!

01:36:48.984 --> 01:36:50.610
Look what I just caught.

01:36:51.653 --> 01:36:53.446
What are we gonna do with him?

01:36:55.073 --> 01:36:57.367
Hung, drawn and quartered, perhaps.

01:36:58.410 --> 01:37:02.205
The treasonous whoreson
deserves no less.

01:37:06.084 --> 01:37:07.377
On second thoughts,

01:37:08.712 --> 01:37:09.713
just...

01:37:10.547 --> 01:37:13.091
tie his hands up
and put his head on a block.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.053
Get on with it.

01:37:52.213 --> 01:37:53.923
Get an axe.

01:41:09.953 --> 01:41:11.955
<i>With Arthur gone,</i>

01:41:11.997 --> 01:41:16.501
<i>and with her eyes turned up to the light
of that New Jerusalem,</i>

01:41:17.794 --> 01:41:20.672
<i>there was nothing left for Fanny
at Blackhill Farm.</i>

01:41:28.471 --> 01:41:29.556
Fanny?

01:41:31.516 --> 01:41:32.517
Fanny?

01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:40.692
<i>John's pitiful calls echoing
like a distant memory,</i>

01:41:40.734 --> 01:41:44.654
<i>she finally laid eyes
on the source of all our troubles.</i>

01:41:46.573 --> 01:41:48.533
<i>'Twas not what we had held it to be.</i>

01:41:49.909 --> 01:41:52.829
<i>Just a trinket in a fancy box.</i>

01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:11.681
<i>She knew not where we was headed,</i>

01:42:11.723 --> 01:42:13.892
<i>nor what danger marked the road.</i>

01:42:14.893 --> 01:42:17.270
<i>Only that her inner light
would guide her.</i>

01:42:21.566 --> 01:42:25.403
<i>And so emerged
the Fanny Lye of legend.</i>

01:42:31.493 --> 01:42:35.497
<i>We was to travel every corner
of that fickle isle,</i>

01:42:35.538 --> 01:42:39.876
<i>hearing every last word
on the nature of the world and God,</i>

01:42:39.918 --> 01:42:44.297
<i>'fore joining the Society of Friends,
elsewise known as Quakers.</i>

01:42:45.924 --> 01:42:49.928
<i>Fanny took to preaching
and spoke her truth to many hearts,</i>

01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:52.180
<i>even greater than Thomas had foreseen,</i>

01:42:53.556 --> 01:42:56.268
<i>on the right of a wife to hold property,</i>

01:42:56.309 --> 01:42:58.478
<i>to speak equal marriage vows,</i>

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.438
<i>and be free of her husband's whip.</i>

01:43:01.523 --> 01:43:04.359
<i>Fanny's voice rang out clear and true.</i>

01:44:03.209 --> 01:44:07.631
<i>When the King was restored in 1660,
Fanny was imprisoned</i>

01:44:07.672 --> 01:44:10.926
<i>and then transported
to the colonies in America.</i>

01:44:10.967 --> 01:44:14.846
<i>I followed after and finished up
here in Rhode Island.</i>

01:44:14.888 --> 01:44:16.848
<i>We have not been reacquainted.</i>

01:44:18.224 --> 01:44:23.146
<i>Sometimes I hear tales, though,
of that fierce and heartfelt woman,</i>

01:44:23.188 --> 01:44:25.899
<i>whom I saw reborn all them years ago,</i>

01:44:25.941 --> 01:44:28.360
<i>in an England now a dream.</i>
