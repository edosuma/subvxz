00:06.548 --> 00:08.882
Oh, look, look!
There's Joey's picture!

00:09.092 --> 00:10.426
This is so exciting!

00:10.635 --> 00:13.554
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.306
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.726
The exclamation point scares me.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.228
It's not just Freud,
it's Freud!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.356
Shh. Magic is about to happen!

00:25.316 --> 00:26.984
Well, Eva...

00:27.777 --> 00:30.863
...we've done
some excellent work here.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.866
And I would have to say...

00:34.409 --> 00:38.162
...your problem is quite clear.

00:39.998 --> 00:43.208
All you want is a dinkle

00:43.585 --> 00:46.462
What you envy's a schwang

00:46.671 --> 00:50.007
A thing through which you can tinkle

00:50.216 --> 00:52.885
To play with or simply let hang

01:51.277 --> 01:53.403
I feel violated.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.324
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

01:57.534 --> 01:59.451
...to have something else to do?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.161
Ross, 10:00.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.205
Is it? It feels like 2.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.333
No, 10:00!

02:08.294 --> 02:12.172
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 10:00!

02:14.342 --> 02:15.509
Hello!

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
She's amazing!

02:16.970 --> 02:20.597
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.517
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.561
And what would my opening line be?

02:25.812 --> 02:26.812
Excuse me...

02:29.774 --> 02:32.109
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.320
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.448
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.329
But you always see these beautiful
women with these "nothing" guys.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.582
You could be one of those guys.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.418
- You could do that.
- You think?

02:49.669 --> 02:50.669
Absolutely!

02:50.879 --> 02:53.380
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.216
- I'm very aware of my tongue.
- Come on.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.676
Here goes.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.057
Yes?

03:04.392 --> 03:06.393
Hi. Um... Ahem.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.604
Okay, next word would be...

03:08.813 --> 03:09.855
...uh, Chandler.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.941
Chandler is my name and, uh...

03:14.360 --> 03:15.736
Hi!

03:17.322 --> 03:18.739
Yes, you said that.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.950
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say...

03:22.160 --> 03:24.244
What I wanted to say was, uh...

03:24.454 --> 03:27.664
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.541
Chandler?

03:32.128 --> 03:33.128
There he is!

03:33.338 --> 03:36.423
- I didn't know you could dance!
- You were in a play!

03:36.633 --> 03:38.091
What'd you think?

03:39.010 --> 03:42.137
- I didn't know you could dance!
- You were in a play!

03:42.347 --> 03:45.015
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.477
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.813
- You're right.
- We saw your head.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.565
She said yes! She said yes!

03:53.775 --> 03:54.775
Wow!

03:54.984 --> 03:57.361
Awful play, man! Whoa!

03:59.322 --> 04:03.575
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian
and she pronounces my name "Chandler."

04:05.662 --> 04:08.789
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.084
- What is it?
- The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.128
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

04:15.338 --> 04:16.505
Based on this play?

04:19.132 --> 04:21.134
Based on this play!

04:30.103 --> 04:31.186
Hey, kids!

04:31.396 --> 04:32.396
Hey, Chandler.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.024
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

04:36.359 --> 04:40.070
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.740
How was your date, Chandler?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.200
It was unbelievable!

04:45.410 --> 04:49.037
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

04:49.247 --> 04:50.914
She was in the Israeli army.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.208
None of the bullets hit
the engine block...

04:53.459 --> 04:55.836
...so we made it to the border.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.963
But just barely and I...

04:59.048 --> 05:02.968
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.262
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.347
All right, once...

05:07.598 --> 05:10.309
...once I got on the subway, right?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.185
And it was at night...

05:12.437 --> 05:15.063
...and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn...

05:15.982 --> 05:17.774
...just for the hell of it.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.194
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.363
More or less.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.949
Suddenly, we realized
we were in Yemen.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.951
I'm sorry, so "we" is?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.078
"We" is me and Rick.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.748
- Who's Rick?
- Who's Rick?

05:33.958 --> 05:35.000
My husband.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.335
Ooh.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.838
- Oh, so you're divorced?
- No.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.051
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

05:45.303 --> 05:46.720
No, I'm still married.

05:48.514 --> 05:52.809
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

05:53.311 --> 05:55.479
...sliding your foot
so far up my leg...

05:55.688 --> 05:58.231
...you can count
the change in my pocket?

05:59.942 --> 06:01.193
Don't worry.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.404
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.367
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

06:09.577 --> 06:11.453
Ethan is my...

06:11.871 --> 06:12.913
...boyfriend.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.331
What?

06:16.459 --> 06:19.336
So, uh, what kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

06:19.545 --> 06:22.130
...if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

06:23.049 --> 06:25.550
I suppose, mainly sexual.

06:26.886 --> 06:27.928
Huh.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.806
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.309
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

06:34.685 --> 06:40.357
Didn't you listen to the story?

06:40.566 --> 06:43.276
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

06:43.528 --> 06:46.947
I had trouble with it at first,
but I get all the good stuff.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.575
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

06:50.785 --> 06:52.452
...and no responsibility.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.872
This is every guy's fantasy!

06:56.082 --> 06:58.625
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

06:58.876 --> 07:00.585
No, of course not.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.714
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

07:05.466 --> 07:09.136
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.470
I couldn't.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.721
Good for you.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.182
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know...

07:14.392 --> 07:17.269
...that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

07:17.812 --> 07:18.854
You know...

07:19.063 --> 07:22.065
...monogamy can be a tricky concept.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.608
I mean, anthropologically...

07:26.529 --> 07:28.530
Fine. Now you'll never know.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.365
We're kidding. Tell us.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.200
- We wanna know.
- Come on!

07:32.410 --> 07:36.204
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey...

07:45.256 --> 07:46.339
Ta-da!

07:47.467 --> 07:50.510
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.847
Look! I cleaned!

07:54.056 --> 07:56.308
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.853
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.480
I don't know what it's for.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.899
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.318
What do you think?

08:06.569 --> 08:09.279
- It's very clean.
- Really, it looks great!

08:12.366 --> 08:16.369
Oh. Heh.
I see you moved the green ottoman.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.371
Uh-oh.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.791
How did that happen?

08:23.252 --> 08:25.712
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.257
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.801
Yeah, it's interesting.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.472
But you know what? Just for fun...

08:35.972 --> 08:39.433
...let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.937
Just to compare.

08:42.145 --> 08:43.647
Let's see. Ha!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.732
Well, it looks good there too.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.318
Let's leave it there for a while.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.155
I can't believe you tried
to move the green ottoman.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.492
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.577
She'll scratch your eyes out.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.663
You guys, I am not that bad!

08:59.872 --> 09:01.122
Yeah, you are.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.042
Remember, I lived with you?

09:04.293 --> 09:05.710
You were a little, you know...

09:10.132 --> 09:11.424
That is so unfair!

09:11.634 --> 09:15.470
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.934
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.978
But, hey, I can be a kook!

09:25.356 --> 09:27.440
All right, you madcap gal!

09:29.193 --> 09:30.360
Try to imagine this.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.281
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.117
- Why not?
- Because you're a kook!

09:39.245 --> 09:41.997
Instead, you wait until
they send you a notice.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.124
I could do that.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.295
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping...

09:48.504 --> 09:50.297
...and I buy laundry detergent.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.967
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.802
Why would someone do that?

09:58.097 --> 10:00.140
One might wonder.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.101
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.145
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

10:05.855 --> 10:10.150
Beads of condensation are inching
their way closer to the wood...

10:10.401 --> 10:11.443
Stop it!

10:15.156 --> 10:16.448
Oh, my God!

10:16.907 --> 10:18.825
It's true. Who am I?

10:19.327 --> 10:21.369
Monica, you're Mom.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.795
Uh-huh? Oh, my God!

10:31.797 --> 10:33.048
Okay.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.175
Okay, I'll be there.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.137
That was my agent.

10:41.098 --> 10:45.852
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

10:46.687 --> 10:48.647
Whoa! That's great!

10:48.981 --> 10:50.023
What's the part?

10:50.232 --> 10:52.275
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!

10:52.526 --> 10:54.361
This guy's why I became an actor.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.905
"I'm out of order?
You're out of order!

10:57.156 --> 10:59.991
This whole courtroom's out of order!"

11:01.035 --> 11:02.702
Seriously, what's the part?

11:02.953 --> 11:06.623
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in!"

11:06.957 --> 11:10.001
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?

11:11.962 --> 11:13.546
You're, you're...
What?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.510
I'm his butt double, okay?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.475
I play Al Pacino's butt.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.980
All right? He goes
into the shower, and then...

11:31.232 --> 11:32.732
...I'm his butt.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.818
Oh, my God!

11:35.111 --> 11:36.277
Come on, you guys.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.823
This is a real movie,
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!

11:40.074 --> 11:41.491
Oh, no, it's terrific.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.910
After all your years of struggling...

11:44.120 --> 11:47.330
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.877
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.546
This is a big break for me!

11:54.797 --> 11:56.423
You're right. It is.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.468
So are you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

12:12.356 --> 12:15.066
- I need to borrow some moisturizer.
- For what?

12:15.276 --> 12:17.277
What do you think?
Today's the big day!

12:17.820 --> 12:20.655
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.575
Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.076
Thank you.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.123
- Joey's mom's on the phone.
- He's in the bathroom.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.793
- You don't wanna go in there!
- Come on, we're roommates.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.006
My eyes! My eyes!

12:40.551 --> 12:42.051
I warned you.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.095
Who is being loud?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.306
Oh, that would be Monica.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.642
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.644
You got the whole night, huh?

12:51.896 --> 12:55.190
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so...

12:55.441 --> 12:57.358
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.695
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me...

13:00.946 --> 13:03.031
...it's worth it, okay?

13:03.240 --> 13:05.450
In a relationship,
you have these key moments...

13:05.659 --> 13:08.119
...you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.581
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.334
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.796
So, uh, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

13:18.047 --> 13:21.508
Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica
would remind you...

13:21.717 --> 13:25.512
...to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.848
But I'm not gonna do that.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.981
Damn it! Hire the girl.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.317
Okay, everybody ready?

13:40.069 --> 13:43.738
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.032
Lose the robe.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.159
Me?

13:48.410 --> 13:49.661
That would work.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.039
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.501
Okay, and the robe is lost.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.088
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.631
Let's roll it.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.258
Water's working.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.844
And action!

14:07.930 --> 14:09.347
And cut!

14:10.182 --> 14:11.641
Butt guy, what are you doing?

14:13.143 --> 14:14.352
I'm showering.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.354
No, that was clenching.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.984
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

14:21.235 --> 14:23.486
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.406
I think his butt would be angry here.

14:27.324 --> 14:30.076
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.913
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.833
And action!

14:38.168 --> 14:40.587
And cut! What was that?

14:41.922 --> 14:44.299
I was going for quiet desperation.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.511
But if you have to ask...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.061
God, I love these fingers.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.479
Thank you.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.232
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.777
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.824
- Oh, my God, I'm late!
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.994
- Don't go, don't go.
- Okay, okay.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.914
- I have to.
- Look, she's leaving.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.208
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.044
I thought you talked to Rick.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.171
It's not Rick.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.506
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.425
No, it's Andrew.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.016
I know there'll be many moments...

15:35.225 --> 15:38.561
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but...

15:39.396 --> 15:40.813
And Andrew is?

15:41.023 --> 15:43.149
He's... new.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.655
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

15:48.864 --> 15:51.324
No, that's not exactly what I was...

15:51.533 --> 15:53.368
Most women would kill...

15:53.619 --> 15:55.662
...for three guys like us.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.414
So, what do you want?

15:59.124 --> 16:00.166
You.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.211
- You have me.
- No, no. Just you.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.629
What do you mean?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.714
Lose the other guys.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.468
Like, all of them?

16:11.178 --> 16:14.138
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

16:14.598 --> 16:16.516
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

16:16.725 --> 16:19.060
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love...

16:19.311 --> 16:22.105
...without feeling obligated
to one another?

16:22.523 --> 16:26.109
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.237
Well, part of me wants that...

16:29.446 --> 16:31.656
...but it's like I'm two guys.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.867
I mean, one guy's saying,
"Shut up! This is great!"

16:35.995 --> 16:37.745
But there's this other guy.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.957
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart...

16:41.208 --> 16:44.043
...grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.

16:44.712 --> 16:48.840
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out, get out!"

16:49.758 --> 16:52.552
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

16:53.721 --> 16:57.348
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.059
Which one?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.022
The second guy.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.900
I see.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.906
Call me if you change your mind.

17:23.666 --> 17:26.794
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.518
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

17:43.979 --> 17:46.147
Right? I mean, this woman was...

17:46.356 --> 17:47.982
...unbelievably sexy...

17:48.233 --> 17:51.569
...and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable...

17:53.781 --> 17:55.782
Tell me why you did this again?

17:56.867 --> 17:57.950
- Hey!
- Hey!

17:58.202 --> 17:59.619
Movie star!

17:59.828 --> 18:03.498
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

18:05.667 --> 18:06.709
Nope.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.545
No? What happened, big guy?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.214
Big guy?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.593
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.595
I got fired!

18:18.847 --> 18:20.765
They said I acted too much with it.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.436
I told everybody about this.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.605
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.399
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.276
My mom will.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.280
There's something so sweet...

18:36.532 --> 18:38.741
...and disturbing about that.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.954
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years...

18:43.205 --> 18:46.207
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.167
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

18:48.377 --> 18:52.922
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.050
Did it feel like your shot?

18:57.469 --> 19:00.054
Hard to tell. I was naked.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.889
I don't think this was your shot.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.392
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.979
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

19:08.230 --> 19:12.108
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go...

19:12.317 --> 19:15.987
..."I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

19:19.283 --> 19:21.909
You think? That's so nice.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.704
Oh, come here.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.835
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.128
Good night.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.714
You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.342
Uh-huh.

19:39.887 --> 19:43.181
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

19:43.390 --> 19:45.683
...in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

19:47.603 --> 19:51.314
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

19:53.025 --> 19:54.233
Whenever.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.655
She is a kook.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.465
If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.636
No, don't do this!

20:21.887 --> 20:23.304
This is stupid!

20:23.555 --> 20:26.641
I don't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.185
But then everyone will know.

20:30.687 --> 20:34.982
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.943
I need help!
