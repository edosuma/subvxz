WEBVTT

00:19.520 --> 00:21.693
- Will it be me, Uncle?
- Yeah, it's going to be you.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.947
I only wish
I could go in your place, Idris.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.705
Nah, I don't,
'cause it's really going to hurt.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.499
It's starting.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.205
- What will happen?
- Oh.

00:38.288 --> 00:42.634
Nephew will drain
your mind and your soul from your body

00:42.793 --> 00:44.136
and leave your body empty.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.639
- I'm scared!
- I expect so, dear.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.016
But soon you'll have a new soul.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.312
There'll be a Time Lord coming!

00:54.805 --> 00:57.684
And then we discovered
it wasn't the robot king after all,

00:57.766 --> 00:59.109
it was the real one.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.146
Fortunately,
I was able to re-attach the head.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.233
- Do you believe any of this stuff?
- I was there.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.488
Oh, it's the warning lights.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.911
I'm getting rid of those.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.408
- They never stop!
- Hey.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.332
You're still thinking about it,
aren't you?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.659
Oh, shh!

01:15.867 --> 01:17.084
We saw him die.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.380
- Yeah, 200 years in the future.
- Yes, but it's still going to happen.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.376
- What was that?
- The door.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.470
It knocked.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.099
Right. We are in deep space.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.176
Very, very deep.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.472
And somebody's knocking.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.400
Oh, come here.

01:45.063 --> 01:48.317
Come here,
you scrumptious little beauty.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.584
- A box?
- Doctor, what is it?

01:58.410 --> 01:59.878
I've got mail.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.716
Time Lord emergency messaging system.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.169
In an emergency, we wrap up
our thoughts in psychic containers

02:07.252 --> 02:08.628
and send them through time and space.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.340
Anyway, there's a living Time Lord
still out there

02:11.381 --> 02:12.598
and it's one of the good ones!

02:12.674 --> 02:14.301
You said there weren't
any other Time Lords left.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.682
There are no Time Lords left anywhere
in the universe,

02:16.762 --> 02:18.184
but the universe
isn't where we're going.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.725
See that snake? The mark of The Corsair.
Fantastic bloke.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.436
He had that snake as a tattoo
in every regeneration.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.396
Didn't feel like himself
unless he had the tattoo.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.825
Or herself, a couple of times.
Ooh, she was a bad girl!

02:29.900 --> 02:31.994
Whoa! What is happening?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.696
We are leaving the universe!

02:33.779 --> 02:35.156
How can you leave the universe?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.535
With enormous difficulty!

02:36.615 --> 02:39.585
Right now I'm burning up Tardis rooms
to give us some welly.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.334
Goodbye, swimming pool.
Goodbye, scullery.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.755
Sayonara, squash court seven!

02:43.830 --> 02:45.207
Whoa!

03:00.180 --> 03:03.150
Okay. Okay. Where are we?

03:03.225 --> 03:07.105
Outside the universe,
where we've never, ever been.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.323
Is that meant to be happening?

03:14.403 --> 03:16.781
The power. It's draining.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.826
Everything's draining!
But it can't. That's...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.290
That's impossible.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.250
What is that?

03:24.329 --> 03:28.755
It's as if the Matrix, the soul
of the Tardis, has just vanished.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.715
Where would it go?

04:35.400 --> 04:36.777
So what kind of trouble is
your friend in?

04:36.860 --> 04:40.410
He was in a bind,
a bit of a pickle, sort of distressed.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.537
Well, you can just say you don't know.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.369
What is this place? The scrapyard
at the end of the universe?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.375
Not end of, outside of.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.712
How we can we be outside the universe?
The universe is everything.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.385
Imagine a great big soap bubble

04:53.460 --> 04:55.337
with one of those tiny little bubbles
on the outside.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.138
- Okay.
- But it's nothing like that.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.932
Completely drained, look at her.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.850
Wait.
So we're in a tiny bubble universe,

05:00.926 --> 05:02.678
sticking to the side
of the bigger bubble universe?

05:02.761 --> 05:05.731
Yes. No. But if it helps, yes.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.149
This place is full of rift energy.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.856
She'll probably refuel
just by being here.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.778
Now, this place, what do we think, eh?

05:11.853 --> 05:16.233
Gravity's almost Earth-normal,
air's breathable, but it smells like...

05:16.316 --> 05:17.442
- Arm pits.
- Arm pits.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.324
What about all this stuff?
Where did this come from?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.245
Well, there's a rift, now and then
stuff gets sucked through it.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.368
Not a bubble. A plughole.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.541
The universe has a plughole
and we've just fallen down it.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.493
Thief! Thief! You're my thief!

05:27.035 --> 05:29.379
She's dangerous!
Guard yourself.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.082
Look at you! Goodbye! No, not goodbye.
What's the other one?

05:32.541 --> 05:35.044
Watch out! Careful.
Keep back from her.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.760
Welcome, strangers, lovely.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.718
- Sony about the mad person.
- Why am I a thief? What have I stolen?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.552
Me. Are you going to steal me?
No, you have stolen me.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.354
You are stealing me. Oh!
Tenses are difficult, aren't they?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.399
Oh! Well, we are sorry, my dove.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.609
She's off her head.

05:51.810 --> 05:56.782
- They call me Auntie.
- And I'm Uncle. I'm everybody's uncle.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.735
Just keep back from this one, she bites!

05:59.818 --> 06:01.866
- Do I? Excellent.
- Ow!

06:01.903 --> 06:04.122
- No, no, no!
- Whoa!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.416
- Ow! Ow, ow!
- Oh, biting's excellent!

06:06.616 --> 06:08.084
It's like kissing,
only there's a winner!

06:08.159 --> 06:12.460
- Sorry. She's doolally.
- No, I'm not doolally. I'm...

06:13.081 --> 06:16.210
I'm... It's on the tip of my tongue.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.467
I've just had a new idea about kissing.
Come here, you!

06:19.546 --> 06:21.264
No, Idris, no!

06:21.590 --> 06:24.844
Oh, but now you're angry.
No, you're not. You will be angry.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.138
The little boxes will make you angry.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.770
Sorry? The little what? Boxes?

06:31.474 --> 06:34.899
Your chin is hilarious.
- Oi.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.027
It means the smell of dust after rain.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.278
- What does?
- Petrichor.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.654
But I didn't ask.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.613
Not yet. But you will.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.073
No. No, Idris.
I think you should have a rest.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.535
Rest, yes, yes, good idea!
I'll just see if there's an off switch.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.245
Whoa!

06:51.328 --> 06:54.548
Is that it? Is she dead now? So sad.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.833
She's still breathing.

06:57.083 --> 07:02.089
Nephew, take Idris somewhere
she cannot bite people, hmm?

07:02.297 --> 07:03.765
Oh, hello!

07:04.716 --> 07:05.808
Doctor, what is that?

07:05.884 --> 07:08.854
Oh, no. It's all right. It's an Ood.
Oods are good, love an Ood.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.226
Hello, Ood.

07:10.263 --> 07:14.234
Can't you talk?
Oh, I see, it's damaged.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.481
May I?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.063
It might be on the wrong frequency.

07:18.146 --> 07:22.117
Nephew was broken when he came here.
Why, he was half dead.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.780
House repaired him.
House repaired all of us.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.908
If you are receiving this message,
please help me.

07:29.991 --> 07:34.292
Send a signal to the High Council
of the Time Lords on Gallifrey.

07:34.371 --> 07:38.217
Te!! them that I am still alive!
I don't know where I am.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.591
I'm on some rock-like planet

07:42.796 --> 07:44.719
What was that? Was that him?

07:44.923 --> 07:47.893
No, no, it's picking up something else.

07:48.802 --> 07:53.228
But that's...
That's not possible. That's...

07:53.306 --> 07:55.775
Who else is here?
Tell me. Show me! Show me!

07:55.850 --> 08:00.447
Just what you see.
It's just the four of us. And the House.

08:00.522 --> 08:05.494
Nephew, will you take Idris somewhere
safe where she can't hurt nobody?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.865
The House? What's the House?

08:06.945 --> 08:09.789
House is all around you, my sweets.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.869
You are standing on him.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.418
This is the House. This world.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.793
Would you like to meet him?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.419
- Meet him?
- I'd love to.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.682
This way. Come, please. Come.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.559
What's wrong? What were those voices?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.479
Time Lords.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.020
It's not just the Corsair.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.361
Somewhere close by
there are lots and lots of...

08:41.312 --> 08:42.688
Time Lords.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.789
I'm...

08:53.283 --> 08:54.500
I'm...

08:58.413 --> 09:01.166
Big word, sad word.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.754
Why is that word so sad? No.

09:06.421 --> 09:10.051
Will be sad. Will be sad.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.887
Come. Come, come.

09:13.970 --> 09:18.976
Now you can see House
and he can look at you and he...

09:19.059 --> 09:20.436
I see.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.359
This asteroid is sentient.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.612
We walk on his back, breathe his air,
eat his food...

09:26.691 --> 09:29.535
- Smell its armpits.
- And do my will.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.823
You are most welcome, travellers.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.160
Doctor, that voice,
that's the asteroid talking?

09:36.242 --> 09:40.122
Yes. So you're like a sea urchin?

09:41.456 --> 09:44.300
Hard outer surface.
That's the planet we're walking on.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.094
Big, squashy, oogly thing inside.
That's you.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.968
That is correct, Time Lord.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.894
Ah! So you've met Time Lords before?

09:53.968 --> 09:56.221
Many travellers
have come through the rift;

09:56.304 --> 09:58.773
Like Auntie and Uncle and Nephew

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
I repair them when they break.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.942
- So there are Time Lords here, then?
- Not any more.

10:05.021 --> 10:09.401
But there have been many Tardises
on my back in days gone by

10:09.484 --> 10:13.159
Well, there won't be any more after us.
Last Time Lord. Last Tardis.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.333
A pity Your people were so kind.

10:16.783 --> 10:21.038
Be here in safety, Doctor;
Rest, feed, if you will.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.548
We're not actually going to stay here,
are we?

10:24.582 --> 10:28.587
Well, it seems like a friendly planet.
Literally. Mind if we poke around a bit?

10:28.670 --> 10:31.765
You can look all you want. Go, look.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.055
House loves you.

10:39.597 --> 10:43.852
Come on then, gang.
We're just going to see the sights.

10:51.985 --> 10:56.081
Oh! What was that?
Do fish have fingers?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.784
Like a nine-year-old
trying to rebuild a motorbike.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.834
What am I saying? Why am I saying that?

11:04.205 --> 11:08.927
Thief? Where's my thief? Thief!

11:12.046 --> 11:13.172
Thief!

11:15.758 --> 11:18.511
So as soon as the Tardis is refuelled,
we go, yeah?

11:18.595 --> 11:21.064
No. There are Time Lords here.
I heard them and they need me.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.733
You told me about your people
and you told me what you did.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.310
Yes, yes. But if they're like
the Corsair,

11:25.393 --> 11:26.645
they're good ones and I can save them.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.526
And then tell them
you destroyed all the others?

11:28.605 --> 11:31.859
I can explain. Tell them why I had to.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.068
You want to be forgiven.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.622
Don't we all?

11:40.909 --> 11:42.001
What do you need from me?

11:44.329 --> 11:46.798
My screwdriver. I left it in the Tardis.
It's in my jacket.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.716
- You’re wearing your jacket.
- My other jacket.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.634
- You have two of those?
- Okay. I'll get it.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.132
But Doctor, listen to me.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.091
Don't get emotional
because that's when you make mistakes.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.050
- Yes, boss.
- I'll call you from the Tardis.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.931
Rory, look after him.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.767
Rory, look after her.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.557
Yeah.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.823
I told you to look after him.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.527
He'll be fine. He's a Time Lord.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.161
It's just what they're called.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.830
It doesn't mean
he actually knows what he's doing.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.345
Hey, we're here.
Screwdriver's in your jacket, yeah?

12:34.712 --> 12:38.216
Yeah, it's around somewhere.
Have a good look.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.017
- Did you do that?
- I didn't do anything.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.568
Right. jacket.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.192
Come on. Where are you?

12:53.439 --> 12:57.160
Now, where are you all? Where are you?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.587
Well, they can't all be in here.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.153
- Please, do you read me?
- Help!

13:36.399 --> 13:39.073
- Please, do you read me?
- Damage to our engines...

13:39.152 --> 13:43.328
- Can you hear me? Please respond...
- Contraction and constriction of...

13:46.034 --> 13:49.208
just admiring your Time Lord
distress signal collection.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.124
Nice job. Brilliant job.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.468
Really thought I had some friends here.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.093
But this is what the Ood translator
picked up,

13:59.172 --> 14:02.096
cries for help from the long dead.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.850
How many Time Lords have you lured here
the way you lured me?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.068
And what happened to them all?

14:13.102 --> 14:16.402
House... House is kind and he is wise.

14:16.481 --> 14:20.611
House repairs you when you break!
Yes, I know!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.745
But how does he mend you?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.948
- You've got the eyes of a 20-year-old.
- Thank you.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.578
No. No. I mean it, literally.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.705
Your eyes are 50 years younger
than the rest of you.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.869
Your ears don't match,

14:29.952 --> 14:31.625
your right arm is two inches longer
than your left.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.049
And how's your dancing?
'Cause you've got two left feet.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.882
Patchwork people.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.633
You've been repaired
and patched up so often,

14:39.712 --> 14:41.885
I doubt there's anything left
of what used to be you.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.592
I had an umbrella like you once.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.804
Oh, now,
it's been a great arm for me, this.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.059
Corsair.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.149
He was a strapping big bloke,
wasn't he, Uncle?

14:52.183 --> 14:53.230
Big fella.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.734
I got the arm and then Uncle
got the spine and the kidneys.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.030
Kidneys.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.783
You gave me hope
and then you took it away.

15:00.858 --> 15:05.705
That's enough to make anyone dangerous.
God knows what it will do to me.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.246
Basically, run!

15:10.118 --> 15:12.541
Poor old Time Lord. Too late.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.874
House is too clever.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.588
No sonic screwdriver.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.390
Also, the doors seem
to have locked behind us.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.342
Rory thinks there is a perfectly
innocent explanation,

15:26.426 --> 15:27.518
but I think you lied to us.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.186
Time Lord stuff.
Needed you out of the way.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.185
What, we're not good enough
for your smart new friends?

15:31.222 --> 15:33.020
"Boxes will make you angry."
How could she know?

15:33.141 --> 15:36.065
- Doctor, what are you talking about?
- Stay put. Stay exactly where you are.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.151
We don't have much...choice.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.863
How did you know about the boxes?
You said they'd make me angry.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.949
- How did you know?
- Ah, it's my thief.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.029
Who are you?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.492
It's about time.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.331
He's not trusting us.
And he's being emotional.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.709
This is bad. This is very, very bad.

15:57.582 --> 16:01.212
Yeah. I think it probably is.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.098
Sometimes I hate being right.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.596
I don't understand. Who are you?

16:07.675 --> 16:10.428
Do you really not know me?
Just because they put me in here?

16:10.636 --> 16:14.891
- They said you were dangerous.
- Not the cage, stupid. In here.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.444
They put me in here.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.067
I'm the... Oh, what do you call me?

16:23.483 --> 16:27.829
We travel. I go...

16:28.488 --> 16:30.991
- The Tardis?
- Time and relative dimension in space.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.247
Yes, that's it. Names are funny.
It's me!

16:36.579 --> 16:37.705
I'm the Tardis.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.758
No, you're not.
You're a bitey mad lady.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.712
The Tardis is up-and-downy stuff
in a big blue box.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.513
Yes, that's me. A type 40 Tardis.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.934
I was already a museum piece
when you were young.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.182
And the first time
you touched my console you said...

16:52.261 --> 16:55.310
I said you were the most beautiful thing
I had ever known.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.734
And then you stole me. And I stole you.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.990
I borrowed you.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.989
Borrowing implies the eventual intention
to return the thing that was taken.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.704
What makes you think
I would ever give you back?

17:16.661 --> 17:18.628
- You're the Tardis?
- Yes.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.458
- My Tardis?
- My Doctor.

17:23.291 --> 17:27.762
Oh! We have now reached the point in the
conversation where you open the lock.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.444
- Are all people like this?
- Like what?

17:46.524 --> 17:48.743
So much bigger on the inside?

17:49.610 --> 17:50.657
I'm...

17:50.736 --> 17:55.458
Oh, what is that word?
It's so big, so complicated.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.331
- And so sad.
- But why?

17:58.411 --> 18:01.585
Why pull the living soul from a Tardis
and pop it in a tiny human head?

18:01.622 --> 18:02.669
What does it want you for?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.125
- Well, it doesn't want me.
- How do you know?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.051
- House eats Tardises.
- House what? What do you mean?

18:06.127 --> 18:07.470
I don't know. Something I heard you say.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.595
- When?
- In the future.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.141
- House eats Tardises?
- There you go. What are fish fingers?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.684
- When do I say that?
- Any second.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.228
Of course! House feeds on rift energy
and Tardises are bursting with it.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.731
And not raw, lovely and cooked,
processed food.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.150
- Mmm. Fish fingers.
- Do fish have fingers?

18:21.225 --> 18:26.072
But you can't eat a Tardis,
it would destroy you. Unless, unless...

18:26.147 --> 18:29.196
Unless you deleted
the Tardis Matrix first.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.074
So it deleted you.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.871
But House can't just delete
a Tardis consciousness,

18:33.946 --> 18:35.163
that would blow a hole in the universe.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.207
So it pulls out the Matrix,
sticks it into a living receptacle,

18:37.283 --> 18:39.285
and it feeds off
the remaining Artron energy.

18:40.536 --> 18:44.507
You were about to say all that.
I don't suppose you have to now.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.961
I sent Amy and Rory in there.
They'll be eaten. Amy! Amy!

18:48.044 --> 18:49.796
Rory, get the hell out of there!

18:50.004 --> 18:51.722
- Doctor, something's wrong.
- Yeah. It? House.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.925
He's after the Tardis.
Just get out, both of you!

18:56.260 --> 18:58.058
We can't. You locked the door, remember?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.437
But I've unlocked it.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.023
You stupid well haven't!

19:05.394 --> 19:06.816
Doctor, I don't like this.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.235
- Open!
- Doctor?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.451
Open this door!

19:16.155 --> 19:18.704
Rory, hold my hand.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.629
Amy. Rory!

19:36.300 --> 19:38.974
Amy? Amy, can you hear me?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.148
Okay. Right. I don't...

19:44.892 --> 19:47.145
I really don't know what to do.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.863
That's a new feeling.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.618
Listen, whatever happens,
at least we're together.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.080
- And we're in the Tardis, so we're safe.
- Yeah.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.505
You’re half right.
1 mean, you are in the Tardis.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.206
What a great adventure.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.792
I should have done this
half a million years ago.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.755
So, Amy, Rory,
Why shouldn't I just kill you now?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.139
- It's gone.
- Eaten?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.438
No, it left. Not eaten, hijacked.
But why?

20:22.513 --> 20:25.266
It's time for us both to go,
Unkie, together.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.019
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go? What do you mean
go? Where are you going?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.028
Well, we're dying, my love.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.690
It's time for Auntie and Uncle
to pop off.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.619
- I'm against it but...
- It's your fault, isn't it, sweets?

20:36.694 --> 20:39.664
'Cause you told House
it was the last Tardis.

20:40.865 --> 20:44.119
House can't feed on them
if there's none more coming, can he?

20:44.201 --> 20:48.502
So now he's off to your universe
to find more Tardises.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.835
- It won't.
- Oh, it will think of something.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.799
Actually, I feel fine.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.469
Not dead. You can't just die!

21:01.552 --> 21:03.395
We need to go to where I landed, Doctor.
Quickly.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.145
- Why?
- Because we are there in three minutes.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.900
We need to go...now!

21:08.851 --> 21:10.148
- Ow!
- What?

21:12.021 --> 21:14.023
Roughly how long do these bodies last?

21:19.737 --> 21:21.410
- You're dying.
- Yes, of course I'm dying.

21:21.489 --> 21:25.164
I don't belong in a flesh body.
I could blow the casing in no time.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.290
No, stop it. Don't get emotional.

21:27.369 --> 21:31.215
Hmm. That's what the orangey girl says.
You're the Doctor. Focus.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.920
On what? How?
I'm a madman with a box without a box!

21:35.169 --> 21:37.137
I'm stuck down the plughole
at the end of the universe

21:37.213 --> 21:39.215
on a stupid old junkyard!

21:39.840 --> 21:41.183
- Oh.
- Oh what?

21:41.258 --> 21:42.601
- No, I'm not.
- Not what?

21:42.676 --> 21:44.895
'Cause it's not a junkyard.
Don't you see? It's not a junkyard.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.472
- What is it then?
- It's a Tardis junkyard!

21:46.555 --> 21:49.434
Come on! Oh, sorry, do you have a name?

21:49.517 --> 21:51.110
Seven hundred years, finally he asks.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.861
- So what do I call you?
- I think you call me...

21:53.646 --> 21:54.818
Sexy.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.284
Only when we're alone!

21:58.567 --> 21:59.659
We are alone.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.408
Oh. Come on, then, Sexy.

22:05.282 --> 22:10.163
Corridors. I have corridors.
So much to learn about my new home.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.965
But you haven't answered
my question, children.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.384
Uh, question?

22:15.459 --> 22:20.090
You remember Te!! me why
I shouldn't just kill you both now?

22:20.297 --> 22:24.018
Well, because... Rory, why?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.434
Because

22:30.641 --> 22:32.814
killing us quickly wouldn't be any fun.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.483
And you need fun, don't you?

22:36.230 --> 22:38.858
That's what Auntie and Uncle were for,
wasn't it? Someone to make suffer.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.319
I had a PE teacher just like you.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.414
You need to be entertained

22:45.573 --> 22:49.498
and killing us quickly
wouldn't be entertainment.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.630
So entertain me. Run.

23:06.093 --> 23:10.473
A valley of half-eaten Tardises.
You thinking what I'm thinking?

23:11.181 --> 23:13.104
I'm thinking that
all of my sisters are dead,

23:13.183 --> 23:17.063
that they were devoured and that
we are looking at their corpses.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.365
Ah. Sorry. No, I wasn't thinking that.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.490
No. You were thinking you could build
a working Tardis console

23:23.569 --> 23:26.163
out of broken remnants
of 100 different models.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.332
And you don't care that it's impossible.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.284
It's not impossible
as long as we're alive.

23:30.367 --> 23:34.588
Rory and Amy need me.
So, yeah. We're going to build a Tardis.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.722
$0 are we having fun yet?

23:47.801 --> 23:51.681
I’m rather enjoying the sensation
of having you running around inside me.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.186
No!

23:53.849 --> 23:57.524
I've turned off the corridor
anti-grav so do be careful

23:58.145 --> 23:59.397
Come on.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.705
Whoa!

24:17.039 --> 24:19.462
Bond the tube directly
into the tachyon diverter.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.010
Yes, I have actually rebuilt a Tardis
before, you know.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.133
I know what I'm doing.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.715
You're like a nine-year-old trying to
rebuild a motorbike in his bedroom.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.095
And you never read the instructions.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.927
- I always read the instructions!
- There's a sign on my front door.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.684
You have been walking past it
for 700 years. What does it say?

24:32.763 --> 24:34.265
That's not instructions!

24:34.348 --> 24:36.225
There's an instruction at the bottom.
What does it say?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.810
- "Pull to open."
- Yes. And what do you do?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.487
- I push!
- Every single time. 700 years.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.610
Police box doors open out the way.

24:43.524 --> 24:46.653
I think I have earned the right
to open my front doors any way I want.

24:46.735 --> 24:50.080
Your front doors? Have you any idea
how childish that sounds?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.908
- You are not my mother.
- And you are not my child.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.994
You know,
since we're talking with mouths,

24:55.077 --> 24:57.205
not really an opportunity
that comes along very often,

24:57.287 --> 25:01.337
I just want to say, you know,
you have never been very reliable.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.714
And you have?

25:02.793 --> 25:04.136
You didn't always take me
where I wanted to go.

25:04.211 --> 25:07.385
No, but I always took you
where you needed to go.

25:08.549 --> 25:09.801
You did.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.683
Look at us. Talking! Wouldn't it
be amazing if we could always talk?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.978
Even when you're stuck inside the box?

25:14.221 --> 25:16.019
But you know
I'm not constructed that way.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.224
I exist across all space and time

25:17.307 --> 25:21.028
and you talk and run around
and bring home strays.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.655
You okay?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.113
One of the kidneys has already failed.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.204
It doesn't matter. We need to finish
assembling the console.

25:34.283 --> 25:38.038
Using a console without a proper shell.
It's not going to be safe.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.872
This body has about
18 minutes left to live.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.084
The universe we're in
will reach absolute zero in three hours.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.501
Safe is relative.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.507
Then we need to get a move on, eh,
old girl?

26:01.351 --> 26:02.398
No!

26:04.396 --> 26:05.864
- Amy!
- No!

26:07.775 --> 26:08.867
Amy!

26:10.819 --> 26:12.492
Amy.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.664
Amy!

26:17.326 --> 26:18.418
Amy!

26:22.623 --> 26:23.749
Rory?

26:25.209 --> 26:26.256
Where have you been?

26:26.335 --> 26:28.008
I stepped through that door
and it came back here.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.843
- But you've been hours.
- No, I haven't.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.851
It's House,
and it's messing with the Tardis.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.520
Come on, walk this way.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.485
- No!
- No! Oh!

26:48.774 --> 26:50.902
You'll need to install the time rotor.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.787
Well, how is this
going to make it through the rift? How?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.951
We're almost done. Thrust diffuser.

26:59.493 --> 27:02.963
- Ah, retroscope. Blue thingy.
- Oh, Doctor.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.795
Do you ever wonder why I chose you
all those years ago?

27:05.874 --> 27:08.753
- I chose you. You were unlocked.
- Of course I was.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.261
I wanted to see the universe,
so I stole a Time Lord and I ran away.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.761
And you were the only one mad enough.

27:13.841 --> 27:17.186
Right. Perfect. Look at that.
What could possibly go wrong?

27:17.803 --> 27:21.148
That's fine. That always happens.
No! Hang on. Wait.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.786
Amy?

27:38.866 --> 27:40.243
Oh, my God.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.452
Rory?

27:42.536 --> 27:46.507
You left me. How could you do that?
How could you leave me?

27:47.875 --> 27:48.967
How long have you been here?

27:49.042 --> 27:52.342
Two thousand years I waited for you!
You did it to me again!

27:52.421 --> 27:55.220
I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.760
Rory, what are you doing?

27:58.302 --> 27:59.724
They come for me at night.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.315
Every single night,
they come for me and they hurt me.

28:03.473 --> 28:08.821
Amy, they hurt me over and over
and over and over...

28:08.896 --> 28:12.025
- Rory.
- How could you leave me?

28:12.733 --> 28:15.452
How could you do that to me?

28:19.406 --> 28:21.249
Right. Okay, let's go.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.544
Follow that Tardis!

28:25.162 --> 28:28.632
Oh, no, come on. There's rift energy
everywhere, you can do it.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.337
Okay, diverting all power to thrust.
Let's be having you.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.805
- No, no, no, no!
- What's wrong?

28:35.881 --> 28:39.055
It can't hold the charge.
I can't even start. There's no power!

28:39.843 --> 28:41.220
Will you...

28:42.429 --> 28:44.102
I've got nothing!

28:44.681 --> 28:46.479
Oh, my beautiful idiot.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.027
You have what you've always had.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.980
You've got me.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.683
No! No!

29:31.770 --> 29:32.896
Rory.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.485
I'm so, so sorry!

29:41.738 --> 29:43.160
- Amy?

29:53.583 --> 29:56.427
It's messing with our heads.
Come on, run.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.604
- Whoo-hoo!
- We've locked on to them!

30:06.346 --> 30:09.566
They'll have to lower the shields
when we're close enough to phase inside!

30:09.933 --> 30:14.359
Can you get a message to Amy?
The telepathic circuits are online!

30:14.563 --> 30:18.033
Which one's Amy? The pretty one?

30:20.110 --> 30:22.659
- Rory, what's wrong?
- It's like I'm getting a message.

30:22.863 --> 30:23.910
Hello, pretty!

30:24.656 --> 30:25.828
What the hell is that?

30:26.616 --> 30:29.961
Don't worry. Telepathic messaging.
No, that's Rory.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.792
You have to go to the old control room.
I'm putting the route in your head.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.046
When you get there,

30:35.125 --> 30:38.049
use the purple slider on
the nearest panel to lower the shields.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.722
- The pretty one?
- You'll have about 12 seconds

30:40.797 --> 30:43.641
before the room goes into phase
with the invading Matrix.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.596
I'll send you the passkey
when you get there. Good luck.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.684
What was that?

30:49.264 --> 30:52.734
It was that woman.
That mad woman and the Doctor.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.812
- The Doctor?
- We have to keep going.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.278
How's he going to be able
to take down the shields anyway?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.076
The House is in the control room!

31:01.151 --> 31:03.404
I directed him
to one of the old control rooms.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.707
There aren't any old control rooms!
They were all deleted or remodelled!

31:06.740 --> 31:10.461
I archive them! For neatness!
I've got about 30 now!

31:10.535 --> 31:13.379
But I've only changed the desktop,
what, a dozen times?

31:13.747 --> 31:15.124
So far, yes!

31:15.207 --> 31:17.960
You can't archive something
that hasn't happened yet!

31:18.251 --> 31:19.423
You can't.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.102
What happened to the lights?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.021
The lights are fine.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.145
It's messing with our heads again.

31:39.981 --> 31:44.031
- Okay. Stay there a second.
- What is it? What?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.033
Just hang on.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.000
Don't leave me.
I can hardly see, you idiot!

31:52.619 --> 31:53.711
Rory?

31:55.789 --> 31:57.211
- Rory?
- It's okay.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.261
I'm fine. Come towards my voice.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.965
What happened? Where are you?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.678
I just banged my head.
Just keep coming.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.808
Reach out your hand.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.869
This way. Come on, run!

32:31.741 --> 32:34.494
Keep going!
You're doing it, You Sexy Thing!

32:34.911 --> 32:37.289
See, you do call me that.
Is it my name?

32:37.372 --> 32:40.125
- You bet it's your name!
- Whoo!

32:48.925 --> 32:50.598
I can see. Now, Rory, I can see.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.475
That was the Ood thing, the Nephew,
and it's still coming.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.977
I know. So where is this place?

32:55.056 --> 32:57.900
This is where she told me to go.
She said she'd send me the passkey!

32:59.519 --> 33:03.615
- Crimson. Eleven. Delight. Petrichor.
- Crimson. Eleven. Delight. Petrichor.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.865
- Petrichor.
- What do I do, do I say it?

33:06.902 --> 33:09.576
Crimson. Eleven. Delight. Petrichor.

33:11.823 --> 33:12.870
I said it.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.701
- Petrichor. Petrichor.
- I said it!

33:14.743 --> 33:16.086
Petrichor.

33:16.161 --> 33:20.007
She told you what it meant.
The smell of wet dust, remember? So...

33:20.081 --> 33:21.333
Always the meaning, not the word.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.335
- The meaning of what?
- The Tardis interface is telepathic.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.465
You don't say it, you think it.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.137
- It's coming.
- Quiet!

33:32.302 --> 33:34.475
And the smell of dust after rain.

33:34.554 --> 33:42.939
Crimson. Eleven. Delight.
The smell of dust after rain.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.818
What is this place?

33:48.527 --> 33:50.325
Another control room?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.284
Right, shields.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.705
Got it.

33:58.495 --> 34:01.123
They did it! Shields down.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.967
How did you find this place?
It's not on my internal schema tics.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.927
I had hoped you two could join Nephew
as my servants.

34:13.842 --> 34:16.346
But you two are nothing but trouble.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.145
Ne, Mew, J

34:20.350 --> 34:21.601
kill them.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.244
We're coming through!

34:31.319 --> 34:33.071
Get out of the way
or you'll be atomised!

34:33.780 --> 34:35.623
- Where are you coming through?
- I don't know!

34:36.157 --> 34:37.373
Oh, great. Thanks.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.706
- It's not going to hold!

34:44.873 --> 34:46.126
Hold on!

34:58.555 --> 34:59.772
Doctor.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.858
Not good. Not good at all.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.819
- How do you walk around in these things?
- Well, we're not quite there yet.

35:11.901 --> 35:15.656
Just hold on. Amy, this is...

35:16.448 --> 35:18.701
Well, she's my Tardis.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.543
Except she's a woman.
She's a woman and she's my Tardis.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.883
- She's the Tardis?
- And she's a woman.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.461
She's a woman and she's the Tardis.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.596
Did you wish really hard?

35:32.297 --> 35:33.674
Shut up! Not like that.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.259
Hello. I'm...

35:36.301 --> 35:38.804
- Sexy.
- Oh! Still shut up.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.935
The environment
has been breached

35:41.014 --> 35:43.016
Nephew, kill them all.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.022
Where's Nephew?

35:45.101 --> 35:46.774
He was standing
right where you materialised.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.947
Ah! Well, he must have
been redistributed.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.029
- Meaning what?
- You're breathing him.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.407
Another Ood I failed to save.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.581
Doctor, 1 did not expect you

35:57.656 --> 36:01.752
Well, that's me all over, isn't it?
Lovely old unexpected me.

36:01.826 --> 36:05.581
The big question is now you’re here,
how to dispose of you?

36:05.872 --> 36:06.919
I could play with gravity..

36:13.213 --> 36:17.343
Or! could evacuate the ah
from this room and watch you choke.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.308
You really don't want to do that!

36:24.391 --> 36:26.439
Why shouldn't I just kill you now?

36:26.518 --> 36:29.647
Because then I won't be able
to help you! Listen to your engines.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.278
Just listen to them. You don't have
the thrust and you know it.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.984
Right now I'm your only hope

36:34.067 --> 36:36.866
for getting out of your little bubble
through the rift and into my universe.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.039
- And mines the one with the food in!
- Water...

36:39.114 --> 36:43.494
You just have to promise not to kill us.
That's all. just promise.

36:43.576 --> 36:46.250
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.002
I'm sure it's an entity of its word.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.425
Doctor, she's burning up.
She's asking for water.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.840
Hey. Hang in there, old girl.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.519
Not long now. It'll be over soon.

37:01.594 --> 37:05.315
I always liked it
when you called me "old girl".

37:05.974 --> 37:09.604
You want me to give my word?
Easy I promise.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.648
Fine. Okay. I trust you.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.742
Just delete, ooh,
30% of the Tardis rooms,

37:15.817 --> 37:17.785
you'll free up thrust
enough to make it through.

37:17.861 --> 37:20.705
Activate sub-routine sigma nine.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.166
Why would you tell me this?

37:23.283 --> 37:25.877
Because we want to get back
to our universe as badly as you do.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.538
And I'm nice.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.294
Yes. I can delete rooms

37:30.373 --> 37:35.254
and I can also rid myself of vermin
if I delete this room first.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.718
Thank you, Doctor; very helpful.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.973
Goodbye, Time Lord.
Goodbye, little humans. Goodbye, Idris.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.833
Yes. I mean you could do that,
but it just won't work.

38:04.908 --> 38:05.955
Hardwired fail-safe.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.456
Living things
from rooms that are deleted

38:07.535 --> 38:10.004
are automatically deposited
in the main control room.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.205
But thanks for the lift.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.257
We are in your universe now, Doctor.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.882
Why should it matter to me
in which room you die?

38:15.960 --> 38:18.839
I can kill you just as easily here
as anywhere.

38:18.922 --> 38:22.017
rear me.
I’ve killed hundreds of Time Lords.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.469
Fear me. I've killed all of them.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.896
I don't understand.
There isn't a forest in here.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.895
Yeah, you're right.
You've completely won.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.149
Oh, you can kill us
in oodles of really inventive ways,

38:33.228 --> 38:36.402
but before you do kill us,
allow me and friends Amy and Row

38:36.481 --> 38:40.156
to congratulate you
on being an absolutely worthy opponent.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.662
Congratulations.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.957
Yep, you've defeated us,
me and my lovely friends here,

38:50.036 --> 38:53.040
and last but definitely not least,
the Tardis Matrix herself,

38:53.122 --> 38:57.127
a living consciousness
you ripped out of this very control room

38:57.210 --> 38:59.304
and locked up into a human body,
and look at her.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.721
Doctor, she's stopped breathing.

39:00.797 --> 39:04.051
- Enough! That is enough.
- No. It's never enough!

39:04.133 --> 39:06.056
You forced the Tardis into a body

39:06.135 --> 39:09.514
so she'd burn out safely a very long way
away from this control room.

39:09.764 --> 39:12.233
A flesh body
can't hold the Tardis Matrix and live.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.400
Look at her body, House.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.438
And you think I should mourn her?

39:16.521 --> 39:17.568
No.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.610
I think you should be very, very careful

39:21.693 --> 39:24.742
about what you let back
into this control room.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.290
You took her from her home.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.661
But now she's back in the box again
and she's free!

39:33.204 --> 39:36.333
No! Doctor, stop this!

39:36.416 --> 39:39.420
Ah! Stop this now!

39:39.460 --> 39:42.259
Look at my girl, look at her go!

39:42.463 --> 39:44.716
Bigger on the inside!

39:45.341 --> 39:46.888
- You see, House?
- Make her stop!

39:46.968 --> 39:48.311
- That's your problem.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.016
The size of a planet,
but inside you are just so small.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.192
Make it stop!

39:54.392 --> 39:56.190
Finish him off, girl.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.780
Don? do this!

40:07.864 --> 40:10.993
Doctor? Are you there?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.791
It's so very dark in here.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.211
I'm here.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.840
I've been looking for a word.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.770
A big, complicated word, but so sad.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.395
I've found it now.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.272
What word?

40:38.436 --> 40:39.608
Alive.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.237
I'm alive!

40:44.192 --> 40:45.614
Alive isn't sad.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.162
It's sad when it's over.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.703
I'll always be here.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.002
But this is when we talked.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.213
And now even that has come to an end.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.757
There's something
I didn't get to say to you.

41:05.505 --> 41:06.757
Goodbye?

41:06.839 --> 41:10.469
No, I just wanted to say...

41:12.220 --> 41:13.346
hello.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.150
Hello, Doctor.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.563
It's so very, very nice to meet you.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.326
Please.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.489
I don't want you to.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.374
Please.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.384
I love you.

41:46.963 --> 41:49.057
Where?

42:08.901 --> 42:10.073
How's it going under there?

42:10.153 --> 42:13.953
Yeah. just putting a firewall
around the Matrix. Almost done.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.327
- Are you going to make her talk again?
- Can't.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.537
- Why not?
- Spacey-wacey, isn't it?

42:19.620 --> 42:21.793
Well, actually, it's because
the Time Lords discovered that

42:21.873 --> 42:25.503
if you take an 11th-dimensional Matrix
and fold it into a mechanical, then...

42:26.627 --> 42:28.846
Yes, it's spacey-wacey!

42:30.381 --> 42:33.726
Sorry. At the end, she was talking.
She kept repeating something.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.270
- I don't know what it meant.
- What did she say?

42:36.345 --> 42:39.098
"The only water in the forest
is the river."

42:39.140 --> 42:40.938
She said we'd need to know that someday.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.816
- It doesn't make sense, does it?
- Not yet.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.565
- You okay?
- No.

42:48.608 --> 42:51.908
I watched her die. I shouldn't
let it get to me, but it still does.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.409
I'm a nurse.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.870
Letting it get to you,
you know what that's called?

42:56.949 --> 42:59.202
Being alive. Best thing there is.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.413
Being alive right now
is all that counts.

43:02.497 --> 43:05.376
Nearly finished.
Two more minutes, then we're off.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.460
The Eye of Orion's restful,
if you like restful.

43:07.502 --> 43:09.800
I can never
really get the hang of restful.

43:09.879 --> 43:12.928
What do you think, dear?
Where shall we take the kids this time?

43:13.007 --> 43:16.181
Look at you pair.
It's always you and her, isn't it?

43:16.260 --> 43:17.637
Long after the rest of us have gone.

43:17.929 --> 43:20.603
A boy and his box,
off to see the universe.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.893
Well, you say that
as if it's a bad thing.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.852
But honestly,
it's the best thing there is.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.772
The House deleted all the bedrooms.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.072
I should probably make you two
a new bedroom.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.650
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

43:31.943 --> 43:35.447
Okay, um, Doctor, this time
could we lose the bunk beds?

43:35.530 --> 43:39.080
No, bunk beds are cool.
A bed with a ladder.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.870
You can't beat that.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.917
It's your room.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.545
Up those stairs, keep walking
till you find it. Off you pop.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.049
Doctor, do you have a room?

44:18.197 --> 44:19.699
Are you there?

44:21.284 --> 44:22.877
Can you hear me?

44:25.413 --> 44:27.336
No. I'm a silly old...

44:27.582 --> 44:30.836
Okay. The Eye of Orion,
or wherever we need to go.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.261
Hello!

44:41.137 --> 44:43.265
Whoo-hoo!

45:00.406 --> 45:04.001
The flesh.
It's fully programmable matter;

45:04.911 --> 45:07.630
It acts like life, but it still needs
to be controlled by us.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.881
They can't remain stable
without us plumbed into them.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.093
Trust me. I'm the Doctor.
