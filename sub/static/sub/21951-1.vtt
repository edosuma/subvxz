      THE WILD CARD, OKAY?      

02:48.501 --> 02:50.035

02:52.438 --> 02:54.339

02:54.407 --> 02:56.675
     AND THEN FOR THE EIGHTH    
        PRELIMINARY FIGHT       

02:56.743 --> 02:58.343
 WE TAKE TWO GUYS WHO HAVE LOST

    STILL IN THE COMPETITION,   

03:02.815 --> 03:05.417
     AND WE BRING THEM BACK     
AS THE WILD-CARD FIGHTERS.
