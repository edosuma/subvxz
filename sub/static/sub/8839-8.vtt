WITH EVERY HUMAN BEING
EVERYWHERE.

45:49.788 --> 45:53.166
IN THE NAME OF GOD,
THINK ABOUT IT.

46:07.473 --> 46:10.767
SHALL WE RISE AND SING
"WHAT A FRIEND"?

46:20.903 --> 46:26.449
WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE
IN JESUS

46:26.617 --> 46:31.078
ALL OUR SINS
AND GRIEFS TO BEAR

46:31.246 --> 46:36.751
WHAT A PRIVILEGE
TO CARRY

46:36.919 --> 46:41.088
EVERYTHING TO GOD
IN PRAYER!

46:41.256 --> 46:43.341
OF COURSE,
WE'RE NOT OPEN
USUALLY ON SUNDAY,

46:43.509 --> 46:45.301
BUT IF YOU STOP BY
AFTER THE SERVICE,

46:45.469 --> 46:47.470
I'VE GOT THAT ITEM
THAT YOU ORDERED.

46:47.638 --> 46:51.891
O WHAT NEEDLESS
PAIN WE BEAR

46:52.059 --> 46:57.355
ALL BECAUSE
WE DO NOT CARRY

46:57.523 --> 47:02.193
EVERYTHING TO GOD
IN PRAYER

47:11.620 --> 47:14.539
Laura: THE "PEN & THE PLOW"
WENT OUT OF BUSINESS

47:14.706 --> 47:15.957
A MONTH LATER,

47:16.124 --> 47:18.125
AND WALNUT GROVE
GOT BACK TO NORMAL.

47:18.293 --> 47:20.837
PA HOPES SOMEDAY WE'LL
HAVE ANOTHER NEWSPAPER,

47:21.004 --> 47:23.714
A REAL NEWSPAPER
THAT PRINTS THE TRUTH.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.675
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS,
PA SAYS,

47:25.843 --> 47:28.928
IS AS IMPORTANT AS
ALL OUR OTHER FREEDOMS

47:29.096 --> 47:31.514
AND SHOULD NEVER BE ABUSED.
