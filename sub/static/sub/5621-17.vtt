00:29.296 --> 00:30.936
(echoing): Shut up!

00:34.802 --> 00:36.135
Damn it, Mitch.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.371
You told me you were
done with cocaine.

00:39.373 --> 00:43.475
Yeah, well, I told you that
when I was wasted off of my ass.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.978
What am I supposed
to tell Judge Hornstock?

00:45.980 --> 00:47.813
Tell him he can wait!
They can all wait!

00:47.815 --> 00:49.381
I'm the freaking Grinder.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.651
Then come inside, baby,

00:52.653 --> 00:54.653
and grind.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.321
The way...

00:56.323 --> 00:58.157
only...

00:58.159 --> 00:59.992
you...

00:59.994 --> 01:01.794
can.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.496
You think, just because

01:04.498 --> 01:06.331
you're my partner's daughter,

01:06.333 --> 01:08.400
that you can have
your way with me?

01:10.838 --> 01:11.837
Well, you...

01:11.839 --> 01:14.073
are sadly mistaken.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.175
(Devin gasps)

01:16.177 --> 01:17.509
Oh, no, no, no.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.679
No!

01:20.681 --> 01:22.714
I'm not supposed
to be watching this.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.016
Dean is in the building.

01:24.018 --> 01:25.050
Yes, he cleansed himself
of<i> The Grinder.</i>

01:25.052 --> 01:26.218
We're all very proud of him.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.886
So proud. But what if, Todd,

01:27.888 --> 01:31.190
what if Dean said
good-bye to The Grinder

01:31.192 --> 01:32.891
at the very moment we needed

01:32.893 --> 01:33.892
The Grinder the most?

01:33.894 --> 01:35.194
Stewart, I can't do this.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.396
What happens next, Todd?
Stewart, please.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.064
In the show. Where did they
take the storyline?

01:39.066 --> 01:40.566
They lost him, okay?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.201
He went to rehab,
and they had to figure out

01:42.203 --> 01:43.202
how to win without him!

01:43.204 --> 01:44.703
How'd they do that?

01:44.705 --> 01:46.785
How'd they win cases
without The Grinder?

01:51.545 --> 01:54.446
(whispering): They didn't.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.584
What are you doing, Todd?

01:58.586 --> 02:01.487
Shh.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.624
¶ ¶

02:07.128 --> 02:09.795
Dad, I think we need
to hire an outside firm

02:09.797 --> 02:11.063
to represent you in this

02:11.065 --> 02:12.064
malpractice thing.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.632
I 100% disagree.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.134
All right,
I'll bring someone in.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.135
What?!

02:16.137 --> 02:17.970
(sighing): Stew, let it go.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.805
Come on, man, Dad's moved on,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.406
and I've moved on.
What does that even mean?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.308
I've enrolled in law school.
Oh, which reminds me,

02:23.310 --> 02:25.077
can my internship
be used as a credit?

02:25.079 --> 02:26.311
I think we can figure
something out.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.646
Great.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.148
Dean, you enrolled
in law school? Now?

02:29.150 --> 02:30.649
When we could
possibly lose the firm?

02:30.651 --> 02:31.984
Well, I got to learn, bro.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.652
And who knows?
Maybe if I study hard enough,

02:33.654 --> 02:35.654
I can figure out
how to win this case.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.322
And save the firm.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.659
Dad, you are not hiring
another lawyer.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.927
I am right on this.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.595
You want to work this case?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.430
Get your brother back
and represent me together.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.099
And if this is any kind of

02:47.101 --> 02:48.467
conspiracy like you say it is,

02:48.469 --> 02:50.169
you're gonna need The Grinder.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.606
So, uh, what am I
walking into here?

02:54.608 --> 02:55.607
You're about to enter

02:55.609 --> 02:58.110
Law 140: Introduction

02:58.112 --> 03:00.479
to Torts.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.981
What if I don't fit in?
What if I'm not as smart

03:02.983 --> 03:04.816
as everybody else? Hey.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.151
I don't like that kind of talk.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.620
You are better than everyone

03:08.622 --> 03:09.788
at everything,

03:09.790 --> 03:11.657
and don't you ever forget it.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.959
Now what do you say
we go in there

03:13.961 --> 03:15.727
and learn a little law?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.830
PROFESSOR: In order to prevail,

03:18.832 --> 03:20.799
the plaintiff in the lawsuit...

03:20.801 --> 03:23.535
¶ ¶

03:26.373 --> 03:27.639
(gasping)

03:27.641 --> 03:29.041
(sighs) Sorry.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.142
Sorry I'm late.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.644
I'm so sorry. No, it's okay.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.645
It's fine. Sorry, excuse me.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.647
Excuse me, pardon me.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.316
Excuse me. Let him through.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.717
(professor chuckles)
Come on, man.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.986
Ouch. Todd. Sorry.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.987
We good?

03:41.989 --> 03:42.988
You settled in? Yeah.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.389
Great, so...

03:44.391 --> 03:46.325
we're about two months in...

03:46.327 --> 03:47.326
um...

03:47.328 --> 03:48.560
You know what,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.229
it might be easier
to just go back

03:50.231 --> 03:51.830
to the first day, catch you up.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.332
Oh, no, no, uh...

03:53.334 --> 03:54.566
please, um...

03:54.568 --> 03:57.402
I do not want
any special treatment.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.670
(whispering): Um, you should
join our study group

03:58.672 --> 03:59.671
later. Tort law.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.672
Yeah, we'd love to...

04:00.674 --> 04:02.341
have you.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.675
Gr... yeah, great. Yeah.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.743
Thank you.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.078
So, we were discussing

04:06.080 --> 04:08.013
the seven different
types of torts

04:08.015 --> 04:10.549
that can... yes, Mr. Sanderson.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.884
Um, forgive me if you've
covered this previously, but

04:12.886 --> 04:15.020
what is a tort? Oh.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.388
Um... You know what?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.723
I think it would be better

04:17.725 --> 04:18.857
if you started at the beginning.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.192
Absolutely.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.094
Everyone, turn to page one.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.030
STEWART: Hey. Oh, hey.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.565
How'd it go with your dad?
Did Dean talk him

04:26.567 --> 04:27.566
into hiring someone else?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.867
Uh, sort of.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.602
He wants us to...
where's the coffee?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.237
Oh, I moved it over here.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.572
I didn't get why it was
so far away from the machine.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.407
Oh, good idea. Thanks.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.708
So, what happened?

04:36.710 --> 04:37.743
(sighs)

04:37.745 --> 04:38.910
He wants us to do it together.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.445
He won't let me work on the case

04:40.447 --> 04:42.214
until I get The Grinder back.
That's ridiculous.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.582
It's ridiculous. Come on.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.550
Look at us. We used to
only get to do

04:45.552 --> 04:46.952
this at home,
now we're doing it here.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.886
I was just thinking that.

04:47.888 --> 04:48.887
Were you really? I was.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.888
I was thinking it's nice

04:49.890 --> 04:50.956
to do at a new location.

04:50.958 --> 04:51.957
Yeah, it's, like, refreshing.
Right?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.191
It's nice, it's nice.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.296
(burbling)

04:58.465 --> 04:59.965
Coffee's taking a long time.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.133
It's never been this long.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.467
I feel like it's broken.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.069
(bell ringing)
DEAN: This is nice.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.471
I could really pull some
all-nighters in here, boy.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.573
Why? Um, what are
you even doing here?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.142
Yeah, aren't you already
a lawyer?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.643
Oh, I used to think so.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.978
If you'd asked me
a couple weeks ago,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.413
I'd be singing a different tune.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.580
When The Grinder was

05:15.582 --> 05:16.815
taken prisoner in season three,

05:16.817 --> 05:18.150
was that just a ploy

05:18.152 --> 05:19.151
to get back at Ali Larter?

05:19.153 --> 05:20.152
You know, I don't talk

05:20.154 --> 05:21.153
about the show anymore.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.587
And besides,

05:22.589 --> 05:23.755
we've been here over
an hour and we haven't even

05:23.757 --> 05:24.489
cracked these books.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.490
Books are lame.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.092
Don't you ever

05:27.094 --> 05:28.427
say that!

05:28.429 --> 05:30.128
I just don't want any of you

05:30.130 --> 05:31.763
to make the same mistakes
that I did.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.098
I wasted the best

05:33.100 --> 05:34.766
law years of my life
on<i> The Grinder.</i>

05:34.768 --> 05:36.301
So, promise me

05:36.303 --> 05:39.771
you'll do the book stuff first
and then do the TV show.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.939
STEWART: Uh, hi.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.441
Sorry for interrupting.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.309
Oh, everybody,
this is my brother Stew.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.310
A law school graduate.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.311
Yeah. Cool.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.113
Uh, thank you. Todd?

05:48.115 --> 05:50.115
I thought you
had a dentist appointment.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.616
Okay, you caught me.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.285
I'm just here helping
Dean get situated.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.287
Right, uh, can I talk
to you for a second?

05:55.289 --> 05:58.123
Stew, anything that you have
to say to me can be said

05:58.125 --> 05:59.624
in front of the whole group.

05:59.626 --> 06:03.628
Okay, um, I need you
to come by the office.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.796
I want to show you something.
What?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.132
Dean, our dad needs us, come on.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.633
(Dean sighs)

06:08.635 --> 06:10.202
Fine, I will come,

06:10.204 --> 06:12.471
but only as a student
of the law.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.472
Nothing more.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.974
Well, that's all I can ask.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.376
Good, that's all I can give.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.648
So, this is the plan,
'cause we need

06:23.650 --> 06:24.649
The Grinder back?

06:24.651 --> 06:25.550
This is the plan.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.551
Well...

06:26.553 --> 06:27.386
just as I left it.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.387
I knew you'd come back.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.988
He's been gone a day.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.656
Hey, let me just get
this evidence board

06:31.658 --> 06:33.158
out of the way. Evidence board?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.326
Yeah, just, uh...

06:34.328 --> 06:35.394
a little something

06:35.396 --> 06:36.995
we've been working on.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.163
And you just...

06:38.165 --> 06:39.030
put this together?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.332
Dean, I'll be honest.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.666
It kind of just put
itself together.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.667
Maybe we should, uh...

06:42.669 --> 06:45.003
(Dean mumbles dismissively)

06:45.005 --> 06:46.505
It's just an evidence board.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.707
What do you make of it, Deano?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.175
Well...

06:50.177 --> 06:51.676
it's everybody that we've been

06:51.678 --> 06:53.378
dealing with all year.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.380
What else?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.715
It's all connected.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.382
Yes.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.717
By string.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.886
In a chaotic fashion.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.221
But is there order...

07:03.223 --> 07:05.056
in the chaos?

07:05.058 --> 07:07.893
May... um...

07:07.895 --> 07:08.727
I can't see it.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.895
Maybe we...

07:09.897 --> 07:10.729
should leave you alone with it.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.897
What are you doing?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.398
What? Nothing.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.069
You guys are pathetic. Dean, I
was just trying to get you to...

07:18.071 --> 07:19.905
Oh, I know what
you're trying to do.

07:19.907 --> 07:20.739
Well, guess what.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.240
He's gone.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.708
And he's never coming back.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.076
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:25.078 --> 07:26.311
I have to get back to class.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.415
STEWART: <i>Then we had this
evidence board, you know</i>

07:30.417 --> 07:31.883
those ridiculous things
from the show that he likes

07:31.885 --> 07:32.884
with the string on it, you know?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.052
Yeah, yeah, you told me.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.287
And it did nothing.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.389
I know, you told me that. I did?

07:37.391 --> 07:39.057
Mm-hmm. Oh.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.058
Uh...

07:40.060 --> 07:41.960
Oh, did I tell you that I caught

07:41.962 --> 07:42.961
Todd at law school with him?

07:42.963 --> 07:43.795
Yes.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.964
I did?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.300
We covered a lot of ground
today, huh?

07:48.302 --> 07:49.968
We did. Yeah.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.470
Well, we had the whole ride in
to work together.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.138
Right, and coffee.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.806
Mm-hmm. You know, we
talked at coffee.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.408
And lunch. Right. And lunch.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.742
Drive home...

07:57.744 --> 08:00.812
Mm-hmm... from work
and then dinner.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.647
(chuckles)

08:04.818 --> 08:07.919
So, how does a tort fit into,

08:07.921 --> 08:10.822
say, a... malpractice case?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.424
Well, a tort is just

08:12.426 --> 08:13.825
an infringement on...
Uh, hang on a second, Ginger,

08:13.827 --> 08:14.960
'cause something tells me

08:14.962 --> 08:15.927
this isn't

08:15.929 --> 08:17.095
about torts.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.430
What do you mean?

08:18.432 --> 08:20.432
Of course it is.

08:20.434 --> 08:21.933
We have a big test...
Screw the test.

08:21.935 --> 08:22.934
This is about your dad,

08:22.936 --> 08:24.803
isn't it?

08:24.805 --> 08:25.604
We could help you.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.638
No,

08:26.640 --> 08:27.639
I couldn't ask you guys

08:27.641 --> 08:28.640
to waste time.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.275
Are you kidding me, bro?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.811
This place is a waste,
and you know it, too.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.446
That's why you
started practicing.

08:34.448 --> 08:35.280
I was wrong, Coop.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.948
No, you weren't.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.783
Everyone's all
hung up on degrees.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.785
Solving real cases...

08:40.787 --> 08:42.120
That's what it's about.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.788
They're right,

08:43.790 --> 08:44.990
and you know it.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.025
Come on, let us see the file.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.331
DEBBIE: <i>It's just that, like,</i>

08:53.333 --> 08:54.633
you know, now that we work

08:54.635 --> 08:56.167
together all day, every day,

08:56.169 --> 08:58.036
suddenly we have nothing to talk
about when we get home.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.305
That kind of thing can be
a real relationship killer.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.474
I know, right, so...
what should I do?

09:02.476 --> 09:04.809
I don't know, like,
drop some bombs.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.145
Pick a subject that
you guys disagree on...

09:07.147 --> 09:08.313
Uh-huh... And then bring it up,

09:08.315 --> 09:09.814
and stretch it out

09:09.816 --> 09:11.650
as long as you can, and then
bring it up again.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.151
So, like, something big?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.219
Something provocative, you know?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.387
(whispering): Provocative.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.488
Gives you something to do.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.390
Right.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.692
I'm worried about him, honestly.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.727
I'm afraid he's
teetering on the edge

09:22.729 --> 09:24.229
of falling back into...

09:24.231 --> 09:25.897
Into what? Well...

09:25.899 --> 09:27.899
the dramatic behavior

09:27.901 --> 09:29.167
that we've been
steering him away from.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.336
I-I feel like it's, you know,

09:31.338 --> 09:32.671
just poking its head
back up a little bit.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.072
Really? Yeah, a little bit.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.007
I hadn't noticed that at all.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.843
Well, I wonder...

09:38.845 --> 09:41.346
if he's not hiding it from you.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.348
God, Jillian, I just

09:43.350 --> 09:45.216
would hate to undo
all the progress

09:45.218 --> 09:46.551
you've made with him.
Why would you?

09:46.553 --> 09:47.385
I wouldn't.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.687
And I think just to

09:48.689 --> 09:49.721
make sure of that,

09:49.723 --> 09:51.389
what should I be careful

09:51.391 --> 09:54.893
to avoid that may set him back?

09:54.895 --> 09:59.731
Stewart, I think we need to
think of Dean as a drug addict.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.199
Mm-hmm. And...

10:01.201 --> 10:04.069
oddly, his drug of choice

10:04.071 --> 10:06.037
is bad television drama.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.739
Thank you.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.907
Nobody says that.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.076
It is. Yeah.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.945
So... what are we going to do?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.082
We are going to...

10:17.084 --> 10:18.083
keep him away

10:18.085 --> 10:19.250
from the drugs. Uh-huh.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.252
And...

10:21.455 --> 10:22.455
the people...

10:23.790 --> 10:25.457
he used to...? Used to...

10:25.459 --> 10:27.125
BOTH: Do...

10:27.127 --> 10:27.959
the drugs with.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.793
The drugs with.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.628
Yeah.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.562
The junkies.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.630
Now you're getting it.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.699
Or his dealer.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.141
Hello, Dean.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.075
A layover...

10:44.077 --> 10:45.477
in Boise. Yeah.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.312
It's turning into
quite the hub, you know.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.747
Well, even if that were true,

10:48.749 --> 10:50.482
that's not why you're here,
Cliff, come on.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.150
You got me.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.485
(chuckles)

10:53.487 --> 10:54.986
<i>Grinder: New Orleans.</i>

10:54.988 --> 10:57.656
I'm having trouble
with this one scene.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.823
It's a pivotal scene.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.824
It's the kind of scene

10:59.826 --> 11:00.992
I used to come to you with.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.227
Cliff...

11:03.430 --> 11:05.296
I don't do that anymore.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.098
I've moved on with my life.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.101
I don't know if you've heard,
but I'm in law school.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.936
You always had the thirst,
right?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.838
And I'm trying to quench it.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.342
The right way.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.480
We're in

11:22.482 --> 11:23.481
the desert.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.649
The dead of summer.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.284
Cliff, don't.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.452
It's a high-speed tank chase

11:27.454 --> 11:28.653
with a Mexican drug lord,

11:28.655 --> 11:30.121
and The Grinder's on the run...

11:30.123 --> 11:31.956
Oh, so, you're calling him
The Grinder now?

11:31.958 --> 11:33.958
Well, he's the new Grinder.
What do you want me to call him?

11:33.960 --> 11:34.959
The new Grinder.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.661
Or the fake Grinder.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.997
(whispering): Okay.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.300
I'm stuck on the new
Grinder's backstory.

11:42.302 --> 11:45.136
How does he know
how to drive a tank?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.639
I assume you've
already established

11:47.641 --> 11:49.374
that he has no formal
military training?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.709
You haven't lost your touch.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.310
But he could have been raised

11:52.312 --> 11:54.479
near an army base.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.547
We do the whole thing...

11:55.549 --> 11:56.648
BOTH: In flashbacks.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.216
And maybe-maybe he used

11:58.218 --> 12:00.318
to sneak onto the base
when he was a kid,

12:00.320 --> 12:01.686
you know, to escape
his parents fight...

12:01.688 --> 12:03.354
I'm sorry,
I can't-I can't do this.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.823
Dean-machine, come on,
we were just getting heated up.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.824
I'm sorry.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.991
I've come too far

12:06.993 --> 12:08.326
to get to where I am.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.248
I hope someday
you can understand.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.500
(Stewart clears throat)

12:15.502 --> 12:17.335
(sighing): Uh... What?

12:17.337 --> 12:20.004
Uh, I was just gonna
say good night.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.172
Yeah.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.894
Good night. Good night.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.790
(chuckles)

12:33.220 --> 12:35.220
So, I think I should
take Lizzie to the doctor

12:35.222 --> 12:36.387
to get some birth control pills.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.689
I'm up, I'm up.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.224
Are you? Yup.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.060
It just felt so right.

12:42.062 --> 12:46.564
You know, me riffing with Bemis
like the old days.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.066
That's what made it so hard...
Mm-hmm.

12:48.068 --> 12:51.069
To walk away, but I did.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.239
And I am so proud of you.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.573
(in baby voice):
Who's my big, strong baby?

12:55.575 --> 12:56.574
I am.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.909
Yeah.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.077
I just hope I can
continue to be.

12:59.079 --> 12:59.911
You can.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.412
You resisted,

13:01.414 --> 13:03.414
and that is growth. Right?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.916
'Cause how often is he
gonna get stuck enough that

13:04.918 --> 13:06.785
he flies out here
to fix a story?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.052
Yeah, really, I mean...

13:08.054 --> 13:09.454
Couldn't he have
just called you?

13:09.456 --> 13:10.889
Did he really need
to do it face-to-face?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.457
My point is...

13:12.459 --> 13:14.959
I resisted. Mm.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.394
And I couldn't have done
that without you.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.563
You have a bigger support
group than you know.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.799
Even your brother is committed
to your recovery now.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.801
He is? Yeah. He came
to see me yesterday

13:22.803 --> 13:24.402
to find out what triggers

13:24.404 --> 13:26.964
he should avoid that
might cause you to relapse.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.641
And what did you tell him?

13:29.643 --> 13:33.211
Exactly what he wanted me to.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.918
How could you? What?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.152
You know damn well what.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.153
You brought him here.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.488
Who? Cliff Bemis.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.489
To try to

13:44.491 --> 13:46.424
pull me back in

13:46.426 --> 13:49.427
and put at risk everything
that I've worked for.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.262
And all because you couldn't

13:51.264 --> 13:53.131
get your head around
this case, Counselor.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.465
Dean... Well, I am sorry,

13:54.467 --> 13:55.600
but I do not have

13:55.602 --> 13:56.935
all of the answers.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.603
I am just a first-year
law student.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.939
I know, and I am sorry.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.440
I pushed you too hard.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.608
I thought you were ready.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.809
You don't think I want to help?

14:04.811 --> 14:06.277
You don't think

14:06.279 --> 14:07.779
I want to get my father off?
I know...

14:07.781 --> 14:09.480
and I thought it was
the only way to win,

14:09.482 --> 14:11.950
but I realize now that it's not.

14:11.952 --> 14:12.984
It's not? No.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.953
Bemis is here.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.287
He's the one that
should be helping.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.622
I mean, he's an
expert in this stuff.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.958
He created<i> The Grinder,</i>

14:19.960 --> 14:21.326
the whole thing
came from his head.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.461
I wouldn't say that.
Well, he wrote it.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.630
You just said the lines
that he wrote.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.666
Oh, yeah, because
that's what actors do.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.368
They just say the lines

14:30.370 --> 14:32.203
and stand where they're
told and dance,

14:32.205 --> 14:33.304
like dummies.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.973
Yeah, Stew, actors do a lot more

14:34.975 --> 14:36.808
than that; Everybody knows it.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.643
I think you owe
someone an apology.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.645
No, Dad, he's done
enough already.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.780
I don't think
I have the strength...

14:43.984 --> 14:45.717
to weather any more pain.

14:48.989 --> 14:52.056
And then I told Stewart
that I was gonna take

14:52.058 --> 14:53.825
Lizzie to get
birth control pills.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.895
Wow, that's a big bomb.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I really went for it.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.832
And...? Completely
blew up in my face.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.333
Huh. Yeah, Stewart

15:02.335 --> 15:03.835
freaked out
and confronted Lizzie,

15:03.837 --> 15:05.670
and now she's not talking to me.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.672
Whew. Yeah.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.173
You know, I was afraid that
that would happen.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.341
I'm not so great with advice.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.543
Oh.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.711
Wish I had known that earlier.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.046
Yeah. (Chuckles)

15:15.048 --> 15:16.547
I don't think this quite works.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.383
Here, I don't know if that...

15:18.385 --> 15:19.384
Bemis.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.551
What are you doing here?

15:20.553 --> 15:21.719
Oh, I'm just

15:21.721 --> 15:22.720
showing him the case files.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.855
See if anything clicks.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.856
You want to join us?

15:24.858 --> 15:26.057
No, it's okay.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.392
I, uh, I actually have

15:27.394 --> 15:28.893
some studying to do, so...

15:28.895 --> 15:31.396
don't mind me.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.697
So, what do you think?

15:32.699 --> 15:33.898
Does this feel like a setup?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.233
Oh, yeah.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.068
Yeah, this is
reeking of a setup.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.237
Actually, it reminds
me of a revenge arc

15:39.239 --> 15:40.571
I came up with in season five.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.073
(snorts)

15:42.075 --> 15:43.241
Go on.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.411
Well, I was spinning my wheels.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.712
Yeah, the writers had nothing.

15:47.714 --> 15:48.713
The network

15:48.715 --> 15:50.248
had nothing, but I...

15:50.250 --> 15:51.582
I knew something was missing.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.284
Was it realism?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.453
Quality? No, that was
there, but it needed

15:55.455 --> 15:58.056
a twist. (Exhales slowly)

15:58.058 --> 15:59.457
I remember being all by myself,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.459
no one else around,
and hearing a voice

16:01.461 --> 16:05.630
inside my head say,
"Clifford, what if

16:05.632 --> 16:07.632
Mitch were behind
the whole thing?"

16:07.634 --> 16:09.133
STEWART: Oh, wow.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.969
(echoing):
From inside your head?

16:10.971 --> 16:13.404
BEMIS (echoing): Yup, yup,
yup, cracked it wide open.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.073
There's nothing as rewarding

16:15.075 --> 16:16.240
as cracking something

16:16.242 --> 16:19.043
with no help from anyone else.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.746
Really?! You cracked it?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.315
Because I remember
writing a character journal

16:24.317 --> 16:25.550
that...

16:27.988 --> 16:29.153
It doesn't matter.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.488
Okay.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.825
I am going to take a drive.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.594
He'll be back. Yeah...

16:36.596 --> 16:37.795
I don't really care.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.098
Let's get back to
my end of the deal.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.267
When's my dinner with Idaho's
sexiest lawyer? I...

16:43.269 --> 16:44.102
I'm working on it.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.503
Work faster.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.941
Really? What?

16:49.943 --> 16:50.942
I'm not some piece of meat

16:50.944 --> 16:52.944
you can just trade for favors.

16:52.946 --> 16:55.313
Uh, no...

16:55.315 --> 16:56.781
<i>you're</i> not.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.450
Cliff Bemis wants
to have dinner with me?

16:59.452 --> 17:00.952
Yeah, he wants
to get to know you.

17:00.954 --> 17:01.953
Uh, just being a

17:01.955 --> 17:02.954
die-hard fan...

17:02.956 --> 17:04.322
Well, I guess that makes sense.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.957
Right? So, what
time are we going?

17:05.959 --> 17:06.958
It's just the two of you.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.459
Oh. Yeah. One on one.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.294
Okay. And just, uh...

17:10.296 --> 17:12.130
just be...

17:12.132 --> 17:13.297
open.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.133
Open to...?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.868
To... whatever.

17:16.870 --> 17:17.969
You don't want to disappoint

17:17.971 --> 17:18.970
Cliff Bemis, now, do you?

17:18.972 --> 17:20.371
No. Great, great.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.708
Oh, and, Todd,
wear something nice.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.311
COOPER: <i>Dude, your brother might
have been on to something.</i>

17:27.313 --> 17:29.647
There's something shady here.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.983
Is that the law talking,
or your gut?

17:31.985 --> 17:33.051
It's my gut.

17:33.987 --> 17:36.320
I used to listen to my gut.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.221
Why'd you stop?

17:37.223 --> 17:38.556
I don't know.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.358
I'm sorry, I'm just not
myself today.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.659
What's on your mind?

17:41.661 --> 17:42.560
Talk to us.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.494
Don't you get it, Ginger?

17:43.496 --> 17:44.495
This is the moment.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.229
We're watching it.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.230
What-what moment?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.832
The calm before the storm.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.501
Right before The Grinder
saves the day.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.736
The Grinder's a character.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.571
It's not me.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.673
Well, what if you're wrong?

17:55.675 --> 17:59.243
What if The Grinder
is who you really are?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.048
MAN (over television):
<i>No, swipe left.</i>

18:04.050 --> 18:05.716
Bro, it's literally asking you
one question.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.418
MAN 2:
I think that's two, technically.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.419
MAN 1: Whatever, man.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.701
Are you still not talking to me?

18:11.057 --> 18:12.356
Honey, I'm sorry.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.691
Is this about
the birth control stuff?

18:13.693 --> 18:14.892
Oh, he knows now, too?

18:14.894 --> 18:15.893
Are you just telling everybody?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.428
I'm not telling everybody.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.529
Just because you guys have
nothing to talk about?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.697
Who has nothing to talk about?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.232
You and Mom.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.900
What? Yeah, that's why
she betrayed our trust.

18:22.902 --> 18:23.901
And for what?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.403
Some cheap conversation.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.238
That's why you told me that?
I was desperate.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.873
Honey!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.374
Birth control is...
That's a big swing.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.243
Huge. So, how about
you guys don't

18:32.245 --> 18:34.078
talk as much at work,
and save it for home

18:34.080 --> 18:35.413
so it doesn't have
to be about me?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.081
That's not a bad idea.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.116
That's a good idea, right?

18:38.118 --> 18:39.717
Yeah, that could
definitely work.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.119
It doesn't have to be
a whole thing when I see you.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.286
No, we could just
smile in the hallway.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.788
Ships in the night. I like that.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.789
Great, so we don't have to talk

18:44.791 --> 18:46.124
about my personal life anymore?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.792
Honey, that's all we're
gonna talk about now.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.626
(whispering): Oh, God.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.361
I'm sorry.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.402
Todd said you wanted to see me.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.971
Let me guess.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.139
Bemis was of no help?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.075
No, because he doesn't care.

19:04.077 --> 19:04.976
But you do, Dean.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.144
Is that all?

19:06.146 --> 19:07.478
Because I've got midterms

19:07.480 --> 19:09.147
and I've got to study.

19:09.149 --> 19:12.150
Dean, that's not you
and you know it.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.253
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

19:15.255 --> 19:18.489
but I think Dad
was actually right.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.991
We can do this together.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.913
Better than I can do it
by myself.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.265
I've waited a long time
for you to say those words.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.933
Maybe a lifetime.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.601
But it's too late.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.103
I'm sorry.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.438
Anyway, I just got
to run in for a second.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.541
Todd's written a paper for me.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.612
DEAN: My God,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.147
wha-what happened?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.709
Someone broke in
and destroyed the place.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.119
You still think I'm crazy?

19:48.121 --> 19:50.188
(sighs)

19:57.797 --> 19:58.796
You're breaking up with me?

19:58.798 --> 19:59.964
I-I'm afraid so.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.466
Why?!

20:02.468 --> 20:03.868
Tell me why!

20:03.870 --> 20:06.037
Because it...

20:06.973 --> 20:08.706
You don't want any part of this.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.474
The man that you
fell in love with...

20:10.476 --> 20:12.310
it's not who I am.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.711
It was a character

20:13.713 --> 20:15.479
that I was playing because

20:15.481 --> 20:16.647
that's what I do.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.649
What about our therapy?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.818
Yeah, I think I think I need to
see somebody else for that, too.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.386
Why?!

20:22.388 --> 20:24.555
Tell me why!

20:24.557 --> 20:25.489
I think you know why.

20:25.491 --> 20:26.891
Dean...

20:28.161 --> 20:31.562
The Grinder<i> is</i> the character.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.833
But what if it isn't?

20:35.835 --> 20:39.403
What if The Grinder
is who I really am?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.906
I mean...

20:41.908 --> 20:43.007
I doubt it.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.576
Good-bye, Jillian.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.215
("To Know You Is to Love You"
plays)

20:51.217 --> 20:52.717
Good-bye.

20:52.719 --> 20:56.554
¶ To know, know, know him ¶

20:56.556 --> 21:00.558
¶ Is to love, love, love him ¶

21:00.560 --> 21:05.563
¶ Just to see him smile ¶

21:05.565 --> 21:09.367
¶ Makes my life worthwhile... ¶

21:09.369 --> 21:10.568
(indistinct conversation
under instrumental interlude)

21:10.570 --> 21:12.336
(both laugh)

21:36.462 --> 21:38.963
From the ashes...

21:40.967 --> 21:43.034
he rises.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.053
