Dear David Bowie...

00:56.348 --> 01:01.311
Well, it's Monday morning, which,
let's face it, in Cincinnati, is redundant.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.313
I'm getting ready for school,
or, as I like to call it,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.775
Guantรกnamo with a lunch period.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.361
My mom says
that's seeing the glass half-empty.

01:09.527 --> 01:12.614
Personally, I just hope one day
to actually see the glass.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.908
Will, you're going to be late.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.743
Will?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.913
Are you writing another letter
to David Bowie?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.540
Doesn't it bother you
that he never writes back?

01:22.707 --> 01:29.172
- He knows that would only intimidate me.
- See, why can't I process rejection like that?

01:30.048 --> 01:32.801
Good. Let's go.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.722
So, what does the white whale
symbolize here?

01:37.889 --> 01:41.434
School isn't gut-wrenchingly awful.

01:41.601 --> 01:46.314
Mostly, it's just kind of like novocaine
for the soul.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.025
I tend to make snap judgments
about people

01:49.192 --> 01:53.780
based on what kind of music they like.
Like these kids are into hip-hop lite,

01:53.947 --> 01:57.867
the kind where some rapper does one verse
of a Christina Aguilera song.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.786
Then there's the "Trustafarians. "

01:59.953 --> 02:05.500
Rich suburban white kids with knit caps
and $2,000 dreadlocks extensions.

02:05.667 --> 02:09.461
The indie-rock clique is made up of me
and one other kid I refuse to meet

02:09.628 --> 02:13.550
until he bathes
and stops flattening his hair with his hand.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.968
What can I say?

02:15.135 --> 02:20.598
I think I just kind of missed the memo
about how to fit in in Cincinnati.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.893
I'm sorry. That was an accident.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.478
- Dewey.
Dewey!

02:25.645 --> 02:26.813
Dewey!

02:26.980 --> 02:30.150
Oh, well. As a wise musician once said,

02:30.316 --> 02:34.029
"I have become comfortably numb. "

02:38.992 --> 02:41.369
Well, that's all for now.

02:41.536 --> 02:45.206
Your number-one fan, Will Burton.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.343
What's the one thing I could say right now
to make this better?

02:56.509 --> 02:59.137
You quit your job
and we're moving out of Cincinnati?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.723
I quit my job
and we're moving out of Cincinnati.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.894
- You're a cat and I'm just your play toy.
- No, no, I mean it, I mean it.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.146
- Aunt Nan gave me a job.
- In Jersey?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.982
Yeah! Yeah, and it's more money,
and flexible hours...

03:11.149 --> 03:13.610
- Seriously?
- Yeah! And it's perfect.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.488
The schools in Jersey
start second semester later.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.865
Mom!

03:22.410 --> 03:23.328
What? What is it?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.914
I mean, it's not going
to be any different there.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.334
Okay, there's the Will Burton
I know and love.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.378
God, for a moment,
you were actually possessed

03:31.544 --> 03:34.547
by a happy, well-adjusted teenager.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.510
- It might be different. Different kids.
- Yeah, but same me.

03:38.677 --> 03:43.264
Hey, hey. You are not the problem.
You are terrific.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.935
Will.

03:47.435 --> 03:51.898
Listen, honey, if you miss out on life,
they win.

03:56.444 --> 04:01.032
- If you just put your hand in mine
- If you just put your hand in mine

04:01.199 --> 04:05.453
- We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
- We're gonna leave all our troubles behind

04:05.620 --> 04:08.498
- We'll walk and don't look back
- We'll walk and don't look back

04:08.665 --> 04:11.001
- Don't look back
- Don't look back

04:11.167 --> 04:13.545
Okay, Mick Jagger recorded this
with Peter Tosh.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.464
It's almost ska.
It's like reggae, but it pops more,

04:16.630 --> 04:19.175
and they don't sing about Jah.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.511
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.555
No.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.975
But it's nice to see you so happy!

04:27.142 --> 04:29.394
Lodi!

04:41.781 --> 04:46.244
Will, honey, it's a big day tomorrow.
Get to bed.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.095
Well?

05:04.262 --> 05:05.930
Elvis is entering the building.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.558
- Unharmed?
- Completely.

05:08.725 --> 05:13.438
All right!
See, I told you it would be different here.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.818
Night and day.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.612
Dear David Bowie,

05:20.779 --> 05:25.617
there's one big advantage to
my new school over my old one: anonymity.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.995
All those years of wishing I could
make myself invisible?

05:29.162 --> 05:33.667
Turns out, all I had to do
was move to New Jersey.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.677
Happy New Year, Van Buren! What's up?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.970
I just have one question for you.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.973
What's gonna happen
3, 600 hours from right now?

05:49.140 --> 05:52.185
- Bandslam!
- Bandslam!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.771
And who's gonna bring home the gold?

05:54.938 --> 05:55.897
- Glory Dogs!
- Glory Dogs!

05:56.064 --> 06:00.360
Give it up for Ben Wheatly
and the Glory Dogs!

06:03.988 --> 06:07.826
Lunch today was like
a Nuremberg rally produced by MTV.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.494
Yes, you're number one!

06:09.661 --> 06:12.080
Out of nowhere,
people were acting like maniacs

06:12.247 --> 06:14.124
over something called Bandslam.

06:14.290 --> 06:18.294
- I love you, Ben!
What's up, Van Buren?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.883
All right.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.846
As we all know, last year at Bandslam,

06:28.013 --> 06:32.767
the Glory Dogs tied for second
with the Burning Hotels.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.814
Well, that's not happening this year.
You know why?

06:37.981 --> 06:38.982
Why?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.860
'Cause there's some new dogs
in the pound.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.195
First up, all the way from Montclair,

06:44.362 --> 06:48.158
Living with his dad, who he hates,
just to play with the Dogs:.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.869
Dylan Dyer!

07:08.053 --> 07:11.681
Exactly how big is
this whole Bandslam thing around here?

07:11.848 --> 07:15.393
Texas high-school-football big.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.812
- You're new.
- Yeah.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.524
Let me see your class schedule.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.330
We have Human Studies together.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.333
What's your name?

07:39.042 --> 07:41.753
Will Burton. What's yours?

07:41.920 --> 07:46.758
Last, but certainly not least,
everybody loves a drummer.

07:47.509 --> 07:51.471
We got a bad boy on the kit,
and his name is Boe!

07:51.638 --> 07:54.557
The "5" is silent.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.283
Kit is crazy.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.785
Incredible.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.371
- What are you doing?
- Let me have a...

08:16.538 --> 08:19.499
What are you doing?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.011
Dear David Bowie,

08:32.178 --> 08:35.347
today in my Human Studies class,
our teacher, Miss Wittenberg,

08:35.515 --> 08:40.186
said the two words I dread more
than any others in the English language.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.105
Buddy up.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.108
This semester,
I want you to pick someone in the class

08:45.275 --> 08:50.739
and create a presentation
that will show us who that person truly is.

08:51.698 --> 08:56.995
Now, you can use photography,
poetry, video. Get creative, people.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.123
You'll have to get together after school.

09:00.290 --> 09:05.003
We're gonna know each other
in ways we never expected.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.594
Do you want to start?

09:12.761 --> 09:14.346
What's your favorite color?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.556
Come on. I mean,
we have to dig a little deeper than that.

09:16.723 --> 09:21.019
This project counts for, like, half our grade.

09:23.480 --> 09:28.651
Look, why don't we take each other
to, like, our most favorite spot

09:28.818 --> 09:31.196
and our least favorite spot
in the whole world?

09:31.363 --> 09:32.739
Okay.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.658
Least favorite?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.287
Done.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.874
Most favorite?

09:43.041 --> 09:46.878
- Can I get back to you on that?
- Why do you talk like that?

09:47.045 --> 09:49.047
- Like what?
- Like that.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.591
Why do you look like that?

09:51.758 --> 09:55.011
- I just do.
- Same here.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.848
I used to stutter.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.560
Emotion is overrated.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.189
There may be a middle ground.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.609
Idiots.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.112
Morons.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.830
Open. Right now.
Right now, right now, right now.

10:21.996 --> 10:26.459
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Do not come near me!

10:32.674 --> 10:33.591
Are you all right?

10:33.758 --> 10:37.429
If anything happened to my cello,
I'm going to sue his parents.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.555
Seems all right.

10:38.722 --> 10:44.227
It's impossible to tell until you play it.
It's not like it's a viola.

10:50.775 --> 10:54.654
Hey! Hey, Good Samaritan,
do you like kids?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.115
- What?
- Do you like kids? It's a simple question.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.658
Of course you do.
All Good Samaritans like kids.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.619
It's in the handbook.
Come on, we don't have a lot of time.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.039
What?

11:06.332 --> 11:09.502
- What is this?
- This is a daycare program

11:09.669 --> 11:14.924
our fair school set up
with Lindsay Elementary around the corner.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.348
- Beef jerky! Beef Jerky!
- Beef jerky! Beef Jerky!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.768
Beef jerky. Teriyaki flavor.
They... They love it.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.019
Beef Jerky!
- Beef Jerky!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.645
Okay, ready?

11:27.812 --> 11:29.939
You.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.733
Who's...

11:31.900 --> 11:32.817
Oh, uh...

11:32.984 --> 11:36.488
That's Mr. Berry. He "supervises. "

11:36.654 --> 11:40.533
All right, everybody, sit down.
Come on, monsters.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.661
- Name?
- Will. Will Burton.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.246
Charlotte Barnes.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.918
Ladies and gentlemen,
Will Burton is in the house!

11:53.713 --> 11:56.758
Can I have your iPod?

11:57.676 --> 11:59.386
Hey, Rory,
you want to listen to some of Will's music?

11:59.552 --> 12:03.098
Is it like your band? Glory Dogs rock.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.975
Ex-band, Rory.

12:09.979 --> 12:14.526
- They're not gonna want to listen to that.
- Halt.

12:18.655 --> 12:22.200
Way to soothe the savage beast.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.207
You are a weirdo, aren't you, Will Burton?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.550
She wants you to do this every week?

12:38.717 --> 12:40.427
You know, just 'cause someone
tells you to do something

12:40.593 --> 12:42.637
doesn't mean you have to do it.

12:42.804 --> 12:43.763
Why is she still here?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.391
I thought you trained these dogs
at Aunt Nan's kennel.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.311
She's getting placed tomorrow,
with a lady who has tummy issues.

12:50.478 --> 12:54.190
Yeah. Right, Mazzy? Mazzy, Maalox.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.945
So, now, since when are you so interested
in daycare?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.656
Since when do you talk to the dogs
like that?

13:01.823 --> 13:06.578
Since when did you get so good
at changing the subject?

13:08.830 --> 13:14.044
- That's appetizing.
- Yeah, and it's not Maalox. Mazzy, Maalox.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.505
So, what's this Charlotte like?

13:17.672 --> 13:20.925
Not only is she the coolest person
who's ever spoken to me,

13:21.092 --> 13:24.804
she's potentially the coolest person
on the whole planet.

13:24.971 --> 13:29.434
But please,
don't make a big deal about it, okay?

13:30.852 --> 13:31.978
- Is she pretty?
- Mom!

13:32.145 --> 13:34.189
We are not going to sit here,
do each other's nails

13:34.356 --> 13:38.818
and gossip about crushes, okay?
Not gonna happen.

13:45.241 --> 13:50.246
Tylenol is not Maalox.
Well, it's not a bad idea. High five!

14:15.480 --> 14:17.190
You walk home from school?

14:17.357 --> 14:21.736
School bus waits for no one.
Not even art class.

14:22.278 --> 14:26.282
Hey, want to see the coolest place ever?

14:40.296 --> 14:44.259
- My dad used to bring me here.
- Is he dead?

14:44.426 --> 14:45.885
No. Take it back.

14:46.052 --> 14:51.182
I take it back. Sorry.
Just the way you were talking about him.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.769
No, I'm sorry.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.106
It's just last summer he got sick,

14:58.273 --> 15:03.737
and I don't like putting stuff like that
into the universe, you know?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.743
Can I ask a question?

15:09.993 --> 15:12.078
You're a senior.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.207
- Was that the end of the question?
- Why are you hanging out with me?

15:16.374 --> 15:20.253
I don't do whys.
Okay. The Velvet Underground.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.964
If I'm going to teach you the basics,
we might as well start with the best.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.591
Well, actually,
if we're gonna start with the Velvets,

15:24.758 --> 15:29.137
I'd rather listen to the 1969 self-titled
The Velvet Underground.

15:29.304 --> 15:34.559
Unless you think the band went downhill
when Lou Reed fired John Cale.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.312
Who are you?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.856
Will.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.859
Do you know a lot about music?

15:43.026 --> 15:44.361
Yeah.

15:44.527 --> 15:48.323
- Why hasn't this come up before?
- We didn't really have a before.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.200
Good point.

15:50.367 --> 15:54.162
- My dad's a musician.
- No way. Have I heard of him?

15:54.329 --> 15:58.041
No, he's what they call a sideman.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.585
If The Who need a keyboard
during their tour,

16:00.752 --> 16:03.338
or Sonic Youth wants a synth part
on a track...

16:03.505 --> 16:06.841
Wait, he tours with The Who?

16:07.008 --> 16:12.347
I know it sounds cool, but I mean,
it just means he's never around.

16:13.098 --> 16:16.643
That's why my mom divorced him.

16:18.269 --> 16:22.857
So, what's the deal with the whole
Bandslam thing? It's like a town obsession.

16:23.024 --> 16:27.404
Yeah. That's because the winner
gets an actual bona fide record deal.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.865
Seriously?
Yep. Seriously.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.460
Do any other bands from the school enter?

16:42.627 --> 16:48.008
Going up against Glory Dogs
would be like burning the American flag.

16:52.429 --> 16:57.058
- Then why'd you quit?
- I told you, I don't do whys.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.231
Besides, I'm thinking
of starting another band.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.358
Hey, come hear us jam on Saturday.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.237
Give us the benefit
of your vast musical knowledge.

17:09.404 --> 17:15.117
- I don't really do well in groups.
- Always do the thing that scares you.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.542
Hello, London!

17:41.644 --> 17:44.689
I want you to want me

17:45.774 --> 17:48.818
I need you to need me

17:49.819 --> 17:53.281
I'd love you to love me, yeah

17:54.282 --> 17:57.744
And I'm begging you to beg me

17:58.745 --> 18:02.957
Shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand-new shirt

18:03.124 --> 18:07.712
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

18:09.631 --> 18:13.593
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

18:13.760 --> 18:17.972
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.293
- Who's this?
- Oh!

18:47.460 --> 18:50.755
Hey! This would be the coolest kid ever.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.800
Knows absolutely everything about music.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.929
Guys, this is Will. Will, this is guys.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.641
- What's up?
- So, what do you think?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.476
I mean, it's pretty tasty, huh?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.938
Did you catch how, like, my bass line,
it shadowed his lead guitar?

19:07.105 --> 19:11.026
I mean, it was almost like I was a bodyguard
for his riff, dude. He was like...

19:11.192 --> 19:13.903
And I was like... And he was like...
And I was like... And he was like...

19:14.070 --> 19:18.742
Dear David Bowie, how do you tell
Pinocchio he'll never be a real boy?

19:18.908 --> 19:21.036
Okay, okay!

19:21.202 --> 19:23.204
Okay!

19:23.371 --> 19:25.582
Look, I know you're going for this kind of

19:25.749 --> 19:28.126
Thin Lizzy, dual guitar,
third-above harmony.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.462
- Right.
- But, I mean, it's tough, sonically,

19:30.628 --> 19:33.631
to pull off, because you can't
get the bass sound fat enough,

19:33.798 --> 19:38.053
or even in the same octave
to create any real presence.

19:38.219 --> 19:42.640
Especially if your instruments
aren't exactly tuned to each other.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.851
- I bloody well told you!
- Did you? When?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.979
Bug, you stupid git, I don't need any
more of your bloody nonsense.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.065
I don't need any
of your bloody Englishisms.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.609
You're not English, Omar, you are
from Newark. Get that hand out of my...

19:52.776 --> 19:55.695
Hey, wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Can it.

19:55.862 --> 19:59.574
Look, we were afraid of sounding too slick.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.535
No, you're safe.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.995
What else?

20:04.162 --> 20:05.914
I mean,
they don't really want to hear what I...

20:06.081 --> 20:06.998
No, what else?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.668
I can't stress how badly
you need an actual drummer.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.796
Well, what about me, then?

20:12.962 --> 20:15.965
No offense, but it seems
like you're trying way too hard

20:16.132 --> 20:19.344
to be Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.804
I am not.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.683
Okay. It's just with all the jumping around
and the shorts...

20:24.849 --> 20:27.435
Come on, man. I don't want to be Flea.
I don't even like Flea.

20:27.602 --> 20:31.189
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Bug.

20:31.606 --> 20:35.068
- I mean, what's the band called, anyway?
- Glory Dogs.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.112
Isn't that the name of the other band?

20:37.278 --> 20:40.156
No. They're Ben Wheatly
and the Glory Dogs.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.659
Like Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band,

20:42.826 --> 20:46.037
or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
You get it?

20:46.204 --> 20:50.083
That way, he can fire whoever he wants to
whenever he wants to,

20:50.250 --> 20:52.585
and it stays his band.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.337
Look, are we through here,
because I'm starving.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.966
Yes. Come on.
So, Will, every Saturday at noon, right here.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.009
And don't be late.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.511
So, Omar, where exactly in England
is New Jersey?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.013
Bug, leave it out.

21:03.179 --> 21:06.683
Miles Feltenstien is a puzzle.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.396
An enigma.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.903
A sphinx.

21:21.531 --> 21:27.203
- So, I guess we should get together again.
Okay, sure. What about your house?

21:27.370 --> 21:29.539
Can you have friends over?

21:29.706 --> 21:33.001
Friends. Don't have those.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.712
Me neither.

21:37.088 --> 21:41.051
Maybe we could not have friends together.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.471
Actually, I might have one friend.
You know Charlotte Barnes?

21:44.637 --> 21:48.433
- Since I was 10. She's a senior.
- Yeah, I thought that was weird, too.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.186
So there's a 50% chance
that I might be the punch line

21:51.353 --> 21:53.897
to some elaborate practical joke,

21:54.064 --> 21:57.609
but she seems pretty sincere.
Are you friends?

21:57.776 --> 22:01.196
Ever hear a stutterer laugh?

22:01.404 --> 22:03.573
Ha.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.910
- Be careful, Will.
- Why?

22:07.077 --> 22:10.872
Leopards and cheerleaders
don't change their spots.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.874
She's a cheerleader?

22:13.041 --> 22:16.836
Was. Last year. Junior prom queen, too.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.715
That's amazing to me.
I mean, she seems so...

22:20.882 --> 22:22.300
Not.

22:22.467 --> 22:26.137
She's got her own Wikipedia page.

22:48.952 --> 22:52.872
You're head cheerleader?
I read your Wikipedia page.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.960
Was. That was last year. Another life.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.589
Hey, I notice you never say anything
about my vocals.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.800
Afraid I'll stop being your friend
if you rip me a new one?

23:03.967 --> 23:06.845
What? No. You're amazing.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.222
- Don't get infatuated with me.
- I'm not getting infatuated with you!

23:09.389 --> 23:14.394
Please, Louise!
You'd eat my laundry for a month if I asked.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.064
But I'm never going to ask you, Will.

23:18.231 --> 23:22.736
This has just become
my new least favorite memory.

23:23.987 --> 23:27.407
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.749
Hey, Charlotte.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.003
- What's up, guys?
Hey.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.130
What's going on? Omar.

23:42.297 --> 23:45.467
Hey, you got a little something
on your upper lip there.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.303
Don't talk to him.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.139
Why? All right, what did I do?

23:51.306 --> 23:53.141
Do you have a head injury?

23:53.308 --> 23:54.851
I did not screw them over.

23:55.018 --> 23:58.605
I have a chance to play with my heroes,
you know?

23:58.772 --> 24:01.733
Dylan Dyer is an artist, right, Omar?
You said so yourself.

24:01.900 --> 24:05.236
- He's all right.
- "He's all right"? The guy's a monster!

24:05.403 --> 24:08.573
- Well, what about loyalty?
- No one's saying you aren't good,

24:08.740 --> 24:11.576
'cause you guys are good.
You guys are really good.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.328
We just have to be great, you know?

24:13.495 --> 24:16.414
And sometimes you just have to realize
when it's time to step aside.

24:16.581 --> 24:19.501
- Like right now. I have tables.
Why are you being like this?

24:19.668 --> 24:23.505
You quit before any of this
even happened with them.

24:23.672 --> 24:27.300
All right, can we just please
go somewhere and talk?

24:27.467 --> 24:29.803
- I'm working.
- Okay, then tomorrow, after last period.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.055
- I'm hanging out with Will.
- Who the heck is Will?

24:32.222 --> 24:35.934
That the heck is Will.
Say hello, the heck is Will.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.269
Hi.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.313
You gotta be kidding me.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.651
Will happens to be my friend
and the manager of my new band.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.528
- Whoa! Hey.
- What?

24:46.695 --> 24:49.906
- Your band? You guys are a band now?
- Yeah.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.534
- And he's your manager?
Yeah.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.911
- This is crazy!
- Holla.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.538
It gets worse.

24:56.705 --> 25:00.333
This year, Van Buren's
sending two bands to Bandslam.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.501
What? What? No.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.086
You guys are going up against Glory Dogs?

25:03.253 --> 25:06.172
We are Glory Dogs!

25:07.507 --> 25:11.469
You have changed, Charlotte.
Everybody says so.

25:11.636 --> 25:14.556
Everybody's right.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.150
My cell phone died.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.736
- So, what happened?
- I got caught up.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.237
All day?

25:29.404 --> 25:31.740
With Charlotte.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.908
I'm managing her band.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.828
You're what?
I thought you were doing daycare.

25:36.995 --> 25:41.374
- She's very demanding.
- Well, shouldn't we talk about this?

25:41.541 --> 25:44.627
No. I think we should trust me.

25:44.794 --> 25:45.962
Well, I do trust you.

25:46.129 --> 25:49.674
It's just that five minutes ago
you were afraid to get on a school bus,

25:49.841 --> 25:51.843
and now you're managing a band.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.679
It's all just moving a little fast,
don't you think?

25:54.846 --> 25:57.140
I made some friends, Mom.

25:57.307 --> 26:01.686
I know.
It's uncharted territory for both of us.

26:12.781 --> 26:14.074
Twizzler?

26:14.240 --> 26:17.077
Food of the gods.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.875
It's ska.

26:25.085 --> 26:26.670
I like it.

26:26.836 --> 26:31.716
- It's like reggae, but they made it their own.
- Exactly.

26:31.883 --> 26:34.344
There you are. Hey.

26:34.511 --> 26:38.223
Wait. Don't tell me you're the world-famous
Sa5m-the-5-is-silent.

26:38.390 --> 26:41.518
For that alone, you are my hero.

26:41.685 --> 26:46.439
- I'm Charlotte. Nice to meet you.
- I've known you since fifth grade.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.275
You used to babysit me.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.569
Huh.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.781
Come on. Time for the ankle-biters.
They'll eat their own if we're late.

26:54.948 --> 26:59.494
- Are we still gonna meet up after school?
- Yeah, it's a date.

26:59.661 --> 27:04.207
Not like a "date" date. You know,
we're just working on a project for class.

27:04.374 --> 27:06.876
- It's not like we're dating.
- She gets it, Will.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.754
Okay. See you.

27:10.380 --> 27:13.883
Nice seeing you again, Sa5m-the-5-is-silent.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.386
Genius.

27:20.348 --> 27:21.808
Dear David Bowie,

27:21.975 --> 27:25.937
despite my usual worries and fears
and complaints,

27:26.104 --> 27:30.316
Van Buren does not actually
completely suck.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.245
As for the band,
they finally agreed to add a drummer,

27:42.412 --> 27:45.206
but only if it's Basher Martin.

27:45.373 --> 27:48.710
Apparently, he's the best drummer
in school,

27:48.877 --> 27:52.714
but all he takes are auto shop
and anger management classes.

27:52.881 --> 27:54.966
Which he failed.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.427
Twice.

27:59.971 --> 28:03.350
I just have to be cool.
I just have to walk right up to him and say...

28:03.516 --> 28:05.810
Drums.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.399
What about them?

28:13.318 --> 28:15.779
Look. You can either say
what's on your mind,

28:15.945 --> 28:18.031
or take your little afro
and go ahead and scurry back...

28:18.198 --> 28:20.658
You play.

28:21.576 --> 28:24.496
Wow, this is hard.

28:24.913 --> 28:28.750
I'm Will. I manage this awesome band.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.961
We need a drummer for Bandslam.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.046
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

28:33.213 --> 28:37.008
You know, I need things in my life
that keep me calm.

28:37.175 --> 28:38.927
You know,
I hate the whole Bandslam thing.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.680
It's just a bunch of lemmings
chasing after a record deal,

28:41.846 --> 28:45.642
but they don't care about their art.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.144
You know, I care about art.

28:48.311 --> 28:51.731
And if you do too,
then how can this be enough for you?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.359
I mean, you're a musician,

28:54.526 --> 28:57.445
and here you are going through life,
passing people every day,

28:57.612 --> 29:02.242
and no one knows that inside,
you're this golden god.

29:03.326 --> 29:06.871
Don't you feel like Clark Kent?

29:08.039 --> 29:11.751
I do kind of feel like Clark Kent.

29:14.796 --> 29:18.675
Look, I'll tell you what.
Have them make a rehearsal demo.

29:18.842 --> 29:20.510
I'll check it out, see how they sound.

29:20.677 --> 29:24.097
No. That would be like licking the pages
of a cookbook.

29:24.264 --> 29:28.435
You have to actually go hear them.
Play with them.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.396
Make them great.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.609
Who's the babe?

29:36.776 --> 29:40.905
I dig older chicks 'cause they're
the only ones who really get me.

29:41.072 --> 29:43.158
That's my...

29:43.324 --> 29:45.994
Older sister.

29:46.327 --> 29:49.789
Well, she actually hangs out with the band,
like, all the time.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.625
All the time.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.589
So, you know...

30:01.551 --> 30:05.764
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

30:06.014 --> 30:10.226
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

30:12.145 --> 30:13.521
I can't believe I'm doing this.

30:13.688 --> 30:16.900
I have a very slim shot at being popular
if this whole band thing works out.

30:17.067 --> 30:20.153
You can help me do it.

30:21.363 --> 30:23.615
He is 17 years old!

30:23.782 --> 30:26.868
He likes older chicks.

30:30.455 --> 30:31.581
I look ridiculous.

30:31.748 --> 30:36.878
No, you look great. We'll run you
through a carwash on the way home.

30:37.045 --> 30:41.508
- How old did you tell him I was?
- Twenty-three.

30:48.306 --> 30:49.516
God!

30:49.683 --> 30:51.768
Dude, that was sick.

30:51.935 --> 30:55.355
Look, it was obviously better,
but we still need a fuller sound.

30:55.522 --> 30:56.898
- What?
- I'm thinking we bring in

30:57.065 --> 30:57.982
some more players, just for Bandslam.

30:58.149 --> 31:00.944
That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
Get out of my house.

31:01.111 --> 31:05.115
- We don't need any more players!
- Hey!

31:05.573 --> 31:07.784
We have a guest.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.869
Hi. Thanks.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.706
And Will's right. We probably should
bring in some other players.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.543
- You mean, like, use sidemen?
- Hold on, wait. Use what men?

31:16.710 --> 31:18.503
Sidemen. Will's dad is a sideman.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.756
Plays with lots of famous bands.
Is that what you meant, Will?

31:21.923 --> 31:25.010
Will's dad is joining the band?

31:25.176 --> 31:30.223
... these huge stadium crowds at that time,
and I'm thinking,

31:30.682 --> 31:32.976
"What are these people doing here?
Why have they come to see me?

31:33.143 --> 31:36.229
"They should be seeing Phil Collins.
They were definitely... "

31:36.396 --> 31:40.692
I'm taking a shower.
I'm taking three showers.

31:42.569 --> 31:43.695
Will, what's a sideman?

31:43.862 --> 31:46.239
'... your mother and I,
we tried to protect you from all this,

31:46.406 --> 31:49.200
"but... Well, if you must know,
your sister ran away. "

31:49.367 --> 31:53.413
"Why did you kill Ziggy?"
It was hard for all of us...

31:53.580 --> 31:55.749
Yo, his name is Chet
and you know he's crunk

31:55.915 --> 31:57.876
He likes the girls that got the junk

31:58.043 --> 32:00.295
He's a paperboy
And he's making them bills

32:00.462 --> 32:02.672
He got these diamonds all up in his grills

32:02.839 --> 32:04.632
He makes the grades from day to day

32:04.799 --> 32:06.968
When he go to the club he don't gotta pay

32:07.135 --> 32:10.513
Hey, we're almost the only ones left to go.
We should get together.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.767
Soon, I promise, 'cause I really
have to work on the band now, you know?

32:13.933 --> 32:15.352
They have to sound fuller.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.980
They're Living on Cheap Trick covers.
It's embarrassing.

32:19.147 --> 32:21.149
You don't have to. You want to.

32:21.316 --> 32:25.612
You haven't heard them.
Believe me, I have to.

32:26.738 --> 32:29.032
You want to.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.492
Dear David Bowie,

32:30.658 --> 32:32.452
first thing we need is a brass section.

32:32.619 --> 32:37.582
Though, granted, Van Buren
has a limited pool to choose from.

32:37.749 --> 32:41.920
The pianists around here are all classical.

32:50.762 --> 32:53.932
If Arcade Fire can have a cello,
we can have a cello.

32:54.099 --> 32:56.601
- Need a hand?
- Need a Stanford-Binet test?

32:56.768 --> 33:00.230
What? Sorry. It looked heavy.

33:01.064 --> 33:03.983
I have eight weeks
to turn them into an actual band.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.404
We need to take all this
psychotic energy and talent

33:07.570 --> 33:09.447
and turn it into something new.

33:09.614 --> 33:14.411
Okay, look, let's just start
by playing something simple.

33:14.577 --> 33:18.248
You guys ever heard of blue beat?

33:18.915 --> 33:22.585
Basher, get behind your drum kit.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.630
Please?

33:31.052 --> 33:34.472
All right, now, give me a Sly and Robbie
kind of groove, you know?

33:34.639 --> 33:36.182
- Something 2 Tone.
- I don't do blue beat.

33:36.349 --> 33:38.685
Everybody knows
you could beat that kit senseless,

33:38.852 --> 33:41.521
but real power is in holding back.

33:41.688 --> 33:45.191
Control, you know, finding a groove.
Come on.

33:45.358 --> 33:48.153
Use some hi-hat.

33:49.946 --> 33:53.616
Okay, you know what a reggae groove is.
Cross stick.

33:53.783 --> 33:56.953
There we go. Kick drum.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.957
Sweet. No wonder you are a legend.

34:01.124 --> 34:04.294
All right, Bug, come on, come on.

34:04.461 --> 34:09.716
All right, listen to what he's doing
and try and play against it.

34:10.717 --> 34:13.636
Okay, that's good.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.806
There we go.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.978
That is what I'm talking about. That is what
you call a rhythm section. Everybody!

34:22.145 --> 34:24.438
Come on. Just make up your part.

34:24.606 --> 34:28.650
Don't worry about it being perfect, okay?

34:28.985 --> 34:32.989
Just make it fit to what you're hearing.

34:40.080 --> 34:44.333
And after the one,
let me hear some trombone.

34:47.587 --> 34:50.005
Trumpet.

34:56.971 --> 34:59.391
And sax.

35:05.814 --> 35:09.359
Will Burton, you are amazing...

35:10.110 --> 35:12.320
Mon.

35:14.114 --> 35:15.907
You guys are gonna sound great.

35:16.074 --> 35:18.576
But for Bandslam,
we need to find that one great song

35:18.743 --> 35:21.496
- that says who we really are.
- So what exactly are you looking for?

35:21.663 --> 35:23.415
I mean, I don't know,
but I will when I hear it.

35:23.581 --> 35:24.541
What else?

35:24.708 --> 35:27.002
All right, we have to talk
about the band name.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.295
I mean, there can't be two Glory Dogs.
There just can't.

35:29.462 --> 35:31.339
- Why? We are the Glory Dogs!
- We are the Glory Dogs. Yeah?

35:31.506 --> 35:33.133
Honestly, the name just sucks.

35:33.299 --> 35:37.554
It's lame and generic
and sounds like a Springsteen cover band.

35:37.721 --> 35:41.725
Okay, well, what do you want to call us?

35:42.100 --> 35:44.602
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

35:44.769 --> 35:45.687
I Can't a What a What?

35:45.854 --> 35:49.441
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.
It's evocative. It's memorable.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.776
It's ridiculous!
And it's not a name, all right?

35:51.943 --> 35:53.611
Don't say that!
- Glory Dogs, it says we're scruffy,

35:53.778 --> 35:55.989
- you know? We bite.
- You know, it is a name.

35:56.156 --> 35:58.742
Like Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly,

35:58.908 --> 36:02.037
or Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,
which are both great bands.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.873
This is where I draw the line.
I am not giving Ben Glory Dogs!

36:05.040 --> 36:06.499
Get your ego out of it!

36:06.666 --> 36:08.501
Will knows more about this stuff
in his little finger

36:08.668 --> 36:10.253
than the rest of us put together.

36:10.420 --> 36:14.466
You actually think we were better
before Will came along?

36:14.632 --> 36:18.303
Yeah, we were a joke.
Now we have a shot at being a band.

36:18.470 --> 36:21.264
Come on, to I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

36:21.431 --> 36:23.975
Fine. Fine.

36:38.323 --> 36:41.951
- How was your day?
Inappropriate! Inappropriate!

36:42.118 --> 36:44.037
- Honey, I was just...
- Taking a shower!

36:44.204 --> 36:46.664
Years from now, some shrink will pick out
this moment in time...

36:46.831 --> 36:50.085
Fine, fine, but hurry up.

36:59.636 --> 37:02.764
You're pulling away from me. A little bit.

37:02.931 --> 37:07.268
And I don't know how I feel about it.
I just... I have to say that out loud.

37:07.435 --> 37:09.604
We are not having this discussion now.

37:09.771 --> 37:12.148
Can we continue this after rehearsal?

37:12.315 --> 37:14.651
Please?

37:34.754 --> 37:38.675
On the seventh hour of the seventh day

37:40.719 --> 37:45.473
The seventh son was looking
for a seventh-stage getaway

37:45.932 --> 37:49.936
The word came down from a blinding light

37:51.771 --> 37:56.234
You got one chance, baby
Baby, you better do it right

37:56.401 --> 38:00.155
Well, I was driving down on the 101

38:02.699 --> 38:07.454
And it was late at night and I was thinking
about the things I'd done

38:07.620 --> 38:09.998
All of my regrets

38:10.165 --> 38:13.418
And baby, all of my fears

38:13.752 --> 38:18.465
Yeah, I was slipping the car
From gear to gear to gear

38:18.631 --> 38:21.301
Hey, hey, hey

38:29.768 --> 38:32.354
Godbless the child

38:32.520 --> 38:35.357
Godbless his soul

38:35.857 --> 38:40.362
God perish the idea
that he'll die before he's old

38:40.820 --> 38:43.073
You gotta be cool

38:43.239 --> 38:46.076
You got to behave

38:46.910 --> 38:51.289
Man, there'll be a time for that
when I'm lying in my grave

38:51.456 --> 38:55.919
You gotta watch your step
or you'll lose your way

38:57.754 --> 39:02.258
Take heed of the others
and do everything they say

39:02.592 --> 39:05.428
Watch out for the man

39:05.595 --> 39:08.556
Who never tolls the bells

39:08.723 --> 39:11.434
'Cause if I fear for the devil
and I fear for myself

39:11.601 --> 39:15.897
Then I'm gonna have to fear
for everybody else

39:16.690 --> 39:19.359
I'm gonna fly

39:19.526 --> 39:21.695
And I'm gonna live

39:21.861 --> 39:24.489
Until the day I die

39:24.656 --> 39:27.367
And I ain't got time

39:27.534 --> 39:30.203
To wonder why

39:30.620 --> 39:32.497
I'm gonna live

39:32.664 --> 39:35.583
Till the day I die

40:32.057 --> 40:34.809
We still have that stupid
Human Studies project to finish,

40:34.976 --> 40:38.897
and we haven't hung out
since you've become Joe Cool Rock 'n' Roll.

40:39.064 --> 40:40.774
You still haven't taken me
to your favorite place.

40:40.940 --> 40:46.196
- 'Cause I've never been there.
- How can it be your favorite place, then?

40:46.363 --> 40:48.615
What?

41:05.131 --> 41:07.384
Will.

41:09.678 --> 41:11.388
What now? Huh?

41:11.554 --> 41:13.973
Got you.

41:17.519 --> 41:19.854
Oh, no.

41:45.630 --> 41:48.800
- Check it out.
- Cool.

42:38.099 --> 42:40.101
CBGB's.

42:40.268 --> 42:45.523
The nerve center of everything that mattered
in music in the past 40 years,

42:45.690 --> 42:49.569
and it closed
before I ever got to step inside.

42:49.736 --> 42:54.407
Now they're turning it
into some cheesy clothing store.

42:54.574 --> 42:59.287
It's better that way.
Now it can never disappoint you.

43:05.585 --> 43:08.546
What are you doing?

43:17.222 --> 43:19.641
Come on.

43:47.877 --> 43:51.589
- Look at it.
- Yeah, it's a toilet.

43:51.756 --> 43:54.050
Are you kidding me?

43:54.217 --> 43:57.178
Birthplace of punk!

43:58.430 --> 44:01.016
The Ramones.

44:02.559 --> 44:04.894
Patti Smith.

44:05.061 --> 44:09.649
Do you know how many times
she must've spit on this floor?

44:09.816 --> 44:11.443
Bad Brains.

44:11.609 --> 44:15.572
Without CBGB's,
there'd be no Sex Pistols or The Clash.

44:15.739 --> 44:19.159
So U2 doesn't get inspired
to form a band in Ireland.

44:19.325 --> 44:23.788
And the Killers don't hear U2 in Vegas
and decide to pick up guitars.

44:23.955 --> 44:26.958
The list is endless!

44:27.208 --> 44:31.713
Wow. I'm starting to feel
like a Japanese tourist.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.763
Then the rent got jacked, like, 2,000%.

44:40.472 --> 44:46.311
So now CBGB's is just a T-shirt
Paris Hilton wears if she wants to look cool.

44:50.857 --> 44:54.527
I knew it'd be my favorite place.

44:54.986 --> 44:57.822
So, what's yours?

44:58.865 --> 45:01.451
Now this is.

45:22.972 --> 45:24.015
It's all right. You lived.

45:24.182 --> 45:27.519
I think if you tried signaling,
people would honk less.

45:27.686 --> 45:32.023
- They don't need to know my business.
- It's not really a privacy issue.

45:32.190 --> 45:34.776
Pretty good rehearsal today,
don't you think?

45:34.943 --> 45:37.654
So, what's up with you and Sa5m?

45:37.821 --> 45:39.823
- You like her.
- She's my friend.

45:39.989 --> 45:42.742
- No, you "like her" like her.
- Shut up.

45:42.909 --> 45:45.745
- Have you kissed her yet?
- No.

45:45.912 --> 45:47.038
Have you ever kissed any girl?

45:47.205 --> 45:50.000
Remember how I said that "eating
your laundry for a month" conversation

45:50.166 --> 45:54.337
was my least favorite memory?
We have a new champion.

45:54.504 --> 45:56.506
You gotta go for her. Carpe diem.

45:56.673 --> 45:59.134
You're crazy. She'd laugh at me.

45:59.300 --> 46:02.053
Trust me, that girl is one kiss away
from doodling "Mrs. Will Burton"

46:02.220 --> 46:05.306
all over her sneakers.

46:06.641 --> 46:10.228
I wouldn't even know what to do.

46:13.231 --> 46:18.987
Okay. I only do this for people with dazzling
artistic ability and whose initials are W. B.

46:19.154 --> 46:20.405
Come here.

46:20.572 --> 46:23.491
Don't have an aneurysm.
This is strictly educational.

46:23.658 --> 46:27.579
Commit everything I do and say to memory.
How you handle this moment with Sa5m

46:27.746 --> 46:32.500
will haunt you, good or bad,
for the rest of your life.

46:33.293 --> 46:34.878
All right.

46:35.045 --> 46:40.091
First, start by gently moving
a strand of hair from her face.

46:40.258 --> 46:42.719
Go ahead.

46:45.638 --> 46:50.101
Allows you to touch her
without freaking her out.

46:50.810 --> 46:51.936
Nice.

46:52.103 --> 46:57.400
Now that your hand is there,
turn it into a caress down her cheek.

47:00.487 --> 47:04.908
Once you've made physical contact,
never cede your ground.

47:05.075 --> 47:06.951
It's very important.

47:07.118 --> 47:11.373
Now, lower your hand
to the back of her neck.

47:13.875 --> 47:17.337
Then lean in. Slowly. Slowly.

47:18.338 --> 47:20.757
Breathe.

47:21.132 --> 47:24.844
Slight parting of the lips, and...

47:40.360 --> 47:45.115
I bet you'll never forget that song
for the rest of your life.

47:45.281 --> 47:47.867
Night, Will.

48:01.506 --> 48:04.592
Good night, Charlotte.

48:05.969 --> 48:09.180
I am so going to heaven.

48:23.737 --> 48:26.448
Hello, Mother.

48:44.049 --> 48:47.093
- Morning.
- Morning.

48:52.349 --> 48:57.145
You busy after school?
Have you ever been to the Overlook?

48:57.312 --> 49:00.315
What's the Overlook?

49:01.274 --> 49:03.526
What?

49:11.034 --> 49:15.747
Dear David Bowie,
I wouldn't tell anyone this but you.

49:19.042 --> 49:21.503
Boy, you sure like to read, huh?

49:21.670 --> 49:25.298
My shrink says it allows me
to control something in my life.

49:25.465 --> 49:27.926
This was it,
the moment that would haunt me,

49:28.093 --> 49:32.430
for better or worse,
for the entire rest of my life.

49:32.597 --> 49:36.017
Start with a strand of hair.

49:38.103 --> 49:41.106
She's wearing a hat!

49:44.901 --> 49:48.405
- What are you doing?
- You...

49:53.952 --> 49:57.038
What was next? Caress!

50:01.126 --> 50:05.964
This was not a caress.
This was petting. I'm petting her.

50:11.177 --> 50:14.472
Okay, enough. This was it.

51:03.938 --> 51:07.275
Have you seen Evil Dead II?

51:09.319 --> 51:11.446
No.

51:11.613 --> 51:14.157
It's my favorite movie ever.

51:14.324 --> 51:15.867
You never get to see it in a theatre,

51:16.034 --> 51:18.870
but it's playing at the college
Saturday night.

51:19.037 --> 51:23.583
They don't card anyone there.
Would you want to go?

51:23.833 --> 51:26.753
Sure. I'd love to.

51:27.879 --> 51:30.131
Cool.

51:31.383 --> 51:37.097
All in all, I think it went pretty well.
Your number-one fan, Will Burton.

51:51.986 --> 51:57.283
But it's fun, it's fun.
You know, I've been in a few bands, and...

51:59.911 --> 52:02.330
Boy, you tied the heck
out of that shoe.

52:02.497 --> 52:03.873
Considering it was already tied
and everything.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.293
- Can't be too careful.
- You don't have an inhaler, do you?

52:07.460 --> 52:09.629
'Cause if you do,
you might want to get it ready.

52:09.796 --> 52:11.172
- No!
- Yeah.

52:11.339 --> 52:12.841
You're getting a sneak peek
at the competition,

52:13.008 --> 52:14.426
and I'm not talking Glory Dogs.

52:14.592 --> 52:16.970
Burning Hotels?
But I didn't think there was any way that...

52:17.137 --> 52:20.306
Where there's a will...

52:22.600 --> 52:24.978
Dear David Bowie,
I know it's not saying much,

52:25.145 --> 52:29.899
but this is the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

52:37.365 --> 52:39.784
I got in, you got out

52:39.951 --> 52:42.537
I walked in, you walked out

52:42.704 --> 52:46.291
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

52:48.335 --> 52:50.920
I'm closer to closure

52:51.087 --> 52:53.715
Admitting that it's over

52:53.882 --> 52:57.469
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

52:59.012 --> 53:01.681
And now you know

53:01.848 --> 53:04.934
That you control everything

53:05.101 --> 53:08.688
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

53:09.773 --> 53:11.941
And now I'm drowning

53:12.108 --> 53:12.984
Where's Will?

53:13.151 --> 53:15.612
In myself again

53:15.779 --> 53:18.198
Yes, I'm drowning

53:18.365 --> 53:21.117
In myself again

53:46.101 --> 53:48.812
White at night

53:50.730 --> 53:53.191
I am dead

53:58.405 --> 54:01.116
White at night

54:03.034 --> 54:05.495
I am dead

54:10.291 --> 54:13.503
Who knows how I got out?

54:15.505 --> 54:19.092
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

54:38.236 --> 54:41.614
I am such a jerk. But it was Burning Hotels!

54:41.781 --> 54:45.577
I had to see the competition.
Don't I get a Burning Hotels pardon?

54:45.744 --> 54:48.038
Tell me one thing.

54:48.204 --> 54:51.624
- Were you with her?
- Yeah.

54:53.960 --> 54:56.046
Are you in love with Charlotte?

54:56.212 --> 54:57.756
What?

54:57.922 --> 54:59.716
- You are.
- I'm not.

54:59.883 --> 55:04.054
- I'm not.
- You had a thing. I don't care.

55:06.389 --> 55:11.519
Look, just remember.
She's trouble. Girls like that always are.

55:11.895 --> 55:15.607
That's ridiculous.
I'm not in love with Charlotte.

55:15.774 --> 55:21.571
You still haven't washed your hand yet.
It was that special, being with her.

55:37.128 --> 55:38.046
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

55:38.213 --> 55:40.298
Sa5m should be home any minute.

55:40.465 --> 55:42.801
What is this project
that you're working on about?

55:42.967 --> 55:48.098
Each other. We're supposed to show
the class who the other person really is.

55:48.264 --> 55:50.517
Yeah.

55:57.565 --> 56:00.860
You sheltered me from harm

56:01.778 --> 56:04.364
Kept me warm

56:05.031 --> 56:07.617
Kept me warm

56:10.203 --> 56:13.289
You gave my life to me

56:14.499 --> 56:17.043
Set me free

56:18.294 --> 56:22.132
It was a competition. She didn't win.

56:23.383 --> 56:26.636
Yeah. Judges were idiots.

56:27.303 --> 56:28.638
Morons.

56:28.805 --> 56:32.225
All the years I had with you

56:32.517 --> 56:36.187
And I would give everything I own

56:39.024 --> 56:42.944
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home

56:45.363 --> 56:48.825
I would give everything I own

56:51.703 --> 56:53.580
What are you doing?

56:53.747 --> 56:56.374
- Here we go.
- What's wrong? That was amazing.

56:56.541 --> 56:59.377
- I can't believe you showed that to him.
- Why not? What's the big deal?

56:59.544 --> 57:01.212
Why are you here?

57:01.379 --> 57:05.342
- I came to apologize again.
- Just go.

57:08.219 --> 57:10.930
She'll forgive you.
I happen to be a girl. I know these things.

57:11.097 --> 57:13.641
Yeah. Okay.

57:16.227 --> 57:20.023
Hey, we got our first post.
"Lower your mortgage rates now. "

57:20.190 --> 57:22.984
Does spam count?

57:32.744 --> 57:35.080
You weren't reading my IM, were you?

57:35.246 --> 57:36.706
You mean the one from Phil
that said "love you"?

57:36.873 --> 57:37.749
- Yeah.
- No.

57:37.916 --> 57:40.168
Good.

57:41.836 --> 57:43.755
He's my dad.

57:43.922 --> 57:48.093
- And you call him Phil?
- That's his name.

57:54.641 --> 57:57.811
Hi. I've been looking for you.

57:57.977 --> 58:00.939
Well, you found me.

58:08.238 --> 58:13.326
I went back up to Hunter Mountain again.
Got stuck on the exact same lift as last year.

58:13.493 --> 58:15.578
No way.
Seriously.

58:15.745 --> 58:19.082
It seems it's not as magical
when you're by yourself.

58:19.249 --> 58:20.709
What'd you do?

58:20.875 --> 58:25.630
Same thing I did last year.
I cried like a little girl.

58:27.007 --> 58:28.633
Listen, Charlotte.

58:28.800 --> 58:31.928
I was thinking that maybe it's time for you
to give me another chance.

58:32.095 --> 58:34.431
Look...

58:36.516 --> 58:41.354
- What's this?
- This is me risking complete humiliation.

58:49.446 --> 58:52.407
Say, won't you stay

58:53.283 --> 58:55.160
We can talk about nothing at all

58:55.326 --> 58:58.163
You are so corny.

58:58.997 --> 59:02.042
Or sit here and make up the words

59:02.208 --> 59:04.919
As we go along

59:06.713 --> 59:09.507
They told me maybe she's crazy

59:09.674 --> 59:12.010
A little like you

59:12.177 --> 59:16.014
Everyone said you were nothing but trouble

59:16.181 --> 59:20.935
And all that I know
is that I've never been here before

59:22.479 --> 59:26.024
I don't need to pretend anymore

59:33.823 --> 59:36.326
Strange, so strange

59:36.493 --> 59:37.660
You are hilarious.

59:37.827 --> 59:41.414
When it feels better being alone

59:41.998 --> 59:45.585
You'll accept there is nobody else

59:45.752 --> 59:48.755
Then set it in stone

59:50.256 --> 59:53.218
And they told me maybe she's crazy

59:53.385 --> 59:56.096
A little like you

59:56.262 --> 59:59.057
Everyone said...

01:00:03.853 --> 01:00:08.566
Will and I were just updating our band's
MySpace page.

01:00:16.449 --> 01:00:19.703
You know that kid, Will Burton?
Do some recon.

01:00:19.869 --> 01:00:20.787
Find out everything you can about him.

01:00:20.954 --> 01:00:24.165
They'll have his records in the office.
Where he's from, where he went to school.

01:00:24.332 --> 01:00:27.252
His guidance counsellor report,
that'll have all the good stuff. All right?

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:28.920
Everything. And do it today.

01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:31.881
Whoa. Yo, dude,
we don't actually work for you.

01:00:32.048 --> 01:00:36.803
It's not like you're the Joker
and we're your henchmen.

01:00:37.512 --> 01:00:40.640
Fine. I'll do it myself.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.520
All right, best for last. Sa5m, Will?
Tell us who you are.

01:00:54.279 --> 01:00:57.574
My project is Will Burton.

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:02.996
I'm pointing
because it's hard to tell who he is.

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:07.125
I was going to use photographs
for this presentation,

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:12.672
but then I realized, the real Will Burton
can't be captured on film.

01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:16.384
Instead,

01:01:16.926 --> 01:01:19.512
you need this.

01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:23.058
Will is a reflective surface.

01:01:23.224 --> 01:01:27.604
He mirrors back at you
whatever you want to see.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:30.815
He reflects you back to you.

01:01:30.982 --> 01:01:34.110
And it's nice for awhile.

01:01:34.277 --> 01:01:36.988
You stop feeling lonely.

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:41.743
But then you realize,
he's doing that with everyone.

01:01:44.287 --> 01:01:47.999
The only person he can't do it for

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:49.876
is Will.

01:01:50.043 --> 01:01:53.088
Because he doesn't have a clue

01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:55.757
who he is.

01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:09.312
Okay, well, that was very creative.

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:13.441
And really mean. Okay, Will, you're up.

01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:13.418
If I told you things I did before

01:03:13.585 --> 01:03:16.838
Told you how I used to be

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:21.009
Would you go along with someone like me?

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:27.390
If you knew my story word for word

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:30.602
Had all of my history

01:03:30.977 --> 01:03:34.981
Would you go along with someone like me?

01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:40.362
And we don't care about the young folks

01:03:40.528 --> 01:03:43.365
Talking about the young style

01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:46.493
And we don't care about the old folks

01:03:46.659 --> 01:03:50.205
Talking about the old style too

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:54.250
And we don't care about our own faults

01:03:54.417 --> 01:03:57.295
Talking about our own style

01:03:57.462 --> 01:04:00.090
All we care about is talking

01:04:00.256 --> 01:04:03.426
Talking only me and you

01:04:04.427 --> 01:04:08.098
And we don't care about the young folks

01:04:08.264 --> 01:04:11.226
Talking about the young style

01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:14.229
And we don't care about the old folks

01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:17.941
Talking about the old style too

01:04:18.316 --> 01:04:21.820
And we don't care about our own faults

01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:24.906
Talking about our own style

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:28.118
All we care about is talking

01:04:28.284 --> 01:04:31.454
Talking only me and you

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:34.958
Talking only me and you

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:43.883
Dear David Bowie,

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:48.513
sometimes it seems like things
actually work out.

01:04:53.351 --> 01:04:58.982
English, Irene. English. There is
no such thing as conversational Elvish.

01:05:00.358 --> 01:05:03.028
Sorry, Dewey.

01:05:05.363 --> 01:05:07.574
It's what they call you, isn't it?

01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:08.950
No.

01:05:09.117 --> 01:05:12.120
It was at your last school.
Or do you prefer "Junior"?

01:05:12.287 --> 01:05:14.748
Do you know your buddy,
his full name is Will Burton, Jr.?

01:05:14.914 --> 01:05:16.291
Did you know that I don't care?

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:18.126
Well, he told you
his dad was famous, right?

01:05:18.293 --> 01:05:21.087
Or infamous, right, Dewey?
I mean, you still close to the old man?

01:05:21.254 --> 01:05:22.881
You probably don't get to talk to him
much anymore, do you?

01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:26.801
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, I think you do, Dewey.

01:05:26.968 --> 01:05:30.055
I think you do, Dewey.

01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:40.315
Okay, that was surreal. Are you okay?

01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:43.985
I don't... I got... I gotta...

01:05:53.828 --> 01:05:55.872
What are you doing?

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:59.459
You didn't answer my texts,
and you left me alone with the monsters.

01:05:59.626 --> 01:06:01.628
Sorry, I'm sick.

01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:05.715
My spidey-sense tells me you're lying.

01:06:06.383 --> 01:06:08.593
I'm thinking about changing schools.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.013
No way, my little friend. I'm not facing
the Neanderthals without you.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:17.519
Besides, if you change schools,
then you can't gain access to this.

01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:21.189
- What's that?
- Something private.

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:24.901
Something I would only show
the manager of my band.

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.862
Or my best friend.

01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:30.365
Scooch.

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:34.869
Okay. You said we needed one song
that says who we are.

01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:38.289
Well, these say who I am.

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:43.378
Little brothers.

01:06:44.004 --> 01:06:47.090
Little brothers again.

01:06:48.758 --> 01:06:50.677
- For your dad?
- No.

01:06:50.844 --> 01:06:53.263
Not for him, exactly.

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:55.598
Inspired by him, I guess.
You know, things he said to me.

01:06:55.765 --> 01:06:59.185
But it's not just about my dad anymore.
That'd be, hello, weird.

01:06:59.352 --> 01:07:02.230
It's about everything.

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:04.566
Wow, that's articulate.

01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:05.900
You know, there's other stuff in here, too.

01:07:06.067 --> 01:07:09.404
- I'm not saying any of it's good...
- Thanks.

01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:15.285
Hey. By accepting this, it means that there
will be no more talk of changing schools.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:17.787
Agreed?

01:07:19.539 --> 01:07:22.167
- Man, I'm good.
- Charlotte!

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:24.878
- Charlotte! My mom is in the...
- I knew you were ticklish.

01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:28.590
You are so ticklish, I knew it.

01:07:29.299 --> 01:07:33.636
Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on in here?

01:07:35.555 --> 01:07:37.432
Get off his bed.

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:40.727
Wait. You don't think...

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:43.271
I saw you kiss him in the car.

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:45.482
Well, that was
for educational purposes only.

01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:46.608
I wanna die.

01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:49.152
Did you hear that? He wants to die.
He needs help, Karen.

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:51.363
Then I'll help him. I'm his mom.

01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:53.531
But I am wise in the ways of Will.

01:07:53.698 --> 01:07:58.161
I'm actually here, you know. These covers
don't literally make me disappear.

01:07:58.328 --> 01:08:00.747
You know what I think?
I think you're full of it, Charlotte.

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:03.249
And when I think someone's full of it,
I don't trust them.

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.335
Mom, will you stop interfering?

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:08.296
Sorry, I'm not your friend,
I'm your mother. That's my job.

01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:12.759
No, Mom, you're supposed to give me
a little breathing room so I can have a life,

01:08:12.926 --> 01:08:15.220
instead of just saying that's what you want.

01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:18.055
- He's got a point, Karen.
- And you, I'm not a manager.

01:08:18.223 --> 01:08:23.770
I don't take on the biggest band
in school and change destiny. I can't.

01:08:23.978 --> 01:08:28.024
Will you both just please leave me alone?

01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:34.113
Get out.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.377
- Somebody called me Dewey today.
- What? How?

01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:51.589
- He must've found out about Dad.
- I hate them all.

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:53.966
- Me too.
- You, however, I love.

01:08:54.134 --> 01:08:58.430
Yeah, but you married Dad.
We can't really trust your taste.

01:08:58.595 --> 01:09:02.142
I was 19. And he was a drummer.

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:05.687
And overnight it made my mother
finally take me seriously,

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:07.229
which is really all I wanted.

01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:08.356
- Mom?
- I... What?

01:09:08.523 --> 01:09:11.568
You're doing that thing
where you talk to me like I'm Oprah.

01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:17.115
I'll tell you this, though.
I'd marry him all over again to get you.

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:25.415
I promise you're going to get
everything you deserve out of life.

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:29.336
And a little bit of the next guy's.

01:09:38.928 --> 01:09:41.598
I'll never be

01:09:41.848 --> 01:09:45.769
A knight in armor with a sword in hand

01:09:47.187 --> 01:09:50.189
Ora kamikaze fighter

01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:54.109
Don't count on me

01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:58.281
To storm the barricades and take a stand

01:10:00.325 --> 01:10:03.161
Or hold my ground

01:10:04.329 --> 01:10:08.124
You'll never see any scars or wounds

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:12.087
I don't walk on coals

01:10:12.253 --> 01:10:15.298
I won't walk on water

01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:19.052
I am no prince

01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:21.971
I am no saint

01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:25.767
I am not anyone's wildest dream

01:10:27.894 --> 01:10:31.064
But I will stand behind

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.443
And be someone to fall back on

01:10:44.786 --> 01:10:47.580
That's the song.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.134
Some comedy

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.052
You're bruised and beaten down

01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:05.306
And I am the one who's looking for a favor

01:11:06.474 --> 01:11:08.768
Still, honestly

01:11:08.935 --> 01:11:12.564
You don't believe me
But the things I have

01:11:12.731 --> 01:11:15.900
Are the things you need

01:11:16.317 --> 01:11:20.113
You look at me like I don't make sense

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.576
Like a waste of time
Like it serves no purpose

01:11:25.785 --> 01:11:29.205
I am no prince
I am no saint

01:11:30.665 --> 01:11:34.627
And if that's what you believe you need

01:11:35.545 --> 01:11:38.882
You're wrong
You don't need much

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:42.635
You need someone to fall back on

01:11:45.055 --> 01:11:48.850
And I'll be that
I'll take your side

01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:52.729
If I'm the only one

01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:56.024
I'm used to that

01:11:57.067 --> 01:11:59.277
I've been alone

01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:02.113
I'd rather be

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:06.701
The half of us

01:12:06.868 --> 01:12:08.995
The least of you

01:12:09.162 --> 01:12:11.873
The best of me

01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:16.211
And I will be

01:12:16.378 --> 01:12:20.298
I'll be your prince
I'll be your saint

01:12:21.132 --> 01:12:25.428
I will go crashing through fences
in your name

01:12:27.138 --> 01:12:29.349
I will, I swear

01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:33.061
I'll be someone to fall back on

01:12:34.062 --> 01:12:37.315
I'll be the one who waits

01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:41.361
And for as long as you let me

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:45.115
I will be the one you need

01:12:46.491 --> 01:12:50.036
I'll be someone to fall back on

01:13:03.842 --> 01:13:07.012
Someone to fall back on

01:13:14.769 --> 01:13:17.731
One to fall back on

01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:31.786
Dear David Bowie,

01:13:32.912 --> 01:13:36.958
just when it looked like things
might be okay,

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:38.335
disaster struck.

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:41.087
What's going on? Where is everybody?

01:13:41.254 --> 01:13:45.884
- Art class is cancelled today.
- Why? What happened?

01:13:46.634 --> 01:13:50.180
Charlotte's father passed away.

01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:53.975
I assumed you knew.

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:56.311
No.

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:12.702
This was a mistake. We shouldn't be here.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:16.581
She didn't return any of my calls.

01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:20.418
- You going to be okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:22.837
Okay.

01:14:23.338 --> 01:14:27.175
Go, she's your friend. She needs you.

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:38.812
Boys...
- I got them.

01:14:48.738 --> 01:14:51.241
Charlotte?

01:14:53.243 --> 01:14:55.745
I'm sorry.

01:14:58.998 --> 01:15:00.333
I called.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.671
I don't know if you got any of my messages.

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:08.883
Yeah, I got them. Thanks.

01:15:10.176 --> 01:15:13.138
I wish you would've called me back.

01:15:13.304 --> 01:15:14.639
Why?

01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:16.141
"Why?"

01:15:16.307 --> 01:15:18.893
I don't know. I mean, you told Ben.

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.229
So?

01:15:21.813 --> 01:15:22.814
Is anything wrong?

01:15:22.981 --> 01:15:24.357
Yeah.

01:15:24.524 --> 01:15:25.650
Yeah, my dad died.

01:15:25.817 --> 01:15:27.277
No, I know.

01:15:27.444 --> 01:15:32.198
I wish I could've met him.
I'm sure he was a great man.

01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:35.827
He was.

01:15:37.287 --> 01:15:40.123
I got to do this.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.502
Charlotte.

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:49.674
- What do you want, Will?
- What do I want?

01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:51.593
I just want you to know that I'm here
for you.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.428
Okay, got it. What else?

01:15:53.595 --> 01:15:56.473
And not to worry about the daycare.
I can handle that until you come back.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:57.599
That's it.

01:15:57.766 --> 01:15:58.641
Listen, I'm sorry, okay.

01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:01.144
It's just a lot to deal with right now,
and I sort of want to be alone.

01:16:01.311 --> 01:16:02.437
Okay. I get it, yeah.

01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:03.646
And look, about the band...

01:16:03.813 --> 01:16:08.443
Don't even worry about the band, okay?
We'll use Phil's Song for Bandslam.

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:11.237
Or not. We don't have to use Phil's Song.
We can find another song, or...

01:16:11.404 --> 01:16:15.200
Hey, go ahead. Knock yourselves out.

01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:21.706
I mean, it's a beautiful song, Charlotte.

01:16:21.873 --> 01:16:24.167
It would make your dad proud.
It would be like he's there.

01:16:24.334 --> 01:16:27.212
Stop! Please, just stop!

01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:29.172
There is no us, Will. I'm not in the band.

01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:32.592
What? No, no, no.
Okay, we'll find another song...

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:35.553
It's not about the song. I quit. I just quit.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.013
- Why?
- I don't do "why"!

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.892
No, you have to. You just have to!

01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:49.609
Please.

01:16:55.699 --> 01:16:58.034
You really want to know why?

01:16:58.201 --> 01:17:01.913
Last summer, when my dad got sick,

01:17:02.914 --> 01:17:06.376
I promised God, the universe,

01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:10.755
anyone who'd listen,

01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:13.049
that I'd be different.

01:17:13.216 --> 01:17:15.927
Better. Nicer.

01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:21.433
My dad hated the way I acted
when I was with Ben.

01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:24.811
The way I treated kids who weren't popular.

01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:27.564
So, I changed.

01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:32.944
I started volunteering with the monsters.
I left my friends. I left my band.

01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:37.657
I left everything that set me apart
from people like...

01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:39.993
Me.

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:45.582
People like me.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.295
So we were just this

01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:53.256
experiment to try and make your dad okay?

01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:55.216
No, I know how crazy this must sound...

01:17:55.383 --> 01:17:58.303
Honestly, Charlotte,
the thing that never made sense

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:02.640
was you being my friend in the first place.

01:18:04.642 --> 01:18:07.896
Hey!
While you're up there on your high horse,

01:18:08.063 --> 01:18:11.399
ask yourself who are you
to judge me about lying?

01:18:11.566 --> 01:18:13.860
Dewey!

01:18:19.699 --> 01:18:21.951
That stands for DWI, right?

01:18:22.118 --> 01:18:25.413
Driving while intoxicated?

01:18:26.373 --> 01:18:29.668
I don't know what's worse.

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:36.091
Losing a father you love so much
you change your whole life for him,

01:18:39.427 --> 01:18:45.141
or having a father you're so ashamed of,
you make up a whole life for him.

01:19:20.176 --> 01:19:22.846
Can I have some beef jerky?

01:19:23.013 --> 01:19:25.724
Is he kidding?

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:31.021
You warned me about her.

01:19:31.187 --> 01:19:32.814
I didn't listen.

01:19:32.981 --> 01:19:37.861
She can't help it.
It's how girls like that are hardwired.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.365
How are we hardwired?

01:19:42.657 --> 01:19:46.703
I mean, sure, right now, I am just a kid.

01:19:47.746 --> 01:19:50.206
Whatever.

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:54.711
What's going to change?

01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:57.005
Nothing.

01:19:57.172 --> 01:19:59.716
I'm just going to be

01:19:59.883 --> 01:20:02.302
unhappy,

01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:05.722
alone,

01:20:05.889 --> 01:20:09.309
scared of, like, everything.

01:20:12.979 --> 01:20:16.149
You're not alone, Will.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:27.577
Experiment? We were just her experiment?

01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:29.537
I keep thinking...

01:20:29.704 --> 01:20:30.914
What?

01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:35.251
Well, if you were just part of
Charlotte's experiment this whole time,

01:20:35.418 --> 01:20:37.796
then, what is reality?

01:20:37.962 --> 01:20:39.881
What if Charlotte and her experiment are

01:20:40.048 --> 01:20:43.426
really a part of someone else's
larger experiment?

01:20:43.593 --> 01:20:48.264
I mean, what if we're being manipulated
by some greater intelligence than our own?

01:20:48.431 --> 01:20:53.061
And if so, is there really such a thing
as free will?

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.355
Am I moving my hand,

01:20:55.522 --> 01:20:59.609
or was it predetermined by a force
I'm not even aware of?

01:20:59.776 --> 01:21:03.113
Charlotte times a trillion.

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:14.040
See, this is why you don't have friends!

01:21:14.207 --> 01:21:17.502
All right, this is ridiculous! She doesn't
get to make our whole lives a lie!

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:22.215
I mean, it was real for me.
Wasn't it real for you?

01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:25.135
I say we refuse to let Charlotte
screw this up for us.

01:21:25.301 --> 01:21:28.805
I mean, we've worked too hard.

01:21:29.472 --> 01:21:31.599
We're doing Bandslam.

01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:32.809
You're crazy.
Why?

01:21:32.976 --> 01:21:35.353
How long have you got?

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.273
It won't work.
What song are we going to do?

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.858
Phil's Song. She said we could.

01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:43.862
Oh, yeah? And who's going to sing it?

01:22:29.407 --> 01:22:33.620
You say your patience is longer
than my face

01:22:35.246 --> 01:22:40.001
Oh, yeah, but I can see right through
your plastic case

01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:45.799
Oh, you're running round
like your life is some type of race

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:51.137
You know I'm trying
but I cannot keep your pace

01:22:51.596 --> 01:22:54.766
Oh, so take your blizzard
somewhere else, little girl

01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:58.186
Your stormy weather ain't welcome here

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:00.897
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

01:23:01.064 --> 01:23:04.317
Can't not buy it, buy it.

01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:10.281
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:13.952
How are the guys holding up?
Have you been backstage?

01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:17.163
Yeah, they're fine. Actually, they're great.

01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:20.542
Think I'll go and wish them luck.

01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:22.961
Okay.

01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:32.971
Hey! Dennis Ardmore.

01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:34.055
What?

01:23:34.222 --> 01:23:37.475
Dennis Ardmore.
Does that name ring a bell?

01:23:37.642 --> 01:23:39.394
No. Should it?

01:23:39.561 --> 01:23:43.940
I guess not. I just didn't know how much
research you all had done, so...

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:46.484
But he would've been about your age now.

01:23:46.651 --> 01:23:49.696
Except that Will's father got drunk in
the middle of the afternoon,

01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:51.406
like he did every afternoon,

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:56.327
and ran him over while he was walking
home from school.

01:23:56.703 --> 01:23:57.620
I heard. I'm sorry.

01:23:57.787 --> 01:24:01.833
Yeah. Did you hear that Will insisted
that I bring him to the funeral?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.918
That's what kind of kid he is.

01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:08.298
Twelve years old, he walks right up to
Dennis Ardmore's parents,

01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:11.885
and asked their forgiveness.

01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:19.768
Everyone hated Will's dad.

01:24:19.934 --> 01:24:22.187
Well, who wouldn't? I mean...

01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:26.941
And then they put him away, and it's
like they just turned it all on his kid.

01:24:27.108 --> 01:24:29.778
It was awful.

01:24:29.986 --> 01:24:31.237
So just give him a break.

01:24:31.404 --> 01:24:34.783
Please? Not a lot of people have.

01:24:34.949 --> 01:24:40.538
So I don't know what you were planning
on saying to him, or doing, but just don't.

01:24:40.705 --> 01:24:42.082
Just don't. Okay?

01:24:42.248 --> 01:24:46.461
Don't make up with him. Don't be his friend.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.879
Why not?

01:24:48.046 --> 01:24:53.051
Because, I don't think he'll recover
if you leave him twice.

01:24:55.345 --> 01:24:57.847
I've never met a kid like Will.

01:24:58.014 --> 01:24:59.933
My friends have never met a kid like Will.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.228
The monsters have never met a kid like Will.

01:25:03.395 --> 01:25:07.190
And I want you to let me apologize to him
because I want to keep knowing him.

01:25:07.357 --> 01:25:09.943
You know, I like who I am
when I'm with Will.

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:15.115
And I will do anything in the world
to be that person again.

01:25:17.325 --> 01:25:19.869
So, please,

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:24.833
don't ask me not to.

01:25:30.463 --> 01:25:32.507
Okay.

01:25:32.674 --> 01:25:35.176
Thank you.

01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:37.220
I said, "Okay. " I'm not going to hug you.

01:25:37.387 --> 01:25:39.055
Okay.

01:25:39.222 --> 01:25:41.516
And by the way,
I'm really glad you don't wear

01:25:41.683 --> 01:25:43.977
those little groupie outfits
all the time, Karen.

01:25:44.144 --> 01:25:46.980
You'll need this.

01:25:50.108 --> 01:25:51.985
All right.

01:25:52.152 --> 01:25:55.905
And I'm so sorry about your father.

01:26:14.215 --> 01:26:17.385
Tax and total it for me

01:26:21.389 --> 01:26:24.976
I'll pay my bill and run so fast

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.735
Separation is our love now

01:26:35.737 --> 01:26:38.239
Well, we're toast.

01:26:38.406 --> 01:26:41.618
I don't know. They're okay.

01:26:41.785 --> 01:26:42.911
I hear the band to watch

01:26:43.078 --> 01:26:48.333
is I Can't Drive Stick, I'll Drive Stick,
or something like that.

01:26:52.587 --> 01:26:55.757
Look, let me just speak.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:27:00.261
The whole experiment thing,
not my finest hour.

01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:05.767
I was angry and stupid
and really, really confused.

01:27:07.602 --> 01:27:10.313
And I'm sorry.

01:27:13.483 --> 01:27:15.110
Are you kidding me?

01:27:15.276 --> 01:27:16.820
Okay, quick recap.

01:27:16.986 --> 01:27:19.781
Charlotte dumps Ben,
turns you guys into a band,

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:22.117
finds the genius that is Will,

01:27:22.283 --> 01:27:25.620
then, does one stupid thing

01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:27.789
because her father has died,

01:27:27.956 --> 01:27:31.626
realizes, and comes to apologize.

01:27:32.293 --> 01:27:36.464
And you're not going to
accept the apology?

01:27:36.965 --> 01:27:40.427
Plus, I really miss you guys.

01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:45.223
Is that real?

01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:47.684
Hundred percent.

01:27:47.851 --> 01:27:53.732
The only thing that matters is seeing
you guys kick some serious butt tonight.

01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:57.068
And you're singing Phil's Song.

01:27:57.235 --> 01:28:00.947
- Is that okay?
- Yeah. Of course.

01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:06.703
And I'll be the girl in front,
screaming my head off while you do.

01:28:18.965 --> 01:28:21.092
Keep it hot like steam, that's your dream

01:28:21.259 --> 01:28:23.011
Baby, get up off me

01:28:23.178 --> 01:28:26.514
It's so clean, the way I've been
Gots me looking glossy

01:28:26.681 --> 01:28:29.893
On the scene with the queen
That be acting bossy

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.147
I don't want no drama, little mama
So please get up off me

01:28:34.314 --> 01:28:37.525
Yeah, you know how I blow
Till you're feeling dizzy

01:28:37.692 --> 01:28:41.154
Lots of soul, that's the goal

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.115
Yeah, go ahead. Copy that.

01:28:44.282 --> 01:28:46.159
Way to be impartial.

01:28:46.326 --> 01:28:49.371
Way to be realistic about your chances.

01:28:49.537 --> 01:28:51.664
Way to say "way" just because I did.

01:28:51.831 --> 01:28:55.085
Yeah. Standing by. Follow spots.

01:28:55.251 --> 01:28:59.881
And now, from Martin Van Buren
High School in Lodi, New Jersey,

01:29:00.048 --> 01:29:03.593
Ben Wheatly and the Glory Dogs!

01:29:06.638 --> 01:29:09.557
You're number one!

01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:15.855
Thank you.

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:21.569
Thank you so much.

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:27.367
I'd like to dedicate this next song
to someone very special to me.

01:29:28.451 --> 01:29:30.203
She taught me a lot,

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:32.914
and she wrote this song.

01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:36.793
So, Charlotte, this one's for you.

01:29:40.755 --> 01:29:42.966
I'll never be

01:29:43.133 --> 01:29:47.053
A knight in armor with a sword in hand

01:29:47.303 --> 01:29:50.390
Whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

01:29:50.557 --> 01:29:52.600
Don't count on me

01:29:52.767 --> 01:29:56.354
To storm the barricades and take a stand

01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:58.773
I didn't know. I swear. I didn't know.

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.275
- No, no, no.
- What?

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:02.527
You'll never see

01:30:02.694 --> 01:30:06.448
It's old. Ben knew it. He probably thought
he was doing something nice for me.

01:30:06.614 --> 01:30:09.325
I had no idea, Karen.
You've got to believe me!

01:30:09.492 --> 01:30:11.244
I am no prince

01:30:11.411 --> 01:30:12.996
I am no saint

01:30:13.163 --> 01:30:16.166
I am not anyone's wildest dream

01:30:16.332 --> 01:30:18.835
What are we going to do?
We can't sing the same song.

01:30:19.002 --> 01:30:21.880
I don't know anything else.

01:30:22.047 --> 01:30:23.048
Yes, you do.

01:30:23.214 --> 01:30:26.426
And it's famous and only has, like,
four chords.

01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:27.927
Alley. Now!

01:30:28.094 --> 01:30:31.264
Someone to fall back on

01:30:50.784 --> 01:30:53.953
Someone to fall back on

01:31:13.431 --> 01:31:14.683
Come on!

01:31:14.849 --> 01:31:15.892
We need another minute.

01:31:16.059 --> 01:31:17.143
We don't have another minute! They just...

01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:20.480
We need another minute!

01:31:25.777 --> 01:31:29.489
Our last band is also from
Martin Van Buren High.

01:31:29.656 --> 01:31:31.950
I don't know what they're putting
in the water in Lodi,

01:31:32.117 --> 01:31:36.371
but give it up for I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:43.211
That's us! Come on!

01:31:43.378 --> 01:31:44.629
What's going on?

01:31:44.796 --> 01:31:46.423
Get on stage.

01:31:46.589 --> 01:31:48.883
- Where?
- On stage!

01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:51.761
- Why? No! What am I going to do?
- You're going to stall!

01:31:51.928 --> 01:31:54.973
- They hate me.
- Go!

01:32:12.073 --> 01:32:16.327
Say something, for God's sake,
say something.

01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:22.125
Dewey!

01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:26.379
Dewey!

01:32:26.546 --> 01:32:29.090
Oh, my God!

01:32:29.799 --> 01:32:32.093
Dewey!

01:32:32.802 --> 01:32:34.679
Where's the band?

01:32:34.846 --> 01:32:36.139
Dewey!

01:32:36.306 --> 01:32:37.432
Dewey.

01:32:37.599 --> 01:32:39.893
Dewey!

01:32:41.061 --> 01:32:43.355
Dewey!

01:32:51.196 --> 01:32:54.199
Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!

01:33:36.157 --> 01:33:39.160
Dewey. Dewey. Dewey.

01:33:45.375 --> 01:33:47.669
Dewey. Come on! Dewey.

01:33:47.836 --> 01:33:50.839
Dewey. Dewey. Dewey.

01:33:51.631 --> 01:33:53.341
Dewey... Yeah, come on!

01:33:53.508 --> 01:33:56.302
Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!

01:33:56.469 --> 01:33:59.431
Do we want to rock?

01:34:02.851 --> 01:34:04.728
Wake up, New Jersey!

01:34:04.894 --> 01:34:08.231
I said, do we want to rock?

01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:19.492
Because I have seen the future

01:34:19.659 --> 01:34:21.161
and their name is,

01:34:21.327 --> 01:34:24.622
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

01:35:18.677 --> 01:35:21.638
You shelter me from harm

01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:24.057
You kept me warm

01:35:24.224 --> 01:35:26.810
Kept me warm

01:35:27.936 --> 01:35:30.897
You gave my life to me

01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:33.608
Set me free

01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:40.073
The finest years I ever knew

01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:43.785
All the years I had with you

01:35:43.952 --> 01:35:47.622
And I would give everything I own

01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:48.790
One time

01:35:48.957 --> 01:35:52.335
Give up my life, my heart, my home

01:35:52.502 --> 01:35:53.420
Two times

01:35:53.586 --> 01:35:57.048
I would give everything I own

01:35:58.466 --> 01:36:01.803
Just to have you once again

01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:17.861
You taught me how to love

01:36:18.028 --> 01:36:20.613
What it's of

01:36:23.366 --> 01:36:27.078
You never said too much
But still you showed the way

01:36:27.245 --> 01:36:30.665
And I knew from watching you

01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:36.004
Nobody else could ever know

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.758
The part of me that can't let go

01:36:39.924 --> 01:36:43.595
And I would give everything I own

01:36:44.721 --> 01:36:48.433
Give up my life, my heart, my home

01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.562
I would give everything I own

01:36:54.522 --> 01:36:57.859
Just to have you once again

01:36:58.985 --> 01:37:02.322
Just to have you once again

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.495
Is there someone you know

01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:10.872
You're loving them so

01:37:11.039 --> 01:37:14.584
But taking them all for granted

01:37:15.877 --> 01:37:17.879
You may lose them one day

01:37:18.046 --> 01:37:20.465
Someone takes them away

01:37:20.632 --> 01:37:24.886
And they don't hear the words
you long to say

01:37:28.181 --> 01:37:31.643
I would give everything I own

01:37:32.686 --> 01:37:36.398
Give up my life, my heart, my home

01:37:37.524 --> 01:37:40.860
I would give anything I own

01:37:42.445 --> 01:37:45.240
Just to have you

01:37:45.532 --> 01:37:47.575
I gotta have you

01:37:47.742 --> 01:37:50.495
I would give everything I own

01:37:50.662 --> 01:37:52.163
Everything I own

01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:55.333
Give up my life, my heart, my home

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.962
I would give everything I own

01:37:59.337 --> 01:38:01.756
Everything, everything I own

01:38:01.923 --> 01:38:04.968
- Just to have you
- Just to have you

01:38:05.135 --> 01:38:08.596
I would give everything I own

01:38:09.597 --> 01:38:13.309
Give up my life, my heart, my home

01:38:14.144 --> 01:38:17.605
I would give everything I own

01:38:18.732 --> 01:38:22.444
Give up my life, my heart, my home

01:38:23.236 --> 01:38:25.822
I would give

01:38:49.179 --> 01:38:52.849
Everything, everything I own
Everything, everything I own

01:38:53.016 --> 01:38:57.645
Everything, everything I own
Everything, everything I

01:39:04.861 --> 01:39:07.030
Own

01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:13.138
Dude! That was sick!

01:40:14.514 --> 01:40:17.976
The whole thing with Ben singing
the song, I swear, I didn't know.

01:40:18.143 --> 01:40:19.644
I know. I know.

01:40:19.811 --> 01:40:22.814
That... They were ridiculously good!

01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:24.899
Who are you? You are...

01:40:25.066 --> 01:40:27.569
- Mom.
- Where do you come from?

01:40:27.736 --> 01:40:32.532
Cute lead singer I hope to make
my girlfriend is actually laughing at me.

01:40:32.699 --> 01:40:35.493
All right. Fine.

01:40:42.334 --> 01:40:45.295
It's time to leave.

01:40:54.304 --> 01:40:58.516
And the winner of this year's Bandslam is...

01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:16.868
From Greenwich High School in
Greenwich, Connecticut, The Daze!

01:41:40.433 --> 01:41:41.309
Over here, please.

01:41:41.476 --> 01:41:43.019
Can we get a smiley one right here?

01:41:43.186 --> 01:41:46.106
One more.
$10,000.

01:41:47.357 --> 01:41:50.110
The part of me that can't let go

01:41:50.276 --> 01:41:53.488
Forget The Daze,
these guys rocked harder than anybody.

01:41:53.655 --> 01:41:54.948
You should post it.

01:41:55.115 --> 01:41:58.827
Give up my life,
my heart, my home

01:42:03.748 --> 01:42:07.293
If you feel like singing a song

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.423
And you want other people to sing along

01:42:11.673 --> 01:42:15.093
Then just sing what you feel

01:42:15.635 --> 01:42:19.180
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

01:42:21.641 --> 01:42:25.270
And if you're trying to paint a picture

01:42:25.437 --> 01:42:29.399
But you're not sure which colors belong

01:42:29.858 --> 01:42:33.028
Just paint what you see

01:42:33.862 --> 01:42:35.530
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

01:42:35.697 --> 01:42:37.073
Hey!

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.409
Kyra17-1, what's up?

01:42:39.576 --> 01:42:43.121
I told you, the dash is silent.

01:42:44.998 --> 01:42:48.335
Or stung awake in the night

01:42:49.252 --> 01:42:52.213
It's all right to be frightened

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.466
When there's a light

01:42:54.632 --> 01:42:56.509
What light?

01:42:56.676 --> 01:42:58.511
There's a light

01:42:58.678 --> 01:43:00.555
What light?

01:43:00.722 --> 01:43:02.724
There's a light

01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:04.768
White light

01:43:04.934 --> 01:43:06.770
There's a light

01:43:06.936 --> 01:43:08.688
White light

01:43:08.855 --> 01:43:10.899
Well, there's a light

01:43:11.066 --> 01:43:12.942
One light

01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:15.070
There's a light

01:43:15.236 --> 01:43:17.072
White light

01:43:17.238 --> 01:43:18.239
And there's a light

01:43:18.406 --> 01:43:20.116
Dear Will Burton,

01:43:20.283 --> 01:43:22.285
it says on your MySpace page

01:43:22.452 --> 01:43:25.872
that you manage I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

01:43:26.039 --> 01:43:27.332
Nice name.

01:43:27.499 --> 01:43:29.250
I really like your band.

01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:33.338
You know, I'm starting an indie label.

01:43:33.797 --> 01:43:35.256
Are you signed to anyone?

01:43:35.423 --> 01:43:39.344
Maybe we can sit down and have a chat.

01:43:40.637 --> 01:43:43.181
Oh, my God!

01:43:47.227 --> 01:43:49.020
All the best.

01:43:49.187 --> 01:43:51.773
David Bowie.

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.775
White light

01:43:53.942 --> 01:43:55.694
Well, there's a light

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.737
White light

01:43:57.904 --> 01:43:59.823
There's a light

01:43:59.989 --> 01:44:01.991
White light

01:44:02.158 --> 01:44:04.119
There's a light

01:44:04.285 --> 01:44:06.162
White light

01:44:06.329 --> 01:44:07.956
There's a light

01:44:08.123 --> 01:44:10.166
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:44:10.333 --> 01:44:12.627
Smile.

01:44:17.007 --> 01:44:18.466
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:44:18.633 --> 01:44:20.719
- You look great.
- Thanks.

01:44:20.885 --> 01:44:25.849
It's my new makeup,
"I Can't Wear Blush, I'll Wear Blush. "

01:44:26.975 --> 01:44:29.477
Hey, you got room for one more?
No!

01:44:29.644 --> 01:44:30.562
Shotgun.
No way.

01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:34.441
I called shotgun like an hour ago.

01:45:11.227 --> 01:45:14.189
Don't it blow your mind?

01:45:14.356 --> 01:45:17.776
Don't it blow your mind like the first time?

01:45:17.942 --> 01:45:21.654
Circle of voices
in a crowded room

01:45:24.407 --> 01:45:27.952
Plays in my head
so out of time

01:45:30.622 --> 01:45:34.668
Kill me with kindness
never enough I find

01:45:36.628 --> 01:45:39.673
Don't it blow your mind?

01:45:39.839 --> 01:45:42.759
Don't it blow your mind again?

01:45:42.926 --> 01:45:47.097
Don't it blow your mind for the third time?

01:45:47.347 --> 01:45:50.517
The dream is never over

01:45:53.561 --> 01:45:56.731
The dream is never over

01:45:59.150 --> 01:46:03.238
Envision a future still in black and white

01:46:05.573 --> 01:46:09.035
Colors of youth run into gold

01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:16.001
Blue is for sorrow,
red is for sadder light

01:46:17.836 --> 01:46:20.839
Don't it blow your mind?

01:46:21.006 --> 01:46:24.009
Don't it blow your mind again?

01:46:24.175 --> 01:46:28.221
Don't it blow your mind for the third time?

01:46:28.388 --> 01:46:31.558
The dream is never over

01:46:34.644 --> 01:46:37.814
The dream is never over

01:47:02.130 --> 01:47:04.716
To my favorite teacher

01:47:04.883 --> 01:47:06.885
Told me never give up

01:47:07.052 --> 01:47:09.346
To my fifth grade crush

01:47:09.512 --> 01:47:11.723
Who I thought I really loved

01:47:11.890 --> 01:47:15.977
To the guys I miss
and the girls we kissed

01:47:16.686 --> 01:47:19.606
Where are you now?

01:47:21.608 --> 01:47:23.818
To my ex-best friends

01:47:23.985 --> 01:47:26.237
Don't know how we grew apart

01:47:26.404 --> 01:47:28.698
To my favorite band

01:47:28.865 --> 01:47:31.117
And sing-alongs in my car

01:47:31.284 --> 01:47:34.871
To the face I see
in my memories

01:47:36.122 --> 01:47:39.042
Where are you now?

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:43.213
Where are you now?

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.674
'Cause I'm thinking of you

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.009
You showed me how

01:47:48.176 --> 01:47:50.470
How to live like I do

01:47:50.637 --> 01:47:52.847
If it wasn't for you

01:47:53.014 --> 01:47:56.267
I would never be who I am

01:48:00.355 --> 01:48:02.732
To my first girlfriend

01:48:02.899 --> 01:48:05.110
I thought for sure
was the one

01:48:05.276 --> 01:48:07.487
To my last girlfriend

01:48:07.654 --> 01:48:09.989
Sorry that I screwed it up

01:48:10.156 --> 01:48:12.742
To the ones I loved

01:48:12.909 --> 01:48:14.786
Didn't show it enough

01:48:14.953 --> 01:48:17.872
Where are you now?

01:48:19.833 --> 01:48:22.002
Where are you now?

01:48:22.168 --> 01:48:24.504
'Cause I'm thinking of you

01:48:24.671 --> 01:48:26.881
You showed me how

01:48:27.048 --> 01:48:29.342
How to live like I do

01:48:29.509 --> 01:48:31.845
If it wasn't for you

01:48:32.012 --> 01:48:35.265
I would never be who I am

01:48:37.851 --> 01:48:41.813
I know we'll never see
those days again

01:48:42.772 --> 01:48:46.359
And things will never
be that way again

01:48:46.526 --> 01:48:48.778
But that's just how it goes

01:48:48.945 --> 01:48:51.156
People change but I know

01:48:51.322 --> 01:48:54.242
I won't forget you

01:49:13.178 --> 01:49:15.805
To the ones who cared

01:49:15.972 --> 01:49:17.891
And who were there
from the start

01:49:18.058 --> 01:49:20.435
To the love that left

01:49:20.602 --> 01:49:22.687
And took a piece of my heart

01:49:22.854 --> 01:49:25.315
To the few who'd swear

01:49:25.482 --> 01:49:27.734
They'd never go anywhere

01:49:27.901 --> 01:49:30.820
Where are you now?

01:49:32.655 --> 01:49:35.075
Where are you now?

01:49:35.241 --> 01:49:37.452
'Cause I'm thinking of you

01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:39.746
You showed me how

01:49:39.913 --> 01:49:42.290
How to live like I do

01:49:42.457 --> 01:49:44.751
If it wasn't for you

01:49:44.918 --> 01:49:48.171
I would never be who I am

01:49:52.217 --> 01:49:54.469
If it wasn't for you

01:49:54.636 --> 01:49:57.889
I would never be who I am

01:50:01.851 --> 01:50:04.104
If it wasn't for you

01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:06.981
I'd be nothing
