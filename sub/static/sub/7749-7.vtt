WEBVTT

00:04.570 --> 00:06.731
GRUBICK: Kalinda Sharma works
closely on Mr. Agos' cases,

00:06.770 --> 00:08.590
as well as being
a social acquaintance.

00:08.640 --> 00:12.235
But my report advises that the
court's rulings are paramount.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.305
GLA'I'I': ASA Polmar,
you agree with these
added restrictions?

00:14.340 --> 00:16.570
We do, Your Honor.
All right, then the
bail is approved

00:16.610 --> 00:18.202
but only with
these further

00:18.250 --> 00:19.512
restrictions applying.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.541
And if you break the rules
again, young man,

00:21.580 --> 00:23.411
your bail will be revoked,
and you will spend

00:23.450 --> 00:24.587
the remainder
of your time

00:24.620 --> 00:26.588
before trial
behind bars.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.588
POLMAR: Your Honor,
we ask for an extension

00:28.620 --> 00:30.554
in the speedy trial provision.
DIANE: No.
Your Honor,

00:30.590 --> 00:32.421
it is my client's
constitutional right

00:32.460 --> 00:33.597
to a speedy trial.
Yes, and if

00:33.630 --> 00:35.052
your client hadn't had
some involvement

00:35.100 --> 00:36.419
in the disappearance
of our key witness...

00:36.470 --> 00:37.664
He had nothing to do
with that disappearance.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.519
POLMAR: He has
flaunted the dictates

00:38.570 --> 00:40.458
of his bail, Your Honor,
again and again.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.535
GLA'I'I': Wait, wait, wait.
Shut up.

00:41.570 --> 00:43.333
Now, how many days until trial?

00:43.370 --> 00:45.235
DIANE:
58, Your Honor,
as required

00:45.270 --> 00:46.476
by the speedy
trial provision.
And how many

00:46.510 --> 00:47.602
more days
do you need beyond that?

00:47.640 --> 00:49.073
Your Honor, my
client's reputation...

00:49.110 --> 00:50.646
Damn it,
Counselor!

00:50.680 --> 00:54.571
Will everybody, everybody
just answer what I ask. Okay?

00:54.620 --> 00:56.815
How long an extension?
60 more days.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.283
That will give us time to locate

00:58.320 --> 00:59.651
the missing witness,
Trey Wagner.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.681
If he's alive.
Yes, if he's still alive.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.154
DIANE: Finding Trey Wagner?
That's a Hail Mary pass.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.726
GLA'I'I':
On that I agree.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.648
Unfortunately, Mr. Polmar,
I'm gonna deny your motion,

01:07.700 --> 01:08.689
and the trial will begin

01:08.730 --> 01:10.527
on schedule

01:10.570 --> 01:12.367
in 58 days.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.436
(sighs):
Damn it.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.199
So I heard--
no extensmn?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.707
Yeah.
What's your plan?

01:17.740 --> 01:18.559
I'm formulating a plan.

01:18.610 --> 01:19.872
Formulate it faster.
Hey.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.730
Let me do my job.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.767
*

01:56.680 --> 01:58.875
Cary was a good prosecutor.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.242
He just wasn't ready
for being deputy.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.748
So did he resign willingly,
or was he pressured?

02:03.790 --> 02:06.554
Mr. Agos resigned
for "fraternizing

02:06.590 --> 02:08.558
with a coworker."
Come on, Geneva,
the longer

02:08.590 --> 02:10.353
that I work here,
the more I realize

02:10.390 --> 02:12.255
there's always a reason
behind the reason.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.619
Cary was gone for a few weeks
on administrative leave.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.230
I never got
the whole story.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.534
Everybody guessed
it contributed
to his resignation.

02:21.570 --> 02:22.798
When was this?

02:22.840 --> 02:24.637
Three years ago.
And so you're the one

02:24.670 --> 02:26.331
who complained
about Cary?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.836
No, I just don't want my partner

02:27.880 --> 02:29.541
to get blamed
for missing evidence.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.707
Cary lost evidence?
All I know is

02:31.750 --> 02:32.819
the chain of custody
was intact

02:32.850 --> 02:34.772
between us
and the deputy SA.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.742
We had a call
from the crime lab

02:36.790 --> 02:38.587
asking where
the evidence was.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.850
Where what was?
What was the evidence?

02:40.890 --> 02:42.653
Cocaine.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.885
Two kilos.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.659
It never showed up at my lab.
Cary said

02:46.700 --> 02:49.498
that he delivered
the cocaine to you.
To the lab,

02:49.530 --> 02:50.895
yeah, but there was no record.

02:50.930 --> 02:53.569
And he never signed it
out of the evidence room,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.739
which made it all
very SUSplCIOUS.
Why wasn't there

02:55.770 --> 02:56.600
a bigger investigation?
Nobody wanted

02:56.640 --> 02:58.699
to point out deficiencies
in the office.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.777
Especially when it had
to do with the Bishop case.

03:03.610 --> 03:06.738
This is about Bishop?
Yeah. We never
could prove it

03:06.780 --> 03:08.941
'cause the evidence
went missmg.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.657
Thanks.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.497
(sighs)

03:24.300 --> 03:26.291
Good day, huh?
Actually,

03:26.340 --> 03:27.466
pretty good.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.831
You?
Well, I'm learning

03:28.870 --> 03:30.667
how to campaign.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.507
It's like learning
a new language.
Well,

03:32.540 --> 03:34.303
you got Castro worried.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.479
He is not a happy
boy these days.
Yeah, we're up

03:36.510 --> 03:39.479
by eight points, but I don't
know how long that'll last.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.789
You know when something good
happens to you, but...

03:44.820 --> 03:47.459
it means something bad is
gonna happen to someone else?

03:47.490 --> 03:48.787
I think so. Why?

03:48.820 --> 03:51.618
(lawyers talking nearby)

03:51.660 --> 03:53.491
Come with me.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.468
Cary is in trouble.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.330
I know.

04:01.370 --> 04:02.860
Worse trouble.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.003
Okay. How?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.735
I can't tell you.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.543
But it could hurt you,
the campaign.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.774
You have to isolate
yourself...

04:10.810 --> 04:12.038
You can't tell me what happened?

04:12.080 --> 04:13.547
I can't.

04:13.580 --> 04:14.979
But believe me.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.982
I got to go.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.951
*

04:28.800 --> 04:31.894
DIANE: How are you
with the office?

04:31.930 --> 04:35.331
Good. It's odd to be back.
That's what Cary said.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.772
Finn isn't ready.
Speedy trial strategy's

04:42.810 --> 04:46.473
working for us.
There might be something
coming down the pike on Cary.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.818
I can't say what, but...

04:48.850 --> 04:50.647
is there anything
we overlooked?

04:50.690 --> 04:53.511
I mean, a million things--
there always are.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.686
What's your worry?

04:54.720 --> 04:57.086
I don't know.
Maybe nothing.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.519
Your husband's on the
news talking about you.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.926
PETER:
You know, it reminds me
of what President Kennedy said

05:01.960 --> 05:03.996
when he appointed his brother
as attorney general.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.590
Something to the effect of:
I can't see it as wrong

05:06.640 --> 05:07.959
to give him
a little legal experience...

05:08.000 --> 05:09.831
BOTH: Before he goes out
to practice law.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.907
Oh, that was back when you
could joke in politics.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.738
But to be clear... Alic_ia
actually has more experience

05:15.780 --> 05:18.499
than Robert F. Kennedy did
when he was attorney general.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.017
You sound proud.
I am proud.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.712
Let's turn then to
a subject that's been

05:22.750 --> 05:24.581
all over the news lately:

05:24.620 --> 05:25.848
militarizing
law enforcement.

05:25.890 --> 05:26.914
The rise of the
warrior cop.
Yes.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.416
Imagine something
like Ferguson

05:28.460 --> 05:29.586
happening in Chicago--

05:29.630 --> 05:30.983
would you feel comfortable

05:31.030 --> 05:32.850
using police officers
carrying automatic weapons,

05:32.900 --> 05:34.720
driving around in Humvees?

05:34.760 --> 05:36.466
PETER:
No, I wouldn't say
comfortable, no.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.627
This is a civil rights
issue, and I do...

05:38.670 --> 05:39.898
Warren Plep.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.794
Eli.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.933
(soft chuckle):
Hey. What's up?

05:43.970 --> 05:44.959
What are you
doing here, Warren?

05:45.010 --> 05:46.432
Nothing. You?

05:46.480 --> 05:49.005
Just supporting my boy.
Ah.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.008
So you just happened in
off the street?

05:51.050 --> 05:53.075
No. I know someone here.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.769
A friend.
VVho?

05:54.820 --> 05:56.117
Matt.

05:56.150 --> 05:57.742
Baloo.

05:57.790 --> 05:58.779
Really?
Hmm.

05:58.820 --> 06:01.459
Baloo? Like in
The Jungle Book?

06:01.490 --> 06:03.082
He's a producer here.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.019
Good seeing you, Eli.
Got to go.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.893
You're still the king
of petition drives,
aren't you, Warren?

06:11.930 --> 06:13.932
I still dabble.
You need something?
I might.

06:13.970 --> 06:17.133
Unless you're already employed.
Why would I be employed?

06:17.170 --> 06:20.003
I'm just trying to figure out
what you're doing here, Warren.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.871
You don't go anywhere
without good reason.

06:21.910 --> 06:23.878
I've already told you my reason.

06:23.910 --> 06:25.946
I have to go.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.880
PETER:
...protected police officers

06:30.920 --> 06:32.979
under the doctrine
of qualified immunity.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.580
INTERVIEWER:
But that trend has reversed,
hasn't it?

06:36.860 --> 06:37.986
I don't...

06:38.030 --> 06:39.895
quite know what
you're referring to.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.569
I'm thinking of this, uh,
recent 2nd Circuit case.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.865
SWAT team in Connecticut
smashed down a door...

06:45.900 --> 06:49.028
*
(continues inaudibly)

06:49.070 --> 06:50.867
I wasn't prepared for it.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.674
I looked like an idiot.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.075
Eli.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.044
You-you didn't look
like an idiot.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.514
I need a new personal
attorney, Eli-- someone

06:59.550 --> 07:01.040
to keep me up to speed
on these issues.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.810
I'll make up a list.
Put Ramona on it, would you?

07:03.850 --> 07:05.488
What?
Ramona Lytton.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.509
Put her on the list.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.118
The mother of the intern?

07:08.160 --> 07:09.752
Well, she's not
just the mother

07:09.790 --> 07:10.950
of the intern, she's a lavwer

07:10.990 --> 07:13.754
and a family friend,
and she needs a job.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.927
When was the last time
she practiced, Mr. Governor?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.463
When's the last time Alicia did?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.491
Put her on the list.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.807
We have a problem.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.068
(indistinct chatter)
Wait. Wait!

07:28.110 --> 07:29.805
The problem is the opposite.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.819
We have too much space now
and too few lawyers.

07:32.850 --> 07:35.171
So we lease it back.
Yes, but if we grow,
we'll be overcharged.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.073
Lease it out.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.008
Lease out the 27th floor.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.553
We've got 20 offices
downstairs.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.818
Lease them out
to other businesses.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.953
DIANE:
Well, all right, can we all
have just a quiet discussion

07:43.990 --> 07:45.878
about leasing?

07:45.930 --> 07:47.488
What happened?

07:47.530 --> 07:49.623
We think a third candidate's
joining the race.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.167
So, this is your office now?

07:56.200 --> 07:57.633
It's nice.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.035
Aren't we past
the filing deadline?

07:59.070 --> 08:01.004
How can anybody
be joining the race?

08:01.040 --> 08:03.099
Well, if you gather
50,000 signatures,

08:03.150 --> 08:04.276
you can run by petition.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.744
And is anyone doing that?
Warren Plep

08:06.780 --> 08:07.974
is a DC petition bundler.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.817
He gathers signatures
for petitions

08:09.850 --> 08:11.784
in California
and New York.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.550
I saw him at the CBS studios
during Peter's interview.

08:14.590 --> 08:17.718
Why? Why was he there?
Well, he wouldn't
say, but...

08:17.760 --> 08:20.149
my guess is Frank Prady.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.619
The commentator?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.661
Yes.
And that would
not be good?

08:25.700 --> 08:27.759
No, it would be terrible.
He's a brand.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.064
Yes, and he's a bigger
brand than you,
so we've got to do

08:30.110 --> 08:31.634
some polling.
It might mean nothing.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.604
It could be for another office.
Yes, but we've

08:33.640 --> 08:35.198
looked back over his broadcast
commentary for the last

08:35.240 --> 08:37.105
three months, and he's
disgusted with the murder rate

08:37.150 --> 08:38.777
in Chicago and he hates
how Castro's fighting it.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.243
(tapping on door)

08:40.280 --> 08:42.214
We've been called back into
court, so we're heading out.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.013
On your case?

08:44.050 --> 08:45.586
Yeah. Should be
about an hour.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.281
Do you know what it's about?
No,

08:47.320 --> 08:48.958
no-- maybe it's good news.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.150
Maybe they're
dropping the charges.

08:51.190 --> 08:53.055
Good luck.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.625
ALICIA:
So, what do we do now?

08:55.660 --> 08:56.922
We find out
if it's true.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.289
And how do
we do that?

08:58.330 --> 09:01.094
You go to Prady, and you
ask for his endorsement.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.301
What?
ELI: _
He's endorsed candidates
In other races.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.229
If he does endorse you,
then clearly he's not running.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.876
If he doesn't, then... there
might be some problem there.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.105
If he runs, I lose?

09:12.150 --> 09:13.845
Well, anything
can happen, b...
Yes,

09:13.880 --> 09:15.142
you lose.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.115
GLA'I'I':
Okay,

09:18.150 --> 09:19.879
here we are again.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.717
What's going on, Counselor?
It's not us, Your Honor.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.682
It seems the ASA has
something up his sleeve.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
A Proof of Other Crimes charge,
Your Honor.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.194
Your Honor, uh,
that is just wrong.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.095
My client is innocent,
and the state's attorney

09:31.130 --> 09:33.735
is conducting a vendetta.
We're not conducting
a vendetta.

09:33.770 --> 09:35.328
Mr. Agos used to be an ASA,
Your Honor,

09:35.370 --> 09:36.769
and while he was working here,

09:36.810 --> 09:39.108
he was also secretly
working for Lemond Bishop.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.607
What?
That is ridiculous.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.902
Top drug dealer...
And that is slanderous,

09:41.940 --> 09:42.907
Your Honor.
God Almighty,

09:42.950 --> 09:44.178
stop it!

09:44.210 --> 09:46.770
I'm the one in control here.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.243
What evidence do you have?
We have evidence

09:49.280 --> 09:51.089
that Mr. Agos,
when a deputy ASA,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.088
buried evidence against
his one-time client,

09:53.120 --> 09:55.111
Bishop, allowing Mr. Bishop
to avoid prosecution.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.186
Now... the evidence against him

09:58.230 --> 10:00.255
was two kilos of cocaine,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.256
which went missing after
the defendant, Mr. Agos,

10:02.300 --> 10:03.528
removed it from
the evrdence room.
Now, the prosecution

10:03.570 --> 10:07.688
merely asks that they be allowed
to use this evidence at trial.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.198
Bring this evidence tomorrow,
and I will hear on this motion.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.629
DIANE:
Your Honor...
No. Everybody shut up.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.205
(excited chatter)
I already ruled.
That's it.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.879
*

10:31.990 --> 10:33.958
RECEPTIONIST:
Governor Florrick's office.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.195
(elevator bell dings)

10:42.300 --> 10:44.439
Ramona?
(chuckles)

10:44.470 --> 10:47.200
Alicia, I thought
that was you.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.231
Oh, my gosh.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.248
What has it been, ten years?
You look great.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.838
Thank you.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.177
What are you doing here?
A job interview.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.847
Can you believe it?

10:55.880 --> 10:58.314
For the legal job here.
That's great.

10:58.350 --> 10:59.783
They need someone like you.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.253
Where are you coming from?

11:01.290 --> 11:02.723
Where am I...?

11:02.760 --> 11:03.954
What firm?

11:03.990 --> 11:05.389
Oh.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.159
Nowhere. Home.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.156
Been raising two
kids, you know.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.225
Yes. Of course. I'm sorry.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.931
Don't be.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.938
It's my first interview
in, um...

11:14.970 --> 11:17.359
12 years.
That's great.
You'll be great.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.800
That's exactly what I did.
I know. I'm modeling my
career after yours.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.068
(laughs)

11:22.110 --> 11:23.907
Uh, don't do that.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.269
How's Anton?

11:25.310 --> 11:27.744
We divorced last year.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.146
He's in Nashville,
I think.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.146
Oh, Ramona, I'm sorry.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.249
I keep stepping right in it.
No,

11:34.290 --> 11:36.383
you're great.
(chuckles)
Well,

11:36.420 --> 11:38.285
I probably...
Sure.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.388
Thank you.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.988
You're welcome.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.292
Good luck.

11:42.330 --> 11:43.866
ELI:
He wants to meet

11:43.900 --> 11:46.198
at 2:00 today.
Okay, good.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.369
Why do you two
look so nervous?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.402
We don't want him
in the race.
I know. Neither do I.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.977
We have a few issues
we'd like you to talk about.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.979
His mother was attacked a year
ago at her retirement community,

11:56.010 --> 11:58.171
and she was left with
20 stitches in her forehead.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.917
Okay. So...

12:00.950 --> 12:03.418
you want me to bring that up?
No, try to talk

12:03.450 --> 12:05.782
about crimes against seniors
and how you're gonna push

12:05.820 --> 12:07.253
for stronger prosecutions.
That's a bit

12:07.290 --> 12:09.178
unsubtle, isn't it?
Alicia,

12:09.220 --> 12:12.053
you're not writing a poem--
you're practicing politics.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.955
Also, try to scare him off
from running by suggesting

12:14.000 --> 12:15.888
how much money you have
in your PAC.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.522
How do I do that?
You're asking for
his endorsement.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.765
It makes sense that you'd bring
up your grassroots support.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.358
And don't mention
his Supreme Court book.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.537
He was disappointed
with the sales.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.367
Okay, this is getting silly.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.968
Just set it up. I'll be good.

12:26.010 --> 12:27.272
Also, he's a
fan of history.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.437
Cold War history.
I selected a few quotes.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.971
No.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.980
POLMAR:
So Mr. Agos insisted

12:36.020 --> 12:38.079
on taking over all
of Lemond Bishop's cases?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.519
Yes.
And this was
when he first

12:39.550 --> 12:40.983
joined
the State's Attorney's Office?

12:41.020 --> 12:42.248
No,
when he was

12:42.290 --> 12:44.451
elevated to deputy.
And had he shown

12:44.490 --> 12:47.459
any interest in the Bishop cases
previously?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.822
GENEVA:
Cary checked in with me
pretty regularly, wanting

12:50.870 --> 12:53.464
to know how far along
the investigation was,

12:53.500 --> 12:56.230
if we were building
a strong case.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.999
And what did you
tell Mr. Agos?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.530
The bail restrictions. I have
to keep 30 feet between us.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.504
I know. I need
your help on this.

13:01.540 --> 13:04.338
They're trying to imply
that Cary was secretly working

13:04.380 --> 13:06.541
for Bishop when he was
at the SA's Office.

13:06.580 --> 13:10.186
You're kidding.
No, it's all supposition
and happenstance,

13:10.220 --> 13:12.085
but it's effective.
Thank you.
Nothing further.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.088
See what you can dig up
to battle it.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.486
Counselor, excuse me.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.488
Sorry to break up
the important meeting

13:18.530 --> 13:20.452
you're having back there,
but we're waiting.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.389
Yes, Your Honor. My apologies.

13:23.430 --> 13:26.422
Ms. Pine, uh, you were already
at the SA's Office

13:26.470 --> 13:27.994
when Cary joined?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.201
I was.
And do you remember
the reason

13:30.240 --> 13:32.037
that he left private practice
to come over?

13:32.070 --> 13:33.901
Calls for speculation.
GLA'I'I':
Damn right. Try again.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.909
(phone vibrates)
DIANE: Would you say that
Cary is a competitive person?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.269
POLMAR:
Your Honor.
GLA'I'I': We've already established

13:38.310 --> 13:40.073
that she is his colleague,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.577
not his therapist.
DIANE: The prosecution's direct
suggested

13:42.620 --> 13:44.349
that my
client took

13:44.390 --> 13:46.187
the Bishop case
for no reason.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.915
It is within the scope to show
that he took

13:47.960 --> 13:50.224
a high-profile case
in order to prove himself.
(phone vibrates)

13:50.260 --> 13:52.353
POLMAR:
And now she's testifying.
GLA'I'I': Mr. Agos is free

13:52.390 --> 13:54.199
to take
the stand

13:54.230 --> 13:55.857
and explain
his own state of mind.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.596
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.461
(phone vibrates)
Ms. Pine,
how long

14:00.500 --> 14:02.468
did you run the investigation

14:02.500 --> 14:04.434
into Lemond Bishop's
drug organization?

14:04.470 --> 14:06.267
Almost two years.
Mm-hmm.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.278
And during that time,
how many charges

14:08.310 --> 14:10.449
did you file against Mr. Bishop?

14:10.480 --> 14:13.017
None.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.574
DIANE:
Really? None?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.542
(phone vibrates)
So isn't it likely

14:16.580 --> 14:18.286
that they gave the Bishop cases

14:18.320 --> 14:19.446
to somebody
who could do better?

14:19.490 --> 14:21.014
POLMAR:
Objection.
Argumentative.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.654
GLA'I'I':
No. No,
overruled.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.487
I want
to hear it.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.589
GENEVA:
Yes.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.518
It's possible.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.619
Alicia. In here.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.389
Sorry. I was just
getting changed.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.032
No, thank you for
meeting with me.

14:36.070 --> 14:38.334
Are you kidding?
I'm a fan. Don't make fun

14:38.370 --> 14:40.338
of my cheeks.
It's makeup for camera.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.177
Wow, Frank.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.404
A bit of a sweet tooth?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.577
No. Do you like
cookies?

14:45.610 --> 14:47.339
You have to have some.
Please.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.177
Uh, two tins.
Three tins, at least.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.017
I'm all right.
Thank you, though.

14:51.050 --> 14:53.257
Oh, it's these ladies online.
They have a-a fan club.

14:53.290 --> 14:56.589
And they get it into their heads
that I like certain things.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.350
Last year they thought
I was getting too much sun,

14:59.390 --> 15:01.426
so they sent me Panama hats.
(chuckles)

15:01.460 --> 15:04.429
Well, you must have a lot
of fans.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.461
Well, not as
many as you.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.229
I'm sure that's not true.

15:08.270 --> 15:09.999
No, I'm sure it is.
Well,

15:10.040 --> 15:11.166
we're both popular then.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.268
Glad we settled that.

15:12.310 --> 15:13.470
(laughs)

15:13.510 --> 15:14.477
So...
Yes.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.102
You must be wondering
why I asked

15:16.140 --> 15:18.074
to meet with you.
No, my producer said,

15:18.110 --> 15:19.475
and I think it's
a great idea.

15:19.510 --> 15:22.445
Oh, he-he did? Really?
What did he say?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.311
That you wanted to pitch
yourself for an interview.

15:24.350 --> 15:27.183
Oh. No, actually.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.552
But thank you.

15:29.590 --> 15:32.354
The state's attorney's race,

15:32.390 --> 15:34.551
I'm running.
Yes, I know. Condolences.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.022
I mean, congratulations.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.220
Thank you.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.694
And I was hoping
to encourage you to...

15:42.600 --> 15:44.704
...to endorse me.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.628
I hate
just asking,

15:46.670 --> 15:50.049
but I... Well, Ijust did.
(chuckles)

15:50.080 --> 15:51.240
So there.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.316
Huh.
Uh,

15:53.350 --> 15:55.545
that is different.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.743
And just so you know a little
bit about what I stand for,

15:58.790 --> 16:02.419
Chicago has one of
the worst records in the country

16:02.460 --> 16:04.621
prosecuting federal gun crimes,

16:04.660 --> 16:08.255
which means the SA's Office
has to pick up the slack.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.137
And... I don't know
if you've seen the statistics

16:15.170 --> 16:17.058
on crime against the elderly,

16:17.110 --> 16:21.001
but I would really want
to beef up

16:21.040 --> 16:23.349
on penalties for elder crime.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.178
Great. Good.

16:26.210 --> 16:30.146
Just so you know,
that's not true.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.579
About my mom
getting beaten up.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.259
It was another lady
in her retirement community.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.121
The press got it wrong.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.219
Ah.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.058
Well, no, I didn't know that.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.522
Um...

16:44.570 --> 16:47.539
But it doesn't matter anyway.
Uh...

16:47.570 --> 16:51.358
I still feel bad
for that... lady,

16:51.410 --> 16:55.232
and, um, I believe it.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.169
The elderly crime...

16:58.210 --> 17:00.110
thing.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.277
ELI: _
He gave you cookies?

17:02.320 --> 17:04.345
Yes.
And an interview spot.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.085
But no
endorsement?

17:06.120 --> 17:09.214
No. He said he wanted
to talk more in the interview.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.251
I'm not good
at this, guys.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.258
I'm bad at asking for things.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.224
I don't like asking...
Alicia, listen to me,

17:16.260 --> 17:18.421
you're running for office.
The very nature of your job

17:18.470 --> 17:20.199
is asking for things.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.196
Votes, money, help.
It's a talent.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.561
That's how politicians
get you to love them,

17:24.610 --> 17:27.431
not by giving you something
but asking for something.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.630
So you just got
to get over your...

17:29.680 --> 17:32.274
feeling
that you're above all this.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.471
JOHNNY:
The real question is,
do we do the interview?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.078
It could be a setup.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.587
He uses a bad interview
as a springboard

17:37.620 --> 17:38.746
to launch his own campaign.
ELI:
It's an audience.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.109
We have to.
Yeah.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.752
All right. We prep
for hardball questions.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.155
We make him think
we're going in soft

17:43.190 --> 17:44.487
and then we go
for the jugular.
Okay.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.554
All right, I'll
handle the prep.

17:45.590 --> 17:47.126
ELI:
I'll go and, uh...

17:47.160 --> 17:49.720
(Johnny and Eli
continue indistinctly)

17:49.760 --> 17:51.569
Where did you recover
the two kilos of cocaine,

17:51.600 --> 17:53.158
Officer Sprayberry?
Stash house

17:53.200 --> 17:55.191
on Kinzie Street tied
to Lemond Bishop.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.129
And did you ever see the cocaine
that you believed belonged

17:58.170 --> 18:00.229
to Mr. Bishop again
after you checked it in?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.304
No.
Do you...

18:01.340 --> 18:03.274
normally see evidence again

18:03.310 --> 18:05.278
after you check it in?
Standard operating
procedure

18:05.310 --> 18:07.210
is for the recovering
officer to transport it

18:07.250 --> 18:10.845
for testing.
But Mr. Agos insisted on taking
this cocaine to the lab.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.814
Yes. He said he needed
a quick check, off the books,

18:13.860 --> 18:15.259
so they could link
it to Bishop.
And you let him.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.848
Well, deputy SAs
have a lot of clout.

18:16.890 --> 18:20.428
And he said this was the
fastest way to take down Bishop.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.223
And was it?
No.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.568
Once the cocaine disappeared,

18:23.600 --> 18:25.329
the case disappeared.
Thank you.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.258
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.234
DIANE:
Be honest with me,

18:29.270 --> 18:31.238
how do I defend
against this?

18:31.270 --> 18:34.205
I don't know.
Well, what did you do?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.674
I checked the cocaine out
to take it to the lab myself.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.746
Why?

18:38.780 --> 18:40.771
To expedite it.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.711
Cary, this testimony
is killing us.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.253
I know.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.713
(phone ringing)

18:52.260 --> 18:54.251
Cary Agos.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.289
KALIN DA:
It's me.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.163
Where are you?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.395
Turn around.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.601
This is crazy.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.607
I know.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.302
30 feet.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.444
You saw what they were doing
in court?

19:10.480 --> 19:11.799
Yeah.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.647
I also know _
who you're protecting.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.547
VVho?
Peter.

19:16.580 --> 19:20.186
That's why you broke the rules
at the State's Attorney's Office

19:20.220 --> 19:22.188
and took the cocaine to the lab.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.380
Because Peter asked you to.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.829
He was eyeing the governorship

19:24.860 --> 19:27.328
and he knew that
a Bishop conviction would help.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.419
That's supposition, Kalinda.
No, it isn't.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.688
You have to defend yourself,
Cary.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.618
He did nothing wrong.
Then subpoena him

19:32.670 --> 19:33.898
and have him say that.
He has
nothing to do

19:33.940 --> 19:35.362
with the coke going missing.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.492
Well, neither do you.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.963
But they'll crucify him.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.898
Cary, they're crucifying you.

19:40.940 --> 19:45.377
Look, you have to tell them
that you were under orders.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.843
I can't.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.643
Then I will.

19:48.680 --> 19:49.647
Kalinda,

19:49.680 --> 19:51.341
no.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.743
Kalinda.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.348
KaHnda?

19:54.390 --> 19:56.517
30 feet, Cary.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.966
(indistinct chatter)

20:12.010 --> 20:15.377
Ramona, welcome.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.878
How was your first day of
school? You find the lunchroom?

20:17.910 --> 20:19.275
No, but that's okay. I...
It's the next floor down.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.777
Just off the elevator.
Okay. Great.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.913
Um, there's something
that came across my desk...

20:22.950 --> 20:24.747
(phone rings)
The papenNork for
the new offices. Don't worry.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.485
That's not time sensitive.
I have to take this.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.283
Do you mind? Yep.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.550
Mm-hmm.

20:30.590 --> 20:33.559
What? Mm-hmm.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.556
Mm-hmm.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.818
W...

20:37.870 --> 20:40.464
PETER: Why am I being
subpoenaed?
ELI: Because
Diane wants to drag you

20:40.500 --> 20:42.934
into this Proof of
Other Crime nonsense.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.564
You think this has to do with
the Supreme Court rejection?
Of course it has

20:45.610 --> 20:46.736
to do with the Supreme Court
rejection. It says here

20:46.770 --> 20:49.534
that you ordered Cary to
violate evidence-handling rules

20:49.580 --> 20:52.504
in order to push a
high-profile prosecution.
This is

20:52.550 --> 20:53.619
a nightmare.
We need _to file
a motion

20:53.650 --> 20:54.617
based on privilege.
Yes.

20:54.650 --> 20:56.470
Good idea.
I don't...

20:56.520 --> 20:58.613
I'm gonna meet with Cary. I know
he doesn't want to go there.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.379
I know that.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.012
How about that
for a first day, huh?

21:02.060 --> 21:03.687
I'll have one of the
paralegals help you

21:03.730 --> 21:05.550
file a motion to quash
based on privilege.

21:05.590 --> 21:08.696
I don't think we should do that.

21:08.730 --> 21:09.958
What do
you mean?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.558
Why?
Ramona,

21:11.600 --> 21:12.624
uh, let's discuss this.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.592
No, wait. I want to know why.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.408
They're expecting us to do it.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.579
They want us

21:22.610 --> 21:25.579
to argue that any conversation
between the then SA

21:25.610 --> 21:28.716
and Mr. Agos is privileged
work product.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.639
They want it to look like
you're covering something up.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.682
So... don't.

21:36.490 --> 21:37.457
Okay.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.526
What would you do?

21:42.500 --> 21:44.092
Go on offensive.

21:44.130 --> 21:47.634
No matter what Mr. Agos
was told by his superior,

21:47.670 --> 21:50.764
it doesn't excuse him from
havmg committed a crime.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.472
I can file a motion to quash
based on relevance.

21:53.510 --> 21:54.807
The governor
isn't hiding anything.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.478
He is busy.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.478
_ And the defense
IS merely trying to stall

21:58.510 --> 22:00.410
by dragging him into this.

22:01.650 --> 22:02.639
Do it.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.615
Thank you, Mr. Governor.

22:07.050 --> 22:10.554
Oh, and, um...
I wouldn't talk to Cary.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.057
They'll use it against you.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.999
(door closes)
Not bad, huh?

22:17.030 --> 22:19.419
We'll see.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.438
Isn't your law partner
facing drug conspiracy

22:21.470 --> 22:22.892
charges, Mrs. Florrick?

22:22.940 --> 22:25.602
He is. But those charges
have not been proven yet.

22:25.640 --> 22:26.868
Never accept the premise
of the question.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.707
Your answer can be
edited down to "He is."

22:28.740 --> 22:30.742
Always jump back
to your pivot.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.715
My pivot?
_ Yeah. This is_ the most
Important adVIce I'm ever

22:33.750 --> 22:35.877
gonna give you, Alicia.
Questions are for dopes.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.911
(chuckles)
They are?
Yes. Say it.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.378
Questions are for dopes.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.853
Isn't that the point
of an interview?
No, the point of an interview

22:45.890 --> 22:49.098
is to put you on the
spot, and your point is to
pivot back to your message.

22:49.130 --> 22:51.792
And what is my message?
Castro is ruining
the department.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.038
Now, Mrs. Florrick,
your law partner

22:55.070 --> 22:56.890
is facing drug
conspiracy charges.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.932
Why shouldn't voters trust you
based on who you associate with?

22:59.970 --> 23:03.645
Because my partner is innocent
and the current state's attorney

23:03.680 --> 23:06.148
is pursuing a vendetta
against him to get back at me.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.842
Good. Stick with it--
message discipline. Um,

23:08.880 --> 23:10.814
but doesn't your law firm
also represent Lemond Bishop,

23:10.850 --> 23:12.613
the biggest drug
dealer in Chicago?
Alleged

23:12.650 --> 23:15.517
drug dealer.
Come on, Alicia--
Lemond Bishop.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.051
In our legal system, everyone

23:18.090 --> 23:20.058
deserves a vigorous defense.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.557
But not everyone deserves you.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.795
Unlike the current
state's attorney,

23:23.830 --> 23:26.663
I've seen both sides
of the courtroom.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.589
I know how and when
the system is abused.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.801
Good. Um, don't cross
your legs under the table.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.705
Why?

23:33.740 --> 23:34.729
Well, it keeps you from
sitting up straight.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.133
So cross at the ankles.

23:36.180 --> 23:38.876
Now, let's talk
about the abortion

23:38.910 --> 23:41.617
your son got for his
underage girlfriend.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.716
Is anything wrong,
Mrs. Florrick?

23:47.020 --> 23:48.908
Is this you talking, or Prady?
Prady.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.019
And always use his
first name-- Frank.

23:51.060 --> 23:54.848
Well, Frank,

23:54.900 --> 23:58.597
I obviously find this situation
very difficult.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.632
My son...

24:01.700 --> 24:02.962
No.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.661
You want my real answer?

24:04.710 --> 24:05.608
Sure.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.608
How dare you?

24:07.640 --> 24:09.505
How in the world
does it possibly

24:09.540 --> 24:11.804
impact my work as a prosecutor

24:11.850 --> 24:14.239
to ask about my family's
most vulnerable moments?

24:14.280 --> 24:15.918
Well, it's...
This city is suffering
from the worst

24:15.950 --> 24:18.089
murder spree in its history,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.657
and you're asking me
about my son's abortion?

24:20.690 --> 24:21.952
Are you frigging kidding me?

24:21.990 --> 24:24.629
Okay. Let's unpack that.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.753
Good second half, though I'm
not sure about "frigging."

24:26.790 --> 24:28.724
And bad first half.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.160
You can't personalize it,
Alicia. It's not Frank.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.794
Well, if he asks about Zach,
then it is about Frank.
Well,

24:33.840 --> 24:35.637
the passion is good, you just
have to control it. People don't

24:35.670 --> 24:37.763
necessarily hear the words,
but they get a sense of it from

24:37.810 --> 24:39.562
your tone of voice
and your arm movements.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.134
So try to keep them in check.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.740
Gotcha.
Okay.

24:43.780 --> 24:45.042
Have you heard these rumors
that your husband

24:45.080 --> 24:46.547
is sleeping with an intern

24:46.580 --> 24:48.571
in the governor's
office?

24:52.750 --> 24:55.810
Again, this type
of politics of personal

24:55.860 --> 24:56.849
destruction...
Clich.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.720
Again, this type of...
horse...

25:00.760 --> 25:05.129
Yeah, you can't...
This kind of BS. is why
people don't run for office.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.865
It's why I almost didn't run.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.731
And then I realized if I didn't,

25:08.770 --> 25:11.807
only people like Castro would.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.729
Good, good. And don't
look at the camera.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.806
Act as if it's just the two
of you talking. And watch
out for the second camera.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.205
Sometimes, in the middle of
a question, they'll cut to you
and try to catch you off guard.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.912
And don't be afraid _to
say "I don't agree With
your characterization."

25:22.950 --> 25:24.713
Okay.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.741
Anything else?

25:26.790 --> 25:28.052
Am I ready?

25:28.090 --> 25:29.216
For now.

25:29.260 --> 25:33.082
You're a bundle of optimism.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.224
Your Honor, Cary Agos
was only following the orders

25:36.260 --> 25:38.865
of his superior,
Peter Florrick,

25:38.900 --> 25:40.595
who was state's attorney
at that time.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.993
That's why we
subpoenaed him.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.962
That he is governor
is immaterial.

25:44.010 --> 25:47.878
We're only interested in his
actions as the state's attorney.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.644
Counselor.
Yeah?

25:52.680 --> 25:55.740
It's customary at this point
for you to say something.

25:55.780 --> 25:57.884
If the governor's counsel
is arguing

25:57.920 --> 26:00.184
that Peter Florrick
held some sort of privilege...
I'm not.

26:00.220 --> 26:03.053
Or even had
qualified immunity...
I'm not saying that, either.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.751
GLA'I'I':
Well, then, what are you saying?

26:04.790 --> 26:06.985
Anyone? ASA Polmar?

26:07.030 --> 26:10.864
Qualified immunity
doesn't apply here.
A little louder.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.265
Just spill it out.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.291
(clears throat)

26:17.140 --> 26:19.199
Your Honor. Sir.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.732
Ms. Lockhart is desperate
to make this hearing about

26:22.780 --> 26:24.748
Governor Florri_ck's
refusal to testify.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.247
I'm not desperate
about anything.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.748
She wants me
to put up some shield--

26:28.780 --> 26:31.089
privilege, immunity-- so that
when he doesn't take the stand,

26:31.120 --> 26:33.918
you can draw a negative
inference from that fact.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.918
The defense has to prove
Governor Florrick

26:36.960 --> 26:40.851
can offer some testimony that
would impact her client's guilt.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.198
But he can't.

26:43.230 --> 26:46.199
Mr. Agos isn't being accused
of transporting drugs

26:46.230 --> 26:48.767
against police regulations.
He's being accused

26:48.800 --> 26:50.199
of stealing drugs.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.764
DIANE: I must prove one...
RAMONA: And even the defense

26:51.810 --> 26:53.232
isn't accusing
the governor

26:53.270 --> 26:55.409
of ordering Mr. Agos
to steal these drugs,

26:55.440 --> 26:59.706
so, again: my client
has nothing to contribute here.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.911
Accordingly,
we respectfully submit

27:01.950 --> 27:03.315
the subpoena be quashed.
Immediately.

27:03.350 --> 27:07.912
And, Your Honor, we...
respectfully disagree.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.329
Proof of other crimes presented
during trial could have

27:13.360 --> 27:16.659
an enormous negative impact
on a defendant.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.066
Accordingly, the defendant
deserves every opportunity

27:19.100 --> 27:21.068
_to have such
eVIdence excluded.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.398
In this instance,
however,

27:23.440 --> 27:26.204
I cannot compel
the testimony of a witness,

27:26.240 --> 27:27.730
let alone a sitting governor.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.975
The motion to quash is granted.

27:30.010 --> 27:31.807
Prosecution has
leave to introduce

27:31.850 --> 27:33.715
evidence of
Mr. Agos' involvement

27:33.750 --> 27:36.139
in the disappearance of
the cocaine at trial.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.886
That's it.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.809
(gavelbangs)
You can go. Next.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.680
Well done.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.426
(exhales)

27:59.410 --> 28:01.230
Okay, they said,
uh, 20 more seconds.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.077
Uh, they'll
introduce you in DC,

28:03.110 --> 28:05.374
so you won't
hear that here.

28:07.110 --> 28:09.010
Okay, here we go.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.816
That's right, Jim.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.351
First the husband,
now the wife.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.157
I can always ask her.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.929
Where do you find
the time, Alicia?

28:23.970 --> 28:26.859
The time?
Yes, you-you

28:26.900 --> 28:29.789
started your own law firm,
you have responsibilities

28:29.840 --> 28:32.502
that come with your husband's
job, there's family, and now

28:32.540 --> 28:34.371
you're running for
state's attorney.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.901
Well... yes.

28:38.380 --> 28:39.938
Um, how do you prioritize?

28:39.980 --> 28:42.517
Family first, of course.
Okay,

28:42.550 --> 28:44.882
let's start with your family.
Oh, no,

28:44.920 --> 28:46.182
um, what I was going to say,

28:46.220 --> 28:48.916
is like most busy people,
I triage.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.418
How-How do your, uh, how
do your husband and kids

28:52.460 --> 28:55.190
feel about you taking
on this SA race?

28:55.230 --> 28:57.095
Fine.

28:57.130 --> 28:59.428
Peter, uh, has done the job,

28:59.470 --> 29:02.098
so he's been really helpful.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.529
And my children, growing up
in this family,

29:04.570 --> 29:08.529
understand how important
it is to do public service.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.969
Is that something you
talk about explicitly,

29:11.010 --> 29:13.171
sitting around the dinner
table, or is it a lesson

29:13.210 --> 29:16.111
they get by Florrick
family osmosis?

29:16.150 --> 29:19.881
We have, uh, dinner together,

29:19.920 --> 29:21.808
like other families. We talk.
Oh, I'm sure.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.021
1-1 was just interested...

29:24.060 --> 29:27.996
if you like to sit down and
discuss criminal justice

29:28.030 --> 29:31.158
over the chicken, or
gab about reality TV.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.997
I don't watch reality TV.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.965
Or-Or whatever. My dad
was a police officer,

29:36.000 --> 29:37.865
uh, which I thought
was fascinating,

29:37.910 --> 29:40.401
but he never wanted
to talk about that at home.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.079
For him, it was all
Chicago Bears, all the time.

29:43.110 --> 29:45.340
(laughs)

29:45.380 --> 29:48.417
What the hell?
She's braced for hardball.
She'll relax into it.

29:48.450 --> 29:52.341
One challenge in being a
prosecutor and a mom, I imagine,

29:52.390 --> 29:55.553
will be seeing the absolute
worst side of the world

29:55.590 --> 29:57.512
you're sending your kids into.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.050
Does that worry you?

29:59.090 --> 30:02.389
To the contrary, I think
it will help me remember

30:02.430 --> 30:05.593
what's at stake every time
we try an accused criminal.

30:05.630 --> 30:08.269
_ Hmm.
Something that the current

30:08.300 --> 30:10.962
state's attorney
is failing to do.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.898
Okay.

30:12.940 --> 30:15.534
Is that part of the logic
of your campaign?

30:15.580 --> 30:19.004
Replacing the-the
prosecutor machismo

30:19.050 --> 30:21.075
with the perspective of someone

30:21.120 --> 30:24.385
who's spent the majority
of her life raising kids?

30:25.920 --> 30:27.444
I'm sorry,

30:27.490 --> 30:29.617
I disagree with your
characterization of me as

30:29.660 --> 30:32.049
someone who spent the majority
of her life raising kids.

30:32.090 --> 30:35.423
Oh, I apologize.
I-I didn't mean it as an insult.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.927
ALICIA:
Oh, no, uh, there's no

30:36.960 --> 30:39.428
need... to apologize. Um...

30:39.470 --> 30:42.291
I'm proud of being a mother.

30:42.340 --> 30:46.367
I just... I've done
a lot of other things.

30:46.410 --> 30:48.537
Oh, God, oh, God.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.400
It's okay. It's okay, we
can move on from this.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.601
It was like
watching a ship go down.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.208
And I couldn't
do anything about it.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.912
It was like my-my mouth
was on automatic pilot.

30:56.950 --> 30:58.486
He Katie Couric-ed you.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.909
You think it was planned?
Serving up softballs?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.359
If she answers them earnestly,
she looks like a lightweight.

31:02.390 --> 31:04.255
If she doesn't answer them,
she looks like a prig?

31:04.290 --> 31:05.484
I need something to drink.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.282
Wait, we have something
to tell you.

31:07.330 --> 31:09.218
I did
some intel.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.160
Prady is running.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.135
How do you know?
I talked to a friend
in Warren Plep's office.

31:14.170 --> 31:15.592
They're gathering
signatures for a Prady run.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.528
And they're doing polling.
Then we're sunk.

31:17.570 --> 31:19.606
No, no, not yet.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.676
There's always a plan "B."

31:21.710 --> 31:23.678
We dirty him up. Fast.

31:23.710 --> 31:25.507
We scare him into
not running.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.676
With what?

31:26.710 --> 31:28.143
Well, leave that to us.

31:28.180 --> 31:31.149
Okay.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.283
I'm going home to get drunk.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.208
That's a joke, right?

31:35.260 --> 31:37.057
It is. I know.

31:37.090 --> 31:39.422
Don't joke.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.519
(doorbell rings)

31:41.560 --> 31:44.097
Yeah?

31:44.130 --> 31:46.189
Your bank account balance...

31:46.230 --> 31:48.562
Okay. Who are you?

31:48.600 --> 31:50.431
I'm Kalinda Sharma.

31:50.470 --> 31:51.937
You work at the crime lab.

31:51.970 --> 31:54.370
And that is
your bank account balance.

31:54.410 --> 31:58.073
And as you can see, you received
$30,000 six months ago...

31:58.110 --> 32:01.443
I'm going to go to the police
unless you answer my questions.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.448
What questions?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.186
Well, this $30,000
couldn't have come

32:05.220 --> 32:08.314
from your salary at
the crime lab, so who paid you?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.316
I won the money.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.282
Oh. How?

32:12.330 --> 32:13.649
At a riverboat casino.

32:13.690 --> 32:16.295
Oh. Which one?

32:16.330 --> 32:20.118
Tell me the truth, Liana,
or this is gonna get worse.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.332
I never did anything
like that before.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.509
Like what? _
It was my cousm.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.007
He knew the drugs were
coming through there,

32:28.040 --> 32:29.302
and he wanted them back.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.171
Who's your cousin?
I can't tell you that.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.609
You want to take the fall
for this yourself?

32:32.650 --> 32:34.675
I don't know where he is.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.178
He took off because he was
scared of Lemond Bishop.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.609
Tell me his name?

32:43.490 --> 32:46.459
(sighs)

32:46.490 --> 32:48.697
Trey Wagner.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.463
Where is he?
I don't know.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.365
(phone ringing)
I got to go.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.698
Look, do you stay
in touch with him?
No. Good-bye.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.499
*

33:40.480 --> 33:43.119
"Gary, Indiana."

34:01.840 --> 34:03.489
Hello, Trey.

34:03.540 --> 34:04.768
Ah...
No.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.062
I'm not here for Bishop.

34:07.110 --> 34:09.135
Lady, whenever I meet
you, there's trouble.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.603
Then let's talk.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.512
"Sovereignty for Me,
Not for Thee."

34:18.550 --> 34:20.188
JOHNNY:
It's a Law
Review article

34:20.220 --> 34:21.778
Frank Prady wrote
as a student.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.151
It's about how Israeli
settlements in the West Bank

34:23.190 --> 34:25.226
violate the Geneva
Convention.
Really?

34:25.260 --> 34:26.352
It'll kill him
with Jewish voters.
And

34:26.390 --> 34:27.823
evangelical
Christians.
No.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.328
No, he's right. The evangelicals
will be turned off, too.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.328
No, we're not using this.
Why?

34:32.370 --> 34:35.589
Because we don't even know
if he still believes this.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.665
What does that matter?
Because it does.

34:37.700 --> 34:40.339
And it has nothing to do with
the state's attorney's race.
Alicia,

34:40.370 --> 34:41.769
part of running is
about electability.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.175
Attitude toward Israel
goes to electability.

34:43.210 --> 34:44.541
We're not getting
involved with this.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.172
She's right.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.541
Let's have the PAC do it.
No.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.411
We're not giving it to the PAC.

34:49.450 --> 34:51.179
We are not using it.

34:51.220 --> 34:53.586
Look”.

34:53.620 --> 34:56.851
I'm learning a lot
from you guys,

34:56.890 --> 34:58.619
but you need to learn something
from me, too.

34:58.660 --> 35:01.458
He'll run, you'll lose.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.127
Maybe.

35:06.870 --> 35:08.758
(door closes)

35:08.800 --> 35:11.360
What do you think? You
know her better than I do.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.809
We can't use it.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.173
We can't slip it
to the PAC, either.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.269
There might be another way.

35:18.310 --> 35:20.699
(phone ringing)

35:23.180 --> 35:25.319
Finn Polmar.

35:25.350 --> 35:26.783
_KALINDA:
You're looking for Trey Wagner?

35:26.820 --> 35:29.152
I might be.
Who am I talking to?

35:29.190 --> 35:30.657
Ifound him.

35:30.690 --> 35:32.180
He might be willing to testify.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.822
Against Cary Agos?

35:33.860 --> 35:35.327
No. Lemond Bishop.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.828
(snaps his fingers)

35:37.860 --> 35:39.225
Get Castro now.

35:39.270 --> 35:43.161
Why would he, um,
testify against Bishop?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.509
For two reasons.

35:45.540 --> 35:49.169
He feels guilty about
framing Cary Agos,
who did nothing wrong.

35:49.210 --> 35:50.802
Well, how exactly
did he frame Cary?

35:50.840 --> 35:52.569
He turned the recording on

35:52.610 --> 35:54.578
only for what the cops
wanted to hear.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.848
Okay, and what's
the second reason?

35:55.880 --> 35:57.939
You're going
to grant him immunity?

35:57.980 --> 35:59.618
And you don't want
to tell me your name?

35:59.650 --> 36:01.254
I'm only interested in justice.

36:01.290 --> 36:04.282
Agos is innocent,
Bishop is guilty.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.957
Where are you right now?

36:05.990 --> 36:09.756
I'm with Trey.
You want to talk to him?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.927
Yes, I would.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.428
Trey, you're on.

36:17.770 --> 36:19.761
So, we need to offer Wagner

36:19.810 --> 36:21.402
immunity and
protection, and then

36:21.440 --> 36:22.930
he'll testify
against Bishop.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.949
I thought he was
giving us Cary Agos.
Well,

36:25.980 --> 36:27.777
he said Agos
didn't do anything.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.744
You know, he only
offered us the lavwer

36:29.780 --> 36:31.680
because he was afraid
of turning on Bishop.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.257
But now
he's turning on Bishop.
Well,

36:34.290 --> 36:36.281
his sister's Christian. She's
convinced him to come clean.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.912
Okay, but can he connect Bishop

36:37.960 --> 36:39.985
to the $1.3 million in heroin?

36:40.030 --> 36:41.952
No, no, no,
he said that was his.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.922
He and a few other crew members
were selling that on their own.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.929
But he can connect Bishop
to other drug deliveries.

36:46.970 --> 36:48.665
He can connect them
the way he connected Agos?

36:48.700 --> 36:50.463
Well, he's turning on his boss.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.639
No, he's admitting
that he lied about Agos.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.979
Why do we trust him now?
Because we want Bishop.

36:55.010 --> 36:57.877
Yes. We want Agos
to get us to Bishop.

36:57.910 --> 37:00.378
That's the strategy.
That should continue.
Cary Agos is innocent.

37:00.410 --> 37:02.241
No, Trey says
that he's innocent.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.589
Maybe he's lying to us now.

37:04.620 --> 37:07.441
What's going on, Jim?

37:07.490 --> 37:09.913
Nothing. I think we should stick
to the original strategy.

37:19.670 --> 37:22.298
I think you should reconsider
what you just said.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.734
You don't care about Bishop.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.272
You care about Alicia Florrick.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.308
Get out of my office.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.048
You're kidding me.

37:43.090 --> 37:45.058
Nope.

37:45.090 --> 37:47.524
VVhen?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.995
Roughly four hours ago.

37:53.370 --> 37:55.065
Oh, my God.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.534
Ithought
I was having a weird day.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.333
Why? What was your day?

37:59.370 --> 38:01.838
No, no, no, no, no,
we're gonna stick with you.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.336
What...? Why?

38:03.380 --> 38:04.870
(sighs)

38:04.910 --> 38:07.049
I was disagreeing with
Castro about trial strategy.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.969
On Cary's case?
Can't tell you.

38:10.020 --> 38:13.717
I can't. I resigned, but
it's still confidential.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.856
I think you will tell me
after three more drinks.

38:16.890 --> 38:18.357
Maybe.

38:18.390 --> 38:20.688
(laughing)

38:20.730 --> 38:23.358
Wow. So, what are you gonna do?

38:23.400 --> 38:25.766
Make some money.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.529
Open my own practice.

38:27.570 --> 38:30.698
Do you have office space?

38:30.740 --> 38:32.367
No.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.968
No. I'll probably
go looking tomorrow.

38:34.010 --> 38:37.002
I may have something.
Office space. Where?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.679
The 27th floor of our building.
We're renting it out.

38:39.710 --> 38:42.076
I don't know.
It's a little bit incestuous.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.610
If we were siblings.
(laughs)

38:43.650 --> 38:46.949
I can get you a deal.
I'll think about it.

38:46.990 --> 38:49.311
So, how was your day?

38:50.820 --> 38:53.084
Well...

38:57.130 --> 39:02.033
Let me be clear.
I am pro-Israel and proud of it.

39:02.070 --> 39:05.858
So I have to disagree vehemently
with anyone who still harbors

39:05.910 --> 39:07.537
a youthful fascination
with the Palestinian cause...

39:07.570 --> 39:09.629
Got to be kidding me.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.671
REPORTER (on TV):
SA Castro made these remarks
earlier today in response...

39:11.710 --> 39:12.847
Did you see this?

39:12.880 --> 39:14.438
Yeah. I'm watching it now.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.674
I told you not
to leak that article.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.039
Alicia, I didn't.
Castro did.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.547
And you expect me
to believe that?

39:18.590 --> 39:19.682
Look, we all do
the same searches,

39:19.720 --> 39:21.039
we all find the same dirt.

39:21.090 --> 39:22.717
This is a good thing.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.751
This hurts Prady
without reflecting on you.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.678
...for the Palestinian cause...

39:26.730 --> 39:29.028
You saw the news?
I did.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.597
So, what do we do now?
Well, I don't know
if there's anything to do.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.064
I have to find out if this was
Elfman, or if Eli pushed him.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.761
What are you talking about?

39:35.800 --> 39:37.734
The leak of Prady's
anti-Israel article.

39:37.770 --> 39:41.729
No. Trey Wagner died
in a car accident last night,

39:41.780 --> 39:43.099
along with his cousin--

39:43.140 --> 39:45.005
the two people
who could help

39:45.050 --> 39:46.745
Cary and harm Bishop.

39:46.780 --> 39:48.475
We're going to meet
the new prosecutor now.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.817
I am so sorry.

39:59.890 --> 40:02.199
Good luck.

40:02.230 --> 40:05.119
(phone ringing)

40:08.670 --> 40:09.864
Yes?

40:09.900 --> 40:11.663
RECEPTIONIST:
Frank Prady is here for you.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.507
Excuse me?

40:13.540 --> 40:15.428
Frank Prady. He knows
he doesn't have an appointment,

40:15.480 --> 40:16.902
but he asked
if you have ten minutes.

40:16.940 --> 40:19.079
I... O-Okay.

40:19.110 --> 40:21.670
Hold on one second.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.186
You know what? Just send him...
send him back.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.827
(clears throat)

40:39.870 --> 40:41.690
Oh. Mr. Prady.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.230
How are you?

40:43.270 --> 40:45.238
Uh,ﬁne.

40:45.270 --> 40:48.535
Uh, no, actually, not fine.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.140
Oh. I'm sorry. Why is that? Can
I get you something to drink?

40:51.180 --> 40:55.514
No. No. Uh... I've been
losing friends this morning.

40:55.550 --> 40:58.815
Why?
This article.
This, uh,

40:58.850 --> 41:00.511
thought project
from a while back--

41:00.550 --> 41:02.017
uh, it's been sent
to the press...

41:02.060 --> 41:03.709
CASTRO:
Let me be clear.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.126
I am pro-Israel.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.893
Yes, I, uh... I saw it.

41:11.930 --> 41:15.161
I don't like losing friends.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.634
I don't either.

41:17.670 --> 41:21.037
Uh, you asked me to endorse you.

41:21.070 --> 41:24.107
Yes, I would love
your endorsement.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.699
I'm disgusted

41:27.750 --> 41:30.048
by the personal nature
of politics.

41:30.080 --> 41:34.779
I hate campaigns being treated
like bad reality shows.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.754
How lives are exposed,

41:36.790 --> 41:38.883
and human beings treated like...

41:38.930 --> 41:41.182
commodities.

41:41.230 --> 41:43.790
Yeah. I hate it, too.

41:43.830 --> 41:45.718
So...

41:45.770 --> 41:48.125
I've decided to run
for state's attorney.

41:48.170 --> 41:52.903
The only way to change it
is to have skin in the game.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.805
So I can't endorse you.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.569
Uh, I have resigned from CBS.

41:56.610 --> 41:57.929
Uh, I intend to
run by petition.

41:57.980 --> 41:59.845
You could have called me
to say that.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.745
Yes, I could have,

42:01.780 --> 42:03.941
_ but I wanted
to give you my reasons.

42:03.980 --> 42:07.143
This-this leak of my youthful
views has changed my mind.

42:08.590 --> 42:10.785
You're such a hypocrite.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.885
Excuse me?

42:13.930 --> 42:15.898
You've known for days now
that you are running.

42:15.930 --> 42:18.819
You had me jumping through hoops
for your endorsement

42:18.870 --> 42:20.292
when you knew.

42:20.330 --> 42:21.934
You had Warren Plep out there

42:21.970 --> 42:23.961
getting you signatures,
doing your polling.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.002
So don't act like you're trying
to change the system.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.928
You are the system.

42:27.970 --> 42:30.575
Plep was doing that on his own.
He was the one pitching me.

42:30.610 --> 42:31.872
I think we're done here,
Mr. Prady.

42:31.910 --> 42:33.207
I didn't decide to run

42:33.250 --> 42:34.774
until this leak today.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.948
Eli, he's running.
He's in my office.

42:37.980 --> 42:39.982
I intended to support you
until I discovered

42:40.020 --> 42:42.784
it was your team
that gave my article to Castro.

42:42.820 --> 42:44.981
Is there something else
you need, Mr. Prady?

42:47.230 --> 42:49.323
No.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.157
Good luck, Mrs. Florrick.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.919
Yup, it was fun.
See you out there.
