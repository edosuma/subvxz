Didn't come out here
to play games!

00:45.565 --> 00:47.867
Bus is leaving
in 5 minutes.

00:47.918 --> 00:51.287
Get your gear
or it stays.

00:54.675 --> 00:58.094
You're out here
6 days, boys.

00:58.178 --> 01:00.513
Had a chance
to prove yourselves.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.431
And what have you done?

01:02.516 --> 01:06.418
Showed me you're a bunch
of lazy sons of bitches.

01:06.470 --> 01:09.021
[Insects buzzing]

01:46.393 --> 01:48.260
I got your message.

01:48.312 --> 01:50.763
Good. What do you think?

01:50.814 --> 01:53.232
It presents
as mass suicide.

01:53.299 --> 01:54.984
Can you prove it?

01:55.068 --> 01:56.936
Not without visiting
the campus.

01:56.987 --> 01:58.321
[Sighs]

01:58.405 --> 02:00.106
That's what I thought.

02:00.157 --> 02:02.474
I can't make an assessment without
meeting the faculty and students.

02:02.526 --> 02:04.610
I know. It--

02:04.661 --> 02:07.613
the school is up for
the federal Tomlinson grant.

02:07.664 --> 02:09.832
This does not bode well.

02:09.916 --> 02:12.752
The director's a graduate
of Somerville Academy, isn't he?

02:12.819 --> 02:15.421
Yes. And he's been fighting
for the government funding.

02:15.488 --> 02:17.757
These boys killed themselves
for a reason.

02:17.824 --> 02:19.759
No one should write that off.

02:19.826 --> 02:23.045
I'm not asking you to.

02:24.348 --> 02:26.999
Somerville Military Academy,
Oceanside, Florida,

02:27.050 --> 02:29.468
5 boys were found hanging
this morning.

02:29.519 --> 02:31.971
The bodies are at the
medical examiner's now.

02:32.055 --> 02:33.305
There's no photos?

02:33.357 --> 02:35.691
School personnel thought
they may still be alive,

02:35.776 --> 02:37.343
so they cut them
out of the trees.

02:37.411 --> 02:39.278
Hotch: Jimmy Burbage,
Phil Mumford,

02:39.345 --> 02:41.814
Jerry Bowden, Jack Briggs,
Tucker Calhoun.

02:41.865 --> 02:44.650
Morgan: So we're walking into
a contaminated crime scene.

02:44.718 --> 02:46.018
We don't have
anything solid?

02:46.069 --> 02:48.487
"We're sorry" was carved
in a tree branch nearby.

02:48.538 --> 02:49.822
This happened on campus?

02:49.873 --> 02:51.356
No, in the woods
about an hour away.

02:51.408 --> 02:52.491
How long were they
out there?

02:52.542 --> 02:53.492
6 days.

02:53.543 --> 02:54.827
Without supervision?

02:54.878 --> 02:57.463
It was an outward bound mission
for the upperclassmen.

02:57.530 --> 02:58.998
What drove them to suicide?

02:59.049 --> 03:00.499
A freshman cadet,
Bailey Shelton,

03:00.550 --> 03:03.169
hung himself 2 weeks ago
in his room.

03:03.220 --> 03:04.754
Identical bed sheet,
hangman's knot.

03:04.838 --> 03:06.422
Who takes sheets
camping?

03:06.506 --> 03:08.140
They would
if it was the plan.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.642
Could be domino effect.

03:09.709 --> 03:12.311
The campus would have been on
high alert after the first one,

03:12.378 --> 03:14.397
so the kids wait until they're
alone in the woods.

03:14.481 --> 03:16.232
They must have made
some kind of pact.

03:16.316 --> 03:18.458
And there's something else.
6 kids went on the trip.

03:18.483 --> 03:19.683
Only 5 were found.

03:20.020 --> 03:22.655
Strauss: The school officials confirm
that Josh Redding is still missing.

03:22.723 --> 03:24.356
Morgan: So maybe he
chickened out of the pact.

03:24.424 --> 03:25.775
Or was never a part of it.

03:25.859 --> 03:27.634
And the campus is
completely off the grid.

03:27.659 --> 03:28.560
No Internet.

03:28.561 --> 03:29.945
I can help with that.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.447
Which is why you're
coming with us.

03:31.531 --> 03:32.998
- Oh.
- And so am I.

03:33.066 --> 03:36.168
Isn't Somerville
the director's alma mater?

03:36.236 --> 03:39.789
Yes. The academy has enjoyed
a spotless reputation,

03:39.873 --> 03:43.642
so the hope is to keep
the investigation in house.

03:44.761 --> 03:46.629
I imagine there's
a lot of concern for Josh.

03:46.713 --> 03:48.798
He's been in those woods
almost a week.

03:48.882 --> 03:50.582
So how's he surviving?

04:46.172 --> 04:49.090
There's still no sign
of Josh Redding.

04:49.141 --> 04:50.792
We'll join the search.

04:50.843 --> 04:52.627
So, the Somerville Academy
was founded

04:52.678 --> 04:53.812
during World War II.

04:53.896 --> 04:55.680
It is hard-core old school.

04:55.765 --> 04:57.265
They don't even have
a website.

04:57.316 --> 04:59.901
Socioeconomic breakdown's
all over the map.

04:59.968 --> 05:01.569
Yeah, so are the ages.

05:01.637 --> 05:03.571
Students are
12 to 18 years old,

05:03.639 --> 05:05.807
on the same campus,
in the same dorms.

05:05.858 --> 05:07.742
Same personnel has worked
there for a lifetime.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.911
Ron Massey has been
superintendent for 30 years.

05:09.978 --> 05:12.747
He's an alum, as is the
majority of the staff there.

05:12.815 --> 05:14.916
Lieutenant Tawes has been
his second in command

05:14.983 --> 05:16.084
this whole time.

05:16.151 --> 05:17.919
These type of places
have their own infrastructure.

05:17.986 --> 05:19.587
If it ain't broken,
they ain't gonna fix it.

05:19.655 --> 05:22.090
That's probably why
they banned modern technology.

05:22.157 --> 05:24.125
They didn't need it back then,
they don't need it now.

05:24.176 --> 05:25.827
Aggressive motto--

05:25.878 --> 05:27.712
"vivere est vincere."

05:27.797 --> 05:29.714
To live is to conquer.

05:29.799 --> 05:31.549
The school raises soldiers.

05:31.634 --> 05:32.834
Suicide is not
part of that mantra.

05:32.885 --> 05:35.503
Reid: Bailey Shelton
was only 13 years old.

05:35.554 --> 05:37.222
He was one of the youngest
students there.

05:37.306 --> 05:40.392
His death is probably
the key to the others.

06:05.634 --> 06:07.201
Colonel Massey,

06:07.253 --> 06:08.253
Erin Strauss.

06:08.337 --> 06:10.672
This is the team
I spoke with you about.

06:10.723 --> 06:11.723
Agent Hotchner.

06:11.807 --> 06:14.008
This is Agent Morgan,
Agent Jareau,

06:14.060 --> 06:16.227
Dr. Spencer Reid,
and Penelope Garcia.

06:16.312 --> 06:18.980
So shouldn't the flag
be at half-mast?

06:19.047 --> 06:20.682
I haven't told the boys yet.

06:20.733 --> 06:21.900
Do they know
who we are?

06:21.984 --> 06:23.818
I'll tell them
when the time is right.

06:23.886 --> 06:25.008
I've called all of the parents.

06:25.033 --> 06:27.007
They're driving from
up and down the East Coast.

06:27.573 --> 06:29.357
In fact, Josh Redding's
have just arrived.

06:29.408 --> 06:30.742
I'd like to speak
with them.

06:30.810 --> 06:32.861
- They're in the chapel.
- How are they?

06:32.912 --> 06:34.112
As you'd expect.

06:34.196 --> 06:36.114
All right, I'll get started.

06:36.198 --> 06:38.416
Cadet.

06:39.502 --> 06:41.186
Any leads on Josh?

06:41.253 --> 06:42.420
In that terrain,

06:42.488 --> 06:44.422
he's only capable
of moving a mile an hour.

06:44.507 --> 06:46.407
Puts him in a 60-mile radius.

06:46.459 --> 06:48.877
That's 3,600 square miles
to cover.

06:48.928 --> 06:51.212
Tawes knows those woods
better than anybody.

06:51.263 --> 06:53.915
We've got two agents meeting and
we'll start the investigation here.

06:53.966 --> 06:56.250
Where's the place
with the most outlets?

06:56.302 --> 06:57.302
Best bet is in the library.

06:57.386 --> 06:58.603
Thank you.

06:58.687 --> 07:00.271
We'd like to start with
Bailey Shelton's suicide.

07:00.356 --> 07:02.724
Do you have a copy of
the medical examiner's report?

07:02.775 --> 07:04.726
I don't.

07:04.777 --> 07:07.695
But there was no question
he hung himself.

07:07.763 --> 07:09.764
Well, the nuances
can tell us a lot.

07:09.815 --> 07:12.534
The doctor's receiving
the last of the bodies now.

07:12.601 --> 07:14.369
I expect he's
got his hands full.

07:14.436 --> 07:15.770
I'll speak to him later.

07:15.821 --> 07:17.038
Of course.

07:17.105 --> 07:18.540
It would be helpful to us

07:18.607 --> 07:20.391
to know what Bailey's
last day was like.

07:20.459 --> 07:21.743
I'll show you.

07:21.794 --> 07:23.561
He stayed
in the plebes hall.

07:23.629 --> 07:25.747
His father took
all of his belongings

07:25.798 --> 07:27.415
after the suicide.

07:27.466 --> 07:30.284
Josh's items
are as they were.

07:30.336 --> 07:32.637
Josh stayed with
the first years?

07:32.721 --> 07:34.088
He's the brigade commander.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.957
Bailey's suicide hit him
hard.

07:36.008 --> 07:38.593
Were all the victims
friends of Bailey's?

07:38.644 --> 07:41.262
Brotherhood is the very
price and condition

07:41.313 --> 07:42.597
of man's survival.

07:42.648 --> 07:44.732
Carlos Romulo.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.771
All of my boys are brothers.

07:49.822 --> 07:53.307
There's Tucker Calhoun's
parents.

07:53.359 --> 07:55.309
Excuse me.

07:55.361 --> 07:58.997
If the boys were so vulnerable,
why did they send them into the woods?

08:02.451 --> 08:05.486
Because it was time
for their survival test.

08:05.538 --> 08:06.754
We have a docket.

08:06.822 --> 08:09.541
It's been only two weeks
since the initial suicide.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.042
You couldn't
postpone this trip?

08:11.110 --> 08:12.210
Classes were canceled

08:12.294 --> 08:13.795
the day after Bailey died.

08:13.846 --> 08:16.047
But men are lost
in battle all the time.

08:16.131 --> 08:19.083
This isn't battle,
and these aren't men.

08:19.151 --> 08:20.718
They are when
they leave here.

08:20.803 --> 08:22.554
How many suicides
have you seen?

08:22.638 --> 08:24.055
Just these.

08:24.139 --> 08:26.224
So part of the mission
was unsupervised?

08:26.308 --> 08:27.392
For a week.

08:27.476 --> 08:29.727
But you came back
6 days later.

08:29.795 --> 08:32.897
Standard procedure to check in
if the weather's extreme.

08:32.965 --> 08:34.899
Had lightning
and thunder last night.

08:34.967 --> 08:37.518
The boys didn't have any way
to communicate with you?

08:37.570 --> 08:39.404
Smoke signal.

08:39.488 --> 08:41.121
Seriously?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.491
Basic survival skills,
ma'am.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.744
We teach them to follow their
instincts, not rely on technology.

08:46.829 --> 08:48.830
No radio, no weapons.

08:48.881 --> 08:50.498
Well, survival courses
like these

08:50.549 --> 08:52.917
often trigger
a fight or flight response.

08:53.002 --> 08:56.087
It looks like that's
what happened to Josh.

08:56.171 --> 08:58.039
Who slept here?

08:58.090 --> 09:00.592
Don't know.
They're all identical.

09:00.676 --> 09:02.527
Whoever was here
took off.

09:02.595 --> 09:04.312
And it's secluded.

09:04.379 --> 09:07.181
Did Josh Redding
isolate himself a lot?

09:07.233 --> 09:08.716
I suppose.

09:08.767 --> 09:09.884
He was a loner.

09:09.935 --> 09:11.385
Prentiss:
And why is that?

09:11.437 --> 09:14.388
He didn't want to be
at Somerville in the first place.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.891
JJ: Why did you
send Josh here?

09:16.942 --> 09:19.861
Because he was getting
into a lot of trouble.

09:19.912 --> 09:22.046
And he was always
angry and...

09:22.114 --> 09:23.281
He was being a teenager.

09:23.349 --> 09:25.232
You were gone, Will.

09:25.284 --> 09:26.784
All the time.

09:28.287 --> 09:30.237
He was nearly 6 feet tall

09:30.289 --> 09:32.540
by the time he was 14.

09:32.591 --> 09:33.925
With a bad temper,

09:34.009 --> 09:36.261
and he was punching
holes in walls,

09:36.345 --> 09:38.763
and he wouldn't listen
to me anymore.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.752
He could be belligerent.

09:44.803 --> 09:46.420
But this--

09:46.472 --> 09:48.106
this was extreme.

09:48.190 --> 09:50.024
Why?

09:50.092 --> 09:52.393
We had to force him.

09:52.444 --> 09:53.928
What are you doing?
Let me go!

09:53.979 --> 09:55.262
We're helping you, Josh.

09:55.314 --> 09:57.565
Mom, dad, please,
don't let them do this!

09:57.616 --> 09:58.933
They're not gonna hurt you.

09:58.984 --> 10:00.101
Dad, please!

10:00.152 --> 10:02.603
I was afraid
he was gonna hurt himself.

10:02.655 --> 10:06.607
Or someone else if we didn't
get him some help.

10:06.659 --> 10:09.744
How was Josh taking
Bailey's suicide?

10:09.795 --> 10:12.330
We only talked once
after that.

10:12.414 --> 10:13.998
Phone calls are
a privilege here.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.616
Was that difficult
for Josh?

10:15.668 --> 10:18.603
Josh has never been
much of a talker,

10:18.671 --> 10:22.140
but I think he felt
a real responsibility for Bailey

10:22.224 --> 10:24.125
and the other boys
in the hall.

10:24.176 --> 10:25.276
Did he ever tell you

10:25.344 --> 10:28.146
why Bailey may have
killed himself?

10:28.230 --> 10:30.798
No.

10:32.184 --> 10:33.901
Mr. Redding.

10:39.858 --> 10:42.660
How are you gonna
get my boy back here?

10:56.175 --> 10:58.409
[Grunting]

11:05.351 --> 11:07.635
These beds are all
3 feet apart

11:07.686 --> 11:09.287
and there's absolutely
no privacy.

11:09.355 --> 11:11.939
How did Bailey hang himself
without anybody noticing?

11:12.007 --> 11:14.341
Apparently
he did it in here.

11:14.393 --> 11:16.778
He used Josh's room?

11:16.845 --> 11:18.279
According to Massey,

11:18.346 --> 11:21.482
Josh offered Bailey
a lot of support.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.101
He told you that?

11:23.168 --> 11:24.819
Yes, when we spoke.

11:24.870 --> 11:26.988
Is that a problem?

11:27.056 --> 11:29.957
Is there anything else
he mentioned?

11:30.025 --> 11:32.660
The boys come in here just to sleep.
It's why it's so minimal.

11:32.711 --> 11:34.962
[Chuckles] Strauss, what, are
you on the board or something?

11:35.030 --> 11:37.465
I just saw the campus
same as you.

11:37.532 --> 11:38.966
It's hardly a prison.

11:39.034 --> 11:43.254
These kids are told what to wear,
what to say, and when to eat.

11:43.338 --> 11:45.973
This goes against the very
nature of these boys.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.043
They're all looking for some type
of control in their lives,

11:49.094 --> 11:51.312
and this place
strips them of that.

11:51.379 --> 11:54.315
And suicide
is the ultimate power?

11:54.382 --> 11:56.434
Isn't it?

11:56.518 --> 11:59.153
Well, at least the boys felt enough
remorse to write "we're sorry."

11:59.221 --> 12:02.156
That doesn't trump
taking your own life.

12:02.224 --> 12:03.808
What is it?

12:03.876 --> 12:06.077
But I guess I can buy
that the other kids

12:06.161 --> 12:08.162
couldn't hear Bailey
hang himself.

12:08.230 --> 12:12.283
Josh was laying right here.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.737
[Sighs]

12:17.840 --> 12:22.160
I've never seen
a mass suicide apology.

12:22.227 --> 12:24.929
Maybe they knew
it would help their parents.

12:25.013 --> 12:27.432
Could be confessing
other sins.

12:27.516 --> 12:29.383
Who was in this tree?

12:29.435 --> 12:31.018
Tucker Calhoun.

12:31.086 --> 12:32.937
Good cadet.

12:33.021 --> 12:36.090
Looks like Josh has doubled
back a few times.

12:36.141 --> 12:37.275
But the dogs
can't find him.

12:37.359 --> 12:38.726
Is he familiar
with these woods?

12:38.777 --> 12:41.428
All first years
come here for a mission.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.732
Josh tried to run away
back then but didn't get far.

12:44.783 --> 12:46.050
None of them do.

12:46.118 --> 12:47.952
But after 3 more years
of training...

12:48.036 --> 12:50.771
He didn't weigh himself down
with supplies.

12:50.823 --> 12:52.740
Smart.

12:52.791 --> 12:54.992
We taught him well.

13:00.415 --> 13:03.050
Colonel, it's been 6 days
since the suicides.

13:03.118 --> 13:05.336
Why hasn't Josh
come back to campus?

13:05.420 --> 13:07.421
He's got trust issues.

13:07.473 --> 13:09.257
I thought
he was doing well.

13:09.308 --> 13:11.225
Too smart for his own good.

13:11.293 --> 13:12.793
The most dangerous kind.

13:12.845 --> 13:14.929
Dangerous to whom?

13:14.980 --> 13:18.632
Himself. Boys like Josh
reject the lessons of men.

13:18.684 --> 13:22.603
His generation has little
respect for their elders.

13:22.654 --> 13:24.305
Does that include you?

13:24.356 --> 13:26.274
We've been working on it.

13:26.325 --> 13:28.693
All the first years
start in the laundry room.

13:28.777 --> 13:31.812
It teaches them
responsibility.

13:35.317 --> 13:37.034
Ten-hut!

13:45.711 --> 13:48.495
Bailey finished his rotation

13:48.547 --> 13:50.798
and walked back to his bunk.

13:50.849 --> 13:53.301
So he was still here
for bed check?

13:53.352 --> 13:54.936
It wasn't the first time.

13:55.003 --> 13:56.637
Was he punished
for being late?

13:56.688 --> 13:59.173
If you're suggesting
that Bailey killed himself

13:59.224 --> 14:02.310
because of a talking to,
that's absurd.

14:02.361 --> 14:04.278
That could depend
on what you said.

14:04.346 --> 14:07.514
He understood
I was disappointed.

14:07.566 --> 14:10.034
Were the victims' bunks made
before they went into the woods?

14:10.118 --> 14:11.869
Each and every morning.

14:11.954 --> 14:14.572
So where did they get the sheets
to hang themselves?

14:20.796 --> 14:22.529
Carry on.

14:28.003 --> 14:31.705
Come on, baby.
Come on.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.141
[Gasps]
Boo!

14:34.209 --> 14:35.259
Jeez, you scared me.

14:35.344 --> 14:36.744
I thought you were a ghost.

14:36.812 --> 14:38.229
You know, older
buildings like this

14:38.313 --> 14:41.215
emit a low enough frequency
that you can't consciously hear.

14:41.266 --> 14:42.600
Because the sensory
overload can't be explained,

14:42.684 --> 14:43.734
it wreaks havoc
with your emotions,

14:43.819 --> 14:46.053
inducing fear, panic,
and dread,

14:46.104 --> 14:47.438
hence the feeling
of being haunted.

14:47.522 --> 14:48.773
What about the visions?

14:48.857 --> 14:51.108
Your eyes overcompensate
for what your ears are missing.

14:51.193 --> 14:52.994
That said, I do know
a 3-year-old boy

14:53.061 --> 14:55.947
that once met a friendly apparition
named Leverett Saltonstall.

14:56.031 --> 14:58.115
- He was nice?
- Very nice.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.334
You'd think the laundry room would
be closer to the dorms.

15:00.402 --> 15:02.036
It's not in the basement?

15:02.087 --> 15:03.871
It's on the opposite
side of campus.

15:03.922 --> 15:05.006
That's so strange.
- Yeah.

15:05.073 --> 15:07.842
Leaves of 3, let them be.

15:07.909 --> 15:10.845
Oh, man. Poison Ivy.
Alcohol swabs, stat.

15:10.912 --> 15:13.580
Thank you. You know,
if I've got it, so do you.

15:13.632 --> 15:15.766
I'm Italian. It knows better.
Where's Massey?

15:15.851 --> 15:18.752
He's meeting with the victims' families.
They're arriving now.

15:18.804 --> 15:20.087
JJ, how are Josh's parents?

15:20.138 --> 15:22.723
Upset. They sent him here to
keep him away from trouble.

15:22.774 --> 15:26.394
Tawes made it seem like these guys
are the only family they have.

15:26.445 --> 15:27.761
You make it sound
like a cult.

15:27.813 --> 15:29.230
Uh, it kind of is.

15:29.281 --> 15:31.198
This is a well-respected
institution.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.566
They're not on trial.

15:32.618 --> 15:34.735
The integral part
of the investigation

15:34.786 --> 15:37.271
is going to be understanding
what these victims lived every day.

15:37.322 --> 15:39.040
And with who.
Bailey Shelton

15:39.107 --> 15:40.741
killed himself
in Josh Redding's room.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.543
Was Josh in the room
that night?

15:42.610 --> 15:44.879
- According to the records.
Garcia: I will dig for dirt.

15:44.946 --> 15:46.547
Hotch: Dave, you find
anything in the woods?

15:46.614 --> 15:48.716
Josh's tent
was secluded.

15:48.783 --> 15:51.052
His things were left behind.
He just took off.

15:51.119 --> 15:53.304
Massey said he never
got any respect from Josh.

15:53.388 --> 15:55.923
And Josh's own parents said
he was impossible to control.

15:55.974 --> 15:58.625
His course load indicates
increased isolation.

15:58.677 --> 16:00.895
Isolated, smart, angry.

16:00.962 --> 16:03.397
That could be
a budding psychopath.

16:03.465 --> 16:04.765
What are you saying?

16:04.833 --> 16:07.034
Josh Redding
killed his classmates?

16:08.970 --> 16:11.355
Then he's not missing.
He's on the run.

16:11.423 --> 16:13.140
And he was been
for a week.

16:13.208 --> 16:14.942
One hell of a head start.

16:14.993 --> 16:17.144
With all the skills
he could ever need.

17:10.191 --> 17:12.298
[Bugle plays]

17:12.300 --> 17:15.152
Stand...A-ten-hut!

17:16.027 --> 17:19.695
Present...Arms!

17:24.035 --> 17:28.222
Order...Arms!

17:29.224 --> 17:31.959
[Indistinct command]

17:34.929 --> 17:38.015
Colonel,
any sign of Josh?

17:38.066 --> 17:39.233
Tawes was out there
all night.

17:39.317 --> 17:41.518
The volunteers have spread
out to the next county.

17:41.569 --> 17:43.153
Where do you think he'd go?

17:43.221 --> 17:44.005
To higher ground.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.855
But we would have
seen him by now.

17:46.157 --> 17:47.476
Sir, you said it was Josh

17:47.501 --> 17:49.408
who found Bailey hanging
in his room, correct?

17:49.911 --> 17:51.411
When he woke up, yes.

17:51.496 --> 17:53.580
You didn't find it to be odd that
Josh could sleep through that?

17:53.665 --> 17:55.499
What are you saying?

17:55.566 --> 17:58.085
Josh is the only person
in common with all these deaths.

17:58.169 --> 18:00.587
You think Josh
killed Bailey?

18:00.672 --> 18:02.572
It's a possibility.

18:03.591 --> 18:05.709
I sent a murderer
into the woods.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.069
Whoever did this
wanted us to find them

18:07.094 --> 18:08.294
just like Bailey Shelton.

18:09.097 --> 18:11.048
Ok, so how did he do it?

18:11.099 --> 18:13.750
How did Josh control
5 strong kids?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.312
Josh supervised the
cadets both in the bunk

18:16.337 --> 18:17.387
and the laundry room.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.589
That could explain
how the sheets got out.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.308
Yeah, so what
does "we're sorry" mean

18:21.392 --> 18:23.026
if it wasn't written
for suicide?

18:23.094 --> 18:25.229
What if Josh wanted them
to apologize for something?

18:25.280 --> 18:28.198
For their sins?
There's no record

18:28.266 --> 18:31.368
of bad behavior, but all of
these guys were Alpha males.

18:31.435 --> 18:34.071
The were all upperclassmen
who might have bullied Bailey.

18:34.122 --> 18:35.971
The message was carved
under Tucker Calhoun's

18:35.996 --> 18:37.196
tree for a reason.

18:37.292 --> 18:39.576
Yeah. We need to know
more about that kid.

18:39.627 --> 18:41.078
What are you looking at?

18:41.129 --> 18:43.714
The M.E.'s report.
Bilateral fracture

18:43.781 --> 18:45.615
of the pars interarticular
of the C2 vertebra.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.917
Uh-huh. What's that?

18:46.968 --> 18:48.585
Classic hangman's
fracture,

18:48.636 --> 18:50.254
but only one of
the 5 victims had it.

18:50.305 --> 18:51.421
Prentiss: Which one?

18:51.472 --> 18:52.756
Tucker Calhoun.

18:52.807 --> 18:54.958
Garcia:
Jeez, who is this guy?

18:55.009 --> 18:57.928
The others suffered rotational fractures,
hanging was secondary.

18:57.979 --> 18:59.563
Staging the crime scene.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.898
Josh is more sophisticated
than we thought.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.183
And vindictive.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.851
He wanted Tucker
to suffer.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.937
The question is why.

19:06.988 --> 19:11.108
Tawes thinks he's
on a rescue mission.

19:11.159 --> 19:12.442
He still is.

19:12.493 --> 19:15.812
We've got an enemy
out there.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.166
Someone who killed
6 of my boys.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.668
We need to figure out why.

19:21.753 --> 19:23.653
We need to start with
everyone who knows Josh.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.006
...March!

19:29.460 --> 19:32.262
No, ma'am,
Josh didn't have friends.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.164
Why is that?

19:34.215 --> 19:36.383
It depends on
who you ask, sir.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.936
What was his relationship
with Tucker Calhoun?

19:40.004 --> 19:43.473
Josh is straight up.
This place never broke him.

19:43.524 --> 19:46.443
No matter
how hard they tried.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.678
Who tried to break him?
Tucker?

19:51.532 --> 19:53.900
A cadet will not lie,
cheat, steal,

19:53.985 --> 19:56.536
or tolerate those who do.

19:56.621 --> 19:58.071
You've got
an honor code.

19:58.156 --> 20:02.192
My guess is not everyone
lives by it.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.197
You do.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.368
Ma'am. Sir.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.390
Right face!

20:17.675 --> 20:20.527
Forward march!

20:20.595 --> 20:23.430
They all gonna be
like that?

20:23.514 --> 20:25.349
Not all of them.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.100
"We shall defend our island,

20:27.185 --> 20:29.152
"whatever the cost may be,

20:29.220 --> 20:31.104
"we shall fight
on the beaches,

20:31.189 --> 20:32.739
"we shall fight
on the landing grounds,

20:32.824 --> 20:35.826
"we shall fight in the fields
and in the streets,

20:35.893 --> 20:37.560
"we shall fight
in the hills,

20:37.612 --> 20:40.497
"we shall never surrender.

20:40.564 --> 20:42.282
"We shall defend our island,

20:42.367 --> 20:44.368
whatever the cost may be."

20:44.419 --> 20:46.703
Why the hell
would Josh hurt them?

20:46.754 --> 20:50.624
Hotch: Has Josh been
more distant this year?

20:50.708 --> 20:53.794
Well, his course load
is extreme.

20:53.878 --> 20:57.130
Did he specifically complain
about anyone to you?

20:57.215 --> 20:59.383
I already told you no.

20:59.434 --> 21:02.585
You said he was frustrated being
saddled with the younger cadets?

21:02.637 --> 21:06.273
That boy Bailey cried himself
to sleep every damn night.

21:06.357 --> 21:10.777
Maybe Josh had
had enough of that.

21:10.862 --> 21:12.762
He met him outside.

21:12.814 --> 21:16.032
Bailey's father couldn't
come into this building.

21:16.100 --> 21:21.771
So Josh folded is clothes,
his towels, everything,

21:21.823 --> 21:23.253
all so that his dad

21:23.278 --> 21:25.419
wouldn't have to walk
past this room.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.107
That's what my son did.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.027
That's who my son is.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.709
Is it true
Josh killed them all?

22:15.793 --> 22:17.961
Do you think he did?

22:18.012 --> 22:19.629
I wouldn't fool with Josh.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.881
You're a smart kid.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.015
He's a big guy.

22:22.099 --> 22:23.683
You ever see him fight?

22:23.768 --> 22:24.935
All the time.

22:25.002 --> 22:26.970
What about Josh
and Tucker Calhoun?

22:27.021 --> 22:28.438
Did they ever
get into it?

22:28.506 --> 22:29.973
Tucker was an ass.

22:30.024 --> 22:32.108
He used to come in here and pee on
the sheets after we washed them.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.343
Did he do that
on the night

22:33.394 --> 22:35.812
that Bailey Shelton
committed suicide?

22:35.863 --> 22:38.281
The bastard did it
every night.

22:38.349 --> 22:41.067
Do you think Josh
wanted to punish those kids

22:41.152 --> 22:42.519
for picking on Bailey?

22:42.570 --> 22:45.121
Sure. But he wasn't supposed
to be on that trip, anyway.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.373
What do you mean?

22:46.457 --> 22:47.741
It's a leadership reward.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.793
You gotta have at least
20 points to go.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.127
But Josh only had 16.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.629
Points?

22:52.696 --> 22:54.214
They're posted.

22:54.298 --> 22:56.333
More points, more rewards.

22:56.384 --> 22:58.301
How many do you have?

22:58.369 --> 22:59.553
Negative 5.

22:59.637 --> 23:01.371
Good luck.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.873
Thanks for the help.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.476
No one told us
about a point system.

23:06.544 --> 23:08.812
So Tucker Calhoun
has the most points.

23:08.879 --> 23:10.397
- Who approves them?
- Massey.

23:10.481 --> 23:12.215
Well, maybe Tucker
was his little pet.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.900
Leader of everything.

23:13.985 --> 23:15.652
That comes with an attitude.

23:15.719 --> 23:17.938
Steamroller types like that, they
don't let anybody get in their way.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.940
Nothing was nice
about that kid.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.325
It sounds like he strong-armed
everybody.

23:22.393 --> 23:24.861
Well, then the points
are for bad behavior,

23:24.912 --> 23:26.162
only they're not
calling it that.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.581
We should
look at the points

23:27.665 --> 23:29.449
of everyone
who died in those woods.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.668
My guess is
they were all bullies.

23:31.735 --> 23:33.203
Except for Josh.

23:41.762 --> 23:44.180
Hotch, is something
going on with Strauss?

23:44.248 --> 23:45.348
Why?

23:45.416 --> 23:47.884
Well, she's awfully
protective of this place.

23:47.935 --> 23:50.353
She's got pressure
from above.

23:50.421 --> 23:53.139
You sure
it's nothing else?

23:53.224 --> 23:54.808
She doesn't like
the field.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.092
Really.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.278
Any word from Josh?

23:58.362 --> 23:59.762
No.

[Knock on door]

24:06.120 --> 24:07.787
Colonel,

24:07.872 --> 24:09.772
we need to speak to
Bailey Shelton's parents.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.741
Well, his mother died
years ago.

24:11.792 --> 24:13.276
I could get hold
of his father.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.612
Do that, please.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.284
What's going on?

24:21.335 --> 24:25.055
Josh had contact with Bailey's
father the day he died.

24:25.122 --> 24:26.890
And you think
he could give you

24:26.957 --> 24:28.425
behavioral clues
about Josh?

24:28.476 --> 24:30.093
It's all we have
right now, Strauss.

24:30.144 --> 24:31.595
The man just
lost his son.

24:31.646 --> 24:34.097
Do you really think he's going
to remember how Josh acted?

24:34.148 --> 24:36.483
By all means, I'm open
to other suggestions.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.801
Massey knows his students
better than anyone.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.270
Why not trust him?

24:40.321 --> 24:42.939
Because all Massey wants right now
is for this to go away.

24:42.990 --> 24:47.143
He'll tell us whatever
he thinks we want to hear.

24:47.194 --> 24:50.280

24:50.331 --> 24:53.950

24:54.001 --> 24:55.619

[Ring]

25:14.749 --> 25:17.301
What the hell was
he doing way out here?

25:17.385 --> 25:20.420
It isn't exactly the kind of place
he'd stumble upon.

25:20.472 --> 25:22.556
Do you think Josh
built this trap?

25:22.607 --> 25:24.308
Right out of
the Somerville handbook.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.193
He even used his poncho
to cover it.

25:26.260 --> 25:28.979
He lured Chris Shelton here.

25:29.064 --> 25:32.599
The body was still warm.
Probably died just a few hours ago.

25:32.650 --> 25:34.151
So Josh couldn't
be far away.

25:34.235 --> 25:37.437
Tawes already took off.
Thinks he can find him.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.041
A little help?

25:41.109 --> 25:45.946
So why would Josh
want Bailey's father dead?

25:45.997 --> 25:47.715
The duffel's from Somerville.

25:47.782 --> 25:50.667
It's got Bailey's
stuff in it--

25:50.752 --> 25:52.002
and these.

25:52.087 --> 25:53.804
Bed sheets.

25:53.888 --> 25:57.958
He's the one
who hung those boys.

26:08.353 --> 26:11.471
Ok, so he blamed them

26:11.523 --> 26:12.940
for bullying his son,

26:12.991 --> 26:15.275
and Josh escaped.

26:15.326 --> 26:17.611
Josh wasn't supposed
to be out here in the first place.

26:17.679 --> 26:20.080
This trap was
to protect himself.

26:20.148 --> 26:22.716
But this place
isn't on any map.

26:22.784 --> 26:24.818
How did Bailey's dad
find it?

26:24.869 --> 26:27.671
Somebody tipped him off.

26:52.847 --> 26:56.349
I make a promise
to watch after these boys.

26:56.401 --> 26:59.019
In many ways they're my own.

26:59.070 --> 27:02.189
Then something like this
happens.

27:05.543 --> 27:07.494
Colonel, so you're saying
Josh was in his room

27:07.562 --> 27:09.496
the night that Bailey
hung himself?

27:09.547 --> 27:10.998
What is it
with you people?

27:11.049 --> 27:13.467
I've already told
Agent Morgan.

27:13.534 --> 27:15.469
Was Josh in his room?

27:15.536 --> 27:17.471
Yes.

27:17.538 --> 27:19.306
23 cadets sleep
in that building.

27:19.373 --> 27:21.308
They're saying
he wasn't there.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.010
They're lying.

27:23.061 --> 27:25.212
But that's against
your code.

27:25.263 --> 27:27.376
They haven't been here
long enough to understand

27:27.401 --> 27:28.917
the importance of it.

27:29.217 --> 27:31.639
Did Josh find Bailey
in the laundry room

27:31.664 --> 27:32.864
after that check?

27:33.154 --> 27:35.322
Bailey was his
responsibility.

27:35.389 --> 27:37.324
And who else was there?

27:37.391 --> 27:39.243
No one.

27:39.327 --> 27:40.828
Are we finished?

27:40.895 --> 27:42.830
Tucker Calhoun liked
to pick on Bailey.

27:42.897 --> 27:43.997
Was he there?

27:44.065 --> 27:45.916
No.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.502
Josh didn't have enough
points to go on the trip.

27:48.569 --> 27:50.420
Why did you send him?

27:50.505 --> 27:53.740
He needed the challenge.

27:53.791 --> 27:55.993
Tell me this--

27:56.060 --> 28:01.215
did Josh kill Chris Shelton
in the woods?

28:01.266 --> 28:03.083
He was being chased,

28:03.134 --> 28:05.969
in which case
it was self-defense.

28:07.522 --> 28:10.423
Josh killed a man.

28:11.809 --> 28:14.978
Any advice on how
to tell his parents?

28:20.535 --> 28:23.036
Prentiss said Mr. Shelton
had a cell phone.

28:23.104 --> 28:24.288
I'm gonna need to see that.

28:24.372 --> 28:25.572
Doesn't the school
have a cell phone?

28:25.623 --> 28:27.440
Mm-mmm. Goes against
their policy, remember?

28:27.492 --> 28:29.293
So is playing favorites.
You know, a man like Massey

28:29.377 --> 28:31.078
sets rules but is
the first to break them.

28:31.129 --> 28:33.192
He's been left alone
to run these kids' lives

28:33.217 --> 28:34.568
and nobody questions him.

28:34.883 --> 28:37.551
Oh, man, that sounds so sad and scary
when you put it like that.

28:37.619 --> 28:40.287
His policies are a combination of
many other philosophies.

28:40.338 --> 28:42.389
I'm not sure where
his actual leadership lies.

28:42.456 --> 28:45.475
Only that it does...Lie,
that is.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.593
It's a joke.

28:46.644 --> 28:47.594
Oh.

28:47.645 --> 28:48.645
Good joke.

28:48.730 --> 28:49.646
Yeah.

28:49.731 --> 28:50.681
Oh, my gosh.

28:50.765 --> 28:51.965
The school does
have a cell phone.

28:52.016 --> 28:53.300
Only it's not listed
under Massey.

28:53.351 --> 28:56.236
The account was opened...
by Tawes.

28:56.304 --> 28:58.689
If Massey's lying about
something as simple as a cell phone,

28:58.773 --> 29:00.857
what else is he hiding?

29:03.828 --> 29:07.281
I met Chris Shelton when
he claimed his son's body.

29:07.332 --> 29:10.117
This is the last thing
I expected.

29:10.168 --> 29:13.653
Multiple points of entry
from the spears.

29:13.705 --> 29:16.006
He still wears
his wedding ring.

29:16.090 --> 29:17.341
Bailey was all he had left.

29:17.425 --> 29:19.659
He'd do anything
to protect him.

29:19.711 --> 29:21.178
I'm not sure about that.

29:21.262 --> 29:23.880
Bailey's trachea
showed signs of scarring.

29:23.965 --> 29:25.799
He'd attempted suicide before?

29:25.850 --> 29:28.135
No. It was internal damage.

29:28.202 --> 29:30.170
He had stress
to his heart and lungs

29:30.221 --> 29:32.055
that isn't typical
in someone his age.

29:32.140 --> 29:34.107
It's not in your report.

29:34.175 --> 29:36.143
It wasn't related
to the C.O.D.

29:36.194 --> 29:37.394
How old are the injuries?

29:37.478 --> 29:38.445
It's hard to say.

29:38.529 --> 29:41.898
Then you assume
his father was abusive?

29:41.966 --> 29:43.650
Someone was.

29:43.701 --> 29:45.152
I didn't think
much of it

29:45.203 --> 29:47.571
till I saw similar
scars on the other boys.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.940
Including blisters and
burns on their hands.

29:50.008 --> 29:51.524
On all of them?

29:51.576 --> 29:55.746
Their scars were much older,
but yes. Identical.

30:02.003 --> 30:05.973
Sir, may I?

30:06.040 --> 30:09.810
When did you decide
where the boys would be camping?

30:09.877 --> 30:12.045
The day Tawes
dropped them off.

30:12.096 --> 30:13.847
No one else knew?

30:13.898 --> 30:16.066
No need.

30:17.902 --> 30:19.353
You didn't write it
down anywhere?

30:19.404 --> 30:21.855
We don't use maps
of that terrain.

30:21.906 --> 30:25.359
You're expected
to know it.

30:25.410 --> 30:28.528
Mr. Shelton must have
been quite upset when you saw him.

30:28.579 --> 30:29.863
Of course he was.

30:29.914 --> 30:31.365
Who did he blame?

30:31.416 --> 30:32.666
What?

30:32.733 --> 30:35.702
For his son's suicide.
Who did he blame?

30:35.753 --> 30:37.037
I have no idea.

30:37.088 --> 30:39.239
Well, the guilt must have
manifested itself elsewhere.

30:39.290 --> 30:40.907
Was it you?

30:40.958 --> 30:42.042
Excuse me?

30:42.093 --> 30:43.743
He was a desperate widower

30:43.795 --> 30:46.046
who put his son in your
hands. He trusted you,

30:46.097 --> 30:47.247
and look what happened.

30:47.298 --> 30:48.765
- Ma'am...
- What?

30:48.850 --> 30:50.917
We're trying to help him
and he's keeping things from us.

30:50.968 --> 30:53.186
I have cooperated fully.

30:53.254 --> 30:55.272
Did you blame someone?

30:55.356 --> 30:57.724
Josh Redding?
Tucker Calhoun?

30:57.775 --> 30:58.725
This is ridiculous.

30:58.776 --> 31:00.360
Oh, for God sakes,
Colonel!

31:00.428 --> 31:02.595

I'm sorry. I just don't
have the patience for this.

31:16.127 --> 31:17.494
He's clearly hiding
something.

31:17.578 --> 31:19.496
All due respect, ma'am,

31:19.580 --> 31:21.498
have you been drinking?

31:21.582 --> 31:23.216
What?

31:23.284 --> 31:25.335
What are you
talking about?

31:25.420 --> 31:27.504
Strauss, we have
one shot at this.

31:27.588 --> 31:28.588
You think I don't know that?

31:28.639 --> 31:30.006
Well, if he smelled
what I can smell

31:30.091 --> 31:31.558
on your breath right now,
the credibility

31:31.625 --> 31:34.177
of this investigation
would be compromised.

31:40.601 --> 31:42.102
JJ: The organ damage
is severe,

31:42.153 --> 31:43.854
like the boys
have been suffocated,

31:43.938 --> 31:45.522
but what about
the blisters?

31:45.606 --> 31:48.275
The youngest cadets probably
have the freshest scars.

31:48.326 --> 31:50.861
All right, well, we're gonna need
one of them to admit it.

31:50.945 --> 31:53.747
Hotch, she's drinking.

31:53.814 --> 31:55.198
Strauss?

31:55.283 --> 31:57.451
Yeah. She needs help, man.

31:57.502 --> 31:59.252
She could blow this case.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.370
What happened?

32:00.455 --> 32:02.155
She laid into Massey.

32:02.206 --> 32:04.291
She actually said the kind of things
I would have said.

32:04.342 --> 32:06.659
And for a minute
I was like, ok, good.

32:06.711 --> 32:08.462
She's finally on our side.

32:08.513 --> 32:10.297
But then I smelled it,
Hotch.

I asked you if something
was going on.

about me?

32:22.843 --> 32:24.694
Is that what
you were gonna say?

You know how many times
I've heard that, Hotch?

32:26.614 --> 32:27.981
Well, I am tired of it.

32:28.032 --> 32:30.700
You keep telling me that I have
problems trusting people.

32:30.785 --> 32:32.702
Well, from where
I'm standing,

32:32.787 --> 32:36.540
you're the one who
can't trust anyone with anything.

having trouble with authority.

32:47.201 --> 32:48.535
Ok, I can do that.

32:48.636 --> 32:50.036
But I gotta tell you,
they post rewards

32:50.087 --> 32:51.538
faster than they do demerits.

32:51.589 --> 32:53.373
All right, well, look for kids
who had disciplinary issues

32:53.424 --> 32:54.424
before they came here.

32:54.509 --> 32:55.809
Ok. I got a few.

32:55.876 --> 32:58.845
All right, did any of them have
class with Bailey Shelton?

32:58.896 --> 33:02.149
No, but each of the plebes
have laundry duty. Does that help?

33:02.216 --> 33:04.551
Their dorm is the farthest
point from the laundry room.

33:04.602 --> 33:06.153
Why are they so isolated?

33:06.220 --> 33:08.555
The M.E. said Bailey
had blisters and burns,

33:08.606 --> 33:11.224
fingertips were raw,
his trachea had internal scarring.

33:11.275 --> 33:12.492
That's awful.

33:28.426 --> 33:30.494
Please, Tucker. Please.

33:30.561 --> 33:32.896
Please, Tucker. Please!

33:32.964 --> 33:34.898
Please! Stop it!

33:34.966 --> 33:38.235
Please stop it!
I can't breathe!

33:38.302 --> 33:40.070
- Please!
- Let him out!

33:40.137 --> 33:42.672
[Bailing screaming]

33:42.740 --> 33:44.975
[Dryer turns on]

33:51.616 --> 33:52.782
Go, Bailey, run!

34:05.496 --> 34:07.697
[Grunting]

34:17.058 --> 34:19.150
No. In all the materials
it says they don't believe

34:19.175 --> 34:20.375
in corporal punishment.

34:20.511 --> 34:23.263
Bailey writes about each of those
boys and how they bullied him.

34:23.313 --> 34:25.431
His father must have
read it and wants revenge.

34:25.483 --> 34:27.900
- Does it mention Josh?
- Not at all.

34:27.967 --> 34:29.936
They why would
Chris Shelton go after him?

34:33.157 --> 34:36.993
Prentiss: What if Massey lied
to Chris Shelton?

34:37.078 --> 34:40.030
Rossi:
And set Josh up.

34:40.114 --> 34:41.782
And he convinced Shelton

34:41.806 --> 34:44.676
that Josh was responsible
for Bailey's suicide.

34:45.202 --> 34:47.654
That still doesn't explain how
he found the secluded woods.

34:47.705 --> 34:49.322
Wait, where's
Mr. Shelton's phone?

34:49.373 --> 34:51.373
It's right here.

34:52.510 --> 34:54.427
It's got a couple
of contacts on it,

34:54.495 --> 34:55.828
Somerville Academy
being one of them.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.014
Any unknowns?
Tawes has a cell.

34:58.099 --> 35:01.134
No way. Lieutenant no tech?

35:01.185 --> 35:03.002
There's one unknown.
It's a text.

35:03.054 --> 35:05.138
It looks like, uh,
phone numbers.

35:05.189 --> 35:06.306
What are they?

35:06.357 --> 35:10.777
252-5727...

35:10.844 --> 35:14.447
And 802-8448.

35:14.515 --> 35:17.984
Those aren't phone numbers.
That's latitude and longitude.

35:18.035 --> 35:20.987
Right where those boys
were camping.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.242
Massey's withheld information
at every step along the way.

35:26.327 --> 35:28.295
- He's not to be trusted.
- What's your theory?

35:28.362 --> 35:31.631
He's created a dysfunctional
and abusive environment

35:31.699 --> 35:33.333
in which children
like Bailey Shelton and others

35:33.384 --> 35:35.001
are repeatedly abused.

35:35.052 --> 35:37.003
Josh is a protector type.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.422
His power was taken away
the night Bailey killed himself.

35:39.507 --> 35:41.174
We believe that's when
everything shifted.

35:41.225 --> 35:44.177
Josh's parents said he's been
withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.

35:44.228 --> 35:46.680
There's a good chance that's because
he was planning his escape.

35:46.731 --> 35:48.848
Josh didn't have enough points
to go into the woods,

35:48.899 --> 35:50.049
but Massey sent him anyway.

35:50.101 --> 35:53.052
Why would Massey give Josh
the opportunity to escape?

35:53.104 --> 35:55.054
He wouldn't.
He had another agenda.

35:55.106 --> 35:59.025
Massey texted Chris Shelton
the coordinates for the campsite,

35:59.093 --> 36:01.861
not to hurt all the boys,
but to take out Josh.

36:01.912 --> 36:03.697
But he didn't count on
Josh fighting back.

36:03.748 --> 36:05.782
And he underestimated the power
of Chris Shelton's revenge.

36:05.866 --> 36:09.235
Staging the murders to look exactly
like Bailey's death was a message.

36:09.286 --> 36:10.286
Strauss: To who?

36:10.371 --> 36:11.571
To Massey.

36:11.622 --> 36:13.957
Chris Shelton wanted Massey
to lose his sons, too.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.458
Josh knows Massey
has secrets,

36:15.543 --> 36:18.244
and he's the only person who
can bring the school down.

36:18.295 --> 36:20.797
And now Massey will do
anything to destroy Josh.

36:20.881 --> 36:23.416
[Telephone rings]

36:25.886 --> 36:26.803
Tawes: Sir.

36:26.887 --> 36:28.421
Have you found him yet?

36:28.472 --> 36:30.140
Negative, sir.

36:30.224 --> 36:33.893
You finish this.
Understand?

36:33.944 --> 36:35.612
Yes, sir.

36:54.958 --> 36:57.210
We need to find Josh
before Tawes does.

36:57.261 --> 36:59.011
JJ: Tawes has
a massive head start.

36:59.079 --> 37:01.547
Josh is close and has a plan.
How would he escape?

37:01.615 --> 37:03.182
Rossi:
Get to higher ground.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.550
JJ: What's
the fastest way out?

37:04.601 --> 37:06.519
He'd look for wheels.
How did Chris Shelton get there?

37:06.586 --> 37:09.972
Prentiss: He probably drove his
own car. We didn't see any ATVs.

37:10.057 --> 37:11.641
Garcia: Chris Shelton
drives a truck.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.726
Morgan: Did you see one
on the road on the way in?

37:13.777 --> 37:15.427
- No.
- Where's the next closest road?

37:15.479 --> 37:17.930
Well, it's a trek.
It's at least a few miles north

37:17.981 --> 37:19.265
of where the body
was just found.

37:19.316 --> 37:21.567
That leaves 3 likely areas
where he would have parked.

37:21.618 --> 37:23.435
- Mm-mmm.
- You didn't find any keys, did you?

37:23.487 --> 37:24.537
Because Josh
probably took them.

37:24.604 --> 37:26.455
All right, we need
to divide up.

37:39.469 --> 37:41.787
[Engine won't start]

37:41.839 --> 37:44.290
Come on.

37:44.341 --> 37:46.509
Aah!

38:11.501 --> 38:12.501
Uhh!

38:15.155 --> 38:18.157
[Groaning]

38:20.677 --> 38:22.962
I've waited 3 years
for this.

38:23.013 --> 38:24.347
You little bitch.

38:36.643 --> 38:38.510
- Uhh!
- Tawes, don't do it.

38:38.562 --> 38:39.845
It's over.

38:41.899 --> 38:45.067
[Gasps, groaning]

38:58.698 --> 39:00.366
Yes, Mrs. Jarvis.

39:00.417 --> 39:02.335
I understand your concerns,

39:02.386 --> 39:04.870
but we're all fine.

39:05.973 --> 39:08.641
Soldiers, ma'am.

39:08.708 --> 39:10.810
Call anytime.

39:13.647 --> 39:15.064
Colonel Ron Massey,

39:15.148 --> 39:16.899
you're under arrest.

39:17.985 --> 39:19.969
I've done nothing.

39:20.037 --> 39:22.672
You texted Chris Shelton
the coordinates of the campsite.

39:22.739 --> 39:25.141
That makes you
an accessory to murder.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.659
Texted?

39:26.726 --> 39:28.694
Ok, fine.

39:28.745 --> 39:31.247
You had Tawes do it.

39:31.331 --> 39:33.582
Why would I do that?

39:33.667 --> 39:36.252
Because you had now power
or control over Josh,

39:36.336 --> 39:37.670
and you couldn't
handle that.

39:37.737 --> 39:40.423
The problem is, he wasn't
gonna go away quietly.

39:40.490 --> 39:43.909
He wanted you to pay
for all those years of abuse.

39:46.346 --> 39:48.747
No one will believe Josh.

39:48.799 --> 39:50.466
He's a troubled boy.

39:50.550 --> 39:52.635
He's a grown man, Colonel.

39:54.271 --> 39:55.938
You should be proud.

40:49.242 --> 40:51.944
Morgan: "Beware,
so long as you live,

40:51.995 --> 40:54.313
of judging men by their
outward appearance."

40:54.364 --> 40:57.867
Jean de La Fontaine.

41:00.003 --> 41:00.953
[Knocking]

41:01.004 --> 41:02.488
You got a minute?

41:06.176 --> 41:08.094
Yeah.

41:09.179 --> 41:11.830
[Knocking, door opens]

41:21.808 --> 41:24.310
Do you have
the after-action report?

41:24.361 --> 41:26.645
No.

41:26.713 --> 41:28.948
I need it on my desk
by the morning.

41:29.015 --> 41:31.817
I'll give it
to the director.

41:31.868 --> 41:33.903
Pardon?

41:33.987 --> 41:37.990
It's time for you to admit that
you need some help.

41:38.041 --> 41:42.078
I don't take orders
from you, Aaron.

41:42.162 --> 41:43.496
You put my team
in jeopardy.

41:43.547 --> 41:46.465
Is that what you told him,
Agent Morgan?

41:46.533 --> 41:48.634
You compromised
the integrity of the unit.

41:48.701 --> 41:51.253
I did no such thing.

41:51.338 --> 41:53.672
Open the drawer, ma'am.

41:54.925 --> 41:56.976
This is absurd.

41:57.043 --> 41:58.644
Aaron.

41:58.728 --> 42:00.763
Aaron, what are you doing?

42:00.847 --> 42:02.731
[Bottles rattling]

42:07.270 --> 42:11.857
One call to the E.A.P.
and everything will be all right.

42:11.908 --> 42:16.195
In what world
will this be all right?

42:26.239 --> 42:30.409
You have no idea what
this is going to do to me.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.929
Agent Morgan will make sure
that you get checked in privately.

42:34.014 --> 42:37.133
And for that
you should be grateful.

42:41.721 --> 42:44.256
I'll wait outside.
