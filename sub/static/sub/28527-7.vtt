WEBVTT

00:08.758 --> 00:11.636
Oh, please don't be
a grosser-than-normal death

00:11.720 --> 00:15.223
that ruins my memory
of the most incredible,

00:15.306 --> 00:16.808
romantic meal of my life.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.560
-[Liv] You brought Peyton to Le Dome?
-[Ravi] Mmm.

00:18.643 --> 00:19.519
On your salary?

00:19.602 --> 00:22.188
So worth dropping premium cable.
The remoulade...

00:22.272 --> 00:23.189
[chef's kiss]

00:23.273 --> 00:24.107
[speaks French]

00:24.274 --> 00:27.444
Chef's a genius.
So I searched the AKA database

00:27.527 --> 00:29.446
for that Utopium chemist
Major told us about.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.530
From the surveillance tape?

00:31.031 --> 00:33.950
-Beanpole Bob?
-Not a single hit.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.912
Several variations of "Mike the Pole,
Joe the Pole, so-and-so the Pole,"

00:38.121 --> 00:39.497
all miscreants of Polish descent.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.916
Ooh, one "Beanpole Jim,"
inept cat burglar,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.293
he perished in an AC duct.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.794
Zero "Beanpole Bobs."

00:44.878 --> 00:46.087
"Beanpole Bob."

00:46.254 --> 00:48.965
Sounds like the Little Rascal
that ended up on the cutting room floor.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.675
[camera clicking]

00:54.637 --> 00:56.681
Eleanor Hickmott, Head Chef.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.808
Best guess, suffocation.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.268
So much for the remoulade.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.187
At least it's not a gross one.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.524
More like somebody wanted her "to go."

01:08.735 --> 01:09.694
He gets it.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.615
[opening theme music playing]

01:36.721 --> 01:40.266
What's stumping me is that her arms
and hands were free when she died,

01:40.683 --> 01:42.685
but I didn't see signs of struggle,
which just doesn't seem--

01:42.769 --> 01:43.853
Are you the detective?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.230
I am. And you are?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.981
Saul Manero, I own the place.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.360
Any leads on my missing brains?
We open in four hours.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.694
You're missing brains?

01:51.903 --> 01:54.531
Twelve in the freezer yesterday,
this morning, zip.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.575
Oh, we're mostly focused on,
you know, the murder,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.452
-but noted.
-[sighs]

01:59.536 --> 02:02.038
Is there anyone you can think of
who might've wished her harm?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.290
Anyone? Try everyone.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.668
She was an unrelenting perfectionist.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.087
She fired people for existing wrong.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.632
Who didn't fantasize about
offing that lady? Total nightmare.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.218
-So, did you fantasize about--
-Oh, yeah.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.138
Not like that, though,
more a machete thing.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.475
Oh. She must've been an amazing chef.

02:22.767 --> 02:23.726
A genius.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.270
But also a monster.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.855
It happens, you know.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.940
Edison electrocuted puppies.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.317
[Liv] Wow. Fun fact.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.069
Are your personnel files up to date?

02:33.236 --> 02:36.447
I'd like to get the files
of everyone Ms. Hickmott fired.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.950
Ooh. Wait here.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.164
[scoffs] I want to remember you
like this, Liv.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
-[sighs]
-Pre-total nightmare.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.959
Yeah. Oh, hey,

02:48.543 --> 02:51.462
you ever come across
a Beanpole Bob back in Vice?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.007
Utopium cook for Mr. Boss?

02:54.299 --> 02:56.843
Ravi thinks that if he can lead us
to tainted Utopium,

02:57.093 --> 02:58.845
CDC has equipment that could analyze it.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.265
We could copy it,
basically open a zombie cure factory.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.726
Beanpole Bob? It's not ringing any bells.

03:05.059 --> 03:05.977
[Saul] So,

03:06.394 --> 03:08.521
you're gonna eat chef's brain, right?
That's how it works?

03:09.188 --> 03:11.232
Yeah. That's, uh... That's what I do.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.483
Her remoulade.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.527
She never wrote anything down.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.822
Try it. Call me the second
the recipe comes to you.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.575
It doesn't quite work like that.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.119
Liv, for God's sakes. Take the remoulade!

03:24.120 --> 03:25.163
Okay.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.582
[bossa nova music playing]

03:47.727 --> 03:48.686
Mmm.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.064
[Saxon on computer] <i>There's no room</i>
<i>for discussion, Dr. Chakrabarti.</i>

03:51.189 --> 03:52.941
<i>The CDC will no longer partner with you.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:55.944
<i>You lied about Freylich Syndrome brains</i>
<i>when you knew they were a cure.</i>

03:56.069 --> 03:58.321
Do you understand the danger
those kids are in now?

03:58.404 --> 03:59.614
They will be hunted.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.950
<i>-I think you're being a bit overdramatic.</i>
-[Ravi scoffs]

04:02.033 --> 04:04.160
Come live in Seattle for a while,
and see if you feel the same.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.287
<i>Goodbye, Doctor.</i>

04:06.371 --> 04:07.372
Wha...

04:08.164 --> 04:10.416

[laughs awkwardly]

04:11.334 --> 04:13.253
-This is unreal.

04:16.881 --> 04:19.050

04:19.425 --> 04:20.385
Really?

04:20.843 --> 04:22.845

04:22.929 --> 04:26.099
<i>I mean, I needed to come in late</i>

<i>we don't get to have the luxury</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:35.108
Uh, what was the emergency? Sorry.
That's none of my business.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.235
<i>Just some stuff with my mom.</i>

04:38.194 --> 04:39.570
If there's anything I can do...

04:42.240 --> 04:43.992
<i>Actually, Ravi,</i>

04:44.784 --> 04:45.618
<i>there might be.</i>

04:48.705 --> 04:52.208
This explains why she didn't fight back
while being methodically plastic-wrapped.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.877
Hematoma, evidence of concussion.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.796
She was conked on the head,
then wrapped up,

04:57.046 --> 04:58.840
sometime around 1:00 a.m.

04:58.965 --> 04:59.924
Conked with what?

05:00.174 --> 05:01.467
Based on the bruise,

05:01.676 --> 05:03.886
something about the width
of a French bread.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.139
We don't need to have a motif here.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.473
You asked.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.559
Fine. We'll keep our eyes peeled

05:09.642 --> 05:11.477
-for menacing bread.
-Hmm.

05:12.270 --> 05:16.107
Hmm... Garlic, paprika, horseradish...

05:17.692 --> 05:19.444
What, is it "Gawk Like a Moron" Day?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.195
Somebody write this down!

05:21.487 --> 05:22.739
Insult me all you want,

05:23.114 --> 05:24.824
as long as you save me
some of that remoulade.

05:27.160 --> 05:27.994
Enjoy.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.545
I'm gonna go grab
some Hellfire Puffs. You guys?

05:37.712 --> 05:38.880
-We're good.
-All right.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.257
[sighs]

05:42.633 --> 05:45.011
Man, have you ever seen
that guy eat anything green?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.346
[scoffs] One day
he's just gonna drop dead.

I'm gonna strip the leather.

Well, somebody oughta remind Justin

06:18.836 --> 06:21.464
he just ordered an inspection
two days ago.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.861
Seriously? Okay.
So, let me get this straight.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.697
First you kidnap me
and turn me into a zombie.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.700
And now you want me
to do Fillmore Graves a favor?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.744
I want you to do the people of Seattle,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.913
zombies and humans, a favor.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.583
Look, I'm talking self-preservation here.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.168
Your dad wants to see you--

06:59.293 --> 07:00.461
General Mills and I

07:00.545 --> 07:02.922
haven't been on speaking terms
for a long time.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.508
He's not particularly open-minded.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.802
He's going to be here
with a contingent from the US government.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.555
The man holds sway at the Pentagon.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.849
It's in our best interest
not to piss him off.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.308
[door opens]

07:14.392 --> 07:16.519
Commander, Captain Bell
just called from lockdown.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.646

08:23.294 --> 08:24.462
[Hobbs] It was quick and well-planned.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.215
The intruders killed two outside,
four in the break room.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.008
-Why weren't they at their posts?
-Don't know.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.801
They took eight prisoners
from the deep freeze.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.971
All known Chase Graves loyalists,
Enzo included.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.807
-Oh, and, uh, Peters is missing.
-Peters?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.518
He was posted at the entrance.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.729
He must've been their inside source.
They had to have one.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.607
Where's Justin?

08:45.650 --> 08:46.651
[indistinct radio chatter]

09:07.838 --> 09:09.882
[Clive]<i> Okay, look alive, people.</i>

09:10.216 --> 09:12.969
I've got a mugging-turned-deadly
outside of a hockey rink,

09:13.052 --> 09:16.514
just need someone to follow up
with the Zamboni driver who witnessed it.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.307
Cavanaugh, think you can handle that?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.060
Oh, sorry, sir,
I was just lost in the luster

09:21.143 --> 09:22.895
-of your warm, brown eyes.
-[all chuckling]

09:23.479 --> 09:24.897
[Clive] It's still my wife's office.

09:25.022 --> 09:28.734
If she's got a thing
for my lustrous brown eyes, well...

09:29.235 --> 09:30.194
Who can blame her?

09:31.070 --> 09:34.323
-Okay. The Fleet Street Stabber--
-[knocking on door]

09:34.949 --> 09:36.284
Heard you guys could use help.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.536
Uh, Michelle? What, uh...

09:38.786 --> 09:39.954
You didn't get the paperwork?

09:40.037 --> 09:42.456
[clears throat]
This is the Lieutenant inbox.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.292
They put that kind of information
in there.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.794
I'm supposed to fill in
for Detective Babineaux

09:47.003 --> 09:48.087
for the next few weeks.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.007
Apparently, they kicked him upstairs.
You got a case for me?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.550
I'll take the Fleet Street Stabber

09:52.633 --> 09:54.176
-if no one else--
-Oh... [stammering]

09:54.260 --> 09:56.846
Actually, Cavanaugh is rolling with that.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.931
-He is?
-Yeah, you are.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.809
Michelle, we need a statement
from the Zamboni driver

10:01.934 --> 10:03.728
at the Seattle Sockeyes' practice rink.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.563
I'll give it my best, Detective.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.190
All right, then. Go solve some murders.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.237
Are you gonna be weird about this?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.031
What? Weird?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.367
[sighs] Not at all.

10:19.035 --> 10:19.869
It's...

10:21.412 --> 10:22.246
not weird.

10:23.831 --> 10:24.665
Okay, then.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.126
[tapping on window]

10:30.254 --> 10:31.213
[gags]

10:32.131 --> 10:34.925
Dear God! Did someone
run this through cat litter?

10:35.885 --> 10:36.802
[sighs]

10:39.013 --> 10:41.641
[Clive] So, Jerry, I see
on your Le Dome application that you--

10:41.766 --> 10:44.101
Misspelled "communication skills."

10:44.352 --> 10:46.270
What is this font called? "Rube"?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
...were previously a line cook.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.776
And yet you took
a dishwasher job at Le Dome?

10:51.859 --> 10:53.027
I was a cook at the Fly Wheel.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.946
[scoffs] What did that involve,
opening a can?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.406
More or less.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.950
I decided it'd be better
to work my way up at Le Dome

11:00.034 --> 11:00.951
than stay a line cook

11:01.035 --> 11:02.161
-at the Fly Wheel, where--
-[knocking on door]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.207
Jenkins, what are you doing?

11:07.625 --> 11:08.542
[sniffing]

11:11.128 --> 11:12.088
Tolerable.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.342
Wet the filter next time.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.637
Oh, brother.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.597
So,

11:21.764 --> 11:24.225
the owner says that, as dishwasher,

11:25.059 --> 11:26.685
you're usually the last one
to leave the restaurant.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.688
Most of the time.
But Chef was still in her office

11:29.772 --> 11:31.107
when I left the night she was killed.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.191
Did you check on her?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.776
No. But I could hear her yelling.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.487
Really burying the lede here, Jerry.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.280
Sounded like she was fighting with Herb.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.407
That's...

11:41.951 --> 11:43.994
-Herbert Cassel, head waiter?
-Yeah.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.329
Could you tell what it was about?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.581
No. Just angry shouting.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.501
I thought it was a robbery thing.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.962
Word is someone stole our brain supply.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.591
Could 12 brains really be
a motive for murder?

11:57.758 --> 12:00.761
Twelve brains.
About two pounds, 14 ounces each.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.012
-Street value--
-Last I heard,

12:02.096 --> 12:05.015
about $650 a kilo, so...

12:05.141 --> 12:07.435
15.65 kilos in 34.5 pounds.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.812
Then 15.65 times 650.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.356
So, $10,173.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.151
Ten grand.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.861
We've seen people kill for less.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.946
But still, we should talk to this waiter.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.156
No kidding.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.617
What caveman taught you penmanship?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.872
Uh, excuse me?

12:29.874 --> 12:30.708
Charli?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.378
God. Did that bitch really not tell you
she had a twin?

12:35.796 --> 12:36.755
Oh, uh...

12:37.465 --> 12:41.343
[stammering] Charli just asked for help
getting her sister Lila a message.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.554
And yet, she's the smart one.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.308
The one that doesn't realize saying "twin"
is the same as saying "sister"

12:47.391 --> 12:48.601
but with more information.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.102
Unless the twin is a brother.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.189
Uh, look, um, my boss gave me your card.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.109
"Ravi Chakrabarti. Medical examiner."

12:57.193 --> 13:00.821
My number is on there.
I thought you'd call, and I could--

13:01.030 --> 13:03.574
Yeah. Given the choice of calling
some dude on the phone,

13:03.657 --> 13:05.159
and going to meet him at a morgue,

13:05.576 --> 13:06.410
I'm picking morgue.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.413
Right. What better place to have a snog
with your boyfriend.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.165
He's not my boyfriend.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.334
I met him at an open mic last night.

13:13.417 --> 13:17.087
He's just here because I'm not gonna go
meet some strange guy by myself

13:17.171 --> 13:18.088
like a lunatic.

13:18.797 --> 13:19.673
Cool.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.512
You know I've got to see one, right?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.349
I mean, I can't come to a morgue
and not see a dead body. What's the point?

13:28.432 --> 13:33.229
Uh, well, I guess the point is,
as I mentioned in the note,

13:33.312 --> 13:35.105
your sister is eager to speak to you.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.982
She's been trying
to track you down for months.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.917
-Whoa.
-Oh...

13:56.126 --> 13:59.838
So perhaps we could just
video chat with Charli now?

14:00.714 --> 14:01.674
<i>Hey, Ravi.</i>

14:02.216 --> 14:03.217
Hello, uh...

14:03.717 --> 14:04.927
There's someone here to see you.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.845
What's up?

14:07.721 --> 14:08.681
<i>Lila!</i>

14:09.306 --> 14:11.392
<i>Wow. Ravi found you.</i>

14:11.934 --> 14:14.562
Hey, so, did you tell Mom
you were the one to lose her ring?

14:14.645 --> 14:15.646
<i>Okay...</i>

14:16.897 --> 14:19.400
<i>Lila, I've tried. But--</i>

14:19.483 --> 14:21.986
And you're still dead to me.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.445
Okay. Bye-bye.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.322
Piss off. Ciao.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.283
-What, uh... Wait. What?
-Let's go, Pete.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.659
My name is Silvio.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.911
Really? That's kind of hot.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.373
So what's this about a ring?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.042
<i>It's this missing family heirloom. </i>[sighs]

14:37.543 --> 14:39.879
<i>Mom thinks Lila lost it,</i>
<i>because that's what Lila does.</i>

14:40.296 --> 14:42.965
<i>Lila swears I lost it,</i>
<i>but I know for a fact I never had it.</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:45.217
<i>She needs me to be</i>
<i>the bad sister at least once.</i>

14:45.885 --> 14:47.887
So maybe do that?

14:48.095 --> 14:50.598
<i>I've tried. I tell Mom I lost the ring,</i>

14:50.681 --> 14:53.392
<i>and two minutes later she forgets</i>
<i>and curses out Lila.</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:57.479
<i>Yesterday, she called me crying</i>
<i>because she couldn't find her cat</i>

14:57.563 --> 14:59.189
<i>that died six years ago.</i>

15:00.065 --> 15:01.025
Alzheimer's?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.110
<i>That's what I wanted to tell Lila.</i>

15:03.569 --> 15:04.737
I'm so sorry.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.449
<i>I wanted her to reconnect with Mom</i>
<i>while she was still Mom.</i>

15:10.826 --> 15:13.913
So, Herbert.
It says here you found the body.

15:14.121 --> 15:14.955
I did.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.916
As head waiter, one of my duties

15:16.999 --> 15:19.919
is to, uh, prep the waitstaff
on the specials.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.504
But the morning I found Chef, I get there,

15:23.088 --> 15:25.758
and there is a pork loin
and duck thawing on the counter...

15:26.467 --> 15:28.594
with cabbage and warm beet salad.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.511
[scoffs]

15:33.432 --> 15:37.019
So I went into her office
to get to the bottom of that,

15:38.354 --> 15:39.563
and that's when I found her.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.858
So the night before, you leave,
and the dishwasher closes up?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.401
That's the usual routine.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.195
And the night before?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.155
Yes. Like normal.

15:49.531 --> 15:50.991
So why did the dishwasher tell us

15:51.075 --> 15:53.077
that the last thing he heard
before leaving was

15:53.160 --> 15:55.496
you and the chef arguing in her office?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.872
Oh, uh... [chuckles]

15:58.290 --> 15:59.917
Right. Uh, that's true.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.378
Uh, we were just discussing
a few details--

16:02.503 --> 16:05.130
Discussing? He heard you from the kitchen.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.132
You're not being
upfront with us here, Herbert.

16:07.591 --> 16:11.011
About being the last to see her,
about the tenor of your conversation.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.388
Why is that?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.641
Oh, I suppose I thought those details
might make me seem guilty.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.935
Lying definitely makes you seem guilty.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.605
With all the brains missing,
why aren't you looking at the zombies?

16:21.730 --> 16:22.648
I mean, generally.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.025
Chef de Cerveaux in particular?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.735
-Chef de--
-The brain chef.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.362
Jake. He hated Eleanor. He--

16:28.487 --> 16:29.446
The pork loin!

16:30.781 --> 16:32.574
The pork loin was the murder weapon!

16:33.242 --> 16:36.370
Warm beet salad? Cabbage?
Those go with duck.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.913
What other reason

16:37.997 --> 16:40.374
would there be for a pork loin
to be thawing on the counter?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.626
Knocked out by meat?
Is that even possible?

16:42.751 --> 16:45.129
If it was frozen,
it'd be like swinging a club.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.090
Ravi did say the murder weapon was
French bread-sized.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.509
I mean, do we DNA test the pork?

16:50.634 --> 16:53.554
Actually, the pork loin was served.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.222
With warm beet salad?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.641
[scoffs] Were fries extra?

16:57.933 --> 16:59.685
Did they come served in a box

16:59.768 --> 17:01.812
-with a prize?
-We did have one order sent back.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.232
Ten years I've been
head waiter at Le Dome.

17:05.315 --> 17:09.528
This was the first time a customer
has ever found a hair in their meal.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.699
Chef de cerveaux,
it's a ridiculous concept.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.743
Brains. Hot sauce.
Throw in bits of whatever

17:15.826 --> 17:18.037
for the hell of it, and mix it up.
It's not cuisine.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.955
I'm not in a position to argue with that.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.707
-I just want to ask the brain chef...
-[cell phone ringing]

17:21.790 --> 17:24.460
...some questions. One sec. Hello?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.382
Do those spoons look right to you?

17:32.968 --> 17:34.887
Do you even know spoons?

17:35.554 --> 17:38.515
Because those are both soup spoons.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.725
[scoffs]

17:42.102 --> 17:43.479
[cutlery clattering]

17:43.896 --> 17:44.938
So...

17:48.150 --> 17:51.695
Michelle was out interviewing
the Zamboni driver like I asked her to.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.364
The Sockeyes were out on the ice.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.743
-It's just, what are the odds?
-What happened, Clive?

17:58.160 --> 18:01.789
Player misfired a slap-shot,
puck flew over the glass and hit Michelle.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.249
She's in the hospital.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.424
Hey.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.511
Good thing you didn't give me
the Fleet Street Stabber case.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.596
I could've gotten seriously injured.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.890
How're you feeling?

18:20.390 --> 18:21.725
How's the baby?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.477
The baby's fine.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.730
On the other hand,
I feel like I was hit by hard rubber

18:26.814 --> 18:28.440
traveling at 100 miles per hour.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.276
And embarrassed.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.612
Please tell me
they didn't call the station.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.614
Actually...

18:39.326 --> 18:42.412
When you were admitted,
your OB/GYN's office called me.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.332
I guess the hospital reached out to them.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.458
They did?

18:48.418 --> 18:50.379
Oh, oh... Oh, God...

18:53.882 --> 18:57.344
They told me you put me down
as the father of the baby,

18:59.054 --> 19:00.764
and your "in case of emergency..."

19:06.353 --> 19:07.729
The baby's not yours, Clive.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.358
Or, at least the odds are against it.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.861
We just had the one time.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.904
Shane and I, well...

19:16.488 --> 19:19.408
Well, let's just say
it's 30 times more likely it's Shane's.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.705
Well, why would you--

19:24.997 --> 19:27.207
'Cause, well, look at you.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.127
You're here.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.673
You brought me snacks
and flowers and crosswords.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.635
Sudokus. But I'm happy to go back.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.970
Of course you are.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.390
And that's why I wrote your name in
on that form.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.644
You're the man women want
as the father of their child.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.732
Because in the worst-case situation,
there's no doubt

19:51.940 --> 19:54.568
that Clive Babineaux is gonna show up
and be a rock.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.779
I knew that even though
you were someone else's husband.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.116
Sorry.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.912
Not sorry.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.881
You lie!

20:16.840 --> 20:17.841
[Eva] Olivia?

20:20.928 --> 20:21.762
Mom?

20:29.603 --> 20:30.604
What are you doing here?

20:31.647 --> 20:34.233
Circumstance demanded it.
I didn't think you worked this late.

20:37.861 --> 20:38.820
How are you doing?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.114
Is that rhetorical?

20:42.241 --> 20:45.702
You haven't cared enough how I'm doing
to return my calls, my letters...

20:52.209 --> 20:53.293
Don't talk to me like that.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.504
Like you're the aggrieved party here.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.092
You left your brother to die
without any kind of explanation.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.636
Well, surely by now you've figured out
why I did what I did.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.263
-I would've turned him into a zombie.
-[scoffs]

21:04.596 --> 21:07.391
And that may seem almost normal now,
but at the time, I wasn't sure that

21:07.516 --> 21:10.435
-that was the best option.
-You just walked away, Liv.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.145
-You could've--
-Could've what?

21:12.437 --> 21:13.397
Told you?

21:14.064 --> 21:16.400
"Mom, I'm a zombie. I'm a walking corpse."

21:16.608 --> 21:18.277
Your dead child didn't want to be the one

21:18.360 --> 21:21.196
who killed your other child.
And maybe I was wrong.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.906
Maybe I would do it differently today.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.826
But I have tried apologizing
a thousand different ways.

21:25.909 --> 21:29.079
And if you haven't found a way
to forgive me, I'm done trying.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.206
But I knew, Mom, I knew

21:31.290 --> 21:33.583
that you could save him
at the snap of your fingers.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.335
I assume that's what you did.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.838
-I saw Arthur at the hospital that day.
-Arthur?

21:39.006 --> 21:40.882
-Dr. Gorin?
-Yeah.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.551
Uncle Art.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.136
Your best friend.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.889
You two were so close. You thought
Evan and I hadn't figured it out.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.933
-But we did.
-You lost me, Liv.

21:50.142 --> 21:50.976
Stop!

21:51.226 --> 21:53.770
Please. He's our dad.
We know he's our dad.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.105
We've known that for a long time.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.232
Arthur is not your father.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.817
Can't you stop lying?

21:59.693 --> 22:00.694
What does it matter now?

22:01.194 --> 22:03.363
You wanna know who your father really is?

22:03.530 --> 22:05.115
You're just dying to know?

22:05.699 --> 22:06.783
He was a junkie.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.495
A lousy, lying drug addict.
Feel better now?

22:11.079 --> 22:12.831
He was out of the picture
by the time you were born.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.666
I heard he went into rehab,

22:14.750 --> 22:16.668
joined Doctors Without Borders,

22:16.877 --> 22:18.045
traveled the world.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.382
When he was sober,
he was a lovely, lovely man, brilliant.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.135
Then he showed up back in Seattle.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.344
Came to see me.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.682
You. But I wouldn't let him see you
until I was sure.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.851
I thought he had changed.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.187
He hadn't.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.564
Where is he now?

22:40.650 --> 22:42.402
The last time I saw him, he was...

22:43.320 --> 22:47.282
[sighs] On Pioneer Square
with a paper cup, begging for change.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.076
What's his name?

22:54.664 --> 22:55.916
Martin Roberts.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.087
Don't look for him, Liv.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.172
He'll only disappoint you.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.592
Mom.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.055
Tell Evan I miss him.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.141
He's not interested.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.273
-Give me that thing, man!
-No!

23:21.066 --> 23:22.567
So you'll head out to Lewiston.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.153
We'll send Riley out with you,
get her trained up.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.863
-[boys yelling]
-[video game beeping]

23:26.947 --> 23:28.782
Liv, check this out.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.200
[yelling continues]

23:31.284 --> 23:33.870
Quiet! We're trying to save lives here.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.164
Just keep it down.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.798
[sighs]

23:46.091 --> 23:47.592
They can't go outside, Liv.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.262
They just get a bit stir-crazy.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.890
I need off this brain.

23:55.433 --> 23:56.977
Did you know Le Dome

23:57.060 --> 24:00.605
is the only human-zombie restaurant
to receive a Michelin star?

24:01.148 --> 24:01.982
Nope.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.277
Mornin', sunshine.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.948
This is Liv Moore from the ME's office.
And this is Jake Dryden,

24:10.115 --> 24:12.659
the <i>chef de chapeau. </i>

24:13.160 --> 24:14.286
The hat chef?

24:14.536 --> 24:15.370
Close enough.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.666
Jake was just telling me how
he used to be the head chef at Le Dome

24:19.749 --> 24:21.668
before contracting the zombie virus.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.671
It's hard to prepare gourmet meals
when your taste buds are shot.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.257
Beethoven was deaf. Suck it up.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.302
A dozen top-quality brains were stolen.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.139
One staffer suggested
zombie employees might be stealing brains.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.184
There are three zombies
currently employed at Le Dome,

24:37.559 --> 24:40.312
you, Don the waiter,
and Raymond the busboy.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.898
Raymond and Don were
out with a group of co-workers.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.733
-Their alibi is airtight.
-Mmm.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.484
How do you get your brains?

24:47.068 --> 24:48.820
-They're imported--
-Smuggled.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.739
A distinction without a difference.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.284
All of the brains
feeding Seattle zombies are smuggled.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.787
We prepaid for some of the top minds
on the continent.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.916
They're frozen within moments of death,
then transported via--

25:00.999 --> 25:02.792
Wait, wait. They're frozen?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.045
So they're kept in a freezer?

25:06.838 --> 25:07.672
Yes.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.966
So if someone was caught stealing brains,

25:10.050 --> 25:12.219
that pork loin would've been
right within reach.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.929
That supports the robbery theory.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.472
[Jake] Okay. Listen... [clears throat]

25:15.639 --> 25:17.307
I'm not sure I like where this is heading.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.310
Next time you want to talk to me,
I'll be bringing my lawyer.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.022
You know
what that lawyer's gonna tell you?

25:24.105 --> 25:26.566
That you have no right
to search me. You're not the cops--

25:26.650 --> 25:28.026
[grunting] Hey! Hey!

25:30.862 --> 25:32.781
-[exhales]
-[door opens]

25:34.574 --> 25:35.742
See something? Say something.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.119
Chef caught an employee stealing brains.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.079
Yeah?

25:40.247 --> 25:43.500
He was taking them out
by shrink-wrapping them around his torso.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.335
I know I saw him in here.

25:46.628 --> 25:47.629
[gasps]

25:48.171 --> 25:50.173
Here he is. Darren Caulley.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.050
He's got to be our guy.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.887
If people had been at their posts,
most of them would still be alive.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.139
Any idea what drew them away?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.016
Boredom?

26:01.643 --> 26:02.727
I was afraid of that.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.772
I kept trying to drill them,
keep them sharp.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.565
Where were you when you got shot?

26:08.942 --> 26:09.776
There.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.279
They must've thought
they got me in the head.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.114
You get a look at 'em?

26:14.698 --> 26:16.658
Yeah. Not our guys.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.368
I don't know who they were.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.287
They were efficient, though.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.289
They've had some training.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.375
Best guess? Dead Enders.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.252
They're getting bolder.

26:27.794 --> 26:28.878
Dead Enders?

26:29.587 --> 26:31.756
You know, they pulled
eight of our most militant soldiers

26:31.840 --> 26:33.091
out of the deep freeze.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.385
-What purpose would Dead Enders--
-You asked for my opinion.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.178
I asked if you saw them.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.473
I know you don't want to think
Peters could be involved.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.600
You trained him, right?

26:43.935 --> 26:45.061
He's a good guy.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.022
Lousy soldier, though.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.274
And capable of planning an operation
like this?

26:49.357 --> 26:50.692
Oh, God no.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.193
[both chuckle]

26:52.277 --> 26:54.612
[news anchor on TV] <i>Unrest</i>

Okay. What is it?

27:07.792 --> 27:09.044

27:25.560 --> 27:27.687
[chuckles] She gets it.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.272
Now, I admire that woman.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.524
Ms. Durkins sees things clearly.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.651
She just happens to be on the wrong side.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.862
We both know what's coming.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.073
-And we both want our side to win.
-[turns hair dryer off]

27:40.033 --> 27:41.659
She'd probably make a good zombie.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.415
[greeting in French]

27:55.173 --> 27:58.134
So the guy you thought was your dad
isn't your dad?

27:58.426 --> 27:59.427
That's what she told me.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.553
Heavy.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.554
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:05.850 --> 28:08.061

get some use of the brain's upside.

<i>I've been making a mess</i>
<i>over everything else.</i>

28:11.147 --> 28:12.190
<i>Sounds fun.</i>

28:15.193 --> 28:16.111
I'll text you the time.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.946
<i>Duty calls. Bye.</i>

28:18.363 --> 28:19.364
Yeah, bye.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.074
[Peters] Commander.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.535
Peters.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.161
We've been looking for you.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.788
I need your help.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.082
They'll kill me if they find me.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.333
Who says I won't?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.460
Six soldiers died the other night.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.297
Best case, you're the deserter
who abandoned his post.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.800
Worst case, you're the traitor
who helped orchestrate their deaths.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.510
I'm neither of those things, sir.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.846
But I know who the traitor is.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.305
Who?

28:44.848 --> 28:45.682
Captain Bell.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.226
Your good buddy, Justin.

28:55.024 --> 28:55.859
Talk.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.694
I left my post.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.362
Just to get a snack.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.614
Now, I was gone maybe five minutes.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.366
When I come back...

29:04.159 --> 29:05.285
rest of my squad's dead.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.079
There's four more dead in the break room.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.291
I heard noises down the hall,
toward the freezers.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.168
When I turn the corner, I see them.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.462
Heavily armed soldiers,

29:15.754 --> 29:17.130
I've never seen them before.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.176
And they're all just huddled together.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.386
And they're just having a chat.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.431
-Yeah?
-With Captain Bell.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.600
Now, he's bloody, but he's fine.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.685
Just standing there, casual as can be.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.520
-No.
-Think about it.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.648
No one was where they should've been. Why?

29:36.232 --> 29:38.067
'Cause Captain Bell ordered an inspection.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.821
People were polishing boots, making beds.

29:42.655 --> 29:43.656
Commander,

29:44.741 --> 29:47.285
he wanted them exactly where they were.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.042
No. Somebody needs to be there.
She can't be alone.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.419
I know. That's why I pay you.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.090
I'm gonna call you back. Stay. Bye.

30:04.552 --> 30:07.555
<i>-Lila.</i>
-So this British friend of yours

30:08.056 --> 30:09.307
is kind of stalking me now.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.642
So thanks for that.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.101
<i>-Yeah?</i>
-Yeah.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.021
The dude's outside work when I get there.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.439
He's out there when I leave.

30:16.689 --> 30:21.861
He keeps texting me articles
and YouTube videos and movie clips.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.655
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>The Notebook,</i> by the way?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.114
<i>Everybody's seen </i>The Notebook.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.157
I hadn't.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.076
I was perfectly happy.

30:28.326 --> 30:32.121
[tearfully]
Now Ryan Gosling is ruined for me. See?

30:32.288 --> 30:34.123
I almost just cried when I said his name.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.416
[chuckles]

30:35.500 --> 30:36.417
[Lila] The part...

30:36.918 --> 30:39.128
when Rachel McAdams is an old lady,

30:39.212 --> 30:40.713
and then she remembers him,

30:41.339 --> 30:42.674
and they die together...

30:43.508 --> 30:45.093
[sighs deeply]

30:45.176 --> 30:46.135
You're a bastard.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.392
I'm sorry to hear about Mom.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.895
And I'm sorry that
you're having to deal with everything.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.439
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

30:58.857 --> 31:01.276
Your boy says
I can use his computer any time.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.237
How's Tuesday, five o'clock?

31:04.988 --> 31:06.155
<i>My time or your time?</i>

31:06.281 --> 31:07.699
My time, of course.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.284
<i>Sounds good.</i>

31:09.701 --> 31:13.454
<i>Look, I'm due in a meeting,</i>
<i>but I'm really looking forward to Tuesday.</i>

31:14.038 --> 31:15.582
<i>You mind telling Ravi "thank you" for me?</i>

31:16.416 --> 31:17.417
She says "thank you."

31:19.043 --> 31:19.878
Bye, twin.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.337
<i>Bye, twin.</i>

31:23.506 --> 31:27.135
Well, someone is happy ugly crying
in her office right now.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.052
Ah.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.347
How do you think she'll feel
when you show up in person on Tuesday?

31:31.472 --> 31:33.308
A brick will dislodge in her colon.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.436
That's a vivid image.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.521
Yeah. It's not going to be pretty.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.773
I just got your text.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.735
Why are we
interviewing the brain thief here?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.194
It's a funny story.

31:45.361 --> 31:48.406
Unis show up to arrest
this Darren Caulley, and he bolts.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.159
They chase him,
but it's Fat Talbert and Donut Joe,

31:51.242 --> 31:53.828
so, of course, our perp is getting away,

31:53.912 --> 31:57.081
he turns around, flips 'em the bird and...
[laughing]

31:57.790 --> 31:59.584
-Bus hits him.
-Body cams?

31:59.876 --> 32:02.962
Oh, yeah. We'll pick up popcorn
on the way back to the station.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.756
-It gets better.
-It can't.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.842
Oh, yeah. His apartment is
full of stolen electronics.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.053
It's like a whole lotta larder in there.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.096
Man's having a bad day.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.766
-Let's go make it worse.
-Let's.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.563
Murder? You gotta be kidding.

32:20.730 --> 32:21.731
I'm a people person.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.442
When am I supposed to have committed
this murder?

32:24.817 --> 32:26.611
Early Tuesday, say, 1:00 a.m.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.655
You know where you were at that time?

32:28.905 --> 32:30.490
Oh, yeah.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.158
I was burgling.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.870
They probably have me on video
down at Electric Earl's.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.331
I'm in a red, white and blue stocking cap.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.668
All the loot's in my apartment.
I'm sure the serial numbers will match.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.170
Did you look at the busboy?

32:45.755 --> 32:47.715
Or maybe it was, uh, the dishwasher?

32:48.675 --> 32:51.761
She caught one of those guys
scarfing down brains out of a bus tray.

32:51.844 --> 32:55.014
[chuckles] I thought Eleanor was gonna
rip out that cat's spine.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.101
You realize
this is an easy alibi to check.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.019
Yeah. Do your thing.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.354
I'm not going anywhere.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.867
So, that's Peters? You got him?

33:14.951 --> 33:16.202
Yeah, but he's in bad shape.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.413
He ran from my squad
right into Mikey Fuze's flamethrower.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.206
-[Peters groaning]
-Nearly melted his face off.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.749
If we can get him stabilized
before he dies,

33:21.833 --> 33:23.459
he could have some interesting stories
to tell us.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.462
Why don't you get some rest?
We'll take care of him here.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.214
I'll let you know if he starts talking.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.091
Yeah. Rest sounds good.

33:34.429 --> 33:35.722
[classical music playing]

33:37.015 --> 33:39.600
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.227
-The côte de boeuf you ordered...
-Yes?

33:41.310 --> 33:43.855
Yes, we are out of the brain
béarnaise sauce that comes with.

33:43.938 --> 33:47.442
That came with yoga instructor brain.
That's the main reason that I came here.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.236
I need off the brain I'm on.
I need someone mellow.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.196
Okay. Okay, I've been there.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.782
That's not the only brain in the ocean.
Or on our list.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.409
Let's see here, um...

33:56.659 --> 33:58.286
We're serving a big wave surfer.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.330
Here's a good one.
Professor of statistics.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.542
Oh, no. This is the old list.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.295
These brains got stolen a few nights ago.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.255
Let me find you a current list.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.548
You know what?

34:10.840 --> 34:13.301
Some other time. I just solved a murder.

34:20.683 --> 34:21.601
Twelve beats per minute.

34:25.354 --> 34:27.482
All right, yes, I'm a zombie. What of it?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.735
But you're not registered.
You have no ID. Why is that?

34:31.569 --> 34:33.780
I don't enjoy queuing up for brains.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.990
Plus, it's safer to pass as human.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.826
Hiding my identity does not mean
I robbed the place.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.745
Rob all the places you want.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.372
-We solve homicides.
-[Jerry scoffs]

34:43.664 --> 34:45.541
I certainly didn't kill Chef.

34:45.666 --> 34:49.003
A witness says Chef yelled at you
for eating scraps at Le Dome.

34:49.087 --> 34:49.962
Brain scraps.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.090
She knew you were in the closet,
didn't she?

34:52.590 --> 34:54.092
[Clive] Isn't it true, Jerry,

34:54.258 --> 34:56.886
that if a boat's got two masts,
it's a yawl?

34:57.595 --> 34:59.472
Or a ketch. It actually depends

34:59.597 --> 35:02.100
on the position of the mast
relative to the rudder post.

35:03.601 --> 35:07.438
The Queen Anne Yacht Club's president
was on the menu at Le Dome last week.

35:07.563 --> 35:12.026
Last time we saw you, you told us
how many kilos were in 34.5 pounds.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.861
Can you remind us how much that is?

35:14.779 --> 35:15.613
I...

35:17.281 --> 35:18.574
[chuckles nervously] Well...

35:18.658 --> 35:19.492
Huh.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.828
You were so quick with the math last week.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.079
Now, nothing?

35:23.788 --> 35:27.083
That must be because he was
on statistician brain.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.460
Also on Le Dome's menu last week.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.004
Where did you get those brains, Jerr?

35:32.463 --> 35:35.133
Because those brains were stolen
by the thief who killed Chef.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.306
My mom and dad are both CHICS.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.811
Eleanor found out I'm closeted
and lorded it over me.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.272
She made my life a living hell.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.525
She caught me stealing brains
the other night.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.820
She was going to fire me,
out me to my parents.

35:56.612 --> 35:59.532
[voice breaking] I panicked, and I hit her
with the first thing handy, and then--

35:59.824 --> 36:00.825
The cling wrap?

36:03.536 --> 36:04.829
Jerry Halloway,

36:06.372 --> 36:09.500
you're under arrest
for the murder of Eleanor Hickmott.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.045
-[heart monitor beeping]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

36:14.672 --> 36:15.673
[Ames] Between me and you,

36:17.008 --> 36:18.718
I'm not surprised about Peters.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.137
Always thought there was
somethin' off about that guy.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.056
You hungry, Ames?

36:24.849 --> 36:25.683
No, I'm good.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.602
I'm starving.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.063
Mind running to the commissary,
picking me up a couple tubes?

36:31.731 --> 36:32.607
Of course, sir.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.626
[Hobbs] Maybe... Maybe Peters is a liar.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.296
Don't lose faith.

36:57.882 --> 36:58.966
Too late.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.179
[sighs]

37:04.889 --> 37:07.058
You really should've stayed gone, Peters.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.685
You picked the wrong team, brother.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.481
[gun cocks]

37:15.441 --> 37:17.568
I'm thinking
maybe you picked the wrong team, brother.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.125
Look, Major.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.754
I love you. I do.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.757
I tried to support you,
but you took it too far.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.885
You were willing to sacrifice
zombies for humans.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.931
How could you be so naive? You, Liv...

37:47.431 --> 37:51.018
There is no middle ground, Major.
It's us or them.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.728
It's time to pick sides.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.815
You're a zombie.
I recommend you get on board the team.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.233
I picked a side.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.777
Good humans, good zombies, side-by-side.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.404
That's not a side!

38:01.737 --> 38:03.990
That's blowing out a candle
and making a wish!

38:06.075 --> 38:07.493
I trusted you, Justin.

38:09.912 --> 38:10.746
Cuff him.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.588
[Justin] Everyone stay back!

38:21.966 --> 38:25.594
I'm sorry, Major. You're a good guy,
but the wrong guy for bad times.

38:26.929 --> 38:27.930
You're soft,

38:28.764 --> 38:29.932
you don't have the nerve to--

38:30.016 --> 38:31.017
[groans]

38:31.684 --> 38:32.727
[thuds]

38:37.523 --> 38:38.607
Clean this up.
