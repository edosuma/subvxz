to let love in,

07:28.796 --> 07:30.275
Kim showed her true colors.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.929
The girl is a yellow?

07:31.973 --> 07:33.409
Kim's a honey trap.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.106
She's working for
the yellow team

07:35.150 --> 07:36.325
to compromise
the blue team's

07:36.368 --> 07:38.066
strongest,
most handsome asset.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.981
You really think so?
The girl invited me

07:40.024 --> 07:42.287
to a movie about spies.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.376
How much more obvious
could a spy be?

07:44.420 --> 07:45.813
That makes perfect sense.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.119
MATT: Or maybe Kim's
a genuine, sincere person

07:48.163 --> 07:49.643
who really likes you!

07:49.686 --> 07:51.993
Nice try,
closet Matt Bradley!

07:52.036 --> 07:54.952
All I'm saying is
maybe you don't want
to go out with Kim

07:54.996 --> 07:56.954
'cause your heart
still beats for Lainey.

07:56.998 --> 08:00.305
Your yellow opinions
are not welcome
in this blue house.

08:00.349 --> 08:03.091
Blue JTP
minus Matt Bradley!

08:03.134 --> 08:04.571
Blue JTP minus Matt Bradley!
Blue JTP minus Matt Bradley!

08:04.614 --> 08:05.702
Whoo!

08:05.746 --> 08:07.530
MATT: [GROANS]
I hate Color Day!

08:09.053 --> 08:11.142
Boopie, it's almost dinner.
Can you clean all this up?

08:11.186 --> 08:14.102
Sorry. I needed the space
to sort out
all my applications.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.407
Applications?

08:15.451 --> 08:16.974
Did someone say
"applications"?

08:17.018 --> 08:19.194
Please tell me
you're filling out
applications!

08:19.237 --> 08:21.457
I really am.
And it's all thanks to Mom.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.634
Oh! Your dumb idea worked!
Look at you!

08:24.678 --> 08:26.680
Say the words, Murray.
Say, "Mama fixed it."

08:26.723 --> 08:28.159
I'll say anything you want

08:28.203 --> 08:31.249
because my baby's applying
to Tic Tac Dough.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.642
What the [BLEEP] is this?

08:32.686 --> 08:35.427
Don't worry. Tic Tac Dough
is just my safety show.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.647
My dream is to get accepted
into Jeopardy!

08:37.691 --> 08:39.693
That's what this is about,
game shows?

08:39.736 --> 08:42.304
Mom reminded me of the smart,
confident girl I used to be,

08:42.347 --> 08:44.132
which is why
I'm applying

08:44.175 --> 08:46.613
to all the top game shows
in the country.Game shows?

08:46.656 --> 08:48.876
Sadly, I got wait-listed
for Win, Lose or Draw,

08:48.919 --> 08:51.226
but Wheel of Fortune
has rolling admissions.Game shows.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.923
I'm sorry,
this is your plan?

08:52.967 --> 08:54.272
Well, I'm weighing
my options.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.405
I know it'll be cheaper
if I go to Finders Keepers,

08:56.448 --> 08:57.667
which shoots in Philly.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.669
But I always envisioned myself
going out of state.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.802
Game shows, Bevy!
Game shows!

09:01.845 --> 09:04.239
At the very least, I can go
to Let's Make a Deal.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.458
Anyone with a costume
can get in there.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.765
Although, their program
won't really challenge me
like Jeopardy!

09:08.809 --> 09:11.202
Wish me luck.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.769
Game shows?

09:12.813 --> 09:15.206
Just calm down. Trust me.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.992
Erica will find that
college is the only answer

09:18.035 --> 09:20.429
when she can't get on
to any of these silly shows.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.604
You mean game shows?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.432
Stop saying "game shows."

09:23.475 --> 09:25.565
It's fine.
Mama will fix this.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.567
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

09:27.610 --> 09:29.743
Jeopardy!just called,
and they want me to come in
for an interview!

09:29.786 --> 09:31.483
Yeah, Mama didn't fix it.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.878
ADULT ADAM:
Erica had been accepted

09:34.922 --> 09:36.271
into the prestigious
Jeopardy! tryouts,

09:36.314 --> 09:38.795
and she was taking
the opportunity
very seriously.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.231
What is a Frisbee?

09:40.275 --> 09:41.319
What is a Frisbee?
ALEX: Right.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.495
Beat ya, Larry. [CRUNCHING]

09:43.539 --> 09:45.193
Hey, I'm in training here!

09:45.236 --> 09:46.803
Don't care.
This ends now.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.544
Welcome to Dad
fixing your life.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.980
Hello?
Did you not hear about

09:50.024 --> 09:51.591
my super-well-thought-out
game-show plan?

09:51.634 --> 09:52.983
Well, here's my plan.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.246
Step one,
get off your butt.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.421
Step two,
go to college.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.553
Plan over. Fixed.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.207
Murray, I told you
not to mix in.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.643
I'm handling it.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.471
There you go, Mom.
Control your man.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.299
Please just do step one!

10:04.342 --> 10:05.561
Get off my couch!

10:05.605 --> 10:07.476
[STUTTERS] I think
what Daddy's trying to say

10:07.519 --> 10:09.696
is, um, maybe Jeopardy!

10:09.739 --> 10:12.176
isn't actually doing something
with your life.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.005
Duh. I know I can't only live
off winning Jeopardy!

10:15.049 --> 10:16.616
That's why I have
a whole plan worked out.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.313
[LAUGHING]
Oh, thank you, Lord!

10:18.356 --> 10:19.880
She has a plan, Murray!

10:19.923 --> 10:21.011
What is your plan?
Tell us your plan.[CHUCKLES]

10:21.055 --> 10:22.752
Your firstborn baby

10:22.796 --> 10:25.755
is going to be a professional
game-show contestant.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.019
Professional what now?

10:29.063 --> 10:32.066
Starting now, I'm gonna do
game shows full time.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.937
That's not a plan, Erica!

10:33.981 --> 10:35.547
Whoa!
Where is this coming from?

10:35.591 --> 10:37.375
This whole thing
was your idea.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.203
When I called you
my little genius,

10:39.247 --> 10:41.162
I meant go to college.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.729
Oh, so it's like that, huh?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.948
It's not like that.
It is that.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.254
Well, you know what?

10:46.297 --> 10:47.734
When I win on
Price is Right,

10:47.777 --> 10:50.084
I'm not sharing
any of my cash or prizes

10:50.127 --> 10:51.302
from the Showcase Showdown.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.564
And you know
what else?

10:52.608 --> 10:55.480
I'm gonna go on Family Feud
all by myself.

10:55.524 --> 10:59.397
Oh, please! We all know
you need us for that game.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.922
I'll just tell them
I'm an orphan and win it
all on my own.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.054
Don't you dare!
I got it.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.753
If you go on Family Feud
without your beloved family,

11:06.796 --> 11:08.798
then that is
the ultimate betrayal!

11:08.842 --> 11:11.018
Do not cry.
Oh, it's happening.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.760
And when I get my creepy kiss
from Richard Dawson,

11:13.803 --> 11:15.631
you will be nowhere
in sight!

11:15.675 --> 11:18.286
She's threatening to go on
Family Feudby herself!

11:18.329 --> 11:19.940
She's gone too far.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.116
You and I are upset
about different things.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.639
ADULT ADAM:
As my parents went to war

11:23.683 --> 11:25.162
with their game-show-loving
daughter,

11:25.206 --> 11:28.513
Barry was still convinced Kim was a secret Color Day spy.

11:28.557 --> 11:29.993
Uh, Kim?

11:30.037 --> 11:31.386
Yeah?
Hello.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.344
I have
some unfortunate news

11:33.388 --> 11:36.130
regarding your
forthcoming movie date
with Barry Goldberg.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.435
Oh, no.
Is he not coming?

11:37.479 --> 11:40.003
The answers to your questions
are all in this secret message

11:40.047 --> 11:42.745
he asked me to smuggle to you
somewhere inside of myself.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.747
But, yeah,
I didn't do that, so here.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.793
KIM: "Dear Kim,

11:46.836 --> 11:48.620
"Clearly your interest in me
is a mere ploy

11:48.664 --> 11:51.101
"to keep me
from leading the blue team
to Color Day victory.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.973
"Your sinister plan
has failed.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.323
"Eat blue farts, witch."

11:55.366 --> 11:57.934
Is this a joke?
Sadly, it's more
of a blunt rejection

11:57.978 --> 12:00.763
contained in a wildly paranoid
and hostile letter.

12:00.807 --> 12:04.158
"Yellow is only good
for one thing.
Being on bananas.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.726
"Ha ha ha. You suck.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.205
"Fondly, Barry."

12:08.249 --> 12:10.817
If you wouldn't mind,
I'm gonna need the note back.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.209
Barry insisted
that I eat it.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.298
This is all about
Color Day?

12:14.342 --> 12:15.691
[VOICE BREAKING] I don't
even care about that stuff.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.258
You know what?

12:17.301 --> 12:20.043
Just go ahead
and throw the note away
at your convenience.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.393
Trust me, bro.
I don't think Kim's a spy.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.569
Of course she is.
When she read your note,

12:24.613 --> 12:27.268
she immediately had tears
of sadness and rage.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.618
Ugh, right.
That Kim's a tough cookie.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.620
But I literally eat cookies
for breakfast.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.231
Um, Bar,
it's pretty clear

12:34.275 --> 12:35.842
you're just pushing Kim away
with crazy conspiracies

12:35.885 --> 12:37.147
'cause you're still
not over Lainey.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.628
Stop trying
to get inside my head,

12:39.671 --> 12:41.325
mortal enemy Matt Bradley!

12:41.369 --> 12:43.937
Just go back to eating lunch
with your yellow best friends.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.069
They're not my best friends.
They're sixth graders.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.593
Dude, Matt's right.
This girl's into you.

12:48.637 --> 12:52.597
Oh, man.
How'd I not see this?

12:52.641 --> 12:54.469
You're working
for them, too!

12:54.512 --> 12:55.644
[EXCLAIMS] What? Come on!

12:55.687 --> 12:57.559
Matt Bradley got to you.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.868
sent here to make sure
we lose Color Day.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.087
Have you ever
known me to care about

13:04.131 --> 13:06.655
an athletic competition
at any time?

13:06.698 --> 13:09.440
Maybe you've been faking
a dislike of sports

13:09.484 --> 13:10.746
your whole life,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.704
knowing this moment
would come!

13:12.748 --> 13:14.576
Maybe you're
the greatest athlete

13:14.619 --> 13:16.491
this school
has ever seen!

13:16.534 --> 13:18.885
Look at my lazy eye,
dude!

13:18.928 --> 13:21.278
I have
no depth perception!
None!

13:21.322 --> 13:23.106
Or do you?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.892
[GROANS]
I'm pretty sure he's not
athletic in any way, dude.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.546
Oh, no. They got
to Naked Rob, too!

While Barry's sanity
was in jeopardy,

a single interview away

13:42.299 --> 13:43.910

Big congrats on
making it this far.

Now we just need to
get to know you a bit better.

So, tell me what you've
been up to in the last year.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.527
Me? Oh, man.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.224
[CHUCKLES]
So much stuff.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.791
Okay.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.315
Care to elaborate
on the stuff?

13:58.359 --> 14:01.231
As of late, I have been
trying out for Jeopardy!

14:01.275 --> 14:03.973
Trying out for Jeopardy!
can't really be
a talking point

14:04.017 --> 14:05.757
for someone trying out
for Jeopardy!

14:05.801 --> 14:08.195
Very fair.
The last lady
I interviewed,

14:08.238 --> 14:11.067
she's an ornithologist,
and she makes
her own lavender soap.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.503
Ooh, I use soap.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.244
Big soap gal
right here.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.029
Well, we already
got a soap gal,

14:16.072 --> 14:18.379
and she doesn't just use it.
She makes it.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.816
You get me?
God, yes, I get you.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.992
Look,
I dropped out of school

14:23.036 --> 14:24.515
so that I could
follow my dreams.

14:24.559 --> 14:25.995
And then it was,
like, super hard.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.911
And now I have no job
and no degree
and no prospects.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.000
I had to borrow this suit
from my mom.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.089
And you know how
I said I use soap?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.961
At best,
I shower twice a week,

14:35.004 --> 14:37.441
'cause it's like,
what's the point?

14:37.485 --> 14:40.009
Just, please, you got to
put me on Jeopardy!,bro.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.098
I'd say maybe try
Tic-Tac-Dough.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.018
What's this?
A message from Barry.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.933
It's written in code,
but the code is wrong.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.152
Just meet him
in the gym.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.549
BARRY: Leave it dark.

14:58.593 --> 14:59.986
No one
on the blue team

15:00.029 --> 15:01.901

with the enemy.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.206
Okey-dokey.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.079

Oh. Seriously?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.865

a lot of guff

15:09.909 --> 15:11.867

being a good leader.

your little toes.

Which is why I need you
to tell me

15:48.599 --> 15:50.036
will I ever
get over Lainey?

15:50.079 --> 15:52.212
I know losing Lainey
broke your heart,

your heart won't heal.

to the senior class event.

that would go down
in William Penn history,

took the easy win.

by dividing us,

but in the end,
it brought us all together.

I could be someone,

was I'm a mess.
