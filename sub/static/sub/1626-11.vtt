00:08.976 --> 00:11.043
To the pastry school

00:11.045 --> 00:12.444
I mean, I'm not wearing
a bra

00:12.446 --> 00:15.214
And my thong may be
on backwards.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.949
There's no wrong way
to wear a thong,

00:16.951 --> 00:19.284
As long
as it's uncomfortable.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.153
And with you, the bra's
just for decoration.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.788
I have to wear one
'cause you get a ticket

00:22.790 --> 00:25.024
For not putting the kids
in a car seat.

00:26.659 --> 00:27.993
See you in class, guys.

00:27.995 --> 00:32.197
I gotta say good-bye
to my wife.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.633
Did you think
I was gonna kiss you?

00:34.635 --> 00:37.069
Yes. I'm the wife,
you're the husband,

00:37.071 --> 00:38.303
Who I caught wearing
my clothes one day,

00:38.305 --> 00:39.805
But I don't say
anything about it.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.373
Morning, guys.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.641
Oh, hi, bebe.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.376
Surprised to see me, right?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.978
Everyone always thinks
I'm not gonna make it

00:45.980 --> 00:47.379
Through the night,
but here I am,

00:47.381 --> 00:50.482
Even surprised myself.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.251
What's it like working
in an office

00:52.253 --> 00:55.320
With someone who's about
to snap like a breadstick?

00:55.322 --> 00:58.824
Not as much fun
as you'd think.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.592
But bebe's sweet,
and working here

01:00.594 --> 01:01.994
Is putting you
through pastry school.

01:01.996 --> 01:02.995
Okay, bye.
Bye.

I'd have sex with him,

You still have a nanny?

I mean, she didn't
take care of me,

02:28.782 --> 02:30.082
But when I was a kid,
she used to let me

02:30.084 --> 02:32.484
Drink out of her hose.

The last time I saw antonia,

That's a shame.

My nanny died.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.042
She was like a mother to me.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.344
But she was not your mother.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.012
And diner rules clearly state

You can only take off for

it's important

04:19.860 --> 04:21.393
To honor the elderly.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.195
I shared a bunk bed

Oh, no.

I was so heartbroken,
I could barely eat her.

You ate your dead nanny?

It doesn't matter
what you name it.

05:17.351 --> 05:21.320
It's still good goat meat.

All right,
I'll be in my booth.

Wait, how are
we gonna get there?

05:31.165 --> 05:33.498
Oh, bebe said she had a car,
we can just ask her.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
I don't want to get
in a car with her.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.969
I don't even want to get in
a conversation with her.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.271
I can drive you.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.806
We just have to stop
at my sister's

In bucks county,
pick up an unmarked package,

Oleg, is there anything illegal
about this delivery?

05:49.450 --> 05:50.949
No, it's just some shoes...

Stuffed with cocaine.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.688
Also the shoes are made
of hashish.

cheesesteak place.

In fact, I only know her
as the lady who brought me

And cheesesteaks together.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.917
Even though we've never met,
it'll mean so much

To antonia's family
that I came out of respect.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.455
It'll mean so much
to my therapist

07:03.457 --> 07:04.389
That I left my safe zone

07:04.391 --> 07:06.858
And only brought one
of the dogs.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.361
Max, do you think
in addition to my eulogy,

07:09.363 --> 07:11.630
I should read something
from my childhood journal?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.132

gonna do it anyway.

still no movement.

I never had
a Halloween costume.

in a messy bun

07:53.440 --> 07:54.439
And stumble
from door-to-door

07:54.441 --> 07:56.675
Telling people
I was my mother.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.478
This Halloween, I went
as my doctor, michael.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.279
And I dressed up
my buddy here

08:01.281 --> 08:03.648
As his lover, joseph.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.485
We lost.

Antonia was always there
for me--

08:08.422 --> 08:10.655
Halloween, christmas, easter--
every holiday.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.324
Really, every day.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.359
She was really like
a mother to me.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.094
Where was your real mother?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.128
Hey, what kind of dog
is that?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.630
I mean, besides "sad"?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.499
Her mother had an affair,
got pushed out.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.502
That's her hot spot,
so don't lick it.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.371
It's okay, max,
I don't need any protection.

You don't need protection?

Who are you,

Bebe, yes, my mother
was unfaithful

08:31.545 --> 08:33.512
To my father,
so she was sent away.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.614
But I had antonia
and she took care of me.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.516
She was my family.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.518
That must have been hard.
Everybody needs a mother.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.953
I'd be crazy
without my mother.

She drives me to
all my appointments.

But you drive.

Yeah...

But I'm not supposed to.

It's okay I asked bebe
to wait in the car, right?

08:59.406 --> 09:02.040
I mean, she'll be okay.
We cracked a window.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.576
Yeah, and she's got
a bowl and a chew-toy.

when I meet the family.

I can't be all emotional.

Look, my hand's shaking.
This is terrible.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.094
What? It was
a terrible signature.

other names on the page.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.187
You told me
not to mention it anymore,

09:49.189 --> 09:50.889
So it's just a reminder.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.725
Okay, max, there are gonna
be a lot of people

09:53.727 --> 09:55.927
Who will want my attention,
so please be patient

09:55.929 --> 09:58.096
And stand next to me for
the occasional supportive lean.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.197
And if someone starts
to get too weepy,

09:59.199 --> 10:00.599
Push them out of the way

10:00.601 --> 10:01.733
Because I can't get tears
on this dress.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.269
It has to be back
to barneys by 9:00 a.M.

10:05.471 --> 10:06.571
You're here.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.607
Here we go, max.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.542
[crying]

10:12.712 --> 10:15.680
I was talking to him.

10:20.219 --> 10:23.154
Of course you were.
It's a very sad day for us all.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.960
That was rough.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.099
Oh.
Max, look.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.333
This is antonia.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.502
Wow.
She looks really nice.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.903
She was.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.939
I didn't know
she was in the military.

10:40.941 --> 10:44.743
But it does explain those
fabulous bed sheet corners.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.312
Wait, you didn't know
your nanny was a marine?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.747
That's too bad,
'cause I'd be all,

10:48.749 --> 10:49.814
"yo, other little rich kid!

10:49.816 --> 10:52.651
My nanny can snap your neck."

10:52.653 --> 10:56.788
Oh, look. There are
her sisters, cecelia and angela,

10:56.790 --> 10:58.823
And there are
her nieces and nephews.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.994
And there is not me anywhere.

11:02.996 --> 11:03.995
You know, my picture must be
in the coffin

11:03.997 --> 11:08.433
With the other v.I.P.S.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.302
If you're a v.I.P.,
can we get some bottle service?

11:11.304 --> 11:12.671
Good afternoon, ladies.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.140
I'm anthony,
antonia's nephew.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.875
It's sad day, huh?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.109
Yes, it is.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.711
Oh.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.212
Think I just got
a little less sad.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.148
[gasps]
oh! Anthony!

11:23.150 --> 11:25.450
Stop.
We're family.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.152
I'm caroline channing.

11:27.154 --> 11:31.356
You're caroline "hot,"
is all I know.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.791
You ladies need
cash envelopes

11:32.793 --> 11:33.658
Or you guys cool?

11:33.660 --> 11:37.495
I always need
a cash envelope.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.698
I'm sorry,
envelopes for what?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.800
Well, at italian wakes,
the mourners give the family

11:41.802 --> 11:44.069
A donation after
they view the deceased.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.504
So it's pay-per-view?

11:46.506 --> 11:49.641
That was a good one.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.876
Hey, you want to go get
a pop later?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.713
We're leaving right after,
but yes, anthony.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.848
Thank you.
We'll take an envelope.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.183
All right.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.552
The body's right
through there.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.754
Go right ahead.
Right through.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.689
Anthony, stop.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.057
I'm really nervous.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.859
I've never seen
a dead body before.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.060
I've seen a bunch.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.063
A couple of them
were my fault.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.698
I don't have any cash.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.001
Do you have any money?
Let me check my wallet.

12:17.003 --> 12:21.005
This is a real ziploc,
not one of those knock-offs.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.609
Make sure you seal
the envelope,

12:24.611 --> 12:27.045
So people think
it's all quarters.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.580
Max, we're next.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.014
I'm afraid.
Hold my hand.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.583
Hold hands?
What are we?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.686
On a christian mingle
fifth date?

12:35.888 --> 12:37.589
Please, max.
I'm nervous.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.524
Oh, god.
Thank you.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.259
Okay. Now give it back.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.729
What? That was just
my longest relationship.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.599
Plus, I need it to put
this change in the envelope.

12:49.902 --> 12:53.605
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

12:53.607 --> 12:57.742
Hi, antonia.
It's me, caroline.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.911
Should I kiss her? The family
is right there watching.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.746
The lady before us
kissed her.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.214
Go for it.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.717
Doesn't look like
she'd fight you.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.719
Okay, on the count of three.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.587
One, two--

13:09.589 --> 13:11.089
No! Max, hold my hand again
while I--

13:11.091 --> 13:13.158
[coins clatter]

13:14.994 --> 13:16.928
What do we do?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.764
Wait, leave it! We were
giving it to them anyway.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.400
Not all of it.
That's our cheesesteak money.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.736
Leave it. Come on.

13:24.738 --> 13:27.739
I am so, so sorry
about that.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.108
My nerves got the best of me.
You understand.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.143
I'm cecelia, antonia's--

13:32.145 --> 13:33.144
Sister. I know.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.612
I see the resemblance.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.749
I'm caroline.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.819
Caroline who?

13:40.821 --> 13:43.087
Oh. Caroline channing.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.593
Caroline channing who?

13:48.595 --> 13:51.262
You're having a hard time
processing. Understandable.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.531
It's been a very emotional day
for us all.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.933
Who is this girl?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.869
You, I feel like
I've seen somewhere.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.971
Are you ricky's girl

13:59.973 --> 14:01.339
From rochester?

14:01.341 --> 14:05.877
I could be.
What's in it for me?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.513
Antonia used to take care
of me when I was little.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.783
Oh, antonia was
your baby-sitter.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.818
Very nice of you to come.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.454
Well, she was hardly
my "baby-sitter."

14:16.456 --> 14:19.123
She took care of me
every day for ten years.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.860
Caroline.
Caroline channing.

14:21.862 --> 14:25.730
I'm sorry, but I don't
know who you are, sweetheart,

14:25.732 --> 14:30.468
Though it seems to be
what you're hammering me about.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.904
If you'll excuse me,

14:32.906 --> 14:34.172
I need a cigarette.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.874
And then I got to remove

14:35.876 --> 14:38.142
Some of those pennies
off of my sister.

14:38.144 --> 14:42.247
It's a coffin,
not a wishing well.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.115
<i>Marone.</i>

14:49.922 --> 14:53.491
This funeral turned out
to be very depressing.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.859
Well, yeah.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.695
Dead body in the room,
generally a buzz-kill.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.163
Unless it's an irish wake--

14:59.165 --> 15:02.267
Then you're playing beer pong
off the coffin.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.935
No, I mean,
how is it possible

15:03.937 --> 15:05.870
That the family doesn't
even know me?

15:05.872 --> 15:08.072
Did antonia never
even mention me?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.707
Let's focus on the positive.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.210
Anthony really liked
your ass.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.679
I know what
antonia and I had.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.281
This is what we had.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.515
Peep, peep.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.050
That's what we had.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.852
Well, that's a lot.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.253
But I guess no one
in this family

15:22.255 --> 15:24.255
Wants to admit that,
and it's a shame too,

15:24.257 --> 15:26.224
Because I had a great eulogy.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.792
You do?

15:27.794 --> 15:29.060
Yes. I do.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.695
Would you like me
to share it with you?

15:30.697 --> 15:33.031
I most certainly would.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.733
You are not seriously
eulogy-bombing

15:35.735 --> 15:37.035
That old lady, are you?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.871
She asked me about
my great eulogy.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.539
She's a hundred.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.876
She probably thought you said
you had a great urologist.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.077
Do you have a pen?

15:46.079 --> 15:50.048
I'm getting the name
of her doctor.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.550
No, ma'am, I didn't say,
"urologist."

15:52.552 --> 15:55.119
I said, "eulogy."
a great eulogy.

15:55.121 --> 15:58.923
Why would you give
the eulogy?

15:58.925 --> 16:02.226
Because I'm caroline channing.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.795
Who?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.997
Caroline channing.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.899
Caroline channing.

16:07.901 --> 16:10.134
Antonia was my nanny.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.602
My family was rich,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.438
But then my father robbed
everyone,

16:13.440 --> 16:15.940
And we became
the scourge of society,

16:15.942 --> 16:17.809
Overshadowed
a little bit by mel gibson

16:17.811 --> 16:18.977
Hating the jews
that same week.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.946
Surely, you remember?

16:21.948 --> 16:27.251
Honey, I don't even remember
how I got here.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.456
I can't believe this.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.025
I constructed my entire
"happy" childhood

16:34.027 --> 16:35.793
On the fact that
even though my mom left

16:35.795 --> 16:37.161
And apparently didn't love me,

16:37.163 --> 16:38.997
Antonia did.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.431
And now I get here
and I realize

16:40.433 --> 16:42.834
No one loved me,
I was just a paycheck.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.936
One of the many kids
she baby-sat.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.871
I don't even know
why I bothered to come.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.407
I'm going to the restroom
and then we can just leave.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.646
Excuse me. Hi.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.049
Max, ricky's girl.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.785
[clears throat] I know this
is a hard time for you,

17:00.787 --> 17:02.854
But it's a hard time
for my friend as well.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.322
And even though
you never heard of her,

17:04.324 --> 17:06.290
I was wondering if
you could just go over there,

17:06.292 --> 17:07.792
And say you just
remembered her,

17:07.794 --> 17:09.794
And that antonia talked
about her all the time?

17:09.796 --> 17:14.032
I know it's a 180 on your
original story and a lie,

17:14.034 --> 17:15.500
And I'd offer to pay you
for your trouble,

17:15.502 --> 17:17.368
But my 401k is laying
in that box

17:17.370 --> 17:19.504
On top of your sister.

17:19.506 --> 17:24.142
Look, I only permitted
you two to stay

17:24.144 --> 17:27.178
'cause your ricky was so nice
to uncle joe

17:27.180 --> 17:30.381
When he fell off the roof
last year.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.251
But now, you gotta go.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.687
Okay.
Be that way.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.356
But don't expect ricky
to pick up

17:38.358 --> 17:40.058
Uncle joe for dialysis.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.599
Max, what are you doing?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.068
The family asked me
to put it up.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.903
They just remembered you.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.071
Oh, my god.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.906
I'm so pathetic,
you have to put up

17:54.908 --> 17:56.874
My picture
to make me feel better?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.444
In a way, yes.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.245
It belongs up there.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.848
Who wouldn't want
to know that kid?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.116
Nice to meet you, antonia.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.452
Please don't haunt us.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.387
Now, let's hit the road and
get some freaking cheesesteaks!

18:09.389 --> 18:11.222
Max, please take
that down.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.623
It's so embarrassing.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.026
Nobody here knows
anything about me.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.228
They didn't know me either,
chicken.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.030
Hey, who you callin' chicken?

18:19.032 --> 18:22.266
Me. That was
antonia's nickname for me.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.868
You know who I am?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.236
Of course I do.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.872
Antonia's little chick,
her peep.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.074
She loved you.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.077
And she loved making you
that costume.

18:33.079 --> 18:37.048
Took the whole kitchen table up
with all those sequins,

18:37.050 --> 18:40.051
But she knew you deserved
to sparkle.

18:40.053 --> 18:44.222
She loved you so much,
I couldn't begin to complain.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.491
I'm so sorry.
What was your name?

18:46.493 --> 18:49.093
I'm meg o'hara.
I was her roommate.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.729
And lover.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.898
We were together 30 years.

18:55.167 --> 18:59.237
Both: The military!

19:02.808 --> 19:06.177
I know, right?
I mean, come on.

19:06.179 --> 19:10.248
That's me with my arm
around her on that tank.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.851
And the family still
had no clue.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.455
Vintage lez--
very cool.

19:17.457 --> 19:21.225
I know toni would have
wanted you to have these.

19:22.461 --> 19:26.297
Oh, thanks for coming,
chicken.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.167
You're probably
the only person in the world

19:29.169 --> 19:32.236
Who loved her
as purely as I did.

19:37.643 --> 19:40.211
Max, look.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.779
Christmas.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.981
And my birthday.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.051
And the teen choice awards.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.558
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:56.295 --> 19:59.463
Thank you.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.237
Philly cheesesteaks
for everybody!

20:06.239 --> 20:08.072
And you really haven't
lived

20:08.074 --> 20:09.507
Until you've driven
two hours in a chevy

20:09.509 --> 20:12.176
With nine cheesesteaks
and a gassy animal.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.879
What? I ate mine
in the car.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.014
Hey, earl, you missed
one hell of a funeral.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.349
You should have come.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.650
There were some hot
octogenarians,

20:19.652 --> 20:20.685
And I got a definite
"jungle fever" vibe

20:20.687 --> 20:22.253
From one of them.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.688
Girl, at my age,
you don't go

20:23.690 --> 20:25.256
Anywhere near funerals.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.858
You accidentally doze off,
you spend six hours

20:27.860 --> 20:30.127
Digging yourself
out of the ground.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.234
Hey, how you holding up,
chicken?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.535
I'm okay. Thanks.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.270
And max, when I die,

20:39.272 --> 20:40.938
I don't care who else
is at my funeral,

20:40.940 --> 20:42.240
As long as you're there.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.041
Of course I'll be there.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.711
The murderer always shows up
to throw off the cops.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.613
Also, save the money
on a casket

20:48.615 --> 20:51.249
And just toss me in a hole
wearing dior and a smoky eye.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.784
Unless I'm fat--
then burn me.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.419
Well, I don't want
a funeral.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.722
When I die, just shove
my corpse into a cannon

20:57.724 --> 21:00.358
And blow me directly
into the trump casino.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.998
