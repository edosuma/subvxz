08:37.746 --> 08:38.662
You think Lincoln would want

08:38.746 --> 08:39.830
one of these for his birthday?

08:39.914 --> 08:41.865
Probably not, 'cause he
doesn't have any hair.

08:41.951 --> 08:43.332
(Clicking tongue) Ugh, right.

08:43.419 --> 08:44.368
- Right?
- Right, right, right.

08:44.453 --> 08:45.919
- Yeah. Hmm.
- Yep, you're right.

08:45.955 --> 08:46.920
You know what? Follow me.

08:46.956 --> 08:48.121
We'll check out the ravioli attachments

08:48.207 --> 08:49.373
for his pasta maker.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.925
Lincoln has a pasta maker? No way.

08:51.961 --> 08:52.960
Yeah, you don't know about this?

08:53.012 --> 08:54.044
The homemade pasta.

08:54.129 --> 08:55.629
He makes a different
kind every Sunday night.

08:55.714 --> 08:56.763
It's on his blog.

08:56.799 --> 08:57.864
What blog?

08:57.933 --> 08:59.716
"The Al Dente Dentist."

08:59.802 --> 09:01.351
Do you not talk to Lincoln?

09:01.437 --> 09:03.020
It should be called "The Al Dentist."

09:03.105 --> 09:04.187
No, we don't...

09:04.273 --> 09:05.722
we don't talk. We hook up,

09:05.808 --> 09:06.773
I smoke him up, we watch TV.

09:06.809 --> 09:07.724
It's great.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.226
Abbi!

09:09.376 --> 09:12.177
You come here, you don't
come find me in flatware?

09:12.212 --> 09:14.012
Come on! Oh, ho, ho, ho!

09:14.048 --> 09:15.013
Wow!

09:15.049 --> 09:16.181
(Both) Hmm.

09:16.216 --> 09:18.633
Here we go. This is it.

09:18.719 --> 09:20.385
Whew!

09:20.471 --> 09:21.887
Yes.

09:21.939 --> 09:24.139
Whoo! Right.

09:24.224 --> 09:26.358
- Blam! (Scatting)
- I'm just gonna...

09:28.395 --> 09:29.561
Oh, my God.

09:29.646 --> 09:31.146
Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.650
All right. Thank you, guys.

09:35.736 --> 09:37.235
Thank you so much.

09:37.287 --> 09:39.371
- Whoa!
- Oh, ho, ho!

09:39.406 --> 09:41.790
- Holler at me, Abbi!
- (Laughing)

09:42.993 --> 09:44.042
- Good to see you, Abbi.
- Oh, I'll see you.

09:44.078 --> 09:45.127
How often do you come in here?

09:45.212 --> 09:46.411
Not that much.

09:46.497 --> 09:48.080
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

09:48.132 --> 09:49.548
- Hey.
- All right.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.133
Oh, my God.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.087
The planning this takes is unbelievable.

09:55.172 --> 09:56.588
- This is incredible.
- What's going on?

09:56.640 --> 09:58.256
Oh, my God, she doesn't do dances with me.

09:58.308 --> 09:59.558
(Both laughing)

09:59.593 --> 10:01.259
- Hi, pretty lady!
- What's up?

10:01.311 --> 10:02.561
- What is up?
- Oh, look...

10:02.596 --> 10:03.729
- Okay.
- You know what?

10:03.764 --> 10:04.679
I've got a cutting board
with your name on it.

10:04.765 --> 10:05.931
- Stunning.
- No!

10:05.983 --> 10:06.932
No, really, I've been
calling it "the Abbi."

10:06.984 --> 10:07.849
- Great.
- Oh!

10:07.935 --> 10:09.484
You go do that.

10:09.570 --> 10:11.269
I will get an air conditioner.

10:11.321 --> 10:13.655
Meet you back on the thing.

10:15.242 --> 10:16.274
- This feels great.
- It is so good.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.943
It's an investment, you know? Right?

10:17.995 --> 10:19.444
I'll look for a cab on the side streets,

10:19.530 --> 10:20.529
you take the avenue.

10:20.614 --> 10:22.164
- Genius. All angles.
- Whoo!

10:24.451 --> 10:25.534
Come on, New York!

10:26.954 --> 10:29.838
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Brb!

10:29.923 --> 10:31.289
Ab, I got one!

10:31.375 --> 10:33.008
Right back here! Are
you (Bleep) kidding me?

10:33.093 --> 10:34.760
Oh, my God! What the...

10:35.879 --> 10:38.213
(bleep)!

10:38.298 --> 10:39.214
What do you think about this

10:39.299 --> 10:40.682
for my Facebook status update?

10:40.768 --> 10:43.852
"Seeking air conditioner, free to cheap.

10:43.937 --> 10:44.936
Thanks. Bye, guys."

10:44.972 --> 10:46.021
"Bye, guys" is my favorite part.

10:46.106 --> 10:47.472
I love that. I want more you.

10:47.558 --> 10:48.807
I want more panache.

10:48.859 --> 10:51.309
I want more spunk, more jizzy-jazz.

10:51.361 --> 10:52.227
Eww, okay.

10:54.364 --> 10:56.865
Maybe Lincoln would want
an avocado for his birthday?

10:56.950 --> 10:58.650
Or like a bag of avocados?

10:58.735 --> 10:59.785
No.

10:59.820 --> 11:04.406
Sent into... cloud.

11:04.491 --> 11:06.241
Whoa, dude, I got two responses already.

11:06.326 --> 11:08.710
Oh, my God. That's so embarrassing.

11:08.796 --> 11:12.497
They are like up Facebook's
butthole, no shame!

11:12.583 --> 11:14.332
Okay, one is from my old babysitter.

11:14.384 --> 11:15.417
Whoa.

11:15.502 --> 11:16.501
Who, if I'm being honest,

11:16.553 --> 11:18.170
potentially broke up my parents.

11:18.255 --> 11:20.172
- Whoa!
- So, no.

11:20.224 --> 11:22.224
The second one's Benny Calitri.

11:22.309 --> 11:23.592
Who's Benny Calitri?

11:23.677 --> 11:25.177
I have one mutual friend.

11:25.229 --> 11:27.729
(Humming)

11:27.815 --> 11:30.098
(Phone vibrating)

11:30.184 --> 11:31.516
Hello?

11:31.568 --> 11:33.185
Hey, Bevers. Who's Benny Calitri?

11:33.237 --> 11:34.853
<i>- Do I know him?
- Yes!</i>

11:34.905 --> 11:36.354
Remember you had that party,

11:36.406 --> 11:38.023
you told me I couldn't bring a "plus one"?

11:38.108 --> 11:39.691
He was my "plus one"!

11:39.743 --> 11:40.859
<i>- Great, thanks.
- He's one of my best friends.</i>

11:40.944 --> 11:42.160
Did you guys...

11:44.198 --> 11:46.581
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.500
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

11:48.535 --> 11:51.203
Mm... uh-oh! (Laughing)

11:51.255 --> 11:54.673
(Humming)

11:54.708 --> 11:56.541
You know, I've never been
to this neighborhood before,

11:56.627 --> 12:00.212
but I'm not scared, 'cause
I'm with a stone cold rapist!

12:00.264 --> 12:02.631
Okay. All right.

12:02.716 --> 12:03.598
- Listen, Ab...
- That I am.

12:03.684 --> 12:05.217
It's reverse rapism.

12:05.269 --> 12:06.635
You are raping rape culture.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.769
Yes!

12:07.855 --> 12:09.221
- Hey, I'm Benny.
- Yeah.

12:09.306 --> 12:10.522
We've actually met before.

12:10.557 --> 12:11.556
Yeah, I'm sorry, I wasn't
talking to you guys.

12:11.608 --> 12:13.058
I'm doing my testimonial

12:13.110 --> 12:14.643
for my "Amazing Race" submission.

12:15.863 --> 12:17.279
I'm just a guy looking for a challenge

12:17.364 --> 12:18.897
that'll change his life forever.

12:20.033 --> 12:21.399
- Yes?
- So, yeah.

12:21.451 --> 12:22.901
Thank you so much for this A/C.

12:22.986 --> 12:24.703
If there's anything I
can do to repay you...

12:24.738 --> 12:26.621
Actually, if you guys want to carry boxes

12:26.707 --> 12:27.956
to the truck, that'd be great.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.040
- I guess.
- Okay.

12:30.377 --> 12:31.710
A couple of my best friends showed up.

12:31.745 --> 12:34.079
Even though they were pretty stacked,

12:34.131 --> 12:35.714
I've got to keep my eye on the prize...

12:35.749 --> 12:37.716
"The Amazing Race"!

12:37.751 --> 12:41.670
♪ ♪

12:54.985 --> 12:56.101
Thanks so much, guys.

12:56.153 --> 12:58.403
You really pulled my butt out of the fire.

12:58.438 --> 12:59.854
Yeah, thanks for...

12:59.940 --> 13:00.772
One question... why do you guys

13:00.824 --> 13:01.823
want a broken air conditioner?

13:01.909 --> 13:02.941
What?

13:02.993 --> 13:04.326
Your post said, and I quote,

13:04.411 --> 13:07.028
"broke-ass girl looking
for an A/C to match."

13:07.114 --> 13:08.246
Why would I ever want a
broken air conditioner?

13:08.282 --> 13:09.948
(Bleep)! (Bleep) me!

13:10.000 --> 13:11.533
I'm not big into slang,

13:11.618 --> 13:13.618
but I assumed "broke-ass" means "broken"?

13:13.704 --> 13:15.453
Okay, I know you guys
are annoyed right now...

13:15.505 --> 13:16.621
I'm great at reading vibes...

13:16.707 --> 13:19.124
but are either of you
good at bungee jumping,

13:19.209 --> 13:20.709
or can drive a stick shift?

13:20.794 --> 13:21.960
I need someone for "Amazing Race"

13:22.012 --> 13:23.295
because my mom just pulled out.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.547
Maybe your dad should have pulled out.

13:25.632 --> 13:26.848
Whoa, dude.

13:26.934 --> 13:28.350
- That was awesome.
- I just thought of that.

13:28.435 --> 13:29.351
I don't get it.

13:29.436 --> 13:30.518
Why don't you take Bevers?

13:30.604 --> 13:31.853
Oh, he can't.

13:31.939 --> 13:32.804
He's got all those kittens to take care of.

13:32.856 --> 13:33.972
What kittens?

13:34.024 --> 13:36.641
- Oh, drama.
- What?

13:36.727 --> 13:38.393
Drama seems to follow me wherever I go,

13:38.478 --> 13:39.477
especially when I'm with the ladies...

13:39.529 --> 13:41.863
Stop talking now, please!

13:41.949 --> 13:44.816
Stop doing your lame-o video!

13:44.901 --> 13:47.235
You're not gonna make it!

13:47.321 --> 13:48.920
Can we try that again
without you guys yelling?

13:50.476 --> 13:51.725
This is gonna work.

13:51.811 --> 13:53.360
I left my air conditioner here last year

13:53.446 --> 13:55.896
when I graduated. It's
technically still mine.

13:55.982 --> 13:56.981
It's like when a mom

13:57.066 --> 13:58.449
gives up a baby for adoption,

13:58.484 --> 13:59.650
she should be able to go

13:59.702 --> 14:01.786
and get that baby back
whenever she pleases.

14:01.821 --> 14:04.321
I can't... I can't get into
adoption with you again.

14:04.373 --> 14:06.740
It's... smart. Smart.

14:08.377 --> 14:09.326
(Ilana) Hello, sir!

14:09.378 --> 14:10.661
I'm gonna sign my friend in here.

14:12.415 --> 14:13.464
This is expired.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.635
Oh, I see. We are loving lesbians,

14:17.670 --> 14:19.336
so this is because we're clearly lesbians?

14:19.388 --> 14:20.554
Okay.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.890
'Cause your hetero-normative notion...

14:22.975 --> 14:24.141
I don't care if you're lesbians.

14:25.428 --> 14:26.510
Okay.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.729
I guess it's because we're straight, then?

14:28.815 --> 14:30.648
Because we're a minority in our class,

14:30.683 --> 14:32.066
we shouldn't be treated equally?

14:32.151 --> 14:35.986
The straight girls of
2015 shafted yet again!

14:36.022 --> 14:39.023
You kids are all straight,
and you're all gay.

14:39.075 --> 14:40.357
Thank you.

14:40.443 --> 14:42.243
Thank you, sir.

14:42.328 --> 14:43.577
(Abbi) Okay, we'll just do the thing,

14:43.663 --> 14:45.196
get in, get out. We got this.

14:45.248 --> 14:46.697
Yes, we got this. (Grunting)

14:50.369 --> 14:52.002
Guys, some lady and her mom are here.

14:52.038 --> 14:53.204
(Ilana) Good one.

14:53.289 --> 14:54.672
- What are you, a comedian?
- Pretty much.

14:54.707 --> 14:56.457
My uncle is Adam Corolla.

14:57.593 --> 14:58.592
(Whispering) That's it.

14:59.879 --> 15:01.679
(Abbi) Okay, we're your new R.A.s,

15:01.714 --> 15:04.098
so I'd cut it with the douche-fest, asap.

15:04.183 --> 15:05.966
This is a spontaneous room raid.

15:06.052 --> 15:07.935
Whoo!

15:08.020 --> 15:09.053
Guys, we don't want any trouble.

15:09.105 --> 15:10.688
I'm hoping, boys,

15:10.723 --> 15:12.806
that we don't find any contraband in here,

15:12.892 --> 15:14.808
'cause that would not be good for you.

15:14.894 --> 15:16.560
Uh-oh. Mini-fridge.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.898
(Gasping) Hey, now!

15:20.950 --> 15:23.317
What do we got here?

15:23.402 --> 15:24.902
Mad vodka, huh?

15:24.954 --> 15:26.403
Good stuff, huh?

15:26.489 --> 15:27.571
And it's also against the rules.

15:27.657 --> 15:29.490
Strike uno!

15:29.575 --> 15:31.458
(Abbi) Lordy, lordy!

15:31.544 --> 15:32.826
(Laughing)

15:32.912 --> 15:34.495
Janet's 40!

15:34.580 --> 15:38.215
This is... stah-rike two!

15:38.251 --> 15:39.800
(Sniffing)

15:39.886 --> 15:41.418
(Abbi) What is it, girl? What is it?

15:41.470 --> 15:44.171
- Smell something?
- (Sniffing)

15:44.257 --> 15:45.306
(Gasping)

15:45.391 --> 15:47.007
Lordy, lordy.

15:47.093 --> 15:51.512
Janet just turned 40!

15:51.597 --> 15:52.680
What the crap is that?

15:52.765 --> 15:53.814
This is strike three.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.099
Honestly, that's not ours.

15:55.151 --> 15:57.351
Yeah, who would leave
weed in a wall, anyway?

15:57.436 --> 15:59.570
(Mocking) Who would leave weed in a wall?

15:59.605 --> 16:01.155
A weed genius!

16:01.240 --> 16:02.773
And she'd leave it there indefinitely,

16:02.858 --> 16:05.442
in case of emergency.

16:05.528 --> 16:08.946
This is a serious
violation of the ethics code

16:08.998 --> 16:12.249
our dear university abides by.

16:12.285 --> 16:16.120
I'm sorry, but as R.A.s,
we've got to report you.

16:17.373 --> 16:19.790
Hold on, Ilana. Hold on, hold on.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.458
I don't think the head R.A. needs

16:21.544 --> 16:22.793
to find out about this.

16:22.845 --> 16:24.178
It's their first violation.

16:24.263 --> 16:26.964
Maybe we just revoke the
A/C privileges, you know?

16:27.049 --> 16:28.515
Call it a day.

16:28.601 --> 16:30.134
I guess that's fair. Deal.

16:30.186 --> 16:31.969
Guys, seriously, the weed isn't ours.

16:32.021 --> 16:33.137
- It's not ours.
- Also...

16:33.189 --> 16:34.555
What does this have to do with the A/C?

16:34.640 --> 16:36.307
(Abbi) These are the
rules, and when you graduate

16:36.359 --> 16:37.608
and get a real job like an R.A.,

16:37.643 --> 16:38.809
we can talk about it.

16:38.861 --> 16:41.145
- R.A.s are students.
- When you graduate,

16:41.230 --> 16:43.731
we can talk about what
an R.A. is and isn't,

16:43.816 --> 16:46.150
and whether or not we are students.

16:46.202 --> 16:50.788
While my partner in justice

16:50.823 --> 16:52.990
removes your A/C,

16:53.075 --> 16:56.660
I'm gonna teach you boys about the dangers

16:56.712 --> 16:58.412
of ripping underaged bongs.

16:58.497 --> 17:00.047
Now, you take this, brother.

17:00.132 --> 17:02.333
You're gonna smoke the whole bag.

17:02.418 --> 17:03.884
You're first, little buddy.

17:03.970 --> 17:06.220
- Now, suck it up.
- (Bong bubbling)

17:06.305 --> 17:08.005
That's it. And here we go.

17:08.089 --> 17:11.925
♪ ♪

17:42.875 --> 17:44.842
(Ilana) Yeah, I invented this app...

17:44.877 --> 17:48.295
Well, okay, I didn't
invent it yet, but soon.

17:48.381 --> 17:51.932
It's this photo app that,
um, adds lasers to images,

17:52.018 --> 17:54.601
so you could put lasers coming out of eyes,

17:54.687 --> 17:56.553
or nipples, or buttholes.

17:56.605 --> 17:57.721
That'd be pretty cool,

17:57.773 --> 17:59.023
if it wasn't already an app.

17:59.058 --> 18:00.391
Ugh.

18:00.443 --> 18:02.109
Wow, you hands are big.

18:02.194 --> 18:03.394
I don't know what that mean...

18:03.479 --> 18:06.063
I could say something,
like "big hands," or...

18:06.115 --> 18:07.064
Right? (Chuckling)

18:07.116 --> 18:08.365
(Laughing)

18:08.401 --> 18:09.366
Stop it.

18:09.402 --> 18:11.151
You're so funny.

18:11.237 --> 18:12.619
Have you ever heard of Bleepy?

18:12.705 --> 18:14.538
Of course! Bleepy is huge!

18:14.573 --> 18:16.323
Well, I invented that.

18:16.409 --> 18:17.741
- No!
- It's obviously

18:17.827 --> 18:20.461
not my only capitalist
venture at this time.

18:20.546 --> 18:22.579
Eww.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.248
Whoa, look at that.

18:27.136 --> 18:28.252
Dude.

18:28.304 --> 18:30.838
I'm definitely applying here next year.

18:30.923 --> 18:33.307
Wait, I thought you said you're a senior.

18:33.392 --> 18:35.926
I am, at Morristown Prep Academy.

18:37.396 --> 18:39.063
Okay.

18:39.098 --> 18:43.901
So, how... old are you?

18:43.936 --> 18:45.903
16.

18:45.938 --> 18:47.606
Oh, I've done it again.

18:49.478 --> 18:50.561
I'm a repeated sex offender.

18:50.596 --> 18:51.729
I'm a monster,

18:51.764 --> 18:53.097
and I just have to deal with that, so...

18:53.182 --> 18:54.315
Okay, okay.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.401
So, you made out with a minor.

18:57.436 --> 19:00.854
You finished a couple of moments

19:00.940 --> 19:02.606
after a dude went unconscious.

19:02.658 --> 19:04.608
You're a sex offender at worst!

19:04.694 --> 19:06.660
- Welcome to the club.
- (Scoffing)

19:06.746 --> 19:07.745
- Honestly.
- There's a club?

19:07.780 --> 19:08.779
I didn't know there was a club.

19:08.864 --> 19:10.114
Yeah, it's, uh... (Laughing)

19:10.166 --> 19:11.332
It's not hard to get into.

19:11.417 --> 19:11.582
(Both laughing)

19:14.199 --> 19:17.083
And very, very Happy Birthday.

19:17.169 --> 19:18.752
Thank you.

19:18.837 --> 19:20.620
- "Reginald corolla"?
- Yeah.

19:20.705 --> 19:24.924
This asshole's got $3,600 on his meal card.

19:25.010 --> 19:26.876
That's awesome, 'cause my office

19:26.928 --> 19:29.095
is right around the corner
from an NYU dining hall.

19:29.181 --> 19:30.880
- That's amazing.
- I love it.

19:30.966 --> 19:34.134
I am honored and thrilled

19:34.219 --> 19:35.969
that you would steal something for me.

19:36.054 --> 19:38.054
- I feel like a fugitive.
- Yeah?

19:38.106 --> 19:41.141
And if anyone asks, I'll say...

19:41.226 --> 19:42.642
the one-armed man took it.

19:42.727 --> 19:43.943
(Both laughing)

19:45.397 --> 19:47.230
Yes.

19:47.315 --> 19:48.782
You don't get it, do you?

19:48.867 --> 19:50.400
No, I don't get it at all.

19:50.485 --> 19:52.452
(Both laughing)

19:55.207 --> 19:57.657
Ooh, you guys are gonna
have to thank Aunt Abbi

19:57.742 --> 19:59.242
for your comfy new bed.

19:59.327 --> 20:00.910
That's her sweatshirt.

20:00.996 --> 20:03.046
We're a happy family, right?

20:03.081 --> 20:05.415
You got me, daddy-maddy.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.250
You got Odysseus,

20:07.302 --> 20:11.137
Medusa, Artemis, Hermes.

20:11.223 --> 20:13.173
You got Drew...

20:13.258 --> 20:14.257
Drew?

20:14.342 --> 20:17.260
Guys, where is Drew?

20:17.312 --> 20:18.695
Drew!

20:18.763 --> 20:20.814
It is so nice in here!

20:20.899 --> 20:21.981
- So good.
- It's so good!

20:22.067 --> 20:23.233
- I feel amazing.
- It's amazing.

20:23.268 --> 20:24.234
It's like a whole other apartment.

20:24.269 --> 20:25.268
It is, right?

20:25.353 --> 20:26.269
Like a whole 'nother apartment, yeah.

20:26.321 --> 20:27.437
Yes. Yes!

20:27.522 --> 20:28.571
- (Coughing)
- So good.

20:28.607 --> 20:29.572
So good.

20:29.608 --> 20:31.024
So good!

20:32.110 --> 20:33.693
(Kitten meowing)

20:33.778 --> 20:34.661
(Kitten meowing)

20:35.864 --> 20:37.497
(Together) Holy (Bleep)!

20:38.950 --> 20:40.116
(Bleep)!

20:40.168 --> 20:41.868
Who the (Bleep) are you?

20:41.953 --> 20:43.169
(Stacey) How did you get in here?

20:43.255 --> 20:45.922
How did you get into my apartment?

20:45.957 --> 20:47.507
(Abbi) You're sitting here watching us?

20:47.592 --> 20:48.791
You (Bleep) perv!

20:48.792 --> 20:51.530
Get in that box!

20:51.531 --> 20:53.575
No, you got some explaining to do!

20:53.576 --> 20:54.945
Are you sure that's even a cat?
