LORD HATER: Whoo!

00:36.912 --> 00:40.123
That's one more. Peepers,
put it on the board.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.294
PEEPERS: You're number three, sir.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.463
I'm so proud of you.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.257
Hear that, Biggieborp?

00:48.340 --> 00:49.758
Number three!

00:50.175 --> 00:52.594
I conquered your planet.
I conquered your planet.

LORD HATER: Whoo!

01:07.025 --> 01:12.489
Sir, I really love the enthusiasm
but it's really late, and I'm really tired

01:12.573 --> 01:14.908
Can't we just destroy them in the morning?

01:15.951 --> 01:21.290
Aw! But I wanna destroy 'em now!
Right, guys?

01:21.707 --> 01:24.835
-sir!
-okay...

01:24.918 --> 01:26.044
Sorry, guys.

So just enjoy yourselves

01:30.090 --> 01:33.802

needed a place to crash for the night.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.925
So we popped in.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.098
Don't worry.
We bust out of here all the time.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.100

So, buddy, appreciate you keeping
spirits up, but shouldn't we

03:50.898 --> 03:52.024
Oh, I don't know.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.484
Get out of here before we blasted

Huh? Where's the party?

04:28.352 --> 04:32.606
MOLE KING: No party here. Just bemoaning
our impending doom.

awesome party, and it's gonna be awesome!

Oh, it's just those stupid
rulers and their stupid party.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.695
There's another party?

05:19.778 --> 05:23.824
Yeah, a super lame one in the prison with
karaoke, games, and scrumptious

05:23.907 --> 05:25.325
But it's in no way...

05:27.536 --> 05:28.871
as awesome as this one.

Lord Hater, number one superstar.

MOOSE: Not on the list.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.645
How does one get on the list?

05:53.729 --> 05:58.192
Watchdogs and deposed royalty only.

06:02.112 --> 06:08.869
Ahem! It is I, deposed king,
uh... Schmater.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.245
Nailed it.

06:20.255 --> 06:24.843
All right. Time to show these chumps how
to party Hater-style. I mean

06:25.052 --> 06:27.054
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Schmater-style!

06:30.933 --> 06:32.559
Cool party, huh?

06:32.768 --> 06:37.606
Just a bunch of totally legit kings
celebrating being destroyed

06:37.689 --> 06:40.067
by the terrible and handsome Hater.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.401
What? What?

06:45.155 --> 06:48.659
I like your bracelets.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.077
DEMURRA: They're shackles.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.122
Uh cheerio, aye

07:03.173 --> 07:05.801
Come on. What happened to being bold,
and living

07:05.884 --> 07:08.178
tonight like it's the last night of
our lives?

07:08.262 --> 07:13.308
Taking risks, doing crazy things,
and what's crazier and riskier

07:13.392 --> 07:16.019
than partying with the guy
who's going to destroy us.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.754
PEEPERS: Sir, where are the deposed rulers
scheduled for destruction?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.966
I don't know exactly where they went.

10:33.050 --> 10:37.930
To tell the truth, it was a pretty wild
party. I'm not exactly sure what happened.

10:38.597 --> 10:39.932
PEEPERS: Was Wander there?

10:41.225 --> 10:43.393
Yeah, maybe.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.085
Oh, yeah.

Nothing can stop me now.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.443
(ALARM BLARING)

11:34.611 --> 11:39.157
MAJOR THREAT: Lord Hater,
your reign of terror is over!

11:41.493 --> 11:43.203
Oh my Grop. It's him.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.293
LORD HATER: It's... Major Threat

11:52.045 --> 11:54.715
PEEPERS: His telekinetic powers
can crush planets.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.803
That dude is the evilest
evil-doer that ever do-ed evil.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.139
PEEPERS: Sir, we're doomed! After all

12:02.222 --> 12:04.725
these years of conquering,
it comes down to this.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.312
When I finally meet my... Idol

12:08.395 --> 12:10.397
Huge, huge fan!

12:10.480 --> 12:13.609
I know, like all your evil deeds.
You're pretty much the reason

12:13.692 --> 12:15.611
I got into villainy in the first place

12:15.694 --> 12:17.362
Threat's best! Great villain!

12:24.912 --> 12:26.413
MAJOR THREAT: Call me Jeff.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.667
Ok, Jeff.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.169
You are like, the worst

12:32.252 --> 12:34.546
the best! Best at being the worst

12:34.671 --> 12:36.715
Uh, thanks, bud.

12:36.798 --> 12:37.841
Bud!

12:37.966 --> 12:41.553
But I'm really embarrassed
about all that conquering stuff

12:41.637 --> 12:45.516
It was just take, take, take,
without giving a thought to,

12:45.891 --> 12:50.270
you know, the people, man, and
how they were feeling.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.776
Sorry, man, this must be a bit of a shock.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.236
I'm sure you were expecting

12:57.361 --> 13:01.114
Roar! I shall destroy your soul.

13:01.198 --> 13:06.161
And here I am, all peace and love, man.
You must be all, What?

13:06.245 --> 13:10.040
Did Major Threat go all cuckoo in
the head, right?

13:10.123 --> 13:13.043
Uh, yeah. Kinda thought cuckoo head, yeah

13:13.293 --> 13:15.420
Well, I did. I went cuckoo.

13:15.504 --> 13:20.300
MAJOR THREAT: Cuckoo for conquering, until
I crossed paths with this wandering weirdo

13:20.717 --> 13:24.137
Strange visitor from from who knows where,
who came to my galaxy

13:24.221 --> 13:28.141
with powers of positivity
far beyond those of anyone.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.852
Oh, no.

13:30.060 --> 13:34.731
Yeah, he went around helping everyone
totally drove me even cuckoo-ier.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.275
-Oh no

13:36.441 --> 13:39.945
I chased him around the
galaxy, vowing to destroy him.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.114
Yes! I mean, Oh, no.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.701
Yeah and in the end, do you
know what he wanted

13:45.784 --> 13:49.204
No, what? What did Wand-
I mean, what did he want?

13:49.288 --> 13:52.749
MAJOR THREAT: Just to be my friend.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.087
That's crazy, man.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.132
It was like he wanted me
to hate him at first.

14:00.299 --> 14:01.884
When he eventually wore me down

14:01.967 --> 14:05.679
MAJOR THREAT: and we became friends,
I realized that if I learned to like

14:05.762 --> 14:08.932
this one thing I used to hate,
then what was the point of hating

14:09.141 --> 14:12.311
all the other stuff I hated,
with less hate in my heart?

14:12.477 --> 14:17.024
-I might start to be happy and not be
-Such a bad guy anymore.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.525
MAJOR THREAT: Exactly, man.

14:18.609 --> 14:22.362
So, like I was saying earlier, your
reign of terror is going to have to end.

14:22.446 --> 14:26.033
MAJOR THREAT: Man, this aggression
won't stand.

14:28.410 --> 14:33.248
(SCREAMS) No! I warned you, Peepers!

14:33.332 --> 14:37.628
Sir, just because Major Threat fell prey
to that wandering weirdo, it doesn't...

14:37.711 --> 14:41.048
It's hopeless!

14:42.549 --> 14:43.634
Don't you see?

14:44.343 --> 14:48.388
Threat was the villainiest villain
of all time, and Wander

14:48.472 --> 14:55.395
loved the hate right out
of him. He Wander-ized him.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.190
And now he wants to Wander-ize me.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.692
Here man, let me help you fix this.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.278
That's it! I can fix you!

15:03.362 --> 15:05.989
Sir, I don't think that's such
a good idea.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.284
No, if I can remind him how good
he is at being evil

15:09.368 --> 15:12.746
it'll prove once and for all
that bad is in the bones.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.165
You are not good

15:15.249 --> 15:20.712
You are just bad at remembering
how good it was being bad.

15:20.796 --> 15:24.925
Like the time you conquered
the unconquerable Klangors.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.969
Yeah, the Klangors, man.

15:27.052 --> 15:32.057
I gave up being their evil dictator, and
turned them on to democratic elections.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.602
Okay, okay, bad example.
You blew up the sun of Solarion!

15:35.686 --> 15:39.189
MAJOR THREAT: Now it's Skilorian,
a winter getaway

15:39.273 --> 15:43.235
and non-profit research facility to
study climate change.

15:45.863 --> 15:50.325
Your band! Ninety-Ounce Nihilists?

15:50.409 --> 15:53.036
You were the loudest,
most evil band in the universe!

15:53.120 --> 15:54.746
MAJOR THREAT: Oh, no, no, no, no

15:54.830 --> 15:56.748
I could never quit music, man

15:56.832 --> 15:59.459
Me and the guys still hang out and jam.

16:01.420 --> 16:07.426
You see? You can be even greater by saying
"later" to the Hate-er.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.637
Stop hugging everything!

16:11.054 --> 16:13.390
Okay, time for the big guns.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.101
Victimon!

16:16.185 --> 16:18.312
They are primed and ready for destruction.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.356
LORD HATER: I would like you to
do the honors.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.317
You're sure?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.401
Oh, please.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.321
If this doesn't get
the evil juices flowing, nothing will

16:27.404 --> 16:28.780
I insist.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.491
Well, if you insist

16:34.536 --> 16:39.708
(ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) Yes, Yes!

16:47.007 --> 16:48.842
LORD HATER: Nooo!

16:48.926 --> 16:50.969
Whoa, take her easy, man.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.222
MAJOR THREAT: Just take her easy.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.683
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna
do about it, Jeff?

16:56.767 --> 17:01.813
Huh, man? You gonna play your stupid flute
for some poor puppy orphans?

17:12.533 --> 17:14.952
I'll have your hug waitin' when
you're ready

17:18.956 --> 17:21.917
Fine! You can't keep us prisoner!
We're leaving!

17:22.167 --> 17:23.252
Come on, Peepers.

17:23.335 --> 17:27.214
Sir, he never actually took us prisoner.
Also, technically, this is our ship.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.340
Shut up.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.550
I know that.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.095
Hey, hug it out. Don't slug it out.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.475
LORD HATER: Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.186
Does that bother you, Jeff?

17:46.942 --> 17:49.611
PEEPERS: Seriously, sir, you really...
Ow! My retina!

17:54.449 --> 17:57.578
Hey, how do you like it
if I treated you like that? You know?

18:01.206 --> 18:03.667
What if I slapped your helmet off,
man, huh?

18:04.251 --> 18:09.089
What if I pushed you to the ground?
Yeah, and take over your ship?

18:13.218 --> 18:16.805
Yeah, and what if I take over your
whole army, huh?

18:16.972 --> 18:20.392
MAJOR THREAT: Then what would,
would, w-w... by Grop!

18:20.475 --> 18:22.603
I forgot how good being bad feels.

18:22.895 --> 18:23.937
Yeah.

18:24.021 --> 18:27.941
Major Threat is back, and I'm gonna
conquer every planet

18:28.108 --> 18:32.696
in this whole stinkin Galaxy,
starting with yours.

18:33.906 --> 18:34.990
What?

18:40.204 --> 18:41.246
I can't beat him.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.748
It's over. I'm finished,

18:42.831 --> 18:44.708
done, conquered. That dude

18:44.791 --> 18:48.837
I mean, Major Threat is the evilest
evil-doer that ever do-ed evil!

18:49.254 --> 18:51.840
The only reason he was stopped last time
was because

18:51.924 --> 18:55.469
Oh, no. Not that.

18:55.594 --> 19:00.974
Oh, yeah, that's five! Five more
planets that are mine!

19:01.141 --> 19:05.437
All mine! Peepsqueak, how great am I?

19:05.604 --> 19:09.441
Tenth planet in the last five minutes,
sir, which means-

19:09.775 --> 19:13.737
I'm ten steps closer to once again

19:13.820 --> 19:17.783
becoming the greatest in the galaxy!

19:17.866 --> 19:19.993
Nothing can stop me now!

19:20.077 --> 19:21.078
Stopping all ready?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.871
LORD HATER: Threaty, is that you?

19:23.205 --> 19:27.251
It's me. Your old pal, Sunshine Banjo Face

19:28.335 --> 19:30.963
Why the frowny face, Sir Frownsalot?

19:31.213 --> 19:36.093
Let's go tickle some caterpillars, and
make lemonade out of snowflakes!

19:38.846 --> 19:45.185
Major Threat will not abide by such a
disgusting display of optimism!

19:49.773 --> 19:53.277
Take that and that,
you grop-derned flabdrassers

19:56.822 --> 20:00.409
There's only one thing to trump the
grumpies, and that's...

20:02.744 --> 20:06.707
LORD HATER (PLAYING BANJO)

20:06.874 --> 20:12.880
LORD HATER (SINGING): When you wander
over that way...

20:13.005 --> 20:14.590
and wear a stupid hat.

20:15.924 --> 20:22.723
Then you help some stupid people...
And wear a stupid hat!

20:25.017 --> 20:28.061
When the bad guys come a-creepin' and
lookin' really cool,

20:28.145 --> 20:31.190
just do some friendly dumb things
and act just like a fool

20:38.405 --> 20:42.618
MAJOR THREAT (GROANS)

20:44.828 --> 20:50.250
Sorry I had to fool you there, but I knew
there was good deep down in those bones.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.752
Oh, no.

20:52.127 --> 20:56.715
You not only helped your friends here,
but you also saved yourself, man.

20:56.798 --> 20:57.799
Oh, no.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.009
You'll thank me later.

20:59.092 --> 21:03.472
It's like Tumbleweed always said,
"Never hurts to help."

21:04.014 --> 21:05.474
-Who?
-Tumbleweed?

21:05.557 --> 21:10.187
That goofball that drove me crazy,
then made me a better person.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.482
-Wait, wasn't his name Wander?
-Uhm, nope

21:13.565 --> 21:14.942
Folks called him Tumbleweed

21:15.025 --> 21:19.238
Yess! Whoo! Thank Grop.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.867
Oh, I was worried for a second that I was
doomed to suffer the same fate as you

21:23.951 --> 21:26.537
but I'm obviously so much better
and more evil.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.581
LORD HATER: Well, don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.834
I don't know what I was freaked out about.

21:31.959 --> 21:34.503
My annoying wanderer is totally different.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.714
He plays a dumb banjo and
hands out stupid sandwiches

21:37.798 --> 21:41.927
Ha! Mustard or mayo?
Mustard or mayo? Mustard or mayo?

21:50.561 --> 21:53.522
We could play a hand full of jelly beans
and grow a rainbow.

21:53.605 --> 21:56.733
Or shake hands with the lady bug
at the carnival in the clouds.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.278
Or shave a candy cane
down the peppermint cleaner

21:59.361 --> 22:00.612
or give butterfly kisses.

22:00.696 --> 22:01.864
Do an actual butterfly.

22:01.947 --> 22:02.948
Or...
