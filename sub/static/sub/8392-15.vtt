- YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE IT.
- OKAY.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.006
- HEY, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS DAWES THING.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.620
- WHAT DAWES THING?

08:55.670 --> 08:57.592
- WELL, I WAS ONLINE AND
I READ A BUNCH OF INTERVIEWS,

08:57.640 --> 08:59.949
AND THESE GUYS WERE INSPIRED
BY A LOT OF THE FOLK--

08:59.980 --> 09:01.561
- APPARENTLY MY BROTHER
WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

09:01.610 --> 09:03.180
- HEY, LILY, SORRY.
- JUST BEAR WITH US.

09:03.230 --> 09:05.607
- BOB DYLAN, CROSBY, STILLS,
NASH AND YOUNG, AND I THINK

09:05.640 --> 09:07.642
THEY WOULD LOVE VIBE
HERE AT THE LUNCHEONETTE.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.954
- UH, OF COURSE THEY WOULD.
-WELL LET'S GET THEM IN HERE.

09:08.990 --> 09:10.787
- EVERYONE WOULD LOVE THE VIBE
HERE, WE HAVE A GREAT STUDIO.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.957
- WELL, LET'S GET THEM IN HERE,
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

09:11.990 --> 09:13.264
- I DON'T KNOW THEM,
KNOW THEM.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.447
I'VE ONLY MET THEM
A COUPLE TIMES.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.334
- WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH
OF A RELATIONSHIP TO REACH OUT.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.961
- OKAY.
- CROSBY, THE INITIAL BUZZ

09:18.000 --> 09:18.819
IN THIS PLACE IS GOING
TO WEAR OFF

09:18.860 --> 09:20.100
AND THEN WHERE
ARE WE GOING TO BE?

09:20.140 --> 09:21.937
WE GOT TO BE PROACT IVE, WE GOT
TO GET NEW CLIENTS IN HERE.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.619
- WELL, I'M WITH
A CLIENT, RIGHT NOW.

09:23.660 --> 09:24.558
- I CAN SEE THAT.

09:24.590 --> 09:26.171
WELL, IS SHE EVEN
PAYING FOR THE TIME?

09:26.220 --> 09:28.313
- YES, IN A SENSE,
SHE IS PAYING FOR THE TIME.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.804
- YEAH, WELL, IN A SENSE DOESN'T
PAY THE BILLS, ALL RIGHT?

09:29.840 --> 09:31.216
I WANT YOU TO REACH OUT,
OKAY?

09:31.260 --> 09:33.592
- OKAY, MM-HMM.
- ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.971
- THANKS, COACH.

09:35.020 --> 09:36.601
- ARE YOU READY?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.119
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL EVER BE READY.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.152
- LET'S DO IT.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.716
[psychedelic violin remix]

09:45.750 --> 09:47.684
- STOP. SHUT IT DOWN.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.779
IT'S MUSIC
FROM THE FUTURE.

09:49.830 --> 09:53.755
- YOU DID SUCH A GREAT
JOB AT THE FUNDRAISER, I, UH--

09:53.800 --> 09:55.939
I FIGURED YOU WOULD BE
THE PERFECT PERSON

09:55.970 --> 09:59.929
FOR THIS, UH,
KIND OF INSANE PROJECT.

09:59.970 --> 10:01.699
- OKAY.

10:01.730 --> 10:04.699
- YEAH, BASICALLY I TAKE
NOTES ON CONVERSATIONS

10:04.740 --> 10:08.358
I'VE HAD WITH PEOPLE.
- OH.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.392
- YEAH, WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT,
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM,

10:11.430 --> 10:14.911
YOU KNOW, ANYTHING
THAT'S KIND OF RELEVANT.

10:14.950 --> 10:18.329
THIS IS KIND OF CREEPY TO YOU,
BUT I MEET SO MANY PEOPLE

10:18.370 --> 10:19.712
THAT IT'S KIND OF BECOME
A NECESSITY.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.435
AND NOW I'M, LIKE,
COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.368
- YEAH.
- I COULD USE SOME FOCUS.

10:24.410 --> 10:26.275
OR SOMEBODY TO TRANSCRIBE IT
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

10:26.310 --> 10:29.723
- YEAH, SURE, UM,
I COULD DO THAT.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.137
I COULD ALSO, LIKE, LOAD THEM
ONTO YOUR PHONE OR SOMETHING--

10:32.180 --> 10:33.204
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.866
IF YOU CAN READ MY
CHICKEN SCRATCH HANDWRITING,

10:35.910 --> 10:38.697
GO TO THE RACES.

"HEAD OF THE ZONE FIVE
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL,

"THINKS THE GIANTS ARE
UNDERRATED THIS SEASON,

10:43.780 --> 10:45.736
ESPECIALLY PABLO SANDOVAL."
AIN'T IT THE TRUTH.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.248
- NOW, WHILE YOU MIGHT
THINK THIS IS IRRELEVANT,

10:48.300 --> 10:51.269
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, THEY LIKE
TO BE REMEMBERED.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.098
- NEXT TIME I SEE
JAMES STODDARD,

10:54.130 --> 10:57.429
I WILL LET HIM KNOW THAT
HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT SANDOVAL.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.687
- AKA PANDA.
- PANDA.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.779
- I'LL PUT THAT IN.
- YES, THANK YOU.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.684
- IS THIS, LIKE,
POLITICIAN SKEEW OR--

11:03.730 --> 11:06.369
- NO, I MEAN, IT IS,
BUT JUST ENOUGH.

11:06.420 --> 11:10.242
ACTUALLY I WAS JUST WORRYING
ABOUT WHAT STUPID THING

11:10.290 --> 11:12.736
I SAID THAT'S GOING TO MAKE
IT ON MY POST-IT.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.738
- NO, NO, AMBER YOU'RE NOT
IN HERE BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE

11:14.770 --> 11:17.421
THAT I'D OTHERWISE FORGET.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.111
YOU'RE NOT

BOB LI'ITLE'S OFFICE,
THIS IS AMBER SPEAKING.

11:33.410 --> 11:34.889
- THAT'S NICE.

11:34.930 --> 11:39.515
- UH, LET ME CHECK IF HE'S
AVAILABLE, PLEASE HOLD.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.788
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS,

11:40.830 --> 11:44.721
BUT IT'S YOUR MOM.

11:44.770 --> 11:49.218
- WELL, THIS IS TOTALLY
EMBARRASSING.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.420
- I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU SOME PRIVACY.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.087
- NO, PLEASE DO NOT,
SHE'S JUST CALLING,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.532
I'M SURE, TO NAG ME
FOR SOMETHING.

11:54.570 --> 11:56.367
IF I MAKE A...[mock choke]

11:56.400 --> 11:58.368
- YOU WILL HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT MEETING, YES.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.879
- YOU GOT IT.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.400
MOM, HOW YOU DOING?

12:02.440 --> 12:05.432
YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOT
CALLED GRANDMA, BUT I CAN

12:05.480 --> 12:09.268
ASSURE YOU THAT I WILL BE DOING
IT BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.414
- [whistling]

12:11.450 --> 12:15.238
OKAY, HERE YOU ARE.
- THANK YOU.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.525
- OKAY, WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

12:20.560 --> 12:24.974
- UH, JOE ASKED
ME TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.938
- THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S PRETTY BIG.

12:31.990 --> 12:34.390
- YEAH.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.783
- UH, WHAT ABOUT JABBAR?

12:36.820 --> 12:41.826
- OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU AND I NEED TO DISCUSS.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.407
- ARE YOU ASKING
MY PERMISSION OR--

12:43.450 --> 12:45.406
- NO, NO.

12:45.450 --> 12:50.513
JUST OPENING IT UP
FOR DISCUSSION.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.449
- WELL, THAT'S A--
A LOT OF CHANGE, YOU KNOW.

12:53.490 --> 12:59.451
WE HAVE MOVED HIM AROUND
A WHOLE LOT, THE LAST YEAR.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.493
MY OPINION, 1--
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.919
- YEAH, I--I HEAR YOU.

13:06.950 --> 13:10.260
BUT THE HOUSE
IS IN THE BERKELEY HILLS,

13:10.300 --> 13:14.088
SO HE'D STILL BE CLOSE
TO HIS FRIENDS AND TO SCHOOL

13:14.130 --> 13:15.859
AND THE HOUSE IS ACTUALLY
RIGHT UP THE STREET

13:15.890 --> 13:17.403
FROM THAT GREAT PARK
WITH, YOU KNOW, SOCCER--

13:17.450 --> 13:19.202
- SO YOU ALREADY
FOUND A HOUSE?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.162
WHY ARE WE EVEN
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION?

13:21.210 --> 13:23.417
- WELL, I DIDN'T FIND
THE HOUSE, JOE FOUND THE HOUSE.

13:23.450 --> 13:25.338
AND I HAVEN'T
SAID YES YET.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.529
HE'S BEEN LOOKING
TO BUY FOR A WHILE.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.176
AND WHETHER OR NOT
I'M INCLUDED IN THIS HOUSE

13:30.220 --> 13:31.835
IS STILL UP FOR DISCUSSION,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.359
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE A DECISION

13:33.390 --> 13:34.493
WITHOUT TALKING
TO YOU FIRST.

13:34.530 --> 13:36.350
- WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
HAVE STARTED BY SAYING,

13:36.400 --> 13:37.879
"WE FOUND A HOUSE."

13:37.920 --> 13:39.569
BECAUSE YOU DID FIND
A HOUSE, RIGHT? YOU GUYS--

13:39.610 --> 13:41.430
- CROSBY, I'M JUST TRYING
TO HAVE AN ADULT CONVERSATION

13:41.470 --> 13:42.505
HERE ABOUT THIS.

13:42.540 --> 13:46.909
THAT'S ALL.
- OKAY, OKAY.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.120
THAT'S FINE.

13:48.170 --> 13:49.569
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS
IS A LOT TO PROCESS.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.474
SO, TAKE SOME TIME,
THINK ABOUT IT,

13:51.520 --> 13:53.090
I'LL DO THE SAME,

13:53.140 --> 13:56.587
AND WE'LL COME BACK TOGETHER
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.623
AND TALK ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

13:59.660 --> 14:05.621
- OKAY.

14:05.670 --> 14:11.324
SO IS IT, UH,
IS IT NICE, THE HOUSE?

14:11.360 --> 14:16.229
- IT'S, UM--
IT'S NICE.

14:32.140 --> 14:33.448
- YOU'RE NOT ZOEY.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.481
- GUS.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

14:35.520 --> 14:36.623
- WHERE'S ZOEY?

14:36.660 --> 14:39.174
- OH, YOU MEAN THE GIRL
THAT HAD THE JOB BEFORE ME.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.494
NO IDEA.

14:40.530 --> 14:43.704
ALL I KNOW IS I'M YOUR
REGULAR COFFEE GUY, NOW.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.391
SO DO YOU
WANT ANYTHING?

14:46.430 --> 14:48.603
- NO, NO,
THANK YOU.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.924
[music playing through
headphones]

15:00.550 --> 15:02.711
- HEY.
- OH, MY GOD!

15:02.760 --> 15:05.172
YOU SCARED THE PANTS
OFF OF ME.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.438
- LISTEN, I AM SORRY.

15:06.490 --> 15:07.718
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE STILL HERE.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.409
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT'S QUIET

15:09.460 --> 15:11.178
AND LATE AT NIGHT,
IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY

15:11.220 --> 15:13.313
TIME I CAN EVER
GET ANY WORK DONE.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.146
- MY HEART.
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

15:15.190 --> 15:16.384
WHAT WAS SO FUNNY?

15:16.430 --> 15:21.629
- JUST ALL OF THESE NOTES.
I MEAN, THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.365
IT'S AMAZING.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.392
I FEEL LIKE I CAN SEE
THE WORLD THROUGH YOUR EYES.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.431
LIKE, THIS--
BUT THIS GUY LOOK,

15:28.470 --> 15:30.404
AFRAID OF JACUZZIS.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.681
I MEAN, WHAT IS THERE
TO BE AFRAID OF?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.267
GE'ITING OVERLY
RELAXED?

15:34.310 --> 15:35.618
- A LOT OF CHLORINE
IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

15:35.650 --> 15:37.299
- AH, YES, GERMS.
- I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

15:37.350 --> 15:38.419
MEETING THAT GUY.

15:38.450 --> 15:40.372
- WHAT? HOW COULD YOU
FORGET ABOUT JACUZZI GUY?

15:40.420 --> 15:42.581
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY ALL KIND OF...

15:42.630 --> 15:45.315
BLEND TOGETHER.

15:45.350 --> 15:47.386
- LIKE IN A JACUZZI.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.308
WELL, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER
JACUZZI GUY,

15:49.360 --> 15:52.636
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
YOU REMEMBER MEETING ME.

15:52.670 --> 15:57.016
- OH...

15:57.050 --> 16:01.396
I REMEMBER MEETING YOU.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.718
IT WAS RIGHT OVER THERE
BY THE COPY MACHINE.

16:05.750 --> 16:09.095
IT WAS A THURSDAY MORNING,
IT WAS YOUR FIRST DAY.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.062
I THINK YOU WERE
WEARING SOMETHING

16:11.100 --> 16:14.797
A BIT MORE PROFESSIONAL
THAN YOU ARE NOW.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.559
YOU WERE GIVING ME
A PRETTY HARD TIME ABOUT

16:16.590 --> 16:18.694
TRYING TO GET IN A FEW
QUICK COPIES IN BETWEEN

16:18.730 --> 16:21.528
YOUR MAJOR
COPYING SESSION.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.551
- MM-HMM.

16:23.600 --> 16:28.219
- SEE, NO NOTES FOR YOU.
- MM-HMM.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.490
I THINK I ALSO REMEMBER
TALKING A LOT,

16:30.540 --> 16:34.499
BECAUSE I GET A LITTLE CHATTY
WHEN I GET NERVOUS.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.531
- WHY WERE YOU NERVOUS?

16:36.580 --> 16:39.504
- BECAUSE...

16:39.550 --> 16:42.064
I GET NERVOUS...

16:42.100 --> 16:45.581
AROUND YOU.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.064
AND I JUST FEEL THE NEED

16:47.100 --> 16:50.274
TO KEEP TALKING
AND TALKING AND--

17:11.090 --> 17:13.502
- WELL, MYSTERY SOLVED.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.646
- YEAH, I MEAN,
AT LEAST SHE LEI-T A NOTE.

17:16.690 --> 17:19.090
- YEAH, SUCH ECONOMY
WITH WORDS.

17:19.140 --> 17:20.789
- JULIA, YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

17:20.830 --> 17:24.106
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT. SHE MOVED OUT.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.448
AND WE HAVE
OUR ROOM BACK.

17:25.490 --> 17:29.790
NICE TO HAVE
THE SPACE.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.422
- HON.
- YEAH.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.075
- IT'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.738
- NO, IT'S NOT
GOING TO BE OKAY.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.704
JOEL, SHE MOVED OUT.
SHE QUIT HER JOB.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.844
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.087
- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE
JUST NEEDED SOME SEPARATION.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.781
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SHE NEEDED TO
MAKE PEACE WITH THIS DECISION.

17:47.820 --> 17:50.266
- SHE WANTS TO KEEP THE BABY.
SHE'S FREAKING OUT.

18:01.140 --> 18:04.143
- IT'S QKAY.
- [crymg]

18:06.530 --> 18:07.861
- IT TURNS OUT THAT
DAWES IS CHECKING INTO

18:07.910 --> 18:10.663
THE CHAMBERLAIN HOTEL.

18:10.710 --> 18:11.802
- DAWES IS CHECKING--
HOW DO YOU KNOW

18:11.840 --> 18:13.808
THAT DAWES IS CHECKING INTO
THE CHAMBERLAIN HOTEL?

18:13.850 --> 18:15.363
- FAN TWEETED ABOUT IT.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.368
LISTEN.
- THAT'S PRETTY CREEPY.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.879
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S GOOD INTEL FOR US.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.330
JUST LISTEN TO ME,
OKAY, YOU TOLD ME

18:20.370 --> 18:21.814
THAT YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE
CALLING THEM.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.477
BUT I FIGURE, YOU'RE PROBABLY
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH

18:23.510 --> 18:25.307
FOR US TO STAGE
A RANDOM BUMP-IN

18:25.340 --> 18:26.716
AT THE HIP BAR
THERE AT THE CHAMBERLAIN.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.261
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:28.310 --> 18:29.823
- AND THEN, YOU'RE JOKING,
THIS IS A JOKE?

18:29.860 --> 18:31.794
- WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

18:31.830 --> 18:33.138
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
THE BUSINESS MOVING HERE.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.488
- YEAH, UH,
RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.748
THAT'S A GOOD START
FOR A WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.347
- CROSBY, COME ON, MAN, THIS
IS JUST ABOUT DOING BUSINESS.

18:37.390 --> 18:38.834
THAT'S ALL THIS IS.
- THIS ISN'T--

18:38.870 --> 18:40.246
I DON'T WANT TO DO BUSINESS
LIKE THIS.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.427
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS?

18:41.460 --> 18:42.939
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.561
YOU HAVE TO GO Al-TER CLIENTS.
- I DID NOT GO TO WHARTON, OKAY?

18:44.600 --> 18:45.806
BUT I'VE PLAYED MONOPOLY,
AND I DON'T REMEMBER

18:45.840 --> 18:47.489
A SQUARE ON THE BOARD
THAT SAYS

18:47.540 --> 18:48.609
"STALK FUTURE CLIENTS"

18:48.640 --> 18:51.916
OR "SCREW OVER EX-BOSSES."

18:51.950 --> 18:54.953
- MONOPOLY IS A GAME.
THIS IS REAL BUSINESS.

18:54.990 --> 18:56.059
WE ARE GOING
AFTER A CLIENT, OKAY?

18:56.100 --> 18:57.886
IT IS SINK OR SWIM
TIME FOR US, AND I AM TOSSING

18:57.920 --> 18:59.888
AND TURNING OVER
THIS STUFF EVERY NIGHT.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.545
I'VE GOT A DAUGHTER
WHO'S GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE.

19:01.580 --> 19:02.899
I'VE GOT A SON WITH SPECIAL
NEEDS, I GOT A BABY--

19:02.930 --> 19:05.160
I GOT TO KEEP THIS BUSINESS
GOING AND MAKE MONEY.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.178
THIS PLACE ISN'T GOING
TO SUCCEED ON ITS OWN, CROSBY.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.861
OKAY? WE HAVE
TO MAKE IT SUCCEED.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.515
DO YOU GET THAT?
- YEAH.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.619
YOU GOT TO MAN UP. YOU'RE
A CO-OWNER IN THIS BUSINESS.

19:13.660 --> 19:17.528
START ACTING LIKE IT.

19:24.810 --> 19:26.289

BOB SAID THAT YOU DID
SOME AMAZING THINGS FOR HIM,

19:35.720 --> 19:38.439
SO I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.232
I WAS A LITTLE BIT UNEASY
AT FIRST, BUT I THINK

19:40.280 --> 19:41.542
IT'S GOING
TO WORK OUT GREAT.

19:41.590 --> 19:42.750
- GREAT.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.893

19:56.910 --> 19:59.982
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
ALL RIGHT.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.715

20:08.750 --> 20:11.822
- LET'S SEE.

20:11.860 --> 20:12.997
- HUH?
A LITTLE RED?

20:13.030 --> 20:14.543
- TURN AROUND, TURN AROUND,
TURN AROUND.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.239
- I NEVER WEAR RED.
- IT'S CUTE.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.929
- YEAH?
- OH, YEAH, IS IT LACE?

20:17.970 --> 20:19.380
- YEAH.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.728
- THAT WORKS
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY

20:20.770 --> 20:21.930
- NO, NO, THIS ISN'T
FOR THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

20:21.970 --> 20:23.619
THIS WOULD BE
FOR DRINKS.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.524
- OH.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.731

IT'S TOO MUCH.

20:26.770 --> 20:28.874
IT MAKES ME HOT.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

20:28.910 --> 20:32.016
- HUH, FOR DRINKS,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

20:32.050 --> 20:35.360
- BECAUSE, MOM, I'M MEETING
HIS FRIENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.367

20:37.680 --> 20:40.649
YOU KNOW, WANT TO LOOK--

20:40.680 --> 20:42.545
- YOU'RE GREAT THE WAY
YOU ARE, JUST BE YOURSELF.

20:42.580 --> 20:43.956
- MOM, I'M NOT GREAT
THE WAY I AM,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.786
ALL I DO IS JUST
WEAR BLACK, AND IT'S NOT--

20:45.830 --> 20:47.582

20:47.620 --> 20:49.895
YOU ALWAYS LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
MARK LOVES YOU THE WAY YOU ARE,

20:49.930 --> 20:51.898

27:10.140 --> 27:13.348
[buzzing]

27:13.390 --> 27:16.279
- ZOEY, HI.
- HEY.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.072
- WHERE ARE YOU?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:18.110 --> 27:20.044
- LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
I FELL OFF THE GRID.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.900
I'VE JUST BEEN DEALING
WITH SOME STUFF AND, UM,

27:21.950 --> 27:25.420
I WAS HAVING SOME PAINS
SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR.

27:25.470 --> 27:28.359
- WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

27:28.400 --> 27:32.359
- I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED,
"AN INCOMPETENT CERVIX."

27:32.400 --> 27:33.674
PRETTY GREAT, RIGHT?

27:33.720 --> 27:36.029
EVEN MY CERVIX
IS INCOMPETENT.

27:36.060 --> 27:39.712
HE PUT ME ON BED REST,
SO I HAD TO QUIT MY JOB

27:39.760 --> 27:41.967
AND NOW I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT, 50--

27:42.000 --> 27:43.444
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP?

27:43.480 --> 27:45.482
- NO, NO, I CAN--
I GOT IT.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.930
I JUST HAD TO APPLY
FOR DISABILITY

27:46.970 --> 27:48.346
AND DO ALL THE PAPERWORK
AND--

27:48.390 --> 27:49.891
- YEAH, I CAN--
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.077
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

27:51.110 --> 27:54.898
I CAN HANDLE IT.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.874
- OKAY.
- ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO GO.

27:56.910 --> 27:58.320
I SHOULD GO, OKAY?

27:58.360 --> 27:59.497
- WELL, ZOEY, ZOEY,
UM, JUST

27:59.530 --> 28:02.397
WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO MOVE OUT?

28:02.430 --> 28:05.319
UM, I MEAN, YOU'RE
EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT,

28:05.370 --> 28:07.395
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT CAN'T BE EASY

28:07.440 --> 28:10.091
TO DEAL WITH ROOMMATES
AND RENT.

28:10.130 --> 28:11.927
- ACTUALLY, MY ROOMMATES
ARE REALLY GREAT

28:11.960 --> 28:14.019
AND I'M GOING TO PAY
MY RENT WITH MY DISABILITY, SO--

28:14.070 --> 28:16.300
YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST GOING TO START

28:16.340 --> 28:18.035
TAKING CARE OF MYSELF
FOR A CHANGE.

28:18.070 --> 28:20.379
- RIGHT, WELL--

28:20.420 --> 28:23.719
- I GO'ITA GO.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.212
- HOW DOES IT FEEL?
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

28:31.260 --> 28:32.454
- IT'S JUST A PROMOTION,
MOM.

28:32.500 --> 28:36.118
- NO, IT'S NOT, UH--
DID YOU GET THE FLOWERS?

28:36.160 --> 28:40.051
- THEY'RE VERY NICE,
I'M LOOKING AT THEM RIGHT NOW.

28:40.090 --> 28:41.534
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT, MOM.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.502

28:46.200 --> 28:47.508
- IT'S HONESTLY
NOT A BIG DEAL, OKAY?

28:47.550 --> 28:49.268
IT'S JUST LUCKY.

28:49.310 --> 28:55.249
- HONEY, YOU'RE SPECIAL,

28:55.280 --> 28:58.864

29:11.500 --> 29:15.846

IN HIS OFFICE.

29:22.650 --> 29:27.792
- OH, UM, YOU KNOW,
I WAS ACTUALLY JUST LEAVING.

29:27.830 --> 29:30.378

29:30.420 --> 29:33.173

30:28.480 --> 30:30.095
- NOT A GOOD PLACE?

30:30.130 --> 30:32.337
- WELL, UH, YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T FOR ME.

30:32.380 --> 30:33.199
IT WAS NOT A GOOD FIT.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.037
IT'S PRETTY CORPORATE
OVER THERE.

30:35.070 --> 30:37.584
THEY, UH, YOU KNOW,
WEREN'T GREAT WITH FANS,

30:37.620 --> 30:39.178
ALL ABOUT THE BO'ITOM-LINE.

30:39.210 --> 30:43.385
I DIDN'T LOVE IT, SO I STARTED
MY OWN PLACE, ACTUALLY.

30:43.420 --> 30:44.626
- WHY, WHAT'S, UH--?

30:44.670 --> 30:46.524
- WE'RE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING
RECORDING THERE.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.528
- OH, OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S AWKWARD.

30:48.570 --> 30:50.424
I TAKE IT BACK THEN.

30:50.460 --> 30:52.109
- WELL, WHAT'S THE DEAL
OVER THERE?

30:52.160 --> 30:53.320
BECAUSE WE'RE, LIKE,
MINUTES AWAY

30:53.360 --> 30:54.224
FROM SIGNING
THE DO'ITED LINE.

30:54.260 --> 30:56.182

I THINK.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.078
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH IT.

31:16.110 --> 31:17.486
I'M GOING TO GET BACK

31:17.530 --> 31:19.213
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

31:19.250 --> 31:22.424

31:22.460 --> 31:25.349
HOW'D IT GO?
- I CAN'T DO IT.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.186
THEY MET BRENT
AND THEY LIKE HIM AND NOW--

31:27.230 --> 31:28.458
- IT'S OKAY, LET'S GET THE
CHECK, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.491
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU

31:30.540 --> 31:32.428
EXCUSE ME.
- HEY, GUYS.

31:32.470 --> 31:34.335
HEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO BUG YOU GUYS.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.509
UM, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE
THERE WAS SOMETHING

31:36.540 --> 31:37.643
YOU WEREN'T
SAYING BACK THERE.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.376
WHICH I RESPECT, NOT TALKING
TRASH ANOTHER STUDIO.

31:40.410 --> 31:42.332
BUT THIS ALBUM'S
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US.

31:42.380 --> 31:44.473
WE WERE WONDERING IF WE COULD
MAYBE BUY YOU A DRINK.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.512
- UH...

31:47.560 --> 31:48.481

- THANK YOU.

31:52.420 --> 31:53.591
- YEAH, WE GOT TIME
FOR A QUICK ONE.

31:53.630 --> 31:56.428
LET'S CLOSE OUT THIS CHECK
AND GRAB A TABLE, ALL RIGHT?

31:56.460 --> 31:59.213
ALL RIGHT.
- [QUIPS]

31:59.260 --> 32:03.117
[knock on door]

32:03.160 --> 32:05.151
- HEY.
- HEY.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.670
- I, UH, I HEARD
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL.

32:07.710 --> 32:13.478
SO I THOUGHT
I'D BRING SOME SOUP.

32:13.510 --> 32:18.095
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN...

32:18.140 --> 32:20.995
DO THIS...

32:21.040 --> 32:24.032
AND WORK FOR YOU.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.513
I DON'T KNOW.

32:25.560 --> 32:30.008
YOU KNOW, MY AUNT GAVE ME
THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY,

32:30.050 --> 32:31.449
AND I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
- AMBER.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.663
- ALSO, I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

32:34.710 --> 32:36.280
DID YOU GIVE ME
THIS JOB

32:36.330 --> 32:38.491
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I WOULD BE GOOD AT IT,

32:38.540 --> 32:41.748
OR BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO SLEEP WITH ME?

32:46.550 --> 32:49.610
- YOU ARE SMART
AND YOU ARE FUNNY

32:49.650 --> 32:51.208
AND YOU THINK
FOR YOURSELF.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.585
THAT'S WHY
I GAVE YOU THE JOB, AMBER.

32:54.620 --> 32:59.762
AND TO BE HONEST,
THAT'S WHY I KISSED YOU.

32:59.800 --> 33:03.281
YOU ARE TOUGH,

33:03.320 --> 33:07.074
BUT YOU HAVE THIS
VULNERABILITY ABOUT YOU

33:07.120 --> 33:12.012
THAT IS JUST INCREDIBLE.

33:12.050 --> 33:15.156
SO I HOPE YOU WILL
COME BACK TO WORK.

33:26.550 --> 33:28.472
TRY THE SOUP.

33:30.350 --> 33:32.170
[door opens]

33:38.630 --> 33:40.689
- HEY.
- HEY.

33:40.740 --> 33:42.526
- YOU DID IT.

33:42.570 --> 33:45.038
- UH-OH.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.398

33:46.430 --> 33:47.465
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.842
- DID YOU TAKE A CAB?
WHAT--

33:48.880 --> 33:50.438
OH, YOU'RE COMING HERE?

34:01.550 --> 34:04.758
WE GOT DAWES.
- AH.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.483
- VICTORY IS OURS.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.340
DID YOU TAKE BART HERE?

34:08.390 --> 34:09.869
- HEY, I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO DO SOMETHING

34:09.900 --> 34:13.210
THAT MADE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

34:13.250 --> 34:16.356
- HMM. IT'S OKAY.

34:16.390 --> 34:18.529
IT'S JUST PART
OF BEING AN ADULT.

34:18.570 --> 34:22.188
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

34:22.230 --> 34:26.439
LIKE, HORRIBLE THINGS.

34:26.470 --> 34:29.098
LIKE DRINK SCOTCH.
YOU KNOW,

34:29.130 --> 34:31.781
WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU HAVE
TO DRINK SCOTCH, AND IT SUCKS.

34:31.820 --> 34:35.096
- IT SUCKS.
- AND SO DOES--

34:35.140 --> 34:38.200
SO DOES SELLING
YOUR FRIENDS OUT, THAT SUCKS.

34:38.240 --> 34:42.199
PRETENDING YOU DON'T CARE
YOUR EX-FIANCEE'S MOVING IN

34:42.250 --> 34:46.869
WITH HER BOYFRIEND SUCKS,
IT ALL SUCKS, REALLY.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.492
- JASMINE'S MOVING IN
WITH JOE?

34:49.530 --> 34:53.421
- YEAH, IT'S NOT GOING
TO LAST, I KNOW IT.

34:53.470 --> 34:55.870
SO ORIGINAL, JOE TOO,
HE BOUGHT HER A HOUSE.

34:55.920 --> 34:59.504
I MEAN, IS--IS--
I HOPE HE BOUGHT INSURANCE,

34:59.540 --> 35:01.576
BECAUSE I BOUGHT HER
A HOUSE BEFORE

35:01.610 --> 35:04.477
AND SHE STILL
BROKE MY HEART.

35:04.510 --> 35:07.809
SO, GOOD LUCK, JOE.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.580
YOU'RE REALLY NICE,
LILLY.

35:19.220 --> 35:20.790
- SINCE I SAW YOU THIS MORNING,
I'VE BEEN READING UP

35:20.840 --> 35:23.877
ON KEROUAC BECAUSE I, UM--

35:23.910 --> 35:26.424
YOU TOLD ME HE SPENT
SOME TIME IN MOROCCO AND

35:26.460 --> 35:28.428
EMBARRASSINGLY ENOUGH,
AS AN ENGLISH TEACHER,

35:28.470 --> 35:30.916
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

35:30.950 --> 35:33.293
BUT THEN, I FOUND OUT
THAT WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS

35:33.330 --> 35:35.537
LIVED IN MOROCCO TOO,
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

35:35.580 --> 35:39.402
- I DID.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.919
- WE SHOULD DO THAT.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.575
JUST LEAVE THE COUNTRY
FOR A YEAR,

35:42.620 --> 35:46.340
BE AN EXPAT FOR AWHILE,
WE COULD GO TO MOROCCO

35:46.380 --> 35:48.302
AND RENT A CHEAP,
LI'ITLE APARTMENT.

35:48.350 --> 35:49.556
AND YOU COULD WORK
ON YOUR WRITING.

35:49.590 --> 35:51.444
I COULD, UH,
I DON'T KNOW.

35:51.490 --> 35:52.457
- CAN YOU PULL
THE CAR OVER?

35:52.490 --> 35:53.582
CAN YOU PULL OVER?

35:53.630 --> 35:57.862

36:03.920 --> 36:09.881
SARAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:09.920 --> 36:15.233
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

36:15.270 --> 36:17.579
- I'M 40.

36:17.620 --> 36:20.544
- I-I KNOW.

36:20.590 --> 36:23.866
- I'M AFRAID IF WE WAIT,

36:23.900 --> 36:26.175
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

36:29.010 --> 36:33.458
IF WE WANT A BABY,
WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW.

36:33.500 --> 36:38.016
AND I DON'T WANT
TO PUT THAT PRESSURE ON YOU.

36:38.050 --> 36:42.532
I DON'T WANT TO FEEL
LIKE I'M WRECKING YOUR DREAMS.

36:42.570 --> 36:43.571
- YOU'RE NOT.

36:43.610 --> 36:47.228
- YOU SHOULD GO
TO MOROCCO IF YOU WANT TO GO.

36:47.270 --> 36:50.785
- I DON'T NEED TO GO
TO MOROCCO, I JUST WAS--

36:54.860 --> 36:57.340
I'M--I'M READY.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.348
I DON'T NEED TO DO
ANY OF THAT OTHER STUFF.

36:59.380 --> 37:03.487
I LOVE YOU.

37:03.530 --> 37:06.249
AND IF WE HAVE TO HAVE
A BABY NOW,

37:06.290 --> 37:11.842
THEN LET'S DO IT.

37:11.880 --> 37:15.498
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

37:15.540 --> 37:18.668
- MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW.

37:36.110 --> 37:40.809
- IF I STOP TOO LONG
TO THINK

37:44.710 --> 37:47.326
NOTHING GOOD
CAN COME FROM THAT...

37:47.360 --> 37:49.294
- HI.
- GOOD MORNING, AMBER.

37:49.330 --> 37:50.672
HOW ARE YOU?

37:50.710 --> 37:52.086
- I'M GOOD.

37:52.130 --> 37:56.089
- GOOD ENOUGH
TO DIVE RIGHT BACK IN?

37:56.130 --> 37:58.997
- ABSOLUTELY.

38:04.900 --> 38:10.691
NOTHING IS GONNA BRING
US DOWN

38:17.010 --> 38:19.945
- THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE ON BED REST?

38:21.950 --> 38:24.919
- YEAH, WELL,
MY ASSISTANT TOOK THE DAY OFF.

38:24.950 --> 38:26.326
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, RIGHT?

38:26.370 --> 38:27.530
- HERE.
- OH, I GOT IT, IT'S FINE.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.787
- NO, NO,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

38:34.410 --> 38:36.787
- SO, I GUESS JULIA TOLD YOU

38:36.830 --> 38:38.752
ABOUT THE INCOMPETENT
CERVIX THING?

38:38.790 --> 38:41.588
BUT SERIOUSLY,
I'M FINE, YOU KNOW.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.826
SO, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

38:42.870 --> 38:44.861
- HEY, LOOK, LOOK.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.789
JULIA DOESN'T
KNOW I'M HERE.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.900
BUT THERE'S A QUESTION
I GOT TO ASK YOU.

38:50.940 --> 38:53.113
AND MY WIFE'S
TOO SCARED TO,

38:53.150 --> 38:57.803
BUT I'M TOO SCARED NOT TO.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.943
- OKAY.

38:59.990 --> 39:03.915
- ARE YOU CHANGING
YOUR MIND ABOUT THE BABY?

39:03.960 --> 39:06.815
- NO.
- NO?

39:06.860 --> 39:11.638
- NO.
- YOU'RE SURE? JUST BE HONEST.

39:11.690 --> 39:14.067
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD,
BUT IF, I MEAN,

39:14.110 --> 39:17.170
IF WE COULD GO MUCH FURTHER
INTO THIS, MY WIFE IS JUST

39:17.210 --> 39:22.659
GOING TO--IT'S GOING
TO TEAR HER APART, ZOEY.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.521
- OKAY, WELL, I'M NOT
CHANGING MY MIND.

39:25.570 --> 39:27.071
- OKAY, THEN WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?

39:27.120 --> 39:31.011
WHY'D YOU MOVE OUT?

39:31.050 --> 39:34.178
- BECAUSE
I NEED MY OWN SPACE.

39:34.230 --> 39:35.879
THIS IS WHY I WANTED
A CLOSED ADOPTION

39:35.920 --> 39:37.979
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND I TOLD HER THAT.

39:38.030 --> 39:40.191
I NEED MY OWN SPACE.
I NEED TO BE SEPARATE.

39:40.230 --> 39:45.759
THE BABY'S GOING TO COME
AND THEN WHAT?

39:45.790 --> 39:48.850
- I UNDERSTAND.
- DO YOU?

39:48.900 --> 39:50.106
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?

39:50.140 --> 39:52.859
- I'M FINE.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.583
- HERE, JUST--
HERE'S SOME--

39:54.630 --> 39:55.938
HERE'S 3O BUCKS.

39:55.970 --> 39:56.766
- I DON'T NEED
YOUR MONEY, OKAY?

39:56.800 --> 40:00.759
- JUST TAKE IT ANYWAY,
WOULD YOU?

40:00.810 --> 40:04.189
- I'M GOING TO BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

40:09.750 --> 40:11.058
- DADDY!

40:11.090 --> 40:13.786
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU,
LITTLE MAN?

40:13.820 --> 40:14.957
- GOOD.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.639
- HOW ARE YOU,
LI'ITLE MAN'S MOM?

40:16.690 --> 40:18.783
- I'M GOOD, YOU MIND
IF I COME IN FOR A MINUTE?

40:18.830 --> 40:21.822
- YEAH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ASK. COME ON IN.

40:21.860 --> 40:24.169
- SWEETIE, CAN YOU GO PLAY
SO I CAN TALK TO YOUR DAD?

40:24.210 --> 40:27.725
- OKAY, MOMMY.

40:27.770 --> 40:29.931
- HOUSE LOOKS GOOD.

40:29.970 --> 40:32.598
- THANK YOU, I, UH, FINALLY
GOT AROUND TO DECORATING IT.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.734
OR RATHER,
MY MOM DECORATED IT.

40:34.770 --> 40:37.830
SAME DIFFERENCE--I CAN'T TAKE
CREDIT FOR THE THROW PILLOWS.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.804
- THOSE ARE NICE.
POTTERY BARN?

40:44.020 --> 40:46.648
- IS THAT WHAT YOU CAME OVER
TO TALK ABOUT, POTTERY BARN?

40:46.680 --> 40:49.854
- NO.
- WHAT'S UP?

40:49.890 --> 40:55.851
- I WANT
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

40:55.900 --> 41:00.064
- OKAY.

41:00.110 --> 41:01.964
- OKAY?

41:02.010 --> 41:04.478
- YEAH, OKAY.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.862
- ANYTHING ELSE?

41:06.910 --> 41:09.902
- UM, CONGRATULATIONS.

41:09.950 --> 41:11.144
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN.

41:11.190 --> 41:15.638
- LOOK, YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YANKING JABBAR AROUND.

41:15.680 --> 41:18.911
SO, IF YOU'RE SAYING IT'S
SERIOUS, I TRUST YOU.

41:18.950 --> 41:21.817
- UH, WE STILL HAVE
SOME WORK LEI-T TO DO.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.738
THERE'S A 30-DAY ESCROW,
SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT

41:23.790 --> 41:25.018
HOLDING OFF ON
TELLING HIM

41:25.060 --> 41:27.199
UNTIL WE'RE CLOSER
TO THE MOVE-IN DATE.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.992
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR HIM TO PROCESS THINGS

41:29.030 --> 41:30.998
UNTIL THEY'RE HAPPENING.
- RIGHT.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.929
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

41:33.970 --> 41:36.131
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

41:36.180 --> 41:40.765
- WELL, THANKS FOR, UH,
BEING MATURE ABOUT THIS.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.973
- YOU'RE WEL--
OH, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

41:43.010 --> 41:45.217
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

41:57.230 --> 41:59.539
- IS THIS A DOOR KNOB?

41:59.580 --> 42:04.927
- YEAH, BUT THESE ARE THE ENDS
OF A BALLET BAR THAT I FOUND.

42:04.970 --> 42:09.339
I MADE IT FOR YOU
WHEN I WAS REDOING THE HOUSE

42:09.380 --> 42:11.553
BUT, UM, I NEVER GOT AROUND
TO PU'ITING IT ON THE DOOR.

42:11.590 --> 42:16.596
SO, IF YOU LIKE IT--
- I LOVE IT.

42:16.630 --> 42:19.007
- WELL, THINK OF IT
AS A HOUSEWARMING GIl-T.
