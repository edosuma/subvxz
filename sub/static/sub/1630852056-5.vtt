00:01.734 --> 00:03.467
See, he picks up the brick there.

00:03.533 --> 00:04.934
He punched me in my face.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.667
He's refusing to leave.

00:06.734 --> 00:08.767
Just a second, he was leaving.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.800
He's telling me, "Come
at me, bro, come at me."

00:11.867 --> 00:12.867
Oh, that's ridiculous.

00:12.934 --> 00:15.834
You both behaved badly.
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.767
[narrator] <i>This is </i>Judy Justice.

00:18.834 --> 00:22.000
[theme music]

00:34.700 --> 00:38.767
<i>Danny Martinez and his fiancée,</i>
<i>Alexandra Sanchez-Mar</i>

00:38.834 --> 00:44.367
<i>are suing Brandon Alvarez</i>
<i>for trespassing and an assault.</i>

00:44.433 --> 00:47.000
[Kevin] Court, come to order,
all rise.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.500
-Have a seat please.
-Good morning, judge.

00:52.567 --> 00:55.567
We have case 1033, Martinez,
Sanchez-Mar versus Alvarez.

00:55.633 --> 00:56.834
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.500
[Judy] Your last
name is Sanchez?

00:58.567 --> 00:59.567
-Mine.
-My fiancée.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.800
-And you're his fiancée?
-Yes.

01:01.867 --> 01:03.934
Why don't you have
a seat for a moment?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.667
Because this case is really
about you, Mr. Martinez,

01:07.734 --> 01:10.800
your fiancée was
witness to these events

01:10.867 --> 01:14.200
and may have been, according
to you, traumatized by them,

01:14.266 --> 01:16.033
but this really
involves the two of you.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.066
-That'd be a fair statement?
-Correct.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.233
Let me see if I understand,

01:20.300 --> 01:23.767
-you have in your home a music studio?
-Yes.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.834
Is it in the basement
or on the main level?

01:25.900 --> 01:26.867
It's in my son's room.

01:26.934 --> 01:28.467
-How old is he?
-He's four.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.500
-And that's where you do--
-That's where I record.

01:30.567 --> 01:31.600
That's where you record.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.567
-You had a friend?
-Correct.

01:33.633 --> 01:37.367
You and your friend were
doing music together?

01:37.433 --> 01:38.500
That's correct, Your Honor.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.800
And at some point you
became acquainted,

01:40.867 --> 01:42.467
because you were
acquainted

01:42.533 --> 01:44.867
-with this friend...
-With the artist, uh-huh.

01:44.934 --> 01:48.000
and you decided that
you and your friend

01:48.066 --> 01:51.200
would like to use
his son's room,

01:51.266 --> 01:53.900
that doubles as a
recording studio

01:53.967 --> 01:55.867
to work with him and
record some music?

01:55.934 --> 01:58.300
-Correct.
-So you started to work together

01:58.367 --> 02:00.233
and then you and your
friend had a falling-out?

02:00.300 --> 02:02.967
-Correct.
-Prior to you having a falling-out,

02:03.033 --> 02:05.500
according to your
answer and counterclaim,

02:05.567 --> 02:07.600
-you purchased a microphone--
-That's correct.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.800
to use in recording.

02:09.867 --> 02:12.734
You acknowledge that he
purchased a microphone

02:12.800 --> 02:16.567
that he brought to your
son's room-slash-playroom.

02:16.633 --> 02:20.233
After you and your friend
decided after this falling-out,

02:20.300 --> 02:22.000
and you were aware that
there was a falling-out?

02:22.066 --> 02:25.066
-Yes.
-You stopped going to the studio?

02:25.133 --> 02:26.700
-That's correct.
-Your Honor, if I may,

02:26.767 --> 02:29.533
I've only-- I had been to the studio
about two or three times.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.834
It's just, I work a lot,
I work 12-hour shifts.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.133
No, no, no, listen to me,

02:33.200 --> 02:34.900
don't give me a lot
of editorializing.

02:34.967 --> 02:40.066
If anything that I said is wrong,
tell me. Don't enhance it.

02:40.133 --> 02:41.533
I don't need
enhancing right now,

02:41.600 --> 02:45.066
I'm trying to set the stage
of what this case is about.

02:45.133 --> 02:46.100
-Correct.
-Okay?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.200
Correct.

02:47.266 --> 02:50.600
So you and your friend split up
and you decided

02:50.667 --> 02:53.200
that you weren't going
back to the studio anymore,

02:53.266 --> 02:56.800
or you decided that you
would continue working

02:56.867 --> 02:59.967
with this friend. Let's--
'cause I feel peculiar about it,

03:00.100 --> 03:02.500
let's call your friend Steve.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.633
-Correct, well, sure.
-[Whitney stifles laughter]

03:04.700 --> 03:06.433
Now I feel more comfortable.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.567
-So you continue to work with Steve?
-Yes.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.767
At some point, you wanted
your microphone back.

03:12.834 --> 03:13.800
That's correct.

03:13.867 --> 03:17.667
And you communicated
that fact to Mr. Martinez?

03:17.734 --> 03:18.767
That is correct.

03:18.834 --> 03:22.166
Mr. Martinez said he sort
of felt uncomfortable,

03:22.233 --> 03:24.400
'cause he's still
working with Steve.

03:24.967 --> 03:28.767
So he says he gave
the microphone

03:28.834 --> 03:31.433
-to Steve to give back to you?
-Yes.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.467
-Your Honor, that--
-[banging bench]

03:34.533 --> 03:36.600
I'm just telling
you what's in here.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.300
-Okay.
-According to you,

03:38.367 --> 03:40.934
Mr. Alvarez, this is your claim,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.133
trespassed on your property

03:43.200 --> 03:46.300
in order to get
his microphone back,

03:46.767 --> 03:51.000
and in the process
assaulted you seriously

03:51.066 --> 03:53.066
in front of your fiancée,

03:53.133 --> 03:55.500
which is why she was
standing up next to you,

03:55.567 --> 03:57.467
and your four-year-old son?

03:57.533 --> 03:58.867
-[Danny] Yes.
-Traumatizing them.

03:58.934 --> 03:59.934
Yes.

04:00.066 --> 04:02.333
Mr. Alvarez has a
cross complaint.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.200
He says he did in fact
come to your house,

04:05.266 --> 04:07.233
because you stopped
returning his calls,

04:07.567 --> 04:09.800
to retrieve his
expensive microphone

04:09.867 --> 04:12.900
and you, in fact, assaulted him

04:12.967 --> 04:15.467
and he's got a counterclaim
for that assault.

04:15.533 --> 04:16.834
That's what this case is about.

04:16.900 --> 04:17.834
That's correct.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.867
-Alright.
-That is correct.

04:18.934 --> 04:22.967
[claps] So we have a claim
of assault, a claim of assault

04:23.033 --> 04:25.567
and also you want
your microphone back,

04:25.633 --> 04:26.667
-and--
-Uh-huh.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.700
And you have a
claim of trespass?

04:28.767 --> 04:30.633
Did you get your microphone
back, by the way?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.433
I received my mic, but not
my other piece of equipment.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.033
I don't care about other
piece of equipment.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.400
From whom did you
get the microphone?

04:37.467 --> 04:39.200
Well, the person
that you claimed,

04:39.266 --> 04:40.767
that I'm not friends
with anymore, Steve,

04:40.834 --> 04:43.600
-I'm still friends with Steve.
-Steve, that's it. [claps]

04:43.667 --> 04:45.600
-Mm-hm.
-You got it back from Steve?

04:45.667 --> 04:46.667
Yes.

04:46.734 --> 04:49.567
Did you get it back from
Steve before or after

04:49.633 --> 04:51.934
this altercation
between the two of you?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.367
After the altercation.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.567
Okay, so after the altercation,

04:55.633 --> 04:58.333
how much after the
altercation, a day, two?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.800
It was a week, it was a week.
It was a week.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.333
A week, so now we're just
talking about assault.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.867
So on what day, sir, do you
allege this assault took place?

05:05.934 --> 05:07.400
May 15th, 2021.

05:07.467 --> 05:09.100
-What time of the day?
-One p.m.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.433
-At your home?
-At my home.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.467
Fiancée and son were there?

05:12.533 --> 05:13.633
-Yes.
-I'm listening.

05:13.700 --> 05:17.367
Okay, so they ended up,
Steve and Brandon ended,

05:17.433 --> 05:18.567
oh, May 15th?

05:18.633 --> 05:20.166
-Get to May 15th.
-May 15th, I--

05:20.233 --> 05:22.400
-I just laid out the case.
-At 1:00 p.m.--

05:22.467 --> 05:24.400
Just a second,
was it clear to you?

05:24.467 --> 05:25.467
Pretty clear.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.133
-Was it clear to you?
-Very clear.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.667
Got it, I just want to know,
because you're my ears

05:30.734 --> 05:35.633
to the tens of millions
of people who are

05:35.700 --> 05:39.567
All I want is what happened,
you had the microphone,

05:39.633 --> 05:43.934
you gave it to Steve,
you shouldn't have given it to Steve,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.867
should've given it directly
back to him, it was a mistake.

05:47.934 --> 05:49.600
-You cut him off.
-Yes.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.533
You didn't return his calls.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.767
Now he comes to your house
May 15th, 1:00 p.m.

05:55.834 --> 05:56.800
[claps]

05:56.867 --> 05:57.900
Pick it up from there.

05:57.967 --> 06:01.533
May 15th at 1:00 p.m., he...

06:01.600 --> 06:04.066
Me and my fiancée are in
the yard, we're hanging out.

06:04.133 --> 06:07.867
We noticed Brandon
pulling up to the gate,

06:07.934 --> 06:10.967
right off the bat saying,
"Yo, rebel, what's my mic at?"

06:11.033 --> 06:12.834
Pulled up to what gate? Is there a--?

06:12.900 --> 06:14.867
It's a side gate that
leads to our home,

06:14.934 --> 06:16.700
-we live in a side home.
-Okay.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.433
Pulled up to the gate,
was anybody with him?

06:19.500 --> 06:20.700
He had a driver with him.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.066
Somebody was driving the car?

06:22.133 --> 06:23.200
-Yeah.
-Okay.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.767
So he immediately
lets himself in.

06:25.834 --> 06:26.900
[Judy] You mean opened the gate?

06:26.967 --> 06:29.800
Yeah, he opens the gate,
immediately lets himself in,

06:29.867 --> 06:31.867
immediately started
asking for his equipment.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.800
I respond by telling him,
"I don't have your stuff,

06:34.867 --> 06:37.367
you know, Steve has your stuff,
you need to leave,

06:37.433 --> 06:39.433
'cause, you know,
no one let you in."

06:39.500 --> 06:41.266
As I'm walking towards him,
I'm telling him.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.834
As you're walking towards him?

06:42.900 --> 06:44.000
As I'm walking towards him,

06:44.066 --> 06:47.166
he's continuing
to refuse to leave.

06:47.233 --> 06:50.000
No, no, tell me as you're
walking towards him,

06:50.066 --> 06:52.700
what he said to you
and what you said to him.

06:52.767 --> 06:53.800
I'm telling him,
"Get outta here."

06:53.867 --> 06:56.233
He's saying,
"No, give me my stuff."

06:56.300 --> 06:58.934
At that point, you know.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.133
Now at that point?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.033
I'm trying to shove him out.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.800
Okay, so we're going frame by frame.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.867
-Yes.
-He's in your yard.

07:07.934 --> 07:10.567
He's let himself in,
he wants his stuff.

07:10.633 --> 07:12.500
-You say, "Get out of here."
-Yes. Yes.

07:12.567 --> 07:14.700
-You start shoving him out.
-Yes.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.834
Is that what you said?

07:15.900 --> 07:16.867
Yes.

07:16.934 --> 07:18.333
[Judy] How did you
start shoving him out?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.900
I just put one hand
on him and tell him,

07:19.967 --> 07:21.600
"Hey man, get out of here,
you need to leave."

07:21.667 --> 07:23.734
Okay, well, first you
picked up two hands,

07:23.800 --> 07:27.133
did you pick up two hands,
that's what you picked up first?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.367
It was one hand.

07:28.433 --> 07:29.800
[Judy] One hand, you
put your hands on him?

07:29.867 --> 07:30.867
-Yes.
-And say,

07:30.934 --> 07:31.967
-"Hey, man, get out of here?"
-Yes.

07:32.033 --> 07:33.266
And then what happened?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.300
And then he's refusing to leave,

07:35.367 --> 07:36.600
he's still refusing to leave.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.734
Just a second,
what happened next?

07:38.800 --> 07:40.734
I try to keep shoving him again.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.467
Okay, just a second,
so you're shoving him now

07:44.533 --> 07:46.867
with one hand or two?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.266
I believe with two hands.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.567
Okay, so now you're shoving
him back towards the fence?

07:51.633 --> 07:52.633
Towards the fence.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.100
-Telling him to leave?
-Yes.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.667
-What's next?
-At that point,

07:55.734 --> 07:57.266
he gets very aggressive.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.166
No, just a second, just
tell me what happened.

08:00.233 --> 08:03.700
You're shoving him now with two
hands back towards the fence

08:03.767 --> 08:06.834
and probably exchanging
words, he wants his stuff,

08:06.900 --> 08:10.500
"Get outta here," lots of--
probably lots of bad language.

08:10.567 --> 08:13.667
You're shoving him out.
What happened next?

08:13.734 --> 08:15.500
He punches me in my face.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.567
Okay, so he punched you
and then what happened?

08:18.633 --> 08:20.100
At that point, I'm stunned.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.066
I'm like, "What's that for?
What was that for?"

08:22.133 --> 08:23.633
And then he's still saying,

08:23.700 --> 08:25.300
"You have my mic,
give me my mic."

08:25.367 --> 08:27.633
So at that point,
my wife grabs a brick,

08:27.700 --> 08:28.767
because she feels in danger.

08:28.834 --> 08:31.333
Just-- Just-- don't-- don't,
I don't care what she feels.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.000
-Your wife picks up a brick?
-Yes.

08:34.066 --> 08:37.166
And what does she do
when she picks up the brick?

08:37.233 --> 08:39.800
She's verbally telling him,
"Get outta here."

08:39.867 --> 08:41.734
She picks up a brick
and she's saying to him,

08:41.800 --> 08:43.066
-"Get out of here?"
-"Get out of here."

08:43.133 --> 08:45.266
She's pointing at him, leave.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.767
Pointing at him,
"Get out of here."

08:46.834 --> 08:49.367
-Mm-hm.
-And how far from the gate was he?

08:49.433 --> 08:52.734
-When he was backing up?
-Yes.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.166
So when he started backing up,

08:54.233 --> 08:56.400
when he noticed my wife
picked up the brick,

08:56.467 --> 08:58.467
he was still at the gate,

08:58.533 --> 09:00.633
he was still, like,
in between the gate, so...

09:00.700 --> 09:02.767
-So he's still--
-Yeah,

09:02.834 --> 09:04.500
-he's still at the gate.
-Just a sec.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.734
So when you were pushing
him, was he at the gate?

09:07.800 --> 09:08.934
No, he was in my property.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.633
How many feet was he
in the yard?

09:11.700 --> 09:12.767
Ten feet, 10 feet
inside the yard.

09:12.834 --> 09:16.367
10 feet, so he was backing up
as you were pushing him,

09:16.433 --> 09:18.266
because now you say
he's at the gate,

09:18.333 --> 09:20.333
when your wife
picks up the brick,

09:20.400 --> 09:22.734
-that's what you just said?
-Yes.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.700
Yeah, I pushed him
initially so he can leave,

09:25.767 --> 09:28.266
but then he got
aggressive, punched me.

09:28.333 --> 09:29.834
-Well, I want to know where.
-Yeah.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.400
Where was he when
he punched you?

09:32.467 --> 09:34.266
-In my yard, 10 feet in.
-No.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.600
-10 feet in?
-Yeah.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.834
But at some point,
he got to the gate,

09:37.900 --> 09:40.467
because you said your
wife picked up a brick

09:40.533 --> 09:43.500
and at that point, he
was just inside the gate.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.033
-Yeah.
-Not 10 feet in,

09:45.100 --> 09:47.700
so he had backed up
and I want to know

09:47.767 --> 09:49.867
if he backed up because
of your shoving him

09:49.934 --> 09:53.233
or if he walked back
backwards towards the gate.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.467
He's walking back
towards the gate.

09:55.533 --> 09:58.767
Is that because of momentum,
because you're shoving him

09:58.834 --> 10:00.433
or is he walking himself back?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
He's gonna have a
whole different story,

10:02.567 --> 10:05.667
but I'm paying careful
attention to your story.

10:05.734 --> 10:08.567
Yeah. Yes, he-- he starts backing up,

10:08.633 --> 10:12.200
because he notices my
wife pick up a brick.

10:12.266 --> 10:14.767
I'm still telling him,
"You need to leave,"

10:14.834 --> 10:17.233
as he's backing up
towards the gate.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.567
I'm not shoving him
anymore at this point,

10:19.633 --> 10:22.500
I'm still telling him, still
giving him a chance to leave.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.967
Okay, so now he's--
now he's at the gate.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.467
-Mm-hm.
-And you and your wife

10:26.533 --> 10:28.266
are 10 feet away,

10:28.333 --> 10:30.934
'cause he's already punched you,
according to you,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.233
he's already punched you
and he's backing up,

10:34.300 --> 10:35.800
not because you're shoving him,

10:35.867 --> 10:39.400
but because what you said
was he saw your wife,

10:39.467 --> 10:41.767
he saw your wife
pick up the brick,

10:41.834 --> 10:44.700
so he was walking himself,
'cause you stopped shoving him?

10:44.767 --> 10:46.066
That's what you just told me.

10:46.433 --> 10:47.367
[quietly] Is that--?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.033
-[quietly] Think so.
-[Judy chuckles softly]

10:50.767 --> 10:52.767
-See why Whitney is so important?
-[Danny] Yeah.

10:52.834 --> 10:55.066
He said, "When he noticed
my wife picked up the brick,

10:55.133 --> 10:57.333
he was still at the gate,
he was still in between the gate."

10:57.400 --> 11:00.433
-[Danny] Yes.
-So now he's between the gate?

11:00.500 --> 11:02.667
-Yes.
-Now tell me what happens next.

11:02.734 --> 11:03.700
Now he's at the gate.

11:03.767 --> 11:06.500
He's at the gate,
I'm still pointing to leave,

11:06.567 --> 11:08.467
-I'm still giving him a chance.
-Just a second. How--

11:08.533 --> 11:11.533
Just a second.
How far were you from him

11:11.600 --> 11:13.066
when you were pointing to him?

11:13.133 --> 11:15.166
We're damn near
next to each other.

11:15.233 --> 11:18.266
Well, but you were 10 feet away
when he started to back up.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.467
No, he was 10 feet,
we were 10 feet into my yard.

11:20.533 --> 11:21.633
-Into your yard?
-Into my yard.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.700
Just a second,
you're 10 feet into your yard?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.900
[Danny] Yes. Yes.

11:25.967 --> 11:28.834
And he starts to back up,
because he sees your wife

11:28.900 --> 11:30.900
pick up a brick, because
he's punched you.

11:30.967 --> 11:35.133
He, according to you,
was backed up, so now he's 10 feet in.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.200
Mm-hm.

11:36.266 --> 11:39.667
He moves back the 10 feet,
'cause he's in between the gate,

11:39.734 --> 11:42.233
so you are following him,
telling him to leave?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.300
[Danny] Yeah.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.300
Is that what you're telling me,
and you're two feet away?

11:45.367 --> 11:47.533
Yeah, yes,
he's still in my yard,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.934
-he's still in the driveway.
-[Judy] Just a second-- [laughs]

11:50.000 --> 11:51.867
And so yes,
we followed him, because--

11:51.934 --> 11:55.867
But he's moving backwards
to get away from your wife

11:55.934 --> 11:58.233
and the brick and he was
10 feet away from you?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.734
Yeah.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.266
-[Judy] So why were you following him?
-He was refusing to leave.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.900
He was walking backwards to
the gate, he was 10 feet away,

12:04.967 --> 12:05.967
-that's what you said.
-No.

12:06.033 --> 12:08.667
He was only walking backwards
when he noticed my wife.

12:08.734 --> 12:10.734
-Just a second, that's exactly correct.
-Because of the brick.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.734
Why were you close to him?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.333
Why didn't you just stay
back there with your fiancée?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.800
Because we were in fear
that he was gonna come back in.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.967
Oh, that's ridiculous, alright,
I'm getting your picture.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.000
So what happened next?

12:23.066 --> 12:25.600
So now you're--
now you're this close to him again,

12:25.667 --> 12:29.734
because you walk forward
as he's walking backward, and?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.467
He's saying, "Come at me, bro."

12:31.533 --> 12:33.533
He's telling me, when we're
at the gate, he's telling me,

12:33.600 --> 12:35.066
"Come at me, bro, come at me."

12:35.133 --> 12:38.300
-She had a brick in her hand.
-And, shh, what's next?

12:38.367 --> 12:40.467
So I start defending myself,
I start--

12:40.533 --> 12:42.867
-So you, let me understand this.
-[Danny] Yeah. Yes.

12:42.934 --> 12:47.100
He's punched you,
you shoved him, one hand once,

12:47.166 --> 12:49.166
and then shoved him
with both hands.

12:49.233 --> 12:53.467
He's backing up after your
fiancée picks up a brick.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.600
You follow him to the gate,
because he's backing up,

12:56.667 --> 13:00.233
and he says to you,
"Come at me, bro, come at me, bro."

13:00.300 --> 13:02.300
-Mm-hm.
-So then you punched him?

13:02.367 --> 13:03.333
No, I didn't punch him at all.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.467
Well, you said, "I'm defending myself."
What does that mean?

13:05.533 --> 13:07.734
It just means that I have my
hands up ready for him to,

13:07.800 --> 13:10.300
if he strikes at me,
I'm ready to defend myself.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.800
Well, no, you didn't
use the words,

13:11.867 --> 13:15.033
I'm ready to defend myself,
you said, "I defended myself."

13:15.100 --> 13:18.133
-Yeah, I defended myself.
-That's what you said.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.934
-So, is that what he said?
-That's what he said.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.333
Yeah, so my question to you is--
It's not easy.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.033
What do you mean,
you defended yourself?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.934
There's no question
he was injured.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.500
There's no question
you were injured.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.533
So I want to know what you mean

13:31.600 --> 13:33.166
when you say,
"I defended myself."

13:33.233 --> 13:36.300
I'm gonna give him the same
grilling, not to worry.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.367
Why didn't you just go back
in and close the gate?

13:38.433 --> 13:39.900
Because he's refusing to leave.

13:39.967 --> 13:40.967
He was leaving.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.767
No, leaving is when you
have your back turned

13:42.834 --> 13:43.800
and you're walking
towards your car.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.000
-She had a brick in her hand.
-Would I turn my back

13:45.066 --> 13:46.667
towards somebody with a brick?

13:46.734 --> 13:48.500
-No, Your Honor.
-[Judy laughing]

13:51.600 --> 13:55.066
[theme music]

13:57.700 --> 13:59.767
[narrator] <i>Danny</i>
<i>Martinez and his fiancée,</i>

13:59.834 --> 14:02.800
<i>Alexandra Sanchez-Mar</i>
<i>claim Brandon Alvarez</i>

14:02.867 --> 14:06.700
<i>assaulted Danny after he</i>

14:06.767 --> 14:09.133
<i>Brandon is countersuing</i>
<i>for sound equipment</i>

14:09.200 --> 14:11.433
<i>and claims he was</i>
<i>the one assaulted.</i>

14:11.500 --> 14:13.266
Now you're at the gate,

14:13.333 --> 14:15.033
we're going at this
frame by frame.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.433
Yeah, he says, "Come at me."

14:16.500 --> 14:17.900
-"Come at me."
-Yeah.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.633
-And you do?
-Yeah.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.033
'Cause you're
walking towards him?

14:21.100 --> 14:22.100
Yeah.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.600
[Judy] And what happens
when you get to him?

14:23.667 --> 14:25.767
-Um...
-"Um" is not an answer.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.333
I noticed my wife right
next to me with the brick.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.266
So she's-- you know, she's still
with me in the driveway.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.800
We're leading
towards the sidewalk,

14:32.867 --> 14:34.333
'cause he's just backing up.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.066
Just-- Just a second. He's backing up,
now he's on the sidewalk?

14:38.133 --> 14:39.867
-He's leaving towards the sidewalk.
-He's--

14:39.934 --> 14:42.233
-Where, in the driveway?
-Yes.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.467
-He's in the driveway?
-He's still in the driveway.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.500
The driveway is beyond the gate

14:47.567 --> 14:49.300
or it's still inside the gate?

14:49.367 --> 14:50.600
It's beyond the gate.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.867
So he backed out beyond the gate?

14:52.934 --> 14:55.433
-[Danny] Yes.
-So now he's beyond the gate,

14:55.500 --> 14:57.633
the gate that he opened
to come into your yard?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.133
-Mm-hm.
-"Uh-huh" is not an answer.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.200
Yes, Your Honor.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.400
Okay, and you and
fiancée with the brick

15:03.467 --> 15:06.734
are following him and
he's now in the driveway?

15:06.800 --> 15:07.800
[Danny] Yes.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.467
-And you're in the driveway?
-Yes.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.567
Well, why didn't you just go back
in and close the gate?

15:11.633 --> 15:13.266
Because he's refusing to leave.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.066
Just a second, he was leaving.

15:15.133 --> 15:16.700
No, leaving is when you
have your back turned

15:16.767 --> 15:17.967
and you're walking
towards your car.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.166
-You have a brick in your hand.
-Would I turn my back

15:19.233 --> 15:21.233
towards somebody with a brick?

15:21.300 --> 15:22.834
-No, Your Honor.
-[laughs]

15:22.900 --> 15:24.800
-No, Your Honor.
-Alright. Let me hear about--

15:24.867 --> 15:26.033
Let me hear about the fight.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.734
So far you shoved him,
he punched you

15:28.800 --> 15:30.867
and she picked up a
dangerous instrument,

15:30.934 --> 15:32.800
-so that's so far?
-Yes.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.800
Okay, what happened next?

15:34.867 --> 15:37.033
So we lead towards the end
of the driveway,

15:37.100 --> 15:40.600
I put my hands on my wife,
letting her know that it's okay.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.800
[Judy] Fiancée?

15:41.867 --> 15:45.767
My fiancée, I put her my hands on her
letting her know that it's okay,

15:45.834 --> 15:47.700
he's already at the
sidewalk at this point.

15:47.767 --> 15:51.400
But instead he strikes
me again in my face

15:51.467 --> 15:53.166
and at this point
I'm like, "Okay,

15:53.233 --> 15:54.433
this guy, he's not leaving,"

15:54.500 --> 15:58.000
so I grab the brick from
my wife and I toss it at him.

15:58.066 --> 16:02.333
I miss. At this point, he
tackles me towards my car

16:02.400 --> 16:05.533
and I'm trying to hold him down,
we ended up on the ground

16:05.600 --> 16:08.533
and he, you know,
somehow overpowers me

16:08.600 --> 16:10.800
and slams my face to the cement

16:10.867 --> 16:13.467
and when we're getting up,
he knees me in my collarbone.

16:13.533 --> 16:14.567
Your version?

16:14.633 --> 16:16.667
Your Honor, I don't
have no reason to lie.

16:16.734 --> 16:21.000
Just a second.
Everybody has a reason to lie.

16:21.066 --> 16:23.066
Whether you lie or not
is something

16:23.133 --> 16:25.667
that I unfortunately am
gonna have to determine.

16:25.734 --> 16:31.266
May 15th, 2021,
one o'clock, who was driving?

16:31.633 --> 16:32.700
My cousin was driving.

16:32.767 --> 16:35.467
Had you tried to call
Mr. Martinez before?

16:35.533 --> 16:38.433
I don't have his number.
I can't get a hold of him that way.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.033
My only form of communication
with him was through Instagram

16:41.100 --> 16:42.667
and he blocked me
when he read my message.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.800
Okay, on what date
did he block you?

16:44.867 --> 16:46.967
May 5th, the same day
that I messaged him.

16:47.033 --> 16:48.867
-Do you have that message?
-That's correct, I do.

16:48.934 --> 16:50.066
[Judy] I'd like to see it.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.266
Okay, I'm looking for this
date, that's Wednesday.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.266
May 5th, 2021.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.333
May 5th, okay, and this
happened 10 days later?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.367
-Correct.
-And you said, "What's up, G,

17:12.433 --> 17:14.300
I'll stop by your house
tomorrow around 2:00

17:14.367 --> 17:17.333
-to pick up my mic. So you know."
-Correct.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.900
[Judy] Did you get
a response from him?

17:18.967 --> 17:20.033
No response at all.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.533
And you didn't go
over the next day?

17:21.600 --> 17:24.266
No, well, I passed by
and his car wasn't there

17:24.333 --> 17:25.533
at that time. I knew
that he wasn't home,

17:25.600 --> 17:27.100
so I didn't bother to
get off or anything.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.667
Okay, and did you at some point

17:29.734 --> 17:31.433
block him from
communicating with you?

17:31.500 --> 17:32.967
-At some point, I did.
-Just a second.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.433
At what point on what day?

17:34.500 --> 17:35.667
May 8th.

17:35.734 --> 17:37.934
[Judy] And tell me why you
blocked him on May 8th.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.767
I was texting and calling Steve,

17:41.834 --> 17:44.734
Steve had let me know that
he was gonna reach out to him.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.100
I had let Steve know,
keep me out of this.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.600
[Judy] Well, you hadn't
had a fight with him?

17:49.667 --> 17:50.633
No.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.567
So why wouldn't you just
give him back his mic?

17:52.633 --> 17:54.867
What were you dealing
with Steve for?

17:54.934 --> 17:55.900
I was dealing with Steve,

17:55.967 --> 17:57.834
because I asked him
for some advice.

17:57.900 --> 17:58.934
Steve was already
letting me know that--

17:59.000 --> 18:00.100
Just a second.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.700
-But this is what I don't understand.
-Yeah.

18:02.767 --> 18:07.233
Clearly Steve knew
that it was his mic.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.266
Yes.

18:08.333 --> 18:11.233
Because he gave it back
to him at some point,

18:11.300 --> 18:13.000
so he knew that it was his mic.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.900
-You knew that it was his mic.
-Yes.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.266
So why didn't you just--

18:16.333 --> 18:18.600
And you hadn't had an argument
with him, Mr. Martinez?

18:18.667 --> 18:20.033
[Danny] Yes.

18:20.100 --> 18:25.166
So I'm not figuring out why
you asked Steve for advice,

18:25.233 --> 18:28.166
instead of just on May 5th,
saying, "You know what,

18:28.233 --> 18:30.033
we're not gonna be
home on May 5th,

18:30.100 --> 18:32.567
I'll leave your
mic on the porch,

18:32.633 --> 18:34.033
I'll leave it in the backyard."

18:34.100 --> 18:35.867
There's a piece
missing here for me.

18:35.934 --> 18:40.166
Yeah, it's 'cause Steve was
telling me to ignore him.

18:40.233 --> 18:42.400
-He was telling me--
-Oh, well, wait just a second.

18:42.467 --> 18:44.767
Steve was telling
you to ignore him?

18:44.834 --> 18:45.767
[Danny] Yes.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.600
I'm just curious as to why
you would listen to that?

18:49.667 --> 18:51.266
Because I trusted Steve, I trusted him

18:51.333 --> 18:53.300
-and that's where I made a mistake.
-Just-- Just--

18:53.367 --> 18:55.333
-[Judy] Well, then, it's your mistake.
-Yeah.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.567
Because I'm not hearing anything
that would suggest

18:57.633 --> 18:59.800
that what he was asking
for was unreasonable.

18:59.867 --> 19:02.734
He left a piece of valuable
equipment at your house,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.533
you knew it belonged to him, he said,

19:04.600 --> 19:07.266
"I'll come by and pick it up,"
nothing bad about it.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.800
You don't respond to him,
you block him from your Instagram.

19:10.867 --> 19:14.900
I mean, the smart thing to do,
Mr. Alvarez,

19:14.967 --> 19:16.834
-is to take him to court.
-Correct, Your Honor.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.100
You know, that's the
smart thing to do.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.700
To go over to his house is
not the smart thing to do,

19:20.767 --> 19:24.600
'cause you know he's
acted like a dummy

19:24.667 --> 19:26.867
by blocking you from Instagram.

19:26.934 --> 19:28.367
Your Honor,
I didn't think there was any,

19:28.433 --> 19:30.700
I mean, there was,
like I said, me and him,

19:30.767 --> 19:32.734
I've met his wife before,
I've met his children,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.500
I mean, there was never any--

19:34.567 --> 19:36.166
Any bad, yeah, he was acting--

19:36.233 --> 19:38.266
Never any bad,
I didn't think anything of it.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.600
I was just trying
to pick up my equipment,

19:39.667 --> 19:41.500
and it was my equipment,
he knew it was my equipment,

19:41.567 --> 19:43.800
he even suggested for me
to buy that equipment.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.066
Just a sec, I get it,

19:45.133 --> 19:47.667
so now I want you to
tell me what happened,

19:47.734 --> 19:51.700
'cause I'm not understanding
this whole business here.

19:51.767 --> 19:55.667
By the way, a brick is
a dangerous instrument

19:56.133 --> 19:58.467
and if you followed him
out into a public street

19:58.533 --> 20:01.100
with a dangerous instrument,
that's a no-no,

20:01.166 --> 20:02.700
-do you understand?
-Yes, ma'am.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.667
It's not a dangerous instrument

20:04.734 --> 20:06.066
if you build a building with it,

20:06.133 --> 20:09.767
but if you threaten somebody
or if you throw it at them,

20:09.834 --> 20:11.967
it's a dangerous instrument,
do you understand?

20:12.033 --> 20:13.000
Yes.

20:13.066 --> 20:15.967
Now I want you to tell me
your version of what he,

20:16.033 --> 20:18.834
so you went there,
he had blocked you from Instagram,

20:18.900 --> 20:22.900
so that you know that
for some ungodly reason,

20:22.967 --> 20:25.433
he's blocked you,
he's cut you off,

20:25.500 --> 20:27.266
you never had any
problem with him before.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.567
So you go to his house
with a driver.

20:29.633 --> 20:30.667
Correct.

20:30.734 --> 20:33.300
One o'clock in the
afternoon unannounced.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.467
That's correct, Your Honor.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.100
And you go into the backyard?

20:36.166 --> 20:37.767
Well, no, first I'm walking,
right, like he said,

20:37.834 --> 20:39.200
I'm walking to the side gate

20:39.266 --> 20:40.333
and his parents live separately,

20:40.400 --> 20:41.834
they live on one
side of the house

20:41.900 --> 20:43.567
and he lives on the other
side of the house, right?

20:43.633 --> 20:45.300
You have to get in
through the gate to knock,

20:45.367 --> 20:46.633
but as I'm walking, I smell weed,

20:46.700 --> 20:48.567
because they were both smoking outside

20:48.633 --> 20:51.066
and his son wasn't outside
like he says,

20:51.133 --> 20:52.500
so it's just a little strange to me.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.433
Okay, so you smelled marijuana?

20:54.500 --> 20:55.600
[Brandon] Yes, I smell marijuana.

20:55.667 --> 20:56.967
-From the back?
-Yes.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.700
Well, from his front of the yard,

20:58.767 --> 21:01.467
-it's his front of the yard.
-Okay. Okay, keep going.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.300
Like I said, I'm walking
to the front gate.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.266
I told him, "Hey, what's up?
Where's my mic at?

21:05.333 --> 21:07.900
You blocked me on Instagram.
What's that all about?"

21:07.967 --> 21:11.467
And I'm stepping inside,
I'm not 10 feet inside.

21:11.533 --> 21:12.800
-Just tell, don't--
-Okay.

21:12.867 --> 21:13.900
You're stepping inside the gate?

21:13.967 --> 21:18.333
I'm stepping inside and as
soon as I step into his gate,

21:18.400 --> 21:20.467
still open, he approached me
with one hand

21:20.533 --> 21:22.367
and he grabbed my neck,
he doesn't shove me,

21:22.433 --> 21:24.767
he grabbed my neck and I have, if I may,

21:24.834 --> 21:26.834
I have evidence here, where it showed

21:26.900 --> 21:29.100
that he clearly grabbed
my neck, not shoving me.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.367
I mean, you're not gonna
have any mark from shoving.

21:30.433 --> 21:33.166
May I see?
Can I see what he's got?

21:38.567 --> 21:40.233
There's a timestamp
on there as well.

21:42.633 --> 21:43.934
[Judy] Who took this photograph?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.033
[Brandon] I did myself.

21:48.133 --> 21:49.200
[Judy] Go ahead.

21:49.266 --> 21:53.000
As I said, he grabbed my neck
and so like anyone would,

21:53.066 --> 21:55.667
I reacted and I punched him,
so he would let go of me.

21:55.734 --> 21:59.066
I was not 10 feet inside, I was--
my back was towards the gate

21:59.133 --> 22:01.033
and as I reacted
and I punched him--

22:01.100 --> 22:02.700
-What was being said?
-What was said?

22:02.967 --> 22:04.900
He was telling me to
"Get the... out of here,"

22:04.967 --> 22:07.066
excuse my language, he said,
"Get the... outta here.

22:07.133 --> 22:08.867
I don't have your equipment,"
and I was just telling him,

22:08.934 --> 22:11.066
"You have my equipment, and
I haven't gotten my equipment back.

22:11.133 --> 22:14.100
And at this point, him and his
wife both picked up a brick,

22:14.166 --> 22:15.800
not just his wife,
he picks it up as well

22:15.867 --> 22:17.700
and that's why he
said I was walking

22:17.767 --> 22:20.834
with my back towards the street,
I didn't wanna turn around,

22:20.900 --> 22:22.367
I was in fear that I was
gonna get hit with a brick

22:22.433 --> 22:24.900
by both of them and so as
I'm walking out the gate,

22:24.967 --> 22:27.934
I close the gate and
he still opens the gate

22:28.000 --> 22:30.133
and he follows me and this
is when he approaches me

22:30.200 --> 22:31.600
and he tried to hit me with a brick,

22:31.667 --> 22:32.934
he swings on me with a brick

22:33.000 --> 22:34.767
and I reacted
and I hit him again.

22:34.834 --> 22:37.734
This time he falls to the floor,
picks up the brick again

22:37.800 --> 22:39.066
and I'm still walking,
like he says,

22:39.133 --> 22:40.533
I'm already towards the sidewalk.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.367
You know, I'm trying to leave,
but he throws it at me

22:43.433 --> 22:45.433
and he comes and he
tackled me to the floor

22:45.500 --> 22:47.633
and that's how you've seen
the pictures I have,

22:47.700 --> 22:51.533
the abrasions and the marks
on my side and like he said,

22:51.600 --> 22:52.967
he was trying to hold
me down on the floor

22:53.033 --> 22:54.767
and I picked him up and
I threw him off of me.

22:54.834 --> 22:58.400
I didn't knee him, I'm still
trying to get away from him,

22:58.467 --> 22:59.734
-because they both have--
-Did the person

22:59.800 --> 23:02.000
who was in the car
get out of the car?

23:02.066 --> 23:03.767
No, they never got out
at any point.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.433
You have a lot of paperwork.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.867
[Danny] Yeah, Your Honor, a video.

23:06.934 --> 23:08.533
-I'd like to see it.
-Okay.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.100
I have multiple angles.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.667
So this is the angle where he--

23:11.734 --> 23:14.300
-Just a second, I couldn't see it.
-[Danny] Okay.

23:14.367 --> 23:15.633
Could we see the video please?

23:15.700 --> 23:16.633
[theme music]

23:16.700 --> 23:19.100
Steve was supposed to reach out to him.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.567
So if he reached out to him-

23:20.633 --> 23:22.734
I don't answer questions,
I'm telling you.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.900
-Yeah.
-It's irrelevant,

23:23.967 --> 23:25.734
-unless you have some evidence.
-I wanted--

23:25.800 --> 23:26.900
-Yes, I have evidence that--
-No, no.

23:26.967 --> 23:27.934
-[banging on bench]
-I wanted to.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.100
Listen!

23:32.433 --> 23:35.767
[theme music]

23:38.834 --> 23:41.066
[narrator] <i>Danny Martinez</i>
<i>and his fiancée</i>

23:41.133 --> 23:45.033
<i>Alexandra Sanchez-Mar are</i>
<i>accusing Brandon Alvarez</i>

23:45.100 --> 23:47.300
<i>of trespassing and assault.</i>

23:47.367 --> 23:49.033
Okay, could we see the video please?

24:15.934 --> 24:17.000
[Brandon] <i>See right there.</i>

24:28.900 --> 24:30.700
[Judy] <i>Well, I see you</i>
<i>both picked up bricks.</i>

24:30.767 --> 24:32.400
-[Danny] <i>No, I don't have a brick.</i>
-[Judy] <i>Yeah.</i>

24:32.467 --> 24:33.834
[Danny] <i>I just dropped</i>
<i>my phone on the ground.</i>

24:33.900 --> 24:35.233
<i>-I'm pointing at him right now.</i>
-[Brandon] <i>He dropped the brick.</i>

24:35.300 --> 24:36.533
<i>He had the brick in his right hand.</i>

24:36.600 --> 24:38.633
[Danny] <i>Right here, you'll see</i>
<i>I don't have a brick.</i>

24:38.700 --> 24:40.900
<i>I'm right-- He's saying, "Come at me."</i>
<i>I don't have a brick in my hand.</i>

24:40.967 --> 24:43.300
<i>There's no brick in my hand,</i>
<i>it's just my wife.</i>

24:47.467 --> 24:49.200
<i>He strikes at me here.</i>

24:49.734 --> 24:52.300
<i>This is when I got fed up.</i>

24:52.367 --> 24:53.533
[Judy] <i>Why are you...</i>

24:54.667 --> 24:55.600
What?

24:55.667 --> 24:57.567
I don't understand, sir,

24:57.633 --> 24:59.667
why you followed him
out into the street.

24:59.734 --> 25:01.500
'Cause he's saying,
"Come at me."

25:01.567 --> 25:04.266
He's saying he's
not gonna leave.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.333
-He's leaving.
-No, he's not.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.834
So when you went on
the side of the gate,

25:08.900 --> 25:10.967
<i>you can clearly see me</i>
<i>telling him to leave,</i>

25:11.033 --> 25:14.400
<i>I'm still pointing to leave,</i>
<i>he swipes my hand down,</i>

25:14.467 --> 25:17.133
<i>he's knocking my hand down</i>
<i>saying, "No."</i>

25:17.200 --> 25:20.633
I would not come at somebody,
who's already gonna leave.

25:20.700 --> 25:21.734
I'm only gonna come after
somebody that trespass.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.567
Just a second. Don't tell me
what you're gonna do.

25:23.633 --> 25:25.600
-[Danny] Yeah, okay.
-And if you tell me that you think

25:25.667 --> 25:27.533
-that you acted appropriately--
-Yes.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.066
You may have taken
bad advice from Steve

25:30.133 --> 25:32.767
and that may have
been your problem,

25:32.834 --> 25:34.734
and maybe smoking a little weed

25:34.800 --> 25:38.166
and taking bad advice from
Steve all got it together.

25:38.233 --> 25:42.200
But this wasn't a little shove,
that you gave him

25:42.266 --> 25:44.600
and he wasn't somebody
who had done anything to you,

25:44.667 --> 25:47.900
except that you took some
bad advice from Steve.

25:47.967 --> 25:49.467
Your Honor, he trespassed.

25:49.533 --> 25:53.033
He was told to leave multiple
times by my wife as well.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.834
You don't have a wife.

25:54.900 --> 25:57.734
All you had to do was give
him back his equipment.

25:57.800 --> 25:58.800
No, Your Honor.

25:58.867 --> 26:01.934
I'm not excusing coming
to your house unannounced.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.934
What I'm saying is
that you were high,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.967
you had taken bad advice,
you took his property

26:07.033 --> 26:08.400
and gave it to a third person.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.667
He came to get his property,

26:09.734 --> 26:12.667
which he probably shouldn't
have done unannounced,

26:12.734 --> 26:14.166
'cause he knew that
there would be trouble,

26:14.233 --> 26:17.600
but you don't see any
complicity on your part?

26:17.667 --> 26:20.467
Yes, I understand
that I messed up on--

26:20.533 --> 26:22.100
-On a lot of things.
-On ignoring his message.

26:22.166 --> 26:23.867
On a lot of things,
on a lot of things,

26:23.934 --> 26:24.934
-you put your hands--
-But I have proof.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.967
-I have proof here.
-I'd like to see that.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.600
[Danny] That... was
gonna reach out to him.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.700
-[Judy] That who?
-Steve.

26:31.066 --> 26:32.600
Let me explain something to you.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.700
The fact that Steve was
going to reach out to him

26:35.767 --> 26:37.767
is not relevant to this case.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.700
He wouldn't have
come to your house

26:39.767 --> 26:43.700
if Steve had reached out to him
before the 15th of May.

26:43.767 --> 26:46.400
-Correct.
-He wouldn't have. That's your fault.

26:46.467 --> 26:48.867
He reached out to you on May 5th.

26:48.934 --> 26:52.233
From May 5th to May 15th, in my head,
I thought Steve already reached out.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.300
I don't care what's going on
in your head, sir.

26:55.367 --> 26:59.567
Clearly when he came to
your house, at that point,

26:59.633 --> 27:01.967
you knew that he hadn't
gotten his stuff back

27:02.033 --> 27:04.533
and instead of saying to him,
"Listen, I don't have it.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.767
I gave it to Steve,
I'm sorry, I gave it to Steve,"

27:07.834 --> 27:09.433
you shoved him out of your yard.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.266
He doesn't think that
there's anything wrong

27:11.333 --> 27:13.033
in being in your yard, sir.

27:13.100 --> 27:16.333
It's not as if you had had
bad words with him before,

27:16.400 --> 27:19.667
the only word you had with
him was on the 5th of May,

27:19.734 --> 27:21.333
when he said,
"I'm coming to pick up my mic,"

27:21.400 --> 27:22.867
and you weren't home,

27:22.934 --> 27:24.834
and then you blocked him from Instagram.

27:24.900 --> 27:28.667
You had not had a bad word with him,
he was in your house,

27:28.734 --> 27:33.133
as far as I can tell,
with Steve, playing music

27:33.200 --> 27:36.200
with a mic that he brought to your house
and some of your equipment,

27:36.266 --> 27:40.166
and whether Steve was
supposed to reach out to him,

27:40.233 --> 27:44.133
that is totally irrelevant,
it didn't happen.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.333
And that's why--

27:45.400 --> 27:47.166
[Judy] That's not-- If that's
the proof that you have.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.533
-Yes.
-Well, that's not relevant to this case,

27:49.600 --> 27:51.367
that Steve was supposed
to reach out to him,

27:51.433 --> 27:52.400
that's not relevant.

27:52.467 --> 27:53.900
So if he reached
out to him prior?

27:53.967 --> 27:55.967
I don't answer questions,
I'm telling you.

27:56.033 --> 27:57.367
-Yeah.
-It's irrelevant,

27:57.433 --> 27:59.100
unless you have some evidence.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.333
-Yes, I have evidence that--
-No, no.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.300
-[banging on bench]
-I wanted to.

28:02.367 --> 28:03.734
-Listen!
-Yeah.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.400
Unless you have evidence
that prior to May 15th,

28:08.467 --> 28:14.266
evidence that Steve
returned his mic to him.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.834
-I have--
-No.

28:16.700 --> 28:23.033
Unless you have evidence
that Steve returned his mic to him.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.400
I have evidence that Steve
picked up the microphone.

28:26.467 --> 28:28.100
-From your house?
-From my house.

28:28.166 --> 28:31.166
I know that.
I said that 20 minutes ago.

28:31.233 --> 28:35.166
He and Steve had a falling-out,
you remained friendly with Steve.

28:35.233 --> 28:36.867
You knew that he
had a microphone

28:36.934 --> 28:38.166
that he brought to your house.

28:38.233 --> 28:41.533
He messaged you for the
microphone on May 5th.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.967
Instead of responding
to him like a-- like a person,

28:45.033 --> 28:47.967
you call Steve for advice, this genius,

28:48.033 --> 28:51.600
you call him for advice, he says,
"Just ignore him." [laughs]

28:51.667 --> 28:54.967
And you, Mr. Brilliant,
decided to just ignore him

28:55.033 --> 28:57.600
and block him from Instagram.
That's what happened.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.900
-Am I reading this right?
-Yeah.

28:59.967 --> 29:01.333
-Am I reading it right?
-Yeah.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.734
Your case is dismissed.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.667
Now let's get to your counterclaim.

29:04.734 --> 29:07.700
There was an altercation here.
It was a nasty fight.

29:07.767 --> 29:10.800
One person got more injured
than the other perhaps.

29:10.867 --> 29:13.734
You didn't spend any time
in a hospital, did you, sir?

29:13.800 --> 29:16.500
I had spent time
in my house, sick time.

29:16.567 --> 29:18.633
I don't care if you
spent time in your house.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.400
My question was a simple one:

29:20.467 --> 29:22.300
Did you spend any
time in a hospital?

29:22.367 --> 29:24.533
-No.
-Did you, Mr. Alvarez?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.333
-Yes, I did, Your Honor.
-When?

29:26.400 --> 29:27.600
[Brandon] If I may,
I have evidence right here.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.166
I'd like to see it.

29:38.900 --> 29:41.567
Okay, so you said you
had a visit with a doctor

29:41.633 --> 29:43.367
over the Internet, right?

29:43.433 --> 29:44.567
Correct, over the phone.

29:44.633 --> 29:47.300
Over the phone, and you
said you had a backache,

29:47.367 --> 29:49.800
because of a confrontation
that you had and it hurt

29:49.867 --> 29:52.834
and he told you to take
pain pills for muscle pain.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.600
-That was it?
-Mm-hm. That was it.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.834
Right, well, you shouldn't
have gone to his house.

29:56.900 --> 29:58.800
You had a fight,
you both behaved badly.

29:58.867 --> 30:00.233
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.667
-Of course.
-Of course.

30:01.734 --> 30:03.600
You had a fight
because of your stupidity,

30:03.667 --> 30:05.567
not his, yours, yours.

30:05.633 --> 30:06.867
How can you blame me
for his actions--

30:06.934 --> 30:09.066
Just a second.
I don't answer questions.

30:09.133 --> 30:11.000
-I'm making a statement.
-Yeah.

30:11.066 --> 30:15.834
You took advice from Steve
that turned out to be wrong.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.934
As I said before,
your case is dismissed.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.367
So is your counterclaim.
You got your mic back?

30:20.867 --> 30:23.500
I got my mic, I'm missing
another piece that he still has.

30:23.567 --> 30:25.300
-Okay, you got your mic back?
-Correct.

30:25.367 --> 30:26.767
Okay, we're done here, thank you.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.934
-[Kevin] Court is adjourned.
-[theme music]

30:29.000 --> 30:30.867
This man came to
my home thinking

30:30.934 --> 30:33.567
he had every right to think
that I stole his stuff.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.066
I do feel he was trying
to steal my microphone.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.533
He didn't respond to me.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.367
Due to me trusting someone,
this is what happens.

30:39.433 --> 30:40.500
I didn't want to get
hit with a brick,

30:40.567 --> 30:41.734
I mean, no one wants
to get hit with a brick.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.266
No more bringing business
to family locations at all.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.333
It's just time to part ways.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.600
Watching that video
was very interesting,

30:49.667 --> 30:52.100
because you can
see the defendant

30:52.166 --> 30:56.000
clearly trying to back away,
while both plaintiffs

30:56.066 --> 30:59.200
or one of the plaintiffs
has a dangerous instrument

30:59.266 --> 31:01.266
and had they struck him with that,

31:01.333 --> 31:03.967
that could have really
led to some bad charges,

31:04.033 --> 31:07.467
some felony charges for assault
with a dangerous instrument.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.600
Yeah, I think that, you know,

31:09.667 --> 31:12.367
you're allowed to defend
yourself and your property

31:12.433 --> 31:16.867
with the degree of force
that is being used--

31:16.934 --> 31:18.633
-Against you.
-Against you, clearly,

31:18.700 --> 31:20.200
I mean, he knew why he was there.

31:20.266 --> 31:23.300
I didn't see the defendant,

31:23.367 --> 31:26.033
-when he first came in, being aggressive.
-No.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.734
I actually saw in the video
the plaintiff getting up

31:29.800 --> 31:32.000
and being aggressive
and telling him to get out.

31:32.066 --> 31:34.600
Anyway, what could have
been a very tragic situation

31:34.667 --> 31:36.934
just ended with a couple
of lumps and bumps.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.700
-Keep your hands to yourself.
-Keep you--

31:38.767 --> 31:41.200
Right, right, and if
you have to resolve it

31:41.266 --> 31:43.200
and retrieve property
and you're having a problem,

31:43.266 --> 31:44.433
that's what courts are for.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.500
[Sarah] Exactly.
