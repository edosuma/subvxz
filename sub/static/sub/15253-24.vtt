00:00.131 --> 00:00.905
<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>

00:00.930 --> 00:02.530
<i>Here are a few things that</i>
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:02.586 --> 00:04.253
There was an Intersect
before Chuck?

00:04.321 --> 00:05.822
<i>Dad used this program to input</i>

00:05.873 --> 00:07.990
a new identity
into an operative,

00:08.058 --> 00:09.092
<i>but once he went undercover,</i>
<i>something went wrong.</i>

00:09.159 --> 00:10.993
<i>The program took over.</i>

00:11.061 --> 00:13.029
<i>Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?</i>

00:13.097 --> 00:14.697
The CIA created one of
the most murderous men

00:14.765 --> 00:15.932
in the history
of the world.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.433
You know what happens if
they find out we know?

00:17.501 --> 00:18.534
They order a guy
like me to put

00:18.602 --> 00:20.269
a bullet in each
one of our heads.

00:20.337 --> 00:21.587
The Norseman device.

00:21.672 --> 00:24.707
It can kill a sing person
in the middle of a crowd

00:24.775 --> 00:26.676
with 100% accuracy.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.644
God, what is
that noise?

00:30.564 --> 00:31.597
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,

00:31.682 --> 00:33.349
no, no, no, no, no,
help me!

00:40.624 --> 00:42.558
You awake?

00:44.661 --> 00:47.563
Are you thinking
about the wedding?

00:47.631 --> 00:51.534
It's exactly one week away,
one single, solitary week.

00:51.602 --> 00:53.202
Chuck, what if it rains?

00:53.270 --> 00:54.470
That's good luck, right?

00:54.538 --> 00:56.239
Well, what if it doesn't?

00:56.306 --> 00:58.307
Are we freaking out?
We're freaking out.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.076
That's normal, though,
it's normal to freak out

01:00.144 --> 01:02.078
a little bit
a week before a wedding.

01:03.947 --> 01:05.848
Unless...

01:07.818 --> 01:09.752
It's cold feet?

01:11.388 --> 01:14.991
No, no, no, because
I want to marry you.

01:15.058 --> 01:17.460
I really want to
marry you, too.

01:17.528 --> 01:21.197
It's just the church and
exchanging intimate feelings

01:21.265 --> 01:23.232
in front of a crowd.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.102
Wait, what if we did
a dry run?

01:26.170 --> 01:27.837
A dry run?
Yeah,

01:27.905 --> 01:28.838
yeah, a dry run,
you know,

01:28.906 --> 01:30.072
that way we can work out
the kinks--

01:30.140 --> 01:31.741
no people, no cameras.

01:31.808 --> 01:32.742
Practice makes...

01:32.809 --> 01:33.876
Perfect.

01:35.646 --> 01:37.580
We'll be ready
for anything.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.950
The poison is called thorium.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.385
I don't know much

01:42.452 --> 01:44.337
about it other than seeing
it kill a room full of men.

01:44.421 --> 01:45.688
Thorium is a radioactive
metal, not a poison.

01:45.756 --> 01:47.056
Was it liquid or solid?

01:47.123 --> 01:48.057
Liquid, yellowish.

01:48.124 --> 01:49.291
It's linked to her DNA somehow.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.426
Then the thorium's
been synthesized.

01:50.494 --> 01:51.427
Devon,

01:51.478 --> 01:52.895
do you have
any ideas?

01:52.963 --> 01:54.347
Poison guns aren't in
the textbooks. She's burning up.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.098
I need a bath basin stat.

01:58.769 --> 02:00.636
Hypothermia will decrease
the heart rate

02:00.687 --> 02:01.637
and hopefully slow down

02:01.688 --> 02:03.272
any tissue damage.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.640
Chuck, if she's going
to survive the next 24 hours,

02:04.691 --> 02:07.276
we need to know exactly
how this poison works.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.344
And if it's exotic
like you're saying,

02:08.412 --> 02:09.745
we need to find an antidote.

02:11.114 --> 02:13.049
Okay, I told

02:13.116 --> 02:14.483
everybody at the party
that she had food poisoning

02:14.551 --> 02:15.534
and that she's going to be fine.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.655
She's going to be fine, right?

02:24.211 --> 02:27.129
SARAH
Chuck.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.163
Hey.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.132
Hey.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.351
Hey, baby, hi,
I'm right here.

02:35.639 --> 02:38.441
You look worried.

02:39.943 --> 02:42.478
No, you know, it's just,
just wedding stuff.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.782
Don't freak out.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.884
We're ready for it.

02:50.954 --> 02:53.189
Sarah.

02:54.958 --> 02:57.393
Baby, I'm going to fix this.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.899
We're going to get
married and be together

03:03.967 --> 03:05.468
forever.

03:07.804 --> 03:10.406
I love you.

03:18.048 --> 03:20.850
There's only one person
who can get us that antidote,

03:20.917 --> 03:22.918
and it's the man
who made the damn thing.

03:22.986 --> 03:23.919
Hmm.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.588
Volkoff.

03:25.656 --> 03:28.724
Well, Volkoff's in a
super max penitentiary.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.793
It'd take weeks
to get clearance.

03:30.861 --> 03:31.894
Well, then, I guess
we're just going

03:31.962 --> 03:33.596
to have to break in tonight.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:45.575 --> 03:47.760
There.
Mom, we've reached Volkoff's cell.

03:47.844 --> 03:49.645
Copy that, Chuck,
you have precisely two minutes

03:49.713 --> 03:52.415
before the alarm system
comes back up.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.135
Already open.

03:56.219 --> 03:58.254
That's not right.

04:05.195 --> 04:08.264
Casey, where is Volkoff?

04:08.332 --> 04:09.732
He's gone, Agent Bartowski.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.834
Stay where you are.

04:11.902 --> 04:13.569
Chuck, what is going on
in there?

04:13.637 --> 04:15.338
I know that voice.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.439
Casey, you're
going pale.

04:16.505 --> 04:17.973
I go pale, you don't go pale.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.841
Remember when I told you
opening up the Agent X files

04:19.910 --> 04:21.711
would draw out
a remorseless son of a bitch

04:21.778 --> 04:22.945
that would destroy
our whole team

04:22.996 --> 04:24.513
without breaking
a sweat?

04:24.581 --> 04:27.049
This is the guy they hire
to kill that guy.

04:28.051 --> 04:30.252
Agent Bartowski,

04:30.303 --> 04:31.921
Colonel Casey.
Listen, pal,

04:31.988 --> 04:33.689
I don't know who you are
and frankly I don't care.

04:33.757 --> 04:34.957
I need Volkoff
to save Sarah Walker's life.

04:35.008 --> 04:35.958
Now, where is he?

04:36.009 --> 04:38.094
Name's Decker, Clyde Decker,

04:38.161 --> 04:41.630
order on the Agent X program
and I'm informing you of a wash

04:41.698 --> 04:43.466
and Operation Bartowski.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.467
What does that mean?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.168
It means your CIA resources

04:46.236 --> 04:47.636
are revoked.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.305
But Sarah is dying.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.639
I don't care!

04:50.690 --> 04:52.375
Now, stand down or get buried.

04:52.442 --> 04:54.710
No.

04:54.778 --> 04:55.511
No?

04:55.579 --> 04:56.512
Let me explain.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.954
That guy might think he's a
hard-ass, but I'm the Intersect.

05:05.021 --> 05:06.122

Sarah's temperature is down,

05:22.346 --> 05:23.346
What does that mean, El?

05:23.352 --> 05:26.072
Well, there's signs of a total-

She's breathing
on her own,

05:28.130 --> 05:29.581
but she's in and out

05:29.648 --> 05:30.915
How long does she have?

05:30.966 --> 05:34.419
At this rate, I would say
that she has 12 hours.

Decker is transporting Volkoff

05:48.200 --> 05:50.268
No one who's gone in

We need to intercept
Volkoff in transit.

They're on the 10 East

05:54.440 --> 05:56.307
Well, then, we need
something with speed.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.309

06:00.946 --> 06:02.347
you're going against the CIA.

06:02.414 --> 06:05.083
You and Sarah will have
to disappear forever.

06:05.150 --> 06:07.285
You'll never see
your family again.

06:08.721 --> 06:12.257
I'll do anything I need to do

I want the Nighthawk.

10:40.943 --> 10:42.226

10:42.277 --> 10:44.028
That looks very dangerous.

10:44.096 --> 10:45.396

11:14.573 --> 11:17.358
that you and Stephen
developed for the Intersect

11:17.442 --> 11:19.643
was only supposed to
last for a couple months.

11:19.694 --> 11:23.514
What did I do?

11:23.582 --> 11:26.700

for 30 years?

11:28.987 --> 11:31.989

11:43.735 --> 11:44.919

11:51.142 --> 11:52.343
Right, right, The Norseman.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.211
Um, it was developed
alongside the Intersect.

11:54.262 --> 11:56.947
And it was a weapon
of deterrence.

11:57.015 --> 11:58.616
They were going
to collect the DNA

11:58.683 --> 12:00.885
of all the top black marketeers
in the world.

12:00.952 --> 12:02.353
Oh, you could whack 'em
if they got out of line.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.521
That's smart.
Reagan smart.

12:03.588 --> 12:05.656
Yeah. Peace through violence.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.691
Remember, it was the '80s.

12:07.759 --> 12:08.859
Hartley, is there
an antidote?

12:08.927 --> 12:10.394
Iridium 5.

12:10.462 --> 12:12.196
Okay, how-how...
how do we get it?

12:12.264 --> 12:14.632
Oh, it's simple.
I can make that for you.

12:14.699 --> 12:18.702
Great. That's great.
That's fantastic.

12:18.770 --> 12:20.955
We'll talk on the way
to the hospital. Let's go.

12:21.039 --> 12:23.073
Once we secure
the antidote,

12:23.124 --> 12:23.924
we'll discuss our plans for Viv.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.409
Viv?

12:25.477 --> 12:28.379
Yeah, gal named Vivian
fired The Norseman on Sarah.

12:28.446 --> 12:31.131
Which doesn't matter right now.
What does is the antidote.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.417
Charles, who's Vivian?

12:33.485 --> 12:35.386
It's a Winterbottom family name.

12:40.775 --> 12:42.726
She's your daughter.

12:42.794 --> 12:44.862
My daughter?

12:45.964 --> 12:47.197
And she's your enemy?

12:47.265 --> 12:48.532
It's a long story.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.967
Terrible mistakes
were made.

12:50.035 --> 12:52.069
And now we have
to clean them up.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.371
Will you help me save Sarah?

12:55.473 --> 12:58.325
Yeah. Of course I will.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.911
Thank you.

13:10.255 --> 13:12.456
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

13:18.847 --> 13:20.464
Okay.

13:23.602 --> 13:26.003
That's all you...
That's all you got there?

13:26.071 --> 13:28.138
I mean, these are our
wedding vows, after all, so...

13:28.189 --> 13:30.140
I think I covered the bases.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.542
Okay, cool. Yeah, good, good.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.027
You go, then I'll go,

13:33.111 --> 13:35.412
and then we'll have a little
note session afterwards.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.697
Okay. I'm just gonna go...

13:36.781 --> 13:38.816
You-You go, mm-hmm.

13:38.883 --> 13:40.784
"Chuck,

13:40.835 --> 13:42.986
"you're a gift.

13:43.038 --> 13:46.340
"You're a gift I never dreamed
I could want or need,

13:46.424 --> 13:48.192
"and every day,
I will show you

13:48.259 --> 13:49.960
"that you're a gift
that I deserve.

13:50.028 --> 13:53.197
"You make me the best person
I could ever hope to be,

13:53.264 --> 13:55.633
"and I want to spend
and learn and love

13:55.700 --> 13:57.635
the rest of my life with you."

14:01.373 --> 14:03.607
Talky?

14:06.144 --> 14:08.078
Perfect.

14:08.146 --> 14:10.981
So perfect. So perfect.
Oh, my God.

14:12.684 --> 14:14.618
Sarah. Oh, Sarah.

14:14.686 --> 14:16.453
Oh, mine are a tear-down.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.122
This is a page one rewrite.

14:18.189 --> 14:20.190
I scripted a
wardrobe change.

14:20.258 --> 14:22.559
You know, and a pause
for applause.

14:22.627 --> 14:24.161
Chuck, don't freak out.

14:24.229 --> 14:27.931
Whatever they are,
they will be perfect.

14:30.802 --> 14:33.237
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

14:33.304 --> 14:35.806
The Iridium slowed the
spread of the poison,

14:35.874 --> 14:37.274
but her temperature
is creeping back up.

14:37.342 --> 14:38.575
What are we talking about?

14:38.643 --> 14:40.877
I think that you
bought more time,

14:40.929 --> 14:42.946
but she's still deteriorating.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.218
Okay, okay. Okay, what's next?

14:48.269 --> 14:50.604
I don't know.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.106
What do you mean, you don't...?

14:52.190 --> 14:54.358
Come on. Come on, people, think.
Think about this.

14:54.409 --> 14:56.577
If there's an Iridium 5,
there's got to be

14:56.661 --> 14:58.328
an Iridium 6, right?

14:59.564 --> 15:01.165
About four years ago,

15:01.232 --> 15:02.900
Volkoff was working
on a new compound.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.268
Very secret.

15:04.335 --> 15:05.803
File was labeled "Lead Apron."

15:05.870 --> 15:08.172
Which is a way to protect
against radioactive poisoning.

15:08.239 --> 15:10.107
Volkoff must have known that...

15:10.175 --> 15:12.910
No,must
have known that

15:12.977 --> 15:14.244
number five was weak,

15:14.312 --> 15:15.946
and developed the next stage
antidote, Iridium 6.

15:16.014 --> 15:17.281
Volkoff kept the project

15:17.348 --> 15:18.932
close, at his Moscow base.

15:19.017 --> 15:20.718
El, what's
our time frame?

15:20.785 --> 15:21.985
A day,

15:22.053 --> 15:22.986
maybe less.

15:23.054 --> 15:24.354
And we're out
of here ASAP.

15:24.422 --> 15:27.024
I still have friends
in Global Strike Command.

15:27.091 --> 15:29.610
They'll be happy to give us
a free jump to Russia.

15:29.694 --> 15:30.927
They love mixing it up
with the Reds.

15:30.979 --> 15:32.095
Bartowski!

15:33.565 --> 15:35.816
Guns.
You may be the Intersect, boy,

15:35.900 --> 15:37.267
but you can't outrun a bullet.

15:50.281 --> 15:51.465
Chuck!

16:07.575 --> 16:10.109
So, of course, Chuck goes
marching back to these bullies,

16:10.161 --> 16:12.579
and he demands them
to give me back my pants.

16:12.646 --> 16:13.780
Says he's gonna call

16:13.848 --> 16:14.964
the Intergalactic
Firestorm Federation,

16:15.049 --> 16:16.449
which, by the way,
doesn't exist.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.617
There's no such thing.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.785
Chuck just,

16:18.853 --> 16:20.453
you know, made it
up on the spot,

16:20.521 --> 16:22.188
but, uh, he got me
my pants back.

16:22.256 --> 16:23.823
You know, I love those pants.

16:23.891 --> 16:27.193
Anyway, long story

16:27.261 --> 16:29.345
just to say that...

16:29.430 --> 16:31.364
Chuck never gives up.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.235
You know that already.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.676
What are you doing?

16:43.744 --> 16:45.695
Sarah's dying!

16:45.779 --> 16:47.714
I'm aware of that.

16:47.781 --> 16:49.649
You're aware of that?
I can save her. Please.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.950
She's CIA, just like you,
Decker.

16:51.001 --> 16:52.318
Let me go get the antidote.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.653
One last mission.
That's all I'm asking for.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.321
You're fired, Chuck.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.557
As of... right now.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.725
Operation Bartowski is done.

16:58.792 --> 17:00.260
The Buy More is for sale.

17:00.327 --> 17:02.595
Fine. Fine. Fire me.
Just let me go.

17:02.663 --> 17:04.564
Chuck, there is one last thing
I need from you.

17:04.632 --> 17:08.367
Some CIA property.

17:08.435 --> 17:10.703
What is that?

17:10.771 --> 17:13.239
A suppression device.

17:13.307 --> 17:16.442
They say it only hurts... a lot.

17:18.145 --> 17:19.479
What...?

17:20.513 --> 17:22.147
No. No, no, no, no, no!

17:22.199 --> 17:24.517
Don't take the Intersect!
I need it for the antidote.

17:24.568 --> 17:25.952
I need it
to save Sarah!

17:26.020 --> 17:27.353
I know, Chuck. I know.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.454
No!

17:32.026 --> 17:34.077
No!

17:46.140 --> 17:47.607
What do you want, Clyde?

17:47.675 --> 17:51.177
You're going
to convince Agent Bartowski

17:51.245 --> 17:53.546
and his mom that this is over.

17:53.597 --> 17:57.717
No one can know the true origin
of Alexei Volkoff.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.319
Hmm?

17:59.386 --> 18:00.820
Uncuff him.

18:00.888 --> 18:03.056
John,

18:03.123 --> 18:05.658
I don't need to threaten you
to follow an order.

18:05.726 --> 18:06.892
You're a Marine.

18:06.944 --> 18:09.061
Now, you're going
to do this to protect

18:09.113 --> 18:10.763
the greater good.

18:10.831 --> 18:12.565
Your country.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.668
Hmm.

18:15.736 --> 18:17.804
I'm onto you.

18:17.871 --> 18:20.340
You know I'm not gonna
bail out on Walker.

18:20.407 --> 18:22.408
You think I'm just gonna
accept your offer,

18:22.476 --> 18:24.177
try to escape
with Frost and Chuck.

18:24.245 --> 18:25.378
But it's a setup.

18:25.446 --> 18:27.914
And when I make my
move, you kill us all.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.682
In the report, you
make yourself out

18:29.750 --> 18:31.384
to be the good guy, right?

18:31.452 --> 18:33.353
A real hero.

18:35.756 --> 18:37.890
It's all right.

18:37.942 --> 18:41.027
See... John...

18:44.448 --> 18:46.666
...I'm not afraid...
to be the bad guy.

18:47.768 --> 18:49.202
Neither am I.

19:00.381 --> 19:01.965
Hey, Casey, what's up?

19:02.049 --> 19:03.132
We're making our move.

19:03.217 --> 19:05.218
Does the CIA still have
a man on you?

19:05.285 --> 19:07.587
Yes. Yes, they do.

19:07.638 --> 19:08.671
Well, take him out now!

19:08.756 --> 19:09.922
Meet me back at the apartment.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.090
Yes, sir. Okay, all right.

19:12.326 --> 19:13.459
What's going on?

19:13.510 --> 19:15.294
We're getting Chuck
and Hartley out of here.

19:15.346 --> 19:16.929
Your mom and I
are the magnet.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.514
We're gonna stay here
and distract Decker.

19:18.599 --> 19:20.016
You two get out
in the confusion.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.934
It's the only way
you'll make it to Moscow.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.103
But Casey, they took
the Intersect out of me.

19:24.154 --> 19:25.321
Shut up. You're
Chuck Bartowski,

19:25.406 --> 19:27.440
the second best spy
I've ever worked with.

19:27.491 --> 19:28.941
Now you're gonna go
save the best one.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.410
I-I'm sorry.
What am I supposed to do?

19:30.477 --> 19:33.112
You and Chuck need to break
into Volkoff Industries.

19:33.163 --> 19:34.414
There'll be lots of
security there,

19:34.481 --> 19:36.666
so, you'll have to go
as your old self.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.451
Of course, as Volkoff.

19:38.502 --> 19:40.119
Yes, but he's not you.

19:40.187 --> 19:41.954
He's a mean,
dictatorial, conniving...

19:42.006 --> 19:43.289
Manipulative, amoral...

19:43.357 --> 19:45.224
Limey with relatively
good teeth.

19:45.292 --> 19:46.392
Sounds like I was a monster.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.294
You were.

19:48.362 --> 19:50.430
And you didn't tell me this
for a reason?

19:52.266 --> 19:54.434
My daughter.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.869
I made her into me?

19:59.039 --> 20:00.540
I made her into Volkoff.

20:00.607 --> 20:02.275
I'm sorry, Hartley.

20:03.777 --> 20:05.395
Hey, guys, guys,
we have a situation.

20:05.479 --> 20:06.879
All right, we need
to take out this CIA guard

20:06.947 --> 20:08.881
at the end of the hall.

20:08.949 --> 20:10.750
What? Dude, we don't do
that kind of thing.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.285
Wait. Morgan, is he dangerous?

20:12.353 --> 20:14.153
Yes. Yes, very.

20:14.221 --> 20:15.822
Devon, take him out.

20:15.889 --> 20:17.824
Wait. What? No.
I'm standing right here.

20:17.891 --> 20:19.726
Okay, I'm the professional spy.

20:19.793 --> 20:21.394
Devon will go and
distract this guard.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.563
I will be the one
doing the taking out.

20:23.630 --> 20:26.632
Little spy maneuver we
like to call "the magnet."

20:26.700 --> 20:29.268
So, what,
you're gonna punch him out?

20:29.336 --> 20:31.204
Mm. I don't know.
Probably sweep the leg.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.106
Haven't decided.
I like to improvise.

20:35.509 --> 20:37.944
Move. Up.

20:41.882 --> 20:43.483
Chuck?

20:43.550 --> 20:45.268
New identities. Untraceable.

20:45.352 --> 20:47.153
Extremely rare.

20:47.221 --> 20:50.590
I made them years ago
for an occasion just like this.

20:50.657 --> 20:51.657
You have to use
them, Chuck.

20:51.725 --> 20:53.659
You and Sarah need to disappear.

20:53.727 --> 20:55.128
Got it.

20:56.730 --> 20:58.131
Casey, if I never...

20:58.198 --> 21:00.400
You get the antidote,
you get it to Sarah,

21:00.467 --> 21:01.801
then disappear.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.570
You do whatever it takes,
you save her.

21:07.541 --> 21:09.909
Am I ever gonna see you
again, Mom?

21:09.977 --> 21:12.011
Not if everything goes right.

21:12.079 --> 21:14.013
Good-bye, Chuck.

21:14.081 --> 21:15.465
I love you.

21:22.923 --> 21:24.757
Come on, come on.

21:34.434 --> 21:37.003
All right, Morgan,
sweep the leg.

21:37.070 --> 21:40.323
Or karate chop.

21:40.407 --> 21:43.843
Or roundhouse kick.

21:43.911 --> 21:46.762
Or running... Or, uh...

21:46.847 --> 21:48.214
Or, uh...

21:58.692 --> 22:00.576
You are supposed
to be the magnet.

22:00.661 --> 22:02.411
Dude, sweep the leg?

22:02.496 --> 22:03.529
Come on.

22:03.597 --> 22:04.730
In real life,
you just make a fist

22:04.798 --> 22:06.098
and you hit him
as hard as you can.

22:06.166 --> 22:07.116
You got lucky.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.141
So this is it--

22:15.209 --> 22:17.810
Volkoff Industries.

22:17.878 --> 22:22.482
It's, uh... very stark.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.754
Charles, do you think
this suit is a bit much?

22:28.805 --> 22:29.989
T-Too much sheen?

22:30.057 --> 22:32.758
Remember, Hartley, you are
Alexei Volkoff, okay?

22:32.826 --> 22:34.093
Don't think
about the suit.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.162
Just say as little as possible
and we'll be fine.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.830
Think angry thoughts.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.833
Um, actually, my mind
has just gone blank.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.803
I think I've forgotten
the plan again.

22:43.871 --> 22:47.323
Simply approach
the receptionist and tell her

22:47.407 --> 22:48.774
in a very bold
and Volkoffian way,

22:48.842 --> 22:50.009
you are here to see Vivian.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.177
She'll lead us
to your private elevator.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.945
Once inside the elevator,

22:52.996 --> 22:56.616
I'll slip into the air shaft,
go to the lab.

22:56.683 --> 22:58.084
I can't do it.

22:58.151 --> 22:59.652
No, you have to do it.
No,

22:59.720 --> 23:02.855
I'm not this man,
I'm a scientist.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.191
Your plan is not going
to work, Charles.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.325
Listen to me, it will work.

23:06.393 --> 23:08.494
My plans always work, I promise.

23:08.562 --> 23:10.680
But you're not the
spy you used to be

23:10.764 --> 23:13.065
and I'm not the
villain I used to be.

23:13.133 --> 23:14.767
We can't do this.

23:14.835 --> 23:15.768
Damn it, we can.

23:15.836 --> 23:16.802
If we work together, we can.

23:16.870 --> 23:18.804
What is it, what is going on?

23:20.908 --> 23:22.842
What if she's up there?

23:24.011 --> 23:25.945
My daughter.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.147
This is about Vivian?

23:28.215 --> 23:29.415
I don't know her.

23:29.483 --> 23:31.617
W-What do you say
to a daughter

23:31.685 --> 23:33.886
you've never even met?

23:33.954 --> 23:36.422
"I'm so sorry I've
ruined your life"?

23:38.859 --> 23:42.495
No, no.

23:42.563 --> 23:44.597
I'm sorry, I can't see her.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.702
I'm gonna run away now.

23:49.770 --> 23:50.703
No,

23:50.754 --> 23:52.905
Hart-- wait!

24:06.820 --> 24:08.738
Can I help you?

24:21.702 --> 24:26.606
My name is Charles
Car-- Chuck Bartowski,

24:26.673 --> 24:28.674
and I'm here to see
Vivian Volkoff.

24:28.742 --> 24:30.409
And what is this
in regard to?

24:30.477 --> 24:32.645
She wants to kill me.

24:49.857 --> 24:52.425
I don't believe it.

24:52.476 --> 24:54.527
Charles Carmichael.

24:56.097 --> 24:58.198
I'm impressed.

24:58.265 --> 25:00.200
Walking into my
office unarmed--

25:00.267 --> 25:03.303
bold... stupid but bold.

25:04.605 --> 25:06.539
Sarah is still alive.

25:06.607 --> 25:08.274
How can that be?

25:08.342 --> 25:09.609
It doesn't matter.
What matters

25:09.677 --> 25:11.945
is that I need a vial
of the antidote iridium-6.

25:12.012 --> 25:13.313
Your father stored it here
and I need it.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.314
You need it.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.483
Please, I'm pleading with you.

25:16.550 --> 25:18.618
I am here to plead
for Sarah's life.

25:20.521 --> 25:22.455
What's the trick, Chuck?

25:22.523 --> 25:24.557
What's the clever plan
that gets you out of this?

25:24.625 --> 25:28.128
I'm all out of plans.

25:30.731 --> 25:34.100
The woman that I love is dying
and all I can do is hope

25:34.168 --> 25:36.169
that you haven't totally become
this person.

25:43.744 --> 25:45.662
Everything that you have

25:45.746 --> 25:47.864
ever said was done
to manipulate me.

25:47.948 --> 25:49.332
You told me
my father was a monster

25:49.417 --> 25:50.583
and now you tell me
he's someone else,

25:50.651 --> 25:52.886
some sort of hero?

25:52.953 --> 25:56.840
I wouldn't say hero.

25:56.924 --> 25:58.691
Bloody fool,
more like.

26:00.761 --> 26:02.395
I signed on
for a mission

26:02.463 --> 26:03.997
simply 'cause they needed
a scientist,

26:04.064 --> 26:05.698
and then I convinced
his father,

26:05.766 --> 26:07.534
my friend Stephen,

26:07.601 --> 26:12.172
to let me use his computer
program to help me.

26:12.239 --> 26:14.174
How did you
get in here?

26:14.241 --> 26:15.875
Oh, I just asked
to be shown to my office.

26:15.943 --> 26:18.344
Everyone was really nice.

26:18.412 --> 26:21.448
They, they all jumped up
to help me.

26:21.515 --> 26:23.817
I guess I must have been
a harsh boss.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.888
And father.

26:33.727 --> 26:35.662
I'm so sorry.

26:36.764 --> 26:38.698
You're sorry?

26:40.501 --> 26:42.552
You made me
your succession plan.

26:45.306 --> 26:48.374
This was my grandmother's.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.477
Her name
was Vivian.

26:51.545 --> 26:53.513
She rode horses...

26:53.581 --> 26:55.515
and she looked just like you.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.052
Don't you
see, Vivian?

26:59.119 --> 27:01.387
You're a good person and
you come from a good family.

27:01.455 --> 27:02.522
You've fallen
into the wrong world,

27:02.590 --> 27:03.723
the wrong life,
but this isn't you.

27:03.791 --> 27:04.724
You're not
a killer.

27:04.792 --> 27:06.326
I killed Sarah in cold blood.

27:06.393 --> 27:08.261
But you haven't, you haven't
yet, there's still time.

27:08.329 --> 27:11.464
You can give me the antidote
and I can save her.

27:13.234 --> 27:14.450
No.

27:15.336 --> 27:16.503
I have to be
Volkoff now!

27:16.570 --> 27:18.671
I am this building,
I am this company.

27:18.739 --> 27:22.458
I can never leave,
I can never go back.

27:26.847 --> 27:28.114
What if you could?

27:28.182 --> 27:30.550
How?

27:36.557 --> 27:39.192
These are
blank identities.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.426
They're very rare and
they're very clean.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.295
You'd have to give up
Volkoff Industries,

27:42.363 --> 27:44.864
but if you take these,
you can start over

27:44.932 --> 27:47.500
anywhere in the world,
both of you.

27:49.737 --> 27:53.606
But Charles...
h-how are you going to escape?

27:53.674 --> 27:54.991
It doesn't matter, okay?!
The only thing

27:55.075 --> 27:56.609
that matters is saving Sarah
at this point.

28:02.883 --> 28:05.485
Vivian, I don't know you,
but I'd like to.

28:06.554 --> 28:09.923
If you pull that trigger...

28:09.990 --> 28:14.460
you'll lose yourself forever
like I did.

28:16.263 --> 28:18.164
You can still change.

28:31.712 --> 28:34.781
Please, I need
your help.

28:39.286 --> 28:41.788
My brother is cutting it close.

28:44.758 --> 28:46.426
Whole place
is surrounded

28:46.493 --> 28:47.760
by Decker's men.

28:47.828 --> 28:49.879
Chuck's never going
to be able to get in there.

28:49.964 --> 28:51.097
No, he'll have a plan.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.665
Chuck will come up
with something.

28:54.134 --> 28:56.669
What the hell?

28:56.720 --> 28:58.504
Sorry we're
late, Morgan.

28:58.555 --> 28:59.772
Egypt took longer
than we thought.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.341
Not a problem, ladies,
thank you for coming.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.676
I called Sarah's bridesmaids
as soon as their plane landed.

29:03.744 --> 29:04.911
Don't give me

29:04.979 --> 29:06.746
any grief, Casey,
we're here for Sarah.

29:06.814 --> 29:10.016
Glad you're here.

29:10.084 --> 29:12.018
Meet Mary the
mother-in-law.

29:12.086 --> 29:14.887
Hi.

29:14.955 --> 29:16.889
We have a signal.

29:16.957 --> 29:18.291
Repeat that.
What did you say?

29:18.359 --> 29:20.526
Something's approaching by air.

29:44.051 --> 29:45.151
I have the antidote.

29:45.219 --> 29:46.219
Let me in.

29:46.286 --> 29:47.520
Get him out of here.

29:47.588 --> 29:48.855
Hey!

29:49.890 --> 29:51.324
Decker,

29:51.392 --> 29:53.192
let him in!

29:54.895 --> 29:55.962
Thanks for coming, guys.

29:56.030 --> 29:57.196
You're welcome, Chuck.

29:58.615 --> 30:01.467
Hey, let him in, douche.

30:09.376 --> 30:11.744
You're all under arrest.

30:13.747 --> 30:16.282
Kind of disappointed
in you, Bartowski.

30:16.350 --> 30:18.151
You thought you
could get past me

30:18.218 --> 30:20.453
with a few of your spy friends?

30:20.521 --> 30:21.788
You should
have known

30:21.855 --> 30:23.623
I'd bring an army to stop you.

30:24.725 --> 30:26.859
I know the move...

30:26.927 --> 30:28.861
but we have a move of our own.

30:28.929 --> 30:30.530
It's called
the magnet.

30:30.597 --> 30:32.198
See, while you're busy
looking at me

30:32.266 --> 30:34.500
and all of my spy friends,

30:34.568 --> 30:37.670
you're missing something
really, really big,

30:37.738 --> 30:40.273
care of Volkoff Industries.

This is a file

31:42.870 --> 31:45.404

the cover-up,

31:45.472 --> 31:47.573
and your involvement
in all of it.

When we do it for real,
we'll be ready.

32:51.438 --> 32:55.007
I think we left out one
pretty important little detail.

33:04.084 --> 33:06.152
It's not too late.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.855

Right, my vows.

My turn for that.

They just don't cut it.
I'm sorry, Sarah.

33:58.847 --> 34:02.550
How do I express the depth
of my love for you?

34:02.618 --> 34:04.585
Or my dreams for our future?

34:04.653 --> 34:07.255
Or the fact that I will fight
for you every day?

34:07.323 --> 34:08.656
Or that our kids

34:08.724 --> 34:10.425
will be like little superheroes
with little capes

34:10.492 --> 34:13.293
and stuff like that?

34:14.530 --> 34:16.130
Words can't express that.
They don't

34:16.197 --> 34:18.132
do it justice.
They just don't cut it.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.534
So no vows.

34:25.774 --> 34:29.110
I'll just prove it
to you every day

34:29.178 --> 34:31.279
for the rest of our lives.

34:34.016 --> 34:36.918
You can count on me.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.655
Perfect.

34:44.893 --> 34:47.195
Do you, um, Charles Bartowski...

34:47.262 --> 34:49.097
...take this woman

34:49.164 --> 34:50.697
to be your, uh...

34:50.766 --> 34:52.266
...lawfully wedded wife?

34:53.369 --> 34:56.270
I do.

34:56.338 --> 34:58.172
And do you take this man...?

34:58.240 --> 34:59.323
I do.

34:59.408 --> 35:00.441
Okay.

35:00.509 --> 35:02.326
Well, by the power
vested in me

35:02.411 --> 35:04.245
by the Intergalactic
Federation of Planets...

35:05.781 --> 35:07.648
...I now pronounce you
man and wife.

35:09.251 --> 35:11.019
You may kiss the bride.

35:11.086 --> 35:13.488
Come here.

35:39.665 --> 35:41.149
Trust me, Chuck.

35:46.839 --> 35:48.873
<i>You and I-- we're perfect</i>
<i>for each other,</i>

35:48.957 --> 35:51.676
and I want to spend the
rest of my life with you

35:51.760 --> 35:54.429
away from everyone else
and away from the spotlight.

35:56.048 --> 35:57.682
<i>I love you.</i>

35:59.334 --> 36:01.636
<i>I love you, Chuck.</i>

36:01.687 --> 36:04.038
And nothing's ever
gonna change that.

36:04.106 --> 36:06.507
<i>I feel like I should be</i>
<i>James Bond right now.</i>

36:06.575 --> 36:08.943
You know, like the guy
who's standing on this balcony

36:09.010 --> 36:10.611
with you right now
in this moment. I mean, he...

36:10.679 --> 36:12.680
I didn't fall in love
with James Bond.

36:12.748 --> 36:14.682
<i>I fell in love with you.</i>

36:16.902 --> 36:18.453
Welcome to the family.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.821
Love you.

36:21.323 --> 36:24.392
To the airport,
my good man!

36:29.598 --> 36:31.265
Morgan, what happened
to the driver?

36:31.333 --> 36:34.302
Oh, no. I was always
the driver, Chuck.

36:34.369 --> 36:36.370
Having a little trouble
letting go, I suppose.

36:36.438 --> 36:39.574
Just roll up the partition,
would you, buddy?

36:39.641 --> 36:41.642
As you wish.

36:41.710 --> 36:43.761
As you wish!

Mrs. Chuck Bartowski.

36:53.021 --> 36:55.156
Mr. Sarah Walker.

37:02.281 --> 37:04.415
This is Chuck Bartowski,
happily married man.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.833
What do you want, Morgan?

37:05.901 --> 37:07.401
Charles, sorry
we missed the party,

37:07.452 --> 37:10.004
but we did send a little gift
in our place.

37:10.072 --> 37:11.289
Did you get it?

37:11.373 --> 37:12.623
Hartley.

37:12.708 --> 37:15.176
What are you talking about?

37:15.244 --> 37:17.178
Look under your seat.

37:17.245 --> 37:20.464
Just a little something for my
best friend's son and his bride.

37:23.051 --> 37:25.303
Be wise with it, Charles.

37:25.387 --> 37:27.305
Good luck.

37:37.900 --> 37:39.600
What?

37:39.651 --> 37:42.803
Oh, boy.

37:59.288 --> 38:01.472
Hey, guys.

38:01.506 --> 38:02.423
Well, well.

38:02.458 --> 38:04.693
The prodigal son returns.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.075
From my honeymoon.

38:07.219 --> 38:08.587
Go ahead, chump.

38:08.608 --> 38:09.625
Whistle past the graveyard.

38:09.687 --> 38:10.920
The deal went through.

38:11.317 --> 38:12.884
The Buy More's been sold.

38:12.898 --> 38:13.898
Give it a week.

38:13.970 --> 38:14.774
I guarantee we'll
all be jobless.

38:14.871 --> 38:16.639
Leave us alone, please?
Private conversation.

38:20.809 --> 38:24.178
Well, maybe just
give it a little time, fellas.

38:25.280 --> 38:28.032
Get the hell
back to work!

38:28.116 --> 38:29.550
The new owner
might stop by today.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.187
I am working.

38:59.264 --> 39:01.649
Guess it's the dawn
of a new chapter, eh, boy?

39:01.717 --> 39:04.752
I'd watch that boy talk,
redneck.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.153
From General Beckman.

39:06.221 --> 39:08.189
Your personal effects.

39:08.257 --> 39:10.591
Wouldn't want you to be
without your pocket protector.

39:10.659 --> 39:14.895
Yeah, well, I'd rather wear this
than be in business with you.

39:14.963 --> 39:17.265
You really think you've been
fighting evil, hmm?

39:17.332 --> 39:19.267
Doing good?

39:19.334 --> 39:21.335
You're just a pawn.
You always were.

39:21.403 --> 39:24.405
What are you talking about?

39:24.473 --> 39:26.741
You think
it was all a coincidence?

39:26.808 --> 39:28.976
The Intersect,
FULCRUM, the Ring,

39:29.044 --> 39:31.112
Shaw, Agent X?

39:31.179 --> 39:34.115
That's all just part
of the plan, Bartowski.

39:34.182 --> 39:37.018
Pieces on the puzzle board.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.486
See you never, civilian.

39:38.553 --> 39:41.355
Wait, wait, wait. What plan?

39:41.423 --> 39:43.391
Huh? What plan?

39:43.458 --> 39:45.092
My life was changed forever.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.061
My friends were put in danger.

39:47.129 --> 39:48.596
My family...

39:48.664 --> 39:52.933
My father was killed, Decker.

40:00.325 --> 40:02.943
A plan? Sounds more
like a conspiracy.

40:03.011 --> 40:05.212
Question is,

40:05.280 --> 40:06.714
who could control
our lives so well?

40:06.782 --> 40:08.482
I don't know.
We've been racking our brains.

40:08.550 --> 40:09.650
Ah, it doesn't
matter anyway.

40:09.718 --> 40:10.985
It's not our fight.

40:11.053 --> 40:12.953
You forget
the CIA fired our asses.

40:13.021 --> 40:15.423
Okay, well,

40:15.490 --> 40:19.160
what if we went into business
for ourselves?

40:19.227 --> 40:21.629
And how exactly
would we do that?

40:21.697 --> 40:24.198
Well, we have a base,
and the Buy More has proven

40:24.266 --> 40:25.366
to be an excellent cover.

40:25.434 --> 40:26.967
Uh, Mrs. B?

40:27.035 --> 40:29.503
One thing.
The Buy More just sold.

40:29.571 --> 40:31.739
Yeah. We know.

40:31.807 --> 40:34.041
We bought it.

40:35.210 --> 40:36.310
Hartley turned over all

40:36.378 --> 40:37.778
of Volkoff's assets to us.

40:37.846 --> 40:38.863
Wedding present.

40:38.947 --> 40:41.248
877...

40:41.316 --> 40:42.683
million dollars.

40:42.751 --> 40:44.385
Although I like
to refer to it

40:44.453 --> 40:47.221
as a cool billion, just 'cause
it's kind of more fun to say.

40:47.289 --> 40:48.923
Mamacita, that's a lot of money.

40:48.990 --> 40:51.292
And who better to handle
a billion dollars than me?

40:52.494 --> 40:54.428
Us. Us. Us!

40:54.496 --> 40:56.330
Our first purchase
was the Buy More

40:56.398 --> 40:57.548
and everything below it.

40:57.632 --> 40:58.866
Now we have

40:58.934 --> 41:01.202
all of Volkoff's
resources at our disposal.

41:01.269 --> 41:02.770
That's if you guys still want
to take out some bad guys.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.572
Damn right we do.
Damn right we do.

41:04.639 --> 41:05.606
You guys want a job?

41:05.674 --> 41:08.175
Hell, yeah.
Hells, yeah.

41:08.226 --> 41:09.877
Great! I took the liberty
of buying us a Gulf Stream

41:09.945 --> 41:12.113
and all new tactical equipment.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.914
We do have to
reoutfit Castle, though,

41:13.982 --> 41:16.016
so, any ideas?

41:16.068 --> 41:18.402
Wow. Freelance spies.

41:18.487 --> 41:21.856
Yes! Men... and women
of action and adventure.

41:21.923 --> 41:23.824
Under the radar,
above the law.

41:23.875 --> 41:27.211
Oh, man, this is gonna be
so much fun.

41:27.295 --> 41:29.897
Just, uh, huh.

41:31.416 --> 41:33.367
Oh, nice. Slick new gig.

41:33.435 --> 41:35.002
Slick new shades.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.806
What could go wrong?

41:38.873 --> 41:40.541
Oh.

41:53.438 --> 41:56.056
Morgan?
Morgan?!

41:56.124 --> 41:58.058
Morgan?

42:08.036 --> 42:10.738
Morgan, did
you just...?

42:10.806 --> 42:13.607
Guys... I know kung fu.
