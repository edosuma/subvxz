32:56.769 --> 32:57.869
that's important right now.

32:57.937 --> 32:59.370
You think you have
a say in this?

32:59.438 --> 33:01.072
Get them the hell
out of here!

33:01.140 --> 33:03.441
I'm telling you,
I could salvage the operation!

33:03.508 --> 33:05.509
Already been decided.
SRTs are on the way.

33:05.577 --> 33:08.078
They're making a hard entrance
through the south wall.

33:08.146 --> 33:09.780
Only now they don't
have a diversion!

33:09.848 --> 33:12.683
If you breach the south wall,
you will be seen.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.386
He will shoot Fiona!
He will shoot your men!

33:15.453 --> 33:16.854
If you let me handle this--

33:16.922 --> 33:17.922
- you should have
thought about that before

33:17.989 --> 33:19.257
you went off
the reservation.

33:19.324 --> 33:21.493
Listen to me. I have
a plan that will fix this.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.061
I will save Fiona.

33:23.129 --> 33:25.363
And the only one who will die
will be Gamble.

33:37.912 --> 33:40.380
In a hostage situation,
tactical data

33:40.448 --> 33:42.249
is usually
the most important.

33:42.316 --> 33:43.851
Your focus is on details

33:43.919 --> 33:46.387
like the building's entry points
and blind spots,

33:46.454 --> 33:48.622
your target's potential
escape routes,

33:48.690 --> 33:51.291
and your team's
assault capabilities.

33:51.359 --> 33:54.161
But sometimes even more
important than your knowledge

33:54.229 --> 33:56.630
of the situation
is what you know about

33:56.698 --> 33:59.534
the person you are trying
to save.

34:07.342 --> 34:10.911
Why are you so quiet?

34:10.980 --> 34:15.617
I don't like the idea
of people shooting at you.

34:15.685 --> 34:19.822
You're worried.

34:19.889 --> 34:23.693
You're not?

34:23.760 --> 34:28.364
One thing you will learn
about me, Michael McBride,

34:28.431 --> 34:31.000
I don't worry.

34:31.068 --> 34:33.570
Not since
I was a little girl.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.894
[Cell phone rings]

34:58.962 --> 35:00.396
[Phone beeps]

35:00.464 --> 35:02.732
You're cutting it close,
Mr. Axe.

35:02.799 --> 35:04.834
You said one hour.

35:04.902 --> 35:09.772
Who is this?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.841
Michael Westen.

35:11.909 --> 35:14.677
Westen.

35:17.014 --> 35:18.881
They said you
weren't in Miami.

35:18.949 --> 35:20.116
Well, it's your lucky day.

35:20.183 --> 35:22.785
I made a special trip
just for you.

35:28.458 --> 35:31.227
Stop right there, Westen.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.463
Turn around,
take off the vest.

35:33.531 --> 35:35.566
No tricks.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.302
I'm here to give you
what you want...

35:42.474 --> 35:46.078
As long as Fiona
gets out of there unhurt.

35:46.145 --> 35:50.081
Good. We're on
the same page then.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.417
You and your CIA pals
are going to put together

35:52.484 --> 35:54.819
a little get-out-of-town kit
for me.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.254
I want 1 million in cash,
evenly divided in dollars,

35:57.322 --> 35:59.723
renminbi, reals,
and British pounds.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.526
- I can get that but first--
- I'm not finished yet!

36:02.594 --> 36:04.328
I want a blank
Canadian passport,

36:04.396 --> 36:06.730
a Lear 60 fueled up
on the runway at Opa-Lacka,

36:06.798 --> 36:09.567
and a clear flight path
out of Miami.

36:09.634 --> 36:12.503
I'll keep Fiona and you with me
until I am on the plane.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.041
Oh, you can talk now.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.176
Deal.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.544
I'll get you everything
that you want.

36:19.612 --> 36:23.314
But first I talk to Fiona.
Stop wasting time.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.016
I've sent a proof of life
to your friend.

36:25.084 --> 36:27.018
That was an hour ago.
Put her on the phone.

36:27.086 --> 36:30.122
I'm the one giving
the orders here.

36:30.190 --> 36:33.358
No deal.

36:33.426 --> 36:36.228
When I was younger my father
wanted to protect his family

36:36.296 --> 36:38.664
and their beliefs,
no matter what.

36:38.732 --> 36:43.470
I watched him get beaten
and shot at.

36:43.537 --> 36:45.972
But if he was afraid,
he never showed it.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.608
He always said, "there's
a difference between living

36:48.676 --> 36:51.545
and living free."

36:53.547 --> 36:56.683
Stop right there--
stop, God damn it. Stop!

36:59.654 --> 37:02.723
Fine.
You can talk to her.

37:05.994 --> 37:08.963
Of course living with honor,
it only put us in more danger.

37:09.031 --> 37:10.751
My father, he came up
with a plan to warn us

37:10.766 --> 37:12.835
if he knew trouble
was brewing and he'd say,

37:12.902 --> 37:16.305
"Fiona.

37:16.373 --> 37:20.276
Time to be brave,
little angel."

37:20.344 --> 37:23.580
You get ten seconds
of quality time, Westen.

37:23.648 --> 37:26.416
Make it count.

37:26.484 --> 37:27.983
Fi.

37:28.051 --> 37:30.620
I'm here, Michael.

37:30.687 --> 37:33.489
"Time to be brave,
little angel"?

37:33.557 --> 37:35.758
I suppose it was
a code of sorts.

37:35.826 --> 37:37.126
[Clicks]

37:37.194 --> 37:39.428
What it really meant was,
"Get down on the floor,

37:39.496 --> 37:41.930
close your eyes, and start
praying till it's over."

37:41.998 --> 37:44.767
[Clicks]

37:44.835 --> 37:48.871
I'm gonna
get you home.

37:48.939 --> 37:51.940
And Fiona...

37:52.008 --> 37:54.609
[Irish accent] It's time
to be brave, little angel.

37:59.148 --> 38:02.718
[Glass shattering]

38:09.192 --> 38:10.959
[Glass shattering]

38:20.604 --> 38:21.470
[Cocks gun]

38:57.639 --> 38:59.473
[Gunfire stops]

39:09.885 --> 39:11.619
[Sirens wailing]

39:11.687 --> 39:14.522
[Police radio chatter]

39:30.106 --> 39:34.076
There he is,
the man of the hour.

39:34.143 --> 39:37.513
That was one balls-out
crazy move but you made it work.

39:37.581 --> 39:40.015
Now let's go down to the D.R.
and finish this operation.

39:40.083 --> 39:42.151
[Slaps arm]

39:53.094 --> 39:57.731
So you guys tagged my phone,
my watch, and my car.

39:57.799 --> 40:00.634
Anywhere else I should check,
Mike, like my molars?

40:00.702 --> 40:03.003
Elsa's hotel suite.

40:06.107 --> 40:09.443
You're talking
about the penthouse?

40:09.510 --> 40:10.877
Mike, please tell me
that you guys

40:10.945 --> 40:12.845
were not listening
this morning.

40:12.913 --> 40:14.313
- Just sweep it, Sam.
- [Groans]

40:14.381 --> 40:16.782
Oh, my God.

40:16.850 --> 40:18.250
Look, Mike,
next time you're in town

40:18.251 --> 40:20.185
just skip the bugs
and pick up a phone, man,

40:20.253 --> 40:22.054
before we're knee deep
in a suicide mission.

40:22.121 --> 40:24.289
For what it's worth,
I had orders.

40:24.357 --> 40:25.557
Yeah, well
in this situation,

40:25.624 --> 40:28.526
"I had orders"
doesn't really cut it, buddy.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.065
I'm sorry.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.434
Look, we're just glad
that you're okay.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.369
And Mike, we know you can't
tell us the whole story

40:38.437 --> 40:39.870
but we've seen enough
of the board to know

40:39.938 --> 40:41.505
that you're into
something pretty heavy.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.107
So if you need a hand,
let us know.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.135
Yeah, the Lone Ranger routine,
it might feel noble

40:45.176 --> 40:46.743
but it's gonna
get you killed one day.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.613
Actually even the Lone Ranger
had Tonto and the horse.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.849
Right. Tonto. Horse.

40:55.319 --> 40:58.355
Yeah, Mikey, um...

40:58.422 --> 41:01.224
You gonna
talk to Fi?

41:05.129 --> 41:07.397
Come on, Kemosabe.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.137
Thank you.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.445
Hello, Michael.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.881
You okay?

41:23.948 --> 41:25.382
Yeah, it's just
a few stitches.

41:25.450 --> 41:28.084
The glass in the windows,
it would have been worse...

41:32.624 --> 41:36.426
You remembered
my story.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.396
I'll never forget it.

41:45.704 --> 41:48.439
Fi...

41:48.507 --> 41:52.176
[Whispers]
Take care.

41:52.244 --> 41:55.214
- Who's the girl?
- Fiona Glenanne.

41:55.281 --> 41:58.117
Believe me, lad, you won't
be wanting any of that.

42:01.254 --> 42:03.122
Besides, she's taken.

42:08.862 --> 42:12.064
Taken?
You see that?

42:12.132 --> 42:13.932
That's the kiss you give
when it's over.
