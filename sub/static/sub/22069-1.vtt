WEBVTT

01:52.012 --> 01:53.281
Oh, God.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.324
JUDGE: It is the judgment
of this court

02:36.390 --> 02:38.626
that the defendant,
Conrad Harlow,

02:38.692 --> 02:42.029
having been found guilty
of the murder of Emily Byrne,

02:42.095 --> 02:45.833
be committed to the custody
of the US Bureau of Prisons

02:45.899 --> 02:48.669
for a life sentence
without parole.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.919
NEWS ANCHOR:
Still the main suspect
in two additional murders

03:38.986 --> 03:40.788
and five missing persons cases,

03:40.854 --> 03:43.491
the FBI have only been able
to make a case against him

03:43.557 --> 03:46.560
for the murder of
FBI agent Emily Byrne.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.397
The serial killer's
macabre signature,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.399
removing the eyelids
of his victims.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.402
Hey, where is she?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.070
Sir, please.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.772
I want to know where my wife is.

03:58.839 --> 03:59.940
Sir, please.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.074
Where did you put her?

04:01.141 --> 04:02.643
Nick, no!
Where did you put her?

04:02.710 --> 04:06.146
Where is she
Nick!

04:06.213 --> 04:07.748
Where is my wife?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.884
COXSWAIN:
On the starboard, one.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.355
Port side up, two...

04:17.725 --> 04:19.693
Tap it on, tap it on, three...

04:22.262 --> 04:23.997
Breathe! Two.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.034
Breathe! Three.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.472
Stop!

05:00.768 --> 05:01.802
Hey, Tommy.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.444
Cause of death
is manual strangulation.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.547
We're running his DNA
through the usual databases.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.649
Here, look at this.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.085
Fish bites. Note the texture.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.555
Now, look at the eyelids.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.824
These are clean cuts, not bites.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.627
So the eyelids were cut off?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.063
You're sure?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.600
Unless a new species of fish
recently mutated in the Charles,

05:32.666 --> 05:34.735
which I suppose is possible.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.810
What is it?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.014
Conrad Harlow.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.717
Killed that Fed, Emily Byrne,
a while back.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.985
Give you one guess
what his signature was.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.055
You think the wrong man's
in jail?

05:57.458 --> 05:58.859
Or this is a copycat.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.867
You ready?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.502
Not really.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.837
Take your marks, guys.

06:09.903 --> 06:10.904
Come on.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.447
You can do this.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.866
Come on, Flynn!

06:40.634 --> 06:42.169
Keep going!

06:47.708 --> 06:48.576
Yeah!

06:48.642 --> 06:51.111
Hey, how's he doing?
He's doing good.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.714
Come on, buddy!

06:53.781 --> 06:56.484
Come on, keep swimming,
keep moving, come on, Flynn!

06:56.550 --> 06:57.851
Come on. You made it!

06:58.852 --> 06:59.653
I won!

06:59.720 --> 07:01.655
You won, baby, you did it!

07:10.330 --> 07:11.632
Come on, guys.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.366
Come on...

07:13.433 --> 07:15.402
What

07:15.469 --> 07:18.038
Are you embarrassed?
You embarrassed?

07:36.356 --> 07:37.725
Hey, Adam.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.359
Nick, I'm sorry, I was just...

07:39.426 --> 07:40.828
No, no, it's all right.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.899
Come on.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.115
Hey. Come here.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.688
Look at me.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.292
I know she would have loved
to be at your race.

08:12.359 --> 08:16.196
At every race. She wanted to
make your life safer.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.431
And mine.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.200
We kinda owe her,
don't you think?

08:22.703 --> 08:23.904
You're my mom.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.744
Hi, champ.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.982
Hey.
Hey.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.151
How's he doing?
This is always a tough day.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.519
It never gets easier.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.724
Durand.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.058
HARLOW: Hello, Nick.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.662
Harlow?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.099
I imagine you're in bed
with your new wife right now.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.936
How the hell are you calling me?

09:29.369 --> 09:30.604
Nick.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.840
Up and at 'em, Agent Durand.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.942
You have 60 minutes
if you push it.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.479
She won't last a second longer.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.748
Who is it?

09:42.549 --> 09:43.984
What are you talking about?

09:44.618 --> 09:45.953
She's alive.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.990
This is your second chance,
Nick.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.862
Life doesn't give us
second chances too often.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.331
Make the most of it.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.936
Take I-93 north, exit 44A.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.337
Nick.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.807
Follow the service road
up north,
What is happening?

10:06.874 --> 10:08.776
take a right.
What are you doing?

10:09.643 --> 10:10.911
There's a cabin there.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.747
Please! Stop! Just stop!

10:18.385 --> 10:20.087
Nick! Nick!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.522
I'm telling you it was Harlow,
he called me at home.

10:22.589 --> 10:25.558
He said it's a cabin,
support will meet me
at the access road.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.395
DISPATCH: Copy that, Nick.
Radford's on his way
to question Harlow.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.931
Let's see if he can
get anything
out of him.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.380
The cabin's 100 meters that way.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.316
Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:14.007 --> 11:15.008
Go.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.718
Cabin is empty, I repeat,
the cabin is empty.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.419
DISPATCH: Can you repeat that?

11:26.486 --> 11:29.122
Subject is not in the cabin.
I repeat,
subject is not in the cabin.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.224
Copy that.
Awaiting orders.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.364
Whoa. Move the flashlight! Move!

11:41.201 --> 11:43.804
Help me with these boards.
Help me with these boards.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.873
Get those boards off!
Get those boards off!

11:45.939 --> 11:48.075
Clear it. Clear it.
...help her.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.276
Get down. Now.

11:56.183 --> 12:01.221
Medic! Medic! We need a medic!

12:01.288 --> 12:05.158
It's her! It's her!
Open it up! Open it up!

12:05.225 --> 12:07.861
Send me a ladder.
Get a medic.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.763
Where's the water coming from?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.198
Down here.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.166
It won't open.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.667
Open it.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.403
Down with two.
Now left with two.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.371
Nick.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.247
Step back! Step back!

12:44.464 --> 12:46.934
Get her legs. Get her legs.
Go, go, go!

12:49.803 --> 12:51.238
Turn, turn, turn, turn.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.206
Easy. Easy.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.980
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.515
Can you squeeze my hand?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.784
Squeeze my hand.
You're safe now.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.290
Ma'am, squeeze my hand.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.159
Squeeze my hand if you
can hear me.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.101
Fifteen milligram, yeah.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.271
Hold her still.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.341
Emily!

13:28.408 --> 13:30.577
Emily! He's trying to help you!
He's trying to help you!

13:33.881 --> 13:35.048
Calm down!

13:35.115 --> 13:37.384
Here we go, here we go.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.586
Easy.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.196
Go... Go.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.066
REPORTER: Mr. Durand, what's it
like having Emily back?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.767
Where has she been?
How is she?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.204
Has she told you anything?
Can you give us
any information at all?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.172
Go!
Can you give us...

14:03.276 --> 14:07.280
Mr. Durand.
Has she said anything?
Mr. Durand!

14:10.617 --> 14:13.153
What do we have?
Found her under water in a tank.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.455
She's got minor cuts
and abrasions
and her breathing's shallow.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.691
Blood pressure 140/95,
tachycardia 145.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.161
What did you give her?
Fifteen milligrams Diazepam.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.230
What is her name?
Emily. Emily Byrne.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.298
Wait! You have to wait here!

14:45.852 --> 14:49.122
NEWS ANCHOR: FBI agent
Emily Byrne was found alive
early this morning.

14:49.189 --> 14:53.226
Declared dead in absentia,
Byrne is believed to be
a victim of Conrad Harlow,

14:53.293 --> 14:56.263
a suspect in several additional
missing person cases,

14:56.329 --> 14:59.066
who's currently serving life
for Byrne's murder.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.402
JACK: Nick.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.240
Have you heard anything?

15:08.741 --> 15:09.842
Not much.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.945
I'm kind of in
a holding pattern here.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.517
I'm sorry, excuse me, Jack.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.022
I've tried calling you.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.523
ALICE: I know.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.691
I'm sorry,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.260
I just saw it on the news.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.562
I just needed a moment to...

15:31.531 --> 15:32.699
I understand.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.106
How is she?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.640
I don't know.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.343
Her brother's here.
We're waiting for the doctor.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.179
How are you?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.115
Fine.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.084
Look, I can't say much
right now.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.652
About where she was or...

15:52.719 --> 15:54.054
You don't have to.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.090
Flynn just woke up.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
He's picking his clothes
for school.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.996
We shouldn't tell him yet.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.598
I wanna be there.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.800
Mom, do we have
time for waffles?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.236
Sure, honey.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.805
I have to go.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.574
Okay. Me, too.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.676
I love you.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.079
Okay.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.388
Flynn! Flynn! How do you feel
about your mother being alive
and back?

16:30.257 --> 16:32.459
Have you had any contact
with your mother?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.733
I should have kept
looking for her.

16:42.235 --> 16:46.005
No, no. We did everything
we could.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.043
You had to do right by Flynn.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.147
And what's he gonna
have to deal with now?

16:57.884 --> 16:59.252
How is she?

17:00.287 --> 17:01.454
Hi, I'm Dr. Fletcher.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.690
I'm sorry, this is Jack,
Emily's brother.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.092
She's stable.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.527
I know your colleagues
will want to speak with her,

17:07.594 --> 17:10.597
but we need
to proceed delicately.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.832
Do you have any idea
what happened to her?

17:12.899 --> 17:14.467
No, we're still running tests.

17:14.534 --> 17:18.205
She's having intermittent
laryngospasm,

17:18.271 --> 17:20.307
a sudden constricting
of the throat,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.575
usually in response to drowning.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.813
The second she opens her eyes,
gentlemen, you will know.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.116
Right now she needs to rest.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.750
Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.424
I need to do something.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.693
I need...
I need to go to the office.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.665
Let's start with the tank,
what was it for?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.568
Custom made. We're checking
regional manufacturers.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.804
The water was from the creek
out the back and the lock
was on a timer.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.975
CSU found traces
of hallucinogens
and nutrients in the water.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.644
What about the cabin?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.547
We're tracing ownership.
Locals say no one's
used it in decades.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.015
And forensics?

18:03.082 --> 18:07.154
No prints, no blood. Nothing.
Whoever cleaned it was good.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.190
We don't know if she was
in there
for six hours or six years.

18:10.257 --> 18:14.561
Had to be in and out of the tank
or the skin would start
to break down.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.663
Johnson and Briggs are going
house to house in the area

18:16.729 --> 18:19.299
to see if anybody saw
anyone coming or going.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.967
Vega's flying back from DC.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.003
He'll assist in Emily's debrief
and reassimilation.

18:24.070 --> 18:28.375
Crown, comb Harlow's
correspondence,
every letter, every visitor.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.109
Harlow's going to walk,
isn't he?

18:30.177 --> 18:34.181
Harlow called me, at my house.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.748
He told me where to find her.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.518
But Harlow's not admitting
he made the call.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.721
We tossed his cell,
checked the footage,
I even grilled him myself.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.923
We know he's involved.
He can't walk.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.159
But he went to jail for murder.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.361
Now he has to be retried
for abduction.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.363
Still no ID on the river body?

18:50.930 --> 18:52.232
No hits yet.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.202
The killer cut off
a man's eyelids.

18:55.268 --> 18:59.038
Someone out there had Emily
in that cabin,
it's the same person.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.940
We'll protect Emily.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.642
And we'll catch whoever did it.

19:03.843 --> 19:04.877
Now get to it.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.723
Take Emily's old case files.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.892
Look for anybody who
hates her enough
to be involved in this.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.829
You okay?

19:24.063 --> 19:26.333
Good. Let's get him.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.743
Emily.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.732
Hold her! Hold her!

19:59.799 --> 20:01.801
Hold her still! Hold her!
Grab her hands, Hold her!

20:01.868 --> 20:04.136
Goddamn journalist,
how did she get in here?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.105
Get her out of here!
Get her out!

20:06.172 --> 20:08.241
Calm down, Emily. Calm down.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.779
Where is she?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.847
Hey, relax, Nick.
I heard what she did.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.817
What she did was
an instinctive response.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.621
She perceived that journalist
as a threat and she acted.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.190
Is she still awake?

20:24.257 --> 20:28.227
Yes. You can see her.
Her father's with her already.
Come on.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.515
Emily

20:55.922 --> 20:58.491
I can send them away
if that's what you want.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.704
Flynn.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.942
Flynn's great.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.379
He looks so much like you.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.385
I'll show you.
I strongly suggest...

21:25.452 --> 21:27.954
I think my daughter
wants to see her son.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.467
There he is.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.843
How long?

21:51.243 --> 21:52.545
Emily,

21:55.648 --> 21:57.484
you've been gone six years.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.366
Please, let's give them
some time alone.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.537
Warren... Sorry.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.130
I had the perfect speech
prepared.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.011
Emily...

24:24.697 --> 24:27.133
Is this about the call
I'm supposed to have made?

24:29.168 --> 24:30.469
It's quite a mystery.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.607
Who had my wife in that cabin?

24:34.674 --> 24:37.043
I wish I knew.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.746
But I have faith
you'll find whoever framed me.

24:41.380 --> 24:45.852
How did you communicate
with this person
to arrange Emily's release?

24:47.920 --> 24:51.858
Now that she's free,
let's talk about my release.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.662
You're trying my patience.

24:55.728 --> 24:59.231
That's the thing about
doing time for a crime
you didn't commit.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.233
Don't you dare say that.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.735
It builds patience.

25:04.804 --> 25:09.709
I will make sure
things happen to you in here,

25:09.776 --> 25:11.911
things even you
wouldn't do to a person.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.050
How about making sure
you keep her safe this time?

25:32.565 --> 25:35.101
Step away, sir, step away!
Step away.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.273
He wore a mask.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.110
That's good.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.278
What else?

25:50.650 --> 25:52.184
I never saw his face.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.655
He's... He's still out there.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.228
You're gonna be fine.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.632
I promise you.

26:41.768 --> 26:45.371
Please...
I just want to go home.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.829
You know you don't
have to do this, Em.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.698
Maybe it's too much too soon.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.701
No, I need to see Flynn.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.269
Okay.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.707
Well, look, if it gets to be
too much
then you just let me know

27:20.773 --> 27:23.175
and we'll get outta there. Okay?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.276
Okay.

27:25.778 --> 27:26.979
Okay.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.232
This is it.

28:07.653 --> 28:11.290
I asked you. They're here
in 10 minutes.
How am I supposed to do...

28:11.357 --> 28:14.293
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
I forgot to fix it,
I forgot to fix it.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.595
I'm sorry. It's not like
I had a ton of time.

28:16.662 --> 28:19.498
You know what I've been
going through.
And I'm not going through it?

28:19.565 --> 28:22.701
She just needs to feel welcome.
She just needs to be...

28:23.469 --> 28:24.837
I know this.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.572
She's not going to care
about the dishwasher.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.308
Why do you think I want
everything to be all right
for her to arrive?

28:41.487 --> 28:43.422
Hi, come in, come in.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.726
It's this way.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.370
This is Alice.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.383
Is this Riggs?

29:13.552 --> 29:14.787
Yeah.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.757
Hi, puppy.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.462
Hello.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.324
Come here.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.333
Oh, my God.

30:06.138 --> 30:09.275
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm happy to see you.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.348
Oh, my God, look at you.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.092
Look at you,
you're so beautiful.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.160
Tall.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.570
Flynn, why don't you
show your mother your room?

30:41.440 --> 30:42.474
Okay.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.915
It's just the dishwasher.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.287
You can sit on my bed,
if you want.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.523
Yeah.

31:46.005 --> 31:50.109
I'm sorry about downstairs,
Flynn.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.012
The last time that I saw you,
you were very little.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.414
You hurt my mom.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.322
Your mom

32:03.389 --> 32:06.325
They were fighting.
They never fight.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.244
I'm sorry.

32:33.152 --> 32:36.055
Em! Emily, what happened?
What's going on?

32:36.122 --> 32:38.890
Hey.
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.726
Hey, it's okay.
Nick, please.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.629
I know, I know...

32:52.538 --> 32:54.240
He hates me.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.509
He hates me.
No, no, no.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.615
Listen to me.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.218
Listen, listen.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.224
I'm asking you
to fight through this.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.360
Flynn deserves to
know the real you.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.766
Just go back inside, Nick.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.203
Go back to your wife.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.134
So, this is me.

33:58.337 --> 34:01.373
The kitchen...
The kitchen's through there

34:01.440 --> 34:04.543
and the bathroom's back that way
where the bedroom...

34:06.845 --> 34:08.314
Hey, give me your bag.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.617
Yeah. Okay.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.388
Do you... Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?

34:24.230 --> 34:25.697
Yeah...

34:28.100 --> 34:30.269
I'm selling
medical supplies now.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.239
You don't practice anymore?

34:33.305 --> 34:35.841
No. No, I lost my license.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.646
Things kind of
got away from me

34:40.712 --> 34:43.382
after everything
that happened, but...

34:44.216 --> 34:46.352
Hey, look, it's been...

34:46.418 --> 34:50.756
Two years, two months
and 23 days, so...

34:52.124 --> 34:54.626
I'm good, Em. Life's good.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.867
Oh, hey! These came for you.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.341
They were on the doorstep
this morning when I got in.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.511
I think they're from
your friends
at the FBI.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.654
Look, it's late.
You must be tired.
Let me show you your room.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.391
You're gonna stay in mine.
No. No, it's okay.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.827
I'll sleep on the couch.

35:28.894 --> 35:29.995
You sure?

35:30.061 --> 35:31.797
Yeah, I don't want
to put you out.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.566
Well, look, I'll get you
some sheets and pillows.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.475
EMILY: It's like my mind is
working against me.

35:43.542 --> 35:47.479
I can't remember anything
except for the mask and...

35:50.081 --> 35:51.517
Harlow's voice.

35:54.853 --> 35:55.854
The tank.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.025
DR. VEGA: The FBI,

36:00.091 --> 36:04.330
they asked me if they
can observe the sessions
from now on.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.398
Do you have
any problems with that?

36:21.112 --> 36:25.116
Perhaps the eye symbolizes
something you saw.

36:25.183 --> 36:29.788
Something so traumatic that
probably you had to block it.

36:43.168 --> 36:45.070
EMILY: I've been reading about
some of these techniques.

36:45.136 --> 36:48.173
There's hypnosis
and Pentobarbital.
I want to try one.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.576
DR. VEGA: Emily, there are
reasons those aren't
accepted forms

36:50.642 --> 36:55.281
of Recovered Memory therapy.
Results are often unreliable,

36:55.347 --> 36:57.849
even fantasy...
I don't care.

36:59.184 --> 37:02.988
I will take any result
over nothing.

37:03.054 --> 37:07.526
DR. VEGA: Have you heard of
a process called
"cognitive interviewing?"

37:18.003 --> 37:19.438
EMILY: I remember the rhythm.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.141
The pump...

37:23.208 --> 37:25.877
DR. VEGA: Stay with the eye.
Stay with the eye, Emily.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.947
Stay with your vision, remember
the first time you saw it.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.883
I can see a lot of flowers.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.886
Good. That's very good.
Keep going.
Tell me about the flowers.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.289
Dahlia.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.626
Lily.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.728
Rose.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.497
Poppy.

37:46.164 --> 37:47.533
Senna.

37:50.836 --> 37:51.837
Violet.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.574
Jasmine.

38:00.612 --> 38:05.684
Robert Semerov. Sex trafficker.
One of Emily's early cases.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.520
She could never come up
with enough evidence
to make an arrest.

38:08.587 --> 38:12.157
She made him mad enough
to take out
a contract on her though.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.361
We've seen her sessions
with Vega.
Here's the connection,

38:17.195 --> 38:21.232
Robert Semerov had a habit
of naming his favorite girls

38:21.299 --> 38:23.502
after flowers.

38:23.569 --> 38:26.472
No known address,
but we do have this.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.942
That's Semerov's Benz
last night.

38:32.611 --> 38:36.014
Crown, Ericson, find the link
between Semerov and Harlow.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.783
The rest of you, find Semerov.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.854
Results came in
on the river body.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.958
I found trace amounts of tissue
deep under the dead man's
right index fingernail.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.760
BPD must have missed it.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.296
That's Semerov's skin
under that fingernail.
We just need to confirm it.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.999
I already checked, we don't have
a sample of his DNA on file.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.968
We'll get one.
Try our friends at BPD.
Walk with me.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.712
Detective Gibbs?

39:07.813 --> 39:08.947
Thanks.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.685
Take a walk, Feeb.
You stole my body
from the Charles.

39:13.752 --> 39:17.322
Which is why one of us
coming here to ask you
a favor is so awkward.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.890
And yet, here I am.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.191
What is it?

39:20.258 --> 39:22.728
I want to know if you have
someone's DNA on file.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.330
Robert Semerov. Traffics girls
from the Eastern Bloc.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.998
He's not in any system.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.734
I heard of him.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.837
We were hoping you guys
had it in an evidence file
from an old case.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.706
You think he's the one
who took my floater's eyelids?

39:36.408 --> 39:38.043
You're gonna you help me or not?

39:40.045 --> 39:43.214
It's always a one way street
with you Feds, huh?

39:43.281 --> 39:44.750
Thanks. I'll owe you one.

39:47.953 --> 39:48.887
EMILY: Riggs! Riggs!

39:48.954 --> 39:51.990
Come on, look at this.
Go through.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.826
Look at him. Look at Riggs.

39:54.893 --> 40:00.532
Hello, honey. Come here.
What is this

40:00.599 --> 40:03.168
Come here, Riggs.
Come here. Hi.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.909
We need your help.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.778
We think there might
be a connection

41:19.845 --> 41:22.748
between one of your old cases
and your abduction.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.752
Robert Semerov.
Could he have been at the cabin?

41:34.192 --> 41:38.463
I remember the case, I don't
remember seeing him
at the cabin.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.967
Doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Just think back,
I know it's difficult.

41:42.033 --> 41:45.604
If you don't believe me,
Nick, why are you even
asking the question?

41:47.673 --> 41:49.240
I'm trying to help you, Emily.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.511
We're in this together.
Don't say that.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.082
You're not the one
who was taken.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.152
You're the one
who was fucking somebody else.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.765
Okay, I'll go.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.635
But I'm telling you
Robert Semerov was there.

42:16.702 --> 42:20.038
The girls he trafficked,
he gave them all names.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.874
Flowers. I watched you
rattle them off to Dr. Vega.

42:22.941 --> 42:26.111
Iris and Dahlia and Lily and...

42:31.516 --> 42:32.718
Em...

42:42.127 --> 42:45.731
Iris, Dahlia, Lily...

42:45.797 --> 42:48.199
You need to put those down.
That's evidence.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.371
Yeah, give me forensics.

42:53.438 --> 42:57.508
Emily... Can you think
of anything you would
have left out of Semerov's case?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.978
Anything that could
get us a lead on him?

43:00.045 --> 43:01.346
No.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.281
Hi, yeah, I need
an evidence pickup

43:03.348 --> 43:06.084
at Jack Byrne's apartment.
Emily's brother's place.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.887
Copy that. I'll text you now.

43:09.988 --> 43:12.357
Hey, you were undercover.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.226
You know his operation.
Is there any safe houses
he used?

43:15.293 --> 43:19.164
Any aliases that he
traveled under?
Did he have any contacts?

43:19.865 --> 43:21.499
There was somebody...

43:21.566 --> 43:23.702
Can you get in touch with him?

43:23.769 --> 43:25.070
She'll only talk to me.

44:22.694 --> 44:24.830
I saw the news. How are you?

44:24.896 --> 44:26.231
I'm all right.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.900
I need your help.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.268
You know I owe you.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.004
It's about Semerov.

44:35.173 --> 44:40.912
Please, anything but that.
Anyone but him.

44:40.979 --> 44:44.883
He's hurt us both.
But we can stop him.

44:46.384 --> 44:47.719
Where can I find him?

44:49.888 --> 44:51.489
You have tried before.

44:51.556 --> 44:54.793
I can get him out of your life
for good this time, I promise.

44:58.730 --> 45:01.967
The girls are talking
about a shipment. Tomorrow.

45:03.168 --> 45:04.435
Where?

45:11.843 --> 45:13.979
Did you know she was
going to pull this?

45:16.281 --> 45:17.315
No.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.755
If you know how to find Semerov,

45:24.489 --> 45:25.757
you have to tell us.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.895
He might be the person
who had me, Adam.

45:33.431 --> 45:35.300
I want to be there.

45:35.366 --> 45:36.835
You know you're not
ready for this.

45:36.902 --> 45:38.103
I am ready.

45:41.672 --> 45:43.074
We just want to protect you.

46:12.237 --> 46:13.238
Emily!

46:15.740 --> 46:16.975
He approved.

46:20.846 --> 46:22.814
This is a one-time deal, Emily.

46:26.751 --> 46:28.053
Now, what do you have?

46:50.808 --> 46:52.577
Don't move till
we see the girls.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.925
NICK: Does anyone have
eyes on Semerov?

47:06.992 --> 47:08.960
MAN: Negative. He should be
in that car.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.275
They're out.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.510
Go!

47:25.576 --> 47:26.945
FBI!

47:32.350 --> 47:33.418
Don't move!

47:34.552 --> 47:37.055
Don't move! Semerov, out!

47:37.122 --> 47:38.823
Emily! Emily!

47:38.890 --> 47:39.891
Stay there.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.392
Hands where I can see them.

47:43.328 --> 47:46.932
Who are you
Out of the vehicle!

47:46.998 --> 47:48.399
I don't know who is Semerov.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.735
Hand on the car. Spread 'em.
Come on.

47:50.801 --> 47:51.903
Come on, move.

47:51.970 --> 47:52.971
Come on. Move it.

47:53.038 --> 47:54.305
Come on. Come on.

48:01.746 --> 48:04.015
Yeah
I can't hear you.

48:04.082 --> 48:05.984
Yes, but now is not the time.

48:08.987 --> 48:12.023
Who are you

48:12.090 --> 48:14.425
What's your name?
Where is Semerov?

48:14.492 --> 48:17.128
I don't know.
I don't see him for two years!

48:18.930 --> 48:20.365
Where's Semerov?

48:24.169 --> 48:25.570
Talk! Talk!
Emily!

48:28.073 --> 48:30.375
Emily. Emily.

48:30.441 --> 48:34.479
Make him talk!
Nick, make him talk!
He knows!

48:35.313 --> 48:36.781
Don't look back. Calm down.

48:36.847 --> 48:38.116
Adam. Adam!

48:38.783 --> 48:40.018
That was Whitman.

48:40.551 --> 48:41.719
We got a hit?

48:41.786 --> 48:43.955
The DNA under the nails
didn't match Semerov.

48:44.022 --> 48:45.890
The body itself did.
What?

48:45.957 --> 48:48.026
The body in the river,
it was Semerov.

48:48.093 --> 48:51.929
We've been looking for this guy
all over and he was in
the morgue the whole time.

48:51.997 --> 48:53.198
Get inside.

48:54.332 --> 48:56.534
What about the killer's DNA
under the nails?

48:56.601 --> 48:59.070
Unfortunately, we got
a match on that, too.

49:01.106 --> 49:02.340
Unfortunately?

49:02.407 --> 49:04.209
The DNA belongs to Emily.

49:07.378 --> 49:08.913
It's a mistake. Redo it.

49:08.980 --> 49:11.649
Whitman already did.
Three times.

49:18.923 --> 49:20.225
What?
