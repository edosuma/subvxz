WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:07.374
BERRIN: Take.
GORDON: Harness?
BERRIN: Oui.

00:07.374 --> 00:08.909
GORDON: But where
are the mushrooms?

00:08.909 --> 00:10.043
BERRIN: Down.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.378
GORDON: The
mushrooms are where?

00:11.378 --> 00:12.779
BERRIN: There.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.281
GORDON: Holy (bleep).

00:14.281 --> 00:16.617
The name is Gordon James,
yeah, not James Bond.

00:17.784 --> 00:18.986
Look at that.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.254
All this for a mushroom.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.655
It better be delicious.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.524
This is insane. (bleep)!

00:34.301 --> 00:36.270
I'm in Morocco, North Africa,

00:36.270 --> 00:39.439
to discover the
hidden culinary secrets
of this incredible country.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.778
I've always loved Moroccan
food because every bite is
steeped in history.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.447
Over the centuries the Arabs,

00:47.447 --> 00:50.350
Spanish, Ottomans and
French have all left their mark

00:50.350 --> 00:53.020
on the cuisine of the
indigenous Berber people.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.493
My journey of discovery begins
in Fes, North West Morocco,

01:00.928 --> 01:02.863
the country's culinary capital,

01:02.863 --> 01:05.599
located on the edge
of the Middle Atlas Mountains.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.240
The Medina of Fes
is one of the oldest
walled cities in the world.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.743
It feels like I've been
transported back in time.

01:18.445 --> 01:21.348
Incredible and
beautiful and confusing all at
the same fricking time.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.384
Man, so.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.788
This place is
like a labyrinth.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.656
This is crazy.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.427
There's over 9,000
alleyways and I think
I've been down every one.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.396
The most confusing maze ever.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.634
I'm supposed to be meeting one
of Morocco's finest chefs,
Najat Kaanache.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.003
MAN: Bonjour, ca‐va?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.375
GORDON: I am lost.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.345
But finding our rendezvous
point is proving trickier
than I expected.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.017
(bleep) Okay, I'm pretty
sure this is the spot.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.188
NAJAT: Oh my god!
How are you?

02:01.822 --> 02:03.256
GORDON: Finally.

02:03.256 --> 02:06.927
Najat Kaanache is one
of a small band of
pioneering female chefs,

02:07.761 --> 02:09.463
changing the face
of Moroccan cuisine.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.932
NAJAT: Voila.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.034
GORDON: After earning her
stripes at a string of
Michelin Star establishments

02:14.034 --> 02:15.802
across Europe and America,

02:15.802 --> 02:19.039
her own restaurant
in the heart of the
Medina is already gaining

02:19.039 --> 02:20.607
quite a reputation.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.044
The first thing I
thought about, what would it
be like to have a restaurant

02:24.044 --> 02:26.313
here with all this
product on your doorstep.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.315
GORDON: Amazing.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.952
GORDON: Do you ever
get lost down here?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.153
NAJAT: You get lost.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.688
Even if you live in
here you get lost.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.023
It is, it is, it is...

02:36.023 --> 02:37.557
GORDON: So I'm
not the only one.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.893
NAJAT: I get lost and
I used to walk in this
Medina barefoot so imagine.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.461
GORDON: In bare feet.
NAJAT: Barefoot.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.896
GORDON: It's so
nice to meet you.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.264
NAJAT: Thank you.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.234
GORDON: Now I'm dying
to get really underneath
this incredible oasis.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.502
NAJAT: Thank you very
much for coming here.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.070
GORDON: Can you lead the
way 'cause I'm useless.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.238
NAJAT: We walk.
GORDON: Okay.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.739
NAJAT: Shall we go?
GORDON: Straight up?

02:52.739 --> 02:55.142
Go on. Thank you.
This place is crazy!

02:56.543 --> 02:59.479
Najat tells me this
has been a food market since
the ninth century.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.053
NAJAT: This is the
flavors of Morocco.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.554
GORDON: Wow!

03:07.554 --> 03:09.022
NAJAT: Like here,
look at the colors.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.290
GORDON: Just the colors,
the colors.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.092
NAJAT: Try this one.
GORDON: Thank you.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.493
Mm, that's delicious.

03:13.493 --> 03:14.961
NAJAT: You know chillies.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.898
You're too white for
hotness, I understand.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.467
GORDON: I'm too
white for hotness, did
you just say that to me?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.539
GORDON: I love chili.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.274
(speaking in native language).

03:27.641 --> 03:29.242
GORDON: Delicious,
Pretty good, thank you.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.410
Amazing.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.978
NAJAT: Look,
look at the meat man.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.483
NAJAT: You like to
speak French yeah?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.019
GORDON: And what is that?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.921
NAJAT: This is a
smooth butter.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.989
I need you to smell.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.191
GORDON: Ooh, bloody hell.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.565
GORDON: Yes, I've made filo
but that's not filo though.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.168
GORDON: Okay right, okay.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.837
It looks like my
grandma's curtains.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.972
So is it flour and water?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.308
NAJAT: You're hilarious.
This is water and flour.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.977
GORDON: That is beautiful.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.079
NAJAT: I think you
should go inside and try.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.881
GORDON: Try that?
NAJAT: Yes.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.783
GORDON: And if I (bleep)?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.452
NAJAT: Now I'm going to
correct you because I'm
allowed to do that today.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.455
GORDON: Would you tell
her I'm a cook in English?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.691
She's looking at me
like I'm an idiot.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.560
NAJAT: Okay now let's go.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.266
You have to stretch
it without pressing.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.136
WOMAN: Bravo.
NAJAT: Bravo she says.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.005
NAJAT: It's so
wonderful to see you do this.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.707
GORDON: Yes.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.710
When Najat finally
stops laughing at me, I
manage to finish my pastry.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.480
NAJAT: Now stretch it
and bring it in here yeah.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.283
GORDON: Yeah.
NAJAT: Let's go. Wow.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.454
Mr. Gordon, man, bravo!
Awesome.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.390
Yeah you like this more.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.325
GORDON: It's thin enough?

04:52.325 --> 04:55.462
NAJAT: So now, hello,
now you have to be
careful when it cooks.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.397
You gotta bring it up.

04:57.397 --> 04:58.932
GORDON: Gotcha.
NAJAT: Take it up.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.801
GORDON: (bleep).
NAJAT: That on top.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.237
GORDON: Thank you.
WOMAN: Bravo.
GORDON: Thank you so much.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.641
NAJAT: So easy.
GORDON: I wouldn't say easy.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.543
Au revoir.
Merci beaucoup.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.246
Man, it's a lot harder than
it looks, let me tell you.

05:13.246 --> 05:18.018
I'm not very good at being
crap at doing something, so
I felt a little bit awkward.

05:18.618 --> 05:19.820
That was difficult.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.888
NAJAT: Well not difficult,
it's a lot of practice Chef.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.690
GORDON: Najat is a
little firecracker.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.592
That's how feisty she is.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.594
Right now I feel like
a fish out of water.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.238
NAJAT: I'm going to invite
you to serve us two beautiful
magical glasses of tea,

05:38.872 --> 05:39.906
how about that?

05:39.906 --> 05:41.241
GORDON: You'd like a glass.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.377
NAJAT: Well I'd like
glass poured by you
from all the way up.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.079
Come on, you can do it.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.147
GORDON: Ready?

05:47.147 --> 05:50.016
NAJAT: Yeah.
Go, oh my god you're a pro.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.653
Yeah, that's it.
You've passed your exam.

05:53.653 --> 05:57.190
GORDON: I've made a
discovery about Najat
that may just explain her

05:57.858 --> 05:59.960
attitude towards me.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.928
You are a powerful
chef here aren't you?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.196
NAJAT: Yes sir.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.765
GORDON: And you
applied to work in my
restaurant seven times.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.601
NAJAT: Yeah and
you never hired me.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.069
GORDON: You should
have phoned me.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.971
I would have given
you a job any day.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.739
Stop it.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.042
I can't believe I
didn't hire Najat.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.979
Hopefully she's moved
past it or the only dish
I'll be eating on my

06:18.979 --> 06:21.314
Moroccan journey is humble pie.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.149
NAJAT: I want you to
go to the mountains.

06:23.149 --> 06:24.451
GORDON: You want me to
go to the mountains.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.119
NAJAT: Yes.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.421
To the Berber land with
the people who really still
have the traditions and the

06:28.421 --> 06:29.589
way of cooking.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.091
GORDON: Right.

06:31.091 --> 06:34.561
NAJAT: At the end of this
week is the New Years
for the Berber people.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.599
GORDON: Wait, at the end of
the week is New Year's Eve?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.802
NAJAT: You and
me going to cook.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.639
GORDON: But I want you
to kick my butt in there.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.941
NAJAT: We will,
that's my territory.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.678
GORDON: So that's how
it's gonna work, you're
sending me out there.

06:51.678 --> 06:55.749
NAJAT: I want to send you
out there and if you don't
apply to all this knowledge

06:55.749 --> 06:58.852
that you got from
this beautiful Fes,
we're going to butcher you.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.154
How about that?

07:01.154 --> 07:05.191
GORDON: (bleep) Najat has
just dropped the bombshell
because not only am I going

07:05.191 --> 07:10.630
to the mountains to understand
that Berber culture, I'm cooking
a feast at the end of the week

07:11.431 --> 07:14.401
on one of the most
important nights of the
year, New Year's Eve.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.769
Where do I start?

07:15.769 --> 07:18.104
NAJAT: First, I would
really love you to meet
the mushroom man.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.274
He's super magical and he
has white hair like you
but he's great.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.645
And he has the best truffles,
the best morels, the best
(inaudible).

07:25.645 --> 07:27.380
GORDON:
They're the Rolls Royce
of mushrooms, morel mushrooms.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.150
NAJAT: Yes.
GORDON: This is amazing. Cheers.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.255
NAJAT: I think he's gonna find
a few difficulties 'cause you
have to go from three star

07:35.255 --> 07:38.758
Michelin chef to be
in the nature, to be
with the Berber people.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.929
So he's gonna have a couple
of few difficulties in that.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.046
GORDON: With just
five days 'til we
cook a feast for New Year,

08:00.046 --> 08:02.182
my mission is clear;

08:02.182 --> 08:05.418
head into the mountains
to get to grips with the
magic of Berber cuisine.

08:06.686 --> 08:07.988
Look at this view.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.289
Come on!

08:09.289 --> 08:11.591
It doesn't get any
better than that.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.362
Najat's arranged for her
mushroom hunters to meet me.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.665
She said that these
guys are secretive,

08:19.032 --> 08:21.468
so secretive that
they've got special ways to

08:21.468 --> 08:23.703
get you to the
locations of these mushrooms.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.775
Najat's being a bit coy
about what she's set up
but she's told me to expect

08:28.775 --> 08:30.543
quite an adventure.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.213
The air conditioner's
work in here.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.615
Just checking the
brakes are working.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.285
Bonjour.
Merci beaucoup.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.954
BERRIN: Ca va.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.158
BERRIN: Oui.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.327
(speaking in native language).

08:47.327 --> 08:50.697
GORDON: My first surprise
comes when my guide starts
looking to harness me up.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.265
But where are the mushrooms?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.500
BERRIN: Down.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.603
GORDON: The
mushrooms are where?

08:57.670 --> 09:00.573
Oh, you are kidding me!

09:00.573 --> 09:02.942
Najat's (bleep) crazy.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.445
There must be an easier way
to get to these mushrooms.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.147
BERRIN: Okay.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.051
GORDON: The name is
Gordon James, yeah,
not James Bond.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.653
I just want to pick mushrooms.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.456
But apparently this is
Najat's idea of a good time.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.958
Listen I love
mushrooms but this is insane.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.660
All this for a mushroom.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.562
It'd better be delicious.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.072
GORDON: (bleep),
(bleep) (bleep)!

09:35.241 --> 09:37.110
Look at that.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.686
Holy (bleep), (bleep)!

09:46.686 --> 09:49.889
Oh man! Seriously?

09:56.796 --> 09:58.531
GORDON: (bleep), really?

09:58.531 --> 10:01.801
I think I'm paying the
price for not giving
Moroccan chef Najat a job.

10:03.236 --> 10:07.707
She's sent me on the scenic
route to meet up with
mysterious mushroom hunters.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.053
I'm a big adventurer
and I love mushrooms but
that's the scariest descent

10:20.053 --> 10:22.222
that I've ever done for a
mushroom, but I loved it.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.724
As soon as I got down to the
bottom I wanted to go back up

10:24.724 --> 10:26.860
to the top and come back down.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.498
Bonjour!

10:32.232 --> 10:33.933
Okay, where are the mushrooms?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.138
GORDON: Thanks a lot.
KARDA: Okay.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.247
GORDON: These mushrooms
better taste delicious.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.915
(speaking in native language).

10:48.915 --> 10:50.283
Good, good.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.651
GORDON: (bleep)!

10:51.651 --> 10:53.186
Bonjour, how are you?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.587
ABDULLAH: I'm the
king of the mushrooms.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.788
GORDON: You're the
king of the mushrooms.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.123
Where are the
bloody mushrooms?

10:57.123 --> 10:58.491
(speaking in native language).

10:58.491 --> 11:01.494
Let's go. Let's go.
I doubt anyone's following us.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.865
GORDON: Abdullah
is Chef Najat's main
mushroom supplier.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.536
He and his men have
spent the last few days
foraging this remote forest,

11:10.236 --> 11:13.006
and today they're willing
to share with me the pick
of their bounty.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.777
Every chef in Britain
would love to get their
hands on that basket.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.779
Oh my lord!

11:19.779 --> 11:21.781
Thank you. Chanterelle.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.218
ABDULLAH: Chanterelle, morels.
GORDON: Ceps and morels.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.954
All in the same back garden.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.891
From a chef's point of
view, it's a magical basket.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.694
Can you imagine what
they taste like cooked?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.133
BERRIN: Have you
heard about...

11:41.868 --> 11:43.203
GORDON: Medfouna?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.004
BERRIN: Yes, that's
what I plan to do now.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.040
GORDON: It's like a.
BERRIN: A Berber pizza.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.242
GORDON: A Berber pizza.
BERRIN: Yes.

11:49.242 --> 11:53.246
GORDON: My newfound friend,
Berrin, gives me a masterclass
on how the Berber's cook pizza

11:53.246 --> 11:54.914
in the mountains.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.417
Spoiler alert, it's a bit
different from Domino's.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.553
BERRIN: You use the
most expensive
mushrooms in the world.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.355
GORDON: Abdullah, magic.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.059
GORDON: This is a
dream for me, Abdullah.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.094
I love you.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.231
We'll put the
porcini in first.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.300
Then the girolle there.

12:15.668 --> 12:20.573
Then I'll put the morel
and then trumpette,
some onions and garlic.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.247
BERRIN: Ras el hanout.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.650
GORDON: Ras el hanout is a
mix of spices widely used
in Moroccan cuisine.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.886
BERRIN: Perfect.
GORDON: Bread.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.256
I saw this on my
visit in the Medina.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.392
Yeah so nice and flat.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.262
Now I'm starting to understand
what Najat was explaining,

12:42.262 --> 12:46.299
get closer to the Berber's,
understand what the
village is doing.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.671
Mushrooms in. Look at this.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.109
BERRIN: Now goat cheese.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.845
GORDON: Wow, this is getting
better and better and better.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.381
So goat's cheese and
give it saltiness right?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.615
BERRIN: Yes.
GORDON: Nice.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.050
BERRIN: It's a very
nice combination yeah?

13:04.050 --> 13:06.019
GORDON: This is a
beautiful combination.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.620
Now for the lid.

13:09.889 --> 13:13.426
That goes on top.
Back on.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.230
BERRIN: The Berber's,
they like making this.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.368
They live in the mountains
and there the mushrooms
are everywhere, you know.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.870
GORDON: What a treat.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.838
BERRIN: Take some
olive branches.

13:26.205 --> 13:29.575
GORDON: Right so it's cooking
on the bottom and the top.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.911
BERRIN: On the
bottom and the top, yes.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.413
GORDON: Yeah. Amazing.
BERRIN: And warming us up.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.049
GORDON: And
keeping us warm, yeah.

13:37.150 --> 13:41.888
I've rappelled for them,
I've swam for them and now
it's finally time to eat

13:42.955 --> 13:44.424
these precious mushrooms.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.060
Abdullah. Look at that!

13:49.862 --> 13:51.998
GORDON: Really beautiful.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.035
Look, I mean it
just looks delicious.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.048
GORDON: Wow.
That is absolutely delicious.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.555
That was one of the best
pizzas I've ever eaten.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.525
Putting a slice of that on
my menu back home in London,

14:20.259 --> 14:23.196
you'd have to charge
an excess of £100.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.131
It's delicious.

14:25.131 --> 14:28.634
The shock for me is that
for the boys it's a staple,
they eat that every day.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.237
That's, that's
the big surprise.

14:31.838 --> 14:35.641
The luxuriousness of those
mushrooms sandwiched between
two slices of dough,

14:36.843 --> 14:38.745
(bleep) brilliant.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.381
Now I wanna be a Berber.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.222
With the Berber New Year
just days away, the
pressure is really on.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.594
I'm desperate to show
Chef Najat that I can
cut it in the world of

14:54.594 --> 14:58.765
Moroccan cuisine, and that
means understanding every
aspect of the Berber life.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.103
(speaking in native language).

15:04.103 --> 15:05.705
Cold. Froid.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.074
I'm so thrilled that Karda,

15:08.074 --> 15:09.776
one of Abdullah's
mushroom hunters,

15:09.776 --> 15:12.545
has invited me to lunch
in the village where he
and his family live.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.313
Amazing.

15:14.313 --> 15:15.515
So this is it?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.550
BERRIN: Yes.
GORDON: A la maison.
BERRIN: A la maison.

15:19.685 --> 15:23.790
GORDON: Hello. Bonjour.
How are you?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.028
BERRIN: She's a little bit shy.
GORDON: She's a little bit shy.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.096
And what's her name?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.964
FATIMA: Fatima.
BERRIN: Fatima.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.533
GORDON: Fatima,
it's a beautiful name.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.101
And how old is Fatima?

15:35.101 --> 15:37.303
BERRIN: Nine years.
GORDON: Nine.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.772
After you. Thank you.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.544
Karda and his daughter
Fatima want to show me every
element of Berber life,

15:44.544 --> 15:47.380
including the barn that houses
their four‐legged friend.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.183
Wow. Huge donkey!

15:50.183 --> 15:51.818
Is that your taxi to school?

15:52.418 --> 15:54.520
(speaking in native language).

15:54.520 --> 15:56.422
My daughters get an Uber,
you get a donkey.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.257
I'd love to try
and ride that thing.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.126
You show me?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.861
(speaking in native language).

16:02.195 --> 16:04.030
Okay.

16:05.331 --> 16:06.632
You sure it's
gonna take my weight?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.735
GORDON: You sure? Fatima?

16:09.735 --> 16:11.070
(speaking in native language).

16:11.504 --> 16:13.940
Oh. Ooh sugar!

16:14.407 --> 16:16.943
I'm too old to ride a donkey.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.478
BERRIN: You want to
make it move you say...

16:18.878 --> 16:20.213
(speaking in native language).

16:20.213 --> 16:22.849
(speaking in native language).

16:22.849 --> 16:26.619
Please! Okay, good.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.956
Right.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.293
(bleep) oh man!

16:35.695 --> 16:39.131
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.068
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.239
I've never been shown how
to ride one so thank you,
Fatima, well done.

16:49.108 --> 16:53.212
After embarrassing
myself riding the donkey,
Karda and Fatima show me

16:53.212 --> 16:55.314
around the village and
its traditional way of life.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.522
Bonjour.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.824
Karda introduces
me to his mum.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.494
She still uses carpet
weaving techniques that go
back to the 12th century.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.798
What kind of wool is that?

17:12.798 --> 17:14.567
BERRIN: Sheep.
GORDON: Sheep's wool.
BERRIN: Sheep wool.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.236
GORDON: It's amazing
how it's not breaking.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.005
Oh look at the speed of her.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.741
Look, right.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.876
Grandma you make
this look so easy.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.945
And where will you
sell these carpets?

17:25.945 --> 17:27.813
BERRIN: They just take
it to the nearest town.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.081
GORDON: So you go
into the Medina?

17:29.081 --> 17:30.316
BERRIN: Yes.

17:30.316 --> 17:31.517
GORDON: And how much
would one of these cost?

17:31.517 --> 17:33.019
BERRIN: About
2,500 Moroccan Dirham.

17:33.019 --> 17:37.456
GORDON: 2,500 Dirham
is about 260 bucks.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.228
GORDON: Okay.
Here we go.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.132
(speaking in native language).

17:46.132 --> 17:47.533
BERRIN: She's
saying you're too slow.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.268
GORDON: Too slow!

17:49.268 --> 17:52.004
(speaking in native language).

17:53.239 --> 17:54.707
Happy mamma?

17:54.707 --> 17:57.310
Oh man! Oh Fatima!

17:58.377 --> 18:00.980
(feigns sobbing)

18:01.314 --> 18:03.950
That is an amazing skill.
Merci madame.

18:06.886 --> 18:10.389
Now for the bit of Berber
culture I'm most
intrigued by, lunch.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.059
Wow.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.427
BERRIN: Yes please.
GORDON: Of course.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.128
So this is the dining room.

18:16.128 --> 18:19.966
BERRIN: Come.
GORDON: Thank you. Amazing.
This is lovely in here.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.274
BERRIN: Some local food.
This is what the people eat.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.042
GORDON: They
look like lentils.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.278
BERRIN: Lentils.
This is clarified butter.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.879
GORDON: Right.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.449
BERRIN: This is olive oil
and this is olive from this
same make of this one.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.318
GORDON: Wow, the bread
is baked here as well?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.988
BERRIN: Yes, People here
they make their own food,

18:41.988 --> 18:43.889
they don't buy
bread from a shop.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.625
GORDON: This food
looks incredible.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.060
BERRIN: Before we eat
we always say Bismillah.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.230
GORDON: Bismillah.
BERRIN: Bismillah. Yes.
GORDON: Thank you.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.269
Mm. They're delicious.

18:59.772 --> 19:04.043
It's so good.
I'm so excited to be here.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.214
This weekend is your
Berber New Year celebration.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.917
BERRIN: Berber New Year
is a very big day here in
the Atlas Mountains.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.354
Everyone in the
village celebrate you know.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.890
GORDON: And it's all about
the food and the celebration.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.525
BERRIN: It's all
about the food yes.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.726
GORDON: Wow.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.361
The pressures on
me even more now,

19:22.361 --> 19:25.131
not just for the standard
you produce but the New
Year celebration.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.466
Boy!

19:27.466 --> 19:29.468
BERRIN: Better to be ready.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.270
GORDON: Yeah and
I'd better be ready.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.805
(speaking in native language).

19:32.805 --> 19:35.474
BERRIN: Do you like it?
GORDON: It is delicious.

19:35.474 --> 19:36.809
Do you know any British food?

19:38.811 --> 19:41.847
GORDON: Yes!
That's good, that's very good.
Thank you.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.619
This local olive oil
tastes amazing, so I'm
keen to discover how the

19:46.619 --> 19:48.454
Berber's make it.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.889
Bonjour.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.192
They've been making olive
oil in this region since
before Roman times and

19:53.192 --> 19:56.395
I'm dying to get my
hands on some to use
in my New Year feast.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.899
Oh man!

20:00.866 --> 20:02.101
And these have just
been picked right?

20:02.101 --> 20:05.638
BERRIN: Yes.
GORDON: Okay.
BERRIN: Okay, let's try.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.575
GORDON: The first thing
I've got to do is crush
down the olives using

20:09.575 --> 20:11.110
the ancient grinder.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.546
But it's bloody hard work.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.947
(speaking in native language).

20:14.947 --> 20:16.082
What?

20:16.082 --> 20:19.518
BERRIN: The mule.
GORDON: The mule.
BERRIN: Yes.

20:20.152 --> 20:24.623
KARDA: This way, turn.
BERRIN: Okay this is fine.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.094
GORDON: That's perfect.
BERRIN: Okay.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.863
GORDON: (bleep), (bleep)!

20:30.863 --> 20:33.399
Now come on you
stubborn mule, please!

20:41.373 --> 20:42.842
GORDON: He's allowed
to go to the toilet.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.311
Just as I think I've mastered
the medieval olive press.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.213
(bleep)!

20:47.580 --> 20:50.249
The mule gets a
bout of stage fright.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.184
Come on please.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.854
I'm getting
beaten by a mule here.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.021
Slow him down.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.290
BERRIN: Faster.
GORDON: Slow him down!

20:58.290 --> 21:00.659
BERRIN: It's hard to
tell him to slow down.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.362
GORDON: After crushing
them down, I've now got
to bag them up before we

21:03.362 --> 21:04.730
press the oil out.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.831
Scoop it in?

21:05.831 --> 21:07.133
BERRIN: Yeah.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.534
GORDON: What an
amazing process.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.969
The smell is
incredible, right?

21:09.969 --> 21:11.070
BERRIN: Smells nice huh?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.271
GORDON: I mean talk
about fresh pressed.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.950
GORDON: Oh look, look at that.
BERRIN: Coming out?

21:25.317 --> 21:27.119
GORDON: Yeah, it's
definitely coming out.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.457
GORDON: Mm.
BERRIN: So tasty.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.026
GORDON: Do you have any
bread in your pocket!

21:34.760 --> 21:37.363
Oh my lord.
That is beautiful.

21:37.696 --> 21:41.133
Now I've heard of extra
virgin but this is gonna
be extra, extra virgin.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.235
Look at that shine.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.105
I've never tasted olive
oil straight from the press.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.973
That is amazing.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.910
And it's another lesson
I can take into my
Berber New Year feast,

21:51.210 --> 21:54.146
to produce something
really special for these
hospitable people.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.283
Thank you.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.951
I want to give back,

21:58.951 --> 22:02.655
you know, I want
to show them what I
can do and try to make

22:02.655 --> 22:04.456
this day a day to remember.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.902
With just two days
until I deliver my
New Year Berber banquet,

22:16.902 --> 22:21.974
the pressure is really on and
I can't afford to come up
short in front of Chef Najat.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.646
So I'm heading back to Fes
in search of a special dish.

22:29.715 --> 22:33.219
At home, we do rib eye
or a fillet steak for a
special occasion,

22:33.219 --> 22:37.089
but here in Morocco Najat
tells me there's a much
more revered meat.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.393
Jamal, have you
ever eaten camel?

22:48.767 --> 22:51.070
GORDON: I've enlisted the
help of Jamal, a local guide,

22:51.070 --> 22:53.706
to take me to the only
camel butcher in the Media.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.742
Bonjour. Omar.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.782
You are the only camel
butcher in the Medina right?

23:03.782 --> 23:05.251
JAMAL: Yeah,
he's the only one.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.019
GORDON: What's so
special about camel meat?

23:08.287 --> 23:10.189
GORDON: Like beef?
JAMAL: Yeah.
GORDON: As good as beef?

23:10.189 --> 23:14.093
(speaking in native language).

23:14.426 --> 23:16.061
JAMAL: Camel much
better than beef.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.329
GORDON: Camel's
better than beef?

23:17.329 --> 23:19.031
JAMAL: Yeah, the taste
and actually the benefits.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.333
GORDON: Wow.
What is that?

23:21.967 --> 23:23.502
(speaking in native language).

23:23.502 --> 23:25.137
JAMAL: The hump.
GORDON: The hump.
The camel hump.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.572
JAMAL: Yeah.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.073
GORDON: But it
looks like just fat.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.242
JAMAL: But actually,
I'd say no it's quite
different from the cow fat.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.244
It gives smoke, it
gives taste, flavor.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.580
GORDON: Right.
JAMAL: Amazing yeah.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.548
GORDON: How long
ago was he beheaded?

23:37.149 --> 23:41.053
JAMAL: Four days ago now.
GORDON: Four days ago.

23:41.053 --> 23:44.823
We would never be able to
get a camel's butcher shop
like this in the

23:44.823 --> 23:46.725
East End of London, we
wouldn't be allowed this.

23:47.459 --> 23:49.728
I would love to
taste some camel.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.401
JAMAL: He's inviting you
to tonight for a dinner.

23:55.401 --> 23:59.004
He's gonna make a specialty,
a Tangier with camel.

23:59.805 --> 24:02.908
OMAR: Tangier camel, yes, yes.
GORDON: That sounds amazing.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.576
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you Omar.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.246
OMAR: À bientôt.
GORDON: How exciting is that.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.882
This is gonna be the first
time I've ever eaten camel.

24:11.517 --> 24:14.119
There's not many things
I haven't eaten but
camel is one of them.

24:14.753 --> 24:18.724
So, I can't wait to take up
Omar's offer of a slap up
Tangier dinner tonight.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.832
It must have been amazing
for you growing up in here.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.667
JAMAL: Yeah, yeah.
GORDON: Bonsoir, mon ami.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.802
OMAR: Bonjour. Ça va.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.438
GORDON: Let's go, please.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.007
How big is this restaurant?

24:35.007 --> 24:37.009
(speaking in native language).

24:37.910 --> 24:40.713
What?
What are we doing in here?

24:41.847 --> 24:43.716
This is the weirdest
restaurant I've ever seen.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.217
Are you crazy?

24:45.217 --> 24:47.286
Look at that oven!

24:47.286 --> 24:48.420
Whoa man.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.455
Bonsoir.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.923
(speaking in native language).

24:50.923 --> 24:52.291
Is this your head chef?

24:52.291 --> 24:54.259
OMAR: Yes chef, new chef.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.562
GORDON: What is
he doing in there?

24:56.895 --> 24:58.998
(bleep), Jamal
what's going on?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.967
JAMAL: Actually, he's
keeping the fire, you know,
on, and this is the oven

25:01.967 --> 25:03.202
of the Hammam.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.503
To heat up the rooms.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.804
GORDON: He's boiling water?

25:05.804 --> 25:07.473
JAMAL: Yeah.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.442
GORDON: It turns out I've
been brought to the basement
of a public bathing house,

25:10.776 --> 25:13.445
called a Hammam, and so far,
not a camel in sight.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.484
GORDON: Wow.

25:18.484 --> 25:21.387
Morocco's public bathing
houses originated with the
Ottomans in the 12th century,

25:21.754 --> 25:24.456
which also feels like the
last time I ate anything.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.793
Omar, dinner?

25:27.793 --> 25:29.895
(speaking in native language).

25:30.262 --> 25:32.231
JAMAL: This is the
dinner, Tangier.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.399
GORDON: And what's in there?

25:33.399 --> 25:36.168
JAMAL: Camel meat with
some spices, with onions.

25:36.168 --> 25:39.671
GORDON: The Berber's have used
Tangier clay pots to cook
since before Roman times.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.743
Traditionally the
workers of the Medina
leave their Tangiers here to

25:44.743 --> 25:47.846
slow cook and kill time by
taking a bath upstairs.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.488
GORDON: I do, I do.
Never had one.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.524
JAMAL: It's gonna be fun.
You're gonna like it.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.092
GORDON: Merci. Be careful.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.461
Don't get shriveled
too much in there.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.730
Watch that beard.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.465
This camel better be good.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.533
Honestly.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.568
JAMAL: Come and
have a good bath.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.771
GORDON: You said
we're coming for
dinner and now look at us.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.407
Stark (bleep) naked.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.447
Tell him to go easy on me.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.282
(bleep) sake.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.185
The last person to
bath me was my mum.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.324
(bleep) I'm not that supple.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.762
There's nothing like
a delicate massage
and this is nothing like

26:36.762 --> 26:38.797
a delicate massage.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.800
Do you know I'm not
training (bleep) Olympics.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.407
Jamal?

26:48.407 --> 26:49.908
JAMAL: Yeah.

26:49.908 --> 26:53.045
GORDON:
I am enjoying it okay,
this is, this is beautiful.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.013
JAMAL: I told you.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.783
GORDON: But surely that
Tangier must be ready by now.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.018
(speaking in native language).

27:00.018 --> 27:01.320
JAMAL: It should
be ready by now.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.721
GORDON: It should
be ready by now.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.956
JAMAL: Yes.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.524
GORDON: Is there
somewhere I can dry my hair?

27:05.524 --> 27:06.892
Do you have a
hairdryer in here?

27:06.892 --> 27:08.827
My mum always told me to
wash my hands before dinner,

27:08.827 --> 27:10.562
but that was something else.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.331
I feel cleansed,
I feel refreshed,

27:12.331 --> 27:15.334
but most of all I feel
absolutely bloody starving.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.402
Time for some camel.

27:19.404 --> 27:23.809
Mm, see that, that
smells delicious.

27:25.444 --> 27:30.015
That looks incredible.

27:30.983 --> 27:35.087
Now just the way it
dropped onto the plate.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.221
JAMAL: Yeah.

27:36.221 --> 27:38.524
GORDON: It
bounced, it's so tender.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.559
That is incredible.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.435
Mmm.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.742
GORDON: It's so delicious.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.378
Really nice and spicy,
fragrant coating on the meat.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.447
The big surprise
for me is how deep the
richness of that meat is.

28:02.447 --> 28:04.683
That's the spice
and the citrus.

28:05.117 --> 28:09.054
Omar's combined chunks of
the camel's shoulder with
tail and fat from the hump.

28:10.455 --> 28:11.857
What vegetables are in there?

28:16.228 --> 28:18.730
GORDON: Yes.
JAMAL: The Tangier is healthy.
GORDON: Healthy.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.098
JAMAL: Yeah.
OMAR: Yes.

28:20.098 --> 28:23.135
JAMAL: You may get a little
bit hot or horny after that.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.536
GORDON: Eating
camel makes you horny?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.471
JAMAL: Yeah.
GORDON: Omar come on.

28:26.471 --> 28:28.006
(speaking in native language).

28:28.006 --> 28:30.409
JAMAL: Yeah like a stallion.
GORDON: Like a stallion!

28:36.348 --> 28:38.116
That camel looked
like a one‐pot wonder.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.385
But that was way better
than any stew my mum's cooked,

28:40.385 --> 28:41.653
let me tell you that.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.121
That meat is so tender.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.524
Right now I don't know
what's more tender,
my back or the meat.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.293
Delicious, really good.

28:48.293 --> 28:49.595
Merci beaucoup.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.530
JAMAL: Thank you.
GORDON: Take care.

28:56.902 --> 29:01.173
The slow, and I really do
mean slow, cooked camel
meat is a revelation.

29:02.107 --> 29:04.810
It's definitely gonna be part
of my New Year Berber feast.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.812
OMAR: Tangier!

29:06.812 --> 29:09.715
GORDON: So, Omar's invited
me to his farm to collect
the meat before I head

29:09.715 --> 29:11.950
back up into the mountains.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.485
Man. Wow!

29:13.485 --> 29:17.189
What an amazing
herd of camels.

29:18.690 --> 29:22.261
All these camels are reared
purely for meat, for eating?

29:22.794 --> 29:24.596
(speaking in native language).

29:25.030 --> 29:27.432
JAMAL: No meat and milk.
GORDON: So, meat and dairy.

29:27.432 --> 29:31.403
JAMAL: Yeah.
Okay, you're gonna milk it.

29:32.237 --> 29:33.939
GORDON: I'm gonna milk it?
JAMAL: Yeah.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.775
GORDON: I've
never milked a camel.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.610
Where's the teat?

29:39.811 --> 29:41.380
OMAR: You'll have to
show me where, where?

29:41.380 --> 29:44.683
JAMAL: It's a male!

29:45.350 --> 29:46.551
GORDON: Oh it's a male.

29:46.551 --> 29:47.853
(bleep).

29:47.853 --> 29:49.821
We're not
milking that one obviously.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.456
Come on, seriously!

29:51.456 --> 29:53.425
I'll get you back later.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.530
After a quick masterclass
from Omar, it's time to
milk my first camel.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.967
Hopefully my hands
aren't too cold.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.437
Ooh (bleep).

30:11.910 --> 30:15.981
♪ ♪

30:16.848 --> 30:19.851
GORDON: Man,
they're strong no?

30:20.986 --> 30:24.389
I have two jobs today,
getting milk from a camel
and not getting kicked in the

30:24.389 --> 30:26.191
face by a camel.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.694
Oh that's it.

30:29.027 --> 30:31.396
(speaking in native language).

30:33.865 --> 30:36.802
So it looks like a
cappuccino in there.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.510
Mm. It's rich huh?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.079
JAMAL: Yeah.
GORDON: Creamy.
JAMAL: Yeah.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.947
GORDON: It's boiling,
it's so hot.

30:48.947 --> 30:51.416
JAMAL: Yeah, it's come in
directly from the teat.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.320
GORDON: It's delicious,
really delicious.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.922
JAMAL: Yeah.

30:56.922 --> 30:58.623
GORDON: I thought it was
gonna be a little bit sweet
but it's not that sweet,

30:58.623 --> 31:00.525
but it's creamy,
it's very rich.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.593
That was insane.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.262
I mean what buggers,
took me to a male camel.

31:04.262 --> 31:06.665
I'm looking thinking (bleep)
how do you milk this thing?

31:15.340 --> 31:17.509
With camel meat for the
New Year's feast secured,

31:17.509 --> 31:19.878
I'm back on the road
heading deep into the
mid Atlas Mountains.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.816
But I'm still on the look
out for more ingredients.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.654
Throughout my journey I've
noticed kids selling heart
of palm on the roadside,

31:30.822 --> 31:33.825
but Najat has tipped me
off about which area has
the best ones.

31:35.193 --> 31:36.228
Bonjour.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.730
How are you?
We good?

31:39.931 --> 31:42.267
Can I have a
little taste please?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.842
It's almost like a
sort of sweet cucumber.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.411
That is delicious.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.745
And are there lots more?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.380
MUHAMMED: Oh there's a
lot more up there right.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.083
GORDON: How far off?
MUHAMMED: Like ten minutes.
GORDON: I need about six more.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.351
MUHAMMED: We can
do that, yeah.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.685
GORDON: Let's go.
MUHAMMED: Let's do it.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.120
GORDON: Let's go,
let's go, thank you.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.555
So ten minutes up.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.924
MUHAMMED: Ten minutes.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.593
GORDON: Those fresh
hearts of palm taste so good.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.796
They're worth
climbing a mountain for.

32:12.831 --> 32:15.233
It's a very, very,
very long ten minutes.

32:15.233 --> 32:16.435
Are you sure?

32:16.435 --> 32:19.304
But that's if we make it
before I reach retirement age.

32:19.304 --> 32:20.605
They'd better taste good.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.807
Oh my god.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.508
MUHAMMED: They will.

32:25.577 --> 32:26.778
GORDON: Gentlemen slow down.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.316
MUHAMMED: Gordon!
GORDON: Come on.

32:31.316 --> 32:32.684
(speaking in native language).

32:32.684 --> 32:34.085
Come on.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.887
Look at these boys, they're
as fit as a mountain goat.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.322
Look at the speed
they get up there.

32:37.322 --> 32:39.090
MUHAMMED: Yeah.
GORDON: Wait for grandad.

32:40.091 --> 32:41.827
MUHAMMED: There we are,
this is the best place.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.895
GORDON: Finally.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.465
MUHAMMED: Can you
see the technique?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.600
GORDON: Yeah I'm
watching the technique.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.670
The trick is to cut the
palm as close to the
ground as possible to get

32:51.670 --> 32:53.171
to the juiciest part.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.741
Stand back please.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.948
It also helps if
you've seen <i>The Shining.</i>

33:04.850 --> 33:06.918
When was the last
time this was sharpened?

33:09.354 --> 33:10.789
(speaking in native language).

33:10.789 --> 33:12.657
GORDON: (bleep)!

33:17.262 --> 33:20.232
(bleep), (bleep)!

33:20.232 --> 33:21.666
MUHAMMED: You didn't
cut it correctly.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.735
GORDON: No. (bleep)!

33:24.536 --> 33:26.905
MUHAMMED: The best
part of it stays in
the hole, to the ground.

33:27.272 --> 33:28.807
GORDON: Inside.
MUHAMMED: Yeah inside.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.308
GORDON: So I've got the
top but not the heart.

33:30.308 --> 33:31.676
Okay, right this one.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.879
Second time.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.650
MUHAMMED: It's almost there.
There you go.

33:39.551 --> 33:43.622
GORDON: Finally.
MUHAMMED: There you go.
GORDON: Merci.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.026
Look at that.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.362
MUHAMMED: You can try it.
GORDON: That's so fresh.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.863
Delicious.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.700
It's almost like a
raw artichoke but sweeter
than an artichoke so I've

33:55.700 --> 33:57.435
seen the majority of these
come out of a can.

33:57.435 --> 34:01.373
To actually cut them
down fresh, yeah that's
freshness on a different level.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.275
High five.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.609
MUHAMMED: There we are.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.077
GORDON: Up. Good job.
MUHAMMED: High five.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.747
GORDON: Good job.
Najat's tip off has delivered.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.982
These are
definitely going on my menu.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.525
The day has finally arrived.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.461
The villagers are
getting ready to
celebrate the Berber New Year.

34:25.397 --> 34:29.167
Today's my final day in
Morocco and I'm cooking for
Karda and his Berber family.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.836
It's a big celebration,

34:31.836 --> 34:34.706
it's New Year's Day
so one of the most
important days across

34:34.706 --> 34:36.474
their calendar.

34:36.474 --> 34:40.011
I'm going head to head
with Najat Kaanache, one
of Morocco's finest chefs.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.414
Najat.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.149
NAJAT: Hey.
GORDON: We're good?
NAJAT: How are you doing?

34:44.149 --> 34:45.717
GORDON: What a week.
NAJAT: How was everything?
GORDON: Crazy.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.053
Let me help you
sort that wood.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.357
Last time I saw her I
realized I screwed up
by not giving her a job.

34:53.758 --> 34:54.926
Now did you miss me?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.628
NAJAT: No.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.863
GORDON: And the next
thing I knew I was
rappelling down a waterfall.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.900
But I'm sure that that
was just a coincidence.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.035
Now Omar, my camel man,

35:04.035 --> 35:08.306
I was supposed to
go for dinner, had a
hammam instead and then

35:08.306 --> 35:10.375
whilst I was getting
washed and dressed.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.910
NAJAT: I don't want
to know, thank you.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.845
GORDON: But (inaudible).
NAJAT: Good, yeah.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.514
GORDON: Hang on, I think
it's best I just hurry
up and tell her what

35:16.514 --> 35:18.483
I'm gonna cook, camel.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.086
That's gonna be
one big main course.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.153
NAJAT: With all this?

35:22.153 --> 35:23.555
GORDON: Ras el hanout.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.757
Paprika, the
maze, salt, pepper.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.092
I mean beautiful.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.461
NAJAT: Amazing.
Let me show you what I've got.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.597
GORDON: Surprise, surprise.
Najat is also using camel.

35:32.597 --> 35:33.965
That's the leg.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.934
NAJAT: Yes.
GORDON: Amazing.
NAJAT: This?

35:35.934 --> 35:38.036
GORDON: That's the hump.
NAJAT: The hump.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.304
GORDON: Yeah.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.439
NAJAT: Which we're
gonna use to braise
this a little bit,

35:41.439 --> 35:42.907
to give a little color.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.342
GORDON: Beautiful.

35:44.342 --> 35:47.178
NAJAT: Now we should
not talk anymore and
we should just go and cook

35:47.178 --> 35:49.080
because we have
a this New Year,

35:49.080 --> 35:51.416
Berber New Year that
you have to surprise us.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.018
GORDON: Yes.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.686
I'm going to try and surprise
you but I want to learn.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.021
NAJAT: We can talk.

35:56.021 --> 35:57.288
Come around.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.823
GORDON: If I fall
behind, help me. Please.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.991
NAJAT: Yes, we will
help you, no worries.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.059
GORDON: Yes?

36:01.059 --> 36:02.360
NAJAT: We're many
of us, we do it.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.461
GORDON: Okay good luck.

36:03.461 --> 36:04.763
NAJAT: Yes thank
you very much.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.097
GORDON: Let's go.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.700
I might be a Michelin
Star chef but here that
counts for nothing.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.403
Najat's been cooking
authentic Moroccan
cuisine all her life.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.606
I just hope I can live
up to her standards.

36:19.077 --> 36:21.112
My days eating Moroccan food
in restaurants in London,

36:21.112 --> 36:22.881
trust me, are miles away

36:22.881 --> 36:26.351
from preparing and
cooking food here in
the Atlas Mountains.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.524
Now the dice is a little
bit smaller than Omar
showed me because I haven't

36:32.524 --> 36:35.160
got eight hours and time
for hammam this afternoon.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.595
(bleep)

36:38.263 --> 36:44.035
I'm using the camel
shoulder and the cheek,
gonna mix them together,

36:45.503 --> 36:48.740
almost like an
oxtail and a shin.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.408
You okay?

36:50.408 --> 36:52.277
NAJAT: Super okay, thank you.

36:52.277 --> 36:57.515
GORDON: About ten years
ago Najat sent several
letters as a job application

36:58.349 --> 36:59.818
to come and work for me.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.287
I didn't get to see
those and she never
made it through the door.

37:02.287 --> 37:04.856
I think she's using this
moment to get her own back.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.092
Najat.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.193
NAJAT: Yeah.

37:08.193 --> 37:09.494
GORDON: Do you have a
knife sharpener please?

37:09.494 --> 37:11.196
NAJAT: No.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.499
GORDON: We're
supposed to be friends.

37:14.499 --> 37:15.834
(bleep)

37:23.341 --> 37:24.542
GORDON: Najat.
NAJAT: Yeah?

37:24.542 --> 37:26.077
GORDON: You okay?
Need some help?

37:26.077 --> 37:28.213
NAJAT: I'm in my
territory my friend.

37:28.213 --> 37:31.182
GORDON: I know, I know
it's your territory.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.420
I'm going head to head
against one of
Morocco's finest chefs,

37:35.420 --> 37:36.921
Najat Kaanache.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.758
Under pressure to
deliver a feast worthy
of a Berber New Year.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.464
FATIMA: Chef Gordon.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.333
(speaking in native language).

37:48.333 --> 37:50.068
GORDON: Happy New Year.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.172
Damn, the guests are here
and I am running behind.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.610
Right now, I feel like
a fish out of water.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.512
Najat's good, she's
not giving much away.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.581
She's a proper chef;
close guarded,
don't ask me for help.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.451
That's how feisty she is.

38:08.853 --> 38:12.190
I've never ever cooked with
olive oil that I've pressed
literally 100 meters away.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.494
You can smell it, it is
absolutely incredible.

38:17.495 --> 38:18.663
Meat in.

38:18.663 --> 38:21.166
My main dish is a slow cooked
camel tangier,

38:21.166 --> 38:23.668
inspired by the one I
tasted with Omar in Fes.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.006
You can smell that, that
fragrance is just incredible.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.542
Lemons in.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.978
I want the lemons to sort of
disintegrate so it gives that
really nice acidic flavor.

38:36.414 --> 38:39.984
The chick peas
will release starch
and literally allow this

38:39.984 --> 38:42.387
thing to thicken up naturally.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.355
It's gonna take
about 90 minutes.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.657
Beautiful.

38:46.191 --> 38:48.893
NAJAT: Oh my god!
I smell some deliciousness.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.563
GORDON: Najat.
NAJAT: What's happening here?

38:51.563 --> 38:54.299
GORDON: I'm using some
of the shoulder, the jowl.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.634
NAJAT: Sounds very nice,
yes the cheek.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.937
GORDON: Ras el hanout.
NAJAT: Ras el hanout.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.339
GORDON: That's my tangier.
NAJAT: It's amazing.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.341
Welcome to Morocco.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.609
GORDON: Thank you.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.144
NAJAT: So maybe you
can move this one
and put this one there.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.712
GORDON: Yeah I'm
gonna start cooking on
there again in a minute.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.514
NAJAT: Oh okay.
GORDON: But thank you chef.

39:09.514 --> 39:13.484
You said get into the
mountains and understand,
I'm still learning, okay.

39:14.285 --> 39:15.653
NAJAT: No problem.
GORDON: Forgive me.

39:15.653 --> 39:16.955
NAJAT: Fine.

39:16.955 --> 39:20.525
GORDON: Remember,
the proof is at the end,
in the flavor, right?

39:21.926 --> 39:25.496
Next on my menu is a chicken
rfissa, a classic Berber
dish traditionally

39:26.164 --> 39:27.732
served for celebrations.

39:28.666 --> 39:32.337
It's the baby chickens
with the most amazing spice.

39:32.337 --> 39:35.607
The idea is to coat those
chickens in all of this.

39:37.575 --> 39:40.144
(rooster crows)

39:40.144 --> 39:41.546
Please be quiet.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.514
Guess what's happened,
that's what's gonna
happen to you next.

39:43.514 --> 39:45.149
Come on.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.959
GORDON: Yes, but did
you rappel down a waterfall
with your hands to get them?

39:55.627 --> 39:57.562
I don't think so.

39:58.196 --> 40:03.401
Now, peas in, to the
amazing chicken and then look,

40:04.702 --> 40:07.038
these amazing morel mushrooms.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.742
That's gonna elevate
that chicken dish into
something absolutely stunning.

40:11.376 --> 40:14.145
With my chicken rfissa
and tangier slow cooking,
it's on to my side dish,

40:14.846 --> 40:16.581
caramelized carrots.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.250
But I'm missing one
vital ingredient.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.587
Fatima, do you have
any honey for my carrots?

40:23.788 --> 40:25.056
FATIMA: Yeah.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.524
GORDON: Yes? Thank you.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.193
Thank goodness for my
nine‐year‐old sous chef.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.862
Whereabouts?

40:31.296 --> 40:34.666
Karda's daughter,
Fatima, says her grandma
may be able to help.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.068
Probably got no
idea what I'm saying.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.237
It'll all make sense
when you taste my carrots.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.874
It's a Berber New Year
tradition, to exchange
food with your neighbors,

40:43.641 --> 40:46.678
although not to bring a
pasty British chef to
your grandma's house.

40:47.512 --> 40:50.515
Fingers crossed, I
can swap some heart of
palm for her local honey.

40:51.883 --> 40:52.951
Bonjour madame.

40:57.221 --> 41:00.692
GORDON: Merci. Wow.
Looks amazing. Ah!

41:03.328 --> 41:05.797
GORDON: All of this?
Wow, Happy New Year.

41:06.998 --> 41:10.134
Oh gift, gift, and
Madame some hearts of palm.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.803
(speaking in native language).

41:11.803 --> 41:13.571
Yes, thank you so much.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.073
Happy New Year.

41:16.507 --> 41:18.776
Caramelized carrots
with Grandma's honey.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.779
How good is that?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.915
Mm, it's good.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.319
(bleep), (bleep)!

41:29.787 --> 41:32.323
That should keep them quiet.

41:37.261 --> 41:40.098
Annoyingly, Najat
plates up first.

41:40.098 --> 41:43.534
She's serving
braised camel and a
chicken stew alongside some

41:43.534 --> 41:45.336
delicious sautéed mushrooms.

41:47.905 --> 41:52.744
I'm serving my chicken
rfissa on a bed of warka
pastry that I learned how to

41:52.744 --> 41:54.812
make with Najat in
the Medina in Fes.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.750
Look at that, my god.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.318
Beautiful.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.620
It smells incredible.

42:02.620 --> 42:05.523
And the piece de
resistance, my camel tangier.

42:06.257 --> 42:09.260
The one that I'm
most excited for.

42:09.660 --> 42:11.396
Really beautiful.

42:11.396 --> 42:13.131
With hungry guests waiting,

42:13.131 --> 42:16.034
I've just got time to
put the finishing
touches to my final side dish,

42:16.834 --> 42:19.270
freshly picked heart of
palm and a goat's cheese dip.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.307
Najat you ready?

42:23.674 --> 42:26.010
A week isn't long enough to
understand that Berber magic.

42:26.010 --> 42:32.250
Now I don't want egg on my
face but right now I could be
a little bit out of my league.

42:36.120 --> 42:40.558
I just hope I've shown Najat
that I've come to grips with
the secrets of Berber cuisine.

42:40.858 --> 42:42.060
Bonjour.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.327
(speaking in native language).

42:43.327 --> 42:44.529
Bonjour, bonjour.

42:49.133 --> 42:51.402
GORDON: And
finally, the chicken.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.237
Please enjoy.
Bon appetite.
Happy New Year.

42:54.205 --> 42:56.107
NAJAT: Happy New Year.
GORDON: Happy New Year.

43:06.184 --> 43:07.618
GORDON: Mushroom man,
nice to see you.

43:07.618 --> 43:09.253
ABDULLAH: Mushroom.
GORDON: Bonjour Abdullah.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.955
ABDULLAH: It's very wonderful.

43:10.955 --> 43:13.091
GORDON: That was
very wonderful, yeah.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.894
What an amazing day and
what an amazing cook because

43:16.894 --> 43:20.164
a New Year's
celebration is a feast,

43:21.065 --> 43:23.468
more importantly it
brings the community and
the families together.

43:23.468 --> 43:28.072
A little bit nervous to
begin with because you need
to respect their culture and

43:28.639 --> 43:31.142
not cook out of their zone.

43:31.142 --> 43:33.845
I've gone to hell and
back to get those ingredients
and it's just so nice to

43:33.845 --> 43:35.680
see everybody happy.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.815
Excellent.

43:39.784 --> 43:42.153
Now it's the moment of truth.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.489
Have I managed to
cook like a Berber?

43:47.024 --> 43:48.726
How was it?

43:50.828 --> 43:53.030
Which camel dish
did you prefer?

43:53.030 --> 43:55.299
This one or that
one over there?

43:57.668 --> 43:59.737
(speaking in native language).

44:00.338 --> 44:02.340
KARDA: They
prefer this one more.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.775
GORDON: Damn,
Najat's got the upper hand.

44:04.775 --> 44:07.211
What is it that's given
her dish the edge over mine?

44:08.279 --> 44:10.414
Did you cook yours
with a different stock?

44:10.414 --> 44:11.949
NAJAT: No, same one.

44:11.949 --> 44:13.317
GORDON: No?
Did you cut it smaller?

44:13.317 --> 44:16.187
NAJAT: Just cumin,
pepper and ginger.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.588
GORDON: Cumin,
pepper and ginger.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.357
NAJAT: Skin of orange, lemon.

44:19.357 --> 44:21.192
GORDON: Ah, okay,
I love that idea.

44:22.426 --> 44:24.262
NAJAT: Any other dish?

44:24.829 --> 44:26.931
(speaking in native language).

44:26.931 --> 44:29.967
BERRIN: He's saying
this one was perfect.

44:29.967 --> 44:31.202
GORDON: Oh good.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.137
At least my chicken was a hit.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.573
Now I need my sous
chef to weigh in.

44:35.573 --> 44:37.575
Fatima, which camel
dish do you prefer?

44:38.910 --> 44:40.211
(speaking in native language).

44:40.211 --> 44:41.612
NAJAT: Ah!

44:41.612 --> 44:44.515
GORDON: I love you.
NAJAT: She likes Mr. Gordon!

44:44.515 --> 44:46.117
GORDON: Thank you all.

44:46.117 --> 44:49.153
I've learned a lot
because I've never used camel.

44:49.153 --> 44:51.656
It's something that we've
never eaten in England.

44:51.656 --> 44:56.861
You've really given me an
insight to an amazing way of
how to eat and cook.

44:57.595 --> 44:59.397
NAJAT: Thank you very
much for being here.

44:59.397 --> 45:02.900
GORDON: Amazing.
Happy New Year!

45:04.936 --> 45:07.605
NAJAT: Happy New Year.
GORDON: Thank you everybody.
Amazing.

45:09.674 --> 45:12.043
It was great to see
everyone enjoy our meal.

45:12.043 --> 45:15.413
And while I may not have
got every vote, I got
the one that mattered.

45:16.414 --> 45:18.950
NAJAT: He did amazing.
I liked it very much.

45:18.950 --> 45:22.887
His energy is awesome,
he understood the whole
cultural process.

45:24.322 --> 45:27.425
He has a great spirit and
he's Gordon Ramsay,

45:28.092 --> 45:32.096
he's the person that we
all seen with a great soul.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.565
GORDON: Good job.
Good job.

45:34.565 --> 45:37.034
Boom, Boom, Thank you.

45:39.470 --> 45:42.006
What an amazing week and I've
fallen in love with Morocco.

45:42.006 --> 45:44.976
I've really understood
that Berber culture.

45:45.643 --> 45:48.546
I've been humbled by
these people's
incredible hospitality.

45:49.213 --> 45:53.217
I've learned techniques
that go back centuries
and I've been reminded,

45:53.217 --> 45:56.487
you don't need a fancy
kitchen to produce truly
outstanding cuisine.

45:59.390 --> 46:03.060
To see them happy,
they start their year
off with a great feast,

46:03.728 --> 46:05.463
for any chef,
anywhere in the world,

46:05.463 --> 46:09.467
that is a meal that
ends as a dream come true.

46:09.967 --> 46:13.037
Now onto my next adventure.

46:15.806 --> 46:17.308
