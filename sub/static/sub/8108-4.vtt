see them anywhere?

Why don't we go back to their house,
wait for them there?

00:09.844 --> 00:12.430
Yeah, because they'll
probably answer the door

00:12.555 --> 00:14.307
the 16th time I knock.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.609
There they are.

Hi. I'm sorry
I followed you here.

I just really wish you could give me
a few minutes of your time.

to make it an open adoption,

maybe you never had a choice.

How do I pray?

01:34.387 --> 01:36.723
You make a wish
and lift the Buddha.

01:41.770 --> 01:45.315
I wish they could understand
how badly I need this.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.578
Now make the wish again.

Came up with a doozy.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.811
Your mother called.
Twice.

03:04.936 --> 03:08.231
But she's still healthy. This
25-year-old woman, on the other hand...

03:08.356 --> 03:10.149
Her messages sounded
kind of urgent.

03:10.275 --> 03:13.987
Well, that's the way women sound
when their spouse of 50 years dies.

03:17.866 --> 03:19.909
Your dad died? Are you...

03:20.034 --> 03:22.579
Yep, fine.
Our patient,

03:22.704 --> 03:25.582
who's been known to take
a few drinks on non-occasions,

03:25.707 --> 03:28.751
vomits blood and collapses
on a trip to China.

03:28.877 --> 03:31.254
Chinese surgeons cut
out a foot of bowel,

03:31.379 --> 03:33.256
but the pain is worse
now than it was before.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.049
House, call your mom.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.593
What are you, my mom?

03:37.218 --> 03:39.637
We can continue
this differential in five minutes.

03:39.762 --> 03:43.391
Are those bags under your eyes?
You were up all night.

03:43.516 --> 03:44.642
You told her, didn't you?

03:44.767 --> 03:49.397
I don't know what your daddy issues are,
but don't deflect them on me.

03:49.522 --> 03:51.566
Told his wife
he's been getting some strange.

03:51.691 --> 03:54.027
She kicked
his adulterous tuchus to the curb.

03:54.152 --> 03:55.111
Seriously? You told her?

03:55.236 --> 03:56.613
Yes, I told her,

03:56.738 --> 03:58.406
but, no, she did not
kick me to the curb.

We stayed up late talking.
We're going to continue talking.

Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right?
Get it translated.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.922
What about Meckel's diverticulum?

04:14.047 --> 04:15.924
If the surgeons didn't remove
the diverticulum,

04:16.049 --> 04:17.884
it could cause pain, bleeding.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.802
Too high up for
a colonoscopy.

04:19.928 --> 04:22.597
CT could miss it.
Ultrasound's fastest.

04:22.722 --> 04:24.349
And since I'm the fastest
with the ultrasound...

04:24.474 --> 04:26.851

Let me do the ultrasound.

with your dad and stop...

04:46.788 --> 04:49.123
I was there to track down
my biological parents.

to the stream where it was born.

04:52.627 --> 04:55.129

I'm a technician

05:20.989 --> 05:22.407
You went through
my apartment?

05:22.532 --> 05:25.743
We found alcohol.
We thought you'd quit.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.912
- Did her drinking cause this?
- No.

05:30.123 --> 05:31.457
Can you tell her it did?

05:39.757 --> 05:41.259
HOUSE: Licorice root.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.762
No, thanks, I'm good.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.682
I threw it to you
for a reason.

05:47.807 --> 05:51.477
It's what the Chinese doctors gave her.
It contains glycyrrhizin.

05:51.602 --> 05:54.313
They were treating her for SARS?

05:54.439 --> 05:58.735
Not very effectively.
But SARS explains the cough,

05:58.860 --> 06:02.238
causes hypoperfusion, which explains
the ischemic bowel. It's perfect.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.115
Lung involvement
isn't very severe.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.993
Okay, well,
so call it ARS.

you're sick with grief,

07:21.859 --> 07:23.069

to be there.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.606
Plus schistocytes on her smear
means it's DIC,

16:20.731 --> 16:21.649

she's got cancer.

Whatever House says or doesn't say,
I'm sure the guy's a mess.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.345

He was still your father.

You're biologically programmed
to have feelings for him.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.433

17:00.270 --> 17:02.398

17:02.523 --> 17:04.608
He's not my
biological father.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.823
I figured it out
when I was 12.

17:10.948 --> 17:14.076
Of course. You're a brilliant,
socially-isolated 12-year-old,

17:14.201 --> 17:15.911

This is sad. You don't believe
your mother screwed around.

I have a distinctive
red birthmark on my scalp

17:39.810 --> 17:42.229

friend of the family.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.733
If you believed this story, you wouldn't
be telling me about his birthmarks,

about the genetic testing you had done.

to me about getting the charges dropped.

24:53.618 --> 24:56.246
I got a lawyer, he cut a deal.
You didn't call the guy?

24:56.371 --> 24:58.915
You have to show up at the arraignment.
Everybody knows that.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.793
Everybody
with your misdemeanor experience.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.753
You can go.

25:03.879 --> 25:04.963
What?

25:05.088 --> 25:07.757
He's a fugitive
from justice.

25:07.883 --> 25:10.302
That whole story was lies.
He stabbed a man.

25:10.427 --> 25:14.014
Louisiana doesn't want to pay
to get you back.

25:14.139 --> 25:17.142
Forget Louisiana.
He was driving recklessly

25:17.267 --> 25:19.311
through your comatose village.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.646
What, do they put lead
in the jelly donuts here?

25:21.771 --> 25:23.565
Stop acting
like such an ingrate

25:23.690 --> 25:26.109
and go pay your respects
to your father.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.530
CT confirmed gallstones.

25:30.947 --> 25:35.035
Normally not dangerous, almost everyone
has them, but sometimes...

25:35.160 --> 25:36.328
They kill you?

25:36.453 --> 25:39.039
Yup.
Unless I take them out.

25:39.164 --> 25:40.665
We do it laparoscopically.

25:42.626 --> 25:43.835
Um...

25:46.504 --> 25:48.381
How long has her urine
been brown?

25:48.506 --> 25:50.383
Kidneys were fine
this afternoon.

25:50.508 --> 25:51.843
CHASE: They're not now.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.305
It's not the gallstones.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.602
HOUSE: Well, of course
it's not gallstones.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.978
Who thought
it was gallstones?

26:02.103 --> 26:03.188
You said "steamroller."

26:03.313 --> 26:05.190
I also said
"construction site."

26:05.315 --> 26:07.943
Gallstones could cause
a pancreatic cyst.

26:08.068 --> 26:11.154
Just turn around.
The thing is two hours over already,

26:11.279 --> 26:13.156
and that's the third time
we've passed that colonial

26:13.281 --> 26:15.325
with the cross
burning out front.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.785
I'm not lost.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.412
I'm not talking about
what caused the cyst.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.289
I'm talking about
what the cyst caused.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.249
<i>Everything-</i>

26:22.374 --> 26:24.209
Cysts are symptoms,
not diagnoses.

26:24.334 --> 26:27.921
Unless it's a multiple cyst
with connections to other organs.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.256
Like a steamroller.

26:29.381 --> 26:31.383
That's a long road
down to the kidneys.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.885
How do we prove it?
Won't be visible on a scan,

26:34.010 --> 26:35.512
Chase isn't gonna go
groping around

26:35.637 --> 26:36.680
when she's got
kidney failure.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.889
Bubbles.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.058
- Is that your new stripper name?
- Yes.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.978
And also, we inject bubbles into
the cyst and follow where they drift.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.104
If they end up in her other organs,

26:44.229 --> 26:46.022
we know you're right,
cut it out, she's fine.

26:46.147 --> 26:48.233
Bubbles is right.
Go echo.

26:51.278 --> 26:52.737
I'm not lost.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.836
(NICOLE SHUDDERING)

27:09.629 --> 27:11.423
Nicole, you gotta stay still.

27:11.548 --> 27:12.841
(STAMMERS) I'm nervous.

27:12.966 --> 27:15.844
You're not nervous.
It's the DTs, isn't it?

27:17.470 --> 27:20.473
I haven't had a drink
since I got here.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.895
Good heavens.
We haven't missed it after all.

27:26.021 --> 27:27.939
It's like the end of
<i>A</i> Christmas Carol.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.449
(SIGHS)

27:39.784 --> 27:41.369
I'm so glad you're here.

27:42.954 --> 27:46.791
It's a load off of my mind
just to see you.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.170
Thank you, James.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.047
Mom, how could you
delay the funeral?

27:52.172 --> 27:55.633
Honey, your dad is dead.
He's not going to care.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.510
Do you know what
you're going to say?

27:57.635 --> 27:59.763
I don't know.
Just let the minister,

27:59.888 --> 28:01.556
or one of his buddies
from the Corps...

28:01.681 --> 28:02.849
You're talking.

28:02.974 --> 28:04.976
I don't care
that you didn't like him.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.771
He was your father
and he loved you.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.273
The war is over, Greg.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.735
Please do this for me.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.907
Stop looking so worried.

28:20.075 --> 28:22.702
I know he's gonna
make me proud.

28:22.827 --> 28:25.747
I'm sure you know him better
than I do.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.921
Her liver's been compromised.

28:33.046 --> 28:34.547
And the DTs
will cause her muscles

28:34.672 --> 28:36.966
to continue to twitch,
even under sedation.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.052
We need to paralyze her
to do this procedure.

28:39.177 --> 28:40.678
I wanted to stop.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.806
A phenobarbital coma
will not only allow us

28:42.931 --> 28:45.392
to inject the cyst,
it'll treat the DTs.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.019
When she wakes up,
she won't be in withdrawal.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.772
We've seen her through
withdrawal before.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.941
We've seen her
through everything.

28:53.066 --> 28:56.069
We've been supportive,
we've been combative.

28:56.194 --> 28:58.279
We've picked her up from bars
in the middle of the night,

28:58.405 --> 29:00.740
we've let her spend
the night in jail.

29:03.785 --> 29:08.123
I used to say it would be okay,
that I'd get it together.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.958
I don't say that anymore.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.087
Let's make you healthy.

29:14.212 --> 29:16.297
Then we'll worry about
making you sober.

29:17.841 --> 29:20.593
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.929
I am not talking.

29:23.805 --> 29:27.851
We were strangers.
We shared some geography 30 years ago.

29:27.976 --> 29:30.311
Right.
He had no influence on you at all.

29:30.437 --> 29:32.939
The father who was compulsive
about punctuality.

29:33.064 --> 29:36.609
His issue, which I deliberately
made not my issue.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.445
Thereby making it
your issue.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.655
Compulsively showing up
four hours late,

29:40.780 --> 29:43.533
ignoring discipline,
ignoring rules...

29:43.658 --> 29:45.160
Oh, God. He's here.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.494
Who's here?

29:47.454 --> 29:49.914
The one you're pretending
is your father?

29:51.583 --> 29:54.043
Nice pick,
he looks like Sean Connery.

29:54.169 --> 29:58.423
So, back when you were devising
this fantasy, did you tell your father?

29:58.548 --> 30:00.633
"Dad, I refuse
to recognize your existence

30:00.758 --> 30:04.053
"because I've chosen
James Bond as my dad?"

30:05.680 --> 30:07.265
I used different words.

30:08.558 --> 30:09.392
What?

30:10.602 --> 30:13.104
Hearing your own son
hates you so much

30:13.229 --> 30:15.982
he's replaced you
in his mind?

30:16.733 --> 30:19.110
That's gotta suck.
How did he take it?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.029
I already told you.

30:21.154 --> 30:23.406
He didn't speak to me
for a summer.

30:29.913 --> 30:30.914
(CLEARS THROAT)

30:31.039 --> 30:34.501
It means more to me
than I can say

30:34.626 --> 30:36.336
to have all of you
here today.

30:37.837 --> 30:43.801
And now our son, Gregory,
would like to say a few words.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.098
Greg?

31:07.283 --> 31:09.953
There's a lot of people
here today,

31:10.078 --> 31:12.080
including some from the Corps.

31:13.540 --> 31:15.750
And I notice
that every one of them

31:15.875 --> 31:18.753
is either my father's rank
or higher,

31:19.837 --> 31:22.090
and that doesn't surprise me,

31:23.716 --> 31:29.764
because if the test of a man is
how he treats those he has power over,

31:31.849 --> 31:34.060
it was a test
my father failed.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.899
This man you're eager
to pay homage to,

31:41.025 --> 31:45.405
he was incapable of admitting
any point of view but his own.

31:45.530 --> 31:49.617
He punished failure, and he
did not accept anything less than...

32:01.838 --> 32:03.840
He loved doing what he did.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.011
He saw his work
as some kind of

32:09.178 --> 32:10.888
sacred calling,

32:12.432 --> 32:14.684
more important
than any personal relationship.

32:19.564 --> 32:22.900
Maybe if he'd been a better father,
I'd be a better son.

32:26.237 --> 32:30.158
But I am what I am because of him.
For better or for worse.

32:33.036 --> 32:36.080
And I just...
I just wish...

32:36.205 --> 32:37.832
(CRYING)

33:12.867 --> 33:14.827
(WHISPERS) Put it back.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.287
Well, he's not gonna miss it.

33:16.412 --> 33:19.415
I'm done enabling. You can't even
let them put him in the ground

33:19.540 --> 33:21.584
without making it
serve your agenda.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.753
HOUSE: You really wanna do this
in front of everybody?

33:23.878 --> 33:25.755
You wanna punish me
or them?

33:38.893 --> 33:41.646
How can I still
feel surprise?

33:41.771 --> 33:45.316
You would take even this,
a moment of real human grief,

33:45.441 --> 33:46.693
and turn it into a farce.

33:46.818 --> 33:50.405
Oh, cut the crap.
You enjoy what I do.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.865
I never had to force you,
you like coming along for the ride.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.076
Yes, that's why
I'm cheering you on now.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.413
This is about you needing
to be prepared for the worst.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.415
So you become
an oncologist.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.209
No surprises there,
the worst happens all the time.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.336
But Amber,
she was young and healthy.

34:05.461 --> 34:06.713
Her death came
out of nowhere.

34:06.838 --> 34:08.381
Don't bring Amber
into this.

34:08.506 --> 34:09.841
And you weren't ready.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.801
That makes you angry.
The world sucks,

34:11.926 --> 34:13.469
and you didn't have time
to brace yourself.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.680
What happened out there
is your show.

34:15.805 --> 34:18.224
You're scared to death
of losing anyone that matters,

34:18.349 --> 34:20.184
so you dump the person
who matters the most to you.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.603
I'm not scared to death,
I'm moving forward.

34:22.729 --> 34:25.523
Because no one can take away from you
what you no longer have.

34:25.648 --> 34:26.816
(LAUGHING)

34:26.941 --> 34:28.818
Your father's death
is about you.

34:28.943 --> 34:30.236
Amber's death
is about you.

34:30.361 --> 34:32.321
I can't imagine why someone
wouldn't want to be your friend.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.742
Admit it. You're angry
and you're scared of losing me.

34:35.867 --> 34:38.161
- I'm not angry, I'm not scared.
- Admit it.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.662
- I'm not afraid.
- Admit it!

34:39.787 --> 34:41.956
- I've lost people. It happens.
- Admit it. Admit it!

34:42.081 --> 34:43.750
What are you, five?
Stop repeating...

34:43.875 --> 34:46.961
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.755
Come on, admit it!
Admit it!

34:54.552 --> 34:56.763
Still not boring.

34:59.849 --> 35:02.435
Did you know I was
going to do that?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.228
Because I didn't know
I was going to do that.

35:04.353 --> 35:06.773
I know you have trouble
losing people.

35:07.523 --> 35:09.400
In New Orleans,
I saw you carrying

35:09.525 --> 35:11.986
this express package
around the conference,

35:12.779 --> 35:16.032
and you wouldn't let it go,
but you wouldn't open it,

35:16.157 --> 35:18.201
so I peeked at
the return address.

35:18.326 --> 35:20.077
Diamond, Fairbarren.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.496
Divorce attorneys.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.165
Your first wife had just served you
with papers.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.834
Did you know that
when you bailed me out?

35:26.959 --> 35:30.213
Were you doing
something nice for me?

35:30.338 --> 35:32.048
What did I say
about being boring?

35:34.050 --> 35:35.468
We owe your mom
an apology.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.179
(RINGING)

35:38.304 --> 35:40.431
Hello. It's House.

35:40.556 --> 35:41.933
<i>HOUSE: How'd the bubble test go?</i>

35:42.058 --> 35:44.894
The problem wasn't the cyst.
It's advanced dilated cardiomyopathy.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.480
We did a three-dimensional echo,
showed a mass in the left atrium.

35:47.605 --> 35:49.273
<i>KUTNER: Looks like
an atrial myxoma.</i>

35:49.398 --> 35:52.944
But the ultrasound images are
a little grainy, so it's hard to tell.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.195
House?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.947
The images aren't grainy.

35:56.072 --> 35:57.323
They sure look grainy.

35:57.448 --> 36:00.117
I've seen pictures of you
where you looked tall.

36:00.243 --> 36:01.536
It's an iron overload,

36:01.661 --> 36:03.746
creates speckles on the image,
makes it look grainy.

36:03.871 --> 36:06.582
<i>Also makes her pancreas fail,
her blood clot, her intestines...</i>

36:06.707 --> 36:08.417
Atrial myxoma
is more likely.

36:08.543 --> 36:10.002
MRI for a better view.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.462
<i>Then call me back
and tell me you're embarrassed</i>

36:11.587 --> 36:14.048
because my eyesight
is better 500 miles away.

36:15.299 --> 36:17.260
<i>I need a phone number.</i>

36:17.635 --> 36:19.178
(PHONE RINGING)

36:23.015 --> 36:23.850
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)

36:23.975 --> 36:26.853
I'm a doctor in New Jersey,
treating one of your clients.

36:26.978 --> 36:29.480
Young woman looking for
her biological parents.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.315
You know,
you could just wait for the MRI

36:31.440 --> 36:34.193
to have your curiosity satisfied.

36:34.318 --> 36:38.447
What person who is nothing like me
are you saying that to?

36:39.699 --> 36:41.242
Did the parents look tan?

36:41.367 --> 36:44.370
The disease she has is genetic,
<i>which</i> means they should have it, too.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.330
They don't look more tan
than anyone else.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.582
Discolored teeth?

36:47.707 --> 36:50.251
They're farmers. Their village
doesn't even have a dentist.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.461
Right. Thanks.

36:52.587 --> 36:56.048
But if it matters,
I'm not convinced they were her parents.

36:56.173 --> 36:57.008
Why not?

36:57.133 --> 36:58.843
<i>Because they said
they had no daughter.</i>

36:58.968 --> 37:02.346
The man was adamant, and the woman
seemed confused and frightened.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.806
Thank you.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.102
Differential.

37:08.227 --> 37:11.105
Say you're
a middle-aged Chinese woman.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.940
- Fine.
- Say it.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.026
I'm a middle-aged
Chinese woman.

37:15.151 --> 37:18.613
Girl comes to you,
says that she's your long-lost daughter.

37:18.738 --> 37:20.156
Why would you
be frightened?

37:20.281 --> 37:26.454
I'm frightened because she's a threat,
maybe she knows something.

37:26.579 --> 37:29.123
She hasn't seen you
since she was an infant.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.625
Maybe an inheritance issue.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.168
They're peasants.

37:33.044 --> 37:37.256
Her very presence is a threat.
She...

37:38.090 --> 37:39.550
What year was she born?

37:39.675 --> 37:40.801
'83.

37:40.927 --> 37:42.637
She's not supposed
to be alive.

37:44.096 --> 37:47.516
China introduced
the One Child Policy in 1979.

37:47.642 --> 37:49.894
Say they didn't want a girl.

37:50.019 --> 37:51.479
They tried to kill her.

37:51.604 --> 37:52.772
But maybe the baby
doesn't die,

37:52.897 --> 37:55.024
maybe the father panics,
or regrets it,

37:55.149 --> 37:57.443
takes the baby
to an orphanage,

37:57.568 --> 37:58.778
maybe he doesn't tell his wife.

37:58.903 --> 38:01.781
Who freaks out like
she's seen a ghost 25 years later

38:01.906 --> 38:02.990
when the girl shows up.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.576
But why does attempted murder
from 25 years ago

38:05.701 --> 38:07.411
suddenly become relevant
to her health now?

38:07.536 --> 38:09.580
Maybe they gave her
something toxic.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.499
It would have
to be fat soluble.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.671
This is fun, isn't it?

38:24.053 --> 38:25.304
Let me see the MRI.

38:25.429 --> 38:26.347
We don't have one.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.391
She started vomiting
as soon as we started the scan.

38:28.516 --> 38:32.979
Then let her vomit through the MRI.
That's what nurses are for.

38:33.104 --> 38:36.107
Her parents
tried to kill her.

38:36.816 --> 38:40.820
I don't know how, but I know it
caused her to get sick 25 years later

38:40.945 --> 38:43.280
trying to lift a Buddha.
Explain.

38:44.657 --> 38:47.827
I already had this conversation
with Wilson. Just go with it.

38:47.952 --> 38:48.995
Poison?

38:49.120 --> 38:50.329
Buddha wouldn't make it worse.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.248
Maybe the weight stressed her back,
which...

38:52.373 --> 38:55.084
Makes sense if she's never
lifted anything in her life.

38:55.209 --> 38:58.421
She actually didn't get sick till
she tried lifting it that second time.

38:58.546 --> 39:00.047
I'm guessing
the weight changed.

39:03.759 --> 39:05.970
Anyone have Taub's pager number?

39:06.095 --> 39:07.346
What's up?

39:07.471 --> 39:09.140
Maybe give him a call.

39:09.265 --> 39:12.351
If he tosses that switch on the MRI,
she's dead.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.978
X-ray her brain.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.065
HOUSE: Pins.

39:18.441 --> 39:20.526
Push them through
the soft fontanel of an infant,

39:20.651 --> 39:24.405
you skewer the brain,
and the hair hides the entry wounds.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.865
It's the perfect crime.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.408
She's had them in her
all these years.

39:27.533 --> 39:28.617
What changed
at the temple?

39:28.743 --> 39:30.703
Same thing that changed
in the MRI.

39:30.828 --> 39:33.372
<i>HOUSE: Shockingly,
not all religious leaders are honest.</i>

39:33.497 --> 39:35.833
<i>I'm guessing these particular monks
are bilking the faithful</i>

39:35.958 --> 39:37.877
<i>by pushing a magnet
up Buddha's butt.</i>

39:38.002 --> 39:39.253
<i>There's another one
under the table</i>

39:39.378 --> 39:41.839
<i>that'll repel or attract,
depending on how you shift it.</i>

39:41.964 --> 39:43.507
<i>When she picked up
that magnet,</i>

39:43.632 --> 39:44.675
<i>it moved one of the pins deeper</i>

39:44.800 --> 39:47.011
<i>into the sympathetic nervous center
of her brain.</i>

39:47.136 --> 39:48.554
<i>This sent a signal
through the nerves</i>

39:48.679 --> 39:51.057
<i>to the blood vessels
in her small intestines</i>

39:51.182 --> 39:55.644
that caused the symptoms in China
and in the giant magnet we call an MRI.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.104
She's lucky.

39:58.606 --> 40:02.610
We're all screwed up by our parents,
she's got documentation.

40:06.697 --> 40:09.158
The pins will be removed surgically,
and she'll be fine.

40:09.283 --> 40:12.036
We'll wake her from the coma
after the operation.

40:12.161 --> 40:14.747
Is there any way
you could not tell her?

40:15.414 --> 40:18.125
Please. She's fragile.

40:18.876 --> 40:22.213
She desperately wanted to know
her biological parents.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.799
For her to find out
that they wanted her dead,

40:25.925 --> 40:27.468
I don't know
what that'll do to her.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.929
She may not be
as fragile as you think.

40:30.054 --> 40:31.055
We know our daughter.

40:32.932 --> 40:34.642
See this pin here?

40:34.767 --> 40:38.062
It's been pressing directly
on her addiction center.

40:38.187 --> 40:41.232
It's not her fault,
and it's definitely not your fault.

40:41.357 --> 40:42.983
She's not
who you think she is.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.788
(KNOCKING)

41:00.084 --> 41:03.129
I hear your patient's
going to be all right.

41:05.172 --> 41:10.177
Is that why you're here?
A colleague checking up on a patient?

41:12.096 --> 41:14.431
Something going on?

41:14.557 --> 41:15.724
I'm celebrating.

41:24.358 --> 41:26.152
My mom hated him, too.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.865
Your DNA test showed no match?
That's incredible.

41:30.990 --> 41:33.159
At the age of 12,
you actually figured out

41:33.284 --> 41:35.202
your father
wasn't your birth father?

41:36.120 --> 41:38.122
That's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

41:39.123 --> 41:40.833
Why should it depress you?

41:40.958 --> 41:42.126
It doesn't depress me.

41:42.835 --> 41:46.714
It doesn't make any difference at all.
That's what depresses me.

41:50.217 --> 41:55.598
Well, I guess nobody gets to choose
who their parents are.

41:57.725 --> 42:02.104
I'm not even sure anymore
we get to choose who our friends are.

42:07.985 --> 42:11.155
I spoke with Cuddy.
She hasn't filled my position yet.

42:12.656 --> 42:14.700
If you're coming back
just because you're attracted

42:14.825 --> 42:17.328
to the shine
of my neediness,

42:19.663 --> 42:20.915
I'd be okay with that.

42:24.168 --> 42:26.754
I'm coming back
because you were right.

42:28.130 --> 42:31.926
That strange, annoying trip
we just took

42:32.051 --> 42:34.136
was the most fun I've had
since Amber died.

42:37.890 --> 42:39.350
You hungry?

42:49.818 --> 42:51.487
Wilson.

42:51.612 --> 42:52.780
Yeah?

42:55.783 --> 42:56.951
My dad's dead.

42:58.494 --> 43:01.664
Yeah. My sympathies.
