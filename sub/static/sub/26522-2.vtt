00:16.891 --> 00:18.309
Nellie's in the Red Room.

00:19.936 --> 00:20.770
Shirl.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.359
What did you say?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.569
Grandma's dead.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.363
I know Grandma's dead.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.909
But she still comes to my room at night
and she still sits on my bed,

01:57.992 --> 02:00.286
even though Mommy and Daddy
said she wouldn't.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.457
And I told her not to,
but she was there again last night.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.209
And last night was bad.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.710
She looked different.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.337
Her fingers were purple,

02:09.629 --> 02:12.549
she didn't have teeth,
and she did not have hair.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.219
I don't want to see her again,
especially like that.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.389
So, I'm not going to look at her tomorrow,

02:19.472 --> 02:22.142
and I don't want to see her
in the open castle.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.561
The open casket.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.063
I understand, Max.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.360
I'm guessing your parents
have talked to you

02:32.443 --> 02:34.237
about why you might be having
these dreams.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.115
-They're not dreams.
-And I'm guessing you're a smart boy.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.242
You're so smart, you probably know

02:39.325 --> 02:41.703
that your grandmother
wore a wig, is that right?

02:42.287 --> 02:44.789
You probably saw her in the hospital

02:44.914 --> 02:46.833
a few times when she wasn't
wearing it.

02:46.916 --> 02:47.917
Yeah.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.961
And you probably also know
she had fake teeth.

02:50.044 --> 02:53.381
Maybe she took them out once to show you,
made you laugh.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.384
The thing about an open casket,

02:56.467 --> 02:58.428
and I know it sounds scary,

02:58.511 --> 03:04.184
is that it's a great chance
to take all of those pictures in your head

03:04.267 --> 03:08.021
of Grandma in the hospital,
or Grandma without her hair or teeth,

03:08.104 --> 03:10.690
or anything else in your imagination...

03:11.107 --> 03:16.321
and... cover it all up
with a better... picture.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.281
-Better picture?
-That's right.

03:18.364 --> 03:23.119
Before she's... ever even in the casket,
I'm going to fix her.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.537
That's what I do.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.081
How?

03:29.834 --> 03:33.254
First, we give her a bath...

03:33.338 --> 03:35.465
make sure she's clean and soft.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.678
Then we put special chemicals in
so she stays fixed forever.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.807
Then... we put her in her favorite clothes.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.769
And finally, I take...

03:47.936 --> 03:49.854
extra special care

03:49.938 --> 03:52.649
to make sure she looks
just like she's supposed to.

03:53.274 --> 03:57.654
So, when I'm done...
she will look just like she always did,

03:57.737 --> 03:59.155
just like you remember her.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.824
Just like she is supposed to.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.713
-Is that Hill House?
-No.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.340
Come here, take a look.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.930
This... is our forever house.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.224
You made this?

04:26.557 --> 04:27.642
I designed it, yeah.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.978
-I design them and--
-Daddy builds them.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.855
It... just looks like a lot of lines.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.024
Hmm. That's true.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.402
But when I look at it...

04:37.860 --> 04:40.863
I see a family
running to a dinner table...

04:41.322 --> 04:42.949
from all three directions.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.494
This dining room is the heart
of the house.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.871
Everything flows in and out, see?

04:49.163 --> 04:51.749
Every house needs a heart
and this is ours,

04:51.833 --> 04:54.127
because that's where we spend
the most time together.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.879
You know, a house is like a person's body.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.215
The walls are like bones...

04:59.757 --> 05:02.677
the pipes are veins,
it needs to breathe,

05:02.760 --> 05:04.554
it needs light and flow,

05:04.929 --> 05:08.516
and it all works together to keep us safe
and healthy inside.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.519
I don't see any of that.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.062
It's okay.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.566
When you're little, you learn how
to see things that aren't there.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.569
And when you grow up,
you learn how to make them real.

05:19.777 --> 05:20.778
Which is my room?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.781
Mm. That's where you'll be.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.160
But on the second floor,
this is ground floor.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.287
When we finish fixing up this house and--

05:29.370 --> 05:30.955
Sell it for a lot of money.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.083
You don't miss a thing. Yes.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.502
Then we're going to build
the forever house,

05:36.586 --> 05:37.920
and we won't have to move,

05:38.004 --> 05:38.880
ever again.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.177
Shirley. Shirley.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.012
Where'd you go?

05:46.095 --> 05:48.264
Nellie, I told you,
I'm too old for tea parties.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.933
Mommy, will you please have
a tea party with me?

05:51.517 --> 05:53.269
Everyone keeps saying no.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.897
Sweetheart, I'd love to have
a tea party with you,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.024
but I have to finish working,
I'm afraid.

06:01.110 --> 06:04.238
-How about we play outside instead?
-I guess.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.366
How about a tea party outside?

06:06.449 --> 06:07.784
You can play outside until dinner,

06:07.867 --> 06:10.870
-but when I flash the porch light twice...
-Time to come home.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.915
That's the rule.
Nellie, let me hear you say it.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.376
Porch light means it's time
to come home.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.044
'Kay. Go have fun.

06:24.675 --> 06:28.596
Did you know that princesses and queens
and kings had tea parties?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.682
It sounds like a kid thing,
but it isn't.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.436
It's very grown-up and uh-fisticated.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.938
"Sophisticated."

06:37.313 --> 06:38.356
Ask Theo.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.316
Maybe she'll have one with you.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.360
Theo!

06:44.737 --> 06:46.989
Will you have a tea party with me

06:47.073 --> 06:48.699
-No.
-Why?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.423
-You good, Luke?
-Uh-huh.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.925
Don't forget the rule. Lights flash...

07:06.175 --> 07:07.427
Time to come home.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.360
I appreciate your advice.
I mean, I...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.821
I know you've worked
this house for so long.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.828
-You stay close, now.
-Okay.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.082
Oh. Uh, another question.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.668
That master key you had
didn't work.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.213
You have any other ideas about
that red door upstairs?

07:44.630 --> 07:47.758
Um... afraid not.
Not, not for that one.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.747
Oh.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.374
Hi.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.168
Where's your mommy?

09:05.670 --> 09:06.587
Hey.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.257
Hey, how'd you get in here, huh?

09:10.132 --> 09:11.300
Where's your mommy cat?

09:12.093 --> 09:15.012
She couldn't be far.
She needs to feed you.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.600
But you're just the cutest little thing.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.502
Well, look at that.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.171
You think it's empty?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.424
We'd have seen some.
Probably dead.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.467
Come here, Shirley, you gotta see this.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.805
It's okay.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.768
It's a wasp nest.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.856
-Probably an old one.
-Uh, very old.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.234
You see, sometimes they build their nest
around things.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.570
I've seen a nest
built around a wind chime.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.904
It looked so cool.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.657
Ah, there it is.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.202
Haven't seen one like this, though.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.372
I don't blame you for screaming.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.542
There. Built it around this.

10:26.917 --> 10:27.877
You know what that is?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.129
-A mask?
-Yup.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.255
A Halloween mask.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.884
-Old one.
-You see? Nothing scary at all.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.678
You're lucky those wasps are long gone.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.930
You might have something
to really scream about.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.560
These little kittens don't have a mommy.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.105
You don't know that.
She could be out there somewhere.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.857
Odd her leaving them alone.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.195
-Especially close to dark like this.
-Well, we can't just leave them here.

10:54.945 --> 10:55.946
The dogs.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.616
-Dogs?
-I don't know, Shirl.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.533
Please.

11:00.034 --> 11:04.038
Mr. Dudley, have you ever seen those dogs

11:04.538 --> 11:06.916
-No dogs on the property.
-Well, sure there are.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.542
The kids have been hearing
them at night.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.628
They've heard them every night
since we got here.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.587
I couldn't say.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.715
The missus and I, we don't stay
on the property after dark.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.175
But...

11:17.009 --> 11:17.843
no.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.929
I've never seen dogs.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.389
Please, Daddy?

11:21.847 --> 11:22.765
Please?

11:25.559 --> 11:28.437
Come on, Mom.
I told you I wanted to be Daredevil.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.315
That's why I got you that,
so you can decorate it however you want.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.360
I don't want to decorate.
I just want to be Daredevil.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.028
It's more fun when you get to be creative

11:36.112 --> 11:37.988
instead of just buying
what other kids buys.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.408
Mom, you're killing me.

11:40.908 --> 11:41.867
Killing me, Mom.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.162
Can't you just decorate that
to look like Devil Man?

11:45.246 --> 11:47.456
-Devil Man.
-Or... whoever?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
It means more when you make it yourself.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.543
Hey, guys.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.211
It's almost Halloween.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.255
I need a costume I can wear
to Austin's party,

11:54.338 --> 11:55.965
not some craft project.

11:56.048 --> 11:56.882
Try it.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.343
Austin said if our masks
don't look good enough

11:59.427 --> 12:00.636
the ghosts will know it's us

12:00.720 --> 12:02.471
-and they'll come after me.
-Jayden.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.557
There's no such thing as ghosts
and you know it.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.434
Go upstairs. We're working in here.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.103
-Watch out for the...

12:10.271 --> 12:11.981
Forever House.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.065
So that went well.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.734
Like a charm.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.696
-How's Tyson?
-He's worried.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.948
We went over it all, and again...

12:21.031 --> 12:23.576
-We're in the black, though?
-We are, but barely.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.203
And Tyson's saying it again
just like last quarter.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.707
-We're in the black.
-We have to do better.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.377
Which means you can't keep cutting prices
when you feel like it.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.629
-Kevin.
-I'm sorry, you handle the funerals,

12:35.713 --> 12:38.716
-I handle the books. That was the deal.
-We're doing more than well enough

12:38.799 --> 12:41.177
to give a little relief
to families who need it the most.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.179
It's not relief, Shirl, it's charity.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.558
You're giving stuff away at cost,
below cost.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.643
-Only for special cases.
-More than half.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.686
No way.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.064
More than half of our intakes last quarter
were special cases.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.942
If it's more than half, it's not special,
it's normal.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.528
I have the whole thing in here.
I'll show you.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.615
-Bullshit, "more than half."
-Here, I will show you.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.575
Hello.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.577
Uh, right back here.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.579
-Sorry, we didn't hear the door.
-It's okay.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.291
I just wanted to drop these off,
like we discussed.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.544
There's some jewelry in here,
some pictures of Mom, like you asked.

13:16.003 --> 13:19.131
I couldn't decide so
I just put a bunch in.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.847
Thank you for dropping these by.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.808
They'll be really helpful.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.978
Is Max feeling better about tomorrow?

13:33.437 --> 13:34.355
A little.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.940
Your wife definitely helped,

13:36.023 --> 13:37.566
but he's still nervous.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.692
I can tell.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.259
Did you ever connect with Nell?

14:04.593 --> 14:08.848
No, but Steve checked in with Luke.
He's fine in rehab.

14:08.931 --> 14:09.932
Ugh.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.768
-How many is this for him?
-I don't know. I lost track.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.646
You want me to bring this downstairs?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.439
Yes, please.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.150
I hate going downstairs.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.118
-On the phone you said he had insurance.
-Right.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.787
We thought so. He told us so.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.083
-This morning we tried to get the info--
-It had lapsed a few months back.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.585
-He didn't--
-He just didn't tell us.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.296
It happens all the time, I'm afraid,
especially with first-timers.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.465
We can still do this.
We're going to split the cost.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.758
He needs to be here.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.302
It's fine.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.138
Without an insurance policy,
it's $6,000 a month,

14:49.221 --> 14:51.849
and we do recommend
a four-to-six month commitment.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.395
-I'm sorry, did you say $6,000?
-A month.

14:56.979 --> 14:57.855
That's right.

15:01.692 --> 15:05.070
And obviously if he had insurance
it would be in...

15:06.113 --> 15:08.157
the ballpark of what we discussed
on the phone.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.994
Yes... but if his policy is lapsed...

15:14.663 --> 15:15.497
I know.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.543
The first month for sure,

15:19.627 --> 15:22.254
and I can come back in two weeks...

15:22.630 --> 15:25.299
with some more, if I move
some things around.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.052
That's fine.
We can see how the first month goes.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.891
I'm sorry, Shirl. I--

15:33.974 --> 15:35.392
-It's fine.
-I can still do--

15:35.476 --> 15:37.728
You can pay me back when
you're a famous writer.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.147
You might not
wanna hold your breath.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.025
Apparently historical fiction
is out of vogue.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.740
-You're all set.
-Yeah.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.701
-What do I, uh...
-We're all set.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.536
I'm gonna need a UA.

15:55.704 --> 15:56.580
What?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.165
Urine Analysis.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.667
First time, huh?

15:59.750 --> 16:02.544
Did you know they have horseback riding?
They have horseback riding.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.672
A UA, right.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.548
What if there's still...

16:06.757 --> 16:08.258
It's okay if you're not clean.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.302
We just need to know how dirty.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.763
All right.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.268
Aw, shit. Wish me luck.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.321
We love you so much.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.952
You can do this.

16:36.078 --> 16:36.912
Thanks.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.251
Anything you need.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.632
You got this.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.342
Yeah.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.264
They have horses.

17:02.104 --> 17:02.980
He can do it.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.149
He's gonna do it.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.912
KEVIN HARRIS

17:27.046 --> 17:28.922
I kind of like the Captain "Lame" mask.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.299
It's all yours.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.053
-Where'd you get those, Allie?
-At the mall.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.973
Practically begged me.
She has to be like her cool Aunt Theo.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.308
I did not!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.186
Nope, you're finishing
the Brussels sprouts.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.896
You're on fire today, Mom.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.397
Watch it, Captain Lame.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.940
Both of you. They're delicious.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.650
They smell like cat piss.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.903
-Jayden.
-Watch your tone.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.697
Unless you want to spend Halloween
as Captain Grounded.

17:53.781 --> 17:54.740
Great.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.369
I don't know, it was weird.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.498
Solo account, his name's on the checkbook.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.374
-So?
-So we only have joint accounts.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.793
I don't know that account.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.377
It was just in his briefcase.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.589
-You're going through his briefcase?
-Looking at quarterlies, not like...

18:10.714 --> 18:12.549
It was just there.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.009
It surprised me.

18:14.968 --> 18:15.928
Ask him.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.722
-I'm sure it's nothing.
-I don't want to seem like...

18:18.806 --> 18:21.308
I don't know. It's probably nothing.
It's just...

18:21.391 --> 18:22.851
weird.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.271
Well, be sure to let your imagination
get the best of you.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.481
That's the first step.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.484
Imagine the worst thing possible,
assume it's true, and go from there.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.528
Can I have cookies and milk
for dessert?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.155
Did you eat all of your food?

18:35.405 --> 18:36.240
Yes.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.589
There's five of them
like there's five of us.

18:52.923 --> 18:53.924
That one's me.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.051
Like this.

18:56.927 --> 19:00.681
You get... just enough
and you drop a little on their nose,

19:00.806 --> 19:04.143
because their eyes aren't open yet
and they need to know it.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.562
See?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.565
And then when they open...

19:11.108 --> 19:11.984
Wow.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.862
Do you want to try it?

19:22.452 --> 19:25.038
What?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.919
Huh

19:31.086 --> 19:33.964
-I don't need--
-Why are you banging on the wall?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.425
-I'm not.
-You are.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.010
And calling my name.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.595
What do you want?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.101
There they are again.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.646
You're banging on the wall
to tell me about stupid dogs?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.859
What was that?

19:56.570 --> 19:57.571
What is that?

19:59.823 --> 20:00.657
Shirley...

20:05.454 --> 20:06.580
What is it?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.374
[bell chimes[

20:35.525 --> 20:36.443
Help!

20:46.703 --> 20:49.706
Hey.
Hey, what's with the screaming?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.583
Did you hear that

20:51.667 --> 20:52.542
What was what?

20:52.626 --> 20:55.295
There were these loud bangs
all over the walls.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.922
I didn't hear it. I don't--

20:57.005 --> 20:59.716
It was so loud!
How could you not hear it?

21:00.509 --> 21:01.426
I believe you.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.304
I believe you.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.223
I know. I know.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.144
Listen, there's
nothing to be...

21:12.854 --> 21:13.981
Pipes.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.733
The hot water pipes, they're old.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.695
They can bang and jump in the walls.

21:20.904 --> 21:21.863
I bet that's what it was.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.491
Look.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.286
It's over now, right?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.373
It's o...

21:33.792 --> 21:36.712
-Just the pipes.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.883
Jesus.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.595
Steve.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.014
It's...

21:47.389 --> 21:48.223
It's Nell.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.726
It's the middle of the night.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.727
She's dead.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.730
Shut up.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.523
She's dead, Shirl.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.693
I'm not so...

22:00.694 --> 22:01.695
good.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.826
What

22:10.162 --> 22:11.580
She killed herself.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.420
It's so weird. I came home tonight...

22:21.923 --> 22:23.550
and I was in my living room...

22:25.218 --> 22:26.136
and...

22:26.762 --> 22:27.804
and she was...

22:27.929 --> 22:30.724
Well, you're wrong. Someone...

22:31.391 --> 22:32.601
They got it wrong.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.771
I mean, she was just...

22:36.855 --> 22:39.191
Um... who told you this?

22:40.692 --> 22:43.070
-Dad called me.
-Well, he's wrong.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.865
He was the last person she
talked to before she did it.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.868
He was the last person she called.

22:50.035 --> 22:50.994
Bullshit.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.997
What did he say?

22:54.081 --> 22:55.665
That she killed herself.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.418
And I didn't...

22:59.294 --> 23:01.171
He didn't exactly tell me, I...

23:03.298 --> 23:05.509
I couldn't really hear him,
because I...

23:07.302 --> 23:08.261
I saw...

23:08.553 --> 23:10.555
No, he wouldn't know.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.558
She wouldn't...
She wouldn't call him.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.814
He can't...

23:20.607 --> 23:21.441
do that again.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.985
He can't just not tell us what happened.
He can't.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.738
I'm sorry, Shirl.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.074
But she has gone.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.829
I told you.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.707
I told you she was in trouble.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.544
I told you to find her. I told you!

23:41.962 --> 23:43.213
I gotta go.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.304
What is it

24:34.014 --> 24:35.557
-Good morning.

24:56.703 --> 24:57.579
Wake up.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.714
Hey.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.300
I found this upstairs.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.093
Decorated it a little bit for her.

25:12.844 --> 25:13.678
Why?

25:14.262 --> 25:16.223
Well, because she was
a very special cat,

25:16.306 --> 25:19.059
and she deserves
a special place to rest.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.353
Is she in there?

25:21.436 --> 25:22.270
Yep.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.148
Can I see her?

25:33.490 --> 25:35.450
Do you want to say something about her?

25:36.201 --> 25:37.827
-Should I?
-You could.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.080
People usually do.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.249
It's called a eulogy.

25:42.791 --> 25:43.917
Well, what do I say?

25:45.168 --> 25:46.086
It's up to you.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.587
Some people say goodbye.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.839
Or...

25:50.549 --> 25:52.133
-you could tell a story.
-Mm-hm.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.343
What kind of story?

25:54.302 --> 25:55.387
Whatever you like.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.265
You know how when you take
one of your pictures,

25:58.348 --> 26:00.976
you capture something forever,
just the way it is?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.061
Stories do that, too.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.188
So when things...

26:08.483 --> 26:09.568
When we die...

26:10.527 --> 26:11.903
we turn into stories.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.739
And every time someone tells
one of those stories,

26:14.823 --> 26:16.366
it's like we're still here...

26:16.825 --> 26:17.701
for them.

26:19.077 --> 26:19.995
We're all...

26:20.912 --> 26:22.497
stories in the end.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.541
Now, try.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.844
This kitten grew up in a tool shed
and my room.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.638
I'm not sure what her name was

26:38.722 --> 26:41.057
because her brothers and sisters
all looked the same,

26:41.141 --> 26:44.394
but I... think she was the one
I called Jasper.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.395
Hmm.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.397
She was a good kitten and...

26:49.566 --> 26:52.902
and... she never hurt a single thing in...

26:53.403 --> 26:56.698
her whole life and
not many people can say that.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.118
-That's perfect, sweetie.
-Mm-hm.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.789
Goodbye, little kitty.
I hope you have a safe trip to Heaven,

27:04.873 --> 27:08.460
and when you get there, there's some
nice, yummy milk waiting, and...

27:11.713 --> 27:12.714
She's alive.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.132
What?

27:14.215 --> 27:15.258
She--

27:16.926 --> 27:18.094
She's alive!

27:19.054 --> 27:20.889
Honey, look, I know this is--

27:20.972 --> 27:22.515
No, she is. She is...

27:23.350 --> 27:25.143
She really is. Look.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.438
-Honey, I know--
-Her lips are moving.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.190
Okay... Hey...

27:30.273 --> 27:32.233
-Hey, it's okay.
-Wait, wait a second.

27:32.317 --> 27:35.153
Wake up, little kitty.
It's okay, I'm right here.

27:36.863 --> 27:37.947
Yeah...

27:55.674 --> 27:58.218
I'll need you to head up there,
pick up the body,

27:58.301 --> 27:59.803
and bring her back here.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.764
And pack her carefully.
It's a long drive.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.641
Sure.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.312
Listen, I'm very sorry.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.190
-I don't know what to say in these--
-It...

28:13.191 --> 28:14.192
It's fine, Andi.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.070
Call me when you're on the road.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.867
-I don't think it's a good idea.
-It's the right thing.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.412
Why not send her to Carlisle?
They'll do a great job there.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.832
-I think it's a bad idea, too.
-Honey, let someone else do it.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.126
-You need to focus on you--
-She's my sister.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.962
I'm hosting her funeral. That's that.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.922
Is it going to give everyone time?

28:36.506 --> 28:37.465
What do you mean?

28:38.049 --> 28:40.009
I mean Steven, Luke, Dad.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.303
Dad's the reason Nell was so fucked up
to begin with

28:42.387 --> 28:44.431
and Luke's probably high as a kite.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.475
-I thought he was in rehab.
-He was apparently, until this morning.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.145
They said he flew the coop.
No idea where he is.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.605
-Does he even know that she's dead?
-No idea.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.982
If he doesn't, that's on him.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.402
He deserves to be here.
You're not giving him time to get here.

28:57.485 --> 29:00.029
He missed her wedding,
we're not gonna let him miss her funeral.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.657
He has time, but I'm not leaving her
in a freezer

29:02.741 --> 29:04.784
until Luke gets his shit together.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.661
She'll be there forever.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.038
I'm... I gotta get to work.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.791
Shirl... Shirl.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.310
Sweetie, we've talked
about this.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.228
Max, you can do it,
I know you can.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.354
You can.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.106
Good morning.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.778
It's the moment of truth, Max.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.160
It's okay.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.828
I don't want to.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.248
If you don't, you'll be upset later.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.334
I promise...

29:55.001 --> 29:56.252
this is a good thing...

29:56.586 --> 29:57.796
and you're a good boy.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.883
And you can do this.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.556
I'll go with you.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.105
Shirley...

30:19.192 --> 30:21.152
It's gonna be okay, Shirley.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.446
I don't want to see her.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.160
It's important.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.373
Look, even Nellie's up there.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.377
-No, I don't want to go.
-Shirley...

30:37.460 --> 30:38.753
No.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.047
Is everything okay?

30:41.881 --> 30:43.800
She's just a little scared, I think.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.260
Oh, that's okay.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.303
Here, come with me.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.616
Absolutely not.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.243
Shirl, she's fantastic.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.996
-You've nothing to worry about.
-You don't know her.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.039
You don't have to know someone
to do the cosmetics.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.040
And restoration.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.167
The coroner ruled it a suicide,

31:18.251 --> 31:20.044
and there's restorative work
I've got to do.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.297
-Shirl...
-She was in that house for hours.

31:22.755 --> 31:25.633
She's... The blood pooled, insects,
her injuries...

31:26.384 --> 31:29.137
She was only refrigerated
for a couple of hours,

31:29.220 --> 31:31.264
and then in transport, the level of...

31:31.347 --> 31:34.142
In time it will take me
to explain to you what to do with her,

31:34.225 --> 31:36.185
I could just do it myself,
so I'm doing her myself.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.854
This... is insane.

31:38.771 --> 31:40.064
Excuse us, please.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.445
I owe her this.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.906
This is too much for anyone.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.283
The hours, the bugs...

31:51.367 --> 31:52.869
I'm doing it, Kevin.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.916
I'll fix her.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.436
I gotta go.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.271
I'm sorry, I...

32:20.897 --> 32:22.065
just can't, Shirl.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.963
Let's take her down.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.076
-Can I feed the kittens?
-Sure thing.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.953
Just, remember how I showed you.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.627
Are they still sleeping?

34:22.393 --> 34:23.352
No...

34:23.603 --> 34:25.146
No, no, no, no.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.564
-No.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.651
Shirley?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.579
Well, that's what's happening, Steve.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.207
I don't care how you get here,

34:44.290 --> 34:46.167
-just get here.
-You're taking on too much.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.878
-You've gotta just be able to grieve.
-Don't talk to me that way.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.172
I don't even know where Luke is.
We've been looking.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.757
-You and Dad?
-That's right.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.343
We've been looking,
but they don't know where he went.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.595
Apparently he went out
of a goddamn window.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.014
Steve, do you know
what I'm doing right now?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.183
I'm elbow deep in our sister's
chest cavity

35:02.266 --> 35:04.227
pulling out a bag of her internal organs.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.604
That's what happens
when a body's autopsied

35:06.687 --> 35:08.272
and I have to take it out.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.359
You have to get two grown men
to a goddamn airport.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.443
Get it done.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.076
She's doing it herself.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.204
She isn't.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.747
She's doing it herself.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.376
This kind of thing happens.

35:29.585 --> 35:32.171
Kittens aren't supposed to be
without their mommies.

35:32.797 --> 35:36.175
And no matter how much you love them,
you're not their mommy.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.344
And they're...

35:39.428 --> 35:40.513
They're better now.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.307
They're where they're supposed to be.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.060
What about the little one?

35:47.353 --> 35:48.563
What about the eyes?

35:51.399 --> 35:52.733
We found it a new home.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.780
But why didn't you let me
take care of it?

35:57.864 --> 35:59.740
-Or at least say goodbye?
-Shirl...

36:00.116 --> 36:02.368
we have no idea what was wrong
with those kittens,

36:02.451 --> 36:03.578
they were very sick.

36:04.078 --> 36:07.081
We couldn't let you try to take care
of a pet who was so sick.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.584
But... you gave it to someone else.

36:10.626 --> 36:12.879
-We...
-I don't believe you.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.339
Shirl...

36:16.007 --> 36:17.550
-um...
-Just tell me.

36:17.633 --> 36:18.926
Just... just...

36:19.010 --> 36:22.597
Why would you give away the
last one, the only one left?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.765
-Just quiet...
-It's not fair!

36:24.932 --> 36:26.893
-Just stop it! Stop it!
-It's not fair!

36:34.233 --> 36:35.234
Mm.

36:35.318 --> 36:38.196
It's been a minute since you had
one of your color storms.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.033
That's the thing.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.368
There was no color at all.

36:44.827 --> 36:46.579
It was pitch black.

36:49.081 --> 36:49.999
Like...

36:50.666 --> 36:51.500
like...

36:52.376 --> 36:53.502
fireworks, but...

36:55.046 --> 36:55.922
black.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.925
And it hit me like a...

36:59.884 --> 37:01.761
It's never come that fast before.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.805
First migraine in what, a year?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.934
And it happens at the worst
possible moment.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.479
-And you're better?
-Mm.

37:12.104 --> 37:14.690
Codeine's finally kicking in.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.784
I wish I had been
part of that conversation.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.748
Would you have said different?

37:32.333 --> 37:33.251
Probably not.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.261
I got it.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.813
Would you have said you had
to go to the woods and...

37:54.188 --> 37:56.565
put this sick little kitten
out of its misery?

37:58.192 --> 38:02.488
No, of course not, but it's a tough thing
for a kid, and we should--

38:02.571 --> 38:04.949
Look, she's going to have a pretty
messed up view of death

38:05.032 --> 38:06.742
coming out of this no matter what,

38:06.826 --> 38:08.911
which wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't have...

38:10.955 --> 38:11.872
Go ahead.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.791
No, it was unfair.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.584
Go ahead anyway.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.962
Why the hell did you let her
keep those kittens?

38:18.045 --> 38:20.423
Well, I didn't know that they were
all gonna die.

38:20.506 --> 38:24.719
You let her keep a box of diseased kittens
in her bedroom.

38:24.927 --> 38:27.388
And now she's traumatized.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.142
Her first real brush with death
and now she's...

38:31.225 --> 38:33.769
And then I have one chance
to pull it back,

38:33.853 --> 38:37.398
and I lie to her face
and lock up with a migraine.

38:38.941 --> 38:42.153
This was not our finest hour,
no doubt.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.575
Shit.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.333
Sorry.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.585
You're not allowed down here.
You know that.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.420
-I know, we were just--
-It's okay.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.173
It's just, Auntie Nell.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.050
I know.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.511
I know you're curious.

39:49.428 --> 39:50.554
And sad.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.140
I'm sad, too.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.851
So sad I can't even tell you.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.230
What do you want to know?

40:03.275 --> 40:04.318
I won't lie to you.

40:04.693 --> 40:07.613
Any questions you have
are completely normal, okay?

40:08.614 --> 40:09.990
What are you doing to her?

40:11.534 --> 40:14.620
I just finished embalming her,
and it helps her look...

40:14.995 --> 40:16.247
how we remember.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.581
Why did she die?

40:20.167 --> 40:21.001
I don't know.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.796
Just so sad that she did.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.589
She loved you both so much.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.676
-Where is she now?
-I don't know, Allie.

40:29.718 --> 40:30.719
Nobody knows.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.640
I can tell you what I think, maybe,
sometime tomorrow.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.769
But mostly I'm just sad.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.398
I know you're curious about her,

40:42.481 --> 40:44.442
but this part isn't for people to see.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.736
I can tell you everything
I'm doing, but...

40:48.529 --> 40:49.572
some other time.

40:50.322 --> 40:51.740
Right now.

40:57.246 --> 41:01.542
Why don't you two go pick your favorite
picture of Auntie Nell

41:01.625 --> 41:03.127
from one of the albums...

41:03.919 --> 41:06.464
and I can hang it at the funeral?

41:08.215 --> 41:09.049
Okay?

41:10.759 --> 41:11.635
Okay.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.483
I'm so excited.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.443
You're gonna look amazing.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.862
You already look amazing.

42:12.988 --> 42:14.532
You know what I mean.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.494
Gorgeous. Uh!

42:18.744 --> 42:21.622
-Come on, we still got a ways to go.
-I know, but you do.

42:22.414 --> 42:24.166
I'm so happy for you, Nellie.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.669
Come in.

42:28.587 --> 42:29.463
Hey.

42:29.922 --> 42:30.756
Hey.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.010
Wow. You look amazing.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.345
Thanks.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.430
How's Arthur

42:38.514 --> 42:40.683
He's great. I handcuffed him
to a radiator downstairs.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.268
-He's not going anywhere.
-Steve.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.687
He's as happy as I've ever seen a guy.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.647
And he should be.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.571
Well, anyway, I just wanted to say
break a leg.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.906
-And if you make a run for it...

42:55.990 --> 42:57.908
-I'll keep the car running, okay?
-Okay.

43:04.290 --> 43:07.585
How lucky for us,
a famous author at your wedding.

43:08.210 --> 43:09.461
-You promised.

43:10.629 --> 43:13.924
I know. Not another word, I promise.

43:23.976 --> 43:24.852
What is it?

43:25.894 --> 43:28.355
Nothing. I should be right back.
We'll finish up.

43:34.778 --> 43:35.738
Hey.

43:36.071 --> 43:38.365
Hey, I didn't know if this was--

43:38.449 --> 43:39.366
The hell, Luke

43:39.450 --> 43:42.161
-Taxi, hold up!
-What? Hey, I'm fine.

43:42.369 --> 43:43.454
I'm fine.

43:44.663 --> 43:45.789
I just...

43:45.914 --> 43:48.626
I just wanted to make sure
I got to tell her that I was happy--

43:48.709 --> 43:49.668
Look at me.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.378
-What?
-Look at me.

43:55.507 --> 43:56.467
You're high.

43:58.093 --> 43:58.969
No.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.596
No, I'm not.

44:00.679 --> 44:02.640
-So you got the day pass?
-Yeah.

44:02.723 --> 44:05.809
-They're very supportive.
-Luke, I paid for rehab.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.936
Guess who they called
when you ran away last week?

44:09.480 --> 44:10.606
Last week.

44:10.689 --> 44:12.941
Shirl, she's expecting me to be here.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.026
No, she's not.

44:14.109 --> 44:14.943
Nobody is.

44:16.403 --> 44:17.655
Today's about Nell.

44:18.113 --> 44:19.615
-Yeah.
-Do you get that?

44:19.698 --> 44:20.824
This is her day.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.410
You're not smearing your shit
all over her day, Luke.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.870
-Shirl--
-You're not.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.997
I'm level, I just...

44:27.206 --> 44:29.500
I just really want to be here for her.

44:29.583 --> 44:32.002
You should've thought that
before you put the needle in your arm.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.922
What's the cab Thirty?

44:37.132 --> 44:38.258
Here's a hundred.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.010
You can shoot up the rest,
I don't care.

44:40.928 --> 44:43.013
This is the last I ever give you.

44:44.098 --> 44:47.559
No more loans,
no more treatment centers, nothing.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.979
The store's closed. I'm done.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.360
I...

44:58.821 --> 45:00.030
um...

45:02.741 --> 45:04.952
Sorry. Bridesmaid stuff.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.454
-Is everything okay?
-Everything's perfect.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.540
You're gonna have the perfect wedding.

45:10.791 --> 45:11.834
Almost perfect.

45:26.306 --> 45:27.266
I'm sorry.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.055
You...

46:49.097 --> 46:50.265
you fixed her.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.478
Well, that's what I do.

46:59.399 --> 47:00.442
You fixed her.

47:03.487 --> 47:04.988
You fixed her.
