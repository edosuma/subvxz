00:09.400 --> 00:13.188
Big day today, Peg.
I'm getting a raise.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.915
Al, you haven't had a raise
since our honeymoon.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.791
And even that was below minimum.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.598
What's for breakfast today, Peg?

00:25.800 --> 00:28.519
Scrambled nothing
or nothing over easy?

00:29.320 --> 00:32.311
You know, Al, I've been a little
concerned about your cholesterol.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.990
So I've switched to Nothing Beaters.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.672
Besides, your paycheque is so small,
we can't afford the luxuries of life.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.714
Gee, Peg,
is a shotgun considered a luxury?

00:45.720 --> 00:52.319
Maybe. But unlike you, Al, a shotgun
can go off more than once a month.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.672
If I had something worth stuffing...

00:55.880 --> 00:58.440
...maybe I'd take my gun
in the woods more often.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.513
Mom, have you seen
my lucky audition blouse?

01:06.720 --> 01:09.757
- What does it look like?
- It's see-through.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.195
Maybe that's why I can't find it.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.556
Hi, there. I have a free gift for Peg
Bundy, Home Shopper of the Month.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.240
Kelly, give the man a tip.

01:27.560 --> 01:31.439
I get dressed with the curtains
open every morning.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.398
I know.
Why do you think I picked this route?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.073
Bye.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.920 --> 01:55.672
What is it?

01:57.160 --> 01:59.116
It's a microwave oven.

01:59.320 --> 02:03.074
What kind of cruel joke is this?
Send it back.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.470
Wait. No, no, no.
I've heard about these.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.832
Now, whenever you want hot food,
all you have to do is press the buttons.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.679
So it's like the phone.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.873
Hello.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.837
I'm telling you, buddy,
hard as we work, we deserve a raise.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.077
Let us in!

03:02.680 --> 03:04.955
Oh, Griff, it's your turn.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.435
All right.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.796
You know, I could get a trained chimp
to do your job...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.639
...but it'd be a waste
of a perfectly good trained chimp.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.992
Yeah, but it's such a nice vacation
for him to get out of your bedroom.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.798
By the way,
I think that is one lucky chimp.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.470
This year,
we're going to have a sales contest.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.557
First place gets the raise.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.957
Second place
gets a swift kick in the ass.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.550
Why don't you give us a real incentive?
Let the winner kick you in the ass.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.111
Instead of kicking my butt,
you should be kissing it.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.313
Hey, what do you think I look like,
your monkey?

04:06.640 --> 04:10.110
- That stinks.
- Yeah. Sorry, it's a tough break, buddy.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.231
What are you talking about?

04:12.440 --> 04:15.318
Well, come on, Griff,
you can't compete with my charm.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.192
I'm a natural-born salesman.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.038
- Excuse me-
- Hey!

04:19.279 --> 04:23.034
Do I come to the hag shop,
bother you when you're working?

04:26.280 --> 04:30.273
This contest is no contest.
You're going down, Bundy.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.948
Let's rock, fat boy.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.997
Your mama.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.195
My wife.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.872
You win.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.236
No, I don't.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.555
Mom, I'm telling you,
this microwave is broken.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.958
Now, I keep pressing the popcorn
button and no popcorn's coming out.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.794
Well, try pressing lamb, pork or veal.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.116
Wonder which one it will be.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.437
Excuse me, Betty and Moronica.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.680
You gotta put food in it first.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.996
Well, then what good is it?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.951
Oh, look, wait. I found something
way here in the back.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.031
It's a little turtle.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.355
Timmy Turtle?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.077
You said he went to go live
on a farm...

05:38.280 --> 05:41.511
...where he had more room
to romp and play.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.193
Well, honey, actually,
Timmy Turtle had a terrible disease...

05:46.400 --> 05:50.029
...and we decided to freeze him
until we could find a cure.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.038
He has no head, Mom.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.034
Well, that was his disease.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.829
Well, do they have a cure
for that yet?

06:01.880 --> 06:04.997
Well, when they find a cure for that,
you'll be the first to know.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.076
See you soon, Timmy.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.110
Oh, look, here's a meatball.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.709
Oh, put that in. Come on.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.518
Oh, my God. That meatball has eyes.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.830
Timmy!

06:39.520 --> 06:41.556
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.558
I wonder what
a bigger head would do.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.875
That's your father.
Quick, hide the microwave.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.436
If he smells turtle brains,
he's gonna want dinner. Go on.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.635
Something smells good.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.389
<i>Oh, gee, Al, I saw that on Oprah.</i>

07:12.600 --> 07:18.072
Smelling things that aren't really there
is the first the sign of a brain tumour.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.474
Gee, Peg, I thought...

07:19.680 --> 07:22.638
<i>...that watching Oprah was
the first sign of a brain tumour.</i>

07:28.240 --> 07:29.753
There you go.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.509
There it is, ma'am.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.513
No waiting at Register 2.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.349
Free shoes.

07:45.560 --> 07:49.348
- Can you help me?
- Madam, I would be delighted.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.394
Do these shoes make me look fat?
Be honest.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.191
No, they make you look very... fat.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.394
I'm sorry, I'm new at this.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.352
May I add, that's a lovely broach...

08:04.880 --> 08:07.758
...or is it cud stain?

08:10.680 --> 08:14.753
Score one more
for the Griff Express!

08:15.880 --> 08:18.633
You know, Griff,
because I respect our friendship...

08:18.840 --> 08:21.115
...I'm willing to split that raise
right now.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.912
Like I'm gonna fall for that.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.476
Come on, Griff. We ought to
make Gary give us both a raise.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.716
- How?
- Well, I mean...

08:28.920 --> 08:31.514
...she must be doing
something illegal.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.188
Yeah, but will the monkey
wear a wire?

08:38.320 --> 08:40.150
Sign here for shoes
from the sweatshop.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.510
Not now, kid.
We're trying to blackmail someone.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.553
Please, hurry. If I am late
getting back to the sweatshop...

08:45.760 --> 08:48.991
<i>...they'll make we watch
Caroline in the City.</i>

08:50.160 --> 08:51.991
Kid, we're talking here.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.590
Now, what can we
blackmail Gary with?

08:56.080 --> 08:59.914
Excuse me, but I have to get back
to Gary's sweatshop.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.758
Hey. This kid just gave me
a great idea.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.679
Long John Silver's for lunch?

09:08.280 --> 09:12.353
No. Don't you get it?
Sweatshop, blackmail.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.313
- Gary's going down.
- Yeah!

09:31.080 --> 09:33.958
Okay. We got the camera,
the lapel mike...

09:34.160 --> 09:36.515
...and the bullet-proof underwear.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.549
Hey, you didn't tell me
to bring any special underwear.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.718
Yours are already bullet-proof.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.872
Right. Hey, this spy stuff
makes me hungry.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.595
- Did you bring the Cheetos?
- No. Too crunchy.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.633
I brought gummy bears.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.391
This is the most humiliating thing
I have ever done.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.679
You obviously don't remember
your Little League tryouts.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.110
Is the sombrero-cam ready?

10:16.200 --> 10:22.150
Bud, go in there and get pictures of the
horrible, squalid working conditions.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.632
Go on, go on, go on.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.118
Keep it in your hat, Budro.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.993
Now, I'm wearing the wire.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.111
I'll get this guy
to incriminate himself.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.518
All right, all right. I'll go search
the office for damaging evidence.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.755
Jefferson.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.550
These two gummy bears are doing it.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.672
Hi. I'm Bob Thompson.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.634
Welcome to Happy Soles Footwear.
What can I do for you?

11:06.280 --> 11:09.397
- Gummy bear?
- Thank you.

11:10.480 --> 11:15.076
I have an underage worker for you.
Are you interested?

11:16.120 --> 11:18.509
So you would be interested...

11:18.720 --> 11:23.669
...in exploiting this child
in your highly illegal sweatshop.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.510
You wanna clarify that?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.711
He's nodding.

11:33.720 --> 11:38.510
Would you care to add anything before
we strike this highly illegal bargain?

11:38.720 --> 11:40.597
Yeah.
These bears appear to be doing it.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.791
I said that!

11:44.680 --> 11:47.069
- Hey!
- Who was that?

11:47.280 --> 11:50.955
<i>Why, that's Manny.
He's our VP of human resources.</i>

11:51.160 --> 11:53.594
He's in charge of orientation.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.998
That seemed a little harsh.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.556
Well, here's your finder's fee.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.919
Dad!

12:07.120 --> 12:10.430
Well, spare the prod, spoil the child.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.189
Hey, are you interested
in buying an older redhead?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.710
Now, she's not go a good worker,
but she's a good breeder.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.718
I wouldn't breed her,
but somebody could.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.434
We're full up.
A pleasure doing business with you.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.631
Yeah, you too. Hey, in the future...

12:24.840 --> 12:27.070
...if I should come here
for my sweatshop needs...

12:27.280 --> 12:30.352
...should I go directly to you
or to your boss...

12:30.560 --> 12:34.519
...Gary, from Gary's Shoes?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.109
Whatever.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.914
He said, "Whatever. "

12:39.440 --> 12:44.036
Al, Al, look at the slave wages
they pay these poor people.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.196
They make more than me!

12:47.640 --> 12:49.915
And they get gruel.

12:51.960 --> 12:57.910
Dad-o! Help-o! Lots of blood-o!

12:59.520 --> 13:02.990
You chuckleheads, this better be good.
I'm in the middle of a facial.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.794
Well, turn around.
Let's see how it's going.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.755
Look, we know you run a sweatshop.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.873
And we've got the proof.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.514
All right.
You caught me with my pants down.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.393
Hey, enough about your facial.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.952
Now, we have demands.
We want shorter working hours.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.357
Al, that means you'd have to spend
more time at home.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.755
We demand longer working hours.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.235
No, we don't. We want money.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.112
Okay, you got me over a barrel.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.470
Hey, who's blackmailing who, here?

13:36.640 --> 13:40.110
<i>What I'm saying is:
You can have anything you want.</i>

13:48.240 --> 13:51.198
Two hundred and fifty bucks.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.472
Each?

14:01.360 --> 14:03.032
Yes.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.509
I'll do it.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.070
- I'll bring you the money tomorrow.
- Today.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.957
Okay, but I'll have to miss
my electrolysis.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.438
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.111
It's almost ready.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.910
Mom. Mom, look at the clock.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.680
I think we're going backwards
in time.

14:30.880 --> 14:35.192
Well, maybe it can take us
back to before I met Al.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.914
Then I wouldn't have been born.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.516
Not necessarily.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.596
There's your Dad.
Hide the microwave.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.598
- Where?
- Put it on my side of the bed.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.553
Lord knows,
he'll never find anything there.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.591
Hold on.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.435
Now, now, Peg.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.837
Peg, I swear I smell food.

15:05.040 --> 15:08.430
Now, you haven't been eating around
on me behind my back, have you?

15:09.160 --> 15:12.391
Al, I can't even breathe
behind your back.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.835
Hey, what is that?
I heard a ding.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.035
Ringing in your ears.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.071
That's the second sign
of a brain tumour.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.508
You must be terminal.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.669
Peg, you don't have to cheer me up.
I've had a great day.

15:32.520 --> 15:37.071
Well, Marcy, congratulations.
I didn't know you were expecting.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.277
Peggy, my oven is on the fritz...

15:49.480 --> 15:52.153
...and I was hoping
you could warm my giblets.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.796
I thought that was your husband's
unfortunate job.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.713
No. It's my job to stuff the bird.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.315
You know, Al, there are so many things
that I could point out right now.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.149
Your receding hairline,
your depraved children-

16:13.360 --> 16:17.194
Your chronically unsatisfied wife.

16:17.720 --> 16:21.235
Thank you, Peggy,
but I just think I'll keep it simple.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.908
You're a shoe salesman.

16:24.800 --> 16:30.352
Make that
shoe salesman/extortionist.

16:30.960 --> 16:35.272
Al's boss runs an illegal sweatshop
and he's blackmailing her.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.234
Al Bundy,
I have never been so ashamed of you.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.749
Oh, except for last night.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.276
We'll just keep that
between ourselves...

16:44.480 --> 16:47.233
...which was something
you weren't able to do...

16:47.440 --> 16:50.671
...but let's not get into it, which
you know you also had trouble with.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.154
Okay, Peg.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.193
All right. I'm sorry, Al.
I won't bring it up again.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.231
Of course, up-

17:01.480 --> 17:04.676
Al Bundy,
you are a despicable human being.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.757
And you, Jefferson,
will be slaving away...

17:06.960 --> 17:09.792
...in your own little sweatshop
tonight.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.468
Well, Peg, since my ship came in,
I'm going out.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.240
I think I'll bowl a few frames.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.796
Honey, why don't you just
stay home and bowl me over?

17:24.160 --> 17:28.311
Because, Peg, I prefer a place
where my balls are returned properly.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.032
Hi, pumpkin.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.198
Hey, Daddy.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.990
What are you doing in the closet?

17:49.840 --> 17:54.550
This isn't the closet.
This is the... It's the elevator.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.598
Alrighty.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.077
Going up.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.673
Boy, this day just keeps getting
better and better.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.356
All right, beat this.

18:17.560 --> 18:22.554
Over the fountain, off the Gap sign...

18:22.760 --> 18:27.356
...and right into that woman grazing
the Hickory Barn sample bag.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.910
What do I get if I knock the salami
out of her mouth?

18:33.120 --> 18:35.429
A grateful salami.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.677
Hey, no fair banking it
off her forehead.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.472
Oh, my God. It's Gary.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.154
Which one of you morons
threw this shoe?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.918
- He did.
- He did.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.718
All right, you idiots.

18:53.920 --> 18:57.435
Here's your hush money.
Where's the evidence?

19:00.960 --> 19:02.279
Hey, this is fake money.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.517
There's no such thing
as a hundred dollar bill.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.513
Here they are.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.835
<i>This is Miranda Vera Cruz
de la Hoya Cardinale.</i>

19:15.640 --> 19:18.074
Thanks to news tipster,
Marcy D'Arcy...

19:18.280 --> 19:22.671
...we have just discovered that
Gary's Shoes uses sweatshop labour.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.711
And if that isn't bad enough...

19:24.920 --> 19:27.992
...these shoes are hideous
and poorly constructed.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.192
Speaking of hideous
and poorly-constructed...

19:31.400 --> 19:34.437
...meet Gary,
owner of Gary's sweatshop.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.279
You are the one
who's exploiting these children?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.311
What do you have to say
for yourself?

19:40.120 --> 19:42.350
You can say I'm ugly.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.156
You can say I'm untalented.

19:46.640 --> 19:51.509
But don't you dare say
I don't care about the children.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.594
Frank Gifford gave us more.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.837
That's my money. I blackmailed
that money, fair and square.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.359
Give up, Al.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.196
What about me, huh?
I'm exploited.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.278
I'm overworked, underpaid
and malnourished.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.948
I've got a brain tumour.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.318
<i>Al, three things. First:</i>

20:19.160 --> 20:23.278
Second, to have a brain tumour,
you have to have a brain.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.315
And third, this is not about you.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.354
This is about these poor,
victimized children.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.075
- Thank you, señora.
- Watch the hook, Paco.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.030
This is cashmere.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.431
Oh, thanks, idiots.
I couldn't buy publicity like this.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.915
- So you're gonna give us the raise?
- Forget it.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.078
Since I've been busted,
I'm cutting your salaries in half.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.794
Back to work, morons.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.435
You heard the man. Back to work.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.358
Across the Orange Julius...

20:59.560 --> 21:02.597
...to the Sunglass Hut,
to the NordicTrack store...

21:02.800 --> 21:06.076
...and right up
Gary's monkey-loving butt.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.712
What kind of trashy tramp
would wear these?

21:32.305 --> 21:38.310
