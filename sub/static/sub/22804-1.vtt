- Grandma! Grandpa!

00:14.900 --> 00:16.633
You have to see this!

00:16.700 --> 00:18.633
I found a map.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.367
A map...

00:20.433 --> 00:23.367
the key to finally finding
my missing parents.

Where are you?

both: Arnold!

01:43.833 --> 01:45.500
- Mom! Dad!

01:45.567 --> 01:48.067
- I can't believe
how much you've grown!

01:48.133 --> 01:50.067
- And you're still wearing
the hat we gave you.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.633
* *

01:52.700 --> 01:54.100
- Wait.

01:54.167 --> 01:56.867
I've been looking for you,
trying to find you.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.133
- I know.
What have we missed?

01:58.200 --> 01:59.733
- Show us the neighborhood.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.100
- What?

02:01.167 --> 02:03.100
[rumbling]

02:03.167 --> 02:04.700
This is really weird.

02:04.767 --> 02:06.100
Mom? Dad?

02:06.167 --> 02:07.433
both: Yes, Arnold?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.333
- You've been lost
for so long.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.767
I mean, I always believed
you were alive somehow,

02:12.833 --> 02:15.533
but...

02:15.600 --> 02:17.333
- Stella! Miles!

02:17.400 --> 02:19.967
I need you
for one last mission!

02:20.067 --> 02:21.200
- Wait!

02:21.267 --> 02:22.767
Where are you going?

02:22.833 --> 02:25.067
- We're off on another mission
with Eduardo!

02:25.067 --> 02:27.100
- No! Not again!

You know me so well,

short man.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.067
- Did you wash your hands?

03:16.067 --> 03:18.100
- I knew I forgot something.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.567
- Grandpa,
I had that dream again.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.233
- Oh?
What happened this time?

03:23.300 --> 03:24.933
- My parents were here--

03:25.067 --> 03:26.800
well, sort of--

03:26.867 --> 03:29.267
and it seemed like
they were gonna stay.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.167
- But then they left
on another mission.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.167
Oh, I'm sorry, Arnold.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.433
I miss them, too.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.067
But I'm glad
you get to see them,

03:37.100 --> 03:39.367
even if it's only in a dream.

03:39.433 --> 03:42.167
Oh, it's better than
the nightmare I keep having.

03:42.233 --> 03:44.633
I live in a run-down
old boarding house,

03:44.700 --> 03:47.900
renting my rooms
to a bunch of weirdos

03:47.967 --> 03:50.100
who always want things from me.

[plates shattering]

03:52.967 --> 03:54.133
- Hey, Gramps,
what's for breakfast?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.367
I'm starving here!

03:55.433 --> 03:56.667
Starving, do you hear me?

03:56.733 --> 03:57.800
- Imagine that.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.900
It's a living nightmare.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.700
- Make me a sandwich, old man.

04:01.767 --> 04:05.067
- Crispy fries and a tofu
burger for me, please,

04:05.133 --> 04:06.167
and step on it!

04:06.233 --> 04:07.767
- Hey, Arnold!

04:07.833 --> 04:09.933
Finally, someone
with some sense around here.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.200
- Hi, Ernie.
- Hey, Arnold.

04:11.267 --> 04:12.567
- Hi, Oskar.
- Hey, Arnold.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.200
Good to see you.
- Hi, Mr. Hyunh.

04:14.267 --> 04:17.867
- All power
to the working stiffs!

04:17.933 --> 04:20.433
All power to the proletariat!

04:20.500 --> 04:23.233
We demand a living wage!

04:23.300 --> 04:24.967
- Morning, Grandma.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.667
- Hello, dear.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.400
- You're not fooling anyone,
Pookie.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.900
Back in the kitchen.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.567
- [laughs]
Abner, I don't have any food.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.600
Oh, except this apple here.

- [sniffs]

04:35.833 --> 04:37.167

Bye, everyone.
Come on, Abner.

- Arnold, be well!

[animals chattering]

04:58.600 --> 05:01.200
- Hey, Arnold, ready
for the best day of school?

05:01.267 --> 05:02.667
- The best day, Gerald?

05:02.733 --> 05:04.500
- Yeah, today's the last day
of school.

05:04.567 --> 05:06.267
Therefore, by my calculations--

05:06.333 --> 05:08.500
- It's the best day.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.167
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:17.233 --> 05:18.200
Where do you two
think you're going?

05:18.267 --> 05:20.100
- School, dad, remember?

05:20.167 --> 05:21.733
Kids? School?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.267
The place we go to get away
from doofs like you?

05:24.333 --> 05:25.800
- Fine, go learn.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.067
Come right back
and help me sort beepers.

05:28.067 --> 05:29.600
- Didn't you get the memo, Bob?

05:29.667 --> 05:31.467
Nobody wants beepers anymore.

05:31.533 --> 05:34.200
Ever heard of cell phones?

05:34.267 --> 05:35.767
- It is true, Helga.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.067
A communication device
used to alert someone

05:38.133 --> 05:39.600
to make a phone call--

05:39.667 --> 05:42.067
a relic of
an obsolete technology.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.700
- I hate beepers.

05:43.767 --> 05:45.733
And the only thing that I can
kind of tolerate is--

05:45.800 --> 05:48.067
- Oof!
- Oh!

05:48.067 --> 05:49.267
Arnold!

05:49.333 --> 05:51.200
I mean, I said,

05:51.267 --> 05:53.600
everybody out of my way,
Hair Boy!

05:53.667 --> 05:55.367
Jeez!
What are you, blind?

05:55.433 --> 05:58.067
Don't you even know
how to not crash into people?

05:58.133 --> 06:01.100
- Got one more, Helga?

06:01.167 --> 06:02.400
- Ha! Yeah.

06:02.467 --> 06:04.200
Maybe you should get
walking lessons

06:04.267 --> 06:05.233
for your birthday, Arnold.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.467
- [chuckles]

06:06.533 --> 06:08.200
Whatever you say, Helga.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.900
- Ooh, good comeback,
Arnoldo.

06:10.967 --> 06:12.300

06:21.600 --> 06:24.067
I know you're all excited
about the last day of school,

06:24.133 --> 06:26.433
but get ready
for even more exciting news.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.467
- Is it that I can do...

06:27.533 --> 06:29.400
[muffled]
This?

06:31.233 --> 06:33.267
- No, it's not, Harold.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.967
Anyway, the news is,
we've been selected

06:36.067 --> 06:38.167
to compete in
a very special contest!

06:38.233 --> 06:40.433
A great humanitarian
organization

06:40.500 --> 06:42.700
in Central America
that helps the less fortunate

06:42.767 --> 06:43.967
is sponsoring it.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.500
They build habitats
that provide living space

06:46.567 --> 06:47.900
in the rainforest,

06:47.967 --> 06:50.167
and they want to
celebrate kids

06:50.233 --> 06:52.067
that exemplify their spirit.

06:52.067 --> 06:53.533
- Mr. Simmons?

06:53.600 --> 06:55.400
What do we have to do
to win the contest?

06:55.467 --> 06:57.133
- Excellent question, Phoebe.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.867
We submit a video presentation

06:58.933 --> 07:01.067
of our class
being humanitarians

07:01.067 --> 07:02.900
in our own neighborhood.

07:02.967 --> 07:04.067
- What's the prize?

07:04.067 --> 07:05.067
- Curly?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.400
[drumroll]

07:06.467 --> 07:08.300
A class trip

07:08.367 --> 07:10.400
to San Lorenzo!

07:10.467 --> 07:11.500
- San Lorenzo?

07:11.567 --> 07:13.333
The  San Lorenzo?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.333
- Is that the new
Mexican restaurant?

07:15.400 --> 07:18.067
- No, that place has been there
a while.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.533
- Close, Stinky.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.433
It's a beautiful, proud
republic to our south.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.100
This is where we'll go
if we win the contest.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.500
- To a Mexican restaurant!

07:27.567 --> 07:31.533
- No, to San Lorenzo,
the country,

07:31.600 --> 07:33.900
and the organization
that will host us

07:33.967 --> 07:36.067
is called
"Helpers For Humanity."

07:36.100 --> 07:38.167
- That was the group
my parents worked for.

07:38.233 --> 07:39.767
- And isn't it
the same San Lorenzo

07:39.833 --> 07:41.333
where your parents disappeared?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.967
It's almost like this contest

07:43.067 --> 07:44.200
is designed for you.

07:44.267 --> 07:45.667
- Quiet down, jerk-faces.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.133
I'm trying to concentrate
on the clock.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.900
- Class,
I know you're excited

07:49.967 --> 07:52.333
to get to work on
this video presentation,

07:52.400 --> 07:54.567
even though
it's the last day of school.

07:54.633 --> 07:55.833
[school bell rings]

07:55.900 --> 07:57.367
all:
School's out for summer!

07:57.433 --> 07:59.233
- I have a summer
of stuff to eat!

07:59.300 --> 08:02.067
- So long, suckers!

08:02.100 --> 08:03.067
- I'll do it.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.433
- I will, too.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.433
- Great!
We're on our way to winning.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.467
It's due in a week.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.600
[smooth jazz music]

08:11.667 --> 08:14.600
- Okay, we'll make
the best video ever.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.233
- We'll win this thing,
go to San Lorenzo,

08:17.300 --> 08:18.600
and find your lost parents.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.067
- Yeah, but the prize isn't

08:20.067 --> 08:22.200
a free trip for me
to go looking for them.

08:22.267 --> 08:25.167
- True, but how can you not
try to find your lost parents,

08:25.233 --> 08:27.967
especially since you've got
your best friend to help?

08:28.067 --> 08:29.333
- [laughs]
Okay.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.767
Let's win this contest.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.267
- And get you some answers.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.067
It'll be our secret.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.500
* *

08:36.567 --> 08:38.832
Now we just got to do something
humanitarian.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.267
- [humming] Monkeyman.
- I know.

08:41.332 --> 08:43.232
Let's build a habitat
for Monkeyman,

08:43.299 --> 08:45.167
right here on the river.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.500
- You're a bold kid, Arnold.

08:47.567 --> 08:54.800

09:21.867 --> 09:22.667
- Hey!

[seagull screeches]

09:30.133 --> 09:37.167

09:38.433 --> 09:40.833
- Where once was
a dirty urban riverbank,

09:40.900 --> 09:43.700
we've provided a comfortable
floating dwelling for one,

09:43.767 --> 09:46.100
as well as a habitat
for the local bird life.

09:46.167 --> 09:47.967
- Monkeyman!

09:48.067 --> 09:49.233
- Great, Arnold.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.767
Now I just shoot
some more angles

09:50.833 --> 09:52.933
of our awesome
completed habitat.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.933
- I was hoarding that!
- My tire collection!

09:55.067 --> 09:56.400
- I'm taking it all back!
- Thief! Thief!

09:56.467 --> 09:58.600
- They took my stuff!

09:58.667 --> 10:00.633
- That bird's my lunch!

10:01.567 --> 10:03.400
- No!

[all yelling]

10:09.500 --> 10:10.900
- Oh...

10:10.967 --> 10:16.467
- [stammering]
Monkeyman...

10:17.800 --> 10:21.200
- Hey, Arnold,
where are you going?

10:21.267 --> 10:24.133
- That was my last chance
to find my parents.

- Monkeyman!

11:11.167 --> 11:12.467
all: Monkeyman!

11:12.533 --> 11:14.267
- Give me the leg.
I like the dark meat.

11:17.733 --> 11:19.067
- Hey, sheesh, Arnoldo.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.967
Watch it.
Stop crashing into me.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.967
So, taking a walk
and thinking about

11:24.067 --> 11:26.100
how you've completely flopped
so far

11:26.167 --> 11:28.367
in winning
the San Lorenzo contest?

11:28.433 --> 11:29.667
Ha. This just in:

11:29.733 --> 11:31.233
you equals failure.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.967
- [squealing]

11:33.067 --> 11:35.600
- Actually, I was just kind of
thinking about my life,

11:35.667 --> 11:37.800
and how I haven't
seen my parents

11:37.867 --> 11:40.533
since I was a baby.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.200
I wish I could see them again.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.467
- Well, I--
that's news.

11:45.533 --> 11:49.333
I mean, if you wanted
to talk about...

11:49.400 --> 11:51.633
[stuttering]
F...

11:51.700 --> 11:53.333
[exhales]
F...

11:53.400 --> 11:54.667
feelings...

11:54.733 --> 11:56.700
- [angry squealing]

11:56.767 --> 11:58.433
- Sorry, Helga,
I think Abner's

11:58.500 --> 11:59.567
got to do a number two.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.367
See you.
Come on, Abner.

12:01.433 --> 12:02.700
[Abner squeals]

12:02.767 --> 12:04.533
- [groans]
Thwarted by a dirty,

12:04.600 --> 12:05.633
imbecilic pig.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.900
All I wanted to do

12:06.967 --> 12:08.600
is tell that stupid Arnold...

12:08.667 --> 12:10.867
[romantic music]

12:10.933 --> 12:12.533
That I'm here for him.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.967
I'm listening.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.933
I'm remembering
everything he says.

12:16.067 --> 12:19.567
Every deep thought,
every soul-searching utterance,

12:19.633 --> 12:22.467
yes, even every hem and haw!

12:22.533 --> 12:23.567
Arnold,

12:23.633 --> 12:25.200
I've tried to tell you,

12:25.267 --> 12:27.767
but you've yet to show me
that you've noticed,

12:27.833 --> 12:30.200
that you have feelings too,

12:30.267 --> 12:32.600
so I resort to
what I do best:

12:32.667 --> 12:35.467
being scorchingly mean!

12:35.533 --> 12:37.533
[playful music]

12:37.600 --> 12:40.133
Ow! Okay!

12:40.200 --> 12:41.500
I'll be kind...

12:41.567 --> 12:45.133
[sighs]
And understanding, and...

12:45.200 --> 12:48.233
- [wheezy breathing]

12:49.467 --> 12:50.633
[glasses shatter]

12:50.700 --> 12:52.200
[splashes]

12:52.267 --> 12:54.667
- Aha! If I help Arnold

12:54.733 --> 12:56.933
win that trip
to that crazy San Lorenzo

12:57.067 --> 12:58.400
and help him uncover
the mystery

12:58.467 --> 12:59.700
of his long-lost parents,

12:59.767 --> 13:01.933
maybe even find
the lost losers,

13:02.067 --> 13:05.667
then Arnold will be
eternally grateful

13:05.733 --> 13:08.667
and might even
return my love!

13:08.733 --> 13:12.700
It's win-win!
What a great plan! Whee!

13:15.867 --> 13:18.800
[dramatic music]

13:18.867 --> 13:26.100
* *

13:37.867 --> 13:40.467
- Phoebe, I need a hero video,
stat.

13:40.533 --> 13:41.800
- Right.

13:41.867 --> 13:46.100
Arnold tapes
155E, 17C, 101F.

13:46.167 --> 13:47.667
Pulling.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.733
- How does this thing--oh!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.800
* *

13:52.867 --> 13:54.300
- Hey, I think
he's starting to trust us.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.600
- Oh, that's right.

13:55.667 --> 13:56.733
Arnold even saved
that dumb turtle.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.300
- Don't worry, buddy.

13:58.367 --> 13:59.900
We're busting you out
of this joint.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.367
- He's helped half the city.

14:01.433 --> 14:03.067
I'll show those
fancy-pants judges

14:03.100 --> 14:04.733
why he's got to win!

14:04.800 --> 14:07.400
We're gonna need more,
but now I need someone

14:07.467 --> 14:09.600
to actually make something
out of all these.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.600
[smooth jazz]

14:12.667 --> 14:13.667
* *

14:13.733 --> 14:15.233
- Mm-mm-mm!

14:15.300 --> 14:17.633
This is an epic story
you're asking for, Helga.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.067
Where'd you get this footage?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.867
- Security cameras, okay?

14:20.933 --> 14:23.067
- Uh-huh,
all labeled and organized

14:23.100 --> 14:24.567
in perfect sequence.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.133
Whoa!
That's Arnold's bedroom.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.667
How'd you--
- Never mind.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.333
- Major creep factor aside,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.867
you know this footage is what
we need to win the contest.

14:31.933 --> 14:33.467
I thought you hated Arnold.

14:33.533 --> 14:35.300
Why are you suddenly
helping him?

14:35.367 --> 14:37.200
- Because...otherwise,
I'd have to watch

14:37.267 --> 14:39.733
that stupid football head
mope all summer!

14:39.800 --> 14:41.167
We've got to make
this video work

14:41.233 --> 14:43.633
so Arnold can get
to stupid San Lorenzo!

14:43.700 --> 14:46.067
It really matters to him, doi.

14:46.133 --> 14:47.267
You in?

14:47.333 --> 14:48.633
- Okay, I'm in,

14:48.700 --> 14:51.200
but only if you
get everybody to help.

14:51.267 --> 14:52.667
- No problem.

14:52.733 --> 14:55.367
They can just talk
to old Betsy here.

14:55.433 --> 14:57.667
- All right.
Let's do this.

14:57.733 --> 15:00.733
[melancholy music]

15:00.800 --> 15:08.067
* *

15:28.367 --> 15:31.067
- Well, that was
one long, sad walk.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.933
I almost rented your room out.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.933
- [sighs]
Hi, Grandpa.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.500
- Someone came to see you.

15:36.567 --> 15:37.767
They're up on the roof.

15:37.833 --> 15:38.767
- The roof?

15:38.833 --> 15:39.867
- I don't know.

15:39.933 --> 15:42.233
I just work here, short man.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.100
- Shh, shh.

15:45.167 --> 15:46.367
- [gasps]

15:46.433 --> 15:48.167
all: Surprise!

15:48.233 --> 15:52.433
Arnold! Arnold! Arnold!
Arnold!

15:52.500 --> 15:53.633
Arnold!

15:53.700 --> 15:55.433
- This is incredible.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.800
Everyone's here.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.633
- You better have a seat,
Arnold.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.767
- Why? What's going on?

16:00.833 --> 16:02.067
- Lights!

16:06.600 --> 16:09.133
- The legend of Arnold
will be passed down

16:09.200 --> 16:10.533
from kid generation

16:10.600 --> 16:12.100
to kid generation

16:12.167 --> 16:13.867
and onward,

16:13.933 --> 16:16.667
and Gerald is the keeper
of all legends,

16:16.733 --> 16:18.500
the teller of all tales.

16:18.567 --> 16:20.300
Take it away, Gerald.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.400
- [clears throat]

16:21.467 --> 16:22.900
We call him Arnold.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.533
Friend to all,
force for decency,

16:25.600 --> 16:26.867
doer of good.

16:26.933 --> 16:28.200
He's the most dependable,

16:28.267 --> 16:29.600
trusty, true-blue friend

16:29.667 --> 16:30.733
I can imagine.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.133
Help you in a second,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.067
no questions asked.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.933
And I know plenty of others
feel the same.

16:36.067 --> 16:39.467
Let's hear from some people
who Arnold has helped.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.700
- I would've never
left my stoop,

16:41.767 --> 16:43.900
and now look at me,
sitting on

16:43.967 --> 16:45.267
the biggest stoop in the city,

16:45.333 --> 16:47.833
and it's all because of
Arnold.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.067
Now I can harass people
from my stoop

16:50.133 --> 16:51.967
and from off my stoop!

16:52.067 --> 16:54.133
[laughs manically]

16:54.200 --> 16:56.967
Anyway, guy's got
a great heart.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.800
- He helped me
get over myself.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.933
Now I'm tolerant, gracious,
and self-effacing.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.167
Oh, and humble.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.200
I'll get a copy of this, right?

17:05.267 --> 17:06.833
- Arnold put me back together

17:06.900 --> 17:08.233
with my old partner, Don,

17:08.300 --> 17:09.767
and remade my career.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.333
I get applause from fans,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.867
but Arnold's the real star,
baby!

17:13.933 --> 17:16.567
- Arnold helped me escape
the cage

17:16.633 --> 17:18.666
of my old rooftop habitat.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.532
Now, I'm as free as a bird!

17:21.599 --> 17:24.067
Merci, Arnold.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.367
- Arnold listened to me
and treated me

17:25.433 --> 17:27.067
just like another friend.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.800
He's, you know,

17:28.867 --> 17:30.467
pure of heart.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.667
I'll never forget that,
Arnold.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.367
- I can inaudibly say

17:34.433 --> 17:36.267
that the over-esteemed Arnold

17:36.333 --> 17:39.333
put the "coach" back into
Coach Wittenberg.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.567
- I was a one-dimensional
bully

17:41.633 --> 17:45.067
until Arnold showed me
my sensitive side.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.400
- Arnold? Never heard of him.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.067
- Arnold almost killed me...
[crash]

17:50.100 --> 17:52.067
But then saved my life,

17:52.133 --> 17:53.700
got me a new fish,

17:53.767 --> 17:54.833
kept me from going bad!

17:54.900 --> 17:56.333
[motor revs]

17:56.400 --> 17:58.867
Thanks, Arnold.
What a pal!

17:58.933 --> 18:00.067
[pigeon coos]
Aah!

18:00.100 --> 18:01.533
[laughter]

18:01.600 --> 18:03.067
I'm okay!

18:03.067 --> 18:05.267
- Pure of heart.
That's Arnold.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.767
And that's why he deserves

18:06.833 --> 18:09.133
to win the trip to
San Lorenzo--

18:09.200 --> 18:11.167
because he's done
so much for others.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.667
He's a humanitarian,

18:12.733 --> 18:13.933
just like his parents

18:14.067 --> 18:15.567
and the Helpers for Humanity.

18:15.633 --> 18:17.533
- Monkeyman!

18:17.600 --> 18:18.833
- Hey, Arnold.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.100
You're a bold kid,

18:20.167 --> 18:21.900
and a true hero.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.800
* *

18:23.867 --> 18:25.267
- [laughs]

18:25.333 --> 18:28.567
[cheering, laughter]

18:30.933 --> 18:32.433
- Thank you all so much,

18:32.500 --> 18:35.067
but aren't we too late
to enter the contest?

18:35.067 --> 18:37.267
- I have wonderful news,
Arnold.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.267
Once the Helpers for Humanity
saw this video,

18:40.333 --> 18:42.667
we were immediately selected

18:42.733 --> 18:44.067
to go to San Lorenzo.

18:44.133 --> 18:46.467
That's right! We won!

18:46.533 --> 18:49.500
[all cheering]

18:50.467 --> 18:51.833
- Mm...

18:51.900 --> 18:53.633
- Never fear.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.900
I have every minute
planned out for this trip.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.300
Getting anyone lost

18:57.367 --> 18:59.667
is definitely not
on this agenda.

18:59.733 --> 19:01.133
- Mm-hmm.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.567
You ever travel
with a dozen kids before?

19:04.633 --> 19:06.833
- I know this video
wouldn't have happened

19:06.900 --> 19:08.067
without you, Gerald.

19:08.133 --> 19:09.400
I can't thank you enough.

19:09.467 --> 19:10.900
- You should thank Helga.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.300
This video was her idea.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.900
You should see
all the videos she has--

19:13.967 --> 19:15.667
- Of the things...

19:15.733 --> 19:16.700
around the city!

19:16.767 --> 19:17.700
Amazing.

19:17.767 --> 19:18.933
Anyway, it's done.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.600
We're going to San Lorenzo.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.067
- Wow, thank you, Helga.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.567
[electric buzzing]

19:24.633 --> 19:25.767
[romantic music]

19:25.833 --> 19:26.767
[fireworks bursting]

19:26.833 --> 19:28.333
- [sighs]

19:28.400 --> 19:29.200
And I...

19:29.267 --> 19:31.700
have to go wash my socks.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.567
- So that's the story:
a football-headed kid

19:34.633 --> 19:36.300
wins the contest...
- Whee!

19:36.367 --> 19:38.200
- And gets to go with
his whole class

19:38.267 --> 19:39.567
to the Central American
country

19:39.633 --> 19:40.833
of San Lorenzo.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.300
- Believe it or not...

19:42.367 --> 19:43.833
[sinister music]

19:43.900 --> 19:45.600
[computer beeping]

19:47.367 --> 19:50.600
- [maniacal laughter]

19:59.400 --> 20:01.100
- Well, short man,

20:01.167 --> 20:02.567
your passport's here.

20:02.633 --> 20:03.367
- All right!

20:03.433 --> 20:05.067
- Ah, ah, ah. Not yet.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.733
Now, Arnold, I'm still worried
about you taking this trip.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.200
Remember all the trouble
your parents got into

20:10.267 --> 20:12.867
with that evil river pirate
Lasombra?

20:12.933 --> 20:14.533
[sighs]
That was practically

20:14.600 --> 20:18.100
the last time we heard
from them.

20:18.167 --> 20:19.700
Oh, fine.

20:19.767 --> 20:21.767
Don't forget to sign it
with your name

20:21.833 --> 20:24.100
as it appears
on your birth certificate.

20:24.167 --> 20:28.400
- Arnold Shortman.

20:29.567 --> 20:32.400
Grandpa, San Lorenzo
is a big country.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.233
I'm not going to look for
this Lasombra guy

20:35.300 --> 20:37.100
and I doubt if
I'm gonna run into him.

20:37.167 --> 20:38.500
- [scoffs]
Let's hope not!

20:38.567 --> 20:40.300
This is just a school trip

20:40.367 --> 20:41.733
to visit the rainforest,

20:41.800 --> 20:44.100
not about you
finding your parents.

20:44.167 --> 20:45.533
- Don't worry, Grandpa.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.667
I'll stick with my class
the whole time,

20:47.733 --> 20:50.000
but since I'll be
in San Lorenzo,

20:50.067 --> 20:52.200
I have to at least
look up Eduardo.

20:52.267 --> 20:53.967
He was my mom and dad's
best friend.

20:54.033 --> 20:57.633
- [sighs] Well,
you could at least do that.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.800
[trumpet blares]

20:59.867 --> 21:02.900
- Venture forth
armed with this, Kimba.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.433
- Pookie!

21:04.500 --> 21:06.933
Arnold will never get
a handmade blowpipe

21:07.067 --> 21:08.167
through security.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.533
Oh, and...

21:10.600 --> 21:12.867
Here, short man.
Take this instead.

21:12.933 --> 21:14.833
It'll remind you of home.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.900
- Um...

21:15.967 --> 21:17.967
thanks?

21:18.067 --> 21:20.433
both: Just be careful, Arnold.

21:20.500 --> 21:24.067
[upbeat music]

21:24.100 --> 21:27.067
- That sure is
a lot of luggage, Miss Rhonda.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.067
- One bag for every day
of the trip.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.967
That's how I pack.

21:31.067 --> 21:32.433
* *

21:32.500 --> 21:34.233
- Harold, why do you have
a deli platter?

21:34.300 --> 21:35.667
- My mom gave me this

21:35.733 --> 21:37.867
in case there's no food
in San Lorenzo.

21:37.933 --> 21:40.100
- There's plenty of food there,
Harold.

21:40.167 --> 21:41.833
No platter necessary.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.100
- No platter?

21:44.167 --> 21:46.400
* *

21:46.467 --> 21:48.333
[crashing,
cat yowling]

21:48.400 --> 21:50.733
[playful music]

21:50.800 --> 21:52.867
- Oh, Arnold,

21:52.933 --> 21:55.200
though on the outside
I appear to hate the idea

21:55.267 --> 21:57.733
of going to some godforsaken
jungle with you,

21:57.800 --> 21:59.533
'tis merely a guise!

21:59.600 --> 22:01.967
I'll help you find
your long-lost parents

22:02.067 --> 22:03.633
and just maybe...

22:03.700 --> 22:07.333
- [gasps]
- Surprise, baby sister!

22:07.400 --> 22:09.767
I'm coming along
on your San Lorenzo trip

22:09.833 --> 22:12.933
as the student teacher-slash-
chaperone.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.233
Goody!

22:14.300 --> 22:15.400
- Are you kidding me?

22:15.467 --> 22:17.133
This is the worst news ever!

22:17.200 --> 22:18.600
- I'm worried about your safety

22:18.667 --> 22:20.400
in this St. Lawrence place,
Olga.

22:20.467 --> 22:23.067
- I'll be fine.
Thanks, Bob.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.367
- Oh, good, you're here.

22:24.433 --> 22:26.067
Take this bag of beepers
with you

22:26.133 --> 22:27.333
and sell them to the locals.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.433
- Arnold.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.700
You're going to the jungle,

22:30.767 --> 22:33.133
so don't catch
any tropical diseases

22:33.200 --> 22:34.267
like malaria,

22:34.333 --> 22:35.733
or diphtheria,

22:35.800 --> 22:36.833
or cholera,

22:36.900 --> 22:37.833
or yellow fever,

22:37.900 --> 22:38.900
or hookworm,

22:38.967 --> 22:40.067
or elephantiasis,

22:40.100 --> 22:41.133
or leprosy,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.233
or tennis elbow!

22:42.300 --> 22:46.067
[exciting music]

22:46.100 --> 22:47.900
- Ah!
- Or itchy armpits!

22:47.967 --> 22:49.067
Or boom boom fever

22:49.100 --> 22:50.800
or Aulder's neck rash!

22:50.867 --> 22:52.433
- Hey! Crazy lady!

22:52.500 --> 22:53.933
Get out of my stair truck!

22:54.067 --> 22:55.700
- [cackling]

22:55.767 --> 22:59.767
- Or Palmer's knee,
or Borneo's disease!

22:59.833 --> 23:02.367
Or--I don't know,
athlete's foot!

23:02.433 --> 23:06.067
- You know, I'm really gonna
miss Grandma and Grandpa.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.367
- [squeals]
- Abner!

23:11.433 --> 23:12.933
What are you doing here?

23:13.067 --> 23:14.500
- [squeals happily]

23:14.567 --> 23:16.100
- Guess your grandpa
wasn't gonna let you

23:16.167 --> 23:17.400
leave your pig behind, Arnold.

23:17.467 --> 23:18.733
- [laughs]

23:18.800 --> 23:21.133
Yep.
I guess we've got a stowaway.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.133
[percussive music]

23:24.200 --> 23:31.433
* *

23:35.633 --> 23:38.100
- [screams]
My hair!

23:38.167 --> 23:39.733
- You know what they say,
Rhonda.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.100
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.733
- Class, let's stay together
while we explore

23:44.800 --> 23:47.067
and then go to the river docks
at 3:00 p.m.,

23:47.067 --> 23:49.567
then it's on the boat, and--
[children yelling]

23:49.633 --> 23:52.567
Stop!
Running is not on the agenda!

23:52.633 --> 23:54.300
River docks at 3:00!

23:54.367 --> 23:55.633
* *

23:55.700 --> 23:57.133
- Come on, baby sister!

23:57.200 --> 24:01.833
* *

24:01.900 --> 24:03.267
- [squeals]

24:03.333 --> 24:07.300
* *

24:07.367 --> 24:09.467
- [screams]
Ugh.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.933
- Miss me?
- Ugh!

24:14.200 --> 24:16.833
- Well, Arnold,
we made it to San Lorenzo.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.833
So, where do we start
looking for your parents?

24:18.900 --> 24:21.300
- Sorry, Gerald, I promised
Grandpa I wouldn't,

24:21.367 --> 24:24.900
but he did say I could find
their best friend, Eduardo.

24:24.967 --> 24:26.100
[horn honking]

24:27.367 --> 24:30.567
I found this old envelope
with Eduardo's address on it.

24:30.633 --> 24:33.567
[tense music]

24:33.633 --> 24:35.067
Here it is.

24:36.133 --> 24:38.200
[knocks on door]

24:38.267 --> 24:39.500
- Whoa.

24:41.133 --> 24:42.167
- What happened?

24:42.233 --> 24:43.700
[television blares]

24:43.767 --> 24:45.400
It looks like Eduardo
kind of left in a hurry.

24:45.467 --> 24:48.067
- [sniffs]

24:48.100 --> 24:50.600
[anxious squealing]

24:50.667 --> 24:52.600
- Abner, what is it, boy?

24:52.667 --> 24:54.233
- I don't know
what's bugging Abner,

24:54.300 --> 24:56.167
but we better get back
and meet Simmons, Arnold.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.333
We can't miss the boat.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.400
[crowd cheering]

25:00.467 --> 25:06.300
* *

25:06.367 --> 25:07.900
- Hello! Welcome!

25:07.967 --> 25:11.500
You must be Mr. Simmons
and your PS 118 class.

25:11.567 --> 25:13.200
My name is Eduardo.

25:13.267 --> 25:14.600
all: Hi, Eduardo.

25:14.667 --> 25:15.967
both: Eduardo?

25:16.067 --> 25:17.100
- [gasps]

25:17.167 --> 25:18.267
Arnold.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.467
Could it be?

25:19.533 --> 25:21.233
Arnold, it's me,

25:21.300 --> 25:22.500
your parents' best friend.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.367
Qué buena fortuna.

25:24.433 --> 25:26.067
I am the captain
of this boat,

25:26.133 --> 25:27.900
and I will take you
up the river to the rainforest.

25:27.967 --> 25:29.800
We'll go straight
to the habitat

25:29.867 --> 25:32.267
that my group,
Helpers for Humanity, made.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.867
- Yes, like my parents.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.333
- Of course.
We all worked together.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.800
- Hi, I'm Gerald.
What a relief.

25:37.867 --> 25:39.067
We thought something bad--

25:39.067 --> 25:40.300
- Captain Eddie?

25:40.367 --> 25:41.533
Is there a toilet
on this boat?

25:41.600 --> 25:42.533
- Of course, of course,

25:42.600 --> 25:43.700
disculpe.

25:43.767 --> 25:44.767
Where are my manners?

25:44.833 --> 25:46.067
Everyone, all aboard!

25:46.100 --> 25:47.833
[all cheering]

25:47.900 --> 25:49.800
- We're on the boat,
we're on schedule...

25:49.867 --> 25:52.067
The captain even knows Arnold.

25:52.100 --> 25:53.600
This'll be a perfect trip.

25:53.667 --> 25:56.067
- I couldn't agree more,
Mr. Simmons.

25:56.067 --> 25:58.433
- I want to introduce
my crew.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.367
This is Paolo.
- Hey.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.933
- Steve.
- Hola.

26:02.067 --> 26:02.967
- And Che.

26:03.067 --> 26:06.167
[bright Latin rhythm music]

26:06.233 --> 26:07.700
- Oh!

26:07.767 --> 26:10.233
- Everybody loves Olga.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.733
[whistle blows]

26:11.800 --> 26:14.700
* *

26:16.300 --> 26:19.767
- I still can't believe I'm in
San Lorenzo with you, Eduardo.

26:19.833 --> 26:22.567
- Is it fate?
Who knows?

26:22.633 --> 26:24.667
- Eduardo, I have to know:

26:24.733 --> 26:26.300
where are my parents?

26:26.367 --> 26:27.633
Are they alive?

26:27.700 --> 26:29.367
- Ah, qué lástima.

26:29.433 --> 26:33.833
That's a mystery I have not
yet solved either, amigo.

26:33.900 --> 26:37.333
But I bet you'd like to hear
my stories of your parents.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.633
- Yes, please!

26:38.700 --> 26:40.233
- Ha! Let's see.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.900
Eh, your father...

26:41.967 --> 26:45.333
was always bumping into things
and breaking them.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.500
I think the first three times
he met your mother,

26:47.567 --> 26:48.700
he broke something.

26:48.767 --> 26:50.800
[laughs]
His arm, his head...

26:50.867 --> 26:52.567
[laughs]

26:52.633 --> 26:54.333
They were both
my best friends.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.333
[tranquil music]

26:57.400 --> 26:58.767
* *

26:58.833 --> 27:02.867
[haunting pipe music]

27:02.933 --> 27:05.867
Your father would want you
to have this.

27:05.933 --> 27:08.633
It was a gift to him
from the Green-Eyed People.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.067
You know,

27:10.100 --> 27:12.300
they helped each other
many times.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.600
- Huh?

27:15.333 --> 27:16.700
- Ay, qué--

27:16.767 --> 27:19.567
I've never seen
this happen before.

27:19.633 --> 27:22.233
You truly must be chosen,
Arnold,

27:22.300 --> 27:24.067
chosen by the Green-Eyes.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.900
Surely you know that
when you were born,

27:25.967 --> 27:28.133
that you silenced
the erupting volcano,

27:28.200 --> 27:29.367
Volcán Turriable?

27:29.433 --> 27:30.600
- It was in my dad's journal.

27:30.667 --> 27:32.467
- The Green-Eyes saw that, too.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.100
It fulfilled a prophecy.

27:34.167 --> 27:35.933
* *

27:36.067 --> 27:38.067
Maybe when we are upriver,

27:38.100 --> 27:39.533
we--you and me--

27:39.600 --> 27:41.633
we will find
the Green-Eyed People.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.133
Maybe they will know
the answer

27:43.200 --> 27:45.233
to the mystery
of your parents.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.533
- Hey, Arnold.
It's buffet time.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.733
- I, uh...

27:49.800 --> 27:51.667
- Go on, play, Arnold, play.

27:51.733 --> 27:53.533
Friends should be
with friends.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.833
* *

27:56.900 --> 27:58.600
- I love buff-ets!

27:58.667 --> 28:01.067
- Ooh, pitaya!

28:04.067 --> 28:04.967
[laughs]

28:05.067 --> 28:06.833
Well, I guess I'll add pitaya

28:06.900 --> 28:09.067
to my allergy list.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.567
- I finished all
the deli sandwiches,

28:11.633 --> 28:14.433
the carne con whiskers...

28:14.500 --> 28:16.133
Ooh!

28:16.200 --> 28:18.300
Ah!
[stomach rumbling]

28:18.367 --> 28:19.500
Hmm!

28:19.567 --> 28:22.333
Clear the bathroom! Emergency!

28:22.400 --> 28:23.333
Kill me now!

28:23.400 --> 28:24.600
- [giggles]

28:24.667 --> 28:26.767
- Man, Olga makes it look
so easy.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.167
What's her secret?

28:28.233 --> 28:31.233
Besides being pretty
and charming and nice.

28:31.300 --> 28:34.700
- I'm queen of the world!

28:34.767 --> 28:35.933
- [gags]

28:36.067 --> 28:37.133
Time to feed the fish!

28:37.200 --> 28:39.100
- Hey, ocupado!

28:43.400 --> 28:45.633
- Hey, Eduardo.
What are you looking at?

28:45.700 --> 28:48.333
- Oh, nothing, Arnold, nothing.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.900
But this is the jungle,

28:49.967 --> 28:53.600
and you must always be aware
of the dangers here.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.667
- Like Lasombra?

28:56.733 --> 28:58.267
* *

28:58.333 --> 29:01.567
- So, you've heard about
the infamous Lasombra?

29:01.633 --> 29:03.233
He was not happy
that your parents

29:03.300 --> 29:05.067
stole back from him
a precious treasure

29:05.067 --> 29:06.533
called the Corazón.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.867
- Is he after me?
We're in danger, aren't we?

29:08.933 --> 29:11.733
- We could turn around
and head back to safety,

29:11.800 --> 29:14.167
or we can continue ahead,

29:14.233 --> 29:15.133
and maybe

29:15.200 --> 29:17.067
find out about your parents.

29:17.133 --> 29:18.800
- What?

29:19.667 --> 29:22.067
But I promised...

29:22.100 --> 29:22.933
No.

29:23.067 --> 29:24.333
With you to protect us,

29:24.400 --> 29:26.400
we keep going.

29:26.467 --> 29:29.667
- Now, don't tell the others
what we spoke about.

29:29.733 --> 29:33.267
I don't want
to worry anyone.

29:37.333 --> 29:40.367
[haunting music]

29:40.433 --> 29:41.700
- Anything wrong, Arnold?

29:41.767 --> 29:43.433
- Uh, nothing.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.167
Everything's fine.

29:45.233 --> 29:46.567
- Come on, man.

29:46.633 --> 29:48.067
There's no secrets with us,
right?

29:48.100 --> 29:49.433
And now you've got
some secret

29:49.500 --> 29:50.800
with this guy you just met?

29:50.867 --> 29:55.067
* *

29:55.067 --> 29:55.800
Fine.

29:55.867 --> 30:03.100
* *

30:10.500 --> 30:12.733
- [exhales]

30:16.333 --> 30:18.633
Arnold, what a surprise.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.533
I came up here to think

30:20.600 --> 30:23.233
about life and stuff.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.800
- Yeah, me too.

30:27.867 --> 30:31.033
- So...up here,
staring into the night,

30:31.100 --> 30:33.167
trying to figure out
how to tell me something, huh?

30:33.233 --> 30:35.600
* *

30:35.667 --> 30:37.667
- [sighs]
Well, actually,

30:37.733 --> 30:39.533
I do have something
to confess.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.733
- Confess?
Like a confession?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.367
Like a deep-seated secret

30:43.433 --> 30:45.433
you've been harboring
and haven't told me?

30:45.500 --> 30:46.633
- Yeah.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.100
You ever feel like

30:48.167 --> 30:49.500
there's a hole in your heart?

30:49.567 --> 30:51.933
- Yes.
All the time.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.767
- This whole trip's
been about one thing.

30:54.833 --> 30:56.700
I want to find
my lost parents.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.300
I feel like I'm about
to put us all in--

30:58.367 --> 31:00.233
- Yeah, yeah, I know
all about your parents.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.467
How do you feel about me?
- Huh?

31:02.533 --> 31:05.067
- You wouldn't even
be here without me.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.767
Oh, Arnold, I may act
like I don't care,

31:06.833 --> 31:08.500
I may even say
I hate you,

31:08.567 --> 31:09.800
but that's a cover.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.700
I actually do care about you.

31:11.767 --> 31:13.567
- Huh?
- Don't play dumb, Arnold.

31:13.633 --> 31:15.067
You know
what I'm talking about.

31:15.067 --> 31:16.433
You're like some
weird old wise man,

31:16.500 --> 31:17.733
for crying out loud.

31:17.800 --> 31:18.833
I know you can
handle the truth,

31:18.900 --> 31:20.067
and I can, too.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.400
- What are you talking about?

31:21.467 --> 31:23.133
- I'm talking about the fact

31:23.200 --> 31:25.667
that I really like you, Arnold,

31:25.733 --> 31:28.600
like thunder likes lightning,

31:28.667 --> 31:31.267
like faces like fists.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.167
You know, like-like.

31:33.233 --> 31:35.900
In fact, I lo--
- Uh-oh.

31:35.967 --> 31:37.100
There's a boat coming.

31:37.167 --> 31:39.267
[sinister musical tone]

31:41.567 --> 31:44.800
- [screaming]

31:45.867 --> 31:48.800
[dramatic music]

31:48.867 --> 31:56.100
* *

32:11.100 --> 32:14.900
- [wheezy breathing]

32:18.300 --> 32:19.233
- Eduardo!

32:19.300 --> 32:21.800
* *

32:21.867 --> 32:24.800
- [sniffing, snorting]

32:24.867 --> 32:28.100
[distressed squealing]

32:29.767 --> 32:33.067
* *

32:33.133 --> 32:34.167
[splash]

32:34.233 --> 32:35.067
- Eduardo!

32:35.133 --> 32:36.800
[panting]
There's...

32:36.867 --> 32:37.900
a ship.

32:37.967 --> 32:39.533
[dramatic musical tone]

32:39.600 --> 32:42.833
[people shouting]

32:50.067 --> 32:52.067
- Arnold, it's Lasombra.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.067
- I knew it!
What are we going to do?

32:54.100 --> 32:55.333
- We'll fight back
and get away.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.067
Stay down where they
cannot see you!

32:57.100 --> 32:58.500
- But what about my friends?

32:58.567 --> 32:59.733
- Forget them!

32:59.800 --> 33:03.100
[shouting, swords clashing]

33:04.800 --> 33:06.567
- Oh, dear, a pirate attack?

33:06.633 --> 33:07.733
Not on the agenda.

33:07.800 --> 33:13.100
* *

33:13.167 --> 33:15.733
[dramatic choral music]

33:15.800 --> 33:17.500
- Fight hard, Che!
[squeals]

33:17.567 --> 33:18.800
But don't hurt
your runway-quality

33:18.867 --> 33:20.633
chiseled face!

33:20.700 --> 33:23.633
[dramatic music]

33:23.700 --> 33:27.800
* *

33:27.867 --> 33:30.633
- Hold on tight, amigo.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.067
[engine revs]

33:32.067 --> 33:33.533
Yes, my friend.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.233
I'm changing course down
the Río De Oscuridad.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.567
It has tricky
and dangerous rapids.

33:38.633 --> 33:40.100
He wouldn't dare to follow.

33:40.167 --> 33:43.300
[all screaming]

33:43.367 --> 33:50.367
* *

33:50.967 --> 33:53.567
- Ugh! Who booked this?

33:53.633 --> 33:54.933
- Bueno.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.067
Lasombra may be
a ruthless river pirate,

33:57.133 --> 33:58.433
but he's not crazy--

33:58.500 --> 34:00.367
no, far from it.

34:00.433 --> 34:02.133
* *

34:02.200 --> 34:05.133
[all screaming]

34:05.200 --> 34:06.567
* *

34:06.633 --> 34:07.800
- Whoop!
There we go.

34:07.867 --> 34:09.067
Whoop!
Down again.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.967
[laughs]
Oh, this is so fun!

34:11.067 --> 34:17.967
* *

34:18.067 --> 34:19.632
- Aah!
- Hold on, Helga!

34:19.699 --> 34:21.833
- Can this get any worse?

34:21.900 --> 34:24.867
* *

34:24.933 --> 34:26.933
- Hold on tight!

34:27.067 --> 34:29.933
[all screaming]

34:30.067 --> 34:37.233
* *

34:38.967 --> 34:42.132
[screaming]

34:44.167 --> 34:46.733
- I'm okay.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.867
- Everyone!

34:47.933 --> 34:49.400
Abandon ship!

34:52.833 --> 34:55.132
- Abner! Abner!

34:55.199 --> 34:56.567
[camera shutter clicks]

34:56.632 --> 34:57.933
Here, boy!

34:58.067 --> 34:59.333
Where are you?

34:59.400 --> 35:00.700
- So...

35:00.767 --> 35:02.200
who's starving?

35:02.267 --> 35:05.067
- Oh, I have snacks
in my other luggage.

35:05.067 --> 35:06.633
I'll just go back
and get them.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.567
Or not.

35:10.633 --> 35:12.533
- Now, friends,
let me explain

35:12.600 --> 35:14.067
what has just happened
back there.

35:14.067 --> 35:16.333
- A thrilling classic
chase scene!

35:16.400 --> 35:18.667
And now we're shipwrecked
and lost!

35:18.733 --> 35:19.667
- Untrue.

35:19.733 --> 35:20.733
We have escaped

35:20.800 --> 35:22.167
an unexpected attack,

35:22.233 --> 35:24.067
and yes, our boat
is unfortunately wrecked,

35:24.100 --> 35:25.600
but there's good news.

35:25.667 --> 35:26.800
We are not lost.

35:26.867 --> 35:28.067
We can hike from here

35:28.067 --> 35:29.433
to our jungle habitat,

35:29.500 --> 35:30.667
a safe place.

35:30.733 --> 35:32.933
- Is the habitat
a short walk from here?

35:33.067 --> 35:33.967
- Oh, no.

35:34.067 --> 35:35.333
No, it's many, many,

35:35.400 --> 35:37.367
many miles,
over rough trails...

35:37.433 --> 35:39.900
- Oh, that is such bad news.

35:39.967 --> 35:41.233
- Through steep,
muddy jungle...

35:41.300 --> 35:42.700
- Ugh, just got worse.

35:42.767 --> 35:43.833
- But then it smooths out...

35:43.900 --> 35:45.233
[all gasp excitedly]

35:45.300 --> 35:47.067
- And becomes
an enormous swamp.

35:47.067 --> 35:48.533
[all groan]

35:48.600 --> 35:50.067
[sharp whistle]

35:50.100 --> 35:52.500
- Okay, I demand
an explanation, mister.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.600
What really happened
back there?

35:54.667 --> 35:56.100
Who attacked us and why?

35:56.167 --> 35:58.433
- We were attacked
by river pirates.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.867
Their leader is called
Lasombra.

36:00.933 --> 36:03.100
He is after Arnold.

36:03.167 --> 36:04.400
[confused chatter]

36:04.467 --> 36:05.533
- [gasps]

36:05.600 --> 36:06.767
- Who's that?

36:06.833 --> 36:09.333
- Why is this Lasombra
after Arnold?

36:09.400 --> 36:10.967
- That is Arnold's business.

36:11.067 --> 36:14.167
Let's get going.
Vámonos.

36:14.233 --> 36:16.133
- We didn't sign up for this,
Arnold,

36:16.200 --> 36:17.800
but you knew that already.

36:17.867 --> 36:19.733
Now we're literally
up the river

36:19.800 --> 36:21.067
without a stinking paddle!

36:21.133 --> 36:22.700
- No, no fighting,
no fighting.

36:22.767 --> 36:25.300
We have one big job
to do now, friends: to walk.

36:25.367 --> 36:26.733
We can do this.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.067
And take only what you need.

36:29.133 --> 36:32.067
[militaristic march]

36:32.133 --> 36:39.367
* *

36:45.167 --> 36:46.867
- Oof!

36:46.933 --> 36:48.800
- [blows raspberry]

36:48.867 --> 36:55.900
* *

36:56.433 --> 36:58.233
- Oh, gross! Get it off!

36:58.300 --> 36:59.667
Oh, I think it bit me.
[screams]

36:59.733 --> 37:01.867
- Ooh!
[gasps]

37:01.933 --> 37:02.967
It's like Christmas.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.800
[thunder booms]

37:04.867 --> 37:11.900
* *

37:21.367 --> 37:23.933
- My Beatle boots!

37:24.067 --> 37:26.100
[sobs]

37:26.167 --> 37:29.200
* *

37:29.267 --> 37:31.300
- [gasps]
I see the habitat!

37:31.367 --> 37:34.667
[all cheering]

37:34.733 --> 37:37.667
[hopeful music]

37:37.733 --> 37:38.833
- We're safe!

37:38.900 --> 37:40.067
Thank you, Eduardo.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.167
- Vámonos, amigos.

37:41.233 --> 37:42.933
You can rest and dry out

37:43.067 --> 37:44.233
and have a hot dinner.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.700
[excited cheering]

37:46.767 --> 37:47.967
- I'm starving!

37:48.067 --> 37:51.267
[cheering]

37:52.667 --> 37:54.933
- [munching]

37:55.067 --> 37:56.533
- We're back on schedule.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.567
- Yeah, I guess
it all worked out.

37:58.633 --> 37:59.900
- Um, eh...

38:00.067 --> 38:02.067
may I have your attention?

38:02.067 --> 38:05.367
There's been a misunderstanding
which I would like to correct.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.400
I am not Eduardo.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.233
[unsettling music]

38:09.300 --> 38:10.933
I am Lasombra.

38:11.067 --> 38:12.133
[all gasp]

38:12.200 --> 38:14.900
And you are now my prisoners.

38:14.967 --> 38:16.800
* *

38:16.867 --> 38:18.633
- No!

38:18.700 --> 38:20.567
- And you will remain
my prisoners

38:20.633 --> 38:22.533
until this football-headed boy

38:22.600 --> 38:26.133
shows me where to find
the Corazón.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.967
* *

38:31.567 --> 38:32.733
- Thank you, all of you,

38:32.800 --> 38:35.167
for walking right into my trap.

38:35.233 --> 38:36.767
- How could you?

38:36.833 --> 38:38.067
- Easy. See?

38:38.100 --> 38:39.467
Eduardo, Lasombra.

38:39.533 --> 38:40.867
Eduardo, Lasombra.

38:40.933 --> 38:43.300
Abraham Lincoln,
Frida Kahlo. Easy.

38:43.367 --> 38:45.967
- Yeah, that's hilarious,
La Bozo,

38:46.067 --> 38:47.367
but I'm Helga G. Pataki,

38:47.433 --> 38:49.100
and I'm not staying!

38:49.167 --> 38:50.867
So if you'll just
open the gate,

38:50.933 --> 38:52.067
we'll be on our way.

38:52.133 --> 38:53.567
- You are staying.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.467
I went to the trouble
to arrange

38:55.533 --> 38:57.267
that whole phony contest
and class trip

38:57.333 --> 39:00.200
just to lure Arnold here.

39:00.267 --> 39:02.533
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I have a question.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.433
Does this dump get Wi-Fi?

39:04.500 --> 39:05.833
- Yes.
- [excited gasp]

39:05.900 --> 39:07.200
- But I'm not giving you
the password.

39:07.267 --> 39:09.367
- You monster!

39:09.433 --> 39:10.867
- How did you guess?

39:10.933 --> 39:12.833
Go change it
to the other password!

39:12.900 --> 39:14.867
And don't forget
to write it down this time!

39:14.933 --> 39:17.600
- Okay, Lasombra,
you have me now.

39:17.667 --> 39:19.233
You can let my friends go.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.633
- Arnold, come on,
don't be mad.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.533
You're my partner, remember?

39:23.600 --> 39:24.667
Our secret?

39:24.733 --> 39:26.433
[unsettling music]

39:26.500 --> 39:29.533
- Partner? What secret
is he talking about?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.500
- No! I mean, he--

39:31.567 --> 39:33.233
- Oh, Arnold didn't tell you?

39:33.300 --> 39:36.367
We planned to go look for
his precious Green-Eyed People.

39:36.433 --> 39:37.800
all: Green-Eyed People?

39:37.867 --> 39:39.900
- No, no, he's twisting it
all up.

39:39.967 --> 39:42.533
I thought maybe
if we found the Green-Eyes,

39:42.600 --> 39:44.367
they could tell me
where my parents are.

39:44.433 --> 39:46.767
- Arnold, say it ain't so.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.367
You weren't actually
helping this jamoke?

39:49.433 --> 39:51.467
- I knew it!
Why didn't you just tell me?

39:51.533 --> 39:52.800
- I'm sorry, Gerald.

39:52.867 --> 39:54.733
- You've gone Benedict, Arnold.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.400
Benedict Arnold was a general

39:56.467 --> 39:57.633
who defected to the other si--

39:57.700 --> 39:59.667
all: We know, Simmons!

39:59.733 --> 40:00.500
- Sheesh!

40:00.567 --> 40:01.667
So what's so great about

40:01.733 --> 40:03.167
this mega-doofus, anyway?

40:03.233 --> 40:04.900
- The ancient Green-Eyes
foretold

40:04.967 --> 40:07.900
that a child of the volcano
will save them,

40:07.967 --> 40:09.567
and they believe Arnold
to be that child.

40:09.633 --> 40:11.533
For years, I have sought after

40:11.600 --> 40:14.200
the mysterious Green-Eyes
to get my hands on

40:14.267 --> 40:16.567
their even more mysterious
Corazón.

40:16.633 --> 40:19.100
- Corazón.
Translation: heart.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.467
- With him by my side,
the Green-Eyes are sure

40:21.533 --> 40:23.133
to show themselves to me.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.933
* *

40:25.000 --> 40:26.900
As you see,
I've made a career

40:26.967 --> 40:29.167
of stealing and selling
all that is precious

40:29.233 --> 40:30.467
in Central America,

40:30.533 --> 40:32.800
but one treasure
still eludes me:

40:32.867 --> 40:33.833
the Corazón.

40:33.900 --> 40:34.767
- Psst!

40:34.833 --> 40:36.500
Do you need an inside man?

40:36.567 --> 40:38.200
I can be the camp snitch.

40:38.267 --> 40:39.367
Wink.

40:39.433 --> 40:40.800
- Sorry, kid.

40:40.867 --> 40:42.800
You are too loco,
even for us villains.

40:42.867 --> 40:44.967
- Great job,
bringing us all here

40:45.033 --> 40:46.200
for your bogus contest

40:46.267 --> 40:47.400
and instead, you sap,

40:47.467 --> 40:48.800
we're all prisoners of

40:48.867 --> 40:50.633
some stinking psycho
river pirate!

40:50.700 --> 40:52.367
- Listen, Helga, I--

40:52.433 --> 40:53.700
I didn't want to hurt--

40:53.767 --> 40:55.600
- Ah, save the speech.
You'll be fine.

40:55.667 --> 40:58.033
As for all of you,
lock them up.

40:58.100 --> 40:59.733
- [gasps]
What?

40:59.800 --> 41:01.433
- You heard the boss.
Move it.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.267
- I can't believe
you did this, Che.

41:03.333 --> 41:04.533
- Muévelo, muévelo.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.300
Rápido, rápido.

41:06.367 --> 41:07.833
- This is all your fault!

41:07.900 --> 41:09.867
- This is really bad.
- Way to go, Arnold.

41:09.933 --> 41:12.600
- I'm really disappointed
in Arnold.

41:13.633 --> 41:15.633
[all gasp]

41:16.367 --> 41:18.733
[crying]

41:18.800 --> 41:20.400
- Next chance I get,
I'm knocking

41:20.467 --> 41:23.433
that dingus Arnold
into next week.

41:23.500 --> 41:26.433
[melancholy music]

41:26.500 --> 41:29.733
- [snoring]

41:38.633 --> 41:40.700
- Mom, Dad,

41:40.767 --> 41:43.267
all these years, I hoped
that we'd find each other

41:43.333 --> 41:45.967
and be a family again.

41:46.067 --> 41:47.833
But...

41:47.900 --> 41:51.867
I guess I'm never
going to find you.

41:51.933 --> 41:54.067
I'll never know
what happened to you.

41:54.133 --> 41:56.400
* *

41:56.467 --> 42:00.433
[Arnold sobs]

42:00.500 --> 42:02.100
Good-bye, Mom.

42:02.167 --> 42:04.300
Good-bye, Dad.

42:04.367 --> 42:06.067
I'm sorry.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.600
I'm so sorry.

42:07.667 --> 42:08.967
[romantic music]

42:09.067 --> 42:10.633
- Oh, Arnold...

42:10.700 --> 42:12.900
you poor tortured creature.

42:12.967 --> 42:14.967
Having known the depths
of your despair,

42:15.067 --> 42:17.867
I wouldn't have left your side
in your time of loneliness!

42:17.933 --> 42:20.733
If ever you needed my love,
it's now, and you have it,

42:20.800 --> 42:22.433
forever and always.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.333
I must do anything,

42:24.400 --> 42:25.533
make any sacrifice,

42:25.600 --> 42:27.067
to help you find your parents.

42:27.100 --> 42:30.133
Oh, Arnold,
you magnificent specimen!

42:30.200 --> 42:31.933
I'm coming for you!

42:32.700 --> 42:34.967
[music fades]

42:35.067 --> 42:38.067
- [wheezy breathing]

42:39.967 --> 42:42.067
Uh, Helga?

42:42.133 --> 42:45.200
[romantic music]

42:45.267 --> 42:46.900
- Brainy? Oh!

42:46.967 --> 42:48.367
I could hit you!

42:48.433 --> 42:50.233
* *

42:53.767 --> 42:56.900
[upbeat tune on pipes]

42:56.967 --> 42:58.833
* *

42:58.900 --> 43:00.933
- Phoebe, Gerald!
- What's up, Helga?

43:01.067 --> 43:03.267
- Look, Arnold may be
a total sap

43:03.333 --> 43:04.333
who traded all of our lives

43:04.400 --> 43:05.467
for a bag of metaphorical

43:05.533 --> 43:06.533
magic beans,

43:06.600 --> 43:07.800
but he needs our help.

43:07.867 --> 43:09.167
We've got to do something!

43:09.233 --> 43:10.667
- Ugh.

43:10.733 --> 43:12.367
That kid's gonna be doing
my chores for weeks

43:12.433 --> 43:13.567
to make up for this,

43:13.633 --> 43:14.567
but I'm in.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.633
What's the plan?

43:15.700 --> 43:17.100
- Phoebe?
- Hmm...

43:17.167 --> 43:19.433
We can't all escape
at the same time.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.233
They'll certainly notice
our absence

43:21.300 --> 43:22.400
and capture us again.

43:22.467 --> 43:24.133
- Okay, so, Helga,

43:24.200 --> 43:26.133
you and I bust Arnold out
so we can find

43:26.200 --> 43:28.600
these Green-Eyed People,
and Phoebe...

43:28.667 --> 43:31.967
- I'll take care
of everything here.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.533
- [crying]

43:33.600 --> 43:36.100
I miss Arnold!

43:36.167 --> 43:37.367
[crying]

43:37.433 --> 43:40.367
[sly music]

43:40.433 --> 43:41.633
* *

43:41.700 --> 43:43.700
- Yah! Hi-ho, Silver!

43:43.767 --> 43:48.533
- Oh, no, Curly has gone
completely crazy!

43:48.600 --> 43:51.333
Get him off of me!

43:51.400 --> 43:53.733
- [chuckles]

43:53.800 --> 43:55.400
- [yells maniacally]

43:55.467 --> 43:57.700
- See you on the other side...

43:57.767 --> 44:00.133
handsome.

44:01.133 --> 44:03.300
- [laughing]
It tickles.

44:03.367 --> 44:05.367
- [grunts]

44:05.433 --> 44:06.967
- What's go--

44:08.267 --> 44:10.133
- Shh.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.833
- What are you guys
doing here?

44:11.900 --> 44:13.967
- We're your rescue committee.

44:14.067 --> 44:16.200
- I thought you guys hated me.

44:16.267 --> 44:18.133
- Well, of course,
everyone hates you, bucko,

44:18.200 --> 44:19.633
but we've got to bust you
out of here

44:19.700 --> 44:20.933
and find those Green-Eyes

44:21.067 --> 44:22.500
if we want to save ourselves.

44:22.567 --> 44:24.600
- But what can we do?

44:24.667 --> 44:26.767
Lasombra won.
- Don't you give up now!

44:26.833 --> 44:28.167
Your blind optimism

44:28.233 --> 44:30.167
is one of your
most annoying qualities.

44:30.233 --> 44:32.633
* *

44:33.367 --> 44:35.933
Besides,
after the Green-Eyes help us,

44:36.067 --> 44:37.500
they might have
some information

44:37.567 --> 44:39.200
on your parents.

44:39.267 --> 44:40.533
[rousing music]

44:40.600 --> 44:41.800
- Come on.

44:41.867 --> 44:45.100
- [snoring]

44:46.067 --> 44:47.067
Hmm?

44:47.133 --> 44:48.433
[snores]

44:48.500 --> 44:51.233
Oh...

44:51.300 --> 44:52.500
[mumbles]

44:52.567 --> 44:56.800
* *

44:56.867 --> 44:59.200
- Grandpa said
this would come in handy.

44:59.267 --> 45:06.367
* *

45:12.067 --> 45:13.100
- Hmm?

45:13.167 --> 45:15.267
Oh, what--
what are you--

45:15.333 --> 45:17.667
[grunts]

45:17.733 --> 45:19.567
- Grandpa was right,
football head.

45:19.633 --> 45:22.567
[Curly yelling]

45:22.633 --> 45:24.167
- This isn't funny anymore!

45:24.233 --> 45:28.667
* *

45:28.733 --> 45:30.567
- Nadine, now!

45:30.633 --> 45:33.600
[dramatic music]

45:33.667 --> 45:35.500
- Oh, araña--

45:35.567 --> 45:36.500
[screams]

45:36.567 --> 45:43.800
* *

45:50.533 --> 45:52.433
- Whoo.

45:59.367 --> 46:01.333
We did it. We're free.

46:03.333 --> 46:05.167
[warm music]

46:05.233 --> 46:08.367
- Thanks for not
giving up on me, Gerald.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.067
* *

46:10.133 --> 46:11.200
- Ah!

46:11.267 --> 46:13.100
And now that you've
dragged us

46:13.167 --> 46:14.633
to stinking San Nowhere-zo,

46:14.700 --> 46:16.067
how do we find
these Green-Eyes?

46:16.133 --> 46:18.100
- Don't worry,
I've got a map,

46:18.167 --> 46:20.200
and according
to my dad's journal,

46:20.267 --> 46:22.800
the Green-Eyes live
somewhere around here.

46:22.867 --> 46:25.133
Come on!

46:25.200 --> 46:27.733
- Cute. He's got a map.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.467
- [grunting]
Oof!

46:29.533 --> 46:30.900
- What's going on?

46:30.967 --> 46:33.433
- Jefe, the weird-headed
mocoso escaped.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.100
It's not my fault!

46:35.167 --> 46:38.300
- So, did a small child
knock you out,

46:38.367 --> 46:41.400
or did you just fall asleep,
pobrecito?

46:41.467 --> 46:44.100
- [crying]
Please, Jefe, don't kill me!

46:44.967 --> 46:46.467
- [chuckles]

46:46.533 --> 46:48.667
[laughs heartily]

46:48.733 --> 46:51.267
[both laughing]

46:51.333 --> 46:52.500
- Ah, well done.

46:52.567 --> 46:53.833
You did exactly
as I wanted.

46:53.900 --> 46:55.333
- Hmm?

46:55.400 --> 46:56.333
I did?

46:56.400 --> 46:58.100
- See?

46:58.167 --> 47:00.167
I intended for him
to escape.

47:00.233 --> 47:02.733
The Green-Eyes would not
have shown themselves

47:02.800 --> 47:04.133
if I was with him,

47:04.200 --> 47:06.200
so I put a tracking device
on him.

47:06.267 --> 47:08.800
Now, he will lead me
straight to them.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.233
Gather the crew.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.633
We're going hunting
for Green-Eyes

47:12.700 --> 47:15.700
and their precious Corazón.

47:15.767 --> 47:18.067
- [crazed yelling]

47:18.100 --> 47:19.933
- [gasps]
Oh, no!

47:20.067 --> 47:22.600
They've already discovered
that Arnold has escaped!

47:22.667 --> 47:26.067
Baby sister!
[sobs]

47:26.067 --> 47:27.567
- Don't panic, Olga.

47:27.633 --> 47:28.733
Do you still have that bag

47:28.800 --> 47:30.467
of Big Bob's beepers?

47:30.533 --> 47:31.833
- Right here.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.767
But these can only
receive messages.

47:34.833 --> 47:37.833
It's one-way communication.

47:37.900 --> 47:39.600
Just like me and Che.

47:39.667 --> 47:42.233
- But Rhonda's phone
can send a message.

47:42.300 --> 47:45.567
- News flash: nada bar-os.
[gasps]

47:45.633 --> 47:47.733
- I can tap into
Lasombra's Wi-Fi signal...

47:47.800 --> 47:49.100
- My phone!

47:49.167 --> 47:50.467
- And transmit
a low-data package

47:50.533 --> 47:52.167
that will bypass
the need for a password.

47:52.233 --> 47:53.933
Now we need to scavenge

47:54.067 --> 47:55.533
some additional parts.

47:55.600 --> 47:58.533
[upbeat music]

47:58.600 --> 48:04.500
* *

48:04.567 --> 48:05.833
8-0-8 for "Bob,"

48:05.900 --> 48:07.900
and 5-0-5 for "SOS."

48:07.967 --> 48:09.967
Voila.

48:10.067 --> 48:11.933
We now have
a long-wave homing beacon

48:12.067 --> 48:14.333
sending our
precise coordinates.

48:14.400 --> 48:18.067
* *

48:18.133 --> 48:20.333
- [snoring]

48:20.400 --> 48:22.733
- Thanks for the help
on the new display, Miriam.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.900
[beepers ringing]

48:23.967 --> 48:26.300
Whoa.

48:26.367 --> 48:27.167
- Huh?

48:27.233 --> 48:28.333
Uh, I'm up, I'm up.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.333
- Beepers are freaking out.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.667
I don't get it.
What does--

48:31.733 --> 48:33.533
What does 505-808 mean?

48:33.600 --> 48:34.900
- Oh, that's beeper code

48:34.967 --> 48:36.600
for "SOS, Bob."

48:36.667 --> 48:38.300
"SOS" means "help."

48:38.367 --> 48:40.133
- I know what "SOS" means,

48:40.200 --> 48:42.733
but who would want
my help now, Miriam?

48:42.800 --> 48:45.100
- Aren't the girls
on a field trip?

48:45.167 --> 48:47.133
[gasps]
both: Olga!

48:47.200 --> 48:50.333
[frantic music]

48:50.400 --> 48:52.133
* *

48:52.200 --> 48:54.333
- Oh, and the other one.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.433
- Oh, right, right, Helga.

48:59.067 --> 49:00.200
[doorbell buzzes]

49:00.267 --> 49:01.833
- All right, all right.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.500
Keep your pants on.

49:03.567 --> 49:05.433
Abner?
- [desperate squeal]

49:05.500 --> 49:07.067
How in the Toledo
did you get here?

49:07.100 --> 49:08.333
- Oh, my!

49:08.400 --> 49:09.900
What happened?

49:09.967 --> 49:12.600
- [squealing]

49:12.667 --> 49:13.733
[ragtime music]

49:13.800 --> 49:14.800
- What?

49:14.867 --> 49:15.800
- [squealing]

49:15.867 --> 49:16.800
- No.

49:16.867 --> 49:18.067
- [grunting]

49:18.133 --> 49:19.933
- [gasps]
No.

You got us lost,

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.333
* *

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.167
- All right.
Close enough, sister.

01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:10.900
- Hey, Arnold, check it out!

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.733
- Looks like the king is...
sleeping?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.267
Lazy much?

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:18.133
- This must be about
the sleeping sickness

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.400
that my parents came here
to cure.

01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:21.533
- Arnold...

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.133
[speaking native language]

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.600
- Looks like she's giving us
the grand tour.

01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:28.200
- It better be grand.

01:00:28.267 --> 01:00:30.033
We've come a long way
for this.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.867
- Look, there's a bunch
of people sleeping

01:00:31.933 --> 01:00:33.800
over here, too.

01:00:33.867 --> 01:00:36.533
- So is this what happened to
all the grownups in this joint?

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.867
They're asleep?

01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:43.933
* *

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.800
- Mom, Dad.

01:00:45.867 --> 01:00:48.100
Do you know where they are?

01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:51.567
Please, do you know
these people?

01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:55.433
- [speaking native language]

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.833
- Oh, my gosh.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.233
These paintings are, like,

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.067
straight out of
my dad's journal.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.167
That's the first time
they brought the serum

01:01:03.233 --> 01:01:04.867
to the Green-Eyes.

01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:06.067
- The serum?

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.200
- Yeah, the cure

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:08.967
for the sleeping sickness.

01:01:09.067 --> 01:01:10.833
[melancholy music]

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.067
But at some point
they didn't have enough?

01:01:14.967 --> 01:01:17.400
- What's going on here,
Arnold?

01:01:17.467 --> 01:01:20.867
- My parents are making more
of the cure?

01:01:20.933 --> 01:01:24.167
- [speaking native language]

01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:27.967
- It's the Corazón.

01:01:28.067 --> 01:01:30.433
- The treasure Lasombra's
so crazy about?

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:34.067
- Child of the volcano.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.900
Is that supposed to be me?

01:01:36.967 --> 01:01:38.433
- [speaking native language]

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.700
Arnold!

01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:41.600
[speaking native language]

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:43.833
[cheering]

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.833
[dramatic music]

01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:08.233
[soft music]

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.700
- What am I supposed to do?

01:02:10.767 --> 01:02:14.100
- [speaking native language]

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:16.100
* *

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:18.467
- I know you want me
to do something,

01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:20.100
but I need more
to go on.

01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:22.133
- This...
whatever it is

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.833
looks like the thing
from the painting.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.567
See?
Up there, in the middle.

01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:29.067
- Hey, yeah. And they've got
the Corazón there, too.

01:02:30.133 --> 01:02:32.800
- But...I don't know
what to do.

01:02:32.867 --> 01:02:34.433
- I know what to do.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.133
Buenos días,
partner.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.667
[all gasp]

01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:39.667
- [speaking native language]

01:02:39.733 --> 01:02:41.067
Lasombra.

01:02:41.067 --> 01:02:42.067
- So you've heard
of me?

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.300
How flattering.

01:02:43.367 --> 01:02:45.233
Well, I am infamous.
[laughs]

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.433
[haunting music]

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.067
* *

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.633
At last.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.133
The Corazón.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.867
The sacred treasure
of the Green-Eyed People

01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:57.333
is finally mine!

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.167
- No, it's not yours!
We need it!

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:02.200
It's got something to do
with the sleeping sickness!

01:03:02.267 --> 01:03:04.767
- Oh. You think so?

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.533
Well, it's too late.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.400
It's mine now.

01:03:08.467 --> 01:03:11.900
And you, my fabled
football-headed friend,

01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:13.667
led me right to it.

01:03:13.733 --> 01:03:15.367
- What?
- Oh?

01:03:15.433 --> 01:03:16.900
You did not realize

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.267
you were wearing
a tracking device?

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:19.433
- The amulet?

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.400
- Gah! Of course!
- Yes.

01:03:22.467 --> 01:03:26.200
I used the Green-Eyed People's
own treasure against them.

01:03:26.267 --> 01:03:29.267
I thought that was
a very clever evil touch.

01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:31.333
And after centuries
of being hidden,

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.333
you, Arnold,
brought me right to them.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.967
- Where are our friends?

01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:38.433
- Ah, don't worry.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.933
My guards are keeping
an eye on them.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.367
Speaking of which,

01:03:41.433 --> 01:03:42.967
who is guarding this place?

01:03:43.067 --> 01:03:44.733
[foreboding music]

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.867
Wait.

01:03:45.933 --> 01:03:47.600
You are all children?

01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:48.833
- Uh, doi.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.233
Welcome to five minutes ago.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.933
- A hidden city
full of treasures

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:54.267
and no guards, only children,

01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:56.100
to stop me
from taking it all?

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:57.600
Why stop at the Corazón?

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.767
- No!

01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:00.167
You can't take their things!

01:04:00.233 --> 01:04:01.233
- You're right.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.933
Why take anything

01:04:03.067 --> 01:04:04.667
when I could bring people here

01:04:04.733 --> 01:04:06.067
and sell it to them?

01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:08.100
I could charge admission!

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:09.467
I can see it now:

01:04:09.533 --> 01:04:12.633
"Hidden City-Land."
Ow!

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.133
How dare you?

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.333
Ah!

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.067
You meddling--

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.133
don't understand capitalism!

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.467
[amulet chimes]

01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:22.733
Yah!

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.333
[growls]

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.367
[all gasp]
- [speaking native language]

01:04:26.433 --> 01:04:28.300
- I can see we're not wanted
here, Arnold.

01:04:28.367 --> 01:04:30.067
Vámonos.
- No!

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.200
- No?
[laughs]

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.800
I need you, partner.

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:34.333
- Oh!

01:04:36.567 --> 01:04:37.933
[ominous music]

01:04:38.067 --> 01:04:39.200
- Ah!

01:04:39.267 --> 01:04:41.667
[both exclaiming]

01:04:41.733 --> 01:04:42.800
- Come on.

01:04:42.867 --> 01:04:48.533
* *

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.567
- Arnold!
- Stop!

01:04:50.633 --> 01:04:52.367
- Guys, wait, don't!

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:54.067
- Oh criminy.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.267
So of course I've got to go out
on the stupid rope bridge

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.933
to save the stupid
football head.

01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:01.133
- Oh man, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.500
- [grunts]

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.300
[gasps]
No!

01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:06.767
Go back!

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:08.900
both: Ah!

01:05:08.967 --> 01:05:10.400
[screaming]

01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:12.067

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.867
[both screaming]

01:05:15.933 --> 01:05:18.433
- Helga, Gerald, hang on!
- [laughing]

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.067
Come here, volcano boy.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.967
- Let me go! Ugh.

01:05:22.067 --> 01:05:23.467
- Let you go?

01:05:23.533 --> 01:05:25.600
You are the only one
who can open it.

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:28.967
- No!
We need to save my friends.

01:05:29.067 --> 01:05:30.900
- First, open the Corazón.

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:33.300
Then you can play
with your little amigos.

01:05:33.367 --> 01:05:35.133
[soft music]

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.667
- Take your time, Arnoldo.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:39.267
We just love
hanging out here.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:46.567

01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:50.400

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.400
- It's the heart of gold.

[warm music]

01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:14.533
- Out of my way!

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.567
So beautiful.

01:06:16.633 --> 01:06:18.133
And it's all mine...

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.933
[music fades]

01:06:20.067 --> 01:06:22.067

[scream fades]

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.967
- I want to un-see that.

01:06:33.067 --> 01:06:34.833
- Take my hand!

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.500
- Pull!

01:06:36.567 --> 01:06:37.600
- I'm trying!

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:39.500
- Try harder!

01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:41.267
- Whoa!

01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:43.067

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:07.467
- Who's that?

01:07:07.533 --> 01:07:09.067
- Who cares?

- [pants]
Hey.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:20.433
Aren't you...
- Eduardo!

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.700
It's really you?

01:07:21.767 --> 01:07:23.200
- Hello, my--
- Wait.

01:07:23.267 --> 01:07:25.333
Not another Eduardo,

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.367
your parents' trusted friend

01:07:27.433 --> 01:07:28.800
with a moustache?

01:07:28.867 --> 01:07:30.733
Ha! I've heard that before.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.067
Why should we trust him?

01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:34.933
- You are welcome
to climb back down.

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:36.233
- How'd you find us?

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.600
- I have been following you
since your class

01:07:37.667 --> 01:07:39.200
came to San Lorenzo.

01:07:39.267 --> 01:07:40.833
I suspected that Lasombra would

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.967
use you to get to
the Green-Eyed People somehow.

01:07:43.067 --> 01:07:45.567
They broke into my place
and kidnapped me.

01:07:45.633 --> 01:07:48.400
I escaped, but got to the dock
too late.

01:07:48.467 --> 01:07:50.133
I hate to chase you
in another boat.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.567
- Oh.
On the river!

01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:54.567
We thought we were
being attacked by pirates.

01:07:54.633 --> 01:07:56.400
- No, it was me.

01:07:56.467 --> 01:07:58.167
I lost you at the rapids

01:07:58.233 --> 01:08:00.667
but I was able to pick up
your trail where you crashed.

01:08:00.733 --> 01:08:02.400
- I'm so glad you're here.

01:08:02.467 --> 01:08:03.900
We found the
Green-Eyed People's

01:08:03.967 --> 01:08:05.067
hidden city.

01:08:05.133 --> 01:08:06.567
It's where my parents
disappeared.

01:08:06.633 --> 01:08:08.600
- So then you have seen them?

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:10.600
Miles and Stella are--
are alive?

01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:11.800
- I don't know.

01:08:11.867 --> 01:08:13.100

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.633
- So, you finally

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.533
caught up to us, Eduardo.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.867
You call that a moustache?

01:08:21.933 --> 01:08:24.332
- Did you think you could
get away with this, Lasombra?

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:27.667
Miles and Stella protected
the Green-Eyed People from you,

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:30.466
and now, their son will, too.

01:08:30.533 --> 01:08:32.466
- Always so presumptuous.

01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:34.300
They're not safe yet.

01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:35.567
[yells]

01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:37.466

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:39.567

01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:55.600

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:58.067
- Give it to me! It's mine!

[gasps]

01:09:07.067 --> 01:09:09.067
- You pest!
Just like your parents!

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.533
I'm going to throw you
over the cliff.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.200
Go get it!

01:09:12.267 --> 01:09:14.332
[wheezes]

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:20.966

01:09:21.067 --> 01:09:21.899
- [sighs]

01:09:21.966 --> 01:09:23.466
He died the way he lived:

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.067
full of poison.

01:09:25.133 --> 01:09:26.433
- The Corazón!

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.167
It was sacred to them.

01:09:28.233 --> 01:09:30.667
Now it's gone.

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.367
- Hey, football head.

01:09:32.433 --> 01:09:34.067
We're alive, okay?

01:09:34.067 --> 01:09:36.067
Now let's go back
to that hidden city

01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:37.667
and find out what happened
to your parents.

01:09:37.733 --> 01:09:39.167
- One question:

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:41.067
How are we gonna
get back over there?

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.533
- Um, I prefer
the stone bridge, myself.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.133
- Well, all right, then.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.600
* *

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:51.633
- [gasps]

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.767
Arnold.

01:09:52.832 --> 01:09:56.233
[speaking native language]

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.333

[continues speaking
native language]

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.500
- Arnold,

01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:18.200
your parents are here.

01:10:18.267 --> 01:10:20.233
She will take us

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.533
to where they lie.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.533
[melancholy music]

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.433

- [gasps]

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.967
Dad?

01:10:35.033 --> 01:10:38.067
Mom?

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.667
It's me.

01:10:39.733 --> 01:10:41.300
- Arnold...

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:42.833
- Are they...
- No, no.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.567
It's the sleeping sickness,

01:10:44.633 --> 01:10:46.567
from over nine years ago.

01:10:46.633 --> 01:10:47.700
- But...

01:10:47.767 --> 01:10:49.033
they had a cure.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.933
- Yeah,
and it had something to do

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
with that big stone wheel
thingy in the temple.

01:10:53.067 --> 01:10:55.800
- Ol' What's-her-name's
got to know about it.

01:10:55.867 --> 01:10:58.800
- [speaking native language]

01:10:58.867 --> 01:11:00.667
- They believe that you
are the one

01:11:00.733 --> 01:11:02.667
to open the Corazón,

01:11:02.733 --> 01:11:04.733
and with a heart of gold
inside,

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.767
you would awaken
the sleeping parents

01:11:06.833 --> 01:11:09.900
and reunite them
with their children.

01:11:09.967 --> 01:11:12.833
- The Corazón was the cure?

01:11:14.067 --> 01:11:14.833
- But...

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.267
It went over the cliff.

01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:19.800
- We have to tell her
what happened.

01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:22.367
* *

01:11:22.433 --> 01:11:26.733
- [speaking native language]
Lasombra...

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.500

[speaking native language]

01:11:35.933 --> 01:11:37.900
- But they're alive.

01:11:37.967 --> 01:11:41.233
There's got to be a way
to wake up your parents.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.333
[exciting music]

01:11:51.067 --> 01:11:52.767
- Helga, what are you doing?

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:54.433
- This must be it!

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.867
You were supposed to put
the heart of gold here

01:11:57.933 --> 01:12:00.600
and then, well,
something would happen.

01:12:00.667 --> 01:12:01.833
I'm not a scientist.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.167
- I know what this is.

01:12:03.233 --> 01:12:04.833
These are the controls
to a machine

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.400
Miles told me about.

01:12:06.467 --> 01:12:08.467
The Green-Eyed People
would put herbal formulas

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.300
in the center altar,
and the machine

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:12.100
would spread them aromatically.

01:12:12.167 --> 01:12:13.967
- My dad and mom
knew about this.

01:12:14.067 --> 01:12:15.500
It's in the mural!

01:12:15.567 --> 01:12:18.133
[mysterious flute music]

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.733
So, instead of herbs...

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.933
[gasps]
Look!

01:12:22.067 --> 01:12:23.367
They put the cure right here

01:12:23.433 --> 01:12:25.367
so it could cure
the whole city at once.

01:12:25.433 --> 01:12:27.200
- Ah, genius.

01:12:27.267 --> 01:12:30.133
- But without
the heart of gold...

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.833
the Green-Eyes,

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.600
my parents...

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:35.233
they can't be cured.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.700
- I might have something
that would work.

01:12:38.767 --> 01:12:41.533
[soft music]

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.133
It's, uh, a heart.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.067
I think it could fit.

01:12:47.133 --> 01:12:49.267
This is just gold-plated.

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:51.500
It's not a very pure heart.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:52.767
- I don't know.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:54.267
I think your heart

01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:56.867
is more pure than you know.

01:12:56.933 --> 01:12:58.100
- [sighs]

01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:00.967

01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:18.667
You are such a football head.

01:14:24.067 --> 01:14:25.800
- There's butterflies.

01:14:25.867 --> 01:14:27.167
Wait.

01:14:27.233 --> 01:14:28.700
Could that mean...

Arnold, Arnold...

- Looks like you finished
the work we started, Arnold.

01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:52.900
- I'm so proud of you, son.

01:15:52.967 --> 01:15:54.433
- Mm-mm-mm.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.067
Now I've seen everything.

Hey, Helga.

- Ah!

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.200
Hey, Arnold.

01:16:18.067 --> 01:16:19.533
- Helga, I've known you

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.567
my whole life, practically,

01:16:21.633 --> 01:16:25.067
and you've always been
angry and kind of...

01:16:25.067 --> 01:16:27.800
You know, mean.
- Yeah.

01:16:27.867 --> 01:16:29.633
So?

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.500
- But...

01:16:31.567 --> 01:16:33.733
I've also seen you
be really loyal

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.867
and super brave.

01:16:35.933 --> 01:16:37.500
So I always wondered if

01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:40.733
maybe you were mean to me
because,

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.700
well, you loved me.

01:16:42.767 --> 01:16:45.433
- Love?
You?

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.233
Well, yeah, sure, I mean,
like I'd love a root canal.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.367
- Listen, I know
you tried to tell me before,

01:16:50.433 --> 01:16:52.900
and I wasn't ready
to hear it,

01:16:52.967 --> 01:16:55.333
but now,
this whole thing--

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.967
the trip to San Lorenzo,

01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:58.967
getting away from Lasombra,

01:16:59.067 --> 01:17:00.500
finding my parents--

01:17:00.567 --> 01:17:02.767
it's all 'cause of you.

01:17:02.833 --> 01:17:03.833
Your locket...

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.567
- Locket? What locket?

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.567
- Your locket--
it woke up my parents.

01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:15.067
You did it all
just to help me,

01:17:15.133 --> 01:17:16.867
and...

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:18.833
and...

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.833
[tender music]

Mom? Dad?

- Hey, gramps,
what's for breakfast?

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.167
I'm starving over here!
Starving!

01:18:01.233 --> 01:18:03.433
- Make me a sandwich,
old man.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.333
- Crispy fries
and a tofu burger

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.233
for me, please,
and step on it!

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.300
[smooth jazz]

01:18:10.367 --> 01:18:12.733
- Breakfast is served.
Eggs in a basket.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.500
- Don't you mean
toad-in-a-hole?

01:18:15.567 --> 01:18:16.967
- We call it
eggs-in-a-basket.

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:18.433
- Finally, someone with...
- No disrespect,

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.533
but you've both been

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.800
asleep for ten years.

01:18:20.867 --> 01:18:22.467
What do you know
about breakfast?

01:18:22.533 --> 01:18:24.867
- [laughs]
Mom! Dad!

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.200
You're really back!

01:18:26.267 --> 01:18:27.633
both: Hey, Arnold!

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.633
- Were you having
that same dream again,

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.633
where you never found us?

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.133
- Yeah, the same dream
I've been having all summer.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.767
- It's no dream, Arnold.

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.667
You really came
and rescued us,

01:18:37.733 --> 01:18:40.933
and now we're really
back home with you.

01:18:41.067 --> 01:18:43.733
What do you say
we go on an adventure today?

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.700
I read that
the city botanical gardens

01:18:45.767 --> 01:18:47.367
has a new rainforest exhibit.

01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:49.433
- Sounds great, but...

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.700
it's actually
the first day of school.

01:18:51.767 --> 01:18:53.167
- Oh, of course!

01:18:53.233 --> 01:18:55.833
We knew that.
- Sure. We're hip.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.633
- [squeals]
- Come on, Abner.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:00.333
- Creepy.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.133
- Who is that cute
little blond boy?

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.400
- Bye, everyone!

01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:06.067
- Bye!
- Good-bye, Arnold!

01:19:06.133 --> 01:19:10.067
[animals chattering]

01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:11.367
- Well, Arnold,

01:19:11.433 --> 01:19:13.500
you ready for
the worst day of school?

01:19:13.567 --> 01:19:15.633
- You mean the first day
of school?

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.367
- That's what I said.

01:19:17.433 --> 01:19:19.367
- Come on, Gerald.
Look at the bright side.

01:19:19.433 --> 01:19:21.067
We're in sixth grade now.

01:19:21.133 --> 01:19:22.267
How bad could it be?

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:29.567
* *

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.733
- [sighs]

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.567
[discordant musical tone]

01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:36.567
Hey! Who said
you could touch me?

01:19:36.633 --> 01:19:39.700
[smooth jazz]

01:19:39.767 --> 01:19:41.867
- Hey, Arnold!
- Hey, Arnold!

01:19:41.933 --> 01:19:43.433
Can we walk with you to school?

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.200
- Yeah, we already miss you.

01:19:45.267 --> 01:19:47.467
- [laughs]
Sure, Mom and Dad.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.300
- Hey, Arnold!

01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:51.367
* *

01:19:51.433 --> 01:19:52.767
- Welcome back!

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.433
- Hey, Arnold!
I still have a job!

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.400
- You'll have to stay outside,
okay?

01:19:56.467 --> 01:19:58.533
- Okay.
- When will you be done?

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.267
[school bell rings]
- Uh, 3:30.

01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:03.133
- We'll be waiting
right here.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:09.933
* *

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.133
[smooth jazz music]

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:25.233
* *

01:20:31.133 --> 01:20:32.400
[Helga sighs]

01:20:32.467 --> 01:20:39.700
* *

01:21:08.067 --> 01:21:10.900
Yeah, yeah, Arnold.
