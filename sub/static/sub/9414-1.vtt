00:05.008 --> 00:09.845
I never experienced anything paranormal before I moved into that house.

00:09.846 --> 00:11.080
What is that?

00:11.081 --> 00:13.781
I have no idea.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.651
Hear it?

00:15.652 --> 00:17.185
It's walking back and forth up there.

00:17.186 --> 00:19.343
Quiet, everyone. Shh, shh! Quiet!

00:19.344 --> 00:21.443
We didn't expect anything to happen.

00:21.444 --> 00:23.946
But this night was different.

00:23.947 --> 00:25.364
I'm getting goose bumps.

00:25.365 --> 00:28.725
I can recall that moment.

00:29.853 --> 00:32.253
He was lifted through the air.

00:32.253 --> 00:33.606
What happened?

00:33.607 --> 00:36.307
I was in shock.

00:36.410 --> 00:40.289
I was worried they would find me dead.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.130
Or that I would find them dead.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:07.874 --> 01:10.709
I was 23 years old.

01:10.710 --> 01:13.879
I had a
two-year-old son.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.471
And I was six or seven months pregnant with my daughter.

01:17.472 --> 01:19.117
My husband and I were having problems,

01:19.118 --> 01:22.200
and we just decided it was better for us and the kids,

01:22.201 --> 01:25.801
if we just weren't together.

01:26.788 --> 01:28.477
I was looking for a place to rent,

01:28.478 --> 01:30.964
and I wasn't looking for anything in particular.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.563
I just stumbled across that place.

01:32.564 --> 01:34.467
- Apple?
- I liked it right away.

01:34.468 --> 01:36.014
Yeah.

01:36.015 --> 01:38.134
It was a little bungalow. It was off the street.

01:38.135 --> 01:44.035
It was private. It was the perfect place to start a new life.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.668
My ambitions were to finish school.

01:46.669 --> 01:50.721
And to get a job that I could support my family with.

01:50.722 --> 01:52.620
I was trying to get my degree,

01:52.621 --> 01:58.081
so it was a lot of work at home, a lot of studying.

01:58.594 --> 02:00.761
This clown is my husband.

02:00.762 --> 02:04.666
- Husband?
- Yeah, you know. Husband.

02:04.667 --> 02:09.061
I had this picture in my mind. Everything was just gonna be perfect.

02:09.062 --> 02:14.962
But after about a month or so, I started to hear odd sounds around the house.

02:27.457 --> 02:30.576
It sounded like pebbles..

02:30.577 --> 02:34.206
Like somebody dropped a handful pebbles.

02:34.207 --> 02:40.107
From the top of the wall, and they just fell all the way to the bottom.

02:41.165 --> 02:44.139
That is not a normal sound that a house makes.

02:44.140 --> 02:47.620
It was just so distinctive.

02:49.328 --> 02:53.048
Gave me a shiver up my spine.

03:04.036 --> 03:07.983
Bit by bit, I began to realize that a lot of the activity was..

03:07.984 --> 03:11.044
Coming from above me.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.101
It happened every night.

03:14.102 --> 03:16.575
A very particular strange sound.

03:16.576 --> 03:21.976
Very high-pitched, almost to where it hurt your ears.

03:27.893 --> 03:32.753
It seemed to be coming from up in the attic.

03:36.068 --> 03:40.156
I noticed that the trap door was open.

03:40.157 --> 03:44.242
I never would have opened that door.

03:44.243 --> 03:48.323
I wanted to put the door on right.

04:01.018 --> 04:04.035
I started to think that I was not alone.

04:04.036 --> 04:09.436
That there was other things in that house besides me.

04:14.039 --> 04:16.559
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:16.608 --> 04:17.779
You okay?

04:17.781 --> 04:22.941
My close friends were staying more and more often.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.062
Thanks.

04:26.063 --> 04:30.996
I remember telling my friend, Susan, some of the things that happened.

04:30.997 --> 04:33.141
So what's up?

04:33.142 --> 04:35.524
She was a big support.

04:35.525 --> 04:40.865
And they sound like they're coming from the ceiling.

04:41.233 --> 04:42.256
What the hell was that?

04:42.257 --> 04:47.057
We heard a big bang coming from the kitchen.

04:51.510 --> 04:54.366
One of the pictures that was hanging on the wall,

04:54.367 --> 04:58.207
was propped up against the sink.

04:59.151 --> 05:01.486
The nails were also placed..

05:01.487 --> 05:06.152
They were standing perfectly on their heads.

05:06.153 --> 05:09.088
Nails can't come directly out of a hole,

05:09.089 --> 05:13.409
come down, then end up on their heads.

05:16.235 --> 05:19.955
Somebody or something did that.

05:25.544 --> 05:27.524
Eight.

05:27.546 --> 05:28.712
What's this one?

05:28.713 --> 05:31.015
One of the neighbors was a young girl.

05:31.016 --> 05:33.901
She was 16 years old. Her name was Tina.

05:33.902 --> 05:35.926
She would come over and baby-sit for me.

05:35.927 --> 05:38.196
Don't forget to change him before you put him down, okay?

05:38.197 --> 05:39.817
Of course.

05:39.818 --> 05:43.369
I thought that she was really, really nice, and she was a really dedicated Mom.

05:43.370 --> 05:44.938
I'll see you soon, okay?

05:44.939 --> 05:45.989
Hmm? Yeah?

05:45.990 --> 05:47.624
- Go away.
- Be good.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.383
I enjoyed her company a lot. Like, we used to

05:49.384 --> 05:52.063
talk and hang out even when I wasn't babysitting.

05:52.064 --> 05:56.444
- Okay. Have a good night.
- Okay. Bye.

05:59.321 --> 06:01.988
Jackie was out, and she'd asked me to babysit.

06:01.989 --> 06:05.049
And Jamie was asleep.

06:09.013 --> 06:11.715
It was getting pretty late. I hadn't heard any noise for a while.

06:11.716 --> 06:17.616
So I wanted to just make sure that he was okay and peek in on him.

06:32.958 --> 06:38.858
The door just opened for me, and I thought, "well, that's weird".

06:40.144 --> 06:43.546
Turned around and pushed the door closed behind me.

06:43.547 --> 06:46.967
The latch caught the door.

06:47.379 --> 06:50.019
Jamie was fine.

06:53.898 --> 06:57.602
But then coming back, the same thing happened.

06:57.603 --> 07:00.554
I thought, "maybe, you know, it's the house. It's"..

07:00.555 --> 07:06.455
"The floor's not level, If you step here, it's gonna swing the door".

07:07.636 --> 07:09.898
I would explain it away, explain it away.

07:09.899 --> 07:13.578
But when it got to the point that I couldn't explain it away..

07:13.579 --> 07:16.819
It was very frightening.

07:18.076 --> 07:19.434
So how's school going?

07:19.435 --> 07:21.584
It's all right.

07:21.585 --> 07:26.445
We were just talking, making something to eat.

07:31.595 --> 07:34.331
Hey, do you see this?

07:34.332 --> 07:38.772
I looked up, and there was these lights.

07:39.938 --> 07:41.503
What is that?

07:41.504 --> 07:44.204
I have no idea.

07:46.945 --> 07:50.653
It wasn't something that I've ever seen before.

07:50.654 --> 07:53.112
It's not like a reflection off of anything.

07:53.113 --> 07:55.117
They had, like, substance to them, you know?

07:55.118 --> 07:57.587
I really don't have a good feeling about this.

07:57.588 --> 07:59.354
- You know what?
- Yeah, Jackie, let's just get out.

07:59.355 --> 08:02.192
I did not want to be in her house.

08:02.193 --> 08:07.713
I remember grabbing the camera and taking some pictures.

08:13.454 --> 08:14.861
Oh, come on.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.079
Then all of a sudden, the camera stopped working.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.580
What is wrong with this thing?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.969
She handed me the camera, and she's like..

08:19.970 --> 08:21.527
"See if you can get it to work". And I thought..

08:21.528 --> 08:24.841
"Well, maybe if we're not trying to take pictures of the lights, it'll work".

08:24.842 --> 08:29.222
So I pointed it out the kitchen window.

08:32.850 --> 08:35.919
I saw a face in the viewfinder.

08:35.921 --> 08:38.355
Of an emaciated old man..

08:38.356 --> 08:40.950
Almost skeleton-like.

08:40.951 --> 08:43.530
I had to run.

08:44.072 --> 08:46.343
When that happened, there was no doubt in my

08:46.344 --> 08:51.084
mind that there was something in that house.

09:16.232 --> 09:17.867
What number is that?

09:17.868 --> 09:19.268
- Nine.
- Nine!

09:19.269 --> 09:21.318
Yeah! You're hilarious.

09:21.319 --> 09:23.920
- Seven.
- Seven!

09:23.921 --> 09:24.921
What is that one?

09:24.922 --> 09:27.607
My ex-husband, Al, used to come and visit every now and then.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.060
He was very, very good with Jamie.

09:30.061 --> 09:33.372
I was telling Al some of the things that had been going on in the house.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.408
I think there's something wrong with this house.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.769
She felt that there was something very odd about the house.

09:38.770 --> 09:41.180
She says, "I feel something here".

09:41.181 --> 09:44.656
I get this cold feeling about it.

09:44.657 --> 09:47.556
Truthfully, I thought that she was trying to draw attention.

09:47.557 --> 09:51.896
And trying to draw my attention to the fact that she was alone.

09:51.897 --> 09:53.733
You don't believe me, do you?

09:53.734 --> 09:58.091
He didn't really believe me. He thought I was exaggerating.

09:58.092 --> 10:02.862
Without a doubt, I had to assume that maybe something was wrong with her.

10:02.863 --> 10:06.754
I thought, "how can I explain this to her where she'll feel that,"

10:06.755 --> 10:09.670
"yeah, that's right, that's what it is, nothing to worry about?"

10:09.671 --> 10:11.220
There has to be an explanation.

10:11.221 --> 10:13.521
He was trying to talk to me, and saying, "you know,"

10:13.522 --> 10:16.776
"why don't you just call it out, challenge it?"

10:16.777 --> 10:17.977
What?

10:17.978 --> 10:19.513
Call it out.

10:19.514 --> 10:23.414
I said, "well, if you are here,"

10:23.452 --> 10:25.009
"then let's see".

10:25.010 --> 10:26.793
Show yourself.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.245
I was just terrified. I'm like, "what the heck is he doing?"

10:29.246 --> 10:32.726
"What's gonna happen next?"

10:38.843 --> 10:41.655
Nothing did happen. It was just still.

10:41.656 --> 10:43.516
See?

10:46.984 --> 10:50.404
I'll see you when I can.

10:56.761 --> 10:59.881
I go into the closet.

11:05.588 --> 11:09.088
An entire wall was written Al.

11:09.089 --> 11:12.689
"A" in blue and "L" in red.

11:13.709 --> 11:18.869
And it was written hundreds and hundreds of times.

11:21.519 --> 11:25.719
That was the answer to the challenge.

11:30.288 --> 11:33.659
If I had the money, I would have moved out right away.

11:33.660 --> 11:38.430
But there was no way I could have moved with the expense that it costs to move.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.132
You need to to tell someone what's going on here.

11:41.133 --> 11:44.690
Susan said, "well, maybe you should tell the landlords what's going on".

11:44.691 --> 11:47.039
It's their house.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.564
I remember me saying, "I don't want to tell anybody"

11:49.565 --> 11:54.605
"because I don't want them to think I'm nuts".

12:01.417 --> 12:04.892
It was a few weeks later that I was out walking with Susan.

12:04.893 --> 12:07.789
I was eight or nine months pregnant at the time.

12:07.790 --> 12:08.894
- How are ya?
- Susan.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.928
The landlord and his wife were also coming back.

12:10.929 --> 12:13.766
We bumped into each other on the sidewalk,

12:13.767 --> 12:17.431
and then Sue just brought up the activity that was happening in the house.

12:17.432 --> 12:20.807
Jackie's having some trouble at the house.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.309
When the landlord acted concerned about it,

12:23.310 --> 12:26.463
then I thought, "well, maybe he's not gonna think I'm crazy".

12:26.464 --> 12:29.854
He asked if I had any objection to them..

12:29.855 --> 12:32.766
Bringing in a priest.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.647
So I said, "sure".

12:47.835 --> 12:53.390
I just didn't have a good feeling towards them from the very beginning.

12:53.391 --> 12:56.247
They both seemed to be very cynical about everything,

12:56.248 --> 12:59.668
like they were judging me.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.932
I see you like horror movies.

13:01.933 --> 13:05.745
Uh, those ones are my ex-husband's.

13:05.746 --> 13:07.815
Your ex-husband?

13:07.816 --> 13:09.736
Yeah.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.177
I had a aquarium.

13:12.178 --> 13:16.122
On the bottom, there was a little ornament of a skeleton.

13:16.123 --> 13:19.754
He said that I was bringing death into my house.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.260
Uh, wait I'm sorry?

13:21.261 --> 13:22.809
The skeleton.

13:22.810 --> 13:26.350
That just struck me as odd.

13:26.830 --> 13:30.980
I had a collection of dolls from different countries.

13:30.981 --> 13:36.381
There was one that was a souvenir from the Caribbean.

13:37.721 --> 13:41.441
He said it was a voodoo doll.

13:42.592 --> 13:46.328
By that point, I was feeling very, very uncomfortable.

13:46.329 --> 13:51.630
Seems to me like you are bringing most of this trouble on yourself.

13:51.631 --> 13:57.432
Um, I'll be right back. I just have to go get my son, okay?

13:57.433 --> 13:59.147
Jamie was screaming.

13:59.148 --> 14:02.214
They said my son wasn't acting normal.

14:02.215 --> 14:04.515
And that he was possessed by the devil.

14:04.516 --> 14:06.066
That's why he was crying.

14:06.067 --> 14:10.453
- He doesn't appear to be acting normal.
- He said, "can we bless your son?"

14:10.454 --> 14:12.766
In the name of the Father, the Son..

14:12.767 --> 14:14.950
Jamie just screamed. He didn't want this guy near him.

14:14.951 --> 14:17.744
And the Holy Spirit..

14:17.745 --> 14:20.431
Then he said, "don't you want to bless the unborn too?"

14:20.432 --> 14:22.700
In the name of the Father, the Son..

14:22.701 --> 14:25.735
I do believe in God, but everything they said as far as I

14:25.736 --> 14:31.376
was concerned when they entered that house was ridiculous.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.240
Fish!

14:37.241 --> 14:39.161
Whee!

14:39.773 --> 14:45.673
The following day was gonna be a long
one for me because I had an assignment due.

14:55.424 --> 14:57.364
Hi, Jackie Hernandez?

14:57.365 --> 14:59.437
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm from Social Services.

14:59.438 --> 15:01.978
I'm wondering if you have a moment that I could come in and speak with you.

15:01.979 --> 15:04.538
That just caught me totally off guard, like, you know,

15:04.539 --> 15:07.523
what would social services be doing here?

15:07.524 --> 15:10.552
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

15:10.553 --> 15:12.695
Sorry about the mess.

15:12.696 --> 15:15.026
It was like probably the worst time ever that

15:15.027 --> 15:17.293
they could have knocked on my door and come in.

15:17.294 --> 15:19.522
I hadn't had a chance to clean it that morning.

15:19.523 --> 15:21.487
Jamie had chocolate cupcake on his face.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.490
He was still in his pajamas.

15:23.491 --> 15:26.900
Can I ask why you're here?

15:26.901 --> 15:28.048
We've had a report that..

15:28.049 --> 15:33.840
She said they had a report from, the two priests that I had been..

15:33.841 --> 15:38.041
On hallucinogenics and I was pregnant.

15:38.262 --> 15:39.672
I'm sorry?

15:39.673 --> 15:43.084
It was just so off the wall to me and crazy.

15:43.085 --> 15:48.485
I had never taken any drugs. I wasn't even drinking.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.076
I was worried for my kids.

15:51.077 --> 15:54.882
It is possible to take your children, even if you are a perfect Mother.

15:54.883 --> 15:56.785
That's everything I need for today.

15:56.786 --> 15:58.334
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:58.335 --> 16:01.599
It just taught me the lesson things are better left unsaid.

16:01.600 --> 16:07.360
Because you never know what can happen if you tell people.

16:07.403 --> 16:12.863
I wasn't going to say anything to anybody ever again.

16:15.228 --> 16:20.208
Shortly after that, I had Samantha, my daughter.

16:21.296 --> 16:24.275
I brought her home, and after everything that happened,

16:24.276 --> 16:30.176
I really was hesitant about bringing her there, but I had no choice.

16:34.802 --> 16:37.257
A couple of days later, I return from grocery shopping.

16:37.258 --> 16:40.738
I had the bags in my arm.

16:49.702 --> 16:53.480
It spelled, "get the hell out".

16:53.481 --> 16:56.556
The doors were still locked. Everything else was untouched.

16:56.557 --> 17:00.660
There was no logical explanation, none.

17:00.661 --> 17:05.598
I knew at that point it was not friendly and it didn't want me around.

17:05.599 --> 17:10.579
Because that was definitely directed just at me.

17:18.030 --> 17:22.441
I was afraid of going to sleep because I had to watch over those kids.

17:22.442 --> 17:27.310
And what if I wasn't able to see what was happening to them?

17:27.311 --> 17:30.234
I was sleeping on the daybed.

17:30.235 --> 17:33.082
Jamie was sleeping with me. I was afraid to put him in the bedroom.

17:33.083 --> 17:38.363
And Samantha slept in a little bassinet next to me.

17:42.318 --> 17:47.778
The level of fear built up more and more every night.

17:52.304 --> 17:57.224
I can remember waking up and hearing breathing.

18:01.437 --> 18:05.577
It was loud, and it was distinctive.

18:21.496 --> 18:27.396
I can't even describe the feeling of being as scared as I was.

18:36.915 --> 18:41.295
I saw somebody sitting on the bunk bed.

18:56.306 --> 18:59.906
I was just totally terrified.

19:01.274 --> 19:05.414
I looked up again, and he was gone.

19:15.696 --> 19:21.456
Every single shade in the house went up at the same time.

19:23.938 --> 19:27.418
You can't rationalize that.

19:27.832 --> 19:29.767
I didn't sleep the rest of the night, you know?

19:29.768 --> 19:34.808
I was just trembling all night. I remember that.

19:44.485 --> 19:47.272
It was important for me..

19:47.273 --> 19:50.393
Not to let the kids..

19:51.448 --> 19:53.530
See how frightened I was.

19:53.531 --> 19:57.431
I had to keep it away from him.

19:58.403 --> 20:02.206
I would try not to allow myself to be afraid.

20:02.207 --> 20:06.047
At least pretend like I wasn't.

20:08.265 --> 20:10.934
It is the most helpless feeling.

20:10.935 --> 20:14.745
There's something that's in the house.

20:14.746 --> 20:19.000
That actually was there before you came, so it's not your house.

20:19.001 --> 20:21.912
It's their territory, not yours.

20:21.913 --> 20:24.274
So you're the intruder. That's how I felt.

20:24.275 --> 20:28.115
I felt like I was the intruder.

20:32.824 --> 20:36.527
Listen, you can't go on like this.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.948
You got to get some help.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.613
My friend Susan said that she had a number

20:42.614 --> 20:45.498
that she had gotten that was a Parapsychologist.

20:45.499 --> 20:47.566
You know, I should call him and get some help.

20:47.567 --> 20:49.557
I want you to call him, okay?

20:49.558 --> 20:50.890
No way.

20:50.891 --> 20:53.013
But I said no because of what had happened

20:53.014 --> 20:55.964
the last time I allowed somebody into the house.

20:55.965 --> 20:58.983
I really think you need to call him.

20:58.984 --> 21:02.430
She gave me the number anyway and said, "here, call it when you're ready".

21:02.431 --> 21:06.031
And I put it into a drawer.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.768
Later on, I remember I was doing dishes.

21:12.769 --> 21:15.709
It was pretty late.

21:22.790 --> 21:27.050
My first reaction was, "I cut myself".

21:32.232 --> 21:35.299
But when I turned around.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.508
It was coming out of the cabinets.

21:38.509 --> 21:41.513
It was forming on the glass.

21:41.514 --> 21:44.634
It was all around me.

21:45.151 --> 21:48.494
It was infecting my kitchen.

21:48.495 --> 21:52.695
And I thought I got to do something.

21:55.552 --> 21:59.152
I called the Parapsychologist.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.701
I remember the night that the paranormal team arrived.

22:15.702 --> 22:19.102
My ex-husband happened to be visiting the kids at the time

22:19.103 --> 22:24.323
which was good because he could keep them occupied.

22:24.805 --> 22:30.705
She told me that she had found these people that investigated such happenings.

22:30.815 --> 22:33.035
You okay?

22:34.706 --> 22:37.080
I kind of thought, "why not?"

22:37.081 --> 22:38.907
This is perfect.

22:38.908 --> 22:42.420
These people will come in. They won't find anything.

22:42.421 --> 22:44.399
And we're done with it, you know? And I was ready to

22:44.400 --> 22:49.800
wipe my hands of it and say good-bye, good riddance.

22:50.061 --> 22:52.589
Hi. Come on in.

22:52.590 --> 22:54.932
The Parapsychologist himself came in first.

22:54.933 --> 22:56.853
- Jackie?
- Yes.

22:56.854 --> 23:02.191
After him came this whole herd of people carrying cameras.

23:02.192 --> 23:04.511
That was something I didn't expect. It was like a circus.

23:04.512 --> 23:08.078
Barry, where you gonna want the lights set up?

23:08.079 --> 23:12.081
As a Cameraman, I've been a professional Videographer for many years.

23:12.082 --> 23:15.840
Uh, I thought.. "Well, you know, it's one thing to go into a haunting"

23:15.841 --> 23:18.208
"and hear all of these stories but it's another"

23:18.209 --> 23:20.000
"thing if we could capture something on videotape".

23:20.001 --> 23:22.954
I think any Cameraman worth his salt would say the same thing.

23:22.955 --> 23:24.308
How's that? You think that's a good angle?

23:24.309 --> 23:27.024
I think that's good, yeah.

23:27.025 --> 23:29.679
They already had it pre-planned what they were going to do.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.680
They never informed me of it.

23:31.681 --> 23:34.442
They were going to document it.

23:34.443 --> 23:37.561
I'm sorry. I'm still a little confused as to..

23:37.562 --> 23:39.413
To what's going on.

23:39.414 --> 23:41.931
Just gonna do a quick interview and have you tell us some of the

23:41.932 --> 23:45.321
amazing stuff that you've been experiencing here in the house.

23:45.322 --> 23:48.087
I did not want it documented. I wanted it out of my house.

23:48.088 --> 23:50.261
I wanted it gone. I wanted..

23:50.262 --> 23:52.482
Normality.

23:56.081 --> 24:01.981
So, Jackie, why don't you tell us a little bit about what's going on?

24:02.095 --> 24:04.060
Jackie herself seemed scared.

24:04.061 --> 24:07.545
We wanted to find out what her experiences were in the house.

24:07.546 --> 24:09.881
You can feel a presence? You can sense a presence?

24:09.882 --> 24:11.802
Yeah.

24:14.603 --> 24:17.838
One of the paranormal team was very skeptical.

24:17.839 --> 24:19.340
You could tell by the look on his face.

24:19.341 --> 24:21.442
And Barry Conrad was just the opposite.

24:21.443 --> 24:22.723
Something you can't explain.

24:22.724 --> 24:25.470
Yeah, there's just..

24:25.471 --> 24:31.371
There's something wrong. There's something here all the time.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.122
All of a sudden, the light goes off.

24:34.123 --> 24:37.543
Right during the interview.

24:42.702 --> 24:44.031
Problem with the power?

24:44.032 --> 24:46.064
You know, they're just thinking maybe the electricity went out.

24:46.065 --> 24:47.882
Maybe there was a fuse or whatever.

24:47.883 --> 24:52.383
And I knew.. I knew exactly what it was.

24:54.310 --> 25:00.210
He was angry that these people were in the house, and I just knew that.

25:01.350 --> 25:03.351
Then the light goes back on.

25:03.352 --> 25:04.652
Okay.

25:04.653 --> 25:05.733
It's coming from up there.

25:05.734 --> 25:09.304
I told them about the noises I've heard in the attic.

25:09.305 --> 25:11.526
- From the attic?
- Yeah.

25:11.527 --> 25:14.532
So I remember asking my friend, who was a still photographer,

25:14.533 --> 25:19.125
if he might want to go up there and take a few photos.

25:19.126 --> 25:24.526
Sure. Why not? What else are we here for? Let's go.

25:26.782 --> 25:28.597
He was the one who was very skeptical.

25:28.598 --> 25:31.363
In fact, he whispered in my ear, he says, "it'll be a cool drink in hell"

25:31.364 --> 25:37.264
"before I ever believe that there is a ghost in this house".

25:41.121 --> 25:43.469
You got enough space up there?

25:43.470 --> 25:45.042
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of space.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.888
I was laying there just kind of listening. I was wide awake.

25:47.889 --> 25:51.012
I wasn't sleeping or anything like that.

25:51.013 --> 25:54.253
Nothing but spider webs.

26:00.409 --> 26:06.044
I'm getting goose bumps because I can recall that moment.

26:06.045 --> 26:09.261
I heard something whisper into my ear..

26:09.262 --> 26:11.602
So clearly.

26:12.855 --> 26:17.235
Tell them to get the hell out of here.

26:19.399 --> 26:22.464
Seconds after I heard this.

26:22.465 --> 26:26.605
I heard someone yell from the attic.

26:43.646 --> 26:46.875
I heard something whisper into my ear.

26:46.876 --> 26:48.488
So clearly..

26:48.489 --> 26:52.869
"Tell them to get the hell outta here".

26:55.533 --> 26:58.082
My friend comes bolting down.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.588
All of the color drained out of him.

27:00.589 --> 27:03.024
Something just grabbed the camera right out of my hand, man.

27:03.025 --> 27:04.350
Pulled it right out of my hand.

27:04.351 --> 27:06.429
You sure you didn't, like, just drop it or catch it on something?

27:06.430 --> 27:08.660
Something grabbed my camera.

27:08.661 --> 27:14.435
All of a sudden, all that skepticism that he had before was gone, erased.

27:14.436 --> 27:16.738
He was really, really scared.

27:16.739 --> 27:19.852
But I think that his concern for his livelihood

27:19.853 --> 27:21.847
overcame his fear because this was, you know..

27:21.848 --> 27:24.211
This was how he made his living. He was a still photographer.

27:24.212 --> 27:26.147
I got to get that camera, man.

27:26.148 --> 27:28.725
It's a $2,000 camera. I've got to get it.

27:28.726 --> 27:30.962
I'll come with you. I'll be right behind you, okay?

27:30.963 --> 27:36.863
He decided to go back up into the attic to find his camera.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.218
I put up a 1,000-watt light.

27:47.219 --> 27:51.363
I wanted see every nook and cranny of the attic.

27:51.364 --> 27:53.797
You don't see anything?

27:53.798 --> 27:55.764
No, nothing yet.

27:55.765 --> 27:59.665
I don't see the camera anywhere.

28:03.228 --> 28:06.543
I don't think I shot more than a minute.

28:06.544 --> 28:08.551
The camera completely neutralized.

28:08.552 --> 28:12.632
Can you change the battery on that?

28:12.728 --> 28:15.426
So they changed the battery. And it worked just fine downstairs.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.226
But they pulled it through the hole, and it wouldn't work at all again.

28:18.227 --> 28:20.201
I'm still not getting anything on here.

28:20.202 --> 28:21.669
I thought, "well, how can this be?"

28:21.670 --> 28:25.630
- Is this the new battery?
- Yup.

28:28.639 --> 28:29.806
I got it.

28:29.807 --> 28:31.441
- You found it?
- Yeah.

28:31.442 --> 28:36.499
They finally did find the body of the camera on one corner of the attic.

28:36.500 --> 28:40.282
It was lying face down in a little crate.

28:40.283 --> 28:43.703
The lens had been removed.

28:44.655 --> 28:45.855
I got the lens here.

28:45.856 --> 28:50.116
We found the lens behind the trapdoor.

28:53.037 --> 28:56.040
- So what do we do now?
- Well, we take things back to the lab.

28:56.041 --> 28:57.901
We..

29:01.758 --> 29:07.658
All of a sudden, it's like somebody is walking back and forth up above us.

29:09.649 --> 29:12.648
I knew I'd just been up there. My friend had just been up there.

29:12.649 --> 29:17.749
And there was nobody up in that attic whatsoever.

29:25.383 --> 29:26.812
Did you get that on tape?

29:26.813 --> 29:28.232
Yeah.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.644
We did one final interview with Jackie.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.002
I got to go.

29:33.003 --> 29:37.006
The whole thing was very frightening.

29:37.007 --> 29:40.510
I remember telling my friend, "I think we better get out of here".

29:40.511 --> 29:43.946
It was unbelievable to me that they were getting ready to go and walk out.

29:43.947 --> 29:45.715
So you're just gonna leave me here?

29:45.716 --> 29:47.077
Sorry, lady.

29:47.078 --> 29:49.679
They were gonna get the proof that it was in the house,

29:49.680 --> 29:53.515
and then they were gonna leave? They were gonna rile this up and leave?

29:53.516 --> 29:54.735
- Wait..
- Thank you very much.

29:54.736 --> 29:57.007
We'll be back. Don't worry. There's nothing to worry about.

29:57.008 --> 30:01.808
I started questioning why I even called them.

30:17.039 --> 30:21.235
I got back to my apartment and started looking at the videotapes.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.200
- Here.
- Hear it?

30:23.201 --> 30:25.075
Something's walking back and forth up there.

30:25.076 --> 30:27.397
It is walking, definitely.

30:27.398 --> 30:31.238
Quiet, everyone. Shh, shh! Quiet!

30:32.310 --> 30:33.855
It was amazing.

30:33.856 --> 30:38.300
There was these footsteps coming from above us.

30:38.301 --> 30:44.201
I felt like these were part and parcel to whatever this haunting was.

30:45.870 --> 30:50.145
I was extremely frightened by what I had witnessed.

30:50.146 --> 30:53.986
Quiet, everyone. Shh, shh! Quiet!

30:54.051 --> 30:56.427
Well, I didn't think it was anything you needed to know.

30:56.428 --> 31:00.253
Oh, I'm beginning to understand what's going on here.

31:00.254 --> 31:02.597
The very last night I stayed at that house.

31:02.598 --> 31:06.939
I was on the couch watching TV, and I had both of the kids right next to me.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.743
I haven't even had a chance to take a shower,

31:08.744 --> 31:14.644
and some lawyer starts knocking on my door to serve me with divorce papers.

31:16.272 --> 31:18.635
There was noises coming from the bedroom, and it sounded

31:18.636 --> 31:24.276
as if something was in there playing with my kids' toys.

31:30.754 --> 31:36.654
A beach ball comes out of the room as if somebody just threw it out.

31:38.540 --> 31:43.940
I knew I wasn't gonna be going to sleep that night.

31:44.334 --> 31:46.911
I closed my eyes for a minute, not to go to sleep,

31:46.912 --> 31:51.052
but just to rest them for a second.

32:03.999 --> 32:06.355
Something was holding me down.

32:06.356 --> 32:09.296
I couldn't breathe.

32:10.027 --> 32:14.167
I tried to get up, but I couldn't.

32:14.192 --> 32:17.672
I thought I was gonna die.

32:27.038 --> 32:30.698
Something was holding me down.

32:30.759 --> 32:32.943
I couldn't breathe.

32:32.944 --> 32:36.881
I tried to get up, but I couldn't.

32:36.882 --> 32:41.502
I began to think, "oh, my gosh, the kids".

32:45.758 --> 32:48.458
Then it let go.

32:58.834 --> 33:00.934
Jackie..

33:04.390 --> 33:06.673
I had a baseball bat.

33:06.674 --> 33:08.908
Something snapped inside of me.

33:08.909 --> 33:11.501
I just took the bat and just said, "I had it".

33:11.502 --> 33:14.142
"I had enough".

33:26.734 --> 33:29.599
I was expecting him to appear..

33:29.600 --> 33:33.200
Just like every turn I made.

33:51.044 --> 33:55.866
I realized that that old man's domain was the attic.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.807
That was his space.

34:00.143 --> 34:03.608
I wanted to fight for the house that I was paying to rent.

34:03.609 --> 34:08.722
I wanted it to be me and the kids and nothing else in that house.

34:08.723 --> 34:12.503
That's what drove me up there.

34:12.661 --> 34:15.146
Even though it wasn't a very smart thing to do,

34:15.147 --> 34:19.467
I was just fighting for what was mine.

34:21.152 --> 34:26.732
That was the first time I've ever went into the attic.

34:41.867 --> 34:43.943
Come on and show yourself!

34:43.944 --> 34:45.812
I was confronting it and challenging it.

34:45.813 --> 34:46.913
Come on.

34:46.914 --> 34:50.571
At least give me a fight instead of suffocating me when I'm sleeping.

34:50.572 --> 34:53.152
Where are you?

34:56.071 --> 34:58.231
Come on.

35:10.359 --> 35:13.419
I fell to the floor.

35:18.002 --> 35:23.582
I just grabbed the kids and just ran out of the house.

35:25.149 --> 35:27.387
I was worried I wasn't being able to protect my kids.

35:27.388 --> 35:33.288
I was worried that something would happen, to me and they would find me dead..

35:34.898 --> 35:38.738
Or that I would find them dead.

35:46.299 --> 35:48.328
We're not here. Leave a message.

35:48.329 --> 35:50.833
Barry, it's Jackie.

35:50.834 --> 35:51.845
Jackie?

35:51.846 --> 35:54.641
Suddenly Jackie called my answering machine.

35:54.642 --> 35:55.916
Jackie, is that you?

35:55.917 --> 35:57.565
Please, you got to come help me.

35:57.566 --> 35:59.286
Absolutely terrified out of her mind.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.523
Please, you have to come now. There's something in the house.

36:01.524 --> 36:05.825
As she was talking, she suddenly cried out, and she dropped the phone.

36:05.826 --> 36:09.129
And all of a sudden, the line is cut.

36:09.130 --> 36:10.132
Jackie?

36:10.133 --> 36:11.737
We're like, "Jackie? "You know? "Are you there, Jackie?"

36:11.738 --> 36:15.312
You know? We didn't know what happened. Because she was no longer on the line.

36:15.313 --> 36:21.213
We were so concerned about her we
decided that we better go down and check it out.

36:24.643 --> 36:28.646
I had thought they were gonna take me out of the house, so I was ready to leave.

36:28.647 --> 36:30.216
Please, there's.. No, there's something in the house.

36:30.217 --> 36:32.118
- Please, we need to go now.
- Okay, just calm down.

36:32.119 --> 36:34.611
They bring out all their equipment, their video cameras and everything,

36:34.612 --> 36:40.512
and they go into the house, and I'm thinking, "what are they doing?"

36:40.708 --> 36:42.812
We were all curious. We wanted to know whether

36:42.813 --> 36:47.733
the entity really was in the house that night.

36:49.517 --> 36:54.408
To me, it was my life, and to them, it was making a movie.

36:54.409 --> 36:56.710
I don't hear a thing.

36:56.711 --> 37:01.037
When we walked into the house, there was not a sign of anything.

37:01.038 --> 37:03.082
You want to go upstairs and check out the attic?

37:03.083 --> 37:04.712
The attic?

37:04.713 --> 37:06.633
Yeah.

37:07.668 --> 37:09.296
The same photographer who was..

37:09.297 --> 37:11.353
Already had an incident up in the attic,

37:11.354 --> 37:15.114
he decides to go up again into the attic.

37:15.115 --> 37:16.808
The photographer had a flashlight.

37:16.809 --> 37:21.729
Barry handed me just a small instamatic camera.

37:23.548 --> 37:25.534
And I think when they first went up there, they didn't really

37:25.535 --> 37:31.415
expect anything to happen because it was so quiet downstairs.

37:35.583 --> 37:39.183
It was pitch-black up there.

37:46.838 --> 37:51.431
There was absolutely nothing there. There was nothing in this attic.

37:51.432 --> 37:54.852
What's going on up there?

38:14.079 --> 38:17.415
There was this snapping sound, like somebody snapped their fingers.

38:17.416 --> 38:20.896
Just like that three times.

38:21.169 --> 38:24.650
The sensation of being watched overcame me.

38:24.651 --> 38:27.068
It was really getting stronger.

38:27.069 --> 38:28.751
Something was gonna happen. I knew it.

38:28.752 --> 38:30.700
You need to come down. They need to come down right now.

38:30.701 --> 38:34.492
I start to panic, and I yell, "get down, please!"

38:34.493 --> 38:37.207
- I think you guys better come down.
- They just started yelling and hollering..

38:37.208 --> 38:39.350
"Get down here, You gotta get down here! " There was just pandemonium.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.585
You guys need to get down here.

38:40.586 --> 38:43.137
"You got to come down. Come down now. There's something going on".

38:43.138 --> 38:44.905
- Guys, you got to come down.
- Please come down.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.499
The photographer was literally right behind me,

38:47.500 --> 38:49.022
and I was looking down into the opening.

38:49.023 --> 38:51.262
- What's going on?
- Seriously, guys, I'm not joking.

38:51.263 --> 38:55.855
- Get down here right away.
- We need to get out of here, please?

38:55.856 --> 39:00.476
It was like he was lifted through the air.

39:06.216 --> 39:08.856
Guys, you okay?

39:08.899 --> 39:12.319
What's going on up there?

39:13.913 --> 39:16.793
Are you all right?

39:17.230 --> 39:21.010
There was no response from him.

39:21.011 --> 39:25.214
He was 10, 15 feet off into the distance.

39:25.215 --> 39:28.068
I could tell he was not standing upright.

39:28.069 --> 39:33.523
Very odd, you know? It's like, "why would he be like that?"

39:33.524 --> 39:39.424
The only source of light I had was this little flash on this little camera.

39:40.724 --> 39:42.489
He was completely off the floor of the attic.

39:42.490 --> 39:44.159
His head was off on the opposite angle,

39:44.160 --> 39:49.320
because he was up against the inside of the roof.

39:49.417 --> 39:51.449
There was this completely blank expression on his face.

39:51.450 --> 39:56.910
Like.. Like his eyes were open, but he was not there.

39:56.980 --> 40:02.333
- Very vaguely, he said..
- There's something on my neck.

40:02.334 --> 40:05.034
It was a noose.

40:05.488 --> 40:07.120
There was no way he could've done this himself.

40:07.121 --> 40:09.000
I mean, there wasn't enough time. It had happened just like that.

40:09.001 --> 40:12.841
Guys, what's going on up there?

40:16.626 --> 40:19.849
He's absolutely terrified.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.148
What happened?

40:21.149 --> 40:23.633
He's still got the thing around his neck,

40:23.634 --> 40:28.314
and his neck is all swollen, and it's red.

40:28.574 --> 40:30.140
He just had no reaction any of this happened to him.

40:30.141 --> 40:32.049
It was like it's something that he didn't even know happened.

40:32.050 --> 40:34.304
It was like blank in his memory.

40:34.305 --> 40:36.270
We need to get out of here now. We need to go, please!

40:36.271 --> 40:38.715
At that point, I just wanted to get out of the house right then, right there.

40:38.716 --> 40:42.590
We have to go! Can you carry him, please?

40:42.591 --> 40:47.571
That was the last night I spent in that house.

40:57.775 --> 40:59.633
To this day..

40:59.634 --> 41:04.379
I am mystified by what happened in the house.

41:04.380 --> 41:10.280
I really truly believe we were dealing with some kind of entity.

41:11.274 --> 41:14.354
I never thought I would ever experience something like this, no.

41:14.355 --> 41:18.195
Quiet, everyone. Shh, shh! Quiet!

41:21.985 --> 41:25.897
I'm not gonna tell you that I believe in ghosts now.

41:25.898 --> 41:31.798
But I most definitely have opened my mind to the possibility.

41:49.557 --> 41:50.557
- The light.
- The light.

41:50.558 --> 41:52.838
The light.
