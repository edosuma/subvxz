WEBVTT

00:02.373 --> 00:05.176
(Meredith) THE DICTIONARY
DEFINES GRIEF AS,

00:05.176 --> 00:07.408
"KEEN MENTAL SUFFERING
OR DISTRESS

00:07.408 --> 00:10.041
"OVER AFFLICTION OR LOSS.

00:10.041 --> 00:12.543
"SHARP SORROW.

00:12.543 --> 00:15.386
PAINFUL REGRET."

00:15.386 --> 00:18.349
AS SURGEONS, AS SCIENTISTS,

00:18.349 --> 00:21.552
WE'RE TAUGHT TO LEARN FROM
AND RELY ON BOOKS,

00:21.552 --> 00:23.594
ON DEFINITIONS,

00:23.594 --> 00:25.626
ON DEFINITIVES.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.598
BUT IN LIFE...

00:27.598 --> 00:30.731
STRICT DEFINITIONS
RARELY APPLY.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.663
IN LIFE...

00:32.663 --> 00:35.666
GRIEF CAN LOOK LIKE
A LOT OF THINGS

00:35.666 --> 00:39.340
THAT BEAR LITTLE RESEMBLANCE
TO SHARP SORROW.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.175
(Fanfarlo) ♪ HAVE WE FALLEN
OUT FOR GOOD? ♪

00:44.175 --> 00:49.180
"YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH.
NEW YORK SMELLS LIKE PEE."

00:49.180 --> 00:50.651
GOD, I HATE THEM.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.153
(gasps)

00:52.153 --> 00:53.654
MORE PAIN?

00:53.654 --> 00:56.557
YOUR C.T. RESULTS
SHOULD BE BACK SOON.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.559
I'M FINE.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.792
YOU SHOULD GO HOME TONIGHT.

01:01.792 --> 01:05.096
YOU CAN CALL OFF THE 24-HOUR
SUICIDE WATCH, YOU KNOW?

01:05.096 --> 01:07.098
HONESTLY, I'M BETTER NOW.

01:07.098 --> 01:10.101
I AM.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.474
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

01:13.474 --> 01:15.146
I THINK YOU'RE USING ME

01:15.146 --> 01:17.148
TO AVOID MOVING IN
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

01:17.148 --> 01:18.479
(scoffs) AM NOT.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.452
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL--
YOU MOVE IN WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND,

01:21.452 --> 01:24.415
AND I'LL LET YOU
CALL MY MUM.
OH, MEAN.

01:24.415 --> 01:25.716
CHICKEN.
(chuckles)

01:25.716 --> 01:29.089
OKAY, UH, CLARA,
THE C.T. SHOWS

01:29.089 --> 01:32.563
YOU HAVE AN INFECTION
IN YOUR SMALL BOWEL

01:32.563 --> 01:34.125
AND YOUR COLON IS INFLAMED.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.597
IT'S MOST LIKELY SOMETHING
YOU PICKED UP IN THE WATER.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.870
BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE FORMED
AN ABSCESS,

01:39.870 --> 01:41.872
WHICH MEANS YOU NEED SURGERY
RIGHT AWAY.

01:41.872 --> 01:43.734
NO.

01:43.734 --> 01:47.138
UH, IF WE DON'T GO--
NO.

01:47.138 --> 01:50.781
NO MORE SURGERY.
I'M NOT BEING CUT OPEN AGAIN.

01:50.781 --> 01:52.283
OKAY, UH--
NO.

01:52.283 --> 01:55.115
YOU JUST TAKE A MINUTE.
TAKE A FEW MINUTES.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.548
AND I'LL COME BACK,
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.221
(lowered voice) UM, START HER
ON PRE-OP ANTIBIOTICS

02:00.221 --> 02:02.223
AND BOOK AN O.R.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.295
MM.

02:04.295 --> 02:06.657
WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

02:06.657 --> 02:08.659
CAN YOU GIVE ME DRUGS?
CAN YOU--

02:08.659 --> 02:11.532
NO, YOU NEED SURGERY,
BUT IT'S A SIMPLE PROCEDURE.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.235
AND IF IT ALL GOES
AS PLANNED, YOU SH--

02:14.235 --> 02:18.169
WELL, MY BOAT RIDE DIDN'T
EXACTLY GO AS PLANNED.

02:18.169 --> 02:22.213
SO TELL ME, WORST CASE.

02:24.515 --> 02:28.349
WELL, UH, WORST CASE IS...

02:28.349 --> 02:31.151
THAT WE'D HAVE TO TAKE OUT
A PART OF YOUR COLON

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
AND GIVE YOU A COLOSTOMY BAG--

02:33.153 --> 02:36.357
COLOSTOMY BAG? A POOH BAG
OUTSIDE YOUR BODY?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.659
MY GRANDDAD HAD ONE OF THOSE.
IT WAS--

02:38.659 --> 02:40.861
NO, BUT IT--IT'S A SMALL,
SMALL POSSIBILITY.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.163
NO. NO POOH BAG.
NO SURGERY. NO.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.336
THE INFECTION
WILL KILL YOU, CLARA.

02:45.336 --> 02:46.497
NO.

02:46.497 --> 02:48.499
NO MORE SURGERY.

02:48.499 --> 02:50.941
NO.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.578
WE TRIED PAIN MEDS AND TREATED
HIM FOR PYELONEPHRITIS.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.850
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE
SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS,

02:59.850 --> 03:02.883
SO WE DID A C.M.G.
YOU DID A C.M.G.
FOR A U.T.I.?

03:02.883 --> 03:06.957
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN LOOK
FOR SOMETHING--
BECAUSE WE WERE OUT OF IDEAS.
THE C.M.G. WAS NEGATIVE.

03:06.957 --> 03:09.390
SO WE WENT BACK TO
A POSSIBLE NEUROLOGICAL CAUSE.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.962
SO IF WE COULD GET
A BETTER LOOK,

03:11.962 --> 03:14.925
IF YOU COULD GIVE US PERMISSION
TO GET A 3-D M.R.I.,

03:14.925 --> 03:17.868
WE COULD MAYBE, JUST POSSIBLY--
CHIEF, THIS KID'S BEEN
IN THE E.R. FOUR TIMES

03:17.868 --> 03:20.471
IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS BECAUSE
THE PAIN MEDS AREN'T WORKING.

03:20.471 --> 03:23.234
WHY CAN'T WE JUST--
$5,000, KAREV.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.236
(Alex) SIR?
THAT'S HOW MUCH EITHER YOU
OR DR. ROBBINS

03:25.236 --> 03:27.238
WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP
TO COVER THAT SCAN.

03:27.238 --> 03:29.310
OTHERWISE,
YOU COULD COME WITH ME

03:29.310 --> 03:31.312
TO MY BOARD MEETING
THIS AFTERNOON

03:31.312 --> 03:33.644
AND EXPLAIN WHY
YOU'RE RUNNING THIS HOSPITAL

03:33.644 --> 03:36.917
LIKE IT'S A CHARITY.
(door opens and closes)

03:36.917 --> 03:39.790
DUDE, ARE YOU CRYING?
I HAVE AUTHORITY ISSUES.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.623
(elevator bell dings)
WALK AWAY, KAREV.

03:48.399 --> 03:51.762
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF
KILLING MY PATIENTS, YANG?
KILLING YOUR--

03:51.762 --> 03:53.704
WHEN YOU
TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF

03:53.704 --> 03:56.637
TO TALK THAT GIRL
OUT OF A LIFESAVING SURGERY,

03:56.637 --> 03:58.739
YOU'RE KILLING HER.
I DIDN'T TALK HER...

03:58.739 --> 04:00.811
SHE HAD QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE SURGERY.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.973
YOU LEFT THE ROOM.
NO, I LEFT THE ROOM

04:02.973 --> 04:06.016
TO GIVE A VERY FRAGILE,
VERY DISTRAUGHT PATIENT

04:06.016 --> 04:08.849
TIME AND SPACE TO ACCEPT
WHAT'S BEING ASKED OF HER.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.851
THEN AND ONLY THEN
WOULD I HAVE DISCUSSED

04:10.851 --> 04:12.853
THE POSSIBLE RISKS WITH,
I'M CERTAIN,

04:12.853 --> 04:15.326
MORE TACT AND SENSITIVITY
THAN YOU HAVE EVER DISPLAYED

04:15.326 --> 04:17.928
IN ALL THE TIME
THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU.
SHE ASKED--

04:17.928 --> 04:19.930
NO. I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE ASKED YOU.

04:19.930 --> 04:23.294
AND IF SHE ASKS YOU ANYTHING
ELSE, YOUR ONLY ANSWER WILL BE,

04:23.294 --> 04:25.035
"LET ME ASK MY ATTENDING."

04:35.045 --> 04:38.048
THESE ARE GOOD. DO THEY
SELL THESE IN THE CAFETERIA?

04:38.048 --> 04:39.550
(Meredith) NO.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.552
NO, THOSE ARE
THE CANCER POPS.

04:41.552 --> 04:44.014
WHY DO CANCER PEOPLE
GET ALL THE FUN?

04:46.487 --> 04:49.520
HOW DO YOU FEEL, IZ?
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD

04:49.520 --> 04:51.892
TO THE HURLING THAT'S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN, BUT I FEEL OKAY.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.565
I FEEL GOOD.
BAILEY'S ON SOME SORT
OF RAMPAGE.

04:54.565 --> 04:57.067
I THINK IT'S POST-O'MALLEY
STRESS DISORDER. (laughs)

04:57.067 --> 04:58.769
(elevator bell dings)

04:58.769 --> 05:01.001
SHE'S NOT DEALING
WITH HER GRIEF.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.874
YOU SOUND LIKE OWEN'S SHRINK.
OWEN'S SHRINK...

05:03.874 --> 05:07.878
IS WITHHOLDING SEX, SO SHE
IS GRUMPY AND INAPPROPRIATE.

05:07.878 --> 05:10.381
IS DEREK DOING THAT, TOO,
WITHHOLDING SEX?

05:10.381 --> 05:14.084
WHY WOULD DEREK
WITHHOLD SEX?
ALEX IS WITHHOLDING...
EVERYTHING.

05:14.084 --> 05:16.947
IT'S LIKE HE'S AFRAID, BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S AFRAID OF.

05:16.947 --> 05:19.750
HE'S AFRAID
OF THE CANCER SEX.
CRISTINA!

05:19.750 --> 05:23.053
HE DOESN'T WANT TO END UP
WITH A CANCER POP.
CRISTINA!

05:23.053 --> 05:25.996
JUST SHUT THE HELL UP.
I'M NOT CONTAGIOUS, CRISTINA.

05:25.996 --> 05:29.400
I KNOW THAT. I WOULD TOTALLY
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.831
(elevator bell dings)

05:30.831 --> 05:32.833
REALLY? NOTHING?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.835
NO.
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT
A DRAWER?

05:34.835 --> 05:38.108
(chuckles) NO.
HOW ABOUT A TOOTHBRUSH,
CHANGE OF PANTIES?

05:38.108 --> 05:40.070
NO.
DAMN. I LIKE YOUR PANTIES.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.072
I AM TRYING TO FOCUS.

05:42.072 --> 05:44.114
I'M--I'M BECOMING
A RESIDENT TODAY.

05:44.114 --> 05:47.818
I NEED TO FOCUS.
I'M RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

05:47.818 --> 05:50.451
IF YOU CRASH HERE SOMETIMES,
YOU'LL GET A JUMP

05:50.451 --> 05:52.923
ON A LOT OF SURGERIES.
OKAY, OKAY. WHICH ONE?

05:52.923 --> 05:55.726
IT'S MY FIRST DAY AT MERCY WEST,
AND I WANT TO LOOK NICE.

05:55.726 --> 05:57.758
YOU KNOW, SERIOUS, TALENTED,
HARD-CORE,

05:57.758 --> 05:59.660
NOT SOMEONE YOU PUSH AROUND.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.732
NICE BUT HOT...

06:01.732 --> 06:03.934
LIKE ME.

06:03.934 --> 06:07.137
THAT ONE.
REALLY?
I THOUGHT THIS ONE.

06:07.137 --> 06:10.040
MNH-MNH. TOO HOT.
BETTER FOR A DATE. THAT ONE.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.073
OKAY. HERE.
CAN YOU--THANKS.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.945
(sighs)
(zipper unzips)

06:22.082 --> 06:24.084
(sighs) OKAY.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.087
OKAY. LESS HOT?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.919
LESS HOT.

06:28.919 --> 06:31.862
OKAY. (laughs) OKAY, OKAY.
GOOD. THANKS. WISH ME LUCK.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.965
OR NOT LUCK, 'CAUSE I'M
ALL TALENTED AND HARD-CORE.

06:34.965 --> 06:37.868
YOU'RE AN ATTENDING, TORRES.
GO KICK SOME ASS.

06:37.868 --> 06:42.002
(laughs)

06:42.002 --> 06:44.475
SO, UM...
(door closes)

06:44.475 --> 06:47.077
DID YOU FORGET TO MENTION
THAT YOUR HOT,

06:47.077 --> 06:51.912
HARD-CORE EX-SEX-FRIEND
LIVES RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.814
DID I?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.146
YEAH. YEAH, YOU DID.

06:56.146 --> 06:59.890
AND IT IS ONLY UNDER
MY TENURE AS CHIEF

06:59.890 --> 07:03.093
THAT SEATTLE GRACE HAS GROWN
INTO ONE OF THE MOST RENOWNED,

07:03.093 --> 07:06.897
LAUDED AND SOUGHT-AFTER
SURGICAL CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY.

07:06.897 --> 07:09.159
REPLACING ME...

07:09.159 --> 07:10.901
NO. NO, NO.

07:10.901 --> 07:13.934
DISRUPTING THAT PROCESS
WOULD BE AN EPIC MISTAKE.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.937
IT IS FOR THAT REASON
THAT I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY

07:16.937 --> 07:19.610
AND SAY
WITH THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE

07:19.610 --> 07:21.612
THAT THERE IS NO ONE
WHO UNDERSTANDS

07:21.612 --> 07:24.144
AND CARES MORE
ABOUT SEATTLE GRACE THAN...

07:24.144 --> 07:26.146
(metal crunches,
engine hisses)

07:26.146 --> 07:27.848
THAN ME.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.520
(metal clatters on pavement)

07:37.658 --> 07:39.960
LOOK, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M FINE. IT'S A SPRAINED ANKLE,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.763
AND--AND I HAVE A MEETING
I HAVE TO GET TO.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.765
LOOK, I SAID I'M FINE.
CHIEF?

07:44.765 --> 07:46.767
TORRES. THANK GOD.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.769
YOU WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.771
OH, IT WAS MINOR.
I RAN A RED LIGHT.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.773
I WAS DISTRACTED.
I AM FINE.

07:52.773 --> 07:56.747
CAN WE MAKE THIS QUICK?
I HAVE A MEETING WITH THE BOARD.

07:56.747 --> 07:59.079
HMM. OKAY. LET'S SEE.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.882
OOH.
OOH, I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.654
THIS LAC LOOKS PRETTY DEEP.

08:03.654 --> 08:05.816
YOU'LL DEFINITELY
NEED STITCHES.

08:05.816 --> 08:08.488
(groans)
AND THE ANKLE--OH, YIKES.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.820
MM.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.922
YEAH.
YOU COULD NEED SURGERY.

08:11.922 --> 08:13.924
IT'S--IT'S A SPRAIN,
TORRES. (groaning)

08:13.924 --> 08:15.225
YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

08:15.225 --> 08:18.028
YEAH. DR. WEBBER AND I
GO WAY BACK, HUH?

08:18.028 --> 08:20.200
WE WORKED TOGETHER FOR,
WHAT WAS IT, FIVE, SIX YEARS?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.202
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I HATE TO SAY IT,

08:22.202 --> 08:25.075
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HAVE THAT LAC REPAIRED.
(groans)

08:25.075 --> 08:27.177
AND THIS BEING
A TEACHING HOSPITAL,

08:27.177 --> 08:29.179
NOT TO MENTION
DR. McKEE'S FIRST DAY,

08:29.179 --> 08:31.912
I HAVE TO LET HIM WORK YOU UP.
SO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO SUTURES,

08:31.912 --> 08:33.844
RIGHT, DR. McKEE?
DAMN STRAIGHT.

08:33.844 --> 08:36.887
GREAT.
GOOD SEEING YOU, CHIEF.

08:36.887 --> 08:39.049
LOOK, DOC--D--
SHE'S, UH,

08:39.049 --> 08:41.722
SHE'S JUST KIDDING ABOUT THIS
BEING MY FIRST DAY.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.994
IT'S, UH, IT'S MY EIGHTH.

08:43.994 --> 08:46.997
WHAT KIND OF SUTURES
ARE YOU USING?
UH, 3-0 NYLON?

08:46.997 --> 08:48.859
NO, NO, NO.
USE DERMABOND.

08:48.859 --> 08:50.861
IT TAKES LESS TIME
AND IT HEALS QUICKER.

08:50.861 --> 08:53.664
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, LIKE,
BUDGET CUTS, YOU KNOW?

08:53.664 --> 08:55.906
(siren wailing)

08:55.906 --> 08:59.570
YOU LIKE WORKING IN THIS PLACE,
DOCTOR, UM, McKEE?

08:59.570 --> 09:03.143
I MEAN, YOU THINK
IT'S A STRONG PROGRAM?
YEAH, IT ROCKS.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.646
LIKE, DAY EIGHT, AND I'M DOING
UNSUPERVISED PROCEDURES?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.818
NOT TOO SHABBY.

09:07.818 --> 09:11.081
MM-HMM. NOT TOO SHABBY.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.096
UH, HE TRAINED AT NORTHWESTERN
AND THEN AT HARVARD.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.568
UH, HE GREW UP LIKE
FIVE MILES AWAY FROM HERE.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.100
UM, NOT RICH, NOT POOR.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.743
COMFORTABLE AND WELL-LOVED
BY HIS PARENTS,

09:32.743 --> 09:35.746
BUT, UM, UH, ITCHING TO DO
SOMETHING MORE WITH HIS LIFE,

09:35.746 --> 09:38.048
WHICH IS WHEN HE ENLISTED,
AT THE AGE OF--

09:38.048 --> 09:40.651
CRISTINA, THIS IS NOT
A BOOK REPORT.

09:40.651 --> 09:42.012
(chuckles)

09:42.012 --> 09:44.014
I'M TRYING
TO EXPLAIN TO DR. WYATT

09:44.014 --> 09:46.586
THAT I KNOW THINGS ABOUT YOU.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.089
CRISTINA--
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HE KNOWS
THINGS ABOUT ME, TOO,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.061
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
'CAUSE WE TALK.

09:51.061 --> 09:53.924
I MEAN, WE TALK ALL THE TIME.
HONEY?

09:53.924 --> 09:56.697
(laughs) "HONEY"?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.829
CRISTINA, LET ME BE CLEAR.

09:58.829 --> 10:00.831
IT'S NOT JUST THAT I WANT
THE TWO OF YOU

10:00.831 --> 10:02.803
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

10:02.803 --> 10:06.136
IT'S THAT I WANT OWEN
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YOU.

10:06.136 --> 10:08.138
OH, HE IS COMFORTABLE
WITH ME.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.112
IT'S FINE.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.115
YOU CAN TALK TO HER.
IT'S FINE.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.187
(Wyatt) OKAY.

10:17.187 --> 10:19.389
CRISTINA, UM,
HE TALKS TO YOU,

10:19.389 --> 10:21.051
HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH YOU.

10:21.051 --> 10:25.255
DOES HE TALK TO YOU
ABOUT HIS TRAUMA?

10:25.255 --> 10:30.000
DOES OWEN TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE WAR?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.704
DOES HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE INCIDENT BETWEEN YOU TWO--

10:33.704 --> 10:37.067
THE CHOKING?

10:37.067 --> 10:41.211
OWEN'S POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS
IS FED...

10:41.211 --> 10:44.815
BY HIS AVOIDANCE OF TALKING
ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE WAR.

10:44.815 --> 10:47.217
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE, TO HEAL,

10:47.217 --> 10:51.181
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO START
TALKING ABOUT IT,

10:51.181 --> 10:53.123
TO YOU AND TO ME.

10:53.123 --> 10:55.726
AND MY CONCERN IS,

10:55.726 --> 10:59.890
IF YOU GET LOST
IN THE LUST OF IT ALL,

10:59.890 --> 11:01.962
HE WON'T HAVE TO MAKE
A START.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.065
HE WON'T HAVE
ANY REASON TO.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.067
HE'LL FEEL THAT HE HAS
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS

11:07.067 --> 11:09.399
UNTIL HE DOESN'T.

11:09.399 --> 11:13.844
SO... I'M ASKING YOU

11:13.844 --> 11:15.906
TO WAIT.

11:17.708 --> 11:20.711
(monitor beeping rapidly)

11:22.853 --> 11:24.684
FINISHED.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.187
(exhales)
READ IT BACK TO ME.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.159
"HI, MOM.
PLEASE PREPARE YOURSELF,

11:29.159 --> 11:31.161
"BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA BE
DIFFICULT TO READ.

11:31.161 --> 11:33.323
I'VE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT."
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

11:33.323 --> 11:36.696
"I'VE SUFFERED TERRIBLE INJURIES
AND 17 SURGERIES."
YOU CAN'T SEND THAT TO HER.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.200
"CURRENTLY, I'M SUFFERING
FROM AN ABDOMINAL INFECTION,

11:40.200 --> 11:43.373
"WHICH I'VE REFUSED TO TREAT,
SO I'M GONNA DIE SOON.

11:43.373 --> 11:45.075
"PLEASE COME QUICKLY, MOM,

11:45.075 --> 11:47.207
"AND IF I'M GONE
BEFORE YOU GET HERE,

11:47.207 --> 11:50.340
"I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU"...
STOP IT.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.814
"AND TO THANK YOU
FOR MAKING ME FROM SCRATCH."
BITCH. YOU'RE A BITCH.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.286
I CAN HIT THE CALL BUTTON
AND I CAN HAVE THE NURSES

11:56.286 --> 11:58.488
IN HERE
TO TAKE YOU INTO SURGERY,

11:58.488 --> 12:02.352
OR I CAN HIT "SEND"--
THAT'S THE DEAL.
I WILL SUE YOU. I WILL SUE
YOU AND THIS HOSPITAL.

12:02.352 --> 12:04.324
NO, YOU WON'T.
YOU'LL BE DEAD.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.156
PLEASE.

12:06.156 --> 12:07.257
PLEASE.

12:07.257 --> 12:11.101
(bell dinging)

12:11.101 --> 12:13.463
HELLO. THE NURSES SAID
YOU CALLED FOR ME?

12:13.463 --> 12:15.836
THIS IS ANDY.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.307
ANDY MICHAELSON.

12:17.307 --> 12:20.170
I'M SORRY. HAVE I
TREATED YOU BEFORE?

12:20.170 --> 12:22.773
DR. ARIZONA ROBBINS
REFERRED US.
OH.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.215
OH, ANDY. OH, YOU'RE THE--

12:25.215 --> 12:27.247
YOU'RE THE KID WITH THE--
WITH THE THING
NO ONE CAN DIAGNOSE.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.219
YEAH, THAT'S US.
(chuckles)

12:29.219 --> 12:32.182
OKAY, SO DR. ROBBINS SENT YOU
HERE TO MERCY WEST BECAUSE...

12:32.182 --> 12:34.124
THESE ARE COPIES

12:34.124 --> 12:36.486
OF ANDY'S PAPERWORK
FROM SEATTLE GRACE.

12:36.486 --> 12:38.188
(paper rustles)

12:38.188 --> 12:40.460
WE DON'T SLEEP ANYMORE.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.834
WE BASICALLY JUST GO
TO THE HOSPITAL, YOU KNOW?

12:43.834 --> 12:46.166
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.999
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE
A TERRIBLE MOTHER.
MOM.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.201
I FEEL LIKE A TERRIBLE MOTHER
BECAUSE I'M SUPPOSED TO...

12:51.201 --> 12:53.173
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETHING,
AND I CAN'T.
MOM.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.345
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GO
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.307
I MAJORED IN FREAKIN' HISTORY.

12:57.307 --> 13:00.150
Y-YOU'RE THE DOCTORS, YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE THE DOCTORS.

13:00.150 --> 13:03.383
AND BASICALLY, ALL WE'VE
BEEN DOING UP TO THIS POINT,

13:03.383 --> 13:06.416
ANY OF US, ALL WE'VE BEEN DOING
IS GETTING MY KID

13:06.416 --> 13:08.118
STRUNG OUT ON THESE PAIN MEDS.
MOM, STOP.

13:08.118 --> 13:11.261
I CAN'T, ANDY.
I CAN'T STOP.

13:11.261 --> 13:14.094
WE DON'T SLEEP.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.566
HE CAN'T SLEEP.

13:16.566 --> 13:20.200
WE CAN'T SLEEP.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.272
AND I'M SCARED.

13:22.272 --> 13:26.036
AND DR. ROBBINS SAID THAT WHAT
SHE NEEDS FOR YOU TO GIVE US

13:26.036 --> 13:28.038
IS A 3-D M.R.I. OF HIS SPINE.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.941
AND SHE SAID
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO

13:30.941 --> 13:32.983
BECAUSE THERE'S NO INDICATION
OR WHATEVER,

13:32.983 --> 13:34.985
BUT SHE SAYS
THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDS.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.317
PLEASE.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
I CAN'T BE THIS USELESS.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.451
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEITHER CAN YOU.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.226
PLEASE.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.527
(suction whooshing)

13:47.527 --> 13:49.529
THAT'S A LOT
OF NECROTIC SMALL BOWEL.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.501
(Lexie) CAN YOU SAVE
ANY OF IT?

13:51.501 --> 13:53.203
YESTERDAY I COULD HAVE.

13:53.203 --> 13:56.206
YESTERDAY THIS WOULD'VE BEEN
A SIMPLE DRAINAGE.

13:56.206 --> 13:59.539
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE DR. YANG
THREATENED MY PATIENT

13:59.539 --> 14:02.242
WITH A COLOSTOMY

14:02.242 --> 14:04.244
THAT THANKFULLY
WILL NOT BE NECESSARY,

14:04.244 --> 14:07.047
BECAUSE IT DID NOT
ACTUALLY INVOLVE THE COLON.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.419
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:09.419 --> 14:11.281
HOW CAN I HELP?

14:11.281 --> 14:13.623
OH, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

14:19.229 --> 14:22.232
SHE ASKED ME A QUESTION.
I WAS RIGHT TO ANSWER IT.

14:22.232 --> 14:23.533
I DID MY JOB.

14:23.533 --> 14:25.535
A PATIENT ASKED ME
TO DISCLOSE THE RISKS

14:25.535 --> 14:27.197
OF A SURGICAL PROCEDURE,

14:27.197 --> 14:31.071
AND I AM REQUIRED BY LAW
AND MY OATH TO DO SO.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.603
IF YOU KNOW A WAY TO SUGARCOAT
A COLOSTOMY BAG,

14:33.603 --> 14:35.605
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT.

14:35.605 --> 14:38.208
IF YOU KNOW
A MORE RESPECTFUL WAY

14:38.208 --> 14:40.880
TO SPEAK
TO AN ATTENDING SURGEON,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.182
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.055
UNTIL YOU DO,
YOU DON'T TALK TO ME.

14:45.055 --> 14:47.387
YOU'RE OFF MY SERVICE.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.119
OKAY, OKAY, SERIOUSLY?

14:49.119 --> 14:51.621
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

15:03.233 --> 15:05.235
(Mark) MORE SUITS?

15:05.235 --> 15:07.277
IT'S FREAKING PEOPLE OUT.

15:07.277 --> 15:10.080
MM.
THERE'S TALK OF DOWNSIZING,
CORPORATE TAKEOVERS,

15:10.080 --> 15:12.342
RUMORS THAT WEBBER'S
JUMPING SHIP.

15:12.342 --> 15:16.216
YOU'VE GOT THE CHIEF'S EAR.
WHAT'S HE GOT PLANNED?

15:16.216 --> 15:18.548
(man) HERE'S THE TEST.
(woman) THANK YOU.

15:18.548 --> 15:21.151
(sighs) HE'S RETIRING.

15:21.151 --> 15:23.423
THEY'RE MAKING ME CHIEF.
NO.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.125
YEAH.
REALLY?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.426
(chuckles) YEAH.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.128
REALLY?
YEP.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.429
WOW.
MM-HMM.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.062
I MEAN, THE CHIEF NEVER
SAID ANYTHING TO ME.

15:32.062 --> 15:34.204
I WOULD'VE
FOUGHT YOU HARD FOR THAT.

15:34.204 --> 15:37.107
WELL, I GUESS IF THAT'S
WHAT HE WANTS...

15:37.107 --> 15:40.110
I GUESS, UH,
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.241
(laughs)

15:41.241 --> 15:43.213
(elevator bell dings)

15:43.213 --> 15:44.514
WAIT, THAT WAS...
(laughs)

15:44.514 --> 15:47.217
YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME?
IT'S JUST TOO EASY.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.219
OH. YOU GOT A MEAN STREAK,
YOU KNOW THAT?

15:49.219 --> 15:51.081
YEAH.
MEAN.

15:51.081 --> 15:54.554
(Mark sighs)
SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:54.554 --> 15:58.128
I HAVE NO IDEA.

15:58.128 --> 15:59.689
(tapping)

15:59.689 --> 16:02.132
(sighs)

16:02.132 --> 16:04.164
(lock clicks)

16:04.164 --> 16:05.465
(keys jangle)

16:05.465 --> 16:08.698
OH, I HAVE WINE--
WHITE AND RED.

16:08.698 --> 16:11.301
AND I HAVE CIGARETTES,
WHICH IS AWFUL, I KNOW.

16:11.301 --> 16:14.204
BUT I ONLY SMOKE 'EM VERY,
VERY, VERY OCCASIONALLY,

16:14.204 --> 16:17.177
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN I KNOW I'M
GONNA BE IN TROUBLE, LIKE NOW.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.478
IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE,

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
NOT TO MENTION MANIPULATIVE
AND STUPID.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.353
YOU SMOKE?
I KNOW. OKAY, LISTEN.

16:23.353 --> 16:26.256
I KNOW YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME,

16:26.256 --> 16:29.359
BUT I RAN OUT OF OPTIONS, SO--
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE TEST. THERE
WAS NO INDICATION TO DO IT.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.321
THERE'S A REASON
WEBBER TURNED YOU DOWN!

16:31.321 --> 16:33.193
SO YOU DIDN'T DO IT?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.195
OF COURSE I DID IT,
ARIZONA.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.696
THANK YOU.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.699
NO. DON'T THANK ME YET.
THE SCAN DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.701
WHAT?! COME ON, NOTHING?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.773
NO.

16:43.773 --> 16:46.776
OKAY, NOW THAT. THAT LOOKS
A LITTLE FUNNY TO ME.
I THOUGHT SO, TOO,

16:46.776 --> 16:49.279
BUT THE RADIOLOGIST
SAID IT'S NORMAL.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.312
(sighs and mutters)
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
JUST... HERE.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.186
IS THERE ANYTHING PECULIAR
ABOUT HIS H&P?

18:14.224 --> 18:17.397
I'M WISHING ALL THE TIME
FOR A GIANT TUMOR

18:17.397 --> 18:19.369
THAT WOULD JUST PRESS DOWN
ON MY BRAIN

18:19.369 --> 18:22.172
AND MAKE ME
HALLUCINATE GEORGE...

18:22.172 --> 18:25.175

I COULD TALK TO HIM AGAIN,

18:25.175 --> 18:27.177
SO I COULD LAUGH
WITH HIM AGAIN.

18:27.177 --> 18:29.609
I...

18:29.609 --> 18:31.681
I MISS HIM...

18:31.681 --> 18:33.383

18:42.392 --> 18:43.693
JUST FOR ONE MINUTE.

18:43.693 --> 18:46.396
AND I CAN'T DRINK
BECAUSE OF THE CANCER MEDS.

18:46.396 --> 18:49.559
I DON'T DO DRUGS.
I CAN'T EVEN WORK RIGHT NOW.

18:49.559 --> 18:51.561
I DON'T HAVE
ANY DISTRACTIONS.

18:51.561 --> 18:55.265
I'M SAD...

19:45.415 --> 19:47.717
HE'S IN THE SHOWER.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.659
OH, THANKS.

19:49.659 --> 19:51.461
HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING

19:51.461 --> 19:54.264

19:54.264 --> 19:56.496
THERE'S ALL THESE RUMORS
FLOATING AROUND MERCY WEST,

19:56.496 --> 20:00.300
LIKE HE MIGHT BE COMING
TO WORK FOR US.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.932
THAT WOULD NOT
GO WELL FOR ME.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
I'LL CHECK WITH DEREK AGAIN.

20:02.932 --> 20:05.875
THANKS.
CAN YOU HAND ME
THE SHAMPOO?

20:05.875 --> 20:08.908

MM-HMM.

20:11.381 --> 20:14.344
ARE YOU REALLY GAY?

20:14.344 --> 20:16.816
LIKE, HOW GAY ARE YOU,

20:16.816 --> 20:19.949
ON A SCALE OF--OF 1 TO GAY?

20:19.949 --> 20:23.323
'CAUSE THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND
IN--IN THE SHOWER,

20:23.323 --> 20:26.456
MY HOT, HOT, NAKED BOYFRIEND,
AND I...

20:26.456 --> 20:28.558
HO-HOW GAY ARE YOU?

20:28.558 --> 20:31.661
(laughs) I'M SORRY. IT'S...
I'VE KNOWN MARK A WHILE, AND--

20:31.661 --> 20:35.305
BUT I'LL... I'LL TRY
NOT TO DO THAT AGAIN--

20:35.305 --> 20:37.267
THE NAKED
IN THE SHOWER THING.

20:37.267 --> 20:40.570
OR--OR THE YOU HALF-NAKED
IN THE HALLWAY THING?

20:40.570 --> 20:42.672
'CAUSE--'CAUSE EVEN IF
YOU REALLY ARE GAY,

20:42.672 --> 20:46.346
HE--HE'S NOT,
AND--AND YOU'RE HOT.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.349
(water running)

20:50.780 --> 20:53.783
HE DOESN'T LOOK
AT MY BOOBS ANYMORE.

20:53.783 --> 20:57.287
THE FIRST THING
HE USED TO LOOK AT

20:57.287 --> 20:59.889
WHEN I WALKED IN ANYWHERE
WAS MY BOOBS.

20:59.889 --> 21:02.332
HE DOESN'T LOOK ANYMORE,

21:02.332 --> 21:04.263
NOT SINCE HE MET YOU.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.436
OKAY?

21:06.436 --> 21:08.468
OKAY.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.345
SHEPHERD.

21:15.345 --> 21:17.347
YOU'RE A HARD MAN
TO TRACK DOWN.

21:17.347 --> 21:18.808
I'M BUSY, AS YOU KNOW.

21:18.808 --> 21:20.380
YEAH, SCOPING OUT
MERCY WEST.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.482
YOU PLANNING
ON JUMPING SHIP?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.854
'CAUSE I ASSUME, AS A FRIEND,
YOU WOULD TELL ME

21:24.854 --> 21:26.856
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW.

21:26.856 --> 21:28.358
THOSE ARE RUMORS, DEREK.

21:28.358 --> 21:30.460
THERE ARE A LOT OF RUMORS.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.393
AND JENNINGS ISN'T ANSWERING
MY CALLS ANYMORE.
WHY ARE YOU
CALLING JENNINGS, DEREK?

21:33.393 --> 21:35.395
I TOLD YOU
I WOULD FILL YOU IN

21:35.395 --> 21:37.427
WHEN THERE WAS
SOMETHING TO TELL.

21:37.427 --> 21:40.830
IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO GO
BEHIND MY BACK, AT LEAST DO ME--
BEHIND YOUR BACK?

21:40.830 --> 21:45.004
BEHIND YOUR BACK? I'M THE ONE
WHO'S GOT YOUR BACK.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.576
DON'T YOU FORGET THAT.

21:46.576 --> 21:49.308
(door opens and closes)

21:49.308 --> 21:50.610
DR. SHEPHERD.
YES.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.582
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
FOR WHAT?

21:52.582 --> 21:54.344
A KID WITH
A TETHERED SPINAL CORD.

21:54.344 --> 21:57.347
I JUST SAT UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT, AND I THOUGHT,

21:57.347 --> 22:00.319
TETHERED SPINAL CORD, BUT YOU'RE
NOT GONNA SEE IT ON THERE.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.622
I NEED TO RUN ANOTHER TEST
TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS.
A TETHERED CORD'S PRETTY RARE.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.694
DOES HE HAVE A HISTORY
OF SPINA BIFIDA?
NO.

22:04.694 --> 22:07.326
LOWER BACK LESIONS,
HYPERREFLEXIA?
NO AND NO,
BUT THE PAIN IS AGGRAVATED

22:07.326 --> 22:09.959
WHEN HE EXTENDS
OR FLEXES HIS SPINE.

22:09.959 --> 22:13.002
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY--
THAT THE TETHERED CORD SHOULD'VE

22:13.002 --> 22:15.104
SHOWN UP ON THE M.R.I.,
BUT WHAT IF IT DIDN'T?

22:15.104 --> 22:17.767
WHAT IF WHAT THIS KID NEEDS
IS NOT ANOTHER M.R.I.

22:17.767 --> 22:20.339
BUT A MUCH MORE SPECIFIC
C.T. MYELOGRAM?
MAYBE. ORDER ONE.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.342
WELL, SEE, I CAN'T, BECAUSE IF
I DID, I'D GET FIRED...

22:23.342 --> 22:26.115
AND I REALLY...
(whispers) LIKE MY JOB.
DID THE CHIEF
DENY THAT REQUEST?

22:26.115 --> 22:28.117
(normal voice) SEVERAL TIMES.

22:28.117 --> 22:31.421
YOU SHOULDA LED WITH THE PART
ABOUT THE CHIEF. COME ON.

22:31.421 --> 22:33.423
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
YOU'RE UP, GIRL. I KNOW.

22:33.423 --> 22:35.925
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT STANDING
COULD BE SO HARD, RIGHT?

22:35.925 --> 22:38.127
YOU'RE DOING AWESOME.
AWESOME.

22:38.127 --> 22:41.461
PUT ME DOWN.
LET'S GO A COUPLE OF
MORE SECONDS. YOU'RE DOING--

22:41.461 --> 22:43.463
PUT ME DOWN. (grunts)
THAT WAS GREAT.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.395
TAKE A SEC, AND THEN
GO AGAIN FOR ME, OKAY?
NO.

22:45.395 --> 22:49.098
I KNOW, CLARA. BUT THIS IS
WHERE THE HARD PART BEGINS.

22:55.605 --> 22:57.607
(scanner whirring)

22:57.607 --> 22:58.608
HMM.

22:58.608 --> 23:02.151
(scanner banging)

23:02.151 --> 23:03.683
McDREAMY.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.515
I'M SORRY?

23:05.515 --> 23:07.016
I GET IT NOW--

23:07.016 --> 23:09.419
THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW,
McDREAMY THING.

23:09.419 --> 23:11.160
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T
GET IT BEFORE.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.692
BUT NOW I GET IT.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.825
YOU KNOW THEY CALL YOU THAT,
RIGHT?

23:15.825 --> 23:17.396
YES.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.899
I'M INVOLVED, BY THE WAY,

23:19.899 --> 23:22.432
IN CASE YOU THOUGHT THAT I WAS
JUST COMING ON TO YOU,

23:22.432 --> 23:23.933
BECAUSE I WAS NOT.

23:23.933 --> 23:25.905
PLUS, WELL, I HEARD
THAT YOU GOT MARRIED.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.538
SO CONGRATULATIONS.
YES, THANK YOU.

23:28.538 --> 23:31.140
(laughs) YOU WROTE SOME
HOKEY CRAP ON A POST-IT NOTE

23:31.140 --> 23:33.012
IN THE RESIDENT'S LOUNGE.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.945
SORRY, BUT UNTIL YOU'RE SWEATING
IT OUT IN A MORNING COAT

23:35.945 --> 23:38.718
WITH A BALL OF WHITE TAFFETA
COMING AT YOU,

23:38.718 --> 23:41.420
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MARRIED.
(chuckles) OH, OKAY.
WELL, I'VE CONSUMMATED MINE.

23:41.420 --> 23:45.154
I CONSUMMATE MINE ALL THE TIME.
HOW'S THAT GOING FOR YOU, KAREV?

23:45.154 --> 23:47.527
GIRLS TALK. YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CONSIDER THAT

23:47.527 --> 23:50.129
THE NEXT TIME
YOU JUDGE MY POST-IT.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.131
(paper rustles)

23:52.131 --> 23:56.105
(Meredith sighs and taps table)

23:56.105 --> 23:58.938
I HAVEN'T CRIED YET.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.942
I'M USING WORK AND SEX
AS A DISTRACTION,

24:02.942 --> 24:06.516
AND I THINK
IT'S WORKING FOR ME.

24:06.516 --> 24:09.619
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE GIRL--AMANDA--

24:09.619 --> 24:12.482
SITTING OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL
ON THAT BENCH

24:12.482 --> 24:14.824
ALL DAY LONG, EVERY--
I MISS SEX.

24:14.824 --> 24:19.589
OH, I MISS IT SO MUCH.

24:22.031 --> 24:23.593
WHAT?

24:23.593 --> 24:26.596
MER, WH--
(door opens)

24:26.596 --> 24:29.769
I'M WORRIED ABOUT CLARA.
SHE'S DEPRESSED.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.971
BUT LIKE A WHOLE NEW LEVEL
OF DEPRESSED.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.674
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CEVICHE?

24:34.674 --> 24:36.075
THAT...

24:36.075 --> 24:38.147
(makes chopping sound)

24:38.147 --> 24:41.911
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S...
THAT IS SO RUDE. CEVICHE?

24:41.911 --> 24:43.913
THAT IS SO--THAT--IT--
THAT'S RUDE.

24:43.913 --> 24:46.886
THAT--THAT--
THAT IS SO RUDE.

24:49.218 --> 24:52.161
WELL, ANYONE ELSE
I CAN OFFEND?

24:52.161 --> 24:54.163
A TETHERED SPINAL CORD?

24:54.163 --> 24:57.196
MM-HMM. ONE OF THE THREADS
IN HIS SPINAL CORD

24:57.196 --> 24:59.028
IS ATTACHED TO HIS TAILBONE.

24:59.028 --> 25:01.170
NORMALLY THE SPINAL CORD
IS FREE AT THE END,

25:01.170 --> 25:05.535
BUT WITH IT ATTACHED, WHEN YOU
GREW, IT STARTED PULLING.
THUS THE EXCRUCIATING PAIN.

25:05.535 --> 25:08.007
SO CAN WE FIX IT?
IS IT FIXABLE?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.510
IT'S A MICROSURGERY.
I'LL SNIP THE TETHERED CORD,
AND HE'LL BE FREE OF PAIN.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.014
(cries)

25:15.014 --> 25:17.246
SHE'S NOT NORMALLY
LIKE THIS.
(sobs)

25:17.246 --> 25:19.689
BEFORE ALL THIS, SHE WAS,
LIKE, A NORMAL MOM.

25:19.689 --> 25:21.621
(sobs)
OH! (laughs)

25:21.621 --> 25:24.023
ANDY, THIS IS A NORMAL MOM.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.955
(Arizona chuckles)

25:29.929 --> 25:32.001
ARE WE WAITING
FOR DR. SWENDER?

25:32.001 --> 25:36.235
NO. DR. SWENDER HAS
HANDED YOU OFF TO ME.

25:36.235 --> 25:41.110
WH-WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE, SECOND YEAR?

25:41.110 --> 25:43.573
THIRD.

25:43.573 --> 25:46.075
THAT'S, UM...

25:46.075 --> 25:48.277
CAN WE PAGE DR. SWENDER
OR SOMETHING?

25:48.277 --> 25:50.279
STEVENS,
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

25:50.279 --> 25:52.221
IT IS.

25:52.221 --> 25:54.223
YOU STILL HAVE CANCER,

25:54.223 --> 25:57.787
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO INTEREST
DR. SWENDER ANYMORE.

25:57.787 --> 25:59.188
IT IS A GOOD THING.

25:59.188 --> 26:03.332
YOU'RE SAYING I HAVE
J.V. CANCER?

26:03.332 --> 26:06.565
I'M SAYING YOUR METS
HAVE SHRUNK WAY DOWN,

26:06.565 --> 26:08.768

26:08.768 --> 26:12.341
YOUR PROTOCOL IS WORKING
VERY EFFECTIVELY.

26:12.341 --> 26:13.673
STEVENS.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.946
THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD
AS THE NEWS GETS.

26:16.946 --> 26:20.279
UM... SO WHAT--
WHAT NOW?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.281
WE'RE GONNA USE
THE PORT IN YOUR CHEST

26:22.281 --> 26:24.614

YOUR I.L.-2 REGIMEN FOR NOW.

26:24.614 --> 26:28.017

26:28.017 --> 26:31.220

26:31.220 --> 26:34.293
IS THERE, UH, SOME KIND
OF TIMELINE ON THIS OR...

26:34.293 --> 26:37.266
YOUR WIFE IS LIVING
WITH CANCER, DR. KAREV.

26:37.266 --> 26:40.269
RIGHT NOW THE CANCER
HAS STOPPED GROWING.

26:40.269 --> 26:44.674
WITH A CANCER THIS AGGRESSIVE,
THAT'S PRETTY STUNNING SUCCESS.

26:44.674 --> 26:47.036
THERE'S NO TIMELINE.

26:47.036 --> 26:49.879
THERE'S JUST... WE WATCH IT.

26:49.879 --> 26:52.341
WE WAIT.

26:52.341 --> 26:54.844

TO GROW AGAIN.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.375
WHERE--WHERE--WHAT--

30:49.618 --> 30:52.952
GET UP.
I MEAN IT, GET UP.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.224
GET UP.

30:55.224 --> 30:57.086
(sighs)

30:57.086 --> 30:59.428
NOW GO GET A LIFE.

30:59.428 --> 31:01.130
(sighs)

31:01.130 --> 31:03.132
I CAN'T.

31:05.494 --> 31:07.897
GEORGE WAS A SURGEON.

31:07.897 --> 31:10.269
HE HAD A PURPOSE.
HE WANTED TO SAVE LIVES.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.372
AND NOW HE DOESN'T GET
THE CHANCE.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.375
NOW HE DOESN'T GET THE CHANCE
TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.607
BUT YOU DO.

31:18.607 --> 31:21.380
YOU COULD GO TO
MEDICAL SCHOOL, YOU KNOW?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.382
YOU COULD HANG OUT
WITH YOUR FREAKIN' FRIENDS.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.384
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.917
JUST GO DO SOMETHING
WITH YOUR LIFE,

31:27.917 --> 31:29.418
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE.

31:29.418 --> 31:32.221
YOU LIVED. YOU LIVED
AND GEORGE DIDN'T.

31:32.221 --> 31:35.394
AND I KNOW. I...

31:35.394 --> 31:38.327
I KNOW...

31:38.327 --> 31:42.471
THAT THAT FEELS HORRIBLE
AND SHOCKING...

31:42.471 --> 31:45.474
AND TERRIFYING.

31:45.474 --> 31:49.338
BUT YOU LIVED.

31:49.338 --> 31:53.182
SO GO LIVE
YOUR FREAKIN' LIFE.

31:55.444 --> 31:58.387
I... (voice breaks)
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

31:58.387 --> 32:00.649
NOBODY DOES.

32:00.649 --> 32:03.452
NOBODY KNOWS HOW.

32:03.452 --> 32:08.157
BUT GOD, HAVE ENOUGH RESPECT
FOR GEORGE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

32:08.157 --> 32:11.160
'CAUSE IF I SEE YOU SITTING
ON THIS BENCH EVER AGAIN,

32:11.160 --> 32:14.233
I WILL KICK YOUR ASS
FROM HERE TO SUNDAY.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.360
I CAN'T GET BACK
ON BAILEY'S SERVICE.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.163
I MEAN, SHE'S STILL NOT EVEN
LOOKING AT ME.
YOU JUST GOTTA GIVE IT TIME.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.366
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS CLOSE WITH
O'MALLEY, AND SHE'S WORKING--
YEAH, BUT THE THING IS,
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT O'MALLEY.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.598
I MEAN, SHE'S MAD AT ME
ABOUT CEVICHE.
(laughs) YOU GOTTA STOP THAT.

32:49.598 --> 32:52.401
CEVICHE?
OH, IT'S A--IT'S A PATIENT.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.443
A BOATING ACCIDENT VICTIM.

32:54.443 --> 32:57.306
SHE THINKS THAT IT'S OKAY
TO CALL HER A SEAFOOD DISH.

32:57.306 --> 33:00.109
IT'S A DELICIOUS
PERUVIAN DISH.
I MEAN, IS THAT--IS THAT OKAY?

33:00.109 --> 33:02.181
WELL, IT'S PRETTY DARK.
OH, COME ON. I'M DARK?

33:02.181 --> 33:05.184
I'M NOT THE ONE GOING AROUND
CHOKING PEOPLE IN THEIR SLEEP.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.186
WHAT? (laughs)
(laughs)

33:07.186 --> 33:10.159
(Cristina and Owen laugh)

33:10.159 --> 33:12.391

33:12.391 --> 33:14.293
TOO SOON?

33:21.030 --> 33:25.504
I'M NOT THE GUY GOING AROUND
CHOKING PEOPLE IN THEIR SLEEP.
I KNOW.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.476
IT WAS A DREAM. I...

33:27.476 --> 33:30.179
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT I WAS DREAMING ABOUT,

33:30.179 --> 33:34.383
BUT... I WAS TRYING
TO SAVE MY OWN LIFE.

33:36.345 --> 33:39.348
I WASN'T TRYING TO HURT YOU.

33:42.251 --> 33:45.054
I WAS...

33:45.054 --> 33:47.656
I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE.

33:53.362 --> 33:55.804
OKAY.

33:58.207 --> 34:00.209
(Wyatt)
YOU MADE A START.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.745
YOU MADE A START.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.351
(pants)

34:12.351 --> 34:14.353
(Lexie) YOU HAVE IT, CLARA.
YOU HAVE IT.

34:14.353 --> 34:17.426
YOU'VE GOT THIS.

34:17.426 --> 34:19.428
OH. OH!

34:19.428 --> 34:20.389
(laughs)

34:20.389 --> 34:22.331
YEAH, GIRL.
I DID IT.

34:22.331 --> 34:24.493
YOU DID IT.

34:24.493 --> 34:27.196
I DID IT.

34:27.196 --> 34:29.168
LEXIE.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.542
WILL YOU CALL MY MUM?

34:33.542 --> 34:35.073
YEAH.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.177
YEAH. (laughs)

34:38.177 --> 34:40.078
OKAY, COME ON.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.511
(sniffles) COME ON.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.113
GOOD.

34:44.113 --> 34:47.416
(laughs) YEAH.
YOU GOT IT.

34:47.416 --> 34:50.189
(Lexie) GRIEF MAY BE A THING
WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON...

34:50.189 --> 34:51.490
(laughs)

34:51.490 --> 34:53.492
BUT IT LOOKS DIFFERENT
ON EVERYONE.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.264
GREAT.

34:55.264 --> 34:57.666
(knock on door)

35:01.730 --> 35:03.472
HEY.

35:10.579 --> 35:13.542
(Mark) IT ISN'T JUST DEATH
WE HAVE TO GRIEVE.

35:13.542 --> 35:15.414
IT'S LIFE...

35:15.414 --> 35:17.186
IT'S LOSS...

35:17.186 --> 35:19.818
IT'S CHANGE.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.820
(Alex) AND WHEN WE WONDER

35:21.820 --> 35:25.154
WHY IT HAS TO SUCK
SO MUCH SOMETIMES,

35:25.154 --> 35:28.126
HAS TO HURT SO BAD...

35:28.126 --> 35:30.128
THE THING
WE GOTTA TRY TO REMEMBER

35:30.128 --> 35:33.131
IS THAT IT CAN TURN
ON A DIME...

35:33.131 --> 35:34.833
(closes door)

35:37.506 --> 35:39.738
WHAT IS THIS?
TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS.

35:39.738 --> 35:43.242
IZ, IT'S, UH...

35:43.242 --> 35:46.545
BE MY HUSBAND.

35:46.545 --> 35:50.179
GET UNDRESSED,
GET INTO BED AND HOLD ME.

35:50.179 --> 35:52.181
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SO MAD ABOUT

35:52.181 --> 35:54.683
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SCARED OF

35:54.683 --> 35:56.685
BECAUSE YOU WON'T TALK TO ME.

35:56.685 --> 35:59.688
BUT I'M SCARED, TOO, ALEX,
AND I-I CAN'T--IF YOU WON'T--

35:59.688 --> 36:02.761
IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANY CHANCE
AT A LIFE TOGETHER,

36:02.761 --> 36:06.595
THEN I NEED YOU TO...
PLEASE.

36:06.595 --> 36:09.638
YOU DIED IN MY ARMS.

36:09.638 --> 36:11.640
YOU DIED IN MY ARMS.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.643
YOU FREAKIN' DIED
AND THEN YOU LEFT INSTRUCTIONS

36:14.643 --> 36:17.576
THAT I WASN'T ALLOWED
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.908
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I'M SCARED OF?

36:19.908 --> 36:21.910
I'M SCARED OF EVERYTHING!

36:21.910 --> 36:23.912
I'M SCARED TO MOVE!
I'M SCARED TO BREATHE!

36:23.912 --> 36:26.955
I'M SCARED TO TOUCH YOU!

36:26.955 --> 36:30.459
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.
I WON'T SURVIVE.

36:30.459 --> 36:32.921
AND THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.924
YOU MADE ME LOVE YOU,
YOU MADE ME LET YOU IN,

36:35.924 --> 36:38.927
AND THEN YOU FREAKIN' DIE
IN MY ARMS!

36:41.600 --> 36:44.303
(Izzie)
THAT'S HOW YOU STAY ALIVE.

36:48.677 --> 36:52.511
WHEN IT HURTS SO MUCH
YOU CAN'T BREATHE,

36:52.511 --> 36:56.415

37:27.616 --> 37:29.478
