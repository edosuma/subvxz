WEBVTT

00:45.955 --> 00:47.721
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.237
Thorfinn!

01:07.876 --> 01:08.976
Inga!

01:17.419 --> 01:18.852
I know you're in here Inga.

01:21.357 --> 01:24.958
Got you!

01:29.999 --> 01:31.765
Now that was too easy.

01:38.540 --> 01:39.668
That might have been easy,

01:39.708 --> 01:43.339
but how're you
going to escape me?

01:43.379 --> 01:46.513
What if I don't
want to escape you?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.958
Aren't we meant to be
watching your brother?

02:02.998 --> 02:05.565
He can watch over himself.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.366
You shouldn't
sneak up on people.

02:41.103 --> 02:42.402
My, my, what's your
name little man?

02:46.408 --> 02:49.042
My name's Wolfstan, my
friends call me Wolf.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.907
It's Oskar, sir.

02:51.947 --> 02:56.011
Well Oskar, there's no
need to look so afraid,

02:56.051 --> 02:58.080
did you not enjoy my playing?

02:58.120 --> 03:01.955
No it's just we don't get
very many strangers here.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.126
I really could use
your help, young sir.

03:07.663 --> 03:11.431
You see I'm not a stranger,
I'm just somewhat lost.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.932
This is the Waldron
Settlement, yes?

03:16.972 --> 03:19.606
No, my village is
Grittleton Marsh.

03:20.876 --> 03:25.812
Ah, then I must've wandered
all the way over here.

03:31.854 --> 03:35.117
This is a map of the
whole Western lands,

03:35.157 --> 03:36.556
do you want to see?

03:37.693 --> 03:42.124
I bet that I could teach
a smart boy like you

03:42.164 --> 03:43.463
how to read it.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.066
Come, come and see.

03:50.472 --> 03:52.835
All of this is the
forest of Braegon,

03:52.875 --> 03:55.571
and here we are
on the outskirts,

03:55.611 --> 03:59.413
which must make this your
village of Grittleton Marsh.

04:03.051 --> 04:08.121
Tell me, have you ever dreamed
of becoming a great warrior?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.124
Of growing up tall and strong?

04:12.027 --> 04:15.424
I know I used to,
and now I know a way

04:15.464 --> 04:18.127
to make such a wish come true.

04:18.167 --> 04:20.162
We shouldn't be this
close to the forest.

04:20.202 --> 04:21.730
Well why not?

04:21.770 --> 04:23.165
It's dangerous alone.

04:23.205 --> 04:27.136
Oh, you really are very
smart for such a small,

04:27.176 --> 04:29.976
delicious thing, but
you see we're not alone.

04:31.113 --> 04:35.549
I always hunt with my pack.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.096
I think I heard something.

04:54.136 --> 04:55.836
It's nothing Thorfinn.

04:59.475 --> 05:02.004
Thorfinn?

05:02.044 --> 05:07.113
Oskar?

05:12.955 --> 05:14.187
Lord have mercy.

05:15.123 --> 05:18.024
Intruders, intruders, intruders!

05:26.535 --> 05:29.998
Lord Magnus, great hell-beasts
have come from the forest,

05:30.038 --> 05:31.500
we are under attack!

05:31.540 --> 05:33.707
You must hide my
lord, to safety!

05:43.252 --> 05:44.885
Feed my brothers.

06:07.209 --> 06:12.279
Inga, come on, hide.

06:13.148 --> 06:14.548
Inga, come on.

06:21.189 --> 06:22.556
Inga, hide.

06:23.292 --> 06:25.358
My family's out there.

06:38.206 --> 06:39.072
Stay back!

06:45.280 --> 06:46.146
Stay back.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.149
Stay back.

07:01.263 --> 07:06.333
No!

07:43.905 --> 07:45.038
Oskar, Oskar!

07:58.320 --> 07:59.419
Papa?

08:00.722 --> 08:01.454
Papa!

08:03.925 --> 08:05.821
Where is your brother?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.762
I don't know, I
don't know Papa.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.669
Go, run, go!

09:02.918 --> 09:04.346
The creatures have
moved on my lord,

09:04.386 --> 09:07.382
retreated to the
forest, we are safe.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.886
For now, but what of
our neighboring villages?

09:10.926 --> 09:12.754
This was a massacre.

09:12.794 --> 09:15.328
No doubt more will succumb
to the same brutality.

09:19.334 --> 09:23.999
Young Garstang, I am
sorry for your loss.

09:24.039 --> 09:25.371
You're lucky to be alive.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.336
We have no choice
but to send for help.

09:28.376 --> 09:30.305
There were three
great warrior knights,

09:30.345 --> 09:32.774
legendary across
the Western land.

09:32.814 --> 09:34.547
They will be our salvation,

09:35.884 --> 09:39.414
our only defense against the
demon-beasts from the forest.

11:44.379 --> 11:45.307
My lords.

11:45.347 --> 11:46.679
That won't be necessary.

11:49.117 --> 11:51.179
Baron Magnus.

11:51.219 --> 11:53.448
We are most relieved
you answered our summon.

11:53.488 --> 11:55.617
By my eye, a little too late.

11:55.657 --> 11:59.154
Your messenger made clear the
urgency of your predicament.

11:59.194 --> 12:00.426
We came immediately.

12:01.396 --> 12:04.993
This is Thomas, the huge.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.528
Aye.

12:06.568 --> 12:11.504
Osmund, our fastest rider,
myself, Hamelin Wiltshire.

12:12.574 --> 12:14.369
Your reputation
proceeds you, noble sir.

12:14.409 --> 12:18.144
And with us,
Hal Skullsplitter.

12:19.581 --> 12:21.509
I cannot do
business with a rogue.

12:21.549 --> 12:23.345
He is here to help, my lord.

12:23.385 --> 12:26.152
He is beyond redemption,
banished by the king.

12:28.089 --> 12:29.317
I think you need me more

12:29.357 --> 12:31.624
than I could give a damn
about the King's exile.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.662
Tell me what savagery
befell this land.

12:36.932 --> 12:38.927
My people were
slaughtered by an enemy

12:38.967 --> 12:44.037
that threatens us all:
wolves, greater than men.

12:45.373 --> 12:48.670
They attacked from the Braegon
Forest like a dark army,

12:48.710 --> 12:52.545
unstoppable, ravenous for blood.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.860
Greater than men?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.113
You mean men my size
or men his size?

13:08.697 --> 13:11.698
Ah, looks more like
your wife's size, Thomas.

13:18.606 --> 13:21.102
Do not underestimate
these monsters.

13:21.142 --> 13:23.705
They are unlike any beast
I've ever laid eyes on.

13:23.745 --> 13:25.674
What is to be our quest?

13:25.714 --> 13:27.642
Inform King Vortigern
of our plight.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.979
You must venture to his castle,
through their territory,

13:31.019 --> 13:32.647
the territory of beasts.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.253
Vortigern's a cruel king,

13:35.256 --> 13:37.285
he cares little for his people.

13:37.325 --> 13:39.554
Settlements starve and
waste away across the land,

13:39.594 --> 13:40.588
and what help does he offer?

13:40.628 --> 13:42.290
A war with devil creatures

13:42.330 --> 13:44.326
is an entirely different crisis.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.694
The king would not turn down

13:45.734 --> 13:48.296
an opportunity for
battle, bloodshed.

13:48.336 --> 13:51.466
Aye, he would not.

13:51.506 --> 13:53.768
How long until every
village is ravished

13:53.808 --> 13:56.705
and they fixed their bloodthirsty
eyes on Castle Braegon?

13:56.745 --> 13:59.307
Then the king himself
will fall into danger.

13:59.347 --> 14:01.714
You must plead with
him to take action.

14:03.084 --> 14:07.053
Take our map, you will need
it to navigate a safe trail.

14:10.358 --> 14:14.093
The forest is perilous,
many do not return.

14:14.763 --> 14:16.596
I can lead them to the castle.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.063
I've been before with
my father, Grimbold,

14:22.103 --> 14:24.332
he made this journey carrying
messages to Vortigern.

14:24.372 --> 14:28.103
Please pardon the boy, he
has suffered a severe loss.

14:28.143 --> 14:29.204
I could be your navigator.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.576
We travel alone.

14:31.679 --> 14:34.509
I will not be distracted
tending after some village boy.

14:34.549 --> 14:35.343
He will remain here.

14:35.383 --> 14:36.511
But I want to help!

14:36.551 --> 14:38.084
Silence Thorfinn!

14:39.821 --> 14:41.854
Do not interfere.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.655
- I say the lad comes.
- No.

14:47.695 --> 14:50.825
We do not know what
dangers lurk in that forest.

14:50.865 --> 14:53.766
It's not a place we'd wish
to find ourselves lost in.

14:54.803 --> 14:58.199
The land is vast,
almost two days journey,

14:58.239 --> 15:00.368
and now inhabited by beasts.

15:00.408 --> 15:03.138
Aye, I say he comes.

15:03.178 --> 15:05.774
Whether he can fight or not,
he'll be a useful guide.

15:05.814 --> 15:08.143
When the wolf-men come for us,

15:08.183 --> 15:10.245
I will not be
responsible for his fate.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.446
Oh don't you worry,

15:11.486 --> 15:13.419
we all know you're a
heartless bastard, Hal.

15:14.756 --> 15:17.123
It's his own risk to take.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.094
What say you
Thorfinn Garstang?

15:22.430 --> 15:24.597
You wish to put yourself
in mortal danger?

15:28.736 --> 15:29.836
I'll go.

15:50.592 --> 15:53.721
Hamelin, you think
it wise to bring

15:53.761 --> 15:55.523
this village boy on our quest?

15:55.563 --> 15:58.326
We do not know
Braegon Forest, Hal.

15:58.366 --> 15:59.861
He will be useful.

15:59.901 --> 16:01.896
If we run into trouble,
he will be the first to die.

16:01.936 --> 16:03.398
That blood will
be on your hands.

16:03.438 --> 16:05.638
As will your blood if we fail.

16:06.741 --> 16:08.870
I've known many knights
enter Braegon Forest

16:08.910 --> 16:10.905
only to lose their minds,

16:10.945 --> 16:13.541
return as withered,
delusional wrecks,

16:13.581 --> 16:17.917
rambling of mystical monsters
and tentacled mutations.

16:19.854 --> 16:24.924
We are all strong, fearless,
and have defeated many men,

16:26.227 --> 16:29.591
but these are beasts,
Hal, unlike any other foe

16:29.631 --> 16:31.531
we've ever been
tasked to battle.

16:32.901 --> 16:35.797
All the help we can get to
ensure we reach Castle Braegon

16:35.837 --> 16:38.204
we would be wise to accept.

16:54.789 --> 16:56.784
I hope you know what
you're doing Young Garstang.

16:56.824 --> 16:58.219
I want to go with them.

16:58.259 --> 17:00.359
Then we must assume
you may not return.

17:02.430 --> 17:06.499
You're not like them
Thorfinn, you're no warrior,

17:07.869 --> 17:10.431
you'll be no match for
whatever evil awaits.

17:10.471 --> 17:12.004
And of what use was I here?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.670
When my family and
village needed protection,

17:15.710 --> 17:17.572
what good was I against
those beasts then?

17:17.612 --> 17:19.274
That is precisely my point-

17:19.314 --> 17:21.976
- Now there is some small
way I can be of service.

17:22.016 --> 17:24.913
It doesn't matter if I make
it home, there is no home now.

17:24.953 --> 17:26.919
- Thorfinn-
- I've nothing left here!

17:31.593 --> 17:32.925
Nothing to return to.

17:35.296 --> 17:38.631
No family, no honor.

17:43.538 --> 17:44.837
You have spirit, boy.

17:46.407 --> 17:49.204
If your heart cannot be
discouraged then I wish you well.

17:49.244 --> 17:51.773
Go with them, but
do not trust the man

17:51.813 --> 17:54.814
they call Skullsplitter,
he is not a knight.

17:57.919 --> 18:02.888
This was your father's ax,
strong, with a silver blade.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.988
I'm sure he'd be
proud of your bravery,

18:07.028 --> 18:08.728
however misguided it may be.

18:13.001 --> 18:15.268
Give yourself a fighting
chance at least.

18:40.295 --> 18:42.862
Oh no, that's not him, is it?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.465
Watch you don't step
on the little fella.

18:49.771 --> 18:54.307
He is to be our
navigator, Percy, be nice.

18:57.111 --> 18:58.844
He's got some fucking balls.

18:59.981 --> 19:01.476
He can do a
share of your duties.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.316
Too
bloody right he can.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.450
Fancy yourself some
sort of hero then?

19:09.490 --> 19:10.656
Just trying to help.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.022
Begin by carrying that.

19:14.062 --> 19:15.761
Hal, give it a rest.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.561
When the wolves are picking
the meat from your bones

19:20.601 --> 19:23.002
and you're screaming
for help and mercy,

19:24.105 --> 19:25.500
you don't think
this fool's courage

19:25.540 --> 19:27.673
might be something you
might come to regret?

19:34.782 --> 19:37.045
It is not too late to turn back.

19:37.085 --> 19:40.519
I've chosen this path
sir, I'm not turning back.

19:43.057 --> 19:46.058
Then just know,
when the time comes,

19:47.428 --> 19:49.657
I will not risk mine nor
my fellow knight's lives

19:49.697 --> 19:51.097
coming to your rescue.

19:53.634 --> 19:54.862
I can fend for myself.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.031
Ah, did you hear that, Hal?

19:57.071 --> 19:58.599
He can fend for himself.

19:58.639 --> 19:59.905
That I doubt.

20:02.443 --> 20:05.478
Come on son, come on.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.614
Don't let them get to you, eh?

20:58.699 --> 20:59.660
This is where we enter.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.129
This way.

21:01.169 --> 21:03.097
It's a quicker route
approaching from the east.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.099
The path from
the east is longer.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.068
Entering here will lead
us straight to the castle,

21:07.108 --> 21:09.208
save us half a
day, perhaps more.

21:10.711 --> 21:15.143
No, look, there's
a river to cross,

21:15.183 --> 21:18.946
the ground is uneven, we would
have to climb here and here.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.947
This way is safer.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.850
There's a crossing point,
and we can take refuge

21:22.890 --> 21:24.757
at the woodland
village of Chalamet.

21:30.965 --> 21:32.827
The boy's right Hal.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.634
We make our trail to
the east, onwards!

23:04.759 --> 23:05.658
Hamelin?

23:08.262 --> 23:09.361
Look.

23:10.865 --> 23:11.764
A warning.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.334
This is their territory.

23:34.288 --> 23:37.356
You're gonna see worse
than this, village boy.

23:39.193 --> 23:41.322
Come on lad,
it'll be all right.

23:41.362 --> 23:42.328
I'm fine, I'm fine.

23:47.234 --> 23:51.704
Let's move on before sun
down, find a place to settle

23:55.910 --> 23:57.142
far away from here.

24:38.753 --> 24:41.248
Hey Thorfinn, were
these wolves really as big

24:41.288 --> 24:42.655
as the Baron claims?

24:43.758 --> 24:45.786
Nobody stood a chance.

24:45.826 --> 24:47.226
Lost loved ones, did you?

24:49.330 --> 24:51.930
My parents, my
brother, my girl.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.770
I could have saved her.

24:58.472 --> 25:01.073
Some battles cannot be won.

25:02.476 --> 25:04.143
Don't torment yourself.

25:06.280 --> 25:10.411
Oi Thorfinn, have this.

25:10.451 --> 25:11.417
Lost me appetite.

25:12.953 --> 25:14.987
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, have it.

25:16.123 --> 25:19.992
Best part of the fish is
that, keeps you strong.

25:21.929 --> 25:23.996
Well I wouldn't eat
those fish gonads.

25:29.470 --> 25:31.699
I mean I'm not
lying, it's good for you.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.205
It's just I wouldn't eat it.

25:36.343 --> 25:39.445
You know as a boy my village
told tales of wolf-men.

25:40.948 --> 25:45.884
If a man was bad, did
sinful things like murder,

25:47.254 --> 25:49.950
eat the flesh of other men,
if a man behaved like a beast,

25:49.990 --> 25:52.319
then the gods would
turn him into one.

25:52.359 --> 25:56.829
That's how men first became
wolves: a punishment.

25:58.199 --> 26:00.294
Now some said that they'd
have to serve their time

26:00.334 --> 26:05.166
for seven years, seven
long years as a beast

26:05.206 --> 26:07.435
in order to redeem themselves,

26:07.475 --> 26:10.104
and only then might
the gods allow them

26:10.144 --> 26:12.010
to return to their human form.

26:13.514 --> 26:16.148
Wolves are wolves,
they cannot change.

26:17.818 --> 26:20.181
All they know is
killing and eating.

26:20.221 --> 26:21.148
Eating?

26:21.188 --> 26:22.383
A bit like you then Thomas.

26:22.423 --> 26:26.425
Oh you cheeky shit.

26:29.530 --> 26:33.360
The worst plague that
could ever befall a man,

26:33.400 --> 26:35.930
the plague of lycanthropy,

26:35.970 --> 26:38.937
a curse that none
would wish to carry.

26:40.274 --> 26:44.777
Better to die a man than
to live as half-beast.

27:07.968 --> 27:10.235
Why is Hal so
against me being here?

27:11.872 --> 27:13.267
I wouldn't worry about it lad.

27:13.307 --> 27:16.608
It's not you, he just
doesn't trust anyone is all.

27:17.545 --> 27:19.173
You know he's an
outlaw don't you?

27:19.213 --> 27:21.146
The king wants him dead,

27:22.483 --> 27:26.413
but no one's brave enough or
stupid enough to challenge him.

27:26.453 --> 27:28.249
Why?

27:28.289 --> 27:29.188
What did he do?

27:33.460 --> 27:35.289
Out of us knights,

27:35.329 --> 27:37.629
he has definitely won
the most victories,

27:39.300 --> 27:42.201
but he's also suffered
the greatest loss.

27:45.072 --> 27:48.407
And it's that hatred that
gives him his unbeatable fury.

27:49.476 --> 27:53.312
The problem is, it's a
vengeance that he can't control.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.610
The people that did
him wrong, well,

27:56.650 --> 27:58.283
they didn't meet a nice end.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.987
You see there's overreacting

28:03.023 --> 28:07.588
and then there's
the blood hurricane

28:07.628 --> 28:08.961
that is Hal Skullsplitter.

28:11.665 --> 28:13.632
Just be grateful
he's on our side.

29:10.090 --> 29:12.257
I hope you
weren't dreaming about me.

29:35.416 --> 29:39.685
Nights are the hardest, bad
memories return at their worst.

29:42.589 --> 29:45.123
But at least in dreams you
can be with them again,

29:46.560 --> 29:47.492
the ones you lost.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.564
The other knights they talk
of courage and bravery,

29:53.701 --> 29:56.101
but I say all you need
is pure pissed off fury.

29:57.471 --> 30:00.272
Everyone feared the army that
took my brother, marauders,

30:02.643 --> 30:04.476
nobody would stand against them.

30:05.713 --> 30:07.241
But with my sword in my hand,

30:07.281 --> 30:09.443
I dare say I enjoyed
the relief it brought me

30:09.483 --> 30:11.350
to cut their heads
from their necks.

30:12.987 --> 30:14.481
No, I couldn't have
stopped that bloodshed

30:14.521 --> 30:15.721
even if I'd wanted to.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.018
But I've come to realize

30:19.058 --> 30:21.425
that no matter what foul hand
we're dealt, life does go on.

30:23.630 --> 30:26.327
Today you wonder if there's
any point in living,

30:26.367 --> 30:29.468
but two years from now
you'll be a new man.

30:31.005 --> 30:33.667
Where once you were cowardly
now you can be brave,

30:33.707 --> 30:36.041
and where once people
took you for a fool,

30:38.112 --> 30:39.778
new people might
know you as a hero.

30:41.749 --> 30:45.117
There's no more precious
gift than life, Thorfinn.

30:46.754 --> 30:48.720
That's why we fight.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.160
- Hal?
- Stay here.

30:57.765 --> 30:58.730
Pick up your ax.

31:11.812 --> 31:13.707
Thomas, Thomas wake up!

31:13.747 --> 31:16.681
Not tonight Greta,
I'm shattered.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.077
Why good evening handsome.

31:45.879 --> 31:47.775
Didn't wake you, did I?

31:47.815 --> 31:49.510
You're no human.

31:49.550 --> 31:54.519
No, no that's a curse that
no longer burdens me, friend.

31:55.556 --> 31:59.091
Now I'm something more evolved.

32:00.094 --> 32:03.395
Liberated from the
decrepitude of man.

32:04.832 --> 32:07.294
I'm in no mood for
your bather, demon-breed.

32:07.334 --> 32:11.365
But I'd
wager my bad mood

32:11.405 --> 32:13.638
is far worse than
yours.

32:16.343 --> 32:19.740
Wise to leave while you
still can, you scrawny fuck.

32:19.780 --> 32:20.679
Wise?

32:21.849 --> 32:24.378
Always the strong and
the brave come to see

32:24.418 --> 32:28.315
what threatens their pack,
leaves behind the wise,

32:28.355 --> 32:31.923
open and vulnerable
to my attack.

32:33.193 --> 32:33.925
Yum, yum.

32:36.897 --> 32:42.134
Fuck!

33:07.828 --> 33:10.795
Move Percy, find
a place to hide!

33:40.594 --> 33:41.960
Run Thorfinn.

33:50.237 --> 33:50.969
Osmund!

34:28.609 --> 34:30.842
Get off him you bastard.

34:36.383 --> 34:37.349
Osmund, no.

34:38.986 --> 34:40.252
Osmund?

34:41.421 --> 34:42.320
Fuck!

35:15.856 --> 35:16.755
No, no!

35:23.697 --> 35:25.297
No!

36:59.159 --> 37:02.127
Oh please!

37:04.030 --> 37:05.530
Oh God, please, please!

37:09.636 --> 37:11.469
Please, please, stop!

37:13.073 --> 37:14.172
Please, please.

37:16.042 --> 37:19.072
Is this how you
want to die Percy?

37:19.112 --> 37:20.907
Death in the service
of these knights

37:20.947 --> 37:22.747
who won't even come
to your rescue?

37:24.918 --> 37:26.217
Don't listen to him Percy.

37:27.721 --> 37:32.119
You're not one of them!

37:32.159 --> 37:34.025
And you never will be.

37:36.096 --> 37:40.031
There is no need to suffer
the pain of mankind,

37:41.067 --> 37:45.170
you can live like
us, Percy, free.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.736
Let primal instinct
run through you,

37:49.776 --> 37:54.012
let the limitations
of mankind slip away.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.815
Don't believe a
word he says, Percy.

37:58.118 --> 38:01.782
Are you gonna fight
and die like a man,

38:01.822 --> 38:05.223
or live like a beast?

38:06.092 --> 38:09.227
Supreme, undefeatable.

38:11.164 --> 38:16.234
No Percy, don't!

38:19.639 --> 38:20.939
How would I join you?

38:22.108 --> 38:25.105
I don't want to die.

38:25.145 --> 38:30.215
Just ask, my darling, and
I can make you one of us.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.252
Percy, don't!

38:38.859 --> 38:39.757
Let me live.

38:42.729 --> 38:45.725
Gladly.

40:13.753 --> 40:15.820
You'll live.

40:21.361 --> 40:23.361
We must reach Castle
Braegon by dark,

40:26.066 --> 40:28.161
won't survive another
night out here.

40:28.201 --> 40:30.230
What about Thomas and Percy?

40:30.270 --> 40:31.202
What about them?

40:32.038 --> 40:33.415
They're gone.

40:33.455 --> 40:34.834
They dragged Thomas
screaming, he's not dead yet.

40:34.874 --> 40:36.736
He will be by now.

40:36.776 --> 40:39.372
They're not taking him
for some merry dance.

40:39.412 --> 40:42.108
There's nothing that we
can do for them Thorfinn,

40:42.148 --> 40:43.243
they're gone.

40:43.283 --> 40:44.311
Perhaps if we'd
stayed with Thomas

40:44.351 --> 40:45.579
instead of coming after you-

40:45.619 --> 40:46.346
- Hal.
- He'd have lived.

40:46.386 --> 40:47.314
Enough!

40:47.354 --> 40:48.281
I could have fought them off-

40:48.321 --> 40:50.317
- We cannot blame the boy!

40:50.357 --> 40:52.285
He warned us what
this would be like,

40:52.325 --> 40:56.122
none of us could have known the
strength of those creatures!

40:56.162 --> 40:58.792
Now we must hurry to the castle,

40:58.832 --> 41:01.795
we do not have time to
mount a rescue mission

41:01.835 --> 41:04.636
for somebody who is
most likely long dead.

41:06.239 --> 41:08.806
We told you this would
not be an easy quest.

41:10.110 --> 41:13.206
Now, go to the river
and clean yourself up.

41:13.246 --> 41:16.681
We can't help you reeking of
blood, they'll sniff us out.

41:25.692 --> 41:28.321
Don't feel the
need to wait for me.

41:28.361 --> 41:29.994
It was a mistake for me to come.

41:40.907 --> 41:43.975
He defended himself
against that wolf, Hal.

41:45.078 --> 41:46.477
The boy did well.

41:50.316 --> 41:51.382
Not well enough.

42:20.814 --> 42:21.713
Hello?

42:27.821 --> 42:32.890
Hey!

42:54.781 --> 42:56.710
Get off of me!

42:56.750 --> 42:57.448
Thomas!

44:08.955 --> 44:13.291
It's me.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.907
When they come for
me, run that way.

44:30.910 --> 44:32.176
No, no, don't, don't.

45:02.075 --> 45:03.641
I want that flesh.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.242
- What's this?
- Back off!

45:42.282 --> 45:45.378
You think you're one of
them now, some warrior?

45:45.418 --> 45:46.613
Stay back!

45:46.653 --> 45:48.948
We aren't built
like knights, are we?

45:48.988 --> 45:51.584
You'll always rely on them
to fight your battles for you

45:51.624 --> 45:54.458
because you're too
small, too weak.

45:55.728 --> 45:57.190
But what if I was to tell you

45:57.230 --> 45:58.925
that there was a way
that you could become

45:58.965 --> 46:01.332
even stronger than any knight?

46:02.435 --> 46:06.671
Mighty, powerful,
and dominating.

46:07.974 --> 46:10.536
I will never be
like you, beast!

46:21.387 --> 46:22.286
Thomas!

46:27.393 --> 46:28.292
Come on.

46:29.729 --> 46:33.927
Oh Thorfinn, you madman,
you total fucking madman!

46:55.722 --> 46:56.754
Thomas!

47:00.193 --> 47:01.325
Easy, easy, easy, ah!

47:06.699 --> 47:08.199
Where did you find him?

47:09.002 --> 47:11.731
The boy came to my rescue Hal,

47:11.771 --> 47:13.366
gave them feral dogs
quite the fright.

47:13.406 --> 47:14.472
Did you see Percy?

47:15.675 --> 47:17.375
They made him
one of their own.

47:22.749 --> 47:24.344
How many were there?

47:24.384 --> 47:26.817
Thorfinn killed one,
they'll have fled by now.

47:31.791 --> 47:33.190
This changes nothing.

47:34.527 --> 47:36.656
We must go on without
you Thomas, I'm sorry.

47:36.696 --> 47:38.157
No!

47:38.197 --> 47:40.159
He's wounded, slow, weak,
he's in no state to fight.

47:40.199 --> 47:41.761
We can't leave him behind.

47:41.801 --> 47:43.696
Use your head
fucking head, Thorfinn!

47:43.736 --> 47:45.064
He's dying!

47:45.104 --> 47:46.666
All you've done is
prolonged his suffering

47:46.706 --> 47:48.501
and burdened the rest of us.

47:48.541 --> 47:51.042
Well thank you very
fucking much, Hal.

47:53.846 --> 47:56.209
We won't survive
another night out here,

47:56.249 --> 47:57.643
the wolves will
come to finish us

47:57.683 --> 47:59.679
when we are most vulnerable
and we will all die.

47:59.719 --> 48:01.080
I'll take care of him, then.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.615
He's twice your
size, Thorfinn!

48:02.655 --> 48:05.118
This boy has a death
wish, he's lost hope!

48:05.158 --> 48:08.359
He has dignity
Hal, and humanity!

48:09.462 --> 48:11.624
Leaving a man behind
is what they would do

48:11.664 --> 48:13.764
because they are savages.

48:15.334 --> 48:17.764
We'll take him as far
as this next village,

48:17.804 --> 48:19.665
but he cannot make the
full journey with us.

48:19.705 --> 48:23.607
Fine, we'll seek shelter
for him there, okay Thorfinn?

48:31.451 --> 48:34.247
Where was this courage
when your village fell?

48:34.287 --> 48:35.186
Answer me that.

48:37.390 --> 48:38.856
You want to talk like a knight,

48:40.359 --> 48:41.320
better learn to
dress like a knight

48:41.360 --> 48:43.194
and defend yourself, properly.

48:44.630 --> 48:47.098
Put that on, come on.

48:55.408 --> 48:57.808
His blade will not be
as effective as your ax,

48:58.611 --> 48:59.510
it's steel.

49:01.781 --> 49:06.851
This blade is silver,
powerful against the wolf-men.

49:11.190 --> 49:14.353
What, you thought you had a
better attack than Hamelin's?

49:14.393 --> 49:16.789
It was merely a
better instrument.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.596
Next time you won't be so lucky.

49:19.832 --> 49:21.599
Which
way to the village?

49:22.835 --> 49:23.901
Follow me.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.143
What
dismal place is this

50:10.183 --> 50:12.545
you've brought us to, Thorfinn?

50:12.585 --> 50:14.180
Everything has changed.

50:14.220 --> 50:17.884
You mean it wasn't
always this uninviting?

50:17.924 --> 50:20.558
- Hal?
- Hello there.

50:23.963 --> 50:24.962
We come peacefully.

50:28.768 --> 50:31.364
We are knights on our
way to Castle Braegon,

50:31.404 --> 50:34.004
one of my men here is
injured, he seeks refuge.

50:35.408 --> 50:36.636
Who followed you?

50:36.676 --> 50:38.509
No one, we come alone.

50:39.912 --> 50:41.723
You sure of that, are you?

50:41.763 --> 50:43.576
Bringing that half devoured
wolf's dinner into my village,

50:43.616 --> 50:44.949
you're inviting trouble!

50:46.986 --> 50:50.921
I'm sorry knight, we do
not welcome outsiders.

50:52.291 --> 50:53.986
We've seen enough devastation.

50:54.026 --> 50:54.858
Really?

50:55.995 --> 50:57.490
I hadn't noticed.

50:57.530 --> 51:00.231
That one looks at the
end of his rope, Griff.

51:00.866 --> 51:01.861
Let's give him shelter, eh?

51:01.901 --> 51:03.829
They're warriors Maggie.

51:03.869 --> 51:07.633
He's wounded though,
they all look desperate.

51:07.673 --> 51:08.606
I'll take him in.

51:13.479 --> 51:17.009
My wife's a healer, she'll
see to your wounded friend.

51:17.049 --> 51:18.315
Thank you lady.

51:21.554 --> 51:22.953
- You're a blacksmith.
- Aye.

51:29.996 --> 51:31.190
Don't touch that!

51:31.230 --> 51:32.463
That's our only defense
against the monsters.

51:33.733 --> 51:37.430
No, we're your only
defense against the monsters.

51:37.470 --> 51:38.998
Put it back!

51:39.038 --> 51:40.600
It's the only thing what
keeps them from entering.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.435
Hal, it's their
only protection.

51:42.475 --> 51:46.777
I don't care, I aim to
kill the fucking things,

51:48.581 --> 51:50.876
we need all the
silver we can get.

51:50.916 --> 51:54.947
I said, put it back.

51:54.987 --> 51:57.483
Listen to me
carefully blacksmith,

51:57.523 --> 52:00.453
these wolves have already spread
as far as Grittleton Marsh,

52:00.493 --> 52:03.389
his entire village has fallen
and many more will follow.

52:03.429 --> 52:04.957
Now, unless you want to be

52:04.997 --> 52:07.927
the only mortal villagers
left alive in this kingdom,

52:07.967 --> 52:09.633
you'll do as we ask and help.

52:11.570 --> 52:13.933
Can you melt the silver or not?

52:13.973 --> 52:15.968
Aye.

52:16.008 --> 52:18.471
Hamelin, give me your sword.

52:18.511 --> 52:20.306
If the blacksmith can give
our weapons a coat of silver,

52:20.346 --> 52:21.679
we stand a better chance.

52:24.317 --> 52:26.350
Come on Thomas,
let's get you inside.

52:27.687 --> 52:30.354
Thorfinn, find
whatever silver you can.

52:36.962 --> 52:39.029
Best follow me to the forge.

52:42.368 --> 52:45.569
Come along.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.952
Sit him down.

53:02.988 --> 53:05.389
Here, a chair.

53:15.434 --> 53:16.761
He's a big bugger.

53:16.801 --> 53:18.130
Needs food in his
belly is what he needs.

53:18.170 --> 53:19.803
I know what'll do the trick.

53:22.608 --> 53:25.843
I have remedies, things what
I've foraged in the woods.

53:27.179 --> 53:30.409
All strange plants and
flowers grow around here.

53:30.449 --> 53:32.511
We don't want your magic,

53:32.551 --> 53:34.980
we don't believe in
your village tales.

53:35.020 --> 53:37.016
Thomas, let her help.

53:37.056 --> 53:39.018
Just let us rest.

53:58.911 --> 54:00.911
Here on the table, go on!

54:10.156 --> 54:12.017
What happened here?

54:12.057 --> 54:16.856
Travelers, skinny things they
were, malnourished and all.

54:16.896 --> 54:19.458
We thought the king had
raided their settlement.

54:19.498 --> 54:22.433
We've heard the stories,
took pity on them,

54:23.702 --> 54:24.735
gave them shelter.

54:26.138 --> 54:28.105
But as night fell
they were men no more,

54:29.175 --> 54:31.708
killed every bloody
thing in sight.

54:33.045 --> 54:35.012
I hid the women and
children as best I could.

54:36.115 --> 54:38.115
Other men weren't so brave.

54:39.084 --> 54:41.018
Most of them joined
the bastard wolves.

54:42.221 --> 54:45.433
I'm sorry.

54:45.473 --> 54:48.724
Stayed for many days,
feasting on all who were left.

54:55.501 --> 54:57.129
We became their livestock,

54:57.169 --> 55:00.804
as they ate and
butchered all they could.

55:05.244 --> 55:06.777
Why'd they leave you?

55:09.915 --> 55:11.782
Lucky, I guess.

55:13.252 --> 55:14.184
They moved on.

55:15.788 --> 55:17.254
To the other settlements?

55:18.057 --> 55:18.922
Aye.

55:24.196 --> 55:26.497
There's more silver
hanging in the woods,

55:27.533 --> 55:29.500
enough for all
three blades, easy.

55:31.270 --> 55:32.102
Go on.

55:46.285 --> 55:51.221
Here you are boys,
fill your guts.

55:59.765 --> 56:01.164
Oh that's good.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.546
Got a bit of a
tickle in me throat.

56:20.586 --> 56:22.214
Don't eat it Hamelin.

56:22.254 --> 56:24.116
What's in this, exactly?

56:24.156 --> 56:25.885
We're never safe here.

56:25.925 --> 56:28.220
Some nights they
come back for food.

56:28.260 --> 56:31.524
If we don't give them
any, then they eat us.

56:31.564 --> 56:34.598
All we have to survive
is their leftovers.

56:35.634 --> 56:40.704
Leftovers ,
leftovers from what?

56:51.617 --> 56:53.784
They see this place
as a feeding ground.

56:54.787 --> 56:56.215
You witch!

56:56.255 --> 57:00.052
The wolf's bane will
drive them out, weaken them.

57:00.092 --> 57:03.055
You eat the queen of
poisons, they eat you.

57:26.785 --> 57:28.685
Griff says we had to
feed them something!

57:30.022 --> 57:32.651
We should have joined them,
instead of torturing ourselves.

57:32.691 --> 57:35.921
At least that way the gods
would excuse what we've done.

57:55.147 --> 57:56.113
One down.

58:24.910 --> 58:26.443
Hal!

58:58.444 --> 59:00.210
Hamelin!

59:01.013 --> 59:03.275
Hamelin, Hamelin, no!

59:03.315 --> 59:05.144
- No!
- Thomas!

59:07.419 --> 59:09.419
- Thomas.
- Thorfinn, run!

59:12.157 --> 59:13.890
Thomas.

1:01:24.957 --> 1:01:26.523
Run Thorfinn, run!

1:02:49.341 --> 1:02:54.411
Come on!

1:03:06.959 --> 1:03:08.091
I'll be fine.

1:03:52.337 --> 1:03:54.666
You run Thorfinn,
get to the castle!

1:03:54.706 --> 1:03:56.401
I'll hold them off.

1:03:56.441 --> 1:03:57.707
- No, no!
- Go!

1:03:58.744 --> 1:04:00.305
You know the way, I don't.

1:04:00.345 --> 1:04:02.207
If you die then it's all over!

1:04:02.247 --> 1:04:03.675
- I'll buy you time.
- Hal, please-

1:04:03.715 --> 1:04:05.377
- Takes the sword.

1:04:05.417 --> 1:04:06.311
I can't do this without you-

1:04:06.351 --> 1:04:07.717
- Take the fucking sword!

1:04:09.521 --> 1:04:11.116
Find the king.

1:04:11.156 --> 1:04:12.522
You can still save us.

1:04:13.592 --> 1:04:14.491
Go!

1:04:24.836 --> 1:04:26.536
Come on then you bastards.

1:04:39.451 --> 1:04:40.784
Hal Balfager.

1:04:43.688 --> 1:04:45.088
Hal the brave.

1:04:47.092 --> 1:04:50.827
What Vortigern wouldn't
give to see you again.

1:06:28.793 --> 1:06:32.457
No, no.

1:06:41.206 --> 1:06:43.907
I can't, I can't do this alone.

1:06:54.419 --> 1:06:55.318
Hal!

1:06:56.988 --> 1:06:59.551
Thomas!

1:06:59.591 --> 1:07:04.594
Help me, please, please.

1:11:11.509 --> 1:11:16.579
Thorfinn, Thorfinn, up
here gorgeous.

1:11:21.119 --> 1:11:23.686
The king is expecting you.

1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:31.894
Don't want to keep him waiting.

1:12:47.605 --> 1:12:52.675
So this is the young
tenderfoot from the marshlands,

1:12:54.612 --> 1:12:56.212
come to beg my mercy.

1:12:57.282 --> 1:12:59.177
Hal said you'd find me.

1:12:59.217 --> 1:13:01.312
Hal, he's here?

1:13:01.352 --> 1:13:05.984
My warlord brought
him to me, to kill.

1:13:06.024 --> 1:13:09.587
Hal still had some
hope in his eyes then

1:13:09.627 --> 1:13:12.790
that you'd change me somehow.

1:13:12.830 --> 1:13:17.900
I want to see that hope fade
to darkness before he dies.

1:13:18.970 --> 1:13:22.667
I want him to see
that you have failed.

1:13:22.707 --> 1:13:24.035
We came to you for help!

1:13:24.075 --> 1:13:28.239
Help, from what?

1:13:28.279 --> 1:13:31.981
They are my children,
they are my army.

1:13:33.284 --> 1:13:35.880
The kingdom was suffering,

1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:39.822
the people were a weak
and desperate breed.

1:13:41.593 --> 1:13:44.122
Now look what they have become.

1:13:44.162 --> 1:13:46.558
What about our humanity?

1:13:46.598 --> 1:13:48.960
What about those who
wouldn't sink so low

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.866
as to feed on the
flesh of other men?

1:13:53.338 --> 1:13:55.716
Men are gone!

1:13:55.756 --> 1:13:58.173
The rest of us will become
my one sublime species.

1:14:01.312 --> 1:14:06.382
Vortigern, I have
seen my village fall,

1:14:07.151 --> 1:14:09.318
my family destroyed.

1:14:11.623 --> 1:14:14.586
I've braved Braegon Forest,

1:14:14.626 --> 1:14:18.089
watched my friends meet
their deaths fighting,

1:14:18.129 --> 1:14:21.664
all for me to be here
with you right now.

1:14:25.770 --> 1:14:29.405
I beg you my king, bring
an end to this evil.

1:14:34.445 --> 1:14:37.413
You're somehow
brave, tenderfoot.

1:14:39.083 --> 1:14:41.717
But evidently a fool.

1:14:43.287 --> 1:14:47.123
Better to die a man then
to live as half-beast.

1:14:51.963 --> 1:14:53.996
Then die you will.

1:15:15.386 --> 1:15:16.381
Thorfinn?

1:15:16.421 --> 1:15:17.687
No.

1:15:23.027 --> 1:15:24.326
No, let him go!

1:15:42.413 --> 1:15:47.483
Harry, Harry, my only
living son finally returned.

1:15:49.353 --> 1:15:51.449
I am not your blood!

1:15:51.489 --> 1:15:54.485
Oh, I think we're
quite alike you and I,

1:15:54.525 --> 1:15:58.389
we both share the same
thirst for butchery.

1:16:00.498 --> 1:16:02.765
Killing your own
brother in battle,

1:16:03.901 --> 1:16:06.798
that's the kind of blood lust
that's in our bones, Hal.

1:16:06.838 --> 1:16:09.033
Bones that I'd like
to break, old man.

1:16:09.073 --> 1:16:10.835
Why is it so fucking
difficult for you

1:16:10.875 --> 1:16:12.770
to accept my intentions?

1:16:12.810 --> 1:16:15.440
You think you're so
mighty, so powerful.

1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:17.408
Well this is power, Hal!

1:16:21.219 --> 1:16:23.147
A gift you refuse to accept.

1:16:23.187 --> 1:16:26.718
I don't need to trade
my humanity to be great!

1:16:26.758 --> 1:16:28.152
You coward!

1:16:28.192 --> 1:16:30.888
That's the only reason
why you despise me.

1:16:30.928 --> 1:16:31.827
Great?

1:16:33.998 --> 1:16:36.294
You think you're
so great, do you?

1:16:36.334 --> 1:16:38.896
Look at you,
captured, shivering.

1:16:38.936 --> 1:16:42.834
Well before you die,
let's see the tenderfoot

1:16:42.874 --> 1:16:45.503
accept his allegiance is to me,

1:16:45.543 --> 1:16:48.043
and not to my pitiable progeny.

1:16:51.149 --> 1:16:52.376
Leave the boy alone, father.

1:16:52.416 --> 1:16:53.883
I will not.

1:16:55.453 --> 1:16:58.020
Let's see where
his loyalties lie.

1:16:59.490 --> 1:17:03.154
I want you to witness
the weakness of men,

1:17:03.194 --> 1:17:06.195
the inadequacy of what you
so desperately cling to.

1:17:09.300 --> 1:17:10.499
Ready Hal?

1:17:11.302 --> 1:17:12.835
Let's see you scream.

1:17:17.008 --> 1:17:17.907
Stop!

1:17:19.877 --> 1:17:20.609
Stop it!

1:17:29.420 --> 1:17:31.554
I offer you one chance boy,

1:17:33.291 --> 1:17:37.593
join with us or suffer the
same ignominious defeat.

1:17:40.598 --> 1:17:42.031
Don't do it Thorfinn.

1:17:45.369 --> 1:17:46.268
Thorfinn!

1:17:48.539 --> 1:17:50.272
I will join you.

1:17:52.043 --> 1:17:54.005
Again.

1:17:54.045 --> 1:17:59.114
I will join you!

1:18:08.025 --> 1:18:10.626
Sorry Hal, but you see, I win.

1:18:15.533 --> 1:18:20.603
No, no!

1:18:30.081 --> 1:18:32.081
Turn him.

1:20:13.050 --> 1:20:16.785
No, no, you're meant
to be one of us now!

1:21:37.134 --> 1:21:38.700
Fucking bite me.

1:24:29.373 --> 1:24:30.606
Time to die.

1:24:39.383 --> 1:24:42.513
Better
to die a man...

1:27:31.054 --> 1:27:32.220
Thorfinn.

1:27:56.513 --> 1:27:57.846
All are dead.

1:28:01.118 --> 1:28:04.753
The king is dead.

1:28:11.895 --> 1:28:13.662
I am the last wolf.

1:28:26.877 --> 1:28:31.746
For your great and noble
bravery, I dub thee Sir Thorfinn.

1:28:40.190 --> 1:28:44.688
May the gods bless you,
our hero and savior.

1:28:54.304 --> 1:28:58.807
To Thorfinn, to Thorfinn,
to Thorfinn, to Thorfinn!

1:29:05.916 --> 1:29:10.519
To Thorfinn,
to Thorfinn, to Thorfinn!

1:29:15.058 --> 1:29:19.561
To Thorfinn, to Thorfinn,
to Thorfinn, to Thorfinn!
