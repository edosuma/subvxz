WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.138
What's going on?
Nothing.

00:04.172 --> 00:05.806
Ooh, "nothing" means the
best kind of something.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.807
Let me see.
No.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.808
Let me see.
No.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.411
You... Ow!

00:10.444 --> 00:14.248
Will's online
dating profile?

00:14.282 --> 00:17.218
Thank you, Santa.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.919
A lot of people are doing it.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.055
Yeah, a lot of losers.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.390
Oh, cut him some slack.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.392
He's had a hard time meeting
women since the divorce.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.593
And who says
my dream woman

00:25.626 --> 00:26.894
isn't waiting for me
on the Internet?

00:26.927 --> 00:28.996
And who says she
won't turn out to be

00:29.029 --> 00:31.099
a 50-year-old guy
from Encino?

00:32.433 --> 00:33.901
Hi, Will. You like
the picture of me

00:33.934 --> 00:35.403
in the pretty sundress?

00:35.436 --> 00:38.439
Well, surprise,
here are my balls.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.423
This book that
Mommy's making you

00:55.456 --> 00:57.925
is gonna get you into
the best preschool ever.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.428
Aw. Charlie,
here you are at the park.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.430
And here you are
eating ice cream.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.798
And here you are
playing first cello

01:04.832 --> 01:06.134
with the L.A.
Symphony Orchestra.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.537
Thank you, Photoshop.
Wow, honey.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.105
Applying to preschool's
really brought out

01:11.139 --> 01:13.107
the crazy-ass crazy in you.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.908
Okay, Crestlake kids get into
the best elementary schools,

01:14.942 --> 01:15.976
and then the best high schools,

01:16.009 --> 01:18.312
and then, of course,
the best colleges.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.881
Charlie, this book is just
gonna make the other toddlers

01:20.914 --> 01:23.451
look like a bunch of d-bags.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.785
Come on, big boy.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.620
Let's go put the best diaper
on that best butt.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.289
Here we go.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.124
Guys, something
terrible happened.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.992
My assistant's mother died.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.794
That is terrible.

01:33.827 --> 01:38.166
I know. She's taking
the whole week off.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.502
Well, if you need
an assistant, I can do it.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.003
I don't have any
auditions this week,

01:43.036 --> 01:44.472
and I could really
use the money.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.908
Oh, yeah, it's just that
I need someone who's efficient,

01:47.941 --> 01:50.478
discreet, detail-oriented.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.913
Sounds like you
don't think I can do it.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.183
Oh, good, then I'm being clear.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.185
See, here's the thing.

01:57.218 --> 02:00.654
Working for Kate
can be very... difficult.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.657
I'm sorry, honey, I just really
need someone who's professional.

02:03.691 --> 02:07.595
Oh, you still blame me
for the Delta Pi Spring Formal.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.331
You beg to be my co-chair,
and I let you.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.832
But you screwed up
the booze order,

02:11.865 --> 02:13.701
and we ran out
of drinks by 9:00.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.170
I had to have sex
with a freshman...

02:16.204 --> 02:18.038
sober.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.673
Okay, that was ten years ago.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.542
Please just give me a chance.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.677
All right, fine.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.813
Plus, I can get you
cheaper than a real person,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.215
so let's give it a shot.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.351
I'm gonna
be the best assistant ever.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.919
Don't use that voice at work.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.724
Hi, Lowell.
Hey.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.359
Hi. Can we have two
coffees to go, please?

02:38.392 --> 02:39.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.794
Yeah, we're kind
of in a hurry

02:40.828 --> 02:42.296
to get to this
preschool interview.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.865
Aw, our Charlie's
going to preschool.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.033
Oh, if we get in.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.801
I just, I can't believe
that you wore jeans.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.970
Why didn't you wear
what I laid out for you?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.905
'Cause I'm not three.
Okay, let's go over it

02:51.939 --> 02:53.807
one more time.
We don't need
to go over it

02:53.841 --> 02:55.243
one more time.
Okay, you say that,

02:55.276 --> 02:56.710
but then you get in the room,

02:56.744 --> 02:58.546
you get nervous, and
you just fall apart.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.481
So, remember.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.882
Don't over-nod.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.984
Mm-hmm. Don't keep
saying "awesome."

03:04.017 --> 03:05.553
I will try to
contain my awesomes.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.055
And don't answer a question
with a question.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.257
We clear?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.492
Why don't you just shove
your hand up my ass

03:11.525 --> 03:14.395
and operate my mouth?

03:14.428 --> 03:15.896
Question with a question.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.098
And, yes, if that were an
option, we'd already be there.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.904
Look at the parents
in this brochure.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.907
Okay? Gay, lesbian,
Indian, handicapped.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.909
Handicapped and
Indian-- lucky.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.580
We are so ordinary, we
don't have a prayer.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.682
Why do we have to
be so Caucasian?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.584
Andi, will you
stop worrying?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.919
She's gonna love us, she's
gonna love the album you made.

03:38.952 --> 03:39.920
Oh, my God, the album.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.422
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.123
I left the album
at Namaste.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.124
We've got nothing.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.426
No, we're good people.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.527
We love our son.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.296
We have nothing.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.432
Good morning, I'm
Frances Bowmont.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.766
Shall we?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.935
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Bowmont-Shall We.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.905
He's being funny.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.440
Don't be funny.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.108
Please, follow me,
and let's find out

04:01.141 --> 04:03.444
if you and Crestlake
are a good fit.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.146
Okay, I guess
it's do-or-die time.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.548
Now or never.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.883
All comes down to this.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.321
Come on, let's go.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.494
Well, then.

04:20.528 --> 04:21.962
How are we today?

04:21.995 --> 04:23.130
Good, good.
Yeah.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.733
So good, we're really,
we're just so good.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.568
And, um...

04:27.601 --> 04:29.903
plus, also, I might add,
uh, lovers of education.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.305
And Charlie, too,
he loves it.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.240
He loves math
and science and the, uh,

04:33.273 --> 04:35.609
the-the English and...
all the other ones.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.045
All the educations.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.181
Are you okay?

04:41.214 --> 04:43.417
Me?

04:43.451 --> 04:44.785
I'm awesome.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.690
Good morning, Ms. Pearce.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.258
Hey, Jules, would
you like a muffin?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.526
Oh, no, I'm good, actually.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.094
Don't like to eat
on the job.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.195
That was a friendship offer,

04:55.228 --> 04:56.664
and you gave me a
business response.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.699
Excellent.
Oh.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.033
That's not a real
muffin, anyway.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.535
It's a scented candle.

05:01.569 --> 05:02.936
Now as you know,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.339
I manage the online
presence of celebrities,

05:05.373 --> 05:08.008
so you can't freak out
if, say, BeyoncÃ© calls.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.678
I would say,
"Hello, Mrs. Carter."

05:10.711 --> 05:14.882
Inside, I'd be doing my happy
dance, but she would never know.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.116
Excellent.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.185
Uh, now, I need you
to get Andi a gift

05:18.218 --> 05:20.153
to thank her for recommending
a birthing class

05:20.187 --> 05:21.855
to one of Justin
Bieber's people.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.691
So, just pick out
something she'll like.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.993
Are you sure
you trust me to do this?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.628
I mean, you're
a legendary gift giver.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.296
There's no way I can
compete with that.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.531
I know, I'm
just really busy.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.132
Last night, Rihanna
assaulted a stewardess

05:32.165 --> 05:33.967
with an airsickness bag.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.904
So, I'm just
really stressed out.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.572
Light my muffin.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.710
That is when
we realized that Charlie

05:42.743 --> 05:45.245
had some deep
insights into life.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.381
So, he's two?

05:47.415 --> 05:49.282
He's whatever age
you want him to be.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.622
Well, I think I've heard enough.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.528
Oh, g'day, g'day.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.862
Sorry I didn't
get here sooner.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.564
I got the brief
history of our Charlie.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.899
This place is great.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.436
All the green space,
the sustainable playground,

06:08.469 --> 06:09.837
the solar panels.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.372
And that garden?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.942
I just love the idea
of Charlie running around here,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.411
growing his own snacks.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.448
Sustainability's very
important to us here.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.749
Oh, and good on you.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.350
Bringing it home
for our Charlie.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.085
You know, I'm a little confused.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.589
Why do you keep referring
to their son as "our Charlie"?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.062
Because he's the dad.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.530
Say again?

06:36.564 --> 06:39.433
I thought Dr. McAllister
was the dad.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.901
Well...
Uh, he is, he is.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.703
Of course I'm...
He an Lowell.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.771
They're gay.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.872
They're-they're...

06:44.905 --> 06:46.306
They're, uh,
they're-they're...

06:46.339 --> 06:47.975
They're gay dads.
Two gay dads.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.110
And I'm the, uh, the-the...

06:50.143 --> 06:51.445
the surrogate.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.947
Got another one in the oven
'cause I just...

06:53.981 --> 06:56.149
love me some
gay, gay dads.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.952
Two dads,

06:58.986 --> 07:00.954
and a highly involved
surrogate mother.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.289
Mm-hmm.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.325
We don't have one of those.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.636
I'm back!
Where have you been?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.170
The phone's
been blowing up.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.439
Oh, I've been searching
like crazy for Andi's gift.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.642
I-I broke a nail,
I broke a heel,

07:21.675 --> 07:23.977
But I finally
found the perfect silver...
Jules,

07:24.011 --> 07:26.313
I don't have time for this.
Just handle it like an adult.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.319
Kate Pearce's office.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.654
Jules, it's Will.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.688
Put Kate on.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.923
Hold a moment.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.325
It's a Dr. William Stokes
on the line.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.827
Okay, here's a list
of three things.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.261
Do them all first.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.530
On it.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.931
You have 30 seconds. Go.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.298
Hey, remember how you said
that online dating

07:45.332 --> 07:46.634
was just for losers?

07:46.667 --> 07:49.336
Well, this loser is
getting a ton of winks

07:49.369 --> 07:51.204
from some very attractive women.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.339
Russian brides?

07:52.372 --> 07:53.473
Lady Hobbits?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.509
The incontinent?

07:55.543 --> 07:58.512
Joke all you want, but I find it
ironic that you mock me,

07:58.546 --> 08:02.516
and yet I am crushing it,
while you are all alone.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.552
I have plenty of dates, Will.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.953
No, you have plenty of sex

08:05.986 --> 08:07.220
with questionable men.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.356
I don't need to go online
to meet eligible men.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.391
I get it. You're afraid
you won't get any winks.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.126
Please, I would get
a ton of winks.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.628
Really? I think
you'd be winkless.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.864
I would out-wink you ten to one.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.031
I doubt it.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.200
I'm Abraham Winkin.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.704
I'm Rip Van Winkle.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.739
I'm the Wink Panther.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.242
Oh, I am a delight.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.512
Winkless.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.384
All right, eHarmony,
I will give you a shot.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.653
Five words to describe me.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.656
Strong, powerful,

08:42.690 --> 08:46.526
driven, relentless...

08:46.560 --> 08:48.562
fun.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.702
Bobby, please,
can we just let it go?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.269
Oh, yeah, you're right.
What's the big deal?

08:56.303 --> 08:59.172
I mean, I woke up this
morning married to a woman,

08:59.206 --> 09:00.774
and now I'm married to a man.

09:00.808 --> 09:04.612
I'm sorry. I-I saw us going
down in flames and I panicked.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.714
No, no. We weren't
going down in flames,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.515
you were going
down in flames.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.750
With your awesomes
and your nodding

09:09.783 --> 09:11.852
and all the things
you told me not to do.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.587
I'm sorry, I got nervous.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.088
It's unethical,
not to mention crazy.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.757
Andi, call her and
tell her the truth.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.759
Fine.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.894
You're up.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.096
Hi, girls.
Hey.
Hi.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.598
So, how'd it go at work?

09:24.632 --> 09:27.267
Jules was
fantastically adequate.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.368
Oh.
Aw, thank you.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.770
Sure. Uh, so listen,

09:29.803 --> 09:31.805
we're on our way
to spin, but

09:31.839 --> 09:33.907
I wanted to drop a little
something off for you

09:33.941 --> 09:35.943
to thank you for helping
me with the Bieber thing.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.277
Aw.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.481
Silver elephant
salt and pepper shakers.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.316
They're beautiful.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.118
You remembered
that I love elephants.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.119
Yeah, yeah.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.455
Of course, elephants...

09:48.488 --> 09:50.023
are your thing.
Yeah.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.960
Actually, I-I'm the one who...

09:52.993 --> 09:54.628
Understands the distinction

09:54.662 --> 09:57.164
between professional
and personal,

09:57.197 --> 10:00.100
assistant and friend.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.704
Alive and dead.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.008
I just had
a fantastic date.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.343
Her name's Lila, and I think
she could be a keeper.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.946
We met for coffee,
coffee turned into a walk,

10:12.980 --> 10:16.416
a walk evolved into meaningful
stares, suggestive silences

10:16.449 --> 10:18.051
and provocative
hand-holding.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.154
So you're saying
you spent the afternoon

10:21.188 --> 10:23.356
at a seventh grade dance.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.261
I'm bringing her
to dinner on Friday.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.664
Whoa, dinner
with the group?

10:30.698 --> 10:32.099
Bold move.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.434
Bold guy.
Mm.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.336
Hope you won't feel weird being
the only one without a date.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.205
Actually, I didn't
tell you this before,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.507
but I, too, have found
someone fantastic

10:40.540 --> 10:43.343
with real long-term potential.

10:43.376 --> 10:47.014
Wink back, wink back,
wink back, wink back.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.851
One of you bastards has
got to be free Friday night.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.519
Kate?

10:52.552 --> 10:54.654
Uh, not now, I'm...

10:54.688 --> 10:56.356
masturbating.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.394
And I finished.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.368
Here is
the Victoria Beckham file,

11:08.401 --> 11:10.003
the monthly financials,

11:10.037 --> 11:13.874
and here's the Stab Your
Friends in the Heart file.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.543
Well, this does not seem
like it's going to be good.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.646
This is a list of all
the gifts "you've" bought

11:19.679 --> 11:20.981
for the last five years.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.750
I found it on Denise's computer.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.552
Well, I don't think Denise would
appreciate you snooping...

11:25.585 --> 11:27.721
You haven't picked
one gift for any of us.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.724
Kate, you always talk about
personal versus professional,

11:30.758 --> 11:32.860
and now you're using
professional for personal,

11:32.893 --> 11:34.394
and personally,
I find that unprofessional,

11:34.427 --> 11:35.395
and I'm telling everyone.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.930
No, you're not.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.698
Because I own everything
you do and learn

11:38.732 --> 11:40.567
in this office
from 9:00 to 5:00.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.669
That is what it means
to be professional.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.572
So grow a thicker skin...
and let's go get a drink,

11:45.605 --> 11:47.274
'cause it's 5:01, girl!

11:47.307 --> 11:49.276
What what?
Friendship time!

11:53.313 --> 11:55.648
All right,
I'll catch you at the bar.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.757
Hello?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.625
Yes, this is she.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.295
Really?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.263
Absolutely, yes,
we'll be there.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.765
Great, thank you.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.267
Guess who made it to
their second round of interviews

12:14.301 --> 12:15.635
at Crestlake Hills?

12:15.668 --> 12:17.037
That's great!

12:17.070 --> 12:19.639
And we didn't have to fabricate
a crazy gay dad story.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.642
You didn't call.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.311
I did...

12:24.344 --> 12:25.846
not call. Lowell?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.482
Are you free Monday at 11:00
for a second interview?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.785
Absolutely!
Anything for our Charlie.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.954
All right, so, what,
so if I don't go along

12:33.987 --> 12:35.989
with this, I'm
the bad guy, right?

12:36.023 --> 12:37.657
Exactly.
You'd be a monster.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.661
Okay, so, if we get in,

12:41.694 --> 12:43.797
Lowell and I are supposed
to pretend to be married

12:43.831 --> 12:44.965
for the next
three years?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.399
No, of course not.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.635
If we get in,
you guys will break up.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.971
You'll be two divorced gay dads.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.507
Oh, see, I don't know;
divorce is really hard on kids.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.676
Maybe we should
stay together for Charlie.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.753
Okay, dads.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.788
Let's put our heads together.
We need to come up

13:08.822 --> 13:10.423
with a background story
of how you two met.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.658
So do you have
any ideas?

13:11.691 --> 13:13.827
Okay, how about
if we met surfing?

13:13.861 --> 13:16.029
Yes, see that-that
sounds cool.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.665
I like that,
I love that, I do, I do.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.601
But what if instead of surfing,
you guys met at a museum?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.436
Okay, yeah.
Mm.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.038
Uh-huh.
I like surfing.

13:25.072 --> 13:28.041
I-I still think, Bobby,
that your idea about the museum,

13:28.075 --> 13:29.209
so much stronger.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.710
Let's just stick
with that, okay?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.514
She's a tough one, Bob.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.884
At least we got each other.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.887
So you guys
met online?

13:39.920 --> 13:40.888
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.689
I winked at him,
and then we met,

13:42.722 --> 13:45.525
and he turned out to be
so open and honest

13:45.558 --> 13:47.394
and handsome.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.130
I-I wouldn't say
handsome, but...

13:50.163 --> 13:52.900
I mean, since you did.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.035
You guys are so cute.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.569
We are cute.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.806
I am here with my date.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.409
Spoiler alert: he's delightful.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.545
How are you. Bobby.
Hey, Tim Kayler.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.880
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.848
Hey, Tim Kayler.
Nice to meet you.

14:08.882 --> 14:09.983
Tim Kayler. Pleasure.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.452
I'm Lowell.
Fantastic.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.655
Hi, I'm Will.
This is my date, Lila.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.390
And this is my
date, Tim Kayler.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.459
How you doing?
Tim Kayler.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.163
CEO of Kayler
Microdevices.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.264
Oh, really?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.498
What is a microdevice?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.534
Oh, God, they're integral
to everything,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.436
from the toys
our children play with

14:29.469 --> 14:32.105
to the nerve gas that
kills our enemies.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.774
How'd you two meet?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.109
Online.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.677
Online?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.179
Funny story.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.881
My company makes the servers
that power the site.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.351
God's honest truth.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.618
Tim Kayler.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.422
We just met.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.091
Okay, great to reconnect.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.793
Hey, anybody else thirsty?

14:53.826 --> 14:56.096
I brought
a mind-boggling Barolo.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.430
Oh, I love
Italian wine.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.765
You got to love Italian wine!

14:58.798 --> 15:00.133
Am I right?

15:00.167 --> 15:03.203
Yeah, why don't we, uh,
go ahead and open up this...

15:03.236 --> 15:05.438
mind-boggling Italian
wine for you guys.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.640
I'm full of baby, so
I'm just gonna watch.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.444
So, uh, I thought you said

15:11.478 --> 15:13.780
online dating was
just for losers.

15:13.813 --> 15:14.781
Oh, I thought it was,

15:14.814 --> 15:16.616
but when I saw how
well you were doing,

15:16.649 --> 15:18.118
I decided to
stick my toe in,

15:18.151 --> 15:20.988
and that little piggy found
itself some Tim Kayler.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.125
You know what?
I'm-I'm just happy you're happy.

15:25.158 --> 15:29.562
And I'm happy my date blows
your date out of the water.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.464
You don't even know Lila.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.900
Is she a millionaire
with a private jet?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.235
'Cause you know who is?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.770
Salute!

15:37.804 --> 15:39.339
Salute.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.675
Tim Kayler.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.313
Hey, did you guys hear
Lila works for a foundation

15:46.346 --> 15:48.515
that feeds children
in Africa?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.683
We put together packages
to send to impoverished

15:50.717 --> 15:52.352
and war-torn areas.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.088
Just when you think Lila
can't get any better, bam!

15:55.122 --> 15:57.657
Some poor kid in Africa
gets his belly filled.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.927
Wait, are you with
Hands Across Africa?

16:00.960 --> 16:04.597
Kayler Microdevices is a proud
sponsor of Hands Across Africa!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.167
Do you hear that?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.936
My date sponsors
your date,

16:09.969 --> 16:13.006
so suck it.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.875
Oh, this one.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.844
She's a firecracker.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.679
I want to take
you to Paris.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.181
Oh, my God.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.882
You hear that?

16:22.915 --> 16:25.852
Yeah, I heard it;
I'm right here.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.020
Wow, Paris.
That's amazing.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.955
How come you never
take me to Paris?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.490
If I'm taking
anybody to Paris,

16:30.523 --> 16:31.858
it's gonna be
my husband.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.395
Bob, you're the best.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.699
It's funny because you
mocked me for being single,

16:39.732 --> 16:41.034
and yet here I am

16:41.068 --> 16:43.370
with the perfect date.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.306
So, when are we
going to Paris?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.575
Tomorrow.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.277
And that's when I'm
gonna put a baby in you.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.417
What?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.919
Mm-hmm. You will
give birth to my heir.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.021
And if it's a girl,
we'll just keep trying

17:02.055 --> 17:03.256
till you get it right.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.928
Salute!

17:16.136 --> 17:19.206
You may want to
come back in here;

17:19.239 --> 17:21.241
he's talking baby names.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.579
Do you want to torture me,
or can I just admit defeat?

17:26.613 --> 17:28.748
You won, okay?
Congratulations.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.684
Kate, it was never
supposed to be a competition.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.953
Yeah, I know, it's just...

17:33.986 --> 17:37.090
you know, when you met someone
you actually liked, I panicked.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.925
One date.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.261
Yeah, but look how fast
it happened for Jules.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.796
I mean, up until today,

17:43.830 --> 17:46.833
you and I were
partners in misery.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.436
Now...

17:49.469 --> 17:53.340
what if I end up being the only
single one left in our group?

17:56.476 --> 17:59.146
What if I never
find anyone?

18:01.148 --> 18:02.682
You will.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.118
You're great.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.053
You're-you're too great
to be summed up

18:07.086 --> 18:09.356
in an online dating profile.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.826
You're an amazing, strong,
beautiful woman.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.831
Tim Kayler wouldn't
put his baby in just anyone.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.136
Come on, let's go
make fun of him together.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.473
I'd like that.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.977
What's going on?
Where's Lila?

18:31.010 --> 18:34.647
She excused herself to go
to the bathroom and left.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.749
With all of our wallets.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.618
What?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.953
No, she didn't,
mine's right...

18:40.987 --> 18:42.088
Son of a...

18:42.121 --> 18:45.292
So, Little Miss
Feed the Children is a criminal.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.927
Which means you lose,
I win, and it's too late

18:47.960 --> 18:51.531
to take back all those
nice things you said.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.100
Oh, hey, good news everybody!

18:54.133 --> 18:56.135
She didn't take my cocaine!

18:59.839 --> 19:01.841
All right, it's a tie.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.313
Okay, one last time.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.315
Your hobbies include
racquetball and antiquing.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.682
Okay.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.784
Okay, you know what?
Let me deal with the backstory,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.420
you guys just sit there
and look pretty.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.057
I'm ready for you.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.493
Oh, uh, just the parents.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.728
Oh.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.365
Interesting.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.466
Just the parents.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.735
You know,
I never did hear

19:28.768 --> 19:30.370
how the two
of you met.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.272
Oh, surfing.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.315
Mrs. Bowmont!
I love it,
I love that.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.716
Oh, my goodness.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.552
Congratulations.
Here's your enrollment packet.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.686
Thank you.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.187
I look forward
to seeing you soon.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.188
See you soon.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.657
Enrollment packet?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.325
We've been accepted.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.662
Oh, my God,
that's awesome!

19:55.695 --> 19:57.564
Turns out, they like
a gay surfing couple

19:57.597 --> 19:59.232
who doesn't like
racquetball or antiquing.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.204
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.206
I know that I've just
been so crazy lately,

20:07.240 --> 20:08.408
but I just...

20:08.441 --> 20:10.109
I needed to make
sure that Charlie

20:10.142 --> 20:11.844
was going to be
in the best hands.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.013
It's okay. And I know
preschool's a big step.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.515
For you and Charlie.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.750
I love you.
Get over here.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.751
I love you.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.420
Aw, see,
that's romance, that is...

20:20.453 --> 20:21.421
bloody disgusting!

20:21.454 --> 20:23.155
Get off my husband!

20:28.261 --> 20:30.096
What if we had
some kind of freaky

20:30.129 --> 20:31.230
three-way thing
going on?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.132
Do you have
one of those?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.739
Jules, those shoes
are gorgeous.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.475
Thank you.
Kate got them for me.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.377
I did?

20:44.411 --> 20:45.445
Yes, remember?

20:45.478 --> 20:48.147
To thank me for being
such a great assistant.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.617
So professional
and so discreet.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.386
Ah, now I remember.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.755
You are such
a good gift giver.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.292
I mean, these are so me
and clearly so expensive.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.093
Bracelet, too?

21:01.127 --> 21:03.596
Oh. So generous.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.265
You're fired.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.535
