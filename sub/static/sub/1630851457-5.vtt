00:25.291 --> 00:27.208
Many generations have passed

00:27.291 --> 00:30.916
since the light
of the Jedi protected the galaxy.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.125
Since then, an era of war has arisen.

00:34.208 --> 00:39.416
But Margrave Juro,
ruler of the planet Hy Izlan, has a plan.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.291
He has recently begun mining for
rare kyber crystals within his territory.

00:44.375 --> 00:47.833
Using these crystals,
he seeks to restore the Jedi

00:47.916 --> 00:52.041
by reforging their ancient weapons,
lightsabers,

00:52.125 --> 00:54.875
which have since been lost to the galaxy.

00:54.958 --> 01:00.208
However, ancient dark forces conspire
to subjugate the galaxy.

01:00.291 --> 01:04.666
They hatch their own sinister plan
to hunt all suspected Jedi

01:04.750 --> 01:08.666
and bring forth a new era of Sith rule.

02:24.916 --> 02:26.875
Greetings. My name is Ethan.

02:26.958 --> 02:31.208
I'm here because I received
this encoded transmission summoning me.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.125
The Force is strong here.

02:37.833 --> 02:41.958
While I am without a master,
I feel the Force within me.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.333
It appears that you
are all masterless Jedi too.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.833
Is that correct?

02:53.500 --> 02:57.916
Each of us came here in answer
to the same call, just as you have.

03:02.166 --> 03:05.166
So then, do we believe this message
to be authentic?

03:07.166 --> 03:11.208
I call on the Jedi
hidden across the galaxy.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.916
My name is Juro.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.833
I am the ruler of Hy Izlan,
located in the Outer Rim,

03:17.916 --> 03:21.458
and I am seeking
to restore the Jedi Order.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.958
If you have received this message,

03:24.041 --> 03:28.500
then I invite you
to the Aerial Temple of Hy Izlan.

03:28.583 --> 03:34.333
There I will present you with
one of the long-lost weapons of the

03:34.416 --> 03:35.833
a lightsaber.

03:35.916 --> 03:42.666
Join me in the fight to unite
our war-torn galaxy and restore peace.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.250
I will be waiting.

03:44.916 --> 03:49.708
I cannot say if Margrave Juro has actually
been able to recreate lightsabers,

03:49.791 --> 03:54.500
but it is true that there is a deposit
of kyber crystals on the planet below.

03:54.583 --> 03:58.041
We too have heard this rumor
of the existence of kyber crystals

03:58.125 --> 03:59.125
at this location.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.791
But that is of no concern to us.

04:03.250 --> 04:07.250
The real issue is
whether this Juro can be trusted or not.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.458
He has a point.

04:16.541 --> 04:21.166
Who's to say if Juro is really
a master Jedi or if this is a trap?

04:25.375 --> 04:28.416
Is there no one here
who has ever met this Juro before?

04:32.500 --> 04:35.291
If this is some kind of trap to kill Jedi,

04:35.375 --> 04:38.166
did everyone show up here
believing that they could survive it?

04:38.250 --> 04:41.583
Were you all so confident
that you would not be bested,

04:41.666 --> 04:45.625
or did you decide it was worth the risk
just to obtain a lightsaber?

04:46.708 --> 04:49.000
Maybe they think
they're strong enough with the Force

04:49.083 --> 04:50.833
to be able to protect themselves.

04:53.125 --> 04:57.083
The Force.
You said that it was strong here,

04:57.875 --> 05:00.833
but I sense the dark side in this place.

05:10.916 --> 05:14.916
I see the seven Jedi
have already gathered.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.541
Hmm. It is true that the margrave
often frightens others

05:19.625 --> 05:21.416
because of his appearance,

05:21.500 --> 05:24.833
but he is just an eccentric old man

05:24.916 --> 05:27.833
who is not fond
of being cooped up in his castle.

05:28.416 --> 05:31.083
He does not often appear
in front of others,

05:31.166 --> 05:34.333
but today is the day
he promised to meet you.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.625
So I am sure he will arrive soon.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.041
Hmm.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.916
I'm back.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.125
Father, we found a pretty big one
out there today.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.583
Did you manage to finish
all those sabers for the margrave?

07:08.666 --> 07:09.666
Yes.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.833
-Wow, it's really long.

07:16.833 --> 07:19.750
Interesting.
So you can change the length on this one?

07:23.750 --> 07:26.750
Actually, I've tempered
the kyber crystals on each lightsaber

07:26.833 --> 07:29.708
so it reflects the user's connection
with the Force.

07:29.791 --> 07:33.166
The color and the length will vary
depending on the Jedi using it.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.750
Oh. I guess my connection
to the Force isn't strong enough,

07:36.833 --> 07:39.000
since the blade doesn't have
any real color.

07:39.666 --> 07:43.000
Hmm. You do have some natural talent
with a lightsaber, Kara,

07:43.083 --> 07:46.000
but your connection will grow in time
with proper training.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.166
Remember that while the Force exists
in every living thing,

07:50.250 --> 07:53.041
only those individuals
who develop their connection to it

07:53.125 --> 07:54.708
will have the power to wield it.

07:55.291 --> 07:58.041
But you won't need to worry
about all that quite yet.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.125
I guess so.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.083
But I wonder what color
this lightsaber will turn

08:02.166 --> 08:04.583
when it's finally in the hands
of a real Jedi.

08:08.458 --> 08:11.458
I kept my promise,
and I actually finished them on time.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.416
What's wrong, Four-Nines?

08:22.750 --> 08:24.375
Is that one of the Jedi ships?

08:24.875 --> 08:28.083
Unlikely, since they were summoned
to the Aerial Temple.

08:43.875 --> 08:47.208
Kara, I need you to take these
to the temple immediately.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.958
Oh, wait.
You're not gonna deliver them?

08:50.041 --> 08:53.416
No. I'll be too busy looking after
our newly arrived visitors.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.500
Oh.

08:56.625 --> 08:57.708
Hmm?

09:00.833 --> 09:03.041
You've grown up so much, Kara.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.833
You're all strange, like this is
the last time we'll see each other.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.166
Kara…

09:17.750 --> 09:20.583
be careful, and may the Force be with you.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.083
-Now go.

09:28.541 --> 09:30.458
Are you the sabersmith Lah Zhima?

09:31.166 --> 09:32.166
I am.

09:32.916 --> 09:37.166
You have illicitly manufactured
several lightsabers for masterless Jedi.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.500
And where exactly did you get that from?

09:40.583 --> 09:44.083
From the one
who enlisted your services to make them.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.166
Hmm.

09:46.333 --> 09:50.041
Lah Zhima, you will hand over
the illegal lightsabers and come with us.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.541
Oh, yeah?
And what happens if I refuse?

09:52.625 --> 09:55.041
Refusal is not an option.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.708
Father, no!

10:06.541 --> 10:07.791
Kara, just go!

10:07.875 --> 10:08.875
Silence!

10:11.125 --> 10:12.125
Follow her!

10:21.541 --> 10:23.291
If we are to believe these claims,

10:23.375 --> 10:26.458
the margrave is gathering
all the Jedi in the galaxy,

10:26.541 --> 10:29.291
all as part of an effort
to try to end the war.

10:29.791 --> 10:32.458
I would like to see evidence of this
before he arrives.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.541
Evidence?

10:36.416 --> 10:40.041
Yes. Did the margrave
actually construct any lightsabers?

10:41.666 --> 10:43.666
Is this what you desire?

10:54.625 --> 10:56.208
May I please hold it?

10:56.291 --> 11:00.250
By the time I was born, lightsabers
were already lost from the galaxy.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.666
A lightsaber. A real lightsaber.

11:19.208 --> 11:23.333
The remaining sabers
should be arriving very shortly.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.625
The Force is strong in this child.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.333
Old droid!

13:12.083 --> 13:16.333
Please. I need for you to take us
to the Aerial Temple immediately!

13:24.416 --> 13:29.375
I'm on my break.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.625
-Find another pilot.

13:36.791 --> 13:41.625
Well, it's gotta be you, since it seems
you're the only one functioning.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
Please. I don't have any time.
Just take this and get me to the temple.

13:47.625 --> 13:51.875
I might as well.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.416
Come on, then.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.166
Just hurry up!

14:11.083 --> 14:13.666
Just how long are we expected
to wait here?

14:21.666 --> 14:24.583
-Something's coming.
-Do you think it's the margrave's ship?

14:38.083 --> 14:39.333
Father.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.458
-Thank you, old droid.
-Don't mention it.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.083
Are you…

14:58.750 --> 15:00.916
I'm-- My name is Kara.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.375
I'm the daughter
of the sabersmith Lah Zhima.

15:04.666 --> 15:06.333
The sabersmith?

15:06.416 --> 15:08.750
So you're the one
with the lightsabers then.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.958
Yes. But my father was caught
and taken away by the Jedi Hunters.

15:14.958 --> 15:17.291
Please, use these to help me save him!

15:23.791 --> 15:27.416
But where is the margrave? Is he not here?

15:28.083 --> 15:29.791
Hold on. Do you know the margrave?

15:29.875 --> 15:32.500
Yeah.
I've known him ever since I was a baby.

15:35.291 --> 15:40.458
Hmm. So then, does that mean you might
possibly know where he could be right now?

15:43.375 --> 15:46.500
Something doesn't feel right.
I don't think we have a choice.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.916
We'll have to wait
for the margrave to arrive.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.333
That color…

15:57.250 --> 15:59.541
No, no, no. You're all…

16:01.041 --> 16:02.541
-I see.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.958
Your wait is over.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.250
I have been here the entire time.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.750
It's the margrave!

16:23.375 --> 16:24.833
How pathetic, Juro.

16:24.916 --> 16:27.708
You would disguise yourself
as a droid to spy on us?

16:27.791 --> 16:31.083
We are acolytes of the Sith
and sworn to the dark side.

16:31.166 --> 16:36.208
And we are here to put an end to your
pitiful plans of restoring the Jedi Order.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.666
Now die, Juro!

16:47.875 --> 16:48.791
Hanbei!

16:55.750 --> 16:58.833
Our hunters have taken your father
to a distant star system

16:58.916 --> 17:00.833
where you'll never see him again.

17:00.916 --> 17:03.333
And any attempt to rescue him
will result in failure.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.458
Nice moves.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.333
Roden!

17:43.041 --> 17:44.500
Die!

17:58.083 --> 17:59.500
Niizo.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.625
Just who are you?

18:11.833 --> 18:14.041
You will suffer, Juro!

18:31.375 --> 18:33.458
Oh, no! Help the margrave!

18:55.666 --> 18:57.875
Juro!

19:13.125 --> 19:14.291
That's enough!

19:14.916 --> 19:17.000
We both know this isn't you, Homen.

19:21.458 --> 19:24.958
I apologize.
I became consumed by the others' darkness.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.791
I'm so sorry, Kara.

19:31.875 --> 19:35.458
I recently learned that a number of Jedi
who answered my call were killed

19:35.541 --> 19:37.500
and Sith were sent in their place.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.916
So I hid myself in their presence
in order to determine who was Sith,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.541
but because of that,
they learned about your father,

19:44.625 --> 19:46.541
and I could not be there to help.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.166
Will you help me save him?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.375
Of course I will, my child.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.833
Margrave Juro.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.375
You summoned me all the way out here,
but in the end,

19:54.458 --> 19:57.208
I'm afraid I was not strong enough
to defeat them.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.833
Don't worry.
You survived the fight, young Ethan.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.791
But then, what about the other Jedi?

20:02.875 --> 20:05.958
I sense them. They are not lost.

20:06.041 --> 20:09.458
They are still wandering out there,
somewhere in the galaxy.

20:15.416 --> 20:20.541
Kara, you have been guided by the Force
ever since the moment you were born.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.041
Come and follow me.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.875
Help us restore peace to the galaxy
and take your place as the ninth Jedi

20:25.958 --> 20:28.208
so we can reestablish the Jedi Order.
