00:02.105 --> 00:04.185
Go to the police and
tell them everything you know.

00:04.263 --> 00:06.494
I could be in Rikers for months
before my name is cleared.

00:06.585 --> 00:08.213
I'm supposed to be in the
New Dick Cavett Show next week,

00:08.282 --> 00:09.252
I don't wanna miss that.

00:09.345 --> 00:11.687
Do I have your permission
to marry Emily?

00:11.917 --> 00:14.599
- Yes or no?
- Can I get an extension?

00:14.708 --> 00:16.916
I'm gonna clear my name
and set you free.

00:17.022 --> 00:18.946
Your breath smells like
cat food again!

00:19.035 --> 00:21.947
It's paté, you stoner.

00:22.612 --> 00:23.784
Drop your weapon!

00:23.904 --> 00:25.985
You gotta stop being a detective.
It's too dangerous.

00:26.076 --> 00:27.210
Can't retire just yet.

00:27.303 --> 00:29.222
Still have to find out
who my real dad is.

01:38.759 --> 01:41.165
Dad?

01:41.200 --> 01:44.139
Who would burn down
a sperm bank?

01:44.173 --> 01:46.711
Hey, honey, how are you?
Look what I found at the farm.

01:46.745 --> 01:49.184
Look at that.
It's a free-range chicken.

01:49.218 --> 01:51.355
What? You know I can't eat
a free-range chicken.

01:51.389 --> 01:53.826
I am allergic
to chicken and besides,

01:53.861 --> 01:56.031
I'm a vegetarian...

01:56.065 --> 01:59.238
- Ray, Ray.
- It's not true, leah.

01:59.272 --> 02:00.707
Ray!

02:02.981 --> 02:04.849
Oh yeah, hi.

02:04.884 --> 02:09.158
Go sit with your perverted
uncle Jonathan for a while.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.734
God, he smells good, Ray.

02:13.769 --> 02:16.106
I love to inhale him.

02:16.141 --> 02:19.213
It's better than bacon or sunblock.
He's like baby cocaine.

02:21.051 --> 02:23.956
- That is good stuff.
- It's Darwinian, actually.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.993
They smell so good
so we'll like them.

02:26.027 --> 02:28.531
Shhh!
Stop talking, gay dads.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.703
- Sorry.
- Oh God, I could use a 10-minute nap.

02:31.738 --> 02:35.344
I love being a father once a
week, but it is so draining.

02:35.379 --> 02:38.617
You know, the vigilance, having
to think of somebody else.

02:43.594 --> 02:46.098
I'd hate to be a fireman
when that sperm bank went up.

02:46.132 --> 02:49.337
Think about all those
little semen screams-- "eeeeee!

02:49.372 --> 02:51.007
"Eeee! Save me!"

02:51.042 --> 02:53.345
Thank God you got out of there
before the tragedy.

02:53.379 --> 02:56.284
Yeah, but the problem is the records
are destroyed with the sperm.

02:56.318 --> 02:58.788
I don't know how I'm
gonna find my dad now.

02:58.823 --> 03:02.095
Well look, maybe you don't.
You've got your dad in new Jersey.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.264
You've got George in Manhattan.
You've got me in Brooklyn.

03:04.299 --> 03:06.768
How many father figures in a
90-mile radius do you need?

03:06.803 --> 03:10.008
I have to find him, Ray.
I feel like half a person.

03:10.042 --> 03:11.944
I have this image
of a test tube.

03:11.978 --> 03:14.215
I need to replace it
with the image of a man.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.984
Yeah, I know.

03:16.019 --> 03:18.622
I'd hate for Spencer to think of me
as a urine cup filled with jizz.

03:18.657 --> 03:22.295
- Wow, can you really fill a whole urine cup?
- If I eat sunflower seeds.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.300
Walk me to the subway.
I've gotta go see George.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.838
He wants to prepare me
for Dick Cavett.

03:27.872 --> 03:30.142
I'd say be yourself on Dick
Cavett, that's what I would do.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.777
I mean I'd be me, not you.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.679
That's what everyone says, but I
don't like myself most of the time

03:34.713 --> 03:36.780
and I really need to do
well to help sell the book.

03:36.815 --> 03:38.582
My publisher isn't
very happy with me.

03:38.616 --> 03:40.617
I still say just be
yourself, okay?

03:40.651 --> 03:44.018
Cross your legs like a man and don't wave
your arms around like a little girl.

03:44.053 --> 03:45.587
And don't snack on your thumb.

03:48.523 --> 03:50.123
And the Ferris wheel--
No, carousel!

03:50.158 --> 03:52.225
Carousel was
going round and round

03:52.259 --> 03:54.861
like a mad dream and we
were ducking bullets.

03:54.895 --> 03:57.563
I mean, it was frightening,
but exhilarating.

03:57.597 --> 03:59.632
Wow.
Well, it's great

03:59.666 --> 04:03.368
hearing all these stories about
you and Jonathan, but, um,

04:03.402 --> 04:06.637
there's something Bernard
and I want to show you.

04:06.671 --> 04:08.105
Mmm.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.341
Isn't it beautiful, dad?

04:12.376 --> 04:14.343
It came from
the earth's mantle.

04:14.377 --> 04:17.579
And Emily gave me
a hemp dog collar

04:17.613 --> 04:20.447
as my ceremonial engagement ring.

04:20.483 --> 04:23.584
But I didn't give
my permission yet.

04:23.618 --> 04:26.085
- We couldn't wait, George.
- Yeah, Lisa, our medium,

04:26.120 --> 04:27.754
said we had to act right away.

04:27.788 --> 04:29.355
You went to your
medium before me?

04:29.389 --> 04:33.458
She's telepathic, but <i>she</i>
doesn't mind picking up the phone.

04:33.492 --> 04:35.794
I'm sorry. I was going to
give my permission today.

04:35.828 --> 04:38.329
Just so you know.
Great.

04:38.364 --> 04:41.632
- Congratulations.
- My new dad, huh?

04:41.666 --> 04:44.900
Good, come here.
We should go camping!

04:44.935 --> 04:47.134
- We could share a tent!
- Yeah.

04:49.104 --> 04:51.106
Spencer, let's go take
a little break

04:51.140 --> 04:54.843
and play right over here, then we'll
go home and do some finger-painting.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.411
Right, buddy?
You and your hat.

05:02.016 --> 05:04.350
Hi, ladies.
Mind if we join you?

05:04.385 --> 05:05.618
I'm Ray Hueston

05:05.653 --> 05:08.287
and this is
my good-looking son Spencer.

05:08.322 --> 05:10.423
- Hi.
- Oh, I'm Susan.

05:10.457 --> 05:13.793
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Stephanie.

05:13.827 --> 05:15.861
Hi.

05:15.895 --> 05:18.096
Sure is a lot
of suckling going on.

05:18.130 --> 05:21.432
Usually when I walk by, there's
one or two women going at it,

05:21.466 --> 05:24.668
but eight seems like
a lot all at once.

05:24.703 --> 05:26.903
Well, we're a support group
for breastfeeding.

05:26.938 --> 05:29.504
Can I join?

05:29.539 --> 05:31.272
Um, it's kind
of a mothers' thing.

05:31.306 --> 05:34.008
Oh, a bunch of snobs, are you?

05:34.042 --> 05:37.077
Yeah, I think in the future
you'll be asking us men to join.

05:37.111 --> 05:39.913
Maybe we'll start our own
breastfeeding group.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.549
- Really?
- Definitely.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.684
You know, the male nipple
is dormant,

05:44.719 --> 05:47.554
but I think in about 750 years
we'll be able to nurse.

05:47.588 --> 05:50.523
- I speak from experience.
- Oh wow.

05:50.557 --> 05:53.026
Yeah.

06:00.701 --> 06:02.535
You hungry?

06:02.569 --> 06:04.870
I think all of this is
making him hungry.

06:04.904 --> 06:07.005
I'll just give him this,
unless--

06:07.039 --> 06:09.340
one of you will let
Spencer have a tug.

06:10.843 --> 06:13.310
I'm tapped, so--

06:13.345 --> 06:15.446
How about you?

06:15.480 --> 06:18.281
- Anything left?
- No, I'm sorry.

06:20.184 --> 06:22.018
Both-- both sides?

06:22.052 --> 06:24.787
I read a thing that a woman
columnist wrote about you one time

06:24.821 --> 06:26.755
and she said "Mitchum
was born the kind of man

06:26.790 --> 06:29.357
that does not have to seek women
because they come to him."

06:31.060 --> 06:32.927
Were that true.

06:32.961 --> 06:36.163
- <i>That's not true?</i>
- They come to me with their troubles.

06:36.197 --> 06:38.832
You know.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.467
See, now that's the way
to handle yourself on Cavett.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.636
Be cool, manly,
world-weary.

06:43.670 --> 06:47.306
You know, show a capacity for sin.
Play the rascal.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.943
Mmm. And should I cross
my legs like this,

06:50.977 --> 06:53.278
like this?
Crotch open or crotch closed?

06:53.312 --> 06:56.547
- Ray says crotch open.
- Yeah, I differ from Ray on this point.

06:56.581 --> 06:59.148
I think that the closed
crotch is more sophisticated.

06:59.182 --> 07:02.251
- It keeps them guessing.
- Okay, that does seem more natural.

07:02.286 --> 07:05.021
I really want you to hit it
out of the park tonight.

07:05.055 --> 07:06.989
With all the bookstores
closing,

07:07.023 --> 07:10.025
this could be your last
shot at literary success.

07:10.059 --> 07:13.094
- Oh God.
- So can we switch to me now?

07:13.129 --> 07:15.163
Sure, but can we study
Mitchum a little bit more?

07:15.197 --> 07:17.865
In a second.
I have a pressing headline:

07:17.899 --> 07:22.269
Emily and that crazy Bernard
went ahead and got engaged

07:22.303 --> 07:24.671
- without my blessing.
- Would you have given it?

07:24.705 --> 07:27.440
No! No, I mean, she's
gonna be hurt.

07:27.474 --> 07:30.075
He's too old and eccentric.

07:30.109 --> 07:33.210
- They do dog role-play.
- Hmmm.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.945
Luckily he's the dog,
but still.

07:35.979 --> 07:37.646
Well, have you tried
talking to her?

07:37.681 --> 07:39.681
Somehow gently expressing
your reservations?

07:39.715 --> 07:42.117
No no, I always screw up
with her.

07:42.151 --> 07:44.819
I mean, I try to improve,
but it's--

07:44.853 --> 07:46.754
it seems easier just
to make the same mistake

07:46.789 --> 07:48.523
over and over
again like an idiot.

07:48.557 --> 07:51.759
- I understand.
- You know I'm a better father to you

07:51.793 --> 07:54.862
than I am to her?
I mean, what's that about?

07:54.896 --> 07:59.165
I don't know. I think what
makes you a good father to me

07:59.199 --> 08:01.767
is-- is that you take
an interest in me,

08:01.802 --> 08:04.470
- that we talk.
- Yeah, but it's easier with you.

08:04.504 --> 08:07.005
You know, I don't care
if you fail at life.

08:07.039 --> 08:09.040
It's not a reflection on me.

08:09.074 --> 08:11.576
I take back what I just said
about you being a good father.

08:11.610 --> 08:14.912
But I still think you should talk to her.

08:18.048 --> 08:20.116
Okay, little guy,
all set there.

08:21.318 --> 08:23.352
Excuse me.

08:23.387 --> 08:25.154
Oh right, gosh.
Of course.

08:27.191 --> 08:28.758
Thank you very much.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.763
Same time next week?
Do you guys do like an email blast

08:34.797 --> 08:36.831
- as far as when you meet here?
- We don't.

08:36.865 --> 08:38.799
No. All right, all right.
Have a good one.

08:38.832 --> 08:40.567
- You too.
- Bye. All right, Spencer.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.703
Let's go, buddy.
Are you ready?

08:43.738 --> 08:46.707
Okay.

08:46.742 --> 08:49.943
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye-bye.

08:55.347 --> 08:58.682
I'm really nervous.
My tongue feels swollen.

08:58.716 --> 09:01.452
- Is that a stroke symptom?
- Stop it!

09:01.486 --> 09:04.487
Only positive thinking.
You need to do well tonight.

09:04.522 --> 09:06.789
I want a clip of this
to end up on YouTube.

09:06.823 --> 09:09.257
Could you
just look at my tongue,

09:09.292 --> 09:11.626
because it's not fitting
in my mouth.

09:11.660 --> 09:15.362
No. In 25 years I have never
looked at an author's tongue.

09:15.397 --> 09:18.064
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's not true.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.800
Tsk.
Why do all my lovers die?

09:20.834 --> 09:23.068
It's like I'm a black widow.

09:23.102 --> 09:26.472
- All your lovers die?
- No, not all.

09:26.506 --> 09:29.976
- But a lot.
- Hi, Jonathan. I can take you back to the green room now.

09:30.010 --> 09:33.678
Okay, sweetie, good luck.
I'll be rooting for you.

09:33.713 --> 09:36.281
Remember, positive thinking.

09:36.315 --> 09:38.282
Don't fail.

09:42.486 --> 09:45.487
So just be relaxed.
Dick likes it to be a conversation.

09:45.522 --> 09:47.556
- Right right.
- And tonight's theme is young writers,

09:47.590 --> 09:50.124
so you'll just talk about your book.
Oh, one thing,

09:50.158 --> 09:53.193
maintain eye contact with Dick at all times.
Don't look at the camera.

09:53.227 --> 09:55.962
Right, no camera, make eye
contact with his Dick.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.130
Sorry, just--
ahem.

09:58.164 --> 10:03.568
- And here is the green room.
- Yes, this is the green room.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.403
- Oh God.
- <i>Jonathan, this is</i> <i>Louis Greene.</i>

10:05.437 --> 10:06.904
<i>He'll be following you</i>
<i>on the show.</i>

10:06.939 --> 10:08.606
And, Louis, this is
Jonathan Ames.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.808
Hello, Jonathan.
Your most recent publication

10:10.842 --> 10:13.376
was unwarranted and ill-deserved,
did you know that?

10:14.879 --> 10:18.013
Okay. I'll be back in a few
minutes to take you to makeup.

10:18.081 --> 10:20.449
Oh sure, take your time.

10:24.019 --> 10:27.054
So I read your book,
if you can call it that.

10:27.088 --> 10:29.323
I can't believe you plagiarized

10:29.357 --> 10:31.758
my award-winning story
for "The New Yorker" magazine.

10:31.793 --> 10:34.627
What are you talking about?
We both wrote about the coke dealers.

10:34.662 --> 10:37.096
Two different takes--
like "Rashomon."

10:37.130 --> 10:39.264
That's not the "Rashomon"
I remember.

10:39.299 --> 10:41.199
Well, I suppose
you could argue that

10:41.234 --> 10:43.134
your work is
derivative of mine,

10:43.168 --> 10:45.569
but that would be like saying
a monkey with a paintbrush

10:45.603 --> 10:47.304
is a distant relation
of Van Gogh.

10:47.338 --> 10:49.706
Can you just attack me
in your mind and not out loud?

10:49.740 --> 10:51.808
I'd like to concentrate.
I need to prepare.

10:51.842 --> 10:55.144
Oh, you need to prepare?
I don't.

10:55.178 --> 10:57.512
No, you see, I was reared
on "The Dick Cavett Show."

10:57.547 --> 11:00.949
My father and I would watch every night.
He made me transcribe

11:00.983 --> 11:03.317
each episode so we could
reenact it the next day.

11:03.352 --> 11:05.920
I used to love
to be Gore vidal.

11:05.954 --> 11:07.921
Oh, but then you probably
don't know who that is.

11:07.956 --> 11:10.823
What exactly are you doing here, Louis?
<i>You</i> don't have a book out.

11:10.858 --> 11:14.059
No, I don't, but my agent says
my appearance on the show

11:14.094 --> 11:17.596
is going to create a bidding war for
my novel, "The Black Clock Of Time."

11:17.630 --> 11:20.632
- What? "The Black Cock Of Time"?
- Oh, you fiendish baboon.

11:20.666 --> 11:23.735
"The Black Clock Of Time."

11:23.769 --> 11:25.936
It's a nuclear holocaust novel

11:25.971 --> 11:27.438
set in the past.

11:27.472 --> 11:29.873
- Sorry, tricky title.
- It's not a tricky--

11:29.907 --> 11:33.109
Jonathan, I'll take you to makeup first.

11:33.143 --> 11:35.244
Thank you.

11:51.592 --> 11:54.427
Okay, keep sleeping.
Daddy needs a drink.

11:55.796 --> 11:59.965
That guy with the beard
was really odd, right?

11:59.999 --> 12:02.267
He was strange, but it
must have been a mistake.

12:02.301 --> 12:04.602
He'll come back.
He left his own son here.

12:04.637 --> 12:06.738
How do we know that's his son?

12:06.772 --> 12:08.873
I mean, people passing
by him now

12:08.907 --> 12:11.541
probably think my daughter
is his daughter.

12:11.576 --> 12:14.210
Yeah, he was a little off.

12:14.245 --> 12:17.313
- He wanted us to breastfeed the little boy.
- Okay,

12:17.347 --> 12:21.216
I just Googled "Ray Hueston"
and it led me to this.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.988
<i>Oh...</i>

12:31.259 --> 12:32.926
Oh God.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.862
Oh my God.

12:37.597 --> 12:40.598
He's a monster.

12:40.633 --> 12:44.601
Sorry it took me so long to get over here.
I was on the phone with mom

12:44.636 --> 12:47.938
and I walked east instead of west
and then north instead of South.

12:47.972 --> 12:51.841
- She says hello.
- How is your mom?

12:51.876 --> 12:53.977
She's good-- crazy, manic.

12:54.011 --> 12:56.245
Did you know that she turned
her house in Costa Rica

12:56.280 --> 12:58.247
into an eco-friendly
bed and breakfast?

12:58.281 --> 13:00.782
No, I hadn't heard about that.

13:00.817 --> 13:03.084
You know, actually

13:03.119 --> 13:06.721
my restaurant has a very
minimal eco-footprint.

13:06.755 --> 13:08.789
I only get produce from farms

13:08.823 --> 13:11.024
within 100 miles
of New York City.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.660
Why do you always have
to compete with mom?

13:13.694 --> 13:16.195
Why do you have to trump
everything she does?

13:16.230 --> 13:18.331
I'm not try--

13:18.365 --> 13:21.466
I'm sorry everything I say
seems to annoy you.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.301
So am I.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.939
Okay, so what did you
want to talk to me about?

13:28.974 --> 13:32.743
Well, I'm sure it's going
to piss you off again,

13:32.777 --> 13:36.646
but I'm just concerned
that I was such a-- a--

13:36.680 --> 13:39.482
such a failure as a father

13:39.516 --> 13:42.251
that Bernard is some kind of

13:42.285 --> 13:44.486
weird freudian substitute.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.055
Oh wow, you're really good.
That does piss me off.

13:47.089 --> 13:48.956
Wait, you know I reject Freud.

13:48.991 --> 13:51.125
Sweetheart, Freud's
very important.

13:51.159 --> 13:53.760
I can't believe you're making
my engagement about you.

13:53.795 --> 13:56.563
- He's your substitute?
- Yes!

13:56.597 --> 13:58.798
He's practically
the same age as me.

13:58.832 --> 14:00.933
He's gonna be dead in 20 years.

14:00.967 --> 14:04.136
30-- 30 years maybe.

14:04.170 --> 14:07.338
I don't care that he's old.
I'm like Woody Allen.

14:07.373 --> 14:10.708
- My heart wants him. - No no,
don't-- don't-- don't use Woody Allen.

14:10.742 --> 14:13.677
That's worse-- that's worse
than the twinkie defense.

14:13.711 --> 14:15.478
No, it's not.
Dad,

14:15.513 --> 14:18.915
this is the first time
in my life,

14:18.949 --> 14:22.484
and probably my past lives,
that I haven't felt lonely.

14:22.552 --> 14:25.954
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Dad, I love him.

14:25.988 --> 14:29.423
I wish you could respect
that-- or at least pretend to.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.358
No no, I do respect that.

14:31.393 --> 14:33.393
I always manage to say
the wrong thing.

14:33.428 --> 14:35.695
It's like I have
a limp emotionally.

14:35.730 --> 14:37.830
- Come here, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

14:37.865 --> 14:39.765
- I love you.
- I love you.

14:42.735 --> 14:45.270
- I love you Mowell--n that.
- See, wa! Competitive.

14:45.304 --> 14:47.238
Be sure and pick up
Danny Woodside's new book.

14:47.272 --> 14:51.508
It's called "Splitsies, A child's
perspective on divorce."

14:51.576 --> 14:54.010
- Thank you, Dick.
- Good to see you.

14:59.249 --> 15:01.850
<i>Now our next young
writer</i> <i>has just come out</i>

15:01.885 --> 15:05.053
with a new book
of mystery stories,

15:05.088 --> 15:08.423
and it is called
"the blonde in the woods."

15:08.458 --> 15:11.427
So please welcome
Jonathan-- uh, Ames.

15:11.461 --> 15:12.895
Jonathan Ames.

15:15.865 --> 15:17.598
<i>Jonathan.</i>

15:18.767 --> 15:20.867
Oooh. Aha ha.

15:21.769 --> 15:22.869
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:22.903 --> 15:25.336
We don't require
dramatic entrances.

15:25.371 --> 15:27.505
- Good one, Dick.
- <i>Sorry, the glasses--</i> <i>I couldn't see.</i>

15:27.539 --> 15:30.407
By the way, it's not terribly
wise to wear sunglasses

15:30.441 --> 15:33.643
<i>on television.</i> <i>Do you think
maybe</i> <i>you could do without them?</i>

15:33.677 --> 15:36.111
- Oh yes, sorry.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15:36.146 --> 15:40.715
Now as for your
latest escapade--

15:42.384 --> 15:44.752
Jonathan, we don't have
smoking on television.

15:44.786 --> 15:47.555
- Right.
- You see, we're in New York City

15:47.589 --> 15:49.790
and you can't even smoke
in your own apartment now.

15:49.825 --> 15:53.627
Sorry, I was trying to
channel Robert Mitchum.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.530
Oh, this is too delicious.
He's like a mental pygmy.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.332
Oh, I love it, I love it,
I love it.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.321
Well, Jonathan, you not only
write mysteries, you solve them.

16:24.355 --> 16:26.689
<i>Are you working</i>
<i>on a case right now?</i>

16:26.724 --> 16:28.725
My wife hasn't
hired you, has she?

16:28.759 --> 16:31.794
Um, I'm actually my own client
at the moment.

16:31.828 --> 16:33.829
I'm searching
for my biological father.

16:33.863 --> 16:35.798
Wow, that's quite a case.

16:35.832 --> 16:39.468
Uh, damn, we have to stop right
now for some commercials.

16:39.502 --> 16:42.037
We'd love it if you
could stay and maybe

16:42.072 --> 16:44.640
talk some more about
all this after the break.

16:44.674 --> 16:46.975
- Sure, really?
- <i>Okay.</i>

16:47.009 --> 16:50.612
We'll be back then, after this
break, with Jonathan Ames.

16:50.646 --> 16:52.280
Don't go away.

16:52.314 --> 16:55.616
- Okay.
- Is everything going okay, Dick?

16:55.651 --> 16:58.052
Yeah, good. Look, listen,
let's cancel the next guest.

16:58.087 --> 17:00.988
This father stuff is good.
We're in "Oprah" territory.

17:01.022 --> 17:03.156
All right, you got it.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.096
"What do I think about the state
of American culture? Well, Dick,"

17:10.130 --> 17:13.299
I think we could make penicillin
out of American culture.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.267
I mean, look at Jonathan Ames.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.035
"Thank you. I'm glad the
audience found that amusing."

17:18.069 --> 17:20.637
Perfect.

17:20.671 --> 17:22.505
Um, Mr. Greene?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.607
Oh hi, Liz.
Oh, is this it?

17:24.642 --> 17:26.576
Am I going on?
How do I look?

17:26.609 --> 17:29.279
You know, actually we're gonna
have to bump you from the show.

17:29.313 --> 17:32.314
These things happen. Mr.
Cavett wants to extend the segment with Mr. Ames.

17:32.349 --> 17:34.416
With-- with Jonathan?

17:34.450 --> 17:36.817
You don't understand,

17:36.852 --> 17:39.086
<i>I</i> have been preparing
my whole life

17:39.120 --> 17:41.421
to intellectually engage
with Dick Cavett,

17:41.455 --> 17:44.256
- not Jonathan Ames.
- There's nothing I can do.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.124
No, please listen.

17:46.159 --> 17:49.828
My father is watching, okay?
This is everything to us.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.362
I mean, they even took
daddy off his thorazine

17:52.397 --> 17:54.397
just for tonight
so he could watch, so--

17:54.432 --> 17:56.232
I'm so sorry, Mr. Greene.

17:57.668 --> 17:59.602
Just put me on
for a couple of seconds.

17:59.636 --> 18:01.771
Just a few seconds.
Okay, I'll level with you.

18:01.805 --> 18:05.373
I have crippling debt and my
agent says that my novel,

18:05.408 --> 18:07.542
"the black clock of time,"
will not sell

18:07.576 --> 18:10.677
- unless I am on the show.
- "The Big Black Cock Of Time"?

18:10.711 --> 18:14.613
No, you subnormal illiterate.

18:14.647 --> 18:17.981
"The Black Clock <i>Of Time."</i>

18:18.016 --> 18:20.784
It isn't hard. I didn't say "big.
" Why would you say that?

18:20.818 --> 18:23.452
- What's wrong with you?
- You're bumped, Mr. Greene!

18:24.888 --> 18:27.055
<i>No, please, Liz.</i>

18:32.028 --> 18:35.430
He's some kind
of sick cartoonist.

18:35.464 --> 18:40.366
All he draws are penises
and he has my little girl.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.101
Can you describe the penises?

18:42.135 --> 18:44.403
B-big.

18:44.437 --> 18:47.472
Do you have a Nemesis,

18:47.506 --> 18:49.940
the way Sherlock Holmes
had Professor Moriarty?

18:49.975 --> 18:53.477
Well, I don't want to speak
poorly of him on air,

18:53.511 --> 18:55.779
<i>but my Nemesis was going</i>
<i>to be your next guest</i>

18:55.813 --> 18:57.446
- Logr- what?

18:57.481 --> 19:00.148
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>But I do feel bad for him.</i>

19:00.183 --> 19:03.317
I was told once that his
father, a child psychologist,

19:03.352 --> 19:06.086
- experimented on him.
- Experimented on him?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.788
- <i>What kind of experiments?</i>
- Made him sleep in a box,

19:08.823 --> 19:12.758
sensory deprivation, transcription
of television shows--

19:12.792 --> 19:15.660
- <i>that sort of thing.</i>
- Whew, that's terrible.

19:15.695 --> 19:17.796
The father sounds like
the poor man's b.F. Skinner.

19:17.830 --> 19:19.698
What a kook.

19:19.732 --> 19:21.933
This must stop.

19:24.003 --> 19:27.572
Hi. 52nd, between ninth
and 10th, please.

19:27.607 --> 19:30.441
"The Cavett show."

19:30.476 --> 19:33.010
<i>Hi, I'm parks commissioner</i>
<i>Adrian Benepe,</i>

19:33.044 --> 19:34.612

<i>a program that offers...</i>

19:34.646 --> 19:36.647
How do you t--
how do you turn--

19:36.681 --> 19:40.116
<i>This is an urgent alert from</i>
<i>the New York Police Department.</i>

19:40.151 --> 19:43.786
- Ray? Oh my God. - <i>If you have any
information</i> <i>pertaining to this matter...</i>

19:43.821 --> 19:45.821
<i>Oh, Ray.</i>

19:47.223 --> 19:49.323
Excuse me,
can I borrow your phone?

19:49.357 --> 19:51.791
I lost mine in a mailbox.

19:51.826 --> 19:53.993
I have to call my friend.
He's in trouble.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.194
- Okay.
- Thank you.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.129
But please don't call Pakistan.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.331
The CIA doesn't like it
when I do that.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.332
917...

20:02.367 --> 20:04.067
917-- oh, who am I kidding?

20:04.101 --> 20:07.236
My mind is shot. I haven't
memorized a phone number in years.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.705
Could you hurry up, please?

20:09.739 --> 20:11.206
Okay.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.373
Well, I don't have
a lot of clues,

20:13.408 --> 20:15.809
<i>but even if I find</i>
<i>my biological dad,</i>

20:15.843 --> 20:18.778
<i>I do want to make it clear</i>
<i>that my dad who raised me</i>

20:18.813 --> 20:21.582
- <i>was a wonderful father...</i>
- Eh, excuse me.

20:21.616 --> 20:24.350
- Where is the lever that controls the curtain, please?
- Shh shh shh.

20:24.385 --> 20:26.751
<i>Especially since</i> <i>he's watching.</i>

20:26.786 --> 20:28.352
<i>I'm glad to hear</i> <i>he's watching.</i>

20:28.386 --> 20:30.220
<i>We could use the ratings.</i>

20:30.254 --> 20:32.789
- <i>My mom's also watching.</i>
- <i>Okay then.</i>

20:32.823 --> 20:35.125
<i>All the better.</i>
<i>You know, we're almost funny.</i>

20:35.159 --> 20:38.127
- <i>We should have a comedy show.</i>
- <i>You're funny. I'm just--</i>

20:38.161 --> 20:41.497
<i>you know, with all</i> <i>that we've talked
about</i> <i>I just can't help thinking</i>

20:41.531 --> 20:44.199
<i>that not knowing who</i>
<i>your biological father is</i>

20:44.233 --> 20:47.235
must be a pretty dark place.

20:47.269 --> 20:50.670
It is dark,
but my spirits are good.

20:50.704 --> 20:52.872
- Hmm.
- I'm kind of an upbeat Hamlet.

20:52.906 --> 20:56.508
- <i>Upbeat Hamlet?</i>
- What does he know about Hamlet, that idiot?!

20:56.542 --> 20:58.776
<i>"To be or not to be."</i>

20:58.811 --> 21:02.347
Mr. Cavett, I know I'm supposed to
look you in the eye at all times,

21:02.381 --> 21:04.849
but could I speak directly
to the audience at home?

21:04.883 --> 21:07.718
Well, this is unusual,
but so are you.

21:07.752 --> 21:09.686
And so am I.
Yeah sure, go ahead.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.387
Thank you.

21:11.421 --> 21:12.755
Hello.

21:12.789 --> 21:14.756
If anyone knows anything

21:14.791 --> 21:17.159
about the Hudson sperm bank
that went up in flames

21:17.194 --> 21:19.194
in fair lawn,
new Jersey, in 1981,

21:19.229 --> 21:23.330
- <i>please lp me...</i>
- Always with the sentimental claptrap!

21:23.365 --> 21:25.632
Look out, Dick!

21:29.002 --> 21:30.469
Oh dear lord,
that's not the curtain.

21:30.503 --> 21:32.371
Oh, fuckity.

21:35.709 --> 21:38.777
- Who is that?
- That's my moriarty.

21:38.811 --> 21:41.813
Mr. Cavett, I was just trying
to bring down the curtain.

21:41.848 --> 21:43.181
Jonathan, Jonathan.

21:43.216 --> 21:46.584
We have to call Ray.
There's been an emergency.

21:46.618 --> 21:48.586
Hey, Dick.
George Christopher.

21:48.620 --> 21:50.488
We had lunch together in 1979

21:50.523 --> 21:52.457
- with Norman mailer.
- Whatever.

21:52.491 --> 21:53.691

God!

22:22.352 --> 22:24.720
Who are you
and where is Spencer?

22:38.866 --> 22:41.201
- And up.
- Be careful. This is a...

22:41.236 --> 22:43.937
- Still not picking up.
- Maybe he's in hiding.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.772
I never would have thought
he'd kidnap a child.

22:46.807 --> 22:48.574
Oh, Mr. Cavett.

22:48.608 --> 22:50.542
Thank you so much
for having me on your show.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.478
- I'm sorry about--
- <i>Oh, nothing to be sorry about.</i>

22:53.513 --> 22:55.947
This was fantastic tv.

22:55.981 --> 22:59.483
And, my lad, you are going
to sell a shitload of books.

22:59.518 --> 23:03.320
- Thank you.
- Oh, good luck on your dad.

23:03.354 --> 23:06.122
Get me down, you oxen.

23:06.156 --> 23:08.524
What do I pay my taxes for?

23:08.558 --> 23:10.892
- Here, let me go around.
- Whoa, easy easy.

23:10.927 --> 23:13.194
I had the chicken Kiev
at the Russian tea room.

23:13.229 --> 23:14.162
So-- oh.

23:20.033 --> 23:22.167
Ray Hueston?
You're free to go.

23:22.202 --> 23:24.936
<i>You're hurting me.</i> <i>Easy.</i>

23:26.072 --> 23:28.373
Ray?
Ray, thank God you're here.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.974
Louis?

23:30.008 --> 23:31.108
- Help me.
- Get in there.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.843
The sandwiches aren't half bad!

23:38.749 --> 23:41.016
Hi.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.788
Hi.

23:46.823 --> 23:49.057
Hi.

23:49.091 --> 23:50.691
Is Spencer all right?

23:50.726 --> 23:53.127
Yes, he's with Renee
in Ditmas park.

23:53.161 --> 23:55.762
Everyone realizes
it was a big mistake,

23:55.797 --> 23:58.998
- but, Ray--
- What?

23:59.032 --> 24:02.368
Renee's worried about you
being alone with Spencer.

24:02.402 --> 24:05.003
She wants to reconsider
the arrangement.

24:05.037 --> 24:08.138
Oh God.

24:08.173 --> 24:10.607
- I'm sorry, Ray.
- I'm sure she'll come around.

24:10.641 --> 24:14.744
I once left Emily locked in a
car when she was five years old

24:14.778 --> 24:17.612
and her mom got over it.
We didn't speak for a year,

24:17.647 --> 24:20.047
but...

24:22.618 --> 24:26.621
I'm sorry to hear that. Of course I'll
write a letter to your parole officer.

24:26.656 --> 24:29.124
- Thank you, <i>papi.</i>
- It's the least I can do.

24:29.158 --> 24:31.559
Oh, thank you, Jose.

24:31.593 --> 24:33.627
They took my cravat, you know?

24:33.662 --> 24:36.163
- The navy blue one.
- Oh.
