Radical!

00:34.130 --> 00:35.297
Whoa! What?

00:35.365 --> 00:37.899
Oh, yeah! Nice!

00:37.967 --> 00:39.868
Yeah!

00:43.673 --> 00:45.907
- Hi, there, Rosa.
- Hey, there, Josh.

00:45.975 --> 00:48.510
Uh, I was wondering if you might like

00:48.578 --> 00:49.745
to have lunch with me today.

00:49.812 --> 00:51.313
Oh, I'd love to...

00:51.381 --> 00:52.848
but I'm going to have
to take a rain check

00:52.915 --> 00:55.283
because I'm having lunch
with my boyfriend.

00:55.351 --> 00:57.352
How was your day?

00:57.420 --> 00:59.421
It sucked.

01:25.982 --> 01:27.482
Mmm.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.951
Oh! What is that horrible smell?

01:30.019 --> 01:33.622
It could be... I just
microwaved some curry I cooked.

01:33.689 --> 01:35.457
Please don't ever bring
your curry here again.

01:35.525 --> 01:36.591
Sorry, Mr. Powell.

01:39.429 --> 01:41.463
Look, I know he's technically our boss,

01:41.531 --> 01:45.000
but I think you should just...
curry on, my friend.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.268
Hey, ah? Thank you very much.

01:46.335 --> 01:47.502
Those are words to live by.

01:48.871 --> 01:50.539
Yeah, I think I might have to curry on.

01:50.606 --> 01:52.707
Oh, yeah. Ooh! Eggplant.

01:52.775 --> 01:53.942
- Mm-hmm.
- Nicely done, sir.

01:54.010 --> 01:55.510
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:55.578 --> 01:57.112
I used to always put
eggplant in my curry.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.380
Cool. Wait, used to?

01:58.448 --> 02:00.048
- Mm-hmm.
- Why? What happened?

02:00.116 --> 02:02.717
No, I just, uh... My boyfriend
doesn't like curry,

02:02.785 --> 02:06.688
so I don't really make it anymore.

02:06.756 --> 02:07.956
<i>It's killing me, man.</i>

02:08.024 --> 02:09.890
I am so into this girl,

02:09.959 --> 02:11.860
and we're... we're... We're
perfect for each other,

02:11.928 --> 02:15.564
but as long as her stupid boring
boyfriend is in the picture,

02:15.631 --> 02:17.332
there... there's nothing
I can do about it.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.367
Dude, there's always
something you can do.

02:19.435 --> 02:21.069
Like what? I'm not gonna
try and steal her.

02:21.137 --> 02:22.637
That's not what I'm saying.

02:22.705 --> 02:24.840
All I'm saying is raise
your profile a little bit.

02:24.907 --> 02:27.342
Show her that, should she
ever want to make a change,

02:27.410 --> 02:30.712
you are a strong, viable
candidate for a new boyfriend.

02:30.780 --> 02:31.980
Huh.

02:32.048 --> 02:34.616
So I wouldn't be actively...

02:34.684 --> 02:36.718
- Yep!
- I... I'd just be sort of...

02:36.786 --> 02:39.488
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

02:39.555 --> 02:40.922
Michael, that's very interesting.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.624
Hey, there Rosa; I thought these

02:42.692 --> 02:44.726
might come in handy, fresh
from the supply room.

02:44.794 --> 02:46.161
Oh, thanks, Josh. That's so sweet.

02:46.229 --> 02:47.562
Hey, no problem.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.164
- Oh, Josh.
- Can we get a comment?

02:49.232 --> 02:51.299
Do you have a comment for News Wire?
Listen.

02:51.367 --> 02:53.735
We've noticed you've done a lot
of nice things for Rosa lately.

02:53.803 --> 02:55.070
Is there any truth to the rumors

02:55.138 --> 02:56.505
that you're running for boyfriend?

02:56.572 --> 02:57.839
I don't know where you heard that.

02:57.907 --> 02:59.407
I am more than proud

02:59.475 --> 03:01.109
of my current position as Rosa's friend.

03:01.177 --> 03:03.445
Rosa already has a boyfriend,
which we all know.

03:03.513 --> 03:05.413
Uh, do I agree with all of his policies?

03:05.481 --> 03:06.681
Of course not.

03:06.749 --> 03:08.450
His no-curry policy,

03:08.518 --> 03:09.851
for instance, is not one I support.

03:09.919 --> 03:12.487
So, as Rosa's boyfriend, you'd eat curry?

03:12.555 --> 03:14.356
I would, indeed, but I'm
not here to comment

03:14.423 --> 03:16.191
on what might happen in the future.

03:16.259 --> 03:18.927
My focus right now is on
being Rosa's friend, period.

03:18.995 --> 03:21.530
Speaking of which, I should
probably get back to work.

03:21.597 --> 03:24.032
I have some funny YouTube
clips to send her over Gchat.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.300
Wait! One more question, Josh!

03:26.636 --> 03:28.436
I'm sorry, folks.

03:28.504 --> 03:31.907
That's all the time Josh has.
He is a very busy friend.

03:33.509 --> 03:34.743
Ahh!

03:34.810 --> 03:36.378
All right, guys. This is great.

03:36.445 --> 03:38.446
We have to do this again soon.

03:38.514 --> 03:40.048
- Josh! Josh!
- One at a time, one at a time!

03:40.116 --> 03:41.816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. One at a time!

03:41.884 --> 03:43.585
- Guys!
- One... one at a time.

03:43.653 --> 03:45.587
One at a time. Uh, Janet.

03:45.655 --> 03:47.856
Josh, are you trying to win
favor with Rosa's friends

03:47.924 --> 03:49.991
so they'll support you
in a run for boyfriend?

03:50.059 --> 03:52.060
No, I... I... That's ridiculous.

03:52.128 --> 03:53.995
As Rosa's friend, I merely like to have

03:54.063 --> 03:57.599
the occasional sit-down with
other friends of Rosa's,

03:57.667 --> 03:59.868
uh, so that I can stay
abreast of the issues

03:59.936 --> 04:01.136
that are important to them.

04:01.204 --> 04:02.771
For instance, I just found out about

04:02.838 --> 04:06.074
some great spots to get salad
and about a play that has,

04:06.142 --> 04:07.642
like, a deaf guy in it or something.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.477
Did the topic of her boyfriend come up?

04:09.545 --> 04:11.079
Oh, Steve. You're killing me.

04:11.147 --> 04:12.347
I won't lie.

04:12.415 --> 04:14.382
They... they expressed some concern

04:14.450 --> 04:16.651
that he doesn't hang out with
them as much as they would like.

04:16.719 --> 04:18.086
Uh, which is a shame.

04:18.154 --> 04:19.353
These are great people

04:19.422 --> 04:21.156
with beautiful stories and unique voices

04:21.224 --> 04:23.024
that deserved to be heard.

04:23.092 --> 04:25.026
All right, that's it, folks.
Thanks for your time.

04:25.094 --> 04:26.695
- Just one more...
- Dude, check the numbers.

04:26.762 --> 04:28.997
Your approval rating with Rosa is way up!

04:29.065 --> 04:31.600
Now is the time to pull out the
stops and go at this hard.

04:31.667 --> 04:32.867
What does that mean?

04:32.935 --> 04:34.769
Got to go negative.

04:39.976 --> 04:42.344
Hey, uh... you all good?

04:42.411 --> 04:44.112
Um...

04:44.180 --> 04:46.147
Yeah. I just...

04:46.215 --> 04:48.116
I wanted to try this new
Mongolian restaurant...

04:48.184 --> 04:49.751
- Ooh!
- With my boyfriend.

04:49.819 --> 04:51.886
And I don't want to be obnoxious
and complain about it,

04:51.954 --> 04:53.722
'cause you know he has all
of those food things,

04:53.789 --> 04:56.191
but we never get to go
anywhere new, and it's just...

04:56.259 --> 04:59.294
It's starting to get really...
annoying, and...

04:59.362 --> 05:01.529
Ugh, God! So sorry.

05:01.597 --> 05:03.665
You're so not into this. It's so fine.

05:03.733 --> 05:04.866
- No, I...
- It's not a big deal.

05:04.934 --> 05:06.901
You don't have to listen to this.

05:06.969 --> 05:09.104
No, it is; it's about... I would
assume that's got to be...

05:09.171 --> 05:10.872
Eventually got to get pretty frustrating.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.974
You know, there's just
so much he doesn't eat.

05:13.042 --> 05:15.110
Well, I just... I know you
love trying every different

05:15.177 --> 05:16.544
kind of food, just like I love trying

05:16.612 --> 05:17.946
every different kind of food.

05:18.014 --> 05:19.681
So I can only imagine
what that would be like.

05:19.749 --> 05:21.349
It's kind of like, how
many nights in a row

05:21.417 --> 05:23.918
can you have white rice and
steamed vegetables? Ugh!

05:23.986 --> 05:25.620
Uh, no nights, no nights in a row,

05:25.688 --> 05:26.821
- if you ask me.
- Yeah!

05:26.889 --> 05:28.223
Yeah, no nights.

05:28.291 --> 05:29.591
No nights.

05:35.398 --> 05:37.465
<i>The Dinnergate scandal rages on</i>

<i>You heard the man. Back on

06:50.406 --> 06:52.006
It's morning in America!

06:58.852 --> 06:59.952
Hey, Rosa.

07:01.055 --> 07:02.422
Hey, Rosa.

07:02.489 --> 07:06.192
So... you guys, uh, game for some games?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.862
No, I...

07:08.929 --> 07:09.964
Oh!

07:10.136 --> 07:11.870
All right. Where do we put our bazaar?

07:11.938 --> 07:14.606
I suspect we should put our
bazaar relatively close

07:14.674 --> 07:16.875
to, say, the caravan, 'cause
that way we can trade

07:16.943 --> 07:19.344
goats for resources because
you and I are very goat-rich.

07:19.412 --> 07:20.879
So I'm glad I'm on your team.

07:20.947 --> 07:22.414
- And I think you are.
- All the strategy!

07:22.482 --> 07:23.849
That's exactly right.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.385
Rosa, guess who decided to show up.

07:26.452 --> 07:29.421
Oh, my God! Yes, he came!

07:31.157 --> 07:32.724
Holy shit!

07:36.596 --> 07:37.963
Hey, hey!

07:38.031 --> 07:39.998
Hey!

07:40.066 --> 07:43.168
Is she... that's, uh...
Is that Jesus Christ?

07:43.236 --> 07:45.270
They met at Dave and Buster's.
He's really cool.

07:45.338 --> 07:47.806
- What's going on?
- It's been too long.

07:47.874 --> 07:50.175
I'm sorry it's been a while.
It's been crazy at work!

07:50.243 --> 07:51.810
With the lepers?

07:51.878 --> 07:53.979
The lepers, you know,
other stuff, you know.

07:54.047 --> 07:55.414
- They're really...
- He cures lepers.

07:55.481 --> 07:56.748
- Oh, good. Good.
- Oh, hi!

07:56.816 --> 07:58.650
- Whoa! You must be Josh!
- Yeah.

07:58.718 --> 08:00.919
Yeah, yeah, that's me, hi.
It's so good to meet you, man.

08:00.987 --> 08:02.354
- I'm Jesus.
- Yeah, I know.

08:02.422 --> 08:04.690
I'm... yeah, very familiar with you.

08:04.757 --> 08:06.158
Well, I'm very familiar with you.

08:06.225 --> 08:07.893
- What?
- You are famous in this house.

08:07.961 --> 08:09.227
You're office manager, correct?

08:09.295 --> 08:10.762
I mean, you're Jesus Christ.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.130
- Oh, come on.
- So you're... you're...

08:12.198 --> 08:14.833
You're the son of God... and God.

08:14.901 --> 08:16.101
It's so... It's so complicated.

08:16.169 --> 08:17.369
- Yeah.
- It took me a while to...

08:17.437 --> 08:18.870
I don't even understand it.

08:18.938 --> 08:20.739
- Yeah, right.
- When it was explained to me,

08:20.807 --> 08:23.342
I thought, "Okay, so I'm the
son of God and I'm... and... "

08:23.409 --> 08:25.677
at this point I'm just like,
show me where to go...

08:25.745 --> 08:27.713
and I'll do my job, and out I go.

08:27.780 --> 08:29.281
Believe me, I'm going to... game night?

08:29.349 --> 08:31.183
What are we doing here? I
was thinking on the way,

08:31.250 --> 08:32.583
- what about "Celebrity"?
- Well, we...

08:34.320 --> 08:35.921
- You are great!
- That's perfect.

08:35.989 --> 08:37.356
We had... no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:37.423 --> 08:38.690
Come on! You did pretty well.

08:38.758 --> 08:40.525
- And you did pretty well.
- No, I didn't.

08:40.592 --> 08:42.828
So why don't we do that. Write
down names of celebrities.

08:42.895 --> 08:44.630
Hey, Josh. Are you coming?

08:44.697 --> 08:47.366
Uh... I don't... I don't
know what "Celebrity" is.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.067
- You can be with us.
- I don't have to.

08:49.135 --> 08:50.969
Uh, you know what? I'll just...
I'll just, uh...

08:51.037 --> 08:52.938
Jesus, Rosa and Josh, we're
gonna be the dream team,

08:53.006 --> 08:54.272
and we're gonna kill these guys.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.707
- JJR.
- Yeah, because you're...

08:55.775 --> 08:58.377
- JJR, come on!
- Yeah, good, yeah, thanks.

08:58.444 --> 09:00.912
All right, guys. Nothing
too obscure, okay?

09:03.416 --> 09:05.183
- Uh... Elvis.
- Elvis Presley.

09:05.251 --> 09:06.852
- Yeah!
- Doing great, Josh.

09:06.919 --> 09:09.521
Thanks. Uh...

09:09.589 --> 09:11.089
Oh.

09:11.157 --> 09:12.357
- Oh, Jesus!
- You...

09:12.425 --> 09:13.859
- Oh!
- Who did that?

09:13.926 --> 09:15.060
- Nate?
- Maybe.

09:15.128 --> 09:16.795
That's embarrassing for me.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.330
- I had to.
- It puts me on the spot.

09:18.398 --> 09:19.965
I'm not really mad, but just... no more.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.199
No more from now on.

09:25.772 --> 09:27.739
You're, uh, uh, on a wave?

09:27.807 --> 09:29.174
Are you... California! Surfer!

09:29.242 --> 09:31.143
A famous surfer! Do I
know any famous surfers?

09:31.210 --> 09:33.111
- I think we should pass.
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:33.179 --> 09:34.780
I think we should pass.
Just pick another.

09:34.847 --> 09:36.148
All right, is it a... A lady surfer!

09:36.215 --> 09:37.683
What? Oh, who are the female surfers?

09:37.750 --> 09:39.418
Uh, uh, Michelle Rodriguez. "Blue Crush!"

09:39.485 --> 09:40.786
Michelle... Mm... "Blue Crush!"

09:40.853 --> 09:42.020
- Time!
- We are...

09:42.088 --> 09:44.089
It was... It was Keanu Reeves.

09:44.157 --> 09:45.357
Keanu Reeves, Keanu Reeves!

09:45.425 --> 09:46.758
Oh! You should have done "Matrix!"

09:46.826 --> 09:48.427
- The whoa!
- No, he was, you know,

09:48.494 --> 09:50.362
he was doing the surfing,
"Point Break," right?

09:50.430 --> 09:51.930
- Oh!
- You do "The Matrix."

09:51.998 --> 09:53.699
That's... that's on me. That's on me.

09:53.766 --> 09:55.934
So speaking of Keanu Reeves,
has anyone seen "John Wick?"

09:56.002 --> 09:57.636
- Did you ever seen "John Wick?"
- Oh, no!

09:57.704 --> 09:59.438
- No, not yet.
- Favorite movie of last year.

09:59.505 --> 10:01.039
- Oh, cool.
- The director did stunt work

10:01.107 --> 10:02.474
- for 20 years.
- Oh, cool.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.543
So the action is still-
Josh, you would...

10:04.610 --> 10:05.977
As a matter of fact...

10:06.045 --> 10:08.413
What? What?

10:08.481 --> 10:10.148
- Whoa!
- I Torrented it, and...

10:10.216 --> 10:12.250
Which is fine because I do get
the word out on this one.

10:12.318 --> 10:13.618
- Please check it out and...
- Wow!

10:13.686 --> 10:15.554
You don't have to give this to me.

10:15.621 --> 10:17.789
Watch it and then call me, and
we're gonna talk about it.

10:17.857 --> 10:19.124
- Thank you.
- I'm serious.

10:19.192 --> 10:20.959
I'm not doing, like, a
fake, like, "Call me."

10:21.027 --> 10:23.261
- I mean, saying, "Call me."
- Oh, yeah.

10:23.329 --> 10:25.097
'Cause I think you, Josh,
are going to like it

10:25.164 --> 10:26.565
because I think we have similar taste.

10:26.632 --> 10:28.266
Oh, cool.

10:40.446 --> 10:41.580
Time.

10:41.647 --> 10:43.582
Time, time!

10:43.649 --> 10:45.984
- You lose.
- It's... it's long enough.

10:46.052 --> 10:48.153
So, uh, if you guys win this round,

10:48.221 --> 10:49.888
we're going to play one
more game and then...

10:49.956 --> 10:52.357
Anybody hungry, by chance?

10:52.425 --> 10:53.658
Oh, uh, I forgot.

10:53.726 --> 10:56.361
Josh made something. Chef.

10:56.429 --> 10:58.096
What... what is it?

10:58.164 --> 11:01.800
It is Josh's famous
Mongolian curry, in fact.

11:01.868 --> 11:03.268
Yeah, I know it's a bit exotic.

11:03.336 --> 11:05.704
It may not be to everyone's taste.

11:05.772 --> 11:08.540
It's definitely... it's not
for the unadventurous.

11:08.608 --> 11:11.042
Mmm, Josh!

11:11.110 --> 11:12.310
Is that... That's eggplant.

11:12.378 --> 11:13.879
Mm-hmm. It's so good.

11:13.946 --> 11:16.381
- Very informed palate.
- Is this guy single?

11:16.449 --> 11:17.949
She asked if you were single.

11:18.017 --> 11:19.217
Did you hear her?

11:19.285 --> 11:21.319
Guilty as charged.

11:21.387 --> 11:22.921
Jesus, would you... Would you like some?

11:22.989 --> 11:24.890
No, no, no, no, no. I'm very...

11:24.957 --> 11:27.826
- You have to.
- I'm very full, very full.

11:27.894 --> 11:30.295
Like I said, it's exotic. I
know it's a big ask, so.

11:30.363 --> 11:31.630
Let me... I... I'll try...

11:31.697 --> 11:33.799
Quick question... And
this is so annoying...

11:33.866 --> 11:35.901
Is it gluten-free?

11:35.968 --> 11:37.235
Yeah, I think so.

11:37.303 --> 11:38.503
You think so or you know so?

11:39.972 --> 11:41.173
I know so.

11:42.742 --> 11:45.277
Josh... you know so?

11:47.380 --> 11:49.281
Yeah, yeah, I know so.

11:49.348 --> 11:50.582
I know so.

11:50.650 --> 11:52.083
- What?
- I know so.

11:52.151 --> 11:53.285
Okay. You got clearance.

11:53.352 --> 11:55.153
That's all I needed to know.

11:55.221 --> 11:57.155
Even when I'm full, I don't
mind having a little bit

11:57.223 --> 11:59.691
of something that's, um...
of the right flavor.

11:59.759 --> 12:01.326
- Yeah.
- So why not?

12:01.394 --> 12:04.095
There's plenty more where it came from.

12:04.163 --> 12:05.797
Josh...

12:05.865 --> 12:07.566
- Best thing I've ever had.
- Hey, come on, man.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.201
No, no, Josh. I'm not kidding.

12:09.268 --> 12:10.902
- Best thing I've ever had.
- He doesn't lie.

12:10.970 --> 12:12.204
- The taste.
- Thanks.

12:12.271 --> 12:14.673
- And the texture...
- Good.

12:16.209 --> 12:19.144
The texture is...

12:19.212 --> 12:21.146
Babe!

12:21.214 --> 12:22.547
Babe, look at me.

12:22.615 --> 12:23.949
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God.

12:24.016 --> 12:25.250
Where is it, babe? Point to it.

12:25.318 --> 12:27.052
Where is it right now? Oh, my God.

12:27.119 --> 12:29.020
I'll get the antacids.

12:29.088 --> 12:31.590
- I... what... what? What?
- Move the bowl.

12:31.657 --> 12:33.058
- Ow!
- What?

12:33.125 --> 12:34.326
- The pain.
- The pain?

12:34.393 --> 12:36.394
What... what... What is happening?

12:40.733 --> 12:41.867
What...

12:46.906 --> 12:48.874
Josh...

12:48.941 --> 12:50.742
you betrayed me.

12:52.144 --> 12:53.345
- I'm sorry.
- Ow!

12:53.412 --> 12:55.480
Ah!

12:55.548 --> 12:57.682
Ow!

12:57.750 --> 12:59.284
We should probably be going.

12:59.352 --> 13:00.552
Okay. I'm so sorry.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.720
You did nothing wrong.

13:01.787 --> 13:03.121
It was... it's an accident.

13:05.391 --> 13:07.292
Um...

13:07.360 --> 13:09.427
What... what exactly is wrong with him?

13:09.495 --> 13:11.029
He's got flash diarrhea, Josh,

13:11.097 --> 13:12.330
and it's extremely painful.

13:12.398 --> 13:14.466
Ah! Oh!

13:14.533 --> 13:16.334
Josh, you told him the
curry was gluten-free.

13:16.402 --> 13:18.503
I know, I guess... I guess I wasn't sure.

13:18.571 --> 13:21.072
If you weren't sure,
then why did you say...

13:21.140 --> 13:22.307
you were sure?

13:22.375 --> 13:25.510
I just thought he was being... picky.

13:25.578 --> 13:27.646
Oh!

13:27.713 --> 13:28.880
Do you hear him? He's in pain.

13:30.683 --> 13:31.883
- Is that Aramaic?
- Yes.

13:37.189 --> 13:38.523
See, he's picky because he has to be.

13:38.591 --> 13:40.025
He has Celiac.

13:40.092 --> 13:41.426
That's why he's so thin.

13:41.494 --> 13:44.596
Oh, I am... I am... so sorry!

13:44.664 --> 13:46.364
- R-Rosa.
- Yeah, babe?

13:46.432 --> 13:47.599
It's not his fault.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.833
What do you mean?

13:49.969 --> 13:51.436
I just remembered.

13:51.504 --> 13:54.072
I had a whole basket of pita at lunch.

13:54.140 --> 13:55.473
Why would you do that?

13:55.541 --> 13:57.042
I don't even know what I was thinking.

13:57.109 --> 13:59.110
It was not the curry at all.
Don't worry about that.

13:59.178 --> 14:00.445
Josh, I'm so sorry; I didn't mean

14:00.513 --> 14:01.680
to come down on you like that.

14:01.747 --> 14:03.214
I just... I was really worried about him.

14:03.282 --> 14:04.549
No, of course, I get it.

14:04.617 --> 14:05.784
Totally, totally fine.

14:05.851 --> 14:07.152
I would do the same thing.

14:07.219 --> 14:08.320
Okay. I'm so...

14:08.387 --> 14:09.654
Um, do me a favor?

14:09.722 --> 14:11.623
Um, I could use some candles, maybe?

14:11.691 --> 14:13.024
- Yeah.
- Um, some air fresheners...

14:13.092 --> 14:14.326
- Okay.
- In the closet.

14:14.393 --> 14:15.927
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

14:17.330 --> 14:18.463
- Yeah.
- Well...

14:18.531 --> 14:20.532
That was a good... Good game night, huh?

14:20.599 --> 14:23.635
Yeah, I would say. Uh, you know, uh...

14:23.703 --> 14:26.771
Josh, I know that it was the curry.

14:26.839 --> 14:28.773
Oh... shit.

14:28.841 --> 14:30.542
I forgive you.

14:30.609 --> 14:32.177
Thanks.

14:32.244 --> 14:34.646
And I also know that you're into Rosa.

14:34.714 --> 14:36.147
You can read minds.

14:36.215 --> 14:37.882
No, no, no. It's very obvious.

14:37.950 --> 14:39.317
- Oh, shit!
- It's cool.

14:39.385 --> 14:40.618
I still think you're a good dude,

14:40.686 --> 14:41.987
you're a good guy,

14:42.054 --> 14:44.055
and I still want us to be friends.

14:44.123 --> 14:45.690
- For real?
- Absolutely.

14:48.527 --> 14:50.161
Wait, hold on.

14:50.229 --> 14:51.496
You forgot something.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.634
You said you'd watch it,
so you have to watch it.

14:56.702 --> 14:58.003
Uh, thank you, Jesus.

14:58.070 --> 15:00.038
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

15:00.106 --> 15:02.173
And, uh, thank you for having me, guys.

15:12.174 --> 15:15.336
So no more of that spinny, whirly thing?

15:15.361 --> 15:17.428
Yeah, no, there should be...
There should be very little

15:17.496 --> 15:18.696
spinny, whirly thing.

15:18.764 --> 15:20.298
And... and I can still get on Facebook?

15:20.366 --> 15:21.966
- I...
- Huh?

15:22.034 --> 15:23.668
Yes, yes, you... You... okay.

15:23.736 --> 15:27.405
Go here, type the word, "Facebook."

15:27.473 --> 15:28.873
Like, here is... Here's mine.

15:28.941 --> 15:30.908
Ooh-la-la!

15:30.976 --> 15:32.910
Who's this lovely lass?

15:32.978 --> 15:34.712
She's just a girl I work with.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.214
She's quite a looker.

15:36.282 --> 15:38.383
I... I... she's beautiful,
but she also...

15:38.450 --> 15:39.817
uh... has a boyfriend,

15:39.885 --> 15:43.921
who is actually a really special person.

15:45.991 --> 15:47.558
- Joshua?
- Hmm?

15:47.626 --> 15:50.795
Do you mind if I give
you some man advice?

15:50.863 --> 15:53.164
Uh... no, no, I don't mind.

15:53.232 --> 15:56.467
When I first met your mother,
she had a boyfriend.

15:56.535 --> 15:57.869
Just like your little lady here.

15:57.936 --> 16:01.072
But I snagged her anyway.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.307
You want to know how?

16:02.374 --> 16:04.709
Uh... yeah, okay, how?

16:04.777 --> 16:06.711
I waited.

16:06.779 --> 16:08.446
Oh, that... that's the...
that's the... okay.

16:08.514 --> 16:10.348
So... you just waited?

16:10.416 --> 16:12.583
Well, I wasn't sitting by the phone,

16:12.651 --> 16:14.686
if you know what I mean.

16:14.753 --> 16:17.288
No, what I did was crawl into a cave

16:17.356 --> 16:20.758
and fall into a five-month-long slumber.

16:20.826 --> 16:22.627
You mean you hibernated?

16:22.695 --> 16:24.729
I hibernated.

16:24.797 --> 16:26.764
<i>I ate twice my body weight in honey</i>

16:26.832 --> 16:28.866
<i>to give me a nice, thick layer of fat</i>

16:28.934 --> 16:32.970
<i>to keep me warm through the winter.</i>

16:33.038 --> 16:35.340
<i>Then I covered myself
with leaves and brush</i>

16:35.407 --> 16:38.309
<i>and slowed my heart rate to
about 9 beats per minute,</i>

16:38.377 --> 16:41.946
<i>allowing me to enter into a
kind of metabolic stasis.</i>

16:42.014 --> 16:43.915
<i>In the spring, I awoke and emerged</i>

16:43.982 --> 16:47.118
<i>from my cave to see where
things were at with your mom.</i>

16:47.186 --> 16:50.655
<i>She was still dating the
guy, so I kept waiting.</i>

16:50.723 --> 16:52.523
Huh.

16:52.591 --> 16:56.461
Seasons came and went, your
mother seeing other men,

16:56.528 --> 16:58.563
me slumbering in my cave,

16:58.630 --> 17:02.266
occasionally lumbering out to
steal food from campsites...

17:02.334 --> 17:04.868
that is, until the campers
started putting it

17:04.936 --> 17:06.938
<i>in these metal containers
I couldn't open.</i>

17:07.005 --> 17:08.873
Lord love a duck!

17:14.279 --> 17:17.013
And... and that whole time,
you never had a girlfriend?

17:17.082 --> 17:19.717
I had companionship.

17:27.826 --> 17:29.727
What the?

17:29.795 --> 17:32.764
But no matter what unspeakable acts

17:32.831 --> 17:35.199
I was engaged in, your mom was always

17:35.267 --> 17:38.035
number one in my mind.

17:38.103 --> 17:40.972
Then... one spring...

17:41.039 --> 17:42.240
came the worst day of my life.

17:45.010 --> 17:46.844
<i>I found out your mom had gotten married.</i>

17:49.648 --> 17:51.215
No!

17:55.587 --> 17:58.556
<i>And I was captured and sold
into a Russian circus.</i>

18:00.426 --> 18:04.128
<i>I performed for jeering
cossacks seven times a day.</i>

18:04.196 --> 18:08.232
<i>Sergei was my trainer, my
friend, and my tormentor.</i>

18:08.300 --> 18:11.095
_

18:12.004 --> 18:14.772
But then one day I heard that
your mom had gotten divorced.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.775
So I escaped the circus,
relearned English,

18:17.843 --> 18:19.777
and asked her out to dinner.

18:19.845 --> 18:21.779
My plan had worked perfectly.

18:21.847 --> 18:24.849
- Well...
