48:31.910 --> 48:33.590
"Baba Keita," Senegal Express

48:34.190 --> 48:36.990
, The foundation is entering a new era

48:37.700 --> 48:39.910

48:39.990 --> 48:42.300
, Idrissa Diop

48:42.150 --> 48:44.700
involved
The murder of a French policeman in Paris

That's where he died

48:48.430 --> 48:50.310
.I'm sorry to hear

48:50.390 --> 48:51.190
So do we

48:51.270 --> 48:53.110
I think Mr. Diop

48:53.190 --> 48:54.710
He is no longer employed by us

48:54.790 --> 48:57.790
,other than that
I do not know him personally

48:57.870 --> 49:00.390

49:05.950 --> 49:07.190

49:34.950 --> 49:35.910

50:03.950 --> 50:06.510
The accusation is very serious

50:07.230 --> 50:09.270
We can call the police

50:10.470 --> 50:11.470
I am the police

50:12.470 --> 50:13.830
Baba Keita, the French police

50:14.390 --> 50:15.910
- Mr. Keith?
.Yes-

50:15.990 --> 50:17.270
You are in the United States

50:17.350 --> 50:18.150
.U.S

50:18.390 --> 50:19.710
Not in a French colony

50:20.190 --> 50:22.470
The US police may be interested
As I know

50:23.270 --> 50:24.310
Keith

50:24.550 --> 50:26.230
Maybe you do not know

50:26.310 --> 50:28.790
, That we enjoy diplomatic immunity

50:29.190 --> 50:32.670
My wife and I and the security team

50:33.910 --> 50:35.110
?do you understand this

50:36.950 --> 50:38.700
?Do you understand

50:39.870 --> 50:43.300
No one is interrogating us

50:43.630 --> 50:45.390
This is an act of war

50:45.470 --> 50:48.390
And I can respond to your liquidation

50:50.310 --> 50:52.300
But why bother the French

50:52.870 --> 50:54.670
When we get along so well

50:54.990 --> 50:56.300
,Baside that

50:56.790 --> 50:59.510
We are not murderers
Despite what you think

51:01.870 --> 51:05.510
Report to the French authorities

51:20.990 --> 51:21.950
.will see

51:23.230 --> 51:24.590
Someone might investigate

51:24.990 --> 51:26.300
And find out something

51:26.950 --> 51:29.670
Do not go near the Torres

51:30.700 --> 51:30.990
And if I get closer

51:33.830 --> 51:36.310
!police! Download the weapon

51:36.550 --> 51:38.470
That shit belongs to me

51:41.150 --> 51:43.710
Kaita, today. Come on, let 's go

51:46.670 --> 51:47.630
See you soon, criminals

51:53.990 --> 51:55.230
...It's you

51:58.830 --> 52:01.630
What 's going on, man?
Are you mad?

52:02.110 --> 52:03.750
Hey, you 're working on me

52:04.310 --> 52:05.430
Hey, I 'm talking to you

52:05.510 --> 52:06.310
"Services"

52:08.300 --> 52:10.700
You thought I was an idiot
When you told me about your cousin

52:12.910 --> 52:15.470
I'll catch you, shit

52:15.990 --> 52:18.430
.No way. no no no

52:18.510 --> 52:21.590
It's a crime. You can not
.Do it. This is America

52:21.830 --> 52:24.870
You read my bag, right?
Conquering is my specialty. Do not worry

52:25.390 --> 52:27.630
.Knows what? Let's try a new approach

52:28.190 --> 52:30.350
I 'm not an idiot, okay?

52:30.430 --> 52:33.910
What the hell happened there
When you were with all your cousins

52:33.990 --> 52:35.470
?what is the deal

52:37.590 --> 52:38.630
You will not like this

52:39.710 --> 52:41.190
.try me. please

52:41.670 --> 52:44.190
I think this fund is a cover

52:44.950 --> 52:47.150
The Torres
They deal in dirty money

52:47.230 --> 52:48.700
Smuggling cocaine

52:48.270 --> 52:49.910
.no no. Not in Miami

52:50.310 --> 52:54.350
There are 20 state and federal agencies
Supervising the market. No way

52:54.430 --> 52:57.830
I can tell you
The cocaine is coming to Deloah, okay?

52:57.910 --> 53:00.150
He entered Africa and was sent to France

53:00.750 --> 53:03.150
I don 't know what' s going on here in Miami
But I'll find out

53:04.630 --> 53:06.790
Wait a minute, the drugs arrive through Delaware

53:06.870 --> 53:09.910
Delwa. West Africa
You know where Africa is, do not you?

53:10.750 --> 53:11.670
.More or less

53:13.630 --> 53:17.310
So you investigated
The smuggling network in Paris?

53:17.390 --> 53:18.670
.Not a chance. It's too big for me

53:19.670 --> 53:22.230
I'm just a regular cop
This was the interrogation of a friend of mine

53:22.830 --> 53:24.750
A senior man killed
.exactly-

53:25.510 --> 53:26.670
.My Best Friend

53:27.670 --> 53:30.700
Oh, I'm sorry, I did not know

53:31.750 --> 53:32.950
... Idrissa Diop

53:34.110 --> 53:35.270
He was one of the assassins

53:36.110 --> 53:38.300
The other guy
I'm sure it was Max Giroux

53:38.430 --> 53:39.430
You have no proof

53:39.510 --> 53:41.230
No, because he was in a mask

We talked the whole trip

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.630
It is not responsible. He did not know

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:04.190
I have plans, he did not know

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:06.670
And that's exactly my problem with him

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.150

The truck you reached was scanned

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.700
The dogs went through it thoroughly

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.300
And what is the result?

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:23.310

, Otherwise I will inform your consulate

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:44.630
On its black list

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.430

Baba, stop the nonsense

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:28.270
I can not concentrate

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:29.550
Where are my things?

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.700

01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:48.270
Whose is it?

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:49.670
It was Roland's

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:52.110
.I have known

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.310
This is not your reporter

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:57.910
, Leave Colombo
Sherlock Holmes

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.110
...Listen

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:02.950
I tried to figure it out

01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:07.710
I think it's a license number

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:09.910
.Beauty
That 's a clue. You checked-

01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:13.470

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.710
Hello, Officer Keita
Hello, Madam Consul-

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:00.630

01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:01.790
.Yes

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.150
I wanted to congratulate you

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:05.630
I did not do anything
All thanks to Detective Garcia

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.310
I want us to talk about

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.590
The annoying incident
It was not long ago

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:17.670
The Torres will be
, At a garden party of 100th anniversary celebrations

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.710
And that would be an opportunity
Ideal to apologize

01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:26.590
That 's an order, ma'am

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.830
Let's say if you do not do it

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:33.870
You can go back to giving
Parking reports in Belleville

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:40.510
- Mr. Keith?

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.630
Mrs. Tora projector wants to talk to you

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:44.910

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.700
.you're surprised

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:00.710
.I understand

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:02.950
Thank you for meeting me

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:06.510
?I can help you

01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:14.950
You need to contact
With this man in Douala

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.350
Abdoulaye Umassa

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:19.670
Why should I?

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.550
He wants to get in
You 're bringing the Torres to jail, like you

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:29.870
And why should I trust you

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:31.870
Ask people

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:34.870
, The state wants only one thing

01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:36.990
Put an end to this corrupt regime

01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:40.910
"Deloah, Africa"

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:51.870
.Thanks

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:00.390
Omasa command

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.470
Yes, Baba Keita
The French police. Hello

01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:06.750
I heard about your little intervention
At the conference of the Torres

01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:09.830
I was impressed that we could cooperate

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:11.430
Did you know Roland Weber?

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.590
Your friend Roland
He made the wrong decision

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:16.950
, He chose the wrong route
Our Interior Ministry

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.870
This is the wrong place
Because he protects the Tora clan

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:21.390
He was murdered the next day

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:23.630
But how are you still alive?

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:26.550
I'm less dangerous
The Tora couple confirms your friend

01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:30.510
Everyone in Douala knows
The president's brother smuggles drugs

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:34.710
From the point of view of the French police and Interpol
Roland changed the rules of the game

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.390
So he was murdered

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.190
And you think Ladji Tora
He ordered the assassination

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:41.990
.There is no doubt. Tora and his wife

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.750
Keita, I'm willing to share with you
All the information I have

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:47.830
Where did you get your investigation?

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:49.390
The truth is that there is a place

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.590
I followed the humanitarian shipment
, The latter until customs

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.430
Where they searched thoroughly
But they found nothing

01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:56.110
What customs are you talking about?

01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:57.270
In Miami

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.830
And I can not think of a way
When the drugs passed

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:01.910
The drugs came here, I assure you

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:05.270
You seem to have loaded it
Sending the shipment elsewhere

01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:08.350
Maybe the plane
He did not fly directly to Africa

01:18:08.710 --> 01:18:12.670
A week ago I tried to get the number
The plane's license, but I could not

01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:14.790
A license number like a car

01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:15.830
.Yes exactly

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:18.270
We can locate the plane
Using the license number

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:20.630
...license number

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:22.390
"Keep me informed, Keith

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:23.630
.I'll call you
.Goodbye-

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.300
.Good. Thank you, Abdoulaye
.Successfully-

01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:39.990
?Hi how are you

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.430
I understand why you're angry with me

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:50.870
, If I knew you'd be dragged into it

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:53.110
I would not go
That warehouse alone, I swear

01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:54.950
I think I'm angry at you

01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:56.910
?Yes. I did something else

01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:59.990
You saved my life first
Then you acted behind my back

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.630
You do not think I can
Take a chance for a friend

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:05.590
.You're right

01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:09.470
You should have trusted me
Remember, I owe you

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:11.990
.I'm sorry

01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:14.870

But I'm really sorry, okay? Good
.Yes Yes-

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.510
This is an airplane license number

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:27.710
I'll bet anything
This is Tora's plane

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.630
Can you help me look at him?

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:31.990
? You have a friend in the

01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:33.230
Why the FBI?

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.230
Because in the movies all the policemen have a friend
The FBI or the CIA. Always

01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:41.590
I do not have a friend who works for the CIA
Or at the FBI

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:42.670
.Too bad

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:44.390
But I have a friend who works

My friend wants to ask you a question

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:01.710
?can you help me

Look for him
.Yes-

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:22.470
Yes, it's definitely a license number

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:25.630
It is registered in a name
, Foundation for African Children

01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:30.550
And he's parked right here
It 's the airplane you' re looking for

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:32.870
And the flight route, you have access to it

01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:33.910
Flight route

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:35.870
Yes, thank you, flight ... the mass of the plane

01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:37.430
The flight route, most of them

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.300
.Yes please. Same

Yes, we found. He's supposed to take off
In 48 hours to ... Caracas

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:49.700
Caracas, where they load the drug

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.790
They put him in the humanitarian plane

01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:54.710
,exactly. They load the drug
Some people bribe

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:57.300
, Then the next stop is Africa
No one will look

01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:01.550
You needed the FBI
?for this

01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:08.630
Mrs. Mendez, Inspector
Enjoy our party

01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:22.390

Garcia

01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:45.830
.Come here

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:47.910
?now

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:49.510
!Yes now! Come on

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:50.750
.forgive me

01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:52.150
I hope you feel inspired

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.910
, If you have any concerns
Think about Belleville

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.190
Mrs Tora, Mr Tora

01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:04.950
You seem to know me
, Our liaison officer

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.300
Keith

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:07.190
Keith

01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:09.190
.good to see you again

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:11.230
... It's true that your first encounter was

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.510
How to say? Not so pleasant

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:15.830
But Mr. Keitha
I want to tell you something

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:16.870
?I am

01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:18.910
.Yes, absolutely

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:22.470
I apologize heartily
About my dreadful behavior

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:25.710
It must have stayed for me from Belleville
That's where I come from

01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:27.270
You know Belleville?

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:28.790
Were you there?

01:22:32.230 --> 01:22:34.710
Sorry I hinted
You smuggle drugs

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:36.700
This is definitely not true

01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:38.790
You did not even invite the murder
A French cop

01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:40.710
.Not at all. Obviously

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.150
Otherwise you would not be here

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:46.630
We all agree

01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:47.910
It seemed clear to me

01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:54.390
.of course

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:55.430
Enjoy

01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:57.150
Have fun, Mr. Keith

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:04.470
I remembered, I was in Belleville

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.150
.Once

01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:08.390
Your boyfriend was away too, right?

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:10.270
I know it's you

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:12.910
He died where he grew up

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:14.590
I think it's exciting

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.710
Hit him

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:26.590
!Hi hi
This is cheating, man. no no

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:27.710
Break it

01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:32.510
Garcia, do not move

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.230
I'll see you, man

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.230
...sailing

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:46.630
?Are you okay

01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:52.630
Why every time I 'm with you?
I 'm wrecking good shoes. Why

01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:54.150
Really sorry, man. Sorry

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:55.430
Well, forget it

01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:05.830
?Good. What are you going to do?

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:10.310
First the hardest thing

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:13.830
Tell my mother

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.430
!mother

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.700
Honey, you're home

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:40.390
Take
?Gift-

01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:43.430
This is suspicious. It's not Mother's Day

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:44.470
I know it 's not today

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:46.230
But I wanted to say good-bye to you
Thank you for the tip of the thread

01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:49.150
What an end
There were so many

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:50.510
The business card

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:55.110
The business card
So it was a license number

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.470
?Views

01:24:56.590 --> 01:25:00.830
Believe me when I tell you
This is it. "But you do not need a gift"

01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:02.510
We are a team

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:06.990
take. Put it
On my bedside table

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:10.230
Well, put it on your desk
Next to the bed, Mrs. Kardashian

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:13.190
Honey, there's food in the fridge

01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:14.550
Well, but we are
We need to talk, Mom

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:17.230
.no no. Not now
Please do not disturb me

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:19.950
Ernesto and I have to finish

01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:22.910
.so warm

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:25.190
Ernesto

01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:27.590
- Finish what?

01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:29.670
- Finish what?

01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:34.630
Why did I tell her to have a good time?

01:25:42.630 --> 01:25:44.670
.Hi it's me. It's Baba

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:47.510
What is that voice? Are you okay

01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:50.990
I must tell you
I got off Roland's interrogation

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:54.790
The truth is that it is not only
This investigation. I got fired

01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.830
What a stupid thing you did
- They fired you

01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:01.700
I really screwed up

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:02.390
How did you mess?

01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.630
The consul gave me two weeks to pack

01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:06.470
Mother still does not know the news

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:09.700
No, do not talk to me
About your mother again

01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:10.310
Miami

01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:12.270
I really do not know
How to tell my mother

01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:14.310
.I understand you
I did not tell Shelly either

01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:16.510
She'll have a safe heart attack

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:22.230
This will give her time to get used to it
You can go to see sites

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:27.310
, And if you want
I'll teach you to surf

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.700
You will teach me Kung Fu
?what are you saying

01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:31.190
Are you surfing?

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:34.230
Come on, man. you are joking
This is Miami. What do you think

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:44.350
Kaita, this is Abdoulaye

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.150
?What's going on

01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:47.550
There was a coup

01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:50.670
The people and the army in Rehovot
The President resigned and ran away

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:52.190
There is a new government

01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:53.310
?What do you mean

01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:54.830
That means things have changed

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:57.590
The new minister signed an arrest warrant
, To Taji Ladji

01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:59.270
Laman Torre and Max Giroux

01:26:59.350 --> 01:27:02.670
He's on his way to Interpol now
And will be distributed everywhere

01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:04.870
That means the Miami police
Can you stop them?

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.150
.too late
They had already fled to Caracas

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:09.670
I'm sure in the next 48 hours

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:12.670
They'll be here to unload
Their last drug shipment

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:16.870
, There is an illegal runway somewhere
But I do not know where he is

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:18.830
I have a girlfriend
Who works at Interpol in Paris

01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:20.310
Maybe she could help you
Find them

01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:21.750
.it's going to be wonderful

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.300
We have only two days

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.830
I have to catch them
Before they go away

01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:28.790
Well, I'll keep you informed
Thank you, Abdoulaye

01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:36.790
Ricardo, I have to ask you a favor
You can take care of my mother

I fly to Africa
?what-

01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:42.550
Abdoulaye will try to arrest the couple
Tora and Max in two days in Douala

01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:44.630
If I go now
Enough to join him

01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:46.230
Leave me with those two

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:48.150
You can not come to Africa
With your ulcer

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.630
You 're out of your mind, brother

01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:53.190

Finish it together

01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:55.670
, Ulcer or not ulcer

They ride together, die together
