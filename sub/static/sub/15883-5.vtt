WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:02.500
(<i>Hail to the Chief</i> plays)

00:04.090 --> 00:05.950
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.870
With me, as always,
is my anger translator Luther.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.180
Boom, Mitt!

00:10.430 --> 00:13.880
I sunk your battleship, bitch!
What's up?!

00:14.570 --> 00:17.920
To the American people, I just want
to say that the debates are over

00:18.440 --> 00:21.430
but now is not a time
to tally points

00:21.510 --> 00:23.050
or to, uh, keep the score.

00:23.150 --> 00:25.060
2-1, Obama.

00:25.070 --> 00:28.900
Game, set, match,
touchdown, homerun, checkmate.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.670
Can we get back to work now?

00:30.820 --> 00:32.860
Governor Romney,
in the recent debate,

00:32.960 --> 00:35.660
I laid out the inconsistencies
in your stated beliefs.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.600
Okay, Governor Rom... Listen,
I'm gonna tell you a little...

00:38.670 --> 00:41.930
Governor Romney,
why are you smiling

00:42.000 --> 00:43.640
while you're getting
your ass kicked?

00:43.680 --> 00:46.990
Are we debating, or are you trying
to sell me a Lexus?

00:47.060 --> 00:50.030
I directly questioned you
about your opposition

00:50.070 --> 00:51.480
to the auto industry bailout.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.450
On behalf of all the people in Detroit
that want to stab you,

00:54.460 --> 00:57.800
I ask again,
why are you smiling?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.190
I asked you about
your stance on Syria,

01:00.280 --> 01:02.210
which you called
"Iran's route to the sea."

01:02.220 --> 01:04.750
Hey... Dummy... Look!

01:04.849 --> 01:07.620
Iran is on the sea.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.360
Syria's two god damn
countries this way.

01:10.460 --> 01:13.730
Bam...
which is a city in iran.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.830
I even reminded you
that horses and bayonets

01:16.900 --> 01:19.650
are not strategically valid
in modern warfare.

01:19.690 --> 01:22.440
So like I said, it's time
to wipe that smug smile

01:22.490 --> 01:26.440
off your sweaty, sweaty,
pasty-ass sweaty face.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.270
I mean, Mitt,
do you need a towel?

01:28.310 --> 01:31.580
Because your face is
straight up raining.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.250
I spoke about brinksmanship
with Iran,

01:34.320 --> 01:36.320
and you just said
you wanted a peaceful planet.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.690
I mean, who let
Wavy Gravy up in here?

01:38.790 --> 01:39.540
I'm sorry, Mitt.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.770
If you want to be the first
mormon hippie,

01:41.810 --> 01:43.620
you're gonna need to grow
your hair out, dog.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.220
(shrieking)
and quit smiling!

01:45.260 --> 01:46.950
[bleep]!
This got me...

01:47.020 --> 01:49.190
There were many times
where you even, uh,

01:49.230 --> 01:50.710
inexplicably agreed with me.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.120
Stop agreeing with me!

01:53.130 --> 01:55.930
Are you trying to body snatch me
and become me

01:56.100 --> 01:58.650
for the last two weeks
of the election?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.170
I mean, what's...
I'm sorry, time out.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.590
Sir, I'm, like,
legitimately concerned

02:03.070 --> 02:06.220
that he's like an insane,
rich, crazy person who's gonna...

02:06.290 --> 02:07.590
- Luther...
- Wait, okay, yeah.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.220
- Calm down now.
- Okay.

02:09.370 --> 02:11.800
I assure you,
Governor Romney's not insane.

02:12.140 --> 02:13.150
- Okay.
- Thank you.

02:13.190 --> 02:14.820
- No problem.
- In conclusion...

02:15.100 --> 02:17.930
I greatly appreciated our
exchange on foreign policy.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.300
But we all know the only
country that matters...

02:20.490 --> 02:21.490
is Ohio.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.790
You sweaty, smiley,

02:24.280 --> 02:27.410
never-gonna-be-president
looking mother-[bleep].

02:27.540 --> 02:29.020
- What?
- Hey...

02:29.660 --> 02:31.290
Loosing up a little bit
over here.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.860
And it's just about
[bleep]ing time.

02:57.490 --> 02:59.960
- Hello!
- Hi.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.230
Thank you.

03:01.290 --> 03:02.330
Thank you.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.430
Thank you for coming.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.580
Thank you so much.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.820
Welcome to the show.
I'm Keegan-Michael Key.

03:09.850 --> 03:11.650
- I am Jordan Peele.
- We are Key and Peele.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.570
- Thank you for coming.
- Key... and Peele.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.810
Thank you!

03:16.710 --> 03:17.880
So...

03:18.620 --> 03:21.050
The other day you and I
were talking about

03:21.410 --> 03:24.050
why there are no longer
rap groups.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.020
Rap groups.
Do you guys...

03:25.060 --> 03:26.530
Do you know
what happened to rap groups?

03:26.590 --> 03:28.830
There are rappers...
and there are collaborations.

03:28.870 --> 03:29.320
Right.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.790
- But there are no longer rap groups.
- Right.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.080
Wu-tang Clan... they had...

03:34.150 --> 03:35.050
[cheers]
Oh, yeah.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.420
- Right.
- These dudes...

03:36.490 --> 03:39.440
- They had like 36 dudes on stage.
- Yeah, right.

03:39.630 --> 03:41.560
- With like katana blades,
- What's a katana blade ?

03:41.660 --> 03:43.430
dressed like [bleep] Ninja Turtles.

03:43.590 --> 03:46.990
Or-or-or public enemy had...
[cheers]

03:47.150 --> 03:50.440
You know, like one rapper,
a crazy man with a clock,

03:51.740 --> 03:53.350
- and a security force.
- Yeah.

03:53.410 --> 03:55.450
Arrested Development.
That's kind of rap group.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.670
(cheers and applause)
Yeah!

03:58.090 --> 04:00.940
These dudes... they were
the first band, I think in history

04:00.980 --> 04:02.910
just to have a black woman
on stage going like that...

04:02.920 --> 04:04.810
- Right. Yeah, yeah.
- For no reason.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.160
- There was just...
- There's no reason for it.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.470
That's right.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.040
And a little old man
in a rocking chair,

04:13.080 --> 04:15.920
just an old man

Brock Favors here,

05:35.910 --> 05:38.230
We are here live
at the Metro Police Department

05:38.400 --> 05:40.080
canine training facility,

05:40.150 --> 05:42.970
And we are going to be learning
some apprehension techniques

05:43.040 --> 05:44.760
used by the canine unit.

05:44.790 --> 05:48.030
Now, Officer Hanson, uh, I will
be playing the assailant today.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.360
- Is that correct?
- Yeah, that's correct.

05:49.430 --> 05:52.310
Now, Officer Hanson, I am
perfectly safe in this suit, right?

05:52.470 --> 05:54.080
Yeah, you're 100% safe.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.570
In fact, those are the suits
we use for officer training.

05:56.610 --> 05:58.000
All right!
Well, there you go.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.260
Well, kids, make sure
that you do not try this at home

06:00.320 --> 06:01.590
with your chihuahuas.

06:01.650 --> 06:03.190
Ow! Ow! Ow!
[bleep]!

06:03.230 --> 06:05.460
Get this [bleep] off of me!
Get this [bleep] off of me!

06:05.560 --> 06:07.460
Damn!
Get this [bleep] off of me!

06:07.560 --> 06:08.630
[bleep]!

06:08.660 --> 06:11.270
Oh, God damn!
Oh, God damn!

06:11.330 --> 06:14.240
Oh, [bleep]!
Whoo!

06:14.450 --> 06:17.360
Okie dokey.
I am sorry...

06:17.730 --> 06:19.470
that, uh, you all just

06:19.850 --> 06:22.860
heard me use that inappropriate
language that was very uncalled for.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.480
- When you panic like that...
- Yeah.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.830
He thinks you're more
of a threat than you are.

06:25.900 --> 06:26.410
Uh-huh.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.860
That's when he's gonna
bite down harder.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.730
Okay, well, I will...
make an effort this time to...

06:31.030 --> 06:33.970
really try and be
as calm as possible

06:34.310 --> 06:36.050
even though it is
very difficult to be calm

06:36.410 --> 06:38.180
when you're in the lion's den.

06:38.220 --> 06:40.610
Or should I say the doggie den?
You know what I mean?

06:40.680 --> 06:42.380
(screaming)
Oh, [bleep]!

06:42.450 --> 06:44.980
Oh, [bleep]!
This dog is eating my junk!

06:45.050 --> 06:46.590
He's eating my junk!
No!

06:46.650 --> 06:48.980
Oh, [bleep]!
He's got my junk!

06:49.010 --> 06:50.860
Aghh! Oh, my God!
Get him off me!

06:50.960 --> 06:53.960
[happy music]

06:55.380 --> 06:57.050
- That's, uh...
- You don't even know...

06:57.050 --> 06:58.050
Oh, boy.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.690
Until you've seen a dog go after
Keegan-Michael Key's testicles

07:01.730 --> 07:03.370
Four takes in a row.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.110
And this...
I love you came into that day cocky.

07:06.190 --> 07:09.070
I couldn't wait. I was like,
"Let him go, let him do it!"

07:09.130 --> 07:11.120
- He's like,
"I got the [bleep] suit on.

07:11.170 --> 07:11.870
- Oh, man.

07:11.870 --> 07:13.170
"He's not gonna be able
to penetrate."

07:13.240 --> 07:16.590
Well, this whole area
was protected seven-fold.

07:16.930 --> 07:20.150
So...I didn't feel anything
when the dog was there.

07:20.210 --> 07:22.610
It's when I fell on the ground...
And they said,

07:22.670 --> 07:24.890
"Let him go at it again while
Keegan's laying on the ground.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.960
"Let him get in there
and get the crotch."

07:25.960 --> 07:26.910
"Just get in there!"

07:26.920 --> 07:28.360
- And that dog came
right in here, went bip!

07:28.370 --> 07:29.600
and got my thigh.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.200
And our magic word was "Uncle."

07:32.300 --> 07:34.650
No one has ever said the word
"uncle" faster in their life.

07:34.700 --> 07:38.070
I was like, "Ah! Ah!
Uncle-uncle-uncle-uncle-uncle!

07:38.500 --> 07:39.870
"That's real! It's real!
It's real, it's real!"

07:39.940 --> 07:41.410
- And then... you wanna know some...
- It's real!

07:41.470 --> 07:43.360
You wanna know
some really scary [bleep]?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.560
That dude that owned the dog...
My man said,

07:45.680 --> 07:48.150
"Stop, stop, stop!
<i>Nein!"</i>

07:50.550 --> 07:53.850
- This dog said...
- That dog was like...

07:53.920 --> 07:55.190
That dog came up...

07:57.320 --> 07:58.790
(laughing)

08:00.660 --> 08:02.720
[soul music]

08:03.120 --> 08:05.580
I think that I'm the worst
<i>Halo</i> player in the world.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.610
You are
the worst <i>Halo</i> player.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.520
I'm the worst <i>Halo</i> player
in the world. I played with my brother.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.700
I realize I shouldn't have
brought that up.

08:09.710 --> 08:10.870
Remember when my brother
came over that one time?

08:10.910 --> 08:11.210
Yeah.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.710
We just spent 25 minutes just going,

08:12.750 --> 08:14.690
"Why don't you just go around
the backside of the cliff?

08:14.940 --> 08:17.580
"I can't find...
Just get out of my way then.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.780
"Well, how am I... There's a thing!
Don't shoot it! Shoot it!

08:19.850 --> 08:21.250
"Oh! I'm off the cliff!"

08:21.260 --> 08:23.600
You know, just fall off the cliff.
And then I...

08:23.670 --> 08:26.370
- You know, then I'd reanimate.
- Just two grown-ass men.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.860
Just two grown men who just
reverted to eight-year-olds.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.190
So you can say
as much as you want.

08:34.230 --> 08:36.380
But you can't say
the name of the celebrity

08:36.429 --> 08:38.090
or any part of their name,
got it?

08:38.120 --> 08:39.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we got it.

08:39.289 --> 08:40.860
- We got it.
- You are so gonna lose.

08:40.909 --> 08:41.980
Baby, you are going down.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.780
Why don't you start the timer
and be amazed?

08:43.850 --> 08:46.070
And... go.

08:47.770 --> 08:50.090
Okay, this guy...
"E" equals mc squared.

08:50.220 --> 08:51.630
- Albert Einstein.
- Yes, that is correct.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.000
What?
That's easy. Hello?

08:53.020 --> 08:55.150
Okay, this is the Terminator.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.090
- Arnold Schwarzenegger!
- Yeah!

08:57.160 --> 08:58.320
Okay, we got... we got...

08:58.380 --> 09:00.450
Talking about, uh...
"Are you talking to me?"

09:00.570 --> 09:03.010
- Robert De Niro!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:03.050 --> 09:04.290
All right.
All right.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.910
This person pretend to be
straight but he's really gay.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.100
Me!

09:08.170 --> 09:09.720
(timer ticking)

09:13.710 --> 09:15.880
Uh, uh... he is, uh...
(clears throat)

09:15.940 --> 09:17.750
Excuse me.
He's living <i>la vida loca.</i>

09:19.440 --> 09:20.250
Me.

09:20.470 --> 09:21.430
- It's...
- No.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.050
- Okay.
- He's a, um...

09:24.120 --> 09:25.620
Latin pop star.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.580
I'm not a Latin pop star.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.740
No, you are not.
It's not you.

09:30.390 --> 09:31.930
"He bangs, he bangs."

09:31.990 --> 09:34.990
- Oh, Ricky Martin.
- That is correct.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.700
I wrote that one too.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.040
(ding)

09:39.110 --> 09:40.980
Tyrell about to come
out here right now.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.910
- 'sup, ladies?
- Watch this, watch this.

09:42.970 --> 09:44.440
Yo, Tyrell.

09:44.510 --> 09:45.760
Yo, what up, Lawrence?

09:45.810 --> 09:47.180
Hey, man, you wanna play
front hand, back hand?

09:47.220 --> 09:49.090
- I don't know that game, man.
- It's easy, dog.

09:49.140 --> 09:51.450
All you gotta do is say
"front hand" or "back hand."

09:51.510 --> 09:53.450
- Aight, front hand.
- Ugh!

09:53.520 --> 09:55.050
(all laughing)

09:55.120 --> 09:56.830
Bam! I got you, sucka!

09:59.560 --> 10:02.340
Oh, okay. Okay.
I see how it is now.

10:02.390 --> 10:05.080
Come on, man. Come on.
You know that [bleep] was funny]

10:05.180 --> 10:07.390
- Back hand.
- Huh?

10:07.400 --> 10:10.900
It's still my move, right?
I choose back hand this time.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.630
- Really?
- Back hand, [bleep]!

10:16.170 --> 10:17.510
Uh...

10:18.970 --> 10:21.130
Oh!
(laughter)

10:21.250 --> 10:22.790
- God damn!

10:24.020 --> 10:26.790
Look, Ty, I'm sorry,
but I ain't sorry. Know what I mean?

10:26.800 --> 10:30.720
I mean, you asked for it.
I mean, you literally asked for it.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.450
Front hand!

10:32.520 --> 10:34.550
What? No.
Why you wanna hit...

10:34.690 --> 10:36.520
I... got it!
I figured it out.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.220
Front hand!
No, back hand! Back hand!

10:39.300 --> 10:40.510
No, look, look.
Dude... Hey...

10:40.610 --> 10:43.110
If you want me to slap you
across the face back hand, I'll do it.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.580
Okay?
Don't think I won't do it.

10:44.580 --> 10:45.960
But you know that
I'm [bleep] with you, right?

10:45.970 --> 10:48.260
I mean, there ain't no game
called "front hand, back hand."

10:49.620 --> 10:51.490
- Oh!
- Right. Yeah, yeah.

10:51.810 --> 10:54.480
Oh, dog!
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

10:54.510 --> 10:56.480
All right,
all right, all right.

10:56.710 --> 10:59.650
As soon as I get good
at "front hand, back hand",

10:59.850 --> 11:01.150
you wanna stop playing.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.250
Play what, man?

11:02.330 --> 11:04.508
I made it up so I could
smack you in the face.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.789
I'm about to smack <i>you</i>
in the face

11:07.025 --> 11:09.255
as soon as it's my turn.
Back hand!

11:09.327 --> 11:10.856
There ain't no turns,
[bleep],

11:10.960 --> 11:12.264
'cause it ain't no game.

11:12.282 --> 11:13.611
You ain't got no game,
[bleep].

11:13.647 --> 11:14.646
Back hand!

11:14.960 --> 11:15.803
Aghh!

11:26.302 --> 11:27.431
Front hand.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.324
Look, I don't know
if you're [bleep] with me

11:30.372 --> 11:31.971
at this point or what...

11:32.772 --> 11:35.952
but I don't wanna...
smack a [bleep] no more.

11:37.984 --> 11:40.544
(exaggerated laughter)
Where you going then?

11:40.559 --> 11:42.015
Okay, forfeit.

11:42.121 --> 11:45.895
Forfeit, [bleep], I win!
I win front hand, back hand!

11:45.936 --> 11:47.366
Okay.
Me and you.

11:47.436 --> 11:49.346
[bleep], me and you.
Me and you.

11:49.922 --> 11:51.690
Hmm?
Back hand.

11:55.900 --> 11:56.900
Ah!

11:58.584 --> 12:01.624
(hip-hop music)

12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
Oh!

12:07.180 --> 12:09.050
This November,
you gotta get out and vote!

12:09.762 --> 12:11.743
<i>It's all about democracy,
y'all.</i>

12:11.774 --> 12:14.268
Your vote gets counted with
the rest of the votes in the country

12:14.268 --> 12:16.664
<i>and they get sent off
to the Electoral College.</i>

12:17.089 --> 12:18.190
What's that?

12:18.260 --> 12:20.360
The Electoral College
are a bunch of officials

12:20.430 --> 12:21.800
who do the voting for us.

12:21.860 --> 12:23.460
So in case we elect
the wrong person,

12:23.530 --> 12:25.430
they can fix that shiz!

12:25.500 --> 12:27.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.843
- Who the hell are these people?
- Well, no one knows for sure,

12:30.879 --> 12:34.009
But whoever they is, they the folks
who actually do the real voting

12:34.038 --> 12:35.938
after we do our
pretend voting.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.080
Yeah!

12:37.150 --> 12:39.650
- Power to the...
- Hold the [bleep] on!

12:39.720 --> 12:41.780
You're telling me
our votes don't matter?

12:41.850 --> 12:44.050
Our votes are like
suggestions.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.750
So this November, we should...

12:45.820 --> 12:47.960
- Yeah!
- <i>Dunk the vote!</i>

12:51.082 --> 12:53.082
[soul music]

12:54.066 --> 12:56.358
You know what I really hate?
When, uh...

12:56.557 --> 12:59.055
Girls be... it's usually
white girls to be honest.

12:59.130 --> 13:00.997
I don't mean to make it racial,
but it is. Sorry.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.870
White girls saying...
just dropping "awkward."

13:05.940 --> 13:07.370
"Awkward."

13:07.440 --> 13:09.821
Bitch, it wasn't awkward
till you said some [bleep].

13:11.681 --> 13:13.351
(laughing

13:15.361 --> 13:17.153
What... who are you
pointing at, sir?

13:17.153 --> 13:18.453
(indistinct audience member)

13:18.679 --> 13:19.879
Oh, that's her?
She's doing the aw...

13:19.879 --> 13:21.165
- Did that happen yesterday?
- Same way.

13:21.165 --> 13:22.961
Same way.

13:23.007 --> 13:25.405
- And everybody was gonna let it go.
- Everyone was gonna let it go.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.673
- Everybody was gonna let it go.
- A moment of clarity.

13:27.673 --> 13:30.189
Oh, man. But she had to provide
a moment of clarity.

13:30.189 --> 13:32.207
She had to say...
"awkward."

13:34.157 --> 13:36.617
That is how black women do it,
with the little...

13:37.117 --> 13:39.417
- "Awkward."
- You ain't gon...

13:39.458 --> 13:43.258
I'm metaphorically
locking the car door on you.

13:44.684 --> 13:45.792
Bip.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.366
Tisket, tasket...
- This one back here.

13:49.397 --> 13:51.697
Green and yellow basket.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.276
- This is a limousine.

13:56.407 --> 13:58.832
(phone ringing)

13:59.993 --> 14:01.975
Hello? Thanks for calling
Mario's Pizza.

14:02.079 --> 14:04.752
- This is carlos speaking.
- <i>Allo.</i>

14:04.933 --> 14:08.663
We would like a large pie

14:08.705 --> 14:11.870
with pepperoni, pineapple,
and cheesy crust.

14:11.914 --> 14:15.254
Large pepperoni
with pineapple and cheesy crust.

14:15.457 --> 14:19.354
- We would also like
a large pie

14:19.682 --> 14:23.335
with bacon, pineapple,
and... cheesy crust.

14:23.397 --> 14:25.914
Large bacon, pineapple,
with cheesy crust. Okay.

14:25.922 --> 14:27.607
Is that gonna complete
your order, sir?

14:27.610 --> 14:29.320
You know what?
Let me gauge the room.

14:29.352 --> 14:31.816
Uh, guys, are we gonna want
another pizza?

14:31.878 --> 14:33.708
Let me just... who's hungry?
Show of hands.

14:33.721 --> 14:36.711
Let me see 'em.
One, two, three...

14:36.728 --> 14:39.426
Keep' em up.
Four, five, six.

14:39.500 --> 14:43.113
- <i>Ah, having a party.</i> (chuckling)
- Yup. Pretty big one too.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.800
Come on, guys, keep 'em up.
Hugo? Summer? Hans? Fu?

14:46.830 --> 14:48.630
You know what,
let's play it safe.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.984
Let's get another pie
with ham, pineapple.

14:52.054 --> 14:53.592
All right, ham...

14:53.609 --> 14:55.309
Oh, are you guys gonna need
cheesy crust on the third?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.237
Good question.
I'll gauge the room.

14:57.325 --> 15:00.635
Hey, guys, do we want
cheesy crust on the third?

15:00.868 --> 15:02.478
Okay, yeesh.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.020
That is a resounding yes

15:05.061 --> 15:07.361
for cheesy crust on the third.

15:07.479 --> 15:09.775
Claire says you read her mind.

15:09.847 --> 15:11.517
Claire, huh?
I like that name.

15:11.701 --> 15:12.912
It's a good one.

15:13.015 --> 15:16.023
Oh, also, my boy Andy over here

15:16.070 --> 15:18.908
is saying you have something
called chicken poppers.

15:18.935 --> 15:21.332
- Is she cute?
- <i>Uh, who's that and what now?</i>

15:21.456 --> 15:23.270
- Claire.
- Oh.

15:25.101 --> 15:26.699
Her body's like a four.

15:32.295 --> 15:35.465
Ha, let's just say
she's kind of a big girl.

15:35.592 --> 15:37.049
<i>That's all good.</i>

15:37.062 --> 15:39.866
That's all superficial, man.
I like Claire for what's inside.

15:40.019 --> 15:42.050
- You don't even know Claire.
- <i>Yo, but for real though,</i>

15:42.103 --> 15:44.143
I feel like
I do know Claire, man.

15:44.242 --> 15:46.306
Put me on the phone
with her.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.131
Uh...

15:49.611 --> 15:52.575
You don't need
to speak to Claire.

15:52.644 --> 15:53.856
No, I do.

15:56.252 --> 15:58.910
You know what,
I gotta level with you, man.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.294
I... [bleep] her.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.409
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

16:04.479 --> 16:07.239
I didn't mean to get
in between you guys.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.041
No, it's quite all right.

16:10.950 --> 16:12.694
'twas a while ago...

16:12.705 --> 16:14.400
Before she blimped up.

16:15.761 --> 16:17.731
My current girlfriend's Liv.

16:18.174 --> 16:22.043
Body, ten.
Face, ten.

16:23.700 --> 16:28.110
But anyway, Claire... Yeah.
I hit that, sexually.

16:28.815 --> 16:31.285
And, uh, as did my boy Hugo.

16:31.297 --> 16:33.387
Hell, even Bobba got
some of that.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.020
So just wanted you to know,
used goods, used goods.

16:37.310 --> 16:39.284
So you wouldn't care
if I asked her out?

16:39.897 --> 16:41.405
Well...

16:42.483 --> 16:43.967
Let me do it for you.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.935
Hey, Claire, this guy from
the pizza place wants to date you.

16:45.976 --> 16:47.845
Too poor? All right,
I'll let him down easy.

16:47.894 --> 16:49.536
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No.

16:51.661 --> 16:55.061
Tell her that, no,
I'm not a rich man.

16:55.132 --> 16:57.532
<i>But I'm a good man.
Tell her,</i>

16:57.623 --> 16:59.810
"Claire, I believe in destiny.

16:59.841 --> 17:03.205
"and I believe
that we've always known

17:03.269 --> 17:05.300
"that our soul mate
was out there.

17:05.397 --> 17:08.395
<i>"The moment that we had
that unspoken connection</i>

17:08.440 --> 17:10.310
<i>"about the cheesy crust...</i>

17:10.786 --> 17:13.185
<i>"I realized that you were
always the one.</i>

17:13.520 --> 17:17.017
"Because... and I know
this sounds corny...

17:18.089 --> 17:20.230
"but that moment...

17:20.984 --> 17:22.486
"was just like...

17:24.459 --> 17:25.829
"simple."

17:31.553 --> 17:32.370
Wow.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.900
You really do care
about Claire.

17:36.868 --> 17:38.385
I do.

17:39.438 --> 17:41.355
Oh, my God!
Claire just got shot!

17:41.397 --> 17:42.708
- What? No!
- Oh!

17:42.724 --> 17:44.357
Oh! It just came through the window.
It was a bullet.

17:44.382 --> 17:45.580
<i>It hit her in the neck. Oh...</i>

17:45.596 --> 17:47.226
Claire's down!
She's dead!

17:47.266 --> 17:49.303
She's dead! I'm calling the cops!
She's dead!

17:49.490 --> 17:52.040
Claire!
Noooo!

17:59.762 --> 18:01.532
Chinese it is.

18:02.330 --> 18:04.160
(soul music)

18:05.305 --> 18:08.236
One thing that fascinates us
is that like any movie

18:08.392 --> 18:11.762
- like <i>The Help</i> or...
- <i>Glory.</i>

18:12.176 --> 18:14.206
We call 'em like
"white man's burden" movies,

18:14.233 --> 18:15.309
'cause you know...

18:15.516 --> 18:17.316
White people go see
these movies,

18:17.342 --> 18:18.764
and then they come out
and they're like,

18:18.794 --> 18:22.003
"racism is alive!
Face it in the eyes!

18:24.275 --> 18:27.801
"Racism's still here
and I'm not taking it anymore!"

18:29.050 --> 18:32.760
Like I need to do a Def Jam
white guy voice, right?

18:33.360 --> 18:36.458
It's like Def Jam white guy
bordering on Jimmy Stewart.

18:56.793 --> 18:57.633
(gasp)

18:59.019 --> 19:01.845
- Are you Ms. Tubman?
- The name's Harriet.

19:02.289 --> 19:03.659
Well, thank God in heaven

19:03.688 --> 19:05.288
for the work
that you're doing, Harriet.

19:05.871 --> 19:10.370
Before you thank me,
let me tell you.

19:10.388 --> 19:13.172
I've led hundreds of slaves
to freedom

19:13.204 --> 19:16.060
through this here
underground railroad.

19:17.503 --> 19:21.403
But it ain't gon' be easy.
Are you ready?

19:23.225 --> 19:25.055
All right.

19:25.413 --> 19:27.470
Then hike up your breeches

19:27.534 --> 19:31.398
and follow me to freedom!

19:31.550 --> 19:32.880
(screaming)

19:32.950 --> 19:35.950
(adventurous music)

19:50.757 --> 19:52.897
Watch this, black molasses!

20:07.271 --> 20:09.271
Well, where is she now?

20:13.158 --> 20:15.098
That was the easy part.

20:15.157 --> 20:16.383
Now stay close.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.563
This next 500 miles
gets a little sticky.

20:20.462 --> 20:21.692
Ah!

20:23.813 --> 20:26.840
Forget this, man.
I'm going back.

20:32.910 --> 20:34.580
(cheers and applause)

20:35.543 --> 20:37.813
Thank you.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.523
Thank you so much, everybody.

20:42.665 --> 20:45.508
Everybody, thank you so much.
You've been a great audience...

20:45.534 --> 20:48.234
sexually, so...

20:48.427 --> 20:51.027
Good night!
Good night. Take care.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.220
(soul music)

20:55.303 --> 20:57.873
<i>♪ I'm gonna do
my one line here ♪</i>

20:57.984 --> 20:59.814
Oh, yeah.
