WEBVTT

04:20.067 --> 04:21.192
That's it.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.824
- How you doing'?
- What's up?

04:27.908 --> 04:29.034
All right.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.120
Pick it up.

04:32.538 --> 04:33.622
Look out.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.666
Coming through.

04:35.749 --> 04:38.127
You have to tell me where to turn.

04:56.562 --> 04:57.688
I knew it.

04:58.272 --> 04:59.731
She's not here.

05:00.315 --> 05:01.900
Frank! Sidney!

05:01.984 --> 05:03.610
I'll try the basement.

05:03.819 --> 05:05.028
Don't panic.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.281
She's around here somewhere.

05:08.365 --> 05:10.075
Faye!

05:10.826 --> 05:12.244
Come on out!

05:23.172 --> 05:24.256
You, you!

05:25.883 --> 05:28.844
Did you ever hear of private property?

05:29.720 --> 05:31.889
Just coming for a hamburger, pop.

05:32.139 --> 05:35.267
You got a lot of nerve!
Get your food somewhere else!

05:35.768 --> 05:36.935
Who's that?

05:37.311 --> 05:40.314
Take off that hat so I can get a look at you.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.566
Here she is. Faye!

05:42.649 --> 05:44.985
For the love of Mike, where you been?

05:45.736 --> 05:48.197
You scared the living daylights out of me!

05:48.280 --> 05:49.615
I did the marketing.

05:49.698 --> 05:52.117
Somebody's got to do the marketing.

05:57.539 --> 05:59.833
What are you looking at?

06:00.501 --> 06:02.544
Nothing, pop. Nothing.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.088
Was that Bobby?

06:05.422 --> 06:07.049
I think it was Bobby.

06:07.132 --> 06:09.968
No, dear, it wasn't Bobby.

06:10.385 --> 06:12.221
It was just a man.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.557
Now, how about I fix your breakfast?

06:16.975 --> 06:19.019
I don't smell no bacon on.

06:19.686 --> 06:21.105
Is this Sunday?

06:22.064 --> 06:24.149
Monday and Tuesday don't smell at all...

06:24.233 --> 06:26.610
...because Cream of Wheat is instant.

06:27.027 --> 06:28.362
And it ain't Thursday.

06:28.445 --> 06:33.158
I can smell Thursday all the way back
to Wednesday when people put the garbage out.

06:34.201 --> 06:36.787
If it's Sunday, we got to walk in the park.

06:36.870 --> 06:37.871
Sure.

06:38.997 --> 06:39.998
Sid.

06:40.165 --> 06:43.043
Why don't you kids
come for a walk with us?

06:43.127 --> 06:46.046
Sure, Faye. That sounds great.

07:09.153 --> 07:10.654
Get off.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.656
Hola, Mami.

07:13.449 --> 07:14.450
Look.

07:14.950 --> 07:16.368
Smell like money?

07:16.452 --> 07:17.870
Because it is.

07:29.298 --> 07:30.799
He didn't write.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.968
Take it from me. I know about this stuff.

07:33.051 --> 07:34.636
He ain't coming back.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.806
This is the letter
you've been waiting for.

07:39.475 --> 07:42.019
Come on, you're a very rich lady.

07:42.644 --> 07:44.772
Take it! What's wrong with you?

07:44.855 --> 07:46.899
Fresh cash money.

07:47.775 --> 07:49.902
She doesn't believe me.

07:49.985 --> 07:51.904
You could move to Brooklyn.

07:58.452 --> 08:01.246
Here. Buy yourself a new saint.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.540
You can afford it now.

08:11.215 --> 08:12.466
Room service!

08:15.594 --> 08:17.513
It's moving day, Picasso!

08:25.938 --> 08:26.855
Bee.

08:27.231 --> 08:29.274
Don't you even want to count it?

08:29.358 --> 08:31.819
They're paying you to move out.

08:39.743 --> 08:42.162
Hey, doll. He's not home?

08:42.287 --> 08:44.289
How about you move in with me?

08:44.414 --> 08:47.292
This place here, it's falling apart.

08:47.501 --> 08:49.128
No! Don't! Get--

08:58.470 --> 08:59.763
Bee!

09:02.015 --> 09:03.016
Bee?

09:03.851 --> 09:04.893
It's us.

09:07.438 --> 09:09.064
The "knock-knock" boys.

09:11.775 --> 09:13.819
Let's punch it out again, champ.

09:13.902 --> 09:15.028
Round two!

09:24.538 --> 09:26.081
How's the face, man?

09:26.415 --> 09:28.375
You ready for a rematch?

09:29.668 --> 09:31.795
Yesterday, we got rough.

09:32.379 --> 09:34.089
Today, we got money.

09:34.923 --> 09:36.884
Tomorrow, you ain't gone...

09:46.018 --> 09:48.562
There, now you got less to move.

09:49.563 --> 09:51.648
And here's your prize money.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.579
Where are the boys?

10:05.746 --> 10:07.706
I don't hear them playing.

10:08.916 --> 10:09.917
Bobby!

10:10.209 --> 10:11.543
Donald!

10:11.752 --> 10:15.005
Donald's all grown up, Faye.

10:16.548 --> 10:18.884
He has two kids of his own now.

10:19.301 --> 10:21.345
I'm a grandmother, remember?

10:21.428 --> 10:22.179
Yeah.

10:22.262 --> 10:24.973
Now, sit down and finish your coffee.

10:26.225 --> 10:27.810
But where's my Bobby?

10:28.936 --> 10:31.396
Get out of my place, you punks!

10:31.480 --> 10:34.149
Mr. Riley, it's your lucky day!

10:34.233 --> 10:37.861
You, too, pops. Social Security, that's me.

10:38.362 --> 10:41.782
Now, you move out, you go to Miami...

10:41.865 --> 10:45.327
...you sit in the sun, listen to Bing Crosby...

10:45.410 --> 10:47.412
...play checkers, bingo.

10:47.496 --> 10:50.249
- We don't want any trouble, Carlos.
- Hallelujah!

10:50.332 --> 10:53.168
- Don't touch it!
- Too late, man. She already took it.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.630
- You're an angel, Bobby.
- I'm calling the cops!

10:56.713 --> 11:00.092
- Faye, time for your medicine.
- Let Mama give you a pucker.

11:00.175 --> 11:03.428
Never knew you had a mother.
[Buenos dias, seirora!

11:03.512 --> 11:04.972
Shut up, Benny.

11:05.556 --> 11:10.269
You got the idea, right?
You take the money and move out, okay?

11:10.352 --> 11:11.895
Get out of my way!

11:12.396 --> 11:14.731
Let the boy help you.

11:14.815 --> 11:16.984
You never give him a chance. Bobby!

11:17.067 --> 11:18.318
Stop calling me that!

11:18.402 --> 11:20.571
Get them out of here. And you.

11:20.696 --> 11:23.866
Stay away from my wife and this building.

11:23.991 --> 11:27.161
You tell Lacey his money stinks!
You understand?

11:27.536 --> 11:29.872
You kill my head, man.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.458
Money's not a good reason to move?

11:32.541 --> 11:34.460
Okay, here's a good reason.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.801
That's right, abuela. Break it up.

11:43.844 --> 11:45.679
- Come on, Faye.
- Throw him out!

11:45.763 --> 11:47.347
We'll talk about it later.

11:47.431 --> 11:48.348
Frank!

11:49.308 --> 11:50.350
You punks!

11:50.434 --> 11:52.811
Take your hands off of me!

12:03.405 --> 12:05.824
Chill out, pop. You're going to go bald!

12:05.908 --> 12:07.826
You dirty bastards!

12:08.035 --> 12:10.120
Take it easy, pops.

12:10.204 --> 12:11.538
No!

12:31.558 --> 12:33.352
...at fine stores everywhere.

12:33.435 --> 12:35.145
<i>Batteries not included.</i>

12:42.945 --> 12:44.071
Lacey!

12:47.491 --> 12:48.742
No, you don't!

12:48.909 --> 12:51.120
Lacey, you son of a bitch!

12:51.203 --> 12:53.622
You're not getting away with it!

12:56.166 --> 12:59.086
Lacey, open up and face me like a man!

12:59.586 --> 13:01.505
You're not throwing me out!

13:03.924 --> 13:06.468
You really think
that he'd come down here?

13:06.552 --> 13:09.847
Take the money, Mr. Riley. It's our last offer.

13:22.067 --> 13:25.529
This is my place! It's all I got.
I grew up here, for God's sake!

13:25.612 --> 13:27.489
What do you want us to do'?

13:27.573 --> 13:30.284
Arrest them.
Send them up the river for life.

13:30.576 --> 13:34.037
- I'm not scared. I'll testify.
- You know what'll happen.

13:34.121 --> 13:36.915
They'll have 18 witnesses saying
they were somewhere else.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.376
When they get out,
they'll come after you again.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.379
Then patrol the neighborhood,
for crying out loud!

13:44.548 --> 13:46.008
What neighborhood?

13:52.806 --> 13:54.516
What the hell happened?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.726
Mind your own business.

13:55.809 --> 13:59.146
Wait a minute. I live here. Upstairs.

13:59.980 --> 14:02.608
Yeah. I've seen you.
You're in Moskowitz' old place.

14:02.691 --> 14:05.569
Mr. Baylor, do you honestly think...

14:05.652 --> 14:09.156
...I could recommend this building
for historic preservation?

14:09.490 --> 14:12.618
Mrs. Thompson,
it was in much better shape this morning.

14:12.701 --> 14:14.036
I doubt that.

14:14.328 --> 14:16.079
Yeah. Look at the moldings.

14:16.163 --> 14:17.956
Look, look at the cornice.

14:18.832 --> 14:20.292
That's terra cotta.

14:21.168 --> 14:23.086
You don't like ornament. All right.

14:23.170 --> 14:25.422
Step back here and look at those proportions.

14:25.506 --> 14:30.219
- It's got style. It's got dignity.
- There's nothing to preserve.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.805
This one's still here. It can be saved, restored.

14:32.888 --> 14:34.973
We do have a minimum standard...

14:35.057 --> 14:37.768
...that the structure is intact and livable.

14:37.935 --> 14:39.311
You don't even have that.

14:39.394 --> 14:40.854
People live here.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.565
Not for long.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.892
Look, if you're so nervous, I'll fix the door.

15:18.976 --> 15:20.936
It's not the door, Mason.

15:21.019 --> 15:22.104
It's you.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.815
You and your fascination with this place.

15:25.065 --> 15:26.650
What? I like it here.

15:26.817 --> 15:29.653
Of course you do. It's old and depressing.

15:29.820 --> 15:31.280
It's reality!

15:32.573 --> 15:34.116
This is the '80s, Mason.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.577
Nobody likes reality anymore.

15:37.661 --> 15:40.873
Why don't you admit it? It's time to quit.

15:41.206 --> 15:44.168
Thank you very much. How do you know that?

15:44.251 --> 15:45.669
You said so yourself!

15:45.752 --> 15:48.213
You said that you were going nowhere.

15:48.505 --> 15:53.844
You could do analytic deconstruction,
Neo-Geo, hard-edge.

15:53.927 --> 15:57.723
But, no, you've got to be
the Andrew Wyeth of the East Village.

15:59.308 --> 16:03.061
Why don't you go back to your father
and sell vans or rec-Vs...

16:03.145 --> 16:05.272
...or whatever they're called.
-RVs.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.275
But for God's sake, get out of here.

16:09.276 --> 16:13.906
To think that I've been telling my
friends that it's so cool living with an artist!

16:14.531 --> 16:17.451
You never once asked to paint me nude!

16:28.629 --> 16:31.089
Stop right here, man!

16:31.215 --> 16:32.716
All right!

16:36.637 --> 16:37.763
Sorry.

16:45.646 --> 16:47.773
It's okay, Frank. She's here.

16:48.148 --> 16:49.775
She's been helping.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.945
- Give it to me.
- I called Donald.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.030
He made the arrangements.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.574
For what? A funeral?

16:59.284 --> 17:00.911
We're going to Jersey.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.289
It's a home for senior citizens.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.001
You took their money.

17:09.711 --> 17:12.214
You took that bastard's money.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.217
There's cold cereal in here...

17:15.300 --> 17:17.094
...and a Libby's canned fruit...

17:17.176 --> 17:19.221
...but she won't eat the cherries.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.266
And beans. She just loves beans.

17:22.348 --> 17:24.560
Frank, where's our bags?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.645
It's the Love Boat to Cuba.

17:26.728 --> 17:31.233
Shuffleboard and pineapples filled with rum.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.651
You know what they do'?

17:32.734 --> 17:35.487
They put paper umbrellas sticking out the top...

17:35.571 --> 17:38.991
...so when it rains,
it don't thin out the liquor.

17:39.992 --> 17:44.913
And here's her Enderol, four times a day...

17:45.372 --> 17:49.918
...after meals and at bedtime,
and her HydroDIURIL twice a day...

17:50.002 --> 17:51.753
...and don't forget.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.297
I got it.

17:54.089 --> 17:55.841
I won't forget. I'm okay.

17:56.467 --> 17:59.720
Frank, we're tired.

18:00.471 --> 18:03.682
It's not a home anymore.

18:04.558 --> 18:06.560
Say goodbye for us, will you?

18:06.769 --> 18:09.980
Hell, she won't even know you're gone.

18:43.514 --> 18:44.973
Come on out, Faye.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.016
Let's do this.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.392
Where's Muriel?

18:47.851 --> 18:50.187
It smells like cherry cordial, this stuff.

18:50.270 --> 18:51.271
Muriel!

18:52.064 --> 18:55.275
I'm Muriel now. I'm coming in, Faye.

18:55.359 --> 18:57.319
Hold it, I ain't dressed.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.363
Get Frank. Frank!

18:59.822 --> 19:01.115
Yeah'?

19:01.990 --> 19:03.325
Who's that?

19:04.493 --> 19:05.953
It's Frank.

19:06.036 --> 19:07.913
I'm Frank now.

19:08.539 --> 19:09.623
Okay.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.969
Put on the red record.

19:22.302 --> 19:24.012
We haven't got a red record.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.641
Muriel has a red record. Makes the pills go down.

19:27.724 --> 19:28.642
Sure.

19:33.605 --> 19:37.693
- Say "ah."
-No. Muriel and I say "frog."

19:38.068 --> 19:41.822
- Frog.
.Qkay, frog.

19:49.830 --> 19:51.081
My...

20:49.515 --> 20:51.934
I'm going to clean up that cafÃ©, Frank.

20:52.142 --> 20:55.062
I'm going to clean it up right now.

20:58.774 --> 20:59.775
Well...

21:00.818 --> 21:03.070
...maybe first thing in the morning.

21:03.403 --> 21:05.906
You don't have to worry about a thing.

21:06.448 --> 21:07.574
Okay?

21:08.700 --> 21:09.743
Okay-

21:17.626 --> 21:20.170
"Just around the corner

21:20.504 --> 21:23.423
"There's a rainbow in the sky

21:23.924 --> 21:24.925
"So

21:26.885 --> 21:29.680
"Let's have another cup of coffee

21:30.055 --> 21:33.308
"And let's have another piece of pie"

21:37.271 --> 21:39.356
Did we miss the sunset?

22:24.026 --> 22:25.152
Please...

22:26.195 --> 22:27.446
...somebody...

22:29.156 --> 22:30.449
...help us.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.363
Frank.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.241
Where's the goddamn toaster?

30:04.653 --> 30:06.613
Good morning. Island Manor.

30:07.614 --> 30:09.992
Can I help you? Hello?

30:10.576 --> 30:11.660
Hello ?

30:15.414 --> 30:17.541
Faye, what is this?

30:44.234 --> 30:46.695
Come on, Tommy, slow down!

30:47.196 --> 30:48.071
No.

30:49.114 --> 30:51.116
Wait a minute! Those are my pictures!

30:51.200 --> 30:52.826
Wait! Would you stop?

30:52.910 --> 30:54.578
Stop! Just wait!

30:55.871 --> 30:56.872
God.

30:57.247 --> 30:59.374
Today they collect the garbage...

31:17.267 --> 31:18.310
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:18.393 --> 31:21.355
It's all right. It's me, 3B.

31:22.564 --> 31:24.024
Someone was in my room.

31:24.108 --> 31:25.818
Yeah, me too.

31:26.193 --> 31:28.195
I think we got elves.

31:28.278 --> 31:29.905
- Good morning.
- Hi.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.698
- Who are you?
- 3C.

31:32.074 --> 31:34.159
The old Grandey place.

31:34.243 --> 31:37.704
Say, have either of you seen my...

31:38.914 --> 31:41.458
Come on, dear. Don't be shy.

31:41.959 --> 31:43.335
Dear, come on.

31:43.418 --> 31:45.337
Let me get a nice big bolt for you.

31:45.421 --> 31:48.090
You're tired of nails. Here.

31:49.591 --> 31:51.051
You want some paperclips?

31:51.135 --> 31:52.845
Come on. Don't move.

31:52.928 --> 31:55.597
Come on, Faye. Time to go back downstairs.

31:55.764 --> 31:58.600
I'm feeding them. They like this stuff.

31:59.643 --> 32:00.561
Here.

32:03.230 --> 32:05.566
Our son kept birds.

32:05.649 --> 32:08.318
You know, pigeons.

32:09.778 --> 32:12.531
Please, Faye. Don't do this.

32:12.739 --> 32:14.658
Not now, okay?

32:16.827 --> 32:19.163
That's my frying pan.

32:20.414 --> 32:21.415
What?

32:22.207 --> 32:24.001
- Nothing.
-Go ahead. Tell him.

32:24.084 --> 32:27.838
- Nothing. It's not important.
-That's her pan and my coffeepot.

32:30.174 --> 32:32.176
Come on. Come on.

32:33.469 --> 32:35.429
No more pigeons, hon.

32:35.637 --> 32:37.723
It's time to stop.

32:38.974 --> 32:40.726
I said stop that!

32:40.893 --> 32:41.727
Frank.

32:41.810 --> 32:43.145
My God, Faye.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.314
<i>You went into these people's apartments?</i>

32:45.397 --> 32:47.858
Not me, them, the little guys.

32:47.941 --> 32:51.195
Faye, I need you to be with me now.

32:51.278 --> 32:53.322
I need you to be here.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.699
I'm here, Papa. I'm with you.

32:56.116 --> 32:58.035
Now, what else did you take?

32:58.285 --> 33:00.287
I told you, nothing.

33:00.621 --> 33:03.123
-It's the little guys.
-Skip that.

33:03.832 --> 33:05.209
What about this?

33:05.501 --> 33:07.586
Where did you get a new picture?

33:08.087 --> 33:10.297
It's not new, it's fixed.

33:11.006 --> 33:12.591
Fixed like new?

33:12.674 --> 33:15.511
- They did a good job.
-Who did?

33:16.470 --> 33:17.846
I ain't saying.

33:17.930 --> 33:19.264
Goddamn it, Faye!

33:19.348 --> 33:20.766
It's okay. No harm done.

33:20.849 --> 33:22.392
It could be giant rats.

33:22.476 --> 33:24.478
Yeah, from Brooklyn, you know.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.113
That was no rat.

33:34.196 --> 33:35.239
What was it?

33:35.322 --> 33:37.741
Who in his right mind stands in a puddle...

33:37.825 --> 33:40.369
...and sticks a fork in a wall socket?

33:40.786 --> 33:43.497
Come on, get back. All of you.

33:45.582 --> 33:46.792
Come on, now.

33:46.875 --> 33:49.169
There, wait there. Wait there.

33:53.549 --> 33:54.675
Here.

33:55.509 --> 33:56.802
They're shy.

34:54.610 --> 34:55.860
They're the fixers.

34:55.944 --> 34:57.654
They like to fix things.

34:57.821 --> 34:59.531
They have that knack.

35:00.699 --> 35:03.118
Dance me around, Papa.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.829
Oh, come on, you kids.

35:06.663 --> 35:09.625
Put a little Fred Astaire into it.

35:58.173 --> 35:59.842
No, they're not toys.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.844
You can't buy them at Macy's.

36:01.969 --> 36:04.096
The Army told me to call you.

36:05.180 --> 36:06.974
Are you missing anything...

36:07.057 --> 36:10.227
...in the way of experimental aircraft?

36:10.310 --> 36:12.646
Not a word, not even in the Post.

36:12.729 --> 36:15.941
Well, they're robots, right?
They're autogiros or smart bombs.

36:16.024 --> 36:17.568
They're microchip hovercraft.

36:17.651 --> 36:20.779
They're spaceships.
You can tell by looking at them.

36:20.863 --> 36:21.738
Spaceships?

36:21.822 --> 36:24.324
Sure, from a very small planet.

36:25.492 --> 36:26.660
Very small.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.025
Maybe this is all a dream.

36:58.108 --> 37:01.236
If this is a dream, which one of us is having it?

37:02.654 --> 37:03.947
Don't look at me.

37:04.031 --> 37:07.117
I stopped dreaming along time ago.

37:24.802 --> 37:25.844
I'll talk to it.

37:25.928 --> 37:27.805
You better be careful.

37:33.811 --> 37:34.853
Stop!

37:47.950 --> 37:50.577
Welcome to America.

37:52.955 --> 37:55.624
You should try some Spanish on him.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.627
<i>(; Habfa esp afi o! ?</i>

38:00.254 --> 38:01.922
gEstÃ©n perdidos?

38:03.257 --> 38:05.342
Don't hurt anybody, okay?

38:06.385 --> 38:07.886
B reakfast.

38:10.848 --> 38:12.808
Sit down, everybody.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.852
Don't let it get cold.

38:14.935 --> 38:16.937
I made candy omelets.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.314
That looks delicious, Mrs. Riley.

38:22.484 --> 38:25.571
Look. It's plugged itself in.

38:31.118 --> 38:34.163
Is that why you're here?

38:43.130 --> 38:45.174
Okay, that's it.

38:45.257 --> 38:47.968
I'm gonna call the cops and make them come.

38:48.635 --> 38:50.053
I heard that.

38:50.137 --> 38:52.681
You need cops, Picasso? Come on. Call a cop.

38:52.765 --> 38:55.350
- Bobby.
- Lady, my name's not Bobby.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.560
Excuse me.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.062
Robert. Mr. B.

38:59.146 --> 39:00.606
Shut up!

39:01.023 --> 39:03.901
I saw downstairs.
Who's been cleaning up after me?

39:05.486 --> 39:06.653
Who?

39:09.865 --> 39:12.159
Whoever threw that is ruined, man.

39:12.242 --> 39:13.827
Hospitalized.

39:44.024 --> 39:46.568
What the hell is this'?

40:03.085 --> 40:06.380
Whoever's in there, you got big trouble, man.

40:20.936 --> 40:21.937
Carlos.

40:22.938 --> 40:25.566
Actually, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

41:07.024 --> 41:10.235
Carlos, where are you going, man?
Let's talk this over!

41:10.402 --> 41:12.070
Don't forget to write!

41:19.161 --> 41:23.040
Okay, easy now, little guy. That's right.

41:23.207 --> 41:26.460
I just want to check for that label that says,
"Made in the USA."

41:26.543 --> 41:29.838
No, don't. You'll queer our luck.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.883
That little guy is the golden goose.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.362
It serves you right.

41:56.573 --> 41:59.159
We apologize. He didn't mean to pry.

41:59.243 --> 42:01.120
He was just being scientific.

42:01.203 --> 42:03.747
"GE." This says "GE."

42:04.039 --> 42:07.209
This is, was, my coffeepot.

42:07.751 --> 42:09.628
Looks like it's been percolated.

42:09.711 --> 42:11.338
Who are they, Frank'?

42:11.505 --> 42:14.466
What is so special about our roof?

42:16.051 --> 42:17.761
Maybe it was me.

42:20.013 --> 42:22.099
What do you mean you?

42:23.809 --> 42:25.227
Me and Faye...

42:26.520 --> 42:27.980
...we needed help.

42:30.607 --> 42:34.653
You think that they're here because of you?

42:36.029 --> 42:40.826
The quickest way to end a miracle
is to ask it why it is...

42:42.327 --> 42:44.955
...or what it wants.

42:53.589 --> 42:55.174
What is your name, dear'?

42:55.257 --> 42:58.218
- Marisa.
-Marisa. Boy, my memory.

42:58.302 --> 43:02.181
It's like the Navy.
Coming and going, coming and going.

43:02.973 --> 43:05.601
Here's Bobby's Iittlejammies.

43:05.684 --> 43:08.270
I bet there's even a few diapers in here.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.773
How old is your son, Mrs. Riley?

43:11.690 --> 43:12.858
Bobby?

43:14.359 --> 43:15.903
Let me see.

43:16.695 --> 43:18.655
He just had a birthday.

43:19.490 --> 43:21.825
I've got to think.

43:23.118 --> 43:25.120
He's got his father's ears.

43:26.705 --> 43:30.459
He and Frank don't get along so good.

43:31.418 --> 43:34.671
Frank's got a terrible temper, you know.

43:38.258 --> 43:40.511
You're going to love being a mother.

43:41.428 --> 43:43.347
Faye, come here, quick!

44:35.941 --> 44:38.569
- What are they doing'?
- Can't you tell?

44:52.499 --> 44:54.418
She's going to get hungry.

44:55.502 --> 44:57.171
Take it away!

45:07.014 --> 45:08.307
It's too short!

45:08.849 --> 45:10.893
- Any more?
- That's it.

45:11.310 --> 45:13.645
Come on, Frank. They're starving.

45:16.815 --> 45:19.318
Well, what do you know'? Thanks, Harry.

45:20.652 --> 45:22.446
I saw you fight.

45:22.821 --> 45:25.365
Harry Noble, the human locomotive.

45:26.867 --> 45:29.787
Come on, Harry, say something. Talk to me.

45:32.164 --> 45:34.249
Come on, Frank. Get on with it.

45:35.125 --> 45:36.668
A tremendous right.

45:37.127 --> 45:38.295
Tremendous.

45:39.088 --> 45:40.547
Never says a word.

45:40.631 --> 45:44.343
Just watches TV. Loves the commercials.

45:46.804 --> 45:48.472
It's all we got.

45:50.849 --> 45:52.684
Come on. Take it.

45:53.352 --> 45:56.730
It's okay. We're neighbors.

46:00.067 --> 46:02.319
- Doesn't trust us.
-Yeah.

46:26.051 --> 46:29.471
Harry Noble. I used to bet on him.

46:29.763 --> 46:32.891
He had a hell of a right. You should've seen him.

46:54.580 --> 46:57.750
Look out. Flying pot.

46:58.584 --> 47:00.878
Ghost in the garbage!

47:01.170 --> 47:02.838
Shut up, Benny.

47:03.255 --> 47:07.050
Mama's whole kitchen coming to get you.

47:07.134 --> 47:09.136
I said shut up, man!

47:10.637 --> 47:12.222
Lighten up.

47:12.431 --> 47:14.933
We got plans for those people.

47:15.392 --> 47:16.852
And you know what?

47:17.770 --> 47:20.856
Those people are making plans on their own.

47:20.939 --> 47:23.025
They got something hooked up.

47:24.526 --> 47:27.738
Man, they're getting organized, and look at us.

47:29.531 --> 47:30.949
Somebody's helping them.

47:31.033 --> 47:33.702
Somebody's bringing them together.

47:33.827 --> 47:37.998
- Yo, Carlos, I see someone.
- Give me that!

47:46.298 --> 47:48.133
Wave to your mother.

48:05.067 --> 48:06.860
There you are.

48:07.986 --> 48:11.698
You're a lucky one. She's a darling girl.

48:33.804 --> 48:35.556
Are you superstitious?

48:35.764 --> 48:37.599
I'm getting there.

48:38.100 --> 48:39.226
Well...

48:41.520 --> 48:43.605
...I'm not superstitious...

48:44.773 --> 48:48.485
...but I was thinking about these things
and why they came.

48:49.570 --> 48:50.779
And...

48:53.532 --> 48:55.742
This will really sound silly, but...

48:55.826 --> 48:59.079
...it's like they were watching or listening.

49:00.164 --> 49:03.584
- You think they're here because of you.
- Yes!

49:08.881 --> 49:10.716
So when's the baby due?

49:11.175 --> 49:13.302
Two or three more months. I'm not sure.

49:13.385 --> 49:15.596
You're not sure'? What does the doctor say'?

49:15.679 --> 49:18.140
- I haven't been to the doctor.
-That's crazy.

49:18.223 --> 49:20.601
- I feel fine.
-You got to take care of yourself.

49:20.684 --> 49:24.062
My boyfriend's coming.
He's going to take care of me.

49:24.146 --> 49:26.356
- Your boyfriend.
-Hector.

49:26.523 --> 49:29.234
He's a musician, so he travels around a lot...

49:29.401 --> 49:30.986
...different places.

49:32.362 --> 49:35.282
So, what about you? No more girlfriend'?

49:35.365 --> 49:37.743
No, she got smart.

49:38.827 --> 49:41.038
Don't say that. She'll be back.

49:41.121 --> 49:43.499
- Yeah'? Why should she?
- Because.

49:44.416 --> 49:45.834
You're an artist.

49:46.877 --> 49:49.171
Oh, God, an artist.

49:50.464 --> 49:53.175
- Can I come in?
- No.

49:53.967 --> 49:57.429
- I make a very artistic cup of coffee.
- No...

49:58.097 --> 50:00.557
I want to go to bed to sleep.

50:01.683 --> 50:03.393
I have to take a nap.

50:06.146 --> 50:07.940
Did I say something wrong'?

50:09.274 --> 50:13.070
No, it was nice talking to you.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

50:14.154 --> 50:15.197
Okay.

50:16.406 --> 50:17.658
See you tomorrow.

50:21.203 --> 50:22.621
Mason!

50:25.082 --> 50:26.959
Maybe it was for you.

50:27.209 --> 50:28.210
What?

50:28.627 --> 50:31.296
Maybe they're here, those things...

50:31.630 --> 50:33.090
...because of you.

50:45.352 --> 50:48.730
- Give me back my camera, man.
- Go chase phenomena, man.

50:48.814 --> 50:52.109
- Bust it up, Benny!
- Want to do business? Severance pay.

50:52.317 --> 50:54.736
Want to see a strange object?

50:56.488 --> 50:57.948
There you go, fool!

51:24.183 --> 51:25.601
Frank!

51:30.481 --> 51:31.899
What's happening?

51:39.281 --> 51:42.117
- Tonight's the night.
- Already?

52:01.595 --> 52:04.556
The fuses! She blew the fuses.

52:14.525 --> 52:15.943
There it is.

52:51.145 --> 52:53.897
- How's she doing'?
-it happened.

52:55.232 --> 52:56.984
I'm a grandmother.

53:13.083 --> 53:14.668
It's twins!

53:15.210 --> 53:17.087
This calls for cigars.

53:17.963 --> 53:19.882
- You got any cigars?
- Cigars?

53:20.674 --> 53:22.092
This is history.

53:23.969 --> 53:26.680
Do you realize what's going on here?

53:27.347 --> 53:29.975
Machines that reproduce themselves.

53:31.226 --> 53:35.105
Spare parts with intelligence. Living hardware.

53:39.777 --> 53:43.781
I don't know how you got here,
or why you picked us...

53:43.864 --> 53:47.451
...but we pledge allegiance...

53:47.993 --> 53:50.913
...to honor and protect you...

53:53.040 --> 53:55.250
...in sickness and in health...

53:55.334 --> 53:57.044
...in rain and sleet...

53:57.127 --> 54:00.047
...in the best of times and the worst of times...

54:01.256 --> 54:03.383
...so help us, God.

54:03.467 --> 54:04.718
What's that?

54:33.747 --> 54:35.916
Batteries not included.

55:07.990 --> 55:10.951
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

55:11.743 --> 55:14.079
âHe Ieadeth me beside the still waters."

55:14.163 --> 55:15.164
Faye.

55:15.581 --> 55:18.792
Faye, this has gone far enough.
Come on. Get up.

55:18.876 --> 55:21.128
Got to accept it, Frank. It's over.

55:21.587 --> 55:23.005
Poor little soul.

55:23.338 --> 55:26.550
What soul? Mrs. Riley.

55:27.050 --> 55:29.219
Mrs. Riley, it's a chunk of metal.

55:29.344 --> 55:32.598
It's nine ounces of canned goods,
most of it from your apartment.

55:32.681 --> 55:35.434
Now we can really look inside--
Wait a minute.

55:35.517 --> 55:38.729
Last night you were so excited.
Now they're chunks of metal?

55:38.812 --> 55:42.107
You don't bury the most advanced,
self-perpetuating...

55:42.191 --> 55:45.569
...machine-tooled,
flying clockwork known to man.

55:46.028 --> 55:47.362
Mrs. Riley, please!

55:47.446 --> 55:51.533
You know, that little tiny, helpless spare part.

55:52.117 --> 55:54.536
It got born, and it never had a chance.

55:54.995 --> 55:58.123
It could happen to anyone.
What's the matter with you?

55:59.333 --> 56:00.626
What did I say'?

56:00.751 --> 56:03.462
Marisa, wait a minute!

56:10.469 --> 56:12.888
Hey! What are you doing?

56:15.849 --> 56:18.727
Marisa, wait a minute! Wait up! Would you stop?

56:18.811 --> 56:22.022
- Wait a minute!
-I'm worried about the baby, okay?

56:22.272 --> 56:26.193
I can't help it, but don't let it bother you.
It's not your problem.

56:26.318 --> 56:28.946
Harry? Where are you going?

56:29.029 --> 56:30.114
Stop him!

56:30.239 --> 56:32.074
Oh, God, what is it?

56:32.199 --> 56:33.909
Harry, wait a minute!

56:37.079 --> 56:37.996
Harry!

56:40.707 --> 56:42.126
Harry, please!

56:45.587 --> 56:49.091
Champ, what are you doing'?
Come on, open up.

56:50.467 --> 56:54.513
Let's talk about this. You don't have
to say anything. I'll do all the talking.

56:54.596 --> 56:56.765
What are you going to do with that thing?

57:16.827 --> 57:18.620
Gary, Glen.

57:18.704 --> 57:21.331
Smells good, pop. You back in business?

57:23.250 --> 57:24.752
What does it look like?

57:47.691 --> 57:51.069
Ham sand, Miracle Whip, Canadian on the side.

57:51.153 --> 57:52.571
Medium rare!

57:53.322 --> 57:57.201
Two over easy, English, no toast,
and hold the spuds.

57:57.576 --> 57:58.911
Burger up.

58:01.955 --> 58:04.625
Boy, I'm sure going to hate
to crunch this place up.

58:04.708 --> 58:06.126
Thank you, ma'am.

58:06.543 --> 58:08.378
What's this, April fool'?

58:16.512 --> 58:20.015
He's working on it. It's his first day, okay?

58:22.768 --> 58:24.645
Hey, pal.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.689
Like this.

58:28.315 --> 58:29.983
Remember'?

58:47.584 --> 58:49.002
Burger up.

58:54.258 --> 58:56.343
Now, that's more like it.

59:01.014 --> 59:02.099
Look at this.

59:02.182 --> 59:04.810
Lefty, hey! Give me that ketchup.

59:04.893 --> 59:06.979
- This one?
- No, the other one.

59:07.396 --> 59:09.022
Oh, yeah, here you go.

59:09.606 --> 59:10.774
Thanks.

59:19.741 --> 59:20.826
What?

59:22.244 --> 59:24.496
What do you mean, "What?"

59:50.272 --> 59:52.232
Hey, Frank. Guess whatl did.

59:52.816 --> 59:55.736
- What now?
-I named the little guys.

59:56.028 --> 59:59.406
- Flotsam and Jetsam. Isn't that cute?
-Yeah, cute.

59:59.782 --> 01:00:03.619
- Be nice, Papa.
-I'm always nice. I've got a kitchen to run.

01:00:03.702 --> 01:00:06.330
If you're not nice, you'll drive them away.

01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:08.123
Meaning what?

01:00:08.707 --> 01:00:10.709
I like being a family again.

01:00:10.793 --> 01:00:14.546
Just you and me, and Flotsam and Jetsam,
and Bobby.

01:00:21.678 --> 01:00:23.263
Okay, Faye.

01:00:25.224 --> 01:00:26.475
Okay-

01:01:01.176 --> 01:01:04.054
Carlos. Is this what you're talking about?

01:01:04.346 --> 01:01:06.682
It's full ofjunk. It's a storage shed, you idiot.

01:01:06.765 --> 01:01:10.602
No, it's not.
It's full of ghosts, or spirits, or something.

01:01:10.727 --> 01:01:13.397
They're just trying to make me look bad.

01:01:14.648 --> 01:01:18.861
You don't need ghosts for that, Carlos.
Your time's running out, my friend.

01:01:26.076 --> 01:01:29.621
Hey, I'm hungry.
How about a little service around here?

01:01:29.913 --> 01:01:33.000
What's great about a place
you can't even get a menu?

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:35.127
You want a menu, pal?

01:01:35.377 --> 01:01:38.172
What for?
You're going to get the special of the day.

01:01:38.255 --> 01:01:41.383
You shouldn't even be in here.
I'm going to report all you guys.

01:01:41.467 --> 01:01:43.886
Bobby, have you had your lunch'?

01:01:44.011 --> 01:01:46.513
Wait a minute. Excuse me.

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:48.891
There.

01:01:50.267 --> 01:01:52.936
Now, what about you? You want to sleep over'?

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.398
Why don't you call your mommy
and tell her where you'll be?

01:01:56.774 --> 01:01:59.693
No, thanks, Mrs. Riley. I can't tonight.

01:02:00.152 --> 01:02:02.362
Bobby, you want to go out and play?

01:02:02.446 --> 01:02:05.073
You ain't going nowhere
unless you eat something.

01:02:05.157 --> 01:02:07.451
You look terrible. Thin. Here.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:11.747
- Come on, lady. You got to stop this.
-Eat, for the love of Mike.

01:02:11.914 --> 01:02:13.499
You're just like your father.

01:02:13.582 --> 01:02:17.044
I don't know nothing about my father,
and I don't want to know.

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:20.130
Don't say that. He loves you.

01:02:21.882 --> 01:02:25.052
Lady, I'm not who you thinkl am.

01:02:25.135 --> 01:02:27.137
Of course you are, my little munchkin.

01:02:27.221 --> 01:02:30.057
I'm learning how Lacey works,
how this city works.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.600
It's my way out of here.

01:02:31.683 --> 01:02:34.520
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere.

01:02:35.437 --> 01:02:38.148
I'm smart, I'm talented.

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:40.901
- I get ideas all the time.
-Of course you do.

01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:46.156
Why don't you talk to your father
tonight at dinner?

01:02:48.117 --> 01:02:49.910
I'll cook a ham.

01:02:50.244 --> 01:02:53.247
- You're inviting me for dinner?
-You'd love my ham.

01:02:55.874 --> 01:02:58.168
Oh, my goodness, is that a smile?

01:02:59.878 --> 01:03:02.423
I think I just saw a smile.

01:03:06.468 --> 01:03:09.596
Oh, not here, honey. Back inside on the counter.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:14.435
- What the hell is that?
-It's them. The little guys.

01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:15.811
My little munchkins.

01:03:15.894 --> 01:03:18.772
Stay away from me. You're not fooling anybody.

01:03:19.356 --> 01:03:21.024
Crazy, my ass.

01:04:51.573 --> 01:04:54.118
Marisa, open up.

01:04:58.205 --> 01:05:03.043
Hi. Listen, you are going
to stop worrying about that baby.

01:05:03.419 --> 01:05:04.795
Step aside.

01:05:09.883 --> 01:05:11.343
Whole-wheat bread.

01:05:11.593 --> 01:05:16.557
Lots of milk. We've got whole milk,
half-fat, nonfat.

01:05:17.057 --> 01:05:18.434
One baby book.

01:05:18.517 --> 01:05:21.645
What are you doing'?
You don't have to take care of me.

01:05:21.812 --> 01:05:24.273
I got you these for that special yen.

01:05:46.295 --> 01:05:48.881
You made me an art collector.

01:05:49.506 --> 01:05:52.342
He's a new guy, very talented.

01:05:56.263 --> 01:05:58.098
What does this one say to you?

01:05:59.016 --> 01:06:00.726
That's my favorite.

01:06:02.478 --> 01:06:06.023
It's a guy standing in the sun.

01:06:07.191 --> 01:06:10.277
- Sun'? What sun? There's no sun.
- Oh, yes, there is.

01:06:10.986 --> 01:06:13.489
See, all you see now is the shadows.

01:06:13.864 --> 01:06:17.826
See, if he moves two steps in any direction,
he'll be in the sunlight.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.872
I've been looking at it a lot,
you know, because it's art.

01:06:21.955 --> 01:06:23.957
You got to keep looking at it.

01:06:26.168 --> 01:06:27.211
What?

01:06:28.462 --> 01:06:30.255
What are you staring at?

01:06:38.013 --> 01:06:39.389
He's on his way.

01:06:55.823 --> 01:06:59.368
- Carlos?
- Yo, Mr. Kovacs.

01:06:59.535 --> 01:07:02.496
- Carlos, what are you doing here?
-I want one more chance.

01:07:02.579 --> 01:07:06.917
I got to have this job, you understand?
You've been happy up 'till now, right?

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:08.168
Mr. Lacey.

01:07:08.293 --> 01:07:10.254
- This is...
- I know who he is.

01:07:11.296 --> 01:07:15.968
- Mr. Lacey. I gave them the money.
-And they sent it right back.

01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:18.387
Come here.

01:07:21.598 --> 01:07:25.561
I got a commitment to have this entire block
down to grade level.

01:07:29.773 --> 01:07:31.483
Grade level. (,Comprende?

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:35.070
I can do it, sir. There's no problem, I assure you.

01:07:35.195 --> 01:07:38.490
In three days, permits expire
and legal options go out the window.

01:07:38.574 --> 01:07:42.327
- I know about options, lot assemblies--
-Interest rates are going back up...

01:07:42.411 --> 01:07:44.163
...and I'm paying a demolition crew...

01:07:44.246 --> 01:07:47.708
...to sit around in a restaurant
they're supposed to be knocking down.

01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:50.335
Tonight. I'll have them out by tonight.

01:07:50.586 --> 01:07:53.922
You've had your chance, kid.
I've made other arrangements.

01:08:00.012 --> 01:08:03.182
Don't you worry, Mr. Lacey.
I'm going to do it for you.

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:22.868
What?

01:08:22.951 --> 01:08:26.705
- What's so funny'?
- You. Your face. You look so serious.

01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:29.792
Well, this is serious.

01:08:30.417 --> 01:08:32.336
I'm looking at the real you.

01:08:33.879 --> 01:08:35.296
And what do you see'?

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:40.594
What do I see? I see a mysterious counterplay
of light and dark.

01:08:43.388 --> 01:08:46.308
Hey! All right, great. Give me that back.

01:08:47.643 --> 01:08:49.478
Those aren't toys, you guys.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.898
Put that down. You guys, come on.
Stop playing with that.

01:08:53.023 --> 01:08:54.524
0h. my God!

01:08:55.484 --> 01:08:56.944
That's not fair.

01:08:57.027 --> 01:09:00.029
What's not fair about it?
I used my imagination, that's all.

01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:01.698
And my X-ray goggles.

01:09:01.823 --> 01:09:04.368
Hey, would you paint some clothes on her'?

01:09:05.118 --> 01:09:06.453
Hey!

01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:14.420
iOye, Marisa!

01:09:15.962 --> 01:09:17.464
Vamos a gozar.

01:09:18.465 --> 01:09:20.300
Vamos a gozar. Hey!

01:09:21.176 --> 01:09:22.636
Vamos a posar.

01:09:24.595 --> 01:09:26.014
Hector.

01:09:39.194 --> 01:09:40.529
Hector.

01:10:21.487 --> 01:10:22.488
Thanks.

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:36.752
Whatever happened to General Eisenhower'?

01:10:37.044 --> 01:10:39.963
You hardly see a word about him anymore.

01:12:17.269 --> 01:12:21.190
It's the little fellow, alive and kicking.

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:42.711
Harry.

01:12:43.295 --> 01:12:44.755
You did that?

01:12:47.007 --> 01:12:49.426
"We bring good things to life."

01:13:14.535 --> 01:13:17.246
You know what happens when birds learn to fly.

01:13:18.038 --> 01:13:19.957
They leave the nest!

01:13:47.109 --> 01:13:48.819
Marisa?

01:14:10.591 --> 01:14:14.762
Carlos, you semi-illiterate,
Fascist sociopath!

01:14:17.598 --> 01:14:20.601
You were gone so long, I was leaving you a note.

01:14:25.814 --> 01:14:28.442
-"Dear Mason."
-Not out loud.

01:14:28.692 --> 01:14:30.194
That's all it says.

01:14:30.861 --> 01:14:33.030
Well, I didn't know what to write.

01:14:34.615 --> 01:14:36.658
What are you doing with my paintings?

01:14:36.742 --> 01:14:39.119
Your paintings. Just because you go...

01:14:39.745 --> 01:14:41.955
Where's Hector and the all-stars?

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.502
They're on their way to Chicago.

01:14:46.585 --> 01:14:48.045
Oh, that son of a bitch.

01:14:48.128 --> 01:14:51.256
Look, he got a good job. It's good pay.

01:14:51.673 --> 01:14:54.676
- It's a break, really.
- But what about you?

01:14:58.806 --> 01:15:00.933
I told him to go.

01:15:07.773 --> 01:15:10.192
Well, you need somebody to draw, right?

01:16:58.634 --> 01:17:00.302
Can you believe this?

01:17:01.428 --> 01:17:03.138
I got it. I got it.

01:17:05.849 --> 01:17:09.603
- This must be Carlos.
- No, don't kid yourself.

01:17:09.686 --> 01:17:12.940
This isn't Carlos. This is Lacey.

01:18:00.863 --> 01:18:03.866
Carlos! You murdering son of a bitch!

01:18:03.949 --> 01:18:05.409
Get out of my way.

01:18:07.286 --> 01:18:08.912
Not this time, pal.

01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:15.377
- My guys are coming any minute.
- Yeah, sure they are.

01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:40.861
What's this?

01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:42.863
Everybody together?

01:18:43.197 --> 01:18:45.324
What, you ganging up on me?

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.545
Oh, yeah? Come on.

01:18:59.171 --> 01:19:00.589
Come on!

01:19:04.802 --> 01:19:06.929
You should stay retired, champ.

01:19:24.988 --> 01:19:26.990
Stop them, Frank. Stop them!

01:19:27.574 --> 01:19:29.368
I'll take door number one.

01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:33.872
Bobby!

01:19:34.998 --> 01:19:35.999
Bobby!

01:19:36.834 --> 01:19:40.212
Goddamn it, he's not Bobby. He's just a punk.

01:19:40.295 --> 01:19:42.131
- Let me go. He's hurt.
-Faye--

01:19:42.214 --> 01:19:43.966
What's the matter with you?

01:19:44.049 --> 01:19:48.303
- Bobby is dead. He's dead. You hear?
-No!

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:52.015
You wish he was dead.

01:19:53.809 --> 01:19:54.810
Faye.

01:19:55.185 --> 01:19:58.480
All you do is yell at him
and make him feel he's not good enough.

01:19:58.564 --> 01:20:00.399
Well, look who's talking.

01:20:00.524 --> 01:20:03.652
Why do you think he's buying that car?
To get away from you!

01:20:03.736 --> 01:20:06.029
We're going to lose him, and it's all your fault.

01:20:06.113 --> 01:20:07.531
You hate him!

01:20:24.715 --> 01:20:25.758
Flotsam!

01:20:26.049 --> 01:20:27.050
Jetsam.

01:20:28.302 --> 01:20:29.303
Flotsam.

01:20:30.554 --> 01:20:31.513
Jetsam.

01:20:31.597 --> 01:20:32.723
Come on out.

01:20:34.266 --> 01:20:35.225
Don't hide.

01:20:35.309 --> 01:20:37.853
- No one's going to hurt you.
- It'll be okay.

01:20:37.936 --> 01:20:38.854
Flotsam.

01:20:38.937 --> 01:20:39.855
Jetsam.

01:20:39.938 --> 01:20:42.107
- She's scared.
- Come on, you guys.

01:20:42.357 --> 01:20:46.737
- Where are you hiding?
- Mason, they're not here.

01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:29.113
What about Times Square, all the electricity?

01:21:29.196 --> 01:21:30.739
Or the subway?

01:21:37.079 --> 01:21:39.373
Okay, I need more line.

01:21:46.422 --> 01:21:49.174
- Now what?
-Now we go home.

01:21:50.008 --> 01:21:51.176
It's over.

01:21:52.553 --> 01:21:54.471
Harry, what are you doing'?

01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:57.891
Harry, what the hell are you doing?

01:21:57.975 --> 01:21:59.017
Harry!

01:23:37.533 --> 01:23:39.660
What in the name of God?

01:25:27.935 --> 01:25:32.356
Okay. Go out. Go find your babies.

01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:04.430
You are a genius, Harry, 100 percent.

01:26:05.889 --> 01:26:08.350
"Don't leave home without it."

01:26:30.539 --> 01:26:32.458
He's back together.

01:26:47.723 --> 01:26:50.350
Mason, do something. Talk to them.

01:26:50.434 --> 01:26:54.605
- What should I say'? It was an accident?
- We didn't do anything.

01:26:54.730 --> 01:26:56.523
It was Carlos.

01:27:03.197 --> 01:27:05.991
Wait! Give us another chance!

01:27:18.087 --> 01:27:19.630
Harry.

01:27:20.714 --> 01:27:22.424
Let him go, Harry.

01:27:32.476 --> 01:27:33.936
Let him go.

01:27:55.916 --> 01:27:57.626
What the hell you doing'?

01:27:58.794 --> 01:28:03.340
- Are you having a party or what?
-No party, kid. There's no one home.

01:28:03.882 --> 01:28:05.342
That's because of me.

01:28:05.426 --> 01:28:08.595
They won't stay if there's no water and electricity.

01:28:08.971 --> 01:28:10.347
What are you doing here?

01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:13.350
This is my building. I did thejob. I cleared it.

01:28:14.935 --> 01:28:16.854
You're going to burn the place down.

01:28:16.937 --> 01:28:20.441
Man, that's bullshit.
This is my building, man. They're moving out.

01:28:20.524 --> 01:28:23.277
What do you want from me?
It's too late, all right?

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.611
What about me?

01:28:24.903 --> 01:28:26.196
What about you?

01:28:27.823 --> 01:28:30.826
Okay. If it's got to burn down...

01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:33.620
...I'm going to burn it.

01:28:34.413 --> 01:28:37.291
Hey, what are you...
You schmuck, that's evidence.

01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:44.214
It's got to look normal. Regular!

01:28:44.298 --> 01:28:47.176
Who cares? We're burning the place, right?

01:28:47.259 --> 01:28:48.677
Let's burn it.

01:29:02.066 --> 01:29:04.234
Sloppy. Sloppy.

01:29:05.486 --> 01:29:06.904
Don't you want to see'?

01:29:06.987 --> 01:29:09.531
When you do good work,
don't you like to watch it?

01:29:09.615 --> 01:29:12.534
What do you want?
We should be across town by now.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:16.246
Bobby, you let him go
and get up here this instant.

01:29:20.334 --> 01:29:22.961
You said the place was empty.

01:29:23.045 --> 01:29:27.716
- You got to shut it off, man.
-Too late. It's too late.

01:29:27.883 --> 01:29:31.095
Want to get us both killed?
It's going to blow any minute!

01:29:31.178 --> 01:29:34.098
Just get in there. Get in there!

01:29:42.398 --> 01:29:45.859
My leg! My knee! You broke my knee!

01:29:45.984 --> 01:29:47.111
That's bull, man.

01:29:47.194 --> 01:29:51.323
- Get up. Get up!
-I can't walk.

01:29:51.448 --> 01:29:55.911
I'll tell you where it is.
Fourth floor, storeroom, in the back.

01:29:56.286 --> 01:29:57.621
Where'?

01:29:58.038 --> 01:29:59.415
The storeroom.

01:29:59.748 --> 01:30:02.126
Now, go! You got two minutes.

01:30:14.221 --> 01:30:18.016
- Lady, come on!
-All right, all right.

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:20.018
Supper's nearly ready.

01:30:21.228 --> 01:30:24.523
Go wash your hands and face
and go sit down at the table.

01:30:24.648 --> 01:30:27.693
See, I knew you'd be coming.

01:30:28.736 --> 01:30:30.112
I got the ham on.

01:30:30.195 --> 01:30:34.616
- Ham'.7 No! We got to get out of here.
-Don't start that with me.

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.785
- Shut up!
-Bobby!

01:30:37.119 --> 01:30:38.704
You're hurting me.

01:30:56.013 --> 01:30:57.473
Gee whiz, Mom.

01:30:59.391 --> 01:31:01.602
I'm sorry. l...

01:31:01.894 --> 01:31:05.481
- I just wanted to show you something.
- Show me what?

01:31:05.606 --> 01:31:07.816
My car.

01:31:08.484 --> 01:31:13.447
- Yeah. Gosh, don't you remember the new car?
-The car? No.

01:31:13.697 --> 01:31:16.700
Let's go. Don't want to miss the big game.

01:31:16.825 --> 01:31:19.828
Dad's waiting downstairs. You know how he is.

01:31:19.912 --> 01:31:23.582
- Your father?
-Yeah. Good old Dad. What a guy.

01:31:23.749 --> 01:31:26.376
You're not Bobby. You're not Bobby!

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.046
- You're not him! Let me--
-Please!

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.134
God, lady. Don't wake up now.

01:31:34.218 --> 01:31:36.261
Open the door, you hear me?

01:31:36.345 --> 01:31:37.763
Open the door!

01:31:41.225 --> 01:31:44.269
Come on, lady. Open the door!

01:31:44.603 --> 01:31:46.271
Don't you hear me?

01:31:46.438 --> 01:31:50.692
You're going to get killed.
You're going to die. Come on.

01:32:40.075 --> 01:32:41.577
Frank!

01:32:52.296 --> 01:32:56.592
Don't you touch me. Don't you touch me.
Help! Frank!

01:33:04.933 --> 01:33:06.059
Mason?

01:33:11.398 --> 01:33:13.400
Move back. You heard the man.

01:33:46.391 --> 01:33:48.977
Get that strap on her.
Come on, let's go.

01:33:49.728 --> 01:33:51.438
Stay back, behind here.

01:33:54.942 --> 01:33:59.029
Mason, where is she? Where is she?

01:33:59.113 --> 01:34:00.406
I don't know.

01:34:00.489 --> 01:34:03.158
For the love of God. Faye!

01:34:08.664 --> 01:34:10.457
Faye, you all right?

01:34:10.916 --> 01:34:12.668
Is she all right?

01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:16.296
- Get back on the sidewalk.
- I'm going along. I'm her husband.

01:34:20.551 --> 01:34:21.552
Go!

01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:26.598
Hey! Carlos!

01:34:30.769 --> 01:34:32.187
No!

01:35:16.899 --> 01:35:19.109
What the hell are you stopping for?

01:35:19.401 --> 01:35:20.402
That.

01:35:21.737 --> 01:35:24.114
I don't see anything. It's justjunk.

01:35:24.198 --> 01:35:26.325
Come on, get moving. We haven't got all day.

01:35:26.408 --> 01:35:28.368
What's your hurry, Kovacs?

01:35:28.577 --> 01:35:30.746
The building's down. You won.

01:35:30.871 --> 01:35:32.247
Hip, hip, hooray!

01:35:32.372 --> 01:35:34.792
Leave the guy alone.
How long can he stay there?

01:35:34.875 --> 01:35:36.960
Look. I want him out of my way.

01:35:39.254 --> 01:35:41.381
When he moves, we move.

01:35:41.465 --> 01:35:42.883
Not 'till then.

01:37:24.818 --> 01:37:26.528
Now, here we are, dear.

01:37:26.904 --> 01:37:29.406
Just give me your arm and slip it through here.

01:37:30.491 --> 01:37:33.452
Be a good girl and put this on.

01:37:34.036 --> 01:37:35.829
Are we going home now?

01:37:36.288 --> 01:37:38.916
A different kind of home, but very nice.

01:37:38.999 --> 01:37:41.085
Across the river, in Jersey.

01:37:41.543 --> 01:37:45.172
You know who's there?
Muriel and Sid. Do you remember?

01:37:45.255 --> 01:37:46.924
I want to go home.

01:37:47.257 --> 01:37:50.219
We'll be together. That's all that counts.

01:37:50.928 --> 01:37:52.137
Excuse me.

01:37:52.763 --> 01:37:53.889
Mr. Riley?

01:37:56.225 --> 01:37:58.685
I brought these here for your wife.

01:38:00.104 --> 01:38:01.355
Some doughnuts.

01:38:08.404 --> 01:38:09.405
Faye.

01:38:10.489 --> 01:38:12.157
Look who's here.

01:38:15.202 --> 01:38:16.829
It's Bobby.

01:38:17.454 --> 01:38:18.914
He came back.

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:20.958
How about that?

01:38:58.912 --> 01:39:00.164
Mason Baylor?

01:39:00.664 --> 01:39:02.541
Marisa Esteval?

01:39:03.542 --> 01:39:05.586
Would you come with me, please?

01:39:06.628 --> 01:39:09.339
Mr. and Mrs. Riley?

01:39:30.152 --> 01:39:31.945
Fantastic! Unbelievable!

01:39:32.029 --> 01:39:35.324
I love the whole thing,
especially the sconces and corbelings...

01:39:35.407 --> 01:39:37.284
...the moldings, the relief!

01:39:37.367 --> 01:39:39.286
Oh, it's perfect.

01:39:43.707 --> 01:39:45.167
Hey, it's Harry.

01:39:50.339 --> 01:39:52.966
They're back, Faye. They're back.

01:39:56.303 --> 01:39:59.223
Good morning, chief. How do you like it?

01:40:12.945 --> 01:40:15.447
Mr. Lacey, this building burned last night.

01:40:15.531 --> 01:40:18.951
- Can you give us an explanation?
-Obviously, somebody made a mistake.

01:40:19.034 --> 01:40:21.995
What are your plans for this site,
in view of what's happened?

01:40:22.079 --> 01:40:24.415
My plans remain unchanged.

01:40:24.832 --> 01:40:29.044
I think it's a fake. It's prefab, fiberglass.
These people arejerking us around.

01:40:29.128 --> 01:40:30.671
Mr. Lacey, one more thing.

01:40:30.754 --> 01:40:34.091
If you want me to get rid of these reporters,
I will, no problem.

01:40:34.174 --> 01:40:35.384
You're fired, kid.

01:46:03.837 --> 01:46:05.923
