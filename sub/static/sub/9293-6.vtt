00:18.700 --> 00:20.900
MAN:
Going down! No!

00:22.334 --> 00:24.401
WAYNE:
 <i>How many people died in this?</i>

00:24.468 --> 00:26.267
No less than 12,000.

00:26.334 --> 00:27.733
Four more tactical nuclear

00:27.800 --> 00:29.934
weapons were stolen along
with the one that went off.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.067
 <i>CTU was trying to determine</i>

00:32.134 --> 00:33.134
where Fayed was

00:33.201 --> 00:35.167
at the time.
The worst case scenario

00:35.234 --> 00:36.633
is that he
is still alive

00:36.700 --> 00:39.267
and in possession of the
remaining nuclear weapons.

00:39.334 --> 00:40.501
My engineer died

00:40.568 --> 00:42.800
in the blast.
The device used

00:42.867 --> 00:44.434
to reprogram the trigger
was destroyed as well.

00:44.501 --> 00:46.633
 <i>I have four more bombs</i>
 <i>whose triggers need</i>

00:46.700 --> 00:48.034
to be made operational.

00:48.101 --> 00:50.468
We need someone who could
replicate what that device did,

00:50.534 --> 00:52.034
with modern equipment.

00:52.101 --> 00:53.700
McCarthy will find
someone for us.

00:53.767 --> 00:56.700
Tell the man these bombs
will go off today.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.800
Walid overheard
some conversations

00:58.867 --> 01:00.000
about the bombs.

01:00.067 --> 01:02.000
 <i>If there is an active</i>
 <i>shell inside</i>

01:02.067 --> 01:05.434
 <i>that detention facility,</i>
 <i>we need Walid to find out more.</i>

01:05.501 --> 01:08.101
He's wiring you.
It's a two-way radio.

01:08.167 --> 01:10.034
Now you're going
to tell me

01:10.101 --> 01:11.501
what we found in your
wallet, you understand me?

01:11.568 --> 01:12.267
(grunts)

01:12.334 --> 01:13.401
You're going to say

01:13.468 --> 01:15.034
that I asked about this man.

01:15.101 --> 01:16.800
Got to make them believe
you're working for them.

01:16.867 --> 01:18.867
What if they find out
he's wearing a wire?

01:18.934 --> 01:20.301
The guards inside know
what's going on.

01:20.367 --> 01:21.534
They'll keep an eye
on him.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.434
I sent Fayed to negotiate

01:23.501 --> 01:24.600
with an ex-Soviet general

01:24.667 --> 01:26.534
about the cache of tactical
nuclear weapons.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.700
What was the name
of the general?

01:27.767 --> 01:29.234
Dmitri Gredenko.

01:29.301 --> 01:30.334
Assad just gave us the name

01:30.401 --> 01:31.667
of a Russian general

01:31.733 --> 01:34.101
Fayed contacted a year ago
about the nukes.

01:34.167 --> 01:36.834
 <i>Gredenko did business</i>
 <i>with BXJ Technologies,</i>

01:36.900 --> 01:38.301
 <i>specifically with your father.</i>

01:38.367 --> 01:39.733
My father?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.633
I haven't spoken to him
for over nine years.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.501
Well, we'll send someone over
to talk to him.

01:43.568 --> 01:44.568
I should do this.

01:44.633 --> 01:46.234
He'll talk to me, if I go alone.

01:46.301 --> 01:48.367
You will never guess
who just called here.

01:48.434 --> 01:49.468
Who?

01:49.534 --> 01:50.667
Your brother Jack.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.000
 <i>What's he want?</i>

01:52.067 --> 01:53.468
He's looking for the old man.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.501
Damn it, we should have killed
Jack when we had the chance,

01:55.568 --> 01:57.067
instead of handing him over
to the Chinese.

01:57.134 --> 01:59.134
Look at the bright side:
you got out--

01:59.201 --> 02:00.934
you're here--
so just relax a little bit.

02:03.134 --> 02:05.401
Gray, people in
this country are dying.

02:05.468 --> 02:07.167
And I need some information.

02:07.234 --> 02:08.866
Are you going to
give it to me

02:08.934 --> 02:10.067
or do I have to start
hurting you?

02:10.133 --> 02:11.700
I told you I don't
know where Dad is.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.434
What do you want from me?
The truth!

02:13.501 --> 02:15.134
That is the truth.
I swear to you on
my family's life.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.800
Not good enough.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.468

WAYNE:
Although the crisis we face
today is a grave and dire one,

02:30.967 --> 02:32.301
we will rise above it.

02:32.367 --> 02:37.067
We have been challenged
as never before.

02:37.134 --> 02:39.900
This time, against this enemy,
armed with these weapons,

02:39.967 --> 02:42.733
we must rely
on the strength and faith

02:42.800 --> 02:44.468
of every single American.

02:44.534 --> 02:46.733
And that faith is unshakable.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.234
We must rise above our fears,
above our bigotries

02:51.301 --> 02:52.667
and stand our ground.

02:52.733 --> 02:56.234
Our goal is the defeat of
the enemy and the preservation

02:56.301 --> 02:57.767
of our values.

02:57.834 --> 03:00.800
We've achieved that goal
in the past.

03:00.867 --> 03:03.201
And so we shall again.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.201
Thank you.

03:06.267 --> 03:07.934
I wish he had not

03:08.000 --> 03:09.934
said that.
Sir?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.434
Made a promise
he can't keep.

03:13.501 --> 03:16.534
The American people have got
to get used to the fact

03:16.600 --> 03:19.234
these security measures
are a way of life,

03:19.301 --> 03:21.101
they're not some
temporary Band-Aid.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.667
Now you're making policy
unilaterally, Tom.

03:27.134 --> 03:28.434
The president was

03:28.501 --> 03:30.468
absolutely clear

03:30.534 --> 03:31.633
about your proposals.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.101
I'm sorry,
what is this about, Karen?

03:35.367 --> 03:37.767
"National Guard
supplanting police

03:37.834 --> 03:39.101
"in major cities,

03:39.167 --> 03:42.534
expanding detentions
based on soft intel."

03:42.600 --> 03:45.633
You authorized these
without presidential consent.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.534
Now how many times do you think

03:47.600 --> 03:49.167
we are going
to be going over this?

03:49.234 --> 03:51.600
I am taking preparatory steps

03:51.667 --> 03:54.334
to allow the president
to act swiftly,

03:54.401 --> 03:56.134
should he decide to act at all.

03:56.201 --> 03:58.767
Nobody is authorizing anything.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.733
That's what you said
about the detention facilities,

04:00.800 --> 04:03.134
and yet those
"preparatory measures"

04:03.201 --> 04:04.867
turned into an illegal
paramilitary operation.

04:04.934 --> 04:08.134
Well, however you may choose
to characterize it,

04:08.201 --> 04:10.167
The president agreed
to all of these actions...
That's because

04:10.234 --> 04:11.800
you've distorted the facts.
What is it, Tom?

04:11.867 --> 04:13.234
Is it that you think I'm some

04:13.301 --> 04:15.167
bleeding heart liberal

04:15.234 --> 04:16.534
preaching civil liberties--
is that it?

04:16.600 --> 04:18.567
I'll tell you what I think.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.966
The Constitution is
a wonderful thing, Karen,

04:22.034 --> 04:23.301
but back in the days

04:23.367 --> 04:25.468
of the Founding Fathers,
the weapon at hand was

04:25.534 --> 04:27.401
a single-shot musket.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.667
It took a half a minute
to load and fire.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.867
Fayed just killed 12,000 people

04:31.934 --> 04:34.934
in less time without
even taking aim.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I love the Constitution,

04:37.067 --> 04:39.667
but I won't be ducking behind it
when the next nuke goes off.

04:39.733 --> 04:42.700
I'm a realist, too, Tom, and
I am willing to do what it takes

04:42.767 --> 04:43.667
to protect this country...

04:43.733 --> 04:45.000
No, you are not!

04:45.067 --> 04:47.434
But I am looking a little
further down the road.

04:47.501 --> 04:49.000
These warrantless arrests and

04:49.067 --> 04:50.234
detention centers
will cause

04:50.301 --> 04:52.034
irreparable damage
to this country.

04:52.101 --> 04:54.301
Hey, you know something?
Why don't you just hop a shuttle

04:54.367 --> 04:55.534
over to Justice Department...

04:55.600 --> 04:58.000
You are using this crisis...
You don't belong

04:58.067 --> 04:59.067
in National Security.

04:59.134 --> 05:00.301
...to advance a very
dangerous agenda,

05:00.367 --> 05:02.101
Tom, and take advantage
of Presidential power.

05:02.167 --> 05:04.434
You know something?
I'm done in here.
And I will
not let you do it.

05:04.501 --> 05:05.800
And if you think
that you are going

05:05.867 --> 05:07.468
to wear me down, you are

05:07.534 --> 05:09.700
sadly mistaken.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.967
Actually,
you're wearing me down.

05:18.468 --> 05:19.934
No, that's right,
you won't make

05:20.000 --> 05:21.967
the same mistake again, because
you're going to give the file

05:22.034 --> 05:24.000
to Sharon, she's going
to handle it from there.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.034
No, get it done.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.234
I need Karen Hayes
to go away.

05:29.301 --> 05:30.434
I'm putting the last

05:30.501 --> 05:31.767
ties on that...
I need this now.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.367
I need the president to
sign off on my proposals.

05:34.434 --> 05:38.101
She has gone from being an
irritant to an obstacle.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.834
And she will be gone
soon, sir, I promise.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.034
I'm just waiting
to hear back

05:41.101 --> 05:42.900
from a few more people,
then you can approach her.

05:42.967 --> 05:47.034
This work you're doing for me,
it doesn't go unnoticed.

05:47.101 --> 05:49.967
Thank you, sir.

05:57.201 --> 05:58.867
Mr. Buchanan.
Yes.

05:58.934 --> 06:00.401
Are you aware
of the internal

06:00.468 --> 06:02.534
security mandate that's
just been issued?

06:02.600 --> 06:03.900
I haven't looked
at the hourlies yet.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.101
What's going on?
Anyone identified

06:05.167 --> 06:07.301
with a Middle Eastern
background is required

06:07.367 --> 06:10.067
to put a redundancy layer
on all their log-ins.

06:10.134 --> 06:11.667
I see.

06:11.733 --> 06:14.000
Look, normally, I'm not
sensitive to this kind of thing,

06:14.067 --> 06:16.468
you know that,
but this is not the time to be

06:16.534 --> 06:19.267
racially profiling people
who have grade-four
security clearance.

06:19.334 --> 06:20.633
I agree, I'm not going
to argue with you.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.034
Good-- so you give
me an exemption?

06:22.101 --> 06:24.568
I'll take this issue
to the attorney general,

06:24.633 --> 06:26.267
but it's not going
to happen right away.

06:26.334 --> 06:27.700
Well, how am I supposed to work

06:27.767 --> 06:28.900
with one hand tied
behind my back?

06:28.967 --> 06:30.034
Listen, you
and I both

06:30.101 --> 06:31.334
knew when I hired you that

06:31.401 --> 06:32.767
a Muslim working counter-terror
in the United States

06:32.834 --> 06:35.000
was going to have to
put up with some unfair

06:35.067 --> 06:36.334
measures-- this is
one of them.

06:36.401 --> 06:38.000
I know.
But today, of all days...

06:38.067 --> 06:39.733
Especially today.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.667
I need you to stay focused
on the big picture.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.700
When this is behind us,
I will take this issue

06:45.767 --> 06:47.733
to the attorney general,
I promise you.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.367
Have we heard from Jack yet?

06:51.434 --> 06:53.101
Not since he went
to go see his brother.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.334
Want me to try and reach him?

06:54.401 --> 06:56.234
No. He'll call us
when he has something.

06:58.301 --> 07:01.501
(muffled grunt,
rapid gasping)

07:01.568 --> 07:03.367
(explosive cough,
wheezing)

07:03.434 --> 07:04.934
You lie to me again,
the bag goes back on.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.967
Do you understand me?

07:06.034 --> 07:08.134
(raspy coughing)

07:08.201 --> 07:10.501
Start talking, Gray!

07:10.568 --> 07:11.834
(gasping):
Dad...

07:11.900 --> 07:14.201
Dad didn't want anyone to know
where he went.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.900
He didn't even leave a number,
in case of an emergency?

07:15.967 --> 07:18.167
No, you can't reach him, Jack.

07:18.234 --> 07:20.201
(catching breath):
After the bomb was...

07:20.267 --> 07:22.334
detonated,
he told me he was

07:22.401 --> 07:23.867
cutting himself off.

07:23.934 --> 07:26.468
(crying quietly)

07:26.534 --> 07:28.434
I don't believe you.

07:28.501 --> 07:29.468
(sobs loudly)

07:29.534 --> 07:31.468
I think he told you
where he was going.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.568
No, no! It's the truth!

07:32.633 --> 07:33.934
Fine...

07:34.000 --> 07:36.234
No, no!
I don't know! I don't know!

07:36.301 --> 07:37.733
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

07:37.800 --> 07:42.000
(growling gasps)

07:42.067 --> 07:45.534
He went to see a...
a guy who works for us.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.167
His name's
Darren McCarthy.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.633
Why?

07:48.700 --> 07:52.367
It was my fault.

07:52.434 --> 07:54.600
I made a mess.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.633
Dad's trying
to clean it up.
What do you mean?

07:56.700 --> 07:59.301
You were right.
It's about the nukes.

07:59.367 --> 08:01.367
(sighs, gasps)

08:01.434 --> 08:02.967
The connection you
found between Dad

08:03.034 --> 08:05.401
and Gredenko had to do
with a... a contract

08:05.468 --> 08:06.733
that was awarded to us.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.900
Through the company?

08:07.967 --> 08:09.301
Yeah, it all went
through BXJ.

08:09.367 --> 08:11.301
What did an ex-Russian general
have to do

08:11.367 --> 08:12.434
with the contract?

08:12.501 --> 08:14.301
It was his job... to release

08:14.367 --> 08:17.201
the old nukes into the U.S.
for decommissioning.

08:17.267 --> 08:21.267
BXJ was hired to dismantle
some of the smaller bombs

08:21.334 --> 08:24.267
and to recycle their cores

08:24.334 --> 08:26.800
into energy production--
we do it all the time.

08:26.867 --> 08:27.934
What happened?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.733
(heavy sigh)

08:29.800 --> 08:31.733
I hired McCarthy to
oversee the job,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.467
but I didn't check him
out carefully enough.

08:33.534 --> 08:35.333
So, basically, he came in
with the lowest bid

08:35.400 --> 08:36.700
and you just hired him!

08:36.767 --> 08:39.600
I-I... M-My head was into
other things at the time.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.067
I-I-I... H-He came in
with good references.

08:42.134 --> 08:43.366
I saw no reason to get
all anal about it.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.767
So the nukes that these
terrorists are in possession of,

08:45.834 --> 08:48.234
including the one that was just
detonated in Valencia,

08:48.301 --> 08:49.733
were supplied by McCarthy

08:49.800 --> 08:50.934
and stolen from you.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Yes, in a nutshell,
that's it.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.167
Sam told me Dad left
yesterday...

08:55.234 --> 08:57.101
which means that you and he
knew about this

08:57.167 --> 08:58.301
before today,
and you didn't report it.

08:58.367 --> 08:59.834
We didn't report it
because we thought

08:59.900 --> 09:01.334
we could take care of it
more efficiently.

09:01.401 --> 09:02.700
Damn it, Gray!

09:02.767 --> 09:03.967
Do you know how many people
have died

09:04.034 --> 09:05.134
because you're trying
to cover your ass?!

09:05.201 --> 09:07.167
We had no idea that this
was going to happen.

09:07.234 --> 09:09.000
And besides,
what Dad and I are doing

09:09.067 --> 09:10.301
to stop this is
more effective

09:10.367 --> 09:12.167
than what you and your
people are gonna do.

09:12.234 --> 09:13.600
What, exactly,

09:13.667 --> 09:16.867
are you doing?

09:16.934 --> 09:18.800
Dad put together a security team

09:18.867 --> 09:21.800
and he went out
to look for McCarthy.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.167
Where?

09:23.234 --> 09:25.834
He was staking out
McCarthy's office.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.733
He checked in about an hour ago.

09:30.568 --> 09:33.800
Where is this office?

09:33.867 --> 09:35.434
He's in Simi.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.301
We're going.

09:41.367 --> 09:43.201
I'm not leaving
my family, Jack.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.800
Not today.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.034
Oh, yes, you are.

09:54.501 --> 09:55.501
Get up!

10:12.267 --> 10:13.733
Graem, where are
you going?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.534
Jack and I have to go
find Dad.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.101
What do you mean,
find him?

10:17.167 --> 10:19.000
He's not reachable right
now; we have to go out

10:19.067 --> 10:21.334
 and pick him up-- I want you
to stay here, all right?

10:21.401 --> 10:23.501
You stay with Josh,
don't either of you
go outside the house.

10:23.568 --> 10:25.000
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.633
What's the address?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.234
McCarthy's office
is off the 23.

10:38.301 --> 10:40.101
5137 Olson Avenue.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.367
Who are you calling?

10:41.434 --> 10:42.367
(phone ringing)

10:42.434 --> 10:43.834
CTU. O'Brian.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.501
Chloe, it's Jack.
Let me speak to Bill.

10:45.568 --> 10:46.600
He's being briefed
on Fayed.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.334
Have you picked up
any threads?
Not yet.

10:48.401 --> 10:50.800
I've got one-- I want you
to send two field units

10:50.867 --> 10:52.501
to 5137 Olson Avenue,
in Simi Valley.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.733
It should be off
the 23.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.367
I want them to wait
for me there.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.867
Get Bill to call me back
as soon as he's out of
the briefing.

10:57.934 --> 10:59.167
Okay, I will.

10:59.234 --> 11:00.733
So that's it, Jack, huh?
You're just gonna

11:00.800 --> 11:02.367
sell out Dad and me.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.264
--We've been monitoring
ground movement

11:18.331 --> 11:19.931
ever since
the bomb went off.

11:19.497 --> 11:21.097
We locked down streets,
we're doing vehicle

11:21.164 --> 11:22.464
searches--
so far, nothing.

11:22.531 --> 11:24.364
No sign of Fayed.
MORRIS:
Which means he could still

11:24.431 --> 11:26.197
hunkered down within
the perimeter-- what are
we doing about that?

11:26.264 --> 11:27.597
We've got NEST teams
in the area now.

11:27.664 --> 11:28.864
They're going
street by street.

11:28.930 --> 11:30.697
That'll take hours.
Yeah, Morris,

11:30.764 --> 11:32.764
it's all going to take time.
If we could do it quicker,

11:32.831 --> 11:35.364
we would.
We can use the direction
of the fallout to our advantage.

11:35.431 --> 11:37.297
If Fayed is still
in the perimeter,

11:37.364 --> 11:38.631
he'll be moving
in the opposite direction.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.831
And he'll have to be
monitoring the fallout.

11:40.898 --> 11:43.664
Which means he's got technology
in the "on" position.

11:43.731 --> 11:44.798
Let's use radio
frequency satellite,

11:44.864 --> 11:46.330
see what we can come up with.
Good.

11:46.397 --> 11:48.464
Get on it.
Mr. Buchanan,
Jack just called in.

11:48.531 --> 11:50.564
He's following some kind
of lead in Simi Valley.

11:50.631 --> 11:52.631
He wants you to call
him right away.
Anything else?

11:52.697 --> 11:53.963
Nothing.
He asked me to send

11:54.030 --> 11:55.798
two teams to meet him.
Any leads on finding

11:55.864 --> 11:57.330
Gredenko?
Not yet.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.697
CIA is trying
to track him

11:58.764 --> 12:00.464
down in Moscow.
Okay, thank you.

12:07.798 --> 12:10.063
If you give CTU McCarthy's name,

12:10.130 --> 12:11.497
they will eventually
come after the family.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.264
That is not
necessarily true.

12:13.330 --> 12:15.864
CTU is interested in
finding these bombs,
not networking

12:15.930 --> 12:17.764
a series of indictments.
Oh, will you not be

12:17.831 --> 12:19.130
so simple-minded for once

12:19.197 --> 12:20.697
in your life!
CTU,

12:20.764 --> 12:22.930
like every other federal
organization, is made up

12:22.997 --> 12:24.564
of human beings
with ambition.

12:24.631 --> 12:26.297
When the dust settles,
they will start

12:26.364 --> 12:27.564
digging deeper,
you can count on it.

12:27.631 --> 12:29.063
Well, unfortunately for you,
Gray, right now

12:29.130 --> 12:30.798
you're going
to have to trust me.

12:30.864 --> 12:33.297
Trust you? After what you
did to me at the house,

12:33.364 --> 12:35.230
all I trust in is your
sadistic tendencies.
(cell phone ringing)

12:35.297 --> 12:37.697
This is Bauer.
What'd you find out?

12:37.764 --> 12:40.097
Bill, I want you
to run a locater check
on a Darren McCarthy.

12:40.164 --> 12:42.898
Who is he?
He was an independent
munitions contractor.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.197
He worked for
BXJ Technologies.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.464
How does McCarthy
figure into all this?

12:47.531 --> 12:49.063
My father's company
hired him

12:49.130 --> 12:51.364
to decommission
the nukes.

12:51.431 --> 12:52.963
I believe he brokered
them to Fayed.

12:53.030 --> 12:54.731
So except for McCarthy,
your father's company

12:54.798 --> 12:56.731
had nothing to
do with Fayed?

12:56.798 --> 12:58.464
I don't know BXJ's
involvement yet.

12:58.531 --> 12:59.831
All right, we're on it.
Where are you?

12:59.898 --> 13:01.997
I'm heading to McCarthy's
office in Simi Valley.

13:02.063 --> 13:04.831
I don't think he's there,
but I might be able to get
something off his computer.

13:04.898 --> 13:06.297
We have teams standing by.
Let me know.

13:06.364 --> 13:08.963
Copy that.
(phone snaps shut)

13:09.030 --> 13:11.431
You know, if you're doing
this to come after me,

13:11.497 --> 13:14.097
eventually Dad will
get caught in the middle.

13:15.364 --> 13:16.597
Or maybe you want that,
maybe you want

13:16.664 --> 13:18.930
Dad to go to prison, too.

13:20.997 --> 13:23.097
Boy, Jack...

13:23.164 --> 13:25.564
it's good to see your loyalty's
still with your family.

13:27.631 --> 13:30.364
If I were you,
I wouldn't talk about loyalty.

13:33.164 --> 13:35.330
McCARTHY:
I know it's not easy, that's why
they're willing to pay

13:35.397 --> 13:37.330
$7 million cash.

13:37.397 --> 13:39.130
What about Taylor Paskal,
why can't he do it?

13:39.197 --> 13:40.798
MAN (on phone):
He's a theoretical physicist.

13:40.864 --> 13:42.130
He doesn't have enough
practical background

13:42.197 --> 13:44.930
to reprogram a nuclear trigger.
Who does?

13:44.997 --> 13:46.330
I'm still looking.
Fayed needs

13:46.397 --> 13:48.664
someone now;
get me a name, damn it!

13:48.731 --> 13:51.130
(slams phone down)

13:51.197 --> 13:52.297
Where are we going now?

13:52.364 --> 13:53.963
What do you care
where we're going?

13:54.030 --> 13:56.264
Darren, I don't feel
safe in this city.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.497
I was here when you
mentioned that earlier.

13:58.564 --> 14:02.097
Okay... It seems to me

14:02.164 --> 14:03.631
like whatever this is
you're trying to do

14:03.697 --> 14:04.831
is a long shot.

14:04.898 --> 14:06.397
You're just going
to waste all this time

14:06.464 --> 14:08.497
and it's going to be
harder to get away.

14:08.564 --> 14:11.030
(tires screeching)

14:12.397 --> 14:14.464
Get out.
What?!

14:14.531 --> 14:15.930
Your negativity is not
what I need right now.

14:15.997 --> 14:18.464
I need less stress, not more.

14:18.531 --> 14:20.497
(gasping)

14:22.531 --> 14:24.497
(wry laugh)

14:29.397 --> 14:32.264
How sure a thing...

14:32.330 --> 14:34.297
is this $7 million?

14:35.997 --> 14:37.464
Now that's the
type of question

14:37.531 --> 14:39.464
that I love
hearing from you.

14:39.531 --> 14:41.531
(cell phone ringing)

14:43.697 --> 14:45.230
Yeah.

14:45.297 --> 14:47.431
Have you found an engineer?

14:47.497 --> 14:48.764
Not yet.

14:48.831 --> 14:50.798
Why not?

14:50.864 --> 14:52.364
(sighs):
Give me a break, Fayed.

14:52.431 --> 14:54.564
This is not some easy
one-stop shopping.

14:54.631 --> 14:55.997
You said within
the hour.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.164
I know what I said.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.831
It's just taking longer.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.063
I told you I'd find someone

15:01.130 --> 15:03.097
and I will.
(closes phone)

15:09.431 --> 15:11.597
SAMUELS:
That's the last of the group.

15:13.464 --> 15:14.431
So what do you do with them now?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.097
Patch the images over to CTU.

15:16.164 --> 15:18.864
They can cross them
with international watch lists.

15:18.930 --> 15:20.464
Didn't you already
vet these people?

15:20.531 --> 15:21.864
CTU has more resources.

15:21.930 --> 15:24.631
They can go deeper,
find the connection to Fayed.

15:33.664 --> 15:36.097
Samuels just sent us
images of the men

15:36.164 --> 15:37.731
Walid is undercover with.
MORRIS:
Excellent.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.030
Send them to my system,
when Nadia

15:39.097 --> 15:40.531
gets me the manifest;
I'll cross them against

15:40.597 --> 15:41.898
all of our watch lists.

15:41.963 --> 15:43.798
Wait... Nadia didn't get you
the manifests yet?

15:43.864 --> 15:45.030
No.
Why not?

15:45.097 --> 15:46.297
I haven't a clue, mate.

15:50.197 --> 15:52.364
Hey, you were supposed
to send the manifest

15:52.431 --> 15:53.697
from the detention
facility over to comm.

15:53.764 --> 15:55.297
Why don't we have it yet?
I'm backed up.

15:55.364 --> 15:56.697
Well, why are you backed up?

15:56.764 --> 15:58.030
Milo, I'm doing
the best that I can here.

15:58.097 --> 15:59.230
You got a problem with it,

15:59.297 --> 16:00.397
take it somewhere else.

16:00.464 --> 16:02.230
Hey...

16:02.297 --> 16:03.697
I'm just trying
to understand what

16:03.764 --> 16:05.898
the problem is.
The detention facility's

16:05.963 --> 16:07.364
one of the only
live leads we have.

16:07.431 --> 16:09.230
Go ask Buchanan.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.097
Okay.

16:21.497 --> 16:23.297
We've got a support team
in place, if Jack needs

16:23.364 --> 16:24.330
more backup,
he'll let you know.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.798
Yeah.
What is it, Milo?

16:30.831 --> 16:32.063
Nadia.

16:32.130 --> 16:34.164
She's falling
behind on her tasks.

16:34.230 --> 16:35.664
What's going
on with her?
Nothing.

16:35.731 --> 16:37.731
Petition her workload

16:37.798 --> 16:39.664
and hand some of it off
to another analyst.

16:39.731 --> 16:41.264
I've only got her
working on one process.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.464
She's doing some things
for me directly, Milo.

16:42.531 --> 16:44.963
Just do it, please.
Mr. Buchanan,

16:45.030 --> 16:46.230
with all due respect,

16:46.297 --> 16:47.431
is there something
going on here you don't

16:47.497 --> 16:49.230
want me to know about?
Yes, there is, Milo.

16:49.297 --> 16:51.564
Either give Nadia enough
time to finish the work,

16:51.631 --> 16:52.864
or give the work
to somebody else.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.164
Sir, I'm the technical leader
on the floor.

16:55.230 --> 16:56.664
If you want me to do my job

16:56.731 --> 16:58.264
effectively, I need to
know what's happening.

17:04.864 --> 17:06.297
Because Nadia's of
Middle Eastern descent,

17:06.364 --> 17:07.464
she's been flagged

17:07.531 --> 17:08.897
by Homeland Security.

17:08.963 --> 17:10.897
That's ridiculous.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.564
She's... lived in this country

17:13.631 --> 17:14.864
since she was two years old.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.763
She's... a registered

17:16.830 --> 17:18.097
Republican, for crying out loud.
You're wasting your

17:18.164 --> 17:19.464
breath, Milo--
there's nothing I can do

17:19.531 --> 17:21.564
about this right now.
Let it go, will you please?

17:21.631 --> 17:23.664
No, sir, I don't see how
we can just "let it go."

17:23.731 --> 17:25.130
Aren't we trying
to find four

17:25.196 --> 17:27.263
suitcase nukes that might
still be in this city?
Milo...

17:27.329 --> 17:29.264
I need everyone on the floor
working at full speed.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.464
I understand that, Milo.

17:30.531 --> 17:31.664
Now get back to work.

17:36.497 --> 17:38.130
Yes, sir.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.597
(phone ringing)

17:48.664 --> 17:49.864
Yeah, hi.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.531
Have you heard
about this latest mandate

17:51.597 --> 17:52.831
from Homeland Security?

17:52.898 --> 17:54.063
No, why. What is it?

17:54.130 --> 17:56.063
They're racially
profiling our own agents.

17:56.130 --> 17:57.397
What?!

17:57.464 --> 17:58.731
It just came down
from the White House.

17:58.798 --> 18:01.664
The problem is one of my best
people is hamstrung.

18:01.731 --> 18:04.197
She has to work twice
as hard to get through these

18:04.264 --> 18:06.731
security measures.
They're not security
measures, Bill.

18:06.798 --> 18:08.597
They're the paranoid delusions

18:08.664 --> 18:10.898
of Tom Lennox.

18:10.963 --> 18:12.230
Is there anything you can do?

18:12.297 --> 18:15.230
I can talk to the president.

18:15.297 --> 18:18.063
Thank you.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.030
You're welcome.

18:20.097 --> 18:22.063
(hangs up phone)

18:24.130 --> 18:26.264
He went off to Valencia

18:26.330 --> 18:27.798
over an hour ago.

18:29.330 --> 18:30.764
How many were killed?

18:30.831 --> 18:33.397
We don't know yet.

18:33.464 --> 18:35.898
(over speaker): They say
there are four more visitors.

18:35.963 --> 18:37.564
WALID:
Four more visitors.
What does that mean?

18:37.631 --> 18:38.764
I'm not sure.

18:38.831 --> 18:40.364
But you think it
may have something

18:40.431 --> 18:42.497
to do with what happened
in Valencia?

18:42.564 --> 18:43.864
How did you get the information?

18:43.930 --> 18:47.097
Why are you asking
so many questions?

18:47.164 --> 18:49.431
Whatever happens
out there

18:49.497 --> 18:51.030
affects us in here.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.531
We need to share 
everything we know.

19:00.831 --> 19:02.564
Heydar has been in contact.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.264
How?

19:04.330 --> 19:07.197
He smuggled in a cell phone.

19:09.464 --> 19:10.898
How did you do that?

19:10.963 --> 19:14.063
Cell phone? How did he get
a cell phone in there?

19:14.130 --> 19:15.731
These facilities
were put up quickly.

19:15.798 --> 19:17.764
The security's
still pretty porous.

19:17.831 --> 19:19.397
Then we need
to get this man's phone

19:19.464 --> 19:20.764
and find out
who he's talking to.

19:20.831 --> 19:23.264
If Walid can get the phone,
I can trace any call

19:23.330 --> 19:24.731
that's been 
made from it.

19:24.798 --> 19:26.264
If I can get a live
conversation, that's worth

19:26.330 --> 19:28.297
more than a list 
of phone numbers.

19:28.364 --> 19:30.063
Fine. Then, after that,
get Walid out of there.

19:30.130 --> 19:32.930
No. They're talking to him now.
That's a big get.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.731
We have to keep
listening in

19:34.798 --> 19:36.664
on whatever they say.

19:36.731 --> 19:38.297
This is Agent Samuels.

19:38.364 --> 19:40.431
I'm going to need
to get into a cell tower--

19:40.497 --> 19:42.930
grid location:
15 comma

19:42.997 --> 19:44.464
twenty-seven.

19:54.997 --> 19:56.464
It's done.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.764
All these people
will come forward

20:00.831 --> 20:02.364
if we need
them to testify?

20:02.431 --> 20:04.164
Yes. I put the screws
to every one of them myself.

20:04.230 --> 20:05.431
They're all yours.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.464
Good.

20:08.798 --> 20:11.631
Oh, Karen...
I need to talk to you.

20:11.697 --> 20:12.631
Just a minute.

20:12.697 --> 20:14.464
 <i>Now</i> would be better.

20:14.531 --> 20:18.531
Have this signed,
and then send it out.

20:18.597 --> 20:20.997
This, uh, this just simply
isn't working for me.

20:21.063 --> 20:22.631
I can't have you
stand in my way

20:22.697 --> 20:24.963
anymore.
What?

20:25.030 --> 20:26.898
I need the president's
undivided attention,

20:26.963 --> 20:28.631
and you, frankly,
are dividing it.

20:28.697 --> 20:31.531
Well, I'm not going
to stop doing my job, Tom,

20:31.597 --> 20:33.564
just because it irritates you.
I thought

20:33.631 --> 20:34.997
I made that 
perfectly clear.

20:35.063 --> 20:36.564
Yeah. I'd like you to tend
your resignation, Karen.

20:36.631 --> 20:37.930
(scoffs)

20:37.997 --> 20:39.030
My resignation?

20:39.097 --> 20:41.831
What are you smoking?

20:41.898 --> 20:44.697
No, no, no. I'm here

20:44.764 --> 20:46.130
to blow away all of the smoke.

20:46.197 --> 20:47.330
I want to talk about your

20:47.397 --> 20:49.030
husband's
incompetence,

20:49.097 --> 20:50.864
and your covering it up.
I don't like this

20:50.930 --> 20:51.997
conversation.

20:52.063 --> 20:53.364
What are you talking about?

20:53.431 --> 20:54.531
14 months ago,

20:54.597 --> 20:58.764
we had Abu Fayed in CTU custody
in Seattle,

20:58.831 --> 21:01.297
and Bill Buchanan
signed off on
his release.

21:01.364 --> 21:02.431
I don't believe this.

21:02.497 --> 21:03.664
The case that
you're referring to,

21:03.731 --> 21:06.531
if I remember correctly,
involved over 20 detainees.

21:06.597 --> 21:10.164
Not prisoners, Tom.
Detainees.

21:10.230 --> 21:12.230
And, at the time,
there was not enough evidence

21:12.297 --> 21:13.731
to hold them.

21:13.798 --> 21:15.930
It's just a little grayer
than that, now, isn't it?

21:15.997 --> 21:17.230
If what you're saying
is true, how come

21:17.297 --> 21:19.898
that incident wound up
blue-coded at Homeland

21:19.963 --> 21:22.597
in a dead-end file?

21:22.664 --> 21:25.197
I got Peter Iannone here,
Kurt Hueig, Myra Mawk...

21:25.264 --> 21:28.197
They were all
in the pipeline--
all ready to testify

21:28.264 --> 21:30.697
that you sequestered that file
to protect your husband. 

21:30.764 --> 21:33.030
I did nothing illegal
or incorrect!

21:33.097 --> 21:34.631
Every single one

21:34.697 --> 21:37.464
of those detainees
were cleared of any
conspiracy charges.

21:37.531 --> 21:39.798
Nevertheless,
one of these detainees

21:39.864 --> 21:41.631
detonated a nuclear bomb
in Los Angeles.

21:41.697 --> 21:44.330
You think your husband
could survive that story?

21:44.397 --> 21:45.564
Or you, for that matter?

21:45.631 --> 21:47.864
Do you want to get in the ring
with me, Tom?

21:47.930 --> 21:48.864
You've got skeletons

21:48.930 --> 21:51.030
in your closet,
and I will not

21:51.097 --> 21:53.030
hesitate to pull them out.

21:53.097 --> 21:55.297
We've all got
our skeletons, Karen.

21:55.364 --> 21:57.664
It's proof
we don't all have.

21:57.731 --> 21:59.130
I've got mine.

21:59.197 --> 22:01.963
How long before
you get yours?

22:02.030 --> 22:03.898
You're a son of a bitch.

22:03.963 --> 22:06.063
I never claimed otherwise.

22:06.130 --> 22:10.230
But I am not out to hurt
you or your husband

22:10.297 --> 22:11.997
personally.

22:12.063 --> 22:14.764
I just need room to work.

22:14.831 --> 22:16.397
Your resignation

22:16.464 --> 22:18.197
within the hour.

22:39.997 --> 22:42.197
--Can we go a little slower?
There's no rush.

22:42.264 --> 22:43.830
Morris, I'm going
as fast as I can.

22:43.897 --> 22:45.497
Why don't you just go back
to your station?

22:45.563 --> 22:47.131
I'll send it over as soon
as I'm ready.

22:47.197 --> 22:48.463
No, I'm curious as to why

22:48.530 --> 22:50.097
it's taking you five minutes
to do something

22:50.164 --> 22:51.430
that should take
ten seconds.

22:51.497 --> 22:55.097
Because I borrowed
two of her processors

22:55.164 --> 22:56.064
to run a batch job.

22:56.131 --> 22:57.764
She's running on 20%.

22:57.830 --> 23:00.364
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't
somebody tell me this?

23:00.430 --> 23:02.664
I just did.

23:02.730 --> 23:04.164
Fine. But don't

23:04.231 --> 23:05.231
keep any secrets
from me, darling.

23:05.298 --> 23:06.997
We're on the same side.

23:11.730 --> 23:12.730
Why'd you lie for me?

23:12.797 --> 23:14.830
I talked to Buchanan.

23:14.897 --> 23:17.764
Yeah, it's pretty frustrating.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.463
I'm sure.

23:29.398 --> 23:30.364
What are you doing?

23:30.430 --> 23:33.897
I'm logging you in
under my user I.D.

23:33.964 --> 23:34.997
That's illegal.

23:35.064 --> 23:38.331
And you didn't do it, I did.

23:42.164 --> 23:43.897
Thank you.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.931
Yeah, you should...
be fine.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.931
(quiet conversation)

24:15.964 --> 24:17.964
Excuse me, Mr. President,
I need to speak with you.

24:18.031 --> 24:20.563
Karen, I'm a little
squeezed for time right now.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.630
Can we talk later?
No, sir, we can't.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.864
Okay.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.364
Thank you.

24:34.864 --> 24:39.298
Mr. President, I am tendering
my resignation,

24:39.364 --> 24:41.197
effective immediately.

24:42.664 --> 24:44.764
What's going on, Karen?

24:44.830 --> 24:46.031
It's a personal
matter, sir.

24:46.097 --> 24:48.164
Is there something wrong
with you or Bill?

24:48.231 --> 24:49.597
No, we're fine.

24:49.664 --> 24:52.497
It's... I cannot elaborate.

24:53.697 --> 24:55.897
I've noticed that you and Tom

24:55.964 --> 24:57.264
have been locking horns

24:57.331 --> 24:58.664
these past few weeks.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.398
Is that what
this is about?
Sir, I would rather not say.

25:00.463 --> 25:02.231
Damn it, Karen,
that is unacceptable.

25:02.298 --> 25:04.064
Mr. President...
I need you!

25:04.131 --> 25:06.064
I need different
points of view.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.697
Now I understand it's difficult
to sit in a room with someone

25:08.764 --> 25:10.031
who opposes you
constantly,

25:10.097 --> 25:11.597
but that is part
of your job.

25:11.664 --> 25:14.997
And I have never seen
anyone handle it
better than you.

25:15.064 --> 25:18.830
Now I am sorry, Karen, but I
cannot accept your resignation.

25:18.897 --> 25:21.097
Not now, not today.

25:21.164 --> 25:23.797
No disrespect, sir,
but you're going to have to.

25:25.364 --> 25:27.997
Mr. President,
I'm here to tell you

25:28.064 --> 25:29.463
that the past few weeks
have been

25:29.530 --> 25:31.131
some of the must difficult weeks

25:31.197 --> 25:32.997
that I have ever seen
a president face.

25:33.064 --> 25:37.697
And I am truly honored
to serve under you
here in Washington.

25:37.764 --> 25:40.031
And I appreciate that you value
my advice,

25:40.097 --> 25:43.398
but, sir, the truth is, you have
been your own best counselor.

25:43.463 --> 25:50.097
You know what
to do, sir.

25:50.164 --> 25:53.964
And I have no doubt,
absolutely no doubt...

25:54.031 --> 25:58.064
that you will continue
to rise to this challenge.

26:08.463 --> 26:11.064
Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

26:11.131 --> 26:14.830
No, sir, there is not.

26:14.897 --> 26:17.264
I would appreciate it,

26:17.331 --> 26:21.331
however, if you would reassign
me to L.A. CTU.

26:21.398 --> 26:23.197
I feel I will serve best there.

26:23.264 --> 26:27.964
I'll approve you for
military transport west.

26:28.031 --> 26:29.830
Thank you, sir.

26:34.864 --> 26:36.331
Mr. President.

26:36.398 --> 26:39.430
I'm sorry.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.264
So am I.

26:57.697 --> 26:59.164
Oh.
Oh.

26:59.231 --> 27:01.298
Excuse me, Karen,
I'm so sorry.

27:01.364 --> 27:03.131
Oh, actually, Karen,
I'm glad I caught you.

27:03.197 --> 27:05.797
I've got a State Department
white paper

27:05.864 --> 27:06.964
I was hoping you
could look over

27:07.031 --> 27:08.031
and then take
to the president.

27:08.097 --> 27:09.664
No, you'll have
to give it to Tom.

27:09.730 --> 27:11.730
Well, I thought
you handled that.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.364
Give it to Tom.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.064
Excuse me.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.364
(phone ringing)

27:30.430 --> 27:32.164
Yes.

27:32.231 --> 27:34.131
Karen Hayes is out.

27:55.164 --> 27:57.663
--The last one is a black Kia,
California license plate

27:57.730 --> 28:00.763
Niner, Yankee, Sierra,

28:00.830 --> 28:02.097
Uniform, 1-0-8.

28:02.164 --> 28:05.431
That one's not registered
to McCarthy either.

28:05.498 --> 28:07.231
Okay, I want you
to cross-reference the names

28:07.297 --> 28:09.197
with registered owners,
see if any of them correlate.

28:09.264 --> 28:11.663
What do you want
me to do with the
backup teams?

28:11.730 --> 28:12.830
Where are they?

28:12.897 --> 28:14.531
They're holding
a two-block radius.

28:14.598 --> 28:16.231
Send one of them over
to the parking lot here,

28:16.297 --> 28:17.564
tell the other
to stand by.

28:17.630 --> 28:19.364
I'll get back to you.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.598
Where's McCarthy's office?
What floor?

28:21.663 --> 28:23.131
Second floor.
Let's go.

29:10.764 --> 29:12.264
--You all right?

29:12.330 --> 29:15.430
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

29:19.464 --> 29:20.597
--All right, I've got the phone.

29:20.664 --> 29:22.697
Good. I'm going to give you
a number to dial

29:22.764 --> 29:24.998
then CTU will be able
to access the phone's records.

29:25.063 --> 29:28.364
After dialing the number,
hit the star button twice.

29:28.430 --> 29:33.230
The number is 310-597-3781.

29:33.297 --> 29:38.397
Again, the number:
310-597-3781.

29:38.464 --> 29:39.998
Once we get everything
off the SIM,

29:40.063 --> 29:42.130
I'll let you know,
you can put the phone back.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.230
All right, but hurry.
It won't be long before

29:44.297 --> 29:45.230
he discovers it's missing.

29:45.297 --> 29:46.230
He got the phone.

29:46.297 --> 29:47.430
There's nothing else he can do.

29:47.497 --> 29:50.597
Well, let's just
see what we get.

29:50.664 --> 29:51.697
CTU. O'Brian.

29:51.764 --> 29:52.631
Chloe, it's Agent Samuels.

29:52.697 --> 29:53.731
We've got the phone.

29:53.797 --> 29:55.030
I'm piping a byte stream
to you now.

29:55.097 --> 29:59.898
Work up every number you get.

29:59.964 --> 30:00.864
All right, it's coming through.

30:00.931 --> 30:01.931
What's it look like?

30:01.998 --> 30:03.097
This data's encoded.

30:03.163 --> 30:05.464
It looks like there's over
120 numbers or so.

30:05.531 --> 30:07.464
I can't tell if they're
recently dialed or stored.

30:07.531 --> 30:09.797
I'll untangle it
and get back to you
in a few minutes.

30:09.864 --> 30:10.831
But you got
everything, right?

30:10.898 --> 30:11.864
Yeah.

30:14.364 --> 30:16.864
Walid did a great job
of getting that phone.

30:16.931 --> 30:18.631
Then please let him go

30:18.697 --> 30:20.264
before he gets hurt.

30:20.330 --> 30:23.030
I'm going to tell you
one last time, Ms. Palmer--

30:23.097 --> 30:24.597
these men know something
about the bombs

30:24.664 --> 30:26.130
that we don't.

30:26.197 --> 30:29.163
Walid has earned
their trust.

30:29.230 --> 30:31.097
That's a situation
that we've lucked into.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.831
And we will
not terminate it

30:32.898 --> 30:35.564
as long as he can continue
to harvest information.

30:37.697 --> 30:38.964
All right, Walid,

30:39.030 --> 30:41.230
you can put the phone back.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.497
Okay.

31:34.097 --> 31:35.831
(phone rings)

31:35.898 --> 31:38.430
Yeah, Chloe.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.664
I don't think these guys

31:39.731 --> 31:40.964
you're tracking are connected
to anyone.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.230
What are you talking about?

31:43.297 --> 31:44.564
They knew about
the other four bombs.

31:44.631 --> 31:45.898
They found out
from a web page.

31:45.964 --> 31:48.030
What?

31:48.097 --> 31:49.931
The cell phone had
a browser on it.

31:49.998 --> 31:51.898
The cache had a web page.
It wasn't public,

31:51.964 --> 31:53.264
but they could've
connected in.

31:53.330 --> 31:54.764
Was the Web site
password protected?

31:54.831 --> 31:56.264
No. These pages
come and go.

31:56.330 --> 31:58.297
But a lot of people
know about them.

31:58.364 --> 32:00.931
These guys aren't terrorists--
they're just spectators.

32:00.998 --> 32:02.397
Why didn't they report
the Web site?

32:02.464 --> 32:03.731
Because you have them locked up

32:03.797 --> 32:05.264
for having
terrorist links!

32:05.330 --> 32:07.030
Why would they
give you information

32:07.097 --> 32:08.898
that, in your eyes, would
incriminate them even further.

32:08.964 --> 32:10.797
All right, thanks, Chloe.

32:10.864 --> 32:11.797
I'm getting Walid

32:11.864 --> 32:13.230
the hell out of there.

32:13.297 --> 32:14.664
This is Agent Samuels.

32:14.731 --> 32:16.163
Notify the guards.

32:16.230 --> 32:18.797
We are taking
Walid Al-Rezani out.

32:21.364 --> 32:25.330
I was at home with my
wife and my children,

32:25.397 --> 32:27.764
and they barged right in
and the grabbed me.

32:27.831 --> 32:28.931
No search warrant,

32:28.998 --> 32:31.130
nothing.

32:31.197 --> 32:34.464
And they say this country
is about freedom.

32:34.531 --> 32:35.898
This is not freedom.

32:35.964 --> 32:37.230
My phone.

32:37.297 --> 32:40.230
It's gone.
What do you mean it's gone?

32:40.297 --> 32:41.464
I just had it over there.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.230
You... You took it.

32:48.297 --> 32:50.230
No, I did not take your phone.

32:50.297 --> 32:51.397
Yes, he did.

32:51.464 --> 32:53.464
I was walking back here.

32:53.531 --> 32:54.631
He fell in front of me.

32:56.097 --> 32:58.230
Search him.

32:58.297 --> 33:00.130
No, get away from me.

33:01.998 --> 33:03.664
Open the gate.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.697
Can't do that, ma'am.
I need to get in
there right now.

33:07.731 --> 33:08.797
What are you doing?

33:10.597 --> 33:11.764
You spied on us?

33:11.831 --> 33:13.931
You're worse than they are!

33:13.998 --> 33:17.097
You son of a bitch!
Heydar, no!

33:17.163 --> 33:18.697
(shouting)

33:21.397 --> 33:23.998
Let us in.

33:40.297 --> 33:44.230
(clamoring)

33:49.430 --> 33:52.831
Walid, Walid.

33:52.898 --> 33:55.130
Oh, my God.

33:55.197 --> 33:56.297
I'm okay.

33:56.364 --> 33:57.364
Oh, no, no, you're not.
You're hurt.

33:57.430 --> 33:58.464
I need a medical team
on site now.

33:58.531 --> 34:01.330
I've got a civilian down.

34:16.231 --> 34:17.130
--CTU. O'Brian.

34:17.197 --> 34:18.397
Chloe, we're here.

34:18.463 --> 34:20.730
The parking lot's almost empty.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.297
Yeah, the building's been
evacuated because of the bomb.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.730
Does Jack want us in there?

34:24.797 --> 34:26.164
No, hold your positions.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.362
Keep an eye on all the
exits and entrances;
wait for my call.

34:28.429 --> 34:30.197
All right. Standing by.

34:48.897 --> 34:50.630
Which one's his office?

34:50.697 --> 34:51.964
Last door on the right.

35:06.630 --> 35:07.897
Let's go.

35:17.897 --> 35:19.164
Take a seat.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.630
What are you doing?

35:32.697 --> 35:33.664
I'm looking for anything

35:33.730 --> 35:34.797
in McCarthy's system

35:34.864 --> 35:36.997
that connects him
to BXJ or the nukes.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.497
What's that?

35:41.564 --> 35:42.564
That's McCarthy's employment

35:42.630 --> 35:45.298
contract with BXJ.

35:45.363 --> 35:46.330
Whoa, whoa! What happened there?

35:46.397 --> 35:49.831
Some kind of electronic
shredding trail.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.330
Look at the time code.

35:51.397 --> 35:53.231
Ten minutes after
the bomb went off,

35:53.298 --> 35:54.530
McCarthy started
shredding files.

35:54.597 --> 35:55.831
(door bangs)

35:55.897 --> 35:58.363
(whispers):
Get up... now.

36:07.298 --> 36:08.231
Come on, Jack!

36:08.298 --> 36:09.597
Don't make a noise.

36:29.264 --> 36:30.430
(light tap)

36:44.131 --> 36:46.430
(louder tap)

36:58.597 --> 36:59.564
Don't you move.

36:59.630 --> 37:01.097
(grunts)

37:03.397 --> 37:04.797
Stop.

37:07.697 --> 37:08.630
You know him?

37:08.697 --> 37:11.397
Yeah.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.430
He's my son.

37:14.231 --> 37:17.831
I'm surprised to see you
here, Jack.

37:17.897 --> 37:22.797
We all feared
the worst.

37:22.864 --> 37:24.497
Give me my gun back.

37:28.831 --> 37:30.430
What are you doing here, Jack?

37:30.497 --> 37:33.264
I'm working with CTU.

37:33.363 --> 37:34.363
We're looking
for Darren McCarthy.

37:34.430 --> 37:37.198
McCarthy's not here.

37:37.264 --> 37:38.397
I know what you're trying
to cover up, Dad.

37:38.463 --> 37:39.430
Gray already told me.

37:39.497 --> 37:42.097
Did he? And where is he?

37:42.164 --> 37:43.797
McCarthy's office.

37:43.864 --> 37:47.697
There's nothing there, Jack,
believe me.

37:47.764 --> 37:48.697
Get Graem in here.

37:48.764 --> 37:50.097
Wait.

37:53.864 --> 37:55.463
You'll need these.

37:57.497 --> 37:59.031
I didn't trust him not to run.

38:02.897 --> 38:04.363
I'm doing everything I can
to find McCarthy.

38:04.430 --> 38:05.630
What in the hell
are you thinking,

38:05.697 --> 38:07.231
trying to do this
on your own?

38:07.298 --> 38:09.198
I only learned about it
yesterday.

38:09.264 --> 38:11.530
When Graem told me
about the diverted weapons...

38:11.597 --> 38:12.630
The second you knew
the bombs were missing,

38:12.697 --> 38:14.031
why didn't you call
the authorities?

38:14.097 --> 38:17.097
He told me that the bombs
couldn't be detonated;

38:17.164 --> 38:18.664
the triggers were deactivated.

38:18.730 --> 38:19.764
He was wrong.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.164
Evidently!

38:24.298 --> 38:26.764
Look, Jack,
I'm just trying

38:26.831 --> 38:29.131
to keep my son
out of prison.

38:29.198 --> 38:30.530
Dad, where is McCarthy?

38:30.597 --> 38:31.864
I don't know.

38:31.931 --> 38:33.831
When I do, we can

38:33.897 --> 38:35.397
pick him up together.

38:35.463 --> 38:36.797
That's not what he wants, Dad.
He wants us both in prison.

38:36.864 --> 38:38.564
What I want
is to find the nukes.

38:38.630 --> 38:40.897
If you're held accountable
for what you've done,

38:40.964 --> 38:42.363
that's the bed you've made.

38:42.430 --> 38:43.997
You hear that, Dad?

38:44.064 --> 38:45.497
You hear that family love?
We'd be better off

38:45.564 --> 38:49.097
if he was still rotting away
in a Chinese jail.

38:49.164 --> 38:50.198
Who are you calling?

38:50.264 --> 38:51.198
CTU.

38:51.264 --> 38:53.730
Jack, look, work with me.

38:53.797 --> 38:55.497
I'll tell you
what I know,

38:55.564 --> 38:57.164
but for now,
keep Graem out of it.

39:00.564 --> 39:02.864
We're talking about
prison, Jack.

39:02.931 --> 39:04.264
He's your brother.

39:04.330 --> 39:05.997
Graem knew what
he was doing was wrong.

39:06.064 --> 39:07.730
He was responsible
for those nukes.

39:07.797 --> 39:09.164
He should have been
more careful.

39:09.231 --> 39:10.198
And the second he knew
they were stolen,

39:10.264 --> 39:11.397
he should have reported it!

39:11.463 --> 39:13.530
Oh, you always do what
you should, right, Jack?

39:13.597 --> 39:14.764
How about when Dad needed you

39:14.831 --> 39:17.097
and you disappeared?

39:17.164 --> 39:19.064
Come on, Jack, give us a chance
to clean this up.

39:19.131 --> 39:21.330
Dad, there are four more bombs
out there.

39:21.397 --> 39:23.430
I cannot-- I will not--
be responsible

39:23.497 --> 39:25.564
for thousands and thousands
of lives just

39:25.630 --> 39:26.897
to try and protect
this family.

39:26.964 --> 39:29.597
Wrong! Protecting family is
everything, and I think

39:29.664 --> 39:31.298
your dead wife
would agree.
You son of a bitch!

39:31.363 --> 39:33.131
Jack!

39:35.231 --> 39:36.564
All right,

39:36.630 --> 39:37.964
let's do it your way.

39:38.031 --> 39:40.064
No, Dad!
No, no, no,
he's right.

39:40.131 --> 39:41.964
Call CTU.

39:45.630 --> 39:47.931
I don't think so.

39:49.198 --> 39:51.530
Hey, what are you doing?!

39:51.597 --> 39:53.730
Put the gun away.

39:53.797 --> 39:55.264
You work for me.

39:55.330 --> 39:57.231
No, Dad, he doesn't.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.831
This is insane.

40:01.897 --> 40:03.363
You don't think
I'd let you run loose

40:03.430 --> 40:04.897
without keeping an eye
on you, do you?

40:04.964 --> 40:06.997
Tell them to put the guns away.

40:07.064 --> 40:08.797
Shut up, Dad.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.298
Well, I'm glad we can

40:11.363 --> 40:13.097
all finally put our cards
on the table.

40:14.964 --> 40:17.831
Family. (scoffs)
Let's go.

40:28.463 --> 40:31.264
Yeah, talk to me.

40:31.330 --> 40:33.064
Yeah, so?

40:33.131 --> 40:36.330
You think you can get him?

40:36.397 --> 40:37.964
And he hasn't left town?

40:38.031 --> 40:44.164
Okay, text me everything
you've got on him.

40:44.231 --> 40:45.463
They're
looking for you

40:45.530 --> 40:47.264
at your place.

40:47.330 --> 40:49.064
What makes you think
they can't find you here?

40:49.131 --> 40:50.831
A: Because I'm not that stupid,

40:50.897 --> 40:52.864
and B: Because we're not going
to be here long enough

40:52.931 --> 40:54.298
for anyone to know.

40:54.363 --> 40:56.997
I really hope you know
what you're doing, Darren.

40:57.064 --> 41:00.231
Always.

41:00.298 --> 41:02.198
And when I'm done
with this deal,

41:02.264 --> 41:04.564
I may just buy you
a small country.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.597
As long as it's not
Palm Springs.

41:17.831 --> 41:19.264
Everything's been handled.

41:19.330 --> 41:20.530
We're clear to go.

41:20.597 --> 41:22.530
Good. Let's move.

41:58.430 --> 42:00.164
Good God.

42:00.231 --> 42:02.430
What have you done?

42:02.497 --> 42:04.564
Jack forced my hand.

42:05.597 --> 42:06.964
Call me when it's over.
