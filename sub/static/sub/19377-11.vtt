00:21.688 --> 00:24.524
[chorus singing] <i>Open your eyes</i>
<i>This destiny</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:27.694
<i>If I can't escape it</i>

00:27.761 --> 00:29.496
<i>Then I'll swallow it all down</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:33.800
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And I'll fight</i>

00:34.067 --> 00:35.435
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:40.507 --> 00:43.510
<i>The menace that dominates</i>

00:43.577 --> 00:46.613
<i>The darkness in my troubled mind</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:49.750
<i>The truth of a human</i>

00:49.816 --> 00:52.753
<i>Who has begun to lose control</i>

00:52.819 --> 00:55.255
<i>That meaninglessness</i>

00:55.322 --> 00:58.625
<i>I've come to know it</i>

00:59.192 --> 01:01.528
<i>If even counterfeit peace</i>

01:01.695 --> 01:05.265
<i>Will break into pieces</i>

01:05.332 --> 01:09.703
<i>I will cast</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:16.610
<i>A defiant shadow</i>

01:17.477 --> 01:20.480
<i>It's the end of escape</i>
<i>Stand up</i>

01:20.547 --> 01:23.550
<i>Because it's the only way</i>

01:23.617 --> 01:29.723
<i>Follow it</i>
<i>The small hope I aim for</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:32.793
<i>The weakness that spilled</i>
<i>From the proffered hand</i>

01:32.859 --> 01:36.196
<i>I swallowed it all down</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:42.669
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And lost my mind</i>

01:46.473 --> 01:50.477
AT THIS RATE IT REALLY WILL BE WAR!

01:51.478 --> 01:55.215
<i>The government, which has only</i>
<i>declared a state of emergency until now</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:58.719
<i>announced "a national crisis"</i>
<i>in response to the Ajin Sato's</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:01.355
<i>occupation of the Self Defense Force base.</i>

02:01.822 --> 02:05.692
<i>Cooperation with the United States</i>
<i>has also come under consideration.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:06.793
Okay.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.297
I'm fine, Mom, so don't worry.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.732
[woman 1] <i>Wha-- What should we do...</i>

02:12.466 --> 02:14.368
-<i>Shouldn't we get away too...?</i>
-Bye.

02:14.868 --> 02:20.307
<i>I mean, I'm scared too, but we can't</i>
<i>just leave our patients...</i>

02:27.447 --> 02:29.916
[man] <i>As long as they have the hostages</i>
<i>and chemical weapons,</i>

02:30.183 --> 02:31.685
<i>we can't afford to make mistakes.</i>

02:31.785 --> 02:34.321
-<i>Wait for orders from the top.</i>
-Roger.

02:35.355 --> 02:36.857
[explosion nearby]

02:46.266 --> 02:49.336
Hmm... Right, just as the map says.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.670
Perfect.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.844
Just a teaspoon of the nerve gas
that the Ajin possess

02:58.178 --> 03:02.449
is capable of killing every human
within a 100-meter radius.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.483
It's that bad?

03:03.550 --> 03:06.486
If it's released all over the country,

03:06.753 --> 03:09.289
the entire population of Japan
could be wiped out.

03:10.323 --> 03:13.693
Isn't the missile in the video
a short-range one?

03:14.594 --> 03:17.564
Just now, I received a call from the
commanding officer

03:17.631 --> 03:20.700
of the U.S. forces in Japan
requesting joint operations.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.470
America's sending
a military intervention

03:23.537 --> 03:25.539
in response
to a domestic terrorist threat?

03:25.605 --> 03:27.407
That's a violation
of national sovereignty!

03:27.507 --> 03:31.511
They don't see it as a domestic conflict,
but as a Far East emergency.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.714
The president has issued
an official communiqué.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.228
I'm gonna go get Nagai after all...

03:48.628 --> 03:52.666
He might come up with a great strategy
for us, and he has his ghost.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.569
Leave him.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.638
I won't do it.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.273
What did you say?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.375
There's no way we can win now.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.610
It's pointless.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.314
So you want us to just watch silently
and do nothing?

04:07.380 --> 04:10.417
If this country does become
an independent Ajin state,

04:10.717 --> 04:12.786
it may be easier
for me to live in anyway.

04:12.853 --> 04:16.790
I always knew you were selfish,
but I didn't realize just how much.

04:16.857 --> 04:21.361
You're only interested in saving
your own fiancée too, right?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.596
You bastard!

04:22.863 --> 04:23.730
Nagai!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.599
Is that really what you want?!

04:25.932 --> 04:28.368
Huh? Of course it is.

04:32.005 --> 04:32.939
You're trash!

04:37.677 --> 04:38.812
Yeah.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.281
I know that.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.888
He's finished...

04:49.022 --> 04:50.791
He can't even summon his IBM anymore.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.461
He's useless.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.403
[woman on computer] <i>Sources tell us</i>
<i>that the government is taking a stance</i>

05:03.570 --> 05:07.440
<i>of more comprehensive cooperation with the</i>
<i>U.S. in response to Ajin Sato's threat.</i>

05:07.707 --> 05:09.476
<i>Joint operations with the U.S. military...</i>

05:09.543 --> 05:10.410
[chuckles]

05:10.477 --> 05:11.978
[Tanaka] Hey, even the Americans
are butting in now...

05:12.646 --> 05:15.348
They're really getting shaken up.

05:15.415 --> 05:19.419
Now that we've gone this far, the
government has to listen to our demands.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.588
Right, Mr. Sato?

05:22.088 --> 05:26.059
Yes, I'm sure they'll be contacting us
any minute now.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.495
[phone ringing]

05:31.331 --> 05:31.998
Told you.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.001
I'm Field Officer Kouma, of the JGSDF.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.870
I'll be in charge of negotiations.

05:36.937 --> 05:37.971
<i>This is Sato.</i>

05:38.471 --> 05:43.610
<i>Why, it's an honor to be able to speak</i>
<i>with such a senior officer directly.</i>

05:43.977 --> 05:45.579
I'll get directly to the point.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.115
The government considers
the people's safety its top priority.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.518
We'll designate the uninhabited islands

05:51.585 --> 05:53.887
in the south of Kyushu
or a part of Hokkaido

05:54.454 --> 05:56.656
as an independent territory for Ajin.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.726
All right! We did it...!

06:00.093 --> 06:01.628
Incredible!

06:02.862 --> 06:03.763
Mr. Sato!

06:03.830 --> 06:04.965
[chuckles]

06:05.565 --> 06:07.467
I'm glad to hear it.

06:07.901 --> 06:11.838
These are the most extreme measures
we are able to take.

06:12.505 --> 06:16.509
Therefore, we'd like to begin discussions
for you to disarm--

06:16.576 --> 06:17.777
<i>But I'm afraid it won't do.</i>

06:33.126 --> 06:34.427
Wha-- What is it?!

06:34.494 --> 06:35.729
What did they do?!

06:36.630 --> 06:38.932
Apparently one of the missiles
has been launched.

06:39.065 --> 06:39.933
Heading where?!

06:40.867 --> 06:43.069
[explosion nearby then all shouting]

06:49.442 --> 06:51.511
That was just
to drive the threat home, right?

06:51.578 --> 06:52.445
No.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.115
I never heard anything
about actually firing these...

06:55.749 --> 06:57.083
What's going on?

06:58.985 --> 07:00.520
Wh-- What is this?

07:03.623 --> 07:06.660
[groans] Is that a poison gas missile?

07:08.561 --> 07:10.864
-No, it can't be...!
-Hurry, get a damage report!

07:10.931 --> 07:12.832
Have security check the defensive walls!

07:14.534 --> 07:16.569
[Sato] <i>Colonel Kouma, right?</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:20.874
I'm not asking for something
conventional like that.

07:21.141 --> 07:25.078
What I want is this entire country.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.151
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:33.119
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

07:34.220 --> 07:36.156
<i>Evacuate Japan.</i>

07:37.557 --> 07:40.226
<i>You run out of time in three days.</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:43.730
<i>If the Japanese government</i>
<i>or the U.S. military</i>

07:44.764 --> 07:46.967
<i>rejects our demands,</i>

07:47.067 --> 07:49.502
<i>then they can come risk their lives</i>
<i>to stop us.</i>

07:50.070 --> 07:53.673
However, no aerial bombings.

07:54.541 --> 07:58.812
<i>If we see any suspicious aircraft</i>
<i>within a 3-kilometer radius,</i>

07:59.145 --> 08:00.747
<i>we'll fire the missiles.</i>

08:01.982 --> 08:06.586
<i>Even if this country is covered</i>
<i>in a cloud of poison gas...</i>

08:06.786 --> 08:08.989
<i>the Ajin alone will survive.</i>

08:10.857 --> 08:11.725
Move out.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.229
<i>We will become the rulers of this country.</i>

08:19.165 --> 08:21.501
END TRANSMISSION

08:23.937 --> 08:25.505
Wha-- What are you doing?!

08:25.772 --> 08:28.174
At this rate it really will be war!

08:28.241 --> 08:29.976
Whatever do you mean, Tanaka?

08:30.610 --> 08:32.579
Haven't I been saying it from the start?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.015
This is a war.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.221
I-- I can't go along with this.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.890
You can't just pull out now.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.293
Desertion is a serious violation
of the rules.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.562
Then what are you gonna do about it?!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.865
You gonna lock every one of us up?!

08:52.532 --> 08:53.233
Let's see...

08:57.871 --> 08:58.738
Mr. Sato...

08:59.139 --> 09:00.073
What are you doing?

09:00.740 --> 09:04.544
If I felt like it, I could cut off
all your heads.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.579
Mr. Sato...

09:07.647 --> 09:08.748
Why?

09:10.016 --> 09:11.017
Finally...

09:11.951 --> 09:14.120
Finally Japan is listening to us!

09:14.821 --> 09:19.726
We've worked so hard for that,
for a future for Ajin...

09:19.793 --> 09:22.695
I don't care about any of that.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.833
All I care about is excitement.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.869
That's what we're fighting for.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.306
Mr. Sato...

09:34.808 --> 09:36.709
You're out of your mind...

09:37.877 --> 09:38.978
[chuckles]

09:41.648 --> 09:42.849
AJIN SATO BOMBS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE

09:42.916 --> 09:45.151
<i>The area within a 1-kilometer radius</i>
<i>of the Prime Minister's residence</i>

09:45.218 --> 09:47.187
<i>is currently closed off</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:50.156
<i>as the chemical protection unit</i>
<i>continues to work tirelessly!</i>

09:50.223 --> 09:51.758
[crowd] This is seriously bad!

09:51.825 --> 09:53.660
Where can we run?!

09:53.893 --> 09:56.796
<i>The government has ordered citizens</i>
<i>to seek shelter indoors.</i>

10:05.805 --> 10:07.240
You guys go on ahead.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.142
I'll keep a lookout behind.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.683
Sato's gone completely nuts...

10:27.894 --> 10:30.630
Okuyama, you okay with this?

10:30.697 --> 10:33.233
There's no point in playing war games
forever.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.370
But what'll we do now?

10:38.171 --> 10:42.075
This won't go down well
if Sato catches us...

10:43.076 --> 10:44.677
I have an idea about that.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.288
<i>As unrest continues to grip the country,</i>

10:55.822 --> 10:59.292
<i>some people are turning violent</i>
<i>and incidents of attacks on the family</i>

10:59.425 --> 11:02.962
<i>of Ajin have been occurring under</i>
<i>the pretext of so-called Ajin hunts.</i>

11:04.130 --> 11:05.298
AJIN HUNTERS ATTACK FAMILIES OF AJIN

11:05.365 --> 11:08.268
<i>The families of the Ajin Tanaka and Nagai</i>
<i>are already under protection,</i>

11:08.334 --> 11:10.870
<i>but the status of Kei Nagai's</i>
<i>younger sister is unknown.</i>

11:10.937 --> 11:11.804
NAGAI ERIKO (14)

11:11.871 --> 11:15.708
<i>There are reports that rioters have</i>
<i>mobbed the facility she is hospitalized.</i>

11:22.882 --> 11:24.450
[crowd] Where's Nagai's sister?

11:24.717 --> 11:26.185
Where is she?!

11:26.252 --> 11:28.321
-Stop this!
-Calm down!

11:29.088 --> 11:30.757
-Where is she?
-She isn't here!

11:30.823 --> 11:31.691
Find her!

11:39.966 --> 11:41.701
[muffled screaming]

11:42.235 --> 11:43.102
Eri!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.039
K-- Kei?

11:46.105 --> 11:47.407
Let's go, Eri.

11:47.740 --> 11:48.908
Don't touch me!

11:50.243 --> 11:51.277
Whose fault is this?!

11:52.111 --> 11:54.414
Who do you think got me into this mess?!

11:54.480 --> 11:56.082
Idiot, be quiet!

11:56.149 --> 11:57.016
Stop it!

11:57.417 --> 11:58.351
What are you doing?!

11:58.818 --> 12:00.753
-Why did you come here?!
-There she is!

12:01.854 --> 12:02.855
Hey, isn't that--

12:02.989 --> 12:04.090
It's Nagai!

12:04.157 --> 12:05.158
It's Kei Nagai!

12:05.224 --> 12:06.159
Hurry!

12:06.826 --> 12:07.894
<i>Should I use my voice?!</i>

12:08.227 --> 12:10.363
<i>But then even Eri</i>
<i>won't be able to move...</i>

12:16.002 --> 12:17.503
Hey! Got him!

12:21.140 --> 12:22.742
Serves you right!

12:22.809 --> 12:23.943
Let's do this!

12:24.243 --> 12:25.745
The Ajin hunt is on!

12:26.913 --> 12:27.981
[Eri] N-- No!

12:30.450 --> 12:31.317
Kei?

12:32.752 --> 12:33.486
[Nagai] <i>Come out!</i>

12:34.487 --> 12:36.222
<i>Ghost!</i>

12:38.825 --> 12:39.993
[gasps]

12:53.439 --> 12:55.141
-Kai!..
-Come on!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.310
Damn it, this is bad.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.268
Are you feeling better now?

13:26.839 --> 13:27.507
Then let's go.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.444
I can't go all the way to the police,
but I can take you close.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.279
-But--
-Wait.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.416
Kei.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.851
Run with us.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.286
Kai.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.555
I saw it on the news.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.457
It's been rough, right?

13:44.857 --> 13:46.926
-'Cause of that Sato guy.
-So?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.062
It has nothing to do with you.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.196
Hey, Kei!

13:50.563 --> 13:51.864
Shut up, Eri.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.966
But you shouldn't talk to Kai like--

13:54.033 --> 13:54.901
Shut up.

13:56.302 --> 13:59.972
With his connections,
we can escape to India.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.409
This time let's really escape together.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.446
You're still saying that?

14:07.213 --> 14:08.114
What's wrong?

14:09.215 --> 14:12.952
I'm not the same as I was before.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.889
No matter what I do,
I keep having to fight,

14:18.024 --> 14:20.193
and so many people have died
before my eyes.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.362
It's become clear to me now.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.432
I don't need any unnecessary feelings.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.569
It's stupid to get carried away
by emotion.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.505
-Kei...
-Don't you get it, Kai?!

14:33.072 --> 14:35.308
You saved me, and I abandoned you!

14:35.608 --> 14:38.277
You got thrown into juvenile hall
because of me!

14:39.412 --> 14:41.247
-I guess.
-So just...

14:41.914 --> 14:43.449
So just leave me alone!

14:44.317 --> 14:45.451
But we're friends, right?

14:48.354 --> 14:49.522
You're my friend, Kei.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.997
You really still think that.

14:58.664 --> 14:59.565
Of course I do.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.269
You really haven't changed...

15:05.371 --> 15:09.942
You haven't changed
since we were kids, Kai...

15:10.977 --> 15:11.644
That so?

15:19.085 --> 15:19.952
Thank you.

15:20.586 --> 15:24.056
Okay, so it's decided.
We'll go ahead with the plan.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.145
That guy's an idiot, huh?

15:47.413 --> 15:50.116
Yeah, he is.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.251
He's such an idiot.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.455
He said you'd definitely
go to your sister...

15:56.489 --> 15:58.224
so we had to go rescue you.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.393
Insisted on it.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.596
Even though you abandoned him.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.106
Yeah.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.576
There's something wrong with him.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.512
-Ah? You--
-All I've ever done

16:19.745 --> 16:21.481
is try to be a successful person.

16:22.281 --> 16:26.519
And I've chosen only what I needed
to that end.

16:27.753 --> 16:28.621
And yet...

16:30.623 --> 16:36.329
And yet that weirdo was my only friend.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.734
[scoffs] What's up with that?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.640
Can I ask you a favor?

17:00.553 --> 17:03.022
Eri, I'm sorry.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.428
You went through a lot of trouble
because of me.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.565
What's all this, all of the sudden...?

17:12.632 --> 17:13.499
I'm really sorry.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.035
Whatever. It's fine...

17:16.102 --> 17:18.237
But at least when you're running away,
be quiet.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.805
It was stupid to yell like that.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.475
That was because you showed up
out of nowhere.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.448
-Uh, Kai.
-What is it?

17:29.515 --> 17:31.450
Sorry to ask at a time like this...

17:33.185 --> 17:35.688
but I've really gotta pee.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.758
Ah. Okay, I'll stop on the side.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.701
Kei's taking a long time.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.406
I'm gonna check on him.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.674
There's no point.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.509
That's a long piss.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.780
He asked you to take care of his sister.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.382
What do you mean...?!

18:03.783 --> 18:04.650
Kei.

18:05.318 --> 18:10.222
You're an idiot,
but your friend's an idiot too.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.425
Shut up.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.861
He's not an idiot.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.778
[humming]

18:36.382 --> 18:38.384
You sure seem to be having fun.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.854
Are those games really that fun?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.458
Yeah.

18:45.758 --> 18:50.396
The higher the difficulty, the greater
the satisfaction when you clear it.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.233
Did you do it on purpose?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.504
Did you set it up so they'd betray you?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.541
[laughs] You say the funniest things,
Tanaka.

19:03.175 --> 19:06.712
Did you think that would make
your game more fun?

19:07.346 --> 19:10.182
Well, it's true that the fewer allies
you have

19:10.449 --> 19:13.219
the more people you can kill yourself.

19:17.723 --> 19:18.724
Mr. Sato,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.394
you really are a fool.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.697
You're not the person
I thought you were,

19:25.197 --> 19:27.800
and I have no clue what you're
thinking.

19:28.768 --> 19:29.635
But...

19:30.469 --> 19:31.604
[gasps

19:35.374 --> 19:37.376
The Player 2 slot is open.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.179
[chuckles]

19:43.849 --> 19:45.251
[groaning]

19:46.218 --> 19:49.221
Mr. Tosaki,
maybe you should rest a little...

19:49.288 --> 19:49.955
I'm fine.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.825
[sighs]

20:01.634 --> 20:05.638
I never thought you'd attack a tank
with a spear.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.373
There's nothing else
we can do...

20:08.874 --> 20:10.710
Just like Don Quixote.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.518
Nagai!

20:22.254 --> 20:23.456
[Tosaki] Why did you come back?

20:24.457 --> 20:25.491
It should be obvious.

20:26.592 --> 20:30.896
You need my help to stop Sato.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.431
Don't make me laugh!

20:32.832 --> 20:33.699
Mr. Tosaki!

20:33.999 --> 20:35.801
Just what can you do for us now?!

20:35.868 --> 20:42.274
I know that you don't trust me,
and I don't care.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.677
But...

20:47.580 --> 20:49.548
I'm going to stop Sato.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.717
Because that's what I should do.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.259
[man] Target confirmed.

21:01.327 --> 21:01.994
Breach.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.408
It's a trap!

21:22.982 --> 21:25.551
To be continued

21:26.719 --> 21:29.755
[chorus singing]
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

21:29.822 --> 21:33.025
<i>I'll trade it</i>

21:33.292 --> 21:38.430
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

21:39.565 --> 21:45.771
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

21:45.871 --> 21:51.544
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

21:52.344 --> 21:56.448
<i>You can see them all</i>

21:58.651 --> 22:02.988
<i>When you come to my house</i>

22:03.055 --> 22:09.094
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

22:09.361 --> 22:11.463
<i>While the wind blows</i>

22:11.530 --> 22:15.734
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:24.043
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

22:24.109 --> 22:30.549
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

22:30.616 --> 22:36.522
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

22:36.989 --> 22:39.758
<i>"Be my friend</i>

22:39.825 --> 22:46.665
<i>Always"</i>
