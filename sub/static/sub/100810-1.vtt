01:10.237 --> 01:12.039
May God have mercy.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.588
Yay though I walk through the valley

01:26.621 --> 01:28.388
of the shadow of death,

01:29.491 --> 01:33.595
I fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

01:33.628 --> 01:36.296
Thy rod, thy staff, comfort me.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.350
Hello, Father.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.652
What took you so long?

02:02.757 --> 02:04.492
Hello, Lieutenant.

02:09.631 --> 02:12.834
Your friend Garvan is in here with us.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.602
We were never friends.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.610
Your buddy wants to talk to you but,

02:22.644 --> 02:23.711
you better give me a moment.

02:23.745 --> 02:25.647
It's a little crowded in here.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.259
No!

02:47.367 --> 02:49.704
Come clean, you motherfucker!

02:54.842 --> 02:57.579
You think that's gonna save you?

02:59.414 --> 03:00.247
If you're lucky.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.115
The devil always wins.

03:13.828 --> 03:17.699
Forgive me Father, for what I'm about to do.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.526
Burn in hell.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.473
What?

04:33.841 --> 04:35.175
What happened?

04:36.444 --> 04:38.245
You were possessed.

04:38.980 --> 04:39.847
It's over.

04:40.882 --> 04:41.749
He's gone.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.219
My wife?

04:53.728 --> 04:57.732
No!

04:59.667 --> 05:00.535
Oh God!

05:05.406 --> 05:07.340
What about my children?

05:13.781 --> 05:14.782
Good God no!

05:17.585 --> 05:19.352
What about my mother?

05:20.722 --> 05:22.957
And my father.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.693
My grandfather.

05:25.727 --> 05:28.796
My.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.899
What did I do?

05:45.880 --> 05:48.449
They're all dead.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.384
I...

05:53.554 --> 05:54.822
It wasn't you.

05:55.957 --> 05:56.891
It was him.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.861
He made you do it.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.865
Bring the body outside.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.790
That's one way to do it.

09:44.218 --> 09:46.020
See that?

09:47.221 --> 09:49.023
I was a captain, right off the bat.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.560
I'd heard.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.029
Yeah, it was about 4,000.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.000
Look at that moon.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.136
Hard to believe, for 40 years

10:02.169 --> 10:04.672
I've been flying these unfriendly skies.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.809
Yep, I remember when we first met.

10:08.843 --> 10:11.746
I was just a young, foxy copilot

10:11.779 --> 10:13.948
with vim and vinegar in my veins.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.685
Two decades later, and I'm still a fuckin' copilot.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.956
You of course, are the big honcho,

10:21.989 --> 10:23.858
the big man in the sky.

10:23.891 --> 10:24.992
El Capitan de Cloudos.

10:26.594 --> 10:28.963
Yes, it's all true, it's me.

10:28.996 --> 10:29.864
That's me.

10:30.765 --> 10:32.133
Anyway,

10:34.035 --> 10:36.070
I was saving this for when we landed.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.106
I bought it the first time I ever took over this route.

10:41.809 --> 10:42.743
Smell that.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.578
Oh.

10:53.287 --> 10:54.555
Sweet, you?

10:56.057 --> 10:57.058
Come on.

10:57.091 --> 10:57.925
You really shouldn't.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.326
Last chance.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.028
There you go.

11:01.062 --> 11:01.929
Hoo.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.704
Oh!

11:10.738 --> 11:11.639
That's smooth.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.941
Welcome to Viet Kong Airways.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.811
My name is Amanda, I'm your hostess.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.246
If you need anything, ask him.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.382
Welcome to Viet Kong Airways.

11:21.416 --> 11:23.784
I'm Denny, if you need anything,

11:23.818 --> 11:24.885
please ask Amanda.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.189
40-F.

11:28.222 --> 11:30.925
Oh yeah, straight on the left.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.793
Hi there, ah thank you.

11:32.827 --> 11:33.761
That's a nice vest.

11:34.895 --> 11:35.963
Thank you so much.

11:37.231 --> 11:37.998
Hear that honey?

11:38.032 --> 11:39.733
Fucking bullshit you couldn't get

11:39.767 --> 11:40.968
two seats next to each other.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.236
We shoulda canceled.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.772
It's a hiccup, sweetheart.

11:44.805 --> 11:45.673
All right?

11:46.807 --> 11:47.908
Vietnam's gonna be fun.

11:47.942 --> 11:50.144
Oh yeah, some second honeymoon.

11:53.681 --> 11:55.883
Honey, please don't start our vacation with that attitude.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.086
We're flying standby and that's what happens.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.654
Welcome.

12:00.688 --> 12:02.923
Look honey, a real airplane.

12:02.957 --> 12:05.659
Put a smile on that face.

12:05.693 --> 12:06.760
Excuse me sir!

12:08.395 --> 12:10.231
Hey, hi,

12:10.264 --> 12:13.334
would you mind switching seats with my husband?

12:34.088 --> 12:36.157
Excuse me sir, do you mind switching seats

12:36.190 --> 12:37.024
with my husband?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.859
His seat is all the way in the back,

12:38.893 --> 12:41.762
and it's actually right next to the toilet.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.930
- It's a really good seat. - Ma'am?

12:42.963 --> 12:43.931
Would you mind?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.332
- Yeah. - What's going on?

12:45.366 --> 12:48.035
I want to switch seats with him.

12:48.068 --> 12:48.969
No seat switches.

12:49.003 --> 12:51.872
Oh yeah but if he's willing to switch,

12:51.906 --> 12:52.873
what difference does it make?

12:52.907 --> 12:54.476
All right, airplane rules.

12:54.509 --> 12:57.412
Rules are rules honey, I'll sit in my seat

12:57.445 --> 13:00.147
and I will come back and visit you during the flight.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.249
You're handsome.

13:03.184 --> 13:04.118
You're very kind.

13:04.151 --> 13:04.985
Very sweet.

13:05.019 --> 13:05.920
Yeah, whatever.

13:05.953 --> 13:06.621
You're a pussy.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.189
Hey, no pussy on the plane.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.027
No pussy calling on the plane.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.262
Thanks honey, and thank you.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.931
Watch her.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.200
Aw, hey Brad, Brad.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.368
Oh my God, Brad.

13:21.403 --> 13:22.703
Hey, stop stop.

13:26.207 --> 13:27.041
Brad?

13:27.074 --> 13:28.242
Ma'am you talk too much,

13:28.275 --> 13:30.010
what you need to do is sit down.

13:30.044 --> 13:32.012
My God just sit in your seat.

13:35.517 --> 13:38.486
Welcome to King of the Sky, Viet Kong Airways.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.422
This is Pookie, my service dog.

13:42.790 --> 13:44.058
Wait, that dog dead.

13:44.858 --> 13:45.627
Dead?

13:45.660 --> 13:47.228
He can still provide a service.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.187
Is this plane going to Viet Nam?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.321
Father,

14:14.355 --> 14:16.056
welcome on board.

14:16.090 --> 14:16.524
Thank you.

14:16.558 --> 14:17.391
Yes,

14:17.425 --> 14:20.528
this plane goes to Ho Chi Minh City.

14:20.562 --> 14:22.229
Oh good good.

14:22.263 --> 14:25.799
But it's non-smoking flight.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.307
You don't know that?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.208
Here.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.109
Thank you.

14:36.611 --> 14:39.313
Father, forgive me for,

14:39.346 --> 14:44.084
I have sinned, not once but twice, for more.

14:44.118 --> 14:44.952
Good for you.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.087
I need to sit down.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.222
Okay, go.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.057
I'm a little dizzy.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.834
Brad.

15:00.868 --> 15:03.037
I feel kind of dirty.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.038
About what?

15:05.306 --> 15:07.274
Taking your seat wife.

15:10.978 --> 15:11.912
Oh, she's not my wife.

15:11.945 --> 15:15.517
She is my, she's my secretary.

15:15.550 --> 15:16.451
She works for me.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.921
I don't like to mix business with pleasure.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.428
Unless pleasure is your business.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.230
Yeah.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.462
This is Captain Houdee.

16:00.495 --> 16:04.164
Welcome to Viet Kong Airways, flight 665.

16:04.198 --> 16:08.369
This is the farewell flight of this Boeing 727.

16:08.403 --> 16:10.304
If it isn't Boeing, I ain't going,

16:10.337 --> 16:12.640
so consider yourselves the lucky ones.

16:12.674 --> 16:16.578
I've been flying this old bird for 27 years,

16:16.611 --> 16:19.079
and she's got a nearly spotless record.

16:19.113 --> 16:20.080
Nearly?

16:20.114 --> 16:22.450
So relax, and enjoy your flight.

16:22.484 --> 16:24.985
Would you like to read a magazine with mommy?

16:31.693 --> 16:33.160
Everything okay, ma'am?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.061
What's wrong?

16:35.095 --> 16:35.963
Nothing.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.232
Enjoy.

16:41.436 --> 16:42.437
Release the brakes.

16:42.470 --> 16:43.937
Aye aye, Captain.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.951
Hit it again?

17:46.601 --> 17:47.602
Want drink?

17:47.635 --> 17:49.369
Scotch, neat.

17:49.404 --> 17:51.673
I have something neat.

17:51.706 --> 17:52.574
A beer.

17:54.409 --> 17:55.477
You want something?

17:55.510 --> 17:58.446
Oh, just a hot water, please.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.980
I brought my own tea.

18:01.215 --> 18:02.282
Here.

18:02.316 --> 18:03.383
Namaste.

18:03.418 --> 18:05.185
Who you calling nasty?

18:05.219 --> 18:07.054
It mean, I bow to you.

18:10.525 --> 18:11.391
Hey.

18:21.703 --> 18:22.637
Excuse me.

18:26.541 --> 18:27.408
I'm sorry.

18:29.243 --> 18:31.144
I don't remember anyone sitting there.

18:33.715 --> 18:34.816
Must've fallen asleep.

18:34.849 --> 18:36.149
Where would I go, silly?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.418
I'm your travel buddy.

18:38.620 --> 18:41.523
Say, you want to play a round.

18:42.657 --> 18:45.325
What did you have in mind, gin rummy?

18:47.127 --> 18:47.795
Ouja.

18:57.539 --> 18:59.039
Oh, hey Matt Damon.

19:00.374 --> 19:01.308
So sweet.

19:02.443 --> 19:03.678
What would you like?

19:03.711 --> 19:05.178
I want a milk.

19:07.682 --> 19:08.816
Here you go.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.554
What would you like?

19:12.587 --> 19:14.221
Same.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.122
O,

19:16.356 --> 19:17.224
G,

19:19.159 --> 19:19.827
A,

19:21.429 --> 19:22.296
R,

19:23.464 --> 19:25.500
V, ooo, A,

19:26.901 --> 19:28.670
N, Garvan.

19:31.606 --> 19:33.408
Who the heck is Garvan?

19:33.441 --> 19:34.842
You know this thing usually works.

19:34.876 --> 19:37.344
It told me when my high school boyfriend was gonna die.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.948
Honey, you drink?

19:39.981 --> 19:42.584
Yes please, Diet Coke with just a little bit of ice

19:42.617 --> 19:43.451
and a flexy straw.

19:43.484 --> 19:45.553
I don't want to mess up my lipstick.

19:48.923 --> 19:49.757
Thank you.

19:49.791 --> 19:50.892
And a straw?

19:50.925 --> 19:52.727
What do I look like, Denny?

19:53.895 --> 19:55.430
Who's Denny?

19:55.463 --> 19:56.330
No straw.

19:57.331 --> 19:58.198
Drink, mister?

19:59.767 --> 20:01.134
Coffee, black please.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.804
No black coffee, just coffee no milk.

20:02.837 --> 20:04.639
That is black coffee.

20:04.672 --> 20:07.341
Look I just told you, we don't have black coffee,

20:07.374 --> 20:08.375
so which is it then?

20:10.645 --> 20:12.413
Coffee, without milk.

20:12.447 --> 20:13.648
So not black then, yes.

20:14.549 --> 20:15.883
Yes, I mean no.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.886
Yes, I mean no.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.288
Make up your mind, I have to make rounds.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.857
Never mind, you're confusing me.

20:24.525 --> 20:26.393
Bring me a Mary, Bloody.

20:26.427 --> 20:27.294
Okay, you got.

20:28.496 --> 20:30.932
- One Virgin Mary, Bloody. - Veronica.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.265
Hello, Veronica.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.367
I'm Father Romero.

20:33.401 --> 20:35.268
Pleasure to meet you, Father Romero.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.671
I know all about you guys.

20:36.704 --> 20:37.572
You do?

20:37.605 --> 20:39.874
Mm-hmm, I'm a fallen Catholic, myself.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.442
So I know how it all works.

20:41.476 --> 20:44.344
I do something bad, I go to confession.

20:44.378 --> 20:45.446
They tell me to put money in the basket,

20:45.480 --> 20:48.181
and say some prayers, and then I don't go to hell.

20:48.916 --> 20:49.584
Some racket, huh?

20:49.617 --> 20:51.853
I'll bet hell is a ton of fun.

20:51.886 --> 20:54.287
It's probably where all the cool people go.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.590
I mean who really wants to go to heaven

20:55.623 --> 20:58.660
with a bunch of blue-haired bingo players,

20:58.693 --> 20:59.961
and boring guys like you.

20:59.994 --> 21:00.728
No offense, Father.

21:00.762 --> 21:01.763
No, none taken.

21:01.796 --> 21:04.732
Just remember to keep a soft place in your heart

21:04.766 --> 21:06.233
for the almighty.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.935
My heart's rock hard, feel.

21:10.838 --> 21:11.939
That's pretty hard.

21:11.973 --> 21:13.508
Mm-hmm.

21:13.541 --> 21:15.342
You should really massage those puppies.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.745
You know, my plastic surgeon said the same thing.

21:17.779 --> 21:19.514
And my mom's boyfriend.

21:19.547 --> 21:20.882
So why are you going to Vietnam?

21:20.915 --> 21:22.917
Oh, vaginal rejuvenation.

21:23.918 --> 21:25.285
Is that like a yoga retreat?

21:25.318 --> 21:26.888
No silly, see?

21:32.994 --> 21:34.662
Oh my God.

21:34.696 --> 21:36.263
The doctor there's the best in the world.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.432
Says he's gonna make me tighter

21:37.465 --> 21:38.533
than a Chinese finger puzzle.

21:39.834 --> 21:42.302
Hey, you think that dog in first class in dead?

21:44.639 --> 21:45.573
Veronica.

21:45.606 --> 21:46.607
Father Romero.

21:47.675 --> 21:49.309
Could I have another peek?

21:49.342 --> 21:50.343
Of course.

22:01.689 --> 22:02.757
Thang?

22:02.790 --> 22:04.391
Thang, come here.

22:04.425 --> 22:05.660
What, what?

22:05.693 --> 22:07.360
Take a look at this.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.261
Look.

22:08.295 --> 22:09.296
- Oh! - Look.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.535
Holy shit.

22:19.574 --> 22:20.675
Medical marijuana?

22:21.676 --> 22:22.944
No.

22:22.977 --> 22:26.614
Hey, sure smells like hippy lettuce to me.

22:26.647 --> 22:27.749
Hippy lettuce?

22:27.782 --> 22:31.819
You know, ganja, happy tobacky, Mary jane, boo ya.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.588
- Boo ya. - Boo ya, boo ya.

22:34.455 --> 22:37.290
It cannabis sativa tea.

22:37.324 --> 22:38.593
I grow it myself.

22:38.626 --> 22:39.527
You try some?

22:39.560 --> 22:40.795
No, no no.

22:40.828 --> 22:42.597
I'll stick with this warm beer for now.

22:56.410 --> 22:58.579
I'm gonna go to the shitter.

22:58.613 --> 22:59.914
Go, in peace.

22:59.947 --> 23:01.983
Oh yeah, I'm gonna peace me a river.

23:06.087 --> 23:06.954
Hey hey hey.

23:09.056 --> 23:11.425
I'm deaf, I'm deaf!

23:11.459 --> 23:12.727
Oh, all right.

23:31.979 --> 23:34.048
I'm taking dinner order.

23:34.081 --> 23:34.916
Chicken or beef?

23:34.949 --> 23:36.083
Chicken please.

23:37.485 --> 23:38.653
Chicken or beef?

23:38.686 --> 23:40.688
Oh my goodness, you're having the chicken?

23:40.721 --> 23:42.757
I'll have the chicken, that sounds delicious.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.391
Thank you, so easy.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.395
Excuse me sir, I'm taking dinner order.

23:48.429 --> 23:49.897
Chicken or beef?

23:50.965 --> 23:53.701
Ah, just sleeping, so sweet.

23:53.734 --> 23:55.803
Your grandmother told me you want beef.

23:58.606 --> 23:59.507
Hello ma'am.

23:59.540 --> 24:00.373
Hi.

24:00.408 --> 24:01.108
Chicken or beef?

24:01.142 --> 24:02.610
Chicken or beef?

24:02.643 --> 24:04.779
Yeah, did I stutter?

24:04.812 --> 24:06.414
I am vegan.

24:06.447 --> 24:10.051
I don't recall anybody reserved the vegan order

24:10.084 --> 24:11.018
for this seat.

24:11.052 --> 24:12.553
Yeah, and that's because

24:12.587 --> 24:14.922
this was a last-minute seat.

24:15.857 --> 24:18.593
Okay, I make sure myself.

24:18.626 --> 24:20.995
I'll find one, just for you.

24:21.028 --> 24:22.563
Thank you.

24:30.204 --> 24:33.641
That fucking bitch, drive me absolutely nuts.

24:33.674 --> 24:35.643
Do you have anything, that's not breathing?

24:35.676 --> 24:36.777
Yeah, you.

24:41.449 --> 24:42.750
- Fuck you. - Fuck you!

24:42.783 --> 24:43.618
Go find something.

24:43.651 --> 24:44.518
Okay, I look.

24:45.820 --> 24:48.522
Oh she drives me crazy.

24:48.556 --> 24:51.125
Ah, we had something greenish,

24:51.158 --> 24:52.860
but I don't think it meat.

24:52.894 --> 24:53.728
I can't read the date.

24:53.761 --> 24:57.164
Go ahead, make it hot, make it hot hot.

25:08.542 --> 25:12.613
motherfucker.

25:13.781 --> 25:14.649
Die!

25:21.622 --> 25:22.690
Motherfucker.

25:23.557 --> 25:25.626
Don't even come near me.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.695
Your mother sucks cock.

25:30.598 --> 25:31.666
This your little boy?

25:31.699 --> 25:34.035
I'm sorry, my son doesn't mean what he's saying.

25:34.068 --> 25:37.438
Bloody mother

25:42.743 --> 25:44.111
How long has he been talking in tongues?

25:44.145 --> 25:46.113
Dukie can't control himself.

25:46.147 --> 25:47.648
He has Tourette Syndrome.

25:47.682 --> 25:48.816
Jackass.

25:48.849 --> 25:50.217
Eat my ass.

25:50.251 --> 25:51.652
Oh, Tourette's, my God.

25:52.887 --> 25:53.821
My bad.

25:53.854 --> 25:55.723
For a minute I thought he was possessed.

25:55.756 --> 25:57.525
So did I, it happens.

25:59.994 --> 26:01.162
Whore!

26:01.195 --> 26:02.797
Some fuckin' twat!

26:03.998 --> 26:04.832
Cunt.

26:04.865 --> 26:05.533
What happened?

26:05.566 --> 26:06.367
Everything okay?

26:06.401 --> 26:08.602
Yes, thank you for your concern.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.037
May I have a towel.

26:10.071 --> 26:11.205
I think I'm gonna breastfeed him.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.540
It will calm him down.

26:15.176 --> 26:16.077
Amanda?

26:16.110 --> 26:19.113
We need towel for baby lady.

26:19.146 --> 26:20.114
Thank you.

26:26.087 --> 26:27.154
- Hey there. - Hi.

26:27.188 --> 26:28.022
What you need towel for?

26:28.055 --> 26:30.558
A towel, I'm gonna breastfeed him.

26:30.591 --> 26:32.560
So he'll stop screaming.

26:32.593 --> 26:33.995
Will that be okay?

26:34.028 --> 26:34.729
It's okay.

26:34.762 --> 26:35.563
I can help you.

26:35.596 --> 26:37.798
Okay, I was gonna have a towel,

26:37.832 --> 26:39.633
just so that, you don't care?

26:39.667 --> 26:40.668
I don't care.

26:40.701 --> 26:42.570
Will you block me, then?

26:42.603 --> 26:43.571
Yeah, sure.

26:43.604 --> 26:45.639
And I really don't care.

26:45.673 --> 26:47.742
Come on baby, I know you must be hungry.

26:47.775 --> 26:49.777
It's been a long time since we've eaten.

27:00.621 --> 27:02.690
Oh my God, anybody smoke in here.

27:02.723 --> 27:04.592
No, no, it's occupied.

27:06.794 --> 27:10.998
Hey, who's smokin', I'm not smokin'.

27:11.032 --> 27:15.302
I'm not smokin'.

27:15.336 --> 27:16.804
Holy shit!

27:20.074 --> 27:21.308
Take it easy!

27:21.342 --> 27:24.645
Take it easy!

27:27.048 --> 27:28.215
Christ, what now?

27:29.884 --> 27:32.620
I don't want to die.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.233
You look like I bake a cake,

27:46.267 --> 27:47.268
but I didn't eat it.

27:48.669 --> 27:49.870
What is this?

28:17.164 --> 28:18.732
What take so long?

28:21.335 --> 28:22.670
Something wrong with me?

28:23.671 --> 28:24.305
No.

28:24.338 --> 28:25.673
Do I still look pretty?

28:26.740 --> 28:27.842
Yes.

28:27.875 --> 28:28.809
Yeah, you look good.

28:28.843 --> 28:30.077
Kinda ashy, but.

28:30.111 --> 28:32.746
Okay, give me hug.

28:32.780 --> 28:33.647
Okay.

28:35.049 --> 28:36.650
Okay, that enough, that's okay.

28:37.685 --> 28:38.352
Okay.

28:40.455 --> 28:41.689
You gonna use it?

28:43.458 --> 28:44.925
God.

28:44.959 --> 28:46.127
What a nightmare.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.695
Yeah, what a nightmare.

28:49.363 --> 28:50.931
Quick quick, cook cook.

28:50.965 --> 28:51.832
Okay.

28:53.868 --> 28:54.735
Not done yet.

28:56.804 --> 28:58.339
Oh wait, it's done.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.346
I don't think you want to check that.

29:05.379 --> 29:06.414
Shhh.

29:14.388 --> 29:16.724
Viet Kong Airways, fat-free, sugar-free,

29:16.757 --> 29:18.759
bleeding-free, gluten-free, everything-free,

29:18.792 --> 29:20.794
pea pea souffle.

29:20.828 --> 29:23.364
The finest, just for the eyeball lady.

29:23.397 --> 29:24.832
Ha ha.

29:24.865 --> 29:26.367
Finally, man.

29:26.401 --> 29:28.869
I'm starving, I could eat a horse.

29:29.737 --> 29:30.938
A vegan horse that is.

29:32.973 --> 29:33.807
Thank you.

29:33.841 --> 29:35.042
We serve the peas.

29:35.075 --> 29:37.378
Airplane always enjoy it.

29:37.412 --> 29:38.312
Let me check you.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.982
Oh, big eyeball.

29:43.350 --> 29:45.052
I love white men.

30:10.077 --> 30:12.179
What are you eating?

30:12.213 --> 30:14.315
Oh this is a kosher meal.

30:14.348 --> 30:16.283
Looks like a chicken breast to me.

30:17.218 --> 30:19.086
Well, yes it is.

30:20.888 --> 30:22.289
Any meat can be kosher.

30:22.323 --> 30:24.892
It just means that according to the Torah,

30:24.925 --> 30:28.996
the animal was slaughtered in a way that was not painful,

30:29.029 --> 30:33.000
during, before death, or during death, at any time.

30:33.033 --> 30:34.768
There's a lot of fuckin' rules of course,

30:34.802 --> 30:36.837
but it's kosher.

30:38.573 --> 30:43.744
Is ball-handling okay?

31:02.229 --> 31:03.264
Is that kosher?

31:37.164 --> 31:38.999
Sorry to wake you folks, this is your captain.

31:39.033 --> 31:41.335
It's looks like we've had a little turbulence.

31:41.368 --> 31:44.271
Please keep your seatbelts fastened.

31:44.305 --> 31:45.507
What?

31:45.540 --> 31:47.174
I don't know, I was sleeping.

31:55.349 --> 31:56.618
Oh, the bungee drop?

31:56.651 --> 31:57.519
No!

32:04.559 --> 32:06.060
Oh my God.

32:06.093 --> 32:11.098
I'm excited too.

32:15.202 --> 32:17.405
Hail Mary, full of grace.

32:30.685 --> 32:32.886
Do you ever wonder why you're still a copilot?

32:32.920 --> 32:34.556
- Don't go there. - Sorry folks,

32:34.589 --> 32:35.956
that was a little bouncy.

32:37.057 --> 32:39.259
It might freak a few of you out but,

32:40.160 --> 32:41.663
we're in one piece.

32:41.696 --> 32:44.632
And we're continuing on to Vietnam,

32:45.667 --> 32:47.234
through the Bikini Triangle.

32:47.267 --> 32:48.636
Bikini!

32:48.670 --> 32:49.604
Triangle!

33:13.428 --> 33:14.596
Where are you from?

33:14.629 --> 33:16.997
Don't tell me, The Vatican?

33:18.132 --> 33:19.434
You okay, honey?

33:27.074 --> 33:29.143
Maybe if you're lucky,

33:29.176 --> 33:31.513
you can catch the lightning from your window.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.094
Mom!

34:21.128 --> 34:21.962
What?

34:22.797 --> 34:25.264
Stop being silly, let mama sleep.

34:26.634 --> 34:31.639
There's something on the wing of the plane.

34:36.610 --> 34:37.779
What now Dukie?

34:37.812 --> 34:39.346
He's out there.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.083
Stop this now, Dukie.

34:44.117 --> 34:45.487
It's not funny.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.554
Act your age.

35:19.386 --> 35:20.254
No.

35:28.630 --> 35:33.635
I want into the depths of hell.

35:34.736 --> 35:37.805
- Die mommy, die! - Dukie, keep still.

35:37.839 --> 35:39.373
Die mommy, die!

35:53.220 --> 35:55.757
How do you like me now, bitches?

35:57.559 --> 35:59.661
That's not the rips.

36:16.209 --> 36:17.377
Lucifer.

36:20.882 --> 36:25.486
I command you, release this soul.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.621
The Father commands you.

36:26.654 --> 36:29.156
Christ the Son commands you.

36:29.189 --> 36:31.224
Father himself commands you.

36:31.258 --> 36:32.092
Be gone,

36:33.193 --> 36:34.829
into the fires of hell,

36:34.862 --> 36:35.830
for all eternity.

36:36.764 --> 36:38.165
Baby, baby.

36:38.198 --> 36:39.434
What happened to you?

36:42.704 --> 36:45.238
What did you do to him?

36:45.272 --> 36:47.341
He's just a little boy.

36:47.374 --> 36:50.143
He was possessed by the entity of the dark world.

36:50.177 --> 36:51.378
An entity?

36:51.412 --> 36:53.748
Yes, but I exorcized it.

36:53.781 --> 36:55.349
Your boy is safe now.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.821
Hey everyone, go back to your seats.

36:59.854 --> 37:01.388
It was a medical thing.

37:01.422 --> 37:02.090
It's okay.

37:02.122 --> 37:03.323
You all go back to your seats.

37:03.357 --> 37:05.493
He's fine, he was possessed.

37:05.526 --> 37:06.360
You are.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.327
He's fine now.

37:07.361 --> 37:08.228
Possessed?

37:09.464 --> 37:10.397
My baby.

37:10.431 --> 37:12.299
You need to breast feeding him.

37:12.332 --> 37:13.367
Yes.

37:13.401 --> 37:14.802
This ain't over.

37:14.836 --> 37:16.203
Because you're a baby honey.

37:16.236 --> 37:18.640
Americans, trouble.

37:18.673 --> 37:20.408
Because they won't calm down.

37:29.282 --> 37:30.317
Oh my God!

37:30.350 --> 37:32.420
John Wayne, I'm John Wayne.

37:32.453 --> 37:33.286
You have to leave.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.422
Go go go go go.

37:43.998 --> 37:45.700
Father, are you waiting for me?

37:45.733 --> 37:48.703
You go sit in your seat, and stay there, go!

37:48.736 --> 37:50.738
How do I get into the plane's storage compartment?

37:51.739 --> 37:52.907
Storage compartment?

37:52.940 --> 37:54.374
You're out of your fucking mind.

37:54.409 --> 37:56.644
Everybody on board is in grave danger.

37:56.678 --> 37:58.479
Americans, always trouble.

37:58.513 --> 37:59.981
Big troublemakers.

38:00.014 --> 38:02.450
Like America, grab 'em by the pussy.

38:02.483 --> 38:04.251
No pussy, I'm not grabbin' anybody's pussy.

38:04.284 --> 38:04.852
Big trouble now.

38:04.886 --> 38:05.687
You sit in your seat.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.689
May God have mercy on your soul.

38:10.425 --> 38:12.292
You're a very bad girl.

38:12.325 --> 38:13.594
Just for you.

38:13.628 --> 38:14.829
I'm a bad girl.

38:16.030 --> 38:17.330
You sit there, no move.

38:20.735 --> 38:21.602
Thank you.

38:24.371 --> 38:25.338
She's so feisty.

38:28.543 --> 38:29.410
You want some prune juice,

38:29.444 --> 38:31.813
I can find out if they have prune juice.

38:31.846 --> 38:32.814
Will you shut up!

38:37.418 --> 38:38.285
I'm sorry.

38:39.487 --> 38:41.189
I thought this was the armrest.

38:42.389 --> 38:44.992
You don't have to apologize, you can,

38:46.027 --> 38:47.795
press it there as long as you want.

38:51.599 --> 38:52.467
So,

38:54.367 --> 38:56.571
are you a member of the club?

38:56.604 --> 38:57.605
What club?

38:58.473 --> 39:00.340
You know, that club.

39:01.609 --> 39:02.844
That club?

39:02.877 --> 39:03.745
No.

39:08.683 --> 39:11.919
Are you nervous about your secretary?

39:15.322 --> 39:16.557
What do you care about that?

39:19.794 --> 39:20.661
Follow me.

39:21.829 --> 39:23.330
Knock three times.

39:24.565 --> 39:25.433
Okay.

39:59.534 --> 40:00.902
Oh hey.

40:00.935 --> 40:02.570
Brad.

40:02.603 --> 40:04.105
Hi honey.

40:04.138 --> 40:06.674
I miss you baby, come here.

40:06.707 --> 40:08.009
I need a kiss from you.

40:11.712 --> 40:12.647
I just had peanuts,

40:12.680 --> 40:17.785
and so I smell like perfume, peanuts, mm-mm.

40:18.519 --> 40:19.620
Okay, well fine.

40:19.654 --> 40:20.922
I tried anyway.

40:20.955 --> 40:22.790
You know what sweetie, just lie back,

40:22.824 --> 40:24.091
you've got those eye covers,

40:24.125 --> 40:25.693
and put the earphones in.

40:25.726 --> 40:26.627
Just relax, okay?

40:26.661 --> 40:27.962
We'll be there in no time.

40:27.995 --> 40:29.030
Nighty-night.

40:31.732 --> 40:32.900
Goodnight, sweetheart.

40:39.674 --> 40:40.508
Club done?

40:40.541 --> 40:41.676
Is there a way to club?

40:56.657 --> 40:58.391
You're so hot.

40:59.126 --> 41:01.062
Oh wow, right away, huh?

41:01.095 --> 41:02.029
Gettin' right to it.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.767
Oh my God,

41:06.801 --> 41:08.836
it fits right in there, huh?

41:08.870 --> 41:09.737
Oh my God.

41:20.448 --> 41:21.115
Oh my God.

41:30.992 --> 41:32.493
Oh my God.

41:32.526 --> 41:37.531
Oh, oh.

41:50.578 --> 41:52.079
Oh my God, that burns.

41:52.113 --> 41:53.114
Please stop.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.190
I hope you enjoyed this hot piece of ass.

42:08.229 --> 42:09.163
Oh mommy.

42:18.906 --> 42:20.942
I shouldn't have cheated.

42:27.548 --> 42:29.150
I'm dying, I'm dying.

42:44.598 --> 42:45.666
Oh shit.

42:45.700 --> 42:46.634
Oh shit.

42:46.667 --> 42:48.235
Oh shit.

42:48.269 --> 42:49.804
What you do?

42:49.837 --> 42:50.671
It was an accident.

42:50.705 --> 42:52.173
She fell and hit her head.

42:52.206 --> 42:53.207
I smell smoke.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.075
Somebody smoking.

42:54.108 --> 42:56.077
No, she was possessed.

42:56.110 --> 42:57.244
They were possessed.

42:57.278 --> 42:59.780
There's something evil on this plane.

42:59.814 --> 43:01.015
Quit that.

43:01.048 --> 43:01.882
But just not that tight.

43:01.916 --> 43:04.719
Listen to me, we're all gonna die

43:04.752 --> 43:06.187
if I don't get into the luggage department.

43:06.220 --> 43:08.222
Father, why you Americans always yell at me.

43:08.255 --> 43:09.957
Everybody yell at me.

43:09.991 --> 43:11.859
Please Amanda, I need your help.

43:13.728 --> 43:15.930
Father, nobody say please to me.

43:15.963 --> 43:17.231
Please say it again.

43:18.332 --> 43:19.200
Please.

43:22.103 --> 43:24.005
Oh I like therapy.

43:24.038 --> 43:25.906
Get a room!

43:25.940 --> 43:28.075
You expect me to figure this out.

43:28.109 --> 43:29.577
Thang, listen,

43:29.610 --> 43:32.246
when we get the body away, you clean all the mess.

43:32.279 --> 43:33.647
Okay?

43:33.681 --> 43:34.582
Come on.

43:36.784 --> 43:37.651
Sorry.

43:43.290 --> 43:45.092
There nothing left.

43:49.030 --> 43:50.998
Baby baby, relax.

43:51.032 --> 43:52.099
Take you to heaven.

43:52.133 --> 43:54.335
Let's keep this hush-hush.

43:54.368 --> 43:56.604
We mustn't start a panic with the other passengers.

43:56.637 --> 43:57.838
Okay, Father.

44:16.791 --> 44:17.625
Gentle, gentle.

44:18.926 --> 44:20.661
Isn't there somewhere else we can put the body?

44:20.694 --> 44:22.096
Like a storage compartment?

44:22.129 --> 44:24.632
Father, she paid for the seat,

44:24.665 --> 44:25.699
and she staying there.

44:25.733 --> 44:26.801
There are rules.

44:26.834 --> 44:30.037
But that's when she was alive, now she's a corpse.

44:30.071 --> 44:31.806
Father, there's no more space left.

44:31.839 --> 44:32.706
She paid for the seat.

44:32.740 --> 44:35.276
I mean, listen to me okay, you shut up.

44:37.678 --> 44:40.648
I need help, I can't clean it up by myself.

44:40.681 --> 44:41.315
Oh my God!

44:41.348 --> 44:43.084
What is this, go go!

44:45.420 --> 44:47.922
Father, we clean it.

44:47.955 --> 44:48.789
clean it.

44:48.823 --> 44:50.357
You gonna get punished.

45:37.304 --> 45:41.108
Boy those steroids really put you to sleep.

45:42.977 --> 45:44.979
What the hell are you doing?

45:45.012 --> 45:46.247
I'm going to the bathroom.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.749
Damn, can't a man get some sleep around here?

45:50.418 --> 45:51.285
Come on man.

46:08.169 --> 46:10.438
What the hell happened to her?

46:10.472 --> 46:11.305
Shh.

46:11.338 --> 46:12.139
What?

46:12.173 --> 46:14.041
Shh, it's complicated.

46:14.074 --> 46:14.909
What?

46:14.942 --> 46:17.479
It's complicated.

46:17.512 --> 46:19.180
What?

46:19.213 --> 46:21.315
Come sit down, sit down.

46:31.058 --> 46:32.993
I'm Rabbi Feldman, by the way.

46:34.361 --> 46:36.297
How can I help you, Father?

46:36.330 --> 46:38.265
Have you ever witnessed an exorcism?

46:39.867 --> 46:43.103
Not really my field of expertise.

46:43.137 --> 46:46.040
Mostly brises and bar mitzvahs.

46:46.073 --> 46:47.107
But they can be hell.

46:48.242 --> 46:51.446
Unfortunately, Jews don't go in much for exorcisms,

46:51.479 --> 46:54.449
but I'll do what I can to help, Father.

46:54.482 --> 46:57.017
Satan is very powerful, and cunning.

46:58.420 --> 46:59.487
We'll need to work together.

46:59.521 --> 47:01.523
The entity will show itself again.

47:01.556 --> 47:03.324
But where, we don't know.

47:04.892 --> 47:07.995
Well how can you be certain it will strike again?

47:08.028 --> 47:10.432
Because I brought Garvan's body on board

47:10.465 --> 47:12.199
when I checked in.

47:12.233 --> 47:13.234
Who is Garvan?

47:18.440 --> 47:20.774
I served as an Army Chaplain in Nam.

47:21.942 --> 47:23.344
This young mother

47:25.513 --> 47:27.248
who saw that I was a priest and,

47:29.049 --> 47:30.351
begged for my help.

47:30.384 --> 47:33.555
Her daughter was screaming, and going crazy.

47:33.588 --> 47:35.155
Our platoon leader, Lieutenant Garvan and I,

47:35.189 --> 47:36.257
entered the hut.

47:36.290 --> 47:38.959
On the floor were two dead US Marines

47:38.993 --> 47:42.096
with their heads twisted on backwards.

47:43.531 --> 47:46.300
And that's when Garvan snapped.

47:46.333 --> 47:48.369
The mother threw herself

47:48.403 --> 47:50.304
over the little girl to protect her.

47:50.337 --> 47:53.274
That's when Garvan stabbed her in the back

47:53.307 --> 47:54.542
with his bayonet.

47:54.576 --> 47:56.377
Garvan was distracted by the girl,

47:56.411 --> 47:58.312
as her possession rose,

47:58.345 --> 48:00.515
her eyes rolled back in her head.

48:02.082 --> 48:03.884
He shot her, in the heart.

48:12.427 --> 48:13.360
What a terrible story.

48:14.862 --> 48:17.231
What happened to the entity, and the little girl?

48:18.365 --> 48:20.402
I don't remember much more after that.

48:20.435 --> 48:23.471
I ran, bombs were going off.

48:23.505 --> 48:24.805
Bullets over my head.

48:25.973 --> 48:29.343
Bodies exploding, and then I saw Garvan,

48:32.913 --> 48:35.149
standing over me, with his gun.

48:37.318 --> 48:39.119
And he shot me, in the head.

48:40.455 --> 48:41.355
Right there.

48:42.490 --> 48:43.491
No, there.

48:46.360 --> 48:47.895
Yes yes.

48:47.928 --> 48:50.030
Looks like a bird made a poo-poo.

48:52.099 --> 48:54.536
I was barely alive when they medevaced me back

48:54.569 --> 48:56.170
to the base hospital,

48:56.203 --> 48:59.273
when I fell into a coma for five years.

48:59.306 --> 49:02.477
You were in a coma for five years?

49:02.510 --> 49:04.412
And then a miracle happened.

49:04.446 --> 49:07.582
I woke up with a metal plate in my head,

49:09.316 --> 49:11.553
with amnesia and PTSD.

49:13.455 --> 49:15.389
It took me a year and half

49:15.423 --> 49:18.158
to learn how to walk and talk again, without drooling.

49:19.661 --> 49:21.563
I never told anyone that story before.

49:22.697 --> 49:23.565
Well,

49:25.065 --> 49:27.402
you are a very lucky man.

49:27.435 --> 49:30.304
Yeah, but I don't think so good anymore.

49:30.337 --> 49:32.039
I have these terrible headaches.

49:33.441 --> 49:34.975
Keeps me awake at night.

49:36.944 --> 49:38.979
Things get so twisted around in my brain,

49:41.649 --> 49:43.651
I forget what I'm doing half the time.

49:43.685 --> 49:46.554
They give me pills to help me sleep,

49:46.588 --> 49:49.923
for anxiety, for the pain.

49:52.192 --> 49:54.294
It doesn't work because I forget to take them,

49:54.328 --> 49:57.331
and when I take them, it makes me aggressive,

49:57.364 --> 49:59.434
and horny, and suicidal.

50:04.204 --> 50:05.673
So why are you going to Vietnam?

50:06.674 --> 50:07.975
Timeshare.

50:08.008 --> 50:10.244
Oh.

50:22.356 --> 50:25.359
How did you like your pea souffle?

50:26.728 --> 50:28.530
Oh, I don't feel so good.

50:28.563 --> 50:30.998
I think I'm gonna throw up.

50:31.031 --> 50:32.434
In the barf bag.

50:33.300 --> 50:34.669
I don't have one.

50:34.702 --> 50:36.270
Oh God!

50:36.303 --> 50:38.071
We need barf bag fast!

50:38.105 --> 50:39.507
This is an emergency.

50:39.541 --> 50:41.709
Sorry to wake you up, but we need a barf bag.

50:41.743 --> 50:42.677
Anybody got one?

50:42.710 --> 50:43.545
Honey move.

50:43.578 --> 50:45.112
The seat in front of you.

50:45.145 --> 50:47.381
We need emergency, hurry, wake up.

50:47.415 --> 50:48.450
Anybody got it?

50:48.483 --> 50:49.316
Got it?

50:49.349 --> 50:50.217
Pass it by.

50:50.250 --> 50:52.052
Come on, quick, fast.

50:57.324 --> 51:00.260
Everybody, anybody find one?

51:00.294 --> 51:01.696
No no, hold it in.

51:04.532 --> 51:06.200
We found one.

51:06.233 --> 51:07.267
Got it.

51:14.141 --> 51:15.610
Holy shit!

51:30.057 --> 51:31.091
I feel so much better.

51:38.398 --> 51:41.268
Cute, you should keep that look.

51:49.477 --> 51:50.512
I'll have the beef.

51:51.779 --> 51:53.380
Okay.

51:53.414 --> 51:54.816
Okay.

51:54.849 --> 51:56.049
Get back to sleep.

52:16.838 --> 52:18.138
I knew that woman was trouble

52:18.171 --> 52:20.274
as soon as I saw her armpit hair.

52:22.844 --> 52:23.678
Oh!

52:23.711 --> 52:25.345
Stop, stop, oh wait.

52:25.379 --> 52:26.748
Wait, here.

52:26.781 --> 52:28.148
You need one of these.

52:28.181 --> 52:30.418
Missus Montegue's moist towelettes.

52:30.451 --> 52:31.753
That's my family.

52:31.786 --> 52:32.654
Okay.

52:35.890 --> 52:37.124
Puppy!

52:37.157 --> 52:39.293
Oh my God, it's a miracle.

52:40.695 --> 52:42.362
Pookie, come on Pookie.

52:42.396 --> 52:44.331
Come back, you little shit.

52:44.364 --> 52:48.503
God damn it, I knew I should have.

52:48.536 --> 52:51.806
Come on, come on, come on, bad dog.

52:51.839 --> 52:52.707
Come on.

52:54.742 --> 52:55.810
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

52:55.843 --> 52:57.210
Pookie, stop it.

52:57.244 --> 52:58.546
Stop it, stop.

52:58.580 --> 52:59.447
Whoa.

53:03.718 --> 53:04.652
Pookie, come here.

53:06.487 --> 53:08.221
God damn it, Pookie.

53:10.324 --> 53:11.191
Come on.

53:11.224 --> 53:12.092
Pookie?

53:15.496 --> 53:16.363
Pookie!

53:20.233 --> 53:23.370
Get this fuckin' thing off me.

53:26.608 --> 53:28.342
Oh, Lord forgive me.

53:28.375 --> 53:29.209
Oh Pookie!

53:38.251 --> 53:42.457
I am never buying another, whatever you are, again.

53:45.225 --> 53:45.893
Pookie?

53:47.428 --> 53:48.328
Pookie?

54:01.843 --> 54:03.176
Lady, bitch.

54:12.520 --> 54:14.722
We got a mongrel running around here.

54:16.891 --> 54:17.592
Wake up lady,

54:17.625 --> 54:19.794
this is nice glass champagne.

54:22.830 --> 54:24.331
Oh, Thang, come back here.

54:46.020 --> 54:46.954
Is it real?

54:48.556 --> 54:49.957
Oh God, it's real.

55:01.268 --> 55:04.204
I think I'm gonna have this baby.

55:07.642 --> 55:11.412
Can you wait a couple of hours to start?

55:18.953 --> 55:20.488
Son of a bitch!

55:28.295 --> 55:30.465
She's having a devil baby!

55:30.498 --> 55:32.033
She's having Garvan's baby.

55:32.066 --> 55:32.734
Who?

55:32.767 --> 55:35.302
She's having Garvan's baby.

55:35.335 --> 55:36.504
Oh, Garvan's baby.

55:36.537 --> 55:37.304
What?

55:37.337 --> 55:39.339
The body of Christ compels you.

55:39.372 --> 55:41.843
The body of Christ compels you.

55:43.678 --> 55:45.513
The body of Christ compels you.

55:46.714 --> 55:47.849
It's coming out!

55:55.957 --> 55:56.858
Hurry, get him into the bathroom.

55:56.891 --> 55:57.759
Go, go.

56:00.495 --> 56:01.763
Come on, come on, come on.

56:04.432 --> 56:05.833
Come on, let's go!

56:50.912 --> 56:51.779
What?

56:52.947 --> 56:54.415
What's going on?

57:05.092 --> 57:06.427
That little bitch bit my ear!

57:13.734 --> 57:16.537
Put him up here, right in here.

57:23.144 --> 57:25.947
This flight's gonna kill me.

57:25.980 --> 57:27.782
Does anyone have a plunger?

57:27.815 --> 57:28.749
How about some Draino?

57:28.783 --> 57:31.118
Oy, he's still in there.

57:31.152 --> 57:32.753
I flushed it, I flushed it.

57:32.787 --> 57:33.855
Look, it's gone.

57:42.463 --> 57:42.930
Boy,

57:44.465 --> 57:47.902
that smelled like my Uncle Morey after Satyr dinner.

57:49.103 --> 57:50.671
Three gefilte fish.

57:52.073 --> 57:53.474
Woo.

57:55.576 --> 57:56.777
Wow.

57:56.811 --> 57:58.145
Do you think it's over, Father?

57:59.580 --> 58:01.782
Not until we destroy the entity down below.

58:04.185 --> 58:05.953
Father, I'm sorry to disturb you.

58:05.987 --> 58:07.722
It's all right, it's all right.

58:07.755 --> 58:11.025
I'm just trying to save everyone from hell and damnation.

58:12.627 --> 58:14.428
I'm scared.

58:14.462 --> 58:15.263
I don't want to die.

58:16.697 --> 58:18.432
I don't want to be possessed either.

58:18.466 --> 58:20.201
Looks gross, you know?

58:20.234 --> 58:22.136
Who's gonna pay to see that?

58:22.169 --> 58:23.037
But I believe now,

58:23.070 --> 58:25.072
or at the very least I believe in Satan,

58:25.106 --> 58:27.475
and I want to believe in God.

58:28.743 --> 58:31.545
Please, could you help me pray?

58:31.579 --> 58:32.546
Well, what you've said

58:32.580 --> 58:34.482
is already a prayer to God.

58:35.583 --> 58:36.450
Okay.

58:37.919 --> 58:39.220
I want to confess my sins, Father,

58:39.253 --> 58:40.154
and I've got a lot.

58:41.022 --> 58:41.956
- When I was 13 my, - Veronica please,

58:41.989 --> 58:43.991
- Veronica, I don't have time. - When I was 13,

58:44.025 --> 58:45.559
my step-daddy took my cherry.

58:45.593 --> 58:47.161
But you know what, I kind of led him on.

58:47.194 --> 58:48.930
And then in high school there was the football team,

58:48.963 --> 58:51.766
the B squad, you know the A squad, they're all jerks.

58:52.733 --> 58:53.968
I stole money from the coffers,

58:54.001 --> 58:55.469
but not for anything like insidious,

58:55.503 --> 58:57.138
just a little bit of ecstasy that Freddy Baker,

58:57.171 --> 58:59.473
that his brother brought back from Florida.

58:59.507 --> 59:00.942
Then there was Father Flanagan,

59:00.975 --> 59:04.211
and I didn't leave that one on, a lot.

59:04.245 --> 59:05.880
And then there was Sister Constance, you know,

59:05.913 --> 59:06.714
'cause I'm open-minded,

59:06.747 --> 59:08.916
and then, oh Father, 20 minutes ago

59:08.950 --> 59:10.851
I gave the big muscly guy a blow job.

59:10.885 --> 59:13.054
I think he ejaculated protein shake mix in my hair.

59:13.087 --> 59:15.556
It was like strawberry, which I've had worse.

59:16.691 --> 59:19.093
Father, please tell me, do you think,

59:19.126 --> 59:21.662
do you think that Jesus Christ

59:21.696 --> 59:23.597
could forgive a beautiful blonde terpsacorian

59:23.631 --> 59:26.033
from Sandusky, Ohio on her way to Pokemon, Vietnam

59:26.067 --> 59:29.136
to get vaginal rejuvenation, or is that just ridiculous?

59:29.170 --> 59:30.871
I think you need to stay off your knees, Veronica.

59:30.905 --> 59:32.606
I really have to pee.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.142
Yes, all right.

59:35.176 --> 59:36.944
Father, Father, I want to confess,

59:36.978 --> 59:38.245
I want to confess, Father.

59:40.047 --> 59:41.082
No please.

59:41.115 --> 59:44.251
I can't take, I can't take any more confessions.

59:44.285 --> 59:46.687
I just don't have the time,

59:46.721 --> 59:49.123
so please, in the name of the Father,

59:49.156 --> 59:50.992
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

59:51.025 --> 59:54.729
go back to your seats and say 50 Hail Mary's, backwards.

59:54.762 --> 59:55.596
Thank you.

59:55.629 --> 59:57.131
What an asshole!

01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:01.936
Last time, Amanda,

01:00:01.969 --> 01:00:06.874
I need to get down to the god damn luggage compartment.

01:00:06.907 --> 01:00:08.309
You're upset with luggage compartment.

01:00:08.342 --> 01:00:10.778
No, the demon is down below.

01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:12.713
The source is down below.

01:00:12.747 --> 01:00:14.315
We're all gonna die.

01:00:14.348 --> 01:00:15.216
Just say, please.

01:00:16.384 --> 01:00:19.920
Please Amanda, let me enter the luggage compartment.

01:00:19.954 --> 01:00:21.122
There, where?

01:00:21.155 --> 01:00:22.089
Go here.

01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:23.024
Open the cockpit.

01:00:23.924 --> 01:00:24.725
Open the...

01:00:24.759 --> 01:00:25.860
This is it.

01:00:28.863 --> 01:00:30.064
Go Father, here.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:43.811
Okay.

01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:49.050
I know you're down here, Garvan.

01:00:51.786 --> 01:00:54.822
Where are ya, ya son of a bitch.

01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:55.723
Come on out.

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:08.636
Oh my God!

01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:15.843
He's gone.

01:01:15.876 --> 01:01:17.144
Gone.

01:01:17.178 --> 01:01:18.012
No, Feldman.

01:01:18.045 --> 01:01:18.879
No, Garvan.

01:01:18.913 --> 01:01:19.747
No, Feldman.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:20.614
Garvan.

01:01:24.718 --> 01:01:26.353
Hey, Father Romero.

01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:27.054
How's he hangin'?

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:32.059
I'm gonna send you back to hell, you miserable bastard.

01:01:32.093 --> 01:01:33.360
Really?

01:01:33.394 --> 01:01:34.762
I belong in hell?

01:01:34.795 --> 01:01:36.664
Absolutely.

01:01:38.132 --> 01:01:39.900
You want to get so funny?

01:01:39.934 --> 01:01:42.903
When you're surrounded by 72 virgins.

01:01:42.937 --> 01:01:44.772
That's fire and brimstone.

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:45.806
Sorry.

01:01:47.341 --> 01:01:50.077
What are you gonna do Rabbi, guilt me to death?

01:01:50.111 --> 01:01:53.914
The power of modus compels you.

01:01:59.854 --> 01:02:01.188
Hey, that hurts you know.

01:02:01.222 --> 01:02:03.324
By the way, that was kind of mean of you.

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:05.427
I want to tell you one thing,

01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:09.431
I'm gonna kill everybody on this fuckin' plane.

01:02:09.464 --> 01:02:12.666
You've lost your faith, you cocksucker.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.402
God is the everlasting light.

01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:16.804
It is God who commands you.

01:02:16.837 --> 01:02:18.906
You're no match for me!

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.132
Forgive me Father,

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.101
for I have sinned.

01:02:47.134 --> 01:02:48.269
Oh fuck you.

01:03:42.923 --> 01:03:43.757
Father?

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:44.792
Father, wake up.

01:03:44.825 --> 01:03:47.061
Wake up, what I'm I gonna do?

01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:12.987
I thought you were dead.

01:04:14.489 --> 01:04:15.356
Come here.

01:04:21.529 --> 01:04:23.565
What's going on?

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:26.501
My God, you're alive!

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:30.104
We thought you were dead.

01:04:30.137 --> 01:04:33.374
I had to drag your body up from the luggage compartment,

01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:35.376
one step at a time.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:36.578
You're a lot heavier than you look.

01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:37.445
What happened?

01:04:37.479 --> 01:04:38.312
Where am I?

01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:39.813
Who are you people?

01:04:39.847 --> 01:04:42.484
Father, you're on a plane.

01:04:42.517 --> 01:04:45.553
You Americans always think you're better than yourself.

01:04:45.587 --> 01:04:47.455
I put faith in you, but you let me down.

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:51.225
How am I gonna explain to all the passengers

01:04:51.258 --> 01:04:52.494
that paid for the seat,

01:04:52.527 --> 01:04:56.230
and the chaos you created for us, huh?

01:04:56.263 --> 01:04:57.398
How?

01:04:57.432 --> 01:05:00.100
Listen, don't go all demon on us.

01:05:00.134 --> 01:05:02.504
I don't have the right to save you.

01:05:02.537 --> 01:05:03.804
Now I remember.

01:05:04.606 --> 01:05:06.940
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:05:06.974 --> 01:05:07.609
What?

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:09.176
I can't do this.

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:10.578
What happened down there to you?

01:05:10.612 --> 01:05:12.379
I'm a failure as a priest.

01:05:12.414 --> 01:05:13.814
I'm a failure as a man.

01:05:15.517 --> 01:05:17.151
I'm a lousy exorcist.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.488
I'm worthless in the eyes of God.

01:05:21.889 --> 01:05:22.923
How could it be,

01:05:22.956 --> 01:05:25.593
that while you've spent your life helping others,

01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:27.861
forgiving them of their sins,

01:05:27.895 --> 01:05:29.396
you haven't forgiven yourself.

01:05:31.633 --> 01:05:34.636
For the first time, the truth's right.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:38.272
Father, you should forgive yourself, as a old man.

01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:39.940
You're not a hero.

01:05:39.973 --> 01:05:41.975
You need a pretty lady, like me,

01:05:42.009 --> 01:05:45.312
to smooch, smash, and make sweet love.

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:50.117
Look,

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.386
I guess, I've been angry.

01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:55.457
I've been angry,

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.629
and I guess I've hated myself

01:06:01.663 --> 01:06:04.566
and God, since the Vietnam War.

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:08.636
But the only way

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:13.140
is to have the world and its errors forgiven by you,

01:06:13.173 --> 01:06:15.142
so we can all forgive together.

01:06:16.444 --> 01:06:17.945
I realize that now.

01:06:20.314 --> 01:06:21.549
You need pussy.

01:06:23.183 --> 01:06:24.486
She's right.

01:06:24.519 --> 01:06:25.386
I feel better now.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.253
Good.

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:27.489
Okay, listen.

01:06:29.223 --> 01:06:31.325
We have a lot of work to do, let's pray.

01:06:31.358 --> 01:06:32.226
Okay.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:34.128
But first,

01:06:35.195 --> 01:06:36.664
I need to piss like a racehorse.

01:07:24.044 --> 01:07:24.679
Help!

01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:26.213
Help!

01:07:29.717 --> 01:07:31.453
I command you,

01:07:31.486 --> 01:07:32.720
be gone!

01:07:32.754 --> 01:07:35.423
I'll eat your heart out, priest.

01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:38.493
Where's your holy water?

01:07:38.526 --> 01:07:39.661
I don't have it.

01:07:39.694 --> 01:07:42.229
I heard you the first time.

01:07:57.512 --> 01:07:59.379
What did you spray on him?

01:07:59.414 --> 01:08:01.416
Napalm spray, I got in Vietnam.

01:08:01.449 --> 01:08:04.017
I always keep it in my tights, just in case.

01:08:04.051 --> 01:08:05.553
To keep the bad boys away.

01:08:06.654 --> 01:08:08.523
Come with me, Amanda, come.

01:08:10.558 --> 01:08:12.059
Where in the hell's the priest goin'?

01:08:12.092 --> 01:08:13.327
It's the pills.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.530
Makes him angry, horny, and suicidal.

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.163
By the way, he's the one

01:08:17.197 --> 01:08:19.066
that brought the demon on the plane.

01:08:19.099 --> 01:08:20.535
Jesus H Christ!

01:08:20.568 --> 01:08:21.402
What?

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:22.269
What?

01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:23.136
What?

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:24.104
What?

01:08:24.136 --> 01:08:24.772
What?

01:08:24.805 --> 01:08:25.640
What?

01:08:25.673 --> 01:08:26.541
What?

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:31.779
What!

01:08:38.685 --> 01:08:39.554
Birds!

01:08:41.456 --> 01:08:43.725
Come on, man.

01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:45.660
You were in Vietnam, during the war?

01:08:46.861 --> 01:08:48.362
I grew up on the street.

01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:50.264
And the boys school.

01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:52.299
You were a boy back then?

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:53.501
Yes.

01:08:53.535 --> 01:08:54.801
Shh.

01:08:54.836 --> 01:08:56.703
I'm a girl now.

01:08:56.738 --> 01:08:58.640
Do I look pretty?

01:08:58.673 --> 01:08:59.807
Very pretty.

01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:01.442
Where did you live in Vietnam?

01:09:02.544 --> 01:09:04.712
It was called Chu Chi in Saigon.

01:09:06.145 --> 01:09:08.816
That's where my mother was killed,

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:10.618
by American soldier.

01:09:10.652 --> 01:09:11.519
Chu Chi?

01:09:13.488 --> 01:09:15.255
I can't be.

01:09:15.288 --> 01:09:16.122
Dao?

01:09:17.224 --> 01:09:19.192
How did you know my name?

01:09:19.225 --> 01:09:20.495
I was there, in the hut.

01:09:20.528 --> 01:09:21.496
You killed my mother?

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.464
No, I tried to stop him.

01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:26.501
I wanted to help your sister, she was possessed.

01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:27.801
Is American.

01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:28.803
No.

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.404
No, you're lying.

01:09:30.438 --> 01:09:31.406
I don't believe you.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:33.206
You're lying!

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.710
I remember the last words your mother spoke,

01:09:35.743 --> 01:09:36.611
before she died.

01:09:36.644 --> 01:09:40.346
She said, "Run Dao, run."

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.417
And then you ran out of the hut, escaped.

01:09:44.519 --> 01:09:46.854
I want to kill you.

01:09:46.888 --> 01:09:48.354
What can you do to change it?

01:09:48.388 --> 01:09:51.693
How can you live with that thing?

01:09:51.725 --> 01:09:53.795
You acting like American.

01:09:56.163 --> 01:09:58.633
You're the reason why I'm going back to Vietnam.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.903
To bring Garvan's body back,

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:03.605
so we can destroy it together.

01:10:05.807 --> 01:10:08.610
You brought me a corpse?

01:10:08.643 --> 01:10:10.612
That's a shitty deal.

01:10:10.645 --> 01:10:11.512
I know.

01:10:17.317 --> 01:10:19.286
Then I wasn't thinking.

01:10:19.319 --> 01:10:21.623
And now the demon is loose on this plane.

01:10:23.223 --> 01:10:25.493
Now, thanks to you we're all gonna die on this plane.

01:10:25.526 --> 01:10:26.861
Not if I can help it.

01:10:26.894 --> 01:10:28.896
I mean this may sound crazy but,

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.298
hell is at the center of the Earth, right?

01:10:31.331 --> 01:10:32.567
If there is a hell.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.701
Assuming there is,

01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:38.940
the further we fly from the hot core of the Earth,

01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:40.675
more unlikely it will be

01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:42.275
that the demon can reach us.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.482
We need to convince the captain

01:10:47.515 --> 01:10:50.618
to fly higher, into the colder temperatures,

01:10:50.652 --> 01:10:55.723
and maybe that way we can go above the demon's jurisdiction.

01:10:55.757 --> 01:10:58.760
I don't know, it sounds crazy enough to make sense.

01:10:58.793 --> 01:11:00.227
Or it will kill everyone.

01:11:01.294 --> 01:11:02.664
All our lives are in your hands.

01:11:02.697 --> 01:11:03.531
Captain?

01:11:03.564 --> 01:11:04.398
Hey!

01:11:04.432 --> 01:11:05.265
I need your help.

01:11:05.298 --> 01:11:06.233
You can't come in here.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:06.734
Now, get out.

01:11:06.768 --> 01:11:07.835
I told them.

01:11:07.869 --> 01:11:11.639
Captain, these two men told me that you can help us

01:11:11.673 --> 01:11:12.907
get rid of the demon.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.808
Demon?

01:11:14.776 --> 01:11:15.943
What demon?

01:11:15.977 --> 01:11:18.513
In the luggage compartment.

01:11:18.546 --> 01:11:19.647
There's a demon?

01:11:19.681 --> 01:11:21.248
In the luggage compartment?

01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:22.483
Would that be a metaphor?

01:11:23.785 --> 01:11:26.888
No, this is nuts.

01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:29.724
Get the fuck outta my cockpit.

01:11:29.757 --> 01:11:31.759
Hello, boys.

01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:32.860
And girl.

01:11:32.894 --> 01:11:33.895
Whatever you are.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:36.864
Jesus, what the fuck was that?

01:11:38.466 --> 01:11:40.935
The meanest passenger you've ever seen.

01:11:40.968 --> 01:11:43.471
Captain, many horrible deaths.

01:11:43.504 --> 01:11:44.906
He's telling the truth.

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:46.306
I wouldn't have believed it myself,

01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:47.542
but there's an evil entity,

01:11:47.575 --> 01:11:49.242
and it's infecting the passengers.

01:11:49.276 --> 01:11:51.612
And it's spreading like at evil fart.

01:11:51.646 --> 01:11:55.282
You farted, you fuckin' just farted, you

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:56.349
piece of shit.

01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:57.719
It stinks man.

01:11:57.752 --> 01:11:58.986
I didn't do it.

01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:04.892
Don't fart in public, go.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:06.828
Wipe your ass.

01:12:12.767 --> 01:12:14.001
What do you want me to do?

01:12:15.703 --> 01:12:17.270
Increase your altitude.

01:12:17.304 --> 01:12:18.740
What good would that do?

01:12:18.773 --> 01:12:19.907
It'll freeze him out.

01:12:20.842 --> 01:12:22.977
How high can this plane fly?

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.045
40,000 feet, max.

01:12:24.078 --> 01:12:25.312
50,000?

01:12:27.849 --> 01:12:28.916
We come apart.

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:29.817
And higher?

01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:30.685
What?

01:12:30.718 --> 01:12:31.753
And higher?

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.656
Oh, the passengers would freeze to death,

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.525
and we'd turn to ice shards.

01:12:37.558 --> 01:12:39.326
Take us to 60,000.

01:12:39.359 --> 01:12:41.796
You out of your freakin' mind?

01:12:41.829 --> 01:12:43.330
No!

01:12:43.363 --> 01:12:44.866
No, that would be suicide.

01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:45.967
How would you prefer to...

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:46.901
Suicide!

01:12:46.934 --> 01:12:48.903
How would you prefer to die?

01:12:48.936 --> 01:12:50.538
Exploding into shards of ice,

01:12:50.571 --> 01:12:53.608
or possessed and dragged through hell?

01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:54.675
For all of eternity.

01:12:58.746 --> 01:12:59.714
Give me a moment.

01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:02.416
Shards?

01:13:04.018 --> 01:13:05.653
I think I'll take the demon,

01:13:05.686 --> 01:13:07.387
being dragged through hell for all of eternity.

01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:09.056
But I will have a side of shards.

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:11.492
Captain, we must try.

01:13:11.526 --> 01:13:13.761
I have one last procedure left.

01:13:15.496 --> 01:13:16.964
I don't want to die as a man.

01:13:16.998 --> 01:13:18.566
Do you understand?

01:13:18.599 --> 01:13:20.101
Snip, snip.

01:13:20.134 --> 01:13:21.602
Snip, snip snip.

01:13:21.636 --> 01:13:22.703
Snip.

01:13:22.737 --> 01:13:23.771
Please?

01:13:23.805 --> 01:13:25.706
You know, I was savin' this

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.774
till we landed, but.

01:13:26.808 --> 01:13:28.709
Let me have a little of that.

01:13:28.743 --> 01:13:29.577
Thank you.

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:30.812
No no no.

01:13:30.845 --> 01:13:31.913
Please please?

01:13:34.448 --> 01:13:35.483
Please?

01:13:35.516 --> 01:13:39.921
Amanda, make an announcement to the passengers,

01:13:39.954 --> 01:13:42.089
that we are changing course,

01:13:42.123 --> 01:13:43.624
and we're going to the moon.

01:13:44.926 --> 01:13:45.860
Yes, Captain.

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:46.761
Thank you.

01:13:49.063 --> 01:13:50.565
We're going to the moon.

01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:53.634
Reckon she's already on the moon.

01:13:57.471 --> 01:13:58.906
Here, have a slug.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.907
Thanks.

01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:00.942
Go for it.

01:14:02.176 --> 01:14:03.578
Thank you, Father Hog.

01:14:05.079 --> 01:14:05.947
All right,

01:14:08.482 --> 01:14:09.684
we'd better hang on.

01:14:09.717 --> 01:14:11.118
Give her hell.

01:14:28.169 --> 01:14:30.037
47, pull back a little bit more, a little more.

01:14:30.938 --> 01:14:32.073
He can't fake this.

01:14:32.106 --> 01:14:34.675
Don't hit stall speed.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.043
Lower the nose just a hair.

01:14:36.944 --> 01:14:37.845
All right, there we go.

01:14:37.879 --> 01:14:39.013
Here we go.

01:14:39.046 --> 01:14:42.016
This son of a bitch should fall apart right about now.

01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:44.118
And?

01:14:45.686 --> 01:14:46.554
Fuck.

01:14:51.993 --> 01:14:54.128
Hoo, let's hang a right.

01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:59.066
Hocus pocus steady steady, steady.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.568
We're at 50,000.

01:15:14.548 --> 01:15:16.117
Don't stall it, don't stall it!

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.119
We're almost there, we're almost there.

01:15:18.152 --> 01:15:19.220
Where?

01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:20.788
Oh come on.

01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:21.923
60!

01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:24.458
Hear that?

01:15:24.492 --> 01:15:25.126
Yeah, what's that?

01:15:25.159 --> 01:15:26.027
Lower the nose.

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.795
Come on, he's still alive.

01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:28.996
No, down.

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:31.198
Oh my God, part of my knee is in my mouth.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.068
Oh man.

01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:36.904
Come on, higher man.

01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:40.174
Knock this son of a bitch out.

01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:41.909
Slow that nose speed.

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:53.154
I feel like a bobblehead.

01:15:53.187 --> 01:15:53.854
You good?

01:15:53.888 --> 01:15:55.056
Yeah, we're good.

01:15:55.089 --> 01:15:56.057
Level out, level out, level out.

01:15:59.927 --> 01:16:00.962
Oh shit.

01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:06.500
We're wrong about this plan.

01:16:08.602 --> 01:16:09.470
Shit.

01:16:14.542 --> 01:16:15.743
We made it.

01:16:15.776 --> 01:16:16.711
We made it.

01:16:23.551 --> 01:16:26.153
We need to serve some drinks and some booze.

01:16:27.154 --> 01:16:28.122
Warm up the people.

01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:40.701
May God have mercy.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.874
Amanda?

01:16:46.907 --> 01:16:48.642
Amanda come here like I told you.

01:16:49.877 --> 01:16:51.946
That's the holiest thing I've ever seen.

01:17:05.192 --> 01:17:06.227
Thang?

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.128
Huh?

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:18.606
Vagina shining with light.

01:17:20.908 --> 01:17:22.710
I want one like that.

01:17:23.944 --> 01:17:25.713
I want one like that.

01:17:53.174 --> 01:17:55.242
Flexing keep you warm.

01:17:55.276 --> 01:17:57.211
More power, more power.

01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:03.284
Almost done.

01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:16.363
I will fear no evil.

01:18:17.765 --> 01:18:20.701
Thy rod and thy staff, comforts me.

01:18:29.944 --> 01:18:31.745
Let's sit right here.

01:18:40.054 --> 01:18:42.756
Drink one of these, it's hot.

01:18:49.797 --> 01:18:50.764
Hi, pretty lady.

01:18:50.798 --> 01:18:51.966
I'm sorry so cold.

01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:53.868
You're so beautiful.

01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:54.368
I admire you.

01:18:55.836 --> 01:18:57.872
Would you like to have a drink, keep you warm?

01:18:57.905 --> 01:18:59.373
Oh no, we don't drink.

01:19:02.109 --> 01:19:03.744
Your loss, bitch.

01:19:05.413 --> 01:19:07.748
I'll pray for you.

01:19:28.403 --> 01:19:30.070
Flying at 60,000 feet didn't work,

01:19:30.104 --> 01:19:32.072
nor did holy water.

01:19:32.106 --> 01:19:33.340
I don't know what else to do.

01:19:34.775 --> 01:19:37.778
Perhaps your holy water isn't strong enough.

01:19:37.811 --> 01:19:38.413
What?

01:19:39.481 --> 01:19:42.917
I know ancient Vietnamese witch doctor potion,

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:43.717
for possession.

01:19:44.852 --> 01:19:47.188
Well why didn't you say so earlier?

01:19:47.221 --> 01:19:48.289
No one asked.

01:19:49.424 --> 01:19:50.925
You keep a secret from me?

01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:54.061
What's the ingredients to the magic potion?

01:19:54.094 --> 01:19:58.732
Okay, first is pubic hair of virgin.

01:19:58.766 --> 01:19:59.833
What?

01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:01.403
How do you expect?

01:20:02.336 --> 01:20:03.337
I got one.

01:20:23.558 --> 01:20:25.125
Forgive me Father,

01:20:25.159 --> 01:20:30.164
for I have sinned.

01:20:37.071 --> 01:20:41.208
They're possessed.

01:20:41.242 --> 01:20:42.843
They are possessed, aren't they?

01:20:42.876 --> 01:20:44.378
Of course, they're possessed.

01:20:44.412 --> 01:20:46.880
The entity is getting stronger, multiplying.

01:20:46.914 --> 01:20:49.250
Soon everyone on the plane is gonna be infected.

01:20:52.554 --> 01:20:53.887
You see that over there?

01:20:55.122 --> 01:20:56.056
The green mist.

01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:58.426
It's gotten into the ventilation system.

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.161
Okay, if it's everywhere, how do we stop it?

01:21:02.464 --> 01:21:04.031
Thang's magic potion.

01:21:04.064 --> 01:21:06.468
We put it into the air-con system,

01:21:06.501 --> 01:21:09.404
flush the entity out, and save the passengers.

01:21:09.437 --> 01:21:11.573
Okay, how do we do that?

01:21:11.606 --> 01:21:13.007
Ventilation system,

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.143
he can breathe it from the ventilation system.

01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:17.512
Ah, that's my boy.

01:21:17.545 --> 01:21:18.580
My girl!

01:21:22.049 --> 01:21:25.085
Hey, let's make the magic potion.

01:21:25.119 --> 01:21:25.953
Come on.

01:21:25.986 --> 01:21:27.087
But,

01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:30.425
not with the virgin, the hair.

01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:31.526
You got them.

01:21:35.396 --> 01:21:36.997
Jesus Christ.

01:21:37.031 --> 01:21:38.299
That's hot.

01:21:38.332 --> 01:21:39.933
Come on, let's go.

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.875
God, it's hot now.

01:21:54.882 --> 01:21:56.551
What's on the shopping list.

01:21:56.584 --> 01:21:58.085
Hair of the dog.

01:22:06.528 --> 01:22:07.394
Relax.

01:22:28.082 --> 01:22:29.083
Is enough?

01:22:30.552 --> 01:22:33.220
Next, a human bone.

01:22:33.253 --> 01:22:34.188
I got it.

01:22:43.964 --> 01:22:45.065
Sorry.

01:22:45.099 --> 01:22:47.034
People will leave hell because of you.

01:22:49.269 --> 01:22:50.904
The bone.

01:22:50.938 --> 01:22:51.606
Yeah.

01:22:52.574 --> 01:22:53.675
And, what's next?

01:22:53.708 --> 01:22:56.143
Next, eye of newt.

01:22:57.244 --> 01:23:01.982
Okay, got it.

01:23:14.995 --> 01:23:15.963
I'm terribly sorry.

01:23:18.265 --> 01:23:19.133
This one?

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:20.702
What's that for?

01:23:20.735 --> 01:23:22.302
Eye of newt.

01:23:22.336 --> 01:23:23.505
Close enough, now mix.

01:23:34.549 --> 01:23:36.350
Pour it into the air vent.

01:23:36.383 --> 01:23:37.652
There.

01:23:42.356 --> 01:23:44.091
Sorry sorry sorry.

01:23:46.226 --> 01:23:47.060
Good?

01:23:47.094 --> 01:23:48.496
Smells like ass.

01:23:53.267 --> 01:23:55.470
Now I make announcement.

01:23:55.503 --> 01:23:58.071
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,

01:23:58.105 --> 01:23:59.741
this is Amanda, don't panic.

01:24:09.584 --> 01:24:11.318
Please, don't panic.

01:24:13.588 --> 01:24:15.122
It's show time!

01:24:20.628 --> 01:24:22.564
Happy new years losers.

01:24:24.031 --> 01:24:26.366
Watch out, he's got a bomb.

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:37.512
I must warn you, Hercules,

01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:40.415
I'm a trained assassin, with the...

01:24:53.461 --> 01:24:54.762
Don't look him in the eye.

01:24:54.796 --> 01:24:56.063
What?

01:24:56.096 --> 01:24:57.364
Don't look him in the eye.

01:24:58.332 --> 01:25:01.001
It's hell, Doctor John Wayne.

01:25:11.579 --> 01:25:13.247
What's goin' on?

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.483
You are in.

01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:29.296
Feldman, god damn it!

01:25:29.329 --> 01:25:31.164
You're on my balls.

01:25:31.198 --> 01:25:32.065
What?

01:25:32.867 --> 01:25:34.402
You're on my balls.

01:25:34.435 --> 01:25:36.036
Oh I thought you said boils.

01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:40.374
God damn it Feldman, open this god damn door.

01:25:40.408 --> 01:25:41.074
What?

01:25:41.108 --> 01:25:42.744
I said open the door, Feldman.

01:25:42.777 --> 01:25:44.712
Why didn't you say so?

01:25:44.746 --> 01:25:46.113
What's wrong with you?

01:25:47.114 --> 01:25:48.248
The hearing.

01:25:51.218 --> 01:25:52.052
What happened to him?

01:25:52.085 --> 01:25:53.855
I don't know, I think it's boils.

01:25:54.756 --> 01:25:56.223
Open the door!

01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:04.097
I'm gonna make sweeping the hall.

01:26:04.131 --> 01:26:05.332
Please don't.

01:26:09.136 --> 01:26:10.505
Go go go go.

01:26:20.247 --> 01:26:25.252
Holy shit, fuck you, you big macho son of a bitch.

01:26:31.893 --> 01:26:32.727
Look!

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.761
There's an airfield.

01:26:35.262 --> 01:26:36.864
What the hell?

01:26:36.898 --> 01:26:38.833
It's the pits, it's the pits.

01:26:43.571 --> 01:26:44.839
Captain?

01:26:44.872 --> 01:26:45.773
Can you fly this plane?

01:26:45.807 --> 01:26:47.675
I can fly this plane

01:26:49.343 --> 01:26:52.212
with my head turned backwards.

01:26:56.751 --> 01:26:58.553
But who needs a head?

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.828
Captain!

01:27:08.463 --> 01:27:09.497
Who's gonna fly the plane?

01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:10.498
I will.

01:27:10.531 --> 01:27:12.634
You know how to fly a commercial airliner?

01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:15.470
Better than a headless Captain.

01:27:29.617 --> 01:27:31.819
Why is Carrie Bellson in my bathrobe?

01:27:32.954 --> 01:27:34.022
He's still alive.

01:27:34.055 --> 01:27:38.760
Good good, maybe he can help me land this thing.

01:27:38.793 --> 01:27:40.528
72 virgins.

01:27:40.561 --> 01:27:42.262
Talk to the controller.

01:27:42.295 --> 01:27:44.432
Don't let him fall asleep.

01:27:45.867 --> 01:27:47.334
Turn the steering left

01:27:47.367 --> 01:27:50.571
until you see the number on that dial hit 7-6-0.

01:27:51.973 --> 01:27:55.443
Then you flip that blue switch on the lower right there.

01:27:55.476 --> 01:27:56.978
That will lower the flaps.

01:27:57.011 --> 01:27:58.479
What do we do now?

01:27:58.513 --> 01:28:00.615
How far are we from the airport?

01:28:00.648 --> 01:28:02.583
We're 10 miles away.

01:28:02.617 --> 01:28:04.585
Lower landing gear.

01:28:04.619 --> 01:28:05.453
Landing gear.

01:28:05.486 --> 01:28:06.421
Lower the gear.

01:28:06.454 --> 01:28:07.655
Lower the gear.

01:28:23.538 --> 01:28:25.473
Going in for a landing.

01:28:31.546 --> 01:28:33.715
You're going to descend.

01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:58.371
We did it!

01:29:02.710 --> 01:29:03.644
I pooped my pants.

01:29:04.612 --> 01:29:05.847
Is that what that is?

01:29:08.883 --> 01:29:10.283
Vietnam.

01:29:10.317 --> 01:29:11.018
I'm back.

01:29:12.854 --> 01:29:14.422
It's a miracle.

01:29:14.455 --> 01:29:15.656
We landed.

01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:16.724
Oy.

01:29:16.758 --> 01:29:18.826
- We landed. - Father.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.828
Poor Buzz, he didn't make it.

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:21.696
I'm not dead though.

01:29:21.729 --> 01:29:23.296
He's the real hero.

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:24.599
Yes, why?

01:29:24.632 --> 01:29:27.034
And everyone else on this plane who died.

01:29:27.068 --> 01:29:27.769
Lot of people.

01:29:29.036 --> 01:29:31.338
Lot of people, I can't remember all their names.

01:29:31.371 --> 01:29:35.476
You know Father, for an American, you not so bad.

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:37.411
Oh, thanks Thang.

01:29:37.445 --> 01:29:38.980
You slanted-eyed devil.

01:29:39.013 --> 01:29:40.481
You're not so bad yourself.

01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:43.084
Father?

01:29:43.117 --> 01:29:43.951
Yeah.

01:29:43.985 --> 01:29:44.652
- And you? - Yeah.

01:29:44.685 --> 01:29:46.353
I don't care if you're gay,

01:29:46.386 --> 01:29:47.722
You have great heart,

01:29:47.755 --> 01:29:49.557
and thank you for saving our lives.

01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:51.926
Okay.

01:29:51.959 --> 01:29:52.493
I'm outta here.

01:29:52.527 --> 01:29:53.628
She's right.

01:29:53.661 --> 01:29:54.695
When you're right you're right.

01:29:54.729 --> 01:29:57.565
I've got another demon to exorcize.

01:29:57.598 --> 01:29:59.467
In the bathroom?

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.837
Want to play with my little friend.

01:30:10.645 --> 01:30:11.679
You little shit.

01:30:11.712 --> 01:30:14.115
I pumped out bigger turds than you.

01:30:15.783 --> 01:30:17.585
No wonder the toilet was so clogged.

01:30:17.618 --> 01:30:18.519
Wanna play catch?

01:30:37.672 --> 01:30:38.773
Smell like poop.

01:30:38.806 --> 01:30:40.708
I'm not gonna clean that up.

01:30:52.987 --> 01:30:54.822
Good morning, Vietnam.

01:30:56.023 --> 01:30:58.926
I will never fly economy again.

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.828
Talk about hell.

01:31:00.862 --> 01:31:02.395
Be gone.

01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:03.564
Ah crap.

01:31:06.968 --> 01:31:08.903
Oy, here we go again.

01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:30.558
How's this?

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:33.027
What?

01:31:35.897 --> 01:31:37.098
Isn't he fun?

01:31:38.699 --> 01:31:40.034
Hear I'm vegan.

01:31:41.736 --> 01:31:42.670
Oh mommy.

01:31:48.242 --> 01:31:49.777
Jesus H Christ!

01:32:20.508 --> 01:32:22.109
I'll have the beef.

01:34:48.355 --> 01:34:49.990
I really don't feel that bad.

01:34:52.026 --> 01:34:53.094
That's weird.

01:34:55.296 --> 01:34:56.697
Captain Houdee?

01:34:58.666 --> 01:34:59.333
Whatever.

01:35:11.679 --> 01:35:12.646
Fuck it, he's gone.

01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:17.084
Yeah, okay.

01:35:38.406 --> 01:35:39.273
Shit!
