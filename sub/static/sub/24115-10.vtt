00:03.160 --> 00:04.160
<i>Everything that Adam said</i>

00:04.320 --> 00:05.037
<i>about the Els,</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:06.270
<i>about who we are,</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:07.869
who we're meant to be,

00:08.039 --> 00:09.952
he believed I could
save the universe.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.714
Through fire, we are reborn.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.030
<i>I couldn't even save him.</i>

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
<i>It's chaos out there.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.160
<i>The whole city's gonna
descend into anarchy.</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:27.118
Who's gonna fill
this sudden power vacuum?

00:27.360 --> 00:28.077
Dru-Zod.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.556
I don't think he's come back
to save Krypton.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.016
I think he's come back
to rule it.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.520
House of Zod, House of El,

00:33.720 --> 00:34.995
you're my son.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.473
Doomsday is already
far beyond your reach.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.952
I just never thought
that you'd help them do it.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.200
We will take the creature
to your city.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.352
<i>And risk the lives
of everyone in Kandor?</i>

00:44.520 --> 00:46.432
You have sealed
Krypton's fate!

00:46.600 --> 00:48.114
Please don't do this.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.353
You're gonna have
to make a choice.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.515
Get away from me!

00:53.680 --> 00:55.672
<i>Black Zero
will shatter the guilds,</i>

00:55.880 --> 00:57.200
<i>strip the ranked
of their power,</i>

00:57.360 --> 00:59.397
and we will return
Kandor to its people.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.233
<i>The product of your union:</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:02.197
<i>Cor-Vex.</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:04.352
We have a child.
I believe in you.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.016
<i>Brainiac is taking power
from the generator</i>

01:08.040 --> 01:10.680
<i>that powers the city's
protective dome.</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:12.316
He's already here.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
We have to go.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.713
<i>How will you defeat
an alien conqueror?</i>

01:16.960 --> 01:18.110
Krypton.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.792
Your world is mine.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.316
Yes, I think it's time.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.233
Brainiac! He's here!

02:11.480 --> 02:13.790
We'll never find Seg
in all this.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Try his comms again.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.396
Seg! Come in!

02:17.560 --> 02:18.560
Seg!

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
There!

02:33.320 --> 02:34.515
What do we do?

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
I don't know.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.637
With that dome down,
we're not gonna last for long.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.280
Neither will they.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.949
We've got to find some sort
of way to get people indoors.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.880
Figure out how to...

02:46.560 --> 02:47.560
What happened?

02:49.240 --> 02:52.392
The Voice, he...
he was in pieces, then he...

02:52.560 --> 02:54.392
All of the sudden,
the dome just came down,

02:54.640 --> 02:56.871
and Brainiac was there.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.516
Wait, where's Jayna?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.871
She went off somewhere
in the catacombs.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.560
What did you do to her?

03:07.760 --> 03:09.479
I didn't do anything to her.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.400
It's true.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.829
He didn't.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.198
Look, if you're here
to try and force me

03:17.360 --> 03:20.159
to tell you where Doomsday is,
then you're wasting your time.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.230
The Cythonnites double-crossed
me; they hid it somewhere.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.639
That's not why we're here.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.158
We need you to take us
to the Fortress.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.680
We're gonna bring back
your grandfather.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.795
<i>We are not alone
in the universe!</i>

03:51.400 --> 03:53.631
Krypton is vulnerable!

03:53.920 --> 03:57.391
And praying to him
won't be enough to save it.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.556
Val of House El,

04:05.760 --> 04:08.753
for rebelling against the
lawful authority of the state,

04:08.920 --> 04:12.197
you leave me no choice but
to find you guilty of sedition.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.072
You are hereby
sentenced to death!

04:23.400 --> 04:24.550
Remember, Seg,

04:25.080 --> 04:28.517
keep believing
in a better tomorrow.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.195
Grandpa!

04:31.280 --> 04:32.680
I love you!

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
No!

04:45.080 --> 04:48.391
No! Grandpa!

04:48.920 --> 04:49.920
Grandpa!

05:02.560 --> 05:03.710
Where did he go?

05:04.600 --> 05:05.829
Into the Phantom Zone,

05:06.440 --> 05:07.840
a dimension that exists

05:08.000 --> 05:10.356
outside the normal
space-time continuum.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.520
How do you know that?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.160
Because I was trapped
in there with him.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.676
You mean you were sentenced
for leading a coup.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.840
Yes.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.376
Because the Council
that convicted me

05:19.400 --> 05:22.393
was as corrupt as the one
that condemned Val-El.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.475
That doesn't make sense.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.400
If Val went into the Phantom
Zone 14 cycles ago,

05:27.560 --> 05:29.496
and you were thrown in there
at some point in the future,

05:29.520 --> 05:30.590
how did you two even meet?

05:30.760 --> 05:32.558
Once inside the Phantom Zone,

05:32.760 --> 05:35.753
time and space have no meaning.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.515
Val told me that with her
father and the Voice of Rao

05:38.680 --> 05:40.478
believing that he was dead,

05:40.680 --> 05:42.911
it gave him opportunity
to seek out Brainiac,

05:43.080 --> 05:45.072
observe the way
the creature operated

05:45.320 --> 05:47.880
in order to help Krypton
prepare its defenses.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.952
Then why didn't he come back?

05:50.760 --> 05:51.880
Because he didn't have this.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.912
It was his only way out.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.755
So you stole it?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.474
You betrayed him.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.318
Only one of us could get out
with this.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.676
So, yes,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.070
I betrayed him,

06:07.720 --> 06:09.154
but not his mission.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.074
Who better to stop Brainiac,
hmm?

06:12.360 --> 06:14.192
A frail old man

06:14.480 --> 06:15.630
or a general?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.356
Such a mission required a Zod,

06:18.560 --> 06:19.880
not an El.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.200
Turned out I was both.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.112
With Doomsday lost, we need
more than just strength.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.640
We will need
your grandfather's

06:29.800 --> 06:31.632
unsurpassed intellect.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.551
I believe Val-El is our last,
best hope.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.640
You left my grandfather
stranded in that place

06:37.720 --> 06:40.235
with no way out,
but now that we need him,

06:40.400 --> 06:41.834
you suddenly have a way
to free him.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.656
If you hadn't kept this place
a secret from me,

06:43.680 --> 06:44.760
I could've done it anytime,

06:44.840 --> 06:47.071
if there had been a need.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.480
I assume you can activate it.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.600
So what's the catch?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.911
Someone has to go in
and get him.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.240
I'll go.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.519
You would get lost
in there forever.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.633
I know my way around.
I'll find him.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.456
Or now that you've failed
to stop Brainiac,

07:05.480 --> 07:06.960
this is your means of escape.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.994
No one who's ever
been in there

07:13.200 --> 07:16.398
would consider
going back an escape.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.439
How long will it take
to find him?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.396
For me,

07:22.560 --> 07:25.314
maybe hours, days,
a few weeks.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.440
For you,

07:27.720 --> 07:29.393
nearly instantaneous.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.358
Engaging
the Phantom Projector.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.394
Grandfather, it's me.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.954
It's Seg.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.991
You think I wouldn't
recognize my own grandson?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.997
The whole time
I was trapped in there,

08:56.160 --> 08:57.992
I was never far away.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.677
I figured out
how to access the past,

09:04.960 --> 09:07.680
the present, even the future.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.435
I caught glimpses
of you growing up.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.677
You were a beacon of light

09:13.120 --> 09:15.589
in that infinite darkness.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.952
And I am proud of the man
you have become.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.474
And you.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.317
We will settle
our differences

09:40.160 --> 09:42.072
once we've defeated Brainiac.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.073
Grandfather, he's here.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.232
We're hoping you know
a way to stop him.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.035
I'm afraid your hopes
are misplaced.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.358
There is no way
to stop Brainiac.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.880
It's the end of days,
isn't it?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.316
It's the beginning
of Day Zero.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.720
<i>People of Kandor,</i>

11:16.120 --> 11:18.476
<i>do not fear.</i>

11:18.680 --> 11:21.991
I am here to save you.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.154
Today is the beginning

11:28.320 --> 11:31.313
of your eternal life.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.432
You must have foreseen

12:07.600 --> 12:09.239
some means of saving Kandor.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
No.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.037
In fact, Brainiac has already
set his sights on Cygnus 4019,

12:15.200 --> 12:17.351
the next world he plans
to add to his collection.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.678
For all the futures
you witnessed,

12:21.400 --> 12:22.197
did you ever see one

12:22.360 --> 12:24.272
in which you would escape
the Phantom Zone?

12:25.760 --> 12:26.432
No...

12:26.640 --> 12:28.996
So then we can change things.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.674
No, you can't.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.714
From inside the Phantom Zone,

12:32.880 --> 12:35.520
I have seen a multitude
of possible futures.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.439
And they all end the same way:

12:37.600 --> 12:38.920
with Brainiac's victory.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.436
I assure you,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.240
Kandor will be taken.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.194
And anyone still there...

12:46.640 --> 12:48.677
will be trapped in there
with Doomsday.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.674
We have to evacuate the city.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.832
Why? So the survivors
can live long enough

12:54.040 --> 12:56.111
to watch Krypton explode
beneath their feet?

12:56.280 --> 12:57.760
Once the city is gone,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.117
the destabilization
of the planet's core

13:00.240 --> 13:02.596
makes the destruction
of Krypton inevitable.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.314
- Eventually, maybe.
- Definitely!

13:04.440 --> 13:06.096
Okay, fine, definitely,
but at least we can get

13:06.120 --> 13:07.800
as many people out
of the city before then.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.360
We'll deal with
the immediate problem

13:09.440 --> 13:11.120
then we can figure out
how to save Krypton.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.800
You know what future's
not gonna happen?

13:13.320 --> 13:15.152
One where I give up
without a fight.

13:15.880 --> 13:16.711
I'm going back to Kandor

13:16.880 --> 13:18.576
and I'm going to take
the fight to Brainiac,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.000
whatever the outcome.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.469
No, you're not.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.000
I don't need your permission.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.753
But you do need that skimmer.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.356
Please, Lyta,
you have to understand

13:28.520 --> 13:30.273
why that's too much
of a risk,

13:30.480 --> 13:32.711
A risk I'm willing to take.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.109
No, you wouldn't.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.736
Not if you knew the truth
of what it means

13:35.760 --> 13:37.717
to be a part
of Brainiac's collection.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.040
What do you mean?

13:43.200 --> 13:46.193
<i>The Collector of Worlds
offers eternal life.</i>

13:46.560 --> 13:48.358
<i>He claims magnanimity,</i>

13:48.720 --> 13:51.758
<i>seeing himself as
a conservationist of sorts.</i>

13:52.240 --> 13:54.038
<i>But what that really means
is that</i>

13:54.280 --> 13:56.875
<i>in order to perfectly
preserve his cities,</i>

13:57.280 --> 13:59.795
<i>those inside remain
rooted to the spot,</i>

13:59.960 --> 14:01.872
<i>immobilized,</i>

14:02.160 --> 14:03.435
<i>brains functioning,</i>

14:03.600 --> 14:05.080
<i>fully cognizant.</i>

14:05.840 --> 14:07.479
<i>He likes to study
their psyches</i>

14:07.640 --> 14:09.871
<i>for curiosity's sake.</i>

14:11.160 --> 14:13.914
<i>And that is how they remain:</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:16.396
<i>trapped in paralysis,</i>

14:16.560 --> 14:18.199
<i>unchanged,</i>

14:19.400 --> 14:21.517
<i>for all eternity.</i>

14:28.800 --> 14:30.553
We'll contact
the other city states.

14:31.080 --> 14:31.752
We'll get them to send

14:31.920 --> 14:33.480
as many transports
as they possibly can.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.756
Yes.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.296
I'm sure they'll waste
no time flying

14:36.320 --> 14:38.516
towards that giant skull
floating in the sky.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.680
I'm not giving up.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.717
I'm not either.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.639
You know there are
other ways into Kandor.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.918
The Cythonnites
have a tunnel that runs

15:04.080 --> 15:05.992
from the Outlands
into the city.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.833
You gonna tell me
where it is?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.200
No.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.999
I'm gonna show you.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.669
Why would you risk
going back into Kandor?

15:16.760 --> 15:17.840
Do you want to come or not?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.552
Doomsday could still be
the answer.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.078
We find the Cythonnites
who took him,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.715
and we force them to tell us
where they hid it.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.394
Of the many futures
I have seen,

15:35.600 --> 15:38.399
the one in which Doomsday
is used against Brainiac

15:38.560 --> 15:39.676
is, by far, the worst.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.073
Then you lied to me.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.513
You promised me there would
always be a better tomorrow.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.399
And as hard as it was,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I believed you.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.915
Mom and Dad, they believed you.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.078
They gave their lives
for your better tomorrow.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.677
Those were the empty words
of an naive old man.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.712
The only tomorrows I have seen

16:04.560 --> 16:07.837
are unimaginably worse,

16:08.520 --> 16:10.876
as your friends
will soon discover.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.397
Where'd they go?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.631
My mother was never one
to back down from a fight.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.954
I'm getting the hell
out of here.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.080
You don't have to tell me
twice. Rao can piss off.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.616
I'm getting on the next
skimmer out of here.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.710
What's happening?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.150
What are your orders?

16:29.600 --> 16:30.397
You tell us.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.115
Or find some high-ranking
officer, if there's any left,

16:33.280 --> 16:34.280
and ask them.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.630
All I know is,
I'm out of here.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.078
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.509
Commander Gar,

16:41.680 --> 16:45.037
you and Commander Bok
get your pilots ready to fly.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.720
We need to mount
a counterstrike

16:46.800 --> 16:48.439
while we still can.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.117
Commander Bok fled
the city this morning.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.551
And if you were smart,
you'd do the same.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.760
Right?

16:54.800 --> 16:55.870
Yes.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.750
You want to flee.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.315
Want to give up,

17:05.480 --> 17:06.800
surrender,

17:07.119 --> 17:08.520
ask for mercy.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.670
We are the tip of the spear

17:27.800 --> 17:30.076
that protects Kandor City!

17:30.240 --> 17:31.754
We do not give up,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.434
we do not surrender,

17:33.600 --> 17:37.355
and we do not ask for mercy.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.991
Nor do we give it.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.960
Grab as many supplies

17:52.040 --> 17:53.235
and weapons as you can carry.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.874
Brainiac is taking the city.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.599
Looks like we don't
have much time.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.759
And we don't have a way out
either.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.960
Reports say skimmers trying
to leave from the guilds

18:03.120 --> 18:05.510
are destroyed as soon as they
reach the city's border.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.000
Then we leave by foot,

18:08.720 --> 18:10.598
take our chances crossing
the Outlands.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.159
Head for Kryptonopolis.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.395
We'll never make it.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.038
No, not all of us.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.118
But there's a chance
some of us will.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
We have to,

18:22.680 --> 18:24.239
because we're taking the Codex
with us.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.155
You would risk
your life for that? Why?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.758
Without the Codex,
there is no point evacuating.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.952
It's the only way
our people live on.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.674
Then let's move.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.992
Oracle, I need you
to release my child, Cor-Vex.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.096
Have the cryo-creche's life
support function ready

18:48.120 --> 18:49.554
for immediate transportation.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.473
<i>Please confirm
your identity.</i>

18:54.880 --> 18:56.473
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

18:56.640 --> 18:58.359
<i>Your request is being
processed.</i>

18:58.520 --> 18:59.749
<i>Please stand by.</i>

18:59.920 --> 19:01.016
You had best hurry up
if you value

19:01.040 --> 19:02.520
whatever programming
has you believing

19:02.560 --> 19:03.755
in your own sentience.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.675
<i>Congratulations, your
request has been fast-tracked.</i>

19:07.840 --> 19:09.320
<i>A Medusoid has been dispatched</i>

19:09.480 --> 19:10.880
<i>for immediate delivery.</i>

19:11.080 --> 19:12.080
That's more like it.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.636
Lyta, come in.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.315
Can you hear me?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.520
Nyssa, do you read me?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
Nyssa!

19:22.480 --> 19:23.960
Look, we find Lyta and Nyssa,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.240
then we start getting people
out through this tunnel.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.669
We'll save as many as we can.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.560
Or we do a deal with Brainiac
and get him to spare the city.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.989
In exchange for what?

19:34.080 --> 19:35.096
Brainiac plunders
the universe

19:35.120 --> 19:36.793
for one thing: knowledge.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.516
We have something he could
never get his hands on.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.957
Knowledge of the future.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.670
- We offer him Val.
- What?

19:47.840 --> 19:49.672
He has seen not
just one future,

19:49.840 --> 19:52.150
but many possible futures.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.676
Surely Brainiac would spare
Kandor in exchange for that.

19:54.880 --> 19:55.880
No.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Never.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.153
You're not willing to
sacrifice the life of one man

20:03.400 --> 20:04.400
to save millions?

20:05.640 --> 20:08.712
What if one of those millions
of lives was your own, hmm?

20:08.880 --> 20:10.160
The reason it took
so long for me

20:10.320 --> 20:11.959
to figure out that
you were my father,

20:12.120 --> 20:14.316
was that my mother never
told me very much about you.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.398
She was too grief-stricken.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.631
All she ever said was
that you were lost

20:19.000 --> 20:21.799
in the bottling of Kandor.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.389
Nyssa-Vex.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.960
Seems somebody helped herself
to a little going-away present.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.520
Don't take
another step closer.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.393
Or what?

20:42.240 --> 20:45.517
No. You will not harm him.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.320
I just want to get my child
to safety.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.551
How long did you stand
by your father's side?

20:50.720 --> 20:52.074
Scheming and plotting,

20:52.240 --> 20:53.469
as you both set about creating

20:53.640 --> 20:55.040
the city that Kandor
has become.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.238
And now, as it faces its
reckoning, you want to flee?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.115
You're right.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.314
For too many cycles,
I helped my father

21:04.480 --> 21:06.073
divide our people.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.000
And I'm prepared
to pay the price for that.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.993
But my child is innocent.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.917
Please, give him the chance
to be free.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.120
Free?

21:22.720 --> 21:26.191
There's nothing free about
our society or anyone in it.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.477
Even the life of that
gestating fetus

21:28.680 --> 21:29.920
has already been predetermined.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.759
His name is Cor-Vex.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.832
You think the Genesis Chamber
decides who we are,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.229
but we can be more,

21:40.760 --> 21:42.080
if we choose.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.277
You still have no idea
about the society

21:44.440 --> 21:46.238
you helped your
father create,

21:47.680 --> 21:49.797
and your true place within it.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.392
Wraith Wing will approach
the Force Dome Generator

21:54.560 --> 21:55.835
in a Needle-Fly formation.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.713
This will keep him busy
while Teklon Wing

21:57.880 --> 21:59.314
hit it with ESD bombs.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.096
The pulse should give us
at least eight seconds.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.976
That's when we detonate
the charges Tantho Squad

22:03.000 --> 22:04.593
will set on the support struts.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.911
And we bring the whole platform
down on top of him.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.310
Any questions?

22:09.080 --> 22:11.390
This alien menace may have
conquered thousands

22:11.600 --> 22:13.080
of worlds before ours,

22:13.240 --> 22:16.790
but his reign of terror
ends on Krypton,

22:16.960 --> 22:20.840
for he has never
encountered the Sagitari.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.159
May Rao's grace be your shield.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.352
And light the way
to victory!

22:28.480 --> 22:30.756
Everyone head down to
Section Nine, lower level,

22:30.960 --> 22:33.520
there's a passage that'll
take you to safety. Go!

22:33.720 --> 22:35.154
Keep moving, come on,
keep moving!

22:35.320 --> 22:36.674
Keep moving. Come on!

23:11.560 --> 23:13.438
Keep moving. Stay together.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.720
<i>Wraith Wing, do you copy?</i>

23:34.960 --> 23:36.758
Teklon Wing, come in.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.636
Zaral Wing, come in.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.479
We did the right thing.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.400
Did we?

24:05.640 --> 24:08.474
How many men and women did
we just condemn to death?

24:09.640 --> 24:10.790
Yesterday,

24:12.080 --> 24:13.514
it was punishable by death

24:13.720 --> 24:15.473
to even acknowledge
the possibility

24:15.680 --> 24:17.717
of an alien presence.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.554
How were we supposed to know
how to defend against one?

24:21.200 --> 24:22.680
If your mother were here,

24:22.840 --> 24:26.914
she would have given
the exact same order.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.593
You know why she isn't here?

24:31.080 --> 24:32.514
Because I failed her.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.914
Like I failed everybody else.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.360
What do you mean?

24:39.920 --> 24:42.515
Do you know the reason
why she led the coup

24:42.720 --> 24:44.712
against the Voice of Rao?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.480
To save me.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.236
Even though it went against
everything she believed in,

24:52.400 --> 24:56.758
she chose me, and when I had
a choice to save her...

25:06.720 --> 25:09.076
<i>Lyta, come in!</i>

25:16.920 --> 25:17.637
Seg, where are you?

25:21.720 --> 25:23.040
I'm in the Rankless,

25:23.200 --> 25:24.976
we're trying to get people out,
and that includes you.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.680
Seg, I'm sorry.
I did what I thought was...

25:26.800 --> 25:28.359
<i>Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.</i>

25:28.520 --> 25:30.034
I'm glad that you're alive.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.157
<i>There's a lot of Sagitari
who aren't.</i>

25:32.440 --> 25:33.874
I... I sent them to their deaths.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.918
<i>And you saved
countless lives.</i>

25:36.240 --> 25:37.833
<i>In keeping
Brainiac distracted,</i>

25:38.120 --> 25:40.840
we've been able to get people
out of the city undetected.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
<i>Okay.</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:43.356
<i>Okay, I'll, um...</i>

25:43.720 --> 25:45.837
I'll dispatch the remaining
Sagitari units

25:46.000 --> 25:47.536
to help the stragglers
through the tunnels,

25:47.560 --> 25:49.597
and I will meet you
back at the Fortress.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.080
I'm counting on it.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.155
Is Nyssa with you?

25:53.440 --> 25:54.440
No.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.710
<i>Where is she?</i>

26:04.800 --> 26:06.200
We don't have time for this.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.909
Take the Codex.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.918
Meet me at
the rendezvous point.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.954
I will be there.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.477
Be careful.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.800
Do you remember where you were

26:25.960 --> 26:27.599
the day your mother died?

26:28.560 --> 26:29.198
What?

26:29.360 --> 26:30.999
Do you remember how she died?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.237
Why are you asking me this?

26:38.800 --> 26:40.837
It was a skimmer accident.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.035
She was on her way to Bokos
and got caught in the blizzard.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.674
And died out there.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.309
All alone.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.480
Except she wasn't alone.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.996
You were in that skimmer too.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.598
At least,
your original self was.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.155
That's impossible.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.637
Oracle, passcode:

27:04.880 --> 27:07.998
Hantha, Flame-bird,
Rokan, Oregus,

27:08.160 --> 27:10.197
2-9-7-1-8.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.279
Initiate Vara Protocol.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.589
What is this?

27:33.960 --> 27:35.235
Who are they?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.120
When that skimmer crashed,

27:37.200 --> 27:38.634
your mother died instantly.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.837
As for your predecessor,

27:42.800 --> 27:44.029
broken spine,

27:44.680 --> 27:46.194
fractured skull,

27:47.280 --> 27:48.839
countless internal injuries,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.310
but just enough neural activity

27:51.520 --> 27:54.080
for consciousness fusion.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.760
No.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.114
You're lying.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.200
My childhood,

28:05.880 --> 28:07.314
I remember it.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.435
My sisters,
I remember us playing.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.776
I remember us fighting.
I remember my father...

28:12.800 --> 28:13.916
Implants.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.311
Part of your
somatic reconditioning.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.915
This can't be real.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.151
I can promise you it is.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.233
Because I created it
inadvertently.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.031
My work was supposed
to cure disease,

28:31.760 --> 28:33.080
end suffering,

28:33.240 --> 28:34.515
extend life.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.440
But that wasn't enough
for the elite Houses.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.716
They wanted immortality.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.879
And your father
allowed them to manipulate

28:42.120 --> 28:43.839
my Codex technology

28:44.000 --> 28:45.240
so that when a body
was used up,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.040
it could be cast away
like an empty shell.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.114
Its consciousness transferred

28:50.400 --> 28:52.278
into a clone.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.596
My whole life has been a lie.

29:02.760 --> 29:03.760
Yes.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.840
Yes, it has been.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.078
But it doesn't
have to be anymore.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.079
Come on! Keep going!
Keep going!

29:23.280 --> 29:24.919
Nyssa! Nyssa, are you there?
Keep going!

29:26.600 --> 29:28.478
Nyssa-Vex, have you seen
Nyssa-Vex?

29:29.760 --> 29:31.592
Come on, come on,
keep going.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.717
Lyta's heading back
to the Fortress.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.080
Good.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.993
Make sure she's safe.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.515
Where are you going?

29:41.680 --> 29:43.194
I'm going to save Krypton!

29:44.840 --> 29:47.116
I will not let you
trade Val to Brainiac.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.640
I don't think
you can stop me.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.120
Val is your flesh
and blood too.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.072
You would sacrifice him
to that thing?

29:52.240 --> 29:54.277
And you would
sacrifice everyone else?

29:54.440 --> 29:55.656
You don't even know
if he'd take the deal!

29:55.680 --> 29:56.830
He might just kill you.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.912
Is that what
you're really afraid of,

29:59.080 --> 30:00.150
father?

30:01.240 --> 30:02.515
I didn't think so.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.797
If Brainiac
gets hold of Val,

30:09.960 --> 30:12.270
imagine what he could do
with that information.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.319
Imagine how many more worlds
he could conquer!

30:15.480 --> 30:18.837
The entire universe
will pay the price for this.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.593
If he spares Krypton,

30:22.160 --> 30:23.480
so be it.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.113
Intriguing.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.150
While the others attempt
to flee in terror,

30:58.320 --> 31:00.516
you come here willingly

31:01.360 --> 31:02.794
and unarmed.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.073
When you've existed
as long as I have,

31:21.240 --> 31:25.393
there are so few surprises
left in the universe.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.711
Then I have another for you.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.951
I have come to offer you
something.

31:30.120 --> 31:33.477
In exchange for sparing
this city and this planet,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.239
there is a man,

31:35.360 --> 31:38.671
he has found a way
to glimpse the future.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.433
I can give him to you.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.553
It amuses me

31:42.720 --> 31:45.235
how often desperation

31:45.360 --> 31:47.352
inspires creativity.

31:47.640 --> 31:51.714
You will do anything
to ensure your survival,

31:51.880 --> 31:54.873
say anything.

31:55.040 --> 32:00.672
Your Sentries have already
identified your next target:

32:00.920 --> 32:03.674
Cygnus 4019.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.191
You must be celebrating
at the prospect

32:07.400 --> 32:09.835
of adding that lethal
technology to your collection.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.276
And you would trust me to
abide by the terms of the deal

32:12.480 --> 32:14.551
when I could simply

32:15.880 --> 32:18.600
take the information

32:18.840 --> 32:19.840
and your city.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.555
I imagine for a 12th level
intellect,

32:23.160 --> 32:25.038
you would find
that dishonorable.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.556
Can the same be said of you?

32:43.560 --> 32:45.517
Your offer is sincere.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.719
You can have the universe,

32:52.960 --> 32:55.429
as long as I have Krypton!

32:55.600 --> 32:57.831
For such a selfish species,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.515
the lengths you'll go to
protect that which you love

33:00.640 --> 33:04.634
are...
extraordinary.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.456
Please, Grandpa,
we don't have much time.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.231
We've got to get you
out of here.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.720
Once Brainiac
knows my existence,

33:08.920 --> 33:09.920
there will be no hiding.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.235
But we have to try!

33:11.400 --> 33:12.800
There is only one way
to prevent him

33:12.960 --> 33:14.553
from gaining the knowledge
I possess,

33:14.760 --> 33:16.319
- and that is my death.
- No!

33:16.440 --> 33:18.113
I watched you die once before,

33:18.320 --> 33:19.336
and I'm not gonna
do that again.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.360
It's the only way!

33:20.400 --> 33:22.551
It's not! We can send you
back into the Phantom Zone!

33:22.720 --> 33:24.916
I assure you, death will be
a far kinder fate.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.269
I just got you back.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.355
I know.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.360
And I know how much pain
I've caused you,

33:36.640 --> 33:38.359
but I'm going to
have to do it again,

33:38.520 --> 33:40.955
because if Brainiac finds me,

33:41.200 --> 33:45.353
the entire universe
will suffer Kandor's fate.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
This way!

33:58.520 --> 33:59.954
Dev, we need to hurry.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
Dev...

34:08.679 --> 34:10.159
We need to h...

34:24.199 --> 34:25.199
<i>We can jump in a skimmer.</i>

34:25.360 --> 34:27.636
It'll give us time
to figure out our next move.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.996
I'm afraid it's too late
for that.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.240
Don't take another step.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.039
It's okay.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.390
I'll do it.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.876
I will!

35:32.600 --> 35:34.990
I don't believe you.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.439
You had as much chance
of convincing me

35:50.560 --> 35:52.517
you would kill
your own grandfather

35:53.040 --> 35:56.397
as convincing me
that what I see here...

36:00.480 --> 36:04.952
Is anything more
than a hologram.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.437
Oh, I wasn't trying
to convince you of anything.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.911
I just needed your big, green,
12th intellect ass

36:21.080 --> 36:22.116
up on that platform.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.714
No! No! No!

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
Hang on!

36:59.720 --> 37:00.720
I've got you!

37:05.400 --> 37:06.400
Seg!

37:12.320 --> 37:13.320
Seg!

37:22.920 --> 37:25.310
Start believing
in a better tomorrow again!

37:35.320 --> 37:36.549
Seg!

38:52.840 --> 38:53.512
Val, you can't!

38:53.720 --> 38:54.880
I will not condemn
my grandson

38:54.960 --> 38:56.110
to that place of
suffering!

38:56.280 --> 38:58.158
But you risk bringing
Brainiac back with him!

39:00.280 --> 39:01.316
No!

39:01.520 --> 39:02.715
No! Stop!

39:28.560 --> 39:30.870
My father's sacrifice

39:31.040 --> 39:32.633
will never be forgotten.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.551
The future of our city,

39:54.720 --> 39:57.155
and indeed, our entire planet,

39:57.320 --> 39:59.152
is now assured.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.194
Brainiac is no more!

40:02.920 --> 40:04.718
We are safe!

40:04.920 --> 40:08.800
We have faced the greatest
existential threat imaginable.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.873
And we have prevailed!

40:12.080 --> 40:13.176
We will never find ourselves

40:13.200 --> 40:16.750
in a position of such
vulnerability again.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.640
<i>Today marks the beginning</i>

40:19.800 --> 40:21.792
<i>of a new era.</i>

40:22.040 --> 40:24.396
<i>The Rankless will now
be given purpose</i>

40:24.560 --> 40:26.870
<i>and conscripted
into our Sagitari.</i>

40:27.080 --> 40:28.912
<i>Our military might</i>

40:29.080 --> 40:31.879
<i>will never again
be questioned.</i>

40:32.960 --> 40:35.031
<i>Kandor will no longer
need to fear</i>

40:35.240 --> 40:37.755
<i>the scourge of terrorism.</i>

40:38.240 --> 40:39.674
<i>There will be no insurgency,</i>

40:39.840 --> 40:41.399
<i>no uprising,</i>

40:42.120 --> 40:45.875
<i>for we all share
a common goal,</i>

40:46.320 --> 40:49.518
<i>to unite Krypton!</i>

40:50.240 --> 40:53.438
<i>Today, we look to the stars</i>

40:53.600 --> 40:55.273
<i>as we rebuild.</i>

40:56.800 --> 40:58.917
<i>Our planet will be the jewel</i>

40:59.080 --> 41:02.118
<i>in the crown of
an intergalactic empire.</i>

41:02.280 --> 41:04.351
<i>We will seek out
civilizations</i>

41:04.560 --> 41:06.870
<i>beyond our system.</i>

41:07.040 --> 41:10.636
<i>And we will conquer them!</i>

41:10.800 --> 41:13.315
<i>If they submit peacefully,</i>

41:13.480 --> 41:16.234
<i>they will fall
under my protection</i>

41:16.400 --> 41:18.960
<i>and shall never know
fear again!</i>

41:19.520 --> 41:21.239
<i>But if they do not,</i>

41:21.400 --> 41:23.437
then like the recalcitrant
leaders

41:23.600 --> 41:27.310
of Krypton's other city states
we see before us,

41:27.520 --> 41:30.672
eventually, they will all

41:31.120 --> 41:33.237
kneel before Zod!
