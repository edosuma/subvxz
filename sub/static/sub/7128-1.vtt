WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:02.870
It happened again.

00:03.220 --> 00:05.689
First time in six months.

00:06.450 --> 00:07.580
Tuesday morning

00:07.600 --> 00:10.120
I'm walking down market
street-- normal day,normal week

00:10.130 --> 00:12.360
Um,and by normal,
i mean oldnorm--

00:12.370 --> 00:15.250
Pre-aneurysm surgery removal normal.

00:15.270 --> 00:16.710
And then it happened.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.560
I heard the music.

00:20.970 --> 00:23.920
* Callin' out, around the world *

00:23.930 --> 00:27.130
* Are you ready for a brand new beat?*

00:27.680 --> 00:30.800
* Summer's here and the time is right *

00:30.820 --> 00:32.850
* For dancin' in the street *

00:32.870 --> 00:36.740
* They're dancin' in
Chicago (In the street)*

00:37.180 --> 00:39.820
* Down in New Orleans
(Dancin' in the street)*

00:39.830 --> 00:42.360
* In New York City(Dancing
In the streets)*

00:42.380 --> 00:47.010
* All we need is music, sweet music *

00:47.030 --> 00:50.200
* They'll be music, ev'rywhere *

00:50.220 --> 00:52.210
* They'll be swing an swayin'*

00:52.250 --> 00:53.830
* And records playin'*

00:53.860 --> 00:57.320
* Dancin-a in the street *

00:57.330 --> 01:01.690
* Ooh, it doesn't matter what you wear *

01:01.720 --> 01:04.519
* Just as long as you are there *

01:04.540 --> 01:07.120
* So come on, every guy *

01:07.170 --> 01:13.080
* Grab a girl, ev'rywhere
Around the world *

01:21.580 --> 01:23.770
You're making this up.

01:23.780 --> 01:27.670
Not the part about walking down
market street. That actually happened.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.640
I'm glad,after three months,

01:30.670 --> 01:33.350
That you're finally beginning
to take our work here seriously.

01:33.370 --> 01:34.570
I'm just trying to make a point.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.560
And that would be what, exactly?

01:36.580 --> 01:40.500
That my life is back to the way it was.

01:42.210 --> 01:44.050
And even if it wasn't,

01:44.070 --> 01:46.670
It wouldn't make me any less
competent to practice law.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.840
I've never said otherwise.

01:47.860 --> 01:51.800
In fact,i don't think your visions are
relevant to your ability to practice.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.260
That's something we agree on.

01:53.270 --> 01:56.010
We're far more in sync
than you might imagine,eli.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.840
That's great. So just sign my
permission slip, and i'll be on my way.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.060
It's not a permission
slip to go to the zoo,eli.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.930
It's a recertification of your
law license following your surgery.

02:05.950 --> 02:08.580
Can i go to court without it?

02:08.880 --> 02:11.980
Then it's a permission slip.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.440
Depression, especially in men, is
very common after major surgery.

02:16.450 --> 02:19.590
- i'm not depressed.
- many of them feel that something is missing afterwards.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.840
- it's called my law license!
- you don't need to raise your voice.

02:23.830 --> 02:25.490
So tell me,

02:30.010 --> 02:32.640
One very long week.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.380
You look lovely this morning.

02:34.390 --> 02:35.840
Love that suit on you.

02:35.870 --> 02:38.810
Now if i were to ask you to
pick some numbers at random--

02:38.820 --> 02:40.650
Say six
of 'em--

02:40.670 --> 02:41.580
What pops into mind?

02:41.620 --> 02:43.050
Patti,it's not even 9:00 a.m.

02:43.060 --> 02:46.880
9!That's good. How about 23?
How are you feeling about 23?

02:46.890 --> 02:49.160
- i can't help you win
at lotto. - not lotto--

02:49.170 --> 02:52.660
Super lotto.jackpot's upo $65 mil.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.330
Come on,eli. Hit me with some digits.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.680
I'm not psychic,patti.

02:55.710 --> 02:59.150
You predicted the earthquake. You
saved all of my friends atilver terrace.

02:59.160 --> 03:05.370
Do you rember a hospital and a surgery,
an aneurysm removed?Ring any bells?No?No?

03:05.380 --> 03:08.660
Whatever i was, i'm not anymore.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.850
What's this?

03:12.880 --> 03:15.210
Welcome back gift.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.700
Portable mp3 player,

03:17.720 --> 03:21.040
So you can hear music while you work.

03:23.180 --> 03:29.340
That's sweet. But,um, i just-- i-i
concentrate better...with quiet.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.760
- okay.
- Thanks.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.690
- well,that's interesting.
- what is?

03:35.700 --> 03:39.270
The woman who used to find your
auditory hallucinations annoying

03:39.680 --> 03:41.380
Now misses you having them...

03:41.390 --> 03:44.590
Or misses who youwere
when you were having them.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.260
Misses who i was?

03:46.290 --> 03:47.760
Do you ever listen to yourself?

03:47.770 --> 03:50.030
I'll put it another way.

03:50.050 --> 03:53.040
Has anything at work
anged during your absence?

03:53.050 --> 03:54.780
Uh,yes.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.950
Very big news.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.170
In other good news, our own
jordan wethersby has convinced

04:00.180 --> 04:03.040
Mather-young financial to
see the error of its ways

04:03.070 --> 04:06.960
And return to the w.p.k.fold.jordan.

04:07.250 --> 04:12.390
Yes. Pending a signing meeting, we will
once again have the opportunity to protect

04:12.400 --> 04:18.339
Mather-young's god-given rights to sell
predatory mortgages to unsuspecting buyers.

04:18.350 --> 04:21.450
I am so giddy,i can barely continue.

04:21.459 --> 04:24.110
Nevertheless-- what's the latest
from our pro bono department?

04:24.120 --> 04:27.660
We survived judgment on the pleadings
in the mcnivenwelfare fraud case.

04:27.680 --> 04:31.340
But i've got depos all week on
behalf of the eco preservation league

04:31.350 --> 04:34.300
And could really use another body.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.340
Would anyone care to step
up and assist ms.dekker?

04:39.090 --> 04:41.950
I wouldreally appreciate it...

04:41.960 --> 04:44.210
As would the bitterroot mountainsnail.

04:44.220 --> 04:47.640
The state bar prohibition against
me practicing includes depositions.

04:47.650 --> 04:53.190
So... Sadly,i am unable to take up
the noble fight for the mountainsnake.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.070
Mountainsnail.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.520
Speaking of maggie... Have you
reconciled your feelings for her?

04:58.530 --> 05:00.640
Yes,by not having feelings for her.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.900
The only thing between us is work.

05:02.910 --> 05:04.870
Please,eli. I'm drowning here.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.970
Since jordan formed the pro bono
department, you've been in recovery,

05:07.980 --> 05:09.750
And i'vebeenthe department.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.400
I billed 250 hours alone last month.

05:12.430 --> 05:14.230
And i'm so behind on my wedding plans.

05:14.260 --> 05:17.260
Scott and i are gonna end up
at a drive-thru chapel in vegas.

05:17.290 --> 05:19.280
Keith... Perfect timing.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.710
Maggie needs help avoiding
a drive-thru thing.

05:21.740 --> 05:24.190
Uh,totally jammed on
the bowman antitrust.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.310
Last week,the ninth circuit handed down a
decision that you could use to get bowman kicked,

05:27.320 --> 05:30.610
Buy you all the time in the world to
help maggie with her mountain lion.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.490
Huh? Everybody happy?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.710
Snail. Mountainsnail.

05:35.220 --> 05:40.040
The only thing going back to work seems to have
accomplished is reminding me how much I miss it.

05:40.050 --> 05:42.310
And--and what is it
you missed, exactly?

05:42.340 --> 05:48.570
****Marmed with nothing but
legal precedent and my wits,

05:48.580 --> 05:50.160
and sometimes not even the precedent.

05:50.190 --> 05:53.960
I miss the look in the client's eyes
that says that they totally trust you,

05:53.980 --> 05:57.520
that they depend on
you, that they--what?

05:57.530 --> 06:00.320
You're not buying any of this, are you?

06:00.330 --> 06:02.120
How are things with your brother?

06:02.140 --> 06:03.310
What does that have to d with anything?

06:03.330 --> 06:06.880
I'm the one who asks the questions,
eli. That's how this works.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.920
So... your brother?

06:09.930 --> 06:12.210
He's fine. I--
nothing's changed.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.790
You and beth are moving in together?

06:13.800 --> 06:16.880
Well, almost nothing.
Yeah. You cool with it?

06:16.890 --> 06:19.920
Oh, are you kidding? I'm arctic.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.060
Although I did share a room
with you for four years,

06:22.070 --> 06:25.170
so I know she's doing it despite
the drooling and bed-wetting.

06:25.190 --> 06:29.310
Oh, and to think beth said you wouldn't have a problem
with me moving in with the woman who deflowered you.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.640
Well, that's what makes it poetic.

06:30.650 --> 06:34.550
She was my first, and it
looks like you may be her last.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.990
- How's little ben doing?
- He's doing really well.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.580
So I guess you're...

06:40.600 --> 06:43.190
- kind of becoming a parent here.
- yeah.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.560
Well, there'd be pressure,
but dad set the bar pretty low.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.400
- You'll find it, you know.
- What?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.640
Someone to share your life with.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.670
So, you see, everything's fine.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.340
All right.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.770
All right, then what?

07:05.860 --> 07:08.000
- What are you doing?
- Calling your bluff.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.210
You're signing my permission
slip, just like that?

07:10.220 --> 07:13.660
It's not a permission slip,
and it's not just like that.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.290
We've had three months of sessions,
as you're so fond of pointing out.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.630
But as I'm fond of pointing out,

07:18.660 --> 07:23.180
these sessions haven't just been
about your competency to practice.

07:23.450 --> 07:26.150
And this is me proving it.

07:34.910 --> 07:39.310
that slip of paper isn't gonna fill the
void you're feeling in your life, eli.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.760
Practicing law won't do it, either.

07:41.770 --> 07:44.310
You're missing something,
it's true. But...

07:45.050 --> 07:48.280
it's nothing a law license can give you.

07:49.530 --> 07:52.210
Only one way to find out.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.570
or I guess you could just tell me.

08:05.340 --> 08:10.070
I think you're missing having a sense
of the divine in your everyday life.

08:10.080 --> 08:15.520
I think you're less happy now than when your
life was occasionally upended by the fantastic.

08:15.550 --> 08:20.150
I think that grace fulfilled you in
a way you didn't even know you needed.

08:20.160 --> 08:25.180
And the only thing crazy about you is the
fact that you don't seem to realize that.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.460
Thank you for signing
my permission slip.

08:33.490 --> 08:36.270
I'll see you soon, eli.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.450
Well...

08:41.900 --> 08:43.500
we've got a problem.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.760
Mr. Leightenrg's very agitated.

08:45.790 --> 08:49.120
Blood pressure's up, and
he's asking for a priest.

08:49.520 --> 08:54.290
Which is odd, considering he's in for a
relatively simple procedure, and he's jewish.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.650
Okay, I'll talk to him.

08:57.450 --> 09:00.510
Okay, mr. Leightenberg...

09:17.610 --> 09:20.110
um, excuse me, I...

09:24.090 --> 09:26.460
you have a deposit?

09:36.830 --> 09:39.070
Dr Stone?

09:40.450 --> 09:43.020
Mr. Leightenberg.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.340
should I call a doctor?

10:00.610 --> 10:04.140
eric langenhan from the state bar
called again and again and again.

10:04.150 --> 10:05.690
Tell him I got recertified yesterday.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.560
I did. He wants you to call him back.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.590
- Uh, you got a minute?
- Many.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.380
So, uh, what brings you by?

10:17.390 --> 10:19.990
You don't have a suitcase, and the
theme to "the odd couple" isn't playing,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.080
so I assume beth didn't
kick you out already.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.850
I wanted to see how you
were doing, actually.

10:27.870 --> 10:29.950
I'm fine.

10:31.780 --> 10:32.960
- You okay?
- Me?

10:32.970 --> 10:34.880
Great. Never better.

10:37.860 --> 10:41.080
you know, it's funny, I was, uh, talking
with a colleague of mine this morning,

10:41.110 --> 10:42.420
and, uh, your name came up.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.100
Uh, we were talking about
sensory hallucinations.

10:45.120 --> 10:50.130
So it made me realize that I-I had
never asked you what it was like,

10:50.140 --> 10:53.540
uh, when you were
having one of--of your...

10:53.560 --> 10:55.840
"sensory hallucinations"?

10:57.290 --> 11:00.150
w-was it--was it
like you were, um...

11:00.170 --> 11:04.810
oh, I don't know--like you were walking
into a room and then suddenly you were--

11:04.820 --> 11:06.660
you were someplace else?

11:06.690 --> 11:09.280
Nate, did something happen to you?

11:11.690 --> 11:14.090
I was with a-a patient...

11:14.930 --> 11:17.450
and... and then I...

11:17.460 --> 11:21.680
I-I-I was in a
different place--a bank.

11:22.050 --> 11:25.660
And I was there, but I wasn'T.

11:25.670 --> 11:30.100
And then there was this huge-ass crane
that came crashing down on me and the bank.

11:30.110 --> 11:34.400
And--and the next thing I knew, I was
facedown on the floor of my exam room.

11:34.740 --> 11:38.610
So... what do you think?

11:40.940 --> 11:43.630
I think a huge-ass crane is
gonna fall on top of a bank.

11:43.650 --> 11:45.600
So what? I-I...

11:45.610 --> 11:47.960
I-I just--I received
a message from...

11:47.970 --> 11:50.690
hold on. Just--just
tell me everything, okay?

11:50.700 --> 11:53.410
I need details. Start
from the beginning.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.360
Um, what kind of bank was it? Which
branch? Was it day? Was it night?

11:56.370 --> 11:59.160
- You know, all that stuff.
- you know, this is helpful, actually.

11:59.170 --> 12:03.150
I should've known that a healthy dose of crazy tunes from
you would be enough to put the whole thing in perspective.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.370
Nate, nate, it could be a sign.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.830
Yeah, yeah, a sign that says, "warning--when
moving in with a girl for the first time,

12:08.840 --> 12:11.320
you may experience
sudden bouts of insanity."

12:11.330 --> 12:12.310
- Nate!
- I'm fine, eli.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.090
I'll see you later.

12:14.590 --> 12:18.180
Dad, you don't seem like
yourself. Are you all right?

12:18.190 --> 12:22.080
Mather-young made billions
selling predatory mortgages,

12:22.130 --> 12:25.630
and W.P. K.Is once again
poised to make millions,

12:25.640 --> 12:29.290
ensuring it's never held
accountable for its behavior. So...

12:29.930 --> 12:32.480
yes, all is right with the world.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.130
It's not exaly coming across that way.

12:35.140 --> 12:39.580
I've always taken great pride that
this office was a paragon of efficiency.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.960
This firm, my fi, hummed...

12:42.970 --> 12:48.540
with precion, an equilibrium that was
upset when one of my junior associates

12:48.550 --> 12:51.340
began singing in staff meetings
and leaping from the furniture.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.830
Eli had a malformation
in his brain, dad.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.700
Whatever the cause, it had an effect.

12:56.710 --> 13:01.190
His cases, his crusades--
it was all so messy.

13:02.130 --> 13:07.100
And after my initial hesitancy, to my
great surprise, I felt invigorated by it.

13:07.130 --> 13:13.600
And I'd been waiting for his return, anticipating
the excitement he brings to this place, but...

13:13.610 --> 13:18.340
but the eli who returned was
more like the man I was engaged to

13:18.350 --> 13:21.590
and less like the one
who broke up with me.

13:24.200 --> 13:29.920
Perhaps the moral is that we lead
our lives independent of mr. Stone.

13:34.810 --> 13:38.430
I'm late for my signing meeti.

13:45.780 --> 13:49.690
goji berry chai with ginseng powder.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.690
Drink very slowly.

13:52.710 --> 13:55.420
Brain freeze bad for chi.

14:03.830 --> 14:05.730
dude. Long time.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.790
Four months.

14:11.470 --> 14:12.880
I like what you've done with the place.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.660
Yeah, it's been like
this for a while now.

14:14.670 --> 14:18.890
When did you expand your practice to include
the spiritual fulfillment of the smoothie?

14:18.920 --> 14:23.330
Paying a guy to stick needles in your face
is the first luxury to go in a recession.

14:23.350 --> 14:24.990
It's all about diversification.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.040
Like, uh, like practicing law
and being a messenger from god?

14:29.060 --> 14:31.030
An attorney who's also a prophet.

14:31.050 --> 14:33.440
Now that would just
be crazy, wouldn't it?

14:33.450 --> 14:36.650
Well, maybe you should break
out your straightjacket again.

14:37.570 --> 14:40.660
Eli... did you have a vision?

14:41.190 --> 14:42.040
Almost.

14:42.050 --> 14:44.610
How do you almost have a vision?

14:44.830 --> 14:46.990
nate had it.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.260
You don't believe me?

14:50.220 --> 14:52.730
Don't you want to believe me?

14:52.750 --> 14:55.890
Did I ever tell you about the
last time I went to see the dead?

14:55.910 --> 14:57.820
At, like, a cemetery?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.250
at, like, a concert.

15:00.260 --> 15:05.070
The grateful dead-- winterland
arena, new year's eve 1978.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.490
Music filled me up, like
my ears could breathe it in.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.790
Something felt changed in me.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.610
I felt a part of something bigger.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.550
I could taste magic and speak art
and hear the turn of the universe.

15:17.570 --> 15:23.160
Even as the show was ending, I remembered
thinking I was at the beginning of a new world.

15:24.430 --> 15:29.630
But the next morning when I woke up, all
I had was a headache and a ticket stub.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.120
Life was... plain again.

15:33.130 --> 15:36.650
I still remember being a
part of something magical.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.380
But I can't hear it anymore
as much as I might want to.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.780
Does any of that sound familiar?

15:48.690 --> 15:50.610
I'm sorry I dropped out of your life.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.850
I know you didn't want
me to have the surgery.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.570
You had your reasons. It's
not for me to judge them.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.830
But what you have to realize, eli,

15:58.840 --> 16:03.270
is your life wasn't the only one
affected by what was happening with you.

16:04.350 --> 16:09.080
Everyone in your life-- your friends,
your brother, your co-workers--

16:09.090 --> 16:11.980
we were all touched in some way.

16:11.990 --> 16:17.590
And the more you changed your life, the
more you enabled us to change our own.

16:17.940 --> 16:22.590
but the surgery had consequences,
and not just for yourself.

16:22.600 --> 16:28.190
I know you think you took back your life, eli,
but you took something from all of us, too.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.700
I know.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.120
And I'm sorry.

16:33.130 --> 16:36.940
I guess... I didn't realize
everything that would change.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.110
Well, maybe that's the thing, dude.

16:40.120 --> 16:44.040
Maybe you're someone who doesn't realize
something's missing till it's gone.

17:00.870 --> 17:03.600
***********

17:03.610 --> 17:09.040
**************

17:09.050 --> 17:12.329
*****************

17:12.339 --> 17:13.410
what's going on?

17:13.420 --> 17:15.599
There was an accident at credit dauphin.

17:15.609 --> 17:16.869
A crane fell.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.000
Credit dauphin bank?

17:18.010 --> 17:20.900
No, credit dauphin spa and resort.

17:20.910 --> 17:23.250
Jordan was inside.

17:27.430 --> 17:29.220
- ellen?
- Oh, eli.

17:29.230 --> 17:32.120
That's why I'm calling you...

17:32.130 --> 17:34.000
Damn it, he's still not picking up.

17:34.010 --> 17:35.080
maybe he was running late.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.710
No. I called him.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.870
He said he couldn't talk,
he was in a meeting...

17:39.880 --> 17:43.350
To rehire a client-- one that
fired us last year because of you.

17:43.360 --> 17:43.920
Taylor...

17:43.930 --> 17:46.440
's gonna be okay. I promise.

17:50.450 --> 17:52.430
I spoke to my buddy over
at the mayor's office.

17:52.440 --> 17:57.870
They pulled 33 people from the rubble, and
they think there's 18 still in the bank.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.970
Do they think...

18:00.370 --> 18:03.350
- I'm gonna do down there.
- I'm going, too.

18:05.470 --> 18:07.020
- Eli.
- Yeah?

18:07.030 --> 18:10.010
Look, I'll deny ever having been this
in touch with someone else's feelings,

18:10.020 --> 18:14.830
but when it comes to you, taylor
doesn't always think straight.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.420
You sure she needs to be
any more bent right now?

18:21.260 --> 18:22.940
you saw?

18:22.950 --> 18:23.910
Nate, it's okay.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.200
Eli, what is happening to me?

18:25.220 --> 18:28.050
We're gonna figure that out. Okay?

18:28.850 --> 18:31.030
you gotta be kidding. There
are people dead or dying.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.510
I am not sure that right now is the
best time to relax my lower back.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.820
When eli had his visions last year, we'd use
acupuncture to help him recall the experience.

18:38.830 --> 18:41.530
C-could we just go directly
to the seance, ple--

18:41.540 --> 18:45.460
the needle induces a state of hypnosis,
allowing you to relive the event.

18:45.470 --> 18:48.980
You've got--all right, even if that
weren't a completely terrifying possibility,

18:48.990 --> 18:50.340
what would be the point?

18:50.370 --> 18:52.220
We need to know if jordan made it out.

18:52.230 --> 18:55.180
And the only way for us to
know that would be for me to...

18:55.190 --> 18:57.450
go back in. Please.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.740
if I start gettin' stalked
by the other guy from wham!

19:00.750 --> 19:03.850
relah. Cloh eye.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.000
- What?
- It's a long story.

19:08.110 --> 19:10.840
Nobody put a gun to anyone's head.

19:10.850 --> 19:15.600
What, it never occurred to them it wasn't the
smartest idea to buy a house completely on credit?

19:15.610 --> 19:19.690
It's not our job to protect
them from their own stupidity.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.250
Gentlemen, I'm afraid...

19:24.500 --> 19:27.970
I-I'm afraid this meeting
has been premature.

19:27.980 --> 19:30.360
Premature? Jordan, you were
the one who asked for it.

19:30.370 --> 19:36.470
It's true, but now I'm exercising
my prerogative to change my mind,

19:36.480 --> 19:42.240
as well as my first amendment right to
tell you that you and your insipid company

19:42.250 --> 19:44.660
are pond scum.

20:08.870 --> 20:11.290
breathe, nathan. You're all right.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.370
He's still in the bank, eli.

20:14.390 --> 20:16.220
But he's not in the conference room.

20:21.150 --> 20:22.090
how do you know that?

20:22.110 --> 20:23.880
I just do, lieutenant.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.270
Well, thank you, that's--
that's very helpful.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.790
I'm definitely gonna reallocate
men and resources now.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.600
How do you know
that there aren't--

20:30.610 --> 20:33.580
get two men with ka-bars
on that northwest wall.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.420
How do you know that there aren't
any survivors inhe stairwell?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.980
Because people don't take the
stairs when there's elevators.

20:37.990 --> 20:41.780
Look, even if they did, the
crane to out the support wall.

20:41.790 --> 20:43.420
The building basically imploded.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.930
So if there's anybody in that
stairwell, they're probably not alive.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.320
what are you doing here?

20:47.340 --> 20:49.540
He's telling me my search crews
are seching in the wrong place.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.530
Well, can't you just send
a team in just to be sure?

20:51.540 --> 20:54.330
Look, this whole area
is a house of cards.

20:54.350 --> 20:58.220
If I open up new search areas,
weesould dtabilize the entire site.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.990
So if you'll excuse me...

21:00.010 --> 21:01.470
what the hell are you doing?

21:01.480 --> 21:04.900
Jordan left the meeting. He's not in
the conference room. He's in a stairwell.

21:04.910 --> 21:07.490
- It's just like the earthquake.I
know he's-- - It's like the earthquake?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.220
they're searching for
him in the wrong place,

21:09.230 --> 21:12.630
which means he'll either die while they do
that or--or get killed when the debris shifts.

21:12.650 --> 21:14.420
What are you, a search
and rescue expert now?

21:14.430 --> 21:15.500
Nate, what is he doing?

21:15.520 --> 21:17.890
They won't listen to me, and they
probably won't even listen to you.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.440
I think what we need is a court order.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.290
An injunction?

21:20.310 --> 21:23.140
Eli, you are having some
sort of breakdown, okay?

21:23.150 --> 21:24.960
Just get away from here!

21:24.990 --> 21:26.960
- Get away from me!
- Come on.

21:39.190 --> 21:40.880
Now I know why dad drank so much.

21:40.890 --> 21:43.940
Dad drank so much because he had these visions,
and he didn't know what to do about them.

21:43.950 --> 21:46.940
I know what to do, but I can't
go to court without a client.

21:46.950 --> 21:49.340
What about the family members of
the other people who are trapped?

21:49.350 --> 21:51.930
Lieutenant o'shea is right.
Nobody takes the stairs.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.900
If I hadn't have broken up with taylor,
jordan would be my father-in-law by now.

21:54.910 --> 21:56.090
I'd have standing myself.

21:56.100 --> 22:00.020
And then what would you do-- go before a
judge and say that you're on retainer to god?

22:00.030 --> 22:01.610
yeah, that's probably not plan "A."

22:01.620 --> 22:04.860
You'll figure it out,
eli. You always do.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.310
Eli? You're gonna want to hear this.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.870
Is the recovery effort
endangering my husband's life?

22:11.880 --> 22:12.510
Yes.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.900
And you think you can get a judge to
force them to look in the right place?

22:15.910 --> 22:17.530
I think we've got to try.

22:17.550 --> 22:19.630
Then let's go to court.

22:19.650 --> 22:21.260
Okay.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.230
What did you say to her?

22:26.240 --> 22:29.020
I told her you saved my fiance's
life during the earthquake,

22:29.030 --> 22:31.820
and I told her I never
thanked you for it.

22:33.890 --> 22:36.560
Um, call judge phelps'
clerk. He as me favor.

22:36.570 --> 22:40.120
Tell him I need five minutes
and a short order of notice.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.300
mr. Stone?

22:42.310 --> 22:45.650
I wasn't aware that your license
to practice had been relaminated.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.870
Uh, yesterday, as a matter of
fact.Sir, if you don't mind--

22:47.890 --> 22:49.000
yeah, if you hadn't noticed,

22:49.010 --> 22:51.050
the firm's in a bit of
a crisis at the moment.

22:51.060 --> 22:53.710
Se os anff time for your
iugural court appearance.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.050
Actually, I'm seeking an injunction
against the search and rescue team.

22:56.060 --> 22:58.170
Oh, you're even more deranged
than I wouldave guessed.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.260
Jordan is down there, you imbecile.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.500
Jordan--the man who brought
you into this firm--your mentor,

23:03.510 --> 23:05.170
the man who's protected
you at every turn--

23:05.190 --> 23:07.380
yes, and they're looking
for him in the wrong place.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.900
- What are you talking about?
- I really don't have the time right now, sir.

23:09.910 --> 23:10.960
Sorry. I have to get to court.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.400
Mist--

23:13.590 --> 23:15.560
patricia, get taylor
on the phone for me.

23:15.570 --> 23:16.920
You want me to do what?

23:16.940 --> 23:20.340
Order the city to direct its search and
rescue am to search for mr. Wethersby

23:20.360 --> 23:23.310
in the former stairwell instead
of where they're presently digging.

23:23.330 --> 23:26.270
You're not even coming to me
with a ouija board, mr. Stone.

23:26.300 --> 23:30.240
I'm representing as an officer of the
court I know mr. Wethersby's well-being,

23:30.270 --> 23:33.180
if not his life, to be at risk
unless you grant my motion.

23:33.190 --> 23:36.810
Which you want me to do ex parte without
even hearing argument from the city.

23:36.830 --> 23:38.710
I think I can help
with that, your honor.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.310
Martin posner, matthew dowd and taylor
wethersby of wethersby posner & klein.

23:42.340 --> 23:45.210
We'd like to enter our appearance on
behalf of the city of san francisco.

23:45.230 --> 23:47.470
We volunteered our services pro bono.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.840
Imagine where we got that idea.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.160
The standard on an injunction
is irreparable harm.

23:57.180 --> 24:00.730
There is nothing more irreparable
or harmful than a man's death.

24:00.740 --> 24:04.990
Which could ju as easily result from
indulging mr. Stone's flight of fancy.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.780
That's an offensive
characterizatiur, yo honor.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.400
The accident site is unstable.

24:08.420 --> 24:12.740
If they dig near the stawell, it
could collapse and crush my fath--

24:13.220 --> 24:15.830
crush mr. Wethersby
where he actually is.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.500
The search and rescue
team is playing a hunch.

24:17.510 --> 24:19.300
That's an offensive characterization.

24:19.310 --> 24:22.540
When it's backed by a combined 50
years of experience and training,

24:22.550 --> 24:23.870
it's a little more than a hunch.

24:23.890 --> 24:25.520
which is all you have.

24:25.530 --> 24:29.340
Actually, I have my own expert with
years of training and experience,

24:29.360 --> 24:32.630
and I would like the court
to hear from him... her.

24:33.450 --> 24:36.000
sara nave is a structural engineer.

24:36.030 --> 24:38.720
Sara nave is a structural engineer.

24:38.740 --> 24:41.630
Objection, your honor. This is the
first we're hearing about this witness.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.490
I'll give you an hour's
continuance to get up to speed.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.510
why not come right out
with it? You had a vision.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.590
Not exactly. I had access to a vision.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.840
What the hell does that mean?

24:50.850 --> 24:55.030
It means I think that there's a better way
to get jordan out alive-- maybe the only way.

24:55.210 --> 24:57.750
Right.I completely forgot
about george michael's big hit,

24:57.760 --> 24:59.730
"only i know what to do in a disaster."

24:59.740 --> 25:01.750
Taylor, I need you to trust me.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.840
Would you trust you?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.060
If it were your father buried
under a sea of concrete,

25:06.080 --> 25:09.460
would you put his life in the hands of
somebody with a history of mental instability,

25:09.480 --> 25:10.850
recuperating from brain surgery?

25:10.860 --> 25:14.160
No. Someone with a history of
knowing more than he could know.

25:14.440 --> 25:18.190
If that's what you believe,
go in there and tell the judge.

25:21.690 --> 25:24.880
That's why I can't believe you,
eli. You don't even believe yourself.

25:31.060 --> 25:34.530
Nate! Nate!
Call 9-1-1. Nate!

25:36.590 --> 25:37.990
We don't know it's an aneurysm.

25:38.010 --> 25:43.210
So let's just wait for the M. R. I.
To come back, and one step at a time.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.920
What am I supposed to tell beth?

25:44.940 --> 25:47.700
After everything she's
been through with ben...

25:47.990 --> 25:49.660
how much more is she supposed to take?

25:49.670 --> 25:54.010
Come on. You're nate--
rock star chick magnet, mm?

25:54.020 --> 25:58.180
Probably be the first guy in history to
successfully operate on his own brain aneurysm.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.980
If I botch it, can I sue myself?

25:59.990 --> 26:02.140
Oh, I'll take care of that.

26:06.350 --> 26:07.480
hello?

26:07.510 --> 26:10.190
mr. Stone? This is dr Langenhan.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.880
- Uh, doctor?
- Yes.

26:11.890 --> 26:13.170
I've been trying to reach you.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.970
Ah, yeah. You know, this--this
isn't really the best time.

26:15.980 --> 26:21.430
You're aware that you're not permitted to set foot
inside a courtroom until I sign off on it, right?

26:21.440 --> 26:23.150
Well, I-I think there's
some kind of mistake,

26:23.160 --> 26:26.280
'cause I got the clean bill
of mental health yesterday.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.370
From who?

26:42.120 --> 26:45.600
that office has been
vacant for three months.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.300
can I help you?

26:49.390 --> 26:52.520
Uh, yeah, I was--I was
thinking of--of renting it out.

26:52.540 --> 26:53.660
Do you mind if I take a look?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.340
Sure.

27:02.550 --> 27:05.440
It's not like there's
anything in here to steal.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.810
I am officially losing it.

27:16.160 --> 27:19.190
That is cause for concern.

27:19.870 --> 27:23.020
Maybe you should seek professional help.

27:45.770 --> 27:48.070
You gonna say anything?

27:48.080 --> 27:50.800
I don't know your name.

27:50.810 --> 27:55.060
3 months, 12 sessions,
and I don't know your name.

27:56.590 --> 28:02.630
it's--it's not even on the, uh, form which
you signed this morning, which isn't signed.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.810
- It's very interesting.
- Isn't it, though?

28:04.820 --> 28:10.670
No, I mean it's interesting that with a bank lying
on top of jordan and your brother lying in a hospital,

28:10.680 --> 28:15.480
you would take time out from what's obviously
a fairly busy day to come talk to me.

28:15.500 --> 28:21.350
Is it possible that, uh, this whole
time, you have been nothing more than A...

28:22.270 --> 28:24.180
supersized vision?

28:24.190 --> 28:26.560
Well, anything is possible, eli.

28:26.570 --> 28:29.530
Isn't that the very essence of faith?

28:29.540 --> 28:32.020
That's not an answer.

28:33.530 --> 28:36.040
Are you...

28:36.050 --> 28:40.580
"god" can be a narrow term,
but let's say, hypothetically,

28:40.590 --> 28:45.410
that I am, or, to use a term from
your line of work, that I'm his...

28:45.440 --> 28:47.790
fiduciary.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.140
you had the aneurysm removed.

28:50.150 --> 28:55.060
You were quite clear that you wanted your
life to return to what you consider normal.

28:55.070 --> 28:57.890
But you're meant for so much more, eli.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.890
You're one of those people for whom
"normal" is a failure of potential.

29:01.910 --> 29:05.200
Oh, so you're punishing me
by dropping a bank on jordan?

29:05.230 --> 29:08.670
That's not the way of things.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.420
There's no "you don't scratch
my back, I'll smite yours."

29:12.440 --> 29:14.790
Then what the hell do you call
giving my brother an aneurysm?

29:14.800 --> 29:17.020
Really with the language.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.850
And three months of therapy?

29:18.870 --> 29:23.520
Eli, I would have liked to have
seen such passion for your own life.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.880
And i would have liked to have known
that you weren't state-certified!

29:25.910 --> 29:29.070
Just answer my question. Are
you--are you punishing me?

29:29.080 --> 29:32.530
Jordan wasn't the only
person in that bank.

29:32.540 --> 29:38.650
As for nate, I'm sure someone has told you
that subarachnoid aneurysms are hereditary.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.210
It's nate or me, isn't it?

29:44.250 --> 29:47.180
You recused yourself from the position.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.910
You wanted to have a normal
life again.Wish graed, but--

29:49.920 --> 29:51.940
no--n-not nate.
It can't be him.

29:51.950 --> 29:52.650
Why not?

29:52.680 --> 29:56.370
He seems to have your compassion,
your kindness, your heart.

29:56.380 --> 29:59.540
Really, the men in the
stone family are good stock.

29:59.570 --> 30:02.750
He has met someone he wants to spend
the rest of his life with, okay?

30:02.770 --> 30:07.600
And she has a son, and they're gonna have
more kids, and they're gonna be a family.

30:07.620 --> 30:10.170
What are you saying, eli?

30:13.720 --> 30:15.770
Give it to me.

30:15.790 --> 30:19.060
Just... just give me back the aneurysm.

30:21.370 --> 30:23.830
I'll do it.

30:25.730 --> 30:27.500
please.

30:27.510 --> 30:30.830
Because he's--
he's all that...

30:32.300 --> 30:35.370
he's--he's-- he's
better than me. He'S...

30:40.900 --> 30:46.310
if we're gonna dance again,
no more standing on our shoes.

30:46.730 --> 30:50.000
From now on, you're gonna have to lead.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.960
what do you mean?

30:53.300 --> 30:56.050
I think you know.

31:03.190 --> 31:04.780
Is that it?

31:04.790 --> 31:09.050
Your entire expert opinion is based on a
15-minute glance at the building blueprints?

31:09.070 --> 31:11.680
None of us are working with a
lot of time here, ms. Wethersby.

31:11.690 --> 31:13.630
We're--we're all making
our best judgment calls.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.460
Are you willing to
bet your life on yours?

31:15.470 --> 31:16.060
Well--

31:16.090 --> 31:19.350
but you're willing to
risk jordan wethersby'S.

31:21.550 --> 31:23.620
I have nothing further.

31:23.640 --> 31:27.890
Since time is of the essence, I'm
going to deliver my ruling now.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.550
Your honor, I'd hope you'd
at least wait for mr. Stone.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.280
Mr. Stone is dealing
with a family emergency,

31:33.290 --> 31:35.700
and I don't foresee him getting
back in here anytime soon.

31:35.730 --> 31:38.140
Because you can't predict
the future, your honor.

31:38.150 --> 31:40.090
Good timing, mr. Stone.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.990
I was just about to rule against you.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.260
Before you do, I would like
to make a closing statement.

31:45.290 --> 31:49.620
Your honor, mr. Stone suffers from a
well-documented neurologic condition.

31:49.660 --> 31:54.900
As well-documented as the fact that I predicted
the silver terrace earthquake last year.

31:55.350 --> 31:57.330
And if it's documentation
that's the issue,

31:57.350 --> 32:02.710
I could pack this courtroom with people whose
lives I've changed through the other, uh...

32:05.330 --> 32:08.580
well, through the other...
visions that I've had...

32:09.500 --> 32:13.210
sent to me by some higher
power... perhaps divine.

32:13.220 --> 32:16.150
Your honor, the man is one
banana short of a fruit salad.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.810
I know, I know.

32:17.820 --> 32:23.000
Sounds crazy, particularly here,
a place of evidence, not faith,

32:23.040 --> 32:26.800
a place where faith cannot
be considered as evidence.

32:26.810 --> 32:30.480
But this is still a place where
witnesses swear on the bible...

32:30.740 --> 32:35.400
where the bailiffs call the
court to order with prayers.

32:36.300 --> 32:40.780
Courts acknowledge the
existence of a higher power.

32:40.810 --> 32:46.870
So why not acknowledge the possibility of
a lawyer who receives messages from him?

32:51.170 --> 32:54.000
You don't have to believe, your honor.

32:54.010 --> 32:57.370
But believe that I do...

33:00.130 --> 33:05.680
I believe that jordan wethersby
will die unless you intervene here.

33:08.650 --> 33:11.860
I believe it so much that
I'm willing to put my--my--

33:11.890 --> 33:16.480
my career and my reputation
on the line to say so.

33:24.580 --> 33:28.190
There's a part of me that
does believe you, mr. Stone...

33:29.360 --> 33:31.850
certainly wants to.

33:32.700 --> 33:37.560
But even if I did, I
swore an oath of my own

33:37.570 --> 33:39.610
that when I put on this robe,

33:39.640 --> 33:45.680
I'd base my decisions on what can be
proven over what can merely be believed.

33:46.090 --> 33:50.310
Plaintiff's motion
for T. R. O... denied.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.470
all rise.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.830
- Taylor?Taylor, I need
to-- - eli, let it go.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.860
Hey, wait, okay?

34:10.870 --> 34:14.820
I just--I just doused my career in
gasoline and lit a match in there.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.770
I'm all-in now.

34:17.060 --> 34:20.290
I... I think that you're scared, okay?

34:20.300 --> 34:23.830
Not just for your father, but I think that
you're scared that I could be for real,

34:23.840 --> 34:25.900
and, hey, that is scary.

34:25.929 --> 34:27.989
Used to scare the utap o of me.

34:28.010 --> 34:29.540
But not anymore, okay?

34:29.550 --> 34:31.730
Not afraid anymore.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.580
You can believe me.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.830
You can.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.840
Even if I did...

34:41.860 --> 34:43.469
you gotta talk to lieutenant o'shea.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.969
He may well listen to you,
and if there's even a chance--

34:45.980 --> 34:48.139
mr. Stone, that is quite enough.

34:48.150 --> 34:52.239
The only reason I'm not firing you right
now is I think jordan will want that honor.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.290
Shut up, martin.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.139
How do we get ahold
of lieutenant o'shea?

34:56.159 --> 34:59.100
- Taylor, you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.240
I believe him.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.710
Mrs. Wethersby, miss
wethersby, we got him.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.200
We got your dad. He's alive.

35:27.010 --> 35:29.160
- Oh, thank you.
- thank you.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.070
Oh, my god.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.620
there's some bruising to his sternum.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.840
He's also exhibiting
signs of a mild concussion.

35:41.870 --> 35:42.980
But other than that?

35:42.990 --> 35:44.960
Well, we'll do x-rays and
a C. T.Scan at the hospital,

35:44.970 --> 35:48.590
but all in all, I'd say
someone's looking out for him.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.260
Thank you.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.310
I know you hate crying, dad.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.990
I think today we can make an exception

36:05.890 --> 36:08.370
let us get him to the hospital, okay?

36:08.380 --> 36:10.210
I'm going with you.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.090
Did you find jordan?

36:24.110 --> 36:27.580
Yeah. They got him, and he's fine.

36:28.850 --> 36:31.300
Yeah, well, that seems to
be going around. I, uh...

36:31.640 --> 36:37.320
I got the results from my M. R.
I. Back, and, uh, it was negative.

36:37.850 --> 36:40.560
Negative. I... I don't have an aneurysm.

36:40.570 --> 36:42.950
We need to do another M. R. I. , Nate.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.650
I told you, I'm fine.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.280
No, not for you. We need to test me.

36:49.210 --> 36:51.000
Rym ve sorry.

36:51.020 --> 36:56.040
But it's not uncommon for the clipped
aneurysm to basically grow back,

36:56.050 --> 36:58.270
which seems to have
happened in your case.

36:58.290 --> 37:00.890
I don't know why we
didn't pick it up before.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.100
I pulled your films from last
month, and they were clean.

37:05.630 --> 37:08.060
It's okay.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.110
you knew.

37:18.430 --> 37:21.120
I have to go and see jordan.

37:25.450 --> 37:27.530
how is he--
the new tenant?

37:27.540 --> 37:30.030
Good. He's been asking for you.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.060
Well, I'll never have a better
chance at a raise then now, so...

37:35.690 --> 37:39.900
you really knew where he
was. You really... saw it.

37:39.910 --> 37:41.160
Yeah.

37:41.180 --> 37:43.310
I can't get my head around that.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.220
Welcome to my days and nights.

37:46.230 --> 37:50.740
When it first... started... you
know, when we were still together...

37:51.450 --> 37:54.130
I should have listened.

37:55.730 --> 37:58.440
You listened now.

38:06.690 --> 38:10.010
you had a good day.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.530
I'm sorry if I, um...

38:14.600 --> 38:17.620
well, we both care about taylor.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.690
Might be the only
thing we have in common.

38:19.710 --> 38:22.110
Please, god, let that be true.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.030
You know he uses more hair
product than you, right?

38:26.040 --> 38:28.290
Yeah, it's part of his charm.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.020
eli.

38:43.390 --> 38:44.900
How are you feeling, sir?

38:44.930 --> 38:48.810
Eh, like I was just pulled out
from under a 3-story building.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.880
I was coming to see you.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.620
You're lying in a hospital bed.

38:57.630 --> 39:02.460
When the building collapsed,
I was coming to see you.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.970
I needed to tell you.

39:07.010 --> 39:09.350
Tell me what?

39:09.360 --> 39:11.630
I know what we have to do now.
