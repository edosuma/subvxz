WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.083
[intense music]

00:03.833 --> 00:05.542
(Garibaldi)
'I still don't understand
why we have to lay out'

00:05.625 --> 00:07.083
the welcome mat for these guys.

00:07.167 --> 00:09.583
When the greatest warrior leader
the Minbari ever had

00:09.667 --> 00:11.833
dies suddenly
while on a diplomatic tour

00:11.917 --> 00:15.042
it's natural they'd wanna
honor him on his journey home.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.917
The way they're doing it,
displaying his body

00:17.000 --> 00:18.792
to every Minbari
from the Euphrates Sect

00:18.875 --> 00:22.000
to their home planet,
sounds like war drums to me.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.667
Minbari vessel coming through.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.792
[dramatic music]

00:36.542 --> 00:38.625
A war cruiser.

00:38.708 --> 00:41.500
Never thought
I'd see one of those again.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.917
Mitchell, stay in formation!
It might be a..

00:45.000 --> 00:47.833
Oh, my God!
It's a trap! Mitchell!

00:47.917 --> 00:50.250
(Mitchell)
'I got a clear shot.
I can take him. I can take him.'

00:50.333 --> 00:52.917
- 'Break off!'
- 'I'm hit! Ejecting!'

00:53.000 --> 00:55.292
[Mitchell screams]

00:55.375 --> 00:57.792
Well, they're still
big and ugly.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.917
[music continues]

01:05.083 --> 01:06.958
(man on PA)
'Attention..'

01:07.042 --> 01:09.167
'You can now find
all your culinary needs'

01:09.250 --> 01:12.125
'at Ralph's Kitchen
on level 6.'

01:12.208 --> 01:15.250
'Fresh chocolates are on special
while they last.'

01:15.333 --> 01:17.958
'Please bring
your own folding bags.'

01:20.167 --> 01:21.583
[beeps]

01:21.667 --> 01:23.542
- Ivanova here.
- 'Lieutenant commander.'

01:23.625 --> 01:26.708
- 'The Minbari ship is through.'
- I'm on my way.

01:26.792 --> 01:28.667
Check, please.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.417
[indistinct chatter]

01:34.417 --> 01:36.167
[indistinct chatter]

01:36.250 --> 01:37.500
Yeah, that's good, right there.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.625
(woman on PA)
'...hold the dinner pass'

01:39.708 --> 01:42.125
'in auction in 33118'

01:42.208 --> 01:45.500
'this Saturday at 21 hours
through the scanner.'

01:45.583 --> 01:48.625
'All population
is cordially invited to attend.'

01:48.708 --> 01:51.208
'For information, contact..'

01:51.292 --> 01:54.375
[indistinct chatter]

01:57.083 --> 01:58.375
Hey!

01:58.458 --> 02:00.333
Hey-hey-hey!
Come back here! Thief!

02:00.417 --> 02:03.375
Thief! Stop! Thief! Stop her!

02:03.458 --> 02:05.083
[intense music]

02:05.167 --> 02:07.917
[screeching]

02:08.000 --> 02:10.250
[screams]

02:13.125 --> 02:15.125
- Get Dr. Franklin fast.
- You know this girl?

02:15.208 --> 02:17.667
No. She's just taken
a mind-burst.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.667
She's a telepath.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.708
Commander, we've just finished
the security scan.

02:23.792 --> 02:26.542
The Minbari's coming in
with her gun ports open.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.250
'She's armed for a fight.'

02:28.333 --> 02:31.375
[intense music]

02:36.625 --> 02:40.167
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:40.250 --> 02:43.375
ten years
after the Earth-Minbari War.

02:43.458 --> 02:46.708
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.875
Its goal, to prevent
another war by creating a place

02:49.958 --> 02:51.417
where humans and aliens

02:51.500 --> 02:54.250
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.083
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:57.167 --> 03:02.250
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:02.333 --> 03:06.833
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

03:06.917 --> 03:08.750
of spinning metal

03:08.833 --> 03:11.083
all alone in the night.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.125
It can be a dangerous place

03:14.208 --> 03:17.167
but it's our last, best hope
for peace.

03:17.250 --> 03:21.458
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.792
The year is 2258.

03:23.875 --> 03:27.333
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:27.417 --> 03:30.500
[theme music]

03:57.417 --> 04:00.500
[music continues]

04:05.875 --> 04:08.333
[intense music]

04:09.750 --> 04:12.167
Minbari vessels still closing
with gun ports open.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.667
Recommend we activate
defense grid.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.000
- Just in case.
- Agreed.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.500
This is Babylon control

04:16.583 --> 04:18.333
to Minbari war-cruiser, Ingata.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.500
Your gun ports
are in attack position.

04:20.583 --> 04:24.167
We've activated our
defense system. Please explain.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.750
We are on a peaceful mission,
commander.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.375
Then why are
your gun ports open?

04:28.458 --> 04:31.708
We have no interest
in explaining our ways to you.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.417
[music continues]

04:33.500 --> 04:37.333
I'm sorry there has been
a misunderstanding, commander.

04:37.417 --> 04:39.042
If you will scan the ship

04:39.125 --> 04:41.500
you will find
that the guns are not active.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.292
Confirmed.
No targeting sensors detected.

04:44.375 --> 04:46.500
It's only a symbol to show

04:46.583 --> 04:49.625
they carry the body
of a great warrior leader.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.417
Do you not also have something
in your military traditions

04:52.500 --> 04:55.083
to honor a fallen leader?

04:55.167 --> 04:57.875
Yes, the riderless horse,
the missing-man formation.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.375
It's no more than that.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.833
But while
they are parked alongside

05:01.917 --> 05:03.833
the captain will certainly
comply with your order

05:03.917 --> 05:05.875
'to close the gun ports.'

05:05.958 --> 05:08.000
'Is that satisfactory?'

05:08.083 --> 05:10.333
- Barely.
- Good.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.542
Then if you will excuse me

05:11.625 --> 05:15.125
I must prepare
to meet the cortege.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.500
You'll both join me there,
of course

05:17.583 --> 05:20.167
to honor Branmer's memory

05:20.250 --> 05:21.917
and to welcome the cortege.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.542
We'll be there.

05:23.625 --> 05:26.708
[instrumental music]

05:32.083 --> 05:34.250
Station One,
keep scanning that ship.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.250
If their tracking system so much
as blinks in our direction..

05:37.333 --> 05:38.750
Understood.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.583
[sighs]

05:47.250 --> 05:50.292
[beeping]

05:53.583 --> 05:57.708
Readings are all normal,
except the EEG.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.375
What happened to her?

05:59.458 --> 06:01.667
She took a mind-burst.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.542
She's a telepath, a strong one.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.208
I felt her scream in my mind
when she took the burst.

06:07.292 --> 06:08.750
What do you mean by a burst?

06:08.833 --> 06:10.500
'If you're born
with your psi talent active'

06:10.583 --> 06:13.542
you'll learn early on to block
the noise of other minds.

06:13.625 --> 06:16.750
But sometimes the talent
is latent until it's triggered.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.208
Onset of puberty can do it.

06:18.292 --> 06:20.542
This girl looks about
the right age for that.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.458
So the reaction is the same
as if a deaf person

06:22.542 --> 06:24.750
suddenly heard a rocket engine
screaming in her head?

06:24.833 --> 06:27.250
Exactly, she didn't know
what was happening

06:27.333 --> 06:29.958
and her mind
just ran away and hid.

06:30.042 --> 06:31.750
If her telepathic abilities
just woke up

06:31.833 --> 06:33.542
and the Psi Corps doesn't know
about her yet..

06:33.625 --> 06:36.625
There's got to be some
genetic record somewhere.

06:36.708 --> 06:37.875
As soon as we find out
who she is

06:37.958 --> 06:39.625
I'll arrange
for her transport to Earth.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.292
A Psi Corps rep
can meet her there.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.167
Negative. She was committing
a theft when she went down.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.625
She's under station jurisdiction
until that is dealt with.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.875
- She's not going anywhere.
- You're not being reasonable.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.625
Fine, it's my call,
and I'm making it.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.125
Excuse me,
but until this is resolved

06:52.208 --> 06:55.625
she is still my patient,
and I'm ordering you out.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.167
Both of you.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.875
[instrumental music]

07:08.750 --> 07:10.000
You know, Jeff,
I can't believe you're

07:10.083 --> 07:11.708
really gonna
attend this ceremony.

07:11.792 --> 07:12.917
I mean, this Branmer guy planned

07:13.000 --> 07:14.125
and led the attack on the line.

07:14.208 --> 07:15.500
I know, he commanded

07:15.583 --> 07:17.500
one of the ships
that splashed my team.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.583
But the war is over.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.542
At least that's what
I keep telling myself.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.167
Giving the Minbari this courtesy
is a sign of respect.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.042
It'll help strengthen
the reconciliation

07:26.125 --> 07:28.167
of our two worlds.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.500
Maybe, but if you ask me

07:30.583 --> 07:34.083
this is gonna be
nothing but trouble.

07:34.167 --> 07:37.250
[instrumental music]

07:44.500 --> 07:47.542
[drum beats]

07:51.458 --> 07:54.000
[instrumental music]

07:54.958 --> 07:58.000
[drum beats]

08:04.792 --> 08:06.667
Ambassador Delenn.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.833
Alit Neroon.

08:09.917 --> 08:13.583
I welcome you on behalf
of all Minbari on this station.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.167
It is an unhappy journey
on which you travel.

08:16.250 --> 08:19.542
For the warrior, there is
no other end to the journey.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.750
(Delenn)
'This is Commander Sinclair'

08:21.833 --> 08:23.958
'Lieutenant Commander Ivanova'

08:24.042 --> 08:26.583
and Chief of Security Garibaldi.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.000
The commander
has arranged the place

08:28.083 --> 08:30.792
in which the Shai Alit
may lie in state.

08:30.875 --> 08:35.250
It is a worthy thing to honor
the Shai Alit. Thank you.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.292
And worthy that you would
honor the importance

08:37.375 --> 08:39.625
of this place with his presence.

08:39.708 --> 08:43.583
Mr. Garibaldi and I will escort
you to the area we've set aside.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.250
This way, please.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.750
[instrumental music]

08:55.083 --> 08:57.833
The arrangements are
most satisfactory, commander.

08:57.917 --> 09:00.875
- Simple, but elegant.
- Thank you.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.750
Tell me, who is Alit Neroon?

09:02.833 --> 09:05.292
Branmer's aide
and executive officer.

09:05.375 --> 09:08.292
He served the Shai Alit
for more than 15 years.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.417
I would very much like you
to be present

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
at the viewing of
the Shai Alit's body tomorrow.

09:14.583 --> 09:18.000
- Of course.
- I sense some reluctance.

09:18.083 --> 09:21.250
Branmer was a hard, canny enemy.
It's difficult to forget that.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.792
It is because
he was such a great warrior

09:23.875 --> 09:26.875
his body is being displayed
in this way.

09:26.958 --> 09:30.458
- It's not traditional?
- It is most unusual.

09:30.542 --> 09:34.125
The Star Riders,
his clan insisted on it.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.042
You don't like it, do you?

09:37.375 --> 09:40.542
My preferences were not
under discussion, commander.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.750
[beeping]

09:44.833 --> 09:46.250
[groaning]

09:47.917 --> 09:50.875
- How's she doing?
- Well, she's coming around.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.625
How do you feel?

09:55.250 --> 09:57.125
[whooshing]

09:57.208 --> 09:59.458
[echoes]
Gently, Alisa. Calm down.

09:59.542 --> 10:03.000
Do as I say and block out
the voices inside your head.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.458
Now relax.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.792
Imagine a wall inside your mind
behind your eyes.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.000
Build it, brick by brick.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.750
- I can't!
- Yes, you can! Focus!

10:11.833 --> 10:13.125
See the wall.

10:13.208 --> 10:15.917
[echoes]
The sounds go away
as the wall goes higher.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.667
You'll only hear
what you wanna hear.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.333
Yes, like that.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.875
Just like that.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.208
It's better.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.375
So where did you get her name?

10:35.458 --> 10:36.792
She can't control her talent.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.792
She's broadcasting
every thought in her head.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.208
Her name is Alisa Beldon.

10:40.292 --> 10:42.417
She came to the station with
her father looking for work.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
Computer, access Beldon, Alisa.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.875
(computer)
'Commencing search. File found.'

10:46.958 --> 10:49.583
Here it is. Came here
two years ago with her father.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.333
Both Earthborn. She was 12.

10:52.417 --> 10:55.250
'Mother's death recorded
on Earth six years prior.'

10:55.333 --> 10:57.042
No further information.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.917
Her father died last year.
An accident.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.875
She's been living on her own
in Downbelow ever since.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.042
Am I under arrest?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.500
I had to eat.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.917
You don't stay alive unless
you got credits to pay with.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.417
You don't have
to feel bad about it.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.250
'I'm used to doing for myself.'

11:19.333 --> 11:21.750
My mom died young, too,
same as yours.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.417
Stop that!

11:23.500 --> 11:25.583
What's the matter?

11:25.667 --> 11:26.792
Alisa, you must never read

11:26.875 --> 11:28.667
someone's mind
without permission.

11:28.750 --> 11:31.000
But it was so plain.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.458
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean anything.

11:33.542 --> 11:36.833
As I said, she needs
to be properly trained.

11:36.917 --> 11:38.250
The sooner you're with
the Psi Corps, the better

11:38.333 --> 11:40.167
you'll be able to deal
with this gift of yours.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.083
(Ivanova)
'We still haven't dealt
with the charges against her.'

11:42.167 --> 11:44.958
Let's take care of one crisis
at a time, shall we?

11:45.042 --> 11:46.542
Keep me informed
of her condition.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.417
Lieutenant commander

11:48.500 --> 11:49.542
is there any particular reason

11:49.625 --> 11:51.625
why you're interested
in this case?

11:51.708 --> 11:53.292
Yes.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.125
She's not leaving here,
Ms. Winters

11:55.208 --> 11:57.458
not as long as I have anything
to say about it.

12:01.292 --> 12:04.375
[instrumental music]

12:05.750 --> 12:08.125
Station your people
at all the access ports.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.917
- And make sure they check--
- Commander!

12:11.000 --> 12:14.458
Alit, I trust you've found
everything to your satisfaction.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.125
There are procedures
that must be followed

12:16.208 --> 12:18.333
while the Shai Alit's body
lies in state.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.500
You will keep all other races,
especially humans

12:21.583 --> 12:25.042
away from the area until
the viewing ceremony begins.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.833
Uh, don't worry,
my security team will--

12:26.917 --> 12:30.208
No! No human security.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.875
'I have arranged
for Minbari guards'

12:31.958 --> 12:33.792
'on the Shai Alit's body
during the night.'

12:33.875 --> 12:35.083
Neither you nor any of your

12:35.167 --> 12:36.667
officers will interfere
with them.

12:36.750 --> 12:37.667
Oh, now just a minute--

12:37.750 --> 12:40.042
Mr. Garibaldi, diplomacy.

12:40.125 --> 12:43.500
- Anything else you'd like?
- That will suffice for now.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.042
(Neroon)
These are my requirements,
commander.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.833
This is my station.
I don't take orders here.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.458
Impetuous.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.917
Is this how you reacted
on the line, commander?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.250
- This isn't the line.
- No.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.500
- We were in control there.
- How would you like to--

12:58.583 --> 13:02.000
It's been my experience
that discussions of old battles

13:02.083 --> 13:04.333
only interest historians.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.625
What do you think, commander?

13:08.708 --> 13:12.750
I think...
I have a station to run.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.917
Now if you'll excuse us..

13:23.333 --> 13:25.000
Diplomacy, commander?

13:27.750 --> 13:29.000
[sighs]

13:29.083 --> 13:32.125
[instrumental music]

13:38.625 --> 13:41.667
[drum beats]

13:45.417 --> 13:47.958
[instrumental music]

13:48.875 --> 13:51.917
[drum beats]

14:05.667 --> 14:08.542
This was the greatest of us.

14:08.625 --> 14:12.458
Warrior, leader

14:12.542 --> 14:14.625
the hero of the line!

14:16.167 --> 14:20.542
He fought with honor, bravery

14:20.625 --> 14:23.083
and with vision.

14:23.167 --> 14:27.292
Now he belongs to the ages.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.333
[instrumental music]

14:51.875 --> 14:54.417
[intense music]

14:55.333 --> 14:57.708
Where is the Shai Alit?

14:58.667 --> 14:59.833
What?

15:01.375 --> 15:04.458
[music continues]

15:11.542 --> 15:15.042
Where is the Shai Alit's body?

15:15.125 --> 15:16.625
That's what
we're gonna find out.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.625
I've launched
a full-scale investigation.

15:18.708 --> 15:22.083
This is a grave offense,
commander. Unforgivable.

15:22.167 --> 15:25.583
Minbari warriors are heedless
of their own lives in battle

15:25.667 --> 15:27.833
'but the body of a warrior
must be treated'

15:27.917 --> 15:29.417
'with extreme reverence.'

15:29.500 --> 15:32.208
Branmer's death
was a great sorrow to us.

15:32.292 --> 15:34.125
To lose the vessel of his soul

15:34.208 --> 15:37.208
will bring
his clan's fury upon you.

15:37.292 --> 15:39.000
Are you threatening
to make war over this?

15:39.083 --> 15:40.500
That is how the last one started

15:40.583 --> 15:41.958
with the murder of Dukhat!

15:42.042 --> 15:43.250
That was a tragic accident.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.708
And if this
is another such accident--

15:45.792 --> 15:47.750
If I may

15:47.833 --> 15:50.167
no matter how great the loss

15:50.250 --> 15:52.667
it is not our way
to let a single clan

15:52.750 --> 15:55.125
dictate Minbari policy.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.833
(Delenn)
'We will appreciate
your best efforts'

15:58.917 --> 16:02.167
to solve this mystery,
commander.

16:02.250 --> 16:05.667
I suggest we allow them to get
on with their investigation.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.292
I've got a few things
to tend to.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.583
Fun, fun, fun.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.208
Garibaldi was right.

16:24.292 --> 16:26.708
He said
this was going to be trouble.

16:26.792 --> 16:27.917
There's nothing more annoying

16:28.000 --> 16:29.417
than Mr. Garibaldi
when he's right.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.875
Mm.

16:30.958 --> 16:33.500
If you've got a moment
for another matter, commander

16:33.583 --> 16:35.542
a personal matter?

16:35.625 --> 16:38.208
We found a young girl,
an orphan.

16:38.292 --> 16:40.333
'She's been living
in Downbelow.'

16:40.417 --> 16:42.958
And it turns out
she's a telepath.

16:43.042 --> 16:44.417
Now Ms. Winters
wants to send her

16:44.500 --> 16:46.625
to the Psi Corps immediately.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.917
I believe she should have
a choice in what happens to her.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.750
I agree. But does she have
any other choice?

16:53.750 --> 16:55.208
Possibly.

16:55.292 --> 16:56.875
If we can keep her
under our jurisdiction

16:56.958 --> 16:59.167
long enough for us to find it.

16:59.250 --> 17:03.167
Commander, what happened before

17:03.250 --> 17:04.542
my mother..

17:05.792 --> 17:07.375
...I just can't let this slide.

17:07.458 --> 17:10.917
I know.
Do what you think is right.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.125
I'll back your play.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.750
Yes, sir.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.417
Thank you.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.583
[instrumental music]

17:32.542 --> 17:35.792
Why would anyone wanna take
Branmer's body

17:35.875 --> 17:37.542
if he was that highly regarded?

17:37.625 --> 17:40.542
Minbari
have high regard for him.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.917
As for others..

17:43.000 --> 17:45.958
How did you respond when
I first spoke of this to you?

17:46.042 --> 17:47.292
Alright.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.375
Humans who fought Branmer
have no love for him.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.500
There are elements on Earth
who feel that way.

17:53.583 --> 17:54.917
The Home Guard for one.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.250
But if they were responsible
for this

17:56.333 --> 17:58.292
they would've broadcast the news
right away.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.917
But no one's come forth
to claim credit

18:00.000 --> 18:02.833
for taking
this great general's body.

18:02.917 --> 18:07.042
Great general, yes.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.500
The last thing he wanted to be.

18:11.250 --> 18:15.833
Before he became a warrior
of the Star Riders clan

18:15.917 --> 18:19.667
Branmer was a high priest
of the religious caste.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.250
The Holy War against Earth

18:21.333 --> 18:24.458
forced him
to become a war leader.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.542
He was a brilliant tactician

18:26.625 --> 18:29.500
and he believed
in the rightness of the war.

18:29.583 --> 18:33.292
He fought because it was
a matter of conscience

18:33.375 --> 18:36.292
but he never ceased
to be a priest in his heart.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.167
I've heard
it was the religious caste

18:38.250 --> 18:39.708
who issued the surrender order.

18:39.792 --> 18:42.875
- 'Branmer agreed?'
- He obeyed.

18:42.958 --> 18:46.000
But there are still warriors
who resented.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.542
One of the war leaders, Sinavel,
committed suicide

18:49.625 --> 18:51.542
rather than
give the order to surrender.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.542
And Neroon?

18:53.625 --> 18:56.375
Neroon is also a Star Rider.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.958
He would have died for Branmer.

18:59.042 --> 19:00.208
If Branmer gave an order

19:00.292 --> 19:02.375
he would follow it
without question.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.292
But now with Branmer gone

19:04.375 --> 19:07.208
I get the feeling
Neroon's spoiling for a rematch.

19:07.292 --> 19:09.083
[sighs]

19:09.167 --> 19:13.042
We will see what we will see.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.917
How can you even think
that we might have had

19:18.000 --> 19:19.792
something to do
with the disappearance?

19:19.875 --> 19:23.458
- Why? Why should we want it?
- Well, let's see.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.375
Ransom?
Embarrassment for the Minbari?

19:25.458 --> 19:27.542
Blackening
Babylon 5's reputation?

19:27.625 --> 19:30.250
A thing like that could help
your career back home.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.833
Well, I can go on if you want.

19:31.917 --> 19:33.625
I'm sure you could,
Mr. Garibaldi

19:33.708 --> 19:35.333
but I'm not interested.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.917
The Narn Regime has accomplished
many things in its glorious past

19:39.000 --> 19:41.750
but body-snatching
isn't one of them.

19:41.833 --> 19:44.083
Why don't you ask
in the Alien Sector?

19:44.167 --> 19:45.542
I'm sure
you could find someone there

19:45.625 --> 19:47.958
with an interest in dead bodies.

19:49.208 --> 19:52.208
Oh, no, not the carrion eaters.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.750
[chuckles]
Bon appetit.

19:54.833 --> 19:57.208
[instrumental music]

19:58.208 --> 19:59.792
I appreciate the clothes.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.917
The other ones
were getting pretty ripe.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.208
We should get you
some more outfits

20:03.292 --> 20:04.708
before your trip back to Earth.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.250
And The Psi Corps pays
for all this?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.875
Of course,
the Corps takes care of its own.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.625
Why don't you tell her
what else the Psi Corps does

20:10.708 --> 20:12.250
when it takes care of someone?

20:12.333 --> 20:13.458
Lieutenant commander,
this really

20:13.542 --> 20:14.875
isn't any of your concern.

20:14.958 --> 20:16.958
Oh, yes, it is,
and you know why it is.

20:17.042 --> 20:18.583
Now why don't you let me
talk to her for a while

20:18.667 --> 20:21.000
unless you're afraid
to let her hear another side?

20:30.333 --> 20:32.000
Psi Corps doesn't sound so bad.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.875
'I don't understand
what you have against them.'

20:33.958 --> 20:35.292
Did she tell you
what the Psi Corp does

20:35.375 --> 20:37.583
to telepaths
who don't wanna join them?

20:37.667 --> 20:39.625
- No.
- 'Let me tell you a story.'

20:39.708 --> 20:41.958
It's all about a woman
who fell in love, got married

20:42.042 --> 20:44.292
had children. It was supposed
to be a simple dream.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.625
Just one problem,
she was a telepath.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.417
She managed to keep that fact
from the Psi Corps

20:49.500 --> 20:50.625
till she was 35.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.333
By then
she had two young children.

20:52.417 --> 20:56.333
The Corps told her to come
with them or go to prison.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.292
But she loved her husband
and her children

20:58.375 --> 21:00.500
'and she refused to leave them.'

21:00.583 --> 21:03.042
There was only one way they
would let her stay with them.

21:07.375 --> 21:11.167
Every week, for ten years
they injected her with drugs

21:11.250 --> 21:13.833
that suppressed
her telepathic talents.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.792
'Every day she died a little'

21:16.875 --> 21:21.000
until she finally ended it
by taking her own life.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.250
That was your mother.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.208
That's the image I saw
in your mind the other day.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.542
I have no love
for the Psi Corps, Alisa.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.917
And you have every right to know
everything about them

21:37.000 --> 21:39.167
before you decide to join them.

21:40.875 --> 21:45.583
Yeah, but I don't have
much of a choice here, do I?

21:45.667 --> 21:49.375
Well, I'm investigating
your options.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.583
There may be
more than you think.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.667
Alisa..

21:59.625 --> 22:01.750
...can I have my link, please?

22:04.375 --> 22:07.875
Just keeping in practice,
in case.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.708
Mr. Garibaldi,
what have you discovered?

22:19.792 --> 22:21.833
Does the term "Not much"
mean anything to you?

22:21.917 --> 22:23.875
I was promised
a complete investigation.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.208
You're getting it.

22:25.292 --> 22:27.042
I thought there might be
something with the Llort.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.500
They're pack rats, they collect
all sorts of souvenirs

22:29.583 --> 22:30.917
for the pure sake
of collecting them.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.542
But not bodies.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.417
- There's one other possibi--
- Chief!

22:36.500 --> 22:37.833
Better take a look at this.

22:37.917 --> 22:40.000
I found that outside
the Pak'ma'ra's quarters.

22:40.083 --> 22:43.000
This is a piece
of Branmer's burial robe.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.792
What are these Pak'ma'ra?

22:45.875 --> 22:47.542
Carrion eaters.

22:51.667 --> 22:55.167
This is nothing to me.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.125
It was found on the deck
directly outside these quarters.

22:58.208 --> 23:01.667
[grunts]
I'm not responsible

23:01.750 --> 23:04.125
for the cleanliness
of your decks.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.292
This material
is from the burial robes

23:06.375 --> 23:08.500
of an esteemed Minbari leader.

23:08.583 --> 23:11.583
- His body's been stolen.
- And so?

23:11.667 --> 23:14.833
Where is the body?
What did you do with it?

23:14.917 --> 23:16.917
Answer the question
as a courtesy

23:17.000 --> 23:18.875
to our Minbari friends.

23:20.167 --> 23:22.250
I have heard nothing!

23:22.333 --> 23:23.833
Then I'm afraid
I have no choice.

23:23.917 --> 23:26.083
I'll have to make
a deeper inquiry.

23:26.167 --> 23:28.000
A deeper inquiry?

23:28.083 --> 23:29.625
I'm going to have to insist
that you all

23:29.708 --> 23:31.125
have your stomachs pumped.

23:31.208 --> 23:34.250
[growling]

23:40.583 --> 23:42.042
The house, of course,
would be decorated

23:42.125 --> 23:43.667
entirely to your taste

23:43.750 --> 23:47.000
in Earth style or Narnish,
if you prefer.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.833
You said something
about clothing and jewelry.

23:49.917 --> 23:52.125
Ah, yes, there will be
a substantial credit allowance

23:52.208 --> 23:54.042
for clothing
and other personal adornment

23:54.125 --> 23:56.750
in addition
to your fee for services.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.750
We are prepared
to be extremely generous.

23:59.833 --> 24:02.250
And what services
is she supposed to render?

24:02.333 --> 24:04.208
I was making an offer to Alisa

24:04.292 --> 24:06.042
not to you,
lieutenant commander.

24:06.125 --> 24:07.667
What services?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.875
So simple and yet so rewarding.

24:09.958 --> 24:12.542
All we ask is a small sample
of blood and tissue

24:12.625 --> 24:15.167
every now and then,
say, twice a month.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.667
You know, we are the only race
without telepaths.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.333
You would become the mother,
genetically speaking

24:20.417 --> 24:22.875
of an entire breed
of Narn telepaths.

24:22.958 --> 24:25.542
- I don't believe this.
- Mm. Welcome to the club.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.958
Didn't G'Kar try and talk

24:27.042 --> 24:29.375
our last telepath
into something like this?

24:29.458 --> 24:31.208
'You're trying to succeed
where he failed?'

24:31.292 --> 24:33.917
I'd have to live
on the Narn home-world.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.375
But it sounds interesting.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.542
You'd probably be
the only human there.

24:38.625 --> 24:39.583
- Yeah.
- Ah.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.708
But we are prepared
to pay so well

24:41.792 --> 24:43.708
for the privilege
of entertaining her.

24:43.792 --> 24:46.000
I'd really like to see it.

24:46.083 --> 24:48.667
I almost can if I concen..

24:49.458 --> 24:52.458
[intense music]

24:56.125 --> 24:57.583
I'll talk to you later.

24:57.667 --> 25:01.083
- Alisa?
- I have to lie down.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.917
I hope that isn't a sign
of some frailty in her.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.333
Why don't you check her teeth
while you're at it?

25:06.417 --> 25:07.625
Think that's a good idea?

25:07.708 --> 25:10.042
I suggest you leave, Na'Toth,
promptly.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.292
You've made your offer.

25:11.375 --> 25:14.083
Tell her
I expect her answer soon.

25:14.167 --> 25:16.167
Good idea about the teeth.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.417
- What happened?
- I peeked into her mind.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.208
I know
I'm not supposed to, but--

25:24.292 --> 25:26.125
What was it like in there?

25:27.250 --> 25:29.125
Cold!

25:29.208 --> 25:31.083
[sobs]
Ugly.

25:31.167 --> 25:33.250
Alien!

25:33.333 --> 25:35.875
It's not like
looking into a human mind.

25:35.958 --> 25:39.167
It felt like I was falling
into something terrible.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.917
Look, you-you might wanna
remember that

25:43.000 --> 25:45.167
when you consider their offer.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.500
Mitch, get back to central,
tell 'em to narrow the search.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.625
Don, you and Justin,
check Green 2.

25:52.708 --> 25:54.500
Doc, just coming to see you.
Any results on those tests?

25:54.583 --> 25:56.750
Yeah, I just got 'em back
from the lab.

25:56.833 --> 25:59.708
Next time you can do the stomach
pumping of the Pak'ma'ra.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.042
Had to burn two lab coats.

26:01.125 --> 26:03.208
Forget ever getting
the smell out of them.

26:03.292 --> 26:04.792
- You didn't find anything?
- No, no.

26:04.875 --> 26:06.667
The Carrion eaters,
they ate something, definitely

26:06.750 --> 26:08.083
just not Minbari.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.333
And you sure
you tested all of them?

26:09.417 --> 26:10.792
Absolutely.

26:10.875 --> 26:13.458
So where do you look now,
Mr. Garibaldi?

26:13.542 --> 26:15.583
In the beams and rafters,
between hulls.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.333
It's the only place left.

26:17.417 --> 26:19.458
- Thanks for your help.
- Alright.

26:19.542 --> 26:23.125
Oh, by the way, you know
what they say Narn tastes like?

26:23.208 --> 26:24.542
Yeah, chicken.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.000
Man, I really need a vacation.

26:29.458 --> 26:32.167
(Neroon)
'Your man is useless!'

26:32.250 --> 26:34.833
Stomach contents!

26:34.917 --> 26:36.583
Branmer's body must be found.

26:36.667 --> 26:38.958
If your man, Garibaldi,
cannot handle the assignment

26:39.042 --> 26:41.208
he must be replaced
by someone who can!

26:41.292 --> 26:43.125
Mr. Garibaldi will do his job.

26:43.208 --> 26:46.417
A search of all public areas and
quarters had to be done first.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.333
'Now they're looking at
the station structure itself.'

26:48.417 --> 26:50.167
If security has to take
this place apart

26:50.250 --> 26:51.917
and put it back together again,
they will.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
If Mr. Garibaldi
fails in his search

26:54.083 --> 26:57.500
I may find it necessary
to have my ship assume the job

26:57.583 --> 26:59.708
of taking this station apart!

26:59.792 --> 27:01.292
[intense music]

27:01.375 --> 27:03.167
I don't take kindly to threats,
Alit.

27:03.250 --> 27:06.250
I do not make threats,
commander.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.375
[intense music]

27:12.458 --> 27:14.167
(Ivanova)
'You're definitely a high P-10.'

27:14.250 --> 27:17.417
I bet Na'Toth might up her bid
if she saw those test results.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.333
I thought you didn't like
contact with the Narn mind.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.167
(Alisa)
'I don't have to go
into their minds.'

27:21.250 --> 27:23.708
I'd just have to give them the
biogenetic samples they want.

27:23.792 --> 27:26.667
I can supply you with history
modules on the Narn Regime.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.375
Take a good look
at their home-world, Alisa.

27:29.458 --> 27:33.000
The Centauri occupation left
it bleak, barren, almost dead.

27:33.083 --> 27:36.458
The Narns are interested only
in conquering other races now.

27:36.542 --> 27:37.875
They make slaves
of their victims.

27:37.958 --> 27:39.750
And despite Na'Toth's claims

27:39.833 --> 27:42.167
'they'll probably
try and make one of you as well'

27:42.250 --> 27:43.583
a little like the Psi Corps.

27:43.667 --> 27:44.542
Lieutenant commander

27:44.625 --> 27:45.833
granted you have your problems

27:45.917 --> 27:46.875
with the Psi Corps

27:46.958 --> 27:48.417
and I sympathize
with your feelings

27:48.500 --> 27:50.417
but I won't have you
poisoning her with them.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.125
Like the facts about the lives
they've ruined?

27:52.208 --> 27:54.292
- The people they've destroyed?
- And the good they've done.

27:54.375 --> 27:56.083
Just because
your mother didn't cooperate.

27:56.167 --> 27:58.417
- Like your friend Ironheart?
- You leave him out of this.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.667
Don't you dare bring him
into this--

27:59.750 --> 28:02.667
Stop it! Stop it, both of you!

28:02.750 --> 28:04.458
'You keep arguing
over what you want!'

28:04.542 --> 28:06.292
You don't care
about what I want.

28:06.375 --> 28:08.083
You don't even ask!

28:10.583 --> 28:12.875
Alright, Alisa,
what do you want?

28:12.958 --> 28:14.375
[sighs]

28:14.458 --> 28:17.500
To know the truth
about all my choices.

28:17.583 --> 28:18.792
Is that all of it?

28:18.875 --> 28:21.250
Narn, Psi Corps, the drugs?

28:23.292 --> 28:24.958
No.

28:25.042 --> 28:27.917
There's one more possibility
you should consider.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.625
[beeping]

28:31.667 --> 28:32.708
Come.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.792
Thank you for taking the time
to see us, ambassador.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.458
It is my pleasure.

28:39.083 --> 28:42.958
So, Alisa, you wish to know
about Minbari telepaths?

28:43.042 --> 28:44.708
I just wanna see all the cards
on the table

28:44.792 --> 28:46.292
before I make a bet.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.250
I was not aware
there was a game involved.

28:48.333 --> 28:51.833
It's just an expression
of speech, ambassador.

28:51.917 --> 28:53.833
Well, perhaps we should start

28:53.917 --> 28:56.958
with some
general information first.

28:57.042 --> 29:00.250
For the Minbari, psi ability
is considered a gift.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.625
Therefore, the use of it
is extended as a service

29:02.708 --> 29:04.000
to those who have need of it.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.500
They're not paid?

29:05.583 --> 29:07.958
(Delenn)
'Only with a high regard
of our people.'

29:08.042 --> 29:11.042
It is not a job,
it is a calling.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.958
It's enough for them
to be of service.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.833
Then how do they live?

29:14.917 --> 29:17.667
'Those who wish to help others,
to serve others'

29:17.750 --> 29:20.292
are greatly respected
within our culture.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.250
They are encouraged
and helped in their goal

29:22.333 --> 29:24.500
by making sure
that their needs are met.

29:24.583 --> 29:26.042
'They're clothed and fed'

29:26.125 --> 29:28.583
and left alone to do
what they're called to do.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.792
It is a small price to pay

29:29.875 --> 29:32.292
for something
that benefits many.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.875
I looked into a Narn mind today.
It wasn't pretty.

29:34.958 --> 29:37.167
Apparently, Narnuan minds
can cause a problem

29:37.250 --> 29:38.500
for someone who isn't trained.

29:38.583 --> 29:41.167
Yes, I have heard this.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.542
We do not all
think the same way. We..

29:47.125 --> 29:49.667
[intense music]

29:50.667 --> 29:53.208
[zapping]

30:00.000 --> 30:01.875
I, uh, I think we should go.

30:01.958 --> 30:04.750
- Don't you need some more time?
- No, I got a clear picture.

30:04.833 --> 30:06.208
Thank you.

30:14.458 --> 30:18.500
Is there something going on
around here about a dead body?

30:18.583 --> 30:20.542
Yes. Why?

30:20.625 --> 30:23.833
[sighs]
I saw something about the body.

30:23.917 --> 30:26.625
I know what happened to it.

30:26.708 --> 30:29.000
Mr. Garibaldi,
I need to see you immediately.

30:30.667 --> 30:33.708
[intense music]

30:43.917 --> 30:45.458
[grunts]

30:47.500 --> 30:50.542
[grunting]

30:54.125 --> 30:57.125
[groaning]

31:03.958 --> 31:05.708
[groans]

31:08.333 --> 31:09.583
Lights.

31:11.625 --> 31:14.167
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

31:14.250 --> 31:16.792
Everywhere has been searched
but here

31:16.875 --> 31:19.125
where no one would dare to go.

31:19.208 --> 31:20.583
Wrong.

31:22.792 --> 31:24.167
I searched these quarters
personally

31:24.250 --> 31:26.042
with Ambassador Delenn
observing.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.833
I wanted to make sure
everything was on the up and up

31:27.917 --> 31:29.250
'and nobody was sneaking around'

31:29.333 --> 31:31.250
trying to pull a fast one.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.458
You might wanna try it sometime.

31:33.542 --> 31:35.958
Escort the Alit
back to his quarters.

31:36.042 --> 31:39.000
We'll continue the search
without his help.

31:39.083 --> 31:40.417
Will do.

31:44.417 --> 31:46.708
I brought someone to see you.
Alisa Beldon.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.958
I think you better talk to her,
Jeff.

31:53.167 --> 31:55.542
Ms. Beldon?

31:55.625 --> 31:59.833
Commander, there's something
you have to know.

31:59.917 --> 32:03.208
When I was talking
to Ambassador Delenn

32:03.292 --> 32:06.667
I looked inside her head

32:06.750 --> 32:08.958
and I saw something.

32:09.042 --> 32:12.625
She covered it up real quick,
but, commander

32:12.708 --> 32:15.250
she knows
who took that Minbari body

32:15.333 --> 32:17.458
'and she knows where it is.'

32:27.417 --> 32:29.500
[intense music]

32:29.583 --> 32:32.500
- Ambassador.
- Good evening, commander.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.833
Mr. Garibaldi.

32:33.917 --> 32:35.958
Shipping something home,
ambassador?

32:36.042 --> 32:38.333
Just some personal possessions.

32:45.958 --> 32:47.833
I think we need to talk.

33:04.042 --> 33:05.708
Quite a trick.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.000
Stealing Branmer's body
and cremating it

33:08.083 --> 33:10.292
without anyone noticing it.

33:10.375 --> 33:11.917
Why?

33:12.000 --> 33:15.042
As a member
of the religious caste

33:15.125 --> 33:18.083
I felt an obligation to Branmer.

33:18.167 --> 33:22.208
'As I told you,
he was a reluctant hero.'

33:22.292 --> 33:24.083
He only became a war leader

33:24.167 --> 33:25.542
because he felt it was necessary

33:25.625 --> 33:27.417
for the sake
of the Minbari people.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.583
And your obligation to him?

33:29.667 --> 33:32.708
A long, close friendship.

33:34.292 --> 33:36.667
He told me
that when he was called

33:36.750 --> 33:39.250
he wanted only a simple funeral.

33:39.333 --> 33:43.042
He did not want to be
a monument to war.

33:43.125 --> 33:46.250
Neroon and his Star Riders
have subverted his wishes

33:46.333 --> 33:49.125
with this display of his body.

33:49.208 --> 33:52.042
I decided to carry out
Branmer's wishes.

33:53.208 --> 33:56.083
His ashes are to be sent home.

33:56.167 --> 34:00.000
They will be scattered in space
near our world.

34:01.583 --> 34:04.625
Unfortunately,
you and Mr. Garibaldi

34:04.708 --> 34:06.542
have put that plan in jeopardy.

34:06.625 --> 34:09.042
How could this have any more
jeopardy than it does now?

34:09.125 --> 34:11.042
Neroon and his bunch are ready
to start the whole war

34:11.125 --> 34:12.375
over again
because of this thing.

34:12.458 --> 34:14.458
I believe
I could have explained it

34:14.542 --> 34:16.958
as a true religious mystery.

34:17.042 --> 34:18.917
The transformation
of Branmer's body

34:19.000 --> 34:22.708
so that he could take his place
with the gods. But now..

34:22.792 --> 34:25.792
Delenn, Neroon wants an answer.
You have it.

34:25.875 --> 34:28.583
What am I supposed to do?
Hide the facts?

34:28.667 --> 34:30.875
You've put us
in a difficult situation.

34:30.958 --> 34:34.458
It is more difficult
than you suspect.

34:34.542 --> 34:35.833
You see

34:35.917 --> 34:39.250
a rift between the religious
and warrior castes

34:39.333 --> 34:42.417
began when our warriors
were ordered to surrender.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.333
If what happened to the body

34:46.417 --> 34:49.500
were to become general knowledge

34:49.583 --> 34:51.750
it would further that rift.

34:51.833 --> 34:55.833
Great. Just one question,
what about Neroon?

34:55.917 --> 34:57.917
I promised we'd tell him
what happened.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.333
Then we will do so.

35:00.417 --> 35:04.250
If you will honor my situation,
I will honor yours.

35:05.875 --> 35:09.042
It is regrettable,
but I see no choice.

35:09.125 --> 35:11.833
We will tell him the truth

35:11.917 --> 35:13.750
but I will tell him my way.

35:13.833 --> 35:16.917
[instrumental music]

35:20.500 --> 35:23.875
You had no right
to touch the Shai Alit's body!

35:23.958 --> 35:25.958
He was warrior caste
by right of his father!

35:26.042 --> 35:28.500
And religious caste
by right of his mother!

35:28.583 --> 35:30.708
You know which takes precedence.

35:30.792 --> 35:33.875
Star Riders will protest this.
I will lead the fight myself.

35:33.958 --> 35:36.208
You will do nothing!

35:36.292 --> 35:38.542
You ignored his request
to be cremated

35:38.625 --> 35:41.292
and have his ashes
scattered in space.

35:41.375 --> 35:43.667
You disobeyed
not only your own war leader

35:43.750 --> 35:45.917
but one of the greatest
of our religious caste.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.625
You showed great disrespect.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.583
You had to display
the great warrior's body!

35:51.667 --> 35:53.542
You had to have
your military spectacle!

35:53.625 --> 35:55.708
It stops here..

35:58.458 --> 36:02.042
...or the Star Riders
will be destroyed

36:02.125 --> 36:05.542
dishonored by your actions.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.542
Do you speak for yourself?

36:09.625 --> 36:13.625
I speak
for the entire Grey Council.

36:13.708 --> 36:15.750
I'd hoped to avoid
this conversation

36:15.833 --> 36:17.917
but your insistence
on an investigation

36:18.000 --> 36:19.750
has left me no choice.

36:19.833 --> 36:23.333
You will support my statement
that his body was transformed.

36:23.417 --> 36:27.458
That is a direct order
from the Grey Council.

36:27.542 --> 36:29.583
You will obey it

36:29.667 --> 36:32.917
as you did our order
to end the war.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.625
Do you understand?

36:38.167 --> 36:42.583
Yes, I understand, Satai Delenn.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.542
Is there anything else
you want of me?

36:45.625 --> 36:49.250
You will apologize
to Commander Sinclair

36:49.333 --> 36:52.167
privately, for your behavior.

36:56.458 --> 37:00.375
I will see to it
that you and the Star Riders

37:00.458 --> 37:03.250
will not be punished or shamed

37:03.333 --> 37:05.583
for your honoring
of the Shai Alit.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.750
Yes, Satai Delenn.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.208
There was no cause
for me to attack you, commander.

37:19.292 --> 37:22.708
Even less cause
for me to threaten this station.

37:22.792 --> 37:25.917
I am ashamed to admit that
my feelings for the Shai Alit

37:26.000 --> 37:28.667
led me to act improperly.

37:28.750 --> 37:32.458
There is no shame in wanting
to honor him, Alit Neroon.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.167
I fought on the line
against Branmer.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.375
I saw his valor and leadership
firsthand.

37:39.667 --> 37:42.542
Because his body
disappeared here

37:42.625 --> 37:45.042
I feel some responsibility

37:45.125 --> 37:47.875
toward the Minbari people.

37:47.958 --> 37:52.250
There is no higher testimony
to a warrior's courage and skill

37:52.333 --> 37:54.708
than praise from his enemy.

37:54.792 --> 37:57.625
I would like to send
that message to your home-world

37:57.708 --> 38:02.458
in a personal message,
a testimony to the Shai Alit.

38:02.542 --> 38:06.208
You will do this
as an Earth force officer?

38:06.292 --> 38:08.792
And as commander of Babylon 5.

38:09.833 --> 38:11.917
That is a great kindness.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.417
We've fought long enough.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.375
Maybe it's time we started
talking with one another.

38:19.458 --> 38:22.333
Branmer's life was more
significant than his battles.

38:22.417 --> 38:26.042
Let the warrior caste
praise his courage in war

38:26.125 --> 38:30.125
and let the rest praise him
for what he truly was

38:30.208 --> 38:32.250
a man of peace.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.917
You talk like a Minbari,
commander.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.125
Perhaps there was
some small wisdom

38:38.208 --> 38:41.042
in letting all species survive.

38:41.125 --> 38:43.542
We like to think so.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.708
Until another day, then.

38:56.708 --> 39:00.417
I thought you'd be seeing
Neroon's cruiser off.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.875
- I've seen cruisers before.
- Me, too.

39:07.167 --> 39:10.250
There is someone on this station
who interests me.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.333
Oh.

39:13.333 --> 39:18.292
Alisa Beldon has a most unusual
psi quality for a human.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.833
So I'm told.

39:20.917 --> 39:22.792
She impressed me greatly.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.833
But when she touched my mind

39:24.917 --> 39:28.250
I detected some confusion in her
about her future.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.125
She doesn't seem to care
for either of the opportunities

39:31.208 --> 39:33.875
being offered by Earth or Narn.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.500
And?

39:38.708 --> 39:40.500
Commander?

39:40.583 --> 39:43.042
Do you think Talia and Ivanova
would be really teed off

39:43.125 --> 39:45.167
if I decided
to go with the Minbari?

39:45.250 --> 39:48.417
In order, yes and no.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.750
I don't need to be a telepath
to figure that one out.

39:50.833 --> 39:52.375
(Delenn)
'Alisa could become
an instrument'

39:52.458 --> 39:55.917
of great communication
between humans and Minbari.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.625
We suffer a lack there,
as you know, commander.

40:00.708 --> 40:03.792
The future
in exchange for the past.

40:03.875 --> 40:06.000
I think that's very workable.

40:11.667 --> 40:14.167
[instrumental music]

40:16.542 --> 40:19.083
I wanted to thank you again
for helping me.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.333
- You made your own decision.
- You showed me the choices.

40:22.417 --> 40:25.375
This is best.
I'm used to being on my own.

40:25.458 --> 40:27.208
Psi Corps
wouldn't have worked for me.

40:27.292 --> 40:31.875
And the Narns, uh-uh,
even though the price was right.

40:31.958 --> 40:33.667
There's no price high enough
to compensate

40:33.750 --> 40:36.792
for being surrounded by Narns.

40:36.875 --> 40:39.833
I just thought I'd stop by
and wish you well.

40:39.917 --> 40:41.458
I don't agree with your decision

40:41.542 --> 40:42.833
but the commander's right.

40:42.917 --> 40:45.500
You could be a big help
with the Minbari.

40:45.583 --> 40:47.500
And who knows, maybe
you'll learn a trick or two

40:47.583 --> 40:49.167
'and come back and teach us.'

40:49.250 --> 40:51.000
Thanks. I might do that.

40:51.083 --> 40:53.333
As long as you write
once in a while.

40:53.417 --> 40:54.625
I will.

40:56.583 --> 40:58.625
I won't forget you.

41:07.125 --> 41:10.833
I think I want to go
the rest of the way by myself.

41:10.917 --> 41:13.083
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

41:13.167 --> 41:14.542
Goodbye.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.583
I think she'll be alright.

41:22.667 --> 41:24.583
I think so, too.

41:24.667 --> 41:27.000
Are you busy right now?

41:27.083 --> 41:29.917
Uh, no, not right now.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.583
I wasn't exactly polite to you
over this whole thing.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.208
Yeah, well, we both
got a little hot, I think.

41:37.292 --> 41:40.375
How about if I buy you a drink
to make up for it?

41:41.625 --> 41:43.917
Okay, but I go on duty
in half an hour

41:44.000 --> 41:46.125
so it's gonna have to be coffee.

41:46.208 --> 41:47.583
Of course.

41:51.333 --> 41:53.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.708
Just wanted to say safe journey.

41:55.792 --> 41:56.958
Thanks.

41:58.333 --> 42:01.000
Alisa, there's something
I've been wondering.

42:01.083 --> 42:02.583
When you looked
into Delenn's mind

42:02.667 --> 42:05.750
did you see anything else,
anything unusual?

42:07.292 --> 42:08.917
There was one other thing.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.417
A word, "Chrysalis."
I don't know what it means.

42:13.500 --> 42:18.333
- It's a cocoon, I think.
- Cocoon? That's weird.

42:18.417 --> 42:21.542
She shut down real fast
when I touched that.

42:21.625 --> 42:24.500
- Why would she wanna hide that?
- I don't know.

42:24.583 --> 42:28.083
(man on PA)
'...is now boarding
in docking bay 4.'

42:28.167 --> 42:29.792
I guess I have to go.

42:29.875 --> 42:32.458
[exhales sharply]

42:32.542 --> 42:33.917
Good luck.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.375
Thanks.

42:37.708 --> 42:39.833
[chuckles]

42:39.917 --> 42:42.833
[announcement
in foreign language]

42:44.083 --> 42:45.708
Chrysalis.

42:47.542 --> 42:50.583
[instrumental music]

43:06.250 --> 43:07.708
[theme music]

43:34.042 --> 43:37.083
[music continues]
