WEBVTT

00:10.468 --> 00:13.638
[Sam]  Now that I know I want Julia
to be my girlfriend someday,

00:13.722 --> 00:16.016
I've decided to look nice
whenever I see her.

00:16.099 --> 00:20.437
That kind of thing is important to girls,
but looking nice is hard.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.982
Yeah. Look at you.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.442
Cock of the walk.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.445
You know, because of your hair.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.613
That makes no sense.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.367
I look nothing like a rooster.
Roosters don't even have hair.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.453
They have a coxcomb, which is fleshy.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.788
Whoa, whoa, that's like what, the...

00:38.872 --> 00:40.874
what, the red thing on a chicken's head?

00:40.957 --> 00:42.250
Yes.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.461
Coxcomb.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.172
That's a funny word.

00:53.970 --> 00:57.098
[Sam]  As far as birds go,
chickens aren't as cool as penguins,

00:57.182 --> 00:59.434
but they have some interesting habits.

01:01.352 --> 01:04.773
In a natural setting,
a rooster will entice hens into mating

01:04.856 --> 01:07.609
by spreading his feathers
and performing a demonstrative dance.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.028
Jeez!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.823
-Don't sneak up. You made me overzest.
-Why so jumpy?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.533
I know. I couldn't help myself.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.578
-These lemon squares look delicious.
-They're not for you.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.580
-They're for group.
-All right, okay.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.499
Okay, they look fantastic.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.515
[Sam]  You may see him dip one wing

01:38.598 --> 01:41.226
and dance around the female
in a circular pattern.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.022
Shit, Casey.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.149
That's a grown-ass man right there.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.652
Are you banging,
or are you still in handy land?

01:50.735 --> 01:53.071
[scoffs] Yeah, right.
Casey's a total prude.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.281
-She's never even kissed a boy.
-[laughing]

01:55.365 --> 01:59.119
You didn't mention a boyfriend. How could
you not tell me you have a boyfriend?

01:59.202 --> 02:00.745
We're just hanging out.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
-Mm-hmm.
-Hanging out with his dick.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.541
[laughing]

02:07.544 --> 02:08.545
Are you?

02:10.338 --> 02:14.175
-[whispering] Hanging out with his dick.
-[laughing] No. Sharice.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.510
Go away.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.680
[Sam]  But enticing human girls
into mating

02:18.763 --> 02:22.267
or just being your girlfriend
takes different skills.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.726
It requires research.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.521
You can't just ask a girl out.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.940
You have to learn the important things
about her first.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.567
What's your favorite type of lemonade?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.820
Uh, regular?

02:35.446 --> 02:36.698
Do you like movies?

02:37.448 --> 02:39.784
Yes. I love them.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.870
Do you have any fears or phobias?

02:43.246 --> 02:45.623
-Nope.
-What are your favorite winter sports?

02:47.584 --> 02:50.086
Well, we have been
snowshoeing a couple times.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.591
"We"? As in you and your mom.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.259
Me and my boyfriend.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.177
Snowshoeing was his idea.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.762
I hate the cold. [chuckles]

03:01.306 --> 03:02.390
You have a boyfriend?

03:02.473 --> 03:04.183
Mm-hmm. Miles.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.897
Anyway, it's great that
you're showing so much interest in others.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.523
We've been working on that.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.734
[fading] But how about we get back
to you?

03:12.817 --> 03:15.612
Now, when Mr. Tavern's
voice bothers you...

03:28.499 --> 03:31.544
[Sam]  When I was younger,
if I got upset or stressed,

03:31.628 --> 03:35.215
I would hit or bang my head or yell.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.176
Now I try to use replacement
behaviors instead.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.391
Sam.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.143
Is everything okay?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.396
Want to talk?

03:51.856 --> 03:53.233
Maybe I should talk to Mom.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.486
That's usually how things go around here,
but Mom has her group tonight.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.238
Okay? Maybe I can help.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.659
I like a girl.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.119
Really?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.916
That's good. What's she like?

04:09.999 --> 04:12.418
She's smart, and she's pretty.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.046
And she has a boyfriend-- Miles.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.256
Stupid Miles!

04:17.131 --> 04:18.633
[Doug] Well, that sucks.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.135
But, you know,
it's not the end of the world.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.680
Mom had a boyfriend when I first met her.

04:27.016 --> 04:30.311
-She did?
-This guy Gerald Redenbach.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.855
He had a Jeep and a golden retriever

04:32.939 --> 04:34.941
that wore a bandanna.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.026
She thought he was so cool.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.405
And y-you stole Mom away from him?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.116
Something like that.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.703
How?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.746
I just... stuck around,

04:48.830 --> 04:51.332
being my sweet, charming self.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.417
And that worked?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.252
Well, proof is in the pudding, right?

04:54.335 --> 04:55.670
I don't like pudding.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.422
Well, forget the pudding.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.799
The point is,
is you're young, Sam, you know.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.093
Relationships, they come and they go.

05:02.176 --> 05:06.055
She might have a boyfriend this week
and next week, who knows?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.348
Does that make sense?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.310
Yes.

05:10.393 --> 05:14.355
I should make myself available
in case Miles goes away or dies.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.692
Or they break up amicably.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.822
Okay. I'll do that.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.032
You should.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.705
I think this went well.

05:30.788 --> 05:31.956
Me, too.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.042
[chuckles]

05:36.544 --> 05:38.504
I know we're always, um...

05:38.588 --> 05:40.590
talking in here about, you know,

05:40.673 --> 05:43.217
taking time for ourselves

05:43.301 --> 05:44.343
and I did.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.014
I took a dance class. Silly.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.682
Um...

05:49.766 --> 05:52.185
The teacher thought I was really good.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.937
Really silly. But she did say that.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.690
And this is nuts, but afterwards,

05:57.774 --> 06:01.569
we all went to a bar, and I met a guy.

06:01.652 --> 06:05.364
I mean, not a guy-guy.
I'm married. You all know Doug.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.493
Not really, he doesn't come to these,
they're not his "thing."

06:08.576 --> 06:09.869
Whose thing are they?

06:09.952 --> 06:12.622
[laughs] It's not like we come here
for the fun of it.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.748
No offense.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.041
I like you guys.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.834
Marjorie, you.

06:16.918 --> 06:21.130
Um, so, Sam. Anyway. Um...

06:21.214 --> 06:23.633
Sam is-- he had a good week, you know?

06:23.716 --> 06:26.135
But the thing is, at this bar,

06:27.053 --> 06:32.350
for the first time since,
probably, Sam was diagnosed,

06:33.017 --> 06:36.521
I wasn't worried or scared.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.608
I was just having fun

06:40.691 --> 06:43.152
with a group of strangers

06:43.236 --> 06:46.906
who had nothing to do with autism.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.825
And, again, I love you guys.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.786
But this guy, this bartender I met,

06:51.869 --> 06:53.204
he is so...

06:53.704 --> 06:55.498
his life is so crazy!

06:55.581 --> 07:01.879
And risk-taking and ordinary, you know?

07:01.963 --> 07:06.717
And I just...
I realized that that's, um...

07:08.553 --> 07:10.638
It's just a life Sam's never gonna have.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.560
So, um...

07:18.104 --> 07:20.064
I don't know. I just...

07:21.524 --> 07:23.526
[sighs deeply]

07:25.528 --> 07:28.156
I made lemon squares, um...

07:28.239 --> 07:30.575
so don't anybody be shy.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.119
They're overzested.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.913
[applause]

07:37.874 --> 07:41.461
Your dad's right, bro. A girl is fair game
until there's a ring on it.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.378
A wedding ring.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.298
An engagement ring means she's ready
for one more mistake.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.093
Okay, this is perfect.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.555
Watch this.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.643
[Sam]  Sometimes I wish I was smooth,
like Zahid.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.064
Of all the people I know,
he's the best at girls.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.465
And that's how you do it.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.509
Now I'm gonna hide in the back,

08:29.592 --> 08:33.471
'cause that guy said he's gonna kick
my ass, and he has a neck tattoo, so...

08:36.724 --> 08:40.186
[chuckles] How's stuff with you?

08:40.269 --> 08:44.023
-How's Doug?
-Oh, we had a date night.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.693
-Which was a total disaster.
-Mm-hmm.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.612
Every time we have a moment, I ruin it.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.490
Stop it! You're doing great, okay?

08:52.573 --> 08:55.993
I have to say that you're a saint
for sticking with him, after what he did.

08:56.077 --> 08:56.911
Shh!

08:58.829 --> 09:00.081
That was a long time ago.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.544
How's Christopher? I meant to ask you,
since he's been mainstreamed.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.671
He's having a regression.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.756
Aw.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.466
Having anger issues.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
-Have you tried music therapy?
-[scoffs]

09:12.635 --> 09:16.514
Because I met this woman last year,
at the Autism Walk,

09:16.597 --> 09:19.517
and I think I might still have her card.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.227
She has this whole studio.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.855
She's a little bit punk rock,
but cute as a button.

09:24.939 --> 09:25.982
And...

09:27.900 --> 09:29.569
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.737
My credit card's--

09:34.365 --> 09:36.742
Cancel card.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.202
-What's going on?
-Ugh!

09:38.786 --> 09:40.621
I have to cancel the Visa.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.082
I left it at that bar after dance class.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.043
You're wearing that sweatshirt?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.837
-What's wrong with it?
-Nothing.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.423
I don't understand
why you do all that working out

09:50.506 --> 09:52.842
if you're not gonna flaunt
your cute figure.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.303
[scoffs] Oh, my God.
You want me to dress sluttier?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.637
Why are you canceling it?

09:56.721 --> 09:57.805
Identity theft.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.434
Sweetie, it was a compliment.
You're adorable under all that bulk.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.977
Bye!

10:03.060 --> 10:05.354
The bar is ten minutes away.
Just pick it up.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.107
No. I'm not gonna add another chore
to my to-do list.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.109
But all the bills are on autopay.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.613
Switching everything, that's gonna be
like ten chores right there.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.864
You want me to pick it up?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.574
-I'll get it on my way to work.
-No!

10:17.241 --> 10:19.785
-Um, you know what?
-[beeps]

10:21.162 --> 10:22.413
It's my mistake.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.207
-I'll take care of it.
-You sure?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.877
I'm sorry that I snapped at you.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.088
No. I don't even hear it anymore.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.303
[knock on door]

10:37.386 --> 10:38.721
[door opens]

10:41.307 --> 10:43.976
Coach Briggs. You wanted to see me?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.936
Yep. Come in, sit.

10:46.020 --> 10:46.979
Okay.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.732
We need to powwow.

10:50.232 --> 10:54.070
If this is about my suspension,
I'm so sorry.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.864
I really--
This team is very important to me,

10:56.947 --> 10:59.408
and I would never do anything
to mess that up.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.952
Gardner, look at this office.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.748
My life is not awesome.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.125
Do you know the one thing
that brings me joy?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.086
Other than the failures of my brother?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.007
It is girls with actual talent.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.093
-Like you!
-Mm-hmm.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.888
I took a risk bringing you
onto varsity so young.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.474
-Don't make me regret it.
-I won't.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.394
And if there's anything that I can do
to make it up to you...

11:26.477 --> 11:27.978
There is.

11:28.062 --> 11:31.148
The girl you went gangster on was
our biggest booster's daughter.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.735
Every year, her parents charter us a bus
to get us to semis,

11:34.819 --> 11:38.072
but this year they won't do it
until you apologize to their kid.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.907
Apologize?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.576
Shouldn't she for what she did to Beth?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.203
It's up to you.

11:44.286 --> 11:48.124
Your teammates won't be thrilled
when they find out they lost their bus.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.418
But you're probably fine.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.128
People always talk about how nice

11:52.211 --> 11:54.046
and humane teenage girls are
to each other.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.261
Anyway, I shouldn't have punched you
in the face,

12:00.344 --> 12:03.681
no matter how shitty you were being,
and I am sorry.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.810
Your eye's looking better.
It's almost normal.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.522
Wow. You suck at apologies.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.150
Yeah, I know that about myself.
So are we cool?

12:14.233 --> 12:17.736
Look, I know your brother
has major problems.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.865
You must have a lot of anger about that.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.535
You should get a stress ball. [laughs]

12:24.618 --> 12:28.747

24:28.216 --> 24:30.969
Julia's not a teenager. She's 26 3/4.

24:32.971 --> 24:36.266
Julia, your therapist? Sam, let's go.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.602
Get out. Come on, let's go! Let's go!

24:40.103 --> 24:41.146
[Doug] Come on!

24:41.229 --> 24:44.608
[Sam]  In the animal kingdom,
attraction is a simple biological fact.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.901
[Doug] We have to go.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.236
[Sam]  It's us humans
who make it complicated.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.947
Whoa! This is a nice backyard!

24:51.031 --> 24:52.532
You could put a pool back here.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.159
Above-ground pools are cheap.

24:54.242 --> 24:58.622
You could build a deck around it,
make it feel like a in-ground pool and...

24:58.705 --> 24:59.998
[laughs]

25:00.582 --> 25:04.836
That's sort of all I've gotta say
about pools.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.504
But...

25:08.256 --> 25:09.758
maybe you could talk now?

25:10.425 --> 25:11.426
Okay.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.387
Why did you get kicked out of my school?

25:15.555 --> 25:16.389
What?

25:16.473 --> 25:19.226
I heard you got kicked out,
and everybody has a theory.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.143
What did you do?

25:20.227 --> 25:23.563
Did you steal the principal's car?
Were you freebasing in the chem lab?

25:23.647 --> 25:25.690
-No, nothing like that.
-What happened?

25:25.774 --> 25:27.859
It doesn't matter. It was a long time ago.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.278
-Well, it matters to me.
-Why?

25:30.362 --> 25:33.698
I can't get in trouble and if
I keep hanging out with you, I will.

25:34.532 --> 25:37.077
-Why can't you just tell me?
-Because it's stupid.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.497
-Okay, just go home.
-Come on, Casey!

25:41.081 --> 25:42.249
I stole a tuba!

25:46.878 --> 25:47.712
What?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.299
I stole a tuba.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.802
And a trombone.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.680
And then a couple saxophones.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.559
I broke into the band room
one day after school,

26:01.643 --> 26:04.354
and I took some musical instruments.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.898
And then I tried to pawn them.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.735
I didn't really have a good reason why.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.905
They left the band room unlocked.
I guess that's the reason.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.740
Anyway, never mind.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.743
Ninety minutes later,
cops are at my door.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.620
They put me in cuffs.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.665
And since I stole stuff from the school

26:23.748 --> 26:26.376
that I go to, you know, like a genius...

26:26.459 --> 26:28.295
I also got expelled.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.381
So there it is.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.842
That's the full story.
I hope you're happy.

26:35.343 --> 26:38.013
[laughs]

26:38.096 --> 26:41.725
Are you serious?
You stole musical instruments?

26:41.808 --> 26:44.561
-That's what you did?
-Yeah. I told you it was stupid.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.645
[Casey laughs]

26:45.729 --> 26:46.771
Why are you laughing?

26:46.855 --> 26:48.440
Because that is hilarious!

26:48.523 --> 26:51.359
Because everyone thinks
you're, like, a total badass.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.112
-How did you carry them all?
-I brought my wagon.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.197
God, this just gets better and better.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.700
I can't believe you're laughing
at me right now.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.871
I knew that was a mistake.
I shouldn't have told you. You know what?

27:02.954 --> 27:05.040
I gotta pick up my sister
from the library.

27:05.123 --> 27:05.957
I didn't mean--

27:08.543 --> 27:09.377
Evan, wait.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.420
What?

27:26.561 --> 27:28.396
[Evan laughs]

27:28.480 --> 27:30.148
Whoa.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.191
I know.

27:35.403 --> 27:36.780
Well, I should go.

27:37.989 --> 27:41.326
Feels like awkward timing now, but I...

27:41.409 --> 27:42.744
Yeah, you should.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.996
-Yeah, go.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.975

You think there'd be, like,
regulations, you know,

28:08.853 --> 28:11.064
about things like that in a public place.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.649
It's a health hazard, right?

28:13.650 --> 28:14.692
Totally agree.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.694
Well, you have inebriated people

28:16.778 --> 28:18.947
throwing weapons across a room.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.366
I mean, it's kinda dangerous, right?

28:21.449 --> 28:22.325
[Nick chuckles]

28:23.076 --> 28:24.119
-Um...
-Yeah?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.371
-I can't really get at the...
-What?

28:26.454 --> 28:27.914
Your shirt's in the way.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.291
Of course. Yeah.

28:40.927 --> 28:41.803
There you go.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.514
Ah!

28:44.597 --> 28:46.474
Okay. Okay.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.732
Put a little Neosporin on it.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.029
Your Neosporin's expired.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.366
This stuff doesn't go bad.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.951
Uh-huh. Right.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.704
They just have so much room
on that tiny, one-inch tube

29:07.787 --> 29:10.874
that they put non-pertinent,
haphazard information.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.668
[laughs]

29:14.878 --> 29:16.379
I've never met anyone like you.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.672
Huh.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.758
[laughs]

29:20.717 --> 29:22.135
[opens wrapper]

29:22.802 --> 29:24.596
And you're all set.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.100
You can put your shirt back on.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.734
You know, we should exchange numbers.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.238
Just in case there's side effects
from that expired Neosporin.

29:43.698 --> 29:44.824
[Nick chuckles]

29:47.410 --> 29:51.498
Listen, I really think you need
to let this thing with Julia go.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.625
Why?

29:54.375 --> 29:56.169
First, she's a lot older than you.

29:56.252 --> 30:01.341
Plus, if you tell her how you really feel,
it's gonna be a conflict of interest

30:01.424 --> 30:04.177
and she's not gonna be able
to be your therapist anymore.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.179
But I need her as my therapist.

30:06.262 --> 30:07.639
Well, great.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.266
Then you should start dating someone
your own age.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.979
Like a practice girlfriend
before I date Julia?

30:15.063 --> 30:17.398
No. I wouldn't call it that.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.693
When Roald Amundsen
first explored Antarctica,

30:20.777 --> 30:24.322
he took several practice journeys
over easier terrain.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.491
It's the logical thing to do.

30:26.574 --> 30:29.369
And when I get enough experience
with other girls,

30:29.452 --> 30:32.413
then I can date Julia
and she can stop being my therapist.

30:32.497 --> 30:36.376
Or you could find a girl your own age.

30:37.377 --> 30:41.422
That's your sweet spot. Plus, those are
the girls that are gonna like you, too.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.386
That's excellent advice. Thank you.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.807
Anytime.

30:58.314 --> 30:59.607
Hey, Dad?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.776
Are you gonna tell Mom about Julia?

31:02.777 --> 31:03.820
You want me to?

31:03.903 --> 31:04.946
No, thank you.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.283
All right, well, then it's between us.

31:11.286 --> 31:15.790
I'm not trying to brag here,
but I had a really good day with Sam.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.125
You know, he's a good kid.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.544
What happened to your arm?

31:19.627 --> 31:20.920
Oh, nothing.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.423
I just scraped it on a nail in the garage.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.050
You gotta show me where it is
so I can pound it down.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.761
-Did you put something on it?
-Yeah, Neosporin.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.722
It was expired, but...

31:30.805 --> 31:32.390
That stuff doesn't expire.

31:32.473 --> 31:34.475
It just gets less effective
the more it sits around.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.443
What's that for?

31:43.526 --> 31:44.944
'Cause I'm such a good dad?

31:45.028 --> 31:46.821
-Yeah, you're Super Dad.
-Yeah?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.032
You gonna get me a cape
that says "Super Dad"?

31:49.115 --> 31:51.284
Not now. Get the light.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.329
[Elsa]
Mm.

31:56.581 --> 32:00.668
[Sam]  Human behavior is less like
a chicken and more like an albatross.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.589
No matter how far an albatross flies,
it always returns home.

32:05.340 --> 32:09.177
Unless it flies too close to the water
and gets eaten by a tiger shark.
