Um, actually,
now that I think about it,

40:24.355 --> 40:26.226
I don't have the best
hand-eye coordination,

40:26.270 --> 40:27.750
and, um, active
construction sites

40:27.793 --> 40:30.491
are full of hidden dangers.

40:30.535 --> 40:32.842
S-Splinters.

40:32.885 --> 40:35.322
Let me ask you a question.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.977
And I want you
to be perfectly honest.

40:38.021 --> 40:39.544
How weird are you?

40:41.372 --> 40:43.548
Very.
[ Scoffs ]

40:43.592 --> 40:44.854
If you only knew.

40:46.507 --> 40:48.248
Ida: You want
to talk about it?

40:48.292 --> 40:50.642
Mm...

40:50.686 --> 40:52.644
you don't really
want to hear, do you?

40:52.688 --> 40:54.864
No, not for a second.

40:54.907 --> 40:57.823
Why don't you just
tell me what's up?

40:59.825 --> 41:01.087
Bill.

41:02.306 --> 41:04.743
Bill?
What did he do now?

41:04.787 --> 41:07.137
Well... I mean,

41:07.180 --> 41:08.442
it's more what he didn't do.

41:08.486 --> 41:09.879
He keeps...

41:09.922 --> 41:11.445
hiding things from me
all the time,

41:11.489 --> 41:13.534
like I'm a child.

41:13.578 --> 41:15.058
Okay...

41:15.101 --> 41:18.322
I mean, he never
used to do that.

41:18.365 --> 41:19.845
It's the whole reason
why I wanted to start a business

41:19.889 --> 41:21.412
with him in the first place

41:21.455 --> 41:23.022
'cause he never,

41:23.066 --> 41:26.069
you know, patronized me
or coddled me

41:26.112 --> 41:29.376
or lied to me
or treated me like I was...
