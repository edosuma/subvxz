WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:02.903
What a racket.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.905
They charge, like,
a bazillion dollars

00:04.938 --> 00:06.907
for a dress you wear once.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.376
You want one, don't you?

00:08.409 --> 00:11.845
Totally. I have
such a bridal boner right now.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.981
Okay, you guys ready?
I'm coming out.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.516
Yay.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.752
Oh.
Oh.

00:20.188 --> 00:23.157
Why do you have
to have everything?

00:23.191 --> 00:24.725
Seriously,
you're gorgeous.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.026
If I didn't
love you,

00:26.060 --> 00:28.028
I would hate you
right now.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.598
You guys,
I think this is the one.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.932
I think it is.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.237
You ladies have
so much to celebrate.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.871
You're getting married,

00:37.905 --> 00:40.274
you're having a baby,
and you...

00:40.308 --> 00:43.277
you're the supportive friend.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.180
You know, in some cultures,
a woman your age

00:46.214 --> 00:49.350
would be put on an ice floe
and pushed out to sea.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.852
And I have plenty to celebrate.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.188
I have a date
with a very hot guy.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.723
Will's trainer?
Yup.

00:55.756 --> 01:00.461
It's our third date, so I
will be getting bench-pressed.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.331
If you know what I mean.

01:10.104 --> 01:13.641
Worst sex of my life!

01:14.408 --> 01:16.644
Ugh. Dead eyes,
wet kisser,

01:16.677 --> 01:18.212
pokey fingers.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.314
It was like a kid
playing "Chopsticks"

01:20.348 --> 01:22.650
on the piano, except
the piano was my va...

01:22.683 --> 01:24.552
We get it!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.287
I'm surprised
Zac was so bad in bed.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.755
He's such a great trainer,

01:27.788 --> 01:29.557
you'd think, you know,
it would translate somehow.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.127
Have you ever had a Jack Russell
terrier hump your leg?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.530
This was faster
and more humiliating.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.646
Oh, what a good hug.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.782
Hey, Charlie.
Hi, Charlie.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.083
Hi, Mom. How'd it go?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.085
Oh, we had a wonderful day
together.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.086
Didn't we, Charlie?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.489
"But the house is so cold.

02:01.522 --> 02:05.025
Gran-gran's worried I could
get the sneezie-weezies."

02:06.126 --> 02:07.595
Temperature's fine, Barbara.

02:07.628 --> 02:11.632
"I guess Daddy's pwide is more
important than my health."

02:11.665 --> 02:13.167
Here we go.
Come on.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.502
Let's go see
the giraffe.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.337
Thank you so much
for your time, Mom.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.338
We really appreciate it.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.939
Oh, it's my pleasure, honey.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.109
You know, I just talked
to Diane Shupak.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.977
Her son is going through
a divorce.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.646
He's a judge.
Mom,

02:25.679 --> 02:29.217
for the hundredth time:
I am married to Bobby.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.752
That's why pencils
have erasers.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.557
Okay, bye.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.060
God, she's so annoying.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.295
Seriously.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.630
Don't talk about my mom
like that.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.398
You always say
my mom's annoying.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.899
That's 'cause
she is annoying.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.402
All right, look, I know
this is a sensitive subject,

02:48.436 --> 02:50.471
but maybe it's time
we hire someone to help us.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.640
With the new baby coming,
it might be nice to have

02:52.673 --> 02:54.708
a little extra help.
Well, if we need the help,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.577
my mom said that she
could come every day.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.747
And here I thought being burned
alive was my biggest fear.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.717
Look, I know that my mom
isn't perfect...

03:04.885 --> 03:07.921
...but she is trustworthy

03:07.955 --> 03:09.890
and reliable and free.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.024
No, she's not free.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.260
She comes with a price.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.229
A big, passive-aggwessive pwice.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.864
Bobby, I'm, like,
insanely pregnant.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.499
I-I just, I don't
have the energy

03:18.532 --> 03:20.033
for interviews
and call references.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.235
All right, well, look,

03:21.269 --> 03:22.670
if I did all the work,
would you at least

03:22.703 --> 03:24.372
be open to sitting down
with somebody?

03:24.405 --> 03:27.275
But that means that one of us
needs to talk to her.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.943
"One of us" is never you.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.414
So the truth is, Andi and I
feel like

03:33.447 --> 03:34.915
we've become
too reliant on you.

03:34.948 --> 03:39.052
So, as much as
it pains me to say it,

03:39.086 --> 03:40.888
we're gonna hire a nanny.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.395
Anyhoo, uh...

03:47.428 --> 03:49.196
this is great news
for you, too,

03:49.229 --> 03:50.464
because now
you'll have more time

03:50.498 --> 03:52.199
to pursue your many interests,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.234
like sending meals back
at restaurants

03:54.268 --> 03:56.570
and tracking
where drafts come from.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.242
You're an angry,
angry ginger-man.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.247
And I'm free.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.054
So, uh...
how much longer

04:14.087 --> 04:16.223
do you want me to do
this warm-up run for?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.158
It-It's been 30 minutes.

04:18.191 --> 04:22.430
30 minutes, 60 minutes--
what does it matter?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.765
It matters
if I have a heart attack.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.403
I'm sorry, I just haven't
been myself

04:29.437 --> 04:30.904
since I got Kate's text.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.741
I don't know, maybe I'm
reading too much into it.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.242
Let me get your opinion.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.945
"It's over. Best of luck."

04:39.347 --> 04:40.748
I'm sorry, Will.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.983
I don't really feel up
to finishing our session.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.453
Zac, come on, I need you, man.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.488
I'm-I'm back
in the dating world again.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.090
You should see the guys
I'm competing with.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.594
Dude, you're a friend;
you got to help me out here.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.763
I'm spiraling.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.835
My bad.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.104
All right, if I help you out
with this whole Kate thing,

05:04.137 --> 05:05.606
will you be able
to train me again?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.940
Dude, I'll train you so hard,

05:06.974 --> 05:09.643
they'll be able to see
your muscles from space.

05:09.677 --> 05:14.448
Well, then you, my friend,
are gonna have to, uh...

05:14.482 --> 05:16.384
change some things up
in the bedroom.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.319
I didn't hear
anyone complaining.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.054
Well, I did.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.691
Kate.
Oh, man!

05:23.724 --> 05:25.459
That's the worst person
you could have said.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.961
Yeah, listen, hey,
don't worry about it, man.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.530
I know women.

05:29.563 --> 05:33.667
Right. They say no one knows
women better than a gay man.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.804
I'm not gay.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.971
I understand.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.973
Whenever you're ready, bro.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.809
No, I'm not gay.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.143
I mean, I'm stylish,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.979
but that doesn't
necessarily mean I...

05:46.013 --> 05:48.248
You know, never mind.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.350
The point is,
I'm also a gynecologist.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.521
I literally have a PhD
in vagina.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.390
You willing to listen and learn?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.891
Absolutely.
When do we start?

05:57.925 --> 06:00.728
Right now. You ever play
"Chopsticks" on the piano?

06:00.761 --> 06:01.562
Of course.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.031
Don't ever do it again.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.936
Well, I did it!

06:08.969 --> 06:10.404
After a day

06:10.438 --> 06:12.506
of extensive interviews,
I found us a perfect nanny.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.874
Mm.
Degree in child
development,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.209
grad student at UCLA,
tons of experience.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.878
Fantastic! When do I get
to meet her?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.580
How about now? I mean,
Charlie loved her so much,

06:19.613 --> 06:20.914
he wouldn't let her
leave the interview.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.816
Oh.
Emma?

06:24.117 --> 06:26.454
Hi.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.058
I'm Emma, but all my friends
call me Emmie.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.960
Oh. Are those your friends?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.295
Ah.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.064
Oh, gosh.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.632
Charlie undid my button.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.569
Oh. Charlie's
first button!

06:49.076 --> 06:51.779
Don't tell me you haven't
ordered the wedding dress yet.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.448
No, not yet. I love it,
but it's so expensive,

06:54.482 --> 06:55.749
so I'm still thinking about it.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.250
Okay, well,
think no more,

06:57.284 --> 06:58.752
because I have
the perfect dress.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.588
Mom sent it
from Australia.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.456
Oh.
This dress has been in
our family for years.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.292
Darling, you can be a part
of the grand tradition.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.060
Oh, this is so fun!

07:07.094 --> 07:08.929
I'm gonna try this on.
Do it.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.899
Ah, Kate,
I need a favor.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.266
No.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.235
You don't even know
what I'm gonna ask.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.339
I can tell by your spastic
sprint and your needy stare.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.575
I'm not interested.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.512
Listen, I got to have
my trainer back,

07:24.545 --> 07:26.313
and he can't work
because of you.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.616
Well, I can't work
because of him.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.251
Do you know
that he licked his finger

07:31.284 --> 07:34.187
and traced it around my mouth?

07:34.221 --> 07:38.091
Like some kind
of saliva lip gloss.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.428
I have to live with that.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.196
Just give him one more chance.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.865
He spit-glossed me, Will!

07:44.898 --> 07:46.266
Fine, but, look,

07:46.299 --> 07:47.768
the truth is...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.637
Wait. I-I can't tell you that.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.705
I'd be... I'd be
betraying his confidence.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.875
Please, feel free, betray.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.343
Okay.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.978
But, listen, you promise
not to say anything?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.948
He told me the reason he was
so nervous and off his game is

08:00.981 --> 08:04.117
'cause he thinks
you're just so incredibly hot.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.019
That makes sense. Go on.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.523
Yeah, so, you know,
he just got all up in his head.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.458
I really think you should
give him another chance.

08:11.491 --> 08:15.729
Well, he is
packing a python.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.400
Hey. Did you find
a nanny?

08:20.433 --> 08:22.135
Yes.
No.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.737
Let me ask you guys.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.139
Should we hire
a super hot nanny?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.175
Definitely not.
No!
Well, well, hold on!

08:28.208 --> 08:31.912
Are you suggesting that we deny
this poor woman a job

08:31.945 --> 08:34.815
in the house that I live in
just because she's hot?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.884
How can you even
be considering this?

08:36.917 --> 08:40.220
It's like asking for trouble,
and then paying for it.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.556
This is outrageous.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.057
"Should we hire a hot nanny?"

08:44.091 --> 08:46.193
Even the question is offensive.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.494
If you replaced

08:47.527 --> 08:49.029
the word "hot"
with "black" or "Jewish,"

08:49.062 --> 08:51.565
we would not be having
this conversation.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.533
Come on, Will.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.669
Oh, it's fine for the hots
to model our swimsuits,

08:55.703 --> 08:58.872
but God forbid we let them
care for our children.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.674
Look, I don't care what
she looks like, all right?

09:00.708 --> 09:02.576
I just want to hire the
best person for the job.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.277
And out of all the
people that I met,

09:04.311 --> 09:06.513
Emmie by far had the
best credentials.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.682
Did she have
really big credentials?

09:08.716 --> 09:12.385
Okay, so if I find someone
with better credentials,

09:12.419 --> 09:16.456
who doesn't look like "Emmie,"
you'll be just as excited?

09:16.489 --> 09:17.791
Absolutely.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.292
No.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.594
All right.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.963
Here I come.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.370
Aw, darling, spectacular.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.705
What a vision!

09:31.739 --> 09:33.607
I got to call my mum!

09:34.574 --> 09:37.377
What is happening?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.312
It's Lowell's
great-grandmother's

09:39.346 --> 09:40.313
wedding dress.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.916
That she was
buried in?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.389
Hey!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.557
How's it going, buddy?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.493
Hey, man, how are you?

09:53.526 --> 09:54.762
Charlie?

09:54.795 --> 09:56.664
Hi.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.398
Hi. Who are you?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.100
This is our new nanny, Sam.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.068
Oh.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.170
Hi, Sam.
Hey.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.072
Nice to meet you.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.940
Excuse me.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.610
Word, please?

10:11.779 --> 10:14.247
Are you serious?

10:14.281 --> 10:15.515
You said
if I found someone

10:15.548 --> 10:16.984
with better credentials,
I should hire him.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.319
Him? I never said
anything about a him.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.754
Where'd you find
this guy anyway?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.756
Spraying cologne
at the Beverly Center?

10:22.790 --> 10:25.092
Actually,
he has a master's

10:25.125 --> 10:27.761
in child development, and he's
the oldest of seven siblings,

10:27.795 --> 10:29.196
so he has plenty of experience.
He's perfect.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.531
Yeah, well, I can see
why you think he's perfect.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.433
Oh, please. I just want
what's best for our son.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.203
Who wants to meet
the tickle monster?

10:36.236 --> 10:37.537
I do!

10:37.570 --> 10:40.273
I mean, Charlie does.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.142
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.911
Tickle, tickle...

10:45.979 --> 10:48.782
I mean, it is a whole new world
having a nanny.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.184
I actually had time
to take a shower this morning.

10:51.218 --> 10:54.287
You know, you do look
quite nice, actually.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.355
Mm.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.790
She's dressing up for the nanny.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.459
What are you even...

10:59.492 --> 11:02.295
That's crazy.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.797
It's great.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.700
You shaved your legs for
the first time in six months.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.804
I wish it were for me,
but I'll take what I can get.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.906
Wow, seven years
of marriage,

11:12.940 --> 11:16.109
and the romance is
still white-hot.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.846
Hello, hello.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.647
So, gave Zac another chance,

11:20.680 --> 11:22.750
and guess how many orgasms
he gave me.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.851
I don't like this game.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.352
Three. The best of my life.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.520
I didn't have to teach him
a thing. It's so weird.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.489
He was completely different
this time.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.260
What?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.427
Uh...

11:34.461 --> 11:36.029
You're welcome.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.332
What do you mean?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.835
Well, I gave Zac a few tips
during our training session.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.503
So, uh,
by the transitive property,

11:43.536 --> 11:46.373
it is I who rocked your world.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.844
I who gave you
all those orgasms.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.512
How-how is that
even possible?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.347
It's not. He didn't.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.448
Oh, but I did.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.683
I pulled the strings.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.085
I am the puppet master.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.586
His extremities
were but a mere

11:59.619 --> 12:00.954
extension of my will.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.356
Thrust, thrust,
turn around, thrust.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.625
Oh, stop it!

12:05.658 --> 12:07.861
It is not true.
You are not good in bed.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.296
I'm great in bed.
Please.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.631
I have seen you dance,
I've seen you eat,

12:11.664 --> 12:12.933
I've watched you Rollerblade.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.601
You are bad at everything.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.969
Look, in Will's defense,

12:16.003 --> 12:17.537
the man is a gynecologist.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.607
I mean, most people spend
eight hours a day in a cubicle.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.642
Our cubicle is a vagina.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.877
It's true.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.378
He has amazing skills.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.479
I almost feel bad

12:26.513 --> 12:28.148
that he doesn't get to use 'em,

12:28.181 --> 12:30.617
but then I just have a snack
and forget all about that.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.053
I'm sorry,
but there is no way

12:33.086 --> 12:35.889
mere words could achieve
that kind of result.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.392
You think you pep-talked my eyes
into the back of my head?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.660
I think I did.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.829
I know you didn't.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.296
I'm sure I did.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.464
I'm positive you didn't.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.565
Let's just agree to disagree.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.567
I disagree and will not agree.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.902
Careful.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.637
What the puppet master giveth,

12:50.670 --> 12:53.306
the puppet master
can taketh away.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.177
God, all of this talk
about sex is making me...

12:57.210 --> 12:58.178
Hungry?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.447
You just get me.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.686
I don't understand.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.090
It's like you want me to do the
opposite of what I did before.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.591
Exactly.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.927
See, Kate craves variety.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.195
Sex with her has to be

13:15.228 --> 13:16.964
a constantly moving
stream of feelings

13:16.997 --> 13:19.833
and sensations and colors.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.434
That's weird,
'cause it seemed like

13:21.468 --> 13:23.703
she just wanted it really hard.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.307
Right. So now...
it must be soft.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.608
All right.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.111
Here's a hot-ass move.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.347
Try tracing your fingers
around her face slowly

13:34.381 --> 13:37.184
in the shape of a heart.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.555
This might be why
you think I'm gay.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.500
You can't seriously
wear that gothic nightmare

13:53.533 --> 13:55.869
of a dress.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.804
The other one
was so perfect.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.408
Well, I-I care more about
Lowell than any dress.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.476
Why?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.912
Because I love him.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.679
And this dress is
a family tradition,

14:06.713 --> 14:08.215
so I'm going
to make it work.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.683
It just needs
to be altered...

14:10.717 --> 14:12.352
and dry-cleaned.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.587
And burned.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.660
Where are you going?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.363
Nowhere.

14:23.396 --> 14:27.000
Why are you dressed
like Tina Turner?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.002
What are you talking about?

14:29.036 --> 14:30.703
These are my normal...

14:30.737 --> 14:34.107
around-the-house,
hangout... clothes.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.478
Ah...
Ah...

14:42.749 --> 14:45.718
It was you.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.521
Whatever do you mean?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.523
You undid Zac.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.792
Did I?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.262
Soft forehead kisses?

14:55.295 --> 14:56.796
Meaningful stares?

14:56.829 --> 14:59.599
He face-hearted me, Will.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.371
It took me half an hour
to convince him to go back

15:04.404 --> 15:05.638
to what he did before.

15:05.672 --> 15:09.409
The puppet master tooketh away.

15:09.442 --> 15:13.480
Keep your hand out
of my puppet, Will!

15:21.254 --> 15:23.223
All right,
ready for bath time?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.491
Rub a dub dub.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.295
I'll see you guys up there.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.663
My feet. My back.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.899
My feet.
My back.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.435
Almost forgot
Splashy Duck.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.504
Oh, no. Not Splashy Duck.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.145
Barbara?

15:45.178 --> 15:48.015
I'm just leaving
a little gift for Charlie.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.149
You want to come in?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.583
Oh, I'd love to, Robert.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.952
But I think it would be
less painful for the child

15:52.986 --> 15:58.625
if you let the memory of me
just fade away.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.127
But you left him a gift.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.428
I didn't sign the card.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.197
Just tell him
it's from a friend.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.932
Let's cut to
the chase, Barbara.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.367
I mean, you're
Charlie's grandmother.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.102
You want to see Charlie,
that's great.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.537
But I don't have to put up

16:10.570 --> 16:12.539
with your passive-
aggressiveness anymore.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.007
Because we don't need you.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.343
Our new nanny
is fantastic.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.278
He takes amazing
care of Charlie,

16:18.311 --> 16:20.347
he doesn't complain
about the temperature,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.982
and he doesn't
stop up the toilet.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.118
That's right, Barbara.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.520
I know.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.492
Yeah.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.166
You ever do something you've
been waiting forever to do?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.034
We need to fire Sam.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.835
What?
Yeah.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.538
Do you realize how exhausting it
is to look like this every day?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.140
So don't look like this.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.142
I can't walk around in front of
him like I do in front of you.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.877
It's embarrassing.
So let me
get this straight.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.379
Because of your
hormonal insanity,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.714
we have to get rid
of a perfectly good nanny?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.349
And you know who we need?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.651
Emmie?

16:58.685 --> 17:02.189
The devil we know is better
than the devil we don't.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.758
The devil.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.729
I miss my mother, Bobby.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.199
So, I guess
what I'm trying to say

17:12.232 --> 17:15.702
is that I need you
to come back.

17:17.304 --> 17:21.441
I take no pleasure in
seeing you like this.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.346
No. That's not you at all.

17:26.379 --> 17:30.250
But humility is a
good color on you.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.252
Do you want to come back or not?

17:32.285 --> 17:37.457
The thermostat goes
no lower than 73,

17:37.490 --> 17:42.862
Thanksgiving's at my house
for the next three years,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.398
and you're sending
me on a cruise.

17:45.432 --> 17:49.669
I do like the thought of you
in the middle of an ocean.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.644
So you're never gonna talk to
Will about our sex life again.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.146
Never.
From now on,

17:59.179 --> 18:00.980
it's just the two of us.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.615
The two of us.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.917
Don't forget about me.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.720
You seem to be
enjoying yourself.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.755
No!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.257
What's wrong?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.724
Nothing.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.726
Sorry. As you were.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.367
Look at that;
we're about to have sex.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.469
You like my tight little body?

18:22.502 --> 18:23.436
Stop it!

18:23.470 --> 18:24.937
Ah, stop it!

18:24.971 --> 18:26.906
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.742
It's not you. It's him!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.378
Ugh!

18:38.151 --> 18:39.819
All right, we better get going.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.954
You're my ride, so...
All right, well,
I'd better go, too.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.523
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

18:43.556 --> 18:44.757
You can't go.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.926
You haven't seen Jules
in her wedding attire yet.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.361
The accessories
have arrived!

18:50.129 --> 18:52.799
I didn't know there
were accessories.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.438
I don't know, Jules.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.540
Feel like you're showing
a little too much ankle.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.708
Mm.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.314
Tell me, was it scary
when the Titanic went down?

19:08.548 --> 19:12.819
You look like
Miss Tuberculosis 1853.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.455
Guys, it's not funny.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.658
I am a part of the great
Peddit family tradition.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.227
Yes, you are.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.062
The great
Peddit family tradition...

19:23.095 --> 19:25.164
of pranking the bride.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.968
What?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.803
It's just a joke!

19:30.837 --> 19:32.839
A joke?

19:32.872 --> 19:36.042
Wow. What a douche move.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.710
I love it.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.046
All right,
you got me.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.181
Welcome to
the family, man.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.351
I thought I became a part
of the family a while ago.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.586
No.
Nope,
just now.
Yeah.
