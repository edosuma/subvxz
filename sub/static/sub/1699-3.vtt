WEBVTT

00:07.238 --> 00:08.080
Corey

00:08.082 --> 00:09.922
have you been using
my CD player again?

00:10.373 --> 00:11.767
No.

00:11.768 --> 00:14.958
Then why is there
bologna in it?

00:17.038 --> 00:17.834
Are you mad?

00:17.835 --> 00:18.892
You got that right.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.646
Then it's done its job.
Look, toad...

00:20.647 --> 00:21.748
Hey, hey!

00:21.749 --> 00:23.045
That's enough
out of you two.

00:23.046 --> 00:25.216
Don't make me turn this kitchen
around 'cause...

00:25.217 --> 00:26.346
I will.

00:29.473 --> 00:30.642
Okay, uh, Corey

00:30.643 --> 00:31.686
have you thought
about what friends

00:31.687 --> 00:32.746
you want to bring
to the movies

00:32.747 --> 00:33.739
for your birthday
tomorrow?

00:33.740 --> 00:34.674
Just Steve and Mark.

00:34.675 --> 00:36.241
That's all? You sure
you don't want

00:36.242 --> 00:37.594
to do something a little
bit more special?

00:37.595 --> 00:38.386
Why bother?

00:38.387 --> 00:40.423
Every year
Billy Cochran has his party

00:40.424 --> 00:43.325
the day before mine,
and everybody likes it better.

00:43.326 --> 00:45.672
Hey, Corey, um,
did you ever consider

00:45.673 --> 00:48.718
that maybe it's not the
party they liked better?

00:52.491 --> 00:53.360
Well, how would you like me

00:53.361 --> 00:55.238
to make that flower
a permanent part of your head?

00:55.239 --> 00:56.004
Can you reach it?

00:56.005 --> 00:57.778
Okay. Okay, okay!

00:57.779 --> 00:59.475
That's enough, you two.

01:00.991 --> 01:02.200
How come you always

01:02.201 --> 01:03.373
have to get
in his face like that?

01:03.374 --> 01:04.140
You're his big sister.

01:04.141 --> 01:05.485
You should know better.

01:05.486 --> 01:06.535
Dad, this is part

01:06.536 --> 01:07.846
of the morning
routine, okay?

01:07.847 --> 01:09.299
Take a bath,
brush my teeth

01:09.300 --> 01:10.538
fight with Corey,
eat a muffin.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.799
Honey, you remember
Lucy Sherman?

01:14.800 --> 01:17.135
You two were the best of friends
until third grade.

01:17.136 --> 01:17.865
Then for some reason

01:17.866 --> 01:19.429
you started picking
at each other.

01:19.430 --> 01:20.741
Mom, what does she have
to do with anything?

01:20.742 --> 01:22.216
We don't even talk anymore.

01:22.217 --> 01:23.318
You don't?

01:23.319 --> 01:25.349
Oh, gee, did I just
make a point?

01:27.554 --> 01:28.379
And you think

01:28.380 --> 01:30.064
that's actually going to happen
with me and Corey?

01:30.065 --> 01:31.617
Mama, please.

01:31.618 --> 01:33.599
He is probably upstairs
right now

01:33.600 --> 01:35.514
putting hot dogs
in my blow dryer.

01:39.723 --> 01:41.194
You're the worst sister.

01:41.195 --> 01:42.122
I hate you.

01:46.803 --> 01:48.499
All we're saying
is that one day

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
you're going to push
him a little too far.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.194 --> 02:42.631
Yep, that's me.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.994
I've never had a vision
like this before, you guys.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.929
Corey said
that I was the worst sister

02:51.930 --> 02:53.438
and that he hated me.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.429
Rae

02:54.430 --> 02:56.077
my brother says
he hates me all the time.

02:56.078 --> 02:57.634
I mean,
it doesn't mean anything.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.216
Eddie, your brother's two.

02:59.217 --> 03:00.729
Okay, all he can say is

03:00.730 --> 03:03.099
"I hate you"
and "I have poopy in my pants."

03:04.801 --> 03:05.629
Rae

03:05.630 --> 03:07.502
maybe you're making
too big a deal out of this.

03:07.503 --> 03:09.871
But you guys did not see
this look on his face.

03:09.872 --> 03:13.211
Okay, I have never seen
him so angry at me before.

03:13.212 --> 03:13.867
What if

03:13.868 --> 03:15.134
he never talks to me again?

03:15.135 --> 03:17.136
Oh, right,
and that would be a bad thing?

03:18.574 --> 03:19.546
That was funny.

03:20.002 --> 03:21.802
This is not a joke,
you guys, okay?

03:22.614 --> 03:24.401
This is my
little brother.

03:24.402 --> 03:26.051
I just can't have him hate me.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.445
Look who's home.

03:36.446 --> 03:39.370
Looks like someone needs
a little pillow fluffing.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.399
There you go.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.145
Can't hate a pillow-fluffer,
can you?

03:50.615 --> 03:51.862
So, um

03:51.863 --> 03:53.461
how was your day?

03:57.660 --> 04:00.034
We all went to the aquarium
for Billy's birthday

04:00.035 --> 04:01.194
and had a great time.

04:01.195 --> 04:02.630
I hated it.

04:04.830 --> 04:07.749
Oh, well, maybe
a little...

04:07.750 --> 04:10.600
candy will make
it all better.

04:16.242 --> 04:17.560
You take the first bite.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.180
Well, we won't
be gone too long.

04:21.182 --> 04:22.164
We're going
to walk down

04:22.165 --> 04:24.065
to that new seafood
restaurant for dinner.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.384
Okay, you go
to bed early, honey.

04:28.385 --> 04:30.085
You've got a big
birthday tomorrow.

04:30.435 --> 04:32.070
Oh, and take a bath.

04:32.435 --> 04:33.730
With soap.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.160
And water.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.426
And don't put that same
underwear back on.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.959
Don't feel bad, son.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.230
Your mama tells me
the same thing.

04:47.373 --> 04:50.238
Wow, Corey,
your tenth birthday!

04:50.239 --> 04:51.826
And you know
what you need?

04:51.827 --> 04:54.395
You need a "My party is better
than Billy's party" party

04:54.396 --> 04:55.962
and I'm going to give it to you.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.463
Really?
Mm-hmm.

04:58.141 --> 04:59.508
What's in it for you?

05:01.460 --> 05:03.964
Just to know
that I am the one who put that

05:03.965 --> 05:06.182
beautiful smile on your face.

05:06.901 --> 05:08.434
Well, if that's all you're after

05:08.435 --> 05:09.602
you can just move out.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.859
I could, but, um

05:15.860 --> 05:17.859
I mean, then you would miss that

05:17.860 --> 05:20.442
great party that I'm going
to throw for you.

05:20.443 --> 05:21.759
What kind of party?

05:21.760 --> 05:23.631
I don't know yet,
but whatever it is

05:23.632 --> 05:25.468
I promise you,
you won't hate me...

05:25.469 --> 05:26.559
it.

05:27.143 --> 05:29.060
You-you won't hate it.

05:43.460 --> 05:44.729
Hey, y'all.

05:44.730 --> 05:46.736
Welcome to Corey's
tenth birthday party.

05:46.737 --> 05:47.920
It's going to be the bomb.

05:47.921 --> 05:49.335
Come on in.
Come on.

05:50.140 --> 05:52.593
I'll take that present,
thank you.

05:52.594 --> 05:54.099
Hi.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.406
Sounds cheap, sweetie.

05:55.407 --> 05:56.588
I'll get you something better.

05:57.669 --> 05:59.004
Hey, all right.

05:59.535 --> 06:00.657
Hi, Billy.

06:00.658 --> 06:01.959
There's no way

06:01.960 --> 06:03.943
your party's going
to be better than mine.

06:04.795 --> 06:05.959
Oh, well

06:05.960 --> 06:07.825
actually, my brother's
birthday party

06:07.826 --> 06:09.834
is going to be tight,
thank you very much.

06:09.835 --> 06:11.229
Tell them where we're going.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.440
We're going
to the San Francisco Zoo.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.899
The zoo?

06:14.900 --> 06:16.260
That's your great idea?

06:16.886 --> 06:18.470
Zip it, okay?

06:18.770 --> 06:21.694
'Cause, uh, he's not finished,
all right? Finish.

06:21.695 --> 06:24.394
My dad got us VIP passes
to the Reptile House.

06:24.395 --> 06:26.464
We get to party
with the pythons.

06:26.465 --> 06:29.614
Yeah!

06:29.615 --> 06:31.029
Rae, you're the best.

06:31.030 --> 06:33.273
I know I am
'cause I'm your sister

06:33.274 --> 06:35.029
and you love me.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.681
Now, keep that thought.

06:36.682 --> 06:37.991
I'm going to go get Mom and Dad

06:37.992 --> 06:39.707
so we can go to the zoo.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.199
What are you guys
still doing in bed?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.899
Get dressed.
We got to go to the zoo.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.591
Your mom and I got
food poisoning

06:46.592 --> 06:48.510
from the seafood restaurant
last night.

06:48.863 --> 06:51.325
You know that leftover linguine

06:51.326 --> 06:53.526
with clams we brought home?

06:54.309 --> 06:55.484
Throw it out.

06:56.579 --> 06:58.301
Oh, did I say throw...?

07:02.981 --> 07:04.140
Honey, we're going

07:04.141 --> 07:05.523
to have to cancel
Corey's party.

07:05.524 --> 07:06.889
Honey!

07:06.890 --> 07:08.974
Dad, we cannot
cancel Corey's party, okay?

07:08.975 --> 07:09.947
He's going to hate me.

07:09.948 --> 07:10.931
No, he won't.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.436
Now, you're a
psychic, right, baby?

07:12.437 --> 07:14.854
Tell me how long your
mama's going to be in there.

07:16.930 --> 07:19.646
Go, Corey! Go, Corey!

07:19.647 --> 07:22.054
Go, Corey! Go, Corey!

07:22.055 --> 07:24.464
Go, Corey! Go, Corey...

07:24.465 --> 07:25.699
Listen to that.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.310
I think I'm the man.

07:29.630 --> 07:31.594
Yeah, but I got some
bad news, sweetie.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.231
Mom and Dad have
food poisoning

07:33.232 --> 07:34.834
so we have to
cancel your party.

07:34.835 --> 07:36.681
You're canceling my party?

07:36.682 --> 07:38.833
Hey, Corey's party's a wipe.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.429
Who wants to go to my house?

07:40.430 --> 07:42.294
They have a big screen TV.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.649
Go, Billy! Go, Billy.

07:44.650 --> 07:47.129
Go, Billy! Go, Billy...

07:47.130 --> 07:49.468
Great. Now I'm going
to be a big joke.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.632
I knew I should have
just gone to the movies.

07:51.633 --> 07:52.203
No, no, no, no, no.

07:52.204 --> 07:52.649
You know what?

07:52.650 --> 07:54.532
We can still have fun here,
Corey.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.556
I'll tell you what.

07:55.557 --> 07:57.757
If we can't go to
the zoo, then, uh...

07:58.574 --> 08:00.194
the zoo can come to us.

08:00.195 --> 08:01.437
Really?
Yes.

08:01.438 --> 08:02.431
You can do that?

08:02.432 --> 08:03.210
Go, Billy!

08:03.211 --> 08:04.284
Go, Billy! Go, Billy...

08:04.285 --> 08:06.706
Hey, guys, my
sister says

08:06.707 --> 08:08.523
the zoo's coming to us!

08:08.524 --> 08:09.907
Go, Corey!

08:09.908 --> 08:11.173
Go, Corey!

08:11.174 --> 08:12.272
Go, Corey!

08:12.273 --> 08:13.306
Go, Corey!

08:13.307 --> 08:14.472
Go, Corey!

08:14.473 --> 08:15.990
Go, Corey.

08:18.949 --> 08:21.239
Okay, they ate all
of the animal crackers

08:21.240 --> 08:22.492
and now they want
the real thing.

08:22.493 --> 08:24.765
So, did you find an animal guy
that can come to the house?

08:24.766 --> 08:26.377
Well, I've tried
Sammy the Snakeman

08:26.378 --> 08:28.437
Pythons on Parade,
and Lizards of Oz.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.556
They're all booked.

08:30.630 --> 08:32.190
Chelsea, thank you so much.

08:32.191 --> 08:33.294
How did everything go?

08:33.294 --> 08:34.732
Great. My mom had lots
of party stuff.

08:34.732 --> 08:36.399
There's, like, hats
and balloons and...

08:36.400 --> 08:38.731
Oh, oh, there's this happy
50th birthday sign.

08:38.732 --> 08:40.340
Oh, great. Um, here's some scissors.

08:40.341 --> 08:42.164
Cut off 40 years,
thank you.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.127
Okay, so, uh, did you try...

08:45.128 --> 08:47.786
oh, this guy named Reptile Rick?

08:47.787 --> 08:49.674
Reptile Rick's coming
to my party?

08:49.675 --> 08:51.629
He's even more fun than the zoo.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.834
Hey, everybody,
Reptile Rick's coming!

08:53.835 --> 08:56.360
Yay!

08:57.432 --> 08:58.399
I know.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.765
Going through your whole life

08:59.766 --> 09:01.437
with a first name like Reptile.

09:08.391 --> 09:09.379
Good day.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.566
Reptile Rick here.

09:10.567 --> 09:12.422
I'm on a bit of a walkabout

09:12.423 --> 09:14.601
so leave me a message
at the beep.

09:14.602 --> 09:15.954
Rae, just forget it.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.551
He's probably booked.

09:17.552 --> 09:18.405
Okay, you know what?

09:18.406 --> 09:19.619
Your problem is,
you just don't know

09:19.620 --> 09:21.879
how to handle these people,
all right? Listen to this.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.259
Oh, good day, mate.

09:23.260 --> 09:24.957
This is Raven
from Down Under.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.659
I need you to
come to a party

09:26.660 --> 09:30.294
at 419 Miranda Place
lickety-splitsy, all right?

09:30.295 --> 09:32.264
No worries. Um,
I'm in a bit of

09:32.265 --> 09:34.529
a... wobbly?

09:34.530 --> 09:36.170
All right, good day.

09:37.057 --> 09:38.129
What do you think?

09:38.130 --> 09:40.010
I wouldn't bet my wobbly on it.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.843
Okay, now,
with this hair

09:52.844 --> 09:54.529
and, uh,
your complexion

09:54.530 --> 09:57.416
I definitely say
that you're a...

09:57.417 --> 09:59.664
Let me... yes, you're an autumn.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.181
So I'd stay away

10:01.182 --> 10:02.575
from the pinks

10:02.576 --> 10:03.865
and, and...

10:05.394 --> 10:07.376
and the peaches,
all right?

10:07.377 --> 10:08.788
Now don't
crowd around.

10:08.789 --> 10:10.430
I will do everybody.

10:10.431 --> 10:11.992
I'm going to go check
on the zoo.

10:11.993 --> 10:13.920
Aren't we having such fun?

10:19.094 --> 10:21.355
So, did Reptile Rick
call back yet?

10:21.356 --> 10:22.427
No,
he didn't, Rae.

10:22.428 --> 10:23.579
Just face it: he's not coming.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.420
You're just going to have
to tell Corey the truth, Rae.

10:25.421 --> 10:26.582
And have him hate me?

10:26.583 --> 10:28.659
Have him think that I am
the worst sister ever?

10:28.660 --> 10:31.465
You're giving makeup advice
to ten-year-old boys.

10:31.466 --> 10:33.266
I think that ship has sailed.

10:36.788 --> 10:38.096
Everyone wants to go home.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.708
Is Reptile Rick coming or not?

10:39.709 --> 10:41.374
Can I answer that?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.614
Reptile Rick.

10:45.615 --> 10:47.632
That's right, mate.
I'm Reptile Rick.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.674
And you must be
the birthday boy.

10:51.074 --> 10:53.260
Everyone, Reptile Rick's here!

10:54.506 --> 10:55.735
You must be Raven.

10:55.736 --> 10:56.773
Yeah, I...

10:56.774 --> 10:57.541
Take that.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.346
Oh, okay, Rick.

10:59.347 --> 11:00.284
Well, you know

11:00.285 --> 11:03.445
this is not exactly the lizard
that I ordered because...

11:05.072 --> 11:06.854
I thought your name
was Reptile Rick

11:06.855 --> 11:09.400
not "Big Pig
in my Kitchen" Rick.

11:10.323 --> 11:11.559
Hey, easy, Sheila.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.864
I've got all the reptiles
you want out in the, uh

11:13.865 --> 11:14.959
out in the truck.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.927
Personally, I don't
really think

11:15.928 --> 11:17.617
that animals should
be kept in cages.

11:17.618 --> 11:19.255
Oh, yeah? Neither do I.

11:19.256 --> 11:20.752
Let's let it out,
shall we?

11:20.753 --> 11:21.926
No!

11:22.931 --> 11:26.521
I- I mean, uh,
it might scare the kids.

11:27.135 --> 11:28.594
Right.

11:29.061 --> 11:30.964
So, um, is this little guy

11:30.965 --> 11:31.939
part of your act?

11:31.940 --> 11:34.442
Oh, no. This is Fanny,
my potbellied pig.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.689
Isn't she a beaut?

11:35.690 --> 11:37.057
Couldn't leave her
in the truck.

11:37.058 --> 11:38.920
Last time I did,
she squealed on me.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.612
Squealed on me.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.623
You don't get it.

11:42.624 --> 11:44.767
Anyway, you got
anything to eat?

11:44.768 --> 11:47.013
I just did four shows
with no lunch.

11:47.014 --> 11:48.394
You know, I'm starving.

11:48.395 --> 11:49.433
Rae!

11:49.434 --> 11:50.895
Oh, okay, ha...

11:50.896 --> 11:53.185
That's my mom, so you go
get whatever you need.

11:53.186 --> 11:54.418
Just search around.

11:54.419 --> 11:55.749
I need you to check
on the kids

11:55.750 --> 11:56.677
Well, I go check on my mom

11:56.678 --> 11:57.295
and you need to...

11:57.296 --> 11:58.657
whatever's in there,
don't let it out.

11:58.658 --> 11:59.454
And you...

12:00.860 --> 12:02.973
Okay, you need
a tissue. Okay.

12:05.863 --> 12:08.115
Okay, so are you guys
feeling okay?

12:08.116 --> 12:10.047
What is all that
noise downstairs?

12:10.048 --> 12:12.089
Oh, that? You know, that's
just Corey and his friends

12:12.090 --> 12:13.757
'cause, Mom, I really
didn't have the heart

12:13.758 --> 12:15.471
to cancel his party,
so you know, I'm just doing

12:15.472 --> 12:17.776
a little something for him
downstairs. Nothing big.

12:17.777 --> 12:19.742
Why don't you let him watch
some videos or something?

12:20.228 --> 12:21.259
Last thing
we need

12:21.260 --> 12:22.598
is a zoo down there.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.313
Interesting choice of words.

12:36.462 --> 12:37.926
Hey, Rick, no.

12:37.927 --> 12:39.258
You're not supposed to eat that.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.185
My parents got sick from that.

12:41.186 --> 12:42.858
Don't worry about me, Sheila.

12:42.859 --> 12:46.078
I've eaten snakes,
I've eaten lizards

12:46.079 --> 12:48.987
I've eaten rats on a stick
in the noonday sun.

12:48.988 --> 12:51.734
Old Reptile Rick's
got a cast-iron...

12:54.200 --> 12:55.396
What's in Matilda?

12:55.397 --> 12:56.703
Where's the dunny?
The what-y?

12:56.704 --> 12:58.112
The dunny, the loo.
The who?

12:58.113 --> 12:59.802
The glu... never mind.

13:02.030 --> 13:03.736
Hey, Reptile, can't you just

13:03.737 --> 13:05.264
like, get sick
in front of the kids?

13:05.265 --> 13:07.336
I mean, they love that.

13:09.730 --> 13:10.929
Okay.

13:10.930 --> 13:14.101
Are you all ready
for Reptile Rick?

13:16.959 --> 13:18.490
Well, uh, he's throwing up

13:18.491 --> 13:19.831
so here's Reptile Raven.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.090
Voila.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.094
Iguana.

13:28.772 --> 13:30.598
Do something with it.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.861
# Dancing iguana,
dancing iguana #

13:39.862 --> 13:43.308
# Dancing iguana,
dancing iguana... #

13:47.400 --> 13:50.717
# Peeing iguana,
peeing iguana #

13:50.718 --> 13:52.610
# Peeing iguana #

13:52.611 --> 13:56.134
# Peeing iguana,
peeing iguana #

13:56.135 --> 13:57.432
# Peeing... #

13:59.362 --> 14:01.278
This party stinks.

14:01.279 --> 14:03.200
Where are the snakes?

14:04.138 --> 14:05.574
Snakes? You want snakes?

14:05.575 --> 14:07.303
Well, I'll get you snakes.

14:07.892 --> 14:09.375
But you hate snakes.

14:09.376 --> 14:10.741
Are you kidding me?

14:10.742 --> 14:13.650
Reptile Raven loves snakes.

14:16.434 --> 14:17.705
Oh, I hate snakes.

14:22.130 --> 14:25.096
Not as much as I hate frogs.

14:25.097 --> 14:28.861
Actually, Rae, they're
South American bullfrogs.

14:28.862 --> 14:30.728
And they hate
being in cages.

14:30.729 --> 14:32.225
They were talking to me.

14:32.226 --> 14:33.944
Unlock it.

14:33.945 --> 14:35.628
Unlock it.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.761
What? I just don't want
to step on them.

14:41.762 --> 14:43.339
They're endangered, you know?

14:48.460 --> 14:50.279
What is all
that noise down there?

14:50.280 --> 14:52.030
I don't know, but
I'll go find out.

14:55.060 --> 14:55.824
Oh, my goodness.

14:55.825 --> 14:57.146
My dad's going
to come downstairs.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.588
We got to get rid
of these frogs.

14:58.589 --> 15:00.659
Okay, okay, I got it covered.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.846
Fellas, back
in the cage.

15:03.690 --> 15:06.890
Eddie, stop snapping
and start grabbing. Come on.

15:23.430 --> 15:24.833
Rae?

15:25.250 --> 15:26.711
You down there?

15:33.145 --> 15:35.794
Just came down to see what
all this noise is about.

15:35.795 --> 15:36.664
Noise?

15:36.665 --> 15:38.066
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.015
I'll be sure to keep it down!

15:44.730 --> 15:45.960
How you doing?

15:45.961 --> 15:47.771
You know, are you feeling okay?

15:51.360 --> 15:54.654
Yeah, well, maybe a little
ginger ale will help.

15:58.430 --> 15:59.829
I don't know.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.794
My head's starting to feel
a little clammy.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.654
Do I look okay?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.329
Dad, you look good.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.541
So, but I think I just
need to check your

16:08.542 --> 16:11.333
your fever, so let me
see your head right...

16:12.500 --> 16:13.734
Oh, what's that?

16:13.735 --> 16:14.600
What?

16:16.552 --> 16:17.855
Nothing, nothing.

16:17.856 --> 16:18.747
You're okay.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.204
Is everybody okay?

16:28.865 --> 16:29.714
We're just...

16:29.715 --> 16:31.102
Um, yeah...

16:31.103 --> 16:33.898
feeling the groove,
Mr. Baxter.

16:33.899 --> 16:37.144
Yeah, can you feel it?

16:40.260 --> 16:43.325
Well, um... could you kids
not move so much

16:43.326 --> 16:44.992
because you're
making me

16:44.993 --> 16:45.955
want to...

16:46.892 --> 16:48.392
Oh, I got to go.

16:53.230 --> 16:56.138
Okay, everybody's ready
for the snakes.

16:56.139 --> 16:57.876
This is going to be so cool.

16:57.877 --> 16:59.855
Anything to make
you happy.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.781
Raven Baxter's
modeling this year's

17:13.781 --> 17:14.994
newest fall fashion--

17:14.996 --> 17:16.972
her new line
of boas.

17:16.973 --> 17:18.678
Yes, it's what
every girl should

17:18.679 --> 17:19.967
have around her
neck this year.

17:19.968 --> 17:22.781
And guys, with the
holiday seasons coming up

17:22.782 --> 17:25.085
what better way
to say "I love you"

17:25.086 --> 17:26.317
than a new boa?

17:26.318 --> 17:28.425
Okay, available
in spots and solids

17:28.426 --> 17:30.414
up to 25 feet long,
mice not included.

17:30.415 --> 17:31.874
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.966
Ah! Get it off!

17:35.967 --> 17:38.242
I'm getting it.
I'm getting it off.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.461
Hey, Corey.

17:43.283 --> 17:45.501
Pretty cool snake, huh?

17:46.220 --> 17:47.933
Can't hate me for that.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.173
They're laughing
out there.

17:49.174 --> 17:51.145
Reptile Rick
doesn't model snakes.

17:51.146 --> 17:52.941
He wrestles them.

17:53.657 --> 17:54.768
He does?

18:00.439 --> 18:04.664
And now, for the first time
in these United States

18:04.665 --> 18:06.946
Reptile Raven
will attempt to wrestle

18:06.947 --> 18:10.284
one of the world's
deadliest reptiles.

18:10.285 --> 18:15.626
The Man-eating Anaconda.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.141
All right.

18:37.603 --> 18:39.189
It's a big one.

18:39.190 --> 18:40.706
He's in the box.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.890
He might bite off my arm
or maybe a leg.

18:45.395 --> 18:47.259
You never know.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.472
A chance
you have to take with...

18:52.830 --> 18:54.601
...anacondas.

19:14.096 --> 19:15.699
I think it's dead.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.750
Oh, crikey, it's got me...

19:39.460 --> 19:40.759
It's all right.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.664
I think I've got it.

19:42.665 --> 19:43.630
No, wait!

19:48.960 --> 19:51.658
It's just a stupid
stuffed animal.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.388
It is?

19:58.900 --> 20:01.710
I guess that's why
it hasn't been eating the mice.

20:03.107 --> 20:04.916
This party reeks.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.572
I'm going home.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.194
Who wants to come?

20:08.195 --> 20:09.513
I do.

20:13.403 --> 20:14.933
Corey, wait.

20:16.530 --> 20:18.731
This was the worst party,
and you're the...

20:18.732 --> 20:19.567
Stop.

20:20.314 --> 20:22.085
Okay, I know what
you're going to say.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.477
Come here. Listen.

20:26.118 --> 20:28.864
I know you're going to say
I was the worst sister ever

20:28.865 --> 20:30.365
and you hate me.

20:32.209 --> 20:34.122
And I don't
blame you, okay?

20:34.123 --> 20:36.838
I ruined your birthday,
I always argue with you

20:36.839 --> 20:38.974
and I know I am not
the nicest sister.

20:41.693 --> 20:44.601
But I just don't want us
to stop talking, you know?

20:45.563 --> 20:47.504
I want us to always be friends.

20:48.278 --> 20:50.169
And even though
we fight...

20:51.773 --> 20:53.036
I still love you.

20:55.860 --> 20:56.859
Hey, Baxter.

20:56.860 --> 20:57.972
You got
to come see this.

21:02.809 --> 21:04.629
Ah, see that?

21:04.630 --> 21:05.999
See his little nose?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.129
That's sniffing for milk, aye?

21:08.130 --> 21:10.694
Hey, birthday boy,
take a closer look.

21:10.695 --> 21:13.104
Fanny just had her babies.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.918
This is so cool.

21:14.919 --> 21:16.994
Great party, Baxter.

21:16.995 --> 21:18.665
Really?

21:19.101 --> 21:20.799
So you don't hate me?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.659
Well, I kind of
thought I did

21:22.660 --> 21:24.609
but how many sisters
would do all this

21:24.610 --> 21:25.901
for their little
brother?

21:26.610 --> 21:28.285
So we're okay?

21:28.752 --> 21:30.891
No, we're great.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.629
Well,
I'm all packed up.

21:43.630 --> 21:46.794
I'm glad your party worked out
for you, little fella.

21:46.795 --> 21:49.730
Fanny's going to remember it.
That's for sure.

21:50.755 --> 21:53.555
Now, all I need
is my snake back.

21:53.995 --> 21:55.302
It's in the cage.

21:55.303 --> 21:56.481
What? That?

21:56.482 --> 21:57.429
Oh, no.

21:57.430 --> 21:58.559
That's the baby.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.564
I'm looking for its mama.

22:00.565 --> 22:02.290
The mama?

22:09.430 --> 22:10.827
Raven...
