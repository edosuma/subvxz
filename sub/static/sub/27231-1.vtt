I searched among
my most legendary children

My issue was money.

I came to this competition

03:14.394 --> 03:15.529
Very Oz-mopolitan.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.604
Now, when I look at you
as a model--

03:24.604 --> 03:25.939
You're gonna take
great photos,

03:25.939 --> 03:28.875
but that does not take talent.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.011
Even though I made it
all the way to the Top Three,

03:31.011 --> 03:32.846
a lot of people still think

03:32.846 --> 03:35.115
I'm just a tall,
pretty fashion model.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.517
- You're gorgeous!
- A goddess!

03:37.517 --> 03:39.953
So I'm going to seize
this opportunity

03:39.953 --> 03:41.254
to show the world

03:41.254 --> 03:43.090
that I'm not just
this beauty queen.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.525
There's only one crown
and it's mine.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.327
- Damn her waist.
- Thank you.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.297
I don't really know
what to expect of Naomi.

03:50.297 --> 03:53.400
she's beautiful, young,
creative.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.370
But Naomi doesn't have
a very big personality,

03:57.370 --> 03:59.873
and you either stand out
or you get out.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.074
Thank God you're pretty.

04:02.742 --> 04:06.046
Guess who's black
in the house, bitch. Yes!

04:06.046 --> 04:08.782

04:08.782 --> 04:10.984

Miss Congeniality.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.085
I am here to slay,

04:12.085 --> 04:13.687
and until I snatch that crown,

04:13.687 --> 04:16.790
a bitch brought her own. Ooh.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.725
Soak it up, bitches!

In Season 10, I thought
I was going all the way,

04:26.700 --> 04:27.801
and I was really surprised

04:27.801 --> 04:30.237
that I didn't win
any challenges.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.339
The look seems homemade.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.607
Really sloppy.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.875
If I could go back in time,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.977
the one thing that I would
change from my season

04:36.977 --> 04:39.846
would be my rickety-crickety
runway girl

04:39.846 --> 04:40.847
so I could have
some challenge wins.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.115
I want a challenge win.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.085
- Yes! Yes!
- You are a nasty queen.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.420
I'm excited to see
my Season 10 sister.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.890
I feel like both of us
have something to prove.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.192
But this is "All Stars" 4.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.561
A black jumpsuit
like a leotard?

04:54.561 --> 04:55.829
It's not stunning.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.899

04:58.899 --> 05:01.101
Step aside, boys,

05:01.101 --> 05:04.538
'cause the real queen is here.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.040
My name is Gia Gunn,
I'm from Season 6,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.443

05:10.443 --> 05:12.212

05:17.450 --> 05:18.552

05:18.552 --> 05:20.587
My God,
there's room for everybody.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.556
I could tell
that you're the feisty one.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.823
Absolutely.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.659
There's still a big percentage
of the world

05:25.659 --> 05:27.060
who thinks that Gia Gunn

05:27.060 --> 05:29.930
is the "absolutely, let me
feel my oats," shady character.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.466
But since Season 6,
I did a huge self discovery

05:33.466 --> 05:37.571
and drag was the gateway
for me to realize

05:37.571 --> 05:40.941
that I am not a man
that dresses up as a woman.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.877
I'm a woman that participates
in the art of drag.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.478
Y'all got the same look.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.314
Uh-uh. She got
a crown of thorns on.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.616
That means we about
to crucify her real soon.

05:49.616 --> 05:54.254
It feels amazing
to be back in the workroom

05:54.254 --> 05:56.656
as the proud trans-woman
that I am.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.392
So get ready,
because she's here.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.794
Yes, God.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.729
Thank God I didn't add
any more roses.

06:02.729 --> 06:03.863
[all laugh]

06:03.863 --> 06:05.732
Her look
may be similar to mine,

06:05.732 --> 06:07.434
but, honey,
there's a big difference.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.770
Mine is couture
and hers is just hot glue.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.139
I saw you on "Botched."

06:13.139 --> 06:15.408
- Yeah, girl.
- Yes, yes, you did.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.110
I just saw a monster.
I said, that's my sister.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.913
Ooh! No!

06:19.913 --> 06:23.450
Girl, Gia's
gonna let everybody have it.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.652
She is shady.
She's not the same person.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.653
She's worse.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.537
I'm Farrah Moan

my way to the top, honey.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.442
Oh.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.578
- Farrah Moan.
- I like the peek-a-boobs.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.513
Are you feeling lucky?
On Season 9,

06:53.513 --> 06:56.616
I felt prematurely cast
only because I was so young.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.219
No. I don't want
to do this.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.687
She whines
like a six-year-old.

07:00.687 --> 07:01.755
She knows she's a cute girl,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.123
but there's nothing more
than that yet.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.357
Oh.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.660
I think a lot of people
still see me

07:06.660 --> 07:10.664
as this scared, whiney,
little 22-year-old girl,

07:10.664 --> 07:12.198
But I just want to show people

07:12.198 --> 07:15.669
that I am now
a ferocious, fierce

07:15.669 --> 07:17.804
25-year-old. [laughs]

07:19.606 --> 07:21.074

07:21.074 --> 07:24.644
Farrah Moan is one of the most
stunning queens I've ever seen.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.447
She has more Instagram followers
than a lot of these bitches do.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.216
Aah! Oh, my God,
y'all look so good.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.885
Miss Farrah is gorgeous.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.186
Let's tell facts.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.323
But, America,
if you gonna have your ass out,

07:36.323 --> 07:39.826
it's supposed to look like J-Lo,
not like Mr. Rogers.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.562
I see that they went
straight from 8 to 6,

07:42.562 --> 07:43.630
so we're skipping 7.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.597
Let's all praise the Lord
for that.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.733
- Pages.
- Oh.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.739
I am Jasmine Masters
and I have something to say.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.107
Oh!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.546
For those of you
who don't remember me,

07:59.546 --> 08:01.147
I was on Season 7.

08:01.147 --> 08:05.218
Jasmine Masters, your
personality is off the hook.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.020
Where did you get
a loaf of bread?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.289
[all laugh]

08:09.289 --> 08:10.890
Watch out, sisters. Oh.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.992
- Head cheerleader.
- Head--head cheerleader.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.296
I've never seen a car crash
like this before.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.797
I don't want to hear
any goddamn excuses?

08:17.797 --> 08:19.899
Be prepared!

08:19.899 --> 08:22.102
- Aah!
- Aah!

08:22.102 --> 08:23.937
- Oh, my God!
- How you been?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.239
There's a lot of queens,
a lot of fans out there

08:26.239 --> 08:28.041
who don't believe
that I'm a great drag queen.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.809
But since I've been on the show,

08:29.809 --> 08:31.678
I became the mean queen,

08:31.678 --> 08:34.581
and I'm always in
somebody's video or clip.

08:34.581 --> 08:35.782
You know, I don't understand

08:35.782 --> 08:37.050
why people's breath
be motherfucker's stink

08:37.050 --> 08:38.385
and they don't taste it.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.254
Because when you go... [chomp]
you don't taste that?

08:41.254 --> 08:44.991
The mean queen is back
to snatch the crown.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.092
Oh, look at you,
You're still beautiful.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.560
You tall bitch,
get out of my face.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.296
I'm glad to see
Jasmine Masters back

08:50.296 --> 08:53.199
because she did so poorly
on her season.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.902
But that bitch fucking
dug herself out of a grave

08:55.902 --> 08:58.471
with those Vines
and Instagram videos,

08:58.471 --> 08:59.906
and the bitch is so funny.

08:59.906 --> 09:02.175
- So you were Season 7.
- Yes.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.410
That's the season
you wanted to skip.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.911
- Oh, really?
- Well, what I--

09:04.911 --> 09:07.247
But if anybody,
at least we got Jasmine.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.582
- You know what I mean?
- What is there from Season 7

09:09.582 --> 09:12.352
that we were not
looking forward to seeing?

09:12.352 --> 09:15.555
Season 7 was a pretty boring
fucking season,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.223
and Season 9,
y'all were next on the list.

09:17.223 --> 09:21.060
Wait a minute.
No. No, bitch.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.128
I call shade, bitch.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.097
Everyone thinks
that their season

09:24.097 --> 09:25.165
was the best of the best,

09:25.165 --> 09:27.667
but Monet
ain't got half the talent

09:27.667 --> 09:30.503
that the girls
from Season 9 have, honey.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.806
Season 9 is about to slay.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.874
Season 9 was just fine, okay?

09:34.874 --> 09:37.844
Fan favorite is here.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.145
Oh, shit.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.880
- Ha!
- No.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.083
Brbrbrbrbr.
I'm back.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.351
It's you, Valentina.

09:45.351 --> 09:48.154
I'm glamour, high fashion,

09:48.154 --> 09:49.656
a Latin-American diva.

09:49.656 --> 09:53.493
And this is the Valentina
confessional look 2.0.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.727
Shush.

09:54.727 --> 09:58.098
We have a beautiful
designer beret by Dior,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.899
and look at this manicure.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.534
I'm ready for my closeup.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.636
- Aw...
- Aw...

10:03.636 --> 10:05.205
Linda Evangelista.
I like it.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.041
Stop. Take that thing
off of your mouth.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.476
I'd like to keep it on,
please.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.078
It's a lip sync. What part
of that do you not understand?

10:12.078 --> 10:14.013
After my elimination
on Season 9,

10:14.013 --> 10:17.150
I felt the weight
of being a failure.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.853
But eventually
I took it as motivation.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.288
And since my season,

10:22.288 --> 10:23.857
I've had the opportunities

10:23.857 --> 10:25.692
of working with
a man from "Vogue,"

10:25.692 --> 10:27.293
"Vogue Mexico."

10:27.293 --> 10:29.462
And I don't really intend
on being known forever

10:29.462 --> 10:32.165
as the person that
doesn't know how to lip sync.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.233
Let's do a conga line.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.767
♪ Dee dee dee dee dee da ♪

10:34.767 --> 10:36.603
♪ Dee dee dee dee dee da ♪

10:36.603 --> 10:38.538
I'm surprised you know
the words to that song.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.273
- Oh!
- Well, girl, whatever.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.943
I feel good.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.512
We were a close-knit season,

10:45.512 --> 10:47.013
despite the reunion.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.448
[all laugh]

10:48.448 --> 10:50.183
We were such close friends,

10:50.183 --> 10:53.453
and you have not spoken to me
in almost five months.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.587
Text me, call me.
Let's talk about it.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.856
I have texted you.
You ignore my texts.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.758
I respect you and love you.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.393
You don't love me.

11:00.393 --> 11:04.330
I know that everybody wants
the fun little telenovela,

11:04.330 --> 11:06.266
"Valentina vs. Farrah,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.334
You Don't Love Me" fantasy.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.171
However, she's apologized,
I've apologized,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.339
and I feel like
we're on the route

11:13.339 --> 11:15.041
to a better relationship.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.509
Do you even have
her phone number?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.710
Yeah.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.245
She's texted me back now.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.014
[laughs]

11:21.014 --> 11:24.450
In the eyes of some,
I am Miss Congeniality.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.321
And in the eyes of other people,
I'm a snake.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.890
But I just know I'm both

11:30.890 --> 11:32.225
because I know
I can be really nice,

11:32.225 --> 11:34.360
but I've always loved
the villain.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.663
[evil laugh]

11:36.663 --> 11:37.664
So wait, you guys.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.866
Do you think
this is all of the cast?

11:39.866 --> 11:40.867
No, there's more girls.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.101
How many trophies is it?

11:42.101 --> 11:43.636
Eight is too little.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.471
There's no way there's
just eight of us girls.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.006
[alarm]
Uh-oh.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.809
You bullshitting, you
bullshitting, you bullshitting.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.411
Ooh, girl.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.480
She done already
done had herses.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.349
- Aw...
- Come on, bitch.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.952
Hey, hennies.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.188
The moment
you strutted through that door

12:02.188 --> 12:04.224
your fate changed forever.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.126
You're no longer mere mortals.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.429
You're super queens,

12:09.429 --> 12:10.997
and if you can harness the power

12:10.997 --> 12:14.534
of your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent,

12:14.534 --> 12:17.637
you'll rule
the Drag Race Hall of Fame

12:17.637 --> 12:20.039
from here to eternity.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.375
Now, who the fuck is Heather?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.844
[all laugh]

12:24.844 --> 12:27.814
Hello, hello, hello.

12:27.814 --> 12:31.484
[cheers and laughter]

12:31.484 --> 12:33.486
Hey, super queens, welcome back.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.788
- Hey!
- Hey!

12:35.788 --> 12:37.690
Now, out of all the queens
in the world,

12:37.690 --> 12:40.093
I've invited the eight of you
to return.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.394
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

12:41.394 --> 12:45.198
Because each of you possess
a unique super power

12:45.198 --> 12:47.267
that puts you
in a league of your own.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.334
Yes, ma'am.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.970
All Star rules
are in full effect.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.272
Each week, the top two queens

12:53.272 --> 12:55.575
will lip sync for their legacy,

12:55.575 --> 12:59.946
and the winner will receive
a $10.000 tip.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.715
- Whoo!
- $10.000, yeah!

13:02.715 --> 13:05.485
Plus, the power to eliminate

13:05.485 --> 13:08.921
one of her fellow All Stars.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.823
Now, this is your chance
to prove

13:10.823 --> 13:15.361
that you can compete
with the best of the best.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.296
And at the end of the day,

13:17.296 --> 13:20.500
if you slay,
you'll earn your way

13:20.500 --> 13:23.069
into the Drag Race Hall of Fame

13:23.069 --> 13:26.773
and a cash prize of $100.000.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.307
[cheering]

13:28.307 --> 13:31.344
Now, there may be a twist.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.046
Of course.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.647
- Or two.
- Oh!

13:34.647 --> 13:37.350
So without further ado,

13:37.350 --> 13:39.285
please welcome Team...

13:40.653 --> 13:42.288

13:42.288 --> 13:44.357

Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:46.559 --> 13:50.263
[cheering]

13:50.263 --> 13:53.666
Latrila is back in the house.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.769
The bitches
are handcuffed together,

13:56.769 --> 13:59.639
and I'm like, not teams,
not teams, not teams.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.274
We all saw how "All Stars" 1
turned out.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.543
Everyone competed in teams,

14:03.543 --> 14:05.478
and if this is teams again,
I'm done.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.714
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:07.714 --> 14:08.981
I know I'm stunning,

14:08.981 --> 14:11.818
but just 'cause I'm fabulous

14:11.818 --> 14:13.386
don't mean I'm gonna be paired
with somebody fabulous.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.687
Twist, honey.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.522
Why y'all gagging so?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.124
I still don't get
what's going on.

chunky and funky
Latrice motherfucking Royale.

Eat it.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.414
Look at Manila-nila-nila.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.183
I'm Manila Luzon.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.384
I'm the runnerup from Season 3,

15:18.384 --> 15:21.754
and something-up
from "All Stars" 1.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.922
On your own,

15:22.922 --> 15:26.192
none of you
were able to reach the top.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.027
So this time around,

15:28.027 --> 15:31.030
you'll be competing
as teams of two.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.331
- [laughs]
- Shit.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.867
When we did "All Stars" 1
in teams,

15:34.867 --> 15:38.004
it was the gagger
because we weren't expecting

15:38.004 --> 15:41.007
to have to work with someone
the entire season.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.775
Latrila.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.911
This has been like
the best pairing in the world

15:44.911 --> 15:47.079
because like you always know
how to take it

15:47.079 --> 15:51.017
that extra step beyond,
and I love that.

15:51.017 --> 15:54.287
Manila and Latrice,
sashay away.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.990
This time
is gonna be different.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.060
Now, ladies,
Latrice and Manila

16:01.060 --> 16:05.865
competed as a team
in the first "All Stars."

16:05.865 --> 16:09.802
But I invited them back
to compete as individuals.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.504
[cheering]

16:11.504 --> 16:14.273
[laughter and applause]

16:14.273 --> 16:16.309
- [sighs]
- Whoo, girls!

16:16.309 --> 16:20.012
I am very relieved
that it's not a team situation.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.415
But at the same time,
having Latrice and Manila here,

16:22.415 --> 16:24.217
things literally just got
three times harder.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.453
They are two of the most
fierce competitors

16:27.453 --> 16:28.688
in "Drag Race" history.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.256
Game on.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.426
Now that all 10 All Stars
have arrived,

16:33.426 --> 16:35.428
I'd like to celebrate.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.963
- Ooh.
- Yay!

16:36.963 --> 16:39.332
Oh, Pit Crew.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.434
[cheering]

16:41.434 --> 16:42.435
Oh, yes!

16:42.435 --> 16:45.371
And the bulge is real. Yes.

16:45.371 --> 16:49.308
In the great tradition
of "Paris Is Burning," darling,

16:49.308 --> 16:51.611
the library
is about to be opened.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.679
Because reading is what?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.114
[all] Fundamental.

16:55.114 --> 16:58.317
That's right,
especially with fabulous frames

16:58.317 --> 17:00.653
from l.a. Eyeworks.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.723
All right, first up,
Monet X Change.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.126
Ooh. RuPaul,
but I'm Miss Congeniality.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.028
I could never...

17:09.028 --> 17:11.264
[deep voice] Here we go, bitch.
[all laugh]

17:11.264 --> 17:12.431
Tiffany The Tuck,

17:12.431 --> 17:15.067
you've had so much plastic
in you,

17:15.067 --> 17:16.302
you won't be buried in a coffin.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.904
You'll probably be buried
in a recycling bin.

17:17.904 --> 17:21.274
[all laugh]

17:21.274 --> 17:22.975
Manila Luzon.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.110
Emphasis on lose.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.778
- Oh...
- Twice.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.647
[all laugh]

17:27.647 --> 17:29.982
Monet X Change.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.384
The sponge queen.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.885
Yes.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.453
Too bad
you couldn't soak up a win.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.621
[laughs]

17:35.621 --> 17:36.923
Oh!

17:36.923 --> 17:39.425
Ru, thank you so much
for bringing someone here

17:39.425 --> 17:41.227
that's going to make me
look smart.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.228
What's up, Farrah Moan?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.163
[all laugh]

17:44.163 --> 17:45.331
Farrah Moan is so dumb,

17:45.331 --> 17:47.266
she thought Valentina
was her best friend.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.635
Ooh!

17:49.635 --> 17:51.237
Oh, my God.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.373
Naomi Smalls,
legs you are known for.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.008
However, you should
be known for toes,

17:56.008 --> 17:56.943
'cause they're always
hanging out.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.110
Oh!

17:58.110 --> 17:59.745
Just like you
in that nineties video, Ru,

17:59.745 --> 18:00.980
you know, when you
were in the bodega?

18:00.980 --> 18:01.981
Oh!

18:01.981 --> 18:03.316
Security.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.750
[all laugh]

18:04.750 --> 18:07.053
Monet X Change.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.221
Now I know why
you have your name.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.623
You look so cheap,
it looks like

18:10.623 --> 18:13.359
you've broken your piggy bank
for some change.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.594
[laughs]

18:14.594 --> 18:16.128
For workshopping,
good to know.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.030
Trinity Taylor.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.866
When is the second
nose job planned?

18:20.866 --> 18:23.235
I think you could still cut
a little bit more of her off.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.471
You should tell that
to your ass.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.441
[all laugh]

18:28.441 --> 18:29.642
[laughs]

18:29.642 --> 18:31.844
G-G-G-Gia Gunn.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.680
I guess you can
buy a Gunn at Walmart.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.282
[all laugh]

18:36.282 --> 18:38.884
Jasmine Masters,
you know what--oh!

18:38.884 --> 18:40.319
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

18:40.319 --> 18:42.154
I'm sorry. I was just
looking for her talent.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.890
[all laugh]

18:44.890 --> 18:48.561
Monique Heart,
you brag so much

18:48.561 --> 18:51.497
about how you make
your own clothes,

18:51.497 --> 18:54.533
but your dresses are so ugly,
they hang themselves.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.801
[all laugh]

18:55.801 --> 18:57.670
Tell.

18:57.670 --> 19:02.041
Manila Luzon, I loved you
so much on your season.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.076
But who's a booger now,
bitch?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.645
[all laugh]

19:06.645 --> 19:07.880
It's me, guys.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.683
All right, all right,
you janky whores.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.686
Latrice Royale.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.354
You are my sister, bitch.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.256
I liked it better
when you was my bodyguard.

19:17.256 --> 19:20.159
[all laugh]

19:20.159 --> 19:22.094
- And Ru.
- Uh-huh?

19:22.094 --> 19:24.230
Thank you
for having me back, bitch.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.698
I want my suit back.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.299
[all laugh]

19:27.299 --> 19:32.038
Trinity The Tuck, was that
legal or illegal silicone,

19:32.038 --> 19:34.673
and whose kitchen table
did you get done on?

19:34.673 --> 19:35.841
I'll give you
my doctor's number.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.676
I don't wanna die.
Thank you.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.945
[all laugh]

19:39.945 --> 19:42.048
Miss Farrah Moan.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.650
Sweets, if I was as untalented

19:44.650 --> 19:47.586
and unoriginal as you are,

19:47.586 --> 19:49.555
I too would invest
everything I had

19:49.555 --> 19:52.858
in looking like somebody
more famous than I.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.062
Okay.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.398
Naomi Smalls,
legs, legs, legs.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.000
Could we get
a side of brains with that?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.134
[all laugh]

20:02.134 --> 20:06.205
Valentina, take that thing
off your face.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.141
Oh. It is your face.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.343
[all laugh]

20:11.343 --> 20:12.378
Your other one.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.547
Oh! Damn.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.682
[all laugh]

20:16.682 --> 20:17.817
Jasmine, say it's true.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.885
You got a key
to my house, bitch.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.787
Girl, welcome to a season

20:21.787 --> 20:23.355
that somebody
will give a shit about.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.757
[all laugh]

20:24.757 --> 20:26.559
That's how it's done, ladies.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.760
That's how it's done.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.296
Monet X Change,
I'm sure you get compared

20:30.296 --> 20:32.998
to Bob the Drag Queen
all the time.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.967
And in this competition,
that's a good thing,

20:34.967 --> 20:38.170
because at least you know
you'll beat Naomi Smalls.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.972
Oh-ho-ho. [laughs]

20:39.972 --> 20:42.007
A two-for-one read.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.810
Monique Heart,
do you remove your makeup

20:44.810 --> 20:46.479
with flushable toilet wipes?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.380
Because you're an ass
and your makeup is shit.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.684
[all laugh]

20:51.684 --> 20:53.018
All right now.

20:53.018 --> 20:56.655
The library is closed
officially.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.959
And, ooh, child,
I'm gonna need some aloe

20:59.959 --> 21:02.294
for all them burns.

21:02.294 --> 21:05.164
But the winner of today's
mini challenge is...

21:06.899 --> 21:08.934
Latrice Royale.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.203
[laughter and applause]

21:11.203 --> 21:12.938
Con-drag-ulations.

21:12.938 --> 21:17.576
You've won a $2.500 gift card
from l.a. Eyeworks.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.779
I'm the ultimate reader,
bitch.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.213
I won it on my season,

21:21.213 --> 21:22.715
and I won it here.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.217
So if anybody had a doubt

21:25.217 --> 21:27.119
of why I am back,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.355
here's your answer.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.290
And I'll be posting
more of your reads

21:31.290 --> 21:33.926
at RuPaulsDragRace.com.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.661
#AllStars4.

21:35.661 --> 21:38.631
Ladies, since appearing
on "Drag Race,"

21:38.631 --> 21:40.766
you've served
as ambassadors of drag

21:40.766 --> 21:42.635
around the world.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.870
Now it's time to see

21:44.870 --> 21:49.942
how your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent has grown.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.277
For this week's maxi challenge,

21:51.277 --> 21:55.915
you'll be headlining an All Star
Spangled Variety Show.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.150
[cheering]

21:58.150 --> 22:00.953
And you'll be showcasing
your best talent

22:00.953 --> 22:03.556
to entertain a patriotic mix

22:03.556 --> 22:08.327
of LGBTQ veterans
and active service people.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.962
- Oh.
- Ooh.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.231
Maybe I'll find
my straight military husband.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.832
Except for it's LGBTQ.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.234
Oh.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.536
That was the key word.

22:17.536 --> 22:20.773
So my fellow drag Americans,

22:20.773 --> 22:25.911
start your engines
and may the best All Star win.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.680
- Whoo!
- Ow!

22:27.680 --> 22:28.914
- Oh!
- Whoo!

22:28.914 --> 22:29.949
Claim!

22:29.949 --> 22:31.050
Bitch, my nails
is there already.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.184
My nails is on the counter.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.119
I lost a nail.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.222
It's okay, it's okay.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.457
That's not the only thing
you're gonna lose.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.125
[laughs] Oh, my God.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.027
Heave!

22:42.027 --> 22:43.429
Latrice and Manila.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.496
That's the gag of the season.

22:44.496 --> 22:45.865
It really is.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.967
It's so wild

22:47.967 --> 22:50.502
being on the same season
with legends,

22:50.502 --> 22:52.905
but I can't let that admiration

22:52.905 --> 22:55.107
get in the way
of my performance.

22:55.107 --> 22:58.010
Because I know I can outperform
these bitches

22:58.010 --> 23:00.246
who've been at this shit
since before I was born.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.480
[laughs]

23:01.480 --> 23:03.249
It's so nuts to be here
on the same season as you.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.416
You are a legend.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.018
- Yeah, girl.
- Thank you. That's so cool.

23:06.018 --> 23:09.755
I mean, I remember
when I first met Lady Bunny

23:09.755 --> 23:11.156
when I first moved
to New York City.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.558
You're my Lady Bunny.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.995
[all laugh]

23:15.995 --> 23:17.096
Oh, my gosh.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.699
Lady Bunny is old
as a dinosaur, okay?

23:20.699 --> 23:23.135
Uh, thank you, I guess.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.704
That's okay.
I have longevity, okay, girl?

23:25.704 --> 23:26.805
Read between the lines.

23:26.805 --> 23:27.773
We'll talk to you
in a couple years

23:27.773 --> 23:29.041
and see where you at.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.209
Read between the lines
on your forehead, darling.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.711
[all laugh]

23:32.711 --> 23:33.913
You know what?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.649
You are the reason why
I wear highlight now.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.217
- That should be your talent.
- It is.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.954
Oh, my God. That's great.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.089
I wanna show something
that's my brand,

23:44.089 --> 23:46.225
so I've put together

23:46.225 --> 23:48.560
a tucking tutorial.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.029
[laughs]

23:50.029 --> 23:52.731
I want to show you
that I can be funny

23:52.731 --> 23:55.467
and still teach you
how to tuck.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.736
That's never been done
on the show.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.039
You do have to take risks
if you want to win.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.209
No. Well, just the song,

24:04.209 --> 24:05.444
'cause it's
"Brown Cow Stunning."

24:05.444 --> 24:06.512
This is for something else.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.247
For my performance,

24:08.247 --> 24:11.750
I decided to debut my song
"Brown Cow Stunning,"

24:11.750 --> 24:13.752
and sing live
because last time

24:13.752 --> 24:16.055
I went home right before
the singing challenge.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.257
So this time, oh, honey.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.160
trust I'm gonna give you
the ooh-ah-ah sensation.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.361
Trust.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.963
[clicks tongue]
♪ La vaca, moo ♪

24:24.963 --> 24:27.566
- What does it mean?
- La vaca means the cow.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.967
♪ Moo, the cow, moo ♪

24:28.967 --> 24:30.602
Aah, yes!

24:30.602 --> 24:33.872
Brown cow stunning.

24:33.872 --> 24:37.943
Uh, I don't know how stunning
it's really gonna be.

24:37.943 --> 24:39.378
I'm excited to see
what we're all doing.

24:39.378 --> 24:40.713
I know.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.325
We're gonna find out.
Hopefully it's not comedy.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.960
I doubt that.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.662
I'm uncertain about how I feel

24:56.662 --> 24:59.098
with Farrah here
in the competition.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.733
I'm a little bit worried for her

25:00.733 --> 25:03.068
because I don't really think
that she's an All Star.

25:03.068 --> 25:06.972
I don't think that she
is anything more past Instagram,

25:06.972 --> 25:09.441
and this is a place
for legends, okay?

25:14.813 --> 25:16.382
Okay!

25:16.382 --> 25:17.583
Here we go, girls.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.017
Here we are!

25:19.017 --> 25:21.487
Today we're getting ready
for our first maxi challenge,

25:21.487 --> 25:24.790
an All Star
Spangled Variety Show.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.526
All right, y'all.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.328
Yes, get into the outfits.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.462
Yes!

25:30.462 --> 25:32.564
- Model.
- Always being a diva.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.199
[all laugh]

25:34.199 --> 25:35.501
[laughs]

25:35.501 --> 25:37.069
Latrice!

25:37.069 --> 25:39.838
You guys are interrupting
my outfit moment.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.775
- Are you excited, bitch?
- I am!

25:42.775 --> 25:46.011
I'm nervous. Very excited,
but nervous, girl.

25:46.011 --> 25:47.012
What are you
most nervous about?

25:47.012 --> 25:47.946
I don't know.

25:47.946 --> 25:49.248
What if the judges don't think

25:49.248 --> 25:50.582
that what you think
is your talent is your talent?

25:50.582 --> 25:51.750
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.386
"All Stars"
is a very different game.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.454
The stakes are higher.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.122
The chances
that you can go home

25:57.122 --> 25:59.191
for a tiny fumble
are greater.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.427
I'm trying to put these on
so I don't slip and fall, girl.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.061
You know
that is the kiss of death.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.998
Like you're done.
Game over. Career's ended.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.299
Goodbye.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.169
Honey, "Brown Cow Stunning"
is gonna get debuted.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.937
- Yes.
- I'm so excited.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.839
- Good for you.
- I am gonna do standup.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.040
Yes?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.542
Yeah. It's just like,
bitch, gimme the mic.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.744
I'm gonna talk some shit.
We gonna have a good time.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.146
I have always been told,
from very young,

26:21.146 --> 26:22.347
"Ha ha, you're so funny."

26:22.347 --> 26:23.949
Just saying
whatever I need to say.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.017
But I've just been myself.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.685
The women love me,
the men love me,

26:26.685 --> 26:28.887
the kids love me,
the cats, the dogs, the mice.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.556
Everybody love me, so...

26:30.556 --> 26:32.858
Guess what?
Up in the ring, bitch.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.593
Did you write or are you
just gonna go off the cuff?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.795
I'm just gonna go off of it.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.364
I figure
if I write something down...

26:39.364 --> 26:40.732
- Uh-huh.
- I will forget it,

26:40.732 --> 26:41.733
'cause I'm trying
to stay here.

26:41.733 --> 26:42.768
Oh.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.236
You know, this is not like,

26:44.236 --> 26:46.638
oh, you gotta learn this script
and these words.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.207
But what if it's
more like a skeleton?

26:48.207 --> 26:49.608
You know what I mean?
An outline.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.411
So that way you always know

and when he called me back
for another one,

39:04.475 --> 39:07.045
I said, "Hell no."
And he asked me why.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.179
I said, "'Cause, baby,

I need you to fix that.

43:39.917 --> 43:41.352
In your season,

43:41.352 --> 43:43.054
you didn't think
that you were funny

43:43.054 --> 43:45.256
until we had Sister Mary Koont,

43:45.256 --> 43:47.592
and then you started
to break out of your shell.

43:47.592 --> 43:48.793
So I am so grateful

43:48.793 --> 43:51.262
that you chose tonight
to start with comedy.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.764
Just one directorial note.

43:53.764 --> 43:54.966
You had that great prop

43:54.966 --> 43:56.801
of going behind
that little dressing screen.

43:56.801 --> 43:57.935
And when you come out,

43:57.935 --> 44:00.171
I would have liked
a bigger bang.

But beautiful can get kind of
boring after a while.

44:35.439 --> 44:40.178
The best part about this
wasn't how gorgeous you looked.

44:40.178 --> 44:42.013
It was the weird part

44:42.013 --> 44:43.548
when you popped that wig off

kind of their bread and butter

45:45.243 --> 45:49.080
because I know
you were so nervous.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.749
It just didn't really happen
how I had dreamed of it.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.618
Like I just wanted everything
to be perfect,

45:53.618 --> 45:56.387

45:58.189 --> 46:02.493
You have everything it takes
to win this whole thing,

but not if you can't
summon the confidence.

because you are very funny.

46:27.852 --> 46:30.121
Those jokes just kind of
weren't landing.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.889
Did you prepare that at all?

46:31.889 --> 46:33.357
Well, I knew
what I was going to say

46:33.357 --> 46:35.059
because I went off
my bad breath video.

46:35.059 --> 46:36.794
But was it planned
when you did the video?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.629
- No. No.
- No.

46:38.629 --> 46:39.897
I know exactly what happened
with you tonight.

46:39.897 --> 46:41.632
I'm a funny person, too, right,

46:41.632 --> 46:43.367
and I think I'm funniest
when I'm off the cuff.

46:43.367 --> 46:44.635
That's why that video went viral

46:44.635 --> 46:47.004
because it was hilarious
and it was so authentic.

46:47.004 --> 46:50.241
But doing standup
is a different thing.

46:50.241 --> 46:52.043
- Mm-hmm.
- It's gotta be flawless,

46:52.043 --> 46:53.878

and you lose us.

Yeah!

47:31.215 --> 47:33.384
Naomi Smalls,

Monet X Change,

47:35.553 --> 47:36.787
you are both safe.

47:39.824 --> 47:43.694
That means Farrah Moan
and Jasmine Masters,

47:43.694 --> 47:46.664
you are in the bottom two.

47:48.899 --> 47:51.969
I came here with such
high expectations for myself,

47:51.969 --> 47:54.638
and it's hard for me
not to feel like

47:54.638 --> 47:57.174
I just don't have it in me
or something.

47:57.174 --> 48:01.312
How can you go from being so
confident and proud of yourself

48:01.312 --> 48:03.647
to feeling so small?

48:05.082 --> 48:08.452
Monique and Trinity,
each of you needs to decide

48:08.452 --> 48:12.356
which of the bottom two
you will eliminate

48:12.356 --> 48:14.625
if you win the lip sync.

48:14.625 --> 48:18.896
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

48:18.896 --> 48:22.800
the judges and I will be
tooting our own horns.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.237
You may leave the stage.

48:30.007 --> 48:32.109
- Oh, girl.
- I'm getting a drink.

48:32.109 --> 48:34.178
It feels great
to be in the top two.

48:34.178 --> 48:35.646
This shows right out the gate

48:35.646 --> 48:38.449
who is competition
and who is not.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.684
Girl, this is
the first elimination.

48:40.684 --> 48:42.319
- I know.
- I want to win,

48:42.319 --> 48:45.456
but then again, like, winning,

48:45.456 --> 48:47.525
you have to send someone home.

48:47.525 --> 48:50.928
Someone's dreams are
about to be crushed forever.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.063
- Not forever, honey.
- No.

48:53.063 --> 48:55.166
We're on "All Stars"
because we're All Stars.

48:55.166 --> 48:56.901
- Yeah.
- That's never going to go away.

48:56.901 --> 48:59.904
The real T, you can say
we're all All Stars,

48:59.904 --> 49:01.572
but when you are going home,
packing up your stuff,

49:01.572 --> 49:03.107
it doesn't feel like that,
you know what I mean?

49:03.107 --> 49:05.109
It feels like shit.

49:05.109 --> 49:06.877
How do you feel, Jasmine?

49:06.877 --> 49:08.679
You can't say
that I wasn't funny.

49:08.679 --> 49:11.482
You may not like
what I was saying,

49:11.482 --> 49:14.218
but you cannot say
I wasn't funny.

49:14.218 --> 49:16.487
Jasmine does not get it
at all.

49:16.487 --> 49:20.891
She refuses to take any
responsibility for her faults

49:20.891 --> 49:22.393
and fucking up her talent.

49:22.393 --> 49:26.063
I was so excited
about this number.

49:26.063 --> 49:28.065
Like, I've literally dreamt
of this number

49:28.065 --> 49:29.466
ever since I started doing drag.

49:29.466 --> 49:30.901
Maybe one day
I'll be able to afford

49:30.901 --> 49:33.370
to be as sparkly and beautiful
as I've always dreamed of.

49:33.370 --> 49:36.607
I'm going to cry again.

49:36.607 --> 49:39.510
This crying,
let me get her lipstick,

49:39.510 --> 49:41.879
'cause I'm not doing it.

49:41.879 --> 49:44.315
You a grown-ass man.

49:44.315 --> 49:47.284
Girl, I'll talk to you
over there, honey.

49:51.155 --> 49:53.090
I love you,
but your crying annoys me.

49:53.090 --> 49:57.294
If you continue on, sis, like
you gotta be, like, do or die.

49:57.294 --> 49:58.562
Like in that fall,

49:58.562 --> 50:00.664
I would have loved
if you would have just posed.

50:03.801 --> 50:07.037
I get it.
We all have those moments.

50:07.037 --> 50:09.907
Beyonce. We saw the video.

50:09.907 --> 50:13.978
Ring the alarm, bla-ka-ka-ka,
she fell down them stairs.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.679
But you get up.
You hold it.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.415
It's not that you fell.
It's how you fell.

50:18.415 --> 50:21.352
All I want
is to just be the best.

50:21.352 --> 50:26.123
And I want
to fucking just...do it.

50:26.123 --> 50:27.825
That's what I want.
That right there,

50:27.825 --> 50:29.693
I would like to see her
more often.

50:29.693 --> 50:32.463
Sis, if you are here...

50:32.463 --> 50:33.797
Because if you fuck up again,

50:33.797 --> 50:34.899
I'm going to send you home
personally.

50:34.899 --> 50:37.201
I'm telling you that
to your face.

50:37.201 --> 50:40.905
Why should you stay
and not your counterpart?

50:40.905 --> 50:42.640
She breaks down too much.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.208
Every little thing go wrong,

50:44.208 --> 50:45.609
she just gonna
keep breaking down

50:45.609 --> 50:47.244
and breaking down
and breaking down.

50:47.244 --> 50:48.445
- Right, okay.
- And this is "All Stars."

50:48.445 --> 50:50.881
I want to eliminate
the weakest link,

50:50.881 --> 50:53.484
because if I'm going
to be the best,

50:53.484 --> 50:55.152
- I want to beat the best.
- Beat the best.

50:55.152 --> 50:56.620
Well, if you want
competition, bitch,

50:56.620 --> 50:59.156
I'm gonna bring it to
your ass, though. [laughs]

50:59.156 --> 51:02.059
If you were in their position,
who would you send home?

51:02.059 --> 51:03.627
- Ooh.
- Oh.

51:03.627 --> 51:07.298
I'm not as confident
in Farrah's skills.

51:07.298 --> 51:10.701
Honestly, girls like her,
to me, they're not showgirls.

51:10.701 --> 51:12.503
They look good on Instagram,

51:12.503 --> 51:15.940
and they hope that the clothes
and the jewels and the--

51:15.940 --> 51:17.074
Make up for talent.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.342
But it doesn't.

51:18.342 --> 51:20.444
And tonight proved that.

51:20.444 --> 51:22.980
I'm just disappointed
that Jasmine didn't even think

51:22.980 --> 51:25.215
to like write down an outline.

51:25.215 --> 51:27.885
At least Farrah Moan, she had
a fully realized concept.

51:27.885 --> 51:30.354
I mean, we could tell some
preparation went into it.

51:30.354 --> 51:31.855
Right.

51:31.855 --> 51:34.458
My mind is not made up.

51:34.458 --> 51:35.993
Why should you stay?

51:35.993 --> 51:40.064
I have come to "All Stars" 4
with something to prove.

51:40.064 --> 51:43.033
If you choose me to stay,
I'm going to fucking fight,

51:43.033 --> 51:45.002
because I never once felt
like I could be a winner,

51:45.002 --> 51:47.271
and like for the first time
in my life,

51:47.271 --> 51:49.573
I really feel like
I could win something.

51:49.573 --> 51:50.975
Ugh.

51:50.975 --> 51:56.280
If you stay or you go,
you've got to stop crying.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.049
You've got to pull it together.

51:59.049 --> 52:00.851
Sis, I think
you are stupid funny.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.086
Right.

52:02.086 --> 52:04.421
And I think that
if you just had a skeleton,

52:04.421 --> 52:07.524
it would have went by
just a lot smoother.

52:07.524 --> 52:09.793
Recently, within
the past couple of years,

52:09.793 --> 52:11.362
I've been doing
the Laugh Factory.

52:11.362 --> 52:13.530
I have got nothing
but great reviews.

52:13.530 --> 52:15.733
I can go down a list,
oh, you know, this happened,

52:15.733 --> 52:17.501
this happened, this happened,
that happened.

52:17.501 --> 52:18.802
But it's not about that.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.405
If I stay, I stay.
If I go, I go.

52:21.405 --> 52:23.107
There's no love lost,
because it's a game.

52:23.107 --> 52:24.641
Things happen,
you know what I mean?

52:24.641 --> 52:27.244
You know how the girls
don't want to beg.

52:27.244 --> 52:28.946
But there's a difference
between like begging

52:28.946 --> 52:31.949
and saying if you keep me,

52:31.949 --> 52:34.551
trust and believe
you won't see me here again.

52:34.551 --> 52:36.620
Where's that extra fight, girl?

52:36.620 --> 52:38.889
If you keep me, you keep me,
then we gonna ride it out.

52:38.889 --> 52:40.658
If you don't,
we still gonna ride it out.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.026
Right. I can't with her.

52:42.026 --> 52:44.228
Like if you can't fight
for yourself,

52:44.228 --> 52:46.997
there's a whole lot
of other girls who will.

52:46.997 --> 52:50.167
Now that I have the power,
can you send both?

52:50.167 --> 52:51.635
I don't know.

52:51.635 --> 52:54.204
So...yeah.

53:30.107 --> 53:33.110
I have to send
one of these girls home.

53:33.110 --> 53:39.183
And I wasn't expecting
the emotional side of this

53:39.183 --> 53:41.618
to be as hard as it is.

53:42.786 --> 53:44.555
Feelings are not fact.

53:44.555 --> 53:49.526
We cannot let the way we feel
determine how we act.

whatever, da-da-da-da.

53:53.030 --> 53:55.699
I'm not really worried
about them.

53:55.699 --> 53:58.802
I'm here to take the crown.

53:58.802 --> 54:00.170
Period.

54:05.109 --> 54:06.610

for this one,
