<i>In Hazzard County
folks like to tell stories.</i>

00:09.442 --> 00:11.774
<i>Most are made up or embellished.</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:16.305
<i>Like the time I told everybody in town
that I wrestled three gators at once</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:19.910
<i>when really it was just two slow kids
and a basset hound.</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:23.050
<i>These legends become a part of us.</i>

00:23.123 --> 00:26.149
<i>They show who we are
and who we'd like to be.</i>

00:26.593 --> 00:30.029
<i>Now, I know you've heard of few
about Hazzard's most infamous residents.</i>

00:30.096 --> 00:32.758
<i>But this one, the smallest child in Hazzard</i>

00:32.832 --> 00:35.926
<i>can rattle it off
as fast as he can hot-wire a Chevy.</i>

00:36.469 --> 00:38.460
<i>This here's how it all started.</i>

00:38.938 --> 00:42.772
<i>This is how Bo and Luke
became the Dukes of Hazzard.</i>

00:49.916 --> 00:53.909
<i>Bo Duke. Your average 16-year-old
itching to get his license.</i>

00:54.354 --> 00:56.914
Shopping cart! Shopping cart!
Shopping cart!

00:58.825 --> 01:01.293
<i>Maybe the seventh time will be the charm.</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:08.332
<i>Calling all units. In pursuit of
a male teenager driving a station wagon,</i>

01:08.401 --> 01:10.733
<i>possible hostage situation.</i>

01:10.804 --> 01:13.967
<i>Yeah, Bo Duke.
He's trying to get his license again, huh?</i>

01:14.107 --> 01:16.132
<i>Yeah. He'll be stringed off.</i>

01:16.209 --> 01:17.198
<i>As is.</i>

01:25.885 --> 01:28.217
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

01:28.288 --> 01:32.554
Sorry about that. Kind of hard
to concentrate with all that screaming.

01:32.826 --> 01:37.024
<i>In case you can't already tell,
Bo knows one speed. Fast.</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:40.032
<i>He's 99% instinct and 1% brains.</i>

01:40.133 --> 01:41.430
<i>And that's on a good day.</i>

01:41.501 --> 01:43.128
- I can jump it.
- No, no, no.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.171
- No.
- Oh, shit!

01:52.712 --> 01:56.773
- That fool's crazy. I'm out of here.
- Wait. Did I pass?

01:59.085 --> 02:02.452
<i>No, Bo, you sure as shit didn't,
but you got Tasered</i>

02:02.522 --> 02:04.114
<i>and I hear that's fun.</i>

02:07.660 --> 02:10.753
<i>You might think Bo was
the crown prince of public mayhem,</i>

02:10.830 --> 02:14.459
<i>but four counties over, there was
another contender vying for that throne,</i>

02:14.534 --> 02:16.434
<i>his cousin, Luke Duke.</i>

02:16.769 --> 02:18.100
<i>This poor green pup thought</i>

02:18.171 --> 02:20.765
<i>that the way to a woman's heart
was by blowing shit up.</i>

02:20.840 --> 02:22.865
<i>Someday Luke will learn
that when it comes to women,</i>

02:22.942 --> 02:25.308
<i>he was focused on the wrong kind of bang.</i>

02:25.378 --> 02:27.710
She's a classy kid. Real lady.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.275
Forget about her, Luke.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.278
Let me show you your future
under this table here.

02:33.353 --> 02:37.483
I'm sorry, psychic whore,
but I've already seen my future.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.649
And it's with Debbie Sue.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.753
- Hey, are you ready?
- Hell, I better be ready.

02:45.064 --> 02:48.261
X 90 Armageddons,
Yellow Cycle of Thunders,

02:48.334 --> 02:50.894
Nasty Napalmers that'll
peel back her eyelids,

02:50.970 --> 02:54.303
blow off her silky golden hair,
melt her brain stem,

02:54.874 --> 02:56.774
and open up her heart.

02:56.943 --> 03:00.344
- And she knows this stuff is coming?
- She doesn't even know my name.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.437
Come on, let's go.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.106
She will after tonight.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.782
Hey, Luke,

03:05.852 --> 03:09.948
looks like your princess
is about ready to get her castle stormed.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.057
<i>Sometimes you get so darn busy

03:13.126 --> 03:15.754
<i>that you take your eyes off the prize,</i>

<i>or maybe even blow the prize up.</i>

<i>I reckon Luke never planned on
carpet-bombing the county fair.</i>

03:36.316 --> 03:39.376
<i>Twenty injuries, 15 grand in damage,</i>

03:39.452 --> 03:41.886
<i>and Debbie Sue still doesn't know
Luke's name.</i>

03:41.955 --> 03:44.150
<i>Better luck next time, Romeo.</i>

03:44.524 --> 03:47.425
- Get up, get up.
- Luke, you could've killed someone.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.720
<i>Bo's parents and Luke's parents
convinced the judges</i>

03:50.797 --> 03:55.359
<i>that the boys' salvation lay in a summer
of hard work on Uncle Jesse's farm,</i>

03:55.435 --> 03:57.528
<i>a taste of the simple life.</i>

03:57.937 --> 04:00.235
<i>Simple life. That's a good one.</i>

04:01.140 --> 04:02.698
Hazzard County.

04:04.777 --> 04:05.903
Damn.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.577
- What's so funny, Goldilocks?
- Two things always make me laugh.

04:17.223 --> 04:21.887
Monkeys dressed as humans, and
some pussy getting chucked off the bus.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.261
How would like to spend
the night in the morgue?

04:25.331 --> 04:26.696
Show me the way.

04:31.204 --> 04:35.971
Hey, hey. Hey, guys. Nice to see
y'all cousins getting reacquainted.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.572
- Bo?
- Luke?

04:40.713 --> 04:42.044
Welcome to Hazzard.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.343
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
- Uncle Jesse.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.950
Oh, I'll take the brunette,
you get the blonde.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.581
Man, this J.D. Hogg
sure does like to smile.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.185
He's got a lot to smile about.
He owns the whole town.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.988
I knew him back
when he was messing his britches.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.120
I think he smiled when he did that.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.756
He ain't a bad guy,
but just don't cross him.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.300
Oh, my goodness,
some things have changed.

05:03.102 --> 05:06.663
Corals and cocktails, coz.
I just found Jesus. Yeah!

05:06.739 --> 05:07.763
Yeah.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.001
Keep the garden hoses
in your trousers, boys.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.703
Lot of fun to water the lawn,

05:11.778 --> 05:15.771
but then you got to feed the flowers
and then you got to send them to school.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.510
- Same old truck.
- Yeah. Same old truck.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.222
Hey, Ab.

05:36.936 --> 05:40.099
Come on, already.
I'm gonna be 175 by the time he gets here.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.199
Only running he's done is against J.D.
For county commissioner.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.210
How you doing, Ab?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.405
Got your medicine for you, old buddy.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.108
Reach in there and grab you two
what you like.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.522
I hear you, buddy. See you next week.
Go get 'em.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.425
That's his medicine?

06:03.763 --> 06:07.494
Well, he's 112 years old.
I bring him his medicine every week.

06:07.567 --> 06:12.061
He's got scurvy, malaria, rickets,
chlamydia. You name it, he's got it.

06:12.972 --> 06:14.462
Come on, let's go see Daisy.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.531
- Shotgun.
- Nope, I got here first.

06:16.609 --> 06:18.167
Get in first.

06:20.913 --> 06:24.576
- Whoa.
- Look out for the dog, Uncle Jesse!

06:26.119 --> 06:29.577
<i>You ever wanna find
Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane,</i>

06:29.655 --> 06:33.147
<i>go 10 blocks past sanity
and take a right on crazy.</i>

06:33.226 --> 06:34.488
Hang on there, Jesse.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.822
<i>Can't miss him.</i>

06:35.895 --> 06:40.161
Ordinance 733. Hound dogs have
the right of way here in Hazzard County.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.233
That's great detective work, Rosco.
But it ain't no crime.

06:43.302 --> 06:46.237
Maybe lipping off
to an officer of the law is, there,

06:46.305 --> 06:49.832
- Blue Jeans and Bongo Drums.
- We didn't want to hit your dog.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.776
Now was I talking to you, there,
Johnny Jingle Nuts?

06:52.845 --> 06:55.006
Ain't you got nothing better to do?

06:55.548 --> 07:00.144
Well, maybe I could stuff you
in my hold there, little partner.

07:00.219 --> 07:02.949
And you could collect
toenail clippings for fun.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.816
Now, you all just mind yourself.

07:05.892 --> 07:09.521
'Cause this here
is Rosco P. Coltrane's jurisdiction.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.730
I'll send you straight to hell
in a bucket of chicken.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.267
Come on, kid.

07:16.202 --> 07:19.660
Old Rosco ain't never fired that gun,
but he's always looking for a reason.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.468
Let's don't give him one.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.778
Oh, man, pigtails. I love pigtails.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.052
Daisy'll introduce us to the hot locals.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.558
- So we can tag some wild game.
- Yeah.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.857
And then you can stop beating off
to them breast exam ads.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.158
Hey, guys. Hey.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.462
<i>Daisy Duke.</i>

07:49.535 --> 07:53.096
<i>You can't see it yet, but there's a woman
waiting to burst out of her</i>

07:53.172 --> 07:54.469
<i>like an alien invader.</i>

07:54.540 --> 07:58.601
I promised her folks I wouldn't let her date
until she's 18 and she just hit 18.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.703
And she's turning some heads.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.980
What kind of heads is she turning?

08:03.049 --> 08:05.540
<i>And never far behind, Enos Strate.</i>

08:05.885 --> 08:09.480
<i>He likes to hover waiting
to come to her rescue. Kind of sweet.</i>

08:09.555 --> 08:10.988
Look at you.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.523
Oh, hey, Daisy.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.494
Y'all are cuter than boxing gloves
on a kitten.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.554
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- Hi. How was Bible school?

08:19.632 --> 08:22.795
Well, Pastor Phil says,
you know, that being a virgin's cool,

08:22.869 --> 08:24.928
so all us girls in class, we signed this oath

08:25.004 --> 08:27.404
saying we won't have sex until marriage.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.941
These are all the things we can't do.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.504
Anyway, me and the girls are
real psyched about being virgins.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.105
- All the girls signed this?
- You bet.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.751
Can't wait to be a virgin again.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.647
Luke, honey, you crying?

08:44.490 --> 08:46.390
Just happy to see you, Daisy.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.757
The Lord loves y'all.

08:50.830 --> 08:54.061
He just wants you to know he'll be
with you all summer, too. Huh, Daisy?

08:54.133 --> 08:58.001
Right. This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.437
You know what we should be doing
with this shit?

09:04.610 --> 09:05.907
Should be blowin' this shit up.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.775
Hey, you know you can make
low-grade bombs with manure?

09:07.847 --> 09:09.439
Whoa! What are you doing?

09:09.515 --> 09:12.507
- I'm going fast, so I can get done.
- Oh, yeah.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.181
Okay, truce. Jeez.

09:16.522 --> 09:20.481
Wash up. Come on in for supper.
We got ham hocks, pickles, pig's feet.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.495
And you can finish shoveling that manure
after you have your dessert.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.757
Then we're done?

09:24.830 --> 09:27.128
Then you got to go down by the road
and fix the fence,

09:27.199 --> 09:29.429
feed the chickens and bale some hay.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.835
So, we work, what, all the time?

09:33.239 --> 09:36.606
No, well, not all the time.
You get four solid hours of sleep.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.645
And remember,
Annabelle can't inseminate herself.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.006
God!

09:51.991 --> 09:56.291
<i>Nothing like a good day's rest
after an honest day's work.</i>

09:56.729 --> 10:00.096
<i>Unless, of course,
you're planning your escape.</i>

10:13.479 --> 10:15.174
Vintage Luke Duke.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.512
Sneaking off without me again?

10:19.285 --> 10:21.082
What's that supposed to mean?

10:21.153 --> 10:24.816
I'm 10, you're 11. The nurses' school.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.126
The nurses.
You didn't want to climb that tree.

10:30.229 --> 10:34.165
You wanted to map it out, draw
a diagram, take a course in tree climbing,

10:34.233 --> 10:36.531
but I convinced you.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.365
What did you see?

10:38.604 --> 10:40.435
I saw boobies.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.604
Big boobies, little boobies,

10:44.243 --> 10:47.838
classy boobies, I saw a feast of boobies.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.345
The Thanksgiving Day Parade of boobies.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.775
And did you thank me?

10:55.621 --> 10:56.952
Thank you.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.351
No, you heard someone coming
and you got down.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.652
I've had a lifetime of boobies.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.926
But I will never, ever forget
you leaving me.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.195
Six years ago, all right? I was a little kid.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.042
Sweet ride.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.952
Uncle Jesse's friends with a pimp?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.180
Boss Hogg.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.987
- That man knows how to live.
- That's business.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.621
Money, power, probably got a hot wife.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.959
Definitely no farmer.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.726
Yeah.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.463
The Boar's Nest is kicking! It's
an election year. Put that on, dumpling.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.834
- Here you go, darling.
- Oh, thank you.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.236
I'm going in.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.236
Bo, don't... Bo!

11:51.677 --> 11:53.008
Boys.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.705
Hi, fellas.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.006
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

11:58.984 --> 12:02.920
But four slices of a sex pie
just walked right through that door.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.457
I think they need a little scoop of Bo
on top.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.663
Whoa! Where do you think
you boys are going?

12:12.064 --> 12:13.429
We're with them.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.401
Okay. Thank you.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.439
Nice sleeves.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.735
No place for minors
is definitely a place for us.

12:25.811 --> 12:28.075
- There's got to be another way in.
- Let's go.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.138
- Whoa, ladies.
- Yeah.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.273
- Well, what have we got here?
- Let me know.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.477
- Okay.
- Bye.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.313
Hello, folks, how you doing?

12:37.389 --> 12:39.289
How are you doing?

12:39.391 --> 12:41.484
- How y'all doing?
- You called my mother a what?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.118
Not gonna take that.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.727
- Look at that.
- There you go. Great shot.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.061
J.D. Hogg is in the house.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.365
Hey, now,
they're fighting over you, there, Joanne.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.031
Hey.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.836
Hey, hey, hey. You wanna piece of him,
you better take a piece of me.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.513
It's locked.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.084
- I'm going this way.
- Wait up.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.884
<i>Boss Hogg's prize boar Dainty.</i>

13:12.458 --> 13:15.916
<i>Three time state champ
and a close second in J.D. 's heart,</i>

13:15.995 --> 13:18.122
<i>after his wife Lulu.</i>

13:18.197 --> 13:19.960
It's Hogg's hog.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.262
Stay. Sit.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.910
- So, how's Lulu?
- Expensive.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.641
My wife's got a jewelry habit that'd
make a crack whore look sensible.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.081
Lucky you're the richest guy
in Hazzard, huh?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.948
Yeah. It's good enough
for a county commissioner.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.146
But what about the future?

13:42.221 --> 13:47.090
Governor Hogg.
President Hogg. Prime Minister Hogg.

13:47.593 --> 13:51.154
- Well, I ain't much into politics.
- These things cost big bucks.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.801
Seems my temporary blindness
to your illegal activities

13:59.872 --> 14:02.705
- should be worth more like 10%/º.
- Oh, it is.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.466
- Undying friendship.
- Which is nice.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.272
But I'm thinking more like 25%/º.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.145
Well, I ain't making a lot of money
out there selling shine.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.151
I'm paying a few bills,
but I ain't getting rich.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.153
Which brings me to my next proposal.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.520
It's high time we expand
your little operation, sell abroad.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.320
I ain't selling no broads.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.359
- That's good.
- Yeah.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.829
Yeah. No, I'm talking
about neighboring counties.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.425
I can't afford to go to jail.
I've got three young'uns that I'm raising.

14:29.501 --> 14:32.231
You're thinking small, Jesse.
We could be partners.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.568
Rich as rich, chocolatey Ovaltine.

14:37.576 --> 14:41.444
I really don't think it's right that
I cut you in after you've been elected.

14:41.513 --> 14:45.108
- It's kind of like bribery, don't you think?
- It is bribery, Jesse.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.243
What the hell you think
we've been doing out there,

14:47.319 --> 14:49.583
selling cotton candy to nuns?

14:49.688 --> 14:51.883
One way or the other,
I'm gonna get my money.

14:51.957 --> 14:55.916
You got two weeks, then I'm sending
Rosco out to foreclose on the farm.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.895
No more slipping on payments.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.667
- Hey, where did she go?
- Who?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.033
Who?

15:05.671 --> 15:08.435
Come on, we'll save you, Dainty.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.436
Hang on, girl.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.234
Come on.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.712
No, no. Hold on. Come on.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.409
Oh, no.

15:23.689 --> 15:27.682
- Would you pull, Bo?
- That is... What did she eat?

15:35.834 --> 15:37.301
Dainty!

15:42.141 --> 15:43.608
Dainty!

15:46.211 --> 15:49.044
Did you meet my nephews over there,
Bo and Luke?

15:49.915 --> 15:52.611
Y'all better pray my girl survives.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.852
Two weeks and your farm is mine.

15:56.922 --> 16:00.358
Dukes have been living and dying
on this farm for 150 years.

16:00.426 --> 16:03.862
Great Grandpa Duke built this
out of a bucket of nails and a rock.

16:03.929 --> 16:07.262
My pa died sitting in that chair
right where you are, Luke.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.597
Shat himself
and then went gently into the night.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.363
God rest his soul.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.072
Hell, I was born right here on this table.

16:14.139 --> 16:18.007
Mama's water broke, I popped out there
like a log ride at a water park.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.911
I can't lose my home.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.407
Look, I'll get a job at the Boar's Nest.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.009
And I'll crack open some shine
to settle our nerves.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.021
Can't wait for that tasty beverage.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.387
You ain't never drinking that shine.
You hear me?

16:32.458 --> 16:33.686
Now, J.D.'s mad.

16:33.759 --> 16:37.092
And that stunt y'all pulled
with the flying pig didn't help none.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.686
And he's gonna collect.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.322
And I couldn't make enough shine

16:40.399 --> 16:43.197
and still have time to run it
and cover the loan.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.134
No. But we could.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.407
Hell, yeah. We could run it.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.969
Us working together,
we'd come up with the money.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.379
No, your folks sent y'all down here
to be good men,

16:57.449 --> 16:58.848
not to be shine runners.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.545
And if you get throwed in jail,
you could be there a long time.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.554
Listen, Uncle Jesse.
We don't have a choice.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.613
All we have is two weeks.

17:05.723 --> 17:08.887
- Lf we sell enough...
- And we're quick enough...

17:09.060 --> 17:11.393
You don't have to worry
about Boss Hogg again.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.896
We're Dukes. This is our farm, too.

17:13.965 --> 17:17.628
- And no one's taking it from us.
- It ain't a bad idea, Uncle Jesse.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.531
All we need is...

17:21.773 --> 17:24.402
- A fast car.
- Yeah.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.378
<i>There's an old saying
that the journey of a thousand miles</i>

17:30.449 --> 17:32.349
<i>begins with a single step.</i>

17:32.418 --> 17:36.912
<i>Sometimes those steps can be blocked
by a bunch of annoying little girls.</i>

17:37.289 --> 17:40.816
- Hello, tiny girls.
- Excuse me, ladies.

17:41.193 --> 17:45.527
Have any of you adorable little tykes seen
a super-charged,

17:45.597 --> 17:49.260
high performance, V-8 engine
laying around here anywhere?

17:49.334 --> 17:51.564
Look, we're 9, what do you want from us?

17:51.637 --> 17:54.504
Oh, that's it. Come here. Come here.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.701
Oh, you hide behind those pigtails
and those braces, come on. Come on.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.505
Man, that guy's an idiot.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.246
She ain't worth it.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.841
Yeah. She's lucky you won't beat up
anything under 10.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.750
She's lucky I got standards.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.583
A gasoline bomb just detonated
in my heart.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.356
- Who are they?
- The Handy sisters.

18:17.663 --> 18:21.497
Brooke and Ali. Look, those girls
have reps for doing anything.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.193
- Stay away.
- Oh, definitely.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.328
Definitely gonna stay away
from the girls who'll do anything.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.873
Sound advice. I'm gonna go talk to them.

18:29.007 --> 18:32.272
Who needs to talk when you got
a blonde river on your head?

18:32.344 --> 18:34.642
- Bo, let me talk to them.
- Blonde river.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.476
- Talk.
- Blonde river.

18:43.555 --> 18:44.817
Hello, up there.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.585
- Hey, y'all.
- Hi.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.193
Yeah. I'm Luke. Cousin Bo.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.260
- Charmed.
- Seriously?

18:52.331 --> 18:53.992
Thanks.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.632
That is awesome.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.330
Fellas.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.137
We gotta go.
We got some business to attend to.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.402
We do?

19:04.843 --> 19:07.744
We do. It was nice chatting with you.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.374
Come on.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.983
<i>So, they set out to find the perfect car.</i>

19:14.052 --> 19:17.419
<i>Starting at the high school,
where kids learn reading, writing</i>

19:17.489 --> 19:19.184
<i>and the real meaning of third base.</i>

19:19.258 --> 19:22.523
There's only one guy I know
who is a genius with cars.

19:22.594 --> 19:26.496
Are sure, Daisy? I mean, we need
a serious garage, not some high school.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.432
<i>They might cut home economics
and the debate squad,</i>

19:29.501 --> 19:32.629
<i>but there's always room in the budget
for shop class in Hazzard.</i>

19:32.704 --> 19:34.638
How come boys never notice me?

19:34.706 --> 19:38.301
'Cause you're dressed like a lady golfer
who likes to swoon lady bikers.

19:38.377 --> 19:41.904
No, he's kidding. You're more of
a lady construction worker on her day off.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.915
So, where is this engine whiz
you've been talking about?

19:44.983 --> 19:46.951
Somebody call my name?

19:49.922 --> 19:51.014
Hey. Hey.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.615
- Daisy Duke.
- Cooter.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.991
These are my cousins, Bo and Luke.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.896
Pleasure to meet you,
Sweet Innocent and Dark Mystery.

20:00.966 --> 20:04.197
Just nicknames. Take 'em or leave 'em.

20:04.269 --> 20:07.636
My stars. That is real nice.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.174
Hey, I'll bet that breathes real good,
doesn't it?

20:10.242 --> 20:13.109
- Are you the shop teacher?
- Hell, no. I'm a student.

20:13.178 --> 20:16.204
- Daisy tells us you know cars.
- Cars? Yes.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.243
Look at this baby.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.549
Math and history? No.

20:20.919 --> 20:24.150
A high school diploma remains
just out of reach.

20:24.256 --> 20:28.590
Lord willing and the creek don't rise,
they'll let me be a senior a fourth time.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.896
There's still much work to be done here.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.229
- We need something reliable.
- Something with speed.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.058
Speed I can do.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.969
My trademark? Horns.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.412
That song needs work.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.382
Okay, you want something
a little more edgier, then?

20:53.685 --> 20:55.676
What do you say,
we test drive this sucker, huh?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.052
Well, shit. I'll try anything once.

20:58.123 --> 21:01.058
Except guy-on-guy. I'm just kidding.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.053
I'd try that.

21:03.829 --> 21:07.094
All right. Come on.
I got the perfect place to open her up.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.263
Watch out. Watch your back.
Coming through.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.137
Excuse me. Pardon me.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.743
- Whoa!
- Look out, man.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.747
Coming through. Bo Duke.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.409
You're gonna kill us, Bo.

21:27.486 --> 21:31.582
<i>Here's a little reminder that we live
in the greatest country on the planet.</i>

21:32.190 --> 21:33.452
Oh, man.

21:33.592 --> 21:34.581
Hello, ladies.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.252
Oh, you missed a spot.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.186
Hey!

21:46.171 --> 21:47.866
Please don't touch that!

21:49.508 --> 21:51.032
Get back and help me.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.542
Bo, you can't go there.
Don't be driving down the halls like that.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.643
You can't be driving
down the halls like that.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.621
Slow down. Pull that thing over.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.221
Oh, no. Oh, man.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.123
- Well, I could jump it.
- It?

22:13.265 --> 22:14.562
Her. It.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.931
Whatever. I can jump it.

22:24.376 --> 22:25.775
Hot damn.

22:25.844 --> 22:29.780
I ain't seen moves like that since a tornado
touched down in Miss Lally's class

22:29.848 --> 22:32.578
and ended the evolution debate
once and for all.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.546
- Hey, Enos.
- Cooter.

22:35.620 --> 22:39.181
- Are you mixed up with them?
- Like a mixed romaine salad

22:39.257 --> 22:41.657
topped with vinaigrette and pecans.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.888
- Hi, Enos.
- Hi, Daisy.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.988
Looks like you got manhandled.

22:47.065 --> 22:51.001
Actually, it was the JV cheerleading
squad. Thank God it wasn't varsity.

22:51.236 --> 22:54.000
Listen, Enos. My cousins are new in town.

22:54.072 --> 22:57.064
Maybe, as my friend, you can let them go.
Just this once.

22:57.142 --> 23:00.043
Oh, sure, Daisy. For you.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.440
Let's get you back together.

23:03.548 --> 23:07.712
They don't teach you about cheerleaders
in training you to be a hall monitor.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.850
I'd say you can handle that engine, Cooter.

23:09.921 --> 23:11.149
Yeah?

23:11.223 --> 23:14.659
Now all we need is the perfect body.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.787
Boys, I feel like I've been failing
my whole life for this moment.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.659
Come on. I know a place. Hop in.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.958
<i>The county junkyard.</i>

23:24.102 --> 23:26.570
<i>Yep. You might see
nothing but piles of junk,</i>

23:26.638 --> 23:31.041
<i>but these boys see warm dollops of clay
ripe for sculpting into greatness.</i>

23:37.716 --> 23:40.184
What are you looking for, Buddha?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.710
My gut is gonna tell me
when I've found the right car.

23:44.055 --> 23:47.320
All right, don't question me on this
and I won't question you on being a virgin.

23:47.392 --> 23:48.825
All right, who told you that, huh?

23:48.894 --> 23:51.055
I want names, addresses, phone numbers,
next of kin.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.029
'Cause I've slept
with thousands of women.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.259
Oh, well, that's smart in this day and age.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.097
Well, we're all virgins
till we've been with the one that we love.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.798
Well, that's good. Except I ain't a virgin.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.999
Virginity ain't a crime, now.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.200
Except in the State of Bo.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.010
Watch this.

24:13.151 --> 24:14.277
I'm okay.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.016
What's with sliding across the hood.

24:20.692 --> 24:24.924
Why would I waste my time
walking all the way around the car?

24:25.397 --> 24:27.058
Think, Luke.
You're supposed to be the smart one.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.861
I'm the good-looking one.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.265
I know the right car is here somewhere.

24:34.773 --> 24:35.831
Bo.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.412
I admire his passion, but that boy is crazy.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.212
Well, what do you say we call it a day?

24:46.785 --> 24:49.720
Go cool off. Get some smoothies.
I know a place.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.118
- All right.
- Come on, big guy.

24:53.391 --> 24:56.485
Boys, welcome to Hogg's Ravine.

24:57.562 --> 25:00.588
- Is there anything Hogg doesn't own?
- Nope.

25:00.932 --> 25:03.730
But one day,
I'm gonna open up my own garage.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.793
Cooter's Garage.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.570
It'll have my name on it.
Boss ain't gonna own that.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.333
Hey, what's on the other side
of the ravine?

25:11.409 --> 25:13.604
Factory for Hogg's ice cream.

25:14.145 --> 25:17.637
- Hogg makes ice cream?
- Yup, yup, yup. I never had any,

25:17.716 --> 25:21.015
but I heard
the peach melba's absolutely outrageous.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.817
Anyway, no one's allowed over there.
Road's all gated up.

25:25.056 --> 25:27.354
Boss is very protective of his recipe.

25:28.059 --> 25:29.390
Hey, boys.

25:33.899 --> 25:36.629
Sunny-side up or over easy?
Call it in the air.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.668
I've always been a breast man.

25:38.737 --> 25:41.331
Okay, you take the rack, I'll take the back.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.369
Watch and learn, Luke. Watch and learn.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.839
Ladies, do me.

25:55.086 --> 25:57.179
Hey, girls, watch me.

25:59.024 --> 26:01.254
- Why you got to go and do that?
- I like it.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.760
- Anybody ever dive in there?
- Sometimes.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.804
I'll be dipped.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.070
You said people dive in here all the time.
I thought it was safe.

26:21.146 --> 26:24.377
Oh, no, hell, no.
I said sometimes people dive.

26:24.449 --> 26:26.508
Most of the time they end up crippled or

26:26.585 --> 26:28.917
- on life support or brain damaged.
- Oh, man.

26:28.987 --> 26:30.079
Just depends.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.385
Oh, man. I'm coming for you, Luke.

26:50.008 --> 26:52.135
Come on. Don't die on me, now.

26:52.877 --> 26:56.472
<i>You'd think Bo'd be under water
looking for his drowning cousin.</i>

26:56.548 --> 26:58.709
<i>But it's hard to think
about your loved ones</i>

26:58.783 --> 27:01.343
<i>when you've found a sunken treasure.</i>

27:04.255 --> 27:05.244
Breathe.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.824
Score one for Cooter.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.830
There is a car down there.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.627
Thanks for saving me, Bo.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.951
It's a '69 Dodge Charger.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.920
Well, I'll be mud on a frog's back.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.994
Hey, back in my pop's day, they used to
dare each other to jump the ravine.

27:51.069 --> 27:53.469
Some stupid son of a bitch tried.

27:53.772 --> 27:56.900
- Sounds like he didn't make it.
- Nobody can. It's impossible.

27:56.975 --> 27:59.375
Car must not be that hot, neither.

27:59.511 --> 28:03.345
No. That is the car. I can feel it.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.242
It just hasn't found the right driver yet.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.092
It's from the Civil War.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.463
What's your lucky number, Bo?

29:34.205 --> 29:35.263
One.

29:48.453 --> 29:52.048
<i>Ain't that just about
the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?</i>

29:52.123 --> 29:55.752
<i>That car kicks so much ass
it should have feet.</i>

29:58.730 --> 30:02.632
- Why you gotta go and do that?
- Because it's cool.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.994
You sure you don't want me
to weld your side shut?

30:05.069 --> 30:06.900
- No.
- All right.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.099
- Ready, coz?
- Ready, coz.

30:13.011 --> 30:16.811
All right, boys, listen.
This little baby here... Oh, sorry.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.246
That's mechanic talk.

30:18.316 --> 30:22.980
This car, well, it's got enough parts,
it'd make the Pentagon wet.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.820
All right? Break it in nice and easy.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.587
Race you.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.007
Go, Bo!

30:45.176 --> 30:46.871
I'm not gonna see that car for a while,
am I?

30:46.945 --> 30:48.310
I don't think so.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.569
Oh, my goodness.

31:13.638 --> 31:16.334
I wanna paint. I wanna sail.

31:16.741 --> 31:19.005
I wanna help old people and children.

31:19.077 --> 31:23.571
But most of all, I wanna drive this car
right through the sound barrier.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.013
Oh, my God.

31:26.851 --> 31:30.480
Bo just discovered religion and Cooter.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.223
Cooter, you're his prophet.
Thank you, man.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.725
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It's okay, pal.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.856
I promised myself I wouldn't cry today.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.295
Look at me.

31:40.865 --> 31:43.163
You're an honorary Duke now, Cooter.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.233
You know, when I was a Ridge Runner

31:45.303 --> 31:47.737
moving shine and leaving them cops
choking in my dust,

31:47.805 --> 31:50.535
we used to name our cars after generals.

31:51.476 --> 31:55.810
Oh, well, then, this should be named
after the greatest of all.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.311
General Lee.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.687
You know, running shine is a lot
like knowing how to kill a man

32:05.757 --> 32:07.088
with your thumb 12 ways.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.989
It ain't really that hard
once you know how,

32:09.060 --> 32:10.186
but you got to practice at it.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.422
You can kill a man with your thumb?

32:13.731 --> 32:15.289
Forget that part.
Here's what you got to remember.

32:15.366 --> 32:18.494
It's more than just speed out here.
You got to be smart.

32:18.569 --> 32:20.764
Been going over this map of Hazzard.

32:21.472 --> 32:23.770
- I think I got our routes figured out.
- Well, that's good.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.069
But you got to improvise.

32:25.143 --> 32:29.102
Unforeseen circumstances come up
quicker than a stiffy on prom night.

32:30.148 --> 32:33.515
Best advice I ever had was
from an old moonshiner buddy of mine,

32:33.584 --> 32:37.042
- old "Three Nipples" Ned.
- The man had three nipples?

32:37.221 --> 32:40.713
No, he really had four,
but we didn't want to call attention to it.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.818
So he told us on his death bed,
he said these three words.

32:43.895 --> 32:48.025
- He said, "Don't get caught."
- Cops got him?

32:48.099 --> 32:52.035
No, actually it was Emmy Lou Hassett.
It was that tertiary syphilis.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.331
That's another thing
you want to remember, now.

32:54.405 --> 32:56.396
If you don't want your pecker
to feel like a flame-thrower,

32:56.474 --> 32:58.203
you better wear a rubber.

32:58.409 --> 33:01.674
Uncle Jesse, don't you think
we should sample the product

33:01.746 --> 33:04.044
- for our customers' sake?
- Yeah, Bo's right.

33:04.115 --> 33:06.049
I mean, people might have questions.

33:06.117 --> 33:09.280
I don't think y'all's folks want y'all
out here drinking and driving shine.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.982
Time to baptize the General. Come on.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.437
<i>For a week those boys tore
up and down the county,</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:35.240
<i>making stops for every teacher,
preacher and milkmaid in sight.</i>

33:43.621 --> 33:47.955
<i>Bo and Luke became the fastest
shine runners in Hazzard history.</i>

34:36.974 --> 34:38.304
Holy water.

34:41.478 --> 34:42.672
Thank you.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.213
<i>So things were tasting sweeter</i>

34:52.290 --> 34:55.315
<i>than applejack in a honeydew melon
for the Duke boys.</i>

34:55.393 --> 34:58.157
<i>But remember,
Daisy wanted to help out, too,</i>

34:58.229 --> 35:01.528
<i>and she'd be damned
if she wasn't gonna make a contribution.</i>

35:03.901 --> 35:05.960
<i>Well, a new face in Hazzard.</i>

35:06.037 --> 35:08.403
<i>Now, I'll tell you city folk
ain't really my type,</i>

35:08.473 --> 35:10.998
<i>but this was a flavor
Daisy had never tasted.</i>

35:11.075 --> 35:12.406
Excuse me.

35:13.244 --> 35:14.711
Oh, I'm so sorry.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.009
I just want to see about a waitressing job.

35:17.081 --> 35:20.346
Look, don't worry.
A little water will take that right out.

35:21.786 --> 35:22.878
Look.

35:24.155 --> 35:28.489
I'm not trying to be rude,
but you just don't have the right look

35:29.060 --> 35:30.425
for the Nest.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.493
These girls are tough, confident.

35:37.702 --> 35:40.034
Oh, right.

35:40.738 --> 35:41.898
Hey.

35:42.106 --> 35:45.371
<i>Her interviewing skills
leave something to be desired.</i>

35:45.443 --> 35:46.432
Thank you.

35:46.511 --> 35:51.813
<i>But she accomplished one thing.
Daisy done gone and got herself smitten.</i>

35:52.783 --> 35:54.011
Daisy?

35:55.052 --> 35:58.544
I just acted like a fool in front of the most
gorgeous, handsome man

35:58.623 --> 36:00.420
ever to come to Hazzard.

36:01.826 --> 36:02.952
But I just got here.

36:03.928 --> 36:07.022
Ladies, hello.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.590
- Ladies.
- Hi.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.428
Brooke! Ali!

36:11.903 --> 36:14.531
Ladies! How you doing?

36:15.139 --> 36:17.198
- Cooter.
- Yeah?

36:18.709 --> 36:21.837
- Let's make a toast.
- Yes, yes, let's make a toast.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.474
To waking up in Chickasaw

36:24.549 --> 36:28.747
in the strong protective arms
of a female correctional officer.

36:29.453 --> 36:30.647
What a night!

36:36.994 --> 36:38.325
We're gonna go.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.921
Yeah, we're teaching erotic dance
at the senior center.

36:40.998 --> 36:43.398
And we're late. Sorry.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.892
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

36:47.171 --> 36:50.072
- Thanks a lot, Cooter.
- Was it the toast?

36:56.247 --> 36:57.373
Sorry.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.250
You guys came in
in that '69 Charger, right?

37:06.023 --> 37:07.490
The General Lee.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.360
Hi, I'm Hughie, the new manager.

37:13.264 --> 37:14.390
Yeah.

37:18.469 --> 37:21.870
I thought you'd like some Hogg d'oeuvres
on the house. Well, come on.

37:21.939 --> 37:26.808
Those Boss Hoggs in a blanket
are absolutely magic.

37:26.877 --> 37:28.310
Yes, they are.

37:29.146 --> 37:33.344
So I got to say, you guys have
one killer orange car out there.

37:34.619 --> 37:38.282
Yeah, two things I can't live without.
My car

37:39.690 --> 37:41.123
and my cell phone.

37:41.225 --> 37:43.750
Except I can't get any reception
around here.

37:43.828 --> 37:47.320
- How do you guys survive?
- We use a CB.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.198
A CB.

37:56.941 --> 38:00.240
Well, I have to get back to work,
but you know we should hang out

38:00.311 --> 38:02.142
if you guys know
anything to do around here.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.013
- Oh, yeah, we know lots to do.
- Yeah, all right. Excellent.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.483
Well, I'll see you guys around.

38:09.086 --> 38:14.114
Sorry, guys. Boss told me
to turn up the TV every time he's on.

38:14.225 --> 38:19.185
<i>Folks, Hazzard's sick. What's the cause?</i>

38:19.664 --> 38:22.292
Greedy shiners like these two

38:22.633 --> 38:25.193
selling their liquid fire
to the unsuspecting.

38:25.269 --> 38:26.327
Come on.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.770
Now let this be a warning
to all you moonshiners out there.

38:28.839 --> 38:32.104
My deputies will find you,
they'll smoke you out of your holes,

38:32.176 --> 38:34.303
and they'll send you back to hell.

38:39.016 --> 38:40.506
I ain't done yet!

38:41.786 --> 38:46.086
Earlier today I declared Hazzard
a dry county, and anyone

38:46.691 --> 38:49.159
<i>who uncovers a moonshine operation</i>

38:49.226 --> 38:53.959
will collect a handsome $25,000 reward.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.559
<i>Okay.</i>

38:57.768 --> 38:59.463
Now to show my level of commitment,

38:59.537 --> 39:03.200
I'm turning my own Boar's Nest
into an ice cream parlor.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.673
Yummy, huh?

39:06.610 --> 39:08.635
That's good eating, right there.

39:09.647 --> 39:12.912
Let this be known, that together

39:13.317 --> 39:16.309
we can all live high on the Hogg.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.924
How do you like my Hoggettes?

39:23.394 --> 39:24.486
Thank you.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.726
I can't believe
that Boss declared war on us.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.903
- You worried?
- Please.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.838
The General Lee comes equipped
with a gas pedal and my foot.

39:37.908 --> 39:40.706
We got the fastest car in 37 counties.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.508
- Well, well, well.
- Afternoon, Rosco.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.448
We just saw you on TV.
You know, you make a convincing sheriff.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.144
You really do. Hey, Flash.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.881
Don't you touch Flash, you deviant. Hey!

39:50.955 --> 39:53.515
You know I got
a couple of shine-swilling weasels

39:53.591 --> 39:56.856
in the back of my squad car,
and they're starting to smell like ass.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.690
Where is that shine-selling uncle of yours?

39:58.763 --> 40:01.027
You know, you're much better-looking
in person?

40:01.098 --> 40:03.828
Delicate. TV hides
how pretty you really are.

40:04.568 --> 40:08.334
Now, I didn't come over here
to have you tell me how pretty I am.

40:08.706 --> 40:11.004
I know how pretty I am.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.539
Now you open up the General Lee
and let me see that contraband.

40:14.612 --> 40:15.977
Come on, move.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.538
That's why they call me the rattlesnake,
boy.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.813
- 'Cause when I sense trouble, I strike.
...contraband, Rosco.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.787
<i>Figures old Rosco'd leave the keys
right on the seat.</i>

40:24.855 --> 40:25.844
Go, go, go.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.585
<i>He's dumb as a screen door
on a submarine.</i>

40:28.659 --> 40:31.184
That's a real fancy car you got here,
Rosco.

40:31.562 --> 40:34.030
Almost make you seem like a real sheriff.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.962
Well, thank you for... Wait a minute.

40:36.033 --> 40:40.766
I am the real sheriff here.
I won 46.7%/º of the vote.

40:40.871 --> 40:43.897
- Who did you run against?
- Well, I ran unopposed,

40:43.974 --> 40:46.408
'cause no one was man enough
to run against me.

40:46.477 --> 40:49.446
Now you get this rig popped open
real quick-like,

40:49.513 --> 40:52.004
like a little tiny Chinese toy box... Hey!

40:52.082 --> 40:55.108
They gave you a real gun, Rosco.
That is awesome. That is great.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.347
Hey, don't you touch that.
That's standard issue.

40:57.421 --> 41:00.322
Don't touch my puppy. Don't touch her.

41:00.391 --> 41:04.691
- Hey, my bullets! What...
- Oh, now look what I've done.

41:05.262 --> 41:06.490
- Hey, there.
- Here you go.

41:06.564 --> 41:07.861
Don't rub it on your leg like that.

41:07.932 --> 41:11.095
We got chores to do, Rosco.
It ain't easy being a simple farmer.

41:11.168 --> 41:14.660
No, no, this is an unacceptable...
Give me that moonshine.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.571
Yeah, I got to get that door fixed, Rosco.
Sorry about that.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.768
- See you next time.
- I know there's shine in here.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.335
- Hey!
- Oh, wait, Rosco.

41:22.413 --> 41:25.177
Maybe next time you can chase us
like a real cop.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.774
You let them go, little Flash honey.

41:29.653 --> 41:33.453
Don't you burn rubber on me!
I know where you live!

41:35.259 --> 41:37.659
Hey! Hey, now...

41:39.597 --> 41:42.589
Hey, this is Rosco.
We got some shiners on the run.

41:45.402 --> 41:48.769
Looks like y'all were right, boys.
They're locking up people.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.841
J.D. Had Rosco run off all our customers.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.775
Ain't right, them scaring people.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.210
Well, this is getting way too dangerous.

41:56.280 --> 42:00.216
- That could be y'all in jail, or even worse.
- Don't say it, Uncle Jesse.

42:00.284 --> 42:03.151
I'm not about to send y'all home
to your folks in wooden boxes,

42:03.220 --> 42:06.053
and this farm ain't worth saving
if we got to lose you boys.

42:06.123 --> 42:09.251
- There's got to be something we can do.
- Maybe there is.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.355
I got a couple of suits at home
that might fit y'all.

42:12.429 --> 42:16.923
What do you say we pay old J.D. A visit?
It might be time to call a truce.

42:30.514 --> 42:33.950
Oh, my gosh. You boys look like
you just fell off a wedding cake.

42:34.018 --> 42:36.418
Thanks, Daisy. What're you doing?

42:36.720 --> 42:39.120
Hughie ain't rejecting me again.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.498
Hot enough for you, Hughie?

43:38.282 --> 43:42.378
What's the point? I should be a nun.

43:42.586 --> 43:45.316
<i>Doesn't Daisy look mighty discouraged?</i>

43:45.389 --> 43:47.448
<i>But some lessons
you got to learn by yourself.</i>

43:47.524 --> 43:50.152
<i>You leave a spark alone
you might just find yourself</i>

43:50.227 --> 43:52.320
<i>in the middle of a raging inferno.</i>

44:01.605 --> 44:05.507
<i>So while one Duke is on a quest
to find her inner hotness,</i>

44:05.576 --> 44:07.669
<i>the other Dukes are about to get
all hot and bothered</i>

44:07.745 --> 44:12.307
<i>by a first-class culinary experience
care of Mrs. Lulu Hogg.</i>

44:12.383 --> 44:14.874
So, you boys ever roasted a turkey before?

44:15.252 --> 44:18.653
- No, Miss Hogg.
- Oh, please, call me Lulu.

44:20.057 --> 44:24.016
It's Arabic for pearl.
You know where to find a pearl?

44:25.329 --> 44:28.298
Open a clam, spread the fleshy pink meat
with your fingers,

44:28.365 --> 44:30.356
and find something beautiful.

44:31.068 --> 44:34.663
<i>You know it's summer,
'cause this woman's in heat</i>

44:34.872 --> 44:36.567
<i>and insane.</i>

44:38.676 --> 44:40.906
You keep this up,
you're gonna get my boys hurt.

44:40.978 --> 44:44.106
Your boys are riding shine,
not a-riding ponies.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.773
Getting hurt's part of the territory.

44:46.650 --> 44:48.675
Now we pat her dry, boys.

44:48.752 --> 44:53.951
Not that she don't enjoy being wet,
but she likes to have her bottom patted.

44:56.126 --> 44:57.718
There. Come on, Luke.

44:57.828 --> 45:00.922
Yeah, go on, Luke. Don't be shy.
You love to cook.

45:03.333 --> 45:05.858
That's Hazzard Mountain over there.
You remember we flipped that car

45:05.936 --> 45:07.801
seven times.
Shook our brains up a little bit,

45:07.871 --> 45:11.307
we still got up and delivered that load
on time, on foot. Remember that?

45:11.375 --> 45:13.775
- Ancient history.
- Well, I don't forget things like that.

45:13.844 --> 45:15.937
You done broke the pact
that we used to live by.

45:16.013 --> 45:17.742
You don't hurt a fellow moonshiner.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.783
You broke the pact when you ended
our business arrangement.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.841
Now that you aren't a friend of J.D. Hogg,

45:21.919 --> 45:25.514
you're finding Hazzard to be lonelier
than a chubby kid at space camp.

45:25.589 --> 45:30.151
Now, you wanna stuff her body cavity.

45:31.729 --> 45:32.923
Come on.

45:34.765 --> 45:37.495
Stuff it good. Good.

45:38.135 --> 45:42.265
You try to get deep inside there.
Come on, now. Get on up in there.

45:42.873 --> 45:45.569
- Get it in there, Luke. Come on.
- Come on now.

45:45.642 --> 45:47.906
- Go on in there.
- Come on, Luke. Don't be shy.

45:47.978 --> 45:50.446
- Okay.
- Stick it in there. Come on.

45:50.681 --> 45:52.012
Come on, Luke.

46:02.726 --> 46:06.025
Look, Jesse loses control. Can he recover?

46:06.096 --> 46:09.554
You're gonna let this personal feud
between you and I get out of hand.

46:09.633 --> 46:10.759
You got a dry county,

46:10.834 --> 46:13.462
and you're arresting moonshiners.
These are nice guys.

46:13.537 --> 46:16.062
Your moonshining days are over.
It's time for a new career.

46:16.140 --> 46:18.540
How about farming?

46:18.809 --> 46:22.370
Oh, hell, that's right.
You've only got the farm a few more days.

46:22.479 --> 46:26.074
Jesse crashes and burns.
Our condolences to his family.

46:26.150 --> 46:30.985
But the unbeatable, undeniable J.D. Hogg
takes his victory lap,

46:31.822 --> 46:35.952
collects a million dollars
and shags a movie star.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.654
Yeah, you're in a pickle, Jesse.

46:47.304 --> 46:48.771
It's amazing.

46:49.173 --> 46:52.142
You are single and down for anything.

46:52.876 --> 46:55.743
Any girl would love to snatch you up.

46:55.813 --> 46:59.010
He's right.
Now for the most important part.

46:59.116 --> 47:03.280
We baste her with hot juices.
She loves getting basted.

47:03.854 --> 47:05.082
There you go.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.691
Oh, God.

47:13.063 --> 47:16.999
Sis, where is Flashy
and his little squeaky toy?

47:17.067 --> 47:19.592
<i>You know,
the one that looks like a bandido?</i>

47:24.775 --> 47:27.209
You fellas wait right here
while I go get my gun.

47:27.277 --> 47:30.872
Dear brother, you are in my home 'cause
your wife tossed you out on your ear.

47:30.948 --> 47:34.406
Now, if you don't want to sleep
at the jail, leave these boys alone.

47:34.484 --> 47:36.384
These hoodlums are trespassing.

47:36.453 --> 47:39.286
As far as I'm concerned, they are innocent

47:39.356 --> 47:41.916
until someone else
is proven more adorable.

47:43.126 --> 47:46.254
Well, I'm gonna nail
you Dukes hard from behind

47:46.396 --> 47:48.330
when you least expect it.

47:48.398 --> 47:49.456
Kinky.

47:51.635 --> 47:53.398
All right, boys, come on,
let's get out of here.

47:53.470 --> 47:55.734
Y'all let me know
if you need any job applications.

47:55.806 --> 47:58.274
I do own a few businesses in town.

47:58.342 --> 48:01.539
You come back any time, Luke.
You'll be my special helper.

48:01.845 --> 48:03.278
Oh, he'll be back.

48:05.282 --> 48:08.740
- When do we bust them, Boss?
- Don't you worry, Rosco.

48:08.819 --> 48:11.185
If I know Jesse,
he ain't done cooking shine

48:11.255 --> 48:14.088
until they plant his corpse
with the spring crops.

48:16.894 --> 48:20.057
I want to show you boys
something that I'm real proud of.

48:20.230 --> 48:22.061
We'll take your word for it.

48:22.699 --> 48:26.226
I've been working long and hard
to make this one come out right.

48:26.570 --> 48:29.038
Okay, that's disgusting.

48:30.207 --> 48:32.732
This is where we hide the Duke still.

48:35.545 --> 48:39.003
<i>Welcome to the place
where dreams are made.</i>

48:39.283 --> 48:41.808
<i>And illegally bottled and sold at a profit.</i>

48:43.820 --> 48:46.789
Luke, I have a feeling
that we are about to see

48:46.857 --> 48:50.122
how the VIPs are treated at this farm.

48:50.994 --> 48:53.827
This old still has been in our family
for over 100 years, boys.

48:53.897 --> 48:56.127
It makes the best shine in the county.

48:56.199 --> 48:58.099
Back during Prohibition,
Great Grandpa Duke

48:58.168 --> 49:00.068
called together a meeting
of all the shiners.

49:00.137 --> 49:02.765
It was his idea to sell a lot at one time
and make enough money

49:02.839 --> 49:04.272
to get through the winter.

49:04.341 --> 49:08.437
- Genius. A flea market for moonshiners.
- Yeah, kind of like a Shine Mart.

49:08.512 --> 49:12.039
Well, this is our last shot, boys. So
we got to make a lot in the next 24 hours.

49:12.115 --> 49:14.811
Let's not waste any time.
Let's go get Daisy.

49:14.885 --> 49:15.874
Wait.

49:16.753 --> 49:19.244
Leave Daisy alone. She's got her heart set
on that job at the Nest,

49:19.323 --> 49:22.588
and I ain't seen her this passionate
since she played the Virgin Mary

49:22.659 --> 49:24.388
at the Christmas pageant.

49:30.400 --> 49:33.665
Ain't nothing exciting
ever gonna happen around here again.

49:37.641 --> 49:38.630
Shit!

49:57.728 --> 49:59.525
I want a job here.

50:00.430 --> 50:01.624
Done.

50:03.133 --> 50:05.294
I want you take me out tomorrow night.

50:05.369 --> 50:06.700
Done.

50:09.539 --> 50:11.905
Hey, what's your cell phone number
so I can call you.

50:11.975 --> 50:15.433
Cell phone? Oh, you can reach me by CB.

50:15.779 --> 50:19.545
My handle is Bo Peep.

50:21.585 --> 50:23.519
Y'all have a pleasant evening.

50:26.223 --> 50:28.714
You can put your eyeballs
back in your head.

50:37.134 --> 50:41.901
<i>Shine Mart, where the community comes
for bull rides, booze and breasts.</i>

50:41.972 --> 50:44.463
<i>That's what I call real family values.</i>

50:44.841 --> 50:47.742
<i>Attention, folks.
If you drank Ugly Andy's shine,</i>

50:47.911 --> 50:50.971
<i>you might want to report to the medic's
tent 'cause you got two minutes to live.</i>

50:51.048 --> 50:53.346
<i>But tonight's not all about fun.</i>

50:53.417 --> 50:56.181
<i>This is the Dukes'last shot
at saving the farm.</i>

50:56.253 --> 50:58.813
Nice bouquet. Slightly fruity.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.483
Burns your balls off. Makes you blind.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.219
I'll take six cases.

51:18.308 --> 51:20.242
Hey, it's Uncle Jesse!

51:22.012 --> 51:23.604
Yeah, Uncle Jesse!

51:46.937 --> 51:50.304
- Cooter!
- Hey, Candy Corn

51:50.407 --> 51:54.207
and Licorice Stick. Nicknames.
Use them or lose them. Your choice.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.272
Oh, hang on.

51:57.848 --> 52:00.043
She's going to pick a dance partner.

52:00.584 --> 52:02.745
Pick me! Cooter can dance!

52:03.353 --> 52:05.116
Right here! Got my hand up!

52:05.188 --> 52:08.646
Come on, right here!
I'll make you red hot! I'll get you going!

52:08.758 --> 52:11.249
Come on! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

52:11.328 --> 52:14.354
- Have you seen enough?
- I think so.

52:15.499 --> 52:16.659
Come on.

52:16.733 --> 52:20.726
<i>Folks, there's a pickup truck,
license plate, Shiner Sixty-Niner.</i>

52:20.837 --> 52:22.304
<i>Your lights are on.</i>

52:24.808 --> 52:25.797
Red hot!

52:49.866 --> 52:51.993
You got somebody you want to call?

52:53.470 --> 52:56.439
Well, if you weren't right here, I'd call you.

52:57.474 --> 52:59.908
But since you're right here...

53:08.118 --> 53:09.642
You wanna go inside?

53:16.593 --> 53:20.927
All I want is one taste
of that sweet, fiery nectar.

53:21.164 --> 53:23.598
- I know!
- Come here. I wanna tell y'all something.

53:23.667 --> 53:27.865
First Shine Mart we had over here,
Feds come in to bust us,

53:28.104 --> 53:31.665
but they couldn't find no evidence.
Me and Grandpa Duke drank it all up.

53:31.741 --> 53:35.677
I was blind for four days.
I couldn't see a goddamn thing.

53:35.745 --> 53:37.406
I didn't have no hands,
I didn't have no legs.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.107
Just kind of floated around for a while.

53:39.182 --> 53:40.809
Said they found me the next morning,

53:40.884 --> 53:43.785
I was bumping a six-row cultivator
all night long.

53:45.288 --> 53:47.586
So why can't we drink shine?

53:48.191 --> 53:51.718
Your folks don't want y'all drinking shine.
You can't handle it.

53:51.828 --> 53:54.763
A couple of little cuties there that might
want to go for a roll in the hay.

53:54.831 --> 53:57.163
You got my permission
to do that if you want to.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.225
And Duke 'em one time for Uncle Jesse.

53:59.302 --> 54:01.998
- You got it, Uncle Jesse.
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.436
I'm waiting.

54:07.744 --> 54:10.440
- How long?
- Till marriage.

54:12.649 --> 54:14.640
We have to keep our clothes on.

54:16.019 --> 54:18.146
You mean dry-humping?

54:19.422 --> 54:21.014
In layman's terms...

54:27.197 --> 54:30.689
We need a blueprint, a strategy
to get inside these girls' hearts

54:30.767 --> 54:32.291
and their pants.

54:33.737 --> 54:35.830
There's those cute boys again.

54:36.139 --> 54:39.108
Of course, what about being spontaneous?

54:39.175 --> 54:43.669
Just go up, startle them, terrify them,
say the first thing that comes to our head.

54:43.747 --> 54:45.408
I can't do that.

54:46.149 --> 54:49.880
If I can ask questions
and pretend to listen,

54:49.953 --> 54:53.354
then you can go up to Ali Handy
like a commando with a death wish

54:53.423 --> 54:55.550
on his last mission.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.954
- Yeah.
- Go.

55:00.897 --> 55:03.092
Ali Handy?

55:03.266 --> 55:07.430
Me and you is like nitroglycerin
and diatomaceous earth.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.971
Pure dynamite when combined.

55:11.608 --> 55:15.374
- You care to join me for a bull ride?
- No.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.738
I'll watch.

55:18.948 --> 55:22.509
I bet you're pure sex on a bull.

55:29.859 --> 55:31.520
Oh, to be young again.

55:33.596 --> 55:35.826
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.600
Ask away, then.

55:41.171 --> 55:44.902
What is all this about alternative energy?

55:45.742 --> 55:48.939
And how do you keep your ass so firm?

55:50.447 --> 55:52.074
Want to get comatosed?

55:54.017 --> 55:57.350
So that's what firewater tastes like.
Good stuff.

56:06.663 --> 56:08.494
That was amazing.

56:09.265 --> 56:11.665
We'll have to try that wet sometime.

56:12.302 --> 56:16.534
- You'll have to put a ring on my finger.
- That is incredibly hot.

56:17.807 --> 56:19.331
Let's get drunk.

56:19.709 --> 56:23.543
- I ain't never got drunk before.
- It's a night of firsts, huh?

56:25.014 --> 56:28.506
I heard your uncle makes
the best moonshine in the state.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.120
- Where did you hear that?
- It's a small town.

56:33.289 --> 56:36.747
Hey, Daisy, you can trust me.

56:37.827 --> 56:39.522
I'm not like other guys.

56:41.531 --> 56:43.624
You can't tell a soul.

56:44.801 --> 56:46.462
Promise?

56:49.506 --> 56:50.632
Promise.

56:50.707 --> 56:53.870
<i>Something here stinks, and it ain't me.</i>

57:08.758 --> 57:11.921
I'm blind.
The damn shine makes you blind.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.920
They've never been drunk before, huh?

57:14.998 --> 57:17.831
Like all boys,
they've never been a lot of things.

57:18.134 --> 57:21.501
Sophisticated, graceful or...

57:23.173 --> 57:25.300
You'll wake the stars.

57:26.176 --> 57:29.043
They're real pretty stars.
Makes me wanna cry.

57:29.179 --> 57:31.147
Hey, let's do another shot.

57:37.387 --> 57:40.618
I swear the boys in this town...

57:40.824 --> 57:42.655
- Cops.
- Cops.

57:54.504 --> 57:56.631
Hold it right there, now!

57:57.507 --> 57:59.668
We got a moonshine party, Boss.

58:00.043 --> 58:03.240
All right, everybody!
Hold it! Freeze! Freeze!

58:03.446 --> 58:05.437
Look at them all running.

58:06.149 --> 58:07.582
Wilma...

58:08.751 --> 58:12.278
Shouldn't you be home with the kids?
My, my, my.

58:13.490 --> 58:16.220
All right, y'all want the good news
or the bad news first?

58:16.292 --> 58:19.193
Well, the good news is
this heat spell's supposed to lighten up.

58:19.262 --> 58:23.892
The bad news is
you're all going to jail tonight.

58:24.801 --> 58:26.234
- Boss?
- Yeah?

58:26.436 --> 58:29.030
I don't think them Duke boys is here, Boss.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.497
You ain't ruining my special night, Rosco.

58:32.976 --> 58:35.604
Now we'll get them, sooner or later.

58:36.045 --> 58:41.005
But for now, this prom queen
is going to enjoy his special moment.

58:41.117 --> 58:42.345
Excuse me.

58:45.655 --> 58:48.715
'Cause the reason is sitting right here.

58:49.626 --> 58:52.094
What in the world's happened to you, J.D.?

58:52.161 --> 58:54.288
Oh, no, call me "Boss."

59:00.603 --> 59:02.093
Where are the girls?

59:08.444 --> 59:11.140
Damn it. I still have my underwear on.

59:11.714 --> 59:14.547
Man, Shine Mart was awesome last night.

59:14.851 --> 59:17.012
I don't remember anything about it.

59:18.421 --> 59:20.548
Uncle Jesse is going to be pissed.

59:25.828 --> 59:29.161
- Oh, my God!
- I wonder what happened.

59:29.732 --> 59:31.666
We better go find Uncle Jesse.

59:37.774 --> 59:39.537
Look awful nice, girl.

59:42.011 --> 59:44.479
All right, knock it off back there, boys.

59:47.150 --> 59:49.015
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

59:49.085 --> 59:51.280
Well, you're missing 99%/º of your pants.

59:51.354 --> 59:54.323
And the other 1%/º is covering
your magic part.

59:54.524 --> 59:58.426
Well, I like the way they make me feel.
Hughie likes them.

59:58.494 --> 59:59.927
Of course he does.

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.930
- Uncle Jesse.
- Easy there, Twiggy.

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:07.632
Now, you will keep your hands off
the zoo critters. Hmm?

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:12.203
Now you got five minutes to do
what youse gots to do.

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.204
We're sorry, Uncle Jesse.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.144
We never should have
left you there at Shine Mart.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:21.775
Then you'd be in jail with me now.
I'm sorry I got y'all into this.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.911
- I was a big fool to do that.
- So how y'all holding up?

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:27.149
Well, these old guys
ain't got no business in here.

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:29.350
They got farms and families at home.

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:30.824
Well, worry no more.

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:34.021
We have got
a foolproof plan to bust you out.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:39.427
All right, so I'm going to rig this jail
with 500 pounds of military-grade C-4,

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:41.868
blast a hole big enough
for the General to drive through...

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:46.875
Yeah, yeah, I got you. But why don't you
just catch a bus and go back home?

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:49.241
You need to lean on us
like we lean on you.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.507
Never abandon a fellow runner.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.440
I'll tell you what we might do.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.954
J.D. Has got a lot of important papers
over at his house.

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:02.423
And I know he's up to something.
That would be a good place to start.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.222
'Cause once a shiner, always a shiner.

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:07.194
All right. We'll go up there right now.

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.128
Be careful. Don't run in there too quick.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.598
- Be smart.
- Be strong.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:17.902
<i>Now why would an old moonshiner
like J.D. Hogg lock up Uncle Jesse?</i>

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:22.468
<i>That's what the boys are here to find out.
But first they got to distract Lulu.</i>

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:25.639
<i>And that's up to Luke,
and he ain't exactly thrilled.</i>

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:28.650
<i>See, Lulu is only distracted by two things.</i>

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.949
<i>Barbecue and hot, succulent boys.</i>

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.421
Stop worrying and roll with it.

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:37.253
Trust your instincts.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.796
I don't have instincts. I have plans.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:42.995
At least I used to, until now.

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:45.762
All we got to do
is stall Lulu for 10 minutes,

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.233
then we're gone.

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:50.032
I mean, what could happen
in 10 minutes, right?

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.615
- Hi, boys.
- Howdy, Lulu.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:04.278
- You are looking fine today.
- Thank you.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.653
Can I be your

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:17.963
- special helper?
- Oh, yes. Come. Come on.

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:26.942
It was sweet of Bo
to give us some alone time.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:30.307
Oh, yeah, he's... He's real generous.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:36.708
You know, you and Boss look real happy.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.851
Our wedding photo. J.D. Neglects me.

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:43.621
He can't help it, though.
That's why we never had any kids.

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:47.156
What... You're telling me
the most powerful man in Hazzard is...

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.356
Yup.

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:53.624
His testicles shut down the sperm bank
and sent all the workers to China.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.997
Now, mind if I slip into something more...

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.742
Comfortable?

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:05.542
I was gonna say boner-inducing, but
comfortable is a polite way of putting it.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:14.879
<i>While Luke's learning the fine art of
seducing the mentally deranged upstairs,</i>

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:17.687
<i>Bo's searching for evidence downstairs.</i>

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.691
This is for Uncle Jesse.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.628
I can do this, man. This is for Uncle Jesse.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.725
Yeah, for Uncle Jesse.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.031
<i>Come to mamacita. Come on.</i>

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:43.544
Yeah?

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:47.880
Luke, is this your first time?

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:51.584
First time?
Oh, I've slept with a thousand women.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.424
- Oh, yeah?
- Of all kinds, too.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.862
Sometimes I feel like I work for the UN.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:58.162
And I've done every position.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.003
I've even invented a few myself.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.502
Boss, you fiend.

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:11.206
First time? That's funny.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.113
Well, honey, you're more fidgety
than a queer rooster

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.481
in an undersexed henhouse, huh?

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:19.020
Look, if you wanna take a breather
and go downstairs,

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.146
we can go get Bo.

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:22.282
No, no! I want you now.

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.087
Oh, oh, Luke.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.286
<i>Looks like J.D. 's serious</i>

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.298
<i>about replacing beers with milkshakes.</i>

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.994
<i>Then again,
things ain't always what they seem.</i>

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:35.230
<i>That's the golden rule in Hazzard.</i>

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.640
You shut the door one more time,

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:50.311
I'll marinate you, grill you
and eat your ass for supper. Goodbye!

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:53.779
Luke.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:54.948
Luke!

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.647
<i>You are going to die!</i>

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.988
<i>Luke, come in!</i>

01:04:58.127 --> 01:05:03.030
Lulu, my steamed dumpling!
Big Daddy Trouble's home!

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:08.133
Damn! What's going on?
Oh, you Duke boys are in trouble now!

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:10.734
<i>Pull out!</i>

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.702
Pull out!

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.035
Big Daddy Trouble's coming, Lulu!

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.172
- Oh, Big Daddy Trouble, save me, save me!
- Now, Big Daddy Trouble,

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.943
I was just paying Miss Hogg here
a friendly visit.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:24.453
Oh, you're gonna pay a friendly visit
to the emergency room.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:27.786
Oh, my...

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.351
Come on, Luke!

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.387
Come back and see me again!

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.365
Rosco, I'm being invaded by Dukes!

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.303
You messing with me, boys, huh?

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.342
Take that for coming after with my wife!

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.776
Luke!

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.070
I'm coming, Boss.

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.478
Good, Rosco, quick!

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:55.244
Get after them, them Duke boys.
You won't believe what happened!

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.980
Put the dog down,
take my car, go after them!

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:02.184
- You were gonna leave me again!
- You forgot to fill the tank again.

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.719
- I'm coming for you boys!
- Oh, man!

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.564
Move over!

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:17.902
Oh, I'm ready now.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.202
What is that?

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.799
Shit-shine ball.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:31.845
Shit!

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:37.091
I'm backing, I'm backing, I'm backing!

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.626
Keep your eyes on the road!

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.889
Eyes? Who needs eyes?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.594
Whoa! "Vote for Boss?"

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.167
Lean to the left! Lean to the left!

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.868
Drive somewhere!

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:56.344
That was fast!

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:57.768
Go!

01:06:58.814 --> 01:06:59.940
They're getting...

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.142
Rosco!

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.515
St. Peter, I'm here.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.554
Rosco! What are you doing?

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:11.855
They'll be drinking margaritas in Mexico
by the time you finish with your nap!

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:16.328
Flash had a little puppy meatloaf, Boss.

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.960
That's the sickest thing I've seen today.
Get this thing cleaned up!

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.403
God! Good Lord!

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:36.218
So, this is awkward.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.980
This day never happened, all right?

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.481
If someone ask us
what happened on this day,

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:45.254
we'll say,
"That's the day we went bowling!"

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:48.558
And not the day that Lulu Hogg rode you
like a Minotaur?

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.429
Exactly.

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.625
Not that day.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.895
<i>Got your ears on, Lost Sheep?</i>

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.006
Got our ears on and eyes peeled.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.838
<i>Listen, fellas,
something strange is going on here.</i>

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.004
<i>I saw boxes being delivered
by armed deputies.</i>

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.106
<i>Sort of odd in a place
where lemon sorbet is on the menu.</i>

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.447
Hang on, Daisy, we'll be there later.

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:12.954
First, we gotta dress up for the occasion.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.523
Rosco.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:25.167
You still stink.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:28.362
You stink so bad,
your kids' kids are gonna stink,

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.234
if anyone'll procreate with you,
which I doubt.

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:35.265
Now, come on, Boss,
I did my very, very best.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:39.212
Rosco, if I want advice
on letting criminals escape,

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.680
I'll call you.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.008
Calm down.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:47.453
Them Dukes. They assaulted my boar,
they violated the sanctity of my home,

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:50.151
and they molested
my tender flower of a wife.

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:52.524
Oh, yeah, Boss, I can picture it now.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:56.497
Their greasy little fingers
running all over her hot buttocks

01:08:56.564 --> 01:08:59.693
like a chubby kid looking for chicken wings
in the bottom of a basket.

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:00.928
Rosco!

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:05.604
You dummy, I don't wanna
imagine the circumstance.

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:07.598
I want them in jail!

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.001
Can you do that? Can you just...

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:13.810
I got enough worries
with my ice cream parlor investors.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.612
Just add more deputies.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:18.015
Do whatever it takes. I can't rest

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:21.488
until their gonads are scattered
to the four corners of Hazzard.

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:25.725
<i>Hazzard's a place
where dreams do come true.</i>

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:28.991
<i>Bo and Luke got famous.
Just the wrong way.</i>

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.095
<i>Enos finally got deputized.</i>

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:34.568
<i>A hall monitor with a gun. Lord save us.</i>

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:41.368
<i>With their faces plastered all over town,
the boys figured they needed a makeover.</i>

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:44.011
Why the hell do I have to wear the skirt?

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.837
Because you have nicer legs.

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:47.939
Thank you.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:51.885
<i>No way to sugarcoat it,
they make damn fine-Iooking women.</i>

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.081
Get over and talk to them right now,
you hear me, boy?

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:55.248
All right.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.856
Excuse me.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.594
You ladies don't look
like you're from around here.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:02.324
- Can I help?
- Yes...

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:06.000
I'm Detective Amanda Smith

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:09.333
and this is my partner, Anita Davington.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.906
We're with the Federal Bureau
of Frozen Delights,

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.671
and we are conducting an investigation.

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.268
Federal agents?

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.411
I'm Deputy Enos Strate.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:23.679
You know, you ought to talk to Daisy.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.985
She's real nice.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.284
Here she comes now.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:33.921
If you need any further assistance,
just give me a holler.

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:40.965
Here's the key to Boss Hogg's office.

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:45.104
Now, hold on there one minute, little lady.

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:50.675
Failure to dance with the sheriff
is a crime here in Hazzard County,

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:54.978
punishable by 10 years
in a maximum-security prison.

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.078
Now, my ex, she chucked
this old poon hound to the curb

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:02.783
like a perp charged on indecent exposure,

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:07.022
failure to communicate,
and wagon wheels on a wing nut.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:14.365
She thinks upholding the law
is the only thing I care about.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.938
But I do have my other passions.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.606
Don't get fresh, Sheriff.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.004
Oh, my.

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:30.151
You have a grip like an anaconda.

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:33.781
I bet you could swallow me whole, too.

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:44.064
Come on, let's go.

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:46.833
<i>The boys' wigs got them in.</i>

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:50.770
<i>But it was time to leave
the distracting work to a professional.</i>

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:55.105
<i>You ain't never gonna look at a sundae
the same way again.</i>

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.437
Oh, baby.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.570
Oh, my.

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:03.183
Yeah, that's cold, all right.

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.753
Cool me down.

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:20.896
Sweet.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.671
Rosco shouldn't treat a lady like that.

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:31.406
- Now you're a lady?
- No, but I should be treated like one.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.345
Oh, man, these hose are killing me.

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.211
Man, that's hot.

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:04.273
Hey, look, look at that.

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.048
Well, how's it coming with the investors?

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:16.182
It's just a matter of time
before the other commissioners

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.748
turn the whole state dry.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:20.920
No one resists the Hogg, John,
including Daisy Duke.

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:23.556
It was a lot more fun
finding out about their still

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:26.863
from that hot piece of tail
than those hillbillies, Bo and Luke.

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:30.371
In less than 24 hours,
we are foreclosing on that Duke farm

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:32.066
and take that still.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.769
Then you'll add your premium shine.

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:37.971
You know, before you go
on your rounds in the morning,

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.573
stop by the Boar's Nest.
I got a present for my favorite nephew.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:43.249
Hughie's a Hogg.

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:50.047
- Daisy.
- Oh, Daisy.

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.251
Daisy, wait!

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.228
- I can't believe what a jerk he is!
- Daisy, wait!

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.897
I know you wanna wrap your thighs
around his chest

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.060
and squeeze the air out of him,

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:02.433
so do I.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:04.404
But we cannot let him know
we're on to him.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:07.533
We gotta follow Hughie
and see where he takes us, okay?

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.774
- I'll kill him with my bare hands!
- No, Daisy!

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:13.337
You'll get your chance with Hughie.

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:17.441
Right now,
we gotta think about Uncle Jesse.

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.356
Sorry, Daisy.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:26.322
They have messed with me
at the wrong time of the month.

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.391
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.992
<i>Hughie's a no-good, two-faced Hogg
and Boss is still in the shine business.</i>

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.093
<i>With everybody locked up
and the state going dry,</i>

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.604
<i>there'll be one place in town
to get good and hammered,</i>

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.698
<i>the Boar's Nest ice cream parlor.</i>

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.801
<i>Hogg will make a killing, but Bo and Luke
are hoping handsome Hughie</i>

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:45.972
<i>will lead them right to Boss's shine stash
so they can stop him.</i>

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:47.515
<i>Do you follow?</i>

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:50.279
<i>I never said this was going to be easy.</i>

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:55.549
We'll lose him if he gets too far ahead!

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:56.818
I can't get too close.

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:59.087
Driving's second nature to me, Luke.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.995
Orange car. Smart pick, boys, smart pick.

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:13.371
- What the hell?
- I can't see anything.

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.433
Hughie is burning some dust.

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.850
I can feel the road. Snake coming.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.546
You can feel the road?

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:27.589
Oh! Damn it, Bo, be careful!

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.419
I got it! I got it!

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.489
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.303
Oh, man!

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:54.145
Beautiful driving.
You know, you come a long way.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.945
Your instincts are worthless.

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:58.612
- I thought I had him.
- Oh, you lost him.

01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:01.884
You lost our best chance of nailing Boss
and getting Uncle Jesse out.

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:06.291
Plan all you want, but somebody's gotta
actually drive and do something.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:11.263
So you're the smart one, congrats.
What'd that get us, huh?

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.359
You know I should have left you
at the farm that first night.

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:16.836
Now I'm stuck here with an idiot.

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.497
I'm gone.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:23.907
That's what you're good at.

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.604
Leaving people behind.

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:28.639
Go! No one's gonna miss you.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.746
Now maybe I can finally get laid.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.521
<i>You know something ain't right</i>

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:39.527
<i>when Bo kicks
the thing he loves most in the world.</i>

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:43.929
<i>In fact, I'd say there ain't a whole lot
that is right in Hazzard at the moment.</i>

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.225
<i>Poor Uncle Jesse,</i>

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:52.137
<i>just sitting in the clink
wishing he was on the farm he loves.</i>

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.935
<i>Poor hot, juicy Daisy.</i>

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:58.411
<i>First, Hughie foreclosed on her heart,</i>

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.846
<i>then Rosco foreclosed on the farm.</i>

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:22.234
<i>And so, things didn't turn out
exactly like we hoped for the Dukes.</i>

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.471
<i>Ain't that the way life is sometimes?</i>

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:27.900
Thanks! Thanks a lot!

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.715
Oh, I got it. I got it, Bo!

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:42.006
I can't follow you, Luke.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.652
I can't cross that line.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.280
I love Hazzard.

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:51.121
I love my hair in the Hazzard sun.

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:54.060
I love Daisy and Uncle Jesse.

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:56.996
I love the smell of pig shit in the morning.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:01.161
I love the feel of the General Lee's hood
on my tight, toned butt.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:06.063
Let's forget that all happened, all right?

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:10.210
Heat of the moment.
It'll never happen again.

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.479
- That truck wasn't cold.
- What truck?

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:20.954
A Hogg ice cream truck just drove by.
I hit it with my hand and it was warm.

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:24.856
It's kind of hard to keep ice cream cold
with a truck with no freezer.

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:30.429
Okay, I really am the good-looking one.
Explain.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:34.560
Hogg's using the truck to transport shine.
It's a cover.

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.900
And I bet I know
where he's keeping that shine.

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:39.736
Hogg's Ravine, the ice cream factory!

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.841
Come on. Let's go find Daisy and Cooter.

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:48.613
The farm belongs to Boss at noon.

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.947
That doesn't give us much time.

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:55.319
- I'm so stupid for falling for Hughie.
- You're not stupid, Daisy.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.858
You're the smartest person I know.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.527
He made me feel pretty.

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:04.491
You don't need some big city jackass
to tell you you're pretty.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:05.590
Yeah.

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:08.158
Hell, Luke and I wanted
to get nasty with you several times

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:10.704
till we realized you were our cousin.

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:13.563
Actually, that didn't even matter to Luke.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.409
It's true.

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:18.568
Thanks, boys.

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:21.315
So what are we gonna do?

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:24.841
We are gonna get Boss to pay for the farm
out of his own pocket.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.945
And why would he do that?

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:31.120
<i>Nothing prettier than a good plan
coming together amongst friends.</i>

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:36.221
<i>I know y'all are anxious to hear about it,
but that'd ruin the surprise.</i>

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:38.832
Well, it ain't perfect.

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.398
The General's hurt.

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:45.538
I can't believe I'm gonna let you leave
with the seats all torn.

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:47.302
It breaks my damn heart.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:51.635
And hopefully, she'll last long enough
for us to do what we gotta do.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.109
Hope's all we got.

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:56.480
Hope and a prayer.

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:58.944
And a dream.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.989
- Hope and a prayer and a dream.
- Okay, we got it, Cooter.

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:03.752
- Thank you, buddy.
- Okay.

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.624
Be careful.

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.663
<i>Election day in Hazzard,</i>

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.700
<i>where folks are expected to vote early</i>

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:15.702
<i>and vote often for Jefferson Davis Hogg.</i>

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:19.640
What a beautiful day for democracy
here in Hazzard.

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:22.567
<i>Here's part one of the plan.</i>

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:25.738
<i>Y'all are gonna see what they mean
by beauty and brains.</i>

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:26.940
Hi, Deputy.

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.612
Anything exciting happening?

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.248
I don't really get to leave the station,
so this is...

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:39.521
Well, I bet there's a lot
of important police business here.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:43.528
- Wanna show me around?
- Oh, yes, please.

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:51.661
Every voter is going to get a coupon
good for $1.00 off

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.935
at Hogg's Car Wash and Delicatessen.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.140
Let's get high on the Hogg!

01:21:57.345 --> 01:21:59.745
<i>Part two, Cooter's no philosopher,</i>

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:02.840
<i>but he can handle a tow truck
with the grace of a figure skater.</i>

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.943
Now all the commissioners here,

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:08.387
we've gotten together and they've seen
how we're living in Hazzard.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:11.323
It's pure, simple, it's good.

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:14.885
One hand on the Bible,
the other hand on the plow.

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:21.068
That's why we've all banded together
to turn our glorious state dry.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:25.567
Now, this is just the beginning
of a program that I...

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:31.303
<i>Part three, Bo, Luke and the General Lee.</i>

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:34.507
<i>The perfect marriage of men and machine.</i>

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:39.343
Well, if it ain't the Duke boys
come to turn themself in!

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:40.649
Rosco...

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:42.082
<i>Now, Cooter.</i>

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.118
What the...

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:52.732
Oh, boy, are you all right?

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.029
Howdy, Boss.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:58.064
Oh, you Dukes are gonna
face the firing squad for this.

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.367
Get in.

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.070
Go, Bo.

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.609
<i>Attention all units.</i>

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:12.483
<i>Two male suspects driving
a kick-ass orange '69 Charger</i>

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:15.580
<i>are believed to have kidnapped
Commissioner Hogg.</i>

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.750
<i>All units respond.</i>

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.289
Enjoy the sunny day.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:32.338
This here
is the emergency broadcast system.

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:35.001
In case of emergency, I get on the horn,

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:38.273
they send me in there,
or I make the call, I mean...

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.507
I ain't never seen one of these before.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:43.551
I don't think you should be playing
with that, Daisy.

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:48.216
- Enos, hand me that screwdriver.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.600
You can slow down any time you want!

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:02.033
We got no reason to live!

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:05.129
You've taken the farm from us,
locked up my Uncle Jesse,

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:06.434
now you got us on the run.

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.942
You plowed my wife's field
you sexual miscreant.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:10.136
You should burn at the stake!

01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:12.475
We'd rather be the famous outlaws

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.378
that died in a police chase.

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:19.252
Unless you tell us
about your shine business!

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.788
That's a good one!
I ain't telling you Dukes a thing!

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:24.791
It's either jail or the cemetery
for two no-good bums like you.

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:27.350
Guess we'll take the cemetery, then!

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:48.641
Yeah!

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.487
Those darn Duke boys.

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.250
It don't get any better than this!

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.859
We got them now!

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:16.503
This is Rosco P. Coltrane,
and I'm in hot pursuit of them Duke boys.

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.175
He shot us!

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.889
"Protect and serve," my ass!

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:32.851
Hot damn!

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.559
Get their tires!
Don't shoot me, you stupid...

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.095
Hot damn! I'm alive!

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.378
What are you doing?

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.247
Wait! You ain't gonna do it!

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:58.308
Boss, you got anything you'd like to say
to your maker, now's a good time.

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:00.952
You ready, Daisy?

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:02.951
10-4. Go for it, Luke.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.057
You're bluffing!

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:09.219
Don't do it! No!

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:15.958
What...

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.042
Getting close, Boss.

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:31.512
Okay! Okay, I...
I locked up your uncle so I could...

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:34.952
So I could run a monopoly, shine
monopoly out of the Boar's Nest, see?

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.719
<i>- Then I'd watch these normal people...
- He's a pig!</i>

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:40.090
<i>... spending their hard-earned dollars!</i>

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.223
Decent people

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:46.256
<i>spending their money there!
Are you happy?</i>

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.596
<i>Are you happy? Is that a crime?</i>

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:53.371
<i>You boys did it!
Everyone in town heard Boss.</i>

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:55.841
Why, you dirty, filthy, conniving Dukes!

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:59.477
Well, it don't matter, though.
You need a little thing called evidence.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.139
Then we got one more thing to do!

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.843
No you don't! No you don't!

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:03.906
No!

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:09.014
<i>They're heading back for the ravine!
They're gonna die!</i>

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:12.249
Jump that already! Jump it!

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:49.822
Damn!

01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:59.006
<i>Kind of a nifty plan, huh?</i>

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:02.531
<i>See, the boys just found
Boss Hogg's shine operation.</i>

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.339
<i>You know what that means.</i>

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.805
Excuse me.

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.248
<i>I hope Boss brought his checkbook.</i>

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.554
Oh, boy.

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:24.627
<i>Folks were mighty tired
of all the shenanigans.</i>

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:27.532
<i>So, Boss was forced to let the shiners go.</i>

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:30.335
Whoa! Hey.

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.370
Well, well, well.

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:36.972
Looks like little bluebird is ready to fly.

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:38.945
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.513
It's the boys and the girl. How are you?

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:44.209
You know, your folks sent y'all down here
to learn to be gentlemen,

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:46.583
you wind up breaking the law,
running shine

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:48.986
and doing a damn good job of it, too,
I might add.

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:51.218
Let's blow this pop stand, come on.

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:54.424
You good-for-nothing.

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.828
Take it all in, Hughie

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:04.702
'cause they don't serve anything this fine
in here.

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:10.170
Oh, wait, wait, wait. No, no.

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:13.145
Daisy, I'm available for conjugal visits.
Daisy!

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:16.508
<i>And since someone
needed to take the fall,</i>

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:20.350
<i>Boss set up Hughie
as his personal Humpty Dumpty.</i>

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:35.563
On one...

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:39.367
<i>The voters weren't too happy
when they learned what Hogg was up to.</i>

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.465
<i>So they saw fit to elect a better man.</i>

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:43.169
<i>An honest man.</i>

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:45.940
<i>A dead man.</i>

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:49.546
<i>Turned out the shock of winning
was too much for old man Abernathy.</i>

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:51.608
<i>May he rest in peace.</i>

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:56.213
<i>So the voters, in their infinite wisdom,
put Boss back in office,</i>

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:59.123
<i>figuring the devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.</i>

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:00.683
Get your hand off of there now.

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:04.789
<i>His first official act was to pardon himself
of all wrongdoing.</i>

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.429
<i>Boss regretted offering that reward
for uncovering shine.</i>

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.631
<i>He figured nobody'd ever catch on to him.</i>

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:14.368
<i>Then, again, he never figured
on Bo and Luke.</i>

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:17.275
<i>They used the reward
to buy back the farm.</i>

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:25.650
<i>Bo finally found someone who appreciated
his particular driving skills.</i>

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.413
Wait! Did I pass?

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.420
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:42.962
<i>While Luke found the one gal impressed
by a fella who can blow shit up.</i>

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:52.335
<i>Looks like he'll finally lose his virginity,</i>

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:56.578
<i>and to someone
who doesn't sexually abuse poultry.</i>

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:03.583
<i>Uncle Jesse told the kids
he was quitting the shine business</i>

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:06.855
<i>to spend the rest of his days
as a simple farmer.</i>

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:10.026
<i>They should have known
that didn't smell right.</i>

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:12.759
<i>Once a shiner, always a shiner.</i>

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:14.802
Race you to the General!

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.171
Hey, where y'all going?

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.469
- We'll be back!
- Don't wait up!

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.533
<i>You know the moment in your life</i>

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:27.672
<i>when you realize you're exactly
where you're meant to be?</i>

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:31.240
<i>Hazzard's a place
where two good old boys with a fast car</i>

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.379
<i>can really make a name for themselves.</i>

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:55.571
- Floor it, Bo. Floor it!
- Damn!

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.213
All right!

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.761
I don't understand what's going on.

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.937
Those Duke sons of bitches!

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.374
Oh, shit!

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:34.844
Well, you dirty son of a bitch...

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.550
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:40.849
You two sure are pretty.

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.920
Stop hanging around, you little monkey.

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.465
Fucking around is all I ever care about.

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:58.772
We didn't wanna hit your dog.

01:32:58.839 --> 01:33:03.867
Was I talking to you there, circle of life,
golden hair, zebra-eating freak?

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:06.072
Rosco!

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:07.842
Flash had a little

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:10.549
chip wiggle, Boss.

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:17.817
Was I talking to you,
blueberry cobbler ass?

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.720
- Gonads scattered in a...
- Stop.

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.156
Stop it right there.

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:28.258
I love grease and scattered gonads, Boss.

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:32.905
Come on! Come here, come here.

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:35.033
You hide behind those pigtails
and those braces.

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.600
Come on, come on! I can take her!

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:39.211
You got two weeks,

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.714
then I'm sending Rosco out
to foreclose on the farm.

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.716
And you call yourself a Mason.

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:45.983
Yes, I do.

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:54.620
That's the sickest thing I've seen today.
Get this thing cleaned up!

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:57.255
We cleaning, Boss, we cleaning.

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:03.103
When you say shine, your eyes go
all buggy like a retarded dragonfly.

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:08.705
Hey, can I drive, Uncle Jesse?
I just got my learner's permit.

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:14.446
Looks like you got
a little more learning to do.

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.574
Besides that, that ain't my car.

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:24.048
God, you don't have to push me around
like a dirty, fat kid...

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.926
That's a scary-ass pig.

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:30.463
It's really funny
until you have your hand chewed off.

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:32.192
All right, this is just for the outtakes.

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:33.494
The cemetery.

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:36.593
You might wanna try some of that mouth
to snout while you're down here.

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:38.639
Come on, Flash, honey.

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:43.336
Let's go get some little greeny-weenies,
some Chinese schoolboys.

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.512
Oh, no, call me "Boss."

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:51.041
I got you, Boss, right here in my britches.

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:57.481
This is Rosco P. Coltrane,
production fuck-stick.

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:01.318
Marker.

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.731
- You got all tongue-tied, Boss?
- I sure did, yeah.

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:10.934
Did you step in something, son,
because there's some kind of...

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:13.465
Help.

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.906
Oh, shit.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.237
There goes my career!

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.835
It's suicide. It's suicide.

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:21.074
I gotta... I gotta get out!
