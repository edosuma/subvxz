01:53.573 --> 01:56.951
<i>What is the goal of the life?</i>

01:58.745 --> 02:02.165
<i>It's to create yourself a soul.</i>

02:04.918 --> 02:07.712
<i>For me, movies are an art...</i>

02:08.213 --> 02:10.840
<i>more than an industry.</i>

02:12.634 --> 02:16.095
<i>And it's the search of the human soul...</i>

02:16.262 --> 02:19.140
<i>as painting, as literature, as poetry.</i>

02:22.685 --> 02:24.938
<i>Movies are that for me.</i>

02:47.335 --> 02:53.424
<i>I wanted to make a film...</i>

02:53.591 --> 02:59.180
<i>that would give the people
who took LSD at that time...</i>

02:59.347 --> 03:04.352
<i>the hallucinations that you get 
with that drug, but without hallucinating.</i>

03:04.519 --> 03:09.816
<i>I did not want LSD to be taken,
I wanted to fabricate the drug's effects.</i>

03:09.983 --> 03:14.737
<i>This film was going to change
the public's perceptions.</i>

03:25.039 --> 03:28.001
<i>My ambition with</i> Dune <i>was tremendous.</i>

03:29.752 --> 03:33.715
<i>So, what I wanted was to create a prophet.</i>

03:35.508 --> 03:38.386
I want to create a prophet...

03:38.553 --> 03:43.433
to change the young minds
of all the world.

03:43.808 --> 03:48.980
For me, <i>Dune</i> will be the coming of a God.

03:49.898 --> 03:54.235
<i>Artistical, cinematographical God.</i>

03:54.986 --> 03:58.072
<i>For me, it was not to make a picture.</i>

03:58.781 --> 04:00.825
<i>It was something deeper.</i>

04:00.992 --> 04:04.495
I wanted to make something sacred...

04:06.164 --> 04:10.418
free, with new perspective.

04:10.627 --> 04:12.712
Open the mind!

04:12.879 --> 04:18.676
Because I feel, in that time, myself, 
inside a prison.

04:18.885 --> 04:22.889
My ego, my intellect, I want to open!

04:23.890 --> 04:28.353
And I start the fight to make <i>Dune.</i>

04:47.997 --> 04:50.500
<i>You needed a touch of madness to do it.</i>

04:50.708 --> 04:53.044
<i>You can't have a masterpiece without madness.</i>

04:53.211 --> 04:55.088
Pink Floyd? <i>Dali...</i>

04:55.254 --> 04:57.006
<i>or Orson Welles or others!</i>

04:58.299 --> 05:00.343
Maybe <i>Dune</i> had too much madness?

05:01.886 --> 05:04.305
But a movie that doesn't have a bit of madness...

05:04.472 --> 05:06.474
is not going to conquer the whole world.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.825
I don't think that in the history of cinema...

06:47.992 --> 06:52.205
there was ever a film that was taken that far, 
only to end up not being made.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.207
To become a different film,
since a film was made...

06:54.373 --> 06:57.376
that had nothing to do with those
two and a half years of work.

07:19.649 --> 07:22.235
<i>In the beginning, I was making theater.</i>

07:26.364 --> 07:29.534
<i>In Mexico, I make 100 theater plays.</i>

07:32.078 --> 07:35.623
<i>In 10 years, I make the avant garde theater.</i>

07:35.790 --> 07:38.459
Ionesco, Beckett, Strindberg.

07:39.836 --> 07:42.421
Modern adaptations of Shakespeare, I do.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.632
One day I will make a picture.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.343
<i>When I came to pictures...</i>

08:29.510 --> 08:32.013
<i>I came like a virgin.</i>

08:33.054 --> 08:37.058
<i>Without to know technical movement.</i>

08:37.226 --> 08:39.812
<i>I didn't know lens, the number.
I didn't know.</i>

08:45.443 --> 08:49.697
<i>We shoot</i> Fando Y Lis, <i>hiding of unions.</i>

08:52.450 --> 08:55.077
<i>In Mexico, a young director 
cannot make picture...</i>

08:55.244 --> 08:58.664
<i>without the permission
of the old director unions.</i>

08:58.831 --> 09:03.002
I say, "What, I need to take
the permission to make art?"

09:04.253 --> 09:06.881
Artists need to be free! I do my picture!

09:07.048 --> 09:09.759
<i>Then was a great scandal later, eh?</i>

09:10.176 --> 09:13.387
Because I broke all the unions, I did it!

09:19.810 --> 09:23.231
I was opening the mind of the industry.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.303
<i>I was exposed to it
in the underground cinema in New York.</i>

10:35.469 --> 10:39.640
<i>And after that, we had the courage
to attempt to distribute it in France...</i>

10:39.807 --> 10:45.396
<i>and it was an incredible success for this movie 
that was quite revolutionary...</i>

10:45.563 --> 10:49.817
and a natural friendship was born
between Alejandro and me.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.777
Thanks to the success of <i>El Topo</i>...

10:51.944 --> 10:55.448
I got one million dollars to make 
<i>The Holy Mountain.</i>

11:01.370 --> 11:03.122
<i>I did whatever I wanted.</i>

11:03.873 --> 11:04.999
<i>I didn't have a producer...</i>

11:07.168 --> 11:10.004
<i>no critic, no one to mess with me.</i>

11:11.714 --> 11:15.083
<i>I did what I wanted 
and it was</i> The Holy Mountain.

11:44.622 --> 11:48.250
<i>I gave the movie to Michel Seydoux in France.</i>

11:48.417 --> 11:52.505
And, oh, surprise, in Europe 
it attracted a great number of people...

11:53.381 --> 11:55.341
<i>it was playing openly.</i>

11:56.092 --> 12:01.097
<i>In Italy that year, 
it was the number two movie behind James Bond.</i>

12:01.931 --> 12:05.101
The Holy Mountain <i>was incredible.</i>

12:11.107 --> 12:15.444
<i>So my ambition grew.</i>

12:42.179 --> 12:45.850
<i>Michel Seydoux called me from Paris
and say to me:</i>

12:46.016 --> 12:50.229
"Holy Mountain <i>is a success.
I want to make a new picture with you.</i>

12:50.396 --> 12:52.356
<i>Do whatever you want!"</i>

12:57.820 --> 13:00.698
I have never made movies or transactions...

13:00.865 --> 13:02.783
unless there was something more to them.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.287
A relationship between human beings
is what makes the difference.

13:08.122 --> 13:11.459
<i>He said, "I want to produce you anything.</i>

13:11.667 --> 13:13.419
<i>What do you want to do?"</i>

13:14.003 --> 13:15.629
I say, <i>"Dune!"</i>

13:15.921 --> 13:17.173
And he say, "Yes."

13:21.760 --> 13:22.928
<i>Why?</i>

13:23.095 --> 13:26.474
<i>Because the book was 
the most beautiful science-fiction book.</i>

13:26.640 --> 13:29.935
<i>It was the bible of science fiction
for all the big devotees.</i>

13:30.102 --> 13:32.771
Because the book had been
a worldwide publishing success...

13:33.522 --> 13:35.274
<i>that you could find in every country.</i>

13:37.026 --> 13:40.988
I didn't read <i>Dune.</i> 
But I have a friend who say me it was fantastic.

13:41.155 --> 13:44.200
I don't know why I say <i>Dune.</i>
I can say <i>Don Quixote...</i>

13:44.366 --> 13:48.245
or I can said Hamlet.
I don't know anything.

13:48.621 --> 13:49.830
I say <i>Dune.</i>

14:46.720 --> 14:48.556
Hollywood sold us the rights for nothing...

14:48.722 --> 14:51.767
mockingly on the inside, I believe...

14:52.643 --> 14:56.021
thinking that we would never be able 
to carry out such a thing.

14:58.941 --> 15:02.194
<i>It was a great undertaking to do the script.</i>

15:05.614 --> 15:08.784
<i>Michel Seydoux brought me to France.</i>

15:08.951 --> 15:11.412
<i>He rented a castle, a huge castle...</i>

15:11.579 --> 15:16.083
<i>and I was in that castle
dedicated solely to</i> Dune.

15:17.668 --> 15:21.213
<i>Frank Herbert created a world in</i> Dune...

15:21.547 --> 15:24.925
but he never said exactly what it was.

15:25.092 --> 15:29.221
And you have a hundred pages of literature...

15:29.763 --> 15:32.474
where you go on to discover,
with great difficulty...

15:32.641 --> 15:34.393
what the book is about.

15:35.019 --> 15:41.317
It's very-- It's like-- 
I compare it to Proust in French literature.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.902
It's literary, it's great literature.

15:46.864 --> 15:49.617
<i>The first 100 pages...</i>

15:50.117 --> 15:52.119
you understand almost nothing.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.706
It's insinuations.

15:57.082 --> 16:01.795
To bring literature to image
is completely difficult.

16:01.962 --> 16:08.344
You need to create another world,
the optical world.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.929
It's not the literary, auditive world.

16:13.265 --> 16:17.269
<i>All the time, even in the...
in the little details...</i>

16:17.770 --> 16:23.400
<i>I was trying to find
the spiritual meaning of that picture.</i>

16:33.661 --> 16:36.163
<i>Now I have my script.</i>

16:37.748 --> 16:40.250
I need to find the warriors.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.630
The warriors to do it.

16:44.797 --> 16:49.760
Every person who will work in this picture
will be a spiritual warrior.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.137
The best I will find.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.182
He had the genius to make...

16:57.059 --> 16:58.852
a storyboard with Moebius.

17:04.858 --> 17:08.028
I find a comic book.
The comic book was...

17:09.113 --> 17:10.446
<i>Blueberry.</i>

17:11.156 --> 17:14.159
<i>Cowboy book, drawing by Giraud.</i>

17:15.285 --> 17:18.539
I start to see, but that guy is my camera!

17:20.165 --> 17:21.165
<i>Who is this?</i>

17:34.304 --> 17:36.140
This is the person I need.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.810
Where I will find this person? Where?

17:41.311 --> 17:44.565
In that time was not Internet
to find any person.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.692
I need to find this person.

17:48.569 --> 17:53.824
I went to see my agent, publicity agent...

17:53.991 --> 17:56.994
and there he was. By chance.

17:57.161 --> 17:58.871
He was there.

17:59.371 --> 18:00.789
He say, "I am Moebius."

18:00.956 --> 18:05.085
<i>"When I drawing science fiction,
I am not Giraud, I am Moebius."</i>

18:06.003 --> 18:10.090
And I say to him,
"You are the person! Come with me!"

18:13.635 --> 18:16.680
<i>Drawing by drawing, I shoot the picture.</i>

18:20.726 --> 18:23.061
<i>I need 3000 drawings.</i>

18:24.480 --> 18:27.274
<i>Point of view. Movement of the camera.</i>

18:28.484 --> 18:31.487
<i>Dialogue. The relation between the actors.</i>

18:32.863 --> 18:35.407
<i>I use Moebius like a camera.</i>

18:36.450 --> 18:41.330
<i>I take Moebius, I say,
"Now you advance." "Now you travel."</i>

18:43.582 --> 18:45.667
<i>"Now you make a close-up."</i>

18:49.254 --> 18:52.841
I have Moebius, who was a genius.
Moebius was a genius.

18:53.133 --> 18:58.222
Because he was not only an artist
with an incredible capacity...

18:58.722 --> 19:00.641
but he was very quick.

19:04.186 --> 19:08.357
Was superhuman. He was...

19:08.524 --> 19:10.651
quickly, <i>rapido,</i> incredible.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.027
And then I could shoot.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.864
Every day, we start to shoot...

19:16.031 --> 19:21.453
at 8:00, we come, we prepare everything.
I think at 9:30 we start to shoot.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.500
<i>I made the picture with drawings.</i>

19:46.186 --> 19:50.566
<i>And then in the costume, I say to him--
I describe what I wanted.</i>

19:51.108 --> 19:53.694
<i>He immediately:</i>

19:53.861 --> 19:58.031
<i>Quick, more than a computer.
He was incredible.</i>

20:27.519 --> 20:31.189
Everything became magic
when we was doing this picture.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.026
Everything, everything.

20:38.363 --> 20:43.493
<i>Dune,</i> my <i>Dune,</i> start with a long shot.

20:44.161 --> 20:49.791
I admire the long shot
of Orson Welles' <i>Touch of Evil.</i>

20:50.250 --> 20:55.212
<i>The camera go, go, go, 
traverse the street, go.</i>

20:55.672 --> 20:58.759
<i>It's a fantastic big, long shot.</i>

21:00.302 --> 21:03.013
<i>And then I wanted to start</i> Dune
<i>with a long shot...</i>

21:04.222 --> 21:08.769
better than the long shot of Orson Welles.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.979
I wanted to go farthest.

21:11.146 --> 21:16.485
And then all the shot
is traversing the whole universe.

21:16.818 --> 21:21.573
You go there and you traverse
all the galaxy, all the galaxy...

21:21.740 --> 21:25.369
and in traversal of the galaxy,
you see a pirate...

21:25.953 --> 21:33.543
robbing a convoy of spice, by example.
Battles. And you go, you go...

21:34.753 --> 21:35.754
<i>Is a long shot.</i>

23:53.767 --> 23:57.729
We need to find the person
who will make the special effects.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.690
<i>I say, "Moebius, we fly
to California, to Los Angeles...</i>

24:00.857 --> 24:04.027
<i>to the appointment of Douglas Trumbull."</i>

24:21.086 --> 24:25.423
He was a very honored,
very important person.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.927
<i>He receive me. He was interesting.</i>

24:29.094 --> 24:30.137
<i>Was a business.</i>

25:00.125 --> 25:01.710
We went to see Trumbull...

25:02.544 --> 25:06.298
but he gives himself so big importance.

25:07.048 --> 25:09.342
We was speaking, he answered...

25:09.509 --> 25:12.637
4O times the telephone. Forty times.

25:14.931 --> 25:19.728
He was speaking with so big vanity of himself.

25:20.437 --> 25:24.608
He was a big technician.
But for me, was not a spiritual person.

25:25.233 --> 25:29.863
He have nothing to do in the creation of a film 
who was a prophet.

25:30.488 --> 25:33.158
He will make a technical film, no?

25:53.845 --> 25:57.224
And then I say, "I cannot work with you."

25:58.350 --> 25:59.809
And we went out.

26:00.518 --> 26:05.023
<i>Moebius was astonished, say,
"How you can say no to the biggest...</i>

26:05.190 --> 26:07.984
technician of Hollywood?"

26:08.151 --> 26:11.154
I say, "It is like that."

26:11.321 --> 26:14.157
<i>I cannot use him.
He is not my spiritual warrior.</i>

26:17.160 --> 26:21.581
<i>And then we was walking in the street, Hollywood...</i>

26:21.873 --> 26:27.921
<i>there was a little cinema, a little theater.
And there was a science-fiction picture...</i>

26:28.088 --> 26:29.130
Dark Star.

26:37.514 --> 26:40.016
<i>And when I see the picture,
"That is the guy!"</i>

26:43.687 --> 26:44.854
<i>O'Bannon.</i>

26:46.356 --> 26:50.277
We will search for this person.
This person will be the person.

27:15.635 --> 27:19.514
For me, the art was before, later the technique.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.933
And that was O'Bannon.

29:11.334 --> 29:14.254
And then he came to Paris.

29:14.421 --> 29:20.051
And that was-- I have two warriors:
Moebius and O'Bannon.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.053
I need to find the others.

29:22.846 --> 29:27.016
<i>The first actor is the father, 
the Duke Leto.</i>

29:41.906 --> 29:45.702
<i>David Carradine had starred
in a very popular television series...</i>

29:46.536 --> 29:47.912
<i>in which he was a warrior...</i>

29:48.079 --> 29:49.789
<i>who was taught by masters from the Orient.</i>

29:51.166 --> 29:52.959
<i>It was influenced by</i> El Topo.

29:54.752 --> 29:59.632
Then, when Carradine knew
that I wanted him, he came...

30:00.133 --> 30:01.259
he came running.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.973
<i>I waited for him in Los Angeles,
in a hotel room.</i>

30:07.140 --> 30:09.934
I had bought vitamin E.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.647
Like, this E vitamin. Half a kilo.

30:16.900 --> 30:22.113
In order to take one pill every day
to have the strength.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.574
<i>Carradine came to my room,
the first thing he saw...</i>

30:24.741 --> 30:28.077
<i>was the pot of E vitamin.</i>

30:28.244 --> 30:29.829
He say, "Oh, E vitamin!"

30:31.372 --> 30:35.752
And he drink all my pills of vitamin E!

30:35.919 --> 30:40.381
Like is a monstrosity! Sixty dollars was!

30:43.384 --> 30:46.137
Well, was a big beginning.

30:46.596 --> 30:48.515
And then I say,
"We need to work together!

30:48.681 --> 30:50.808
You are the person I am searching!"

30:57.315 --> 31:00.652
I wanted a musical group for every planet.

31:02.445 --> 31:05.573
Pink Floyd.
<i>They will make the music of Leto.</i>

31:08.535 --> 31:12.247
Pink Floyd <i>have a record,</i>
Dark Side of the Moon.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.791
<i>For me, that is the human being,
like the moon.</i>

31:14.958 --> 31:17.252
<i>One side is brilliant, light.</i>

31:17.418 --> 31:20.380
And the other side who is black, the unconscious...

31:20.547 --> 31:23.925
what is mysterious, what is deep.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.845
It happened during a meeting.

31:28.012 --> 31:31.140
"Pink Floyd?"
<i>Gibon said, "Okay, I'll go!"</i>

31:31.307 --> 31:35.728
<i>He called</i> Pink Floyd's <i>agent.
He said, "Could I meet with you?"</i>

31:35.895 --> 31:38.690
<i>So one day we went to London.</i>

31:39.482 --> 31:42.402
They were in the middle of finishing the mixing...

31:42.860 --> 31:47.905
of <i>Dark Side of the Moon,</i>
at Abbey Road, the famous studio.

31:49.867 --> 31:53.413
And I remember, we got there...

31:53.997 --> 31:56.499
and they were very standoffish...

31:56.666 --> 31:58.543
pop stars, very distant.

31:58.710 --> 32:02.797
They was eating. They was eating...

32:02.964 --> 32:06.217
hamburgers. Four guys eating hamburgers.

32:06.384 --> 32:08.886
"Hello," they say, "Hello!"

32:10.305 --> 32:13.099
And nothing, I could not speak,
they was eating.

32:13.266 --> 32:16.394
All of a sudden, Jodo--
We called him Jodo.

32:16.561 --> 32:20.189
Jodo said,
"No. They're pissing me off. Let's go!"

32:20.356 --> 32:22.483
I start to insulted them.

32:22.650 --> 32:28.031
"How you don't understand I offer to you...

32:28.948 --> 32:34.370
the most important picture
in the history of the humanity!

32:35.288 --> 32:36.789
We will change the world!

32:36.956 --> 32:39.167
And you are eating...

32:39.334 --> 32:43.713
eating Big Macs. How?"

32:44.339 --> 32:48.217
And then they stop
and they speak with me.

32:49.385 --> 32:52.305
And after that, it went very, very well.

32:52.472 --> 32:53.765
Very, very well, yeah.

32:53.931 --> 32:57.769
And we was speaking to make a big album 
with the music of <i>Dune.</i>

32:59.520 --> 33:00.980
Could be fantastic, no?

33:03.816 --> 33:07.111
<i>In my version, the Duke Leto...</i>

33:10.198 --> 33:12.116
he is castrated.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.911
And then how he will do a son?

33:15.787 --> 33:17.205
<i>And then his wife...</i>

33:17.914 --> 33:21.668
a marvelous woman, a wise woman...

33:23.002 --> 33:28.091
<i>and the guy have a love, 
a cosmic love when he see this woman.</i>

33:28.257 --> 33:30.426
<i>And how he will make a child?</i>

33:30.593 --> 33:34.263
<i>And she take a drop of his blood...</i>

33:34.430 --> 33:40.144
<i>and she change the blood into semen...</i>

33:40.603 --> 33:46.859
<i>and then we see the drop of blood
going inside the vagina, the uterus...</i>

33:47.068 --> 33:48.986
<i>and we will follow the blood...</i>

33:49.153 --> 33:55.493
<i>the blood coming and go inside the ovum 
and explodes there.</i>

33:58.079 --> 34:01.207
<i>She get pregnant with a drop of blood.</i>

34:01.791 --> 34:03.209
<i>That's what I did.</i>

34:08.047 --> 34:12.635
<i>What will have if you are not the son 
of a sexual pleasure...</i>

34:14.053 --> 34:16.097
<i>but of a spiritual pleasure?</i>

34:17.889 --> 34:22.186
<i>And from this spiritual love,
he will create Paul.</i>

34:23.730 --> 34:26.524
<i>Paul was a young boy...</i>

34:27.734 --> 34:32.071
<i>but is not a normal boy. Was a mutant.</i>

34:32.237 --> 34:35.908
<i>With a big soul and strength.</i>

34:37.409 --> 34:39.245
Where I will find that boy?

34:39.411 --> 34:40.538
My son.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.172
Today you are 7 years old.

34:49.338 --> 34:50.672
Now you are a man.

34:51.424 --> 34:54.010
Bury your first toy and your mother's picture.

35:01.726 --> 35:05.563
I work with him in <i>El Topo</i>,
now he have 12 year old.

35:05.730 --> 35:10.109
<i>I say, "You will make Paul,
but you need to prepare as a warrior."</i>

35:19.285 --> 35:23.080
I prepare my son, to do the role exactly...

35:23.247 --> 35:27.418
as the Duke Leto prepare his son.

35:41.098 --> 35:42.975
I find teacher for him.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.103
I have a very strong person...

35:46.270 --> 35:47.730
<i>Jean-Pierre Vignau.</i>

35:49.148 --> 35:52.902
<i>When we started, he was 12.</i>

35:53.069 --> 35:55.738
There I trained him in karate,
karate jujitsu, Japanese style.

35:55.905 --> 35:57.782
That's all the fist-foot techniques...

36:00.117 --> 36:02.161
joint locks, floor pins, standing pins...

36:02.328 --> 36:05.289
a combination of karate,
judo, aikido and atemi-jitsu.

36:05.456 --> 36:11.254
He learned how to fight with his hands,
with knife, with swords.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.588
He learn all that.

36:14.715 --> 36:19.011
<i>And he was ready to do Paul
as a real "Paul."</i>

36:21.806 --> 36:26.143
I trained Brontis six hours a day,
seven days a week for two years.

36:42.577 --> 36:46.163
<i>And all the person say to me,
"But what you did?</i>

36:47.081 --> 36:49.750
<i>But why you are trying 
to change the mind...</i>

36:49.917 --> 36:53.087
<i>of child and to make a superior person?"</i>

36:56.883 --> 36:59.927
<i>I say, "No, I was only 
awakening the creativity."</i>

37:02.138 --> 37:04.265
<i>I opened his mind.</i>

37:04.432 --> 37:06.225
<i>That's what I was doing.</i>

37:06.392 --> 37:09.687
<i>I don't know if I changed his life.</i>

37:09.854 --> 37:12.773
Now I am thinking, "Why I did that?"

37:12.940 --> 37:14.442
Sacrifice my son.

37:15.234 --> 37:21.908
But in that time, I say, if I need to cut my arms 
in order to make that picture...

37:22.074 --> 37:24.452
I will cut my arms. I will do it.

37:25.161 --> 37:28.205
I was believing that to make a picture...

37:28.372 --> 37:35.171
who will give a mutation
to the young minds...

37:36.172 --> 37:39.508
was sacred. You need to sacrifice yourself.

37:40.134 --> 37:42.678
I was even ready to die doing that.

38:01.572 --> 38:06.911
<i>For me, science fiction
was like a huge theater...</i>

38:07.078 --> 38:09.580
<i>like a huge work of art.</i>

38:12.875 --> 38:15.795
Every spaceship was a being...

38:16.379 --> 38:20.049
like an insect, like a fabulous bird.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.386
<i>That was the spaceship I wanted.</i>

38:25.429 --> 38:29.600
<i>Foss, I knew him in the covers
of science-fiction books.</i>

38:30.434 --> 38:34.939
<i>They were ships with souls, like beings.</i>

38:36.190 --> 38:38.025
It had to be Chris Foss.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.588
You are excrement.

39:41.172 --> 39:43.299
You can change yourself into gold.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.999
In that time, I was like a prophet,
I was enlightened.

40:59.792 --> 41:04.463
And I gave to them the feeling
they are not only making a picture.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.842
They are making something important for humanity.

41:08.008 --> 41:10.136
They have a mission. They was warriors.

44:11.275 --> 44:16.572
I was searching for...
for the light of genius in every person...

44:16.739 --> 44:21.243
with an enormous respect,
an enormous respect.

44:21.410 --> 44:25.289
And then, every day
I was feeding them in order to...

44:25.456 --> 44:29.251
to be free, to do the best of them.

44:40.763 --> 44:45.267
Every morning, I give a big speech...

44:45.434 --> 44:51.398
like the person who make football or rugby...

44:51.565 --> 44:54.068
a speech with the players.

44:54.234 --> 44:58.322
Every morning, I make my speech.

44:58.489 --> 45:01.158
In order to say,
"Do it, what you need to do...

45:01.325 --> 45:04.495
really, because this will be important."

45:45.411 --> 45:49.456
In that time, I was seducing Dali...

45:49.623 --> 45:53.669
because I wanted Dali
as the mad emperor of the galaxy.

45:57.881 --> 46:01.051
Dali, to us, he seemed to be
the only emperor of the world...

46:01.218 --> 46:05.597
with that extraordinary talent,
with his speech and his wording.

46:06.974 --> 46:12.604
Can nobody understand Dali because myself, 
never understand my work.

46:12.771 --> 46:17.526
Never Dali understand
one painting of Dali...

46:17.693 --> 46:22.114
because Dali only create enigmas.

46:22.573 --> 46:24.533
Dali was something, eh?

46:29.663 --> 46:33.000
<i>The first time we went to New York
was with Michel Seydoux.</i>

46:34.585 --> 46:39.131
<i>We went to the St. Regis because
Michel Seydoux liked the St. Regis Hotel.</i>

46:40.257 --> 46:43.802
And we discovered that Dali
was also at the St. Regis Hotel!

46:43.969 --> 46:45.471
By chance.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.764
<i>I was reading a book about the Tarot.</i>

46:49.475 --> 46:52.811
And then I take a page where the Hanged Man...

46:55.689 --> 46:59.359
I write, "I want to see you because
I will make a picture with you."

46:59.610 --> 47:04.698
He like it. To have this kind of invitation.
He say, "I will see you.

47:05.449 --> 47:06.992
<i>I wait you in the bar."</i>

47:09.161 --> 47:12.289
<i>The bar had a 6-meter long painting...</i>

47:12.456 --> 47:15.083
<i>pre-Rafaelite, where there was a king...</i>

47:15.584 --> 47:21.673
and the nobles had a face
like they were hiding something.

47:22.799 --> 47:26.887
Dali told me, "I like it here because
there is a 6-meter painting...

47:27.054 --> 47:28.639
dedicated to a fart."

47:33.185 --> 47:36.480
Dali told me,
"We are going to see each other in Paris.

47:36.647 --> 47:38.357
I am going to think about it."

47:51.286 --> 47:55.999
In Paris, on the Champs Elysées,
there was a very fancy restaurant...

47:56.166 --> 47:59.211
<i>and he was there with his court.</i>

47:59.378 --> 48:03.632
<i>He had 12--
Twelve persons at the table and him.</i>

48:03.799 --> 48:07.844
"Sit down. I want to ask something to you."

48:08.345 --> 48:09.846
"What, Mr. Dali?"

48:10.847 --> 48:16.144
"When we was young, myself and Picasso, 
we went to the beach.

48:16.645 --> 48:19.606
And we open the door of the car...

48:19.773 --> 48:22.985
always in the sand, we find a clock."

48:24.528 --> 48:25.988
Clock, no?

48:26.405 --> 48:30.617
"Do you find, in your life,
a clock in the sand?"

48:32.327 --> 48:34.997
And I say, "What I can answer?"

48:35.163 --> 48:37.040
It was very quick, like this, because...

48:37.207 --> 48:39.751
all the 12 person are awaiting my question.

48:39.918 --> 48:43.213
Because if I say I find,
all the time, clocks...

48:43.922 --> 48:48.385
I will be a vanity person. Ridiculous.

48:48.802 --> 48:52.514
If I say I never find a clock,
I will be a poor guy.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.559
And suddenly came to me, I say:

48:55.726 --> 48:58.186
"I never find a clock.

48:58.687 --> 49:00.981
But I lost a lot."

49:03.942 --> 49:07.904
"Okay!" And then,
"I wait you in Barcelona!"

49:11.617 --> 49:13.243
<i>It was a game.</i>

49:14.328 --> 49:19.916
Also, Jodorowsky was part
of the surrealist movement...

49:20.083 --> 49:21.543
and Dali liked that.

49:21.710 --> 49:24.796
So it was a game between them.

49:24.963 --> 49:27.049
Who would win the game?

49:27.215 --> 49:29.635
He was going through his first adventure
with Amanda Lear...

49:29.801 --> 49:34.097
this sort of extraordinarily sexy person.

49:34.264 --> 49:36.558
<i>Nobody ever knew
if it was a man or a woman...</i>

49:36.725 --> 49:40.687
<i>a completely incredible character.</i>

49:42.230 --> 49:44.733
<i>A sort of muse, a poet's muse.</i>

50:02.793 --> 50:05.587
And you had to meet him,
you had to tame him...

50:05.754 --> 50:07.798
and he needed to tame you.

50:07.964 --> 50:11.093
So he would make you go
through these initiations each time.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.078
She treated me very well...

50:38.412 --> 50:40.080
and she became an ally...

50:40.247 --> 50:42.999
because I promised her the role
of Princess Irulan.

51:00.016 --> 51:04.896
She said,
"Be careful because Dali is destructive.

51:05.063 --> 51:07.899
If he says 'yes', he is going to do
everything to destroy the film."

51:36.887 --> 51:40.307
Dali say to me, "I will work with you...

51:40.474 --> 51:44.269
but I want to be the actor...

51:44.603 --> 51:46.980
best paid actor in Hollywood.

51:47.564 --> 51:52.527
I want $100,000 per hour."

51:52.986 --> 51:55.906
I went back and told Alejandro,
"We're never going to make it!"

51:56.072 --> 51:58.116
But I couldn't pay him 
"the most in the world."

51:58.283 --> 51:59.326
That would be impossible.

51:59.785 --> 52:00.994
Then step by step...

52:01.161 --> 52:02.579
because we were stubborn
and because Alejandro would tell me...

52:02.746 --> 52:04.790
that Dali was the only one
who could play the emperor...

52:05.540 --> 52:07.292
the totalitarian emperor...

52:08.376 --> 52:11.922
we had the idea of paying him...

52:12.088 --> 52:13.715
by the minutes used.

52:14.382 --> 52:15.884
I go to see Alejandro...

52:16.051 --> 52:17.594
and ask, "How many minutes
is he going to be filmed?

52:17.761 --> 52:19.930
How many minutes will he be in the movie?"

52:20.764 --> 52:25.060
Alejandro says,
"Maximum five, probably three."

52:25.769 --> 52:26.895
So I said, "That's the idea!"

52:27.103 --> 52:30.899
I go back to see Dali and I say,
"I will pay you $100,000 per minute!"

52:31.066 --> 52:36.196
He says, "That's brilliant!
I will be the $100,000 a minute actor!"

52:38.114 --> 52:42.202
I said, "I will take a mold of you,
hyper-realistic...

52:42.369 --> 52:45.288
and I will make the emperor of the galaxy...

52:45.455 --> 52:50.627
he is so afraid to be killed,
he have a robot. And the robot will act."

52:55.841 --> 52:59.636
And Dali said, "Yes, if you give me
the sculpture for my museum."

53:00.470 --> 53:04.307
"Okay." And then like this, I have Dali.

53:07.185 --> 53:12.941
And Dali, in our conversation,
show me a catalog of Giger.

53:14.192 --> 53:16.987
And he say to me,
"I think this person have a talent."

53:18.029 --> 53:21.032
I see that, I see-- 
But is incredible!

53:21.449 --> 53:24.661
Is what I am searching for the Harkonnen, 
for the bad guys.

53:25.787 --> 53:29.249
<i>The gothic planet, gothic characters.</i>

53:29.416 --> 53:33.003
And then I went to search Giger.

53:56.735 --> 54:04.868
Paris was where Jodorowsky and Dan O'Bannon 
saw my work displayed...

54:09.581 --> 54:15.962
and they wanted me to join them.

54:21.343 --> 54:23.637
Giger had never done movies.

54:24.721 --> 54:26.890
I said, "You have to make movies."

54:27.057 --> 54:32.896
It was completely new to me
and incredibly fascinating.

54:34.147 --> 54:37.567
<i>I say to Giger, "I need you as you are.</i>

54:37.734 --> 54:43.073
You are searching in the 
deepest darkness of the soul.

54:43.239 --> 54:45.575
<i>And that is good. That is your art.</i>

54:45.742 --> 54:49.788
<i>Your art is-- 
For me, is an ill art.</i>

54:49.955 --> 54:53.708
Marvelous, ill art,
necessary for the Baron Harkonnen."

54:55.418 --> 54:59.714
I met Jodorowsky for the first time in Paris.

54:59.881 --> 55:05.804
This was the evening when he attended...

55:05.971 --> 55:09.349
a <i>Magma</i> concert.

55:15.188 --> 55:19.859
<i>For the Harkonnen planet,
I chose here in Paris...</i>

55:20.026 --> 55:22.696
<i>a very famous group in that time, is</i> Magma.

55:23.905 --> 55:28.326
Magma <i>was gothic, military...</i>

55:30.161 --> 55:31.329
terrible.

55:35.291 --> 55:39.379
I knew nothing about the project,
or the idea...

55:40.755 --> 55:44.968
or the book for that matter.
I learned about all of that afterwards.

55:45.635 --> 55:49.764
<i>Alejandro Jodorowsky didn't give us
any direction on the music.</i>

55:49.973 --> 55:51.933
<i>I believe he trusted us.</i>

55:52.434 --> 55:58.231
Now, I had an idea because 
he had described the planet, the Harkonnen.

55:58.398 --> 56:00.358
I knew that they were not really the good guys...

56:00.525 --> 56:02.485
that they were more like the bad guys.

56:02.652 --> 56:04.738
So it was rather easy to imagine because...

56:05.488 --> 56:10.118
Magma <i>made music that was rather violent...</i>

56:10.285 --> 56:12.495
<i>typically hard, things like that.</i>

56:16.041 --> 56:20.295
I was just amazed by the quality...

56:20.462 --> 56:26.593
and I told them I felt just like Christ 
when he was on the cross.

56:26.760 --> 56:31.306
I was fulfilled, it was fascinating, the music.

56:33.266 --> 56:38.688
I was using the best musicians
of this time, from rock.

56:50.450 --> 56:54.871
<i>I wanted Mick Jagger to play
Feyd-Rautha, a character.</i>

57:00.168 --> 57:05.757
How am I going to contact this person...

57:05.924 --> 57:10.178
who is not going to be impressed 
that I have the great power to make a movie?

57:10.345 --> 57:15.725
He is in the peak of his fame, 
of his glory. How?

57:15.892 --> 57:19.896
And I was invited to an event in Paris.

57:20.063 --> 57:22.732
It was a big gathering of the Parisian bourgeoisie...

57:22.899 --> 57:25.068
and at the other side of the room,
a big room...

57:25.235 --> 57:29.114
I don't know, maybe 150 square meters...

57:29.572 --> 57:31.741
was Mick Jagger.

57:31.908 --> 57:35.829
I saw him from a distance
and I think he saw me...

57:35.995 --> 57:38.998
and I saw him walking,
he started walking--

57:39.165 --> 57:42.293
He started walking between the people...

57:42.502 --> 57:45.088
and then I realized 
that he was coming to me.

57:45.255 --> 57:48.925
He crossed the room
and he stood in front of me.

57:49.092 --> 57:51.594
<i>And I told him, 
"I want you for my movie."</i>

57:51.761 --> 57:54.806
<i>And he said only one word, "Yes."</i>

57:56.808 --> 58:01.229
I was often invited to Andy Warhol's Factory...

58:01.437 --> 58:03.773
Candy Darling, and all those people.

58:03.940 --> 58:08.945
<i>There I met Udo Kier,
who was Andy Warhol's great actor.</i>

58:13.032 --> 58:16.953
<i>He had played great roles,
and he said that he would act for me.</i>

59:42.121 --> 59:46.501
<i>Baron Harkonnen is a big, big monster...</i>

59:48.086 --> 59:51.881
<i>who have anti-gravitational implants...</i>

59:52.048 --> 59:54.884
<i>and he is in the air all the time
because he is too heavy.</i>

59:58.763 --> 01:00:00.265
Orson Welles.

01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:11.276
Orson Welles had a bad reputation...

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:15.989
because they said
that he liked to drink and eat...

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:18.908
so much that he ate at the movies.

01:00:19.075 --> 01:00:24.205
He ate a lot, and then he did not 
finish the movies, he was moody.

01:00:24.372 --> 01:00:29.210
But I said, "No, Orson Welles
is a genius, he is the one."

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:35.216
<i>And since he liked to eat, they say he goes
to the gastronomic restaurants in Paris.</i>

01:00:35.383 --> 01:00:39.595
<i>Therefore, I sent a secretary to ask...</i>

01:00:39.762 --> 01:00:44.100
<i>in all the gastronomic restaurants in Paris:</i>

01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:47.478
"Where does Orson Welles eat?"

01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:51.607
And we discover a restaurant
and then he was eating.

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:55.111
Six bottles of wine. He was eating.

01:00:55.278 --> 01:01:00.950
And then I asked to the chef,
"What is the best wine he want?"

01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:04.412
He say, "That."
Then, "Send him a bottle."

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:08.082
And then, he drink the bottle
and he want to speak with me.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.380
And then, I speak with all the respect,
because was for me was an idol.

01:01:15.006 --> 01:01:19.844
He say, "I don't want to do it.
I don't want any more."

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:24.932
I say to him, "I will propose something.

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:29.687
If you do the picture, 
even if we pay what you want as an actor...

01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:35.943
I will hire the chef of this restaurant
and you will eat, as here, every day."

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:37.820
And he say, "I do it."

01:01:42.158 --> 01:01:47.246
I had the artworks from the movie...

01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:53.669
which I got from Moebius, who drew the storyboard, 
where one can see...

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:57.173
<i>the Harkonnen Castle.</i>

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:02.470
<i>The castle was the big Baron Harkonnen, no? 
The big sculpture.</i>

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:06.808
That was where Baron Harkonnen lived.

01:02:06.974 --> 01:02:09.852
In himself! The big ego, no?

01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:17.193
The castle open the mouth,
a tongue go there, out...

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:21.114
and the spaceship came in the tongue.

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:44.846
<i>I was fascinated by the creation
of the Harkonnen people...</i>

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:51.727
<i>and when I airbrushed five paintings...</i>

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:57.692
<i>I gave my best to create these designs.</i>

01:03:22.175 --> 01:03:26.637
<i>In order to go to the castle,
there is a way with tubes.</i>

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:31.017
<i>Enormous tubes. Come out knife.</i>

01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:39.192
And then in order to go to the Baron Harkonnen, 
you need to walk this way...

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.238
escaping of the big knife
who want to destroy you.

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:50.411
If attacked, then the spears would be set in motion 
and impale the people...

01:03:50.578 --> 01:03:57.585
who stood in the way
on the pathway up the castle.

01:03:57.919 --> 01:04:04.342
And in fact this Harkonnen fortress
was never in the novel.

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:11.474
So this was somehow 
in Alejandro Jodorowsky's translation...

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:18.481
his interpretation of the story.

01:04:48.553 --> 01:04:52.306
When Paul get killed, he doesn't die because...

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:57.186
the Messiah is all the humanity
can get enlightened.

01:05:04.193 --> 01:05:10.366
<i>In the end, his mind is the mind
of every person. He's a plural being.</i>

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:14.870
I am the others. The others are me.

01:05:56.078 --> 01:05:58.998
And then, if the whole humanity get enlightened...

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:01.959
the Earth changed.

01:06:06.297 --> 01:06:08.257
<i>The planet of sand...</i>

01:06:08.424 --> 01:06:14.597
start to grow plant, animals,
be like a paradise.

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:36.369
<i>Dune</i> is a Messiah of the planets
because is a planet with consciousness.

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:38.663
With the same consciousness of Paul.

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.290
And the planet go to the universe...

01:06:41.457 --> 01:06:43.292
<i>to illuminate the other planets.</i>

01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:50.883
<i>I changed the end of the book, evidently!</i>

01:06:51.467 --> 01:06:53.386
In the book, it's a continuation.

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:56.138
The planet never changed.

01:06:57.515 --> 01:07:01.602
Is not awake, with a cosmic consciousness.

01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:04.855
It's not a Messiah, the planet. I did that.

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:07.983
<i>It's different. It was my</i> Dune.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:14.699
<i>When you make a picture,
you must not respect the novel.</i>

01:07:15.324 --> 01:07:17.702
It's like you get married, no?

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:21.497
You go with the wife, white, 
the woman is white...

01:07:21.664 --> 01:07:26.168
you take the woman, if you respect the woman, 
you will never have child.

01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:31.090
You need to open the costume and to...

01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:33.926
to rape the bride.

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:38.264
And then you will have your picture.

01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:43.519
I was raping Frank Herbert,
raping, like this!

01:07:43.686 --> 01:07:46.063
But with love, with love.

01:07:48.816 --> 01:07:50.693
And then I came with that.

01:07:54.447 --> 01:07:56.449
<i>It was such a beautiful object.</i>

01:07:56.615 --> 01:08:00.202
<i>So well done and at the time,
there were no photocopies.</i>

01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:02.747
<i>It was just photos of each drawing.</i>

01:08:03.205 --> 01:08:04.457
In color...

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.917
<i>so well done...</i>

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:12.256
with so much detail about the costumes, 
about the techniques used.

01:08:12.673 --> 01:08:16.010
Every studio have one book like this.
Every studio.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:19.095
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal,
everything, all them...

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:23.225
Michel Seydoux give a book like that.

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:28.564
This approach was chosen precisely because...

01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:33.194
I was thinking they might have
a certain distrust of Jodorowsky.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:38.115
But since we were showing the camera angles, 
since we explained each scene...

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:40.658
the way we wanted to film it...

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:42.661
they should have been relieved.

01:08:43.412 --> 01:08:46.081
But they weren't. It wasn't enough.

01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:57.426
<i>In Los Angeles, I wasn't optimistic.</i>

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.596
The thing is that sometimes
the French and the Americans...

01:09:01.764 --> 01:09:04.683
have difficult relationships, you know.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.769
Well, we have had.

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:12.899
We were almost at the finish line,
but we had to find the last $5 million.

01:09:13.776 --> 01:09:17.238
The film cost $15 million.
Well, we estimated it as $15...

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:22.868
<i>We had been invited to Walt Disney studios 
by the chairman of the board.</i>

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:27.122
<i>He looked through the project and said:</i>

01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:30.835
"This is a wonderful project...

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:33.420
but it is like the Concorde.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:37.299
It's an exceptional plane,
but over here, never!"

01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:42.429
And there I said to myself that
we were going to face a lot of problems.

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.794
<i>They always received us 
in a very friendly way...</i>

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:16.881
<i>but it was always the same answer.</i>

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.051
When we would give them the book,
they were very impressed.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.178
They had never seen anything like it.

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:28.976
<i>Each time, they would tell us,
"It's superb. It's very well constructed.</i>

01:10:29.894 --> 01:10:33.522
<i>You've solved the technical problems
of those special effects.</i>

01:10:34.523 --> 01:10:35.858
<i>It's economically reasonable.</i>

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.612
But we don't get your director."

01:10:48.537 --> 01:10:53.584
Hollywood did not visualize
science fiction that way.

01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:56.962
It was in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey...</i>

01:10:57.129 --> 01:10:59.423
or in small B movies.

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:04.470
But a huge movie, that would cost
millions of dollars with all the effects.

01:11:04.637 --> 01:11:06.889
They did not conceive of that.

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.599
Maybe it was a bit long as well.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:13.437
Maybe the film was a bit too long.

01:11:14.438 --> 01:11:20.903
They asked me to make a picture
one hour and a half, for the theaters.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:24.740
And myself, "No, why the time?"
I will make a picture...

01:11:24.907 --> 01:11:28.619
of 12 hours! Or 20 hours!

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.897
The totally outrageous side of Jodorowsky...

01:11:57.064 --> 01:12:01.610
especially after
<i>The Holy Mountain</i> and <i>El Topo...</i>

01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:05.406
did not give them faith that he could lead 
this very ambitious project.

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:09.702
Because $15 million in the middle of the '70s 
was a lot of money.

01:12:10.369 --> 01:12:13.580
And that was their answer, even though 
they found everything else to be perfect.

01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:15.791
Everything was great, except the director.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:18.460
You have to be like a poet.

01:12:18.627 --> 01:12:22.214
Your movie must be just as you think of it 
and just as you want it.

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:27.302
Do not take comments to change this or that 
from this person or the other. No!

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.849
The movie has to be just like I dream it.

01:12:32.016 --> 01:12:37.563
The picture need to be exactly
as I am dreaming the picture.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:40.733
Is a dream. Don't change my dream.

01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:02.755
This system make of us slaves.

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:06.425
Without dignity. Without depth.

01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:12.014
With a devil in our pocket.

01:13:13.182 --> 01:13:16.518
This incredible money are in the pocket.

01:13:16.685 --> 01:13:20.230
This money. This shit.

01:13:21.065 --> 01:13:25.235
This nothing.
This paper who have nothing inside.

01:13:27.362 --> 01:13:29.656
Movies have heart.

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:33.660
Have mind.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.955
Have power.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:39.708
Have ambition.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:43.087
I wanted to do something like that.
Why not?

01:14:53.282 --> 01:14:57.452
Very disappointed. Very disappointed
because we all believed in it.

01:14:57.619 --> 01:14:59.746
I believed in it.

01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:09.506
Now, this is my take on it...

01:15:09.673 --> 01:15:11.925
but I think he didn't feel like...

01:15:12.092 --> 01:15:16.930
doing something else after such a project...

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:20.267
which was the project of his life, I believe. 
That's my feeling.

01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:22.728
I think that the humiliation...

01:15:22.895 --> 01:15:25.981
that Alejandro Jodorowsky suffered,
in not having been chosen...

01:15:26.148 --> 01:15:30.986
in having been eliminated for being too original, 
being too surrealistic...

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.696
<i>that is a permanent injury.</i>

01:15:32.863 --> 01:15:35.824
<i>I think that Jodorowsky carries that 
in his heart for life.</i>

01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:45.083
<i>I was convinced that it would be
something great.</i>

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:50.422
But then Dino De Laurentiis' daughter...

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:54.593
came along and took the project
away from us...

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.471
and gave it to David Lynch.

01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:17.866
And when I heard that David Lynch
will direct that...

01:16:18.033 --> 01:16:22.454
I have a pain because I admire David Lynch. 
He can do it!

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:26.959
He is the only one in this moment
who can do it that and he will do it!

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:33.048
I suffer because was my dream.
Another person will do that...

01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:35.634
maybe better than me.

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:39.930
And then when the picture,
they will show the picture here...

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:44.226
I say I will not go to see that
because I will die.

01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:50.107
And my sons say, "No, we are warriors.
You need to come and to see that."

01:16:51.108 --> 01:16:55.696
And then they take me,
like an ill person I came to the theater.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:17:01.493
Even I think I will cry.
And I start to see the picture...

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.289
and step by step, step by step,
step by step...

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:08.917
I became happy because the picture was awful!

01:17:17.551 --> 01:17:18.969
Is a failure!

01:17:20.304 --> 01:17:23.223
Well, it's a human reaction, no?

01:17:24.516 --> 01:17:27.644
Is not beautiful, but I have that reaction.

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:33.859
I say, "Is not possible. Is not David Lynch
because he is a big artist."

01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:36.153
Is the producer who did that.

01:17:36.737 --> 01:17:39.823
I've never seen the movie and I never will.

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:31.083
From this supposed failure,
come a lot of creation.

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:37.381
In the life, thing come, you say "yes."

01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:40.175
Thing go away, you say "yes."

01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:42.135
We don't do <i>Dune?</i> Yes!

01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:45.180
That is, yes, we don't do it!

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:46.932
And then so what?

01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:49.476
And then so what?

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:55.649
<i>Dune</i> is in the world like a dream,
but dreams change the world also.

01:19:09.871 --> 01:19:11.123
I think it was a guide.

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:12.374
A guide for some.

01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:17.212
In any case, I am convinced
that our storyboard...

01:19:17.379 --> 01:19:19.047
made the rounds in the halls of Hollywood.

01:19:19.214 --> 01:19:22.592
I can't imagine that isn't the case.
It pleases me to imagine that.

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.177
You always have to see the positive.

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:23.189
Giger. He make the monster of <i>Alien.</i>

01:22:26.735 --> 01:22:29.362
Why he make the monster of <i>Alien?</i>

01:22:29.529 --> 01:22:31.072
Because Dan O'Bannon.

01:22:32.657 --> 01:22:34.367
<i>O'Bannon create</i> Alien.

01:22:38.246 --> 01:22:42.500
<i>They take Moebius, they take Giger, Foss.</i>

01:22:48.089 --> 01:22:52.177
And Hollywood start to use my group.

01:22:53.887 --> 01:22:55.263
Was very fantastic.

01:23:48.274 --> 01:23:51.403
And then Moebius say to me,
"What you will do? You will die?"

01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:54.739
No, I will not die.

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:58.201
For me to fail is only to change the way.

01:23:59.119 --> 01:24:00.495
If we don't do that...

01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:04.124
the <i>Dune</i> we was doing is...

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:10.130
The roots are the <i>Dune</i> of Herbert.
But this <i>Dune</i> is us.

01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:13.675
Is the optical. Is a creation.

01:24:14.134 --> 01:24:18.722
And then, I will use everything
I put in <i>Dune</i> to make comics.

01:24:19.264 --> 01:24:21.224
I say to Moebius,
"Why we don't do a comic?"

01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:23.351
And I start to dictate <i>The Incal.</i>

01:24:24.352 --> 01:24:27.981
A lot of images that are in here
are in here.

01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:56.301
And then I find an Argentine,
a Spanish, Juan Gimenez.

01:24:56.468 --> 01:25:01.890
<i>And there I make all the spaceship I design 
for</i> Dune <i>are in</i> The Metabarons.

01:25:02.682 --> 01:25:07.312
<i>Even the Duke Leto.
I made him castrated by a bull...</i>

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:11.983
<i>and we find the sorcerer
who will take a drop of his blood...</i>

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.568
<i>in order to make the child.</i>

01:25:13.735 --> 01:25:18.281
<i>I did it here, is here, like I was shooting!
I did it.</i>

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:23.745
<i>I start with</i> Dune, 
<i>but I go farther, no? Farther.</i>

01:25:24.287 --> 01:25:28.249
I continue and I did it, my work.

01:25:33.463 --> 01:25:39.093
I think <i>Dune</i> will be fantastic
if somebody take this script...

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.262
even if I am not alive...

01:25:41.429 --> 01:25:44.390
and do a picture in animation.

01:25:44.933 --> 01:25:46.810
Now is possible.

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:49.395
<i>I can die, they can do my picture.</i>

01:25:51.606 --> 01:25:55.276
I have 84 years, but I am still creating.

01:25:55.443 --> 01:25:56.611
I am not...

01:25:58.071 --> 01:26:02.992
All my life I create,
and is more and more and more.

01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:05.119
The mind is like a universe.

01:26:06.287 --> 01:26:08.998
It's constantly expanding.

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:12.919
Like the universe,
exactly like the universe, open the mind.

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:17.340
<i>The opening of the mind 
is every day, is open.</i>

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:24.055
<i>That was this picture. Open the mind
of all the persons who worked there.</i>

01:26:24.681 --> 01:26:28.142
<i>From the producer to the artists.
From the workers...</i>

01:26:28.309 --> 01:26:33.398
<i>for every one was an opening 
of the mind, this work.</i>

01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:38.778
<i>Was ambitious, but not too. Was ambitious.</i>

01:26:38.945 --> 01:26:41.948
<i>Myself, I have the ambition
to live 300 years.</i>

01:26:42.824 --> 01:26:47.078
<i>I will not live 300 years.
Maybe I will live one year more.</i>

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:48.830
<i>But I have the ambition.</i>

01:26:49.372 --> 01:26:52.125
<i>Why you will not have ambition?</i>

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:54.335
<i>Why?</i>

01:26:55.712 --> 01:26:59.048
<i>Have the greatest ambition possible.</i>

01:26:59.507 --> 01:27:02.260
<i>You want to be immortal?
Fight to be immortal.</i>

01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.179
<i>Do it.</i>

01:27:05.513 --> 01:27:10.518
<i>You want to make
the most fantastic art of movie? Try.</i>

01:27:12.061 --> 01:27:14.564
<i>If you fail, is not important.</i>

01:27:16.065 --> 01:27:17.358
<i>We need to try.</i>
