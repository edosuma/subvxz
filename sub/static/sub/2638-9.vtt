WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:02.380
Penny, hello.

00:03.190 --> 00:03.940
Hey, sheldon.

00:04.270 --> 00:05.700
What is shaking?

00:08.580 --> 00:10.040
I'm sorry?

00:10.040 --> 00:13.610
It's colloquial, a conversation opener.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.090
So, do you find the weather satisfying?

00:16.710 --> 00:18.220
Are you currently sharing in the triumph

00:18.220 --> 00:19.730
of some local sports team?

00:21.410 --> 00:23.360
What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.720
I'm striking up a casual conversation with you.

00:27.470 --> 00:28.280
S'up?

00:33.810 --> 00:35.030
Please don't do that.

00:36.070 --> 00:36.420
All right,

00:36.420 --> 00:37.741
But I'm given to understand that

00:37.741 --> 00:39.063
when you have something awkward to discuss with someone,

00:39.063 --> 00:42.140
it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.240
So, this wasn't the awkward part?

00:48.350 --> 00:49.700
No.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.420
Oh, all right.

00:55.030 --> 00:55.970
S'up?

00:58.260 --> 00:59.760
Oh, good, I used that right.

01:01.100 --> 01:01.414
Anyway,

01:01.414 --> 01:03.977
You're aware that leonard has entered into a new

01:03.977 --> 01:07.020
Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?

01:10.760 --> 01:12.540
Okay, feeling the awkward now.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.107
Her name is

01:15.107 --> 01:16.962
dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly

01:16.962 --> 01:19.670
Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.090
Yeah, leonard told me. good.

01:21.090 --> 01:22.880
What he may have left out is

01:22.880 --> 01:24.670
how important this relationship is to me.

01:26.990 --> 01:28.230
To you?

01:28.230 --> 01:31.257
Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with,

01:31.257 --> 01:33.650
She's the only one I have ever found tolerable.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.790
Well, what about me?

01:41.890 --> 01:43.670
The statement stands for itself.

01:46.450 --> 01:47.470
Well, aren't you sweet?

01:47.750 --> 01:50.276
Anyway, should you have any interaction with her,

01:50.276 --> 01:53.750
It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.830
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.801
You say that now, but consider the following senario

02:00.801 --> 02:02.963
you're sitting in your apartment,

02:02.963 --> 02:04.640
It's late, you're alone.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.294
Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and

02:08.294 --> 02:10.312
Progesterone and suddenly even

02:10.312 --> 02:13.410
Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.160
Or a, uh, "hookup"

02:17.160 --> 02:19.170
As it's referred to by today's urban youth.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.370
Really? yes.

02:21.370 --> 02:22.565
Now, should that happen,

02:22.565 --> 02:25.630
I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.920
I could think about you.

02:34.290 --> 02:35.810
Fine, whatever works.

02:38.030 --> 02:39.550
Always nice talking to you, sheldon.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.510
Uh, peace out!

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.350 --> 03:19.570
Well, this is very pleasant.

03:21.190 --> 03:23.300
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.050
And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.

03:27.190 --> 03:28.800
I stand corrected.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.640
You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.647
A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is

03:34.647 --> 03:38.420
Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.

03:39.860 --> 03:41.000
That's very interesting.

03:41.000 --> 03:41.670
Thank you.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.590
She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice.

03:45.990 --> 03:46.839
Well, stephanie,

03:46.839 --> 03:50.188
Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,

03:50.188 --> 03:52.440
I guess I'll just have to pick it up.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.420
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

04:05.450 --> 04:07.140
No. good.

04:07.140 --> 04:08.850
What's your favorite fruit?

04:08.850 --> 04:11.620
Uh, strawberries.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.750
Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.120
Where did you do your medical internship?

04:18.120 --> 04:20.440
Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.650
Really? that's where I was born!

04:25.190 --> 04:26.420
You're kidding!

04:26.420 --> 04:28.990
I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital.

04:28.990 --> 04:32.150
When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.

04:33.330 --> 04:34.590
Why, w-w-what happened?

04:34.590 --> 04:35.800
Radiation burns.

04:36.740 --> 04:39.430
A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.

04:40.450 --> 04:43.260
I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?

04:43.260 --> 04:44.930
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.190
In fact, I was briefly able to see

04:47.190 --> 04:48.631
the inside of my sister's guinea pig,

04:48.631 --> 04:50.010
Snowball, before he caught fire.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.305
It led to an interesting

04:54.305 --> 04:56.450
"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner."

04:58.930 --> 05:00.200
Uh, sheldon?

05:01.660 --> 05:02.800
Excuse me.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.290
When I come back,just for fun,

05:05.290 --> 05:07.030
the subject will be alternative history.

05:07.030 --> 05:07.638
Specifically,

05:07.638 --> 05:09.965
How would the civil war have gone differently

05:09.965 --> 05:12.550
If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?

05:17.860 --> 05:19.740
Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

05:20.970 --> 05:24.210
Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?

05:24.210 --> 05:24.459
I do.

05:24.459 --> 05:26.664
Do you? because frankly,

05:26.664 --> 05:28.870
you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.360
Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down?

05:37.470 --> 05:38.630
To help.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.759
Look, if you fail at this relationship,

05:40.759 --> 05:42.888
and history suggests you will,

05:42.888 --> 05:45.354
Then we risk losing the medical officer

05:45.354 --> 05:48.010
That our landing party has always needed.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.340
What landing party?

05:54.650 --> 05:56.727
You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty,

05:56.727 --> 05:59.250
Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed...

06:02.060 --> 06:04.020
And now we've got mccoy.

06:12.150 --> 06:12.255
So,

06:12.255 --> 06:14.117
We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray

06:14.117 --> 06:15.980
and there it is,

06:15.980 --> 06:18.640
Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...

06:19.090 --> 06:20.540
One of my earrings.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.540
Oh, my god, what did you do?

06:24.540 --> 06:26.640
What do you think I did?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.456
I discreetly slipped off the other earring,

06:28.456 --> 06:30.920
Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!

06:32.540 --> 06:34.870
I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

06:36.670 --> 06:37.470
Hi, sheldon.

06:37.470 --> 06:38.134
Hi, stephanie.

06:38.134 --> 06:39.077
I'm sorry I'm late,

06:39.077 --> 06:42.170
But yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation.

06:43.310 --> 06:44.790
What invitation?

06:46.260 --> 06:48.150
"we're going to the movies."

06:48.610 --> 06:50.970
What movie? what theater? what time?

06:52.970 --> 06:55.101
If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you,

06:55.101 --> 06:56.600
You couldn't have done a better job.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.730
Oh, clearly I could have.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.915
It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser

07:02.915 --> 07:05.470
History on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.480
Wait here, I'll find us seats.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.800
Uh, no, we have seats.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.360
Not the right seats.

07:22.450 --> 07:23.620
What is he doing?

07:23.620 --> 07:26.240
He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.950
Does he always do this?

07:31.950 --> 07:34.960
Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone.

07:42.150 --> 07:44.440
I am really sorry about this.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.940
No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.070
My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.380
Leonard, you want to slide over one?

07:59.380 --> 08:01.600
No, just sit here.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.570
Oh, yeah, this is it.

08:21.530 --> 08:22.580
Leonard.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.120
Leonard? leonard?!

08:25.830 --> 08:26.810
What, sheldon?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.880
What, sheldon?! what, sheldon?!

08:30.120 --> 08:31.510
Tell me what you see here.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.669
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.799
This is stephanie's facebook page.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.940
Now, where it should say "in a relationship," what does it say?

08:40.940 --> 08:42.760
"stephanie barnett is single."

08:42.760 --> 08:44.693
Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening,

08:44.693 --> 08:47.220
She threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.160
Who's mike?!

08:51.160 --> 08:52.930
Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?

08:54.570 --> 08:57.500
It's just her facebook page and we've

08:57.500 --> 08:58.480
Only been going out a couple of weeks.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.540
You don't see it, do you?

08:59.540 --> 09:00.880
We're losing her.

09:03.990 --> 09:06.520
Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you.

09:06.860 --> 09:10.280
You are not in this relationship.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.020
I am.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.435
Ergo, you have no say in anything

09:16.435 --> 09:19.850
that happens between me and stephanie.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.240
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.077
Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a,

09:27.077 --> 09:30.420
You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.250
General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.850
Give me one good reason why not.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.530
Because this is not startrek

09:47.330 --> 09:48.220
Penny?

09:48.220 --> 09:50.860
Penny? penny?!

09:52.210 --> 09:52.950
What?

09:53.650 --> 09:55.140
This is banana bread.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.250
This is a door knob.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.836
It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can

10:04.836 --> 10:08.460
Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.920
Sheldon, would you like to come in?

10:13.290 --> 10:15.040
I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.120
Were you robbed?

10:22.570 --> 10:24.570
No.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.950
How can you be sure?

10:27.930 --> 10:29.430
Sheldon, what do you want?

10:29.430 --> 10:32.034
I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you,

10:32.034 --> 10:34.800
But leonard is failing in yet another relationship.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.520
He's having problems with stephanie?

10:36.540 --> 10:39.980
She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.650
If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data.

10:43.650 --> 10:44.255
Specifically,

10:44.255 --> 10:46.521
I need to know exactly what leonard did that

10:46.521 --> 10:49.200
Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.

10:51.010 --> 10:53.030
What?

10:53.390 --> 10:54.790
Again, urban slang.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.570
In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.260
So, what is the "down" and the "low"?

11:01.260 --> 11:03.482
And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so,

11:03.482 --> 11:04.861
You feel free to include

11:04.861 --> 11:06.240
any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

11:08.390 --> 11:09.920
We never got to the bedroom.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.700
Because?

11:14.550 --> 11:16.750
Oh, okay, all right, you know what?

11:17.270 --> 11:18.420
I'll tell you what happened.

11:20.170 --> 11:22.636
We were young, we were very much in love,

11:22.636 --> 11:25.100
But we could only communicate through a

11:25.100 --> 11:27.690
Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.583
It's not enough that you made me watch that movie,

11:34.583 --> 11:35.810
But now you mock me with it?

11:39.970 --> 11:44.500
Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.

11:50.350 --> 11:52.800
You told me you were going to have the talk with him.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.310
I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.

11:57.610 --> 11:58.399
More to the point,

11:58.399 --> 12:01.460
It's about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.730
Oh, I don't think you can.

12:02.730 --> 12:03.960
Well, why not?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.350
Look at leonard's record.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.240
27 days with joyce kim.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.250
During which she defected to north korea.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.260
Two booty calls with leslie winkle.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.820
For which she awarded him the nickname "speed of light leonard."

12:17.430 --> 12:19.470
And the three hour dinner with penny.

12:19.470 --> 12:20.733
Which would have been two and a half if

12:20.733 --> 12:22.190
They ordered the souffle when they sat down.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.415
Based on the geometric progression,

12:25.415 --> 12:26.942
His relationship with stephanie

12:26.942 --> 12:28.470
should have ended after 20 minutes.

12:29.210 --> 12:30.560
Yes, I'm aware of the math.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.930
Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

12:32.930 --> 12:34.590
The issue remains.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.190
How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?

12:38.590 --> 12:40.927
Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.740
Your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.270
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

12:47.270 --> 12:49.085
Don't shpritz him with that body spray from the

12:49.085 --> 12:51.210
Commercial where the women undress when they smell it.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.230
That doesn't work at all.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.220
No matter how much you put on.

13:00.060 --> 13:00.860
So, that's all you've got?

13:00.860 --> 13:03.520
Apocalyptic genocide and "go easy on the cologne"?

13:06.140 --> 13:07.310
Yeah. yes.

13:10.370 --> 13:11.090
Penny.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.740
Penny?

13:13.330 --> 13:14.230
What?

13:18.940 --> 13:20.670
Penny?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.720
Zucchini bread.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.200
Oh, thank you.

13:30.200 --> 13:30.910
May I come in?

13:30.910 --> 13:31.320
No.

13:33.040 --> 13:33.560
I see.

13:34.160 --> 13:34.612
Apparently,

13:34.612 --> 13:36.261
My earlier inquiry regarding

13:36.261 --> 13:37.910
you and leonard crossed some sort of line.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.130
I apologize.

13:41.060 --> 13:42.190
Well, thank you.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.590
So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?

13:44.590 --> 13:46.030
Yes. great.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.030
New topic.

13:47.030 --> 13:50.040
Where are you in your menstrual cycle?

13:53.390 --> 13:54.260
What?!

13:54.260 --> 13:56.290
I've been doing some research online,

13:56.290 --> 13:58.321
and apparently female primates,

13:58.321 --> 14:00.650
You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

14:02.350 --> 14:03.898
They find their mate more desirable

14:03.898 --> 14:05.800
When he's being courted by another female.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.469
Now, This effect is intensified when the rival female

14:08.469 --> 14:11.350
Is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.880
Which brings me back to my question.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.540
Where are you in your--

14:16.880 --> 14:19.840
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.396
All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,

14:25.396 --> 14:28.220
Why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?

14:31.050 --> 14:32.920
Leonard, you're going to have to let this go.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.890
You had a little cheese dip, you farted.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.170
I thought it was cute.

14:38.950 --> 14:40.280
Oh, hi, stephanie.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.160
Wanna more wine?

14:43.360 --> 14:46.940
Yeah, I'm not driving anywhere tonight.

14:59.370 --> 15:00.590
What are you doing?

15:00.590 --> 15:02.711
I have a craving for white asparagus

15:02.711 --> 15:05.480
That apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

15:11.230 --> 15:12.050
Excuse me.

15:15.210 --> 15:16.460
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:16.460 --> 15:17.680
I'm helping you with stephanie.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.750
By making constipated moose sounds?

15:21.450 --> 15:23.580
When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,

15:23.580 --> 15:25.710
It will establish you as the "alpha" male.

15:25.710 --> 15:26.450
You see...

15:26.810 --> 15:29.791
When a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination,

15:29.791 --> 15:31.580
She produces the hormone oxytocin.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.631
If the two of you then engage in intercourse,

15:33.631 --> 15:36.194
This will create the biochemical reaction in the brain

15:36.200 --> 15:38.900
Which lay people naively interpret as "falling in love."

15:44.150 --> 15:46.140
Would it work if I just punched you in the face?

15:48.300 --> 15:50.180
Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.110
I'm not strong enough, leonard, you'll have to do it.

15:56.230 --> 15:57.750
Oh, for god's sakes.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.130
Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

16:13.770 --> 16:14.960
Do you want some help with that?

16:14.960 --> 16:18.890
No, no, no, I got it.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.380
No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.208
This is something I long ago came to

16:23.208 --> 16:25.240
Peace with in my role as the beta male.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.240
Open it.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.900
- Oh, my god, are you okay? - no, I'm not.

16:38.900 --> 16:39.840
I'm bleeding.

16:39.850 --> 16:41.260
Like a gladiator!

16:42.500 --> 16:44.420
Oh, honey, you're going to need stitches.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.120
Stitches? with a needle?

16:46.790 --> 16:48.470
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.010
Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.

17:02.570 --> 17:05.220
Fyi, I was defrosting a steak in there.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.859
What a beautiful job stephanie did.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.055
I might have gone with a mattress suture

17:14.055 --> 17:15.371
instead of a blanket stitch,

17:15.371 --> 17:16.880
But you can't argue with her results.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.440
It's a shame it won't scar.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.770
The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.950
I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.216
Just for the record,

17:30.216 --> 17:32.209
My efforts to establish you as the alpha

17:32.209 --> 17:34.600
Male were not aided by you bursting into tears.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.970
I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.

17:37.970 --> 17:39.080
Watery?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.180
She stuck a needle into my hand!

17:43.560 --> 17:45.600
Hey, how's my big cry baby?

17:47.420 --> 17:48.470
I didn't cry.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.300
Okay, I'm just teasing you.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.900
But, yeah, you did.

17:54.260 --> 17:54.920
Okay, it's all good.

17:54.930 --> 17:56.830
What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?

17:56.830 --> 17:58.870
Oh, are you still going to spend the night?

17:59.230 --> 18:01.880
Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.615
She's right. as long as you're vomiting,

18:03.615 --> 18:05.350
coitus is contra-indicated.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.090
Thank you, dr. cooper.

18:09.090 --> 18:11.510
You're welcome, dr. hofstadter.

18:14.710 --> 18:17.000
Okay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.530
What?

18:21.530 --> 18:24.260
Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.350
I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.860
Hey, can you open this for me?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.140
Can I see your stitches?

18:38.140 --> 18:38.650
Sure.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.735
Answering the question once and for all

18:46.735 --> 18:48.560
Why wolowitz bailed out of medical school.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.840
Leonard, congratulations.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.690
What for?

18:52.690 --> 18:54.670
Your facebook status update.

18:54.670 --> 18:57.920
Leonard hofstadter is "in a relationship."

18:57.920 --> 19:00.150
What? no. no, that's not right.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.930
Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did?

19:05.420 --> 19:08.240
Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.

19:09.630 --> 19:10.440
Seriously?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.070
You went first, after only two weeks?

19:12.070 --> 19:14.270
That's bold...

19:14.590 --> 19:16.450
It's not bold, it's a mistake.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.260
I didn't change my status.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.750
Well, then who did?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.290
I had no choice. he cried in front of her.

19:29.150 --> 19:31.590
You hacked my facebook account?

19:31.590 --> 19:33.625
Oh, it's hardly hacking

19:33.625 --> 19:35.661
when you use the same password for everything,

19:35.661 --> 19:36.310
"kal-el."

19:37.740 --> 19:39.110
Are you insane?

19:39.110 --> 19:41.050
Now she's going to think I'm desperate.

19:41.050 --> 19:43.390
You've destroyed this relationship!

19:43.390 --> 19:45.330
And you want to know what the worst part is?

19:45.330 --> 19:48.081
You don't even understand what you did wrong because you

19:48.081 --> 19:50.980
Can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!

19:52.040 --> 19:53.010
In which I am not an expert.

19:53.010 --> 19:53.990
Don't even!

19:57.960 --> 19:59.840
I don't want to hear another word out of you.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.830
What's wrong, lassie? timmy fall down the well?

20:11.170 --> 20:13.320
She just updated her facebook status.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.800
"stephanie barnett is in a relationship

20:15.800 --> 20:17.790
with leonard hofstadter."

20:19.170 --> 20:20.230
Really?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.150
Oh, look at that.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.820
I have a girlfriend.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.435
If I am permitted to speak again,

20:29.435 --> 20:31.680
dr. sheldon cooper for the win.
