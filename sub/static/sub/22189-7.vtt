01:55.040 --> 01:56.240
Hi.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.680
THE DAY BEFORE

02:25.200 --> 02:26.960
Who knew he was gonna jump?

02:27.840 --> 02:29.400
All thanks to you guys, great job!

02:29.480 --> 02:32.560
-It's no time for lectures.
-Yeah, that's right.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.120
Well, we've got nothing more
to say to one another.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.040
-Take me home.
-The fuck you going? Come here.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.480
What do you want?

02:40.680 --> 02:42.560
Don't you see it's over?

02:42.640 --> 02:45.400
Theodosiou is dead
and you guys killed him.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.680
It might be normal for you,
but it's not for me.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.960
Now we have a problem,
and you gotta solve it.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.560
Sure, how?

02:51.640 --> 02:52.960
How the fuck do I know?

02:53.040 --> 02:56.080
You're the one with friends
in the Vatican, make something up.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.000
I'm not making up a damn thing.
We're going our separate ways.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.680
This isn't like a party
that you can leave when you want.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.800
Fix this,
or you'll end up like the priest.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.840
-Let's go.
-Go.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.760
Let's go too.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.480
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:23.760 --> 03:26.400
And it's not over yet,
they want to keep going!

03:26.480 --> 03:30.400
-How do I fit in with them, tell me?
-So, you're the clean one?

03:31.120 --> 03:33.840
Weren't you the one who organized
the orgies for the priest,

03:33.920 --> 03:36.360
wheeling and dealing for the Vatican land?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.720
What they want, we all want

03:38.800 --> 03:41.000
and so it's only right we stick together.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.960
That's how you fit in.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.440
Would you really have stopped today?

03:51.720 --> 03:53.760
Or maybe you would have gone on your own?

03:57.680 --> 03:59.400
Maybe you would've screwed them.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.440
Isn't that right?

04:02.560 --> 04:06.640
We're all in this together now,
and I'm the only one who can protect you.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.080
The only one who cares about you.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
Okay.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.160
Take me to the penthouse.
I can't show up at home at this hour.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.440
I'll call you.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.040
Get off!

05:32.920 --> 05:34.440
Don't you like me, Spadino?

05:35.200 --> 05:38.320
You can tell me, I won't be offended,
lots of guys like me.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.160
If you don't play your part with me,
at least do it with the family.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.840
I know what I gotta do in the family.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.640
Doesn't look like it,
they talk about you behind your back

05:54.720 --> 05:57.160
and I don't want to find out
I married a puppet.

05:57.360 --> 06:01.200
You married a man you gotta respect,
is that clear?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.160
Now go to sleep!

06:28.160 --> 06:29.240
Hi.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.160
Good, glad you're here.
You can take your stuff away.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.760
You kicking me out?

06:41.840 --> 06:45.560
You can't just come and go
whenever you want.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.360
Actually, I came to talk.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.440
Talk about what?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.520
Some things take time,

06:57.480 --> 06:59.240
and I don't have time for this now.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.920
Then go think somewhere else.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.840
Okay, bye.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.880
Is that client still in Rome?

07:37.080 --> 07:38.920
Okay, send me the address.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.640
Had Theodosiou spoken
to the members of the Commission?

08:04.720 --> 08:06.280
Can we count on everyone's vote?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.800
After what happened,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.080
we can't proceed with the vote.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.360
All eyes are on what happened.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.120
The circumstances of
the monsignor's death are still unclear.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.360
He was at the center of many interests.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.360
The media talks about his work
on this Commission, too.

08:42.559 --> 08:43.760
Forgive me, Monsignor,

08:43.840 --> 08:47.920
we're very aggrieved and confused
by what has happened.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.800
We had great respect
for Monsignor Theodosiou,

08:52.200 --> 08:53.600
and I am certain

08:53.800 --> 08:56.640
that he can't have done anything
to embarrass the Church.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.320
Until we are certain,

08:58.400 --> 09:01.400
this Commission is to refrain
from making any decisions.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.960
I understand your thoughtfulness,

09:04.480 --> 09:08.240
but our duty is to cover the debt.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.520
It's only a few days
until the mayor steps down.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.800
We don't know
what's going to happen after that.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.800
I think it's risky to postpone the vote.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.200
Your Eminence,
it is my duty to protect the Church.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.640
This commission will not vote today.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.560
If there's nothing else,
we can adjourn the meeting.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.440
You, take two guys
and go to the Eur Café.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.840
I want the Adamis to think we're serious.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.240
I'll start them dealing.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.160
Go for it, it's our turf now.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.160
Go.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.280
Have you seen Mario and Angelo?

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
May I?

10:22.120 --> 10:25.560
You’ve got a personal score
to settle with Forsini, right?

10:26.760 --> 10:27.720
So?

10:28.520 --> 10:29.440
What about it?

10:29.520 --> 10:31.800
Maybe he banged your wife
while you were married.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.320
Maybe you want to get even.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.560
Maybe you're doing this for yourself.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.480
Maybe I'll pull the plug
and you can play by yourself.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.880
Here, see if this jogs his memory.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.800
They're testing us, gypsy scum.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.600
So why didn't they target one
of our main clubs in Ostia?

11:17.800 --> 11:20.200
Because they know compared to us,
they're nothing.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.840
But meanwhile, they made a small move.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.440
Now that my father's gone,
they wanna see what I'm capable of.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.520
Pieces of shit!

11:29.600 --> 11:32.320
I need to know what's going on in Eur,
go take a look.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.120
Hi, Romolo.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.360
Livia, come, we need to talk.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.160
You were only able
to slow down the voting process.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.800
I had no other option.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.480
But the next time,
they have to vote for you.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.800
When will the Commission meet next?

11:56.200 --> 11:58.400
That's the point, I don't know.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.800
They're scared something bad
will come out about Theodosiou,

12:03.880 --> 12:06.520
and the Church will get caught up
in the scandal, too.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.880
Then fix it so there is no scandal.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.560
They'll vote,
and they'll be grateful to you.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.240
Can you help me?

12:18.280 --> 12:22.360
I can try to find out the name
of the doctor doing the autopsy,

12:23.120 --> 12:24.640
but you've got to do the rest.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.400
How?

12:28.280 --> 12:32.000
Sara, you're in business with criminals.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.480
You're more expert than me
about certain things.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.560
Well?

12:44.840 --> 12:46.880
What do you want to do about the gypsies?

12:47.680 --> 12:48.840
I gotta think about it.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.960
Meanwhile, they snuck into your house.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.360
It's not like that.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.440
Forget it.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.440
Anyway, it's none of my business.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.200
-No?
-No, you're the one in charge.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.680
-Now let's see how it ends up.
-There.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.240
Good idea.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.840
Show everyone we're divided.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.680
Why do you think Manfredi came after us?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.840
Because there's a woman
in charge in Ostia.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.280
A woman whose father they killed
and she did fuck all.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.920
Why are you here?

13:28.840 --> 13:32.640
To tell you you can't give Samurai
our land in Ostia without me.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.240
And that I'm taking Mom's house.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.320
-Stefano.
-What the fuck you want now?

15:27.400 --> 15:30.520
You were supposed to give me an answer,
and you didn't.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.840
Leave me the fuck alone, Amedeo.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.600
What is it?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.120
You're a quick learner, I see.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.360
Does Gabriella know?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.320
That you're a corrupt asshole?

16:03.400 --> 16:04.960
I think she does.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.240
Shall we get a coffee,

16:10.320 --> 16:14.000
or talk about our friend Taccon's
appointment for the museums of Rome?

16:17.160 --> 16:18.440
EDILCIGNO GROUP SRL

16:18.520 --> 16:20.240
-Good morning, madam.
-Hi, Anna.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.680
You want to blackmail
the Vatican Commission?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.160
They don't want what happened
to Theodosiou to be tied to the Church

16:36.240 --> 16:39.880
and I'm going to help them, but they've
got to give me something in exchange.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.000
They've ruled the world for centuries,
and you try to con them?

16:43.080 --> 16:44.440
I was advised.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.000
By whom?

16:47.560 --> 16:50.000
You went to the Countess
before you came to me?

16:51.840 --> 16:53.800
Sara, don't get me in trouble.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.960
I work with priests. My family has served
the Vatican for centuries.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.200
You've always left the dirty work to me,

16:59.280 --> 17:01.600
but we've shared the benefits, too easy.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.000
This time we're in with criminals,
someone died yesterday.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.200
All right, we'll stop here.

17:11.839 --> 17:12.720
I'll stop.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.520
You decide what to do.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.640
All right, we'll do what you say.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.720
But be careful.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.480
I'm not risking my life for you.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.920
I'm not going down for you.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.280
What else?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.040
You were supposed
to bring the signed papers, Livia.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.640
The gypsies are raising their heads
in my house.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.480
They want to take our place,
and that can't happen.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.640
Forget the gypsies,
they won't do it again.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.040
You just worry about getting me
that land in Ostia, nothing else.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.120
I need more time.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.400
No time left, I've got to close.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.240
I gotta fix a problem with my brother.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.280
Should I step in?

18:20.720 --> 18:23.720
No, I'll take care of Ostia stuff
on my own.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.880
MORGUE

19:00.480 --> 19:01.840
Come in.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.240
Dr. Trieste?
May I have a moment of your time?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.520
Sara Monaschi hasn't done anything
you asked her to,

19:10.600 --> 19:12.760
and she didn't talk to Theodosiou.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.160
-How do you know?
-I asked her.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.040
I asked her

19:18.200 --> 19:21.320
if we had the Commission members' votes.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.280
She didn't even answer.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.640
It's just a few days
until the mayor resigns,

19:26.720 --> 19:28.120
and we haven't closed yet.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.120
When's the next meeting?

19:32.200 --> 19:35.400
As soon as we have a better idea
of how Theodosiou died.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.040
Sara Monaschi's been leading us on
from the start,

19:54.640 --> 19:57.760
she kept the priest to herself
and now she's still in the running.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.000
-Really?
-She works in the Vatican.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.280
She's stronger than us in there.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.880
Want me to take care of it?

20:08.360 --> 20:09.400
I wish.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.760
We can't do it like that.
I have to take care of it myself.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.880
-Are you a relative?
-No.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.000
He was a dear friend.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.880
How can I help you?

20:21.960 --> 20:26.640
Father Theodosiou was complex,
filled with contradictions.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.600
If anything came out about his death

20:32.680 --> 20:34.960
that casts doubt over his integrity,

20:35.880 --> 20:38.560
for example, that he committed suicide...

20:38.640 --> 20:42.880
Well, that's the conclusion
from today's examination.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.440
We're talking about a man
of the Church, doctor.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.840
Perhaps we could do something together,
to make sure he rests in peace,

20:52.200 --> 20:54.760
a gesture of humanity
that preserves his memory.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.520
Something compassionate.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.600
Exactly.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.640
All right, but what are you asking
in concrete terms?

21:02.720 --> 21:06.560
A report that says
Father Theodosiou became ill.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.160
And as a consequence,
he fell out of a window.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.240
A favor that I could repay.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.800
If you have a charity or a foundation,

21:18.000 --> 21:22.080
we could agree on a figure,
I could make a contribution.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.360
Money?

21:25.240 --> 21:26.360
A contribution.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.480
If you were open to it...

21:31.080 --> 21:33.960
So we falsify the report.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.040
And for how much?

21:36.880 --> 21:39.120
Did you have a figure in mind?

21:39.880 --> 21:41.800
We can work that out together.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.720
Sorry, wait a minute.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.320
That wasn't what I had in mind.
I didn't think...

21:50.400 --> 21:54.360
You coming, asking me for a false report
and what did you think?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.720
Don't worry, we won't do it here.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.040
-Checking to see if it's worth it.
-Let go of me.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.680
Let go of me, I said!

22:04.560 --> 22:07.360
The fuck you screaming for?
Nobody can hear you.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.240
What a bitch!

22:32.000 --> 22:33.680
What the fuck happened?

22:33.760 --> 22:36.000
He called me pissed off,
said you disappeared.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.880
-I didn't feel well.
-You don't look like you're dying to me.

22:38.960 --> 22:39.840
Calm down.

22:39.920 --> 22:43.200
You made me look like an asshole.
He's in town every month.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.000
-I'll give the money back.
-Really?

22:45.080 --> 22:46.400
Don't touch me!

22:48.000 --> 22:50.600
-The fuck are you doing?
-How dare you?

22:54.760 --> 22:58.040
Go back to live with monkeys,
you don't belong with normal people.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.920
Sir, there's someone...

23:09.600 --> 23:10.960
Thank you, Anna.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.640
You are...?

23:18.520 --> 23:21.320
A guy your wife thinks she can mess with.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.840
I don't understand.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.360
You gotta stop, for your own good.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.880
Who sent you?

23:34.640 --> 23:35.560
No one.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.760
I did you the honor of coming in person.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.000
You'd better leave.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.520
Tell your wife to do what she promised.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.960
You know who I am, right?

23:54.440 --> 23:56.520
Wipe your face, you're all sweaty.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.600
-Where the fuck's the priest?
-He's here.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.720
He's in there?

24:32.400 --> 24:34.320
Get in!

24:34.400 --> 24:35.840
-Get in!
-No!

24:35.920 --> 24:38.000
Did you hear what he said?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.400
I said get in!

24:41.440 --> 24:43.480
What a pig, get in.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.760
All good, five minutes and he's ready.

25:10.560 --> 25:14.440
Here are the reports,
the old one and the new one.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.480
-He wrote it in a flash.
-He didn't like the company...

25:21.880 --> 25:23.800
Don't look at us, Lele did it all.

25:27.880 --> 25:28.840
Thank you.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.120
Are you all in there?
One last drag and I'll join you.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.440
I chair the commission.
I'm not a guard dog.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.720
Smoke in peace.

25:52.680 --> 25:53.880
I've got it, thanks.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.680
I remember certain meetings years ago...

26:00.040 --> 26:03.120
Those rooms were gas chambers.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.880
Smoking and getting excited about politics
were still permitted pleasures.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.160
You don't get excited
about politics anymore?

26:13.560 --> 26:14.800
I can understand.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.040
You and I were used like spare tires,

26:18.760 --> 26:21.240
kept in the trunk
in the hopes of being needed.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.640
But politics, real politics,
others did that.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.600
But your passion is art and your dream
is running the museums of Rome, right?

26:33.280 --> 26:35.120
You want to make me suffer today?

26:36.600 --> 26:39.160
Wouldn't it be great to live that dream?

26:40.600 --> 26:41.840
The job...

26:44.120 --> 26:45.840
director of the museums of Rome,

26:47.520 --> 26:48.600
is yours.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.600
If you want it.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.520
At this point, we have nothing more
to say to each other, Mr. Cinaglia.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.880
Certain opportunities only happen
once in a lifetime,

27:05.960 --> 27:07.760
it would be a shame to waste them.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.040
Take some time to think it over,

27:14.080 --> 27:15.320
until tonight.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.280
So he killed himself.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.760
How do you have this report?

27:37.720 --> 27:39.280
Because I've got this one too.

27:47.440 --> 27:48.840
What does this mean?

27:48.920 --> 27:52.880
That we can report everything,
let the truth come to light.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.320
The monsignor was a good man,
but also a great sinner.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.480
Suicide...

28:02.080 --> 28:03.560
there'd be an inquest.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.560
The scandal would explode right here,

28:07.640 --> 28:09.280
right next to the Holy Father.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.200
Or we can certify

28:12.280 --> 28:15.120
that Father Theodosiou died
of natural causes.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.120
In exchange for what?

28:17.720 --> 28:21.680
That the Ostia land is sold
to the company that Theodosiou indicated,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.280
my husband's, the Edilcigno Group.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.360
All right.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.160
But there must be no trace of this story.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.680
Obviously.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.040
I'm hearing strange rumors
about Aureliano Adami.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.200
Is it true he wants
to keep some land in Ostia?

29:13.520 --> 29:14.720
I don't know.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.960
I know he wanted to fix up a beach club,
but his father didn't want him to.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.000
Nothing else?

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
No.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.760
You know you have
to tell me everything, right?

29:29.760 --> 29:32.120
The day I start to think
I don't need you anymore--

29:32.200 --> 29:34.840
-That's all I know, I swear.
-Then find out more.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.880
I want to know what's going on
in his head.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.480
Go.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.800
Dad?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.760
Did you make these meatballs?

30:30.600 --> 30:32.000
You've started cooking?

30:43.880 --> 30:44.920
What's wrong?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.120
What were you doing with Samurai?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.240
What, with Samurai?

30:58.040 --> 30:59.680
In the street, two minutes ago.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.720
-You're wrong.
-No.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.680
He was on a scooter.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.360
You're wrong...

31:08.560 --> 31:10.520
Are you done bullshitting me?

31:11.160 --> 31:14.240
That was Samurai,
one of the biggest criminals in Rome

31:14.320 --> 31:16.560
and I'm a cop!

31:17.480 --> 31:21.080
-What were you doing with him?
-Don't you dare touch me again!

31:22.440 --> 31:25.200
-Come with me, then.
-What the fuck are you doing?

31:25.280 --> 31:27.280
What I should have done a long time ago.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.760
Get out.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.520
They're meeting to vote tonight.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.520
Samurai came to see me,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.360
he says you have to do everything
he asked you.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.120
Did he threaten you?

32:09.760 --> 32:11.160
What do you think?

32:13.520 --> 32:17.000
-Who are you bringing into my life?
-I didn't bring him.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.960
He's desperate.
We're pulling the rug out from under him.

32:23.080 --> 32:26.200
I want to close this deal,
I'm not going to let him threaten me.

32:26.840 --> 32:30.080
I just convinced the Commission
to choose our company.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.440
Tonight we'll get the land.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.960
Fuck, Sara!

32:36.120 --> 32:38.920
If you still count for anything,
you owe it all to me.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.040
He's a killer.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.960
I know, but he won't kill anyone.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.840
You don't do business that way,
even he knows that.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.280
I have to go back to the office.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.960
Who is it?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.920
It's me. I wanna make up.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.800
What happened?

34:06.960 --> 34:08.120
Who was it?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.719
Did he kick you out?

34:17.400 --> 34:18.360
Yes.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.480
Come on, it's nothing,
just a father-son fight.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.760
No, it's not fucking nothing.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.520
Did he find out what you're doing?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.159
No, he doesn't know anything.

34:31.159 --> 34:32.800
So, what happened?

34:35.600 --> 34:37.679
Drop it, I don't want to talk about it.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.160
Why did you call
if you don't want to talk?

34:44.560 --> 34:46.199
Because I needed to be with you.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.639
And I need somewhere to go.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.000
You did something nice for me today.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.000
Thanks.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.280
Where do you go every day
instead of working?

35:17.640 --> 35:20.440
Spadino, I'm preparing you
to become a boss,

35:20.960 --> 35:24.120
but the men always see you do fuck all.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.000
You know what they'll say? "Spadino who?"

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
"Who's Spadino?"

35:32.760 --> 35:36.440
We're growing, the Sales are important.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.480
The wedding was the first thing
we did together,

35:39.560 --> 35:41.840
and you started off on the wrong foot.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.120
What will they say about us?

35:45.560 --> 35:48.800
So, will you tell me
where the fuck you go all day?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.320
Hand me that hose.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.040
Hand me that hose!

35:57.720 --> 36:00.600
You won't tell me where you go?

36:00.920 --> 36:04.160
Spadino, I love you,
but don't piss me off.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.920
I'll kill you whenever I like.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.240
All the votes are for the Edilcigno Group,

36:41.320 --> 36:42.680
except for one abstention.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.360
If you'd like to check.

36:55.640 --> 36:59.320
-Did you two fight again?
-Give me that sweatshirt.

37:01.840 --> 37:02.960
Come on.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.120
We gotta make a delivery.
We gotta get the Eur Café moving

37:14.200 --> 37:16.680
or else the Adamis will think
we were just playing.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.720
Will you go?

37:19.840 --> 37:20.800
I didn't hear you.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.360
Yeah, I'll go.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.440
Ordering me around... what the fuck?

37:39.560 --> 37:42.120
-It's because he trusts you.
-Yeah...

38:02.880 --> 38:03.920
Well?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.200
-It went well.
-Well done.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.360
I knew it.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.120
The first time I saw you,
it was like seeing myself.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.040
I knew you'd get me the revenge
I was looking for.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.200
Tell me everything.

38:29.800 --> 38:30.840
Yes?

38:36.880 --> 38:37.800
I see.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.920
Sara Monaschi got the Ostia land,

38:42.000 --> 38:43.520
from the Vatican.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.840
Get up.

40:08.480 --> 40:12.040
-Spadino did what he was supposed to?
-Yeah.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.800
[in Sinti] [Hit him!]

40:16.280 --> 40:17.760
[Kill him!]

40:26.240 --> 40:27.480
Mr. Cinaglia.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.800
Good evening.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.280
I thought about it,

40:33.400 --> 40:34.800
I agree.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.240
Good, Taccon.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.560
You made the right choice.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.760
Give us your approval,

40:43.480 --> 40:47.200
and the museums of Rome are yours.
Good evening.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.800
So, it's done?

42:13.400 --> 42:16.720
-Now what do we gotta do?
-All the bureaucratic paperwork.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.000
The change of title
and all the formalities.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.960
-What the fuck did she say?
-You're in business.

42:24.040 --> 42:27.280
-Fix yourself up, buy a shirt.
-Shut up.

42:30.480 --> 42:33.840
See? It was worth
getting in business with us.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.720
It's not that I had much choice.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.600
It's been a pleasure, I'm going.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.120
What? I thought we'd celebrate together.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.560
No, I'm seeing Isabel.
We'll do it some other time.

42:48.160 --> 42:51.520
-Who, the black chick?
-Yeah, her name's Isabel.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.520
See ya, Spadino.

44:59.720 --> 45:03.040
Need to clean it, but it's beautiful,
there's a sea view.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.480
It's nice here.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.240
I want you to live here with me.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.640
Hi.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.160
It's good to see you again.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.520
You haven't changed at all
since the last time I saw you.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.280
You have, though.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.120
Besides, between the two of us,
I was the looker.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.680
And what was I?

46:23.640 --> 46:25.160
A gangster...

46:26.720 --> 46:29.160
who took everything I had,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
starting with my husband.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.760
-You're dredging up ancient history.
-Not for me.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.680
Not one day's gone by
I haven't thought about it.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.320
So?

46:47.040 --> 46:51.080
Why did you ask me to come here?
You got something to offer me?

46:51.920 --> 46:53.560
Sara Monaschi.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.240
