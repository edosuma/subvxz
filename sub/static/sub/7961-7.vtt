WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:03.848
One good witness. That's the
wedge that cracks everything open.

00:03.848 --> 00:05.414
It's a settlement or it's court.

00:05.414 --> 00:08.322
I just want to know that I
have your help, Evy's help.

00:08.357 --> 00:10.958
You keep putting this on us.
This is not even our school.

00:10.993 --> 00:12.225
Are you gay?

00:12.261 --> 00:14.194
Mom said that's why you
tried to kill yourself.

00:14.229 --> 00:15.295
I don't want to ride with him.

00:15.331 --> 00:16.763
I don't want to be around him.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.864
- Mom doesn't...
- Peter!

00:17.900 --> 00:19.366
What the hell?

00:21.337 --> 00:22.302
I want to know when

00:22.338 --> 00:23.670
I can start to move away from it.

00:23.706 --> 00:25.238
I'm seeing a guy, and he doesn't get it.

00:25.274 --> 00:26.373
You're having problems

00:26.408 --> 00:27.474
articulating the things that you're feeling.

00:27.509 --> 00:28.575
And writing it in some book does what?

00:28.611 --> 00:30.477
Expressing yourself gives a name

00:30.512 --> 00:31.678
to what you have to confront.

00:31.714 --> 00:32.980
That dude is a straight bitch.

00:33.015 --> 00:35.015
There's, like, no reason
that he can't get handled.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.283
- Hello.
- It's Eric.

00:36.318 --> 00:38.719
We need to talk. I'm gonna
be at the rec center.

01:37.346 --> 01:40.447
We have been
locked in a cycle of pain.

01:40.482 --> 01:45.118
There is a pattern of hurt
that's formed around us.

01:45.154 --> 01:46.687
People have been wounded,

01:46.722 --> 01:48.855
and so they want to wound others.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.724
It has to stop. It has to.

01:51.527 --> 01:53.627
This is the first step.

01:53.662 --> 01:54.861
We understand

01:54.897 --> 01:57.798
that your daughter Evy's
been caught up in all this

01:57.833 --> 01:59.800
through no fault of her own.

01:59.835 --> 02:02.536
That's wrong, and that's unfair.

02:02.571 --> 02:04.838
So, to help make things right,

02:04.873 --> 02:07.340
the school will be willing...
Thank you very much.

02:07.376 --> 02:10.943
So, to help make things right,
the school is willing to agree

02:10.979 --> 02:13.814
to set aside money to go directly

02:13.849 --> 02:16.983
toward Evy's educational assistance.

02:17.019 --> 02:19.586
Tuition costs, tutoring, living expenses.

02:19.621 --> 02:22.389
That money is to be used at your discretion.

02:22.424 --> 02:24.157
We can use it how we want?

02:24.193 --> 02:27.794
You may use it however you see fit.

02:28.997 --> 02:30.964
Provided you agree to quit

02:30.999 --> 02:33.233
any claims that you may
have against the school

02:33.268 --> 02:35.836
now or in the future.

02:37.906 --> 02:40.340
You should know we are offering

02:40.375 --> 02:43.710
a similar settlement to the Blaine family.

02:44.813 --> 02:46.113
This is a lot of money.

02:46.148 --> 02:47.280
It's your daughter.

02:47.316 --> 02:49.583
It's your family.

02:50.719 --> 02:52.419
We think it's appropriate.

02:59.394 --> 03:01.528
Where'd you get this?

03:01.563 --> 03:03.630
It was posted online.

03:03.665 --> 03:06.199
- Is it true?
- It...

03:06.235 --> 03:09.136
It's against the law to have
people's medical records.

03:09.171 --> 03:11.371
Is what that says true?

03:11.406 --> 03:13.173
If you don't speak to it,

03:13.208 --> 03:15.942
other people are going to exploit it.

03:17.513 --> 03:19.379
I'm not ashamed.

03:19.414 --> 03:20.480
I had problems.

03:20.516 --> 03:21.882
Depressive psychosis.

03:21.917 --> 03:26.253
That's... That's very serious.

03:26.288 --> 03:28.388
I was a single mother.
I was barely getting by.

03:28.423 --> 03:31.324
It was getting to be... It
was getting to be too much.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.893
I felt a breakdown coming on.

03:32.928 --> 03:34.494
So you were institutionalized.

03:34.530 --> 03:37.297
No, no.

03:37.332 --> 03:39.499
I was hospitalized.

03:39.535 --> 03:42.903
I put Taylor with friends, close friends.

03:42.938 --> 03:44.304
I knew if I didn't do that,

03:44.339 --> 03:46.339
somebody was gonna take him from me.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.809
Taylor means everything to me.

03:48.844 --> 03:50.610
I did what I did

03:50.646 --> 03:54.981
so I could get healthy
and we could be together.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.616
How are you doing now?

03:56.652 --> 03:58.318
I'm good.

03:58.353 --> 04:03.056
Do you regularly see someone?
Are you on medications?

04:03.091 --> 04:06.059
Are you asking me because you care

04:06.094 --> 04:07.661
or because you...

04:07.696 --> 04:10.864
You just looking for
something to write about?

04:15.304 --> 04:17.504
Huh.

04:20.676 --> 04:23.543
Now, normally I wouldn't say anything.

04:23.579 --> 04:26.179
During the nightmare, I
didn't say anything publicly.

04:26.215 --> 04:28.048
You know, at some point,
though, it's got to stop.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.282
Okay.

04:29.318 --> 04:32.285
For this woman to say the
kinds of things that she said,

04:32.321 --> 04:35.388
for her to just demonize
people the way she's done, it...

04:35.424 --> 04:37.624
And then, okay, we... we find
out she's not only crazy, she...

04:37.659 --> 04:39.960
Okay, well, her medical records
were released illegally,

04:39.995 --> 04:41.161
- so her being crazy...
- Okay, hold on a second, okay?

04:41.196 --> 04:43.063
Let... let me just...

04:43.098 --> 04:45.298
Look. She's mentally ill.

04:45.334 --> 04:47.567
Now, I read up on that condition of hers.

04:47.603 --> 04:48.568
She's delusional.

04:48.604 --> 04:50.103
Medically, she's delusional.

04:50.138 --> 04:51.605
- But...
- She lost custody of her child.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.673
No, she claims she did not lose custody.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.306
- She voluntarily gave up custody
- What kind of parent would ever...

04:55.306 --> 04:56.550
until she had recovered.

04:56.550 --> 04:58.411
Look, every step of the way, she lied.

04:58.447 --> 04:59.980
That kid of hers lied.

05:00.015 --> 05:01.481
Now, you saw the e-mails,

05:01.516 --> 05:03.717
the texts that he sent to my player.

05:03.752 --> 05:05.452
And those drugs that he
was supposedly given?

05:05.487 --> 05:07.454
I wouldn't be surprised if
he was taking them himself.

05:07.489 --> 05:08.655
Does it bother you

05:08.690 --> 05:11.758
that her medical records
were released illegally?

05:13.829 --> 05:16.830
It bothers me that that family,

05:16.899 --> 05:18.932
that they tormented one of my kids

05:18.967 --> 05:21.501
to the point where he almost killed himself.

05:22.671 --> 05:24.604
That bothers me.

05:25.874 --> 05:27.173
It went well?

05:27.209 --> 05:29.609
I got my points across, yeah.

05:29.645 --> 05:32.078
I can only imagine.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.547
And I'm so glad you had
the opportunity to do it.

05:34.583 --> 05:37.918
Somebody needed to speak about
that woman and what she did.

05:37.953 --> 05:39.152
Are you adding anything to it?

05:39.187 --> 05:40.420
Are you talking to the reporter?

05:40.455 --> 05:42.188
Me? No. Your word matters.

05:42.224 --> 05:43.556
You represent the team.

05:43.592 --> 05:46.626
You represent young men
whose lives have been ruined.

05:46.662 --> 05:48.962
You've been asking me for a
chance to defend your boys.

05:48.997 --> 05:51.064
I'm not defending. You got
me out there attacking.

05:51.099 --> 05:55.335
Meanwhile, you got this...
this way of saying nothing.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.271
Well, the school can't comment
on an ongoing litigation.

05:58.307 --> 06:00.340
Just... it feels like you're swimming

06:00.375 --> 06:02.042
and the rest of us,

06:02.077 --> 06:04.144
you know, we're just
sinking a little deeper.

06:04.179 --> 06:05.879
You think this has been easy for me?

06:05.914 --> 06:11.685
I sat in that boardroom and was torn apart

06:11.720 --> 06:15.922
because I wanted to welcome
back an openly gay student,

06:15.958 --> 06:17.991
your player.

06:18.026 --> 06:20.593
I never left you alone in this.

06:20.629 --> 06:22.295
We're partners.

06:22.331 --> 06:25.265
We arrived to this school together.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.601
I have a feeling we're
not long for this place.

06:28.637 --> 06:32.272
We could have done this much more correctly.

06:32.307 --> 06:35.909
You and I, we really could have.

06:37.546 --> 06:41.381
What do you know about that
woman's medical records?

06:42.651 --> 06:43.717
From what I've seen,

06:43.752 --> 06:45.919
they paint her in the worst possible light.

06:45.954 --> 06:47.520
But what do you know about them?

06:47.556 --> 06:49.055
I don't understand what you're saying.

06:49.091 --> 06:51.091
- I'm asking.
- No.

06:51.126 --> 06:52.993
You're implying.

06:53.028 --> 06:54.294
Please don't do that.

07:01.937 --> 07:06.006
Steph says that I'm too trusting.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.340
She's your wife.

07:07.376 --> 07:09.809
I can't really speak to that.

07:21.656 --> 07:24.090
Grace, I'm going to this seminar thing.

07:24.126 --> 07:26.192
I'll be back before classes end.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.428
Okay. Have fun.

07:28.463 --> 07:29.996
Yes. Fun.

07:53.922 --> 07:56.222
Uh, Grace?

07:56.258 --> 08:00.326
Did I leave my glasses just over...?

08:00.362 --> 08:01.494
Well...

08:01.530 --> 08:03.430
I-I-I'm just gonna check

08:03.465 --> 08:06.232
- if maybe I left them in Leslie's...
- Sure.

08:22.914 --> 08:25.581
Hey, it's Taylor. Please leave a message.

08:27.619 --> 08:30.219
Taylor, it's your mom.

08:30.255 --> 08:33.956
I feel like we've been missing
each other a lot lately.

08:35.659 --> 08:38.695
Trading phone calls, it just isn't doing it.

08:40.966 --> 08:44.234
I just... I just want to know you're okay.

08:45.570 --> 08:50.907
Taylor, there's some stuff online about me.

08:50.942 --> 08:52.108
It's nothing you don't know.

08:52.144 --> 08:54.677
It's... it's...

08:54.713 --> 08:56.880
It's about when, you know, I wasn't well,

08:56.915 --> 08:58.848
when I had to... when I sent you

08:58.884 --> 09:01.217
to live with Aunt Patty and Uncle Nate.

09:03.221 --> 09:04.754
Somebody put it out there.

09:04.789 --> 09:07.390
Somebody's, uh, trying to make me look...

09:09.027 --> 09:10.994
I-it doesn't matter what
they're trying to do.

09:12.797 --> 09:14.864
I'm not giving up on you.

09:16.435 --> 09:18.001
Okay?

09:18.036 --> 09:20.103
I'm not.

09:20.138 --> 09:21.805
I love you, Taylor.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.273
I do.

09:23.308 --> 09:24.774
I love you.

09:35.754 --> 09:37.354
You still hurt?

09:39.691 --> 09:42.058
You need to see somebody.

09:42.094 --> 09:43.293
No.

09:43.328 --> 09:46.262
No, just for the pain.

09:46.298 --> 09:48.898
They're, um...

09:48.934 --> 09:50.467
They're messing with my mom.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.569
They're going online and they're...

09:52.604 --> 09:53.803
They're saying stuff.

09:53.839 --> 09:55.405
You can't do nothing about it.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.707
You need to worry about
getting yourself right.

09:57.743 --> 10:01.311
Or... or go to the cops.
That's what you need to do.

10:07.786 --> 10:09.786
Taylor.

10:09.821 --> 10:11.621
Taylor, come on.

10:12.858 --> 10:14.224
Taylor, what are you...

10:18.864 --> 10:19.829
Terri?

10:19.865 --> 10:20.797
Hey.

10:20.832 --> 10:23.233
Could I close the door for a second?

10:23.268 --> 10:25.001
It's nothing bad.

10:26.438 --> 10:29.272
Really I'm just checking in to
see how you're holding up.

10:29.307 --> 10:34.310
Um, you know, I'm... I'm spent.

10:34.346 --> 10:35.512
I don't know if you saw

10:35.547 --> 10:37.147
that stuff online this
morning about that woman.

10:37.215 --> 10:40.950
Uh, you know, Anderson, I-I can't even care.

10:40.986 --> 10:42.685
The lies, the accusations.

10:42.721 --> 10:44.320
Our son was damaged,

10:44.356 --> 10:48.291
and right now, I need to focus on Kevin,

10:48.326 --> 10:51.094
I need to work on my family, I...

10:51.129 --> 10:53.830
I need to work on me.

10:53.865 --> 10:57.233
I did things that I don't
admire in other people.

10:57.269 --> 11:00.804
But here is where I
need to start rebuilding.

11:00.839 --> 11:02.372
You know, this has all...

11:02.407 --> 11:04.607
It's all played out very publicly,

11:04.643 --> 11:05.775
and when things...

11:05.811 --> 11:07.410
It... it doesn't make it any easier

11:07.446 --> 11:09.913
- to focus on what you need to focus on.
- No, it doesn't.

11:11.950 --> 11:13.750
If you need to take some time off...

11:13.785 --> 11:14.751
Oh, no, no.

11:14.786 --> 11:16.519
Here is where I need to be.

11:16.555 --> 11:17.954
Work is good for me.

11:17.989 --> 11:20.390
I get it. I do.

11:20.425 --> 11:23.426
But if you need to reduce your profile,

11:23.462 --> 11:25.595
we'd understand that.

11:26.865 --> 11:28.364
Okay.

11:31.269 --> 11:33.336
Is this coming from you,

11:33.371 --> 11:35.605
or is this coming from corporate?

11:35.674 --> 11:38.141
I'm trying, really honestly,

11:38.176 --> 11:41.010
to keep that from coming from upstairs.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.613
Sure.

11:43.648 --> 11:46.950
Anything you need, just let me know.

11:46.985 --> 11:49.185
Thank you.

12:07.839 --> 12:10.773
Sebastian, you got a customer.

12:12.277 --> 12:14.010
Sebastian?

14:07.137 --> 14:14.300
__

14:14.300 --> 14:18.345
_

14:30.649 --> 14:33.183
We don't tolerate hate
speech at this school.

14:33.218 --> 14:35.652
Not from anyone, and not directed to anyone.

14:35.687 --> 14:37.587
It wasn't directed toward anyone.

14:37.623 --> 14:40.290
Your son spray painted a
slur on one of our walls.

14:40.325 --> 14:42.959
Things are going on at
home with his brother.

14:42.995 --> 14:44.628
Well, if it's a family matter,

14:44.663 --> 14:46.897
then you need to deal with it as a family,

14:46.932 --> 14:47.931
not in public.

14:49.401 --> 14:52.335
You're gonna talk to me about
dealing with things in public?

14:52.371 --> 14:54.471
I got... I got to walk
through a street protest

14:54.506 --> 14:55.772
just to get into the building

14:55.808 --> 14:57.374
- and you're...
- You can shift blame

14:57.409 --> 14:59.009
or you can deal with your problem.

14:59.044 --> 15:00.944
Okay, why don't you go deal with that?

15:00.979 --> 15:03.080
Come on.

15:03.115 --> 15:05.949
You need to get your son
in front of a counselor.

15:05.984 --> 15:08.485
You deal with that.

15:40.686 --> 15:42.252
Hey.

15:42.287 --> 15:44.020
Hey.

15:45.357 --> 15:48.158
What did you do to your face?

15:48.193 --> 15:50.594
I got stomped.

15:50.629 --> 15:52.295
Really? At Marshall?

15:52.331 --> 15:56.032
That school's so bad. You
need to get back to Leyland.

15:57.369 --> 15:58.602
What's that?

15:58.637 --> 16:00.470
Something for my counselor.

16:00.506 --> 16:02.439
I'm supposed to... I'm supposed to write

16:02.474 --> 16:04.141
about how I'm feeling,

16:04.176 --> 16:06.943
things I'm supposed to... confront.

16:06.979 --> 16:09.346
It's empty.

16:12.050 --> 16:15.619
Um, my head really hurts.
You... you have anything?

16:18.357 --> 16:20.857
I got some of my mom's good weed.

16:20.893 --> 16:23.760
But that's mostly for chilling.

16:23.795 --> 16:26.997
I have some oxy. Have you
ever tried that before?

16:27.032 --> 16:28.231
No.

16:28.267 --> 16:30.867
Well, don't gulp them
'cause they have a kick.

16:30.903 --> 16:31.868
How much?

16:31.904 --> 16:34.704
All of that... $100.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.440
I, uh, I got $68.

16:40.112 --> 16:42.379
I really need something.

16:47.352 --> 16:49.219
Work with this, and then if you get more,

16:49.254 --> 16:50.754
I can come back around.

16:50.789 --> 16:53.089
Thank you.

16:53.125 --> 16:55.659
Do you want to hang some...

16:55.694 --> 16:56.760
I got to get back to school.

16:56.795 --> 17:00.463
I really, uh, I need to
hang out with someone.

17:04.236 --> 17:05.969
Uh, I heard you were gay.

17:10.576 --> 17:14.109
I just... want to be with somebody.

17:16.548 --> 17:17.981
But how does that work?

17:18.016 --> 17:19.983
Just anybody turns you on?

17:37.002 --> 17:41.071
Drop those and just chill,
and you'll be good.

18:18.510 --> 18:20.410
What are you doing here?

18:20.445 --> 18:21.811
Why aren't you at school?

18:21.847 --> 18:23.413
Didn't feel like going.

18:23.448 --> 18:25.749
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

18:25.784 --> 18:27.951
You need to talk to your counselor?

18:27.986 --> 18:30.153
No.

18:30.188 --> 18:33.023
Well, if there's nothing wrong,
you need to go to school.

18:33.058 --> 18:35.258
You need to get back into a routine.

18:35.294 --> 18:36.259
What routine?

18:36.295 --> 18:37.260
Stop it.

18:37.296 --> 18:38.895
What's routine about my life anymore?

18:38.930 --> 18:40.530
Would you stop it? Would you stop it?

18:40.565 --> 18:42.465
Do you know what's
happening to your brother?

18:43.602 --> 18:46.303
Do you know what's going on with him?

18:46.338 --> 18:48.705
Eric!

18:48.740 --> 18:51.875
I need help with all of this.

18:51.910 --> 18:55.912
I am sitting here watching
my whole life fall apart.

18:55.947 --> 18:57.180
Just...

18:57.215 --> 18:59.549
I need to breathe.

18:59.584 --> 19:02.052
I'm supposed to do what?

19:02.087 --> 19:04.187
Help me.

19:04.222 --> 19:06.790
I'm always doing for you.

19:08.427 --> 19:12.062
All you ever tell me... Go to Leyland,

19:12.097 --> 19:13.830
get a scholarship so you can pay for school,

19:13.865 --> 19:16.900
be a big brother to that little...

19:21.873 --> 19:23.073
I'm supposed to go to that school

19:23.108 --> 19:24.307
where everybody calls me a freak.

19:24.343 --> 19:25.342
You come home pissed

19:25.377 --> 19:26.609
'cause I don't want to go back to that?

19:26.645 --> 19:28.378
You come in here and talk
about how you got to breathe?

19:48.915 --> 19:51.082
Hello?

19:51.117 --> 19:53.284
Uh, Anne... Anne Blaine?

19:54.420 --> 19:55.753
Yeah.

19:55.788 --> 19:57.922
Hi, Annie. My name is Sebastian.

19:57.957 --> 20:00.324
And... and I'm calling
'cause I wanted to, um,

20:00.360 --> 20:01.993
I wanted to talk to you about your son,

20:02.028 --> 20:03.594
your... your son and his situation.

20:03.629 --> 20:05.763
No, I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not doing interviews.

20:05.798 --> 20:07.765
I-I-I don't want an
interview. I want to help.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.667
See... see, I've been following
what's going on with your son

20:09.702 --> 20:11.135
and how they've been trashing him online

20:11.170 --> 20:12.703
and all the things they're saying about you.

20:12.739 --> 20:15.206
Wait, who... who... Who are you with?

20:15.241 --> 20:17.375
N-nobody controls the digital space.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.609
And I got two girls,

20:18.644 --> 20:21.012
and if anything ever happened to them...

20:21.047 --> 20:23.748
Somebody needs to pay for
what's going on with your son.

20:23.783 --> 20:25.316
I can help you.

20:26.652 --> 20:28.352
Don't call me anymore.

21:18.771 --> 21:20.571
For real?

21:20.606 --> 21:21.872
Eric?

21:21.908 --> 21:23.340
I thought you said you drove a muscle car.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.576
Well, if I said I drove a mini van,

21:25.611 --> 21:27.044
you wouldn't have hooked up.

21:28.148 --> 21:29.847
Todd's my real name.

21:29.883 --> 21:31.182
Okay.

21:31.217 --> 21:32.650
I like cars.

21:32.686 --> 21:35.019
I-I don't have anything cool,
but if you want to talk cars...

21:35.055 --> 21:37.789
- Forget it.
- Hey, Eric. Eric.

21:37.824 --> 21:39.957
I got a wife. I got a 2-year-old at home.

21:39.993 --> 21:42.293
I can't face them, man. I just...

21:42.328 --> 21:44.762
I need a little time to be me.

21:54.774 --> 21:56.474
How you doing?

21:56.509 --> 21:58.376
I'm okay.

21:58.411 --> 21:59.544
Just okay?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.345
Yeah, just okay.

22:01.381 --> 22:03.114
You got stuff going on?

22:03.149 --> 22:05.149
I'm all right.

22:05.185 --> 22:06.551
What do you like?

22:06.586 --> 22:08.853
Give, take?

22:08.888 --> 22:11.322
I just want to make out.

22:11.357 --> 22:13.357
You got someplace you like to go?

22:13.393 --> 22:15.493
No.

22:15.528 --> 22:18.129
Okay, well...

22:20.100 --> 22:21.866
This all right?

22:33.480 --> 22:35.313
Want a beer?

22:35.348 --> 22:36.948
Uh, no.

22:36.983 --> 22:39.016
I need a beer.

22:49.496 --> 22:51.229
It's gotten so I got to take one every time.

22:51.264 --> 22:52.797
I used to be able to get it up real regular.

22:52.832 --> 22:54.966
Not anymore.

22:55.001 --> 22:57.335
Maybe you don't want to do this.

22:58.538 --> 23:01.572
Got a wife, a kid.

23:01.641 --> 23:06.077
I-I know this... I knew
this kid in my school.

23:06.112 --> 23:08.312
Same thing.

23:08.348 --> 23:10.381
He said he was all curious or whatever.

23:10.416 --> 23:12.016
Turned him out.

23:12.051 --> 23:14.952
Started screaming about
how he didn't really want it.

23:17.157 --> 23:18.956
That bitch.

23:20.493 --> 23:22.493
You got a lot of anger in you.

23:22.529 --> 23:24.695
That's just where they all put it.

23:24.731 --> 23:28.866
You know, my mom and my dad,

23:28.902 --> 23:29.967
all the ass... on my team.

23:30.003 --> 23:31.335
I'm not trying to hear that.

23:31.371 --> 23:33.571
My brother thinks I'm
like a freak or something.

23:33.606 --> 23:36.607
He thinks that...

24:42.582 --> 24:44.248
Oh, my God. Taylor.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.050
I'm okay. I-I wrecked my bike.

24:46.086 --> 24:47.485
Have you seen a doctor?

24:47.520 --> 24:48.786
Yeah, he just, um...

24:50.590 --> 24:52.290
Could I get a water?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.759
Well, yeah. Yeah. Sit down.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.594
You don't have classes?

24:56.629 --> 24:59.597
- Tests.
- Oh.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.834
Have you been checking in with your mom?

25:02.869 --> 25:03.935
Yeah.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.169
'Cause Nate says

25:05.205 --> 25:07.004
she told him you haven't been checking in,

25:07.040 --> 25:10.875
and, you know, she's your mom, you know.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.348
Did she tell you that
they're getting on her,

25:17.384 --> 25:21.419
saying... saying things about her?

25:21.454 --> 25:23.187
What was that?

25:23.223 --> 25:24.489
It's nothing. Thank you.

25:24.524 --> 25:25.990
Yeah.

25:30.230 --> 25:34.899
Look, I know it can feel
like all she does is hover.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.401
But she loves you.

25:36.436 --> 25:39.670
You're her whole life.

25:39.706 --> 25:43.508
Everything she's ever done was just to...

25:43.543 --> 25:46.444
W-w... it wa... it wasn't easy for her.

25:46.479 --> 25:48.646
And you need to know that
she never, ever wanted to...

25:48.681 --> 25:50.515
Can I...

25:50.550 --> 25:52.250
I wanted to borrow some of Nate's tools.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.551
- I got to fix my bike.
- Yeah.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.053
It's in the garage.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.617
Can I use your bathroom?

26:26.653 --> 26:28.553
Yeah. Of course.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.883
Taylor.

28:05.919 --> 28:07.952
Taylor?

28:09.656 --> 28:11.789
Taylor!

30:15.415 --> 30:16.747
What are you... What are you thinking?

30:17.950 --> 30:20.117
I miss you.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.991
I love you, Taylor. You lied to me.

30:28.227 --> 30:31.395
Hey, be fun, all right?

30:31.431 --> 30:33.531
Be fun.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.399
- No.
- Do it.

31:38.073 --> 31:41.211
__

31:56.495 --> 31:58.595
You doing all right?

32:00.933 --> 32:03.267
You doing all right, Taylor?

32:05.571 --> 32:07.137
Yeah.

32:11.377 --> 32:13.444
Is, um...

32:14.914 --> 32:18.849
Is Dr. Graham gonna be back soon?

32:18.884 --> 32:20.551
Well, her seminar...

32:20.586 --> 32:23.554
She's probably still
speaking right about now.

32:23.589 --> 32:25.089
Do you want to make an
appointment for tomorrow?

32:25.124 --> 32:27.658
No, I'll wait. Um...

32:27.693 --> 32:29.927
Can I wait?

32:29.962 --> 32:31.729
You can wait.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.533
Are you thinking about
coming back to Leyland?

32:38.170 --> 32:40.704
No.

32:40.740 --> 32:43.240
Everything going all
right for you at Marshall?

32:43.275 --> 32:45.375
Yeah, it's all right.

32:45.411 --> 32:46.810
It's just, I heard they were having

32:46.846 --> 32:49.146
a lot of problems at that school.

32:49.181 --> 32:52.416
Some kind of a riot or something?

32:56.722 --> 33:01.391
Taylor, I have to say,
I thought you got a...

33:01.427 --> 33:04.595
I thought the school could have
handled your situation better.

33:06.232 --> 33:08.098
I see things here sometimes,

33:08.134 --> 33:10.868
and... I just think you deserve

33:10.903 --> 33:14.171
better than how you were treated.

33:14.206 --> 33:16.440
A lot of us do.

34:41.126 --> 34:43.193
Hey, what are you doing here, faggot? Huh?

34:43.228 --> 34:44.928
You ratting? Who you talking to?

34:44.964 --> 34:47.097
Who are you talking to?!
You better not talk!

34:47.132 --> 34:49.900
I will kill you! I will kill you!

35:47.192 --> 35:50.394
It is a fact of life that
unfortunate events occur.

35:50.429 --> 35:52.930
Not more so than in times past.

35:52.965 --> 35:55.032
But today when a crisis unfolds,

35:55.067 --> 35:57.801
it does so in a digital echo chamber

35:57.836 --> 36:00.337
which repeats and then
magnifies the situation.

36:02.241 --> 36:04.574
What one must first consider is

36:04.610 --> 36:08.011
what it is one is responding to.

36:08.047 --> 36:09.947
Is it rumor or is it fact?

36:09.982 --> 36:13.684
Each requires its own procedure.

36:32.237 --> 36:33.904
Has followed those procedures.

36:33.939 --> 36:35.672
Again, what we know now...

36:35.708 --> 36:38.442
A student here at Leyland
School has been shot.

36:38.477 --> 36:40.911
We do not know his or her
condition at this point.

36:40.946 --> 36:43.380
- Anne, that's your son's school, isn't it?
- But we do know that the shooter was seen

36:43.415 --> 36:45.682
leaving the scene just moments ago.

36:45.718 --> 36:47.617
We have heard from several eyewitnesses...

36:47.653 --> 36:48.952
He doesn't go there anymore.

36:50.823 --> 36:53.090
Mom?

36:53.125 --> 36:55.058
Taylor?

36:56.462 --> 36:58.795
Mom.

36:58.831 --> 36:59.963
I think I'm in trouble.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.631
You... you think you're in trouble?

37:01.667 --> 37:03.567
- No, I'm... I'm... I'm in trouble.
- You...

37:03.602 --> 37:06.269
Is now on the scene. They
are searching for the man.

37:06.305 --> 37:07.871
Unfortunately, there are conflicting reports

37:07.906 --> 37:09.539
of whether the shooter
is still on the campus.

37:09.575 --> 37:12.776
Where... is the gun?

37:12.811 --> 37:14.211
Police seem to have no idea

37:14.246 --> 37:16.313
if the shooter is still on the campus.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.819
Okay.

37:22.855 --> 37:25.989
Okay. Okay.

37:31.864 --> 37:33.964
Okay. Tay.

38:03.228 --> 38:05.262
What happened?

38:05.297 --> 38:06.696
I, uh, I went to the school.

38:06.732 --> 38:07.998
I went... I...

38:08.033 --> 38:09.933
Taylor, what happened?

38:11.170 --> 38:13.770
Look... look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye.

38:13.806 --> 38:16.540
They kept talking about you.

38:16.575 --> 38:19.876
Anne? Somebody's calling for you.

38:23.916 --> 38:25.182
Hello?

38:25.217 --> 38:26.917
Anne Blaine, this is Officer Grant

38:26.952 --> 38:28.518
with the Indianapolis Police.

38:28.554 --> 38:30.854
We're calling in regard
to your son's whereabouts.

38:32.024 --> 38:33.757
Mrs. Blaine?

38:33.792 --> 38:34.958
Yes?

38:34.993 --> 38:37.427
Do you know where your son is?

38:38.263 --> 38:39.863
What about Taylor?

38:39.898 --> 38:43.533
Mrs. Blaine, do you know where Taylor is?

39:05.824 --> 39:07.324
It's okay. Please. Where is it?

39:07.359 --> 39:08.658
Has been shot.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.694
We do not know his or her
condition at this point.

39:10.729 --> 39:12.762
But we do know that the shooter was seen

39:12.798 --> 39:14.564
leaving the scene just moments ago.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.866
Please.

39:15.901 --> 39:17.067
We have heard from several eyewitnesses...

39:17.102 --> 39:18.502
Put it down.

39:18.537 --> 39:20.070
Now says the first shots
rang out just after...

39:20.105 --> 39:21.438
- Put it down.
- At that point,

39:21.473 --> 39:23.640

39:25.010 --> 39:27.277

Okay?

39:42.094 --> 39:43.860
Okay.

39:56.308 --> 39:58.341
Um...

40:06.051 --> 40:08.818
911. Police, fire, or medical?

40:08.854 --> 40:11.555

40:11.590 --> 40:12.989
Who is this?

40:13.025 --> 40:14.057

40:14.092 --> 40:16.927
You're... you're trying to find my son.

40:16.962 --> 40:18.161
He's with me. He's not armed.

40:18.197 --> 40:19.563
Where are you?

40:19.598 --> 40:21.064

40:21.099 --> 40:22.732
We are at Catcher's on Douglas.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.601
Ma'am, I need you to leave the premises

40:24.636 --> 40:26.469

40:26.505 --> 40:28.004

40:28.040 --> 40:29.906

40:29.942 --> 40:31.841
It's okay.

40:31.877 --> 40:35.312

40:35.347 --> 40:36.813
Get everyone out of here.

40:36.848 --> 40:37.914

40:37.950 --> 40:39.516
Get everyone out of here right now.

40:39.551 --> 40:41.251
Right now!

40:49.561 --> 40:51.828
Can I have your attention?

40:51.863 --> 40:54.531
If everyone could please...

40:54.566 --> 40:56.199
If we could please have everyone

40:56.235 --> 40:58.468
step out of the building.

40:58.503 --> 41:00.770
If everyone could...

41:00.806 --> 41:04.441
Just step on outside for a minute.

41:04.476 --> 41:06.142
Thank you.

41:13.185 --> 41:14.451
Now, what we know so far

41:14.486 --> 41:16.152
is that the school was
placed on the lockdown

41:16.188 --> 41:18.288
shortly after the shooting was reported.

41:18.323 --> 41:19.605
Schools have procedures to deal with

41:19.605 --> 41:20.685
events such as this,

41:20.685 --> 41:22.259
and from what we know,

41:22.294 --> 41:24.694
this school has followed those procedures.

41:24.730 --> 41:26.463
Again, what we know now...
