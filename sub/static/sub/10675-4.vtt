00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.008 --> 00:10.581
- Lunch is ready.
- I'll grab the plates.

00:10.581 --> 00:13.714
Oh, just like you grabbed
the heart of the girl I love?

00:13.714 --> 00:17.748
Still not over me getting
Skylar her powers back, huh?

00:17.748 --> 00:20.121
Nope. And you'll notice
your tomato slice

00:20.121 --> 00:23.124
is very thin.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.496
Wow, you showed him.

00:25.496 --> 00:28.229
Yeah, I also
skimped on his lettuce.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.462
Oh, no, stop the madness.

00:32.703 --> 00:34.465
I will get the plates.

00:36.807 --> 00:40.241
Why are they all broken?
What happened?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.073
I was doing the dishes,

00:42.073 --> 00:44.715
and I accidentally broke them
with my super strength.

00:44.715 --> 00:46.917
That still doesn't answer
why you put them
back in the cabinet.

00:46.917 --> 00:51.252
Because now we have service
for 36 tiny people.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.424
Hey, guys.

00:53.424 --> 00:54.725
Hey, Kaz, I didn't
smell you come in.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.257
Did you shower?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.659
Yeah, I had to.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.332
My younger brother Kyle's
coming to visit,

01:01.332 --> 01:06.036
and the pen I was chewing on
exploded all over my face.

01:06.036 --> 01:08.839
I didn't know
you had a little brother.

01:08.839 --> 01:11.772
Yeah, well, growing up,
Kyle and I never really bonded,

01:11.772 --> 01:13.944
but now that he's older
and I moved away,

01:13.944 --> 01:15.406
I think he misses me.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.748
This is our chance to
finally become best buds.

01:17.748 --> 01:19.750
- ( doorbell chimes )
- That's him.

01:23.854 --> 01:26.187
- Kyle!
- The bionic people!

01:29.260 --> 01:31.962
Wow. If I didn't
know any better,

01:31.962 --> 01:34.365
I'd think you're more excited
to see them than me.

01:34.365 --> 01:36.197
I am.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.376
So when my mom told me

02:25.376 --> 02:27.418
that Kaz was an intern
with the bionic people,

02:27.418 --> 02:29.850
I just had to come
see for myself.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.583
Okay, well, now you saw 'em,
so what do you say

02:32.583 --> 02:35.025
you and I get outta here
and take our chances

02:35.025 --> 02:37.358
eating some street meat.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.791
Kaz, do you mind?
The grown-ups are talking.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.396
I can't believe
I'm sitting next to

02:45.396 --> 02:46.837
the Chase Davenport.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.139
You're my favorite
bionic hero.

02:49.139 --> 02:52.673
I get that
all the time.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.005
Really? 'Cause I've
never heard that.

02:55.005 --> 02:58.609
Seriously. Never.
Not one time.

02:58.609 --> 03:02.413
Wow. She does not
like you.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.156
Okay, Kyle,
your room's all set.

03:06.156 --> 03:07.988
Thanks. Wait till
my friends hear

03:07.988 --> 03:09.920
that Bionic Bree
made my bed.

03:11.522 --> 03:13.994
Or more accurately,

03:13.994 --> 03:16.827
Bionic Bree threw
your backpack
into an empty room.

03:18.229 --> 03:19.700
Great.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.572
So this entire time,

03:21.572 --> 03:23.774
I thought he was excited
to come see me,

03:23.774 --> 03:25.906
but really, he was using me
to get to you guys.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.078
( chuckles )
Yeah. How about that?

03:29.740 --> 03:31.382
Come on, can you blame him?

03:31.382 --> 03:33.544
Who would wanna hang out
with the intern?

03:33.544 --> 03:35.085
Why did you tell him that?

03:35.085 --> 03:37.388
I was trying to come up
with a cover story.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.089
It was either that
or chauffeur.

03:39.089 --> 03:41.292
I didn't think I could
pull off the hat.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.755
Why am I even
lying to him?

03:44.755 --> 03:46.297
I'm just gonna tell him
that I'm a superhero.

03:46.297 --> 03:49.029
You can't.
The superhero code says

03:49.029 --> 03:52.102
that no hero can reveal
his or her true identity,

03:52.102 --> 03:55.035
thus exposing all heroes'
existence to the general public.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.237
Can't I make an exception
for my brother?

03:57.237 --> 04:00.010
No. People fear
the unknown.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.112
If they found out
that we have powers,

04:02.112 --> 04:03.974
they could turn against us.

04:03.974 --> 04:05.376
She's right.

04:05.376 --> 04:08.178
But just to be clear,
there is no code that says

04:08.178 --> 04:11.181
superheroes can't
date each other.

04:11.181 --> 04:13.354
I'll add it in.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.027
Okay, yeah, but
what about these two?

04:17.027 --> 04:19.159
The whole world knows
they're bionic,

04:19.159 --> 04:20.761
and they're
pretty much celebrities.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.793
Yeah, now.

04:22.793 --> 04:24.795
When we were first outed,
everybody freaked.

04:24.795 --> 04:26.297
And the only reason
they came around

04:26.297 --> 04:30.040
is because of
my likable charm
and charisma.

04:31.502 --> 04:34.104
Yeah, neither of which exist.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.109
We were able to explain
our abilities with science.

04:39.109 --> 04:43.213
Unlike fire, ice,
and ET over here.

04:43.213 --> 04:44.815
Please don't zap me.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.189
I'll take a zap.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.991
Or anything
at this point.

04:52.823 --> 04:55.195
Kyle is my only
younger brother.

04:55.195 --> 04:58.569
He won't tell anybody
that I have superpowers.
I promise.

04:58.569 --> 05:02.272
Sorry, Kaz. No.

05:02.272 --> 05:04.405
Kaz, you do not need
to be a superhero

05:04.405 --> 05:06.637
to bond with
your little brother.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.308
Just spend
some time with him.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.541
Yeah, she's right.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.516
Well, Bree, I can see
making beds

05:15.516 --> 05:17.888
isn't one of
your bionic abilities.

05:17.888 --> 05:21.321
( laughs )
He is so cute.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.953
How long is he staying?

05:24.124 --> 05:26.056
Hey, how about I give you
the grand tour, huh?

05:26.056 --> 05:28.359
Okay. Can Chase come?

05:28.359 --> 05:30.661
Oh, I'm sure
he's got plans.

05:30.661 --> 05:33.103
Nope. I never do.

05:39.269 --> 05:42.212
Consider yourself
lucky, Kyle.

05:42.212 --> 05:44.144
You're the first outsider
ever to see

05:44.144 --> 05:46.216
the heart of our
bionic operation.

05:46.216 --> 05:47.518
Cool!

05:47.518 --> 05:49.850
Yeah, but unfortunately,

05:49.850 --> 05:52.052
you'll have no pictures
of your historic visit

05:52.052 --> 05:56.026
because Chase made this
a camera-free zone.

05:56.026 --> 05:59.460
That's right. Chase.
Not me.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.062
Just to be clear,
it was the bionic guy.

06:03.734 --> 06:06.697
But instead of a picture
of Mission Command,

06:06.697 --> 06:10.741
how would you like
a signed 8 X 10 of me?

06:10.741 --> 06:12.142
It's super glossy,

06:12.142 --> 06:14.905
so my bionic smile
really pops.

06:16.907 --> 06:19.410
It totally does.

06:21.612 --> 06:22.983
What are you doing?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.415
It's no biggie.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.286
I've got, like,
500 of 'em.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.788
You want one?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.319
No.

06:29.319 --> 06:31.662
I'm trying to look cool
in front of my brother.

06:31.662 --> 06:33.063
You keep
one-upping me.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.327
Oh. I'm sorry.

06:37.327 --> 06:39.199
I didn't mean to.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.932
I mean, I can't help it
if he thinks I'm awesome.

06:41.932 --> 06:43.904
I am the smartest man
in the world,

06:43.904 --> 06:46.276
and I can generate
a force field,

06:46.276 --> 06:49.139
and I happen to be
having a very good hair day.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.111
Look, it's bad enough
I can't show Kyle

06:51.111 --> 06:52.983
any of my superpowers.

06:52.983 --> 06:54.985
Could you just
back off a bit?

06:54.985 --> 06:56.286
Absolutely.

06:56.286 --> 06:58.589
I'll give you two
some time alone.

06:58.589 --> 07:01.291
So you can talk about me.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.896
I'm sorry.
Uh, just keep him in here,

07:05.896 --> 07:07.798
and out of all
the unauthorized areas.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.630
Okay.

07:13.003 --> 07:14.535
Hey.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.266
Ready for
the rest of the tour?

07:16.266 --> 07:17.908
Where'd Chase go?

07:17.908 --> 07:21.271
Oh, you mean the guy
who seems awesome at first,

07:21.271 --> 07:23.443
but then you get to know him,
and you realize

07:23.443 --> 07:26.677
he's a not-awesome
fun killer?

07:26.677 --> 07:29.750
Yeah. I get what you mean.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.083
His powers are cool,
but he's kinda uptight.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.885
He's got all these rules.

07:34.885 --> 07:36.857
Yes. Yes, he does.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.789
And you know what else?

07:38.789 --> 07:41.291
He thinks that you shouldn't go
in the unauthorized areas

07:41.291 --> 07:43.193
because they're
too dangerous.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.735
Too dangerous?

07:44.735 --> 07:47.568
Hello. I skateboard off
people's houses.

07:48.639 --> 07:50.400
I know.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.272
But you're in luck,

07:52.272 --> 07:56.346
because I have access to
every room in this place.

07:56.346 --> 07:57.377
You do?

07:57.377 --> 07:59.580
Yeah. See, I didn't want
to tell you at first,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.411
but the truth is,

08:01.411 --> 08:04.314
I'm actually not
just an intern here.

08:04.314 --> 08:05.986
I'm running
this operation.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.488
Yeah, right.
You?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.521
Yes, me.

08:10.521 --> 08:11.962
I'm gonna prove it
to you right now

08:11.962 --> 08:15.626
by showing you
the top secret weapons room,

08:15.626 --> 08:18.028
which is right
through here.

08:22.472 --> 08:25.105
Which is right
through there.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.112
Guess what I found
in the washing machine.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.744
Ooh, I love this game.

08:33.744 --> 08:35.946
Uh, two buttons and a nickel.

08:35.946 --> 08:38.248
No. My tablet.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.851
I bet Oliver destroyed it
with one of his powers,

08:40.851 --> 08:43.293
and tried to hide
the evidence.

08:43.293 --> 08:45.355
Oh, no.

08:45.355 --> 08:47.197
Well, did he finish the load,

08:47.197 --> 08:48.629
because I had
a pair of jeans in there.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.031
You know what?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.563
That is it.

08:52.563 --> 08:53.864
First, he broke
all the plates,

08:53.864 --> 08:56.466
then he broke my tablet,
and now,

08:56.466 --> 08:58.669
I think it's time
for me to break him.
Where is he?

09:03.774 --> 09:06.076
Nice.

09:06.076 --> 09:08.518
Frozen chocolate
banana, Skylar?

09:08.518 --> 09:10.851
Why, thank you, Oliver.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.552
That's my favorite dessert.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.985
This is way better than
Chase getting my powers back.

09:14.985 --> 09:17.788
Silly girl.
It's just a banana.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.531
No. Listen to me.

09:21.531 --> 09:25.996
Oliver, you are the bestest,
strongest, handsomest--

09:25.996 --> 09:29.399
Ahem!

09:29.399 --> 09:30.801
Uh...

09:30.801 --> 09:32.542
Okay, to be fair,
this is not

09:32.542 --> 09:33.974
the weirdest thing
I've ever done.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.206
Save it.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.208
Look, I knew you
broke my tablet.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.881
- What? No, I didn't.
- Don't play dumb with me.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.984
You and your messed-up powers
have been breaking stuff
all over the house.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.186
Bree, I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.788
Besides the plates,
I didn't break anything.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.491
So I suppose that telescope
just broke itself.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.524
Okay, yeah,
that was me,

09:54.524 --> 09:56.266
but it wasn't
my powers.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.729
I just get really excited
when I see Mercury.

09:58.729 --> 10:01.972
Look, it is one thing
to accidentally break something,

10:01.972 --> 10:03.974
but it's another thing
to hide it,

10:03.974 --> 10:06.276
and then lie to my face
about it.

10:06.276 --> 10:09.139
I didn't lie, and I'm actually
getting better with my powers.

10:09.139 --> 10:10.681
Oh, yeah?

10:10.681 --> 10:12.382
Well, here's a reality
check for you, Oliver.

10:12.382 --> 10:14.344
You may think you're
getting better,

10:14.344 --> 10:16.546
but the rest of us know
that you're not.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.854
I'm sorry you had to see that,
imaginary Skylar.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.331
And here we are.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.304
This place is awesome.

10:34.304 --> 10:38.268
Yeah, well, just another
day at the office for me, Kyle.

10:38.268 --> 10:40.941
I guess I'm a lot
cooler than you thought.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.313
Yeah, but to be fair,

10:43.313 --> 10:44.845
the bar was pretty low.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.278
What is this thing?

10:49.680 --> 10:51.922
Oh, that is a mainframe.

10:51.922 --> 10:53.523
What's a mainframe?

10:53.523 --> 10:57.227
It's a complicated system
of...

10:57.227 --> 10:59.659
mains and frames.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.631
What does it do?

11:01.631 --> 11:05.335
Oh, sorry, that is
top secret.

11:05.335 --> 11:08.939
But I'm your brother,
and I'm great with secrets.

11:08.939 --> 11:10.801
Kevin Stuart asked me
not to tell anyone

11:10.801 --> 11:12.703
about his year-old
back zit,

11:12.703 --> 11:15.205
and I only told,
like, three people.

11:15.205 --> 11:17.407
Sorry, buddy.
No can do.

11:17.407 --> 11:19.249
We should probably
head back upstairs.

11:19.249 --> 11:20.711
All right, let's go see
what Chase is doing.

11:20.711 --> 11:22.412
What's a few more minutes?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.385
Just try not to...

11:25.385 --> 11:27.357
( buttons clicking,
alarm blares )

11:27.357 --> 11:29.890
...touch anything.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.422
Intruder detected.

11:32.422 --> 11:34.965
Uh, hey, Kyle, you should
probably get outta there.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.929
Lockdown complete.

11:38.929 --> 11:42.202
Activating electrified
perimeter.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.703
Cool!

11:45.375 --> 11:48.408
Hey, uh, buddy,
quick question.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.680
When did you tell Mom
that you'd be home?

11:50.680 --> 11:53.513
'Cause right now,
it's looking like never.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.622
Come on, you got about
two inches here.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.494
Can you fit
through this?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.057
What is that alarm
going off?

12:07.057 --> 12:09.229
Why are you in here?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.501
( shrieks )

12:11.501 --> 12:13.063
What did you do?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.606
I was showing Kyle around,

12:16.606 --> 12:18.308
and then, all of a sudden,
the gates locked,

12:18.308 --> 12:21.471
got all electric-y,
that thing starts blaring.

12:21.471 --> 12:24.644
Don't you people have alarms
that are a little less jarring?

12:24.644 --> 12:28.018
Perhaps some wind chimes or
the gentle chirp of a cricket?

12:28.018 --> 12:32.022
I can mute the alarm,
but the cage is locked
for security reasons.

12:32.022 --> 12:33.483
Why did you even
let him in there?

12:33.483 --> 12:35.786
To prove that
I'm cooler than you.

12:35.786 --> 12:38.358
I think it's working.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.730
He initiated lockdown mode.

12:40.730 --> 12:42.993
I'll have to
disarm it remotely.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.636
- ( beeping )
- Oh, come on.

12:46.636 --> 12:48.598
Why isn't
my password working?

12:48.598 --> 12:50.240
Did Kyle touch something?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.671
Of course
he touched something.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.673
He's my brother;
we're touchers.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.345
Well, great.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.607
Whatever buttons he pushed
changed my password.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.349
Now he's locked in there,

12:59.349 --> 13:01.151
and I'm gonna have to
use my bionics to get him out.

13:01.151 --> 13:02.712
Yes! Awesome!

13:02.712 --> 13:04.514
Oh, it's not that awesome.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.119
What if I just used
these steel bolt cutters
to cut through the cage?

13:09.119 --> 13:11.391
No. If you touch
metal to the cage,

13:11.391 --> 13:13.123
the jolt will
electrocute you in an instant.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.765
Let me try using
my molecular kinesis
to control them.

13:21.271 --> 13:22.873
Whoa!

13:22.873 --> 13:24.274
Stand back, Kyle.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.142
- Chase!
- Is he okay?

13:32.142 --> 13:34.544
Yeah, I think so.

13:34.544 --> 13:36.686
But I have to say,
for a bionic hero,

13:36.686 --> 13:38.148
that was very disappointing.

13:44.624 --> 13:48.098
( crashing noises )

13:48.098 --> 13:51.031
Oliver, I thought
I told you no more...

13:52.732 --> 13:54.004
Skylar?

13:54.004 --> 13:56.736
Hi.

13:56.736 --> 14:00.510
Why is the coat rack
smoking?

14:00.510 --> 14:02.943
It is?

14:02.943 --> 14:06.416
Oh, it is.

14:06.416 --> 14:12.452
And is that my brand-new
expensive leather jacket

14:12.452 --> 14:13.653
that was on the rack?

14:13.653 --> 14:16.626
No.

14:16.626 --> 14:19.129
Give me that.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.191
( whimpering )

14:21.191 --> 14:23.193
Skylar, how could you do this?

14:23.193 --> 14:25.535
Okay, it was an accident.

14:25.535 --> 14:27.337
I just haven't quite
mastered my powers
since I got them back.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.369
So you burn my jacket?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.801
And I broke your tablet.

14:31.801 --> 14:33.673
And I shredded your purse.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.845
- My purse?!
- Oh, you haven't
seen that yet?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.379
That's great.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.712
Now I have to go
apologize to Oliver

14:42.712 --> 14:45.655
because I blamed him
for everything that you did.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.687
I know.

14:47.687 --> 14:51.121
And... I'm really sorry.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.693
I'm just scared, Bree.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.995
What if I never
get my powers back

14:54.995 --> 14:56.666
to the way that
they used to be?

14:56.666 --> 14:59.769
Skylar, you will.

14:59.769 --> 15:03.133
It's just gonna take
a little bit of time

15:03.133 --> 15:04.634
to get used to them again.

15:04.634 --> 15:07.277
It's like riding a bike.

15:07.277 --> 15:10.840
Or whatever your alien
equivalent is to riding a bike.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.642
That would be
riding a bike.

15:12.642 --> 15:15.215
I'm trying to make a point.
Don't start acting normal now.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.121
( alarm blaring )

15:21.121 --> 15:23.123
Hey, you okay?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.996
( groans )
I taste metal.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.858
Yeah. Must be from
the voltage your body absorbed.

15:28.858 --> 15:31.761
( metal clanking )

15:31.761 --> 15:34.434
Or it was a piece
of the bolt cutter.

15:36.906 --> 15:38.708
Help!

15:38.708 --> 15:40.910
When the bolt cutters
hit the cage,

15:40.910 --> 15:43.413
it must've caused
the voltage to surge.

15:43.413 --> 15:45.045
If you knew
this wasn't safe,

15:45.045 --> 15:46.676
why would you
let me in here?

15:46.676 --> 15:48.478
You wanted to go
in there.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.820
What do I know?
I'm just a kid.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.983
I still sleep in
a race car bed.

15:52.983 --> 15:57.387
Mom and Dad never bought me
a race car bed.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.190
Gotta know how to work 'em.

16:04.594 --> 16:06.436
Chase, we have to
do something.

16:07.937 --> 16:09.769
Feet.

16:11.541 --> 16:13.173
( yells )

16:13.173 --> 16:15.205
Get me out of here!

16:15.205 --> 16:16.906
Okay, I can figure this out.

16:16.906 --> 16:18.848
There's a reason why
I'm in charge of this place.

16:18.848 --> 16:21.751
Please. If the guy with
bionics couldn't help me,

16:21.751 --> 16:23.753
what chance do you have?

16:23.753 --> 16:26.116
What chance do I have?

16:26.116 --> 16:28.988
I'll show you
what chance I have.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.073
What do you think of
your big brother now, huh?

16:43.073 --> 16:46.306
( screaming )

16:46.306 --> 16:50.540
Not exactly the response
I was hoping for.

16:52.742 --> 16:55.245
Hey, Oliver.

16:55.245 --> 16:58.888
Uh, is this a bad time?

16:58.888 --> 17:01.621
Are you still talking
to pretend Skylar?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.654
Don't be ridiculous.

17:04.654 --> 17:06.656
Can't you see
she's sleeping?

17:09.299 --> 17:13.863
Look, I should not have
accused you

17:13.863 --> 17:15.705
of breaking my stuff.

17:15.705 --> 17:18.708
Especially now that I know
it wasn't you.

17:18.708 --> 17:21.711
Ha! I told you.

17:21.711 --> 17:23.243
I would never go around
breaking people's stuff

17:23.243 --> 17:24.974
without telling them.

17:24.974 --> 17:26.276
What kind of jerk
would do that?

17:26.276 --> 17:28.418
SKYLAR: Me.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.421
Oh.

17:31.421 --> 17:34.354
Well, when you do it,
it's adorable.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.957
It's taking me a while
to get used to my powers again.

17:37.957 --> 17:42.892
Rather than admit it, I blamed
you for everything I destroyed.

17:42.892 --> 17:45.335
I'm so sorry.

17:45.335 --> 17:46.996
Can you forgive me?

17:46.996 --> 17:48.968
Wow.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.201
It's just...

17:51.201 --> 17:55.145
The fact that you would throw me
under the bus like that.

17:55.145 --> 17:57.147
Yeah, we're all good here.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.852
Okay. Now things can finally
get back to normal around here.

18:02.852 --> 18:06.316
Oh, I wish I could
say the same for you, Bree,

18:06.316 --> 18:09.719
but you attacked my character
and accused me of lying.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.691
That's something
I can never forgive.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.964
Not even if I set up daily
one-on-one training sessions

18:14.964 --> 18:16.866
for you and Skylar
to perfect your powers together?

18:16.866 --> 18:19.829
Bring it in, old friend.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.305
Why should I have to
train with Oliver

18:25.305 --> 18:27.307
every day to pay for
something you did?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.479
Would you rather pay for
all the expensive things

18:29.479 --> 18:32.712
- of mine you ruined?
- Bring it in, old friend.

18:36.346 --> 18:38.888
( screaming )

18:38.888 --> 18:40.320
What's wrong, Kyle?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.091
What's wrong?

18:42.091 --> 18:43.923
My brother just shot fire
out of his hand.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.395
ALL: What?!

18:45.395 --> 18:48.398
Kyle, do not freak out.

18:48.398 --> 18:50.260
It's a little late
for that.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.903
Can someone explain to me
why he thinks he saw something

18:53.903 --> 18:56.406
that he clearly
didn't see?

18:56.406 --> 18:59.108
I would, but after
a few thousand
volts of electricity

18:59.108 --> 19:01.010
passes through you,

19:01.010 --> 19:04.013
your short-term memory
kind of...

19:04.013 --> 19:06.376
What's the word for goes?

19:06.376 --> 19:09.879
My brother locked himself
in the mainframe cage.

19:09.879 --> 19:12.121
I had to use one of
my powers to break him out.

19:12.121 --> 19:13.983
Wait. One of your powers?

19:13.983 --> 19:15.955
How many do you have?

19:15.955 --> 19:18.188
( chuckles )
Several.

19:20.830 --> 19:22.592
Kaz, now he thinks
you're a superhero.

19:22.592 --> 19:24.364
What was I supposed to do?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.965
He was in trouble.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.797
I have to tell him
everything.

19:27.797 --> 19:29.339
What about
the superhero code?

19:29.339 --> 19:31.401
I have no choice.

19:31.401 --> 19:33.042
I'm sorry.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.105
Kyle...

19:37.907 --> 19:40.410
I've been keeping
a really big secret from you

19:40.410 --> 19:42.382
and the rest of the world.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.913
I'm not supposed
to tell you,

19:43.913 --> 19:46.085
because it could expose
a lot of people

19:46.085 --> 19:47.517
and put them in danger.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.759
But you're my brother
and I think it's right

19:49.759 --> 19:51.291
for you to know the truth.

19:52.322 --> 19:54.163
Oh, I know the truth.

19:54.163 --> 19:57.967
These bionic freaks
abducted you,

19:57.967 --> 19:59.599
and filled you with
machine parts,

19:59.599 --> 20:01.371
to turn you into
one of them.

20:04.073 --> 20:06.005
Yes, they did.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.379
- ALL: Yeah!
- ( all talking at once )

20:09.379 --> 20:12.111
Technically,
technically,

20:12.111 --> 20:14.584
technically, I asked
them for the bionics

20:14.584 --> 20:17.987
so I could help them
save lives around the world.

20:17.987 --> 20:19.319
Right.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.420
But congratulations.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.492
You now have
a bionic brother!

20:22.492 --> 20:24.694
Yay! Isn't that cool?

20:24.694 --> 20:28.458
Yeah, I guess.

20:28.458 --> 20:32.462
I mean, it'd be a lot cooler
if you were a superhero.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.467
Superhero.
Do you hear this guy?

20:37.467 --> 20:39.208
Seriously, do you
hear this guy?

20:46.045 --> 20:48.077
That was the best
weekend ever.

20:48.077 --> 20:50.650
Well, as long as you
promise not to tell anyone

20:50.650 --> 20:53.453
about my bionic secret,
you can come back and visit
whenever you want.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.824
Really?

20:54.824 --> 20:58.187
Thanks.

20:58.187 --> 21:00.460
So when do I get
my bionics?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.092
Oh, you know,
I asked Chase,

21:03.092 --> 21:04.994
and he said no.

21:06.796 --> 21:08.368
I have to say,

21:08.368 --> 21:09.969
that was pretty
smart of Kaz

21:09.969 --> 21:11.641
pretending to be bionic.

21:11.641 --> 21:14.143
Yeah. Now that
I think about it,

21:14.143 --> 21:16.346
you should all say that when
using your powers in public.

21:16.346 --> 21:18.508
It's the perfect cover.

21:18.508 --> 21:20.049
All righty then.

21:20.049 --> 21:21.981
I guess from now on,
we're bionic.

21:24.714 --> 21:27.156
Seriously, Oliver?
These are my new boots.

21:27.156 --> 21:29.589
Sorry about that.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.562
Eh, it's okay. Skylar was gonna
ruin them anyway.

21:32.562 --> 21:33.563
( scoffs )
