00:31.509 --> 00:35.644
Can you hear me?

00:35.687 --> 00:38.995
I come to America nine years ago

00:39.039 --> 00:41.737
with my two boys and a husband,

00:41.780 --> 00:44.566
five and seven years old.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.872
We come to America because we believe

00:46.916 --> 00:50.006
America to be place
where dream come true.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.009
Work hard and you can make it.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.882
So my husband and I, we work very hard.

00:56.926 --> 01:00.495
Sixteen-hour days, seven days a week,

01:00.538 --> 01:03.585
no holidays, no weekends,

01:03.628 --> 01:07.067
and we do this every day
for about two years

01:07.110 --> 01:11.375
until we finally save enough money
to buy our own store.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.378
But when we buy our own store,

01:14.422 --> 01:19.427
we work even more because it's just us.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.212
We never see our children.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.736
I miss my boys so, so much,

01:24.780 --> 01:27.391
but I call them every day after school.

01:27.435 --> 01:30.786
My husband,
he reminds me why I work so hard

01:30.829 --> 01:33.832
in support my children's education--

01:33.876 --> 01:36.966
my children education in the future.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.163
No, I talked to him about the price.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.252
I talked to him about the price twice.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.254
It's just that, like--
I don't know,

06:25.297 --> 06:27.299
I知 just in a totally different headspace
right now.

06:27.343 --> 06:30.041
Like, I知 a mother and I have a kid

06:30.085 --> 06:31.608
and it's really intense

06:31.652 --> 06:34.219
and these are people who I feel like

06:34.263 --> 06:37.484
don't even know
what skin-to-skin contact is.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.094
They probably think it's some form of,
like,

06:39.137 --> 06:40.574
ultra thin condom or something.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.140
Like,
they're just not my people right now.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.884
- Hello? Hey.
- Hi.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.712
- Can I help you?
- I知 Sophia.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.192
Oh.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.194
Oh, I知 the task rabbit.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.674
- Oh, yeah. - You said you needed help
with reorganizing or...

06:53.717 --> 06:55.197
Okay, come in. Sorry.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.460
Yeah, no problem.
Oh, shoes on or shoes off?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.941
If you can take them off, yeah,
that would be great.

07:03.684 --> 07:06.034
Where do you want me to--
can I put my shoes?

07:06.077 --> 07:09.429
Um, you know what?
You can just put them right here.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.214
- Okay.
- Just put them--

07:12.257 --> 07:14.477
- Um, okay, that's fine.
- Is that--? Okay.

07:14.521 --> 07:18.002
Um, so...

07:18.046 --> 07:22.137
the baby's toys are a real disaster
right now,

07:22.180 --> 07:24.574
and he's just starting preschool

07:24.618 --> 07:27.795
and I really want him to start focusing,

07:27.838 --> 07:31.276
and so I was thinking of the best thing
to do-- I mean, do you have kids?

07:31.320 --> 07:33.496
- No, I don't have kids.
- No, okay.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.976
So, it's fine.

07:35.019 --> 07:38.762
Um,
I just really want the toys to be focused

07:38.806 --> 07:41.069
based on their objective.

07:41.112 --> 07:44.072
You know what I mean? So the bottom shelf

07:44.115 --> 07:46.640
should be toys with wheels

07:46.683 --> 07:49.207
that go in a specific direction,

07:49.251 --> 07:54.517
and the middle shelf could be
musical instruments that you blow.

07:54.561 --> 07:58.173
Oh, yeah, so you just want them
organized, like, per their function.

07:58.216 --> 08:01.176
Yeah, yeah, and then, like, maybe
you could even take it a step further.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.613
I mean, I know your--
On your profile it says

08:03.657 --> 08:04.962
you're, like, super organized.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.529
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.662
So you could do something where

08:08.705 --> 08:11.882
maybe they're organized
by size or by color, too.

08:11.926 --> 08:16.017
Just-- I really want to just
get his brain stimulated.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.150
- No, yeah, I get it. Yeah, no problem.
- Yeah.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.282
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.675
Um, and then also

08:21.718 --> 08:24.155
there's this weird spot right here.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.593
If you could just do this
while you're doing that,

08:26.636 --> 08:28.682
that would be great.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.554
- I just...
- Oh, I don't-- I知, um--

08:31.598 --> 08:33.774
You just spray it and just let it sit.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.993
- You know what? Sure.
- Okay, thank you.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.342
I actually--
I知 not, like, a cleaner.

08:38.386 --> 08:40.389
That's okay, though.
You don't have to be.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.957
- It's really easy.
- I'll just spray it and let it sit.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.349
You just spray it. Okay, thank you.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.613
Yeah, no problem.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.528
Nice to meet you.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.566
Hello.

09:26.609 --> 09:27.915
Hi.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.786
Wow.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.440
Who are you?

09:31.483 --> 09:33.398
Emmanuel.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.575
Oh, you're Emmanuel.

09:35.618 --> 09:39.274
I like your toys.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.277
Can I ride on your back like a pony?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.539
You want to what?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.368
Ride on your back like a pony.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.675
You want to ride on my back like a pony?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.809
Um...

09:57.597 --> 10:00.600
So...

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
Okay.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.394
Was that like a pony?

10:12.437 --> 10:15.092
Um, Alice?

10:17.312 --> 10:18.618
Alice?

10:39.900 --> 10:41.771
Fuck! Fuck!

10:44.339 --> 10:47.385
Hi, this is Sophie, your task rabbit.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.214
I知 sorry, um...

10:50.258 --> 10:52.434
I--
This is so crazy,

10:52.477 --> 10:55.829
but I知 just gonna be, like,
a few minutes late.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.360
Hello?

11:07.231 --> 11:11.453
Does anyone have a bike, a white bike,

11:11.496 --> 11:13.585
that's parked on the corner?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.383
Hey, is that your bike?

11:28.426 --> 11:29.427
Yeah.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.734
What--
what the fuck?

11:31.778 --> 11:34.171
It's not cool.
You locked your bike against mine.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.565
- You didn't see that?
- I知 sorry.

11:36.608 --> 11:39.089
- I知 so sorry. - What the fuck?
I missed my job because of you.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.701
I was supposed to digitize
this guy's high-8 tapes

11:41.744 --> 11:43.615
and now I知 like an hour late.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.705
Didn't you even, like, check?

11:45.748 --> 11:47.184
I didn't.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.884
Just-- Can you just, like--
Whoa! Sorry.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.276
You just dropped my bike.
You know that, right?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.843
Yeah, well, fuck that.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.847
Fuck you!

11:57.891 --> 11:59.806
No, fuck you!

11:59.849 --> 12:02.765
Fuck!

12:59.691 --> 13:01.476
- Ethan?
- Yeah, hi.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.608
- Hey.
- Sophia, nice to see--

13:03.652 --> 13:05.523
Hey, nice to--
Nice to meet you.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.568
- Come on.
- Um...

13:06.611 --> 13:08.788
I got, um, coffee.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.964
Oh, you ordered for me?

13:11.007 --> 13:13.314
- Yeah.
- That's so nice.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.969
- It's-- It's cool.
- I don't drink coffee, though.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.927
- Okay.
- Thank you.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.234
- Well, then I'll drink two.
- I feel bad.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.801
- No, that's okay. Don't worry.
- Thank you. Sorry.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.194
But I知 so happy
that you came to meet me today

13:24.238 --> 13:27.981
and I wanted to talk to you

13:28.024 --> 13:31.201
because I saw your stuff on YouTube...

13:31.245 --> 13:33.551
- Oh, which piece?
- ...and it blew me away.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.553
The supermarket piece.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.120
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.513
You know, if I知 not gonna get,

13:38.556 --> 13:41.777
you know, my voice in the institutions,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.867
then I知 just gonna take
this corporate grocery store

13:44.911 --> 13:47.043
and make it--
turn it into my stage.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.393
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and, so, that was really fun.

13:49.437 --> 13:55.399
I see you as this incredibly powerful
Asian American woman.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.662
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.230
And, uh, your-- You-- I was not--

14:00.274 --> 14:02.624
Your accent is incredible.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.757
You sound totally American.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.891
- Oh--
- You know, it's just in the--

14:08.935 --> 14:13.765
In the--
In the piece you, um--

14:13.809 --> 14:15.376
I guess you were doing your--

14:15.419 --> 14:17.117
Yeah, I was, like, impersonating...

14:17.160 --> 14:19.423
- Yeah.
- ...a character from the past.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.251
Yeah.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.949
- It's a-- It's a-- Yeah.
- So, she was an immigrant,

14:22.992 --> 14:26.953
- But I-- Yeah.
- Right, right, right.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.085
So, I have this film

14:29.129 --> 14:35.048
and there's an incredibly powerful role

14:35.091 --> 14:38.094
for an Asian American woman in it.

14:38.138 --> 14:42.185
And when I saw you doing your work,

14:42.229 --> 14:45.058
I thought you just were the part.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.755
If you want to know about it,

14:46.798 --> 14:49.845
it's about a social media conglomerate,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.543
and you would play a character

14:52.587 --> 14:56.025
who has a very powerful role
in the accounting department

14:56.069 --> 14:58.549
of this conglomerate.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.160
And it's, like, such a--

15:00.203 --> 15:01.813
I知 not sure
if I could really embody that

15:01.857 --> 15:03.815
because I知 not really good with math.

15:03.859 --> 15:06.514
You're not gonna be
crunching numbers onscreen.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.037
That would be so boring.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.257
- I know, but...
- It's about your dynamic.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.302
- ...I知 not sure that I could--
- It's your dynamic with this head guy,

15:12.346 --> 15:14.783
- And so--
- Wait, so the movie's about her?

15:14.826 --> 15:17.133
No, no, the movie is about him.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.875
- Okay. - And what he's doing
in the world right now.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
But this is
such an important counterpoint

15:21.964 --> 15:24.488
- so that he knows that, a...
- You said-- You said--

15:24.532 --> 15:27.839
...there are strong,
intelligent women in the work force

15:27.883 --> 15:30.190
that he needs to respect,
and that they are

15:30.233 --> 15:33.106
of, you know, many different backgrounds.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.846
- And that's what you would encapsulate.
- But didn't you--

15:34.890 --> 15:36.892
Didn't you say it was, like,
just a couple of lines?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.546
Yeah, it's a couple of lines.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.678
It's a very small scene,
but it's very important.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.767
Okay, I mean,
I壇 have to read the script.

15:42.811 --> 15:46.249
I don't know in what context,
but how could just, like--

15:46.293 --> 15:48.904
I mean, sorry, I don't know that--
This much about your world...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.862
- Right.
- But how-- I知 not sure

15:50.906 --> 15:53.778
that in such a few lines,

15:53.822 --> 15:55.302
you could get all of that across.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.651
Because you're talking about--

15:56.694 --> 15:59.001
it's not about the words.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.004
I look at you and all I see is
strength and will and determination,

16:02.048 --> 16:07.227
and that's all that I want you to bring
to this piece is that energy.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.088
What I didn't understand was

16:42.131 --> 16:46.396
why was this injustice then
redirected at Korean Americans?

16:46.440 --> 16:49.095
Why were the rioters mostly targeting

16:49.138 --> 16:52.185
and burning down Korean stores?

16:52.228 --> 16:54.404
Over 2,000 Korean businesses

16:54.448 --> 16:57.407
were destroyed, targeted, looted,

16:57.451 --> 16:59.801
burnt down during the L.A. riots.

16:59.844 --> 17:03.022
And then at the same time, the L.A. media

17:03.065 --> 17:05.894
was constantly creating and publishing

17:05.936 --> 17:07.113
ready-made racial tension

17:07.156 --> 17:10.855
by reporting on all the black crimes

17:10.898 --> 17:13.249
on Korean stores and violence.

17:13.292 --> 17:16.383
Black crimes on Korean stores
and violence.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.428
Repeatedly.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.909
For every robbery,
they would always mention

17:20.952 --> 17:23.259
that the store was owned by Korean-born

17:23.303 --> 17:25.479
and that the criminal was black,

17:25.521 --> 17:29.570
even if race
had nothing to do with the crime.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.572
After city tried to rebuild,

17:31.615 --> 17:34.444
they all take away our liquor license.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.882
Because liquor license,
they have to be active for 30 days.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.320
If not active, they took away.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.758
They say,
"unless it act of God like earthquake

17:43.801 --> 17:47.283
or earth--
or rainstorm, is not active."

17:47.327 --> 17:50.982
Huh? Oh, my God.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.768
Oh, my God, how is massive burning

17:53.811 --> 17:56.510
of your store not an act of God, huh?

17:56.553 --> 18:00.122
I not plan, huh? I not do, I not.

18:00.166 --> 18:04.126
Oh, Hananim, why city punish the victim,
huh?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.128
Why city take away our voice?

18:06.172 --> 18:08.391
We have no political power.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.350
We have no voice.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.048
Oh, Hananim, oh, Hananim...

18:14.484 --> 18:18.619
Oh, Hananim, oh, Hananim.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.421
Hey.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.249
Hey.

18:40.293 --> 18:43.383
Why are you talking about the riots?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.820
Um, hi.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.952
You don't recognize me, right?

18:47.996 --> 18:52.174
Um, we--
We...

18:52.218 --> 18:54.872
It must be, like, my costume.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.788
We had, like, a thing two days ago.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.226
- You-- Your bike.
- You.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.141
- Yeah.
- You.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.578
- I知 so sorry, actually--
- You are fucking crazy.

19:04.621 --> 19:08.408
I know. I actually--
I was thinking about you,

19:08.451 --> 19:11.324
because that's not really me.

19:11.367 --> 19:15.589
That's not who I am. I just--
You caught me in a really, like--

19:15.632 --> 19:18.331
Wait, so you went so fucking nuts on me

19:18.374 --> 19:20.985
and now you're here
talking about politics?

19:21.029 --> 19:24.641
- Like, I知...
- Well, I知 an artist,

19:24.685 --> 19:29.429
and I知 just--
yeah, I知 doing this performance here

19:29.472 --> 19:35.348
because I feel like it's a marginalized
part of history, untold history,

19:35.391 --> 19:37.263
that I wanted to revisit

19:37.306 --> 19:42.268
because it really reflects
our current state right now.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.966
- Do you think...? - I mean,
were you here during the L.A. riots?

19:45.009 --> 19:47.229
- No, I wasn't.
- Yeah, well, neither was I.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.144
But I know that--

19:49.188 --> 19:50.885
You know, I was doing a lot of research

19:50.928 --> 19:53.104
and, like, I was just a kid.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.498
Somehow the Koreans
were taking this blame

19:55.542 --> 19:57.500
for, you know, all, like,

19:57.544 --> 20:00.199
sort of the racial tensions go--
you know, happening.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.852
- And I just--
- Yeah, well, the woman shot--

20:01.896 --> 20:05.595
I mean, she shot the 15-year-old girl
in the back.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.467
That's not what my piece is about.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.643
I知 trying to explore that the media

20:09.686 --> 20:12.298
sort of took that footage and kind of--

20:12.341 --> 20:14.256
They're manipulating the people

20:14.300 --> 20:18.304
to kind of sort of misdirect
all the real issues.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.697
I feel like if we had real dialogue

20:20.741 --> 20:23.047
and if we could really talk
about these issues,

20:23.091 --> 20:25.833
we would know that we're,
like, actually connected

20:25.876 --> 20:27.661
and that we all want peace.

20:27.704 --> 20:30.054
Okay, well, I hear you talking,
and this is not dialogue

20:30.098 --> 20:32.883
'cause you're doing all the talking
and I知 just--

20:32.927 --> 20:34.320
If you want to have a proper dialogue,

20:34.363 --> 20:35.669
I want to talk to you about this

20:35.712 --> 20:37.888
because I find you so interesting,

20:37.932 --> 20:39.890
and you being here.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.110
But I feel like you're talking at me,

20:42.153 --> 20:43.503
you're not listening to me.

20:43.546 --> 20:44.982
- So...
- Yeah, sorry.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.420
- It's okay.
- I知 sorry, I just--

20:47.463 --> 20:49.857
You know, we had that thing

20:49.900 --> 20:52.773
and then I致e had some other,
like, friends of mine

20:52.816 --> 20:55.689
who are very dear friends,
like, you know, attack me

20:55.732 --> 20:59.432
and say that it was kind of like
anti-black and blackness.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.955
- And--
- Are you anti-black?

21:00.998 --> 21:03.479
- No, of course not!
- Okay, good.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.307
Course--
Are you kidding?

21:05.351 --> 21:08.092
Like, my best friends are, like--
yeah, like, whatever.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.529
- No.
- What I thought was interesting

21:09.572 --> 21:11.792
is how you embodied your culture.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.664
The voice, the empathy,

21:14.708 --> 21:16.666
the love, the understanding.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.103
That came from a very truthful place.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.367
- Uh, thank you.
- I appreciate that.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.020
I知 so sorry that I came at you.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.544
It's just been a really hard time.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.328
Like, everyone's--

21:26.372 --> 21:28.025
every time I look in the news,

21:28.069 --> 21:30.898
- there's another person being shot...
- Yeah.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.030
...there's another person
being pulled down the street,

21:33.074 --> 21:35.729
and I知 just so--
I知 just--

21:35.772 --> 21:38.297
That's exactly
what I知 trying to draw attention to.

21:38.340 --> 21:42.344
- Me, too. - Yeah,
so we're trying to do the same thing.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.954
- I think--
- It's cool, it's cool, girl.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.043
Like, fucking,
keep doing what you're doing.

21:46.087 --> 21:48.045
What's your name?

21:48.089 --> 21:50.918
- I知 Sophia. What's yours?
- Sophia. I知 Victoria.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.267
- Victoria.
- Nice to meet you.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.268
Nice to meet you.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.617
- See you around.
- Yeah.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.793
- 'Kay. bye.
- Thanks for--

21:56.837 --> 21:58.926
Thanks for coming to talk to me.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.276
You know, I really appreciate that.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.018
Thank you.
We're just trying to understand, right?

22:04.061 --> 22:05.759
Yeah. Yeah.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.587
- Peace.
- Bye.

22:41.229 --> 22:44.493
Go around. Fuck.

22:44.537 --> 22:47.278
What the fuck is the matter
with these people?

22:47.322 --> 22:49.803
Just go around.

24:17.456 --> 24:22.722
# Who watched the dog? #

24:24.506 --> 24:29.598
# Lost in the fog #

24:31.121 --> 24:36.692
# Squat down below #

24:39.565 --> 24:43.482
# Jump to the snow #

24:45.658 --> 24:50.880
# Coyote call... #

24:52.578 --> 24:56.320
I don't know, I--
Like, it made sense to text you.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.409
- Uh-huh.
- And then as soon as I did it,

24:58.453 --> 25:00.934
I was like, "no."

25:00.977 --> 25:03.153
"Bring back the text! Bring it back!"

25:03.197 --> 25:06.766
Um, yeah, so I just wanted to see you
because, um...

25:09.943 --> 25:11.727
I don't know, I just, um--

25:11.771 --> 25:14.338
I keep thinking about you, you know.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.471
Okay. Uh-huh.

25:16.515 --> 25:21.258
I mean, I know--
I know it's been a while.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.130
Um...

25:23.173 --> 25:24.653
And, uh, I don't know.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.089
I just--
I was, like, curious

25:26.133 --> 25:28.135
about how you were and...

25:28.178 --> 25:31.486
I--
Like, what happened,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.009
you know? 'Cause I...

25:33.053 --> 25:34.445
With us?

25:34.489 --> 25:37.361
Yeah, what happened? I mean...

25:37.405 --> 25:40.234
I just always felt like there was no--

25:40.277 --> 25:42.976
Like, we--
like, day to day--

25:43.019 --> 25:47.154
Day to day, I loved being with you.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.548
And I loved you.

25:49.591 --> 25:54.161
I just felt like the priority was always,
like, your work,

25:54.204 --> 25:57.164
which was always pulling you in,
like, all these crazy directions

25:57.207 --> 25:59.296
and I was just kind of like--

25:59.340 --> 26:02.430
felt like I was always here for you,

26:02.473 --> 26:06.826
but, like, where was I being seen?

26:06.869 --> 26:08.436
I mean, we were living together.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.829
We, like, you know--

26:09.872 --> 26:11.526
We made all these compromises together.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.485
We were like a team.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.097
I mean, absolutely.
But it just felt like...

26:17.140 --> 26:18.925
And then, like, I don't know,

26:18.968 --> 26:21.449
like, out of the blue you're, like, gone.

26:21.492 --> 26:25.366
You're, like, not--
You're not, like...

26:25.409 --> 26:27.890
- I mean, honestly, when I...
- ...accessible to me.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.938
I don't doubt that you,
like, cared about me.

26:31.981 --> 26:35.376
I always knew that you did,
and you always made it super clear.

26:35.419 --> 26:38.118
But do you remember
when I went to visit my mom?

26:38.161 --> 26:39.554
Is that what this is about?

26:39.598 --> 26:42.209
Because you never--
You never said that.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.906
Of course I would've been there for you.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.778
I, like, love you.

26:45.821 --> 26:46.822
Of course I would've been there,

26:46.866 --> 26:48.302
but you ever asked me.

26:48.345 --> 26:52.393
For me, really, it just comes down to,
like...

26:52.436 --> 26:54.700
I don't know.
Maybe it was, like, the time--

26:54.743 --> 26:56.266
Like, the moment that we were together.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.704
I mean, some couples,
like, have their moment

26:58.747 --> 27:00.967
and then it's over.

27:01.010 --> 27:04.666
I just remember, like--
I don't know,

27:04.710 --> 27:06.537
I just remember, like,

27:06.581 --> 27:09.932
you holding me and telling me that...

27:13.719 --> 27:16.025
you know, that you, like, want to be...

27:18.854 --> 27:21.552
That, like, we were home.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.329
Hello?

28:02.768 --> 28:05.814
Can you hear me?

28:05.858 --> 28:10.297
So, in 1992, I was just a kid.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.952
I didn't really understand
what was happening.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.041
Every time I turned on the news,

28:15.084 --> 28:16.912
I壇 hear about some Korean grocer

28:16.956 --> 28:19.219
getting shot by black Americans

28:19.262 --> 28:25.051
or some rappers
rapping about how racist Koreans are.

28:25.094 --> 28:28.619
So I asked my parents, "What's going on?

28:28.663 --> 28:31.144
Why do black people hate us so much?"

28:31.187 --> 28:34.016
And then I remember at the time,
my best friend was black,

28:34.060 --> 28:35.757
Mikita Jackson.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.019
I, like, loved her,

28:37.063 --> 28:39.152
and I thought we were so close,

28:39.195 --> 28:41.328
but when all of this was happening,

28:41.371 --> 28:43.765
I couldn't even talk to her
or admit to her

28:43.809 --> 28:45.811
that I was having
all these awkward feelings.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.960
I don't know. I mean, like, you know.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.615
I知, like, at the restaurant
like seven days a week.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.617
- Oh, my God.
- I make no money.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.881
I cannot work.
I can't work a restaurant job.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.928
They would pay me
not to come to the restaurant,

29:15.971 --> 29:18.234
I知 such a bad waitress.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.845
- I don't know.
- Oh, man.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.237
They don't tell you in art school

29:21.281 --> 29:24.327
you have to, like,
marry rich or whatever.

29:24.371 --> 29:27.504
Yeah, that's what they should teach
in art school.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.769
- Marry rich.
- How do you trap the spouse

29:30.812 --> 29:33.293
- that's gonna be making the money?
- Support your artwork.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.121
The only people I know

29:35.164 --> 29:37.514
who, like, are continuously making work

29:37.558 --> 29:40.517
are the people whose, like,
husbands or wives are making...

29:40.561 --> 29:43.259
- Yeah, or you come from money, right?
- ...any money, yeah.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.959
Like, are we just making work
for our friends here?

29:47.002 --> 29:49.222
We're just, like,
being privileged bitches

29:49.265 --> 29:51.006
who, like, had, I don't know,

29:51.050 --> 29:53.313
somehow got lucky and went to art school

29:53.356 --> 29:58.318
and now we're, like,
jacking off into the art circle?

29:58.361 --> 29:59.928
- Like, masturbating?
- No.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.496
Like everyone's in a fucking circle jerk?

30:02.539 --> 30:04.324
Is it just, like,
self-indulgent to, like,

30:04.367 --> 30:06.065
be like, "okay, I can still be an artist"

30:06.108 --> 30:09.416
today when the world's,
like, going crazy.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.331
I don't know. I have to--

30:11.374 --> 30:12.941
I have to make stuff.

30:12.985 --> 30:16.162
If I don't make performances
or if I don't--

30:16.205 --> 30:18.817
If I don't find, like,
a way to express myself,

30:18.860 --> 30:20.383
like, I'll go insane.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.651
We've looked at this from every angle.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.611
We can't pull the trigger
on the initiative.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.395
- That's great.
- Yeah.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.570
- That was great.
- Okay, great.

30:33.614 --> 30:34.833
Yeah, how'd that feel?

30:34.876 --> 30:38.227
- Um...
- The-- Yeah.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.838
- Yeah, you're making a stand.
- Yeah, yeah, I felt like--

30:39.881 --> 30:41.100
Um, sorry?

30:41.143 --> 30:42.449
You're making a stand.

30:42.492 --> 30:43.711
- Right.
- Yeah.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.191
Would it be more helpful for you

30:45.234 --> 30:49.325
if you said it in, like, your native...

30:49.369 --> 30:51.066
dialect?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.286
What do you mean, my native dialect?

30:53.329 --> 30:56.158
Like in the YouTube spot.

30:56.202 --> 30:59.379
- Oh, no, that's not my--
- Yeah.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.076
English is my native dialect.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.905
I was just putting on
that character for...

31:03.949 --> 31:07.039
You want me to put, like,
an Asian character--

31:07.082 --> 31:09.084
- Yeah, do you want to do that?
- I mean, Asian accent on this?

31:09.128 --> 31:10.346
Do you want to, like, try that?

31:10.390 --> 31:12.653
Um, no. No.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.568
I just feel as though...

31:18.093 --> 31:21.749
I just feel as though
that would be so powerful,

31:21.792 --> 31:25.274
to hear that voice...

31:26.754 --> 31:28.364
come through at that time.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.934
I don't understand what her being, like--

31:32.978 --> 31:36.459
Having an accent has anything to do with,
like...

31:36.503 --> 31:39.941
She has had to overcome so much
with her family

31:39.985 --> 31:42.901
and her history in this country,

31:42.944 --> 31:46.034
and now she's actually been given a voice

31:46.078 --> 31:50.778
in a company that has an economy, like,
the size of Morocco.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.562
So this is a huge moment for her,

31:52.606 --> 31:54.390
and I think it would be so powerful

31:54.434 --> 31:56.740
if she was saying it--

31:56.784 --> 31:59.308
If she spoke in, like, broken English

31:59.352 --> 32:02.746
because just speaking English
is a challenge for her.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.880
That wasn't really in the script.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.187
It didn't say anything--

32:08.230 --> 32:10.711
She wasn't a foreigner in this company.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.539
No, but you're not a foreigner.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.367
- You just--
- But you're making her a foreigner.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.673
You're making her the other.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.023
Why does she have to have an accent?

32:18.066 --> 32:19.328
That doesn't make any sense to me.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.547
I don't understand what "the other" is.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.505
What is "the other"?

32:22.549 --> 32:24.551
Why does she have to have an accent?

32:24.594 --> 32:26.988
- She's, like--
- So, you won't try that?

32:29.817 --> 32:31.384
No.

32:31.601 --> 32:36.476
I feel terrible
that I致e made you uncomfortable.

32:36.519 --> 32:40.871
I知 sorry,
I知 having a hard time right now.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.833
I mean...

32:45.876 --> 32:47.095
I知 sorry.

32:49.010 --> 32:52.753
You're just so lucky...

32:52.796 --> 32:57.236
that you have this thing, this, um...

32:58.889 --> 33:02.719
This heritage and this power to speak

33:02.763 --> 33:07.333
and you have actually
something meaningful to say.

33:07.376 --> 33:10.945
I just--
I feel like

33:10.989 --> 33:13.382
my life is meaningless, you know...

33:13.426 --> 33:16.124
- I知 sure you have meaning in your life.
- ...in comparison.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.908
It's kind of like what you make of it.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.955
No, everything has been handed to me
on a plate.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.436
- What? - Everything
has been handed to me on a plate.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.568
I致e struggled for nothing in my life.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.179
Oh, I知 sorry,
I知 not gonna feel sorry for you

33:27.222 --> 33:28.832
'cause everything's been handed to you.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.052
I don't want you to feel sorry for me.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.185
I gotta--
I gotta go.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.665
- I don't want you to--
- I was just trying to be open-minded.

33:35.709 --> 33:39.278
- I was like, why don't I try something?
- I don't want this.

33:39.321 --> 33:42.368
I don't want this to be
the experience you had.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.545
It's--
I...

33:45.588 --> 33:47.938
You know, I got all up in my own shit

33:47.982 --> 33:52.247
- and it's not, um...
- It's okay, dude.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.815
Like, I tried it.
It didn't--

33:54.858 --> 33:56.295
I know, I just don't want you
to leave here

33:56.338 --> 33:58.384
feeling, like,
icky or anything like that.

33:58.427 --> 34:00.429
No, I don't feel icky.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.388
I mean, I do, but, like, that's cool.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.867
It's just some stuff came up for me

34:03.911 --> 34:05.521
- and I just-- No, I just--
- No, it's cool, we all--

34:05.565 --> 34:07.567
- No, hey. Sorry.
- Oh.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.960
I just, um--
Cool. Bye.

34:50.610 --> 34:54.396
# You remind me of a firework, boy #

34:54.440 --> 34:58.574
# You touch the ceiling,
you touch the floor #

34:58.618 --> 35:02.883
# You sparkle and burn,
but you take your time #

35:02.926 --> 35:08.671
# And I bet I could carry you
across state lines #

35:13.111 --> 35:16.462
# I壇 tell you why #

35:16.505 --> 35:18.203
# But I don't know #

35:18.246 --> 35:21.510
# It's simple and #

35:21.554 --> 35:23.730
# So complicated #

35:23.773 --> 35:26.907
# I could walk all day #

35:26.950 --> 35:29.083
# On the railroad tracks #

35:29.127 --> 35:32.304
# But there's much more #

35:32.347 --> 35:35.872
# To it than that... #

35:44.011 --> 35:47.797
# You know all of my secret ideas #

35:47.841 --> 35:51.758
# The ones I'm giving up on
and the ones I'll keep #

35:51.801 --> 35:56.110
# And everybody sees
a funny look in our eyes #

35:56.154 --> 36:01.898
# 'Cause we know that we already
won the sweepstakes prize #

36:05.989 --> 36:09.123
# I壇 tell you why #

36:09.167 --> 36:11.256
# But I don't know #

36:11.299 --> 36:14.694
# It's simple and #

36:14.737 --> 36:16.609
# So complicated #

36:16.652 --> 36:19.873
# I could walk all day #

36:19.916 --> 36:21.918
# On the railroad tracks #

36:21.962 --> 36:25.313
# But there's much more... #

36:25.357 --> 36:26.749
# To it than that... #

36:26.793 --> 36:28.577
I love that you just jumped right in.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.231
- Three times.
- Yeah.

36:30.275 --> 36:33.060
Three times in, like, a week. I...

36:33.103 --> 36:34.583
What are you doing?

36:34.627 --> 36:36.803
I just--
This is my spot. I come here to...

36:36.846 --> 36:37.934
This is my spot.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.110
This is where I come and...

36:41.677 --> 36:45.115
...give my appreciation, search.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.074
Yeah.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.945
Look at the sunset.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.908
Yeah, that's why I come out here.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.258
Hmm.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.528
Okay, I will have, um...

37:06.572 --> 37:08.574
four quesadillas.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.271
I知 sorry.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.881
Wow, you're hungry.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.970
I'll have a beef tripe.

37:15.842 --> 37:19.672
So, tell me about you. What's your story?

37:19.715 --> 37:21.978
I mean, what--
Are you from Los Angeles?

37:22.022 --> 37:24.503
No, I知 from Ghana, West Africa.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.679
- You know that?
- Oh, wow. Course.

37:26.722 --> 37:27.723
Wow.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.290
So, when did you come here?

37:29.334 --> 37:32.815
I致e been here for, like, 10 years.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.469
- Wow. Okay.
- Yeah.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.863
What about you? Where are you from?

37:36.906 --> 37:39.387
Actually, I was born in Korea.

37:39.431 --> 37:40.519
Yeah.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.521
When did you move here?

37:42.564 --> 37:45.306
I moved when I was seven.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.786
Yeah, I learned my English

37:46.829 --> 37:49.354
watching John Hughes films
when I was seven.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.617
That's why I talk
like a permanent teenager.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.271
That's how I learned to--

37:53.314 --> 37:54.881
- That's so amazing.
- That's why I have this permanent,

37:54.924 --> 37:56.404
like, valley girl accent.

37:56.448 --> 37:59.059
I speak like Molly Ringwald, basically.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.713
- Oh, my God, I love that.
- She created me.

38:00.756 --> 38:03.324
That's so awesome.
You know how I learned English?

38:03.368 --> 38:05.239
- How, what?
- Watching "Friends."

38:05.283 --> 38:08.764
- No, that's even worse!
- I know.

38:08.808 --> 38:13.073
Between the two of us,
we're speaking Pop Americana.

38:13.116 --> 38:16.206
# Trying to get to know you. #

38:16.250 --> 38:19.558
Ah-ah, oh.

38:21.124 --> 38:22.952
Sorry, I知 so weird.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.955
You're funny.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.001
- Um...
- Have you been back since?

38:28.044 --> 38:30.569
Yeah, I致e been back,
but I still wouldn't,

38:30.612 --> 38:33.006
like, identify myself with,
like, being Korean.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.747
You know, it's funny, this immigrant life

38:34.790 --> 38:36.314
'cause you're not, like, fully a Korean

38:36.357 --> 38:37.750
and you're not fully American,

38:37.793 --> 38:40.448
so you're this hyphenated American.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.145
So, what do you do here?

38:42.189 --> 38:43.886
I知 a photographer.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.410
Mm.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.803
I致e been photographing since I was 16.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.414
Yeah.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.372
When I came to America,
I realized there wasn't--

38:51.416 --> 38:54.027
There weren't that many pictures of me
growing up,

38:54.070 --> 38:56.029
and so I think I became a photographer

38:56.072 --> 38:59.685
because it was my own way
of cataloguing my life,

38:59.728 --> 39:01.948
you know, and archiving myself.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.646
Great job. I mean, I get it.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.692
- Thank you.
- I think that's beautiful.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.824
I致e never heard--
you know, it's true.

39:08.868 --> 39:10.652
I think...

39:10.696 --> 39:13.089
It's like "I was here," right?

40:26.989 --> 40:28.469
Come with me.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.950
It's kind of like appropriating identity

40:30.993 --> 40:33.909
and, I don't know, I love it.

40:41.395 --> 40:42.440
The Earth Mother

40:42.483 --> 40:44.964
catches her children

40:45.007 --> 40:46.531
in the net,

40:46.574 --> 40:48.141
and they fly away.

40:49.534 --> 40:52.058
Shh.

40:52.101 --> 40:55.104
Your--
feet is tied with a rock

40:55.148 --> 40:57.324
and you're on the ocean.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.282
You're trying to, like, swim upstream

40:59.326 --> 41:02.285
and it just keeps pulling you down,
you know.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.461
It's like...

41:08.596 --> 41:10.946
It's, like, so good.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.732
So consistent. Huh.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.039
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.084
Hey, darling.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.740
- Hi.
- Thank you for having us.

41:29.574 --> 41:32.141
I know.
So this is all I based on the harvest.

41:32.185 --> 41:35.318
Wow. Installation.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.278
Which one are you? Are you gentle,

41:38.321 --> 41:39.845
or are you a monster?

41:39.888 --> 41:41.281
That's Gary Vaseman, everyone.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.892
- Hello, Gary Vaseman.
- Hi, Gary Vaseman.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.720
Hey, Theodore. Hey.

41:45.764 --> 41:48.375
# When they fight, they fight #

41:50.072 --> 41:53.511
# And when they come home at night,
they say #

41:56.470 --> 41:58.994
# I love you, baby #

42:01.780 --> 42:05.044
# Ooh, ooh-ooh #

42:05.087 --> 42:09.614
# Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh #

42:09.657 --> 42:13.182
# Ooh, ooh-ooh #

42:13.226 --> 42:18.492
# Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh #

42:18.536 --> 42:22.191
# Was it too much too soon? #

42:22.235 --> 42:25.978
# Or too little too late, babe? #

42:26.021 --> 42:28.850
# He got the message
you left on his car #

42:28.894 --> 42:30.635
# In the rain #

42:34.464 --> 42:38.381
# And then the words, they come to you #

42:38.425 --> 42:42.908
# Driving away... #

42:42.951 --> 42:45.853
I think it's so important
for us to remember to, like,

42:46.053 --> 42:47.477
thank ourselves, you know?

42:47.521 --> 42:49.567
'Cause sometimes we--

42:49.610 --> 42:53.353
Yeah, that's the part
that I need some help with.

42:53.396 --> 42:56.530
'Cause I don't have balance in my life.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.141
Self-help books, Eckhart Tolle,

42:59.185 --> 43:01.883
Dr. Wayne Dyer, Oprah.

43:01.927 --> 43:03.711
No, do you read a lot?

43:03.755 --> 43:04.799
- Got you. I got you.
- No.

43:04.843 --> 43:05.974
Are you serious?

43:06.018 --> 43:07.497
What are some of the, like--

43:07.541 --> 43:09.195
What would be, like, the...

43:09.238 --> 43:11.893
God, you make me sound
like I知 some kind of guru.

43:11.937 --> 43:13.329
I don't know. I don't have any advice.

43:13.373 --> 43:15.070
I don't know, you seem so balanced.

43:18.683 --> 43:22.512
There's, like, a really beautiful,
like, quality about you.

43:22.556 --> 43:25.254
You're just so, like,
grounded and earthy.

43:25.298 --> 43:28.997
I like your vibe, too. I feel like
you're close to mine in that way, too.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.564
- You know?
- Really?

43:30.608 --> 43:33.001
- Totally. I do.
- You like my vibe?

43:33.045 --> 43:36.439
I think that's probably why the universe
keeps making us run into each other

43:36.483 --> 43:38.311
- in this big-ass fucking town.
- I know.

43:38.354 --> 43:41.575
Like, to see you again is like, whoa.

43:41.619 --> 43:45.710
I just--
I feel, like, so, I don't know...

43:45.753 --> 43:46.798
calm.

43:46.841 --> 43:49.104
Aw.

43:49.148 --> 43:51.106
- Good. I知 glad.
- Yeah?

43:51.150 --> 43:53.674
I love this so much. This is so nice.

44:02.770 --> 44:05.555
I didn't realize I was gonna
be modeling today.

44:05.599 --> 44:07.166
I would've, uh...

44:07.209 --> 44:08.428
Like that, hold it, hold it.

44:08.471 --> 44:09.995
- Yes.
- ...gotten in shape.

44:10.038 --> 44:12.127
You're the perfect subject for this.

44:12.171 --> 44:15.391
No, you should be in pictures.
You look fantastic.

44:15.435 --> 44:18.133
Do you always wear that outfit
when you take photos?

44:18.177 --> 44:19.700
- Yes.
- 'Cause I think you should.

44:19.744 --> 44:21.354
This is my studio.
I can wear whatever the fuck I want.

44:21.397 --> 44:22.572
You look amazing.

44:22.616 --> 44:24.052
- Shake it off.
- Okay.

44:24.096 --> 44:26.054
- Shake your head.
- Shake it off.

44:26.098 --> 44:29.710
- Okay, you got this.
- # Shake it off, shake it off #

44:29.754 --> 44:31.103
And now we can do a breathe.

44:31.146 --> 44:33.235
Like one breath.

44:36.151 --> 44:37.805
Oh, my God.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.589
Sophia.

44:39.633 --> 44:42.114
You fucking killed it.

44:42.157 --> 44:44.769
- You're so good.
- I didn't do anything.

44:44.812 --> 44:46.335
Tell me about this work.

44:46.379 --> 44:49.643
What--
What inspires you?

44:49.687 --> 44:52.385
I don't know.
I try to create a space

44:52.428 --> 44:54.517
for-- in my work--
where women can come.

44:54.561 --> 44:58.478
It's a space where it's, like,
nurturing and truthful,

44:58.521 --> 45:00.959
where they can really sort of, like,
be themselves

45:01.002 --> 45:03.222
so I can really capture their essence.

45:03.265 --> 45:05.572
Yeah, but, you know,
your work is so personal

45:05.615 --> 45:08.706
that all of these pictures
of these women,

45:08.749 --> 45:10.882
they actually all remind me of you.

45:10.925 --> 45:13.362
That's what I find so liberating
about you.

45:13.406 --> 45:16.626
You're just so free and I知 so analytical

45:16.670 --> 45:18.019
and I知 always, like, over-thinking

45:18.063 --> 45:20.500
and I have, like, my inner critic. Blah.

45:20.543 --> 45:23.242
And you're just--
I don't know, you're so free.

45:23.285 --> 45:25.723
I think all women should feel free.

45:25.766 --> 45:28.769
You know, this is--
our body--

45:28.813 --> 45:30.815
Our bodies are our vessel.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.947
It's how we move through the world,

45:32.991 --> 45:36.690
and it's sad that society's
made us ashamed of our bodies.

45:36.734 --> 45:40.433
- You're not ashamed.
- Fuck no, bitch.

45:40.476 --> 45:43.088
You're not ashamed of a thing.

45:43.131 --> 45:44.872
With all my flaws.

45:44.916 --> 45:47.614
I知 just gonna scrub
the fuck out of my skin

45:47.657 --> 45:50.051
till I get all these dead cells out.

45:50.095 --> 45:52.619
What are your parents like?

45:52.662 --> 45:54.795
Oh, lovely.

45:54.839 --> 45:58.059
- Are they pretty, like, understanding?
- They're African parents.

45:58.103 --> 46:02.890
So imagine your Korean parents.
How are they?

46:02.934 --> 46:06.415
Oh, my mom--
They're all, like, my inner critic.

46:06.459 --> 46:08.026
I don't need an inner critic

46:08.069 --> 46:10.463
'cause I just have my mom's voice like,

46:10.506 --> 46:13.771
"You're not good enough.
This is not good enough."

46:13.814 --> 46:16.512
- What about you?
- Oh, you're so sad.

46:16.556 --> 46:18.079
Well, what I hear from my mom is like,

46:18.123 --> 46:19.820
"You should get a real job.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.866
You should get a husband.
You should settle down."

46:21.909 --> 46:24.129
She doesn't like you doing pictures?

46:24.172 --> 46:27.219
No, she doesn't understand it.

46:27.262 --> 46:30.613
But it's okay. I think our parents,
especially our mothers,

46:30.657 --> 46:32.615
they didn't have
the freedom that we have.

46:32.659 --> 46:36.750
as the modern woman,
we get to have children later on.

46:36.794 --> 46:41.320
That's what I try to do in this work,

46:41.363 --> 46:42.843
but, actually, speaking of work,

46:42.887 --> 46:45.280
I知 actually going to New York next week.

46:45.324 --> 46:48.022
New York City.

46:48.066 --> 46:49.197
Cheers.

46:49.241 --> 46:52.984
- Cheers, salud.
- Salud.

46:57.902 --> 47:00.469
Why do you think Koreans were targeted?

47:00.513 --> 47:02.820
Oh, it's very hard to say.

47:05.779 --> 47:07.563
It's not just one thing

47:07.607 --> 47:10.828
that leads to an event like this.

47:13.613 --> 47:15.920
Creating ready-made racial tensions.

47:18.487 --> 47:20.968
Economic recession. Globalization.

47:23.710 --> 47:25.755
They're the new pioneers.

48:20.723 --> 48:24.075
Hey, Victoria. It's Sophia.

48:24.118 --> 48:26.686
I just woke up.

48:26.729 --> 48:28.035
I think it's like--

48:28.079 --> 48:31.299
I don't know, like, noon over there.

48:31.343 --> 48:34.737
I just wanted to say hi. I miss you.

48:34.781 --> 48:36.914
I can't wait till you're back.

49:04.028 --> 49:08.249
Hey, Victoria. It's Sophia.

49:08.293 --> 49:10.469
I left you a message
a couple of days ago.

49:10.512 --> 49:13.037
I just wanted to make sure
that you got it.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.517
And if not,
I was kind of groggy when I left it.

49:15.561 --> 49:17.911
Anyways,
I just wanted to hear your voice.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.957
I wanna know how New York is.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.307
I don't know.
I知 just curious about what you're up to.

49:22.350 --> 49:25.179
So just give me a call or text me.

49:25.223 --> 49:27.181
Yeah, let me know you're okay.

49:27.225 --> 49:29.227
Okay, bye.

49:51.466 --> 49:53.338
Now, is it the same photographs?

49:53.381 --> 49:55.209
Is this one of signs?

49:55.253 --> 49:56.645
'Cause I know about signs.

49:56.689 --> 49:57.951
I know you know signs.

49:57.995 --> 49:59.083
You bought three of them.

49:59.126 --> 50:00.475
You bought three of my photos.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.086
Well, I was also born under one.

50:02.129 --> 50:04.305
I was born under the Hollywood sign,

50:04.349 --> 50:07.787
right under the letters L and Y.

50:07.830 --> 50:09.136
- Wow.
- Yeah, literally.

50:09.180 --> 50:10.485
- Hollywood baby.
- Hollywood baby.

50:10.529 --> 50:12.183
What are you doing in New York?

50:12.226 --> 50:15.055
Whether it's art or filmmaking,
you come to New York.

50:15.099 --> 50:17.492
You come to New York to show your work.

50:17.536 --> 50:19.190
So I know about that.

50:19.233 --> 50:21.061
And that's why you're here.

50:21.105 --> 50:25.761
You're here. What other places
have you shown your work at?

50:25.805 --> 50:28.068
Dusseldorf? Paris?

50:28.112 --> 50:29.374
Okay, okay.

50:29.417 --> 50:31.376
I think that the most--

50:31.419 --> 50:33.552
You may have some
of the most important work you've done.

50:33.595 --> 50:35.902
Sharon has to get picked up

50:35.945 --> 50:39.819
by a certain person who has demands

50:39.862 --> 50:43.475
that she show up at her house.

50:43.518 --> 50:46.130
Yeah, we're gonna go eat.
We should go eat dinner at Botanica.

50:46.173 --> 50:47.348
I heard it's really good.

50:47.392 --> 50:49.220
I heard it's really cute inside.

50:49.263 --> 50:51.439
- Oh, I can't--
- Should I just uber to her house?

50:51.483 --> 50:53.093
She buys less stuff.

50:53.137 --> 50:56.096
So laying her off,
Nordstrom is making less money

50:56.140 --> 50:59.012
'cause she's, like, not shopping as much.

51:00.666 --> 51:02.233
Yeah, she doesn't need to get a job.

51:02.276 --> 51:05.584
She still goes to Nordstrom
like every other day.

51:39.183 --> 51:41.359
Are you okay?

51:49.236 --> 51:50.846
What's wrong?

51:52.196 --> 51:54.807
Sorry, I gotta--
I gotta take this off.

51:54.850 --> 51:56.722
I gotta--
Can I take this off?

51:56.765 --> 51:58.898
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.102
I felt like she really got me,

52:29.146 --> 52:31.017
and I, like, understood her.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.714
It was--
You know, I just feel like,

52:32.758 --> 52:34.194
maybe I shouldn't be so open

52:34.238 --> 52:35.717
because every time I知 open,

52:35.761 --> 52:37.154
I just get my heart broken,

52:37.197 --> 52:38.894
and I feel like such a fool.

52:38.938 --> 52:42.507
What do you think would help you move
from this place?

52:42.550 --> 52:47.903
I don't know. Like validation for my work
would be amazing.

52:47.947 --> 52:49.209
Yeah.

52:49.253 --> 52:52.256
Maybe and that has to do with money.

52:52.299 --> 52:54.301
I don't even know what I知 thinking,
actually.

52:54.345 --> 52:56.869
I just--
I miss her so much

52:56.912 --> 53:01.003
and I知 just really so stupid.

53:01.047 --> 53:02.527
Oh, no.

53:02.570 --> 53:06.357
So how about we take a moment

53:06.400 --> 53:09.490
and just not think about this
for a second,

53:09.534 --> 53:14.495
but I just have to get
to the task rabbit job

53:14.539 --> 53:16.541
that I had you come over to do,

53:16.584 --> 53:19.326
because I知 getting charged, and I just--

53:19.370 --> 53:21.676
I hope maybe this will help you
a little bit

53:21.720 --> 53:24.244
- 'cause the shed is a mess...
- Oh, my God, yes, of course.

53:24.288 --> 53:27.247
so I really need your help today.

53:27.291 --> 53:28.901
Just take care of that.

53:28.944 --> 53:30.555
Of course. No, I知 here for you.

53:30.598 --> 53:32.992
Okay. All right.

53:33.035 --> 53:34.559
- No, I知 sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

53:34.602 --> 53:36.517
- What is it that you--
- It's right back here.

53:36.561 --> 53:39.868
- Sorry.
- That's okay. That's okay.

53:51.706 --> 53:53.795
You think it might be a good idea?

53:53.839 --> 53:55.362
- To tell her that I have a boyfriend?
- Mm-hm.

53:55.406 --> 53:58.060
You're my man.
You have nothing to worry about.

53:58.104 --> 54:02.891
So, I mean,
are you kinda into her at all?

54:02.935 --> 54:05.459
- No.
- No? Not even a little bit?

54:05.503 --> 54:08.854
Holy shit.

54:08.897 --> 54:10.899
Who's this?

54:12.249 --> 54:13.250
Fuck.

54:15.034 --> 54:17.471
- What the fuck?
- I thought you were back in town.

54:17.515 --> 54:19.952
Why haven't you returned any of my texts?

54:19.995 --> 54:21.780
I went out of town and I知 just--

54:21.823 --> 54:23.608
I know, but you could've texted me back,

54:23.651 --> 54:25.697
like,
to just tell me that you were alive.

54:25.740 --> 54:27.916
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, you're my friend.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.223
- We had a really nice time.
- Are you mad at me?

54:30.267 --> 54:31.877
- I知 not mad at you.
- Did something happen?

54:31.920 --> 54:33.705
- I知 just trying to do my life.
- No, I know.

54:33.748 --> 54:38.536
I thought we had something, or am I--

54:38.579 --> 54:40.015
- I知 sorry.
- That's my boyfriend.

54:40.059 --> 54:43.932
He's my friend--
my boyfriend.

54:43.976 --> 54:47.588
You have a boyfriend?

54:47.632 --> 54:50.765
Victoria,
don't make me look like an idiot.

54:50.809 --> 54:52.506
- I mean--
- We had a nice time.

54:52.550 --> 54:54.116
- It was great.
- No, I know.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.335
- What the fuck?
- I知 just-- I知 sorry.

54:55.379 --> 54:57.381
Like, "What the fuck"?

54:57.424 --> 54:59.034
What the fuck? You what the fuck!

54:59.078 --> 55:00.949
- You have a boyfriend.
- Hey, what's going on?

55:00.993 --> 55:02.995
- Listen, dude, I知 not talking to you.
- Baby, don't...

55:03.038 --> 55:04.562
- Can you just step away?
- That's cool.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.868
I知 talking to her.
I知 talking to Victoria.

55:06.912 --> 55:08.435
Can you just step away?

55:08.479 --> 55:10.132
You just seem really intense right now.

55:10.176 --> 55:11.699
Will you fucking get rid of him?

55:11.743 --> 55:13.527
You're making me feel like such an idiot.

55:13.571 --> 55:17.052
What? This is too much for me,
this constant texting.

55:17.096 --> 55:19.185
And Facebook and fucking Instagram.

55:19.228 --> 55:21.274
Do you think I would've pursued you

55:21.318 --> 55:22.841
- if I thought you had a boyfriend?
- Pursued?

55:22.884 --> 55:24.190
- I知 not an idiot.
- You're my friend.

55:24.233 --> 55:25.670
You know you're not just my friend.

55:25.713 --> 55:27.541
You're fucking being so crazy right now.

55:27.585 --> 55:29.761
- Just chill. You're my friend.
- Get away from me. Just--

55:29.804 --> 55:31.284
Don't fucking touch him.

55:31.328 --> 55:34.113
Don't touch him. What are you--
Oh, my God!

55:34.156 --> 55:37.159
What the fuck are you--
Hey!

55:37.203 --> 55:38.160
Fuck you!

55:38.204 --> 55:39.901
Okay, stand the fuck back.

55:39.945 --> 55:42.295
- You're fucking crazy.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.690
Fuck you.

55:45.733 --> 55:48.954
Fuck you. Fuck! What the fuck?

55:52.697 --> 55:54.394
- Fuck you.
- You bit him.

55:54.438 --> 55:55.787
- Fuck you.
- You bit him.

55:55.830 --> 55:57.441
You guys are parasites of the earth.

55:57.484 --> 55:59.181
Fuck--
Fuck off.

55:59.225 --> 56:00.879
Is this, like, hilarious--

56:00.922 --> 56:02.794
Fuck off, Victoria, you two-timing cunt.

56:02.837 --> 56:06.841
You fucking bitch! Fuck.

56:06.885 --> 56:08.843
Fuck you!

56:26.600 --> 56:29.211
It's my fucking coffee.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.689
Umma.

58:38.732 --> 58:42.736
Sophia, so glad to talk to you.

58:42.780 --> 58:46.740
I haven't heard from you for a while.

58:46.784 --> 58:49.526
- Uma.
- Hm?

58:49.569 --> 58:50.744
What is it?

58:52.703 --> 58:56.794
I don't know what I知 doing.
I知 just wasting my life.

58:56.837 --> 58:59.187
Did you break up with a boyfriend
or something?

58:59.231 --> 59:00.537
What's going on?

59:02.364 --> 59:05.759
Huh? Did somebody...

59:06.804 --> 59:08.153
...break your heart?

59:09.502 --> 59:11.635
You're doing a great job,

59:11.678 --> 59:14.246
and I am right because I知 your mother.

59:14.289 --> 59:16.553
No, I知 not.

59:16.596 --> 59:20.818
You are always talented
in your paintings, in your sculptures.

59:20.861 --> 59:23.777
You're an artist.

59:23.821 --> 59:27.694
Uma, I don't make sculptures.

59:27.738 --> 59:29.740
What do you mean,
you don't make sculptures?

59:29.783 --> 59:32.612
I make things that you can't sell.

59:32.656 --> 59:36.747
I make things that you can't sell, Uma.

59:36.790 --> 59:39.271
Then who are you making it for,

59:39.314 --> 59:42.230
whatever you're making?

59:42.274 --> 59:45.712
I don't know.

59:45.756 --> 59:47.627
It's okay.

59:47.671 --> 59:51.196
Somebody someday
is going to appreciate what you're making

59:51.239 --> 59:53.459
even though you're not selling it.

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:01.685
You worked so hard

01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:05.166
and you always had
so many more obstacles than me,

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.472
you and dad,

01:00:06.515 --> 01:00:09.388
and I just--
I wanna thank you

01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:12.217
and I wanna thank you
for always supporting me

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:18.223
no matter what crazy,
crazy stuff I wanted to do.

01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.225
Just, thank you so much.

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:22.793
And I知 going to be a little bit busy

01:00:22.836 --> 01:00:25.404
so I won't be able to call you, okay?

01:00:25.447 --> 01:00:27.667
But don't worry.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.148
Remember to take care of yourself.

01:00:30.191 --> 01:00:33.238
- I will.
- Crazy stuff but take care of yourself.

01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:37.024
- Okay, I will.
- And eat.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:39.679
Bye. I love you.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:42.639
- Bye, Uma.
- Bye bye.

01:01:02.484 --> 01:01:07.272
I know that saying I overreacted

01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:10.492
is an understatement.

01:01:10.536 --> 01:01:13.495
We had such fun together, right?

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:21.852
And I think
I did kind of misconstrue or--

01:01:21.895 --> 01:01:23.462
I don't know.

01:01:23.505 --> 01:01:26.421
I feel like every time
I come across something

01:01:26.465 --> 01:01:29.337
that I start to really love,

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:31.513
I just--
I wanna hold onto it

01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:33.211
and make it mine or...

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:34.473
I just wanna grasp it

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:36.954
because I already worry about losing it.

01:01:36.997 --> 01:01:41.175
I have a lot of Han.
Do you know what that is?

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:44.439
- No.
- It's like Koreans have a lot of Han.

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:47.051
We have a lot of inner demons,

01:01:47.094 --> 01:01:49.140
a lot of inner anger

01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:51.142
that's just ready to come out.

01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:53.927
- Anyway...
- I left just for a week.

01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:57.148
I was gone only a week,
and you were just, like...

01:01:57.191 --> 01:02:00.586
not getting the hint.

01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:03.545
I知 sorry that I bit your boyfriend.

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:06.461
Yeah, I知 sorry, too.

01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:10.204
And I知 sorry
that I misread all the signals.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:12.641
I think I just got really excited

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:18.082
because
a lot of my friends that I致e had,

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:20.606
they sort of turn this other path

01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:22.086
that I don't really recognize.

01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:24.653
You know, it's really hard

01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:26.394
to make new friends

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:27.656
as adults,

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.789
and I just instantly

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:33.793
just--
I, like, loved you.

01:02:33.837 --> 01:02:36.187
That was rad. That was connection, right?

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.929
Yeah. That was great. We had so much fun.

01:02:38.972 --> 01:02:40.626
Yeah.

01:02:40.669 --> 01:02:43.498
You know that Osho quote...

01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.370
about love?

01:02:45.413 --> 01:02:49.896
If you love a flower, you don't pick it.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.550
That's how you know love.

01:02:57.686 --> 01:02:59.601
Anyway, it's all good.

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:07.131
I won't pick your flower.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.092
Yeah, don't pick my flower.

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:13.920
Just let me bloom, girl.

01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:23.712
Over 100,000 people showed

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:26.803
in the march for peace.

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:28.065
Unity and support

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:32.809
from all over Southern California.

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:35.724
It is here that we attracted
the mainstream media

01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:39.163
of our plight.

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.905
We had been victims of injustice.

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:47.867
And that we want peace.

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:53.830
We want to live in harmony
with our neighbors.

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:58.269
And we want peace.

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:07.104
Can you hear me?

01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:14.372
Can you hear me?

01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:24.599
Can you hear me, oh, beach?

01:04:27.776 --> 01:04:31.171
Can you hear me, oh, beach?

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.839
# She was a shark smile #

01:06:57.883 --> 01:07:00.016
# In a yellow van #

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:04.498
# She came around
and I stole a glance in my youth #

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:05.934
# A vampire #

01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:10.678
# Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting #

01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:14.508
# It came over me at a bad time #

01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:17.946
# But who wouldn't ride
on a moonlit line? #

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:20.949
# Had her in my eye #

01:07:20.993 --> 01:07:24.779
# 85 down the road of a dead end gleam #

01:07:24.823 --> 01:07:27.173
# And she said woo #

01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:31.873
# Baby, take me #

01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:34.441
# And I said woo #

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:37.923
# Baby, take me too #

01:07:39.664 --> 01:07:43.929
# It came over her at a bad time #

01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:48.020
# Riding through Winona
down the dotted line #

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.848
# Held us gunning out #

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:54.200
# Ninety miles down the road
of a dead end dream #

01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:58.378
# She looked over with a part smile #

01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:02.774
# Caught up in the twinkle,
it could take a while #

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:08.519
# And the money pile
on the dashboard fluttering #

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:11.130
# As she said woo #

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:14.177
# Baby, take me #

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.136
# And I said woo #

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.618
# Baby, take me too #

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:42.205
# Evelyn痴 kiss was oxygen #

01:08:42.247 --> 01:08:46.600
# I leaned over to take it in #

01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:48.559
# As we went howling #

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:52.737
# Through the edge of South Des Moines #

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:56.783
# It came over me at a bad time #

01:08:56.828 --> 01:09:01.354
# She burned over the double line #

01:09:01.398 --> 01:09:03.703
# And she impaled #

01:09:03.747 --> 01:09:08.535
# As I reached my hand
for the guardrail #

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:11.930
# Ooh, the guardrail #

01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:15.934
# Ooh, the guardrail #

01:09:17.022 --> 01:09:19.416
# And she said woo #

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:24.116
# Baby, take me #

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.901
# And I said woo #

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:31.558
# Baby, take me too #

01:09:31.602 --> 01:09:34.256
# She said woo #

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.912
# Baby, take me #

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:41.481
# And I said woo #

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:45.050
# Baby, take me too #

01:09:46.305 --> 01:09:52.732
