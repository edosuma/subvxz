00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:30.321 --> 00:35.118
I'm at the location, but I don't see
anything except for snow and… steam?

00:35.869 --> 00:40.081
Oh no, man. I think the heat
in my spy suit's turned on too high.

00:40.165 --> 00:40.999
Hold on.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.584
Uh, let me see.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.005
Oh, okay. That just made it hotter.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.467
It's like a sauna! In a swamp!

00:51.342 --> 00:52.802
On the sun!

00:56.639 --> 00:58.183
<i>Cisco, enough playing around.</i>

00:58.266 --> 01:01.019
<i>Stay focused on finding</i>
<i>the rogue nuclear warheads out there.</i>

01:01.603 --> 01:04.189
I'm not playing. This suit's tricky.

01:05.023 --> 01:08.943
Also, how do you, you know, like,
do what you got to do in this thing?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.445
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:10.528 --> 01:15.992
I'm saying, if I'm in this suit,
and I have to, you know…

01:16.076 --> 01:17.952
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:18.036 --> 01:21.039
Pee! What do I got to do if I got to pee?

01:21.581 --> 01:24.876
Is it like a wetsuit, where you just,
you know, let things happen?

01:24.959 --> 01:26.669
<i>You pee in your wetsuit?</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:27.587
No!

01:28.463 --> 01:30.131
<i>Sounds like you pee in your wetsuit.</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:31.633
-Incoming.

01:31.716 --> 01:35.136
-This will have to be continued.
-<i>You want to keep talking about it?</i>

01:44.062 --> 01:45.605
Phew. Aw!

01:45.688 --> 01:47.440
They're like little snowmen.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.360
Okay, bad snowmen!

01:55.949 --> 01:59.202
Okay, I think I'm in the right spot.
Now, come and help me!

01:59.285 --> 02:01.955
-Hey, we're on our way.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.965
They're closing in!

02:12.549 --> 02:13.383
Good.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.107
Okay, that's dope.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.630
-Glad we could help.
-We're getting close.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.091
Now!

03:07.562 --> 03:10.106
Aw man, they're poking holes in my truck.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.400
<i>Did they hit a gas line? Is it gonna blow?</i>

03:12.483 --> 03:14.152
No, but they're letting the cold in!

03:14.235 --> 03:16.738
Guess I'll just have to turn up the heat.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.788
Now the pulled has become the puller!

03:25.872 --> 03:27.707
<i>I have no idea what you're saying.</i>

03:31.544 --> 03:34.839
Aw, man. More bad snow dudes.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.427
Alright! Good snow dudes!

03:45.600 --> 03:47.227
Yeah! How do you like that?

03:47.810 --> 03:49.938
Guys, I think we found the rockets.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.440
Yup! There they are.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.692
You got five minutes to stop the launch.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.451
We could use a little help.

04:03.534 --> 04:04.410
I'm on my way.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.120
Everyone, make some room!

04:15.046 --> 04:16.464
Good job, Frostee.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.425
<i>Now get out there and stop</i>
<i>those nuclear weapons from launching</i>

04:19.509 --> 04:20.927
<i>and taking out half the world.</i>

04:21.511 --> 04:24.264
Just another day at the office.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.146
<i>Step one:</i>

04:32.230 --> 04:35.149
<i>use the palm print on your spy suit</i>
<i>to open the control panel.</i>

04:35.233 --> 04:36.818
<i>This should be a walk in the park.</i>

04:40.822 --> 04:42.865
Uh, my park's not walking.

04:42.949 --> 04:43.908
What's happening?

04:43.992 --> 04:46.536
I seem to have sprung a leak.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.495
What?

04:47.578 --> 04:50.623
I'm sweaty, okay?
It's the suit. It's too hot.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.292
What about your hand deodorant?

04:52.375 --> 04:56.587
I ran out. I tried to use regular
armpit deodorant but it's not the same.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.591
Sure. We've got three minutes until
the end of civilization as we know it,

05:00.675 --> 05:03.511
so let's chat about deodorants!

05:04.679 --> 05:06.848
I thought it was
an interesting conversation.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.100
-I go all natural.
-Zip it, Gary!

05:14.355 --> 05:15.315
Okay, I'm in.

05:15.398 --> 05:19.652
<i>Next, you have to enter</i>
<i>the individualized 22-digit code</i>

05:19.736 --> 05:21.821
<i>that you're all</i>
<i>supposed to have memorized.</i>

05:21.904 --> 05:23.531
Oh, no. I forgot the code.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.074
The entire thing?

05:25.158 --> 05:28.619
No, just the last number. Or maybe
I mixed it up with the first number?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.371
How do you forget the first number?

05:30.455 --> 05:31.706
I don't know!

05:31.789 --> 05:35.585
I'm under a lot of pressure, okay, and
my brain doesn't work good under pressure.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.254
Did you say "work good"?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.134
Great! Now there's more of those guys.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.595
<i>Focus on the rockets.</i>
<i>I'm sending help.</i>

05:49.015 --> 05:50.600
Just like we practiced.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.944
Sorry! Couldn't resist.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.165
Sir, I'm gonna need to
commandeer this vehicle.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.293
Whoops! Mistimed that one.

06:25.635 --> 06:29.305
Wait, I got it! It's three!
How could I forget my favorite number?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.393
Wait, you have a favorite number?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.813
You know what? Never mind.
Of course you do.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.273
First, ID the infrared signal lines.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.817
The red laser thingies.

06:44.278 --> 06:47.115
Now, reroute the detonator
to the decoy motherboard.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.909
Put the little drive thingy
into the slot opening thingy.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.412
Now, to stop the launch sequence,

06:53.496 --> 06:57.917
you need to bypass the main CPU
by cutting the red wire.

06:58.626 --> 07:02.046
I don't see any red wire.
I only have blue and green here.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.048
-<i>Uh, me too.</i>
-<i>Same.</i>

07:04.132 --> 07:05.758
<i>Someone make the call!</i>

07:05.842 --> 07:09.846
I don't know. It's one or the other
and you only have five seconds.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.726
Uh, blue! We're going blue.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.777
Good thing
I knew what to do with that wire.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.281
-<i>What is that?</i>

07:28.364 --> 07:31.909
A sixth rocket!
Why is there always a sixth rocket?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.537
Ms. Nowhere? We got a problem.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.291
I'm working on it. It looks like
there's a control station under the ice.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.793
<i>Someone needs to go there.</i>

07:40.877 --> 07:42.253
I got this.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.560
I'm almost there!

08:05.276 --> 08:09.030
I could hack in
and reroute the rocket, or…

08:14.660 --> 08:16.662
Yeah!

08:16.746 --> 08:17.955
Woohoo!

08:18.039 --> 08:22.043
Yeah, boy! We did it!

08:22.668 --> 08:25.505
Unless there's a seventh rocket…

08:28.841 --> 08:30.259
-Huh?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.053
-Uh…

08:36.974 --> 08:40.520
What's going on? Did it work?

08:42.230 --> 08:45.733
Okay, team. Time to debrief.
What went right with that mission,

08:45.816 --> 08:48.486
what went wrong,
and what went really wrong?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.613
Nothing went really wrong.
We saved the day.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.699
Well, that's not how I see it. Gary!

08:53.783 --> 08:57.203
Uh… Tony forgot the code,
Cisco had sweaty hands,

08:57.286 --> 08:59.163
Ms. Nowhere gave the wrong wire color.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.500
Oh, interesting! So you messed up too?

09:02.583 --> 09:05.044
That wire thing?

09:05.127 --> 09:08.631
Pretty sure that was
somehow Julius's fault.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.092
I think he's colorblind.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.218
I am?!

09:13.261 --> 09:16.013
Ms. Nowhere, can we
please not do this right now?

09:16.097 --> 09:18.933
I don't know what's going on,
but ever since I left the Arctic,

09:19.016 --> 09:20.184
I'm feeling unsettled.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.687
I think I pulled a muscle in my neck.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.522
Ow! Yup, there it is.

09:24.605 --> 09:29.360
Yeah, I've been feeling weird too.
It's like… Like I'm all twitchy.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.237
I mean, look at my eye.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.949
-I haven't been able to focus.
-And I've been having some weird dreams.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.494
There's this one, where
Gary's human face was on a teddy bear,

09:38.578 --> 09:39.996
that was sitting on a shelf.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.415
He couldn't move, and he just kept saying,

09:42.498 --> 09:45.501
"Play patty-cake with me.
Play patty-cake with me."

09:46.294 --> 09:47.628
Well? Did you?

09:47.712 --> 09:49.755
No! You make a creepy teddy bear.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.216
-What is going on with us?
-I think I know.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.721
I've web-searched these symptoms before.
Everyone here is suffering from stress.

09:56.804 --> 09:57.763
Stress?!

09:57.847 --> 09:59.640
It's the silent killer!

09:59.724 --> 10:02.560
And it's attacking
my neck again right now.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.313
Oh, calm down. Stress is good.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.400
It's the fuel that makes
an agent's fire burn stronger.

10:09.483 --> 10:13.279
The sweaty armpits,
the heart palpitations…

10:13.362 --> 10:16.365
Makes you feel alive!

10:17.241 --> 10:20.703
Now, any guesses on what
Sudarikov's men were doing in the Arctic?

10:21.287 --> 10:25.875
Sudarikov is gone, so they must be
working for someone else, but who?

10:25.958 --> 10:26.792
And why?

10:26.876 --> 10:29.420
And when will they attack next?

10:29.503 --> 10:31.589
My boss is gonna want answers.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.507
Who is your boss, anyway?

10:33.591 --> 10:36.677
Does your boss have a boss?
How high up does it go?

10:36.761 --> 10:40.014
That's need-to-know information,
and you don't need to know.

10:40.598 --> 10:45.478
You just need to do,
as you're told, by me.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.272
You don't know who your boss is, do you?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.608
-I know enough.
-That's a no.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.194
Okay, Ms. Nowhere,
I think we need a break.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.530
Look, I know my team. If you push them
too hard, they'll just push back.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.408
Ms. Nowhere, I think
this is a good time to tell them.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.204
I thought we were gonna wait
until after the debrief.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.707
Can we do it now?
Pretty please, with a cherry on top!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.376
Fine!

11:08.459 --> 11:10.127
What are you three whispering about?

11:10.711 --> 11:13.631
We have a surprise for you all.
We're not headed back to LA.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.384
We're going to a special black site
in Eastern Europe,

11:16.467 --> 11:19.136
and when we're there,
we're gonna celebrate…

11:19.220 --> 11:21.680
Incineration Day!

11:23.265 --> 11:24.517
Uh, come again?

11:39.490 --> 11:40.866
-Cheer?
-No.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.247
Okay, seriously. What?

11:46.330 --> 11:50.042
Tomorrow night, we gather all the weapons
that we've apprehended from our enemies,

11:50.126 --> 11:53.629
including a few of our own experimental
weapons that have no practical uses,

11:53.712 --> 11:55.506
or are a little too dangerous to exist,

11:55.589 --> 11:58.134
and we take them out to the desert,
and we blow them up!

11:58.217 --> 11:59.468
It's awesome!

11:59.552 --> 12:02.096
And you're actually okay with this?

12:02.179 --> 12:06.475
Uh, of course!
Who doesn't love blowing stuff up?

12:06.976 --> 12:07.893
Gather round.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.438
We made a documentary
about Incineration Day.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.939
Julius, hit the lights.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.530
<i>I had just coaxed my goats</i>
<i>out of the argan trees and into their pen,</i>

12:19.613 --> 12:21.615
<i>when I heard a massive boom.</i>

12:23.409 --> 12:27.872
<i>I turned to see the night sky</i>
<i>a shade of green I had never seen before,</i>

12:27.955 --> 12:33.127
<i>and what looked like flaming toasters</i>
<i>descended all over the desert.</i>

12:33.711 --> 12:36.255
<i>Marshall Dean, Desert Farm Register.</i>

12:38.174 --> 12:40.342
<i>What Marshall Dean</i>
<i>saw that night</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:43.012
<i>was the first of an annual celebration</i>

12:43.095 --> 12:47.016
<i>that came to be known as Incineration Day.</i>

12:47.683 --> 12:53.147
<i>It would change forever the way</i>
<i>the world understood incineration, days,</i>

12:53.230 --> 12:56.192
<i>and the entire concept</i>
<i>of hazardous waste disposal.</i>

12:56.275 --> 12:59.445
<i>Incineration Day</i>
<i>was founded nine years ago,</i>

12:59.528 --> 13:04.700
<i>but to truly understand it, we must</i>
<i>go back to the dawn of creation itself.</i>

13:04.783 --> 13:08.454
How long is this thing?

13:08.537 --> 13:09.955
Just under six hours.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.208
Move! I'm scrubbing through.

13:13.375 --> 13:17.338
<i>Julius,</i>
<i>an avid whistler and Pog collector,</i>

13:17.421 --> 13:18.506
<i>and Gary,</i>

13:19.048 --> 13:22.510
<i>a former rodeo clown and beekeeper--</i>

13:22.593 --> 13:24.470
-Where's the good stuff?

13:24.553 --> 13:27.723
The fireballs, the lasers,
the burning feathers?

13:27.806 --> 13:31.185
That's in the "Best Of Incineration Day"
montage at the very end.

13:31.268 --> 13:34.188
But first, you gotta hear about
the traditional sweater swap.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.981
The decorating of the detonator.

13:36.065 --> 13:40.277
What about the traditional cheesecake
pyramid on Incineration Day Eve?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.655
-Okay. Here we go.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.162
Look how happy we were.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.209
So are you guys excited, or what?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.337
I do love blowing things up!

13:58.420 --> 14:02.216
And it sounds relaxing.
I can already feel my neck loosening up.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.760
Don't get me wrong,
I'm all about destruction parties,

14:04.843 --> 14:08.681
but you're telling us you store all of
your most dangerous tech in one location,

14:08.764 --> 14:11.100
just so you can blow it up
on a special day?

14:11.183 --> 14:13.936
-Sounds incompetent.
-Echo makes a good point.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.397
I'm surprised
the agency is okay with this.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.943
You may know your team, Toretto,
but I know the agency,

14:21.026 --> 14:23.362
and whatever risk this entails
is worth it.

14:23.445 --> 14:27.116
Besides, that gear is in
one of the most secure locations on Earth.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.828
It is under constant watch
by armed soldiers.

14:30.911 --> 14:35.040
No one, and I mean no one,
is getting to it.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.961
Oh, no. Someone got to it.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.674
What happened here?

14:43.757 --> 14:45.843
We're still trying to
assess the situation,

14:45.926 --> 14:48.929
but by the time we realized
we were being robbed, it was too late.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.140
What direction were they headed
when they left?

14:51.223 --> 14:54.685
East, through the desert. We checked
the satellites but couldn't locate them.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.271
-They must know our satellite footprint.
-What's that?

14:57.354 --> 14:59.481
Because of satellite trajectories,

14:59.565 --> 15:03.319
there are a few dark areas
where the spy satellites can't see.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.447
Whoever stole the supplies
must know about these areas.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.074
-Gary! My computer! Now!

15:12.411 --> 15:15.539
This map identifies
these zero-visibility areas.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.958
Whoever stole the weapons
must be on that road.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.420
Thank goodness
we can get the weapons back.

15:21.503 --> 15:25.716
The thought of not having Incineration Day
is… too much to bear.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.260
Right. Also, it might be good
that those crazy weapons

15:28.344 --> 15:30.054
aren't being released into the world.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.472
Yeah, that too.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.849
How do you plan on
catching up with the convoy?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.727
It's probably 100 miles from here by now.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.189
We have our ways.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.115
We're closing in on the convoy.
Ten miles away.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.284
Ms. Nowhere, we're almost to them.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.620
Might be kinda nice
to know what we're up against.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.080
What weapons did they steal?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.499
<i>I got the inventory list right here.</i>

15:58.582 --> 16:01.502
<i>There are a lot of strange explosives.</i>
<i>Let's see…</i>

16:01.585 --> 16:06.632
<i>We got a sneezinator,</i>
<i>a mood-confuser, a fear donut…</i>

16:07.216 --> 16:09.218
What?! A food weapon?

16:09.301 --> 16:12.471
No! We called it a donut
because it was filled with jelly,

16:12.554 --> 16:17.184
but unlike jelly, if it gets on you,
it makes you frightened of everything.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.894
<i>There's the Mucus Maker.</i>

16:18.978 --> 16:21.647
<i>That's a device that makes</i>
<i>your body create too much mucus.</i>

16:21.730 --> 16:25.275
<i>Sounds like it belongs on</i>
<i>an episode of </i>Voltron,<i> but it's real!</i>

16:25.359 --> 16:27.027
Why would anyone make those things?

16:27.111 --> 16:31.115
To win wars, confuse your enemies,
mess with your co-workers.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.367
You guys are making mood-swing bombs?

16:33.450 --> 16:35.828
I have so much to learn.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.623
There's also a portable version
of Cleve Kelso's weather machine in there.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.085
A bug whistle - don't know
what that does - a headache machine…

16:43.669 --> 16:44.837
<i>Haunting powder…</i>

16:44.920 --> 16:48.298
<i>Oh! Here's a crazy one. Laser contacts.</i>

16:49.591 --> 16:53.137
<i>In general, just avoid</i>
<i>any and all weapons, if possible.</i>

16:53.220 --> 16:55.764
<i>They're unpredictable, some are untested,</i>

16:55.848 --> 16:59.685
<i>and even the ones that work</i>
<i>definitely should not exist.</i>

17:00.394 --> 17:02.021
-Got it.
-I got a visual.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.702
They know we're here.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.767
Hey! Why am I all by myself?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.273
Nice driving, car.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.027
-Oh, no.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.363
Where is it?!

18:00.162 --> 18:04.208
Yeah! I'm awesome!

18:07.086 --> 18:08.837
Eh, you did good too.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.681
Echo, what do you want me to do?

18:19.765 --> 18:22.059
Just stay back. I got this.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.702
Nicely done, Echo!

18:45.457 --> 18:48.460
Yo, I don't think
we're gonna be able to stop these semis.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.630
<i>We don't need to stop them.</i>
<i>We just need to detach the trailers.</i>

18:51.713 --> 18:55.175
Layla's right. Let's get over there.
Frostee, hang back and cover us.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.260
I got you, T.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.439
Easy breezy, guys.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.774
We've done this before.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.280
Why do I even speak?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.997
It's okay, I'm okay.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.129
I'm okay.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.800
I'm okay!

19:38.760 --> 19:42.055
Oh, no. I think Tony's been hit
with that mood-swing bomb.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.058
It's not true, it can't be.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.731
Mood bomb! Weird.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.280
<i>Told you I got you.</i>

19:58.363 --> 20:00.449
-<i>Uh-oh. You're too heavy!</i>

20:20.719 --> 20:23.555
Oh, no. Clear jelly. It's the fear bomb!

20:28.435 --> 20:30.771
Hey, what's happening?
You two okay over there?

20:30.854 --> 20:33.315
Cisco got hit with the fear bomb, but,

20:33.398 --> 20:35.442
I think it's having a reverse effect.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.825
<i>Ha! I'm two for two.</i>

20:54.503 --> 20:56.922
-Whoa!

21:12.312 --> 21:14.648
Nothing can stop me!

21:21.446 --> 21:23.407
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

21:30.497 --> 21:32.291
Looks like my backup has arrived.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.835
I guess
I'll have to get rid of you both.

22:02.779 --> 22:06.742
Well, we can forget about
saving Incineration Day.

22:06.825 --> 22:11.246
-Looks like we got to save the world.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.107
