01:08.901 --> 01:11.234
Hey, you know, if we don't
get out of here soon,

01:11.268 --> 01:12.801
we're gonna miss
the first race.

01:12.834 --> 01:13.901
Don't worry about it.

01:13.934 --> 01:16.034
Hey, you hear anything
from John yet?

01:16.067 --> 01:18.134
What am I,
an information booth?

01:18.168 --> 01:19.367
I was just asking.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.300
I mean, He should
have been in by now.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.901
He should have been in?

01:22.934 --> 01:24.500
I should have been rich.

01:24.534 --> 01:26.901
You should have had
a better nose.

01:26.934 --> 01:28.101
Life is cruel.

01:28.134 --> 01:30.001
Hey, get away
from that cage, Bobby.

01:30.034 --> 01:31.934
We're not insured
if he breaks out.

01:33.433 --> 01:35.101
Okay, let's see,
in the fifth.

01:35.134 --> 01:36.234
( <i>phone rings</i> )

01:36.268 --> 01:38.667
Hey, if that's the gallery,
tell them I'm on my way.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.700
Oh, you guys are going
to the track, huh?

01:41.734 --> 01:42.700
Yes, we are.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.333
Alex picked
some big winners here.

01:44.367 --> 01:45.667
Man, we're gonna clean up.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.667
Yeah?

01:46.700 --> 01:50.168
Ah, give me the aspirin!

01:50.201 --> 01:51.867
That crumb!

01:51.901 --> 01:54.101
He's worse than crabs.

01:54.134 --> 01:56.268
That miserable
little loaf.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.567
Who? Who's he
talking about?

01:58.600 --> 02:02.001
John. You can go
to the track without him.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.634
That crumb had a wreck.

02:03.667 --> 02:04.634
What?

02:04.667 --> 02:05.934
How'd it happen?

02:05.967 --> 02:07.734
Was it serious?
Is he hurt?

02:07.767 --> 02:10.333
He's fine till I get
my hands on him

02:10.366 --> 02:11.767
and my feet.

02:11.801 --> 02:13.467
Hey, Louie! The guy's
had an accident.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.067
Don't walk all over him.

02:15.101 --> 02:16.734
He's probably in a lot of
trouble right now himself.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.934
He was driving 804.

02:18.967 --> 02:19.934
804?

02:19.967 --> 02:21.433
804?

02:21.467 --> 02:23.433
Louie, are you sure?

02:23.467 --> 02:25.734
I checked him out myself.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.234
Where's the aspirin?

02:27.268 --> 02:28.734
804?

02:28.767 --> 02:30.168
Man, that's impossible.

02:30.201 --> 02:33.067
I just drove her yesterday.

02:33.101 --> 02:35.101
I swear, I'm going to kill him.

02:35.134 --> 02:36.767
Louie, I know
you're upset.

02:36.801 --> 02:38.201
We all are.

02:38.234 --> 02:40.467
But you can't
blame John.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.333
Hey, we can't blame
John, can we?

02:42.367 --> 02:44.467
He never should have
wrecked that cab.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.268
Man, 804...

02:46.300 --> 02:48.901
another month,
she would have set a record.

02:48.934 --> 02:51.901
No cab ever went
a half a million miles before.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.467
ALEX:
Hey, Louie,
what's the damage?

02:53.500 --> 02:55.333
Won't know till we see her.

02:55.367 --> 02:58.001
But once you get
a tow hook in your fender,

02:58.034 --> 02:59.667
you're on short time.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.967
With that donkey,
figure the worst.

03:04.067 --> 03:05.934
I can't
believe it.

03:05.967 --> 03:07.134
There'll
never be

03:07.168 --> 03:08.534
another one
like her.

03:08.567 --> 03:09.567
You guys go on.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.168
I'm going to stay here and see
what happens

03:11.201 --> 03:12.467
Hey, I couldn't leave now.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.467
I mean, we can go
to the races anytime.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.134
Hey, I ain't ashamed
to say it.

03:16.168 --> 03:17.300
I loved that cab.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.834
We all loved it, Tony.

03:18.867 --> 03:21.067
There'll never be
another cab 804.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.400
What a cab.

03:22.433 --> 03:25.734
You put her into low,
and you know what she'd do?

03:25.767 --> 03:27.867
She'd go into low.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.834
It's like she knew
you trusted her.

03:32.867 --> 03:34.300
Damn!

03:34.333 --> 03:38.433
All the cabs we got here,
why did he have to wreck 804?

03:38.467 --> 03:39.967
You know what's ironic?

03:40.001 --> 03:42.034
I first met John in cab 804.

03:42.067 --> 03:45.467
<i>I was cruising around</i>
<i>Grand Central about 11:00.</i>

03:45.500 --> 03:47.067
MAN:
Taxi!

03:47.101 --> 03:48.767
( <i>whistles</i> )

03:49.500 --> 03:51.001
Over here, taxi.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.901
Hi.

03:57.934 --> 03:59.234
It's okay.

03:59.268 --> 04:00.600
I can manage.

04:02.834 --> 04:04.500
That's good.

04:15.168 --> 04:17.267
Would you like
the address?

04:17.300 --> 04:18.634
Huh?

04:18.666 --> 04:21.034
( <i>louder:</i> )
Would you like
the address?

04:21.067 --> 04:23.134
Sure. Why not?

04:23.168 --> 04:25.901
222 East 64th street.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.467
Huh?

04:27.500 --> 04:31.567
( <i>louder</i> :)
222 East 64th street.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.201
Hey, what's this thing?

04:33.234 --> 04:35.934
Safety shield.

04:35.967 --> 04:38.001
What do you
need it for?

04:38.034 --> 04:39.934
To protect me
from muggers.

04:39.967 --> 04:41.834
Oh...

04:45.801 --> 04:48.634
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

04:48.667 --> 04:51.901
I should have known then.

04:51.934 --> 04:55.433
Gee, that cab was like
a good luck charm to me.

04:55.467 --> 04:59.067
I was in 804
the night I got held up.

04:59.101 --> 05:00.300
That was lucky?

05:00.333 --> 05:03.134
I lived.

05:03.168 --> 05:04.934
<i>That was when</i>
<i>all those robberies</i>

05:04.967 --> 05:06.268
<i>were going on, you know?</i>

05:06.300 --> 05:08.001
<i>Remember when</i>
<i>I started carrying</i>

05:08.034 --> 05:09.967
<i>that big gun around</i>
<i>for protection?</i>

05:15.634 --> 05:17.201
( <i>whistling</i> )

05:25.201 --> 05:26.634
Oh, uh... sorry.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.101
I forgot
to lock that door.

05:29.134 --> 05:31.534
You're going to have
to sit in the back.

05:31.567 --> 05:32.967
Or the front.

05:33.001 --> 05:34.567
Whichever.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.134
I just want your fare money,
son. No games.

05:37.168 --> 05:39.801
Uh, I can't.

05:39.834 --> 05:43.433
See, it's locked in a strongbox,
and we don't have the keys.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.333
Hey, don't play
with me, man.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.600
It's in the cigar box
under the seat.

05:47.634 --> 05:49.333
You've done this before.

05:52.168 --> 05:53.834
The money.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.667
Okay, drop it!

06:00.700 --> 06:01.934
What?

06:01.967 --> 06:04.300
You heard me.
I said drop it.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.201
Drop it?

06:05.234 --> 06:06.500
Yeah, drop it.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.834
Come on, drop it.
I said drop it.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.934
Now drop it.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.500
No, man.

06:10.534 --> 06:12.767
You drop yours.

06:12.801 --> 06:13.934
I drew first.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.101
My gun's bigger.

06:20.134 --> 06:21.700
You should drop yours.

06:21.734 --> 06:24.268
Man, just give me
the money so I can go.

06:26.234 --> 06:28.767
You give me your money.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.700
See, man,
you don't understand.

06:38.734 --> 06:40.400
I do this for a living.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.934
You don't understand.

06:43.967 --> 06:47.034
You're not getting
a dime from this cab.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.700
Nobody really
expects for you

06:49.734 --> 06:51.667
to defend yourself
against this.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.600
You know? I mean, what you got,
a lousy 50, 60 bucks?

06:54.634 --> 06:57.400
It's just a Tuesday
night take, man.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.734
Use your head.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.534
You're not getting the money.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.034
And I ain't leaving here
without it.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.134
Yeah?
Well, it's your life, mister

07:04.168 --> 07:07.467
'cause nobody
holds me up.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.134
Uh, what is it?

07:10.168 --> 07:13.333
You get embarrassed
if you got robbed?

07:13.367 --> 07:18.767
Man, nowadays,
everybody gets robbed.

07:18.801 --> 07:19.767
I don't mean

07:19.801 --> 07:21.168
nothing personal.

07:21.201 --> 07:23.767
I don't mean this as a putdown
or nothing, man, but...

07:23.801 --> 07:26.067
why you giving me
such a hard time?

07:30.001 --> 07:32.867
I mean, you can see
my point, can't you?

07:32.901 --> 07:35.234
Now I really believe
that we could--

07:35.268 --> 07:37.801
we can break through
the racial barriers

07:37.834 --> 07:40.801
and come to a genuine
understanding here, man.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.867
You're not getting the money.

07:42.901 --> 07:46.367
You pasty-faced, vanilla,
lily-white towhead.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.634
( <i>cat meows</i> )

07:55.667 --> 07:57.234
What time is it, man?

07:57.268 --> 08:00.567
I'm not telling you.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.168
There's probably a clock

08:02.201 --> 08:04.268
around here somewhere.

08:07.634 --> 08:10.567
Wh-what's so funny?

08:13.967 --> 08:16.067
You got a ticket.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.534
While we were sitting here

08:21.567 --> 08:23.600
we fogged up
the windows so much

08:23.634 --> 08:25.534
a cop came by,
gave us a ticket

08:25.567 --> 08:29.034
and didn't even spot us.

08:29.067 --> 08:33.034
Now, that's funny.

08:33.067 --> 08:35.667
What a sensational night.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.067
Why don't you

08:37.101 --> 08:38.467
give me the money?

08:38.500 --> 08:41.101
You're not getting the money.

08:41.134 --> 08:42.234
Oh.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.067
Come on, man.

08:59.101 --> 09:00.734
Tell me what time it is.

09:00.767 --> 09:01.867
I bet it's 1:00.

09:01.901 --> 09:04.500
Shank of the evening.

09:04.534 --> 09:06.767
You don't even know
what you doing.

09:06.801 --> 09:08.101
Look at your hand.

09:08.134 --> 09:10.300
It's all throbbing from holding
that big gun.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.067
You can't make it, man.

09:13.101 --> 09:14.901
You at the end of the line.

09:16.934 --> 09:19.801
Hey, you're just
as tired as I am.

09:19.834 --> 09:25.067
Huh, I sure am.

09:25.101 --> 09:27.101
Okay, I got an idea.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.834
Let's give each other a break

09:29.867 --> 09:33.001
and switch guns
to the other hand.

09:33.034 --> 09:35.201
Okay?

09:38.367 --> 09:39.700
Okay.

09:39.734 --> 09:42.500
Okay. Now, we switch
on the count of three.

09:42.534 --> 09:45.201
Yeah, but no funny stuff, man.
I'll count.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.134
I'll come in
if you get stuck.

09:47.168 --> 09:48.834
Okay.

09:51.433 --> 09:54.734
One... two...

09:54.767 --> 09:55.967
three!

09:57.967 --> 09:59.234
Hey, man.

09:59.268 --> 10:01.067
Hey, you did that
on purpose.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.067
You got my gun
and I got yours.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.201
Let's switch.

10:04.234 --> 10:05.201
Uh-uh.

10:05.234 --> 10:06.567
Why not?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.400
Mine wasn't loaded.

10:08.433 --> 10:13.667
Well, m-mine isn't either.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.734
Oh, yes, it is, man.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.134
I saw the cartridges.

10:16.168 --> 10:17.367
Now come on, man,
it's all over with now.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.367
Come on,
just give me the money.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.168
Come on.

10:20.901 --> 10:22.567
Hey, man, what the..?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.333
They're stuck.

10:31.201 --> 10:34.600
Hey, man, you're nuts.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.234
Aw, that's it, man.

10:38.268 --> 10:42.734
Man, I... you ain't no fun
to stick up, man.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.034
That's it.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.634
I'm getting out of here.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.101
Hey, not so fast.

10:48.134 --> 10:50.234
You owe me 38 bucks.

10:50.268 --> 10:51.333
For what?

10:51.367 --> 10:52.901
The meter was running.

10:52.934 --> 10:55.433
No, no, no...

10:55.467 --> 10:56.600
You make it 48.

10:56.634 --> 10:58.600
I forgot about the ticket.

11:00.101 --> 11:01.567
Now, stop.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.867
Now, I mean it.

11:02.901 --> 11:04.367
'Cause I-I'll hit you.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.567
Come on, come on.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.600
Seven... eight.

11:20.901 --> 11:22.034
All right.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.934
I hope you're
satisfied now.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.934
Hey, now I don't have
enough for cab fare home.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.534
What's your address?

11:34.567 --> 11:35.934
447 West 23rd street.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.101
You take me there?

11:37.134 --> 11:38.234
No, I just want

11:38.268 --> 11:40.667
to tell the cops
where you live.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.034
Good night.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.034
That's incredible, Bobby,
the way you stood up to him.

11:52.067 --> 11:54.034
Did he get arrested?

11:54.067 --> 11:55.300
Oh, yeah.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.567
I got a little
commendation for it

11:57.600 --> 11:59.834
and a little piece
in the paper...

11:59.867 --> 12:01.834
nothing to write home about.

12:01.867 --> 12:03.467
Well...

12:06.134 --> 12:08.667
"Heroic Cabby
Cracks Down On Crime."

12:08.700 --> 12:11.300
Third page, 14 paragraphs,
small photo.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.367
I'd almost forgotten
about it.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.834
Oh, yeah.

12:14.867 --> 12:17.001
Hey, I saved a guy's life
once in 804.

12:17.034 --> 12:18.001
No kidding?

12:18.034 --> 12:19.001
Saved a guy's life?

12:19.034 --> 12:19.867
How'd you do that?

12:19.901 --> 12:21.867
You didn't save
anybody's life.

12:21.901 --> 12:22.634
Sure, I did.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.834
You did not.

12:23.867 --> 12:25.367
It was no big thing.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.801
I mean, the guy whose
life I saved

12:27.834 --> 12:29.168
he wasn't so hot.

12:29.201 --> 12:30.500
Hey, you're not kidding are you?

12:30.534 --> 12:32.034
Well, what happened?

12:32.067 --> 12:33.333
See, well...

12:33.367 --> 12:36.433
<i>I picked this guy up</i>
<i>by the train station</i>

12:36.467 --> 12:39.300

MAN:
Taxi!

12:40.934 --> 12:43.433
Taxi!

12:46.234 --> 12:47.667
Where to?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.001
I don't know yet.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.333
Just drive, okay?

12:50.367 --> 12:51.967
Okay.

12:52.001 --> 12:55.600
TONY:
<i>So, I'm tooling around Queens</i>
<i>for about 20 minutes</i>

12:55.634 --> 12:58.767
<i>and the next thing I know,</i>
<i>I'm on the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

12:58.801 --> 13:01.268
Excuse me, would
you stop here, please?

13:01.300 --> 13:02.500
What are you, crazy?

13:02.534 --> 13:04.234
This is a bridge.

13:04.268 --> 13:07.400
I know. I'm going to jump off
and kill myself.

13:10.234 --> 13:12.101
Hey, don't do that!

13:15.067 --> 13:16.300
Okay.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.300

13:18.333 --> 13:19.634

Thanks.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.034
TONY:
It's okay.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.034
That's all there
was to it?

13:24.067 --> 13:25.201
Yeah.

13:25.234 --> 13:27.834
He has the nerve to compare
that story with mine.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.500
At least I didn't take
an hour to tell it.

13:29.534 --> 13:31.101
Oh, it's a lousy story.
It is not.

13:31.134 --> 13:32.901
Hey, you guys,
will you knock it off.

13:32.934 --> 13:34.168
It's not important.

13:34.201 --> 13:36.801
It doesn't matter
whose story is better.

13:36.834 --> 13:39.667
What matters is,
they both happened in 804.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.500
I got a great story.

13:41.534 --> 13:42.901
ALEX:
Oh, come on Louie,
not now will ya?

13:42.934 --> 13:46.834
I had a guy in this cab
once when I was hacking--

13:46.867 --> 13:49.867
a real shrewdie,
you know what I mean?

13:49.901 --> 13:52.934
I mean, this guy
was one tough cookie.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.201
Get over!

13:54.234 --> 13:55.534
( <i>tires screech</i> )

13:55.567 --> 13:58.268
Get over, you bum you!

13:58.300 --> 13:59.801
Piece of dirt.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.967
MAN:
Taxi!

14:06.067 --> 14:08.034
MAN:
All right, get in.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.201
Driver, I want you
to take him

14:10.234 --> 14:12.867
to the Walden School,
this address.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.834
Now, here's your luggage,
and don't lose it.

14:18.867 --> 14:20.333
And don't sell it.

14:20.367 --> 14:21.667
Yeah, yeah.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.867
Here you go.

14:22.901 --> 14:24.433
$20 ought to cover it.

14:24.467 --> 14:27.367
All right, now, remember:
this $600

14:27.400 --> 14:30.801
is for food, books,
and necessities.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.867
It's not
for gambling.

14:32.901 --> 14:35.234
It's not
for pornography.

14:35.268 --> 14:37.333
It's not
to purchase weapons.

14:37.367 --> 14:38.767
Yeah, yeah.

14:38.801 --> 14:40.600
You a father?

14:40.634 --> 14:43.767
I don't think so.

14:43.801 --> 14:46.067
Don't be.

14:46.101 --> 14:47.734
All right, we'll see you
for Thanksgiving.

14:47.767 --> 14:48.700
And I'll tell
your mother

14:48.734 --> 14:49.901
you're sorry
you made her cry.

14:49.934 --> 14:51.300
BOY:
Yeah, yeah.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.801
( <i>groans</i> )

15:04.667 --> 15:07.934
This is De Palma
in 804.

15:07.967 --> 15:11.767
Taking a fare
to the Walden School...

15:11.801 --> 15:13.433
Central Park West.

15:13.467 --> 15:16.934
DISPATCHER:
Bully for you, De Palma.

15:16.967 --> 15:19.367
Two fares in five hours.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.867
A good day.

15:20.901 --> 15:22.700
Yeah, yeah.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.034
Who's he?

15:24.067 --> 15:25.534
My dispatcher.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.700
All dispatchers
are scum.

15:27.734 --> 15:29.134
Remember that.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.333
Hey, I'll give you another
20 if you let me drive.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.600
What, do you think I'm crazy?

15:37.634 --> 15:39.234
You'd kill somebody.

15:39.268 --> 15:41.067
I'd lose my license.

15:41.101 --> 15:42.067
30?

15:42.101 --> 15:43.433
Okay.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.168
Fork it over.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.967
Get in there.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.134
I don't need
this pillow.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.168
You sure you know
how to do this?

16:10.201 --> 16:11.667
You don't steal cars

16:11.700 --> 16:14.201
without knowing
how to drive them.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.134
Keep it over.

16:22.168 --> 16:24.433
Who's driving,
you or me?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.700
Nice jacket
you're wearing.

16:28.734 --> 16:30.333
It ought to be.

16:30.367 --> 16:31.667
It's tailor-made.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.001
150 bucks.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.101
Really?

16:35.134 --> 16:38.667
My whole outfit
cost me 75.

16:38.700 --> 16:43.300
That includes 65
for the transistor radio.

16:45.268 --> 16:47.934
What's it like
being rich?

16:47.967 --> 16:50.001
What's it like
being poor?

16:50.034 --> 16:52.567
Don't be a wise guy.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.834
I asked you
a real question,

16:54.867 --> 16:58.034
trying to make
polite conversation.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.600
What's your mother
look like?

17:02.567 --> 17:04.001
Like that.

17:06.867 --> 17:10.433
Ooh... very nice.

17:10.467 --> 17:12.001
You don't mind if I say

17:12.034 --> 17:14.534
your mother's
a very attractive woman?

17:14.567 --> 17:18.268
Very nice bagonzas,
if you know what I mean.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.167
What are bagonzas?

17:20.201 --> 17:21.700
How old are you?

17:21.733 --> 17:22.767
12.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.534
Bagonzas are feet.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.634
Red light.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.801
Do you really have $600
in here?

17:33.834 --> 17:35.067
Yeah.

17:35.101 --> 17:37.234
Hey, you want
to make a bet?

17:37.268 --> 17:38.734
What sort of bet?

17:38.767 --> 17:39.901
Green.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.234
I don't know.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.400
All right.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.967
I bet you I can say
all 50 states

17:45.001 --> 17:46.767
in less than a minute.

17:46.801 --> 17:49.767
All 50 states
in less than a minute?

17:49.801 --> 17:50.834
Yeah.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.001
How much?

17:52.034 --> 17:53.834
A hundred.

17:56.767 --> 18:00.201
I can't bet a hundred bucks
with a kid.

18:00.234 --> 18:01.801
A rich kid?

18:01.834 --> 18:03.934
Good point.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.967
You're on.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.333
Let me see
your hundred first.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.700
All right.

18:11.734 --> 18:15.367
I'll bet you you can't say
all 50 states

18:15.400 --> 18:17.467
in less than a minute.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.201
And I'll time you.

18:19.234 --> 18:22.367
I'll tell you when to go.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.201
All right...

18:24.234 --> 18:25.201
go.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.700
All 50 states.

18:26.734 --> 18:29.867
I can't believe you fell
for that old trick.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.268
Man, what a stiff.

18:37.734 --> 18:39.901
I can't believe it either.

18:39.934 --> 18:43.500
Hey, you want a
chance to get even?

18:43.534 --> 18:44.834
I don't know.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.268
What's the bet?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.400
All right.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.268
I'll bet you another hundred

18:49.300 --> 18:52.500
that I can tell you the score
between tonight's game

18:52.534 --> 18:54.734
between the Knicks
and the Celtics

18:54.767 --> 18:56.034
before it starts.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.268
Hmm...

18:58.300 --> 18:59.934
You're going to bet me

18:59.967 --> 19:02.667
that you can tell me
the actual score

19:02.700 --> 19:06.067
of the game that's going
to be played tonight

19:06.101 --> 19:08.700
between
the New York Knickerbockers

19:08.734 --> 19:10.467
and the Boston Celtics?

19:10.500 --> 19:13.834
You can tell me that score
before it starts?

19:13.867 --> 19:16.001
Yeah.

19:16.034 --> 19:17.901
You're on.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.500
Zero-zero.

19:30.234 --> 19:33.467
Boy, I wish this
was a longer trip.

19:35.734 --> 19:38.201
But, unfortunately,
we're here.

19:42.734 --> 19:46.201
Hey, you want another
chance to get even?

19:46.234 --> 19:47.534
No, thanks.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.534
No more tricks.

19:49.567 --> 19:51.300
No, no, this isn't a trick.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.767
It's a simple contest
between two men.

19:53.801 --> 19:56.934
We'll see who can hold
their breath the longest.

19:56.967 --> 19:59.433
No tricks, huh?

19:59.467 --> 20:01.600
Strictly on the level.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.934
You sure?

20:02.967 --> 20:04.234
I'm sure.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.333
For how much?

20:08.367 --> 20:10.433
The whole 800.

20:12.433 --> 20:14.367
Do you smoke?

20:16.168 --> 20:18.034
Camels, unfiltered.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.034
You're on.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.201
Four, five, six,
seven, eight.

20:26.234 --> 20:27.767
All right.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.767
I'll say
"One, two, three"

20:29.801 --> 20:31.168
and then we'll start.

20:31.201 --> 20:32.500
All right?

20:32.534 --> 20:33.567
One...

20:33.600 --> 20:35.201
two...

20:35.234 --> 20:36.500
three...

20:36.534 --> 20:38.034
Go.

21:03.101 --> 21:04.400
Hey, you okay?!

21:04.433 --> 21:05.767
You breathed!

21:22.367 --> 21:24.367
Hey, come on,
don't cry.

21:24.400 --> 21:28.300
That money was supposed
to last me all year.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.700
Now I don't know
what I'm going to do.

21:31.734 --> 21:34.201
Aw, come, come here...

21:34.234 --> 21:36.268
aw, there, there, aw...

21:36.300 --> 21:38.433
easy... easy.

21:38.467 --> 21:40.600
You're not such
a bad little tyke

21:40.634 --> 21:42.101
after all.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.101
Losing this money
really puts you in a spot,

21:45.134 --> 21:46.433
doesn't it?

21:46.467 --> 21:47.767
It sure does.

21:47.801 --> 21:49.901
Okay, okay.
There, there, there.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.400
All right, all right.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.834
I'll tell you what.

21:54.801 --> 21:56.767
Have you learned
your lesson?

21:56.801 --> 21:58.967
You bet I have.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.168
Well, then...

22:03.101 --> 22:04.400
here.

22:04.433 --> 22:06.300
Here's $20.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.834
You take $600 from a child?

22:19.867 --> 22:22.168
You call that a great story?

22:22.201 --> 22:24.067
He was a monster.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.867
And I don't care

22:25.901 --> 22:29.934
if it was
an old lady's life savings.

22:29.967 --> 22:32.934
600 bucks
is a great story.

22:35.201 --> 22:38.867
Hey, maybe we're all
getting upset for nothing.

22:38.901 --> 22:42.901
I mean, we don't know for sure
that 804 is totaled.

22:42.934 --> 22:45.600
Maybe it was
just a fender bender.

22:45.634 --> 22:47.534
Hi, everybody.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.333
I'm fine.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.600
Hey, everything's all right.

22:52.634 --> 22:54.367
I'm fine.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.801
<i>Next week, more memories</i>
<i>of Cab 804.</i>

23:18.734 --> 23:20.168
Stop the cab!
What for?

23:20.201 --> 23:21.801
We've skipped phase two.
We're too late.

23:21.834 --> 23:22.801
<i>We're</i> too late?

she's having the baby.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.801
She's still contracting.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.268
This is it,
this is the baby.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.734
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, listen...

This is cab 804.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.333

be a little late.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.667
I have an out-
of-town fare.

LOUIE:
Good. How late will you be?

23:37.367 --> 23:38.567
Don't wait up.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.534
804'S about to go
under the wrench.

23:40.567 --> 23:41.834
I can fix it.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.101
So, would you spend
the night with me tonight?

23:50.400 --> 23:51.567
What about her?

23:51.600 --> 23:52.734
You'll have to take over.

23:52.767 --> 23:53.867
Me?!

23:53.901 --> 23:55.801
Mm-hmm.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.801
I quit.
