WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:04.805
So, Jessica,
I heard you broke up with Brad.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.640
Who are you gonna date
now that you can date anyone?

00:06.674 --> 00:07.808
I don't know.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.678
I mean, obviously if someone
special comes along...

00:10.711 --> 00:13.247
B-But I mean
really special, like,

00:13.281 --> 00:15.649
nothing I've even remotely
considered in the past.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.152
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit.
I want that kind of love like
that docking kind of love.

00:18.186 --> 00:21.389
Oh, yeah.
Like, penis in the foreskin
kind of love...

00:21.422 --> 00:25.059
Mm-hmm.
just, like,
warm, just like...

00:25.093 --> 00:26.827
He...

00:29.530 --> 00:30.998
Everybody fuck off.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.333
Morty, I need your help.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.268
W-W-W-We... We need to go
on a quick adventure.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.736
You said
I could go to school today.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.771
That was before
I needed something, Morty.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.907
There's a plasma shard
in the Abadango Cluster.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.510
A princess has it.
If I get it, I'll be awesome.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.213
We've been going non-stop, Rick.
It's not healthy.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.714
You know,
these are my teenage years.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.516
I-I just found out
Jessica's single.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.685
Oh, that's... Wow, Morty. Wow.
What an exciting life you lead.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.455
Let's go. In and out,
20 minutes adventure.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.425
They're on our tail!

00:57.458 --> 00:58.892
Steady, Morty.
Five cetons.

00:58.926 --> 01:03.597
**

01:03.631 --> 01:06.066
Steady, God damn it!
Two cetons.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.801
Wha!

01:12.506 --> 01:14.175
Fire!

01:16.110 --> 01:18.045
Pull up, Morty, pull up!
Pull up!

01:43.036 --> 01:46.640
Fuck

01:50.344 --> 01:51.612
Oh, FUCK!

01:51.645 --> 01:52.780
Fuck

01:52.813 --> 01:55.249
Ahh! Ahh!

01:55.283 --> 01:57.418
I can't fucking do this anymore!

01:57.451 --> 01:59.920
That was seriously fucked up.
We almost died.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.257
So you agree?
Fuck yes!
That w... T-This was insane!

02:03.291 --> 02:04.592
That was pure luck.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.027
I was not in control
of that situation at all.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.933
Look at this, Morty.
Look at my fucking hand.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.170
Look at this shit.
Why do you keep doing this
to us?!

02:16.204 --> 02:17.638
I don't know, Morty.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.207
Maybe I hate myself,
maybe I think I deserve to die.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.941
I-I-I-I don't...
I don't know!

02:24.077 --> 02:26.113
We need a vacation.

02:26.146 --> 02:34.121
**

02:34.154 --> 02:42.062
**

02:42.095 --> 02:50.003
**

02:50.037 --> 02:57.978
**

03:04.585 --> 03:06.487
Isn't that something?
You were right...

03:06.520 --> 03:07.988
Best day spa in the galaxy.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.423
It's not even cruel, either.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.858
These things are just doing what
they do in the wild...

03:10.891 --> 03:12.660
It loves swallowing
stressed-out creatures

03:12.693 --> 03:14.328
for 20 minutes
and then puking them up.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.564
My whole body's
like a baby's ass.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.732
Complimentary
psychological detox?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.368
Removes
all your cognitive toxins,

03:20.401 --> 03:21.735
purifies your system.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.571
Oof, this guy on commission
or something?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.373
I don't think...
Are you on commission?

03:25.406 --> 03:27.007
We're not on commission.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.075
We get paid by the hour.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.209
There's no incentive really...

03:29.243 --> 03:30.283
Oh, my God.
Okay, listen...

03:30.311 --> 03:31.579
W-W-W-We'll try
the machine,

03:31.612 --> 03:33.113
but... but I'd like you
to try something.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.849
Try swallowing
the giant ball of snot

03:35.883 --> 03:37.685
that's dangling around
in the back of your throat.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.119
It's disgusting.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.454
Nobody wants to hear that.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.258
That's what you do.
Okay, Rick, come on.
Enough.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.260
Man, did you hear me bite
that guy's head off?

03:46.294 --> 03:47.861
Geez, I really need to chill.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.097
Maybe you should go through
twice.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.301
All right, mister comedy man,
you don't have to bust my balls.
You're not helping things.

03:53.334 --> 03:57.204
Rick, is this thing
supposed to be making this...

04:04.845 --> 04:07.147
Morty!

04:07.180 --> 04:08.649
- Ri-Rick...
- Morty!

04:08.682 --> 04:10.318
What happened?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.786
We blew up, idiot!
Are you really that stupid?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.900
Obviously the guy I yelled at
overloaded the machine.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.322
It takes more than that to kill
Rick and Morty, motherfucker!

04:20.127 --> 04:21.629
But this might do it.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.564
Run, Morty!
E-Everything hurts!

04:23.597 --> 04:25.466
That's because you're worthless!

04:25.499 --> 04:28.101
Jesus,
how big was this explosion?

04:28.135 --> 04:29.737
I'm a genius. I don't have time
for this shit.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.772
W-W-We're in Hell,
aren't we, Rick?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.907
- You're so stupid, Morty.
- You're an idiot.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.743
There's no such thing as Hell.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.911
I believe you,
but I just want to die.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.814
You can die when I say so.
I control you.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.517
I control the universe!
Why am I bragging about that?

04:43.551 --> 04:44.918
I have nothing to prove.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.054
I'm surrounded by inferior
pieces of shit and...

04:48.956 --> 04:50.090
Toxins.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.926
We're not in Hell, Morty.
We're in the detoxifier.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.095
The machine didn't blow up.
It worked normally.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.430
It removed our toxins.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.931
We're the toxins.

04:57.965 --> 04:58.965
Are you listening,

04:58.966 --> 05:00.434
you stupid little
garbage person?!

05:00.468 --> 05:02.670
We're what got removed!!

05:04.705 --> 05:07.475
I hope you both found that detox
sufficiently relaxing.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.943
Hey, man, listen...
Those comments I made
about your throat?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.379
It's all good.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.180
It's nice of you
to let me off the hook.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.816
It's still unacceptable
behavior, and I do regret it.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.785
Believe me, man, I've been
working here a long time.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.886
I get it.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.291
Hey, uh, you mind
if I put on some music?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.793
Not at all.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.996
* Grab my terrifolds

05:29.029 --> 05:31.365
What is that?
I just hit shuffle.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.900
Are you kidding?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.035
- This universe.
- Oh, excuse me.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.004
We should listen to one random
song a day, you know?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.839
We'd end up hearing
more songs we didn't like,

05:38.872 --> 05:40.541
but we'd discover
a lot more that we did.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.875
That is an interesting concept.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.343
You know, it makes me wonder

05:43.377 --> 05:44.812
if there's
an algorithmic expression

05:44.845 --> 05:46.380
that could achieve
the ideal ratio.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.715
Listen to me...

05:47.748 --> 05:50.518
Trying to calculate
happiness over here.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.019
Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.987
Hey, here's something
no science could measure...

05:54.021 --> 05:56.356
I'm real proud
to be your grandpa, Morty.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.325
Thanks, Rick.
I love you.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.828
Yeah, motherfucker!
Yeah! Get it! Get some!

06:00.861 --> 06:02.996
Right up your fucking bitch ass,
you fuck!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.932
Guess who just discovered
a new element?!

06:04.965 --> 06:06.700
You think you could do that,
Morty?

06:06.734 --> 06:09.503
You think anyone but me could do
that ever in a billion years?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.539
Do you think if God existed
he could do it?

06:11.572 --> 06:12.706
The answer is no.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.542
If God exists, it's fucking me.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.510
Yes, Rick.
I-I agree, Rick.

06:16.544 --> 06:19.246
While you were flapping
your parasitic turd holster,

06:19.279 --> 06:22.015
I discovered the
toxic equivalent
of electricity, Morty.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.551
What do you think about that?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.553
Uh... I th... I think my voice
is annoying.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.354
It is,
and it's your best quality.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.756
So true.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.559
Now, who can tell me
the common denominator

06:31.592 --> 06:32.926
of these two factions?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.028
You don't know
or y'all just bored?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.297
Hey, listen, you know, wha...
If we're all bored over here,

06:37.330 --> 06:39.600
wouldn't the common denominator
be you?

06:39.633 --> 06:42.035
Damn, Morty.
That's hilarious.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.472
Normally I would come down
on any kind of disruption,

06:44.505 --> 06:46.073
but it seems to represent
a positive change

06:46.106 --> 06:47.107
for your character.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.909
Class dismissed!

06:48.942 --> 06:50.711
- Awesome, Morty!
- You done good, Morty.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.045
Girl: Oh, yeah!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.647
Thanks for the advice,
Morty.
You got it.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.315
I did it, Morty!
I knew you could.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.550
Hey, Morty, remember yesterday

06:56.584 --> 06:58.118
when I couldn't
play the trombone?

06:58.151 --> 06:59.553
Well, check this out!

07:01.421 --> 07:02.723
Just like I told you, Mitch...

07:02.756 --> 07:04.257
The music was in your heart
the whole time.

07:04.291 --> 07:08.228
Stupid hat... Wish I had
the courage to just be myself.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.997
There you are.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.901
You might have
all these idiots fooled,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.570
but I know you're still
the same pathetic loser

07:16.604 --> 07:18.472
hiding behind
a confident facade.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.140
I know that because...

07:20.173 --> 07:22.610
I'm doing the same thing,
brother.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.411
I'm not alone anymore!

07:24.444 --> 07:28.582
Hey, Morty. Word around school
is you've become super healthy.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.017
I don't know about all that.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.985
I do, however, know that I have
a pretty bad case of

07:32.019 --> 07:34.421
haven't taken you
to dinner-itis.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.756
Might be fatal.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.658
Hey, kids.
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.292
Morty, a moment of your time?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.494
Happy to help, Rick.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.995
I hate to bug you with this,

07:42.029 --> 07:44.031
but after our morning hike
I started receiving very faint,

07:44.064 --> 07:46.667
highly unusual transmissions
on my sub ether phone.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.768
Listen.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.841
It's a bad phone.
Chuck it.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.943
I downgraded to a clamshell
for emergencies only.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.611
You know, if... if... if
something's worth saying,

07:57.645 --> 07:58.846
i-it's worth eye contact.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.814
Uh, I-I-I traced
the source of the call

08:00.848 --> 08:02.616
back to the spa we went to,
Morty.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.117
I thought I could hear
a voice in there,

08:04.151 --> 08:07.187
so I enhanced it,
a-and listen.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.222
Gunk Rick:
Hey, asshole!
Gunk Morty: Oh, man!

08:09.256 --> 08:11.124
Remember us?
Oh, I don't like confrontation!

08:11.158 --> 08:12.993
You fucked us,
you pieces of garbage!

08:13.026 --> 08:15.362
That's right,
you're fucking garbage, not us.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.697
I'm a fucking genius and a god.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.231
You really think
this thing can hold me?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.167
I'm gonna rip your throat...

08:20.200 --> 08:22.803
Morty, what if the toxic parts
of us have their own identities,

08:22.836 --> 08:24.071
their own will to live?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.806
W-What if mine shares
my intelligence

08:25.839 --> 08:27.675
and devised a way
to reach out to us?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.876
Sounds like
he's in a lot of pain.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.044
Lot. O. Pain.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.013
But, you know, you shouldn't
have to deal with that, man.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.525
You know,
l-let's work off your trauma

08:34.548 --> 08:35.649
with some urban spin yoga.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.317
It's amazing.
You do yoga on a bike,

08:37.350 --> 08:38.751
but you have
an at-risk preteen...

08:38.785 --> 08:40.654
I don't think I can
just blow this off, Morty.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.490
If I had known it worked this
way, I wouldn't have detoxed.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.392
Well, I would have
because I was toxic.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.662
Now I'm detoxed and I'm
accountable to my toxins, right?

08:48.696 --> 08:51.665
I-It's a dilemma.
I think I know what to do.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.433
Morty!
Rick!

08:53.466 --> 08:56.003
You know, the only problem here
is a big fat brain

08:56.036 --> 08:58.171
that misses eating
all them big fat problems.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.008
Focus on the good thing.
Trust me, things are good.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.910
Taking that away from me...

09:02.943 --> 09:04.678
that wouldn't be healthy.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.584
Oh, man. World's Greatest
Grandpa, for reals.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.352
It's not just a coffee cup
for you, bud.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.787
You're legit.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.193
I love drums.
I never took drum lessons.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.130
Why? Limitations. We are
addicted to our own limitations.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.163
How amazing is that?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.564
Is the kale prepared
in the kitchen?

09:25.565 --> 09:26.967
I'll have a water.
Uh...

09:27.000 --> 09:29.637
How is the...
"cru-dite?"

09:29.670 --> 09:31.972
Crudité.
It's a cup of carrot sticks.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.041
Ha! It's okay!
Pronounce it however you want.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.943
Words are just things.
Please. Thank you.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.377
We're having a conversation.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.546
God, I am so excited
to finally have dinner with you.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.414
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

09:41.448 --> 09:42.650
It's like, whew!

09:42.683 --> 09:44.217
I-I-I wish you'd shut up,
though.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.219
Just kidding. You know,
you're so quiet. What's wrong?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.788
W-Why don't you tell me
about yourself?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.289
What's the atmosphere like
on planet Jessica?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.792
Where's the equator,
what are the vacations,

09:51.825 --> 09:53.293
a-and the holidays?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.395
I mean, you know,
are they the same time?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.065
Talk to me.
Well... I...
like this restaurant.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.334
Holy shit! Holy shit!
We have a moron over here!

10:01.368 --> 10:02.736
I'm an idiot.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.004
I can't believe I haven't
thought of this.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.806
You have to do
this detox thing I did.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.607
It's an alien spa,
you go through it,

10:07.641 --> 10:08.676
fwoos-s-s-ssh,

10:08.709 --> 10:10.744
lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa...

10:10.778 --> 10:13.180
sucks everything out.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.982
Everything that was holding me
back, everything bad,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.583
I mean, it just...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.085
Right?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.087
Cooooool.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.322
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.291
Yeah, phones are awful,
I downgraded to...

10:24.324 --> 10:25.959
I totally forgot my...

10:25.993 --> 10:29.362
I have a... thing, and...

10:29.396 --> 10:31.965
Things are good.
You know what?
Why am I doing that?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.366
That's more rude than the truth.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.669
Look, I'm sorry, Morty.
I just don't think...

10:35.703 --> 10:39.106
Do not. Even.
You have no need to explain.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.441
It's all good.
I think you'd get bored
with me.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.643
E-Exactly.
Look, the sparks aren't flying.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.278
This is what dating is for,
you know?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.214
First date, no sparks.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.683
No damage, no worries.
Life is a highway.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.451
We're gonna ride it
all night lonnngg!

10:51.484 --> 10:53.320
Gonna eat some "crudite."
Mmm!

10:53.353 --> 10:56.123
Is this organic? Mmm.
All right.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.858
You know, the evening continues.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.993
Okay, here we go.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.329
Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.031
Your money's no good here.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.532
I'll... I'll get the next round,
sir.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.168
Aren't you a child?
Only in the ways
that matter.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.303
Morty.
Stacy.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.805
I've been watching you drink,
Stacy.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.206
I get the feeling
you've got a hard job.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.075
I wonder what it takes
to please you.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.210
That's the job I want...
Part time, full time,

11:17.244 --> 11:19.046
I want to be good at it,
bad at it,

11:19.079 --> 11:22.015
I want to get promoted, fired,
corner office, hostile takeover,

11:22.049 --> 11:24.317
workplace accident...
I'm on my knees, Stacy...

11:24.351 --> 11:27.154
Praying, worshipping, begging,
whatever you want.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.657
What do you think about that?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.892
Okay. fuck it.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.193
Tink.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.263
Stacy: Mm!

11:36.296 --> 11:38.498
Let's ask my grandpa.
He's a scientist.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.701
Hey, Rick, are you familiar
with "benoi" technology?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.003
Morty, great news.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.237
I went back to the spa
and they let me purchase

11:44.271 --> 11:46.006
the containment unit
from their detoxifier.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.008
Why?
Because we're coming home,
bitch!

11:48.041 --> 11:51.178
What is this?
This is the parts of your pussy
grandpa that keep it real.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.413
Oh... oh, and I think you
dropped something, too!

11:53.446 --> 11:54.514
I don't want to be on camera.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.949
I'm ugly and gross, please.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.851
Should I go?
You're your own person,
Stacy.

11:57.885 --> 11:58.886
Then I'd like to stay.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.387
Rick, please tell me

12:00.420 --> 12:02.289
you're not trying to put
that stuff back inside of us.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.724
Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff
is alive and it belongs with us.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.094
We yanked them from their homes
and locked them in a can.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.628
Motherfucker!

12:08.661 --> 12:10.030
See?
They're living in pain.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.899
That's what they do, Rick,
they live in pain.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.566
They are pain, you know?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.302
They... they're all the bad
parts of us, which, by the way,

12:15.335 --> 12:16.770
includes our dishonesty,

12:16.804 --> 12:18.705
so how do you know this isn't
all some sort of crazy trick?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.641
Oh, so now because I'm
made entirely of toxins
I'm also a liar?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.276
Fuck you, you little sociopath.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.445
You hear this, Morty?
Oh, everybody hates me.
I can tell.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.047
Y-You all
hate me...
All right,
shut up, Morty.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.640
Healthy Rick,
are we doing this or what?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.317
Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you
to step into the booth.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.552
Don't negotiate
with that little turd, dummy.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.121
You're the Rick.
You need to show dominance.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.657
Morty, booth, now. Booth!

12:37.690 --> 12:39.226
Come on, Morty.
Don't touch me!

12:39.259 --> 12:41.728
Morty, do the healthy thing and
voluntarily retoxify yourself.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.996
Nooooo!

12:43.030 --> 12:44.464
Is it wrong if I think
this is kind of hot?

12:44.497 --> 12:46.499
Let me out of here!
Stacy, help! Open the door!

12:46.533 --> 12:48.335
I need to hear our safe word,
Morty.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.237
Sea Cucumber!
Sea Cucumber!

12:50.270 --> 12:52.405
What are you doing?
I'll do anything for you,
Morty.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.007
No!

12:55.542 --> 12:59.012
It worked! Yes!
That idiot believed every word.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.148
Now let's see how he enjoys
living in that shit tank.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.916
He's right behind me, isn't he?

13:02.950 --> 13:05.919
He's in front of you.
Oh.
My eyes are still adjusting.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.787
Uh, is this like a sex dungeon?

13:07.821 --> 13:10.023
I guess I should've been
paying attention.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.026
After 70 years
of being bottled up

13:13.060 --> 13:14.427
inside a sentimental jackass,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.263
I finally get to live
my own life.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.199
You said we were merging.
I lied, dumbass!
I lie about everything!

13:19.232 --> 13:21.534
Why would I ever re-merge
with a pussy like you?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.436
So... you were just gonna trap us
in that tank?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.706
T-That was your plan?
Not wa motherfucker...
still is.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.308
Kill him, Rick!

13:28.341 --> 13:29.676
I don't like this!
This is scary!

13:29.709 --> 13:30.789
All right, you asked for it.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.379
Did I ask for this?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.982
Did I ask for this?
Huh? Did I?

13:35.015 --> 13:37.050
Assessing threat to groin.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.319
Groin System 6000.
Kill him!

13:40.387 --> 13:42.222
That... is my groin's user.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.723
Believe me, I got a lot more use
out of that thing

13:43.756 --> 13:45.025
than he ever did.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.560
You know what?
Not my table.

13:50.097 --> 13:55.402
You do know me.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.736
What the hell, Grandpa Rick?

13:56.769 --> 13:58.171
Fuck you, Summer!
Sorry, Summer!

13:59.439 --> 14:01.574
Okay, okay, take it easy.
Don't do it.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.810
I love you. Good boy.

14:03.843 --> 14:04.912
Daddy's little boy.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.346
Summer,
get out of here! Go!

14:06.379 --> 14:07.414
Oh, who's that?

14:07.447 --> 14:08.916
Who's that over there?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.684
Oh, no. You see the bad man
in front of you?

14:11.718 --> 14:12.986
You're a good little boy,
you're gonna get him.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.854
You're gonna get him.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.524
Ahh!

14:17.557 --> 14:19.459
Son of a...

14:25.565 --> 14:27.534
Ahh!

14:29.536 --> 14:31.104
Nice try, asshole.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.772
We can resolve our issues.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.674
We don't need to resort
to over-the-top...

14:36.309 --> 14:37.544
Aah!

14:37.577 --> 14:39.279
I-I did it, Rick.
I got the tank!

14:39.312 --> 14:41.114
I-I'm a piece of shit,
but I got the tank!

14:41.148 --> 14:42.950
You're going in that tank,
motherfucker.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.617
You're gonna live in
that toxic shit wasteland

14:44.651 --> 14:45.651
like I had to do!

14:45.652 --> 14:47.020
Ahh!
Ow!

14:50.257 --> 14:52.937
Gunk Rick:
That's right, motherfucker
You're going in that fucking...

14:54.327 --> 14:55.795
Dads?

14:55.828 --> 14:57.297
Okay, just...
Just leave her out of it.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.631
What's going on?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.133
All right, fuck this.
Time for plan B...

15:00.167 --> 15:01.801
If I can't trap you
in a toxic world,

15:01.834 --> 15:06.073
I'll just make the whole world
toxic.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.440
It's okay, girls.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.642
I-I'm so sorry I put us in
danger with some of my behavior.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.112
I-If you'd like I can go out
in the g-garden,

15:12.145 --> 15:14.747
pick some fresh basil,
and make us a nice Scallopini.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.483
What did the booger version
of you mean

15:16.516 --> 15:19.219
when he said he was going
to make the whole world toxic?

15:19.252 --> 15:22.289
Believe me, sweetie, that man's
motivations are a mystery.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.224
Screw that, Rick.
We got to stop him.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.659
What's the last thing
you'd think about doing
with that tank thing?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.661
Morty, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

15:28.695 --> 15:30.297
but it's not our place,
you know,

15:30.330 --> 15:32.599
to pick and choose which world
gets saved from what apocalypse.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.502
Our... our toxins have as much
a right to their worldview as...

15:35.535 --> 15:37.804
Morty, how is it healthy
to slap me?

15:37.837 --> 15:39.072
Obviously my version of health

15:39.106 --> 15:40.807
is a hell of a lot different
from yours,

15:40.840 --> 15:42.075
you useless old turd.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.343
Wait. That's it.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.145
How could that detox machine
know the difference

15:45.178 --> 15:48.248
between healthy and sick for
everything that goes through it?

15:48.281 --> 15:49.682
It can't.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.584
It must be by the individual's
own definition of toxicity.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.186
That means...

15:53.220 --> 15:55.188
Dad!
What the...
What the hell, Rick?

15:55.222 --> 15:56.222
I'll explain on the way.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.824
Gunk Rick:
This "Moon Tower," Morty,

15:57.857 --> 15:59.959
is the perfect height
and metallic composition

15:59.993 --> 16:02.095
for the amplification
and beaming of toxic energies.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.463
What do you think about that,
Morty?

16:03.496 --> 16:04.964
Are you excited about that,
Morty?

16:04.998 --> 16:07.834
Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.
I-It's too high up here.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.302
Once I flip this switch,

16:09.336 --> 16:11.704
the entire world is gonna
be just as toxic as us, baby.

16:14.374 --> 16:18.378
**

16:18.411 --> 16:20.647
As we praise
our loving Father...

16:20.680 --> 16:23.683
God is a lie!
We made him up for money!

16:28.855 --> 16:31.124
Santa Claus isn't real.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.893
You were all mistakes!

16:33.926 --> 16:36.663
We fucking did it, Morty.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.031
Put your fucking hands
in the air.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.632
Yeah, you little piece of shit.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.501
Remember me?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.171
Didn't you learn last time
that you can't beat me?

16:44.204 --> 16:46.073
Yeah, I did. And then I learned
something else.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.840
- This.
- Ahh!!

16:47.874 --> 16:50.243
That bullet is laced with an
encrypted nanobotic virus

16:50.277 --> 16:52.979
that will disintegrate your
Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.181
You think I give a shit?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.748
I know you give a shit, dummy.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.883
Because I know I don't.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.251
Here's another thing I know...

16:58.285 --> 17:00.019
The decryption key
that neutralizes the virus.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.388
You want it?
Come and get it.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.156
Merge with me and you'll know
how to save him.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.857
Pfft. Come on, man.
I've been trapped

17:04.891 --> 17:06.593
in your pussy brain
for 70 years of delusions,

17:06.626 --> 17:09.596
but this is the all-time weakest
bluff that I've ever...

17:09.628 --> 17:11.531
Ow-Ohh!!
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

17:11.564 --> 17:13.433
He's cutting your time
in half. 10 minutes.
Ohh! It hurts!

17:13.465 --> 17:14.934
What is your problem?

17:14.967 --> 17:17.770
Oh, I had all my problems
removed... my entitlement,

17:17.804 --> 17:19.771
my narcissism,
my crippling loneliness,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.273
my irrational attachments.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.410
They must be somewhere.
They ain't over here, bro.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.777
I'm not going back in there!

17:24.810 --> 17:26.413
Honestly,
I don't care either way.

17:26.445 --> 17:27.847
I hate having you in me.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.182
And when I say "honestly"
you can believe it,

17:29.216 --> 17:30.950
because we both know
I'm too healthy to lie.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.452
Watch.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.421
All right! Knock it off!
You're not impressing anyone.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.456
Morty, not that I give
a shit, but are you okay?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.458
Jesus Christ, it hurts.
Relax, quit your bitching.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.727
Y-You're gonna be fine.
Grandpa's here.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.262
You think that's funny?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.297
Y-You got to have a sense
of humor about these things.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.732
Oh, wait, you can't.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.767
You're literally incapable
of seeing the bigger picture.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.369
I guess it's just funny
because you've never done

17:49.402 --> 17:51.138
anything but complain
about me being in charge,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.906
but if I ever gave you the wheel
we'd be dead in five minutes.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.609
- Rick?
- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.644
Rick?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.812
Ahh! Just do it!

17:59.846 --> 18:01.748
Just do it, you piece of...

18:03.316 --> 18:06.586
I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
Master of both worlds!

18:06.619 --> 18:07.887
Check it it out!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.422
"Excuse me."

18:09.456 --> 18:11.991
Now we'll just reverse
this hacky toxicity beam.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.826
Man, I really over think shit
when I'm angry.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.166
Oh, give it to me.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.568
Mm, ma-mah.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.437
God is not a lie.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.647
Mommy! Mommy!

18:34.681 --> 18:35.848
Ha! All right, Morty,

18:35.882 --> 18:37.684
now it's time we re-merge
your little ass.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.037
You're a better man
than me, Rick.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.353
I'm healthy
enough to admit that!

18:40.387 --> 18:43.022
That kid
is a real piece of shit.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.123
Y-Y-You're gonna save me,
right?

18:44.157 --> 18:46.293
Part of me wanted to,
Toxic Morty.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.629
Part of me really wanted to.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.765
I'm telling you,
these shares are hot. Yeah.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.034
That sounds like a good idea.
It's definitely a good idea.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.537
Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it,
now can you get me?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.038
Have I ever lied to you?

18:59.071 --> 19:02.475
That's right, and ask around,
I never do, Duane.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.876
Let me put this real simple.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.213
This stock is a beautiful
redhead, recently single,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.548
not looking to date
but ready to fall in love,

19:08.581 --> 19:11.618
and fate has put her locker
two down from yours, Duane...

19:11.651 --> 19:13.353
Two lockers down.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.388
So step up or step off, Duane.

19:15.422 --> 19:18.258
Blue pill or red pill,
what'll be, bro?

19:20.092 --> 19:21.861
Totally understand, Duane.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.530
You're the boss.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.964
Heinholz Biotech...

19:24.997 --> 19:26.899
Million and a half
at thirty-three.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.868
Heh.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.903
You little fucking monster.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.509
Mmm! Is this organic?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.044
Mmm!

19:38.077 --> 19:40.680
Go for Morty.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.515
Jessica:
Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.684
Look, can we just talk
for a minute?

19:44.717 --> 19:47.086
Is that how long it takes
for Rick to trace my location?

19:47.119 --> 19:49.489
Come back, Morty.
I miss you.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.523
You miss the old me.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.858
You miss someone
that loved you so much

19:51.891 --> 19:53.159
you never had to love 'em back.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.792
How do you know
I don't want to love you?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.096
Because I'm not sick.
Ex-girlfriend?

19:57.129 --> 19:59.666
Should I be jealous?
There's nothing to be
jealous of.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.034
I just realized that
I'm scheduled to speak
at that fundraiser

20:02.068 --> 20:03.603
on our date night.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.739
I can cancel.
We'll be together.
That's a date.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.441
You are the perfect man.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.110
Oh, sweetie, I think you hit
the wrong button.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.412
You didn't hang up.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.614
Huh. How 'bout that?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.120
Sorry, tiny American Psycho,

20:21.153 --> 20:23.290
time to take the opposite
of your medicine.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.293
Do what you got to do.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.228
Oh! Ow! Ahh!

20:29.262 --> 20:31.130
So, how do you feel, Morty?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.766
Ah, geez. I'm miserable.
Am I good or what?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.102
I guess it's worth it, though,
to know how much you care.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.805
Care? Me?
Morty, I'm fine with you.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.640
I only did this for him.
You lying bitch.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.276
She kept coming to our house,
Morty, and kept asking me

20:43.310 --> 20:45.445
"Did... did... d-did you get
a new Morty yet?"

20:45.478 --> 20:47.480
Because you kept drunk dialing
me and crying about it.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.715
I wasn't crying!

20:48.748 --> 20:50.049
Jacquelyn, I...

20:50.082 --> 20:51.751
I-I-I wasn't
who I said I was.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.220
You weren't a 14-year-old boy
from the Midwest

20:54.253 --> 20:56.423
who ran away from his family
and capitalized

20:56.456 --> 20:59.125
on his lack of conscience
by becoming a stock broker?

20:59.158 --> 21:01.328
Oh. I guess I was pretty
up front about that, wasn't I?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.095
You were up front
about everything.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.297
You were my soul mate.

21:04.331 --> 21:08.100
Well...
N... Not anymore. I'll, um...

21:08.134 --> 21:09.502
Y-You can keep the apartment,

21:09.536 --> 21:11.638
and... and... and,
uh... the drones.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.839
She can't keep the drones.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.106
They turn into
a little Voltron robot.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.174
They're awesome.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.511
You can't keep the drones.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.581
So, how was your date with Brad?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.650
It wasn't a date.
We were just having lunch.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.452
You guys are getting
back together, aren't you?

21:25.485 --> 21:26.853
Morty, I need your help
on an adventure.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.287
Eh, "need" is a strong word.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.357
We need door stops,
but a brick would work, too.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.525
Okay.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.861
Morty.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.563
Good to have you back.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.550
Have you ever been peed on
before?

21:39.566 --> 21:42.369
Oh, my God. Yum.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.772
* Hey, did you ever want to hold
a terrifold? *

21:45.805 --> 21:47.674
* I got one right here

21:47.707 --> 21:48.975
* Grab my terri-flap

21:49.008 --> 21:50.142
* Squeeze it

21:50.176 --> 21:51.378
* Grab it, squeeze it

21:51.411 --> 21:52.645
* Tug on my terri-flap

21:52.679 --> 21:55.114
* Hey, I want to take you to *

21:55.147 --> 21:56.716
* The terrifold dance

21:56.749 --> 21:59.852
* Wanna come with me?
You can grab my holdie-folds *

21:59.886 --> 22:01.854
* Squeeze 'em tight

22:01.888 --> 22:03.222
* You son of a bitch

22:03.255 --> 22:05.492
* Suck my holdie-flappy folds

22:05.525 --> 22:07.994
* Lick my flappy
foldie-holes *

22:08.027 --> 22:10.563
* My terri-flaps
in your mouth *

22:10.597 --> 22:13.299
* Suck my flaps,
you piece of shit *

22:13.332 --> 22:15.868
* Whoo

22:15.902 --> 22:18.571
Man: Although only a handful
of moon towers remain today,

22:18.605 --> 22:21.408
they were popular
in the late 19th century.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.910
An entire town could be
illuminated by...

22:23.943 --> 22:25.412
What the hell is this?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.815
Sea Cucumber!

22:28.848 --> 22:31.217
Sea Cucumber!!
