See, first,
you got to brush it, right?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.499
And then,
you just let them bake.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.935

Bruh, you ain't the only one

12:47.968 --> 12:49.236

I got to let them bake, baby.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.520

13:07.554 --> 13:10.357
So, can you double
any amount on any card,

13:10.390 --> 13:12.459
or does it have to be
something like Best Buy?

13:12.492 --> 13:15.362
Man, any store. See,
the mall got these gift cards

13:15.395 --> 13:16.596
for the entire place, man.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.298
I can even do those.

13:18.331 --> 13:22.269
Just give me the cash,
and I'll double it for you.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.603
Oh, you ready to rock?

13:23.636 --> 13:24.771

Hey, I wanted to see them.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.950
-Yeah, damn.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.220
Is there a limit on these?

13:40.253 --> 13:41.955
Nah, no limit.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.523
Matter of fact,

13:43.556 --> 13:45.492
I got to go get some stuff
from the mall, anyway.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.527
So, want to roll?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.229
Yeah, I'll roll.

SHAG: So, I pretty much stay

14:01.774 --> 14:04.878
The more exotic stuff like that
Skywalker depends, though.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.379
ALFRED:
Yeah, I feel you, man.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.881
Man, the ticket is right
on this, though.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.917
And I can cut you
a better deal depending on

14:09.950 --> 14:12.219
-Yeah, that makes sense, man.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.022
The MDMA shouldn't be a problem
as long as you let me know

14:15.055 --> 14:16.556
how much you want do
from, like, week to week.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.025

to these white folk?

16:40.867 --> 16:43.336
Um, I don't know.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.804
Probably don't call them

They got a no chase policy.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.607
They can't stop me.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.343
Most of these stores got it.
It's a liability thing.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.912
Even if they see me stealing,
they can't chase me.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.681

but, you know, we can set up
some meetings or whatever.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.253
ALFRED:

20:54.287 --> 20:56.222
-Nope. Nope.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.330
No, he didn't.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.798
-No, this nigga didn't.
Man, c...

21:13.440 --> 21:14.774
Oh.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.843
(car engine starts,
tires squeal)

21:24.216 --> 21:26.653
How you doing?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.327
You guys, um... take gift cards?

23:29.141 --> 23:30.743

Right in front of me,
he took a bunch of shoes.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.752
Said something about
a "no-chase policy."

23:39.786 --> 23:41.253
Oh, yeah, he's right about that.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.655
TV ADVERTISER: ...will not
protect or prevent injury...

23:42.689 --> 23:44.123
Well, I hope he's happy.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.493
-Almost got arrested.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.729
Smoke something, man.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.763
Where were you?

23:50.797 --> 23:52.765
I called you, like, six times.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.735
Yeah, um...

23:55.768 --> 23:57.436
I need a new phone.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.638

24:04.811 --> 24:06.178
* Haters gonna hate like uh
till they see me in the face *

24:06.212 --> 24:07.814

24:26.899 --> 24:29.435
Yeah.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.303
I mean, that might be
a big gap in my résumé,

24:31.337 --> 24:33.640
but, you know,
I think I could be

24:33.673 --> 24:35.074
a big help to this
organization here.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.491
How you doing?

24:52.525 --> 24:53.760
All right.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.830
I think that might be
my biggest weakness,

24:57.864 --> 24:59.298
because I love learning.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.533
-MAN: Mm.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.201
You cannot stop me
from learning.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.170
Like, every day I'm looking for
something new to learn.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.006
Well, I think you have
a lot of potential.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.007
TRACY:
Huh.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.676
Yeah. Yeah.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.848
Unfortunately...

25:15.882 --> 25:18.985
I don't think we'll be able to
offer you a job here right now.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.288
It... We're just fully staffed
at the moment.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.362
Man, fuck y'all.
