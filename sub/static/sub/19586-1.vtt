"The Way of the Samurai
is found in death."

03:07.412 --> 03:10.831
"Meditation on inevitable death
should be performed daily."

03:11.204 --> 03:13.747
"Every day when one's body
and mind are at peace..."

03:13.988 --> 03:15.867
"...one should meditate
upon being ripped apart..."

03:15.967 --> 03:19.358
"...by arrows, rifles,
spears and swords..."

03:19.577 --> 03:21.813
"...being carried away
by surging waves..."

03:21.945 --> 03:24.400
"...being thrown
into the midst of a great fire..."

03:24.531 --> 03:26.109
"...being struck by lightning..."

03:26.350 --> 03:28.981
"...being shaken to death
by a great earthquake..."

03:29.288 --> 03:32.817
"...falling from thousand-foot
cliffs, dying of disease..."

03:32.930 --> 03:36.017
"...or committing seppuku
at the death of one's master."

03:36.631 --> 03:41.453
"And every day without fail
one should consider hmself as dead."

03:42.242 --> 03:46.385
"This is the substance
of the Way of the Samurai."

10:18.987 --> 10:20.784
I'll get you
the rest tomorrow.

10:22.131 --> 10:23.546
No problem.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.670
'Listen, Frank...

11:16.770 --> 11:19.472
'Don't fuck around
with the boss's daughter.'

11:19.572 --> 11:22.231
'Don't break my balls,
Uncle Joe.'

11:22.331 --> 11:24.071
'Asshole, listen to me.

11:24.171 --> 11:27.552
'She's been in and out
of psychiatric hospitals.

11:27.652 --> 11:29.952
- 'She's a wacko.'
- 'Yeah, yeah...'

11:30.052 --> 11:32.992
'Vargo has put the
family money in her trust fund.'

11:33.092 --> 11:35.953
'I already know.'
'You'll get clipped.'

11:36.053 --> 11:38.193
Are you finished yet, Uncle Joe?

11:38.293 --> 11:41.513
- 'You'll get whacked!'
- I'm not fu...

11:41.613 --> 11:46.273
I'm not fucking dead yet, so
let's get off the goddamn phone.

11:46.373 --> 11:50.355
'Are you listening?
That girl's a fucking wacko.'

11:50.455 --> 11:53.674
'Yeah, I know.'
'Vargo's crazy about her.

11:53.774 --> 11:58.124
- 'You know what "crazy" means?'
- 'Yeah, I know, Uncle Joe.'

12:14.807 --> 12:17.046
Excuse me, Mr Vargo. Sonny...

12:17.207 --> 12:20.077
Louie Bonacelli's outside,
said you told him to come.

12:20.177 --> 12:22.677
Thanks, Angie.

12:22.777 --> 12:26.998
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- OK.

12:27.098 --> 12:30.279
- I almost hit the number.
- What did you play?

12:30.379 --> 12:33.678
I played my license plate
number. You know what?

12:33.778 --> 12:36.008
My fucking house-address number
came out!

12:40.249 --> 12:41.249
Hey...

12:43.042 --> 12:45.322
- Louie.
- What's up, Sonny?

12:50.810 --> 12:52.810
Come on,
let's take a walk.

12:54.353 --> 12:56.760
- Everything's set up?
- Yeah.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.411
It's going down tonight.
I'm using my special guy.

13:02.350 --> 13:03.468
What about the girl?

13:03.621 --> 13:07.055
Morini put her on the bus...
to the seashore.

13:07.175 --> 13:10.608
- Good.
- I don't feel good about it.

13:11.096 --> 13:14.886
Handsome Frank's a made guy
and all. A good soldier.

13:14.986 --> 13:19.056
- I feel a little bad.
- Forget about it.

13:19.176 --> 13:23.456
Handsome Frank fucked up. Pay
your respects at the funeral.

13:23.577 --> 13:24.919
Yeah...

13:54.180 --> 13:56.098
'Home in!'

13:56.228 --> 14:00.580
'One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.'

14:07.860 --> 14:09.861
Have some more wine, Louise.

14:11.461 --> 14:13.861
I don't want any more wine.

14:38.784 --> 14:40.575
What the fuck?

14:40.904 --> 14:44.389
What do you want? My Rolex?
Whatever...

15:03.612 --> 15:06.186
Did my father
send you here to do this?

15:12.819 --> 15:14.667
It's a good book.

15:19.482 --> 15:22.504
Ancient Japan
was a pretty strange place.

15:26.188 --> 15:28.115
You can have it.
I'm finished with it.

16:12.114 --> 16:14.513
I've got a bad feeling, Vin.

16:20.114 --> 16:24.464
First Valerio calls me in for
a sit-down with Vargo himself.

16:24.564 --> 16:26.395
And now the bird.

16:29.143 --> 16:33.194
Here, birdy-birdy.
Come here, you little fucker.

16:35.475 --> 16:38.146
Goddammit, this is ridiculous.

16:38.246 --> 16:40.995
I can't write this small.

16:43.316 --> 16:47.666
Can't we swag a fax
machine and get it to this guy?

16:47.766 --> 16:49.306
It ain't the Middle Ages.

16:49.406 --> 16:51.717
Come here, birdy.

16:54.917 --> 16:59.197
I got him, Louie! Louie,
I got him. I got the sucker.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.819
Little fucker, here we go.

17:03.951 --> 17:07.721
Easy now, Mr Chicken, easy.

17:14.398 --> 17:17.069
Mother of Jesus, Vin,
hold it still!

17:17.169 --> 17:19.199
I don't want to hurt him.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.480
- Ready?
- Yeah, OK.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.680
Go home,
little birdy, go home.

18:14.485 --> 18:16.485
'Shit! Shit!'

18:20.926 --> 18:23.886
'What's going on?
What's the problem here?'

21:07.022 --> 21:10.372
You little brat!
You want us to come up there?

21:10.472 --> 21:13.902
Fuck you!
Then you gonna get it!

21:16.223 --> 21:18.653
- You little prick!
- Eat me!

21:18.753 --> 21:20.253
Cocksucker.

21:20.353 --> 21:23.773
Hey, Louie. What the fuck
are you guys doing?

21:23.873 --> 21:28.303
His mother went to work and
locked him in. He's mad as hell.

21:32.424 --> 21:36.894
Vargo's waiting for us. You've
got bigger problems than this.

21:36.994 --> 21:41.225
Johnny, you said the girl was
on the fucking bus last night.

21:41.345 --> 21:44.375
- What happened?
- She was.

21:44.475 --> 21:46.896
I don't know what happened.
Let's go.

21:46.996 --> 21:48.946
Come on, Vin, let's go.

22:24.150 --> 22:27.510
- Ghost Dog!
- Knowledge to knowledge, baby.

22:53.913 --> 22:54.913
Shit!

23:27.516 --> 23:32.556
How you doin'? How are you?
They're inside, waiting for you.

23:36.157 --> 23:40.036
- Condolences on Handsome Frank.
- Thank you.

23:42.038 --> 23:46.318
- My thoughts are with you, Joe.
- They're waiting for you.

23:53.118 --> 23:56.108
- I'm sorry about Frank.
- Thank you.

23:56.208 --> 23:59.068
Sorry about your nephew, kid.

23:59.168 --> 24:02.668
They whacked him.
What are you gonna do?

24:02.768 --> 24:04.960
That's the way it goes.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.230
- Hey. Go in, they're waiting.
- Thanks.

24:20.330 --> 24:22.320
Louie, how's it going?

24:30.562 --> 24:33.593
I'm sorry we're late, Mr Vargo.

24:33.693 --> 24:36.642
Mr Bonacelli was...
delayed on his way over.

24:39.242 --> 24:40.969
Sit down.

24:49.523 --> 24:52.323
Johnny,
step outside, have a smoke.

24:52.564 --> 24:55.364
Sure, Sonny.
Mr Vargo.

25:01.645 --> 25:03.525
We got a big problem here.

25:03.645 --> 25:08.045
Seems like you're responsible.
Your mystery man fucked up.

25:08.165 --> 25:11.475
Morini told me
he put the girl...

25:11.575 --> 25:14.996
.. Mr Vargo's daughter,
on the bus.

25:15.096 --> 25:18.276
He did... but she got off and
went to Handsome Frank's house.

25:18.376 --> 25:23.396
You wanted Handsome Frank
whacked... So he got whacked.

25:23.496 --> 25:28.327
From outside. I set it all up.
No traces, no nothing.

25:31.768 --> 25:34.678
Morini said
that she was on the bus.

25:34.778 --> 25:38.968
Jesus, it's lucky
he didn't do her, too. Right?

25:40.328 --> 25:43.849
If he had,
you would be fucking dead.

25:46.249 --> 25:50.649
- This is not a good situation.
- Where is she? Is she OK?

25:50.850 --> 25:53.039
Don't worry
about Mr Vargo's daughter.

25:53.139 --> 25:56.640
We need to eliminate
the scumbag who whacked Frank.

25:56.740 --> 26:02.520
Frank was one of us. His killer
needs to be... neutralised.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.171
Erased from the planet.

26:05.850 --> 26:10.121
For the past four years, he's
done maybe 12 perfect contracts.

26:10.221 --> 26:12.562
Perfect. Like a ghost.

26:12.662 --> 26:16.122
He's valuable.
Totally untraceable.

26:16.222 --> 26:22.001
If he'd realised anyone would
be there, he'd have backed off.

26:22.101 --> 26:25.533
He sure didn't know
that she was gonna... be there.

26:25.653 --> 26:28.643
Louie, unless you wanna
be buried next to Frank,

26:28.743 --> 26:31.723
tell us everything about
this mysterious, ghostlike,

26:31.823 --> 26:34.174
untraceable
fuckin' button man.

26:35.134 --> 26:38.284
OK, OK. Er, let's see...

26:38.384 --> 26:41.405
I don't pay him by the job.

26:41.505 --> 26:46.575
He'll only work if I pay once a
year on the first day of autumn.

26:46.734 --> 26:50.854
First day of autumn, I settle up
for that past year, see?

26:54.855 --> 26:58.526
The first day of autumn...
OK, OK.

26:58.626 --> 27:02.206
Let's skip that part.
Where does he live?

27:02.306 --> 27:05.206
Fucked if I know.
That's the next strange thing.

27:05.306 --> 27:10.257
I can't call him. He contacts me
only through a bird.

27:12.657 --> 27:16.008
Since I first started
contracting stuff out to him,

27:16.108 --> 27:18.007
the bird comes every single day.

27:18.107 --> 27:20.529
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

27:20.629 --> 27:23.768
Did you say he contacts you
through a fucking bird?

27:23.868 --> 27:25.538
Did I just hear that?

27:27.540 --> 27:31.540
What particular
species... of bird?

27:33.139 --> 27:37.329
It's a pigeon. It must be
a carrier pigeon or whatever.

27:37.429 --> 27:43.411
Passenger pigeon!
They've been extinct since 1914!

27:43.511 --> 27:46.170
Am I fucking dreaming here
or what?

27:46.270 --> 27:51.610
OK, Louie, forget about
the bird. Let me ask you this.

27:51.710 --> 27:57.012
Tell me, what does
this mysterious guy look like?

27:57.112 --> 28:00.462
He's a big guy.
A big black guy.

28:01.782 --> 28:05.382
- He's what?
- He said the guy's a nigger!

28:06.983 --> 28:11.263
Maybe eight years ago,
I saw a guy, this guy.

28:11.383 --> 28:14.133
'He was a kid
in a bad situation.'

28:14.233 --> 28:16.743
Stupid-ass
motherfucker!

28:16.864 --> 28:18.695
Get his ass up here!

28:18.795 --> 28:20.534
You motherfucker!

28:20.634 --> 28:23.095
What's the problem here?

28:23.195 --> 28:28.464
'So I...
straightened things out.'

28:38.586 --> 28:43.266
Anyway, about four years ago,
this big guy comes to my door.

28:43.386 --> 28:46.936
This black guy, got a fucking
pigeon on his shoulder.

28:47.036 --> 28:50.656
Fuck knows how he found me,
but he said he owed me.

28:50.756 --> 28:56.978
I only saw him once after that
and we made this arrangement.

28:57.078 --> 28:59.218
That's very touching, Louie.

28:59.318 --> 29:02.698
Let me just backtrack
for a second.

29:02.798 --> 29:07.778
The bird comes to your house
every day. Did he come today?

29:07.878 --> 29:10.469
Yes, the bird
was there this morning.

29:10.589 --> 29:12.659
Did he have a message?

29:12.759 --> 29:16.539
The usual
"mission accomplished" message.

29:16.639 --> 29:20.350
Uh-huh. And did you
send a message back?

29:21.470 --> 29:22.470
No.

29:25.391 --> 29:29.741
You'd called me in, so I figured
it was best to leave it alone.

29:29.841 --> 29:31.551
Did you follow this bird?

29:33.151 --> 29:36.701
Put a bug on it?
Anything like that?

29:36.801 --> 29:41.952
No, I never had a reason
to do anything like that.

29:42.072 --> 29:47.152
I realise the arrangement I made
with this guy is pretty weird,

29:47.273 --> 29:50.943
but he's always
shown me complete respect.

29:51.043 --> 29:53.382
A whole new century
is coming,

29:53.482 --> 29:56.623
and Mr Vargo wants
every member of this family

29:56.723 --> 29:59.783
to make it a priority
to erase this weirdo.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.663
This guy is a professional.

30:02.763 --> 30:05.424
Going after him
could be dangerous.

30:05.524 --> 30:07.504
Handsome Frank was one of us,

30:07.604 --> 30:10.595
so we're gonna peel
this nigger's cap back.

30:14.275 --> 30:16.596
Better him than you, right?

30:21.275 --> 30:24.306
Now, what the fuck
is his name?

30:24.406 --> 30:27.277
- Ghost Dog.
- What?

30:28.477 --> 30:32.597
- Ghost Dog.
- Ghost Dog?

30:33.958 --> 30:38.308
- He said Ghost Dog!
- He calls himself Ghost Dog.

30:38.408 --> 30:42.627
A lot of these black guys,
gangster type guys,

30:42.727 --> 30:44.547
they all got names like that.

30:44.647 --> 30:48.709
- Is that true?
- He means like the rappers.

30:48.809 --> 30:52.309
The rappers got names
like that - Snoop Doggy Dogg,

30:52.409 --> 30:54.148
Ice Cube, Q-Tip, Method Man.

30:54.248 --> 30:56.950
My favourite was always
Flavor Flav from Public Enemy.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.759
He got the funky
fresh fly flava.

30:58.879 --> 31:01.680
"Live lyrics
from the bank of reality.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.950
"I kick da flyest dope manoeuvre
technicality, to a dope track."

31:05.050 --> 31:07.391
- I love that guy.
- I know nothing about that,

31:07.491 --> 31:10.031
but it makes me
think about Indians.

31:10.131 --> 31:14.671
They've got names
like Red Cloud, Crazy Horse,

31:14.771 --> 31:18.601
Running Bear, Black Elk...

31:24.603 --> 31:29.563
- That kind of shit.
- Indians, niggers... same thing!

31:33.150 --> 31:36.953
- Johnny!
- Sonny? Mr Vargo?

31:37.053 --> 31:40.433
Go outside. Get Sammy the Snake,
Joe Rags, Big Angie.

31:40.533 --> 31:42.839
- Get 'em in here.
- Right away.

33:41.976 --> 33:42.976
Yes!

34:55.183 --> 34:58.222
Hey! Peace, Dog!

35:33.227 --> 35:34.748
Is that your dog?

35:34.955 --> 35:40.107
No. I thought
maybe it was your dog.

35:50.574 --> 35:51.574
What?

35:53.308 --> 35:54.308
What?

35:55.330 --> 35:57.281
He's really staring at you.

35:58.092 --> 36:01.390
- Maybe he wants my ice cream.
- I don't think so.

36:14.430 --> 36:18.430
If he's bothering you,
why not tell him to go away?

36:20.312 --> 36:21.462
Go on.

36:26.031 --> 36:28.275
I've seen you before...

36:28.700 --> 36:31.363
'cause you always carry
that briefcase.

36:31.463 --> 36:35.214
You live on the roof
of the building down from me,

36:35.333 --> 36:37.883
where the birds
fly out from.

36:37.983 --> 36:42.830
Mom says you talk to nobody
and you got no friends.

36:43.773 --> 36:46.366
- I don't know your mom.
- Is it true?

36:47.082 --> 36:48.082
What?

36:48.332 --> 36:51.160
You never talk to nobody
and you got no friends.

36:51.795 --> 36:54.767
- No, I'm talking to you, right?
- Yeah.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.034
Right.

37:09.221 --> 37:11.457
You got your lunch
in that box?

37:12.071 --> 37:15.578
- What you got in the briefcase?
- I asked you first.

37:15.985 --> 37:19.008
No. Not my lunch.

37:19.108 --> 37:22.250
I got my books.
You wanna see?

37:22.439 --> 37:24.818
Books? Yeah, OK.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.439
"The Wind in the Willows".

37:31.426 --> 37:32.426
I read that.

37:32.741 --> 37:34.402
- You did?
- Yeah.

37:34.502 --> 37:37.772
Toad Hall and that stuff.
It was great.

37:38.973 --> 37:40.973
You did read it.

37:43.853 --> 37:45.853
"The Souls of Black Folk".

37:47.909 --> 37:50.869
I read that, too.
Where did you get that?

37:51.022 --> 37:53.499
From Ms Andrews, my teacher.

37:53.674 --> 37:57.604
I didn't read all of it,
but I plan to.

37:57.704 --> 37:59.494
You got time.

38:03.494 --> 38:04.694
"Night Nurse"?!

38:09.256 --> 38:13.424
- You read that?
- No, I just like the cover.

38:14.673 --> 38:15.901
Right...

38:18.991 --> 38:21.950
"Frankenstein".
That's a good book.

38:22.257 --> 38:26.287
- Yeah, better than the movie.
- You thought so, too?

38:26.387 --> 38:27.387
Yeah.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.777
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

38:34.859 --> 38:38.331
"He sprung from the cabin window

38:38.719 --> 38:42.818
"upon the ice raft,
which lay close to the vessel.

38:44.627 --> 38:48.627
"He was soon borne away
by the waves,

38:48.868 --> 38:51.761
"and lost in darkness...
and distance."

38:51.893 --> 38:55.926
Hey, that's the end!
Don't give away the ending.

38:56.460 --> 39:00.381
"The monster... Frankenstein."

39:14.207 --> 39:17.911
"Rashomon". What's this about?

39:18.303 --> 39:20.029
Pearline?

39:20.702 --> 39:22.580
You can borrow that.

39:23.031 --> 39:26.053
You just gotta promise
that when you read it,

39:26.153 --> 39:28.414
you come tell me
what you think.

39:28.514 --> 39:29.857
OK, I will.

39:33.665 --> 39:36.985
Is it true you got
no friends, then?

39:38.584 --> 39:42.987
No. My best friend's
right over there.

39:43.552 --> 39:47.218
- You wanna meet my best friend?
- I don't see anybody.

39:47.612 --> 39:50.221
He's there
in that ice cream truck.

39:50.433 --> 39:52.544
What do you think, I'm a chump?

39:52.794 --> 39:55.586
I'm not going there.
I hardly know you.

39:56.731 --> 39:58.186
Whatever.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.780
Well, all right.

40:04.644 --> 40:06.307
Pearline,
where are you going?

40:06.468 --> 40:09.619
I'm going to get ice cream.
I'm coming right back.

40:33.391 --> 40:37.220
This is my best friend, Raymond.
Raymond, this is...

40:37.320 --> 40:39.190
- Pearline, right?
- Yeah.

40:45.671 --> 40:47.871
My best friend.

40:58.472 --> 41:01.342
Well, OK. Thanks.

41:01.442 --> 41:03.743
Chocolate's my favourite.

41:03.843 --> 41:06.113
Yeah. Me, too.

41:15.194 --> 41:19.274
- What language is he talking?
- French.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.874
- He only speaks French.
- Do you understand French?

41:22.995 --> 41:26.715
No. I never understand
a word he says.

41:30.115 --> 41:33.275
- And that's your best friend?
- Yeah.

41:44.877 --> 41:48.397
- Bears?
- Yes! Bravo!

42:18.600 --> 42:22.199
- What's he talking about?
- Bears, I guess.

42:25.367 --> 42:30.121
I gotta go. I got
some business to take care of.

42:39.803 --> 42:41.682
For the ice cream.

42:46.723 --> 42:50.722
That book, read it and tell me
what you think, OK?

42:50.883 --> 42:52.274
- OK.
- OK.

42:52.374 --> 42:54.484
Take it easy, Raymond.

43:44.889 --> 43:47.758
That fucking thing loaded?

43:47.858 --> 43:50.610
- Yeah, OK.
- Come on, let's do it.

43:50.729 --> 43:51.880
Ready?

43:55.809 --> 43:59.139
That could be him right there.
Should I shoot him?

43:59.337 --> 44:01.961
No, that ain't him.
Vargo said it was a black guy.

44:02.061 --> 44:04.331
So, what's he?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

44:04.491 --> 44:08.490
- I think he's an Indian.
- What the hell are you?

44:14.331 --> 44:15.331
Cayuga.

44:16.611 --> 44:19.411
Cayuga? What the fuck
is Cayuga?

44:19.532 --> 44:21.962
Puerto Rican,
indian, nigger... same thing.

44:22.062 --> 44:24.762
We should
waste him to be sure.

44:24.862 --> 44:29.932
It ain't authorised, so let's
go. I wanna get the right guy.

44:38.214 --> 44:40.734
- Stupid fucking white man.
- What?

44:41.934 --> 44:44.444
I said stupid fucking white man.

44:44.544 --> 44:47.604
You red nigger-looking
Sitting Bullshit motherfucker!

44:47.704 --> 44:50.686
Sam, you're losing control.
Let's get out of here.

44:50.786 --> 44:51.925
Cayuga, my ass!

44:52.025 --> 44:55.295
You better learn to keep
your fucking mouth shut,

44:55.536 --> 44:59.695
or I'll blow your fucking brains
out myself. You dumb fuck!

47:09.428 --> 47:13.548
Hey, what the heck
is going on, fellas?

47:19.950 --> 47:21.949
What? What?

47:26.910 --> 47:30.911
Ah, shit!
I don't think that's him.

47:31.150 --> 47:35.100
- How the hell do you know?
- It doesn't feel right.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.905
Now he's got his own wings,
he can fly with his pigeons.

47:39.059 --> 47:42.631
Vargo said, if he even looks
like him, shoot him, right?

47:42.763 --> 47:47.300
I know. Let's go. I gotta take
care of something for Sonny.

49:27.522 --> 49:30.722
Fuck. I knew
that was gonna be you.

49:40.724 --> 49:44.514
You gonna kill me?
You might as well kill me.

49:44.614 --> 49:47.753
I'm your retainer.
I follow a code.

49:47.853 --> 49:50.954
I've always
given you my respect.

49:51.054 --> 49:54.915
That's why you've got that
big fucking gun to my head?

49:55.015 --> 49:59.525
Forgive me. I don't
mean you no disrespect.

49:59.645 --> 50:03.525
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Called me for a meeting.

50:03.766 --> 50:04.766
Yeah.

50:07.366 --> 50:11.316
Everything seems
to be changing all around us.

50:11.416 --> 50:13.367
You can say that again.

50:15.367 --> 50:19.527
When you did that guy the other
night, was a girl there?

50:19.646 --> 50:21.597
I wasn't instructed
to eliminate her.

50:21.697 --> 50:24.998
I know,
it's just that...

50:25.098 --> 50:29.048
things have gotten
all complicated now.

50:32.449 --> 50:34.678
They're gonna whack you,
Ghost Dog.

50:34.778 --> 50:38.279
If they don't find you,
they're gonna whack me instead.

50:38.379 --> 50:41.398
- Probably whack me anyways.
- Ray Vargo?

50:41.498 --> 50:43.479
The whole family's
looking for you.

50:43.579 --> 50:48.279
- The underboss, Valerio, too?
- Of course. He pulls all the...

50:48.379 --> 50:53.129
Hey... How the fuck do you know
so much about our organisation?

50:53.250 --> 50:55.651
- Who was the girl?
- She's...

50:55.771 --> 50:59.321
Forget about her,
I can't talk about that.

50:59.421 --> 51:03.002
I'm warning you
that they're gonna kill you.

51:03.102 --> 51:07.321
- Maybe me, too.
- Better me than you, Louie.

51:07.421 --> 51:11.481
Well... Right now,
I'd have to agree with that.

51:11.581 --> 51:14.683
Hey, Louie!
Sorry I'm late...

51:14.783 --> 51:17.932
and I'm real sorry
about this.

51:21.253 --> 51:24.923
Jesus Christ!
You just shot Morini.

51:25.023 --> 51:27.884
Valerio's fucking
brother-in-law!

51:27.984 --> 51:30.733
- He was gonna shoot you.
- What?

51:31.775 --> 51:34.574
See if he's dead.

51:45.135 --> 51:47.656
I don't think
he's getting any older.

51:47.776 --> 51:49.535
Roll him over.

51:59.858 --> 52:02.657
Now you really better shoot me.

52:03.937 --> 52:07.377
There's no way
I'm gonna explain this.

52:09.138 --> 52:12.015
Fuckin' Morini!

52:12.226 --> 52:15.889
OK, shoot me.
Go ahead, kill me now.

52:15.989 --> 52:20.009
I'm your retainer. It's against
the code of the samurai.

52:20.109 --> 52:23.329
If you're my retainer,
whatever that is,

52:23.429 --> 52:25.729
then do what I tell you!

52:25.829 --> 52:26.829
Oww!

52:31.685 --> 52:34.581
- What did you that for?
- You told me to.

52:36.660 --> 52:38.580
I don't
mean you no disrespect.

52:40.581 --> 52:44.581
Now you've got an excuse.
Tell them I attacked you both.

52:46.982 --> 52:50.532
You better watch your back,
Ghost Dog!

52:50.632 --> 52:56.262
Like you said, everything
seems to be changing around us.

53:01.943 --> 53:04.183
Nothing makes sense any more.

53:25.145 --> 53:27.785
I'm gonna take your knight.

53:52.268 --> 53:55.388
Talking about ice cream?

54:57.675 --> 54:59.675
It's amazing.

55:01.394 --> 55:05.794
How the hell is he
gonna get it down from here?

55:23.157 --> 55:24.157
Ah...

55:36.999 --> 55:40.308
I gotta go.
I got business to take care of.

55:40.408 --> 55:42.359
The sun's coming down.

58:52.098 --> 58:53.098
Yeah.

58:56.298 --> 58:59.817
There is something
you could do for me.

59:01.099 --> 59:02.099
Yeah.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.120
'And now,
my newest invention.'

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:21.750
'I can turn diamonds...
into jelly beans!

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.671
'But do you think I'm happy?

01:00:25.771 --> 01:00:31.551
'No! I'm frustrated, frustrated,
frustrated, frustrated!

01:00:31.651 --> 01:00:36.873
'You ask why? Felix the Cat
and his bag of tricks.

01:00:36.973 --> 01:00:41.832
- 'It's magic!'
- 'I'll make a canoe.'

01:00:41.932 --> 01:00:43.883
'Magic and more magic!'

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:57.674
I thought
we discussed this yesterday.

01:00:57.774 --> 01:01:00.005
All I want is my money.

01:01:00.125 --> 01:01:04.235
There's people here. We
can discuss this another time.

01:01:04.335 --> 01:01:08.596
Every time
I have to come get my rent.

01:01:08.696 --> 01:01:10.686
It's every three months.

01:01:10.806 --> 01:01:13.806
'I'll try to
get the bag like this!'

01:01:20.207 --> 01:01:22.477
'It tickles!'

01:01:22.577 --> 01:01:25.207
Sanchez,
I've got bigger problems.

01:01:25.327 --> 01:01:27.087
I'll clear it up tomorrow.

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:30.688
Pay me that money
or I'll call the City Marshal.

01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:32.792
Three months rent!

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.000
What kind of operation are
you guys running here anyway?

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.249
What? What?

01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:21.020
I don't think the boss
buys your story, either.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:25.531
Morini was family.
He was also my brother-in-law.

01:02:25.631 --> 01:02:30.052
Sonny, I'm sad about
what happened, but I got shot!

01:02:30.152 --> 01:02:32.292
You think
I'm making this up?

01:02:32.392 --> 01:02:36.022
I don't know
what I fucking believe!

01:02:43.543 --> 01:02:47.493
Joe, Snake. Go to the garage,
get some cars.

01:02:47.593 --> 01:02:50.344
First thing tomorrow,
take Mr Vargo

01:02:50.503 --> 01:02:52.338
to his castle in the woods.

01:02:52.755 --> 01:02:55.648
- Right now?
- No, next fucking week!

01:02:55.779 --> 01:02:57.718
Let's go!

01:03:04.025 --> 01:03:06.225
Passenger pigeon!

01:03:06.893 --> 01:03:09.501
Somebody grab
the goddamn thing!

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.030
- Grab him, Vinny.
- Yeah.

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.391
I got him. Here you go.

01:03:17.491 --> 01:03:20.231
Get out
with that flying rat.

01:03:20.331 --> 01:03:22.061
Just get the message off him.

01:03:27.162 --> 01:03:28.615
Send him home, Vinny.

01:03:46.764 --> 01:03:51.035
It says, "If a samurai's head
were to be suddenly cut off,

01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:55.114
"he should still be able
to perform one more action...

01:03:55.214 --> 01:03:57.505
"with certainty."

01:03:59.763 --> 01:04:02.305
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

01:04:03.599 --> 01:04:05.067
It's poetry.

01:04:05.454 --> 01:04:08.206
The poetry of war.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.470
Excuse me, excuse me!

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:41.000
Step into
the alley, please!

01:08:36.607 --> 01:08:37.658
OK!

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:52.294
Plan B.

01:13:35.936 --> 01:13:38.966
Hello, I'm Bob Solo.
I'm with West Side Realty.

01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:41.606
I have an appointment
with Mr Vargo.

01:13:41.706 --> 01:13:44.246
How did you
get in the gate, Mr Solo?

01:13:44.346 --> 01:13:46.807
Mr Valerio gave me the code.

01:13:46.907 --> 01:13:50.647
It's very important. I may have
a buyer for the estate.

01:13:50.747 --> 01:13:53.807
Go inside, Sammy.
Check this out.

01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:56.978
I'll stay here
with our Mr Solo.

01:13:59.578 --> 01:14:01.728
Mind if I stretch my legs?

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:05.089
No, you stay in the car,
Mr Solo.

01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:06.189
OK.

01:14:09.939 --> 01:14:12.979
Why don't I
give you my card?

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.860
Jeez...

01:14:19.579 --> 01:14:21.460
You sonofa...

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.741
Sonofabitch!

01:15:06.065 --> 01:15:08.727
Jesus, it's the fucking birdman!

01:15:08.836 --> 01:15:10.853
Ah, Jesus...

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.220
I've been expecting you.

01:16:06.742 --> 01:16:08.743
It's you again.

01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:14.104
You borrowed my book.

01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:45.256
Goddammit! You shot me in
the same place as last time.

01:16:45.356 --> 01:16:49.098
I'm your retainer.
I don't mean you no disrespect.

01:16:49.885 --> 01:16:52.907
Besides, I don't want
to put too many holes in you.

01:16:55.606 --> 01:16:57.747
Where's Sonny Valerio, Louie?

01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:10.665
I'll see you later, Louie.

01:17:15.356 --> 01:17:18.534
Vinny? Vinny?

01:17:19.981 --> 01:17:22.239
I'm in here, Louie.

01:17:57.434 --> 01:17:58.434
Wow!

01:17:59.402 --> 01:18:01.782
That's
a big bear you killed there.

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:06.692
Yep. The fucker
weighs about 300 pounds.

01:18:07.161 --> 01:18:08.161
Yeah.

01:18:09.163 --> 01:18:13.684
It's funny. I didn't even know
it was bear-hunting season.

01:18:14.714 --> 01:18:18.090
What are you, a game warden?
Some kinda Fed?

01:18:18.375 --> 01:18:23.116
No, no. I'm just asking,
you know, just asking.

01:18:24.008 --> 01:18:25.068
Well, I'll tell ya.

01:18:26.156 --> 01:18:30.785
There aren't too many of these
big black fuckers left here.

01:18:30.885 --> 01:18:35.954
So when you get a clear shot
at it, you sure as hell take it.

01:18:36.765 --> 01:18:38.558
That's why you shoot 'em...

01:18:40.075 --> 01:18:41.916
.. 'cause there're not
that many left?

01:18:43.626 --> 01:18:46.235
I don't think
I understand your question.

01:18:48.536 --> 01:18:51.239
You know, there ain't that many
coloured people here, neither.

01:18:51.934 --> 01:18:54.937
You oughta get back in your car
and go about your own business.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.639
Yeah... maybe you're right.

01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:12.840
Jesus Christ,
you fucking hit my knee!

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.637
You know, in ancient cultures...

01:19:17.141 --> 01:19:19.553
bears were considered
equal with men.

01:19:20.648 --> 01:19:24.322
This ain't no
ancient culture here, mister.

01:19:26.722 --> 01:19:28.452
Sometimes it is.

01:19:59.126 --> 01:20:00.565
'Aaaahh...'

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.601
You know, Louie...

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.041
There's one good thing
about this Ghost Dog guy.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.979
What's that, Vin?

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:17.661
He's sending us out
in the old way.

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:21.322
Like real fucking gangsters.

01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:26.921
Hang on, Vin. You're gonna
make it. Just hang in there.

01:20:34.693 --> 01:20:38.403
Oh, Christ! Fucking five-o.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.950
Remain inside the vehicle.

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:01.470
When you're in the city,
you never see a cop,

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:04.750
but here, they're like
the fucking Gestapo!

01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:08.121
Like we're in some
fucking foreign country!

01:21:10.921 --> 01:21:14.071
My friend has to get
to a hospital.

01:21:14.171 --> 01:21:16.202
What happened to your arm?

01:21:16.322 --> 01:21:18.311
I'm fine, it's my friend here.

01:21:18.411 --> 01:21:20.752
License
and registration, please.

01:21:20.852 --> 01:21:22.352
We don't have time!

01:21:22.452 --> 01:21:26.802
Don't push me, mister!
Remain inside the vehicle.

01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:34.003
Oh, yeah...
This is terrific.

01:21:44.046 --> 01:21:45.931
What's the situation here, sir?

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:53.187
Let's get the fuck
out of here, Louie!

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:12.150
Jesus, Vin! You just
iced a woman, you know that?

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.431
You know what you are, Louie?

01:22:14.531 --> 01:22:17.751
You're a fucking
male chauvinist pig.

01:22:17.851 --> 01:22:21.471
What do you mean,
I'm a male chauvinist pig?

01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:24.791
- You just shot a broad!
- A cop!

01:22:24.891 --> 01:22:27.392
I just shot a cop.

01:22:27.492 --> 01:22:31.321
They wanna be equal...
I made her equal.

01:22:45.004 --> 01:22:46.004
Vin?

01:22:49.003 --> 01:22:52.004
Hey, Vin!
You with me over there?

01:22:53.244 --> 01:22:55.738
Oh, no. No...

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:34.608
Hey, Raymond.

01:23:38.528 --> 01:23:41.031
I ain't seen you
in a while, man.

01:23:54.402 --> 01:23:57.120
That little girl, Pearline?

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:06.107
She probably wanted
to give me that book back.

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:09.505
I wonder what she
thought about it. Hey, man...

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.962
It's a little big,
but one of those Haitian tailors

01:24:13.062 --> 01:24:15.332
can cut up,
fit it for you.

01:24:19.533 --> 01:24:22.013
Yeah, that's for you.

01:26:19.024 --> 01:26:20.751
Hi, guys!

01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:06.469
My fucking Jaguar! Shit! Fuck!

01:27:09.269 --> 01:27:11.670
You got a phone? Oh, man.

01:30:23.569 --> 01:30:24.569
Shit!

01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:51.958
Shit!

01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:03.704
What the fuck?

01:34:11.285 --> 01:34:13.521
Ghost Dog.
Power and equality.

01:34:13.630 --> 01:34:15.471
Always see everything,
my brother.

01:34:51.195 --> 01:34:53.874
Raymond! Raymond, man. Hey.

01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:58.565
You look worried.

01:35:14.677 --> 01:35:17.548
Don't worry, man. It's OK.

01:35:18.227 --> 01:35:23.077
It's all right. I need to get
inside the truck, all right?

01:35:23.225 --> 01:35:25.478
Let me get in the truck.

01:36:00.861 --> 01:36:02.746
Turn around, man.

01:36:03.513 --> 01:36:06.407
Turn around, turn around.

01:36:39.264 --> 01:36:42.637
No, no... No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

01:36:43.253 --> 01:36:45.325
Here, I wanna give you this.

01:36:49.327 --> 01:36:51.977
I don't want
you to worry, Raymond.

01:36:52.614 --> 01:36:55.134
Don't you worry about nothing.

01:36:55.607 --> 01:36:58.356
Everything happens for a reason.

01:37:00.287 --> 01:37:04.287
You know that guy who was here,
with his arm in a sling?

01:37:07.343 --> 01:37:10.688
Yeah... I know that guy.

01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:13.008
He's name's Louie.

01:37:14.609 --> 01:37:16.264
I'm his retainer.

01:37:18.697 --> 01:37:20.473
See, once, a long time ago,

01:37:21.371 --> 01:37:23.998
he helped me out.

01:37:24.265 --> 01:37:26.084
You motherfucker!

01:37:26.216 --> 01:37:28.846
What's going on?
What's the problem here?

01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:32.945
'And I owed him for that.

01:37:36.131 --> 01:37:40.883
'See, a samurai must ALWAYS
stay loyal to his boss.

01:37:41.603 --> 01:37:43.211
'No matter what happens.'

01:37:44.812 --> 01:37:50.941
Anyway, me and him, we're
from different ancient tribes.

01:37:51.259 --> 01:37:55.332
And now,
we're both almost extinct.

01:38:00.293 --> 01:38:02.054
Sometimes...

01:38:03.369 --> 01:38:05.892
you gotta stick
with the ancient ways.

01:38:08.134 --> 01:38:09.894
The old-school ways.

01:38:12.934 --> 01:38:15.493
I know you understand me.

01:38:17.215 --> 01:38:19.495
I know you understand me.

01:38:22.295 --> 01:38:25.494
Hello?
Anyone home in there?

01:38:33.706 --> 01:38:38.217
No, but thank you.
I'm not really hungry.

01:38:39.817 --> 01:38:42.886
Ghost Dog,
I brought your book back.

01:38:42.986 --> 01:38:46.538
I finished it a few days ago,
but I didn't see you.

01:38:48.297 --> 01:38:50.490
What did you think?

01:38:50.737 --> 01:38:53.368
I liked
all six different stories.

01:38:53.468 --> 01:38:56.488
Ancient Japan
was a pretty weird place.

01:38:56.588 --> 01:38:59.409
But I especially
liked the first story.

01:38:59.509 --> 01:39:05.099
It's one story, but each person
sees a totally different story.

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:08.208
- That was really good.
- "Yabu No Naka".

01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:10.005
That's my favourite, too.

01:39:11.473 --> 01:39:13.771
Well, thank you
for returning it,

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.140
and thank you for your comments.

01:39:19.014 --> 01:39:21.403
- Will you do me a favour?
- What?

01:39:26.489 --> 01:39:30.301
Take this book...
and you read it some time.

01:39:31.743 --> 01:39:33.722
You don't gotta read it
right away.

01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:37.865
OK. Is it good?

01:39:39.502 --> 01:39:43.422
Yeah, well... I liked it a lot.

01:39:46.824 --> 01:39:49.570
It's not exactly a story,
it's kind of a...

01:39:50.074 --> 01:39:51.609
Ghost Dog!

01:39:59.083 --> 01:40:00.683
You should go home now.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.900
What is this, Louie?

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.836
"High Noon"?

01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:35.864
This is
the final shoot-out scene?

01:40:38.642 --> 01:40:40.160
I guess it is.

01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:42.552
Yeah...

01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:45.377
Well, it's very dramatic.

01:40:48.051 --> 01:40:51.842
It's very
dramatic... and I understand.

01:40:53.203 --> 01:40:57.323
You have to avenge the death
of your bosses, right?

01:41:05.604 --> 01:41:07.204
Well, OK, then.

01:41:30.005 --> 01:41:31.046
Stay back!

01:41:36.713 --> 01:41:38.007
Raymond! Stay back.

01:42:08.452 --> 01:42:11.412
Now you're gonna be the boss
of your own clan, right, Louie?

01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:17.812
'Cause... there ain't
nobody else left...

01:42:18.531 --> 01:42:20.157
Ain't that right, Louie?

01:42:21.531 --> 01:42:23.577
No, not exactly, Ghost Dog.

01:42:37.101 --> 01:42:38.263
Stay there!

01:42:47.272 --> 01:42:50.814
It's like you said,
better you than me, right?

01:42:53.055 --> 01:42:55.360
Nothing makes
any sense any more.

01:42:56.702 --> 01:42:58.319
It's OK, Louie.

01:43:01.914 --> 01:43:04.194
I've seen everything
I need to see.

01:43:09.761 --> 01:43:12.817
Do me one favour, though.
One favour.

01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:15.416
What do you want me to do?

01:43:17.937 --> 01:43:19.384
You take this book...

01:43:21.116 --> 01:43:25.281
and read it some time.
Then, later on...

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:28.415
you can tell me what you think.

01:43:29.858 --> 01:43:32.448
Yeah... sure.

01:44:32.837 --> 01:44:34.963
Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

01:44:36.848 --> 01:44:38.536
This is my book.

01:44:38.755 --> 01:44:42.963
No, Miss Vargo, I got it
from the guy, from Ghost Dog!

01:44:45.002 --> 01:44:46.580
Can we get out of here?

01:44:46.755 --> 01:44:48.926
It takes place in ancient Japan.

01:44:53.346 --> 01:44:54.734
You should read it.

01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:13.673
We can go now.

01:46:05.228 --> 01:46:07.595
Pearline,
you're in the way, honey.

01:46:09.677 --> 01:46:12.286
Why don't you go in the other
room to read your book, darling?
