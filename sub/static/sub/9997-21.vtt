00:01.859 --> 00:04.200
Barney - stop digging under that fence.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.449
I said, stop that...

00:07.450 --> 00:09.129
You're not leaving the pen.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.759
But I have to...

00:10.760 --> 00:13.120
I'm meeting Mr. Squirrel by the big tree.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.430
Barney, you know I don't like
you going into the woods.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.480
Nothing good ever
happens at the big tree.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.120
You have to stay in the
pen with the rest of us.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.200
That's the way the humans want it.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.450
Oh, Mom! If that were true,

00:25.510 --> 00:27.290
they would have fixed
this hole in the fence.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.509
Barney! Where do you think
you're going, young man?

00:30.510 --> 00:31.560
Get back here!

00:32.369 --> 00:34.010
Mr. Squirrel, I'm here!

00:35.260 --> 00:36.260
Mr. Squirrel?

00:38.040 --> 00:38.760
Mr. Squirrel,

00:38.810 --> 00:40.330
are you playing hide-and-seek?

00:40.810 --> 00:43.560
Okay, ready or not, here I come!

00:45.570 --> 00:47.240
Oh, what's that?

00:48.980 --> 00:49.680
What?

00:50.540 --> 00:51.480
What's going on?

01:00.490 --> 01:02.070
Mommy!

01:06.940 --> 01:08.050
You okay?

01:09.360 --> 01:11.390
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:12.770 --> 01:14.040
That was weird.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.260
It's past midnight.
It's officially your birthday.

01:20.470 --> 01:22.040
Mmm, oh, yes.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.490
Be still, my heart.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.530
Oh, don't be that way,
birthday boy.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.230
Come on, you want me to
sing you a little song?

01:31.790 --> 01:33.390
Want me to light you
a birthday candle

01:33.440 --> 01:35.120
so you can make a special wish?

01:35.320 --> 01:36.720
I already made one.

01:37.990 --> 01:38.990
Really? What is it?

01:44.210 --> 01:46.660
Come on. Aren't you gonna
tell me what it is?

01:46.750 --> 01:50.970
No. The longer you keep me awake,

01:51.040 --> 01:53.540
the longer it doesn't come true.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.130
Pretty cool,
huh? I had to cut out,

02:48.131 --> 02:49.700
like, 50 pictures of Dad to do it,

02:49.750 --> 02:51.540
but, you know, I really
think he's gonna love it.

02:51.750 --> 02:55.600
How often do you get to be the
star in your own comic book?

02:55.830 --> 02:57.180
I think it's much cooler

02:57.240 --> 02:58.850
than some boring sweater.

02:59.590 --> 03:00.900
For your information,

03:01.100 --> 03:03.310
Dad actually wanted the
sweater for his birthday.

03:03.410 --> 03:06.020
Which reminds me,
Mom wanted me to give you this,

03:06.070 --> 03:07.370
so you could wrap
it before tonight.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.930
It's what she got you to give Dad.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.230
Ties are boring.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.390
You're right.
Ties are kind of boring.

03:12.930 --> 03:15.390
But not as boring as a sweater.

03:15.790 --> 03:16.860
But close.

03:17.220 --> 03:18.570
Are we all out of tissues?

03:18.770 --> 03:20.460
Uh, yeah, there's a box in here.

03:23.790 --> 03:25.430
Mom had to go in to work early,

03:25.480 --> 03:27.000
so I guess I'm driving
you to school.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.320
Actually, no.
I'm driving you to work.

03:30.550 --> 03:32.170
Mom promised that I
could use her car

03:32.220 --> 03:33.650
to go off campus for lunch today,

03:33.850 --> 03:35.400
but since she had to leave early,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.610
uh... consider it an
early birthday gift.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.479
Your very own chauffeur-
I'll drive you to your office;

03:41.480 --> 03:43.020
I'll pick you up when
you're done tonight.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.880
You can even ride in the backseat.

03:45.090 --> 03:45.730
Wait a second.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.210
You know this means
that you have to take me

03:47.250 --> 03:49.630
to the comic book store
after school, right?

03:49.990 --> 03:50.850
Have to?

03:50.980 --> 03:53.070
Come on, it's Wednesday.
Mom always takes me

03:53.110 --> 03:55.220
to the comic book store on
Wednesday 'cause that's when

03:55.270 --> 03:56.740
all the new comics come out.

03:57.090 --> 03:58.570
Well, can't it wait
until tomorrow?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.340
Hey, you wouldn't
want me to get there

04:00.390 --> 04:02.440
after all the cool stuff
is gone, would you?

04:02.710 --> 04:04.170
Yeah, you wouldn't
want her to get there

04:04.210 --> 04:06.550
after all the cool stuff is gone.
Okay. Fine.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.660
We'll go to the comic book store.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.680
But if you're not
done in 15 minutes,

04:10.720 --> 04:12.160
Marie and I are leaving you there.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.150
I can think of worse
places to live.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.140
Sounds like you're driving.

04:18.940 --> 04:19.829
Yay.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.570
I'm thinking I'm not the only one

05:15.610 --> 05:17.300
the principal wants to see
in his office this morning.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.880
Did you hear that? Hear what?

05:20.550 --> 05:21.460
Never mind.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.770
Are either of you
familiar with SARC?

05:26.210 --> 05:27.910
Yeah, some kind of
animal rights group?

05:28.050 --> 05:29.670
Southwest Animal Rights Coalition.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.600
That girl whose picture
you're staring at,

05:31.660 --> 05:32.660
she's been working for them since

05:32.710 --> 05:34.290
she graduated college last year.

05:34.630 --> 05:36.760
Her name's Melissa Treynet,
and apparently,

05:36.810 --> 05:39.190
she was doing some
kind of undercover work

05:39.260 --> 05:42.120
at the AgroUnited Factory
Farm on the outskirts of town,

05:42.570 --> 05:43.570
and now she's gone missing.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.640
No one's heard from
her for a week.

05:46.150 --> 05:49.080
SARC thinks that AgroUnited
found out what Melissa was up to

05:49.130 --> 05:51.650
and that she may be the
victim of foul play.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.690
They want to file a
missing persons report,

05:53.770 --> 05:56.470
go to the media, talk about
what a big, bad company

05:56.520 --> 05:57.800
AgroUnited is.

05:57.860 --> 05:59.300
Meanwhile, AgroUnited is saying

05:59.340 --> 06:00.460
if something happened
to this girl,

06:00.500 --> 06:02.610
it has nothing to do with them.
Wait a second.

06:02.670 --> 06:05.080
What does this have to do with
the district attorney's office?

06:05.230 --> 06:07.100
AgroUnited employs
several hundred people,

06:07.220 --> 06:08.300
and at least up until now,

06:08.360 --> 06:10.280
they've always been
good corporate citizens.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.340
The mayor called,
asked me to get involved

06:13.390 --> 06:15.050
in figuring out
where this girl is,

06:15.100 --> 06:16.180
what might have happened to her,

06:16.230 --> 06:19.220
and maybe help keep all
of this out of the papers.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.910
To that end,
I have the head of SARC.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.170
And the farm's manager waiting
in the conference room.

06:24.230 --> 06:26.160
So... shall we?

06:27.410 --> 06:28.740
Mr. Ruettiger's
farm processes pork

06:28.790 --> 06:30.520
on a massive scale.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.210
Last month, my organization
was made aware of rumors

06:34.300 --> 06:36.240
that in order to
meet their quotas,

06:36.480 --> 06:40.720
AgroUnited was circumventing
animal cruelty statutes

06:40.770 --> 06:42.110
and housing livestock

06:42.170 --> 06:44.740
in unsafe and inhumane conditions.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.910
So, yes, we had
Melissa apply for work

06:47.960 --> 06:49.430
in the hope that she
would get a job,

06:49.640 --> 06:50.960
and then she could document

06:51.020 --> 06:52.990
whatever infractions took place.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.810
And did she find anything? No.

06:55.410 --> 06:56.570
She didn't find anything.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.100
Would you like to know why?

06:58.750 --> 07:00.570
Because there was nothing to find.

07:01.530 --> 07:03.700
Our animals are all treated

07:03.860 --> 07:04.500
very well.

07:04.570 --> 07:06.530
Absolutely everything we do

07:06.590 --> 07:09.350
is up to or exceeds
the code. Now...

07:11.040 --> 07:14.850
I am very sorry if
you and your people

07:14.920 --> 07:17.200
have a problem with me and mine,
but you know what?

07:17.760 --> 07:18.860
We're a business.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.720
We provide jobs for
hundreds of people.

07:21.760 --> 07:27.100
We provide a product that 97%
of the country actually want.

07:28.270 --> 07:29.290
Now, look...

07:30.230 --> 07:33.320
I feel... very badly

07:33.720 --> 07:34.880
about this young woman,

07:35.390 --> 07:37.210
but rest assured, wherever she is,

07:37.260 --> 07:40.130
whatever happened to her,
it had nothing to do with us.

07:41.010 --> 07:43.900
I really don't know how
you could be so certain.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.180
Just last year,

07:46.570 --> 07:49.170
one of our operatives was
caught by his coworkers

07:49.230 --> 07:50.990
while videotaping at a farm,

07:51.050 --> 07:54.250
and they beat him within
an inch of his life.

07:54.310 --> 07:55.890
That has nothing to do with me;

07:55.950 --> 07:57.640
That has nothing
to do with my farm.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.630
So you say.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.480
You know what? I'm done here.

08:02.630 --> 08:04.890
Mr. Ruettiger, please... Mr.
Devalos, with respect,

08:04.930 --> 08:07.750
there is only so much slander
I can take in one day.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.030
If you want to have your
people visit my farm,

08:11.090 --> 08:12.590
if you want to talk
to my employees,

08:12.660 --> 08:13.610
you feel free--

08:14.230 --> 08:15.850
you don't even have
to get a warrant--

08:16.260 --> 08:21.390
but I will not sit here and
listen to one more word

08:21.450 --> 08:22.420
of this woman's nonsense.

08:22.470 --> 08:23.680
I do not have the time.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.910
Some of us actually have
to work for a living.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.730
I am inclined to want to
call a press conference.

08:35.570 --> 08:36.530
I think it is time

08:36.580 --> 08:38.960
to make people aware of
Melissa's disappearance,

08:39.030 --> 08:41.549
to make people aware
that all is not right

08:41.600 --> 08:44.220
with AgroUnited,
and that, in fact,

08:44.310 --> 08:47.490
people may be putting their lives
in peril by eating their food.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.080
Don't you think that's a
bit premature, Victoria?

08:50.140 --> 08:51.810
For one thing,
we can't even be sure

08:51.870 --> 08:54.520
that Melissa was a victim
of foul play at this point.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.060
It's not like you were
paying her a fortune;

08:56.130 --> 08:57.430
Who's to say she didn't
just meet some guy

08:57.490 --> 08:58.950
and take off for parts unknown?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.980
If you hold a press conference

09:02.050 --> 09:02.900
and Melissa pops up

09:02.960 --> 09:04.200
from out of nowhere the next day,

09:04.250 --> 09:07.350
then you and your organization
are gonna look awfully foolish.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.480
Let us do our work.

09:08.540 --> 09:10.480
Let us go to the farm,
talk to the people there.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.750
If we don't come up with
some tangible results

09:12.810 --> 09:13.920
in a couple of days,

09:14.050 --> 09:16.440
then, yeah, by all means,
talk to the press.

09:17.510 --> 09:18.430
What do you say, Victoria?

09:22.150 --> 09:26.430
Aaaaa

09:27.720 --> 09:29.210
Oh, yeah. Whew!

09:29.860 --> 09:30.840
We're makin' bacon now.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.350
Thank you.

09:57.350 --> 09:58.570
If the Animal Rights Coalition

09:58.620 --> 10:00.420
really wants to get people
to stop eating meat,

10:00.460 --> 10:01.870
they should try
bottling that smell.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.140
What's going on?
What are you looking at?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.120
Hold the jokes.
I think I recognize that pig.

10:16.610 --> 10:17.290
Excuse me?

10:19.370 --> 10:21.000
That pig-- I think I know him.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.450
So, listen,
if I'm sticking my nose

10:24.500 --> 10:26.060
somewhere it doesn't belong,
just say so,

10:26.100 --> 10:28.560
but am I allowed to ask where
and when you first met this pig?

10:29.950 --> 10:31.340
In bed, the other night.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.370
You happy?

10:36.540 --> 10:38.530
Hey. What's he doing?

10:39.050 --> 10:40.290
I don't know. He's your friend.

10:43.550 --> 10:44.790
Hey, I think he's
making a break for it.

10:45.350 --> 10:46.890
Come on. What do we do?

10:47.050 --> 10:48.170
Or are we supposed
to call someone?

10:48.340 --> 10:49.420
I don't know. Who do you call?

10:50.370 --> 10:51.260
I think we should follow him.

10:51.990 --> 10:52.770
If you say so.

10:56.270 --> 10:57.060
Barney!

10:57.340 --> 10:58.960
Oh, he's got a name,
and you know what it is.

10:59.120 --> 10:59.930
I'm not gonna ask.

11:01.060 --> 11:01.880
Barney!

11:02.130 --> 11:02.860
Hey, Barney!

11:13.600 --> 11:14.820
Okay.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.240
We caught up to him.
Now what do we do?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.240
Who picks him up?
Who carries him home?

11:23.800 --> 11:24.630
Wait a second.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.330
Lee, I think I know this tree.

11:29.740 --> 11:31.350
Well, you know the tree;
You know the pig.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.500
I'm starting to think you
got this whole other life

11:33.550 --> 11:34.500
you don't tell me about.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.310
Shh.

11:49.350 --> 11:52.630
Lee... I think you
need to call Forensics.

11:53.570 --> 11:54.350
I don't think

11:54.440 --> 11:55.640
Melissa Treynet is missing.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.250
I think she may be dead.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.020
Whoa!

12:00.120 --> 12:01.370
Check me out!

12:01.910 --> 12:04.310
I haven't been able to lift
a whole car over my head

12:04.350 --> 12:05.900
since, what, college?

12:08.340 --> 12:11.450
So, you like it? Oh, my God,
I love it, especially that cape.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.280
I think that's a really
good look for me.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.640
Almost as good a look
as my new sweater.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.990
Well, not so fast.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.290
There's one more present,
isn't there, Marie?

12:20.130 --> 12:20.820
Good!

12:21.460 --> 12:22.120
Come on.

12:22.330 --> 12:23.310
Thank you.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.240
Hey, what's that?

12:26.340 --> 12:27.670
I thought you gave
her the tie to wrap.

12:27.850 --> 12:28.870
I... did.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.050
I don't know what's in there.

12:31.470 --> 12:33.190
More birthday presents.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.700
You got Daddy a toy?

12:37.410 --> 12:39.540
Wow, Marie,
that really is something.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.920
Oh, my God,

12:40.990 --> 12:42.040
it's an Axion!

12:44.150 --> 12:46.630
Tell me you don't remember
this from when we were kids.

12:46.830 --> 12:47.890
I had one in the first grade.

12:47.940 --> 12:49.350
All the kids my age had one.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.050
Come on, Axion!

12:52.620 --> 12:55.610
Axion, the Galactic Guardian!
Wait a second.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.540
You had that when you
were a kid, right?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.880
So wouldn't that kind
of make it an antique?

13:02.910 --> 13:04.930
Antique is probably
pushing it a little bit,

13:05.010 --> 13:07.210
but collectible, yes, absolutely.

13:07.350 --> 13:09.369
I think they stopped making these in,
like, the '70s.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.460
Where did you find this?

13:10.540 --> 13:13.460
The comic book store-
Ariel took us after school.

13:14.150 --> 13:14.750
That's funny.

13:14.810 --> 13:17.130
I don't remember seeing you buy
anything when we were there.

13:17.710 --> 13:19.200
Yeah, me-me, neither.

13:21.070 --> 13:22.220
Wasn't it expensive?

13:22.370 --> 13:23.030
No.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.760
Marie, sweetie,
how did you pay for this?

13:38.700 --> 13:39.880
Hey, this is Danny

13:39.940 --> 13:42.460
from Masked Menace
Comics and Collectibles.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.550
We're closed right now,

13:43.630 --> 13:45.480
but please leave a
message at the beep.

13:45.940 --> 13:47.010
Excelsior!

13:48.490 --> 13:49.430
Hi, Danny.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.320
Uh, my name is Joe Dubois.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.950
My six-year-old was
in your store today,

13:54.060 --> 13:58.550
and she, uh, unintentionally
walked out with an old toy

13:58.870 --> 14:00.230
that you had on display.

14:00.890 --> 14:04.080
Uh, so just in case you
realize you're missing

14:04.140 --> 14:05.760
a certain galactic guardian,

14:05.820 --> 14:07.070
I want you to know that he's safe

14:07.140 --> 14:09.780
and we'll be returning
him to you tomorrow.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.150
Uh, and for what it's worth,

14:12.200 --> 14:14.370
I'm-I'm incredibly
sorry about this.

14:16.910 --> 14:17.860
My youngest child

14:17.900 --> 14:18.850
is a shoplifter.

14:18.930 --> 14:19.950
Happy birthday to me.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.860
Come on, we talked to her.
You saw her face.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.350
She knows what she did was wrong.

14:24.790 --> 14:26.980
All she wanted to do was
give her daddy something nice

14:27.020 --> 14:27.990
for his birthday.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.000
But besides the petty larceny,
didn't you have a nice birthday?

14:36.040 --> 14:38.210
What? You didn't
have a nice birthday?

14:38.390 --> 14:40.780
Well... What?

14:41.100 --> 14:44.170
Every other birthday you always
make the special lamb chops.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.040
Tonight you made veggie lasagna.

14:48.750 --> 14:49.580
Well... I just thought we could do

14:49.630 --> 14:51.220
with a little less
meat around here.

14:51.530 --> 14:53.250
Well, okay, but on my birthday?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.180
They screamed at me.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.080
Who screamed at you?

15:01.350 --> 15:02.180
The lamb chops--

15:02.240 --> 15:04.030
when I took them out of the
freezer this afternoon,

15:04.080 --> 15:05.170
they screamed at me.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.730
It's a long story.

15:08.680 --> 15:09.640
I'm sure it is.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.060
Hello?

15:16.420 --> 15:18.400
Sorry to call so late,
but I thought you'd want to know.

15:18.450 --> 15:21.200
I got Forensics out here poking
around your friend, the tree,

15:21.310 --> 15:23.360
and they did find some
blood and bone matter.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.240
They did?

15:24.470 --> 15:26.520
Yeah, but no one on my end's
getting terribly excited.

15:26.580 --> 15:27.530
You know, they reminded me

15:27.580 --> 15:30.390
it is next to a farm,
a slaughterhouse, technically,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.930
so it wouldn't be
surprising to find all kinds

15:31.980 --> 15:33.620
of bone and blood in the soil

15:33.790 --> 15:36.140
that isn't necessarily
human. Plus,

15:36.270 --> 15:38.050
you got wildlife in the woods.

15:39.210 --> 15:41.340
I don't know, Allison.
No one's holding out a lot of hope.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.850
They are gonna analyze
whatever it is they found?

15:44.180 --> 15:44.950
Sure, they are.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.730
Oh, yeah, and, uh, by the way,

15:46.790 --> 15:48.670
uh, your other friend, uh, Corky?

15:48.940 --> 15:49.750
Barney!

15:51.500 --> 15:53.340
Well, he's back in his pen,
safe and sound,

15:54.070 --> 15:54.860
probably dreaming of the day

15:54.910 --> 15:56.210
he grows up and
becomes a pork chop.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.540
That's not funny.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.170
Well, hey,
look at the bright side:

15:59.220 --> 16:00.670
For the moment, we have to assume

16:00.710 --> 16:02.050
this girl is still alive
and well somewhere.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.040
And you and me, we get
to go back to square one.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.180
BARNEY: No, Mom!

16:08.580 --> 16:09.520
No!

16:11.010 --> 16:13.500
There, there, son, it's all right.

16:13.610 --> 16:15.630
There's nothing to be upset about.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.700
But, Mother, I don't understand.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.470
What are you doing out there?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.320
Why are you in that cage?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.390
Are the humans
taking you somewhere?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.870
Don't be afraid, Barney.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.340
It's just my time.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.190
What do you mean, your time?

16:29.450 --> 16:32.350
My time-- that's
the way life works.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.380
You live, and then the humans
take you, and it's over.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.480
Barney, stop looking so sad.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.350
You need to be brave.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.300
But I don't want to be brave.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.510
I want you here,

16:43.660 --> 16:46.100
with me forever!

16:47.470 --> 16:49.399
Mother, please don't go!

16:49.400 --> 16:50.800
Don't leave me!

16:50.870 --> 16:52.560
I'm afraid, Mother!

16:52.690 --> 16:54.340
I'm afraid!

16:55.110 --> 16:59.350
No! Mom, don't leave! Stop!

17:03.330 --> 17:04.700
Hey, uh... you all right?

17:06.060 --> 17:07.030
Allison, what's wrong?

17:08.260 --> 17:10.810
I think I'm supposed
to save a pig.

17:22.430 --> 17:24.569
Aaaa

17:25.030 --> 17:25.869
Ms. Gossett.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.750
Wow, you have quite
an operation here.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.270
Yeah, well, thank you.

17:30.370 --> 17:31.370
I'm very proud of it.

17:31.860 --> 17:35.070
Believe it or not, most of
this is funded by donations.

17:35.190 --> 17:37.880
A lot of people really believe
in what we're trying to do.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.340
So, what brings you by?
Some news about Melissa?

17:41.990 --> 17:43.190
No. Sorry.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.660
Soon, I hope.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.470
Actually, I was hoping to ask
your advice about something.

17:50.350 --> 17:51.890
So you want to save a pig?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.830
Not all pigs-- just this one pig.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.960
Do you mind if I ask you why?

18:00.240 --> 18:01.620
It's hard to explain.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.460
I-I just have this very
powerful connection to him.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.810
I know that sounds crazy, right?

18:10.060 --> 18:12.410
I mean, I just feel like I
have to get him out of there

18:12.500 --> 18:13.640
before it's too late.

18:15.030 --> 18:17.320
What would I even do
with him once I got him?

18:17.390 --> 18:19.750
I can't just set him
loose in my backyard.

18:25.140 --> 18:25.830
I'm sorry.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.090
You know what, you're-you're...

18:28.150 --> 18:30.030
You're busy with a lot of things.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.690
I'm sorry that I bothered you...

18:31.750 --> 18:34.200
You are not bothering me,
Mrs. Dubois.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.490
I'm worried about Melissa,
but I have a job to do.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.410
And nobody would understand
that better than her.

18:49.510 --> 18:51.640
You know, if you did get that pig,

18:52.260 --> 18:55.130
I could help you place him
in a livestock rescue farm.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.870
They're very humane.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.230
The animals are very well treated.

19:00.380 --> 19:04.390
The problem is,
how do we get the pig.

19:07.060 --> 19:08.440
You know what I would
do if I were you?

19:09.270 --> 19:11.000
I would try to speak a language

19:11.040 --> 19:13.320
that those AgroUnited
people understand.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.210
Offer them money.

19:15.950 --> 19:16.840
What do you mean?

19:17.180 --> 19:19.230
You think they'd
actually sell him to me?

19:19.650 --> 19:21.940
They make a profit on every
pig that they slaughter.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.090
I say figure out how
much the animal is worth,

19:24.140 --> 19:26.350
and then you just offer
a little bit more.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.670
That way, everybody wins.

19:31.970 --> 19:32.650
Hello?

19:32.850 --> 19:34.660
Melissa Treynet, our missing girl,

19:34.720 --> 19:36.240
turns out her passion
for lost causes

19:36.300 --> 19:38.460
wasn't limited to the
work she did with animals.

19:38.540 --> 19:39.280
What does that mean?

19:39.910 --> 19:41.560
Her boyfriend's a
recovering addict.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.290
Did a stint for
possession back in '08.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.770
SARC hired him for
a couple of months

19:45.810 --> 19:46.830
after he got out of prison.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.340
That's where he and Melissa met.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.380
Do you think he might
have had something to do

19:50.410 --> 19:51.670
with her disappearance?

19:51.830 --> 19:52.940
I'm not sure,
but he certainly seems

19:52.980 --> 19:54.190
like a good place to start.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.770
You know, I've been clean
going on three years.

19:58.150 --> 19:59.250
I just think you should know that.

20:00.270 --> 20:01.810
Okay. I got it.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.760
Now let's talk about
your girlfriend.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.550
According to her mother,

20:05.590 --> 20:07.630
you and Melissa hadn't
been getting along so well.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.120
No, no, that's not true.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.180
Melissa and I had sort of
an on-again/off-again thing.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.320
That's all. Her mom
doesn't really get that.

20:15.780 --> 20:16.850
What about lately?

20:17.020 --> 20:18.530
Were you on? Were you off?

20:19.400 --> 20:20.360
Good question.

20:21.060 --> 20:22.280
Have to ask Melissa.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.710
Ever since she started working
the night shift at that farm...

20:26.220 --> 20:27.350
I don't know.

20:27.780 --> 20:29.460
Can you be on with someone
who's never around?

20:30.370 --> 20:31.370
The last time I saw her

20:31.420 --> 20:32.780
was the night before
she started there.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.220
Where were you the
night she disappeared?

20:37.150 --> 20:38.980
Does anyone even know
what night that was?

20:40.150 --> 20:43.240
I mean, like I said, once she
went undercover at that farm,

20:43.280 --> 20:45.020
I wasn't in regular
contact with her.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.500
How about a week ago Tuesday?

20:47.540 --> 20:48.700
She was supposed to have
dinner with her mother

20:48.730 --> 20:49.660
and never showed up.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.270
Where were you that night?

20:52.450 --> 20:53.420
Tending bar.

20:53.910 --> 20:55.080
I work at a club downtown.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.610
You're a recovering addict,
you work at bar?

21:00.420 --> 21:02.150
Well, how about after work?
Where'd you go then?

21:02.770 --> 21:04.980
Home. Bed.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.000
Alone.

21:13.440 --> 21:19.810
Aaaa

21:27.350 --> 21:29.640
Look, I get why you're
asking these questions. I do,

21:29.940 --> 21:31.470
and-and I would love
to help if I could,

21:31.550 --> 21:33.790
but the truth is,
I have no idea where Melissa is.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.200
Who was on that DVD?

21:36.490 --> 21:38.470
She sent you a DVD, didn't she?

21:39.070 --> 21:41.310
She brought a camera
into that farm,

21:41.510 --> 21:43.820
looking for evidence
of animal abuse.

21:43.950 --> 21:45.360
That was the whole point,
wasn't it?

21:46.140 --> 21:47.920
Well, I'm guessing she
must have found some.

21:48.210 --> 21:50.300
Why else would she
send you that disk?

21:52.850 --> 21:53.960
Okay, here's the thing.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.440
I don't know anything
about any DVD,

21:56.910 --> 21:59.250
and I'm sorry, but, like I said,

21:59.290 --> 22:01.560
I haven't heard from Melissa
since she started working there.

22:02.260 --> 22:03.170
Now, I would love to help,

22:03.220 --> 22:05.010
but I'm as mystified
by all this as you are.

22:06.060 --> 22:06.660
The guy's story

22:06.700 --> 22:08.520
stinks worse than
that farm yesterday.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.030
What was that DVD you
were asking about?

22:11.180 --> 22:12.560
Just something I saw in there.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.070
Melissa must have sent it to him.

22:14.130 --> 22:14.990
You know, I'm starting to think

22:15.030 --> 22:17.390
that Victoria was right all along.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.550
What is somebody from
that farm harmed Melissa

22:19.580 --> 22:21.150
'cause she found something
that was incriminating?

22:22.220 --> 22:23.520
Well, okay, let's say she did.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.970
If Shane Carnahan had video
like that in his possession,

22:26.010 --> 22:27.230
why wouldn't he
just show it to us?

22:27.260 --> 22:28.390
He's got to know he's a suspect.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.540
Why not point us in a
different direction?

22:31.930 --> 22:33.810
Look on the bright
side: we got a suspect.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.170
I think we'll have more
luck finding Melissa Treynet

22:36.220 --> 22:38.160
if we investigate one guy
instead of, you know,

22:38.210 --> 22:39.170
a whole industry.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.600
I'm sorry, and I'll
never do it again.

22:51.270 --> 22:54.860
You know, sir, we have a
very strict policy here

22:54.920 --> 22:57.090
in regards to shoplifters.

22:57.230 --> 22:58.900
We let the police handle them.

23:01.690 --> 23:03.620
Sweetie, would you mind
just waiting for me

23:03.660 --> 23:04.740
right over there by the door?

23:08.510 --> 23:09.980
Look, she made a mistake.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.870
She apologized; she brought
back your merchandise.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.060
Don't you think maybe we can
leave the police out of this?

23:17.890 --> 23:19.430
I mention she's six?

23:20.840 --> 23:22.790
The Axion is damaged, sir.

23:23.290 --> 23:24.000
Excuse me?

23:24.190 --> 23:25.130
This figure.

23:25.650 --> 23:29.160
When she took it, it was marked "
Very fine condition."

23:29.210 --> 23:30.730
Now I'd barely call it "Good."

23:30.990 --> 23:32.470
The joints are loose now,

23:32.860 --> 23:36.880
and there's a small crack
on the back of his left leg.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.850
The joints are, what,
35 years old?

23:40.040 --> 23:43.540
All I'm saying is, sir,
I can't sell this,

23:43.750 --> 23:45.750
not in this condition.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.840
Not to any serious collector.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.780
All right, fine,
if it'll end this,

23:50.820 --> 23:53.420
I'll buy the Axion,
for whatever you say it's worth

23:53.460 --> 23:55.300
before the joints were loosened.

23:55.410 --> 23:58.600
Fair enough. You can make
that check out for $350.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.600
Or... if you'd like,
we could just, uh,

24:03.650 --> 24:06.110
turn the whole matter
over to the authorities.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.110
Hello?

24:11.190 --> 24:11.970
Yeah, in here.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.360
Hey, I thought you were
taking that thing back.

24:17.470 --> 24:20.110
Yeah, I tried, but the
previous owner wouldn't take it

24:20.150 --> 24:22.500
in its new and
not-so-improved condition.

24:22.580 --> 24:26.790
Ended up having to cut
the guy a check for $350.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.330
It was either that or let

24:28.380 --> 24:30.180
the police take Marie
away in handcuffs.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.760
I'm still not sure I
made the right decision.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.490
Yeah, you know, it's a...

24:33.590 --> 24:35.340
It's a really good
birthday present.

24:35.570 --> 24:37.120
Yeah, it brings
back some memories.

24:38.090 --> 24:40.100
The only thing missing
is the nail polish.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.900
Nail polish? Yeah, my mom used
to write my name in nail polish

24:43.950 --> 24:45.460
on all my toys so no
one could take them

24:45.500 --> 24:46.900
and claim they were theirs.

24:47.830 --> 24:48.660
What are you doing?

24:48.700 --> 24:50.480
Just checking to see if
you have some nail polish.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.090
I wouldn't want
someone to take you

24:52.140 --> 24:53.310
and say you belonged to them.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.280
So what kept you?

24:55.700 --> 24:57.770
I got your message
about missing dinner,

24:57.990 --> 24:59.000
but you didn't say why.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.610
You know that farm
I was at yesterday?

25:02.270 --> 25:04.060
The one where that
missing girl worked?

25:04.690 --> 25:06.560
I went by there tonight after work

25:06.610 --> 25:08.660
to take care of a little
personal business.

25:10.850 --> 25:13.940
This guy... was only the
second most expensive

25:13.990 --> 25:15.230
impulse buy of the day.

25:16.130 --> 25:18.270
$500 for a pig?!

25:18.330 --> 25:19.460
I know. It's a lot!

25:19.610 --> 25:20.750
I had to get him out of there.

25:21.350 --> 25:23.610
Honey, think about everything
that he's been through.

25:23.680 --> 25:26.240
He witnessed a murder.
He lost his mother.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.270
Allison, he's a pig!

25:28.650 --> 25:30.680
Where is he? He's not
in the garage, is he?

25:31.070 --> 25:32.230
Those guys eat anything.

25:32.270 --> 25:34.240
I've got a lot of
important stuff out there.

25:34.740 --> 25:36.130
Backyard?

25:36.230 --> 25:38.110
No, he's with the
animal rights people.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.250
We're working on finding
him a permanent home.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.150
Great, $500-- we don't even
have anything to show for it.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.350
Okay, now you want
him in the garage?

25:46.170 --> 25:47.240
You know, a few months ago,

25:47.270 --> 25:49.010
we were shopping for
things for the girls

25:49.080 --> 25:51.200
and I saw that necklace in
the jewelry store window,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.740
and you said, "Get it.
You never get anything for yourself."

25:53.770 --> 25:55.290
So, you got yourself a toy today.

25:55.370 --> 25:56.610
I got myself a pig.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.580
Ain't life great?

25:58.400 --> 26:00.510
You're right.
Use it in good health.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.640
You sure you don't want me to put

26:01.680 --> 26:03.280
some nail polish on
the little oinker?

26:04.370 --> 26:06.160
You were supposed to get
here 20 minutes ago.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.890
Look, I don't know what
kind of game you're playing,

26:07.930 --> 26:10.129
but I'm ready for you.
I'm not going to let you

26:10.130 --> 26:11.280
do to me whatever
you did to Melissa.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.250
Listen, this is the last
message I'm going to leave you.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.370
Get over here with my $50,000

26:16.420 --> 26:18.430
or I'm taking her video and
putting it up on the Web.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.710
Who's out there?

26:51.810 --> 26:52.780
Nice.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.520
Well, I can't find any blood.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.480
No spent cartridge.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.710
Well, maybe the killer

27:11.750 --> 27:14.140
cleaned up before he left.
Oh, maybe.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.110
Look, I know what you
saw in your dreams.

27:17.490 --> 27:18.390
I know that you believe

27:18.450 --> 27:21.160
that Melissa Treynet and
Shane Carnahan were killed,

27:21.700 --> 27:23.810
but at the moment,
that's a tough buy, Allison.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.620
We don't have any bodies.
We don't have any evidence.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.540
If you play this thing
strictly by the books,

27:28.620 --> 27:31.300
you kind of have to conclude
that we don't have any murders.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.200
Oh, come on, Lee.

27:32.260 --> 27:34.300
We know something's
going on at that farm.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.210
Whatever it is, Melissa taped it

27:36.250 --> 27:37.750
and she's dead now because of it.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.450
And now, so is Shane Carnahan.

27:39.510 --> 27:42.000
Maybe or maybe he's just off
getting stoned somewhere.

27:42.540 --> 27:44.740
Or maybe, uh, we spooked him
yesterday and he took off.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.300
Or maybe he decided he
didn't want to be around

27:46.350 --> 27:47.590
if we found a way to connect him

27:47.630 --> 27:49.640
to his girlfriend's disappearance.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.120
You've got to admit,
that's a lot of maybes.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.550
He cleans it pretty good, huh?

27:59.551 --> 28:01.650
There you go, Barney.
You're hungry.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.710
Barney, huh?

28:02.790 --> 28:04.940
Wow, I didn't realize the
fella had a name already.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.960
I'll be sure to pass
that along to the people

28:07.000 --> 28:08.960
from the rescue farm
when they come get him.

28:09.430 --> 28:10.940
Speaking of which,

28:11.210 --> 28:12.970
I should get him back
to the holding pen.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.070
So he's ready. Let's go.

28:15.350 --> 28:17.340
Barney, let's go. Come on.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.130
Bye.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.490
Bye, Barney.

28:21.060 --> 28:21.920
Is this thing on?

28:22.130 --> 28:23.620
Testing, one, two?

28:24.300 --> 28:27.560
So, here's the video report
you've been waiting for.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.010
Hi, Victoria. This is Melissa.

28:30.070 --> 28:33.630
Thank you for letting me waste
the last three weeks of my life.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.420
Uh, well, it's March 23.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.780
13 in the morning and
I just finished up

28:38.820 --> 28:42.920
my 19th day of employment here,

28:43.080 --> 28:45.060
and I am pleased to report

28:45.100 --> 28:47.260
that all of the rumors
of animal cruelty

28:47.290 --> 28:49.770
seem to be utterly unfounded.

28:50.610 --> 28:52.510
Are the people who run this place

28:52.560 --> 28:55.220
turning innocent
animals into food?

28:55.340 --> 28:56.680
Yes. Of course.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.390
But they're doing it in accordance

28:58.450 --> 29:00.870
with all of the state's
animal cruelty statutes.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.270
So, I'm pulling the plug.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.380
I'm going in tomorrow
and I am quitting.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.870
There's just nothing to see here.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.570
Mrs. Dubois?

29:13.610 --> 29:14.970
Was there something about Melissa?

29:19.630 --> 29:21.780
Uh... they were just
talking about the weather.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.030
But I promise you,
as soon as I hear something,

29:25.910 --> 29:27.640
you'll be one of the
first people that I call.

29:33.870 --> 29:34.560
Hello?

29:34.740 --> 29:36.670
You and me have a problem, sir.

29:38.020 --> 29:38.810
Who is this?

29:38.890 --> 29:40.080
This is Daniel Watson

29:40.110 --> 29:43.190
from Masked Menace
Comics and Collectibles.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.180
I'm missing my Sultar.
I beg your pardon?

29:46.400 --> 29:47.460
Sultar.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.640
As in Sultar the Cosmic Cavalier.

29:50.740 --> 29:53.620
Blue body armor,
about 12 inches high.

29:53.660 --> 29:56.800
He had two big yellow swords
and a button on his back

29:56.840 --> 29:58.880
that made him walk
when you pressed it.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.180
Yeah, no. I know what a Sultar is.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.530
I had one when I was a kid.

30:02.770 --> 30:04.960
Yeah? I had one.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.230
Yesterday.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.170
In a display case
by my front door.

30:09.670 --> 30:12.620
Right up until your
daughter took it.

30:12.890 --> 30:15.170
Took it? My daughter?

30:15.930 --> 30:17.060
Is this some kind of joke?

30:17.470 --> 30:21.040
Uh, I'm looking at the
security tape right now, sir.

30:21.430 --> 30:24.320
I'm watching her put the Sultar

30:24.370 --> 30:26.420
into her backpack.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.980
You know what? No, that's insane.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.480
I don't know what your problem is.

30:29.510 --> 30:31.020
I don't know what you're
trying to pull here,

30:31.290 --> 30:32.440
but my daughter's not
going to do that.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.440
She's not going to walk
into a store with her father

30:34.470 --> 30:35.250
and then apologize for
stealing something,

30:35.300 --> 30:36.730
then steal something else.

30:36.820 --> 30:38.580
I beg to differ.
Well, you beg all you want.

30:38.630 --> 30:39.750
It just isn't so.

30:45.490 --> 30:47.950
Uh, I'm going to have
to call you back, Dan.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.840
Pretty lame, huh?

30:52.950 --> 30:54.020
Where did you get that?

30:54.770 --> 30:56.440
I found it in one
of Marie's drawers.

30:56.470 --> 30:57.690
You push a button
on the back and...

30:57.720 --> 30:59.650
And it walks. I know.

31:03.580 --> 31:06.930
Aaaa

31:07.660 --> 31:08.860
Are you coming to bed?

31:10.240 --> 31:11.730
She's sorry, you know?

31:13.660 --> 31:16.120
For what it's worth, she was
going to give you this one, too.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.670
She was just waiting
for the right time.

31:18.450 --> 31:19.890
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

31:21.120 --> 31:23.080
I think we should take her
to a child psychologist.

31:23.930 --> 31:26.080
She's stolen twice in two days.

31:26.430 --> 31:27.890
Are we going to have
to buy this one, too?

31:28.440 --> 31:29.350
Already bought.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.550
The comic book guy was kind
enough to take my credit card

31:32.600 --> 31:33.610
over the phone this time.

31:34.230 --> 31:36.790
Do I even want to
know how much he was?

31:37.050 --> 31:39.700
Well, let's just say between
your pig and my toys,

31:39.770 --> 31:41.740
we spent over a thousand
bucks this week.

31:42.550 --> 31:43.520
Speaking of pigs...

31:43.990 --> 31:45.900
Now that we've adopted
the little fella,

31:46.070 --> 31:47.150
how does it work?

31:47.760 --> 31:50.420
Do they send us pictures of
him in fancy, new clothes?

31:50.490 --> 31:51.510
Does he write us letters?

31:51.640 --> 31:53.450
How do we know that the money
that we're sending him is

31:53.490 --> 31:56.160
actually being used to provide
a higher quality of slop?

31:56.240 --> 31:57.410
Okay, don't make fun.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.840
I already feel stupid enough.

31:59.870 --> 32:01.150
You know, I-I-I still have no idea

32:01.190 --> 32:03.690
why I was feeling what I
was feeling about him.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.470
Why I felt like I
needed to save him.

32:06.130 --> 32:09.960
But the good news is,
whatever it is seems to have passed.

32:10.250 --> 32:11.890
No more weird dreams about him.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.810
No more weird sounds
when I see meat.

32:15.160 --> 32:15.990
I mean...

32:16.140 --> 32:18.630
I even saw those lamb chops
in the freezer today.

32:18.710 --> 32:19.870
They didn't make a peep.

32:19.990 --> 32:21.160
Well, that's good.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.360
Glad to hear it.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.300
Well, how about we have
them tomorrow night?

32:24.460 --> 32:25.560
I want to make sure we eat them

32:25.580 --> 32:26.780
before they start talking again.

32:33.690 --> 32:34.820
Sorry about that.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.980
It's Melissa Treynet stuff.

32:38.050 --> 32:40.630
I got it from her desk at
the Animal Rights Coalition.

32:40.690 --> 32:41.810
Her boss let me have it.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.430
I was hoping maybe it
would spark something.

32:45.220 --> 32:45.920
And did it?

32:46.700 --> 32:48.870
Uh, no. Not really.

32:49.870 --> 32:51.130
I was so sure

32:51.180 --> 32:53.290
all of this had to do with
something she saw at the farm.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.320
Then today...

32:58.130 --> 32:59.800
Maybe I'm wrong about all of it.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.420
Maybe there was no DVD.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.780
Maybe there was no murder.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.550
Maybe she did run off with
her boyfriend to Mexico.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.810
You're right, honey.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.390
Maybe I should just go to bed.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.520
You said you wanted to talk?

33:42.760 --> 33:43.740
I just clocked out,

33:43.800 --> 33:46.160
so I need get back to the
locker room to change.

33:46.350 --> 33:48.720
If you don't turn in your
overalls after your shift,

33:48.770 --> 33:50.200
then the manager docks you.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.430
It's your last day on a job

33:53.470 --> 33:55.090
you never intended to keep,
Melissa.

33:55.580 --> 33:56.730
Do you really care if you get

33:56.760 --> 33:58.690
into a little bit of trouble
with your manager, huh?

34:01.030 --> 34:04.140
I'm assuming you're here to
talk about the DVD I sent you.

34:06.150 --> 34:08.219
You know, when you said

34:08.460 --> 34:10.380
you recorded something
that you wanted me to see,

34:10.440 --> 34:12.320
I assumed that it
was some atrocity

34:12.360 --> 34:14.449
that was being committed
right here on this farm.

34:15.139 --> 34:17.840
I never in a million years

34:17.929 --> 34:21.440
thought that the star of
your little film would be me.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.510
Okay, it's not me.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.560
It's my ledgers,
my bank statements.

34:28.469 --> 34:30.389
How can you be so smug?

34:31.130 --> 34:34.280
You're stealing money from your
own organization, Victoria.

34:34.330 --> 34:37.420
Money that people donated
because they trusted you.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.230
They believed in you.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.980
My God, you're young.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.730
Yes. After 23 years

34:47.840 --> 34:50.300
of selfless service,
I found it necessary

34:50.350 --> 34:52.590
to supplement my meager salary.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.150
You bought homes.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.280
You bought cars. You bought art...

34:56.320 --> 34:58.530
To entertain the
people whose generosity

34:58.570 --> 35:00.720
makes the coalition possible.

35:03.650 --> 35:07.890
You know, I admired you so much.

35:08.870 --> 35:10.910
And I, you.

35:11.870 --> 35:13.290
Which is why

35:13.790 --> 35:15.350
I want to make you a proposition.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.410
I am contemplating
retirement and...

35:21.050 --> 35:22.870
I was wondering if
you would consider

35:22.920 --> 35:24.210
following in my footsteps

35:24.240 --> 35:26.080
and taking over the
role as chairwoman.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.680
I'm sorry, Victoria.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.600
I made copies of the
DVD and mailed them

35:33.660 --> 35:35.810
to several people
with instructions

35:35.850 --> 35:37.200
to contact the media.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.800
I'm going to go change.

35:48.150 --> 35:49.960
This'll only hurt for a moment.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.350
I-I know you've been
in court all day.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.689
I don't mean to ambush you.

36:07.690 --> 36:08.630
Allison, I know what you want,

36:08.690 --> 36:10.170
but I don't have any
answers for you.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.400
How can you not have
any answers for me?

36:12.480 --> 36:13.430
Don't know what to tell you.

36:13.470 --> 36:14.750
After you called last night,

36:14.800 --> 36:16.370
I had a judge issue
a search warrant

36:16.400 --> 36:18.670
for Victoria Gossett's home,
car and office.

36:18.730 --> 36:21.390
Last I checked, we turned
up absolutely nothing.

36:22.050 --> 36:23.120
What about the ledgers?

36:23.160 --> 36:24.630
What about the bank statements?

36:24.680 --> 36:25.800
According to our
forensic accountant,

36:25.830 --> 36:27.870
if improprieties ever existed,

36:28.050 --> 36:29.550
they've been tended to.

36:29.870 --> 36:32.190
All of the coalition
books appear to be clean.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.370
I'm telling you, she's a thief.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.710
I'm telling you.
She is a murderer.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.729
I'm telling you, nothing
would give me more pleasure

36:38.730 --> 36:40.400
than to charge her
with those crimes.

36:40.401 --> 36:42.139
One, both-- I don't care.

36:42.140 --> 36:43.729
But if you're going to
file a charge of theft,

36:43.730 --> 36:45.470
something needs to
have been stolen.

36:45.550 --> 36:46.840
And if you're going to
file a murder charge,

36:46.860 --> 36:48.110
it's nice to have a dead body.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.920
Since we presently have neither...

36:56.290 --> 36:58.140
Okay, night, Bridge. Night, Daddy.

36:58.170 --> 36:59.720
What are you doing? Hmm?

37:00.160 --> 37:01.110
It's bedtime.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.710
Hasn't your mommy
already been in here

37:03.740 --> 37:04.980
to kiss you good night?

37:06.580 --> 37:09.260
I can't sleep,
not when you're mad at me.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.490
I'm not mad at you, sweetie.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.530
I'm confused.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.950
I know you know the difference
between right and wrong.

37:18.090 --> 37:19.630
And I know you know
that taking something

37:19.680 --> 37:21.720
that doesn't belong
to you isn't right.

37:22.590 --> 37:23.980
So why did you do it?

37:24.510 --> 37:26.000
Why did you do it twice?

37:26.580 --> 37:30.530
I thought it would be okay
since they were yours anyways.

37:31.020 --> 37:32.250
What are you talking about?

37:32.290 --> 37:34.430
It isn't mine.
It belongs to that man.

37:34.850 --> 37:36.280
It belongs at his store.

37:36.970 --> 37:38.550
But your name is in them.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.970
They told me Grandma did
it with red nail polish.

37:45.050 --> 37:45.950
Who told you?

37:46.900 --> 37:47.810
The toys?

37:52.850 --> 37:54.240
What are the odds?

37:54.400 --> 37:57.570
My mom must've gotten rid
of these 30 years ago.

37:58.230 --> 38:00.109
Given them to Goodwill or
sold them at a tag sale.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.730
I can't even think
of how many hands

38:01.780 --> 38:04.560
these must've passed through
before they got to that shop.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.700
You know, Axion and Sultar

38:06.750 --> 38:08.920
used to be my main
men for a while.

38:09.270 --> 38:11.350
I mean, we used to do
everything together.

38:11.450 --> 38:12.990
See, it turns out Marie gave you

38:13.030 --> 38:15.660
a pretty wonderful birthday
present after all. Yeah.

38:16.550 --> 38:18.410
I guess I should probably
cancel her appointment

38:18.460 --> 38:19.810
with the psychiatrist.

38:20.850 --> 38:23.120
And her reservation
at juvenile hall.

38:24.850 --> 38:25.870
What's the matter?

38:26.590 --> 38:28.850
Hmm? Whatever it is,
you want me to get

38:28.890 --> 38:30.380
my main men involved?

38:30.790 --> 38:34.390
Sultar is a robot designed
to solve cosmic mysteries.

38:34.610 --> 38:38.030
And Axion is a
mutant bounty hunter.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.170
So, whatever your problem is,

38:40.610 --> 38:41.850
between the two of them...

38:45.950 --> 38:46.950
Oh, thanks.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.410
I'm just frustrated.

38:49.550 --> 38:52.400
You know that old expression
"Getting away with murder"?

38:52.700 --> 38:55.740
I used to think it was just that-
an expression.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.930
Turns out there's a
lot of truth to it.

39:05.530 --> 39:09.030
Aaaa

39:26.770 --> 39:27.800
That's right.

39:28.630 --> 39:29.570
It's feeding time.

39:55.870 --> 39:57.110
I don't understand.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.950
How could I possibly
be under arrest

40:00.000 --> 40:01.990
for the murder of Melissa Treynet

40:02.220 --> 40:05.340
when no one is even certain
that she's actually dead?

40:05.420 --> 40:06.800
Actually, Ms. Gossett,

40:07.330 --> 40:09.760
things have changed in
that regard. Take a look.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.720
I'm sorry, but what am I
supposed to be seeing here?

40:16.840 --> 40:18.390
That's an X-ray of
Barney's stomach.

40:18.540 --> 40:19.800
Remember Barney, the little pig

40:19.830 --> 40:21.010
you helped me rescue? Yeah.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.990
That's an X-ray of
his lower intestine.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.700
You see this? Mm-hmm.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.360
The medical examiner tells us

40:26.400 --> 40:28.900
that's a metacarpal bone
from someone's finger.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.190
And she's pretty sure
that these are teeth.

40:33.010 --> 40:33.820
And apparently,

40:33.870 --> 40:35.050
the poor little guy's
been having a hard time

40:35.080 --> 40:36.030
passing these objects

40:36.070 --> 40:37.690
or they wouldn't still
be in his stomach.

40:38.740 --> 40:41.310
Are you suggesting that the
person who killed Melissa

40:41.400 --> 40:43.410
fed her to this pig?

40:43.480 --> 40:44.430
Not just Barney.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.500
Barney and some other
pigs at the farm.

40:48.850 --> 40:50.210
I don't even know what to say.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.480
And I certainly don't understand

40:53.510 --> 40:56.200
how you could suppose that I

40:56.210 --> 40:58.200
am involved in any of this.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.070
Ms. Gossett, are you
the registered owner

41:01.130 --> 41:03.490
of a snub-nosed.
38-caliber revolver?

41:03.680 --> 41:04.590
I am.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.820
I bought it a few years
ago for protection.

41:06.860 --> 41:09.540
There was a series of threats
against the coalition.

41:10.550 --> 41:11.660
Do you see this spot here?

41:13.090 --> 41:14.260
The medical examiner

41:14.310 --> 41:16.050
thinks that this is a bullet,

41:16.570 --> 41:18.700
which is odd, because as
far as anyone can tell,

41:18.730 --> 41:20.340
Barney has never been shot.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.600
I'd be willing to bet

41:21.660 --> 41:24.140
not only that that bullet is.
38 caliber,

41:24.260 --> 41:26.070
but that it could be
matched to your gun.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.900
And I'm sure you'd agree
with evidence like that,

41:28.950 --> 41:31.720
it would connect you
to Melissa's remains

41:32.150 --> 41:33.290
in a very significant way.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.010
The amazing thing is that

41:35.040 --> 41:37.720
all the other pigs who
were fed Melissa's remains

41:37.780 --> 41:39.310
were slaughtered a few days later.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.080
Any evidence that they might
have held for us is gone.

41:46.250 --> 41:49.070
If you hadn't helped
me rescue Barney,

41:49.120 --> 41:50.990
we really wouldn't have
much of a case right now.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.010
I dispatched a forensic team

41:53.060 --> 41:55.810
to the AgroUnited Farm to
investigate the possibility

41:55.870 --> 41:57.690
that you disposed of
Shane Carnahan's body

41:57.740 --> 41:58.830
in a similar fashion.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.000
In the meantime,
my office is speaking

42:01.040 --> 42:03.150
with a veterinary surgeon
who says that he's willing

42:03.200 --> 42:05.150
to remove the evidence
from the pig's stomach,

42:05.350 --> 42:06.920
so that you can be charged.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.830
My advice...

42:09.310 --> 42:11.180
Confess to both these
murders right now.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.480
Spare the city the
expense of a trial,

42:15.040 --> 42:18.560
and I won't pursue the death
penalty when I prosecute you.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.430
Otherwise, Barney is
going to have to go

42:21.470 --> 42:24.250
under the knife for a surgery
he doesn't even need.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.410
Come on, Ms. Gossett.

42:27.990 --> 42:30.570
You're still against
animal cruelty, aren't you?
