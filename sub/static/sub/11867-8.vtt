00:30.030 --> 00:32.191
I got it covered,
but thanks.

00:38.121 --> 00:41.249
Actually, you could help me
find the back door.

00:43.293 --> 00:47.536
Well, it's by used games,
but you're really not supposed
to go out that way.

I won't tell anyone
if you won't.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.735
Yeah, it's me.
Mmm-hmm.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.487
I think I got
a live one.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.090
Probably not the best idea.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.429
That comes out
on the pistol range.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.766
Please, tell me
you're my lawyer.

No, but I think
I can keep you
out ofjail.

What did you
have in mind?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.563
CARTER: You want
to hire this guy?

01:55.616 --> 01:56.947
He's the best
in his field.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.278
Oh, yeah,
if screwing up
is a field.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.989
Well, we need
a particle physicist,
Carter,

02:01.079 --> 02:02.819
and he's the most
promising one
out there.

02:02.914 --> 02:07.374
Whoa, he was accepted
to MIT at the age
of 13. Expelled.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.874
Accepted at Yale.
Expelled. Cornell. Oh,
guess what? Expelled.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.582
Not before winning
the Spadaro Foundation Award
for Superstring Theory.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.216
The guy set the bar
so high,

02:16.303 --> 02:18.009
they haven't even bothered
to give it out since.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.302
Here's a resume highlight.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.259
Just stole $3.1 million

02:21.308 --> 02:24.050
from the U.S.
Border Patrol account
for drug interdiction.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.805
Allegedly.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.640
And can't we just agree
that the war on drugs

02:27.731 --> 02:30.939
is really a moralistic
assault on individual
liberty, hmm?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.019
Or not.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.977
Hello, Zane.
Welcome to Eureka.
Good to see you, Sam.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.315
Right back
at you, Doc.

02:36.365 --> 02:40.074
So we got one brainiac
at the standard
recruitment rate, 25,000.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.197
Whoa.
25,000 for this guy?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.994
For 30, I'll throw in
dinner and a movie,

02:45.082 --> 02:46.538
but I won't go
past second base.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.115
I'm not
that kind of boy.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.624
I'll give you a check
this afternoon.

And throw in some singles.

after that is not my domain.

Don't want him.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.811
Well, you got him.
Allison, just...

03:13.860 --> 03:16.852
Technically, he's still
a prisoner, Carter.
He's your responsibility.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.027
Until when?

03:18.073 --> 03:20.689
Until you think
he can be trusted.

Jo! Don't shoot
the prisoner.
Don't. Just...

04:22.095 --> 04:23.084
How about
| just wing him?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.005
No, down.
Allison wants him
at G.D. alive.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.469
Better use these, then.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.144
Huh. Bracelets.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.692
They're geodetic
coordinate transceivers.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.237
They'll show
his location
within one meter,

04:42.282 --> 04:45.149
and if he tries
to run, it's also
got a restraint field.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.781
An emerging graviton
field generator?
Very cool.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.739
If he tries to escape,
hit the button.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.319

was on the origins
of the universe, right?

You would.
I have something
to show you.

05:33.959 --> 05:37.247
ZANE: Holy crap.
You actually built it?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.168
What exactly
did we build?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.330
A chaotic
inflation device.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.174
It will recreate
the origin singularity

05:45.262 --> 05:47.344
in this observable
containment field.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.590
The Big Bang.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.970
Supercritical ignition
will take place 24 hours
after we start the device.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.303
And if it works,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.093
it will show us
the first moments
of the universe.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.806
And potentially rewrite
every cosmological theory
we know.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.145
I don't mean to be
a wet blanket,

06:01.194 --> 06:02.695
but won't that
blow up the planet?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.610
Wow, we didn't think
of that. Good thing
you're here, Carter.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.156
But seriously,
this thing's gonna pump out
a ton of Hawking radiation,

06:08.201 --> 06:09.941
and then it's gonna
go supernova.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.617
So please tell me
you have a plan.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.241
You can just
shut it off, right?

06:13.331 --> 06:15.413
Well, actually, no.
Once induction is started,

06:15.500 --> 06:17.957
it's essentially
a runaway cyclotron bomb.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.420
That's a bad plan.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.587
Relax. We have
four generators creating
a layered particle field

06:22.674 --> 06:23.709
that will contain
the explosion.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.882
And one of us...
Heads.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.254
...me, will be
in the lab continuously
to adjust the field.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.966
And as long as
the current density
doesn't go below 200,

06:34.060 --> 06:36.346
the field Will hold.

what's for lunch?

the field needs to be
at full strength.

the containment
protocols again.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.548
Morning. You want
some breakfast?

12:40.593 --> 12:41.582
How...

12:41.678 --> 12:44.761
This panini press makes
rocking quesadillas.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.297
Who...
Magic of the Internet.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.383
This works like
a wireless keyboard.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.687
The IR signal talks
to the receiver
on your computer.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.353
It took some curve-balling
getting the number pad
to navigate the web,

12:54.440 --> 12:56.601
but I've had delivery guys
flying in and out of here
all morning.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.809
Give me that.
Give it to me.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.318
You're sending
all this stuff back.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.022
The restocking fee
is gonna be killer.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.950
Who paid for all this?

13:07.996 --> 13:09.452
Yeah, about that.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.362
You really shouldn't
leave credit card info
on your hard drive.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.493
That's just
poor security.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.539
Oh, my God.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.621
Watch him.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.674
On the upside,
I got them to raise
your credit limit.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.546
Yeah, you're welcome!

13:25.680 --> 13:29.264
Oh, don't even try it,
okay? You may get to him,
but you won't get to me.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.517
Jo Lupo?
Yeah?

13:32.603 --> 13:36.437
I got 19 boxes
from Liza's Lingerie.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.770
And can I just say,
God bless.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.525
I had to guess
the size.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.864
You should really
try everything on.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.654
I'll make popcorn.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.660
Hey, Henry.
HENRY: Hey!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.171
You don't really
need him, do you?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.464
I don't know.

14:03.885 --> 14:04.920
Who?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.296
Zane Donovan.

14:06.346 --> 14:10.089
You can find some other
particle physicist, right?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.798
Maybe somebody
without a felony record?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.261
I suppose so.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.436
You've got to go tell Allison
so that I can take him
back to the Feds

14:16.522 --> 14:18.604
and start rebuilding
my credit score.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.352
Okay.
Great.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.901
What you doing?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.364
(LAUGHING)

14:27.075 --> 14:28.485
Watching.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.746
That looks bad.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.542
Shouldn't you
be watching this
instead of that?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.544
Ah! This is funnier.

14:44.217 --> 14:48.756
Didn't you say that
if we were below 200,
we were in trouble?

14:48.846 --> 14:51.132
Yeah.
Okay.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.885
Hey! I was watching that!

14:52.934 --> 14:54.640
Am I wrong?
Shouldn't we make
these numbers go up?

14:54.727 --> 14:55.716
(SIGHS)

14:56.521 --> 14:57.556
(MACHINE BEEPS)

14:57.605 --> 14:59.641
Maybe that'll help.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.972
Maybe?

15:11.452 --> 15:12.908
HENRY: See ya.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.824
He wasn't acting like Henry.
He couldn't even remember
what he told me yesterday.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.124
And where the hell
is Stark?

15:20.211 --> 15:21.621
I don't know.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.794
Well, you were all
saying how dangerous
this experiment is.

15:23.881 --> 15:28.591
What happens if
Henry's asleep at the switch
when the Big Bang goes boom?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.001
Huh?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.427
It's bad,
isn't it?

15:31.514 --> 15:32.594
Yeah.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.382
Do my shoes
match my dress?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.096
What?

15:38.146 --> 15:40.262
Just look at me
for a second.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.393
(LAUGHING) Wait,
wait. No, I'm sorry.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.933
No, it's...

15:45.027 --> 15:46.016
(LAUGHING)

15:46.696 --> 15:48.106
How do you feel?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.904
Um... Hungry.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.440
(MUTTERING)

15:52.535 --> 15:55.277
Do you feel like
you're thinking clearly?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.030
What was the question?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.114
Oh.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.169
You've got
to be kidding me.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.807
You've got to focus
for me, okay? You gotta
get on your phone,

16:18.853 --> 16:20.844
and you're gonna have
to call a meeting of experts.

16:20.938 --> 16:24.430
Good, good. Oh, wait.
A meeting with who?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.351
Anyone who is involved
in that experiment
that's gonna explode

16:27.445 --> 16:28.605
if you don't
keep an eye on it.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.905
Yeah.
Right.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.607
Oh, wait! Oh, wait,
wait, wait. Do I need
to push nine first?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.401
Carter, I'm kind of busy.
I can't come running up
here every time you call.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.656
Oh, thank God,
you're normal.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.821
I was starting to think
I was the smartest one
in the building.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.410
We got a major problem.

16:41.501 --> 16:45.460
People are regressing.
They're starting
to act dumb.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.920
Dumb?
Yeah.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.749
So what's protocol?
What do we do?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.834
Only one thing
we can do.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.882
Pull my finger.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.008
Oh.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.130
(LAUGHING)

17:02.772 --> 17:05.013
Okay, what do you
mean they're stupid?

17:05.107 --> 17:09.146
I mean stupid.
Like...
Stupid. Stupid.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.857
Carter, you can't
catch stupid.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.522
This may be my
favorite conversation
of all time.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.863
Look, something happened
to Allison and Henry and
Stark and who knows else.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.369
It happened right
in the middle of that
chaotic inflation thing.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.868
VVaH,youleﬁ
that thing running
without anyone watching it?

17:22.959 --> 17:25.541
We got it covered.
Sort of.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.999
Sort of? You've got
to clear out that building
before that thing blows.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.208
It could take out
the whole facility.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.715
Look, don't worry about it,
all right? We'll fix it.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.050
What?
We always fix it.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.718
We don't always fix it.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.014
Henry does it
sometimes, or Stark,
or Allison.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.643
I'm just saying we usually
have smart people to lean on.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.220
Hey, I'm smart.
I'm plenty smart!

17:46.315 --> 17:48.977
I mean science smart.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.729
Don't get snappy.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.902
Okay, you're
coming to G.D.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.312
No, I'm not touching
that experiment.

17:54.407 --> 17:59.026
lfl start pushing buttons,
I could accelerate
the decay of that field.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.534
Then we need the guys
who designed the machine.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.286
Okay, you said
they're all dumb.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.362
Then we need
to figure out why.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.123
Let's start with a list
of all the people
who have been affected.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.746
How are you feeling?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.497
You feel dumb?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.578
No. You?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.379
How could you tell?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.665
(EXCLAIMS)

18:13.759 --> 18:15.750
It might be just
affecting the people
at G.D.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.427
I'll head up there. You
pull the evacuation plans.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.087
You should help.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.425
How are you holding up?
Well, people keep calling,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.432
and I'm making a list
of scientists for you.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.389
Okay, here it is.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.778
Everybody on this list
works for a different
department at G.D.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.947
What do they
have in common?

18:39.785 --> 18:40.820
Well, they all work here.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.197
Thank you.
Yes. Very helpful.

18:43.289 --> 18:47.828
Have you shut down
all the dangerous projects?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.375
No, but that's
a good idea.
I'll write that down.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.624
No! No! No! I'll do it.
I'm the head of Global.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.296
Okay, I know.
I know.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.960
Just listen. I...
Look, I pulled all
the manuals from

18:58.054 --> 19:01.296
(STAMMERING)
the chaotic thingy,
and...

19:02.516 --> 19:04.973
VVeH,|dont
understand any of it.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.307
We're gonna figure
this out. I promise.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.479
I'm scared.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.644
I feel like I'm
losing myself, and...

19:12.735 --> 19:16.944
Why don't you stay here?
Just sit down,
and you stay at work.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.402
And, I'll go
find a doctor.
A normal doctor.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.030
Okay? We're gonna
sort this out.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.443
lhope.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.546
(WHISTLES)

19:39.637 --> 19:43.095
Excuse me?
Are you dumb?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.388
Huh?
Sorry.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.057
What's the square root
of 3,006?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.932
Don't know.
Apologies.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.854
You know, I was
never any good at
combinatoric math,

19:52.942 --> 19:57.481
but if you threw me
a couple of Chomsky nominal
form equations, I'm your gal.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.067
Great! There's a dumb
virus going around,

20:00.157 --> 20:01.693
and you're gonna
help me figure out
what's causing it.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.198
A dumb virus?

20:03.244 --> 20:05.360
(CHATTERING)

20:05.538 --> 20:07.779
Oh! Yeah.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.285
Wish I could, but,
see, I'm a vet, and

20:10.376 --> 20:14.210
if you brought me a marmoset
with cognitive decline, I'd
be happy to help, but...

20:14.255 --> 20:18.214
(STAMMERING)
No, I don't work
on people.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.260
Today you do.
No.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.130
Oh, you don't
want me to.
It's not good.

20:29.145 --> 20:33.013
You're wearing one of
my presents under there,
aren't you?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.226
Come on,
you can tell me.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.352
(ZANE EXCLAIMS)

20:39.196 --> 20:41.733
Okay, I deserved that.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.781
This is nice work.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.906
How did you get enough
phase power for the field
in the biometric lock?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.161
Redox battery?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.955
No, it's
a nano-titanite cell.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.578
Sweet.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.250
How do you keep
the amp load
from shorting out?

20:58.299 --> 21:00.290
It's a dielectric
waveguide.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.464
Nice.

21:02.887 --> 21:06.846
Hey, do you have
the specs on that
chaotic inflation test?

21:06.932 --> 21:07.921
VVhy?

21:08.017 --> 21:11.805
Why don't you let me
take a look at the
containment structure for you?

21:12.563 --> 21:14.895
And if I'm helping you,
maybe you can help me.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.680
And here it comes.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.768
There's only one thing
I want from you, Jojo.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.820
A sandwich.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.775
Yeah, the Geneva Conventions
state that I get
a sandwich for lunch.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.655
And you'll read this.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.575
And help.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.158
Yeah.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.174

Marco!

21:41.634 --> 21:43.124

Marco!

21:43.844 --> 21:45.345
Marco!
Marco!

21:45.638 --> 21:47.128
Marco!
Marco!

21:47.890 --> 21:49.300
Marco!
Marco!

21:49.391 --> 21:52.758
Polo. One of you
says Polo. The game
is Marco Polo.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.886
Come on.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.979
Polo!
Polo!

21:57.066 --> 21:58.476
Polo!
Polo!

21:58.984 --> 22:00.485
Tell me you found
something.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.816
Well, I'm not sure
because this really
isn't my field.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.775
However,
everybody I've tested

22:05.825 --> 22:08.908
seems to have
a critically low level
of GABA.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.245
I didn't know
I had any GABA.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.287
Gamma-aminobutyric acid.
It's a neurotransmitter.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.325
Okay, and if you
don't have enough,
it lowers intelligence?

22:17.378 --> 22:18.367
It could. Yeah.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.454
Critically reduced levels
cause Alzheimer's
disease in monkeys.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.589
Okay, so where's
it coming from?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.507
Air conditioning,
water coolers?

22:25.594 --> 22:28.176
l have no idea,
and our neuropharmacologist

22:28.264 --> 22:30.801
is currently playing
Candy Land.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.260
Okay.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.808
Gather everyone
you can who's still
thinking straight.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.640
Meet me in the
conference room, fast.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.719
Conference room.

22:40.025 --> 22:44.519
All right, we got a botanist,
a math theorist, a chemist,
a nutritionist

22:44.613 --> 22:47.104
and a lepipotamus.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.030
Lepidopterist.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.449
Butterflies.

22:50.536 --> 22:51.867
Fantastic.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.827
All right, everyone.
If you want
to gather around.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.864
I trust you've
been briefed.

22:55.916 --> 23:00.000
Now, you all know
that the Big Bang device is
in danger of melting down

23:00.045 --> 23:02.206
and the people who built it
are incapacitated.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.544
So, who do we have
who can help
with this experiment?

23:08.220 --> 23:09.801
Yeah, you know,
it's not their field.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.006
We need a physicist
or maybe a molecular
theorist.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.514
Right. We've got
a room full of geniuses,

23:14.560 --> 23:17.848
and all we can do
is eradicate plant rot
and do triage on a butterfly.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.762
Let's switch gears.

23:19.857 --> 23:23.395
All right. What we have
to do is cure someone
who can help us.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.066
If we can find out
what's knocking down
the GABA,

23:25.154 --> 23:27.566
then maybe we can
reverse the mental decline.

23:27.656 --> 23:31.365
Right? So, who can help
with that? Anyone?

23:31.410 --> 23:34.026
The GABA knockdown.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.535
You.
What do you do?

23:35.581 --> 23:36.991
Epigeneticist.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.290
The butyric acid cycle
could be affected by
any number of factors.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.414
Enzyme overgrowth,
radiation exposure,
a virus.

23:43.464 --> 23:46.046
Whoa, radiation
can cause this?

23:46.091 --> 23:49.424
If it disrupts
the tRNA synthetase.

23:49.470 --> 23:53.884
Okay, well, the chaotic
thing was pumping out
a lot of radiation.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.343
No, no,
I don't think so.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.301
I've done studies
with radiation
on animals before,

23:58.395 --> 24:01.728
and that device would
have to be tuned
to a precise wavelength

24:01.774 --> 24:03.981
in order
to cause this effect.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.436
What if somebody
was tuning it
on purpose?

24:08.530 --> 24:10.361
Well, it's possible.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.940
They'd have to know
Big Bang nucleo-synthesis
and string theory.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.445
(LAUGHING)
Yeah.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.986
Well, I have a guy
in myjail cell who might
know all of those things,

24:17.081 --> 24:20.949
and he'd think it was pretty
hilarious to turn everyone
at G.D. into a moron.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.284
All right, you just work
on curing Allison and
all of the others.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.703
Any of you
with a medical background,
you go with Dr. Glenn.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.460
The rest of you,

24:28.550 --> 24:30.677
start learning physics.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.921
JO OVER PHONE: Carter,
we 've got a problem.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.806
CARTER:
Tell me about it.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.978
No, it's about Zane.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.430
Are you sure
you locked the cell?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.474
Of course
I locked the cell.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.142
Well, we got
to find him.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.478
Well, we could
track him with these.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.696
Or even better.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.489
He got out of
the bracelet.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.704
How?

25:00.791 --> 25:04.579
By mistake, I may
have told him how
to hack the lock.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.668
All right,
thanks, Sergeant.

25:13.762 --> 25:18.301
The state police are
on every road out of town.
They'll find him.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.012
No, they won't. He's good.
He knows how to hide.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.934
Yeah, well, we've got
the G.D. computer.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.183
It's running
probabilities
for any escape route.

25:25.274 --> 25:28.357
Every phone call he's
ever made, every map
he's downloaded.

25:28.444 --> 25:31.402
No one in this world
knows Zane better
than this computer.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.771
Someone might.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.651
(LAUGHING)

25:38.704 --> 25:40.035
That's awesome.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.202
I know.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.247
Hey, where is everybody?

25:43.333 --> 25:48.168
Oh, Carter had me send
them home. Something about
a, um, chaotic...

25:49.214 --> 25:51.170
Oh, something or other.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.166
(SIGHS)

25:53.218 --> 25:55.550
Is it that thing
I helped build?

25:55.596 --> 25:59.009
Yeah. I remember
something like that.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.426
You okay?
Not even.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.597
Can't keep
a thought in my head
for, like, 10 seconds.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.433
My car's busted.
Nothing to do.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.935
It's bunk.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.867
Still the smartest
guy I know.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.531
Not saying much.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.453
What if this
doesn't get better?

26:31.090 --> 26:33.581
I guess we'll just
be dumb together.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.411
Now breaking and entering
is just a bad idea.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.667
Well, I must say,
I'm impressed.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.962
What did you do?
Refocus some of your
satellites to pick me up?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.384
Figured 50 miles
from Eureka
was far enough.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.800
No. You vacationed here
when you were 10.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.502
I figure it's off
the main roads.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.009
Place to hide out
for a couple of days first.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.967
Well, I guess my FBI
file is more detailed
than I thought.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.677
It's not in your file.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.855
Well, then that computer
of yours must have an
amazing predictive algorithm.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.728
Didn't use the computer.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.189
I called your mother.

27:36.822 --> 27:37.811
(CHUCKLING)

27:39.575 --> 27:41.236
You called my mother?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.280
I need to know
what you did.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.492
Okay. You were right.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.414
That cell has
a damn good lock.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.292
I had to order
a new master key off
of the Ithaca Lock website.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.626
They run
a pretty tight ship.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.587
I had to give them
your social security
number and everything.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.667
That's not
what I'm talking about.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.593
What did you do
to the Big Bang
experiment?

28:02.681 --> 28:03.670
What are you talking...

28:03.765 --> 28:05.266
What did you do
to make everyone stupid?

28:05.350 --> 28:06.681
Whoa! Whoa!
That's crazy.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.349
All right,
look. This isn't
a joke anymore.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.011
Okay? This is serious.
I need those people
back on their game.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.225
(LAUGHING) You think
I would intentionally
mess up that experiment?

28:13.317 --> 28:14.807
Yeah, and I'm running
out of options.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.148
Well, I wouldn't.
Because it's beautiful.

28:18.197 --> 28:22.440
Ifthat thing up there
works, it could change
the laws of physics.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.195
Then why are you
running from it?

28:26.705 --> 28:27.990
As I see it,
there are
two sides to this.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.907
Either you're with me,
or you're against me.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.452
It's your problem.
Why should I help?

28:34.630 --> 28:37.542
Because if you'd stop
being a selfish jackass
for more than five seconds,

28:37.633 --> 28:40.591
you might discover
that you could be
a part of something.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.093
A community.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.422
What makes you think
I give a crap about
finding a community?

28:46.516 --> 28:50.008
Because we all do,
and you're smart enough
to know that.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.982
(SIGHS)
He's just standing there.
He's thinking.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.355
Well, he doesn't look
like he's thinking.
He looks sick.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.895
That's because
containment's down
to 14 percent.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.486
When that
chaotic device blows,
that field's gonna fail.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.862
Well, you've got
43 minutes to figure out
a way to make it stronger.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.573
Yeah,
so figure it out.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.784
ALLISON:
And the answer is?

29:10.874 --> 29:13.331
Clear the building.
Anyone who's still here,
get them out.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.579
CARTER: Zane, nonessential
personnel are gone.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.754
Focus, all right?
You're one of
the top guys here.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.585
You not only won the
Spadaro Foundation Award,

29:20.634 --> 29:22.420
but they don't even bother
to give it out anymore.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.677
Yeah, they stopped giving
it out because someone stole
all of Mrs. Spadaro's money.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.345
They hacked
her system.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.218
Even I couldn't find how.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.509
If I couldn't help her,
I can't help you.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.844
It would take me 18 hours
to rebuild that thing.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.645
And if it blows
without containment,

29:40.445 --> 29:42.151
Well, you're
all we've got.

29:42.739 --> 29:46.277
So could you bring
in more shielding?

29:46.368 --> 29:47.824
Oh! Oh!
That's good!

29:47.911 --> 29:51.119
It would take
at least 100 tons of
metallic hydrogen sheets.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.540
That's not good.
Well, how about

29:52.624 --> 29:55.286
another field around the
field, or double it, or
reinforce it with something?

29:55.335 --> 29:56.450
Oh! Duct tape.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.289
Yeah,
like duct tape.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.839
It's a layered
particle field.

29:59.923 --> 30:03.507
The only way to reinforce
it is with another layered
particle field.

30:03.593 --> 30:04.582
Keep going.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.501
Like an emergent
graviton field.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.302
The bracelets.
They're in the car.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.839
Go! I'll crack
the control circuits.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.721
Well, so does that
mean we're good?

30:19.151 --> 30:22.518
ZANE: All right, we're gonna
build a second force field
to contain this one.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.069
Now, I need binned
gradients and a way
into the aiming circuit.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.113
FEMALE VOICE: Danger.
Containment levels critical.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.945

30:40.464 --> 30:42.500
NATHAN: Found it!
Awesome.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.005
NATHAN: Yeah!
ZANE: We're in business.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.587
Touchdown!
Got 'em.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.133
Oh, how much time
do we have?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.794
Not much.
Not helping!

30:48.847 --> 30:50.462
Well, what else
do we have to do?

30:50.515 --> 30:52.506
The bracelets
generate a bubble
of charged gravitons.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.887
Ifl can jack into
the aiming circuit
and get the timing right,

30:54.978 --> 30:57.720
I might reinforce
the field long enough
to contain the explosion.

30:57.814 --> 31:01.056
(LAUGHING) l have not
a clue about anything
you just said.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.857
He's gonna
contain it.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.569
What?
I'm sorry, Jack.

31:06.656 --> 31:10.148
I just realized
this is how you must
feel all the time.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.826
Thank you, Henry.
Very kind.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.202
(RUMBLING)

31:14.247 --> 31:16.659
CARTER: Zane, you want
to turn on that extra shield?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.164
ZANE: No, I've got
to time it right.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.041
l over-cranked
the snot out
of this thing.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.540
The field will only last
three seconds.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.046
Not yet. Not yet!

31:35.185 --> 31:37.642
Don't let me die
in this crap town.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.644
Now!

32:05.382 --> 32:07.213
So that's what all
the fuss was about?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.250
Are you kidding?
It's the Big Bang.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.050
The beginning
of the beginning.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.088
This data's gonna
keep physicists busy
for 50 years.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.598
It kind of looks like
a scoop of rainbow sherbet.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.679
(BOTH LAUGH)

32:18.770 --> 32:20.510
I think it's pretty.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.596
Mmm.
Not as pretty as you.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.266
Oh, that's so sweet.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.274
(CHUCKLING)

32:28.321 --> 32:30.107
How are you feeling?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.235
Kind of hungry.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.280
The machine's off,
so why's everybody still
acting like a moron?

32:40.375 --> 32:43.082
Because the experiment
wasn't the cause.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.706
Are you sure?

32:45.839 --> 32:47.750
The experiment produced
Hawking radiation.

32:47.799 --> 32:52.293
All of these tests
prove that doesn't
affect brain tissue.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.421
So what's causing this?

32:55.474 --> 32:56.509
I don't know.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.433
And I don't know
how to reverse it.
So what do we do now?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.719
We don't give up.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.642
Okay.

33:06.485 --> 33:07.600
Okay.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.317
Hey, Henry.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.697
Yeah. Hey.

33:14.784 --> 33:17.776
I called the CDC
and the NIH. They're
on their way.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.660
Good!
What are those?

33:20.832 --> 33:24.700
The CDC is the Center
for Disease Control.

33:24.878 --> 33:29.542
And the NIH is the
National something
of Health and...

33:30.383 --> 33:31.418
NO.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.217
Anyway, Dr. Glenn
is going to be taking all

33:34.304 --> 33:37.922
the affected people
to G.D. for some tests.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.053
You're a real
good friend, Jack.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.263
ljust...

33:44.564 --> 33:47.055
ljust feel bad
'cause I keep things
from you.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.526
Oh, what are you
talking about?

33:48.568 --> 33:50.809
The Beverly stuff.
You know...

33:52.447 --> 33:54.233
What she did to Kim.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.405
Henry, what did
Beverly do to Kim?

34:03.083 --> 34:04.118
Maybe you could find out.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.995
I mean, you're really good
at that stuff.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.578
Yeah. Yeah,
sure. Sure, sure.

34:09.673 --> 34:12.585
Wow, that's cool.
Can I try?

34:12.676 --> 34:14.257
Oh, yeah.
Here.

34:14.678 --> 34:15.713
Wow.
Stay with me.

34:15.762 --> 34:16.877
We're talking
about Kim?

34:16.972 --> 34:20.339
(STAMMERING)
You can have a turn
right after me.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.472

34:21.560 --> 34:23.175
Sheriff, Sheriff.
Come here, come here.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.891
Yeah. Hey, oh, Sam.
Good, we could use
a boost of brain power.

Slap her to a telescope,
you'll be talking
to aliens by Kwanza.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.413
What's the
difference?

34:43.123 --> 34:46.035
Oh, crap. Well,
you can get in line
for the yo-yo.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.245
Oh.

34:49.671 --> 34:52.413
Well, Sam's got it,
and he didn't go anywhere
near that experiment.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.716
Right.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.919
Hey, Vincent,
can I get another
chicken san?

34:56.011 --> 34:57.217
That was delish.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.594
Oh, sorry.
We're fresh out.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.675
Vince, you can
order some more.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.473
Really?
From where?

35:05.103 --> 35:06.764
From right there.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.981
Oh, hey.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.100
You are smart.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.269
Yeah.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.397
And you're not.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.611
And he's not.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.991
Man, let me yo.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.113
I want to.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.619
No, no, I'm gonna yo.
Okay, okay.
Wait, wait.

35:24.706 --> 35:28.790
Henry, did you have some
tasty chicken yesterday?

35:28.835 --> 35:30.791
Sure, we all did.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.169
Right. I didn't.
Neither did Zane.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.871
I'm a vegetarian.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.135
WOMAN: Oh, please.
Sheriff, that sounds
kind of nutty.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.808
CARTER: Maybe, but
everybody who was affected
had your chicken.

35:47.896 --> 35:51.889
Do you use
growth hormones,
tetracycline, nafcillin?

35:51.983 --> 35:54.850
My chicken is
completely organic.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.311
Right. Okay.
Maybe something's
getting into their feed.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.238
Where's the rest
of them?
He's the only one.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.415
Took me seven years
of somatic cell-transfer

36:10.502 --> 36:12.367
and DNA stripping
to make Chester.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.248
He's a clone?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.330
He has ears,
you know.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.546
Little Rhode Island Red,
mix in some Golden Montazah,

36:19.636 --> 36:23.424
a dash of Leghorn,
and he's the perfect bird.

36:24.557 --> 36:28.015
Aren't you, Chester?
Yes, you are.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.433

(CROWING)

36:33.858 --> 36:35.519
(IMITATING CLUCKING)

36:35.568 --> 36:39.902
If you only have one
chicken, then where does
the meat come from?

36:53.712 --> 36:56.078
Oh, this may be
the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.005
Where do you think
chicken comes from,
Shenﬁ?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.211
From chickens.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.294
Chickens that have
been murdered,
but not anymore.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.880
The avian holocaust
is over, my friend.

37:06.933 --> 37:10.016
So you're growing
independent parts
from stem cells?

37:10.061 --> 37:13.724
It's a breakthrough.
I used to clone
the whole chicken.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.185
Now I just
grow the parts
people want to eat,

37:16.234 --> 37:18.020
so I don't have
to kill anything.

37:18.069 --> 37:22.654
Well, if you're growing
meat with no brain

37:22.741 --> 37:25.357
then is it safe?

37:25.410 --> 37:27.241
It's perfectly safe.
It's organic.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.324
And with my new grow lights,
five times as productive.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.201
I just installed them.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.584
Maybe your grow lights
are making the meat
five times as stupid.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.621
So, disconnected
from the neural net,

37:40.592 --> 37:44.335
the only way you can make
these pieces of meat grow

37:44.429 --> 37:46.420
is if you flood it
with bicuculline.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.259
Yes, but that's organic.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.841
It's a plant extract.
The grow lights
enhance the process.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.348
But it's also
a GABA blocker.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.599
GABA? Hey!
Yes.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.604
It's depressing
the GABA production,

37:57.650 --> 38:00.483
and it's causing
the cognitive decline.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.440
Oh, my God.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.067
I had no idea.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.235
Do we have
to tell Chester?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.700
He'll be
so ashamed.

38:14.751 --> 38:15.786
That'll do it?

38:15.877 --> 38:18.118
The sulfonate
should flush out
the bicuculline

38:18.213 --> 38:21.546
and bring the GABA back
into balance. Maybe.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.419
(STAMMERING)
What? Well,
why wouldn't it work?

38:23.468 --> 38:25.459
Because I'm
winging it here.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.086
Maybe is the best
you're going to get.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.341
I'm gonna

about it.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.481
She's very smart.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.903
It'll work.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.821
Okay, this might hurt
just a little bit.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.904
I'm actually not very good
with people. I'm used
to giving shots to mangabeys.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.656
What's a mangabey?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.496
(EXCLAIMS)
No idea.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.619
Hold on.
There, good.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.507
You know,
as scary as it was
being dumb,

39:06.553 --> 39:08.339
it was also
kind of liberating.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.635
Speak for yourself.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.343
What? You found
nothing positive
in the experience?

39:13.393 --> 39:15.099

will excuse me, I have a

that you're ready
to be on your own.

when that might be?

Turns out she's
giving her award
again this year

40:22.712 --> 40:25.875
because someone made
an anonymous gift
to her foundation

40:25.924 --> 40:28.085

40:29.928 --> 40:31.714
You gonna turn me in?

40:33.431 --> 40:37.845

protecting the anonymity
of charitable donations, so...

money is safe.
