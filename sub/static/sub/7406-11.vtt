THE ONE HURTING THEM.

15:54.822 --> 15:56.588
YOU ARE.

15:56.590 --> 15:58.690
YOU KNOW WHAT MUST BE DONE.

15:58.692 --> 16:02.193

YOUR LAST DAY ON EARTH FIGHTING?

16:38.191 --> 16:42.091
- [GRUNTING]
THIS IS NOT MY LAST DAY!

16:42.660 --> 16:44.393
- STOP!

16:47.798 --> 16:49.963
- RAVEN?

16:52.467 --> 16:54.266
I WILL GO WITH YOU.

16:54.268 --> 16:56.368

16:56.370 --> 17:00.004
- YOU NEED TO GET BACK
IN THE SAFETY ROOM! PLEASE!

17:00.006 --> 17:03.373
- I CAN'T HIDE FROM

PREPARED FOR YOU.

17:38.939 --> 17:41.706
EVERYTHING IS READY
FOR TRIGON'S ASCENT.

17:41.708 --> 17:45.676
- YOU'RE A FOOL.
WHATEVER HE PROMISED,
HE WON'T DELIVER.

17:45.678 --> 17:49.312
- DEAR CHILD, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:49.314 --> 17:51.881
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN FATHER?

17:51.883 --> 17:53.782
- YOU ARE MERELY THE PORTAL,

17:53.784 --> 17:56.918
AN INSIGNIFICANT PAWN
IN TRIGON'S GAME.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.320
- THEN I GUESS
WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON,

17:59.322 --> 18:03.390
AND ONCE HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS,
YOU'LL BE INSIGNIFICANT, TOO.

18:03.392 --> 18:05.125
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

[GRUNTING]

18:10.731 --> 18:14.365
- COME TO THINK OF IT, SLADE,
YOU'RE ALREADY INSIGNIFICANT.

18:14.367 --> 18:17.301
EVEN YOUR OWN ARMY
WON'T LISTEN TO YOU.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.736

18:19.738 --> 18:21.471

- DUDE, WE WERE ONLY
TRYING TO HELP HER.

18:38.154 --> 18:41.054
- I FEAR IT IS TOO LATE
TO ASSIST HER.

18:41.056 --> 18:42.722
- IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

18:42.724 --> 18:45.825

19:00.372 --> 19:03.139
THE GEM RETURNS
OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

19:03.141 --> 19:06.175
YOU DID NOT DELIVER HER.
I DID.

19:06.177 --> 19:08.477
- WE HAD A DEAL.

19:08.479 --> 19:10.946
I HELD UP MY PART
OF THE BARGAIN.

- [LAUGHING EVILLY]

19:16.051 --> 19:17.784

19:51.947 --> 19:54.080
- RAVEN!

19:57.818 --> 19:59.450

19:59.452 --> 20:02.252
AND THERE IS NO STOPPING
WHAT IS MEANT TO BE.

20:02.254 --> 20:03.753
- YOU'RE WILLING
TO GIVE UP ON EVERYTHING,

20:03.755 --> 20:06.288
ALL BECAUSE OF SOME PROPHECY
YOU HEARD AS A CHILD?

20:06.290 --> 20:08.089
WHAT IF IT'S WRONG?

20:08.091 --> 20:10.424
- ROBIN, I KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.259
- I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.

20:12.261 --> 20:14.894
YOU CAN TAKE CONTROL.
YOU CAN MAKE IT NOT HAPPEN.

20:14.896 --> 20:18.197
- I'VE KNOWN MY WHOLE LIFE
THAT THIS DAY WAS GOING TO COME.

20:18.199 --> 20:20.566
I TRIED TO CONTROL
THE DARK SIDE OF ME.

20:20.568 --> 20:24.002
I TRIED TO DO
GOOD THINGS, TO FIGHT EVIL,

20:24.004 --> 20:28.038
AND HOPED THAT WOULD SOMEHOW
MAKE UP FOR THE HORRIBLE THING
I'M DESTINED TO DO.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.973
- BUT NO ONE KNOWS
THEIR DESTINY.

20:29.975 --> 20:32.108
THERE ARE THINGS
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.477
- THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I DIDN'T KNOW,

20:34.479 --> 20:38.247
LIKE HOW I WOULD MAKE
SUCH WONDERFUL FRIENDS.

20:38.249 --> 20:42.317
ALL I WANTED WAS TO MAKE
YOUR LAST DAY PERFECT.

20:42.319 --> 20:47.221
INSTEAD, YOU SPENT IT
WORRYING ABOUT ME.

20:48.390 --> 20:50.356
- THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

20:50.358 --> 20:55.127
- AND AS MY FRIENDS,
YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO.

20:59.199 --> 21:01.265
- RRR!

21:07.039 --> 21:09.739
RRR!

HE COMES TO CLAIM,
HE COMES TO SIRE,

21:37.797 --> 21:40.697
THE END OF ALL THINGS MORTAL.
