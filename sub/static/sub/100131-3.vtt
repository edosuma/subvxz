00:51.426 --> 00:52.427
Chet-chet!

00:59.518 --> 01:00.602
Chet-chet-chet!

02:20.557 --> 02:22.476
Still recognize your melody...

02:23.810 --> 02:26.063
the way your right is heavier
than your left.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.151
But now you shift uneasily
from foot to foot.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.530
You never used to. You were solid.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.200
Life, experience...

02:39.493 --> 02:41.578
they rock me from side to side.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.002
Welcome home, Tamacti Jun.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.094
Majesty.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.526
My tour of duty is done.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.363
My commission was for 20 summers.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.158
And those summers have turned to winter.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.077
You brought taxes and tribute?

03:23.829 --> 03:24.955
Yes.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.849
The axles groaned through the mountains.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.686
A hundred carts, God bone, grain,

03:47.769 --> 03:52.357
diamond for axes, axes for wood, slaves.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.320
You're a fine tax collector.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.699
But you're not a finder of witches.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.912
In every village, I interrogated,

04:07.122 --> 04:11.877
presagers would say, "Jerlamarel.
No, no, sir. I don't know that name."

04:12.794 --> 04:15.088
I burned all who lied to me.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.339
You spread his name.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.966
In order to find him.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.761
You were a prophet for him?

04:22.638 --> 04:25.140
Gathering people,
telling them about his power,

04:25.224 --> 04:27.643
giving them his name,
scattering his seeds?

04:30.896 --> 04:32.856
As your Witchfinder general,

04:33.607 --> 04:38.153
I have come to report that
I have failed my queen...

04:39.696 --> 04:42.032
and I accept the natural consequence.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.243
But I ask only this:

04:45.160 --> 04:48.872
instead of execution on the altar...

04:49.998 --> 04:54.586
you allow me to take my own life...

04:55.504 --> 04:57.673
in the manner of a warrior.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.051
Your Majesty, the people are rejoicing.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.847
The elders are dividing the spoils.
The warehouses are being filled.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.933
A market for the slaves is put into ropes.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.480
Our most exalted general has returned.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.357
Tamacti Jun?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.069
Yes. It is I, Tamacti Jun...

05:19.945 --> 05:24.366
who have returned with a hundred carts
when it should've been a hundred and one.

05:25.242 --> 05:29.872
Your Majesty, his failure to find one man,
one heretic,

05:29.955 --> 05:32.958
must be balanced against
this sound of hundreds calling his name.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.419
Lord Dune, go to the high altar.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.922
Tell the people to gather.
I'll speak to them.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.383
I, too, will rejoice.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.349
Tamacti Jun.

05:58.734 --> 05:59.860
Yes.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.283
In recognition
of 20 years' loyal service...

06:07.868 --> 06:09.369
you have my permission...

06:11.830 --> 06:13.373
to take your own life.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.795
Farewell.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.919
Lord Dune, why are you still here?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.841
You could have ordered him to live.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.304
Tamacti Jun understands the nature
of his failure better than you.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.851
Outside,
they're celebrating their own doom.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.561
One man lost.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.770
No!

07:19.273 --> 07:20.983
Our power lost!

07:24.236 --> 07:28.574
Jerlamarel's a god striding across
the world, making more gods,

07:28.657 --> 07:30.492
who will make more gods!

07:34.496 --> 07:36.540
Tamacti Jun knows what is lost.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.417
Go.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.799
Tamacti Jun! Tamacti Jun!

07:47.134 --> 07:50.846
Come, come.
He's over there, under the tree.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.891
Who's where, under what tree?

07:56.476 --> 07:57.644
Turkeys.

07:58.187 --> 08:01.273
So, you go around
and drive them towards me.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.192
Ready?

08:04.735 --> 08:06.111
Hush, Daddy.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.613
Feel.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.406
I made something.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.951
From the books, for hunting.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.997
Listen.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.711
And learn.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.306
-I got it. Come.
-What?

08:35.599 --> 08:38.433
I read in one of the books from the box

08:38.519 --> 08:43.565
something very interesting about
the people who used to live in America.

08:44.483 --> 08:45.734
What is America?

08:46.151 --> 08:48.987
This is just the beginning, Daddy.
I've read so much.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.698
With the right machines and enough power,

08:51.782 --> 08:56.078
we could make weapons much
more powerful than what I just used,

08:56.161 --> 08:58.539
to kill a hundred in one hour.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.124
Or they had these bombs--

09:01.583 --> 09:04.628
Things called "bombs"
that could blow up whole cities.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.381
Half your words are book words to me,
love, and they mean nothing to me.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.550
Well, what about this turkey?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.051
Turkey means dinner.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.095
Every day I could go out.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.056
I could get deer, even.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.643
Just like Jerlamarel.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.355
You say deer.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.111
And how exactly would I explain that
to your mother?

09:29.194 --> 09:32.906
That is exactly what Kofun says.
Everything we learn, he wants to hide.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.786
You know I enjoy a tasty deer.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.038
I don't even like turkey.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.208
-Makes me sleepy.
-I know, Papa.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.648
What are you doing?

10:07.274 --> 10:11.486
I could kill any one of them
at any time...

10:13.197 --> 10:14.907
and they wouldn't even know what it was.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.535
They'd say it is
the God Flame's vengeance.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.913
Even though we know

10:21.455 --> 10:25.709
the God Flame is
a bunch of gas 93 million miles away...

10:26.919 --> 10:28.837
-burning in outer--
-Stop!

10:30.005 --> 10:32.049
He didn't leave us books
so that we can make weapons.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.552
How do you know? Why did he
leave us books? What was his reason?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.095
Explain, Professor.

10:37.596 --> 10:38.597
Stop.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.394
Do you think about it?

10:44.478 --> 10:45.604
Think about what?

10:46.271 --> 10:48.190
What it'll be like when we meet him.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.108
If we meet him.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.741
This will guide us.
It's a picture of the world.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.579
Look,
I've already worked out where we are.

11:02.663 --> 11:06.667
See, our river flows
to this bigger river called Mississippi.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.751
And then...

11:09.962 --> 11:12.631
this was once a city called Pittsburgh.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.216
-Pittsburgh.
-I think it was--

11:14.299 --> 11:17.135
Industrial town known for the production
of steel manufactured goods.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.637
Goddens' History of America.

11:18.720 --> 11:25.060
Our father left us with the knowledge
and wisdom from all ages of humanity,

11:25.143 --> 11:28.021
and yet, somehow, Kofun,
you make it boring.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.898
"Boring" is bows and arrows.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.733
"Boring" is reading and not doing.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.204
-Chet-chet!
-Chet-chet-chet!

11:44.872 --> 11:47.499
Last night, a baby was born...

11:49.084 --> 11:50.502
to Souter Bax.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.756
But the baby was not whole.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.719
The baby was not formed human.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.346
Because you witches cursed me!

12:06.643 --> 12:08.270
You should burn them...

12:10.272 --> 12:11.690
not follow them.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.444
What came from her was...

12:16.987 --> 12:18.071
a devil.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.740
And it's their fault.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.618
The baby was not born that way
because of any curse.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.328
God Flame, welcome her.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.624
It was born that way
for want of fresh blood.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.419
When so few are together for so long,

12:33.003 --> 12:35.172
the blood of the tribe thickens.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.550
We have known through the generations
that without new blood,

12:38.634 --> 12:39.927
the monsters would come.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.972
-Simple genetics. DNA clusters--
-Hush, Haniwa.

12:44.765 --> 12:48.185
This baby is a warning to us.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.729
And we should heed that warning.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.609
We need to share ourselves and be shared.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.944
No.

12:57.027 --> 13:01.323
We must go out again and join
the festival, dance away the monsters.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.909
We have avoided the festivals
for a reason.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.995
Out in the world, we are hunted.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.956
Here, we are safe.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.418
Perhaps here, we might be a little smarter
about choosing partners.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.838
The need is deep, Baba Voss.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.299
New blood is needed here,
and has for a long time.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.843
I said, no.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.474
These people have been held here
for so long.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.310
Held here? Held here?

13:30.978 --> 13:32.354
They have been protected here.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.815
The one does not out-rule the other,

13:35.482 --> 13:38.819
especially since so many of them dispute

13:38.902 --> 13:41.780
whether we are here to protect them
from the Witchfinder,

13:41.864 --> 13:44.908
or to protect your children from them.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.204
They have done without medicine
while sick.

13:49.288 --> 13:52.416
They have done without trade
while wanting.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.043
They have done without.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.714
And if you forbid them from travel...

14:00.382 --> 14:02.551
they will start leaving on their own.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.237
Our people wandering the countryside
on their own.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.283
They'll lead the Witchfinder to us
in no time.

14:27.743 --> 14:31.371
Then maybe it's better we have some
control over where they wander

14:31.872 --> 14:33.957
and who they come in contact with.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.586
What do you propose, my love?

14:42.341 --> 14:44.760
I know the way to a festival.

14:46.720 --> 14:53.060
They have some medicine, goods,
and new blood.

14:58.065 --> 15:03.153
The only way to protect Haniwa and Kofun
is to make sure that this place is secure.

15:04.613 --> 15:08.033
And if that means we have to control
where the Alkenny goes...

15:09.618 --> 15:11.286
then that's what we'll do.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.659
I'll be told when it's done?

15:51.743 --> 15:53.078
Yes, Your Majesty.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.726
It is done?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.229
News from the Sun Grave, Your Majesty.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.024
News?

17:00.521 --> 17:01.855
Great God Flame,

17:02.689 --> 17:06.068
accept my spark into your flame

17:06.693 --> 17:10.030
and let it rise to meet you.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.434
It's not over.

17:46.608 --> 17:47.943
It's not over.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.204
We'll be gone for a week.
The festival's a few days' walk.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.582
Antia is going, and she's younger than us.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.960
Haniwa, I am not risking anyone
finding out about your gift.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.254
We've kept our secret safe here
for 17 summers.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.881
Well, not without suspicion.

18:08.964 --> 18:11.216
We're better at keeping secrets
than you know, Mama.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.426
Meaning what?

18:13.719 --> 18:16.221
You are not old enough to share
or spread your seeds.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.056
We don't want to share disgusting seeds.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.225
Well, then you should be happy to stay.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.686
Why would someone like me
want the seed of a blind man?

18:25.689 --> 18:26.773
Come here.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.526
I said, come here.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.992
Why would you speak this way?

18:38.869 --> 18:40.996
I don't know. I'm sorry.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.002
Because I love you all...

18:48.545 --> 18:50.214
and you all love me,

18:51.089 --> 18:53.634
I ignore certain voices in my head...

18:54.468 --> 18:56.553
because I know you would not lie to me.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.324
By accident of birth,
you were given the ability to see.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.994
Do not think you are superior
because others cannot.

19:22.037 --> 19:25.541
And keep your book words to yourself,
because sometimes those words are wicked.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.637
Mama, these flowers will rot
before I even get there.

19:39.263 --> 19:43.058
These flowers are for you,
to smell along the way,

19:43.141 --> 19:46.562
to find the feeling to enter
into the dance.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.647
Who says I'll dance?

19:49.064 --> 19:53.151
It's long past time, Bow.
Your father and I danced.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.361
Form up.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.530
-Baba?
-Love.

19:56.947 --> 19:59.825
Remember, Alkenny, let us be known as
"the people of the waterfall."

20:00.284 --> 20:01.994
Let us not speak of the past.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.375
Travel well.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.838
Hey.

20:54.922 --> 20:55.923
Haniwa.

20:56.632 --> 20:57.966
Slow down!

20:58.050 --> 21:00.052
We're upwind. They can't hear us.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.388
I'd like to keep it that way.

21:05.682 --> 21:06.683
Happy?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.150
Kofun.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.445
We're going to see the world.

21:39.550 --> 21:40.801
What is that?

21:42.302 --> 21:46.181
Maybe this is one of those places the
spaceship took off and went to the moon.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.060
Look. Look at that wheel.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.188
I don't remember reading
about cars that size.

21:56.859 --> 21:58.694
Come on, before it gets too dark.

22:27.181 --> 22:29.975
Fresh wool. Fine, like silk.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.144
Mesh to mend your clothes.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.716
I am the priest of the God Flame,

23:03.550 --> 23:08.722
brother of the fire,
who shapes me like God bone.

23:09.473 --> 23:12.976
Executor of God's will.

23:13.060 --> 23:16.146
We have built this temple of flame.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.650
We have brought witches to burn.

23:20.609 --> 23:24.488
All have been convicted
of having the power of light.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.198
A Witchfinder is here.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.366
Behold--

23:27.449 --> 23:29.701
No. This is something different.

23:29.785 --> 23:34.164
...as we turn the witches of light
into heat.

23:37.626 --> 23:38.627
Please.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.630
They can't even see.

23:42.256 --> 23:44.174
Look at their eyes.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.927
They're being burned for nothing.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.136
-Stop!
-Please.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.685
You're wrong! They can't even--

24:01.233 --> 24:05.988
The Witchfinder has missed us,
but his message has traveled.

24:07.573 --> 24:09.116
Made disciples.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.431
The children will never be safe.

24:34.141 --> 24:37.019
The children will be safe at home.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.315
Everyone thinks home is safe...

24:42.316 --> 24:43.525
until it isn't.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.328
Help!

26:18.412 --> 26:19.830
Haniwa!

26:56.491 --> 26:58.035
Strong.

27:00.829 --> 27:02.247
Young.

27:07.211 --> 27:08.462
Healthy...

27:09.963 --> 27:16.011
For once, these sheep
are not held behind their fences.

27:26.813 --> 27:27.814
Fethin?

27:32.319 --> 27:33.445
Fethin!

27:38.534 --> 27:39.743
Fethin!

27:44.122 --> 27:48.252
Slavers! Slavers!

27:48.335 --> 27:49.461
What is it?

27:49.545 --> 27:50.921
There's Slavers!

27:52.506 --> 27:56.927
They took my Fethin!
They took my little girl!

27:58.345 --> 27:59.721
Fethin!

28:02.641 --> 28:03.725
Fethin!

28:05.978 --> 28:08.272
They were Slavers!

28:09.606 --> 28:12.985
Mama. Mama, Papa, wake up. It's me.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.403
What are you doing here?

28:14.987 --> 28:16.655
Mama, I think something bad has--

28:16.738 --> 28:18.156
Where's Kofun?

28:19.324 --> 28:20.701
Where's Kofun?

28:21.201 --> 28:22.327
I think he's...

28:23.036 --> 28:24.454
I think he's been taken.

28:24.538 --> 28:25.581
By whom?

28:26.665 --> 28:28.792
I think he's been taken by Slavers.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.943
What do you think you're doing?

28:57.738 --> 28:59.114
Why have we stopped?

28:59.531 --> 29:01.617
The boy thought he'd take a break.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.668
-Something's wrong with him.
-I'll find out.

29:11.752 --> 29:12.920
No.

29:14.129 --> 29:15.339
I will.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.343
You scream, I will gut you.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.556
Can't you hear her? She's hurt.

29:25.349 --> 29:27.309
She keeps tripping, so I'm tripping.

29:28.352 --> 29:29.561
So, don't trip.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.563
No, please! She's bleeding.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.448
How do you know?

29:42.908 --> 29:44.243
I'm a Scentier.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.746
I can smell the blood. And she's limping.

29:50.791 --> 29:54.503
It is not her foot
my customers are interested in.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.341
A bit of spirit.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.680
This one will get a good price.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.182
Move!

30:19.903 --> 30:23.991
There! I see smoke.
They follow the Sage Road.

30:24.074 --> 30:25.492
They will stray from it.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.119
For you, but not for me.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.121
They will leave a trail. I will see it.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.874
-I will gather warriors. We pursue!
-There's no time.

30:34.084 --> 30:37.462
Few men will come. I need them back.

30:38.172 --> 30:39.923
Haniwa, lead the way.

31:47.324 --> 31:49.493
Hemlock. It's theirs.

31:51.245 --> 31:52.329
You certain?

31:52.412 --> 31:53.413
Absolutely.

31:56.959 --> 31:59.294
Mama? Papa?

32:00.170 --> 32:01.547
There's a message here.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.132
Kofun left a message.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.095
What message?

32:08.178 --> 32:09.429
How could he leave a message?

32:12.057 --> 32:14.226
You're just going to have to trust me.

32:15.477 --> 32:19.147
Trust you? What message?

32:27.781 --> 32:30.367
Kofun has written a message,
and I can read it.

32:34.621 --> 32:36.832
No. How do you know those words?

32:39.168 --> 32:42.337
How do you know "written" and "read"?

32:45.340 --> 32:47.009
It's knowledge from the box, Mama.

32:48.468 --> 32:49.678
We opened it.

32:50.345 --> 32:52.181
We have learned to read and write.

32:53.182 --> 32:55.184
And we read all the books he left behind.

32:59.563 --> 33:00.606
Who opened it?

33:03.150 --> 33:04.401
I did.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.490
What does the message say?

33:12.826 --> 33:15.204
-Mama, I--
-My son is missing!

33:15.287 --> 33:17.706
I want him back! So, what does it say?

33:47.444 --> 33:48.445
Guards!

34:07.965 --> 34:08.966
Sit!

34:22.187 --> 34:23.397
What's your name?

34:28.110 --> 34:29.610
Kofun.

34:30.654 --> 34:32.114
My name is Fethin.

34:34.699 --> 34:39.746
Did you really think telling the Slavers
I was hurt would make them help me?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.293
Okay, you're welcome.

34:45.878 --> 34:48.589
No, I didn't mean it like that.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.675
Thank you.

35:00.184 --> 35:03.270
Careful. Many rocks. Many rocks.

35:04.563 --> 35:05.564
Mama.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.233
I'm good.

35:08.317 --> 35:09.401
Yes.

35:09.484 --> 35:14.406
I see ahead,
smoke coming from inside a structure.

35:14.489 --> 35:16.491
-Are the towers made of God bone?
-Yes.

35:16.575 --> 35:18.744
It's where they hold the slaves
before they sell them.

35:18.827 --> 35:21.288
If I don't get to him now,
he'll be sold to the market.

35:21.371 --> 35:22.706
How do you know, Papa?

35:30.047 --> 35:31.423
I know this place...

35:33.884 --> 35:36.345
because my father was a Slaver...

35:38.472 --> 35:40.182
and his father before him.

35:43.018 --> 35:45.771
And for a time, so was I.

35:52.903 --> 35:56.031
It's not as you think, Haniwa.
Your father was different.

35:56.114 --> 35:59.117
Do not tell her that. It isn't true.

36:01.745 --> 36:06.416
I was raised to chain and whip

36:06.500 --> 36:09.795
and beat and sell innocent people.

36:12.756 --> 36:14.591
He taught me how to torture.

36:17.594 --> 36:22.808
But I've buried that part of me,
that man...

36:23.851 --> 36:26.979
deep down in a hole.

36:28.355 --> 36:30.983
But now I must do something
I swore I would never do.

36:32.192 --> 36:33.193
What?

36:35.529 --> 36:36.822
Wake him up.

36:40.409 --> 36:42.661
-Papa, I can go with you. I have my bow.
-No.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.163
No, my love.

36:45.622 --> 36:47.666
You must not see what I'll become.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.214
I will get Kofun back.

37:52.105 --> 37:55.108
I will get mighty God bone for you.

37:56.735 --> 37:58.487
Mighty God bone.

38:38.694 --> 38:39.736
Chet-chet!

38:42.865 --> 38:44.283
What was that?

39:23.363 --> 39:24.781
Close your eyes.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.234
Wech.

40:47.573 --> 40:50.325
The great Baba Voss.

40:52.578 --> 40:54.329
The great coward.

40:56.498 --> 40:57.666
The great...

40:59.168 --> 41:00.377
deserter.

41:03.672 --> 41:06.717
Finally, my day has come.

41:08.510 --> 41:12.055
And I will have your head.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.808
Upokokohua.

41:14.892 --> 41:16.476
Haere Mai!

41:22.399 --> 41:23.525
Pick it up.

41:25.444 --> 41:26.862
Papa, watch out!

41:38.373 --> 41:40.125
Your boy!

42:50.779 --> 42:51.822
No...

43:03.750 --> 43:04.835
Papa.

43:20.767 --> 43:21.810
It's me.

43:22.561 --> 43:23.937
Mama, it's me.

43:25.189 --> 43:26.440
Mama, it's all right.

43:27.107 --> 43:28.734
-Kofun?
-It's all right.

43:29.276 --> 43:30.277
Kofun.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.612
Mama, it's all right.

43:33.780 --> 43:34.781
It's all right.

43:34.865 --> 43:37.034
Haniwa. Haniwa.

43:37.117 --> 43:39.786
I'm here, Mama. We're all here.

43:42.497 --> 43:43.665
I'm sorry.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.210
I'm so sorry.

43:47.336 --> 43:49.254
-I'm sorry about the box.
-It's okay.

43:51.423 --> 43:52.591
I'm sorry.

44:05.270 --> 44:06.438
Mama?

44:37.719 --> 44:38.929
-Mag--
-No.

44:46.854 --> 44:47.855
Mama!

44:48.480 --> 44:49.565
No.

46:03.347 --> 46:04.431
Mama?

46:07.726 --> 46:11.104
All we have learned from our books,

46:12.064 --> 46:16.109
and all we have learned
from the festival...

46:17.236 --> 46:20.364
all we have learned in 17 summers...

46:22.866 --> 46:24.993
None of it makes me wanna leave here.

46:28.705 --> 46:29.957
And Haniwa?

46:31.333 --> 46:32.501
What of you?

46:39.383 --> 46:40.759
A man is dead.

46:42.594 --> 46:43.929
A bad man...

46:45.180 --> 46:48.392
but still, he's dead.

46:49.977 --> 46:51.186
I killed him

46:51.979 --> 46:57.317
because I knew I had the power to kill him
and not be caught.

46:59.736 --> 47:01.196
All that I've learned...

47:02.447 --> 47:03.907
all that I've read...

47:04.950 --> 47:06.118
all of it...

47:08.453 --> 47:10.873
all of it makes me want to leave here.

47:13.250 --> 47:16.044
But, Mama...

47:18.297 --> 47:20.215
I'm scared of...

47:21.383 --> 47:25.470
what I am and what I can do.

47:25.554 --> 47:30.601
And I just want you to know
that I love you, Mama.

47:32.186 --> 47:33.687
And I love you, Papa.

47:34.771 --> 47:38.150
And one day,
my big mouth might get me burned.

47:38.984 --> 47:39.985
No.

47:42.905 --> 47:44.156
I already know.

47:48.702 --> 47:49.786
I know.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.291
I know you.

47:56.335 --> 47:57.711
My babies...

48:01.256 --> 48:02.966
Because I knew him.

48:05.969 --> 48:08.764
And it's time I told you about him.

48:11.058 --> 48:12.476
Jerlamarel.

48:14.770 --> 48:16.522
It's time for the truth...

48:17.940 --> 48:19.191
for all of us.

48:23.445 --> 48:25.113
He was a good man.

48:26.615 --> 48:30.035
But sometimes power can consume goodness.

48:34.414 --> 48:35.916
I'll tell you about him.

48:36.583 --> 48:40.128
Baba, go and get Paris.

48:40.671 --> 48:42.214
She should hear this too.
