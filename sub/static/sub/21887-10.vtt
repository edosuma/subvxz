00:00.039 --> 00:01.171
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:01.234 --> 00:04.195
OSWALD: You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.296
- Don't ever betray me again.
- Never.

00:06.367 --> 00:08.055
I need to know what Sofia's planning,

00:08.151 --> 00:09.717
and who she is planning it with.

00:09.745 --> 00:11.898
Plain, dumb Ed.

00:11.980 --> 00:13.613
I would like you to go to the Narrows

00:13.649 --> 00:15.615
and bundle him up, bring him back to me.

00:15.651 --> 00:16.850
They're the ones that are the problem.

00:17.886 --> 00:19.486
They work for Penguin.

00:19.521 --> 00:21.288
I would like to announce

00:21.323 --> 00:23.990
that we just quit working for Penguin.

00:24.026 --> 00:25.192
This is your turf, now.

00:26.328 --> 00:27.527
HARPER: What is he doing to them?

00:27.563 --> 00:28.595
GORDON: He's cooking them.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.863
PYG: They're people pies.

00:29.898 --> 00:32.131
Eat the pies, or the boy dies.

00:33.168 --> 00:34.568
(grunting)

00:35.604 --> 00:36.870
No! (shouts)

00:37.583 --> 00:38.605
SOFIA: Jim!

00:44.513 --> 00:46.680
GORDON: The suspect known
as the Pyg is in custody.

00:46.715 --> 00:49.015
The GCPD kept its promise.

00:49.051 --> 00:50.217
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

00:50.252 --> 00:51.985
I never will be.

00:53.056 --> 00:54.921
OSWALD: Did you find anything out?

00:54.957 --> 00:57.591
"I saw Sofia kissing the policeman."

00:57.626 --> 01:00.026
She will answer for what she's done.

01:02.030 --> 01:05.532
(old-timey music playing in distance)

01:06.197 --> 01:10.104
- ♪ I should be happy... ♪
- MAN: Thursday.

01:10.205 --> 01:14.416
Thursday is my day. Thursday's my day.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.625
You can't, you can't be here.

01:18.158 --> 01:20.681
Thursday's my day.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.315

01:30.055 --> 01:41.002

- ♪ Ave Maria... ♪

01:42.271 --> 01:45.238

Ooh, yeah.

01:52.915 --> 01:54.281

01:54.316 --> 01:56.617
I don't like that song.

01:58.353 --> 02:00.453
My ma used to beat me to it.

02:00.489 --> 02:03.323
It was playing when I killed her.

02:03.358 --> 02:06.126
(laughs softly)

02:06.161 --> 02:08.961
So, now, you turn it off.

02:08.997 --> 02:11.965
Or I do the same to you.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.734
Why did your mother beat you?

02:16.939 --> 02:19.906
Were you a naughty boy?

02:19.942 --> 02:22.842
Did you soil your trousers?

02:25.514 --> 02:27.280
Was it... (stuttering)

02:27.316 --> 02:28.481
a stutter?

02:29.038 --> 02:31.151
Perhaps?

02:35.524 --> 02:37.724
Open the gate, open the gate,
open the gate now.

02:37.759 --> 02:39.492
Try it.

02:39.528 --> 02:41.528
Everybody calm down.

02:41.563 --> 02:43.730
(groans)

02:43.765 --> 02:45.332
(gate rattling)

02:45.367 --> 02:48.034
GUARD: Back off. Back off of the gate.

02:48.070 --> 02:51.397
I really wish you hadn't done that.

02:55.177 --> 02:57.978
(creaking, clicking)

02:58.013 --> 02:59.879
(grunts)

02:59.915 --> 03:02.849
I paid a fortune to look this good.

03:02.884 --> 03:04.384
(yelling)

03:08.523 --> 03:10.323
("Ave Maria" continues playing)

03:18.100 --> 03:19.466
(alarm ringing)

03:19.501 --> 03:20.900
The gate is locked!

03:20.936 --> 03:23.570
Everybody, just stay where you are.

03:23.605 --> 03:25.505
All right, open the gate. That's enough.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.539
Okay, it's over.

03:26.575 --> 03:28.375
Just open the gate and let us in.

03:45.675 --> 03:48.428
The doctors at Arkham
took these after the fight.

03:48.463 --> 03:50.263
The Pyg had titanium plates
surgically grafted

03:50.299 --> 03:51.998
onto the bones of his face.

03:52.034 --> 03:55.168
The result of which radically
changed his appearance.

03:55.203 --> 03:57.611
When we booked him,
his fingerprints were burnt off.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.206
I've seen it before on criminals
that want to hide their identity.

04:00.242 --> 04:02.742
- But never anything like this.
- And that's not all.

04:02.778 --> 04:04.077
The doctors also noted scar tissue

04:04.112 --> 04:05.779
behind his ears and along his neckline,

04:05.814 --> 04:07.947
indicating he's had multiple surgeries.

04:07.983 --> 04:10.283
That explains why we couldn't
I.D. him off his photo.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.246
This doesn't make any sense.

04:12.301 --> 04:13.550
The Pyg is a glory hound.

04:13.575 --> 04:14.721
Everything he's done,

04:14.756 --> 04:16.255
it's all been about
grabbing the spotlight.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.791
Classic sociopath behavior.

04:17.826 --> 04:20.260
So why doesn't he want us
to know who he really is?

04:20.295 --> 04:24.297
Now is the time he should be
taking credit for his crimes.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.067
Can you use this X-ray
to reconstruct his face?

04:27.102 --> 04:29.502
See what he looked like
before he had any work done?

04:29.538 --> 04:32.138
It's certainly possible,
but it will take some time.

04:32.174 --> 04:33.640
Get started.

04:33.675 --> 04:36.409
I want to know who the Pyg really is.

04:39.281 --> 04:40.613
Morning, Cap.

04:40.649 --> 04:42.282
Harper.

04:42.317 --> 04:43.583
How's the shoulder?

04:43.618 --> 04:45.952
This? Oh, just a scratch.

04:45.987 --> 04:48.121
You got a visitor.

04:50.659 --> 04:52.659
Thanks.

04:54.996 --> 04:57.130
Sofia.

04:57.165 --> 04:58.898
What are you doing here?

04:58.934 --> 05:01.534
I haven't heard from you in a few days.

05:01.570 --> 05:04.798
I didn't realize I was supposed to call.

05:05.307 --> 05:07.607
I figured, after the other night,

05:07.642 --> 05:10.076
we were gonna start
seeing each other again.

05:10.112 --> 05:12.779
We're not.

05:12.814 --> 05:14.614
I get it.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.249
You're worried about Penguin
finding out about us,

05:16.284 --> 05:18.485
that I made you captain.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.019
You don't have to be.

05:20.055 --> 05:21.488
I already told him.

05:22.524 --> 05:24.324
I'm sorry, you did what?

05:24.359 --> 05:25.592
I have it under control.

05:25.627 --> 05:27.260
Is that what you think?

05:27.295 --> 05:29.362
It's what I know.

05:29.398 --> 05:32.499
I'm going to remove
Penguin from the picture,

05:32.534 --> 05:35.402
and when I do, I want us to be together.

05:37.072 --> 05:39.205
It's not gonna work, Sofia.

05:39.241 --> 05:41.669
Even if Penguin is out of the picture,

05:41.895 --> 05:44.411
I just don't see a way forward
for us. I'm sorry.

05:51.052 --> 05:53.052
(siren wailing, people shouting)

05:54.489 --> 05:55.955
BOOKIE: I run the dog races.

05:55.991 --> 05:57.457
He runs the cock fights.

05:57.492 --> 05:59.692
Now he's coming in,
muscling on my business.

05:59.728 --> 06:00.960
I got mouths to feed.

06:00.996 --> 06:02.557
BOOKIE: You race those dogs again,

06:02.632 --> 06:04.268
and I'll slit your damn throat.

06:04.315 --> 06:06.032
- All right. Enough.
- (growling)

06:06.067 --> 06:08.535
(quietly): If she stabs him,
it solves the issue.

06:08.570 --> 06:12.572
I started this court so we could
work out disputes peacefully.

06:12.607 --> 06:16.209
This is how things are gonna be
done from now on, understood?

06:16.244 --> 06:18.912
Now, you're both admitting
to having down months.

06:18.947 --> 06:21.519
Seems the only solution
is for you to partner up.

06:21.983 --> 06:24.350
Both of you work together,
you stay strong.

06:26.254 --> 06:28.421
Okay. That's settled. Thank you.

06:28.457 --> 06:29.923
Moving on. Next.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.724
THOMPKINS: Wait.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.092
How's your daughter?

06:35.063 --> 06:37.217
Fever came down.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.232
Thanks to you, Doc.

06:39.576 --> 06:41.267
Good.

06:46.274 --> 06:49.075
These bums are so lucky to have you.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.511
You cure their children,
you solve their problems.

06:51.546 --> 06:53.079
I haven't forgotten about you, Ed.

06:53.114 --> 06:56.583
Yes, you say that and
yet, I remain a moron.

06:56.798 --> 06:59.632
I said I would fix you. And I will.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.687
MAN: Make way.

07:00.722 --> 07:04.657
Oh... out of my way!
Out of my way, I need to see the doc!

07:05.021 --> 07:06.518
THOMPKINS: What happened?

07:07.429 --> 07:10.930
Sampson sent his thugs to my
shop demanding protection money.

07:10.966 --> 07:12.765
I told them no.

07:12.801 --> 07:14.767
I said this is your neighborhood now.

07:14.803 --> 07:16.402
I'm sorry, who's Sampson?

07:16.438 --> 07:18.071
He controls the territory
just south of here.

07:18.747 --> 07:21.786
All right, go to the clinic.
I'll stitch you up.

07:23.278 --> 07:26.012
You know, this was bound to happen.

07:26.047 --> 07:27.780
You're a new leader in the Narrows.

07:27.816 --> 07:29.282
Sampson's just testing you.

07:29.317 --> 07:31.888
But, you have to show him

07:31.950 --> 07:33.316
and these people

07:33.364 --> 07:34.830
that you can't be pushed around.

07:34.896 --> 07:36.956
What, should I send Grundy
to rip his arms off?

07:36.992 --> 07:38.057
Look at him.

07:38.093 --> 07:40.293
- (growling)
- It's what he lives for.

07:40.328 --> 07:42.962
I'm asking these people
to settle things amicably.

07:42.998 --> 07:44.397
I can't just be a hypocrite

07:44.432 --> 07:46.499
and send Grundy
every time I have a problem.

07:46.535 --> 07:47.667
(sighs)

07:47.702 --> 07:49.720
Okay. What would you like to do?

07:53.174 --> 07:55.174
(thunder rumbles)

07:58.561 --> 08:00.179
Hello, Sofia.

08:02.651 --> 08:03.850
(chuckles)

08:03.885 --> 08:06.686
Oswald, what a pleasant surprise.

08:07.715 --> 08:09.708
Oh, I assure you,

08:09.825 --> 08:11.151
dear,

08:11.435 --> 08:15.161
there is nothing pleasant about it.

08:15.196 --> 08:18.531
I have continually
been suspicious of you.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.966
And yet,

08:20.001 --> 08:21.801
at every turn,

08:21.836 --> 08:24.771
you always had the perfect explanation

08:24.806 --> 08:26.873
to put my mind at ease.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.942
But now,

08:29.529 --> 08:33.880
I finally have proof
that you are my enemy.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.929
You lied to me.

08:37.172 --> 08:39.586
You told me you hated Gordon.

08:41.323 --> 08:43.655
(quietly): You are his lover.

08:43.692 --> 08:45.992
Martin saw you kissing him
after the party.

08:46.027 --> 08:48.328
That's-that's ridiculous.

08:48.363 --> 08:50.029
I'm not sure what Martin thought he saw,

08:50.065 --> 08:52.198
but I can assure you, it was no kiss.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.967
Enough of your lies.

08:56.137 --> 08:58.264
Our entire friendship,

08:58.452 --> 09:00.907
the intimacies we shared,

09:00.942 --> 09:02.475
they were nothing more

09:02.510 --> 09:04.877
- than a pathetic charade.
- Well, Oswald, I swear.

09:04.913 --> 09:06.813
I swear, I care for you deeply.

09:06.848 --> 09:09.248
Ha! Oh, I wish that were true.

09:09.284 --> 09:10.917
Mm. But...

09:10.952 --> 09:13.019
after Martin told me
about you and Gordon,

09:13.044 --> 09:15.988
I did a little digging
into your boyfriend.

09:16.191 --> 09:18.925
Interesting, he took a trip

09:18.960 --> 09:22.595
down South shortly
before you arrived in Gotham.

09:23.442 --> 09:24.654
Coincidence?

09:24.817 --> 09:26.265
I think not.

09:26.301 --> 09:28.534
So you see,

09:28.570 --> 09:32.905
I know that the two of you have
been plotting to destroy me

09:32.941 --> 09:35.108
from the very beginning.

09:39.748 --> 09:41.581
Bravo, Oswald.

09:43.218 --> 09:45.385
Do you know I was warned
you were a mastermind?

09:45.420 --> 09:46.786
(clicks tongue)

09:46.821 --> 09:48.187
Turns out, you were an easy mark.

09:48.223 --> 09:50.923
It is truly amazing
what you can accomplish

09:50.959 --> 09:53.760
with goulash and a good foot rub.

10:00.135 --> 10:01.768
Now I see the real you.

10:04.606 --> 10:06.406
(sniffles)

10:06.441 --> 10:08.808
I was blind to your manipulations.

10:08.843 --> 10:11.711
But today I'm going to
correct that mistake.

10:11.746 --> 10:14.584
You will tell me the full
extent of your plan.

10:14.638 --> 10:16.412
If your father was involved,

10:16.467 --> 10:18.389
which of my captains you have turned,

10:18.452 --> 10:20.553
and how you intend
to rid me from the city.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.555
Bring him out.

10:22.590 --> 10:25.625
Allow me to introduce you
to The Dentist.

10:26.628 --> 10:28.594
And he is not the kind who gives out

10:28.630 --> 10:30.874
lollipops after the visit.

10:34.814 --> 10:37.148
(birds squawking)

10:39.160 --> 10:40.660
(lock buzzes)

10:40.685 --> 10:42.244
Captain Gordon.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.909
I wondered if my little
scuffle would bring you here.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.102
I'm so glad it did.

10:46.219 --> 10:48.062
I've missed our little chats.

10:48.133 --> 10:51.847
Good. Then you can start by
telling me who you really are.

10:52.509 --> 10:54.249
Don't you know?

10:55.753 --> 10:59.521
Jim, I'm a reflection of you.

11:04.729 --> 11:06.995
I don't see it.

11:08.699 --> 11:09.998
(gasps lightly)

11:10.034 --> 11:13.202
(chuckles, sighs)

11:13.237 --> 11:15.583
James, you swine.

11:19.076 --> 11:21.844
(metal clicks)

11:21.879 --> 11:23.512
(sighs)

11:23.547 --> 11:25.447
I want to know who's hiding
behind that mask.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.159
What you see is what you get.

11:29.284 --> 11:32.511
What I see is someone
who craves attention.

11:33.057 --> 11:35.891
So why are you concealing
your true identity?

11:35.926 --> 11:37.326
Don't you want to take the credit

11:37.361 --> 11:38.732
for all your brilliant crimes?

11:38.786 --> 11:40.786
Oh, I get all the credit.

11:41.065 --> 11:45.033
The whole town has gone hog wild
for the Pyg.

11:45.069 --> 11:47.436
- (snorts)
- Not since I caught you.

11:47.471 --> 11:49.772
You're yesterday's news.

11:49.807 --> 11:51.874
It's not true.

11:51.909 --> 11:53.275
This is Gotham.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.244
You're a second-class psychopath

11:55.279 --> 11:56.857
compared to what we've got.

11:57.255 --> 12:00.223
Jerome Valeska, Fish Mooney, Penguin...

12:00.384 --> 12:02.451
they have staying power.

12:02.486 --> 12:04.420
- You don't.
- You're wrong.

12:04.465 --> 12:08.734
I terrified this whole city for months.

12:08.759 --> 12:12.127
- People will remember that.
- No, they won't.

12:12.163 --> 12:15.197
In fact, they've already forgotten you.

12:15.232 --> 12:18.467
But not you, Jim.

12:18.502 --> 12:21.136
- You're here.
- A final visit.

12:21.179 --> 12:25.247
Now I'm gonna walk out that door
and never think about you again.

12:25.276 --> 12:27.662
(chuckles) Mind games.

12:28.012 --> 12:31.983
You really think
that's going to work on me?

12:33.663 --> 12:35.647
Guard, we're done here.

12:35.717 --> 12:38.805
- (keys jangling)
- James, we're not done here.

12:38.856 --> 12:40.405
Have a nice life.

12:41.125 --> 12:44.311
(in Southern accent):
Don't you walk out on me.

12:46.664 --> 12:49.272
You will never forget me.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.099
I promise you that.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.002
(whispers): There you are.

13:02.046 --> 13:03.145
(door locks)

13:03.180 --> 13:05.180
♪ ♪

13:16.360 --> 13:17.893
(gun hammer clicks)

13:22.233 --> 13:23.699
SAMPSON: So...

13:24.389 --> 13:26.171
you're Doc.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.670
I heard you had a giant.
I figured you might've

13:28.706 --> 13:30.842
brought him along with you
rather than this, uh...

13:30.981 --> 13:32.107
- has-been.
- Excuse me.

13:32.142 --> 13:33.742
(gun hammers clicking)

13:35.212 --> 13:38.547
Why would I bring Grundy along
for a friendly conversation?

13:39.684 --> 13:41.683
Look, I understand
you had a deal with Cherry

13:41.719 --> 13:43.852
where you left her people alone.

13:43.888 --> 13:46.855
I expect you to honor the same with me.

13:46.891 --> 13:49.224
Why would I do that?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.360
You're not even from the Narrows.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.162
You have no idea
how things work around here.

13:54.198 --> 13:58.300
Maybe you're right, but I do
know that you love money.

13:58.335 --> 14:01.169
I'm willing to offer you
ten percent of fight night.

14:01.205 --> 14:02.838
SAMPSON: You just don't get it, huh?

14:02.873 --> 14:04.640
I'm not negotiating.

14:04.675 --> 14:05.841
I'm taking.

14:05.876 --> 14:08.243
I'm taking the clinic.

14:08.279 --> 14:10.579
I'm taking the club.

14:10.614 --> 14:13.382
I'm taking your whole damn neighborhood.

14:15.123 --> 14:17.052
Okay, we tried this your way.

14:17.087 --> 14:18.487
Let's use Grundy.

14:18.513 --> 14:20.780
(coughing)

14:22.660 --> 14:25.020
Well, that doesn't sound so good.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.166
You cough up blood yet?

14:27.264 --> 14:28.730
What's it to you?

14:28.766 --> 14:30.832
Bad case of Narrows Lung going around.

14:30.868 --> 14:33.268
- (fly buzzing)
- What the hell is that? (coughs)

14:33.304 --> 14:34.903
It's a new virus.

14:34.939 --> 14:36.572
I've seen it kill a few people already.

14:36.607 --> 14:38.206
- (coughs)
- First you cough up blood

14:38.242 --> 14:39.675
and within a few days you're dead,

14:39.710 --> 14:40.842
unless you have treatment.

14:41.103 --> 14:42.752
I'll sweeten the deal.

14:42.807 --> 14:44.913
I will doctor your people
free of charge.

14:44.949 --> 14:47.149
(laughs)

14:47.184 --> 14:49.585
You're not gonna get
a better offer than that.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.588
(laughs, coughs)

14:52.623 --> 14:55.190
All right.

14:55.225 --> 14:57.192
I'll be back in a few days

14:57.227 --> 14:58.961
to negotiate with whoever
takes your place

14:58.996 --> 15:01.430
after you drown in your own blood.

15:05.269 --> 15:07.035
Tell you what, Doc.

15:07.544 --> 15:12.374
Make it 30% of fight night,
you got yourself a deal.

15:12.409 --> 15:13.809
That's too much. Don't take it.

15:14.406 --> 15:16.393
(coughing)

15:19.116 --> 15:20.925
Come by the clinic later.

15:21.151 --> 15:23.448
We'll see about that cough.

15:24.088 --> 15:25.320
(groans)

15:28.166 --> 15:31.467
Your teeth are quite lovely.

15:31.629 --> 15:34.295
I look forward to putting them
in my trophy case.

15:34.531 --> 15:38.000
You have no idea who I am, do you?

15:38.035 --> 15:39.434
DENTIST: Of course I do.

15:39.470 --> 15:42.572
You are Don Falcone's daughter.

15:43.941 --> 15:45.970
He killed my brother.

15:46.343 --> 15:48.310
(drill whirring)

15:48.345 --> 15:50.689
I'm going to enjoy this.

15:51.315 --> 15:52.914
It's true he killed your brother,

15:52.950 --> 15:55.825
but not your wife, Elaine,
or your son, Joseph.

15:55.850 --> 15:58.709
No, they're still alive,
probably having lunch

15:58.734 --> 16:01.635
in your two bedroom
on Seventh Ave right now.

16:04.828 --> 16:06.461
See?

16:06.497 --> 16:08.296
I made it a point to learn every detail

16:08.332 --> 16:09.865
of Penguin's organization.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.000
For instance, I learned that

16:12.036 --> 16:14.102
he only trusts one man
for this type of job.

16:14.138 --> 16:15.437
You.

16:15.472 --> 16:17.873
And in the event that
I am ever tortured,

16:17.908 --> 16:19.775
my people have instructions

16:20.104 --> 16:21.843
to kill your family.

16:22.174 --> 16:24.946
Interesting threat.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.817
But no one's going to know
that you were tortured

16:29.086 --> 16:31.486
because no one is going
to find your body.

16:31.522 --> 16:33.121
(laughs): Oh, 'cause you don't think

16:33.157 --> 16:35.190
I have spies
inside Penguin's organization.

16:35.225 --> 16:37.125
He's right about me, though.

16:37.161 --> 16:38.794
I have been conspiring
against him for months,

16:38.829 --> 16:41.604
turning his captains
against him one by one

16:41.635 --> 16:46.468
and today is the day that
I will finally take him down.

16:46.704 --> 16:49.944
So, if my people don't
hear from me soon,

16:50.374 --> 16:52.107
your family's dead.

16:53.944 --> 16:56.592
But if you don't believe me...

16:57.181 --> 16:58.842
drill away.

17:00.170 --> 17:04.654
Excuse me, her restraints
need tightening.

17:11.194 --> 17:12.861
(drill whirring)

17:12.896 --> 17:15.130
(screaming)

17:19.203 --> 17:21.303
Hmm, wise decision.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.272
Now untie me.

17:32.516 --> 17:33.849
(door handle clicks)

17:38.989 --> 17:40.422
(muffled screaming)

17:42.426 --> 17:44.359
Things are finally looking up.

17:46.422 --> 17:48.352
- BARBARA: Wakey-wakey.
- (gasps)

17:49.863 --> 17:51.296
Oh, hello.

17:51.332 --> 17:54.199
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Barbara Kean.

17:54.234 --> 17:55.400
This ferocious lady is

17:55.436 --> 17:56.805
Tabitha Galavan, and that kitty-cat...

17:56.860 --> 17:58.660
that's Selina Kyle.

17:58.696 --> 18:01.363
I know who you are.

18:01.398 --> 18:03.258
Penguin wants you dead for betraying him

18:03.313 --> 18:04.790
down in the Narrows.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.368
What do you want with me?

18:06.403 --> 18:09.605
Well, we heard you and Ozzie are BFFs.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.141
So you're going to try and leverage me

18:13.177 --> 18:14.843
to get Penguin not to kill you.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.678
TABITHA: We have some other demands,

18:16.805 --> 18:18.480
but essentially, yeah.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.881
That's a good plan.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.550
Except for the fact that Penguin

18:21.585 --> 18:23.051
just tried to kill me.

18:23.087 --> 18:24.987
Why would he do that?

18:25.755 --> 18:27.956
Because I am so close

18:27.992 --> 18:29.791
to taking his underworld from him.

18:29.827 --> 18:32.127
(chuckles)

18:32.162 --> 18:33.695
You're lying.

18:33.731 --> 18:35.163
Am I?

18:35.276 --> 18:38.467
I've been working Penguin for months.

18:38.588 --> 18:42.404
Manipulating him into behaving
exactly how I want him to.

18:42.439 --> 18:45.674
Every move he made today,
I orchestrated.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.478
Now you three are screwing things up.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.514
So... you want him out of your life,

18:52.619 --> 18:54.383
let me go.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.090
Maybe she's telling the truth.

19:02.728 --> 19:04.417
She's a Falcone.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.029
She learned to lie
before she could read.

19:07.245 --> 19:09.831
But, whether you're friend or foe

19:09.867 --> 19:11.433
makes no difference to me.

19:11.468 --> 19:14.202
Because Penguin
will still make the deal.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.405
Get him on the phone.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.907
(train clacking)

19:18.942 --> 19:21.209
(horn blows)

19:24.248 --> 19:25.714
You'll grow into it.

19:25.749 --> 19:28.517
(chuckles)

19:28.552 --> 19:30.085
Because of you,

19:30.228 --> 19:33.041
I was able to vanquish my enemy.

19:33.424 --> 19:36.603
And now that you've proven yourself...

19:36.927 --> 19:40.727
I see a beautiful future ahead for you.

19:41.102 --> 19:44.633
I have so much wisdom to impart.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.641
And if you pay attention...

19:49.106 --> 19:51.239
one day, all of this could be yours.

19:53.410 --> 19:54.776
What's wrong?

20:02.119 --> 20:04.586
(scribbling)

20:05.921 --> 20:07.629
_

20:10.313 --> 20:12.301
What are you talking about?

20:13.426 --> 20:15.191
You mean...

20:15.299 --> 20:17.866
you did not see Sofia kissing Gordon?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.806
(Oswald reading):
"She wanted me to tell you they...

20:29.871 --> 20:31.626
"...kissed."

20:33.673 --> 20:36.251
Why would she do that?

20:36.618 --> 20:38.767
Unless...

20:39.223 --> 20:42.958
she knew exactly how I would respond.

20:44.161 --> 20:47.097
She wanted me to confront her.

20:47.690 --> 20:49.531
Even torture her.

20:49.566 --> 20:50.966
- Boss.
- (grunts)

20:51.001 --> 20:52.100
We have a problem.

20:52.136 --> 20:54.202
The Dentist is gone.

20:54.238 --> 20:55.971
And what happened to Sofia?

20:56.006 --> 20:58.006
To be honest,
that's still a little unclear.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.608
Barbara Kean has her.

20:59.643 --> 21:02.277
What?! How do you know this?!

21:02.312 --> 21:04.646
She's on the phone.

21:04.822 --> 21:06.846
- Says she wants to make a deal.
- (exclaims)

21:07.643 --> 21:09.251
Give me that.

21:11.582 --> 21:12.765
Barbara.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.489
Hello, Oswald.

21:14.525 --> 21:16.324
<i>I see you have crawled out from</i>

21:16.360 --> 21:18.860
whatever rock you were hiding under.

21:18.896 --> 21:20.829
What are you doing with Sofia?

21:20.864 --> 21:22.531
We scooped her up this morning.

21:22.566 --> 21:24.065
And, of course, when we did,

21:24.101 --> 21:26.468
we thought she was
your best friend. Turns out

21:26.581 --> 21:28.432
<i>she's your worst enemy.</i>

21:28.605 --> 21:29.971
I want her back.

21:30.007 --> 21:31.339
Name your price.

21:31.375 --> 21:34.009
We keep the gun shop,
we don't share profits,

21:34.044 --> 21:38.079
and from this point forward, we
operate with complete autonomy.

21:39.116 --> 21:40.515
Fine.

21:40.635 --> 21:43.548
I will send Zsasz over to collect her.

21:43.688 --> 21:46.087
She had better be there when he arrives.

21:46.123 --> 21:47.355
She will be.

21:48.859 --> 21:50.058
(phone beeps)

21:59.331 --> 22:01.886
And as for you, young man,

22:02.168 --> 22:05.369
our conversation is not over.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.266
So this is what the Pyg used to look like.

22:11.321 --> 22:12.484
That's him.

22:12.533 --> 22:15.217
All right, send it out to police
stations across the country.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.577
Start in the South.

22:16.616 --> 22:18.287
- The South? Why?
- When I pressed him,

22:18.358 --> 22:19.788
he spoke in a Southern accent.

22:19.951 --> 22:22.123
Could have done that deliberately
to throw you off?

22:22.194 --> 22:25.427
No. He slipped up...
I saw it in his eyes.

22:25.462 --> 22:27.262
This is the best lead we've got.

22:27.297 --> 22:29.064
Let's see where it goes.

22:32.597 --> 22:34.202
NYGMA: I don't understand you.

22:34.323 --> 22:37.272
If Sampson's cough will
kill him, why not let him die?

22:37.307 --> 22:39.307
There's no such thing as Narrows Lung.

22:39.343 --> 22:41.273
He probably just has bronchitis.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.812
I give him some medicine, he
feels better, problem solved.

22:43.847 --> 22:45.491
Okay, what about the 30%?

22:45.546 --> 22:47.282
Once he has that,
he's just gonna want more.

22:47.317 --> 22:49.013
Maybe.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.790
(door creaking)

22:55.826 --> 22:59.060
(low, electrical buzzing)

23:04.909 --> 23:07.768
(whispers): Sampson, you son of a bitch.

23:09.142 --> 23:11.060
Now do you see who you're dealing with?

23:13.381 --> 23:15.834
I know you wanted to try this your way.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.813
No more diplomacy, Lee.

23:18.849 --> 23:21.950
Take Grundy and end this.

23:24.006 --> 23:25.569
No.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.233
I have a better idea.

23:28.659 --> 23:29.824
That was easy.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.960
Yeah. A little too easy.

23:32.462 --> 23:34.963
SOFIA: Because he couldn't wait
to get you off the phone.

23:35.103 --> 23:36.965
We need to get out of here.

23:37.711 --> 23:39.633
And then what happens?

23:39.711 --> 23:41.734
You take over from Penguin?

23:41.838 --> 23:45.807
We are not working
for anyone but ourselves.

23:46.347 --> 23:48.498
I'm not asking you to.

23:49.046 --> 23:52.319
I will give you everything
you want from Penguin.

23:52.482 --> 23:55.150
TABITHA: You're not in a position
to offer us anything.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.518
We're in charge here.

23:56.553 --> 23:58.653
SELINA: Uh, guys,
I think we should listen to her.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.088
- Why?
- Because Zsasz is

24:00.123 --> 24:02.791
standing out front
holding a rocket launcher.

24:05.062 --> 24:06.728
Ladies.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.773
(all coughing)

24:21.593 --> 24:24.312
I'm gonna break his little beak in half.

24:26.070 --> 24:29.176
- Jim!
- Sorry, Cap, I tried to stop her.

24:29.246 --> 24:30.277
I told her she had to wait.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.634
It's okay, Detective. I've got it.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.837
Sofia, what happened to you?

24:34.872 --> 24:37.206
(crying): I underestimated Oswald.

24:37.241 --> 24:38.841
He found out we were
plotting against him,

24:38.876 --> 24:40.576
and he-he just tried to kill me, Jim.

24:40.611 --> 24:42.077
He can't hurt you here.

24:42.112 --> 24:44.646
If he finds out I'm alive,
he will come after me,

24:44.682 --> 24:47.082
and he won't stop until I'm dead.

24:47.208 --> 24:48.674
You are the captain of the GCPD.

24:48.709 --> 24:50.462
Your men would follow you anywhere.

24:50.506 --> 24:52.740
Please, please, use the position

24:52.798 --> 24:54.673
I gave you and end this.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.682
What are you proposing I do?

24:56.717 --> 24:59.518
You have an army...
just take the fight to Penguin.

25:01.975 --> 25:03.756
So this was your plan.

25:03.983 --> 25:05.825
To start a war.

25:07.094 --> 25:09.195
You knew you didn't have the numbers

25:09.230 --> 25:11.749
to fight Penguin on your own,
so you made me captain,

25:11.804 --> 25:14.116
knowing it would come to this,
and I'd take him out for you.

25:14.155 --> 25:16.969
Your job is to stop criminals,
Jim... here you go.

25:17.004 --> 25:19.077
It is not that simple, and you know it.

25:19.709 --> 25:23.387
We could bring law and order
back to Gotham.

25:23.895 --> 25:26.145
This is exactly what you asked
for when you came down South,

25:26.180 --> 25:28.347
and it is yours for the taking.

25:28.382 --> 25:30.549
You know what has to be done, Jim.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.039
Crush Penguin.

25:36.123 --> 25:39.058
(siren wailing in distance)

25:39.093 --> 25:40.993
(distant horn honking)

25:41.822 --> 25:44.267
I trusted you, Martin...

25:44.532 --> 25:46.532
and you betrayed me.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.467
_

25:56.146 --> 25:59.245
I think it's time for you
to go back to the orphanage.

26:00.414 --> 26:01.747
- Boss?
- Hold on!

26:03.317 --> 26:06.697
Let the little spy step out of the room.

26:16.719 --> 26:18.130
So?

26:18.578 --> 26:21.867
The place went up
like a great ball of fire.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.612
Good. Alert the capos.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.596
We are going to unleash
a crime wave on this city

26:27.643 --> 26:29.610
like it has never seen.

26:29.972 --> 26:31.204
That will teach Jim Gordon

26:31.279 --> 26:33.240
to align himself with Sofia Falcone.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.314
GORDON: I wouldn't make
that call if I were you.

26:36.309 --> 26:38.309
I just spoke with Sofia.

26:39.020 --> 26:42.388
She's alive, and she told me
you tried to kill her.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.323
Hearsay, Jim.

26:44.463 --> 26:46.792
Been here all day. I have witnesses.

26:46.827 --> 26:48.533
I don't care.

26:49.228 --> 26:51.463
I'm not here to arrest you.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.218
I came to make a deal.

26:54.368 --> 26:57.336
I think we've both put up
with Sofia long enough.

26:59.507 --> 27:02.041
Victor, would you give us a moment?

27:05.613 --> 27:08.080
Okay, Jim, you have my attention.

27:09.019 --> 27:10.916
Since the moment she set foot in Gotham,

27:10.952 --> 27:14.320
Sofia has put us on a path to war.

27:14.355 --> 27:16.322
She's willing to let this
city burn to the ground

27:16.357 --> 27:17.756
to prove herself to her father.

27:17.792 --> 27:19.525
I can't allow that.

27:20.561 --> 27:22.528
So what do you want from me?

27:22.857 --> 27:24.826
I'm putting her on a train home tonight.

27:24.899 --> 27:27.499
But I need assurances from you
you won't get involved.

27:27.535 --> 27:29.501
(laughs) Not good enough!

27:29.537 --> 27:32.224
She needs to suffer
for what she has done.

27:32.279 --> 27:33.575
That is not gonna happen.

27:33.630 --> 27:34.873
And how do you think your girlfriend's

27:34.909 --> 27:36.375
gonna react when she realizes

27:36.410 --> 27:37.977
you betrayed her?

27:38.012 --> 27:40.212
You think she's just
gonna run away quietly?

27:40.247 --> 27:42.281
If she sets foot in Gotham again,

27:42.316 --> 27:44.917
I'll put her behind bars.

27:46.387 --> 27:48.420
And if I say no?

27:48.662 --> 27:50.823
Then I'll have no choice

27:51.108 --> 27:54.560
but to use the full force of the GCPD

27:54.595 --> 27:56.829
to tear you apart, piece...

27:56.864 --> 27:59.052
by... piece.

27:59.935 --> 28:01.533
That does not sound very pleasant.

28:01.569 --> 28:03.256
It won't be.

28:04.939 --> 28:07.838
I guess I can put aside
my personal feelings

28:07.916 --> 28:09.642
for the good of this city.

28:09.677 --> 28:12.344
But I do have one question for you, Jim.

28:12.380 --> 28:14.580
Once Sofia is gone...

28:14.907 --> 28:16.849
where does that leave us?

28:17.470 --> 28:19.418
No more licenses.

28:19.453 --> 28:21.353
If you or any other
criminal in this city

28:21.389 --> 28:23.322
break the law, my men will enforce it.

28:24.165 --> 28:26.458
But at least you won't have
to worry about Sofia again.

28:28.009 --> 28:29.242
So...

28:29.347 --> 28:31.481
do we have a deal?

28:34.001 --> 28:37.202
After all we have been through
together, Jim, it is nice

28:37.238 --> 28:39.304
that we can resolve this matter
with diplomacy.

28:44.412 --> 28:46.478
♪ ♪

28:48.074 --> 28:50.473
(Sampson belches)

28:50.586 --> 28:52.253
Ah, Doc.

28:52.453 --> 28:54.920
I heard about what happened
to your clinic.

28:54.955 --> 28:56.522
What a shame.

28:56.557 --> 29:01.060
I was looking forward to you
curing my, uh, Narrows Lung.

29:01.095 --> 29:03.028
(laughing)

29:04.359 --> 29:07.406
I want you cleared out of the Narrows
by the end of the day.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.068
What did you say to me?

29:09.103 --> 29:11.070
I think she was pretty clear.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.273
Then allow me to be clear.

29:15.059 --> 29:17.293
This is my turf,
and I'm not going anywhere.

29:17.348 --> 29:19.211
And you two have dug your own graves.

29:19.246 --> 29:22.284
Oh, well, then I guess
you don't want this?

29:22.616 --> 29:24.283
What's that?

29:24.573 --> 29:26.685
The antidote to the poison
I had slipped in your drink

29:26.721 --> 29:27.986
about 30 minutes ago.

29:30.070 --> 29:31.503
(chuckles): Ironic, isn't it?

29:31.625 --> 29:33.225
It's the only thing from the clinic

29:33.260 --> 29:34.593
that wasn't destroyed.

29:34.628 --> 29:36.462
Some vials of medicine I had mixed

29:36.497 --> 29:38.194
into a deadly combination.

29:38.259 --> 29:40.759
Should be kicking in,
uh, right about now.

29:40.835 --> 29:42.434
You're bluffing.

29:42.470 --> 29:44.600
I feel absolutely f... (chokes)

29:44.772 --> 29:46.105
I'm sorry, what was that?

29:46.248 --> 29:48.240
(gasping): Get 'em!

29:48.275 --> 29:50.576
THOMPKINS: Come any closer
and I'll destroy this.

29:52.446 --> 29:55.047
(coughing)

29:56.684 --> 29:58.717
(choking)

30:00.454 --> 30:02.154
Like I said...

30:02.761 --> 30:04.433
you leave by the end of the day,

30:04.636 --> 30:06.492
and you'll live.

30:07.528 --> 30:09.027
Deal?

30:10.231 --> 30:12.197
(quietly): Okay.

30:12.766 --> 30:14.967
Oh. Catch.

30:15.002 --> 30:15.934
(gasps)

30:15.970 --> 30:17.202
(Sampson hacking)

30:20.257 --> 30:22.882
I know you're disappointed, but
I am doing this to protect you.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.893
Disappointment doesn't
quite cover it, Jim.

30:24.983 --> 30:26.981
If you stay in Gotham,
Penguin will kill you.

30:27.005 --> 30:28.122
Don't put this on Penguin.

30:28.177 --> 30:30.978
If you have something to say,
I think you should say it.

30:41.791 --> 30:44.158
We're the same, Jim.

30:44.604 --> 30:47.394
I saw it the first moment we met.

30:47.430 --> 30:49.596
We both want power.

30:49.632 --> 30:52.182
You want to deny it, but it's true.

30:52.416 --> 30:55.462
And it is just easier to send me away.

30:58.107 --> 30:59.506
(handcuffs clack)

31:00.776 --> 31:03.343
Detective Harper, please
take Ms. Falcone

31:03.379 --> 31:05.946
to the train station and
escort her back home.

31:05.981 --> 31:07.948
(whispers): Please don't do this.

31:07.983 --> 31:09.416
Better get going.

31:09.452 --> 31:10.784
You'll miss your train.

31:19.328 --> 31:21.795
(thunder crashing)

31:23.199 --> 31:25.365
ZSASZ: Gordon put her on the train.

31:25.401 --> 31:27.835
Talk about a turn of events.

31:27.870 --> 31:30.804
Did not see that coming.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.539
What about the kid?

31:32.575 --> 31:35.476
You want me to take him
back to the orphanage?

31:38.914 --> 31:40.981
That won't be necessary.

31:43.719 --> 31:46.653
Martin, I have been thinking.

31:46.689 --> 31:48.388
I was angry.

31:48.424 --> 31:50.657
I did not mean what I...

31:51.727 --> 31:53.160
Martin?

32:04.065 --> 32:05.483
_

32:07.793 --> 32:09.960
Martin.

32:17.817 --> 32:19.953
Oh, he's cute.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.380
He doesn't talk.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.460
The kid gives me the creeps.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.631
(sighs) Let's get this over with.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.521
(train whistle blows)

32:47.708 --> 32:49.237
Nervous about something?

32:50.619 --> 32:52.286
Well, we have a long way to go.

32:52.321 --> 32:54.321
So get comfy.

33:00.972 --> 33:02.671
ZSASZ: Tickets, please.

33:02.754 --> 33:04.119
(gasps) What...?

33:09.171 --> 33:10.904
Hello, Victor.

33:10.940 --> 33:13.674
- Where's the boy?
- Alive, for now.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.577
If Oswald wants to keep it that way,

33:16.612 --> 33:19.580
he will meet me under the
Crown Point Bridge in one hour.

33:19.615 --> 33:21.715
MAN (over P.A.): <i>Next stop, Stevenstown.</i>

33:21.750 --> 33:23.176
That's my stop.

33:23.285 --> 33:25.332
Do you mind?

33:25.788 --> 33:27.988
Not at all.

33:28.023 --> 33:29.590
(gunshot)

33:29.625 --> 33:31.124
Thank you.

33:36.165 --> 33:38.432
(ship horn blows)

33:56.030 --> 33:58.518
Glad you could make it, Oswald.

33:59.671 --> 34:03.001
Everything will be all right,
Martin, I promise.

34:03.955 --> 34:06.033
Well, that depends on you.

34:06.161 --> 34:08.228
Turn over control
of the underworld to me,

34:08.263 --> 34:11.965
and I'll let little Martin
here... keep his head.

34:14.036 --> 34:17.471
The name Falcone used to
mean something in this town.

34:17.505 --> 34:21.274
Wait until your father hears of this...

34:21.310 --> 34:23.275
threatening the life of a child!

34:23.359 --> 34:25.797
- He will be disgusted!
- Wrong.

34:26.514 --> 34:29.049
My father will be proud.

34:31.754 --> 34:35.172
Must be hard to live your whole life

34:35.242 --> 34:37.491
trying to get Daddy's approval.

34:37.525 --> 34:39.132
I, myself, can't relate,

34:39.195 --> 34:42.763
seeing as my parents loved me
without condition.

34:45.027 --> 34:48.328
Say one more word and I will kill him,

34:48.370 --> 34:50.370
and then I will execute you.

34:50.406 --> 34:52.239
I am choosing compassion,

34:52.274 --> 34:55.286
but I am willing to change my position.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.698
Don't hurt the boy.

35:02.886 --> 35:04.352
He's innocent.

35:10.293 --> 35:11.681
I submit.

35:13.614 --> 35:14.947
(whispers): Go ahead.

35:22.439 --> 35:25.156
Martin, I want you to know...

35:25.642 --> 35:27.442
I'm sorry for what I said.

35:28.478 --> 35:30.892
I do care about you.

35:31.614 --> 35:33.548
You know that's true, don't you?

35:37.454 --> 35:39.327
Good.

35:40.924 --> 35:44.616
Now, go wait in the car.

36:06.437 --> 36:08.746
You were wise to use the boy.

36:09.634 --> 36:12.449
As you know, my heart

36:12.558 --> 36:15.226
is my greatest weakness,

36:15.478 --> 36:17.378
but...

36:17.861 --> 36:20.762
I will not allow him to be used

36:20.797 --> 36:24.601
as a pawn in your game anymore.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.130
You wanted a war,

36:43.296 --> 36:45.096
you've got one!

36:45.130 --> 36:46.220
(rapid gunfire)

36:54.196 --> 36:56.014
(indistinct conversations)

36:56.116 --> 36:57.348
(glass breaking)

36:57.450 --> 36:58.883
Ed.

36:58.985 --> 37:01.344
Why so blue? We had a great day.

37:01.430 --> 37:03.296
You had a great day.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.096
I did nothing to help.

37:05.253 --> 37:06.586
That's not true.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.162
I couldn't have done it without you.

37:08.248 --> 37:11.216
I'm not meant to be a sidekick, Lee.

37:15.122 --> 37:17.989
Sampson was right, I'm a has-been.

37:20.695 --> 37:22.952
No, you're not.

37:23.330 --> 37:25.827
Look I asked you to
trust me with something today

37:25.887 --> 37:26.986
and you did.

37:27.038 --> 37:29.432
So I'm gonna trust you with something.

37:30.979 --> 37:33.270
I haven't been looking
for a cure for your brain, Ed,

37:33.666 --> 37:35.896
because there's nothing wrong with you.

37:36.361 --> 37:37.766
- But you...
- Sure.

37:37.978 --> 37:40.407
At first there was
an effect from the ice,

37:40.614 --> 37:42.814
but I ran all the tests; it checks out.

37:43.602 --> 37:45.317
There's nothing wrong
with you, physically.

37:45.419 --> 37:47.485
Your condition is psychological.

37:48.735 --> 37:50.360
Think about it.

37:50.704 --> 37:52.924
You knew every move
that Sampson was gonna make

37:53.026 --> 37:54.259
before he made it.

37:56.991 --> 37:58.824
You lied to me.

37:59.499 --> 38:00.932
Why?

38:01.409 --> 38:03.309
Because I was afraid that
if I told you the truth,

38:03.360 --> 38:05.338
you would go back to being
who you were before,

38:05.472 --> 38:07.205
The Riddler.

38:07.307 --> 38:09.307
And I like who you've become.

38:10.844 --> 38:12.177
Who's that?

38:14.281 --> 38:16.281
Ed Nygma.

38:17.302 --> 38:19.684
The Ed that you were before.

38:20.576 --> 38:22.382
My friend.

38:28.388 --> 38:30.522
Well, that backfired.

38:30.624 --> 38:32.833
Penguin's gonna be coming for us.
What are we gonna do?

38:32.895 --> 38:34.426
We hit him before he hits us.

38:35.162 --> 38:37.195
Lady, you lost.

38:37.297 --> 38:39.297
Penguin just blew up that kid.

38:39.399 --> 38:40.932
I admit I didn't see that coming.

38:41.034 --> 38:42.667
But Oswald still has to align his capos

38:42.769 --> 38:43.868
before he moves on us.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.603
We use that window of time
to make our play.

38:46.214 --> 38:49.808
You didn't get told "no"
a lot as a kid, did you?

38:49.910 --> 38:51.609
You took your shot and you missed.

38:51.712 --> 38:54.045
- We're going it alone from here.
- You leave now,

38:54.147 --> 38:57.315
and you will never have
a piece of this city.

38:59.786 --> 39:01.886
Now, that sounded like a threat.

39:02.327 --> 39:06.391
Your club is destroyed.
You have nowhere else to turn.

39:06.493 --> 39:07.792
You need me.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.496
Penguin may have won the battle,

39:11.931 --> 39:13.965
but tomorrow we win the war.

39:16.213 --> 39:17.791
ZSASZ: Boss.

39:25.979 --> 39:27.779
My boy.

39:28.753 --> 39:31.241
You did a splendid job of dying.

39:32.842 --> 39:34.248
_

39:40.200 --> 39:43.294
Victor will take you to a safe location.

39:43.825 --> 39:46.395
You can never return to Gotham.

39:47.513 --> 39:49.834
This is good-bye, my friend.

39:51.872 --> 39:53.872
(scribbling)

39:56.602 --> 39:59.313
_

40:01.815 --> 40:03.348
There, there.

40:04.323 --> 40:06.573
This is what I have to do
to protect you.

40:06.761 --> 40:09.425
One day, when you are older,
you will understand.

40:20.634 --> 40:23.134
Sofia's on her heels, boss.

40:23.236 --> 40:24.769
Let's finish her off.

40:24.871 --> 40:26.704
Have someone else take the kid.

40:26.807 --> 40:28.039
No.

40:28.141 --> 40:29.808
I want my top man on this.

40:30.149 --> 40:31.776
Besides,

40:31.878 --> 40:35.580
I have something much better
planned for Sofia Falcone.

40:39.409 --> 40:41.151
You were right about the Pyg.

40:41.301 --> 40:43.321
A precinct down South
recognized the picture

40:43.423 --> 40:45.056
you had me send out.

40:45.158 --> 40:47.016
His real name is Lazlo Valentine.

40:47.109 --> 40:48.226
What do we know about him?

40:48.305 --> 40:49.661
He was being held for a string

40:49.763 --> 40:51.462
of murders down there ten years ago.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.331
But here's the thing:
his previous victims

40:53.433 --> 40:54.933
weren't police officers,

40:55.035 --> 40:57.302
and there was no Pyg persona.

40:57.404 --> 40:59.971
Serial killers don't usually
change their M.O.

41:00.073 --> 41:01.272
This guy did.

41:01.802 --> 41:04.342
You said he was being held.

41:04.732 --> 41:06.937
Did they say why their case fell apart?

41:06.977 --> 41:09.079
It didn't. He escaped.

41:10.450 --> 41:11.916
Call Arkham.

41:12.018 --> 41:14.774
Have them put a guard on his cell.
I'm on my way.

41:23.196 --> 41:24.362
(metal clanks)

41:27.304 --> 41:29.285
Pyg?

41:33.373 --> 41:34.539
(metal clanks)

41:36.810 --> 41:38.810
(metal clanks)

41:46.049 --> 41:47.649
Pyg?

41:54.261 --> 41:55.226
(guard grunts)

41:55.328 --> 41:56.895
(gagging)

42:00.967 --> 42:03.501
(sighs)

42:03.603 --> 42:05.670
(water turns off)

42:12.312 --> 42:13.745
(gasps)

42:13.847 --> 42:15.146
Hello, Ed.

42:15.248 --> 42:16.247
No.

42:17.148 --> 42:18.349
No!

42:18.451 --> 42:20.451
(exhales, inhales)

42:21.858 --> 42:23.391
Miss me?

42:23.423 --> 42:25.990
(laughs)

42:26.092 --> 42:28.259
(thunder rumbles)

42:30.296 --> 42:32.218
GORDON: Open it, let's go.

42:34.768 --> 42:37.250
GUARD: Sound the alarm!

42:37.595 --> 42:38.661
(alarm ringing)

42:40.246 --> 42:44.551
