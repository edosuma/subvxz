04:56.496 --> 04:57.554
No!

05:31.197 --> 05:33.461
There she is. There she is.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.299
There she is.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.963
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

14:35.107 --> 14:39.237
<i>I've traveled over half our state</i>
<i>to be here tonight.</i>

14:39.345 --> 14:41.870
<i>I couldn't get away sooner</i>
<i>because my new well was coming in</i>

14:41.981 --> 14:44.882
<i>at Coyote Hills</i>
<i>and I had to see about it.</i>

14:44.984 --> 14:47.976
<i>That well is now flowing</i>
<i>at 2,000 barrels</i>

14:48.120 --> 14:51.283
<i>and it's paying me an income</i>
<i>of $5,000 a week.</i>

14:51.957 --> 14:55.256
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

14:55.394 --> 14:59.797
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.297
Now, you have a great chance here,

15:05.437 --> 15:08.304
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.806
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15:10.943 --> 15:14.140
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.474
The rest will be speculators,

15:15.581 --> 15:18.106
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

15:18.217 --> 15:21.812
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.856
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

15:24.990 --> 15:27.424
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.494
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

15:29.628 --> 15:32.426
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

15:32.531 --> 15:33.589
who'll rush the job through

15:33.699 --> 15:35.792
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.459
This is the way that this works.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.835
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.107
Please!

15:45.344 --> 15:47.278
I do my own drilling.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.815
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.648
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.848
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.117
I don't botch the cementing off

16:00.226 --> 16:03.787
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.920
I'm a family man.

16:06.031 --> 16:10.661
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

16:11.670 --> 16:16.471
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

16:18.444 --> 16:21.504
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

16:21.647 --> 16:24.810
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.384
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.613
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.815
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.724
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

16:36.862 --> 16:40.696
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

16:40.833 --> 16:43.768
and to put up the cash to back my word.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.427
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

16:45.537 --> 16:48.836
no matter what the others
promise to do,

16:48.974 --> 16:52.375
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.615
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

16:57.483 --> 16:58.450
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.644
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.744
- Prescott, do you trust this man?
- Let's discuss what he has to say.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.313
- There's logic to what he's saying.
- How does he know? My lot is there!

17:08.160 --> 17:11.288
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

17:11.396 --> 17:14.525
- We gain nothing by losing our heads!
- Look at that well out there!

17:14.633 --> 17:16.156
Nobody's losing their heads.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.695
You have no business being here!

17:20.673 --> 17:23.141
Sit that woman down, sir!

17:24.810 --> 17:26.175
You can sit down.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.780
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.873
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

17:31.984 --> 17:35.078
- I don't need the lease. Thank you.
- But we need you.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.417
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.184
No, no, there's no confusion.

17:39.325 --> 17:42.988
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.436
<i>Mr. Bankside,</i>
<i>I'm not going to waste your time.</i>

17:56.542 --> 17:59.010
<i>I'd certainly appreciate it</i>
<i>if you didn't waste mine.</i>

17:59.111 --> 18:03.844
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

18:03.949 --> 18:07.350
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

18:07.519 --> 18:10.044
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.555
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

18:12.691 --> 18:15.683
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

18:15.794 --> 18:20.390
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.830
I need you to know what you want to do.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.961
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

18:26.071 --> 18:28.335
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

18:28.440 --> 18:32.274
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.936
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

18:34.046 --> 18:38.483
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.815
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.697
What age are your children, ma'am?

18:52.831 --> 18:54.526
Ten and twelve.

18:55.667 --> 18:59.535
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

19:01.673 --> 19:04.506
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.909
So it's just me and my son now.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.652
It's coming in, boss!

19:17.089 --> 19:18.386
Hear it?

19:44.683 --> 19:46.378
Mr. Plainview?

19:46.485 --> 19:47.713
Yes?

19:49.955 --> 19:52.048
Are you Daniel Plainview?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.085
Yes.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.730
What can I do for you?

20:00.566 --> 20:02.363
You look for oil.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.069
That's right.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.230
What do you pay for a place that has it?

20:08.373 --> 20:11.365
- Well, that depends.
- What does it depend on?

20:13.412 --> 20:15.243
On a lot of things.

20:16.181 --> 20:21.175
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

20:21.286 --> 20:24.050
what do you think that would be worth?

20:25.057 --> 20:29.289
I think that you should let me know
what you know

20:29.394 --> 20:32.522
and then we'll try
and work something out.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.693
- Can I sit down?
- Please.

20:47.846 --> 20:50.144
What church do you belong to?

20:55.854 --> 20:57.151
I...

20:59.324 --> 21:02.816
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

21:02.961 --> 21:06.954
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

21:07.065 --> 21:10.933
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.065
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

21:16.175 --> 21:18.575
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

21:18.677 --> 21:20.235
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

21:20.345 --> 21:21.403
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

21:21.513 --> 21:23.276
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.112
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

21:28.687 --> 21:30.552
Is it in California?

21:31.490 --> 21:34.618
- Maybe.
- How much land did they buy?

21:34.760 --> 21:38.161
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.937
Why did you come to me?

21:49.074 --> 21:53.374
- You just brought this well in.
- That's right.

21:53.478 --> 21:57.778
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

21:57.916 --> 22:00.350
and I'll tell you where it is.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.716
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

22:02.821 --> 22:07.451
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.527
Six hundred dollars.

22:12.364 --> 22:15.231
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.029
What do you grow?

22:17.135 --> 22:20.866
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.441
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

22:23.575 --> 22:24.769
What makes you think it's up?

22:24.910 --> 22:27.970
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

22:28.113 --> 22:31.139
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.520
Is that your son?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.255
Yes.

22:42.594 --> 22:43.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.898
- Who are you?
- I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.003
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.731
What do you do?

22:54.740 --> 22:56.833
I work with Mr. Plainview.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.271
Here's $500, son.

22:59.411 --> 23:03.245
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

23:07.219 --> 23:11.087
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

23:13.258 --> 23:17.695
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

23:17.796 --> 23:20.788
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.129
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.204
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

23:26.338 --> 23:30.240
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

23:30.375 --> 23:34.072
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

23:34.212 --> 23:38.342
- Where's Standard buying up?
- Here and here.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.953
- Your family name is Sunday, yes?
- That's right.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.522
How many's in your family?

23:44.656 --> 23:47.853
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

23:47.993 --> 23:50.655
- How many sisters do you have?
- Two.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.094
- What's your name?
- Paul.

23:53.198 --> 23:56.429
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

23:56.535 --> 23:57.968
I don't know.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.664
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

24:00.806 --> 24:03.274
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.808
What do you grow?

24:04.910 --> 24:10.075
It's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.673
- Is there water?
- It's salty.

24:12.818 --> 24:16.185
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

24:18.056 --> 24:21.457
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

24:26.098 --> 24:29.295
- I want to go now, so...
- You can stay tonight.

24:29.434 --> 24:33.495
- No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
- Listen, Paul.

24:35.374 --> 24:40.141
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

24:40.278 --> 24:42.872
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.211
Is that all right with you?

24:45.317 --> 24:47.547
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

24:48.286 --> 24:52.416
- Nice luck to you. God bless.
- And to you, young man.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.848
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.129
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.939
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

26:53.812 --> 26:56.576
- Are you hunting?
- Hunting for quail.

26:56.681 --> 26:59.548
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.482
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.316
- Thank you. Do you have water?
- Yes.

27:05.323 --> 27:07.314
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.290
- Is that right?
- Yes.

27:10.161 --> 27:13.824
- Your family?
- Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.903
- We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
- That would be fine.

27:20.939 --> 27:21.906
Now,

27:23.808 --> 27:27.869
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.241
That's fine.

27:29.347 --> 27:31.542
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.083
No! H.W.

27:34.986 --> 27:38.444
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

27:38.590 --> 27:42.651
- That would be fine. Thank you.
- Mary! Bring them some milk.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.227
My family will help you set up your tent.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.559
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.326
We have to do the camping.

27:48.466 --> 27:49.831
Hurry up!

27:52.804 --> 27:56.797
- Do you have bread?
- We have potatoes.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.569
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.144
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

28:00.278 --> 28:02.576
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.911
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.950
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

28:07.085 --> 28:09.110
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.279
- Yes.
- And we'll be out of your way.

28:11.389 --> 28:14.119
- We're just hunting for quail.
- Yes.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.255
- I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
- No, no, no.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.161
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

28:21.299 --> 28:24.097
We don't have room to raise the grain.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.898
Thank you, young lady.

28:55.133 --> 28:56.760
My name is Eli.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.071
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.471
Welcome.

29:06.177 --> 29:07.872
- H.W.
- Eli.

29:13.184 --> 29:16.278
- You're hunting quail?
- That's right.

29:20.558 --> 29:25.052
- We will bring dinner.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

30:47.145 --> 30:48.339
Dad!

30:49.047 --> 30:50.776
Dad, look at my shoe.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.903
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.731
<i>So...</i>

31:46.337 --> 31:47.531
<i>So?</i>

31:48.406 --> 31:49.771
<i>So, so.</i>

31:50.575 --> 31:53.874
<i>If there's anything here,</i>
<i>we take it to the sea.</i>

31:55.013 --> 31:58.744
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

31:58.850 --> 32:00.374
it's about 100 miles,

32:00.485 --> 32:04.387
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.892
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

32:07.992 --> 32:09.391
You see?

32:12.230 --> 32:13.254
Yeah.

32:13.398 --> 32:16.000
- You see that?
- Yeah.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.365
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.301
What we should be making.
Not just...

32:21.439 --> 32:23.805
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.069
Otherwise, it's just mud.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.875
How much are we going to pay them?

32:33.751 --> 32:35.241
Who's that?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.753
The Sunday family.

32:40.325 --> 32:43.192
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

32:45.763 --> 32:48.027
I'll give them quail prices.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.398
If we could take a few minutes,

32:55.506 --> 32:58.634
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

32:58.776 --> 33:02.109
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

33:14.325 --> 33:17.089
I believe in plain speaking, so...

33:17.228 --> 33:20.891
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.826
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

33:24.936 --> 33:28.167
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.975
So,

33:33.578 --> 33:37.537
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

33:38.683 --> 33:41.243
- To buy this place?
- That's right.

33:46.257 --> 33:48.054
Take a moment.

33:51.930 --> 33:55.661
- I'm sorry. I don't know.
- Six dollars an acre.

33:55.767 --> 33:59.203
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

33:59.337 --> 34:03.034
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

34:03.174 --> 34:05.699
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

34:05.843 --> 34:08.402
- That's $3,700.
- No.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.645
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.239
Yes, I believe He has.

34:13.384 --> 34:17.445
- My offer to you is $3,700.
- What is it that brought you here, sir?

34:18.656 --> 34:20.317
The Good Lord's guidance.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.755
- Now, of course, within that...
- What about our oil?

34:21.859 --> 34:23.520
...we're going to develop a lease.

34:24.829 --> 34:28.321
- What's that?
- What about our oil?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.167
What about it?

34:31.268 --> 34:33.464
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.005
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

34:36.107 --> 34:38.041
- Do you think there's oil here?
- I know there is.

34:38.176 --> 34:40.201
It's very expensive to drill.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.505
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

34:42.612 --> 34:44.672
- How much is it?
- Costly.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.842
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.614
I believe that's called seepage.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.245
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

34:52.389 --> 34:54.551
- What would you give us for it?
- I don't know.

34:54.659 --> 34:57.594
- Something you don't know.
- That's right.

35:00.898 --> 35:02.866
What would you like, Eli?

35:04.602 --> 35:06.900
Ten thousand dollars.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.574
For what?

35:12.543 --> 35:14.238
For my church.

35:24.188 --> 35:25.678
That's good.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.490
That's a good one.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.130
Well...

35:34.399 --> 35:37.994
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

35:38.102 --> 35:39.797
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

35:39.904 --> 35:40.871
Ten thousand.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.463
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

35:43.574 --> 35:46.668
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

35:46.811 --> 35:50.679
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

35:50.815 --> 35:55.445
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.350
For the bonus only.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.957
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

36:03.061 --> 36:07.623
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

36:07.732 --> 36:09.632
Yes. What Eli says.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.930
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

36:13.037 --> 36:14.937
Let's give it a try.

36:16.307 --> 36:19.140
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.082
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.487
- Real estate?
- Yes.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.615
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

36:35.760 --> 36:40.254
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

36:40.398 --> 36:44.425
And, well, where's the map?

36:45.002 --> 36:47.436
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

36:47.572 --> 36:51.235
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

36:51.342 --> 36:55.403
Bandy, 600.

36:55.546 --> 37:02.008
- What about this?
- A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.713
- What's it held at?
- Six dollars an acre.

37:07.458 --> 37:08.755
Six.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.520
What about this?

37:10.628 --> 37:14.223
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

37:16.134 --> 37:18.830
Can everything around here be got?

37:19.604 --> 37:21.071
Sure.

37:45.396 --> 37:48.854
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

37:49.567 --> 37:51.159
That's right.

37:53.504 --> 37:57.497
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.309
Good enough.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.707
Thank you, porter.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.944
- H.W., how are you?
- Fine, and you?

38:08.052 --> 38:09.952
- Pretty good. Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

38:10.054 --> 38:11.453
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

38:11.556 --> 38:13.524
- Hello, Plainview.
- Hello, Gene.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.149
- Good to see you.
- Charlie.

38:16.294 --> 38:20.822
- On your way somewhere else?
- Passing through. Looking around.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.456
- Funny to see you.
- Funny, isn't it?

38:23.601 --> 38:26.331
You boys are a regular family business.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.131
You boys are a little late.

38:28.272 --> 38:32.299
- What did you find?
- I found some interesting prospects.

38:32.443 --> 38:33.671
Did you hear Standard bought up?

38:33.811 --> 38:36.405
- Mostly in the north, so far.
- That's what I hear.

38:36.514 --> 38:39.950
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

38:40.084 --> 38:45.317
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

38:45.456 --> 38:48.983
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

38:49.126 --> 38:52.186
- Telling me how handsome my son is?
- Well, that I am.

38:52.296 --> 38:55.459
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.068
- Take care.
- Like I said, go east.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.261
H.W.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.966
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

39:03.107 --> 39:07.373
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.247
How's that?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.366
What are those men doing?

39:38.709 --> 39:41.234
They're just guys
that are working for us.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.677
They're just looking around.

39:45.883 --> 39:48.113
How much money can we make?

39:52.156 --> 39:54.522
I don't know. It depends.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.822
One thousand dollars?

40:08.673 --> 40:12.439
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

40:19.016 --> 40:21.450
Mary, she's the smaller one?

40:24.121 --> 40:25.645
Yes, she is.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.962
- Everyone here?
- Very successful.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.764
But?

40:43.908 --> 40:47.275
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.038
- Who?
- William Bandy.

40:49.146 --> 40:51.205
...eight. Who's he?

40:51.315 --> 40:52.714
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

40:52.817 --> 40:55.945
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.247
Is he here?

40:57.388 --> 41:00.414
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.253
He's boosting his price.

41:02.393 --> 41:06.193
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.562
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.574
Ladies and gentlemen?

41:19.577 --> 41:21.602
Ladies and gentlemen.

41:21.746 --> 41:25.113
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

41:25.249 --> 41:28.810
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

41:31.889 --> 41:33.379
<i>Now, I daresay some of you</i>
<i>might have heard</i>

41:33.524 --> 41:37.358
<i>some of the more extravagant rumors</i>
<i>about what my plans are,</i>

41:37.461 --> 41:40.225
<i>so I just thought</i>
<i>you'd like to hear it from me.</i>

41:40.364 --> 41:43.231
<i>This is the face. It's no great mystery.</i>

41:46.103 --> 41:50.062
<i>I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

41:50.941 --> 41:54.342
<i>I have numerous concerns</i>
<i>spread across this state.</i>

41:54.445 --> 41:57.846
<i>I have many wells flowing</i>
<i>at many thousand barrels per day,</i>

41:57.948 --> 42:00.917
<i>so I like to think of myself as an oilman.</i>

42:01.919 --> 42:03.716
<i>As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive</i>

42:03.821 --> 42:06.722
<i>just good old-fashioned plain speaking.</i>

42:08.359 --> 42:11.886
<i>Now, this work that we do</i>
<i>is very much a family enterprise.</i>

42:12.029 --> 42:14.691
<i>I work side by side</i>
<i>with my wonderful son, H. W.</i>

42:14.799 --> 42:18.030
<i>I think one or two of you</i>
<i>might have met him already.</i>

42:18.135 --> 42:21.901
<i>And I encourage my men</i>
<i>to bring their families, as well.</i>

42:22.039 --> 42:25.998
<i>Of course, it makes for an ever</i>
<i>so much more rewarding life for them.</i>

42:26.110 --> 42:30.069
<i>Family means children,</i>
<i>and children means education.</i>

42:30.214 --> 42:33.877
<i>So, wherever we set up camp,</i>
<i>education is a necessity,</i>

42:34.018 --> 42:36.213
<i>and we're just so happy</i>
<i>to take care of that.</i>

42:36.353 --> 42:38.719
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

42:38.856 --> 42:41.051
These children are the future
that we strive for,

42:41.192 --> 42:44.286
and so they should have
the very best of things.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.386
Now, something else,

42:46.530 --> 42:50.364
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

42:50.501 --> 42:52.469
Let's talk about bread.

42:53.170 --> 42:56.503
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

42:56.640 --> 43:00.838
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

43:00.978 --> 43:04.436
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

43:05.249 --> 43:08.810
<i>We're going to dig water wells here,</i>
<i>and water wells means irrigation.</i>

43:08.953 --> 43:11.319
<i>Irrigation means cultivation.</i>

43:11.455 --> 43:15.323
<i>We're going to raise crops here where</i>
<i>before it just simply wasn't possible.</i>

43:15.459 --> 43:17.859
<i>You're going to have more grain</i>
<i>than you'll know what to do with,</i>

43:17.995 --> 43:20.930
<i>and bread will be coming right</i>
<i>out of your ears, ma'am.</i>

43:21.031 --> 43:26.333
<i>New roads, agriculture,</i>
<i>employment, education.</i>

43:26.470 --> 43:28.438
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

43:28.539 --> 43:30.507
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

43:30.641 --> 43:32.802
that if we do find oil here,

43:32.943 --> 43:36.344
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

43:36.480 --> 43:40.974
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

43:43.220 --> 43:46.246
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

43:46.357 --> 43:48.882
Will the new road lead to the church?

43:48.993 --> 43:53.430
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

43:54.098 --> 43:56.396
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

43:56.500 --> 43:57.762
You just come visit with me.

43:57.868 --> 43:59.893
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

44:38.442 --> 44:43.402
<i>What a privilege to carry</i>

44:43.547 --> 44:47.415
<i>everything to God in prayer!</i>

44:48.385 --> 44:51.946
<i>What a privilege to carry...</i>

45:09.306 --> 45:11.171
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

45:11.275 --> 45:13.505
The new road will lead you there.

45:13.611 --> 45:15.272
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

45:15.412 --> 45:18.939
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.778
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

45:20.918 --> 45:23.216
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

45:23.354 --> 45:26.380
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

45:35.232 --> 45:38.793
<i>Jesus knows our every weakness</i>

45:40.638 --> 45:43.573
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

45:44.808 --> 45:48.972
<i>Are we weak and heavy-laden</i>

45:50.014 --> 45:53.006
<i>Cumbered with a load of care?</i>

45:54.251 --> 45:57.345
<i>Precious Savior still our refuge</i>

45:59.390 --> 46:01.984
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer...</i>

46:14.004 --> 46:17.064
- Daniel, may I speak with you?
- Yes, come in.

46:19.209 --> 46:22.178
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

46:22.312 --> 46:24.507
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46:24.648 --> 46:26.548
How is all the work coming?

46:26.684 --> 46:28.117
Everything's good.

46:28.218 --> 46:31.346
- All the men are provided for?
- Of course.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.289
Spirits seem high.

46:37.761 --> 46:41.197
Is there anything
that you need from me?

46:44.301 --> 46:48.533
- Anything the church can do for you?
- I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

46:48.672 --> 46:51.004
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

46:51.141 --> 46:52.733
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

46:52.843 --> 46:54.811
- That's right.
- I will bless the well.

46:56.580 --> 46:59.276
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

46:59.383 --> 47:01.943
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when I...

47:02.052 --> 47:03.110
The derrick.

47:03.220 --> 47:07.020
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.284
When you walk up?

47:09.393 --> 47:13.295
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

47:13.397 --> 47:18.528
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

47:18.769 --> 47:21.169
and then you could say my name.

47:22.473 --> 47:24.031
That's fine.

47:25.042 --> 47:28.443
- And what happens then?
- Well, then we start the drill.

47:31.615 --> 47:35.244
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

47:35.385 --> 47:38.354
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

47:39.456 --> 47:42.550
- What time?
- What time's good for you, Eli?

47:42.693 --> 47:45.491
- 4:00.
- Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

47:46.597 --> 47:50.328
- My thanks for your visit.
- Good day. Thank you.

48:05.749 --> 48:07.717
Afternoon, everyone.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.644
Come with me.

48:16.059 --> 48:19.517
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

48:19.663 --> 48:21.460
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

48:21.565 --> 48:23.396
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

48:23.534 --> 48:26.697
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

48:26.837 --> 48:29.499
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

48:29.640 --> 48:31.164
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

48:31.308 --> 48:33.208
just make it a simple blessing.

48:33.343 --> 48:35.106
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

48:35.212 --> 48:39.148
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

48:39.249 --> 48:42.241
and this is good. We stay together.

48:42.352 --> 48:44.115
We pray together, we work together,

48:44.221 --> 48:47.190
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

48:47.324 --> 48:49.792
we share in the wealth together.

48:52.229 --> 48:54.288
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

48:54.398 --> 48:57.561
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

48:57.668 --> 49:00.660
a proud daughter of these hills,

49:00.804 --> 49:04.501
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

49:04.641 --> 49:06.666
God bless you all.

49:06.810 --> 49:07.902
Amen.

49:08.011 --> 49:09.308
Now go.

49:14.284 --> 49:16.047
Won't be a minute.

49:19.122 --> 49:21.090
Fast as you can, H.W.

49:24.595 --> 49:26.722
Are you ready to do this?

49:36.573 --> 49:39.041
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

49:42.946 --> 49:47.042
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

49:47.150 --> 49:49.880
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

49:50.621 --> 49:55.058
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

51:08.031 --> 51:09.555
Mary.

51:11.234 --> 51:12.861
Mary Sunday.

51:15.706 --> 51:18.436
- Do you like your new dress?
- Yes. Thank you.

51:18.542 --> 51:21.443
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

51:22.312 --> 51:24.837
- Are you happy I came here?
- Yes.

51:26.550 --> 51:30.247
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

51:31.121 --> 51:32.986
Better not, right?

51:33.657 --> 51:35.648
I'll take care of you.

51:36.760 --> 51:41.891
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

51:42.032 --> 51:45.058
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

51:54.211 --> 51:55.644
Daniel?

51:59.316 --> 52:03.480
It's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

52:06.023 --> 52:07.183
Daniel.

52:09.593 --> 52:10.787
Daniel.

52:13.730 --> 52:14.992
Daniel!

52:16.566 --> 52:17.760
Daniel!

52:17.868 --> 52:19.130
What?

52:21.004 --> 52:23.097
Lost a man down the well.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.771
- What man?
- Joe Gundha.

52:31.782 --> 52:33.841
- Did I know him?
- No.

52:34.351 --> 52:35.409
What happened?

52:43.093 --> 52:44.492
Pick it up.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.754
Set the brake.

52:46.863 --> 52:49.161
- Tie it down.
- Tie it on.

52:53.770 --> 52:55.101
Shit!

52:57.174 --> 52:59.972
God damn it. Where's the body?

53:00.310 --> 53:03.302
- They're fishing it out now.
- All right.

53:06.683 --> 53:09.311
- Where's the bit?
- It's on the deck.

53:52.863 --> 53:55.696
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

53:56.833 --> 53:58.095
And...

53:59.736 --> 54:01.294
Set up a tent.

54:01.404 --> 54:05.363
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

54:06.009 --> 54:07.408
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

54:11.348 --> 54:13.373
Shut down till midday.

54:44.681 --> 54:50.085
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

54:50.187 --> 54:53.088
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

54:56.726 --> 55:00.822
And it rolled down into my stomach.

55:02.832 --> 55:04.697
It sloshed around.

55:06.102 --> 55:09.970
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

55:13.210 --> 55:17.408
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

55:21.785 --> 55:23.946
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

55:25.121 --> 55:27.453
you have arthritis, don't you?

55:27.591 --> 55:29.582
- Yes, I do, Eli.
- Yes.

55:29.693 --> 55:33.288
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

55:34.464 --> 55:38.924
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

55:39.069 --> 55:44.097
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

55:46.576 --> 55:48.601
It is a gentle whisper.

55:54.985 --> 55:57.351
Get out of here, ghost.

55:59.923 --> 56:02.255
Get out of here, ghost.

56:04.294 --> 56:05.727
Get out.

56:06.329 --> 56:09.230
Get out of here, ghost.

56:11.601 --> 56:14.764
Get out of here, ghost.

56:14.904 --> 56:18.806
...and enter this woman's body now.
- Get out of here, ghost.

56:18.908 --> 56:23.743
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

56:24.948 --> 56:26.643
For if you do,

56:26.750 --> 56:32.245
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

56:32.389 --> 56:35.881
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

56:36.026 --> 56:38.392
and thrust back to perdition!

56:38.528 --> 56:42.225
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

56:42.365 --> 56:46.324
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

56:46.436 --> 56:50.167
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

56:50.273 --> 56:55.006
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

56:55.145 --> 56:58.171
Get out of here, ghost!

57:01.351 --> 57:02.943
And it left!

57:03.720 --> 57:05.711
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

57:07.257 --> 57:09.691
- Praise the Lord and his holy days!
- Praise God!

57:09.826 --> 57:13.262
- Amen! Thank you.
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

57:14.531 --> 57:16.692
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

57:20.303 --> 57:22.032
Dance with me.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.611
- Thanks for coming.
- It was a wonderful sermon.

57:31.715 --> 57:34.115
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.089
Eli.

57:42.659 --> 57:45.457
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

57:46.696 --> 57:48.391
Yes, I heard.

57:48.498 --> 57:50.898
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.232
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

57:55.338 --> 57:58.171
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

57:58.308 --> 58:00.401
It is terrible to think of that well

58:00.510 --> 58:02.375
- working away out there...
- These men work in 12-hour shifts.

58:02.479 --> 58:03.468
...unblessed.
- They need their rest.

58:03.613 --> 58:05.342
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

58:05.448 --> 58:08.212
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

58:08.318 --> 58:09.785
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

58:09.919 --> 58:12.080
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

58:12.188 --> 58:14.315
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

58:14.457 --> 58:16.425
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

58:16.559 --> 58:17.753
More could have been done.

58:17.894 --> 58:22.888
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

58:29.239 --> 58:31.537
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

58:31.641 --> 58:33.768
find their way
back to his family, please?

58:33.910 --> 58:35.377
Thank you.

58:35.912 --> 58:39.040
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

58:39.149 --> 58:42.118
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

58:42.786 --> 58:47.246
- We need more room.
- That was one goddamn hell of a show.

58:48.391 --> 58:50.916
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:46.270
Gas, gas, gas!

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:58.445
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.395
Put that fire out!

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.026
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

01:01:45.602 --> 01:01:47.832
- Hand him down!
- Here.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:54.068
- Got him?
- I've got him!

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.749
Oh, God.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.566
Come on.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.272
Open the door.

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.827
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:55.635
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:59.873
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:01.476
- Did you see this?
- No.

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:02.635
Tell me where it hurts.

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:05.305
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:09.078
- I can't hear my voice.
- Were you hit in the head?

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:14.314
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:16.449
I can't hear my voice.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:28.165
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:32.105
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.368
- Wait here.
- Don't leave!

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:37.946
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:38.945
- Don't leave!
- You're going to be fine!

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.037
Wait for me here!

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:43.141
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Don't leave!

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.016
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:50.022
Get me a hammer!

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.163
Get me a hammer!

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:02.432
Here you go.

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:29.095
Get back!

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.033
- Michael!
- Sir!

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.571
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:14.609
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:39.627
What are you looking
so miserable about?

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.602
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:45.400
No one can get at it except for me.

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:33.713
H.W. Okay?

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:36.282
No, he isn't.

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.893
- Where is he?
- Mess room.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.725
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:29.428
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.906
That's enough.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:52.022
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.028
- No. Nope.
- No, lad.

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.363
Give me that.

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:06.666
Steady. That's it.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:09.176
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Soon be over.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:13.044
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:17.953
Almost done.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.957
That's it.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.624
Come here. It's over. It's over.

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:35.550
Who do we know in San Francisco

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.890
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:46.162
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:52.838
How could you figure out that?

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:57.702
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.145
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:04.377
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.893
I'll do it right away.

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.793
When do we get our money, Daniel?

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:32.365
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:35.500
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:36.771
Can't you do that?

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.847
If you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.779
- Daniel.
- You shouldn't have done that.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:47.452
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.423
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:05.003
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.781
That's it, that's it.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:28.523
I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:35.162
I'm going to bury you underground.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:09.500
You are a stupid man, Abel.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:15.970
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:22.607
You let him in and do his work here,

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:26.711
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:30.792
I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:33.623
You didn't do anything but sit down.

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:37.465
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:45.300
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:50.537
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:58.353
I will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.785
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.518
- Son, don't do this, please!
- Be quiet!

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:08.687
Shut your mouth, Abel!
It was your stupid son!

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:12.767
It was Paul who told him to come here.
I know it.

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.597
He went to him and he said,

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:19.436
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:23.000
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:30.678
A stupid father to a stupid son.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:37.986
Get out of there!

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:10.318
Can I help you?

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:13.418
Daniel?

01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:17.260
- Who's that?
- My name is Henry.

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:19.633
Yeah?

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.202
I'm Henry.

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.764
What can I do for you?

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.444
I'm Henry Plainview.
I'm from Fond du Lac.

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.818
I'm your brother, from another mother.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.990
Ernest is my father.

01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:48.820
Who are you?

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:51.427
Henry.

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:22.954
- Mary Branch? Is that your mother?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.365
I read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:33.532
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:36.340
Our father's dead.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.177
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:42.944
When?

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:46.647
Three months ago.
I got a letter from Annabelle.

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.521
My sister, Annabelle?

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:55.190
- Where is she?
- Still at home. Fond du Lac.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:19:00.390
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:03.562
I'm coming from New Mexico.
I've been there.

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.638
I came to find you.

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.835
Did you know about me?

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:20.148
Do you have identification?

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:22.916
Do you have this letter?

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.140
- Where are you coming from?
- From New Mexico.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.185
Yes, I know, but from where?

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:50.708
Yes, I know, but from where?

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:53.879
Silver City.
I've been there for two years.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:59.758
I was trying drilling of my own for years.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:06.300
- Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
- Anything that produced?

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:09.394
No. Not like your success, no.

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:18.345
- Are you married?
- No.

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:22.840
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of very bad time.

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:26.716
I had nothing.
I was picked up in Louisiana.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:31.852
I worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:35.557
That was a very hard time.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.131
Are you married?

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.838
What were you in jail for?

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:49.468
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things I've gotten myself into,

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:53.105
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:57.015
But I've done my share of things

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:01.721
that shouldn't be talked about.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:27.273
Drink it. Drink it!

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.155
Come on.

01:22:42.825 --> 01:22:44.122
So...

01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:50.694
What do you want, Henry?

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.534
Nothing.

01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:01.837
If you can spare something,
I can work for you in any way.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:06.277
I know I'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond du Lac.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:09.648
- Do you have any money?
- Some.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:12.913
- Not much.
- Just answer me directly.

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:16.616
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:21.662
And it's better, I'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:24.698
I'd like to be here.

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:35.635
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

01:23:37.813 --> 01:23:39.838
I won't need any favors.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:45.979
Good.

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:14.008
<i>What did my mother know?</i>

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:18.279
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:23.382
<i>I don't know if she knew and looked</i>
<i>the other way, if she never knew.</i>

01:24:26.128 --> 01:24:27.891
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:32.800
<i>I know you didn't get on with our father.</i>

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:41.737
I worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:47.205
I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't.

01:24:48.951 --> 01:24:51.476
I don't like to explain myself.

01:24:57.526 --> 01:25:01.758
- Are you an angry man, Henry?
- About what?

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:06.363
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:09.603
I don't think so, no.

01:25:14.076 --> 01:25:16.408
I have a competition in me.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:20.046
I want no one else to succeed.

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:29.581
- I hate most people.
- That part of me is gone.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.693
Working and not succeeding,

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:37.788
all my failures have left me...

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.701
I just don't care.

01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:47.000
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:53.947
There are times when I look at people
and I see nothing worth liking.

01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:03.982
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:11.499
What will you do about your boy?

01:26:19.241 --> 01:26:20.868
I don't know.

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:24.845
Maybe it'll change.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:29.416
Does your sound come back to you?
I don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:33.715
- Doctor might not know that.
- Where's his mother?

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:42.720
I don't want to talk about those things.

01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:48.298
I see the worst in people, Henry.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:54.172
I don't need to look past seeing them
to get all I need.

01:26:56.344 --> 01:27:00.303
I've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:07.352
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:11.184
I can't keep doing this on my own

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:19.559
with these people.

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:01.932
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:47.737
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:50.609
I'll be right back.

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:55.451
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:58.355
I'll be right back.

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:52.910
No! No!

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:55.844
No!

01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:07.218
- Tilford!
- Plainview.

01:31:07.362 --> 01:31:09.660
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview from Fond du Lac.

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.391
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

01:31:11.533 --> 01:31:14.001
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:17.402
So...

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.166
- Shall we?
- Yes.

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:29.544
How's your boy?

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:33.051
- Thank you for asking.
- Is there anything we can do?

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:35.588
Thanks for asking is enough.

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:39.249
So what are your plans?

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:44.260
Is this about buying up my tracts here?

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:45.457
Yes.

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:48.400
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:52.700
- We'd like that, too.
- What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:57.403
- We'll offer 150,000 for full title.
- That's a deal. What's next?

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:02.808
You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:04.407
- that was damaged...
- I have three wells proven.

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:08.613
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.794
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:17.228
from one minute to the next.

01:32:19.067 --> 01:32:21.831
And what else would I do with myself?

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:27.940
- Are you asking me?
- What else would I do with myself?

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.669
Take care of your son.

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:34.815
I don't know what you would do.

01:32:37.419 --> 01:32:39.887
If you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.683
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:45.017
You know why.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.991
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:50.531
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:52.599
I've scratched around the dirt, son.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.691
You going to change
your shipping costs?

01:32:54.836 --> 01:32:57.805
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.468
You don't own the railroads?

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.040
'Course you do. Of course you do.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:12.185
Where you going to put it all?

01:33:13.221 --> 01:33:14.654
Where?

01:33:16.491 --> 01:33:20.484
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:22.289
But if you can't pull it off,

01:33:22.397 --> 01:33:26.493
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

01:33:27.502 --> 01:33:32.132
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.571
You spend time with your boy.

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.770
It's a great discovery.

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.806
Now, let us help you.

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:53.118
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:55.456
It might be more important now
that you've proven the field

01:33:55.597 --> 01:33:57.462
and we're offering to buy you out.

01:33:57.599 --> 01:33:59.794
One night I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.903
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to cut your throat.

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.164
What?

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:06.201
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.604
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard what you said,

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:10.210
- why did you say it?
- You don't tell me about my son.

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:12.506
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

01:34:12.614 --> 01:34:15.674
- You don't tell me about my son.
- I'm not telling you anything!

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:19.583
I'm asking you to be reasonable.
If I've offended you, I apologize.

01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:21.882
You'll see what I can do.

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:33.862
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:36.493
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

01:34:36.638 --> 01:34:38.469
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

01:34:38.573 --> 01:34:41.701
What's this? Why don't I own this?

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:49.207
- Why don't I own this?
- That's the Bandy tract.

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:53.181
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:55.722
He had hoped to speak with you.

01:34:59.928 --> 01:35:03.420
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

01:35:06.401 --> 01:35:10.462
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:13.130
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

01:35:13.775 --> 01:35:17.472
- I can go to him again.
- No, I'll go and talk to the man.

01:35:17.612 --> 01:35:20.513
I'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

01:35:24.352 --> 01:35:26.786
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:41.033
- How big is his room?
- He's sharing with another boy.

01:35:41.169 --> 01:35:44.002
- Who?
- An older boy. About 12.

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:47.131
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

01:35:52.347 --> 01:35:56.750
- How big is the room?
- It's a fair size. Got enough space.

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:02.284
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:19.131
- Are you the son of William Bandy?
- Grandson.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.003
- Is he here?
- No, he's out.

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:22.200
Where is he?

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:25.210
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:32.652
I'm Daniel Plainview. I want to talk
with him about his property.

01:36:32.754 --> 01:36:37.623
- About what?
- I believe I'll talk with him about that.

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:40.526
- You're that oilman, aren't you?
- That's right.

01:36:40.662 --> 01:36:42.630
We don't want you drilling out here.

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:46.131
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

01:36:46.234 --> 01:36:47.292
Few days.

01:36:47.402 --> 01:36:49.996
Tell him I'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:52.334
And I'll be back in a week.

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:13.572
Put that in a glass case.

01:39:14.482 --> 01:39:16.347
Here's to Union Oil.

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.109
Hundred miles of pipeline,

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:20.686
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:21.755
Cheers.

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:49.610
<i>There's that house in Fond du Lac</i>

01:39:51.519 --> 01:39:54.784
<i>that John Hollister built.</i>
<i>Do you remember it?</i>

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:01.094
I thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house I'd ever seen,

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.822
and I wanted it.

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:06.032
I wanted to live in it.

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:07.691
And eat in it.

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:10.161
And clean it.

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:17.474
And even as a boy, I wanted
to have children to run around in it.

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.910
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

01:40:22.617 --> 01:40:24.244
And you should.

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:29.683
- Where are you going to build it?
- Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:35.357
Would you make it look like that house?

01:40:40.101 --> 01:40:43.559
I think if I saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:52.479
We can eat and get some women.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.576
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

01:41:01.322 --> 01:41:05.258
I say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:09.390
Yeah.

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.742
Can I have some money, please?

01:42:38.152 --> 01:42:40.552
Can I have some money, please?

01:43:29.637 --> 01:43:32.128
I want you to tell me something.

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:36.970
What?

01:43:38.012 --> 01:43:41.470
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:57.190
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:03.726
- I can't remember...
- Who are you?

01:44:06.674 --> 01:44:08.574
I'll leave, Daniel.

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:11.902
Who are you?

01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:16.773
I'm no one.

01:44:17.852 --> 01:44:20.116
Just let me get up and go.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:24.488
Do I have a brother?

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:33.661
I met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

01:44:36.203 --> 01:44:39.297
We were friends for months.

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:42.708
Working in King City.

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:47.812
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:51.210
We didn't have any money.

01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:58.354
He died of tuberculosis.

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.624
He wasn't harmed.

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:04.893
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

01:45:06.734 --> 01:45:08.998
But he told me about you,

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:14.337
and I just took his story,

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:19.842
used his diary.

01:45:23.484 --> 01:45:24.451
Daniel.

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:29.419
Daniel, I'm your friend.

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:34.059
I'm not trying to hurt you.

01:45:34.195 --> 01:45:35.423
Never.

01:45:36.564 --> 01:45:38.088
Just survive.

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:39.860
No!

01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:50.957
Who is it?

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:53.726
I'm Bandy.

01:49:06.507 --> 01:49:08.372
Yes. Yes.

01:49:10.878 --> 01:49:12.607
William Bandy.

01:49:15.816 --> 01:49:18.444
Yeah, I'd like to lease your land.

01:49:20.888 --> 01:49:24.449
I had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

01:49:24.558 --> 01:49:26.822
When you were leasing land.

01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:29.858
That's right, yes.

01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:34.090
My boy's been very sick, you know.

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:37.760
This was before your boy got sick.

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:45.402
Now, I know
that you would like to build a pipeline

01:49:45.546 --> 01:49:48.208
through my property.

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:52.445
- Is that right, what I've heard?
- It's absolutely right. And,

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:54.120
well...

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.653
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried with your consent.

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:01.317
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

01:50:01.462 --> 01:50:02.622
God.

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:07.126
God has told me what you must do.

01:50:11.505 --> 01:50:13.234
And what is that?

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:18.110
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:21.847
But I am.

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:26.079
I have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
I have been.

01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:31.920
It's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.321
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:41.734
I'll pay you $3,000.

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:47.135
I'd like you to be part of our church.

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:50.942
I'll pay you $5,000.

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:53.512
Be baptized.

01:50:54.882 --> 01:50:58.716
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:07.859
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:10.931
My sin of drilling?

01:52:01.615 --> 01:52:05.608
<i>I truly wish everyone could be saved,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:07.652
<i>Yes.</i>

01:52:07.788 --> 01:52:10.484
<i>I am afraid that's just not the case.</i>

01:52:11.358 --> 01:52:15.852
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

01:52:15.996 --> 01:52:18.624
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:23.499
I wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

01:52:23.637 --> 01:52:27.095
You will never be saved if you...

01:52:27.207 --> 01:52:29.175
Reject the blood.

01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:31.170
Good.

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:36.705
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

01:52:39.386 --> 01:52:40.978
A new member?

01:52:45.459 --> 01:52:47.222
I'll ask it again.

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:51.925
Is there a sinner here looking for God?

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:53.225
Yes.

01:52:57.337 --> 01:52:58.770
Allow me.

01:53:01.008 --> 01:53:03.772
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:07.540
Thank you, Eli.

01:53:08.682 --> 01:53:13.779
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:17.482
- Daniel, are you a sinner?
- Yes.

01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:20.287
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

01:53:20.394 --> 01:53:24.228
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. It's all right.

01:53:25.032 --> 01:53:27.330
- Yes.
- Down on your knees.

01:53:27.434 --> 01:53:28.992
Pray to him.

01:53:30.404 --> 01:53:34.773
Look up to the sky and say it.

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:39.538
What do you want me to say?

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.074
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:49.383
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:53.755
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.920
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:59.464
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.760
So say it now. I am a sinner.

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:03.768
- I am a sinner.
- Say it louder.

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:06.600
- I am a sinner.
- I am a sinner.

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.640
Louder, Daniel! I am a sinner!

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:11.710
- I am a sinner.
- I am sorry, Lord.

01:54:11.812 --> 01:54:13.973
- I am sorry, Lord.
- I want the blood.

01:54:14.114 --> 01:54:17.481
- I want the blood.
- You have abandoned your child.

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.548
I have abandoned my child.

01:54:19.653 --> 01:54:21.985
- I will never backslide.
- I will never backslide.

01:54:22.122 --> 01:54:25.114
I was lost, but now I am found.

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:29.160
- I was lost, but now I'm found.
- I have abandoned my child.

01:54:30.931 --> 01:54:34.094
Say it. Say it.

01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:37.227
- I abandoned my child.
- Say it louder. Say it louder!

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.430
I've abandoned my child!

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.865
I've abandoned my child!

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:45.000
I've abandoned my boy!

01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:47.545
Now beg for the blood!

01:54:48.749 --> 01:54:50.614
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:53.481
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

01:54:53.587 --> 01:54:57.353
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

01:54:57.491 --> 01:55:00.221
- Yes, I do.
- Get out of here, devil!

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.158
Out, devil! Out, sin!

01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:05.855
- Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
- Do you accept

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:09.867
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:15.602
- Get out of here, ghost!
- Where is your Lord, Eli?

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:19.803
- Get out! Go back where you belong!
- Where is he? There he is!

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:23.541
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.083
Yes, I do.

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:32.154
<i>Would you be free</i>
<i>from the burden of sin?</i>

01:55:32.292 --> 01:55:34.624
<i>There's power in the blood</i>

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:36.786
<i>Power in the blood</i>

01:55:37.063 --> 01:55:38.860
<i>Would you o'er evil a victory win?</i>

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:41.160
There's a pipeline.

01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:45.465
<i>There's wonderful power in the blood</i>

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:49.974
<i>There is power, power</i>
<i>wonder-working power</i>

01:55:50.076 --> 01:55:53.773
<i>In the blood of the Lamb</i>

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.643
Praise the Lord!

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:03.120
Welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:16.731
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:19.437
God bless you.

01:56:22.609 --> 01:56:24.270
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:26.645
Welcome home, brother.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.738
That's enough. That's enough, now.

01:56:32.986 --> 01:56:37.150
He must take the spirit in on his own.

01:56:39.926 --> 01:56:41.791
We have a new member.

01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:44.055
- Yes, brother.
- Hallelujah.

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:46.132
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:50.394
- My sweet Mary.
- Mr. Plainview has been generous

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:53.233
enough to make a $5,000 donation

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:56.399
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:11.847
That does me good.
That does me good.

01:58:13.954 --> 01:58:15.785
Welcome home, son.

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:20.359
Welcome home, son.

01:58:24.297 --> 01:58:26.356
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:29.458
- Mr. Plainview.
- Fletcher.

01:58:32.272 --> 01:58:34.365
You're too heavy for me.

01:58:37.444 --> 01:58:40.140
Do you want to get something to eat?

01:58:41.348 --> 01:58:45.648
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

01:59:06.773 --> 01:59:08.331
Come here.

01:59:15.215 --> 01:59:16.978
I love you, son.

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:21.012
Let's take a look at you.

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:26.156
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

01:59:50.216 --> 01:59:53.515
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:57.420
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

01:59:58.058 --> 01:59:59.548
You hungry?

02:00:00.627 --> 02:00:01.719
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

02:00:01.861 --> 02:00:04.853
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:09.024
- And goat's milk.
- Very good, sir.

02:00:15.842 --> 02:00:18.777
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:23.805
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:26.646
'Cause I need you. Need your help.

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:30.745
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

02:00:38.565 --> 02:00:40.260
Good afternoon.

02:00:56.416 --> 02:00:58.475
- How are you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.

02:00:58.585 --> 02:01:01.383
- We need four.
- I'll have them right up.

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:07.549
- Good afternoon, Daniel.
- Tilford.

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.025
Good afternoon.

02:01:10.597 --> 02:01:15.864
- Hello! H.M. Tilford!
- You don't have to shout.

02:01:17.904 --> 02:01:19.303
Pleasure.

02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:26.274
It's good to be in Little B.

02:01:27.547 --> 02:01:30.846
- Could use some rain out here.
- Yeah, we could.

02:01:31.718 --> 02:01:34.812
- There we go.
- R.J., how's the London broil?

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:37.616
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

02:01:37.724 --> 02:01:41.990
- R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:47.999
I am sorry about that, sir.
I'll have your steaks right out.

02:01:57.844 --> 02:02:00.404
- So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
- Is it?

02:02:00.547 --> 02:02:02.174
It's delicious.

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:08.187
Sounds good to me.

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:14.055
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.061
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:21.759
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:25.359
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

02:02:25.471 --> 02:02:27.132
...$150,000.
- Yes.

02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:29.538
We needed the money to drill.

02:02:29.676 --> 02:02:31.906
- Who is this guy?
- I go out to meet him.

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:34.775
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

02:02:34.914 --> 02:02:36.814
Offered him a million dollars.

02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:40.147
- Turned us down flat.
- Well, I'm hungry.

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:44.916
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:47.492
- All the way around?
- All right.

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:51.761
Hold on.

02:02:55.535 --> 02:02:57.799
I want you to look over there.

02:02:57.904 --> 02:03:00.702
- Daniel, let me introduce...
- Look over there. You see?

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.933
That's my son. See him?

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:05.374
- Yes.
- Do you see?

02:03:07.714 --> 02:03:09.147
I see him.

02:03:10.016 --> 02:03:12.883
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:18.548
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

02:03:20.026 --> 02:03:21.891
Daniel...

02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:24.560
So what do you see?

02:03:26.566 --> 02:03:29.729
- I'm very happy for you that the deal...
- Yes, I made a deal with Union.

02:03:29.836 --> 02:03:32.202
- My son is happy. He's safe.
- Congratulations.

02:03:32.305 --> 02:03:35.468
- I'm taking care of him now, so...
- Excellent.

02:03:36.776 --> 02:03:39.768
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:47.283
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:03:49.122 --> 02:03:50.783
Yes, you do.

02:03:51.691 --> 02:03:53.158
Excuse me, gentlemen.

02:03:53.493 --> 02:03:56.724
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:02.894
I told you what I was going to do.

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:14.440
My son.

02:04:32.498 --> 02:04:35.797
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:39.063
- Yes, I'm going on a mission.
- Where you going?

02:04:39.172 --> 02:04:41.333
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

02:04:41.474 --> 02:04:43.806
Well, I want you to know...

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.808
Three quarters of an hour.

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:47.469
...you done a great job for us.

02:04:47.613 --> 02:04:50.480
- Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
- I thank you very much.

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:53.848
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

02:07:02.849 --> 02:07:06.649
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

02:07:07.687 --> 02:07:12.647
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:55.821
Come in, come in.

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.818
Can we be alone?

02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:28.621
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:40.764
- I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
- You can't speak.

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:43.103
So why don't you flap your hands about

02:09:43.209 --> 02:09:46.770
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

02:09:54.754 --> 02:09:57.484
Or do you think I don't know?

02:10:11.971 --> 02:10:14.201
This is hard for me to say.

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:19.437
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

02:10:22.715 --> 02:10:26.708
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

02:10:30.156 --> 02:10:32.021
I'm leaving here.

02:10:33.459 --> 02:10:35.791
I'm going to Mexico.

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:38.897
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

02:10:40.566 --> 02:10:42.659
I miss working outside.

02:10:43.703 --> 02:10:45.568
I miss the fields.

02:10:48.541 --> 02:10:50.668
It'll only be for a time,

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:54.209
for me to do my own drilling

02:10:55.915 --> 02:10:58.042
and start my own company.

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:05.513
It's time to make a change.

02:11:18.571 --> 02:11:21.062
This makes you my competitor.

02:11:25.044 --> 02:11:30.141
- No. No, it's not like that.
- It is like that, boy.

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:33.351
Your own company, huh?

02:11:33.786 --> 02:11:35.276
That's right.

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:39.386
In Mexico?

02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:41.918
Yes.

02:11:42.027 --> 02:11:47.090
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

02:11:49.135 --> 02:11:52.468
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:57.739
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:59.310
Then say it.

02:11:59.445 --> 02:12:01.140
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

02:12:01.247 --> 02:12:04.910
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:25.697
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:28.832
I'm going away from you.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.542
That wasn't so hard, was it?

02:12:39.485 --> 02:12:42.113
Killing us with what you're doing.

02:12:45.024 --> 02:12:48.482
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:51.994
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

02:12:52.131 --> 02:12:54.429
You're not my son.

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:57.730
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

02:12:57.837 --> 02:13:01.796
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:04.972
You're an orphan!

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.910
Did you ever hear that word?

02:13:11.417 --> 02:13:13.317
Tell him what I said.

02:13:14.086 --> 02:13:17.055
You operated here today like one.

02:13:18.691 --> 02:13:21.159
I should have seen this coming.

02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:27.496
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

02:13:27.633 --> 02:13:31.000
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

02:13:31.136 --> 02:13:34.765
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

02:13:34.874 --> 02:13:37.741
You're someone else's.

02:13:39.178 --> 02:13:42.636
This anger. Your maliciousness.

02:13:43.749 --> 02:13:46.650
Backwards dealings with me.

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:52.279
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

02:13:55.094 --> 02:14:00.054
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

02:14:01.567 --> 02:14:03.330
Did you get that?

02:14:04.570 --> 02:14:06.333
So now you know.

02:14:09.642 --> 02:14:13.942
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:43.364
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

02:14:53.052 --> 02:14:57.318
I thank God I have none of you in me.

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:06.687
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.693
Bastard from a basket.

02:15:13.105 --> 02:15:15.300
Bastard from a basket!

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:26.207
You're a bastard from a basket!

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:30.544
<i>Get up, Mr. Daniel.</i>

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.477
<i>Mr. Daniel.</i>

02:16:38.457 --> 02:16:41.017
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:46.527
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

02:16:49.268 --> 02:16:50.860
Sir?

02:17:04.383 --> 02:17:06.316
You can leave us now.

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:15.593
Daniel.

02:17:18.964 --> 02:17:20.124
Daniel.

02:17:22.734 --> 02:17:25.931
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

02:17:30.609 --> 02:17:33.577
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:47.553
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

02:17:49.661 --> 02:17:51.594
I'll make us a drink.

02:17:58.170 --> 02:18:01.333
Your home is a miracle.

02:18:02.608 --> 02:18:03.876
It's beautiful.

02:18:03.876 --> 02:18:04.240
It's beautiful.

02:18:04.877 --> 02:18:06.936
God bless it.

02:18:07.079 --> 02:18:11.072
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

02:18:12.351 --> 02:18:14.147
Far and wide.

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:18.718
So much travel for Him.

02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:25.827
I've been working in radio.

02:18:28.534 --> 02:18:32.493
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

02:18:33.539 --> 02:18:39.000
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:41.704
And we have a chance to catch up.

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:56.919
No. Thank you so much.

02:19:15.047 --> 02:19:16.571
My brother.

02:19:17.983 --> 02:19:21.248
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:27.351
We're such old friends. So much time.

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:36.959
Things go up, things go down,

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:41.369
but at least the Lord is always around.

02:19:42.975 --> 02:19:45.637
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

02:19:49.448 --> 02:19:52.417
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

02:19:53.785 --> 02:19:55.184
No. No.

02:19:57.623 --> 02:20:00.251
But I do come with some sad news.

02:20:01.994 --> 02:20:04.724
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

02:20:07.366 --> 02:20:10.699
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

02:20:11.637 --> 02:20:14.800
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:19.375
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

02:20:20.379 --> 02:20:24.975
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:27.643
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

02:20:27.753 --> 02:20:31.052
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:34.685
He is very good-looking.

02:20:36.895 --> 02:20:41.889
- And I do think he will have success.
- That's wonderful.

02:20:44.036 --> 02:20:46.800
Would you like me to speak with him?

02:20:54.212 --> 02:20:58.945
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

02:20:59.084 --> 02:21:01.314
with the Church of the Third Revelation

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:05.652
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

02:21:08.126 --> 02:21:09.718
I'm offering you to drill

02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:13.319
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

02:21:13.432 --> 02:21:17.562
- I'd be happy to work with you.
- You would?

02:21:19.171 --> 02:21:22.004
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:25.109
But there is one condition for this work.

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.700
All right.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:32.307
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:43.093
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

02:21:44.296 --> 02:21:46.662
And that God is a superstition.

02:21:52.771 --> 02:21:54.568
But that's a lie.

02:21:57.376 --> 02:21:59.901
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

02:22:14.192 --> 02:22:16.626
- When can we begin to drill?
- Very soon.

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:18.320
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

02:22:18.463 --> 02:22:20.363
It shouldn't take long.

02:22:20.499 --> 02:22:23.764
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

02:22:23.869 --> 02:22:27.134
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.602
That's only fair.

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:40.147
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:43.254
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

02:22:43.355 --> 02:22:46.847
- Say it like you mean it.
- Daniel.

02:22:47.392 --> 02:22:49.724
Say it like it's your sermon.

02:22:52.898 --> 02:22:54.525
Don't smile.

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:02.205
I am a false prophet.

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:05.640
- God is a superstition.
- Why don't you stand up?

02:23:08.713 --> 02:23:10.704
Put your glass down.

02:23:22.894 --> 02:23:26.455
I am a false prophet.

02:23:26.598 --> 02:23:29.658
- God is a superstition.
- Eli, stop.

02:23:29.768 --> 02:23:35.172
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

02:23:37.709 --> 02:23:41.475
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:43.172
Say it again.

02:23:44.249 --> 02:23:48.117
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:49.346
They can't hear you at the back.

02:23:49.488 --> 02:23:52.855
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.015
Say it again.

02:23:54.159 --> 02:23:58.789
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

02:23:58.897 --> 02:24:00.592
Say it again.

02:24:00.699 --> 02:24:04.430
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

02:24:05.637 --> 02:24:07.969
Those areas have been drilled.

02:24:11.076 --> 02:24:12.475
What?

02:24:12.611 --> 02:24:15.205
Those areas, they've been drilled.

02:24:16.815 --> 02:24:20.342
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, it's...

02:24:20.452 --> 02:24:21.783
It's called drainage, Eli.

02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:26.755
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, I get what's underneath it.

02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:31.389
But there are no derricks there.

02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:33.896
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:36.000
Do you understand, Eli?

02:24:36.735 --> 02:24:39.966
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:45.475
I drink your water. I drink it up every day.

02:24:46.478 --> 02:24:50.710
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:58.080
You can sit down again.

02:25:16.241 --> 02:25:17.572
Daniel.

02:25:20.845 --> 02:25:21.834
Daniel.

02:25:25.717 --> 02:25:27.014
Please.

02:25:29.654 --> 02:25:33.988
- I am in desperate times.
- I know.

02:25:34.092 --> 02:25:36.959
- I need a friend.
- Yes. Of course, you do.

02:25:37.362 --> 02:25:38.954
I've sinned.

02:25:40.732 --> 02:25:43.826
I need help. I'm a sinner.

02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:48.565
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:50.106
I'm so full of sin.

02:25:50.208 --> 02:25:53.473
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

02:25:53.612 --> 02:25:55.580
- Yes, He does, Daniel.
- Yes, He does.

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:58.274
Yes, He does!

02:25:58.416 --> 02:26:00.316
Yes, He does!

02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:07.183
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

02:26:07.292 --> 02:26:09.453
- And this...
- Oh, dear.

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:16.261
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

02:26:16.401 --> 02:26:18.665
My investments have...

02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:23.798
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:26.809
but He does these things all the time.

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:30.870
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:34.311
While we wait for His word!

02:26:34.452 --> 02:26:37.188
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

02:26:37.188 --> 02:26:37.415
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

02:26:39.824 --> 02:26:43.624
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

02:26:44.529 --> 02:26:47.464
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

02:26:47.599 --> 02:26:50.432
- Why are you talking about Paul?
- I did what your brother couldn't.

02:26:50.535 --> 02:26:53.060
- Don't say this to me.
- I broke you and I beat you.

02:26:53.972 --> 02:26:56.770
It was Paul told me about you.

02:26:56.908 --> 02:27:01.368
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:03.845
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:07.042
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:11.821
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:16.190
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

02:27:16.294 --> 02:27:19.821
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:25.700
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

02:27:26.905 --> 02:27:30.739
- You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
- No.

02:27:30.842 --> 02:27:33.470
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:34.942
No.

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:39.244
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

02:27:40.952 --> 02:27:44.319
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

02:27:44.456 --> 02:27:45.946
Where were you?

02:27:46.091 --> 02:27:50.790
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:53.864
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

02:27:53.965 --> 02:27:56.126
- If you would just take this lease...
- You lose.

02:27:56.267 --> 02:27:59.498
Drainage!

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:04.099
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:08.144
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.473
If you have a milkshake

02:28:12.584 --> 02:28:14.347
and I have a milkshake,

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:17.649
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

02:28:17.756 --> 02:28:19.314
Watch it.

02:28:20.759 --> 02:28:27.688
Now my straw reaches across the room

02:28:28.967 --> 02:28:31.765
and starts to drink your milkshake.

02:28:32.704 --> 02:28:36.470
I drink your milkshake!

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:42.134
- I drink it up!
- Don't bully me, Daniel.

02:28:44.883 --> 02:28:50.082
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:54.851
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

02:28:57.061 --> 02:28:59.359
- Daniel!
- Because I'm smarter than you!

02:28:59.464 --> 02:29:00.931
I'm older!

02:29:01.766 --> 02:29:03.597
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:06.135
- I'm not a false prophet...
- Help me! Help me!

02:29:06.237 --> 02:29:08.501
...you sniveling boy!

02:29:08.606 --> 02:29:15.273
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:18.349
- I told you I would eat you.
- We're family!

02:29:18.483 --> 02:29:22.920
- I told you I would eat you up!
- We're brothers! We're brothers!

02:29:30.028 --> 02:29:32.826
Daniel, please forgive me. I beg you.

02:29:36.501 --> 02:29:38.560
That's it. That's it.

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.432
Mr. Daniel?

02:30:50.341 --> 02:30:52.002
I'm finished.
