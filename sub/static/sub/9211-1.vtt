00:47.220 --> 00:49.431
- It's already recording...
- Okay.

00:50.474 --> 00:51.309
This is my home...

00:51.476 --> 00:54.354
- You look blurry. I'll zoom out.
- Okay.

00:55.147 --> 00:56.148
Good morning.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.984
- Got it?
- Okay, I got it.

00:58.234 --> 00:59.570
This is my home,...

01:01.447 --> 01:03.158
...which I am leaving for the weekend...

01:03.366 --> 01:06.036
...to investigate the Blair Witch.

01:07.163 --> 01:09.291
Essential reading: "How to Stay
Alive in the Woods",...

01:09.499 --> 01:11.126
...'cause you never know what's
gonna happen.

01:11.335 --> 01:12.962
And this is an important book...

01:13.212 --> 01:16.467
...because it has the article about what
happened at Coffin Rock.

01:16.717 --> 01:17.385
It looks pretty old...

01:17.551 --> 01:19.846
It's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.641
It's Mr. Punctuality.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.896
How are you this morning?

01:26.313 --> 01:26.980
Tired.

01:27.147 --> 01:28.649
So I got the CP up.

01:28.858 --> 01:29.525
Good.

01:30.777 --> 01:33.322
That's what we're shooting on.

01:33.531 --> 01:35.825
No one knows I took it,
but I got it.

01:36.076 --> 01:38.537
Come into the house. Come on.

01:40.123 --> 01:41.541
I can see you.

01:42.876 --> 01:45.421
We're not gonna bump into shit,
I'm going backwards now.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.549
We mustn't fuck up the cameras.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.510
So where's Mikey?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.471
- We have to go get him.
- Okay.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.597
At 8:30.

01:52.806 --> 01:53.640
Okay.

01:53.807 --> 01:56.603
We're already behind schedule, but
it's important to have juice.

01:56.770 --> 01:57.604
That's cool.

01:57.771 --> 01:59.398
I guess you're Mike!

02:00.942 --> 02:03.069
Wait. Stop.

02:06.866 --> 02:09.161
Don't we get to meet your Mama?

02:13.416 --> 02:15.127
See you later, Mom!

02:16.128 --> 02:17.839
How are you, Mike?

02:18.006 --> 02:19.174
I'm tired but I'm fine.

02:19.383 --> 02:21.844
I'm real excited about this.
Thank you for the opportunity.

02:22.053 --> 02:24.723
I'm very glad. Thanks for
getting the equipment together.

02:24.973 --> 02:27.101
We've got enough
battery power to...

02:27.268 --> 02:29.729
...fuel a small country for a month.

02:29.980 --> 02:33.318
We've got rice, fruit punch...

02:34.152 --> 02:35.696
Oatmeal Raisin, baby.

02:36.029 --> 02:37.907
The ultimate campfood.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.662
Feel how soft.

02:44.999 --> 02:48.087
- Marshmallows...
- Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart!

02:53.511 --> 02:55.054
Do you believe in ghosts?

02:55.388 --> 02:57.432
Ever heard of the Blair Witch?

03:00.061 --> 03:04.108
Sounds familiar.
My sister went to Blair High School.

03:04.525 --> 03:08.614
The woods around Halloween
are creepy.

03:08.781 --> 03:12.285
- Can you tell me a little more?
- I don't wanna go cheesy.

03:12.494 --> 03:15.456
I want to present
this straightforward.

03:15.623 --> 03:17.834
The legend is unsettling.

03:18.126 --> 03:19.628
Wanna get the...

03:20.671 --> 03:22.883
...ceremonial first slate?

03:23.884 --> 03:25.428
Absolutely.

03:27.430 --> 03:30.768
The first slate for our
first shot.

03:31.644 --> 03:35.065
Should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.901
A little blood-letting?

03:37.110 --> 03:38.486
No, we'll save that for later.

03:38.695 --> 03:40.489
Kiss the slate.

03:41.741 --> 03:43.326
It's the first slate.

03:43.493 --> 03:45.370
Marked by my lipstick.

03:45.537 --> 03:48.166
Mikey, kiss it, good luck.

03:48.416 --> 03:50.377
- There we go.
- Oh, he licked it. Bless him.

03:50.586 --> 03:52.463
Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.

03:53.131 --> 03:56.301
This is Burkittsville,
formerly Blair.

03:56.802 --> 03:59.764
A small quiet Maryland town.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.852
Like a small, quiet town anywhere.

04:03.060 --> 04:07.608
Some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago.

04:08.317 --> 04:11.279
Many remain, either on this hill...

04:11.738 --> 04:13.616
...or in the town below.

04:14.909 --> 04:18.414
An unusually high number of
children are buried here...

04:18.831 --> 04:21.125
...most of whom passed
in the 1940's.

04:21.918 --> 04:26.090
Yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time,...

04:26.424 --> 04:28.218
...not to us, anyway.

04:28.552 --> 04:30.513
Yet legend tells
A different story,...

04:30.763 --> 04:33.058
...whose evidence is all around us.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.394
Etched in stone.

04:42.195 --> 04:45.783
We have shot the first scene,
the cemetery scene.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.827
The opening is shot.

04:48.203 --> 04:51.791
We're doing a documentary
about the Blair Witch.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.756
- Have you heard of the Witch?
- That's an old, old story.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.132
As I remember,...

04:58.341 --> 05:01.428
...Mr. Parr was an old hermit,...

05:02.221 --> 05:05.642
...and he lived up on a mountain.
He'd been there,...

05:05.809 --> 05:07.186
...for a long, long, time.

05:07.353 --> 05:09.564
- You heard of the Blair Witch?
- Several times.

05:09.814 --> 05:12.026
What was the first incident?

05:12.193 --> 05:15.864
I've heard stories about it
from people and neighbors,

05:16.073 --> 05:19.243
I also saw a documentary on the
television...

05:19.494 --> 05:22.748
...about her and legends
of Maryland,...

05:22.915 --> 05:26.586
...my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early.

05:26.753 --> 05:30.175
They say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house...

05:30.341 --> 05:31.885
...the Blair witch will get you.

05:32.094 --> 05:36.391
In the fall or winter of 1940,...

05:36.600 --> 05:39.687
...some young kids
started disappearing.

05:39.979 --> 05:41.606
Nobody knew...

05:42.315 --> 05:44.527
...why they were disappearing.

05:46.863 --> 05:49.950
- A kind of an omen, isn't it?
- The creepiest story about her...

05:50.618 --> 05:52.913
...was that two men out hunting...

05:53.038 --> 05:56.709
...camped near the cabin
she's supposed to haunt...

05:56.960 --> 05:57.627
No. No.

05:57.752 --> 06:00.047
...and they just disappeared
forever.

06:00.798 --> 06:03.802
I'm just telling a scary story,
but it's not true.

06:04.011 --> 06:04.845
It's not true.

06:05.012 --> 06:08.350
One day, old Mr. Parr
came into the market...

06:08.600 --> 06:10.811
...and said "I'm finally finished".

06:10.978 --> 06:11.979
And what did he mean by that?

06:12.188 --> 06:13.815
Nobody knew at first...

06:14.024 --> 06:15.985
But the police finally...

06:16.151 --> 06:17.737
went up the mountain...

06:18.488 --> 06:22.702
...and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house.

06:23.161 --> 06:26.498
He would take the kids down
to the basement in twos...

06:26.665 --> 06:28.960
...and he'd make one
face the corner...

06:29.961 --> 06:31.755
...and he'd kill the other one...

06:32.256 --> 06:35.343
...then he'd kill the one in
the corner too.

06:35.802 --> 06:37.304
Those were the seven kids
that were missing

06:37.471 --> 06:40.475
They brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time...

06:40.642 --> 06:43.896
...it was terrible, it upset
the whole community.

06:44.105 --> 06:45.982
He said he couldn't take
the eyes watching him...

06:46.233 --> 06:50.071
...that's why he made them
face the corner like that.

06:50.238 --> 06:52.115
All my life I've believed...

06:52.282 --> 06:54.994
...in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff

06:55.119 --> 06:56.997
Do you believe there are some
in this area?

06:57.205 --> 06:57.873
Oh, definitely.

06:58.081 --> 07:00.042
- Do you believe in witchcraft?
- No.

07:01.002 --> 07:03.213
- Are you religious?
- Yep.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.340
Alrighty.

07:04.507 --> 07:08.679
Creepy stuff, but I think
something's happening with her.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.224
And do you think she could
still be up there now?

07:11.474 --> 07:13.185
- I don't go up there.
- You don't?

07:13.352 --> 07:14.728
I believe enough not to go.

07:14.853 --> 07:18.275
They say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.236
What? How are they haunted?

07:20.361 --> 07:24.533
Well there's not many people
who say that it's haunted...

07:24.700 --> 07:27.078
...but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who...

07:27.286 --> 07:28.288
Mary Brown?

07:28.455 --> 07:30.582
Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.

07:30.791 --> 07:32.669
How was she seen by the community?

07:32.919 --> 07:33.503
Crazy.

07:33.837 --> 07:37.759
There's the American flag,
it's Mary's house.

07:38.510 --> 07:39.594
I'm gonna bring her out.

07:39.803 --> 07:41.931
You look for the best light, okay?

07:42.139 --> 07:42.723
Okay.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.105
This is Mary's gate.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.860
I'm not even sure how to open it.

07:53.029 --> 07:55.949
And something interesting
happened to you once...

07:56.116 --> 07:58.244
You met the Blair witch?

07:59.120 --> 07:59.871
Yes.

08:00.038 --> 08:01.289
That is really...

08:01.623 --> 08:04.001
...kind of a scary story.

08:05.003 --> 08:06.338
To make ends meet...

08:06.505 --> 08:08.132
...my Dad and I

08:08.382 --> 08:10.593
...used to fish at Tappy's Creek.

08:10.927 --> 08:13.806
In Burkittsville.

08:14.432 --> 08:17.227
I was laying on the leaves...

08:17.936 --> 08:20.940
...watching my pole, and
looking at the sky...

08:21.357 --> 08:25.404
...and suddenly I felt
something near me...

08:25.905 --> 08:27.699
...an eerie feeling...

08:28.450 --> 08:30.411
...It was a woman...

08:30.995 --> 08:33.289
...only on her
arms and hands...

08:33.457 --> 08:35.333
...and everything...

08:35.543 --> 08:37.086
...she had hair...

08:37.796 --> 08:40.174
...dark, almost black hair...

08:40.841 --> 08:42.342
...like a horse...

08:42.594 --> 08:44.972
...like a fur, horse fur.

08:45.264 --> 08:46.515
Then on her arm...

08:46.933 --> 08:48.643
...she had a shawl...

08:49.436 --> 08:51.480
And she scared you,
or threatened you?

08:52.315 --> 08:55.736
She didn't say anything,
she just stared...

08:55.944 --> 08:57.822
...and then she opened her shawl...

08:58.156 --> 08:59.616
What was under there?

08:59.783 --> 09:02.787
She had hair on her
body like a horse.

09:02.995 --> 09:04.247
Hairy from head to toe?

09:04.456 --> 09:06.834
Yeah. And her legs...

09:07.167 --> 09:10.171
- How about her face?
- You could see she was a female.

09:10.881 --> 09:13.259
She was just strange looking.

09:14.010 --> 09:16.471
Thank God she's
not in the film business.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.851
She thinks she is.
She also says she's a ballerina.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.144
Get out.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.147
And she says she's a historian...

09:23.314 --> 09:24.148
I heard that.

09:24.315 --> 09:26.610
...and that she's a scientist
at the Department of Energy.

09:26.818 --> 09:29.989
I fucked up on Mary
with the depth of field.

09:30.198 --> 09:32.951
You measured it in meters?
We're not in Europe.

09:33.535 --> 09:35.580
The fucking lens
has meters on it.

09:35.830 --> 09:38.208
It also has our system.

09:39.168 --> 09:41.713
Nah, it has meters. Look.

09:43.799 --> 09:45.676
But it's an American camera.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.220
All those are meters.

09:47.596 --> 09:49.223
What about the brown ones?

09:49.390 --> 09:50.474
They're feet.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.435
The brown ones are on there, right?

09:52.644 --> 09:55.272
Yeah, but the white
ones are obvious.

09:55.397 --> 09:59.236
- Didn't you use this camera before?
- Yeah. Once before.

09:59.611 --> 10:01.405
How was today, guys?

10:02.699 --> 10:04.326
I learned a lot, man.

10:04.493 --> 10:06.287
About Mary Brown?

10:06.662 --> 10:09.124
No, I learned a lot about...

10:09.875 --> 10:10.959
16 mill?

10:11.377 --> 10:13.922
...about shooting, just
shooting documentaries.

10:15.132 --> 10:17.009
- We kicked some ass today.
- Cheers.

10:17.385 --> 10:18.553
Very good day.

10:18.761 --> 10:19.429
Excellent day.

10:19.638 --> 10:20.889
Very good first day.

10:21.098 --> 10:24.602
Let's do an equipment check,
after I call my mom.

10:24.811 --> 10:27.898
- I got a bag of Utz and a beer.
- We don't need that on film.

10:28.232 --> 10:30.026
So I guess you're covered then.

10:30.235 --> 10:33.823
Could you run it a little
to check it's okay?

10:34.365 --> 10:35.200
Sure.

10:35.575 --> 10:39.247
I just want to check it's loaded
properly so we can shoot...

10:40.582 --> 10:43.294
Okay, that's good, that's good.

10:43.586 --> 10:45.630
That's good, thank you.

10:46.423 --> 10:48.884
Let's relax, because we've got
a long day tomorrow.

10:49.135 --> 10:51.346
Today's been easy.

10:51.554 --> 10:54.183
We're gonna have to do a lot
of hiking, carry a lot of weight.

10:54.391 --> 10:55.810
We're preparing.

10:55.977 --> 10:59.231
Shut up, smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

10:59.481 --> 11:03.070
- I'm freaking out.
- You can't, you're the director.

11:03.278 --> 11:07.116
I fucking have to do this now,
okay? Do we have any weed?

11:08.410 --> 11:09.578
Here I go.

11:10.371 --> 11:12.081
Drink! Drink!

11:14.918 --> 11:16.879
I hate fucking scotch.

11:23.763 --> 11:24.848
There's my friend Josh.

11:25.557 --> 11:26.559
How are you?

11:26.726 --> 11:27.643
I'm hurtin'.

11:27.852 --> 11:29.729
I'm not ready for that thing yet.

11:30.063 --> 11:31.607
I know you don't like it.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.029
Hello. Welcome to day two.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.533
The trail is along here.

11:38.783 --> 11:41.245
It should be pretty obvious.

11:42.747 --> 11:44.624
You guys heard of
the Blair witch?

11:44.916 --> 11:47.670
I heard the myth. I don't
really believe much in it.

11:47.962 --> 11:48.796
The myth?

11:48.921 --> 11:50.632
That's all I think it is.

11:50.841 --> 11:51.925
What'd you say, sir?

11:52.092 --> 11:54.470
- I said damn fool kids never learn.
- Shut up.

11:54.762 --> 11:56.223
Damn fool kids never learn?

11:56.389 --> 11:57.140
That's what I said.

11:57.307 --> 11:58.642
Why do you say that?

11:58.851 --> 12:01.146
First of all, can I
have your permission...

12:01.354 --> 12:04.108
...to use your image on a
video documentary?

12:04.525 --> 12:06.486
I don't care about that, but...

12:06.778 --> 12:08.489
You have to say yes or no, sir,

12:08.656 --> 12:10.032
- Watch it.
- I'm sorry.

12:10.199 --> 12:10.950
Yeah, sure, okay.

12:11.576 --> 12:14.830
Some girl, in the late 1800's...

12:15.331 --> 12:17.626
...Robin Weaver, I
believe her name was,...

12:17.959 --> 12:21.798
...supposedly wandered
off into the woods.

12:22.173 --> 12:25.135
No "supposedly" about it.
She wandered off!

12:25.553 --> 12:27.263
- Okay, wandered off.
- And got lost.

12:27.472 --> 12:28.557
She got lost.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.768
Wasn't no "supposedly".

12:31.602 --> 12:33.021
Three days later...

12:33.229 --> 12:36.484
...she appears back on her
grandmother's porch.

12:37.610 --> 12:40.322
And everybody's mystified.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.243
- She was babbling something...
- Her story.

12:43.451 --> 12:45.662
Babbling something about...

12:45.913 --> 12:48.458
...an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

12:50.335 --> 12:54.007
I saw... just by that
tree up the creek...

12:55.050 --> 12:56.510
...about a hundred yards,

12:57.052 --> 13:00.974
I saw a white misty thing.
Can't tell you what it was.

13:01.183 --> 13:04.354
Like grey vapor rising
out of the trees.

13:04.562 --> 13:05.981
Right out of the water.

13:06.189 --> 13:07.107
Right out of the water?

13:07.316 --> 13:09.694
Up the side of the trees,
Then it disappeared.

13:09.944 --> 13:11.363
You're full of it.

13:11.530 --> 13:13.657
I'm not. And I wasn't
drinking that day, either.

13:13.950 --> 13:14.701
Sure you weren't.

13:14.909 --> 13:16.870
How is that related to the
story of Coffin Rock?

13:17.079 --> 13:19.624
It all ties in to the
story of Coffin Rock.

13:19.791 --> 13:20.458
How's that?

13:21.877 --> 13:24.964
Anybody round here...

13:25.173 --> 13:28.177
...knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years.

13:28.427 --> 13:29.804
That's bullshit.

13:32.599 --> 13:34.560
These woods are thick.

13:35.186 --> 13:36.437
You excited?

13:37.480 --> 13:38.398
You got it.

13:39.066 --> 13:42.070
I hope he's not shooting a
whole shitload of stock.

14:04.808 --> 14:06.602
I could help, but I'd
rather record.

14:06.811 --> 14:07.562
Okay.

14:07.854 --> 14:10.607
Packs on, we're ready to go.

14:10.774 --> 14:12.652
We gotta go up to the shack?

14:12.860 --> 14:13.611
Yeah.

14:20.412 --> 14:22.873
My God, this is a very heavy pack.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.380
Off to Coffin Rock.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.508
I know exactly where we are now.

14:31.551 --> 14:32.720
Mikey, give me the video camera.

14:32.928 --> 14:35.139
I wanna get her going across, man.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.939
I see a dirty behind.

14:45.111 --> 14:46.112
Good jump.

14:46.362 --> 14:46.947
Thank you.

14:47.030 --> 14:48.824
There it is. See?

14:51.077 --> 14:52.245
That's Coffin Rock.

14:56.918 --> 14:59.296
"They went into the woods
ready to find death...

14:59.463 --> 15:01.507
...but what they found
was inhumane...

15:01.716 --> 15:04.595
...at the site called Coffin Rock.

15:05.012 --> 15:07.390
...up on the rock, the torture...

15:08.016 --> 15:10.936
...suffered by these five
brave men was obvious...

15:11.103 --> 15:15.108
...they were tied up, one man's
hands tied to the next man's feet...

15:15.317 --> 15:17.278
...forming a solid
human structure...

15:17.445 --> 15:20.407
...blood indicated that
it had happened...

15:20.574 --> 15:23.328
...while they were
alive and resisting...

15:23.578 --> 15:26.999
...their intestines had been
crudely torn out...

15:27.333 --> 15:31.255
...and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing...

15:31.422 --> 15:33.549
...cut into their flesh
with precision...

15:33.841 --> 15:36.512
...the men, shocked by
what had happened...

15:36.720 --> 15:38.514
...went to find the sheriff...

15:38.723 --> 15:42.060
...without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies...

15:42.227 --> 15:44.272
...they returned to see
vultures at the rock.

15:44.480 --> 15:48.402
But the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown...

15:48.611 --> 15:51.573
...the stench of death
was still thick...

15:51.782 --> 15:55.203
...but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours... "

15:56.454 --> 15:59.876
That happened here
at Coffin Rock.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.383
Let's rush, because I want
to camp, and it's 4:52.

16:05.591 --> 16:08.512
It's late. We're gonna be
losing light soon.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.393
But I can use the shot
without me in it...

16:13.769 --> 16:17.774
...because I recorded sound
while reading the whole thing,...

16:18.316 --> 16:20.528
...so I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.285
It's starting to rain.

16:26.994 --> 16:27.996
Did you rent this thing?

16:28.246 --> 16:31.918
Yeah. I don't have a
tent for three people.

16:32.418 --> 16:33.503
Just wondering...

16:33.753 --> 16:35.798
I don't usually travel with two men.

16:36.215 --> 16:39.803
It is pouring with rain.
Can't even light a fire.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.264
Show us what the stick is for.

16:44.058 --> 16:47.313
Look. We've got our
very own leaning post.

16:47.813 --> 16:50.650
If it smells of farts
too much in the night...

16:51.026 --> 16:53.321
Okay, so I can't have a
cigarette in the tent,...

16:53.696 --> 16:55.740
...but he can fart as
much as he wants?

16:55.949 --> 16:59.621
No, I never gave Mike
a fart allowance.

17:00.455 --> 17:02.040
You heard noises last night?

17:02.166 --> 17:04.711
- I did.
- Problem is, I sleep like a log.

17:04.961 --> 17:07.339
There were two separate noises...

17:07.589 --> 17:10.468
...coming from two
areas over here...

17:11.303 --> 17:13.180
...one of them could
have been an owl...

17:13.388 --> 17:15.599
...but the other was a cackling.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.020
No way.

17:18.228 --> 17:19.814
It was a cackling, man.

17:20.064 --> 17:22.442
If I heard a cackling,
I would've shit myself.

17:23.068 --> 17:24.862
Where did we start yesterday?

17:25.154 --> 17:26.656
Off the map.

17:27.406 --> 17:31.245
I knew where we were going.
There was some confusion, but today...

17:31.454 --> 17:32.789
Wait,... say that again.

17:32.998 --> 17:35.209
I said I knew where
we were going.

17:35.459 --> 17:38.421
Wait,... was that a
full of shit statement?

17:38.588 --> 17:39.256
No, it wasn't.

17:39.464 --> 17:41.425
- So that wasn't bullshit?
- I knew where we were going.

17:41.592 --> 17:43.804
You got us lost, man.

17:43.970 --> 17:45.848
For a very short period of time.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.017
Just don't get us lost today.

17:48.184 --> 17:48.852
Yeah, seriously.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.854
No. These places are
very well documented.

17:51.063 --> 17:53.107
You happy with the documentary?

17:53.358 --> 17:54.276
Yes, I am.

17:55.277 --> 17:58.156
I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

17:58.364 --> 17:59.449
"Our Little Mikey?"

17:59.783 --> 18:01.034
Our Little Mikey...

18:04.414 --> 18:05.999
...a very spirited young man.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.212
What do you think about the
witch? You think she exists?

18:09.587 --> 18:11.214
I don't know.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.179
Heather, I really hope
you find us a trail.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.350
There's a trail up on
this hill. Don't worry.

18:21.728 --> 18:23.606
We like shortcuts, don't we?

18:25.942 --> 18:28.070
We like level shortcuts.

18:28.904 --> 18:30.782
Not mountain shortcuts.

18:31.116 --> 18:33.577
It's the first time we've
seen Mike's chest.

18:33.744 --> 18:36.039
It's really hard to film on video.

18:36.539 --> 18:39.084
He has really sporadic hair
patterns on his chest.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.169
Like symbols.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.881
It's like blank... hairy...

18:43.257 --> 18:44.967
...blank... hairy.

18:45.176 --> 18:46.094
You should see my ass.

18:46.344 --> 18:48.138
Look, here's fucking Uruguay.

18:49.765 --> 18:51.476
- And there's Paraguay.
- Yeah.

18:51.768 --> 18:53.144
I think I see Bolivia.

18:53.353 --> 18:57.108
What killed this
mouse? Witchcraft?

18:59.486 --> 19:00.821
How 'bout God?

19:02.031 --> 19:03.658
Is that the Blair Witch?

19:04.075 --> 19:08.456
No. I think it's Heather,
taking a piss.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.670
You know, I
really have to go.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.382
Ohhh... go!

19:16.508 --> 19:20.013
We're near the cemetery
trail. It should only be...

19:20.305 --> 19:22.099
- What?
- Says who?

19:22.308 --> 19:23.309
Says me, of course.

19:24.477 --> 19:28.065
We should be there
in about ninety minutes.

19:30.402 --> 19:31.653
You guys cool with that?

19:32.488 --> 19:33.155
What?

19:33.322 --> 19:34.407
Ninety minutes?

19:34.699 --> 19:37.244
- If you know where we're going.
- Sure.

19:37.536 --> 19:39.413
Josh wants to look at the map now.

19:39.622 --> 19:41.500
Though I know
where we're going.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.003
If you'd known where
we were, we wouldn't be...

19:44.211 --> 19:45.296
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods.

19:45.421 --> 19:48.050
- How could you possibly know?
- Because some is offtrail.

19:48.217 --> 19:50.887
What, somebody told you
there's a cemetery back there?

19:51.095 --> 19:53.557
If we're lost, admit that, because...

19:53.807 --> 19:54.976
...I know we're not lost.

19:55.184 --> 19:57.479
You knew that yesterday, too,
and twice again today.

19:57.646 --> 20:00.650
Bullshit! We have
not been lost today.

20:01.442 --> 20:02.819
Not once.

20:03.111 --> 20:04.029
Okay, this is where we were.

20:04.238 --> 20:06.783
You said that it was
two miles away.

20:06.950 --> 20:08.911
Then it's two hours away,
three hours away...

20:09.119 --> 20:11.664
- Okay, just chill!
- Maybe it's four hours away.

20:11.831 --> 20:14.668
- You agreed to do this project.
- I agreed to a scouted-out project.

20:14.835 --> 20:17.672
- Not to wander round the woods.
- I told you that...

20:17.881 --> 20:20.259
...getting to the locations
wasn't gonna be easy.

20:20.509 --> 20:22.303
Mike, Mike... Okay, guys!

20:22.470 --> 20:24.681
Please, you're being a smart-ass.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.141
We're looking at the map...

20:26.350 --> 20:28.895
...we'll find this the best we can.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.900
This is where we were. We're
going more or less this way.

20:33.693 --> 20:36.363
Okay, what do you say? Where
do you think we're going?

20:37.072 --> 20:38.324
To tell you the truth...

20:42.580 --> 20:45.417
...this is Greek
to me. It's useless.

20:45.584 --> 20:46.418
Exactly.

20:46.668 --> 20:48.212
So I'm putting my trust in you...

20:48.379 --> 20:51.341
...that you know where it is.

20:52.176 --> 20:53.093
Good.

20:54.345 --> 20:56.890
Though I gotta tell you,
I don't fully trust you...

20:58.017 --> 20:59.018
...and I...

20:59.727 --> 21:00.728
What?

21:01.021 --> 21:03.899
I don't know why you tape
every conversation, man.

21:04.066 --> 21:05.151
Well, we're making a documentary.

21:05.401 --> 21:08.489
Not about us getting lost,
it's about a witch!

21:09.865 --> 21:11.242
I have a camera.

21:11.868 --> 21:15.790
We'll all look back on this
and laugh, believe me.

21:16.332 --> 21:18.293
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

21:18.502 --> 21:21.756
Just breathe and don't look down.
No, you gotta look down.

21:21.923 --> 21:23.341
Are you gonna have to crawl?

21:23.508 --> 21:24.092
I'm gonna crawl.

21:24.259 --> 21:24.843
Cool.

21:25.010 --> 21:28.598
Think how cool the fucking
cemetery is gonna be.

21:30.768 --> 21:33.563
Think of the joy of being
in a really good film.

21:33.772 --> 21:34.606
Okay, shut the fuck up.

21:34.773 --> 21:36.025
Okay, I'm quiet.

21:36.192 --> 21:37.360
Shit. How am I gonna do this?

21:37.568 --> 21:39.696
Okay... Mikey?

21:39.905 --> 21:40.489
Yeah.

21:40.781 --> 21:44.453
Dude, don't come across
with the DAT on your belly.

21:44.745 --> 21:45.579
No way, man.

21:45.788 --> 21:47.039
There's no chance.

21:47.498 --> 21:49.292
How do we get it
across?

21:49.459 --> 21:50.377
It's really fucking hard.

21:50.544 --> 21:51.795
How we gonna get
it across?

21:51.962 --> 21:55.300
The moss this morning was easy.
This stuff's slippery as shit.

21:56.218 --> 21:57.929
Well, how do we get
the DAT across?

21:59.431 --> 22:02.518
I don't know. Let
me put my pack down...

22:02.726 --> 22:04.437
I'll just go back and forth, man.

22:04.646 --> 22:06.690
Can you do it that way?

22:06.940 --> 22:08.359
It's the only thing I can do.

22:08.567 --> 22:09.986
Okay, we'll do it like that.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.279
Oh, Christ!

22:11.488 --> 22:13.365
Oh, what'd you drop?

22:13.616 --> 22:17.371
Nothing.
The tree just broke.

22:17.579 --> 22:18.664
Oh, fuck.

22:18.873 --> 22:20.917
We're very, very close now.

22:23.545 --> 22:25.089
You guys excited?

22:27.884 --> 22:29.261
Okay.

22:29.929 --> 22:31.306
What's this?

22:38.815 --> 22:41.569
What's this? Dude, guys.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.825
Remember what Mary
Brown said the other day?

22:47.577 --> 22:50.289
What story from the
Bible was she telling us?

22:50.497 --> 22:52.792
Fuck, I wasn't listening, I
thought she was crazy.

22:53.335 --> 22:56.213
It was Esau, something about a
pile of rocks.

22:56.923 --> 22:59.551
She was talking
about her rocks, man.

22:59.801 --> 23:01.929
Well, what about
the rocks?

23:03.389 --> 23:05.183
Anybody remember?

23:06.435 --> 23:09.856
To live your life.

23:11.191 --> 23:13.486
Looks like an Indian
burial ground, man.

23:13.736 --> 23:15.697
I don't know if this counts,
three...

23:17.783 --> 23:18.701
...four...

23:21.246 --> 23:22.164
...five...

23:23.249 --> 23:24.250
...six...

23:25.710 --> 23:26.628
...seven.

23:26.879 --> 23:28.589
Years ago witches
were roasted...

23:28.798 --> 23:30.842
...just like my Vienna sausage.

23:31.468 --> 23:34.347
Flames are licking you
like the Devil, Josh.

23:34.555 --> 23:37.976
Sit back and hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip...

23:38.268 --> 23:40.480
...that started on
this desert isle...

23:40.688 --> 23:42.566
...aboard this tiny ship...

23:42.733 --> 23:44.860
Yeah, but this ship
has a good captain...

23:45.027 --> 23:47.405
...not a beer-guzzling
guy in a blue shirt.

23:47.739 --> 23:49.241
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

23:49.784 --> 23:51.828
They had no beer on
the island, man.

23:52.037 --> 23:54.999
If they had beer, they'd
have had big-ass orgies.

23:56.417 --> 23:59.588
You're like the Captain,
and Mike's your Gilligan.

24:00.089 --> 24:01.632
- No offense.
- That's all right.

24:01.925 --> 24:03.260
It was a compliment...

24:04.845 --> 24:06.347
...Gilligan was a funny guy...

24:06.639 --> 24:08.767
...the Captain was fat, though.

24:08.934 --> 24:11.228
Well okay, let's call
it a thin Captain.

24:11.479 --> 24:12.981
It's not Captain...

24:13.189 --> 24:15.651
It's the Skipper.

24:17.361 --> 24:18.530
No more Captain.

24:20.491 --> 24:23.161
Here we are back at
the rock again...

24:23.328 --> 24:25.038
...the cemetery deal.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.960
I just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot.

24:37.596 --> 24:39.223
It certainly is odd.

24:45.732 --> 24:48.652
Please tell me you didn't
just knock that over.

24:48.903 --> 24:50.447
I didn't just knock that over.

24:50.655 --> 24:54.702
That's not very nice.
Let me put it back.

25:03.046 --> 25:04.757
You can't be too careful.

25:05.174 --> 25:06.551
What'd you think?

25:07.594 --> 25:10.848
It was the same, only darker.

25:11.474 --> 25:13.101
Yeah, pretty much.

25:14.353 --> 25:16.898
All right. Bag it up.

25:17.691 --> 25:18.692
Hello?

25:20.236 --> 25:21.863
Shit, no light.

25:28.622 --> 25:30.207
We were sleeping.

25:30.416 --> 25:31.333
Do you want this?

25:32.460 --> 25:34.337
Put it by the tent door.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.482
Listen.

25:51.109 --> 25:52.111
Hello?

25:53.821 --> 25:54.823
Hello!

26:02.499 --> 26:06.087
It's all around us.
Fucking weird.

26:06.755 --> 26:08.632
Michael, aren't you
coming down?

26:09.050 --> 26:10.134
I ain't going down there.

26:10.426 --> 26:11.595
Why not?

26:11.803 --> 26:13.514
- Because I don't hear shit.
- You're fucking scared.

26:13.681 --> 26:14.849
Because I don't
hear anything!

26:15.057 --> 26:17.269
You cannot deny hearing it.

26:18.312 --> 26:20.189
Get your ass out! Come on!

26:22.567 --> 26:24.612
This rain fucking blows, man.

26:24.862 --> 26:26.823
I know. It's raining heavily.

26:27.449 --> 26:30.953
Thanks mom for giving me
rain gear for my birthday.

26:31.204 --> 26:32.789
God bless her.

26:33.039 --> 26:35.000
What do you think it
was last night?

26:36.377 --> 26:37.879
Personally?

26:38.004 --> 26:38.588
Yeah.

26:38.755 --> 26:40.966
Someone fucking
with your head.

26:41.175 --> 26:42.969
But nobody knows
we're here.

26:43.178 --> 26:45.639
Yeah, but... you ever see
"Deliverance"?

26:46.140 --> 26:49.645
Well, whatever it was,
I just wanted to...

26:49.811 --> 26:52.023
You were freaking out.
You bugged me out.

26:52.231 --> 26:55.235
I was. I woke up suddenly
and shit's going down...

26:55.402 --> 26:57.029
...and all I can think is
"I want it all...

26:57.238 --> 26:59.950
I want it on sound,
I want it on sixteen.

27:00.117 --> 27:02.870
If we see anything,
I want it on sixteen. "

27:03.329 --> 27:06.417
Sounded to me like a lot
of people running around...

27:06.625 --> 27:08.586
...maybe they were locals
or whatever.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.714
I don't know what
the hell they wanted.

27:10.922 --> 27:14.969
We're deep in the woods, and
if people want to mess with us...

27:15.136 --> 27:17.181
...then there's something
wrong with them...

27:17.389 --> 27:18.808
...and I'm not gonna
get into that.

27:18.975 --> 27:20.143
And if it wasn't people?

27:20.351 --> 27:22.229
Well, I'm not gonna
get into that, either!

27:23.814 --> 27:24.816
Fuck, man...

27:26.818 --> 27:28.612
... it's been a very long day...

27:28.779 --> 27:31.616
...a very wet, very long day.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.041
Nobody's speaking to me
right now.

27:38.625 --> 27:41.254
Dude, I don't remember
any of this.

27:42.130 --> 27:43.298
What?

27:43.465 --> 27:46.219
I don't remember any
of this coming from the car.

27:46.386 --> 27:50.224
We have to go a different
route to get back...

27:50.474 --> 27:52.519
...because we went
around in a curve.

27:54.980 --> 27:57.191
Two more hours max, guys.

27:59.278 --> 28:03.199
If we came by a short cut, why
are we going back a different way?

28:04.993 --> 28:07.038
Because we have to go round...

28:07.664 --> 28:10.125
It was the most direct way to
hit our two locations.

28:10.584 --> 28:12.295
And this is the quickest
way back to the car.

28:12.503 --> 28:13.421
Seriously?

28:13.630 --> 28:15.048
Yes. Seriously.

28:15.215 --> 28:18.094
- You know exactly what's going on?
- Yes. Let's just keep going.

28:18.302 --> 28:19.387
All right.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.558
Five minutes and we
do a map check.

28:23.017 --> 28:24.102
All right.

28:24.853 --> 28:28.691
We just did a map check,
and we're still on track.

28:29.526 --> 28:31.028
That's not what I said.

28:31.862 --> 28:34.157
We're all right. Come on,
just keep going.

28:37.745 --> 28:39.872
Well the compass says...

28:40.123 --> 28:42.334
...we go straight ahead,
that way.

28:43.043 --> 28:45.171
We're in the middle of nowhere.

28:45.547 --> 28:48.092
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

28:48.258 --> 28:49.969
Just like the car.

28:50.136 --> 28:52.806
Look at this shit, man!
This is nothing.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.227
Let's just keep
going, all right?

28:59.231 --> 29:00.691
I think we should camp.

29:00.858 --> 29:01.943
Get the fuck out of here!

29:02.152 --> 29:04.196
Why? 'Cause you don't know
where we are?

29:04.363 --> 29:06.407
No, because we're still
A little way from the car...

29:06.616 --> 29:07.951
...and it's gonna be dark soon.

29:09.369 --> 29:12.707
- Look, I'm not sure...
- We don't camp. Stop the camera...

29:12.874 --> 29:13.959
...and get us home.

29:14.126 --> 29:17.547
Turn the camera off and give
me the fucking map.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.216
Turn it off and get us home.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.553
No, I'm filming. I want
to mark this occasion.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.763
Give me the map.

29:23.972 --> 29:26.892
The map is in my
pocket. Wait a second.

29:27.059 --> 29:28.311
God damn!

29:28.770 --> 29:32.108
If we keep our heads
together, we'll be just fine.

29:32.275 --> 29:33.776
Fucking bullshit!

29:33.943 --> 29:35.028
Mike, chill.

29:35.529 --> 29:36.780
Just relax, Mike.

29:37.031 --> 29:39.075
Don't fucking tell
me to relax!

29:39.617 --> 29:42.705
Let's just sit down,
and check the map...

29:42.872 --> 29:44.916
Yes. Let's do that, please.

29:46.293 --> 29:47.628
Are you happy?

29:47.795 --> 29:49.172
I'm not happy, no.

29:49.964 --> 29:52.968
But the car isn't far. But we
can't find it in the dark.

29:53.177 --> 29:55.931
Are you absolutely sure?

29:56.139 --> 29:59.978
Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

30:00.103 --> 30:01.354
We have to...

30:01.563 --> 30:04.901
We will get the
DAT back on time.

30:05.109 --> 30:06.528
And the camera.

30:06.695 --> 30:08.155
We'll get it all
back tomorrow.

30:08.322 --> 30:10.700
I start work tomorrow at nine.

30:10.909 --> 30:11.910
I know.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.121
It's fine. Let's go to sleep.

30:14.288 --> 30:16.416
Let's just fucking camp, okay?

30:16.875 --> 30:19.002
I wanna tape it from
inside the tent.

30:24.802 --> 30:27.764
Whatever it is, it sounds the
same as last night.

30:35.190 --> 30:38.027
Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold...

30:42.992 --> 30:43.910
Hello?

30:47.915 --> 30:50.752
Shit, it's fucking freezing...

30:51.962 --> 30:52.964
...there.

30:54.174 --> 30:55.091
What?

30:55.300 --> 30:56.385
I hear it.

30:57.011 --> 30:58.429
I don't hear shit.

30:59.514 --> 31:00.891
You hear that?

31:07.149 --> 31:08.067
Shit...

31:18.455 --> 31:19.540
Hello?

31:49.371 --> 31:51.582
I think it's just a deer.

31:52.625 --> 31:55.170
- Could be deer, I guess.
- It's just a deer.

31:55.421 --> 31:56.964
I don't think so, man.

31:57.089 --> 32:00.260
Sounds just like last night.
It's all around us.

32:00.469 --> 32:01.721
It's gotta be just a deer.

32:01.929 --> 32:03.306
It was a deer, man.

32:04.349 --> 32:05.893
It wasn't like last night.

32:12.151 --> 32:13.069
You say something?

32:13.236 --> 32:16.824
Yes! Fucking listen! Let's
get it on DAT... be quiet...

32:17.032 --> 32:18.451
Okay, it's on.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.959
Jesus Christ! What the
fuck was that?

32:32.010 --> 32:34.055
It's not scared by our yelling.

32:39.103 --> 32:40.814
Sounds like footsteps.

32:41.022 --> 32:43.066
I know! It's a fucking person!

32:44.735 --> 32:47.906
I don't see shit on video.
We'll just use DAT, right?

32:48.115 --> 32:48.949
But I'm staying out.

32:49.116 --> 32:50.493
You stay out here with me.

32:50.660 --> 32:51.745
I am. I am.

32:52.078 --> 32:56.000
What time is it? Anywhere
near morning?

32:56.960 --> 32:57.627
Let me see...

32:57.836 --> 33:00.381
Tell me it's five
O'clock or something.

33:01.883 --> 33:02.634
Three.

33:02.801 --> 33:03.635
Fuck!

33:05.137 --> 33:08.308
Bullshit. This is
fucking crazy.

33:10.185 --> 33:12.730
I'm sorry, Mike. We should
be home already.

33:12.939 --> 33:14.983
This has got nothing to do...

33:16.068 --> 33:17.862
...with what we're here for.

33:18.071 --> 33:19.948
This is just it's bullshit.

33:20.908 --> 33:23.870
Woke up this morning,
two seconds ago...

33:24.538 --> 33:27.208
...and there are piles of
rocks outside our tent.

33:31.046 --> 33:32.840
There are three, actually.

33:34.509 --> 33:37.471
Are you positive those
weren't there last night?

33:37.680 --> 33:40.559
I am fucking positive
they weren't here!

33:40.809 --> 33:43.187
How could we have
just camped...

33:43.354 --> 33:46.692
...between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence?

33:47.484 --> 33:49.111
You don't think this is strange?

33:49.696 --> 33:53.200
It is fucking weird, but
I really don't care...

33:53.409 --> 33:55.954
...because all I want to do
is get to the goddam car.

33:56.162 --> 33:59.250
Whatever it is,
man, right now...

33:59.625 --> 34:01.419
...we have to get back to the car.

34:01.628 --> 34:04.507
They obviously don't want us
Here, so let's get out.

34:04.966 --> 34:07.177
We have to get the DAT back.

34:07.385 --> 34:09.764
- That's what I mean.
- Okay, let's go.

34:09.929 --> 34:12.851
Let's pack our shit up
and just walk.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.268
Can we just walk?

34:14.478 --> 34:15.396
Yes, we're out of here.

34:15.605 --> 34:16.438
Okay, cool.

34:16.856 --> 34:19.568
But we're leaving just
when it's all happening.

34:21.152 --> 34:23.824
Put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

34:23.991 --> 34:26.202
- Let's get out of the woods.
- Okay, hang on.

34:27.078 --> 34:27.829
Come on!

34:27.996 --> 34:31.000
No, I'm not scared!
I'm just tired and hungry...

34:31.167 --> 34:34.337
I'm just fucking done, man.

34:34.545 --> 34:35.464
All right.

34:38.426 --> 34:39.678
Did you take it?

34:40.387 --> 34:42.849
No, I didn't take the fucking map.

34:46.478 --> 34:48.105
I'm not playing head games.

34:48.398 --> 34:50.442
You're the one playing
head games.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.069
But I'm not.

34:53.737 --> 34:57.827
I don't have it. We have to go.
I'm serious, I don't have it.

34:58.035 --> 34:59.036
Are you fucking serious?

34:59.203 --> 35:01.248
Fucking serious. I don't have it.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.544
Heather, that is not so cool, man.

35:04.752 --> 35:06.463
I know it's not cool!

35:08.007 --> 35:09.467
It's the fucking least
responsible thing...

35:09.884 --> 35:12.095
...you could have done, man.

35:13.097 --> 35:14.014
I know that.

35:16.309 --> 35:17.936
You really don't have it?

35:19.855 --> 35:21.483
One of you must have the map.

35:21.691 --> 35:24.069
No, I don't have the map.
We gave it back to you...

35:24.361 --> 35:26.322
...after map check yesterday.

35:27.157 --> 35:29.451
I always keep it in the
same place...

35:29.660 --> 35:31.621
...and if it's not there,
one of you must have it.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.084
I did not get the goddam map
out of your fucking pants, man.

35:35.459 --> 35:37.337
Well, I don't have it!

35:37.504 --> 35:38.839
Look, why would I take it?

35:39.006 --> 35:41.384
I just wanna get out
of here, man.

35:41.634 --> 35:42.552
Me too.

35:42.844 --> 35:43.595
Let's go!

35:43.762 --> 35:47.183
No, you wanna stay and
film rocks, look around...

35:47.350 --> 35:48.017
Let's go!

35:48.184 --> 35:50.396
...you wanna film this and that...
Which way?

35:50.562 --> 35:51.230
That way.

35:51.439 --> 35:53.233
We're in the
middle of the woods!

35:53.399 --> 35:55.694
We can walk any way!

35:55.903 --> 35:59.157
This way! Because we've
been going this way all day.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.161
We're going this way!
We gotta find something!

36:02.745 --> 36:04.372
I gave you back the map!

36:04.581 --> 36:05.248
I gave you the map.

36:05.457 --> 36:07.668
I gave you back the map!

36:08.795 --> 36:11.089
- Let's just go.
- We can move as fast as we want...

36:11.298 --> 36:14.093
...but there's no point if we have
no idea where we're going.

36:14.385 --> 36:16.597
We're following the creek.
Mike seems happy with that.

36:16.763 --> 36:18.015
Would you guys stop it?

36:25.817 --> 36:28.028
We are fucked, we are done...

36:28.237 --> 36:30.615
...we are dead, we are fucked.

36:34.453 --> 36:38.584
I'm staying here. When you
find someone...

36:39.043 --> 36:42.047
...tell them I'm under the
tree with the vine.

36:42.255 --> 36:43.757
All blame aside...

36:46.719 --> 36:48.347
...this is really fucked up.

36:48.513 --> 36:50.892
I know.

36:51.517 --> 36:53.812
We really need to work together.

36:54.021 --> 36:56.148
- I realize that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

36:56.357 --> 36:59.528
So we accept the fact that my
camera's not gonna be back...

36:59.695 --> 37:00.946
...or your DAT.

37:01.238 --> 37:03.783
No blame from now
on about that shit.

37:04.159 --> 37:04.993
Look, seriously...

37:05.703 --> 37:08.456
...this area's not that fucking big.

37:08.748 --> 37:12.503
Exactly. It's very hard to get
lost in America these days...

37:12.795 --> 37:15.716
...and even harder to stay lost.

37:16.050 --> 37:16.801
What?

37:17.677 --> 37:20.138
Well, we're doin' a pretty good
job of being lost.

37:20.555 --> 37:24.144
If you're not home today,
and I'm not home today...

37:24.352 --> 37:25.979
...people are gonna notice...

37:26.146 --> 37:29.025
...My girlfriend's definitely
gonna notice...

37:29.526 --> 37:32.279
...and she'll notice that
I haven't called.

37:34.407 --> 37:37.244
...that I didn't get back and
I didn't call...

37:37.411 --> 37:39.121
...so if by tonight we
haven't found shit...

37:39.288 --> 37:42.000
...someone's gonna be looking for us.

37:42.167 --> 37:43.085
Oh, no!

37:43.252 --> 37:45.046
Not down here, go another way...

37:45.255 --> 37:47.382
...I just got my whole shit wet.

37:50.887 --> 37:53.891
Shit. Well, let's try it this way.

37:55.101 --> 37:56.561
No, not this way...

37:57.729 --> 37:59.857
...better try the other way.

38:02.193 --> 38:05.281
- If we didn't have these packs...
- I don't mean to laugh...

38:06.240 --> 38:07.575
Your feet are wet!

38:07.742 --> 38:09.453
Is Michael laughing?

38:12.749 --> 38:14.793
Shut up and cross the stream.

38:15.628 --> 38:16.712
He's laughing...

38:16.879 --> 38:19.842
...that's the first time
you've laughed in days.

38:24.306 --> 38:27.310
I'm happy you
find it amusing...

38:27.518 --> 38:29.813
...that I'll be uncomfortable
for the rest of the day.

38:30.606 --> 38:32.733
Dude, uncomfort does not even...

38:33.860 --> 38:35.028
Can we keep going, please?

38:35.404 --> 38:37.531
No, we're gonna chill out!

38:39.284 --> 38:42.371
- Didn't you want to get to the car?
- Oh boy!!

38:42.830 --> 38:44.415
Okay, come on... let's get up here.

38:44.582 --> 38:45.667
Oh shit.

38:46.668 --> 38:49.422
You weren't lying to me about
the map, were you?

38:49.631 --> 38:53.469
'Cause to me it seems like you're
having a little too much fun.

38:53.719 --> 38:55.513
- Oh, Heather...
- We're going a little stir crazy.

38:55.847 --> 38:58.851
Heather! If you make me
yell at this point...

38:59.268 --> 39:00.895
...don't make me
yell at you, man.

39:01.146 --> 39:04.650
Seriously, if you got the map, I
just wanna know you have it!

39:05.485 --> 39:08.238
That would make me happy,
just to know you have it.

39:09.490 --> 39:13.412
If I knew that, and I could see
it, I'd feel much better.

39:17.584 --> 39:19.461
We're just trying to
be cool with you.

39:19.628 --> 39:23.049
So I get laughed at 'cause
my shoes got wet.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.635
It's fucking hilarious.

39:28.849 --> 39:30.726
All our shoes are wet...

39:30.893 --> 39:33.355
...we were laughing
at the situation.

39:33.605 --> 39:34.273
Fine.

39:34.481 --> 39:36.442
We're fucking hungry
and fucking tired...

39:36.609 --> 39:39.404
- ...what the hell else can we do?
- You know what?

39:39.571 --> 39:42.033
I'm sorry, it's fucked up...

39:44.369 --> 39:48.041
...but I kicked that map into the
creek yesterday.

39:48.541 --> 39:52.213
It was useless and I kicked it
into the creek!

39:56.510 --> 39:58.137
I fucking hope he's kidding.

39:59.639 --> 40:00.474
Mike?

40:02.059 --> 40:03.686
I really fucking hope he's kidding.

40:05.522 --> 40:06.899
Mike, are you fucking kidding?

40:07.066 --> 40:08.776
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

40:08.985 --> 40:12.406
You're kidding me. You have
gotta be fucking kidding me!

40:12.907 --> 40:14.534
- You think it's a game?
- Get off me!

40:14.701 --> 40:16.745
What the fuck?
Are you out of your mind?

40:16.954 --> 40:19.332
No, I'm not. That map
wasn't doing shit!

40:19.540 --> 40:22.795
Not for you, but I knew what
the fuck the map said!!

40:23.003 --> 40:23.838
I'm sorry!

40:24.046 --> 40:25.840
You're a fucking asshole!

40:26.091 --> 40:26.925
I'm sorry.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.469
You're a fucking asshole!

40:28.761 --> 40:30.972
That map was useless!

40:31.181 --> 40:33.976
If we get hurt or die here,
it's your fucking fault!

40:34.226 --> 40:36.521
You understand?

40:39.024 --> 40:41.486
How could you be
such an asshole?

40:42.696 --> 40:46.117
- What were you thinking?
- You are fucking me up here!

40:46.409 --> 40:49.288
I am not! That map
was useless!

40:50.164 --> 40:51.582
It was useless to you!

40:52.292 --> 40:55.003
Okay...

40:55.379 --> 40:57.590
I didn't bring you out
here for this, man.

40:58.049 --> 41:01.303
Sorry about the map, man.
What can I say?

41:01.595 --> 41:05.517
- The map wasn't doing shit.
- Just don't say sorry.

41:05.768 --> 41:07.228
It wasn't worth
shit to you.

41:07.395 --> 41:10.357
I knew exactly where
we were!

41:10.524 --> 41:13.403
Listen! Yesterday I asked you what
fucking river we were on...

41:13.611 --> 41:14.863
Shut up or else.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.615
Turn the fucking camera off!

41:16.782 --> 41:17.867
Give me the compass...

41:19.577 --> 41:21.622
...you have betrayed us...

41:21.914 --> 41:25.085
...way fucking beyond.
Give me the compass.

41:25.710 --> 41:27.671
So have you for not getting
us out of the woods.

41:27.838 --> 41:29.090
Yeah, thanks.

41:30.508 --> 41:32.469
Can I have the fucking compass?

41:33.262 --> 41:36.933
No. I bought the compass.
If you wanted one...

41:37.142 --> 41:38.644
...you should've
bought your own.

41:38.853 --> 41:40.647
You and he both fucked us up.

41:40.939 --> 41:42.566
Why can't you admit that...

41:42.900 --> 41:45.194
- ...you fucked up from the start.
- Let's just walk south.

41:45.403 --> 41:46.571
Because I haven't!

41:47.155 --> 41:48.490
Why are we stopped?

41:53.956 --> 41:55.041
Why are we stopped?

41:58.003 --> 41:59.171
Just don't.

41:59.505 --> 42:02.509
I'm just asking
Why we stopped.

42:04.636 --> 42:07.098
Weren't we going south?

42:07.307 --> 42:09.184
We all seemed very
Happy with that.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.854
Why don't we carry on like that?

42:21.367 --> 42:22.201
What?

42:22.493 --> 42:24.538
There's all sorts of
Stuff down here!

42:24.746 --> 42:25.998
What kind of stuff?

42:26.498 --> 42:27.875
Voodoo shit!

42:29.711 --> 42:30.963
What?

42:31.171 --> 42:34.175
- Hanging all over the place!
- No way...

42:35.969 --> 42:37.304
It's all over.

42:37.471 --> 42:38.389
Holy shit...

42:40.559 --> 42:43.020
Come up quick! I need the CP!

42:43.229 --> 42:44.939
There's all sorts
Here, man!

42:45.899 --> 42:48.277
This is fucking crazy shit.

42:51.573 --> 42:53.284
Please, I gotta film this!

42:53.534 --> 42:54.702
Take the fucking camera.

42:58.707 --> 42:59.709
What the fuck is this?

42:59.917 --> 43:01.169
I have no idea.

43:44.059 --> 43:47.730
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

43:51.652 --> 43:54.823
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

43:57.076 --> 43:58.160
Can we go now?

43:58.327 --> 43:59.746
Yeah, please.

44:00.538 --> 44:03.000
Okay, I got everything on video.

44:03.209 --> 44:05.962
Oh, Jesus Christ, I didn't
Even see these!

44:06.755 --> 44:09.425
Okay, Heather, you got
Enough, man. Let's go.

44:09.759 --> 44:13.180
- That's enough! Stop taping!
- That's enough!

44:13.430 --> 44:16.226
- Okay, we're going right now.
- Let's go!

44:16.476 --> 44:20.148
Okay, we're out of here.
I'm leaving.

44:21.357 --> 44:22.776
Come on, turn it off!

44:22.943 --> 44:26.114
Help!

44:28.158 --> 44:30.119
Please help us!

44:32.622 --> 44:34.750
We won't get out of here like that.

44:35.042 --> 44:35.960
Fuck!

44:36.753 --> 44:38.004
Fuck!

44:38.755 --> 44:42.176
I think I can say
that we're now lost.

44:43.136 --> 44:44.680
I don't know what to do.

44:46.057 --> 44:48.268
We should all get
Inside the tent.

44:48.602 --> 44:49.519
All right.

44:49.811 --> 44:51.772
Let's not light a fire tonight.

44:52.231 --> 44:53.483
Yeah, that's my thinking.

44:53.692 --> 44:56.862
- That's a good idea.
- We didn't light one the first night.

44:57.071 --> 44:57.905
And nothing happened.

44:58.072 --> 45:01.076
We light fires, and they know.
No one was following us.

45:01.493 --> 45:02.912
We should turn that light off, too.

45:03.121 --> 45:04.205
All right.

45:04.414 --> 45:07.168
Seriously, anything
could attract them.

45:08.711 --> 45:10.046
Let's just go to sleep.

45:24.357 --> 45:25.608
Oh God.

45:30.239 --> 45:31.575
Put this out.

45:54.104 --> 45:57.275
Jesus Christ, little kids. Oh, God!

45:57.567 --> 45:58.986
I'm gonna put my jeans on.

45:59.152 --> 46:02.031
Take the video camera.
No, the DAT.

46:02.699 --> 46:04.660
I'm gonna get this on video.

46:04.868 --> 46:06.495
Oh, dear God, dear God!

46:19.429 --> 46:20.931
Go, fucking go!

46:22.057 --> 46:22.892
Oh God!

46:24.102 --> 46:25.353
Oh God!

46:27.773 --> 46:28.775
Hurry up!

46:28.983 --> 46:31.862
I'm coming! My boots aren't laced!

46:32.988 --> 46:34.949
Oh my God, what the fuck is that?

46:35.909 --> 46:37.536
What the fuck is that?

46:45.004 --> 46:46.089
Oh, shit!

46:53.641 --> 46:55.935
Mike, where are you, man?

47:05.489 --> 47:06.991
Turn the lights off...

47:07.617 --> 47:09.995
...turn that light off.
turn it off, Josh.

47:12.707 --> 47:15.961
All lights off,
all lights off.

47:23.346 --> 47:24.598
I'm soaking.

47:24.681 --> 47:25.849
That's okay.

47:26.434 --> 47:27.685
What was that?

47:28.561 --> 47:30.689
What the fuck is going on?

47:36.614 --> 47:38.992
You hear that baby screaming?

47:39.284 --> 47:41.745
Shut the fuck up. There's
no fucking baby.

47:41.996 --> 47:44.916
- Yes there was.
- There was no fucking baby.

47:48.462 --> 47:50.757
I haven't heard anything
since we ran away...

47:53.594 --> 47:55.054
Oh my God, it's cold.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.100
We should be quiet, okay?

48:07.696 --> 48:10.324
I don't hear anything anymore.
Let's go back.

48:13.537 --> 48:15.248
How long have we been here?

48:15.540 --> 48:17.167
I don't know, man, an hour...?

48:19.336 --> 48:21.464
The sun's up. We're okay now.

48:23.634 --> 48:25.678
Let's just get back,
pack up, and go.

48:25.845 --> 48:27.096
Okay.

48:29.850 --> 48:31.644
What the fuck, man?

48:32.270 --> 48:33.772
Where's my pack?

48:33.939 --> 48:35.816
Right there. Where's mine?

48:36.317 --> 48:37.944
What the fuck, man?

48:45.537 --> 48:47.415
Why're they fucking
with us like this?

48:48.333 --> 48:49.876
They just opened it up.

48:50.252 --> 48:52.046
They spilled all my water!

48:52.380 --> 48:53.923
Looks like slime, man.

48:54.799 --> 48:55.968
It's just water, man.

48:56.635 --> 48:59.013
It is slime. What the fuck is it?

48:59.431 --> 49:00.891
Let's get out of here.

49:01.058 --> 49:02.518
- Heather, turn that thing off!
- Let's go.

49:02.727 --> 49:03.561
Okay.

49:03.770 --> 49:05.730
I'm not interested
anymore! Let's go!

49:06.023 --> 49:06.857
I know.

49:07.024 --> 49:08.275
So turn it off.

49:08.860 --> 49:11.405
Relax. Have we got everything here?

49:12.489 --> 49:14.534
- Like I give a shit.
- Whose bag was opened?

49:14.742 --> 49:15.911
It was mine!

49:19.165 --> 49:20.500
Why you?

49:20.875 --> 49:22.836
Are you not scared enough yet?

49:23.003 --> 49:23.754
But why you?

49:24.297 --> 49:26.091
Put it down. This is not funny.

49:26.299 --> 49:28.761
Am I laughing at all?

49:29.053 --> 49:32.224
No, but you're still doing
your documentary thing, man!

49:32.432 --> 49:33.851
Still your fucking documentary!

49:34.101 --> 49:36.855
- Don't touch it!
- Then turn the goddam thing off!

49:37.063 --> 49:39.733
If you bite me again,
I'll throw you in river.

49:40.067 --> 49:43.238
- Don't touch my camera.
- Turn it off!

49:43.530 --> 49:44.364
I'm sorry.

49:44.531 --> 49:46.033
I didn't mean it, okay?

49:46.200 --> 49:47.118
You all right?

49:47.285 --> 49:48.912
Yeah. I wanna go home...

49:49.121 --> 49:50.998
...but I wanna get
what we can.

49:51.624 --> 49:52.625
What the fuck...?

49:54.920 --> 49:56.339
Is this possible?

49:57.256 --> 49:58.884
All right.

49:59.927 --> 50:00.928
Here I go.

50:01.220 --> 50:03.598
I hate crossing streams on logs.

50:04.349 --> 50:05.976
If I never cross another stream...

50:06.227 --> 50:08.980
...on a log, I'll die happy.

50:11.358 --> 50:14.446
I see why you like the
video camera so much.

50:15.739 --> 50:16.824
You do?

50:17.074 --> 50:18.868
It's not quite reality.

50:21.663 --> 50:23.541
Reality says we gotta move.

50:24.834 --> 50:27.922
But it's a totally filtered
reality, man.

50:29.465 --> 50:32.970
As if everything's
not quite the way it is.

50:36.266 --> 50:37.810
Just leave him alone awhile

50:38.060 --> 50:39.145
We need to go.

50:39.353 --> 50:40.772
Leave him for five minutes.

50:41.690 --> 50:44.568
Leave him alone. Five minutes.

50:44.986 --> 50:46.488
Come on, he's lost it.

50:47.739 --> 50:50.117
I know, but we've all
nearly lost it.

50:50.326 --> 50:53.330
I know, but we got
to look after each other.

50:53.664 --> 50:55.625
And we're not looking after him...

50:55.792 --> 50:57.836
...if we film him
while he's crying.

50:58.044 --> 50:58.795
I know.

50:58.962 --> 51:00.339
I know you know.

51:00.464 --> 51:03.009
Let's try and keep our wits.

51:03.218 --> 51:04.553
But we have to go.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.098
Sure. Believe me, I know.

51:07.265 --> 51:08.975
It's hard to stay calm.

51:09.142 --> 51:11.270
- We need to get out.
- I know.

51:11.479 --> 51:12.939
You're not telling me
anything new,

51:13.732 --> 51:15.776
Just let him calm down.

51:15.985 --> 51:17.361
Anybody got a cigarette?

51:17.528 --> 51:18.363
No, man.

51:18.571 --> 51:19.906
No, there's none left.

51:20.741 --> 51:22.702
Nobody has any cigarettes?

51:22.869 --> 51:23.953
We're out.

51:26.999 --> 51:28.793
Why the fuck...

51:29.085 --> 51:31.797
...was this blue jelly
shit on my shit?

51:32.047 --> 51:33.132
Let's go.

51:33.925 --> 51:35.010
Let's go.

51:35.719 --> 51:38.264
If we keep going south,
we'll get out.

51:39.390 --> 51:40.392
Please...

51:41.894 --> 51:44.522
I don't wanna camp
another fucking night.

51:44.731 --> 51:47.109
Josh, none of us do.

51:47.317 --> 51:48.235
I know you don't.

51:48.444 --> 51:51.698
Whoever it is, is gonna come
back, and that's a fact.

51:51.990 --> 51:53.075
It's not a fact.

51:53.325 --> 51:56.246
It came three nights running,
and it's worse every night.

51:56.413 --> 51:59.041
Just what I need to
hear right now.

51:59.208 --> 52:02.713
I'm just trying to
rationally say that...

52:03.297 --> 52:07.427
...with our walking speed,
they might just go on forever...

52:08.262 --> 52:11.683
Not possible in this country.

52:12.392 --> 52:13.310
Why not?

52:13.477 --> 52:17.148
Because we've destroyed most
of our woods in America.

52:17.315 --> 52:20.653
- Let's just keep going.
- America, America...

52:21.028 --> 52:24.449
...God shed your grace on thee...

52:27.537 --> 52:31.542
...Once so proudly we hailed...

52:32.460 --> 52:35.798
...at twilight's last gleaming...

52:38.218 --> 52:39.845
That's the tree we crossed.

52:40.053 --> 52:42.098
That tree is down. Same one.

52:44.768 --> 52:46.228
Oh God!

52:47.062 --> 52:47.813
Oh no...

52:47.980 --> 52:50.692
You got to be kidding,
this is a joke!

52:52.278 --> 52:54.322
It's not funny!

52:54.948 --> 52:58.452
Mike, please stop...
please stop...

53:02.416 --> 53:03.876
Oh no!

53:04.627 --> 53:06.588
No, Mike, it's not the same log!

53:09.425 --> 53:11.303
- Same log!
- Look, it's not!

53:11.470 --> 53:13.347
Yes it is! Open your eyes!

53:13.597 --> 53:15.558
It's not the same log...

53:33.916 --> 53:35.459
It's the same log.

53:36.169 --> 53:38.630
Fuck you, God!!

53:39.214 --> 53:41.259
It's the same log.

53:48.560 --> 53:51.230
Okay, it's okay.

53:56.904 --> 53:59.115
Where do you wanna camp?

53:59.366 --> 54:01.994
Going south didn't work.
Tomorrow we go east.

54:02.203 --> 54:04.247
I don't know what to say, Josh.

54:05.457 --> 54:08.002
How the fuck did we wind
up in the same place?

54:08.211 --> 54:12.258
We walked south
all fucking day!

54:12.466 --> 54:14.511
I don't know how we
ended up here!

54:21.395 --> 54:23.773
Do you expect me to do,
or say something?

54:33.035 --> 54:34.453
What do you wanna do?

54:40.837 --> 54:42.088
Josh?

54:46.928 --> 54:48.972
I wanna make movies, Heather.

54:51.684 --> 54:53.395
Isn't that why we came?

54:55.564 --> 54:57.358
Let's make some movies.

54:57.692 --> 54:59.152
Fuck you.

55:01.906 --> 55:03.408
Fuck you.

55:03.575 --> 55:05.703
Let's not fight, please?

55:06.871 --> 55:09.624
...I can't take it.
I can't fight.

55:09.833 --> 55:13.671
We're screwed, and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

55:14.715 --> 55:16.342
I'll do the first watch.

55:18.386 --> 55:20.097
I got first watch.

55:28.274 --> 55:30.151
It's not the time or place, guys.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.154
We have things to prepare for.

55:32.321 --> 55:34.032
Okay, here's your motivation...

55:34.324 --> 55:37.578
...you're lost, you're angry and
no one's here to help you...

55:37.870 --> 55:41.208
...there's a fucking witch who
keeps leaving shit around...

55:41.374 --> 55:42.835
...no one can help you...

55:43.043 --> 55:45.505
...she left little trinkets, and
you fucking took one...

55:45.755 --> 55:48.300
...she's chasing us. And
no one can help you!

55:48.467 --> 55:50.261
We walked fifteen hours today...

55:50.428 --> 55:52.639
...and we ended up in the same place!

55:52.848 --> 55:56.269
There's no one to help you!
That's your motivation!

56:00.233 --> 56:01.609
Please stop.

56:01.776 --> 56:05.197
Josh, quit it. She's had enough.

56:06.157 --> 56:08.368
You got her back. Good one.

56:08.535 --> 56:11.080
No, she's still making movies!

56:11.289 --> 56:13.250
- Please stop.
- Still making movies.

56:13.458 --> 56:16.337
It's all I have left, okay?
Just please stop.

56:18.882 --> 56:21.594
Please stop yelling at me.

56:26.934 --> 56:29.396
I'm fucking tired of
crying all day.

56:30.230 --> 56:33.318
We gotta think like human beings.
We got things to do.

56:33.526 --> 56:36.155
We've gotta do shifts.
We got lots to do.

56:42.288 --> 56:44.666
You gonna write us a
happy ending, Heather?

56:53.719 --> 56:55.347
Come on, turn it off.

56:56.306 --> 56:58.267
You're getting like she was.

57:03.733 --> 57:07.321
I don't know how you can
sew at this point, man,

57:07.487 --> 57:09.365
Well, I'm cold.

57:09.949 --> 57:11.910
- I know.
- I hear you.

57:12.202 --> 57:14.580
The smallest comforts
we can get are good.

57:14.789 --> 57:17.417
Doesn't it seem absurd,
though, at this point?

57:17.626 --> 57:18.710
Yes, it does.

57:18.877 --> 57:21.172
Lots of things seem absurd.

57:21.464 --> 57:24.969
Like sleeping where we were
last night is freaking...

57:25.136 --> 57:27.347
It's just fucking me up, period.

57:28.223 --> 57:31.561
Really fucking me up, man.

57:35.524 --> 57:38.612
- I'm sorry, man.
- Me too. It's all right.

57:38.904 --> 57:40.447
I'm sorry, Heather.

57:40.948 --> 57:42.200
It's all right.

57:42.659 --> 57:44.786
Who wants a cheeseburger?

57:45.454 --> 57:46.789
I do, I do...

57:47.707 --> 57:50.085
I got a cheeseburger in my pocket.

57:50.335 --> 57:53.840
Do you? Can I have a
light to cut this?

57:54.591 --> 57:56.135
Know what I'd fucking love?

57:56.552 --> 57:57.470
What?

57:57.678 --> 57:59.013
Mashed potatoes.

58:00.223 --> 58:01.391
Me too.

58:03.644 --> 58:06.523
My mom's mashed potatoes.

58:10.737 --> 58:13.115
You'll have them again very soon.

58:14.617 --> 58:17.788
Mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

58:19.499 --> 58:20.583
Josh?

58:24.422 --> 58:27.050
Fuck, we never go out of earshot!

58:28.302 --> 58:30.096
Come on, calm down.

58:31.556 --> 58:33.016
How can I?

58:42.654 --> 58:44.156
He's probably at the river.

58:44.323 --> 58:46.701
If he was there,
he could hear me.

58:51.582 --> 58:53.293
Wait for him to respond.

58:54.044 --> 58:56.088
Remember what he said yesterday?

58:56.464 --> 58:57.548
What?

58:59.259 --> 59:02.513
About the shit on his bag.

59:06.602 --> 59:10.357
Let's go. We've gotta find
him. Come on.

59:10.649 --> 59:14.404
If we can't even find the car,
how are we gonna find Josh?

59:14.613 --> 59:15.614
Come on.

59:15.864 --> 59:17.491
No, I'm fine.

59:18.576 --> 59:20.454
Come on, come on, relax.

59:20.662 --> 59:23.207
All right, let's take
down the tent...

59:23.750 --> 59:25.126
...and when he's back, we'll go.

59:25.460 --> 59:27.254
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

59:27.796 --> 59:29.132
Josh hasn't come back.

59:29.298 --> 59:30.049
Heather?

59:31.051 --> 59:32.594
I'm here, Mike.

59:36.016 --> 59:38.644
I don't know if Josh ran off.

59:40.146 --> 59:41.648
All his shit's here.

59:43.609 --> 59:44.861
I've got the camera...

59:46.029 --> 59:48.490
...I don't know how I'm
gonna hike with the camera.

59:49.158 --> 59:51.119
Sure you wanna take it?

59:51.286 --> 59:52.454
We have to take the camera.

59:54.290 --> 59:56.250
How do you feel about east?

59:58.253 --> 59:59.839
How do you feel about east?

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:03.844
Well, south didn't work.

01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:09.393
Which witch was worse, the one
from the east or from the south?

01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:13.982
The witch of the
west was the bad one.

01:00:14.524 --> 01:00:15.776
Let's go east.

01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:20.741
What the hell is that?

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.202
Josh?

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:30.212
We'll have to put up the tent.

01:00:42.394 --> 01:00:44.188
I'd like a meatball.

01:00:44.397 --> 01:00:45.857
Just one meatball?

01:00:46.066 --> 01:00:48.194
And a big glass of red wine.

01:00:48.361 --> 01:00:51.448
Yeah, I would like a whole
fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

01:00:51.823 --> 01:00:53.409
And a pack of smokes.

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:57.372
That'd be good.
and a long, hot bath.

01:00:57.539 --> 01:00:59.041
And a big pumpkin pie.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:01.044
A pumpkin pie with ice cream?

01:01:02.713 --> 01:01:04.757
Warm with milky ice cream?

01:01:04.966 --> 01:01:06.217
Yeah, sounds good.

01:01:06.676 --> 01:01:09.054
What do you like
to do on a Sunday?

01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:14.269
I used to like to drive to the
woods and go hiking.

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:19.902
But I think that might change now.

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:22.238
I think you could scratch that.

01:01:36.924 --> 01:01:38.384
Should we open the door?

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.263
Is it a trick?

01:01:50.943 --> 01:01:51.944
Josh!

01:01:53.821 --> 01:01:54.906
Josh!

01:02:07.214 --> 01:02:08.841
Where's it coming from?

01:02:23.193 --> 01:02:26.155
Josh, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

01:02:29.952 --> 01:02:32.914
Oh my God, no.

01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:41.425
Do you think that's them again?

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:49.394
Is it over here?

01:02:49.603 --> 01:02:51.313
No, it's over here.

01:03:01.994 --> 01:03:03.246
We'll look for him.

01:03:16.305 --> 01:03:19.642
I don't know if it's really him.

01:03:32.034 --> 01:03:34.161
I don't even know where to look.

01:03:39.084 --> 01:03:41.546
Tell me where you are, Josh!

01:03:44.759 --> 01:03:45.593
Mike?

01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:47.971
- What?
- Please don't fall asleep.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.598
I can't fall asleep.

01:03:53.478 --> 01:03:56.899
Whatever it is, it
knows Josh has gone.

01:04:02.448 --> 01:04:05.411
If that was Josh, he would've
said where he was.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.211
Whatever it was, it
sounded like Josh.

01:04:14.381 --> 01:04:15.299
See?

01:04:16.425 --> 01:04:19.220
I just want to show you
that Mike's here.

01:04:19.805 --> 01:04:21.265
There. He's sleeping.

01:04:29.317 --> 01:04:30.485
Oh, shit.

01:04:34.324 --> 01:04:35.742
What the hell is that?

01:04:39.455 --> 01:04:40.916
- Mike.
- What?

01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:44.504
There's something out here.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:54.183
Okay,

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.854
I'm gonna move it
from in front of the tent.

01:04:58.105 --> 01:04:59.982
- Get rid of it.
- Okay.

01:05:02.152 --> 01:05:05.406
I'm taking it away
from the tent.

01:05:06.366 --> 01:05:08.493
I'm just throwing it.

01:05:14.209 --> 01:05:16.963
We'll just keep walking, okay.

01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:18.256
Okay.

01:05:22.136 --> 01:05:26.142
I found some cigarettes
at the bottom of my pack...

01:05:26.308 --> 01:05:28.979
...so if we're smoking,
we're still alive.

01:06:19.461 --> 01:06:21.005
It's all full of blood.

01:07:01.141 --> 01:07:04.646
Shit, shit, shit!

01:07:10.987 --> 01:07:12.322
Oh my God!

01:07:26.049 --> 01:07:27.384
Okay, see...?

01:07:28.802 --> 01:07:29.720
Yeah?

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:32.432
What are you doing?

01:07:32.641 --> 01:07:34.685
Just washing my hands!

01:07:34.977 --> 01:07:35.645
What?

01:07:35.812 --> 01:07:37.355
Just washing my hands!

01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:39.316
I'm fine.

01:07:40.067 --> 01:07:41.611
I'm gonna put my gloves on.

01:07:51.374 --> 01:07:52.375
You all right?

01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:56.380
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:07:59.927 --> 01:08:01.011
You need help?

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:03.306
No, I don't need any help.

01:08:04.516 --> 01:08:05.601
I'm okay.

01:08:05.768 --> 01:08:06.435
What happened?

01:08:06.602 --> 01:08:09.940
Nothing. I'm just very
hungry and very tired...

01:08:10.607 --> 01:08:12.652
...and very scared, and I just
wanna go home, okay?

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.611
Okay.

01:08:13.778 --> 01:08:15.739
But I'm fine, and we're okay.

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:25.210
Ow! My hair's caught.

01:08:28.005 --> 01:08:30.759
Thank you, thank you.

01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:36.433
Okay, okay.

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:22.702
Two thousand one
hundred thirty games...

01:09:23.453 --> 01:09:25.997
...one more season and
Cal Ripken is king!

01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:32.548
And I won't see it...

01:09:33.675 --> 01:09:35.801
...because I'll be in the woods.

01:09:51.113 --> 01:09:54.452
Tell me you're not
eating a dry leaf.

01:10:05.591 --> 01:10:07.219
I just want to apologize...

01:10:08.846 --> 01:10:10.556
...to Mike's mom...

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.352
...and Josh's mom...

01:10:14.395 --> 01:10:16.022
...and my mom...

01:10:19.109 --> 01:10:21.487
...and I'm sorry to everyone...

01:10:23.865 --> 01:10:25.826
...I was very naïve.

01:10:30.249 --> 01:10:34.004
I am so, so, sorry...

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:36.966
...for everything that's happened...

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:41.180
...because in spite of
what Mike says now...

01:10:41.347 --> 01:10:42.598
...it was my fault...

01:10:44.309 --> 01:10:46.019
...because it was my project...

01:10:47.063 --> 01:10:48.690
...and I insisted...

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.194
...insisted on everything.

01:10:53.154 --> 01:10:55.949
I insisted we weren't lost...

01:10:57.284 --> 01:11:00.080
...I insisted we keep going...

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:03.459
...I insisted we walk south.

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:07.798
Everything had
to be my way.

01:11:08.132 --> 01:11:10.343
And this is how we've ended up.

01:11:11.636 --> 01:11:14.807
And it's all because of me
that we're here now...

01:11:15.141 --> 01:11:17.519
...hungry and cold...

01:11:19.814 --> 01:11:21.524
...and hunted.

01:11:26.698 --> 01:11:28.408
I love you, mom...

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:30.828
...dad...

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.543
...I am so sorry.

01:11:41.676 --> 01:11:43.261
...what was that?

01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.364
I'm scared to close my eyes...

01:11:59.282 --> 01:12:01.243
...and scared to open them.

01:12:08.503 --> 01:12:09.879
Oh God...

01:12:10.547 --> 01:12:12.341
...we're gonna die here.

01:12:16.722 --> 01:12:19.016
- You got it?
- You ready?

01:12:20.852 --> 01:12:22.479
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:12:33.869 --> 01:12:35.121
You ready?

01:12:35.288 --> 01:12:37.249
Here, take this light.

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.922
That can't be him.

01:13:22.183 --> 01:13:24.561
Holy shit, it's a house.

01:13:26.522 --> 01:13:29.693
- Watch your step.
- Holy shit, Holy shit...

01:13:50.845 --> 01:13:51.680
Josh?

01:14:06.032 --> 01:14:08.869
Mike. Mike.

01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:11.456
Come on.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.168
Mike, where the fuck are you?

01:14:14.376 --> 01:14:16.337
Come on, I'm in the house!

01:14:16.838 --> 01:14:19.383
Mike, don't go in there, please!

01:14:38.157 --> 01:14:41.745
Mike, please!
Mike, where are you?

01:14:41.954 --> 01:14:43.039
I'm right here!

01:14:50.215 --> 01:14:51.383
Where is he?

01:14:51.675 --> 01:14:53.469
Mike, please don't.

01:15:02.648 --> 01:15:03.983
Is he in here?

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:05.068
No.

01:15:19.587 --> 01:15:20.838
Oh, Jesus.

01:15:21.089 --> 01:15:22.257
Where is he?

01:15:23.675 --> 01:15:25.303
Are you gonna go upstairs?

01:15:27.263 --> 01:15:29.391
I hear him. I hear him.

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:31.769
I hear you. Josh!

01:15:40.197 --> 01:15:41.908
I'm going upstairs.

01:15:45.412 --> 01:15:48.583
Oh, God, oh.

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:54.341
Hear that?

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:57.511
Where is he?

01:15:57.929 --> 01:15:59.556
Where are you?

01:16:01.809 --> 01:16:02.977
Come on!

01:16:07.274 --> 01:16:08.776
I'm getting downstairs.

01:16:10.028 --> 01:16:12.573
Come on, I hear him, downstairs!

01:16:13.824 --> 01:16:14.492
Mike!

01:16:14.659 --> 01:16:15.577
Come on!

01:16:15.827 --> 01:16:16.495
Mike!

01:16:16.662 --> 01:16:17.496
Josh!

01:16:17.705 --> 01:16:18.956
Wait!

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.467
Josh, is that you down there?

01:16:28.305 --> 01:16:34.207
