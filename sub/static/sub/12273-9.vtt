WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:07.308
(horns honking)

00:13.081 --> 00:15.349
(indistinct chatter)

00:18.352 --> 00:20.054
Excuse me.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.323
Hey, come on, man, just watch
where you're standing, please.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.058
MAN 2:
Hey, sit over here.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.026
MAN 3:
Hey, chill out,
all right?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.532
MAN 1:
You stepped on
my foot again.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.201
Please don't do
that, all right?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.236
MAN 3:
Look, I'm sorry.
Would you just relax?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.713
What the hell is
your problem, man?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.215
You stepped on my foot,
like, three times.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.082
MAN 3:
Just get out of my face.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.650
I don't want any trouble.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.252
Hey, if you do it again,
jackass, you're a dead man.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.520
Yeah, whatever.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.589
(horn honks)

00:55.623 --> 00:58.226
(people grunting)

00:58.259 --> 01:01.162
MAN 1: I warned you, man.
MAN 3: Dude, it's the bus.
It's not my fault.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.330
NYPD. Drop the knife!

01:02.363 --> 01:03.664
Go to hell!

01:03.697 --> 01:04.798
Hey! Move!

01:04.831 --> 01:06.300
(people screaming)

01:09.370 --> 01:11.339
(grunting)

01:11.372 --> 01:13.674
BYSTANDER:
Keep pressure on it.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.109
WOMAN:
You'll be okay.
Call an ambulance.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.410
Get up.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.671
(sighs)

01:43.704 --> 01:46.274
(distant sirens)

01:48.376 --> 01:50.478
Now that's just wrong.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.680
What do we know?

01:52.713 --> 01:53.847
Not much.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.384
Warehouse has been
shut down since July.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.419
Security patrol
spotted a busted gate

01:58.452 --> 02:00.721
a couple hours ago
and called it in.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.257
Some poor uni had
the unique experience

02:03.291 --> 02:05.259
of finding this horror show.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.162
TAYLOR:
They made no attempt
to conceal the body.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.830
Whoever did this knew
it would be found.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.333
Well, they either didn't care,

02:12.366 --> 02:15.503
or they were sending
a rather emphatic message.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.571
Check out the prison ink.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.340
Our boy has gang ties.

02:19.373 --> 02:23.211
"41-6-12" stands for D.P.L.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.413
Dios, Patria, Libertad.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.315
God, Fatherland, Liberty.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.283
The Dominican National Motto.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.918
Nobody loves
a good dismemberment

02:30.951 --> 02:32.653
like the Latin street crews.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.362
If this is gang-related,

02:41.395 --> 02:43.864
it may be more than murder.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.699
It could be
a declaration of war.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.335
(phone vibrating)

02:47.368 --> 02:49.337
(siren chirping)

03:04.418 --> 03:07.921
Hello? Hello?

03:13.827 --> 03:14.895
Who was it?

03:14.928 --> 03:17.265
I don't know; we got cut off.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.300
(beeps)

03:44.792 --> 03:49.330
* Out here in the fields

03:49.363 --> 03:51.999
* I fight for my meals

03:52.032 --> 03:57.671
* I get my back into my living

04:00.308 --> 04:02.443
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.420
("Tessellate" by Alt-J playing)

04:14.322 --> 04:16.324
(camera shutter clicking)

04:25.333 --> 04:29.537
* Bite chunks out of me

04:29.570 --> 04:33.374
* You're a shark
and I'm swimming *

04:33.407 --> 04:37.378
* My heart still thumps
as I bleed *

04:37.411 --> 04:42.450
* And all your friends
come sniffing *

04:42.483 --> 04:46.086
* Triangles are
my favorite shape *

04:46.119 --> 04:49.957
* Three points
where two lines meet *

04:49.990 --> 04:52.660
* Toe to toe,
back to back, let's go *

04:52.693 --> 04:56.864
* My love, it's very late

04:56.897 --> 05:02.336
* Till morning comes

05:02.370 --> 05:04.605
* Let's tessellate.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.917
Lovato!

05:16.950 --> 05:18.952
Interrogation room, now.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.556
I recognized your number
on the vic's caller I.D.

05:22.590 --> 05:23.724
I know it was you

05:23.757 --> 05:24.892
on the other end
of that line.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.527
The phone log shows
you called the vic

05:26.560 --> 05:29.430
17 times today,
all within a few hours

05:29.463 --> 05:31.432
of the poor bastard
being cut in half.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.700
Look, I didn't do
anything wrong.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.436
Convince me. Who's the body

05:35.469 --> 05:38.138
in that warehouse, and what's
your connection to him?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.574
What the hell's going on,
Lovato?

05:40.608 --> 05:42.843
Vic's name is Benny Madera.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.379
He was a part
of a drug case I worked.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.647
Why did you call him today?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.081
There was a new
development.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.550
You should have called
your supervisor.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.385
I did.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.454
I told my DEA liaison
everything.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.722
You don't believe me?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.725
Robert Hicks. Go
check for yourself.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.992
I had a responsibility

05:59.026 --> 06:00.761
to tell Benny
his life was in danger.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.596
And how did you know that?

06:02.630 --> 06:05.833
(sighs) One of his associates
made me as a cop this morning.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.100
MAN:
I warned you, man!

06:07.134 --> 06:08.402
MAN 2: Dude, it's the bus.
It's not my fault.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.137
NYPD! Drop the knife!
Go to hell, man.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.439
(overlapping shouting)

06:11.472 --> 06:13.474
(man gasping, woman screams)

06:13.507 --> 06:15.943
I think I'm the reason
why Benny's dead.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.983
Benny was known

06:23.016 --> 06:24.485
as Toro on the streets.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.119
Benny the Bull.
33 years old.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.523
He's got priors for possession,
distribution, assault,

06:29.557 --> 06:31.592
all kinds of weapons charges.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.961
This guy's been in and out of
jail since he was 15 years old.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.464
LOVATO:
He was one of the subjects
on an undercover narco case

06:36.497 --> 06:38.532
I was on before I got
transferred into homicide.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.434
What was the assignment?
Infiltrating

06:40.468 --> 06:42.636
a crew of local
Trinitario gang members,

06:42.670 --> 06:46.006
gathering intel
for a joint NYPD/DEA task force.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.140
Benny was
an up-and-comer.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.643
He was well-respected and
trusted by the other players.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.612
He also had a good eye
for fresh talent.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.880
DANVILLE:
He was your way

06:52.913 --> 06:54.047
into the gang?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.683
It took me months
to get under his radar,

06:55.716 --> 06:58.452
but as soon as I did,
he took me under his wing.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.754
After that, everybody knew me
as Anita Castillo,

07:00.788 --> 07:02.590
a member of Toro's crew.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.791
How long were you under?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.627
17 months.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.930
A long time to live your life
as someone else.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.565
Must have seemed
like an eternity.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.467
I was building a strong case,

07:13.501 --> 07:15.736
learning routines,
making connections.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.471
Investigation was
right on track,

07:17.505 --> 07:19.607
and then just like that,
it was over.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.774
Your cover was blown?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.543
I had no other choice
but to walk away.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.544
As far as the Trinitarios

07:23.577 --> 07:26.213
were concerned,
Anita Castillo just disappeared.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.715
And it would have stayed
like that

07:27.748 --> 07:29.583
if I hadn't taken the bus
this morning.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.619
Didn't even recognize her

07:31.652 --> 07:33.521
at first,
but the look in her eyes said

07:33.554 --> 07:36.223
she knew exactly who I was.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.659
And then I remembered
where I saw her.

07:38.692 --> 07:42.062
(Spanish rock music playing)

07:42.095 --> 07:44.097
Toro sent me.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.544
MAN:
Bye, Mama.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.145
(laughter)

07:58.178 --> 08:00.147
MAN 2:
She looks good, huh?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.149
(indistinct chatter)

08:03.651 --> 08:05.653
(Spanish music playing)

08:05.686 --> 08:08.889
Toro sent me... with this.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.004
Blood at the scene was a bust.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.706
It all came
from a single donor, the vic.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.875
Any prints?
A handful,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.076
but no hits in AFIS.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.244
I think they were just left
by old warehouse employees.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.645
Well, the Trinitarios
do know how

08:32.679 --> 08:33.746
to clean up
after themselves.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.082
You're thinking someone
in his own crew murdered him?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.284
TAYLOR: He rolled out the
red carpet for a narc.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.921
In gang culture, that's a sin
that can't go unpunished.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.256
What about the girl on the bus--
could she have done this?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.626
Maybe, but not without
the approval of a bigger player.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.894
TAYLOR:
So, the question is,

08:46.927 --> 08:48.929
who did she report to
after seeing you?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.197
Let's pick her up and find out.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.565
LOVATO:
We can't.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.601
I don't know her name.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.137
But you do know where
she was sitting on the bus.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.039
All right, I'll call the MTA.

08:59.072 --> 08:59.973
LINDSAY:
You don't have to.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.742
The stabbing made the bus
a crime scene.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.210
It's already parked
in the impound lot.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.612
(horn honking)

10:06.439 --> 10:09.042
*

10:16.116 --> 10:18.285
Sid, take a look at this.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.957
Well, whatever it is,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.793
that's certainly a
unique shade of green.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.360
Not one of Mother Nature's own?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.730
Oh, perfect timing, Jo.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.799
Uh, there's lots to tell you.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.666
Well, start by telling me

10:32.700 --> 10:34.768
how our victim ended up
in two pieces.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.303
Of course.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.039
Uh, the violent transection
occurred between

10:39.072 --> 10:40.741
the rib cage and pelvis,
penetrating

10:40.774 --> 10:43.744
mostly soft tissue, but also
severing the spinal column.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.913
There were significant
breakaway spurs and splintering

10:45.946 --> 10:48.749
on the terminal side from
where the vertebrae was cut.

10:48.782 --> 10:52.252
That's consistent with the force
provided by a motor-driven saw.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.887
But which kind?

10:53.921 --> 10:56.223
Periodic striations
on the bone

10:56.256 --> 10:59.226
rule out the circular
or reciprocating varieties.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.861
Leaving one likely culprit.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.196
This man was cut in half
by a chain saw.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.397
Even more disturbing,

11:04.431 --> 11:08.101
the rawness of the surrounding
flesh suggests that our victim

11:08.135 --> 11:10.103
was still alive
when the sawing began.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.939
HAWKES:
Fortunately, the shock

11:11.972 --> 11:13.440
and massive blood loss
wouldn't have

11:13.473 --> 11:15.442
kept him that way for very long.
Right.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.277
Can you tell me
why his legs are frozen

11:17.310 --> 11:18.211
in this kneeling position?

11:18.245 --> 11:21.849
Spontaneous onset of rigor
as the result of

11:21.882 --> 11:22.983
cadaveric spasms.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.117
More specifically:
tetany.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.753
Muscle contractions caused by

11:25.786 --> 11:27.888
prolonged periods
of continued stimulation.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.890
In this case, caused by

11:29.923 --> 11:32.359
repetitive and deliberate
electric shocks.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.728
He was tortured first?

11:34.762 --> 11:35.763
Yeah.

11:35.796 --> 11:39.967
Confirmed by these
electrical burns.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.803
DANVILLE: So what do you think
caused these penetrating wounds?

11:42.836 --> 11:45.839
Not sure, but I'm hoping
these green flakes I found

11:45.873 --> 11:47.908
embedded in the tissue
will shed some light.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.209
(screen beeps)

11:49.242 --> 11:50.277
(Ross groans)

11:50.310 --> 11:53.747
Little heads up on
the slasher flick would be nice.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.749
Got something, Adam?

11:55.783 --> 11:58.919
Well, yeah, besides nightmares
for the next three weeks.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.789
Okay, we got a CODIS hit on
our mystery girl from the bus.

12:01.822 --> 12:05.392
DNA on her soda straw
is a match to Carmen Vega.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.262
Rap sheet a mile long and known
gang tie to the Trinitarios.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.297
Good work.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.298
Thanks.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.100
(gagging)

12:13.133 --> 12:15.502
(sirens wailing)

12:18.972 --> 12:21.441
FLACK:
Carmen Vega, NYPD!

12:21.474 --> 12:23.176
Stop!

12:23.210 --> 12:25.979
(sirens wailing)

12:32.585 --> 12:33.921
Stop! Hey!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.064
Carmen, give up!
Give up!

12:52.105 --> 12:52.906
It's over, Carmen.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.374
FLACK: Get down
on the ground now

12:54.407 --> 12:55.442
and put your hands up!

12:58.145 --> 13:00.047
Don't do it.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.182
It's too far; you
won't make it!

13:07.988 --> 13:09.256
(gasps)

13:10.357 --> 13:12.025
(screaming)

13:32.045 --> 13:35.515
Yeah, Lovato--
she's a pretty good cop.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.517
She's got a bright future.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.019
Agreed.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.954
Thank you for meeting
with us, Agent Hicks.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.089
Much appreciated.
Yeah.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.157
Heard you had
a little falling out

13:44.191 --> 13:46.126
with Carmen Vega earlier today.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.931
Young woman made a bad decision,
paid for it with her life.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.532
Yeah.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.036
Gallows humor--
occupational hazard, I guess.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.104
DANVILLE:
We believe Carmen ran

13:57.137 --> 13:59.006
because she's involved
with Benny Madera's murder.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.274
I heard that, too.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.910
Carmen may have been
connected to Benny's murder,

14:02.943 --> 14:03.977
but she didn't
act alone.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.913
We need background information
on her associates.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.248
Let me show you what I've got.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.250
Come on in.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.922
Trinitarios--
one of the fastest-growing gangs

14:14.955 --> 14:16.223
on the East Coast.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.558
And one of the most violent.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.428
They originated inside the New
York Department of Corrections?

14:21.461 --> 14:24.932
Yeah, as a protection squad
for Dominican inmates.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.900
They got tired of working
for other gangs.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.902
They decided
to unify on the streets

14:28.936 --> 14:29.903
under their own identity.

14:29.937 --> 14:30.971
Now they got a presence

14:31.004 --> 14:31.972
in neighborhoods
all over the city,

14:32.005 --> 14:35.342
and they're starting to spread
to the suburbs.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.377
Anywhere they can sell
their drugs and guns.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.913
As long as they do,
Mexican and Colombian cartels

14:39.947 --> 14:42.082
will keep providing
them with product.

14:42.115 --> 14:42.950
Where does Benny fit in?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.918
Benny?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.220
Middle management
in a splinter crew

14:47.254 --> 14:49.089
out of Washington Heights.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.125
He had a dozen or so runners,
drug dealers working for him.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.560
Who did he take orders from?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.195
Well, my best guess is

14:55.228 --> 14:57.397
one of these three
mystery lowlifes.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.099
Lovato was
supposed to find out

14:59.132 --> 15:00.600
who they were, but Benny--

15:00.633 --> 15:03.003
he was always very careful.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.704
Never mentioned a name
or anything else

15:04.737 --> 15:06.439
that would expose
who was above him.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.441
What do we know
about Carmen Vega?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.609
Low-level foot soldier.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.012
Not much street cred
to speak of.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.513
Seeing Lovato
on that bus

15:13.546 --> 15:16.116
provided the perfect opportunity
to change that.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.051
Carmen was
the only one who knew

15:18.085 --> 15:19.219
Lovato's real identity.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.721
And that Benny had
vouched for a cop.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.025
Sharing information
with the right person

15:25.058 --> 15:28.295
would have ensured her
instant career advancement.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.063
Mm-hmm. Have a seat.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.202
So what about Detective
Lovato's safety?

15:36.736 --> 15:39.539
I need to know
they won't target her next.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.542
Well, even the Trinitarios
wouldn't cross that line.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.711
Going after a cop
would bring too much heat.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.680
And even if
they wanted to,

15:47.714 --> 15:49.582
they're not gonna
get the chance.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.018
Why's that?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.519
Well, in a few days,

15:52.552 --> 15:55.055
a grand jury is gonna hand down
a RICO indictment

15:55.088 --> 15:56.056
on the Trinitarios.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.091
60 counts,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.126
21 defendants.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.493
And once they flip,

16:00.527 --> 16:04.031
we're looking at, uh,
two dozen bonus convictions.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.100
Look, I'm sorry about
Carmen and Benny,

16:07.134 --> 16:09.202
but if they weren't dead
already, they'd be spending

16:09.236 --> 16:11.671
the rest of their miserable
lives behind bars.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.174
That doesn't change the fact
that we have a murder to solve.

16:14.207 --> 16:18.645
I think Benny was killed to send
a message to the Trinitarios

16:18.678 --> 16:21.181
not to make the same mistake.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.650
Whoever did it wanted people
in his crew talking about it.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.119
We need to find out
what they're saying.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.021
If there's chatter
on the streets, I got a C.I.

16:28.055 --> 16:31.291
in my bag that's gonna
tell us all about it.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.492
(dialing)

16:32.525 --> 16:34.027
* Running from a rhythm

16:34.061 --> 16:36.029
* Hiding from the summer

16:36.063 --> 16:37.397
* Tell me I'm forgiven

16:37.430 --> 16:39.232
* Treat me like a brother

16:50.243 --> 16:52.379
* Running from a rhythm

16:52.412 --> 16:54.314
* Hiding from the summer

16:54.347 --> 16:56.683
* Tell me I'm forgiven

16:56.716 --> 16:58.451
* Treat me like a brother

16:58.485 --> 17:00.420
* Lay down a warning

17:00.453 --> 17:02.755
* Your shoulders of fortune

17:05.258 --> 17:08.761
* Make you feel like a light
turned on in your head *

17:08.795 --> 17:13.733
* And you curse all the words
you said in her bed *

17:13.766 --> 17:16.469
* Feels like a fall
from all you know *

17:16.502 --> 17:18.570
* And the hold on your goals

17:18.605 --> 17:22.142
* Have passed like that
from you. *

17:35.855 --> 17:38.358
*

18:06.686 --> 18:08.555
Raymond wants to
tell you something

18:08.588 --> 18:09.822
about the Benny Madera murder.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.823
Come on.
Yeah!

18:10.857 --> 18:12.292
Come on.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.463
I'm listening.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.368
Okay, if I was a cop, I'd be
looking for a boy named Toasty.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.735
Toasty?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.238
He's been in Benny's crew
for about a year.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.240
Real name is Hector.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.741
I don't remember his last name.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.244
How'd you know Hector was
involved in Benny's murder?

18:36.216 --> 18:39.152
Toasty's got
a big mouth, okay?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.221
He's been bragging about
doing Toro with

18:41.254 --> 18:42.889
a chain saw in some warehouse
on the West Side.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.757
Where'd you hear that?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.459
Around the way.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.627
Come on.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.230
All right, all right,
go wait by the car.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.665
Look, the kid's
got a bad attitude,

18:52.699 --> 18:54.534
but he's the real deal.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.269
When it comes to
reliable information,

18:56.303 --> 18:58.905
he's batting
a thousand.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.274
If Raymond said he heard

19:01.308 --> 19:06.246
Toasty killed Benny,
trust me, that's who did.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.415
(cell phone vibrating)

19:08.448 --> 19:10.517
(phone beeps)

19:10.550 --> 19:13.686
What do you got, Sheldon?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.189
The trace from the electrical
burns on Benny's chest

19:16.223 --> 19:17.257
is automotive paint.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.293
As you know, manufacturers use
slightly different

19:20.327 --> 19:22.195
paint components and pigments
for each model made.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.630
They also change
the formulas every year.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.697
Right.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.267
So I ran the sample
through the diffractometer,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.835
then compared
the isolated phases

19:28.868 --> 19:30.337
to the various OEM databases.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.773
Came back as a GM color
called Seamist Green--

19:33.806 --> 19:36.209
aka Springfield Green
and Pinehurst Green.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.745
That formulation
was only used in 1972,

19:38.778 --> 19:40.747
but on eight of GM's
most popular.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.782
Skylark, Firebird, Camaro,
just to name a few.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.452
Run them through DMV,
compare registrations

19:45.485 --> 19:48.221
to known associates
of the Trinitario street gang.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.290
Anything else you can give me
to narrow this down?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.459
Hold on.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.328
Hey, Raymond.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.264
Toasty own
a green car?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.431
Yeah, a Buick.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.300
Bought it off his old man.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.304
Refine your search
to only '72 Buicks.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.473
Title transferred to
a Hector from an owner

20:06.506 --> 20:07.674
of the same last name.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.309
Okay, I'm on it.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.444
What's, uh, what's going on?

20:11.478 --> 20:15.582
Looks like Raymond's hitting
streak might still stand.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.461
Hector "Toasty" Mendez.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.464
This guy should get a gold medal
in the felony Olympics.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.666
He's got 17 arrests this year

20:33.700 --> 20:35.968
and two open drug warrants
to boot.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.505
If he killed Benny, warrants are
the least of his worries.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.572
Yeah.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.442
I never would have pegged
you as an undercover.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.845
I guess that's kind of the
point though, isn't it?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.381
Yeah. Kinda.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.518
(both laugh)

20:51.551 --> 20:56.523
You know, the view inside
wasn't what I expected.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.359
After a while, targets stop
looking like targets

20:59.392 --> 21:03.896
and they started looking like...
ordinary people.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.699
Ordinary people
who sell drugs to kids

21:06.733 --> 21:09.369
and solve their problems
with a chain saw.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.739
Boys like that get recruited
as young as nine.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.407
Now, that's not an excuse

21:14.441 --> 21:17.344
for what they grow up to become
and things that they do.

21:17.377 --> 21:21.581
They join 'cause they want to
feel loved, accepted, safe.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.483
Things they don't feel at home.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.051
Things I didn't feel at home.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.086
You found a better way.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.756
I got lucky.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.724
Went to go live with my abuela.

21:31.758 --> 21:36.629
She made my brothers and me
feel special, protected.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.065
But it came pretty damn close.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.968
Flip of a coin, I wouldn't be
sitting in a cop car,

21:42.001 --> 21:43.370
I'd be running from it.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.372
That doesn't mean
we should take it easy

21:45.405 --> 21:47.440
on the ones
who weren't so lucky.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.509
Somebody breaks the law,
they get locked up.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.377
End of story.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.746
But not all offenders
are the same.

21:53.780 --> 21:57.584
People can surprise you
sometimes.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.786
What about
Benny Madera?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.888
Did he surprise you?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.992
(lively chatter)

22:10.663 --> 22:13.433
("After Dark"
by Tito & Tarantula playing)

22:17.870 --> 22:20.940
* Watching her

22:20.973 --> 22:23.710
* Strolling in the night

22:23.743 --> 22:25.745
* So white

22:25.778 --> 22:30.016
* Wondering why

22:30.049 --> 22:33.553
* It's only after dark

22:40.993 --> 22:45.632
* In her eyes

22:45.665 --> 22:47.700
* A distant firelight

22:47.734 --> 22:52.138
* Burns bright wondering

22:52.171 --> 22:53.606
* Why

22:53.640 --> 22:56.643
* It's only after dark

23:04.817 --> 23:08.521
* I find myself

23:08.555 --> 23:11.524
* In her room...

23:11.558 --> 23:13.726
Gracias, papi.
Mira, mami chula.

23:14.927 --> 23:15.828
You want my money...

23:17.630 --> 23:18.898
...you're gonna have
to earn it the hard way.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.634
(grunts)

23:21.668 --> 23:22.735
Was that hard enough?

23:24.103 --> 23:25.137
(speaks Spanish)

23:31.944 --> 23:34.080
You handle yourself
real good, chica.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.717
I'm good at a lot of things.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.622
¿Cómo te llamas?

23:42.655 --> 23:44.457
Anita.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.958
I'm Benny.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.561
Mi amigos call me Toro.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.531
Interested in being
my friend, Anita?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.733
Friends I got.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.768
A job's what I need.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.938
I'll make you a deal.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.974
Beat me...

24:03.009 --> 24:04.644
...and I'll put you to work.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.450
Rack 'em.

24:12.519 --> 24:16.723
* Now I know her secret name.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.495
(indistinct conversation)

24:22.529 --> 24:24.697
There's our guy.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.800
Truchas! Five-O!

24:29.569 --> 24:31.738
(tires screech, horn honks)

24:35.742 --> 24:37.009
Cierra la puerta!

24:37.844 --> 24:39.045
(grunting)

24:42.615 --> 24:43.850
(speaks Spanish)

24:43.883 --> 24:45.084
(grunts)

24:46.686 --> 24:49.556
(grunting)

24:49.589 --> 24:50.723
(groans)

24:50.757 --> 24:51.924
You all right?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.760
Yeah, never better.
Cochina!

24:53.793 --> 24:56.228
(speaking Spanish)

24:56.262 --> 24:58.698
Hey! Moron, one
more word out of you,

24:58.731 --> 25:01.033
and I'm gonna duct
tape your mouth shut.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.276
(horn honking)

25:10.309 --> 25:13.079
TAYLOR:
We've got you at 25 vials
of crack, Toasty.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.181
Those drugs weren't mine.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.550
They were in your pockets,
Hector.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.018
I was holding them for a friend.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.086
You've got an answer

25:20.119 --> 25:21.721
for everything.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.790
So tell me why you murdered
Benny Madera.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.726
(chuckling):
Hells, no, you ain't
pinning that on me.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.827
Then who did kill Benny?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.962
All I know is what I heard.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.866
The Bull got got, 'cause he was
played by the hot lady cop.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.068
TAYLOR (over speaker):
We found your green Buick.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.738
HECTOR:
Great, 'cause I lost it.
When do I get it back?

25:38.771 --> 25:39.839
TAYLOR:
Never.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.841
It was recovered from
an abandoned lot in Queens.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.876
Somebody doused
the interior with gasoline

25:43.910 --> 25:45.344
and set it on fire.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.314
Most likely in an attempt
to destroy evidence.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.316
But, you know,

25:50.349 --> 25:54.754
the beauty of a 1972 Buick
is very few plastic parts.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.625
Means the fire
spread nice and slow.

25:58.658 --> 26:02.695
Gave the FDNY plenty of time
to put out the blaze

26:02.729 --> 26:05.965
before the car and its contents
were completely burned.

26:09.769 --> 26:12.071
Guess what we found
in your trunk.

26:12.104 --> 26:16.776
The jumper cables and battery
used to torture Benny.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.011
As well as the chain saw
used to cut him in half

26:19.045 --> 26:20.112
while he was still alive.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.081
You got a clever

26:22.114 --> 26:23.983
explanation for that, Hector?
I had nothing

26:24.016 --> 26:25.718
to do with those things,
I swear.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.820
Then why were they in your car?
Other day

26:27.854 --> 26:29.789
my homegirl Carmen
stops by my place.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.324
Says she needs to borrow
my ride to run some errands,

26:32.358 --> 26:33.793
so I gave it to her,

26:33.826 --> 26:35.762
but she never
brought it back.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.130
Who knows?

26:38.164 --> 26:40.633
Maybe it was Carmen
who sawed off the Bull.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.735
Too bad you can't ask her.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.871
So you're blaming
Benny's murder on Carmen?

26:44.904 --> 26:47.006
Just keeping it real, Detective.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.407
Call me Honest Abe.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.242
I cannot tell a lie.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.944
That was George Washington.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.646
(scoffs)
Same difference.

26:54.681 --> 26:55.882
(groans)

26:57.717 --> 26:59.251
(door opens, shuts)

26:59.285 --> 27:00.787
What's her problem?

27:00.820 --> 27:02.822
We got the guy.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.866
(door opens)

27:13.900 --> 27:15.134
(door shuts)

27:15.167 --> 27:16.836
(siren wailing)

27:16.869 --> 27:18.871
(sighs)

27:29.015 --> 27:32.184
L, want to talk about it?

27:32.218 --> 27:33.185
No.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.687
Hey, come on,
you're gonna have

27:34.721 --> 27:35.922
to come clean with me
sooner or later.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.323
Is there something
that you want to know?

27:37.356 --> 27:38.825
Go ahead.

27:38.858 --> 27:39.892
Ask me.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.327
All right.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.795
Your relationship
with Benny

27:42.829 --> 27:44.263
was more than professional,
wasn't it?

27:44.296 --> 27:45.297
Go to hell, Flack.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.899
Oh, come on. Hey!
Whoa, hey!

27:46.933 --> 27:48.367
Am I wrong?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.803
Because from where I
stand, it looks to me

27:50.837 --> 27:51.804
like you're taking Benny's death

27:51.838 --> 27:53.873
a little more personal
than maybe you should.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.242
Damn right I'm gonna take
Benny's murder personally.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.044
Because you had
feelings for him?

27:58.077 --> 27:59.946
Because I owe him my life.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.982
(Lovato speaks Spanish)

28:04.817 --> 28:06.685
Siéntete.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.724
¿Todo bien?

28:11.758 --> 28:13.793
I know, Anita.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.127
I know what you really are.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.128
A cop.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.463
That's crazy.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.832
You know I would never front
like that.
Stop.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.437
I'm not mad.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.840
I understand you did
what you had to do.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.976
It's the way
this game is played.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.885
I just wish it had been
anybody but you.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.453
You're better
than all this, Benny.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.489
You have to know that.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.963
You have to walk away, chula.

28:50.997 --> 28:53.900
And never show your face
around here again,

28:53.933 --> 28:55.935
'cause if you do
there's only one way out

28:55.968 --> 28:58.304
for either one of us--

28:58.337 --> 29:01.307
that's with blood.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.242
How'd he make you as a cop?

29:03.275 --> 29:04.410
He never told me.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.945
He didn't tell
anybody else either.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.179
Because if he would have,

29:07.213 --> 29:10.249
I would've been hanging in that
warehouse right next to him.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.918
So the whole time
you were busy playing Benny,

29:11.951 --> 29:13.853
he was busy falling
in love with you.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.888
That's why I was relieved
to walk away.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.990
Different time, different place,

29:18.024 --> 29:20.259
something might have
happened between us.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.795
But my job means more to me
than just about anything.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.463
So if you think for one second

29:24.496 --> 29:28.100
I would do anything to
jeopardize that, you're crazy.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.138
(siren wailing)

30:02.902 --> 30:05.237
*

30:21.553 --> 30:25.424
ROSS:
The fire obliterated
the interior of the car

30:25.457 --> 30:27.326
along with any trace
that might've been in it.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.596
I did, though, uh, get a partial
print on the door handle.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.965
All right, good.
Maybe we'll get lucky with AFIS.

30:32.999 --> 30:33.765
What about the saw?

30:33.799 --> 30:35.935
Eh, this blade's covered
in blood,

30:35.968 --> 30:37.536
tissue, bone fragments.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.471
I'll bet the farm,

30:39.505 --> 30:41.007
it comes back to Benny Madera.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.374
Well, looks like we got
our murder weapon.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.276
Yeah, but the heat melted
the plastic handles

30:44.310 --> 30:47.346
and any chance of pulling
a print off of 'em.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.381
Same thing
with the jumper cables.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.521
But at least now we know what
caused the vic's chest wounds.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.157
Green paint flakes could've
transferred to the vic's wound

30:58.190 --> 30:59.658
from the negative polarity
clamp...

30:59.691 --> 31:03.529
Which gets connected to the
metal ground of the car...

31:03.562 --> 31:05.898
sometimes covered in paint.

31:05.932 --> 31:09.068
DANNY:
We got some trace Hawkes
found on our vic.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.436
Question is,

31:10.469 --> 31:12.071
what the hell is this?
Looks like some sort

31:12.104 --> 31:13.305
of melted plastic.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.640
You think it's connected?

31:14.673 --> 31:17.876
I'm not sure,
but I will find out.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.446
(chain saw buzzing)

31:22.481 --> 31:25.051
Not your first time
with a chain saw?

31:25.084 --> 31:27.086
I'm from Montana, Mac--
if I hadn't left,

31:27.119 --> 31:29.021
I'd probably be a lumberjack
right now.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.990
Okay, check this out.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.591
Sid said that Benny Madera
was cut

31:32.624 --> 31:33.960
on a horizontal axis,

31:33.993 --> 31:36.628
one inch above the iliac
crest of his pelvis.

31:36.662 --> 31:37.629
Directionality

31:37.663 --> 31:39.398
of the blade marks
and striations

31:39.431 --> 31:41.433
on the bone would suggest

31:41.467 --> 31:43.069
that the incision was initiated

31:43.102 --> 31:44.670
on his right lateral side.

31:44.703 --> 31:47.106
Why does that matter?
Well,

31:47.139 --> 31:49.175
our only suspect,
Hector "Toasty" Mendez

31:49.208 --> 31:50.442
is right-handed.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.611
Okay.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.381
Cutting from the left,

31:55.414 --> 31:58.084
he wouldn't have had
any leverage over the saw.

31:58.117 --> 32:02.054
Resulting in a less consistent
and level cut trajectory.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.056
Right. But if he was
left-handed,

32:04.090 --> 32:06.025
and his dominant hand

32:06.058 --> 32:07.259
was guiding the saw,
then leverage

32:07.293 --> 32:08.560
wouldn't have been an issue,

32:08.594 --> 32:10.963
and he could've made
a straight, steady cut.

32:10.997 --> 32:14.000
Well, I'm not sure that's enough
to rule out Hector entirely.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.468
I knew you were gonna say that,
so try this on for size.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.972
The easiest way to make a steady
cut with a 20-pound chain saw

32:20.006 --> 32:22.508
is to keep your elbows down
and hold the blade

32:22.541 --> 32:25.044
directly in front
of you.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.278
Lines up perfectly.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.746
Lucky for us

32:27.779 --> 32:29.181
if Hector Mendez
was over six feet tall,

32:29.215 --> 32:30.349
which he isn't.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.653
He's only
five-foot-six.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.056
He could've been standing
on something, too.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.690
Not according to the blood
spatter at the scene.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.426
There was no void in the floor.

32:42.461 --> 32:46.065
Hector was telling the truth.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.099
He didn't kill Benny.

33:01.580 --> 33:05.217
(whirring)

33:14.460 --> 33:16.262
*

33:46.592 --> 33:49.795
If Hector Mendez
didn't kill Benny, who did?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.630
Let's ask the person
who accused him

33:51.663 --> 33:52.831
in the first place.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.401
Hicks' confidential
informant, Raymond?

33:55.434 --> 33:57.436
Well, either he got bad
information on the street

33:57.469 --> 33:59.538
or was flat-out lying
to cover for somebody else.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.173
DANNY:
I would say smart money's

34:01.207 --> 34:02.241
on option number two.

34:02.274 --> 34:05.077
The melted plastic
from the trunk of the Buick was

34:05.111 --> 34:07.713
a heavyweight poncho made
of ethylene vinyl acetate.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.815
Benny's blood was all over it.
DANVILLE:
Killer must've been

34:09.848 --> 34:11.583
wearing it while he
was cutting him up.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.619
(revving motor)

34:15.154 --> 34:18.123
(screaming)

34:19.257 --> 34:21.726
The plastic distorted
when it was exposed to the heat,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.094
encasing several items

34:23.129 --> 34:25.197
that were
balled-up inside--

34:25.231 --> 34:27.132
leather gloves
and a bloody rag

34:27.166 --> 34:28.234
with one eyelash attached.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.801
The poncho and
the gloves

34:29.835 --> 34:32.438
protected the killer's clothing
and hands from blood spatter

34:32.471 --> 34:34.206
but not their face.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.143
DANVILLE:
So they wiped their face
with the rag,

34:37.176 --> 34:38.677
rolled it up inside the poncho
with the gloves,

34:38.710 --> 34:40.478
and hoped that the car fire
would destroy it.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.614
Right, which would've
worked if the flames
had reached the trunk,

34:42.648 --> 34:45.184
but the samples were only
exposed to indirect heat.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.120
So I was able
to extract two distinct

34:48.154 --> 34:49.688
DNA profiles
from the fibers.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.158
One from Benny Madera's blood.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.391
The other from
the epithelials transferred

34:53.425 --> 34:55.226
when the killer
was wiping his face.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.628
Now, the heat
did cause the cells

34:56.661 --> 34:58.664
to lyse, but I was able
to get a complete profile.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.299
Okay, tell me you
found a CODIS match.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.334
(Southern accent):
Yes, ma'am.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.703
Raymond Cruz.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.438
Raymond wants
to tell you something

35:06.472 --> 35:08.340
about the Benny
Madera murder.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.611
Hicks' C.I. tortured
and murdered Benny Madera.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.319
(siren wailing)

35:20.352 --> 35:23.289
DANVILLE:
Science doesn't lie, Raymond,

35:23.322 --> 35:25.391
no matter how long
you stare at it.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.293
DNA proves you killed
Benny Madera,

35:27.326 --> 35:28.560
there's no question
about that.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.598
Then what the hell
is your question?

35:32.631 --> 35:34.600
I want to know why.

35:34.633 --> 35:38.337
Was it because Benny
invited an undercover cop

35:38.370 --> 35:40.206
into the crew?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.940
That's why he got
the jumper cables.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.343
But that's not the
reason he had to die.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.311
What was?

35:45.344 --> 35:47.246
Payback.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.784
Eight months ago, DEA
busts down my door,

35:52.818 --> 35:56.455
finds a big stash of rock
Toro asked me to sit on.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.557
I could have done ten years,

35:58.590 --> 36:00.559
handled it easy.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.362
But Agent Hicks told me
the weight was enough

36:03.395 --> 36:05.331
to buy me a mandatory
life sentence.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.399
Said there was
only one way out.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.735
To inform on your
fellow gang members.
Hicks...

36:09.768 --> 36:11.270
owned my ass.

36:11.303 --> 36:14.240
Made me earn my freedom by
being his full-time rat.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.408
I would have been a
freer man behind bars.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.910
So you blame Benny for
putting you in that position,

36:18.944 --> 36:21.313
when you chose to live
your life as a criminal?

36:22.348 --> 36:25.517
Benny broke the code.

36:25.551 --> 36:29.321
You think he informed
the police about the drugs?

36:29.355 --> 36:32.424
Not until Carmen found
out Anita was a cop.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.726
That's when I knew
Benny had sold me out.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.428
You're wrong, Raymond.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.430
Benny didn't sell you
or anybody else out.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.931
You killed him
because you thought

36:39.965 --> 36:41.433
he betrayed you
and the Trinitarios,

36:41.467 --> 36:43.269
but the reality is,
there was only

36:43.302 --> 36:45.337
one person doing that,
and that was you.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.242
Only you.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.282
Put it down on paper.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.498
You got a set
of brass balls, Taylor.

37:12.531 --> 37:15.667
What the hell is my informant
doing in police custody?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.736
At the moment, he's
writing out a confession

37:17.769 --> 37:19.538
for the murder
of Benny Madera.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.374
Hector "Toasty" Mendez
killed Benny.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.509
No, he didn't.

37:23.542 --> 37:27.779
Carmen Vega reported to Raymond
that Lovato was a cop.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.848
He told her
to borrow Hector's car,

37:29.881 --> 37:31.350
then together
they jumped Benny,

37:31.383 --> 37:32.818
tossed him
in the trunk,

37:32.851 --> 37:34.620
and brought him
to that warehouse.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.789
(speaking Spanish)

37:37.823 --> 37:39.358
Ah?

37:40.426 --> 37:41.360
(shouts)

37:41.393 --> 37:44.363
(zapping)
(Benny screams)

37:44.396 --> 37:45.564
(grunts)

37:45.597 --> 37:47.032
(speaking
Spanish)

37:47.899 --> 37:49.468
(zapping)
(grunting)

37:50.936 --> 37:52.738
Raymond shocked Benny
with a car battery

37:52.771 --> 37:54.640
over and over again,
demanding to know

37:54.673 --> 37:57.042
what he told Lovato
about the Trinitarios,

37:57.075 --> 37:58.977
if he was an
undercover cop, too.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.313
Of course, Benny
was a dead man,

38:01.347 --> 38:03.315
no matter what he said.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.457
(motor starts)

38:11.490 --> 38:14.460
(revving motor)

38:16.862 --> 38:18.063
(screaming)

38:22.534 --> 38:24.336
Raymond pointed the
finger at Hector Mendez

38:24.370 --> 38:26.772
to cover his own ass,
but you already knew that.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.507
What are you talking about?

38:28.540 --> 38:31.577
We subpoenaed
your C.I. contact reports.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.779
You met with Raymond
Cruz one hour

38:33.812 --> 38:35.814
after Benny's body
was discovered.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.351
So what?

38:39.385 --> 38:42.688
He never mentioned one word
about committing any murder.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.022
He didn't have to.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.392
It was where the
two of you met

38:46.425 --> 38:47.826
that spoke volumes.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.540
You're late.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.410
I was saying good-bye
to an old friend.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.745
Whose car is this?

39:06.778 --> 39:08.947
I borrowed it.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.890
We lifted your fingerprint

39:18.924 --> 39:20.926
off the door handle.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.432
You were in Hector's Buick.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.934
So when you heard me ask
about it in the garage,

39:28.967 --> 39:30.769
you knew that Raymond
was lying about him,

39:30.802 --> 39:32.738
and you knew why.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.440
Hey, Raymond...

39:34.473 --> 39:36.475
Toasty own a green car?

39:36.508 --> 39:37.543
Yeah, Buick.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.478
Bought it off his old man.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.451
Do you have any idea
how important he is?

39:45.484 --> 39:47.185
Raymond can serve up
the Trinitarios

39:47.218 --> 39:48.454
on a silver platter.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.424
Drugs, kidnapping,
murders-- all of it.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.827
We can take them down...

39:55.861 --> 40:00.499
if my star witness gets on
the stand and spills his guts.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.734
Doesn't it bother you
that your star witness

40:02.768 --> 40:05.203
is a sadistic, cold-
blooded killer?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.673
I can live with that,

40:07.706 --> 40:11.643
considering what he means
to the big picture.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.980
The only picture I see is
of a man fooling himself.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.549
You had a responsibility
to uphold the letter

40:17.583 --> 40:19.084
of the law, not
pick and choose

40:19.117 --> 40:20.819
the parts that make
your job easier!

40:20.852 --> 40:23.989
I spent four years of my life
building this case,

40:24.022 --> 40:27.225
and nothing about that was easy.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.027
And you want me
to throw it all away

40:29.060 --> 40:30.796
because some
gangbanging degenerate

40:30.829 --> 40:32.531
couldn't control himself?

40:32.564 --> 40:35.901
Raymond didn't compromise
this case, Hicks.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.536
You did that.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.838
(exhales)

40:44.576 --> 40:46.578
(door closes)

40:48.580 --> 40:50.582
(indistinct radio transmission)

40:58.056 --> 41:00.659
(elevator bell dings)

41:00.692 --> 41:02.661
Excuse me.
Sorry.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.563
Good night.
Night.
Night.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.074
About time you showed up.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.677
(frustrated sigh)

41:20.011 --> 41:22.247
What are you
doing here, Flack?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.549
Been a long day.

41:23.582 --> 41:24.482
Figured you might be hungry,

41:24.516 --> 41:26.685
so I bought you some takeout.
From where?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.019
Yang Chows, 39th.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.255
Well done. Best
kung pao in Midtown.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.256
Come on.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.725
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.965
Do you want to tell me
why you're really here?

41:44.202 --> 41:48.807
I was wrong to assume that
you crossed a line with Benny.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.143
You're better
than that.

41:52.177 --> 41:55.013
I was a total jerk.
I'm sorry.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.783
What you really want to know

41:57.816 --> 41:59.751
is if I slept with him.

42:02.721 --> 42:05.657
To clear the air...

42:05.691 --> 42:08.126
no... I didn't.

42:09.595 --> 42:11.029
Relieved, aren't you?

42:12.063 --> 42:14.099
What? Why?

42:14.132 --> 42:16.635
I think you're jealous.

42:18.303 --> 42:21.272
I think you're
delusional.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.274
Maybe.

42:23.308 --> 42:25.310
Maybe not.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.586
It's getting late.

42:35.621 --> 42:38.590
I should probably go.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.693
Hey, Flack.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.303
I'll see you tomorrow.
