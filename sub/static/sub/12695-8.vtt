WEBVTT

00:06.940 --> 00:09.843
- *

00:09.943 --> 00:12.046
- Oh, cheerleader tryouts...

00:12.146 --> 00:14.448
I'm hyper, and nervous,
and excited.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.350
I'm hypernervousited!

00:16.450 --> 00:17.718
- Me, too, but there's been

00:17.818 --> 00:20.188
some really serious
competition today.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.392
- Uh, yeah, but can she do this?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.433
- Okay, she's gone--
you can put it down now.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.634
- I can't.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.436
I've never done this before.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.706
- There we go.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.409
I really hope that
we make the squad.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.078
- We will, and the best part
is we'll make it together.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.380
- Phoebe, Cherry,
we're ready for you.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.581
Who wants to go first?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.150
- Can we do it at the same time?

00:49.250 --> 00:52.120
- Hmm... cheer chat!

00:54.021 --> 00:57.725
Fine, but it better
be twice as good.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.193
- Ready? Okay!

00:59.293 --> 01:00.794
- BOTH: [chanting]
Oh yeah, we're here.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.130
Get ready for our awesome cheer.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.965
Our moves are nifty,
faces look all Taylor Swifty.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.467
We can rhyme, we can shake it,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.001
Got a call, I have to take it.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.904
- Hello?
- Hey, Phoebs!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.673
How's the audition going?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.575
- I'm thinking we should
sign up for wood shop.

01:14.675 --> 01:20.181
- Why do you say that?
- Because we're nailing it!

01:20.281 --> 01:21.849
- She's Phoebs.
- She's Cherry.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.284
- BOTH: Vegans don't
eat meat or dairy.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.618
Gotta go, but we've had fun.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.488
Drop our pompoms--
this cheer's done.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.392
- [cheering]

01:31.492 --> 01:34.762
- Nice job--just give us
a moment to make our decision.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.066
- You did great.
- You, too!

01:39.167 --> 01:41.068
I told you we would
make it together.

01:41.169 --> 01:44.772
- Okay, ladies, the Raptorettes
and I have made a decision.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.474
Cherry's in!

01:49.076 --> 01:51.179
Better luck next time, Phoebe.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.415
Let's hear it for Cherry!
- ALL: [cheering]

01:54.515 --> 01:57.185
- [without enthusiasm] Yay!

01:59.920 --> 02:01.555
- Were you serious about
signing up for wood shop?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.391
- No.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.395
- *

02:07.495 --> 02:10.264
- WOMAN: * What you see
is not what you get *

02:10.364 --> 02:13.434
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:13.534 --> 02:16.637
* We fit right in,
bet you never guessed *

02:16.737 --> 02:19.973
* Living our lives
just like all the rest *

02:20.073 --> 02:23.211
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:23.277 --> 02:26.780
* Look closer, you might
see the crazy things we do *

02:26.880 --> 02:29.983
* This isn't make-believe,
it's our reality *

02:30.083 --> 02:33.086
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:33.221 --> 02:34.822
* And stay out of trouble

02:34.922 --> 02:37.725
* Living a double life

02:47.000 --> 02:49.270
- Hey, Lionel,
what's going on here?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.339
- Guess how many pepperoni
slices in the jar

02:51.439 --> 02:53.941
and win free pizza for a month.

02:54.041 --> 02:57.345
This is the day my life changes.

02:57.445 --> 03:01.449
- Come on, any other suckeronis?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.584
- Right here.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.553
- Oh, hello, Max.

03:05.653 --> 03:09.790
I guess security at juvie's
pretty loose these days.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.693
- Here's my dollar...
and my guess.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.395
- Thanks, dummy.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.163
Okay, it's 12:00.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.732
Time to reveal the number.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.968
- [drumroll]

03:21.068 --> 03:24.772
- Shut it, band geek!

03:24.872 --> 03:29.109
Okay, the actual number of
pepperonis in the jar is...

03:29.277 --> 03:32.513
3,167! [laughing]

03:32.613 --> 03:35.849
- ALL :[sighing]
- Thanks for playing, losers.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.286
- Oh, hey, I think I won.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.787
- What?!

03:39.887 --> 03:41.922
There's no way you
could have guessed...

03:42.022 --> 03:44.292
3,167?!

03:44.358 --> 03:47.094
- Yes!
- [cheering]

03:47.194 --> 03:48.896
- Thanks, guys, but please,

03:48.996 --> 03:50.898
please chant with your words,
not with your hands.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.802
- You cheated.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.204
- I didn't cheat... I'm
just a really good guesser.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.039
You owe me a month of free za.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.409
- [scoffs]
- Play me out, band geek.

04:01.509 --> 04:06.947
- [military drumbeat]

04:07.047 --> 04:09.383
- [cheering]

04:15.623 --> 04:17.558
- There you are, Phoebs--I been
looking everywhere for you.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.926
- Oh, hey, Cherry.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.461
I figured you would just eat
lunch with the cheerleaders.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.796
- I always eat lunch with
you--you're my best friend.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.832
Besides, I can't tell who's who.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.468
I think three of them
are named Madison.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.340
- Oh, don't bother--it's broken.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.141
- [can falls]

04:36.644 --> 04:39.380
- Phoebe, I'm really sorry
that you didn't make the squad.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.349
- What, no--it's totally fine.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.184
In fact, I've been meaning
to tell you congratulaaaaa--

04:47.154 --> 04:48.889
- I'm sorry, what?

04:48.989 --> 04:52.360
- I just wanted to tell
you congratulaaaaaa--

04:54.395 --> 04:56.397
- Okay, uh, Phoebe,
are you having trouble

04:56.497 --> 04:58.732
saying congratulations to me?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.434
- Nooo, that is ridiculous.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.003
I am so happy for you
and I totally wish you...

05:03.103 --> 05:05.373
that word.

05:05.439 --> 05:09.877
- Well, when you can say
that word, just let me know.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.614
- No, Cherry, wait.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.950
Congratulaaaaaa--okay,
I'm gonna stop trying now.

05:19.787 --> 05:23.624
- Mom, Dad, you know how
you've always wanted a cat.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.726
- No.
- Not really.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.630
- Well, look no further.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.232
- Where did that come from?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.067
- A mama cat.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.169
You're supposed
to know this stuff.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.571
- We found him in the backyard.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.306
We named him Roscoe.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.810
- Can we keep him?
- No, kids, that's a wild cat.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.445
- Heck, yeah, he's wild.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.715
He eats fireflies
and his poop lights up.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.150
That never works for me.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.852
- No, no, take him back outside,

05:51.952 --> 05:54.522
and nobody feed him
or he'll keep coming back.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.524
- Come on, Mom,
look Roscoe in the eyes

05:56.624 --> 05:58.492
and tell him he can't live here.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.861
- You can't live here.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.867
- You're welcome.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.869
- BOTH: Uh-oh.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.838
- Guys, I have great news.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.573
I won a contest at Wong's--

06:12.673 --> 06:15.308
got us all free pizza
for a month!

06:15.443 --> 06:18.446
- New favorite kid!
- [alarm sounding]

06:18.546 --> 06:21.782
- FEMALE VOICE: Alert, alert,
angry Wong approaching.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.084
- Cheesy goodness approacheth.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.657
Hey, Mrs. Wong.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.225
Are those for me?

06:32.325 --> 06:34.327
- They sure are.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.769
- Oh, what is on this?

06:41.869 --> 06:45.238
- Those are fish heads,
fish head!

06:45.338 --> 06:47.074
It's the only pizza you'll get

06:47.174 --> 06:49.477
till you admit you
cheated at my contest!

06:49.577 --> 06:52.312
- I told you I did not cheat.
- Really?

06:52.480 --> 06:56.016
Well, then get ready
for a fish head tsunami.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.819
Wong out!

06:58.919 --> 07:01.154
- Max... is that true?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.856
Did you cheat?
- Of course not.

07:02.956 --> 07:06.326
I'm just a really good guesser.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.828
Right now I'm guessing my lair

07:07.928 --> 07:11.331
smells a whole lot
better than this place.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.241
- Hey, um, I'm looking
for a new elective.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.876
Is this musical harmony club?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.344
- [dissonantly] * It is
- * It is

07:24.512 --> 07:27.615
- * It is

07:27.715 --> 07:30.383
- Let me guess--you're just
doing this to get out of gym?

07:30.518 --> 07:31.819
- [dissonantly] * Duh
- * Duh

07:31.919 --> 07:33.887
- * Duh

07:36.023 --> 07:38.892
- Cheer chat.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.894
Before Cherry shows up,
let's review the plan

07:40.994 --> 07:42.362
for Friday's pep rally.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.365
First, we get Cherry to dress
in the opposing team's colors.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.536
Then, during our routine,
the Raptor sneaks up behind her

07:48.569 --> 07:51.371
and cracks a giant
fake egg over her head.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.975
She gets covered in goo,
and the crowd goes cra-nanas.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.344
- How's this for cra-nanas?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.048
- Hey, why did you do that?

08:01.148 --> 08:04.317
- I don't know.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.557
- Ugh, this smell,
I can't take it anymore.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.324
- Maybe you should stop
fanning the fish smell

08:11.424 --> 08:14.094
with a box of fish pizza.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.297
- Huh... this one doesn't
even have a pizza in it.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.300
It's just a box of fish heads.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.170
- Why do you keep
accepting the deliveries?

08:23.270 --> 08:24.638
- Hope, Barb.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.074
Hope.

08:27.174 --> 08:31.111
- [inhales deeply]

08:31.211 --> 08:33.581
Much better.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.482
Ugh, hang in there, everybody.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.685
Mrs. Wong can't
keep this up forever.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.587
- Fly, 3:00.
- Got it.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.055
- [laser shoots]

08:42.155 --> 08:45.993
- Okay, this place is officially
a 4-bedroom dumpster.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.996
Max, I think you should
just admit to Mrs. Wong

08:49.096 --> 08:50.397
that you cheated.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.165
- You think that's
what happened?

08:52.265 --> 08:54.668
- Well... isn't it?

08:54.768 --> 08:58.438
- Do any of you think I won
the contest fair and square?

09:02.442 --> 09:05.746
- [whispers loudly]
This is very awkward.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.347
- Oh, I get it.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.250
It's Max, always trying to fool
us with his perfect hair

09:10.350 --> 09:12.352
and confident swagger...

09:14.521 --> 09:16.189
so he must have cheated.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.758
- Can you blame us
for thinking that?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.993
You are kind of a supervillain.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.328
- Kind of?

09:21.428 --> 09:24.464
I can melt the North Pole
with one touch of my cell phone,

09:24.632 --> 09:27.835
but I did not cheat
on this pizza contest.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.637
Okay?

09:31.939 --> 09:35.442
- [whispers loudly]
It just got awkwarder.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.410
- Okay, I see how it is.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.379
Thanks for having
my back, family.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.650
- Max...
- [cat meows]

09:42.716 --> 09:44.718
- [whispers] Aww,
Roscoe's hungry.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.054
Follow my lead.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.022
[loudly] Come on, Billy,
let's take some pizza boxes

09:49.122 --> 09:52.325
out to the trash.
- Yes, to throw them out.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.764
No cat is involved
in what I just said.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.634
- Great practice, Madison.
- Thanks, Madison.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.436
Bye, Madison.
- Yeah, see you later, Madison.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.105
- Bye, Madisons!

10:05.205 --> 10:06.840
And Ruth.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.914
- Cherry, I have something
really important to tell you.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.184
I overheard the Madisons saying

10:17.284 --> 10:19.820
that they're planning on
cracking a giant egg full of goo

10:19.920 --> 10:22.155
over your head
at Friday's pep rally.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.324
- I can't believe this!
- I know, right?

10:24.424 --> 10:25.793
Well, at least when
you quit the squad,

10:25.893 --> 10:27.160
we can do some different
club together--

10:27.260 --> 10:29.863
anything but the harmony club.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.732
- I meant I can't
believe that you'd make up

10:31.832 --> 10:34.868
some ridiculous story
so that I'll quit the team.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.303
- What? That's not
what I'm doing.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.404
- Just admit it.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.372
You're super jelly
that I made the squad.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.708
- I'm not super jelly.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.209
I'm trying to stop you from
being humiliated

10:42.309 --> 10:43.711
in front of everyone.
- Why can't you just

10:43.811 --> 10:45.679
be happy for me
like a real friend?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.247
- Are you saying
I'm not a real friend?

10:47.347 --> 10:49.216
- That's exactly
what I'm saying.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.284
In fact... here.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.221
Take back your pink
furry protractor.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.759
- Fine, here is your calendar
of cute boys holding puppies.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.528
- And here is your snowshoe.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.898
- That's my tennis racket.

11:04.998 --> 11:09.436
Then why did it come
with this yellow snowball?

11:09.536 --> 11:11.739
- Okay, fine, so we doing this?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.741
Let's do this.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.508
Selfie of you and me
at the water park?

11:15.608 --> 11:17.510
Delete.
- [gasps]

11:20.313 --> 11:22.215
You and me wearing vintage hats?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.784
Delete.
- [gasps]

11:24.885 --> 11:26.754
Us eating sushi...
delete.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.856
- Us drinking smoothies...
delete.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.392
- Us getting sushi smoothie
stomachaches... delete.

11:32.492 --> 11:36.096
- Phone number... [beep]

11:39.666 --> 11:42.169
- Phone number... [beeps]

11:47.875 --> 11:49.777
- All right, you two, what
did you want to show us

11:49.843 --> 11:51.979
that's so important?
- Simple.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.983
One of you is a murderer.
[chuckles]

11:56.083 --> 11:59.286
Just kidding, I been reading
a lot of mystery novels.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.088
- Actually, I'm gonna
use this lie detector

12:01.188 --> 12:04.224
to prove to you guys I didn't
cheat on Mrs. Wong's contest.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.859
- Max, this again?

12:05.959 --> 12:08.395
- Hey, I want you
to know I didn't cheat.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.197
Colosso, would you show
them how it works?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.999
- I'll give you a demonstration.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.868
Max, does this house smell

12:14.968 --> 12:17.504
like the inside
of a dolphin's blowhole?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.339
- Yes.
- [bell dings]

12:19.439 --> 12:21.508
- That means he's
telling the truth.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.911
And if he lies,
you'll hear a buzz.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.946
- Got it--fire away, Colosso.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.816
- Max, did you cheat
to win Mrs. Wong's contest?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.384
- No.
- [bell dings]

12:31.484 --> 12:34.254
- There, see--even
science says I didn't cheat.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.823
- Hey, that's pretty cool.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.359
Let me try.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.863
Do you think I look
good in this top?

12:42.963 --> 12:45.298
- I love it.
- [buzzer sounds]

12:45.398 --> 12:46.934
- Hank!

12:47.034 --> 12:50.203
Well... what about my cooking?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.005
Do you love that?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.707
- Absolutely.
- [buzzer sounds]

12:54.842 --> 12:57.144
But I do love your cooking!

12:57.244 --> 12:58.411
- [laughing]

12:58.511 --> 13:01.048
- Wait a minute, what's
that button under your paw?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.151
-Uh...

13:04.251 --> 13:05.886
- You were controlling
the answers?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.687
- Yeah, you cheated
on that pizza contest.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.157
Isn't that why we're
doing this whole scam?

13:10.257 --> 13:13.393
- No! I didn't cheat!

13:13.493 --> 13:16.864
I can't believe this--everyone
in this house thinks I'm a liar.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.266
- Max!

13:19.366 --> 13:21.601
- So Hank, looks like
you been working out.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.872
- [buzzer sounds]
- [laughs]

13:31.611 --> 13:34.882
- Hey, Phoebe, Cherry dropped
of a box of your stuff

13:34.915 --> 13:38.218
and this note.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.153
- There's nothing written on it.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.656
- That's because she says
she's not talking to you.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.326
Anything you want to tell me?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.761
- [sighs] Cherry got
on the cheerleading squad

13:48.896 --> 13:50.463
and I didn't,
and then I overheard

13:50.563 --> 13:52.199
that they're gonna
pull a prank on her,

13:52.299 --> 13:54.001
and she doesn't believe me
because she thinks

13:54.101 --> 13:56.669
I'm just being jealous.
- Are you?

13:56.769 --> 14:00.740
- No! I even told her
congratulataaa...

14:00.908 --> 14:03.310
what the kids are
saying these days.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.012
- You know, honey,
every now and then,

14:05.112 --> 14:08.215
you do have a tiny
little jealous streak.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.682
Do you remember
the time that Max--

14:09.782 --> 14:11.184
- Oh, Max does
this, Max does that.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.454
You know, Phoebe
does things, too!

14:14.554 --> 14:17.790
Oh, that jealous streak.
- Yup.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.826
- Wow.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.762
If I just said congratulations,
I'd still have my best friend,

14:22.930 --> 14:24.064
wouldn't I?

14:24.164 --> 14:26.133
- She's still
your friend, Phoebe.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.500
- I hope so.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.536
Well, either way, I'm not
gonna let her get egged

14:29.636 --> 14:31.071
by a pack of Madisons.

14:31.171 --> 14:34.407
- Good for you... I think.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.210
- Thanks, Mom.
- Oh, honey, don't cry.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.379
I'm not crying.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.548
My eyes are burning
from the fish stink.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.156
- More pizzas, Roscoe.
- [cat meows]

14:51.959 --> 14:54.094
- I wonder why Mom and Dad
didn't want us to feed him.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.030
- Who doesn't love
a friendly cat?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.066
- [cats meowing]

14:59.166 --> 15:01.601
- Or three.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.041
- Welcome to the Hiddenville
High pep rally.

15:08.141 --> 15:11.044
But first, here's our
very own Mr. Noodleman

15:11.144 --> 15:13.513
with his salute to sunny Spain.

15:13.613 --> 15:18.851
- [flamenco music playing]

15:18.986 --> 15:21.121
- Hey, Madison.
- ALL: Yeah?

15:21.221 --> 15:24.257
- Isn't this the rival
team's uniform?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.159
- That's the point, Cherry.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.295
At the end of our routine,
we all embrace you

15:28.395 --> 15:31.398
in a symbolic gesture of peace
and friendship among schools.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.401
- Really, so I'm like the star.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.338
- Oh, trust me, everyone'll
be looking at you.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.308
- [squeals]

15:53.920 --> 15:56.423
- Oh, hey, Reggie the Raptor.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.292
I'm, uh, the official
egg inspector.

15:59.392 --> 16:03.130
Yup, bad egg...
better take it in.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.799
Hey, get your Jurassic
paws off it!

16:11.271 --> 16:13.940
- Why does it smell worse?

16:14.041 --> 16:17.177
- Your mom lit a eucalyptus
candle to get the stink out.

16:19.879 --> 16:23.216
- But now it just smells like
a fish wrestling a koala bear.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.353
- [alarm buzzing]
- FEMALE VOICE: Alert, alert.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.521
More fish pizza approaching.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.658
- BOTH: No!

16:33.393 --> 16:36.063
- Dinner time!
- No, Mrs. Wong.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.567
You made your point, now please
stop delivering pizzas.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.335
- I'll make you a deal.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.572
I'll stop the deliveries
and take away all these boxes

16:45.672 --> 16:49.076
if you admit that
your son cheated.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.079
- So let me get this
straight--if we say Max cheated,

16:52.179 --> 16:53.646
no more fish pizzas.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.248
- I just said that.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.354
- We've decided.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.162
- Ugh!

17:09.262 --> 17:11.464
- We believe Max.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.903
- I just wish there was
a less disgusting way

17:17.003 --> 17:19.539
to believe Max.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.608
- Okay for you, Thundermans,

17:21.708 --> 17:24.577
I've got 500 boxes
of skunk butt pizza

17:24.677 --> 17:26.113
with your name on it.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.348
- Stop!

17:28.448 --> 17:30.283
All right, Mrs. Wong, you win.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.285
- Max, what are you doing?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.020
- Mom, it's okay.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.489
Just knowing that you guys
believe me is enough.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.891
And if she needs to hear me say
the words "I cheated"

17:38.991 --> 17:41.628
for this to end, then fine.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.797
I'll even put it in writing.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.870
"I cheated.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.440
Max Thunderman."

17:53.540 --> 17:54.874
There, happy now?

17:54.974 --> 17:59.246
- Ha! I always win!
[laughing maniacally]

17:59.346 --> 18:01.281
I'm going to hang
this in my shop

18:01.381 --> 18:04.217
and everyone will
know your shame.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.186
Wong out!

18:08.755 --> 18:10.923
- Max, why'd you do that?

18:11.023 --> 18:13.193
- Wait for it...

18:13.293 --> 18:17.230
- [loud pop]

18:17.330 --> 18:18.565
- Exploding ink.

18:18.665 --> 18:22.802
Didn't cheat... but
I'm still a supervillain.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.577
- Or we can just call it a draw?

18:32.879 --> 18:34.781
- Deal.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.486
- [loud pop]

18:39.586 --> 18:41.321
- MRS. WONG: Oh, come on!

18:43.323 --> 18:47.460
- Supervillain.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.931
- Okay, my three little kitties,
this is the last of the...

18:52.031 --> 18:58.238
- [cats meowing]

18:58.338 --> 18:59.706
- We're gonna need

18:59.806 --> 19:03.276
a really big litter box.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.349
- [flamenco music playing]
- Olé!

19:09.449 --> 19:12.652
- [cheers and applause]

19:12.752 --> 19:15.855
- All right, Señor Noodleman.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.725
Fantástico! [laughs]

19:18.825 --> 19:23.062
And now our very own
Hiddenville High Raptorettes.

19:23.230 --> 19:27.734
- *

19:49.021 --> 19:50.957
- [screams]

19:55.695 --> 19:58.265
It was supposed to be her!

19:58.365 --> 20:01.200
Why do I cheer chat
if nobody ever listens?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.672
- I listened.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.842
- Phoebe?

20:09.942 --> 20:13.846
- Well, I'm not sure I
get it... but that was cool.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.516
Let's hear it
for the Raptorettes.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.051
- [cheers and applause]

20:19.151 --> 20:21.754
- Now go win that game
tonight...

20:21.854 --> 20:23.423
that I won't be at!

20:23.523 --> 20:26.993
- [cheers and applause]

20:31.197 --> 20:33.300
- I'm sorry, I should
have believed you.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.867
- And I should have
been a better friend.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.003
Congratulaaaations.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.571
- Aww...

20:40.673 --> 20:42.709
- You two ruined the pep rally.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.244
Who do you think you are?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.215
- She's Cherry.
- She's Phoebs.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.883
The Madisons are major dweebs.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.552
Gotta go, but we had fun.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.822
Drop your pompoms--
we are done.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.325
- Ooh, cheer burn.
- That just happened.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.493
- Ooh, ooh, Rap burn!

21:04.331 --> 21:07.334
- Billy, Nora,
you guys did a good job

21:07.400 --> 21:09.536
taking those pizza boxes out.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.804
- You know us--we live to clean.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.841
- [cats meowing]

21:14.941 --> 21:17.209
- Is that that cat, Roscoe?

21:17.344 --> 21:19.846
- [whispers loudly] Hard to say.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.649
- Maybe we were rough
on the little guy.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.585
I'll take him some milk.
- Dad, wait!

21:25.685 --> 21:26.786
- Yeah, let us do it!

21:26.886 --> 21:28.655
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't be silly.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.991
Truth be told, I have
a soft spot for cats.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.964
Here, kitty kitty kitty...
kitties.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.366
- [cats meowing]

21:39.432 --> 21:41.033
- HANK: Whoa, whoa...
[screaming]

21:41.133 --> 21:43.035
Get your claws
out of my soft spot!

21:43.135 --> 21:44.103
- [cats meowing]

21:44.203 --> 21:45.805
- You fed the cat, didn't you?

21:45.905 --> 21:50.276
- BOTH: Nooooo... yes.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.044
- There's gotta be
a hundred cats out there.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.981
- Eh, 128.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.216
What can I say--it's a gift.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.620
- [cats meowing]
- HANK: [screaming]
