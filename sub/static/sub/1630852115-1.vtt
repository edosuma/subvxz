02:18.706 --> 02:20.440
Hi, Mom it's Josh.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.778
Obviously, got your message.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.614
Just been practicing.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.450
I know, surprise, right?

02:30.484 --> 02:34.522
Um, anyway, the piece
is really shaping up.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.923
Can't wait to play it for you.

02:35.957 --> 02:37.424
I can't really get there

02:37.457 --> 02:39.861
before morning, so hopefully it
can wait.

02:39.894 --> 02:42.630
Um, okay, see you for breakfast.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.532
Love you.

02:59.881 --> 03:01.582
- Good morning, Charlotte.
- Morning.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.951
- Where are you going now?
- Just going.

03:03.985 --> 03:05.687
- You're always going.
- What can I say?

03:05.720 --> 03:06.954
I'm busy.

03:11.993 --> 03:14.294
Happy birthday, Grandma.

03:14.327 --> 03:15.763
- Coconut chocolate?
- Of course.

03:15.797 --> 03:16.664
Oh!

03:17.364 --> 03:19.433
When are you going to
sit down and practice?

03:19.466 --> 03:20.868
You're welcome.

03:20.902 --> 03:22.436
Thank you, dear.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.838
When are you going to practice?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.338
January.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.974
Show me your hands.

03:28.810 --> 03:32.547
These fingers have not touched
the piano.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.480
- All up here.
- Oh!

03:33.514 --> 03:35.850
All up here.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.787
Internet is ruining your work
ethic, everything is too easy.

03:39.821 --> 03:41.823
It is Grandma, especially
that pest, YouTube,

03:41.856 --> 03:43.558
filling our brains with
infinite amounts of information.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.526
I'm surprised you have
any brain left at all.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.894
Grandma, why are you on my
case?

03:49.731 --> 03:51.899
Got it, I promise.

03:51.933 --> 03:53.735
Go, prove it to me.

04:15.056 --> 04:17.558
It's tomorrow, yes?

04:17.592 --> 04:19.493
Whatever happens, happens.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.394
Up against some tough pianists.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.798
That's never stopped you
before.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.934
Back in my day, we just made
music.

04:26.968 --> 04:29.036
We didn't have to compete to
earn a living for ourselves.

04:29.070 --> 04:30.004
I know, I know.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.807
"Competition's are for
horses not artists."

04:32.840 --> 04:35.843
- Who said that?
- Your grandpa.

04:35.877 --> 04:37.945
But Bartok said at first,

04:39.947 --> 04:42.817
If you are going to have to
compete to earn your supper,

04:42.850 --> 04:44.619
you've got to commit.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.023
You will be up against
kids that eat, drink,

04:49.056 --> 04:52.794
and sleep with Bach,
Beethoven and Horowitz.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.796
- Grandma.
- Laugh all you want,

04:54.829 --> 04:58.733
but I know that Victor Zabov
has a new favorite to win.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.869
Uh, Jake or Josh or something.

05:01.903 --> 05:05.706
A favorite, it's not a horse
race.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.108
And what do you mean, you heard?

05:07.141 --> 05:09.510
My musical school is a
hot topic at bridge club?

05:09.544 --> 05:11.879
This is serious, believe me.

05:11.913 --> 05:13.981
Zabov knows all the tricks.

05:14.015 --> 05:16.483
Please, if there was
someone of that caliber,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.519
- I'd know about him.
- You can't just

05:18.553 --> 05:21.022
float through this one.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.990
I don't think I'm going to
compete.

05:23.024 --> 05:24.759
Yes you are.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.359
And besides, if I'm there
too long then who's gonna

05:26.393 --> 05:28.996
- take care of you?
- You don't worry about me.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.498
You just get yourself ready.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.868
I've never asked you for
anything,

05:33.901 --> 05:37.038
but I am asking you to
take this one seriously.

05:37.071 --> 05:40.107
- Grandma, don't get all-
- Charlotte,

05:40.141 --> 05:42.910
I've got to know you'll
be okay after I die.

05:42.944 --> 05:45.445
- Grandma, stop.
- I've got to know.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.914
I need to know.

05:46.948 --> 05:48.381
It's just the competition.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.885
We both know that's not true.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.105
You remind me of your mother.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.474
Naturally gifted, incredibly
stubborn.

06:17.612 --> 06:21.582
You're going to win that
competition tomorrow.

06:21.616 --> 06:23.416
And she'd be so proud.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.576
Yeah, it was, I'll give you
that.

07:57.078 --> 07:59.213
- When am I gonna see you?
- Oh, gosh, soon.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.214
- I'm here.
- Yeah?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.582
- I'm here.
- All right.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.950
I'm back.

08:04.285 --> 08:05.920
- Mm!
- So good to see you.

08:05.953 --> 08:09.489
- Good to see you.
- It's good to be back.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.527
Hey, Josh!

08:14.695 --> 08:15.930
Josh, wait up!

08:17.932 --> 08:18.799
Josh!

08:24.805 --> 08:26.273
What do you want?

08:27.975 --> 08:30.644
Just a moment to talk with my
son.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.014
You're 20 years too late.

08:33.047 --> 08:35.783
I know, but I'm back for good,
I swear.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.884
I'm here for good.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.120
I can't deal with this right
now.

08:39.153 --> 08:40.821
Josh, Josh, stop!

08:53.367 --> 08:54.235
Thank you.

08:56.237 --> 08:57.104
Thank you.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.776
Your mom tells me about the
competition.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.311
She says every pianist who's won

09:04.345 --> 09:07.648
goes on to have lucrative
careers.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.283
That's exciting.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.851
I'm proud of you.

09:12.053 --> 09:17.224
Hey, you know, it would mean
a lot to me if you'd come by.

09:17.491 --> 09:22.063
It's no big London
competition, but it's a start.

09:22.096 --> 09:24.298
For me to be here for good.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.806
You would name an entire
gallery after yourself.

09:47.922 --> 09:49.957
Good morning, Barbara.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.126
How you doing, you look well
today.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.261
Uh, thank you, your
mom's in the kitchen.

09:54.295 --> 09:55.262
Thanks.

09:57.698 --> 10:02.203
Ew, boy, when was the
last time you showered?

10:02.236 --> 10:05.306
You can't keep a schedule like
this without getting sick.

10:05.339 --> 10:09.276
You need sleep and food that
doesn't come from a paper bag.

10:09.310 --> 10:11.045
Why do you give him the time
of day?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.713
How did he even know where to
find you?

10:12.746 --> 10:13.681
- Josh.
- And you're okay with that?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.349
You can just pick up
right where you left off

10:15.382 --> 10:17.985
whenever he feels like showing
up?

10:18.018 --> 10:20.688
There are things you
don't understand yet.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.723
And I don't like what's
been happening to you.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.725
You're in the practice room day
and night.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.960
It's not healthy.

10:25.993 --> 10:30.998
Look at you, how many hours
a week are you working now?

10:31.332 --> 10:32.800
I do it for you.

10:33.535 --> 10:36.270
I'm going to make things better
for you.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.106
He's your father, you need
him.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.111
I forgot, look what I have.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.115
And it's not your
job to take care of me.

10:48.149 --> 10:49.016
Mom.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.286
A real Broadway show!

10:52.319 --> 10:54.288
Uh, touring, but yeah.

10:57.258 --> 10:59.460
People change, Josh.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.429
Take Barbara, you know, it'll
be fun.

11:02.463 --> 11:04.231
You're coming, right?

11:04.265 --> 11:05.933
I have to work tonight.

11:05.966 --> 11:10.104
Not to his thing,
tomorrow, the competition.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.139
- I have to work, sweetie.
- Okay, my point exactly.

11:12.173 --> 11:15.042
I don't like how much
you're working lately.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.044
I keep telling you, I could get
a job.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.145
It might be nice change.

11:18.179 --> 11:20.481
We're not gonna get into this
again.

11:20.515 --> 11:23.017
Getting through school is your
job,

11:23.050 --> 11:25.986
putting you through school is
mine.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.923
So many rich people go to that
school.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.859
And maybe I could find you
some new clients, you know?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.360
One of them would equal three
Barbaras.

11:33.394 --> 11:35.062
Watch your mouth!

11:35.996 --> 11:40.401
Those people don't need me,
the Barbaras of the world do.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.770
I'm going to win for us.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.975
Come say hi to
Barbara.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.010
Mm, I need to get back to
practice.

11:50.044 --> 11:53.847
Boy, you better get
in there and say hello.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.985
So I understand you're leaving
us.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.987
Hope so, especially now.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.991
Well, you win and you
get to see the whole world.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.426
And take your mom with you.

12:05.459 --> 12:06.961
Yes, that's the point.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.096
Stop, both of you.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.265
If I win, you're coming with
me.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.536
Otherwise, all my hard work
will have been for nothing.

12:14.569 --> 12:16.504
Am I doing mom-guilt properly?

12:16.538 --> 12:18.405
Yes, very well done.

12:18.439 --> 12:19.206
Hmm.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.842
Did you see your father
earlier?

12:21.875 --> 12:25.145
Barbara, how did you know
that was Josh's father?

12:25.179 --> 12:27.114
I'm old, not dumb.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.283
They are the spitting
image of one another.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.818
Yeah, well looks are
all we have in common.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.519
Josh!

12:35.222 --> 12:38.292
Take a shower and go to bed.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.794
All right, peace and blessings.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.464
- Bye, Barbara.
- Good luck, Maestro.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.078
Is it too much to ask

12:58.879 --> 13:03.518
that one of you will be at
the piano when class begins?

13:03.551 --> 13:06.020
A little enthusiasm, people.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.557
Beatrice, Beatrice.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.527
Let's hear your Beethoven.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.162
Yes, Mr. Dempster, yes, sir.

13:58.673 --> 14:01.075
I think we've heard enough.

14:05.647 --> 14:08.382
You all have smartphones, right?

14:10.518 --> 14:14.088
I've been reading about apps
lately.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.023
I've heard they have one
were you can keep track

14:16.056 --> 14:18.593
of how many hours you practice.

14:18.626 --> 14:20.427
Um, would anyone like

14:21.161 --> 14:25.399
to volunteer to help me download
an app?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.300
You, sir.

14:27.535 --> 14:29.470
You can leave now.

14:29.504 --> 14:31.573
You seem so much more
enthusiastic

14:31.606 --> 14:35.442
about this technology
than you do the music.

14:35.476 --> 14:36.477
I'm serious!

14:38.646 --> 14:42.650
I don't have room in this
class for dilettantes!

14:46.420 --> 14:48.155
If any of the rest of you

14:48.188 --> 14:49.691
would rather play with your
phones,

14:49.724 --> 14:52.393
you're free to go with him!

14:52.426 --> 14:54.495
I don't care

14:54.529 --> 14:57.030
if you know how to download an
app!

14:57.064 --> 15:00.100
Just like I don't care if you
have

15:00.134 --> 15:01.669
rehearsals scheduled

15:01.703 --> 15:03.605
or classwork to do.

15:03.638 --> 15:07.642
And I particularly don't care,
if you have a social life!

15:07.675 --> 15:10.978
You're all here for one thing,
the music!

15:11.011 --> 15:13.615
Oh, and for those of you
that have been chosen

15:13.648 --> 15:16.116
for the final round of the
competition,

15:16.150 --> 15:17.519
the only thing you'll be doing

15:17.552 --> 15:20.454
between now and tomorrow is
practicing!

15:20.487 --> 15:23.257
You've never experienced this
kind

15:23.290 --> 15:26.260
of competition with these kinds
of stakes!

15:26.293 --> 15:28.162
Nerves will take over!

15:30.598 --> 15:34.468
London Prize only comes
around once every five years.

15:34.502 --> 15:37.739
So you won't get another shot!

15:37.772 --> 15:39.373
Josh, you're next.

16:25.152 --> 16:30.123
You think you're expressing
innocence, but it's not working.

16:32.527 --> 16:35.597
You need to play this
piece from the viewpoint

16:35.630 --> 16:39.734
of an old man, as though
he's remembering his youth.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.302
Listen to yourself, dig deep.

16:43.036 --> 16:47.107
Let me hear you as if
you were 70, understand?

16:48.743 --> 16:52.814
Now, go practice, you all
know what you need to do.

16:52.847 --> 16:56.316
It's been years to this point,
folks.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.286
And now it's tomorrow night.

16:59.319 --> 17:04.324
If you've made it this far,
you have what it takes to win.

17:04.526 --> 17:05.760
Although I'm starting

17:05.793 --> 17:08.395
to wonder if it's all a fluke.

17:13.801 --> 17:14.669
Come on.

17:29.617 --> 17:30.585
So now we're supposed

17:30.618 --> 17:34.254
to play from the point
of view of an old man.

17:34.288 --> 17:36.456
Sometimes I wonder if
we're in a music school

17:36.490 --> 17:39.326
or is this a real acting school.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.329
Charlotte.

17:46.701 --> 17:50.103
And you're the Josh
I've been hearing about.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.507
Don't worry, it's okay.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.510
Uh, I don't know who
you've been talking to.

17:55.543 --> 17:58.646
Well Zabov is crazy
about you, that's obvious.

18:00.815 --> 18:02.684
You look like you could use a
break.

18:02.717 --> 18:04.752
Wanna hang out, get out for a
while?

18:04.786 --> 18:06.386
Did you hear him?

18:06.420 --> 18:09.791
I can't go anywhere, shouldn't
you be practicing too?

18:09.824 --> 18:11.224
Even if you're not in the
competition,

18:11.258 --> 18:13.528
like Zabov expects it.

18:13.561 --> 18:16.698
Consider that a tip from one
of his most abused students.

18:16.731 --> 18:18.766
So you practice because he
tells you?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.668
I practice because I
wanna win the competition.

18:20.702 --> 18:22.570
I wanna have a career.

18:25.205 --> 18:29.911
So are you coming with me?

18:29.944 --> 18:32.346
You know, I could help you.

18:33.781 --> 18:35.783
- Help me?
- Yes.

19:03.611 --> 19:06.514
Tell you what, why not play
hooky for this afternoon?

19:06.547 --> 19:09.617
Or are you afraid Zabov will
catch you?

19:10.618 --> 19:11.886
You know how crazy things get
around here

19:11.919 --> 19:13.320
before a competition.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.622
That's called practicing.

19:14.656 --> 19:16.791
You see a guy standing on his
head

19:16.824 --> 19:19.226
while he practices, you know
you've been here for too long.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.293
What guy?

19:20.327 --> 19:21.763
You know when you see him,

19:21.796 --> 19:26.567
and when you do, you know
it's time to get out of here.

19:30.437 --> 19:34.307
Well, if you change your
mind, I'll be around.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.748
You know, you're not going
to find what it means

19:40.782 --> 19:42.416
- in the practice room.
- And what exactly...

19:46.854 --> 19:49.590
It's way too tethered,
do you understand?

19:50.892 --> 19:52.492
Ah, Joshua Irving.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.696
A word, please.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.866
What happened in class today?

19:58.900 --> 20:01.502
You seemed distracted.

20:01.536 --> 20:03.270
Nerves, I guess.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.941
If you win this competition,
you'll be in demand.

20:06.974 --> 20:11.946
They won't all be big concerts,
but concerts, nonetheless,

20:11.979 --> 20:14.549
college towns, small cities.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.485
Did you know that there are
people

20:18.519 --> 20:21.923
who don't want to see you
in this competition, Joshua?

20:21.956 --> 20:24.391
You have to want it.

20:24.424 --> 20:28.261
I gave up everything
important for my career.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.363
Are you ready to do that?

20:32.299 --> 20:36.704
And you've got to work twice
as hard because of who you are.

20:36.738 --> 20:37.939
Here you go.

20:37.972 --> 20:40.975
Two totally different
interpretations of your Beethoven.

20:41.008 --> 20:43.511
Listen, get some ideas.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.713
Hey oh, I'm sorry.

20:45.747 --> 20:46.914
I didn't know you had a student
in here.

20:46.948 --> 20:47.749
I'll come back.

20:47.782 --> 20:49.917
No, no, we're winding up right
now.

20:49.951 --> 20:51.018
This is Josh.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.755
He's in the finals tomorrow.

20:53.788 --> 20:55.857
That's quite an honor,
what piece have you chosen?

20:55.890 --> 20:58.325
- Uh, "Pathetique."
- Really?

20:58.358 --> 21:00.728
Well that's quite an intense
piece for a man so young.

21:00.762 --> 21:04.699
He handles it like a
man beyond his years.

21:04.732 --> 21:05.767
You'll never get another
chance

21:05.800 --> 21:07.702
like the one you have tomorrow.

21:07.735 --> 21:09.737
Victor, will I see you tonight?

21:09.771 --> 21:11.606
Ah, crowds aren't my thing.

21:19.013 --> 21:21.481
Uh, thanks for these.

21:21.516 --> 21:24.051
Josh, you may think I'm harsh,

21:25.953 --> 21:29.557
but out there are people
who will judge you harshly

21:29.590 --> 21:33.426
based on everything from your
technique to your skin color.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.696
You've got to be flawless.

21:35.730 --> 21:36.964
You've got to play so

21:36.998 --> 21:40.835
that they have no excuse not to
hire you.

21:40.868 --> 21:42.469
Do you understand?

21:45.540 --> 21:46.406
All right.

22:07.061 --> 22:09.396
Dude, get out!

23:27.074 --> 23:29.844
Hey, Mom, Um, I know you're at
work.

23:29.877 --> 23:33.714
I'm just here practicing,
probably for a few more hours

23:33.748 --> 23:35.016
and then I'm gonna head home
early.

23:35.049 --> 23:37.785
So call me if you need anything.

24:36.210 --> 24:38.779
Hey, your
mom gave me your number.

24:38.813 --> 24:42.149
Uh, said I should call.

24:42.183 --> 24:45.619
You know how convincing she can
be.

24:45.653 --> 24:50.057
Anyway I'm really hoping you'll
come to the opening tonight.

24:50.091 --> 24:52.226
It would mean a lot to me.

24:53.894 --> 24:56.697
I just wanna share this with
you.

25:12.780 --> 25:13.647
Saw him?

25:15.583 --> 25:18.819
Yeah, it's something like
that.

25:18.853 --> 25:20.721
I just needed a break.

25:23.824 --> 25:25.626
What's with the balloons?

25:25.659 --> 25:27.595
They're for my niece.

25:28.362 --> 25:30.131
You know, when I asked you to
hang out

25:30.164 --> 25:34.702
for a while, I mean, it was
longer than just a break.

25:35.636 --> 25:37.038
I have to be somewhere now.

25:37.071 --> 25:40.608
And we're gonna be there a
while.

25:40.641 --> 25:41.308
Why me?

25:42.710 --> 25:43.577
Why not?

25:48.182 --> 25:49.316
Coming or not?

25:58.125 --> 25:59.126
You got a car?

26:31.959 --> 26:34.695
Happy birthday, Amy.

26:34.728 --> 26:36.997
Kazoos, thanks, Aunt Char.

26:37.731 --> 26:41.268
Who are you, are you my aunt's
boyfriend?

26:41.302 --> 26:43.804
Daddy, who's that man?

26:43.838 --> 26:46.874
Well, I hope for his sake,
the balloon delivery man.

26:46.907 --> 26:49.410
- Daddy, you silly.
- Yeah.

26:49.443 --> 26:50.778
Cute, yours?

26:51.513 --> 26:54.882
So how did my sister rope you
into this?

26:54.915 --> 26:56.817
I volunteered.

26:56.851 --> 26:58.018
Huh, that's what he thinks.

26:58.052 --> 27:00.121
Uh, take this.

27:00.154 --> 27:02.022
Um, I'm sorry I don't have a
present.

27:02.056 --> 27:03.257
Oh no worries.

27:03.290 --> 27:04.825
All the presents are donations

27:04.859 --> 27:06.827
for the local animal shelter,
anyway.

27:06.861 --> 27:09.763
- Amy insisted.
- She's a weird child.

27:09.797 --> 27:11.265
Laney.

27:21.475 --> 27:23.277
All right, well, I guess
we'll cover this later.

27:23.310 --> 27:24.712
- Okay.
- Sorry.

27:27.815 --> 27:30.417
- What is she up to?
- Oh, give 'em a break.

27:30.451 --> 27:32.386
- They're a cute couple.
- It's not so fun

27:32.419 --> 27:34.388
when it's your party, is it?

27:34.421 --> 27:37.258
Ah, could you go get the cake,
please.

27:43.898 --> 27:48.836
Uh, go sit over there, come on.

27:53.774 --> 27:55.142
I'm Bryn, by the way.

27:55.176 --> 27:57.044
Oh, sorry, Josh.

27:57.077 --> 27:59.413
And you've met Laney,
our neighbor's daughter.

27:59.446 --> 28:01.982
But she's here so much, she's
like family.

28:02.016 --> 28:04.351
And inside's my husband Milo.

28:05.486 --> 28:07.988
So how long have you known my
sister?

28:08.022 --> 28:09.290
Oh, we just...

28:10.291 --> 28:11.425
Not long.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.661
And do you play piano?

28:12.693 --> 28:17.198
Yeah, actually, apparently
we're at the same conservatory.

28:17.231 --> 28:19.033
"Apparently."

28:19.066 --> 28:22.369
We have a family full of
musicians.

28:22.403 --> 28:25.039
Um, Amy is just starting to take
lessons,

28:25.072 --> 28:26.807
and Milo plays cello.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.109
Though, not so much anymore.

28:29.143 --> 28:32.479
Um, are you competing
tomorrow in the London com...

28:34.949 --> 28:37.484
You like our song, Amy and
I are gonna start a band.

28:37.519 --> 28:39.320
- Oh.
- The Kazoo Keepers.

28:39.353 --> 28:40.321
You get it, you get it?

28:40.354 --> 28:43.824
It's very cute.

28:43.857 --> 28:46.260
So is Josh coming tonight?

28:46.293 --> 28:48.395
Is that within our schedule?

28:48.429 --> 28:50.164
Well, I have to go practice,
actually.

28:50.197 --> 28:51.533
So I don't think that's gonna
happen.

28:51.566 --> 28:55.302
Oh, you could take a
page out of his book, huh?

28:55.336 --> 28:56.870
See, Charlotte's so naturally
gifted,

28:56.904 --> 28:57.871
she takes things like
practicing.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.240
- We have to go.
- For granted.

28:59.273 --> 29:00.374
Look at that.

29:00.407 --> 29:02.343
- Here you go.
- Oh.

29:02.376 --> 29:04.144
But we haven't had cake yet.

29:08.282 --> 29:09.783
Poor kid.

29:13.887 --> 29:14.855
Cake!

29:17.057 --> 29:19.059
So where can I drop you?

29:19.093 --> 29:20.194
We had an understanding.

29:20.227 --> 29:21.996
You said you wouldn't weird out
on me.

29:22.029 --> 29:23.464
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

29:23.497 --> 29:26.300
You say like I said something
I didn't.

29:26.333 --> 29:30.170
Well, we're here now
and it's still early

29:30.204 --> 29:31.338
and I know you want to be alone

29:31.372 --> 29:33.307
and this competition is a big
deal

29:33.340 --> 29:35.142
to you, but I'm gonna be
late if I don't go now

29:35.175 --> 29:36.578
and it's on the way back

29:36.611 --> 29:39.113
to school and I promise
we're gonna go right back

29:39.146 --> 29:42.349
to school and I'll be out of
your hair.

29:44.418 --> 29:46.020
It's on the way?

29:50.858 --> 29:51.892
Okay.

30:18.586 --> 30:20.321
- This my friend Josh.
- Woo!

30:23.390 --> 30:25.326
Right, rock stars, button it
up.

30:25.359 --> 30:26.327
Wanna show Josh what we worked
on?

30:26.360 --> 30:27.494
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

30:30.364 --> 30:31.231
One, two.

31:38.566 --> 31:39.967
Woo, yeah!

31:40.000 --> 31:41.034
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

31:49.143 --> 31:50.712
You composed that?

31:50.745 --> 31:52.312
I mean, then they busted
out with that rock riff.

31:52.346 --> 31:54.214
I don't even understand
where that comes from.

31:54.248 --> 31:57.151
Like how, what made
you put that with jazz?

31:57.184 --> 31:58.620
I put things I like.

31:58.653 --> 32:01.989
Um, like what kind of
music do you listen to?

32:02.022 --> 32:05.058
- What do you mean?
- What's on your playlist?

32:05.092 --> 32:08.128
I don't know, Beethoven, Bach,
Mozart.

32:09.564 --> 32:13.100
What, what's on
yours?

32:13.133 --> 32:16.370
Led Zeppelin, John
Coltrane, Taylor Swift.

32:16.403 --> 32:17.605
Taylor Swift?

32:18.338 --> 32:20.240
You can't live in the
world doing the same thing

32:20.274 --> 32:23.076
over and over and expect to be
inspired.

32:23.110 --> 32:27.314
Besides, Taytay knows how
to get the party started.

32:29.183 --> 32:30.518
So why classical?

32:31.686 --> 32:34.087
What do you mean?

32:34.121 --> 32:37.191
Why are you studying classical
music, why did you pick it?

32:37.224 --> 32:38.959
I don't know, I...

32:41.161 --> 32:42.597
It picked me, I guess.

32:42.630 --> 32:47.635
I mean, I was around age six
when I started taking lessons.

32:48.202 --> 32:50.404
And it came easy in a way.

32:50.437 --> 32:53.675
You know, my anger just seemed
to flow right into the music.

32:53.708 --> 32:56.176
Why were you angry at six?

32:58.513 --> 33:01.381
Um, so what's the deal with
you and those kids anyway?

33:01.415 --> 33:02.684
Like, are you like a teacher?

33:02.717 --> 33:04.552
I volunteer there once a week.

33:04.586 --> 33:06.754
Music helped me when I was a
kid.

33:06.788 --> 33:11.258
Figure it was something small
I could do to bring back.

33:11.291 --> 33:12.694
Besides, it's fun.

33:14.796 --> 33:18.633
Speaking of ways to have fun,
how's working with Zabov?

33:18.666 --> 33:21.435
Huh!

33:21.468 --> 33:23.270
How long have you been with
him?

33:23.303 --> 33:25.339
- Four years.
- Oh my God.

33:25.372 --> 33:26.340
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

33:26.373 --> 33:28.208
Wanna hear something funny?

33:28.242 --> 33:29.209
Okay.

33:29.243 --> 33:32.346
My grandma and Zabov
used to have a thing.

33:32.379 --> 33:33.715
A thing?

33:33.748 --> 33:36.116
And it was serious,
apparently.

33:36.149 --> 33:37.585
She talks about him all the
time,

33:37.619 --> 33:39.821
but she would never admit that.

33:39.854 --> 33:41.723
I think it's hilarious.

33:41.756 --> 33:46.059
It's basically the reason why
I avoided studying with him.

33:46.093 --> 33:48.596
So how's that going anyway?

33:48.630 --> 33:51.431
What, your grandma and Zabov?

33:51.465 --> 33:52.734
You and Zabov.

33:52.767 --> 33:56.538
He's tough.

33:56.571 --> 33:58.105
I need that.

33:58.138 --> 33:59.206
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:59.239 --> 34:01.709
You know, like discipline.

34:03.845 --> 34:04.712
What?

34:05.880 --> 34:08.716
We've been in the same school,
both

34:08.750 --> 34:11.853
about to graduate, and yet
I have never ever seen you.

34:11.886 --> 34:13.855
You've never been to a single
party,

34:13.888 --> 34:16.824
to a single school competition
or show.

34:16.858 --> 34:19.794
I mean, I bet you spent all of
your time in a practice room.

34:19.827 --> 34:21.529
This little 10 by 10 practice
room,

34:21.563 --> 34:23.330
doing nothing but practicing all
day

34:23.363 --> 34:25.165
and eating food delivered to
you.

34:25.198 --> 34:26.500
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's
just

34:26.534 --> 34:27.735
some unpleasant problem with
discipline.

34:27.769 --> 34:30.872
You have me all figured out,
huh?

34:30.905 --> 34:32.840
Well, you missed the part

34:32.874 --> 34:35.877
where I haven't been here all
four years.

34:35.910 --> 34:39.714
Zabov pulled strings
and got me in this year.

34:40.380 --> 34:44.786
Apparently, he felt community
college was beneath me.

34:44.819 --> 34:45.887
Yeah.

34:45.920 --> 34:50.725
Tell you what, the $30
classes weren't beneath me.

34:50.758 --> 34:52.326
Look, it's your first year

34:52.359 --> 34:54.896
at conservatory and you made the
finals.

34:54.929 --> 34:57.164
- You're gonna win.
- Huh.

34:57.197 --> 35:00.668
Well, I guess if having
no life is winning.

35:01.569 --> 35:05.840
So I was right, all of
your time in a practice.

35:10.377 --> 35:11.646
I have to win.

35:13.347 --> 35:14.281
"I have to win."

35:14.314 --> 35:18.118
You'd think piano cured
cancer or something.

35:20.521 --> 35:22.690
You wouldn't understand.

35:22.724 --> 35:24.792
It's all anyone talks about.

35:24.826 --> 35:28.195
There's more to life than music.

35:28.228 --> 35:30.565
Says the girl
with the musical family.

35:30.598 --> 35:33.801
I wish my family understood what
I did.

35:34.501 --> 35:38.706
And you know, they try
to, but really I'm alone.

35:41.341 --> 35:44.545
I'm alone at home, I'm alone in
school.

35:45.980 --> 35:49.383
So my grandma's having
a birthday party tonight.

35:49.416 --> 35:50.417
- Wanna come?
- The one

35:50.450 --> 35:51.619
who's dating Zabov?

35:51.653 --> 35:53.955
- Ah, no, thank you.
- Ew, no.

35:53.988 --> 35:55.657
And that was a million years
ago.

35:55.690 --> 35:59.627
I can't, I have been
out too long as it is.

35:59.661 --> 36:01.729
I think you'd really like her.

36:01.763 --> 36:05.332
Sounds fun, but you know,
discipline.

36:05.365 --> 36:07.669
Yeah, yeah, Zoolander.

36:07.702 --> 36:12.740
Listen, if you're not ready by
now, you will never be ready.

36:12.774 --> 36:16.309
Okay, we've wasted enough time,
let's go.

36:17.512 --> 36:19.179
- What's this?
- Whoa.

36:20.014 --> 36:22.583
"The Art of Ted Urban Grand
Opening,

36:22.617 --> 36:26.353
200, Josh, hope to see
you there, Love Dad."

36:28.422 --> 36:29.590
Whatever.

36:31.859 --> 36:33.728
Back to school, right?

36:38.298 --> 36:41.536
Oh, just one more stop on the
way, okay?

36:45.472 --> 36:47.842
- Where are we?
- Oh, here, here.

36:47.875 --> 36:48.943
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Here?

36:48.976 --> 36:51.411
Yeah, yeah, good.

36:51.445 --> 36:52.847
You're crazy, there's no one
here.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.415
- Gotta see this place.
- Why?

36:56.483 --> 36:57.317
And wouldn't it be better

36:57.350 --> 37:01.022
to come back when it's opened or
never?

37:01.055 --> 37:01.923
Scared?

37:02.724 --> 37:04.692
Yeah, I'm scared of being a
black guy

37:04.726 --> 37:05.960
caught breaking into buildings.

37:05.993 --> 37:09.731
What are you doing?

37:09.764 --> 37:12.834
No breaking, just entering.

37:17.638 --> 37:19.640
Watch your step.

37:19.674 --> 37:21.609
What is this death trap?

37:21.642 --> 37:23.711
Why are you whispering?

37:26.581 --> 37:28.683
This used to be a great concert
hall.

37:28.716 --> 37:32.352
All the best of the
best used to play here.

37:32.385 --> 37:34.856
Now they use it as a revival
church

37:34.889 --> 37:36.891
and not even they can fill the
seats.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.760
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Daniel should be

37:38.793 --> 37:40.695
here somewhere.

37:40.728 --> 37:42.295
Who's Daniel?

37:42.329 --> 37:43.865
He's sort of a caretaker here.

37:43.898 --> 37:47.400
Takes care of the place
and hooligans coming in.

37:47.434 --> 37:50.303
Like us.

37:50.337 --> 37:53.473
I know you're up there,
I hear you breathing.

37:53.508 --> 37:54.575
Come on guys!

37:55.810 --> 37:56.677
Daniel.

37:58.045 --> 38:01.082
Charlie, chaps, ooh, stand
back.

38:01.115 --> 38:04.552
Got bats up here, three of 'em.

38:04.585 --> 38:05.953
I brought a friend.

38:05.987 --> 38:08.623
- Oh, a friend?
- Yes.

38:08.656 --> 38:10.390
Are you a musician too?

38:10.423 --> 38:14.394
The best, he's gonna be
a famous concert pianist.

38:14.427 --> 38:16.697
A pianist, oh, you gotta see
this!

38:16.731 --> 38:18.065
Come on!

38:18.099 --> 38:19.801
Let's go.

38:19.834 --> 38:23.571
Oh, boy, the acoustics are
just perfect.

38:23.604 --> 38:25.072
It's so sweet.

38:25.106 --> 38:29.777
It's a little torn up now, but
there's plans for a remodel.

38:29.811 --> 38:31.546

You know it.

40:15.883 --> 40:17.985
You guys are good!

40:23.624 --> 40:27.895
Look who it is, it's
our Charlie.

40:27.929 --> 40:30.064
- How's your grandma?
- She's good.

40:30.097 --> 40:33.634
Doctors have to keep an eye on
her, but...

40:33.668 --> 40:35.870
- And you are?
- Uh

40:35.903 --> 40:37.605
um, Brendon DuBois.

40:37.638 --> 40:39.774
I mean, sorry, no, you're Mr.
DuBois.

40:39.807 --> 40:40.942
Um, I'm, uh...

40:42.043 --> 40:43.010
- Josh.
- Josh.

40:43.044 --> 40:45.478
Yes, hi, I'm a, I'm a fan.

40:45.513 --> 40:46.747
- You don't say.
- Yes, no.

40:46.781 --> 40:49.150
I was only nine years old the
first time I saw you conduct.

40:49.183 --> 40:52.253
It was All Saints Symphony at
the Hall.

40:52.286 --> 40:55.990
And I just, I used to
pretend to be you.

40:56.023 --> 40:57.124
I would set up stuffed animals

40:57.158 --> 40:58.960
and have them be my orchestra.

40:58.993 --> 41:02.797
So I just, I just love
you in a very platonic

41:04.598 --> 41:07.635
just sort of admiration
kind of, kind of way.

41:09.303 --> 41:11.005
- Well, well, thank you.
- Yeah.

41:11.038 --> 41:12.673
Thank you, why don't
you kids stick around.

41:12.707 --> 41:13.941
We can always use some more
voices.

41:13.975 --> 41:16.777
You sure don't wanna
hear me sing.

41:18.879 --> 41:20.815
- We can't, we have to go.
- Oh, that's right.

41:20.848 --> 41:21.882
The party, I forgot.

41:21.916 --> 41:23.684
I wish I could attend.

41:23.718 --> 41:26.087
Well, look out for her tonight.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.955
- We will.
- Oh, I was talking about you.

41:30.558 --> 41:32.026
- All right, go.
- Pleasure, sir.

41:32.059 --> 41:33.928
Oh my pleasure, thank you.

41:33.961 --> 41:35.596
- Bye, honey, bye, honey.
- Thank you.

41:35.629 --> 41:37.698
- Thank you.
- See you.

41:37.732 --> 41:41.869
Great job, thanks.

Brendan DuBois?

41:49.744 --> 41:50.845
How do you know him?

41:50.878 --> 41:51.979
Seriously, I would give anything

41:52.013 --> 41:53.948
just to be a fly on his wall.

41:53.981 --> 41:56.617
Well, he is right there,
you can break in anytime.

41:56.650 --> 41:59.587
No, seriously, how,
how?

41:59.620 --> 42:01.188
- Grandma.
- She knows him?

42:01.222 --> 42:02.957
She's been there?

42:02.990 --> 42:05.993
They used to play
together a long time ago.

42:06.027 --> 42:07.661
And she's the one having the
birthday?

42:07.695 --> 42:09.063
Yes, every year.

42:09.096 --> 42:10.631
It's a tradition.

42:13.634 --> 42:14.969
So are you coming?

42:24.078 --> 42:25.012
Yes, yes.

42:27.081 --> 42:30.751
Ooh, just one more
stop on the way, okay?

42:33.187 --> 42:34.722
Hey, Charlotte.

42:35.856 --> 42:38.259
Late as always, glad you could
make it.

42:38.292 --> 42:40.027
Hi, come on in.

42:41.362 --> 42:43.597
Welcome to the Kraken Factory.

42:43.631 --> 42:45.866
We do this thing where we,
playing and stuff for each other.

42:45.900 --> 42:48.069
Kind of like the guys over
Ireland has.

42:48.102 --> 42:50.237
Except these are the class
clowns.

42:50.271 --> 42:53.274
Shut up, I prefer to think
of ourselves as open-minded.

42:53.307 --> 42:57.978
Welcome to our somewhat
famous alt classical enclave.

43:01.415 --> 43:02.783
What are you doing?

43:02.817 --> 43:04.819
And what are you talking
about?

43:04.852 --> 43:05.853
Who is he?

43:06.555 --> 43:08.656
- Just a friend.
- Holy crap.

43:08.689 --> 43:09.957
- He's the guy.
- No.

43:09.990 --> 43:11.392
The guy from the competition
tomorrow.

43:11.425 --> 43:13.194
The guy that you've been
stalking.

43:13.227 --> 43:14.328
No, I wasn't stalking him.

43:14.361 --> 43:17.665
Are you purposely trying
to sabotage the poor kid?

43:17.698 --> 43:19.366
I was just curious, don't be
weird.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.970
Hey, hey, what's been going on
with you?

43:25.840 --> 43:29.176
I kinda don't wanna do the
competition.

43:30.377 --> 43:33.247
And I haven't rehearsed like at
all.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.882
Charlotte, you could
win that competition

43:34.915 --> 43:37.017
with your eyes closed and
your fingers chopped off.

43:37.051 --> 43:38.886
This time, it's different.

43:38.919 --> 43:41.322
He's really good, like really
good.

43:41.355 --> 43:43.190
Why do you care about
the competition at all?

43:43.224 --> 43:45.326
You can just quit.

43:45.359 --> 43:46.227
Grandma.

43:47.862 --> 43:50.364
I'm sorry, sweetie, you are so
screwed.

43:54.268 --> 43:55.669
- All right, everyone.
- Woo!

43:55.703 --> 43:56.670
- Yeah!
- Woo!

43:56.704 --> 43:58.739
Let's get this thing rolling.

45:37.938 --> 45:40.908
Woo!

45:40.941 --> 45:43.043
- Woo, all right!
- Woo!

45:43.077 --> 45:44.778
- Yeah!
- All right!

45:45.913 --> 45:47.881
- Let's do it again!
- Yeah!

45:52.286 --> 45:53.420
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

45:56.056 --> 45:57.291
Goodnight.

45:57.324 --> 45:59.460
See you next week.

46:15.342 --> 46:16.578
You ready?

46:16.611 --> 46:18.279
This is so weird.

46:19.246 --> 46:20.114
Why?

46:21.115 --> 46:23.050
I don't know, it just is.

46:25.953 --> 46:29.456
You just haven't gotten to
know it yet.

46:29.490 --> 46:30.357
Come.

46:32.493 --> 46:33.327
Hmm, come.

47:14.068 --> 47:16.270
Are you forgetting something?

47:16.303 --> 47:17.605
Crap, grandma!

47:23.410 --> 47:26.648
- Hello, beautiful lady.
- Oh, Margerie, dear.

47:26.681 --> 47:28.650
- How are you?
- Wonderful.

47:28.683 --> 47:30.417
Happy birthday.

47:30.451 --> 47:33.287
Will you be singing for us
tonight?

47:33.320 --> 47:34.955
Excuse me, dear.

47:34.988 --> 47:36.056
Where's Charlotte?

47:36.090 --> 47:37.525
Oh, you know, she's always
late.

47:37.559 --> 47:39.026
Your husband should be here.

47:39.059 --> 47:40.027
Well, he had to wait for the
sitter.

47:40.060 --> 47:40.994
He'll be here soon.

47:41.028 --> 47:43.230
I don't
need all of this anyway.

47:43.263 --> 47:46.233
Oh, it's your birthday,
we have to celebrate you.

47:46.266 --> 47:48.168
Besides, it's some
unwritten law that we have

47:48.202 --> 47:50.971
to annoy our family members
with cake and presents.

47:51.004 --> 47:52.139
Corinna, Corinna!

47:52.172 --> 47:54.308
- Oh!
- How are you, my sweet?

47:54.341 --> 47:57.010
It is so good to see you, happy
birthday.

47:57.044 --> 48:00.582
I cannot wait to hear you
dazzle us on the keys tonight.

48:00.615 --> 48:02.416
- Uh.
- Bryn, tell her

48:04.184 --> 48:07.388
this is her night and she
can have whatever she wants.

48:07.421 --> 48:10.124
Is everything okay over here?

48:10.157 --> 48:11.992
- What he says?
- You get whatever you want.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.928
Isn't this nice?

48:14.962 --> 48:17.131
Beautiful night, great friends.

48:17.164 --> 48:19.900
Great music and no more protest.

48:58.038 --> 48:59.607
Oh, she's so old.

48:59.641 --> 49:01.543
- Grandma.
- That is so delicious.

49:01.576 --> 49:03.177
I dare you to throw it out.

49:03.210 --> 49:04.546
Someone I want you to meet.

49:04.579 --> 49:05.446
Oh!

49:06.514 --> 49:08.482
This is my friend Josh.

49:08.516 --> 49:10.618
Oh, yes, Josh the pianist.

49:10.652 --> 49:12.687
Uh, happy to meet you, ma'am.

49:12.720 --> 49:15.523
Please, ma'am is not
necessary.

49:16.390 --> 49:20.294
So you are a Victor Zabov's new
student.

49:20.327 --> 49:23.096
The next one in line for
all the accolades, yes?

49:24.298 --> 49:26.233
I'm surprised he let you out
tonight.

49:26.266 --> 49:30.237
He usually keeps very close
guard on all his musicians.

49:30.270 --> 49:33.741
Hothouse musicians, we used to
call them.

49:33.775 --> 49:37.044
So this is Charlie's idea, I
presume.

49:38.412 --> 49:40.080
Gotta hand it to the girl.

49:40.113 --> 49:41.482
She's a wily one.

49:52.827 --> 49:54.796
It's my birthday.

49:54.829 --> 49:57.799
And I want to hear my
granddaughter play.

49:57.832 --> 50:00.200
Hmm, I'm not getting up there.

50:00.234 --> 50:01.101
Why not?

50:02.336 --> 50:04.438
Okay, I'll tell you what

50:04.471 --> 50:07.274
if that bartender does a
cartwheel before she gets back

50:07.307 --> 50:10.578
to the bar, you'll get up on
that stage.

50:11.679 --> 50:13.247
Wait for it, wait for it.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.682
It's gonna happen.

50:17.685 --> 50:19.086
It did not happen, okay.

50:21.856 --> 50:23.223
I'll tell you what.

50:23.257 --> 50:24.692
Go up there, I go up there.

50:24.726 --> 50:26.393
Oh, please.

50:26.426 --> 50:31.131
The silly arguing, both of
you, you're musicians, yes?

50:31.164 --> 50:33.267
Get up on that stage and play.

50:38.138 --> 50:39.406
You know what?

50:42.877 --> 50:43.745
Push.

50:44.646 --> 50:45.513
Yeah.

50:47.214 --> 50:51.786
Bravo, oh, bravo.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.527
Come on Mr. Beethoven.

50:59.561 --> 51:02.129
Put your fingers on the
keys and wiggle them.

53:02.382 --> 53:03.250
Bravo!

53:15.797 --> 53:17.397
Yes!

53:18.132 --> 53:21.268
- Did that just happen?
- Yes, it did.

53:21.301 --> 53:24.839
That was unreal.

53:24.872 --> 53:26.941
Not too shabby, Mr. Beethoven.

53:26.974 --> 53:29.376
That's my roommate's
girlfriend calls me.

53:29.409 --> 53:31.612
She said it's 'cause I'm
a slob like Beethoven.

53:31.646 --> 53:34.347
Oh, really?

53:34.381 --> 53:37.852
You look like a young Denzel
Washington when you laugh.

53:37.885 --> 53:39.419
"We didn't land on Plymouth
Rock!

53:39.453 --> 53:40.621
Plymouth Rock landed on us!"

53:40.655 --> 53:43.490
It's Denzel.

53:43.524 --> 53:44.926
As it's Malcolm X.

53:46.694 --> 53:50.330
- Is that a movie?
- Oh, Charlotte.

53:50.363 --> 53:51.298
No, no, no.

53:53.067 --> 53:56.470
I've seen every Denzel
movie at least six times.

53:56.504 --> 53:58.438
And not just because he's hot.

54:13.888 --> 54:15.857
- I...
- What is it?

54:15.890 --> 54:16.924
I, I'm sorry.

54:16.958 --> 54:18.059
- Did I...
- No.

54:18.092 --> 54:18.893
- Should I not have?
- No.

54:18.926 --> 54:21.863
I'm not good at
this.

54:21.896 --> 54:25.066
It's me, I shouldn't
have kept you out so long.

54:25.099 --> 54:29.670
You have an important day
tomorrow and you should go.

54:29.704 --> 54:32.305
Yeah, actually, yeah.

54:32.339 --> 54:33.541
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh.

54:33.574 --> 54:34.909
- Yes.
- Um, okay.

54:36.110 --> 54:37.979
I'll just go grab a water.

54:38.012 --> 54:40.815
- Sure, yes.
- For the long bus ride home.

54:52.727 --> 54:54.095
Really been a rough night in
there.

54:54.128 --> 54:56.831
- Thank you.
- You know, heroes.

54:56.864 --> 54:59.600
Mm.

55:01.869 --> 55:04.605
Are you out here fake smoking
again?

55:11.378 --> 55:12.713
Some show, huh?

55:14.481 --> 55:17.484
Well maybe we should go
easier on her, she is only 20.

55:17.518 --> 55:19.620
Old enough to know what she's
doing.

55:19.654 --> 55:20.555
You see it, right?

55:20.588 --> 55:21.656
She's doing the same thing to
that kid.

55:21.689 --> 55:24.692
You know what, maybe this
time it'll be different.

55:24.725 --> 55:26.594
People don't change.

55:28.729 --> 55:31.498
Are you forgetting that
maybe if things hadn't happened

55:31.532 --> 55:34.467
that way we wouldn't have
happened?

55:36.037 --> 55:39.574
Another drink, we got a
sitter.

55:39.607 --> 55:41.776
Certainly that's cause for
celebration.

55:46.814 --> 55:48.149
Ah, two waters please.

55:48.182 --> 55:49.951
- You bet.
- Thank you.

55:49.984 --> 55:52.086
There he is, man of the hour.

55:53.521 --> 55:54.622
That's nice playing.

55:54.655 --> 55:55.957
Thank you, thanks.

55:55.990 --> 55:58.826
Did you ever do the
Beethoven cello sonatas?

55:58.860 --> 56:00.695
No, but I'd love to.

56:00.728 --> 56:02.163
- Mm.
- Anything else, gentlemen?

56:02.196 --> 56:03.831
- No, we're okay.
- What are we drinking?

56:03.865 --> 56:06.000
Yours truly did

56:06.033 --> 56:08.569
many years ago at the
conservatory.

56:08.603 --> 56:11.038
My accompanist was just a kid.

56:11.072 --> 56:12.405
What was that like?

56:12.439 --> 56:13.674
Humiliating!

56:15.877 --> 56:17.945
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

56:17.979 --> 56:19.046
- Uh.
- We just started the first

56:19.080 --> 56:20.948
movement and she took off like a
bat out

56:20.982 --> 56:23.017
of hell, Just ramrodded
through the whole thing.

56:23.050 --> 56:24.619
Just pure ego.

56:24.652 --> 56:26.587
She was a real piece of work,
that one.

56:26.621 --> 56:28.589
I got slammed by the papers, but
the kid,

56:28.623 --> 56:30.892
she gets rave reviews, they
loved her.

56:30.925 --> 56:33.895
They just can't wait to
see your next appearance.

56:33.928 --> 56:35.529
She was just a kid, right?

56:35.563 --> 56:37.865
I'm sure she didn't mean
to, you know, sabotage...

56:37.899 --> 56:39.432
Just watch yourself.

56:39.466 --> 56:41.836
And what you see is not what you
get.

56:41.869 --> 56:43.704
We will have no crying in our
beers

56:43.738 --> 56:45.973
- at this party, thank you.
- Mm.

56:46.007 --> 56:48.676
Oh, and they just put out
scallops wrapped in bacon.

56:48.709 --> 56:51.579
Speaking my language.

56:51.612 --> 56:54.081
Here is to Beethoven ala bacon.

56:56.751 --> 56:59.020
Mm, this vodka's gone bad.

56:59.053 --> 57:03.524
Taste like water.

57:03.557 --> 57:05.726
Uh, yeah, excuse him.

57:05.760 --> 57:06.961
Yeah, it's okay.

57:06.994 --> 57:10.231
Um, nice performance earlier.

57:10.264 --> 57:13.601
I didn't expect that, I thought
you were strictly classical.

57:13.634 --> 57:16.570
Well, tonight's been
different.

57:16.604 --> 57:18.773
This whole day has.

57:18.806 --> 57:20.207
Are your parents coming?

57:20.241 --> 57:23.144
I'd love to meet the
people who raised that one.

57:23.177 --> 57:25.546
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say
something wrong?

57:25.579 --> 57:27.515
No, no, it's okay.

57:27.548 --> 57:29.951
Um, they're no longer with us.

57:30.985 --> 57:32.853
There was a car accident.

57:32.887 --> 57:36.489
I don't think Charlie even
remembers them.

57:36.524 --> 57:38.693
She never talks about them.

57:39.927 --> 57:40.928
I'm sorry.

57:42.596 --> 57:45.533
Now she's the only one
who ever really got Charlie.

57:45.566 --> 57:47.702
- Your grandmother?
- Yeah.

57:48.769 --> 57:49.870
I mean, when Mom and Dad passed,

57:49.904 --> 57:51.539
I was already pretty much out

57:51.572 --> 57:53.908
of the house and Charlie
was still a toddler.

57:53.941 --> 57:55.643
Well that explains the accent.

57:55.676 --> 57:56.978
Oh, yeah.

57:57.011 --> 57:59.146
Well, and Grandma raised
Charlie,

57:59.180 --> 58:01.048
but I think she picked up the
accent

58:01.082 --> 58:03.584
on purpose to be closer to her.

58:03.617 --> 58:05.219
She's pretty great.

58:07.321 --> 58:08.589
On the piano.

58:09.590 --> 58:11.192
On the piano, yeah.

58:12.927 --> 58:14.628
Look, Josh, I know it's none

58:14.662 --> 58:17.131
of my business, but
that London competition.

58:17.164 --> 58:18.632
Uh, don't remind me.

58:18.666 --> 58:20.267
My teacher would yank
me from the competition

58:20.301 --> 58:22.770
- if he knew I was here.
- So you do know that...

58:22.803 --> 58:24.572
- No, ooh, hi.
- Mm.

58:24.605 --> 58:25.773
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:25.806 --> 58:27.808
Okay, well we'll talk later.

58:27.842 --> 58:28.976
- Okay.
- Come, you.

58:29.010 --> 58:30.711
- All right.
- Let's, let's, let's...

58:30.745 --> 58:31.912
He's a good guy.

58:31.946 --> 58:33.914
Hello everyone, hi, um...

58:33.948 --> 58:34.882
Can I get two more
waters, please, sorry.

58:34.915 --> 58:37.284
I would like to thank
our guest of honor.

58:37.318 --> 58:38.953
And thank you all for coming.

58:38.986 --> 58:41.155
Our guest of honor is Grandma
Corinna.

58:44.725 --> 58:47.294
I think as a thank you gift for
us,

58:47.328 --> 58:50.765
for her birthday, she should
sing us or play us something.

58:50.798 --> 58:52.166
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

58:52.199 --> 58:54.201
Yes!

58:54.235 --> 58:57.304
Those among the crowd,
come on, some cheering!

58:57.338 --> 59:00.975
Yes, yes, yes!

59:01.008 --> 59:02.543
Come on, come on!

Thank you.

1:00:56.490 --> 1:00:59.126
I must know a hundred melodies,

1:01:00.828 --> 1:01:04.064
but the last few years I've been
playing

1:01:04.098 --> 1:01:06.367
the same ones over and over.

1:01:07.134 --> 1:01:12.239
I sit at the piano and it's
the same melodies all the time.

1:01:12.273 --> 1:01:13.874
I don't know if I was trying

1:01:13.908 --> 1:01:17.912
to perfect them or if I'm
just a creature of habit,

1:01:17.945 --> 1:01:21.415
but then my hands couldn't
stretch as far.

1:01:22.950 --> 1:01:26.687
And then it became
difficult to play at all.

1:01:27.922 --> 1:01:31.125
And it's hard to admit
that even here on my,

1:01:31.158 --> 1:01:35.029
hmm, birthday.

1:01:35.062 --> 1:01:39.500
When you love something
and then one day it's gone,

1:01:39.534 --> 1:01:44.205
you realize that maybe
it's good that you decided

1:01:44.238 --> 1:01:48.976
to have a life outside the
music, but I have no regrets.

1:01:50.311 --> 1:01:51.979
I have lived fully.

1:01:53.113 --> 1:01:55.049
And I have loved fully.

1:01:56.217 --> 1:02:01.422
And now my Charlie is going
to take over in my footsteps

1:02:01.822 --> 1:02:04.491
and make her grandma so proud.

1:02:05.527 --> 1:02:09.163
Congratulations to
Charlotte and wish her well

1:02:09.196 --> 1:02:11.932
for her big competition
tomorrow.

1:02:19.273 --> 1:02:20.774
I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

1:02:20.808 --> 1:02:22.009
Why is he here?

1:02:22.042 --> 1:02:23.377
I think it's because of
grandma.

1:02:23.410 --> 1:02:24.979
No, no, you said they weren't
a thing.

1:02:25.012 --> 1:02:27.181
- They're not.
- Okay, I have to leave

1:02:27.214 --> 1:02:29.216
before he sees me here,
but my bag is inside,

1:02:29.250 --> 1:02:33.220
my bike is out front,
what am I supposed...

1:02:33.254 --> 1:02:34.355
There's something else.

1:02:34.388 --> 1:02:36.090
What, what else?

1:02:36.123 --> 1:02:37.491
Josh, I need to tell you
something.

1:02:37.525 --> 1:02:40.127
What, what, Charlotte, what?

1:02:41.462 --> 1:02:43.964
There you are, missy.

1:02:43.998 --> 1:02:48.202
I don't appreciate you
forcing me up on that stage.

1:02:48.235 --> 1:02:49.803
And you, where are you
off to in such a hurry?

1:02:49.837 --> 1:02:50.904
I have to go.

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:51.772
Zabov is gonna pull me

1:02:51.805 --> 1:02:54.041
from the competition if he sees
me here.

1:02:54.074 --> 1:02:56.343
That's absolutely correct.

1:02:57.878 --> 1:03:00.881
Victor Zabov, nothing has
changed.

1:03:01.583 --> 1:03:03.884
You're still an ass.

1:03:03.917 --> 1:03:05.819
That's crass, Corinna.

1:03:05.853 --> 1:03:07.988
If you don't let your
musicians live a little,

1:03:08.022 --> 1:03:10.357
how are they going to bring
any life into their music?

1:03:10.391 --> 1:03:12.092
He's a good teacher,
Corinna, he's just trying-

1:03:12.126 --> 1:03:14.161
- I can handle my own battles,
Josh.

1:03:14.194 --> 1:03:17.599
Oh, you said something he
has always been able to handle.

1:03:17.632 --> 1:03:18.600
His battles.

1:03:18.633 --> 1:03:21.835
Let me take you home,
I have a car waiting.

1:03:21.869 --> 1:03:23.037
Why?

1:03:23.070 --> 1:03:25.472
So you can lock me in a room
like you do your musicians?

1:03:25.507 --> 1:03:27.408
Not letting them live their
lives.

1:03:27.441 --> 1:03:29.476
I do that for their own good.

1:03:29.511 --> 1:03:31.312
Joshua wouldn't have gotten this
far,

1:03:31.345 --> 1:03:34.014
if it wasn't for strict
discipline.

1:03:34.048 --> 1:03:36.584
And now he's playing
for one of the greatest

1:03:36.618 --> 1:03:39.386
- competitions in the-
- Oh, posh!

1:03:39.420 --> 1:03:41.455
It doesn't matter who you're
playing for

1:03:41.488 --> 1:03:43.023
or what you're playing.

1:03:43.057 --> 1:03:46.260
A musician has to connect
with his audience.

1:03:46.293 --> 1:03:49.096
I don't care if you play
every single note perfectly.

1:03:49.129 --> 1:03:53.200
If you don't have anything
to say, don't waste my time.

1:03:53.233 --> 1:03:56.236
And you, what you did in there
tonight,

1:03:56.270 --> 1:03:59.006
now that was something special.

1:04:00.107 --> 1:04:01.442
- Oh, oh!
- Grandma!

1:04:02.309 --> 1:04:05.913
Corinna, are you all right?

1:04:05.946 --> 1:04:07.549
I told you I was gonna take you
home.

1:04:07.582 --> 1:04:08.916
Now I'll take you to the
hospital.

1:04:08.949 --> 1:04:12.086
Lift her up.

1:04:12.119 --> 1:04:15.489
- Josh, grab my purse.
- Hold her, hold her.

1:04:15.523 --> 1:04:17.458
Come on, go ahead, go.

1:04:17.491 --> 1:04:18.425
Go, go, go.

1:04:21.195 --> 1:04:23.263
Amy is sound asleep.

1:04:23.297 --> 1:04:25.899
I don't think she missed us one
bit.

1:04:25.933 --> 1:04:28.135
Gosh, seeing those kids tonight

1:04:28.168 --> 1:04:30.137
reminded me of how I used to be
with us.

1:04:30.170 --> 1:04:31.271
When was the last time we were
all goofy

1:04:31.305 --> 1:04:33.173
and playful like that?

1:04:34.509 --> 1:04:35.376
Baby, hey,

1:04:37.679 --> 1:04:39.547
it happened, it's over.

1:04:39.581 --> 1:04:42.449
Besides, she's not the reason
you stopped playing, remember?

1:04:42.483 --> 1:04:44.451
Come on, why did you stop
playing?

1:04:44.485 --> 1:04:46.153
Because I quit auditioning.

1:04:46.186 --> 1:04:47.054
Why?

1:04:48.021 --> 1:04:50.991
'Cause that curmudgeon
conductor said my bow work

1:04:51.024 --> 1:04:52.527
looked like a hippo with
arthritis.

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:54.228
Oh, come on, why?

1:04:55.496 --> 1:04:57.364
'Cause I was losing my soul.

1:04:57.398 --> 1:05:00.000
And it became about winning.

1:05:11.679 --> 1:05:13.447
Do you regret our life together?

1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:14.415
What, no.

1:05:16.250 --> 1:05:17.985
No, I love our life.

1:05:20.254 --> 1:05:21.321
You're right.

1:05:27.294 --> 1:05:28.228
I love you.

1:05:34.268 --> 1:05:37.705
Remember when it used to be
fun?

1:05:37.739 --> 1:05:39.507
No!

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:40.708
Yes, come on, play with me.

1:05:40.742 --> 1:05:42.476
- No!
- Come on!

1:05:42.510 --> 1:05:44.478
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

1:05:44.512 --> 1:05:47.114
No, no, please, turn it off.

1:05:48.115 --> 1:05:49.183
No.

1:05:49.216 --> 1:05:50.951
- Play with me.
- No.

Let's get you to bed.

1:07:21.108 --> 1:07:22.744
I still think she should see a
doctor.

1:07:22.777 --> 1:07:24.478
She needs an x-ray.

1:07:24.512 --> 1:07:26.179
I'll call first thing in
morning.

1:07:26.213 --> 1:07:28.348
Stop, all of you!

1:07:28.382 --> 1:07:31.218
Can't an old woman have some
peace?

1:08:03.651 --> 1:08:05.787
So last time something
like this happened,

1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:09.289
the doctor said it might
have been a mini-stroke.

1:08:09.323 --> 1:08:10.424
He said it could come up again

1:08:10.457 --> 1:08:14.261
with no warning, but she
keeps saying this was nothing.

1:08:14.294 --> 1:08:16.296
She'll go to the doctor
tomorrow

1:08:16.330 --> 1:08:18.666
if I have to take her myself.

1:08:19.701 --> 1:08:21.101
Stubborn woman.

1:08:21.936 --> 1:08:26.541
What I want to know is what's
going on between you two?

1:08:26.574 --> 1:08:29.376
Don't you care for your
careers, your music?

1:08:29.409 --> 1:08:30.545
I have been studying non-stop.

1:08:30.578 --> 1:08:31.679
- I convinced him to go.
- For four weeks.

1:08:31.713 --> 1:08:32.547
- It wasn't even his idea.
- This is the first night

1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:33.380
- I left, okay?
- And he was practicing.

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:34.048
- I'm sorry.
- And I was helping him.

1:08:34.082 --> 1:08:36.784
- I messed up.
- Silence!

1:08:38.385 --> 1:08:40.387
Josh, I am disappointed.

1:08:42.356 --> 1:08:44.324
You actually had what it takes
to win.

1:08:44.358 --> 1:08:47.494
And then you go and do
something stupid like this.

1:08:47.528 --> 1:08:48.696
Did you really think the way

1:08:48.730 --> 1:08:52.332
to win was to sabotage another
competitor?

1:08:53.433 --> 1:08:54.468
Wait, what?

1:08:54.501 --> 1:08:57.437
If you just worked as
hard seated at your piano

1:08:57.471 --> 1:08:59.306
as you do distracting Josh,

1:08:59.339 --> 1:09:01.909
you'd have been the sure winner.

1:09:01.943 --> 1:09:04.545
And you, after our talk today,

1:09:05.580 --> 1:09:08.950
I don't understand this
behavior.

1:09:08.983 --> 1:09:13.521
I put too much faith in
you.

1:09:16.557 --> 1:09:18.291
Now go, both of you.

1:09:19.727 --> 1:09:21.194
Get out of here!

1:09:26.266 --> 1:09:28.468
I'll stay here for Corinna.

1:09:37.979 --> 1:09:40.515
Why won't you unlock?

1:09:40.548 --> 1:09:42.650
Josh, please, I wanted to tell
you.

1:09:42.684 --> 1:09:43.785
I tried to tell you.

1:09:43.818 --> 1:09:46.921
When, like when did you
try to tell me, Charlotte?

1:09:46.954 --> 1:09:48.156
When you, when you made me think
that

1:09:48.188 --> 1:09:50.625
I was somehow special and you
wanted to hang out with me?

1:09:50.658 --> 1:09:52.259
When you, when you used me

1:09:52.292 --> 1:09:53.260
as your escort around town all
day?

1:09:53.293 --> 1:09:54.762
- Like when?
- You can still win.

1:09:54.796 --> 1:09:57.732
Oh my God, how long have
you been in the competition?

1:09:57.765 --> 1:09:58.900
And you're one of the finalists?

1:09:58.933 --> 1:10:00.300
Josh, please, you can still
win.

1:10:00.333 --> 1:10:01.969
So was that your plan all
along?

1:10:02.003 --> 1:10:03.503
To, to distract me, right?

1:10:03.538 --> 1:10:06.473
Like throw me off my game.

1:10:06.507 --> 1:10:08.308
- Was that your plan?
- Yes.

1:10:08.341 --> 1:10:09.944
- Yes, at first, but-
- And the girl Milo

1:10:09.977 --> 1:10:14.281
told me about that stole
his moment, that was you.

1:10:14.314 --> 1:10:15.282
I didn't want to believe it,

1:10:15.315 --> 1:10:17.317
that this girl that I...

1:10:19.419 --> 1:10:20.220
- That you what?
- Forget...

1:10:20.253 --> 1:10:22.289
- What, Josh?
- It doesn't matter.

1:10:22.322 --> 1:10:23.725
Okay, not anymore.

1:10:24.525 --> 1:10:27.829
Dammit, Charlotte, you put
my entire life in jeopardy.

1:10:27.862 --> 1:10:29.463
Everything I've worked for!

1:10:29.496 --> 1:10:31.599
Runner-up gets nothing, okay?

1:10:31.632 --> 1:10:33.868
If I don't win this, then all
the lessons,

1:10:33.901 --> 1:10:35.670
all the money that my mom put

1:10:35.703 --> 1:10:37.638
in to pay for those lessons, for
nothing!

1:10:37.672 --> 1:10:40.007
Because it isn't about
winning.

1:10:40.041 --> 1:10:42.476
Do you really
wanna go there right now?

1:10:42.510 --> 1:10:44.011
I'm sorry, it's just,

1:10:44.045 --> 1:10:46.480
everyone was talking about how
perfect

1:10:46.514 --> 1:10:49.282
your technique was, how you
were everyone's favorite.

1:10:49.316 --> 1:10:52.319
Because I spend my
life in a practice room!

1:10:52.352 --> 1:10:54.956
I have done nothing but
work to get to this moment!

1:10:54.989 --> 1:10:57.992
You could have done the
same thing instead of...

1:10:58.025 --> 1:11:01.361
You couldn't even tell me
you were in the finals.

1:11:01.394 --> 1:11:05.398
Do you really think that
would have changed anything?

1:11:05.432 --> 1:11:06.834
Maybe, I just...

1:11:07.835 --> 1:11:09.369
- Josh, please.
- Stop, stop it!

1:11:09.402 --> 1:11:11.873
Charlotte, just leave me alone.

1:11:12.807 --> 1:11:15.042
Okay, this day was a mistake.

1:11:15.076 --> 1:11:18.946
My life, my plans,
everything's all jacked up!

1:11:20.815 --> 1:11:22.016
You have no idea what it's like

1:11:22.049 --> 1:11:23.751
for me here at this white-ass
school!

1:11:23.785 --> 1:11:26.721
You think people are clamoring
to hire people like me?

1:11:26.754 --> 1:11:28.589
People like you, but you're so
talented.

1:11:28.623 --> 1:11:31.458
I can't make a single mistake.

1:11:31.491 --> 1:11:33.995
Not one, you have no
idea what that's like.

1:11:34.028 --> 1:11:35.395
Yes, I do, I'm a woman.

1:11:35.428 --> 1:11:37.064
It's not the same!

1:11:37.098 --> 1:11:39.066
Like you saying that just proves

1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:40.101
you don't know what you're
talking about.

1:11:40.134 --> 1:11:41.869
You just, you just coast
through,

1:11:41.903 --> 1:11:43.738
not taking anything seriously,
just...

1:11:43.771 --> 1:11:46.007
And somehow you got into the
finals

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:48.441
of one of the most prestigious
competitions in the worst!

1:11:48.475 --> 1:11:51.411
Why is everyone making
such a big deal out of it?

1:11:51.444 --> 1:11:53.614
Everyone's gonna know who's
Beethoven in a hundred years,

1:11:53.648 --> 1:11:57.018
will they know who Josh Irving
is?

1:11:57.051 --> 1:11:59.554
Oh, shit, Josh, I didn't
mean it like that.

1:11:59.587 --> 1:12:00.453
Josh!

1:12:01.122 --> 1:12:03.057
No, I'm sorry, I meant all of
us.

1:12:03.090 --> 1:12:07.360
You are not the person
I thought you were.

1:12:07.394 --> 1:12:08.796
Neither are you.

1:12:11.398 --> 1:12:13.801
You act like everyone is
abandoning you,

1:12:13.835 --> 1:12:15.703
but you're the one who choose
all of this.

1:12:15.736 --> 1:12:18.139
You choose to spend your
life in a practice room.

1:12:18.172 --> 1:12:20.541
You choose to think that
you're somehow different

1:12:20.575 --> 1:12:21.843
so you couldn't have any
friends.

1:12:21.876 --> 1:12:23.410
And you choose to think

1:12:23.443 --> 1:12:25.813
that you have to be
perfect to have a career.

1:12:25.847 --> 1:12:27.715
I don't know what the
thing with your father is,

1:12:27.748 --> 1:12:29.884
but at least you have one.

1:12:33.588 --> 1:12:36.924
- What about your bike?
- I'll take the bus!

1:14:19.527 --> 1:14:22.196
I'd never seen her happier,
hmm.

1:14:23.597 --> 1:14:25.933
Mm, you were her whole world.

1:14:27.001 --> 1:14:28.803
You were the light of her life,
man.

1:14:28.836 --> 1:14:32.840
After you were born, she
didn't need anything.

1:14:32.873 --> 1:14:34.608
Not her art, not me.

1:14:37.211 --> 1:14:40.982
You were hardly
there.

1:14:41.015 --> 1:14:43.684
You don't know what she needed.

1:14:45.286 --> 1:14:47.487
I know, and I'm sorry.

1:14:53.227 --> 1:14:55.563
You know, this photograph,

1:14:56.230 --> 1:15:00.968
this photograph is the thing
that got me painting again.

1:15:02.036 --> 1:15:03.871
Deepened my love for art.

1:15:03.904 --> 1:15:06.073
Your mom and I had just come
from a little flea market

1:15:06.107 --> 1:15:09.110
and I bought her a used
Roller-flex.

1:15:10.044 --> 1:15:12.113
And I snapped that on the fly.

1:15:12.146 --> 1:15:15.783
And later that night, she told
me she was pregnant with you.

1:15:15.816 --> 1:15:17.284
Why are you here?

1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:22.823
Why are you suddenly hellbound
on staying?

1:15:23.657 --> 1:15:27.061
I had an opportunity, I had to
leave.

1:15:27.995 --> 1:15:30.664
I'm not saying it's right,

1:15:30.698 --> 1:15:32.767
but it was what I felt I had to
do.

1:15:34.335 --> 1:15:37.238
But looking back, all the
traveling, all the places,

1:15:37.271 --> 1:15:39.573
all the running around, trying
to get the perfect shot,

1:15:39.607 --> 1:15:40.474
the perfect sunset.

1:15:40.509 --> 1:15:43.577
I would trade all that in a
heartbeat

1:15:43.611 --> 1:15:47.715
to get back the moments I
lost with you and your mom.

1:15:47.748 --> 1:15:50.751
I didn't know it then, but I do
now.

1:15:52.053 --> 1:15:54.255
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

1:15:54.288 --> 1:15:56.090
Like tonight, this competition,

1:15:56.123 --> 1:15:59.860
whatever happens, I'm
gonna be here for you.

1:16:00.795 --> 1:16:03.330
If moving mom away, is what you

1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:09.904
and she wants, then
I'll go wherever you go,

1:16:13.207 --> 1:16:16.744
'cause it's not about where I am
anymore,

1:16:18.145 --> 1:16:19.980
about where you are.

1:16:20.014 --> 1:16:22.750
And I'm gonna prove that to you.

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:30.357
If you knew how hard
mom worked all these years

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:35.362
while you were out living it up.

1:16:35.396 --> 1:16:37.898
All pompous with your travel log
photos

1:16:37.932 --> 1:16:40.334
and drinking wine with
these pretentious idiots

1:16:40.367 --> 1:16:43.904
who think you're some kind of
genius!

1:16:43.938 --> 1:16:47.007
And then you come here and
pretend

1:16:47.041 --> 1:16:51.745
to be interested in what I'm
doing every couple of years.

1:16:51.779 --> 1:16:54.315
You have no idea what it's like.

1:16:55.816 --> 1:16:57.651
You don't care about me

1:16:57.685 --> 1:17:01.255
or my music or about my goals
to move mom away from here.

1:17:01.288 --> 1:17:02.957
It's all about you!

1:17:06.894 --> 1:17:08.062
Still.

1:17:18.973 --> 1:17:22.309
Hey grandma, shouldn't
you be at the doctors?

1:17:22.343 --> 1:17:24.145
I'm back, I'm fine.

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.014
I told you.

1:17:29.016 --> 1:17:30.184
Where is Zabov?

1:17:30.217 --> 1:17:33.420
He went to buy
some groceries to make lunch.

1:17:33.454 --> 1:17:35.122
Stubborn old fool.

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:40.427
What you did last night-

1:17:40.461 --> 1:17:42.263
- I know, I'm sorry.

1:17:45.766 --> 1:17:47.835
What you did was wrong.

1:17:48.903 --> 1:17:51.338
You're better than that.

1:17:51.372 --> 1:17:53.240
But I take some fault.

1:17:55.042 --> 1:17:56.944
I pressed you too hard to win.

1:17:56.977 --> 1:17:58.445
No, Grandma, it's not...

1:17:58.479 --> 1:18:01.815
I forgot what it's like to be
young.

1:18:03.117 --> 1:18:06.820
Have a life of opportunity
in front of you.

1:18:06.854 --> 1:18:08.155
In love.

1:18:08.189 --> 1:18:09.990
I'm not in love.

1:18:10.024 --> 1:18:11.058
You are so head over heels,

1:18:11.091 --> 1:18:14.728
you can't walk unless
you're doing a handstand.

1:18:14.762 --> 1:18:16.764
I was so worried about your
future.

1:18:16.797 --> 1:18:19.466
I could only see that
competition.

1:18:20.569 --> 1:18:25.839
It was the love of the music,
not the fame, not the money.

1:18:26.874 --> 1:18:28.876
It was always the music.

1:18:29.944 --> 1:18:34.148
When I watched you and
Josh up there last night,

1:18:35.816 --> 1:18:40.020
a new fire got lit in this
old dusty heart of mine.

1:18:41.488 --> 1:18:44.091
Oh, I haven't felt that since-

1:18:44.959 --> 1:18:46.327
- Grandpa?

1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:47.428
No, before.

1:18:49.029 --> 1:18:52.099
Do ever regret not taking a
chance?

1:19:00.341 --> 1:19:03.010
I'll meet you in the kitchen.

1:19:10.351 --> 1:19:15.022
Sometimes, but then I wouldn't
have you or your sister.

1:19:23.831 --> 1:19:27.001
You have to figure out
what it is you want,

1:19:27.034 --> 1:19:29.336
not what the rest of us want.

1:19:29.370 --> 1:19:32.574
Everyone is just trying to
figure out their own shit.

1:19:32.607 --> 1:19:33.474
Grandma!

1:19:34.875 --> 1:19:38.412
Yes, your grandma
curses on occasion too.

1:19:38.445 --> 1:19:40.515
Practice, don't practice.

1:19:41.282 --> 1:19:44.151
I'm going to get myself some
lunch.

1:20:00.301 --> 1:20:02.036
I would've stayed.

1:20:03.370 --> 1:20:04.238
I know.

1:20:05.906 --> 1:20:07.308
That's why I left.

1:20:15.650 --> 1:20:17.217
Hey, package for Josh Irving.

1:20:17.251 --> 1:20:19.486
- Yeah, that's me.
- All right.

1:20:19.521 --> 1:20:21.455
Just sign here, please.

1:20:25.159 --> 1:20:26.427
- You have a good day.
- Thanks, you too.

1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:27.328
Okay.

1:22:23.678 --> 1:22:26.548
You, I saw you at the piano
bar.

1:22:27.715 --> 1:22:30.017
That was magnificent, young man.

1:22:30.050 --> 1:22:31.218
The caliber of your talent is
gonna

1:22:31.251 --> 1:22:33.454
put you on the world stage.

1:22:35.122 --> 1:22:37.090
I look forward to what your
future holds.

1:22:37.124 --> 1:22:40.394
And look at that face, the full
package.

1:22:40.427 --> 1:22:41.295
Fabulous.

1:22:43.430 --> 1:22:44.566
You're ready.

1:22:44.599 --> 1:22:46.133
You're ready.

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:47.167
Confidence.

1:22:48.603 --> 1:22:51.071
Saturday is gone, take a deep
breath.

1:22:52.707 --> 1:22:54.408
Deep breaths.

1:22:54.441 --> 1:22:58.045
Now, once you perform, you
come backstage and wait.

1:22:58.078 --> 1:23:00.013
The results will be announced
immediately

1:23:00.047 --> 1:23:02.015
following the competition.

1:23:02.049 --> 1:23:03.984
So Beatrice, you're up.

1:23:08.255 --> 1:23:10.457
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1:23:10.491 --> 1:23:12.059
You too.

1:23:21.836 --> 1:23:26.373
I'm glad to see you've
come to your senses.

1:23:26.406 --> 1:23:29.544
Potassium for the nerves,
smart boy.

1:23:31.813 --> 1:23:33.781
- Victor.
- Corinna.

1:23:33.815 --> 1:23:34.682
Hmm.

1:23:36.250 --> 1:23:39.621
I just wanted to tell
you good luck tonight.

1:23:39.654 --> 1:23:41.823
You are a stellar pianist.

1:23:41.856 --> 1:23:45.325
And just remember, play from
your heart.

1:23:46.326 --> 1:23:47.194
Hmm?

1:23:48.796 --> 1:23:51.633
- May I help you off?
- Certainly.

1:24:04.177 --> 1:24:06.179
Why do you play, Josh?

1:24:07.414 --> 1:24:08.616
I, because...

1:24:10.217 --> 1:24:11.285
'Cause why?

1:24:12.185 --> 1:24:14.187
Do you love it?

1:24:14.221 --> 1:24:17.224
I've taught you everything I
can.

1:24:17.257 --> 1:24:20.193
Now it's up to you to
do what's in your heart.

1:24:20.227 --> 1:24:22.129
Trust your instincts.

1:24:22.162 --> 1:24:24.264
Don't let any moment get away.

1:26:53.948 --> 1:26:56.751
Now that we got that over
with.

1:27:00.588 --> 1:27:01.989
Once upon a time,

1:27:03.991 --> 1:27:07.829
a young Beethoven got
to play for his idol,

1:27:07.862 --> 1:27:09.564
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

1:27:09.597 --> 1:27:13.634
in the hope that he would
get to study under him.

1:27:15.069 --> 1:27:18.940
Uh, the story goes that
Mozart had no interest

1:27:19.741 --> 1:27:22.677
in being interrupted by
something

1:27:22.710 --> 1:27:25.445
so frivolous and was even colder

1:27:26.514 --> 1:27:30.852
when Beethoven played a
studied piece of Mozart's.

1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:36.624
Beethoven begged for another
chance.

1:27:36.657 --> 1:27:40.427
Mozart played a tune
that the young composer

1:27:40.460 --> 1:27:42.530
could never have possibly heard.

1:27:42.563 --> 1:27:46.500
Beethoven then went on to
improvise on that tune.

1:27:46.534 --> 1:27:49.737
Rumor has it that after
Beethoven played,

1:27:49.771 --> 1:27:52.774
Mozart said, "Look out for that
boy.

1:27:53.808 --> 1:27:56.811
One day he'll give the world
something to talk about."

1:27:56.844 --> 1:27:59.847
Beethoven never went on
to study under Mozart,

1:27:59.881 --> 1:28:04.752
but he became beloved all on
his own, doing his own thing.

1:28:08.723 --> 1:28:10.858
Now, if you'll indulge me,

1:28:14.361 --> 1:28:16.597
I'd like to try my own thing,

1:28:16.631 --> 1:28:18.699
inspired by Beethoven and

1:28:22.737 --> 1:28:24.337
a few new friends.

1:28:28.543 --> 1:28:29.811
For you tonight.

1:30:37.071 --> 1:30:40.473
Sorry, Grandma, my heart's not
in it.

1:30:42.109 --> 1:30:45.179
But everything will be fine,
promise.

1:30:46.881 --> 1:30:47.815
Love you.

You sound amazing.

1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:42.256
I didn't wanna interrupt you.

1:33:42.289 --> 1:33:44.091
Just came to see you.

1:33:45.926 --> 1:33:47.061
Say I'm sorry.

1:33:48.729 --> 1:33:50.331
Okay, well you did.

1:33:51.265 --> 1:33:52.266
That's done.

1:33:57.238 --> 1:33:58.105
Josh.

1:34:00.875 --> 1:34:02.143
- Josh.
- You quit.

1:34:03.911 --> 1:34:06.247
And you are still here,
you should be in London.

1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:07.715
We handed them out to everyone
in town.

1:34:07.748 --> 1:34:09.049
This place is gonna be packed!

1:34:09.083 --> 1:34:11.318
You're gonna make so much money.

1:34:11.352 --> 1:34:13.053
Charlotte, hey.

1:34:13.087 --> 1:34:13.954
Hey.

1:34:15.089 --> 1:34:18.759
We're gonna go home and
get our stuff and shower.

1:34:18.792 --> 1:34:20.761
Back to rehearse, you
know, in like an hour?

1:34:20.794 --> 1:34:21.630
Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.

1:34:21.695 --> 1:34:24.865
I'll be done with the choir by
then.

1:34:32.373 --> 1:34:34.108
How did you know where to find
me?

1:34:34.141 --> 1:34:38.479
The other kids are great
at music, awful with secrets.

1:34:38.513 --> 1:34:43.250
It's wonderful what you do
for those kids in the church.

1:34:44.919 --> 1:34:46.120
I don't get it.

1:34:47.821 --> 1:34:50.858
You got everything you want,
why are you still here?

1:34:50.891 --> 1:34:54.895
You don't know what I wanted,
you quit.

1:34:54.929 --> 1:34:56.463
I left you a note.

1:35:01.268 --> 1:35:03.070
Well, at least you have
it, that's something.

1:35:03.103 --> 1:35:04.838
I haven't read it.

1:35:08.409 --> 1:35:11.478
I just wanted to tell you that
I...

1:35:15.015 --> 1:35:18.419
Ooh, the great Charlotte lost
for words,

1:35:19.486 --> 1:35:24.258
Hmm, I guess there's a first
time for everything, huh?

1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:30.431
When I was watching you
play, you really loved it.

1:35:32.866 --> 1:35:34.735
But I don't feel that.

1:35:36.503 --> 1:35:39.440
I feel like when I'm
playing with all the kids.

1:35:39.473 --> 1:35:44.278
I feel like when I'm playing
with a gig on the toy piano.

1:35:46.847 --> 1:35:48.782
And I feel it with you.

1:35:51.085 --> 1:35:54.188
The performance, the
competition, you were amazing.

1:35:54.221 --> 1:35:57.791
And my grandma couldn't
stop talking about you.

1:35:57.825 --> 1:36:01.395
She told me that the judges
were arguing for hours.

1:36:01.428 --> 1:36:02.363
Is it true?

1:36:04.965 --> 1:36:07.401
Okay, yes, all right, uh...

1:36:07.434 --> 1:36:09.503
I just wanted to say that I'm

1:36:09.537 --> 1:36:12.473
I'm sorry for messing up your
life,

1:36:13.508 --> 1:36:15.109
for ruining it and

1:36:17.978 --> 1:36:19.179
I'm just sorry.

1:36:28.389 --> 1:36:32.192
I didn't care why you
quit the competition.

1:36:33.561 --> 1:36:35.963
I cared why you quit on me.

1:36:41.001 --> 1:36:44.004
You left after all of that.

1:36:44.038 --> 1:36:47.341
And you say you feel all of
that, but you

1:36:49.143 --> 1:36:50.411
you walked away.

1:36:53.047 --> 1:36:58.052
I know I messed up, but I
can't take it back.

1:36:59.086 --> 1:37:00.220
I was alone.

1:37:02.323 --> 1:37:03.190
Again.

1:37:12.099 --> 1:37:16.270
I didn't stay for you,
because of you or whatever.

1:37:16.303 --> 1:37:17.171
I know.

1:37:19.006 --> 1:37:20.374
I stayed for me.

1:37:21.643 --> 1:37:23.911
This is where I wanna be.

1:37:30.451 --> 1:37:32.920
I would just prefer you here

1:37:36.423 --> 1:37:37.291
with me.
