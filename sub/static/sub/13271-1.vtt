Hey, what's up?

02:54.665 --> 02:56.542
Of course I'm not late.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.785
Okay. I'm not.

02:58.819 --> 03:01.270
You are special,
you're an artist.

03:01.305 --> 03:03.173
Everything you do
is art.

03:03.207 --> 03:05.659
Why, everything you say,
everything you do

03:05.693 --> 03:06.784
is just all art,
it's just brilliant.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.253
You're brilliant.

03:08.287 --> 03:09.262
Right. You're really good.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.817
Oh, I don't wanna
talk about it.

03:14.852 --> 03:17.045
Dude, chill.

03:17.079 --> 03:20.415
Artists don't need college.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.926
I will pay for
those parking tickets.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.586
You're bringing me down.
I gotta go.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.345
Bye, Mom.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.681
Breathe.

03:28.716 --> 03:31.050
Hi. I'm Lola Perez.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.745
Could you let
Mr. Vasquez know I'm here?

03:33.780 --> 03:35.380
Thanks, I'd appreciate it.

03:35.414 --> 03:38.016
Uh, I don't work here.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.775
I'm a finalist for
the photography internship.

03:39.810 --> 03:41.478
Me, too.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.154
Sh, sh, sh!

03:43.188 --> 03:45.015
Quiet, please.
Voices down.

03:45.049 --> 03:46.741
Mr. Vasquez is having
a creative moment.

03:46.775 --> 03:50.270
Yes, brilliant!
Perfect-alus! Bravo!

03:50.304 --> 03:52.388
- Oh, it's so cool.
- Weird.

03:52.423 --> 03:53.940
Okay.
( clears throat )

03:53.974 --> 03:55.592
Now, can I have
your portfolios?

03:55.626 --> 03:58.044
Mr. Vasquez would like
to review them before
your final interviews.

03:58.078 --> 03:58.937
Careful. Mine's
still wet.

04:01.173 --> 04:03.883
- Mine's perfectly dry.
- Thanks.

04:03.918 --> 04:05.209
Please have a seat.

04:05.244 --> 04:06.411
This could take
ten seconds,

04:06.446 --> 04:07.612
or ten hours.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.324
Hey, didn't you go
to Highland Park?

04:19.358 --> 04:20.841
Um, yes.

04:20.877 --> 04:22.619
I still do.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.103
Wait.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.397
You were
that nerdy sophomore

04:26.432 --> 04:27.782
in my senior
geometry class.

04:27.816 --> 04:28.908
I'm not nerdy.
I'm dedicated.

04:28.942 --> 04:31.828
I skipped
the eighth grade,

04:31.862 --> 04:33.772
and now I'm on track
for early college admission.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.081
Wow. That sounds
really fun.

04:35.116 --> 04:37.909
But not.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.037
( chuckles )
Well, I've already
got 12 credits,

04:41.072 --> 04:43.022
two hundred hours
of community service,

04:43.056 --> 04:45.375
maintain a 4.2 GPA,
and run my own business.

04:45.409 --> 04:49.504
This art internship
will perfectly round out
my transcript.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.115
Transcript?
That's why you're here?

04:52.149 --> 04:55.827
Well, you know, that,
and my passion for photography.

04:55.861 --> 04:57.979
Right, right.

04:58.014 --> 05:01.040
Well, do you wanna know
what I did my last year
before college?

05:01.075 --> 05:03.151
You were accepted
into college?

05:03.185 --> 05:05.487
I could have been,
but I opted out.

05:05.521 --> 05:08.590
You see, a real artist
is a student of life.

05:08.624 --> 05:10.784
Anyway, an internship
with Leon Vasquez

05:10.818 --> 05:14.020
would fast-track my career
as a professional photographer.

05:14.054 --> 05:16.840
( ringtone plays
"Fur Elise" )

05:16.874 --> 05:18.258
Professor Anderson,
is this about

05:18.292 --> 05:20.310
my recommendation letter?

05:20.344 --> 05:22.420
<i>No, I'm actually looking for</i>
<i>someone to babysit tonight,</i>

05:22.454 --> 05:24.247
<i>because my niece</i>
<i>bailed on me.</i>

05:24.282 --> 05:25.699
- Okay, uh...
-<i>  Do you believe it?</i>

05:25.733 --> 05:27.384
I'd love to babysit,
but unfortunately,

05:27.418 --> 05:29.210
I'm already booked
with the Coopers tonight.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.253
<i>Let me know if you can</i>
<i>think of anybody.</i>

05:30.288 --> 05:32.530
Sure. Of course.
If I think of anyone.

05:32.564 --> 05:34.341
-<i>  Thanks, Jenny.</i>
- All right. Bye.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.509
You're a babysitter?

05:36.544 --> 05:38.453
What's that, like,
five bucks an hour?

05:38.488 --> 05:40.405
Try 20. Double time
on holidays.

05:40.439 --> 05:43.124
To watch kids
watch TV?

05:43.158 --> 05:45.935
( laughs )
You've obviously
never babysat.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.929
Yeah, 'cause I obviously
have a life.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.548
Oh,<i>  magnifico!</i>
My exceptional finalists.

05:57.473 --> 05:59.315
Oh, gosh!
Way to go, klutz.

05:59.349 --> 06:00.458
A smoothie to
an interview?!

06:00.492 --> 06:02.861
Stupendous
news, ladies.

06:02.895 --> 06:06.881
I've decided interviews
will not be needed today.

06:06.915 --> 06:08.633
Awesome.
Sorry, kid,
maybe next year.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.010
You wish.

06:11.044 --> 06:12.604
Since you both have
vastly different

06:12.638 --> 06:13.747
artistic points
of view,

06:13.781 --> 06:18.910
I feel a more unconventional
approach is warranted.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.670
I want you to dazzle me!

06:20.704 --> 06:23.974
- Dazzle you?
- Could you clarify,
dazzle, sir?

06:24.008 --> 06:25.208
Take some new shots.

06:25.242 --> 06:26.709
Be innovative.

06:26.743 --> 06:30.071
I want to feel
your unique passions
for photography.

06:30.106 --> 06:31.414
Oh, cool!

06:31.448 --> 06:32.006
( speaking fluent Spanish )

06:37.471 --> 06:38.388
( speaking halting
Spanish )

06:42.092 --> 06:44.694
<i>Excelente.</i>

06:44.696 --> 06:46.996
We'll reconvene Monday,
and I'll make my decision.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.466
That gives you
all weekend.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.859
- May the best artist win.
- BOTH: She will.

06:51.894 --> 06:53.302
- Bye-bye.
-<i>  Ciao. Gracias.</i>

06:53.337 --> 06:54.070
<i>Adios.</i>

06:56.065 --> 07:00.402
Well, this hardly seems
fair considering the time
constraints.

07:00.436 --> 07:03.121
Oh, right. Have fun
babysitting.

07:06.934 --> 07:10.211
No! Officer, wait!

07:10.246 --> 07:13.431
Officer, hi.
I'm here.

07:13.465 --> 07:15.250
Sorry, miss.
It's a loading zone.

07:15.284 --> 07:17.777
But I was loading.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.771
I was unloading
a super heavy portfolio

07:19.805 --> 07:21.989
for this very prestigious
art internship.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.342
- I spoke to Mr. Vasquez.
- Uh-huh.

07:24.376 --> 07:25.226
( ringtone playing
"Fur Elise" )

07:26.862 --> 07:28.179
Beethoven?

07:28.213 --> 07:30.465
What?

07:30.499 --> 07:33.001
"Fur Elise" is one
of my favorites.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.277
( nervous chuckle )

07:36.998 --> 07:38.572
- That your boyfriend
calling?
- What? No.

07:38.607 --> 07:40.025
Boyfriend? What boyfriend?

07:40.059 --> 07:41.876
No boyfriend
Totally single.
Sorry.

07:41.911 --> 07:45.013
- Hello, stranger
interrupting my day.
<i>- Hey, Jenny.</i>

07:45.047 --> 07:47.039
It's Zac.

07:47.074 --> 07:48.833
Look, I know it's
short notice,

07:48.868 --> 07:50.218
but I just scored
great tickets

07:50.252 --> 07:53.129
for the Psychic Rockets
concert tonight, and I was--

07:53.164 --> 07:54.422
Awesome. I love that band.

07:56.192 --> 07:57.950
But I hate concerts.

07:57.985 --> 08:00.228
They're so juvenile.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.847
Sorry, Zeke.
Not interested. Bye.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.969
( sighs )

08:08.003 --> 08:11.347
Whew! Stalkers.
What's a girl to do?

08:11.381 --> 08:13.082
Wait, you're
still writing?

08:13.117 --> 08:14.968
Uh, officer, I can't
get another ticket.

08:15.002 --> 08:16.027
My parents said if I got
another parking ticket,

08:16.061 --> 08:17.954
- I would lose
my car keys.
- Sorry. I'm a rookie.

08:17.988 --> 08:20.381
Can't break the rules.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.499
I'm sure a smart girl
like you can find a way

08:21.533 --> 08:22.492
to pay her own tickets.

08:24.227 --> 08:25.644
Have a nice day.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.288
Thanks.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.961
Eighty bucks?!

08:33.996 --> 08:36.722
Where am I gonna get
80 bucks?

08:36.756 --> 08:38.424
( "Fur Elise" plays )

08:41.369 --> 08:43.129
Hello.

08:43.163 --> 08:44.722
Jenny, hi, it's me again.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.432
I'm desperate for
a babysitter.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.701
My awards gala
is in two hours,

08:48.736 --> 08:50.103
and I am
the guest of honor.

08:50.137 --> 08:51.980
Are you sure you don't
know anybody who can babysit?

08:52.014 --> 08:53.515
I'll pay double.

08:53.549 --> 08:54.958
( cash register jingles )

08:54.992 --> 08:57.902
Of course.

08:57.936 --> 09:00.054
My good friend Lola
is very responsible.

09:00.088 --> 09:01.722
- I'll send her over.
<i>- Great.</i>

09:01.757 --> 09:03.491
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

09:12.134 --> 09:14.143
Hey, Zac.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.521
Dirty tires,
as requested.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.464
Sorry. We're closed.

09:20.276 --> 09:21.342
Come on, let's go.

09:33.396 --> 09:35.698
TREY: Yes, of course.

09:35.732 --> 09:37.292
My mom's going to
some party tonight.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.786
Dude, I said I'm in.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.962
Pick me up in 30 and don't
honk the horn this time.

09:41.997 --> 09:44.124
- Trey Anderson.
- Mom! A little privacy.

09:44.158 --> 09:47.476
Kids who spend over $200
on apps without permission

09:47.511 --> 09:49.703
don't get privacy,

09:49.738 --> 09:51.856
or phones,
or tablets.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.408
You forgot to cut off
my air supply.

09:53.442 --> 09:55.301
Oh, that can be arranged.

09:55.335 --> 09:57.019
Look, we're leaving
for the gala soon,

09:57.054 --> 09:58.304
so please, be nice
to the babysitter.

09:58.338 --> 09:59.922
Wait, Jenny's coming?

09:59.957 --> 10:02.550
No. Ugh. One of
Jenny's friends.

10:02.585 --> 10:03.901
And you need
to shape up, Trey.

10:03.935 --> 10:06.495
At this rate, you'll never be
responsible enough to babysit.

10:06.530 --> 10:09.065
Promise?

10:09.067 --> 10:12.327
Bobby Anderson, what
have you done to my kitchen?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.686
It's called baking.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.438
Mom!

10:16.473 --> 10:17.940
Dad promised
to take me.

10:17.975 --> 10:19.801
The Sirens
are playing the Belles.

10:19.835 --> 10:22.361
I'm sorry, honey.
I got the dates mixed up.

10:22.395 --> 10:24.931
It's not every day
your mother's research

10:24.965 --> 10:28.050
is honored by
the National Science Foundation.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.502
Dad will take you
to the next derby.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.421
We promise.

10:31.455 --> 10:33.264
- Can you get our coats?
- Yes.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.017
Mom, you promised
to taste my frosting.

10:36.051 --> 10:39.019
- In a minute.
- I guess everyone in
this family breaks promises.

10:39.054 --> 10:40.221
Come on,
Roller Derby's lame.

10:40.256 --> 10:41.614
You're lame!

10:41.649 --> 10:43.624
Guys, don't start.

10:43.659 --> 10:45.042
KATY: Hurry. Jenny will
be here any minute.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.437
Ta-da!

10:47.471 --> 10:49.013
Okay, bumblebee,
I can't decide

10:49.047 --> 10:52.800
if I would rather lose feeling
in my toes or my heels.

10:52.835 --> 10:56.254
I told you to go
with the strappy sandals.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.265
Excuse me, young lady.
What are you wearing?

10:59.299 --> 11:02.685
- Lipstick.
- No. Do not be cute.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.661
Those earrings
are very expensive, sweetie.

11:03.695 --> 11:05.880
They're one of a kind.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.633
But Mommy, everyone knows
diamonds are a must

11:08.667 --> 11:09.842
with evening casual.

11:09.876 --> 11:12.028
Off. Now.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.063
If my sister
can shave her head,

11:14.097 --> 11:15.489
I should be able
to wear diamonds.

11:15.523 --> 11:16.799
What?!

11:16.834 --> 11:18.501
( buzzing )

11:20.846 --> 11:23.681
( gasps )
Emily Cooper,
what are you doing?

11:23.715 --> 11:27.085
- You little tattletale!
- You don't have the right
head shape for a buzz cut.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.870
Why don't I give you
a buzz cut?

11:28.904 --> 11:30.497
- Okay, stop.
- ( huffs angrily )

11:30.531 --> 11:34.234
Sweetheart, your hair
is beautiful just
the way it is.

11:34.268 --> 11:36.919
I don't want you pulling
any of your pranks tonight,

11:36.953 --> 11:37.979
and please be good
for Jenny.

11:38.013 --> 11:39.480
( angry huff )

11:39.515 --> 11:41.423
I'm too old
for a babysitter.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.543
Me, too.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.610
Katy Cooper, freeze.

11:48.515 --> 11:50.575
I thought diamonds
were forever.

11:55.964 --> 11:57.749
( rock music
ringtone plays )

12:03.279 --> 12:04.380
Oh, no.

12:06.341 --> 12:07.800
This is not happening.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.487
- Hello.
- BOY: <i>  Lola, what's up?</i>

12:11.521 --> 12:13.231
No, this isn't Lola.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.057
I just...
I have her phone.

12:15.092 --> 12:17.026
<i>Come to</i>
<i>a toga party tonight?</i>

12:17.060 --> 12:18.560
No, I don't wanna come to
a toga party.

12:18.595 --> 12:21.188
GUYS: <i>  Toga, toga, toga!</i>

12:21.223 --> 12:21.939
- ( horn honks )
- Ugh!

12:33.919 --> 12:34.911
( doorbell ringing )

12:37.330 --> 12:38.873
Hey, dude,
what's your name?

12:38.907 --> 12:39.916
You're so cute.

12:44.313 --> 12:45.338
Alison, was that...

12:47.950 --> 12:50.034
Lola? Helen Anderson.
So nice to meet you.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.978
Please come on in.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.488
I see that you've
met Alison.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.758
- So sweet.
- Yes.

12:56.792 --> 12:57.917
So my niece
was supposed to sit,

12:57.951 --> 13:00.637
but she flaked because of some
silly concert in the city.

13:00.671 --> 13:02.780
So how long have you known
our Jenny?

13:02.814 --> 13:06.551
Oh, um, since forever.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.544
We share a love of
geometry and...

13:08.578 --> 13:10.421
children.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.331
- Oh, how unique.
- Yeah.

13:11.365 --> 13:15.326
Lola, this is Bobby.
He has to finish 100 cupcakes

13:15.360 --> 13:17.302
for his junior chef
competition tomorrow.

13:17.337 --> 13:19.614
- Taste my frosting.
- Sure.

13:19.648 --> 13:21.890
Oh, dig that color, dude.

13:21.925 --> 13:23.500
It's the melted
gummy worms.

13:23.535 --> 13:25.662
Oh, Bobby,
you didn't.

13:25.696 --> 13:27.530
Mom, all the great chefs
improvise.

13:27.564 --> 13:29.131
I'm never gonna win
with ordinary cupcakes.

13:29.165 --> 13:31.617
It's not bad,
but you could
kick it up a notch.

13:31.651 --> 13:33.619
I know. It needs
something.

13:33.653 --> 13:35.688
I just have to find
the perfect ingredient.

13:35.722 --> 13:38.240
Now Trey is upstairs
grounded.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.677
Alison is sulking
because of the Roller Derby,

13:40.711 --> 13:44.522
and this little
precious baby girl

13:44.556 --> 13:46.691
is Lady Marmalade,
aren't you, my precious?

13:46.725 --> 13:48.876
Yes, you are.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.185
Now she has
a very big day tomorrow

13:50.220 --> 13:53.797
at the Kennel Club,
so she needs
complete relaxation,

13:53.832 --> 13:55.724
and no stress.
No stress for my baby.

13:55.759 --> 13:57.960
Now very important.

13:57.995 --> 14:01.122
The stove and the hot tub
are strictly off limits
when we're gone.

14:01.156 --> 14:03.758
Make sure that Bobby
returns the kitchen

14:03.792 --> 14:05.384
to its pre-cupcake
tidiness.

14:05.418 --> 14:08.496
Tidiness? I'm creating.

14:08.530 --> 14:09.496
And you would be
my personal hero

14:09.531 --> 14:11.941
if you could just
toss in a couple
of loads of laundry.

14:11.975 --> 14:13.868
- Laundry.
- Yes.

14:13.902 --> 14:17.596
Okay, here's the invite
and my number.

14:17.630 --> 14:19.999
- Oh, hi.
I'm Hal Anderson.
- Lola.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.450
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

14:21.484 --> 14:24.186
Oh, no, we are not taking my
brand-new freshly detailed SUV

14:24.220 --> 14:27.606
into the dirty, grimy city.
We're taking the sedan.

14:27.641 --> 14:29.617
- You're the boss.
- Thank you.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.944
Okay, Lola,
here is my cell,

14:31.978 --> 14:34.238
and the place
we're going to be tonight.

14:34.272 --> 14:35.906
Now are you sure you can
handle three kids?

14:35.941 --> 14:38.167
Oh, my gosh,
what am I saying?

14:38.169 --> 14:39.885
Of course you can.
You were recommended by Jenny.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.703
- She taught me
everything I know.
- Great.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.991
Hi, Jen.
Come on in.

14:45.025 --> 14:48.603
Oh, Mr. Cooper,
that's a nice tux.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.371
Okay, honey.
Honey.

14:50.405 --> 14:52.765
She did it again.

14:52.799 --> 14:54.316
Katy, sweetheart,
what did I tell you

14:54.351 --> 14:55.984
about glittering
your father?

14:56.019 --> 14:57.511
He needed
a little bling.

14:57.546 --> 14:59.855
Okay,
don't you worry.

14:59.889 --> 15:01.524
We will clean that
right up.

15:01.558 --> 15:02.416
You guys just go
and have a great time.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.351
Thank you, Jenny.

15:04.385 --> 15:06.604
Now would you please
say hello to Jenny?

15:06.639 --> 15:09.432
Honestly.
Look it, I left money

15:09.466 --> 15:11.701
so you guys can
go for ice cream.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.503
Emily is banned from
doing anything to her hair.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.347
Katy is banned from
my jewelry box.

15:16.381 --> 15:18.483
- Great.
- Am I forgetting anything?

15:18.517 --> 15:20.376
My three-star party
survival kit.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.270
Mints, safety pins
and emergency cash.

15:22.304 --> 15:25.840
- Take care of our babies.
- I'll guard them with my life.

15:25.874 --> 15:26.982
- We're going out.
- I know.

15:27.017 --> 15:28.125
Run! Just kidding.

15:35.000 --> 15:35.800
Ooh, hot tub.

15:47.621 --> 15:49.221
Hot tub out back?

15:49.255 --> 15:51.456
- Yep.
- Cool.

15:51.491 --> 15:53.434
Jailer Swift
on the attack!

15:53.468 --> 15:54.860
Whoa!

15:56.596 --> 15:58.197
Out of my kitchen!

16:06.348 --> 16:08.516
Fire! Lola, help!

16:08.550 --> 16:11.276
Fire, fire.
Help!

16:11.311 --> 16:13.654
Hurry. Fire! Fire!

16:13.689 --> 16:17.408
- What?
- Fire!

16:17.442 --> 16:20.177
- Put out the fire!
- Uh, fire extinguisher?

16:20.212 --> 16:21.654
( "Fur Elise"
ringtone plays )

16:21.688 --> 16:24.565
- BOBBY: This is bad!
- LOLA: Get the fire
extinguisher.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.501
Hello. Lola?

16:26.535 --> 16:31.013
- No, A.J.
-<i>  A.J. Anderson?</i>
<i>It's Jenny Parker.</i>

16:31.047 --> 16:32.339
Why are you
answering my phone?

16:32.373 --> 16:33.799
It's the babysitter's phone.

16:33.833 --> 16:36.427
- Babysitter?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

16:36.461 --> 16:38.162
Your friend. I think
her name's Lola.

16:38.197 --> 16:42.783
A.J. sweetie, could you please
put the babysitter on the phone?

16:42.818 --> 16:45.211
- She's busy.
<i>- Doing what?</i>

16:45.245 --> 16:46.287
Putting out the fire.

16:47.797 --> 16:50.107
The fire?!

16:50.141 --> 16:52.476
A.J., don't panic.
I'll be right there, okay?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.211
Kids, we're going
to the Andersons.

16:56.123 --> 16:57.465
Trey Anderson?

16:57.499 --> 16:59.491
Katy, let's go.

16:59.526 --> 17:01.827
Katy, I mean now.

17:01.861 --> 17:02.595
- ( alarm blaring )
- BOBBY: Come on, hurry!

17:10.645 --> 17:11.752
( alarm continues
blaring )

17:11.788 --> 17:13.321
That was awesome.

17:13.357 --> 17:16.392
Wait here, don't move.
I gotta get my camera
out of the car.

17:16.425 --> 17:19.362
Camera?

17:19.396 --> 17:22.815
( horn honks )

17:22.848 --> 17:24.659
Hey, let me in,
you little punks.

17:24.693 --> 17:26.402
Unlock the door!

17:26.435 --> 17:28.595
Unlock the door!

17:28.630 --> 17:32.366
What in the world
is going on here?!

17:32.400 --> 17:33.701
Uh...

17:33.735 --> 17:35.711
What is on fire?

17:35.746 --> 17:38.030
- Hey, girl, what's up?
- Girl?

17:38.064 --> 17:39.298
( stammering )
What are you doing?

17:39.333 --> 17:41.092
Babysitting.
Obviously.

17:45.096 --> 17:47.631
I can't believe this.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.926
This is going to take
forever to clean up.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.410
( Lola laughing )
Yeah, it will.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.453
You kids better
get crackin'.

17:53.488 --> 17:54.438
- Us?
- ( shutter clicks )

17:57.209 --> 17:58.501
Hey, where's Trey?

17:58.535 --> 18:00.111
Who's Trey?

18:01.996 --> 18:03.239
( knocking )

18:11.731 --> 18:15.450
He's searching for
tickets online.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.371
Psychic Rockets tickets
at Tiny's Pawn Shop?

18:18.405 --> 18:19.922
He's going to
a concert?

18:19.956 --> 18:21.565
That's awesome.

18:21.599 --> 18:24.051
How could you let
a 14-year-old kid
sneak out into the city?

18:24.086 --> 18:25.402
I'm sorry, how is this
my fault?

18:25.437 --> 18:27.613
Babysitting rule
number one:

18:27.648 --> 18:29.715
Never take your eyes
off the kids. Ever.

18:29.749 --> 18:31.567
Okay, this is bad.

18:31.601 --> 18:32.934
My name,
my reputation,

18:32.969 --> 18:34.612
my entire
college future

18:34.646 --> 18:35.788
is just down the drain.

18:35.822 --> 18:37.648
Think, Jenny, think.

18:41.395 --> 18:43.378
He has to get
the tickets, right?

18:43.413 --> 18:45.039
I'll drive into the city
and bring him back myself.

18:45.073 --> 18:46.181
I know the city.
I can get him.

18:46.215 --> 18:48.275
You're the one
who lost him.

18:48.310 --> 18:49.885
Relax, girlfriend, I'm
just trying to help.

18:49.919 --> 18:52.697
I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm not your friend.
I don't even know you.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.039
You don't?
My mom thinks you do.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.110
Uh, I mean,
I was joking.

18:58.144 --> 18:59.787
'Cause, like,
I do know her.

18:59.821 --> 19:01.772
We're just not...
besties.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.933
Why don't we all
go get Trey?

19:03.967 --> 19:05.617
No. Your parents
would kill me.

19:05.652 --> 19:08.954
They'll kill you when
they find out a total
stranger is watching us.

19:08.988 --> 19:10.681
And who's gonna
tell them?

19:14.210 --> 19:16.896
Anybody have to
go to the bathroom?

19:25.689 --> 19:28.249
No, we can't.

19:28.283 --> 19:30.125
Are you gonna fit
all of us in your car?

19:30.160 --> 19:31.935
Okay, but...

19:31.970 --> 19:33.896
BOTH: I'll drive.

19:33.930 --> 19:35.080
- I'll drive!
- Thanks.

19:42.004 --> 19:44.798
( bicycle bell rings )

19:44.833 --> 19:48.068
Okay, we just got passed,

19:48.103 --> 19:49.244
- ( horns honking )
- by a bicycle.

19:49.278 --> 19:50.871
I am not adding
a speeding ticket

19:50.905 --> 19:52.297
and a stolen car
to this disaster.

19:52.331 --> 19:55.234
- ( horns blaring )
- BOBBY: Can we stop at
the grocery store?

19:55.268 --> 19:57.119
No, I told you.
We're going to get Trey,

19:57.154 --> 19:59.155
and then we're heading
straight home.

19:59.189 --> 20:00.898
If anyone asks,
where did we go, people?

20:00.932 --> 20:03.150
ALL: Ice cream.

20:05.386 --> 20:08.555
You know, a professional
manicure could do
your hands wonders.

20:08.589 --> 20:10.516
- How old are you?
- Seven.

20:10.550 --> 20:13.878
You know what I was doing
with my hands when I was seven?

20:13.912 --> 20:15.354
No, and she doesn't
want to.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.538
At least pretend
to set an example.

20:16.572 --> 20:19.700
- Smile, Jenny.
- This is no time
for pictures.

20:19.735 --> 20:22.794
It is always
the time for pictures.
Art is spontaneous.

20:22.829 --> 20:24.296
- So say cheese!
- No!

20:27.718 --> 20:29.301
( barking )

20:31.863 --> 20:34.181
( loud rumbling )

20:45.184 --> 20:47.811
JENNY: Okay, guys,
we find this pawn shop,

20:47.846 --> 20:49.488
get Trey, and get home
as fast as possible.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.337
GPS VOICE: <i>  Turn left,</i>
<i>600 feet.</i>

21:13.004 --> 21:15.014
<i>Turn left.</i>

21:26.451 --> 21:28.552
Are you sure
this is right?

21:28.586 --> 21:30.621
Well, yeah, that's what
the GPS says.

21:30.655 --> 21:32.072
<i>Turn left</i>
<i>in 200 feet.</i>

21:36.077 --> 21:37.286
- Hey, puddle!
- ( screaming )

21:39.347 --> 21:42.107
That was close.
If anything happens

21:42.141 --> 21:43.683
to this car,
we're dead.

21:43.718 --> 21:46.628
<i>Approaching destination</i>
<i>on left.</i>

21:46.663 --> 21:47.855
There it is,
there it is.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.014
Park here, park here.

21:49.048 --> 21:50.341
- Park here.
- Okay!

21:55.404 --> 21:58.040
Okay, you guys wait here.
I'll go.

21:58.074 --> 22:00.876
- Um, Jenny.
- Oh, Katy.

22:00.910 --> 22:02.995
Why didn't you go
before we left?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.964
I didn't have to go
before we left, obviously.

22:05.998 --> 22:08.350
It's okay.
I'll take her.

22:08.384 --> 22:09.952
No. Babysitting rule
number two:

22:09.986 --> 22:11.845
Leave no child behind.

22:11.879 --> 22:12.821
Come on, kids,
let's go.

22:15.925 --> 22:17.451
- LOLA: Cool car.
- JENNY: Yes, it's lovely.

22:19.679 --> 22:21.763
Yeah, yeah,
we're all set.

22:21.797 --> 22:25.300
Midnight. We bring the varmint,
you bring the 100 grand cash.

22:25.334 --> 22:28.120
Yeah, yeah, 100 grand.

22:28.154 --> 22:29.546
Look, this is
a sapphire ferret.

22:29.580 --> 22:32.124
There's only three of them
in the whole entire world.

22:32.158 --> 22:33.550
You want me to make it
200 grand?

22:36.904 --> 22:40.515
All right then.
Midnight.

22:40.550 --> 22:42.827
No funny business.
I gotta go.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.078
What do you kids want?

22:45.113 --> 22:47.931
This place is so cool.
It's so rustic.

22:47.965 --> 22:49.366
Hey, no pictures.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.176
Watch the camera, man.

22:51.210 --> 22:52.844
Hi. We are looking for Tiny.

22:52.878 --> 22:56.323
I'm Tiny.
Who wants to know?

22:56.357 --> 22:58.300
My name is Jenny Parker.
I'm a babysitter,

22:58.335 --> 23:00.503
and we are looking for
a teenage boy.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.329
He came here earlier to buy
some concert tickets.

23:02.364 --> 23:04.832
Oh, yeah.
You want the Scalper.

23:04.866 --> 23:06.583
Make it quick.

23:09.128 --> 23:11.104
Uh, you know what?
That's okay.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.824
He looks busy.
We can wait.

23:13.858 --> 23:15.885
No, we can't.
Let's go.

23:15.919 --> 23:17.928
Thanks, dude.

23:25.787 --> 23:27.187
Let go.

23:37.899 --> 23:39.491
Stay ahead.
Stay ahead of me.

23:47.199 --> 23:48.667
- ( clears throat )
- ( clears throat )

23:57.009 --> 23:58.093
( animal chittering )

24:07.587 --> 24:10.797
Hi there, Mr. Scalper sir.

24:10.832 --> 24:12.791
Sorry to interrupt

24:12.826 --> 24:14.452
your little martial arts
routine there,

24:14.486 --> 24:17.312
but did you happen to sell
Psychic Rockets tickets

24:17.346 --> 24:18.872
to a kid
earlier today?

24:18.907 --> 24:20.574
Maybe I did.

24:21.901 --> 24:23.810
Maybe I didn't.

24:23.844 --> 24:26.580
Well, maybe if
we called the cops,

24:26.614 --> 24:28.340
and told them there's
a weird scary dude

24:28.374 --> 24:30.942
with a sword selling tickets
to minors,

24:30.976 --> 24:32.419
would you remember him then?

24:34.681 --> 24:35.889
Kid paid with ones.

24:35.924 --> 24:38.467
I hate ones.

24:41.129 --> 24:43.472
Hey, little guy.
Hungry?

24:54.358 --> 24:56.618
Kid said something
about pizza.

24:56.653 --> 24:58.970
I hate pizza.

24:59.005 --> 25:00.781
Pizza? That's great.

25:00.815 --> 25:04.209
That narrows it down
to about, I don't know,
4,000 restaurants.

25:04.243 --> 25:07.637
Mario's. It's his favorite
pizza place.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.566
I mean, if I was
gonna guess.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.669
Guessing? Is that what
they call stalking
these days?

25:17.656 --> 25:19.958
Jenny!

25:19.992 --> 25:22.293
Bobby, what are you doing?

25:22.328 --> 25:25.239
Bobby, calm down.
What is that, a weasel?

25:25.273 --> 25:26.614
BOBBY: I don't know.

25:26.649 --> 25:29.143
JENNY: Kids,
don't touch it.

25:29.177 --> 25:30.618
Kids, stay back.

25:30.653 --> 25:32.212
LOLA: Hey, man.
Hey, watch it.

25:32.247 --> 25:33.739
What are you doing?!

25:33.773 --> 25:34.731
Hey, the ferret's loose.

25:46.986 --> 25:48.128
I got him. Okay.

25:48.163 --> 25:50.464
Oh, I got him.

25:50.498 --> 25:52.374
That's so cool.
Smile.

25:52.409 --> 25:54.151
Hey, I said
no more pictures.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.594
JENNY: Lola,
no means no.

25:55.628 --> 25:58.539
TINY: Get the ferret.
Don't let the ferret get away.

25:58.573 --> 26:01.867
The car's being towed.
Let's go!

26:01.901 --> 26:04.052
- Where'd it go?
- ( kids screaming )

26:06.322 --> 26:08.115
JENNY: Hey, wait!

26:08.149 --> 26:10.959
No, no, no.
Stop!

26:10.994 --> 26:12.227
No, really, stop.

26:12.262 --> 26:15.506
Okay, go.
Hi, sorry.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.540
We did not see the sign.
This isn't even my car.

26:17.575 --> 26:19.410
If you could just
please unhook it,

26:19.444 --> 26:21.270
- we're here now.
- Sure, for 100 bucks.

26:21.304 --> 26:23.129
100 bucks?
That's highway robbery.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.348
- We should have you towed.
- ( revs engine )

26:25.382 --> 26:27.275
No, that's fine.
100 bucks.

26:27.310 --> 26:28.819
- Debit card is like
cash, right?
- Yeah.

26:28.853 --> 26:31.721
Oh, no. My purse.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.565
I left it at
the Andersons.

26:33.599 --> 26:35.676
If you could just please
give us the car now,

26:35.678 --> 26:36.802
I promise you I will
give you the money tomorrow.

26:36.836 --> 26:38.445
I don't do layaway, kid.

26:38.479 --> 26:41.348
Okay, does anyone
have any money?

26:41.382 --> 26:43.150
Why do you think
I'm babysitting?

26:43.184 --> 26:45.343
I close at midnight.

26:45.377 --> 26:47.387
But you can't just
leave us stranded here.

26:47.422 --> 26:49.531
I mean, we're just kids.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.266
- Time to grow up.
- LOLA: Seriously?

26:51.301 --> 26:53.209
No, wait.
Don't go!

26:53.244 --> 26:54.519
( kids screaming )

26:58.165 --> 27:00.342
Hey, you better
wash that.

27:00.376 --> 27:03.237
BOBBY: That's my mom's car!

27:03.271 --> 27:05.172
Well, what now?

27:05.206 --> 27:06.740
( sighs )

27:09.143 --> 27:11.886
Great.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.439
Anybody got
any bright ideas?

27:14.473 --> 27:16.833
It's fine.
It's totally
under control.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.660
We've just got no car,
no money,

27:18.695 --> 27:21.288
no Trey, and we need
100 bucks by midnight.

27:21.322 --> 27:23.657
It's doable.
It's totally doable.

27:23.691 --> 27:25.234
Wait, what about
the ice cream money?

27:25.268 --> 27:26.376
Yes, great thinking.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.962
Um...

27:28.996 --> 27:30.297
Ten bucks.
What's that gonna do?

27:30.331 --> 27:33.241
I saw a bus stop
a few blocks over.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.526
We take the bus
to Mario's,

27:34.560 --> 27:37.245
get Trey,
and by then,

27:37.280 --> 27:38.071
I'll figure out
what I'm gonna do next.

27:38.105 --> 27:40.207
Okay. Whatever you say.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.975
Let's go.

27:42.009 --> 27:43.118
- Jenny.
- Yeah.

27:43.153 --> 27:45.261
I'm scared.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.064
Sweetie, there's...

27:47.098 --> 27:48.139
nothing to be
scared of.

27:48.174 --> 27:50.584
( sirens wailing )

27:50.618 --> 27:52.510
How can you snack
right now?

27:52.545 --> 27:54.504
I'm not snacking.
I'm taste testing.

27:54.538 --> 27:56.140
Where did you get
the candy?

27:56.174 --> 27:57.958
Uh, in the pawn shop.

27:57.992 --> 28:01.086
- Bobby, you took candy
from a stranger?
- They were in a bowl.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.848
- I thought
they were free.
- ( frustrated sigh )

28:04.882 --> 28:07.066
- Hey!
- I guess they
weren't free.

28:07.101 --> 28:08.644
You kids are in
big trouble.

28:08.678 --> 28:10.429
- What do we do?
What do we do?
- Run!

28:10.463 --> 28:12.556
( horn honking )

28:15.551 --> 28:17.770
Are they still chasing us?

28:17.804 --> 28:21.522
( screaming )

28:21.557 --> 28:24.459
We can't lose those kids.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.020
They got a picture of me
with the sapphire ferret,

28:27.054 --> 28:29.581
which would prove
that we stole it.

28:29.615 --> 28:32.401
I'm not goin'
back to jail.

28:32.435 --> 28:34.619
We can get 'em
at that pizza place.

28:43.288 --> 28:45.496
JENNY: Hurry, guys.
Let's run.

28:45.531 --> 28:46.782
KATY: These shoes
aren't made for running.

28:46.816 --> 28:48.842
JENNY: Children,
everyone, on the bus.
Go, go, go, go.

28:52.112 --> 28:54.381
Good evening,
kind sir.

28:54.415 --> 28:56.883
Six kids.
That's 12 bucks.

28:56.918 --> 29:00.061
Is it 12 now?
My, my, how times have changed.

29:00.095 --> 29:01.954
Uh, let's just call it
close enough. Yeah?

29:01.989 --> 29:04.440
- Let's not.
- Okay, well,

29:04.475 --> 29:06.851
the thing is, uh... Karl,

29:06.886 --> 29:09.320
we're having, like,
a minor situation tonight.

29:09.355 --> 29:12.474
You see, thanks to Jenny,

29:12.508 --> 29:14.543
the world's greatest
babysitter here,

29:14.577 --> 29:16.870
we don't have
any additional actual money.

29:16.904 --> 29:18.780
- So...
- Don't listen
to her, Karl.

29:18.814 --> 29:20.089
This whole fiasco
is her fault.

29:20.124 --> 29:23.610
I think we can all
stop pointing fingers
and worry about Trey.

29:23.644 --> 29:24.853
Don't pretend to care
about Trey.

29:24.887 --> 29:27.589
Honestly, Karl, she
doesn't care about
anybody but herself.

29:27.624 --> 29:29.615
I care about
a lot of things, Karl,

29:29.650 --> 29:32.101
- like art and expression
and photography.
- PASSENGER: Let's go.

29:32.136 --> 29:35.672
I bet she didn't even
know who Leon Vasquez
was until today.

29:35.706 --> 29:37.124
I did too.
I read all about him.

29:37.158 --> 29:39.233
Please, I saw your portfolio.
It's as stiff as you are.

29:39.268 --> 29:42.187
Where'd you learn to
take pictures, sweetheart,
your computer?

29:42.221 --> 29:44.789
Where'd you learn
all this snappy sarcasm?
We know it wasn't college.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.075
Enough! Get on
and zip it!

29:47.109 --> 29:48.202
If you could just
send me the address,

29:48.236 --> 29:50.153
- I'd be happy to
send you the balance.
- Sit!

30:06.395 --> 30:08.472
Hey, guys.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.348
A.J.? What are
you doing here?

30:10.382 --> 30:12.543
Trey Anderson, freeze.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.961
- Who's that?
- His babysitter.

30:14.996 --> 30:16.571
You have a babysitter?
I want a babysitter.

30:16.605 --> 30:17.889
She's hot.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.235
You are so lucky
we found you.

30:22.269 --> 30:23.770
Hey, Jenny.
You look great.

30:25.039 --> 30:27.165
Hi, Trey.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.716
Please don't
rat me out, Jenny.

30:28.750 --> 30:30.227
I'll be grounded
for life.

30:30.261 --> 30:31.611
Probably till
you're 18.

30:31.646 --> 30:33.522
- Who are you?
- Lola.

30:33.556 --> 30:35.815
Technically,
I'm your babysitter,

30:35.850 --> 30:36.992
so thanks for making me
look bad, by the way.

30:37.026 --> 30:40.770
You didn't need help for that.
Come on, Trey, let's go.

30:40.805 --> 30:43.881
- What about the concert?
- There's no way you're
going to that concert.

30:43.916 --> 30:46.893
Besides, we have
much bigger problems
to deal with right now.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.445
Jenny got Mom's
new car towed.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.974
- You drove my mom's
car into the city?
- To get you,

30:51.976 --> 30:54.000
and now we need $100
to get it back by midnight.

30:54.034 --> 30:57.079
- I don't suppose you
losers have any money.
- I spent it all on tickets.

30:57.113 --> 31:00.448
That's it. Why don't we just
scalp Trey's concert ticket

31:00.483 --> 31:02.692
to get the cash
for the car?

31:02.726 --> 31:04.411
You mean,
sell it ourselves?

31:04.445 --> 31:07.230
Exactly. Brilliant.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.374
- Wait. It's mine.
- Oh, cool.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.159
So you wouldn't mind
explaining to your mother

31:11.161 --> 31:12.177
that her car got towed
and her precious children

31:12.211 --> 31:16.206
spent the night
sitting on a cold
park bench in the city.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.149
I have a better idea.

31:18.184 --> 31:22.328
Why don't we just
call her now, shall we?

31:22.363 --> 31:25.373
Oh, Helen.
( sighs )

31:32.390 --> 31:33.723
This is so not fair.

31:33.757 --> 31:35.383
Life isn't fair, kid.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.130
Jenny, I really have to
go to the bathroom.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.157
Okay.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.951
Everyone, stay put.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.953
Hey, Bobby,
check this out.

31:46.987 --> 31:49.021
Oh, that's so cool.

31:49.056 --> 31:51.199
Bummer about the concert.

31:51.233 --> 31:54.411
Dude, forget the concert.
Go for Jenny.

31:54.445 --> 31:56.505
She was totally
checking you out, too.

31:56.539 --> 31:57.113
- She was?
- Yeah.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.520
I'm going to
the tattoo place.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.038
Cool. Have fun.
Go express yourself.

32:12.071 --> 32:15.432
- Thanks for the zip.
- Not even a problem.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.509
Lucky you had
a safety pin.

32:17.543 --> 32:19.527
I know. Right?

32:19.562 --> 32:21.521
So did you hear
who Zac Chase

32:21.555 --> 32:23.031
is taking to
the concert tonight?

32:23.065 --> 32:24.424
- No. Who?
- Guess.

32:24.458 --> 32:26.450
- Who?
- Guess.

32:26.485 --> 32:27.394
- Who?
- Dominique Cassidy.

32:27.428 --> 32:29.854
No!

32:34.394 --> 32:36.494
Jenny Parker.
Is that really you?

32:36.529 --> 32:39.072
Hey, girls.

32:39.106 --> 32:41.366
Whoa! I never would've
thought to see you

32:41.401 --> 32:43.468
in the city
on a Friday night.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.262
Really? Why not?
It's the weekend, right?

32:46.297 --> 32:47.939
- I live for fun.
- Right.

32:47.973 --> 32:49.482
So who are you
here with?

32:49.517 --> 32:51.551
Just some friends.

32:51.585 --> 32:52.886
They're city friends.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.830
They're really
mature friends.

32:54.864 --> 32:56.172
You probably
wouldn't know them.

32:59.676 --> 33:02.437
Help. I'm all twisted.

33:02.471 --> 33:04.531
Oh, poor little girl.

33:04.565 --> 33:05.915
Where's your mommy?

33:05.949 --> 33:08.568
I'll go help you
find her.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.145
- I have to wash my hands.
- You can use sanitizer.

33:16.652 --> 33:18.436
Where'd everybody go?

33:18.470 --> 33:20.480
Bobby?

33:20.514 --> 33:21.815
A.J.?

33:21.849 --> 33:23.925
- Smile.
- Lola.

33:23.959 --> 33:27.212
- Where are the kids?
- Uh, specifically,
I don't know. Around.

33:27.246 --> 33:31.023
- Around? Are you
out of your mind?
- Possibly.

33:31.058 --> 33:34.110
Babysitting rule
number one: Never take
your eyes off the kids.

33:34.145 --> 33:36.904
Trey, A.J., Bobby.

33:36.939 --> 33:39.065
Uh, where's Emily?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.708
Uh, she's getting
a tattoo.

33:40.742 --> 33:41.943
Getting a what?!

33:41.977 --> 33:44.179
A tattoo.

33:47.533 --> 33:49.184
TINY: In and out
like stealth ninjas.

33:51.153 --> 33:52.720
Emily, are you okay?

33:52.755 --> 33:55.515
Please, please tell me
you did not just
get a tattoo.

33:55.549 --> 33:57.801
What? It's henna.

33:57.835 --> 34:00.245
The guy did it for free
'cause he liked my aura.

34:00.279 --> 34:02.322
- Cool, right?
- Super cool.

34:02.356 --> 34:06.768
So not super cool.
How could you do that
without asking me?

34:06.802 --> 34:08.177
- I asked Lola.
- She did.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.304
Lola... Lola
is nobody, okay?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.699
You can't just
wander off like that.

34:12.733 --> 34:13.909
Something could've
happened to you.

34:13.943 --> 34:16.702
You are my responsibility,
okay?

34:16.737 --> 34:18.521
And that better come off
with soap and water.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.217
- Uh, Jenny.
- What, Bobby?

34:22.251 --> 34:29.975
- Please don't let
them get me.
- Go, go, go, go!

34:30.009 --> 34:31.493
Go, go, go, go!

34:31.527 --> 34:33.561
BOBBY: Go! Come on!

34:35.931 --> 34:37.273
TREY: Why are the pawn shop
guys after us?

34:37.308 --> 34:39.192
KATY: Bobby stole
a candy bar.

34:39.226 --> 34:41.194
- So give it back.
- I can't, I licked it.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.199
- Come this way.
- Bobby!

34:53.907 --> 34:55.125
There.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.796
Go this way.

35:02.766 --> 35:04.751
Sh, sh, sh!

35:04.785 --> 35:05.802
( door creaks open,
slams shut )

35:20.960 --> 35:22.844
They went this way.

35:22.878 --> 35:23.928
You don't know
what way they went.

35:23.963 --> 35:26.072
Sh, sh!

35:31.529 --> 35:32.954
( alarm blares )

35:43.082 --> 35:44.174
We know you're
in here.

36:07.189 --> 36:11.034
Just wanna have
a reasonable conversation.

36:11.068 --> 36:13.870
SCALPER: Yeah, we're
very reasonable people.

36:20.286 --> 36:22.278
TINY: We locked the doors.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.964
There's no way out.

36:55.921 --> 36:58.915
- JENNY: Get down. Lola.
- No way out!

36:58.949 --> 37:01.476
We're not leaving
till we get that camera.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.437
My camera?

37:04.471 --> 37:06.389
These guys are crazy.

37:06.423 --> 37:08.658
We need to find
another way out.

37:08.692 --> 37:10.260
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

37:19.061 --> 37:21.312
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

37:33.450 --> 37:34.617
That's them.
Come on!

37:36.912 --> 37:37.829
KATY: Go away!
Leave us alone!

37:40.023 --> 37:44.226
Get down!
Stop the belt.

37:44.261 --> 37:46.229
BOBBY: Pick on someone
your own size.

37:46.263 --> 37:48.723
You're makin' me jump.

37:48.757 --> 37:49.424
You're not gettin'
my camera.

37:51.193 --> 37:52.135
Give me the camera.

37:55.197 --> 37:57.456
- ( blows raspberry )
- Nice going!

37:57.491 --> 37:58.850
Hey, kids.

38:01.086 --> 38:03.238
- ( laughing )
- JENNY: Careful.

38:03.272 --> 38:06.416
TREY: With your legs,
with your legs.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.900
Let's go.

38:13.423 --> 38:16.109
TREY: This is so cool. Whoo!

38:16.143 --> 38:17.944
KATY: Come on, guys,
let's hurry.

38:17.978 --> 38:20.396
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.848
Come on.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.249
Let's go.

38:36.605 --> 38:37.889
BOBBY: Hey, look out!

39:01.864 --> 39:03.831
Go! Go, go, go.

39:08.704 --> 39:10.129
Go, go. Right.

39:18.806 --> 39:21.641
We can't get around this, guys.
There's no way out.

39:21.675 --> 39:23.084
Yeah, there is.

39:23.118 --> 39:24.685
There's an awesome
way out.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.265
Oh, yeah!

39:29.299 --> 39:31.317
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

39:31.352 --> 39:34.095
HELEN: What an incredible
party.

39:34.129 --> 39:36.130
I can't believe
this is all for me.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.798
Well, you deserve
it all.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.293
There's Barry and Donna.
Let's say hello.

39:40.327 --> 39:42.036
I should give
the kids a call though.

39:42.071 --> 39:44.330
Oh, honey,
they're fine.

39:44.365 --> 39:45.924
I don't know.
A.J. was so upset

39:45.958 --> 39:47.867
about missing
the Roller Derby match.

39:47.901 --> 39:49.402
She must be miserable
and bored.

39:49.436 --> 39:51.712
- Are you ready?
- You bet.

39:56.443 --> 39:58.378
How did you learn
how to do that?

39:58.412 --> 39:59.137
How do you think
I got off the roof?

40:05.169 --> 40:07.186
This outfit is so going
to need dry cleaning.

40:09.864 --> 40:12.884
Your parents are never
going to ask me to
babysit again.

40:12.918 --> 40:14.402
If they do, I'd ask
for ten bucks more an hour.

40:18.932 --> 40:21.525
- Ready?
- Okay.

40:21.559 --> 40:22.910
Jenny!

40:24.246 --> 40:25.371
Right there.

40:45.517 --> 40:47.977
- TINY: Who turned out
the lights?
- Here I come.

40:51.056 --> 40:53.290
- Is everyone okay?
- ( all saying yes )

40:53.325 --> 40:53.900
Let's go sell
that ticket.

40:56.486 --> 40:59.914
TINY: You're on my leg.
My leg, my leg.

40:59.948 --> 41:00.406
I'm having trouble
breathing.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.844
What just happened?

41:13.879 --> 41:15.004
I hate kids.

41:18.350 --> 41:19.967
We could still get 'em
at that concert.

41:20.001 --> 41:22.136
Yeah.

41:29.953 --> 41:31.545
LOLA: Okay, I'm gonna do it.

41:31.579 --> 41:34.198
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

41:34.233 --> 41:37.443
Yeah, people sell
concert tickets every day.
It's no big deal.

41:37.477 --> 41:40.972
Here, kid.
Guard this with your
life, okay?

41:41.006 --> 41:42.248
You can trust me.
I'm a Derby girl.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.158
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

41:44.192 --> 41:45.684
We'll just be over
here by the taco cart.

41:45.719 --> 41:47.962
Oh, tacos.

41:47.996 --> 41:52.399
Maybe my cupcakes
could use some heat.

41:52.434 --> 41:54.210
Jenny, sit on this.

41:58.932 --> 42:01.843
Thanks, Trey.
So thoughtful.

42:01.877 --> 42:03.802
Hundred bucks?

42:03.837 --> 42:06.238
Hey, tickets.
Just 100 bucks.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.640
How about you, beautiful?
a ticket, 100 bucks?

42:10.160 --> 42:11.268
What are you doing, A.J.?
Please be careful.

42:11.303 --> 42:12.728
It's the Swift trip chop.

42:12.763 --> 42:14.413
A right chop
with a back spin.

42:14.448 --> 42:15.548
It's Jailer Swift's
signature move.

42:15.582 --> 42:16.649
Like that would
ever work.

42:22.155 --> 42:23.289
Ticket, ticket.
Hundred bucks. Ticket.

42:23.323 --> 42:26.793
- Concert ticket,
hundred bucks.
- There she is.

42:26.827 --> 42:28.894
Hey, hey.
Hundred bucks, concert ticket.

42:28.929 --> 42:31.197
No, how about you?

42:31.231 --> 42:32.623
Hundred bucks?
You got one already.

42:32.657 --> 42:37.086
Reselling a ticket
at the site of a venue
is illegal.

42:37.121 --> 42:40.898
Did I say sell?
I meant donate.

42:40.932 --> 42:43.893
I was gonna donate
this ticket to a very
deserving person, officer.

42:43.927 --> 42:45.953
Oh, no, no,
not the police.

42:45.987 --> 42:48.631
- Sounds like you're
trying to bribe me.
- No, no, no.

42:48.665 --> 42:49.599
Oh, no!

42:52.627 --> 42:54.161
Stupid kid.
Nabbed by the cops.

42:54.195 --> 42:55.021
I see that.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.909
- Come on.
- Oh, but, sir, I didn't
do it, I swear.

42:59.943 --> 43:01.777
She'd want
a picture of this.

43:12.765 --> 43:14.565
Excuse me, ma'am.

43:14.599 --> 43:16.609
We're looking for
our friend Lola.

43:16.643 --> 43:19.162
She's 19, dark hair,
snappy attitude.

43:19.196 --> 43:19.954
Yeah, she's getting booked.

43:19.988 --> 43:21.848
Booked?

43:21.882 --> 43:25.200
- Is that, like, arrested?
- Like yep.

43:25.235 --> 43:28.128
Have a seat, and we'll
call you when we're
done processing her.

43:28.163 --> 43:32.258
Uh, fat man called Tiny
and a tall, skinny guy

43:32.292 --> 43:34.743
- with a hat.
- Hood.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.787
And a weird little
furry animal thing.

43:36.822 --> 43:37.830
Maybe a ferret.
I don't know.

43:37.864 --> 43:40.633
( sighs )

43:40.667 --> 43:42.610
You are aware that lying
to an officer of the law

43:42.644 --> 43:44.704
is also a crime.

43:44.738 --> 43:46.981
You are aware
I'm not lying, officer.

43:47.015 --> 43:48.240
It's gonna be
a long night, kid.

43:53.188 --> 43:54.355
I'm never gonna find
the perfect ingredient

43:54.389 --> 43:56.666
in time for
the contest.

43:56.700 --> 44:00.978
Quit your whining.
I'm missing the biggest
rivalry in Roller Derby history.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.788
Both of you
quit your whining.

44:02.823 --> 44:04.448
I'm missing the biggest
concert of the year.

44:04.483 --> 44:08.443
Hey, everyone quit whining.
Just sit and be quiet
so I can think.

44:08.478 --> 44:11.330
You're smart,
you are calm,

44:11.364 --> 44:12.823
you always have the answers.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.741
Hey, Jenny.
Can't we just call

44:14.776 --> 44:16.477
one of your friends
for help?

44:16.512 --> 44:19.313
My friends are busy
studying.

44:19.348 --> 44:21.140
What about
your parents?

44:21.174 --> 44:22.650
I told you,
they're out of town.

44:24.485 --> 44:26.562
Emily, what did you do?

44:26.596 --> 44:28.205
Nothing. It's just
a little hair dye.

44:28.239 --> 44:30.049
Just a little
bit of hair dye?

44:30.084 --> 44:31.592
Just a little tattoo.
What is wrong with you?

44:31.627 --> 44:32.969
Why are you being
so irresponsible?

44:33.003 --> 44:34.553
I'm not irresponsible.

44:34.588 --> 44:36.388
You're just making
everything worse.

44:36.423 --> 44:37.790
Now go sit with
the other kids

44:37.825 --> 44:38.499
so I can figure
out what to do.

45:07.904 --> 45:09.805
Okay, you wanted to
teach me a lesson,

45:09.839 --> 45:11.365
and I get it.
I'm sorry.

45:11.399 --> 45:13.459
Can I go now?

45:13.461 --> 45:15.386
I'm not entirely convinced
you do get it, young lady.

45:15.421 --> 45:19.056
You have more than a few
violations on your record.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.968
Parking tickets,
not bank robberies.

45:22.002 --> 45:22.752
This girl giving you
trouble, officer?

45:28.875 --> 45:30.376
Next time, keep the fighting
in the rink

45:30.410 --> 45:31.911
and not
the parking lot.

45:31.945 --> 45:34.063
- They started it.
- Yeah, and we're
gonna finish it.

45:34.097 --> 45:36.273
Enough already.
You three, over there.

45:36.307 --> 45:37.767
The other three, there.

45:39.803 --> 45:42.605
All right.
Thank you.

45:46.501 --> 45:49.170
It's Jailer Swift.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.880
It's you.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.450
- You're my hero.
- Yeah?

45:54.484 --> 45:57.628
I've been trying
to learn the Swift
trip chop for six months.

45:57.662 --> 45:58.204
Let's see what you got.

46:01.541 --> 46:03.801
Not bad, kid, not bad.

46:03.803 --> 46:04.535
But you need some more torque
on that back spin.

46:04.569 --> 46:06.462
Like so.

46:14.379 --> 46:15.471
( man snoring )

46:18.992 --> 46:19.934
( snoring loudly )

46:28.901 --> 46:30.469
Congratulations, Helen.

46:30.503 --> 46:32.897
- Hey. How are you?
- Hi.

46:32.931 --> 46:34.890
- I'm so proud of her.
- I know.

46:34.925 --> 46:36.492
( phone buzzing )

46:39.379 --> 46:41.197
Mom, help.

46:41.231 --> 46:43.549
Jenny stole the Andersons'
new car,

46:43.583 --> 46:45.517
and got us all arrested.

46:45.552 --> 46:46.919
We're downtown
in the city... ( yells )

46:54.461 --> 46:56.387
You were right.

46:56.421 --> 46:57.605
Except for the parking
tickets, you're clean.

46:57.639 --> 46:59.173
See, I told you.
I'm not a felon.

46:59.207 --> 47:01.250
I'm just an innocent
babysitter.

47:01.285 --> 47:03.910
And what kind of example
do you think you're setting
for those kids up there?

47:03.945 --> 47:06.772
- You think it's
one big joke?
- No.

47:06.806 --> 47:09.175
Trying to sell concert tickets
may not be a felony,
but it's dangerous.

47:09.209 --> 47:11.635
Some thug could've
snatched those tickets
and your wallet.

47:11.670 --> 47:13.329
Then what?

47:13.363 --> 47:15.615
I don't know. I guess
I didn't really think of that.

47:15.649 --> 47:16.448
No, you didn't.

47:18.977 --> 47:22.262
Look, you're
a smart girl.

47:22.297 --> 47:23.847
But you need to start
thinking about your actions.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.991
Those kids up there,
they look up to you.

47:26.025 --> 47:27.868
They wanna be you.

47:27.902 --> 47:30.621
They don't even
know me.

47:30.655 --> 47:33.566
I'm not even
their real babysitter.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.442
I lied to get the job,

47:35.477 --> 47:37.127
and I lied to you
earlier.

47:37.162 --> 47:42.124
Officer, I'm not
a Furry Lisa-loving
college student.

47:42.158 --> 47:43.642
I never even heard of
Furry Lisa before today.

47:43.677 --> 47:46.170
"Fur Elise."
Beethoven.

47:46.204 --> 47:48.013
- Right.
- Doesn't matter.

47:48.048 --> 47:49.890
The truth is,
I wanted to go to art school,

47:49.925 --> 47:51.241
but my grades
weren't good enough to get in,

47:51.275 --> 47:52.827
so I didn't even try.

47:52.861 --> 47:55.546
And now I'm up for this amazing
photography internship

47:55.580 --> 47:57.272
with my idol, and...

47:57.306 --> 48:01.168
if I get it, then
I'll have another chance
to make things right.

48:01.202 --> 48:03.812
I really am an artist,

48:03.846 --> 48:06.649
and I really am
a good photographer.

48:06.683 --> 48:08.192
And I'm really sorry
I lied to you,

48:08.226 --> 48:09.785
but you're kinda sorta
super cute,

48:09.819 --> 48:11.954
and I know I always
make mistakes,

48:11.988 --> 48:13.798
and I know this
was a big mistake,

48:13.832 --> 48:16.592
but I just...

48:16.627 --> 48:18.093
I don't think
I belong in jail.

48:20.422 --> 48:21.655
Neither do I.

48:21.689 --> 48:23.390
You don't?

48:23.424 --> 48:25.609
No.

48:25.643 --> 48:27.711
Oh, thank you. Sorry.

48:27.745 --> 48:29.371
So do you need any help
getting those kids home?

48:29.406 --> 48:31.306
- Can I call
their parents--
- No!

48:31.341 --> 48:32.608
- No, we're good.
But thank you.
- Okay.

48:34.936 --> 48:37.904
Let's see if
your friends
are up here.

48:37.939 --> 48:40.332
- Oh, there they are.
- Lola!

48:40.367 --> 48:42.076
You're okay!

48:43.786 --> 48:46.080
Hi, Katy.
Hi, cutie.

48:49.634 --> 48:52.970
- Lola!
- Hi. You guys came.

48:53.005 --> 48:54.046
Say cheese.

48:56.374 --> 48:57.783
- Stop pushing.
- You're blocking my face!

48:57.817 --> 48:58.592
I'll block your face
with my foot.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.143
Come on now.

49:12.407 --> 49:13.816
You guys, get out
of here now. Go, go!

49:18.571 --> 49:20.539
TINY: We gotta
get that camera.

49:20.573 --> 49:22.282
SCALPER: We'll get it.
No matter what.

49:22.316 --> 49:25.627
Look at that. That little one,
she's got the camera.

49:25.661 --> 49:27.504
Get her.
Go, go, go.

49:27.538 --> 49:29.915
JENNY: Come on, guys.

49:29.949 --> 49:32.718
Lola, are you okay?
Was it scary?
Did they hurt you?

49:32.752 --> 49:34.528
No, I'm totally fine.

49:34.562 --> 49:37.689
Fine? You just
got arrested.

49:37.724 --> 49:39.274
It's fine, Jenny.
Relax. It's not a big deal.

49:39.309 --> 49:40.250
This has gone way beyond
sneaking out to a concert.

49:40.285 --> 49:42.511
You guys, I'm sorry,
but we have to call
your parents.

49:42.545 --> 49:45.122
- ALL: No!
- You're just gonna
give up, just like that?

49:45.156 --> 49:47.842
It's called
being responsible.
You should try it sometime.

49:47.876 --> 49:49.292
And you should try
loosening up.

49:49.327 --> 49:50.903
Be in the moment.

49:50.937 --> 49:52.838
Hey, little girl.
Come here.

49:52.872 --> 49:54.148
- Give me that camera.
- You wish!

49:56.868 --> 49:58.544
It worked!

49:58.578 --> 50:00.646
Hey, hey!

50:00.680 --> 50:01.697
Guys!

50:04.659 --> 50:06.994
- ( Lola and Jenny
continue arguing )
- Get her!

50:14.186 --> 50:16.586
Uh, hey, you guys.

50:16.621 --> 50:19.598
- BOTH: What, Bobby?
- Uh, A.J.

50:19.633 --> 50:22.543
Oh, no, A.J.

50:22.577 --> 50:25.262
- Help, police!
- Help!

50:29.300 --> 50:30.726
A.J.

50:32.412 --> 50:33.953
That's their car.

50:33.988 --> 50:36.147
Keys.
Let's take their car.

50:36.182 --> 50:38.050
No, no,
that's stealing.

50:38.084 --> 50:39.459
It's not stealing,
it's borrowing.

50:39.494 --> 50:41.345
Babysitting rule
number two:

50:41.379 --> 50:43.447
Leave no child behind.
Or ahead, right? Yeah.

50:46.117 --> 50:49.269
I can't believe that
you dragged me out of a party

50:49.303 --> 50:51.130
for one of
Emily's pranks.

50:51.164 --> 50:53.081
Police don't
arrest children.

50:53.115 --> 50:54.741
You heard the message.
She sounded terrified.

50:54.775 --> 50:56.927
Taxi!

50:56.961 --> 50:58.603
I'm sure they're
just at home,

50:58.638 --> 51:00.355
absolutely fine,
in front of the TV,

51:00.390 --> 51:02.775
watching some
ridiculous car chase.

51:02.809 --> 51:05.051
( tires screeching )

51:05.086 --> 51:06.336
Hang on, A.J.
We'll save you.

51:06.371 --> 51:09.431
Kids, this is not
how a responsible
babysitter behaves.

51:12.893 --> 51:15.955
A.J.: Excuse me. Sorry.

51:15.989 --> 51:17.189
Hey, lady, look out.

51:19.959 --> 51:20.859
SCALPER:
Out of the way!

- KATY: There's the big guy.

51:31.688 --> 51:32.671
- Get away from my sister.
- Yeah!

51:36.150 --> 51:38.969
Hey, hey.
That's my car!

51:39.003 --> 51:41.588
KATY: Faster, Lola,
faster!

51:43.725 --> 51:45.592
Look! There she is.

51:49.205 --> 51:50.180
We can do this.
Come on.

52:03.778 --> 52:04.820
LOLA: That was close.

52:07.957 --> 52:10.033
Hey! That's our car!

52:16.783 --> 52:18.684
Stupid ferret.

52:18.718 --> 52:20.585
You can do it, Tiny.

52:20.619 --> 52:22.871
Think of the money.
Think of the money.

52:22.905 --> 52:25.090
Professor Helen Anderson.

52:33.958 --> 52:35.100

52:35.134 --> 52:37.169
Oh.

52:37.203 --> 52:38.229

- Okay. Oops.

52:38.263 --> 52:39.813

52:43.376 --> 52:45.985

My phone called
the Andersons.

- ALL: Helen?

52:59.400 --> 53:01.176
Lola, is everything okay?

53:01.210 --> 53:04.196
Oh, totes.

53:04.230 --> 53:06.181
You're checking in

of that before.

53:08.008 --> 53:10.044
Uh, babysitter bonus.

53:10.078 --> 53:11.511

Are you gonna
explain to Helen

53:26.327 --> 53:27.828
why her best friends
missed her speech?

53:27.862 --> 53:30.138
Whoa! Did you see that?

53:30.173 --> 53:33.717
What kind of parent
lets their kid roller skate
in the city after dark?

53:33.751 --> 53:35.577

see in this city.

a battle of the babysitters.

58:30.498 --> 58:33.458
Let's rewind this movie
an hour or two.

58:33.492 --> 58:35.276
The kid snuck out,
I didn't have a clue.

58:35.311 --> 58:37.671
Yeah, that's true.

58:40.466 --> 58:43.568
Okay, I admit it,
I don't follow rules.

58:43.603 --> 58:46.204
I'm not good with kids,
I'm not good at school.

58:46.238 --> 58:48.406
It wasn't my plan
to steal a car,

58:48.441 --> 58:51.200
or end up in jail
or take it this far.

58:51.235 --> 58:53.578
It's true I lied,
but nobody's died.

58:53.613 --> 58:55.781
And these kids are having
an incredible ride.

58:55.783 --> 58:58.358
You think you know it all,
but you don't know me.

58:58.392 --> 59:00.452
See, I'm more than just
Miss Spelling Bee.

59:00.486 --> 59:02.229
You want to be
a real artist,

59:02.263 --> 59:03.980
take pictures, get gritty,

59:04.015 --> 59:06.258
on your first night out
in the big, bad city.

59:06.292 --> 59:09.394
- You're a cool girl, Jenny,
but I'm pretty cool, too.
- Go, Lola, go, Lola.

59:09.428 --> 59:12.789
In fact, I'm just as great
a babysitter as you.

59:12.823 --> 59:14.499
Ha!

59:25.244 --> 59:27.920
She's right, I'm smart,
and I do follow rules.

59:27.955 --> 59:30.774
I work real hard,
and I care about school.

59:30.776 --> 59:32.800
There's a time for fun,
to let go and climb trees,

59:32.835 --> 59:35.028
but I am a real artist;
everybody say cheese.

59:35.063 --> 59:37.238
ALL: Cheese!

59:37.272 --> 59:40.075
We ain't no quitters.

59:40.109 --> 59:41.367
We're the babysitters.

59:41.401 --> 59:44.971
They ain't no quitters.

59:45.005 --> 59:47.373
They're the babysitters.
They're the babysitters.

59:47.407 --> 59:49.667
They ain't no quitters.

59:49.701 --> 59:52.045
They're the babysitters.

59:52.079 --> 59:54.814
They ain't no quitters.

59:54.848 --> 59:57.717
They're the babysitters.
They're the babysitters.

59:57.751 --> 59:59.886
We ain't no quitters.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.088
We're the babysitters.

01:00:01.122 --> 01:00:02.514
That's right.

01:00:02.548 --> 01:00:05.408
They ain't no quitters.

01:00:05.442 --> 01:00:07.811
They're the babysitters,
they're the babysitters.

01:00:07.845 --> 01:00:09.212
They ain't no quitters.

01:00:09.246 --> 01:00:12.632
There they are.
Come on.

01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:14.059
JENNY: Lola, they're here.
Look.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:18.596
Peace out!
Let's go, guys.

01:00:18.631 --> 01:00:20.482
- KATY: Well, good night.
- Come on, kids.

01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:25.787
TINY: Move! Come on.

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:27.030
SCALPER: Out of the way.

01:00:31.185 --> 01:00:32.619
Those are our kids.
Can we just...

01:00:35.973 --> 01:00:38.675
Stop in your tracks.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.710
'Cause you ain't goin' nowhere
till we get the facts!

01:00:42.988 --> 01:00:44.089
Facts?

01:00:46.675 --> 01:00:48.443
Jenny, you were great!

01:00:48.477 --> 01:00:52.238
- That was amazing.
- I can't believe
I just did that.

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.940
See what happens
when you just let go?

01:00:53.974 --> 01:00:54.941
The art just
starts to flow.

01:00:54.975 --> 01:00:56.918
Well, speaking of flow,

01:00:56.952 --> 01:00:59.745
we better get going before
these guys come out, all right?

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.006
Jenny, you were
way cool.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.584
TREY: Not cool.
You were radical!

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.736
She didn't end
world hunger, people.

01:01:08.622 --> 01:01:10.415
Yeah, I just
came on shift,

01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:11.357
but let me check, okay?

01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:13.125
Yeah, all right.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.013
George, got any kids
locked up in the back,
or babysitters?

01:01:17.047 --> 01:01:19.524
None yet.

01:01:19.558 --> 01:01:21.284
We don't usually
lock up the children

01:01:21.319 --> 01:01:23.837
- until after midnight.
- ( both laughing )

01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:28.133
I'm sorry.

01:01:31.645 --> 01:01:32.763
This was mama's
one night out.

01:01:32.797 --> 01:01:34.139
Thanks, fellas.

01:01:38.552 --> 01:01:41.479
- LOLA: That was really great.
I am so proud of you.
- JENNY: Thanks.

01:01:47.127 --> 01:01:49.821
Hey, you should
talk to Emily.
She seems pretty down.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:56.561
Hey, um, I just wanted
to apologize about earlier

01:01:56.595 --> 01:01:57.846
back at the police station.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.155
Whatever.

01:01:59.189 --> 01:02:01.391
Just forget it.

01:02:01.425 --> 01:02:03.542
No, I won't forget it.

01:02:03.577 --> 01:02:05.811
It's been an awful night,

01:02:05.846 --> 01:02:07.280
but it's no excuse
to hurt your feelings.

01:02:07.315 --> 01:02:09.666
You're not a child.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.818
You're an amazing,
smart, cool girl.

01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:14.612
No, I'm just a dork.

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.697
Nobody even knows
I exist.

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.192
I'm just
an invisible dork.

01:02:19.226 --> 01:02:21.928
You're not invisible.
You're beautiful.

01:02:21.963 --> 01:02:25.640
And you don't need
green hair or tattoos
to be noticed.

01:02:25.674 --> 01:02:28.176
Just be your
awesome self.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.694
I promise you,
it's enough.

01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:36.910
If he doesn't
see that, then...

01:02:36.944 --> 01:02:38.077
that's his loss.

01:02:40.431 --> 01:02:43.041
Besides...

01:02:46.036 --> 01:02:47.954
boys are dorks.

01:02:47.988 --> 01:02:49.881
They are dorks.

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:52.967
Thanks, Jenny.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:59.374
Um, Jenny.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:02.694
I have something I should
probably tell you.

01:03:02.728 --> 01:03:06.297
Maybe she meant
the North Park station.

01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:07.899
- It's not that far--
- No, no, no.

01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:09.634
Absolutely not.

01:03:09.668 --> 01:03:11.644
Barry, I am tired,
I'm cold.

01:03:11.678 --> 01:03:14.072
My feet are numb.

01:03:17.868 --> 01:03:20.186
Barry, why didn't
you tell me

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.604
that I was wearing
two different shoes?

01:03:21.638 --> 01:03:23.823
I thought it was
a fashion choice.

01:03:23.857 --> 01:03:26.885
You called
your parents?!

01:03:26.919 --> 01:03:29.429
- I'm sorry.
- She called the parents.

01:03:29.463 --> 01:03:30.388
That's it, it's over.

01:03:30.423 --> 01:03:31.548
BARRY: Taxi.

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:34.884
That girl looks
like Emily.

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:41.440
She's got green hair.
You're exhausted.

01:03:41.475 --> 01:03:44.644
Emily, you have to
call them back and
tell them it was a prank.

01:03:44.678 --> 01:03:45.353
Here, use mine.

01:03:51.235 --> 01:03:53.728
- Come on.
- ( line ringing )

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:56.939
We'd have gotten back
faster if we walked.

01:03:56.974 --> 01:03:58.566
Of course, we can't walk
because of my shoes.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.851
Finally.
Maybe it's Jenny.

01:04:00.886 --> 01:04:03.804
( phone buzzing )

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.731
L. Perez.
I don't know any L. Perez.

01:04:05.765 --> 01:04:08.542
I'm not answering.
Stop.

01:04:08.577 --> 01:04:11.279
<i>Hi, you've reached...</i>

01:04:11.313 --> 01:04:13.906
- Didn't answer.
- Great. There goes that plan.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.083
Can't you just
delete the message?

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.260
How? I don't
know the code.

01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:21.539
Mom and Dad are at
the planetarium.

01:04:21.573 --> 01:04:23.032
It's not that
far from here.

01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.058
Yeah, let's just
sneak into the party,

01:04:24.092 --> 01:04:26.602
find your mom's phone and delete
the message ourselves.

01:04:26.637 --> 01:04:28.713
Ooh, sure, no problem,
MacGyver.

01:04:28.747 --> 01:04:30.590
I'll just take out
the security guards

01:04:30.624 --> 01:04:32.099
with my Taser gun,
and then,

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.926
Katy here can shimmy in
through the air ducts.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.870
I'm not dressed
to shimmy.

01:04:35.904 --> 01:04:37.922
Are you always
this negative?

01:04:37.956 --> 01:04:40.750
You can't even consider
an idea that's a little
bit outside the box?

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:42.894
Outside of the box?
You just got outside of jail.

01:04:42.928 --> 01:04:45.021
Now you wanna
crash a gala?

01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:46.355
Even if we could make it,
there's no chance

01:04:46.389 --> 01:04:47.924
we'd get
the money in time.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:51.494
Katy's three-star
party survival kit.

01:04:51.528 --> 01:04:53.296
Mommy keeps
a hundred-dollar bill

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.223
- in her fancy coat pocket.
- Yes, Katy!

01:04:55.257 --> 01:04:56.675
No, it's too dangerous.

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:58.635
Come on, Jenny.

01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:01.179
There are moments in life
where you just have to
take a risk

01:05:01.213 --> 01:05:03.690
and go for it.

01:05:03.724 --> 01:05:05.475
This is one of
those moments.

01:05:37.282 --> 01:05:39.750
What brings
you kids here?

01:05:39.785 --> 01:05:41.519
We're going to steal
money from my mommy's...

01:05:41.553 --> 01:05:43.279
Kids. They are so cute.

01:05:43.313 --> 01:05:46.123
We're babysitters just taking
a little evening field trip

01:05:46.158 --> 01:05:48.209
to the planetarium.

01:05:48.243 --> 01:05:50.811
Field trip?
At this hour?

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:51.937
Dude, Jupiter's
at opposition.

01:05:51.972 --> 01:05:54.557
Best time to observe it.

01:05:54.592 --> 01:05:56.234
You're right.
You really know your stuff.

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:01.197
My mom's
a scientist.

01:06:08.438 --> 01:06:09.414
Go, go.

01:06:12.484 --> 01:06:13.476
Finally.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:14.961
My people.

01:06:17.255 --> 01:06:19.015
Lucky I wore diamonds.

01:06:19.049 --> 01:06:21.417
No, Katy, you didn't.

01:06:21.451 --> 01:06:23.936
Really?

01:06:23.971 --> 01:06:26.389
It's Friday night.
What did you expect
me to wear, pearls?

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.893
- Hey, it's Mom.
- Where?

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:35.665
Oh, no, this is
a nightmare.

01:06:35.699 --> 01:06:38.443
No, it's actually
a really good picture.
It's intense.

01:06:38.477 --> 01:06:40.053
Not the picture.

01:06:40.087 --> 01:06:42.121
If she sees me, I'll never
get that recommendation letter.

01:06:42.156 --> 01:06:45.458
How did you forget
the Andersons were
gonna be here tonight?

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.777
I didn't forget.
I have it right
here on this note.

01:06:47.811 --> 01:06:50.521
Where's the note?

01:06:50.555 --> 01:06:54.725
National Science Foundation
Celestial Ball.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.335
This must be
our lucky night.

01:06:59.131 --> 01:07:00.590
It sure is.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.889
Ah, do you smell that?

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:08.639
Fresh oregano
and a hint of red pepper.

01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.602
Jenny, coat room's
over there.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.360
Everyone duck and cover.
Let's go.

01:07:20.394 --> 01:07:21.444
Go!

01:07:46.236 --> 01:07:47.637
And these are
my people.

01:07:52.642 --> 01:07:55.336
Oh! I can't serve this.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.837
It's original
creation.

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:59.365
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.133
It's dog poop.

01:08:01.168 --> 01:08:04.278
You are dog poop.

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:08.241
I quit!

01:08:10.919 --> 01:08:13.754
( speaking French )

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:16.541
What's taking so long?
The guests are waiting
for dessert.

01:08:16.575 --> 01:08:18.792
( stammering )

01:08:22.872 --> 01:08:26.075
Okay, I'll distract
the coat check person,
Jenny, you find the coat.

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:27.859
Great, good. Okay.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.553
Uh, everyone,
stay in here.

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:30.805
Trey, Emily,
keep an eye on the... kids.

01:08:30.839 --> 01:08:32.305
Where's Bobby?

01:08:37.312 --> 01:08:39.046
I need sea salt
and Mexican chocolate.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.197
Freshly grated,
of course.

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:42.174
Who are you?

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:44.210
Assistant pastry chef,
dude... sir.

01:08:44.243 --> 01:08:47.337
Hurry. Go!

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:48.447
Sea salt!

01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:52.176
Oh, my gosh,
what's he doing?

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:53.877
It's fine; let the kid
do his thing.

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.237
We gotta buy some time.

01:08:55.272 --> 01:08:57.674
- I wanna go
to the party, too.
- Absolutely not, Katy.

01:08:57.707 --> 01:09:02.670
Do you remember what my mommy's
fancy coat looks like?

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.964
You're good.
Let's go.

01:09:06.808 --> 01:09:08.091
Sea salt!

01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:14.031
Thank you.

01:09:14.064 --> 01:09:18.210
I can't believe you thought
our kids were in the city jail.

01:09:18.243 --> 01:09:21.848
Let's just get our coats
and go home.

01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:23.090
- It's Mommy.
- Katy.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.709
It's your kids, too.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.519
It's Jenny.

01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:28.377
Where?

01:09:28.412 --> 01:09:30.747
No, she's not
here, Barry.

01:09:30.782 --> 01:09:32.000
I mean, Jenny is
babysitting.

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:35.144
She's the most responsible
babysitter in the world.

01:09:35.178 --> 01:09:37.296
If anything was wrong,
she would've called us.

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:39.624
Jenny.
There it is.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:42.835
- Oh, no!
- She's coming!

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.513
BARRY: I still
wanna go home.

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:56.907
Fine. Go home.

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.400
I'm going
to get dessert.

01:09:58.435 --> 01:09:59.477
You do that.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.747
I have to eat
dessert now.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.491
Great. There goes
our cash.

01:10:05.525 --> 01:10:06.692
Why don't we just
go get it?

01:10:06.726 --> 01:10:08.653
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the Coopers
will recognize me.

01:10:12.399 --> 01:10:14.075
But...

01:10:15.585 --> 01:10:18.954
But what?

01:10:18.989 --> 01:10:21.215
Uh, I never wear heels.

01:10:21.249 --> 01:10:23.659
It's easy, you just
stand on your toes.

01:10:23.693 --> 01:10:25.670
Okay.

01:10:25.704 --> 01:10:27.513
How do I look?

01:10:27.547 --> 01:10:29.382
Almost. Not quite.
Come here.

01:10:35.705 --> 01:10:38.065
Okay.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.492
Here we go.

01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:43.362
No, no, there's no way
I'm doing this.

01:10:43.396 --> 01:10:45.389
- This is never gonna--
- Come on, Lola.

01:10:45.423 --> 01:10:49.552
There are moments in life
when you just have to take
a risk and go for it.

01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:52.113
This is one of
those moments.

01:10:56.234 --> 01:10:57.410
No.

01:10:59.196 --> 01:11:00.538
Absolutely not.

01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:05.183
Even worse.

01:11:05.218 --> 01:11:07.870
- What is this?
- Celery leaf.

01:11:07.904 --> 01:11:10.698
I don't ever wanna
see this again.

01:11:10.732 --> 01:11:13.843
Will somebody bring me
something innovative?

01:11:15.387 --> 01:11:16.429
Innovative!

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:30.985
That's it!

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.476
Crushed seaweed.
It's so innovative.

01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:42.262
I hear he's from
the Culinary Institute.
Some sort of prodigy.

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.874
It's all about
the perfect ingredient.

01:11:44.908 --> 01:11:46.417
It sure is, kid.

01:11:49.228 --> 01:11:51.697
Can I help you,
gentlemen?

01:11:51.731 --> 01:11:53.624
Yeah, you see some kids
come in here?

01:11:53.658 --> 01:11:55.584
Who wants to know?

01:11:55.618 --> 01:11:57.828
Uh...

01:11:57.863 --> 01:11:59.404
We're their uncles.

01:11:59.439 --> 01:12:02.291
Their parents sent us
to pick them up.

01:12:02.325 --> 01:12:04.060
I think you better
wait here.

01:12:09.307 --> 01:12:11.383
Hey!

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:13.177
Yeah, this is Eugene
in the lobby.

01:12:13.211 --> 01:12:16.422
I got two suspicious subjects
heading into Sky Pavilion.

01:12:16.456 --> 01:12:18.407
I may need back-up.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.793
( British accent )
Hello, darling. Lovely party.

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.940
Where is she?

01:12:42.974 --> 01:12:44.016
Look at all the dresses.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:50.147
( British accent )
Hello, all.
Fabulous gala.

01:12:50.182 --> 01:12:54.126
Oh, what about
that piano player?

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:55.945
Wasn't that "Fur Elise"
he was playing earlier?

01:12:55.979 --> 01:12:58.739
I don't know.

01:12:58.773 --> 01:13:00.741
All I know is
this mousse is incredible.

01:13:04.555 --> 01:13:06.213
Oh, there's Lola.

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:07.748
Tastes good.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.711
Let me see.

01:13:14.631 --> 01:13:16.465
- KATY: She looks so pretty.
- JENNY: Thanks to you.

01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.422
Oh, I love your earrings.

01:13:23.457 --> 01:13:25.249
My husband gave me a pair
just like that.

01:13:25.283 --> 01:13:28.101
He told me they were
one of a kind.

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:30.287
That's what
I was told.

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:32.056
These were a gift
from my boyfriend.

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:33.949
He's a police officer,
a rookie.

01:13:33.984 --> 01:13:35.300
So handsome.

01:13:35.335 --> 01:13:37.077
How nice.

01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:39.972
Oh, I adore your coat.

01:13:40.007 --> 01:13:42.366
Is this real wool?

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.160
No, it's cashmere.
That's what you told me.

01:13:45.195 --> 01:13:46.703
Clumsy me.
I'll get it.

01:13:46.738 --> 01:13:48.497
That's what it says
on the tag.

01:13:48.531 --> 01:13:50.516
Okay, fine, so they're not
one of a kind.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:51.959
- You don't have to
lie about it.
- I didn't.

01:13:51.993 --> 01:13:54.512
I swear, honey.

01:13:54.546 --> 01:13:56.205
You know what, it's fine,
I don't care.

01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:59.475
Let's just have fun.
I wanna enjoy what's
left of the evening.

01:13:59.509 --> 01:14:00.993
This dessert,
it's a lot of fun.

01:14:01.027 --> 01:14:02.712
Well, if you'll
excuse me.

01:14:02.746 --> 01:14:04.722
Nature calls.
Toodles.

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:13.022
- Give me the camera.
- This is not mine.

01:14:21.072 --> 01:14:23.766
You brought the ferret!

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.477
I ain't leavin'
100 grand in the car.

01:14:26.511 --> 01:14:27.703
We gotta stop him
before he gets away.

01:14:31.007 --> 01:14:32.767
- Oh, sorry.
- Nice party.

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.710
( people screaming )

01:14:34.745 --> 01:14:36.629
TINY: Come here, buddy.
Come on.

01:14:41.026 --> 01:14:43.769
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:14:43.804 --> 01:14:45.896
Oh, come here.

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:47.372
You little ferret,
come here.

01:14:47.406 --> 01:14:49.100
Come here.
Come to Tiny.

01:14:49.134 --> 01:14:51.060
Come to Tiny.

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:05.491
( notes playing
discordantly )

01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:14.291
Oh, my God!

01:15:17.495 --> 01:15:20.306
- There he goes. Yay!
- He's on my foot.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.632
He's on my foot,
he's on my foot.

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:22.466
He's on my foot.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.022
I hope we're not
missing anything.

01:15:37.056 --> 01:15:39.892
What?

01:15:39.926 --> 01:15:41.735
Nothing.
Crouton?

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:50.919
So... why did you want
to do that to your hair?

01:15:50.954 --> 01:15:53.063
I don't know.

01:15:53.098 --> 01:15:54.957
Because.

01:15:54.991 --> 01:15:57.609
I'm... boring.

01:15:57.644 --> 01:15:58.727
You're not boring.

01:15:58.761 --> 01:16:00.079
Yes, I am.

01:16:00.113 --> 01:16:03.106
No, you're not.

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.991
Tell you the truth,
I think you're pretty cool.

01:16:05.026 --> 01:16:06.877
You do?

01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:08.954
Yeah.

01:16:08.988 --> 01:16:10.706
Your music's
what's boring.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:13.309
- It is not.
- Yeah, it is.

01:16:13.343 --> 01:16:14.743
Yours is boring.

01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:17.287
Come on, guys.
Time to go.

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:18.222
- Time to go.
- We got the money.
Come on.

01:16:18.256 --> 01:16:20.816
A.J., let's go,
come on.

01:16:20.851 --> 01:16:22.818
I'm gonna get you
when we get out.

01:16:22.852 --> 01:16:25.087
If you could drive
more than five
miles an hour...

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:27.147
You just had to let
the ferret get away.

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:29.508
- Hey, isn't that...
- ( arguing continues )

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:30.534
It's a long story.
No time. Come on.

01:16:37.809 --> 01:16:40.886
Uh-huh. A big, fat man
named Tiny,

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.863
a tall, skinny guy
in a hood,

01:16:42.897 --> 01:16:44.823
and a rare
sapphire ferret.

01:16:44.857 --> 01:16:46.208
MAN: <i>  Yeah, can you</i>
<i>believe that?</i>

01:16:46.242 --> 01:16:47.051
Yeah, actually,
I do believe you.

01:16:48.695 --> 01:16:51.571
( kids laughing )

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.608
LOLA: We did it!
I can't believe it.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:57.410
And with an extra 20 bucks
to get to the tow yard.

01:16:57.445 --> 01:16:59.697
How did you get
an extra 20?

01:16:59.731 --> 01:17:01.298
Smart babysitters
check both pockets.

01:17:01.332 --> 01:17:04.718
Nice going.
You know, we actually
make a pretty good team.

01:17:04.752 --> 01:17:05.444
- We do, don't we?
- Wait.

01:17:09.482 --> 01:17:11.542
You know, I really
underestimated you, Jen.

01:17:11.576 --> 01:17:13.711
Underneath all this
stifled perfection,

01:17:13.745 --> 01:17:16.205
- there's a really
cool chick.
- Thanks, Lola.

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:18.723
Yeah, I can totally see
why that guy asked you
to the concert.

01:17:18.758 --> 01:17:20.258
It makes so much
sense now.

01:17:20.293 --> 01:17:22.870
What... guy?

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:26.665
Uh, uh, I think
his name was Zeke.

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.293
- Zac.
- Yeah, uh...
Sounds about right.

01:17:29.327 --> 01:17:30.920
Zac Chase invited me
to a concert?

01:17:30.954 --> 01:17:33.488
How could you
not tell me?

01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:35.824
- I forgot.
- You forgot.

01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:37.784
That was only the single
most important phone call

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:39.812
of my life.
What did you say?

01:17:39.846 --> 01:17:43.232
Uh, not much.

01:17:43.266 --> 01:17:46.518
Uh, I might've implied
that you possibly

01:17:46.552 --> 01:17:48.437
weren't interested in him.

01:17:48.471 --> 01:17:50.947
What?

01:17:50.982 --> 01:17:52.474
Why would you
do that?

01:17:52.509 --> 01:17:55.477
I was distracted.

01:17:55.511 --> 01:17:57.671
You saw how cute
Officer James is.

01:17:57.705 --> 01:17:59.414
I'm sorry, Jenny,
I didn't mean to...

01:17:59.449 --> 01:18:01.442
That's great.
That's great because

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:03.685
now he's there with
Dominique Cassidy.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.487
That should've been me
at that concert.

01:18:05.521 --> 01:18:07.389
Maybe it's not
too late.

01:18:07.423 --> 01:18:08.957
Of course it's too late.

01:18:08.992 --> 01:18:11.627
That show is almost over,
and now, we have to get the car

01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:12.887
and get back home.

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.771
Just forget it.

01:18:14.805 --> 01:18:16.656
No, I won't.
Taxi!

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:19.593
- Taxi!
- What are you doing?

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.687
The right thing.
You guys, come on, let's go.

01:18:21.721 --> 01:18:23.547
Come on, there's still
time if we hurry.

01:18:23.581 --> 01:18:27.517
You don't have to worry about
those guys anymore, buddy.

01:18:27.552 --> 01:18:30.053
- I'm gonna get you home.
- ( chittering )

01:18:30.088 --> 01:18:33.240
You guys won't be kidnapping
any more exotic animals
where you're going.

01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:36.426
Hey, Hal, I have
a message from
the security company.

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:38.245
They said the alarm
went off at the house earlier,

01:18:38.279 --> 01:18:41.106
- and the babysitter's
not answering.
- Try the home phone.

01:18:41.141 --> 01:18:45.377
( phone ringing )

01:18:49.048 --> 01:18:52.885
( ringing continues )

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:03.787
Wait, wait.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.730
We don't even
have tickets.

01:19:05.765 --> 01:19:07.725
Just let me
handle this, okay?

01:19:07.759 --> 01:19:10.211
Just for once,
trust me.

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:11.645
- Hi.
- Ticket.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.324
No, but what's it
gonna take to get
all of us in?

01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:19.787
You know you can't
take your camera in, right?

01:19:21.722 --> 01:19:23.373
Give it to me,
and I'll let you all in.

01:19:27.354 --> 01:19:29.413
Right. Right, yeah.

01:19:29.447 --> 01:19:31.223
Of course. Yeah.

01:19:31.257 --> 01:19:33.008
I'll just take
the memory card.

01:19:33.042 --> 01:19:35.302
No, no. Stop.

01:19:35.336 --> 01:19:38.563
You can't do that.
That means too much
to you, Lola.

Just look at everything

You risked your life,
you went to jail,

you stole a car,
rapped onstage,

01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:13.617
you crashed a gala
and fought off criminals.

01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:15.227
Talking to a boy

Of course.
Now go get him.

MUSICIAN: Thank you.
Good night!

01:21:27.181 --> 01:21:28.465
It's over.
What do I do?

01:21:28.499 --> 01:21:30.509
Go. Go get him, Jenny!

01:21:30.543 --> 01:21:32.810
Go! Just go find him.

01:21:32.845 --> 01:21:34.254

Jenny?

doing here?
- Looking for you.

01:21:56.594 --> 01:21:58.637
Me? But you told me
to get lost.

01:21:58.671 --> 01:22:00.422
No, it wasn't me.
Someone else had my phone.

01:22:00.456 --> 01:22:02.007
I would've said yes.

01:22:02.041 --> 01:22:03.850
You would?

Hi.

Hi.

You look beautiful.

Thanks.

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:28.692
I really have to go.

01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:30.636
But you just got here.

01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:33.555
I know. It's a long story...

01:22:33.589 --> 01:22:35.766
and a long night.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.467
I just wanted you
to know the truth.

01:22:37.501 --> 01:22:39.569
And I really
have to go now.

01:22:39.604 --> 01:22:40.570
Then I'll come with you.

01:22:40.605 --> 01:22:42.748
But what about Dominique?

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:45.850
Dominique? No, she
left early with her boyfriend.

01:22:45.885 --> 01:22:48.561
She has a boyfriend?

KIDS: Jenny. Jenny!

01:22:50.439 --> 01:22:52.040
- Jenny.
- Jenny!

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:56.169
Jenny, I got a missed call
from the Andersons,

01:22:56.203 --> 01:22:58.430
but I thought we should
listen to the message together.

01:22:58.464 --> 01:22:59.256
All right. Put it
on speaker.

01:23:03.336 --> 01:23:06.029
Hi, guys.
This is Zac.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.106
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I'm sort of babysitting.

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.050
Wow. Their parents must
really trust you

01:23:10.084 --> 01:23:11.668
to take their kids
into the city.

01:23:11.702 --> 01:23:14.404
Okay, guys,
here it is.

01:23:14.438 --> 01:23:15.913
<i>Lola, the security company</i>
<i>called.</i>

01:23:15.948 --> 01:23:17.783
<i>The alarm went off earlier,</i>

01:23:17.817 --> 01:23:19.109
<i>no one's answering</i>
<i>at the house,</i>

01:23:19.143 --> 01:23:20.268
<i>and we just heard from</i>
<i>the Coopers</i>

01:23:20.303 --> 01:23:22.979
<i>who are looking for</i>
<i>their kids in the city jail.</i>

01:23:23.014 --> 01:23:24.356
<i>- We're on our way home.</i>
- I knew it.

01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:26.834
I knew this would happen.
I knew we would've
been home by now

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:29.160
if I hadn't broken
the most important
rule of all.

01:23:29.195 --> 01:23:30.037
You never put a boy
before kids.

01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:36.292
No, it's my fault.
I talked you into it.

01:23:36.327 --> 01:23:38.128
I practically forced you.

01:23:38.163 --> 01:23:39.655
I never should've
taken this job.

01:23:39.689 --> 01:23:41.639
I thought babysitting
was the easiest job
in the world,

01:23:41.674 --> 01:23:43.876
but it's not.

01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:45.201
Jenny, I'll take
full responsibility.

01:23:45.236 --> 01:23:47.137
I'll tell the truth.

01:23:47.171 --> 01:23:49.189
You didn't recommend me,
we're not friends.

01:23:49.223 --> 01:23:52.058
I lied about everything.

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:54.803
Let's just turn
ourselves in.

01:23:54.837 --> 01:23:57.573
For once, I agree with you.

01:23:57.607 --> 01:23:59.424
- Now just wait
one minute.
- Yeah.

01:23:59.459 --> 01:24:03.236
We've spent the whole night
listening to you two
argue and whine.

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:05.997
But you two aren't
the only ones with
something to lose.

01:24:06.031 --> 01:24:08.591
- We're not?
- Hello!

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:10.243
I snuck out
to a concert.

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.412
I skated off
in the city by myself.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:14.056
I used the stove.
Started a fire.

01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:16.066
Impersonated a chef.

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.110
I took my mommy's
favorite diamond earrings.

01:24:19.144 --> 01:24:20.904
I dyed my hair green,
got a tattoo,

01:24:20.938 --> 01:24:23.373
and told my parents
we were in jail.

01:24:23.407 --> 01:24:26.910
- I'm sorry, guys.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:24:26.944 --> 01:24:28.445
There's no way
we'll make it.

01:24:28.479 --> 01:24:30.847
Not if we don't try.

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.553
BOTH: We ain't no quitters.

01:24:36.587 --> 01:24:38.655
Uh, we're the babysitters.

01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:42.033
- All right, Zac,
how big is your car?
- Let's go.

01:24:42.068 --> 01:24:44.027
How long do you think
it'll take to get
to the tow yard?

01:24:48.758 --> 01:24:50.742
Wait! Wait, stop!

01:24:50.776 --> 01:24:52.853
( kids yelling )

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.579
KATY: Our mom's gonna be
so mad at us. Come on.

01:24:56.632 --> 01:24:58.266
Just wait.

01:24:58.301 --> 01:24:59.876
Wait. We're here.
Hey, lady.

01:24:59.911 --> 01:25:02.037
We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

01:25:02.071 --> 01:25:04.131
We have the money.
Just give us the car.
We'll be on our way.

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:05.824
Look, girlie...

01:25:05.858 --> 01:25:07.784
I'm tired,
my feet hurt,

01:25:07.818 --> 01:25:09.694
and my truck
has a flat.

01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:12.488
I've had
a really long night.

01:25:12.523 --> 01:25:14.216
<i>You've</i>  had a long night?!

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:16.059
Yeah, so don't
mess with Trixie.

01:25:18.304 --> 01:25:19.813
Don't mess with
the babysitter.

up, right?
- KIDS: Yes!

Okay, cool, we gotta get
home before your parents
do, so hold on.

01:25:45.114 --> 01:25:46.497
Finally!

01:25:46.532 --> 01:25:48.717
- They could stand
to hire some more help.
- I know.

01:25:58.628 --> 01:26:00.445
All right, kiddies,
we gotta move.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:01.947
Trey, I need you
to get the hose,
rinse off the car.

01:26:01.981 --> 01:26:03.681
I'll put it in
the garage later.

01:26:03.715 --> 01:26:05.767
Everybody else, get inside,
get on your pajamas fast.
Let's go!

01:26:21.475 --> 01:26:25.429
Okay, Emily, get that dog
into a tub and start scrubbing,

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:26.604
and scrub your head
and arms while you're at it.

01:26:26.638 --> 01:26:29.324
Jenny, Katy, get some towels,
start mopping up those suds.

I was speeding,

there's a very
good reason.

I've had a really...

01:29:22.932 --> 01:29:25.225
Driving without a license
is illegal.

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:29.120
Okay, seriously,
you really need
to take a night off.

01:29:29.154 --> 01:29:30.956
That's a great idea.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:32.807

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.570
Yeah, yeah,
Saturday works.

01:29:53.913 --> 01:29:56.881
Zac. What are you
doing here?

01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:58.617
Um, returning
Emily's headphones.

01:29:58.651 --> 01:30:00.977
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe
she would've forgotten those.

01:30:01.011 --> 01:30:04.089
She technically didn't.

01:30:04.123 --> 01:30:04.955
I asked her if I could
keep them.

01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:07.392
You did?

01:30:07.426 --> 01:30:09.594
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:30:09.628 --> 01:30:12.096
Um, so I could return them.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:14.165
Right.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.926
- And see you.
- EMILY: Ask her out.

01:30:16.961 --> 01:30:18.886
Ask <i>  him</i>  out!

01:30:18.921 --> 01:30:20.488
( both giggling )

01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:24.651
Do you...

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:27.220
- Wanna go out with me?
- With me?

01:30:27.254 --> 01:30:28.738
BOTH: Yes?

01:30:28.772 --> 01:30:30.631
Yeah?

01:30:30.666 --> 01:30:32.625
( giggling )

01:30:43.328 --> 01:30:45.463
Okay.

01:30:45.497 --> 01:30:47.298
Great, Zac.
I'll see you tonight.

01:30:47.332 --> 01:30:48.891
Um, you're
a little late.

01:30:48.926 --> 01:30:50.735
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

01:30:50.769 --> 01:30:52.353
Sorry. I guess I just
needed to sleep in

01:30:52.388 --> 01:30:54.047
after my date
with Zac last night.

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:56.616
Aw, I'm really happy
for you guys.

01:30:56.650 --> 01:30:58.677
And I want you
to know, Jenny,

01:30:58.711 --> 01:31:03.106
whatever happens today,
whoever Leon picks,
I'm okay.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:07.268
Thank you, but
you were right, Lola.

01:31:07.302 --> 01:31:09.270
I didn't even know
who Leon Vasquez was

01:31:09.304 --> 01:31:11.331
before I read about
this internship.

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:14.876
I like photography,
but no, I don't love it.

01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:16.670
Not like you.

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:19.556
I called earlier

01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:21.049
and officially withdrew
my application.

01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:25.945
I'm taking
the summer off.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.406
What about college
and early admission

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.041
and your transcripts?

01:31:30.075 --> 01:31:31.609
What about fun
and free time,

01:31:31.643 --> 01:31:33.319
and living outside
of the box?

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:36.448
Well, uh...

01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:37.882
since you're such an expert
at this college stuff,

01:31:37.916 --> 01:31:42.479
maybe you could help me with
my art school applications.

01:31:42.513 --> 01:31:44.280
Sure. Friends help
friends, right?

01:31:44.314 --> 01:31:46.099
Yeah.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:49.027
And if you ever need
a recommendation
as a babysitter,

01:31:49.061 --> 01:31:51.379
feel free to use my name.

01:31:51.413 --> 01:31:52.947
I think I should
probably retire.

01:31:52.981 --> 01:31:55.158
Gotcha.

01:31:55.192 --> 01:31:57.769
Um, hey, could you
send me the pictures
from the other night?

01:31:57.803 --> 01:32:01.172
Yeah, of course.
I'll send them over
to everyone. Come here.

01:32:07.396 --> 01:32:09.530
What's this?

01:32:09.565 --> 01:32:12.684
Just me being
spontaneous.

01:32:18.106 --> 01:32:20.074
Um, I'll see you soon.

01:32:20.108 --> 01:32:21.192
Yeah, I'll see you soon.
