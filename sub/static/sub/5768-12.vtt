00:16.517 --> 00:19.085
Grace!

00:19.086 --> 00:20.487
Homework?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.021
Nope.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.089
Campaign?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.957
- I already did my homework, Mom.
- I know.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.459
How's Dad doing?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.528
He's good.
I don't see much of him, though.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.329
It's mostly...

00:31.599 --> 00:32.898
What?

00:32.899 --> 00:34.900
- Nothing.
- Morning, Mom.

00:34.901 --> 00:37.135
- I have to call Eli.
- Hi.

00:38.037 --> 00:39.221
I don't need breakfast.

00:39.222 --> 00:40.606
Too bad. You're getting it.
Sit down.

00:40.607 --> 00:41.624
What's he doing?

00:41.625 --> 00:43.753
I don't know.
I've given up on parenting.

00:43.754 --> 00:46.328
- How'd you sleep?
- Well.

00:46.329 --> 00:47.596
You look good.

00:47.597 --> 00:48.796
- I look...?
- Yeah.

00:48.797 --> 00:51.699
Your hair--
it's-it's cool.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.034
Uh, Eli Gold, please.

00:53.035 --> 00:55.303
No, no, tell him it's important.

00:55.304 --> 00:57.305
For those of you who don't know Jordan,

00:57.306 --> 00:59.374
he was chief of staff to Barbara Boxer

00:59.375 --> 01:01.108
and has worked on three California

01:01.109 --> 01:02.810
senatorial campaigns.

01:02.811 --> 01:03.978
Hello, print journalists.

01:03.979 --> 01:06.980
How does it feel
to perpetuate a dying medium?

01:06.981 --> 01:09.616
Does this mean the candidate
has lost faith in you, Eli?

01:09.617 --> 01:11.818
No. It means we're expanding.

01:11.819 --> 01:13.353
Let me, uh, backstop that.

01:13.354 --> 01:15.790
There's been absolutely
no loss of confidence in Eli.

01:15.791 --> 01:18.292
But Maddie Hayward
is gaining on you in the polls.

01:18.293 --> 01:19.993
That's just a temporary novelty bounce.

01:19.994 --> 01:21.561
Yeah, Zach, is this important?

01:21.562 --> 01:24.007
I think so. I was checking out
the Maddie Hayward Web site,

01:24.008 --> 01:27.433
and they accidentally left a link open
to internal political documents.

01:27.434 --> 01:28.601
Okay...

01:28.602 --> 01:30.436
It's an easy thing to do, but I got

01:30.437 --> 01:32.205
a screen grab before they closed it.

01:32.206 --> 01:33.539
Hold on.
That's our call waiting.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.373
Oh, sure. Take your time.
That's why I'm here.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.310
Hello? No.

01:39.061 --> 01:39.811
Okay, hold on.

01:39.812 --> 01:41.713
Uh, Mom, do you know an Elsbeth?

01:41.714 --> 01:43.748
Tascioni? Is that
her on the phone?

01:43.749 --> 01:45.417
Yeah, she wants to talk to you,
but I have Eli

01:45.418 --> 01:47.485
- on the other line.
- Zach, give me the phone.

01:47.486 --> 01:50.319
Sorry, Eli. I have to call you
back on my cell phone.

01:50.790 --> 01:51.856
Elsbeth, hi.

01:51.857 --> 01:52.957
Are you all right?

01:52.958 --> 01:54.092
Uh, yes.

01:54.093 --> 01:55.426
I just need your help on a case.

01:55.427 --> 01:56.660
Okay. What's the case?

01:56.661 --> 01:58.596
It's a contract enforcement arbitration

01:58.597 --> 01:59.797
for my client, Anna.

01:59.798 --> 02:01.365
It should only take a few hours.

02:01.366 --> 02:03.601
We've got it covered, Zach.
Don't worry.

02:03.602 --> 02:05.770
No, Maddie Hayward is going
after race-- racial bias.

02:05.771 --> 02:07.338
There is no racial bias.
Don't worry.

02:07.339 --> 02:08.270
It says right here that they

02:08.271 --> 02:09.439
have two ASAs working under Dad

02:09.440 --> 02:10.506
who will say that he's biased

02:10.507 --> 02:11.774
against them because they're black.

02:11.775 --> 02:13.943
It's a bluff.
They want us to chase our tails.

02:13.944 --> 02:15.278
I don't think so, Eli.

02:15.279 --> 02:17.780
When did you start talking
to me like I was a peer?

02:17.781 --> 02:19.315
Sorry, Mr. Gold.

02:19.316 --> 02:21.951
Okay, send me your screen grab,
and I'll look into it.

02:21.952 --> 02:23.119
Okay, I'm sending it now.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.919
Yeah. Okay.
No, I'm going to come right in.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.021
I'll see you there.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.092
Nice having breakfast with you, too.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.195
That joke was written
for me by my staff,

02:34.196 --> 02:35.897
so they appreciate your laughter.

02:35.898 --> 02:39.200
But, uh, this is no joke.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.101
I love business.

02:41.102 --> 02:44.171
I am not the type of feminist
that hates to make a dollar.

02:44.172 --> 02:46.974
I am a feminist
that wants you to make money.

02:46.975 --> 02:48.309
With women.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.412
And with
African-Americans.

02:51.413 --> 02:53.247
And Latinos and all minorities.

02:53.248 --> 02:55.483
I think racial bias
is an impediment to business.

02:55.484 --> 02:58.351
Where the hell did that come from?

03:00.488 --> 03:02.489
We need to talk about debates.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.090
Okay. We're talking.

03:04.091 --> 03:06.459
- Four debates?
- Better talk to Eli.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.827
Eli says one.

03:07.828 --> 03:09.462
Well, Eli speaks for me.

03:09.463 --> 03:11.030
Nice to see you.

03:11.031 --> 03:13.131
Yes. Say hello to Alicia.

03:15.868 --> 03:17.469
I will.

03:18.305 --> 03:20.071
What'd she say?

03:20.072 --> 03:22.240
The debates.

03:22.241 --> 03:24.743
She wants four.

03:24.744 --> 03:27.145
She may be coming after you about race.

03:27.146 --> 03:28.579
Preferential hiring and promotion

03:28.580 --> 03:29.880
in the State's Attorney's Office?

03:29.881 --> 03:31.282
Uh, let it go.

03:31.283 --> 03:33.818
Race is a scab--
you don't pick at it.

03:34.319 --> 03:36.954
We think she has a couple
of ASAs who are...

03:36.955 --> 03:39.324
- gonna go public.
- Public about what?

03:39.325 --> 03:42.460
- And who's "we"?
- Zach.

03:43.362 --> 03:45.295
He found an open link
on Maddie's Web site

03:45.296 --> 03:47.263
- to some confidential memos.
- Who's Zach?

03:47.264 --> 03:48.865
- Your son.
- Yeah.

03:49.701 --> 03:52.168
So talk to the ASAs.

03:52.169 --> 03:54.204
- See if anyone's disgruntled.
- Just let it go.

03:56.473 --> 03:58.742
Let me think about it.

04:00.510 --> 04:02.712
Hi. Elsbeth Tascioni.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.181
Elsbeth?

04:08.352 --> 04:11.153
Alicia! In here. Hi!

04:11.154 --> 04:12.855
Oh, boy.

04:12.856 --> 04:14.089
<i>I was trying to question</i>

04:14.090 --> 04:16.190
Simon Fassel, the defendant

04:16.192 --> 04:17.492
in this arbitration.

04:17.493 --> 04:19.627
He was giving a Q and A after a speech,

04:19.628 --> 04:20.695
and he had me arrested.

04:20.696 --> 04:23.097
I've never been arrested in my life.

04:23.098 --> 04:24.332
And then I turned around.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.533
This is nice.

04:25.534 --> 04:26.768
What is this?

04:26.769 --> 04:27.836
Tahari, I think.

04:27.837 --> 04:29.838
So you want me to cover
for a case for you.

04:29.839 --> 04:31.205
- Is that it?
- Yes, yes.

04:31.206 --> 04:33.374
This defendant, Fassel,

04:33.375 --> 04:35.676
is the CEO of Erobos,

04:35.677 --> 04:37.011
the running shoe company.

04:37.012 --> 04:38.179
Do you know it?

04:38.180 --> 04:40.348
Well, they reneged on
an endorsement contract

04:40.349 --> 04:42.250
for $5 million with my client,

04:42.251 --> 04:45.584
and the contract enforcement
arbitration is in two hours,

04:45.620 --> 04:47.721
and I won't be out in time.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.489
And what time
is your bond hearing today?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.824
Not until 2:00, so if you
could just cover for me,

04:51.825 --> 04:53.626
that would be great.
Hi, Judy.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.128
Meet Alicia.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.763
Hi.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.198
<i>This is in Skokie?</i>

04:58.199 --> 04:59.732
Yes, on a Friday.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.667
They don't do bond hearings
on the weekend.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.904
Get her a transport to downtown
in the next 20 minutes

05:03.905 --> 05:05.637
or she won't get a hearing
until Monday.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.273
So, I have to ask a favor, Will.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.374
Can you handle

05:08.375 --> 05:09.775
a contract arbitration in an hour?

05:09.776 --> 05:10.842
No, I've got a deposition.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.677
Can someone else there handle it?

05:12.678 --> 05:13.745
It's Elsbeth Tascioni.

05:14.746 --> 05:15.981
It's Elsbeth?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.383
That's the lawyer you're with?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.084
Yes.

05:20.885 --> 05:21.919
Miss Buday?

05:22.220 --> 05:23.087
Hello.

05:23.388 --> 05:25.823
I know you were expecting your
lawyer, Elsbeth Tascioni.

05:25.824 --> 05:27.225
I'm her friend, Will Gardner.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.327
She asked me to take
the arbitration today.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.861
What happened?

05:30.862 --> 05:32.397
She was arrested

05:32.398 --> 05:34.332
for harassing Simon Fassel, the CEO.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.900
Oh, my gosh.
So she's not coming?

05:35.901 --> 05:37.200
Just for today.

05:37.201 --> 05:39.069
I'll ask for a continuance,
but don't worry.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.238
Your endorsement contract is ironclad.

05:41.239 --> 05:42.739
This is just a formality.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.074
Now, you won two silver medals.

05:44.075 --> 05:45.742
They can't argue nonperformance.

05:45.743 --> 05:47.377
If I can't get the continuance,

05:47.378 --> 05:49.612
I'll handle today's evidence
and Elsbeth will take over

05:49.613 --> 05:50.780
on Monday, okay?

05:50.781 --> 05:51.915
You got her arrested?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.983
Don't answer that, Simon.

05:53.984 --> 05:55.717
I'll meet you inside.

05:55.718 --> 05:57.086
Is this your new lawyer?

05:57.087 --> 05:59.088
Temporarily.
I'm Will Gardner.

05:59.089 --> 06:00.222
Morgan Croft.

06:00.623 --> 06:02.491
Sorry to lose Elsbeth as an opponent.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.761
She was very entertaining.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.864
Can you beat them?

06:09.565 --> 06:11.000
Yes.

06:24.746 --> 06:27.881
The Erobos team shot that
commercial last December.

06:27.882 --> 06:29.049
- Is that correct, Anna?
- Yes.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.951
- Were you ever paid for it?
- No.

06:30.952 --> 06:32.219
It was also never shown.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.320
Payment was not dependent

06:33.321 --> 06:35.055
- on distribution, was it, Anna?
- No.

06:35.056 --> 06:36.656
Sir, very simply,

06:36.657 --> 06:39.360
Erobos owes my client $5 million,

06:39.361 --> 06:41.995
and we understand
they've overextended themselves

06:41.996 --> 06:43.029
with endorsement contracts,

06:43.030 --> 06:44.297
but there's no reason my client...

06:44.298 --> 06:45.431
Actually, sir, the company

06:45.432 --> 06:47.066
has always reserved the right to void

06:47.067 --> 06:48.834
- any endorsement contract.
- Yes, with cause.

06:48.835 --> 06:50.669
- Erobos has shown no such cause.
- That's true, sir.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.372
We haven't-- until now.

06:52.373 --> 06:53.639
The contract may be voided

06:53.640 --> 06:56.442
if the athlete is banned
from a race due to doping.

06:56.443 --> 06:56.916
What?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.810
Ann Buday has been banned from
Monday's world team trials.

06:58.811 --> 07:01.346
- I have not.
- I have here an AADL release

07:01.347 --> 07:03.048
of their findings last night.

07:03.049 --> 07:05.149
Anna has been accused
of using dexitetrasolone

07:05.150 --> 07:06.218
and has been banned from Monday's...

07:06.219 --> 07:07.919
I have never doped.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.922
My parents would kill me
before they'd let me dope.

07:09.923 --> 07:11.724
The AADL disagrees,

07:11.725 --> 07:13.224
and if Anna misses her race on Monday

07:13.225 --> 07:14.659
due to this ban,

07:14.660 --> 07:16.728
her contract is voided.

07:18.663 --> 07:20.896
You need to get me Elsbeth.

07:22.599 --> 07:24.235
This was all a setup.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.469
- No.
- Yes.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.539
I can't get a bond hearing
until Monday,

07:27.540 --> 07:30.123
and Anna has to appeal
the AADL decision

07:30.124 --> 07:32.125
this weekend in order to run on Monday.

07:32.126 --> 07:33.493
They knew this was gonna happen.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.427
Well, Will is gonna take

07:34.428 --> 07:35.962
- the appeal...
- I like Will.

07:36.963 --> 07:37.931
I-I do, too.

07:37.932 --> 07:39.132
How is he?

07:39.133 --> 07:40.400
Good. He's good.

07:40.401 --> 07:42.368
I was sad when he was suspended.

07:42.369 --> 07:43.536
I was, too.

07:43.537 --> 07:45.805
He's gonna take the appeal
to the, um...

07:45.806 --> 07:49.041
CAS--
Court of Arbitration for Sports.

07:49.042 --> 07:51.577
Tell Will that the CAS

07:51.578 --> 07:53.479
doesn't run
like an American court, okay?

07:53.480 --> 07:56.148
It has a whole set of rules
based on Swiss law.

07:56.149 --> 07:58.684
Okay, and I'm gonna work on
getting you transported downtown

07:58.685 --> 07:59.952
for a weekend bond hearing.

07:59.953 --> 08:01.420
Good, and I'll do what?

08:01.421 --> 08:02.421
You're gonna sit tight.

08:02.422 --> 08:03.689
We're on it.

08:12.422 --> 08:17.689
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

08:20.137 --> 08:21.804
You know what the lesson is here?

08:21.905 --> 08:23.506
Don't get arrested in the suburbs.

08:23.507 --> 08:25.808
Not on a Thursday night.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.944
Unfortunately, we need
a little relief now, Your Honor.

08:28.945 --> 08:30.479
I can't help you on the arrest.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.646
Oh, no, it's not that.

08:31.647 --> 08:33.347
We just need to get
my client transferred

08:33.349 --> 08:35.450
so we can get a bail hearing
here on the weekend.

08:35.451 --> 08:37.251
Otherwise she's stuck
in the suburbs till Monday.

08:37.253 --> 08:38.553
Skokie won't transfer her?

08:38.554 --> 08:40.288
She missed the last transport.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.758
Please, Your Honor?

08:44.759 --> 08:46.293
How's Peter doing?

08:46.294 --> 08:48.729
Good. Well.

08:49.230 --> 08:51.765
I bet you that bitch
is nipping at his heels, huh?

08:52.366 --> 08:54.168
Yes.

08:54.169 --> 08:55.636
Hey, John.

08:55.937 --> 08:57.405
It's Tommy, upriver.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.939
How you doing?

08:58.940 --> 09:01.142
Listen, you've got an arrestee
there by the name of...

09:01.143 --> 09:03.009
Elsbeth Tascioni.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.711
...Elsbeth Tascioni?

09:06.992 --> 09:08.081
Yeah, listen, uh,

09:08.082 --> 09:10.616
get another transport
to drag her ass up here, okay?

09:11.117 --> 09:12.552
Yeah, it's nothing big.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.389
What?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.657
No, no, no, no, okay.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.159
You do what you got to do.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.460
All right.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.628
Thank you. Bye.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.533
Is your client erratic?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.834
My... Why?

09:29.835 --> 09:32.171
He says this Elsbeth has, uh,

09:32.172 --> 09:33.338
been demonstrating
some erratic behavior,

09:33.339 --> 09:34.972
and they have to do a psych evaluation

09:34.973 --> 09:36.640
before they can transport her.

09:36.641 --> 09:38.309
Liability.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.411
Well, I can trump a lot of things,

09:40.412 --> 09:42.547
but I can't trump insurance issues,

09:42.548 --> 09:45.881
so you tell your client
to pass her psych eval

09:46.118 --> 09:47.985
and I'll get her up here.

09:47.986 --> 09:49.920
We think we can get
Elsbeth out in a few hours,

09:49.921 --> 09:51.254
but I'll have to take this for now.

09:51.255 --> 09:52.589
They're going to do the hearing here?

09:52.590 --> 09:54.057
It's the only place
the arbitrators could find

09:54.058 --> 09:56.560
on such short notice.

10:00.331 --> 10:03.100
It's a three-judge panel
like any other appeals hearing.

10:03.101 --> 10:05.168
We'll be fine.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.935
<i>Le Tribunal Aribtral du Sport</i>
<i>est en session.</i>

10:06.936 --> 10:09.572
<i>Je m'appelle Antoine Villapique.</i>

10:09.573 --> 10:11.340
<i>Je serai le président du comité.</i>

10:11.341 --> 10:13.542
<i>Il y aura trois membres du comité,</i>

10:13.543 --> 10:15.677
<i>à moins qu'il n'y a pas d'objection.</i>

10:15.678 --> 10:16.878

10:16.879 --> 10:18.114
<i>Je n'ai aucune objection.</i>

10:18.115 --> 10:19.181
<i>Et bienvenue à nouveau</i>

10:20.484 --> 10:21.717
<i>Merci.</i>

10:21.718 --> 10:23.618
<i>Ca me fait plaisir de te revoir.</i>

10:23.619 --> 10:24.986
What the hell? It's in French?

10:24.987 --> 10:26.787
I don't know.
This is my first.

10:26.788 --> 10:28.223
<i>A ma droite, Alberto Ciccone d'Italie.</i>

10:28.224 --> 10:29.457
<i>Et à ma gauche,</i>

10:29.458 --> 10:31.292
<i>Karl Heinrich de l'Allemagne...</i>

10:31.293 --> 10:33.128
- Excuse me, Your Honor.
- Yes?

10:33.129 --> 10:35.396
I apologize for interrupting.

10:36.397 --> 10:38.032
I don't speak French.

10:38.033 --> 10:40.300
You... don't?

10:40.301 --> 10:42.469
No, I'm sorry. This is...

10:42.470 --> 10:44.070
all new to me.

10:44.071 --> 10:47.274
<i>Je n'ai aucun problème conduite</i>
<i>de ces procédures en anglais.</i>

10:47.275 --> 10:49.075
<i>- Monsieur Plunkett?</i>
<i>- Bien sûr.</i>

10:49.076 --> 10:51.778
<i>Une autre victime de notre</i>
<i>système éducatif américain.</i>

10:53.681 --> 10:56.516
Mr. Plunkett from
the American Anti-Doping League

10:56.517 --> 10:59.850
has agreed to let us conduct
this panel entirely in English

11:00.020 --> 11:02.588
for your benefit, Mr....

11:02.589 --> 11:04.223
Gardner, Will Gardner,

11:04.224 --> 11:07.160
from good old U.S. of A.

11:07.161 --> 11:08.594
Good to know.

11:08.595 --> 11:10.062
(Speaks French)

11:10.063 --> 11:11.596
Good, so we're set to begin.

11:11.597 --> 11:14.599
Please proceed, Mr. Gardner.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.733
- Excuse me?
- Please proceed.

11:18.871 --> 11:20.004
With?

11:20.005 --> 11:21.239
Your defense.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.775
What is the charge?

11:23.776 --> 11:25.177
There is no charge.

11:25.178 --> 11:27.911
Miss Anna Buday has been banned
from Monday's race

11:27.912 --> 11:29.680
due to her use of boosters,

11:29.681 --> 11:31.248
dexitetrasolone.

11:31.249 --> 11:32.849
If you have no defense,

11:32.850 --> 11:34.768
there is no reason for a hearing.

11:34.769 --> 11:36.570
Yes, but Anna has passed
every drug test,

11:36.571 --> 11:39.106
including the one last week
for Monday's race, Your Honor.

11:39.107 --> 11:40.241
Technically, she did

11:40.242 --> 11:41.975
pass her drug test,
monsieur le président,

11:41.976 --> 11:43.810
but afterward,
the tester found ghosting.

11:43.811 --> 11:46.846
Her B-sample had the
same marker ratios

11:46.847 --> 11:48.748
as the Notorious Six.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.583
Notorious six?

11:50.584 --> 11:52.552
Six runners banned from Monday's
race for using boosters,

11:52.553 --> 11:53.719
designer drugs.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.156
In fact, the tester found
a surge of ICSH,

11:56.157 --> 11:57.490
interstitial cell stimulator,

11:57.491 --> 11:59.191
the fingerprint for booster use.

11:59.192 --> 12:02.525
(Panel conversing in French)

12:03.964 --> 12:06.265
Uh, I-I need...

12:08.234 --> 12:09.468
I'm sorry. Excuse me, all right?

12:09.469 --> 12:10.836
Objection.

12:10.837 --> 12:12.137
There's no objection here,
Mr. Gardner.

12:12.138 --> 12:13.372
This is not <i>Law & Order.</i>

12:15.107 --> 12:16.540
Yeah. Thank you.

12:16.541 --> 12:18.876
How do I express my displeasure

12:18.877 --> 12:20.011
with something that has transpired,

12:20.012 --> 12:22.280
<i>- monsieur le...</i>
- You may speak it to me.

12:22.281 --> 12:24.248
Well, given that we've established

12:24.249 --> 12:27.551
I flunked out of French, uh,
it seems unfair to conduct

12:27.552 --> 12:29.620
in a colloquy in a language
unknown to the defendant.

12:29.621 --> 12:31.554
- Appellant.
<i>- Merci, monsieur.</i>

12:31.555 --> 12:33.123
Your point is
well-taken, Mr. Gardner.

12:33.124 --> 12:34.157
And Mr. Plunkett

12:34.158 --> 12:35.959
referred to a witness

12:35.960 --> 12:41.293
who saw a courier carry drugs
to Anna Buday at the Olympics.

12:41.332 --> 12:43.266
Here is the affidavit.

12:43.267 --> 12:45.268
Well, then we call
this witness to the stand--

12:45.269 --> 12:48.602
- Chenise Jayes.
- There is no stand, Mr. Gardner.

12:48.972 --> 12:51.107
Well, to the chair
in the middle of the room.

12:51.108 --> 12:53.809
(Panel conversing in French)

12:53.810 --> 12:55.544
Excuse me, Your Honors...

12:55.545 --> 12:57.779
Uh, I mean, uh, uh,
messieurs, uh, le présidents...

12:57.780 --> 13:00.082
We are debating whether
to grant you your request

13:00.083 --> 13:01.917
- to question your witness.
- Grant my request?

13:01.918 --> 13:03.218
No.

13:03.219 --> 13:04.419
<i>Oui.</i>

13:05.220 --> 13:07.489
By a two to one margin,

13:07.990 --> 13:08.923
we grant your request.

13:08.924 --> 13:12.027
We shall suspend this panel
until we contact the witness.

13:13.195 --> 13:14.862
I'm gonna need to get some help here.

13:14.863 --> 13:16.498
I'll be right back.

13:30.845 --> 13:34.178
Will, how'd the deposition go?

13:36.249 --> 13:36.749
What?

13:36.750 --> 13:39.519
Yes, how's your French?

13:40.454 --> 13:43.022
<i>"Elle était fort déshabillée</i>

13:43.023 --> 13:45.491
<i>"Et de grands arbres indiscrets</i>

13:45.492 --> 13:47.726
<i>"Aux vitres jetaient leur</i>

13:47.727 --> 13:49.295
<i>"feuillée</i>

13:49.296 --> 13:51.296
<i>Malinement, tout près,</i>
<i>tout près."</i>

13:51.297 --> 13:53.031
Good.
I need you at a sports hearing.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.632
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.601
Thank you. I have
a massage in two hours.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.036
Diane, I need your help.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.370
This CAS panel-- that's the
Court of Arbitration for Sport--

14:01.874 --> 14:03.508
they're talking in French.

14:05.343 --> 14:07.378
- What is this again?
- It's something for a friend.

14:07.379 --> 14:08.845
I need your help, Diane.

14:08.846 --> 14:10.981
Will, it's the weekend.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.550
Another time.

14:12.951 --> 14:14.751
It's Elsbeth Tascioni.

14:18.389 --> 14:19.823
Where?

14:19.824 --> 14:20.991
You are one of the most brilliant

14:20.992 --> 14:22.059
lawyers I have ever met.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.493
Aw. Really?

14:23.494 --> 14:25.195
But that's not going to help you.

14:25.196 --> 14:28.064
You need to pass your psych eval.

14:28.765 --> 14:30.833
Okay. How?

14:31.334 --> 14:33.903
They're gonna ask you 120 questions,

14:33.904 --> 14:36.672
and they are going to
pause for a long time

14:36.673 --> 14:40.006
between each question to
encourage you to talk.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.211
And I'm not supposed to talk?

14:42.212 --> 14:45.545
No, you are, but just not as much

14:46.182 --> 14:47.282
as you normally would.

14:47.283 --> 14:49.218
- Do I talk too much?
- No. I just think

14:49.219 --> 14:51.420
it's best to be... circumspect.

14:53.255 --> 14:54.255
Okay.

14:54.256 --> 14:55.856
So they'll ask you questions like,

14:55.857 --> 14:58.192
"Do you resent
being given advice?"

14:58.193 --> 15:00.193
Oh, well, what advice?

15:00.194 --> 15:02.862
Just... any advice.

15:02.863 --> 15:04.631
Okay. But...

15:04.632 --> 15:06.533
Of course not.
I like getting advice.

15:06.534 --> 15:08.868
Is that bad? Does that
make me seem noncommittal?

15:08.869 --> 15:10.203
No. That's fine.

15:10.204 --> 15:12.205
Just don't worry about it afterward.

15:12.206 --> 15:14.274
- Like I just did?
- Right.

15:14.275 --> 15:16.408
Okay. Give me another one.

15:16.409 --> 15:18.744
Um... um...

15:18.745 --> 15:20.679
do you like to stay active,

15:20.680 --> 15:22.348
and are you bored really easily?

15:22.349 --> 15:23.715
No.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.817
I mean...

15:26.318 --> 15:27.753
I like to stay active,

15:27.754 --> 15:30.589
but I don't really get bored.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.941
That's a tough one, because
it's a compound question.

15:33.942 --> 15:35.976
But I guess that's the point.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.779
Huh.

15:37.780 --> 15:40.347
They want my mind to chase
down the two tracks.

15:40.348 --> 15:43.681
Yes, that's why they ask them that way.

15:43.752 --> 15:46.421
So, it is best just to...

15:46.422 --> 15:49.055
let the silence rest.

15:49.056 --> 15:50.957
Okay?

15:50.958 --> 15:52.459
Okay?

15:52.460 --> 15:54.428
Oh.

15:54.429 --> 15:55.695
Good. Exactly.

15:55.696 --> 15:59.029
Good. Very good.

16:02.301 --> 16:04.302
Thanks for doing this, Geneva.

16:04.303 --> 16:06.337
For doing what?

16:06.338 --> 16:08.505
Talking with me, helping me.

16:08.506 --> 16:10.007
Can I get you anything?

16:10.008 --> 16:11.475
Water? Soda?

16:11.476 --> 16:13.644
No. Thanks.

16:16.447 --> 16:18.649
So, how am I doing?

16:18.650 --> 16:20.183
How are you doing?

16:20.184 --> 16:22.452
Yeah, you know, promotions, reductions,

16:22.453 --> 16:25.287
fostering limited funds,
managing the office.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.724
That kind of thing.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.425
Fine.

16:29.426 --> 16:31.761
Uh-huh. Good.

16:31.762 --> 16:34.097
And do you find any, uh,

16:34.098 --> 16:37.166
bias in how I'm handling things?

16:37.167 --> 16:39.200
Well, I know. I know.

16:39.201 --> 16:40.636
You're in my office,

16:40.637 --> 16:43.105
and I'm asking you whether
I'm doing a good job.

16:43.106 --> 16:46.174
It puts you in a very
uncomfortable position, I know.

16:46.175 --> 16:47.876
But let me just say this.

16:47.877 --> 16:49.344
I need to self-evaluate.

16:49.345 --> 16:51.446
There will be no repercussions

16:51.447 --> 16:54.449
one way or another--
none-- so...

16:54.950 --> 16:57.783
how am I doing on racial bias?

17:00.389 --> 17:02.790
You're asking about racial bias
in the office?

17:02.791 --> 17:04.425
Yes.

17:04.425 --> 17:06.327
And you want me to speak honestly?

17:06.328 --> 17:09.263
- Yes, and with no repercussions.
- You're racially biased.

17:11.799 --> 17:13.433
I am?

17:14.184 --> 17:15.569
Well, what do you mean by that?

17:15.569 --> 17:18.672
You have fired
five African-Americans

17:18.673 --> 17:20.773
and promoted two Caucasians.

17:20.775 --> 17:21.941
That's racially biased.

17:21.942 --> 17:24.109
Well, that's strictly coincidence.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.079
You're right.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.347
- Thank you.
- Oh, wait.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.681
Wait. Geneva,
I'm sorry.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.354
Let's start over.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.089
Tell me.

17:40.026 --> 17:43.359
Cary Agos was not ready
to be promoted to deputy.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.431
Matan Brody was.
I was.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.766
Together, we had two decades
more experience,

17:48.767 --> 17:50.302
but you promoted Cary

17:50.303 --> 17:52.304
because you liked him.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.706
You fired Wendy Scott-Carr.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.441
- You demoted Dana Lodge.
- Wait a minute.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.642
There might have been reasons.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.276
There are always reasons.

17:59.277 --> 18:01.712
But you didn't listen
to their reasons for staying.

18:01.713 --> 18:04.615
It's about who you listen to.

18:04.616 --> 18:06.817
That's the key.

18:07.819 --> 18:09.986
Well, let's say that you're right.

18:09.987 --> 18:11.522
What should I do?

18:11.523 --> 18:13.257
Rethink.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.225
Review all promotions.

18:15.226 --> 18:18.060
Return hiring to a pure meritocracy.

18:18.061 --> 18:20.930
And you rejected the request
to speak at the Minority Rights

18:20.931 --> 18:22.232
Coalition last week?

18:22.233 --> 18:24.166
It was considered a slap in the face.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.168
So the Minority Rights
Coalition is offended?

18:26.169 --> 18:28.170
Yes.

18:28.171 --> 18:30.005
Your opponent is going.

18:31.406 --> 18:32.874
I would talk to them.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.976
You're a good talker.

18:34.977 --> 18:36.545
Talk to them.

18:37.846 --> 18:39.281
<i>Chenise Jayes.</i>

18:39.282 --> 18:42.615
I'm an anchor on the 400-meter
U.S. relay team,

18:42.852 --> 18:43.768
and Anna's roommate.

18:43.769 --> 18:45.070
This isn't
necessary, Mr. Gardner.

18:45.071 --> 18:46.071
We know who she is.

18:46.072 --> 18:47.771
Of course.
Thank you, Your...

18:47.772 --> 18:50.674
Uh, <i>monsieur...</i>
<i>le président.</i>

18:50.675 --> 18:52.643
So, you claimed
you saw a man giving my client,

18:52.644 --> 18:53.844
Anna Buday, drugs.

18:53.845 --> 18:55.179
Could you describe what you saw?

18:55.180 --> 18:57.848
Yeah. It was the night
before we left for London,

18:57.849 --> 19:00.485
and this Asian guy
in a Cubs cap shows up

19:00.486 --> 19:02.053
around 2:00 in the morning.

19:02.054 --> 19:04.854
And he was talking
all hush-hush,

19:04.855 --> 19:06.523
and handed her a bottle of pills,

19:06.524 --> 19:08.325
and then Anna went into the bathroom.

19:08.326 --> 19:09.592
Did you see the pills?

19:09.593 --> 19:10.994
Uh-uh, I was over on the couch.

19:10.995 --> 19:12.862
Oh, couldn't they have been
vitamins or aspirin?

19:12.863 --> 19:14.964
We had all that stuff in our room.

19:14.965 --> 19:16.933
So you didn't know this guy?
You'd never seen him before?

19:16.934 --> 19:19.136
I didn't know him at the time,
but now I do.

19:19.137 --> 19:20.336
- You do?
- Yeah.

19:20.337 --> 19:21.738
It was Nelson Kimora,

19:21.739 --> 19:23.606
one of the Notorious Six.

19:23.607 --> 19:26.843
(Panel conversing in French)

19:30.748 --> 19:32.448
Excuse me.

19:32.449 --> 19:33.650
Yes.

19:33.651 --> 19:34.851
We are not stumbling our
way through anything.

19:34.852 --> 19:37.586
And we ask that you show
our defense its due respect.

19:37.987 --> 19:39.187
My apologies, madam.

19:39.188 --> 19:40.756
We have come here

19:40.757 --> 19:43.291
not to be prejudged, and we ask nothing

19:43.292 --> 19:46.194
other than you listen
to us with an open mind.

19:46.195 --> 19:47.596
Uh, what is the quote?

19:47.597 --> 19:49.898
<i>"Ceux qui sont libérés</i>
<i>de préjugés ordinaires</i>

19:49.899 --> 19:51.732
<i>peuvent acquérir</i>
<i>les autres."</i>

19:51.733 --> 19:54.168
Prejudices have no place here.

19:54.169 --> 19:56.103
Yes, you are right.

19:56.104 --> 19:57.204
My personal apology.

19:57.205 --> 19:58.472
- Ask for something.
- Like what?

19:58.473 --> 19:59.607
I don't know.
Something.

19:59.608 --> 20:01.576
Uh, and, uh, we ask the panel

20:01.577 --> 20:03.945
for a brief recess until tomorrow.

20:03.946 --> 20:06.346
We are looking
at an <i>arrière-pensée</i>

20:06.347 --> 20:08.048
- for this persecution.
- I believe

20:08.049 --> 20:09.950
the defendant has already been
allowed an extended break.

20:09.951 --> 20:12.052
- Appellant.
- I believe this panel

20:12.053 --> 20:14.688
can allow the appellants time
to prepare

20:14.689 --> 20:16.623
for their... <i>attaque au fer.</i>

20:17.124 --> 20:18.592
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

20:19.593 --> 20:20.627
<i>Okay, all those years</i>

20:20.628 --> 20:23.229
I disparaged French
as a pointless class--

20:23.230 --> 20:25.130
I take them back.
Nice job.

20:25.131 --> 20:29.864
Anna, who is this guy
who visited you-- Nelson Kimora?

20:29.903 --> 20:31.303
Someone on the team, a sprinter.

20:31.304 --> 20:32.838
- Did he bring you these drugs?
- No.

20:32.839 --> 20:34.807
Did he bring you anything?

20:34.808 --> 20:37.643
But he meant something to you.
I mean, who is he?

20:38.712 --> 20:41.146
My boyfriend...
before the Olympics.

20:41.147 --> 20:42.614
We're not together now.

20:42.615 --> 20:44.549
So he was your boyfriend,
but he didn't bring you drugs?

20:44.550 --> 20:45.783
That's correct.

20:45.784 --> 20:47.219
Anna, if you don't tell us the truth,

20:47.220 --> 20:49.521
- we can't help you.
- I am telling the truth.

20:49.522 --> 20:50.888
There were no drugs.

20:50.889 --> 20:52.424
Nothing happened.

20:53.925 --> 20:55.227
<i>And you don't believe her?</i>

20:55.228 --> 20:57.161
She's, uh, hiding something.

20:57.162 --> 20:58.329
We don't know what.

20:58.330 --> 20:59.796
Maybe just her boyfriend's drug use.

20:59.797 --> 21:01.499
Or maybe she's hiding
the drugs for him.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.666
Well, I don't know,

21:02.667 --> 21:05.068
but we can't defend her
unless she tells us.

21:05.069 --> 21:06.403
Could you check with Elsbeth?

21:06.404 --> 21:08.071
She knows Anna more

21:08.072 --> 21:09.507
than we do.

21:09.508 --> 21:12.042
I already did, but she's in
a psych evaluation right now.

21:12.043 --> 21:14.343
Well, when she's done,
would you ask her again?

21:14.344 --> 21:15.778
We need some help with Anna here.

21:15.779 --> 21:17.146
We only have one more day left.

21:17.147 --> 21:18.247
Okay.

21:18.248 --> 21:20.215
I will, and, Diane,
thanks for doing this.

21:20.216 --> 21:22.752
Hey, it's just the weekend.

21:22.753 --> 21:25.455
Do you feel guilty about drinking

21:25.456 --> 21:27.857
or using chemicals?

21:27.858 --> 21:30.559
I don't feel guilty about drinking,

21:30.810 --> 21:32.911
which I <i>do</i> do...

21:32.912 --> 21:34.679
<i>Do</i> do?

21:34.680 --> 21:37.582
But I don't use chemicals,

21:37.583 --> 21:40.485
which, I imagine you
mean chemical stimulants,

21:40.486 --> 21:43.819
so it would be impossible
to feel guilty about that.

21:50.679 --> 21:53.614
Why did you laugh,
Ms. Tascioni?

21:53.615 --> 21:55.516
No reason.

21:55.517 --> 21:58.152
Just... your pause
seemed funny.

21:58.153 --> 21:59.453
Why?

21:59.454 --> 22:01.689
- No reason.
- Well, there must be some reason.

22:01.690 --> 22:05.023
No. Just the oddity
of human behavior.

22:05.927 --> 22:07.561
What do you mean, the oddity?

22:07.562 --> 22:09.396
What do I mean?

22:09.397 --> 22:11.565
The...

22:13.568 --> 22:15.802
Yes, Ms. Tascioni?

22:15.803 --> 22:17.470
She was pregnant.

22:17.521 --> 22:19.456
Excuse me?

22:19.457 --> 22:22.191
ICSH is the male equivalent of LH.

22:22.192 --> 22:24.927
Luteinizing hormone,
a pregnancy-related hormone.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.012
Ms. Tascioni...

22:26.013 --> 22:27.096
That's why the unexplained
hormonal surge.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.897
It wasn't drug use.
She was pregnant.

22:28.898 --> 22:30.099
Do you mind?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.300
But that was ten months
ago-- the Olympics.

22:31.301 --> 22:33.569
- She doesn't have...
- I know. I know. Wait.

22:34.404 --> 22:36.038
The pills her boyfriend brought her.

22:36.039 --> 22:37.440
What if it wasn't boosters?

22:37.441 --> 22:38.773
What if it was mifepristone?

22:38.774 --> 22:40.508
And that's why
she doesn't want to tell us.

22:40.509 --> 22:43.011
You have to go talk to her, tell
her she has to tell the truth.

22:43.012 --> 22:45.380
Okay.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.323
What was the question again?

22:56.324 --> 22:58.225
You have to tell them.

22:58.226 --> 23:01.095
That I had an abortion?

23:01.596 --> 23:03.063
No.

23:03.064 --> 23:05.099
No, I can't.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.834
Anna, you didn't dope.

23:07.835 --> 23:10.103
You terminated a pregnancy.

23:10.104 --> 23:12.105
You need to tell them.

23:12.106 --> 23:13.506
I can't.

23:13.507 --> 23:15.341
Your family?

23:15.842 --> 23:17.510
My parents, my-my sister.

23:17.511 --> 23:18.944
They'll understand.

23:19.445 --> 23:21.114
It's worse that you were doping.

23:21.115 --> 23:23.149
No.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.118
It's not worse.

23:25.119 --> 23:28.020
Not to my family, not to me.

23:30.423 --> 23:33.525
I wanted to medal.

23:33.526 --> 23:36.061
I was pregnant, and I wanted to medal.

23:39.899 --> 23:42.233
Here's the problem, Anna.

23:42.234 --> 23:45.567
We can defend you with the truth.

23:46.238 --> 23:47.638
If you tell the truth,

23:47.639 --> 23:50.374
you will get your $5 million contract,

23:50.375 --> 23:52.043
and you will run on Monday.

23:52.044 --> 23:55.179
If you don't, you will lose both.

23:56.981 --> 23:59.516
Then I'll lose both.

24:01.552 --> 24:04.885
I can't break their hearts
in this, Will.

24:06.657 --> 24:08.658
So what do we do?

24:10.243 --> 24:11.928
You need to help me win this.

24:11.929 --> 24:13.796
With a lie?

24:14.547 --> 24:17.130
If that's what it takes.

24:27.142 --> 24:30.310
Hi. Um, how's it going?

24:31.411 --> 24:34.147
No, no, no, no, no, no, I...
I was just checking in.

24:34.148 --> 24:35.882
Oh, thanks.

24:35.883 --> 24:37.349
So, what are you doing?

24:37.350 --> 24:40.319
Trying to get a lawyer out
of lockup. What about you?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.989
I'm, uh, watching Eli and Jordan

24:42.990 --> 24:44.823
argue over whether I should go

24:44.824 --> 24:46.758
to the Minority Rights Coalition today.

24:46.759 --> 24:48.660
What did you say you were doing?

24:48.661 --> 24:51.263
A lawyer friend of mine
got arrested in Skokie,

24:51.264 --> 24:53.765
and she missed the transport
to her bail hearing.

24:53.766 --> 24:54.833
That's not good.

24:54.834 --> 24:56.268
Why don't you have the presiding judge

24:56.269 --> 24:57.335
transport her downtown?

24:57.336 --> 24:58.369
I tried that.

24:58.370 --> 25:00.371
The lawyer failed her psych eval.

25:00.372 --> 25:02.206
Mmm. Liability.

25:02.207 --> 25:04.408
You want me to make a call?

25:05.610 --> 25:07.644
Could you?

25:07.645 --> 25:09.479
Yeah. What's the lawyer's name?

25:09.480 --> 25:11.115
You know her. Elsbeth Tascioni.

25:11.116 --> 25:12.116
Ah.

25:12.117 --> 25:13.417
What?

25:13.418 --> 25:15.519
She was the lawyer on my retrial.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.586
It's gonna look

25:16.587 --> 25:18.454
- like a political favor.
- Not a personal one.

25:18.455 --> 25:20.690
Right. Um...

25:20.691 --> 25:21.791
look, let me think about it.

25:21.792 --> 25:22.792
No, no.

25:22.793 --> 25:24.660
Peter, that is not why I called.

25:24.661 --> 25:26.696
Why did you call?

25:26.697 --> 25:30.030
Uh... I was just checking in.

25:30.201 --> 25:32.068
Oh. Then why don't you...

25:32.069 --> 25:34.069
come visit me at the campaign bus?

25:34.070 --> 25:36.805
We're at Morgan Park, and then
maybe we'll get a bite to eat.

25:36.806 --> 25:38.740
If I get a break, I will.

25:38.741 --> 25:41.443
Good. And one thing you might
try with Elsbeth--

25:41.444 --> 25:43.312
question the arrest itself.

25:43.313 --> 25:44.779
Make it a constitutional issue,

25:44.780 --> 25:46.281
and that way, the presiding judge

25:46.282 --> 25:48.016
will have to transport her.

25:48.017 --> 25:49.283
Good. Thanks.

25:49.284 --> 25:50.584
All right. See you.

25:50.585 --> 25:52.519
<i>Thank you for answering</i>

25:52.520 --> 25:53.721
our questions, Mr. Chesterfield.

25:53.722 --> 25:55.990
<i>- Dr.</i> Chesterfield.
- Ah.

25:55.991 --> 25:57.158
<i>C'est ma faute.</i>

25:57.159 --> 25:58.860
I'm sorry. I don't speak French.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.961
Ah.

25:59.962 --> 26:02.596
My mistake.
So, you are the chemist

26:02.597 --> 26:04.265
who tested Anna
Buday's B-sample?

26:04.266 --> 26:06.333
I'm lead analyst at Edgar Labs.

26:06.334 --> 26:08.501
We test and interpret samples
for all U.S. athletes.

26:08.502 --> 26:09.569
So that's a yes?

26:10.070 --> 26:12.272
- Yes.
- And you are familiar with

26:12.273 --> 26:14.241
the booster scandal, <i>docteur?</i>

26:14.242 --> 26:15.641
Yes, I'm the one who discovered it.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.845
- And the new compound, dexitetrasolone.
- Uh-huh.

26:18.846 --> 26:21.580
And after you discovered it,
did you test this... substance?

26:21.981 --> 26:23.749
No.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.218
We're still waiting on
subpoenas of private labs

26:26.219 --> 26:28.120
- in China who manufacture it.
- I see, so...

26:28.121 --> 26:30.155
you have never seen
this mysterious substance.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.991
You have never held it,
never tested it.

26:31.992 --> 26:33.259
So how can you be
positive it even exists?

26:33.260 --> 26:34.526
I don't need

26:34.527 --> 26:37.028
the actual drug to know
that it's real, ma'am.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.130
Think of contrails
from an airplane--

26:39.131 --> 26:40.664
they don't just appear;

26:40.665 --> 26:41.832
Something had to make them.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.667
So how do you prove definitely

26:43.668 --> 26:45.403
that Anna used this compound

26:45.404 --> 26:46.771
when she denies it?

26:46.772 --> 26:48.072
Does she have contrails?

26:48.073 --> 26:49.540
If we are to argue

26:49.541 --> 26:51.809
in metaphors, gentlemen,
then contrails are enough.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.277
They were enough with Lance Armstrong.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.245
I'm sorry.
Is it your turn to argue?

26:55.246 --> 26:56.513
This isn't about arguments.

26:56.514 --> 26:57.915
These Chicago lawyers continue to think

26:57.916 --> 26:59.349
that this is an adversarial proceeding.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.551
Oh, our mistake. I guess
we should all just agree

27:01.552 --> 27:02.853
Anna is guilty.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.154
This is not an American
court, Mr. Gardner.

27:04.155 --> 27:06.056
There's no need to be
at each other's throat.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.391
Uh, this is not <i>Rambo.</i>

27:07.392 --> 27:10.059
<i>Les règles d'LAAD</i>

27:10.060 --> 27:11.827
<i>n'exigent pas la preuve définitif.</i>

27:11.828 --> 27:14.663
The rules don't require actual proof

27:14.664 --> 27:16.665
to keep her from running on Monday.

27:16.666 --> 27:18.734
We have to find another way.

27:19.602 --> 27:20.569
Hi.

27:20.570 --> 27:21.971
- Hi.
- What do you need?

27:21.972 --> 27:24.706
Will and Diane are running
into a dead end at the CAS

27:24.707 --> 27:27.375
and have asked me
to review your trial notes.

27:28.376 --> 27:29.077
These.

27:29.078 --> 27:31.579
- Diane? Diane's on it, too?
- Yeah.

27:31.580 --> 27:33.114
She's so elegant.

27:33.950 --> 27:36.418
Yeah. Um...

27:36.419 --> 27:37.552
what does that say?

27:37.553 --> 27:39.854
That's background
on Dr. Chesterfield.

27:39.855 --> 27:42.022
- What happened with him?
- Contrails.

27:42.023 --> 27:43.257
Yeah.

27:43.258 --> 27:44.959
He loves his contrails.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.294
The problem with doping charges
is the burden of proof

27:47.295 --> 27:50.628
is reversed-- you have
to prove you're innocent.

27:51.131 --> 27:53.167
- What?
- Where's Alicia?

27:53.168 --> 27:55.035
She's trying to get you
a trial downtown,

27:55.036 --> 27:57.203
but what is it you were about to say?

27:57.204 --> 27:59.205
- Me?
- Yeah.

27:59.206 --> 28:01.540
Oh, yes.
Tell Will and Diane

28:01.541 --> 28:03.576
they have to attack the three pillars.

28:03.577 --> 28:05.578
- The three...
- Pillars.

28:05.579 --> 28:06.946
It's the way they substantiate

28:06.947 --> 28:10.280
doping charges--
Pillar one: Analysis.

28:10.317 --> 28:12.251
I guess we lost on that one.

28:12.252 --> 28:14.619
- What are the other two?
- Uh, I-I don't know.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.654
- No, I'm asking myself.
- Oh.

28:16.655 --> 28:18.756
Co... confidentiality.

28:18.757 --> 28:21.360
And, uh...
chain of custody.

28:21.361 --> 28:24.062
- Chain of custody?
- Yes. Like a three-legged stool,

28:24.063 --> 28:26.698
you knock that out, the CAS falls over.

28:26.699 --> 28:29.300
Okay. Thanks.

28:29.301 --> 28:31.668
- You know what?
- What?

28:31.669 --> 28:33.637
I hate depending on other people.

28:33.638 --> 28:35.272
Me, too.

28:35.273 --> 28:37.007
Look, I'll be back.

28:37.008 --> 28:40.076
Oh, looks like your transport
downtown has arrived.

28:41.378 --> 28:43.213
Yay!

28:43.214 --> 28:44.847
<i>Now, we all know</i>

28:44.848 --> 28:47.717
<i>that I have made mistakes,</i>
<i>but I want to learn.</i>

28:47.718 --> 28:49.986
That's why I'm here speaking to you,

28:49.987 --> 28:52.321
- the Minority Rights Coalition.
- Three debates?

28:52.322 --> 28:54.723
You do the voters a disservice
if you give them anything less.

28:54.724 --> 28:56.958
Oh, yes, that's what this is all about,

28:56.959 --> 28:58.293
doing the voters a service.

28:58.294 --> 28:59.828
- We'll consider three.
- We will not. Two.

28:59.829 --> 29:01.263
You give us two town halls,

29:01.264 --> 29:03.598
- we will consider three.
- This is not an official negotiation.

29:03.599 --> 29:04.599
Why not, Eli?

29:04.600 --> 29:05.700
- What's wrong with three?
- Maddie,

29:05.701 --> 29:07.302
send your representatives over to me...

29:07.303 --> 29:08.737
I do things myself.

29:08.738 --> 29:10.772
Write my own speeches,
spend my own money.

29:10.773 --> 29:12.607
Why don't we just shake
right now on three?

29:12.608 --> 29:14.275
No. Not right now.

29:15.611 --> 29:17.445
My office...

29:17.446 --> 29:19.714
prosecutes more
African-Americans

29:19.715 --> 29:21.716
than any other group,

29:21.717 --> 29:23.317
and I want to know why.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.989
<i>President Obama...</i>

29:28.990 --> 29:32.323
<i>promised a discussion</i>
<i>on race in this country.</i>

29:33.929 --> 29:35.629
<i>We've never had it.</i>

29:35.630 --> 29:38.799
I'm not the type that likes
to point fingers, Eli, but...

29:38.800 --> 29:40.767
you should listen to me more.

29:40.768 --> 29:42.702
I know what I'm doing.

29:47.608 --> 29:49.375
No, court's
at 9:00 tomorrow.

29:49.376 --> 29:51.277
I should have her out by noon.

29:51.278 --> 29:52.478
Okay, got to go.

29:52.979 --> 29:55.812
- Did... you have a break?
- Yeah.

29:56.283 --> 29:59.517
- You all right?
- Yeah. It was a...

29:59.518 --> 30:01.720
just a bad speech.

30:02.855 --> 30:04.690
You have time for a bite?

30:06.392 --> 30:08.860
Sure.

30:15.801 --> 30:19.134
♪ Non, rien de rien ♪

30:20.806 --> 30:24.139
♪ Non, je ne regrette rien... ♪

30:26.979 --> 30:28.345
Come on, Peter.

30:28.346 --> 30:31.214
It's not as bad as you think.

30:31.215 --> 30:33.449
Come on! Peter, let's talk!

30:33.450 --> 30:35.085
I need a minute!

30:35.953 --> 30:37.854
Just a minute?

30:37.855 --> 30:39.856
A campaign minute.

30:39.857 --> 30:43.190
♪ Ca commence avec toi. ♪

30:51.635 --> 30:53.268
Okay.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.470
I've got to get going.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.474
- What?
- Nothing.

30:59.975 --> 31:01.809
So, uh...

31:01.810 --> 31:04.612
do I have to ask how we're doing?

31:04.613 --> 31:06.413
No.

31:06.414 --> 31:08.215
Okay.

31:08.216 --> 31:10.051
So we're just...

31:10.552 --> 31:11.653
where we are.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.755
Do you want us to be somewhere else?

31:13.756 --> 31:15.356
Oh, no, no, just...

31:15.357 --> 31:16.624
just checking.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.358
Okay.

31:18.359 --> 31:20.260
I'll talk to you later.

31:20.261 --> 31:22.095
You want some water?

31:22.930 --> 31:24.665
Sure.

31:28.936 --> 31:30.904
Oh. Don't worry.

31:30.905 --> 31:33.105
Just the wife.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.382
That is not true, Your Honor.

31:48.383 --> 31:49.716
This is a constitutional matter.

31:49.717 --> 31:51.085
No, it is a stupid matter.

31:51.086 --> 31:52.253
Would one of you take a break

31:52.254 --> 31:54.254
from your scrimmage
and please fill me in?

31:54.255 --> 31:56.856
Ms. Tascioni was arrested
for harassing Mr. Fassel,

31:56.857 --> 31:58.791
CEO of Erobos Sports and a defendant...

31:58.792 --> 32:00.726
He was speaking at Braddock University

32:00.727 --> 32:02.160
- and invited questions.
- Yes, which would've

32:02.161 --> 32:04.296
been fine, except she followed
him out to his car.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.865
What is the constitutional matter here?

32:05.866 --> 32:07.366
The campus police who arrested

32:07.367 --> 32:09.868
Ms. Tascioni did so
illegally by leaving

32:09.869 --> 32:12.136
- their area of jurisdiction.
- That's why we're here on a Sunday?

32:12.137 --> 32:13.371
As you can see
from this map, Your Honor,

32:13.372 --> 32:15.673
the campus police
arrested Ms. Tascioni

32:15.674 --> 32:17.341
beside Mr. Fassel's car

32:17.342 --> 32:18.843
here in Parking Garage C.

32:18.844 --> 32:20.545
Which is a part
of the university grounds.

32:20.546 --> 32:21.979
No, it is aDJacent to the university,

32:21.980 --> 32:25.313
but it is owned by the Illinois
Trust & Loan Bank here.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.418
Fassel's lawyer.

32:27.419 --> 32:29.085
Okay. Your Honor,

32:29.086 --> 32:31.889
if we're sinking to this level
of ludicrousity...

32:31.890 --> 32:33.657
- "Ludicrousity"?
- Braddock University

32:33.658 --> 32:35.959
leases the garage from Illinois Trust,

32:35.960 --> 32:36.993
and is thus entrusted

32:36.994 --> 32:37.961
to patrol it.

32:37.962 --> 32:39.095
Not the second and third floor.

32:39.096 --> 32:40.163
How do you know that?

32:40.164 --> 32:41.364
I don't know how I know

32:41.365 --> 32:42.398
half the things I know.

32:42.399 --> 32:43.499
Mrs. Florrick?

32:43.500 --> 32:44.634
Yes, Your Honor.

32:44.635 --> 32:46.502
The university does not lease

32:46.503 --> 32:47.570
the second and third floors.

32:47.571 --> 32:49.472
It only leases the...

32:49.473 --> 32:50.573
First and the fourth.

32:50.574 --> 32:51.808
...the first
and the fourth floors.

32:51.809 --> 32:52.975
The second and third floors

32:52.976 --> 32:54.744
are for bank customer parking only.

32:54.745 --> 32:57.512
Ms. Tascioni was arrested on...

32:57.513 --> 32:58.547
The third floor stairwell.

32:58.548 --> 33:01.616
...in the third floor stairwell.

33:04.954 --> 33:07.589
Okay, here's how we're doing things.

33:07.590 --> 33:10.659
The four of you get all of your
whispering out of the way.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.461
Go and discuss everything
you want to discuss

33:13.462 --> 33:14.394
outside the court.

33:14.395 --> 33:15.963
Come back in here in 20 minutes

33:15.964 --> 33:17.631
with your best arguments.

33:17.632 --> 33:18.666
And Ms. Pine?

33:18.667 --> 33:20.100
I have to say this.

33:20.101 --> 33:21.969
I'm inclined to toss this arrest,

33:21.970 --> 33:25.303
'cause I, too, think it's stupid.

33:25.373 --> 33:28.476
So, Anna Buday gave a urine sample

33:28.477 --> 33:31.310
on the 20th of July 2012
at 7:00 a.m.?

33:31.311 --> 33:32.846
Yes, that's what my intake form states.

33:32.847 --> 33:34.046
Good.

33:34.047 --> 33:35.448
And that was the sample

33:35.449 --> 33:37.350
that led you to conclude that Anna had

33:37.351 --> 33:39.118
a contrail, <i>oui?</i>

33:39.119 --> 33:40.820
Well, that she had a burst of ICSH.

33:40.821 --> 33:42.522
Similar to the Notorious Six.

33:42.523 --> 33:44.123
Ah. No more metaphors.

33:44.124 --> 33:45.291
Good.

33:45.292 --> 33:47.559
And when did the technician

33:47.560 --> 33:49.394
give the sample to your designated

33:49.395 --> 33:50.529
- shipping company?
- I don't know.

33:50.530 --> 33:51.530
Well, hopefully

33:51.531 --> 33:52.865
this will refresh your memory.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.967
It is a receipt
for the shipping of the sample.

33:54.968 --> 33:57.870
Can you see the time
and the date there?

33:57.871 --> 33:59.204
Would you read it?

33:59.205 --> 34:01.072
July 21, 5:18 p.m.

34:01.073 --> 34:05.806
Rule 44G, subpart M of
the AADL code states,

34:05.844 --> 34:07.244
"All samples shall be shipped

34:07.245 --> 34:09.547
"via approved courier on the same day

34:09.547 --> 34:10.681
that they are
collected."

34:10.681 --> 34:11.916
I am aware of the code.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.217
"Any unexplained delay in shipping

34:13.217 --> 34:14.385
"will constitute a break

34:14.386 --> 34:16.053
"in the chain of custody,

34:16.054 --> 34:17.621
and the test must be discarded."

34:17.621 --> 34:20.255
Occasionally, a technician
is unable to mail the sample

34:20.257 --> 34:23.359
on the same day, usually because
the courier is closed.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.261
There's no violation
as long as the sample

34:25.262 --> 34:26.429
remains in our facility.

34:26.429 --> 34:27.931
You're right.
That is why we,

34:27.931 --> 34:29.699
um...

34:32.703 --> 34:35.538
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

34:36.339 --> 34:37.940
That is why we checked the log

34:37.940 --> 34:39.474
at your testing facility.

34:39.475 --> 34:41.744
It was closed.

34:41.745 --> 34:43.612
It could not have remained
in your facility.

34:43.612 --> 34:44.947
It must have remained
with this technician.

34:44.947 --> 34:46.214
Objection.

34:46.215 --> 34:47.616
This is a respect
of form over substance.

34:47.617 --> 34:49.284
I thought there were no objections.

34:49.284 --> 34:50.585
There is no scientific way

34:50.585 --> 34:51.886
the delay in delivering the sample

34:51.887 --> 34:53.888
- could create a false positive.
- One moment, please.

34:53.889 --> 34:57.222
(Speaking French)

34:57.392 --> 35:00.662
Judge Villapique says the sample
should still be allowed.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.197
- Why?
- The delay was a technicality.

35:03.198 --> 35:06.531
The Italian judge is for us.

35:07.234 --> 35:08.669
The German is

35:08.670 --> 35:10.336
against us, but not as strongly.

35:10.337 --> 35:13.373
(Speaking French)

35:13.374 --> 35:16.642
Villapique says this is what
comes from these Rambo tactics.

35:16.643 --> 35:18.010
What is it with him and Rambo?

35:18.011 --> 35:19.379
Does anybody even watch <i>Rambo</i> anymore?

35:19.380 --> 35:20.947
(Speaking French)

35:20.948 --> 35:24.050
He is suggesting a 30-minute
recess to discuss this further.

35:24.051 --> 35:25.685
We need to flip the German.

35:25.686 --> 35:26.686
Where's Tascioni?

35:27.687 --> 35:29.321
Here we are again.

35:29.822 --> 35:31.256
With your argument
this time, Ms. Pine.

35:31.257 --> 35:34.590
While the State continues
to maintain the campus police's

35:34.961 --> 35:38.130
jurisdiction included
the parking garage-- all levels

35:38.131 --> 35:40.031
of said garage--
their arrest

35:40.032 --> 35:42.701
on the third floor also qualifies

35:42.702 --> 35:44.602
for the hot pursuit exemption.

35:44.603 --> 35:46.404
Your Honor, please, if I may borrow

35:46.405 --> 35:47.771
the ASA's word
"ludicrousity..."

35:47.772 --> 35:48.806
You may not.

35:48.807 --> 35:49.907
I'm banning that word.

35:49.908 --> 35:52.410
Um...

35:52.911 --> 35:53.644
Mrs. Florrick...

35:54.145 --> 35:55.346
The hot pursuit doctrine

35:55.347 --> 35:57.582
applies only in emergency situations

35:57.583 --> 35:59.182
when the officer doesn't have time

35:59.183 --> 36:00.450
to alert another jurisdiction.

36:00.451 --> 36:01.884
Neither of these elements existed here.

36:01.885 --> 36:03.052
The defendant

36:03.053 --> 36:05.088
threatened a guest lecturer
at the university.

36:05.089 --> 36:07.657
He fled, she followed him,
verbally assaulting the victim

36:07.658 --> 36:09.659
while he was trying to get to his car.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.894
Okay, okay.
Thank you, everyone.

36:11.895 --> 36:14.131
I think we're gonna
make history here today,

36:14.132 --> 36:16.732
spending more time on less.

36:16.733 --> 36:19.001
And yet, I have come to my decision.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.504
Afterward, you can all appeal
to the Supreme Court.

36:21.505 --> 36:22.938
He's gonna rule against us.

36:22.939 --> 36:24.240
It was a legal arrest.

36:24.241 --> 36:25.674
The campus police--

36:25.675 --> 36:29.008
loath as I am to give them
any kind of a win--

36:29.346 --> 36:31.980
did step out of their
jurisdiction, but with cause.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.148
And on that note...

36:33.149 --> 36:35.017
Your Honor, we request
that you allow Ms. Tascioni

36:35.018 --> 36:36.451
to be taken to bond court

36:36.452 --> 36:37.686
currently in session down the hall.

36:37.687 --> 36:38.787
No, Your Honor.

36:38.788 --> 36:41.222
Respectfully, this court
lacks the authority

36:41.223 --> 36:43.391
to overrule a Skokie
psychologist's determination

36:43.392 --> 36:44.993
on her mental state.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.328
Your Honor, it was in Skokie
that they determined

36:47.329 --> 36:49.797
that my client was too risky
for transport, yet here she is.

36:49.798 --> 36:51.165
If you rule against her,

36:51.166 --> 36:52.366
they will take her back to Skokie

36:52.367 --> 36:54.268
and then drive her
back here again on Monday.

36:54.269 --> 36:55.970
This is bureaucratic insanity.

36:55.971 --> 36:57.437
And yet, it's the law.

36:57.438 --> 37:00.675
What is even more insane
is this emergency hearing,

37:00.676 --> 37:01.742
which was just deployed

37:01.743 --> 37:03.510
to get the defendant here
in the first place.

37:03.511 --> 37:06.313
Your Honor, all we are asking
is that you allow my client

37:06.314 --> 37:07.265
to walk down the hall.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.215
We request that
Ms. Florrick be sanctioned.

37:08.216 --> 37:09.516
Oh, my God.

37:09.517 --> 37:11.117
Stop it. Seriously, stop.

37:11.118 --> 37:14.451
Please, go find some criminals
to prosecute and defend.

37:14.789 --> 37:18.058
Jim, please escort the
defendant down to bond court

37:18.059 --> 37:19.493
so she can post bail.

37:19.494 --> 37:21.360
- Your Honor, that is not...
- Come on, Ms. Pine.

37:21.361 --> 37:24.129
When the law is an ass,
someone has to kick it.

37:24.130 --> 37:26.799
You can do all your crying

37:26.800 --> 37:28.334
and hugging down the hall.

37:28.335 --> 37:29.569
Get her out of here.

37:39.679 --> 37:41.680
Thank you all
for the fervor and passion

37:41.681 --> 37:43.649
you brought to our proceedings.

37:43.650 --> 37:45.184
It has been quite dramatic.

37:45.185 --> 37:48.520
We have considered
your arguments, pro and con,

37:48.521 --> 37:50.087
and we have decided against

37:50.588 --> 37:52.256
your chain of custody concern.

37:52.257 --> 37:53.991
You've decided?
It's in your own rule book.

37:53.992 --> 37:55.726
You can't just decide.

37:55.727 --> 37:58.996
Yes, it's in our discretion
to apply the guidelines

37:58.997 --> 38:02.330
as we see fit, depending
on the unique set of facts.

38:02.334 --> 38:03.567
The ruling stands.

38:03.568 --> 38:04.668
So, they're guidelines now?

38:04.669 --> 38:07.270
(Speaking French)

38:07.271 --> 38:08.771
ELSBET I'm coming!

38:08.772 --> 38:09.772
Hi!

38:09.773 --> 38:10.840
I'm here!

38:10.841 --> 38:12.208
I'm here.

38:12.209 --> 38:13.376
Hello?

38:13.377 --> 38:15.045
I'm coming.

38:15.046 --> 38:16.179
Sorry.

38:16.180 --> 38:17.113
I was delayed.

38:17.114 --> 38:18.548
Uh, <i>pardonnez-moi,</i>
<i>messieurs.</i>

38:18.549 --> 38:20.383
<i>Puissionsnous confèrent un instant?</i>

38:20.384 --> 38:21.851
We are ready, Your Honor.

38:21.852 --> 38:23.252
We have a new lawyer joining us.

38:23.253 --> 38:26.586
Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow. Okay.

38:26.589 --> 38:28.023
Sorry.

38:28.024 --> 38:31.357
<i>Je tiens à appeler un</i>
<i>autre témoin, messieurs.</i>

38:31.627 --> 38:33.762
We're conducting this
in English, Elsbeth.

38:33.763 --> 38:35.497
Ah, well, Yes.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.599
Will! Hey.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.035
Oh, thank you.

38:41.036 --> 38:44.369
And Diane.

38:44.540 --> 38:46.574
- ...what an elegant dress.
- Thank you.

38:46.575 --> 38:49.477
Uh, I've just been really moved by

38:49.478 --> 38:50.445
you guys doing this...

38:50.446 --> 38:52.013
Excuse me.

38:52.714 --> 38:54.614
We have a hearing.

38:54.615 --> 38:56.816
Ah, yes.

38:59.988 --> 39:03.023
Hi. I'm Elsbeth Tascioni,

39:03.024 --> 39:06.093
and I am late
because I was under arrest.

39:06.094 --> 39:09.363
Dedrick Klein.

39:09.364 --> 39:11.797
Mr. Klein, the cyclist?

39:11.798 --> 39:13.232
Why is he here?

39:13.233 --> 39:15.301
To speak regarding
the CAS rule application.

39:15.302 --> 39:17.936
I don't think we need this witness.

39:17.937 --> 39:20.072
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

39:20.073 --> 39:22.608
<i>Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous</i>
<i>entendre Klein?</i>

39:22.609 --> 39:25.244
(Conversation continues in French)

39:26.778 --> 39:28.046
Uh, uh, uh, gentlemen?

39:28.047 --> 39:29.847
Gentlemen, please, please.

39:29.848 --> 39:31.282
We ask for a consensus.

39:31.283 --> 39:33.851
Par un vote à main levée.

39:36.955 --> 39:39.257
Judge Villapique,

39:39.258 --> 39:41.159
you're outvoted two to one.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.593
Thanks for coming,
Mr. Klein.

39:43.594 --> 39:44.594
Welcome.

39:44.595 --> 39:46.497
Two years ago, you were accused

39:46.498 --> 39:49.831
of using banned substances
and suspended from cycling.

39:50.001 --> 39:52.301
Did you appeal like Anna?

39:52.402 --> 39:53.037
Yes.

39:53.038 --> 39:54.538
My arbitration was in Lausanne.

39:54.539 --> 39:57.841
- And can you tell us what happened?
- Yes.

39:57.842 --> 39:59.008
There was no evidence,

39:59.009 --> 40:01.977
but the panel confirmed
my guilt, two to one.

40:02.478 --> 40:05.311
Judge Villapique convinced
the Egyptian judges,

40:05.382 --> 40:06.582
- which is wrong.
- Excuse me.

40:06.583 --> 40:07.616
This is not relevant.

40:07.617 --> 40:09.385
So, Judge Villapique was on your panel?

40:09.386 --> 40:11.054
- Yes.
- I think Mr. Plunkett

40:11.055 --> 40:12.288
makes a very good observation.

40:12.289 --> 40:14.122
The relevance has not been established.

40:14.123 --> 40:15.190
Uh, you were the one?

40:15.191 --> 40:16.824
The witness is excused.

40:16.825 --> 40:18.527
You pushed our cyclist out?

40:18.528 --> 40:19.994
Mr. Klein's arbitration
was confidential.

40:19.995 --> 40:21.763
Except if the athlete

40:21.764 --> 40:24.999
chose to waive confidentiality,
which Mr. Klein just did.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.201
She's correct.

40:26.202 --> 40:27.902
Mr. Klein, who
convinced the Egyptian judge

40:27.903 --> 40:28.903
to vote against you?

40:28.904 --> 40:30.737
Judge Villapique.

40:30.738 --> 40:32.206
And when you were
stripped of your title,

40:32.207 --> 40:34.641
who was the runner-up?
Xavier Lanier.

40:34.642 --> 40:36.743
Xavier Lanier, who is French?

40:36.744 --> 40:38.712
- Yes.
- This has nothing to do with it.

40:38.713 --> 40:40.448
I'm appalled by the insinuation.

40:40.449 --> 40:42.049
Antoine, you should
have recused yourself.

40:42.050 --> 40:44.051
He cheated.
He didn't deserve that medal.

40:44.052 --> 40:46.252
(Speaking French)

40:50.157 --> 40:52.492
(Panel arguing in French)

40:57.831 --> 41:00.266
I just realized...

41:00.267 --> 41:02.068
you're Rambo.

41:03.136 --> 41:05.137
<i>President Obama</i>

41:05.638 --> 41:08.971
promised a discussion
on race in this country.

41:09.542 --> 41:11.276
Well, now, why would I
want to hear that?

41:11.277 --> 41:13.579
Because it went viral.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.046
Because people are calling you brave,

41:15.047 --> 41:16.248
standing up to special interests.

41:16.249 --> 41:17.316
Let's wait till the polls

41:17.317 --> 41:18.316
come out tomorrow.

41:18.317 --> 41:19.550
Yeah, let's wait.

41:19.551 --> 41:21.885
The polls will prove
what the editorials are saying.

41:21.886 --> 41:23.687
This is your Sister Souljah moment.

41:23.688 --> 41:26.056
You spoke truth to minority interests,

41:26.057 --> 41:27.558
so when those two ASAs go public,

41:27.559 --> 41:28.726
they'll be seen as sour grapes.

41:28.727 --> 41:29.893
You inoculated yourself.

41:29.894 --> 41:30.861
Yeah, that's some win.

41:30.862 --> 41:32.696
Winning by pissing off minorities.

41:32.697 --> 41:34.564
Here's a thing that some people
just never learn.

41:34.565 --> 41:36.466
We are not teaching
a fifth-grade ethics class.

41:36.467 --> 41:37.667
We're here to win.

41:37.668 --> 41:39.802
Win pretty, win ugly--
it's still winning.

41:46.977 --> 41:48.144
Go easier on him, Eli.

41:48.145 --> 41:49.311
Why?

41:49.312 --> 41:50.780
Because we need him.

41:51.781 --> 41:52.381
Why?

41:53.382 --> 41:55.251
Do you want to get into this now?

41:55.252 --> 41:56.484
I want to know why we need him.

41:56.485 --> 41:57.819
Are you being investigated?

42:01.190 --> 42:03.391
Then you know why.

42:08.163 --> 42:10.532
To my friends.

42:10.533 --> 42:13.367
Thank you for getting me
out of the suburbs.

42:13.368 --> 42:14.169
No need to thank us.

42:14.170 --> 42:16.037
Especially once you see the bill.

42:18.605 --> 42:20.340
Eli.

42:20.341 --> 42:21.975
What are you doing?

42:21.976 --> 42:24.010
Nothing.

42:24.511 --> 42:26.412
Okay.

42:26.413 --> 42:28.148
What are you doing?

42:28.149 --> 42:30.783
You know I'm being investigated?

42:30.784 --> 42:32.485
Yes.

42:33.236 --> 42:36.538
And you know I'm being
edged out of the campaign?

42:36.789 --> 42:38.224
No, I didn't know that.

42:38.225 --> 42:39.992
And you guys can't represent me

42:39.993 --> 42:41.093
because you're being investigated.

42:41.094 --> 42:43.729
Yes, I had heard that.

42:44.230 --> 42:47.563
I need a lawyer to represent me.

42:50.069 --> 42:51.769
Ms. Tascioni?

42:52.405 --> 42:54.005
Got a minute?

42:54.306 --> 42:55.707
Sure.
