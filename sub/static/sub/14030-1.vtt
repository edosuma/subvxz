01:19.000 --> 01:21.434
Excuse me, hi.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.714
You dropped your keys.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.136
They were back there
on the ground?

01:24.160 --> 01:25.200
Yeah, just
right over there

01:25.680 --> 01:27.910
I'm a klutz. I'm so sorry.
Thank you so much.

01:28.000 --> 01:28.876
Holly.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.836
Charlie.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.194
Charlie Mac?

01:31.880 --> 01:33.074
The photographer?

01:33.160 --> 01:36.835
No way! I follow you on
Instagram and Tumblr. Really?

01:36.920 --> 01:38.239
I'm not a stalker, though.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.799
No, no.
I know a lot of stalkers.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.120
You don't look
like one of them.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.471
Your photos,
they're amazing.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.120
Thank you,
it's really just a hobby.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.110
I'm an agent.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.031
Listen, I hope you don't mind
me saying this,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.076
but you look
way better in person.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.392
So, my pictures suck?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.272
No! I...
I'm joking, I'm joking.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.952
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.393
So, hypothetically
speaking...

01:58.480 --> 01:59.754
Uh-huh.
Right.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.035
Say I might know somebody...
Okay.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.395
Who might want to do a
photo shoot with you.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.948
You might know somebody that
might want to do a pho...

02:07.040 --> 02:09.554
Well, this whole hypothetical situation,
let's see...

02:09.639 --> 02:10.868
[inhales]

02:10.960 --> 02:13.474
They would have
to stop by my studio,

02:13.680 --> 02:15.318
and then,
go on from there.

02:15.720 --> 02:23.720
♫

02:42.120 --> 02:43.997
Give me some more
of your high energy.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.433
Just stay
having fun with it.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.949
[camera shutter clicking]

03:06.920 --> 03:09.150
[]breathing heavily]

03:13.800 --> 03:15.518
That was amazing.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Great shoot.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.158
(Rick)
Hey, check this out.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.151
"Hashtag
Throwback Thursday."

03:30.240 --> 03:32.276
Uh-huh. Aw!
Aw, that's cute!

03:32.360 --> 03:33.873
Who would've thought
this little boy

03:33.960 --> 03:36.030
would turn out to be
a porn director?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.473
[all laughing]

03:37.560 --> 03:38.959
Wait, you're a
porn director?

03:39.040 --> 03:40.519
No, I'm not
a porn director.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.636
I just did it one time
to pay for school.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.473
Mmm!
Leave Rick alone.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.993
Where was that at?

03:46.120 --> 03:47.936
That was in front of Charlie's
grandmother's house, right?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.536
Yeah, that was the day Charlie and
Sherry moved into the neighborhood.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.232
I can't believe that
was 20 years ago.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.231
Uh-huh.
What was 20 years ago?

03:54.320 --> 03:56.231
Here he is! You were 20 years ago.
What up, man?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.470
Charlie Mac is in the house.
What's good?

03:58.560 --> 04:00.073
My dawg, what up?
You good?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.559
Hey, guys,
this is Fawn.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.232
Uh, Fawn,
this is everyone.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.216
Hey, you know what, Fawn?
I'm gonna move like this...

04:05.240 --> 04:07.117
Oh.
Hi, Fawn.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.590
Well, Charlie and Fawn,
this is Dana.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.398
Charlie, uh,
Dana is my friend

04:12.520 --> 04:13.640
that I was
telling you about.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.837
The one that I invited here tonight,
so you could meet her.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.391
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.590
So, it's "Fawn",
like a baby deer?

04:23.680 --> 04:26.558
No, like "Dawn",
but with an "F."

04:26.640 --> 04:28.471
(Victor) We are so glad
you could join us.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.834
So glad.
Speak for yourself.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.736
Have we made a decision?
Perfect timing, um...

04:31.760 --> 04:33.830
Let's get everybody a round.
Okay.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.837
And I'll take a Manhattan.
All right.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.391
How's the wedding planning going?
Great. New subject.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.596
Okay.
How's life at the agency?

04:41.680 --> 04:42.874
Oh, we're
kicking ass, man.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.269
Things are going great.
Tavaysha is killing it.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.793
Uh, I just signed
Fawn, here.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.233
She's a big Vine star.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.799
Say what?
That's a thing?

04:49.880 --> 04:52.348
Duh. It's like,
YouTube star.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.070
Okay, um, well now
that everyone is here,

04:56.160 --> 04:57.878
I would like
to ask a question.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.434
Here we go.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.399
And as I always say, you don't have
to answer if you don't want to.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.993
Well, before you
ask your question,

05:05.080 --> 05:06.354
let me ask you
a question.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.796
Did you ask NetNews if we're gonna
get paid for all these surveys?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.760
You work for NetNews?
(Ginger) Mmm-hmm.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.149
I have literally always
wanted to be on there.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.320
Oh, well, Ginger's a relationship
columnist for them,

05:16.360 --> 05:17.360
so here's your chance.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.874
Uh, Ginger, you got
some questions to ask?

05:19.960 --> 05:21.712
Um, okay, um...

05:22.480 --> 05:25.119
What is your deal breaker
in a relationship?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.349
(Rick)
Oh, that's simple.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.480
I couldn't be with anyone
who doesn't want a family.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.256
Well, I couldn't be with anyone
who doesn't give head.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.713
[all laughing]

05:32.800 --> 05:34.000
Baby, I'm talking
about family,

05:34.080 --> 05:35.672
and you talking
about giving head?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.416
Oh, I'm not talking
about giving it, honey.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.456
I'm talking
about getting it.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.754
[all laughing]

05:39.840 --> 05:41.671
Okay, okay. Stop.
Dana, what would yours be?

05:41.760 --> 05:44.957
I would say,
my deal breaker would be...

05:45.040 --> 05:47.679
I don't know, I feel like relationships
are so up and down,

05:47.760 --> 05:50.911
that if two people really love
each other and communicate,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.194
there would be
no deal breaker

05:53.360 --> 05:54.588
(Ginger)
I like that a lot.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.749
Chuck,
it's your turn.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.990
Uh, I don't do relationships,

05:59.080 --> 06:00.877
so I don't really have
a deal breaker.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.154
Oh, does Fawn know that?

06:02.240 --> 06:06.597
Oh, I couldn't be with anyone who,
like, doesn't work out.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.033
No offense.
You're talking to me?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.872
(Ginger)
I don't understand you.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.349
I don't get it. I don't get why
you don't do relationships.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.576
Come on,
are we doing this now?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.637
Maybe that's our cue.
I think I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.869
I'm just, uh, gonna go take
some pics out front.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.155
You take some pics.
You send me some pics.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.958
You Snapchat me.

06:26.880 --> 06:27.710
Why do you do it?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.028
Do what?

06:29.480 --> 06:31.311
Bring these little
dinky girls around.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.709
I mean, you've been doing it
since high school, okay?

06:33.800 --> 06:35.153
You're about to be
30 years old.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.816
It's time to grow up.
Doesn't it get old?

06:36.840 --> 06:38.671
Nope, it stays
right around 20.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.799
Whack.
It's not whack.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.718
You know what?
All I know is that you are not bringing

06:43.840 --> 06:45.416
one of these little floozies
to my wedding.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.560
You're right,
I'll bring two floozies to your wedding.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.119
Hey, Victor,
can I have a plus two?

06:49.200 --> 06:49.916
You don't...

06:50.000 --> 06:52.719
[laughs] That is not funny,
Chucky.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.677
[all]
Oh!

06:54.760 --> 06:55.829
You know I hate that name.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.069
Gloves off now.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.176
(Charlie)
You don't want to take it there?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.040
You're lucky I didn't
call you something worse.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.918
And if you keep it up, you're
gonna end up with a plus zero.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.718
(Ginger)
Thank you!

07:04.800 --> 07:06.216
(Ginger) Why would you
even bring her,

07:06.240 --> 07:08.117
if I told you that
I was gonna bring Dana?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.428
I'm not trying
to date Dana.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.438
Why not?
Because she's your friend.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.589
And you guys
know my rules.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.033
[all groaning]

07:15.160 --> 07:17.515
You and these fuckin' rules.
Come on.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.397
We gotta do
the rules again?

07:19.480 --> 07:20.959
All right,
don't touch my camera,

07:21.040 --> 07:22.234
don't wear heels
in my house,

07:22.320 --> 07:23.656
and don't be a friend
of my friend,

07:23.680 --> 07:24.680
'cause I won't
date you.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.273
That don't make
no damn sense.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.588
It makes perfect sense.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.477
You guys know
how I am with women.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.232
As soon as
I have sex with them,

07:31.320 --> 07:35.871
it's like all of my interest
magically disappears.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.791
And I don't know
what to do after that.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.474
So, uh, you know,
if you hook her up with me,

07:40.560 --> 07:41.959
she's gonna end up
hating you,

07:42.040 --> 07:43.856
it'll destroy your friendship,
and I don't want that.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.154
Hmm.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.231
You know what?
Actually, that is probably

07:47.360 --> 07:50.079
the most mature thing
you've said in a long time.

07:50.160 --> 07:50.797
You have a point.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.080
Plus, I thought
she'd be fugly,

07:52.120 --> 07:53.280
like the rest
of your friends.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.276
Oh, man,
you were doing so good!

07:55.360 --> 07:56.588
Most of her friends
are ugly!

07:56.680 --> 07:58.352
[all arguing]

08:02.760 --> 08:05.513
Nate the Animal!
What up, Charlie? My man.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.176
The usual, please, sir.
Let me get a Greek Goddess with cayenne...

08:08.200 --> 08:09.600
And dark chocolate.
Coming right up.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.280
Wait, hold on, Nate. I'll have Sunny
D with a shot of love, please.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.316
Of course you will.
Thank you.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.913
Charlie,
I'm starting to think

08:16.000 --> 08:17.513
that us meeting
at this juice truck

08:17.640 --> 08:19.576
is your way of avoiding
deep conversation with me.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.750
I kinda feel
a bit hurt.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.990
Hi, sister.
Hi, baby.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.997
You never
call me anymore.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.195
I texted you
yesterday.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.874
That's so impersonal.
That doesn't count.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.951
The sound
of a human voice,

08:33.039 --> 08:34.640
it does things
to our soul, to our heart.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.720
Okay.
Okay?

08:35.760 --> 08:36.953
By the way...

08:37.039 --> 08:38.917
I'm going to Mom and Dad's
grave on Sunday,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.115
and I think
you should come.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.238
I'll try.
You need to start dealing

08:42.320 --> 08:43.548
with your issues, Charlie.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.074
I think that's why you have
so many walls up.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.354
You know,
your heart is frozen

08:47.440 --> 08:49.112
because of your
emotional immaturity

08:49.200 --> 08:50.440
and your unwillingness
to accept

08:50.520 --> 08:53.398
that you are deeply
scared of love.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.311
Charlie!

08:57.920 --> 09:00.309
Hey, you.
Uh...

09:00.400 --> 09:01.400
Hi.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.199
Tammi.
Tammi. Tammi, looking good.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.759
You look fantastic.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.353
Then, why have you
been avoiding me?

09:10.440 --> 09:11.509
I'm not avoiding you.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.352
I texted you,
I called you...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.590
Tammi.
Let me stop you, right there.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.829
It's...
It's Tammi, right?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.393
No, don't put
the wall up.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.708
Come back,
come back.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.994
Look at me.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.030
I'm guessing
you've got daddy issues.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.079
That's why you seek approval
in these shallow relationships

09:30.160 --> 09:31.388
I'm not that shallow.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.074
That only leaves you
feeling depressed.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.435
Do you go to sleep
every night crying?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.715
Bottle of whiskey
by your bedside, huh?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.995
Watching re-runs
of Friends,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.150
feeling cheap
and unwanted?

09:43.760 --> 09:44.875
I've been there.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.111
Hey, I helped
Miley Cyrus.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.599
I can help you, too.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.440
Who is she?

09:51.640 --> 09:54.632
I've never met...
I'm his sister, and I'm a therapist.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.396
And baby,
I think you need a hug,

09:57.480 --> 09:58.913
and my card, okay?

10:00.160 --> 10:02.276
Look,
I do pro bono work, I just...

10:02.360 --> 10:03.720
You might not be
able to afford me,

10:03.760 --> 10:05.656
'cause you know,
I've upped my prices recently...

10:05.680 --> 10:07.033
Thank you.
But l...

10:07.440 --> 10:09.954
I'm gonna call you.
You do that now.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.595
I'm gonna call you.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.558
Listen, I'll be the mom
you never had.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.592
Your daddy loves you.
Are you...

10:16.680 --> 10:18.079
Is she flirting
with me right now?

10:18.160 --> 10:20.958
You men always think
you don't need therapy.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.075
It's hilarious.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.952
You know,
I have this client,

10:25.040 --> 10:27.759
wrote this whole song about how
he's not worried about anything.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.991
Turns out, that's all
he talks about in therapy.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.355
How he's worried about this,
worried about that.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.000
Got a girl, and maybe she doesn't
think his penis is big enough.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.991
He's worried about that.
And you know what?

10:38.080 --> 10:40.799
Comes in every single session
with a monkey,

10:40.880 --> 10:43.474
clutching it,
like it's his baby blanket.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.152
You treat French Montana?
What?

10:45.240 --> 10:46.832
Rapper, monkey...
No!

10:46.920 --> 10:48.148
Ain't Worried
About Nothin'?

10:48.240 --> 10:50.629
How did you get French
Montana from that?

10:50.720 --> 10:51.516
Because he has
a monkey.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.192
No, that is not
who I'm talking about.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.096
He has a big record called,
Ain't Worried About...

10:55.120 --> 10:57.776
No, it's not French Montana. Do you
know how many people have pet monkeys?

10:57.800 --> 11:00.075
A lot of people
have them, yeah.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.678
[man]
Morning, Charlie.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.069
Nick.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
Good to see you.
Good morning, Terri. Hi.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.719
Hi, Tiffany.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.799
Good morning, Kareem.
Good morning.

11:09.880 --> 11:10.915
Is Dallas
in my office?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.319
No, Dallas
is in Texas.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.517
Really?
No, really, actually he is.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.397
He sent his protege
Timothy DeLaGhetto.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.880
He's inside waiting for you.
Got it.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.388
Roll my calls in 30,
and my coffee.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.680
It's already
on your desk, sir.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.756
Black, two Stevias,
next to the trades.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.956
Yes. And again,
no "sir," okay?

11:27.080 --> 11:29.753
Call me "Charlie",
"Charlie Mac." Don't call me "sir."

11:29.840 --> 11:31.478
Yes, sir.
I mean, Charlie.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.428
Charlie Mac.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
Stupid joke.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.676
Timothy.
Hey, what's up, man?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.358
I like that coat.
It's nice. Thank you.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.919
Thank you
so much, man.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.391
You are on fire
right now.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.515
I'm trying, man.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.194
What is it, three million
followers on YouTube? Yep.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.236
600 million views
was the last email?

11:50.320 --> 11:51.753
600 million views.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.592
Love it.
So, what's next?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.040
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.640
I think I'm ready
to start this new project.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.320
Mmm-hmm.
I'm trying to be like the Asian Will Smith.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.271
The Asian Will Smith?
Yeah.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.476
TV, movies,
Grammys, all that.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.154
I love it.
I love the ambition. All right?

12:07.240 --> 12:09.117
We're gonna slow it down
just a little bit.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.269
Now, back to YouTube...

12:10.360 --> 12:11.554
[Abram shouting]

12:14.000 --> 12:15.672
Abram, I'm here
with a client.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.035
[sighs]
A client?

12:20.920 --> 12:21.511
Who is he?

12:21.600 --> 12:22.600
An important client.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.153
Okay.
It doesn't matter.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.037
I have real business
to discuss.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.030
Could you excuse me?

12:27.120 --> 12:28.235
Yeah.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.753
I'm sorry.
I didn't shake hands.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.831
What's the very
short version?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.296
Marty is about to call us
in the conference room for a meeting,

12:39.320 --> 12:40.912
'cause I just signed
this huge company.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.656
They have a shitty product,
but it doesn't matter

12:42.680 --> 12:44.336
'cause they threw
a shit-ton of money at it.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.336
And of course,
I told them I could recoup the money.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.669
I just need a brilliant plan
from you, my man,

12:48.760 --> 12:50.896
uh, to make sure that the agency
doesn't get fucked in the ass

12:50.920 --> 12:52.896
for the next 20 years with lawsuits.
You know what I mean?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.114
I hate when you do that.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.576
Hate when I do what?
Sign big companies?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.040
And why are you
still riding on that?

12:57.120 --> 12:57.916
Why do you not
have one of these?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.016
We're about to be in The Jetsons season.
[phone rings]

13:00.040 --> 13:01.376
Premiere Edge,
Charlie Mclntyre's office.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.630
[woman] Conference room
in five minutes. Okay.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.676
That was Marty's assistant. He wants to
meet you in the conference room in five.

13:07.760 --> 13:08.760
All right.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.096
Give me everything
you have on...

13:10.120 --> 13:12.031
Mobilo Tech lndustries.
Mobilo Tech lndustries.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.336
Text it to my phone
immediately.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.112
And tell Tim
"I'm sorry,

13:15.200 --> 13:16.474
"something came up."
All right?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.118
We'll re-schedule,
as soon as possible.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.111
No, he won't
because this is more important.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.518
It's great to meet you.
Thank you so much.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.953
Thank you.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.909
Sit down.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.911
Good morning.
Who was that?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.718
Mobilo Tech.
Have you heard of them?

13:47.840 --> 13:50.229
(Charlie) No.
Neither has the rest of the world.

13:50.760 --> 13:55.390
They created an app that was
obsolete before it even launched.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.478
And what does
this app do, you ask?

13:58.560 --> 13:59.879
Blocks unwanted callers.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.439
So, what's the problem
with that?

14:01.520 --> 14:03.216
Cell phones already have
that feature on the phone.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.559
(Marty)
You're goddamn right!

14:04.640 --> 14:06.835
I can go
to my iPhone right now,

14:06.920 --> 14:09.639
scroll down
to my skank ex-wife's contact

14:09.720 --> 14:12.518
and hit
"block this caller."

14:12.600 --> 14:14.352
Normally,
I would tell these guys

14:14.440 --> 14:16.715
to drive their non-pussy-getting hybrid

14:16.800 --> 14:18.631
off the San Francisco Bay Bridge,

14:18.720 --> 14:20.950
but I can't 'cause we're courting
their parent company.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.039
Oh, it also has
a retina scan component,

14:24.120 --> 14:25.838
for testing
your emotional state,

14:25.920 --> 14:27.069
or some sissy bullshit.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.639
Look, these guys
lost me at "hello."

14:28.760 --> 14:31.115
How do we give
these sagging tits a facelift?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.711
You lost weight.
You look great, Marty.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.358
Ah, thanks.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.318
Back to this app.
Me and Abram were just meeting about it.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.559
We have some great ideas,

14:40.640 --> 14:41.936
just need a little time
to flesh it out.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.712
(Marty) Great, you've got
till Wednesday.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.793
Yeah, I need a happy ending
by Wednesday.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.715
Good talk.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.359
I got no idea
what I'm gonna do.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.136
I gotta come up with
something brilliant, man.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.116
I've never even
heard of Mobilo Tech.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.216
[sighs] I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.070
I thought
you had to work.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.310
Nah, my freaking boss
cut back on my hours.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.079
Permanently?
I don't know.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.600
But it couldn't come
at a worse time.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.995
Do you have any idea
how much peonies cost?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.112
What's a peony? I don't know, but
they sound expensive as shit.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.315
This wedding
is killing me.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.118
And I had to deal
with Ginger talking about

15:13.200 --> 15:15.634
you bringing Fawn
to dinner all night.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.872
My bad.
"My bad."

15:17.960 --> 15:20.496
It wouldn't hurt if you would just
try to get into a relationship.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.192
Like the rest of us.
No.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.800
What happened
to Ginger's friend, Dana?

15:23.880 --> 15:25.711
She was fine,
but that's not the point.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.074
Listen, man,
you know my rules.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.276
Yes, I do know your rules
and those rules are stupid.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.056
They're very smart rules.
They're ridiculous!

15:31.080 --> 15:32.832
Strategic rules.
Especially the shoe thing.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.936
It doesn't make any sense.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.393
If you take
a girl's shoes off,

15:35.480 --> 15:37.320
you're one step closer
to taking her pants off.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.231
Slide move.
That works?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.428
Yeah. Plus,
it's sanitary.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.317
They don't scuff up
your floors...

15:43.400 --> 15:44.549
You've gotta
think, man.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.976
(Victor) Starting to make
a little bit of sense... Hey!

15:47.000 --> 15:49.878
There he goes.
Uh-oh, come on.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.560
Shut up and run.
Come on, struggle bear.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.656
You can do it.
You said you've been working out, man.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.680
Fuck you.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.593
Are you thirsty?
You want some water?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.108
Water is for pussies.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.880
You were talking crazy
about Fawn the other day.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.840
You couldn't go one round
with her in this shape.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.277
Please, sex-durance and hike-durance
are completely different shit.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.376
Pressie and I have been having sex,
like, 10 times a day

16:14.400 --> 16:15.469
trying to have this kid,

16:15.560 --> 16:16.959
and this is way easier
than that.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.759
What'd you just say?

16:18.840 --> 16:20.876
Motherfucker,
I know "sex-durance" isn't a word.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.837
Get off my motherfucking back.
Wait, wait.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.712
I think Chucks
is talking about

16:24.800 --> 16:27.109
you saying you and Pressie
are trying to have a kid.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.520
I said that out loud?
Yeah, you said it out loud.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.016
Are y'all trying
to have a kid or not?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.376
I thought I was using
my inside voice.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.799
Yes, we're trying
to have a kid.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.711
That's awesome, man.
Congratulations.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.074
Why you ain't tell us, man?

16:38.160 --> 16:41.835
Stop messing around. Stop messing around.
She's not pregnant yet.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.712
[screams]

16:46.040 --> 16:47.393
(Charlie)
Wait up!

16:47.480 --> 16:54.113
♫

16:54.240 --> 16:55.514
You put it...

16:55.600 --> 16:57.875
Okay, this is some Fifty Shades shit.
I can't.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.616
Look, I told you, I don't want all
of this stuff at my bachelorette.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.616
Where else are we gonna find
little cups with penises?

17:02.640 --> 17:05.279
Besides, I'm...
I'm not only here for you.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.430
Oh, you and Rick
use toys?

17:07.520 --> 17:10.478
Not usually,
but we need something to spice it up.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.630
Trying to have
this baby is a haze.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.276
And I never thought
I would say this.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.309
I think I hate sex.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.198
[laughs] Oh, no!
That's not good.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.478
Oh. Yeah,
I'm gonna need this.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.876
Oh, girl, you do not want to get
that water-based lube.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.790
Trust me,
it'll dry up so fast

17:27.880 --> 17:28.976
and your man
will be going in,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.136
and you'll be like,
"Oh, hell no."

17:30.160 --> 17:31.434
Oh.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.635
Get the silicone base.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.869
Oh, yes, definitely.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.951
(Ginger)
Excuse me. Uh, hi.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.793
You just seem very
educated on the subject.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.678
Um, my friend here, she's trying
to spice up her sex life.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.877
Do you have, um,
anything that you would suggest?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.592
Do I?
How much time you got?

17:46.680 --> 17:47.749
[laughs]

17:47.840 --> 17:49.796
Girl, you must be
trying to have a baby.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.638
Me and my man went
through the same thing.

17:52.400 --> 17:56.313
All right, uh,
this miniature whip

17:56.400 --> 17:58.550
is good for when he's
slacking off with the stroke.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.989
Give him a little pow.
Oh!

18:01.600 --> 18:03.560
(French Montana)
♫ I ain't worried 'bout nothin' ♫

18:03.600 --> 18:04.976
♫ Nigga, I ain't worried
'bout nothin' ♫

18:05.000 --> 18:06.752
I don't understand
how she does that.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.990
I don't know why you don't
want to see her again.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.513
Guys,
I've moved on.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.238
Look, you should too,
all right?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.240
Man, I'm just trying to live
vicariously through you.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.680
Hey!

18:17.920 --> 18:19.478
Hey, Charlie.
The usual? Yes, sir.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.834
Hey, y'all want anything?

18:20.920 --> 18:21.989
(Victor)
Nope. Cool.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.616
And make sure to send me the schedule
for the juice truck next week.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.776
Absolutely, man.
I'll do that.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.869
Hot dog! Yes, sir!

18:27.000 --> 18:28.194
Hey, Caroline.
Hi.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.112
[sighs]
You, sir.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.760
I gotta say,
all these one-night stands,

18:33.840 --> 18:35.136
I think you're missing out, brother.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.388
I'm with Vic
on this one.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.256
Guys, what the hell
am I missing out on, all right.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.271
You jack off to pictures
of the women I date.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.918
Okay, first of all,
that was one time.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.680
And you said
you weren't gonna say nothin'.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.595
Is that the chick...

18:51.440 --> 18:53.510
Holy shit.
That's her.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.635
Who?

18:54.720 --> 18:56.597
Don't... Don't look.
Don't look, all right?

18:56.720 --> 18:57.776
What am I not looking at?
Guys, stop looking.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.994
She's right there.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.197
That's the dime piece I was telling you
all about from work the other day.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.679
She left before
I could holler.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.432
God damn,
I would tear that ass up.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.795
Hey, hey, it's not
always about sex, Charlie.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.711
Says Mr. Celibacy.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.472
Hey, I bet if you
were with a woman

19:11.560 --> 19:13.016
and gave it a shot
you'd get caught up.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.616
That you could actually
have a conversation with.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.437
No, I would not.
Yeah, you would.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.192
No, I wouldn't.
How do you know?

19:18.280 --> 19:19.998
You never even tried.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.230
Yeah, because
I know me, all right?

19:22.320 --> 19:25.471
Look, you've been dreaming about being
with Ginger since we were kids.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.856
You've been dreaming about having
little Ricky's running around.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.896
I've been dreaming about making money,
driving a fast car,

19:29.920 --> 19:30.670
and fucking models.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.760
We're not built the same.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.791
I call bullshit.
Bullshit, homey.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.000
Sorry, you're just covering.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.594
You are trying to protect yourself
from falling in love.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.616
Dude, I don't know what
y'all are talking about, man.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.376
All right, so take us on a bet.
(Victor) Mmm-hmm.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.233
You date a woman
till Vic's wedding,

19:44.320 --> 19:45.416
and see if you get attached.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.668
The same woman.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.557
What does that mean?
So I gotta date one.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.720
I could smash other joints.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.028
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.473
You don't get
to date and smash.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.788
It's a package deal.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.273
Date one, smash one. One.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.635
So I gotta date one girl
and hang with the same girl?

19:57.760 --> 20:00.593
Yes, dating and hanging.
That's kinda how it works. Until his wedding.

20:00.680 --> 20:01.680
My wedding.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.231
Deal.
I'll take you up.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.356
One woman until
Victor's wedding.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.714
And when
I do this,

20:07.800 --> 20:10.240
the two of y'all will agree
to never bring this shit up again.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.311
All right. And when
you don't do this,

20:12.400 --> 20:14.868
our reward will be
finally seeing you happy.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.712
Nah, I don't like that reward.
No?

20:16.800 --> 20:21.032
My reward idea would be something
like a 3D, flat screen television.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.033
You know what?
Let's keep it 100. How about this?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.753
When you lose this bet,

20:29.880 --> 20:32.000
I get to deliver the best
man's speech at his wedding.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.229
Are you okay
with this?

20:33.320 --> 20:34.833
I am all kinds
of okay with it.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.672
Deal. To the eye's.
Mmm.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.232
To the eye's.
I got you.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.816
Make it real. To the eye's.
There it is.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.751
(Nate) Greek Goddess,
cayenne, dark chocolate.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.840
Idiot.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.274
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's...

20:47.360 --> 20:48.236
This is mine.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.555
That's a Greek Goddess
with cayenne and dark chocolate.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.154
That's my drink.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.913
Eva.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.434
I saw you earlier this
week at Premiere Edge.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.953
Yeah, you did.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.399
So...
So...

21:03.160 --> 21:04.878
I'm a dime, huh?
Yes, you are.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.710
And you would
tear my ass up.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.994
(Charlie)
Oh, shit.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.350
You heard
our conversation.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.556
Yeah, you boys
were kinda loud.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.748
I'm sorry.
Let me make it up to you.

21:17.840 --> 21:18.936
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.269
No, no.
Hold on. Hold on.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.600
Here's my card.
Let me take you out.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.359
(Eva)
No, but thank you.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.432
I know your type.
You're the Lothario, right?

21:28.560 --> 21:32.269
The Lothario? Yeah. You think you
know everything about women.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.800
You could teach me
what I don't know.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.760
You couldn't handle me.
(Nate) Greek Goddess with cayenne and dark chocolate.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.592
But good luck with your bet.
[man yells]

21:39.680 --> 21:40.874
Oh, shit, man.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.430
It's all good.
I probably deserved that.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.038
Sorry about that,
Charlie.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.278
I got this.
It's all good.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.112
It's all...
Don't worry about it.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.473
That was very
valiant of you, Charlie.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.389
Your drink is ready.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.759
Damn.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.755
Hey, Kareem,
I need that research on Mobilo Tech.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.957
Sir, um... Send it to my...
What are you...

22:10.040 --> 22:11.314
Hello?

22:11.400 --> 22:12.674
Avatia is here.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.320
She wants me to purify the
space before she comes in.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.913
Karen, you know
you're supposed

22:17.000 --> 22:18.576
to schedule with Kareem
and not just show up?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.600
What are you...
I'm sorry.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.238
I'm using
the purification app.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.193
Seriously?
What are you doin'?

22:24.320 --> 22:26.675
[sighs]
Avatia is driving me nuts.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.080
She's driven everyone away. Just about
everybody has quit. The housekeeper has quit.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.997
The feng shui
specialist has quit.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.588
Do you know her
Italian Greyhound ran away?

22:34.680 --> 22:37.194
Only it didn't run away.
It went to a neighbor's house

22:37.280 --> 22:39.748
because it just wanted
to get away from Avatia.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.628
Okay. Okay, Karen.
Calm down, all right?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.392
I'll fix it.
Send her in.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.272
That's all, Boris.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.113
Avatia. Seriously?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.509
Oh, my spiritual advisor
says that I should conserve

23:01.600 --> 23:03.670
my personal energy,
whenever I can.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.376
And it's good to keep
your feet off the Earth

23:05.400 --> 23:06.719
for at least an hour a day.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.438
You know couches
do that, right?

23:09.320 --> 23:12.676
Oh, so all this on Twitter about you
acting like a crazy diva is true?

23:12.760 --> 23:14.640
You know what?
I don't appreciate that, Charlie,

23:14.680 --> 23:16.955
but my advisor says
that I can't engage

23:17.080 --> 23:19.196
in any negative
facial expressions.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.759
So, Karen does
that for me now.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.397
Karen.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.198
[growls]
(Charlie) You gotta be kidding me.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.079
Oh, y'all
are serious?

23:25.160 --> 23:27.230
Boris, whole
purification act.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.515
Babe, this is all
hurting your fan base.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.318
People want their stars
to be relatable.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.072
Right now, your fans
are unfollowing you

23:33.160 --> 23:35.037
as fast as they're
creating memes about you.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.120
[snaps fingers]
Karen.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.397
Look, Avatia.
I believe in you,

23:40.840 --> 23:42.637
but this is
a big opportunity.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.711
You're up for a major
part in a Marvel film.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.976
But the studio's
not gonna hire you,

23:46.000 --> 23:46.876
if they think
you're gonna be trouble.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.473
I am not trouble.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.910
That...
Did you spray that in my hair?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.672
No, no, no.
...is trouble.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.155
You know,
I know you.

23:56.960 --> 23:57.960
Huh?

23:59.320 --> 24:01.880
You do this every
time you get afraid.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.958
This is a new career for you.
I get it.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.040
[sighs]

24:05.800 --> 24:08.997
Listen, the director and his team
want to meet me.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.936
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll be right there with you.

24:10.960 --> 24:11.960
They said alone.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.675
I'll fix it.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.115
Okay?
Okay.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.430
You and me, we'll take
this first step together, okay?

24:19.440 --> 24:20.736
All right, now,
I want you to get up.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.991
Boris, stop.
Just stop, all right?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.079
Just stand down.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.713
We'll take this first step
together, okay?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.836
Cut all that
craziness out.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.399
But my spiritual
advisor says...

24:33.480 --> 24:35.630
Should concentrate
on your spirit.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.438
I got your career.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Okay.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.593
You go,
you pop star, you.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.159
Okay. Bye, bye.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.310
Knock 'em dead.
All right, now.

24:47.400 --> 24:51.188
Oh, my God.
Charlie, you are like...

24:51.280 --> 24:53.271
The Diva Whisperer.
Yeah.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.437
Thank you.
All in a day's work.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.794
You know,
that's what I do.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.838
I heard.
You did my friend Julie.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.675
Julie...

25:02.760 --> 25:04.113
Did you
not call her?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.269
Yeah.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.913
I'm worried
about your karma.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.239
I thought l...
I didn't text her?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.308
This is my gift to you.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.475
Namaste.

25:18.840 --> 25:19.909
[phone beeps]

25:28.640 --> 25:30.631
I'm surprised
you texted me.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.757
I'll admit, I'm intrigued
by your situation.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.319
You really think
some people

25:36.400 --> 25:38.675
aren't meant to be
in relationships?

25:39.560 --> 25:41.437
I believe everyone's
different.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.716
So, you've never been
in a long-term relationship?

25:44.800 --> 25:45.994
No. You?

25:47.720 --> 25:50.188
I've never been
in a short relationship.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.429
So why are we here?

25:51.520 --> 25:53.590
Well...

25:53.680 --> 25:55.557
I'm not sure that you're
my type, Charlie.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.834
But I like that
about you.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.576
Well, I'm not sure
you're my type.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.033
Really?
Yeah.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.912
What's your type?
Fun...

26:03.000 --> 26:04.149
No expectations.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.714
So, no strings, right?
No strings.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.318
Well, you might be right.
Maybe I'm not your type.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.076
But...

26:15.160 --> 26:16.718
I wanna try something new.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.958
Something different.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.118
But I can't be
in a relationship right now.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.519
So, what are you saying?

26:22.640 --> 26:24.710
So, I'm saying...

26:24.800 --> 26:26.153
keep your phone handy.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.336
(Kareem)
♫ I ain't worried 'bout nothin' ♫

26:29.360 --> 26:32.432
♫ I ain't worried 'bout nothin' ♫

26:32.840 --> 26:34.120
♫ I ain't worried
'bout nothin' ♫

26:34.200 --> 26:36.156
Kareem...
♫ Ridin' round with that work ♫

26:36.600 --> 26:37.800
♫ Strapped up with that Nina ♫

26:37.880 --> 26:39.711
♫ Got two bad bitches with me ♫
Kareem?

26:40.840 --> 26:42.751
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.276
I was just talking
to my ex on my phone.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.396
And I'm worried.
I mean, I'm not worried.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.436
You know,
'cause I got it all under control.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.016
And there's nothin' to worry about.
No, no, no.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.951
It was... Stop.
No need to apologize.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.056
(Kareem) It ain't nothin' to worry about,
I'm sorry.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.399
That's brilliant.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.696
(Kareem) That shouldn't
have happened, at all.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.312
Get my sister
on the phone.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.279
[phone ringing]

27:06.360 --> 27:08.749
Yes, uh, I'm calling
from Charlie Mclntyre's office.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.913
Too thirsty.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.878
Sir, uh, Charlie...
Not "Sir Charlie."

27:42.280 --> 27:43.280
Your sister's
on the line.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.040
Tell her,
I'll hit her from the car.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.997
[doorbell rings]

28:17.600 --> 28:18.919
Hey.
Hey.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.913
I wasn't sure you
were still coming.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Me, either.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.351
Um, uh, water.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.998
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah?

28:37.680 --> 28:40.069
Do you... Do you want still
or sparkling?

28:44.880 --> 28:46.154
Holy shit.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.160
Hmm, think
you might've busted my lip.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.438
I'm sorry.
I get pretty excited.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.189
No need
for an apology.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.838
[sighs]

29:48.920 --> 29:50.512
I'll get you
some water.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
Thank you.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.633
Do you actually
have wine?

29:54.720 --> 29:56.915
(Charlie) Yep. As a matter
of fact, I do.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.553
Is this a LaChappelle?

30:01.040 --> 30:03.315
(Charlie) No, actually.
It's mine.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.119
You have a great eye.
What do you shoot with?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.071
I used a Nikon D700
for that.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.510
But you know, what I really
want is a vintage Leica.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.034
It's just hard to find.
Those things are like tanks.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.120
You into photography?

30:16.800 --> 30:18.080
It looks good on you,
by the way.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.718
Well, I'm into
a lot of things.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.399
Really?
Really.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.152
Cheers.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.558
Mmm.
Mmm.

30:27.640 --> 30:28.675
That's good.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.795
What is this?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.799
It's Carmenere.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.200
I call it the
House of Cards wine,

30:33.240 --> 30:34.776
'cause that's what they
were drinking on the show.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
It's so good.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.717
This is the same wine that Claire
Underwood drinks on the show?

30:39.800 --> 30:40.835
Don't...
Don't do that.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.560
Don't try to act like you
know about House of Cards,

30:43.600 --> 30:44.669
to, like,
connect with me.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.160
That's like...
Don't try to do that.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.679
Stop.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.875
You're into
House of Cards?

30:48.960 --> 30:50.279
Who isn't into
House of Cards?

30:50.360 --> 30:52.874
That's my show.
I love that show.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.757
So, this situation, then?

30:54.840 --> 30:55.840
Mmm-hmm?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.035
It's just fun.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.633
No attachments.
No strings, right?

30:59.040 --> 31:02.510
Look at this face.
All fun, no attachments. [laughs]

31:02.600 --> 31:03.640
None of that.
It's all fun?

31:03.680 --> 31:05.432
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.239
Well, good.
'Cause I need fun.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.358
You do?
I do.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.239
I need fun.
Mmm, who doesn't?

31:17.280 --> 31:18.679
Give me another one.
Come here.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.991
Hey, baby.
Close the door.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.308
Baby.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.031
Okay, I know I have
some strong swimmers,

31:30.120 --> 31:31.840
but I don't think they
could swim that fast.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.559
I'm not one of your hussies
on your dating show, Rick, okay?

31:34.640 --> 31:35.640
I'm a fucking lady.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.312
Close the door!

31:37.840 --> 31:38.840
Ugh.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.150
Hey, I'm gonna go down
and make some hot cocoa.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.356
You want some?
Of course I do.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.477
[chuckling]

31:54.160 --> 31:55.229
All right.

31:55.320 --> 31:59.677
Here's your hot cocoa
with all the accoutrements.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.953
I got some
tiny marshmallows,

32:03.040 --> 32:06.032
got the whipped cream,

32:06.120 --> 32:09.112
and a little bourbon to
take the edge off. Rick!

32:10.680 --> 32:12.591
What? You know
I can't be drinking.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.336
If that test in there
comes out positive,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.376
our baby's gonna come out with
her eyes too close together.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.356
Babe, I was playin'.
The bourbon is for me.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.112
Ugh.
Why you playin'?

32:21.280 --> 32:22.816
What if something's
really wrong with us?

32:22.840 --> 32:25.308
There's nothing wrong with us,
honey, I promise.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.913
We've been trying
for seven months.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.353
Yeah, that
sounds about right.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.039
You just got off
of birth control.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.240
Just because
you love vagina,

32:31.280 --> 32:32.616
doesn't mean
you're a gynecologist.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.232
I never said
I was a gynecologist.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.390
I just think
you're overreacting.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.033
And by "overreacting" I mean we
just need to give it more time.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.280
Oh.
Yeah.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.520
Look, if the test is negative,
we can always try again.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.639
Oh! I don't wanna have any more sex.
What?

32:46.720 --> 32:47.994
This shit
has become work,

32:48.080 --> 32:49.399
and I don't
wanna work.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.879
I wanna be
a stay-at-home mom.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.270
I hear that.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.954
If you hear that,
put the whipped cream down.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.474
I want a baby.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.788
Come here.

33:00.880 --> 33:01.880
[sighs]

33:03.240 --> 33:04.468
Look,
if the test is negative,

33:04.560 --> 33:06.710
I promise we'll go
to the fertility specialist.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.838
For real?
For real.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.797
You promise?
I promise.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.037
You're crazy.
You know that, right?

33:16.560 --> 33:18.391
I know.
Yeah.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.558
I like that
about you, though.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.056
Let's go see
if we got a plus or minus.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.752
Come on.
Come on.

33:26.360 --> 33:31.480
♫

33:31.560 --> 33:33.152
French Montana.
You're Charlie, right?

33:33.280 --> 33:35.271
Yeah, man.
What up?

33:35.360 --> 33:37.256
We met at Puff's house
at the pool party that time.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.030
No, I remember.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.720
You got them big
endorsement deals, man.

33:39.800 --> 33:40.915
The big money man.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.479
Yo, now, that's
what I do, man.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.152
Try to make money
for my clients, yo.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.958
It's so random
running into you here, man.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.917
The universe must be
bringing us together,

33:48.240 --> 33:49.753
'cause I got
a deal on the table

33:49.880 --> 33:51.360
that will be a big check
for you, man.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.075
If you're talkin' them kinda numbers
you got him, man, sign me in now.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.718
All right,
let's do this, man.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.155
Stop by the Premier Edge office.
Let me sign you up.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.616
Hold on, before
you sign me up, dawg,

34:00.640 --> 34:01.976
I gotta make sure
your swag is right.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.558
Make sure,
you know what I mean?

34:03.640 --> 34:05.551
French, it's Charlie Mac
you're talking to.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.232
Make sure you rollin'
in the hannghhh!

34:07.360 --> 34:09.793
I got the hannghhh!
Hannghhh!

34:10.960 --> 34:12.438
Hannghhh!
Hannghhh!

34:12.520 --> 34:13.520
Nah, you ain't got it.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.393
But I fuck wit' you, though.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.480
You know
what I'm sayin'?

34:19.360 --> 34:21.715
Yeah, man, so, I mean,
let's exchange numbers...

34:21.800 --> 34:22.880
Put my number
in your phone.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.552
If you find any kind of deal,
you know.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.391
Okay, yeah.
Charlie.

34:26.639 --> 34:27.516
Nice to meet you.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.397
I gotta check
in with Julius real quick.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.152
Yeah, listen,
I'm great with managers.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.833
Send him my contact info.
Tell him to call me. We'll work it out.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.239
I like that suit
though, playboy.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.136
Thank you. You know, I'm keepin'
it together, man.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.717
You look sharp.
I need a chain maybe.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.630
Yo, I gotta ask you, man.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.391
If there's only
three of y'all,

34:42.480 --> 34:44.471
why does everybody
drive their own car?

34:44.600 --> 34:45.748
Space.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.159
You never know who you gonna kidnap
by the end of the night, my brother.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.992
Now, you make sure
you use that contact.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.917
Will do, man.
Let's make this money.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.512
Did you catch him?
Yes.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.696
Well, I hope
it was worth it.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.711
That was on the verge
of being unethical.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.759
I mean, in fact, I'm pretty sure
I was completely unethical.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.273
You owe me big time,
little brother.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.314
I'm taking you to lunch.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.870
A real lunch?
A real lunch.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.514
A proper lunch?
A proper lunch.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.158
No juice?
No juice.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.598
That makes
me so happy.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.560
That means we'll have time
for a good long chat.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.949
There's so much that
you and I need to discuss.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.656
Because you're at a pinnacle age,
right now...

35:22.680 --> 35:24.477
No. Mmm-mmm.
Not happening.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.136
We're not talking
about my personal life, okay?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.856
But I do need to know
about French's manager.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.029
Who's this dude Julius?

35:29.120 --> 35:31.998
Oh, Julius, yeah. He's the
one that referred me to him.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.474
He's a monkey.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.590
But he's a very reasonable man...
Monkey.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.837
All right... Listen, I would not
underestimate Julius.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.433
He's important
to that man's life.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.576
I don't know
if you're playin'...

35:44.600 --> 35:46.556
He's his guide.
He's his spiritual teacher.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.638
Would you please
slow down?

35:48.720 --> 35:50.536
I don't even know how you
walk so fast in those shoes.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.074
Okay, this is the place in LA
to get your wedding cake.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.000
They're, like, booked up
five months in advance

35:55.040 --> 35:56.936
for a cake tasting appointment,
we can't be late.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.256
Yes, but online, it says they
give out boxes of free samples

35:59.280 --> 36:00.474
with no appointment
necessary.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.936
So it's not even...
Okay, you know what?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.791
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.550
We cannot get our wedding
cake from a sample rack.

36:09.640 --> 36:13.189
But it's so sweet that you
took interest in it, baby.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.316
You, like, went online
and did... Oh, oh...

36:19.080 --> 36:20.399
Thank you.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.034
Did you know
that Oprah said

36:23.120 --> 36:25.588
if she ever got married that she
would get her cake from here?

36:25.680 --> 36:27.398
I mean, we're
just like Oprah.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.879
Why would I
know that?

36:28.960 --> 36:30.678
Hello. We're here
for the cake tasting.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.512
Jesus Christ.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.436
Fuck me!

36:37.120 --> 36:38.269
[mouthing]
I'm sorry.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.550
Um, baby...

36:44.280 --> 36:46.157
Yeah, so listen.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.755
Oprah probably isn't getting
married at this point,

36:49.840 --> 36:51.416
so we should probably
take that as a sign

36:51.440 --> 36:53.351
and then get our cake
from somewhere else.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.755
No! We're gonna
get our cake here...

36:56.400 --> 36:57.958
Mmm. With all your extras.
Come on.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.756
Enjoy.
Thank you.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.478
Thank you,
sweetheart.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.114
Here we go.
Yeah. Looks delicious.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.359
Mmm, that's delicious.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.396
It is.
It tastes really expensive.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.232
Hmm, carrot cake.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.471
Is it 24 karats
for 6,000 fucking dollars?

37:24.120 --> 37:26.031
Well, take a seat,
gentlemen.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.553
Marty will be
right with you.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.680
Thank you.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.637
Can I get you anything,
Charlie?

37:31.720 --> 37:32.869
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.839
What's up.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.070
No, please.
Don't worry about me, Chesty.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.557
I'm fine. I wasn't
thirsty anyways, you know?

37:41.640 --> 37:43.312
Thanks for asking.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.590
Abram. Abram!

37:48.200 --> 37:50.316
Just try not to be offensive
for the next 10 minutes.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.992
When am I
ever offensive?

37:53.360 --> 37:54.156
Fine.
Here's the deal.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.656
We're gonna walk in there.
You're gonna let me do all the talking.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.830
You just nod your head,

37:59.440 --> 38:01.715
give an occasional
"It's a no-brainer"

38:01.840 --> 38:03.512
here and there,
all right?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.511
Long story short,
just don't fuck this up.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.479
I'll be as smooth as Barry
White after a bikini wax.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.235
(Marty)
Okay, send them in.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.840
[sighs]

38:14.920 --> 38:15.920
He's ready for you.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.673
Okay, gentlemen.
Knock my fuckin' socks off.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.478
It's a no-brainer.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.108
We need new talent.
Mmm-hmm.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.316
We need to work from the
talent we already have

38:26.400 --> 38:28.789
and we need to find a way
to make this app relevant.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.394
I have a way to...
We have a way to.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.959
We have a way
to do all three.

38:33.080 --> 38:33.956
Explain.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.514
I signed French Montana.
Who?

38:36.600 --> 38:38.033
♫ I ain't worried 'bout nothin' ♫

38:38.120 --> 38:39.917
♫ Ridin' round with that Nina ♫

38:40.000 --> 38:41.991
♫ Ridin' round
with that AK ♫

38:43.360 --> 38:45.351
It's his song.
I'm just gonna be...

38:45.760 --> 38:46.954
Uh...

38:47.040 --> 38:50.191
Well, that's fan-fucking-tastic,
Charlie.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.076
How'd you do it?

38:51.160 --> 38:52.912
I promised him
a multi-million dollar

38:53.000 --> 38:55.195
licensing deal
with Mobilo Tech.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.315
Elaborate.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.153
First of all,
this app doesn't suck.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.118
You see, most smart phones
don't seamlessly block

39:02.200 --> 39:04.191
all of your unwanted calls
or texts.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.869
This app does. It also blocks
them from your social media,

39:07.960 --> 39:10.554
but that's not
the most revolutionary part.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.517
Sir! Sir!

39:12.600 --> 39:15.478
It uses retina
recognition technology

39:15.560 --> 39:18.154
to determine
your emotional state of mind.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.471
So before you get
to drunk dial, it saves you.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.896
I mean, it's kind of just like
the alcohol breathalyzer thing.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.016
You know, you breathe into it
before you drive the car.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.553
I...
I don't have one...

39:27.640 --> 39:31.030
Secondly. Another one of my
clients is a big YouTube star.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.235
Millions of followers.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.596
We're gonna get him
to post an "organic" video

39:35.680 --> 39:37.591
about blocking
an ex-girlfriend,

39:37.680 --> 39:39.159
but then missing her.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.277
Getting a little too drunk
and going to call her

39:42.360 --> 39:44.715
and then getting
saved by the app.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.472
Meanwhile,
we'll have French Montana's

39:46.560 --> 39:49.074
I Ain't Worried About Nothin'
playin' in the background

39:49.160 --> 39:50.957
because he won't have to.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.349
And now that we own
the licensing to it,

39:53.440 --> 39:55.237
that video
is gonna be shared

39:55.320 --> 39:56.548
tens of millions
of views.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.073
Here's the bottom line.

39:58.160 --> 40:01.994
Our YouTube star is gonna get
some big advertising dollars.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.232
French Montana
gets a big licensing fee.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.916
Mobilo Tech's downloads?
Through the roof.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.230
And the best part is, Marty,

40:13.320 --> 40:15.038
we get a piece
of all the action.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.189
It's a no-brainer.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.675
[phone rings]

40:21.240 --> 40:23.708
Oh, uh, Kareem,
go on without me.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.670
Yeah,
I'll see you downstairs.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.040
Hello.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.519
Hey.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.715
A phone call.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.753
No, I know.
Everyone texts.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.990
I like phone calls.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.429
It's more personal.
Not that we're personal.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.990
Well, it just so happens that I have
an opening in my schedule for lunch.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.469
You know,
that's such a coincidence.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.560
I have an opening in my
schedule for lunch as well.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.397
Really?
Really.

40:51.560 --> 40:54.870
Have you ever been
to Red O on Melrose?

40:54.960 --> 40:57.349
(Charlie) No, but I'm sure
I could find it.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.035
See you there
in 20 minutes?

41:01.120 --> 41:02.314
Nineteen.

That was great.
Unbelievable.

42:36.800 --> 42:37.800
Bye.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.560

See you later.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.391
[high voice]
I'm coming.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.276
Hi, hello.
How are you doing?

42:55.360 --> 42:57.715
It's all yours.
It's all yours.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.991
Yo, yo!
Here we go.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.593
There he is.
What's up, Vic?

43:15.680 --> 43:16.816
You know, I'm good.
How're you?

43:16.840 --> 43:18.956
Good to see you.

43:19.040 --> 43:22.430
Well, look who decided to
bless us with his presence.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.976
Don't do that, all right? You just
sent the text, like five minutes ago.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.833
Look, we had a date
scheduled with our DVR.

43:27.920 --> 43:30.559
We want to watch six episodes of Power.
What's goin' on?

43:30.640 --> 43:32.437
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.520
What was so important you
had to tell us in person?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.835
Do I have all your attention?
(Rick) We're here, yes.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.035
(Pressie)
Come on.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.032
Well, you guys are now
looking at the senior editor

43:43.120 --> 43:45.873
of the Lifestyle
section of NetNews.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.552
[all cheering]
It's me.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.198
I did it!

43:50.640 --> 43:51.640
(Charlie)
Nice!

43:51.720 --> 43:53.472
Hold on, hold on.
So, what does this mean?

43:53.560 --> 43:55.096
Full creative control
over the whole thing?

43:55.120 --> 43:57.475
It is. And they, uh,
they doubled my salary.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.516
[all cheering]

43:59.600 --> 44:00.874
That's worth a toast.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.160
All right.
Gettin' that paper, baby.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.309
Thank you.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.193
I'll be right back.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.056
Now you can pay me back
that money you owe me.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.991
Yes. Yes.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.999
Yo.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.559
Yo, man.
Hmm.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.416
You seem a little bummed.
That's good news, man.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.874
It is...
It is good news.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.473
Hey, man. Good news. Good news.

44:28.600 --> 44:29.316
Yep, okay.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.516
So, I have a question
for you guys.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.556
Would you come
to my wedding

44:33.640 --> 44:36.791
if it was
in a park?

44:36.880 --> 44:38.393
Fuck, yeah.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.835
I'm not sure your fiance would,
but I'd be there.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.640
Clearly, we're talkin'
about something else.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.999
What's up?
You know what?

44:45.080 --> 44:46.752
I don't even wanna
talk about it.

44:46.840 --> 44:48.796
New topic.
You. The bet.

44:48.880 --> 44:49.880
What's the update?
Uh-huh.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.154
Oh, you know what?

44:51.240 --> 44:52.360
This might cheer
you up, man.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.158
Now, seriously...

44:54.240 --> 44:55.070
I met a girl.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.718
I told you.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.438
I mean, this girl
is special, man.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.999
When she walks
in the room,

45:00.080 --> 45:03.311
it's like I hear Michael
Jackson's Butterflies.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.536
Like, you remember how you felt
at the end of The Notebook?

45:05.560 --> 45:06.390
Dude, oh, really?

45:06.480 --> 45:07.799
It's like that every...
Really?

45:07.880 --> 45:10.110
Yes, it's like...
No, man. Come on, guys.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.792
What the fuck
is wrong with y'all, man?

45:11.880 --> 45:13.871
Dawg, you think
I'm gonna fall for some...

45:13.960 --> 45:17.714
No! The sex is amazing.
She's cool, but I'm good.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.869
Not everybody
wants that.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.315
You're a dickhead, man.
A shitty human being.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.590
Thank you. What more should
we expect from the guy

45:23.680 --> 45:26.274
who put out a "wanted" ad
for a fuck buddy in college, right?

45:26.360 --> 45:28.112
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.755
We're getting old.
We're getting very old.

45:32.840 --> 45:34.976
Yeah, but you like 19-year-old girls,
so it doesn't matter.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.911
Check it out. Check it out.
Look, look, look.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.478
You know what?
Um...

45:41.840 --> 45:42.909
How are you, man?

45:43.000 --> 45:45.639
Can I get a round of whatever
they're drinking sent over,

45:45.760 --> 45:48.672
and my card,
as well.

45:48.760 --> 45:50.591
Thank you.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.715
What?

45:51.800 --> 45:53.631
For after the wedding.
Seriously.

45:53.720 --> 45:55.233
'Cause after
I win this bet,

45:55.320 --> 45:57.151
I'm gettin' right back
to where I started.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.279
Why are we
friends with him?

46:00.400 --> 46:02.376
'Cause he's the best ho
we ever met in our life, man.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.879
Man, that dude would
fuck everything.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.199
Coffee's bad for you.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.591
What's up, champ?

46:17.680 --> 46:20.319
(Charlie) Don't you think it's strange
Marty's coming down here?

46:20.400 --> 46:21.913
I've never seen him
out of his office.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.376
Maybe he's coming
to give us a handjob

46:23.400 --> 46:24.616
and tell us
we just made partner.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.153
(Marty)
Good morning, gentlemen.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.593
Morning, sir.
So...

46:29.000 --> 46:31.309
I was lying in bed
last night, thinking.

46:31.400 --> 46:34.551
I often do my best thinking
after a nice rub and tug,

46:35.520 --> 46:37.476
and my thoughts
reflected on,

46:37.560 --> 46:42.111
are we eking out the most
profit we can from this deal?

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
The French Montana deal?

46:43.480 --> 46:45.198
No, the fucking
Vanilla lce deal.

46:46.520 --> 46:48.476
Yes, the French Montana deal.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.016
You're planning to put
him out on tour, yeah?

46:50.040 --> 46:52.120
Yeah, absolutely.
I actually wanted to tell you guys,

46:52.160 --> 46:53.752
Drake's people just called.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.200
They wanna go out
on tour with him.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.753
Wow!
Did you tell him yet?

46:56.840 --> 46:58.239
No, not yet...
Don't.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.840
Let's put him out on the Premier
Edge tour we're planning to promote.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.592
He'll be our headliner,

47:03.680 --> 47:04.856
shining his light
on our clients

47:04.880 --> 47:05.936
that we're aiming
to promote.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.678
That's brilliant, sir.
Thank you.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.677
Sir, sir?
Hold on.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.671
That doesn't make sense.

47:11.760 --> 47:13.256
Why would he do
the Premiere Edge tour,

47:13.280 --> 47:15.640
when he'd make way more money
if he went on tour with Drake?

47:15.680 --> 47:17.591
Right,
but Premiere Edge will.

47:18.400 --> 47:19.549
He'll be
the headliner.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.631
First time, the first guy
through the door.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.154
And it's good
for the ego.

47:24.240 --> 47:25.440
What, are
you banging this guy?

47:26.240 --> 47:27.958
[sighs]
No, sir.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.359
Whose name are
on your checks,

47:29.440 --> 47:30.919
Premiere Edge
or French Vanilla?

47:31.000 --> 47:32.479
Premiere Edge.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.391
And it's French Montana, sir.

47:34.480 --> 47:35.629
Make it happen.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.675
Good talk.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.440
Why are you arguing with Marty?

47:41.520 --> 47:44.176
We just signed French, and the first
thing we're gonna do is screw him?

47:44.200 --> 47:45.296
Technically, it's
the second thing.

47:45.320 --> 47:47.515
I mean, you just signed a huge
multi-million dollar

47:47.600 --> 47:48.600
licensing deal for him.

47:48.640 --> 47:49.550
That's not the point.

47:49.640 --> 47:52.074
We still gotta tell him that
Drake wants to go out on tour.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.878
Believe it or not,
I agree with you.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.951
It is fucked up, okay?

47:56.040 --> 47:57.473
But we work
for Premiere Edge,

47:57.600 --> 47:58.840
and that's how
they do business.

47:58.920 --> 48:01.150
Yeah, but that's not how
I wanna do business.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
We can be better.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.874
I think you're
too close to this, man.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.696
Just give it some time
to think about it, okay?

48:06.720 --> 48:08.915
I mean, besides, it's not like
it was a suggestion.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
You feel me?

48:11.040 --> 48:12.040
[sighs]

48:12.680 --> 48:13.908
Out.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.830
Okay.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.717
[sighs]

48:24.360 --> 48:25.634

48:27.760 --> 48:28.795
[exhales]

48:30.840 --> 48:32.717
Hey.
Hey.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.352
How you doing?
Good.

48:38.960 --> 48:39.960
You okay?

48:40.040 --> 48:41.598
You seem
a little distracted.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.591
No, I'm fine.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.113
Why you ask that?

48:45.200 --> 48:48.476
Because you usually try
to take my clothes off at the door.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.476
Do you want a drink?
Yeah.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.233
Vodka?

48:57.320 --> 48:58.514
Yeah.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.795
And do you
want a double?

49:04.200 --> 49:05.200
Double, please.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.072
Are those, uh,
Tim Biskup?

49:10.800 --> 49:12.120
You got a good eye,
you know that?

49:12.160 --> 49:13.275
[chuckles]

49:13.360 --> 49:14.509
I love his stuff.

49:15.200 --> 49:16.200
Me, too.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.639
So, you know,
it's okay,

49:18.720 --> 49:20.153
if you wanna do this
another time.

49:20.600 --> 49:23.194
No. No, no.
It... It...

49:23.280 --> 49:24.508
None of this
is about you.

49:24.600 --> 49:25.953
It's... It's work.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.918
You know, it got me stressed
out like a motherfucker.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.037
They want me to do something
that's just crazy.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.155
So, then don't do it.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.077
What, just like that?

49:35.200 --> 49:36.600
No one's holding a
gun to your head.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.959
It's not that simple.

49:43.560 --> 49:44.993
You forgot
to take your shoes off.

49:45.080 --> 49:46.798
You know what
you need to do?

49:51.880 --> 49:55.350
♫

49:55.440 --> 49:57.510
(Victor)
How is this not porn?

49:58.200 --> 49:58.996
It's on MTV.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.229
Mmm, no, no.
[bell ringing]

50:00.320 --> 50:01.736
[man]
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

50:01.760 --> 50:04.194
for another episode
of Dating in the Buff.

50:04.280 --> 50:06.032
That's a wrap.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.433
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

50:10.040 --> 50:11.456
I bet you're thinking
about all the ass

50:11.480 --> 50:12.976
you're not gonna get
after you're married, huh?

50:13.000 --> 50:14.274
A little bit.
A little bit.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.656
Thanks for
calling us out, baby.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.829
Hey, anytime, anytime.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.388
I figured butt naked
females on the beach

50:21.480 --> 50:23.118
is a great break
from wedding errands.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.713
Yeah, yeah,
that definitely beats

50:24.800 --> 50:26.199
picking up
centerpieces for sure.

50:26.280 --> 50:28.157
That cost
$150 a piece.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.678
Oh, Jesus.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.432
Here I am in front
of half-naked women,

50:33.520 --> 50:34.873
I'm talking
about centerpieces.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.518
I think I left my
balls in the trunk.

50:36.600 --> 50:37.760
Dude, why are you
so stressed?

50:37.840 --> 50:40.195
'Cause I cannot afford
this wedding, y'all.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.838
But Ginger
just got a huge raise.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.434
So my wife has to pay
for her own wedding.

50:44.560 --> 50:46.232
That doesn't
sit right with me.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.629
Come on, man.
It's not like you have a choice.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.392
Ginger is who
we're talking about.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.440
She's gonna get the wedding she wants,
regardless.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.112
[phone vibrating]

50:54.880 --> 50:55.949
Speak of the devil.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.034
I should get goin'.

50:59.920 --> 51:02.832
Plus, it's not like having
a sugar mama's that bad.

51:02.920 --> 51:04.319
It's not like
you're a bum.

51:04.400 --> 51:06.038
I wouldn't mind
having a sugar mama.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.031
I think I'd be a good
stay-at-home dad.

51:08.120 --> 51:10.336
Well, it's not like you could
ever bring your children to work.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.395
Look at you.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.959
I mean, it could
be worse, right?

51:14.040 --> 51:16.634
I mean, you could be getting your
balls man-massaged tomorrow.

51:16.760 --> 51:17.760
What?
What?

51:20.240 --> 51:21.240
I said that
shit out loud?

51:21.320 --> 51:22.469
Yes.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.816
All right, look,
I promised Pressie

51:23.840 --> 51:25.216
I'd go with her
to the fertility clinic

51:25.240 --> 51:27.754
after she cried at the thought
of having sex with me again.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.909
Oh...

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Ouch.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.816
I'm sure everything's
gonna be all right, brother.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.431
I hope so.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.376
It's those Brazilian briefs
you've been wearing.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.196
Mmm-hmm.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.639
It cuts your circulation off.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.040
Your squirt game
is probably poor.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.111
There's nothin' wrong
with my squirt game, okay?

51:40.240 --> 51:41.856
And it's not the Brazilian briefs!
I knew it.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.552
Have you seen the
population in Brazil?

51:43.640 --> 51:46.552
His squirt game is terrible.
Shut the fuck up!

51:46.640 --> 51:48.039
Dude, I'm playin'.
Co-signed it.

51:49.360 --> 51:53.353
150 million!

51:53.440 --> 51:56.637
My sperm count's higher
than Robert Downey Jr.'s net worth!

51:56.720 --> 51:58.278
Bam!
[scoffs]

51:58.360 --> 51:59.839
You must be
very proud.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
I am very proud.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.479
I got the Michael Phelps
of sperm.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.913
They got little gold medals

52:04.000 --> 52:05.991
around their little sperm necks.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.149
Yeah.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.113
Why are you rubbing
this in my face?

52:09.200 --> 52:10.394
What?

52:10.880 --> 52:12.096
No, baby, I'm not rubbing
anything in your face.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.155
Oh, no, no?
No.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.400
Do you realize
that this means

52:14.440 --> 52:15.856
that there's something
wrong with me?

52:15.880 --> 52:17.074
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.639
I was talking
to my boys

52:18.720 --> 52:20.736
because they were making fun
of my Brazilian briefs.

52:20.760 --> 52:22.512
That's all.
I don't see your boys!

52:22.600 --> 52:24.079
You know what I see?

52:24.200 --> 52:26.475
I see this little
insensitive asshole

52:26.560 --> 52:28.560
who's gonna figure out
where he's sleeping tonight.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.153
Baby...
You think this is a game.

52:30.240 --> 52:31.616
I don't think this is a game.
Uh-uh.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.800
I think I just got 150 million
score on my sperm count.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.070
Callate!
Callate!

52:36.160 --> 52:37.513
Baby, l...

52:37.600 --> 52:39.158
Well, how am I supposed
to get home?

52:39.320 --> 52:40.976
You know how you're gonna get home?
With your super sperm.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.056
That's how you're
gonna get home.

52:42.080 --> 52:50.080
♫

53:26.280 --> 53:27.349
Hey, what's that?

53:27.440 --> 53:29.032
I didn't know
I was being watched.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.553
I thought we agreed
on no strings.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.358
No, you can't
open it yet.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.875
Why not?
'Cause it's a surprise for your birthday.

53:35.640 --> 53:36.640
Just wait on it.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.519
You didn't
have to do that.

53:40.240 --> 53:41.240
I know.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.871
Hmm.
What?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.120
Nothing.

53:46.920 --> 53:48.148
But I have an idea.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.273
It's gonna
have to wait.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.709
I'm not ready since the last round.
Mmm-mmm.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.469
I wanna shoot you.

53:54.880 --> 53:57.030
No, I don't think so.
Yes. Yes.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.896
There's this place
I've been wanting to shoot.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.592
It's in Venice
and it's beautiful.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.272
It's...
It's gritty...

54:02.840 --> 54:03.750
You'd be perfect.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.910
I don't want your thousands
of lnstagram followers

54:06.000 --> 54:07.115
looking at photos of me.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.634
I won't shoot your face
in a recognizable way.

54:09.720 --> 54:11.995
We'll make the whole
thing mysterious.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.080
One condition.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.195
[sighs]
I'm listening.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.276
Promise to get
your photographs published.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.797
People should pay
to see your work.

54:23.240 --> 54:24.559
You really think
that much of it?

54:24.640 --> 54:25.993
Yeah, it's that good.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.715
Okay.
Now can we shoot?

54:36.120 --> 54:38.839
[camera shutter clicking]

55:03.480 --> 55:05.198
We got it.
I'm happy.

55:05.720 --> 55:06.720
Next location.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.797
It's getting late,
and I have to work tomorrow.

55:44.760 --> 55:45.875
Work...

55:45.960 --> 55:48.633
I completely managed to
forget about work today.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.549
The whole day. Your job doesn't
seem to make you too happy.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.400
[sighs]
I don't know.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.879
I mean,
I'm great at it.

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
I make
a lot of money.

55:56.480 --> 55:57.480
It keeps
you humble.

55:58.160 --> 55:59.718
Well played.
Well played.

56:00.640 --> 56:01.696
I don't know.
I guess lately,

56:01.720 --> 56:03.736
it's just been a place
to collect a paycheck, you know.

56:03.760 --> 56:04.760
Mmm-hmm.

56:05.280 --> 56:06.679
And today...

56:06.760 --> 56:08.478
Today when
we were shooting...

56:09.560 --> 56:10.709
That was awesome.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.870
That was the most fun
I've had in a long time.

56:13.480 --> 56:14.480
That made
me happy.

56:15.600 --> 56:17.033
Maybe it's time
for a change.

56:17.960 --> 56:18.960
Maybe.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.320
Come in.

56:24.440 --> 56:27.477
I really have to go,
Charlie, I'm sorry.

56:28.120 --> 56:29.633
One last kiss?

56:30.480 --> 56:31.480
Just one.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.992
Okay,
one more after that.

56:35.480 --> 56:36.708
One more.
[laughs]

56:37.000 --> 56:38.672
One more.
[laughs]

56:46.280 --> 56:47.280
[clears throat]

56:47.360 --> 56:48.679
[both screaming]

56:48.800 --> 56:50.677
Sorry.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.153
Press kicked me out
for the night.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.240
[sighs]

56:53.320 --> 56:54.548
(Rick) I'm sorry.
He's rude.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.671
I'm Rick.
You must be mystery woman.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.388
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.152
Nice to meet
you, too.

57:00.240 --> 57:01.719
Rick was just leaving.
Charlie.

57:01.800 --> 57:04.473
No, I really gotta go.
No, you really don't.

57:04.560 --> 57:05.436
No, your
friend here

57:05.520 --> 57:06.816
looks like he needs
some boy time.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.513
I could totally use some boy time.
I'm just...

57:11.600 --> 57:12.669
You boys
have fun.

57:14.360 --> 57:15.588
It was a pleasure meeting you.

57:15.680 --> 57:16.874
Nice to meet you, too.

57:19.840 --> 57:20.840
Really?

57:20.920 --> 57:22.638
You gave me a key.

57:22.720 --> 57:23.800
That was like
two years ago,

57:23.880 --> 57:25.313
so you could
watch my iguana,

57:25.400 --> 57:26.799
which I haven't
seen since.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.433
You know, l...
I kinda feel like

57:29.600 --> 57:32.637
he's in the house somewhere still,
you know?

57:32.920 --> 57:34.717
She's fine. Wow!

57:35.760 --> 57:37.876
Holy shit, dude.

57:38.960 --> 57:40.473
Yeah.

57:40.600 --> 57:41.953
My man.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.109
Come on.

57:45.040 --> 57:46.155
Wow!

57:46.560 --> 57:47.675
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.751
I didn't mean
to stop the love train,

57:49.840 --> 57:51.239
But look,
Press kicked me out.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.794
She told Ginger
not to let me in.

57:53.880 --> 57:55.598
And so you were
my last option.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.830
You know there's such
things as hotels?

57:57.920 --> 57:58.960
But you got
all this space.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.114
All right, man.
What'd you do?

58:03.120 --> 58:04.348
I don't want
to talk about it.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.956
"The Michael
Phelps of sperm"?

58:12.920 --> 58:13.989
[sighs]

58:15.720 --> 58:16.789
Yeah, I said it,

58:16.920 --> 58:19.639
I might've got a little too excited.
I'd say so.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.029
This the last one.
All right.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.794
Pressie's worried that something
might be wrong with her.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.834
I told her she's overreacting,
but I don't know, man.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.114
End of the day,

58:30.200 --> 58:31.633
these things
always have a way

58:31.720 --> 58:33.056
of working themselves out,
you know?

58:33.080 --> 58:34.559
Mmm-hmm.
You guys are gonna be fine.

58:34.680 --> 58:36.636
Mmm-hmm.
You guys love each other, man.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.438
Holy shit.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.871
Charlie Mac just said something
positive about love.

58:49.280 --> 58:51.874
It's that badass chick,
isn't it?

58:51.960 --> 58:53.632
She's got you
good, huh?

58:54.640 --> 58:58.713
Maybe, it's the Tequila talking,
but maybe just a little bit.

58:58.800 --> 59:00.074
"Maybe a little bit," huh?

59:00.160 --> 59:01.479
I might have
to bring a plus one

59:01.560 --> 59:02.760
to Victor's wedding,
after all.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.896
See, that's
not a little bit,

59:03.920 --> 59:04.976
that's a lotta bit,
motherfucker.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.200
I knew it.
You don't lie to me.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.918
Lie to your girls,
not me, man.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.797
I knew it. I knew it.
You just like me.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.438
Before I say
something I regret,

59:11.520 --> 59:12.589
this is over,
this is done.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.154
All right.
Uh, clean this up, man.

59:15.480 --> 59:18.677
Yo, you trying to sweat this alcohol
out before the fitting tomorrow?

59:18.760 --> 59:20.273
I am not.
Yes, you are.

59:20.360 --> 59:22.237
I'm waking you up, man.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.355
Hey.

59:26.480 --> 59:27.993
I'm happy for you.

59:28.080 --> 59:30.799
It's just a girl, Rick.
It's just another girl.

59:31.440 --> 59:33.317
But I am
happy for you.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.356
Get it, get it, get it!
Fill 'em up.

59:39.440 --> 59:40.440
Enjoy.
Merci.

59:40.520 --> 59:41.555
Uh-huh.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.753
Enjoy.
To the family.

59:44.840 --> 59:45.955
[all]
To the family.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.156
Three amigos forever, right?
Mmm-hmm.

59:49.800 --> 59:52.712
You know what? It's good to see you
finally enjoying yourself, man.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.677
Hey, did I tell y'all
I got super sperm?

59:55.640 --> 59:56.516
'Cause I do.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.955
We're up in here
sipping expensive champagne,

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.270
trying on clothes
I can't pronounce.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.509
Shoot.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.640
So what if you gotta sell
your ass to pay for it.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.715
[all laughing]

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.176
But we livin'
the good life, right now.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.736
We livin' the good life.
This is good stuff.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.416
Shit. Look, you might be right
'bout selling ass

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.271
judging from the price
of this damn coat.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.679
Jesus.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.955
Hey, look, look,
at the end of the day,

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.871
as long as Ginger
gets the best man,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.951
'cause that's what
she deserves, right?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.080
Thank you,
Morris Chestnut.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.350
Are you gonna hold up this mirror?
All right.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.320
Hey, look. It's my wedding, okay?
Are you done?

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.856
Come on, I look good as hell
in this jacket.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.576
She might be gettin' the best man,
watch out now.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.953
Come on.
There's no room for you.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.176
Hey, uh, is there another
mirror around here?

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.110
Of course.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.031
Right there.
Thank you.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.696
...let us choose our own dresses.
I know...

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720
Ladies.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.675
That looks
so sexy on you.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.318
Your fiancee's
a lucky woman.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400
Congratulations.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.715
I am not getting married.
I'm the best man.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.472
Mmm, yes you are.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.798
[sales associate]
Ah, you look amazing.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.915
[woman]
Thank you.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.032
Oh, my God.
Eve, that is the dress.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.270
Please tell me,
you know that's the dress.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.998
Oh, it looks beautiful.
It's perfect.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.752
Oh, I can't even
talk anymore...

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120
I love it.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.877
See? This guy can't even
keep his eyes off of you.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.598
Isn't she gorgeous?

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.519
Yeah.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.112
You look beautiful.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.795
Thank you.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.348
Yo, I heard there was
fine-ass females...

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.828
Oh, shit.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280
Yo.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.269
Um, hi.
I'm Rick.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.879
Yo, I'm out, man.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280
Yo.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.714
Sir? Sir?

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.835
The jacket.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.315
Yo.
What's going on?

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.595
You gotta
check this out.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.194
Merde, alors.
This is America?

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.715
All right.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.156
You get a five-star rating, buddy,
five-star rating, man.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.992
We gotta do this
again, sometime.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.308
Hey!

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.393
I know you.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.993
I'm sorry
I left so soon.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.656
I didn't get to congratulate you,
earlier.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.908
Charlie, don't.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.036
No, I'm serious,
congratulations.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.394
Congratulations.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.277
You make for
a beautiful bride.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.793
He's a lucky,
lucky guy.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.476
Does he know that you're
still fucking other men?

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.709
Stop it, Charlie!

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.074
Stop what?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.434
Asking logical questions?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.953
I mean, clearly,
I should've asked

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.598
a couple more
from the start, right?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.671
No strings.
That's what we said.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.200
You knew what you
were getting into.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.714
No, you knew what I
was getting into.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.791
It's so easy
to say "no strings"

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.791
when you're already
attached to someone else.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.996
I wasn't attached.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.990
So I'm your
rebound guy,

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.910
is that
what I am to you?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.752
Men can bounce around
from woman to woman,

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.115
but if I do it,
I'm a bad person.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.236
That's not fair.
What's not fair

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.112
is the fact that
I'm standing here

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.792
looking like
an asshole,

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.631
in love with a girl
that I can't have.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.631
We have a connection,

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.475
but what we did
isn't love, it's fun.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.834
This is love.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.399
Why not give
us a chance?

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.550
Lust is easy, Charlie.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.511
Love is complicated.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.552
It's not that
complicated.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.717
I know how I feel,
when I look at you.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.758
I'm getting married,
Charlie, and that's not gonna change.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.751
Then why are
you even here?

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.273
Because I wanted
to check on you.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.998
I don't need you
to check on me!

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.435
Uber got my back.
I'm fine.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.879
Adios, Eva.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.354
[sighs]

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.634
Where the hell is he?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.035
Hey, Kareem.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.591
Yes, sir?
We're waiting, like, 20 minutes.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.511
Does Charlie know
the meeting time?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.751
Uh, yes, sir, he does.
Let me check his work cell again.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.191
You know what?
Let me check on him.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.080
Good idea.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.591
Where are we?
Well...

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.240
We're on time,
and growing impatient.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.840
You guys could have
started without me.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.755
No, we actually couldn't.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.840
(Marty)
Look, Charlie,

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.555
I know you have some
reservations about this deal,

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.471
but we need you
to get behind this,

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.959
we need to lock in
the tour dates,

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.871
we need you...
Look, I'm on board.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.116
What? Really?
Give me the paperwork.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.918
I'll have him sign it.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.629
Good talk.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.308
[all]
Surprise!

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.552
Happy birthday!

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.430
Happy birthday!

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.034
Congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.479
Okay.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560
I going to lay down,

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.074
and I'd be pleasantly surprised
if y'all got the fuck out.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.192
(Victor)
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.349
You need
to chill, man.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.350
What is
your problem?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.908
Look, I had a long day
at work, okay?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.355
I'm tired, I'm good.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.634
Thank you, all right?

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.433
Look, we went through
a lot of trouble for you, bro.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.193
Yo, we're not 10 years old,
bro.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.376
Look, why don't you go through this
much trouble at work,

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.600
so you don't feel
like a bitch,

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.280
'cause your girl make
more money than you.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.354
Wow.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.869
You need to check yourself.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.109
I need to check myself?

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.480
Yeah, you need
to check yourself.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.748
I need to check
myself, Rick?

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.880
Well, why don't you start
by checking yourself, huh?

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.320
Why don't you start
with your girl?

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.152
Why don't you tell her
how you really feel?

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.232
We all know that having a family
is a deal breaker for you.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.880
You want to have kids.
Your girl can't get pregnant.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.951
Dude,
what the fuck are you...

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.359
Yeah, seriously.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.472
It's okay.
No.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.039
What the fuck
is your problem?

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.599
What the fuck is my...

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320
You're just
miserable.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.913
What the fuck is my problem,
Press?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.149
My fucking
problem is

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.754
everybody acts like their
life is so perfect.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.152
Everybody's
fucking perfect

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.071
but me,
but Charlie.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.752
Kareem, get the hell
out of here.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.671
Get the fuck out!
Why are you even here?

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.239
Yo, are you serious,
right now?

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.833
Am I serious?

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.359
Am I serious?

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.199
Guys, listen, man.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.673
We don't have
to do this, man.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.228
Why don't you take
your ass, go home,

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.753
and let me
be alone, okay?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.115
[scoffs]

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.838
Why you gotta be
such an asshole, man?

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.354
No, no, he's not
being an asshole.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.192
He just wants
to be alone.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280
[scoffs]

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.389
You know what?

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.200
It's so crazy because you
do that so well, Charlie.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.156
What's that?

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.832
Be alone.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.796
Let us know
how that works out for you.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.136
(Charlie) Thank you, Ginger.
(Ginger) You need to grow up.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.229
(Charlie)
Okay.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.358
Sad.
Sad?

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.829
Victor, you got shoes on
in my crib, man.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.717
You got shoes on,
motherfucker.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.074
You guys
know my rules!

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.434
I got rules!

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960
[exhales]

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.678
I thought
I'd find you here.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.198
What the hell
happened last night?

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.832
You know what
happened last night.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.560
I'm sure they told you,
so you can go back

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.312
and tell them I'm fine,
all right?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.440
Yeah, you don't seem fine.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.589
I'm fine.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.557
I'm not letting
you off that easy.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640
What is this, therapy?

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.953
I'm here because
I love you.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:18.674
Talk to me,
what happened?

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.318
I called some people
out on their shit.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:21.310
That's what
happened.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:22.719
What? Why?

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.536
Why should you be calling
anyone out on their shit,

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.200
unless you're willing
to look at yourself?

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.750
Sounds to me like you
were lashing out.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.671
Come on, you had
your heart broken.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.636
It's okay.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.118
You're gonna
go through some pain.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.349
She used me.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.917
She fuckin' used me,
Sherry.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:40.118
I'm never
doing that again.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.474
How many women
have you used?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.035
Don't do that.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.348
Karma's a bitch,
isn't it?

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.111
Look, I'm gonna keep it
real with you.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.394
You set yourself up
for this.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.839
Did you learn this
on your first

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.751
or your second marriage,
Sherry?

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.274
Or any of your failed
relationships, huh?

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.627
You're such
a great therapist,

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.160
but how come
you can't figure it out?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.156
I learned this when
our mom and dad died.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:01.917
What the fuck...

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.991
What do they have to do with this?
Everything.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.559
No.
Yes.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.240
You don't think
Mom and Dad's death

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.759
has anything
to do with the fact

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.071
that you're afraid of losing your
friends to their relationships?

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.832
That you're scared of
committing to one of your own?

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.109
You've never dealt
with Mom and Dad's death.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:21.033
You will never go with me
to visit their grave.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120
Why?

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.675
You're gonna really
push me away?

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.895
I guess you're gonna have to
figure this one out on your own.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.988
I guess so.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.071
Well, I'll be sending you
love and light.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.274
From afar.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:37.549
Very far.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.433
[Julius chattering]

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.988
(Marty) To French Montana
and this deal.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.988
Ah, yes.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.194
I am pigs-in-shit excited

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.157
about having
you being a part

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.798
of the P.E.A. family.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.435
A new member.
Yeah!

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.115
And I would be remiss if I didn't thank
the agent that brokered this deal,

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.351
my personal Pit Bull.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.791
Charlie Motherfuckin' Mac.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
[all cheering]

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.079
Not only do you have the vision
to make it in our business,

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.038
you have the
cojones to last.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.156
French, you ain't gotta
worry about nothin'.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.515
Let's celebrate, Julius...

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.033
Let's celebrate.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.548
French,
don't sign that, man.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.635
What? Why not?
[Marty laughs]

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.835
What a kidder.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.319
It's not
the right deal for you.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.391
(Marty)
Charlie, shut up.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.233
Hey, you wanna be
a big star, right?

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.355
Of course.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.396
Then, don't listen to him
and sign the deal.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.633
Man, what the fuck
is going on, man?

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.312
You been kissing
his ass all day,

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.994
all this sappy shit about how he's the man,
praisin' him.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.719
Now all of the sudden you're telling me,
don't sign the contact.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.233
What the fuck
is going on, man?

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.072
No, no, no.
I wasn't kissing his ass.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.832
I was blowing smoke.
There's a difference.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.070
What'd you think about this shit, Julius?
[chattering]

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.628
Look, French, even Julius can tell,
this is not right.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.234
Look, you won't make nearly
as much money on this tour,

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.510
as you would on the one
we didn't tell you about.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.433
Drake's people called. They wanted
to go out on the road with you.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.880
What?
I should have told you, man.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.678
Charlie, what are you,
illin', yo?

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.432
Let's keep it 100%.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.229
I mean, this is youth
and inexperience talking here.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.072
He's all about the money,
right now.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.593
I'm talking
about a legacy.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.272
You can't put
a price tag on

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.588
the exposure
that you'll get

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.716
headlining
your own tour.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.034
Marty, shut up!

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.075
Stop it.
Stop lying.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.799
French, the only reason we're
trying to push you into this deal

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.836
is because it benefits
Premiere Edge.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.118
Don't sign.
All right, that's it.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.350
You know, shut up.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.555
Security!

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.474
You're fired.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.710
That was
the whole point.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800
Good luck, French.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.629
Good talk.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.591
I'll live in his house for the rest
of my goddamn life if I have to,

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.911
but I am through
with this marriage!

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.918
[automated voice] Retina scan required
to dial this number.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920
Scan failed.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.357
Unable to dial, post, or text.
[sighs]

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.432
Look at this.
Why's it flippin' out like that?

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.839
Side-boob on fleek.
Look at this.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.751
Stupid!
Charlie, look at this.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.269
Oh, my God.
He's so lame, right now.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.114
Hey.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640
Hey!

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240
[exhales]

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.029
Wow, that is
such a waste.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.313
[scoffs]

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.879
Wow.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:11.960
♫

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.353
[Charlie exhales]

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.874
[chuckles]

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.311
So what's going on,
Charlie, huh?

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.511
I wanted to apologize.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.636
You know,
I was a real jerk.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.233
On my birthday,
and after.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.038
I understand.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.390
But yeah, you were.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.914
Okay, you're really not gonna
make this easy for me, are you?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.116
It's not supposed
to be easy.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.838
Especially within
these four walls.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.356
All right, well, I'm sorry.
Okay?

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.274
Well, hold on a second.
Sit down.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.275
What exactly
are you sorry for?

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.075
I'm sorry that I hurt

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.593
and pushed away

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.109
everybody in my life
that means something to me.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.231
Keep it coming.
And I'm sorry

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.594
that our parents died.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.238
All right, let's dig in,
okay?

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.230
Let's go deeper
with this.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.833
What are we doing?
Therapy?

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.593
Well, no, I'm your sister.
That would be illegal,

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.955
but we're talking
and I'm a therapist.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.632
And let's not
get off track.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.278
We've got some
momentum going here.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360
What are you
grateful for?

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.073
What I'm grateful for?
Yes.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.637
I'm grateful that I am
finally learning to grow up.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.235
And I'm grateful I have
some awesome friends.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.832
And I don't know
if I've ever said it,

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.313
but I'm grateful
for you.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.153
Aw, Charlie.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.837
I am so proud of you.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.557
That'll be $300.
No, seriously.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.376
I think you'll feel
better if you pay for it.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400
I've already
had lunch.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:34.152
You're...
Stop. Stop.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.840
Come here. You're taking advantage
of my vulnerability right now.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.030
All right?
Look.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.477
You were pretty young
when Mom and Dad died,

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.551
but they had
a great marriage.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.150
I got to see that,
but you really didn't.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.918
I think that's probably
why I believe in love,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.319
and why you don't.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.475
You're good.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.959
But I have
to tell you something.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.397
Do you know
what makes me happy?

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.550
It makes me happy that you
had your heart broken.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.551
What?
Why would you say that?

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.279
It means you had
the capacity to love.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.272
And that, my little brother,
is a beautiful thing.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.711
All right,
now that we're good,

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.995
I gotta patch things
up with the crew.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.976
I don't even know if I'm still
invited to the wedding.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.040
Just 'cause
you were a jerk

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.798
doesn't mean
they don't still love you.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.072
Okay, everybody!
Everybody, back to one!

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.957
Come on,
let's go, flower girl.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.678
Let's go,
ring bearer.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.399
Bridesmaids, groomsmen,
everybody, let's go.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.879
Back to your
starting positions.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.110
We're gonna run this
one more time.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.056
Somebody tell this chick
this isn't brain surgery.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.470
Walking down the aisle.
Left, right, left, right...

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.153
Smile.
I think we got it.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.476
Hey, bud.
Yeah, okay.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.475
Hey, Press.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.679
Any room
for another best man?

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.080
I'm sorry, Rick.
So, he's the best man, now?

01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.912
(Geneva) Okay, come on.
Come on, people.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.513
Come on, come on,
let's go.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.591
Bridesmaid,
with the best man.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.517
Don't look at me.
There you go, there you go.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.511
Okay, and when they get
halfway down the aisle,

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.591
the rest of the wedding party begins.
There you...

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.951
Okay, slowly, slowly, slowly.
And smile.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.598
Smile.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.511
Okay, that's nice.
Let's go.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.616
Look, man, I'm sorry
about everything...

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.471
Hey, you don't even
gotta say it, man.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.597
Okay, excuse me. You two can
deal with your bromance issues

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.999
on your own time,
all right?

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.514
This is a wedding, okay?
I need you to focus.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.950
All right? Just...
Just focus.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040
All right?
Focus.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.160
Yeah.
Who is that?

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.656
(Victor) I don't know, but apparently
she's high as hell on cocaine.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.680
Bride!

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.794
Ah! About time,
you little jerk.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.189
Ow.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.954
I deserve that.
Mmm-hmm.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.040
I'm sorry.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.233
All right, just come on.
Come on.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.112
Oh, okay.
All right, come on, come on.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.200
Handsy!

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.398
I just want everybody
to remember,

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.710
a wedding is
a magical moment

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.148
that every bride
should cherish

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.631
as she goes through
those long, hard, trying,

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.037
seemingly insurmountable,
Mount-Everest-like years that lie ahead.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.274
This is the day
that will comfort her

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.715
as she weathers
the storms to come.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.631
Okay?
So, come on, people,

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.755
just stop playing around

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.479
and let's get it
together, all right?

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.073
Pastor, commence.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.516
It's straight.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.273
Hey.
Hey.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.677
So, am I still getting the
silent treatment from you?

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.239
I don't know,
I haven't decided yet.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.709
What can I do to speed this up?
Please.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.272
Maybe you can
start off with some

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.193
free babysitting.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.155
Yo, I told you.
Super sperm.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.194
Congratulations.
Congrats.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.716
It is about time,
but didn't you just pee on that?

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.472
Why is it
on the table?

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.437
That is just nasty.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.558
You're not going to be able
to fit into your dress.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.232
All calories count.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.111
(Pastor)
By the power vested in me,

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.236
from the state
of California,

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.871
as a servant of God,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.076
You may kiss
the bride.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.629
[applause]

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.475
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.870
I present to you,
Victor and Ginger.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.116
[all cheering]

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.228
♫

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.195
You always hear people talk
about fairy-tale weddings,

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.877
but you never really hear people
talk about fairy-tale love.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.757
And that's what
we're witnessing.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:08.719
That's what I've been witnessing
for the past what, 20 years?

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.675
Yeah.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.194
'Cause where else
other than a storybook

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.749
would a 10-year-old boy

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.478
with dashing,
handsome looks...

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.709
Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.358
Meet a beautiful princess,

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.838
fall in love,

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.399
and never have eyes
for anyone else?

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.595
I love you.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.954
(Charlie)
He never did.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.056
Good.
And I'm a bad influence...

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.196
He's terrible.
He's terrible.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.313
(Charlie)
A good friend told me

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.517
that there's nothing
more important in life

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.158
than going after
what you love,

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.995
or in this case,
who you love.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.870
And while there might not be
any perfect people, guys,

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.715
there are people that are
perfect for each other.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.719
And trust me,

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.438
Ginger and Victor,

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.637
you two are
my best friends.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.869
[all]
Aw.

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.159
You guys are my...

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.355
[clears throat]

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.759
You guys
are my family.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.350
And I just...
I hope that tomorrow

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.711
brings you more
happiness and more joy,

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.676
than any of us
could have ever imagined.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.913
I'm just happy that l...

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.951
that we were here
to witness it.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.237
Guys, lift your glasses.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.510
To Victor
and to Ginger,

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.192
the perfect match.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.998
[all]
The perfect match!

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.270
[people chatting]

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.296
I feel like I could have
taken some of these.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320
I highly doubt that.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.336
You see,
it's a little different than shooting porn.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.588
One time
in college, man.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.830
"One time."
One time in college!

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.715
Look at him.
Look at him.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.416
His parents would be
so proud of all of this.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:55.556
Charlie, I love this.
Where'd you shoot it?

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.816
(Charlie)
I shot that one in...

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.831
I know they are proud.
I mean, we're proud.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.176
You know,
it took him a lot to get here.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.668
Real talk,
this is impressive for a first gallery.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.840
Yo!

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.037
Yeah, dawg.
That's my man!

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.678
Looks like you've got
a dress shirt on.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.552
Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.550
Thank you
so much for coming.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.198
Hey, how's it
going tonight?

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.720
You know, it's been
a tough journey,

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.074
but nights like tonight

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.752
let me know I made
the right choice.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.274
God is good.
Yes, he is.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.998
Yo, yo,
yo, yo, look!

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.720
(Rick) Dude, act like you've seen
a celebrity before.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.552
(Victor) I'm just saying,
but it's...

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.551
I'll be right back, guys.
Thanks again.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.517
French!
What's up, my bro?

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.874
What up, baby?
What's goin' on?

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.075
Congratulations, man.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.151
Ah, thank you.
I had no idea you were coming.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:43.696
Man, look, as soon
as I heard about it, man,

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.376
I had to come through,
you know what I'm saying,

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.776
and support my guy, man.
Thank you, man.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.710
And I wanted
to tell you,

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.678
I appreciated you, man,
for that wack-ass deal at Premier Edge.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760
Yeah.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.637
That was real honest of you,
man. You know?

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.156
Yeah, I'm so sorry I got you
caught up with them to begin with.

01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.240
How'd you
hear about this?

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.920
I got my ears to the streets, man.
Come on, man.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.718
No, my agent put me on.
Who you with now?

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.438
Actually, man,
them dude's right there.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.678
Abram and Kareem.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.069
Hey, man.

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.277
(French Montana)
Welcome the whole team back.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.429
Yeah, man.

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.736
You know, I was hating how Marty
was doing that Premiere Edge,

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.990
so I left shortly
after you did,

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.496
on some Jerry Maguire
type shit, right?

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.856
So, I guess that made
me Cuba Gooding, Jr.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.279
You know
what I'm saying?

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.511
What, is that Sevyn Streeter?
Oh, shit.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.717
But we doing real good, man. You know,
a lot of good things are happening.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.189
A lot of sponsorships.
You know what I'm saying?

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.918
Chico,
bring the cash.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
Okay.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.676
Oh, oh.
Well, all right.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.398
So, like I was
saying, you know.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.456
You know, we could always use
somebody like you

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.595
back home,
man, you know?

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.989
With the agency definitely, you know,
we need you back.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.470
No more agency life for me.
I'm at home right here.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.630
What?
Hmm.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.514
Hannghh.
Hannghh.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.669
You still
don't got it.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.274
But you
know what?

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.316
Bring me
your most expensive one.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.720
It's the least
I could do for you.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.988
Consider it done.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.759
Congrats, my brother.
I'm really proud of you. Love, G.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.796
Remember one thing, man.
Stay black.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.952
I don't know what else I would do,
but thank you.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.993
I don't remember receiving
payment for the use of my image.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.270
It's good to see you.
You, too.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.510
You look good.
So do you.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.115
This is amazing, Charlie.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.599
It's been quite
the journey.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.675
(Eva)
I can imagine.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.630
You know, I never got
to thank you for that camera.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.233
Did you get
a chance to use it?

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.437
Look around.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120
Wow.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.313
So, how's
married life?

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.391
It's different.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.073
Challenging.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.479
Wonderful.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.557
Eva, why are you here?

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.870
Believe it or not,
I heard about this from my husband.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.949
He's an art dealer, and he told
me about this amazing exhibit.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.713
And it turns out
it was yours.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.151
That's crazy.
Yeah.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.989
You know, I'm really sorry
for the way things ended with us.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.559
Me, too.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.834
But I want
to explain myself.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.816
You don't got... Because I feel
like you deserve...

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.432
Eve, you don't
have to explain.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.752
Look, our lives
were completely opposite.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.398
I was with
the same man, Kevin,

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.833
since I was in high school.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.673
But when it was time
to get married, he got cold feet

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.274
and I decided
to test the waters

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.120
with you.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.508
I'm glad
I did what I did.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.111
And I don't regret it.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.838
I'm just really sorry
that I hurt you.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.399
You don't have
to apologize.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.794
You know, for the first time
since my parents died,

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.393
I actually felt something.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.756
I actually
allowed myself

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.715
to feel something.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.036
That never would have
happened without you.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.272
Goodbye, Charlie.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.078
Don't forget to
send me that check.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.560
[Eva chuckles]

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:54.680
[exhales]

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.077
Look, Keish and Jackie
will do hair and makeup.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.434
It'll be fine.
All right?

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.554
Yeah, Abram,
just make sure Kim's on time.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.391
All right, I got you, man.
Later.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.711
Got an apple-beet-carrot-ginger-volcano.
Extra ginger.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.271
Thank you, Nate.
You're welcome.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.318
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't think that one is yours.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.910
Apple-beet-carrot-ginger-volcano,
with extra ginger.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:17.671
Charlie.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.035
Oh, wait.
Charlie?

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.318
Dana.
You're Ginger's friend.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.992
Right.
Right.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.275
Good to see you. How's Ginger?
Have you talked to her?

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.715
She's great.
She's really happy.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:29.936
Did I miss you
at the wedding?

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.160
Yeah, I was
out of the country,

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.156
and I just got back
two days ago.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.468
I was so bummed
I missed it.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.709
But how was
the wedding?

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.036
Well, the best man's speech
was awesome.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.350
Are...
Hey, are you with anyone?

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.440
No.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.109
You wanna sit?
And chill?

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.150
Out of the country,
where'd you go?

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.673
Oh, I went to Dubai.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.159
Dubai.
Yeah.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.115
You still don't have
any deal breakers, huh?

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.114
Me?
Yeah.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.357
Do you still have
all of your rules?

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.670
I got rid of the rules
a long time ago.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.199
Cheers. Cheers,
good to see you.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.793
It's good
to see you, too.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.831
It's funny, after dinner that time,
I thought of you.

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:08.718
Did you?
Yeah, your smile.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.157
You got one of those
light-up-the-room type of smiles.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:21.240
♫

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.431
I'm out here doing
man shit, all right?

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.278
Back up.
You gonna make me?

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.110
Oh, I'll make you.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.076
How you gonna do that?

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.096
I'm gonna man handle you.
That's what I'm gonna do with you.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.280
Guys,
I'm standing right here.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.600
I'm right here
in front of you.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.834
You wanna join?

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.400
(Rick)
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.776
That's nice.
That's nice right there.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.392
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Yes?

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.356
You got Hermes?

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.830
What? I didn't say, "Herpes."
I said, "Hermes."

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.791
Hermes, Hermes.
Yes.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.716
[chattering]

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.916
My man.
Hey, you owe me.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.479
I got you.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.696
I will see
you gentlemen later.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.836
I am off to get
a stress release massage,

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:57.920
if you know
what I mean.

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.471
She knows
what I mean.

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:11.837
You shouldn't text
and walk, Charlie.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.633
You have an obstacle course
in your office, Sherry.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.596
What is this
doing here?

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.671
This is a great object
of design.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.439
In fact, it makes my clients feel
very comfortable and relaxed

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.159
because it feels
like nothing ever ends.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.151
Circles are good.
They would be good for you.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.593
I don't feel
comfortable.

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.194
I don't feel at all warm,
fuzzy...

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.076
[bridesmaid]
Isn't she gorgeous?

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.832
[all laughing]
