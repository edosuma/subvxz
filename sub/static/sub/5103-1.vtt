01:02.409 --> 01:05.007
Dad,
what's happening?

01:05.212 --> 01:06.645
Nick, listen to me like we're

01:06.747 --> 01:09.045
the last two people
on the planet. Okay? Nick,

01:10.016 --> 01:13.315
Some day a girl
is going to give you a flower.

01:14.287 --> 01:15.652
You got that? A flower.

01:15.722 --> 01:17.246
And you have to help her.

01:17.357 --> 01:19.291
You help her and you help us all.

01:19.793 --> 01:21.385
Okay?

01:22.896 --> 01:25.091
I know it doesn't make
any sense right now,

01:25.198 --> 01:27.325
but I believe the woman
who told me that.

01:28.034 --> 01:29.763
You think you could believe me?

01:31.772 --> 01:33.330
I love you.

01:38.011 --> 01:40.002
I always said you were special, Nick.

01:40.113 --> 01:41.603
Turns out I was right.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.521
Division's here.
Just keep moving.

01:53.593 --> 01:56.323
And don't make any decisions
that any watcher can track.

02:40.373 --> 02:42.341
I just wanted to have a conversation.

03:04.664 --> 03:06.154
What a waste.

03:07.801 --> 03:09.428
Bring his body to the lab.

03:15.709 --> 03:17.768
There are special people in this world.

03:18.478 --> 03:20.309
We don't ask to be special.

03:20.847 --> 03:22.576
We're just born this way.

03:27.087 --> 03:29.487
We pass you on the streets every day,

03:30.423 --> 03:32.254
unnoticed by most.

03:41.801 --> 03:43.826
It started in 1945.

03:44.504 --> 03:47.769
The Nazis were conducting
experiments in psychic warfare...

03:48.508 --> 03:52.035
trying to turn those
with psychic abilities into soldiers.

03:54.114 --> 03:55.604
Lots of us died.

03:55.715 --> 03:56.943
The war ended,

03:57.250 --> 03:59.218
but the experiments never stopped.

03:59.886 --> 04:01.547
Other governments around the world

04:01.688 --> 04:03.952
set up what they called "Divisions"...

04:07.193 --> 04:09.491
trying to do what the Nazis couldn't,

04:09.596 --> 04:11.188
to turn us into weapons.

04:11.398 --> 04:15.528
Division's agents are trained to track
and hunt us down like animals...

04:15.635 --> 04:17.966
take us away from our families
and friends.

04:18.904 --> 04:21.601
There are children stuffed away
all over the world.

04:21.841 --> 04:24.241
They test us and categorize us.

04:24.544 --> 04:26.375
I'm what they call a "watcher".

04:26.513 --> 04:27.775
We can see the future,

04:27.847 --> 04:29.974
even if that's not always
as simple as it sounds.

04:30.050 --> 04:33.918
The jumbo jet crashed.
There are no reports of survivors.

04:33.987 --> 04:35.477
Others are called "movers",

04:35.855 --> 04:37.982
just an easy way
of saying "telekinetic".

04:43.196 --> 04:45.130
"Pushers" put thoughts in your head

04:45.231 --> 04:47.563
and make whatever lie
they come up with the truth.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.158
They'd already begun
to control my mind...

04:55.442 --> 04:57.774
"Sniffs", "shifters", "shadows",

04:57.844 --> 05:00.312
"bleeders", it goes on and on.

05:01.548 --> 05:03.948
In Division's eyes,
we're all just lab rats.

05:05.118 --> 05:08.554
Only one problem: we keep dying.

05:08.655 --> 05:12.716
The evidence shows that the kids
were given milk with radioactive iodine.

05:12.792 --> 05:16.057
No one has ever survived
the drug meant to boost our powers.

05:16.496 --> 05:17.929
My name is Cassie Holmes.

05:18.565 --> 05:20.157
Division took my mom from me.

05:20.433 --> 05:23.197
Right now the future
I see doesn't look so great.

05:23.269 --> 05:26.261
The good news is the future
is always changing...

05:26.606 --> 05:30.303
in the largest of ways
by the smallest of things.

05:31.211 --> 05:33.042
They've been winning a lot of battles.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.914
Now it's our turn to win the war.

05:38.351 --> 05:40.148
"TODAY"

05:42.922 --> 05:44.549
"DIVISION LAB"

07:14.614 --> 07:16.275
She survived the injection.

07:17.851 --> 07:20.945
She's our patient zero.
Bring me every sniffer we have.

07:21.054 --> 07:23.147
But she's on foot.
She can't get far.

07:25.158 --> 07:27.683
She'll get help from anyone
she can lay her eyes on.

07:31.197 --> 07:34.724
Do whatever is necessary to get her
and that syringe back! Now!!

07:37.771 --> 07:40.865
"2 DAYS FROM NOW"

09:20.874 --> 09:25.868
You're already down five thousand
I hear you owe more than that to Chen.

09:27.313 --> 09:28.337
Chen's a liar...

09:28.414 --> 09:31.281
Am I a liar too? I was told...

09:31.384 --> 09:33.215
you owe fifteen

09:33.319 --> 09:35.514
So you want to bet or not?

09:36.222 --> 09:38.156
Ok. But if you lose again...

09:38.291 --> 09:39.724
I'll have you beaten.

10:18.798 --> 10:21.926
You owe us six thousand, Nick!

10:58.371 --> 10:59.668
What do you say, Nick?

11:01.407 --> 11:02.203
Who are you?

11:02.308 --> 11:04.242
- We're with Division.
- Like you didn't know.

11:05.411 --> 11:06.612
- Go to hell.
- Easy, son.

11:06.612 --> 11:08.580
If we wanted you,
you'd be in the back of a van.

11:08.648 --> 11:10.946
You gonna let us in
or are we gonna have to be rude?

11:14.654 --> 11:16.849
Smart move living
in a shithole like this.

11:17.523 --> 11:20.287
One on top of the other.
Took you far off the radar.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.588
Not far enough.

11:25.164 --> 11:26.756
Would you believe
this is how we found you?

11:26.833 --> 11:29.802
From your old toothbrush
from that encounter ten years ago.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.233
Barely a scent left.

11:36.042 --> 11:37.441
Thought you were in Tokyo.

11:40.213 --> 11:41.441
Then Malaysia.

11:50.656 --> 11:53.887
Finally we got a few readings
on some buildings.

12:03.002 --> 12:07.132
There's a lot of runaway psychics
in Hong Kong trying to disappear. Nick.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.609
People with no country, no loyalty...

12:10.710 --> 12:13.577
No desire to get involved
in political bullshit.

12:29.829 --> 12:32.093
Nobody but you in this apartment
for a long time, Nick.

12:32.198 --> 12:33.927
Why? You looking
for someone besides me?

12:34.467 --> 12:37.436
A girl. She has something
belonging to us.

12:38.237 --> 12:39.761
Better than a hunch you know her.

12:42.608 --> 12:44.166
Obviously I don't.

12:48.948 --> 12:50.848
In case we need to get hold
of you again.

12:50.950 --> 12:53.612
I've got some old toilet paper
you boys might like more.

12:54.187 --> 12:55.814
Don't bother running.

12:57.190 --> 12:58.680
We know where you are now.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.301
Shit.

13:34.794 --> 13:36.159
- Yeah?
- Hey, Nick.

13:36.496 --> 13:38.225
- Who is this?
- Open up, Nick.

13:38.865 --> 13:40.560
And put your gun down.

13:54.113 --> 13:57.105
Put that thing away.
Got you something.

13:58.885 --> 14:01.353
Where's the chicken? There it is.

14:03.990 --> 14:06.584
Hey, whoa! Excuse me?

14:07.593 --> 14:08.958
Is this how you treat your guests?

14:09.028 --> 14:13.021
This is how I treat random strangers
who barge into my apartment.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.327
Like the Division sniffers
who were just here?

14:16.335 --> 14:17.324
Who are you?

14:18.304 --> 14:19.771
I'm Cassie.

14:21.007 --> 14:22.338
I'm here to help you.

14:24.610 --> 14:25.975
Listen, Cassie...

14:26.045 --> 14:28.980
I'm sure your mom and dad are nervous
about you right now, so why don't you...

14:29.715 --> 14:31.649
- You don't understand.
- You've got that right.

14:32.585 --> 14:34.951
This is about us
finding six million dollars.

14:37.890 --> 14:39.084
That's us.

14:40.927 --> 14:42.292
And that's our money.

14:44.764 --> 14:46.356
And that's my toothbrush.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.127
You're a watcher.

14:49.936 --> 14:52.166
So is there a place we can
get something to eat besides chicken?

14:55.608 --> 14:56.768
I'm buying.

15:10.990 --> 15:12.480
Lose a bet with your hairdresser?

15:13.226 --> 15:14.454
I like color.

15:57.703 --> 16:00.934
First things first. I know you're
a second-generation mover.

16:01.007 --> 16:02.565
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

16:02.642 --> 16:03.973
I'll let you know when I see one.

16:04.610 --> 16:05.577
You don't really use your powers,

16:05.645 --> 16:07.408
which means you haven't practiced
and you kind of suck at it.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.970
- How am I doing so far?
- Go on.

16:09.048 --> 16:10.174
I'm a watcher.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.641
Second generation, like you.

16:12.752 --> 16:14.617
- Wow. That's.
- Complicated.

16:14.954 --> 16:16.945
Because the future can change
just by talking about it.

16:17.056 --> 16:18.683
So I see glimpses
and I draw in my book.

16:18.791 --> 16:20.281
But I'm not really good at it.

16:20.359 --> 16:22.054
I'm kind of a crappy artist, but...

16:22.595 --> 16:24.119
I'm sure you already knew that.

16:26.265 --> 16:28.028
But I got the sniffs
in your apartment, right?

16:28.334 --> 16:29.892
That's why I brought you
a new toothbrush.

16:31.604 --> 16:32.764
Anything with shrimp.

16:33.806 --> 16:35.000
You speak Chinese?

16:35.274 --> 16:37.970
Cantonese.
I'm surprised you didn't know that,

16:38.210 --> 16:39.302
being a watcher.

16:39.445 --> 16:41.174
I get things wrong sometimes.

16:41.447 --> 16:42.471
I know the feeling.

16:45.451 --> 16:47.351
Are you worried about
the thugs you owe money to?

16:48.354 --> 16:50.015
Don't. Thank you.

16:50.156 --> 16:51.953
We'll be able to take care
of it in a couple days.

16:53.559 --> 16:55.550
With your six million dollars.

16:56.629 --> 16:58.563
- Where's the money?
- It's on its way here.

16:59.598 --> 17:00.690
With a girl.

17:02.034 --> 17:03.023
Don't tell me.

17:03.169 --> 17:05.160
Same girl Division sniffs are looking for.

17:08.773 --> 17:10.207
It's Cassie, right?

17:11.042 --> 17:12.407
Enjoy your food.

17:13.311 --> 17:14.711
- That's it?
- That's it.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.441
Sorry. Some 12-year old that knew
I needed a new toothbrush...

17:17.550 --> 17:19.279
isn't enough to get me
involved with Division.

17:19.385 --> 17:20.682
Even if it's not a con.

17:22.588 --> 17:25.954
I'm 13. And I've been
told I look at least 14.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.083
- Right.
- And this is not a con.

17:28.194 --> 17:30.662
This is a way for everyone
to get something they want.

17:30.763 --> 17:32.321
I've actually used that line before.

17:32.598 --> 17:35.089
Fine. Don't believe me.

17:36.435 --> 17:38.369
- But you will help me.
- Really?

17:38.471 --> 17:40.063
Because I'm getting a message.

17:40.206 --> 17:42.868
It's telling me "find somebody else".

17:45.111 --> 17:46.806
If we don't find the case and that girl,

17:46.912 --> 17:48.709
really bad things happen, Nick.

17:50.816 --> 17:53.114
What? What's wrong?

17:57.656 --> 18:00.921
Shit. They're here in the market.

18:00.993 --> 18:02.119
Who?

18:02.962 --> 18:05.157
- Who?
- They're in the market! Come on!

18:05.231 --> 18:06.562
- Division?
- Bleeders!

18:06.665 --> 18:07.791
We've got to get out of here!

18:22.348 --> 18:23.610
- How does this end?
- I have no idea.

18:23.716 --> 18:25.047
Where is the girl?

18:25.718 --> 18:27.743
My daughter has already
seen you with her.

18:27.853 --> 18:29.252
Told you.

18:30.489 --> 18:33.117
I've told three people already today,
I don't know this girl.

18:34.994 --> 18:38.020
Stupid child.
I already saw how you die.

18:38.130 --> 18:40.758
Then you know it's not here
and it's not today.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.132
Damn.

18:51.310 --> 18:52.777
Go, go!

19:05.591 --> 19:06.888
Go, go!

19:12.631 --> 19:14.155
Go, go!

19:20.606 --> 19:22.164
Nick!

19:29.548 --> 19:31.140
The big tanks... Go!

19:31.884 --> 19:33.442
- Quick!
- This way!

19:58.711 --> 20:00.042
Stop!

20:01.146 --> 20:03.580
- Stop!
- Run, Cassie!

20:04.917 --> 20:06.111
Stop!

20:21.433 --> 20:22.627
Not like this...

20:23.002 --> 20:24.970
...lf we kill him we lose the girl

23:30.556 --> 23:32.285
I already know you're here.

23:40.799 --> 23:42.562
You must be Cassie Holmes.

23:43.802 --> 23:45.770
- Who sent you?
- Your mother.

23:48.407 --> 23:50.375
A week before she was captured
by Division,

23:50.609 --> 23:52.839
she told me to be
at that fish market today.

23:54.613 --> 23:56.046
Stay away from him.

23:56.615 --> 23:57.980
If that's what you want.

23:58.050 --> 24:00.883
Just be sure to add his picture
to the Wall of the Dead.

24:02.354 --> 24:03.412
You're a stitch.

24:03.522 --> 24:05.547
That should be obvious to a watcher.

24:06.358 --> 24:08.883
If you had even a modicum
of your mother's talent...

24:08.994 --> 24:10.291
I've been dealing with a lot.

24:10.362 --> 24:13.229
Years ago your mother did me a favor.

24:13.332 --> 24:15.425
Now it would seem
I need to pay off my debt.

24:35.587 --> 24:38.715
I hear they've got your mother
buried deep inside Division.

24:41.527 --> 24:45.156
Have her so drugged up
she can't even hold a spoon.

24:46.398 --> 24:49.390
I bet they suck
the future right out of her.

25:24.736 --> 25:26.465
You help her and you help us all.

25:27.873 --> 25:28.999
A flower

25:46.825 --> 25:48.156
Is he okay?

26:23.996 --> 26:26.294
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:30.802 --> 26:31.962
Wow.

26:32.571 --> 26:34.402
That woman's got magic fingers.

26:44.116 --> 26:45.413
For you.

26:46.151 --> 26:47.482
What is that?

26:48.921 --> 26:49.910
It's a lotus.

27:11.009 --> 27:12.772
I heard what she said about
your mother.

27:14.513 --> 27:15.878
You did?

27:19.885 --> 27:21.409
Division's got her.

27:22.321 --> 27:25.484
They locked her up because she's the...
greatest watcher they've ever seen.

27:26.558 --> 27:28.082
They're afraid of her.

27:28.427 --> 27:30.292
And they're afraid
they can't control her.

27:31.964 --> 27:33.989
They killed my father
for the same reason.

27:36.835 --> 27:38.325
But I guess you already knew that.

27:39.805 --> 27:42.569
I see the future, not the past.

27:44.376 --> 27:47.641
And right now our future
isn't that great.

27:49.748 --> 27:51.010
That's new?

27:51.550 --> 27:53.347
Now the sniffs from your apartment

27:53.485 --> 27:55.146
are going to get the girl and the case.

27:56.755 --> 27:58.120
It's changed.

27:58.924 --> 28:01.051
I don't know why...

28:01.560 --> 28:04.051
something I did, a mistake I made...

28:05.364 --> 28:08.527
Doesn't matter, it just has.

28:11.636 --> 28:13.968
My mother told me that case...

28:14.106 --> 28:17.405
is the key to bringing down Division
and freeing her.

28:20.212 --> 28:22.510
There's no money in that case,
is there?

28:26.718 --> 28:28.811
Unless I'm missing something,

28:29.921 --> 28:31.354
they don't have the case yet.

28:32.924 --> 28:34.585
It's still out there.

28:38.196 --> 28:39.788
If your mother's such
a great fortune-teller,

28:39.931 --> 28:41.364
how did she get caught?

28:41.867 --> 28:43.994
I'm just going to have
to ask her that myself.

28:45.303 --> 28:47.203
I haven't even gotten
to the bad part yet.

28:51.109 --> 28:52.303
What is that?

28:53.311 --> 28:54.676
We die.

28:56.448 --> 28:58.006
Great.

29:23.608 --> 29:25.075
Hello, Kira.

29:30.015 --> 29:31.312
You have a plane to catch.

29:31.650 --> 29:33.447
Come on.
You want to come with us.

29:47.599 --> 29:50.124
Christ. Get a load of that.

29:50.235 --> 29:54.763
She must use that ten times a day.
That's a keeper.

29:55.207 --> 29:57.732
You're not gonna have a lot of lipstick
opportunities where you're going.

29:57.809 --> 29:59.071
You know what I mean?

30:02.814 --> 30:04.042
She's doing it again.

30:04.116 --> 30:06.710
- Get the hell out of my head!
- No! No!

30:07.652 --> 30:09.950
- What does she want?
- She's got to go to the bathroom.

30:10.288 --> 30:11.846
To throw up or something.

30:11.957 --> 30:14.152
Carver will kill us
if anything happens to her.

30:28.507 --> 30:30.168
- Bathroom?
- This way.

30:32.277 --> 30:33.369
Come on.

30:37.415 --> 30:39.542
Coffee, black, with sugar.

30:53.765 --> 30:55.596
Alright. In you go.

31:09.481 --> 31:11.278
You're a good man, Agent Mack.

31:12.884 --> 31:14.909
I bet you come from a good family.

31:16.855 --> 31:19.085
It must have been hard
for you when he died.

31:19.958 --> 31:21.118
Who died?

31:22.194 --> 31:23.525
Your brother.

31:24.095 --> 31:26.495
- I don't have a brother, sweetheart.
- No, you do.

31:27.332 --> 31:29.197
I've got something
that will make you feel better.

31:30.001 --> 31:32.333
And you loved him very much.

31:35.974 --> 31:37.771
But he was murdered.

31:37.909 --> 31:40.309
And you know who did it, don't you?

31:52.190 --> 31:53.521
But he was murdered...

31:54.192 --> 31:56.456
And you know who did it, don't you?

32:00.365 --> 32:03.892
You know who did it, don't you?
But he was murdered...

32:18.416 --> 32:22.250
You know who did it
he was murdered...

34:25.710 --> 34:27.177
Lame.

34:28.112 --> 34:30.411
We've got to work on your skills
if we're going to change anything.

34:30.482 --> 34:31.972
Don't bite your nails.

34:35.152 --> 34:37.143
The lollipop chick freaks me out.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.049
- She's a watcher.
- Like you.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.085
Yeah.

34:44.129 --> 34:46.723
I know this place. This is...

34:47.766 --> 34:51.360
I know this place.
Club B, boss. Science Museum Road.

34:52.103 --> 34:53.364
Thank you.

34:55.039 --> 34:56.630
Why is that olive out of the glass?

34:57.809 --> 35:00.972
- That's not an olive. It's a bead.
- It's a bead?

35:01.613 --> 35:04.844
Yeah, it's a bead.
A shimmery kind of thing...

35:04.949 --> 35:07.417
Well, it looks like a pimento.
If I was going to draw a bead, I'd...

35:07.519 --> 35:09.453
It's a bead with a shimmer.

35:10.155 --> 35:11.679
What does the bead have to do with it?

35:11.790 --> 35:14.350
I don't know what the shiny,
shimmery bead has to do with it.

35:14.893 --> 35:16.053
Great.

35:16.928 --> 35:18.259
Let's keep it simple.

35:18.596 --> 35:20.587
We'll start with the bead
and see where it takes us.

35:20.665 --> 35:24.101
Sounds like a plan, but...
what about the part where we die?

35:39.317 --> 35:40.944
I remember growing up together.

35:41.352 --> 35:43.149
Where we went to school.

35:44.088 --> 35:45.385
How he died.

35:47.158 --> 35:49.149
So except for this brother
you never had...

35:50.128 --> 35:52.619
is there anything else she might have
put in your head?

35:53.064 --> 35:55.191
I'm only asking because I don't
want to be shot in the face...

35:55.333 --> 35:57.824
for screwing some made up sister
you don't really have.

35:59.204 --> 36:00.569
I don't have a sister?

36:07.612 --> 36:10.376
Agent Mack,
you are relieved of duty.

36:10.482 --> 36:12.347
Get on a plane, eat some peanuts,
and go home.

36:12.484 --> 36:13.815
She won't push me again, sir.

36:13.885 --> 36:15.284
She just caught me off-guard.

36:15.353 --> 36:17.913
The only thoughts
in my head are my own.

36:19.224 --> 36:21.192
You're willing to risk your life on that?

36:22.193 --> 36:23.251
Yes, sir.

36:23.361 --> 36:26.489
Then put the gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

36:30.401 --> 36:31.732
Don't worry.

36:32.070 --> 36:34.834
You already checked it.
It's not loaded.

36:42.914 --> 36:45.906
Spread these beads to any sniff,
any watcher,

36:45.984 --> 36:48.186
any goddamn expatriate reader
in Hong Kong

36:48.186 --> 36:51.485
who knows up from down
until we find Kira.

36:52.690 --> 36:54.555
What about the Chinese government
and their guys?

36:55.026 --> 36:58.052
The story is out, bleeders all over
the country will be looking for her.

36:58.496 --> 36:59.929
We can't let them get the drug.

37:00.331 --> 37:02.162
Then we put a price on her head.

37:09.774 --> 37:11.071
Yeah, this is it.

37:11.709 --> 37:14.576
Hey, can you... I don't have any...

37:14.646 --> 37:16.705
Yeah! Sure. I got it.

37:18.616 --> 37:21.141
There you go.
You can keep it. Thanks.

37:24.355 --> 37:25.322
How much do you have?

37:25.390 --> 37:26.755
Don't give him all of that.

37:26.824 --> 37:28.758
- It's not gonna be enough.
- It's enough.

37:28.826 --> 37:30.191
- Just give me the...
- It's enough. / Excuse me, sir?

37:30.328 --> 37:31.522
Hey. We need five minutes.

37:31.596 --> 37:32.688
- Five minutes
- Yeah!

37:34.365 --> 37:37.528
Listen, this is a place for grown-ups,

37:37.602 --> 37:39.467
- so behave yourself.
- Shut up.

37:40.204 --> 37:41.535
That sounds about right.

37:47.879 --> 37:50.848
- Choose another.
- Yeah! Show me...

37:50.949 --> 37:52.109
- Concentrate.
- Yes.

37:52.350 --> 37:56.252
- Queen of hearts.
- Okay. Watch. It's already here.

37:59.791 --> 38:03.693
Show me... Ace of spades.

38:08.399 --> 38:09.730
Think I know why we're here.

38:12.503 --> 38:13.970
You've got good hands.

38:14.038 --> 38:16.199
- Nick! You alright?
- Yeah.

38:16.307 --> 38:18.537
What's going on? Sit down.

38:20.044 --> 38:21.671
- Vodka martini?
- Thank you.

38:21.813 --> 38:22.973
I'll have one of those.

38:24.048 --> 38:25.174
She'll have a Coke.

38:25.283 --> 38:27.444
My mom drinks when
she wants to get really clear images.

38:27.585 --> 38:28.745
She's famous for it.

38:29.387 --> 38:30.911
Maybe something without caffeine.

38:31.322 --> 38:32.755
I've got it. Whoa.

38:33.625 --> 38:34.990
There's five.

38:36.494 --> 38:37.688
Keep the change.

38:37.795 --> 38:38.762
Thank you.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.394
I know who you are.

38:45.603 --> 38:46.968
When I was in Division,

38:47.071 --> 38:50.063
her mother was at the top
of every watch list there was.

38:51.209 --> 38:52.369
You worked for Division?

38:56.114 --> 38:57.809
You want to know about Division?

38:59.517 --> 39:02.611
Ten years. No thank you,
no pension.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.553
I was put out on the street
with a threat to not shift again.

39:07.325 --> 39:09.259
Only the sniffs caught up
with me in Chicago.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.295
I was just trying to buy
something nice for my wife.

39:13.564 --> 39:16.294
Next day I get a call, she's dead.

39:17.235 --> 39:18.793
Car accident.

39:20.038 --> 39:22.973
But my wife doesn't drive.

39:26.010 --> 39:29.173
But I don't have to remind
you how that feels, right?

39:36.154 --> 39:38.452
- We need this.
- An olive?

39:39.590 --> 39:40.989
It's a bead.

39:42.193 --> 39:45.162
It's supposed to lead us to someone
we need to find before Division does.

39:46.764 --> 39:48.698
Excuse me! May I?

39:51.202 --> 39:52.396
Thank you.

39:53.071 --> 39:54.333
You're welcome.

39:58.776 --> 39:59.800
Got it right?

40:00.845 --> 40:03.245
It's a little more round and shinier.

40:04.549 --> 40:05.948
That's it.

40:06.250 --> 40:07.717
That's just how I saw it.

40:10.321 --> 40:11.879
It won't last long.

40:11.989 --> 40:15.720
I'd take it Emily Hu.
She's ex-pat sniff.

40:16.027 --> 40:18.518
Only works by referral.
Here's her address.

40:20.198 --> 40:21.563
Thank you, Hook.

40:23.201 --> 40:24.395
Bye bye.

40:25.670 --> 40:27.069
Good luck.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.713
Here it is...

40:43.087 --> 40:45.055
Is she with someone else?

40:57.368 --> 40:58.835
Yes

40:59.971 --> 41:03.805
I see a man... and a boat

41:04.008 --> 41:05.600
Is she happy?

41:06.244 --> 41:07.905
Will she come back?

41:08.012 --> 41:10.708
It's a very big boat.

41:18.189 --> 41:19.156
May I help you?

41:19.290 --> 41:20.917
Hook Waters sent us.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.254
A bead that looks like this one
is supposed to lead us to a girl.

41:32.637 --> 41:34.002
You with Division?

41:35.206 --> 41:36.764
Are you looking at us?

41:38.042 --> 41:40.101
The truth is,
the girl who dropped that bead...

41:40.211 --> 41:42.771
is supposed to have a suitcase
that will bring down Division.

41:42.847 --> 41:46.146
Cassie here thinks that
if we don't find it, we die.

41:46.317 --> 41:47.807
And you believe her?

41:49.453 --> 41:51.080
She's pretty convincing.

41:51.189 --> 41:53.555
Well, consider me unconvinced.

42:01.365 --> 42:03.356
Looks like we've just got to wait.

42:03.534 --> 42:04.558
For what?

42:04.635 --> 42:06.398
You have about one minute to help us.

42:08.406 --> 42:09.600
And what's that?

42:09.774 --> 42:12.334
That's your... poster.

42:13.611 --> 42:15.772
- That's the bead.
- That's the clock.

42:16.547 --> 42:18.674
- It's... right now...
- You've got about a minute.

42:22.153 --> 42:23.950
You guys can't be serious.

42:24.055 --> 42:25.352
Don't look at me.

42:25.590 --> 42:27.751
This girl's been going
at it with that plan all day.

42:27.959 --> 42:30.655
Everything that ends up on this pad
seems to be coming true.

42:30.995 --> 42:33.156
I just see it like I'm looking
at a photograph.

42:37.468 --> 42:39.834
Look... we want Division
out of Hong Kong...

42:39.971 --> 42:41.438
just as much as you do.

42:41.806 --> 42:44.832
It's going to be a whole lot easier
if you help us find the girl.

42:46.043 --> 42:48.273
You remind me of someone...

42:48.346 --> 42:50.211
...I used to know

42:54.986 --> 42:56.317
Fine.

42:59.991 --> 43:02.755
They've been spreading these
all over the city.

43:14.839 --> 43:19.367
You'll find who you're looking
for on Kwun Tong Pier.

43:51.075 --> 43:52.372
Excuse me!

43:53.878 --> 43:56.904
Excuse me. Speak any English?

43:57.014 --> 43:58.174
- No.
- No.

43:58.282 --> 44:02.514
It doesn't really matter.
I just need a ride.

44:04.588 --> 44:06.055
We're old friends, right?

44:13.030 --> 44:15.828
I know. I should have called.

44:32.917 --> 44:34.145
Whoa, whoa!

44:35.186 --> 44:37.552
- Kira?
- Dammit!

44:37.688 --> 44:39.656
- What the hell are you doing here?
- There goes my ride!

44:40.224 --> 44:42.385
- Don't.
- Don't. Don't what?

44:42.593 --> 44:44.117
You're the girl everyone's looking for?

44:44.195 --> 44:45.560
- I should kill you, Nick.
- Hey!

44:45.730 --> 44:47.027
You know this psycho?

44:47.164 --> 44:48.825
- What happened to you?
- Now you want to know?

44:49.367 --> 44:51.198
What does that mean?
I thought you left.

44:51.335 --> 44:52.324
You stopped returning my calls.

44:52.436 --> 44:54.165
Division caught me
and locked me up.

44:54.271 --> 44:56.171
- What?
- And you never came.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.367
I looked for you. I did!

45:00.344 --> 45:01.606
You didn't find me.

45:02.513 --> 45:05.311
It's done! You had a thing.
Get over it.

45:05.616 --> 45:08.210
I really suggest we discuss
this somewhere else.

45:09.720 --> 45:11.085
Let's go, Nick.

45:25.002 --> 45:27.266
Kira. Division's looking for you.

45:27.838 --> 45:29.669
They're looking for the case.

45:30.207 --> 45:31.435
And so are you.

45:31.876 --> 45:33.366
What's in that case?

45:33.944 --> 45:35.206
I don't know.

45:35.613 --> 45:37.103
All I know is that I woke up on a boat

45:37.214 --> 45:39.307
next to a note I'd written
saying to look for you

45:39.383 --> 45:41.146
and you'd help me find the case.

45:43.387 --> 45:45.947
I don't remember anything
about the last couple of days...

45:46.590 --> 45:48.455
no matter how hard I try.

45:49.226 --> 45:50.784
You must have had yourself wiped.

45:51.796 --> 45:54.356
Erased memories make it harder
for Division to track you.

45:57.001 --> 45:58.525
Not the ones of you.

46:02.006 --> 46:03.530
Can I talk to you for a sec?

46:04.375 --> 46:05.569
Can it wait?

46:05.910 --> 46:07.002
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

46:07.111 --> 46:08.305
No.

46:13.050 --> 46:14.745
You, me, and my mom.

46:15.753 --> 46:17.948
I've never seen my mom's
death before.

46:19.123 --> 46:20.351
It's her, Nick.

46:20.991 --> 46:23.755
She's changing the future,
and she's making it worse.

46:23.894 --> 46:25.452
- We've got to dump her.
- Dump her?

46:25.796 --> 46:27.093
Cassie, we...

46:28.399 --> 46:29.764
Cassie! We just found her.

46:29.867 --> 46:31.391
And she doesn't have the case.

46:31.469 --> 46:32.436
Which is what we're looking for,

46:32.570 --> 46:34.003
- if you remember.
- Yeah! I know.

46:35.239 --> 46:37.139
We find her, we find the case.

46:37.208 --> 46:39.438
- The three of us.
- Yeah, and then Division finds her.

46:39.610 --> 46:41.305
Oh yeah, the three of us.

46:44.548 --> 46:46.743
We'll get a shadow
so they can't trace her.

46:46.851 --> 46:48.512
- Satisfied?
- No.

46:50.588 --> 46:51.919
Cassie, you've got to trust me.

46:51.989 --> 46:53.923
I'm not the one
with the trust issues here.

46:53.991 --> 46:55.151
You better do something quick

46:55.226 --> 46:57.456
because I'm getting sick
of drawing dead bodies.

47:27.191 --> 47:28.453
That's him.

47:29.827 --> 47:31.260
- Hey, Pinky.
- Hey, Nick.

47:31.362 --> 47:33.922
- Hey.
- Alright, who's feeling the heat?

47:36.267 --> 47:37.564
Alright.

47:38.469 --> 47:39.766
Here's how this works:

47:39.837 --> 47:42.271
I get ten grand a day
for shadowing Miss Trouble.

47:42.373 --> 47:44.170
As long as she stays
within twenty feet of me,

47:44.241 --> 47:45.731
no sniff is gonna find her.

47:45.809 --> 47:46.833
I don't care
if they're standing right on top

47:46.911 --> 47:48.640
of us with a piece of her fingernail.

47:49.213 --> 47:51.306
- Happy?
- Overcome.

47:51.615 --> 47:53.708
Come on. Let's find a place to think.

47:56.754 --> 48:00.281
So Pinky,
your wife give you that name?

48:00.925 --> 48:02.916
No, the Division did, sweetheart.

48:03.761 --> 48:05.058
Back in the day.

48:14.004 --> 48:17.132
I'm sorry. I can't remember
anything about the case.

48:17.641 --> 48:19.233
Shocking.

48:22.613 --> 48:24.774
Can I clean up without getting killed?

48:24.848 --> 48:26.873
Don't forget to wash
behind your ears.

48:31.155 --> 48:32.713
Nice girlfriend you've got there.

48:32.790 --> 48:35.554
Yeah. She used to be.

48:35.626 --> 48:38.561
I met her running cons
on Coney Island tourists.

48:39.597 --> 48:41.588
We did everything together.
Everything.

48:41.665 --> 48:43.098
So we're just gonna sit around

48:43.200 --> 48:44.929
and wait for her to get
her memory back...

48:45.002 --> 48:47.971
and hope that she'll tell us where
the case is before Carver gets it?

48:48.973 --> 48:50.372
Or us.

48:51.208 --> 48:52.607
Great plan.

48:53.110 --> 48:54.304
Where you going?

48:54.511 --> 48:57.071
I saw a chicken place downstairs.
Want to come?

48:57.214 --> 48:59.705
No, I'm good. I want to stay here,
see if I can help.

48:59.783 --> 49:01.080
Have fun with that.

49:21.238 --> 49:22.398
Where you going?

49:23.440 --> 49:24.668
Relax, Romeo.

49:24.808 --> 49:27.003
I can shade her just fine out
in the hall.

49:28.612 --> 49:30.807
I don't need to be a watcher
to see where this is going.

50:21.598 --> 50:23.429
Oh! Sorry about that.

50:24.201 --> 50:26.761
I thought the bathroom was on fire.

50:26.870 --> 50:29.600
I had to get you to come
in somehow.

50:30.607 --> 50:31.869
Did you push me?

50:32.009 --> 50:33.306
You didn't like it?

50:35.346 --> 50:36.870
Push back.

51:12.816 --> 51:15.614
My father expects me to find
that suitcase.

51:15.686 --> 51:16.948
So does my mother.

51:17.354 --> 51:19.754
But you don't see it clearly, do you?

51:20.224 --> 51:21.919
Too many things keep changing.

51:23.227 --> 51:25.252
I already saw how you die.

51:26.130 --> 51:27.563
Did you see it yet?

51:32.636 --> 51:34.160
You can change it, you know.

51:34.271 --> 51:36.762
Plenty of planes
leaving Hong Kong every day.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.569
Oh, we are going to change it.

51:39.076 --> 51:41.101
You put a shadow on the girl.

51:42.112 --> 51:44.239
You know that's only temporary.

51:45.048 --> 51:48.745
That girl is the one who brings
all your little fantasies crashing down.

51:49.353 --> 51:51.685
So tell Nick something for me,
little girl.

51:52.122 --> 51:55.523
Tell him my family is going to make
his brain pop like a tomato.

51:55.826 --> 51:58.590
Tell him that's the future I see.

52:13.544 --> 52:14.977
Oh, boy.

52:17.114 --> 52:18.308
Hello?

52:19.917 --> 52:22.477
There you are.
Where is the chicky-chicky...

52:22.586 --> 52:24.451
- who gets us all killed?
- Are you drunk?

52:24.521 --> 52:25.613
Yeah.

52:26.256 --> 52:28.554
I'm sorry. I didn't know the procedure
for stopping a blitzed ten-year-old.

52:28.625 --> 52:32.561
I'm thirteen!
And I am powering my use!

52:32.629 --> 52:34.598
I can't believe this.

52:34.598 --> 52:35.895
I am working.

52:36.867 --> 52:39.563
- You screw it all up!
- Alright...

52:39.636 --> 52:41.729
Give me this. What is this?
We talked about this, Cassie.

52:41.805 --> 52:42.829
Nobody is going anywhere.

52:42.906 --> 52:44.771
- What is this?
- You don't get it, Nick.

52:46.109 --> 52:48.475
She is the one that kills us all,
basically.

52:48.612 --> 52:49.579
Then I guess we're all gonna get killed.

52:49.646 --> 52:51.113
Yeah. Screwed up.

52:51.215 --> 52:53.308
By "we", you mean not...

52:53.383 --> 52:54.475
You, too.

52:55.953 --> 52:58.615
Pop Girl's a better watcher than I am.

52:58.755 --> 53:01.053
Whoa! No one said anything
about a watcher.

53:01.124 --> 53:03.149
I can only work long-term
against the sniffs.

53:03.227 --> 53:05.525
- Good.
- No! True story.

53:05.596 --> 53:07.928
You've got a watcher after you.
It's just a matter of time.

53:09.199 --> 53:11.633
Then we'll split up.

53:11.768 --> 53:14.134
We'll give her two things
to track instead of one.

53:14.204 --> 53:17.640
- Pinky, take Kira somewhere safe
- I'm not going with him.

53:17.808 --> 53:18.968
No offense.

53:19.076 --> 53:20.600
None taken, cupcake.

53:20.744 --> 53:22.302
I know you're sweet on the champ.

53:22.846 --> 53:24.074
I'll find you.

53:37.160 --> 53:38.855
Let's let her sleep for a bit.

54:02.386 --> 54:04.251
She's a step ahead of our sister.

54:04.321 --> 54:05.589
Father will be displeased...

54:05.589 --> 54:06.954
She saw me coming.

54:09.793 --> 54:11.351
Maybe she's better than you?

54:12.629 --> 54:14.153
She still dies!

54:22.005 --> 54:23.563
She's gone, you know.

54:26.376 --> 54:28.037
I'm just saying...

54:31.548 --> 54:33.846
- You okay?
- No...

54:35.786 --> 54:37.720
Not until we find that case.

54:38.488 --> 54:39.955
When was the last time you saw it?

54:40.090 --> 54:41.387
Not since yesterday.

54:42.159 --> 54:44.457
Not for lack of trying, though.

54:46.129 --> 54:49.621
If we don't find it soon,
they're gonna kill my mom.

54:50.601 --> 54:52.091
And it's gonna be my fault.

55:09.252 --> 55:10.617
Look at me.

55:11.188 --> 55:12.746
Hey! Look at me.

55:13.390 --> 55:14.948
You really think
I'm gonna let that happen?

55:16.727 --> 55:18.319
You said the future's
always changing, right?

55:18.428 --> 55:19.452
It can change just by knowing it?

55:19.529 --> 55:22.555
It can change.
It doesn't mean it will.

55:26.003 --> 55:27.595
- Good enough.
- What are you doing?

55:28.171 --> 55:29.229
What are you gonna go do?

55:29.306 --> 55:30.739
I'm gonna try and make a better one.

55:32.009 --> 55:33.977
Going after Carver
doesn't change anything.

55:34.144 --> 55:35.634
It doesn't save me,
it doesn't save you,

55:35.712 --> 55:36.838
it doesn't save her.

55:36.947 --> 55:38.710
It's just a matter of time, Cassie.

55:38.815 --> 55:40.680
If I don't go to him, he'll come for us.

55:50.027 --> 55:51.153
Emily, it's Nick.

55:52.195 --> 55:54.322
Division sent a pusher named Carver
to Hong Kong.

55:54.431 --> 55:55.591
I need you to find him.

55:57.968 --> 56:00.869
Just use that bead they gave you.
I'm sure his hands were all over it.

56:29.399 --> 56:31.697
- We're not open.
- I'm not hungry.

57:29.593 --> 57:31.117
Henry Carver.

57:35.065 --> 57:37.932
Now there's a face
I haven't seen in a long time.

57:44.174 --> 57:45.641
Sit down.

57:46.109 --> 57:48.304
The food is actually pretty good here.

57:54.284 --> 57:56.809
Give me one good
reason not to kill you right now.

57:58.989 --> 58:00.183
Good.

58:00.624 --> 58:02.489
Gonna try and get inside my head?

58:03.360 --> 58:04.725
Go ahead.

58:04.795 --> 58:07.389
See if you can push me
before I pull the trigger.

58:08.865 --> 58:12.801
Wow! Ten years is a long time
to hold a grudge.

58:12.936 --> 58:14.597
My father would disagree.

58:14.805 --> 58:18.866
- You piece of shit.
- Your father I had respect for.

58:18.975 --> 58:21.170
He took a stand with great integrity,

58:21.244 --> 58:23.804
which is more than anyone
can say about you.

58:28.985 --> 58:31.647
- If this is your attempt at...
- Think I don't know this future?

58:32.322 --> 58:33.550
Huh?

58:33.623 --> 58:36.649
I've got twenty of the best watchers
in the world...

58:36.760 --> 58:39.695
tracking every moment
of this time right now.

58:41.198 --> 58:42.722
You die, Nick.

58:44.034 --> 58:45.626
You all die.

58:46.169 --> 58:47.568
You know who doesn't?

58:49.506 --> 58:51.371
- Me.
- You sure about that?

58:54.010 --> 58:55.568
Okay.

58:56.613 --> 58:58.774
Kira is our patient zero.

58:59.216 --> 59:02.242
And with her we're going to create
an army the world's

59:02.352 --> 59:04.988
- never seen before...
- I'm sorry. Am I supposed to care?

59:04.988 --> 59:08.355
Fine. Fuck patriotism.

59:08.758 --> 59:11.955
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.

59:13.663 --> 59:16.359
And you're not going to find
it anywhere but with me.

59:18.668 --> 59:20.465
Maybe you care about that.

59:24.641 --> 59:26.074
Tell me something, Nick.

59:27.010 --> 59:29.308
Her blood turn black yet?

59:30.747 --> 59:32.977
No? Insides running out?

59:37.087 --> 59:39.487
Or is she keeping that
away from you, too?

59:45.962 --> 59:48.021
I'll take that as a yes.

01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:01.786
You already know
the ending to this story.

01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:03.990
You can only draw it so many ways.

01:02:07.037 --> 01:02:08.595
We're going to change it.

01:02:12.008 --> 01:02:13.839
You don't believe that, do you?

01:02:14.411 --> 01:02:15.810
Please...

01:02:17.347 --> 01:02:19.872
don't make me do anything to myself.

01:02:20.884 --> 01:02:23.045
Hurting you would change the future.

01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:25.946
And I like how this future goes.

01:02:26.923 --> 01:02:28.288
So will killing him.

01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:45.669
Victor!

01:03:05.929 --> 01:03:07.794
I think I just saved your life.

01:03:09.032 --> 01:03:11.762
There's no need to thank me.
You should just start listening to me.

01:03:18.274 --> 01:03:19.571
You look like shit.

01:03:39.028 --> 01:03:40.791
- Where is she?
- 5-A.

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.591
- Is she safe?
- Yeah.

01:03:42.665 --> 01:03:44.758
She's sick, though. Pretty bad.

01:04:33.316 --> 01:04:35.113
I need to ask you a question.

01:04:37.353 --> 01:04:38.877
What's in the case?

01:04:43.893 --> 01:04:46.157
It's a drug.

01:04:46.729 --> 01:04:50.529
Some sort of psychic steroid
that boosts our abilities...

01:04:51.134 --> 01:04:52.499
but kills us.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.969
They want me back

01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:02.044
because I'm the only one...
who survived the injection.

01:05:07.584 --> 01:05:09.882
Tell me why I just drew a picture
of me holding her shoe.

01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:25.193
Is she okay?

01:05:27.136 --> 01:05:29.806
What? No.
You've got to be kidding me.

01:05:29.806 --> 01:05:31.671
- She's dying.
- You are not bringing me into this.

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:33.334
You're already in it.

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:35.775
We need to know
what this key unlocks.

01:05:36.679 --> 01:05:37.976
Please.

01:05:40.216 --> 01:05:42.150
Cassie,
how much do the Chinese know?

01:05:42.352 --> 01:05:44.047
Whatever we do. It could be more.

01:05:44.687 --> 01:05:46.154
Their watcher is better than me.

01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:48.723
We know there's a suitcase
with a Division drug in it.

01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:50.281
Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.452
Can you draw us a way out of this?

01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:53.358
We can't change anything
with that bitch tracking us.

01:05:53.496 --> 01:05:54.963
The second we do,
she's gonna see it.

01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:57.000
- What do you mean?
- She sees intentions.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.558
What we decide to do.

01:05:58.635 --> 01:06:01.365
I decide to cross the street,
so she sees me crossing the street.

01:06:01.871 --> 01:06:03.771
What if nothing we did made sense?

01:06:04.674 --> 01:06:06.005
Or we just kept changing our mind,

01:06:06.075 --> 01:06:08.168
we didn't know exactly
what we were gonna do?

01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:09.976
Would that throw her off?

01:06:10.046 --> 01:06:12.241
It might, but we still have
to find the case.

01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:25.850
Whatever this key unlocks
is being shadowed.

01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:28.160
Like I've never seen before.

01:06:29.532 --> 01:06:30.897
It's this way.

01:06:35.605 --> 01:06:37.266
That really narrows it down.

01:06:41.611 --> 01:06:43.806
If it's shadowed,
I won't be able to draw.

01:06:54.957 --> 01:06:56.652
There's a building missing.

01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:04.155
I thought shadows weren't supposed

01:07:04.233 --> 01:07:06.133
to be effective against
watchers like Cassie.

01:07:06.202 --> 01:07:07.533
They're not.

01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:11.230
We're not supposed to be able
to shade entire buildings either.

01:07:35.998 --> 01:07:37.761
You wanted to see me?

01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:42.796
I'm going to need your help.

01:07:47.243 --> 01:07:49.370
Watchers from everywhere
are tracking us.

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:51.003
Carver... the Chinese...

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.809
Anything we think we're gonna do,
they know about it.

01:07:52.915 --> 01:07:55.315
That's why we all keep dying
in Cassie's book.

01:07:55.885 --> 01:07:58.513
- Pardon?
- You die outside an elevator.

01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:00.922
Oh.

01:08:02.358 --> 01:08:04.690
How are we gonna make
the future unpredictable?

01:08:04.794 --> 01:08:06.762
By not knowing what we're gonna do

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.963
until right before we do it.

01:08:09.031 --> 01:08:11.966
- Like a plan without planning.
- Yes. Right.

01:08:12.268 --> 01:08:13.326
Okay!

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:17.435
I'll write letters to each of you
giving you specific instruction.

01:08:18.107 --> 01:08:19.870
You don't open them until I tell you.

01:08:22.545 --> 01:08:25.104
Then the last letter,
I write to myself...

01:08:26.616 --> 01:08:28.550
and wipe the memory
of ever having written them.

01:08:28.684 --> 01:08:31.050
That's why I need you to find
the guy that wiped Kira.

01:08:31.953 --> 01:08:34.444
- Sure thing.
- That sounds like a great plan.

01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:38.483
- Do you have a better one?
- We're flying blind.

01:08:38.795 --> 01:08:39.921
Yeah.

01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:43.528
Cassie...

01:08:43.733 --> 01:08:45.598
I need one more drawing out of you.

01:08:45.935 --> 01:08:48.926
I need to know the exact size
and shape of that case.

01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:50.537
And that syringe.

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.469
Our watchers say it is already here.

01:10:02.044 --> 01:10:03.238
Father...

01:10:03.346 --> 01:10:05.906
I know what Division is looking for...

01:10:06.015 --> 01:10:07.277
It's a syringe.

01:10:09.352 --> 01:10:12.844
with this drug we'll be more powerful
than Division.

01:10:31.307 --> 01:10:35.368
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.

01:10:35.912 --> 01:10:39.211
You're not going to find the stuff
anywhere but with me.

01:10:45.354 --> 01:10:46.946
You die, Nick.

01:10:48.124 --> 01:10:50.319
You all die.

01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:19.652
You need the medicine
that Carver has.

01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:24.050
I'm not gonna watch you die.

01:11:28.397 --> 01:11:30.126
I'll come back for you.

01:11:36.405 --> 01:11:37.770
I promise.

01:11:51.787 --> 01:11:53.152
When do I open it?

01:11:55.391 --> 01:11:57.188
When you start to doubt the truth.

01:12:16.812 --> 01:12:19.246
- You know when to open these.
- You sure this is right?

01:12:20.316 --> 01:12:21.681
No.

01:12:29.225 --> 01:12:30.317
Nick?

01:12:32.762 --> 01:12:34.127
Take an umbrella.

01:12:34.997 --> 01:12:36.430
It's gonna rain.

01:12:38.134 --> 01:12:39.965
You be careful, too.

01:13:04.293 --> 01:13:06.693
You make us chase
you halfway across the world...

01:13:06.796 --> 01:13:09.822
then you let a hack
like Pinky Stein bring you in?

01:13:09.965 --> 01:13:12.331
- I'm sick.
- You're sick?

01:13:12.568 --> 01:13:14.035
You don't know what you are.

01:13:17.006 --> 01:13:18.371
Victor, pay the man.

01:13:39.161 --> 01:13:40.492
Of course.

01:13:48.471 --> 01:13:50.234
I knew I wouldn't get paid yet.

01:13:50.406 --> 01:13:51.668
Wait here.

01:13:52.808 --> 01:13:54.002
Were you followed?

01:13:54.477 --> 01:13:56.001
I'm never followed.

01:13:57.913 --> 01:13:59.175
Where is this guy?

01:13:59.715 --> 01:14:01.273
- Which one?
- The yellow one.

01:14:01.383 --> 01:14:02.873
- The big one?
- Yep.

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:36.347
Wo Chiang?

01:14:39.989 --> 01:14:41.479
You are here about the girl?

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.148
You're the one that wiped Kira?

01:14:43.793 --> 01:14:48.025
12 years ago, a woman told me
an American girl would come.

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:50.994
That was two days ago,
Kira showed.

01:14:52.935 --> 01:14:54.129
I have a job for you.

01:14:57.807 --> 01:14:59.672
Two hours ago,
I wrote seven letters.

01:14:59.809 --> 01:15:01.970
I need you to erase the memory
of ever having written them.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.308
Seven letters,
two hours of memory.

01:15:08.984 --> 01:15:11.111
The woman tell me those things.

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:14.552
She did not pay for you, too.

01:15:18.994 --> 01:15:21.121
And when you're done,
I need you to open this and read it.

01:15:24.033 --> 01:15:25.000
7:34

01:15:25.434 --> 01:15:27.732
- I need a minute.
- As you wish.

01:15:36.078 --> 01:15:39.878
I'm not gonna wake up
and forget who I am, am I?

01:15:46.522 --> 01:15:48.183
7:34... 7:35

01:16:04.673 --> 01:16:07.574
Wait, wait. No, just... go.

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:34.500
It's all gone.

01:16:35.604 --> 01:16:38.732
The future has... disappeared.

01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:40.339
I lost the connection.

01:16:59.228 --> 01:17:01.753
Halt. Identification?

01:17:02.364 --> 01:17:04.093
Safety inspector...

01:17:05.935 --> 01:17:08.233
I need to know where the security lockers are.

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.235
Certainly, sir. Go up the elevator...

01:17:10.606 --> 01:17:12.369
to the top floor.

01:17:12.508 --> 01:17:14.703
- Up this way?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.283
No problem.

01:18:13.469 --> 01:18:15.130
4,100

01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:36.323
The job is over.

01:18:36.392 --> 01:18:37.950
You don't have to shadow
the building anymore.

01:18:38.093 --> 01:18:39.788
The girl sent me...

01:18:43.365 --> 01:18:44.832
"4,100"

01:19:00.682 --> 01:19:02.115
Thank you.

01:19:02.351 --> 01:19:03.613
You ready?

01:19:06.855 --> 01:19:08.550
Right size, right shape.

01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:10.356
No problem.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.094
Better hurry. Won't last long.

01:19:33.549 --> 01:19:34.846
Crap.

01:20:33.909 --> 01:20:35.240
The Lord giveth.

01:20:41.517 --> 01:20:44.748
Did you really think
you could slip out of town with this?

01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:58.022
Tell me, was this worth dying for?

01:21:16.385 --> 01:21:18.751
No. He dies slowly.

01:21:18.854 --> 01:21:22.585
Your sister promised me that
and a great deal of money.

01:21:37.005 --> 01:21:40.031
Do you know how many people
in the world would kill for this drug?

01:21:43.879 --> 01:21:44.903
Now...

01:21:51.486 --> 01:21:52.953
Where is Cassie?

01:21:56.892 --> 01:21:58.723
Get me back on my feet.

01:22:17.512 --> 01:22:19.412
Perhaps the Pop family
can't be relied upon.

01:22:30.225 --> 01:22:32.250
Didn't see that one coming,
did you?

01:22:32.361 --> 01:22:34.886
Do you really want to do this,
little girl?

01:22:34.997 --> 01:22:36.589
I know where the drug is.

01:22:36.665 --> 01:22:39.691
More importantly,
I know how you die.

01:22:39.801 --> 01:22:41.928
Do you want to know
what the tiger means?

01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:50.175
The drug is here.

01:22:50.279 --> 01:22:52.213
See if that will make him love you.

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:03.592
My note says I'm supposed
to tell you...

01:23:03.592 --> 01:23:06.186
the Division has Kira.
216 Batang Street.

01:23:07.429 --> 01:23:10.330
It said a lot on there.
Was everyone's that complicated?

01:23:11.433 --> 01:23:12.900
I knew you could handle it.

01:23:19.274 --> 01:23:21.333
This immuno-suppressant
will save your life

01:23:21.443 --> 01:23:23.707
and allow you
to reach your full potential.

01:23:25.647 --> 01:23:28.207
You're going to be a better you, Kira.

01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:34.886
You need to accept this reality.

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:38.655
We're not trying to hurt you. Kira.

01:23:38.994 --> 01:23:41.895
Matter of fact, your well being means
everything to us.

01:23:42.397 --> 01:23:43.989
Understand it's not your fault
you're forgetting

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:45.693
who you are and running from us.

01:23:45.767 --> 01:23:47.325
The drug has side effects.

01:23:47.402 --> 01:23:49.529
We have no way
of knowing the severity.

01:23:50.372 --> 01:23:53.603
I want you to know that
I blame myself for that, Agent Hollis.

01:24:02.184 --> 01:24:03.879
This isn't real.

01:24:13.595 --> 01:24:15.790
You volunteered, Kira.

01:24:16.465 --> 01:24:18.160
I was against it.

01:24:19.401 --> 01:24:22.529
You were certain you'd be
the one to survive the drug.

01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:26.537
I had to support you.
After all, we were partners.

01:24:28.844 --> 01:24:30.709
Then you panicked.

01:24:34.015 --> 01:24:35.482
Did you think you made it
all the way here...

01:24:35.584 --> 01:24:38.519
and eluded us for so long
without any training?

01:24:40.055 --> 01:24:42.080
That's the Division in you. Kira.

01:24:43.759 --> 01:24:45.488
Now let me help you remember.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.425
Let me help you remember.

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:05.036
I keep trying to draw
something different, but I can't.

01:25:07.416 --> 01:25:09.145
It's something to do with how I die.

01:25:09.284 --> 01:25:10.308
It's a tiger.

01:25:10.585 --> 01:25:12.485
I'm serious.

01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:16.384
I don't know how I know,
but I just know.

01:25:18.293 --> 01:25:21.456
I know I act like
I don't care sometimes,

01:25:22.397 --> 01:25:24.490
- but I don't want to die.
- Cassie...

01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:30.934
It's not gonna happen, okay?

01:25:31.807 --> 01:25:34.275
Just tell me that I'm a crappy artist
and that I'm wrong.

01:25:34.409 --> 01:25:37.970
You are a crappy artist
and you are wrong.

01:25:38.046 --> 01:25:39.172
Listen to me.

01:25:40.415 --> 01:25:42.508
You've already done
more than enough for everyone.

01:25:43.185 --> 01:25:44.948
The only thing
you've got to worry about right now

01:25:45.053 --> 01:25:47.647
- is keeping yourself safe.
- But how?

01:25:49.024 --> 01:25:50.150
Just start walking.

01:25:50.292 --> 01:25:51.350
Don't even think about
where you're going.

01:25:51.426 --> 01:25:54.554
Just keep moving. And don't make any
decisions any watcher can track.

01:25:55.564 --> 01:25:57.429
And when you come across
someplace safe,

01:25:58.133 --> 01:26:00.966
you hide. Simple as that.

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.765
I don't know how,
but I know this is gonna work out.

01:26:03.972 --> 01:26:06.998
I promise.
No need to be scared. Trust me.

01:26:09.211 --> 01:26:10.678
That's more like it.

01:26:30.732 --> 01:26:31.960
What are you gonna do?

01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:36.164
I can't tell you.

01:29:31.312 --> 01:29:34.281
You make me look like a fool
in front of my family!

01:29:40.689 --> 01:29:42.054
Don't worry.

01:29:50.065 --> 01:29:51.794
You won't remember a thing.

01:29:55.203 --> 01:29:57.068
Your mother's very proud.

01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:12.108
I want to make a deal.
The drug for the girl.

01:30:14.723 --> 01:30:16.122
Okay.

01:30:17.525 --> 01:30:19.925
Dock 4, Man Yuen Street.

01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:37.368
Where is the case, Nick?

01:30:37.512 --> 01:30:38.672
Kira!

01:30:44.452 --> 01:30:45.749
Go ahead.

01:30:48.523 --> 01:30:50.923
Remember that night
under the roller coaster?

01:30:53.194 --> 01:30:55.992
We parked in the rain
and got those little bottles of Jack.

01:31:03.571 --> 01:31:05.971
That was the first time
you told me you loved me.

01:31:09.544 --> 01:31:10.772
He remembers.

01:31:13.148 --> 01:31:15.173
I want to hear it from him.

01:31:17.552 --> 01:31:18.917
I remember.

01:31:22.123 --> 01:31:23.556
It never happened.

01:31:26.594 --> 01:31:28.755
We met for the first time yesterday.

01:31:30.565 --> 01:31:32.430
You've never been to Coney Island.

01:31:34.435 --> 01:31:36.426
Nobody's been to Coney Island.

01:31:39.607 --> 01:31:41.336
I used you, Nick.

01:31:43.344 --> 01:31:46.404
And the quicker we find that case,
the quicker I'll let you forget it.

01:31:50.985 --> 01:31:52.748
You might as well.

01:31:57.158 --> 01:32:00.924
My card says you have to take
the drug. Give me Carver.

01:32:00.995 --> 01:32:02.326
It's for you.

01:32:09.971 --> 01:32:12.064
- Hello!
- You want the case,

01:32:12.273 --> 01:32:13.604
you let them live.

01:32:13.808 --> 01:32:16.003
I'll tell you exactly where it is.

01:32:21.349 --> 01:32:23.408
- Another?
- Sure.

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:29.147
One for the road.

01:33:20.375 --> 01:33:22.002
Don't feel too bad.

01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:25.679
That push of Kira's
has worked on better men.

01:34:17.031 --> 01:34:18.396
4,100

01:34:41.589 --> 01:34:43.079
Kill him.

01:34:45.393 --> 01:34:46.985
If that's alright with you?

01:34:48.363 --> 01:34:49.830
The case...

01:34:58.006 --> 01:34:59.337
Agent Carver.

01:35:08.983 --> 01:35:10.951
The contents of this case
are the property

01:35:11.085 --> 01:35:12.712
of the United States government.

01:35:12.787 --> 01:35:15.449
Government?
We are the only government here.

01:35:15.556 --> 01:35:18.992
Be reasonable.
There is no need for anyone to die.

01:35:21.396 --> 01:35:23.990
We're not much
for diplomacy these days.

01:35:33.808 --> 01:35:36.971
Victor! Make me a way out of here!

01:35:51.626 --> 01:35:52.957
Kira!

01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:29.948
Kira!

01:37:50.678 --> 01:37:51.804
Kira...

01:40:31.205 --> 01:40:34.333
Whoa! I'm impressed.

01:40:34.408 --> 01:40:37.571
The engineers are always conservative
with their projections...

01:40:37.645 --> 01:40:38.612
but this is something else.

01:40:38.713 --> 01:40:41.682
Hey! We are on the same side.
Remember?

01:40:41.882 --> 01:40:43.281
Now why don't you march the men

01:40:43.351 --> 01:40:46.013
who tried to kill us off this roof,
and we'll call it a day.

01:40:47.188 --> 01:40:50.385
Wait! Kira! Don't do this!

01:40:50.624 --> 01:40:53.559
It's a push.
What Carver told you is a lie.

01:40:53.627 --> 01:40:55.322
I'm sure they make a card for this.

01:41:00.368 --> 01:41:01.733
Where were we?

01:41:02.603 --> 01:41:04.366
Where were we?

01:41:26.093 --> 01:41:27.651
You don't want to do that.

01:41:28.295 --> 01:41:29.284
Watch me.

01:41:29.463 --> 01:41:31.624
You'd be doing me a favor if you did.

01:41:31.799 --> 01:41:33.323
What's in that needle will kill you.

01:41:33.434 --> 01:41:35.902
I went through hundreds
of potentials to find her.

01:41:36.771 --> 01:41:38.170
She's our survival.

01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:43.235
Look at me.

01:41:48.349 --> 01:41:49.611
You know me.

01:41:52.319 --> 01:41:53.684
I know you.

01:41:59.493 --> 01:42:00.858
Look at me...

01:42:02.596 --> 01:42:03.824
Look at me.

01:42:10.805 --> 01:42:12.170
Let him do it.

01:43:01.922 --> 01:43:03.583
What a waste.

01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:44.163
I told you to bring an umbrella.

01:43:49.003 --> 01:43:50.800
Thought you said it was gonna rain.

01:43:51.372 --> 01:43:53.567
I also told you
I get things wrong sometimes.

01:43:59.713 --> 01:44:01.806
Maybe it will wash the crap
out of your hair.

01:44:07.955 --> 01:44:09.684
So where's the real case?

01:44:23.504 --> 01:44:24.835
There it is.

01:44:26.774 --> 01:44:30.972
How long do you think your mother
has been planning this?

01:44:32.746 --> 01:44:34.373
Since before I was born.

01:44:37.651 --> 01:44:38.743
This is the key, Nick.

01:44:38.886 --> 01:44:40.251
Division will do anything to keep

01:44:40.354 --> 01:44:42.151
this from getting into
the wrong hands.

01:44:43.023 --> 01:44:44.752
So we trade your mom for the drug?

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.855
I'm still working on that one.

01:44:52.132 --> 01:44:54.566
Hey, what was it that
I injected myself with?

01:44:55.035 --> 01:44:56.627
Nine Dragon Soy Sauce.

01:44:58.238 --> 01:44:59.603
That's gross.

01:45:01.008 --> 01:45:01.997
What about Kira?

01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:04.373
You're the watcher. You tell me.

01:45:05.212 --> 01:45:07.840
Don't worry.
We'll see Miss Trouble soon enough.

01:45:40.948 --> 01:45:42.506
When do I open it?

01:45:42.616 --> 01:45:44.550
When you start to doubt the truth.

01:46:24.191 --> 01:46:26.659
Put your gun in your mouth.

01:46:28.696 --> 01:46:30.163
Pull the trigger.

01:48:30.164 --> 01:48:31.164
