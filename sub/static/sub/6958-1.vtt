00:43.288 --> 00:44.516
Australia...

00:44.790 --> 00:46.417
... "The Land Down Under. "

00:46.925 --> 00:47.983
Rugged...

00:48.627 --> 00:49.616
...remote...

00:50.195 --> 00:52.186
...inhospitable and dangerous.

00:52.464 --> 00:55.024
Home to 20 million kangaroos.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.933
But there is one who is more elusive
and clever than all the rest.

01:00.238 --> 01:03.639
And his name is Kangaroo Jack.

01:05.677 --> 01:08.145
But my story doesn't begin in Australia.

01:09.982 --> 01:13.509
It begins 20 years ago, halfway around
the world on a beach in Brooklyn.

01:14.019 --> 01:15.281
That's me...

01:15.721 --> 01:17.086
...Charlie Carbone.

01:17.789 --> 01:21.225
Three things happened on this day
that would change my life.

01:21.393 --> 01:23.759
First, was that my mom met Sal.

01:24.129 --> 01:28.930
She hadn 't dated much since Dad died, but
I could tell right away she was interested.

01:29.101 --> 01:33.561
Why shouldn 't she be? Sal Maggio was a
respected member of the community.

01:33.739 --> 01:35.673
Well, feared and respected.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.698
Well, feared.

01:37.876 --> 01:39.776
And that's Frankie Lombardo.

01:39.945 --> 01:43.642
Fresh out of Juvenile Hall,
where they named a wing after him.

01:43.815 --> 01:46.613
Sal was grooming Frankie
to take over the family business...

01:46.785 --> 01:49.117
...a family I was about to become a part of.

01:50.889 --> 01:55.053
The second thing that happened
was that I met Louis Booker.

01:58.697 --> 02:03.157
Don't tell me.
You got 75 cents in your back pocket.

02:03.335 --> 02:06.133
You're wrong.
It's a Captain Amazing compass.

02:07.072 --> 02:11.065
-How much you want for it?
-It's not for sale. No way. Sorry.

02:11.443 --> 02:13.775
-Wanna play some ball?
-No. You play ball.

02:13.945 --> 02:17.346
I gotta check this entire beach
if I'm gonna make my car payment.

02:17.749 --> 02:20.149
-You've got a car?
-No, but I will.

02:20.318 --> 02:24.152
Now, step aside. My uncle only rented me
this metal detector for the day.

02:24.322 --> 02:25.687
-And the third...
-Hey, kid.

02:25.857 --> 02:28.018
...most important thing
that happened that day...

02:28.193 --> 02:29.182
Go long.

02:29.361 --> 02:31.591
...was that I went out for a 20-yard pass.

02:31.963 --> 02:35.330
Unfortunately, there was only 15 yards
worth of beach...

02:36.468 --> 02:40.427
...and a really strong undertow.
And I couldn 't swim.

02:46.712 --> 02:49.237
Hey, kid! You lost your....

02:55.487 --> 02:58.149
Somebody help! I think there's
a kid drowning out....

02:58.490 --> 02:59.752
I'll save you!

03:11.169 --> 03:13.535
That one moment changed my life...

03:14.005 --> 03:16.166
...because in all the years that followed...

03:16.374 --> 03:19.810
...Louis was better at getting
me into trouble than getting me out.

03:20.045 --> 03:23.310
A dreamer in search of treasure,
who only found bottle caps.

03:23.482 --> 03:25.643
On that fateful day, Louis saved my life.

03:25.851 --> 03:26.840
You see this guy?

03:27.018 --> 03:28.178
And I never forgot it.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.309
He just saved your life.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.384
He wouldn 't let me.

03:32.424 --> 03:34.221
And now it's 20 years later.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.926
My new stepfather, Sal,
set me up in my own business:

03:38.096 --> 03:40.064
A beauty salon.
He did it for my mother.

03:40.665 --> 03:44.658
Of course, his goons come in every week
and take 80 percent of the profits.

03:44.836 --> 03:46.098
That, he did for himself.

03:46.271 --> 03:47.533
Hey, Carbone.

03:48.774 --> 03:52.301
And Louis, the guy who saved my life,
is now my closest friend.

03:52.477 --> 03:54.809
He thinks I can do a lot better than this...

03:54.980 --> 03:57.778
...but he also thinks he looks like
Denzel Washington.

03:57.949 --> 04:01.680
Toots, I was hoping you could ask Sal
if I could keep a little extra this week...

04:01.853 --> 04:03.582
...to make improvements on the place.

04:03.755 --> 04:07.350
You wanna make improvements?
lmprove on what's in this bag next week.

04:08.827 --> 04:09.987
Look, man, I need a favor.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.926
I just got this job delivering TVs,
but my partner got sick.

04:13.131 --> 04:15.099
He had one of those
microwave chimichangas--

04:15.267 --> 04:17.531
Louis, why do all your stories
start off this way?

04:17.702 --> 04:21.433
I need your help. If I don't get these TVs
off the truck, man, I don't get paid.

04:21.873 --> 04:23.101
Oh, this sounds illegal.

04:23.375 --> 04:26.936
No, no, no. Charlie, this is totally legit, man.
I know the guy.

04:27.112 --> 04:28.477
Just like you knew the guy...

04:28.647 --> 04:31.810
...who asked you to drive
his dogs up from Florida. Remember him?

04:32.050 --> 04:35.679
I'm supposed to know a bunch of greyhounds
were being used to smuggle diamonds?

04:37.022 --> 04:41.015
Look, man, I need your help on this one.
Two hours, tops. That's all I need.

04:41.193 --> 04:44.720
-This is really important for me.
-Louis, you have a job.

04:45.030 --> 04:48.090
You call working in my uncle's
meat market a job, Charlie?

04:48.266 --> 04:50.962
I sweep up cow guts and
pig snouts all day, man!

04:51.136 --> 04:53.104
I need a job where I'm treated like a man.

04:53.271 --> 04:56.536
Where I get some respect. Ain't
that what Aretha said? "R-E-S-P-E-C-T"?

04:56.741 --> 04:59.608
Well, then, delivering TVs
is definitely the answer.

05:00.111 --> 05:03.239
I'm dying here, man. I need your help.

05:04.282 --> 05:06.546
Louis, I'm busy here.
Can't you see I'm busy?

05:06.718 --> 05:09.312
I was busy that day 20 years ago
on the beach too, man.

05:09.621 --> 05:13.352
Did that stop me from saving this skinny
little white kid from flailing in the surf?

05:13.525 --> 05:17.461
No, I stopped what I was doing, jumped
in and saved this poor little white kid.

05:18.563 --> 05:19.825
Let's go.

05:21.533 --> 05:22.522
You too easy.

05:24.603 --> 05:25.695
Hey there, Waffles.

05:25.971 --> 05:27.598
Got a kiss for your Uncle Charlie?

05:29.107 --> 05:30.699
Come on, man, what's wrong?

05:30.876 --> 05:32.173
It's just so frustrating.

05:32.344 --> 05:34.744
You don't know how difficult it is
to get anywhere...

05:34.913 --> 05:37.882
-...when Sal is your stepfather.
-He bought you the beauty salon.

05:38.049 --> 05:40.040
I barely keep enough to stay alive.

05:40.218 --> 05:43.016
If he was my stepdaddy,
you know what I'd be doing right now?

05:43.188 --> 05:45.918
I'd be:
Come on, Charlie, break it down with me.

05:46.858 --> 05:48.655
Snake it. Come on, snake it--

05:50.061 --> 05:52.052
It be a party, Charlie. Be a party.

05:53.632 --> 05:55.065
Pull over to the curb.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.292
Louis, whose truck is this?

05:57.469 --> 05:59.061
I can't be certain.

05:59.237 --> 06:00.795
This is a stolen vehicle.

06:01.339 --> 06:04.137
-Apparently, this is a stolen vehicle.
-Oh, my God.

06:04.309 --> 06:05.435
Pull over to the curb.

06:05.877 --> 06:07.708
Pull over to the curb!

06:09.948 --> 06:12.348
Louis, pull the truck over.
Just tell them the truth!

06:12.517 --> 06:14.109
-Pull the truck over!
-I can't, man!

06:14.419 --> 06:16.649
I'm still on probation from
that greyhound thing.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.278
Come on, Louis.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.316
Watch out! Here we go! Okay!

06:21.493 --> 06:23.290
You're breaking so many laws right now!

06:23.461 --> 06:26.225
If we go to jail, I'll tell
everybody you a hairdresser!

06:27.899 --> 06:29.093
Sidewalk, Louis! Sidewalk!

06:30.468 --> 06:31.935
Look out! Are you crazy!?

06:32.237 --> 06:33.704
Sorry! Excuse me!

06:33.872 --> 06:35.100
Red light!

06:47.752 --> 06:48.776
That wasn't my fault!

06:52.057 --> 06:53.684
That was my fault.

06:54.926 --> 06:56.291
Coming through!

07:07.105 --> 07:08.470
Charlie.

07:10.308 --> 07:12.299
Almost ripped my lucky jacket.

07:12.477 --> 07:15.207
What a relief. I forgot
you were wearing your lucky jacket!

07:22.053 --> 07:24.521
Big problem: Roadblock!

07:25.757 --> 07:27.315
Bigger problem!

07:28.994 --> 07:30.291
Oh, no.

07:31.730 --> 07:33.391
What're you doing? Slow down!

07:34.299 --> 07:36.893
-We're gonna make it. Hold on!
-We're not gonna make it!

07:45.810 --> 07:49.143
Now, that's what I'm talking about!
That's what I'm talking about!

07:49.314 --> 07:52.943
I think the dog just peed on my leg.
No, I think I peed on him.

07:53.118 --> 07:56.383
All units, intersection blocked.
Suspects are at large.

07:56.654 --> 08:00.021
-Just pull the truck over, I am getting out.
-You can't bail on me now!

08:00.191 --> 08:02.659
I gotta stash these TVs
until the heat cools down.

08:02.827 --> 08:05.421
Come on. We got six TVs left.

08:06.297 --> 08:08.993
Five. Come on, man, help me get this up.

08:10.068 --> 08:12.093
Hey. Is that Charlie?

08:12.804 --> 08:15.034
-Tommy?
-What're you guys doing here?

08:15.206 --> 08:18.073
-Your father didn't say you was coming.
-Sal?

08:18.243 --> 08:20.438
Yeah, this is his warehouse.

08:20.712 --> 08:22.270
-I didn't know.
-You didn't know?

08:22.447 --> 08:23.505
I didn't know!

08:24.649 --> 08:25.707
Hey!

08:26.551 --> 08:29.042
You brung the heat here, Charlie.
Are you crazy?

08:29.220 --> 08:31.313
I didn't know, Tommy!
I swear, I didn't know!

08:38.696 --> 08:39.993
Waffles, come on!

08:40.732 --> 08:42.359
-Oh, damn!
-Attention.

08:42.534 --> 08:46.231
This is the New York Police Department.
We have you surrounded.

08:46.404 --> 08:48.998
Come on, Charlie, hurry up!

08:49.841 --> 08:52.503
Waffles! She's frozen with fear!

08:52.977 --> 08:54.569
Surrender now!

08:54.746 --> 08:57.214
-Get over there! Move!
-I repeat.

08:57.382 --> 08:59.976
Come on, Louis, come on!
What is wrong with you?

09:00.151 --> 09:02.244
It's not my fault! Waffles is upset!

09:02.420 --> 09:07.380
Perhaps you should've thought of that
before you took your dog on a crime spree!

09:07.892 --> 09:09.325
Come on, girl!

09:10.995 --> 09:12.929
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

09:17.802 --> 09:19.770
Dead end, Louis. Dead end.

09:19.938 --> 09:22.429
No, it's not, Charlie. Look at this.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.234
-Think I got a way out.
-You don't even know where that goes. No!

09:26.411 --> 09:27.435
We can do this.

09:32.550 --> 09:35.144
You can stay here if you want.
I'm going down that chute!

09:35.320 --> 09:36.685
I love you, Mama!

09:42.060 --> 09:43.322
Louis?

10:02.447 --> 10:03.914
-Not over here.
-Where'd they go?

10:04.082 --> 10:07.381
We lost them. Standing by
for further instructions. Over.

10:08.286 --> 10:10.754
Anything else you'd like me
to help you with today?

10:10.922 --> 10:13.584
No, that's pretty much it.

10:17.929 --> 10:21.695
In what police are calling
one of the largest seizures of stolen goods...

10:21.866 --> 10:24.266
...in the history of New York City...

10:24.435 --> 10:30.067
...thieves inexplicably led police to a treasure
trove of stolen cars, furs, paintings--

10:31.743 --> 10:35.372
Louis Booker, you degenerate moron.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.846
Were these Medieval times
and you a knight in shining armor...

10:39.017 --> 10:42.612
...you would, I have no doubt,
slay the maiden and save the dragon.

10:44.489 --> 10:45.717
Waffles!

10:45.890 --> 10:49.291
-Sal, if we could explain--
-As for you, Charlie...

10:49.460 --> 10:51.826
...after the tragic death of your father...

10:51.996 --> 10:55.124
...l married your mother, promising her
I would raise you as my own.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.792
You chose not to take the Maggio name.
I did not complain.

10:58.970 --> 11:02.371
And when you wanted
to go to beauty school...

11:02.540 --> 11:06.442
...as boys who lose their fathers
early in life often do...

11:06.611 --> 11:09.512
...l did not snivel at your intentions, did l?

11:09.681 --> 11:12.377
-No, Salvatore, you did not. In fact--
-In fact...

11:12.550 --> 11:17.044
...l bought a beauty parlor
so you could sit on your lazy butt all day.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.846
Four and a half million you cost me.

11:20.024 --> 11:23.687
Were you anybody else,
you'd be dead by now.

11:23.861 --> 11:27.353
-Sal, we understand that you're upset.
-It's not your fault.

11:27.932 --> 11:29.229
What?

11:30.101 --> 11:33.662
A lion can raise a mouse,
but the mouse is still a mouse.

11:35.707 --> 11:39.006
And you, Charlie, are that mouse.

11:40.144 --> 11:41.805
Look at this.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.641
He takes it.

11:43.815 --> 11:45.248
Chicken blood.

11:46.818 --> 11:48.183
Excuse me, Sal?

11:48.353 --> 11:53.689
You said that he was a mouse, so that
would be mouse blood, not chicken blood.

11:53.858 --> 11:54.916
Right?

11:56.094 --> 11:58.392
Go on, Sal, I'm here if you need me.

11:58.997 --> 12:00.988
The salient point is...

12:01.165 --> 12:06.535
...l must continue to live with my lovely wife
and tears on her pillow are a plethora to me.

12:06.704 --> 12:09.468
Anathema to me!
You see what they got me doing?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.609
-I can't even talk straight!
-Take it easy.

12:11.776 --> 12:13.209
So...

12:14.879 --> 12:19.543
...l'm giving you both another chance
to redeem yourselves.

12:19.717 --> 12:22.185
-Thank you, we won't disappoint you.
-No, we won't.

12:22.353 --> 12:24.344
Of that I'm sure.

12:24.522 --> 12:25.921
Frankie....

12:27.792 --> 12:30.454
Hey, kid. Go long.

12:31.195 --> 12:34.494
Why don't you fill the boys in.
A mission of absolution.

12:34.666 --> 12:38.363
It's simple. You take this envelope
to JFK Airport...

12:38.536 --> 12:41.903
-No problem.
-...where you catch a flight for Sydney.

12:42.073 --> 12:45.338
Wow, that's--
You know, Louis has got this thing--

12:45.510 --> 12:49.446
Yeah, my mama got the gout
and if I'm not home to rub her feet...

12:49.614 --> 12:52.811
...her ankles swell up
and she can't take her house shoes off.

12:52.984 --> 12:55.612
-This really isn't much warning.
-You need a warning?

12:56.587 --> 12:58.248
-No.
-Well, then....

12:58.423 --> 13:03.486
From Sydney, you take the Old South Road
due north to a place called Coober Pedy...

13:03.661 --> 13:06.425
...where you meet a man named Mr. Smith.

13:06.597 --> 13:09.794
You give this envelope to Mr. Smith.

13:10.935 --> 13:15.304
Mr. Smith is expecting you no later
than noon, local time. You will not be late.

13:15.473 --> 13:16.906
What's in here, man?

13:17.075 --> 13:22.206
You will not look in that envelope
under any circumstances, understood?

13:22.380 --> 13:23.813
-I can't hear you--
-Understood?

13:23.981 --> 13:25.608
Oh, yeah.

13:26.417 --> 13:30.911
Should you run into any problems,
you can reach Mr. Smith at this number.

13:32.990 --> 13:34.321
Get out of here.

13:34.992 --> 13:37.961
I can't believe that stuff happened.
I'm wearing my lucky jacket.

13:38.129 --> 13:41.030
Lucky jacket? You've worn that jacket
for over 1 0 years...

13:41.199 --> 13:43.690
...and luck has never even
remotely come near you.

13:46.471 --> 13:47.495
Australia?

13:47.672 --> 13:51.130
And then they're just gonna turn
around and come right back again.

13:51.309 --> 13:53.743
-It won't be so bad.
-Yeah, why not?

13:54.178 --> 13:56.942
We're canceling their return trip.

13:58.783 --> 14:01.513
-Louis, how much time we got left?
-Fourteen hours.

14:01.686 --> 14:04.211
When is the food coming? I'm starving.

14:04.389 --> 14:07.620
Don't even worry about that.
I got you covered.

14:11.929 --> 14:13.328
Are you, like, 4 years old?

14:13.498 --> 14:16.092
If you're not hungry,
I can put these back in my pocket.

14:16.267 --> 14:19.134
Wait. I think I'll have this one.

14:19.637 --> 14:21.264
Good choice.

14:29.647 --> 14:32.548
What is that? And why is my mouth on fire?

14:32.717 --> 14:34.844
That's the new Super Atomic Jaw Buster!

14:35.019 --> 14:36.919
Extra hot!

14:38.322 --> 14:40.347
Are you trying to kill me?

14:44.762 --> 14:47.925
There's nothing wrong with this!
Stop acting like a baby!

14:49.200 --> 14:50.258
All right, let me up.

14:51.302 --> 14:54.829
-What for?
-How many things could I have to do?

14:56.174 --> 14:57.801
My bad.

15:04.882 --> 15:07.407
Hey, how are you doing?

15:07.585 --> 15:08.916
Good.

15:23.634 --> 15:24.965
Oh, my God!

15:27.738 --> 15:28.762
Charlie!

15:30.374 --> 15:33.343
-Someone's in here!
-It's me, Charlie. Open up!

15:33.511 --> 15:35.479
-What?
-Check this out.

15:35.646 --> 15:38.376
-You're not supposed to open this.
-That's, like, 50 grand.

15:38.549 --> 15:41.609
Oh, my God.
Something doesn't smell right. Look at it!

15:41.786 --> 15:43.048
I know, I'm looking!

15:43.221 --> 15:46.782
I've never seen so much green
in one little brown package!

15:46.958 --> 15:48.892
And now it's in my hands!

15:49.060 --> 15:50.550
It slipped out.

15:51.095 --> 15:52.619
Here, help me scoop it up.

15:52.797 --> 15:55.265
-This is one big load!
-What a mess!

15:55.433 --> 15:58.402
-I just want to roll around in it!
-Hand me the rest of the pile.

15:58.569 --> 16:01.037
-Can I hold it?
-No! Dump it in the envelope.

16:01.205 --> 16:03.730
-Maybe we should flush it.
-We're not gonna flush it.

16:03.908 --> 16:07.935
I'll put it in my pocket, leave this room,
and take it to Australia.

16:08.112 --> 16:11.513
If you're gonna do that, give it here.
Let me kiss it for good luck.

16:11.682 --> 16:14.344
You're not gonna kiss it!
It's bad enough you touched it!

16:14.519 --> 16:18.114
-Before you put it away, can I smell it?
-Maybe later.

16:20.224 --> 16:21.748
No, no, no.

16:21.926 --> 16:23.791
It's not what it looks like.

16:33.037 --> 16:34.026
Next, please.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.801
G'day, mate! G'day.

16:39.777 --> 16:42.746
Could you try not to draw the attention
of the entire airport?

16:42.914 --> 16:44.211
Why? What's wrong?

16:44.382 --> 16:46.646
The law states we're only allowed
to have $1 0,000.

16:46.817 --> 16:50.651
We are carrying $50,000 of mob money.

16:50.821 --> 16:53.289
If they find it, I'm anticipating conseguences.

16:53.457 --> 16:56.017
Like, perhaps, I don't know,
let's say, prison?

16:56.327 --> 16:58.386
G'day, mate!

16:58.729 --> 17:02.256
You know what? It's my fault.
I didn't keep the sentences short enough.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.424
I heard you, Charlie, all right?

17:04.602 --> 17:07.570
Now, if you're worried, give me
the money. I'll walk it through.

17:08.406 --> 17:09.430
Okay.

17:09.607 --> 17:11.939
Let me see, put my fate in your hands.

17:12.108 --> 17:14.703
This is such an agonizing decision. No.

17:15.445 --> 17:17.242
All right, then. Just remember...

17:17.415 --> 17:21.010
...the key is to act like
you don't have anything to hide, all right?

17:21.185 --> 17:22.345
Next, please.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.319
Watch the master.

17:25.323 --> 17:26.790
G'day!

17:29.026 --> 17:30.323
How are you doing?

17:30.494 --> 17:32.485
-Doing good. How are you?
-I'm all right.

17:35.499 --> 17:36.693
Hit it up top!

17:41.005 --> 17:42.734
There we go. There we go.

17:43.641 --> 17:44.699
G'day, mate.

17:48.646 --> 17:50.011
Next, please.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.109
G'day, mate.

17:58.522 --> 18:02.014
They're my hairdressing scissors.
They're my hairdressing scissors!

18:05.663 --> 18:09.030
I can....
I can explain about that money.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.898
You will explain...

18:12.703 --> 18:14.398
...$63?

18:16.040 --> 18:18.201
-Louis, I lost the money!
-What?

18:18.376 --> 18:20.367
I lost the money!
Salvatore Maggio's money!

18:20.544 --> 18:22.478
Hey, Charlie, calm down, all right?

18:22.647 --> 18:26.048
The trick is not to look suspicious.

18:26.217 --> 18:28.276
Make them watch this hand...

18:28.886 --> 18:30.911
-...instead of this one.
-Oh, my God!

18:31.555 --> 18:32.886
Had you going, didn't l?

18:33.057 --> 18:35.890
-That is not funny, Louis!
-Get in the car, baby!

18:36.961 --> 18:40.761
-They didn't have a Cadillac?
-This is the Cadillac of the Outback.

19:06.857 --> 19:11.226
You know, Charlie, this mysterious
Mr. Smith we're gonna meet?

19:12.730 --> 19:15.961
-I don't think that's his real name.
-Nothing escapes you, Louis.

19:16.901 --> 19:18.835
What's eating you, man?

19:19.804 --> 19:22.602
Don't tell me this is about
that girl on the plane.

19:22.773 --> 19:25.333
-No, it's more than that.
-Coober Pedy! Right here!

19:26.677 --> 19:29.646
I got it. Here we go. Here we go.

19:30.247 --> 19:32.841
Let's face it, I'm never
gonna find the right girl.

19:33.017 --> 19:35.417
You gotta stop it with this "never" stuff.

19:35.586 --> 19:39.386
Two days ago, we never thought
we'd be in Australia, but we here!

19:43.994 --> 19:46.861
-Come on, give me a beat.
-Come on, play with the radio.

19:47.031 --> 19:50.933
Come on, man! I want to play with you.
Give me a beat, man!

20:26.537 --> 20:29.165
-What the hell?
-My God.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.042
I killed a kangaroo.

20:35.379 --> 20:37.006
I never saw it.

20:38.048 --> 20:39.675
It's such a beautiful animal.

20:39.850 --> 20:42.375
It's the national symbol of Australia...

20:42.553 --> 20:44.282
-...and I killed it.
-Don't worry.

20:44.455 --> 20:48.414
I read that the kangaroos are
the rodents of the Outback. We cool!

20:48.592 --> 20:52.028
-Shouldn't we bury it or something?
-My uncle has one rule:

20:52.196 --> 20:54.892
Whenever you hit something,
keep on rolling. So let's roll.

20:55.065 --> 20:57.727
I can't leave it there.
I got to pull it off to the side.

20:57.902 --> 20:59.927
You pulling by yourself, then.

21:00.104 --> 21:02.800
God, I am so sorry, little buddy.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.668
Charlie, don't move. Stay right there.

21:08.846 --> 21:11.371
Louis, what are you doing? Louis?

21:11.549 --> 21:13.676
You guys look so adorable.

21:14.251 --> 21:16.412
-G'day, mate!
-Stop that, Louis.

21:16.854 --> 21:18.685
Hey, Charlie, hold on!
Hold on, hold on.

21:18.856 --> 21:20.414
You know who he looks like?

21:20.591 --> 21:22.252
Jackie Legs!

21:22.793 --> 21:26.092
Jackie Legs from Canarsie with the goatee!
Always wears sunglasses!

21:26.263 --> 21:28.561
-What are you talking about?
-Hold on. Look.

21:29.466 --> 21:31.661
Okay, look at it.
Right there. Look at that.

21:33.270 --> 21:35.067
Jeez, that is Jackie Legs.

21:38.342 --> 21:40.606
All right, Louis, enough.
Help me here.

21:42.146 --> 21:44.046
It's lucky jacket time.

21:45.549 --> 21:48.950
Come on, Louis, have some respect.
It's bad enough we ran him over.

21:54.124 --> 21:56.718
Come on, just one picture
for the Brooklyn crew.

21:56.894 --> 21:58.623
All right, one.

21:58.796 --> 22:01.765
-But let's make this guick.
-Stay up there, big boy.

22:01.932 --> 22:03.957
Say "cheese."

22:04.835 --> 22:08.327
All right, come on, let's get this jacket off.
We got things to do, Louis.

22:09.039 --> 22:11.405
Hey, come on, Charlie. One more.

22:12.877 --> 22:15.471
This could be our Christmas card.

22:18.349 --> 22:21.284
-Louis.
-What? What?

22:29.293 --> 22:30.282
Charlie.

22:32.830 --> 22:34.229
Jeez!

22:35.933 --> 22:37.195
Hey, look.

22:38.235 --> 22:40.703
-We didn't hurt him after all.
-It looked like we did.

22:42.706 --> 22:44.901
You're a tough little guy, aren't you?

22:48.112 --> 22:50.512
Hey, look how tall he is.

22:58.789 --> 23:00.086
You all right, dog? Come on, come on!

23:05.796 --> 23:08.890
I just got my ass kicked by a marsupial!

23:12.736 --> 23:15.330
-You want to know the best part?
-What?

23:15.506 --> 23:19.408
Now I never have to see
that stupid red jacket of yours again!

23:30.654 --> 23:31.678
Charlie?

23:32.323 --> 23:33.790
-Charlie!
-What?

23:33.958 --> 23:36.586
The kangaroo got the money.

23:39.363 --> 23:41.354
What are you talking about?

23:41.532 --> 23:45.161
I put the money in the jacket
and the jacket on the kangaroo...

23:45.336 --> 23:48.134
...and now he hopping away.

23:51.041 --> 23:52.906
The kangaroo has the money?

23:55.446 --> 23:59.109
The kangaroo has
Salvatore Maggio's $50,000?

24:00.684 --> 24:02.117
Yeah.

24:12.963 --> 24:15.625
Who puts a jacket
with 50,000 on a kangaroo?

24:15.799 --> 24:18.666
A dead kangaroo! He was dead, Charlie!

24:20.804 --> 24:23.773
You should have just let me drown, Louis,
I mean it!

24:27.945 --> 24:30.778
-I see you now, sucker!
-Go, go, go! We got him! Go!

24:32.783 --> 24:35.684
Look at that little fellow go, Charlie!
Look at him go!

24:45.929 --> 24:48.989
Here we come, baby!
We gaining on him! Oh, my God.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.532
Look at the fellow move, man.

24:56.173 --> 24:58.334
I'm gonna pull up.
Reach out and grab the money!

24:58.509 --> 25:01.808
You want me to open the door
and lean out of a speeding car!

25:01.979 --> 25:05.471
Fine, Charlie! We'll just drive past him
and hope he hops in the jeep!

25:07.851 --> 25:09.478
-Here I go!
-Okay.

25:10.487 --> 25:12.045
-Here I go.
-Lean out there, baby!

25:12.222 --> 25:13.712
Get me closer. Get me closer!

25:13.891 --> 25:15.859
-He's hopping like a rabbit!
-Closer!

25:16.026 --> 25:18.153
-Get me closer!
-I'm trying to get closer!

25:18.862 --> 25:20.796
-Come on! Get him, baby!
-Closer, Louis!

25:20.964 --> 25:25.196
-Get the money, Charlie!
-Closer, Louis! I almost got it!

25:25.369 --> 25:28.202
-I'm almost there!
-Come on, Charlie! I can't hold on!

25:29.173 --> 25:30.800
Get the money!

25:35.779 --> 25:37.508
As it turns out, this is hard.

25:42.086 --> 25:43.348
What are these things?

25:43.520 --> 25:46.546
They're termite mounds!
I read about them in the book!

25:46.723 --> 25:49.055
Careful, you almost missed one!

25:51.061 --> 25:53.791
-You mine now, sucker!
-Yeah!

25:56.967 --> 25:59.367
Go, go, go!

26:00.571 --> 26:02.095
Stop, stop, stop!

26:17.121 --> 26:19.453
I don't suppose you took the insurance?

26:21.792 --> 26:24.260
My uncle always told me
that was just a rip-off.

26:32.302 --> 26:35.362
Don't worry, Charlie.
We'll get the money back, all right?

26:35.539 --> 26:36.699
It can't go far.

26:36.874 --> 26:39.604
It's a continent, Louis. He can go very far.

26:39.776 --> 26:42.609
I know it's a continent. I read the book.

26:42.779 --> 26:47.045
You happen to read the chapter on
not putting your jacket on a wild animal?

26:49.119 --> 26:52.452
No, but I read one on how an aboriginal
can kill a white man with a twig.

26:52.623 --> 26:53.715
You wanna see that one?

27:27.558 --> 27:28.991
The Old Alice lnn.

27:29.159 --> 27:32.424
I'll buy you a beer and we'll catch
the end of the Knicks game.

27:35.232 --> 27:37.132
Two beers. Big beers.

27:38.969 --> 27:42.097
I'm gonna call Mr. Smith, let him know
there's been a slight delay.

27:42.272 --> 27:43.830
-Slight delay?
-Yeah.

27:44.007 --> 27:46.669
But we're working on it, all right?
Give me his number.

27:49.947 --> 27:52.040
-Where's your phone?
-Around near the dunnies.

27:52.950 --> 27:55.180
-You guys have a Denny's?
-No, the dunny.

27:56.353 --> 27:58.685
The bog trough? The long drop?

27:59.256 --> 28:01.281
-The thunder box?
-You know what?

28:01.458 --> 28:03.449
I'm just gonna look for it by the bathroom.

28:10.767 --> 28:12.826
Now, there's a Yank that can drink.

28:14.304 --> 28:17.239
Any Yank that can drink is all right with me.

28:18.508 --> 28:20.806
G'day. My name is Blue.

28:21.945 --> 28:24.539
-Charlie.
-Nice to meet you, Chaza.

28:25.349 --> 28:28.409
-Charlie.
-That's what I said, Chaza.

28:29.519 --> 28:31.214
We're only two hours late.

28:32.222 --> 28:34.986
He should be a reasonable
and understanding man.

28:37.094 --> 28:38.925
-What?
-Mr. Smith?

28:39.096 --> 28:43.192
-Yeah, you might not know me, but--
-Where are you bludgers?

28:43.734 --> 28:46.999
I'm out here in the back of Bullamakanka
up to me ears in heat stroke...

28:47.170 --> 28:48.899
...waiting for you two Yanks.

28:49.072 --> 28:50.972
Where's me package?

28:51.975 --> 28:55.069
It's been temporarily misplaced.

28:55.245 --> 28:57.475
I don't reckon you respect me very much.

28:57.648 --> 29:00.276
First you steal my package
and now you're on the phone...

29:00.450 --> 29:01.576
...razzing me about it.

29:01.752 --> 29:04.880
We didn't steal your package.
I swear! We're gonna get it back!

29:05.055 --> 29:08.286
You'd be a banger short of a barbie
if you didn't, when I find you!

29:08.458 --> 29:10.688
You better get ready
to cough it up...

29:10.861 --> 29:14.092
...otherwise, I'll chop you into snags
and feed you to the crocs.

29:14.264 --> 29:16.232
-Mr. Smith?
-Have a nice day.

29:19.703 --> 29:21.603
One of me favorites.

29:29.413 --> 29:32.211
A kangaroo. A kangaroo.
Kangaroo....

29:32.382 --> 29:33.781
Wildlife Foundation.

29:37.020 --> 29:40.956
-Louis, this is Blue. Blue, this is Louis.
-Hey, Blue.

29:41.124 --> 29:44.651
-What'd Mr. Smith say?
-He was nice.

29:44.828 --> 29:47.058
-He said everything was cool.
-Really?

29:47.230 --> 29:50.529
He did say that we should do our best
to get the package back.

29:50.701 --> 29:54.034
-Right. The package.
-The package!

29:55.238 --> 29:56.296
Charlie?

29:56.473 --> 29:58.941
Order me another drink. I got a plan.

30:04.181 --> 30:05.307
This isn't my day.

30:12.589 --> 30:14.523
You mind leaving a little for the camels?

30:16.593 --> 30:17.582
You're American.

30:17.761 --> 30:20.958
And you're drinking water
that comes from a stagnant pond.

30:21.131 --> 30:23.861
I'm from Brooklyn. I've had a lot worse.

30:24.034 --> 30:26.002
-My name is Louis.
-Name's Jessie.

30:26.169 --> 30:28.694
-Nice to meet you.
-Wanna give me a hand?

30:29.272 --> 30:30.569
Okay.

30:33.143 --> 30:36.806
No offense, but these are
the ugliest rabbits I've ever seen.

30:36.980 --> 30:39.642
They're called bilbies.
They're almost extinct.

30:39.816 --> 30:44.446
In fact, it's up to these guys to repopulate
the entire Devil's Marbles area.

30:44.621 --> 30:47.317
Somebody's gonna be having fun tonight!

30:47.491 --> 30:48.753
That's the plan.

30:48.925 --> 30:51.155
Looks like you'll need more bilbies, though.

30:51.328 --> 30:54.297
Well, if the foundation I work for
had more money....

30:55.432 --> 30:57.457
You mean the Wildlife Foundation?

30:57.834 --> 31:00.132
-You work here?
-Yeah.

31:00.637 --> 31:03.936
Thank you, Lord! This is great!
I need some help.

31:04.107 --> 31:06.632
I put my lucky jacket
on the back of a dead kangaroo...

31:06.810 --> 31:09.176
...who came to life
and hopped off with my money.

31:09.346 --> 31:12.144
-You do need help.
-No, no, no, I'm for real.

31:12.315 --> 31:13.543
Can you help me?

31:14.251 --> 31:16.412
Do you have any idea where he is?

31:16.720 --> 31:17.709
No.

31:17.888 --> 31:21.346
It seems to me you need an airplane.
You need a tranguilizer gun....

31:23.460 --> 31:25.155
You need a list.

31:54.424 --> 31:58.053
Come on, come on, come on!
He's got it!

32:01.364 --> 32:02.888
Charlie! Charlie!

32:03.533 --> 32:05.228
Come here, man. Come here!

32:05.402 --> 32:07.233
Give me one sec, guys.

32:07.938 --> 32:10.270
You've gotta see this guy drink!
He's unbelievable!

32:10.440 --> 32:12.874
I figured out how to catch that kangaroo.

32:13.043 --> 32:16.171
First we hit it with a car and
now you want to blow its head off?

32:16.346 --> 32:17.779
No.

32:17.948 --> 32:22.180
This is a tranguilizer dart.
It works in three stages.

32:22.352 --> 32:26.652
Stage one: Temporary blindness.
Stage two: Partial paralysis.

32:26.823 --> 32:29.815
And stage three: Complete
shutdown of all motor skills.

32:29.993 --> 32:32.120
-Totally humane.
-Sounds humane.

32:32.295 --> 32:34.160
I said it was temporary.

32:34.331 --> 32:37.789
I walked to this wildlife office
and this American girl that works there...

32:37.968 --> 32:40.129
...and she is....

32:50.013 --> 32:51.002
Epileptic?

32:51.181 --> 32:52.546
Her name is Jessie.

32:52.716 --> 32:55.549
I told her the story and showed her
a photo of the kangaroo.

32:55.719 --> 32:58.119
You told her the kangaroo has $50,000?

32:58.288 --> 33:02.622
I told her the kangaroo has $4000
and our passports.

33:02.792 --> 33:04.157
Not bad.

33:04.327 --> 33:07.763
She told me the best way
to find a kangaroo is by air.

33:07.931 --> 33:09.159
What's that?

33:09.332 --> 33:11.323
A number to a bush plane that we can hire.

33:11.902 --> 33:14.302
-I like it.
-Let's go call.

33:19.175 --> 33:22.076
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say this is a honey of a plan.

33:22.245 --> 33:23.974
Dang skippy.

33:27.217 --> 33:28.809
Excuse me, mates.

33:28.985 --> 33:31.385
Gotta point Percy at the porcelain.

33:34.157 --> 33:36.091
Gee, almost made it.

33:40.564 --> 33:42.464
Pilot's personal number.

33:58.615 --> 34:00.048
Louis?

34:01.751 --> 34:03.184
Do you have a backup plan?

34:07.223 --> 34:11.592
I sure hope the two pots of coffee
and the Red Bull we gave him were enough!

34:11.761 --> 34:13.695
Hey, man! How're you doing up there?

34:13.862 --> 34:16.456
Never better, mate!
Why do you ask?

34:16.632 --> 34:20.228
No reason. It's just that you
were passed out an hour ago.

34:20.402 --> 34:22.234
That's just me morning ritual, mate.

34:26.109 --> 34:28.873
I couldn't help but notice
that this is the Flying Dingo IV.

34:29.646 --> 34:31.409
What happened to the l, Il and Ill?

34:41.157 --> 34:43.920
Now use the word in a sentence.

34:44.761 --> 34:50.495
Amorphous: Having no definite form.
Shapeless, as in:

34:50.667 --> 34:54.534
"After Joey Clams got whacked,
his head was amorphous."

34:54.704 --> 34:57.434
That was excellent.
Now let's move to the next level.

34:57.974 --> 34:59.965
I think you should take this.

35:01.745 --> 35:02.734
Hello.

35:06.816 --> 35:09.284
I'm aggrieved to hear that, Mr. Smith.

35:10.487 --> 35:12.387
Of course we had a deal.

35:12.989 --> 35:17.483
Please, advise me if this situation changes.

35:19.729 --> 35:21.890
Those two mammalucco didn't show.

35:22.399 --> 35:25.129
Our friend feels they pocketed the 50 G's.

35:25.301 --> 35:26.996
Maybe they figured it out.

35:27.170 --> 35:29.502
My stepson couldn't figure out
a cheese sandwich...

35:29.673 --> 35:32.267
...if they spotted him the pumpernickel
and the provolone.

35:33.910 --> 35:35.172
So, what do you want to do?

35:36.179 --> 35:37.942
You possess a valid passport.

35:41.885 --> 35:44.012
I can't see anything from up here.

35:44.187 --> 35:46.849
Hey, do you think you can
take us down a little lower?

35:47.023 --> 35:49.617
Hang on to your knickers,
we're going in!

35:52.962 --> 35:55.658
A little lower! A little lower!

36:00.370 --> 36:03.066
Look out for that tree!

36:06.509 --> 36:09.000
Could you please not do that again?
Thank you!

36:09.512 --> 36:11.673
Hey, Charlie!
Look to the left!

36:12.248 --> 36:13.806
Kangaroos!

36:13.983 --> 36:17.384
They're kangaroos, all right!
A lot of kangaroos!

36:18.088 --> 36:21.182
None with a red jacket.
You think he could be someplace else?

36:21.357 --> 36:22.346
Wait!

36:22.525 --> 36:25.323
-Look, look, it's Jackie Legs!
-There he is!

36:25.495 --> 36:28.123
-That's him, that's him!
-I knew this would work!

36:28.498 --> 36:31.661
-Blue, bring us around!
-Yeah, right!

36:36.005 --> 36:37.063
Get me there, Blue!

36:46.549 --> 36:50.747
Get up right on his tail
and stay with him no matter what!

36:53.223 --> 36:55.054
Say hello to my little friend!

36:57.794 --> 37:00.262
I got you now, Jackie Legs!

37:00.830 --> 37:03.060
I'm gonna get you now.

37:07.670 --> 37:09.035
You hit him?

37:09.839 --> 37:11.670
I don't know.
He's still hopping.

37:11.841 --> 37:13.741
Maybe it takes time
for it to take effect.

37:13.910 --> 37:15.844
Yeah, all right.

37:17.647 --> 37:19.114
Charlie?

37:21.751 --> 37:23.082
Oh, my God.

37:23.253 --> 37:25.414
-Mates?
-Yes?

37:25.588 --> 37:29.422
Got a bit of a wrinkle here.
The old optics are on the fritz.

37:29.592 --> 37:33.119
Stage one: Temporary blindness.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.867
-Was that the engine?!
-No.

37:39.035 --> 37:41.697
That was me. For some reason,
I can't move me arms.

37:41.871 --> 37:45.068
Stage two: Partial paralysis!

37:45.642 --> 37:48.270
Charlie, can you lean over
and take the stick?

37:48.444 --> 37:50.412
I can still work the foot pedals.

37:50.580 --> 37:53.242
-Oh, God!
-Take the stick firmly in hand and--

37:56.553 --> 37:58.612
-Blue!
-Stage three:

37:58.788 --> 38:00.949
Total shutdown of motor skills!

38:02.225 --> 38:04.159
English, Blue, English!

38:04.661 --> 38:06.424
Stage four:

38:07.096 --> 38:09.223
Fiery crash!

38:57.413 --> 38:58.505
You okay?

38:58.681 --> 38:59.670
-Yeah.
-You sure?

38:59.849 --> 39:01.248
-Yeah.
-Good.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.112
'Cause I am gonna beat you soft!

39:03.286 --> 39:05.550
-Like this is my fault?
-First rule of aviation:

39:05.722 --> 39:07.121
You never shoot the pilot!

39:07.290 --> 39:09.451
Assume crash positions!

39:10.026 --> 39:11.960
Blue, we already crashed.

39:14.163 --> 39:16.063
Right. No worries, then.

39:24.974 --> 39:26.271
Can I help you?

39:26.442 --> 39:29.411
Think some friends of mine
passed through here.

39:29.579 --> 39:31.444
A couple of Yanks?

39:32.649 --> 39:34.549
-Friends?
-Yeah.

39:35.151 --> 39:38.314
I promised the family back home
I'd take care of them.

39:39.689 --> 39:41.486
Hello? Hello?

39:41.658 --> 39:43.888
Come on, Blue, you got to
do something, man.

39:45.194 --> 39:46.889
Hello? Hello?

39:47.597 --> 39:49.224
Charlie, we gotta do something.

39:49.399 --> 39:50.388
What can we do?

39:50.566 --> 39:54.832
We have to hope Santa Claus over there
can fix the radio or someone looks for us.

39:55.505 --> 39:59.032
Actually, someone is looking for us.

40:01.444 --> 40:02.570
Mr. Smith.

40:04.881 --> 40:06.815
-Louis!
-He didn't say...

40:06.983 --> 40:08.177
...what I said he said.

40:08.351 --> 40:10.717
What did he say
that you didn't say he said?

40:10.887 --> 40:14.015
He thinks we stole his package, man,
so he's coming after us.

40:14.524 --> 40:18.119
He mentioned cutting us up into little
bitty pieces and snacks for a crocodile.

40:18.294 --> 40:19.454
Then the phone went out--

40:19.629 --> 40:22.894
If Smith thinks we stole his money,
then by now Sal thinks we stole it.

40:23.066 --> 40:25.796
Sal's not gonna hurt us.
He's married to your mother.

40:26.269 --> 40:27.930
If Sal thinks we stole his money...

40:28.104 --> 40:30.868
...he'll kill us in front of her,
then make her clean it up.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.975
All we have to do is find the money
before Mr. Smith finds us...

40:34.143 --> 40:35.371
...and everything is okay.

40:35.545 --> 40:38.207
So what you're saying is that
we should find the money.

40:38.381 --> 40:40.042
-Yes.
-How, Louis? How?

40:40.216 --> 40:43.014
How are we gonna catch a kangaroo on foot?

40:47.957 --> 40:49.288
Got it.

40:49.525 --> 40:51.117
You ever heard of Devil's Marbles?

40:51.294 --> 40:53.592
Due east. Bit of a walk, though.

40:53.763 --> 40:55.390
Why, what's there?

40:55.565 --> 40:57.965
The lady I told you about
at the wildlife office.

40:58.134 --> 40:59.465
-The epileptic?
-Yes.

40:59.635 --> 41:02.729
She works with animals and I bet
she can help us catch Jackie Legs.

41:02.905 --> 41:04.896
-Please!
-Charlie.

41:05.074 --> 41:07.872
It's better than being cut up
into little bitty pieces, man.

41:08.044 --> 41:09.909
Not if you go first and I get to watch.

41:10.546 --> 41:14.448
Look out, you blokes go ahead.
I'll fix the radio, be right with you.

41:15.952 --> 41:19.149
-Which way is east, man?
-That way.

41:19.856 --> 41:21.824
-Let's go, man.
-No, no, wait there.

41:22.425 --> 41:23.483
That way.

41:25.962 --> 41:27.589
Charlie?

41:28.531 --> 41:30.328
I'm worried about Waffles.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.866
Do you think she'll be okay with Sal?

41:33.036 --> 41:34.025
Oh, sure.

41:34.203 --> 41:37.001
As long as she doesn't dig up
any bodies in the back yard...

41:37.173 --> 41:40.506
-...she should be just fine.
-Good.

41:41.811 --> 41:44.245
How far did Blue say this place was?

41:44.414 --> 41:47.383
He didn't. He just said it was due east.

41:47.550 --> 41:49.518
So is Brooklyn.

41:56.793 --> 41:58.954
-You're the guide?
-Yes, sir.

41:59.128 --> 42:02.757
My name Mr. Jimmy.
First-rate, expert Outback guide.

42:02.932 --> 42:04.991
You'll be most happy with me.

42:05.334 --> 42:07.165
Great freaking start.

42:08.037 --> 42:10.835
Hey, listen, you know where we can
get some guns around here?

42:11.007 --> 42:13.168
No worries. You boys hunters?

42:14.510 --> 42:16.603
Yeah, hunters.

42:18.581 --> 42:22.813
I think I just sweated out a bottle of Yoo-Hoo
I drank in the eighth grade.

42:24.787 --> 42:27.085
Be cool. Dingoes.

42:29.459 --> 42:31.359
Hey, that one kind of looks like Waffles.

42:31.527 --> 42:35.327
Yeah, if Waffles had a crazed look
in his eyes and his face caked in blood.

42:36.032 --> 42:37.260
Charlie?

42:37.433 --> 42:39.901
Why are they staring at me like that?

42:40.069 --> 42:43.835
Because I'm a green leaf salad
and you're the all-you-can-eat buffet.

42:46.275 --> 42:49.767
You gotta help me out, man.
They gonna get me like they got that baby!

42:52.281 --> 42:54.112
Feel that? Wind suddenly picked up.

42:54.283 --> 42:56.979
It's like all of a sudden
the air conditioner's fixed.

42:58.254 --> 43:00.119
Charlie, where are the dingoes going?

43:00.756 --> 43:03.589
I think something bad
is about to happen here, Louis.

43:03.759 --> 43:06.284
Hey, Charlie, look.

43:08.664 --> 43:11.189
This feels good! I feel like I can fly.

43:11.367 --> 43:12.994
Louis!

43:14.070 --> 43:16.231
-Louis!
-I believe I can fly!

43:18.274 --> 43:22.870
Louis, I wanna go back to Brooklyn!

43:25.148 --> 43:26.410
Come in, Tansy, over.

43:26.983 --> 43:28.473
Read you, over.

43:28.885 --> 43:30.318
Boy, am I glad to hear you.

43:30.486 --> 43:33.148
Listen, I've crashed me plane.
Can you send some help?

43:33.322 --> 43:35.222
Your location, over.

43:35.391 --> 43:39.885
It's west of the Simpson
and just south of King's Canyon.

43:43.432 --> 43:44.797
Tansy?

43:44.967 --> 43:46.400
You read me, Tansy?

43:47.803 --> 43:49.065
Tansy?

43:50.606 --> 43:52.073
Do you read me?

43:53.442 --> 43:56.707
Must have been
some kind of freak sand storm.

43:56.879 --> 43:57.937
Think so?

43:58.114 --> 43:59.843
I think you need to eat.

44:00.449 --> 44:02.246
Your blood sugar's getting low.

44:02.919 --> 44:05.911
Stop it, Louis. Okay? Please, just stop it.

44:06.455 --> 44:09.049
You know what I could really go for
right about now?

44:09.225 --> 44:11.785
Some Roscoe's chicken and waffles...

44:11.961 --> 44:14.429
...with a side of grits and a side of gravy.

44:14.597 --> 44:16.690
I'm not listening to you.

44:16.866 --> 44:18.163
Or better yet...

44:18.334 --> 44:21.565
...one of those iced mocha-schmoca
things from Starbucks.

44:21.737 --> 44:24.934
They're so cold and creamy.

44:25.575 --> 44:27.304
My God.

44:36.519 --> 44:38.316
Can you believe this?

44:38.487 --> 44:40.614
Can you believe our luck?

44:41.090 --> 44:43.320
What are the chances?

44:45.261 --> 44:47.092
It's a miracle!

44:48.731 --> 44:50.665
Oh, yeah!

44:56.572 --> 44:57.869
Tunes!

45:04.747 --> 45:07.580
Hey, Louis, what are you waiting for?

45:08.651 --> 45:10.812
Come on, hop in.

45:12.622 --> 45:13.919
Hey, look.

45:15.124 --> 45:17.991
-They got Slurpees.
-Oh, Charlie.

45:22.832 --> 45:24.766
Brain freeze!

45:28.304 --> 45:30.431
It seemed so real.

45:31.507 --> 45:33.031
That's why they call it a mirage.

45:33.943 --> 45:36.411
At least you got to have fun
for a few minutes.

45:36.579 --> 45:42.017
Yeah, because my brain is frying,
and I'm losing contact with reality.

45:42.184 --> 45:46.450
You don't understand this
because this is how you usually function.

45:48.190 --> 45:50.852
-That was uncalled for, Charlie.
-Was it?

45:52.428 --> 45:55.363
Every decision you make, Louis, is a disaster.

45:55.531 --> 45:58.466
That's right, Charlie, just blame me.

45:58.634 --> 46:01.865
That way you relieve yourself
of all responsibility.

46:02.038 --> 46:03.733
But let me tell you something...

46:03.906 --> 46:07.740
...it's easier to mock than to do,
and you do nothing.

46:07.910 --> 46:11.209
You just complain and whine like a woman.

46:12.181 --> 46:14.308
You want to see me do something?

46:14.784 --> 46:16.411
Bring it on, gueen of the desert.

46:37.239 --> 46:40.572
Louis. Louis, wait a second.

46:40.743 --> 46:43.109
I'm having another one of those mirages.

46:43.279 --> 46:44.803
And this one's a beauty.

46:58.427 --> 47:00.054
Charlie.

47:01.030 --> 47:04.466
Louis, please. Let me just enjoy this.

47:20.349 --> 47:21.714
How you doing?

47:21.884 --> 47:24.682
-Good. You?
-Good.

47:36.298 --> 47:39.825
Louis, they feel so real.

00:09.288 --> 00:10.983
-It's you.
-Yeah, it's me.

00:11.156 --> 00:12.623
Love the jacket, Charlie.

00:12.791 --> 00:16.192
It's hard to get something
that fits my shoulders. Nice!

00:16.361 --> 00:18.522
How'd you know red was my favorite color?

00:18.697 --> 00:19.891
You can talk!

00:20.065 --> 00:21.930
And I can sing.

00:29.308 --> 00:30.297
This is great.

00:36.148 --> 00:38.639
Jackie? Mr. Legs?

00:38.817 --> 00:42.014
If you could find your way clear
to give me back my money....

00:42.187 --> 00:43.176
Money?

00:43.355 --> 00:46.688
Oh, you mean that money!

00:48.927 --> 00:49.916
Stop that!

00:50.095 --> 00:51.084
Stop that!

00:52.097 --> 00:54.224
Stop that! Hey! Stop that, please!

00:54.399 --> 00:55.764
If Sal finds out--

00:56.401 --> 01:00.167
If I find out what, Charlie?
That you lost my money?

01:00.739 --> 01:03.367
-Sal?
-I ask you to do something for me.

01:03.542 --> 01:04.839
This is not that!

01:05.010 --> 01:08.207
-It wasn't my fault, it was Louis.
-Say what? My fault?

01:08.380 --> 01:11.008
That's how you pay me back
after I saved your life?

01:11.183 --> 01:13.777
-Louis?
-Next time you're drowning in the ocean...

01:13.952 --> 01:17.012
...call Free Willy!
Let Willy set you free!

01:17.889 --> 01:20.881
You know what, Sal?
You were right about him.

01:21.059 --> 01:23.584
-Chicken blood!
-Smell it on his father.

01:23.762 --> 01:26.026
-Smell it on him.
-Chicken blood.

01:26.198 --> 01:28.428
-Chicken blood!
-Chicken blood!

01:40.045 --> 01:41.376
Here.

01:41.546 --> 01:43.138
Drink this.

01:43.315 --> 01:45.146
It'll bring down the swelling.

01:46.718 --> 01:49.744
Unfortunately, it'll also make
your testicles fall off.

01:53.492 --> 01:54.584
I'm kidding.

01:57.963 --> 02:00.056
It won't bring down the swelling.

02:16.815 --> 02:18.646
About bloody time.

02:23.121 --> 02:25.988
-Where are they?
-Piss off!

02:26.158 --> 02:29.559
Fifteen years Special Air Services,
behind the line!

02:29.728 --> 02:33.027
I'm down and out, mate.
I forgot more than you ever learned.

02:33.198 --> 02:35.189
You'll get nothing from me!

02:35.367 --> 02:36.891
Devil's Marbles.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.094
Took off on foot, about ten hours ago.

02:39.271 --> 02:41.501
See, that wasn't so difficult.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.674
Knock-knock.

02:51.850 --> 02:54.182
-Very funny.
-Can't be too careful.

02:55.821 --> 02:57.846
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

02:58.023 --> 03:00.048
I didn't think they were real.

03:00.592 --> 03:02.822
Oh, no! I mean,
I thought they were real--

03:02.994 --> 03:06.054
Relax, I know what you mean.
Louis explained.

03:07.999 --> 03:10.797
Listen, Louis and I have a little problem--

03:10.969 --> 03:13.597
And I already told him,
I can't help you find your roo.

03:13.772 --> 03:16.536
I've got to get back to Alice Springs. Sorry.

03:17.609 --> 03:19.133
That's okay.

03:19.311 --> 03:20.505
I understand.

03:26.218 --> 03:28.550
-What?
-Look...

03:28.720 --> 03:33.384
...Louis told me you need some money
to repopulate the earth with your rabbits.

03:33.558 --> 03:34.718
Bilbies.

03:34.893 --> 03:36.292
Bilbies.

03:37.062 --> 03:40.395
How about this, we give you $2000...

03:40.565 --> 03:42.658
...you help us get our stuff back.

03:42.834 --> 03:46.270
-Two thousand dollars?
-Strictly business, no strings attached.

03:46.438 --> 03:48.668
-What do you say? We got a deal?
-Deal.

03:49.474 --> 03:50.964
Great. Hustle makes it happen.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.008
-Let's get moving.
-Now?

03:53.512 --> 03:56.709
You see, our passports are just
about to expire--

03:56.882 --> 04:00.875
Nine of the ten most poisonous snakes
in the world live in Australia.

04:01.052 --> 04:03.520
And they all come out at night.

04:04.122 --> 04:06.352
How do you feel about a morning start?

04:12.998 --> 04:17.059
Doesn't get any better than this, Louis.
Blue skies, fresh air!

04:17.235 --> 04:19.795
And who even knew
there were camels in Australia?

04:19.971 --> 04:23.964
These are noble beasts, my friend.
Proud, majestic--

04:28.146 --> 04:30.944
Get used to it, boys. Camels do that.

04:32.551 --> 04:35.577
I don't want to seem nosy,
but do you have some sort of plan here?

04:35.754 --> 04:37.881
There hasn't been rain for weeks, right?

04:39.825 --> 04:42.521
-Oh, God.
-Come on!

04:43.094 --> 04:46.996
When the water dries up in the basins,
the kangaroos head for the rivers.

04:48.767 --> 04:51.793
So that means we have two choices,
the Finke River or the Todd.

04:51.970 --> 04:55.428
Since the Finke is 200 hundred miles away,
I'm leaning toward the Todd.

04:55.607 --> 04:57.973
-Alrighty, then, to the Todd.
-To the Todd.

04:58.143 --> 04:59.770
To the Todd!

05:00.412 --> 05:03.779
Louis, what are you eating?
I picked a bunch of berries at camp.

05:03.949 --> 05:06.042
Jessie said they were cool.

05:06.218 --> 05:09.847
They smell just like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles
right before you add the milk.

05:10.021 --> 05:12.182
-Go on, take a whiff.
-No, thank you.

05:17.762 --> 05:20.731
-Give me some of those berries real guick!
-Go on, take some.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.431
Man, these do smell pretty good.

05:26.605 --> 05:29.369
Chicks in New York, they'd pay big money
to smell like that.

05:29.541 --> 05:31.975
They're called snakeskin lily berries. Tut!

05:32.510 --> 05:34.978
Impressive. How long you been in Australia?

05:35.146 --> 05:38.604
I moved here with a friend from Milwaukee
three years ago for a semester...

05:38.783 --> 05:40.478
-...and never went back.
-Milwaukee!

05:40.652 --> 05:42.381
You know, I once had a--

05:46.558 --> 05:49.118
What is with these camels?

05:50.295 --> 05:52.422
That one was me.

05:54.266 --> 05:59.203
I swear to God we passed that same bush
two hours ago. What is going on?

05:59.371 --> 06:02.340
-Well, it says here--
-What, again with the map?

06:02.507 --> 06:05.271
Why don't you sit on your head,
try thinking with your butt.

06:05.443 --> 06:06.637
Hey, Frankie, look!

06:07.078 --> 06:09.706
Maybe this hump can tell us where we are.

06:11.883 --> 06:13.180
How are you doing?

06:13.351 --> 06:17.378
Got trangued, crashed me plane, rescue
party knocked me out and left me to die.

06:17.555 --> 06:19.455
All because of a bloody boomer.

06:21.326 --> 06:23.954
We're looking for Alice Springs.

06:24.729 --> 06:27.857
Heading straight for it, mate.
What about a lift?

06:28.033 --> 06:30.866
-Why not? Get in.
-Beauty.

06:34.906 --> 06:36.874
So what do you think?

06:37.575 --> 06:39.668
No wonder the kangaroos come here.

06:40.545 --> 06:41.534
Come on.

06:43.248 --> 06:44.772
This looks like a good spot.

06:44.950 --> 06:48.784
If there's a kangaroo within 500 miles,
he'll show up here eventually.

06:49.387 --> 06:52.720
So when our guy shows up,
how are we gonna catch him?

06:52.891 --> 06:55.257
You know what?
I've been thinking about that.

06:58.129 --> 06:59.756
Have you ever thrown a bolo?

07:00.198 --> 07:01.187
What?

07:49.147 --> 07:51.308
Yo, what's a boomer?

07:51.483 --> 07:52.745
-What?
-A boomer!

07:52.917 --> 07:54.680
Oh, a kangaroo.

07:54.853 --> 07:56.753
It was two of your blokes. Americans.

07:56.921 --> 08:00.516
They were chasing after this kangaroo
in a red shiny jacket.

08:01.426 --> 08:04.486
Don't that dork, Louis Booker,
always wear a shiny red jacket?

08:04.662 --> 08:06.129
Yeah.

08:20.779 --> 08:22.838
Never should have left the pub.

08:25.183 --> 08:26.514
Yes! Yeah!

08:26.684 --> 08:28.845
Is this an Olympic event?
Because I am bolo man!

08:29.020 --> 08:30.954
I am bolo man!

08:31.122 --> 08:32.645
-Bingo!
-Dingo? Where?

08:32.823 --> 08:34.188
No, bingo. Look.

08:34.359 --> 08:37.192
-Nice call, Jessie.
-So, that's Jackie Legs.

08:37.361 --> 08:38.953
Kangaroo Jack in the flesh.

08:39.130 --> 08:41.563
Can't get near him like that.
He'll take off running.

08:41.732 --> 08:43.360
So, what do we do?

08:43.534 --> 08:45.628
We have to disguise ourselves.

08:45.804 --> 08:47.362
Get rid of our human scent.

08:47.539 --> 08:50.030
And how are we going to do that?

08:56.714 --> 08:58.579
We need to get a little closer.

08:58.750 --> 09:02.686
Now, the only time we move
is when he's feeding.

09:03.288 --> 09:07.918
This is very important. Don't make any
sudden movements or sounds.

09:08.093 --> 09:09.526
-Okay.
-Got it.

09:10.662 --> 09:11.686
There he goes.

09:24.242 --> 09:25.709
Shit!

09:25.877 --> 09:27.674
What is your problem?

09:27.846 --> 09:31.111
-I got ants crawling up my leg!
-Just ignore them!

09:31.282 --> 09:33.944
-I thought she said no sudden movements!
-Boys. Boys!

09:35.253 --> 09:36.515
Hello?

09:37.989 --> 09:41.390
-We're close enough. Spread out.
-Charlie.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.691
They're having a picnic in my shorts.
And I brought the sweets!

09:45.864 --> 09:48.458
-Louis, just keep it together!
-Okay!

09:48.633 --> 09:50.794
Keep it together, Louis!

09:51.669 --> 09:53.364
Keep it together.

10:11.589 --> 10:12.886
I can't take it no more!

10:13.057 --> 10:14.547
Oh, God!

10:19.364 --> 10:23.562
Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I'm gonna roll in the grass!

10:23.735 --> 10:26.670
This is great! This is just great!
Now what are we gonna do?

10:26.838 --> 10:29.830
Well, there's no more we can do today.
We'll just have to wait.

10:30.008 --> 10:32.408
-I have an idea where they'll be tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

10:32.577 --> 10:34.306
No. This has gotta happen today.

10:34.479 --> 10:37.141
We'll pitch camp here.
I'll get the firewood.

10:38.416 --> 10:39.940
Oh, God.

10:40.952 --> 10:43.443
Hey, sorry about that, man.
I was under attack.

10:43.621 --> 10:46.988
That's all right. Look at her.
She thinks she's so much smarter than us.

10:47.492 --> 10:49.517
I'm pretty sure she is, Charlie.

10:50.962 --> 10:52.987
Let me ask you something, Mr. Jimmy.

10:53.932 --> 10:57.060
Where do I go if I'm looking
for a missing kangaroo?

10:58.369 --> 11:01.031
The sky is dry for many months.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.999
-Wind is guiet from the--
-Kangaroos, Jim! Where are they?

11:06.644 --> 11:09.511
The best bet is right here. Owen Springs.

11:42.847 --> 11:43.905
What are you doing?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.074
Jessie! I was going to take a bath.

11:47.885 --> 11:48.909
Go!

11:50.688 --> 11:51.848
-Yes!
-No.

11:52.023 --> 11:55.618
Look, I'm hot, I'm filthy
and I wanna take a bath.

11:55.793 --> 11:58.455
You can stay, you can go,
it makes no difference to me.

11:58.630 --> 12:02.157
-Well, I'm not leaving. I was here first.
-Suit yourself.

12:15.446 --> 12:16.879
It's gorgeous.

12:19.217 --> 12:20.912
Hey, what are looking at?

12:21.552 --> 12:24.214
-Well, you looked first.
-Yeah, I looked.

12:24.389 --> 12:26.653
So, I looked too, all right?

12:28.459 --> 12:30.017
Come near me, I'll kill you.

12:30.194 --> 12:31.923
So nervous.

12:32.463 --> 12:35.591
You have absolutely no effect on me.

12:35.767 --> 12:36.791
No?

12:36.968 --> 12:40.199
-You think you do.
-Just stating the obvious.

12:40.371 --> 12:44.603
You are so not my type! You could kiss me
and it wouldn't make the slightest...

12:49.414 --> 12:52.281
-...difference.
-Nothing?

12:52.450 --> 12:54.850
No. Sorry.

12:55.019 --> 12:59.456
Well, I hate break it to you, honey, but that
kiss did absolutely nothing for me, either.

12:59.624 --> 13:01.990
I'm not surprised,
if that's the best you can kiss.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.321
You want to see the best I can kiss?

13:04.495 --> 13:06.725
As a matter of fact, l--

13:12.870 --> 13:14.428
See?

13:15.139 --> 13:16.697
Nothing.

13:16.874 --> 13:18.273
Same here. Nothing.

13:18.443 --> 13:20.070
Really?

13:21.112 --> 13:23.637
All right, I'll admit it.

13:24.415 --> 13:29.910
This is the most sensual
romantic moment of my entire life.

13:38.262 --> 13:39.524
And now it's over.

13:54.045 --> 13:55.205
Hey, guys...

13:55.880 --> 13:57.347
...l think it's time to get up.

13:59.784 --> 14:01.445
What's going on?

14:01.619 --> 14:04.520
-We're in a little bit of trouble.
-A little?

14:05.223 --> 14:09.819
I've been following camel tracks all bloody
morning, so let's make short work of this.

14:09.994 --> 14:11.825
Where's me moolah?

14:11.996 --> 14:14.988
For God's sakes!
All this over $4000?

14:18.669 --> 14:20.432
It's more, isn't it?

14:21.572 --> 14:23.335
How much more?

14:23.508 --> 14:25.203
$46,000 more.

14:25.376 --> 14:27.537
And every cent of it is mine.

14:27.712 --> 14:29.543
Now, there are two ways of doing this.

14:29.714 --> 14:32.649
And one of them is a lot less painful
than the other.

14:34.218 --> 14:35.549
Where's the money?

14:37.622 --> 14:39.146
See, what happened was...

14:39.323 --> 14:41.348
...we was driving and we hit this kangaroo.

14:41.526 --> 14:43.653
-I was wearing my lucky jacket--
-Wrong answer.

14:43.828 --> 14:47.059
Your mate, Blue, told us
that yarn about the boomer.

14:48.499 --> 14:49.727
Mate.

14:49.901 --> 14:54.497
I hope for your sake you were stupid enough
to hide that money in them saddle bags.

14:54.672 --> 14:57.334
-You gotta believe us.
-No. You gotta believe me.

14:57.508 --> 15:02.104
If it ain't there, I'm gonna carve
you up piece by piece.

15:05.850 --> 15:09.377
-It's safe to assume you're not on vacation.
-No.

15:10.054 --> 15:13.512
Charlie's stepfather is a mobster and
he sent us here to deliver a package.

15:13.691 --> 15:17.525
-And you got me into the middle of this?
-Sorry. I never thought this would happen.

15:18.663 --> 15:19.857
And you lied to me.

15:24.535 --> 15:26.196
What do you know!

15:27.205 --> 15:29.400
Bad news, fellas,
you were telling the truth.

15:31.042 --> 15:32.942
Who wants to go first?

15:36.013 --> 15:39.039
We can find your money.
If you kill us now, you'll never get it.

15:39.217 --> 15:42.948
-I'm listening.
-I know a feeding ground near Owen Springs.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.954
A eucalyptus grove a few kilometers
from here. That's where they'll be.

15:51.095 --> 15:53.620
I'll take the sheila and ride ahead.

15:53.798 --> 15:54.924
Jessie....

15:55.099 --> 15:56.430
I didn't do it for you.

16:00.137 --> 16:01.126
Listen up.

16:02.073 --> 16:06.806
Once we're out of sight, I want you to
take our friends out to Kings Canyon.

16:06.978 --> 16:10.709
You know what to do with them.
But don't go berko. Make it look natural.

16:10.882 --> 16:15.046
Two Yanks tragically karking it
in the unapologetic Outback.

16:19.257 --> 16:21.452
We're going in the wrong direction.

16:23.261 --> 16:26.162
-They're gonna kill us.
-God knows what they'll do to Jessie.

16:28.199 --> 16:30.497
I should have stopped this 20 years ago.

16:31.102 --> 16:32.330
What are you talking about?

16:32.503 --> 16:35.438
First time Sal came to my mother's
house, I knew he was no good.

16:35.606 --> 16:38.769
But he bought me this first baseman's mitt,
that Don Mattingly model.

16:38.943 --> 16:42.276
That was a great mitt.
I still feel bad about losing it.

16:42.446 --> 16:44.846
When he left, my mom asked me
what I thought of him.

16:45.016 --> 16:46.950
And I said, "l like him."

16:47.118 --> 16:50.178
I should have stood up to him
and thrown him out of my house.

16:50.354 --> 16:51.946
Charlie, you were 1 0.

16:52.123 --> 16:55.115
Sal was right, Louis.
I got chicken blood.

16:55.293 --> 16:57.352
I had it my whole life.

17:00.464 --> 17:01.863
But that stops right now.

17:02.733 --> 17:05.759
Louis, reach into my pants.

17:05.936 --> 17:10.636
Don't do this. Go out like a man.
Look, we all have urges.

17:10.808 --> 17:14.710
I remember this one time,
there was this well-built Latino--

17:14.878 --> 17:18.280
My scissors! Reach into my pants
and get my scissors.

17:18.449 --> 17:19.939
Okay.

17:22.153 --> 17:23.619
Okay, Louis.

17:24.221 --> 17:26.415
-Are you ready to go?
-You bet.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.357
You think you can distract them?

17:31.529 --> 17:34.760
You mean, make them watch this hand
instead of this one?

17:35.333 --> 17:36.891
Piece of cake.

17:38.669 --> 17:40.227
Freeze, sucker!

17:41.672 --> 17:44.038
Get your hands up and turn slowly!

17:49.847 --> 17:51.474
I'm warning you!

17:51.649 --> 17:56.712
In 1 983, I was the starting pitcher
in the Little League World Series.

17:57.788 --> 18:00.621
I struck out 1 6 Taiwanese All-Stars!

18:00.791 --> 18:05.319
To this day, the people of Asia
call me Sun Luc Dong...

18:05.496 --> 18:09.262
...which means big black man
pretending to be 1 2!

18:14.372 --> 18:18.274
My name's Carbone,
which means skinny white boy with a gun.

18:18.876 --> 18:21.606
Good work, Sun Luc Dong.

19:15.232 --> 19:16.460
You said they'd be here.

19:16.634 --> 19:19.364
You're trying to pull a swifty
and I don't much like that.

19:19.537 --> 19:22.165
There's also an area further along.

19:22.339 --> 19:24.273
I'm tired of your howling.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.204
What in bloody...?

19:29.613 --> 19:31.513
Change of plans, Smith.

19:35.152 --> 19:37.780
Come on, you two.
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

19:39.623 --> 19:41.147
Jessie, come here.

19:41.325 --> 19:44.385
-Easy, darling.
-Drop the knife, Smith.

19:48.299 --> 19:51.359
You ever held a gun before, Charlie?

19:51.535 --> 19:52.866
Don't answer that.

19:53.871 --> 19:54.997
No.

19:56.574 --> 19:58.542
You ever killed a man, Charlie?

19:58.709 --> 20:00.074
Don't answer that.

20:01.078 --> 20:02.204
No.

20:02.780 --> 20:06.648
What do you do for a living
that makes you so brave, Charlie?

20:06.817 --> 20:08.546
Really don't answer that.

20:12.356 --> 20:16.156
I'm a hairdresser.
Now, drop the knife.

20:17.294 --> 20:18.693
Come here, Jessie.

20:18.863 --> 20:20.888
Yeah! We bad.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.169
If you think you're off the hook
because you came back for me....

20:26.337 --> 20:27.565
Never crossed my mind.

20:30.441 --> 20:33.274
You better hope that's someone
coming to rescue you.

20:36.514 --> 20:37.845
Frankie!

20:38.449 --> 20:41.043
-What are you doing here?
-Sal heard you were having trouble...

20:41.218 --> 20:42.617
...so he sent us to help you out.

20:42.787 --> 20:45.551
-Who the hell are you?
-Frank Lombardo.

20:45.723 --> 20:48.954
I represent the interests of Salvatore Maggio.

20:49.126 --> 20:52.061
-You must be Smith.
-You're not wrong.

20:53.297 --> 20:56.289
-What's going on here?
-These guys were trying to kill us.

20:56.467 --> 20:59.402
Looks like we got here just in time.

21:01.539 --> 21:03.302
You did good, kid.

21:03.474 --> 21:07.171
Now, put that gun down
before you hurt yourself, all right?

21:12.650 --> 21:14.413
Wow, Frankie.

21:14.585 --> 21:17.315
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.

21:20.658 --> 21:23.092
Frankie, this is Jessie.
Jessie, this is Frankie.

21:24.028 --> 21:26.428
-Hi.
-You see...

21:26.597 --> 21:29.828
...Louis and l, we fell
a little behind schedule--

21:30.000 --> 21:33.060
And Jessie came along and helped us
get back on schedule again.

21:33.237 --> 21:35.262
And so, you know-- Uh-oh.

21:35.439 --> 21:37.236
I know all about it, Charlie.

21:39.577 --> 21:41.704
So you know about Jackie Legs?

21:41.879 --> 21:44.507
From Canarsie? He's involved in this?

21:45.583 --> 21:48.814
No, you guys are so sneaky and clever,
I didn't know.

21:48.986 --> 21:52.649
Hurricanes leave smaller trails
than you two morons.

21:55.593 --> 21:59.324
Sal is very disappointed to hear
you lost that money.

22:01.365 --> 22:02.696
We'll get the money back.

22:02.867 --> 22:08.100
It's too late for that. This time you
screwed up big. Final straw big.

22:08.272 --> 22:11.571
Enough of the claptrap.
That money is mine.

22:11.742 --> 22:13.141
Zip the lip, Dundee.

22:13.310 --> 22:16.507
We had a contract
and it didn't involve no bloody roo.

22:19.350 --> 22:22.615
I had to come all the way down here
to the sphincter of the galaxy...

22:22.786 --> 22:25.880
...to straighten out this
puked-up fur ball of a mess.

22:26.056 --> 22:28.354
-Do not agitate me.
-We had a contract!

22:28.525 --> 22:31.289
Do not agitate me!

22:47.478 --> 22:48.706
Let's get out of here.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.412
Jessie, get as far away
from here as you can.

22:55.586 --> 22:57.053
They're not after you.

22:57.221 --> 22:59.018
Louis, we gotta get the money.

22:59.189 --> 23:01.851
We drive the roo into the canyon,
we can corner him there.

23:02.026 --> 23:03.823
-We?
-We did have a deal.

23:15.105 --> 23:16.402
Enough!

23:19.510 --> 23:21.102
Contract terminated.

23:21.278 --> 23:22.609
Get in the car!

23:27.518 --> 23:30.214
-There he goes!
-Turn him into the canyon!

23:37.995 --> 23:39.121
Frankie!

23:53.811 --> 23:55.438
Come on!

23:56.647 --> 23:57.978
We got them!

24:07.524 --> 24:09.719
Shoot at them, you idiot!

24:11.729 --> 24:13.890
I could've stayed in Brooklyn for this!

24:16.800 --> 24:17.960
Come on, baby!

24:22.573 --> 24:23.870
Hold on!

24:30.681 --> 24:32.615
I hate this country like a sickness!

24:35.319 --> 24:36.752
Not me! Them!

24:39.023 --> 24:40.012
My bad.

24:42.926 --> 24:44.018
Bad brats!

24:44.194 --> 24:46.685
-Get the dumb thing out of my face!
-I got it!

24:48.332 --> 24:49.890
Watch your head!

24:50.634 --> 24:52.864
-Watch out!
-For what?

25:01.345 --> 25:02.676
Tight fit!

25:03.814 --> 25:04.974
Crap!

25:23.400 --> 25:25.960
-Louis, he's coming to you!
-Go get him, big guy!

25:26.703 --> 25:29.729
I'm gonna get that money, Charlie!
I'm going for the money!

25:31.608 --> 25:33.269
Oh, my God!

25:35.612 --> 25:37.671
-Louis!
-Watch out!

25:40.250 --> 25:42.047
Louis, no!

25:42.219 --> 25:44.016
Stay still, Jackie Legs!

25:46.223 --> 25:48.054
Yeah, I got it! I got it!

25:48.225 --> 25:50.989
-I got the money!
-Louis!

25:57.801 --> 25:59.564
Louis!

26:00.204 --> 26:02.365
Hurry, Charlie!

26:02.539 --> 26:04.598
I'm slipping, Charlie!

26:07.010 --> 26:08.443
Charlie!

26:08.946 --> 26:10.573
Louis, grab my hand.

26:10.747 --> 26:12.214
Louis!

26:15.786 --> 26:17.617
-Charlie!
-Hold on, Louis!

26:19.923 --> 26:21.185
Give me your belt!

26:21.358 --> 26:22.689
You'll be all right!

26:22.860 --> 26:23.986
Charlie!

26:24.161 --> 26:25.719
Grab that rope. Grab that rope!

26:32.769 --> 26:34.361
Charlie!

26:35.506 --> 26:37.064
Grab the belt, Louis.

26:40.277 --> 26:42.245
I can't reach it, Charlie!

26:42.412 --> 26:44.903
Grab the damn belt!

26:47.050 --> 26:48.244
It's now or never, Louis!

26:55.859 --> 26:57.451
-Pull me up!
-Louis.

26:59.730 --> 27:02.824
You have really got to cut back on the pie!

27:03.000 --> 27:05.195
Don't you let me go, Charlie!

27:05.369 --> 27:06.427
Don't you let me go!

27:07.604 --> 27:09.435
Go, go, go! Up, up!

27:09.606 --> 27:11.665
Pull, Jessie. A little more!

27:11.842 --> 27:13.605
Come on, Louis!
Jessie, a little more!

27:13.777 --> 27:15.108
Come on!

27:16.313 --> 27:18.679
Charlie! I'm slipping!

27:31.528 --> 27:33.826
I'm gonna name my first son after you.

27:35.399 --> 27:37.458
"Crazy-Ass White Boy."

27:45.409 --> 27:46.706
Let go of me!

27:47.544 --> 27:49.171
Let go of me!

27:51.715 --> 27:53.342
This is from Sal Maggio.

27:53.517 --> 27:56.281
Frankie, we got the money back.
We got it back!

27:57.821 --> 27:59.220
We got it!

27:59.389 --> 28:01.857
You don't get it, do you, Charlie?

28:02.025 --> 28:04.755
Sal's not disappointed because
he cares about the money.

28:04.928 --> 28:08.489
He's disappointed because
you two aren't dead!

28:10.200 --> 28:13.465
What do you think he was paying
Smith 50 grand for?

28:16.440 --> 28:20.069
We traveled halfway across the world
to pay for our own execution?

28:20.244 --> 28:24.578
Yeah, you two guys were
the bagmen for your own hit.

28:24.748 --> 28:26.739
Pretty clever.

28:26.917 --> 28:28.316
Not on our part.

28:29.219 --> 28:30.243
Say good night.

28:38.929 --> 28:42.660
This is Senior Sergeant
Jimmy lnkamala, Australian Police.

28:42.833 --> 28:46.291
-Mr. Jimmy?
-Drop your weapon and--

28:58.482 --> 29:01.747
Hey, Frankie! Go long!

29:16.366 --> 29:20.234
-I am bolo man.
-That's what I'm talking about.

29:24.274 --> 29:28.540
Yes, Mr. Smith was one of our
most notorious contract killers.

29:28.712 --> 29:33.274
We got a tip from the FBI that he was
involved with the Maggio family.

29:33.450 --> 29:37.352
Yeah, and when Frankie Lombardo called
looking for a guide, I was waiting.

29:37.521 --> 29:38.988
I'm just glad I made it in time.

29:39.589 --> 29:43.525
You pansy-ass retards are dead!
You hear me? Dead!

29:43.694 --> 29:47.095
I'll slaughter you like veal!
I'll wear your eyeballs like jewelry!

29:47.264 --> 29:50.756
I've always found the Brooklyn
vernacular fascinating.

29:53.437 --> 29:54.927
Quite colorful, really.

29:55.105 --> 29:58.871
Hey, Frankie?
Can I have your Yankees tickets?

30:06.183 --> 30:08.708
There you are! They were full.

30:08.885 --> 30:12.218
They're radioing Alice Springs
to send another chopper for us.

30:13.123 --> 30:14.613
What's up, man?

30:18.528 --> 30:19.722
Charlie.

30:21.765 --> 30:25.166
Something really important
happened here today.

30:26.103 --> 30:28.333
You saved my life.

30:28.605 --> 30:32.166
-Yeah, I know. So now we're even.
-Exactly.

30:32.342 --> 30:34.833
You don't owe me anymore.
You're rid of me.

30:35.011 --> 30:36.842
What are you talking about,
I'm rid of you?

30:37.013 --> 30:40.847
Come on, Charlie, guilt was the glue
that held this friendship together.

30:41.184 --> 30:44.585
-You never needed me.
-You're wrong, Louis.

30:44.755 --> 30:45.847
I've always needed you.

30:49.526 --> 30:52.359
You know when you call me up,
and you're, like:

30:52.529 --> 30:55.726
"Yo, Charlie, you gotta help me drive
some greyhounds up from Florida."

30:55.966 --> 30:58.935
And I make out like I'm doing you
this big favor?

30:59.369 --> 31:02.600
Truth is, you're doing me the favor.

31:02.773 --> 31:09.008
Every story in my life worth telling
starts with the words Louis and l.

31:09.679 --> 31:12.477
Come on, get away from me
with that, man.

31:16.953 --> 31:20.116
You think we're friends
because you saved my life once?

31:21.491 --> 31:24.426
You save my life every day, Louis.

31:31.635 --> 31:33.432
Come on, man.

31:35.105 --> 31:36.868
Guys?

31:37.407 --> 31:39.466
Can you hold on a second?

31:39.643 --> 31:42.976
We're having a very intimate,
non-gay moment.

31:43.146 --> 31:44.773
Take a look.

31:53.457 --> 31:55.482
-What are you doing?
-Hello, Jackie Legs.

32:03.099 --> 32:08.435
Here you go, boy. Here you go. Yeah.

32:08.605 --> 32:10.300
That's a boy.

32:10.974 --> 32:14.137
Good boy. Here you are.

32:14.611 --> 32:17.205
Hey, there, little guy. Yeah.

32:18.281 --> 32:19.748
There you go.

32:21.017 --> 32:25.283
It's okay. It's okay.
Let me just grab this.

32:25.455 --> 32:28.720
There you are. Good boy.

32:28.892 --> 32:30.621
There you go.

32:47.677 --> 32:49.542
So long, Jackie Legs.

32:54.451 --> 32:57.284
Hey, would you look at that?

32:57.454 --> 33:01.356
-Louis, your lucky jacket.
-I don't think so!

33:01.525 --> 33:04.392
Hear me out. If you hadn't
put the money in the jacket...

33:04.561 --> 33:06.153
...and the jacket on the kangaroo...

33:06.329 --> 33:09.423
...we would've delivered the money
to Smith and he would've killed us.

33:09.599 --> 33:11.089
Your lucky jacket.

33:12.736 --> 33:16.331
Gimme my jacket! I told you. Didn't I
tell you this was my lucky jacket?

33:21.978 --> 33:24.674
Look, Louis, he's back.

33:25.348 --> 33:27.578
And he's got a family.

33:30.453 --> 33:36.585
Hey, you must be Jackie Junior.
You're a cute little guy, aren't you?

33:42.432 --> 33:43.922
Oh, my God! Are you all right?!

33:50.907 --> 33:52.568
So, that's my story.

33:52.742 --> 33:54.607
Well, not quite.

33:54.778 --> 33:56.712
Frankie and his goons
were put away for good.

33:58.081 --> 34:01.847
As for Sal, he used all his high-level
connections to avoid going to prison.

34:02.018 --> 34:03.178
And you know what?

34:05.555 --> 34:06.749
It wasn't enough.

34:07.190 --> 34:10.681
Jessie? She ended up marrying
some filthy-rich tycoon.

34:10.860 --> 34:12.121
Hey, honey.

34:12.562 --> 34:13.585
Hi, honey.

34:13.763 --> 34:16.960
Yep, the filthy-rich dude, that's me.

34:17.132 --> 34:19.158
Louis and I used the 50 grand
as startup money.

34:19.335 --> 34:22.328
And now Snakeskin Lily Berry
Shampoo...

34:22.505 --> 34:25.132
...is the biggest thing
since Vidal Sassoon.

34:25.308 --> 34:28.106
Got the latest numbers in from Europe.
Think you'll like them.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.938
I love numbers.

34:30.112 --> 34:32.638
Hey, partner? I got the new numbers.

34:34.384 --> 34:36.750
Partner? Partner?

34:36.920 --> 34:39.150
Look out below!

34:51.568 --> 34:54.469
-Louis!
-Just trying my newest idea:

34:54.638 --> 34:57.903
Waterproof mousse! How do you like it?

35:02.479 --> 35:03.969
So that's me, Charlie Carbone.

35:04.147 --> 35:07.116
The one with the beautiful girl,
all the money I could ever want...

35:07.283 --> 35:09.080
...and my best friend Louis...

35:09.252 --> 35:13.086
...who saved my life more times
than he'll ever know.

35:26.803 --> 35:27.963
Wait a minute!

35:28.138 --> 35:32.336
The movie is called Kangaroo Jack!
It should end with me!

35:32.509 --> 35:35.672
I'm a serious,
classically trained actor!

35:36.012 --> 35:39.573
I can sing, I can dance and I can jump
out of the way of explosions.

35:39.749 --> 35:41.649
Yeah, no, that gonna leave a mark.

35:41.985 --> 35:43.816
And I can do impersonations.

35:44.187 --> 35:47.054
Come on, people.
Throw me a freaking bone.

35:47.223 --> 35:51.284
I have a son.
I shall call him Mini-Roo.

35:51.695 --> 35:55.859
Now, that should be the way you
end a film. With the star.

35:56.032 --> 35:57.397
Someone call my agent!

35:59.335 --> 36:01.565
That's all, blokes!
