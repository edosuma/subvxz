you off the hook

something different.

how to do it one way.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.601
They were a gift.

21:35.601 --> 21:39.734
Al, you don't think
I'm getting old, do you?

21:39.734 --> 21:41.968
Peg, you look
just the way you did

21:41.968 --> 21:43.100
the day I married you.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.167
Only difference is
today I'm not dead drunk.

21:48.033 --> 21:50.667
Oh, Al.

21:50.667 --> 21:51.701
All right, Peg,

21:51.701 --> 21:54.200
we both know
this isn't the end of it.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.367
Let's get to it.

21:55.367 --> 21:57.534
Let's go upstairs.

21:57.534 --> 21:58.567
See, you're
never satisfied.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.367
Do you know
what I had to go through

22:00.367 --> 22:01.567
to get that present?

22:01.567 --> 22:03.400
I had to drive
to Wisconsin.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.934
I had to reassure Steve
that I find him attractive.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.267
I had to sit
in the store for an hour

22:09.267 --> 22:11.234
and look
at nothing but, uh...

22:15.601 --> 22:17.167
Yeah, let's go upstairs.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.801
[LAUGHS]

22:23.868 --> 22:25.033
[GIGGLES]

22:36.701 --> 22:39.901
AL:
Peg, who's the cop
with his pants on backwards?

22:43.167 --> 22:44.100
[***]

22:45.305 --> 22:51.404
