<i>Now, where to begin?</i>

00:23.687 --> 00:27.179
<i>How 'bout, "Once upon a time"?</i>

00:28.792 --> 00:31.317
<i>How many times have you heard</i>
<i>that to begin a story?</i>

00:31.395 --> 00:34.023
<i>Let's do somethin' else.</i>
<i> I got it, I got it,</i>

00:34.097 --> 00:35.997
<i>here we go.</i>
<i>Here's how to open a movie!</i>

00:38.201 --> 00:41.637
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>
<i>It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?</i>

00:43.373 --> 00:44.670
<i>Oh, no, no, not the book.</i>

00:44.741 --> 00:47.073
<i>How many have seen</i>
<i>"opening the book" before?</i>

00:47.144 --> 00:50.079
<i>- Close the book. 
We're not doing that.</i>

00:50.147 --> 00:50.845
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

00:50.879 --> 00:51.541
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

00:51.614 --> 00:54.082
<i>Why don't I just go back to the day</i>

00:54.150 --> 00:57.142
<i>things took a turn for the worse?</i>

01:03.193 --> 01:06.424
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!

01:06.496 --> 01:09.431
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!

01:09.499 --> 01:12.195
Code red! Duck and cover!

01:12.268 --> 01:13.633
You're all in danger!

01:13.703 --> 01:16.968
Ah!

01:20.677 --> 01:22.508
Run for cover!

01:24.614 --> 01:26.980
Run for your lives!

01:29.452 --> 01:31.147
Emergency! Emergency!

01:44.234 --> 01:45.565
Whoa!

01:49.105 --> 01:51.164
- Whoa!
- Aaah!

01:57.714 --> 02:00.649
Look out! Take cover!

02:19.002 --> 02:21.266
Run for cover!

02:22.806 --> 02:25.775
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?

02:25.842 --> 02:28.572
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

02:28.645 --> 02:31.842
- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?

02:31.915 --> 02:33.815
No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!

02:33.883 --> 02:37.410
No. Son? What?

02:37.487 --> 02:39.682
It happened under the old oak tree!

02:39.756 --> 02:41.485
I'm not making this up. It's here.

02:41.558 --> 02:44.391
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...

02:44.461 --> 02:45.928
...somewhere on the ground.

02:45.995 --> 02:48.190
It was shaped like that!

02:48.264 --> 02:50.357
- It looks like a stop sign?
- Yes!

02:50.433 --> 02:54.267
Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.

02:54.337 --> 02:56.362
And it hit me on the head!

02:56.439 --> 02:58.964
- It looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?

02:59.042 --> 03:01.010
- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?

03:01.077 --> 03:03.739
Oh, no, Dad. It was
definitely a piece of the sky!

03:03.813 --> 03:05.940
Piece of the sky. It's OK, everyone!

03:06.015 --> 03:08.950
- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.

03:09.018 --> 03:12.613
It was just an acorn that-that
hit my son. A little acorn.

03:12.689 --> 03:14.156
- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.

03:14.224 --> 03:16.385
This is embarrassing enough already.

03:16.459 --> 03:18.586
Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'?

03:18.661 --> 03:20.686
Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?

03:20.763 --> 03:23.061
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?

03:23.132 --> 03:26.966
- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?

03:27.036 --> 03:30.199
- A big acorn level fluh...
- It was a big acorn?

03:30.273 --> 03:34.334
- An ape throwing coleslaw?
- A big acorn level fluh...

03:34.410 --> 03:35.843
Gesundheit!

03:35.912 --> 03:38.278
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,

03:38.348 --> 03:41.408
- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!

03:41.484 --> 03:43.884
Your kid went
and scared us all half to death!

03:43.953 --> 03:47.081
Well, what can I tell you,
folks, my son,

03:47.156 --> 03:51.252
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...

03:51.327 --> 03:54.728
No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.

03:54.797 --> 03:57.891
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.

03:59.168 --> 04:01.033
You gotta believe me.

04:13.682 --> 04:16.981
A movie. A movie.

04:17.052 --> 04:18.678
They're makin' a movie.

04:18.753 --> 04:20.687
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

04:20.721 --> 04:22.622
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

04:22.691 --> 04:26.149
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,

04:26.227 --> 04:28.787
then the book on tape,
then the board game,

04:28.863 --> 04:32.094
the spoons with your face on it...

04:32.167 --> 04:33.630
...and the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

04:33.665 --> 04:35.094
...and the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.195
- You saw them, right?
- Yeah. I saw them.

04:37.272 --> 04:38.671
Can't eat off 'em.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.538
- They're not microwave-safe.
- You saw the billboards?

04:41.610 --> 04:43.100
I saw them.

04:45.147 --> 04:49.948
Ha! There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.

04:50.018 --> 04:53.419
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.

04:53.488 --> 04:58.892
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.157
It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.

05:02.230 --> 05:05.358
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you

05:05.434 --> 05:07.493
it would be better for you to lay low,

05:07.569 --> 05:09.503
don't call attention to yourself?

05:09.571 --> 05:11.664
- Yes, but I...
- See, it's like a game.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.332
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek,

05:13.408 --> 05:16.866
except the goal
is never to be found, ever!

05:16.945 --> 05:18.412
Great!

05:18.480 --> 05:20.812
Now, we've got a plan, right?

05:23.718 --> 05:28.121
I'll see ya later! Remember, lay low.

05:28.824 --> 05:30.883
Yeah. OK.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.488
Bye.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.427
Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken!

05:40.502 --> 05:44.268
Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!

05:46.641 --> 05:50.236
That's it. Today is a new day.

07:43.324 --> 07:44.951
How's it going?

08:43.650 --> 08:44.640
Ahem.

08:44.718 --> 08:47.482
- Very well. Foxy Loxy.
- Present, pretty, punctual.

08:47.554 --> 08:49.317
Goosey Loosey.

08:49.390 --> 08:51.381
Master Runt of the Litter.

08:51.458 --> 08:55.485
Present and accounted for,
Mr. Woolensworth.

08:55.562 --> 08:57.393
Oop! Dropped my pencil!

08:58.165 --> 09:01.999
Whoa! Ahh!

09:02.069 --> 09:03.559
- Loser!
- Henny Penny.

09:03.637 --> 09:04.797
- Here.
- Ducky Lucky.

09:04.872 --> 09:05.998
- Here.
- Fuzzy Wuzzy.

09:06.073 --> 09:08.633
- Here.
- Morkubine Porcupine.

09:08.709 --> 09:11.143
- Yo.
- Fish Out of Water.

09:19.186 --> 09:21.814
Quite. Abby Mallard.

09:21.889 --> 09:22.981
Ugly duckling.

09:25.092 --> 09:27.185
Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior

09:27.261 --> 09:30.788
- at the expense of a fellow...
- No worries, Mr. Woolensworth.

09:30.864 --> 09:33.332
Yah!

09:33.400 --> 09:37.359
You mustn't sneak up on me,
Ugly... uh, Abby.

09:37.438 --> 09:39.770
- Where was I?
- Ugly duckling.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.467
Oh, yes.

09:42.810 --> 09:44.710
Chicken Little.

09:45.612 --> 09:47.307
Hmm.

09:47.381 --> 09:50.839
- Tardy again.
- Tardy again. Hmm.

09:50.918 --> 09:55.787
Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.290
- He.
- Baa.

09:58.359 --> 10:00.088
- She.
- Baa.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.094
- They.
- Baa.

10:02.162 --> 10:04.153
- We.
- Baa.

10:04.231 --> 10:05.543
OK, everyone. Listen up!

10:05.578 --> 10:06.855
OK, everyone. Listen up!

10:06.934 --> 10:09.869
I don't wanna hear any quacks,
tweets, oinks, whinnies

10:09.937 --> 10:15.068
or cocklee-doodle-doos
when I say... dodgeball.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.043
Oh, man.

10:18.112 --> 10:20.512
Pump it up! Pump it, pump it, pump it!

10:20.581 --> 10:23.880
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.

10:23.951 --> 10:25.612
- Coach?
- Yeah, unpopular?

10:25.686 --> 10:28.416
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?

10:28.489 --> 10:30.889
Sure! Hit the pig, kids!

10:36.964 --> 10:38.295
Aaah!

10:40.100 --> 10:41.795
Look out!

10:41.869 --> 10:43.496
Calm down, Runt. Just...

10:43.570 --> 10:45.800
Just do what Fish is doing.

10:58.952 --> 11:00.180
Whew!

11:00.254 --> 11:02.654
- Tough morning?
- A run-in with my old nemesis.

11:02.723 --> 11:04.850
- Gum in the crosswalk?
- He won this round.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.018
- Your old foe!
- Mm-hmm.

11:07.094 --> 11:09.756
- Incoming on your right.
- Thank you!

11:15.803 --> 11:17.896
Aah!

11:21.341 --> 11:24.208
Yeah, I heard about
the movie. Tough break.

11:24.278 --> 11:26.803
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.871
That's the least of my problems.

11:28.949 --> 11:32.783
This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.

11:32.853 --> 11:34.514
But that's not gonna get me down.

11:34.588 --> 11:36.647
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?

11:36.723 --> 11:38.623
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no! This one's good.

11:38.692 --> 11:41.661
Look, one moment destroyed
my life, right? One moment.

11:41.728 --> 11:43.320
- Warthog at 3:00!
- I see him!

11:45.299 --> 11:47.961
- Yes!
- So I figure all I need is a chance...

11:48.035 --> 11:50.799
All I need is a chance
to do something great

11:50.871 --> 11:54.238
to make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.

11:54.308 --> 11:57.175
And then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.

11:57.244 --> 11:58.609
Time out!

12:01.682 --> 12:03.582
Nurse!

12:06.453 --> 12:09.115
- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?

12:09.189 --> 12:11.350
So, what do you think?

12:11.425 --> 12:13.154
OK, listen.

12:13.227 --> 12:15.092
You said the sky was falling.

12:15.162 --> 12:17.426
- Your dad didn't support you.
- I...

12:17.498 --> 12:21.434
And you have been hurting
inside ever since, right?

12:21.502 --> 12:24.027
- It's hurt. It stung. OK?
- It's hurt, but... Yes.

12:24.104 --> 12:26.129
- That's the nutshell.
- OK. Yes, but...

12:26.206 --> 12:27.969
- No. Buh-buh...
- But, it's...

12:28.041 --> 12:32.171
What's got to happen now
is the nut needs to be cracked open.

12:32.246 --> 12:34.942
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!

12:35.015 --> 12:38.610
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

12:38.685 --> 12:41.950
Denial! Fear!
Deep depression, in fact!

12:42.022 --> 12:43.455
You see what I'm saying?

12:44.825 --> 12:46.053
Uh...

12:46.126 --> 12:49.152
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.

12:49.229 --> 12:53.029
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.364
- OK, yes, but...
- Here's the real solution.

12:55.435 --> 12:57.926
You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!

12:58.005 --> 12:59.165
- Closure?
- Closure,

12:59.239 --> 13:01.639
talking about something
until it's resolved.

13:01.742 --> 13:04.176
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.

13:04.211 --> 13:07.510
There's a whole section about it
in this month's <i>Modern Mallard.</i>

13:07.581 --> 13:10.982
- Incredibly appropriate!
- I told you, I have a plan.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.985
Yeah, but according to <i>Cosmo Duck,</i>

13:13.053 --> 13:15.783
you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk."

13:15.856 --> 13:17.414
<i>Beautiful Duckling</i> says,

13:17.491 --> 13:20.858
"Avoiding closure with your parents
can cause early molting."

13:20.928 --> 13:23.226
See? Closure.

13:23.297 --> 13:25.993
Repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...

13:26.066 --> 13:29.058
Abby, listen! Talking's a waste of time.

13:29.136 --> 13:32.697
I got to do something great so my dad
doesn't think I'm such a loser.

13:32.773 --> 13:34.798
Come on. You are not a loser.

13:34.875 --> 13:38.743
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...

13:38.812 --> 13:40.211
What?

13:40.280 --> 13:44.717
Yeah... uh, Runt!

13:44.785 --> 13:48.346
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air

13:48.422 --> 13:52.188
or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?

13:52.259 --> 13:54.227
Band-Aid solutions!

13:54.294 --> 13:56.194
- Runt!
- Well, I'm sorry!

13:56.263 --> 13:58.254
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.

13:58.332 --> 13:59.959
Fish, help me out here.

14:15.148 --> 14:16.672
Men.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.684
'T was beauty that killed the beast.

14:18.752 --> 14:23.553
I guess only girls are good at
honest communication and sensitivity.

14:25.692 --> 14:28.661
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!

14:28.729 --> 14:32.062
Prepare to hurt.
And I don't mean emotionally, like I do.

14:35.235 --> 14:36.463
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

14:38.372 --> 14:40.772
Whoa!

14:47.648 --> 14:49.513
We will save you!

14:50.450 --> 14:52.213
Fall back! Mad goose!

15:08.602 --> 15:10.832
Chicken Little!

15:10.904 --> 15:12.705
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

15:12.740 --> 15:14.507
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

15:14.574 --> 15:17.338
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?

15:17.411 --> 15:21.780
Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!

15:22.783 --> 15:25.616
Now look, Buck.

15:25.686 --> 15:28.382
You know I have
the utmost respect for you.

15:28.455 --> 15:30.946
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,

15:31.024 --> 15:34.482
our school baseball star.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.890
But let's face the facts.

15:39.966 --> 15:44.027
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.

15:45.005 --> 15:46.233
OK.

15:46.306 --> 15:50.470
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.841
I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.

15:55.916 --> 15:58.749
- It was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. It's fine.

15:58.819 --> 16:01.652
You don't have to explain anything.

16:18.438 --> 16:19.427
Uh...

16:21.374 --> 16:23.899
Uh... Hey, Dad?

16:23.977 --> 16:28.937
I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I?

16:29.015 --> 16:30.744
What if?

16:30.817 --> 16:33.149
What if I joined the baseball team?

16:33.220 --> 16:35.848
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!

16:35.922 --> 16:38.049
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.

16:38.125 --> 16:41.822
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.

16:41.895 --> 16:44.625
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.

16:44.698 --> 16:48.327
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.

16:48.401 --> 16:51.063
Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure?

16:51.138 --> 16:54.073
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?

16:54.141 --> 16:56.166
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,

16:56.243 --> 16:58.803
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

16:58.879 --> 17:00.540
You could give me some pointers.

17:00.647 --> 17:03.013
But, son, you know,
I'm just wondering...

17:03.049 --> 17:07.247
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

17:07.319 --> 17:10.949
Have you considered
the chess team or the glee club?

17:11.023 --> 17:14.925
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.

17:14.994 --> 17:17.054
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get some stamps.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.791
- I don't like stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...

17:19.866 --> 17:21.333
No, I was thinkin' baseball!

17:21.401 --> 17:23.368
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

17:23.435 --> 17:25.563
when I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!

17:28.842 --> 17:31.402
Dad... Um, I'm kidding.

17:31.478 --> 17:33.241
That was a... that was a joke.

17:35.448 --> 17:37.814
Just do me one favor, son.

17:37.884 --> 17:40.114
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.

17:40.187 --> 17:44.351
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.

17:44.424 --> 17:46.255
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...

17:47.694 --> 17:49.252
I mean, I think I can...

17:54.034 --> 17:55.695
I...

17:58.939 --> 18:00.338
OK, Dad.

18:49.556 --> 18:54.152
Oh, Chloe. If only you were here.

18:54.227 --> 18:56.855
You'd know what to do.

19:20.287 --> 19:22.255
- That's my boy!
- Gee, thanks, Dad!

19:39.539 --> 19:43.805
Come on. All I need is a chance.

21:49.231 --> 21:50.994
<i>Lean to the left</i>
<i>Lean to the right</i>

21:51.066 --> 21:55.526
<i>C'mon Acorns</i>
<i>Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!</i>

22:00.442 --> 22:03.878
There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.

22:03.945 --> 22:06.812
It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals

22:06.881 --> 22:08.678
the Spud Valley Taters.

22:08.750 --> 22:12.049
Down by only a single run,
and with a player in scoring position,

22:12.120 --> 22:14.179
we finally have a chance again.

22:14.256 --> 22:18.056
This excitement isn't about the fun
of baseball, it's not about the prize.

22:18.126 --> 22:20.720
It's about gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,

22:20.795 --> 22:23.889
the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting, if you will,

22:23.965 --> 22:26.627
- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!

22:28.870 --> 22:32.101
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey

22:32.173 --> 22:35.939
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!

22:41.116 --> 22:44.210
But this battle has taken
a heavy toll on our hometown heroes.

22:44.286 --> 22:48.154
After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,

22:48.223 --> 22:51.317
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.

22:51.393 --> 22:55.727
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.

22:55.797 --> 22:59.597
Up next... Chicken Little.

23:02.804 --> 23:04.863
Clearly a long shot, folks.

23:04.939 --> 23:07.908
Little hasn't been up to bat
once since joining the team.

23:07.976 --> 23:10.638
- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- Wait!

23:10.712 --> 23:13.681
If he can get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse

23:13.748 --> 23:17.479
Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all.

23:17.552 --> 23:21.852
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.

23:23.325 --> 23:24.622
OK, kid, listen up.

23:24.693 --> 23:27.389
You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.

23:27.462 --> 23:30.795
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.

23:30.865 --> 23:33.561
- I have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.

23:33.635 --> 23:36.001
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!

23:36.071 --> 23:38.505
- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!

23:40.608 --> 23:43.668
Nervous, gangly,
barely able to hold the pine,

23:43.745 --> 23:46.873
Little advances to the box.
He's going to bat from the right.

23:46.948 --> 23:50.042
Make it the left. No, the right.

23:50.118 --> 23:52.348
- The right.
- Easy out!

23:52.420 --> 23:55.446
Left field's
found something better to do,

23:55.523 --> 23:58.219
center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach

23:58.293 --> 24:01.262
- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!

24:02.097 --> 24:03.530
Why him?

24:03.598 --> 24:06.465
Why now?

24:06.534 --> 24:11.836
I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.

24:11.906 --> 24:15.171
Here's the wind-up,
the pitch! It's a high cutter.

24:15.243 --> 24:16.335
Ball!

24:18.446 --> 24:20.505
Uh... Strike one!

24:22.450 --> 24:26.819
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

24:26.888 --> 24:30.016
The catcher lays down
the signals. Here's the pitch.

24:30.091 --> 24:32.286
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

24:33.094 --> 24:35.221
Stee-rike two!

24:35.296 --> 24:36.763
Ohh!

24:37.999 --> 24:40.160
I said, don't swing!

24:41.169 --> 24:42.693
Don't swing!

24:42.771 --> 24:45.899
- No!
- Batter up!

24:48.743 --> 24:50.233
That's two in the hole!

24:50.311 --> 24:52.404
One more strike,
it's a punch out, folks,

24:52.480 --> 24:55.040
and we're all going home.

24:58.019 --> 25:00.510
Today is a new day.

25:08.396 --> 25:10.990
Don't swing!

25:21.342 --> 25:24.209
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!

25:24.279 --> 25:26.270
- A hit?
- A hit?

25:26.347 --> 25:27.974
A hit?

25:30.952 --> 25:33.785
The batter
is unbelievably at home plate.

25:33.855 --> 25:36.119
He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!

25:36.191 --> 25:38.125
Go, son! Run! Run!

25:39.561 --> 25:40.585
Run!

25:43.097 --> 25:45.292
There he goes,
the wrong way.

25:45.366 --> 25:47.493
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

25:47.569 --> 25:50.663
- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

25:50.738 --> 25:54.003
He's turned!
I've never said these words before,

25:54.075 --> 25:56.100
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

25:56.177 --> 25:59.112
- Goosey steps on home...
- A new day!

25:59.180 --> 26:02.206
A tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

26:02.283 --> 26:05.343
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!

26:05.420 --> 26:08.412
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.

26:10.658 --> 26:12.922
Catch is complete, but where's the ball?

26:12.994 --> 26:15.986
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

26:16.064 --> 26:18.862
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

26:18.933 --> 26:21.834
- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

26:21.903 --> 26:24.167
It's the old
tip-the-cow play.

26:24.239 --> 26:26.707
He heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!

26:26.774 --> 26:28.765
- Yes!
- Hold up! No!

26:28.843 --> 26:30.970
He's going for the whole enchilada!

26:31.045 --> 26:32.979
The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!

26:33.047 --> 26:35.174
Go back! You're never gonna make it!

26:35.250 --> 26:38.276
Tries to lighten his load!

26:38.353 --> 26:40.753
The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!

26:40.822 --> 26:41.948
He slides for the dish!

26:42.023 --> 26:46.050
It's going to be
a photo finish at home!

26:53.535 --> 26:55.025
You're out!

26:59.541 --> 27:02.635
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.

27:02.710 --> 27:04.507
- Wait!
- Wait!

27:04.579 --> 27:07.548
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

27:07.615 --> 27:11.415
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

27:11.986 --> 27:14.546
He's...

27:14.622 --> 27:18.023
Safe! The runner is safe!

27:21.596 --> 27:23.757
It's all over, folks!

27:23.831 --> 27:26.356
The Acorns have done the impossible!

27:26.434 --> 27:29.198
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!

27:29.270 --> 27:33.934
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!

27:34.008 --> 27:37.273
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

27:37.345 --> 27:41.008
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

27:41.082 --> 27:42.379
That was just a lucky hit!

27:42.450 --> 27:45.112
Yes,
Chicken Little, it's all yours!

27:45.186 --> 27:47.746
The victory, the triumph, the glory!

27:47.822 --> 27:51.189
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undies

27:51.259 --> 27:53.124
and chafes for hours!

27:53.194 --> 27:57.130
This is one memory you'll savor forever!

27:59.601 --> 28:01.068
Yeah!

28:02.737 --> 28:04.602
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

28:04.672 --> 28:08.768
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!

28:08.843 --> 28:10.970
That's my boy!

28:53.354 --> 28:55.015
Yow!

28:55.089 --> 28:59.526
Here's the wind-up and the pitch!

28:59.594 --> 29:01.152
- A knuckleball!
- He swings!

29:01.229 --> 29:02.321
- Crack!
- It's going.

29:02.397 --> 29:05.127
- He rounds first, to second!
- Hits high off the wall!

29:05.199 --> 29:07.326
He flies past third
and heads for the plate!

29:07.402 --> 29:10.337
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!

29:10.405 --> 29:13.465
He is safe!

29:13.541 --> 29:15.771
- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!

29:15.843 --> 29:17.310
The mighty Acorns win!

29:17.378 --> 29:19.346
Yeah!

29:29.791 --> 29:32.089
Jeez, you know,

29:32.160 --> 29:35.493
I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incident

29:35.563 --> 29:38.896
behind us once and for all. Hey, kiddo?

29:38.966 --> 29:41.025
You bet, Dad.

29:41.102 --> 29:44.333
I...

29:44.405 --> 29:48.307
Unless you think we need... closure?

29:48.376 --> 29:50.674
Closure? What's to close here?

29:50.745 --> 29:52.576
Unless you think we need to close...

29:52.647 --> 29:53.909
- Not me.
- It's closed!

29:53.981 --> 29:56.006
- I agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!

29:56.084 --> 29:59.178
OK, great, Dad. You... Closure, I dunno.

30:05.626 --> 30:07.890
All right. Enough fun.

30:07.962 --> 30:10.226
Good talk. Good talk, son.

30:11.833 --> 30:16.236
- Here, I'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.

30:16.304 --> 30:18.898
- OK.
- OK, I'm up.

30:21.476 --> 30:22.465
Hey.

30:24.612 --> 30:26.842
Good night, Ace.

30:28.049 --> 30:31.314
Here's the wind-up... and the pitch!

30:32.353 --> 30:33.581
Whoo-hoo!

30:46.667 --> 30:48.999
Thanks.

30:49.070 --> 30:51.095
Thanks for the chance.

31:18.733 --> 31:20.564
Oh...

31:29.644 --> 31:31.509
No!

31:32.880 --> 31:34.279
A piece of the sky?!

31:34.348 --> 31:36.942
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!

31:37.018 --> 31:39.145
Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!

31:39.220 --> 31:41.848
I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs!

31:41.923 --> 31:43.515
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

31:43.591 --> 31:45.582
You sure? I thought I heard you yell.

31:45.660 --> 31:46.854
No.

31:46.928 --> 31:48.657
Uh, I, uh...

31:48.729 --> 31:50.458
I fell out of bed.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.960
Huh?

31:54.035 --> 31:56.003
- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?

31:56.070 --> 31:57.367
- There. There!
- Where?

31:57.438 --> 31:59.736
How'd you get over there?

31:59.807 --> 32:01.240
Who're we talking about?

32:04.145 --> 32:07.945
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?

32:08.015 --> 32:10.779
- Mmm.
- Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

32:15.056 --> 32:18.958
Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...

32:28.536 --> 32:30.163
Good.

32:36.077 --> 32:38.204
Ah!

32:48.456 --> 32:50.185
No.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.106
No.

33:25.426 --> 33:27.621
I gotta call Abby!

33:32.733 --> 33:35.429
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

34:04.231 --> 34:07.132
Hello! Mallard residence.

34:08.835 --> 34:10.963
Runt! Quiet!
I'm on the phone!

34:13.074 --> 34:14.666
Runt!

34:14.742 --> 34:16.505
Oh...

34:18.813 --> 34:20.246
Hey! Where are you?

34:20.313 --> 34:23.612
- We already started. We were...
<i>- It opened up!</i>

34:23.684 --> 34:24.672
What?!

34:24.752 --> 34:27.186
All right, guys.

34:27.254 --> 34:28.880
Watch this.

34:31.192 --> 34:33.592
Bizarre.

34:33.661 --> 34:36.994
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.

34:37.063 --> 34:38.554
- Well...
- I knew it!

34:38.632 --> 34:41.065
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been

34:41.135 --> 34:44.161
- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
- There was talking.

34:44.237 --> 34:47.833
- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?

34:47.908 --> 34:49.136
Uh...

34:50.945 --> 34:52.572
What?

34:52.646 --> 34:55.478
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

34:55.549 --> 34:58.609
You have got to stop messing around
and deal with the problem!

34:58.686 --> 35:00.278
- She's right!
- Abby, please.

35:00.354 --> 35:02.618
This is exactly what
fell on me the first time.

35:02.690 --> 35:04.988
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.287
- No, he's not.
- Runt!

35:06.360 --> 35:08.794
Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.

35:08.863 --> 35:12.458
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.

35:12.533 --> 35:14.865
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

35:14.935 --> 35:18.496
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

35:18.572 --> 35:21.234
I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.

35:21.308 --> 35:23.037
Everything back to normal.

35:24.812 --> 35:28.714
Hey, remember when
that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

35:28.783 --> 35:31.377
Everybody thought it was
from space and stuff?

35:31.452 --> 35:35.912
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

35:35.990 --> 35:38.754
Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee.

35:38.826 --> 35:42.159
Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

35:42.229 --> 35:44.697
- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?

35:44.765 --> 35:45.925
- Pee.
- Tinkle?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.228
- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?

35:47.301 --> 35:48.859
OK, subject change.

35:50.337 --> 35:52.737
- Make pishee?
- I don't care what it is!

35:54.842 --> 35:57.936
Are you gonna
help me get rid of it or not?

36:16.964 --> 36:19.933
Flying Fish! Take cover!

36:20.000 --> 36:21.331
Fish!

36:23.704 --> 36:25.228
- No!
- Fish!

36:35.216 --> 36:37.616
Aaah!

36:37.685 --> 36:38.319
Come on, come on, come on!

36:39.753 --> 36:43.120
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?

36:43.791 --> 36:48.091
Chicken Little has something
to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

36:50.397 --> 36:51.989
Who're we talkin' about?

36:52.066 --> 36:54.057
Uh...

36:54.135 --> 36:55.466
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

36:56.237 --> 36:59.104
Ha! You got to be ready
to listen to your children,

36:59.173 --> 37:01.767
even if they have nothing to say.

37:03.410 --> 37:07.073
- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!

37:07.148 --> 37:09.082
Yeah!

37:13.454 --> 37:15.718
I'm sorry! Wait!

37:18.792 --> 37:19.986
Sorry!

37:20.861 --> 37:23.125
- Curb!
- Ay!

37:51.025 --> 37:52.890
Fish!

38:58.959 --> 39:00.290
Abby!

39:00.361 --> 39:02.090
Abby! Wake up!

39:04.098 --> 39:06.362
Come on! Let's get outta here!

39:54.348 --> 39:55.679
Oh, poor Fish!

39:55.749 --> 39:59.412
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...

39:59.486 --> 40:01.454
...maybe he's a half-living host

40:01.522 --> 40:05.583
implanted with
their face-hugging embryo babies.

40:05.659 --> 40:08.457
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!

40:08.529 --> 40:11.225
- Gone, man!
- Not yet!

40:15.202 --> 40:17.466
Oh, snap.

40:40.894 --> 40:42.725
Fish.

41:20.434 --> 41:23.801
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!

41:34.481 --> 41:36.381
Fish.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.441
Fish.

41:38.519 --> 41:39.816
Fish.

41:40.162 --> 41:41.595
Fish.

41:41.663 --> 41:44.655
- Where are you, Fish?!
- Shh!

41:44.733 --> 41:47.293
I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!

41:47.369 --> 41:48.859
- Runt.
- You're just fine.

41:48.937 --> 41:51.303
I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!

41:51.373 --> 41:53.933
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!

41:54.009 --> 41:57.172
Just leave me some ammo, little water,

41:57.245 --> 41:58.644
some chips if you have 'em.

41:58.714 --> 42:00.341
Calm. OK, all right. Listen.

42:00.415 --> 42:02.383
- Where's your bag?
- Everything's OK.

42:02.451 --> 42:05.682
- Now breathe.
- Breathe.

42:05.754 --> 42:07.654
- No, slowly.
- Slowly.

42:07.723 --> 42:09.054
Slowly.

42:09.124 --> 42:13.561
OK. Now, just do the thing
you do to relax.

42:31.346 --> 42:32.472
Aaah!

42:43.091 --> 42:44.649
Fish!

42:45.627 --> 42:47.527
Fish! Are you OK?

42:47.596 --> 42:49.427
Did they hurt you? Say something!

42:49.498 --> 42:52.228
Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.894
All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?

43:21.797 --> 43:23.196
We're next.

43:25.867 --> 43:28.597
Run!

43:28.670 --> 43:30.035
OK! That's it!

43:30.105 --> 43:32.471
We're running back
to your house. Tell your dad!

43:32.541 --> 43:34.202
OK! You're right, you're right!

44:06.508 --> 44:08.806
Oh, Runt!

44:09.578 --> 44:11.546
Push! Push! No!

44:11.613 --> 44:16.016
- Runt!
- No! Not pull! Push!

44:16.084 --> 44:18.644
We gotta get outta here
right now! Come on...

44:18.720 --> 44:21.484
No! Come on, you guys! Hu...

44:21.556 --> 44:23.888
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

44:23.959 --> 44:25.654
OK, time out!

44:25.727 --> 44:30.357
So... have
you been to the mall?

44:38.406 --> 44:40.340
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

44:40.408 --> 44:41.636
I'm sorry.

44:41.710 --> 44:43.575
Tension makes me bloat.

44:51.620 --> 44:54.180
Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

45:25.654 --> 45:27.121
Look out!

45:27.188 --> 45:31.420
Thanks! Curse these
genetically tiny legs!

45:31.493 --> 45:34.360
Ohh! Aah!

46:15.070 --> 46:16.628
What's that noise?

46:18.540 --> 46:20.872
Sorry. Nervous eater.

46:24.512 --> 46:27.140
- Run!
- Wait! Fish!

46:31.920 --> 46:33.817
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

46:33.852 --> 46:35.714
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

46:36.424 --> 46:37.755
Come on!

46:53.508 --> 46:55.499
Hurry! Hurry!

46:58.380 --> 46:59.711
Go! Go!

47:01.750 --> 47:03.240
Aaah!

47:21.202 --> 47:22.294
It's locked!

47:23.638 --> 47:25.105
They're... they're comin'.

47:29.744 --> 47:31.644
I need a soda.

47:33.648 --> 47:35.411
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy!

47:35.483 --> 47:37.951
- The corner's wrinkled!
- Why are we doing this?

47:41.423 --> 47:43.721
Come on, take it, take it!

47:43.792 --> 47:44.918
Yes!

47:47.328 --> 47:49.193
Come on! Work! Work!

47:49.264 --> 47:51.732
Work! You work!

47:53.668 --> 47:56.466
What happened?
I blacked out there for a second.

47:58.940 --> 48:00.066
Ah!

48:17.325 --> 48:21.318
<i>The sky is falling!</i>
<i>The sky is falling!</i>

48:21.396 --> 48:24.058
<i>It was just an acorn.</i>
<i>A little acorn!</i>

48:24.132 --> 48:26.623
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>how embarrassed I am, folks.</i>

48:27.702 --> 48:29.966
Ring the bell!

48:31.106 --> 48:33.438
Come on, Chicken Little!
Ring the bell!

48:57.966 --> 49:03.666
Huh? What?
Oh!

49:03.771 --> 49:05.602
<i> Now the weather with Riz.</i>

49:05.640 --> 49:07.232
<i>A cold front is moving in so...</i>

49:07.308 --> 49:10.471
<i>The alarm bell has been activated!</i>
<i>Quick! Get a camera crew!</i>

49:27.395 --> 49:31.263
Chicken Little! You better have
a good explanation for this!

49:31.332 --> 49:34.529
There's, there's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh! Doo wah!

49:34.602 --> 49:35.899
What did he say?

49:35.970 --> 49:38.803
There's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh... Doo wah.

49:38.873 --> 49:43.037
Follow me! Come on!
Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here!

49:43.111 --> 49:45.045
Aliens here!

49:46.381 --> 49:49.043
It's... it's happening again.

49:49.117 --> 49:51.813
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

49:54.622 --> 49:57.614
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!

50:00.395 --> 50:02.192
Quick! It's taking off!

50:02.263 --> 50:04.754
Come on! If you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!

50:04.832 --> 50:06.993
Oh, look! A penny!

50:07.068 --> 50:10.060
- Guys!
- Oh, right.

50:13.875 --> 50:16.810
Hurry! Hurry!

50:18.179 --> 50:20.079
Come on! Quick! It's taking off!

50:20.148 --> 50:22.776
Come on! Hurry up!
Please! It's right in...

50:24.619 --> 50:26.087
What are we lookin' for?

50:26.588 --> 50:29.853
I don't know.

50:29.924 --> 50:32.188
Uh, yeah. OK.
I know this looks bad,

50:32.260 --> 50:35.161
but there's an invisible
spaceship right there

50:35.230 --> 50:37.391
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!

50:37.465 --> 50:39.763
Let me show you.

50:41.102 --> 50:42.194
Ooh, bad throw.

50:42.270 --> 50:44.261
OK, let me try again.

50:44.339 --> 50:47.035
- Bad throw.
- We all know I don't have a good arm,

50:47.108 --> 50:49.599
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.

50:49.677 --> 50:53.408
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.

50:53.481 --> 50:56.245
Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.

50:56.317 --> 50:57.682
Eh, there's no story here.

50:57.752 --> 51:00.380
At least we can sell the video
to <i>Chickens Gone Wild.</i>

51:00.488 --> 51:03.946
- I'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!

51:03.992 --> 51:07.428
It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!

51:07.495 --> 51:10.555
And maps with planets
with X's through them! Aah!

51:10.632 --> 51:12.099
Runt, that's enough!

51:12.166 --> 51:15.158
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!

51:15.236 --> 51:18.103
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

51:18.172 --> 51:21.801
Why can't you keep
that child of yours under control?

51:21.876 --> 51:23.275
What kind of parent are you?

51:23.344 --> 51:25.369
I'm telling the truth.

51:25.446 --> 51:30.179
Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!

51:30.251 --> 51:32.811
You gotta believe me this time.

51:42.297 --> 51:45.733
No, son. I don't.

51:48.503 --> 51:52.337
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

51:52.407 --> 51:55.638
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.

51:55.710 --> 52:01.706
Looks like this is just
a big, crazy misunderstanding.

52:01.783 --> 52:06.220
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!

52:06.287 --> 52:12.021
Mr. Cluck, don't take it
so hard. No one blames you.

53:24.298 --> 53:27.028
<i> Reports of panic</i>
<i>and mayhem are pouring in</i>

53:27.100 --> 53:29.933
<i>after yet another Chicken Little</i>
<i>incident last night.</i>

53:30.003 --> 53:33.166
<i>In one instance, a family</i>
<i>of lemmings was sent running in fear,</i>

53:33.240 --> 53:36.676
<i>but unable to find a cliff, they</i>
<i>instead began throwing themselves</i>

53:37.878 --> 53:40.278
<i>- From the nearest park bench.</i>
- Hello? I'm sorry.

53:40.347 --> 53:42.542
Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me a break!

53:42.616 --> 53:45.312
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.

53:45.385 --> 53:48.548
I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.

53:48.622 --> 53:51.989
<i>- You have hate mail.</i>
- Sorry. That wasn't very funny.

53:52.059 --> 53:55.620
<i>- You have more hate mail.</i>
- Hi. What are you saying, sir?

53:55.696 --> 53:57.721
<i>Your hate mail box is full.</i>

53:57.798 --> 54:01.131
Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there.

54:01.201 --> 54:05.262
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?

54:05.339 --> 54:08.274
Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah?

54:08.342 --> 54:12.005
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'd like to see you try.

54:12.079 --> 54:14.946
OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.

54:15.015 --> 54:18.280
Hello? Really. Well...

54:34.601 --> 54:38.196
If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad...

54:38.271 --> 54:40.432
...it's now.

54:43.443 --> 54:45.274
It's too late for that.

54:46.813 --> 54:50.806
It's too late, baby, now it's too late.

54:50.884 --> 54:53.819
Though they
really did try to make it.

54:53.887 --> 54:55.514
Runt.

54:56.356 --> 54:57.914
Just think about it.

54:57.991 --> 55:01.654
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide

55:01.728 --> 55:06.461
and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no.

55:10.103 --> 55:13.038
Runt, I really just want
to be alone right now.

55:22.182 --> 55:25.583
Oh! Abby! Runt! Fish!

55:25.652 --> 55:28.485
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!

55:28.555 --> 55:30.546
- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!

55:39.966 --> 55:42.127
- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?

55:42.202 --> 55:43.829
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

55:45.872 --> 55:47.931
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.

55:48.007 --> 55:52.341
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.

55:52.412 --> 55:55.040
Here, blow.

55:55.114 --> 55:57.548
OK.

56:04.324 --> 56:08.420
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.

56:08.494 --> 56:10.485
Ah-choo!

57:01.414 --> 57:02.574
Whoa.

57:02.649 --> 57:03.707
Run!

57:15.862 --> 57:18.126
Those are your parents?

57:18.197 --> 57:20.893
And they brought the galactic armada?

57:24.871 --> 57:28.466
- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.

57:28.541 --> 57:30.338
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

57:30.410 --> 57:33.777
I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.

57:33.846 --> 57:34.938
Look up! There it is!

57:35.014 --> 57:37.141
Dad, you know, about that...

57:37.216 --> 57:39.912
- It's actually a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?

57:39.986 --> 57:42.784
This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!

57:42.855 --> 57:45.517
We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who else will?

57:45.591 --> 57:47.320
What?!

57:47.393 --> 57:48.485
Ugh!

57:48.561 --> 57:51.962
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

57:52.031 --> 57:53.623
Son!

57:53.700 --> 57:57.659
Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little!

57:57.737 --> 58:00.467
Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth!

58:00.540 --> 58:01.700
He is!

58:01.774 --> 58:04.709
Given his track record, we understand
why you don't believe him!

58:50.990 --> 58:55.757
Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!
Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!

59:12.011 --> 59:13.205
Whew!

59:18.985 --> 59:19.999
Chicken Little!

59:20.034 --> 59:21.014
Chicken Little!

59:21.087 --> 59:22.748
What? Where's your head?

59:22.822 --> 59:24.949
We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Come...

59:25.024 --> 59:27.720
- You, with the running and the jumping!
- Dad. No, wait.

59:27.794 --> 59:30.228
What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!

59:30.296 --> 59:32.127
It's like <i>War of the Worlds</i> out there!

59:32.198 --> 59:34.689
- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for one second!

59:34.767 --> 59:36.962
- It's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!

59:37.036 --> 59:40.631
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?

59:43.109 --> 59:45.202
- You're never there for me!
- What?

59:45.278 --> 59:47.212
OK, that's not
what I had in mind, but...

59:47.280 --> 59:49.271
You're never there for me. I mean,

59:49.348 --> 59:52.511
you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.

59:52.585 --> 59:54.416
And not at the ball field and not now!

59:54.487 --> 59:56.387
This is good! Keep going. Keep going!

59:56.456 --> 59:58.720
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.

59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.885
We have to talk because
<i>Modern Mallard</i> says avoiding closure

01:00:01.961 --> 01:00:03.929
can lead to molting. I'm already small

01:00:03.996 --> 01:00:06.624
and I don't think
I could handle being bald!

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.164
I...

01:00:10.236 --> 01:00:13.672
I... I didn't...

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:16.469
...realize, son.

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:20.103
I-I never meant to...

01:00:20.179 --> 01:00:23.307
The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole...

01:00:26.152 --> 01:00:29.019
You're right. You're right.

01:00:35.228 --> 01:00:38.254
Y... Your mom, she was...

01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:42.324
You know, she was always good
with stuff like this.

01:00:45.738 --> 01:00:48.730
Me...

01:00:48.808 --> 01:00:51.038
...I’m gonna need a lot of work.

01:00:53.246 --> 01:00:55.908
But you need to know that I love you,

01:00:55.982 --> 01:00:58.542
no matter what.

01:00:58.618 --> 01:01:01.018
And I'm sorry I...

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:09.155
And I'm sorry if I ever made
you feel like that was something...

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.192
...you had to earn.

01:01:23.409 --> 01:01:25.070
Uh... uh...

01:01:28.047 --> 01:01:30.311
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.

01:01:30.383 --> 01:01:32.248
OK, Dad.

01:01:32.318 --> 01:01:33.534
All we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:34.751
All we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

01:01:38.925 --> 01:01:41.416
Return this whatever it is?

01:01:41.494 --> 01:01:44.224
This is crazy! Crazy!

01:01:44.297 --> 01:01:46.060
Crazy wonderful!

01:01:46.132 --> 01:01:48.157
Just tell me what you need me to do.

01:01:48.234 --> 01:01:51.726
- Do you really mean it?
- You bet! Anything, son.

01:01:53.072 --> 01:01:56.508
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!

01:01:58.377 --> 01:02:01.540
Crazy supportive. That's me! Ohh!

01:02:01.614 --> 01:02:04.913
This thing likes to nibble,
doesn't it?

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.622
By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!

01:02:19.665 --> 01:02:23.567
Now that's closure.

01:02:26.806 --> 01:02:29.604
Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!

01:02:33.779 --> 01:02:37.237
Oh, they've given her
an alien mind-wipe!

01:02:37.316 --> 01:02:39.011
Aaah!

01:02:39.852 --> 01:02:41.547
OK, son. What do we do now?

01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:43.452
Uh, OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.

01:02:43.522 --> 01:02:47.219
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.

01:02:49.328 --> 01:02:52.627
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!

01:02:52.698 --> 01:02:54.825
Key to my car?

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.494
Tic Tac?

01:02:59.372 --> 01:03:01.340
Forget plan A!

01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:06.109
Uh-oh.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.785
OK, OK, what now, son?

01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:22.293
Who, by the way, I support 100 percent.

01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:25.524
- Uh, plan B?
- Ha-ha! Of course! Plan B!

01:03:25.598 --> 01:03:28.362
What is plan B?

01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:31.062
What? You have to go
to the bathroom? You want juice?

01:03:31.137 --> 01:03:33.196
A snack? Corn dog on a stick?

01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:35.433
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!

01:03:35.508 --> 01:03:37.772
I stink at this. I'm a horrible father.

01:03:37.843 --> 01:03:40.175
No, no, I am.

01:03:42.548 --> 01:03:44.812
Poo-tee-tah.

01:03:46.218 --> 01:03:47.776
Oh. Is that your parents?

01:03:47.853 --> 01:03:49.821
Pooteetah, pooteetah.

01:03:49.889 --> 01:03:51.720
That's it, Dad! Plan B!

01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:54.954
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square

01:03:55.027 --> 01:03:57.359
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.660
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof

01:03:59.732 --> 01:04:01.632
and give the kid back to its parents.

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.835
Yeah!

01:04:06.906 --> 01:04:08.931
Charge!

01:04:15.748 --> 01:04:17.978
Wow!

01:04:29.395 --> 01:04:31.590
A-ha!

01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:35.156
Now that's what I call
takin' out the trash!

01:04:44.443 --> 01:04:46.434
OK, son. Now what?

01:04:46.512 --> 01:04:47.774
Fire truck!

01:04:52.585 --> 01:04:54.553
Plan C!

01:04:58.357 --> 01:05:00.621
Runt, no! Turn around!

01:05:00.693 --> 01:05:03.719
- Go back to Town Hall!
- But they'll vaporize us!

01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:08.629
- You want me to do what?
- Runt, just do it! It'll work!

01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:10.692
We'll survive!

01:05:11.737 --> 01:05:14.501
I will survive?

01:05:14.573 --> 01:05:16.268
Brake, Abby!

01:05:16.342 --> 01:05:18.037
OK.

01:05:18.711 --> 01:05:21.179
- Floor it!
- Boink.

01:05:24.784 --> 01:05:26.979
Deploy ladder, Fish!

01:05:45.304 --> 01:05:47.204
- Plan D.
- Plan D!

01:05:47.273 --> 01:05:48.763
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:52.333
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.

01:05:52.411 --> 01:05:55.608
But loving you!

01:05:55.681 --> 01:05:57.080
Full support!

01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:08.653
I can't get out! Come back, son!

01:06:08.727 --> 01:06:10.786
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.

01:06:10.863 --> 01:06:13.127
- No, Dad, I can do this!
- It's too dangerous.

01:06:13.199 --> 01:06:15.224
I can do this. I can.

01:06:16.402 --> 01:06:18.666
You gotta believe me this time.

01:06:18.737 --> 01:06:20.295
I...

01:06:22.775 --> 01:06:24.640
I do, son.

01:06:26.512 --> 01:06:29.208
OK, hang on tight.

01:06:37.189 --> 01:06:40.818
- Yes!
- Here's your kid! Look over here!

01:06:40.893 --> 01:06:42.554
Here's your kid!

01:06:42.628 --> 01:06:44.323
He's OK!

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:54.169
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!

01:06:55.207 --> 01:06:57.175
Son! Son!

01:06:59.612 --> 01:07:01.876
Aaaah!

01:07:05.484 --> 01:07:08.783
- I'm here, son!
- Dad! Look out!

01:07:08.854 --> 01:07:11.789
Get away from my boy! Get away!

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:20.426
The mighty Acorns...

01:07:30.009 --> 01:07:32.034
Tic Tac?

01:07:34.313 --> 01:07:37.009
Why did you take our child?

01:07:37.082 --> 01:07:40.677
Hey, hey! Just...
Just hold on there, buddy!

01:07:40.753 --> 01:07:42.948
My son did not take your kid!

01:07:43.022 --> 01:07:44.922
You were the one
that left him behind!

01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:47.788
That's bad parenting! And I should know!

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.987
Silence!

01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:53.130
Release the child!

01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:55.325
- OK.
- OK, OK.

01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:03.431
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
I'm so happy to see you! My darling!

01:08:03.509 --> 01:08:06.444
- That was close.
- At least they're back together.

01:08:06.512 --> 01:08:08.036
They got their kid.

01:08:08.113 --> 01:08:12.140
You have violated
intergalactic law 90210!

01:08:12.217 --> 01:08:17.245
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:22.660
Oh, snap.

01:08:25.197 --> 01:08:27.495
Hmm? What's that?

01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:28.828
Hmm. I...

01:08:28.901 --> 01:08:31.165
I don't quite...

01:08:31.236 --> 01:08:34.728
Melvin, honey?
He's saying they're telling the truth.

01:08:34.807 --> 01:08:36.638
It was just a misunderstanding.

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:41.973
Well, then. This is awkward.

01:08:42.046 --> 01:08:44.015
- Yes, it is.
- I suppose I should...

01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:46.779
- Put the big guns away?
- Yes, yes.

01:08:46.852 --> 01:08:49.649
- Now put them down.
- Of course.

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:54.520
- And turn off your big voice.
- But I don't...

01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:56.082
- Turn it off.
- But...

01:08:56.161 --> 01:08:58.493
But I don't get to use
the big voice very often!

01:08:58.596 --> 01:09:00.087
Melvin.

01:09:00.131 --> 01:09:02.362
Yes, dear.

01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:10.670
Hi. Uh, anyone want
to try the big voice?

01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:17.741
Again,
I cannot tell you how sorry we are

01:09:17.816 --> 01:09:19.613
for this whole misunderstanding.

01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:22.017
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.

01:09:22.087 --> 01:09:24.520
We are. And if it hadn't
been for your son there,

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:27.319
well, we might have
vaporized the whole planet.

01:09:27.393 --> 01:09:28.553
What?

01:09:28.627 --> 01:09:30.890
Goodness! What a shame
that would have been.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:32.828
Where else would we pick our acorns?

01:09:32.898 --> 01:09:35.526
- We stop on the way to the in-laws.
- Every year.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.764
Looked on all the other planets.
You only find them on Earth.

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:41.670
Just as it says here
on your primitive graphic display.

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.935
That caught our eyes.

01:09:44.009 --> 01:09:46.738
OK, everything's been
put back to normal,

01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:49.006
except for this one, over here.

01:09:49.081 --> 01:09:50.548
Hi, y'all!

01:09:50.616 --> 01:09:51.912
Foxy?

01:09:55.988 --> 01:09:59.446
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.

01:09:59.525 --> 01:10:01.891
No worries! We can put
her back the way she was.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.485
No! She's perfect.

01:10:06.532 --> 01:10:08.932
- Scary.
- Whoops!

01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:11.526
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.

01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:14.503
All right, then.
It was good meetin' ya.

01:10:14.573 --> 01:10:17.406
Sorry for the whole
full-scale invasion thing.

01:10:17.476 --> 01:10:20.934
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.

01:10:21.013 --> 01:10:25.109
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.

01:10:27.486 --> 01:10:31.149
There goes that panel again.

01:10:31.223 --> 01:10:33.282
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:36.054
Someday it's going
to hit somebody on the head.

01:10:36.128 --> 01:10:37.823
Nonsense!

01:10:37.896 --> 01:10:39.386
You can't return the panel.

01:10:39.465 --> 01:10:42.593
- Now that's ridiculous.
- You threw away the receipt again.

01:10:42.668 --> 01:10:44.135
Silence!

01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:47.331
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?

01:10:47.406 --> 01:10:50.307
Um... uh...

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.240
Who we talkin' about?

01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:56.509
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.305
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:00.942
I just hope they stay true
to what really happened.

01:11:00.986 --> 01:11:02.383
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

01:11:02.418 --> 01:11:03.781
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

01:11:03.855 --> 01:11:05.914
One thing they'll never do

01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:07.490
is mess with a good story.

01:11:07.525 --> 01:11:08.989
Is mess with a good story.

01:11:11.162 --> 01:11:13.323
Red alert!
Man your battle stations!

01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:16.094
Status report, Mr. Fish.

01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:18.567
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army

01:11:18.636 --> 01:11:21.127
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.

01:11:21.205 --> 01:11:23.639
But that means...

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:27.838
Yes, I know. The sky... is falling.

01:11:27.912 --> 01:11:29.607
Commander Little! No!

01:11:29.681 --> 01:11:32.707
Please... call me...

01:11:32.784 --> 01:11:34.012
...Ace.

01:11:34.085 --> 01:11:35.814
Oh, Ace! No!

01:11:35.887 --> 01:11:40.187
I never intended to
bring you into this... Abby.

01:11:40.258 --> 01:11:42.590
- Runt, do you copy?
<i>- Yes, commander?</i>

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:46.756
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.

01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:50.460
Civilization as we know it depends on me

01:11:50.535 --> 01:11:54.198
and, to a lesser extent... you.

01:11:54.272 --> 01:11:57.833
So I've just got one question for you:

01:11:57.909 --> 01:12:00.400
Are you ready to rock?

01:12:00.478 --> 01:12:05.006
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...

01:12:07.819 --> 01:12:11.084
Raise your pork shield,
Runt. Prepare to engage.

01:12:15.426 --> 01:12:17.860
<i> Stay on target. Stay on target!</i>

01:12:17.929 --> 01:12:20.591
<i>Give 'em a taste</i>
<i>of the other white meat!</i>

01:12:20.665 --> 01:12:22.929
<i>- Cap'n! Look out!</i>

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.989
<i> Runt!</i>

01:12:24.068 --> 01:12:25.592
<i>Runt, are you all right?</i>

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:29.800
<i> No, no. Ya gotta</i>
<i>go on without me, commander.</i>

01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:35.668
<i>Just leave me some ammo, a little water,</i>

01:12:35.747 --> 01:12:37.715
<i>some chips if you have 'em.</i>

01:12:37.782 --> 01:12:40.615
This is amazingly accurate.

01:12:43.554 --> 01:12:46.455
<i>He was my good friend.</i>

01:12:46.524 --> 01:12:48.219
<i>Oh, Abby.</i>

01:12:48.292 --> 01:12:51.887
<i>At least I still have you... Abby.</i>

01:12:51.963 --> 01:12:53.954
<i>- Ace!</i>
<i>- Abby.</i>

01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:57.592
<i>- Ace!</i>
<i>- Abby.</i>

01:12:57.668 --> 01:12:59.568
<i>Ace!</i>

01:13:00.772 --> 01:13:03.104
<i>Good people of Oakey Oaks.</i>

01:13:03.174 --> 01:13:07.736
<i>Though at times it may feel</i>
<i>like the sky is falling around you,</i>

01:13:07.812 --> 01:13:09.177
<i>never give up.</i>

01:13:09.247 --> 01:13:13.741
<i>For every day... is a new day!</i>

01:13:13.818 --> 01:13:16.912
<i> A new day!</i>

01:13:21.726 --> 01:13:23.250
<i>Oh, Ace!</i>

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.057
Come on, Runt. You can do it.

01:15:38.129 --> 01:15:41.758
<i>I won't go breaking your heart</i>

01:15:43.768 --> 01:15:47.397
You got to act quickly, Dad. Try this.

01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:49.268
There you go!

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.205
There it is!

01:15:53.144 --> 01:15:56.341
I'm having fun now!

01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.846
That was great!

01:16:01.919 --> 01:16:04.581
Let's sing it again!
