10:13.380 --> 10:16.147
<i>"What other clients you got that
I can just hop on a plane...</i>

10:16.149 --> 10:19.651
- Really?
<i>- ...and, and go work with." She chose you.</i>

10:19.653 --> 10:21.019
Really?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.287
[Leonard] I don't wanna
put you off your stroke.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.156
- [Iris] Oh.
- Ha ha, boom!

10:25.158 --> 10:27.959
- Beat that.
- Are you joking? Right, rematch.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.960
[chuckles]

10:28.962 --> 10:30.829
Leonard, man, oi.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.965
I had a note to bring
these by here today.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.668
Jackie's gone out
and I was told bring these here.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.638
Well, Jackie is at the hospital,
I thought you were--

10:39.640 --> 10:41.806
- What's she doing at the hospital?
- Well, she's gone to see Mary.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.076
- [Iris] Has she?
- Oh, of course, 'cause of the, 'cause of her--

10:45.078 --> 10:49.214
- Why did Jackie go and see mum?
- Because she's-- Well, because she's her sister.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.182
Why didn't you just come down
with Jackie this morning?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.218
[Keith] Why aren't you working
anyway? Middle of the day,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.153
- chucking balls around here.
- [Leonard] Well, she has been working,

10:55.155 --> 10:57.322
- tell him your news, tell him your news.
- Dad's actually, um,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.724
pretty proud of me at the moment,
'cause I've got some massive news.

10:59.726 --> 11:03.094
- Hm.
- I've got this full length, feature length film,

11:03.096 --> 11:05.230
a Hollywood budget, £10 million,

11:05.232 --> 11:08.166
it features Timothy Edwards
and Charlotte Carol.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.969
When the credits come down,
and if you play your cards right,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.404
you'll be invited
to the premiere.

11:12.406 --> 11:16.341
Who's name is gonna be
on the titles? Iris.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.842
- Nice, it's great, yeah.
- [Iris] Yeah.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.845
You seem quite up
about it, kind of, "Ooh."

11:20.847 --> 11:22.347
- [Leonard] Oh yeah. You'll have to tell Jackie.
- [Iris] I'm so excited.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.816
[Keith] It's a bit
insensitive though, aint it?

11:24.818 --> 11:26.418
Telling me all that,
trying to get me all,

11:26.420 --> 11:28.987
- "Oh, look, we're all excited."
- Well, it is exciting.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.855
- We're all excited about that, and your mother's in hospital.
- What are you talking--

11:30.857 --> 11:32.857
- Keith.
- Your mum's there in hospital, lying there, like,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.426
- beep, beep, beep, and you're like,
- Keith.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.761
- "Ooh, look at me,
making it rain, my $10 million."

11:36.763 --> 11:38.063
[Leonard] Keith, that's enough.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.265
[doorbell ringing]

11:40.267 --> 11:42.834
[Leonard] Door! Hey!

11:42.836 --> 11:44.969
- Come on in.
- Dad. Hey!

11:44.971 --> 11:48.273
- How are you?
- Oh, my god, how are you?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.141
- Come on in.
- Take the weight off--

11:50.143 --> 11:51.509
Oh, sister!

11:51.511 --> 11:53.111
Oh, a bit of sister love.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.479
[chuckling]

11:54.481 --> 11:56.181
- Oh, my god.
- I've got mince all over me,

11:56.183 --> 11:57.282
I don't wanna get it on you.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.516
Yeah, careful with that carrot.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.518
Since when have
you cooked, Iris?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.153
- Do you wanna come help?
- Yeah, of course.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.855
- I'll come help or I'll try.
- Let me take this.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.090
- Are you trying to do mum's recipe?
- Yeah.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.291
[Abby] It's so watery.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.059
- It's liquid.
- No, it's not.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.961
- Abs, do you want a drink or anything?
- It's runny.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.429
I've actually got you some <i> vino.</i>

12:11.431 --> 12:13.064
[Leonard] Shall I, do you
wanna come and sit down?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.999
- Want you-- Want you vino?
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.735
Okay, we're catching up,

12:16.737 --> 12:17.535
as I've got a million
different things to tell you.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.503
[Keith] Alright!

12:19.840 --> 12:22.474
- Keith.
- I'm cooked in here, aint it?

12:22.476 --> 12:25.076
- Yes. Oh, really?
- Yeah, Keith's here.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.545
- I see that.
- Good old Keith.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.080
- Alright?
- Hm.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.049
[Abby] How's aunt Jackie, Keith?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.752
- Alright.
- Haven't seen her, I think she's--

12:33.754 --> 12:35.253
- Why, dad?
- I don't know,

12:35.255 --> 12:36.287
- he just showed up.
- I haven't seen you in ages.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.089
He came round with boules.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.023
Yeah, it annoys you guys.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.825
Come here. Mm.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.494
- You always kiss me.
- Ah.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.796
- OK. Let me say what I wanted to talk about.
- Yeah.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.065
- So good to see you.
- [Leonard] I mean, mum sends her love, obviously.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.366
[Abby] Does she,
yeah, I wanna know.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.801
Iris told me a little
bit on the phone.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.269
- Yeah.
- I don't know why you didn't

12:51.271 --> 12:52.303
- call me.
- Well, I didn't want to--

12:52.305 --> 12:53.872
I didn't want to bother you,

12:53.874 --> 12:54.939
I mean, you're busy over
there and she's been--

12:54.941 --> 12:56.274
Yeah, but I'm not busy enough,

12:56.276 --> 12:57.909
like I am your eldest daughter.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.345
Yeah, nothing's changed,
I mean, she's--

13:00.347 --> 13:01.813
She's okay, she's okay.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.015
Thanks. Always.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.250
Glass of <i> vino.</i>

13:05.252 --> 13:06.885
- Thanks, Iris.
- Oh, thank you.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.219
- For our lady.
- Where did you get--

13:08.221 --> 13:10.522
Lots of talking,
not much cooking going on.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.157
- I'm just saying like.
- Thanks, Keith.

13:12.159 --> 13:16.594
<i>Take advantage of an experience
that will never come along again.</i>

13:16.596 --> 13:19.798
- Wha-- What!
<i>- The most talented composer.</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:22.967
<i>The inventor of the genre.</i>

13:22.969 --> 13:25.403
- Yeah, um--
<i>- Romance comedy.</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:28.373
Duh, I know, wha-- what?

13:28.375 --> 13:32.477
<i>She would love to come,
drop in, just--</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:36.080
- Wait, hang on.
<i>- Big Eleanor Roberts tool chest.</i>

13:36.082 --> 13:39.117
<i>She's there for you to reach out</i>

13:39.119 --> 13:42.987
<i>and pull anything
out of her experience and--</i>

13:42.989 --> 13:45.256
<i>and help you get to the
place you-- you have to be,</i>

13:45.258 --> 13:47.392
<i>that you're clearly
struggling to get at.</i>

13:47.394 --> 13:50.895
I know this is like a weird
question, but is she nice? Like--

13:50.897 --> 13:53.531
<i>Well, not famously nice,
no, but, um--</i>

13:53.533 --> 13:56.034
<i>She's-- she's
pretty eccentric, she's--</i>

13:56.036 --> 13:59.604
- Really?
<i>- She's very creative, as you know.</i>

13:59.606 --> 14:02.073
<i>This is rather untypical of her,</i>

14:02.075 --> 14:05.210
<i>to be quite so giving,
to tell you the truth.</i>

14:05.212 --> 14:08.046
<i>So I think that's
a testament to your talent.</i>

14:08.048 --> 14:09.547
<i>- Uh--</i>
- Wow.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.082
<i>But she's got, uh--</i>

14:11.084 --> 14:13.585
<i>- she's got a huge heart. And--</i>
- Wow!

14:13.587 --> 14:17.555
- I-- I'm nervous.
<i>- She's got lots of experience she wants to share with you.</i>

14:17.557 --> 14:20.425
[Iris] Yeah, she does
have a lot of experience.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.594
- [Griffin] <i> Yeah.</i>
- I mean, with everything.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.930
- [Griffin chuckles] <i> Well, she's had a life.</i>
- [Iris chuckles]

14:26.867 --> 14:30.268
<i>This is a-- a genre that--
that she practically invented,</i>

14:30.270 --> 14:31.936
<i>the sound of romantic comedy,</i>

14:31.938 --> 14:34.339
<i>and she just wants
to sort of help.</i>

14:34.341 --> 14:37.675
<i>Just don't sleep with her,
things get really complicated after that.</i>

14:37.677 --> 14:40.311
- What? Griff.
- [laughing] <i> Never mind.</i>

14:40.313 --> 14:42.347
- [lady] You never lock the door?
- Keith, give the lady some space.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.949
- Hi. I'm Abby. Iris' big sister. Yeah.
- Hi.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.318
- Oh, my god. You're so pretty.
- [Keith] I'll close the door. Shall I stay in

14:47.320 --> 14:48.887
- or close the door? Close the door, yeah, probably.
- [Abby] Thank you.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.289
- Iris!
- Dad! Dad, you'll never guess what,

14:51.291 --> 14:54.025
Eleanor Roberts wants
to work with me!

14:54.027 --> 14:56.461
- Oh, hi. You're Iris?
- [Iris] Oh, my god.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.429
Yeah, I'm Iris.
What are you doing here?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.398
- My god, I just--
- No, no, I just got off the phone with Griff.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.666
Did you know who I, okay,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.234
'cause they didn't
know who I was,

15:03.236 --> 15:04.669
- and I just felt like I--
- Oh, okay, you came.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.471
Is this the wrong day,
is this the wrong day?

15:06.473 --> 15:09.407
No, he said that maybe you'd
wanna come on Thursday.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.708
I didn't realize
that you'd be here right now.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.210
What day is today?

15:12.212 --> 15:15.346
- It's Tuesday, but I'm so--
- Oh, fuck!

15:15.348 --> 15:18.016
Today, no way--
Oh fuck, oh fuck!

15:18.018 --> 15:20.652
- No, just tell me, wait, what is today?
- Tuesday.

15:20.654 --> 15:24.122
- Tuesday.
- Oh, fuck! You know, I jus-- Fucking whor-- I'm so sorry,

15:24.124 --> 15:28.192
I'm so sorry. I'm, I'm-- You guys
probably don't even swear, I'm so sorry.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.062
- I'm sorry.
- [Keith] I swear a bit, I swear a bit, like, shit, piss.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.965
What happened was he said
just go help this girl,

15:33.967 --> 15:35.466
she's in a lot
of fucking trouble,

15:35.468 --> 15:37.335
I mean, not that you're
in fucking trouble,

15:37.337 --> 15:39.404
'cause he says you're really
brilliant, you're really great,

15:39.406 --> 15:41.339
I can't believe
that you look like this

15:41.341 --> 15:43.241
and you're really that great,
but I'm sure you are.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.144
- She is very talented.
- Yeah, I'm sure, but guess what?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.712
- I think I need a drink.
- [Keith] Yes.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.113
- I can get you a drink.
- [Eleanor] You know why?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.682
- Yeah, wine?
- I'm-- I'm-- Yeah, okay.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.051
Actually Jack Daniels, oh,
did I decide Jack Daniels?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.987
- We actually-- we actually got--
- You know what?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.455
- Brandy, whatever you have.
- Would you like some coke?

15:57.457 --> 15:58.990
- Actually I'm freezing.
- Do you have a jacket?

15:58.992 --> 16:00.258
- Are you cold?
- No, you know what,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.260
I'm fine, I'll just
put my jacket on.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.728
- That's in the summerhouse, I've got--
- [Eleanor] Okay.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.763
- Well, thank you.
- It's alright, no problem.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.999
Have a nice-- Ah!

16:08.001 --> 16:09.701
- Ah, you got my nipple.
- I am so thirsty.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.102
- I'll bring one over.
- Alright.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.203
- Okay, thank you.
- Alright, guys,

16:12.205 --> 16:13.171
I'll see you in a bit.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.472
It's freezing out here,

16:14.474 --> 16:15.673
- I need a sweater or something.
- No, no.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.342
It's fine, I've got one
in there.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.143
Just saying, your daughter
proper twatted my nipple.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.245
- [Abby] Oh Keith.
- Well, I think you deserved it.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.147
What have I done?
I'm making her feel welcome.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.083
A kind of a licky right now.
A kind of a licky.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.452
If she doesn't mind,
what's the problem with it?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.787
I didn't put anything
in her, did I?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.422
It-- it pulls out
and there's a whole--

16:31.424 --> 16:33.224
- Oh, god, it's--
- Kind of throws on that.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.059
- Are you kidding? This is--
- You sort of like, you know.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.694
- [laughing] Oh!
- Just like that.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.497
Oh, my god, you have no idea
how much you've inspired me,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.065
it's like unbelievable, like,

16:41.067 --> 16:43.101
<i>My Body Can't Metabolize
My Excitement,</i>

16:43.103 --> 16:45.003
like that's one of my favorite
songs and I actually--

16:45.005 --> 16:47.505
<i>My Body Can't Metabolize</i>
<i>the Excitement I Crave,</i> yeah.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.474
<i>My Body Can't--</i>
Sorry, it's so embarrassing.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.542
<i>My Body Can't Metabolize
the Excitement I Crave.</i>

16:51.544 --> 16:53.311
It actually inspired the song

16:53.313 --> 16:56.214
that I was thinking
for the movie called, uh,

16:56.216 --> 16:59.417
<i>You Could Be the Person
I Choose to Suffer With.</i>

16:59.419 --> 17:00.818
Do you wanna just
like drum it out?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.420
What, now? You know what,

17:02.422 --> 17:03.521
- actually, I--
- Do you still,

17:03.523 --> 17:04.489
ever feel like that?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.156
I don't know.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.759
No, I don't ever feel
like drummin' it out, no.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.292
- It's like--
- [both screaming]

17:09.295 --> 17:10.560
Can I call you an icon?

17:11.765 --> 17:14.632
No, that's like
a thing on a computer.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.166
Can I call you my hero?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.805
Argh, Eleanor Roberts!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.673
Oh, my god!

17:22.675 --> 17:24.509
Like I just literally wanna
smash my guitar up for you.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.345
Okay, don't smash
your guitar, okay.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.311
[petanque boules clacking]

17:32.052 --> 17:33.551
[Leonard grunts]

17:36.623 --> 17:38.856
Oh, that was pretty good.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.231
- [in Australian accent] Good day, Sheila.
- Oh my.

- You doing well?

17:50.537 --> 17:51.836
Yes, mate, how are you?

17:51.838 --> 17:54.672

theme, I see,

17:54.674 --> 17:56.140

- God, you're annoying.

- [Iris sighs]

totally weirded out,

18:07.587 --> 18:09.587

bit weirded out, yeah,

18:09.589 --> 18:11.222

18:11.224 --> 18:12.890

in our summerhouse, mate?

18:12.892 --> 18:15.426
- This is my idol.
- I'm not even gonna pretend to know

18:15.428 --> 18:17.829
- what you're talking about.
- Don't you remember like,

18:17.831 --> 18:19.430
I had her posters on my wall,

18:19.432 --> 18:21.466
composed for some
of my favorite films,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.401

18:23.403 --> 18:24.535
- Eleanor Roberts.
- [Abby] Yeah, I've seen <i> Tomorrow,</i>

18:24.537 --> 18:25.870
I maybe watched that one, yeah.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.738
Literally like,
she's a living legend.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.607
So how long is she staying?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.409
You know mum's back
this afternoon?

18:31.411 --> 18:33.778
I do, I do know
mum's back this afternoon.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.380
Good, and by the way, I haven't
seen mum in three months.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.182

seen me in three months.

bit and address the situation.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.193
[Iris] But she says
she likes drinking wine,

18:49.195 --> 18:51.262
like in the middle of the night,
if she gets thirsty.

18:51.264 --> 18:54.465
What difficulties are you
having with your work?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.768

- Yeah.
- That's what I'm doing.

I've been having

19:31.638 --> 19:34.505

what the fuck to do.

Yeah.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.390
- Uh!
- Feeling alright?

31:00.392 --> 31:04.428
Yeah, I just-- just felt

That's before we did all
the work on the house.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.507
- Yeah.
- Do you remember that boat?

31:17.509 --> 31:19.309
Absolutely, your
grandad made that.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.612
Look at you two.

31:21.614 --> 31:23.914

- Those little faces.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.685
- You, dad?
- It's a boy.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.120
- Dad's dad.
- Grandad.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.521
- Is it?
- Yes. Yeah, can't you see?

31:31.523 --> 31:33.023
I mean, he does look
like dad, doesn't he?

31:33.025 --> 31:34.191
- He looked exactly--
- Looks like me.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.158
Yeah.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.362
That was on holiday. [gasps]

31:38.364 --> 31:41.565
- Two.
- Look at Abby trying to shove that lolly in my mouth.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.668
Yeah, she always had
a habit of doing that.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.539
So,

31:48.540 --> 31:50.374
when, um,
I went to the hospital,

31:51.243 --> 31:55.946
um, they said that they,
they can't rebalance things anymore.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.681
they've changed
my tablets around,

31:57.683 --> 32:00.117
they've tried different
combinations of everything

32:00.119 --> 32:03.553
and essentially what's happened
is that there is fluid

32:03.555 --> 32:05.455
that's building up
on, on the lungs,

32:05.457 --> 32:07.624

32:07.626 --> 32:09.226
Don't say that, mum.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.528
Okay.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.465
I need you to look after Daddy

32:16.669 --> 32:18.435
and Abigail, okay?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.640
I think this job's going
really well, you know?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.378
I think it's gonna be the start

32:28.380 --> 32:29.646
of a lot of really
exciting things.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.114
Iris, did you hear what I said?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.350
- I've just got like--
- Did you hear me?

32:33.352 --> 32:35.452
Yeah, I've got
like two more songs,

32:35.454 --> 32:36.720
that I need to get done.

32:36.722 --> 32:41.425
- Yeah, gonna be brilliant. Yeah.
- I mean, the exciting bits for you,

32:41.427 --> 32:44.027
is gonna be
when the credits roll down,

32:44.029 --> 32:45.028
and you see my name.

32:48.067 --> 32:48.999
Yep.

32:49.001 --> 32:52.069
[guitar playing]

33:43.288 --> 33:45.422
[Leonard] So how did you two
guys meet again?

33:45.424 --> 33:47.190
- Ah, it was about six--
- [Andrew] I've got this,

33:47.192 --> 33:48.625
I've got this. We, er--

33:48.627 --> 33:51.528
She wandered into
my gallery in Paris, saw me.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.730
[Abby] The most prestigious gallery
in Paris, by the way, it is.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.832
And I think it's fair to say

33:55.834 --> 33:59.236
she fell pretty quickly for me.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.072
I've got half a dozen
properties in Paris alone,

34:02.074 --> 34:03.373
couple of hundred
around the world really.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.042

34:05.044 --> 34:07.110
[Andrew] So I'm non-stop.

34:07.112 --> 34:08.678
- Okay, everyone.
- [Andrew] Uh, about five years--

34:08.679 --> 34:10.447
- Everyone. A little bit--
- Are you shushing me?

34:10.449 --> 34:13.750
A little bit of hush please.
Please, Iris, Iris.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.217
Eleanor?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.585
[Leonard] We're trying
to do a toast.

34:16.588 --> 34:19.356
We're just gonna--
We thought it's be lovely

34:19.358 --> 34:24.061
to do a toast
to our mum, who we love.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.228
[Iris] Toast to mummy.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.164
- So much.
- We love you so much.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.199
- Cheers, we love you so much, mum.
- And me.

34:30.202 --> 34:34.137
[overlapping conversations]

34:36.875 --> 34:39.543
I'm so glad you
got to meet Andrew,

34:40.344 --> 34:41.311
and, um--

34:42.313 --> 34:44.848
- I love you.
- I love you.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.882
- [Eleanor] Er, mine's a little too, yeah.
- [tapping on glass]

34:46.885 --> 34:49.553
Um, I'd like to make a toast,

34:49.554 --> 34:52.722
to the most gracious,

34:53.592 --> 34:56.092
generous, kind woman.

34:56.829 --> 35:00.530
I would have probably been,
okay, I'm saying it wrong,

35:00.532 --> 35:03.733
if I'd had a mum like you,

35:03.735 --> 35:07.104
I wouldn't be like I am,

35:07.106 --> 35:09.106
in a bad way,
you know what I mean?

35:09.108 --> 35:10.807
- [Iris] Yeah.
- [Eleanor] Like I'd just be--

35:10.809 --> 35:13.710
I'd just be better, 'cause
I never-- I never had that.

35:13.712 --> 35:17.247
So, I am so glad that
you guys have had that

35:17.249 --> 35:20.250
and I know I've gone on too
long, I'm sorry. [clears throat]

35:21.386 --> 35:23.653
[sighs] I'm just
a little drunk, sorry.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.821
But I do wanna say is

35:24.823 --> 35:27.524
that you have the most amazing,

35:27.526 --> 35:30.527
brilliant daughter.
- [all] Here, here. Yes.

35:30.529 --> 35:34.364
She is smart,
funny, sweet, kind.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.400
But really, really
fucking talented.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.603
Really fucking, oh, I'm sorry.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.438
- [Leonard] Language.
- [Eleanor] I'm so sorry,

35:41.440 --> 35:44.141
and really super-duper talented

35:44.143 --> 35:49.279
[chuckles] and I think
you are really--

35:49.281 --> 35:50.247
Um--

35:50.249 --> 35:54.484
Oh, god, sorry, I'm not--
I'm not really good with words,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.253
um-- um-- when people
are looking at me,

35:56.255 --> 35:58.955
I get really, okay, I'm sorry.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.191
You know what, actually I have
to go to the bathroom, um--

36:01.193 --> 36:03.226
And I love you,
is that weird to say?

36:03.228 --> 36:05.862
I just, I do,
excuse me, I'm so sorry.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.435
- Alright.
- She's about to hit the carpet.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.639
[overlapping conversations]

36:15.641 --> 36:17.507
[Iris] How did you
know we were here?

36:18.343 --> 36:20.844
- You're welcome.
- Keith, did you invite Bobby?

36:20.846 --> 36:23.313
- Yep.
- Yeah, is that a problem?

36:23.315 --> 36:25.282
[Iris] Why'd you guys even talk?

36:25.284 --> 36:26.683
- We always talk.
- [Bobby] We talk a lot.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.218
- Bobby.
- Why did we break up?

36:28.220 --> 36:29.553
Please leave.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.787
Do you really wanna
have this conversation

36:30.789 --> 36:32.422
- in front of mum and dad?
- Yes.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.657
I haven't actually
explained it fully

36:33.659 --> 36:34.991
to mum and dad yet, so maybe--

36:34.993 --> 36:37.827
I'm a changed man,
I've changed everything.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.864
A new outlook,
what I do, who I am,

36:42.301 --> 36:45.835
new hobbies. Keith knows.
Keith's the man.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.676
Come on, give it a go,
Keith says you're doing music

36:52.678 --> 36:54.711
and something's going on
with somebody else,

36:54.713 --> 36:57.681
- sounds very strange.
- Nothing's going on.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.684
Before I was not listening
to the music ironically.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.453
Okay, and now I hear it all
and I love fishing now,

37:03.455 --> 37:07.757
everything to do with aquariums,
fish, fish pumps, tank pumps.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.660
And that's been able
to help me make women happy.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.597
I'm a changed man,
I have changed.

37:14.566 --> 37:19.002
There is a lot of change
going on. There's a lot.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.772
And within that change
is change, and more change.

37:22.774 --> 37:26.509
- I used to be about cars, women, booze.
- [coughs]

37:26.511 --> 37:29.279
And I'm no longer
about that anymore.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.348
I like women, sure,
and booze, of course,

37:31.350 --> 37:32.882
but I don't like cars anymore.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.285
- [bartender] Whisky?
- [Eleanor] Just a wee, wee bit,

37:35.287 --> 37:38.588
- A little bit of whisky.
- A wee bit, a titch, just a titch.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.023
[laughter]

37:40.025 --> 37:42.359
- [man] I think you should stop.
- Good.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.427
[woman] I think
you can, like yeah,

37:44.429 --> 37:47.030
a good kiss is definitely a good
indication if somebody's gonna be right.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.365
- You okay?
- I can be a really good kisser

37:48.367 --> 37:49.599
- with one person.
- Yeah, Bobby.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.834
I can't kiss another person.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.335
You don't-- You don't seem okay.

37:52.337 --> 37:54.271
[Eleanor] You know what,
can I just say

37:54.273 --> 37:57.374
- this whole English thing.
- Is-- We're Welsh.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.975
You had to do that
though, didn't you?

37:58.977 --> 38:01.611
Yeah, I know, I'm kind of,
uh, sorry,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.046
immediately sorry about it.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.514
You made a bit of a scene
though, didn't you?

38:04.516 --> 38:06.049
- [muttering]
- You what?

38:06.051 --> 38:07.284
I'm sorry.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.488
- Sorry?
- Yeah, I'm very sorry.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.024
[Iris] Oh, 'cause you
did sleep with Tash.

38:14.893 --> 38:15.925
Look-- [sighs]

38:18.030 --> 38:19.062
Yeah.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.804
[Eleanor] Fucking mouth,
bring that mouth over here.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.772
Some funny business
going on over there,

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:30.078
[sighs]

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:37.285
I miss all of
our late night chats about

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:40.822
love and life
and the universe, and--

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.195
My mother, Mary Evans

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:54.569
was the kindest,

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:55.737
most thoughtful,

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:58.873
gorgeous woman

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:03.078
I've ever, I've ever known.

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:09.217
I know she's been
preparing us for this day,

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:12.787
me and Abs and Dad.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.296
So I know
what she would have wanted,

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:22.897
and what she does want, which is

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:26.301
for us to go out
into the world and

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.368
spread our wings and

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:32.707
find joy and happiness and

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:38.412
be together for the good
and the bad moments, and

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:43.451
all the shades in between,
and we're gonna do you proud, mum,

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.453
we're gonna be there
for each other, and

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:50.859
her memory will live on
in our hearts.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.629
I love you, mum.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:05.206
[crying]

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:14.381
- You came back.
- Hm-mm.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.638
- You want some tea?
- Yeah.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.876
[cutlery clinking]

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.313
- God, I feel so embarrassed.
- Well--

01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:48.816
It was all weird with you
in the summerhouse, eh?

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:51.685
- [sighs]
- Do you really wanna go there?

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:55.790
- [chuckles]
- I know, I just-- I'm not usually like that.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.959
I don't-- I don't know what came
over me, you know. It's just--

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:00.695
Suddenly it all came out and--

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.299
I'm so embarrassed and I don't
know what to say and then--

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:10.705
It was a little traumatizing,
I have to say. [chuckles]

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.675
But I'm working through it,
I have professionals to help me.

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:15.743
- Good.
- [laughs]

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:17.445
But, um, I actually, um--

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.615
I, uh--

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:25.486
I don't know, I just thought about
a lot of the things that went down,

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:28.890
and I feel like
the energy of us together--

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:32.794
We did something
that I couldn't have done alone,

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:34.562
and I don't think you
could have done alone,

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.898
and we did it together.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.902
I actually have written some of the
best songs I've ever written this week

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:44.739
and there's no way that I would
have been able to do that

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.376
at the worst time of my life,

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:51.779
have the best thing
also happen to me.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:53.848
You know, there's
something about

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.718
when somebody from the outside,

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.920
like somebody from Mars,
comes in

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.589
and they just decide
to believe in you.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.758
[melancholic song playing]

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.596
And you just decided to come out
of nowhere and believe in me.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.601
And the power of that is...

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:17.338
massive.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.640
Then listen to me,

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:20.275

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:50.938
I had Welsh cakes the other day.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.440
- Oh, yeah.
- They bought me,

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.442
they are quite dry,

about to get on the decks.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.579

- Yeah.
- The whole scenario.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:41.989
So, I've been thinking
after what mum said,

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:45.059
that I'm gonna spend
more time at home

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:47.395
- with you and dad.
- Really?

01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:48.830
Yeah.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.498
What do you think?

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.899
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:55.837
I think if that makes
you happy, then,

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:58.005
- it'll make me really happy.
- Good.

01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.177
- Done.
- Um.

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:06.848

day, he called me, and--

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:10.184
He was saying if I wanna go
to L.A. with the, you know--

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:13.755
- L.A.?
- L.A. Well, they're getting all my demos

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.556
in the orchestra room.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.392
- But, you know.
- You've got to do that.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:20.762
Yeah, but I kind of need
somebody to show me around,

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.663
somebody that's
been there, that--

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:25.666
You know,
that I loved and trusted.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:28.002
Is that
your roundabout way of...

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.704
- Would you?
- ...asking your big sister

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:31.172
to come to L.A. with you,
because you're so gorgeous.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.441

I would definitely,
yes, I'm so in.

- Hm.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.595
- Bobby? Um, I--
- What do you think first

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.497
of the-- the spread,
what do you think?

01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:59.066
We, uh, we went all out with,
uh, cheesy tomatoes,

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.769
thin sliced, um, premium ham,

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:05.440
with a ham and--
and tomato as well,
