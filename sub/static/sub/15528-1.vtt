DISASTER WARS:
EARTHQUAKE VS. TSUNAMI

00:50.463 --> 00:53.963
Subrip: Pix

01:17.092 --> 01:19.328
Slowly...

01:24.566 --> 01:27.069
You are doing
a great job, Karen.

01:27.102 --> 01:30.006
Just keep it steady.

01:39.780 --> 01:41.983
Tonya, radio topside

01:42.016 --> 01:44.986
and tell 'em we're nearing
our desired depth.

01:45.019 --> 01:48.790
Sure thing, Dr. Taylor.

01:48.824 --> 01:51.327
Topside, this is
Deep Abyss Explorer.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.796
How's it looking up there? Over.

01:53.828 --> 01:55.998
Explorer, this is topside.

01:56.030 --> 01:57.999
Calm seas up here. Over.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.768
<i>Roger that, topside.</i>

01:59.801 --> 02:01.670
<i>We are approaching the desired
depth in the trench.</i>

02:01.702 --> 02:04.939
Over.

02:04.973 --> 02:07.108
Roger, Explorer.
You are clear to continue. Over.

02:08.943 --> 02:10.779
Roger that.
Continuing with the experiment.

02:10.812 --> 02:13.015
Deep Abyss Explorer out.

02:22.324 --> 02:26.094
Okay, nice and slow.

02:26.128 --> 02:27.830
Watch your depth very carefully.

02:27.862 --> 02:30.131
Don't worry, Dad, okay?

02:32.200 --> 02:34.369
I got it.

02:43.644 --> 02:45.613
What was that?

02:45.647 --> 02:47.850
I don't know! The controls,
they... they aren't responding!

02:50.918 --> 02:54.790
Tonya, radio topside. Tell them
they have to stop us now.

02:54.822 --> 02:57.492
We're dropping too fast.

03:01.529 --> 03:02.964
Mayday. Mayday.

03:02.998 --> 03:04.566
<i>Topside, we are dropping
too fast.</i>

03:04.599 --> 03:07.336
We are closing in
on collapse depth.

03:10.205 --> 03:12.141
Topside!

03:14.108 --> 03:15.878
Roger that, Explorer.

03:15.910 --> 03:17.979
Braking now.

03:20.182 --> 03:22.051
Stan! Stan, are you all right?

03:22.083 --> 03:22.883
I think so...

03:22.918 --> 03:23.684
Wait, wait...

03:23.718 --> 03:24.753
How bad is it?

03:24.785 --> 03:28.089
Follow my finger.

03:32.393 --> 03:35.463
Well, outside of a bump on the
head, I think you'll live.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.035
Are you two okay?

03:40.068 --> 03:41.035
Yeah.

03:41.069 --> 03:43.037
Okay.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.574
Tonya, patch me through
to topside, would you?

03:45.606 --> 03:48.243
Console's a little flaky
right now, but I'll try.

03:50.144 --> 03:54.082
Topside, this is Deep Abyss
Explorer. Do you copy?

03:54.116 --> 03:55.917
Karen, are the...
Are the controls working?

03:55.951 --> 03:58.019
Not at the moment.

03:58.052 --> 04:01.557
Okay, keep trying, okay?

04:01.590 --> 04:03.691
Dr. Greene, can you run
a full diagnostic

04:03.725 --> 04:05.027
of the wave generator, please?

04:05.059 --> 04:06.261
Right away.

04:06.294 --> 04:08.130
Topside, this is
Deep Abyss Explorer.

04:08.162 --> 04:11.732
<i>Do you copy?</i>

04:11.766 --> 04:13.802
Explorer, this is topside.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.043
Topside, this is Dr. Taylor.

04:22.076 --> 04:25.480
Our controls are not responding.

04:25.513 --> 04:27.949
We want you to pull us up
right away. Over.

04:29.484 --> 04:35.257
<i>Topside, can you hear me? Over.</i>

04:35.290 --> 04:38.927
Explorer, this is topside.
Repeat last transmission. Over.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.997
Topside, controls
are not responding.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.566
I repeat they are
not responding.

04:44.598 --> 04:47.502
Request you pull us up now.
Over.

04:47.535 --> 04:51.072
Explorer, was the
wave generator damaged? Over.

04:51.105 --> 04:54.909
Dr. Greene, has the
diagnostics check completed?

04:54.942 --> 04:58.479
All systems are normal.

04:58.513 --> 05:01.650
Topside, we request
aborting the experiment

05:01.682 --> 05:04.086
and be pulled up. Over.

05:04.119 --> 05:05.921
<i>Explorer, negative
on extraction.</i>

05:05.953 --> 05:08.323
<i>What's the status of
the wave generator? Over.</i>

05:08.355 --> 05:13.194
Topside, diagnostics report
all circuits are operating,

05:13.227 --> 05:16.165
but I am very worried
about our position.

05:16.198 --> 05:20.936
<i>And we wish to be
pulled up, now. Over.</i>

05:20.968 --> 05:22.803
Explorer, negative on
extraction.

05:22.836 --> 05:26.307
We will hold your position.
Proceed with the experiment.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.610
<i>Over.</i>

05:29.643 --> 05:31.780
Karen, how are the
controls coming?

05:33.081 --> 05:35.484
I've got nothing.

05:35.516 --> 05:37.351
We're hanging on by a thread.

05:37.384 --> 05:39.187
Literally.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.557
Dad...

05:41.590 --> 05:43.691
What's the plan?

05:47.696 --> 05:50.465
Topside, proceeding
with the experiment.

05:50.497 --> 05:54.135
We'll... we'll get back
to you. Over.

05:54.169 --> 05:57.639
Dr. Taylor, good luck.

05:57.672 --> 06:00.275
Topside out.

06:03.177 --> 06:05.247
Dr. Taylor, this is madness!

06:05.280 --> 06:07.749
The sheer power from the pulse
from the wave generator

06:07.782 --> 06:09.251
could break this hull apart.

06:09.283 --> 06:11.819
Yeah, Dr. T,
I don't like this either.

06:11.852 --> 06:14.855
I mean, there's gotta be
something we can do.

06:14.888 --> 06:17.359
You know, I could just
fake the data.

06:28.569 --> 06:30.872
Karen, is the brake locked?

06:30.905 --> 06:35.042
For now, but... it's all
being controlled by topside.

06:35.076 --> 06:37.546
Well, we're above
collapse depth, so...

06:37.578 --> 06:39.047
Only by a few hundred feet.

06:39.079 --> 06:40.748
Great!

06:40.782 --> 06:43.518
Look, I don't like this any more
than the rest of you.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.286
The fact is, they're not gonna
pull us up

06:45.319 --> 06:46.622
until we're through
with the experiment.

06:46.655 --> 06:48.457
Okay?

06:48.489 --> 06:51.727
It's... it's unfortunate,
but it's the simple truth

06:53.627 --> 06:58.232
Tonya, can you get the operating
systems up and running?

06:58.266 --> 06:59.801
All set.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.571
Dr. Greene?

07:02.603 --> 07:04.973
All set.

07:07.574 --> 07:09.543
Okay...

07:09.576 --> 07:12.747
Well... here goes nothing.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.729
Yes! It's working!

07:27.761 --> 07:30.798
Dr. T, we're getting
a ton of data!

07:30.831 --> 07:33.901
Dr. Taylor, we really did it!

07:45.280 --> 07:47.082
What was that?

07:47.114 --> 07:50.552
Everybody quiet. Just be quiet
and just listen for a second.

07:54.355 --> 07:56.992
Tonya, can you patch me through
to topside?

07:57.025 --> 07:58.961
On it.

08:02.530 --> 08:05.701
Topside, this is
Deep Abyss Explorer.

08:05.734 --> 08:07.803
We need immediate evacuation.

08:07.836 --> 08:10.771
We experiencing
falling debris, over.

08:10.804 --> 08:13.175
Explorer, this is topside.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.775
Was the experiment successful?

08:14.809 --> 08:16.645
What?

08:16.678 --> 08:19.181
Yeah, yes, we have
all the data we need,

08:19.213 --> 08:21.782
now... now...
Now pull us up. Over.

08:21.815 --> 08:24.352
Roger that, Explorer.

08:24.386 --> 08:26.755
Pulling you up.

08:37.998 --> 08:40.034
What was that?

08:40.068 --> 08:42.337
This can't be good.

08:42.370 --> 08:44.172
I'm sure we'll be moving
in a moment.

08:55.784 --> 08:58.086
Dr. Greene, do you know
what's going on?

08:58.118 --> 09:01.989
This is more than a little
shakeup from the wave generator.

09:02.022 --> 09:04.658
Could be a number of things.
I'm not one to speculate.

09:04.692 --> 09:07.396
Maybe right now is a good time
to start, don't you think?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.380
I think we might've triggered
our worst fear, Jeff.

09:25.413 --> 09:27.916
Dad?

09:27.949 --> 09:31.386
What is he talking about?

09:31.419 --> 09:34.289
Mega-thrust earthquake.

09:34.322 --> 09:37.458
That doesn't sound good.

09:44.799 --> 09:48.569
No... neither is the
mega-tsunami that will follow.

10:03.450 --> 10:05.353
Should've brought
the bigger boat.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.570
What is that?
What's going on?

10:22.603 --> 10:25.272
There's gotta be something
we can do, Dr. T, right?

10:25.305 --> 10:27.175
I'm afraid not.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.144
We only have a short amount
of time now.

10:29.176 --> 10:31.479
Until what?

10:31.512 --> 10:35.115
Implosion.

10:35.149 --> 10:36.684
And finishing what we started.

10:36.718 --> 10:40.956
Our arrogance will
kill millions!

12:09.710 --> 12:11.979
Take a look at this.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.756
This can't be right.

12:22.790 --> 12:25.593
Luke, check the remote
connection

12:25.626 --> 12:28.630
to the Pacific seismometers.

12:28.663 --> 12:32.534
It looks like two at the
Marianas Trench are kaput,

12:32.567 --> 12:36.304
but it looks like the rest of
them are operational.

12:36.337 --> 12:38.773
The recent ratings
are off the chart.

12:38.805 --> 12:42.944
It's gotta be a glitch.
Nothing can be that big.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.078
Right?

12:44.112 --> 12:46.415
Let me... let me check.
Hold on.

12:51.817 --> 12:51.817
No.

12:51.852 --> 12:53.954
What is it?

12:53.987 --> 12:56.256
It looks like one of the
seismometers is down.

12:56.290 --> 12:59.794
There were four of 'em, and now
only three are operational.

12:59.827 --> 13:04.599
Are all three in the
Western Pacific?

13:04.631 --> 13:06.400
Yes.

13:06.434 --> 13:09.637
Then... then it's
headed this way.

13:18.311 --> 13:20.147
What are we gonna do?

13:20.180 --> 13:22.117
Get the thing! Get the
headpiece! Get the headpiece!

13:22.150 --> 13:23.751
We have to warn everyone!

13:23.785 --> 13:25.453
Put it on your head!
Call 'em!

13:25.486 --> 13:27.389
Get it!

13:31.059 --> 13:34.029
This is an emergency broadcast

13:34.061 --> 13:37.097
from the Pacific Tsunami
Warning Center.

13:38.833 --> 13:41.602
A massive earthquake
has been detected,

13:41.636 --> 13:43.838
originating from
the Marianas Trench,

13:43.871 --> 13:48.143
resulting in a mega-tsunami.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.310
Luke. Luke!

13:50.343 --> 13:51.780
Yeah, yeah?

13:51.813 --> 13:53.982
Send out the warning
to the other centres.

13:54.015 --> 13:55.317
All right, all right.

13:59.520 --> 14:03.024
The tsunami will hit the islands
very shortly.

14:03.056 --> 14:06.860
Seek high ground and shelter
immediately.

14:06.894 --> 14:10.632
There is no time for evacuation.

14:10.665 --> 14:12.900
May god have mercy on us all.

14:12.934 --> 14:15.670
Luke! What are you doing?

14:15.703 --> 14:17.304
I have to be with her.

14:17.338 --> 14:20.040
Wait! There isn't time!

14:20.074 --> 14:22.077
I have to!

14:22.109 --> 14:24.878
<i>No one is available
to take your call.</i>

14:24.911 --> 14:26.381
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

14:29.717 --> 14:31.553
Honey, I don't know why

14:31.585 --> 14:33.454
you're not answering the phone
right now, but listen...

14:36.357 --> 14:38.593
my way home.
Don't leave the house,

14:38.626 --> 14:40.395
don't listen to anything
you hear on the TV.

14:40.428 --> 14:42.063
Just stay where you are.

14:42.096 --> 14:43.698
I'm gonna be right home,
just please stay where you are.

14:43.731 --> 14:45.934
I'll be right home.

15:19.934 --> 15:22.069
Aahh...

16:24.064 --> 16:26.798
It can't be!

16:26.833 --> 16:28.502
No, no, no. That's not right.

17:10.077 --> 17:11.511
Dr. Stoker?

17:11.544 --> 17:14.047
Yeah, Daniel, Daniel,

17:14.079 --> 17:16.251
<i>can you get down to the lab
immediately?</i>

17:16.282 --> 17:17.917
<i>We've got a lot of data
to sort out,</i>

17:17.952 --> 17:19.887
and very little time to do it.

17:19.921 --> 17:23.491
Well, what are you
talking about, Doc?

17:23.522 --> 17:27.728
The mega-tsunami.

17:27.761 --> 17:31.366
It's only theoretical.
It's not possible.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.167
Yeah, well, well...
Well, it's happening.

17:34.201 --> 17:36.671
<i>Look, look...</i>

17:36.703 --> 17:38.106
Just get down to the lab.

17:38.138 --> 17:40.074
<i>I'll explain it
when we get there.</i>

17:47.548 --> 17:49.217
Get up.

17:53.154 --> 17:54.923
What time is it?

17:54.955 --> 17:58.025
Get up. Put those on.

17:58.059 --> 17:59.594
What's going on?

17:59.626 --> 18:03.298
I have to go to the lab.

18:03.330 --> 18:06.233
And you need to get out of here.
Someplace far away.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.569
You're kidding, right?

18:08.601 --> 18:13.040
Hey, you have to
get out of here.

18:13.073 --> 18:17.644
Just go... just stay with
my mom for a while.

18:17.677 --> 18:18.646
Are you serious?

18:18.678 --> 18:21.815
Please. This is important.

18:36.129 --> 18:40.068
Your mom lives in Arkansas.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.270
It's like 15,000 miles away.

18:42.302 --> 18:43.637
1500.

18:43.671 --> 18:45.607
Hope that it's far enough.

19:59.713 --> 20:01.883
Dear god.

20:06.419 --> 20:10.257
Sweetheart, Sylvia.
Sweetheart.

20:10.290 --> 20:11.591
What's going on?
I wanna stay in bed.

20:11.625 --> 20:14.328
I know, but I need you
to get up, okay?

20:14.360 --> 20:16.130
Just come on, get dressed.

20:41.489 --> 20:43.425
Let's go.

21:17.290 --> 21:20.094
I'm coming! I'm coming.

21:20.126 --> 21:22.030
Hold your horses.

21:25.832 --> 21:27.768
I'm coming, I said.

21:40.713 --> 21:42.316
Can I help you?

21:42.348 --> 21:43.783
Dr. Vickers, I'm gunnery
sergeant Benjamin Wright.

21:43.817 --> 21:47.688
You need to come with me.

21:47.721 --> 21:49.490
Why? What happened?

21:49.522 --> 21:51.291
I'm not at liberty
to say, sir.

21:51.325 --> 21:52.994
My orders are to take you to the
Thundercloud Bunker immediately.

21:53.027 --> 21:53.995
Thundercloud?

21:54.028 --> 21:55.997
The country needs you.

21:56.030 --> 21:59.000
I don't understand.
What do you want with me?

21:59.032 --> 22:02.669
Please step out
of the house, sir.

22:02.703 --> 22:07.208
I have my orders. You'll be
removed by force if necessary.

22:07.241 --> 22:09.176
That's not necessary.
Just give me a minute.

22:09.210 --> 22:12.713
You can take care of that later.

22:12.745 --> 22:14.447
Okay. Let me just
grab my papers.

22:14.481 --> 22:16.617
No need, sir.
We have everything.

22:16.649 --> 22:18.852
Let's go, Doc.

22:29.096 --> 22:31.031
Let's go, Doc.

23:22.482 --> 23:24.217
Listen to yourself. You're just
going on and on and on

23:24.251 --> 23:26.087
for the last 10 minutes,
20 minutes.

23:26.119 --> 23:28.455
But we're the ones
who caused it. If we hadn't...

23:28.489 --> 23:31.559
<i>You are not listening to me.
We just flew over.</i>

23:31.591 --> 23:35.195
There's nothing left.

23:35.229 --> 23:37.098
It's what we've been
waiting for:

23:37.130 --> 23:38.732
a true test of our abilities.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.067
Yes, I understand.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.235
An earthquake
caused the tsunami.

23:42.269 --> 23:44.739
<i>Understood?</i>

23:51.011 --> 23:54.048
Is this thing working?

23:54.080 --> 23:55.248
Are you hearing me?

23:55.281 --> 23:56.449
Yes.

23:56.482 --> 23:57.617
Good.

23:57.651 --> 24:00.554
<i>Get a press release printed.</i>

24:00.587 --> 24:03.257
<i>I want this submitted
to all of the affiliates.</i>

24:03.290 --> 24:04.258
You hear me?

24:04.290 --> 24:05.992
Yes, yes, I got it.

24:06.026 --> 24:07.428
All of them.

24:07.461 --> 24:09.463
Okay, all of them.

24:09.495 --> 24:10.964
<i>You have about 20 minutes.</i>

24:10.998 --> 24:12.934
Okay. All right.

24:50.503 --> 24:52.706
Afternoon, gentlemen.
IDs please.

24:57.845 --> 24:59.847
Gunnery Sergeant Wright,
who do you have with you?

24:59.879 --> 25:01.448
Dr. Ivan Vickers.

25:01.482 --> 25:05.118
Dr. Ivan Vickers?

25:05.152 --> 25:07.055
Wait here, please.

25:14.427 --> 25:17.531
Sergeant Wright, Dr. Vickers,
please follow me.

25:37.885 --> 25:40.355
Going down?

25:47.427 --> 25:49.530
Not very talkative,
are you?

26:05.712 --> 26:08.616
How far down are we going?

26:08.648 --> 26:10.550
It's classified, Dr. Vickers.

26:12.618 --> 26:15.222
Really?

26:15.254 --> 26:17.590
That's strange.

26:17.624 --> 26:19.460
What harm could it be?

26:19.492 --> 26:22.163
Let's just say
we're going far enough.

26:29.936 --> 26:33.573
I see.

26:33.607 --> 26:35.776
You need someone to help
with the structure.

26:35.809 --> 26:39.480
That's why you need
a geologist, right?

26:39.512 --> 26:42.382
I really can't say, Dr. Vickers.

26:42.415 --> 26:44.251
Of course.

26:44.283 --> 26:46.619
Well, when do you think I could
get some different clothes?

26:46.653 --> 26:48.689
I really don't want to be
walking around like this.

27:34.867 --> 27:38.205
That feels good.
Right there, yeah.

27:44.344 --> 27:47.948
All right,.

27:47.981 --> 27:49.550
What are you doing?

27:49.582 --> 27:51.317
I'm buttoning your shirt up.
We're late.

27:51.350 --> 27:53.186
There are reporters upstairs
waiting for us, right now.

27:55.556 --> 27:58.225
No. No.

27:58.258 --> 27:59.994
No, you're going. Come on.

28:00.027 --> 28:03.697
Finish getting dressed.
Zip your pants up. Let's go.

28:03.730 --> 28:05.031
Now!

28:05.065 --> 28:07.001
Zip my pants up.

28:14.174 --> 28:16.077
Let's do this.

28:17.511 --> 28:19.980
Come on!

28:20.012 --> 28:21.781
We're running a bit behind.

28:24.283 --> 28:26.219
Come on, sit in front
of the boat.

28:47.808 --> 28:50.444
Dr. Vickers, please join us.

28:50.476 --> 28:53.947
Dr. Vickers, nice to meet you,

28:53.981 --> 28:56.617
although I wish it was under
better circumstances.

28:56.649 --> 28:58.851
Nice to meet you.

28:58.885 --> 29:00.788
Please, sit down.

29:06.326 --> 29:10.931
So, what are the
circumstances, exactly?

29:10.963 --> 29:13.501
Colonel.

29:21.907 --> 29:24.444
What am I looking at?

29:27.114 --> 29:30.718
Right.

29:30.751 --> 29:32.453
Approximately 12 hours ago,

29:32.485 --> 29:36.255
an earthquake suddenly occurred
here, along the Marianas Trench.

29:36.289 --> 29:38.892
Our reports indicate that this
was a massive shift

29:38.925 --> 29:41.995
of the Pacific and
Marianas plates.

29:42.029 --> 29:44.897
What were the seismic readings
before the earthquake?

29:46.966 --> 29:49.902
All reports were normal,
up to the point of the quake.

29:49.935 --> 29:53.072
No tremors at all?

29:53.106 --> 29:54.775
What about from the
Pacific Warning Center?

29:54.808 --> 29:55.943
They were...

29:55.975 --> 29:57.810
That's not important, Doctor.

29:57.844 --> 30:02.249
Dr. Vickers, the earthquake is
not our major concern right now.

30:02.281 --> 30:05.685
Right now, we have much more
pressing issues to consider.

30:11.491 --> 30:12.442
The tsunami.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.394
Correct.

30:17.864 --> 30:20.167
Where is it now?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.336
The tsunami's on a collision
course with the Western Coast.

30:22.368 --> 30:25.138
It looks to hit Southern
California up to Los Angeles.

30:25.172 --> 30:27.473
We need you input on
a possible solution.

30:27.507 --> 30:30.110
Solution to what?

30:30.143 --> 30:34.548
My field is geology.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.183
Stopping it.

30:36.215 --> 30:38.516
-You want to stop a tsunami?
-Yes.

30:38.551 --> 30:40.953
Impossible.

30:40.986 --> 30:43.856
It is one of the most
destructive natural forces

30:43.889 --> 30:45.693
known to man.

30:45.725 --> 30:49.862
Its only purpose is to destroy.
You cannot stop a tsunami.

30:49.896 --> 30:52.732
It's a juggernaut...
of death.

31:05.345 --> 31:06.814
Toni, turn on the news.

31:06.847 --> 31:08.348
The press conference
is about to start.

31:19.392 --> 31:21.261
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

31:21.293 --> 31:23.930
<i>Let's go ahead and
get started, shall we?</i>

31:23.963 --> 31:27.000
<i>Finally, the ability to control</i>

31:27.032 --> 31:30.536
Mother Nature's most destructive
forces is at man's disposal.

31:30.569 --> 31:32.271
Through my company,

31:32.305 --> 31:34.642
<i>we can stop the tsunami.</i>

31:36.542 --> 31:38.846
<i>And because of my generosity,</i>

31:38.878 --> 31:43.216
<i>I will make my satellites
available to the United States.</i>

31:43.250 --> 31:47.253
<i>Together, we will save
millions of lives.</i>

31:47.287 --> 31:49.289
And has the United States
contacted you yet

31:49.321 --> 31:50.924
requesting your help.

31:50.956 --> 31:54.927
No, not yet. But I expect
a call at any moment.

31:54.961 --> 31:57.530
So please do excuse me
if I need to rush off.

31:57.563 --> 32:01.234
Mr. Nariño, how exactly is the
satellite supposed to work?

32:04.570 --> 32:09.876
A concentrated wave of energy is
directed at the Earth's crust,

32:09.909 --> 32:12.278
'cause it to fracture.

32:12.311 --> 32:17.550
It'll be a much larger scale, of
course, covering a broad area.

32:17.584 --> 32:19.820
And what is the energy wave
composed of?

32:19.853 --> 32:23.757
<i>The actual frequency and pulse
of the wave</i>

32:23.790 --> 32:25.992
is a closely guarded secret,

32:26.026 --> 32:28.495
something we cannot share.

32:28.528 --> 32:32.165
We would hate for it to fall
into the wrong hands, no?

32:32.198 --> 32:33.733
Has this process been tested?

32:33.767 --> 32:36.170
I mean, have you successfully
created a wave

32:36.203 --> 32:37.637
in the ocean before?

32:37.671 --> 32:39.807
<i>Not in the ocean,</i>

32:39.839 --> 32:42.842
<i>but smaller scale lab tests
have been conducted,</i>

32:42.876 --> 32:46.747
<i>and the results have been
very favourable.</i>

32:46.780 --> 32:49.683
<i>And I have been informed that
the satellite</i>

32:49.715 --> 32:53.020
<i>will perform equally as well on
the scale we need.</i>

32:53.052 --> 32:55.789
So the satellite has not
been properly tested.

32:55.821 --> 32:58.090
No, no, no.
That is not what I'm saying.

32:58.124 --> 33:00.861
The satellite is being
repurposed

33:00.894 --> 33:03.262
to perform a necessary action.

33:03.296 --> 33:05.632
<i>This is well within
our capabilities.</i>

33:05.665 --> 33:08.801
Firing a wave of energy
at the tsunami

33:08.835 --> 33:11.505
is within your capabilities?

33:11.538 --> 33:13.373
Directly in it's path, actually.

33:13.405 --> 33:16.475
That sounds like a
military operation.

33:16.509 --> 33:19.046
<i>But if successful, won't that
just add to the problem</i>

33:19.078 --> 33:21.447
and create another tsunami?

33:21.481 --> 33:24.151
<i>It will create another wave.</i>

33:24.184 --> 33:25.819
<i>But it will be travelling</i>

33:25.851 --> 33:28.021
<i>in opposition to
the original tsunami.</i>

33:28.053 --> 33:31.691
When the two waves collide,

33:31.724 --> 33:33.694
they will just cancel out
one another.

33:33.726 --> 33:36.463
Now, I want to make one thing
perfectly clear.

33:36.495 --> 33:41.001
Nothing of this scale has ever
been attempted by any man.

33:41.033 --> 33:43.903
Today, we will make history.

33:43.936 --> 33:47.707
<i>And I stake
my reputation on it.</i>

33:51.411 --> 33:52.580
And... cut!

33:55.080 --> 33:58.551
Good job. You over here.
You over here.

34:05.425 --> 34:06.392
All right?

34:06.426 --> 34:09.597
Five, four, three, two...

34:16.803 --> 34:18.438
Ladies and gentlemen,
there you have it.

34:18.469 --> 34:20.438
Straight from billionaire
Simon Nariño

34:20.472 --> 34:22.241
of Thunderstorm Technologies.

34:22.274 --> 34:24.710
The fate of the entire
West Coast

34:24.743 --> 34:28.380
may rest upon his
cutting edge technology.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.050
May god look down
upon him today.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.786
I'm Jason Andrews,

34:32.818 --> 34:35.788
reporting to you live from
Channel 4 Metro News.

34:35.821 --> 34:37.757
Please stay tuned
for further updates

34:37.790 --> 34:39.260
as more information filters in.

35:10.323 --> 35:13.225
Who told him this was possible?

35:13.258 --> 35:15.461
He's just playing god
with people's lives.

35:15.495 --> 35:19.066
What's that, Daniel?

35:19.098 --> 35:21.100
The press conference.

35:21.133 --> 35:22.435
What do you think about it?

35:22.468 --> 35:23.936
I wasn't listening.

35:23.970 --> 35:26.772
There's something here.

35:26.805 --> 35:31.345
This rich guy, Simon Nariño,
he's on every channel

35:31.377 --> 35:33.180
telling people
about the tsunami,

35:33.213 --> 35:35.247
and well, Hawaii.

35:35.281 --> 35:38.952
So now everybody knows.

35:38.984 --> 35:41.120
Couldn't have been
timed any worse.

35:43.055 --> 35:44.957
Mr. Nariño claims
he has a solution.

35:44.990 --> 35:47.960
He said one of his satellites
can create an opposing tsunami

35:47.993 --> 35:51.263
that will roll this one
on top of itself.

35:51.296 --> 35:53.265
A smaller wave, maybe,

35:53.298 --> 35:56.035
but this one seems far too
powerful for that.

35:56.068 --> 36:01.340
He's gonna make things worse.
I can feel it.

36:01.374 --> 36:06.480
Well, let's work it out,
find out.

36:06.513 --> 36:09.816
The only way to know for sure
is to run the numbers.

36:09.848 --> 36:13.319
Trust those, not your gut.

36:13.352 --> 36:16.490
All right, where's the
stress point?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.825
Here is where Mr. Nariño

36:18.857 --> 36:22.396
is planning to focus the energy
wave from one of his satellites,

36:22.428 --> 36:25.564
directly in the path of the
approaching tsunami.

36:25.597 --> 36:28.434
I see. Can you pull up
the underlying structure?

36:33.606 --> 36:36.475
I think you're right.

36:36.508 --> 36:39.311
It has no chance of success
at that point.

36:39.345 --> 36:42.848
Let's try a few more
possibilities.

36:42.881 --> 36:47.521
How about... here...
and here.

36:47.553 --> 36:51.390
I think those should give us
good possible scenarios.

36:51.423 --> 36:53.092
What about here?

36:53.126 --> 36:55.394
I think we may be running out
of time for that one,

36:55.428 --> 36:58.932
but I'll include it anyway.

36:58.964 --> 37:01.068
If a counter tsunami's
gonna work,

37:01.100 --> 37:03.136
it's gonna be from
one of those points.

37:07.207 --> 37:11.545
Now all we have to do is sit
back and wait for the results.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.913
In the meantime, I'm gonna work
with another idea that I've got.

37:40.506 --> 37:43.042
Dr. Vickers, are you familiar
with Mr. Nariño

37:43.075 --> 37:45.478
and his Thunderstorm
Technologies?

37:45.511 --> 37:48.615
Yes, I've worked with
Mr. Nariño and the military

37:48.647 --> 37:51.617
on several projects together.

37:51.651 --> 37:55.888
Then you are familiar with the
wave machine of Mr. Nariño.

37:55.921 --> 37:58.425
No.

37:58.457 --> 38:00.593
But the theory is sound.

38:03.162 --> 38:05.464
We've run a number
of simulations

38:05.497 --> 38:07.934
based on the information
provided by Mr. Nariño

38:07.966 --> 38:10.636
and everything seems
to check out,

38:10.669 --> 38:12.171
but I'm not sure

38:12.205 --> 38:14.007
if I should be looking for
something in particular.

38:14.039 --> 38:15.841
Maybe you could
check through these

38:15.874 --> 38:18.444
and see if you spot anything.

38:20.513 --> 38:26.486
Definitely the direction
that I would've taken.

38:29.189 --> 38:30.991
The exact spot as well.

38:31.024 --> 38:35.295
I think Mr. Nariño has
everything figured out.

38:35.327 --> 38:39.131
So you would recommend
that we go with his plan?

38:39.164 --> 38:41.367
I would, yeah.

38:41.401 --> 38:44.971
No reservations, whatsoever.

38:45.004 --> 38:47.241
No... No, I think
everything is good.

38:52.245 --> 38:55.649
Colonel? Do you agree?

38:55.682 --> 38:58.017
Yes, Madam Vice President,

38:58.051 --> 39:01.221
seeing as we don't really
have any other choice.

39:01.254 --> 39:06.159
Millions of people are counting
on us and the clock is ticking.

39:06.191 --> 39:08.561
Yes, well...

39:08.595 --> 39:10.897
Madam Vice President,
may I also recommend

39:10.930 --> 39:13.567
that we begin evacuations
as a proactive measure?

39:13.600 --> 39:15.402
Not that we won't succeed,
ma'am.

39:15.435 --> 39:19.339
Yes, of course. I'll call FEMA
and get the ball rolling.

39:19.372 --> 39:22.175
You'll have to all excuse me.

39:22.207 --> 39:24.176
I have a very important
call to make.

39:24.209 --> 39:29.081
Madam Vice President.

39:29.115 --> 39:30.883
Well...

39:30.917 --> 39:32.853
Now we wait.

40:29.575 --> 40:31.511
Go, go, go, go, go.

41:04.776 --> 41:06.111
What's up?

41:06.144 --> 41:08.247
What's up?

41:08.281 --> 41:10.817
Hey, looks like you're having
some car troubles there.

41:10.850 --> 41:14.321
No, I actually
got it covered.

41:14.354 --> 41:16.689
You think so.

41:16.722 --> 41:19.291
Maybe I can give you a ride,
you know? Give you a hand.

41:19.325 --> 41:20.859
No, no.

41:20.892 --> 41:22.595
You sure? You know,
maybe I could help you out.

41:22.627 --> 41:24.129
You know, I'm good with my
hands. You know what I mean?

41:24.162 --> 41:26.198
No, no. Thanks.
I got it covered.

41:26.231 --> 41:28.267
Well, you know, looks like
you're heading out of town.

41:28.301 --> 41:30.804
Maybe you could
give me a lift.

41:30.836 --> 41:33.972
Actually, I'm gonna be picking a
lot of people up, so I can't...

41:34.006 --> 41:34.973
I really gotta get going.

41:35.006 --> 41:36.675
Hold on.

41:36.709 --> 41:38.511
I think you and I
could be friends.

41:38.544 --> 41:41.013
So why don't you just make
some room in the back.

41:41.046 --> 41:42.848
I know you got room in there.

41:42.881 --> 41:44.783
Okay... You need to
just let me go.

41:44.816 --> 41:46.819
I'm not looking for
any trouble here, okay?

41:46.852 --> 41:48.354
And I'm kind of in a hurry.

41:48.388 --> 41:50.323
Relax, all right, babe?

41:50.356 --> 41:51.991
You know, the world
is about to end, okay,

41:52.024 --> 41:53.359
so you don't got nowhere to be.

41:53.392 --> 41:54.626
So why don't you and I get in
the back

41:54.660 --> 41:56.863
and we go for a little ride?

42:02.234 --> 42:04.671
Yes! Yes!

42:16.115 --> 42:19.752
Sir, you wanted to see me?

42:19.785 --> 42:22.088
We need to talk about
our little experiment.

42:24.524 --> 42:25.892
Okay.

42:25.925 --> 42:28.428
What we have here

42:28.461 --> 42:31.231
is an opportunity of a lifetime.

42:33.231 --> 42:37.570
It's a chance to win the hearts
and minds of the world.

42:40.472 --> 42:42.942
As well as show them
the power we wield.

42:46.312 --> 42:48.848
But what about the incident that
started all of this?

42:48.881 --> 42:53.086
Well, that depends on you.

42:53.118 --> 42:57.189
I see no reason why it even
needs to be discussed.

42:57.222 --> 43:02.094
Maybe because we caused the
tsunami that killed many people?

43:05.964 --> 43:08.968
I caused nothing.

43:09.001 --> 43:12.571
I was nowhere near
that submarine.

43:12.604 --> 43:16.642
I had no idea you
were there either.

43:16.676 --> 43:19.078
Well, no, I wasn't there,
personally,

43:19.111 --> 43:20.814
but we both know it happened.

43:20.847 --> 43:22.881
There you have it.

43:22.914 --> 43:25.818
None of us was on that
submarine.

43:25.852 --> 43:28.721
None of us really
knows what happened.

43:28.754 --> 43:31.424
And the one who do know...

43:31.457 --> 43:33.359
well, they're gone.

43:35.461 --> 43:37.997
Understood?

43:38.030 --> 43:38.997
Yes.

43:39.031 --> 43:42.101
That settles that.

43:42.133 --> 43:45.304
Now we need to concentrate
on the next step,

43:45.338 --> 43:48.175
which is to stop
what has been created.

43:51.611 --> 43:54.681
I expect a call from
Dr. Vickers very soon.

44:25.977 --> 44:28.615
It's not much,
but it's something.

44:28.647 --> 44:33.553
Thank you, Daniel.

44:33.586 --> 44:34.620
Did you see anyone else
on campus?

44:34.653 --> 44:36.522
Nope.

44:36.555 --> 44:40.792
I'm pretty sure we're the only
ones dumb enough to be here.

44:40.825 --> 44:43.963
About that. I'm sorry.

44:43.995 --> 44:46.465
But I really do appreciate
having you here.

44:46.499 --> 44:48.801
Hey... not a problem.

44:48.834 --> 44:52.071
It's what we do, right?

44:52.104 --> 44:54.807
Besides, it's not like I had
anywhere I needed to be today.

44:54.839 --> 44:58.010
What about Allison?
Where's she?

44:59.778 --> 45:01.547
I sent her to my mom's
as soon as you called.

45:03.783 --> 45:06.219
She should be well
on her way now.

45:06.252 --> 45:08.688
Good. I'm glad she's safe.

45:22.801 --> 45:24.738
This is worse than I thought.

45:32.544 --> 45:34.613
Here are the data points we ran,

45:34.647 --> 45:36.683
representing the
possible locations

45:36.716 --> 45:38.919
for a counter tsunami
to be created.

45:40.986 --> 45:43.589
And...

45:43.622 --> 45:46.358
according to the data...

45:46.392 --> 45:50.263
this one won't do what we want.

45:50.296 --> 45:52.232
Neither will this one.

45:56.167 --> 45:57.135
Or these.

45:57.169 --> 45:58.705
That's unfortunate.

45:58.738 --> 46:01.707
None of these will do any good?

46:01.740 --> 46:03.909
Nope.

46:03.943 --> 46:07.613
No matter which point we choose,
the outcome will be the same.

46:07.647 --> 46:09.382
Which is?

46:09.414 --> 46:13.185
The tsunami will be even bigger
and stronger than it is now.

46:14.953 --> 46:16.155
Just as we feared.

46:16.187 --> 46:18.624
If this data is accurate,

46:18.658 --> 46:21.894
parts of the tsunami
will reach Nevada.

46:21.926 --> 46:24.162
We have to stop them.

46:24.196 --> 46:27.066
This is the federal government
you're talking about, Daniel.

46:27.098 --> 46:29.769
You can't just call them up and
tell them what to do.

46:29.801 --> 46:32.939
Maybe we can.

46:40.143 --> 46:40.143
Gentlemen.

46:40.178 --> 46:42.014
Madam
Vice President.

46:42.048 --> 46:43.984
Ms. Sims.

46:48.354 --> 46:53.192
The president has
considered all options,

46:53.225 --> 46:57.430
including our recommendations,

46:57.463 --> 47:01.133
and he has decided to go with
Mr. Nariño's plan.

47:01.167 --> 47:03.336
We have a lot of work to do and
not much time to do it in.

47:03.368 --> 47:08.106
So this being a military
operation...

47:08.140 --> 47:10.143
I'm handing it over
to Colonel Brayman.

47:10.176 --> 47:13.580
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

47:15.680 --> 47:19.718
Now, Dr. Vickers,
I'll expect you to work closely

47:19.752 --> 47:23.289
with Ms. Sims
during this project.

47:23.321 --> 47:26.492
Absolutely, Colonel.
I'll do anything I can to help.

47:26.524 --> 47:27.993
Thank you.

47:28.026 --> 47:29.194
Colonel.

47:29.227 --> 47:31.164
Thank you.

47:38.537 --> 47:40.473
Ms. Sims, I need you to
coordinate this

47:40.506 --> 47:44.310
with the computer and
satellite uplink.

47:44.343 --> 47:47.180
Right away,
Colonel Brayman, sir.

47:51.417 --> 47:55.421
It's okay.
Do your job, all right?

47:55.453 --> 47:58.524
You're more than up to doing it.
Okay, kid?

47:58.557 --> 48:02.395
Yes, sir.

48:02.428 --> 48:06.866
Dr. Vickers, this is
your field of expertise.

48:06.899 --> 48:09.102
Now, we are expecting you
to get us through this.

48:09.135 --> 48:11.705
You know what's at stake.

48:14.140 --> 48:18.745
Inputting the coordinates
to the satellite uplink now.

48:20.546 --> 48:22.448
Double-checking them.

48:24.582 --> 48:28.354
How does everything look, Doc?

48:28.386 --> 48:33.626
There are no changes in the
recent satellite scans.

48:33.658 --> 48:35.127
Everything looks good to me.

48:40.665 --> 48:43.602
You know,
we only have one shot at this.

48:43.635 --> 48:45.571
Right.

48:51.310 --> 48:53.646
Gunny, I have a call
for Colonel Brayman, sir.

48:53.678 --> 48:55.447
Hang on a second, Corporal.

48:55.481 --> 48:59.385
Just waiting on the doc's
confirmation of the target.

48:59.417 --> 49:00.886
What is the primary confirmation
of the target zone?

49:00.919 --> 49:02.488
Are we on target?

49:02.521 --> 49:05.290
I recommend we proceed
immediately.

49:05.323 --> 49:06.626
Colonel?

49:06.658 --> 49:10.796
Madam Vice President, it's time.

49:10.830 --> 49:12.598
Carry on, Colonel.

49:12.631 --> 49:16.669
Colonel, I believe the caller
said it was important, sir.

49:16.702 --> 49:18.069
Who is it, Corporal?

49:18.102 --> 49:20.472
He said his name
was Dr. Stoker, sir.

49:20.506 --> 49:22.105
-Dr. Mitchell Stoker?
-Yes, sir.

49:22.140 --> 49:23.742
You know him, Gunny?

49:23.776 --> 49:26.513
Yes, sir. Dr. Stoker was
Dr. Vickers' predecessor.

49:28.446 --> 49:29.682
Could be a second opinion, sir.

49:33.986 --> 49:38.324
All right, patch it through.

49:38.356 --> 49:41.092
<i>Yeah, hi, are you in charge?</i>

49:41.126 --> 49:44.129
<i>Gunny, hi.
Good to see you.</i>

49:44.162 --> 49:45.865
<i>You know, listen I...</i>

49:45.897 --> 49:49.635
Dr. Stoker,
I am Colonel Brayman.

49:49.667 --> 49:52.338
I'm in charge here. I'm afraid
we don't have much time.

49:52.370 --> 49:55.807
<i>Exactly! So please listen.</i>

49:55.841 --> 49:59.345
<i>Nariño's plan to stop the
tsunami won't work!</i>

49:59.377 --> 50:00.979
<i>You must not go along with it.</i>

50:01.013 --> 50:05.484
Colonel, he has no idea
what he's talking about.

50:05.517 --> 50:07.854
<i>No, no! I've run a simulation.</i>

50:07.886 --> 50:09.522
You're insane, old man!

50:09.555 --> 50:12.792
The numbers don't lie.
You were fired for a reason,

50:12.825 --> 50:14.861
and I replaced you.

50:14.894 --> 50:17.696
Your ideas are outdated.

50:17.729 --> 50:19.731
<i>No, the wave generator cannot...</i>

50:19.765 --> 50:21.734
Dr. Stoker...

50:21.767 --> 50:24.569
<i>Please, Mr. Nariño's machine</i>

50:24.602 --> 50:28.307
<i>will only make
the tsunami stronger!</i>

50:28.339 --> 50:30.376
<i>More people will die.</i>

50:30.408 --> 50:32.044
<i>Colonel, Colonel,
you have to believe us!</i>

50:32.077 --> 50:34.013
<i>We have the data right here!</i>

50:34.046 --> 50:35.414
He has no idea what
he's talking about.

50:35.446 --> 50:37.415
We should proceed.

50:37.448 --> 50:38.917
<i>We do have an alternative.</i>

50:38.950 --> 50:41.186
What... what is it?

50:41.220 --> 50:43.022
<i>Well, I'm still working on it,
but we do have...</i>

50:43.055 --> 50:46.658
I'm sorry, we really must
carry on. Thank you very much.

50:46.691 --> 50:48.327
<i>But Colonel!</i>

50:48.359 --> 50:53.665
Colonel, he doesn't understand
the new technology.

50:53.698 --> 50:56.668
I do.

50:56.702 --> 50:58.571
Are the final coordinates ready?

50:58.604 --> 51:00.872
The satellite is
in position, sir,

51:00.906 --> 51:03.042
and powering up to fire.

51:03.075 --> 51:05.912
Okay, are you framing it right,

51:05.944 --> 51:07.747
'cause we only got
one shot of this.

51:07.780 --> 51:09.281
Yeah, I got it.

51:09.314 --> 51:11.251
It's... awe inspiring.

51:17.756 --> 51:20.526
Firing.

51:20.559 --> 51:22.227
In five...

51:22.260 --> 51:24.562
four...

51:24.595 --> 51:26.298
three...

51:26.332 --> 51:28.901
two...

51:28.934 --> 51:30.068
Come on!

51:30.103 --> 51:31.202
One.

51:31.236 --> 51:32.271
Please, work.

51:32.303 --> 51:34.240
Fire.

51:50.189 --> 51:53.993
That was louder than I thought.

51:54.026 --> 51:57.163
It's working!

52:11.843 --> 52:14.213
It's coming... it's coming back!

52:18.316 --> 52:22.187
Get us out of here!

52:22.220 --> 52:25.457
There's no time.

52:28.160 --> 52:29.729
It's time for us
to pay for our sins.

52:51.350 --> 52:52.718
No, no, no, no, no!

52:52.751 --> 52:56.388
Why didn't that work?

52:56.421 --> 52:58.992
Dr. Vickers?

53:01.160 --> 53:04.163
Do you have a theory
on what just happened there?

53:05.897 --> 53:11.169
No...

53:11.202 --> 53:14.506
I have no explanation.

53:14.539 --> 53:16.508
Colonel, we have a...

53:16.542 --> 53:19.178
We have a...

53:19.211 --> 53:21.213
The tsunami, it...

53:21.245 --> 53:25.151
Just... spit it out.

53:25.184 --> 53:29.187
Besides getting larger and
gaining speed,

53:29.220 --> 53:32.257
the tsunami is also
changing course, sir.

53:32.290 --> 53:35.361
Where's it gonna hit?

53:35.394 --> 53:37.863
It's gonna hit Los Angeles,
full force, sir.

53:37.896 --> 53:41.700
And... there's more.

53:44.702 --> 53:47.872
The aftershocks
from the blast...

53:47.906 --> 53:50.609
they're gonna be a lot stronger
than we expected.

53:50.642 --> 53:52.578
Excuse me, I'm getting a call.

53:56.714 --> 53:59.618
Patch me in with...
Dr. Stoker.

54:28.647 --> 54:31.283
<i>We have breaking news.
A flood warning is in effect</i>

54:31.316 --> 54:34.620
<i>from 6:00 p.m. tonight until
7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</i>

54:34.653 --> 54:38.624
<i>County officials are serving
evacuation notices</i>

54:38.656 --> 54:41.426
<i>to residents that
live close to major levies.</i>

54:41.459 --> 54:42.827
<i>Flood waters are predicted
to rise</i>

54:42.861 --> 54:45.097
<i>up to four feet above normal.</i>

54:45.129 --> 54:47.098
<i>In emergency situations,</i>

54:47.131 --> 54:51.002
<i>residents are advised to move
to higher ground and seek help.</i>

54:51.035 --> 54:53.271
<i>Let's go to weatherman Kevin
who's tracking this flood.</i>

54:53.305 --> 54:55.808
Mommy, I'm hungry!

54:55.841 --> 54:56.976
What'd you say, honey?

54:57.008 --> 55:00.111
Are we almost there?
I'm hungry.

55:00.144 --> 55:03.081
Yeah. We're...
We're almost...

55:03.115 --> 55:04.450
We're almost there.

55:04.482 --> 55:06.118
Okay, in just a little bit.

55:51.729 --> 55:52.865
My...

55:52.897 --> 55:54.867
What's wrong, Mommy?

55:54.899 --> 55:58.369
Just looks like there's a woman
ahead that needs Mommy's help.

55:58.403 --> 56:00.904
-Stay here. Don't move, okay?
-Okay.

56:00.939 --> 56:03.009
I'll be right back.

56:12.751 --> 56:14.350
-Please, help!
-Are you hurt?

56:14.385 --> 56:15.887
You've got to get me
out of here.

56:15.921 --> 56:17.256
No, just a bump on my head.

56:17.289 --> 56:19.524
The power line...

56:19.557 --> 56:22.193
I can't be here. I gotta get to
work. I can't lose my job.

56:22.227 --> 56:24.530
I know, I know, okay,
just calm down.

56:29.301 --> 56:30.369
Are you almost...

56:32.236 --> 56:35.506
Listen, little girl, I want you
to do everything that I say.

56:35.539 --> 56:37.342
I don't wanna hear
a peep out of you,

56:37.376 --> 56:39.877
otherwise I'll
have to cut you.

56:39.910 --> 56:43.115
I can't be here anymore.
Can't I just step out?

56:43.147 --> 56:45.117
No, don't... don't do anything.

56:45.149 --> 56:48.053
Just... just give me a second
to figure things out.

56:54.792 --> 56:56.861
The aliens are coming,

56:56.894 --> 56:59.731
so the mother ship...
We need to get to it.

56:59.765 --> 57:01.600
Okay. Quietly now.

57:01.633 --> 57:03.569
Let's get out.

57:08.606 --> 57:10.909
Mommy!

57:12.943 --> 57:14.545
Don't leave me!

57:14.578 --> 57:16.214
You make a peep,
the mother ship doesn't like...

57:16.247 --> 57:18.117
In front of the people?

57:18.149 --> 57:19.952
Don't you hurt my baby.

57:19.984 --> 57:22.488
Okay? You just let her go,
mister.

57:22.521 --> 57:24.823
I'll shoot you dead. Do you
understand? Just let her go.

57:24.856 --> 57:27.258
Captain Owen doesn't care
about guns,

57:27.292 --> 57:30.261
and god, this is it, there's
nothing you can do about it.

57:30.294 --> 57:31.629
The world is over.

57:31.662 --> 57:33.931
I'm gonna tell you
one more time.

57:33.964 --> 57:35.566
Let her go or I'll shoot you
dead if you hurt her.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.769
Just let her go.

57:38.703 --> 57:39.805
Argh!

57:41.772 --> 57:44.343
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

57:49.214 --> 57:51.517
Don't leave me!

57:56.120 --> 57:58.356
Aahh!

58:01.126 --> 58:02.528
Help!

58:20.044 --> 58:23.515
Dr. Stoker, this is Thunderclap.
Are you reading me?

58:25.216 --> 58:27.985
<i>Dr. Stoker, are you reading me?</i>

58:28.019 --> 58:29.854
Dr. Stoker?

58:29.888 --> 58:33.692
No, it's Daniel Ashe. I'm...

58:33.725 --> 58:35.794
<i>Listen, Daniel,
we don't have a lot of time.</i>

58:35.827 --> 58:38.129
You two were right.
The tsunami is still coming.

58:38.162 --> 58:39.330
We really need your help.

58:39.363 --> 58:40.665
The tsunami is stronger
than ever

58:40.698 --> 58:43.468
and headed straight
to Los Angeles.

58:43.502 --> 58:46.538
Do you two have any ideas?

58:46.571 --> 58:48.507
I think we just might
have something.

58:53.111 --> 58:56.815
Ms. Simms... Tori...

58:56.847 --> 59:00.351
Have you been able to get
a hold of Dr. Stoker?

59:00.385 --> 59:02.321
I've been in touch
with Daniel,

59:02.354 --> 59:05.424
and he is coming
through right now.

59:05.457 --> 59:08.560
Mr. Ashe.

59:08.593 --> 59:12.765
<i>Yes. Yes.
Can you hear me, Colonel?</i>

59:14.198 --> 59:17.068
Hang on everybody!
Here comes another one!

59:49.167 --> 59:52.471
Daniel, we lost 'em.
What happened?

59:52.504 --> 59:54.940
It must've been on there end.

59:54.972 --> 59:57.608
That last tremor must've knocked
out their communications.

59:57.642 --> 01:00:00.245
Daniel, we're
running out of time.

01:00:00.278 --> 01:00:03.147
I know, I'm...
I'm just running out of ideas.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:06.584
Well, maybe we've done
all we can.

01:00:06.618 --> 01:00:09.588
You know, this may be your
last time to get away.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.889
What?

01:00:11.923 --> 01:00:13.725
No.

01:00:13.758 --> 01:00:15.560
No, we can do this.

01:00:15.593 --> 01:00:17.162
It's only temporary.
They'll fix it.

01:00:17.194 --> 01:00:18.463
We need to give them
more time.

01:00:18.497 --> 01:00:20.999
What about Allison?

01:00:21.031 --> 01:00:24.602
She's fine.

01:00:24.635 --> 01:00:25.903
We will be too.

01:00:25.937 --> 01:00:28.106
We're not going anywhere.

01:00:28.138 --> 01:00:31.343
All right. All right,
let's keep trying then.

01:00:31.376 --> 01:00:35.448
You know what? We just may be
onto something here.

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:05.530
Colonel.

01:01:05.965 --> 01:01:07.957
Colonel, can you hear me?

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:10.480
-Toni, are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:01:10.515 --> 01:01:12.150
Anybody else hurt?

01:01:12.182 --> 01:01:13.311
All right, good.

01:01:13.312 --> 01:01:15.724
Toni, see what you can do to get
us back up and running.

01:01:15.725 --> 01:01:17.397
We still get a job to do.

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:20.025
Toni!

01:01:20.057 --> 01:01:21.993
Okay, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.

01:01:22.026 --> 01:01:25.629
-Go one. We got this.
-Okay.

01:01:25.664 --> 01:01:28.499
Colonel. Colonel,
can you hear me?

01:01:28.533 --> 01:01:29.902
Where's the vice president?

01:01:29.935 --> 01:01:31.336
Last I saw her,
she was in the break room.

01:01:31.368 --> 01:01:33.571
She appeared to be all right.

01:01:33.604 --> 01:01:36.675
Ready?
One, two, three.

01:01:41.613 --> 01:01:44.550
Gunny...

01:01:44.582 --> 01:01:47.019
Don't make the
same mistake I made.

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:49.722
Use... your gut.

01:01:52.423 --> 01:01:54.525
You'll be okay, Colonel.
Let's get you up.

01:02:17.247 --> 01:02:19.150
Damn...

01:02:30.428 --> 01:02:32.330
Really?

01:02:45.843 --> 01:02:47.912
<i>No one is available
to take your call.</i>

01:02:47.946 --> 01:02:49.247
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.450
Daniel, it's Allison.

01:02:51.482 --> 01:02:54.218
I don't know why you're
not answering.

01:02:54.252 --> 01:02:56.888
My car just stopped
in the back of an alley.

01:02:56.921 --> 01:03:01.259
I'm on... 7th and... Wilshire.

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:03.462
Please give me a call back when
you get the chance,

01:03:03.495 --> 01:03:06.298
or, I don't know... I haven't
even gotten out of the city yet,

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.633
so I don't know what to do.

01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:10.603
Help.

01:03:14.272 --> 01:03:16.908
Toni. What do you got?

01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:21.446
Not good. We're running on
emergency power only right now,

01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:23.281
but it's only working
for the lights.

01:03:23.314 --> 01:03:26.084
We gotta find a way to get power
back to those systems.

01:03:26.117 --> 01:03:27.785
The earthquake must've
tripped the breakers

01:03:27.818 --> 01:03:30.021
as a safety precaution.

01:03:30.055 --> 01:03:31.690
Not very helpful
in this situation.

01:03:33.557 --> 01:03:34.792
Where's the corporal?

01:03:34.825 --> 01:03:35.643
Over there.

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:36.461
I'm here, sir.

01:03:36.493 --> 01:03:37.796
All right, here's what
we're gonna do. Corporal?

01:03:37.828 --> 01:03:39.464
Yes, Gunny.

01:03:39.497 --> 01:03:40.832
You're coming with me
down to the sub-basement.

01:03:40.865 --> 01:03:42.300
We're gonna find a way

01:03:42.332 --> 01:03:44.168
to get those generators
back up and running.

01:03:44.202 --> 01:03:45.671
We're gonna check on the vice
president on the way downstairs.

01:03:45.703 --> 01:03:48.305
Dr. Vickers...

01:03:48.339 --> 01:03:50.242
just do something.

01:04:05.356 --> 01:04:07.258
Ready for your cardio, Corporal?

01:04:09.093 --> 01:04:10.361
Wait.

01:04:10.394 --> 01:04:12.530
How far down
are we going, Gunny?

01:04:12.564 --> 01:04:14.832
10 more storeys. The breakers
are supposed to be isolated

01:04:14.865 --> 01:04:16.333
for manmade and natural
disasters.

01:04:16.367 --> 01:04:19.571
Like... a mega-tsunami.

01:04:19.604 --> 01:04:21.740
Precisely, Corporal.

01:04:45.964 --> 01:04:48.434
Come on!

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:56.575
Yes!

01:04:58.243 --> 01:04:59.678
Is it working?

01:04:59.711 --> 01:05:02.446
For the moment.

01:05:02.479 --> 01:05:04.982
I'm bringing up the
university feed right now.

01:05:13.825 --> 01:05:15.861
Dr. Stoker, we may not have
much time.

01:05:15.894 --> 01:05:17.696
I'm running on emergency
power now.

01:05:17.729 --> 01:05:20.598
<i>Have you two come up with
anything that might help?</i>

01:05:20.631 --> 01:05:26.437
Yes. Yes. I'm afraid it might
be our only chance, though.

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:27.739
Daniel, they're back.

01:05:30.441 --> 01:05:32.310
You have any news
on the evacuation?

01:05:32.343 --> 01:05:35.046
Last we heard,

01:05:35.078 --> 01:05:37.816
nearly 82% had been evacuated
to a safe distance.

01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:39.818
Good. Good.

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:41.752
Here's Daniel.

01:05:41.785 --> 01:05:44.923
He has an idea,
but it's drastic.

01:05:49.993 --> 01:05:51.997
What do you have in mind?

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.298
An earthquake.

01:06:08.278 --> 01:06:09.847
What you got, Corporal?

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.019
I'm not sure, Gunny.

01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:16.086
I've definitely seen something
like this before, but...

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.356
But what?

01:06:20.357 --> 01:06:22.593
The fuse is blown.

01:06:22.627 --> 01:06:24.530
We don't have another on.

01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:28.634
Let me in there.

01:06:33.638 --> 01:06:36.040
We gotta find something
to bridge this gap.

01:06:40.077 --> 01:06:42.112
I miss you, Daddy.

01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:46.484
Look, I really think
you should come with us.

01:06:46.517 --> 01:06:49.620
I mean, there's no telling how
long before your ride gets here.

01:06:49.653 --> 01:06:51.488
I appreciate it,
Victoria, really,

01:06:51.522 --> 01:06:53.959
but you've been
a godsend already,

01:06:53.992 --> 01:06:55.292
and I don't want to be a burden.

01:06:55.325 --> 01:06:57.194
You're not a burden, okay?

01:06:57.227 --> 01:06:59.865
What do you say we just
get back on the road?

01:06:59.897 --> 01:07:03.033
Mommy! I want Daddy!

01:07:03.066 --> 01:07:05.736
I know, baby.

01:07:05.769 --> 01:07:09.440
I know...
Me too...

01:07:19.283 --> 01:07:22.253
I hope you guys are okay.

01:07:41.539 --> 01:07:43.441
I love you.
See you soon.

01:07:55.153 --> 01:07:57.756
Yes!

01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:59.725
Topside.

01:08:01.124 --> 01:08:03.560
Listen...

01:08:03.593 --> 01:08:06.431
I really appreciate it, but I'll
be fine. You two go ahead.

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:07.431
Okay.

01:08:09.132 --> 01:08:11.068
God!

01:08:15.506 --> 01:08:17.975
No, you're coming with us.

01:08:28.086 --> 01:08:30.788
All systems check out, Gunny.
We're back at full power.

01:08:30.821 --> 01:08:32.923
Thank you, Corporal.

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:34.892
Now explain that again to me,
Mr. Ashe.

01:08:34.926 --> 01:08:37.662
You want to do what exactly?

01:08:37.694 --> 01:08:39.296
<i>In order to stop the tsunami,</i>

01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:41.466
<i>we need to give it
a place to go.</i>

01:08:41.497 --> 01:08:43.300
<i>And that means
opening a trench.</i>

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:44.734
With?

01:08:44.769 --> 01:08:47.004
An earthquake.

01:08:47.037 --> 01:08:50.274
This is ridiculous!

01:08:50.307 --> 01:08:53.078
The only way to stop the tsunami

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:56.279
is with another counter tsunami.

01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:58.082
We need to use
the satellite again

01:08:58.115 --> 01:08:59.950
to find another target area
before it's too late.

01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:03.754
<i>Didn't you learn anything,
the first time around?</i>

01:09:03.787 --> 01:09:05.357
<i>The satellite won't work!</i>

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.959
You simply do not understand
the forces involved.

01:09:08.993 --> 01:09:11.363
You are as outdated
as your data.

01:09:11.395 --> 01:09:14.832
Gentlemen, please...

01:09:14.865 --> 01:09:17.002
How big of a trench
are we talking about?

01:09:17.033 --> 01:09:20.604
<i>Big. Real big.</i>

01:09:20.636 --> 01:09:22.439
<i>We're gonna have to activate</i>

01:09:22.471 --> 01:09:25.943
<i>the Newport-Inglewood Rose
Canyon fault zone somehow.</i>

01:09:25.975 --> 01:09:27.111
Wait a minute...

01:09:27.145 --> 01:09:28.779
<i>It should do the rest for us.</i>

01:09:28.812 --> 01:09:32.515
Are you talking about dropping
Santa Monica Pier, LAX,

01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:35.051
and more into the ocean?

01:09:35.086 --> 01:09:37.219
-You are insane!
-Quiet!

01:09:37.254 --> 01:09:39.189
Madam Vice President,
what do you think?

01:09:39.221 --> 01:09:42.792
Ms. Sims, what are the
evacuation numbers?

01:09:44.328 --> 01:09:48.466
Coastlines are... 89% evacuated.

01:09:48.497 --> 01:09:51.336
FEMA's running into resistance
from some of the locals.

01:09:51.368 --> 01:09:55.807
Looks like we don't
have a choice, Gunny.

01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:58.709
What will it take to
activate that fault line?

01:09:58.743 --> 01:10:01.646
<i>We need a big,
localized bang, Gunny.</i>

01:10:01.678 --> 01:10:03.815
<i>One that will reverberate
through the crust,</i>

01:10:03.847 --> 01:10:06.051
<i>along the fault.</i>

01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:07.985
I think we have
something like that.

01:10:08.019 --> 01:10:10.989
Send me the coordinates.

01:10:11.021 --> 01:10:12.524
You do realize if we do this,

01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:14.425
people will die,
Madam Vice President.

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:18.262
And if we don't do it,
even more will die.

01:10:18.296 --> 01:10:21.165
This is an earthquake
versus a tsunami.

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:24.903
Whichever one wins, we lose.

01:10:24.936 --> 01:10:26.504
You best get cracking, Gunny.

01:10:26.537 --> 01:10:28.873
We still have the option
to use the satellite.

01:10:28.905 --> 01:10:31.408
We can move it closer
to the shore.

01:10:31.441 --> 01:10:34.745
No. We're going with Mr. Ashe's
plan. You had your chance.

01:10:36.446 --> 01:10:37.748
He's a student intern.

01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:40.584
Doctor, it's done.

01:10:40.618 --> 01:10:43.455
Toni, I need you to get
a hold of Black Talon 5,

01:10:43.488 --> 01:10:47.124
have them drop us a package in
Mr. Ashe's coordinates.

01:10:51.662 --> 01:10:54.098
Black Talon 5,
this is Thunderclap,

01:10:54.132 --> 01:10:55.934
do you read me? Over.

01:10:55.967 --> 01:10:58.036
Corporal, you're coming with me.

01:10:58.069 --> 01:11:00.038
We've got an earthquake
to set off.

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.439
Wait, wait...

01:11:05.409 --> 01:11:08.113
Let me go with you.

01:11:08.145 --> 01:11:10.648
Gunny, please,
I need to do this.

01:11:15.086 --> 01:11:16.954
All right, you're with us,
but you stay out of the way

01:11:16.988 --> 01:11:18.656
and do as you're told.
You understand?

01:11:35.338 --> 01:11:37.274
Keep your fingers crossed.

01:11:41.012 --> 01:11:44.315
Setting off an earthquake can
have indeterminable results.

01:11:44.347 --> 01:11:46.751
I feel confident it will work.

01:11:46.784 --> 01:11:50.955
It's past time you
got out of here.

01:11:50.988 --> 01:11:52.856
Now's your time to
take your best shot

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:55.627
while things are still
somewhat calm.

01:12:54.118 --> 01:12:55.852
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

01:12:55.886 --> 01:13:00.158
<i>A 7.3 earthquake has struck
central Los Angeles.</i>

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:03.595
<i>Hundreds of reports are coming
in now from frazzled residents</i>

01:13:03.628 --> 01:13:06.331
<i>who are witnessing major
structural damage</i>

01:13:06.364 --> 01:13:08.433
<i>to many roads and buildings.</i>

01:13:08.466 --> 01:13:10.901
<i>The US government has issued
a state of emergency</i>

01:13:10.935 --> 01:13:13.905
<i>for the entire city
of Los Angeles.</i>

01:13:13.937 --> 01:13:15.940
<i>Let's go to our on-the-spot
reporter, Mary,</i>

01:13:15.972 --> 01:13:19.276
<i>who is on Sepulveda Boulevard
and in the midst of this chaos.</i>

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:20.477
<i>Mary?</i>

01:13:48.138 --> 01:13:49.975
Hey... hey!
Help me, help me!

01:13:58.181 --> 01:14:01.285
I don't know what you want
from me! I don't get it!

01:14:01.319 --> 01:14:05.123
Aahh!

01:14:05.155 --> 01:14:07.091
Get out of here! Go!

01:14:15.865 --> 01:14:17.502
We have to get out of here.

01:14:17.534 --> 01:14:19.470
I can't... We gotta
get out of here.

01:14:19.503 --> 01:14:24.342
Like, now.

01:14:24.374 --> 01:14:25.575
Okay...

01:14:25.609 --> 01:14:27.512
, it's coming?

01:14:32.482 --> 01:14:35.953
We gotta go.

01:14:40.024 --> 01:14:41.959
Okay.

01:15:00.177 --> 01:15:01.813
How about giving us a hand
with this GPS, Doc.

01:15:16.427 --> 01:15:18.363
Right here.

01:15:25.569 --> 01:15:27.939
All right, power it up,
Corporal.

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:45.155
She's all powered up, sir.

01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:49.159
You understand that anything
within a half-mile radius

01:15:49.193 --> 01:15:53.330
will be killed from the blast
wave of this machine, right?

01:15:53.364 --> 01:15:58.202
Yes, I know, Doc, but that is
what it was designed to do.

01:15:58.235 --> 01:16:00.905
The earthquake it will set off
is just an added bonus.

01:16:00.937 --> 01:16:03.373
Gunny, we have a problem.

01:16:03.406 --> 01:16:04.742
What is it, Corporal?

01:16:04.775 --> 01:16:06.944
The device isn't connecting.

01:16:06.976 --> 01:16:09.247
We're gonna have to
do this manually.

01:16:10.948 --> 01:16:14.084
All right... Take the doc
and get out of here.

01:16:14.118 --> 01:16:15.553
I got this.

01:16:15.586 --> 01:16:16.754
Sir.

01:16:19.554 --> 01:16:19.554
Sir.

01:16:19.589 --> 01:16:22.394
That's an order,
Corporal!

01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:28.632
What are you
doing, Doc?

01:16:28.665 --> 01:16:30.234
Move over there!

01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:31.601
What do you think
you're doing, Doc?

01:16:31.635 --> 01:16:33.404
Hand me the weapon.

01:16:33.436 --> 01:16:36.373
Put your gun down.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:16:36.406 --> 01:16:37.941
Drop the weapon, Corporal.

01:16:37.975 --> 01:16:39.477
Sir.

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:40.811
Drop the weapon.
That's an order.

01:16:40.845 --> 01:16:42.446
I said drop your weapon,
Corporal.

01:16:48.819 --> 01:16:50.922
I'm gotta make this
thing right, right?

01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:53.423
Don't do this, Doc.

01:16:53.457 --> 01:16:54.926
Don't do this.

01:16:56.193 --> 01:16:58.663
You shot me!

01:16:58.695 --> 01:17:00.631
I can't believe you shot me.

01:17:00.663 --> 01:17:05.335
I'm gonna give you
five minutes...

01:17:05.369 --> 01:17:07.805
to get out of here, before...

01:17:07.837 --> 01:17:09.440
I set this thing off.

01:17:13.843 --> 01:17:17.280
You sure you know what
you're doing, Doc?

01:17:17.314 --> 01:17:20.952
Yeah. I'm gotta make this
right, right?

01:20:20.864 --> 01:20:22.967
Yes!

01:20:24.967 --> 01:20:26.935
-We did it!
-Good job.

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:28.506
Wonderful job.

01:20:40.883 --> 01:20:43.220
<i>Surprisingly, there have been
very few casualties,</i>

01:20:43.253 --> 01:20:46.223
