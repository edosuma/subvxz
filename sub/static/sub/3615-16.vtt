00:03.376 --> 00:05.399
(<i>camera shutter clicking</i>)

00:05.499 --> 00:07.276
PHOEBE:
I hereby

00:07.376 --> 00:09.817
proclaim this tower of sand

00:09.917 --> 00:11.692
Kingdom Phoebeville!

00:11.792 --> 00:13.750
Yay!

00:16.209 --> 00:17.109
Oh!

00:17.209 --> 00:18.567
(<i>giggling</i>)

00:18.667 --> 00:22.376
You know, I don't get it.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.399
Wait, what don't you get?

00:25.499 --> 00:28.901
That you just spent
an hour of your life

00:29.001 --> 00:33.234
building something that is
just gonna be completely...

00:33.334 --> 00:35.399
completely destroyed
and disappear

00:35.499 --> 00:36.399
in about five seconds flat.

00:36.499 --> 00:38.276
Ah, but Phoebeville
will live forever

00:38.376 --> 00:40.067
in the hearts
of the villagers

00:40.167 --> 00:42.399
who came to love it.

00:42.499 --> 00:43.399
Mm-hmm.

00:43.499 --> 00:47.026
What's with the bah-hum
castle attitude there?

00:47.126 --> 00:47.442
What?

00:47.542 --> 00:49.318
Well, the whole
point of today

00:49.418 --> 00:50.775
was to relax
and have fun.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.026
See, and I thought
the point was to give

00:53.126 --> 00:55.399
Piper and Leo some alone
married people time

00:55.499 --> 00:57.650
since they decided to wait
on their honeymoon.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.567
Okay, so you're sure
nothing's wrong?

00:59.667 --> 01:03.609
You know... the beach isn't
exactly my idea of a good time.

01:03.709 --> 01:05.108
Prue, how
is that possible?

01:05.209 --> 01:09.400
Okay, well you're too young
to remember,

01:09.500 --> 01:12.318
but this is where
Grams brought us

01:12.418 --> 01:15.734
after Mom's funeral,
to try and cheer us up.

01:15.834 --> 01:17.067
Oh, wow.

01:17.167 --> 01:17.494
Yeah.

01:17.504 --> 01:19.483
Yeah, but I know
that you love the beach

01:19.583 --> 01:21.859
and I didn't want
to ruin it for you,

01:21.959 --> 01:23.318
but something
about the sand

01:23.418 --> 01:25.567
and the ocean, you know,
it makes me angry.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.625
Why does it
make you angry?

01:29.001 --> 01:31.609
Doesn't Mom's death
make you angry?

01:31.709 --> 01:33.567
It makes me sad.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.692
Well, I don't really do sad
that well, you know?

01:35.792 --> 01:36.859
I didn't even
cry at her funeral.

01:36.959 --> 01:40.151
So seeing Mom at Piper's
wedding and now the beach...

01:40.251 --> 01:44.026
Yeah. So I'm sorry
if I've been a little cranky.

01:44.126 --> 01:45.109
Say no more.

01:45.209 --> 01:48.359
Princess Prue has spoken!

01:48.459 --> 01:51.276
By the orders
of the Queen--

01:51.376 --> 01:52.359
that's me...

01:52.459 --> 01:53.276
Ooh, I got that one.

01:53.376 --> 01:55.359
...Phoebeville
in all of its glory

01:55.459 --> 01:58.942
will be abandoned
for greener pastures.

01:59.042 --> 01:59.817
And two lattes.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.276
Oh, all hail the queen.

02:01.376 --> 02:03.499
Yay, I love
to be hailed.

02:05.499 --> 02:08.334
(<i>shutter clicking</i>)

02:17.792 --> 02:20.399
(<i>shutter clicking</i>)

02:20.499 --> 02:22.399
Hey!

02:22.499 --> 02:26.499
No, no, no, wait!

02:28.209 --> 02:29.318
You okay?

02:29.418 --> 02:30.399
Uh...

02:30.499 --> 02:32.399
there was this woman

02:32.499 --> 02:33.399
and there was a-a-a

02:33.499 --> 02:34.567
shadow next to her.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.067
Had to be demonic.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.817
A shadow?
Like, what do you mean?

02:37.917 --> 02:38.525
Like a Woogie?

02:38.625 --> 02:40.359
No, spookier. Way spookier.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.276
I think I got pictures though.

02:42.376 --> 02:44.499
So much for the lattes.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.750
Looks like there's
a new demon in town.

02:53.084 --> 02:56.692
So... you're new in town?

02:56.792 --> 02:58.442
Yes.

02:58.542 --> 02:59.692
And-And

02:59.792 --> 03:01.399
you will both
be living here?

03:01.499 --> 03:04.399
Sure. Yeah.

03:04.499 --> 03:05.625
That's right.

03:07.251 --> 03:08.567
Oh-Oh, don't
get me wrong.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.399
I'm fine with the whole

03:10.499 --> 03:12.399
alternative lifestyle thing.

03:12.499 --> 03:14.399
I just don't like loud.

03:14.499 --> 03:16.276
Well, you
understand.

03:16.376 --> 03:19.650
Don't like loud. Got it.

03:19.750 --> 03:20.984
Li-Like

03:21.084 --> 03:22.234
the last tenant,

03:22.334 --> 03:23.499
Mr. Turner.

03:24.084 --> 03:25.399
He was a little strange.

03:25.499 --> 03:28.399
And then, of course, he
disappeared without a trace.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.359
But he was nice and quiet,

03:30.459 --> 03:31.942
so I liked him

03:32.042 --> 03:34.209
fine.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.399
Without a trace.

03:37.499 --> 03:39.251
Is that so?

03:39.875 --> 03:41.399
There's demonic residue

03:41.499 --> 03:42.399
all over
this altar.

03:42.499 --> 03:44.359
It's his,
I can sense it.

03:44.459 --> 03:46.442
There's what?
What did you say?

03:46.542 --> 03:49.609
Surely you knew something
strange had happened here.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.109
It is your
responsibility

03:51.209 --> 03:54.234
to divulge such things
to prospective tenants.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.483
Now, listen,
I don't know...

03:55.583 --> 03:58.400
And the fact that you failed
to show us the altar

03:58.500 --> 03:59.399
makes us wonder

03:59.499 --> 04:01.525
what else about
Cole Turner

04:01.625 --> 04:03.318
you might
be hiding inside

04:03.418 --> 04:06.318
of that tiny
human brain of yours.

04:06.418 --> 04:08.775
(<i>crying</i>):
Wait, I don't underst...

04:08.875 --> 04:10.399
Don't try to talk.

04:10.499 --> 04:13.483
Your brain stem
will do the talking for you.

04:13.583 --> 04:17.500
(<i>screaming</i>)

04:22.750 --> 04:24.400
Is Belthazor alive?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.359
She didn't know.

04:25.459 --> 04:28.459
But she knows someone who might.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.859
PIPER:
<i>Shouldn't I be wearing</i>

05:35.959 --> 05:36.495
white or something?

05:36.505 --> 05:39.399
I mean, it is a
whitelighter
reception and all.

05:39.499 --> 05:41.734
Piper, what
you have on is perfect.

05:41.834 --> 05:42.442
You're beautiful.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.399
All my friends
are gonna love you,

05:44.499 --> 05:46.400
if we could ever get there.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.318
Fine, um,

05:47.418 --> 05:49.901
but I still don't understand
why my sisters can't come.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.318
I mean, we could just do
a group hug thing and...

05:52.418 --> 05:53.775
Well, I can orb you
because you're my wife,

05:53.875 --> 05:55.483
but I'm not a cosmic taxi

05:55.583 --> 05:56.817
for the whole
family.

05:56.917 --> 05:58.499
(<i>chuckles</i>)

05:59.750 --> 06:02.499
You said wife.

06:03.376 --> 06:06.109
All right, I'm as ready
as I'm ever gonna be.

06:06.209 --> 06:08.026
PHOEBE:
Wait, what
about Prue's

06:08.126 --> 06:09.026
demon-looking shadowy thingy?

06:09.126 --> 06:10.901
Well, I promise we'll
be in calling distance

06:11.001 --> 06:14.234
if any demon-looking
shadowy thingy attacks.

06:14.334 --> 06:16.399
All right,
you two,

06:16.499 --> 06:17.399
have fun.

06:17.499 --> 06:19.276
Bring me back a cloud.

06:19.376 --> 06:20.625
Mm...

06:23.875 --> 06:25.109
PRUE:
Phoebes?

06:25.209 --> 06:26.400
Hey, I have to get to Morris,

06:26.500 --> 06:29.151
see if he can help me
track down this woman.

06:29.251 --> 06:30.942
Why? What did you find?
Nothing,

06:31.042 --> 06:32.483
that's the problem--
the shadow didn't

06:32.583 --> 06:34.276
show up in any of the pictures.

06:34.376 --> 06:34.870
Really? That's weird.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.567
Anythingin <i>The Book?</i>

06:37.667 --> 06:39.359
No, nothing.

06:39.459 --> 06:43.792
I didn't really have
a lot to go on though.

06:48.209 --> 06:50.399
Inspector.

06:50.499 --> 06:51.359
How can I help you?

06:51.459 --> 06:53.942
You can tell me where
to find Cole Turner.

06:54.042 --> 06:55.276
I know he's alive,

06:55.376 --> 06:57.459
and I know he's in town.

06:58.499 --> 06:59.400
Really?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.442
Yeah, really.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.942
You want
to know how?

07:02.042 --> 07:03.234
Because his former landlady

07:03.334 --> 07:05.400
was found brutally
murdered at his address.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.499
Mrs. Owens...

07:10.499 --> 07:11.984
Oh, my God. That's awful.

07:12.084 --> 07:14.901
Oh, awful
like you can't imagine.

07:15.001 --> 07:18.167
Uh, Cole didn't do this.

07:18.834 --> 07:19.901
The Cole Turner I know

07:20.001 --> 07:20.567
wouldn't...

07:20.667 --> 07:21.650
The Cole Turner you know?

07:21.750 --> 07:22.859
See, now that
just doesn't sound

07:22.959 --> 07:24.483
like the words of a woman
who claims her boyfriend

07:24.583 --> 07:27.750
left her without
a word four months ago.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.209
I know what you're thinking.

07:33.001 --> 07:35.276
And I know what this looks like.

07:35.376 --> 07:36.276
And I am...

07:36.376 --> 07:38.984
I am so sorry
for what happened today.
You're sorry?

07:39.084 --> 07:40.901
Her eyes were
frozen open in terror.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.901
Her skull was punctured
in two places.

07:43.001 --> 07:44.399
And by the time
the police got there,

07:44.499 --> 07:47.442
most of her brain had spilled
out onto the floor.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.483
Be sick,

07:48.583 --> 07:49.692
be horrified,

07:49.792 --> 07:50.609
but don't you stand there

07:50.709 --> 07:52.359
lying to me
and say you're sorry.

07:52.459 --> 07:53.942
PRUE:
All right,
wait a second.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.692
You're talking to her

07:55.792 --> 07:56.399
like she did it.

07:56.499 --> 07:57.483
If she's lying
to protect Turner,

07:57.583 --> 07:59.583
then she might
as well have.

08:00.251 --> 08:03.251
Now for the last
time, where is he?

08:05.499 --> 08:07.775
I'm gonna find him,
Miss Halliwell.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.026
And then I'm gonna
bust his ass.

08:10.126 --> 08:12.667
And then I'm gonna bust yours.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.692
You okay?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.399
He didn't do it, Prue.

08:23.499 --> 08:24.901
I know he didn't do it.

08:25.001 --> 08:28.875
Well, it's not me that
you have to convince.

08:33.499 --> 08:34.984
Oh, my God.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.708
That's her, the woman
from the beach.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.792
All right, look!
Do you see it?

08:42.833 --> 08:46.126
No. All I see is Inspector
Davidson and the woman.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.399
What does
this mean?

08:51.499 --> 08:53.525
Is he having her follow us?

08:53.625 --> 08:55.609
PRUE:
I'm more concerned
about what's

08:55.709 --> 08:56.399
following her.

08:56.499 --> 08:57.942
I-I don't understand
why you can't see it.

08:58.042 --> 09:00.399
That doesn't
matter, Prue, you can.

09:00.499 --> 09:01.151
Do you think

09:01.251 --> 09:03.567
this has anything to do
with the landlady's death?

09:03.667 --> 09:07.167
Well, it would be a pretty big
coincidence if it didn't.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.609
All right, I'm gonna follow her,
protect her from it.

09:10.709 --> 09:11.859
If I'm
the only one

09:11.959 --> 09:13.109
who can see it,
that must mean

09:13.209 --> 09:14.650
that I'm meant to fight it.

09:14.750 --> 09:15.942
All right,
but the way the Inspector

09:16.042 --> 09:17.692
was describing the murder...

09:17.792 --> 09:19.399
I know, I'll be careful.

09:19.499 --> 09:21.067
Look, you should
find Cole,

09:21.167 --> 09:23.192
tell him what happened
and see if he knows

09:23.292 --> 09:26.399
anything about this
shadow thing, okay?

09:26.499 --> 09:28.499
All right. Bye.

09:36.418 --> 09:38.399
I'd better get out of here.

09:38.499 --> 09:39.609
What? Why?

09:39.709 --> 09:42.067
Because
it's getting too dangerous.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.192
So you're just gonna
disappear again?

09:43.292 --> 09:44.650
If that's what it takes
to keep you safe.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.318
What about keeping
me sane, Cole?

09:47.418 --> 09:48.734
I'm not gonna lose you again.

09:48.834 --> 09:49.234
Some demon

09:49.334 --> 09:51.775
obviously knows I'm alive,
or at least suspects it.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.318
Why else would they
have killed my landlady?

09:54.418 --> 09:55.109
And if they killed her,

09:55.209 --> 09:57.276
they'll kill anybody
they have to to get to me.

09:57.376 --> 09:59.192
That is exactly why
you cannot leave.

09:59.292 --> 09:59.817
We have

09:59.917 --> 10:02.442
to stop them
before they hurt anybody else.

10:02.542 --> 10:05.792
Or before they hurt you.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.234
They're after me, Phoebe.

10:12.334 --> 10:14.483
This is my battle.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.418
I'll handle it.

10:17.625 --> 10:18.917
Cole.

10:19.792 --> 10:20.609
I love you.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.276
And if holding on to that

10:22.376 --> 10:24.567
means that
I have to fight a couple

10:24.667 --> 10:27.399
of extra demons along the way...

10:27.499 --> 10:29.292
then bring 'em on.

10:34.126 --> 10:35.567
Unfortunately
we have no idea

10:35.667 --> 10:36.734
what we're dealing with.

10:36.834 --> 10:39.151
A strange shadow
that only Prue can see?

10:39.251 --> 10:42.067
I haven't the slightest
idea what that could be.

10:42.167 --> 10:45.026
So we'll figure it out.

10:45.126 --> 10:47.359
(<i>sighs</i>)

10:47.459 --> 10:48.483
Together.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.942
It won't bring
Mrs. Owens back,

10:51.042 --> 10:54.067
but trust me,
avenging an innocent

10:54.167 --> 10:56.376
feels pretty damn good.

11:06.001 --> 11:08.775
WOMAN:
I don't see anything
remotely suspicious.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.442
Oh, unless you consider hot
pink pedicures subversive.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.984
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

11:16.084 --> 11:18.775
You really think these
women are murderers?

11:18.875 --> 11:20.901
I'm not sure
what I think.

11:21.001 --> 11:23.483
No, see, there's something
you're not telling me.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.026
Look, I know I'm a rookie
and all, but I think

11:26.126 --> 11:28.875
I have a right to know what
I'm looking for here.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.067
Look, Andrea...

11:32.167 --> 11:35.400
I've seen things
on this case that...

11:35.500 --> 11:38.109
that aren't right,
that...

11:38.209 --> 11:40.942
Look, I don't know what
I'm looking for, okay,

11:41.042 --> 11:43.609
but until I do, I want you
to keep your distance

11:43.709 --> 11:45.984
and just keep following
Phoebe Halliwell.

11:46.084 --> 11:48.609
(<i>clears throat</i>)

11:48.709 --> 11:50.859
So why don't you at least
take the night off,

11:50.959 --> 11:53.525
go home and get some sleep
for Pete's sake, hmm?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.400
No, no,
no I can't, nuh-uh.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.650
Not till this is over.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.026
I'll tell you
what, um...

11:59.126 --> 12:01.399
You can drop the photos off
on my desk and go on home.

12:01.499 --> 12:04.026
You can pick it up
again tomorrow.

12:04.126 --> 12:04.984
Reece...

12:05.084 --> 12:07.084
That's an order.

12:09.376 --> 12:10.399
Have a good night.

12:10.499 --> 12:13.042
All right. You, too.

12:33.209 --> 12:34.399
Oh, God.

12:34.499 --> 12:36.542
You okay?

12:40.499 --> 12:41.567
Try not to touch anything.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.399
You don't want to leave
your fingerprints.

12:43.499 --> 12:45.109
But if I want
to get a premonition...

12:45.209 --> 12:48.499
Use the back of your hand.

13:04.334 --> 13:06.209
Did you find something?

13:10.499 --> 13:11.442
It's just this place.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.209
It's strange to be back here.

13:15.001 --> 13:15.525
I know.

13:15.625 --> 13:18.499
It's strange for me, too.

13:19.251 --> 13:23.859
This was the first taste
I ever had of a normal life.

13:23.959 --> 13:28.400
There were mornings I'd wake up
next to you, and...

13:28.500 --> 13:31.499
I didn't feel evil.

13:32.167 --> 13:36.418
I was just a guy
in love with a beautiful girl.

13:39.750 --> 13:43.399
I wanted it so much,

13:43.499 --> 13:45.399
I started to believe my own lie.

13:45.499 --> 13:48.583
That's not a lie anymore.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.775
We can have that.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.001
We can have a life together.

13:55.499 --> 13:56.901
How?

13:57.001 --> 13:57.775
Well...

13:57.875 --> 13:59.525
By taking out the bad guys

13:59.625 --> 14:02.792
who want
to take it away from us.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.499
(<i>gasps</i>)

14:19.001 --> 14:20.499
(<i>snarls</i>)

14:21.542 --> 14:24.318
What did you see?

14:24.418 --> 14:25.399
Prue.

14:25.499 --> 14:27.734
She turned her back.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.067
Why didn't she

14:29.167 --> 14:30.942
do anything to stop them?

14:31.042 --> 14:32.109
Stop who?

14:32.209 --> 14:35.399
Uh, uh, demons.

14:35.499 --> 14:39.442
They, uh,
sort of had vampire teeth

14:39.542 --> 14:41.942
and they were floating.

14:42.042 --> 14:43.859
They were killing Davidson.

14:43.959 --> 14:44.775
I know them.

14:44.875 --> 14:45.483
They're Seekers.

14:45.583 --> 14:49.984
They have ways of gathering
information fast.

14:50.084 --> 14:50.650
Really fast.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.442
Do you know how
to vanquish them?

14:52.542 --> 14:54.109
No.

14:54.209 --> 14:57.418
Well, let's hope
<i>The Book of Shadows</i> does.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.192
Oh, my God.

15:05.292 --> 15:06.483
Oh, you startled me.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.399
Uh, are you waiting

15:08.499 --> 15:09.609
for Inspector Davidson?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.901
Are you expecting him?

15:12.001 --> 15:13.276
Uh, not tonight.

15:13.376 --> 15:15.399
He's in the field.

15:15.499 --> 15:16.399
Where?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.399
I'm sorry.

15:18.499 --> 15:19.650
(<i>gasps</i>)

15:19.750 --> 15:22.499
I don't know.

15:25.499 --> 15:28.001
Are you sure about that?

15:36.959 --> 15:40.542
(<i>woman screaming</i>)

15:41.167 --> 15:42.399
DEMON 1:
What did she know?

15:42.499 --> 15:43.399
DEMON 2:
Nothing.

15:43.499 --> 15:45.067
He told her nothing.

15:45.167 --> 15:47.399
Which means
he definitely knows something.

15:47.499 --> 15:49.459
(<i>grunts</i>):
Mm-hmm.

16:04.001 --> 16:07.499
I'm beyond your powers.

16:11.084 --> 16:12.499
It's time.

16:19.418 --> 16:20.901
Who are you?

16:21.001 --> 16:23.042
I'm Death.

16:24.959 --> 16:27.500
And I'll be back.

16:42.625 --> 16:43.359
Here it is.

16:43.459 --> 16:46.942
"The Seekers, they
gather information

16:47.042 --> 16:51.399
by feeding on their victims'
brain stem cells."

16:51.499 --> 16:52.026
Lovely.

16:52.126 --> 16:54.067
Which means my landlady
must have talked

16:54.167 --> 16:55.483
to Inspector Davidson about me.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.234
That's why
they're after him.

16:57.334 --> 16:57.996
Does it say anything

16:58.006 --> 17:01.942
about demons
taking on shadow form?

17:02.042 --> 17:04.318
No, but it does have a vanquish.

17:04.417 --> 17:05.901
Do you want to see it?

17:06.001 --> 17:07.376
Oh, no, no.

17:07.499 --> 17:09.398
Last time I touched
that book, it electrocuted me.

17:09.499 --> 17:12.942
Yeah, well, maybe that's because
your intentions were evil.

17:13.041 --> 17:16.398
Maybe it knows now that
you're trying to be good.

17:16.499 --> 17:18.499
Better safe than sorry.

17:20.126 --> 17:24.334
Oh, all right, I need <i>The Book.</i>

17:24.499 --> 17:27.901
Wait a second, what is he doing
here next to it?

17:28.001 --> 17:30.192
Keeping my distance.
Don't worry.

17:30.292 --> 17:31.817
PHOEBE:
Uh, pardon the potential

17:31.917 --> 17:33.192
understatement of a clichÃ©

17:33.292 --> 17:35.318
but you look like
you've seen a ghost.

17:35.418 --> 17:39.167
Yeah, among other things,
I lost my innocent.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.399
Davidson?
No, his partner.

17:41.499 --> 17:42.399
I mean, she was out of my sight

17:42.499 --> 17:44.192
for two seconds,
and then they got her.

17:44.292 --> 17:45.500
Was that them?

17:46.376 --> 17:48.067
PRUE:
Uh, yeah,

17:48.167 --> 17:49.151
actually I think so.

17:49.251 --> 17:50.650
PHOEBE:
They're demonic

17:50.750 --> 17:51.567
lie detectors.

17:51.667 --> 17:52.984
Only no one
survives their test.

17:53.084 --> 17:54.399
COLE:
They killed Mrs. Owens

17:54.499 --> 17:55.817
and now they're after Davidson.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.276
To get to you.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.499
Yes, to get to me.

18:03.251 --> 18:05.276
Maybe I should deal
with this on my own.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.499
No, you can't.

18:08.126 --> 18:09.192
You know,

18:09.292 --> 18:10.399
you said it yourself--

18:10.499 --> 18:12.625
you don't know how
to vanquish them.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.567
Um, unfortunately,
this isn't the only evil

18:15.667 --> 18:17.151
we're up against either.

18:17.251 --> 18:18.399
You mean the Shadow?

18:18.499 --> 18:19.984
Oh, yeah.

18:20.084 --> 18:21.734
Leo!

18:21.834 --> 18:23.834
Leo!

18:26.042 --> 18:27.400
Uh, what's
with the lamp?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.399
Wedding present.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.399
Bright, isn't it?

18:31.499 --> 18:32.483

Uh, yeah.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.067
Um, Leo, is there such a thing
as Death?

18:35.167 --> 18:36.859
I mean the angel of death?

18:36.959 --> 18:39.399
Yeah, sure. Why?

18:39.499 --> 18:40.984
Because I met him.

18:41.084 --> 18:42.399
What? Are you
kidding me?

18:42.499 --> 18:43.775
PRUE:
Yeah, that's how
the shadow

18:43.875 --> 18:46.234
introduced himself to me
when he took Davidson's partner.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.276
And then he said that
he would be back, too.

18:49.376 --> 18:50.399
I'm assuming for Davidson.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.399
He's not working
with the demons.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.192
No, he can't be.

18:53.292 --> 18:54.609
The angel of death
isn't evil.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.067
The hell he isn't.

18:56.167 --> 18:56.901
And if I can see him,

18:57.001 --> 18:58.984
that must mean that
I'm supposed to stop him.

18:59.084 --> 19:00.318
LEO:
Prue, you can't
stop him.

19:00.418 --> 19:02.775
The angel of death always
gets who he comes for.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.734
Yeah, well not this time.

19:03.834 --> 19:06.318
All right, I need to get
ahold of Davidson.

19:06.418 --> 19:07.399
If I can get him here,

19:07.499 --> 19:08.609
I can protect him better.

19:08.709 --> 19:09.650
PIPER:
Hold it. Davidson?

19:09.750 --> 19:11.399
As in Reece Davidson,

19:11.499 --> 19:12.399
the DA investigator?

19:12.499 --> 19:13.276
He's the innocent?

19:13.376 --> 19:14.442
Yeah, is there a problem?

19:14.542 --> 19:15.859
One great big giant one.

19:15.959 --> 19:16.817
Prue, we can't
protect him

19:16.917 --> 19:18.067
without telling him
we're witches.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.734
Yeah, I know that, Piper,
but I don't care, okay?

19:20.834 --> 19:21.984
I cannot stand by

19:22.084 --> 19:23.901
and watch Death take that man.

19:24.001 --> 19:25.026
But that's what you do.

19:25.126 --> 19:26.567
At least according
to my premonition.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.625
You turn your back
when the demons attack.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.318
No, that doesn't make any sense.

19:35.418 --> 19:36.984
I know, but it's what I saw.

19:37.084 --> 19:39.109
Yeah, well, then you saw wrong.

19:39.209 --> 19:40.399
I am not going to let

19:40.499 --> 19:41.192
Death take any more

19:41.292 --> 19:43.067
of my innocents.
I'm tired of losing people.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.276
So Phoebe, do you have
Davidson's card?

19:46.376 --> 19:48.001
Mm-hmm.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.834
Excuse me.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.026
I thought I was protecting
her, man, but...

20:13.126 --> 20:14.775
You all right, Inspector?

20:14.875 --> 20:16.399
I should have warned her.

20:16.499 --> 20:19.067
Man, I should have
told her everything.

20:19.167 --> 20:21.399
What exactly should
you have told her?

20:21.499 --> 20:22.442
Look, all that matters is

20:22.542 --> 20:25.276
I'm going to take down
the guy who did this,

20:25.376 --> 20:27.609
(<i>pager beeping</i>)
no matter what.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.067
If it's the last thing I...

20:29.167 --> 20:31.499
I've got to take this.

20:42.499 --> 20:44.734
Forget about the Halliwells.
It's me you're after.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.984
I'll tell you whatever you
want to know, I promise.

20:47.084 --> 20:48.151
Just not here, it's not safe.

20:48.251 --> 20:50.399
Don't touch me.
You're under arrest, Turner.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.399
And I'm going
to personally

20:51.499 --> 20:53.399
see to it...
Wait. Shh.

20:53.499 --> 20:55.084
What do you mean, wait?!

21:04.959 --> 21:05.984
Did you sense that?

21:06.084 --> 21:09.499
Belthazor's alive.

21:09.959 --> 21:10.859
(<i>gasps</i>)

21:10.959 --> 21:13.318
I'm sorry, but it
was our only chance.

21:13.418 --> 21:14.817
They might be able
to track me,

21:14.917 --> 21:18.609
but they'll have a hard time
sensing me in a cemetery.

21:18.709 --> 21:20.318
How... how did we get...

21:20.418 --> 21:22.400
Wh-What the hell is happening?

21:22.500 --> 21:24.334
W-What's happening to me?

21:25.001 --> 21:26.734
Just... breathe.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.901
Try to calm down.

21:29.001 --> 21:31.499
What are you?

21:32.499 --> 21:37.209
Someone who just
saved your life.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.026
Try to calm down,
Inspector.

21:40.126 --> 21:43.399
If I were a murderer,
I'd have killed you by now.

21:43.499 --> 21:46.276
Just-Just let me go, then.

21:46.376 --> 21:49.276
I'll-I'll just walk away.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.399
I can't do that.

21:51.499 --> 21:52.609
If the demons
get to you,

21:52.709 --> 21:57.399
they'll find out the way
to get to me is to kill Phoebe,

21:57.499 --> 21:59.984
and I can't let that happen.

22:00.084 --> 22:05.499
When... when you-you say
demon, you...

22:08.126 --> 22:10.625
I don't mean it as a metaphor.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.234
Okay, Davidson
won't answer
our page.

22:19.334 --> 22:21.167
Something must have
happened to him.

22:23.499 --> 22:24.399
Cole's gone.

22:24.499 --> 22:25.037
LEO:
What do you mean gone?

22:25.047 --> 22:27.399
PHOEBE:
I mean he's not here.
I looked everywhere.

22:27.499 --> 22:30.859
He must have gone after Davidson
alone... to protect us.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.692
PIPER:
Yeah, but if
the seekers get

22:32.792 --> 22:33.984
to him first...

22:34.084 --> 22:36.109
We gotta get Cole
to bring him back here.

22:36.209 --> 22:36.817
The mausoleum.

22:36.917 --> 22:38.400
He could have taken him
to the mausoleum.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.984
That's where Cole stays.

22:40.084 --> 22:41.775
Is there any chance
that's where

22:41.875 --> 22:45.399
you saw the Inspector die
in your premonition?

22:45.499 --> 22:46.399
Maybe.

22:46.499 --> 22:46.984
Let's go.

22:47.084 --> 22:48.399
You know, I could astral
there faster.

22:48.499 --> 22:50.400
LEO:
But what if
the demons show up?

22:50.500 --> 22:51.234
You can't vanquish them.

22:51.334 --> 22:52.859
You'll need
the Power of Three spell.

22:52.959 --> 22:53.745
So then I won't vanquish them.

22:53.755 --> 22:56.901
I'll just protect Reece long
enough to get him out of there.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.817
Prue...
Phoebe,
your premonition

22:58.917 --> 23:00.442
is not gonna come true.

23:00.542 --> 23:01.276
I told you,

23:01.376 --> 23:04.625
this is one fight
that Death is not gonna win.

23:06.042 --> 23:08.483
You stay the hell
away from me.

23:08.583 --> 23:12.459
I told you
I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.067
(<i>gasps</i>)

23:15.167 --> 23:16.609
Belthazor, I presume.

23:16.709 --> 23:19.234
I'm sorry, who?

23:19.334 --> 23:20.567
We sensed your shimmer.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.292
You're losing your touch.

23:28.792 --> 23:30.234
Leave him out of this.

23:30.334 --> 23:31.901
Why would
we want him

23:32.001 --> 23:32.859
now that we have you?

23:32.959 --> 23:35.234
Unless the human
knows something Belthazor

23:35.334 --> 23:36.959
doesn't want
us to know.

23:44.542 --> 23:46.167

23:47.167 --> 23:48.500
H-How did you get here?

23:49.001 --> 23:50.399
What the hell's going on?

23:50.499 --> 23:51.399
Well, well, well,

23:51.499 --> 23:55.399
the mighty Belthazor...

24:42.499 --> 24:44.459

24:45.209 --> 24:47.167
It's his time.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.292
Over my dead body.

25:30.209 --> 25:33.399
It's just so... bright.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.287
Well, of course
it's bright.

25:34.297 --> 25:36.399
It's supposed to represent
the light of eternal love.

25:36.499 --> 25:39.109
Wait, does that mean we can
never turn it off?

25:39.209 --> 25:42.399
At this rate, you're gonna turn
it off in record time.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.650
I'm just saying, I-I don't think
it belongs in the living room.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.359
LEO:
Or the parlor...

25:48.459 --> 25:50.775

25:50.875 --> 25:51.525
Pheebs?

25:51.625 --> 25:53.942
Oh, do you think
I'm stupid?

25:54.042 --> 25:54.620
I am staying
out of this.

25:54.630 --> 25:56.442
COLE:
I already told you, Prue,
Besides, I'm more concerned

25:56.542 --> 25:58.067
with...
I wouldn't revert

25:58.167 --> 26:00.692
to my demon form
and I could have used some help!

26:00.792 --> 26:02.399
I was busy
saving Davidson.

26:02.499 --> 26:04.399
No, that's what I was doing.

26:04.499 --> 26:06.109
PHOEBE:
Hello?
What happened?

26:06.209 --> 26:06.817
Is he okay?

26:06.917 --> 26:08.650
He almost wasn't.

26:08.750 --> 26:12.001
The seekers were at the
courthouse waiting for him.

26:12.292 --> 26:13.494
And then they tracked Cole
to the mausoleum.

26:13.504 --> 26:16.192
Well, how do you know
they didn't track you here?

26:16.292 --> 26:17.109
They retreated first.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.399
They have to be close
to a shimmer

26:19.499 --> 26:20.399
to track it.

26:20.499 --> 26:21.399
They retreated?

26:21.499 --> 26:22.234
PRUE:
Yeah.

26:22.334 --> 26:23.109
I kicked ass.

26:23.209 --> 26:24.692
No. You kicked air.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.318
No, I told you

26:25.418 --> 26:26.901
that I was fighting
the angel of death,

26:27.001 --> 26:28.067
and obviously I won.

26:28.167 --> 26:29.875
(<i>scoffs</i>)

26:30.499 --> 26:31.399
Prue, that's not possible.

26:31.499 --> 26:33.276
Well, he's alive, isn't he?

26:33.376 --> 26:34.399
For now, maybe.

26:34.499 --> 26:35.567
But the seekers,
they'll be back

26:35.667 --> 26:37.609
and they'll be out for
blood, mine and yours.

26:37.709 --> 26:40.026
The only thing they don't know
is how to find us.

26:40.126 --> 26:42.567
Yes, and now they know
that Davidson is the key.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.775
If you had have just fought
with me, we might...

26:44.875 --> 26:46.067
You know, you're
not exactly

26:46.167 --> 26:47.525
the poster boy
for teamwork, Cole.

Hey, you were supposed

26:48.959 --> 26:50.567
to stick with
us, remember?

26:50.667 --> 26:53.692
I was trying to protect you.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.109
All of you.

26:55.209 --> 26:57.400
By exposing yourself?

26:57.500 --> 27:00.334
Better me than you.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.901
You know, the one thing you
failed to consider, Cole,

27:03.001 --> 27:04.734
is no matter
how dangerous

27:04.834 --> 27:06.359
Davidson is to us,

27:06.459 --> 27:07.650
you're more dangerous.

27:07.750 --> 27:08.399
Oh, now wait a minute.

27:08.499 --> 27:09.942
I think that I've proven myself
to you...

27:10.042 --> 27:12.625
No, Cole, Cole,
that's not what she meant.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.692
You're a part of our lives now.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.026
You know

27:17.126 --> 27:20.234
almost everything about us.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.042
If you had lost...

27:23.499 --> 27:26.376
The seekers could use
what I know to destroy you.

27:29.583 --> 27:30.567
I better check
with the Elders.

27:30.667 --> 27:31.734
This is getting
complicated.

Uh...

27:39.251 --> 27:40.859

you hit your head.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.399
I didn't hit it that hard!

27:42.499 --> 27:43.318
Whatever I just saw,

27:43.418 --> 27:45.192
it's not... it's not
'cause I hit my head.

27:45.292 --> 27:48.399
Look, I know that
this may seem hard
to believe

27:48.499 --> 27:50.609
after everything
that you've been
through tonight,

27:50.709 --> 27:52.442
but we are on
your side, okay?

27:52.542 --> 27:53.609
We're the good guys.

27:53.709 --> 27:55.692
I don't know what
you people are.

27:55.792 --> 27:59.399
But good isn't topping
my list of ideas.

27:59.499 --> 28:01.984
Be that as it may,
we can't let you leave.

28:02.084 --> 28:02.483
Cole...

28:02.583 --> 28:03.650
Try and stop me!

28:03.750 --> 28:06.151
Inspector, you're in a room
with three witches and a demon.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.499
You really think
that gun's gonna help?

28:09.542 --> 28:10.775
Look...

28:10.875 --> 28:11.734
I don't really know

28:11.834 --> 28:12.734
how to tell you this,

28:12.834 --> 28:18.001
but it's not just demons
that are after you.

28:18.499 --> 28:20.692
The angel of death wants you,
too.

28:20.792 --> 28:21.942
Now please,

28:22.042 --> 28:24.859
please, if you stay here,
we can protect you.

28:24.959 --> 28:27.499
I'm not afraid of death.

28:28.583 --> 28:31.334
You, on the other hand,
are a different matter.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.442
Cole...

28:37.542 --> 28:38.984
He's going to expose you.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.399
He'll gather evidence and...

28:40.499 --> 28:41.942
Cole, we don't kidnap cops

28:42.042 --> 28:43.734
and then hold them
against their will.

28:43.834 --> 28:45.109

But we do follow them

28:45.209 --> 28:46.609
and protect them
against their will.

28:46.709 --> 28:50.292
Come on.
Not you. You stay here.

28:50.499 --> 28:52.400
So what? I'm just, just meant
to wait here?

28:52.500 --> 28:56.399
Yeah, no shimmering,
and lock the door

28:56.499 --> 28:57.942
behind us.

Prue?

28:58.500 --> 28:59.525
You guys go ahead.

28:59.625 --> 29:00.442
But the demons...

29:00.542 --> 29:04.209

29:26.959 --> 29:29.126
before my time.

29:30.834 --> 29:31.984

29:32.084 --> 29:34.109
I know that you can hear me.

29:34.209 --> 29:37.167
Are you sure you
really want me?

29:38.500 --> 29:39.399
I uh...

Come on, I don't

29:40.500 --> 29:41.567
have all day.

29:41.667 --> 29:42.442
There are

29:42.542 --> 29:43.775

29:43.875 --> 29:46.792
who definitely
don't have all day.

So what is it?

29:48.500 --> 29:51.418
Took your husband
and you want him back?

29:52.001 --> 29:53.500
Your brother?

29:54.376 --> 29:56.499
Your mother?

29:57.959 --> 29:58.859
Don't talk about her.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.151
Don't talk about my mother.

30:00.251 --> 30:02.399
That should have been
an easy guess,

30:02.499 --> 30:05.001
with those sad little girl eyes.

30:05.376 --> 30:06.817
All right,
you want Reece Davidson,

30:06.917 --> 30:08.359
and it's my job to protect him,

30:08.459 --> 30:09.609
so what do you want from me?

30:09.709 --> 30:10.525
What do I have to do?

30:10.625 --> 30:12.276
That's not why you called me.

30:12.376 --> 30:14.399
Oh, yes, it is.
No, that's

30:14.499 --> 30:15.067
an excuse.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.399
You're mad at me
for taking Mummy.

30:17.499 --> 30:19.318
I told you
not to talk about her.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.109
What were you, ten?

30:20.209 --> 30:21.859
I'm just guessing now.

30:21.959 --> 30:23.399
Just stop it!

30:23.499 --> 30:24.399
Younger, I bet.

30:24.499 --> 30:26.609
And now you think
by saving this--

30:26.709 --> 30:28.109
which is it, Davidson--

30:28.209 --> 30:30.399
you think
you'll have beaten me somehow,

30:30.499 --> 30:31.859
that somehow you'll have

30:31.959 --> 30:32.609
finally won.

30:32.709 --> 30:34.276
Just go away.
No.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.834
You wanted me,
now you've got me.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.318
You're wasting precious time.

30:39.418 --> 30:41.151
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's not my time

30:41.251 --> 30:42.859
you're wasting, it's yours.

30:42.959 --> 30:44.901
You refuse
to accept me

30:45.001 --> 30:45.567
for what I am,

30:45.667 --> 30:47.567
which keeps you
from mourning me.

30:47.667 --> 30:48.775
You don't know me.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.399
You don't know
anything about me.

30:51.499 --> 30:54.067
But I've seen it
so many times before.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.817
The anger, the pain...

30:55.917 --> 30:58.400
you lock up your
tears and angrily

30:58.500 --> 31:00.192
steel yourself against me,

31:00.292 --> 31:02.399
as if I was the ultimate evil.

31:02.499 --> 31:04.483
You <i>are</i> the ultimate evil.

31:04.583 --> 31:05.399
No.

31:05.499 --> 31:08.567
I'm not good or evil, I just am.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.667
I'm inevitable.

What do I have to do
to save Davidson?

31:15.042 --> 31:17.109
You still don't get it,
do you?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.399
There's nothing you <i>can</i> do.

31:19.499 --> 31:21.734
I can't just let
an innocent man die.

31:21.834 --> 31:22.817
You have to

31:22.917 --> 31:23.859
let him die.

31:23.959 --> 31:24.901
You have no choice.

31:25.001 --> 31:27.859
And until you can
learn to accept that,

31:27.959 --> 31:30.483
you'll just keep missing
the bigger picture.

31:30.583 --> 31:33.126
What bigger picture?

31:33.709 --> 31:35.567
I'll show you.

31:35.667 --> 31:36.859
Oh, don't worry.

31:36.959 --> 31:39.917
It's not your time.

Or not just yet, anyway.

No one's been here.

Yeah, try sitting in a car

No sign of any demons?

32:19.126 --> 32:19.775
No, not yet.

But Davidson led us to a, uh...

32:22.499 --> 32:23.318
To what?

32:23.418 --> 32:24.609
Never mind.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.151
Uh, if Prue comes back,

32:26.251 --> 32:27.400
just tell her to call us.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.318
I love you.

32:29.418 --> 32:30.026
Phoebe...

32:30.126 --> 32:31.442
(<i>phone beeps</i>)

32:31.542 --> 32:33.192
Phoebe!

32:33.292 --> 32:34.667
Okay, so now what?

32:35.042 --> 32:37.067
Well, we can't
crash the funeral.

32:37.167 --> 32:39.399
I guess we just watch from here.

32:39.499 --> 32:40.192
I don't understand.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.234
You tell a guy
that Death is after him,

32:42.334 --> 32:43.525
and he goes to a cemetery?

32:43.625 --> 32:45.399
How smart is that?

32:45.499 --> 32:48.084
(<i>Rabbi continues recitation</i>)

32:55.209 --> 32:56.917
You want me?

32:58.084 --> 32:59.126
Fine.

32:59.750 --> 33:02.667
But these people have
been through enough.

33:08.084 --> 33:10.001
Phoebe.

33:58.292 --> 34:00.126
(<i>hammer clicking</i>)

34:06.376 --> 34:07.399
PHOEBE:
Hey! Hey, Reece!

34:07.499 --> 34:09.792
Get out of
there! Run!

34:17.376 --> 34:20.067
You've been
so brave,

34:20.167 --> 34:20.942
Inspector.

34:21.042 --> 34:23.208
Don't ruin it now.

34:23.917 --> 34:25.399
Where's Belthazor?

34:25.498 --> 34:28.001
Belthazor?

34:33.458 --> 34:34.609
Oh, my God.
It's his time,

34:34.708 --> 34:38.234
just like it was
your mother's time.

34:38.333 --> 34:41.126
Prue! Prue! Open the gate!

34:43.625 --> 34:45.400
Stop fighting me.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.399
Open the gate!

34:46.498 --> 34:47.498
Prue!

35:30.499 --> 35:31.399
(<i>door rattling</i>)

35:31.499 --> 35:32.399
(<i>metallic clang</i>)

35:32.499 --> 35:33.399
(<i>door opening</i>)

35:33.499 --> 35:34.875
PIPER:
Prue?

35:38.875 --> 35:40.067
Are you okay?

35:40.167 --> 35:41.775
I don't know.

35:41.875 --> 35:42.525
What happened?

35:42.625 --> 35:44.109
PHOEBE:
Did the demons

35:44.209 --> 35:45.442
do something to you?

35:45.542 --> 35:46.525
No.

35:46.625 --> 35:47.609
PIPER:
How did you

35:47.709 --> 35:48.817
even get in here?

35:48.917 --> 35:51.399
Uh... Death brought me.

35:51.499 --> 35:52.318
I'm sorry?

35:52.418 --> 35:52.984
PRUE:
You know, I...

35:53.084 --> 35:57.667
I-I don't completely
understand it myself.

35:58.209 --> 36:01.399
Prue, how could you stand
there and let him die?

36:01.499 --> 36:03.399
Because it was
his time, all right?

36:03.499 --> 36:06.067
I wanted to save him,
but I couldn't.

36:06.167 --> 36:07.734
You didn't even try.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.376
I'm sorry.

36:22.334 --> 36:24.499
I'm sorry.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.442
God, I'm so sorry.

36:27.542 --> 36:29.875
(<i>sobbing</i>)

36:32.334 --> 36:36.042
(<i>telephone ringing</i>)

36:45.583 --> 36:46.984
Ever hear of a doorbell?

36:47.084 --> 36:49.499
We thought we'd
surprise you.

36:55.499 --> 36:56.692
ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, we're not home.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.399
You know the drill.

36:58.499 --> 37:00.234
Cole, if you're there,
pick up the phone.

37:00.334 --> 37:01.775
Actually,
don't pick up the phone.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.026
Just get out of the manor.

37:03.126 --> 37:04.192
Should I astral there?

37:04.292 --> 37:06.067
I think we
should stick together.

37:06.167 --> 37:07.151
Faster.

37:07.251 --> 37:09.499
(<i>car horn honks</i>)

37:18.334 --> 37:19.834
(<i>roars</i>)

37:27.292 --> 37:28.542
(<i>roars</i>)

37:46.251 --> 37:48.834
(<i>yelling</i>)

37:57.583 --> 37:58.692
Now, let's see

37:58.792 --> 38:01.459
what you don't want us to know.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.499
(<i>gasps</i>)

38:16.499 --> 38:17.318
Okay, come on.

38:17.418 --> 38:19.209
Come on. Come on.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.209
Prue.

38:32.583 --> 38:33.875
Don't.

38:39.292 --> 38:42.399
"Knowledge gained
by murderous means

38:42.499 --> 38:43.901
"is Wisdom's bitter enemy.

38:44.001 --> 38:46.234
"The mind that burns
with stolen fire,

38:46.334 --> 38:48.959
will now become
your funeral pyre."

38:50.875 --> 38:54.500
(<i>screaming</i>)

39:04.499 --> 39:07.334
Well, at least
we saved one.

39:08.001 --> 39:09.525
Oh, did you hear that?

39:09.625 --> 39:12.067
You just reached
innocent status.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.318
Oh, that's good.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.917
To Prue, no one
is more important.

39:21.167 --> 39:21.692
PIPER:
Wow.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.609
Nice timing. You
missed the show.

39:23.709 --> 39:27.067
I know, but They told me
to miss it. You okay?

39:27.167 --> 39:28.692
Yeah.
PIPER:
What do you mean

39:28.792 --> 39:30.234
They told you
to miss it?

39:30.334 --> 39:32.483
The Elders were
behind this whole thing?

39:32.583 --> 39:34.901
No, but they knew
they had to let Prue

39:35.001 --> 39:38.359
learn a lesson by
herself... the hard way.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.483
What lesson?

39:39.583 --> 39:42.775
That Death is not the evil.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.109
PHOEBE:
You okay?

39:45.209 --> 39:46.499
Yeah.

39:47.709 --> 39:50.334
She just needs
some time.

39:51.499 --> 39:52.399
And <i>we</i> need a maid.

39:52.499 --> 39:53.567
(<i>clearing throat</i>)

39:53.667 --> 39:55.151
PIPER:
Um...

39:55.251 --> 39:56.026
(<i>clearing throat</i>)

39:56.126 --> 39:57.399
you know, I was thinking...

39:57.499 --> 40:00.400
and this lamp is not
worth fighting over. So...

40:00.500 --> 40:04.583
if <i>you</i> love it,
then <i>I</i> love it.

40:05.542 --> 40:06.859
Yeah?

40:06.959 --> 40:07.399
Yeah.

40:07.499 --> 40:10.499
I mean, life's
too short.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.192
Oh!

40:19.292 --> 40:20.834
Wow!

40:21.583 --> 40:24.126
Now I love it even more.

40:39.499 --> 40:41.442
DEATH:
You contemplating the tides?

40:41.542 --> 40:45.625
Can't control them
any more than me.

40:46.499 --> 40:48.692
Okay, I get that
you're not evil,

40:48.792 --> 40:50.483
but what I don't get is why

40:50.583 --> 40:53.026
I wasn't supposed
to fight the demons.

40:53.126 --> 40:55.399
Well, you were
alone and outnumbered.

40:55.499 --> 40:57.399
I still could've fought.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.400
But you would have lost, Prue.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.984
How did you know my name?

41:03.084 --> 41:05.650
I read it off my list.

41:05.750 --> 41:06.442
It was

41:06.542 --> 41:08.859
the next one
after Reece Davidson's.

41:08.959 --> 41:11.399
You were coming for <i>me?</i>

41:11.499 --> 41:14.609
If you hadn't stopped
fighting me, yes.

41:14.709 --> 41:17.026
That's why you were
able to see me.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.234
It's the bigger picture, Prue.

41:19.334 --> 41:21.151
Focusing all your
anger against <i>me</i>

41:21.251 --> 41:25.500
leaves you vulnerable
to the real evils of this world.

41:26.167 --> 41:29.500
You'd do well
to remember that in the future.

41:31.667 --> 41:32.109
What?

41:32.209 --> 41:36.984
I don't know.
You know, I've been...

41:37.084 --> 41:39.834
I've been mad at you
for so long...

41:40.583 --> 41:45.042
...ever since Mom died,
I don't know how else to be.

41:49.001 --> 41:51.483
You grieve...

41:51.583 --> 41:54.292
and then you move on.
