00:01.998 --> 00:03.914
So you understand the situation?

00:04.320 --> 00:05.552
I think so...

00:05.865 --> 00:08.711
Now that we're not married anymore, you want to sell my condo.

00:08.712 --> 00:11.806
No, No...It's our condo. I got it for us.

00:11.946 --> 00:14.207
Not the smartest thing I ever did, but...

00:14.451 --> 00:16.553
My real estate advisor was my penis.

00:18.237 --> 00:21.048
Is that what they mean when they say 'The markets gone soft'?

00:22.697 --> 00:23.777
I don't think so.

00:24.825 --> 00:29.018
My point is I can't afford to carry the mortgage on this place, but if we sell it

00:29.088 --> 00:30.435
we can split the profit.

00:30.644 --> 00:32.479
Or, I could buy you out.

00:32.804 --> 00:33.710
Do you have money?

00:33.815 --> 00:35.778
I will after we sell!

00:36.616 --> 00:40.159
Look Kandi, I'm at the end of my rope. If I can't get out from under these bills

00:40.160 --> 00:42.609
I...I may well have to declare bankruptcy.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.373
Wow...that sounds really serious.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.313
It is! Deadly serious.

00:48.459 --> 00:50.515
Well, in that case...

00:52.745 --> 00:54.185
Want to have sex?

00:54.455 --> 00:55.644
What?

00:55.729 --> 00:58.947
I'm horny, you're stressed. Seems like we both benefit.

00:59.725 --> 01:01.653
Well I am really stressed.

01:02.265 --> 01:03.949
No! It's not going to solve anything!

01:04.275 --> 01:07.062
Ok...Well, I'm going to go take a shower.

01:07.063 --> 01:09.640
- Let me know if you change your mind.
- I changed my mind.

01:18.128 --> 01:20.041
I either drank too much

01:20.617 --> 01:22.875
Or got hit by a train.

01:26.812 --> 01:28.717
Oh God...train.

01:29.487 --> 01:30.757
Charlie.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.183
Oh look.

01:34.671 --> 01:37.575
It's my sweet angel come to take me to heaven.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.282
Don't touch me.

01:41.117 --> 01:42.639
Hope you're proud of yourself.

01:42.948 --> 01:43.726
Well...

01:44.307 --> 01:47.745
I didn't wake up in my own vomit so, yeah. Kind of.

01:49.522 --> 01:51.182
You are such a child.

01:51.786 --> 01:54.225
Many people find that to be an endearing quality.

01:55.224 --> 01:56.603
I'm not one of them.

01:57.671 --> 01:59.293
It would appear not.

02:01.237 --> 02:03.084
We had fun last night though, right?

02:03.188 --> 02:04.605
Oh, terrific!

02:05.093 --> 02:09.959
What woman doesn't enjoy pleasing a man who falls asleep while he's in the middle of reciprocating?

02:11.829 --> 02:15.162
Ah, that explains why I dreamt I was kissing Abe Lincoln.

02:18.426 --> 02:20.098
Uh Oh.

02:28.455 --> 02:29.434
Okay.

02:29.828 --> 02:31.001
Some underwear.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.662
No need to panic.

02:33.557 --> 02:35.624
And a little bit of make-up. No biggie.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.399
Running shoes, reading glasses, flannel nightgown

02:40.515 --> 02:43.431
and the latest issue of Modern Bride magazine.

02:44.220 --> 02:45.103
Red Alert.

02:47.054 --> 02:48.576
- Lydia?
- What?

02:51.277 --> 02:55.237
I couldn't help but notice that you...uh...put some of your stuff in one of my drawers.

02:55.469 --> 02:57.014
Yeah. Hey!

02:57.188 --> 02:59.558
You want to come in here and make up for last night?

02:59.860 --> 03:03.100
Well...yeah...I think we should talk about this drawer thing.

03:03.455 --> 03:04.547
Okay.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.754
Talk.

03:10.807 --> 03:13.072
"Four score and seven years ago.

03:13.073 --> 03:15.848
Fathers brought oath upon this continent...

03:15.849 --> 03:16.681
a new..."

03:16.682 --> 03:35.008
Transcript & Synch : Nuwanda

03:46.292 --> 03:47.276
Morning.

03:48.327 --> 03:50.568
That was a great job.

03:52.409 --> 03:56.804
Yeah, you know it's good when you feel dirtier coming out than you did going in.

03:58.167 --> 03:59.416
So what are you doing?

03:59.594 --> 04:00.486
Just practicing.

04:00.693 --> 04:01.388
For what?

04:01.613 --> 04:03.904
Nothing in particular, just keeping sharp for my work.

04:03.989 --> 04:05.660
Oh yeah, your little...

04:05.942 --> 04:07.078
...jingle thing.

04:08.558 --> 04:10.521
Hard to believe that takes practice.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.178
Berta, I'd like some scrambled egg whites, dry wheat toast, and Earl Grey tea.

04:23.563 --> 04:24.398
Oh yeah?

04:24.539 --> 04:27.741
Well, I'd like some new shoes, a jet pack, and a waistline.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.974
Really thought she was going to make you breakfast?

04:43.796 --> 04:44.698
Yo bro.

04:45.008 --> 04:45.768
Hey.

04:46.519 --> 04:47.477
How did it go with Kandi?

04:47.825 --> 04:50.482
Great...just great!

04:50.838 --> 04:53.815
Turns out, we can be friends with benifits!

04:54.078 --> 04:56.425
Nice, and did she agree to sell the condo?

04:56.426 --> 04:57.101
What?

04:58.735 --> 05:00.942
Isn't that why you went over there in the first place?

05:01.561 --> 05:02.619
Oh yeah.

05:04.731 --> 05:06.759
Son of a Bitch!

05:07.473 --> 05:08.590
Charlie!

05:09.389 --> 05:12.292
- You need to talk to your maid
- Sh sh sh sh! Keep your voice down.

05:12.555 --> 05:14.283
We don't use the "m" word around here.

05:14.527 --> 05:15.457
Why not?

05:15.607 --> 05:17.393
- Because its disrespectful.
- And demeaning.

05:17.394 --> 05:19.477
And wildly inaccurate.

05:23.827 --> 05:26.428
Point is, Berta is the one who keeps this house running.

05:26.775 --> 05:28.634
More importantly, she's kinda like family.

05:28.993 --> 05:30.993
She's rude, offensive and vulgar.

05:31.547 --> 05:33.735
Okay, exactly like family!

05:34.814 --> 05:35.782
Fine.

05:36.187 --> 05:40.544
See if she'll do that thing with the ice cubes and the silk handkerchief you like so much.

05:40.703 --> 05:43.004
Come on sweetie, don't be like that.

05:43.595 --> 05:45.360
Ice cubes and a silk handkerchief?

05:45.609 --> 05:48.079
You can also use a popsicle and a necktie.

05:48.858 --> 05:50.773
I do owe you a silk handkerchief.

05:53.093 --> 05:55.750
And your water pick is kinda iffy.

05:58.182 --> 05:59.816
And what ever you do, 

05:59.994 --> 06:01.600
don't lick your hair brush.

06:07.959 --> 06:11.161
Uh, I'm sorry to come over here and bother you again but,

06:11.162 --> 06:13.396
we never finished talking about selling the condo.

06:13.527 --> 06:17.227
But I don't want to sell the condo. I can see boats from here.

06:17.786 --> 06:21.237
I understand, but I can't afford the payments.

06:21.238 --> 06:23.396
I like boats.

06:25.171 --> 06:26.758
All right, well if you won't...

06:27.142 --> 06:31.638
Won't co-operate I'll just have to call my la-...lawyer. What are you doing?

06:31.775 --> 06:34.673
Chester lost his bone. I'm looking for it.

06:34.771 --> 06:36.507
Now? Can it wait?

06:36.669 --> 06:40.669
No, when Chester wakes up from his nap he's going to want his bone.

06:40.894 --> 06:42.186
You can keep talking.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.904
Okay well uh, well as I said,

06:46.026 --> 06:47.782
If you won't be reasonable, I'll just...

06:48.073 --> 06:48.965
have to...

06:52.286 --> 06:54.063
Have to what Alan?

06:55.471 --> 06:57.862
Son of a Bitch!

07:07.041 --> 07:08.543
What the- ?

07:10.468 --> 07:11.933
We need to talk.

07:15.985 --> 07:17.008
Okay.

07:17.562 --> 07:21.656
I don't mind your girlfriend throwing the occasional thong or panty into the hamper.

07:21.987 --> 07:24.644
I just fold them, and sell them at the swap meet,

07:25.649 --> 07:29.367
but this broad is taking advantage of my easy going nature.

07:30.907 --> 07:31.733
Now

07:32.130 --> 07:33.069
to be fair

07:33.313 --> 07:35.235
Lydia does have her positive attributes.

07:35.285 --> 07:39.511
Yeah well, I ain't hitting any of them attributes, so I don't give a rats ass.

07:40.515 --> 07:41.971
All right, all right.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.689
You know what she said to me Charlie?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.460
She said I need to learn my place around here.

07:46.882 --> 07:48.403
Aww, she didn't.

07:48.563 --> 07:50.432
Ahh, but she did. 

07:52.310 --> 07:53.784
Is that true Charlie?

07:54.180 --> 07:56.537
Do I need to learn my place around here?

07:58.340 --> 07:59.702
No Berta, we all know your place. 

07:59.703 --> 08:01.063
And where is that place Charlie?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.467
Wherever you want it to be. 

08:02.468 --> 08:05.361
There's only room for one Alpha dog in this house. 

08:05.362 --> 08:05.868
I know.

08:05.934 --> 08:07.850
- And who is that Alpha dog Charlie?
- You are.

08:07.934 --> 08:09.446
- Say it!
- You're the Alpha dog!

08:09.521 --> 08:12.594
Aww! You sweet talker you.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.650
We'll just pretend that's morning wood.

08:31.724 --> 08:33.405
Hey! How's it going?

08:34.008 --> 08:36.289
Well, look who is finally up.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.177
I need some lotion on my back.

08:38.778 --> 08:39.857
Oh, sure.

08:40.655 --> 08:43.472
Listen, I have to talk to you about Berta.

08:44.105 --> 08:46.913
For god sake Charlie, grow a pair.

08:48.847 --> 08:50.434
Is this your house or her's?

08:50.800 --> 08:54.321
Well, my name is on the deed but she was here first.

08:54.528 --> 08:59.026
Thing is, over the years, Berta and I have developed a really nice working relationship.

08:59.027 --> 09:00.190
Do my thighs.

09:03.439 --> 09:04.231
Right.

09:04.573 --> 09:08.102
And the key to a happy home, I find, is to not rock the boat.

09:08.321 --> 09:11.923
Not tamper with that balance so you really need to make the effort to treat her -

09:11.924 --> 09:13.130
Where is she now?

09:13.955 --> 09:15.280
Well she went shopping.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.797
Anybody else around?

09:18.068 --> 09:19.818
No, anyway the thing with Berta -

09:19.819 --> 09:22.538
Why don't you put some sunscreen on your cute little bottom.

09:23.434 --> 09:24.267
What for?

09:24.432 --> 09:26.700
'Cause I wouldn't want you to get a nasty burn.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.010
Why would I get a nasty -

09:30.855 --> 09:33.518
ohhh, you mean sex?

09:33.818 --> 09:37.632
Good thing you're pretty 'cause you're very slow. 

09:39.641 --> 09:42.279
Who's the alpha dog Charlie?

09:43.372 --> 09:45.381
Grow a pair Charlie.

09:49.194 --> 09:50.930
Hey Alan come here.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.308
What's going on?

09:53.781 --> 09:55.470
I'm doing Lydia's laundry.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.397
Can I throw in my handkerchief?

09:59.242 --> 10:01.374
That wouldn't help, you'd probably have to burn it.

10:02.741 --> 10:05.586
Okay. And why are you doing Lydia's laundry?

10:05.723 --> 10:07.103
'Cause Berta won't.

10:07.254 --> 10:08.661
And why doesn't Lydia do it herself?

10:08.798 --> 10:10.821
'Cause I told her I'd get Berta to do it.

10:11.176 --> 10:12.215
Ha!

10:12.488 --> 10:14.429
And do you have any idea how to do laundry?

10:14.430 --> 10:16.868
Oh come on, you wash 'em, you dry 'em. How tough could it be?

10:17.101 --> 10:18.522
So what do you need me for?

10:19.834 --> 10:22.076
Which one's the washer?

10:25.247 --> 10:26.299
That one.

10:26.761 --> 10:27.950
Thanks.

10:29.494 --> 10:31.326
Just kidding. It's that one.

10:33.731 --> 10:35.563
Sorry, it was the first one.

10:36.565 --> 10:38.509
Look it says wash on the dial.

10:40.293 --> 10:43.776
Okay, okay I can do this. I just turn it on and stick 'em.

10:44.133 --> 10:47.046
It's a washing maching, not a cocktail waitress.

10:48.905 --> 10:51.280
Let's start by separating her delicates.

10:52.513 --> 10:54.898
How is that not like a cocktail waitress?

10:57.067 --> 10:59.973
The reason you need to do these separately is 'cause they're mostly synthetic.

11:00.222 --> 11:04.263
Had a beat up civic and ex-husband and moved back to cocktail waitress.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.775
Charlie. Hand me the detergent.

11:08.094 --> 11:09.230
This stuff here?

11:09.784 --> 11:13.644
No, no. That's fabric softner. You put that in after the first rinse cycle.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.774
You know what, maybe I'll just buy her some new clothes.

11:20.408 --> 11:22.239
Don't be such a baby.

11:22.408 --> 11:25.065
Deterget. See...

11:25.593 --> 11:27.040
Go...

11:28.353 --> 11:32.993
Cold wash, cold rinse, gentle cycle...done.

11:34.589 --> 11:35.566
What's that?

11:37.680 --> 11:40.638
That would be water entering the washing machine.

11:41.943 --> 11:43.258
Amazing!

11:44.996 --> 11:47.165
Yeah, it's pretty cutting edge.

11:55.392 --> 11:56.950
Did I break it?

11:57.609 --> 11:59.017
Close the lid.

12:03.228 --> 12:05.346
Son of a gun!

12:18.078 --> 12:19.909
What will they think of next?

12:21.496 --> 12:24.238
Yeah, I hear scientists are working on a machine

12:24.239 --> 12:27.460
that can cook two pieces of bread, at the same time.

12:34.052 --> 12:35.958
Yeah yeah yeah. Very funny, now what?

12:35.959 --> 12:37.096
We wait.

12:38.082 --> 12:39.631
How will we know when they're done?

12:39.632 --> 12:42.514
Don't worry, the machine will call you on your cell phone.

12:43.603 --> 12:44.784
Really?

12:52.944 --> 12:55.855
I don't know what Berta is always complaining about, this is kinda fun!

12:55.856 --> 12:58.519
Yeah while you're dealing with pretty girl underwear

12:58.664 --> 13:02.364
Berta's gotta handle Jake's skinnies after P.E. and pudding pops.

13:03.181 --> 13:04.274
Good point.

13:05.584 --> 13:06.758
What are you doing?

13:07.124 --> 13:08.301
Pouring a glass of Vodka.

13:08.302 --> 13:11.221
Is that part of "doing the laundry"? 'Cause I can really get into this!

13:12.348 --> 13:14.141
No, I'm just mad at myself.

13:14.470 --> 13:16.019
Oh in that case pour me one.

13:16.819 --> 13:18.443
I'm mad at you too.

13:21.035 --> 13:22.030
What's the problem?

13:22.152 --> 13:23.692
I went over to Kandi's again.

13:24.058 --> 13:25.166
How did that go?

13:25.373 --> 13:27.410
Not only are we not selling the condo,

13:27.559 --> 13:30.340
I may have promised to buy her a new fridge.

13:30.341 --> 13:33.259
- Alan!
- She likes getting ice without having to open the door.

13:34.263 --> 13:36.057
You poor whip sap!

13:36.152 --> 13:37.767
Me? What about you?

13:37.955 --> 13:38.781
What about me?

13:38.782 --> 13:40.575
Charlie! You're doing a woman's laundry!

13:40.659 --> 13:42.913
No no no, no. See, that's just me trying to pitch in.

13:42.980 --> 13:45.638
Oh just face it, Lydia's got you wrapped around her little finger.

13:45.901 --> 13:47.224
Does not.

13:48.511 --> 13:50.192
She uses this one.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.572
And not so much wrapped as...

13:54.180 --> 13:55.090
...skewered.

13:57.626 --> 13:59.635
Who's using my washing machine?

13:59.785 --> 14:03.832
Excuse me, but it's my washing machine and I'm using it to wash Lydia's clothes.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.271
You're doing laundry?

14:05.272 --> 14:07.346
Hey! It's not rocket science.

14:07.647 --> 14:12.022
Cold wash, cold rinse, gentle cycle, but first...we separate the delicates.

14:12.107 --> 14:14.389
- Is that so?
- Yeah that's so.

14:16.673 --> 14:18.438
That's probably them now.

14:21.330 --> 14:22.297
Hello?

14:22.954 --> 14:25.916
Oh hey mom, I thought you were my washing machine.

14:36.762 --> 14:39.025
Oh come on! Throw the ball! Throw the ball!

14:40.462 --> 14:41.861
Or fall down.

14:44.349 --> 14:46.471
- Charlie I'm leaving.
- Bye!

14:49.385 --> 14:50.727
I'd like a kiss.

14:57.319 --> 14:58.718
She's still there isn't she?

15:00.416 --> 15:01.373
Yep.

15:02.418 --> 15:04.090
Just kidding sweetie.

15:04.193 --> 15:05.057
That's better.

15:05.817 --> 15:06.822
Good bye Jake.

15:07.414 --> 15:08.672
I'm not kissing you.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.134
Oh Charlie, I almost forgot.

15:11.135 --> 15:15.275
I'm serving hors d'oeuvres at an open house tomorrow so I'm gonna need to borrow Berta for a couple of hours.

15:15.276 --> 15:16.477
Say what?

15:17.453 --> 15:18.636
I'm talking to Charlie. 

15:18.957 --> 15:19.971
You don't mind do you?

15:20.807 --> 15:22.694
Mind, well I, uh...

15:22.695 --> 15:24.300
You wanna borrow me? 

15:24.647 --> 15:26.610
What am I, a carpet steamer?

15:27.672 --> 15:31.100
I'm not saying I won't pay you, plus you can take home all the leftovers.

15:31.137 --> 15:35.531
Oh gee, why don't you just toss 'em all in a big bowl and I'll eat 'em out in the yard.

15:35.841 --> 15:39.062
Well that's just a little uncalled for. I thought I was doing you a favor.

15:39.063 --> 15:43.828
You wanna do me a favor? You take the money that you were gonna pay me, convert it into rolls of nickels,

15:43.829 --> 15:44.814
then bend over -

15:44.815 --> 15:46.936
Berta, Berta, Berta...

15:50.599 --> 15:55.303
Well I don't have to stand here and listen to this. Charlie you have to make a decision, it's her...

15:55.876 --> 15:56.805
Or me.

15:57.363 --> 15:59.613
The skank's right Charlie.

16:00.714 --> 16:02.498
It's her or me.

16:04.891 --> 16:06.376
Great.

16:07.193 --> 16:08.958
That's just great.

16:10.084 --> 16:12.929
Did somebody say there was a big bowl of food?

16:18.619 --> 16:20.300
You got an offer on the condo?

16:20.741 --> 16:22.892
Oh oh mom, you're a life-saver!

16:23.305 --> 16:28.281
Uh, I don't care, I fully expect to take a loss. At least I don't have to pay you a commission!

16:28.901 --> 16:30.328
Oh come on you're my mother!

16:31.667 --> 16:33.930
What, wait, hang on mom I got another call coming.

16:34.315 --> 16:34.991
Hello?

16:35.376 --> 16:38.728
Oh oh Kandi, Kandi hello, listen. About the condo.

16:38.784 --> 16:41.057
My mom just got a very reasonable offer and -

16:42.584 --> 16:44.134
I give up, what are you wearing.

16:45.542 --> 16:46.397
Hang on.

16:46.669 --> 16:47.730
Mom I got to go.

16:47.927 --> 16:49.261
Kandi I'll be right there.

16:53.154 --> 16:54.882
Hey! Is Berta here?

16:55.032 --> 16:56.769
- I haven't seen her.
- Great.

16:57.257 --> 17:00.431
I have to admit Charlie, I never thought you had the cojones

17:00.562 --> 17:01.783
Are you kidding?

17:01.877 --> 17:04.214
I've got huge cojones.

17:04.635 --> 17:06.992
Why do you think I wear these baggy shorts?

17:10.006 --> 17:12.448
Wait, wait wait wait. You fired Berta?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.465
Yes Alan.

17:14.872 --> 17:17.387
She didn't know her place and she had to go.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.444
We can't live without Berta.

17:21.069 --> 17:22.299
I'll be right there sweetie.

17:25.691 --> 17:28.677
You know what? We need to work on our communication skills.

17:28.678 --> 17:30.763
You know I've always thought that, but I didn't think you'd be open -

17:30.764 --> 17:33.214
No no no you jackass!

17:34.444 --> 17:37.514
God you play along like a monkey with a mandolin!

17:39.047 --> 17:40.258
You mean you didn't fire Berta?

17:40.305 --> 17:42.192
That's it, give me the mandolin.

17:42.408 --> 17:44.615
But you promised Berta you'd get rid of Lydia.

17:45.169 --> 17:46.108
Alan

17:46.324 --> 17:47.356
you know what this is?

17:47.497 --> 17:49.723
- No.
- Then shut your stupid mouth.

17:50.884 --> 17:52.800
And don't tell Berta she was here.

17:52.997 --> 17:55.523
Fine. Just give me a heads up when you're lying.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.542
I'm always lying.

17:58.593 --> 18:00.631
I'll give you a heads up when I'm not.

18:00.822 --> 18:02.512
Yeah. You're the smart one!

18:02.690 --> 18:04.108
Know how I know?

18:04.174 --> 18:06.681
The washing machine called and told me.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.751
Oh, high heels and cool whip.

18:25.982 --> 18:28.855
Oh Charlie how could you?

18:29.212 --> 18:31.775
Berta, this is not what it looks like.

18:31.975 --> 18:33.841
Charlie you lied to me.

18:34.173 --> 18:37.018
Lydia, this is not what it looks like.

18:37.976 --> 18:40.521
- That's it, I'm out of here.
- Me too.

18:40.614 --> 18:41.751
Berta! Lydia!

18:41.752 --> 18:44.352
Oh come on wait! This is not what it looks like!

18:46.067 --> 18:50.020
Say it a few more times Charlie, maybe somebody will believe you.

18:54.735 --> 18:57.862
Berta! Berta, Berta, Berta! Wait wait wait wait, you can't quit.

18:57.863 --> 18:58.734
Why not?

18:58.735 --> 19:01.026
Because we're family! We love each other.

19:01.186 --> 19:03.064
We forgive each other, our shortcomings.

19:03.065 --> 19:04.437
Oh bite me.

19:04.728 --> 19:05.995
Don't go, don't go!

19:06.324 --> 19:08.202
I promise I'll break it off with her.

19:08.305 --> 19:10.437
No you won't, you want to know why?

19:10.653 --> 19:12.273
Because you are addicted to this broad.

19:12.274 --> 19:15.100
Oh that's ridiculous, I can stop anytime I want.

19:15.101 --> 19:16.292
No you can't.

19:16.452 --> 19:19.241
You're a nookie junkie and I just can't trust you anymore.

19:19.795 --> 19:22.909
No no no no, Wait! wait wait wait wait wait!

19:25.322 --> 19:26.326
You're right.

19:27.049 --> 19:28.430
I am addicted.

19:28.852 --> 19:32.458
I've got a vagina on my back, but I know I can get it off.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.390
I mean...you gotta help me.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.916
I can't help you pal, you gotta help yourself.

19:39.338 --> 19:40.380
Good bye Charlie.

19:40.381 --> 19:43.291
Oh come on Berta don't go, I'll do anything!

19:43.472 --> 19:44.740
I'm leaving now.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.345
You don't have to!

19:46.777 --> 19:48.646
I just fired her!

19:49.519 --> 19:50.937
Bye Charlie.

19:51.072 --> 19:54.237
Oh come on Lydia don't go, I'll do anything!

19:55.786 --> 19:56.622
You know what?

19:56.791 --> 19:58.518
I don't need either one of ya!

19:58.839 --> 20:02.501
I can do my own laundry and I got my own finger!

20:10.834 --> 20:12.111
I don't like it here.

20:12.496 --> 20:13.660
Well, tough.

20:13.829 --> 20:17.125
- This is the only way I can get Berta to come back.
- But why do I have to be here.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.685
'Cause it's the only way you're ever going to sell you're condo.

20:21.944 --> 20:24.056
Okay, let's get started.

20:24.648 --> 20:28.374
Welcome to our regular monday night meeting. Do we have any newcomers?

20:35.119 --> 20:39.957
My name is Charlie and uh...my maid say's I'm a sex addict.

20:51.337 --> 20:55.629
Uh, hi, I'm Alan, and...

20:56.326 --> 20:58.964
I have a lovely condo for sale.

21:01.287 --> 21:03.433
And I'm a sex addict.

21:05.251 --> 21:07.589
It's priced to move.

21:12.259 --> 21:14.515
Hi, my name is Pam.

21:14.884 --> 21:16.660
