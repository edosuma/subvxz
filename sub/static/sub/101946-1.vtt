WEBVTT

01:24.985 --> 01:27.052
Let not your
heart be troubled.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.654
You believe in God.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.656
Believe also in me.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.897
I can't believe she's gone.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.365
I know.

02:48.903 --> 02:50.237
I don't know what to say.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.409
I mean, I know what I
wanna say, but I just-

02:56.044 --> 02:58.413
- It's okay, you don't
have to say anything.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.921
It's just gonna
be a lotta work.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.255
You mean the ranch?

03:10.257 --> 03:11.691
Should I even go back?

03:11.693 --> 03:13.025
Lizzy, what are
you talking about?

03:13.027 --> 03:15.260
You love that place, okay?

03:15.262 --> 03:16.698
She gave it to you.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.232
She left it for you.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.867
Okay, so don't make any
decisions right now.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.202
Just stay there
for a couple days

03:24.204 --> 03:25.540
and see how you feel, okay?

03:27.442 --> 03:30.409
I've just never been there
for one single day by myself.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.578
And now I'm the only one left

03:32.580 --> 03:34.547
and I'm gonna have to figure

03:34.549 --> 03:36.549
out how to take care of
the ranch by myself and-

03:36.551 --> 03:38.216
- Hey, hey, hey, you're
working yourself up.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.285
Okay, look, you're very smart.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.587
You know that.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.024
Your grandmother knew that.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.025
You're gonna make
the right decisions.

03:46.027 --> 03:47.258
Just for right now,

03:47.260 --> 03:49.864
let's just take it one
day at a time, okay?

03:51.131 --> 03:52.297
Okay.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.038
Besides you have me
here whenever you need me

04:00.975 --> 04:03.643
Grandma said
anything worth having

04:03.645 --> 04:04.879
wasn't gonna be easy.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.086
Let's go.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.488
Hey, Hope.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.591
Yeah, there you go.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.196
I got one for you too.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.474
Hey.

05:13.181 --> 05:14.345
Legacy's so pretty.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.416
Yeah, and she's bigger
than Hope already.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.853
Yeah, I guess she is.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.564
I want to enter

05:31.566 --> 05:33.199
the Midstate Happy Valley
Saddlery Event Series.

05:33.201 --> 05:35.735
It's three events,
dressage, cross-country,

05:35.737 --> 05:36.571
and show jumping.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.405
You wanna do all those?

05:39.407 --> 05:42.708
Yeah, I mean, I was
competing before college,

05:42.710 --> 05:43.909
although it's been a while

05:43.911 --> 05:45.713
since I've done some
serious training.

05:47.148 --> 05:49.083
I don't even remember the
last time I took Legacy out.

05:50.218 --> 05:52.651
Be a lot easier if Hope
could still compete.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.554
Well, I think Legacy's
just as good as Hope.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.556
And I know you believe that too.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.091
I mean, I want to do this.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.326
I know I do, because if I'm
gonna be here at the ranch,

06:01.328 --> 06:02.762
then I need to be riding.

06:02.764 --> 06:05.097
And if I'm good, then maybe
we can get some students

06:05.099 --> 06:07.099
and some horses
to train and sell.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.267
Plus like with these events,

06:09.269 --> 06:12.173
I think they win like
$5,000 or something.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.509
Then what's the problem?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.777
No, I'm just wishing I'd
actually done some training

06:17.779 --> 06:21.046
in college instead of
just focusing on classes

06:21.048 --> 06:22.448
and my social life.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.250
It'd be way less daunting.

06:24.252 --> 06:26.452
Okay, it's gonna
be a lotta work

06:26.454 --> 06:28.187
and you shouldn't
worry about that

06:28.189 --> 06:30.355
because I've seen you and Legacy

06:30.357 --> 06:32.059
and you guys could
be unstoppable.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.427
I mean, I feel like
I'm back at square one,

06:35.429 --> 06:37.763
but I'm on my own.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.031
Okay, hold on a minute.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.433
First of all, you're
not on your own.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.301
You have me here with you.

06:43.303 --> 06:46.472
And secondly, you're
not at square one.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.240
You know how to ride,

06:48.242 --> 06:51.579
you know how to compete, and
I know you know you're good.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.886
So where do you
want these bowls?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.588
Right here again?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.422
- Do you want 'em up here?
- Yeah.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.258
Shall I?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.992
You got mad at me last
time I put them here.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.296
Stop, just stop.

07:09.797 --> 07:10.832
Well, once I, yeah-

07:21.409 --> 07:23.845
Hi, I'm Hailey and
this is my glam-mother.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.344
Hi.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.613
Hi, nice to meet you.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.814
We were at the
funeral with you,

07:28.816 --> 07:32.017
but you were, you
know, naturally upset.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.686
I just didn't feel
it was the right time

07:33.688 --> 07:34.755
to introduce myself.

07:36.757 --> 07:37.756
Do you guys wanna come in?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.191
Sure, thank you.

07:39.193 --> 07:40.626
Who's this?

07:40.628 --> 07:43.429
Oh, this is Queen
Charlize de la Pusa Soliel

07:43.431 --> 07:45.331
but you can call her Charlizey.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.167
Okay.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.040
I love your grandma.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.712
Yeah, we were really
tight, you know?

07:59.146 --> 08:03.449
Actually I moved away and I
just came back for the funeral

08:03.451 --> 08:04.750
and we're here now

08:04.752 --> 08:06.652
because we thought you
might need some help.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.954
I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to be rude

08:08.956 --> 08:13.492
but I don't really know
how you guys could help me.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.894
Well, you just never know
what comes up, you know?

08:14.896 --> 08:16.564
It's nice to have
someone around.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.731
I could make you a cup of tea.

08:18.733 --> 08:20.199
How would that help?

08:20.201 --> 08:21.700
Sure.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.568
She's potty trained.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.136
Okay, if I put her down?

08:24.138 --> 08:24.970
Yeah.

08:24.972 --> 08:25.905
Yeah?

08:25.907 --> 08:27.406
Of course.

08:27.408 --> 08:31.212
I mean, there's something
that I'm seeing in your eyes,

08:32.679 --> 08:37.149
it's so strange because
it kinda reminds me of me

08:37.150 --> 08:38.450
when I was younger.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.552
What kinda tea do you want?

08:40.554 --> 08:41.754
Green works.

08:41.756 --> 08:44.191
Oh, look,
it's still here.

08:49.497 --> 08:51.163
Do you know
anything about horses?

08:51.165 --> 08:52.665
A little.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.267
See, I'm thinking about
getting back into eventing.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.870
I've been away at school
for the past couple years

08:57.872 --> 08:59.571
so I haven't been here very much

08:59.573 --> 09:02.777
but when grandma
left me the place,

09:04.445 --> 09:05.945
instead of looking
for a real job,

09:05.947 --> 09:07.680
I've just been thinking
about riding all the time.

09:07.682 --> 09:10.249
Sometimes it's good to
do what you think about.

09:10.251 --> 09:13.052
They have eventing shows
around here all the time.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.954
I always go and see them.

09:14.956 --> 09:15.790
Do you ride?

09:17.124 --> 09:18.726
No, Charlizey, don't do that!

09:38.312 --> 09:40.214
Yes, good job, Lizzy!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.585
Lizzy, You guys look
great out there.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.421
I know, she's made for this.

09:48.423 --> 09:50.089
Oh man, it's gonna be different,

09:50.091 --> 09:52.491
but I know that if
I give her my time,

09:52.493 --> 09:55.094
we're totally gonna be
ready for the next event.

09:55.096 --> 09:57.496
You know, I was
thinking it's not too long

09:57.498 --> 10:00.332
before the next round of
competition start back up.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.600
We could just wait until then.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.169
What, no, I mean, did
you see us out there?

10:04.171 --> 10:07.906
When we're together,
everything just changes.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.844
I don't know, I just-

10:12.246 --> 10:15.415
I always thought I was gonna
be at some boring regular job,

10:15.417 --> 10:18.283
but this just feels so right.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.119
I know we can win this one.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.653
Yeah, well, I
was just thinking

10:21.655 --> 10:24.323
you know, it's not just about
you guys being great together.

10:24.325 --> 10:26.959
You know, Legacy's still
gotta learn some technique

10:26.961 --> 10:30.197
in the jumping and we just
need a little more time.

10:31.032 --> 10:32.197
Yeah, I know.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.034
But-

10:35.870 --> 10:37.536
You don't have to sound
so disappointed in me.

10:37.538 --> 10:39.439
Oh, I'm not disappointed.

10:39.441 --> 10:41.306
I'm just thinking
that, you know,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.175
I don't want you pushing
yourself too hard.

10:43.177 --> 10:44.877
Don't worry, I won't.

10:44.879 --> 10:45.713
I mean...

10:48.450 --> 10:53.387
Look, well, looks like I
can't do anything anyways.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.888
All this stuff's falling apart.

10:55.890 --> 10:58.959
Reins, gotta get a
new saddle and...

11:00.861 --> 11:02.361
It's a sign, I guess.

11:02.363 --> 11:03.896
You're right.

11:03.898 --> 11:06.533
Well, if you really wanna do
it, we can just get new ones.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.067
I can't be spending
money on all this stuff.

11:08.069 --> 11:11.637
I mean it's expensive and I
gotta take care of the ranch.

11:11.639 --> 11:15.076
Yeah, well that's
never stopped us before.

11:16.644 --> 11:18.844
We can get whatever
we put our minds to.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.581
I mean, what am I
even doing here, James?

11:22.583 --> 11:25.086
I thought I'd just put
all this stuff behind me.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.688
Come on, let's go.

11:41.769 --> 11:42.603
Okay.

11:57.351 --> 11:58.817
Hi.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.353
I am looking for somebody
completely different.

12:01.355 --> 12:02.522
I'm so sorry.

12:02.524 --> 12:03.891
Wait, you're Lizzy, right?

12:05.059 --> 12:08.026
Yeah, I don't think
we've met before.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.063
I'm Hailey's mother.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.072
Linda?

12:20.074 --> 12:22.475
Hi, oh, come on
in, grab a seat.

12:22.477 --> 12:24.710
What a happy surprise.

12:24.712 --> 12:25.813
Yeah, what's going on?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.314
You knew my grandma and
you knew she kept horses.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.583
Well, I have this horse.

12:30.585 --> 12:31.783
Her name's Legacy
and she's amazing.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.918
And she wants to do eventing.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.819
I just know she does.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.887
And I know she's gonna be great

12:34.889 --> 12:35.821
and I wanna do it with her,

12:35.823 --> 12:37.990
but my saddles and my reins,

12:37.992 --> 12:39.224
they're all old
and falling apart.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.095
So I was wondering if
you could just help me.

12:42.163 --> 12:42.997
Sorry.

12:44.665 --> 12:45.731
That's all right.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.666
I was gonna pay you a visit you.

12:47.668 --> 12:49.502
You beat me to it.

12:49.504 --> 12:50.337
Oh.

12:51.305 --> 12:52.804
You got a great place here.

12:52.806 --> 12:56.175
I mean all these ribbons and
trophies, are they all yours?

12:56.177 --> 12:57.743
All mine.

12:57.745 --> 13:01.013
Wow, I used to dream about
decorating my room like this

13:01.015 --> 13:03.083
but I never
envisioned this many.

13:04.519 --> 13:07.154
Back then, I was riding just
a little bit older than you.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.622
I was considered an
upper level rider.

13:09.624 --> 13:11.757
Yeah, I can see that.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.493
So you paid me a visit.

13:13.495 --> 13:15.528
You need some gear.

13:15.530 --> 13:17.463
Why don't you just take a look
around your shoulder there

13:17.465 --> 13:18.299
in the corner.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.866
Wow.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.537
Go ahead and
take a closer look.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.674
What?

13:32.112 --> 13:33.011
Are you sure?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.980
Oh yeah, absolutely.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.449
You think Legacy will like them?

13:36.451 --> 13:38.150
Oh, I know, she'll love them.

13:38.152 --> 13:40.719
I mean, I could never
afford this kinda quality.

13:40.721 --> 13:42.888
I haven't even started paying
off my student loans yet.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.725
Here I am going into eventing.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.795
I just wanna do it
right, you know?

13:49.564 --> 13:52.397
But I don't think
I could pay you.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.902
You don't have to,
Lizzy, they're a gift.

13:56.370 --> 13:58.538
You have no idea
what this means to me.

13:58.540 --> 13:59.639
I think I do.

13:59.641 --> 14:00.906
I mean, look around.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.242
I understand what
all this is about.

14:03.244 --> 14:07.513
I do, you know, I just know
that if it's in your blood,

14:07.515 --> 14:09.250
there's nothing you
can do about it.

14:10.851 --> 14:11.950
Thank you.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.352
You're welcome.

14:13.354 --> 14:15.187
So do you have a trainer?

14:15.189 --> 14:16.255
No.

14:16.257 --> 14:17.724
Why?

14:17.726 --> 14:20.759
Because if you'd let
me, I'd like to help you.

14:22.096 --> 14:26.398
Yeah, you've got this
fire in your eyes.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.934
I haven't seen that
since I saw it in my own.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.868
Really?

14:29.870 --> 14:31.937
Yeah, it burns brightly.

14:31.939 --> 14:35.073
Look, it can't hurt to have
somebody in your corner.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.609
Someone there to get your back.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.578
Yeah, I love that.

14:38.580 --> 14:40.513
Then I'm gonna unpack
my bags and stay.

14:40.515 --> 14:41.748
Let's go to work.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.182
All right, so
where do we start?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.518
Follow me.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.351
Okay.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.862
You guys are really good.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.301
Well, we still got
a lotta work to do

15:25.392 --> 15:26.325
I love dressage.

15:26.327 --> 15:28.260
It's my favorite to watch.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.462
That's the part

15:29.464 --> 15:30.663
that I fear getting
wrong the most.

15:30.665 --> 15:31.897
Why?

15:31.899 --> 15:33.398
It's poetry in motion.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.435
I mean, I look into her eyes

15:35.437 --> 15:37.804
and can see what she's thinking.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.171
You know, I was there
and she was born.

15:39.173 --> 15:40.906
So it's like we're in sync.

15:40.908 --> 15:44.444
So if something goes wrong
out there, it's all my fault.

15:44.446 --> 15:46.313
So then
it should be easy.

15:47.649 --> 15:51.584
It requires a perfect
focus and there's no way

15:51.586 --> 15:54.489
to hide any mistake you
might make out there.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.591
You know you're better
at this than you think.

15:58.593 --> 15:59.694
Well, thanks.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.532
Go Legacy!

16:46.508 --> 16:48.073
Hey.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.843
Hey, what is all this?

16:50.845 --> 16:54.549
Just a little something
I made for the two of us.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.082
And the rose petals?

16:57.084 --> 16:58.551
Decoration.

16:58.553 --> 16:59.852
Do you like it?

16:59.854 --> 17:02.387
Yeah, I just feel a
little under dressed.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.592
Well, Lizzy
you're always beautiful.

17:07.862 --> 17:09.561
So did you make all this?

17:09.564 --> 17:11.163
I did.

17:11.165 --> 17:13.330
When'd you
learn how to cook?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.335
I've picked up a
few things in my day.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.571
Lizzy, I've thought about
this a million different ways

17:19.574 --> 17:22.339
and I realized the
best way to do this is

17:22.342 --> 17:23.678
right here, right now.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.512
Lizzy Evans, will you marry me

17:27.515 --> 17:29.283
and make me the
happiest man alive?

17:30.951 --> 17:32.083
Yeah.

17:32.085 --> 17:32.919
Yeah?

17:32.921 --> 17:33.755
Yeah.

17:46.801 --> 17:47.633
I love you.

17:47.635 --> 17:48.969
I love you too.

17:51.806 --> 17:53.573
Oh, it's beautiful.

17:53.575 --> 17:54.642
Good job.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.643
That is just gorgeous.

17:57.645 --> 18:00.111
James, you did an amazing job.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.614
How sparkly.

18:01.616 --> 18:02.815
Congratulations.

18:02.817 --> 18:04.049
You take care of
my girl, all right.

18:04.051 --> 18:05.952
I will, yes sir.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.118
You knew?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.386
Yeah, he actually
came and asked

18:08.388 --> 18:09.822
for my permission,
if you believe it

18:09.824 --> 18:10.823
So cute.

18:10.825 --> 18:12.492
Was he nervous?

18:12.494 --> 18:13.325
Yeah.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.160
I raised him right.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.228
Yeah, that was no easy feat.

18:16.230 --> 18:17.663
He was so stubborn as a kid.

18:17.665 --> 18:20.833
I'm just glad he found somebody
who will put up with him.

18:20.835 --> 18:22.334
He asked permission,
like a gentlemen.

18:22.336 --> 18:23.603
I love that.

18:23.605 --> 18:26.572
I will say he is quite
the insistent young man.

18:26.574 --> 18:29.341
Almost felt like I had
to say yes or else.

18:29.343 --> 18:30.177
Stop it.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.578
But you wanted to, right?

18:32.580 --> 18:36.348
Yeah, we want you
guys to be happy.

18:36.350 --> 18:39.253
But we had reservations

18:40.588 --> 18:41.654
Reservations?

18:41.656 --> 18:43.689
We all had them, Lizzy.

18:43.691 --> 18:46.926
Yeah, I still can't
really believe it happened.

18:46.928 --> 18:47.860
I know.

18:47.862 --> 18:49.996
I'm in a state of shock myself

18:49.998 --> 18:52.264
But you're all
happy for us, right?

18:52.266 --> 18:55.200
I mean, we wanna share
our lives together

18:55.202 --> 18:57.369
and we can only really do
that by getting married.

18:57.371 --> 18:59.204
Sweetheart, of
course we are, but-

18:59.206 --> 19:00.873
- Why is there a but?

19:00.875 --> 19:02.875
Mom, you love everything
to do with weddings.

19:02.877 --> 19:04.877
You used to flip through
magazines with me,

19:04.879 --> 19:07.045
showing me what dress I
should wear for my wedding

19:07.047 --> 19:08.280
and now I'm getting married,

19:08.282 --> 19:10.115
there should be no buts.

19:10.117 --> 19:14.520
Listen we, we just
think that, well,

19:14.522 --> 19:15.655
you're a little too young.

19:15.657 --> 19:17.389
Too young, really?

19:17.391 --> 19:19.458
Lizzy, we think it too.

19:19.460 --> 19:22.227
I mean, you're still really
just a couple of kids.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.194
Of course we do.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.396
This is a really big deal.

19:24.398 --> 19:26.866
You're talking about
a spring wedding.

19:26.868 --> 19:29.502
But I think that's just taking
things a little too quickly.

19:29.504 --> 19:30.736
That's for sure.

19:30.738 --> 19:32.405
And Lizzy, you just
finished college.

19:32.407 --> 19:33.739
Yeah, maybe put on the brakes.

19:33.741 --> 19:35.307
I mean, what's another year?

19:35.309 --> 19:36.844
Well, we're not kids anymore.

19:38.012 --> 19:39.845
We know what we want and
we wanna be together.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.648
We're just asking you guys
to be a part of our future.

19:42.650 --> 19:44.384
We just hope you
can agree to that.

19:48.423 --> 19:49.323
Please.

19:50.491 --> 19:52.558
Okay, I don't wanna
argue with you guys.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.093
Can we just not talk
about this right now?

19:55.095 --> 19:57.863
We just want you two to
take a little more time.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.599
Like give it a year.

19:59.601 --> 20:01.434
That's not so long, is it?

20:01.436 --> 20:02.668
Dad?

20:02.670 --> 20:04.503
You guys are still very young.

20:04.505 --> 20:06.706
You've got so much
growing up to do.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.774
Marriage is a big step.

20:08.776 --> 20:10.409
It's a lifelong commitment.

20:10.411 --> 20:11.711
And I understand that.

20:11.713 --> 20:13.244
I do.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.347
You don't have
to get married now.

20:15.349 --> 20:16.616
I mean, what's the rush?

20:16.618 --> 20:18.084
What were you thinking?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.620
You guys are talking
like Lizzy and I just met,

20:20.622 --> 20:23.121
like, we've gone
through a big deal.

20:23.123 --> 20:24.289
I've given this
a lot of thought.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.958
I really have.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.894
It's gonna happen.

20:30.130 --> 20:32.898
There's nothing that's gonna
change your mind, is there?

20:32.900 --> 20:34.299
I'm happy.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.435
You guys can see that right?

20:36.437 --> 20:38.372
Couldn't you just
be happy for us?

20:51.318 --> 20:52.985
Proud of you.

20:52.987 --> 20:53.821
Thanks, Dad.

20:55.657 --> 20:56.722
You guys drive safe.

20:56.724 --> 20:57.992
All right, we'll see ya.

21:04.098 --> 21:06.599
You know, I'm not by myself.

21:06.601 --> 21:09.135
I've got plenty of
people to help me.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.469
I can do this.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.738
I'm not being self-righteous
when I say that

21:12.740 --> 21:15.841
I mean, I know I wasn't
the best kid growing up

21:15.843 --> 21:17.910
and I put you guys
through a lot,

21:17.912 --> 21:21.013
but you guys sent
me here to grow up.

21:21.015 --> 21:22.515
I can't leave this place now.

21:22.517 --> 21:25.453
I mean, Grandma left
it to me for a reason

21:26.688 --> 21:27.522
Honey.

21:29.624 --> 21:30.856
You know there is such a thing

21:30.858 --> 21:32.126
as biting off more
than you can chew?

21:33.828 --> 21:35.861
Lizzy, we're your parents.

21:35.863 --> 21:38.864
I'm not asking
for your permission.

21:38.866 --> 21:40.635
I'm just asking you to trust me.

21:41.703 --> 21:43.268
You can't talk me out of this.

21:43.270 --> 21:46.304
I know what I'm doing
here and with my life.

21:46.306 --> 21:51.311
So you can support me or you
can leave it's up to you.

22:22.076 --> 22:23.077
So when did you know?

22:24.011 --> 22:25.243
Know what?

22:25.245 --> 22:27.680
When did you know
you wanted to marry me?

22:27.682 --> 22:30.082
Well, the first
minute I saw you,

22:30.084 --> 22:31.552
it's just a matter of timing.

22:32.987 --> 22:33.821
You're cute.

22:35.089 --> 22:36.758
I like it when
you're being cute.

22:39.160 --> 22:39.994
What's wrong?

22:41.929 --> 22:43.996
Bad time with my parents,

22:43.998 --> 22:47.332
but talking to them,
maybe they were right.

22:47.334 --> 22:50.503
I mean, I'm going to be really
busy with all this eventing

22:50.505 --> 22:54.106
and figuring out how
to take the ranch,

22:54.108 --> 22:55.608
take care of the
ranch on my own.

22:55.610 --> 22:58.012
You know, maybe we should
put it off another year.

22:59.514 --> 23:01.781
I'm really surprised that
you're the one saying this.

23:01.783 --> 23:04.282
I mean, shouldn't we
put the brakes on it?

23:04.284 --> 23:06.051
I don't think
we should at all.

23:06.053 --> 23:07.553
Doesn't this feel right to you?

23:07.555 --> 23:09.789
We're not going to see very
much of each other at all.

23:09.791 --> 23:11.056
I've seriously gotta train

23:11.058 --> 23:14.059
if I wanna get Legacy
competition ready

23:14.061 --> 23:17.463
and taking care of this ranch.

23:17.465 --> 23:18.363
I mean, you get to go home.

23:18.365 --> 23:19.297
I have to stay here.

23:19.299 --> 23:21.267
Okay, I understand that.

23:21.269 --> 23:25.139
And I know that, but I
know that I also love you

23:26.574 --> 23:29.110
and I will be here with you
as much as I possibly can.

23:30.578 --> 23:34.649
And then once we get married,
my home will be here with you.

23:37.552 --> 23:39.752
We're really gettin'
married, aren't we?

23:39.754 --> 23:41.053
There's no other
way around it.

23:41.055 --> 23:41.989
It's gonna happen.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.322
Even our parents are-

23:44.324 --> 23:46.492
- Hey, we will show them.

23:46.494 --> 23:49.995
We belong together, okay?

23:49.997 --> 23:53.065
And it's gonna be hard work,

23:53.067 --> 23:55.937
but I know that you're
not afraid of hard work.

23:56.904 --> 23:58.637
And what about you?

23:58.639 --> 24:00.739
Me, I'm not too
partial to hard work,

24:00.741 --> 24:03.511
but for you, you
know, I can try it.

24:08.783 --> 24:09.784
What are you doing?

24:11.252 --> 24:15.521
I forgot to play this when I
first proposed to you, but...

24:20.761 --> 24:21.596
What?

25:00.334 --> 25:01.569
You go, girl.

25:06.407 --> 25:08.908
first
event of the season!

25:08.910 --> 25:11.076
Yeah, dressage.

25:11.078 --> 25:13.078
I haven't actually done
this with Legacy before,

25:13.080 --> 25:14.647
so I'm a little
nervous about it.

25:14.649 --> 25:16.081
Oh, you'll be great.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.183
I mean, cross country,
I'm looking forward to

25:18.185 --> 25:20.755
but then there's show jumping
and I'm nervous again.

25:22.823 --> 25:24.056
I know Legacy is gonna be great

25:24.058 --> 25:27.526
but I'm not so
sure about myself.

25:27.528 --> 25:28.928
You need to stop thinking

25:28.930 --> 25:30.765
about the things
you're worried about.

25:31.999 --> 25:33.232
Right answer.

25:33.234 --> 25:34.366
Okay, I wanna
see you in action.

25:34.368 --> 25:37.369
Oh, well, I am a little rusty,

25:37.371 --> 25:41.106
so please not judge me too hard.

25:41.108 --> 25:42.777
Why don't you
like showjumping?

25:43.878 --> 25:45.878
It's not that I don't like it.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.613
It's just that it's a lot.

25:47.615 --> 25:50.849
I have to get Legacy over
these really high jumps

25:50.851 --> 25:52.117
and it's all timed,

25:52.119 --> 25:53.786
so I have to keep
going constantly.

25:53.788 --> 25:56.622
And if I make a mistake, that
adds penalties onto our score

25:56.624 --> 25:58.457
and that stuff we can't afford.

25:58.459 --> 26:00.793
And then the more we do
it, the more tired we get

26:00.795 --> 26:03.228
and the more penalties add up.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.297
And it's just this
vicious cycle and-

26:05.299 --> 26:07.633
- Why are you thinking
about mistakes

26:07.635 --> 26:08.934
that you haven't made yet?

26:08.936 --> 26:11.070
I mean, and you're not
going to make them,

26:11.072 --> 26:13.406
but you're gearing
up against yourself

26:13.408 --> 26:14.640
before you even get
out there, babe.

26:14.642 --> 26:16.642
I have to think
about everything.

26:16.644 --> 26:19.545
I mean, it's all up to me and
it's right around the corner.

26:19.547 --> 26:22.147
You got one thing to
think about, right now,

26:22.149 --> 26:24.650
one thing, your
relationship to Legacy.

26:24.652 --> 26:25.486
That's it.

26:26.921 --> 26:28.487
Yeah, we have been
through a lot together.

26:28.489 --> 26:30.758
And you have something
so special together.

26:31.792 --> 26:33.726
Never give up on yourself, okay?

26:33.728 --> 26:35.327
Just remember why,

26:35.329 --> 26:36.465
why are you competing?

26:37.832 --> 26:38.664
Let's go.

26:38.666 --> 26:39.999
Let's go have a party.

26:40.001 --> 26:40.833
Come on.

27:02.089 --> 27:05.657
All right, you
wanna tie that one off?

27:17.972 --> 27:20.639
Hey, you're new here right?

27:20.641 --> 27:21.807
Yeah, I am.

27:21.809 --> 27:23.642
Oh, that's wonderful.

27:23.644 --> 27:26.378
You know if you
don't mind me saying,

27:26.380 --> 27:29.451
your horse looks a
little out of shape.

27:31.986 --> 27:34.553
We haven't been
training very long so.

27:34.555 --> 27:37.222
You know, I really
wouldn't dream of competing

27:37.224 --> 27:39.492
with an inexperienced horse.

27:39.494 --> 27:42.795
I trained for mine
for like two years

27:42.797 --> 27:46.732
before even thinking about
stepping into an events space.

27:46.734 --> 27:49.303
Well, she's a lot more
fit than you think she is.

27:50.571 --> 27:52.905
I don't think
you should be here.

27:52.907 --> 27:54.407
You're gonna get
in everyone's way.

27:54.409 --> 27:58.913
And you know, everybody here
is really serious about this.

28:00.081 --> 28:02.181
Do you even know
what dressage is.

28:02.183 --> 28:03.418
I do actually.

31:24.586 --> 31:25.784
You did it!

31:25.786 --> 31:28.053
Yay, I am so proud of you!

31:28.055 --> 31:28.887
For what?

31:28.889 --> 31:29.921
For what?

31:29.923 --> 31:30.757
I messed up.

31:30.759 --> 31:31.957
Oh, so what?

31:31.959 --> 31:33.091
You've got two
more competitions.

31:33.093 --> 31:34.527
- This was your first.
- Yeah, but-

31:34.529 --> 31:36.962
- You set out to do
something and you did it.

31:36.964 --> 31:38.731
That's something to be proud of.

31:38.733 --> 31:39.798
Why do I feel like this?

31:39.800 --> 31:42.301
I feel like I
shouldn't even be here.

31:42.303 --> 31:43.638
Okay, then let's go home.

31:46.608 --> 31:48.974
You wanna go out and give
this the best you got?

31:48.976 --> 31:50.108
Then that's all I wanna hear.

31:50.110 --> 31:51.577
I want you to focus.

31:51.579 --> 31:52.745
Want you to do it.

31:52.747 --> 31:53.481
That's it.

31:55.149 --> 31:56.982
Those other girls though.

31:56.984 --> 31:57.816
There's this one.

31:57.818 --> 31:58.620
She was just-

32:01.322 --> 32:02.821
- She was just what?

32:02.823 --> 32:04.657
She was saying
things, you know,

32:04.659 --> 32:06.391
like making fun of Legacy.

32:06.393 --> 32:11.129
I wanna do this, but I also
wanna make Legacy look good.

32:11.131 --> 32:12.898
Legacy looks good.

32:12.900 --> 32:15.233
You just think about the
relationship you have

32:15.235 --> 32:16.335
with that horse.

32:16.337 --> 32:17.503
Forget about the laughter.

32:17.505 --> 32:18.671
Forget about the girls.

32:18.673 --> 32:20.138
Forget about all of it.

32:20.140 --> 32:23.678
Just focus on the now and
what you're doing now.

32:27.649 --> 32:28.681
Huh?

32:28.683 --> 32:29.682
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:29.684 --> 32:30.949
- We'll stay and do this?
- Yeah.

32:30.951 --> 32:31.820
Okay, let's go.

32:34.054 --> 32:36.522
Lizzy, you guys looked
so great out there.

32:36.524 --> 32:38.926
I didn't know Legacy was
such an awesome dancer.

32:40.094 --> 32:44.497
Well, yeah I still
messed up though.

32:44.499 --> 32:46.532
No, no, you didn't.

32:46.534 --> 32:48.801
Look you haven't been
going at it for too long

32:48.803 --> 32:51.804
but look you put your
mind to something

32:51.806 --> 32:53.706
and you're actually doing it.

32:53.708 --> 32:54.841
I guess I just
feel like I rushed

32:54.843 --> 32:56.942
into everything, you know?

32:56.944 --> 32:58.845
I think I should've
waited like you said.

32:58.847 --> 33:00.045
James?

33:00.047 --> 33:01.146
Hey, no way.

33:01.148 --> 33:02.314
You know her?

33:02.316 --> 33:04.149
James, I can't
believe it's really you.

33:04.151 --> 33:05.718
It's me.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.721
So how's life
been since school?

33:08.723 --> 33:10.322
Really crazy.

33:10.324 --> 33:14.226
Crazy, like you just
got out of prison crazy

33:14.228 --> 33:16.128
or you're now a millionaire?

33:16.130 --> 33:18.566
Like engaged.

33:19.801 --> 33:22.702
Oh, you're the one
with the new horse.

33:22.704 --> 33:24.336
Dressage is hard, isn't it?

33:24.338 --> 33:26.873
Especially when your horse
has a mind of its own.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.207
Well, I'm the one
who messed up so.

33:29.209 --> 33:32.310
Well, at least you
finished the performance.

33:32.312 --> 33:34.079
Managed to stay on the horse.

33:34.081 --> 33:35.717
That's what
people keep telling me.

33:37.050 --> 33:39.317
So marriage, I
can't believe it.

33:39.319 --> 33:41.021
You're still so young.

33:42.389 --> 33:45.493
Yeah, you actually sound
just like my parents right now.

33:46.428 --> 33:48.428
Well, congratulations.

33:48.430 --> 33:50.929
I know I could never
do something like that.

33:50.931 --> 33:53.098
I've just got too much going on.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.601
Eventing always takes up
so much time, you know?

33:55.603 --> 33:58.671
And I just have one eye

33:58.673 --> 34:01.006
on getting onto an
Olympic team one day.

34:01.008 --> 34:03.241
I couldn't even think
about anything else.

34:03.243 --> 34:05.845
Well, when you love something,
you can find the time.

34:05.847 --> 34:08.915
Well, marriage just,

34:08.917 --> 34:11.116
I never would have put you
down for something like that,

34:11.118 --> 34:13.418
but whatever makes you happy.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.620
Yeah.

34:14.621 --> 34:17.956
Oh, hey, why don't you
come to the wedding?

34:17.958 --> 34:19.226
I'll send you an invite.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.695
Well, if I can
spare an afternoon,

34:22.697 --> 34:25.465
I'll try but no promises.

34:25.467 --> 34:28.366
I have two more
days of competition

34:28.368 --> 34:30.101
and then I gotta watch the tapes

34:30.103 --> 34:33.539
and then I have another
event to prepare for.

34:33.541 --> 34:36.975
But you know, I get
very serious about this.

34:36.976 --> 34:39.244
It's really not a
place for amateurs.

34:39.246 --> 34:40.780
Yeah, no, I get that.

34:40.782 --> 34:42.313
Sure.

34:42.315 --> 34:45.085
But to tell you the truth, I
find weddings kind of boring.

34:46.654 --> 34:49.922
Well I'll sure see
you later James.

34:49.924 --> 34:52.391
And I'll see you at
the next competition.

34:53.795 --> 34:54.629
See ya.

35:04.004 --> 35:09.009
So, that girl, you guys
seem pretty friendly.

35:10.177 --> 35:11.644
I've never heard you
mention her before.

35:11.646 --> 35:13.446
What's the matter,
you don't like her?

35:13.448 --> 35:15.515
You heard what she
said about Legacy.

35:15.517 --> 35:18.518
I didn't, but yeah,
we're good friends.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.520
I mean, we went to the
same high school together.

35:20.522 --> 35:21.988
Took a lotta the same classes.

35:21.990 --> 35:24.024
So that's it, you're
just good friends?

35:25.860 --> 35:27.960
I promise, I
wouldn't lie to you.

35:27.962 --> 35:29.027
I can't.

35:29.029 --> 35:29.864
Good.

35:32.032 --> 35:33.033
What's the matter?

35:34.034 --> 35:35.001
I don't know.

35:35.003 --> 35:36.167
You were just acting weird.

35:36.169 --> 35:39.373
I mean, I know you
James, and that was new.

35:40.307 --> 35:42.307
Acting like what?

35:42.309 --> 35:44.777
Like you were
trying to impress her

35:44.779 --> 35:46.146
or show off or something.

35:48.215 --> 35:49.482
You don't have to be jealous.

35:49.484 --> 35:50.716
Don't I?

35:50.718 --> 35:52.286
No, I asked you to
marry me, remember?

35:53.555 --> 35:55.023
You got nothing to worry about.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.058
Promise?

35:59.894 --> 36:01.393
I promise.

36:01.395 --> 36:03.731
But there is something else
you should worry about.

36:04.699 --> 36:05.965
What?

36:05.967 --> 36:07.466
How we're gonna
plan this wedding.

36:07.468 --> 36:08.701
That's what I
have to worry about?

36:08.703 --> 36:10.070
Oh yeah, it's
gotta be perfect.

36:12.339 --> 36:13.171
Cool.

36:13.173 --> 36:14.072
Good.

36:14.074 --> 36:15.242
Let's go wedding planning.

36:29.857 --> 36:31.156
It's so beautiful in here.

36:31.158 --> 36:32.425
It is.

36:32.427 --> 36:33.826
Let's take a seat.

36:33.828 --> 36:34.662
Let's talk.

36:41.736 --> 36:44.505
To see two young people
wanting to get married

36:45.740 --> 36:48.608
in love and loving the Lord.

36:48.610 --> 36:50.275
I happy for you both.

36:50.277 --> 36:51.911
At least you're happy for us.

36:51.913 --> 36:53.615
I don't know if our parents are.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.882
Your parents are aware that
you wanna get married right?

36:56.884 --> 36:58.249
Yes, of course.

36:58.251 --> 37:01.152
He asked my parents
permission before he asked me

37:01.154 --> 37:03.089
James, I'm proud of you.

37:03.091 --> 37:04.056
That takes courage.

37:04.058 --> 37:05.190
Thanks.

37:05.192 --> 37:06.626
I mean, they, they do support us

37:06.628 --> 37:10.228
and they will be here, but
they just think we're too young

37:10.230 --> 37:13.766
and maybe we haven't
thought this through enough.

37:13.768 --> 37:15.468
I've been married
for nine years.

37:15.470 --> 37:16.969
Marriage is tough.

37:16.971 --> 37:18.437
Marriage is also one

37:18.439 --> 37:20.575
of the most important
institutions in the world.

37:22.142 --> 37:25.444
It's not just about the beautiful
day, parties and gifts.

37:25.446 --> 37:26.779
And those are nice.

37:26.781 --> 37:28.380
That's one day,

37:28.382 --> 37:31.383
followed by a lifetime of
what will be hard work.

37:31.385 --> 37:33.788
We know that and
we're ready for it.

37:34.956 --> 37:37.957
Well, I've watched you
two mature and grow up

37:37.959 --> 37:40.793
and I'm proud of you and
I be honored to marry you.

37:40.795 --> 37:42.327
You're ready.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.429
Thank you, sir.

37:43.431 --> 37:44.262
I appreciate it.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.099
It means a lot.

37:55.443 --> 37:56.642
I've planned weddings

37:56.644 --> 37:58.010
for some of the most
demanding people

37:58.012 --> 38:00.178
to ever walk God's green earth.

38:00.180 --> 38:01.616
Then you are the guy for me

38:03.350 --> 38:04.917
From Eleven Courses Catering,

38:04.919 --> 38:07.287
world-renowned chef
at your disposal.

38:08.990 --> 38:10.355
I haven't thought
about the menu.

38:10.357 --> 38:12.692
Then we've got a lotta
work to do anything you want,

38:12.694 --> 38:14.660
we can do, wedding cakes too.

38:14.662 --> 38:16.327
You know, we work
with Kupcakes & Co.

38:16.329 --> 38:18.130
You design it and
we'll bring it to life.

38:18.132 --> 38:20.533
I do have a lotta
work cut out for me.

38:20.535 --> 38:21.500
Well, we're here to help.

38:21.502 --> 38:22.468
Just don't leave me hanging.

38:22.470 --> 38:24.202
We can't have guests go hungry.

38:24.204 --> 38:25.504
Not at a wedding.

38:25.506 --> 38:27.973
Hungry guests will
equal disaster.

38:27.975 --> 38:29.642
I do not want that.

38:29.644 --> 38:32.945
Listen, as long as you
don't become a bridezilla,

38:32.947 --> 38:34.714
we should get along just fine.

38:34.716 --> 38:35.648
Don't worry.

38:35.650 --> 38:37.516
I don't have any time for that.

38:37.518 --> 38:39.153
Oh, I've seen
it happen before.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.555
There was a sweet lady,
kindergarten teacher,

38:42.557 --> 38:43.624
everyone loved her

38:44.726 --> 38:46.692
until she didn't get
the flowers she wanted.

38:46.694 --> 38:47.895
She exploded.

38:49.897 --> 38:51.564
Wedding was called off.

38:51.566 --> 38:56.502
She lives alone in cave
somewhere now, all alone.

38:56.504 --> 38:59.071
I don't want that
to happen to you.

38:59.073 --> 39:00.473
I haven't thought
about flowers.

39:00.475 --> 39:01.308
Or the menu.

39:02.510 --> 39:03.409
You want perfection?

39:03.411 --> 39:04.677
I can give you perfection,

39:04.679 --> 39:06.512
but you're going to
have to work with me,

39:06.514 --> 39:08.581
especially if you want
to Palm Sunday wedding.

39:08.583 --> 39:09.815
Yeah.

39:09.817 --> 39:11.417
Anything you want,
name it, you got it.

39:11.419 --> 39:12.918
Commitment.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.286
That's a good thing to have
right before getting married.

39:15.288 --> 39:17.355
That's what I'm talking about.

39:17.357 --> 39:18.924
What else are
you talking about?

39:18.926 --> 39:20.661
Do you also want
a perfect wedding?

39:21.529 --> 39:23.361
Hey James.

39:23.363 --> 39:25.332
Bethany, hey, hi!

39:28.936 --> 39:31.271
I like how she acts like
she can't even see me.

39:41.449 --> 39:44.250
I can't wait to have a
horse of my own one day.

39:44.252 --> 39:45.951
I had that same dream
when I was your age.

39:45.953 --> 39:47.553
And it came true for you.

39:47.555 --> 39:49.255
Yeah, with Hope.

39:49.257 --> 39:50.725
It can come true for you too.

39:57.297 --> 40:01.033
So next event,
cross country, right?

40:01.035 --> 40:03.102
So you've seen all the girls
that you're competing against.

40:03.104 --> 40:04.737
How do you feel?

40:04.739 --> 40:09.241
Oh, well, I was confident,
but now I'm not so sure.

40:09.243 --> 40:11.143
I'm thinking maybe
throwing in the towel

40:11.145 --> 40:12.446
is the best way to go.

40:14.148 --> 40:16.381
Legacy wants to event.

40:16.383 --> 40:17.616
How do you know?

40:17.618 --> 40:19.317
When I was with
her, she told me

40:19.319 --> 40:20.452
- Really?
- There's no way

40:20.454 --> 40:21.720
I'm gonna let you not run.

40:21.722 --> 40:24.156
You're not gonna,
you're not gonna.

40:24.158 --> 40:25.724
I mean, I don't know.

40:25.726 --> 40:28.393
I just, it's been so long
since I've done any of this

40:28.395 --> 40:29.662
and I've got the
wedding going on.

40:29.664 --> 40:30.996
It's just a lot.

40:30.998 --> 40:32.832
We're not gonna do this.

40:32.834 --> 40:36.902
We're not, we're not gonna
have this conversation, okay?

40:36.904 --> 40:38.437
Would you be talking
to your grandmother

40:38.439 --> 40:40.172
if she was here
right now like this?

40:40.174 --> 40:42.109
No way, so don't do it to me.

40:43.811 --> 40:45.343
Okay.

40:45.345 --> 40:47.246
Well I guess I'm doing it.

40:47.248 --> 40:48.414
Yes.

40:48.416 --> 40:50.182
Yes, you can do it.

40:50.184 --> 40:52.852
Yeah, just gotta be better.

40:52.854 --> 40:54.088
You will be, baby.

40:55.189 --> 40:56.422
You really believe in me?

40:56.424 --> 40:57.489
- Of course.
- Yes.

40:57.491 --> 40:59.091
Next event competition.

40:59.093 --> 41:00.862
Let's go, you're
gonna be awesome.

41:02.029 --> 41:03.329
Let's do it.

41:03.331 --> 41:05.097
Let's do it.

41:10.271 --> 41:12.106
Go Lizzy, go Legacy!

41:14.308 --> 41:18.045
Come on, girlfriend
you can do this, do it!

41:19.213 --> 41:20.179
Yes, yes!

41:20.181 --> 41:22.316
Go Lizzy, go Legacy, yes!

41:24.051 --> 41:25.150
Legacy looked happy out there.

41:25.152 --> 41:26.785
Her eyes sparkled.

41:26.787 --> 41:28.020
You could see that?

41:28.022 --> 41:29.688
Of course, she
was happy excited,

41:29.690 --> 41:31.359
having the best
time of her life.

41:32.627 --> 41:33.959
Yeah.

41:33.961 --> 41:35.895
I was like that when
I first met her.

41:35.897 --> 41:38.297
It's like I looked into her eyes

41:38.299 --> 41:40.065
and I could see what
she was thinking

41:40.067 --> 41:42.470
and she could see what
I was thinking too.

41:43.704 --> 41:45.237
Can you still do that?

41:45.239 --> 41:46.906
I think so.

41:46.908 --> 41:48.474
So how'd you feel out there?

41:48.476 --> 41:49.308
It felt great.

41:49.310 --> 41:50.242
It was cross country.

41:50.244 --> 41:51.744
We were out there by ourselves.

41:51.746 --> 41:53.812
Cross country is
definitely our best phase.

41:53.814 --> 41:55.080
But you didn't feel

41:55.082 --> 41:56.649
like that when you
were doing dressage?

41:56.651 --> 41:59.818
No, Legacy definitely gets
her dancing skills from me.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.422
And I've got two left feet.

42:02.356 --> 42:03.522
You can't dance?

42:03.524 --> 42:06.258
No, I am the worst at dancing.

42:06.260 --> 42:08.360
My prom date had to be
taken away on a stretcher

42:08.362 --> 42:10.429
because I was stepping
on his feet too much.

42:10.431 --> 42:11.430
Come on!

42:11.432 --> 42:12.398
No, I mean, it's true.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.199
It's like my ears hear the music

42:14.201 --> 42:16.268
but my feet just
can't follow the beat.

42:16.270 --> 42:20.339
Okay, gotta put that last
competition behind you, right?

42:20.341 --> 42:21.740
Gotta focus on right now.

42:21.742 --> 42:23.609
What's happening now,

42:23.611 --> 42:25.244
start all over again, okay?

42:25.246 --> 42:26.280
You're gonna be great.

42:36.958 --> 42:37.959
Hey, big boy.

42:39.126 --> 42:40.728
Wanna grab one of those brushes?

42:41.796 --> 42:44.596
Yeah, hey buddy.

42:44.598 --> 42:45.866
Let's go over this way.

42:47.768 --> 42:48.867
Hi.

42:48.869 --> 42:49.702
Hi baby.

42:49.704 --> 42:51.404
Back up, back up.

42:51.406 --> 42:52.972
Good boy.

42:52.974 --> 42:55.076
I love watching the
two of you do this.

42:56.877 --> 42:59.578
You know, I have never
had a pet in my life.

42:59.580 --> 43:01.647
Not even a dog, not 'til Hope,

43:01.649 --> 43:03.148
and I had to learn
everything with him.

43:03.150 --> 43:05.284
His likes, his dislikes,

43:05.286 --> 43:06.618
and then when Legacy came along,

43:06.620 --> 43:08.921
it was the same
thing all over again

43:08.923 --> 43:11.392
Well, you're doing a good
job taking care of him.

43:13.828 --> 43:16.328
Have you ever been
married before Linda?

43:16.330 --> 43:17.796
I wonder where that came from

43:17.798 --> 43:20.332
because your big day is right
around the corner, right?

43:20.334 --> 43:21.166
Yeah.

43:21.168 --> 43:22.101
Yeah?

43:22.103 --> 43:23.235
Feeling a little nervous.

43:23.237 --> 43:25.504
Hailey, will you take over?

43:25.506 --> 43:26.572
Come with me.

43:29.243 --> 43:31.010
So what's going on?

43:31.012 --> 43:32.277
I don't know.

43:32.279 --> 43:35.448
I just been feeling
a little nervous,

43:35.450 --> 43:36.749
thinking about everything.

43:36.751 --> 43:38.517
You can always
change your mind.

43:38.519 --> 43:40.487
No, I'm being serious.

43:40.489 --> 43:43.155
Baby, marriage
is a serious thing

43:43.157 --> 43:44.156
you know, but I think
what you're going through

43:44.158 --> 43:47.494
is just feeling some cold feet.

43:47.496 --> 43:50.029
Don't worry about it,
it's a natural thing.

43:50.031 --> 43:53.466
And yes, yes I
have been married.

43:53.468 --> 43:58.473
He's not with us any longer,
but I had 25 years of bliss.

44:01.308 --> 44:03.878
You know, ups and
downs, but solid.

44:05.046 --> 44:07.112
He's been gone now
about five years

44:07.114 --> 44:09.948
and every day I wake
up expecting him

44:09.950 --> 44:11.518
to be somewhere in the house.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.818
I'm sorry.

44:12.820 --> 44:14.653
First 12 months after he died.

44:14.655 --> 44:19.224
I, every morning, I'd
check out every single room

44:19.226 --> 44:20.559
in the house because I thought

44:20.561 --> 44:21.693
maybe I'd better double check.

44:21.695 --> 44:23.064
Maybe he's hiding someplace.

44:24.466 --> 44:25.664
You know, after all these years

44:25.666 --> 44:29.902
I still remember the
moment that I said I do

44:29.904 --> 44:32.239
and that was even before
he asked me to marry him.

44:33.841 --> 44:35.574
Marriage is just something
pretty magical, isn't it?

44:35.576 --> 44:37.510
Oh baby, don't
ever underestimate

44:37.512 --> 44:42.517
the power of love when two
people come together like that.

44:43.851 --> 44:46.585
I don't, I guess
that's why it's so scary.

44:46.587 --> 44:50.089
But great things
are scary sometimes.

44:50.091 --> 44:53.894
That's why you just have to
make sure that you're sure.

44:55.430 --> 44:56.261
I'm sure.

44:56.263 --> 44:57.096
You're sure?

44:57.098 --> 44:58.330
Yeah.

44:58.332 --> 44:59.698
Then there's
nothing to worry about.

44:59.700 --> 45:00.701
Let's celebrate.

45:02.203 --> 45:03.035
Okay.

45:03.037 --> 45:04.504
You love James?

45:04.506 --> 45:08.575
I do more than I ever
thought I could love anyone.

45:08.577 --> 45:10.010
That's what makes it so scary.

45:11.245 --> 45:12.111
It's not scary.

45:12.113 --> 45:13.112
It's a good scary.

45:13.114 --> 45:14.613
Okay, let's back up.

45:21.622 --> 45:23.789
You know, you guys
coulda called us first.

45:23.791 --> 45:25.390
I know, sorry.

45:25.392 --> 45:27.793
It's okay, it's just
that with everything going

45:27.795 --> 45:32.064
on right now, unexpected visits
might not be the best idea.

45:32.066 --> 45:35.033
Well, we just wanted
to see you and talk.

45:35.035 --> 45:36.536
Yeah, you guys can
come over whenever.

45:36.538 --> 45:38.871
It's no big deal, really.

45:38.873 --> 45:42.276
First, we think
you guys are crazy.

45:44.245 --> 45:46.378
Look, I'm not here to fight.

45:46.380 --> 45:48.414
I am desperate to be
part of this wedding.

45:48.416 --> 45:50.082
Well, good.

45:50.084 --> 45:52.885
I just wanna say that
we're here to help,

45:52.887 --> 45:54.319
whatever you guys need,

45:54.321 --> 45:56.556
however we can help, just
name it and I'll do it

45:56.558 --> 45:58.123
just so I get to be there.

45:58.125 --> 45:59.324
Well, thanks mom.

45:59.326 --> 46:00.993
But Lizzy and I have
already got it sorted.

46:00.995 --> 46:02.828
We shouldn't have been
so against your decision.

46:02.830 --> 46:04.163
You're both adults.

46:04.165 --> 46:05.130
It's okay.

46:05.132 --> 46:06.999
It's not gonna be anything big.

46:07.001 --> 46:08.300
We're gonna keep it
small and simple.

46:08.302 --> 46:09.902
Yeah, it's nothing
too complicated.

46:09.904 --> 46:11.904
Well, it seems like lots of
people already know about it.

46:11.906 --> 46:13.439
I mean, Bethany
came by the house

46:13.441 --> 46:14.673
the other day looking for you.

46:14.675 --> 46:16.341
Yeah, I remember
you guys hanging out

46:16.343 --> 46:17.843
in high school all the time.

46:17.845 --> 46:20.981
We haven't seen her lately,
but I know you two were close.

46:23.350 --> 46:26.586
I don't think you can ask
her to be your best man,

46:26.588 --> 46:28.421
but I'm willing to do the job

46:28.423 --> 46:32.324
if I get to do a speech
using my dad jokes and all.

46:32.326 --> 46:34.161
I think we can consider that.

46:35.362 --> 46:38.297
Well, I've got
great new material.

46:38.299 --> 46:39.831
Mom loves it.

46:39.833 --> 46:42.201
- No, no.
- Yeah she does,

46:42.203 --> 46:43.368
she does.

46:43.370 --> 46:44.937
Well, he is-

46:44.939 --> 46:46.539
Losing weight,
been workin' out.

46:46.541 --> 46:47.607
But every
time he works out,

46:47.609 --> 46:50.209
he rewards himself with cake.

46:50.211 --> 46:51.810
Well, who's making the cake?

46:51.812 --> 46:54.313
You know your mom's
cakes are fabulous.

46:54.315 --> 46:56.516
Oh, maybe I can
make the wedding cake.

46:56.518 --> 46:58.217
I already have a caterer.

46:58.219 --> 46:59.384
Yeah.

46:59.386 --> 47:00.352
Yeah, it's gonna be good though.

47:00.354 --> 47:01.454
You guys are gonna love them.

47:01.456 --> 47:02.856
It's tastes great.

47:03.824 --> 47:04.892
Can I get an apple?

47:05.859 --> 47:06.695
I'm on a diet.

47:10.297 --> 47:11.564
Do you want one?

47:11.566 --> 47:13.165
No thank you.

47:19.507 --> 47:22.040
She's in first
place after dressage.

47:22.042 --> 47:23.909
I need to have a clean
run at cross country

47:23.911 --> 47:26.044
and show jumping to move ahead.

47:26.046 --> 47:27.246
You'll be fine, Lizzy.

47:27.248 --> 47:29.482
You just perform
like you practice.

47:29.484 --> 47:30.382
You'll be great.

47:30.384 --> 47:31.216
Yeah.

47:31.218 --> 47:32.052
Yeah.

47:33.421 --> 47:36.689
Well, you might be
nervous, but Legacy isn't.

47:36.691 --> 47:39.091
You just gotta have hope.

47:39.093 --> 47:42.430
Yeah, there's just a lot
more going on than that.

47:43.931 --> 47:46.398
Yeah, I mean you can just feel

47:46.400 --> 47:49.334
when somebody doesn't
like you, you know?

47:49.336 --> 47:51.270
I just wanna stop.

47:51.272 --> 47:54.576
I mean, I just, what is this?

47:55.577 --> 47:57.776
What's going on?

47:57.778 --> 47:59.044
What do you mean?

47:59.046 --> 48:00.245
What do I mean is
it's your turn soon!

48:00.247 --> 48:01.882
Get your head in the race.

48:03.284 --> 48:06.519
You said that the first time
you competed it was disastrous.

48:06.521 --> 48:08.956
Let's not have the second
time be that way too.

48:09.923 --> 48:10.725
Yeah.

48:11.593 --> 48:12.759
I'm trying.

48:12.761 --> 48:14.527
It doesn't sound
like that to me, Lizzy.

48:14.529 --> 48:15.728
It really doesn't.

48:15.730 --> 48:17.530
You've gotta get
your head straight.

48:17.532 --> 48:19.264
You've gotta start
thinking clear

48:19.266 --> 48:21.703
and you've got to focus, please.

48:22.737 --> 48:25.139
Yeah, focus.

48:27.041 --> 48:30.445
All right, well I guess I
gotta go saddle Legacy up.

48:32.246 --> 48:33.080
I'll focus.

48:39.086 --> 48:40.154
Back again?

48:41.388 --> 48:43.021
Yeah.

48:43.023 --> 48:45.324
You know, as the phases go on,

48:45.326 --> 48:47.059
it only gets harder.

48:47.061 --> 48:50.630
The mid-state eventing series
is not for the fainthearted.

48:50.632 --> 48:52.130
Well, I'm not going anywhere

48:52.132 --> 48:54.333
so we're gonna be seeing
a lot more of each other.

48:54.335 --> 48:55.169
Okay.

48:56.303 --> 48:57.637
Look, I know
you don't like me-

48:57.639 --> 48:59.505
- I don't know you.

48:59.507 --> 49:00.673
Then
why are you acting

49:00.675 --> 49:01.973
like I did something
to offend you.

49:01.975 --> 49:02.941
What is it that
you want from me?

49:02.943 --> 49:04.444
I don't want anything.

49:04.446 --> 49:06.446
I just don't understand why
you keep acting so rude to me

49:06.448 --> 49:07.580
when you don't even know me.

49:07.582 --> 49:08.416
I don't know.

49:10.017 --> 49:11.283
But I do know James.

49:11.285 --> 49:13.118
And what's that
supposed to mean?

49:13.120 --> 49:14.823
Your marriage
to him won't work.

49:16.223 --> 49:17.690
Why would you say
something like that?

49:17.692 --> 49:19.091
Because it's true.

49:19.093 --> 49:20.325
Well, you're wrong.

49:20.327 --> 49:21.828
No, I'm not.

49:21.830 --> 49:24.031
And you've also got no
chance at beating me.

49:24.865 --> 49:27.199
Your horse is untalented

49:27.201 --> 49:30.202
and she should be
left in a petting zoo,

49:30.204 --> 49:32.938
not in a competition.

49:32.940 --> 49:34.172
Well this just proves

49:34.174 --> 49:35.710
that you obviously
don't know anything.

49:36.845 --> 49:39.179
I certainly know
quite a bit about James.

49:40.147 --> 49:41.481
Feel kinda sorry for him.

49:41.483 --> 49:42.849
Well, you don't
know him like I do

49:42.851 --> 49:43.818
and you never will.

49:45.285 --> 49:47.555
Believe me, I know James
a lot better than you do.

49:49.022 --> 49:50.556
You're just jealous.

49:50.558 --> 49:52.059
That's what all this is about.

49:55.362 --> 49:57.697
See you out there.

49:57.699 --> 49:58.698
Good luck.

54:05.947 --> 54:07.381
I'm more than disappointed.

54:09.316 --> 54:10.150
I'm sorry.

54:11.218 --> 54:12.885
I felt good out there too.

54:12.887 --> 54:14.120
At least the first part

54:14.122 --> 54:15.423
You were doing so great.

54:16.289 --> 54:18.223
And you just lost your head.

54:18.225 --> 54:21.261
Right to the end and
then you just gave up.

54:22.930 --> 54:26.134
I had stand out there
and watch you fall apart.

54:27.969 --> 54:30.469
I tell ya, I'm ready to take
off because there's no point

54:30.471 --> 54:32.805
in my being here
to try and help you

54:32.807 --> 54:34.940
if you're not gonna go
the extra mile out there.

54:34.942 --> 54:37.443
Actually, it doesn't matter
who tries to help you

54:37.445 --> 54:39.847
if you're not gonna give
extra effort out there.

54:41.015 --> 54:43.918
Do you realize you were
this close to perfection

54:44.986 --> 54:46.184
and you let it all slip away

54:46.186 --> 54:48.754
because of some stupid rivalry.

54:48.756 --> 54:49.588
But-

54:49.590 --> 54:52.925
- No buts, no more buts.

54:52.927 --> 54:54.493
That girl is so jealous of you,

54:54.495 --> 54:57.663
she'll do anything she
can to get under your skin

54:57.665 --> 54:58.800
and you're allowing it.

54:59.867 --> 55:01.102
You're letting her do it.

55:02.269 --> 55:03.368
You don't think I
had things like that

55:03.370 --> 55:04.503
to face when I was riding?

55:04.505 --> 55:06.038
Of course I did.

55:06.040 --> 55:10.044
A lotta people do, but you've
got to learn to rise above it.

55:12.180 --> 55:14.281
I had to learn to deal
with it, so do you.

55:16.184 --> 55:17.885
Okay, let's get real.

55:24.224 --> 55:27.392
Is this really what you want?

55:27.394 --> 55:28.561
Yeah, I wanna finish it.

55:28.563 --> 55:30.696
I wanna do the
third competition.

55:30.698 --> 55:31.899
I'm gonna see it through.

55:33.067 --> 55:34.332
Let's see it.

55:40.842 --> 55:42.408
So where am I
supposed to go now?

55:42.410 --> 55:43.576
Get in, I'll drive you back.

55:43.578 --> 55:48.583
Okay.

55:59.494 --> 56:01.026
You were much
better up there today.

56:01.028 --> 56:02.163
Did you see your time?

56:05.566 --> 56:07.602
You were much better than I
thought you were gonna be.

56:08.903 --> 56:11.604
It's gonna make it
much more interesting.

56:11.606 --> 56:14.206
And here I was thinking
you were a joke rider.

56:14.208 --> 56:16.175
Look, I don't
wanna argue with you

56:16.177 --> 56:18.177
so can you just leave me alone?

56:18.179 --> 56:19.512
I'm not here to fight.

56:19.514 --> 56:20.446
I'm here to talk.

56:20.448 --> 56:21.680
We tried that already.

56:21.682 --> 56:23.281
Can't say anything
without insulting me,

56:23.283 --> 56:25.451
my fiance, or Legacy.

56:25.453 --> 56:26.452
There's one
person who left out

56:26.454 --> 56:27.686
of that little list of yours.

56:27.688 --> 56:28.921
Who?

56:28.923 --> 56:32.091
Linda, saw you
talking with her.

56:32.093 --> 56:33.692
She had a little girl.

56:33.694 --> 56:35.928
Yeah, that's
her granddaughter.

56:35.930 --> 56:38.197
How well do you
think you know her?

56:38.199 --> 56:39.632
Why?

56:39.634 --> 56:41.033
What's she doing with you?

56:41.035 --> 56:41.969
She's helping me.

56:43.638 --> 56:45.137
Is that why you were
so much better today?

56:45.139 --> 56:47.206
I mean, you were awful

56:47.208 --> 56:51.544
in the first competition,
but you did okay today.

56:51.546 --> 56:52.812
Suddenly Legacy isn't such

56:52.814 --> 56:54.980
a talentless horse
after all, is she?

56:54.982 --> 56:57.917
Says you, but I'm suspicious.

56:57.919 --> 56:59.253
Well, I beat you so.

57:02.456 --> 57:04.924
How much do you think
you know about Linda?

57:04.926 --> 57:06.158
Why do you keep
asking about her?

57:06.160 --> 57:08.794
Because I know
who she really is.

57:08.796 --> 57:11.764
So do a lotta people and
it seems like you don't.

57:11.766 --> 57:13.167
What do you wanna say now?

57:14.334 --> 57:16.602
Linda isn't who
you think she is.

57:16.604 --> 57:17.438
She's trouble.

57:18.573 --> 57:21.140
She shoulda kept
herself hidden away

57:21.142 --> 57:23.843
and if you know
what's good for you,

57:23.845 --> 57:25.277
you'll stay away from her.

57:25.279 --> 57:26.846
You just wanna insult
everyone in my life,

57:26.848 --> 57:28.346
is that it?

57:28.348 --> 57:30.348
You don't know anything
about her or anything else.

57:30.350 --> 57:32.985
You're just scared and jealous

57:32.987 --> 57:35.621
and people like you are
bitter and twisted inside.

57:35.623 --> 57:37.556
You're just wasting your
life being like this.

57:37.558 --> 57:39.091
Can't you see that?

57:39.093 --> 57:40.526
So just leave me alone.

57:40.528 --> 57:43.195
Why don't you do a little
bit of research on her

57:43.197 --> 57:45.132
before you go tell
me how wrong I am?

57:53.541 --> 57:55.708
Took it back
anyways, got it fixed

57:55.710 --> 57:56.942
so we're gonna have,
I think it's gonna be-

57:56.944 --> 57:59.612
- Hey James, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

57:59.614 --> 58:00.880
Bethany.

58:00.882 --> 58:03.282
We should totally go
for a coffee sometime.

58:03.284 --> 58:05.651
Actually, I was
looking for Lizzy.

58:05.653 --> 58:06.888
Did you see her anywhere?

58:08.055 --> 58:09.389
Why are you marrying her?

58:11.058 --> 58:12.558
What do you mean?

58:12.560 --> 58:14.126
I mean, shouldn't you like
be saying congratulations?

58:14.128 --> 58:17.630
No, not when I don't think
you're right for each other.

58:17.632 --> 58:20.799
Wow, I mean, you're
like the first person

58:20.801 --> 58:22.668
to actually say that.

58:22.670 --> 58:24.570
I'm just being honest.

58:24.572 --> 58:26.071
Well, to be honest,

58:26.073 --> 58:29.410
I'm kinda tired of everybody
questioning my decisions.

58:31.545 --> 58:34.413
I was really hoping
you'd be here today.

58:34.415 --> 58:35.414
I mean, of course
I would be here.

58:35.416 --> 58:37.383
I'm here to support Lizzy.

58:37.385 --> 58:38.317
Why wouldn't I be?

58:38.319 --> 58:39.852
That's not what I meant.

58:39.854 --> 58:44.759
Look, I really missed you and
I thought about you every day

58:45.693 --> 58:46.592
since high school

58:46.594 --> 58:48.761
Bethany, just stop, okay?

58:48.763 --> 58:51.096
Look, I
wrote you this letter

58:51.098 --> 58:53.267
and I need you to read it.

58:54.268 --> 58:56.368
What is this about?

58:56.370 --> 58:57.937
Did I never tell
you that I liked you?

58:57.939 --> 59:01.874
Bethany, I'm with
Lizzy now, okay?

59:01.876 --> 59:03.577
We've been through
a lot together.

59:04.779 --> 59:05.613
I'm sorry.

59:11.385 --> 59:14.722
Lizzy, hey, been looking
all over for you.

59:16.290 --> 59:20.192
Seems like you're
always talking to her.

59:20.194 --> 59:21.927
Those shared glances.

59:21.929 --> 59:23.631
What are you trying to say?

59:24.598 --> 59:26.198
Is there something going?

59:26.200 --> 59:27.434
With Bethany?

59:27.436 --> 59:28.701
No, no, no, no,
no, of course not.

59:28.703 --> 59:29.935
Don't even.

59:29.937 --> 59:31.303
You've got nothing
to worry about.

59:31.305 --> 59:32.638
Don't even think about Bethany.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.442
Well, she's my
number one competition

59:35.444 --> 59:38.913
so I have to beat
her if I want to win.

59:40.247 --> 59:41.747
Well, if she's your
number one competition

59:41.749 --> 59:44.383
what you need to do is focus.

59:44.385 --> 59:45.884
You need to not-

59:45.886 --> 59:48.287
Just get her outta your mind
and just focus on winning.

59:48.289 --> 59:50.289
That's what you gotta do.

59:50.291 --> 59:51.657
You can do this, okay?

59:51.659 --> 59:52.658
I believe in you.

59:52.660 --> 59:53.625
We're all here for you.

59:53.627 --> 59:54.463
You can beat her.

59:56.163 --> 59:57.264
Let's just go home.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.768
So much to plan.

01:00:35.536 --> 01:00:37.870
That's why you've got me here.

01:00:37.872 --> 01:00:39.171
Who woulda thought
picking out flowers

01:00:39.173 --> 01:00:40.839
would be this hard.

01:00:40.841 --> 01:00:42.708
Well, here's your
challenge for today.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.478
Not only do we need the
flowers nailed down,

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.879
we need the reception venue

01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:48.517
and everything
that goes with it.

01:00:51.052 --> 01:00:53.052
Oh, if you'd only given me
three things to focus on today,

01:00:53.054 --> 01:00:55.821
I would've struggled, but
you've given me hundreds.

01:00:55.823 --> 01:00:58.290
From Luis Matchicau fabrics

01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:00.327
to the Nouvelle and Fairwinds.

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.797
Well, you asked
for perfection.

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:07.566
Yeah, but at this rate,
it's just gonna be me standing

01:01:07.568 --> 01:01:08.834
in the middle of the field,

01:01:08.836 --> 01:01:12.237
with a white t-shirt
and jeans, nobody else.

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.806
That's as much as
I've got planned

01:01:13.808 --> 01:01:15.876
and the wedding's
right around the corner

01:01:18.045 --> 01:01:19.645
Don't have a meltdown on me.

01:01:19.647 --> 01:01:20.681
I'm trying.

01:01:22.484 --> 01:01:25.252
Meltdowns are messy and I
really don't do cleaning up.

01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:28.421
Just feel like

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:31.424
that's the only decision I'm
capable of making right now.

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:32.559
Am I the only one

01:01:32.561 --> 01:01:34.328
not stressed out about this?

01:01:35.763 --> 01:01:37.930
That's because you've made
less decisions than I have.

01:01:37.932 --> 01:01:39.098
And I've made barely any.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.766
You're making a
big deal out of this,

01:01:40.768 --> 01:01:42.935
I mean, most of this stuff,

01:01:42.937 --> 01:01:44.605
these particulars
don't bother me.

01:01:45.739 --> 01:01:46.575
Gee thanks.

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:48.607
I'm serious, Lizzy.

01:01:48.609 --> 01:01:50.943
I mean the wedding that you want

01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:52.412
we're gonna make it happen,

01:01:52.414 --> 01:01:54.682
whatever we have to do,
because it's all about you.

01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:58.884
I can give you two some
space if that's what you need.

01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:02.790
No, I want you to see this.

01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:06.561
James, what kinda
wedding do you want?

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.462
The kind of wedding I want is

01:02:09.464 --> 01:02:13.132
as long as you're there,
I'm there, and the pastor,

01:02:13.134 --> 01:02:14.900
then I'm happy

01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:16.436
And that's all?

01:02:16.438 --> 01:02:17.269
That's it.

01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:18.770
As long as you show up,

01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:21.907
then I don't have an idea of
a picture perfect wedding,

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:24.643
but I have an idea of a
picture perfect bride.

01:02:24.645 --> 01:02:25.580
And that's you.

01:02:28.483 --> 01:02:29.417
That's so sweet.

01:02:36.824 --> 01:02:39.727
Decisions, Lizzy, we
need to make decisions.

01:02:49.638 --> 01:02:51.003
So, what is it?

01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:52.905
Just wait until you see it.

01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:55.841
Now you're either gonna love
it or you're gonna hate it.

01:02:55.843 --> 01:02:58.977
I don't know which,
but I hope it's love.

01:02:58.979 --> 01:03:01.081
All right, ladies, I'll
leave you to it, huh?

01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:05.518
What's going on?

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.818
Well, I guess
you're just gonna have

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.590
to open the box and find out

01:03:13.428 --> 01:03:14.462
Mom!

01:03:16.363 --> 01:03:17.499
It's amazing.

01:03:19.266 --> 01:03:21.133
Honestly don't know what to say.

01:03:21.135 --> 01:03:22.635
There's something else inside.

01:03:22.637 --> 01:03:23.471
Take a look.

01:03:30.945 --> 01:03:31.877
Mom.

01:03:31.879 --> 01:03:33.178
Now, I know it's not much,

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:36.616
but your dad and I wanna
pay for your wedding.

01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:38.050
Now, you know how
your father is.

01:03:38.052 --> 01:03:40.453
He won't even tip more
than 10% in a restaurant

01:03:40.455 --> 01:03:43.855
but he really wants
to do this too.

01:03:43.857 --> 01:03:45.793
So you know how serious we are.

01:03:48.796 --> 01:03:50.028
I don't know what to say.

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:52.397
Just try on the
dress before I-

01:03:52.399 --> 01:03:54.534
This part and then
there's a little jacket

01:03:54.536 --> 01:03:55.400
that goes over it.

01:03:55.402 --> 01:03:57.002
It's really cute.

01:03:57.004 --> 01:03:58.673
And, veil!

01:04:00.174 --> 01:04:02.142
All right, hurry,
try it on, try it on.

01:04:08.749 --> 01:04:10.349
Well, it almost fits.

01:04:10.351 --> 01:04:12.084
Well, I can alter it.

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:13.752
I mean, I may not be the
best seamstress in the world,

01:04:13.754 --> 01:04:16.090
but this I can do.

01:04:18.359 --> 01:04:20.227
Ah, my little girl
is getting married!

01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:25.431
I'm gonna cry.

01:04:25.433 --> 01:04:26.832
That's the reaction I
thought I was gonna get

01:04:26.834 --> 01:04:28.033
when I first told you.

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:28.934
Oh stop.

01:04:28.936 --> 01:04:30.603
Don't say things like that.

01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:32.104
I was just a little concerned

01:04:32.106 --> 01:04:34.407
that you were getting married
a little quickly, that's all.

01:04:34.409 --> 01:04:39.414
But seeing you in my dress,
I just, oh, it's perfect.

01:04:44.385 --> 01:04:49.121
Well, hold that thought
while I go get this sewing kit.

01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:50.088
Okay.

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.591
Do you mind helping me?

01:04:51.593 --> 01:04:52.393
- I don't wanna get all caught-
- Let me help you, sweetie.

01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:56.295
Just get that.

01:04:56.297 --> 01:04:57.129
Perfect.

01:04:57.131 --> 01:04:58.397
Thank you.

01:04:58.399 --> 01:04:59.699
This is always
the hardest part.

01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:00.633
Awesome.

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:01.567
That's all right, thanks.

01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:02.367
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:05:02.369 --> 01:05:03.201
All right.

01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:04.704
Hey wait.

01:05:04.706 --> 01:05:07.105
Whatever you do, don't let
James see you in this dress.

01:05:07.107 --> 01:05:08.543
Oh, no worries.

01:05:26.327 --> 01:05:27.161
Got it.

01:05:28.962 --> 01:05:30.632
Hey Lizzy!

01:05:32.966 --> 01:05:34.736
Lizzy, where are you?

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:37.770
Lizzy?

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.145
Oh, there you are.

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:21.949
What, did you get
lost or something?

01:06:24.552 --> 01:06:25.386
Lizzy?

01:06:26.353 --> 01:06:28.320
Lizzy, what's wrong?

01:06:28.322 --> 01:06:31.524
Mom, I think it'd be
best if you just go home.

01:06:31.526 --> 01:06:33.793
I need to take care
of some things here.

01:06:33.795 --> 01:06:35.360
Honey, I'm not going anywhere

01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:37.830
till you tell me
what's going on.

01:06:37.832 --> 01:06:40.065
Just a minute ago you were as
happy as I've ever seen you

01:06:40.067 --> 01:06:41.503
and now look at you.

01:06:43.904 --> 01:06:46.238
I just need some
time by myself, please.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.743
Honey, not until you
tell me what's going on.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.980
I think we should
call off the wedding.

01:06:54.982 --> 01:06:56.148
What?

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:57.485
No, honey!

01:06:58.887 --> 01:07:00.720
No, I don't know what's going
on here, but we both know

01:07:00.722 --> 01:07:02.923
that you do not wanna
call this wedding off.

01:07:05.894 --> 01:07:07.159
Please just-

01:07:07.161 --> 01:07:09.764
- Honey, you and James
both love each other.

01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:12.698
You could tell by
the way you interact

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.933
and in the way you
look at each other

01:07:14.935 --> 01:07:16.201
when you think nobody's looking.

01:07:16.203 --> 01:07:17.904
Mom, just stop, stop,

01:07:17.906 --> 01:07:18.738
you don't know what's going on.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.408
Just leave, please.

01:07:26.414 --> 01:07:28.750
Sweetheart, I will respect

01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:35.287
that you don't wanna
talk to me, right now

01:07:35.289 --> 01:07:38.524
but I want you to
know whatever you need

01:07:38.526 --> 01:07:40.227
and whenever you're
ready to say,

01:07:41.763 --> 01:07:43.130
that I'm right here for you.

01:07:44.732 --> 01:07:45.567
Honey.

01:07:47.702 --> 01:07:49.067
You don't understand.

01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:51.704
I don't, you're right,
I don't understand.

01:07:51.706 --> 01:07:54.072
Please make me understand.

01:07:54.074 --> 01:07:55.808
I do not like seeing
you like this.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:58.043
I can tell you're hurting.

01:07:58.045 --> 01:08:00.278
Please let me help you, honey.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.814
Honey, please.

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:03.816
I don't know what to do.

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:07.655
It's okay, honey.

01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:13.461
I'll always be here for you.

01:08:22.135 --> 01:08:24.636
What if he does
love this other girl?

01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:26.305
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:08:27.742 --> 01:08:29.509
Hey, my friend,
you gotta get ready.

01:08:29.511 --> 01:08:31.944
We got our next
competition comin' up.

01:08:31.946 --> 01:08:34.682
I think Legacy will be
perfect for your show jumping.

01:08:36.015 --> 01:08:40.486
Hey Linda, can I check
something with you real quick?

01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:42.654
Sure, wait, wait,
lemme see you.

01:08:42.657 --> 01:08:44.356
Have you been crying?

01:08:44.358 --> 01:08:45.323
Are you all right?

01:08:45.325 --> 01:08:46.124
Are you okay?

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:46.961
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:48.429 --> 01:08:52.999
Hailey, can you do me a favor
and go check on Legacy for me?

01:08:53.001 --> 01:08:55.868
I've gotta talk to your
grandma about some adult stuff.

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.301
I'm not a little
kid, you know.

01:08:57.304 --> 01:09:00.104
Yeah, I know, but I'm
asking you as a friend.

01:09:00.107 --> 01:09:01.474
Really?

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:03.444
Yeah, I wouldn't ask
you if I didn't need it.

01:09:06.881 --> 01:09:08.649
What was the last
time you evented?

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:12.787
It's been awhile.

01:09:15.557 --> 01:09:17.890
Meet me up at the house.

01:09:37.745 --> 01:09:41.246
If I ask you a question, you'd
tell me the truth, right?

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:42.917
Come on, of course.

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:49.524
Is this you?

01:10:00.267 --> 01:10:01.701
Yes.

01:10:01.703 --> 01:10:04.937
This article says that
you're using drugs and steroids

01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.939
to make your horses
perform better.

01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:08.407
Is that true?

01:10:08.409 --> 01:10:10.910
Is that how you got
all those blue ribbons?

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:11.746
No.

01:10:13.081 --> 01:10:15.516
But you were banned
from eventing, right?

01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:22.289
Yes.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.194
Lizzy.

01:10:33.468 --> 01:10:34.634
Hey, you're back.

01:10:34.636 --> 01:10:35.568
Hey.

01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:37.472
Hey, what's going on?

01:10:48.315 --> 01:10:49.149
Lizzy!

01:10:54.287 --> 01:10:55.755
Can I talk to you?

01:10:55.757 --> 01:10:57.825
How can I believe anything
that you have to say?

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.561
Because I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

01:11:03.296 --> 01:11:04.899
Okay,
what's going on?

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:08.968
Is that why Legacy did so
well in the second competition?

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:10.469
Of course not, it's
because you two have worked

01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:12.405
so hard together, that's why.

01:11:12.407 --> 01:11:14.407
I can't believe anything
that you're saying.

01:11:14.409 --> 01:11:15.508
I don't know if
you're lying to me.

01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:17.410
I'm not a liar.

01:11:17.412 --> 01:11:18.245
I don't-

01:11:21.181 --> 01:11:23.582
- The newspaper article
you read, that's about me

01:11:23.584 --> 01:11:26.020
and yes, I was banned
from competing.

01:11:27.088 --> 01:11:29.187
So it is all true.

01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:31.023
None of it's true, none of it.

01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:34.325
Okay, I was about your age.

01:11:34.327 --> 01:11:35.161
I was riding.

01:11:35.163 --> 01:11:36.128
I was doing so well.

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:37.195
I was earning medals.

01:11:37.197 --> 01:11:39.100
I was top of my game.

01:11:40.101 --> 01:11:41.767
I loved it.

01:11:41.769 --> 01:11:44.537
And I didn't do
anything, I promise.

01:11:44.539 --> 01:11:45.705
Then why were you banned?

01:11:45.707 --> 01:11:49.043
Because I was horribly
betrayed my best,

01:11:51.045 --> 01:11:52.343
my best friend.

01:11:52.345 --> 01:11:55.981
My trainer was injecting
the horses with steroids

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:57.382
so that they would run faster.

01:11:57.384 --> 01:12:00.953
I didn't know anything about it.

01:12:00.955 --> 01:12:02.387
When they found out,

01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:04.726
they banned him from training
and then they banned me.

01:12:11.132 --> 01:12:14.332
Nobody would believe that I
didn't know anything about it

01:12:14.334 --> 01:12:18.204
so I just, I packed it all
in and I left the country.

01:12:18.206 --> 01:12:19.572
Why'd you come back?

01:12:19.574 --> 01:12:20.575
For the funeral.

01:12:22.242 --> 01:12:23.343
And then I met you.

01:12:24.512 --> 01:12:26.344
And I felt your heart,
I felt your passion,

01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:28.080
I felt your fire.

01:12:28.082 --> 01:12:29.684
And it reignited mine.

01:12:30.985 --> 01:12:33.351
So I knew I had to
stay and help you.

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:34.989
Grandma, what's going on?

01:12:36.157 --> 01:12:37.322
It's okay, baby.

01:12:37.324 --> 01:12:38.891
This was just about
me and my past

01:12:38.893 --> 01:12:40.260
and Lizzy needed to hear it.

01:12:43.598 --> 01:12:44.432
Look at me.

01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:49.435
I would never do
anything to hurt Legacy

01:12:49.437 --> 01:12:50.938
or to disappoint you, never.

01:12:51.873 --> 01:12:53.271
Please don't send us away.

01:12:53.273 --> 01:12:54.774
I wanna help Legacy too.

01:12:54.776 --> 01:12:55.608
I love her.

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:57.009
I really do.

01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:58.513
I'm not sending you away.

01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:01.547
I'm sorry.

01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:03.451
I shouldn't have got
as upset as I did.

01:13:04.786 --> 01:13:06.619
You have every right
to get upset, baby.

01:13:06.621 --> 01:13:08.353
You've got a lot going on now.

01:13:08.355 --> 01:13:10.288
You've got a lot on
your plate right now.

01:13:20.434 --> 01:13:22.136
What are you doing?

01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:28.207
Waiting.

01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:30.409
No, I'm talking
about the text messages

01:13:30.411 --> 01:13:32.444
and then the first
thing I see you're doing

01:13:32.446 --> 01:13:33.981
is you're taking off your ring?

01:13:34.816 --> 01:13:36.582
I'm doing it for a reason.

01:13:36.584 --> 01:13:38.920
What reason could
there possibly be?

01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:44.992
I think that we should
put a pause on this wedding.

01:13:47.028 --> 01:13:49.394
A pause, no, no,
there can be no pause.

01:13:49.396 --> 01:13:50.832
You said that much yourself.

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:54.166
Well, there's
going to have to be.

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.835
You know, this is
exactly what our parents-

01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:57.269
- This has nothing to do with
what our parents have said.

01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:59.307
Then what does
it have to do with?

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.980
I've read that
over and over again.

01:14:08.516 --> 01:14:10.683
Well, I haven't
even read this once.

01:14:10.685 --> 01:14:11.917
I didn't ask for it.

01:14:11.919 --> 01:14:13.254
I didn't want it.

01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:17.658
Okay, I didn't open it and
you shouldn't have either.

01:14:20.027 --> 01:14:21.827
Aren't you curious?

01:14:21.829 --> 01:14:23.329
No.

01:14:23.331 --> 01:14:25.967
You should have left it in
the trash where it belonged.

01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:34.440
Why didn't you tell me
that she'd given it to you?

01:14:34.442 --> 01:14:35.375
I don't know.

01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:38.477
I just want the truth.

01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:40.147
That's all I've ever
wanted from anyone.

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:44.218
I didn't wanna
hurt your feelings.

01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:47.019
If nothing was going on,

01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:48.787
then nothing would
hurt my feelings.

01:14:48.789 --> 01:14:50.388
Well nothing was going on.

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:52.057
I am not gonna
compete for you, James.

01:14:52.059 --> 01:14:53.559
And you're never
gonna have to.

01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:56.528
- I will not be second best.
- You're never gonna be.

01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:58.564
I've always felt
like I need to compete

01:14:58.566 --> 01:14:59.632
for everyone's attention,

01:14:59.634 --> 01:15:01.233
even my parents' attention

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:03.802
I felt like I had to compete
to get them to notice me.

01:15:03.804 --> 01:15:05.704
But with you, it was different.

01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:08.974
I felt like I could be
myself 100% of the time.

01:15:08.976 --> 01:15:11.043
And now I feel like you
want me to be something

01:15:11.045 --> 01:15:12.146
that I'm not.

01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:18.219
I can't compete with
someone else for you, James.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.752
What do you do-

01:15:19.754 --> 01:15:20.552
Where are you going?

01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:21.487
Are you leaving?

01:15:21.489 --> 01:15:23.055
I can't be here right now.

01:15:23.057 --> 01:15:24.425
You've got this all wrong.

01:15:25.326 --> 01:15:26.928
You kept this from me.

01:15:28.095 --> 01:15:29.828
Whatever's going on
between you and Bethany,

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.032
you tried to hide it.

01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:35.002
Just thought I was
doing the right thing.

01:15:57.058 --> 01:15:58.390
Go.

01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:14.775
Come in.

01:16:18.379 --> 01:16:19.780
Hey sweetheart.

01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:26.118
How are you feeling
this morning?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:26.954
Okay.

01:16:28.389 --> 01:16:31.323
I don't think I can go back
to the ranch today though.

01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:32.793
If James is still there.

01:16:33.995 --> 01:16:36.764
Do you want me to
talk to him for you?

01:16:38.165 --> 01:16:42.103
No, I might need you guys
to go get me some clothes.

01:16:43.304 --> 01:16:44.905
I'm gonna stay here
for a little while.

01:16:46.073 --> 01:16:47.339
I have some friends who
can take care of Hope

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:48.576
and Legacy for me.

01:16:50.311 --> 01:16:52.277
Just don't wanna
see James right now.

01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:54.847
Sweetheart, you
need to talk to him.

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:57.685
I'm sure this is all just
a big misunderstanding.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.086
You guys really
think I should go back?

01:17:01.088 --> 01:17:02.588
Nope.

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:03.591
Yes.

01:17:05.192 --> 01:17:07.793
Lizzy, when you're
married to someone,

01:17:07.795 --> 01:17:09.628
you need to
communicate with them.

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:14.199
Now, I don't know what this
letter said or who this girl is

01:17:14.201 --> 01:17:16.301
but I'm sure she's just
trying to cause problems

01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:19.038
between you two for no reason.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.874
I'm sure James is just
as confused as you are.

01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:23.342
The things she said, Mom.

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:26.345
Well, you said James,
didn't read the letter, right?

01:17:26.347 --> 01:17:27.880
Yeah, but why was
he trying to hide it

01:17:27.882 --> 01:17:29.348
from me in the first place?

01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:32.951
Oh honey, I'm sure he
just didn't wanna upset you.

01:17:32.953 --> 01:17:34.153
Exactly.

01:17:34.155 --> 01:17:36.355
Lizzy, no man wants
the woman that he loves

01:17:36.357 --> 01:17:37.990
to be upset with him.

01:17:37.992 --> 01:17:39.391
When your mother
and I got married,

01:17:39.393 --> 01:17:41.360
if I thought something
was gonna upset her

01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:43.562
I tried to keep
it nice and quiet.

01:17:43.564 --> 01:17:46.901
Inevitably, she always
found out and inevitably-

01:17:49.036 --> 01:17:51.904
- And inevitably
we both realized

01:17:51.906 --> 01:17:54.039
that it's better just
to be open and honest

01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:55.076
with one another.

01:17:56.478 --> 01:17:59.578
Now had these little situations
he'd been upfront with me,

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.180
they never would've bothered me.

01:18:01.182 --> 01:18:03.849
But I mean, it
took us a few years

01:18:03.851 --> 01:18:05.319
to figure that out, right?

01:18:06.187 --> 01:18:07.188
All life's lessons

01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:10.423
Lizzy, I would
almost guarantee you

01:18:10.425 --> 01:18:12.425
that James thought he was
trying to do the right thing

01:18:12.427 --> 01:18:13.959
by throwing away the letter.

01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:17.196
Granted, those letters should
not have been in your house

01:18:17.198 --> 01:18:21.568
but Lizzy, you are
marrying him for a reason.

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:24.736
You love him and you trust him.

01:18:24.738 --> 01:18:27.673
And the fact that he didn't
read those letters proves

01:18:27.675 --> 01:18:30.211
that he's the man that
you know that he is.

01:18:32.746 --> 01:18:36.784
Oh, I know, marriage,
Lizzy, it's scary.

01:18:37.952 --> 01:18:41.423
It's all about patience
and trust and honesty.

01:18:42.424 --> 01:18:45.624
But honey, from what I've seen,

01:18:45.626 --> 01:18:48.395
James has always
been honest with you.

01:18:50.097 --> 01:18:51.765
So you need to trust him.

01:18:53.934 --> 01:18:55.035
It'll all be worth it.

01:19:30.472 --> 01:19:31.473
Hey James.

01:19:32.907 --> 01:19:33.741
No hugs.

01:19:34.609 --> 01:19:36.175
You came here to see me right.

01:19:36.177 --> 01:19:37.809
I came here to talk to you.

01:19:37.811 --> 01:19:39.077
Then talk.

01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:40.513
You came here for a reason.

01:19:40.515 --> 01:19:42.981
It's for a reason
you're not gonna like.

01:19:42.983 --> 01:19:44.183
James, you-

01:19:44.185 --> 01:19:46.185
- You shouldn't
have written me this

01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:48.187
and I never should've taken it.

01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:50.355
And that's a mistake
I'm here to fix.

01:19:50.357 --> 01:19:51.823
If it was a mistake,
then why did you read it?

01:19:51.825 --> 01:19:52.659
I didn't read it.

01:19:52.661 --> 01:19:53.827
Then why is it open?

01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:57.162
I'm sorry if I gave
you any indication

01:19:57.164 --> 01:19:59.599
that I had feelings
for you, but I don't.

01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:02.801
I asked Lizzy to
marry me, nobody else.

01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:03.636
I don't want it!

01:20:03.638 --> 01:20:04.537
Take it.

01:20:04.539 --> 01:20:05.370
I wrote it for you.

01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:06.338
Read it.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.039
Just take this!

01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:08.340
No.

01:20:08.342 --> 01:20:09.708
I hope you find someone.

01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:12.711
I really do, but
it's not gonna be me.

01:20:21.055 --> 01:20:23.991
Now, honey I know
you're not sick

01:20:25.359 --> 01:20:27.828
but I made you your
special chicken curry pie.

01:20:28.996 --> 01:20:29.895
Dad, last time you
made that for me,

01:20:29.897 --> 01:20:30.729
I was sick for like a week.

01:20:30.731 --> 01:20:32.331
Yeah, but now we know

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:35.133
not to use the frozen chicken
without the date on it, right?

01:20:35.135 --> 01:20:35.970
Yeah.

01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:41.308
Thanks.

01:20:46.213 --> 01:20:48.550
Dad, I've been thinking and,

01:20:49.984 --> 01:20:50.751
I'm sorry

01:20:52.086 --> 01:20:52.886
For what?

01:20:54.922 --> 01:20:59.692
I never thought about
how you'd be feeling

01:20:59.694 --> 01:21:01.594
with Grandma's death
and everything.

01:21:01.596 --> 01:21:03.230
I mean, she was your mom.

01:21:04.432 --> 01:21:05.698
I've just been so
focused on myself

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.934
and everything going
on with my life.

01:21:08.936 --> 01:21:10.269
I didn't think about you.

01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:11.870
Kiddo, you don't have
to apologize to me.

01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:13.372
I'm your father.

01:21:13.374 --> 01:21:15.774
I'm supposed to worry
about your feelings

01:21:15.776 --> 01:21:18.277
but you do have a lot
on your plate right now.

01:21:18.279 --> 01:21:21.046
I mean that ranch
is a lot of work.

01:21:21.048 --> 01:21:21.880
Trust me, I know.

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:23.449
I lived there.

01:21:23.451 --> 01:21:24.785
You sure you wanna do this?

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.952
Are you sure you wanna keep it?

01:21:26.954 --> 01:21:29.455
Yeah, I mean, how
could you ask me that?

01:21:29.457 --> 01:21:30.523
It's my home.

01:21:30.525 --> 01:21:31.957
I love it.

01:21:31.959 --> 01:21:33.992
Well, yeah, it's my home too.

01:21:33.994 --> 01:21:35.794
But nobody'd blame
you if you sold it.

01:21:35.796 --> 01:21:37.296
It'd be a nice little
nest egg for you

01:21:37.298 --> 01:21:38.633
to getting started in life.

01:21:40.535 --> 01:21:44.102
Dad, I know the ranch
isn't your dream for my life.

01:21:44.104 --> 01:21:48.710
Definitely wasn't your dream
for you, but it's my home now.

01:21:52.046 --> 01:21:54.449
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to keep it going.

01:21:55.883 --> 01:21:56.651
Okay.

01:21:58.152 --> 01:21:59.621
Well, I guess grandma left
to the right person, huh?

01:22:01.088 --> 01:22:02.424
I think she knew
what she was doing.

01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:04.923
Eat all that.

01:22:04.925 --> 01:22:06.628
I checked the date
on it, I promise.

01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:08.962
All right

01:22:35.356 --> 01:22:36.190
Lizzy.

01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:40.058
What are
you doing here?

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.094
I need you to come
back to the ranch.

01:22:42.096 --> 01:22:43.362
Why?

01:22:43.364 --> 01:22:44.799
Because I wanna marry you.

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.133
What about Bethany?

01:22:48.135 --> 01:22:49.669
Bethany, who cares about her?

01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:50.503
I don't.

01:22:50.505 --> 01:22:52.538
She means nothing to me.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.706
And the letter?

01:22:53.708 --> 01:22:54.940
I destroyed it

01:22:54.942 --> 01:22:56.975
like I should've done
in the first place.

01:22:56.977 --> 01:22:58.310
Why?

01:22:58.312 --> 01:22:59.812
Because I love you, Lizzy.

01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:00.981
Isn't it obvious?

01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:04.049
The wedding's
only a week away?

01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:08.956
It is and I will be at
that church waiting for you.

01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.259
Lizzy, all I can think about,

01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:18.165
all I can dream about is
being together with you.

01:23:19.467 --> 01:23:24.069
I cannot envision
myself in any other way

01:23:24.071 --> 01:23:25.904
than being with you.

01:23:29.376 --> 01:23:31.413
So what kinda wedding
you got planned?

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:34.381
I haven't got that far yet

01:23:35.483 --> 01:23:37.585
but I was hoping I
could get a little help.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.154
You know I couldn't leave
to plan a wedding by yourself,

01:23:42.156 --> 01:23:43.556
even with Emmett's help.

01:23:43.558 --> 01:23:46.093
No, that's why I
need you beside me.

01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:47.995
To hold your hand?

01:23:48.929 --> 01:23:50.264
That would be nice.

01:23:52.032 --> 01:23:54.101
Are you sure you
really wanna do this?

01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:57.770
I haven't hesitated yet.

01:23:57.772 --> 01:23:58.673
I'm not about to.

01:24:00.107 --> 01:24:04.009
I will be there at
the church waiting

01:24:04.011 --> 01:24:05.212
to hear you say I do.

01:24:09.751 --> 01:24:10.951
How's Legacy?

01:24:12.252 --> 01:24:13.086
Legacy?

01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:15.788
You've only been
gone for like a day.

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:19.059
I know, but I
miss her and Hope.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:20.927
Well, why don't you
come back to the ranch

01:24:20.929 --> 01:24:21.962
and find out.

01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:25.265
I'm sure they'd be
happy to see you too.

01:24:26.099 --> 01:24:26.935
Okay.

01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:40.446
Hello.

01:24:40.448 --> 01:24:41.549
Hi.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:43.984
Lizzy!

01:24:56.464 --> 01:24:57.663
Well, honestly,
there was a part of me

01:24:57.665 --> 01:25:00.165
that wondered if I would
ever see you again.

01:25:00.167 --> 01:25:01.301
Of course you would.

01:25:02.302 --> 01:25:04.169
Never know.

01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:08.006
I just had to, you
know, takes some space

01:25:08.008 --> 01:25:10.843
to, you know, clear my
head and figure things out

01:25:10.845 --> 01:25:13.347
'cause it was just a lot.

01:25:14.782 --> 01:25:15.915
But I feel better now.

01:25:15.917 --> 01:25:17.517
Good, how about some lemonade?

01:25:17.519 --> 01:25:18.918
We go inside.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.118
No, I don't have time.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.187
I gotta focus on the next event.

01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:23.290
That's why I came here

01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:27.894
'cause I need you guys.

01:25:27.896 --> 01:25:30.830
It's show jumping and I
haven't done it in a long time.

01:25:30.832 --> 01:25:33.131
I think we've had this
conversation before, Lizzy.

01:25:33.133 --> 01:25:35.701
Yeah, but it's
different this time.

01:25:35.703 --> 01:25:36.538
How?

01:25:37.939 --> 01:25:41.007
It's not just about me
and Legacy winning anymore.

01:25:41.009 --> 01:25:43.043
'Cause I wanna clear your name.

01:25:45.379 --> 01:25:46.712
You wanna what?

01:25:46.714 --> 01:25:49.047
I don't know how, but
everybody just needs

01:25:49.049 --> 01:25:50.550
to know that you're
not a cheat, you know?

01:25:50.552 --> 01:25:53.053
And I feel like this
event could do that.

01:25:54.154 --> 01:25:55.220
That's so nice

01:25:55.222 --> 01:25:57.557
and I really
appreciate it, but no,

01:25:57.559 --> 01:25:59.559
I don't think I wanna
put you through that.

01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:01.794
I am definitely up
for the challenge.

01:26:01.796 --> 01:26:03.194
That's a big challenge.

01:26:03.196 --> 01:26:04.463
It's worth it.

01:26:04.465 --> 01:26:06.699
I mean, you've been
helping out so much

01:26:06.701 --> 01:26:11.639
and I haven't been doing
as much as I could have.

01:26:13.408 --> 01:26:15.575
So you were right
to criticize me

01:26:15.577 --> 01:26:18.376
but it's all different now.

01:26:18.378 --> 01:26:20.515
I'm more focused and it's not,

01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:23.348
it's not about me anymore.

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:25.383
It's about you guys.

01:26:25.385 --> 01:26:26.752
It's so much more.

01:26:26.754 --> 01:26:28.188
You don't need me for that.

01:26:29.356 --> 01:26:31.356
I can't show
jump without Legacy

01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:33.695
but I definitely can't
finish this without you.

01:26:52.914 --> 01:26:55.548
You're competing
against her again, right?

01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.248
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.086
You'll be fine.

01:26:59.286 --> 01:27:00.586
I mean, this is
her whole life.

01:27:00.588 --> 01:27:02.120
It's all she does.

01:27:02.122 --> 01:27:04.557
It seems like I'm never gonna
not compete against her.

01:27:04.559 --> 01:27:05.793
Okay, come on.

01:27:07.595 --> 01:27:08.628
I need you to get
your head together.

01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:09.862
Be ready, okay?

01:27:09.864 --> 01:27:11.363
I'm ready.

01:27:11.365 --> 01:27:13.298
Somehow I believe that.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.901
I just have a feeling that
you're gonna be amazing.

01:27:15.903 --> 01:27:17.135
This is gonna happen.

01:27:17.137 --> 01:27:18.938
I can count on you this time.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:22.108
It's for you and Legacy
this time so it's different.

01:27:22.110 --> 01:27:23.308
Lizzy, you're the best here.

01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:25.310
We'll be cheering
you all the way.

01:27:25.312 --> 01:27:26.146
Thanks.

01:27:27.582 --> 01:27:30.752
Yeah, no more coming
in second place.

01:27:31.619 --> 01:27:33.052
Only by winning this thing

01:27:33.054 --> 01:27:35.253
can I really prove how
great of a horse Legacy is.

01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:37.657
And for you too, Lizzy.

01:27:37.659 --> 01:27:38.658
You're great rider.

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:41.060
I don't want you to forget that.

01:27:41.062 --> 01:27:43.896
Go on and show 'em
what you can do, baby.

01:27:56.343 --> 01:27:57.177
Hey.

01:27:58.746 --> 01:28:00.345
Look, I'm not
interested in anything

01:28:00.347 --> 01:28:01.312
you have to say.

01:28:01.314 --> 01:28:02.917
I'm just focusing on my jumps.

01:28:04.686 --> 01:28:06.351
I wanna make you an offer.

01:28:06.353 --> 01:28:08.587
What could
you possibly offer me?

01:28:08.589 --> 01:28:09.356
Let me win.

01:28:10.525 --> 01:28:13.695
Forfeit, take your
horse and go home

01:28:14.962 --> 01:28:16.829
and you never have
to see me again.

01:28:16.831 --> 01:28:17.632
What?

01:28:19.801 --> 01:28:21.701
This means more to
me than it does to you.

01:28:21.703 --> 01:28:23.201
You know that, right?

01:28:23.203 --> 01:28:24.837
You don't know anything.

01:28:24.839 --> 01:28:27.374
This isn't just about me
proving you wrong anymore.

01:28:29.143 --> 01:28:32.712
Let me win or
you'll regret it.

01:28:32.714 --> 01:28:33.713
No deal.

01:28:33.715 --> 01:28:35.681
You can't bully me anymore.

01:28:35.683 --> 01:28:37.883
I'm only gonna
make this offer once.

01:28:37.885 --> 01:28:40.019
Well, my answer
isn't gonna change.

01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:42.557
You have no power here
so you can't bully me.

01:28:43.524 --> 01:28:44.389
Oh no?

01:28:44.391 --> 01:28:45.658
Yeah, you know,

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:47.392
I'm sorry you thought
you could steal my life,

01:28:47.394 --> 01:28:48.561
but it's mine.

01:28:48.563 --> 01:28:49.530
So get your own.

01:29:53.293 --> 01:29:54.128
Come on!

01:32:43.731 --> 01:32:46.231
There's only one
thing that I wanna say.

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:48.467
This belongs to Linda Locke

01:32:48.469 --> 01:32:50.237
just as much as
it belongs to me.

01:32:51.305 --> 01:32:53.138
Some of you might think
you know her past,

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.709
but you couldn't be more wrong.

01:32:56.077 --> 01:32:57.912
I couldn't have done
this without her

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.480
and I can never be
thankful enough.

01:33:40.855 --> 01:33:42.521
I'd like to welcome
you to the wedding

01:33:42.523 --> 01:33:44.457
of James and Elizabeth.

01:33:44.459 --> 01:33:46.191
But before we begin,
I'd like to talk

01:33:46.193 --> 01:33:49.094
to you about what I shared
with them in counseling.

01:33:49.096 --> 01:33:50.763
We talked about life.

01:33:50.765 --> 01:33:52.299
We talked about relationships.

01:33:54.035 --> 01:33:59.040
Love comes easy, struggling
with what happens

01:34:00.207 --> 01:34:02.509
on the day to day is
gonna be the hardest.

01:34:02.511 --> 01:34:03.842
You're gonna get the
best of each other

01:34:03.844 --> 01:34:06.278
and you're gonna get
the worst of each other.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.183
Your marriage must be
first rooted in the Lord.

01:34:10.851 --> 01:34:11.817
Are you ready?

01:34:11.819 --> 01:34:12.651
Yes.

01:34:12.653 --> 01:34:13.486
Are you ready?

01:34:13.488 --> 01:34:14.386
Yes.

01:34:14.388 --> 01:34:16.221
All right, let's do this.

01:34:16.223 --> 01:34:18.390
Do you, James Mifflin,

01:34:18.392 --> 01:34:21.760
take Elizabeth to be your
lawfully wedded wife,

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:25.364
to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish,

01:34:25.366 --> 01:34:26.533
till death do you part?

01:34:26.535 --> 01:34:27.368
I do.

01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:30.969
Do you, Elizabeth, take James

01:34:30.971 --> 01:34:32.971
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

01:34:32.973 --> 01:34:36.341
to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish,

01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:37.576
till death do you part?

01:34:37.578 --> 01:34:38.511
I do.

01:34:38.513 --> 01:34:39.747
You both have the rings.

01:34:43.918 --> 01:34:44.852
You're doin' great.

01:34:51.859 --> 01:34:55.260
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:34:55.262 --> 01:34:57.396
You may kiss the bride.

01:36:23.784 --> 01:36:25.284
Ready?

01:36:40.502 --> 01:36:41.934
- I can't believe it.
- Unbelievable.

01:36:41.936 --> 01:36:44.036
So how did we do?

01:36:44.038 --> 01:36:45.871
You guys did great.

01:36:45.873 --> 01:36:47.973
I've never been
happier in my life.

01:36:47.975 --> 01:36:49.442
Well here's to your health

01:36:49.444 --> 01:36:51.843
and a long happy
marriage full of love.

01:36:51.845 --> 01:36:53.446
Best wishes to the bride.

01:36:53.448 --> 01:36:56.148
- Congratulations to the groom.
- Yes sir.

01:36:56.150 --> 01:36:56.984
Thank you.

01:38:07.455 --> 01:38:08.621
I'm gonna teach you how to ride

01:38:08.623 --> 01:38:10.124
just like my grandma taught me.

01:38:12.026 --> 01:38:14.126
Could I ever be as
good as you one day?

01:38:14.128 --> 01:38:15.027
You'll be better.

01:38:15.029 --> 01:38:16.128
Are you ready?

01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:17.430
Yes.

01:38:17.432 --> 01:38:18.799
I can't believe I'm
actually doing this.

01:38:20.468 --> 01:38:21.534
You're looking good out there.

01:38:21.536 --> 01:38:23.402
Oh yeah!

01:38:23.404 --> 01:38:24.572
Okay, let's go.

01:38:30.077 --> 01:38:31.078
Yes!

01:38:33.113 --> 01:38:35.113
- You go girl.
- Wow.

01:38:35.115 --> 01:38:36.451
So proud of you.

01:38:37.786 --> 01:38:38.653
- Huh?
- Yeah.
