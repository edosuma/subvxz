01:18.200 --> 01:21.431
I was Flint's first mate
that voyage...

01:21.520 --> 01:24.592
three days east of Tortola
in the Caribie.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.035
Flint knew an island.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.111
That's where we buried
the treasure.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.273
Gold and blood,
they were Flint's trademarks.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.238
He'd leave both
behind him that day.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.995
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my soul</i>

01:44.080 --> 01:47.117
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

01:47.200 --> 01:51.352
<i>There are men whose hearts</i>
<i>are as black as coal</i>

01:51.440 --> 01:53.908
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

01:54.000 --> 01:57.549
<i>And they sailed their ship</i>
<i>'cross the ocean blue</i>

01:57.640 --> 02:00.632
<i>A bloodthirsty captain</i>
<i>and a cutthroat crew</i>

02:00.720 --> 02:04.315
<i>It's as dark a tale</i>
<i>as was ever told</i>

02:04.400 --> 02:09.520
<i>Of the lust for treasure</i>
<i>and the love of gold</i>

02:09.600 --> 02:13.832
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my sides</i>

02:13.920 --> 02:16.275
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

02:16.360 --> 02:19.989
<i>There are hungers as strong</i>
<i>as the winds and tides</i>

02:20.080 --> 02:22.878
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

02:22.960 --> 02:26.714
<i>And those buccaneers</i>
<i>drown their sins in rum</i>

02:26.800 --> 02:30.076
<i>The devil himself would</i>
<i>have to call them scum</i>

02:30.160 --> 02:33.596
<i>Every man aboard would have</i>
<i>killed his mate</i>

02:33.680 --> 02:37.229
<i>For a bag of guineas</i>
<i>or a piece of eight</i>

02:37.320 --> 02:39.151
<i>A piece of eight</i>

02:39.240 --> 02:42.710
<i>-A piece of eight</i>
<i>-A five, six, seven, eight</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:45.598
<i>Hulla wacka, ulla wacka</i>
<i>Something not right</i>

02:45.680 --> 02:49.434
<i>Many wicked icky things</i>
<i>gonna happen tonight</i>

02:49.520 --> 02:51.988
<i>Hulla wacka, moolah wacka</i>
<i>Sailor man beware</i>

02:52.080 --> 02:56.073
<i>When de money in de ground</i>
<i>Dere's murder in de air</i>

02:56.160 --> 02:57.991
<i>Murder in the air</i>

02:58.080 --> 02:59.832
One more time now.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.878
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my bones</i>

03:02.960 --> 03:06.236
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

03:06.320 --> 03:10.632
<i>There are secrets that sleep</i>
<i>with old Davy Jones</i>

03:10.720 --> 03:12.950
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

03:13.040 --> 03:16.316
<i>When the mainsail's set</i>
<i>and the anchor's weighed</i>

03:16.400 --> 03:19.995
<i>There's no turning back</i>
<i>from any course that's laid</i>

03:20.080 --> 03:23.675
<i>And when greed and villainy</i>
<i>sail the sea</i>

03:23.760 --> 03:28.959
<i>You can bet your boots</i>
<i>there'll be treachery</i>

03:37.640 --> 03:40.950
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my sails</i>

03:41.040 --> 03:43.429
<i>Dead men tell no tales</i>

03:45.680 --> 03:49.434
Oh, aye. Fifteen men
went ashore that day...

03:49.520 --> 03:53.308
and only Flint, his own self,
returned.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.155
Oh, aye, and then old Flinty...

03:56.240 --> 04:00.313
up and died afore they could get
back to that cursed island...

04:00.400 --> 04:02.630
and dig up the treasure.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.191
No one knows to this day
who has old Flint's map.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.556
Now, isn't that a story
worth the hearing?

04:10.640 --> 04:13.279
It was the first dozen
times we heard it.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.999
I'll drink to that.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.038
But who has
the map now, huh?

04:19.120 --> 04:22.829
Some black-hearted,
squid-suckin' buccaneer?

04:22.920 --> 04:26.549
Or maybe it's
our very own Jim Hawkins.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.471
Eh,Jimmy?

04:28.560 --> 04:31.518
If I had it, my friends and I wouldn't
be here serving you rum, Mr Bones.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.989
That's right. We'd be out
searching for that treasure...

04:34.080 --> 04:36.913
sailing the seven seas
on a five-year mission...

04:37.000 --> 04:40.072
boldly going where no man
has gone before.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.390
- Say, that's catchy.
- Huh. Not me.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.473
If I had that treasure map,
I'd be tradin' it for a decent meal.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.790
Hey, Gonzo, you think
he's gonna eat this?

04:48.880 --> 04:52.953
Aye! Beware the one-legged man!
He's the one to fear!

04:53.040 --> 04:54.712
Don't worry, Captain.
We'll watch for him.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.519
Yeah, I'll watch for him,
if he's deliverin' a pizza.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.271
Even old Flinty
feared him.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.114
If he comes pokin' 'round here,
you run for me whippety-quick!

05:05.200 --> 05:07.760
- If we see him, we'll tell you.
- Yeah. One leg, three heads...

05:07.840 --> 05:09.671
couple of dozen noses--
if anything weird happens--

05:09.760 --> 05:12.797
And it'll be nay
jokin' matter, hose nose.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.838
The one-legged man
brings death.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.229
Time, gentlemen!

05:18.320 --> 05:20.151
It's closing time!

05:20.240 --> 05:22.390
Ya pays your bills,
and then ya shove off.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.436
Go on. Out ya go!

05:26.880 --> 05:29.189
Oh, you're drunk again,
are ya?

05:29.280 --> 05:32.158
Boys, look at the state
of this place!

05:32.240 --> 05:34.549
How comes it gets to be
such a pigsty, huh?

05:34.640 --> 05:36.471
Pigsty? Hey!

05:36.560 --> 05:38.710
No offence meant, gentlemen, sirs.
No offence meant.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.030
- Here's to you, boys!
- Time!

05:41.120 --> 05:43.190
- I'm away to my room.
- Thank you, Mr Bones.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.633
- Thank you, Bill.
- There you go!

05:44.720 --> 05:47.632
Don't forget to come back tomorrow
for our lunchtime special:

05:47.720 --> 05:49.597
- roast suckling--
- Huh?

05:49.680 --> 05:52.274
- Potatoes, sir. Potatoes.
- All right.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.193
No-- No offence, madam.
No offence.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.670
All right, boys.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.320
When you're finished here,
you can go and clean up in the kitchen.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.119
I left some table scraps
in there for your supper.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.760
Oh, yes, and, boys...

06:07.840 --> 06:10.400
last night you forgot
to put out the lantern!

06:10.480 --> 06:15.190
If you forget that again,
there'll be no table scraps for a week!

06:16.480 --> 06:18.869
You're standing on my ear.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.951
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, Rizzo!

06:21.040 --> 06:23.952
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's it. Steady.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.032
- I hate my life.
- I hate your life too.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.954
- If I had a life, I'd hate it.
- I should just run off to sea

06:31.040 --> 06:34.635
He was my age when he sailed
to China as a cabin boy

06:34.720 --> 06:36.631
Run off to sea
and just leave everybody?

06:36.720 --> 06:39.359
Who's everybody?
I'm an orphan. I've got no family.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.557
- Hey, you got us!
- Yeah, we're family. Got it.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.798
I mean, some family we are. Be serious,
Rizzo. We don't exactly look alike.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.954
Okay, all right. So I'm a rat and you're
a human being and Gonzo's a, uh--

06:57.040 --> 06:59.508
- Whatever.
- Yeah. We're still family.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.353
- Yeah.
- But I wish my life were more like...

07:02.440 --> 07:04.158
one of Captain Bones'
adventures...

07:04.240 --> 07:06.708
sailing the high seas and
searching for buried treasure.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.679
Yeah, discovering lost islands
and weird civilizations.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.911
Navigating with my father's old compass
to wherever the wind may take us.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.436
- Off to Zanzibar
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.590
To the southwest,
pirate galleons!

07:19.680 --> 07:22.877
To the southeast, multi-armed
Zanzibanian shark women...

07:22.960 --> 07:24.951
and their exploding wigs
of death!

07:25.040 --> 07:27.679
To the northwest,
dirty dishes!

07:27.760 --> 07:29.591
How does she do that?

07:29.680 --> 07:32.717
- Might as well start. I'll wash.
- Oh, yeah. I'll dry.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.597
I'll break.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.910
<i>I look around here</i>
<i>and I want to cry</i>

07:42.000 --> 07:43.831
Me too. Yeah.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.992
<i>I feel like the world</i>
<i>is passing me by</i>

07:47.080 --> 07:48.433
It is.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.954
<i>And I just can't</i>
<i>help but wonder</i>

07:51.040 --> 07:53.429
<i>Am I doomed to wash and dry</i>

07:53.520 --> 07:58.719
<i>And is it a curse I'm under</i>
<i>to do it till I die</i>

07:58.800 --> 08:01.268
- Oh, I hope not.
- Yeah.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.749
<i>- When I could be an explorer</i>
- Sure ya could.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.990
<i>- Sailing off to distant lands</i>
- Not so fast.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.911
<i>Instead of spending</i>
<i>every afternoon</i>

08:08.000 --> 08:10.070
<i>Just getting dishpan hands</i>

08:10.160 --> 08:14.392
<i>My future looks like nowhere</i>
<i>that I want to be</i>

08:14.480 --> 08:17.517
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better</i>

08:17.600 --> 08:19.033
<i>Something better</i>

08:19.120 --> 08:23.193
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>better than this for me</i>

08:23.280 --> 08:24.918
Well, now you're talkin'.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.073
<i>If it's weird and wild</i>
<i>let's go and find it</i>

08:29.160 --> 08:31.913
<i>The crazier, the better</i>
<i>is what I say</i>

08:32.000 --> 08:33.399
Yeah, that's true.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.517
<i>To tell the truth</i>
<i>I really wouldn't mind it</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:37.510
Mind what?

08:37.600 --> 08:42.674
<i>If we found someplace</i>
<i>with ten square meals a day</i>

08:42.760 --> 08:44.591
<i>Let danger call my name</i>

08:44.680 --> 08:47.114
<i>If it does</i>
<i>I'm gonna hide</i>

08:47.200 --> 08:50.158
<i>I'll put my courage</i>
<i>to the test</i>

08:50.240 --> 08:52.310
<i>And I'll be</i>
<i>by your side</i>

08:52.400 --> 08:54.391
<i>He'll be by your side</i>

08:54.480 --> 08:59.554
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better than this</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:03.155
<i>- Something more than this</i>
<i>- I know that there's so much out there</i>

09:03.240 --> 09:06.073
<i>- To see</i>
<i>- To see</i>

09:06.160 --> 09:08.310
<i>And I know</i>
<i>this life I'm living</i>

09:08.400 --> 09:12.393
<i>Can't be my destiny</i>

09:12.480 --> 09:16.109
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better</i>

09:16.200 --> 09:17.918
<i>Something better</i>

09:18.000 --> 09:21.709
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>better than this for me</i>

09:21.800 --> 09:25.190
- And me!
- Wait a minute. What about me?

09:25.280 --> 09:30.070
<i>There's something better</i>
<i>than this for you and</i>

09:30.160 --> 09:40.400
<i>Me</i>

09:40.480 --> 09:42.596
Enough of this singin'!

09:42.760 --> 09:45.433
Rum! I need rum, lads!

09:45.520 --> 09:48.830
I got the horrors!
Give me rum!

09:48.920 --> 09:50.558
Rum till I float!

09:50.640 --> 09:53.757
All right! All right!
Just one small one.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.479
Don't be giving him
any more rum!

09:56.560 --> 09:59.916
How does she blooming do that?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.274
Shh! Shh!

10:23.760 --> 10:29.118
Billy Bones!
It's me, Blind Pew.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.590
I know you're here, Billy.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.353
Ya snivelling coward!

10:35.440 --> 10:38.318
It's some kind
of a blind fiend.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.311
I believe they prefer
''visually challenged fiend.''

10:40.400 --> 10:45.190
Ah, I heard that!
There's someone here!

10:45.280 --> 10:47.510
Uh, no. Over here!

10:50.320 --> 10:52.231
Hmm, over here.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.075
Billy Bones! Ah,
I'd know that scurvy mug...

11:00.160 --> 11:03.197
of yours anywhere.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.191
Excuse me, sir,
but the bar is closed.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.199
Aha. A pretty
little girl, is it?

11:11.280 --> 11:15.193
Yes. Take me
to Billy Bones, my pet.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.952
Y-You've come
to the wrong place.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.918
Th-There's no Billy Bones here,
and I'm not a girl.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.120
Oh, I may be visually challenged,
but I can see you're lying.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.952
Huh?

11:28.880 --> 11:33.192
Good evening, Bill.
I know it's you.

11:33.280 --> 11:37.831
Yes. You thought you could
get away with it, didn't you?

11:37.920 --> 11:40.434
Just take it all
for yourself...

11:40.520 --> 11:44.718
and leave your shipmates
with nothing.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.429
We're not pleased with that,
Bill. Not at all.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.798
We want you to have this!

12:06.920 --> 12:09.150
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cat!

12:23.920 --> 12:26.309
The Black Spot!

12:34.960 --> 12:37.758
But I don't understand.
What is the Black Spot?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.400
The Black Spot's
a pirate's death sentence!

12:40.480 --> 12:44.473
- Fabulous.
- They'll be comin' to kill me tonight!

12:44.560 --> 12:46.391
- We'd better help.
- Yeah, yeah, let's get some stuff.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.916
- It's my sea chest them lubbers want.
- Underwear.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.913
But I'll trick them! I'll shake out
another reef and daddle 'em again!

12:54.000 --> 12:57.197
You wanna run that by us again
in English, Mr Bones?

12:57.280 --> 12:59.589
It's mine! I'm goin'
for that treasure myself!

12:59.680 --> 13:02.990
And no one-legged
son of a bilge rat will--

13:05.720 --> 13:06.869
Captain Bones!

13:08.360 --> 13:13.070
He died? And this is supposed
to be a kids' movie.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.232
Jimmy.Jim.
Jimmy,Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.198
You always been a decent sort
to old Billy Bones.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.589
But I'm not Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.319
He's Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.833
-Jim!
- Yes, Captain.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.229
Jim,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jim,
Jim,Jim,Jim.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.550
- Yes, Captain. What is it?
- Take the map!

13:30.640 --> 13:32.949
- What map?
- The map to old Flint's treasure!

13:33.040 --> 13:34.871
Don't ya understand
what I been tellin' ya?

13:34.960 --> 13:38.236
I was Flinty's first mate!
We all were! Blind Pew and me!

13:38.320 --> 13:40.311
Me own shipmates,
they'll gully me for sure!

13:40.400 --> 13:42.356
And anybody else to get
their mitts on that map!

13:42.440 --> 13:44.476
A-And gullying hurts, right?

13:44.560 --> 13:46.516
Oh, aye! A lot!

13:46.600 --> 13:49.433
- So quick.
- Go to my sea chest! Get the map!

13:49.520 --> 13:51.397
Oh, yeah.

13:51.480 --> 13:55.439
- Oh, there. There.
- Oh, I think I've-- Oh, no.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.478
- Hey, guys, look!
- Rizzo!

13:58.560 --> 14:00.391
Oh, here!
How about this?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.391
Let's see.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.795
Hey, Rizzo, look.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.956
- It is a treasure map.
- We're gonna be rich.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.871
- We're gonna be dead.
- Beware, lads!

14:18.960 --> 14:20.951
Beware!

14:21.040 --> 14:23.508
- What? The one-legged man?
- Aye! But also...

14:23.600 --> 14:27.912
beware runnin' with scissors
or any other pointy objects.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.630
It's all good fun till
somebody loses an--

14:33.840 --> 14:35.671
Captain?

14:37.280 --> 14:40.317
We're standing in a room
with a dead guy!

14:45.720 --> 14:47.631
Jim!

14:56.880 --> 15:01.556
Oh, Billy Bones!
Trick or treat!

15:03.680 --> 15:05.989
Don't try to hide, Billy!
You know what we want!

15:13.160 --> 15:17.199
Where are ya, Billy Bones?
Where are ya, Billy?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.632
Mrs Bluveridge!

15:20.720 --> 15:24.554
There's no use in hiding!

15:24.640 --> 15:27.279
Can't a woman get her
beauty sleep any more?

15:28.400 --> 15:30.709
Jim, what you doing?

15:32.680 --> 15:34.875
Aha! Aha!

15:34.960 --> 15:37.793
Oh! Voila!

15:41.280 --> 15:43.510
- Okay, okay. I found the gun.
- Oh, now we gotta load it.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.068
- Okay.
- Oops.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.229
Okay, where does Mrs Bluveridge
keep the bullets?

15:50.320 --> 15:54.552
Billy's dead, and he hasn't
got the blooming map!

15:54.640 --> 15:57.108
- Those little girls must have it.
- Yeah!

15:57.200 --> 15:59.031
- Get them!
- Yeah!

15:59.120 --> 16:00.951
- Gonzo! Gonzo!
- What? What?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.918
I found the bullets. See?
Here they are. They--

16:04.000 --> 16:05.911
Oops.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.639
Open up in there!
We wants the map...

16:08.720 --> 16:11.598
and we'll skewer anybody
who gets in the way!

16:11.680 --> 16:14.353
Quick,Jim! The back stairs!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.271
Come on.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.918
Run! Run!

16:24.680 --> 16:27.592
Get out of my inn,
you tattooed miseries!

16:29.680 --> 16:31.989
Can't a woman
get a night's sleep alone?

16:32.080 --> 16:34.036
You come here, you!

16:36.280 --> 16:37.998
This gun is useless!

16:38.080 --> 16:42.198
- You lost all the bullets!
- Well, you're losin' the powder.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.794
The map!
Tell us where it is or die!

16:46.960 --> 16:48.791
- Get them!
- Run! Run, run, run!

16:53.280 --> 16:55.157
Hurry! Hurry!

16:55.240 --> 16:57.356
Hurry!

17:01.640 --> 17:03.756
Outta the way! Outta the way!
Get outta the way!

17:11.520 --> 17:12.999
Stop!

17:14.839 --> 17:17.637
Oh, Woof.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.948
Geronimo!

17:28.040 --> 17:29.109
Guys!

17:29.200 --> 17:30.838
Wow! What an exit!

17:30.920 --> 17:32.751
- Right through a brick wall!
- I am in such pain.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.876
Come on!

17:34.960 --> 17:39.829
I think I smell
something burning, no?

17:39.920 --> 17:42.036
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.754
We can't go home, so--

17:47.160 --> 17:50.869
Oh, no. Uh-uh. No way. You're not
taking me on some crazy treasure hunt.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.679
- I am staying right here!
- Oh, good idea, Rizzo.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.638
Then you can see what half-burned,
vicious pirates look like.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.280
What are we waitin' for?
Gimme that map. Come on. Let's go.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.079
Wait a minute.
What about Mrs Bluveridge?

18:04.200 --> 18:06.555
I'll be fine, boys!
Run for it!

18:08.160 --> 18:10.549
How does she do that?

18:12.160 --> 18:14.071
Who's gonna clean
all this up?

18:16.640 --> 18:18.790
Two for a penny, sir?

18:18.880 --> 18:23.317
- I don't want a baked potato.
- Lovely hot baked potatoes.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.397
- Oh, let's see.
- What a night.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.550
- There it is!
- Huh? Oh.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.753
''Trelawny & Son
Master Ship Builders''

18:39.240 --> 18:41.595
Whoa, whoa!
Reality check here, guys!

18:41.680 --> 18:43.671
Do we actually believe some
bozo's gonna give us a ship...

18:43.760 --> 18:45.591
just because we show him
Captain Bones' map?

18:45.680 --> 18:50.834
- It's worth a try, Rizzo.
- I don't know.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.478
May I help you?

18:52.560 --> 18:56.997
Yes. Thank you. We wish to speak
with Squire Trelawney, the shipbuilder.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.036
- We need a ship.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.317
The squire's in Long Neddry
for the grouse season.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.393
He will return
on the feast of St Lulu.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.431
- Thank you.
- That's that.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.431
Of course, his rich...

19:11.520 --> 19:16.230
half-wit son
young Squire Trelawney's here.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.788
We'll see him, then.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.872
Well, gentlemen...

19:21.960 --> 19:25.748
this is definitely a genuine,
bona fide treasure map.

19:27.080 --> 19:27.990
Really!

19:28.080 --> 19:29.752
Yes. Mr Bimbo told me so.

19:31.720 --> 19:36.396
Oh, Mr Bimbo lives in my finger.
He's very smart. He's been to the moon.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.873
Thank you. Twice.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.350
- I smell a bozo.
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.275
Well done, Beakie.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.920
Now we know that is definitely
too much gunpowder.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.029
Beaker, stop fooling around.
We've got company.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.753
Oh, hello, chappies. Everyone, this is
Dr Livesey and his assistant, Beaker.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.149
They do research
and development for my papa.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.593
Hello.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.830
Actually, Squire, we were
hoping to meet your father.

20:11.920 --> 20:16.152
- We need a ship for an ocean voyage.
- Ocean? Ocean.

20:16.240 --> 20:21.189
- Ocean?
- You know, the ocean?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.795
Oh! Th-The big,
blue, wet thing! Yes!

20:26.800 --> 20:29.030
Say, I know
what's happening here.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.396
You chaps are planning
to sail to this island, aren't you?

20:32.480 --> 20:35.438
- To dig up this treasure.
- Yes, but we must be quiet about it.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.159
- There are pirates
looking for this map.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.470
Isn't that exciting?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.677
Pirates, eh?
Well, that settles it.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.591
We'll use one
of my daddy's boats...

20:45.680 --> 20:49.673
and I will personally finance
the voyage for the treasure myself.

20:49.760 --> 20:54.709
- You'll do that? Really?
- What are rich, half-wit sons for?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.869
Well, here's the dock.
Jim, where's our boat?

21:02.960 --> 21:04.951
We're on a dock?
No wonder I'm seasick.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.679
- Ahoy!
- Ah, morning, Squire.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.196
Welcome. Welcome.
Ah, there she is:

21:11.280 --> 21:13.236
the <i>Hispaniola</i>.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.151
Wow!

21:18.800 --> 21:22.076
- Come on. Let's go!
- Yeah, let's go.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.558
- ''Take a cruise,'' you said.
- Huh?

21:32.640 --> 21:35.108
- ''See the world,'' you said.
- Huh?

21:35.200 --> 21:39.034
Now here we are stuck
on the front of this stupid ship.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.908
Well, it could be worse.
We could be stuck in the audience.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.913
Well, Mr Bimbo...

21:46.000 --> 21:48.150
the ship is provisioned,
the crew is in place...

21:48.240 --> 21:50.879
and the captain should be
on board within the hour.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.871
You have been
a busy little man.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.953
- Oh, look, there goes Jim.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.508
Ooh! Ooh, look!

21:59.600 --> 22:01.511
It's the boat
steering thing.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.511
This is called the helm.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.513
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?

22:07.600 --> 22:09.909
Feels like
we're really doing it.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.958
It feels like we're finally
having an adventure!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.679
Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Where's the kitchen?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.038
<i>Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

22:19.120 --> 22:22.237
- Something smells good.
<i>- Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

22:22.320 --> 22:24.788
- Cool.
<i>- Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

22:24.880 --> 22:28.475
<i>Early in the morning</i>

22:28.560 --> 22:31.472
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>until he's sober</i>

22:31.560 --> 22:34.677
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>till he's sober</i>

22:34.760 --> 22:37.274
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>till he's sober</i>

22:37.360 --> 22:39.191
<i>Early in the morning</i>

22:39.280 --> 22:42.397
What have we here?
Stowaways!

22:42.480 --> 22:46.712
I'm afraid we shish-kebab
and barbecue stowaways on this ship.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.995
Wait. I know.
You must be the cabin boys.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.117
- Yeah.
- Hungry, lads?

23:01.200 --> 23:04.317
Well, in my galley, you're always
welcome to help yourselves!

23:04.400 --> 23:06.709
Yes! Thank you!

23:09.000 --> 23:11.992
Oh, yes!

23:12.080 --> 23:15.152
Well, he's got a healthy appetite.
How about you, funny face?

23:15.240 --> 23:17.071
- Huh?
- Here.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.435
Hey. Thank you.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.909
My name is Gonzo,
and the guy in your chicken is Rizzo.

23:24.880 --> 23:29.112
- And you must be Master Hawkins.
- Yes, sir.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.636
Oh, you needn't be callin'
a lowly ship's cook ''sir.''

23:32.720 --> 23:36.679
Long John Silver,
at your humble service.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.354
We're just cabin boys,
Mr Silver.

23:39.440 --> 23:43.115
Long John to his friends.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.792
And believe me, lad...

23:44.880 --> 23:49.112
a friend you can trust
is worth his weight in gold.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.751
There's many a dark-hearted
scoundrel in these ports.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.831
Well, what do you mean?
Pirates?

23:55.920 --> 23:58.354
- Shh!
- Pirates! That's rich!

23:58.440 --> 24:01.273
Pirates? What an imagination.
Give me a cracker.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.477
Allow me to introduce
my pet lobster Polly.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.710
Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight!

24:06.800 --> 24:08.631
Raised him
from a fingerling, I did.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.156
As fine a crustacean
as a man could ask for.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.198
B-But I thought sailors
had talking parrots as pets.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.430
Talking parrots?

24:17.520 --> 24:21.752
What an imagination.
First pirates, now talking parrots?

24:21.840 --> 24:25.753
What's next? A singing, dancing mouse
with his own amusement park?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.876
That's enough now, Polly.
Go on! Shoo!

24:30.960 --> 24:34.953
Right, me hearties. I'm gonna give you
a cook's tour of this fine ship.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.395
If you're gonna be the cook
on this ship, Mr Silver...

24:37.480 --> 24:39.835
I am definitely gonna need
bigger pants.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.471
What's the matter, lads?

24:51.600 --> 24:53.079
Oh, that?

24:53.160 --> 24:58.359
Lost that timber-fighting brigands
off Madagascar under Admiral Hawke.

24:58.440 --> 25:02.399
There's many a man lost a leg and worse
in the service of the king.

25:02.480 --> 25:07.031
Why, look what a cannibal
took off me...

25:07.120 --> 25:09.759
in exchange for me own life.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.715
Oh, you're a fine pair, lads.
That you are.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.917
Bright as buttons,
the lot of ye.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.798
- All hands on deck!
- Come on, then, lads.

25:27.120 --> 25:31.033
Chop-chop! Look lively now.
The captain will be here soon.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.792
Chop-chop.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.916
- Who's that?
- That is Mr Arrow, the first mate,

25:42.960 --> 25:45.793
The captain approaches.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.560
Move aside! Make way!
Make ready for the captain!

25:52.640 --> 25:54.676
Lollygaggers will suffer
his wrath!

25:54.760 --> 25:56.591
Wrath? I-Is this captain
bad-tempered?

25:56.680 --> 26:00.593
Is he bad-tempered?
The man is a raging volcano...

26:00.680 --> 26:04.434
tormented by inner demons the likes
of which mere mortals cannot fathom.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.556
He's got demons? Cool!

26:18.920 --> 26:20.831
Maniac!

26:43.720 --> 26:46.029
Heigh-ho, everyone.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.634
- What-- That--
- That's the raging volcano?

26:48.720 --> 26:52.474
- He's a frog.
- Maybe he gets hopping mad.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.471
Hopping mad.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.590
Piping aboard
Captain Abraham Smollett.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.351
Good day, Mr Arrow.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.557
I knew it.
He's furious.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.551
- Ah, you there!
- Me?

27:18.640 --> 27:21.916
You were in charge of railing dust.
Thirty lashes, and then

27:22.680 --> 27:27.879
- I didn't say that, Mr Arrow.
- I was anticipating your whim, sir.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.997
Oh. You must be
the cabin boys.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.230
- Yes, sir!
- Which one of you is Hawkins?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.151
I am, sir.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.390
I knew your father,Jim.
He was a good man.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.948
Thank you, sir.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.511
Well, this is shapin' up
to be a fine voyage, lads.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.068
Oh, yes, indeed.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.480
One leg,Jim.
Count 'em. One.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.348
- Remember what Billy Bones said.
- Oh, Gonzo, he seems all right.

27:56.440 --> 28:00.319
I mean, Long John's only a cook.
How dangerous could he be?

28:00.400 --> 28:03.198
Well, I don't know, but I--
Wait a minute. Where's Rizzo?

28:03.280 --> 28:06.238
Enjoy your cruise, sir.
Next!

28:06.320 --> 28:09.869
All right, folks, have your cheques
made out to ''Rat Tours Limited.''

28:09.960 --> 28:13.077
Remember, we put
the rat in ''pirate.''

28:14.520 --> 28:16.431
Why, thank you,
Mr Plagueman. Next!

28:16.520 --> 28:19.671
- Rizzo, what are you doing?
- What? Oh, this.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.591
Well, I figure
if the treasure map's a dud...

28:21.680 --> 28:25.639
the trip won't be a total loss,
financially speaking.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.110
Well, the wind seems to be freshening.
The tide is with us.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.033
Mr Arrow,
this voyage has begun.

28:32.120 --> 28:36.318
This voyage has begun!
Raise the gangplank!

28:36.400 --> 28:38.834
- Right, lads!
- Let go forward line!

28:38.920 --> 28:42.390
Let go aft line.
Hard to starboard.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.119
Any man caught dawdling
will be shot on sight.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.156
- I didn't say that.
- I was just paraphrasing.

28:47.240 --> 28:51.836
- Mr Arrow, just set the sails.
- Set the sails!

28:52.880 --> 28:54.791
Hey, where's my camera?

28:54.880 --> 28:58.395
- I'll miss you! I said I'll miss you!
- We'll send postcards!

28:58.480 --> 29:00.675
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

29:07.920 --> 29:10.480
<i>When the course is laid</i>
<i>and the anchor's weighed</i>

29:10.560 --> 29:13.028
<i>A sailor's blood</i>
<i>begins racing</i>

29:13.120 --> 29:15.953
<i>With our hearts unbound</i>
<i>and our flag unfurled</i>

29:16.040 --> 29:18.793
<i>We're underway and off</i>
<i>to see the world</i>

29:18.880 --> 29:21.269
<i>Underway and off</i>
<i>to see the world</i>

29:21.360 --> 29:23.669
<i>Heave ho, we'll go</i>

29:23.760 --> 29:26.558
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>
<i>is blowing</i>

29:26.640 --> 29:30.235
<i>Manly men are we</i>

29:30.320 --> 29:33.198
<i>Sailing for adventure</i>
<i>on the deep blue sea</i>

29:33.280 --> 29:38.035
Safely now, Mr Silver. Let's not
get sloppy just because we're singing.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.032
- Aye, aye, sir.
<i>- Danger walks on deck</i>

29:41.120 --> 29:43.350
<i>We laugh at the perils</i>
<i>we're facing</i>

29:43.440 --> 29:46.193
<i>Every storm we ride</i>
<i>is its own reward</i>

29:46.280 --> 29:48.953
<i>And people die</i>
<i>by fallin'overboard</i>

29:49.040 --> 29:51.600
<i>People die</i>
<i>by falling overboard</i>

29:51.680 --> 29:54.558
<i>Heigh ho, we'll go</i>

29:54.640 --> 29:57.108
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>
<i>is blowing</i>

29:57.200 --> 30:01.113
<i>Hoist the sails and sing</i>

30:01.200 --> 30:05.512
<i>Sailing for adventure</i>
<i>on the big, blue, wet thing</i>

30:05.600 --> 30:09.275
<i>I love to see 'em cry</i>
<i>when they walk the plank</i>

30:09.360 --> 30:13.194
<i>I prefer to cut a throat</i>

30:13.280 --> 30:15.840
<i>I love to hang 'em high</i>
<i>and watch their little feet</i>

30:15.920 --> 30:19.276
<i>Try to walk in the air</i>
<i>while their faces turn blue</i>

30:19.360 --> 30:21.191
Just kidding.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.350
<i>It's a good life on a boat</i>

30:23.440 --> 30:26.000
<i>There are distant lands</i>
<i>with burning sands</i>

30:26.080 --> 30:28.640
<i>That call across the oceans</i>

30:28.720 --> 30:31.518
<i>There are bingo games</i>
<i>every fun-filled day</i>

30:31.600 --> 30:34.239
<i>And margaritas</i>
<i>at the midnight buffet</i>

30:34.320 --> 30:36.914
<i>Margaritas</i>
<i>at the midnight buffet</i>

30:37.000 --> 30:39.673
<i>Heigh ho, we'll go</i>

30:39.760 --> 30:42.399
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>
<i>is blowing</i>

30:42.480 --> 30:45.916
<i>Should have took a train</i>

30:46.000 --> 30:48.719
<i>Sailing for adventure</i>
<i>on the bounding main</i>

30:48.800 --> 30:51.109
<i>The salty breezes whisper</i>

30:51.200 --> 30:53.839
<i>Who knows what lies ahead</i>

30:53.920 --> 30:56.480
<i>I just know</i>
<i>I was born to lead</i>

30:56.560 --> 30:59.358
<i>The life my father led</i>

30:59.440 --> 31:01.908
<i>The stars will be</i>
<i>our compass</i>

31:02.000 --> 31:04.309
<i>Wherever we may roam</i>

31:04.400 --> 31:07.119
<i>And our mates</i>
<i>will always be</i>

31:07.200 --> 31:09.589
<i>Just like a family</i>

31:09.680 --> 31:12.797
<i>And though we may</i>
<i>put into port</i>

31:12.880 --> 31:15.917
<i>The sea is always home</i>

31:16.000 --> 31:20.869
All right, Mr Bimbo. I didn't know
you had such a good singing voice.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.474
<i>We'll chase our dreams</i>
<i>standing on our own</i>

31:23.560 --> 31:26.393
<i>Over the horizon</i>
<i>to the great unknown</i>

31:26.480 --> 31:29.040
<i>Heigh ho, we'll go</i>

31:29.120 --> 31:31.759
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>
<i>is blowing</i>

31:31.840 --> 31:35.674
<i>Bold and brave and free</i>

31:35.760 --> 31:38.069
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- It's so nauseating!

31:38.160 --> 31:40.799
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- So exhilarating!

31:40.880 --> 31:43.599
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- We're all celebrating!

31:43.680 --> 31:48.879
<i>On the deep blue sea</i>

31:50.640 --> 31:51.834
Ahoy!

31:55.840 --> 31:57.319
Roll call!

32:00.440 --> 32:02.635
- Long John Silver?
- Aye, aye, sir!

32:02.720 --> 32:05.154
- Short Stack Stevens?
- Aye!

32:05.240 --> 32:06.992
- One-Eyed Jack?
- Aye!

32:07.080 --> 32:09.150
- Black-Eyed Pea.
- Yeah.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.037
- Walleyed Pike.
- Aye.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.111
Polly Lobster.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.509
- Mad Monty.
- Aye.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.398
- Sweetums.
- Aye.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.431
- Old Tom.
- Aye, aye.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.794
- Real Old Tom.
- Aye.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.838
- Dead Tom?
- Aye, aye.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.992
Cool.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.991
- Clueless Morgan?
- Huh?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.071
Headless Bill.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.628
Headless Bill.

32:41.200 --> 32:45.432
Big-Fat-Ugly-Bug-Face-
Baby-Eating O'Brien?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.873
Aye.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.873
- Angel Marie.
- Aye, aye.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.597
Gentlemen, may I see you
in my cabin?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.750
- Immediately?
- Mm-hmm.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.718
Who hired this crew? This is
undoubtedly the seediest bunch...

33:06.800 --> 33:08.870
of cutthroats, villains
and scoundrels I have ever seen!

33:08.960 --> 33:11.030
So who hired 'em?

33:17.040 --> 33:18.871
Your finger hired the crew?

33:18.960 --> 33:24.159
No, that's silly. The man who lives
in my finger hired the crew: Mr Bimbo.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.196
What? Ah!

33:26.280 --> 33:30.239
Yeah, he relied heavily on the advice
of our excellent cook, Long John Silver.

33:31.560 --> 33:35.030
A cook? And a guy who lives
in a bear's finger?

33:35.120 --> 33:36.997
Exactly!

33:38.960 --> 33:40.871
I'm starting to worry
about this voyage.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.713
Jim, I know Billy Bones
gave you the treasure map...

33:43.800 --> 33:46.633
but I hope you'll give it
to me for safekeeping.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.314
I'll be careful with it, sir.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.516
Beggin' your pardon,
gentlemen...

33:58.600 --> 34:00.955
but I've come with a bit
of a treat for you.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.077
'Tis my very own best brandy...

34:04.160 --> 34:07.311
laid down by the brothers
of Buckfast Abbey...

34:07.400 --> 34:10.233
vintage 1 737...

34:10.320 --> 34:13.232
to toast
to a prosperous voyage.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.312
- Oh, spiffy.
- I'm sorry, Mr Silver, but I'm not...

34:16.400 --> 34:19.039
going to allow drinking
on this voyage.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.078
- Oh, well, rules are rules.
- Oh, but, sir...

34:22.159 --> 34:25.436
'tis a tradition for the officers
to toast to the success of a voyage.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.998
Ah, very true.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.877
No, we must set an example
for this questionable crew.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.996
There will be no consumption
of alcohol of any kind.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.594
Oh, sir, but I can vouch
for this crew myself.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.478
You could sail to heaven
and back with these men.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.790
Well, I'm afraid
I must disagree with you.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.393
Oh.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.630
You wanna knock it off
with the booze?

34:44.719 --> 34:47.188
It's peeling the paint
off of the shuffleboard court.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.748
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.831
And that's that.
This conversation is finished.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.956
I understand, sir.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.952
I shall tend to my duty
and see to it...

34:57.040 --> 35:01.113
that every drop of alcohol
is thrown overboard.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.636
Come on,Jim.
Don't bother, Captain.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.188
You can go
if you want to,Jim.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.111
- Come on.
- Yeah.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.271
Oh, well. I guess the human beings
wanna hang out together...

35:13.360 --> 35:15.271
don't wanna spend time
with a rat and a, uh--

35:15.360 --> 35:17.669
- Uh, uh, whatever.
- Yeah.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.870
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

35:30.960 --> 35:33.110
Oh, that's great.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.111
Cute couple.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.232
Stop it!

35:44.320 --> 35:46.709
I never felt
like this before.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.631
- Denise, what I'm trying to say--
- Yes?

35:48.720 --> 35:50.551
- What I'm trying to say is--
- Yes?

35:50.640 --> 35:52.471
- What I mean to say is, I--
- Yes?

35:59.760 --> 36:02.228
I'm sorry your present
didn't work out.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.995
Oh,Jim, Smollett sails
by rules and laws.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.719
That's what bein' a captain's
all about.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.711
Me, I sails by the stars.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.593
Stars?

36:14.680 --> 36:18.355
North,Jim. Find me north out there
among them stars.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.396
Well, that's easy.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.391
Ah, yeah, but what
if you don't have a compass?

36:22.480 --> 36:24.789
Long John, please don't drop it.
It was my father's.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.711
It's all I have of his.
Please. Please.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.830
I'm sorry, lad.
I were only foolin'.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.714
- How old were you when he died, then?
- Seven.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.519
I were eight
when my father died at sea.

36:45.600 --> 36:50.071
- First mate, he was.
- My father was a first mate too.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.515
Was he, now?

36:52.600 --> 36:55.672
By the powers.
What a coincidence.

36:57.520 --> 37:02.799
Now,Jim, that be Polaris,
the North Star.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.395
Even in the China Sea,
that's north.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.948
- North. Polaris.
- Uh-huh.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.794
- So we must be heading southwest.
- Smart as paint you are, lad.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.599
Smart as paint.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.956
Now, that gets old Long John
to wonderin'.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.990
Why would we be
sailin' southwest?

37:26.560 --> 37:29.518
The scuttlebutt
among the crew is that, uh...

37:29.600 --> 37:31.670
we're sailin'
for buried treasure...

37:31.760 --> 37:34.877
and, uh, someone on board...

37:34.960 --> 37:36.871
has a map.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.278
'Course,
none of my concern,Jim.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.669
I'm just a ship's cook.

37:47.760 --> 37:51.673
Such matters are best suited
to Captain Smollett.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.877
Come on, Long John.
You could captain this ship.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.918
That I could, lad.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.150
Maybe someday I will.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.031
- Moonlight swim?
- Okay.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.995
Oh, Smolly, my love for you...

38:26.080 --> 38:28.640
is deeper than
the deep, blue sea.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.839
Get on with you! Go on!

39:12.920 --> 39:13.989
Hi,Jim!

39:14.080 --> 39:18.358
- Yo,Jimbo! Mornin', Long--
- Hi, Long John. Good morning.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.954
Well, at least one of us
is having a good time.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.396
Ah, Rizzo, it's not so bad.
Angel Marie said that later on...

39:24.480 --> 39:28.314
he'd throw a line out the back
and let me drag along the bottom.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.949
I don't know about this crew.
I feel like they're always

39:32.040 --> 39:34.235
That's just a figment
of your imagination.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.790
This is a figment
of my imagination?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.996
Now, tell us
where the map is...

39:44.080 --> 39:46.355
or we'll tear ya
limb from limb!

39:46.440 --> 39:48.715
Never. My friend
and I will never tell.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.360
Hey, hey, there could be
extenuatin' circumstances.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.715
I mean, you know--
Wh-- I b-- If--

39:53.800 --> 39:55.677
Maybe they'll ask
real nice.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.591
- In your dreams!
- Do it, Monty! Do it!

39:57.680 --> 39:59.989
Yeah, do it to me!

40:03.840 --> 40:05.751
Yes! More!

40:05.840 --> 40:08.798
- Oh, no, I can't look.
- Look at this!

40:08.880 --> 40:11.155
I'm taller!
This is so cool!

40:11.240 --> 40:14.357
I may even have a future
with the NBA.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.432
This won't work! He likes it!
Let's torture the rat!

40:17.520 --> 40:19.511
- Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah!

40:19.600 --> 40:22.433
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.557
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, please, no! I hate basketball!

40:25.640 --> 40:29.918
I got a lovely recipe
for blackened rat.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.834
I say!
This does not look safe!

40:39.600 --> 40:42.398
- What? What? What? What?
- I b-- I burned my hand.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.152
Kiss it or something!

40:48.720 --> 40:51.518
Poodly, poodly, poodly,
poodly, poodly.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.558
Mr Arrow, lock those three up
for the remainder of the voyage.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.471
- Yes, sir!
- You can't hold us!

40:56.560 --> 40:59.518
- To the brig! Move along!
- Will you stop crying!

40:59.600 --> 41:03.639
- Move along.
- Oh, good. That's good. Yeah.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.393
Master Hawkins, may I see you
in my cabin, please?

41:06.480 --> 41:09.278
Yes, sir.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.828
- Ready, Mr Gonzo?
- Ready!

41:11.920 --> 41:13.911
Tie off the rope, Beaker!

41:14.000 --> 41:18.516
We call this
the window shade cure.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.909
All right.
Snip, snip, snip.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.148
Oh, great! Wow!

41:30.720 --> 41:33.029
That was so cool!

41:33.120 --> 41:35.509
Hmm? Oh, sure.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.238
- Who's the lady pig, sir?
- Never mind that,Jim. Listen.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.756
I'm hoping you're willing
to give me the map now,

41:45.840 --> 41:47.751
I'd rather not, sir.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.511
I'd hoped it wouldn't
come to this,Jim, but...

41:51.600 --> 41:53.591
as captain, I order you
to give me the map.

42:01.040 --> 42:04.316
- Mr Arrow?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.436
Lock up this treasure map.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.549
It will be safe
in here, sir.

42:45.880 --> 42:50.112
It's been six weeks
since we left England.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.474
Five days
since we had a breeze.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.471
No!

43:05.560 --> 43:07.073
I got the madness!

43:08.040 --> 43:09.632
I got cabin fever!

43:09.720 --> 43:12.439
I've got it too!

43:12.520 --> 43:15.318
Cabin fever!

43:15.400 --> 43:18.870
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>It's burning in my brain</i>

43:18.960 --> 43:22.589
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>It's driving me insane</i>

43:22.680 --> 43:26.355
<i>We got cabin fever</i>
<i>We're flipping our bandannas</i>

43:26.440 --> 43:29.750
<i>Been stuck at sea so long</i>
<i>that we have simply gone bananas</i>

43:36.280 --> 43:38.919
<i>We, we, we got cabin fever</i>

43:39.000 --> 43:40.956
<i>We lost what sense we had</i>

43:41.040 --> 43:44.350
<i>We got cabin fever</i>
<i>We're all going mad</i>

43:44.440 --> 43:48.035
<i>Grab your partner by the ears</i>
<i>Lash him to the wheel</i>

43:48.120 --> 43:51.351
<i>Do-si-do, step on his toe</i>
<i>Listen to him squeal</i>

43:51.440 --> 43:53.476
<i>Allemande left</i>
<i>Allemande right</i>

43:53.560 --> 43:55.630
<i>It's time to sail or sink</i>

43:55.720 --> 43:57.631
<i>Swing your partner</i>
<i>over the side</i>

43:57.720 --> 44:00.678
<i>- Drop him in the drink</i>
- We've got cabin fever.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.513
- No ifs, ands or buts.
- We're disoriented.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.955
- And demented.
- And a little nuts.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.993
<i>Volkswagen car</i>

44:13.040 --> 44:15.156
<i>We were sailing, sailing</i>

44:15.240 --> 44:17.151
<i>The wind was on our side</i>

44:19.000 --> 44:20.831
And then it died.

44:20.920 --> 44:24.037
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>I think I lost my grip</i>

44:24.120 --> 44:28.159
<i>I'd like to get my hands</i>
<i>on whoever wrote this script</i>

44:28.240 --> 44:33.473
<i>I was floating</i>
<i>'neath the tropic moon</i>

44:33.560 --> 44:36.996
<i>And dreaming</i>
<i>of a blue lagoon</i>

44:37.080 --> 44:40.356
<i>Now I'm as crazy as a loon</i>

44:40.440 --> 44:44.115
<i>Cabin fever</i>
<i>has ravaged all aboard</i>

44:44.200 --> 44:47.397
<i>This one small vessel</i>
<i>has become a floating psycho ward</i>

44:47.480 --> 44:51.234
<i>We were sailing, sailing</i>
<i>heading who knows where</i>

44:51.320 --> 44:54.118
<i>And now though</i>
<i>we're all here</i>

44:54.200 --> 44:57.237
<i>We're not all there</i>

45:05.400 --> 45:07.755
Cabin fever!

45:08.760 --> 45:09.795
- The wind is back.
- What are we doing?

45:09.880 --> 45:12.189
What's goin' on here?

45:12.280 --> 45:14.589
- What was that?
- I feel like such a fool.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.116
- Yeah, me too.
- I hope nobody saw that. Embarrassing.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.111
- Get us outta here! Help!
- We didn't hit him!

45:20.200 --> 45:22.760
Come on. Let us out.
We was only joking.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.398
- Hey, Long John!
Hey, get us outta here!

45:27.480 --> 45:29.311
- Hey-ey-ey, Polly.
- What?

45:29.400 --> 45:32.676
- What was that song that just happened?
- What are you talkin' about?

45:32.760 --> 45:35.832
You know.
<i>Cabin Fever</i>

45:35.920 --> 45:38.912
- That.
- You see,John?

45:39.000 --> 45:42.117
You gotta get us outta here now!
Clueless is startin' to go crackers!

45:44.240 --> 45:46.071
Here you go.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.789
- Your bread and water for today.
- But I ordered shrimp scampi.

45:49.880 --> 45:53.668
It's more than you deserve,
ya villainous dogs!

45:53.760 --> 45:55.352
Oh,Jim.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.193
By rights,
I should be locked up too...

45:58.280 --> 46:00.999
for lettin' thieves like them
aboard this ship.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.230
Oh, it chills me...

46:03.320 --> 46:06.118
to think that they almost
killed your little friends...

46:06.200 --> 46:08.350
looking for some
daft treasure map.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.752
None of this would've happened if I'd
have given Captain Smollet the--

46:15.320 --> 46:17.390
What, lad?

46:17.480 --> 46:20.631
I'm not really sure I should be talking
about this with you or with anyone.

46:20.720 --> 46:25.396
You mean, you've really
got a treasure map?

46:25.480 --> 46:29.155
Not any more. Mr Arrow took it and
locked it up in the captain's cabin.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.071
You must promise
to keep it a secret.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.233
Don't bother your head about that.
You've only told old Long John.

46:35.320 --> 46:37.595
Now, you run along
and do your chores. Go on.

46:37.680 --> 46:39.557
Go on.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.716
Safely now. Safely.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.271
Steady as she goes.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.839
Oh. Mr Silver, good evening.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.195
Wicked fog tonight, sir.

47:18.280 --> 47:21.431
Reminds me of the night
we ran aground off the pampas.

47:21.520 --> 47:24.080
Half the crew drowned
in leaky lifeboats.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.991
Ah, it were
a terrible shame.

47:26.080 --> 47:29.231
- Leaky lifeboats?
- Oh, a common occurrence, sir.

47:29.320 --> 47:32.312
A little-used piece of equipment
falls into disrepair...

47:32.400 --> 47:36.359
- and becomes, shall we say--
- Unsafe?

47:36.440 --> 47:40.035
Oh, I'm not sayin'
our lifeboats are unsafe, sir.

47:40.120 --> 47:44.113
I'm not sayin'
we got problems--

47:44.200 --> 47:45.633
Still--

47:47.640 --> 47:48.709
Hmm. Hmm.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.998
The caulking appears tight.
No dampness under the gunwale.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.877
This one seems seaworthy.

47:54.960 --> 47:59.272
Well, sir, they do, of course, until
you get them out in the open ocean.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.189
- Cast me off, Mr Silver.
- Oh, yes, sir.

48:03.280 --> 48:08.513
Oh, sir, is there anything I can
hold for you for safekeeping?

48:08.600 --> 48:11.114
Your hat? Your coat?

48:11.200 --> 48:14.590
- Your keys?
- Hmm? My keys?

48:14.680 --> 48:19.674
Of course. If they were to fall
overboard, it would be disastrous.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.558
Oh, that it would, sir.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.638
Cast me off, Mr Silver!

48:26.720 --> 48:28.199
Aye, aye, sir!

48:29.360 --> 48:31.476
Thank you, Mr Silver.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.915
Just doin' my duty, sir.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.958
Oh, yes,John.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.638
Man overboard!

48:49.160 --> 48:50.070
Yes.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.991
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Wha--

48:52.080 --> 48:54.833
Mr Arrow's gone overboard,
and...

48:54.920 --> 48:57.388
all we found was his hat!

48:57.480 --> 48:59.198
Oh, no.

49:05.560 --> 49:10.395
And so, my friends, the sea has claimed
another loyal officer and friend.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.391
- This was a person who served--
- I got it! I got it!

49:12.480 --> 49:14.391
Okay, after you, Monty.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.119
- No, after you.
- Will you just come on.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.668
Mr Samuel Arrow,
a wonderful man who...

49:19.760 --> 49:22.718
used to get us up from our beds
before dawn for a good flossing.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.434
- Okay, okay. Now, spread out
and find the map.

49:27.520 --> 49:32.071
May the wind be ever at your back,
Samuel Arrow. Rest in peace, my friend.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.720
- Amen.
- Amen.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.236
Shh.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.189
- See? See?
- Wait. Open it. Open it.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.875
No, no, no, we gotta take it
to Long John. Come on.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.151
This apple has a worm in it.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.357
That's not a worm.
That's my tail.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.351
What's wrong?

50:02.440 --> 50:06.149
- It just feels so weird.
- You mean, that Mr Arrow's dead?

50:06.240 --> 50:10.916
Yeah, that, and my pants
are filled with starfish.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.070
You and your hobbies!

50:13.160 --> 50:15.355
Rizzo!

50:15.440 --> 50:18.716
-Jim, we've missed you! Climb in!
- Can't. I'm doing my chores.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.997
- Oh, come on. Share an apple.
- Yeah, come on!

50:25.440 --> 50:29.752
- Anyway, here's the plan.
- I say we should kill that captain now.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.389
- And then we'll get
that twit of a bear!

50:34.480 --> 50:36.391
Oh, hi, Long John.

50:38.480 --> 50:43.349
I'm an easy man.
A gentlemen of fortune, says most.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.637
But it makes me sick at heart
to sail with the likes of you.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.070
Now, get this straight.

50:50.160 --> 50:53.277
If anyone mutinies
before I says so...

50:53.360 --> 50:57.433
I'll throw you overboard
like I did that scurvy mate Mr Arrow!

50:57.520 --> 51:02.230
I says, let the captain
steer us closer to the island.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.231
I've got the lad's
treasure map now.

51:04.320 --> 51:06.550
When the time is ripe,
we'll kill 'em all!

51:06.640 --> 51:10.599
- That's what I said!
- That's what I said!

51:10.680 --> 51:14.070
- Land ho!
- Come on, lads! Let's go!

51:14.160 --> 51:16.071
Yea! Land ho!

51:19.680 --> 51:22.558
Oh, my goodness.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.318
Land ho!

51:28.720 --> 51:30.597
Beachfront property!

51:30.680 --> 51:32.511
Retirement estates!

51:32.600 --> 51:34.158
- Bikinis!
- Bikinis!

51:35.200 --> 51:37.839
Throw the mainsail!
Drop anchor!

51:37.920 --> 51:40.832
Bring her up
hard of starboard, helmsman.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.556
Bring those barrels
over here, lads!

51:51.800 --> 51:53.791
Helmsman, give a hand
with the longboats.

51:53.880 --> 51:56.189
- Captain, may I speak with you?
- I'm sort of busy right now,Jim.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.875
But, Captain, we just heard.
Long John is planning a mutiny,

51:59.960 --> 52:01.951
- Yeah.
- I see.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.634
- Mr Silver?
- Aye, aye, Cap'n!

52:04.720 --> 52:06.995
Mr Silver, I want you
to take the crew ashore at once.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.594
We need water and provisions.
Take as long as you want.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.637
Sir! 'Tis a task to my liking, sir.
That it is!

52:14.720 --> 52:18.110
- Quickly, boys. Gather the officers
and meet me in my quarters. Quickly.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.550
This is a lucky break.
Captain lettin' us go ashore.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.517
Us with the map and all.

52:23.600 --> 52:26.273
It's like giving the treasure to us
on a silver platter.

52:26.360 --> 52:31.036
Aye, that it is, Polly.
Never trust a silver platter.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.437
Follow me, Beakie. Come along.

52:39.160 --> 52:40.229
Jim, lad!

52:40.320 --> 52:44.154
There's room in the boat for one more.
Come along for an adventure.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.516
- I-I can't. The captain wants me.
- Oh, what a shame!

52:47.600 --> 52:49.955
I'll miss you, lad.
That I will.

52:50.040 --> 52:54.636
Um,Jim! I seem to have
left my crutch on board.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.790
Hand it to me like
a good lad, will ya?

52:59.920 --> 53:01.399
There's a good boy.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.998
Have to be a bit closer than that.
Can't reach it from there.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.830
- Oh!
- Oh! Ah!

53:08.920 --> 53:11.036
Cast away, men!
Be quick now!

53:11.120 --> 53:13.270
Go, go, go!
Don't splash!

53:16.080 --> 53:17.354
The plan is simple.

53:17.440 --> 53:20.512
Once the pirates are ashore,
we set sail and return in a year or so.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.672
- By then, all the fight
should be out of'em.

53:23.760 --> 53:24.988
That's a brilliant plan.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.036
- Except for one thing.
- What's that?

53:27.120 --> 53:29.680
The pirates have Jim!

53:45.400 --> 53:46.594
I'm tired!

53:46.680 --> 53:48.272
- You're what?
- I'm gettin' tired!

53:48.360 --> 53:51.830
- He says go faster.
- I'm gettin' tired!

54:05.600 --> 54:08.353
Hey, man! I can't figure out
what side we're on.

54:08.440 --> 54:11.079
Are we with the pirates
or the frog captain?

54:11.160 --> 54:13.151
Oh, hey, man,
just play the gig.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.356
Never get involved in politics.

54:15.440 --> 54:17.715
Politics!
Politics!

54:26.520 --> 54:28.033
Jim, lad!

54:35.520 --> 54:39.513
Easy,Jim.
'Tis all in good fun.

54:39.600 --> 54:44.230
Pleased I am to initiate you
into our enterprising, um, company.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.675
Which entitles you
to all the benefits thereof.

54:48.760 --> 54:54.232
- But I don't want any benefits.
- This is a one-time

54:54.320 --> 54:58.950
Say no, and I will be forced
to, um, terminate our relationship.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.268
- You're nothing but murdering pirates.
- Pirates!

55:07.720 --> 55:10.314
Pirates. Oh,Jim.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.630
If that's what
you're thinking...

55:13.720 --> 55:15.392
you're dead wrong.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.077
<i>When I was just a lad</i>

55:19.160 --> 55:21.594
<i>Looking for my true vocation</i>

55:21.680 --> 55:23.875
<i>My father said</i>
<i>Now, son, this choice</i>

55:23.960 --> 55:26.315
<i>Deserves deliberation</i>

55:26.400 --> 55:28.470
<i>Though you could be a doctor</i>

55:28.560 --> 55:30.949
<i>Or perhaps a financier</i>

55:31.040 --> 55:35.352
<i>My boy, why not consider</i>
<i>a more challenging career</i>

55:35.440 --> 55:36.793
<i>Hey, ho, ho</i>

55:36.880 --> 55:39.235
- <i>You'll cruise to foreign shores</i>
- Sing it, lads!

55:39.320 --> 55:42.915
<i>-And you'll keep your mind and body</i>
<i>sound by working out of doors</i>

55:43.000 --> 55:46.549
<i>True friendship and adventure</i>
<i>are what we can't live without</i>

55:46.640 --> 55:52.078
<i>-And when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

55:52.160 --> 55:56.950
Upstage, lads!
This is my only number.

55:57.040 --> 56:01.431
<i>Now take Sir Francis Drake</i>
<i>The Spanish all despise him</i>

56:01.520 --> 56:06.310
<i>But to the British he's a hero</i>
<i>and they idolize him</i>

56:06.400 --> 56:08.595
<i>It's how you look at buccaneers</i>

56:08.680 --> 56:10.591
<i>That makes them bad or good</i>

56:10.680 --> 56:14.514
<i>And I see us as members</i>
<i>of a noble brotherhood</i>

56:14.600 --> 56:16.352
- Hup!
- <i>Hey, ho, ho</i>

56:16.440 --> 56:19.159
- Oh, I love it!
- <i>We're honourable men</i>

56:19.240 --> 56:22.550
<i>And before we lose our tempers</i>
<i>we will always count to ten</i>

56:22.640 --> 56:26.394
<i>On occasion there may be</i>
<i>someone you have to execute</i>

56:26.480 --> 56:30.393
<i>But when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

56:30.480 --> 56:32.471
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to wear a suit</i>

56:33.760 --> 56:38.436
- What?
<i>- I could have been a surgeon</i>

56:38.520 --> 56:42.433
<i>I could have been a lawyer</i>
<i>but I just had too much heart</i>

56:42.520 --> 56:45.318
<i>I could have been in politics</i>

56:45.400 --> 56:49.439
<i>'Cause I've always been</i>
<i>a big spender</i>

56:49.520 --> 56:53.559
<i>And me, I could have been</i>
<i>a contender</i>

56:56.360 --> 56:58.635
<i>Some say that pirates steal</i>

56:58.720 --> 57:01.280
<i>And should be feared and hated</i>

57:01.360 --> 57:03.669
<i>I say we're victims</i>
<i>of bad press</i>

57:03.760 --> 57:05.910
<i>It's all exaggerated</i>

57:06.000 --> 57:08.355
<i>We'd never stab you</i>
<i>in the back</i>

57:08.440 --> 57:10.556
<i>We'd never lie or cheat</i>

57:10.640 --> 57:12.790
<i>We'rejust about the nicest guys</i>

57:12.880 --> 57:15.110
<i>You'd ever want to meet</i>

57:15.200 --> 57:17.156
Well, look at us,Jim.

57:17.240 --> 57:19.959
We're a festival
of conviviality.

57:22.200 --> 57:22.916
Congeniality.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.913
- That's conviviality, stupid.
- That's what I said.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.558
We're ready, O <i>capitán</i>.

57:28.640 --> 57:32.519
Good. You men guard the ship
while I'm gone. We'll be back

57:32.600 --> 57:34.716
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Cast off, Mr Beaker.

57:36.920 --> 57:39.309
Thanks for coming along, men.

57:39.400 --> 57:42.472
- Are you kidding? Jim is family.
- Yeah.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.636
Tell the truth, lad.

57:45.720 --> 57:47.950
Do you really think the captain
and the squire...

57:48.040 --> 57:50.713
are planning to share the treasure
with the likes of us?

57:52.040 --> 57:53.758
Can't hear ya.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.558
No?

57:55.640 --> 57:57.949
And we being
the rightful owners.

57:58.040 --> 58:02.670
Flint's own crew, who shed
our blood getting it here!

58:05.080 --> 58:06.718
Join us, lad.

58:06.800 --> 58:10.349
Donate your compass to the
treasure hunt and get a full share!

58:12.520 --> 58:16.115
<i>Hey, ho, ho</i>
<i>It's one for all for one</i>

58:16.200 --> 58:18.395
<i>And we'll share</i>
<i>and share alike with you</i>

58:18.480 --> 58:20.277
<i>And love you like a son</i>

58:20.360 --> 58:23.875
<i>We're gentlemen of fortune</i>
<i>and that's what we're proud to be</i>

58:23.960 --> 58:27.270
<i>And when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

58:27.360 --> 58:29.794
<i>You'll be honest</i>
<i>brave and free</i>

58:29.880 --> 58:31.677
<i>The soul of decency</i>

58:31.760 --> 58:33.671
<i>You'll be loyal and fair</i>
<i>and on the square</i>

58:33.760 --> 58:35.716
<i>And most importantly</i>

58:35.800 --> 58:39.190
<i>When you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

58:39.280 --> 58:41.999
<i>You're always in the best</i>

58:42.080 --> 58:47.598
<i>Of company</i>

58:52.920 --> 58:56.833
- Down!
- There! Captain Smollett

58:56.920 --> 58:58.831
Don't get your hopes up, laddie.

58:58.920 --> 59:02.708
I've taken the liberty of hiding
a few of my best men aboard.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.597
If a second round follows...

59:04.680 --> 59:07.035
it means they've
taken over the <i>Hispaniola</i>...

59:07.120 --> 59:09.509
and I'm the new cap'n.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.996
Now, then.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.991
Yea!

59:24.280 --> 59:27.238
How infortuitous our firearms
weren't loaded, Beakie.

59:27.320 --> 59:30.357
I'll say.
We might have shot somebody.

59:33.520 --> 59:35.795
I'm the only friend
you got in the world now,Jim.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.230
Let's dig up
the treasure together, eh?

59:39.320 --> 59:41.834
Shipmates, remember?

59:43.800 --> 59:48.271
- We'll be needing your compass, though.
- No.

59:48.360 --> 59:50.430
I'll be taking it
either way,Jim.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.553
Yea!

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.791
Come on then, lad.
Let's not waste time.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.989
Well, it's too dark
to do anything now.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.878
We'll camp here
and wait for first light.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.430
Oh. Hey, Rizzo, relax!
Don't be so afraid.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.829
Oh, I've gone
way beyond afraid.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.117
Right now I'm somewhere between
bed-wetting and a near-death experience.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.074
- Good night, boys.
- Well, good night.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.355
- 'Night, Rizzo.
- Yeah, sure.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.236
Gonzo?
Is that you, Gonzo?

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.353
Boy, Gonzo, it sounds like you're
coming down with a little cold there.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.952
I-I-I'm just gonna light a match,
if you don't mind, here.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.713
Long John, look!

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.788
Flint hung 'em up there
after he gullied 'em...

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.871
to mark the trail
to the treasure.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.514
Wicked sense of humour
ol' Flinty had.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.239
- I-It's a sign. This is a cursed place.
- Yeah!

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.232
Well, there's
an informed opinion.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.839
All right,Jim, lad,
where to from here?

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.150
''On a heading
of 1 7 9 degrees...

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.596
walk 31 2 paces
from where the dead men hang high.''

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.715
That way!

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.109
- We're gonna go? We're gonna--
- Come on!

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.751
Howdy <i>vous,</i>
stinky froggy man and friends.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.868

of our queen...

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.433
Terrific. Captured by crazed wild pigs
and sacrificed hideously

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.308
- Are we lucky or what?
- Silence, smelly sailor mans!

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.311
You have violated
sacred island.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.073
Uh-uh, excuse me.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.596
Silence!

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.593
Bring forth
Boom Sha-Kal-a-Kal.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.033

- Because I like you, boy.

- Oh!

But Dead Tom's
always been dead.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.118

called Dead Tom.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.113

- Can we get on with this?

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.679
- Clueless!

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.115
- Give it to him!
- Yeah!

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.158
But, uh, it's not
even his birthday.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.515
- No, no, no, no! The paper!
- Oh.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.274
This is for you.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.554
- The Black Spot?
- Yeah.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.757
You dare to give me
the Black Spot?

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.638
- Uh, he-he told me to.
- Wh-- Shut up, will ya?

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.156
And it's drawn
on a page from the Bible.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.710
You tore a page
from the Holy Scriptures...

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.394
- to make a pirate's death sentence?
- Uh, here.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.508
Ohhh, the red hot
gates of hell...

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.318
are creeping open!

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.837
Satan is heating
his pokers for you...

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.990
you blasphemous heathens!

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.229
- Fall down on your knees...
- Oh!

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:21.313
and beg for deliverance
from damnation!

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.868
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive me!

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.200
Very good.
You're forgiven.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.874
- Oh, thank you.
- Now untie me!

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.996
Okay, okay. Untie him.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.629
- And let's go find the treasure!
- Yeah!

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.950
Oh, oh, you are a good man.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.679
You are a kind man.
A handsome man.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.513
- Precious.
- Oh, he's-- You're precious a-and--

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.908
- Beautiful.
- And he's beautiful. Oh.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.830
Yeah, here's the boat.
Oh, no!

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.356
Well, that won't help us.
We're gonna have to swim to the ship.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.635
Hello! Earth to Jimbo.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.397
Swimming to a ship that's full of
killer pirates to save the captain

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:13.631
- Look!
- Yes. The gunwale and keel

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.594
- Mr Arrow!
- Mr Arrow!

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.591
- Over here!
- Mr Arrow, over here!

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.399
Oh. Oh, boys.
Come join me...

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:25.711
aboard this exceptionally
safe little boat.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.711
Hmm.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.792
By the way, that Silver fellow
may not be trustworthy.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.633
- Ha-ha! Now he tells us!
- Yeah.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.917
And here's a photo opportunity
you will not want to miss.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.912
The actual jungle location for the movie
<i>Muppet Treasure Island</i>.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.831
- Oh, my goodness!
- Keep up, people.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.751
- Hey, when do we eat?
- Oh, my feet are killing me.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.798
Of all the backwater,
no-class piles of sand in the ocean...

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.553
you had to wash up on mine.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.598
Benjamina, I just want you
to know that I'm sorry.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.989
Sorry? No, no,
sorry doesn't cut it.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.514
You left me standing
at the altar!

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.473
I was on a ship headed
for Zanzibar. I got cold feet.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.438
You're a frog.
You're supposed to have cold feet.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.750
My mother came
all the way from France.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.593
I was wearing
her white lace dress.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.672
The cake was filled
with lemon custard!

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.274
Mina, fate has brought us
together again.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.192
Well, actually, buried treasure
and pirates brought us together--

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.271
Don't you start with me
about pirates!

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.033
After you jilted me, I took
up with this Bernie Flint.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.317
- The man was totally codependent.
- You and Captain Flint?

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.235
Well, he was a pirate, I was a lady.
You know the story.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.788
Smolly? He marooned me.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.472
Me!

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.197
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.431
Th-This is all my fault.
Oh, what have I done to you?

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.559
- Mushy-mushy!
- Kissy-kissy!

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.272
Bravo, Cap'n.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.398
Touchin' reunion, Benjamina.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.790
This seems to be your day
for renewing old...

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.194
acquaintances.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.754
Oh, well, hello, Long John.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.832
- Oh, no! Him too?
- Well, if you'd married me.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.672
Well, what does that
have to do with it?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.070
- I'm a pig! I need commitment!
- Commitment?

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.517
Now, I'm not gonna be really patient
about this, Benjamina.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.670
Where is the treasure?

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.359
Um, I just may not
tell you. Hmm.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.156
Oh, don't play games with me, lass.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.190
I tell you,
I'm not a patient man.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.390
Stop! Give up now...

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.835
weak and tiny pirate mans...

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.718
or die like stinking dogs.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.990
Hmm, we see you have
boom-boom sticks.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.033
Bye-bye.

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.396
Oh, brother!

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.710
- Now, Benjamina.
- What?

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.394
Where is the treasure?

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.234
There is no treasure.
I-It was all a clever ruse. H-Ha!

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.199
So where did you get that
gold necklace you're wearing?

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.033
The one made
of Spanish doubloons.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.599
Aye.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.910
Um...

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.274
Shopping Channel?

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.109
No!

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.952
Shh.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.031
- Shh.
- Shh.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.113
Oh, fiddle!

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.556
Make yourself useful.
Try and save us. Do something!

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.471
Shh!

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.710
Oh, Master Hawkins,
you've come to rescue us.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.711
I should've let him
live in my finger.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.878
We're ready,
Master Hawkins.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.076
- Do you think this
will work, Dr Livesey?

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.550
My research indicates
that pirates are very superstitious.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.715
Boogie, boogie, boogie!

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.349
I am the ghost
of Samuel Arrow.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.310
Boogie!

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.117
Come on.
We've got to save the captain!

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.430
You were so good, Mr Arrow.
That was beautiful.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.159
What do we do next?
What do we do now? Uh,Jim?

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.040
- Weigh anchor?
- Weigh anchor.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.192
- Set the sails.
- Set the sails!

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.478
- And you, Squire Trelawney.
- Uh, n-n-now, Master Hawkins, I-I-I--

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.233
You take the helm.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.189
Ah! Step aside, Mr Bimbo.
I shall be taking the helm.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.918
Hurry, Rizzo!

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.952
I'm going as fast as I can.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.078
Oh! Smolly, my love!

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.513
Oh, oh!

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.839
Smolly!

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.635
You can't hurt my frog!

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.029
Don't tell him anything, Mina.
I beg you!

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.237
He'll only kill you too.
Don't listen to him!

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.878
Now...

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.076
for the last time...

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.435
where's the blasted treasure?

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.956
- Yeah!
- Hah!

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.635
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
The treasure's at my place.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.553
North trail, split-level hut
with the pink lawn furniture.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.359
Now free him at once,
you scoundrel!

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.637
You know, I'm beginning to see
a pattern in the men I date.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.951
Yeah, well, uh, uh,
the past is behind us.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.838
And the future below us.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.998
Oh, it's okay, Mina.
We're together again.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.719
Yes, despite it all...

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.268
we have each other.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.118
- Oh, don't cry for me, Benjamina.
- Pardon?

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.069
<i>Was I dumb</i>
<i>or was I blind</i>

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.073
<i>Or did my heart</i>
<i>just lose its mind</i>

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.913
<i>Why'd I go and throw</i>

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.437
<i>Our perfect dream away</i>

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.670
<i>Looking back</i>
<i>I'll never know</i>

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.435
<i>How I ever let you go</i>

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.877
<i>But destiny could see</i>
<i>we deserved</i>

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.236
<i>To have another day</i>

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.911
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.029
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.272
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.114
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.756
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.196
<i>Now I know that life</i>

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.556
<i>Can take you by surprise</i>

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:35.349
<i>And sweep you off your feet</i>

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.438
<i>Did this happen to us</i>

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.514
<i>Or are wejust dreaming</i>

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.319
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.749
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.628
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:02.840
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.708
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.235
<i>So take my hand</i>

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.399
<i>And have no fear</i>

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.837
<i>We'll be all right</i>

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.276
<i>Love led us</i>

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.150
<i>Here</i>

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.996
Oh, Smolly.
You saved me.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.396
Come on, men!
It's back to Blighty now, lads!

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.516
The treasure's all ours!

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.915
Hurry. Come on.
Get in the boat.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.231
Long John! Long John!
Look! The ship!

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.878
Uh, yeah--
What are they doing?

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.076
There's no one on board.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.309
It's coming
straight for us!

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.709
I-It's the ghost
of Captain Flinty.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.950
He's coming to kill us.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.189
Come back, you cowards!

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.391
Hawkins.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.916
Look. It's the captain
and the pig.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.393
Oh, no!

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.478
Head for those cliffs.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.711
- Head for the cliffs, Squire.
- Aye, aye! Uh. Oh.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.870
Oh, Beakie, Beakie.
Look, look!

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.713
I think we're going to need a net.
Come along.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.075
Get back there,
you yellow-bellied bilge rats!

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.994
I'm not losing
that treasure now! Get out!

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.071
We're lowering the net now.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.959
All right, let's go. Okay.
That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:17.478
- We're coming, Captain Smollett!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.198
- Steady! Steady!
- Careful!

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.632
<i>Au revoir, mon capitaine</i>.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.155
- We got 'em!
- Oh, ho, ho! Yes!

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.268
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.076
Waldorf, you old fool!
We're heroes!

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.277
We saved the pig
and the frog!

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.113
Well, it was too late
to save the movie.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.559
Welcome aboard,
Captain Smollett.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.200
And welcome
to your lady pig friend.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.554
Ah! Look out! Ah!

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.276
The captain must have his sword.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.713
Whoa!

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.109
Wow! Ha!

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.839
Yah!

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.115
Captain!

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.555
Fight, you idiots!

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.397
Captain!

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.438
- Here!
- Ha! Ah!

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.399
- Wah!
- All right! No more Ms Nice Guy!

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.430
No one maroons me
and gets away with it!

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.157
- Good to see you alive, Mr Arrow.
- Huh! Thank you, Captain.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.800
Geronimo!

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.791
Oh, what am I gonna do? Oh!

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.838
- Come on!
- Come on, you! Hey!

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.276
- Oh, sorry.
- <i>En garde!</i>

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:06.273
- <i>Mi casa es su casa</i>.
- Ah, I make cheese

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.273
- Hi-yee, De Soto! Hi-ya!
- Oh, yah!

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.271
<i>!!Cucaracha!</i>

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.879
- Hah!
- Ahhh!

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.791
Come on,Jerry!
He's just a kid!

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.271
- Ohhh!
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.716
Okay, I give.
Uncle. Uh, I'm dead.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.596
Oh, oh, oh, Mr Bimbo, help!

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.795
- Am I dead?
- Huh?

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.954
- Wonderful!
- Uh--

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:59.717
- Mr Bimbo, that was
some amazing swordplay.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.871
Oh, watch out, Mr Arrow!

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.150
Well, thank you. But aren't you
supposed to be fighting against us?

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.629
Are you kiddin'?
I love you guys!

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.154
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.556
Cowabunga!

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.236
Come on. Fight.
Where are you?

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.356
- Ohhh!
- Hmm.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.355
And as for you!

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.350
- Oh!
- Silver!

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.710
Hmm-hmm. Hah!

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.917
Hah! Hah!

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.352
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, huh?

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.993
- Ah. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Wow!

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.640
Yes! Yes! Smolly! Yes!

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.555
- Hah!
- Yes!

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.471
Ha-ha, Silver!

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.114
Ha-ha, ho-ho!
Not bad for an amphibian.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:23.432
Smolly, Smolly, he's our man!
If he can't do it, no one can! Yea!

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.115
- Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha!
- Excuse me.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.672
Ohhh!

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.435
Uh-- Uh-- Uh--

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.440
I'm a frog.
You know, slippery hands.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.718
Uh, you know, I never really believed
that violence solved anything anyway.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.917
Really? Allow me
to disagree, Cap'n.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.109
Kill Captain Smollett,
and you'll have to kill me.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.191
Kill Jim,
and you'll have to kill me.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.077
Kill Gonzo,
and you'll have to kill me.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.230
Kill Squire Trelawney
and Mr Bimbo...

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.710
and you'll have to
negotiate strenuously.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.552
Going somewhere,
John-John?

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:18.113
Well, Mr Hawkins,
it seems your little family...

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.555
has come together
against me.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.231
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.029
Well, you know, I, for one,
feel better about myself.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.874
Yeah. A-And I believe
that I have learned a valuable lesson.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.997
- Why, you!
- Shut up!

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.035
Okay, stop biting me.
Okay, I said something wrong!

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.193
Silver!

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.193
I suppose you'll be blowing
the whistle on me now, won't you,Jim?

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.716
I suppose I will. You have to return
to Bristol to stand trial.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.156
Oh, I'm sorry,Jim.
I got a terrible fear of hanging.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.191
We're shipmates, aren't we,Jim?

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.351
Gentlemen of fortune, together.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.033
Give us one more chance?

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.874
Oh, hell,Jim.
I could never harm you.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.035
You're honest
and brave and true.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.153
- You didn't learn that from me.
- I learnt it from my friends,

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.119
Now take your oars and row away.
I never want to see you again, ever.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.711
Oh,Jim!

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.950
'Tis a shame, really.
We'd have made

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.910
Well done,Jim.
Your father would be proud.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.998
Captain Smollett,
I have most distressing news.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.437
One of the jolly boats is missing,
and I know for a fact

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.670
Ahhh!

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.433
This is not fun.

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.112
Flaubert, meet Da-Da.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.873
- Ready to sail, sir.
- Hmm.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.520
Where to,
Captain Hawkins?

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.511
To wherever the wind
may take us.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.239
Off to Zanzibar,
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.312
Oh, brother.
Here they go again.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.231
<i>Love power</i>

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.878
<i>Love power</i>

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.520
<i>Love power</i>

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.558
<i>A little love power</i>

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.313
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.789
<i>And softer than</i>
<i>the summer rain</i>

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.473
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>What kind of power</i>

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.391
<i>A little love power</i>

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.075
<i>It can lift you up</i>
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.118
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.111
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:07.033
<i>There ain't no sun</i>
<i>in the morning sky</i>

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.271
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.477
<i>Breeze ain't blowing</i>
<i>and the bird don't fly</i>

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.757
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:19.877
<i>Then someone kind</i>
<i>reaches out a hand</i>

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.997
<i>And smiles</i>
<i>a warm sweet smile</i>

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.277
<i>And then your heart</i>
<i>come to understand</i>

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.432
<i>What make the world spin</i>
<i>Where do magic begin</i>

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.033
<i>Someone to believe in</i>

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.839
<i>Feel so good</i>
<i>when everybody feels</i>

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.673
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>There's no higher power</i>

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.399
- <i>A little love power</i>
- <i>Nothing in the world</i>

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.153
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.357
<i>And softer</i>
<i>than the summer rain</i>

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.874
<i>Oh, love power</i>

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:51.077
- <i>Everybody, feel it</i>
- <i>A little love power</i>

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.388
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.948
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.793
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.757
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.196
<i>So many people</i>
<i>they feel so bad</i>

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.635
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:09.599
<i>Yeah, they make the money</i>
<i>but they still so sad</i>

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.478
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.757
<i>Nobody told them</i>
<i>that it ain't that stuff</i>

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.071
<i>That makes life worthwhile</i>

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.118
<i>'Cause even if</i>
<i>you've got enough</i>

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:25.317
<i>You got less than nothing</i>
<i>till you know for certain</i>

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.277
<i>Enough to put your faith in</i>

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.794
<i>It feels so good</i>
<i>when everybody feels</i>

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.678
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>People, can you feel it</i>

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.149
<i>A little love power</i>

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.118
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.430
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.876
<i>Let me tell you now</i>

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.236
- <i>Whoa-oh</i>
- <i>Feel the inspiration</i>

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.880
- <i>Hey</i>
- <i>Don't it feel like heaven</i>

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.520
<i>It make the soul</i>
<i>and the spirit strong</i>

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.558
<i>When everybody come</i>
<i>and every single one</i>

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:57.949
<i>They hear the song now</i>

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.077
<i>Oh, love power</i>

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.720
<i>A little love power</i>

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.792
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.394
<i>And softer</i>
<i>than the summer rain</i>

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.836
- <i>Can you feel it, oh</i>
- <i>Love power</i>

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.639
- <i>What kind of power</i>
- <i>A little love power</i>

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.948
<i>It can lift you up</i>

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.713
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.473
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.030
<i>- One love</i>
<i>- Lift you up when you get low</i>

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.031
<i>-And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:31.715
May I call you Johnny?
Stop me if you heard this one.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.395
Why does the ocean roar?

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.311
Give up?

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.915
You would, too, if you had
crabs on your bottom...

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.468
and oysters in your bed.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.075
Get it? Oysters? Bed?

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.310
Ooh, I love that one.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:53.075
I'm tellin' ya, I got
a million more just like that.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.111
<i>Was I dumb</i>

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.839
<i>Or was I blind</i>

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:16.833
<i>Or did my heart</i>
<i>just lose its mind</i>

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.434
<i>Why'd I go and throw</i>

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:24.514
<i>Our perfect dream away</i>

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.398
<i>Oh, looking back</i>

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.438
<i>I'll never know</i>

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.274
<i>How I ever let you go</i>

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:38.592
<i>But destiny could see</i>
<i>we deserve</i>

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.355
<i>To have another day</i>

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.268
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.909
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.039
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.795
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.160
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.713
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.031
<i>Ooh</i>

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.951
<i>I confess</i>

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.871
<i>It's sad but true</i>

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:20.511
- <i>Sad but true</i>
- <i>I lost myself when I lost you</i>

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.717
<i>But I held your memory</i>

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:29.033
<i>Through each lonely night</i>

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.395
<i>Oh, let's forget</i>

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:34.278
- <i>What's gone before</i>
- <i>What's gone</i>

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:38.194
- <i>Now we both</i>
<i>know so much more</i>

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.353
<i>And we've been given</i>
<i>another chance</i>

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.637
<i>To make it work out right</i>

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.711
<i>Make it work</i>

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.870
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.555
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.872
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.839
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.953
<i>Love led us here</i>

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.398
<i>Now I know that life</i>
<i>can take you by surprise</i>

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.031
<i>And sweep you off your feet</i>

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.237
<i>Did this happen to us</i>

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.790
<i>Or are we just dreamin'</i>

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.510
<i>Dreamin'</i>

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:41.679
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.719
