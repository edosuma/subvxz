WEBVTT

00:06.252 --> 00:07.461
Is that our P2P protocol?

00:07.753 --> 00:09.544
-Yeah, I'm just hacking for fun.
-Videochat?

00:09.544 --> 00:13.252
-Boom.
-Yes! I can... see you now.

00:13.252 --> 00:15.544
It's me. Pakistani Denzel.

00:17.503 --> 00:19.753
From the ashes
will rise the phoenix

00:19.753 --> 00:22.503
that shall be known as
"Bachmanity."

00:22.795 --> 00:24.503
That's what you're gonna
call your company?

00:24.753 --> 00:28.294
Coleman Blair partners
would like to offer Pied Piper

00:28.294 --> 00:30.002
six million dollars.

00:30.002 --> 00:32.252
We'll just need
your John Hancock.

00:32.252 --> 00:34.002
-I can't.
-Why the fuck not?!

00:34.002 --> 00:35.086
Because the numbers are fake!

00:35.586 --> 00:38.753
We bought fake users
from a Bangladeshi click farm.

00:39.419 --> 00:40.586
Laurie wants out.

00:40.836 --> 00:43.586
Even a whiff of fraud
is a mortal sin for VCs.

00:43.586 --> 00:44.795
- Ow.

00:45.169 --> 00:47.669
Pied Piper and all of its assets
are now officially

00:47.669 --> 00:49.503
the property of Bachmanity LLC.

00:49.503 --> 00:52.419
-Did you just say "Bachmanity?"
-They had the highest bid?

00:52.419 --> 00:54.252
--Bachmanity it is then.

00:55.586 --> 00:57.294
Richard, you pulled us
out of a nosedive.

00:57.461 --> 01:01.252
Of course, inevitably we will
plummet towards the earth,

01:01.252 --> 01:03.628
but in the meantime
we are flying high.

01:15.461 --> 01:18.169
No, I'll get
my car tomorrow.
I had too many.

01:18.169 --> 01:19.920
Got an Uber coming.
Thank you.

01:23.044 --> 01:24.252
That was fast.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.628
Hello. For Jim?

01:26.628 --> 01:27.669
Yep.

01:29.169 --> 01:32.544
Oh, would you--
would you care
for a water?

01:33.795 --> 01:35.336
Why are
your fingers orange?

01:35.336 --> 01:37.002
It's-- It's iodine.

01:37.002 --> 01:38.461
I've been...
biting my nails,

01:38.461 --> 01:40.169
so I put this on there
to stop me from doing it.

01:40.169 --> 01:42.336
Looks like Cheetos,
tastes like asshole.

01:43.961 --> 01:46.127
So, what do you do?

01:46.127 --> 01:49.002
Venture capital
over at Wood Opal.

01:49.002 --> 01:50.544
Wow.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.127
Wow. Good.

01:52.127 --> 01:54.336
Mm-hmm.

01:54.336 --> 01:56.503
Uh, can I take this?

01:56.503 --> 01:58.002
Sure.
All right.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.544
Hello, hi!

02:00.544 --> 02:02.211
My goodness,
this video chat app

02:02.211 --> 02:05.336
is light-years ahead
of anything else out there
on the market.

02:05.336 --> 02:06.378
I agree.

02:06.378 --> 02:09.669
Yes, and you can add
multiple concurrent users

02:09.669 --> 02:13.378
with no loss
in picture quality,
even on conventional 3G.

02:13.378 --> 02:15.711
Let's see what happens
when we add more friends.

02:16.711 --> 02:18.669
Hi, friend.
What's up?

02:18.669 --> 02:20.378
Hello, friend.

02:20.378 --> 02:23.002
Hey, should we add
another friend?

02:23.002 --> 02:24.252
Yeah, we should.

02:24.252 --> 02:27.127
How many friends can we
conference at the same time?

02:27.127 --> 02:30.378
Well, thanks to the amazing
new TURN server,

02:30.378 --> 02:31.669
as many as you like.

02:31.669 --> 02:35.044
What if someone is in an area
with poor cellular reception?

02:35.044 --> 02:36.544
I doubt it would even work.

02:36.544 --> 02:39.086
And if it did, the lag,
the video quality...

02:39.086 --> 02:40.211
...that would
be horrible.

02:40.211 --> 02:41.795
Well, let's find out.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.378
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

02:43.378 --> 02:44.961
Yeah, got it.
I'm on it.

02:44.961 --> 02:46.127
Hey, friends.

02:46.127 --> 02:48.753
Wow! Look at that.
The image is so clear.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.628
We all look amazing,
don't we?

02:50.628 --> 02:52.169
Yeah, we really do.
Yes.

02:52.169 --> 02:54.378
Is that really just on
a cell signal?

02:54.378 --> 02:55.378
Uh, yes.

02:55.378 --> 02:57.711
This is the amazing
new company PiperChat.

02:59.419 --> 03:00.920
Wait a minute.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.044
I saw you at TechCrunch.
You're Richard Hendricks.

03:04.044 --> 03:06.378
The very same. Yeah.
You're the fucking guy

03:06.378 --> 03:08.252
that tried to walk
into Coleman Blair

03:08.252 --> 03:09.252
with fraudulent numbers.

03:09.252 --> 03:10.419
- No!
Uh-oh.

03:10.419 --> 03:12.211
- That was my fault.
- Yes, but no.

03:12.211 --> 03:14.711
I mean, that--
that's the old thing.
This is the new thing,

03:14.711 --> 03:16.252
and I can assure you,
it's very, very real.

03:16.252 --> 03:19.086
You're not even my driver.
This says Sandeep
in an Escalade.

03:19.086 --> 03:21.378
Ah, shit.
Look, look.

03:21.378 --> 03:23.586
No one will even talk to us,
which is crazy.

03:23.586 --> 03:26.252
We just surpassed 120,000
daily active users

03:26.252 --> 03:30.169
and we're growing at a rate
of 18 percent, organically,
week over week.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.086
Richard, that's
Facebook-level growth.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.419
- Pull over now.
- That is great!

03:33.419 --> 03:34.961
Richard, Richard,
do not pull over.

03:34.961 --> 03:37.336
You will never see him again
if he gets out.
I am not involved!

03:37.336 --> 03:38.628
Richard,
can you hear me?

03:38.628 --> 03:40.211
Okay, for real, Richard.
You have to pull over.

03:40.211 --> 03:42.628
Richard, do not--
do not pull over.
You'll never see him again.

03:42.628 --> 03:44.503
Hey, are you
on the shitter?
Pull the fuck over.

03:45.628 --> 03:47.044
- Richard!
- Okay.

03:47.044 --> 03:49.461
What the fuck? Are you seriously
trying to kidnap me right now?

03:49.461 --> 03:51.795
No. It's the locks.
I-- I don't know.
It's not my car.

03:51.795 --> 03:53.211
Child locks are on.

03:53.211 --> 03:55.252
I was babysitting my friend
Gloria's great-granddaughter.

03:55.252 --> 03:56.544
It's on the left.

03:56.544 --> 03:59.294
Got it. Look, look, look.
God damn it!

03:59.294 --> 04:01.002
Come on. Listen to me.

04:01.002 --> 04:03.211
We are desperate.
We need funding.

04:03.211 --> 04:04.419
You need funding?
Yes.

04:05.503 --> 04:07.294
Hit a million
daily active users

04:07.294 --> 04:09.336
while sustaining
the same kind of growth,

04:09.336 --> 04:12.586
then everybody in town
will be trying to kidnap you.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.878
Problem solved.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.294
Yeah,
easy for you to say.

04:15.294 --> 04:17.503
Can you imagine how much
these servers are costing me

04:17.503 --> 04:19.168
just to keep
this ship afloat?

04:19.168 --> 04:22.252
Right, and every new user
increases our server cost.

04:22.252 --> 04:24.503
Really? I'm sorry.

04:24.503 --> 04:27.002
Is it hard
to become a billionaire?

04:27.002 --> 04:29.669
Welcome to the Valley,
assholes.

04:30.669 --> 04:32.169
Fuck.

04:32.169 --> 04:35.211
What a dick.
Well, assuming
we don't get arrested,

04:35.211 --> 04:36.795
looks like we have
to work our asses off

04:36.795 --> 04:38.628
to reduce
our hosting bill.

04:40.336 --> 04:41.544
Hi.
Hi.

04:41.544 --> 04:44.002
If you actually get
to a million users...

04:44.920 --> 04:47.002
call me.
My cell's on the back.

04:47.002 --> 04:48.044
Oh, okay.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.252
Did you finish?

05:00.252 --> 05:01.753
Yeah, I just pushed my code.

05:01.753 --> 05:03.086
Took me
two fucking days,

05:03.086 --> 05:05.836
but I broke up
our entire code base
into parallel services.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.586
You know, this whole job
would've been a lot easier

05:07.586 --> 05:10.127
if you hadn't
designed sloppy services
in the first place.

05:10.127 --> 05:11.086
Oh, silly me.

05:11.086 --> 05:12.669
I guess when
I hacked together

05:12.669 --> 05:14.336
the video chat
as an in-house tool,

05:14.336 --> 05:17.002
I didn't foresee
that hundreds of thousands
of people

05:17.002 --> 05:20.086
would shit themselves over
how fucking awesome it was.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.461
I'll never underestimate
my talents again.

05:22.461 --> 05:25.378
Don't worry.
I'll continue
to do it for you.

05:25.378 --> 05:27.169
Less talk,
more work, boys.

05:27.169 --> 05:29.378
I'm not paying you
to coffee klatsch

05:29.378 --> 05:31.044
like a bunch
of fucking yentas.

05:31.044 --> 05:32.294
You're not paying us at all.

05:32.294 --> 05:34.628
I'm not paying you
because you're not
the one

05:34.628 --> 05:37.211
getting fucked face-first
by your credit card company

05:37.211 --> 05:39.419
because of massive
AWS hosting fees.

05:39.419 --> 05:42.002
Well, you should
bear 100 percent
of the company's cost,

05:42.002 --> 05:44.920
seeing as you do own
100 percent of the company.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.252
What's taking you so long
to give us our fucking shares?

05:47.252 --> 05:49.711
Recapping
a company is complex.

05:49.711 --> 05:52.711
But I assure you,
Big Head and I are
on the case.

05:52.711 --> 05:54.961
You better be.
We're not gonna
work for free forever.

05:56.753 --> 05:59.086
Hey, the Karachi Kid
and I finished.

05:59.086 --> 06:00.294
Did you push your code?

06:01.378 --> 06:02.628
Uh...

06:02.628 --> 06:03.795
actually, no.

06:03.795 --> 06:06.086
Well, Your Highness,
could you please push
your code?

06:06.086 --> 06:07.586
Well, I couldn't
push that code,

06:07.586 --> 06:10.169
because I didn't
write that code.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.753
What? We stayed up
for two fucking days.

06:12.753 --> 06:14.086
Why didn't you write
your code?

06:14.086 --> 06:17.211
Well, because I was working
on something much better.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.461
So, I started to optimize
our code to handle higher tr...

06:24.628 --> 06:26.753
You're supposed
to follow me.

06:26.753 --> 06:27.961
Oh.

06:27.961 --> 06:30.628
I, uh, I started
to optimize our code

06:30.628 --> 06:31.878
to handle
higher traffic.

06:31.878 --> 06:34.461
Then it occurred to me,
why rewrite our old code

06:34.461 --> 06:36.961
when I can build
a new encoder

06:36.961 --> 06:40.294
that doesn't strip away
a ton of channels and metadata.

06:41.419 --> 06:44.628
So, I extended
my compression algorithm

06:44.628 --> 06:48.086
to support-- get this--
12-bit color.

06:50.461 --> 06:53.628
Okay, so our users will be
able to experience

06:53.628 --> 06:56.127
a 10 percent increase
in image quality

06:56.127 --> 06:59.795
with absolutely no increase
in server load whatsoever.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.044
Just-Just-Just--
Just watch this.

07:02.044 --> 07:03.836
Before.

07:03.836 --> 07:04.878
After.

07:04.878 --> 07:06.294
Before.

07:06.294 --> 07:07.669
After.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.419
Richard, I'm trying
very hard

07:10.419 --> 07:12.878
not to completely
lose my shit right now.

07:12.878 --> 07:14.002
I get it. I get it.

07:14.002 --> 07:16.836
After every VC in town
turned us down,

07:16.836 --> 07:20.044
we decided
that the best way
to stay alive

07:20.044 --> 07:24.836
until we got to a million users
was to cut server usage.

07:24.836 --> 07:25.961
Remember that?

07:25.961 --> 07:27.878
The whole reason
that Gilfoyle and I

07:27.878 --> 07:30.336
stayed up for 48
fucking straight hours

07:30.336 --> 07:33.669
was to decrease
server load,

07:33.669 --> 07:35.669
not keep it the same.

07:35.669 --> 07:37.795
Technically, the reason
why we stayed up for two days

07:37.795 --> 07:40.461
was to maximize our ability
to get a million users,

07:40.461 --> 07:42.044
and I just did that.

07:42.044 --> 07:45.586
Because who doesn't want
10 percent better image quality?

07:45.586 --> 07:47.669
Who doesn't want it?
Everyone.

07:47.669 --> 07:49.044
Everyone doesn't want it!

07:49.044 --> 07:50.920
We already have
the best video chat.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.503
People are using this
on their cellphones.

07:52.503 --> 07:54.753
They're not gonna be able
to tell the fucking difference.

07:54.753 --> 07:56.544
Guys, this is
a better product,

07:56.544 --> 07:59.544
and I'm the CEO, and I'm gonna
say this is where we go.

07:59.544 --> 08:01.628
You fucking prick.
Whoa.

08:01.628 --> 08:04.336
Guys...
please be civil.

08:04.336 --> 08:06.711
You hate the video chat.
I don't hate
the video chat, Dinesh.

08:06.711 --> 08:09.211
You've always
hated the video chat,
because it's my thing,

08:09.211 --> 08:11.169
and you wanna rewrite it
to make it all about you.

08:11.169 --> 08:12.878
You're fucking jealous.

08:12.878 --> 08:14.503
Jealous? Jealous?

08:14.503 --> 08:16.711
You built the video chat,
I'll give you that. Okay.

08:16.711 --> 08:19.544
You did, but you did it
using my algorithm.

08:19.544 --> 08:21.795
Right, like when Picasso
painted a masterpiece,

08:21.795 --> 08:23.461
the guy who made
the brushes and the paint

08:23.461 --> 08:24.836
deserved all the credit, right?

08:24.836 --> 08:26.002
So you're Picasso now?

08:26.002 --> 08:28.086
I think I need to... leave,

08:28.086 --> 08:29.378
but I love you guys.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.586
Dinesh, I'm sorry,

08:30.586 --> 08:32.919
but I think we should be
doing a little bit more

08:32.919 --> 08:34.919
with this revolutionary
compression algorithm

08:34.919 --> 08:36.211
than passable video chat.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.586
But we already
did more, Richard.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.419
It was called
"the platform."

08:40.419 --> 08:42.251
And it was exactly
what you wanted to make,

08:42.251 --> 08:44.086
and it fucking failed, okay?

08:44.086 --> 08:46.252
I'm sorry,
but it's bad enough

08:46.252 --> 08:48.294
that we can't get any funding
because of you.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.002
You're killing us out there.

08:50.002 --> 08:52.753
Don't also sabotage us
in here, too.

08:52.753 --> 08:54.795
Pied Piper is
a video chat company.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.711
Get your head around that.

08:59.294 --> 09:01.795
I'm quite certain
I've never said this before.

09:03.044 --> 09:04.753
I agree with Dinesh.

09:10.961 --> 09:11.961
Well.

09:17.252 --> 09:21.628
Oh. Well, that was just
a whole heap of fun.

09:21.628 --> 09:25.252
Ordinarily, I loathe
coming to China, but when
you close a deal like that,

09:25.252 --> 09:28.169
it makes the whole trip
a delight.

09:28.169 --> 09:29.795
Champagne, gentlemen?

09:29.795 --> 09:31.753
I think that's
very much in order.

09:33.086 --> 09:35.127
I know you don't
toot your own horn,

09:35.127 --> 09:36.711
so I'll do it for you.

09:36.711 --> 09:37.961
Here to you, Jack,

09:37.961 --> 09:40.002
and to your
Hooli/Endframe box

09:40.002 --> 09:43.294
becoming the most successful
American data storage appliance

09:43.294 --> 09:45.920
to ever be manufactured
in China.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.961
Toot, toot.

09:47.961 --> 09:52.211
Watch your back, Jeff Bezos,
here comes Hooli.

09:52.211 --> 09:55.169
All right, gentlemen...
our flight today

09:55.169 --> 09:57.419
from Shanghai
to Moffett Field
in Mountain View

09:57.419 --> 09:59.961
will be just over 11 hours,
so if you'll just--

09:59.961 --> 10:03.961
Oh, actually, I was
headed up to Jackson Hole,
see the wife and kids.

10:03.961 --> 10:05.878
I-- I was gonna
charter up tomorrow,

10:05.878 --> 10:08.503
but maybe you could
ask the boys

10:08.503 --> 10:10.503
just to drop me off
on the way?

10:10.503 --> 10:11.961
Save me the trouble?

10:11.961 --> 10:14.044
Of course.

10:14.044 --> 10:16.669
Well, and I mean,
it's really not a big deal,

10:16.669 --> 10:20.002
but since we are headed east,
I think Jackson is further.

10:20.002 --> 10:21.503
Maybe we'll head
to Moffett first,

10:21.503 --> 10:23.711
then have the guys hop you
onto Jackson, okay?

10:23.711 --> 10:26.378
Well-- Well, actually,
on flights like this,

10:26.378 --> 10:28.252
the boys like
to go over the Pole,

10:28.252 --> 10:31.044
so that, technically,
is a little more north
to south,

10:31.044 --> 10:33.211
and Jackson
is quite a bit
further north.

10:33.211 --> 10:35.211
So I think, maybe,
just go to Jackson first,

10:35.211 --> 10:37.294
then head on off to Moffett.
That sound good?

10:37.294 --> 10:39.378
Of course.
Great.

10:39.378 --> 10:41.252
I'm gonna get a pillow.

10:47.378 --> 10:51.044
You know what
we desperately
need is a palapa.

10:51.044 --> 10:52.544
A ploppa?

10:52.544 --> 10:54.252
A palapa.

10:54.252 --> 10:57.127
It's a Mexican structure
with palm fronds.

10:57.127 --> 10:58.544
It's essentially a gazebo,

10:58.544 --> 11:03.211
but spicier and with a south-
of-the-border kind of vibe.

11:03.211 --> 11:06.044
I think it would make us
feel less exposed.

11:06.044 --> 11:08.544
And generally,
I think it would
be good for morale.

11:08.544 --> 11:11.586
Speaking of which,
morale has not exactly
been skyrocketing.

11:11.586 --> 11:15.294
So, we need to get this
cap table done tout de suite.

11:15.294 --> 11:16.920
Richard and the fellows

11:16.920 --> 11:19.419
are entitled to 40 percent
of the company.

11:19.419 --> 11:20.669
Now, if we each
give 20 percent,

11:20.669 --> 11:23.878
we would still own
30 percent each.

11:23.878 --> 11:25.378
That seems fair.

11:25.378 --> 11:26.920
Seems totally fair to me.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.127
Dad?

11:28.127 --> 11:30.461
Nope. Not gonna happen.

11:30.461 --> 11:33.127
Mr. Bighetti,
with all due respect, I--

11:33.127 --> 11:34.544
If you had any respect,

11:34.544 --> 11:37.419
you wouldn't have talked my son
into wasting his money...

11:37.419 --> 11:38.378
again.

11:38.378 --> 11:40.252
My son's not
giving up one share.

11:40.252 --> 11:42.086
Not now, not ever.

11:42.086 --> 11:45.711
Mr. Bighetti, if you're
going to control your son's
board seat,

11:45.711 --> 11:47.378
these decisions
have to be unanimous.

11:47.378 --> 11:48.920
You're going
to kill this comp--

11:48.920 --> 11:50.336
I don't care.

11:50.336 --> 11:52.795
In my eyes,
the company is
already dead.

11:52.795 --> 11:53.961
Killed by you.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.378
That's my edge.

11:56.378 --> 11:58.086
If all I accomplish
by doing this

11:58.086 --> 12:01.086
is making you as miserable
as you've made me

12:01.086 --> 12:03.336
watching you fleece my son,

12:03.336 --> 12:04.795
then I'm okay with that.

12:04.795 --> 12:06.795
He seems okay
with that.

12:06.795 --> 12:09.169
So you expect me
to give the 40 percent

12:09.169 --> 12:12.252
to the gents
from my 50 percent,

12:12.252 --> 12:14.586
effectively leaving me
with 10 percent?

12:14.586 --> 12:15.878
Yes.

12:15.878 --> 12:17.378
No. No, no, no.

12:17.378 --> 12:21.753
Then I would've
invested 500 thou--
a half of a million dollars

12:21.753 --> 12:23.878
just to end up
where I started?

12:23.878 --> 12:25.086
Unacceptable.

12:25.086 --> 12:26.836
I can accept that.

12:26.836 --> 12:28.378
I'm going to bed.

12:28.378 --> 12:30.169
Good night,
Brown Bear.

12:30.169 --> 12:31.461
Love you, Papa Bear.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.878
Goddamn motherfucker.

12:51.878 --> 12:55.252
- I mean, the guys are right.
- I'm fucking up the company.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.169
I'm not helping
in any way.

12:57.169 --> 13:00.419
You're certainly not helping
your cuticles by biting on them.

13:00.419 --> 13:03.252
Your nail beds
are gonna get infected.

13:03.252 --> 13:05.086
Where'd you learn how
to do this, anyway?

13:05.086 --> 13:08.336
When I was on the street,
it was a means of survival.

13:09.836 --> 13:12.336
I don't know, it's just that...

13:12.336 --> 13:14.169
I mean, I almost killed us,

13:14.169 --> 13:16.127
the company,
and that is so selfish.

13:16.127 --> 13:18.419
I mean, if we have to get
a million users,

13:18.419 --> 13:21.086
I need to get us funding,
right now.

13:21.086 --> 13:22.878
How? We've already
been turned down

13:22.878 --> 13:24.878
by every
respectable VC in town.

13:27.378 --> 13:30.211
Who said anything
about... respectable?

13:32.419 --> 13:33.920
Oh, Richard, no.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.211
Fuck yes,
I want to talk business.
What's the play?

13:36.211 --> 13:37.795
Let's fuck this thing
right in the pussy.

13:37.795 --> 13:40.378
Thanks for meeting me here.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.211
My fucking nanny
got another DUI

13:42.211 --> 13:44.044
and lost her license,
and I'm stuck picking up

13:44.044 --> 13:46.127
my own kid
like an asshole.
So what's up?

13:46.127 --> 13:47.711
Uhh...

13:47.711 --> 13:51.378
Well, I know
you wanted to buy
Erlich's Pied Piper shares

13:51.378 --> 13:53.294
back in the previous iteration,
the platform.

13:53.294 --> 13:56.002
Well, I was hoping
you would want to come on
as a follow-on investor

13:56.002 --> 13:58.252
for the current platform.
The video chat?

13:58.252 --> 14:01.252
Yeah. It's got a great tech.
We're growing like crazy.

14:01.252 --> 14:03.753
In fact,
that's why we need funding,
to keep up with the users,

14:03.753 --> 14:06.961
and I think it could be
really good if we could
just keep it going.

14:06.961 --> 14:08.753
No, you don't.

14:08.753 --> 14:10.294
What?

14:10.294 --> 14:11.669
You don't like it.

14:11.669 --> 14:13.336
You don't believe
in this product
you're selling.

14:13.336 --> 14:18.252
Russ, no, that's--
It's a good, sound business.

14:18.252 --> 14:19.961
As I said,
the tech is great

14:19.961 --> 14:21.753
and all the guys
are really behind it.

14:21.753 --> 14:23.127
But you're not
behind it, Richard.

14:23.127 --> 14:26.878
I can tell, and as much
as you want to be, you're not.

14:26.878 --> 14:28.586
It's like this.

14:28.586 --> 14:30.336
You're trying
to date a woman,

14:30.336 --> 14:32.920
but deep down in your heart
you know you're gay.
Uhh...

14:32.920 --> 14:36.461
Deep in your soul,
you know you would
rather be plowing a dude!

14:36.461 --> 14:39.795
I don't-- I do--
Okay, what dude?

14:39.795 --> 14:42.878
It could be any dude,
as long as you really
want to fuck him.

14:42.878 --> 14:44.961
It could be a--
a twink, a bear,

14:44.961 --> 14:47.127
an otter, a circuit queen,
a chub, a pup, a gipster,

14:47.127 --> 14:49.669
a daddy chaser, a leather man,
a ladyboy, a Donald Duck.

14:49.669 --> 14:52.711
Donald Duck's a gay guy who's
been kicked out of the Navy.

14:52.711 --> 14:54.294
H-How do you know
so many gay things?

14:54.294 --> 14:57.127
My grandfather just
came out of the closet.
Beautiful. Very inspiring.

14:57.127 --> 15:00.044
But the point is,
if you're gonna spend
all day fucking,

15:00.044 --> 15:03.503
shouldn't Pied Piper be
a dude you wanna fuck?

15:04.795 --> 15:06.211
All right.
Let's do an exercise.

15:06.211 --> 15:07.961
You've got unlimited time
and resources,

15:07.961 --> 15:10.294
you can build anything
in the world you want
with your compression,

15:10.294 --> 15:11.628
anything at all,
what's it gonna be?

15:11.628 --> 15:14.211
- Three, two, one, go.
- Go, go, go.

15:14.211 --> 15:16.669
You said I have
unlimited time?
Now. Now, now!

15:16.669 --> 15:18.252
A new Internet.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.294
What? Why?

15:20.294 --> 15:23.544
Okay. Well, I haven't really
thought this through, so...

15:25.336 --> 15:27.169
Okay.

15:27.169 --> 15:29.044
I own a telescope...
Of course you do.

15:29.044 --> 15:33.127
...and I brought it out
one night to look
at the full moon.

15:33.127 --> 15:35.836
Of course you did.
And I got to thinking...

15:36.753 --> 15:39.169
"Wow, we put
a man on the moon

15:39.169 --> 15:42.378
using the computing power
of a handheld calculator."

15:43.378 --> 15:45.711
And then I thought,
"Okay...

15:45.711 --> 15:48.961
"there's literally millions
of times

15:48.961 --> 15:50.836
"more computing power
in my phone

15:50.836 --> 15:53.920
and that's just
sitting in my pocket
doing nothing." Right?

15:53.920 --> 15:57.461
So then I thought, there's,
what, billions of phones

15:57.461 --> 16:00.336
all around the world
with the same computing power

16:00.336 --> 16:02.169
just sitting
in people's pockets.

16:02.169 --> 16:06.711
So then I thought,
"What if we use
all those phones

16:06.711 --> 16:08.544
to build
a massive network?"

16:08.544 --> 16:11.419
We use
my compression algorithm

16:11.419 --> 16:14.419
to make everything
small and efficient to move
things around, and...

16:15.461 --> 16:16.920
if we could do it...

16:16.920 --> 16:20.711
we could build a completely
decentralized version

16:20.711 --> 16:23.378
of our current Internet,
with no firewalls,

16:23.378 --> 16:26.711
no tolls,
no government regulation,

16:26.711 --> 16:30.002
no spying.
Information...

16:30.002 --> 16:32.378
would be totally free
in every sense of the word.

16:33.336 --> 16:35.211
You wanna build
a new Internet?

16:35.211 --> 16:38.795
Yeah, it's--
Richard, I like it.

16:38.795 --> 16:40.211
That I would fund.

16:40.211 --> 16:42.586
Well, I-I-- I don't know
if it's possible, and--

16:42.586 --> 16:45.211
Look, if this new Internet
is the man of your dreams

16:45.211 --> 16:47.044
and this is the man
that you wanna fuck,

16:47.044 --> 16:48.378
then you need
to fuck him.

16:48.378 --> 16:50.378
That man
I will pay you
to fuck.

16:50.378 --> 16:51.544
Where the fuck
is that kid?

16:52.628 --> 16:53.628
Wait a minute.

16:54.753 --> 16:55.753
Aw, shit.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.419
They kicked us
out of this place.

16:57.419 --> 17:00.211
I'm at the wrong
fucking school.

17:00.211 --> 17:04.461
Richard, you find that man,
fuck him good.

17:04.461 --> 17:06.544
Careful please.
He's gonna peel out.

17:06.544 --> 17:09.544
♪ Cut my life into pieces,
this is my last resort ♪

17:14.586 --> 17:16.586
Monica, I need to--

17:16.586 --> 17:18.544
Oh. You're not...

17:18.544 --> 17:22.169
Monica? No. Thank God.
I'm Ed Chen.

17:22.169 --> 17:25.211
Laurie put me in the good office
and moved Monica down the hall.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.836
Way down the hall.

17:29.503 --> 17:31.378
Okay. Sorry.

17:31.378 --> 17:33.795
You're gonna listen
to Russ Hanneman?

17:33.795 --> 17:36.211
Richard, you sound
like a crazy person.

17:36.211 --> 17:37.961
I know, but--
but Russ is right.

17:37.961 --> 17:40.628
I mean, I hate the video chat.
I really do.

17:40.628 --> 17:42.127
Oh...
What?

17:43.753 --> 17:45.461
Oh, wow, you can see
right into the--

17:45.461 --> 17:47.127
Yeah, I'm very aware.

17:47.127 --> 17:50.127
Laurie is punishing me
for taking your side

17:50.127 --> 17:53.086
and going against her,
so she moved me down here

17:53.086 --> 17:55.211
and gave my office
to that little

17:55.211 --> 17:57.294
brownnosing shit, Ed Chen.

17:57.294 --> 17:59.961
Anyway, Richard,
you're not gonna
seriously go home

17:59.961 --> 18:01.461
and tell the guys
in your company

18:01.461 --> 18:03.836
that even though your
user rates are skyrocketing

18:03.836 --> 18:04.920
that you wanna pivot.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.503
For the past 48 hours,

18:06.503 --> 18:09.086
I've been trying to rewrite
the core video chat code,

18:09.086 --> 18:10.544
and I literally can't.

18:10.544 --> 18:12.920
Instead of typing,
I just bite my fingernails.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.461
I think, subconsciously,

18:14.461 --> 18:18.002
I would rather bite
my own fingers off
than work on this platform.

18:18.002 --> 18:19.795
Richard, I know people
who have spent

18:19.795 --> 18:21.878
their entire careers
chasing after an app

18:21.878 --> 18:24.294
with this kind of growth rate
and never hit it.

18:24.294 --> 18:25.628
It's a really good product.

18:25.628 --> 18:28.044
That may be,
but it's not for me.

18:29.169 --> 18:31.169
And look, I know these guys
are my friends,

18:31.169 --> 18:34.920
but they're also my employees,
and it's my company.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.169
So... if I say we have
to pivot, we pivot.

18:38.169 --> 18:41.127
Okay.
I-I-- I have to go.

18:41.127 --> 18:43.920
All right. Well, if you're sure,
then tell them and then
call me and tell--

18:43.920 --> 18:45.336
What? No, I--
I have to go.

18:45.336 --> 18:48.795
There's another men's room
on the fourth floor.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.086
Right. 'Cause then you would've
seen mine twice.

18:56.544 --> 18:59.419
I mean, we're all
thinking it, right?

18:59.419 --> 19:02.336
Richard is
fucking with a product
that is working.

19:02.336 --> 19:05.044
He should not be the CEO
of this company.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.961
I understand
your concerns,

19:06.961 --> 19:09.711
but is this the time
that we fire Richard?

19:09.711 --> 19:12.044
Is this the moment
that I become the CEO?

19:12.044 --> 19:13.461
You? Why you?

19:13.461 --> 19:16.378
It's a simple process
of elimination.

19:16.378 --> 19:18.044
Gilfoyle,
as an anarchist

19:18.044 --> 19:20.211
would never accept
a position of authority

19:20.211 --> 19:22.961
in any official
organization.
None.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.795
And you, of course,
are out of the picture,

19:24.795 --> 19:26.711
because Gilfoyle would
never allow it.

19:26.711 --> 19:28.002
Yeah, that's true.

19:28.002 --> 19:31.836
And Jared,
he'd sooner commit
hara-kiri than...

19:31.836 --> 19:33.920
replace little baby Richard.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.086
So that leaves me.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.795
And honestly, gents,
who would you rather have

19:36.795 --> 19:39.753
defending your four percent
stake in the company--

19:39.753 --> 19:41.044
Five.
What?

19:41.044 --> 19:43.086
Five percent.
You said four.
Was it--

19:43.086 --> 19:44.753
You said three,
and then you had--

19:44.753 --> 19:46.419
- No, it's five.
- Five.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.169
You know what?
I'm gonna back channel,

19:48.169 --> 19:51.461
look at some notes,
and we'll get to it.

19:51.461 --> 19:55.252
In the meantime,
if and when...

19:55.252 --> 19:58.711
we are to depose Richard,
I am his obvious heir.

19:58.711 --> 19:59.920
Erlich, no offense,

19:59.920 --> 20:04.419
but the board
is you, Richard,
and my dad, right?

20:04.419 --> 20:07.044
So, I think that means
you and my dad

20:07.044 --> 20:10.002
would have to agree
on who replaces Richard,

20:10.002 --> 20:12.878
and pretty sure my dad would,
like, never approve you.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.461
It's just
not gonna happen.
Thank you.

20:14.461 --> 20:17.002
Yeah.
There is someone else.

20:18.211 --> 20:20.628
Someone who has
zero strikes against him.

20:20.628 --> 20:23.044
Someone who has held
high-level positions

20:23.044 --> 20:25.628
at one of the biggest
tech companies in the Valley.

20:27.461 --> 20:28.920
Someone who's been
on the cover

20:28.920 --> 20:32.461
of one of the most prestigious
tech publications in the world.

20:34.294 --> 20:35.378
He sounds awesome.

20:35.378 --> 20:36.795
Could we get him?

20:40.211 --> 20:42.127
And as of now,
we've got the votes...

20:42.127 --> 20:43.836
of enough key
Malaysian ministers

20:43.836 --> 20:45.419
to proceed
with construction,

20:45.419 --> 20:47.419
but that support
is time-critical.

20:47.419 --> 20:50.378
Carol's right.
We'd have to break ground
before monsoon season

20:50.378 --> 20:53.294
or else the entire project
could collapse.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.795
So, what do you think?

20:58.586 --> 21:00.628
Sorry. About what?

21:00.628 --> 21:02.378
About the factory.

21:02.378 --> 21:04.211
Ah. The factory.

21:05.753 --> 21:06.836
The factory.

21:09.169 --> 21:10.628
Excuse me for a moment.

21:13.127 --> 21:15.711
So, what have you got?
Well, sir, I did
as you asked.

21:15.711 --> 21:17.836
I flew the company plane
to Shanghai,

21:17.836 --> 21:19.753
then Moffett,
then Jackson Hole.

21:19.753 --> 21:22.961
Then I flew back to Shanghai,
then to Jackson Hole,

21:22.961 --> 21:25.669
then to Moffett,
which is where I just landed.

21:25.669 --> 21:30.002
And?
Moffett is
28.3 minutes closer.

21:30.002 --> 21:32.586
I fucking knew it!
Barker should've
dropped you off first, sir.

21:32.586 --> 21:36.169
Wait. What about headwinds
or storm activity?

21:36.169 --> 21:38.544
I don't want to give him
any room to wriggle out of this.

21:38.544 --> 21:39.836
Here's what I'm gonna
need you to do.

21:39.836 --> 21:42.628
Fly each leg five more times
and average them.

21:42.628 --> 21:44.002
It's the only way
to be sure.

21:44.002 --> 21:45.544
And we're not concerned
with the expense

21:45.544 --> 21:47.628
of 20 more private
transcontinental flights?

21:47.628 --> 21:48.795
Of course we are.

21:48.795 --> 21:50.669
Jack Barker is costing
the shareholders

21:50.669 --> 21:53.711
of this company a fortune,
and he must be stopped.

21:53.711 --> 21:55.211
I'll go back
to Moffett right now.

21:55.211 --> 21:56.920
Good. Call me each time
you're in Shanghai.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.544
I'll see you in a week.
Yes, sir.

22:13.544 --> 22:14.544
Guys?

22:14.544 --> 22:16.044
Shit, he came
in the back.

22:18.544 --> 22:20.169
Richard, we need
to talk.

22:20.169 --> 22:22.920
Well, actually,
let me just say
something first here.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.461
I don't think Pied Piper
should be a video chat company.

22:27.461 --> 22:29.169
The balls on you.

22:29.169 --> 22:31.461
Richard,
we've all decided

22:31.461 --> 22:35.294
you are out.
Big Head is in.

22:35.294 --> 22:38.878
Not my call.
Richard, we just can't
keep fucking pivoting.

22:38.878 --> 22:40.836
We won't do it again.
Just wait
for a second, okay?

22:40.836 --> 22:42.378
Just-- You're not
getting it. Please.

22:42.378 --> 22:44.294
Uh, I'm quitting.

22:45.961 --> 22:47.419
Wait. What?

22:47.419 --> 22:49.419
Richard, I was
waiting out front!

22:49.419 --> 22:51.336
They want to ambush you
and replace you with Big Head,

22:51.336 --> 22:52.795
but I had nothing
to do with it.

22:52.795 --> 22:54.586
Again, not my call.

22:56.836 --> 22:58.753
I was ready
to fight you guys,

22:58.753 --> 23:01.961
but then,
on the way home,
it occurred to me

23:01.961 --> 23:03.127
there might be
a better way.

23:04.294 --> 23:05.836
I'm going to start
my own company.

23:05.836 --> 23:09.628
I will give up
all of my equity
in the video chat

23:09.628 --> 23:14.336
if I get
to completely own
my algorithm.

23:14.336 --> 23:17.211
I will grant you guys
a perpetual license

23:17.211 --> 23:19.044
to use the algorithm
in your video chat,

23:19.044 --> 23:22.169
but I need the algorithm
to build something else.

23:22.169 --> 23:24.252
And look,
forget a million users,

23:24.252 --> 23:25.586
with me out
of the company,

23:25.586 --> 23:27.711
you guys would be able
to raise money, no problem.

23:27.711 --> 23:29.419
And that way,
everybody wins.

23:29.419 --> 23:33.836
So we can use the algorithm,
free and clear, for video chat?

23:33.836 --> 23:37.544
Yes.
I mean, we-- we shouldn't
even be talking about this.

23:37.544 --> 23:40.294
And you would leave behind
your 25 percent,

23:40.294 --> 23:44.669
thus giving me enough equity
to compensate the boys fairly

23:44.669 --> 23:47.127
and Big Head's father would
retain his 50 percent?

23:47.127 --> 23:48.419
I think that's right. Yes.

23:48.419 --> 23:50.669
And I would own 10 percent
of your new company.

23:50.669 --> 23:53.669
Wait. What? Why?
The algorithm was developed
here in the Incubator.

23:53.669 --> 23:55.002
Richard, shame on you.

23:55.002 --> 23:58.544
Well, dealbreaker. Let's--
Should we get some food?

23:58.544 --> 24:00.544
No, no.
That's okay.
It's fine.

24:00.544 --> 24:02.628
And I'm here
for advice,

24:02.628 --> 24:05.336
or advice
for the new CEO,
whoever that may be.

24:05.336 --> 24:07.127
To wit, uh...

24:07.127 --> 24:09.211
I know it's probably
not my place to give
this suggestion,

24:09.211 --> 24:11.336
but I think
it should be Dinesh.

24:11.336 --> 24:12.669
What?
What?

24:12.669 --> 24:14.044
What?
What?

24:14.044 --> 24:15.920
Yeah. Sorry, Big Head.
What?

24:15.920 --> 24:17.836
Yeah. Dinesh, you were
the one that hacked together

24:17.836 --> 24:19.169
the video chat
in the first place.

24:19.169 --> 24:20.836
You know the product
inside and out.

24:20.836 --> 24:23.211
You are the horse
that I would bet on.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.586
You really think so?

24:24.586 --> 24:25.878
I do.

24:25.878 --> 24:28.252
I'm down. Gilfoyle?

24:29.378 --> 24:33.544
Gilfoyle, can I please be
CEO of Pied Piper?

24:33.544 --> 24:35.211
Spoken like a true leader.

24:35.211 --> 24:40.461
But since
your failure as a leader
is a virtual certainty,

24:40.461 --> 24:42.878
tolerating your
short reign as CEO

24:42.878 --> 24:46.961
in exchange for a front-row seat
to the disaster seems fair.

24:46.961 --> 24:49.878
Plus, if I'm wrong,
which I'm not...

24:49.878 --> 24:52.503
I get rich.
So I'm down
with it, Dinesh.

24:52.503 --> 24:54.086
Jared, what do you
think about this?

24:54.086 --> 24:56.586
I think
this is crazy.

24:56.586 --> 24:59.461
I left my job
at Hooli to-- to come work
with you, Richard.

24:59.461 --> 25:00.961
And-- and now you're leaving?

25:00.961 --> 25:02.836
Look, these guys,
they're gonna need you,

25:02.836 --> 25:05.836
so if you want
to support me,
you support them.

25:05.836 --> 25:07.628
Think you can do that?

25:07.628 --> 25:09.127
I've always been
very adept

25:09.127 --> 25:12.419
at taking
the shape of whatever shoe
was pressed down upon me,

25:12.419 --> 25:14.628
so I can try
to make it work.

25:14.628 --> 25:15.753
Then it's settled.

25:15.753 --> 25:18.169
Dinesh is the new CEO
of Pied Piper.

25:18.169 --> 25:21.252
Oh. Actually,
just one last thing.

25:21.252 --> 25:24.044
I think you guys should
call yourselves PiperChat.

25:24.044 --> 25:27.836
I'm gonna have to insist that
I keep the name Pied Piper,
and I won't budge on that.

25:27.836 --> 25:29.920
Yeah, it's totally fine.
Okay, yeah.
Who gives a shit?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.586
That's fine.
Terrible fucking name.

25:31.586 --> 25:33.419
Let's get to work.

25:34.586 --> 25:36.127
Congratulations.

25:36.127 --> 25:38.920
So, wait. I don't
have to be CEO, right?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.544
Dinesh is
going to do that?

25:42.211 --> 25:44.878
All right. Let's figure out
how this gets split up.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.002
Let's see.

25:48.002 --> 25:50.669
And, um... yeah.

25:50.669 --> 25:52.628
Jared...

25:52.628 --> 25:53.628
...go.

25:54.628 --> 25:55.669
Go on, man.

25:56.669 --> 25:57.836
Get out of here.

25:59.961 --> 26:02.169
Dinesh, you'll get
five percent.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.127
Gilfoyle, five percent.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.795
- Jared, five percent.
- Yeah. Okay,

26:05.795 --> 26:07.669
so we all get five,
not four.

26:07.669 --> 26:09.628
Now you said--
you said four?

26:09.628 --> 26:11.252
- No, five.
- I said five.

26:12.252 --> 26:14.169
Jared, can we get
five more engineers?

26:14.169 --> 26:17.002
That's--
That would come out
of Jared's percentage.

26:17.002 --> 26:18.961
No.

26:40.503 --> 26:42.169
You wanted
to see me, Skipper?

26:42.169 --> 26:43.628
I did indeed.

26:43.628 --> 26:46.169
Jack, I appreciate
everything you've done

26:46.169 --> 26:48.378
in your position as head
of the Hooli/Endframe box,

26:48.378 --> 26:51.836
but I think
the company's needs
are better suited

26:51.836 --> 26:54.044
if I move you elsewhere.

26:54.044 --> 26:56.544
Really?

26:56.544 --> 26:58.961
Well, I appreciate
the vote of confidence, GB.

26:58.961 --> 27:01.127
I'm flattered.

27:01.127 --> 27:03.795
Frankly,
little bit surprised.

27:03.795 --> 27:05.836
Why would you be surprised?
Can you think of any reason

27:05.836 --> 27:07.503
why you don't deserve
a promotion?

27:07.503 --> 27:09.086
I mean, anything at all?
Well...

27:09.086 --> 27:12.378
I don't want to hurt my arm
patting myself on the back,

27:12.378 --> 27:14.878
but... right off
the top of my head...

27:17.544 --> 27:18.961
No, I guess not.

27:18.961 --> 27:21.628
I mean, you've always been
straight with me, right?

27:21.628 --> 27:23.628
Straight to the point.

27:23.628 --> 27:24.836
I sure have.

27:24.836 --> 27:29.002
And you've always gone out
of your way for me, yes?

27:29.002 --> 27:32.211
Always put me first?
Gone the extra mile?

27:32.211 --> 27:35.753
Gosh...
I sure tried.

27:35.753 --> 27:37.002
Did you?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.211
All right, Jack.

27:42.211 --> 27:44.252
Professor. Gary in HR
will set you up.

27:44.252 --> 27:46.252
Enjoy your new offices.

27:46.252 --> 27:48.002
Thank you, sir.

28:31.086 --> 28:34.461
Oh, hey. Would you like
to see your desk?

28:34.461 --> 28:35.920
Okay.

28:50.002 --> 28:51.336

Check it out! Bloomberg
just posted it!

30:26.711 --> 30:28.544
How did I come up with
PiperChat?

30:28.544 --> 30:30.419
Do you think I have too much
product in my hair?

30:30.419 --> 30:32.127
Nope.
I think you should use more.

30:32.336 --> 30:33.878
Are you saying that because
you think I look

30:33.878 --> 30:36.419
ridiculous and you want me
to look more ridiculous?

30:36.419 --> 30:38.711
Which answer will get more
of that stuff on your hair?

30:40.920 --> 30:43.503
I haven't slept in days.
This is all I think about.

30:43.503 --> 30:44.461
What brings you in today?

30:45.044 --> 30:46.503
Well, I've just been working
on this internet thing.

30:46.503 --> 30:47.127
Just one second.

30:47.503 --> 30:48.419
Why are you writing it on there?

30:49.211 --> 30:50.961
Oh, I mean you change these
between every patient, right?

30:50.961 --> 30:52.336
Guess I'm gonna have to now.

30:53.086 --> 30:55.086
I have got to get in on this.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.628
Richie, I will not phone it in.

30:56.628 --> 30:58.753
I'll be the first one here
at 10:30 a.m.,

30:58.753 --> 31:01.252
and the last one to leave
a smidge after four.

31:02.544 --> 31:04.795
Richard, what we're doing
is highly risky.

31:05.336 --> 31:06.586
I'm not going down
without a fight.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.211
What's going on?
How serious is this?

31:09.753 --> 31:12.753
Ah, I couldn't sleep last night.
So, I baked a bunch of muffins,

31:12.753 --> 31:13.669
but then I wasn't hungry.

31:14.127 --> 31:15.252
I threw them in the trash,
so if anyone...

31:15.628 --> 31:16.920
needs muffins,
there's some in the trash.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.086
Let's have fun, huh?
