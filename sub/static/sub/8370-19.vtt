_

01:01.057 --> 01:02.519
__

01:07.437 --> 01:11.307
And then,
out of the darkness

01:11.337 --> 01:14.377
came a bone-chilling noise.

01:15.377 --> 01:17.047
What was it?

01:17.077 --> 01:20.347
Hmm. Are young ones
like you ready?

01:20.377 --> 01:24.187
It is a story that will make
your fur stand up straight.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.347
Oh, we are, we are!

01:25.387 --> 01:28.187
Tell us the story, Rafiki!
Please?

01:28.227 --> 01:30.087
Yeah!
We wanna hear it!

01:30.127 --> 01:32.257
We all want to hear
the story, Rafiki.

01:32.297 --> 01:34.397
Very well. Where was I?

01:34.427 --> 01:37.127
Ah, yes.

01:37.167 --> 01:41.067
They heard
a bone-chilling noise,

01:41.097 --> 01:43.467
the call of the Zimwi.

01:43.507 --> 01:45.507
What's a Zimwi?

01:45.537 --> 01:48.377
The Zimwi is
a terrifying beast!

01:50.277 --> 01:53.207
But it only comes into the Pride
Lands on the night of the full moon.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.247
Hey, tonight's a full moon!

01:58.287 --> 01:59.447
Huh!

01:59.487 --> 02:01.317
So it is.

02:01.357 --> 02:04.187
Then, it is on
a night like tonight

02:04.227 --> 02:07.127
that you might hear
the Zimwi's call.

02:09.026 --> 02:10.127
What was that?

02:10.167 --> 02:12.397
Was that...
The Zimwi?

02:15.407 --> 02:18.207
Whoever you are, come out
and show yourself!

02:20.037 --> 02:23.037
You heard me! Come out!

02:23.077 --> 02:27.017
Kion? Oh!
Uh, hey, everybody.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.477
I thought I recognized
that bellow.

02:28.517 --> 02:32.447
Me too. But why are
you bellowing so late?

02:32.487 --> 02:34.257
I need to practice.

02:34.287 --> 02:37.127
Tomorrow I'll be bellowing
for the Bellow Fellows.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.057
"Bellow Fellows"?

02:39.097 --> 02:42.097
Uh, that sounds... Nice.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.497
<i>It's poa!</i>

02:43.527 --> 02:47.467
If they like me, I'll get to
bellow all the time with them!

02:47.497 --> 02:49.437
It's gonna be so much fun!

02:49.467 --> 02:53.507
But, uh, I'm kinda nervous
to bellow in front of 'em.

02:53.537 --> 02:56.137
Hmm, yes, yes.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.347
I suppose this is much more
interesting than the Zimwi.

02:59.377 --> 03:01.377
Wait, Rafiki! Don't go!

03:01.417 --> 03:03.347
We wanna hear
about the Zimwi!

03:03.387 --> 03:05.347
Is that so?

03:05.387 --> 03:08.057
And you are sure
you're not too frightened?

03:08.087 --> 03:09.157
I'm not scared!

03:09.187 --> 03:11.027
- Tell us, Rafiki!
- Yeah!

03:12.427 --> 03:14.327
Very well!

It is just a story.
Right, Rafiki?

04:52.457 --> 04:55.097
Mmm? Who is to say?

04:55.127 --> 04:58.067
Now, off to bed you go.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.097
<i>Thanks for the story, Rafiki.</i>

05:00.137 --> 05:04.237
Yes, yes. Sleep tight.
Don't let the Zimwi bite.

05:09.077 --> 05:13.047
The Zimwi can't be real, uh, can it?

05:13.077 --> 05:15.217
Eight legs? Each one
bigger than the last?

05:15.247 --> 05:17.987
Does that sound real, guys?

05:18.017 --> 05:19.117
- No way.
- Nope.

05:19.157 --> 05:21.417
- Just a story.
- I hope so.

05:21.457 --> 05:24.357
That's too bad. I'd kinda
like to meet the Zimwi.

05:27.057 --> 05:28.457
Oh, no.

05:28.497 --> 05:30.856
- Huh?
- Ah! Zimwi?

05:31.267 --> 05:33.227
Bunga, it's only the wind.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.397
- Of course.
- Right.

05:34.437 --> 05:37.067
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

05:37.107 --> 05:38.367
If you guys are that worried,

05:38.407 --> 05:40.407
maybe you should
all stay together tonight.

05:40.437 --> 05:42.137
You'll feel safer.

05:42.177 --> 05:43.337
Okay.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.047
Whew. Good idea.

05:45.077 --> 05:47.077
Might even be fun.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.177
That does sound fun.

05:49.217 --> 05:51.187
Maybe we can
do that, too.

05:51.217 --> 05:55.157
Hey, yeah! We can all spend the
night at Hakuna Matata Falls.

05:55.187 --> 05:57.357
I'm sure my uncles won't mind.
Sure.

05:57.387 --> 05:59.157
Fine by me.
I'm in.

05:59.197 --> 06:01.957
<i>Yeah. That sounds poa!</i>

06:05.467 --> 06:07.297
Oh, sorry.

06:12.007 --> 06:14.437
<i>Hey, Big B, that one
sounded like Uncle Pumbaa!</i>

06:25.487 --> 06:27.257
Ahhh! The Zimwi!

06:27.287 --> 06:29.287
Zimwi!

06:29.327 --> 06:31.127
- Zimwi?
- Where?

06:32.197 --> 06:33.157
<i>Ah!</i>

06:41.497 --> 06:44.067
<i>- Kion! Kion!
- Hmm?</i>

06:44.107 --> 06:45.437
You gotta help us!

06:45.477 --> 06:48.931
- What? What's wrong?
- It's the Zimwi!

06:48.966 --> 06:52.047
It's in the Pride Lands!
I just saw it!

06:52.077 --> 06:54.347
The Zimwi?
That's impossible.

06:54.377 --> 06:57.487
No, it's really true!
Help us!

06:57.517 --> 07:00.047
Zimwi?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.357
In the Pride Lands?

07:01.387 --> 07:05.227
The Zimwi doesn't exist.
It's just a story!

07:05.257 --> 07:07.157
You must've seen
some other animal.

07:07.197 --> 07:09.197
You really saw it?

07:09.227 --> 07:13.067
In the woodlands. It was
as tall as two giraffes!

07:13.097 --> 07:15.167
Just like Rafiki said!

07:15.207 --> 07:18.267
And its teeth were
sharper than a crocodile's!

07:18.307 --> 07:20.137
They were?

07:20.177 --> 07:24.247
For the last time, there's
no such thing as a Zimwi.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.077
I'm scared! What if it eats all of us?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.017
Oh, maybe it is real.

07:36.327 --> 07:38.187
Now that I have
your attention,

07:38.227 --> 07:41.397
let an expert tell you
all about the Zimwi.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.097
You know about the Zimwi,
Uncle Timon?

07:44.127 --> 07:47.367
Know about it? Timon's the
only animal in the Pride Lands

07:47.397 --> 07:49.997
to survive an
encounter with...

07:50.037 --> 07:51.167
<i>The Zimwi!</i>

07:51.207 --> 07:53.007
So, it's not just a story!

07:53.037 --> 07:54.407
You've both seen
the Zimwi?

07:54.437 --> 07:57.007
Oh, Timon has!
Right, Timon?

07:57.047 --> 07:59.007
Ha! You better believe it!

07:59.047 --> 08:00.347
More or less.

08:01.417 --> 08:03.147
"More or less"?

08:03.187 --> 08:05.087
Well, not exactly me.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.317
See, my Ma's cousin's
friend knows an ox

08:07.357 --> 08:09.957
who told him he ran
into the Zimwi!

08:09.987 --> 08:12.387
And it ate him!

08:12.427 --> 08:16.246
- Oh, the horror!
- Oh, no!

08:17.197 --> 08:22.097
Wait! If the ox got eaten, how
did he tell anyone else the story?

08:22.137 --> 08:24.967
Ooh, good question.
Timon?

08:25.007 --> 08:27.007
Uh, you'd have to ask the ox.

08:27.037 --> 08:32.207
The point is,
nothing can stop the Zimwi!

08:32.246 --> 08:34.417
Ah! What are
we gonna do?

08:34.447 --> 08:36.217
Nothing you can do, kid.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.246
Maybe there's nothing
he can do,

08:38.287 --> 08:40.217
but we're the Lion Guard.

08:40.256 --> 08:42.287
We'll find
whatever you saw.

08:42.327 --> 08:44.327
And if it really is the Zimwi,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.457
we'll run it out
of the Pride Lands!

08:46.497 --> 08:49.197
Yeah! Or get eaten trying!

08:51.067 --> 08:57.067
Oh! Why does our little
Bunga have to be so brave?

08:57.107 --> 08:59.467
Let's go.
Till the Pride Lands end...

08:59.507 --> 09:02.407
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

09:02.447 --> 09:06.307
Even if we're just defending
everyone from Rafiki's silly story.

09:06.347 --> 09:10.077
I hope you're right
about that.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.187
<i>Here, Zimwi, Zimwi, Zimwi.</i>

09:13.217 --> 09:15.257
<i>Here, Zimwi, Zimwi, Zimwi.</i>

09:15.287 --> 09:18.322
Come on, Bunga.
You really think there's

09:18.323 --> 09:21.357
a creature out here that's
as tall as two giraffes

09:21.397 --> 09:25.327
with big spikes, and teeth
sharper than a crocodile?

09:25.367 --> 09:27.967
Yeah! Don't forget
the eight legs!

09:27.997 --> 09:29.967
You believe it too,
don't ya, Big B?

09:30.007 --> 09:33.067
I don't know, Bunga. I've
never seen anything like that.

09:33.107 --> 09:36.007
But there's probably lots
of things I've never seen.

09:36.047 --> 09:37.977
I see a lot more
than you guys do.

09:38.007 --> 09:41.077
And I still haven't seen everything.
So, who knows?

09:41.117 --> 09:44.147
Come on, Kion.
Isn't it possible?

09:44.187 --> 09:45.417
Mmm, no.

09:45.457 --> 09:48.317
We'll find whatever
it is those animals saw,

09:48.357 --> 09:51.027
and then you'll see
it's not a Zimwi.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.257
So, you think
it's something worse?

09:56.127 --> 09:58.097
Come on! Come on! We can't
let this thing get away.

09:58.127 --> 09:59.467
Actually, would
that be so bad?

10:06.077 --> 10:07.307
<i>Hapana!</i>

10:09.477 --> 10:12.277
Oh, excuse us.
Did we scare you?

10:12.317 --> 10:15.117
Me? Why, uh, no!

10:15.147 --> 10:17.347
Hey, little genets.
Where are you guys off to?

10:17.387 --> 10:20.087
- Just heading home.
- Good thinkin'.

10:20.117 --> 10:23.087
Get home before
the Zimwi gets ya.

10:23.127 --> 10:25.287
Zimwi? What's a Zimwi?

10:25.327 --> 10:28.357
You've never heard
of the Zimwi? It's...

10:28.397 --> 10:30.057
It's nothing!

10:30.097 --> 10:35.037
Pfft, yeah. If something as
tall as two giraffes is nothing!

10:35.067 --> 10:37.507
- Two giraffes?
- Bunga?

10:37.537 --> 10:41.237
If nothing has teeth
bigger than a crocodile's.

10:41.277 --> 10:43.237
Then yeah, sure!
The Zimwi's nothing!

10:43.277 --> 10:46.107
Huh! Teeth bigger
than a crocodile's?

10:46.147 --> 10:47.377
Bunga! Enough!

10:47.417 --> 10:49.117
Speaking of enough,

10:49.147 --> 10:51.087
you'd think four legs
is enough,

10:51.117 --> 10:53.087
but not for the Zimwi!

10:53.117 --> 10:55.287
He's got eight!

10:57.187 --> 11:00.387
Don't worry, okay? We're not
even sure the Zimwi's real.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.457
Yeah.
For all we know it could be

11:02.497 --> 11:05.297
some other eight-legged,
super tall, sharp-toothed thing

11:05.337 --> 11:07.337
stalking through
the Pride Lands tonight.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.167
We really have
to get back.

11:09.207 --> 11:12.237
Good idea!
The Lion Guard's on duty!

11:12.277 --> 11:15.137
So, go on home and
get a good night's sleep.

11:15.177 --> 11:18.107
I don't see
that happening. Let's go!

11:18.147 --> 11:20.347
Hey, wait!

11:20.377 --> 11:22.317
If you do see the Zimwi,

11:22.347 --> 11:25.147
try to keep it where it is
till we get there, okay?

11:25.187 --> 11:27.117
Then leave
the rest to us.

11:29.157 --> 11:30.357
Think they'll do it?

11:30.387 --> 11:34.197
I doubt it. Bunga, why did
you scare them like that?

11:34.227 --> 11:37.097
Yeah, Little B. You
really got 'em on the run.

11:37.127 --> 11:39.497
What? I was tryin'
to make 'em feel safe!

11:39.537 --> 11:43.337
But they hadn't even heard of the
Zimwi til you told them about it.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.167
How was
I supposed to know?

11:46.477 --> 11:48.237
Okay, Bunga.

11:48.277 --> 11:50.207
But the next animal
we run into,

11:50.247 --> 11:52.047
try not to mention the Zimwi.

11:52.077 --> 11:54.247
No Zimwi. You got it.

11:59.357 --> 12:02.287
I have to admit, hearing
Bunga describe the Zimwi

12:02.327 --> 12:04.087
has me a little
on edge, too.

12:04.127 --> 12:08.127
Well, hopefully Kion's right
and it's just a story after all.

12:08.157 --> 12:10.397
Um, he probably is.
Just listen.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.367
Everything's peaceful and quiet.

12:13.397 --> 12:16.467
Yeah. A little too quiet...

12:16.507 --> 12:18.037
Ah! I take it back.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.337
Quiet's fine!
Quiet's fine!

12:19.377 --> 12:21.477
Panic and run!

12:21.507 --> 12:24.037
Panic and run!

12:25.177 --> 12:26.207
Panic and run!

12:26.247 --> 12:29.247
Panic and run!

12:29.287 --> 12:34.017
Hey there, it's okay.
It's okay, calm down.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.457
Calm down and trot.
Calm down and trot.

12:36.487 --> 12:39.387
What's got you all upset?
Isn't it obvious?

12:39.427 --> 12:41.357
He's panicked about the Zimwi!

12:41.397 --> 12:43.027
Oops. I said Zimwi.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.297
Oops. Said it again!

12:44.327 --> 12:48.467
The Zimwi? Why should
I panic about the Zimwi?

12:48.497 --> 12:50.367
You're not afraid
of the Zimwi?

12:50.407 --> 12:55.077
Why would I be? Everyone
knows it's just a story.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.137
Right?

12:56.177 --> 12:58.047
Right! Thank you!

12:58.077 --> 13:00.347
Yes. To think
that I'd panic and run

13:00.377 --> 13:02.977
over a creature
that doesn't even exist.

13:03.017 --> 13:06.287
How silly!

13:06.317 --> 13:10.387
Okay, but if you're not
running from the Zimwi,

13:10.427 --> 13:12.257
what are
you running from?

13:12.297 --> 13:15.297
Hmm. What was I?

13:15.327 --> 13:19.467
Ooh! I remember!
It was genets!

13:19.497 --> 13:22.397
There were three of them!
Running wild!

13:22.437 --> 13:27.037
So small and furry,
with long tails!

13:27.077 --> 13:30.177
Panic and run!

13:30.207 --> 13:33.447
Panic and run... At least
he's not afraid of the Zimwi.

13:33.477 --> 13:36.377
Yeah. Come on, everybody.

13:44.457 --> 13:49.351
- Just an owl, guys.
- Is it, Kion? Or is it the Zimwi

13:49.386 --> 13:52.297
laughing right before it
eats some unsuspecting animal?

13:52.337 --> 13:55.267
Bunga.

13:55.297 --> 13:56.397
<i> Hapana!</i>

13:56.437 --> 13:57.397
What?
Zimwi?

13:59.277 --> 14:02.207
Sorry. I was
practicing my bellows.

14:02.247 --> 14:04.347
You know,
for the Bellow Fellows?

14:04.377 --> 14:09.217
See?
Just Beshte. No Zimwi.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.117
I'm not sure which is
spookier, Beshte.

14:16.157 --> 14:17.357
The Zimwi, or you!

14:26.337 --> 14:30.367
Still no sign of the Zimwi.

14:30.407 --> 14:32.237
<i>Or... Or whatever it is.</i>

14:34.507 --> 14:36.037
Huh?

14:38.107 --> 14:39.377
Anyone else feel...

14:39.417 --> 14:41.277
Really scared? Not me!

14:41.317 --> 14:44.017
No. Like we're
being watched.

14:44.047 --> 14:46.287
By the Zimwi?
Usually I do the watching.

14:46.317 --> 14:48.287
Who'd watch us?
Where?

14:48.317 --> 14:51.187
Shh. Over there.
In the bushes.

14:53.097 --> 14:56.327
Ooh, how many eyes does
the Zimwi have?

14:56.367 --> 14:58.297
<i>Too many.</i>

14:58.327 --> 15:00.327
All right, team, let's move in.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.397
Ono, keep
an eye out overhead.

15:02.437 --> 15:04.237
Uh, affirmative.

15:13.077 --> 15:14.047
Shh.

15:26.457 --> 15:29.197
Now!

15:29.227 --> 15:31.197
We got you, Zimwi!

15:31.227 --> 15:34.167
- The Zimwi can fly?
- Gazelles?

15:34.197 --> 15:37.437
Don't hurt us!
Please! We were just hiding!

15:37.467 --> 15:40.137
This is what we've
been chasing?

15:40.177 --> 15:42.007
So, what are you
hiding from?

15:42.037 --> 15:44.037
- What else?
- The Zimwi!

15:44.077 --> 15:47.347
Listen. I don't think
the Zimwi's really real.

15:47.377 --> 15:50.247
But we saw it. Right before
we jumped into the bushes.

15:50.287 --> 15:51.447
It had giant teeth!

15:51.487 --> 15:54.017
On the outside
of its head!

15:54.057 --> 15:57.317
<i>Hapana! We've heard those teeth
are as sharp as a crocodile's.</i>

15:57.357 --> 16:00.287
We heard it can fly!
You heard that, too?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.357
They heard it from you!

16:02.397 --> 16:05.127
Relax. The Zimwi's
just a story.

16:05.167 --> 16:08.267
Oh, yeah?
So, what's that?

16:12.167 --> 16:14.437
Maybe this thing really
is as tall as two giraffes.

16:14.477 --> 16:16.337
Those sure look
like big teeth.

16:16.377 --> 16:20.047
- Anyone else see two heads?
- Uh, maybe?

16:21.477 --> 16:24.347
Whatever it is,
it's on the move.

16:26.157 --> 16:29.057
I hope that's
you practicing again, Beshte.

16:29.087 --> 16:30.387
I don't think so.

16:30.427 --> 16:32.227
Come on,
Lion Guard, let's go.

16:34.097 --> 16:37.257
This ravine's a dead end
so it's got nowhere to run.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.167
And that's a good thing?

16:42.507 --> 16:43.467
Anyone see anything?

16:47.337 --> 16:50.037
<i>- Zimwi!
- I knew it.</i>

16:50.077 --> 16:51.147
Run!

16:57.247 --> 17:00.987
All right, Zimwi,
it's just you and me.

17:01.017 --> 17:03.257
Let's go, Little B!
Whoa!

17:08.127 --> 17:09.997
Look out!

17:15.037 --> 17:18.267
Lion Guard! We've gotta get
these gazelles under control!

17:18.307 --> 17:20.137
How are we gonna do that?

17:22.077 --> 17:23.277
We get them out
in the open.

17:23.307 --> 17:25.207
That way they can't
hurt themselves!

17:25.247 --> 17:27.047
Beshte, flatten
those bushes!

17:27.077 --> 17:29.047
Make an opening
to the clearing.

17:29.087 --> 17:31.087
You got it, Kion.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.987
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

17:34.487 --> 17:37.287
Let's round them up.
This way.

17:37.327 --> 17:39.227
Careful!
Watch the branches!

17:40.457 --> 17:42.057
And you watch your horns!

17:43.067 --> 17:44.427
Come on, gazelles!

17:53.307 --> 17:55.307
They should wear themselves
out in a little bit.

17:55.337 --> 17:59.277
Gazelles, right? One little
scare and before you know it,

17:59.317 --> 18:01.317
they're just jumping
all over the place.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.077
Because we scared them.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.287
While we were running away.

18:07.317 --> 18:10.417
Sorry, Kion.
Nothing to be sorry about.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.127
I ran away, too.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.157
And you said
the Zimwi wasn't real!

18:15.197 --> 18:16.427
I know.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.267
All this time, I wasn't afraid
of the Zimwi

18:19.297 --> 18:21.297
because I thought
it wasn't real.

18:21.337 --> 18:26.107
But as soon as I thought
it was, I ran away.

18:26.137 --> 18:28.237
I can't believe
we got so scared.

18:28.277 --> 18:30.977
Listen. It's okay
to be scared.

18:31.007 --> 18:34.407
But we're the Lion Guard,
and we can't run away.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.247
Kion's right.
Affirmative.

18:37.287 --> 18:39.017
<i> Twende Kiboko.</i>

18:39.047 --> 18:40.347
That's what I've been
saying all along!

18:40.387 --> 18:43.417
Okay, time to face
the Zimwi!

18:47.057 --> 18:48.457
Till the Pride Lands end...

18:48.497 --> 18:50.457
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

18:52.027 --> 18:53.397
You don't scare us, Zimwi!

18:53.437 --> 18:56.437
That's right.
Get outta the Pride Lands!

19:02.337 --> 19:04.947
That all you got, Zimwi?

19:07.147 --> 19:08.417
What in the Pride Lands?

19:08.447 --> 19:10.177
<i>- Hapana!
- No way!</i>

19:12.287 --> 19:13.417
Lion Guard!

19:13.457 --> 19:15.317
<i>- Get it!
- Twende Kiboko!</i>

19:15.357 --> 19:18.391
<i>- Huwezi!
- Zuka Zama, Zimwi!</i>

19:18.987 --> 19:20.057
Don't hurt us!

19:23.397 --> 19:25.563
Wait. What?

19:27.067 --> 19:28.297
You're not the Zimwi!

19:28.337 --> 19:31.337
Wait. So we ran away
from two little porcupines?

19:31.367 --> 19:33.067
Looks like it.

19:33.107 --> 19:36.077
So, did you two hear
something scary

19:36.107 --> 19:39.407
- and think it was the Zimwi?
- Uh, yeah.

19:39.447 --> 19:42.267
Of course! So, you
huddled together and stuck

19:42.268 --> 19:45.087
out your quills to make
yourselves look bigger.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.087
Then the rhino saw you like that
and thought you were the Zimwi!

19:49.117 --> 19:52.327
- And so did we.
- Don't feel bad, Beshte.

19:52.357 --> 19:56.257
I think everyone was so
spooked by Rafiki's story,

19:56.297 --> 19:58.227
they were ready
to believe anything.

19:58.267 --> 20:02.097
Wait a second. What about
their ginormous Zimwi body?

20:02.137 --> 20:04.297
Over here.
Termite mound.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.007
Mmm! Termites!
Excuse me.

20:07.037 --> 20:08.407
We ran up there
when the Zimwi...

20:08.437 --> 20:10.437
I mean you guys,
were chasing us.

20:10.477 --> 20:15.247
All this time, the "Zimwi"
was just two little porcupines.

20:15.277 --> 20:18.317
See? I was right.
 It did have two heads!

20:18.347 --> 20:19.387
Mmm.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.497
So, those are the hippos
you need to bellow for?

20:33.537 --> 20:36.367
Yeah. But I'm not sure
I can do it.

20:36.407 --> 20:38.407
I'm still kinda scared.

20:38.437 --> 20:42.477
Scared of this? Beshte, last
night you faced the Zimwi!

20:42.507 --> 20:45.347
But, Kion, there was no Zimwi.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.447
You didn't know that.
And you charged in anyway.

20:48.477 --> 20:52.397
And if you can do that,
I think you can bellow

20:52.398 --> 20:56.317
- in front of a couple of hippos.
- You're right, Kion. Thanks!

20:56.357 --> 20:58.257
Now I'm ready
for that audition!

20:58.287 --> 20:59.357
Here I go.

21:18.447 --> 21:20.047
Ugh.

21:23.187 --> 21:24.317
<i> Hapana.</i>

21:34.257 --> 21:38.197
We love it!
Best ever!

21:38.227 --> 21:40.397
- Really?
- Really?

21:40.437 --> 21:45.337
Congratulations!
You're now a Bellow Fellow!

21:45.367 --> 21:47.507
You can bellow
with us any time!

21:47.537 --> 21:49.377
How about now?

21:54.077 --> 21:56.132
Now, that's scary.
