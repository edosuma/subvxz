<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:06.039 --> 00:07.240
- STUNNING.

00:07.273 --> 00:08.975

THING THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE

00:09.009 --> 00:10.276
IN THE HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY REAL ESTATE.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.145
- ALL RIGHT.
I THINK WE'VE GOT A DEAL.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.613
- AWESOME.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.015
- I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING
UNDER CONTRACT

00:15.048 --> 00:15.982
IN THE NEXT SIX
TO EIGHT WEEKS.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.385
- I HEARD ZACH CAN FIRE YOU
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.453
- YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE
SUCCESS THAT FREDRIK'S HAD

00:20.487 --> 00:22.188
ON OUR OTHER PROJECTS
DOWNTOWN,

00:22.222 --> 00:23.623
AND WE WANT TO BRING HIM
ONTO THE TEAM.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.525
- IT LOOKS LIKE
KIND OF A DEMOTION.

00:25.558 --> 00:27.193
- COMMISSION.
I'M A TEAM PLAYER.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.828
LET'S DO 50/50.
- NO, I AGREE. I MEAN--

00:28.862 --> 00:30.230
- I'M GONNA BE DOING
ALL OF THE WORK,

00:30.263 --> 00:33.033
BUT I'M STILL GONNA GIVE YOU 50%
OF THE COMMISSION.

00:33.066 --> 00:36.069
SO THIS UNIT IS JUST
UNDER 2,000 SQUARE FEET.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.303
- I CANNOT HANDLE
WORKING WITH HIM.

00:37.337 --> 00:38.972
- YOU'RE LEAVING?

00:39.005 --> 00:42.175
- IT'S JUST NOT PROFESSIONAL,
THE WAY HE'S TREATING ME.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.178
[upbeat music]

00:45.211 --> 00:51.551
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:51.584 --> 00:52.986
- I COME FROM
A REAL ESTATE FAMILY,

00:53.019 --> 00:55.655
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN CALL ME
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.091
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:58.124 --> 01:00.827
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT I
WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.063
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.
- YES, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

01:03.063 --> 01:11.071

01:16.209 --> 01:20.480
- JAB. YEAH, CRAWL. CRAWL.
YOU GOTTA USE YOUR HIPS.

01:20.513 --> 01:21.981
THAT'S WHY YOUR SECRETARY'S
DATING SOMEBODY ELSE

01:22.082 --> 01:23.316
AND NOT YOU.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.719
- [laughs]
- YOU DON'T USE YOUR HIPS.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.620
- EDDIE'S A RETIRED
ARMY RANGER,

01:27.654 --> 01:32.092
AND HE IS NOW
MY BOXING INSTRUCTOR.

01:32.092 --> 01:37.464
- JAB. JAB UPPER. OOH.
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

01:37.497 --> 01:40.100
ALL RIGHT, DO IT AGAIN.
[laughs]

01:40.100 --> 01:41.835
- AM I SCARED OF EDDIE?
YEAH.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.803
HE HAS MURDERED PEOPLE
IN THE FACE.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.105
- 'CAUSE IF THE HAND'S HERE
AND I HIT YOU,

01:45.105 --> 01:46.172
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.108
YOU HIT YOURSELF.
[laughs]

01:48.108 --> 01:50.477
[cell phone rings]
- HOLD ON.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.678
OH, COULD YOU ANSWER THIS
FOR ME, PLEASE?

01:51.711 --> 01:53.113
- NO.
[laughs]

01:53.113 --> 01:54.514
- PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE?
I CAN'T PICK IT UP.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.149
- UH, HERE WE GO,
HERE WE GO.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.717
WHICH BUTTON?
- PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.387
HELLO?

02:00.420 --> 02:02.889
HEY, YES, THIS IS RYAN.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.427
- HEY.
- NICK, HOW ARE YOU?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.461
STOP IT.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.470
OKAY.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.806
- THE BRONX, THE BRONX.
- STOP IT, I CAN'T HEAR.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.075
YOU, UH, OKAY, THREE BEDROOMS
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TWO KIDS.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.210
WHAT BUDGET ARE YOU
WORKING WITH?

02:27.881 --> 02:29.082
OKAY.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.554
OKAY, YEAH.
NO, NEXT WEEK IS PERFECT.

02:34.587 --> 02:35.989
NEXT WEEK IS PERFECT
FOR ME.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.158
SO IF YOU SHOOT ME AN EMAIL
WITH YOUR CONTACT INFO,

02:38.191 --> 02:39.693
I'LL RESPOND BACK
SO YOU HAVE MY INFO,

02:39.726 --> 02:41.127
AND THEN I'LL SEND YOU
SOME LISTINGS OVER TONIGHT

02:41.161 --> 02:43.963
THAT I THINK MIGHT WORK
REALLY WELL FOR YOU.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.198
ALL RIGHT.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.299
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

02:46.332 --> 02:50.670
- UNBELIEVABLE, BRAH.
UNBELIEVABLE.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.372
- I GOTTA PAY FOR YOU
SOMEHOW.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.611
[horn honks]

03:00.213 --> 03:03.049
- THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING
REALLY WELL LATELY AT 949 PARK.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.085
- WE WANT TO, UM, WE WANT TO
BRING HIM ONTO THE TEAM.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.286
IT'S GONNA BE A,
YOU KNOW,

03:06.319 --> 03:08.655
A NICE MATCH
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.957
- WORKING WITH FREDRIK
HAS JUST BEEN DIFFICULT.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.625
- THE INVITATION.
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.462
- VERY NICE. I LIKE
HOW MY NAME WAS LEFT OUT.

03:15.495 --> 03:16.963
- I FORGOT
TO PUT YOUR NAME IN?

03:17.063 --> 03:20.266
- SO DO YOU BOTH SHOW?
- I SHOW.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.068
- I REALLY WANT TO MEET
WITH FREDRIK TODAY

03:22.068 --> 03:24.604
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP,

03:24.637 --> 03:26.139
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

03:26.172 --> 03:29.342
- HEY, MICHAEL.
- HEY, FREDRIK.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.510
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.778
THANKS FOR COMING UPTOWN.

03:31.811 --> 03:32.846
- SO I GOT A CALL FROM MICHAEL.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.214
HE WANTS TO MEET FOR LUNCH,

03:34.247 --> 03:35.882
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.119
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE
THE PARTY AT 949 PARK.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.954
SO, WHAT'S UP?

03:40.987 --> 03:43.089
- THE REASON
I ASKED YOU HERE TODAY,

03:43.089 --> 03:46.326
I'D JUST LIKE TO TALK ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, US WORKING TOGETHER

03:46.359 --> 03:49.095
AND ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING,
GOING FORWARD.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.163
- TALK TO ME.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.664
- I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE OPPOSITES

03:51.698 --> 03:54.701
WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.170
LIKE, KIND OF JUST, YOU KNOW,
LIKE WATER AND OIL.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.172
WE'RE NOT MESHING WELL
TOGETHER.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.041
- WHY DID YOU CALL
THE MEETING?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.509
- I WOULD SAY,
AT THE PARTY,

04:02.542 --> 04:04.244
TAKING A PERSONAL
OBSERVATION I MADE

04:04.277 --> 04:05.912
ABOUT NOT LIKING
THE WALLPAPER,

04:05.945 --> 04:07.480
YOU HAD TO BRING IT UP
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,

04:07.514 --> 04:08.748
LIKE, TO PROVE A POINT.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.584
- YOU CALLED ME TO 52ND STREET
FOR A WALLPAPER?

04:11.618 --> 04:12.919
- NO, FOR A MILLION THINGS.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.187
- OKAY, WHAT IS IT?

04:14.220 --> 04:16.589
- WELL, THE INVITATION
FOR THE PARTY.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.058
- YEAH.
- I--

04:18.058 --> 04:19.659
- YOU'RE BRINGING THAT UP
AGAIN?

04:19.693 --> 04:20.660
THE PARTY IS DONE, MICHAEL.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.795
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW

04:21.828 --> 04:23.063
IS TO SELL THE UNIT
AFTER THE PARTY.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.497
- YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT WHY SHOULD I,

04:24.531 --> 04:26.099
GOING ON FORWARD,
WORKING WITH SOMEONE

04:26.132 --> 04:28.702
WHO DOESN'T HAVE THAT TYPE
OF PROFESSIONALISM?

04:28.735 --> 04:30.837
- THIS IS A CO-EXCLUSIVE.
I'M NOT GONNA BE YOUR FRIEND.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.606
I'M NOT GONNA BE
YOUR THERAPIST.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.109
- I'M JUST VOICING
MY FRUSTRATIONS,

04:36.142 --> 04:38.144
AND THIS IS HOW I WORK WELL
WITH PEOPLE.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.346
- DO YOU NEED A FRIEND?

04:39.379 --> 04:41.081
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER,
IN MY CAREER,

04:41.081 --> 04:43.883
BEEN CALLED IN TO A LUNCH
TO TALK ABOUT FEELINGS

04:43.917 --> 04:45.552
AND HOW TO WORK TOGETHER.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.153
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.121
- WHY IS IT FUNNY?

04:48.154 --> 04:50.090
- I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT I MADE YOU CRY

04:50.090 --> 04:50.990
OVER A PIECE OF WALLPAPER.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.158
I MEAN, GOD.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.560
- YEAH, I WAS CRYING
ALL NIGHT, FREDRIK.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.161
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.964
YOU'RE OVER--YOU'RE--
IT'S CONDESCENDING.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.200
- UH, I'M NOT
REALLY AGREEING.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.569
UM, YOU SEE, I ONLY HAVE
ONE OBJECTIVE

05:02.602 --> 05:04.237
AND THAT'S TO SELL
THIS PROPERTY.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.505
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.107
HE'S MY MOST IMPORTANT CLIENT.
- I KNOW.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.441
- AND I'M TRYING TO SELL IT.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.943
- PLACATING HIM--
- SITTING HERE EATING WITH YOU

05:10.043 --> 05:12.278
TO TALK ABOUT A WALLPAPER
WON'T DO ANYTHING.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.247
- WELL, HOW DOES IT WORK
FOR THE CLIENT

05:14.280 --> 05:17.317
IF I'M EXCLUDED OR,
YOU KNOW,

05:17.350 --> 05:19.119
IF MISTREATED AND SO ON?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.121
- EXCLUDED? MISTREATED?
THIS IS NOT KINDERGARTEN.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.356
- I AGREE.
- THIS IS REAL ESTATE. I MEAN--

05:23.390 --> 05:25.458
- I WASN'T INCLUDED
IN THE PLANNING OF THE PARTY,

05:25.492 --> 05:27.060
THE INVITATIONS
TO THE PARTY.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.094
I WAS JUST THERE TO, WHAT,

05:28.128 --> 05:29.362
BE YOUR BITCH
AND SHOW PEOPLE AROUND

05:29.396 --> 05:31.064
WHILE YOU KISS UP TO MY DAD
AND OTHER PEOPLE?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.066
- WHOO!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.634
MAINTAINING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH HOWARD LORBER

05:34.668 --> 05:35.935
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

05:35.969 --> 05:39.172
BUT I'M NOT GONNA HANDLE MICHAEL
WITH KID GLOVES.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.206
- IT'S NOT RIGHT.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.441
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

05:41.474 --> 05:42.842
HAND HOLD YOU,
TEACH YOU HOW TO SELL?

05:42.876 --> 05:44.844
- DID I ASK YOU HOW TO TEACH ME
HOW TO SELL A UNIT?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.946
- IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.
- WHY WOULD I NEED YOUR HELP?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.482
I MEAN, HE JUST
TREATS ME LIKE CRAP.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.451
HE'S INSULTING ME,
HE'S BELITTLING ME.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.386
HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN AT ME
LIKE I'M NOTHING.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.123
I DON'T HAVE TO WORK
WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.393
- DRINK SOME WATER.
CALM DOWN.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.029
LET'S RESOLVE THIS.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.931
LET'S SELL THE UNIT.
- YOU SELL IT.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.099
- I HAVE A SHOWING THERE
TOMORROW AT 3:00 P.M.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.100
YOU WANT TO COME?
- MAZEL TOV. NO.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.034
I'VE SEEN YOU IN ACTION.
- NO?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.336
YOU DON'T WANT TO COME
TO THE SHOWING?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.904
- NO. I DON'T WANT TO BE
INVOLVED WITH YOU ANYMORE.

06:10.937 --> 06:14.107
I THINK YOU'LL DO A GREAT JOB
BY YOURSELF, FREDRIK.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.810
IT'S YOURS.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.281
AT A CERTAIN POINT, I HAVE TO DO
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE PROPERTY.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.050
BECAUSE US FIGHTING EVERY DAY,
IT'S GONNA SHOW IN OUR WORK,

06:24.050 --> 06:28.688
AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT
FOR ZACH.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.825
- WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY?
I MEAN, GOOD-BYE.

06:31.858 --> 06:36.162
I'LL SELL THE LISTING WITH
OR WITHOUT MICHAEL LORBER.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.267
[upbeat music]

06:41.301 --> 06:45.071
* *

06:45.071 --> 06:47.507
- WORKING WITH OUT-OF-TOWNERS
CAN BE TOUGH.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.076
I MEAN, NICK AND PENELOPE ARE
ONLY IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS,

06:50.076 --> 06:51.978
SO I HAVE TO HELP THEM FIND,
YOU KNOW,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.681
THE HOME OF THEIR DREAMS
REALLY QUICKLY,

06:54.714 --> 06:56.216
SO IT'S SINK OR SWIM.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.717
THE FIRST APARTMENT
I'M GONNA SHOW THEM

06:57.751 --> 06:59.152
IS THE TRUMP WORLD TOWER,

06:59.185 --> 07:02.022
LOCATED IN THE UNITED NATIONS
PLAZA, MIDTOWN EAST.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.656
AND IN NICK AND PENELOPE'S
PRICE RANGE,

07:03.690 --> 07:05.925
IT REALLY DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THIS.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.763
- TRY NOT TO GET STUCK
IN THE THING. [laughs]

07:09.796 --> 07:11.131
- HEY.
- HI, HI.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.033
- YOU MUST BE--
- PENELOPE.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.034
- PENELOPE, HEY.
- HI, RYAN.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.468
- ARE YOU RYAN?
- YEAH.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.303
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU'RE TALLER THAN I EXPECTED.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.805
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.940
YOU SOUND SHORT ON THE PHONE.
- AND YOU'RE SHORTER.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.942
- I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS EVER
SAID THAT TO ME BEFORE.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.078
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.846
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. DID YOU
FIND THE PLACE OKAY?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.815
- YEAH. THEY DROPPED US OFF ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STREET.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.116
- OH.
- OTHER THAN THAT, WE'RE OKAY.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.685
IT'S COLD.
I DIDN'T BRING MY GLOVES.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.620
I DIDN'T BRING MY UMBRELLA.
- YEAH.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.921
WELL, THAT'S NEW YORK
FOR YOU.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.090
FIRST IMPRESSIONS...EH.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.459
THEY'RE A LITTLE ROUGH
AROUND THE EDGES.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.927
- SO WE ARE IN THE UPPER
EAST SIDE NOW, RIGHT?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.196
- WELL, NO, WE'RE KIND OF
MIDTOWN EAST,

07:43.229 --> 07:44.931
WHICH ISN'T
EXACTLY UPPER EAST.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.067
THIS IS TRUMP WORLD TOWER.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.069
IT'S GOT EVERY AMENITY
IMAGINABLE

07:49.069 --> 07:50.603
AND IT HAS HUGE VIEWS,
BECAUSE BASICALLY,

07:50.637 --> 07:51.604
THE EAST RIVER
IS RIGHT THERE.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.839
- OKAY.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.374
- NICK IS VERY STRICT
WITH HIS REQUIREMENTS.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.775
HE'S MAKING THAT
VERY CLEAR TO ME.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.610
HE WANTS A FULL-SERVICE
BUILDING WITH AMENITIES.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.379
HE WANTS VIEWS,
HE WANTS OUTDOOR SPACE,

07:59.412 --> 08:02.015
AND HE WANTS SOMETHING
NEW AND MODERN.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.550
- YEAH, LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
- YOU WANT TO SEE THE APARTMENT?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.251
- YEP.
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.253
- NICK BUYS AND SELLS
COMPANIES,

08:07.287 --> 08:10.757
AND PENELOPE
IS BASICALLY A PRINCESS.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.058
- RYAN.
- HEY, DEBRA, RYAN.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.526
HOW ARE YOU?
- WELCOME.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.610
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
RIGHT--COME STAND RIGHT HERE.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.112
THAT'S THE BEST PART.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.613
THE VIEW RIGHT HERE,
I LOVE THAT.

08:33.646 --> 08:35.615
AND THE BRIDGE
WITH THE ROOFTOP.

08:35.648 --> 08:36.950
- VERY NEW YORK,
NEW YORK VIEW.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.752
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL. OH,
THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.120
- ACTUALLY, WHAT'S BOTHERING ME
ABOUT THE FLOOR,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.521
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

08:41.554 --> 08:42.922
IS IF--IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD
THAT WE HAVE THE RUGS,

08:42.956 --> 08:47.594
BUT IT'S STARTING
TO MAKE ME DIZZY...

08:47.627 --> 08:49.095
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE ZIG-ZAGGING.

08:49.129 --> 08:53.500
- REALLY?
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE A PUZZLE.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.068
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.872
- THREE HUGE CLOSETS,
INCLUDING A WALK-IN.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.307
- OH, THAT'S NICE.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT'S DEEP.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.542
- THIS IS NOT DEEP.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.877
- SHE NEEDS THE THIRD BEDROOM.
THIRD BEDROOM.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.479
- WELL, THEN YOU NEED
ANOTHER--ANOTHER APARTMENT.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.082
- HOW DOES THIS SUITE
FEEL TO YOU?

09:09.115 --> 09:10.150
HOW DOES THE ROOM FEEL
TO YOU?

09:10.183 --> 09:13.019
- I LOVE THAT. LOVE IT.
- I THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:13.019 --> 09:15.121
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
IF IT WAS EMPTY.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.257
MAYBE I CAN ENVISION IT
MY WAY.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.025
LIKE, THE WAY I SEE IT NOW,

09:19.025 --> 09:21.661
IT'S LIKE IT WAS MY
GRANDMOTHER'S PLACE.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.663
- THE BONES OF THE APARTMENT
ARE WHAT'S IMPORTANT,

09:23.697 --> 09:26.232
NOT THE OLD LADY FURNITURE,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.268
AND AS A BUYER,
YOU'VE GOT TO COME IN

09:28.301 --> 09:30.070
AND HAVE AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT
OF IMAGINATION,

09:30.103 --> 09:34.140
AND I DON'T KNOW IF NICK
REALLY HAS THAT.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.811
- WINDOWS ARE GOOD,
VIEWS ARE GOOD.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.079
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.513
- NOW, THIS IS A SIGNATURE
TRUMP BUILDING.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.648
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND BETTER.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.451
- I'M NOT KNOCKING
THE BUILDING.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.952
I JUST--BEFORE I MAKE
A DECISION,...

09:46.052 --> 09:48.088
I'M A VERY PICKY PERSON,

09:48.121 --> 09:49.956
SO I WANT TO SEE
WHAT'S OUT THERE FIRST.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.325
- OKAY, IT'S THE FIRST ONE
WE'VE SEEN,

09:52.359 --> 09:53.326
SO WE HAVE A LOT
TO THINK ABOUT.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.061
REMEMBER THAT THE VALUE HERE
IS GOOD,

09:55.061 --> 09:56.930
ESPECIALLY FOR ALL THE STUFF
THAT'S IN THE BUILDING, RIGHT?

09:56.963 --> 09:58.064
SO, MENTAL NOTE.
MENTAL NOTE.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.299
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.300
- ALL I WOULD SAY IS
REMEMBER THE VIEW,

10:00.333 --> 10:01.935
VIEW, SPACE, FLOW.

10:01.968 --> 10:06.506
BASED ON NICK'S EXTENSIVE LIST
OF HOW MUCH HE HATES THIS PLACE,

10:06.539 --> 10:09.275
I'M GONNA GUESS
HE'S NOT GONNA BUY IT.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.811
- I MEAN, LIKE I SAID,
I'M PICKY.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.814
[mellow music]

10:14.848 --> 10:21.788
* *

10:21.821 --> 10:22.989
- TODAY I GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM ZACH,

10:23.023 --> 10:25.291
AND HE WANTS TO SEE ME
IN HIS OFFICE,

10:25.325 --> 10:26.793
SO WE'LL SEE.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.795
HEY, ZACH.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:28.828 --> 10:31.965
- I'M OKAY.
GOT A CALL FROM MICHAEL.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.633
- MICHAEL?

10:33.667 --> 10:37.070
- HE SAID HE'S NOT ON
THE PROJECT ANYMORE.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.872
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:38.905 --> 10:41.307
- I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
IT WAS REALLY WEIRD.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.743
HE WAS KIND OF, LIKE,
SENSITIVE AND EMOTIONAL

10:43.777 --> 10:45.712
AND I DON'T KNOW.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.147
SORRY, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO EAT LUNCH TODAY.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.182
- I REALLY ACTUALLY
DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.085
THE PROJECT'S BEEN ON
THE MARKET FOR A MONTH.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.587
I'M CONCERNED ONLY
WITH IT SELLING.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.022
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA SEE
THE RESULTS FROM THE PARTY.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.858
WE HAD 170-SOMETHING
BROKERS THERE.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.093
- FROM THE PARTY,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE LINED UP

11:00.126 --> 11:01.194
IN THE NEXT WEEK?

11:01.227 --> 11:03.063
- WELL, I HAVE THIS BUYER
FROM HONG KONG,

11:03.096 --> 11:05.065
AND THEY'RE COMING IN;
THAT COULD BE SOMETHING.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.967
- ALL RIGHT, FREDRIK, THE CARRY
COST ON THIS PROJECT IS HUGE.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.770
LIKE, EVERY MONTH THAT I'M
SITTING AROUND WITH INVENTORY,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.472
IT COSTS A TON OF MONEY.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.075
LIKE, YOU NEED TO
GET THIS SOLD.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.944
I'M SERIOUS, OKAY?

11:17.977 --> 11:20.780
- I DON'T WANT TO UPSET
MY MOST IMPORTANT CLIENT.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.781
THE PRESSURE IS ON.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.784
I HAVE TO SELL OUT
949 PARK.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.086
I GET THE POINT.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.422
I, UM, I'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS I HAVE AN OFFER.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.360
- COMING UP...

11:33.393 --> 11:34.994
- THEY PUT 2 MILLION
INTO THIS, WHERE?

11:35.095 --> 11:35.995
- $2 MILLION.
- WHERE DID THEY PUT TWO?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.230
WHERE? I DON'T GET IT.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.499
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.434
WHERE DID SHE COME FROM?

11:45.772 --> 11:48.742
[upbeat music]

11:48.775 --> 11:51.111
* *

11:51.111 --> 11:52.645
- LET'S GO TO--WE'RE
GONNA GO TO 111TH AVENUE.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.147
- YOU GOT IT, MIKE.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.682
- NEW LISTING TODAY,
I HOPE.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.317
- VERY GOOD.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.019
- MY LISTING WITH FREDRIK
DID NOT GO WELL.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.120
IT WAS A DISASTER.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.588
I JUST CAN'T WORK WITH HIM.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.356
BUT I'M STAYING POSITIVE.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.091
I'M ON MY WAY NOW
TO GET A NEW LISTING

12:05.125 --> 12:07.560
AND HOPEFULLY JUST MOVE ON TO
BETTER AND BIGGER THINGS.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.062
YOU CAN SEE THE HIGH LINE
AND EVERYTHING.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.563
IT'LL BE A LITTLE,
UH, DAY TRIP.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.732
CHELSEA
IS IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN,

12:12.766 --> 12:14.367
ALL THE WAY PUSHED AGAINST
THE HUDSON RIVER

12:14.401 --> 12:15.535
ON THE WEST SIDE.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.438
20 YEARS AGO, CHELSEA WAS
A DANGEROUS PLACE TO LIVE.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.874
TODAY, CHELSEA IS KNOWN TO
HAVE THE COOLEST, NEWEST,

12:20.907 --> 12:22.942
AND MOST FAMOUS BUILDINGS
IN MANHATTAN.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.111
NOW YOU CAN BUY
A $22 MILLION APARTMENT THERE.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.615
20 YEARS AGO, $22 MILLION,
YOU COULD HAVE HAD CHELSEA.

12:33.586 --> 12:38.124
111TH AVENUE WAS DESIGNED
BY THE FAMOUS JEAN NOUVEL.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.559
HE'S WHAT WE CALL NOW
A STARCHITECT.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.428
HE'S A STAR ARCHITECT.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.563
HIS BUILDINGS HAVE A FOLLOWING
LIKE NONE OTHER.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.597
THANK YOU.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.332
I MEAN, IT TAKES
A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS

12:46.366 --> 12:47.634
TO GET INTO A PROJECT
LIKE THIS.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.902
THEY ALREADY HAVE
AN ON-SITE SALES TEAM,

12:48.935 --> 12:51.738
SO I REALLY NEED TO PROVE
MY WORTH.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.139
- HI.
- HELLO.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.276
- HOW ARE YOU?
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.778
I'M SO EXCITED
TO SHOW YOU THIS BUILDING.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.146
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.781
- I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.433
THE WINDOWS ARE REALLY CRAZY.
- YEAH.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.069
EVERY WINDOW IS DIFFERENT.
THEY'RE ALUMINUM AND STEEL.

13:23.103 --> 13:29.476
THERE'S 1,700 PANES OF GLASS
THAT ARE HUNG ON THE BUILDING,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.878
AND THE THING THAT MAKES IT
SO AMAZING

13:31.911 --> 13:35.749
IS THAT ALL OF THESE WINDOWS
ARE FRAMED, SO, LIKE, THAT

13:35.782 --> 13:40.754
IS THIS PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL FRAME
OF MANHATTAN, RIGHT?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.756
BECAUSE EVERY UNIT,

13:42.789 --> 13:44.724
THESE WINDOWS ARE
IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS,

13:44.758 --> 13:49.329
EVERY UNIT REALLY IS
ITS OWN WORK OF ART.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.632
- SO, LIKE, THIS UNIT--SO
YOU'VE GOT 1,700 SQUARE FEET.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.633
WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN ASKING FOR?

13:53.667 --> 13:54.834
LIKE $3, $4 MILLION?

13:54.868 --> 13:58.638
- UM, THIS ONE IS 3.5.
- OKAY.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.774
SO YOU HAVE 12 UNITS LEFT
OUT OF THE--

14:00.807 --> 14:02.275
- 54.
- 54.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.678
WITH REAL ESTATE IN NEW YORK,
A LOT OF TIMES,

14:04.711 --> 14:06.446
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW--
IT'S WHO YOU KNOW.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.281
I'M THE LUCKIEST BROKER 'CAUSE
I HAVE THE GREATEST RESOURCE--

14:08.314 --> 14:09.683
MY FATHER.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.518
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, WHAT YOU
GUYS HAVE WITH THE DEVELOPER,

14:11.551 --> 14:14.688
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY
LIKE TO GET INVOLVED HERE

14:14.721 --> 14:19.292
IF I CAN MAYBE TAKE A LISTING
AND PLAY AROUND WITH IT.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.394
I COULD START BRINGING
SOME PEOPLE FROM UPTOWN

14:21.428 --> 14:23.530
AND OUT OF TOWN HERE.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.733
- I THINK WE CAN.
YOUR ROLODEX WOULD BE GREAT.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.201
- OKAY, COOL.
- IT'S A GOOD MATCH.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.071
- BUT I'D LIKE TO, YOU KNOW,
YOUR AGREEMENTS HERE,

14:31.071 --> 14:32.439
I MEAN, WE CAN FIGURE OUT

14:32.472 --> 14:36.443
HOW THE ACTUAL COMMISSION
STRUCTURE WOULD WORK.

14:36.476 --> 14:40.547
- IF YOU BRING US A GOOD BUYER
WHO'S GONNA CLOSE QUICKLY--

14:40.580 --> 14:41.715
- A QUALIFIED CASH BUYER.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.117
- AND A GOOD--
A GOOD ASKING PRICE,

14:44.150 --> 14:46.319
WE'LL GIVE YOU THE 4%.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.887
AND IF YOU DON'T,
UNFORTUNATELY,

14:47.921 --> 14:49.089
THOSE ARE THE HARD TIMES
IN REAL ESTATE.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.391
YOU GET NOTHING.
- RIGHT.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.727
DEALS LIKE THIS
ARE A BIG GAMBLE.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.830
HAVING A CO-BROKE,
IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED PAYOFF.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.232
I'M SPENDING MY MONEY
FIXING UP THE APARTMENT,

14:59.265 --> 15:02.302
THROWING PARTIES
AND OPEN HOUSES AND ADVERTISING,

15:02.335 --> 15:05.071
AND SHE JUST SITS BACK AND
MAYBE WILL SELL IT HERSELF

15:05.105 --> 15:07.874
FROM THE BUZZ WE'RE GETTING
ABOUT THE MONEY I'M SPENDING,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.376
AND I GET NOTHING.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.177
BUT THIS IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT BUILDING.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.780
I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
FAMOUS ARCHITECTS IN THE WORLD.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.682
I REALLY WANT THIS.

15:15.715 --> 15:20.553
OKAY. I'M HAPPY TO, UH,
BE A PART OF THIS.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.289
- EXCELLENT. WE'RE EXCITED
TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.557
- I'VE NEVER SIGNED
WITH A RED MARKER.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.559
IT'S LIKE SIGNING IN BLOOD HERE.
- [laughs]

15:28.128 --> 15:31.097
[upbeat music]

15:31.131 --> 15:36.703
* *

15:36.736 --> 15:38.104
- TODAY IS THE DAY.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.474
I HAVE A PRIVATE SHOWING
FOR 949 PARK.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.543
I'M UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.479
ZACH, THE DEVELOPER, REALLY
WANTS ME TO SELL.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.647
OH, HI.
- HI.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.482
- I'M FREDRIK EKLUND.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.650
THE BUYERS ARE A COUPLE

15:50.684 --> 15:52.652
WITH MULTIPLE HOMES
AROUND THE WORLD--

15:52.686 --> 15:53.953
HONG KONG, PARIS,

15:53.987 --> 15:56.556
AND I GUESS NOW THEY NEED
A PLACE IN NEW YORK.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.159
2,000 SQUARE FEET DUPLEX.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.594
BEAUTIFUL FLOORING,
BEAUTIFUL BUILT-INS.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.229
AND LOOK AT
THE CEILING HEIGHTS.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.231
YOU HAVE SPEAKERS
EVERYWHERE.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.399
- IT IS PRETTY AMAZING.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.600
- SO LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND,
GUYS.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.569
YOU GUYS COOK A LOT?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.542
YEAH, THIS IS
A REAL NICE KITCHEN.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.578
EVERYTHING IS CUSTOM.
REALLY BEAUTIFUL FROM ITALY.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.247
AND THEN HERE, VERY CLEVER.
LOTS AND LOTS OF STORAGE.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.616
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS
APARTMENT HAS FOUR EXPOSURES.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.251
- I NOTICED IT HAD
A BIG BALCONY HERE,

16:25.285 --> 16:26.453
WHICH IS KIND OF UNUSUAL.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.854
- FOR PARK AVENUE,
THAT'S UNHEARD OF.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.856
IT FEELS LIKE A REAL HOUSE,
RIGHT?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.291
- YES.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.093
- AND YOU HAVE
TWO MASTER SUITES UP HERE--

16:33.126 --> 16:35.362
ONE SMALLER TO THIS SIDE,

16:35.395 --> 16:38.398
AND THEN THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL
MASTER ON THIS SIDE,

16:38.431 --> 16:40.133
FACING PARK.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.135
AND WHAT'S SO AMAZING
ABOUT THIS APARTMENT

16:42.168 --> 16:43.803
IS THE
FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.205
IF YOU LOOK
ACROSS THE STREET,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.240
ON MOST BUILDINGS
ON PARK AVENUE,

16:47.273 --> 16:48.875
YOU HAVE THESE TINY
LITTLE WINDOWS.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.077
- BUT, YOU KNOW, TELL ME,
CAN, UH, YOU KNOW,

16:51.111 --> 16:52.579
THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET,
UH--

16:52.612 --> 16:53.880
- YEAH?
- YOU KNOW, SEE IN?

16:53.913 --> 16:56.149
- CAN THEY SEE US?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.484
- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
WITH THE DEVELOPER.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.485
SORRY, LOVE.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.754
AND WE INSTALLED THESE.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.155
SO I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO
FOR YOU, TOO,

17:02.188 --> 17:04.057
IF YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT THAT ISSUE,

17:04.090 --> 17:07.494
YOU CAN PUT--AND I'LL MAKE
THE DEVELOPER PAY FOR THAT,

17:07.527 --> 17:12.699
THE REAL BLACKOUT SHADES.

17:12.732 --> 17:16.036
I WAS SURPRISED BY THEIR CONCERN
WITH THE LARGE WINDOWS.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.572
WHAT MAKES 949 PARK SO UNIQUE
FOR PARK AVENUE

17:19.606 --> 17:21.274
IS FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.710
IF YOU WANT SMALL,
TINY WINDOWS IN A CO-OP,

17:23.743 --> 17:25.045
THERE'S LOTS OF THOSE.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.546
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
SO FAR?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.248
- LOVELY.
- IT'S A LOVELY APARTMENT.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.549
IT'S VERY WELL CONCEIVED.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.785
- SO WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING
BACK TO HONG KONG?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.953
- WE'RE LEAVING TOMORROW.
- TOMORROW? WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.556
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
TONIGHT, THEN.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.091
- KIND OF.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.259
- THAT'S WHAT--
THAT'S WHAT EVENING

17:39.292 --> 17:40.593
IN THE RESTAURANTS
IN NEW YORK ARE FOR.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.596
- NO, BUT CAN I COME WITH
AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE--?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.065
- WHY DON'T WE CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING?

17:45.098 --> 17:48.101
- I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOUR CALL
AROUND 6:30, 7:00, THEN.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.736
- [laughs]
- RIGHT?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.237
THE SHOWING DEFINITELY
WENT WELL.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.607
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WINDOWS
AND PEOPLE LOOKING IN,

17:54.641 --> 17:57.744
BUT I HAVE A REALLY GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS SHOWING.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.812
NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.879
- YEAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR TAKING THE TIME.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.581
- OF COURSE.
IT'S MY JOB.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.919
[upbeat music]

18:06.019 --> 18:07.520
* *

18:10.023 --> 18:11.658
- NOW, ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE
APARTMENTS AS DIFFERENT GIRLS

18:11.691 --> 18:13.426
OR JUST AS DIFFERENT DATES
WITH THE SAME GIRL?

18:13.460 --> 18:14.694
- NO, THIS IS
A DIFFERENT GIRL.

18:14.728 --> 18:15.829
- OKAY,
IT'S A DIFFERENT GIRL.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.497
- YEAH, WHY WOULD I
HAVE THE SAME--?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.099
I MEAN, I DIDN'T LIKE
THE FIRST GIRL.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.100
- OKAY.
- WHY WOULD I GO OUT WITH HER?

18:20.133 --> 18:21.601
- YEAH, NO, SCREW HER.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.670
AS A GOOD BROKER,
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO TALK,

18:23.703 --> 18:24.871
AND YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
WHEN TO SHUT UP.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.240
WITH THIS COUPLE, I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE TO LISTEN,

18:27.273 --> 18:28.675
AND THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA
GET THE DEAL DONE.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.943
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.846
LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK
AT THE SECOND GIRL.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.280
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M STEVE HALPERN.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.281
- RYAN.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.449
WELCOME TO 19-BC.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.451
STEVE HALPERN.
NICE TO MEET YOU, WELCOME.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.686
- HI, STEVE,
HOW ARE YOU DOING? NICK.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.687
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- A PLEASURE.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.688
- WELCOME.
PLEASE COME ON IN.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.722
- WOW.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.926
- I'M REALLY HOPING NICK WILL
LIKE THE SECOND APARTMENT

18:46.960 --> 18:48.395
MORE THAN THE FIRST.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.597
IT'S IN A BEAUTIFUL LOCATION
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.132
RIGHT BY CENTRAL PARK.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.134
IT BREATHES, I MEAN, THIS
APARTMENT BREATHES A LOT MORE

18:54.167 --> 18:55.568
THAN THE ONE WE JUST SAW.
- IT'S VERY SPACIOUS.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.703
I MEAN,
COMPARED TO THE LAST ONE.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.272
THE LAST ONE
WAS VERY OLD FASHIONED,

18:59.305 --> 19:01.107
WHEREAS THIS IS MORE MODERN,
MORE YOUTHFUL.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.909
I LOVE THE VIEWS.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.544
I THINK I'M VERY HAPPY,
ACTUALLY, WITH THE VIEWS.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.546
I NEVER THOUGHT IT'D BE
SO EXPANSIVE.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.516
- UH, THEY PAID 2.4 FOR IT,

19:09.549 --> 19:11.851
AND THEY PUT ABOUT $2 MILLION
WORTH OF WORK INTO IT.

19:11.885 --> 19:15.488
- THEY PUT $2 MIL--WHAT?
HOLD.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.090
THEY PUT $2 MILLION INTO THIS?
WHERE?

19:17.123 --> 19:19.059
WHERE DID THEY PUT 2?
WHERE? I DON'T GET IT.

19:20.694 --> 19:23.730
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.665
WHERE DID SHE COME FROM?

19:25.699 --> 19:29.502
- OKAY, WELL, WE CAN START
WITH REMOVING WALLS.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.404
- OH, MY GOD.
$2 MILLION?

19:31.438 --> 19:33.873
- NEW FLOORS.
- THAT'S NUTS. I MEAN, COME ON.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.850
- SO YOU HAVE A HUGE
MASTER BEDROOM.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.720
UH, EASILY FITS
A KING-SIZED BED.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.854
- OH, MY GOD.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.590
IN ORDER FOR ME TO MAKE THIS
FEEL LESS COMMON,

19:50.623 --> 19:53.626
I WOULD HAVE TO GO AND SPEND
ANOTHER $2 MILLION

19:53.660 --> 19:55.128
LIKE THEY DID.

19:56.930 --> 20:00.567
- MOST BUYERS WILL WAIT TILL
AFTER SEEING AN APARTMENT

20:00.600 --> 20:01.935
TO RIP IT TO SHREDS.

20:01.968 --> 20:06.573
NICK AND PENELOPE, NOT REALLY
PART OF THAT CATEGORY.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.975
- IF YOU TAKE ALL THAT DOWN,
THAT HEAVY [bleep] DOWN,

20:09.009 --> 20:11.745
THAT FLOW, IT'LL JUST CHANGE
THE WHOLE MOOD.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.981
THERE'S MODERN
AND THEN THERE'S MODERN.

20:15.015 --> 20:19.619
IT'S JUST THE WRONG MODERN.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.788
- COMING UP...
- THIS IS RUDE.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.657
YOU MADE ME COME TO
THE UPPER EAST SIDE FOR THAT?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.693
- I THINK YOU'RE AN ASS.

20:30.296 --> 20:33.266
[whimsical music]

20:33.299 --> 20:37.370
* *

20:37.404 --> 20:38.672
- I WILL NOT LIVE THERE.
I CANNOT DO IT.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.106
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
NO.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.875
- DO YOU REALIZE, THIS IS ALMOST
LIKE A HIGHWAY RIGHT HERE.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.109
- RIGHT.

20:43.143 --> 20:44.110
- SO YOU'RE LIVING
RIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY.

20:44.144 --> 20:45.245
DO YOU THINK THAT'S SMART?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.013
- YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

20:47.047 --> 20:48.415
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE COMING IN
FROM OUT OF TOWN

20:48.448 --> 20:49.683
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT APARTMENTS,
AND I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

20:49.716 --> 20:51.217
THAT I'M SHOWING YOU
THINGS THAT WORK.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.219
SO, BASED ON WHAT WE TALKED
ABOUT ON THE PHONE ORIGINALLY

20:53.253 --> 20:56.356
AND YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
YOU KNOW, FOR THE MOST PART,

20:56.389 --> 20:57.791
THAT APARTMENT FIT THEM,
RIGHT?

20:57.824 --> 20:58.892
- UH, SORT OF.
- MM-HMM.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.360
- YOU KNOW,
A KIND OF HIGH FLOOR,

21:00.393 --> 21:02.696
THREE BEDROOM, THREE BATH,
VIEW, FULL-SERVICE BUILDING.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.364
- YEAH,
THE BASICS WERE THERE.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.399
- SO IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
BUT EXACTLY WRONG.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.836
- YEAH, EXACTLY WRONG, AND LIKE
I SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, I--

21:09.869 --> 21:11.538
- I FEEL LIKE YOU WANT
A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

21:11.571 --> 21:13.073
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.507
- I DO KNOW WHAT I WANT.
- SHE'S ALWAYS CONFUSED.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.242
- I'M A DOWNTOWN GIRL,
BUT I HAVE UPTOWN TASTES.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.877
HE'S THE ONE
THAT NEEDS WATER.

21:17.911 --> 21:19.646
I DON'T NEED WATER
BECAUSE OF THE FACT

21:19.679 --> 21:20.880
THAT WHEN WE GO TO GREECE

21:20.914 --> 21:22.549
AND WE HAVE OUR BEAUTIFUL
VILLA IN CRETE,

21:22.582 --> 21:23.683
I SEE WATER EVERYWHERE.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.085
WE'RE DEAD ON THE SEA.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.353
WHAT THE HELL?

21:26.386 --> 21:28.088
YOU CAN'T COMPARE
THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA,

21:28.088 --> 21:30.090
YOU KNOW, AND THE AEGEAN--
- TO THE HUDSON?

21:30.090 --> 21:31.424
- TO THE HUDSON.
- WHAT'S THIS, THE EAST RIVER?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.425
- THAT'S THE EAST RIVER,
YEAH.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.194
- BUT I CAN PINPOINT
WHAT I NEED,

21:34.227 --> 21:36.429
BUT YOU KEEP CHANGING
YOUR OPINION.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.598
LIKE, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.400
- WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED, YOU HAVE
TO COMPROMISE ON EVERYTHING.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.568
- ARE YOU COMPROMISING
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH?

21:41.601 --> 21:42.902
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

21:42.936 --> 21:44.404
- WELL, I HAVE TO COMPROMISE
WHAT I WANT TO SUIT HIM.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.573
- ALL RIGHT, SO I THINK--
OKAY, WAIT.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.241
I HAVE--I FEEL LIKE THERE'S,
LIKE, A LOT OF THOUGHTS

21:48.274 --> 21:49.909
GOING THROUGH MY HEAD RIGHT NOW,
BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT.

21:49.943 --> 21:51.544
- I KNOW WHAT I WANT.
- I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WANTS.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.013
I MEAN,
THIS COULD TAKE YEARS.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.181
I MEAN, THERE'S MILLIONS
OF APARTMENTS FOR SALE.

21:55.215 --> 21:57.183
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S--
IF IT'S 'CAUSE

21:57.217 --> 21:58.885
THEY'RE JUST
DIFFICULT BY NATURE

21:58.918 --> 22:00.387
OR IF THEY'RE HAVING,
LIKE, MARITAL PROBLEMS.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.122
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT
HAVING SEX ANYMORE OR WHATNOT,

22:02.155 --> 22:04.090
BUT THIS IS JUST
GOING TO BE A PROCESS.

22:04.124 --> 22:05.125
LET'S DO THIS.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.193
LET ME DROP YOU BACK OFF
AT YOUR HOTEL.

22:07.227 --> 22:08.395
YOU GUYS HAVE PLANS TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

22:08.428 --> 22:09.696
- YEAH, YEAH.
- YEAH?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.331
- WE'LL BE READY FOR TOMORROW,
TRUST ME.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.365
- OKAY.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.403
[upbeat music]

22:16.436 --> 22:24.411
* *

22:24.444 --> 22:27.514
- OH! HOW YOU BEEN?
- HOW ARE YOU?

22:27.547 --> 22:29.482
- I'M GOOD. YOU GONNA
PUMP IT UP TONIGHT?

22:29.516 --> 22:31.751
- I'LL PUMP IT UP TONIGHT.
- OKAY.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.154
SO YOU HAVE SOME MUSIC?
IT'S ALL SET UP?

22:34.187 --> 22:36.556
THERE'S NO ELECTRICAL ISSUES?
- NO.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.924
- I WANT A COOL VIBE

22:37.957 --> 22:40.093
THAT MAKES PEOPLE WANT TO SPEND
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.729
THIS IS DOWNTOWN.
THIS IS NEW, THIS IS HIP.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.098
AFTER THE BROKER'S OPEN
FOR 949 PARK,

22:45.131 --> 22:47.200
THIS BROKER'S OPEN
IS HUGE FOR ME.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.435
HOW'S IT GOING IN HERE?
WE'RE LOOKING GOOD?

22:48.468 --> 22:49.436
- YEAH.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.204
- I'VE GONE TO
GREAT LENGTHS.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.406
I'VE GOT A FULL BAR,
AMAZING CATERING,

22:53.440 --> 22:58.011
A GREAT DJ, AND SOME OF THE
CITY'S HIPPEST ENTERTAINERS.

22:58.111 --> 23:00.246
* *

23:00.280 --> 23:02.248
OH, LOOKING GOOD.

23:02.282 --> 23:04.451
THE LESSON I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT OPEN HOUSES

23:04.484 --> 23:06.853
IS THAT BROKERS GO TO HUNDREDS
OF THESE EVENTS A MONTH.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.121
YOU SEE A UNIT.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.889
THERE'S CHEESE AND CRACKERS.
THAT'S IT.

23:09.923 --> 23:11.191
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.193
THEY'RE GONNA REMEMBER THIS
EVENT AND THIS APARTMENT.

23:13.226 --> 23:18.198
* *

23:18.231 --> 23:20.467
HI, HOW DO YOU DO?
MICHAEL LORBER.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.702
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
SOME BEAUTIFUL HOMES

23:22.736 --> 23:23.837
A FEW FLOORS DOWN BELOW.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.072
COME ON IN.
YOU GUYS LOOK VERY SHARP.

23:26.106 --> 23:28.708
[camera shutter clicks]

23:28.742 --> 23:30.543
I HAVE ONE ON THE EIGHTH FLOOR
WHICH IS SPECTACULAR.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.713
IT FACES SOUTH, SO YOU LOOK OVER
AT THE FRANK GEHRY BUILDING.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.715
- MICHAEL, THIS IS UNREAL.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.350
- THE TWO BEDROOMS,
VIEWS RIGHT ON THE RIVER,

23:37.384 --> 23:38.818
OVERLOOKING CHELSEA PIERS.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.221
EVERYTHING IS GOING PERFECT.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.989
THE PARTY'S
RAGING UPSTAIRS,

23:43.089 --> 23:44.357
AND THERE'S A LOT OF
INTEREST

23:44.391 --> 23:45.358
IN THE UNIT DOWNSTAIRS.

23:45.392 --> 23:49.095
THIS IS
AN AMAZING TWO BEDROOM.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.499
YOU WALK IN, YOU'LL SEE
THE FRANK GEHRY BUILDING.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.767
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE SUNSET.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.335
- WOW, IT'S SPECTACULAR.

23:55.368 --> 23:56.936
- SINCE I'M EXPECTING
SO MANY PEOPLE,

23:56.970 --> 23:58.705
I'VE DECIDED TO SET UP
IN THE PENTHOUSE

23:58.738 --> 24:02.042
AND THEN SEND BROKERS DOWN TO
SEE MY UNIT IN SMALLER GROUPS.

24:02.075 --> 24:03.510
THE FAUCETS,
EVERYTHING'S DIGITAL HERE,

24:03.543 --> 24:06.546
SO YOU HAVE TO HIT
FOR THAT FOR THE WATER.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.314
- WHAT ARE THESE,
THESE SQUARE THINGS?

24:08.348 --> 24:11.351
- THOSE ARE THE SCONCES.
- REALLY? OH.

24:11.384 --> 24:12.352
- THEY'RE JEAN NOUVEL
DESIGNED SCONCES.

24:12.385 --> 24:13.720
- WOW.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.322
- JEAN NOUVEL PLACES
EACH WINDOW IN A SPECIFIC AREA

24:16.356 --> 24:17.624
SO YOU GET A DIFFERENT VIEW.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.193
- WOW.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.461
- IT'S UP TO YOU.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.363
- JANE, LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THE MOON.

24:23.396 --> 24:27.334
IMAGINE IF WE WERE
IN THIS BED.

24:27.367 --> 24:28.868
- [laughs]

24:28.902 --> 24:30.470
UM, AWKWARD.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.473
[upbeat music]

24:33.506 --> 24:34.674
* *

24:34.708 --> 24:37.210
CALL ME AND I WILL SHOW IT.
- [laughs]

24:37.243 --> 24:39.212
- I WANT TO GET YOUR CARD.
- OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.413
THE PARTY WAS ROCKING.

24:40.447 --> 24:43.249
THERE WAS A LOT OF BROKERS,
IT WAS A GREAT ATMOSPHERE,

24:43.283 --> 24:45.085
AND EVERYONE SEEMED
TO BE HAVING FUN.

24:45.085 --> 24:46.753
AND FOR EVERY NICKEL
I PISSED AWAY HERE,

24:46.786 --> 24:48.254
IT'S GONNA COME BACK
DRESSED AS A DIME.

24:48.288 --> 24:50.090
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

24:50.090 --> 24:51.091
BYE.
- YEAH.

24:56.096 --> 25:02.168
[whimsical music]

25:02.202 --> 25:03.837
BUT IT'S WORTH WAITING

25:03.870 --> 25:06.473
BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S COMING
WITH AN OFFER.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.775
A FEW DAYS HAS PASSED SINCE
LAWRENCE AND HIS WIFE

25:08.808 --> 25:10.110
VISITED 949 PARK.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.178
I'M FREDRIK EKLUND.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

25:12.212 --> 25:13.713
- I NOTICED IT HAD
A BIG BALCONY HERE,

25:13.747 --> 25:15.048
WHICH IS KIND OF UNUSUAL.

25:15.048 --> 25:16.383
- FOR PARK AVENUE,
THAT'S UNHEARD OF.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.451
THEY'VE GONE BACK TO PARIS,

25:18.485 --> 25:20.286
AND I GOT A CALL
FROM THEIR BROKER.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.123
SHE WANTS TO MEET, WHICH
MUST MEAN A LOT OF GOOD NEWS.

25:23.156 --> 25:24.557
- I'M GIOIA.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.326
I'M FREDRIK. HAVE YOU
BEEN TO THE BUILDING BEFORE?

25:26.359 --> 25:29.062
- I WAS AT YOUR PARTY.
- MY PAR--OH, MY.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.064
MY MEXICAN FIESTA.
I'M SO GLAD.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.365
SO YOU'VE BEEN HERE.
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

25:32.399 --> 25:33.366
- YEAH.
- LET'S SIT DOWN.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.068
- SURE.

25:35.101 --> 25:38.304
- SO I'M HOPING YOU HAVE
AN OFFER FOR ME.

25:38.338 --> 25:39.739
- I DO.

25:39.773 --> 25:42.242
- TO GET THE MOMENTUM GOING,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

25:42.275 --> 25:45.178
TO SELL THE VERY FIRST APARTMENT
IN A NEW DEVELOPMENT.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.214
- THE OFFER IS CASH
FOR $3.2 MILLION.

25:48.248 --> 25:51.384
- 3.2?
- YES.

25:51.418 --> 25:54.087
- AS IN $800,000
BELOW ASK?

25:54.087 --> 25:56.356
- BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE ASK IS ON ANYTHING.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.324
- YOU KNOW
THAT'S A RIDICULOUS NUMBER.

25:58.358 --> 26:00.427
- NO. I'M NOT SO SURE
I KNOW THAT.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.530
- PARK AVENUE, NEW CONSTRUCTION,
ALL THIS GLASS?

26:03.563 --> 26:06.099
IT'S PERFECT.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.534
- HOW MANY APARTMENTS
HAVE YOU SOLD

26:07.567 --> 26:11.338
IN THIS WONDERFUL,
PERFECT BUILDING OF YOURS?

26:11.371 --> 26:13.306
YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO STEP UP TO THE BAT

26:13.340 --> 26:14.774
AND GET THE WHEELS ROLLING.

26:14.808 --> 26:17.811
- THAT'S, LIKE,
20% BELOW ASK.

26:17.844 --> 26:21.047
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THE OFFER.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.717
- THIS IS RUDE.
- IS IT?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.653
- YOU MADE ME COME
TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE FOR 3.2?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.054
WHY DIDN'T YOU EMAIL IT
TO ME?

26:28.088 --> 26:29.889
'CAUSE THEN I COULD HAVE, LIKE,
DELETED THE EMAIL.

26:29.923 --> 26:32.225
OKAY, I'M GETTING
SCREAMED AT BY MY CLIENT,

26:32.258 --> 26:34.361
BUT, YOU KNOW, BY LAW,
I HAVE TO PRESENT ALL...

26:34.394 --> 26:36.229
- EXACTLY.
- [bleep] OFFERS.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.064
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING
FOR ME.

26:38.064 --> 26:41.468
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THAT
PRESSURE FROM ZACH?

26:41.501 --> 26:42.736
BRRRRM.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.071
THIS IS THE WORST PART
ABOUT BEING A BROKER.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.173
HEY, ZACH. AI-YI-YI.

26:47.207 --> 26:48.842
YEAH, THEY CAME IN
WITH AN OFFER.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.410
IT'S ALL CASH.
THAT'S THE GOOD PART.

26:50.443 --> 26:55.715
THE BAD PART IS, UH, 3.2.

26:55.749 --> 26:57.550
OH, I KNOW IT'S TOO LOW.

26:57.584 --> 26:59.753
UH, WHAT IS THE LOWEST NUMBER
YOU'LL TAKE?

27:02.589 --> 27:06.693
3.8? OKAY. OKAY.

27:06.726 --> 27:10.930
LET ME--LET ME DO
WHAT I DO BEST. OKAY.

27:11.031 --> 27:18.171
OKAY, SO, UM, AS EXPECTED,
MY DEAR COLLEAGUE,

27:18.204 --> 27:23.510
UM, $3,200,000
IS A BIG NO.

27:26.680 --> 27:30.150
- UH-HUH. AND SO,
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

27:30.183 --> 27:31.151
- HE'S NOT EVEN
GONNA COUNTER IT,

27:31.184 --> 27:32.285
'CAUSE IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.355
I SUGGEST WE GO UPSTAIRS,
YOU CALL PARIS.

27:35.388 --> 27:36.723
YOU GOT TO BE CLOSER
TO ASK.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.159
- LET ME TALK TO THEM.
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM.

27:39.192 --> 27:41.461
- OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.
- OKAY.

27:41.494 --> 27:45.065
- THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION
INVOLVED, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:45.098 --> 27:47.534
I BELIEVE THEY WANT IT,
I BELIEVE THEY CAN AFFORD IT,

27:47.567 --> 27:50.203
AND I BELIEVE SHE'S TRYING
TO PULL A FAST ONE.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.073
[muttering]

27:54.341 --> 27:57.310
HMM. HMM, HMM,
HMM, HMM, HMM.

27:57.344 --> 28:01.147
[humming]

28:01.181 --> 28:03.116
[singing quietly]

28:04.718 --> 28:09.022
- SO...

28:09.055 --> 28:12.025
- YES?

28:12.058 --> 28:14.494
- SO...
- GOOD NEWS?

28:14.527 --> 28:18.164
- THEY'LL COME UP TO 3.6,
AND THAT'S A HUGE JUMP UP,

28:18.198 --> 28:20.800
AND I THINK IT'S A HELL
OF A GOOD OFFER, CASH.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.702
JUST ADMIT IT.

28:22.736 --> 28:26.172
- I'M NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING.
I'M SORRY.

28:26.206 --> 28:29.442
I RESPECT YOU.
I RESPECT YOUR BUSINESS.

28:29.476 --> 28:32.178
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.947
I'M MAKING GOOD PROGRESS HERE.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.182
SHE CAME UP FROM 3.2 TO 3.6,

28:36.216 --> 28:39.285
AND I GOT ZACH DOWN
FROM 3.975 TO 3.8.

28:39.319 --> 28:42.722
WHEE, WHEE.
NNN-YAH.

28:42.756 --> 28:44.524
- THEY SAID THEY'RE NOT
COMING UP ANY MORE,

28:44.557 --> 28:45.825
SO IT'S A TAKE IT
OR LEAVE IT SITUATION.

28:45.859 --> 28:47.060
- I THINK THEY'RE LYING.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.329
DO YOU REALLY MEAN
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

28:49.362 --> 28:51.398
THAT THEY WON'T COME UP
ANY MORE?

28:51.431 --> 28:53.066
'CAUSE I THINK I CAN
SEE THROUGH IT.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.735
- I THINK THIS IS JUST
A BUNCH OF B.S.

28:55.769 --> 28:58.071
I THINK YOUR GUY'S GETTING
A REALLY GOOD OFFER.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.372
- THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT REAL ESTATE

28:59.406 --> 29:02.175
IS THAT THE SELLER CAN ASK
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

29:02.208 --> 29:05.245
- GOOD-BYE, FREDRIK.
THIS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME.

29:05.278 --> 29:10.116
- I HAVE A FEELING...
SHE'S BLUFFING.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.094
- COMING UP...

29:21.127 --> 29:22.362
- I HATE THIS COLOR.

29:22.395 --> 29:23.496
- I THINK I'M GONNA FEEL
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

29:23.530 --> 29:24.831
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.700
- YOU NEED TO WORK
A LITTLE HARDER.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.910
- EW.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.745
I ALWAYS WAKE UP
AT THE CRACK OF DAWN,

29:38.778 --> 29:41.881
AND NOW I HAVE YET ANOTHER TASK
TO DO EVERY MORNING.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.654
I WAS GIVEN A SNAKE...

29:47.687 --> 29:49.789
- OH, MY GOD!
THAT'S A SNAKE!

29:49.823 --> 29:50.890
I DON'T LIKE THIS!

29:52.826 --> 29:54.828
- WHO DROPPED THIS OFF?
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

29:54.861 --> 29:55.929
- AND THEN I WENT
TO THE PET STORE

29:55.962 --> 29:56.930
AND THEY GAVE ME
FROZEN MICE,

29:56.963 --> 29:58.498
AND THERE WERE
NO DIRECTIONS.

30:01.401 --> 30:03.837
[sniffing]

30:03.870 --> 30:05.805
[groans]

30:05.839 --> 30:07.841
DID IT POP?

30:07.874 --> 30:12.312
OH! OH! OH!

30:12.345 --> 30:14.047
IT EXPLODED OUT THE BACK!

30:14.080 --> 30:15.048
OH!

30:15.081 --> 30:17.817
[coughs]

30:17.851 --> 30:19.986
OOH.

30:25.425 --> 30:31.498
ENJOY YOUR BREAKFAST.
I'M OFF TO WORK.

30:32.532 --> 30:35.168
[pensive music]

30:35.201 --> 30:36.436
- THEY SAID THEY'RE NOT
COMING UP ANY MORE.

30:36.469 --> 30:37.771
- I THINK THEY'RE LYING.

30:37.804 --> 30:40.840
- GOOD-BYE, FREDRIK.
THIS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME.

30:52.452 --> 30:54.154
HOWEVER...

30:54.187 --> 30:55.255
- YEAH?

30:55.288 --> 30:56.523
- MAYBE WE CAN
MAKE THIS WORK.

30:56.556 --> 30:57.691
- OH, REALLY?

30:57.724 --> 30:59.726
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

30:59.759 --> 31:02.962
WHAT DOES YOUR SELLER WANT?
WHERE WOULD HE SETTLE?

31:03.063 --> 31:09.336
- MEET ME AT 3.9
AND WE HAVE A DEAL.

31:09.369 --> 31:12.238
- WHY DON'T WE TRY TO MEET
AT 3.8?

31:12.272 --> 31:14.574
- [sighs]

31:15.775 --> 31:16.876
CHING-CHING.

31:16.910 --> 31:18.578
NO, 3.8 HE WON'T DO.

31:18.611 --> 31:20.280
YOU HAVE TO--YOU HAVE TO
GIVE ME SOME MORE.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.381
- UH-UH.

31:21.414 --> 31:22.816
- MAYBE, MAYBE, MAYBE
IN A PERFECT WORLD,

31:22.849 --> 31:26.086
HE'LL GO A LITTLE BIT LESS,
LIKE $3,850,000,

31:26.119 --> 31:29.155
YOU PAYING THE CLOSING COSTS.

31:29.189 --> 31:32.992
- I THINK YOU'RE AN ASS.
I REALLY DO.

31:33.093 --> 31:34.761
BUT I AM GONNA CALL THEM.

31:34.794 --> 31:36.096
- AN ASS?

31:36.129 --> 31:39.332
YOU COME INTO MY BUILDING,
OFFERING 20% BELOW ASK?

31:39.366 --> 31:41.101
I WORK ON A COMMISSION.

31:41.101 --> 31:42.969
EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR COUNTS,

31:43.003 --> 31:46.873
AND I WANT TO MAKE MY MOST
IMPORTANT CLIENT ECSTATIC.

31:52.479 --> 31:56.616
- ALL RIGHT, FREDRIK.
LET'S TALK.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.118
AND THIS IS THE END OF IT.

31:58.151 --> 32:01.321
- YES?

32:01.354 --> 32:03.123
- WE'RE GONNA
GO TO $3,830,000.

32:03.156 --> 32:04.691
WE DON'T WANT TO
MESS AROUND.

32:04.724 --> 32:07.193
IT'S A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
THEY'VE COME UP SO MUCH.

32:07.227 --> 32:12.065
- $3,830,000?

32:12.065 --> 32:13.633
- YES.

32:13.667 --> 32:17.470
- ONLY IF YOU TAKE BACK
THE "ASS" COMMENT.

32:17.504 --> 32:18.872
- YOU'RE NOT AN ASS.

32:18.905 --> 32:20.874
- OKAY, WE HAVE A DEAL.

32:20.907 --> 32:24.477
- BUT YOU ARE A JERK.
[laughs]

32:24.511 --> 32:27.714
- ZACH, WHO IS THE BEST
BROKER IN THE WORLD?

32:27.747 --> 32:28.948
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, WHO IS?

32:28.982 --> 32:31.618
IS THERE ANYONE BETTER?

32:31.651 --> 32:34.587
MICHAEL? MICHAEL?
MICHAEL?

32:34.621 --> 32:36.823
OH, NO. HE LEFT.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.170
- MY PARTY AT
THE CHELSEA BUILDING

32:50.203 --> 32:52.505
I THINK WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

32:52.539 --> 32:54.808
OUR BROKER'S COMING BY WITH ONE
OF HIS CLIENT'S REPS

32:54.841 --> 32:56.609
AND HOPES SOMETHING GREAT
COMES OUT OF IT.

32:56.643 --> 32:57.977
- MICHAEL?
- MM-HMM.

32:58.011 --> 32:59.679
- HI, I'M AARON.
- HI.

32:59.713 --> 33:02.482
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

33:02.515 --> 33:04.451
A PLEASURE.
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

33:04.484 --> 33:05.952
YEAH, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE BUILDING AT ALL?

33:06.052 --> 33:07.454
- NOT AT ALL, NO.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.122
- IT'S, UH, YOU KNOW, IT WAS
DESIGNED BY JEAN NOUVEL,

33:09.155 --> 33:12.058
WHO'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST
FAMOUS ARCHITECTS NOWADAYS.

33:12.092 --> 33:13.860
THIS BUILDING IS, YOU KNOW,
VERY UNIQUE.

33:13.893 --> 33:15.261
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
LIKE IT IN THE CITY

33:15.295 --> 33:16.596
AND MAYBE THE WORLD.

33:16.629 --> 33:19.399
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE,
I'M NOT A SLEAZY SALESMAN.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.267
THERE'S A WINE COOLER IN HERE
IN THIS ISLAND,

33:21.301 --> 33:22.969
YOU KNOW, THE SUB-ZERO.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.472
TOP OF THE LINE APPLIANCES
THROUGHOUT.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.207
FAST TALK IS CHEAP TALK.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.541
THESE ARE UNIQUE PROPERTIES,

33:28.575 --> 33:29.943
AND THESE ARE
SOPHISTICATED BUYERS.

33:29.976 --> 33:32.445
THEY CAN SPOT
A CHEAP SALESMAN A MILE AWAY.

33:32.479 --> 33:33.947
- SO THIS IS THE, UH,

33:33.980 --> 33:35.749
THE ONLY JEAN NOUVEL
BUILDING IN NEW YORK?

33:35.782 --> 33:38.385
- THIS IS THE SECOND RESIDENTIAL
BUILDING HE'S DESIGNED.

33:38.418 --> 33:40.820
HE DESIGNED ONE IN THE VILLAGE
AS WELL.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.756
BUT THIS ONE'S REALLY
A LITTLE BIT MORE UNIQUE.

33:42.789 --> 33:45.792
MY STRATEGY IS TO ADAPT
TO EACH PARTICULAR LISTING,

33:45.825 --> 33:47.494
AND I HAVE TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

33:47.527 --> 33:48.595
I HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE LISTING,

33:48.628 --> 33:50.630
THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
THE BUILDER.

33:50.663 --> 33:53.433
I HAVE TO KNOW IT ALL,
AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.001
- AND HOW'S THE AREA?
HOW'S CHELSEA?

33:55.101 --> 33:57.237
I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF
THE HOTTEST AREAS IN NEW YORK

33:57.270 --> 33:58.605
IF NOT THE WORLD
RIGHT NOW.

33:58.638 --> 33:59.773
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST AMAZING.

33:59.806 --> 34:01.074
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR YOURSELF?

34:01.107 --> 34:02.909
YOU SAID YOU REPRESENT
SOMEBODY WHO'S LOOKING?

34:02.942 --> 34:04.511
- WELL, I'M LOOKING
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE,

34:04.544 --> 34:06.680
UH, A FRENCH FRIEND
CALLED PIERRE,

34:06.713 --> 34:08.948
UM, AND HE'S LOOKING TO INVEST
INTO APARTMENTS IN NEW YORK.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.417
- OH, TO INVEST.
OKAY, GOOD.

34:10.450 --> 34:11.584
I MEAN, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF
FOREIGN INVESTORS HERE

34:11.618 --> 34:13.853
BECAUSE OF THE NAME--
JEAN NOUVEL, SO...

34:13.887 --> 34:15.855
I MEAN, ONE FRENCH GUY, THEY'RE
GONNA LOVE ANOTHER FRENCH GUY.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.891
IT'S GONNA BE A PERFECT FIT.

34:17.924 --> 34:19.526
WE CAN EMAIL HIM
SOME FLOOR PLANS,

34:19.559 --> 34:21.728
SOME MORE BUILDING INFORMATION,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

34:21.761 --> 34:22.896
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO WORK WITH HIM.

34:22.929 --> 34:23.897
- APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
- THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

34:23.930 --> 34:24.898
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.132
- THANKS.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.467
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.403
[upbeat music]

34:30.437 --> 34:31.404
* *

34:31.438 --> 34:33.440
[horn honks]

34:33.473 --> 34:35.809
- AFTER YOU.
- THANK YOU.

34:35.842 --> 34:37.711
- I'VE NOW SHOWN NICK
AND PENELOPE TWO APARTMENTS.

34:37.744 --> 34:40.914
WHEN ONE LIKED ONE,
THE OTHER ONE DISAGREED.

34:40.947 --> 34:44.250
NICK WANTS AMENITIES,
HE WANTS A MODERN BUILDING,

34:44.284 --> 34:45.752
AND HE WANTS OUTDOOR SPACE.

34:45.785 --> 34:48.588
PENNY
WANTS ALL OF THE ABOVE.

34:48.621 --> 34:52.158
SHE THINKS MAYBE--
I DON'T EVEN--I DON'T KNOW.

34:52.192 --> 34:54.227
SO I'M REALLY HOPING NOW
THAT WITH THIS THIRD ONE,

34:54.260 --> 34:56.663
I CAN GET THEM BOTH
AT LEAST ON THE SAME PAGE.

34:56.696 --> 34:59.099
WELCOME TO THE ISIS.

34:59.099 --> 35:01.601
THE ISIS IS A BEAUTIFUL
BOUTIQUE BUILDING

35:01.634 --> 35:02.836
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE,

35:02.869 --> 35:05.071
AND BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY
TWO APARTMENTS ON EACH FLOOR,

35:05.105 --> 35:07.440
IT'S PRIVATE AND PERFECT
FOR A FAMILY.

35:07.474 --> 35:08.641
THERE'S A VERY, VERY COOL
PENTHOUSE UNIT

35:08.675 --> 35:09.809
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE.

35:09.843 --> 35:11.378
- COOL.
- OKAY.

35:11.411 --> 35:14.280
- ALL RIGHT, PENTHOUSE "C."

35:15.749 --> 35:20.620
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE
CLOSEST TO WHAT WE LOOKING FOR.

35:20.653 --> 35:22.355
- DON'T LIKE THE KITCHEN.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO REDO THAT.

35:22.389 --> 35:24.057
- I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY

35:24.090 --> 35:28.962
ONE OF THE NICEST KITCHENS
WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF LAYOUT.

35:29.062 --> 35:30.563
- THE WHOLE THING
HAS TO COME OUT.

35:30.597 --> 35:31.798
GUT THE WHOLE KITCHEN.

35:31.831 --> 35:33.366
- BUT IT'S OPEN
TO THE LIVING ROOM.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.368
YOU CAN EVEN DO AN ISLAND HERE
IF YOU WANTED TO.

35:35.402 --> 35:36.736
- YOU'D HAVE TO GUT
THE WHOLE DARN THING.

35:36.770 --> 35:39.372
- YOU DON'T LIKE THE CABINETS?
- NO. I HATE THIS COLOR.

35:39.406 --> 35:40.774
- WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.
- I CAN'T STAND THIS.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.809
- YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR WAYS TO SPEND MONEY.

35:42.842 --> 35:44.110
- I CAN'T DO IT.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, RYAN?

35:44.144 --> 35:45.578
- UM, WITH SOMETHING NEW,
WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR.

35:45.612 --> 35:48.748
- IT'S UP TO YOU.
- IT'S UP TO HER, ALWAYS.

35:48.782 --> 35:51.751
[upbeat music]

35:51.785 --> 35:59.492
* *

35:59.526 --> 36:02.595
- SO THIS IS THE MAIN TERRACE
SPACE OFF THE LIVING ROOM.

36:02.629 --> 36:05.432
- IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR ME TO
STARE AT ALL THESE ROOFTOPS.

36:05.465 --> 36:06.599
- STARE AT ALL THE ROOFTOPS?

36:06.633 --> 36:07.834
- STARING AT ROOFTOPS
ALL DAY LONG.

36:07.867 --> 36:09.436
IT'S ALMOST LIKE,
YOU'RE SO LANDLOCKED HERE

36:09.469 --> 36:11.871
THAT I'M GONNA STA--EVEN THOUGH
THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE,

36:11.905 --> 36:15.508
I THINK I'M GONNA FEEL
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

36:15.542 --> 36:18.678
- WELL, AT LEAST I GOT THEM
TO AGREE ON SOMETHING.

36:18.712 --> 36:20.847
- I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE
DAYS IN OUR SCHEDULE.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.682
I THINK WE NEED TO
MAYBE SPEED IT UP

36:22.716 --> 36:26.052
AND YOU NEED TO WORK
A LITTLE HARDER.

36:26.052 --> 36:27.520
ARE WE LOOKING
IN THE RIGHT AREA?

36:27.554 --> 36:30.390
- I LOVE THE UPPER EAST SIDE.
I LOVE IT. YOU DON'T.

36:30.423 --> 36:32.459
- YEAH, I'M PICKY. I'M SORRY.
I'M VERY PICKY.

36:32.492 --> 36:34.361
- SO YOU WANT TO SEE THE WATER
AND WANT TO SEE THE CITY.

36:34.394 --> 36:36.062
- SHE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT
AS A COMMITMENT.

36:36.062 --> 36:39.799
[overlapping arguing]

36:39.833 --> 36:40.967
EXCUSE ME.

36:41.067 --> 36:44.571
- SOMETIMES I REALLY MISS
HAND MODELING.

36:44.604 --> 36:47.841
- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE ISSUES.
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

36:50.076 --> 36:53.079
[upbeat music]

36:53.079 --> 36:58.151

36:58.184 --> 37:00.820
- MMM, I LIKE THIS HOT WATER.

37:04.624 --> 37:06.459
AH.
YOU'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE.

37:06.493 --> 37:08.795
YOU WANT TO TICKLE ME.

37:08.828 --> 37:10.597
[cell phone chimes]

37:10.630 --> 37:13.500
OH, EXCUSE ME.

37:13.533 --> 37:15.101
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

37:15.135 --> 37:16.870
- HI, FREDRIK, IT'S GIOIA.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.271
- HI, GIOIA.
HOW ARE YOU?

37:18.304 --> 37:19.572
OKAY, WE HAVE A DEAL.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.444
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BAD NEWS?

37:26.379 --> 37:27.347
WELL, JUST TELL ME.

37:27.380 --> 37:30.083
- UM...

37:30.116 --> 37:32.752
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
BACKING OUT?

37:32.786 --> 37:34.788
OF THE PRICE?

37:37.791 --> 37:40.093
SO PUSH ONE BUTTON
AND GET THE SHADES DOWN.

37:40.126 --> 37:41.428
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:46.132 --> 37:48.868
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NOT NOW, NOT NOW.

37:48.902 --> 37:51.137
NOT THIS--NOT THIS DEAL.
NOT THIS ADDRESS.

37:51.171 --> 37:53.373
NOT THIS CLIENT OF MINE.
NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T.

37:53.406 --> 37:54.607
NOTHING'S BINDING

37:54.641 --> 37:57.277
UNTIL BOTH PARTIES
HAVE SIGNED THE CONTRACT.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.312
AS OF RIGHT NOW,
WE JUST HAD A HANDSHAKE.

37:59.346 --> 38:00.613
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A SOLUTION TO THIS.

38:00.647 --> 38:03.383
WE WORKED WAY TOO HARD,
BOTH YOU AND I, ON THIS.

38:03.416 --> 38:04.617
UM...

38:07.354 --> 38:08.488
DON'T SPEAK TO THEM AGAIN.

38:08.521 --> 38:10.590
I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK
WITH SOME INSTRUCTIONS.

38:10.623 --> 38:12.559
I'M NOT GONNA LET
THIS DEAL GO DOWN

38:12.592 --> 38:13.693
BECAUSE OF THE WINDOW.

38:13.727 --> 38:15.528
THAT'S THE BEST FEATURE
OF THE BUILDING.

38:15.562 --> 38:17.831
I HAVE TO THINK OF
SOMETHING QUICK.

38:17.864 --> 38:19.332
I HAVE TO SAVE THIS DEAL.

38:19.366 --> 38:20.700
I THINK--I THINK
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

38:20.734 --> 38:23.403
- YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW?
- YEAH, I HAVE TO LEAVE.

38:23.436 --> 38:24.404
- OKAY.

38:24.437 --> 38:26.906

COMING BY THE OTHER DAY
WITH YOUR CLIENT AND HIS REP.

- SURE, NO.

- OKAY, GREAT. UH, DO YOU
HAVE A NUMBER IN MIND?

39:04.577 --> 39:06.680
SO, $2.5 MILLION.

39:10.750 --> 39:15.221

YEAH--

39:15.255 --> 39:16.423
ALL CASH.

39:16.456 --> 39:18.091
THAT NUMBER
IS A LITTLE TOUGH.

39:18.124 --> 39:19.526
I MEAN, THAT'S LOW.

39:19.559 --> 39:21.494
I MEAN, NOTHING HAS TRADED
THAT LOW

39:21.528 --> 39:23.163
ON A PER-SQUARE-FOOT BASIS
IN THAT,

39:23.196 --> 39:25.198
YOU KNOW, THAT BUILDING,
THE JEAN NOUVEL BUILDING.

39:25.231 --> 39:28.034
$1 MILLION BELOW
OUR ASKING PRICE.

39:28.034 --> 39:30.403
I MEAN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IT'S INSULTING.

39:30.437 --> 39:32.339
IT'S WRONG.
IT'S STEALING.

39:32.372 --> 39:33.673
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST--

39:33.707 --> 39:34.941
I THINK WE'RE REALLY
FAR AWAY ON THE PRICE.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.876
CAN HE COME UP
A LITTLE BIT?

39:45.051 --> 39:47.253
HE'S ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE
AND I'M ALL THE WAY UP HERE.

39:47.287 --> 39:49.289
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE
GONNA MEET IN THE MIDDLE.

39:53.126 --> 39:54.094
ARE YOU FREE RIGHT NOW?

39:54.127 --> 39:55.695
CAN YOU MEET ME
OVER AT THE BUILDING

39:55.729 --> 39:58.531
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE IN,
LIKE, TWO HOURS?

39:58.565 --> 40:00.033
- UH, SURE, SURE.

40:00.066 --> 40:01.401
- I GOT AN IDEA.
- I CAN MEET YOU OVER THERE.

40:01.434 --> 40:02.535
- I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING

40:02.569 --> 40:05.438
THAT MAYBE CAN WORK OUT
FOR BOTH OF US.

40:05.472 --> 40:07.540
OKAY. NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT GONNA WASTE YOUR TIME.

40:07.574 --> 40:09.309
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
MY TIME.

40:09.342 --> 40:13.446
I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
THIS SITUATION FAST.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.382
OKAY, THANKS A LOT.
I APPRECIATE IT.

40:15.415 --> 40:18.385
THERE IS NO TIME
TO BE WASTED.

40:18.418 --> 40:19.486
- COMING UP...

40:19.519 --> 40:21.287
- OKAY, FREDRIK,
I'M READY FOR OUR TEST.

40:21.321 --> 40:23.056

- THANKS FOR COMING.
- NO, OF COURSE.

40:39.539 --> 40:41.107
- I AM NOT GONNA
LET THIS FALL THROUGH.

40:41.141 --> 40:43.376
I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT, SWEATING.

40:43.410 --> 40:47.247
I CALLED GIOIA AT 6:00 A.M.
TIME KILLS ALL DEALS.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.215
I GOTTA FIX THIS
WITHIN 24 HOURS.

40:49.249 --> 40:51.284
FIRST OF ALL, FOR THE RECORD,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:51.317 --> 40:52.952
IT'S NOT A FISHBOWL.

40:52.986 --> 40:55.055
IF ANYTHING,
IT'S A JEWEL BOX.

40:55.088 --> 40:56.690
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
LOOK AT ALL THIS GLASS.

40:56.723 --> 40:58.191
- FREDRIK, FREDRIK, YOU AND I
LIVE IN NEW YORK.

40:58.224 --> 40:59.592
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THESE PEOPLE.

40:59.626 --> 41:02.095
THEY ARE NOT FROM NEW YORK,
AND THEY'RE SCARED.

41:02.128 --> 41:04.698
THEY'RE SCARED ABOUT
THE WINDOWS, THE PRIVACY.

41:04.731 --> 41:06.466
- TAKE THIS.

41:06.499 --> 41:07.600
YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN THERE

41:07.634 --> 41:09.135
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF PARK AVENUE

41:09.169 --> 41:10.637
AND PRETEND
YOU'RE SOME WEIRDO

41:10.670 --> 41:13.139
JUST WALKING BY,
A RANDOM PERSON, LOOKING UP.

41:13.173 --> 41:14.841
I'M GONNA BE STANDING
RIGHT HERE,

41:14.874 --> 41:16.142
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT

41:16.176 --> 41:17.143
FOR YOU TO SEE ME.

41:17.177 --> 41:18.478
THERE'S NO CONCERN.

41:18.511 --> 41:20.246
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR BUYERS ON THE PHONE

41:20.280 --> 41:22.515
AS WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW,
IN PARIS,

41:22.549 --> 41:23.917
AND YOU'RE GONNA
CONVINCE THEM.

41:23.950 --> 41:25.919
- WELL, LET ME GET THESE ON
SO I CAN SEE PROPERLY.

41:25.952 --> 41:29.189
- HELLO? IS THIS PARIS?
YOU'RE BUYING THE APARTMENT.

41:29.222 --> 41:31.224
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- UH...

41:31.257 --> 41:33.526
- I'M NOT VERY TECHNICAL, BUT--
- OH. [laughs]

41:33.560 --> 41:35.395
- [amplified] HELLO?
- AAH!

41:35.428 --> 41:36.996
- OKAY, WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS.

41:37.097 --> 41:39.833
ZACH WAS VERY PARTICULAR WHEN
HE DEVELOPED THIS BUILDING.

41:39.866 --> 41:41.234
IT HAS LARGE WINDOWS
AND GREAT VIEWS

41:41.267 --> 41:42.836
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE INSIDE,

41:42.869 --> 41:45.438
AND ALSO IT REFLECTS WHEN YOU'RE
LOOKING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE.

41:45.472 --> 41:48.341
DO I KNOW FOR CERTAIN
THAT THIS IS GONNA WORK?

41:48.375 --> 41:50.910
NO.
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

41:50.944 --> 41:52.779
- OKAY, FREDRIK,
I'M READY FOR OUR TEST.

41:52.812 --> 41:55.115
ARE YOU STANDING THERE?
I CAN'T SEEM TO SEE YOU.

41:55.115 --> 41:56.683
- WELL, I'M STANDING
IN THE WINDOW,

41:56.716 --> 41:59.119
ARE I CAN DEFINITELY
SEE YOU, MY LOVE.

41:59.119 --> 42:01.221
THAT PINK SHIRT
LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

42:01.254 --> 42:02.555
- I DON'T SEE YOU.
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

42:02.589 --> 42:04.891
- YOU DON'T SEE ME
AT ALL RIGHT NOW?

42:04.924 --> 42:09.129
- NO, I DON'T SEE YOU.

42:09.162 --> 42:10.530
- I'M ON THE BALCONY.

42:10.563 --> 42:12.198
HERE, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO SEE ME,

42:12.232 --> 42:14.968
BUT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE BALCONY

42:15.068 --> 42:18.972
AND WHEN I GO INSIDE.

42:19.072 --> 42:22.175
- WELL, FREDRIK,
I DON'T REALLY SEE YOU,

42:22.208 --> 42:23.977
SO THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS.

42:24.077 --> 42:25.745
- OKAY, AND I'M GONNA PUT
THE SHADES NOW

42:25.779 --> 42:28.081
TO REALLY PROVE MY POINT.

42:29.082 --> 42:32.352
CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?

42:32.385 --> 42:35.088
- OKAY, FREDRIK,
I'M SATISFIED.

42:35.088 --> 42:36.990
- IF YOU WANT TO WALK AROUND
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR

42:37.090 --> 42:39.726
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM,
YOU CAN USE THE SHADES.

42:39.759 --> 42:42.262
I MEAN, I DO IT ALL THE TIME
IN MY APARTMENT.

42:42.295 --> 42:43.530
OH, YOU'RE WET.

42:43.563 --> 42:45.765
- SOAKING WET,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

42:45.799 --> 42:48.335
I COULD HARDLY SEE YOU.
I SAW A LITTLE SILHOUETTE.

42:48.368 --> 42:50.003
- I WAS STANDING HERE,
LIKE, THE WHOLE TIME,

42:50.103 --> 42:51.104
AND YOU COULDN'T REALLY
SEE ME, RIGHT?

42:51.104 --> 42:52.672
- VERY FAINTLY.
VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

42:52.706 --> 42:54.341
- MAYBE, LIKE, THE WHITE SHIRT,
LIKE A LITTLE BIT.

42:54.374 --> 42:55.942
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

42:55.975 --> 42:57.010
SO ANYWAY,
WHILE I WAS OUTSIDE,

42:57.110 --> 42:59.012
I TALKED TO THEM
LIKE WE SAID WE WOULD.

42:59.112 --> 43:00.113
- YOU CALLED THEM IN PARIS?

43:00.146 --> 43:02.248
- I CALLED THEM IN PARIS,
IN THE RAIN.

43:02.282 --> 43:06.386
AND, UH, I MANAGED TO
TALK THEM OFF THE LEDGE

43:06.419 --> 43:08.054
AND THEY WANT IT
AND THEY'RE GONNA GO BACK,

43:08.054 --> 43:11.358
REVERT TO OUR OFFER
AS BEFORE, $3,830,000.

43:11.391 --> 43:12.892
SO FREDRIK,
I THINK WE HAVE A DEAL.

43:12.926 --> 43:14.861
- OH, MY GOD.
THANK YOU.

43:14.894 --> 43:16.463
- AND YOU'RE NOT AN ASS
ANYMORE.

43:16.496 --> 43:17.864
- I'M NOT?
- NO.

43:17.897 --> 43:21.534
