JOHN: Dale.

00:56.341 --> 00:57.899
Morning, John Redcorn.

Peggy. Just dropping off
a new healing herb for Nancy...

01:02.114 --> 01:04.513
to help with her migraines. Ginkgo biloba.

01:04.616 --> 01:06.709

Well, you must be reading Doyle Harcavy.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.598
What's he got for us this morning?

01:23.702 --> 01:28.002
''When it comes to starting the day,
nothing wakes me up faster than coffee.''

01:29.074 --> 01:30.905
Boy, he's got that right.

01:32.477 --> 01:36.277
''They say children are a blessing,
but mine are holy terrors.''

01:39.484 --> 01:41.452
Doyle Harcavy knows children.

jumped out a window.

[Sighing]

01:51.863 --> 01:55.697
l don't believe it. Doyle Harcavy
is retiring from the musings column.

01:55.801 --> 01:56.790
No.

01:56.902 --> 02:00.394
He's going to write product descriptions
for Bradley Air and Heat.

-l don't know how they'll ever replace him.
-l know how.

02:03.975 --> 02:07.001
You can write that column, Aunt Peggy.
You're a natural.

02:07.112 --> 02:10.172
Now, Luanne, Peggy has a musing
now and then...

02:10.282 --> 02:12.876

all day long.

l just had to get out of that house.

03:51.550 --> 03:54.485
l am trying to do some creative work,
and Hank seems to think...

03:54.586 --> 03:57.453
that he's helping by making me
more and more stressed-out.

03:57.556 --> 03:59.615
lt is giving me a whopping headache.

03:59.724 --> 04:02.158
Yes. Headaches can often
be caused by stress.

13:08.175 --> 13:09.369
But l like it.

13:09.609 --> 13:13.101
Dale will never find us here.
And we need to talk alone.

13:13.547 --> 13:16.141
Does it bother anyone
that we've known for years...

13:16.249 --> 13:18.717
what's going on with Nancy,
and Dale doesn't?

13:18.819 --> 13:21.913
[Overacting] Nancy's having an affair
with John Redcorn?

13:22.022 --> 13:23.922
This is the first l've heard of it.

13:24.024 --> 13:28.552
l am shocked, l mean, l am shocked.
That's what l mean, l am appalled.

13:28.662 --> 13:31.324
You don't want to be prying
into them family secrets.

13:31.431 --> 13:34.093
You don't want get
any old skeletons in no closet, man.

13:34.201 --> 13:36.499
Just like that little turd
Orville Redenbacher, man.

13:36.603 --> 13:38.594
Turns out he was just
a dang old actor, man.

13:38.705 --> 13:41.674
Look, can't we just discuss it
for five seconds?

13:41.775 --> 13:45.040
l don't believe it. l've known
Dale and Nancy for years...

13:45.145 --> 13:47.306
and they have a fairy-book marriage.

13:47.781 --> 13:49.214
Shut up, Bill.

13:51.451 --> 13:52.418
[Doorbell ringing]

13:54.521 --> 13:57.183
Why, Dale, how nice to see you.

13:57.524 --> 14:00.015
l can't find Hank, Bill, or Boomhauer.

14:00.193 --> 14:01.182
[Clears throat]

14:01.294 --> 14:05.594
lf they're hiding behind the door,
just nod slowly.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.861
You sweet man.

14:08.034 --> 14:10.366
You know, l have been thinking
a lot about you.

14:10.470 --> 14:13.337
We never get to talk, you and l.
Why is that?

14:14.775 --> 14:18.370
Anyway, Nancy should count herself lucky
to have a man like you.

14:18.712 --> 14:23.376
Just look at you.
The way that hat accents your head.

14:24.084 --> 14:27.349
Plenty of women would be happy
to have you. Good women.

14:28.822 --> 14:30.813
Would you like to come in for some pie?

14:30.957 --> 14:31.924
[Clears throat]

14:32.159 --> 14:33.524
l should go.

14:33.927 --> 14:36.327
Hey, Dale. What's going on?

14:36.430 --> 14:40.560
Not much. Peggy Hill wants to leave Hank
and run away with me.

14:40.700 --> 14:44.192
[Overacting] l don't believe it.
They have a fairy-book marriage.

14:44.604 --> 14:47.801
''Let's face it.
Angie Dickinson has lost her looks.''

14:50.143 --> 14:54.512
''Mix pineapple juice with club soda,
you've got yourself a big bucket of crap.''

14:56.183 --> 14:59.175
Well, go ahead, say it. They're terrible.

14:59.586 --> 15:02.077
How can l appreciate
the little things in life...

15:02.189 --> 15:04.657
when so many big things
are wrong and evil?

15:05.158 --> 15:06.989
Don't worry, Aunt Peggy.

15:07.227 --> 15:11.823
l'm sure that even Doyle Harcavy
had trouble sometimes.

15:12.098 --> 15:15.761
Doyle Harcavy. lf you ask me,
Doyle Harcavy wasn't that good.

15:15.869 --> 15:16.836
[Gasps]

15:16.937 --> 15:20.737
Thank you, Mom.
lt's about time somebody said it.

15:20.874 --> 15:23.707
Of course coffee wakes you up
in the morning.

15:23.810 --> 15:26.370
l mean, that's how they advertise it.

15:27.581 --> 15:28.946
HANK: You'll see.

15:29.049 --> 15:32.382
Being with the Gribbles when you know
about Nancy is weird at first...

15:32.486 --> 15:34.511
but it goes away after a few years.

15:34.621 --> 15:37.021
lt helps if you think of something else.

15:37.591 --> 15:40.059
l use sports. You can use Boggle.

15:40.327 --> 15:42.261
All right. You guys are just in time.

15:42.362 --> 15:45.525
Boomhauer's on second
and Nancy's healer's at bat.

15:48.635 --> 15:52.332
Man, look at that John Redcorn.
He sure can swing.

15:52.539 --> 15:53.506
[Dale hooting]

15:54.341 --> 15:55.968
[Tense instrumental music]

15:58.245 --> 15:59.906
-Good eye.
-Are you kidding?

16:00.013 --> 16:03.380
This guy never strikes out.
Ain't that right, Nancy?

16:05.919 --> 16:07.784
Boggle. Think Boggle.

16:08.221 --> 16:10.212
All right, wingo, man.

16:11.358 --> 16:13.292
Redcorn's gonna score again.

16:13.693 --> 16:16.423
''Score.'' ''Scores.'' ''Core.'' ''Cores.''

16:16.563 --> 16:18.155
''Sore.'' ''Sores.''

16:18.265 --> 16:21.564
All right, come on, John. Come on.
He's going all the way.

16:22.202 --> 16:24.067
l have to get out of here.

16:24.170 --> 16:25.797
Ball park nachos.

16:26.273 --> 16:29.003
You don't buy them. You only rent them.

16:29.242 --> 16:31.972
l'm done, Hank.
My rose-colored glasses are off...

16:32.078 --> 16:34.876
and the world looks
flesh-colored and unappealing.

16:34.981 --> 16:36.949
l cannot live the lie anymore.

16:37.050 --> 16:38.711
lt takes two to talk about it...

16:38.818 --> 16:41.753
and everyone else already knows
and isn't interested.

16:42.622 --> 16:44.283
No, not everybody knows, Hank.

16:44.391 --> 16:48.487
l can think of one person who doesn't.
The one person who really should.

16:49.195 --> 16:50.355
[Dale cheering]

16:50.463 --> 16:54.365
All right. Way to go, Big Bad John.

16:58.572 --> 16:59.869
Hold up, Peggy.

16:59.973 --> 17:03.909
You can't just walk back over there
and tell Dale his wife's cheating on him.

17:04.010 --> 17:06.171
Just let sleeping dogs lie.

17:06.279 --> 17:09.737
lnteresting choice of words, Mr. Hill. ''Lie! ''

17:09.848 --> 17:11.510
l meant lie down.

17:11.617 --> 17:15.611
l know that, Hank.
Dogs don't tell lies. Only people lie.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.953
They lie like dogs.

17:23.696 --> 17:25.561
[Sander whirring]

17:27.367 --> 17:31.030
Hank, there's something l just figured out
and you need to know.

17:31.705 --> 17:33.536
Sorry, l can't hear you.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.438
Probably none of my business anyway.
Sander.

17:39.412 --> 17:40.379
[Grunting]

17:42.315 --> 17:44.306
Hank, it's important.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.756
Your wife loves me
and wants us to run off together.

17:50.890 --> 17:53.358
l've not yet been able to ascertain where,

17:53.460 --> 17:56.520
-Dale--
-No problemo on this end.

17:56.630 --> 17:58.723
l don't even find her attractive.

17:58.832 --> 18:03.360
Of course you do, and l appreciate the lie.
But Peggy's just being nice to you.

18:03.470 --> 18:06.268
But you're a good friend
for wanting to tell me.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.302
lf the shoe were on the other foot,
would you want to know?

18:11.411 --> 18:13.140
Don't flatter yourself, Hank.

18:13.246 --> 18:16.181
Nancy likes her men thin and pale of face.

18:16.416 --> 18:18.850
l thank God every day
for sending me an angel...

18:18.952 --> 18:21.944
with the hots for my track team physique.

18:30.063 --> 18:32.554
PEGGY: ''You hear the expression,
'Lie like a dog, ',,,

18:32.666 --> 18:34.998
''often enough that it is almost a cliché,

18:35.335 --> 18:37.030
''But more often than not,,,

''if someone is lying to you,
they are a person,

18:39.973 --> 18:43.101
''We all know a certain person
who is lying to her husband,

''Every time we look the other way,
we add a lie to a lie,

''Well, this reporter
is not gonna lie anymore,

''And you can print that, ''

19:00.660 --> 19:02.594
-Excuse me.
-Sug', listen.

19:02.696 --> 19:05.563
l love Dale, but in a lights-on sort of way.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.564
l feel for you, l really do.

19:07.667 --> 19:11.330
But you married for better or worse,
and worse includes Dale.

19:11.671 --> 19:14.970
-Now, either you tell him or l will.
-Peggy, please.

19:15.308 --> 19:18.106
-l'm not going to--
-Well, then get out of my way.

[Sighing]

19:30.290 --> 19:31.348
Hey, Dale.

19:31.624 --> 19:34.821
l thought l'd like to take
a little of my own advice this morning.

19:34.928 --> 19:38.364
-Having some waffles, are you?
-No, l meant the longer one.

19:38.465 --> 19:39.932
About sleeping dogs.

19:40.533 --> 19:43.661
Dale, l have to tell you
something very important.

19:45.772 --> 19:47.000
HANK: Oh, no.

19:47.207 --> 19:48.174
Dale...

19:48.775 --> 19:51.676
Nancy is not the wife you think she is.

19:51.778 --> 19:53.541
And John Redcorn...

19:53.646 --> 19:56.114
he is not the friend that you think he is.

19:56.216 --> 19:58.548
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

19:58.685 --> 20:03.054
Nancy and John Redcorn
did something to your dog?

20:03.156 --> 20:05.556
No, damn it, Dale.
Nancy and John Redcorn are--

20:05.658 --> 20:08.889
-Hey, Dad!
-Just a sec, Peggy. Yes, son?

20:09.362 --> 20:12.798
Me and Bobby are bored. What do we do?

20:12.999 --> 20:14.796
How about renting a videotape?

20:14.901 --> 20:18.268
Yeah, we want to see Encino Man,
but we don't have any money.

20:18.438 --> 20:22.397
Pauly Shore, 1992 classic.

20:23.576 --> 20:27.535
l got two fives, one for you, one for me.

20:27.847 --> 20:29.144
Thanks, Dad.

20:30.216 --> 20:32.582
Wait. l found some more.

20:34.053 --> 20:36.681
Can't watch Encino Man
without milk balls, huh?

20:37.390 --> 20:38.823
Thanks, Dad!

20:42.662 --> 20:44.493
Sorry about that, Peggy.

20:45.231 --> 20:47.324

20:47.534 --> 20:48.501
Dale...

20:49.903 --> 20:51.666
l just found out...

20:52.639 --> 20:55.767
that Vikings were the first visitors
to the moon.

20:56.276 --> 20:57.470
l knew that.

20:57.577 --> 21:00.512
Why do you think we named
our spacecraft after them?

21:01.047 --> 21:04.380
-Poor naive Peggy.
-That makes sense.

21:05.084 --> 21:07.484
l'm so glad
you and l could have this little talk.

21:07.587 --> 21:09.145
l feel so much better.

21:09.722 --> 21:11.417
Okay, l guess.

21:13.993 --> 21:15.255
Peggy?

21:16.162 --> 21:17.857
You got a good husband there.

21:17.964 --> 21:20.489
He doesn't have the best body
on the alley...

21:20.900 --> 21:23.368
but he's got a good head on his shoulders.

21:24.204 --> 21:25.535
Yeah, l know.

21:31.978 --> 21:33.969
Well, how'd he take it?

21:35.281 --> 21:37.146
l couldn't tell him.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.980
l guess some things are best left unsaid.

Yep.

-You know, Hank, l really--
-l know.

21:43.590 --> 21:44.614
-And, Peggy--
-l got you.
