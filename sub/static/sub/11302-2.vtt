You like Florida Georgia Line?

01:35.864 --> 01:38.407
You like annoying a man
holding a skill saw?

01:42.161 --> 01:44.163
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

01:44.247 --> 01:46.791
That would imply that I slept.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.210
I've been layin' awake all night

01:49.293 --> 01:51.880
thinking of this money pit
we call a ranch.

01:51.963 --> 01:53.506
Oh, well, you should try warm milk.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.550
Or tea.

01:57.719 --> 01:59.053
We got a lot of work to do.

01:59.888 --> 02:02.223
So all I want to hear
from now on is silence.

02:04.142 --> 02:06.477
You know, Dad,
you can't really hear silence.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.979
It's actually the absence of all...

02:09.479 --> 02:12.525
Your silence speaks volumes.

02:15.444 --> 02:17.697
All right,
I think I got everything.

02:17.781 --> 02:22.410
The two-by-fours, four-by-fours,
two-by-sixes...

02:22.493 --> 02:25.454
Oh, yeah, I also brought a couple guns.

02:25.538 --> 02:26.665
Boom!

02:29.542 --> 02:31.252
Let's do this.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.130
Oh, that's Dad's hammer.

02:34.213 --> 02:36.340
All right. Cool story, bro.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.342
No, no, no.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.179
Any tool that says "Beau" on it
is off limits.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.098
Also, any tool that says "Pedro" is mine.

02:44.182 --> 02:45.934
I stole them from my boy Pedro.

02:47.351 --> 02:48.602
That's enough.

02:48.687 --> 02:51.397
You're not gonna need a hammer.
You need a shovel.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.817
You're gonna go shovel out the bull barn.

02:55.651 --> 02:56.945
Why can't I help up here?

02:57.946 --> 03:00.614
I need somebody up here
that knows what they're doing.

03:00.699 --> 03:02.200
Well, I know what I'm doing!

03:02.283 --> 03:04.703
All you're doing right now
is slowing us down.

03:04.786 --> 03:06.871
And I know that, too.

03:08.998 --> 03:11.084
I don't see why I gotta do
all the grunt work.

03:12.335 --> 03:14.963
Colt, let me explain
something to you, all right?

03:15.046 --> 03:17.506
Now, the three of us
are like a totem pole.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.968
Dad's up on top.

03:20.051 --> 03:23.429
He's an eagle, you know,
soaring above us all.

03:23.512 --> 03:26.766
He's rare, but when you catch a glimpse,
it's magical.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.062
Now, below him is me, the rooster.

03:31.145 --> 03:33.022
But, like, a badass rooster.

03:33.106 --> 03:36.359
I'm the first one up in the morning,
and I'm on the label of hot sauce bottles.

03:36.442 --> 03:40.071
All right, what am I?
Like, a wolf or... a lion?

03:43.241 --> 03:46.077
You're like a beaver, right?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.370
Just swimming around,

03:47.453 --> 03:50.581
gathering the wood and the crap
that the rooster and the eagle need

03:50.664 --> 03:52.416
to build the dam
to keep the water out.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.669
Wow, I am not gonna lie to you.

03:55.754 --> 03:58.047
I did not know where this analogy
was going when I first started,

03:58.131 --> 04:00.383
but it is rock fucking solid.

04:04.553 --> 04:06.597
- Rooster?
- Yes, my eagle.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.641
Shut up.

04:11.435 --> 04:12.686
See you at lunch.

04:13.772 --> 04:14.939
See ya later, Beave.

04:18.151 --> 04:21.570
You know, in 8th grade,
I used your toothbrush to scrub my balls.

04:26.617 --> 04:29.370
Well, there he is.
We thought you were out for the night.

04:29.453 --> 04:31.039
Dad was gonna put a blanket on you,

04:31.122 --> 04:33.624
I was gonna come over
and draw a dick on your forehead.

04:36.252 --> 04:38.296
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.381
You guys already ate?
You couldn't have woke me?

04:41.299 --> 04:42.675
We eat dinner at 6:00.

04:43.426 --> 04:44.969
I got a lot of things to do around here,

04:45.053 --> 04:47.555
waking a grown man from his nap
isn't one of them.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.599
Why didn't you say anything?

04:50.683 --> 04:54.353
Well, I could have,
but this way I got two steaks for dinner.

04:56.189 --> 04:58.900
Plus, I got to hear Dad
make fun of your nap for dessert. So...

05:01.069 --> 05:02.361
The meat's gone.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.824
There's a baked potato
and half a scoop of beans there.

05:05.907 --> 05:08.201
The meat's gone?

05:09.702 --> 05:11.287
Hey, we working on the barn
again tomorrow?

05:11.370 --> 05:14.123
We'll get the paper
and the shingles on in the morning.

05:14.207 --> 05:16.250
We can have Colt
ride the fence on the north side,

05:16.334 --> 05:18.294
see if that storm knocked any limbs down.

05:18.377 --> 05:20.629
- Mmm-hmm.
- That ain't even a half a scoop.

05:20.713 --> 05:23.007
That's, like, four beans and a ham bone.

05:24.258 --> 05:28.054
Don't touch that ham bone.
It's for the dog.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.391
Yeah, by the way,
since when do you allow dogs in the house?

05:32.934 --> 05:36.687
Better question would be
why I allow you and Rooster in the house.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:38.606 --> 05:40.358
Friendly fire there, Eagle.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.527
It's beaver hunting season.

05:46.364 --> 05:49.783
Oh, man, am I full.
I should not have eaten that second steak.

05:52.703 --> 05:56.207
Hey, Dad, uh, I was thinking,
since we're re-doing the barn roof,

05:56.290 --> 05:59.878
we could run a drain pipe
down to a cistern, catch the run-off.

05:59.961 --> 06:02.296
It's extra water for the cattle
and irrigation.

06:03.006 --> 06:04.257
That's a great idea.

06:05.049 --> 06:07.676
- Thank you.
- Rooster and I were just discussing

06:07.760 --> 06:10.596
how we wish we had
a few more projects around here.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.766
Dad, I'm just trying to help.

06:13.849 --> 06:18.021
Unless you got any more ideas,
I got bills to pay.

06:18.938 --> 06:21.983
Uh, actually...
I got another idea.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.528
I could set you up
so you could pay those bills online.

06:25.611 --> 06:27.821
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pull back, man. Abort.

06:29.407 --> 06:31.951
Why would I put my bankin' info online?

06:32.035 --> 06:35.538
So half the population of China
can pay their bills with it, too?

06:37.206 --> 06:40.960
Rooster, go grab a pen
and draw that dick on your brother's head.

06:49.302 --> 06:50.303
Hey, sweetheart.

06:50.929 --> 06:53.847
Hello to you, my sweet Margaret.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.394
I was talking to my son.

06:58.477 --> 07:00.229
Worth a shot.

07:02.398 --> 07:05.484
Give me a whiskey the size you'd need
if you were still living with Dad.

07:16.454 --> 07:19.873
- Rough day with him?
- Actually, I didn't see him all day.

07:19.958 --> 07:24.295
He was up in the loft with Rooster.
I was scooping shit with Pedro's shovel.

07:25.754 --> 07:29.467
Now my back is killing me.
I don't know who this Pedro guy was...

07:29.550 --> 07:32.011
must've been a very short man.

07:32.971 --> 07:35.014
Well, I still love you, sweetheart.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.433
So just to be clear,

07:37.516 --> 07:40.769
"sweetheart" is always
in reference to him?

07:42.230 --> 07:45.524
Did I ever tell you about the first date
I ever had with your father?

07:45.608 --> 07:46.817
It was on the ranch.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.404
We worked all day, had dinner,
promptly at 6:00.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.907
I didn't even know it was a date
until he said...

07:54.533 --> 07:56.160
"You wanna stay
for breakfast?"

07:59.872 --> 08:02.166
So, what're you saying?
Dad's always been a jackass?

08:02.250 --> 08:05.086
No, my point is that
every relationship with your father

08:05.169 --> 08:07.380
begins with hard work on the ranch.

08:07.463 --> 08:10.633
And you just gotta keep proving yourself.

08:10.716 --> 08:13.052
And that he's, you know,
always been kind of a jackass.

08:16.180 --> 08:18.391
Wow, look at you.

08:20.059 --> 08:22.520
Abby. Hey.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.438
Hey.

08:26.482 --> 08:29.110
Standing at a bar
with a bottle of whiskey in your hand.

08:29.193 --> 08:31.862
Some things never change.

08:32.321 --> 08:34.657
- Hey, Mrs. Bennett.
- Hey, darlin'.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.741
No!

08:38.952 --> 08:41.496
- What can I get for you, Abby?
- Oh, just a water.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.332
Water?

08:43.416 --> 08:45.668
Huh. Well, let me check in the back.

08:48.171 --> 08:49.630
Crazy seeing you.

08:49.713 --> 08:52.966
- Yeah.
- You look great.

08:53.051 --> 08:55.636
- Oh.
- Uh, what you been up to?

08:55.719 --> 08:58.389
Well, I'm teaching history
over at Garrison.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.266
- Really?
- Oh, and a couple times a year,

09:00.349 --> 09:01.892
I put a condom on a banana.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.229
Right.

09:05.313 --> 09:06.314
Sex ed?

09:06.397 --> 09:07.565
No.

09:12.611 --> 09:13.612
Why...

09:13.696 --> 09:16.157
I'm messing with you.
It is sex ed.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.908
All right.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.618
So how about you?
What are you up to?

09:20.328 --> 09:23.414
Me? Come on.
I'm great! Yeah.

09:23.497 --> 09:24.873
Things have been going good.

09:24.957 --> 09:28.169
I was playing football,
at the top of my game, and then...

09:28.252 --> 09:30.546
Dad called and said
he needed some help at home,

09:30.629 --> 09:35.218
so I, uh, decided it was time to be
MVP of life and not just football.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.137
Still full of shit, huh?

09:43.267 --> 09:46.479
Wow. A Colt Bennett without football.

09:46.562 --> 09:49.523
That's like the Battle of Hastings
without the death of King Edward.

09:49.607 --> 09:51.150
Right?

09:51.234 --> 09:52.651
Right.

09:55.363 --> 09:57.240
Is that, like, a <i>Game of Thrones</i> thing?

09:59.367 --> 10:00.576
Are you serious?

10:01.869 --> 10:04.372
No.

10:04.455 --> 10:08.126
I was just kidding
like you did with the banana thing.

10:10.169 --> 10:12.130
It really is good seeing you again.

10:12.921 --> 10:13.922
You, too.

10:14.006 --> 10:16.342
Holy cow!

10:16.425 --> 10:17.843
I can't believe it!

10:17.926 --> 10:18.927
Colt Bennett!

10:19.011 --> 10:21.054
Hey, buddy.
I'll sign something for you in a second.

10:21.139 --> 10:22.223
I'm just catching up
with an old friend here.

10:22.306 --> 10:24.850
No, actually, this is my boyfriend, Kenny.

10:26.935 --> 10:29.105
Oh. Yeah. Boyfriend. Nice.

10:29.188 --> 10:31.149
Hey, nice to meet you, bud.

10:31.232 --> 10:34.568
Colt, don't you remember?
He went to Garrison with us.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.446
Oh, my God!

10:38.906 --> 10:42.160
Kenny! Yeah!

10:42.243 --> 10:44.787
Third period! It's...
Biology?

10:45.704 --> 10:47.790
It's okay.
We didn't really hang in the same circles.

10:47.873 --> 10:48.874
My big thing was band.

10:50.626 --> 10:53.171
Oh, band! Yeah, cool!

10:53.254 --> 10:55.339
Heck yeah, you guys used to play
"Eye of the Tiger"

10:55.423 --> 10:56.757
when we came out of the tunnel.

10:57.966 --> 10:59.218
That was awesome.

11:00.261 --> 11:04.640
Well, Kenny is the manager
of the Courtyard by Marriott in Telluride.

11:04.723 --> 11:07.059
Well, uh, technically,
we're outside of Telluride,

11:07.143 --> 11:10.813
but we do get a lot of business with
skiers and other winter sport enthusiasts.

11:10.896 --> 11:13.148
Being a part of the Marriott family
is awesome.

11:13.232 --> 11:15.526
You would not believe
the discounts he gets.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.736
I mean, last year we went to Omaha.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.197
Just because.

11:23.534 --> 11:26.287
How do you even get a job like that?

11:26.370 --> 11:28.622
That's a great question, Colt.
I, um...

11:28.706 --> 11:31.500
I started out as a bellhop,
and I just worked my way up.

11:31.584 --> 11:34.753
Most folks think you need a degree,
but, really, it's all about people skills.

11:34.837 --> 11:38.382
The key word in "hospitality management"
is "hospitality."

11:40.551 --> 11:42.470
But it's also "management."

11:44.054 --> 11:45.848
Oh, uh, sweetie,
before I forget, I, uh...

11:45.931 --> 11:47.766
booked us a room
for our anniversary.

11:47.850 --> 11:50.269
- Not gonna tell you where.
- Let me guess.

11:50.353 --> 11:51.770
The Marriott?

11:53.188 --> 11:54.732
Dude!

11:57.025 --> 11:58.402
Thank you.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.616
Shoot, you know what?
I just realized I got my old man's truck,

12:03.699 --> 12:06.702
so I gotta get it back
before it gets too late.

12:06.785 --> 12:09.872
Oh, uh... okay.
Are you sure?

12:09.955 --> 12:11.415
Yeah.

12:11.499 --> 12:14.877
It's nice to see you, Abby.
You too, Kenny.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.630
Yeah, hey, uh, if you ever
get sick of staying at home,

12:17.713 --> 12:20.466
Marriott's got 4,200 locations worldwide.

12:20.549 --> 12:24.512
Uh, I can, uh, get you
the family discount, Cousin Colt.

12:26.472 --> 12:29.725
Yeah, maybe you can play
the "Eye of the Tiger" when I check in.

12:29.808 --> 12:30.893
Hey.

12:35.981 --> 12:36.982
Here you go.

12:37.065 --> 12:39.902
Light beer.
It's the closest I could get to water.

12:40.819 --> 12:42.195
Thanks.

12:43.071 --> 12:46.742
There he is. Kenneth Ballard.

12:46.825 --> 12:51.997
"Activities: Marching band,
jazz band...

12:52.915 --> 12:54.124
French club...

12:55.668 --> 12:57.878
chess club."

12:57.961 --> 13:00.130
Guess they couldn't fit "virgin club."

13:02.174 --> 13:03.842
You know, there's a lot worse guys
in this town

13:03.926 --> 13:05.928
- who could be dating your ex.
- Yeah, like who?

13:06.011 --> 13:08.138
Oh, I don't know. Like me?

13:09.932 --> 13:11.850
Yeah, like that'd happen.

13:11.934 --> 13:13.436
All right, full disclosure.

13:14.437 --> 13:19.567
One time, Fourth of July, both drunk,
back of the truck, boots on, sex.

13:22.194 --> 13:23.362
What the hell, man?

13:23.446 --> 13:24.905
Nah, I'm just kidding.

13:26.156 --> 13:27.741
Or am I?

13:32.538 --> 13:35.833
- Who's that?
- Oh, booty call.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.669
- Linda Miller.
- Linda Miller?

13:40.003 --> 13:43.131
Wait, is that Cute Linda
or Pregnant Linda?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.635
They're both cute.

13:47.177 --> 13:49.847
Pregnant Linda!

13:50.848 --> 13:53.851
You're dating Pregnant Linda!

13:55.060 --> 13:57.145
Come on, man,
that was her nickname in 10th grade.

13:57.229 --> 13:59.231
That kid's in juvie now.

14:00.524 --> 14:03.986
But her other four are real cool.
We mostly play Xbox.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.447
Any of them kids yours?

14:06.530 --> 14:09.783
No, no, we are real careful.
We only have sex when she's pregnant.

14:12.995 --> 14:15.914
Man, it is good to have you back.

14:15.998 --> 14:17.958
Just like old times.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.586
Talking, having fun.

14:20.669 --> 14:23.547
Plus, when I sit on the porch
and drink alone, I'm an alcoholic,

14:23.631 --> 14:26.509
but when you're here,
it's just two brothers bonding.

14:27.885 --> 14:30.554
Yeah. Bonding. Great.

14:30.638 --> 14:33.265
Hey, so how long's Abby and Kenny
been going out?

14:33.349 --> 14:35.142
I don't know.
What do you care for?

14:35.934 --> 14:38.937
We dated all through high school.
That was, like, four years.

14:39.021 --> 14:40.773
Maybe for you. Nerd.

14:43.025 --> 14:46.779
I don't know, it's just weird, you know,
seeing her with another guy.

14:46.862 --> 14:48.321
Yeah.

14:48.406 --> 14:49.990
Kenny's pretty cool, actually.

14:50.073 --> 14:51.700
I passed out on his porch one night,

14:51.784 --> 14:54.202
woke up,
there was a little mint next to my head.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.831
Will you two shut the hell up?

15:00.125 --> 15:01.960
It was Colt.
Yeah, Colt was talking.

15:02.044 --> 15:04.212
Want me to go inside
and get your belt?

15:04.296 --> 15:06.048
And your pants?

15:07.758 --> 15:09.217
It's ten o'clock.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.470
Next time I get up, we're going to work.

15:11.554 --> 15:14.890
So if you want to start in the middle
of the night, keep making noise.

15:17.643 --> 15:19.978
Who in the hell's
coming up my driveway?

15:22.272 --> 15:27.403
Looks like a blue Ranger, rally lights...
Oh, I think that's Abby's truck.

15:27.486 --> 15:29.362
Whoa, it is Abby.

15:29.447 --> 15:31.740
Tell her to shut the hell up, too.

15:34.952 --> 15:38.789
- Hey, Abby!
- Hey, what's going on?

15:40.624 --> 15:42.960
Hey, Colt. Rooster.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.670
Hey, would you do me a favor?

15:44.753 --> 15:47.172
When you go to school tomorrow,
could you say hey to Shari for me?

15:47.798 --> 15:50.258
It's the new Spanish teacher.
So hot.

15:51.469 --> 15:55.848
She's, like, 50,
but looks at least <i>diez años</i> younger.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.268
I thought you were dating Linda.

16:00.352 --> 16:01.937
No, she's not pregnant right now.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.651
Hey, I know it's late. I was just
wondering if we could talk for a second?

16:07.735 --> 16:09.737
Yeah, no problem.
Colt, go inside.

16:11.697 --> 16:13.657
- Rooster.
- Fine.

16:13.741 --> 16:16.994
Abby, don't tell Colt about you and I...

16:17.077 --> 16:19.412
You know, 'cause he gets all...

16:22.290 --> 16:23.459
What are you talking about?

16:23.542 --> 16:25.335
Perfect.

16:27.546 --> 16:29.256
Let's go over and talk by the truck.

16:29.339 --> 16:31.967
We gotta keep it down unless
you wanna clean up stalls tonight.

16:32.050 --> 16:35.220
Oh, sorry, your dad's asleep?

16:35.303 --> 16:36.639
How's he doing, by the way?

16:36.722 --> 16:40.225
Oh, he's good.
Told me to tell you to shut the hell up.

16:42.811 --> 16:44.730
Wait, he yelled at me?

16:44.813 --> 16:47.274
Aw, he must still like me.

16:48.191 --> 16:49.401
Yeah.

16:49.485 --> 16:51.612
- You still got the old truck.
- Mmm.

16:51.695 --> 16:53.280
We had our first date in this truck.

16:53.363 --> 16:55.991
Yep. And we went to our first concert.

16:56.074 --> 16:57.951
Billy Ray Cyrus.

16:58.035 --> 17:00.538
The guy you called
the next Johnny Cash.

17:02.915 --> 17:05.667
Hey, look, that ain't my fault.
He cut off his mullet.

17:05.751 --> 17:07.335
His power was in his mullet.

17:11.674 --> 17:12.675
Yeah.

17:13.717 --> 17:16.804
- A lot of firsts in this truck.
- All right, take it easy.

17:16.887 --> 17:18.513
Well, I was gonna say
the first drive-in movie.

17:18.597 --> 17:20.265
Get your mind out of the gutter, woman.

17:22.099 --> 17:25.186
Look, Colt,
I'm sorry if I made tonight awkward.

17:26.188 --> 17:29.357
Awkward? Come on,
I never even gave it another thought.

17:29.441 --> 17:32.069
Well, it's not like I went
and dug my yearbook up

17:32.152 --> 17:33.696
to see what this guy looked like.

17:33.779 --> 17:36.156
So, what, do you guys
just hang out together,

17:36.239 --> 17:38.200
playing chess and talking French?

17:40.118 --> 17:41.995
I mean, you coulda
just stalked him on Facebook,

17:42.079 --> 17:45.082
like I did your last girlfriend,
Jenny Roberts.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.794
- Hmm.
- Her 18th birthday looked really fun.

17:53.632 --> 17:56.426
Yeah, that was a surprise for both of us.

18:03.475 --> 18:06.061
Hey, uh, why'd you come
all the way out here?

18:07.813 --> 18:09.607
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

18:11.984 --> 18:16.739
You coulda just called.
But instead, you drove 15 miles...

18:17.740 --> 18:20.701
all the way out here,
in the middle of the night,

18:20.784 --> 18:23.245
without your boyfriend...

18:23.912 --> 18:25.748
just to see if I was okay.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.126
Come on.

18:30.043 --> 18:33.463
First of all...

18:34.673 --> 18:37.843
Kenny is on his way
to a mini-fridge expo in Boulder.

18:40.679 --> 18:42.347
And second...

18:43.932 --> 18:46.685
I felt like I wanted
to tell you in person that...

18:46.769 --> 18:48.145
Kenny and I are in love.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.190
Oh.

18:52.274 --> 18:54.610
And since we're going to be
seeing a lot of each other,

18:54.693 --> 18:58.155
- I want to make sure it's not weird.
- Yeah, yeah. Uh...

19:02.117 --> 19:04.577
Uh, I got to be honest, that is...

19:05.328 --> 19:06.914
That's not the answer I was expecting.

19:06.997 --> 19:07.998
Um...

19:10.375 --> 19:12.294
Yeah, you know...
No, it won't be weird,

19:12.377 --> 19:15.172
I promise when I run into you guys
in the future,

19:15.255 --> 19:19.384
I will treat Kenny with hospitality.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.056
And management.

19:26.391 --> 19:27.726
- Good.
- Good.

19:27.810 --> 19:30.103
- So it won't be awkward anymore?
- No, it won't.

19:30.187 --> 19:32.773
That's...
No more awkwardness.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.403
After now.

19:38.486 --> 19:40.113
- Uh...
- Yeah, I gotta get going.

19:40.197 --> 19:43.241
- I got a 7:00 a.m. detention.
- Detention? Wow!

19:44.159 --> 19:47.454
I think I stopped calling it "detention"
and started calling it "homeroom."

19:47.537 --> 19:49.622
Yeah.

19:51.499 --> 19:52.500
Oh.

19:53.418 --> 19:54.502
I remember this.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.386
Good to see you, Colt.

20:04.387 --> 20:05.889
Yeah, you too, Abby.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.695
Wanna do a little more bonding?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.655
I do.

20:24.616 --> 20:26.910
Last time I saw that truck...

20:26.994 --> 20:29.079
me and her were in the back of it
making little Roosters.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.836
Let's see you make little Roosters now.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.177
What the hell are you doing?

20:46.054 --> 20:49.266
Based on your tone,
something that pisses you off.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.561
You know, when I was your age,
you broke a tool,

20:53.645 --> 20:57.190
you had to craft a new one
with your own bare hands.

20:58.441 --> 21:00.360
Yeah, I'm gonna have to call BS
on that one.

21:02.404 --> 21:06.074
What gave it away?
The smile on my face?

21:09.036 --> 21:11.121
I know, I'm sorry I'm late.

21:11.204 --> 21:13.623
Yeah, it's no big deal.
We're all done here.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.625
Yeah, it's just,
I didn't hear the alarm, so...

21:15.708 --> 21:18.211
Oh, I did. I came in there
and turned it off for you.

21:18.921 --> 21:22.049
Hey, by the way,
how'd your toothbrush taste this morning?

21:22.132 --> 21:24.802
Man, come on, not today.

21:26.344 --> 21:28.305
Look, Dad, I'm really sorry.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.724
It's all right, Colt.
I wasn't counting on you anyway.

21:32.350 --> 21:33.685
No, you don't understand.

21:33.769 --> 21:35.979
Abby came last night
and it really screwed me up, so...

21:36.063 --> 21:39.149
Ah, there it is.
There's always an excuse.

21:39.232 --> 21:42.485
This time it's a girl.
What's it gonna be next time?

21:42.569 --> 21:45.238
I knew you were gonna pull this crap.
You always do.

21:46.698 --> 21:48.241
Dad, I'm here, okay?

21:48.325 --> 21:50.327
I'm ready to work.
Just tell me what to do.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.334
Here's the only thing I trust you with.

21:58.335 --> 21:59.461
Get me some coffee.

22:00.796 --> 22:02.547
You're kidding, right?

22:03.173 --> 22:04.716
You don't know how to make coffee?

22:04.800 --> 22:08.761
Uh, look, I don't mind mucking stalls
or carrying wood or riding fence,

22:08.846 --> 22:10.513
but I'm not gonna be your servant.

22:11.139 --> 22:14.309
If you don't want to do the things
I ask you to do...

22:14.392 --> 22:15.936
then I don't need you on this ranch.

22:16.019 --> 22:19.189
- I'm not gonna get you coffee!
- Then get the hell out of here.

22:20.899 --> 22:25.195
I'm just gonna remove this here
potential murder weapon up out of the way.

22:26.571 --> 22:28.823
- Fine.
- Fine.

22:29.992 --> 22:31.368
I'm out of here then.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.751
You know what I'm gonna do?

22:39.834 --> 22:41.711
I'm gonna go get you that coffee.

22:43.005 --> 22:44.631
I love you, Daddy.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.845
Give me a break, you know?

22:50.929 --> 22:52.973
It's just Dad. I mean, you know,
he gets pissed at everything.

22:53.056 --> 22:55.683
Yeah, I know. I remember the Halloween
when the kid came to the door

22:55.767 --> 22:58.603
and said, "Trick or treat,"
and Dad said, "Smith or Wesson."

23:00.272 --> 23:01.648
It's different with me and him.

23:02.274 --> 23:04.359
Yeah, all right, he's tough on you.

23:04.859 --> 23:06.194
Well, guess what,
he's tough on me, too.

23:06.278 --> 23:07.654
Well, then come with me.

23:07.737 --> 23:10.532
I'm sure I can get us a great rate
at a Marriott in Omaha.

23:11.408 --> 23:13.160
Oh, yeah, that's a...
that's a great idea.

23:13.243 --> 23:14.286
You know, we'll both bail.

23:14.369 --> 23:16.704
Dad will lose the ranch,
but we can always come back here and visit

23:16.788 --> 23:18.415
when this place turns into an Applebee's.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.042
Then stay!

23:20.125 --> 23:22.127
You know, we're all playing our roles.

23:22.210 --> 23:23.711
You're the good son.

23:23.795 --> 23:25.172
I'm leaving.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.468
Man... things were
just getting great here.

23:30.552 --> 23:33.055
Great here?
What is great about this?

23:33.138 --> 23:34.264
Remember last night,

23:34.347 --> 23:36.558
you were having girl problems,
I was making fun of you?

23:36.641 --> 23:37.935
That was awesome!

23:38.018 --> 23:39.811
No, it wasn't!

23:39.894 --> 23:42.897
'Cause I still don't know whether or not
you had sex with my ex-girlfriend.

23:42.981 --> 23:45.442
Let's not get caught up
in all that kind of stuff.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.609
Hey!

23:47.444 --> 23:50.155
Look, man,
you're my little brother, okay?

23:50.238 --> 23:51.656
I don't want to lose you again.

23:55.493 --> 23:56.661
Sorry.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.500
What the hell are you doing, man?

24:02.584 --> 24:05.128
If you leave now,
Dad is not letting you back in here.

24:05.212 --> 24:06.213
Get off of me!

24:07.339 --> 24:09.882
You're not leaving!

24:18.516 --> 24:21.186
Hey, after dinner,
you wanna watch something?

24:21.269 --> 24:22.354
Like what?

24:22.437 --> 24:24.939
I don't know.
Something on Netflix?

24:25.940 --> 24:28.110
What the fuck is Netflix?

24:32.197 --> 24:33.490
Never mind.

24:35.533 --> 24:37.035
I heard a good joke today. So...

24:38.495 --> 24:40.372
a horse walks into a bar, right?

24:40.455 --> 24:42.624
Why would a horse walk into a bar?

24:44.251 --> 24:45.335
To get a drink.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.464
It's a horse.
He'd drink outside in a trough.

24:50.548 --> 24:52.634
Well, this horse
wanted something stronger.

24:53.676 --> 24:55.387
Horses don't drink alcohol.

24:55.470 --> 24:56.638
This one does.

24:58.140 --> 25:01.934
And no one else in the bar is reacting
to the fact that a horse walked in?

25:02.810 --> 25:04.646
Yeah.

25:04.729 --> 25:06.731
All right, yeah,
a couple of people react.

25:06.814 --> 25:08.900
They're real surprised,
but then they get over it.

25:10.443 --> 25:12.070
So...

25:13.155 --> 25:14.906
the horse walks up
to the bartender and says,

25:14.989 --> 25:17.200
- "Hey, I would like a Jack and Coke."
- Wait.

25:17.284 --> 25:18.493
Now the horse can talk?

25:25.083 --> 25:26.376
Can I just finish my joke?

25:28.336 --> 25:30.880
- Let me tell you one.
- Go ahead.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.549
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.051
- Do the dishes.
- Funny.

25:38.888 --> 25:40.848
You better hide your toothbrush tonight.

25:44.519 --> 25:47.230
You know...

25:47.314 --> 25:51.109
Maybe it's none of my business,
but weren't you a little hard on Colt?

25:53.695 --> 25:54.696
You're right.

25:55.738 --> 25:58.075
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

25:58.158 --> 25:59.992
It's none of your business.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.205
You know, he's just like you.

26:03.288 --> 26:05.039
He is nothing like me.

26:05.748 --> 26:08.000
Only reason this whole thing blew up?

26:08.085 --> 26:10.462
'Cause you're both too stubborn
to admit it's either one of your fault.

26:10.545 --> 26:12.589
That is absolutely not true.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.882
Okay.

26:14.966 --> 26:16.551
Let me ask you something.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.846
What would happen to this place if I died?

26:21.431 --> 26:23.225
After the party?

26:25.893 --> 26:27.687
I mean, obviously, I would run it.

26:28.188 --> 26:29.481
What if we both died?

26:29.564 --> 26:32.692
What's happening here? Is this,
like, a murder-suicide kind of thing?

26:34.986 --> 26:39.991
Colt would sell all the livestock,
sell the ranch, piss the money away,

26:40.074 --> 26:42.244
and no good would ever come of it.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.662
Well, that's not true.

26:44.746 --> 26:47.332
A lot of strippers in Denver
would get new boobies.

26:52.629 --> 26:54.922
Your brother is a 34-year-old child.

26:56.341 --> 27:00.178
I'm just trying to prepare him
for the rest of his life.

27:00.928 --> 27:04.182
If that means I have to push him,
so be it.

27:04.849 --> 27:07.560
Well, you pushed him all right.

27:07.644 --> 27:09.729
Pushed him right out the door.

27:09.812 --> 27:13.275
Congratulations, Pop. You win.

27:17.404 --> 27:19.406
You ever think about
getting a bigger place, Mom?

27:19.989 --> 27:21.783
Why? I like it here.

27:21.866 --> 27:25.328
You know, I've found that
the happier you are, the less you need.

27:26.996 --> 27:29.832
Your father has a 1,500-acre ranch.

27:31.168 --> 27:34.003
You know, I think Dad
needs another 1,500 acres.

27:35.880 --> 27:39.133
What about you, Colt?
What'll it take to make you happy?

27:39.217 --> 27:41.886
Oh... I don't know.

27:41.969 --> 27:44.556
Old whiskey and young blondes.

27:44.639 --> 27:48.226
If it's closing time,
young whiskey and old blondes.

27:48.768 --> 27:52.730
Dodging the deep questions,
a long-standing Bennett tradition.

27:52.814 --> 27:54.357
Well, what do you want me to say?

27:54.441 --> 27:57.277
I know I don't like taking crap from Dad.
That don't make me happy.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.946
Well, no one said working with him
was gonna be easy.

28:01.906 --> 28:05.910
Yeah, well, I don't mind doing
the grunt work and being the beaver,

28:05.993 --> 28:07.454
but I ain't gonna be his servant.

28:09.038 --> 28:12.083
Well, you know,
you've gotta understand that Dad's...

28:12.166 --> 28:16.379
He's in free fall now 'cause of the ranch.
He's in crisis mode.

28:16.463 --> 28:19.841
And...
did you just call yourself a beaver?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.760
It's a totem pole thing.

28:22.844 --> 28:25.972
And by the way, the bottom of
the totem pole is the most important part,

28:26.055 --> 28:27.890
'cause it holds up the whole pole.
It's all about the base.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.435
- It's like that song.
- Okay, wait. Focus, honey.

28:30.518 --> 28:33.313
Focus on what?
The fact that Dad is impossible?

28:33.396 --> 28:35.690
I'm... I'm sure your dad
is being unfair, all right?

28:35.773 --> 28:38.568
Because, you know,
your dad can be unfair.

28:38.651 --> 28:40.612
But you have a part in this, too.

28:41.488 --> 28:45.116
You know, when the going gets tough,
you have a tendency to run.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.868
No, I don't.

28:47.369 --> 28:48.870
You're sitting on a suitcase, son.

28:50.455 --> 28:52.540
All right, but you got this one wrong, Ma.

28:52.624 --> 28:53.750
- This is totally different.
- Okay.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.211
I mean, he's got it out for me.
That's what it is.

28:56.294 --> 28:59.464
Oh, so there's absolutely no way
that I'm right?

28:59.547 --> 29:00.840
No.

29:00.923 --> 29:03.843
Right, you're dead certain you're right
and won't listen to reason.

29:03.926 --> 29:06.178
Huh!
You're just like him.

29:06.929 --> 29:10.392
He's a stubborn, temperamental asshole!

29:11.226 --> 29:12.352
So we agree.

29:47.970 --> 29:51.057
- Morning.
- We got a lot of work to do today.

29:51.140 --> 29:53.351
Oh, I slept fine, thanks.
How about you?

29:54.644 --> 29:55.895
Whoa.

29:56.813 --> 29:59.566
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

30:00.608 --> 30:03.570
I know you got a busy day.
I made you breakfast sandwiches.

30:04.362 --> 30:07.407
Oh... nice. Ham and Swiss.

30:08.408 --> 30:11.494
For future reference,
the rooster likes provolone.

30:13.996 --> 30:17.709
Come on, we got that 20 pair
to move to the south pasture.

30:17.792 --> 30:20.002
Oh, hey, hang on.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.796
Made you coffee.

30:26.884 --> 30:27.969
Thanks.

30:32.349 --> 30:33.600
You comin' or what?

30:41.441 --> 30:44.611
- Hey, you wanna hear a joke?
- No.

30:45.987 --> 30:48.406
Hey. A horse walks into a bar.

30:49.031 --> 30:51.283
Why would a horse walk into a bar?

30:53.160 --> 30:55.913
You think that's bad, it talks, too.

30:57.999 --> 31:00.543
Man, I'm glad you're back.

31:00.627 --> 31:02.128
Thanks.
