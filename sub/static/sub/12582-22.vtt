Joseph, meeting girls
is about to get a whole lot easier.

00:37.721 --> 00:40.087
They've all got to go to
the bathroom sometime,

00:40.123 --> 00:42.455
and now they'll have
to go right by us.

00:42.492 --> 00:44.551
Tell me honestly,
is this hat cool?

00:44.594 --> 00:46.027
My dad says it's cool.

00:46.062 --> 00:47.359
Is it cool?

00:52.602 --> 00:57.130
So, what brings
you ladies here today, hmm?

01:01.511 --> 01:04.001
We're not coming out
until you leave!

01:05.648 --> 01:07.138
As most of you know,

01:07.183 --> 01:09.083
next quarter will be
the first time

01:09.119 --> 01:10.518
you get to take electives.

01:10.553 --> 01:12.987
Electives are classes
that you elect to take

01:13.022 --> 01:14.785
and you are not forced to take.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.122
I elect to take...

01:17.160 --> 01:19.219
Nothing!

01:19.262 --> 01:23.289
Man, Alejandro is so smooth.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.665
Hey, this might be
just what we need.

01:25.702 --> 01:26.862
Think about it.

01:26.903 --> 01:29.269
Why do guys like us
keep striking out

01:29.305 --> 01:30.704
with the ladies?

01:30.740 --> 01:31.900
Because I'm weird,

01:31.941 --> 01:33.431
and you're chubby
and kind of dumb?

01:33.476 --> 01:35.103
Don't be ridiculous.

01:35.145 --> 01:37.613
It's because we've had
the same girls

01:37.647 --> 01:40.480
in the same classes
since the first grade.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.111
Every girl here has heard
all my jokes

01:43.153 --> 01:45.348
and remembers
you pooting during

01:45.388 --> 01:47.856
the racial tolerance assembly.

01:47.891 --> 01:50.826
What we need to do is find
a class with a lot of girls.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.351
Girls that don't
know us very well.

01:53.396 --> 01:55.796
Yeah. We could pretend
we're from the future...

01:55.832 --> 01:58.266
: And we need
to experiment on them.

01:58.301 --> 02:00.496
Wait, this is why girls
don't like me, right?

02:02.172 --> 02:04.163
<i>Hey, Dad,</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:05.674
what elective should I take,

02:05.708 --> 02:08.404
Peer Counseling
or Hawaiian dance?

02:08.443 --> 02:09.705
Oh, who am I kidding?

02:09.746 --> 02:13.682
I humbly offer taro
to your village.

02:13.716 --> 02:14.705
Peggy, the boy.

02:14.751 --> 02:16.309
Bobby, honey, not now!

02:16.352 --> 02:17.580
What are we talking about?

02:17.620 --> 02:19.986
Okay, I'll take
peer counseling.

02:20.023 --> 02:22.218
"The peer counseling program

02:22.258 --> 02:25.159
is a way for teens
to help teens or..."

02:25.195 --> 02:29.598
heh, <i>"tweens</i> in the complicated
world they find themselves,

02:29.632 --> 02:33.568
through one-on-one dialogs
and active listening."

02:33.603 --> 02:34.695
Oh, God.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.796
It's all about
when kids have problems,

02:36.840 --> 02:38.740
they talk them out
with other kids.

02:38.775 --> 02:41.107
Bobby, no good
ever came from kids

02:41.144 --> 02:43.510
talking to other kids
about their problems.

02:43.546 --> 02:45.878
Sweet, Lord, they've
got auto shop,

02:45.915 --> 02:47.542
in middle school!

02:47.584 --> 02:48.846
Done deal.

02:48.885 --> 02:50.819
But I want to meet girls.

02:50.854 --> 02:53.084
I don't think there
are girls in auto shop.

02:53.122 --> 02:55.682
You've got to think
long term, Bobby.

02:55.725 --> 02:57.716
Auto shop is where
boys become the men

02:57.760 --> 03:00.092
that girls will want
when they become women.

03:00.129 --> 03:01.494
It worked for me.

03:01.531 --> 03:02.930
The proof is in the pudding,

03:02.966 --> 03:04.490
and I am that pudding.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.832
So Bobby is taking auto shop.

03:09.873 --> 03:11.966
That is so great! Wingo!
Good for you, man.

03:12.008 --> 03:14.442
Yep, I'll buy him
an old junker car,

03:14.477 --> 03:16.377
then we can
restore it together.

03:16.412 --> 03:18.380
We'll stay up late
fixing her up,

03:18.414 --> 03:19.881
just me and my boy.

03:19.916 --> 03:21.781
Then one day
when we're all finished,

03:21.818 --> 03:24.446
Bobby'll get in that car
and he'll drive away,

03:24.487 --> 03:27.422
and then I can die a happy man.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.152
Yep.

03:29.192 --> 03:30.318
Mm, yep.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.486
Mm-hmm.

03:31.527 --> 03:34.792
That's actually
kind of sad, Hank.

03:38.401 --> 03:41.029
Auto shop! Auto shop!

03:41.070 --> 03:43.163
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

03:43.206 --> 03:45.572
No, but my dad says
it's one of those things

03:45.608 --> 03:47.269
that'll make sense later.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.437
I'm getting tired
of those things.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.741
Ribs!

03:53.149 --> 03:54.912
Hey, Bobby!

04:01.357 --> 04:03.120
What class is this?

04:03.159 --> 04:04.148
Chick class?

04:04.193 --> 04:05.751
It's Peer Counseling.

04:05.795 --> 04:07.285
I read a story on the Internet

04:07.330 --> 04:09.161
that started just like this.

04:09.198 --> 04:11.359
It ended nicely.

04:13.403 --> 04:14.335
Give me a minute.

04:14.370 --> 04:15.496
Give me a minute.

04:15.538 --> 04:18.974
My dad might be wrong
on this one.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.976
Isn't your dad gonna be mad?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.705
Oh, it's football season.

04:22.745 --> 04:24.474
I'm <i>way</i> off his radar.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.210
Hi. I'm April,
class advisor.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.684
It's going to be great
to have some boys on staff.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.118
In case any guys ever decide

04:31.154 --> 04:32.621
to admit they have feelings.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.953
I'm having all kinds
of feelings right now.

04:34.991 --> 04:37.118
Leave. Now.
The both of you.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.685
I am shocked at your behavior!

04:39.729 --> 04:43.358
Can't you see
we are here to heal?

04:45.902 --> 04:49.338
Uh, uh, oh, man, gir... uh...

04:49.372 --> 04:50.600
Dang.

04:56.245 --> 04:58.076
It's false advertising.

04:58.114 --> 05:00.048
This car was supposed
to be a junker,

05:00.083 --> 05:02.347
but it's in moderate
to good condition.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.683
The problem is,
all our used cars

05:04.721 --> 05:07.952
now decorate Hard Rock Cafes.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.025
Oh, you boys must be here

05:13.062 --> 05:15.155
about my car.

05:15.198 --> 05:17.029
Oh, uh,

05:17.066 --> 05:19.796
I'm looking for something that needs
a little more work.

05:19.836 --> 05:23.294
Sorry to, uh,
make you... stand.

05:25.942 --> 05:27.341
Oh, God, she's
still coming at us.

05:27.377 --> 05:28.503
Run!

05:36.953 --> 05:39.683
Okay, who could tell me
some major issues

05:39.722 --> 05:41.349
affecting kids your age?

05:41.391 --> 05:42.449
Depression!

05:42.492 --> 05:43.652
Drugs and alcohol!

05:43.693 --> 05:45.786
They took away
our vending machines!

05:45.828 --> 05:48.228
That was off the hook, you guys!

05:48.264 --> 05:49.629
Off the hook!

05:49.665 --> 05:52.031
Now, the most important rule
to remember is

05:52.068 --> 05:55.094
that you can't give any advice
to your patients, okay?

05:55.138 --> 05:57.470
Great. So if we're
all clear on that,

05:57.507 --> 06:01.307
let's try
an active listening exercise.

06:01.344 --> 06:04.142
Hi. My name is
Mary Seventh Grader,

06:04.180 --> 06:05.875
and I feel bad
about the body images

06:05.915 --> 06:09.146
presented by television
and magazines.

06:09.185 --> 06:10.550
Amazing!

06:10.586 --> 06:13.646
This face says I care.

06:13.689 --> 06:14.986
I'm listening.

06:15.024 --> 06:18.289
I can help you
without giving any advice.

06:18.327 --> 06:20.727
Now, here are your clients.

06:20.763 --> 06:22.731
Jenny Medina is on this list!

06:22.765 --> 06:24.824
I've always wanted
to go out with her.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.027
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bobby.

06:26.069 --> 06:28.196
Jenny Medina
is off-limits.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.603
So are all the other
student-slash-clients.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.937
Yeah, right.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.568
April, Connie here
is under the impression

06:34.610 --> 06:36.942
that we're not allowed
to date our clients.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.674
Is that true?

06:38.714 --> 06:40.181
It's absolutely true.

06:40.216 --> 06:44.380
But what if a client
really, really likes you

06:44.420 --> 06:46.149
and you really,
really like her,

06:46.189 --> 06:48.589
and you both agree
to be cool about it?

06:48.624 --> 06:50.023
These girls are vulnerable,

06:50.059 --> 06:51.890
and you're in a
position of power.

06:51.928 --> 06:54.192
You don't want to take
advantage of that.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.026
Do you?

06:55.064 --> 06:56.463
Well...

06:56.499 --> 06:58.558
What about the other counselors?

06:58.601 --> 07:00.000
Can I date them?

07:00.036 --> 07:02.004
No clients, no counselors.

07:02.038 --> 07:03.528
Are we clear on that,
everybody?

07:03.573 --> 07:05.973
Nobody can date
anybody they meet here.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.403
Okay, now, group hug.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.273
Oh, Bobby,

07:13.316 --> 07:15.250
maybe you should hug yourself.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.554
So, you can't date
any of them?

07:24.594 --> 07:26.425
No.

07:26.462 --> 07:29.363
Maybe I could still get
into Hawaiian dance.

07:29.398 --> 07:33.391
Apparently their culture
appreciates people my size.

07:33.436 --> 07:34.562
It's closed out.

07:34.604 --> 07:36.435
You're gonna end up
in metal shop with me.

07:36.472 --> 07:37.598
Like this!

07:37.640 --> 07:39.039
It sucks.

07:39.075 --> 07:41.373
It's all full of dudes
and sharp things.

07:42.645 --> 07:45.079
I guess I'll just
have to <i>help</i> people.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.252
Bobby, Jenny Medina is here.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.450
I'll send her back.

07:55.491 --> 07:57.925
Oh, my God, Jenny Medina!

08:09.805 --> 08:12.205
Aren't you supposed
to say something or something?

08:12.241 --> 08:15.540
I think <i>you're</i> supposed to
say something or something.

08:17.113 --> 08:19.843
Okay, so I got invited to Debbie
Reid's slumber party, right?

08:19.882 --> 08:22.373
I mean, like, so what?
I fell asleep first, and then

08:22.418 --> 08:24.613
I woke up with my hand
in a bowl of hot water.

08:24.654 --> 08:26.246
Do you think
I should tell people

08:26.289 --> 08:27.984
that her father's an alcoholic?

08:30.960 --> 08:34.191
Oh, I'm sorry,
I can only, um, listen,

08:34.230 --> 08:36.289
and not tell you what to do.

08:36.332 --> 08:39.267
I think I'm gonna tell people
her father's an alcoholic.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.001
Wow, I feel kind of better.

08:42.038 --> 08:43.471
Can I make
another appointment?

08:43.506 --> 08:45.133
Really? With me?

08:45.174 --> 08:47.142
Yeah.

08:50.379 --> 08:52.904
Bobby Medina.

08:56.152 --> 08:59.485
Aren't you the kid they had to cut out
of the soccer net?

08:59.522 --> 09:00.853
Uh...

09:00.890 --> 09:03.324
I have to debate
capital punishment next period,

09:03.359 --> 09:05.884
but I totally don't care...
should I ditch?

09:05.928 --> 09:08.021
I can't tell you what to do.

09:08.064 --> 09:11.158
Only <i>you</i> can tell <i>you</i>
what to do.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.566
If I knew what to do,
I wouldn't be here!

09:13.603 --> 09:15.093
Now, tell me what to do!

09:15.137 --> 09:16.502
Uh, ditch!

09:16.539 --> 09:18.302
If you say so.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.038
Hey, Bobby!

09:25.081 --> 09:26.981
You were so right.

09:27.016 --> 09:28.244
I was?

09:28.284 --> 09:30.718
I ditched... and it
felt so good to ditch,

09:30.753 --> 09:32.220
I ditched the whole day.

09:32.255 --> 09:33.813
Hey, I might ditch tomorrow.

09:33.856 --> 09:36.347
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

09:36.392 --> 09:37.791
Fight! Fight!

09:37.827 --> 09:39.488
Bobby, do something!

09:42.398 --> 09:45.731
Dooley, I don't think you want
to beat up Randy.

09:45.768 --> 09:49.829
I think you just want
someone to notice your new shoes.

09:49.872 --> 09:51.339
They are pretty nice.

09:51.374 --> 09:52.841
They're new.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.173
Don't you want
to let him go? 're new.

10:02.885 --> 10:05.945
Bobby, you saved Randy's life.

10:05.988 --> 10:07.751
I <i>did</i>.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.348
These hands.

10:09.392 --> 10:11.223
This brain.

10:11.260 --> 10:14.024
I have the gift.

10:14.063 --> 10:15.928
Dang ol' axle's busted.

10:15.965 --> 10:17.694
Ol' engine's cracked too, man.

10:17.733 --> 10:19.394
That ol' head gasket blown,

10:19.435 --> 10:21.596
and dang ol' just
a piece of junk, man.

10:21.637 --> 10:23.161
It doesn't even have wheels.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.298
Is this even a vehicle?

10:25.341 --> 10:27.901
We've found Bobby's car.

10:30.513 --> 10:32.378
You should've seen
me with Dooley,

10:32.415 --> 10:34.781
taking charge,
setting him straight.

10:34.817 --> 10:37.843
You know, when I was just
doing the listening thing,

10:37.887 --> 10:41.323
I was pretty good,
but now that I'm giving advice,

10:41.357 --> 10:43.484
I'm changing lives.

10:43.526 --> 10:46.086
Bobby, you're not supposed
to give advice.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.925
Connie, you must be so tired

10:47.963 --> 10:50.796
of having to follow
the rules all the time.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.801
But I know why you do it.

10:52.835 --> 10:56.464
You want your father to love you like
the son he <i>really</i> wanted.

10:56.505 --> 11:00.999
But you can only
be who you are.

11:01.043 --> 11:02.704
Yeah, I know.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.770
I can't turn this off!

11:06.549 --> 11:08.107
Well, I can't wait to see

11:08.150 --> 11:09.640
the look on Bobby's face

11:09.685 --> 11:11.118
when he sees this baby.

11:11.153 --> 11:12.620
Nobody touches it.

11:12.655 --> 11:14.987
Can I just replace
the sump gasket?

11:15.024 --> 11:16.150
It's right there,

11:16.192 --> 11:17.716
and I'm right here.
No.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.193
Man, just let me
dang ol' tighten

11:19.228 --> 11:21.093
that dang 'ol needle
bearing right there.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.097
No.
Damn it, Hank.

11:22.131 --> 11:24.031
Can we at least
pick the flowers

11:24.066 --> 11:25.556
in the manifold?
No.

11:25.601 --> 11:28.934
This is Bobby's car and he's
gonna be the one to fix it.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.439
Here's the thing:

11:38.481 --> 11:40.676
Problems don't take
the weekend off

11:40.716 --> 11:42.274
and neither should I.

11:42.318 --> 11:44.980
So, if you wanted to
talk on Saturday night,

11:45.020 --> 11:48.854
say, at the movies, I'd be
happy to clear my schedule.

11:48.891 --> 11:50.859
Do you mean like a date?

11:50.893 --> 11:54.795
Well, sometimes putting a
label on things is helpful.

11:54.830 --> 11:58.027
So, if you're more comfortable
with terms like "dating"

11:58.067 --> 12:01.195
and "boyfriend"
or"making out,"

12:01.237 --> 12:03.569
well, you're the patient.

12:08.411 --> 12:10.402
Bobby, I've got a problem.

12:10.446 --> 12:13.643
You know, I was just
thinking about the brain.

12:13.682 --> 12:15.206
Fascinating organ.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.741
It's your biggest organ.

12:16.786 --> 12:17.946
Did you know that?

12:17.987 --> 12:20.114
Um, I think it's your skin.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.624
Well, maybe that's
one of your problems.

12:22.658 --> 12:26.059
You don't give your brain
the respect it deserves.

12:26.095 --> 12:28.461
Wow. That's deep.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.055
It really is.

12:30.099 --> 12:33.091
Okay, so the problem
is my boyfriend.

12:33.135 --> 12:35.831
Boyfriend issues. Juicy.

12:35.871 --> 12:37.702
You need to dump his ass!

12:37.740 --> 12:40.402
But I didn't even tell you
about my problems yet.

12:40.443 --> 12:41.967
He doesn't call enough.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.672
He won't read your notes.

12:43.712 --> 12:47.443
It all comes down to "he doesn't
think you're all that."

12:47.483 --> 12:49.075
And you <i>are,</i> Stacey.

12:49.118 --> 12:50.915
Thanks, Bobby.

12:50.953 --> 12:53.353
So you really think
I'm really "all that"?

12:53.389 --> 12:55.220
Yeah, sure, why not?

12:55.257 --> 12:58.124
Now, back to my brain.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.355
Hey, Dad, I...

13:02.398 --> 13:04.059
What the heck is that?

13:04.099 --> 13:07.466
I didn't know if you were
a Ford man or a Chevy man.

13:07.503 --> 13:10.438
It was the happiest problem
I've ever faced.

13:13.142 --> 13:15.133
You bought me a car?
Yep.

13:15.177 --> 13:17.805
Now, let's put that auto-shop
training to work!

13:17.847 --> 13:19.747
What tool can I get for you?

13:19.782 --> 13:21.977
A... hammer.

13:22.017 --> 13:23.348
A hammer?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.353
Boy, have you been sleeping
through auto shop

13:25.387 --> 13:26.752
or are you being funny?

13:26.789 --> 13:30.623
Uh, you know, Dad, I think your
obsession with auto shop

13:30.659 --> 13:33.992
stems from your unresolved
feelings about your father.

13:34.029 --> 13:37.487
And, perhaps, we should explore
some of those feelings.

13:37.533 --> 13:40.661
Bobby, you know how I
"explore" my feelings?

13:40.703 --> 13:43.194
I fix my truck
or your mother's car.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.366
When Mr. Dauterive's wife
left him,

13:45.407 --> 13:46.897
we tuned up his Escort.

13:46.942 --> 13:50.036
And when that little fella
from the Fantasy Island died,

13:50.079 --> 13:52.138
we put the ant on top
of Dale's van.

13:52.181 --> 13:53.842
Well, that's one path.

13:53.883 --> 13:55.908
But if I took Peer Counseling,
I could...

13:55.951 --> 13:57.384
Trust me, Bobby,
when you're stuck

13:57.419 --> 13:59.387
on the side of the road
with your girlfriend,

13:59.421 --> 14:02.788
and you can do more than ask
your carburetor how it feels,

14:02.825 --> 14:04.520
you'll be glad
you took auto shop.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.551
Okay.

14:07.997 --> 14:10.397
...and that is why I like air.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.525
Okay, who's next?

14:12.568 --> 14:13.592
Stacey Gibson.

14:16.338 --> 14:18.272
I know all of you were expecting

14:18.307 --> 14:20.707
to hear my report
on the Desert Peccary,

14:20.743 --> 14:25.646
but I've decided to do my report
on another pig, Tony Hesperia,

14:25.681 --> 14:29.014
also known as
<i>Bastardis Boyfriendus</i>.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.319
She's my client.

14:32.354 --> 14:33.514
That's right, Tony.

14:33.556 --> 14:36.320
This relationship is extinct!

14:36.358 --> 14:38.826
But I'll be fine,

14:38.861 --> 14:40.852
because I've made
a new discovery...

14:40.896 --> 14:42.659
Good "I" statements.

14:42.698 --> 14:45.724
...Bobby Hill,
an <i>Awsomeus Guyis</i>.

14:47.069 --> 14:50.095
His characteristics are caring
and compassion.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.301
He's so sweet and loving,

14:53.342 --> 14:55.742
and he's always there for me
when I need him.

14:55.778 --> 14:57.939
You're there for people.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.882
Bobby, talking with you
has been the best thing

15:01.917 --> 15:04.385
in my whole entire life.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.546
This is for you.

15:06.622 --> 15:08.419
♪ If you wanna be with me ♪

15:08.457 --> 15:10.254
♪ Baby, you don't need to pay ♪

15:10.292 --> 15:12.590
♪ I'm your Stacey in a bottle ♪

15:12.628 --> 15:14.721
♪ You gotta rub me
the right way! ♪

15:14.763 --> 15:16.355
Let's not make a scene.

15:16.398 --> 15:19.799
B-o-b-b-y!
I ain't got no alibi!

15:19.835 --> 15:20.893
I love you!

16:16.258 --> 16:17.691
Hi, Bobby!

16:17.726 --> 16:19.091
I was thinking
about you at lunch,

16:19.128 --> 16:21.722
so I went home and I
burned you some mix CDs.

16:21.764 --> 16:23.425
I didn't know
if you had a player,

16:23.465 --> 16:24.796
so I bought you a Discman.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.164
Do you want to pick out
our song?

16:26.201 --> 16:29.830
It wouldn't be right
for me to accept the CDs.

16:29.872 --> 16:32.670
But maybe I can meet you
halfway and keep the Discman.

16:32.708 --> 16:33.800
Thanks.

16:33.842 --> 16:35.639
Hey, you know what I realized?

16:35.678 --> 16:37.703
We have, like,
no pictures together.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.611
You want to go to Sears,
geta bunch taken?

16:39.648 --> 16:42.583
Uh...
Stacey, here is the thing.

16:42.618 --> 16:46.315
As a counselor,
my ethics mean everything to me.

16:46.355 --> 16:49.085
And since I'm already
dating one of my clients...

16:49.124 --> 16:52.685
But... I broke up with Tony
to date you.

16:52.728 --> 16:55.026
I can't believe
you did this to me!

16:56.165 --> 17:00.101
I hear and respect your anger.

17:00.135 --> 17:02.433
This isn't over, Bobby!

17:05.808 --> 17:07.833
Bobby, you've got
a drop-in patient.

17:10.846 --> 17:12.074
Hey.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.445
Sometimes I have these
really weird urges

17:14.483 --> 17:16.713
to, like, burn stuff down.

17:16.752 --> 17:18.583
Now is not the time.

17:18.619 --> 17:22.715
I think Stacey Gibson
is stalking me.

17:22.758 --> 17:25.056
No way.
You've got a stalker?

17:25.094 --> 17:26.617
This is serious.

17:26.662 --> 17:28.391
You could probably
make out with her.

17:29.898 --> 17:32.196
Um, Stacey Gibson
is here to see you.

17:32.234 --> 17:33.360
Run.

17:33.402 --> 17:35.199
She's gonna
take me down with you.

17:39.174 --> 17:41.574
April, you gotta help me.

17:41.610 --> 17:44.135
I'm having problems
with one of my patients.

17:44.179 --> 17:45.441
It's an eating
disorder, right?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.278
Which way is it
going, in or out?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.750
No, it's just that
this one girl, Stacey,

17:49.785 --> 17:51.810
has gotten way
too attached to me.

17:51.854 --> 17:54.721
I've got a big date with
Jenny Medina Saturday night.

17:54.757 --> 17:57.385
I don't need this
hanging over my head.

17:57.426 --> 17:58.791
Wait, Jenny's a client.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.624
You're dating
one of your clients?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.527
I told you not to do that!

18:02.564 --> 18:04.725
Yeah, well, that cow's
out of the barn, April.

18:04.767 --> 18:05.961
You've got to help me.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.697
Listen, I already dinged
Principal Moss's car,

18:08.737 --> 18:10.432
I don't need this.

18:10.472 --> 18:12.736
You're on your own.

18:19.715 --> 18:21.546
Bobby.

18:21.583 --> 18:24.051
Oh, hey, Jenny.
I'm looking forward to...

18:24.086 --> 18:27.180
Bobby, people are saying that
you drove Stacey Gibson crazy.

18:27.222 --> 18:28.849
And I'm not looking for that
right now.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.923
Is everything okay, Bobby?

18:37.966 --> 18:40.025
You haven't even
touched your butter.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.468
What was that?

18:46.508 --> 18:48.442
Great dinner, Mom.

18:48.477 --> 18:50.707
Wow! What is this?

18:50.746 --> 18:52.873
Pepper? Delicious.

18:52.915 --> 18:55.509
Is that Dale throwing
eggs at our house again?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.542
No, it's a girl.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.383
That's one of my patients.

19:00.422 --> 19:03.220
Patients?
I didn't take Auto Shop, Dad.

19:03.258 --> 19:05.658
I took Peer Counseling instead.

19:05.694 --> 19:07.958
Oh, the hammer.

19:07.996 --> 19:10.430
Of course, I was so stupid.

19:10.465 --> 19:11.762
I'm sorry, Dad.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.597
I was counseling
this girl Stacey

19:13.635 --> 19:16.365
and I told her to dump
her boyfriend because he was...

19:16.405 --> 19:19.272
Well, I don't know
what he was, but now

19:19.308 --> 19:20.468
she's stalking me.

19:20.509 --> 19:22.841
Bobby, meet me in the garage.

19:22.878 --> 19:24.641
Excuse me, young lady?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.910
Hey. Nice shot.

19:26.949 --> 19:28.246
I'll do it again.

19:28.283 --> 19:30.342
Looks like you've got
a few more eggs there.

19:30.385 --> 19:32.046
Why don't you go
ahead and throw 'em,

19:32.087 --> 19:34.214
then when you're done,
come on into the garage.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.654
Stacey, here's a socket wrench.

19:41.697 --> 19:43.028
I'm going to ask you
to refrain

19:43.065 --> 19:45.295
from hitting Bobby with it.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.325
Take off that distributor cap.

19:47.369 --> 19:49.929
And, Bobby, find something metal
and tighten it.

19:53.342 --> 19:55.242
Just tell me, Bobby.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.541
Why do you like Jenny Medina
better than me?

19:57.579 --> 20:00.605
Well, I guess Jenny
validated me in certain...

20:00.649 --> 20:02.810
Bobby, I want you
to tighten that bolt.

20:02.851 --> 20:05.046
You're gonna need that wrench
Stacey's holding.

20:05.087 --> 20:08.887
Uh, Stacey, can I
borrow that wrench?

20:08.924 --> 20:09.948
I guess so.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.522
I'm sorry if I led you on,

20:14.563 --> 20:17.225
but I don't feel that way
about you.

20:17.266 --> 20:19.257
You're turning that
the wrong way, Bobby.

20:22.437 --> 20:24.234
You know, I think
I'm going to try

20:24.273 --> 20:25.831
to get back
together with Tony.

20:25.874 --> 20:28.104
That's probably a good idea.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.872
I was wondering, though,

20:29.912 --> 20:33.348
what was it about me that
you found so irresistible?

20:33.382 --> 20:36.351
I think it was the power.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.546
The power? That's it?

20:38.587 --> 20:40.316
I don't know what else
it could have been.

20:40.355 --> 20:42.016
Thanks, Mr. Hill.

20:42.057 --> 20:43.490
If you have any problems

20:43.525 --> 20:45.550
patching things up
with your boyfriend,

20:45.594 --> 20:47.858
we're rebuilding
the starter tomorrow.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.023
Now I've got nothing.

20:52.067 --> 20:54.228
I'm kicked out
of Peer Counseling.

20:54.269 --> 20:56.464
No girls. Nothing.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.904
You know what you've got?

20:57.940 --> 20:58.964
A car.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.872
As soon as we fix
this baby up,

21:00.909 --> 21:02.774
you'll be fighting 'em off
with a stick.

21:02.811 --> 21:05.302
Look, I took this off.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.212
Was it supposed to come off?

21:07.249 --> 21:08.876
No, son.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.852
But no girls have
to know that, right?

21:11.887 --> 21:14.082
It'll stay in the garage.
