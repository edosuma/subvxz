00:07.682 --> 00:09.785
- Okay, team, everyone has
scored a goal this season

00:09.885 --> 00:10.919
except for Tom.

00:11.019 --> 00:12.287
So let's try to pass to him.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.789
- Yeah, I'm better than I look,
guys.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.224
Nimble, strong, fast, agile,

00:16.291 --> 00:17.426
the whole--the whole package.

00:17.526 --> 00:18.794
- Oh, please, come on.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.562
Enough with this jibber-jabber
already.

00:20.629 --> 00:23.098
- Like I was saying, we're
here to support each other

00:23.198 --> 00:24.132
and have fun.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.634
- I think you all should know

00:25.734 --> 00:28.303
that my son should be
on the all-star team

00:28.403 --> 00:31.406
and not playing
with these bimbo nimrods.

00:31.473 --> 00:32.974
- Are we nimrods?
What's happening.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.042
- Lady, pipe down.

00:34.109 --> 00:35.210
You can say whatever you want

00:35.277 --> 00:36.711
about these other nimrods...

00:36.778 --> 00:38.146
- Let's be supportive.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.815
- But Tom is great
at everything he tires.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.116
- Yeah, I'm pretty solid.

00:41.216 --> 00:42.551
- Your son
is a failed bassoonist,

00:42.617 --> 00:45.787
and he crapped his pants
at Little League.

00:45.887 --> 00:47.289
- Coach, why don't we wrap up
the pep talk?

00:47.389 --> 00:49.591
This is really not--
not pepping us up.

- Ugh, that woman
is so annoying.

00:55.397 --> 00:58.233
She ruins every soccer game.
- I don't wish ill upon people,

00:58.300 --> 01:00.836
but I went to church last week
to pray that she dies.

01:02.237 --> 01:03.805
Hi, I know you're talking
about my wife.

01:03.905 --> 01:05.740
- Uh, no! Your wife?

01:05.807 --> 01:07.342
- Your wife is great.
- Love your wife.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.144
- We were talking
about a different wife.

01:09.244 --> 01:12.013
- There's no need to deny it.
I mean, she is a nightmare.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.516
Listen, can I show you guys
something over here?

01:14.616 --> 01:15.984
- Behind the dumpster?

01:17.853 --> 01:19.421
- Okay, I know what this is,
Nurse.

01:19.488 --> 01:21.323
This is a dumpster
blow job scenario.

01:21.423 --> 01:22.858
- Wh--
- Absolutely not.

01:22.958 --> 01:23.992
- Okay, forget I said it.

01:24.092 --> 01:25.260
What do you want to talk about?

01:25.327 --> 01:26.862
- Tell me if society

01:26.962 --> 01:28.697
would frown on something
like this

01:28.797 --> 01:30.532
and if this is inappropriate,

01:30.632 --> 01:33.702
but what if we slip her
some kind of sedative?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.036
- Wait, what?

01:35.137 --> 01:36.705
- I mean, is that wrong?
- Yes, it's wrong.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.206
I can't believe
you just said that.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.508
- Nurse, let's hear him out.

01:39.608 --> 01:41.143
- Are you listening
to yourselves?

01:41.209 --> 01:43.345
- I am listening, and I'm
hearing some stuff I like.

01:43.445 --> 01:45.147
What kind of sedative
are you thinking?

01:45.213 --> 01:47.282
- You know, mild.
Mild to heavy.

01:47.349 --> 01:49.050
- No!
- Okay, yeah!

01:49.151 --> 01:50.385
Mild to heavy sedatives.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.387
- No, no, no, no.
- You're the school nurse.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.723
So the whole thing would be
medically supervised.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.224
- I mean--

01:56.324 --> 01:57.893
- A lot of these drugs,
they're basically harmless.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.395
It's like drinking
a glass or two of chardonnay.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.064
-
- You gotta save the kids.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.333
- Who else,
if not the school nurse,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.503
will these children look up to
in life?

02:08.570 --> 02:10.005
- You know what?
Count me in.

02:10.071 --> 02:12.541
- All right!
- I feel good about this!

02:13.642 --> 02:15.544
- Here we go, guys! Yes!

02:15.644 --> 02:16.978
Good job!

02:17.045 --> 02:18.180
Come on, y'all!

02:18.246 --> 02:20.582
There it is!

02:20.682 --> 02:21.883
Whoo!

02:23.051 --> 02:24.419
That's it!

02:24.519 --> 02:25.754
That's what I'm talking about!

02:25.854 --> 02:27.088
That's what
I'm talking about!

02:27.189 --> 02:28.390
Good job.

02:28.490 --> 02:30.492
Come on, y'all!
- Hey, parents, uh-oh.

02:30.559 --> 02:33.428
What's this?
Free hot chocolates.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.331
- What a surprise!
- How unexpected.

02:36.398 --> 02:37.699
- Yeah, help yourselves,

02:37.766 --> 02:40.068
but the cups are
very specifically labeled,

02:40.168 --> 02:41.536
so no swapping.

02:41.603 --> 02:43.939
- Oh, no one's swapping
anything, Brad. Relax.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.911
- All you kids
are gonna have fun.

02:50.011 --> 02:51.446
Let's get Tom the ball.
- Oh, please.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.048
Leave mine here,
'cause I need to go talk

02:53.114 --> 02:56.051
to this jackass coach.
- Oh, no.

02:56.117 --> 02:57.619
- Sure, but keep an eye on it.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.221
I don't want anyone
swapping it.

02:59.287 --> 03:02.357
- Relax, you are such a weirdo.

03:03.191 --> 03:05.293
- Hey, we never formally met.
My name's Tom.

03:05.393 --> 03:08.396
- Shut up.
- Shut up? Okay, that's fine.

03:08.463 --> 03:10.065
All right, let's just get
this over with.

03:10.131 --> 03:11.800
- Look, if I pass it
to you today,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.568
it's because I believe in you.
- Thank you.

03:13.635 --> 03:15.971
- Not because Coach said,
"Pass it to the dud."

03:16.071 --> 03:17.639
- He calls me the dud
behind my back?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.808
- Nah, nobody calls you dud,
but even if they did,

03:19.908 --> 03:20.976
you're still our teammate,
you know,

03:21.076 --> 03:22.043
and we've got your back, so--

03:22.110 --> 03:23.378
- Why even bring it up?

03:23.445 --> 03:24.913
- I'm just saying
there's a possibility

03:24.980 --> 03:26.648
that throughout the game,
people are gonna be like,

03:26.748 --> 03:27.882
"Hey, pass it to the dud."

03:27.949 --> 03:29.618
You know, who cares?
- The dud?

03:29.718 --> 03:30.785
That's not even
a creative nickname.

03:30.885 --> 03:32.087
Come on, guys.

03:32.153 --> 03:33.622
All right,
I'll catch up in a minute.

03:33.722 --> 03:35.724
Free drinks, sweet.
- Oh, no, no, no.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.093
- Hey, Double D, want a drink?
Good energy boost.

03:38.159 --> 03:40.829
- Do not drink it.
I can't stress this enough.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.998
- Your wife is right.
You need to relax.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.833
All right,
let's play some soccer.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.134
- Oh, dear God.

03:46.234 --> 03:48.270
- All right, guys, yeah!

03:52.140 --> 03:54.776
Aw!
- Ah, I'm exhausted.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.511
- Look alive, man!
You're never gonna score a--

03:56.611 --> 03:58.146
- Nelson, is it
considered acceptable

03:58.246 --> 03:59.581
to take a nap mid-game?
- No.

03:59.648 --> 04:01.283
- No?
- What are you thinking?

04:01.349 --> 04:02.517
- Quick, like, a quick one.
- No, you can't take a nap.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.852
In the middle of the field?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.654
- Five-minute nap.
Please cover for me.

04:05.754 --> 04:07.622
- This is where
the dud nickname comes from.

04:07.689 --> 04:09.357
- Man down!

04:09.457 --> 04:12.761
- What is happening?
- Oh, great, that does it.

04:12.827 --> 04:15.363
This kid has got to go.
- No way, lady.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.099
Tom's doing great out there.
- He's sleeping.

04:18.166 --> 04:21.970
-
- He's just taking a power nap.

04:22.037 --> 04:23.204
- Now, on the field?

04:23.305 --> 04:25.206
- Come on, my son, Tom,
is great.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.609
- Stop defending your loser.
We want him gone.

04:27.676 --> 04:29.444
- Maybe we want you gone.

04:29.511 --> 04:31.212
Everybody, attention.
Listen up.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.014
What do you say we start
a petition

04:33.114 --> 04:35.717
to have this woman banned
from these games?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.218
- I like that idea.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.187
- You can all shove your
petitions up your assholes!

04:39.287 --> 04:42.157
- Honey, please, don't say
"asshole" in front of the kids.

04:42.223 --> 04:43.391
Aah!

04:43.491 --> 04:44.726
- Don't you dare question me
in public.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.827
- Wow!

04:45.894 --> 04:46.895
- Yes, ma'am.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.129
- How long was I asleep?

04:48.196 --> 04:49.731
This all happened
in two minutes?

04:50.565 --> 04:52.367
- All right, everybody,
thank you for coming.

04:52.467 --> 04:53.802
You know I appreciate it.

04:53.868 --> 04:56.071
I know my email said
this is a PTA meeting,

04:56.171 --> 04:58.239
but it's--it's actually
an intervention.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.408
- Thought so.
Gear up, Dakota's mom.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.976
- A petition
has been circulating

05:02.043 --> 05:03.812
to have Dakota's mom banned

05:03.878 --> 05:05.413
from all sporting events.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.315
- Wait a minute.
Is that what this is about?

05:07.382 --> 05:08.583
- This is great!

05:08.683 --> 05:10.085
- Dakota's mom,
in the administration,

05:10.185 --> 05:12.721
you are what we call
a "problem mom."

05:12.821 --> 05:15.423
- Problem mom? I'm--I'm
the only one without a problem.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.392
I'm looking out for my child.

05:17.492 --> 05:19.194
- Well,
it's not just you, okay?

05:19.260 --> 05:21.062
We've identified
three problem parents

05:21.162 --> 05:23.932
you, the original one;

05:24.032 --> 05:26.434
Randy's dad, who,
quite frankly, scares me...

05:26.534 --> 05:28.403
- I could crack you in half.

05:28.503 --> 05:30.271
- And, of course, Tom's mom.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.740
- Hang on,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.274
I'm the one who started
the petition.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.377
I coined the phrase
"problem mom."

05:35.443 --> 05:37.212
- Yes! That's exactly
the kind of thing

05:37.278 --> 05:39.080
that a problem mom would do.
- Wh--

05:39.180 --> 05:43.618
- If you want to attend
any more sporting events,

05:43.718 --> 05:45.353
I need you to attend
this seminar.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.088
- "Taking It Down a Notch"?

05:47.188 --> 05:48.623
- It's like driving school

05:48.723 --> 05:51.459
but for maniac parents
who can't conduct themselves

05:51.559 --> 05:54.062
in a civilized manner
around other people.

05:54.129 --> 05:55.463
- Fine by me.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.369
- Weird seminar music, no?

06:01.436 --> 06:05.807
- All right, everyone,
I want to welcome you all--

06:05.907 --> 06:07.142
Cut! Stop!

06:07.242 --> 06:08.943
Right now.

06:09.043 --> 06:13.314
Now, you're here because
you behave like Neanderthals.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.382
- What?
- Wait, what?

06:14.449 --> 06:15.750
- What did you just say?

06:15.817 --> 06:17.719
- Let's begin
with some role-playing.

06:17.786 --> 06:21.156
Let's pretend I'm, say,
a referee

06:21.256 --> 06:23.158
who just made a bad call.

06:23.258 --> 06:27.061
Dakota, how would, say,
your mother respond?

06:27.128 --> 06:29.264
- Uh, she'd say,
"Hey, nimrod, do you need me

06:29.330 --> 06:30.999
to shove that whistle
up your asshole?"

06:31.099 --> 06:33.968
Then she'd grab the whistle
and literally try to do it.

06:34.068 --> 06:35.837
- That doesn't sound
like me at all.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.339
- Mom, that literally
happened yesterday.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.508
<i>- Problem mom!</i>

06:40.608 --> 06:42.277
- We're making progress.

06:42.343 --> 06:44.813
Randy, what would your dad say?

06:44.913 --> 06:46.514
- My dad has
a bit of a temper, so--

06:46.614 --> 06:47.849
- You idiot!

06:47.949 --> 06:50.251
Why are you washing
our laundry in public?

06:50.318 --> 06:51.820
- Dad, please!
- Come on, we're out of here.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.154
- I want to stay
at the seminar.

06:53.254 --> 06:55.256
- Come here!
- Stop dragging me!

06:55.323 --> 06:58.660
- We're going.
We don't need this.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.862
<i>- Difficult dad!</i>

07:00.962 --> 07:02.030
- Let's move forward.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.932
Tom, what would
your mother say?

07:03.998 --> 07:06.334
- Can I sit this exercise out?

07:06.434 --> 07:08.336
If I impersonate my mom,
it's not gonna end well.

07:08.436 --> 07:10.605
- What do you mean,
not end well, in what sense?

07:10.672 --> 07:12.006
- It means
I'm gonna get punished.

07:12.106 --> 07:14.275
My mom does funny punishments,
okay?

07:14.342 --> 07:16.044
- Tom.
You know what? He's tired.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.545
- Name one.
- I don't know,

07:17.645 --> 07:19.280
like making me take a bath
in Mountain Dew

07:19.347 --> 07:21.149
and then be really sticky
when I go to school

07:21.216 --> 07:23.518
for the next week?
- Tom, let's put a sock in it.

07:23.618 --> 07:25.520
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's so sad.

07:25.620 --> 07:27.222
- She'll make me, like, run
around the block a few times

07:27.322 --> 07:29.324
with no pants on.
- Oh, let's don't tell this.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.159
- Make me scream,
"Look at my wiener!

07:31.226 --> 07:32.627
I should have cleaned my room."

07:32.694 --> 07:35.663
- So abuse
but with a lighthearted twist.

07:35.730 --> 07:38.366
- For your info,
he cleaned his room that night.

07:38.466 --> 07:41.069
Tell you that much.
<i>- Problem mom!</i>

07:41.169 --> 07:44.873
- No, no, Jacob, please,
for your own sake, don't do it.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.542
- Thanks for getting together,
guys.

07:47.642 --> 07:49.410
We should have done this
a long time ago.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.045
- Yeah, look,
I want to apologize.

07:51.145 --> 07:54.415
I really went off the rails.
I need to look inward.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.150
I realize that now.

07:56.217 --> 07:59.587
- Oh, yeah, you know,
being a parent is stressful.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.689
And I just--
I forgive everybody,

08:01.756 --> 08:02.991
because it's hard.
- Mm.

08:03.057 --> 08:04.526
- And let's be honest.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.528
Some of us don't--just don't
have the mental capacity

08:06.594 --> 08:08.830
to handle it.

08:08.897 --> 08:10.865
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

08:10.932 --> 08:12.400
It's just that, you know,
some people are like

08:12.500 --> 08:14.202
overgrown children
themselves, you know?

08:14.269 --> 08:16.204
- I get all that,
but why are you looking at me?

08:16.271 --> 08:17.939
- I'm looking at you
'cause I'm talking to you.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.174
Oh, my gosh.
- Listen up, lady.

08:20.241 --> 08:21.609
I did this to be nice.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.344
I don't need a creep
and a chubby bimbo

08:23.411 --> 08:25.280
calling me dumb
while I enjoy my latte.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.781
- Hey, hey, hey.
- That does it.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.516
Here, why don't you finish
my Frappuccino?

08:28.583 --> 08:29.751
- Whoa!

08:29.851 --> 08:31.452
- Yeah.
- You put it on my boobs?

08:31.553 --> 08:33.288
- You need something on them
to make them show up.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.590
- You know what?
Have a scone, Dakota's mom.

08:35.690 --> 08:37.392
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey, come on!

08:37.458 --> 08:40.061
Come on, hey,
let's be reasonable, huh?

08:40.128 --> 08:41.462
Look at us!

08:41.563 --> 08:43.298
- Excuse me,
if you're gonna pour the coffee

08:43.398 --> 08:46.234
on each other's boobs, I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

08:46.301 --> 08:49.604
- Okay, we need to finish
what we started at soccer.

08:49.704 --> 08:51.072
- Bring it on.
- Whoa! Hey!

08:51.139 --> 08:52.707
- Take that! In the eye!
There you go!

08:52.774 --> 08:54.642
- Come on, now, stop. Stop it!
- It's in my mouth!

08:54.742 --> 08:58.146
- Take it down a notch, okay?
- What?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.581
- If you have a disagreement,

08:59.647 --> 09:01.983
at least have
an organized fight

09:02.083 --> 09:03.985
where we can charge admission.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.388
- Oh, my God,
that's a great idea.

09:07.455 --> 09:10.158
- Okay, you can't sit on each
other in front of the doorway.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.760
You need to leave.
- Well, Mr. Sensitive.

09:12.827 --> 09:15.263
- Oh, Mr. Sensitive
Green Shirt.

09:16.898 --> 09:18.232
- Big night.
Coach started a mandatory

09:18.299 --> 09:19.434
"pass it to Tom" rule,

09:19.500 --> 09:20.902
so think I might score,
finally.

09:20.969 --> 09:22.604
- That's right, baby.
I'm hyped up, man.

09:22.670 --> 09:23.972
Good luck out there today.

09:24.072 --> 09:25.473
- Thank you, Nelson.
I appreciate that.

09:25.573 --> 09:26.975
<i>- Hi, kids.
Quick announcement here.</i>

09:27.075 --> 09:28.476
<i>I hope you're having
a large day.</i>

09:28.576 --> 09:30.178
<i>Today's soccer game
is canceled</i>

09:30.278 --> 09:31.846
<i>due to the overwhelming
interest</i>

09:31.946 --> 09:33.982
<i>in the fight being planned
in the gym.</i>

09:34.082 --> 09:36.351

is fighting in the school gym?

09:36.451 --> 09:38.519
<i>- Tell your parents
Tom's mom...</i>

09:38.620 --> 09:41.022
- Oh, no.
<i>- Will fight Dakota's mom...</i>

09:41.122 --> 09:42.123
- Oh, my goodness.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.192
<i>- In the gym tonight at 5:00</i>

09:44.292 --> 09:46.260
<i>and admission is $10.</i>

09:46.327 --> 09:49.030
- Uh, Tom, is there something
you want to tell me?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.633
- This is honestly
the first I'm hearing of it.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.706
- Uh, Mom?
- Mm-hmm, yeah?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.375
- Anything you want to share
with me?

10:00.475 --> 10:01.976
- No, can't--
can't think of anything.

10:02.043 --> 10:03.277
- You don't have any big fights

10:03.344 --> 10:04.846
or any kind of combat
scheduled?

10:04.946 --> 10:06.948
- Oh, the fight.
- "Oh, the fight"?

10:07.015 --> 10:08.516
- Tom, I wasn't gonna tell you.

10:08.616 --> 10:10.318
- Mom, I'm gonna find out
about something like that.

10:10.385 --> 10:12.120
What are you doing?
- Okay, well, look.

10:12.186 --> 10:13.454
I was shooting my mouth off,

10:13.521 --> 10:15.857
and it all
just got away from me.

10:15.957 --> 10:18.292
I don't want to fight her.
- So just cancel the fight.

10:18.359 --> 10:20.395
That's easy.
- No, I can't do that.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.696
- What do you mean, you can't?

10:21.796 --> 10:23.398
- Look, I would
happily cancel it,

10:23.498 --> 10:25.700
but I'm not gonna set
a bad example for my son.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.568
That would teach you
that it's okay to quit,

10:27.669 --> 10:29.637
and I'm not gonna do that, Tom.

10:29.704 --> 10:31.005
<i>♪ ♪</i>

10:31.072 --> 10:33.207
- I feel like you're setting
a bad example

10:33.307 --> 10:36.010
no matter how you play it
at this point.

10:36.077 --> 10:39.080
- Thanks for coming out, folks.
I know we're excited.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.815
I just want to make it clear.

10:40.882 --> 10:42.583
No biting, no kicking.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.687
And there's no tactful way to
say this in front of the kids.

10:45.753 --> 10:47.822
No punching in the pussy.
Thank you.

10:47.889 --> 10:49.223
- What?
- Oh, my God.

10:49.323 --> 10:50.491
- Does that really need
to be a rule?

10:51.926 --> 10:53.761
- Fight! Fight!

10:53.861 --> 10:55.363
- Hurt each other! Come on!

10:55.430 --> 10:56.931
- I don't know why you took
your bra off,

10:57.031 --> 10:58.933
but I'm about to punching bag
those bitches.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.768
- Why don't you just shut
your little trap, and let's--

11:00.868 --> 11:02.203
why don't we just start
fighting?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.337
- Okay, this
is complete madness.

11:03.404 --> 11:04.839
I need to stop this.

11:04.906 --> 11:06.941
All right, you know what?
Guys, hold on, hold on.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.876
I--I'm sorry,
I gotta interject.

11:08.943 --> 11:10.745
When I heard my mom
was gonna fight,

11:10.845 --> 11:13.514
it inspired me to write a poem.

11:13.581 --> 11:14.782
Jacob, if you don't mind.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.187
- This poem is called
"My Mom, My Hero."

11:19.253 --> 11:20.688
- Nuh-uh!

11:20.755 --> 11:22.557
You got us all riled up
for a fight

11:22.623 --> 11:25.026
and now you got little kids
reading poems?

11:25.093 --> 11:26.561
- I mean,
we paid good money for this!

11:26.627 --> 11:29.097
- Someone needs to fight,
or we're not leaving.

11:31.265 --> 11:33.468
- Tell me if this
is inappropriate,

11:33.568 --> 11:35.703
but I'd be happy
to fight my wife.

11:35.770 --> 11:36.938
- What?

11:37.038 --> 11:38.072
- That is a fight
I would like to see.

11:38.139 --> 11:39.474
- No.
- Yeah!

11:39.574 --> 11:40.641
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

11:40.742 --> 11:42.076

11:46.547 --> 11:48.249
