00:57.318 --> 00:59.494
Man: Watch your ranks.
Watch your files.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.775
Man: To the right.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.174
And halt.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.263
Drop.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.830
Archers.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.183
Retreat!

02:23.360 --> 02:26.407
Right. And march.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.417
Man: Archers, regroup.

02:42.074 --> 02:45.077
-Formation.
-And halt.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.995
Man: Spears.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.179
Man: Thrust!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.289
-And halt.

03:23.377 --> 03:24.552
Woman: Open ranks.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.316
Hold on, Jerry.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.969
Jerry:
I'm tryin', boss.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.495
Back up. Back up.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.583
Michonne: It's about
to get real, y'all.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.019
Everyone, steady.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.948
Fan out!

04:16.560 --> 04:18.258
Michonne: Hey,
stay in your formations!

04:18.301 --> 04:19.998
Remember your trainin'!

04:49.898 --> 04:51.726
On me.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.963
Luke: Weirdest thing
you ever pulled outta

05:12.007 --> 05:13.356
one of these ghost ships --
go.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.575
Oh, that would
definitely be

05:14.618 --> 05:16.359
the crate full
of hot-dog trophies.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.360
Is that a euphemism?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.883
What are you
talkin' 'bout?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.668
No.

05:20.711 --> 05:24.541
Literally trophies
shaped like dancing hot dogs.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.500
-Okay.
-I mean, I guess they --

05:26.543 --> 05:28.676
they sorta
looked euphemistic.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.242
Okay.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.376
Do you need help
with that?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
Um, no --Look like you need
a strong woman

05:35.509 --> 05:38.163
to help you with that --
among other things.

05:38.207 --> 05:41.384
I mean, y-yes, please.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.907
Thank you.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.387
Hey, Jules, um...

05:44.431 --> 05:46.258
a-are you --

05:46.302 --> 05:49.392
Yes, I am flirting with you
a little bit, Luke.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.262
Yes.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.439
Good. That's cool.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.788
As am I with you.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.877
Oh. Well, thanks.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.966
Training
was worth the trip.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.837
Yeah, they did good.
Mm.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.578
Tara would've been proud.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.538
Hm. Hope so.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.453
It's good
to bring the kids also,

06:06.496 --> 06:09.369
let 'em see the ocean
for the first time.

06:09.412 --> 06:12.372
Yeah, I know one idiot
that would've loved this.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.942
Judith: ♪ 15 miles
on the Erie Canal ♪

06:17.986 --> 06:23.339

and a good ol' pal ♪

06:23.383 --> 06:26.429
♪ 15 miles

06:33.871 --> 06:36.178
It was a fun day at the river
today, huh, R.J.?

06:36.221 --> 06:37.484
Yeah.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.703
Let's see
what you found.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.116
Kids found it
by the estuary.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.683
River must've
carried it down.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.250
Gabriel:
What does it mean?

07:48.293 --> 07:49.512
Are they back?

07:49.556 --> 07:50.905
We don't know.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.255
But Alexandria should go
on lockdown just in case.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.258
Hold on.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.478
We don't have evidence
to justify that.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.696
My official recommendation

07:59.740 --> 08:01.611
is that everyone
should stay on alert

08:01.655 --> 08:02.656
until further notice.

08:02.699 --> 08:03.787
Eyes and ears open.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.049
That's it.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.227
Copy that.
Over and out.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.794
Sounds good.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.274
Over and out.

08:12.317 --> 08:15.799
I appreciate your caution,
and I get it,

08:15.843 --> 08:17.888
but we do not need
to start a panic.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.630
A lot of stuff washed up ashore
from the recent storm.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.197
Th-This might not
mean anything.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.677
Or it might
mean something.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.679
Look, no one saw
Alpha's herd move out,

08:25.722 --> 08:27.898
so maybe no one saw them
move back in.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.465
But if there's a mask,

08:29.509 --> 08:32.250
maybe there are other signs
of them out there.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.687
We owe it to our people
to be sure.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.519
I'll gather a group.
We'll leave in five.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.564
I'm-a hang back
for a bit.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.000
I'll catch up.

08:43.044 --> 08:46.003
Tell her not to leave again
without saying goodbye.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.701
Alright.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.749
Michonne:
Okay, let's split up.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.665
You see any sign of them,
call it in.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.433
Aaron: Michonne...
Yeah.

09:24.476 --> 09:27.610
...are we
the good guys?

09:27.654 --> 09:29.177
Why would you ask that?

09:29.220 --> 09:31.832
I think about it a lot.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.052
We're the villains
of someone else's story,

09:35.096 --> 09:36.880
a threat
to their survival,

09:36.924 --> 09:40.144
so dangerous they threaten
to wipe us out.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.932
Makes you wonder
sometimes.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.977
I don't give a shit
about the Whisperers

09:47.021 --> 09:48.370
or where they stand.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.764
I'm not just talkin'
'bout the Whisperers.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.579
Anything?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.450
Yumiko:
Nothing so far.

10:25.494 --> 10:29.498
Luke: Nada over here.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.935
You know, we may never
find an answer to this.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.371
They cover their tracks.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.417
If there's a mask,
there's a reason.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.551
Come on.

10:39.595 --> 10:40.770
Hey! Shit.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.032
Come on.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.298
Whoa.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.831
Watch their hands!

11:03.793 --> 11:05.577
Damn it.

11:09.886 --> 11:10.844
Duck!

11:21.593 --> 11:23.770
Well, that was stupid.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.772
We agreed not
to cross their borders

11:25.815 --> 11:28.122
or to start anything
without a reason.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.950
I lost Rick on a --

11:36.391 --> 11:39.829
If it was them,
you could've died.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.832
And it wasn't them,
and you could've died.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.530
For what?

11:45.574 --> 11:49.839
We've all been acting
like this is normal,

11:49.883 --> 11:53.060
holding our breaths
for months.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.975
This isn't normal.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.847
We have to keep our cool,
or they win.

11:57.891 --> 12:00.371
I've been keeping my cool
my whole life.

12:00.415 --> 12:05.550
I've always been the nice guy,
the Good Samaritan.

12:06.813 --> 12:10.904
But the thing is,
Eric is dead.

12:10.947 --> 12:14.908
Jesus is dead.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.127
And I'm Goddamn sick
of bein' nice.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.042
Well, good,

12:19.086 --> 12:21.653
'cause nice
never got me anywhere.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.917
But smart did.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.876
They have a nuclear weapon,
and we don't.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.575
It's not about being nice
or good

12:30.619 --> 12:32.664
or anything
but keeping our people alive

12:32.708 --> 12:34.884
and not having them die
over nothing.

12:38.496 --> 12:42.109
Believe me.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.981
I hate this, too.

12:47.854 --> 12:51.553
We should get back
before dark.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.168
We didn't find anything.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.431
We're circling back.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.955
Yumiko: Hold on.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.957
There's something
you all should see.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.382
It's a campsite.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.340
Couple people.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.081
What am I missin'?

13:41.124 --> 13:44.040
This is not what
we wanted to show you.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.493
Luke: Campers must've
got into a fight

14:02.537 --> 14:04.365
with these walkers,
right?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.758
Or maybe the two things
aren't connected.

14:27.257 --> 14:31.000
Looks like he's been here
for a while.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.632
Aaron: A skin.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.815
So at least one of 'em
has been

15:03.859 --> 15:05.295
on our side of the border
at some point.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.776
Yeah, but when?

15:07.819 --> 15:10.170
And what the hell
happened here?

15:16.828 --> 15:20.006
Michonne:
I can see what's coming
unless we stop it.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.095
Fear is dangerous.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.228
It can drive us apart
again.

15:25.272 --> 15:29.102
And we're gonna
need to squash it
before it starts.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.756
But fear
can also keep us safe.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.933
I forgot that
on the bridge.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.413
I was telling you
to be smart,

15:36.457 --> 15:39.155
not afraid.

15:39.199 --> 15:42.942
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier,

15:42.985 --> 15:45.945
'bout who we've become,
who we are.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.863
And the truth is,

15:51.907 --> 15:56.042
we are the good guys.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.958
And I know
who Rick and Carl were --

15:59.001 --> 16:02.178
and Eric and Jesus, too.

16:02.222 --> 16:05.051
We have to choose
to be the good guys

16:05.094 --> 16:09.272
even when it's hard.

16:09.316 --> 16:12.667
And...the minute

16:12.710 --> 16:16.149
that we start
to question that

16:16.192 --> 16:19.891
and we lose sight of it,

16:19.935 --> 16:21.806
that's when the answer
to that question

16:21.850 --> 16:23.199
starts to change,

16:23.243 --> 16:28.813
and that's scarier
than any skin mask.

16:37.344 --> 16:41.261
Judith: And the Brave Man
rode the horse very, very far,

16:41.304 --> 16:45.178
trying to lead
the gigantic herd away.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.049
But after a while,

16:47.093 --> 16:49.095
the horse got scared
and ran away,

16:49.138 --> 16:51.445
leaving the Brave Man
all alone.

16:51.488 --> 16:55.057
So the Brave Man walked
all by himself to the bridge.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.712
Remember how he built the bridge
for all his friends?
Yeah.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.106
Well,
the millions of walkers

17:00.149 --> 17:02.586
followed the Brave Man
onto the bridge,

17:02.630 --> 17:03.935
and on the other side,

17:03.979 --> 17:05.241
all his friends
were waiting.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.069
The Brave Man
couldn't let the walkers

17:07.113 --> 17:08.940
reach his friends
and hurt them,

17:08.984 --> 17:10.159
so he blew up the bridge,

17:10.203 --> 17:11.682
and all the walkers
fell into the water

17:11.726 --> 17:13.249
and he saved
all his friends.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.772
The end.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.774
Did the Brave Man go to his
friend's house after that?

17:16.818 --> 17:18.080
No.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.126
He died
and went to heaven.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.651
Will he come back someday,
like the walkers?

17:23.694 --> 17:26.262
No, not like that.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.699
But people,
like the Brave Man,

17:28.743 --> 17:30.484
are never really gone
anyway.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.965
He lives inside our hearts
and makes us brave, too.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.883
Hey.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.711
Is anybody gonna
say hi?

17:40.755 --> 17:41.973
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.106
-Hi.
-Hi, Mom.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.586
Michonne: Come on.

17:45.629 --> 17:50.025
Hi. Ooh.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.636
You, too, baby girl.
Come here.

17:54.769 --> 17:55.813
I know, I know.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.467
Mm.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.729
Hi.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.082
Mama, I didn't like it
when the Brave Man died.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.170
Why did he do that?

18:04.213 --> 18:07.173
Well...

18:07.216 --> 18:10.045
there are some people
that you love so much

18:10.089 --> 18:12.787
that you would do
anything for them,

18:12.830 --> 18:15.355
just like I would do
anything for you

18:15.398 --> 18:16.965
and for Judith.

18:18.619 --> 18:19.794
And my dad?

18:19.837 --> 18:22.449
Yes. And your dad.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.194
Alright, bring it back in.
Come on.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.678
-What is that?
-What is it?

18:39.814 --> 18:41.946
Is that
a meteor shower?Michonne: Get back.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.035
-I see it.
-Oh, I see it now.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.691
Woman: What is that?

18:49.345 --> 18:51.956
Michonne,
Eugene's on the radio.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.654
He needs
to talk to you now.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.314
Kids found it
by the estuary.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.620
River must've
carried it down.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.622
What does it mean?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.233
Are they back?

19:07.276 --> 19:08.930
Aaron: We don't know.

19:08.973 --> 19:12.020
But Alexandria should go
on lockdown just in case.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.413

We don't have evidence
to justify that.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.286

20:33.014 --> 20:34.581
Not more, not less.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.453
So if I were
to heat the milk up

20:37.497 --> 20:39.455
for, like, 5 minutes
and 18 seconds --

20:39.499 --> 20:41.501
I have rigged
the kitchen timer to go off

20:41.544 --> 20:42.676
at precisely 5 and 16

20:42.719 --> 20:44.721
so such a scenario
will not come to pass.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.462
Furthermore,
I've taken the liberty

20:46.506 --> 20:48.899
of chartin' her feedin's
and diaper changes.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.337
She is very regular.
Congratulations.

20:51.380 --> 20:54.296
Eugene, she's a baby,
not a science experiment.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.168
You can't boil people down
to charts and graphs.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.214
No, you know what?
I'll take it.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.827
Might not use it all
or, like, any of it,

21:03.871 --> 21:05.307
but thanks.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.439
You know,
ever since everyone

21:06.482 --> 21:08.484
got those damn
radio setups, Eugene,

21:08.528 --> 21:11.139
this one's been doing
nothing but talking.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.272
You gotta move that thing
outta the house.

21:14.925 --> 21:18.364
Hey, man,
is everything okay?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.672
Lydia:
"Yes, the girl said.

21:22.716 --> 21:26.154
I have rec..."

21:26.197 --> 21:29.288
"Received."

21:31.420 --> 21:33.553
I've gone my whole life
without reading.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.685
I don't see the point
in learning how to do it now.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.818
It'll open
a whole new world for you.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.254
And you're picking it up
so quick.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.473
You're a natural.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.779
There's nothin' natural
about this.

21:48.437 --> 21:51.310
Gabriel:
We need the room.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.444
Should she be here
for this?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.590
Negan: Hey, kid.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.509
Everything okay?

22:16.552 --> 22:19.816
Fine.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.863
Exactly the same as it was
20 minutes ago.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.517
What was
the big meeting for?

22:24.560 --> 22:26.736
And why are folks
givin' you the side eye?

22:26.780 --> 22:30.610
Same folks eyein' you.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.481
What have you done in the past
however many years

22:32.525 --> 22:34.614
you've been here, huh?Brandon: Negan.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.706
Get back to work, sir.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.710
Hey, you're supposed
to keep your distance.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.498
They're on alert.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.500
Why?

22:51.544 --> 22:54.416
Someone found a skin.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.550
What does "alert" mean?

22:57.593 --> 22:59.508
You've been here longer.

22:59.552 --> 23:00.988
You tell me.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.904
It means watch your back,
kid.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.226
Hey, boss.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.456
There you go.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.422
Oh, hm?
Trippy, right?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.816
Okay, you chill.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.732
I'll be right back.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.849
Dante: Jefe?

24:19.893 --> 24:21.895
Earth to El Jefe.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.638
There you are, Jef.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.555
Dante.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.600
What are you doing here?

24:31.644 --> 24:33.384
Dude, your spawn was
screamin' bloody murder.

24:33.428 --> 24:34.647
I could hear it
down in the infirmary.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.083
I just --

24:36.126 --> 24:37.432
Oh, shit.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.607
I wanted to make sure
you were cool.

24:38.651 --> 24:39.869
Hey.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.176
So...

24:42.219 --> 24:43.612
you cool?

24:45.745 --> 24:48.748
Just, you know,
dealing with...

24:48.791 --> 24:51.533
household pests
and shit.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.621
Good thing I got to town

24:52.665 --> 24:54.275
in time for you
to play house.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.844
I reorganized the meds.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.715
Infirmary's hummin'.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.848
Might've earned my keep
for the day.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.415
Though, who are we kiddin'?

25:04.459 --> 25:06.766
We're like Gods
in the apocalypse.

25:08.811 --> 25:12.728
By the way, this
yellow-alert bidness,

25:12.772 --> 25:14.730
damn.

25:14.774 --> 25:19.039
So what's with
this Whisperers thing?

25:20.780 --> 25:23.130
You wanna get a room?

25:23.173 --> 25:25.741
E-Excuse me?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.482
The way
you're starin' at my mouth

25:27.526 --> 25:30.050
is makin' me
warm and tingly inside.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.314
Kiss me already.
Shit.

25:35.316 --> 25:36.622
So tempting.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.276
Yeah.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.714
But, uh, I need
to get this kid to sleep.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.804
So thank you
for checkin' on me.
Yeah.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.370
Anytime, man.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.505
Or should I say "God"?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.795
I'm surprised you knocked off
work early.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.362
I thought
you couldn't get enough

26:21.405 --> 26:22.581
of the great outdoors.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.714
It's starting.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.716
Listen, if you've got
something to say,

26:27.760 --> 26:29.849
can you just please
get to the point?

26:29.892 --> 26:31.590
Because I don't
have time today.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.287
Seriously.Aw, Gabey boy,

26:33.330 --> 26:35.637
why don't you just
nestle in below me

26:35.681 --> 26:38.422
and let me baby bird
a little bit of my wisdom

26:38.466 --> 26:40.816
into that pretty little mouth
of yours?

26:40.860 --> 26:44.167
You see, people tend
to get mixed up on

26:44.211 --> 26:46.822
about who they hate.

26:46.866 --> 26:52.306
Yesterday,
I was public enemy number one.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.524
Now?

26:53.568 --> 26:54.874
Well, now I'm the guy

26:54.917 --> 26:58.442
that picks the vegetables
and takes out the trash.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.662
I'm okay with that.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.795
For now, at least.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.972
But until
this whole thing passes,

27:06.015 --> 27:09.497
I'm gonna keep my head down
so people don't move me

27:09.540 --> 27:11.542
from the proverbial
semi-"us" category

27:11.586 --> 27:13.762
to the category
of "them."

27:13.806 --> 27:16.504
That's not
what's happening here.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.376
I didn't say it is.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.161
I said that it will.

27:21.204 --> 27:22.466
You see, the boogeyman

27:22.510 --> 27:24.817
just stuck his
gnarly skin-covered mask

27:24.860 --> 27:27.471
out from behind
that closet door,

27:27.515 --> 27:30.561
and people are puttin'
their shittin' pants back on

27:30.605 --> 27:34.696
because pants-shittin'
is definitely happenin'.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.613
Now, with this, uh,
alert shit,

27:38.657 --> 27:40.746
all I'm seein'
is indecision.

27:40.789 --> 27:45.315
Now, you ask me,
you gotta make 'em feel secure,

27:45.359 --> 27:47.709
even if it's just
for show.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.058
Sorta like
how you have a guy

27:49.102 --> 27:51.408
followin' me around
with a spear all day

27:51.452 --> 27:52.714
in case I suddenly decide

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
I'm gonna brain somebody
with a tomato.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.937
So you're telling me
to lie?

27:57.980 --> 27:59.895
That's your advice?

27:59.939 --> 28:02.550
That's your regurgitated
bird wisdom?

28:02.593 --> 28:03.986
No, not lie.

28:04.030 --> 28:07.511
At most, I'm talkin' about
a little strategic omission,

28:07.555 --> 28:10.863
maybe minor misleading.

28:10.906 --> 28:14.301
Think of it as
using the truth to manipulate.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.782
But, hell,
at the end of the day,

28:16.825 --> 28:20.829
if that's what
keeps people alive,

28:20.873 --> 28:22.918
what's the harm?

28:42.024 --> 28:43.852
Lock the gates
for the night,

28:43.896 --> 28:46.115
and let's double up security
at the walls.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.524
Alexandria to Oceanside.
Come in, Oceanside.

29:03.567 --> 29:04.786
Please, pick up.

29:04.830 --> 29:05.961
Rachel:
Oceanside copies.

29:06.005 --> 29:07.876
This is Rachel.This is Eugene.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.312
I need
to speak with Michonne

29:09.356 --> 29:11.837
and any of the community
leadership at O.S. right away.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.274
Somethin' of grave importance
is about to happen.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.803
Kids found it
by the estuary.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.370
River must've
carried it down.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.285
Gabriel:
What does it mean?

29:25.328 --> 29:27.200
Are they back?

29:27.243 --> 29:28.375
Woman: Pull!

29:36.078 --> 29:38.559
Crap.
Heads up, Kel.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.995
Woman: Go further!

29:40.039 --> 29:41.388
That's further!

29:41.431 --> 29:42.737
Heads up behind you,
Kel.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.870
Watch your step.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.610
Woman:
Alright, let it drop.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.221
Sorry.

31:32.194 --> 31:35.502
You ever wonder
why they call bird shit "guano"?

31:35.545 --> 31:37.025
Nah.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.114
I just call it
bird shit.

31:39.158 --> 31:42.117
Yeah.

31:42.161 --> 31:43.989
Me, too.

31:46.121 --> 31:49.081
You know somethin',
when I worked in a zoo,

31:49.124 --> 31:51.866
birds used to scare
the hell out of me.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.259
Lions, tigers, no problem.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.783
There's a kind of sense
to the way big cats operate.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.960
But ostriches?

31:59.004 --> 32:01.006
Those things'll disembowel you
for lookin' at 'em sideways.

32:01.049 --> 32:06.446
You gotta eat more birds,
show 'em who's boss.

32:06.489 --> 32:09.449
Wonder what seagull
tastes like.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.580
Not chicken.

32:15.324 --> 32:18.197
Hi. Hi, buddy. Hi.

32:21.156 --> 32:23.115
Uh.

32:23.158 --> 32:28.076
No, he just likes you
better.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.208
Right?

32:31.166 --> 32:32.994
Hi. Hi.

32:34.648 --> 32:36.128
Good Dog.

32:46.529 --> 32:47.922
Really?

32:52.405 --> 32:54.929
Hey.

33:09.117 --> 33:10.771
Carol.

33:18.518 --> 33:19.519
Hey.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.434
Hey.

33:21.477 --> 33:22.478
It's good to see you.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.698
You, too.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.091
You look good.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.006
Thanks.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.138
Sorry. Um, excuse me.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.792
Yeah.

33:39.887 --> 33:42.281
Did ya miss me?

33:42.324 --> 33:43.630
Not really.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.284
I'll take that.

33:49.853 --> 33:54.075
So, how was it
out there?

33:54.119 --> 33:57.296
Work till you feel like
your back's gonna break,

33:57.339 --> 33:58.775
then you work some more,

33:58.819 --> 34:00.125
and at the end of the night,

34:00.168 --> 34:02.692
you fall down and
sleep like the dead

34:02.736 --> 34:05.173
on a deck
under the stars.

34:05.217 --> 34:06.740
It's the best.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.176
You find
what you were lookin' for?

34:08.220 --> 34:10.787
Oh, then we sailed down south
to this dock

34:10.831 --> 34:14.313
where Oceanside's been
pickin' up letters from Maggie.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.967
Wasn't anything there.
Hasn't been for a while.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.100
It's been a while
since I heard from ya.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.537
I told you,
fishing's hard.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.974
That's not what I mean.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.281
You were lookin' for her,
weren't ya?

34:26.325 --> 34:28.501
No.
Mm-hmm.

34:28.544 --> 34:30.416
Honestly, no.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.983
Tried to forget
everything that happened.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.463
It was good.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.248
And if we're lucky,
we'll never have to think about

34:36.291 --> 34:39.077
those skin freaks
ever again.

34:41.296 --> 34:44.082
What?

34:44.125 --> 34:46.954
We found
one of their masks today.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.611
Okay.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.830
Michonne just took a group out
looking for signs of 'em.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.876
You wanna go?

34:57.486 --> 34:59.836
No.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.099
I'm only -- I'm only here

35:01.142 --> 35:03.362
till the next boat
heads out.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.755
Alright.

35:05.799 --> 35:08.236
So, what you wanna do?

35:10.499 --> 35:12.327
Carol: Never been
through here before.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.155
Daryl: Yeah,
we just cleared it out

35:14.199 --> 35:16.244
to get around
the river border.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.334
Faster.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.814
Hang on.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.053
I had that one.

35:43.097 --> 35:45.969
Well, you're supposed
to call it.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.928
You didn't call it.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.190
Don't wanna play
with you anymore

35:49.234 --> 35:50.539
if you cheat every time.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.019
I'm not cheating.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.589
Watch their hands.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.466
Stop.

36:47.509 --> 36:48.641
Why?

36:48.684 --> 36:51.209
It's one of her borders.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.297
They're walkers.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.037
We can still get the deer.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.604
No, it's too late.

36:55.648 --> 36:59.086
Why are we still
respecting borders
we never agreed to

36:59.129 --> 37:00.522
when Alpha
isn't even here?

37:00.566 --> 37:03.264
Can we just forget
bout them already?It's too late.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.361
That deer could've fed
200 people.

37:22.892 --> 37:27.767
I'm sorry
I pissed you off.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.813
I'm sorry you pissed me off,
too.

37:31.423 --> 37:34.164
Well, there's no reason
to start shit if we don't gotta.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.471
After the storm,
we all agreed to that.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.476
That's why it's just as well
that I left.

37:43.173 --> 37:46.829
Yeah, I've been
thinkin' about that.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.876
Why don't
you come on home now?

37:49.919 --> 37:52.313
I'm a sea dog, man.

37:52.357 --> 37:56.317
Would you get off my ass
before I put you on yours?

37:57.971 --> 37:59.451
Sorry if I didn't want
my best friend

37:59.494 --> 38:02.497
to spend her whole life
on a boat.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.760
Best friend?

38:04.804 --> 38:06.327
What are you, 10?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.068
Whatever.

38:08.111 --> 38:10.679
Should we have
matching bracelets now?

38:10.723 --> 38:12.420
Oh, God, forget it.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.640
No, I could make some
with fisherman's twine.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.555
Decorate 'em.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.252
It'll be really cute
with tiny, little seashells.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.471
Oh, my God.
I take it back.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.386
No,
what's your favorite color?

38:21.429 --> 38:22.996
Green? Blue?

38:23.039 --> 38:25.781
Black.
Definitely black.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.043
I got an idea.

38:27.087 --> 38:29.307
Why don't we eat
and not talk?

38:33.180 --> 38:34.964
Should we make
a matching collar for Dog?

38:49.457 --> 38:51.416
Daryl?

38:51.459 --> 38:54.549
Yeah?

38:54.593 --> 38:58.118
You ever wonder
if this is all there is?

38:58.161 --> 39:01.469
Just run into people,

39:01.513 --> 39:03.123
kill each other

39:03.166 --> 39:05.343
until whoever's left
says enough?

39:05.386 --> 39:07.432
Sometimes
I think we're just survivin'

39:07.475 --> 39:08.911
one fight to the next.

39:08.955 --> 39:12.393
It was like that for you and me
before all this.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.612
Yep.

39:13.655 --> 39:16.658
There's got to be people
out there like us.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.878
Right?

39:23.361 --> 39:26.799
I get what Maggie's doin'
with Georgie.

39:26.842 --> 39:29.236
I do.

39:32.152 --> 39:34.415
Go out on the boat with me
this time.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.592
Just run away together?

39:37.636 --> 39:41.509
Be pirates. Heck yeah.

39:41.553 --> 39:42.684
Nah.

39:42.728 --> 39:45.383
Cooped up in those little cabins
all day?

39:45.426 --> 39:48.298
That's not me.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.561
Screw the boat.

39:49.604 --> 39:52.694
We'll take your bike
and go out on the road.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.479
Better.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.002
Head out West.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.265
New Mexico.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.789
What the hell's
in New Mexico?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.791
People
who weave bracelets.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.450
No more fightin'.

40:09.494 --> 40:12.235
Just get on the bike
and go,

40:12.279 --> 40:14.237
see who's left.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.292
Sounds good to me.

40:54.539 --> 40:57.498
Magna: This is crazy.
We can't do this.We don't have a choice.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.152
If we get caught on
their side of the border,

40:59.195 --> 41:01.415
that's it, that's war.It's a fire.
Fires spread.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.462
It could burn through
our hunting grounds.Or take out Oceanside.

41:04.505 --> 41:07.682
Michonne,
are we doin' this?

41:07.726 --> 41:10.598
-We gotta go now.
-Let's go. Come on.

41:41.542 --> 41:45.285
We start on the outside,
push in.

42:09.701 --> 42:12.921
It's gonna be
a long night, son.

42:12.965 --> 42:15.054
A long, hot night.

42:17.839 --> 42:21.364
Aaron: As soon as you clear
your area, move to the ends.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.062
Keep digging.

42:23.105 --> 42:25.717
We've gotta get this done
before the fire jumps spine.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.589
-Come on.
- God damn it.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.373
-Magna.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.593
-Magna.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.595
Yumiko: Magna.Magna: What?

42:34.639 --> 42:36.466
You're spinning out.I'm fine.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.164
No, you're not.
What's wrong?

42:38.207 --> 42:40.296
Look around.

42:54.659 --> 42:57.226
-Where we going? Where we going?
-To the fire line.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.751
Grab your bucket.

43:01.927 --> 43:03.668
Aaron: Alright,
everybody clear back.

43:03.711 --> 43:05.408
Clear back.

43:05.452 --> 43:06.975
We need to back-burn
the stray fuel

43:07.019 --> 43:09.195
by the control line
so the fire can't spread.

43:09.238 --> 43:10.762
Yumiko:
Let's light it up.

43:45.884 --> 43:47.537
Yo, boss.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.409
Not your boss, Jerry.

43:49.452 --> 43:50.932
Pace yourself maybe.

43:50.976 --> 43:53.065
It's gonna take a minute.

43:54.719 --> 43:56.111
Fire was the beginning
of the end for the Kingdom.

43:56.155 --> 43:58.331
We're not letting that happen
to Oceanside.

43:59.593 --> 44:00.725
You okay, boss?

44:00.768 --> 44:04.163
Let me take point
in this round, okay?

44:14.303 --> 44:18.612
Cyndie:
I'm outta water.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.918
Daryl: I'm out.

44:25.837 --> 44:29.710
Man: Hey!
Walkers coming in!

44:29.754 --> 44:31.712
Man: On your six!Daryl.

44:31.756 --> 44:33.888
Bring the weapons.

44:37.587 --> 44:39.546
Magna: Heads up!

44:39.589 --> 44:41.722
Man:
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

44:59.871 --> 45:01.046
Man: How many we got?

45:24.809 --> 45:27.072
Woman: Come on!

45:27.115 --> 45:29.901
Man: Let's stay on the fire.
Put it out.

45:29.944 --> 45:32.164
Walkers!

45:32.207 --> 45:34.122
There's too many!

45:44.437 --> 45:47.701
Lead them to the fire!

46:15.076 --> 46:18.558
Come on! Go, go!

46:20.429 --> 46:22.649
Hurry!

46:28.046 --> 46:29.961
Here!

46:34.226 --> 46:36.315
Man: Watch your back!

47:03.124 --> 47:06.127
There's too many of 'em!

47:06.171 --> 47:08.869
Everyone, stay clear
of that tree!

47:08.913 --> 47:10.436
It's gonna fall any minuto!

47:12.742 --> 47:14.614
Get back.

47:16.572 --> 47:18.748
Get outta here!

48:04.969 --> 48:07.058
Michonne: Come on, come on.
Pack up and move.

48:07.101 --> 48:09.495
Aaron:
Let's go, let's go!

48:09.538 --> 48:11.932
Eugene, let's go.

48:11.976 --> 48:14.456
I just need 20 minutes.You get zero.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.415
We gotta go now.Ten. Just 10.

48:16.458 --> 48:18.896
We should excavate and transport
this satellite to our vehicles.

48:18.939 --> 48:22.203
I believe there may be
invaluable technological
implications for our communities

48:22.247 --> 48:25.032
if I'm able to retrieve any of
the useful bits from inside.

48:25.076 --> 48:27.165
I'm not askin'.
Oh, my God.

48:27.208 --> 48:30.603
Yumiko, Luke, Magna,
everybody, come on.

48:30.646 --> 48:34.215
We're helpin'
with the satellite.
Five minutes and out.

48:37.827 --> 48:43.616
Hey, uh, Eugenius,
what about radiation, man?

48:43.659 --> 48:45.923
Uh, there's radiation
all around us.

48:45.966 --> 48:47.620
Certainly, there's radiation
from space,

48:47.663 --> 48:50.579
but every one of us
is already infected
with some kinda nasty

48:50.623 --> 48:53.843
that changes us into epidermis
Epicureans at point of R.I.P.

48:53.887 --> 48:56.934
I mean, I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.I got it, man.

48:56.977 --> 48:59.980
No one's gettin' superpowers
today. I'm on it.

49:00.024 --> 49:03.027
Cuttin' into my 10 minutes.

49:03.070 --> 49:05.551
Alright.

49:07.161 --> 49:09.294
We made
the right choice.

49:09.337 --> 49:11.687
Let's not push our luck.

49:11.731 --> 49:13.907
Well, maybe this
buys us some goodwill.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.996
This helps them, too.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.650
We helped ourpeople.

49:17.693 --> 49:20.044
That's enough good for me
for now.

49:22.176 --> 49:25.136
Where are Carol
and Daryl?

49:35.885 --> 49:39.672
You still wanna run away
together?

49:39.715 --> 49:42.370
Yeah.

49:42.414 --> 49:45.069
Tomorrow.

49:47.071 --> 49:50.030
Look, I need you to stay.

49:54.382 --> 49:57.298
Just think about it.

50:01.259 --> 50:04.914
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
punch holes in all them boats.
