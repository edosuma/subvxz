[Man] Tonight we have with us,
from the Ministry of Information…

01:34.989 --> 01:37.651
Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.

01:37.758 --> 01:39.720
[Helpmann]
Good evening, David.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.158
What do you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

01:44.198 --> 01:46.564
Bad sportsmanship.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.897
A ruthless minority of people…

01:49.003 --> 01:53.133
seems to have forgotten certain
good old-fashioned virtues.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.474
They just can't stand
seeing the other fella win.

01:56.577 --> 01:59.173
If these people
would just play the game…

01:59.213 --> 02:01.342
they'd get a lot more out of life.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.245
Nevertheless, Mr Helpmann,
there are those who maintain…

02:04.285 --> 02:07.681
that the Ministry of Information
has become too large and unwieldy.

02:07.721 --> 02:10.985
[Helpmann] David, in a free society,
information's the name of the game.

02:11.025 --> 02:13.854
You can't win the game
if you're a man short.

02:13.894 --> 02:18.292
[David] And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister.
Seven percent of the gross national product.

02:18.332 --> 02:21.629
[Helpmann] I understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer.

02:21.669 --> 02:23.569
People want value for money.

02:23.671 --> 02:29.041
That's why we always insist on the principle
of information retrieval charges.

02:29.143 --> 02:32.306
<i>–[Fly Buzzing]
–It's absolutely right and fair…</i>

02:32.346 --> 02:35.643
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention…

<i>and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

02:41.221 --> 02:44.285
Do you believe that the government
is winning the battle against terrorists?

02:44.325 --> 02:48.125
Oh, yes. Our morale
is much higher than theirs.

but we were close friends.
