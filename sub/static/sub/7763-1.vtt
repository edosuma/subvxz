eat our chicken?

It was my egg first.

17:16.489 --> 17:21.025
Look, according to the scrolls
I have had read to me,

17:21.026 --> 17:22.794
I banished the king.

17:22.795 --> 17:27.065
So, technically, I am
the true king of Valencia.

17:27.066 --> 17:31.436
And it would really mean a lot
to me if I was treated as such.

17:31.437 --> 17:34.471
What is it with men and their <i> emotions?</i>

17:37.009 --> 17:39.110

- Nah, it's great. It's fine.

Psst! Hey!

17:59.532 --> 18:00.565

18:07.006 --> 18:08.473
about when we were gonna come ashore

I'm rescuing us.

18:32.197 --> 18:34.098

built to be up to code,

18:44.009 --> 18:45.376
but no one was ever going to use it,

Are you certain we can't
convince you to come with us?

19:04.597 --> 19:07.799
No, son. My Destiny is here.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.769
Destiny, this is Richard. Richard, Destiny.

19:11.770 --> 19:12.904
Hello.

19:12.905 --> 19:13.905
Hi.

19:13.906 --> 19:15.773
Man: Galavant!

19:15.774 --> 19:17.175
Man #2: Galavant!

19:17.176 --> 19:18.476
You must go now!

19:18.477 --> 19:19.477
I'll miss you.

19:19.478 --> 19:21.245
Godspeed.

19:21.246 --> 19:22.780
Let's boogie!

19:22.781 --> 19:23.781
Hello.

19:23.782 --> 19:26.150
Yeah.

19:26.151 --> 19:28.486
[Birds chirping]

19:28.487 --> 19:30.555
[Breathing heavily]

19:30.556 --> 19:32.156
Hey!

19:32.157 --> 19:34.158
This is a silly question.

19:34.159 --> 19:36.394
Do you think my Uncle Keith might be...

19:36.395 --> 19:37.428
Yes, Richard.

19:37.429 --> 19:39.263
Wow.

19:39.264 --> 19:40.829
You think Destiny knows?

19:42.434 --> 19:44.736
You know what? I owe you an apology

19:44.737 --> 19:46.671
'cause you really came through
for us today.

19:46.672 --> 19:47.804
Thank you.

19:48.674 --> 19:50.508
I know you don't think much of me,

19:50.509 --> 19:52.844
and I know I screw everything up
all the time,

19:52.845 --> 19:55.680
but you have to understand,
I was coddled my entire life.

19:55.681 --> 19:56.814
I know.

19:56.815 --> 19:58.416
I was breastfed until I was 9.

19:58.417 --> 19:59.684
I kno... wait. What?

19:59.685 --> 20:02.453
- I had a nanny named Pearl...
- No, I don't want to know.

20:02.454 --> 20:04.455
The point is, today's a new day.

20:04.456 --> 20:06.958
This is a new chapter in your life.

20:06.959 --> 20:09.260
You got to find your inner king.

20:09.261 --> 20:11.162
You really think so?

20:11.163 --> 20:13.096
I do.
