01:27.147 --> 01:28.357
Reasons...

01:29.760 --> 01:32.868
We all got our reasons to do crazy,

01:33.165 --> 01:34.774
and reckless things in life.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.027
Mostly they don't help you none.

01:39.355 --> 01:41.175
Not when you are left to
pick up the pieces.

01:42.909 --> 01:45.709
But if the reason is love,

01:45.807 --> 01:49.793
then maybe not so crazy,
because people believe in love.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.644
They know it keeps the world turning.

01:53.731 --> 01:55.528
And right now,

01:56.723 --> 01:58.823
that's the only thing keeping me alive.

03:02.087 --> 03:03.657
What did you do?
What did you say you wanted?

03:07.349 --> 03:08.469
Double.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.953
American?

03:34.706 --> 03:37.924
- It is so obvious?
- No, no, no, I heard you at the bar.

03:39.971 --> 03:41.791
I mean it's like fate right?

03:42.034 --> 03:45.534
You know two Americans in the
middle of a rave, Germany?

03:46.995 --> 03:49.795
- Do you believe in fate?
- Is that a line?

03:50.223 --> 03:53.168
- That's cold...
- With lines like that you better expect it!

03:53.410 --> 03:55.230
I'm going to start again.

04:00.325 --> 04:02.896
- Oh, hi!
- Hey!

04:02.999 --> 04:04.584
Do you believe in fate?

04:04.654 --> 04:07.726
I guess not, it sort of takes
the fun out of things, you know?

04:07.836 --> 04:09.716
What if it makes it more exciting?

04:09.909 --> 04:12.400
- Are you high?
- No, no, but...

04:12.495 --> 04:16.999
my point is everything that happens,
has already happened. Its fate.

04:17.672 --> 04:20.317
Oh, that's more exciting, because...

04:20.317 --> 04:23.238
You've already given me your phone
number so what is the difference?

04:23.273 --> 04:24.835
I knew it was a line!

04:25.238 --> 04:28.286
It did work better in my head, like the
build up and everything, I don't know.

04:28.287 --> 04:29.334
I admire the ground work.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.611
Thank you, yeah!

04:33.307 --> 04:36.158
- I'm Casey.
- Juliette.

04:36.674 --> 04:38.074
Juliet what?

04:38.915 --> 04:42.415
If it's fate and we slept together
you should know my last name.

04:47.059 --> 04:48.179
What?

04:48.699 --> 04:49.919
Wait!
Hang on!

04:50.262 --> 04:51.938
So what are you doing here?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.563
- What this place?
- In Germany.

04:54.852 --> 04:56.204
You wanna know the truth?

04:56.989 --> 04:58.109
Preferably...

04:59.435 --> 05:02.403
Um, I got into some bad stuff
in the States.

05:02.481 --> 05:05.340
Nothing serious,
just young and stupid and...

05:05.842 --> 05:09.115
decided to use what little money
I had to leave, see the world.

05:09.304 --> 05:11.459
You got to go back?
No.

05:11.552 --> 05:13.249
Nothing to go back to.

05:13.789 --> 05:15.189
How about you?

05:16.414 --> 05:18.398
Ah, originally to study

05:18.479 --> 05:20.600
and get away from my parents.

05:22.522 --> 05:25.146
They did a lot of drugs,

05:25.327 --> 05:27.717
a lot of fighting and not
a lot of being parents.

05:32.544 --> 05:34.364
You um, you still studying?

05:35.308 --> 05:38.074
Not, not sure what I am doing.

05:39.374 --> 05:42.254
Oh, while you're not sure,
you want to spend your time with me?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.421
- With you?
- Yeah!

05:44.503 --> 05:45.623
Well, I um...

05:47.870 --> 05:51.862
I appreciate you asking and you're
cute, nice and everything, but um...

05:53.237 --> 05:56.987
But I've seen you here,
and I know what you're involved in.

05:58.214 --> 06:01.098
I have no objection,
we all like to party.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.395
It's just that in my experience,
guys into that lifestyle...

06:04.481 --> 06:06.629
they're not the guys I'm looking for.

06:08.028 --> 06:11.199
- No, I'm not your typical...
- No, no I...

06:12.202 --> 06:13.202
I don't think you are.

06:13.897 --> 06:18.738
If you ever decide to make that official...
you can let me know.

06:20.356 --> 06:21.300
Wow...

06:26.358 --> 06:29.662
- Anyway, it was nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

06:29.944 --> 06:31.064
See you around.

06:37.671 --> 06:39.267
Party boy!

06:40.432 --> 06:42.926
What's going on?
Stop flirting with those guys.

06:42.989 --> 06:45.262
Seriously, Geran is waiting for us.

06:52.864 --> 06:53.864
Look at this!

06:54.003 --> 06:55.698
You like John Travolta?

06:55.786 --> 06:57.614
Have you seen this movie?
"Perfect"?

06:57.708 --> 07:00.142
With Jamie Lee Curtis,
butt aerobics.

07:01.175 --> 07:02.361
Good film.

07:03.525 --> 07:05.470
Acting not so much but Travolta...

07:05.712 --> 07:07.432
Shit, man!
He should have Oscar.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.342
Who this?

07:13.713 --> 07:15.681
- I'm Casey.
- What?

07:15.833 --> 07:17.806
I've been working for you
for six months.

07:18.041 --> 07:19.161
What?

07:19.908 --> 07:21.028
Casey!

07:22.096 --> 07:24.002
Oh, yeah. Casey!

07:24.159 --> 07:28.518
The drugs they affect my eyes.

07:28.925 --> 07:30.846
He's big time car thief in America.

07:30.987 --> 07:33.080
Tell her how many cars you steal?

07:33.501 --> 07:34.501
I do not know...

07:34.955 --> 07:36.775
I guess it was one too many.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.111
You want to make more?

07:47.580 --> 07:49.438
Yeah.
I need someone like you,

07:49.554 --> 07:51.500
Burt Reynolds, a nobody, but smart.

07:51.503 --> 07:53.440
And someone like you, Grease Lightning,

07:53.557 --> 07:55.047
A nobody, but crazy.

07:56.422 --> 07:58.015
It's time to step up.

07:58.265 --> 08:01.188
- What is it?
- Special job. A lot of money.

08:01.327 --> 08:02.069
You in?

08:02.164 --> 08:02.866
Yeah, we're in.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.313
Hang on, wait, no.
What it is? It is dangerous?

08:05.665 --> 08:07.765
What kind of question is that?

08:08.031 --> 08:09.976
Of course it's dangerous.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.836
Do you want a safe job?

08:11.960 --> 08:13.984
You work at IKEA, don't question me!

08:14.085 --> 08:15.953
If you don't want it, I don't care.

08:16.054 --> 08:18.703
You want to run around collecting
money for me till you get knifed?

08:18.804 --> 08:21.016
That up to you,
I can replace you like that.

08:21.789 --> 08:25.289
I take care about my employees,
offer you something better.

08:26.534 --> 08:27.549
You want it?

08:28.386 --> 08:29.786
Yes or no?

08:36.503 --> 08:38.909
- I just made it official.
- Thank you.

08:39.284 --> 08:39.995
What?

08:40.104 --> 08:42.238
I just make it official,
I quit my job.

08:42.373 --> 08:44.831
Now you have no excuse to not go
on a date with me.

08:44.964 --> 08:46.364
Are you serious?

08:46.429 --> 08:47.549
Completely.

08:48.943 --> 08:50.343
You're crazy.

08:50.513 --> 08:53.544
No, no I'm just a risk taker
and you seem worth the risk.

08:56.897 --> 08:58.975
Come on, just one date,
that's all I'm asking.

09:23.318 --> 09:26.118
You know we've seen each other
every day for the last month.

09:26.201 --> 09:28.301
Yes, I have been following you around.
I'm sorry.

09:40.690 --> 09:42.510
We should move in together.

09:44.331 --> 09:45.451
Cool!

10:21.237 --> 10:22.357
I love you!

10:33.724 --> 10:34.764
Hey.
Hey, how you doing?

10:35.576 --> 10:37.484
Good.
How about you?

10:37.613 --> 10:39.113
I was good.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.773
You want a beer?

10:50.551 --> 10:51.483
You look cute.

10:52.926 --> 10:53.837
Come here.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.613
What have you been doing?

11:03.748 --> 11:05.848
- Missed you.
- Missed you.

11:09.137 --> 11:10.337
So?

11:10.848 --> 11:12.581
So?

11:12.671 --> 11:14.693
I gotta go to work.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.932
- I'm not stopping you.
- You are.

11:19.048 --> 11:20.398
Just a little.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.161
Maybe I can be late.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.157
- Geran.
- Haggen.

11:44.519 --> 11:45.519
Well...

11:45.896 --> 11:48.597
- How's family?
- Good.

11:48.632 --> 11:49.512
Yours?

11:50.217 --> 11:55.687
I... spend more time with horses.
They don't ask for so much.

11:55.764 --> 11:56.764
Yeah.

11:56.808 --> 11:59.738
What do you ask for, Geran?

12:01.412 --> 12:03.987
What do you ask for, from me?

12:05.801 --> 12:07.434
Equal partnership.

12:08.405 --> 12:11.502
- I see.
- We've worked together a long time.

12:11.534 --> 12:13.035
A long time.

12:14.291 --> 12:17.353
- I never cheat you.
- Never once.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.940
I take risks.

12:20.789 --> 12:22.189
Oh, I know.

12:22.597 --> 12:24.999
You take most of the return.

12:25.134 --> 12:26.534
Of course.

12:26.638 --> 12:30.738
I supply the product.
Without which there would be nothing.

12:30.773 --> 12:32.163
I accept it.
I accept it

12:32.939 --> 12:33.873
Good.

12:36.108 --> 12:37.278
Good.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.691
From a business point of view, Geran.

12:40.524 --> 12:46.716
Where is the leverage on me
to give you, what you ask for?

12:46.885 --> 12:50.212
Point of view of fairness.

12:50.938 --> 12:54.685
This must be an appeal to
my better nature.

12:54.720 --> 12:55.815
Is that is bad?

12:55.866 --> 13:00.000
It is a bit of a surprise,
as a way of asking for more money.

13:00.001 --> 13:03.022
No. Not about money.

13:03.622 --> 13:07.154
- Partnership is respect.
- Yeah.

13:07.196 --> 13:11.286
It's me in my place, you in yours.
My kind, keep us in our place.

13:11.664 --> 13:14.098
I know you'll say no, absolutely.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.220
I know it.

13:18.577 --> 13:21.510
But I have to ask.

13:21.939 --> 13:23.006
I have to hear it.

13:28.646 --> 13:32.693
Geran, the work you do,
the risks you take,

13:32.829 --> 13:37.323
entitles to at least half of
what we earn together.

13:38.395 --> 13:41.646
But the person you are compared
to the person I am

13:41.982 --> 13:46.415
compels me to, reject,
to refuse what you ask for.

13:46.986 --> 13:50.386
It is a question of character,
of refinement,

13:50.884 --> 13:52.652
of value, of virtue,

13:52.661 --> 13:55.723
of which you know nothing.

13:56.197 --> 13:59.706
Be comfortable in your place,
in life, Geran.

14:00.335 --> 14:02.302
It suits you well.

14:03.633 --> 14:08.785
But you would never be an
equal partner with me,

14:09.790 --> 14:13.641
in any sense of the word.

14:27.243 --> 14:28.876
Look at these people.

14:29.384 --> 14:33.502
They're in their own little holidays,
thinking this will go on forever.

14:33.538 --> 14:36.072
- What's forever?
- Nothing.

14:36.107 --> 14:37.399
That is the point.

14:39.230 --> 14:43.587
Let’s go upstairs, get warm,
have a cuddle, maybe have sex.

14:43.622 --> 14:45.892
You're so romantic.

14:48.751 --> 14:53.157
I am a lucky, lucky girl.
To you!

14:53.474 --> 14:59.225
Since you walked away from that
crazy, crazy Turkish psychopath.

14:59.997 --> 15:01.950
I'm proud of you, Casey Stein.

15:02.438 --> 15:03.753
It worked out okay.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.240
Okay, the challenge is...

15:06.573 --> 15:09.641
We strip to our underwear,
we get in the snow...

15:09.676 --> 15:14.133
First one to get up four fingers of
schnapps straight out of the bottle,

15:14.134 --> 15:16.711
walks around the block, naked.

15:17.051 --> 15:20.037
- Can I keep my socks on?
- No!

15:21.910 --> 15:25.977
- Alright whatever. Lets do it.
- Naked! Now!

15:28.120 --> 15:29.920
Everything off, okay?

15:30.368 --> 15:33.068
It's too cold,
I'm keeping my shorts on.

15:36.183 --> 15:38.578
Three, two, one!

15:38.634 --> 15:39.614
Go...!

15:42.866 --> 15:44.633
It's so cold!

15:50.231 --> 15:52.002
It went alright. Let's go!

15:54.022 --> 15:57.048
Jules? Baby come on!

15:57.556 --> 15:58.856
Jules?

16:02.051 --> 16:04.990
What happened?
Hey... Jules?

16:21.876 --> 16:24.041
And now we've got the
blood pressure under control,

16:24.042 --> 16:26.483
there should be no
further risk of seizures.

16:28.787 --> 16:32.316
We must prepare to address
the underlying condition.

16:33.846 --> 16:36.272
I'm sorry, but I will be honest.

16:37.965 --> 16:40.131
Your status in this country does

16:40.217 --> 16:43.920
not entitle you to a place
on the required program.

16:46.284 --> 16:50.708
Obviously, you will not be
denied Haemodialysis, but um...

16:50.787 --> 16:55.609
Hang on, I'm sorry. You're
saying she's going to need dialysis?

16:55.783 --> 16:57.316
Yes, of course.

16:58.115 --> 17:03.148
Well, ultimately a kidney
transplant is the only solution.

17:03.396 --> 17:08.195
And time is of the essence,
but we cannot help you, I'm sorry.

17:11.315 --> 17:14.549
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What's the point?

17:14.647 --> 17:17.900
You heard what she said, I need a
transplant that they won't give me.

17:17.901 --> 17:21.643
What’s the point? Come on, you're my
best friend, you know everything about me.

17:21.657 --> 17:23.925
Can you imagine how
it makes me feel?

17:25.242 --> 17:26.509
How you feel?

17:57.465 --> 17:58.565
Stop!

18:52.485 --> 18:53.759
Okay?!

19:25.575 --> 19:29.642
Shit, I almost shot you
through the door!

19:31.257 --> 19:36.397
You, Burt Reynolds.
You have come back!

19:36.432 --> 19:37.936
I knew it.

19:38.857 --> 19:40.257
Hey. Come in.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.262
How about the door?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.443
You look tense.

20:08.528 --> 20:10.221
You want woman?

20:10.976 --> 20:13.758
Champagne, cocaine, viagra,
take what you want.

20:13.793 --> 20:15.309
I just need to make some money.

20:17.929 --> 20:21.321
That's why were all here,
to make money.

20:22.335 --> 20:25.571
That's why I own race horses,
and hookers.

20:27.784 --> 20:30.646
You know the difference between
a race horse and hooker?

20:33.152 --> 20:37.080
Me neither.
You want to find out?

20:37.452 --> 20:38.152
Boo!

20:43.469 --> 20:44.609
Bye, bye.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.134
Ciao! Bye bye!

21:03.674 --> 21:06.674
- Hagen Kahl, have you heard of him?
- No!

21:06.688 --> 21:08.088
Okay.

21:08.093 --> 21:09.576
Number one business man.

21:10.700 --> 21:15.206
Hagen Kahl Logistics, is completely legal,
reliable, efficient, trustworthy.

21:15.216 --> 21:16.808
All that German shit.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.765
Second, security.

21:18.900 --> 21:22.891
This one not quite so legal, I mean,
everyone man got to watch his assets,

21:22.926 --> 21:25.060
but this Hagen Khal, has got an army.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.983
Three, drugs.

21:28.593 --> 21:31.337
Which of course is not legal at all.

21:31.855 --> 21:35.466
So once every six months.

21:35.716 --> 21:40.522
A truck traveling from docks
at Rotterdam to Cologne.

21:40.557 --> 21:43.328
Trucks carrying 4,000 cubic
feet of golf balls.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.930
Packed with cocaine all
the way from Chile.

21:46.411 --> 21:50.581
Yeah, so the cargo is delivered
to one of Hagen's depots.

21:50.806 --> 21:52.523
And they empty them in the warehouse.

21:53.115 --> 21:56.125
He hands the product off to
Geran for distribution.

21:56.126 --> 22:00.359
Geran gives back the takings
in 500 EURO notes.

22:00.771 --> 22:02.471
You know, easy to move.

22:03.118 --> 22:07.339
Finally Hagen packs the money into
the bodies of high end luxury cars.

22:07.528 --> 22:08.894
5 million in each car.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.968
Then export them onto ships,
ships go back to Chile,

22:12.969 --> 22:14.707
the cycle is complete.

22:14.841 --> 22:16.373
Pretty good setup right?

22:16.541 --> 22:20.095
He's business man. Raised in
England and German blood line,

22:20.100 --> 22:24.066
family man, philanthropist,
drug trafficker and killer.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.798
Don't you forget that!

22:26.261 --> 22:30.093
Now, the same guy drive truck,
every time.

22:30.665 --> 22:32.898
Doesn't drink or smoke or do drugs.

22:32.947 --> 22:34.786
Clean record, guy is like pope.

22:35.292 --> 22:36.730
No sleep for 8 hours, boom!

22:37.203 --> 22:38.670
No stop to piss.

22:38.781 --> 22:41.000
Always on time.
Guy is psychopath.

22:41.035 --> 22:42.684
Like driving terminator.

22:43.632 --> 22:45.430
Top of truck mounted camera.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.766
GPS device.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.948
So I need someone like you,
Burt Reynolds,

22:56.635 --> 22:57.838
a nobody but smart.

22:57.891 --> 23:00.433
And you Chris Lightning,
a nobody but crazy.

23:00.867 --> 23:04.700
You figure out a way to steal truck.
Burt Reynolds. You bring it to me.

23:04.763 --> 23:06.430
Then you make your money.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.665
$250,000 each.

23:11.590 --> 23:12.790
Now you tell me...

23:13.415 --> 23:16.715
Are you the racehorse
or are you a hooker?

23:29.962 --> 23:33.200
Listen, I think there is a way.

23:33.201 --> 23:35.001
What do you mean?

23:35.048 --> 23:38.881
If we go back to the States,
pay for the transplant ourselves.

23:38.946 --> 23:40.386
You don't think I thought of that?

23:41.539 --> 23:42.906
It's nearly $200,000.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.514
We can barely even cover our rent.

23:45.691 --> 23:50.424
Yeah, I stop working at the site
and go back to what I was doing.

23:50.432 --> 23:52.499
Earn some serious money.

23:54.134 --> 23:55.534
Serious money?

23:57.255 --> 24:00.788
What you gonna do?
Rob all the casinos in Vegas?

24:00.941 --> 24:03.076
One night of glorious mayhem?

24:03.077 --> 24:05.902
There is a way to get the money.
I can do it.

24:06.214 --> 24:09.347
And I can look after myself too,
but no offense.

24:09.707 --> 24:12.161
I did it for a long time
before you came along.

24:12.838 --> 24:15.147
Okay, I just get back
to working for Geran,

24:15.148 --> 24:17.021
make some good money,
some serious money and then...

24:17.063 --> 24:18.463
No, Casey, I...

24:19.717 --> 24:21.467
No, I don't want you to
do that for me.

24:30.091 --> 24:33.288
You're all that I got, okay?

24:34.666 --> 24:36.874
All I'm trying to do is protect you.

24:47.387 --> 24:49.303
Promise me you’re not going to do it?

24:57.010 --> 24:58.246
Okay.

24:59.318 --> 25:00.220
Snake bite...

25:00.600 --> 25:03.196
Two parts of Jack Daniels and tequila,
one part tabasco.

25:04.762 --> 25:07.296
T, please, hey T, please,
this is serious.

25:07.345 --> 25:09.366
I am serious, I worked all week,
and it's my day off.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.498
And we've gone over this 100 times.
I need a drink.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.875
Yes, I know. We need to focus for two
minutes and then we can drink.

25:13.908 --> 25:15.851
I'm focused, eye of the tiger.

25:15.910 --> 25:18.338
So we hit the truck here outside
of Austim like we talked about...

25:18.405 --> 25:20.705
- What is that?
- Really?

25:21.089 --> 25:23.311
The lighter is the bike,
the glass is the car.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.573
We crash the bike into the car and
make it look like an accident.

25:25.574 --> 25:27.807
When the truck stops,
the driver will get out

25:27.890 --> 25:29.665
- and that's our opportunity.
- I got it.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.631
Alright, then I'll remove the tracker
and you handle the driver.

25:36.308 --> 25:39.541
Shit, these guys, man, I tell you,
they soak up the pressure.

25:40.204 --> 25:42.004
They hit you with the counterattack,
always one step ahead.

25:42.336 --> 25:46.136
That's why they're going to win the League,
that's why they get paid.

25:47.393 --> 25:49.260
What? I got money on this game.

25:52.233 --> 25:54.033
It was something you said.

25:54.175 --> 25:55.308
I said a lot of things.

25:55.332 --> 25:58.314
Yes but, soaking up the pressure,
you know, being one step ahead.

26:03.078 --> 26:04.460
We need a counter attack.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.978
Thanks.

26:59.486 --> 27:01.105
You told me that if you died...

27:01.700 --> 27:04.538
You want me to move on and
forget about you.

27:06.078 --> 27:08.358
Well, I can't do that.

27:09.715 --> 27:13.582
It's like your laying down to die,
and that's not us.

27:14.210 --> 27:18.110
We got to keep moving,
we got to do whatever it takes.

28:33.547 --> 28:34.947
Come on, lets go!

28:35.916 --> 28:37.749
- Got it? Got it?
- Yeah!

28:47.679 --> 28:50.179
Come on! Come on!

30:03.289 --> 30:05.889
Come on! Come on!
Please! Please!

31:44.401 --> 31:45.701
- You okay?
- Yeah!

31:46.392 --> 31:48.025
Hey. We said no guns.

31:48.290 --> 31:50.457
You said no guns.

32:54.032 --> 32:56.599
Okay, stick with me till the lake,
and there's the tracker.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.233
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah, you too!

35:52.939 --> 35:55.439
Hey, you're not picking up!
You're not picking up!

35:55.459 --> 35:58.059
What's going on, where are you?
We got to meet Geran in an hour.

35:58.061 --> 36:02.527
Call me back now, I'm at the spot.
Now! Shesh!

36:38.900 --> 36:39.906
Good morning.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.631
You know, on the rare occasions
when people like you.

36:43.935 --> 36:48.435
try to steal from me, I'll take what
is mine, but I find myself being

36:48.515 --> 36:53.448
weirdly drawn to them. Wondering
who this foolish man can possibly be?

36:53.659 --> 36:55.709
And who on earth would
have put him up to it?

36:56.802 --> 36:57.902
I wonder?

37:01.998 --> 37:05.432
What I do know about you is that you're
an American, because my friends here

37:05.467 --> 37:08.300
tell me that you were talking
while you were unconscious,

37:08.335 --> 37:10.829
which of course is
typically American, isn't it?

37:10.975 --> 37:15.300
And judging by your stubborn refusal to
talk right now while you are fully concious,

37:15.335 --> 37:17.694
well, I guess that must make you

37:17.752 --> 37:21.152
either an extremely brave American or

37:21.852 --> 37:25.908
excessively stupid American.
I don't know, you tell me! Yeah.

37:27.547 --> 37:31.980
But you and I so surely we can cut
through all that boring back and forth

37:32.015 --> 37:35.004
Sylvester Stallone nonsense
"Eh ah Adreine" you know.

37:35.431 --> 37:38.831
You just give me the name or the names
of the comedians who set you up for this...

37:38.900 --> 37:41.443
most idiotic caper.

37:41.471 --> 37:44.345
It was me.
Ah, it was my idea.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.978
I want you to know right now, sir,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.830
that I don't for one moment condemn
you for what you have done, not at all.

37:51.101 --> 37:56.634
'Cause our line of work is quite brutal
and quite ruthless, isn't it, yeah.

37:57.732 --> 38:02.899
You and I would never set ourselves up
to present our resumes, would we, no!

38:03.047 --> 38:09.914
We clawed, kicked and fought our
way to the top didn't we?

38:11.147 --> 38:13.731
Welcome to the big fat
stupid meaningless world

38:13.732 --> 38:16.256
in which we all live,
move and have our being.

38:16.291 --> 38:19.516
But no one gives a shit, and maybe
because that's the way it is, bro!

38:19.553 --> 38:22.353
It always has been and always will be,
world without end.

38:22.398 --> 38:25.298
Amen. Hallelujah!

38:25.734 --> 38:27.999
Brave New World!

38:29.169 --> 38:30.469
Yeah.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.988
You people!

38:33.720 --> 38:35.187
You know nothing.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.810
Oh, by the way, before I forget,

38:40.811 --> 38:43.326
you must drink plenty of water
when you start talking,

38:43.361 --> 38:44.256
which you will do of course

38:44.257 --> 38:48.869
because your mouth will become exceedingly
dry and parched from fear, you understand?

38:49.004 --> 38:50.172
What was I going to tell you?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.130
Oh yes, that's right, my father...

38:53.700 --> 38:58.143
My father was quite an notorious
interrogation officer during the war.

38:58.222 --> 39:00.955
One very hot Wednesday afternoon,

39:02.194 --> 39:04.128
July 21, 1944, no,

39:06.689 --> 39:08.456
it wasn't, it was in '43.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.386
God, I've always hated Wednesdays.

39:16.691 --> 39:21.425
Yeah, I remember that I was...
I was hiding in my father's study.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.920
I must have been playing hide and
seek with my little sister, you know?

39:25.950 --> 39:29.583
And suddenly I discovered this
briefcase, my father's briefcase,

39:29.768 --> 39:32.710
crammed with photographs of
my father's methods of interrogation.

39:32.711 --> 39:34.227
They were horrible, disgusting.

39:34.262 --> 39:37.395
My father was a horrible,
disgusting and evil,

39:37.409 --> 39:39.042
efficient beast!

39:40.176 --> 39:42.743
An appalling sense of duty.

39:43.463 --> 39:47.730
People who knew my father
respects him, feared him.

39:47.883 --> 39:50.683
I hated my father and I loathed him.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.960
After he was dead, I pissed all
over his grave. Pissed all over it!

39:55.000 --> 39:58.442
So all of a sudden I'm not my
father's son, but not in that respect.

39:58.524 --> 40:02.358
I hate painful coercion,
I hate torture, but...

40:02.434 --> 40:04.434
I leave that to my friends here.

40:04.701 --> 40:07.434
All I do is deliver the final
'coup de grâce'.

40:07.436 --> 40:09.203
Or is it, "Coup De Grâce"

40:12.759 --> 40:15.359
Hey there, I must fly myself. Mitch.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.071
Thank you.

40:18.876 --> 40:24.903
I have my wife's birthday party
to attend to, you know?

40:25.510 --> 40:29.800
And... my three beautiful daughters,
they would severely...

40:29.835 --> 40:31.400
chastise me!!

40:33.489 --> 40:36.156
You know what women like, don't you?

40:36.791 --> 40:40.425
So I'll leave you in good hands, okay?

40:41.414 --> 40:42.914
Ciao!

40:43.000 --> 40:47.502
Oh, one other thing, I noticed on your
wrist band the name Juliette Marne.

40:47.900 --> 40:51.258
They tell me that you were calling
her while you were unconscious.

40:51.263 --> 40:53.863
Leave her out of this. I promise
she has nothing to do with it.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.552
Americans are extraordinary.
Must be all that psychoanalysis.

40:56.576 --> 40:58.915
Maybe I should have it, oh,
am I too screwed up for it?

40:59.642 --> 41:04.257
So anyway, if you don't give us
the information we need...

41:05.819 --> 41:07.710
I'm sure she will.

41:07.711 --> 41:09.527
Auf wiedersehen, my friend.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.061
Hey, I've got what you need, wait!

43:30.857 --> 43:32.357
- Hey!
- Hey!

43:32.407 --> 43:34.052
What's going on?
Are you okay?

43:34.195 --> 43:36.396
Yeah, I'm okay, just got caught up.

43:36.439 --> 43:38.866
Where were you last night?

43:39.182 --> 43:41.271
I was just out with Matthias.

43:41.809 --> 43:45.293
But Casey, you promised me you
weren't going to go back to that.

43:45.328 --> 43:47.532
Yeah, I know, I know, it's not
what you think. Okay.

43:47.567 --> 43:49.465
Hey, I was thinking we should
get out of town for a while.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.151
Just you and me,
away to take a break.

43:51.317 --> 43:53.429
Look, I saw the letter, I...

43:53.564 --> 43:55.224
I just...

43:55.335 --> 43:57.819
I don't need all this
shit right now, okay?

43:58.123 --> 44:00.506
You know what day it is today, yeah?

44:00.541 --> 44:01.562
Yeah, I know, look...

44:01.597 --> 44:03.581
- I'm coming home and...
- No!

44:03.616 --> 44:04.908
I can’t do this right now, okay?

44:04.943 --> 44:06.720
Jules look, I'm sorry.

44:06.829 --> 44:09.069
I'll be home soon. Please,
please, just wait for me, okay?

44:09.104 --> 44:10.009
I gotta to go.

44:10.044 --> 44:12.231
Jules?

44:12.260 --> 44:13.394
Hey, Jules?

44:36.953 --> 44:39.286
Hey, this is Juliette, leave a message.

44:40.626 --> 44:44.292
I'm coming to get you, please,
just stay there, okay?

47:44.761 --> 47:46.315
Hey, move!

50:21.500 --> 50:24.264
That guy is trying to kill me.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun!

51:08.274 --> 51:09.862
Where were you?
You okay?

51:10.197 --> 51:11.933
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

51:11.968 --> 51:15.223
Listen, listen, I need you to
do something for me.

51:15.258 --> 51:16.293
Juliette is in trouble.

51:16.499 --> 51:18.366
- What?
- She's in trouble.

51:18.416 --> 51:20.137
She's at the hospital,
but she's heading home.

51:20.172 --> 51:21.659
I need you to get her out
of the apartment.

51:21.683 --> 51:23.284
I will, what should I say?

51:23.670 --> 51:26.311
I don't know, just take her for coffee,
say you want to see a movie, whatever!

51:26.699 --> 51:29.499
Movie? Why the hell is she going
to go to a movie with me?

51:29.630 --> 51:31.665
I do not know, T,
just get her out of the apartment!

51:31.957 --> 51:33.357
Okay, okay, okay.

52:34.385 --> 52:35.386
Hello?

52:35.534 --> 52:40.111
If it's the story of Muarue,
then Juliette and her Romeo.

52:40.399 --> 52:42.423
That's William Shakespeare, brutal.

52:42.458 --> 52:46.950
Many innocent characters of his died
violent and meaningless deaths like

52:46.985 --> 52:50.872
Juliette and her Romeo.
Poor Casey Stein.

52:51.106 --> 52:52.594
Lovers address,

52:52.886 --> 52:57.456
is Kaiser Strasse 237, apartment 12B.

52:57.726 --> 52:59.612
Yeah, that's it, 12B.

52:59.647 --> 53:01.081
You can have it back.

53:01.105 --> 53:02.931
Tell me where,
I'll drop the money, all of it!

53:03.161 --> 53:04.715
Just please leave her out of this.

53:04.808 --> 53:09.070
Run, little piggy, run, run.
Run, little piggy, run, run, run.

53:23.566 --> 53:25.900
Okay, this is Juliette, leave a message!

53:28.529 --> 53:31.263
Jules, come on, you
need to answer your phone!

53:32.743 --> 53:36.866
I'm sorry, I get that you're mad, but I'm
begging you, please, get out of the house!

53:38.565 --> 53:41.966
I love you so much,
just please listen to me, okay!

53:49.128 --> 53:50.628
Answer the phone!!

53:51.173 --> 53:53.414
You better talk, you bastard!
Talk!

53:53.449 --> 53:55.399
Hey Geran, yeah,
I know we messed up.

53:55.476 --> 53:57.476
You sell me out?
You sell me out?

53:57.495 --> 53:59.363
No, no, I didn't give you up!
I didn't say anything.

53:59.403 --> 54:02.412
It went wrong,
but I busted out and stole a car.

54:02.447 --> 54:03.904
It was one of Hagen's drop cars, okay?

54:03.939 --> 54:05.882
It had money in it,
lots of money!

54:05.885 --> 54:07.486
When you say lots, how much?

54:07.632 --> 54:09.665
It's like $5 million in each car, right?

54:10.045 --> 54:14.857
And Geran, look, I need $200,000.
The rest is yours, all of it.

54:14.892 --> 54:15.800
But you need to do something for me.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.586
Do what?

54:17.598 --> 54:19.883
I need you to protect my girlfriend,
Juliette Marne.

54:19.918 --> 54:24.269
Okay? She's at
Kaiser Strasse 237, apartment 12B.

54:24.304 --> 54:26.377
- Get her out of there.
- Is that all?

01:01:16.564 --> 01:01:18.614
Oh, come on!

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:21.572
Yo, this is Matthias.
Drop it like it's hot!

01:01:22.014 --> 01:01:25.782
Matthias, I need to know what's going on.
Did you get Juliette?

01:01:26.255 --> 01:01:28.155
Hey it's Casey, leave a message.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:31.461
Casey, I don't know how to say
this, man, but she's not there.

01:01:31.686 --> 01:01:32.887
Just let me know she is safe.

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.116
I think someone got to her first.
Call me back, okay?

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:35.840
Call me back!

01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:19.473
On three.

01:02:24.381 --> 01:02:27.842
It's too much? You can keep
the change, okay? Keep it.

01:02:29.584 --> 01:02:32.327
Come on. Come on, you can see
I'm in a mess here.

01:02:32.588 --> 01:02:34.455
I need your help, I screwed up.

01:02:37.524 --> 01:02:39.624
I really screwed this up!

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:45.559
I was trying to do the right
thing for her, but it was stupid.

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:47.100
Tried to do it again.

01:02:48.256 --> 01:02:52.224
I mean, she told me... she told me
not to do this and I promised and,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:57.621
now I might have gotten her killed.

01:02:59.494 --> 01:03:02.561
I know you don't know me,
but I'm not a bad guy.

01:03:03.135 --> 01:03:04.867
But the people chasing me,

01:03:04.902 --> 01:03:07.772
they are going to kill the love of my life
if I don't get to Cologne in time.

01:03:07.892 --> 01:03:10.293
Give me that gas and let
me drive out of here,

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:13.369
I'll be the luckiest guy alive.

01:03:13.729 --> 01:03:17.476
You don't...
I probably deserve that too.

01:03:18.385 --> 01:03:20.742
I do, but she doesn't, okay?

01:03:21.095 --> 01:03:23.488
She doesn't deserve any of this.

01:03:35.003 --> 01:03:37.230
Thank you! You are a god damn...

01:03:37.265 --> 01:03:39.853
I want to kiss you but I won't,
you know you are a Saint, thank you!

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:06.207
Hey, easy!
Easy!

01:04:12.008 --> 01:04:13.268
I don't know what you are saying.

01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:16.312
Get down, get down!

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.475
I don't know what you are saying.

01:04:40.565 --> 01:04:42.316
You okay?
Ja, ja!

01:04:45.512 --> 01:04:49.013
Look, you don't want to... You don't want
to get involved with these guys, okay?

01:04:49.117 --> 01:04:51.393
Just put it down.
Put it down. Please.

01:04:51.428 --> 01:04:52.926
You have to get out of here.
Let them go.

01:05:02.802 --> 01:05:04.002
What's your name?

01:05:04.908 --> 01:05:06.776
Hey, please stay out of this.

01:05:07.406 --> 01:05:08.782
He has already made his choice.

01:05:09.845 --> 01:05:10.972
Name please?

01:05:11.898 --> 01:05:12.843
Wolfgang.

01:05:13.227 --> 01:05:17.558
Sorry, a little louder, I'm a little hard
of hearing. It's my age, you understand.

01:05:17.932 --> 01:05:19.475
My name is Wolfgang.

01:05:19.765 --> 01:05:20.872
Wolfgang?

01:05:22.148 --> 01:05:26.907
You mean after Amadeus Mozart?
Wow!

01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:31.346
Do you speak English, Wolfgang?

01:05:32.322 --> 01:05:34.057
Don't play his games, don't.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:38.289
Please, I'm talking to my friend, Wolfgang.

01:05:38.324 --> 01:05:39.662
Sorry, Wolfy.

01:05:40.934 --> 01:05:43.078
Do you speak the English?

01:05:43.638 --> 01:05:44.832
A little bit.

01:05:45.244 --> 01:05:46.512
That's good, that is very good.

01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:48.505
Therefore I will speak slowly.

01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:51.035
Do you like Mozart, Wolfgang?

01:05:51.787 --> 01:05:53.434
- Sure.
- Good.

01:05:53.656 --> 01:05:55.390
You'll be meeting him soon.

01:05:55.681 --> 01:05:58.533
Listen I've been hunting deer
since I was 12,

01:05:58.568 --> 01:06:01.026
and they are five times faster than you.

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.743
And I very rarely miss.

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.963
And from this range I barely have to aim.

01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:07.597
And I'll blow your head from
here to Düsseldorf.

01:06:12.254 --> 01:06:13.754
It wasn't a discussion.

01:06:16.648 --> 01:06:17.948
Now it is his time.

01:06:19.965 --> 01:06:21.632
The painless coup de gras.

01:06:26.342 --> 01:06:27.546
Well...

01:06:28.965 --> 01:06:31.766
Obviously I've misjudged you, my friend.

01:06:32.384 --> 01:06:37.252
In my experience, people who are
about to die, usually cry,

01:06:37.644 --> 01:06:39.788
or pray or beg a little.

01:06:41.652 --> 01:06:44.843
But laughing a little, well,
that is original.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:49.706
You really are quite an exceptional
young man, aren’t you!

01:06:50.643 --> 01:06:52.731
You don't see it, do you?

01:06:54.397 --> 01:06:55.397
No...!

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:58.665
Enlighten me, please.

01:06:59.191 --> 01:07:02.726
I mean, you think with all your money,
you are somehow better than me.

01:07:03.736 --> 01:07:05.905
That you are safe and in control.

01:07:07.287 --> 01:07:08.793
But you are not...

01:07:11.497 --> 01:07:12.964
I'm in control.

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:15.748
Because I still got your truck.

01:07:17.338 --> 01:07:20.206
So you should think about making a deal.

01:08:12.169 --> 01:08:13.635
- Burt Reynolds...
- Did you get her?

01:08:13.898 --> 01:08:15.866
- Who?
- You know who, Juliette.

01:08:16.075 --> 01:08:17.075
Juliette!

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:23.644
- No. No. We were too late.
- What do you mean you were too late?

01:08:27.174 --> 01:08:29.140
Someone just got there before us.

01:08:29.755 --> 01:08:32.165
She's dead, I am sorry my friend.

01:08:49.657 --> 01:08:52.108
I mess with you...
I mess with you.

01:08:52.764 --> 01:08:55.995
We got her! We got her!
Oh man, your face...

01:08:56.225 --> 01:09:01.292
I wish I could see it.
She here, relax! She's here.

01:09:01.496 --> 01:09:03.830
I'm confused. She's there?
You got her? She is alive?

01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.687
My men just pick her up,
she's on her way.

01:09:06.721 --> 01:09:08.697
Come here to race track.

01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:10.732
Yeah, okay, I'm on my way.

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:12.818
- Bring the money, okay?
- Yeah, I got the money. I got the money.

01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:14.591
I have to warn you.

01:09:14.986 --> 01:09:18.596
From what I hear,
she's pretty pissed with you.

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:18.198
Shake me, Burt Reynolds!

01:10:18.984 --> 01:10:20.717
You give me heart attack!

01:10:21.924 --> 01:10:23.393
Next time I shoot you.

01:10:23.707 --> 01:10:24.707
Where is she?

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:31.527
Where is she?

01:10:35.514 --> 01:10:36.514
You don't see it?

01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:38.391
Where, see what?

01:10:38.704 --> 01:10:41.746
- You man, you.
- What?

01:10:42.181 --> 01:10:44.739
You look like a Burt Reynolds.

01:10:46.895 --> 01:10:51.417
Fine, you've got her, right?
She's here?

01:10:51.475 --> 01:10:53.442
It's compliment.
You're very handsome man.

01:10:53.946 --> 01:10:56.114
Well, now not so much,
geeze, you know.

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:58.643
Now you look like "manikin".

01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:04.924
But then, Alai’im, like a statue,
in 'Deliverance' his body.

01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:08.684
You could light a match off it!

01:11:12.895 --> 01:11:16.269
I just need to see her.
I just need to see her.

01:11:18.459 --> 01:11:20.410
I fuck love Burt Reynolds.

01:11:24.206 --> 01:11:25.273
Lets walk!

01:11:41.677 --> 01:11:45.603
You say anything to Hagen Kahl
about me that I plan all this?

01:11:45.866 --> 01:11:46.866
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:49.223
No, nothing!
And where is she?

01:11:49.769 --> 01:11:54.036
Oh, I love this song...

01:11:55.597 --> 01:11:56.697
Beautiful...

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.480
Hey, hey, Geran!

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:18.835
No, no, no, no, It's me,
it's me, Burt Reynolds.

01:12:21.862 --> 01:12:25.231
Burt Reynolds, what did I say?

01:12:25.266 --> 01:12:26.587
No sudden moves.

01:12:26.946 --> 01:12:27.847
I'm sorry, yeah!

01:12:27.878 --> 01:12:30.344
Please, the drugs are strong today!

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:37.450
Jesus!

01:12:57.423 --> 01:12:59.723
- Geran... Geran!
- Yeah!

01:13:00.349 --> 01:13:02.015
- That's not her!
- What?

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.696
You got the wrong woman!

01:13:03.753 --> 01:13:05.953
Hey, stay cool man!
I did as you asked.

01:13:05.964 --> 01:13:09.295
I picked her up from
Kaiser Strasse 237, Apartment 12D!

01:13:09.781 --> 01:13:10.781
- B!
- What?

01:13:10.959 --> 01:13:11.860
Apartment 12B.

01:13:11.877 --> 01:13:13.477
- Not D?
- No!

01:13:13.511 --> 01:13:16.279
Ah... that explains everything.
No wonder she did not want to come.

01:13:16.574 --> 01:13:18.140
She can go!
She can go!!

01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:19.474
You stupid asshole!

01:13:19.876 --> 01:13:21.240
If anything has happened to her...

01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:22.923
- I swear I'm going to...
- Do what?!

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:29.876
I ask you, Burt Reynolds.
Do what?

01:13:50.867 --> 01:13:51.837
Where's the truck?

01:13:57.662 --> 01:13:59.600
Tell me where the damn truck is!

01:14:07.427 --> 01:14:08.928
No.

01:15:46.338 --> 01:15:48.311
Oh my god!

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:38.984
Hello?

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:42.666
I believe I have something
you want Mr. Stein.

01:16:44.047 --> 01:16:47.215
Please, please don't hurt her.
She's got nothing to do with this.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.168
- Then give me what is mine!
- Okay, okay, but...

01:16:51.596 --> 01:16:54.663
We do it on my terms.
We meet at the Stiefe Bar in Cologne.

01:16:54.696 --> 01:16:57.063
And put her on the phone.
I want to know she is okay.

01:18:07.645 --> 01:18:09.010
Oh my god!

01:18:10.658 --> 01:18:11.846
Are you okay?

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:16.972
He's here, Hagen is here.

01:18:17.312 --> 01:18:20.506
Now the day is over,
the night is drawing nigh,

01:18:20.619 --> 01:18:25.386
the shadows of the evening
steal across the sky.

01:18:27.432 --> 01:18:29.300
What a day it has been, Mr. Stein.

01:18:29.487 --> 01:18:30.954
What a beautiful day.

01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:34.428
I see you brought the money!

01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:44.745
Open the case.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:55.005
Yep, all seems to be in order.

01:18:55.447 --> 01:18:57.911
Shut the case.
Step back.

01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:04.459
By the way, I heard about her illness,

01:19:04.494 --> 01:19:08.457
and your gallant and chivalrous
desire to save her life.

01:19:08.474 --> 01:19:10.408
I was most moved.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:13.835
Incidentally you're free
to go, Miss. Marne.

01:19:14.023 --> 01:19:15.761
You, on the other hand, Casey,

01:19:15.762 --> 01:19:19.217
I need you to stay so we can
sort out this truck business.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.130
Hello, Geran.

01:19:34.411 --> 01:19:36.011
I need drink.

01:19:39.183 --> 01:19:42.575
Will somebody get me a drink
before I die of thirst?

01:20:02.289 --> 01:20:03.589
That's...

01:20:07.161 --> 01:20:08.461
That's nice!

01:20:19.183 --> 01:20:20.183
Now...

01:20:22.473 --> 01:20:29.098
You think I loud, brash, disgusting,

01:20:29.133 --> 01:20:31.546
got no manners?
Maybe, yes!

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:38.954
But I do have heart and
that heart was sliced in two

01:20:39.754 --> 01:20:42.374
when you refused me
equal partnership.

01:20:56.946 --> 01:21:00.869
I take it you set up this
little circus, Mr. Stein?

01:21:00.904 --> 01:21:02.505
Yeah, it was me.

01:21:04.203 --> 01:21:06.943
So you gave yourself up
to save her life.

01:21:08.494 --> 01:21:09.995
That is most interesting.

01:21:10.128 --> 01:21:13.472
No, I'm not leaving you. Look, you've
got the money. You've got the money.

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:14.682
Why are you doing this?

01:21:14.863 --> 01:21:19.911
Why? Because I chose to.
It's all in the game, Miss Marne.

01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:25.255
Call it the Trinity game.

01:21:25.471 --> 01:21:31.755
This man said, I am become Death,
destroyer of worlds.

01:21:33.176 --> 01:21:34.277
That simple.

01:21:46.929 --> 01:21:48.329
Go! Go!

01:22:12.381 --> 01:22:13.781
Wretches!

01:22:43.561 --> 01:22:45.128
Hey...
Stop right there.

01:22:55.159 --> 01:22:57.259
What the hell is going on, Casey?

01:23:00.405 --> 01:23:01.580
Geran offered me and Matthias

01:23:01.581 --> 01:23:04.100
money to steal a truck from
this gangster that had golf balls

01:23:04.157 --> 01:23:05.556
full of cocaine in it.

01:23:05.645 --> 01:23:06.991
- What?
- I wanted the money for you,

01:23:07.026 --> 01:23:08.156
to make you better. But...

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:10.705
It went bad, I got caught
and they tortured me and...

01:23:10.892 --> 01:23:12.771
- Casey...
- I broke out and stole a car,

01:23:12.772 --> 01:23:14.809
there was 5 million euros inside.

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:16.592
- In there?
- Yeah!

01:23:16.716 --> 01:23:17.441
Jesus!

01:23:17.442 --> 01:23:20.417
Hey, look, I just wanted to
give you the life you deserve.

01:23:20.594 --> 01:23:21.309
What?

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:31.735
If I stuck a pair of tights over
my head and robbed a bank,

01:23:31.736 --> 01:23:32.809
you'd think is was a dumb idea!

01:23:32.844 --> 01:23:34.262
Yeah, yes of course, I know!

01:23:34.297 --> 01:23:38.445
But I had to think some people may
think what I did was like... romantic.

01:23:38.819 --> 01:23:40.886
- Romantic?
- Yeah.

01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:44.030
- Well, it's kinda romantic.
- Thank you!

01:23:54.650 --> 01:23:56.050
Wait...
Wait!

01:23:57.537 --> 01:23:58.872
Take the money.
I'll find you.

01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:00.664
- You'll be okay?
- Yeah, I love you.

01:24:00.721 --> 01:24:02.021
I love you.

01:24:49.777 --> 01:24:50.878
Cola!

01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:54.701
And cherry.

01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:57.830
Makes cherry coke!

01:24:59.463 --> 01:25:01.119
My daughter taught me that.

01:25:10.807 --> 01:25:12.107
Take this.

01:25:12.514 --> 01:25:15.923
In prison, candy is like gold dust.

01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:20.357
I want to make a deal.

01:25:20.494 --> 01:25:23.762
With this...
how do you Americans call it...?

01:25:23.912 --> 01:25:26.821
Rap sheet, you need a miracle.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.593
Hagen Kahl, ever heard of him?

01:25:32.124 --> 01:25:34.490
He is an outstanding
member of this community.

01:25:34.776 --> 01:25:37.577
And the biggest drug lord in Germany.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.063
With powerful allies that
would bury such allegations.

01:25:44.407 --> 01:25:46.207
I have hard evidence.

01:25:46.269 --> 01:25:48.204
Even then he could still walk.

01:25:48.305 --> 01:25:52.078
Well, this will get you through the door,
then the rest, that's up to you.

01:25:52.162 --> 01:25:53.595
I'm listening.

01:25:56.942 --> 01:26:00.409
The truck travels from the docks
in Rotterdam to Cologna,

01:26:01.483 --> 01:26:04.217
full of golf balls packed
with cocaine from Chile.

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:09.624
It's unloaded in Hagen's depot and
then distributed across Germany.

01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:12.144
It happens once every six months.

01:26:13.549 --> 01:26:17.817
Except, last night the
shipment was stolen.

01:26:18.517 --> 01:26:19.918
By whom?

01:26:19.922 --> 01:26:22.089
You think I'm a amateur?

01:26:24.344 --> 01:26:25.644
It doesn’t matter.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.783
What matters is...

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.562
Decoy truck.

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:35.648
It's like you said, you have to be
one step ahead, have a counter attack.

01:26:36.861 --> 01:26:38.813
Why the hell do we need a decoy truck?

01:26:38.848 --> 01:26:43.037
It's insurance. In case Geran tries to
kill us instead of giving us the money.

01:26:43.084 --> 01:26:44.585
Don't you forget that.

01:26:45.563 --> 01:26:47.573
Where are we going to
get a decoy truck?

01:26:48.468 --> 01:26:49.568
We'll steal it.

01:26:49.992 --> 01:26:53.326
A couple of days before, you and me,
empty truck, minimum security.

01:27:05.001 --> 01:27:08.807
And we put the decoy truck here
off the hit point.

01:27:32.757 --> 01:27:34.886
And when we finish with the stop...

01:27:34.947 --> 01:27:36.415
swap the trailers.

01:27:58.763 --> 01:28:00.364
Simple.
Boom.

01:28:03.665 --> 01:28:07.417
I can give you that truck...
full of cocaine,

01:28:08.175 --> 01:28:09.842
with Hagen Kahl's name
on the side of it!

01:28:11.484 --> 01:28:13.785
What makes you think I'll make a deal?

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:17.392
It would be the biggest drug
bust Cologna has ever seen.

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.700
The press would love it and...

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:24.970
...your daughter would have
a hero for a father.

01:28:47.437 --> 01:28:49.438
"HAGEN KHAL, The King of Drugs"

01:28:49.606 --> 01:28:52.974
Here, this came for you this morning.

01:29:12.665 --> 01:29:14.065
Casey!!

01:29:19.683 --> 01:29:21.313
So, as I said...

01:29:22.102 --> 01:29:25.869
we all got our reasons to do
crazy things in life,

01:29:26.273 --> 01:29:29.174
but Juliette is getting the
operation she needed.

01:29:29.386 --> 01:29:32.948
We're starting a new life together.

01:29:42.445 --> 01:29:43.745
I love you.

01:29:46.705 --> 01:29:49.540
No one has ever told me that before.

01:29:49.819 --> 01:29:52.820
Girls never told you that before?

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.201
No, nobody ever.

01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:02.310
I love you.

01:30:06.266 --> 01:30:08.066
I love you, too.

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:21.313
So if the reason is good enough.

01:30:21.491 --> 01:30:23.357
If the reason is love,

01:30:26.103 --> 01:30:30.038
then maybe it's not so crazy after all.
