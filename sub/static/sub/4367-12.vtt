You are being watched.

00:04.824 --> 00:06.673
The government
has a secret system.

00:06.675 --> 00:11.028
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.497
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.499 --> 00:15.565
but it sees everything.

00:15.567 --> 00:19.002
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people.

00:19.004 --> 00:21.788
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.790 --> 00:24.074
We don't.

00:24.076 --> 00:28.679
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.681 --> 00:30.297
You will never find us.

00:30.299 --> 00:32.716
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.718 --> 00:35.734
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

you still want to catch him?

Yes. Of course.

00:42.294 --> 00:44.678
[Loud crash]

00:44.680 --> 00:45.729
John?

00:45.731 --> 00:47.848
Not going to make it, Harold.

00:47.850 --> 00:49.266
Sir, we have a problem.

00:49.268 --> 00:51.936
Your man in the suit,
we got four of them.

00:51.938 --> 00:53.470
Cuff them all.

00:53.472 --> 00:54.772
We've got the DNA evidence
from New Rochelle,

00:54.774 --> 00:56.073
got the blood
from the burned car,

00:56.075 --> 00:58.225
and thanks to you,
fingerprints.

00:58.227 --> 00:59.977
He's ours.

00:59.979 --> 01:02.329
I don't want you crossing
some kind of line to do--

01:02.331 --> 01:03.797
This?

01:03.799 --> 01:06.083
Already deleted them
from the network too.

01:06.085 --> 01:08.419
Now we have to deal
with the DNA sample.

01:08.421 --> 01:09.787
What's going on?

01:09.789 --> 01:11.255
I thought the evidence
cleared these guys.

01:11.257 --> 01:13.007
It's all too neat.

01:13.009 --> 01:14.758
There's only one person that
I know I can trust anymore.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.176
You.

01:16.178 --> 01:18.495
I know you were
a senior interrogator in Iraq.

01:18.497 --> 01:21.632
I want you to put those
military skills to use.

01:21.634 --> 01:23.431

that you are not a threat

01:43.289 --> 01:45.856
to national security.

01:45.858 --> 01:48.042
So if you ever want
to get out of here,

01:48.044 --> 01:50.628
you need to start
answering questions.

02:19.942 --> 02:21.575
I mean, come on,
you gotta need something.

02:21.577 --> 02:23.327
Are we gonna bust John
out of there or what?

02:23.329 --> 02:26.163
Oh, it sounds like such
a bad idea when you say it.

02:26.165 --> 02:29.066
But right now I need your help
in another matter.

02:29.068 --> 02:31.785
I'm sending you the name
and address of a young lady

02:31.787 --> 02:33.403
in Brooklyn.

02:33.405 --> 02:36.540
She's about to be involved
in a very bad situation.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.625
Let me get this straight.
John's ass is on the line

02:38.627 --> 02:42.096
and I'm stuck
dealing with some dumb--

02:45.016 --> 02:47.184
Yeah, I got this.

02:47.186 --> 02:50.854
My name is Devin Clark.
I own a pest control company.

02:50.856 --> 02:53.724
I just went in there
to apply for a business loan.

02:53.726 --> 02:57.094
And then I hear this loud boom
and what sounded like gunshots.

02:57.096 --> 02:58.946
So I thought the bank
was being robbed.

02:58.948 --> 03:00.481
I ran for the exit
and the next thing I know,

03:00.483 --> 03:02.366
I'm being arrested.

03:02.368 --> 03:04.735
That still doesn't explain
why you were in that basement.

03:04.737 --> 03:07.388
I was down there
inspecting the property.

03:07.390 --> 03:09.089
I'm part of a
venture capital group,

03:09.091 --> 03:12.826
we're considering an investment
in the building.

03:12.828 --> 03:15.112
Okay, mister...

03:15.114 --> 03:16.780
What did you say
your name was again?

03:16.782 --> 03:19.583
Holt. Vincent Holt.
I'm an attorney.

03:19.585 --> 03:22.452

constitutional gymnastics

03:22.454 --> 03:26.140
you people think you can pull,
when we're done here,

03:26.142 --> 03:28.559
my attorneys are gonna
shove this whole thing

03:28.561 --> 03:31.545

You're being watched, you know.

03:39.939 --> 03:43.240
The longer you wait to talk,
the more guilty you look.

03:46.694 --> 03:50.497
So...

03:50.499 --> 03:54.001
let's start with your name.

03:56.838 --> 04:00.424
John Warren.
Just like it says on my license.

04:02.544 --> 04:06.630
Okay, Mr. Warren.

04:06.632 --> 04:08.348
Mind telling me
what you were doing

04:08.350 --> 04:10.050
in the bank Monday morning?

04:10.052 --> 04:14.304
I was meeting clients.
I'm an investment banker.

04:14.306 --> 04:16.390
When I heard the explosion,
I saw smoke coming

04:16.392 --> 04:18.442
from a stairwell.

04:18.444 --> 04:20.726
I used to be in the military,
so I went down to see

04:20.728 --> 04:22.646
if I could help.

04:22.648 --> 04:25.816
I could hear shots fired,
then your SWAT team

04:25.818 --> 04:27.317
knocked me to the ground,

04:27.319 --> 04:30.654
cuffed me before
I could even explain.

04:30.656 --> 04:32.689
Basically from that moment on,
treated me like

04:32.691 --> 04:34.825
I'm some kind of terrorist.

04:34.827 --> 04:38.629
Look, I don't know why I'm here,
or who you think I am,

04:38.631 --> 04:41.131
but I have a life
I really need to get back to.

04:41.133 --> 04:43.033
And if they won't
let me see a lawyer,

04:43.035 --> 04:45.519

at work here.

05:25.744 --> 05:28.212
I want them shut down.

Find that operative
and make him disappear.

He's a hard man to locate.

05:34.753 --> 05:37.387
Not according to the FBI.

05:37.389 --> 05:39.940
They think he's one
of four suspects

05:39.942 --> 05:43.110
being held at Rikers.

I'm not "bending" anything,
warden, but in my time here

I've noticed no less than 15
serious infractions

06:14.260 --> 06:16.126
of New York regulations
governing the care

06:16.128 --> 06:17.844
and treatment of prisoners,

06:17.846 --> 06:21.648
so perhaps you should tend
to those before threatening me.

06:21.650 --> 06:23.850
[Door opens]

06:27.972 --> 06:30.991
Look, I want
to un-cuff these guys.

06:30.993 --> 06:32.309
Carter, one of these men

06:32.311 --> 06:33.694
is a highly trained
covert assassin.

06:33.696 --> 06:37.998
I need him to trust me.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.335
So we got four stories
and four IDs

06:41.337 --> 06:43.653
that pass background checks.

06:43.655 --> 06:45.455
So either someone's lying

06:45.457 --> 06:47.291
or we got the wrong four guys.

06:47.293 --> 06:48.792
If I'm right, the man
we're looking for is backed

06:48.794 --> 06:50.844
by a powerful private
intelligence network

06:50.846 --> 06:53.230
with resources comparable
to any government,

06:53.232 --> 06:55.098
and they could certainly
create an airtight cover

06:55.100 --> 06:57.517
for one of their operatives.

06:57.519 --> 06:59.136
I'm not gonna let the man
in the suit slip away

checks out.

We never use it for work.

08:30.612 --> 08:33.447
It's the most complete
identity that John has,

08:33.448 --> 08:37.451
and it most closely matches
the details of his true past.

08:37.453 --> 08:40.236

is still an illusion,

of a man who doesn't exist.

spots a single flaw,

still think they're being held

09:01.510 --> 09:04.061

they were going to commit,

09:04.063 --> 09:05.846

figure out Donnelly's

09:05.848 --> 09:07.264
actually looking for John,

09:07.266 --> 09:09.816
they'll give him up
in a heartbeat.

on one of them.

If we can hand Donnelly a name
and a military background

it might get John released.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.733
Can we just do this and go?

11:16.735 --> 11:19.286
Okay, John.

11:19.288 --> 11:23.173
If we're gonna be partners,
you're gonna have to lighten up.

11:23.175 --> 11:26.043
It's my first triple homicide.

11:26.045 --> 11:29.012
Didn't know I was
supposed to prepare jokes.

11:29.014 --> 11:32.132
These aren't murder victims.
These are enemy combatants.

11:32.134 --> 11:35.185
But yes, we are killers, John.
That is our job.

11:35.187 --> 11:37.521
And if you want to be good
at your job,

11:37.523 --> 11:41.558
you're gonna have to learn
to love your work.

11:44.595 --> 11:48.131
Have you ever killed anyone?

11:48.133 --> 11:50.117
Have you?

11:50.119 --> 11:53.420
Playing games doesn't
help your cause, Mr. Warren.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.490
- Answering questions does.
- That's right, Carter.

11:56.492 --> 11:58.291
Keep him on the defensive.

11:58.293 --> 12:02.629
Now, have you...

12:02.631 --> 12:06.500
ever killed anyone?

12:06.502 --> 12:10.286
Yes.

12:10.288 --> 12:13.907
In the army in '95.

12:13.909 --> 12:17.594
I was in Bosnia for
the IFOR peacekeeping mission.

12:17.596 --> 12:20.714
We were on patrol near Kladanj.

12:20.716 --> 12:22.215
Middle of the night,
I sneak off the road

12:22.217 --> 12:25.452
to take a whiz in the woods.

12:25.454 --> 12:29.523
And there's this Serb militant
with a bag of land mines,

12:29.525 --> 12:32.526
AK pointed right at me.

12:32.528 --> 12:35.745
It misfired.

12:35.747 --> 12:39.666
That's the only reason
why I'm still here.

12:39.668 --> 12:42.886
I jumped him
before he could pull again.

12:45.339 --> 12:49.876
We thrashed around in the dirt.

12:49.878 --> 12:52.596
And I broke his neck.

12:52.598 --> 12:56.082
Really don't like
talking about this.

12:56.084 --> 13:00.387
Keep pushing.
You hit a nerve.

13:00.389 --> 13:02.806
How long did you serve
in the military?

13:02.808 --> 13:04.507
'95 to '01.

13:04.509 --> 13:09.196
I was a sergeant
in Old Ironsides.

13:09.198 --> 13:11.398
Got out just before 9/11.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.366
Seven years. Long time.

13:13.368 --> 13:15.285
Yeah, my dad was career army.

13:15.287 --> 13:17.237
- What's your dad's name?
- Conrad.

13:17.239 --> 13:18.989
[Sighs]
That's enough about dad.

13:18.991 --> 13:21.007
Get back to the dead Serb.
He's vulnerable there.

13:21.009 --> 13:26.129
- So you were a military brat?
- Ah, kind of.

13:26.131 --> 13:27.363
My mom's family owned a farm

13:27.365 --> 13:29.382
just outside of
Sumner, Washington.

13:29.384 --> 13:32.068
I stayed home with her
when my dad was overseas.

13:32.070 --> 13:37.174
He got out when I was 11,
came home to run the farm.

13:38.059 --> 13:41.211
So where did you serve?

13:41.213 --> 13:45.882
You didn't ask
what Old Ironsides was.

13:45.884 --> 13:48.602
[Chuckles]

13:48.604 --> 13:51.888
Warrant Officer.
Ivy Division.

13:51.890 --> 13:56.426
Deployments in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

13:56.428 --> 14:00.981
Let me guess.
97 Echo.

14:00.983 --> 14:02.749
You were an interrogator.

14:02.751 --> 14:06.703
[Chuckles] Guilty as charged.

14:06.705 --> 14:08.622
[Knock on door]

14:08.624 --> 14:13.593
Excuse me.

14:13.595 --> 14:16.213
- Is the earpiece not working?
- I'm building rapport.

14:16.215 --> 14:18.632
That's how you get good intel.

14:18.634 --> 14:20.800
Would you rather
I waterboarded him?

14:20.802 --> 14:23.103
Of course not, and honestly,

14:23.105 --> 14:25.605
everything he's said
checks out.

14:25.607 --> 14:28.892
So you think we might
be digging in the wrong spot?

14:28.894 --> 14:30.227
No.
To catch this man, Carter,

14:30.229 --> 14:31.728
I'd dig all the way to China.

14:31.730 --> 14:33.596
We need to hit the other three
just as hard.

14:33.598 --> 14:35.365
But we need to work fast.

14:35.367 --> 14:37.400
Powerful forces have already
sabotaged this investigation.

14:37.402 --> 14:40.987
We need to know who's who
before someone strikes again.

14:40.989 --> 14:44.157
Turn around, please.

14:46.610 --> 14:47.877
Spread your arms,
open your mouth,

14:47.879 --> 14:49.212
stick out your tongue.

14:49.214 --> 14:51.915
- Ever serve in the military?
- No.

14:51.917 --> 14:53.466
Ask where he went
to middle school.

14:53.468 --> 14:54.918
Where did you go
to middle school?

14:54.920 --> 14:57.470
Pullman, Illinois.
Robert Goddard.

14:57.472 --> 14:59.422
- What was your name again?
- Devin Clark.

14:59.424 --> 15:01.291
- And where were you born?
- Akron.

15:01.293 --> 15:02.809
Who are you working for?

15:02.811 --> 15:06.012
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:06.014 --> 15:08.131
[Inmates shouting]

15:08.133 --> 15:11.484
- What's your address?
- 713 East 66th, apartment 5B.

15:11.486 --> 15:13.169
- Middle name.
- Benjamin.

15:13.171 --> 15:15.355
What's his birth date?
Hometown?

15:15.357 --> 15:16.406
Social Security number?

15:16.408 --> 15:18.408
11-27-74.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.475
Sarasota, Florida.

15:19.477 --> 15:20.643
4-9-8-0-0.

15:20.645 --> 15:21.745
3-1-4-5.

15:21.747 --> 15:23.113
What was your MOS?

15:23.115 --> 15:24.698
I told you
I wasn't in the military.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.866
Then how the hell did you
know what an MOS was?

15:26.868 --> 15:30.870
Now what's your damn name?

15:30.872 --> 15:34.674
Brian Kelly, ex-Navy SEAL.
You can read him his rights now.

15:34.676 --> 15:36.993
Let's go.

15:36.995 --> 15:38.712
You have the right
to remain silent.

15:38.714 --> 15:41.047
Anything you say can--

15:41.049 --> 15:42.832
So that's it.
He's our guy.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.267
Unfortunately not.

15:44.269 --> 15:45.552
While our man in the suit

15:45.554 --> 15:46.770
was committing homicide
in New Rochelle,

15:46.772 --> 15:48.972
Mr. Kelly was in Iraq.

15:48.974 --> 15:51.007
Now that he's been identified,
the public safety exception

15:51.009 --> 15:52.609
no longer applies.

15:52.611 --> 15:57.981
So one down, three to go.

15:57.983 --> 16:00.367
1:00 PM,
food and exercise.

16:02.903 --> 16:09.109
[Indistinct chatter]

16:19.720 --> 16:21.871
Well, well, well.

16:21.873 --> 16:24.674
Look what the cat dragged in.

16:24.676 --> 16:27.177
You know, this is the bastard
that stole my dog.

16:27.179 --> 16:30.397
Let's be honest.
He wanted to leave.

16:30.399 --> 16:32.098
[Chuckles]

16:32.100 --> 16:35.402
Yeah, you're also the reason
I'm stuck in this dump.

16:37.154 --> 16:39.489
Is there a problem here?

16:39.491 --> 16:42.942
No. Nothing that can't
be fixed later.

16:47.581 --> 16:50.450
Someone wants to see you.

17:02.930 --> 17:05.131
Hello, John.

17:21.682 --> 17:22.598
_

17:25.300 --> 17:27.501
<i>Deux Kirs Royaux,</i>
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

17:27.502 --> 17:29.754
<i>Tres bien.</i>

17:32.290 --> 17:34.809
- What did they do?
- Who cares?

17:34.811 --> 17:37.127
Orders are orders.

17:37.129 --> 17:39.146
Just making sure
we have the right target.

17:39.148 --> 17:41.515
They just look like
two people in love.

17:41.517 --> 17:43.484
Maybe they are.

17:43.486 --> 17:47.772
Or maybe they're just better
at playing their cover than you.

17:47.774 --> 17:52.293
Would it kill you to kiss a girl
every once in a while?

17:52.295 --> 17:56.080
Alone at last.
Time to get to work.

18:00.085 --> 18:02.670
[Gunshots]

18:04.923 --> 18:07.842
So, John, your past
finally caught up with you.

18:07.844 --> 18:10.261
Whatever the circumstances,
it's lovely to see you again.

18:10.263 --> 18:14.381
Relax. Right here.
It's a dead zone.

18:14.383 --> 18:16.667
No cameras can see us.

18:16.669 --> 18:20.671
Can't have Agent Donnelly
spying on our reunion, can we?

18:20.673 --> 18:23.474
I know all about his hunt
for the "man in a suit."

18:23.476 --> 18:25.025
Personally,
I think they could've

18:25.027 --> 18:28.679
come up with a better name.

18:28.681 --> 18:31.482
Are you going
to turn me in, Elias?

18:31.484 --> 18:34.702
And lose Harold
as a chess partner?

18:34.704 --> 18:38.456
I was pissed for a while,
but the truth is, John,

18:38.458 --> 18:40.023
you'll always be the man
who came out of nowhere

18:40.025 --> 18:41.959
and saved my life.

18:41.961 --> 18:43.994
I want you to think of me
as a friend,

18:43.996 --> 18:46.864
and when I see my friends
in trouble I want to help, so...

18:46.866 --> 18:50.718
Well for starters,
don't protect me.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.970
Donnelly used to think
I was working for you.

18:52.972 --> 18:56.140
Hey, well, it's not for lack
of asking on my part.

18:56.142 --> 18:59.477
See that guy over there?

18:59.479 --> 19:01.962
Yeah.
You want us to kill him?

19:01.964 --> 19:04.231
I'm not so sure you could.

19:04.233 --> 19:06.684
I've got a hunch
he's a lot like me.

19:06.686 --> 19:11.522
You want to help?
Get a picture of him to Harold.

19:11.524 --> 19:13.941
If there's another player
at the table,

19:13.943 --> 19:16.076
I'd like to know
who we're dealing with.

19:16.078 --> 19:18.913
You and me working together.

19:18.915 --> 19:21.165
Very exciting, John.
[Sighs]

19:27.756 --> 19:30.207
Come on, there's a precinct
two blocks away.

19:30.209 --> 19:32.660
- No! No police!
- Okay, what's this about?

19:32.662 --> 19:35.713
Why do they
want you dead anyway?

19:35.715 --> 19:37.080
Here. Here. Here.
Right here. Right here.

19:37.082 --> 19:41.051
[Phone rings]

19:41.053 --> 19:43.354
Thank God. I could use
a hand right about now.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.606
Actually, I was hoping
for your assistance, Detective.

19:45.608 --> 19:47.608
I'm sending you
a picture of the man

19:47.610 --> 19:49.860
who is incarcerated
with our friend.

19:49.862 --> 19:51.595
Fusco, the Armenians.

19:51.597 --> 19:54.231
I was wondering if you
could use NYPD's resources

19:54.233 --> 19:55.816
to identify him.

19:55.818 --> 19:58.035
[Phone chimes]

19:59.037 --> 20:00.654
Him? That's easy.

20:00.656 --> 20:02.122
That's the government spook
who was sniffing around

20:02.124 --> 20:04.658
when Corwin got shot.

20:04.660 --> 20:05.910
Okay.
Thank you, Detective.

20:05.912 --> 20:07.277
Any chance you
can give us a hand

20:07.279 --> 20:08.329
with these Armenians
that want to kill--

20:08.331 --> 20:09.380
[Clicks off]

20:09.382 --> 20:11.966
Do you have any enemies?

20:11.968 --> 20:13.300
Well, I'm pretty sure

20:13.302 --> 20:15.553
the guy behind that mirror
isn't a fan.

20:15.555 --> 20:17.638
[Chuckles] Push for details.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.390
Find the questions
he doesn't want you to ask.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.042
Why did you leave the military?

20:22.044 --> 20:23.761
It was time.

20:23.763 --> 20:26.597
Yeah, but a lot of people
who felt that way

20:26.599 --> 20:31.435
wound up re-enlisting
right after 9/11, but not you.

20:31.437 --> 20:35.406
There's a point where if you
stay a soldier any longer,

20:35.408 --> 20:39.109
you won't know how
to be anything else.

20:39.111 --> 20:42.980
So I got out, went back
to U-DUB for my MBA.

20:42.982 --> 20:46.250
And after college,
where did you work?

20:46.252 --> 20:51.038
Let's see,
there was Pacific Capital,

20:51.040 --> 20:54.458
Cambridge Securities, BPC.

20:54.460 --> 20:58.345
- You moved around a lot.
- I guess I was drifting a bit.

20:58.347 --> 21:02.516
Job to job, place to place.
Damn near broke for a while.

21:02.518 --> 21:06.353
But then, a good man
found me and gave me a...

21:06.355 --> 21:08.105
purpose.

21:08.107 --> 21:10.274
Who was that?

21:10.276 --> 21:13.994
My current employer,
Howard French.

21:13.996 --> 21:15.613
Keep him talking.

21:15.615 --> 21:17.448
I'm running a background check
on Howard French.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.782
Don't worry, Detective.

21:18.784 --> 21:20.684
Howard French will
check out just fine.

21:20.686 --> 21:22.286
Oh, and I've hacked the link

21:22.288 --> 21:24.204
between Donnelly's computer
and your earpiece.

21:24.206 --> 21:25.623
But rest assured,

21:25.625 --> 21:27.324
you're the only one
that can hear me.

21:27.326 --> 21:30.861
How did you
and Mr. French meet?

21:30.863 --> 21:34.381
He found my resume online.
Called me in for a meeting.

21:34.383 --> 21:37.251
And then he told me
who he was, what he did.

21:37.253 --> 21:39.136
Asked if I wanted to help.

21:39.138 --> 21:41.989
You can call Howard
and ask him about me.

21:41.991 --> 21:44.892
I'm sure he's wondering
where I am.

21:44.894 --> 21:46.343
Come on out, Carter.

21:46.345 --> 21:48.762
One of the other suspects
is ready to talk.

21:48.764 --> 21:52.399
Excuse me.

21:55.737 --> 21:58.055
All right.
I know what's going on here.

21:58.057 --> 22:00.407
I've been waiting
two damn hours.

22:00.409 --> 22:01.859
And if you're
not talking to me,

22:01.861 --> 22:05.079
someone else
must be talking to you.

22:05.081 --> 22:09.583
Screw that.
Nobody rats me out.

22:09.585 --> 22:13.504
My name isn't Devin Clark.
It's Charles MacAvoy.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.039
And you give me immunity,

22:15.041 --> 22:17.925
I tell you anything
you want to know.

22:17.927 --> 22:19.209
Can't give you immunity

22:19.211 --> 22:21.712
until I know
what you did, Chuck.

22:21.714 --> 22:25.415
So let's start with what
you were doing in that bank.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.633
[Door opens]

22:26.635 --> 22:27.968
Donnelly.

22:27.970 --> 22:31.355
You ever been
to New Rochelle, MacAvoy?

22:31.357 --> 22:32.923
No.

22:32.925 --> 22:34.391
Are you now
or have you ever been

22:34.393 --> 22:36.026
an employee of Ansible,
Worldstrat,

22:36.028 --> 22:37.695
or any other
private intelligence firm?

22:37.697 --> 22:40.698
Donnelly, look,
you're showing all our cards.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.566

Put them on your friend here.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.629
See?
[Handcuffs clicking]

37:27.631 --> 37:29.714
I told you we'd catch him.

37:29.716 --> 37:31.633
But I'm afraid
that's the last collar

37:31.635 --> 37:34.252
you'll ever make.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.722
[Handcuffs clicking]

37:37.724 --> 37:42.144
I trusted you, Carter,
and you threw it away

37:42.146 --> 37:45.263
along with a very
promising career.

37:47.150 --> 37:49.518
I'm sorry.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.103
It was my fault.

37:51.105 --> 37:54.472
Actually, John, it's not.

37:54.474 --> 37:55.740
This little game
you two have been playing,

37:55.742 --> 37:58.193
you didn't give it away.
She did.

37:58.195 --> 38:02.998
And now I'm going to find out
exactly who you are.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.489
We believe someone
inside the Pentagon

38:11.491 --> 38:14.826
sold a secure laptop containing
some of the source code

38:14.828 --> 38:16.494
to a Chinese firm.

38:16.496 --> 38:18.496
We need the laptop returned.

38:18.498 --> 38:20.432
- Where are we going?
- Ordos.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.968
It's a company town
in the middle of China.

38:27.773 --> 38:32.777
Reese,
after you secure the package,

38:32.779 --> 38:36.565
you're to retire Agent Stanton.

38:41.353 --> 38:44.239
I haven't seen
that look in a while.

38:44.241 --> 38:49.578
- Everything okay?
- Absolutely.

38:49.580 --> 38:52.297
Whatever it is, lock it down.

38:52.299 --> 38:55.884
I don't need this guy.
I need the killer.

39:14.737 --> 39:17.072
Listen, Kara,
there's something you need to--

39:17.074 --> 39:18.740
[Gunshot]

39:18.742 --> 39:21.993
Sorry, John.
Nothing personal.

39:21.995 --> 39:23.995
[Laughs] Something funny?

39:23.997 --> 39:26.831
I got the same orders as you.

39:26.833 --> 39:29.000
[Jets whooshing overhead]

39:29.002 --> 39:31.453
[Rocket fires]

39:48.420 --> 39:50.472
Thank you, Lionel,

39:50.474 --> 39:53.642
for everything.

39:57.096 --> 39:59.197
Call me.

39:59.199 --> 40:02.767
[Phone rings]

40:02.769 --> 40:07.239
[Ringing continues]

40:07.241 --> 40:09.624
- What?
- We have an emergency.

40:09.626 --> 40:11.626
I'm sending you Carter's
last known coordinates.

40:11.628 --> 40:14.879
I'll meet you there.

40:14.881 --> 40:19.251
[Pay phone rings]

40:22.171 --> 40:24.923
[Second pay phone rings]

40:24.925 --> 40:29.144
[Several pay phones ringing]

40:31.047 --> 40:35.650
[Ringing continues]

40:35.652 --> 40:39.470
[Automated voices]
Apocryphal. Charlie. Tango.

40:39.472 --> 40:42.857
Toward. Mark. Whiskey.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.416
Where are you taking us?

40:51.418 --> 40:53.034
To a safe house,

40:53.036 --> 40:54.703
where I'll contact
a friend at Justice,

40:54.705 --> 40:58.990
figure out how to proceed
with your prosecution.

41:03.879 --> 41:07.799
No backup?
You're going it alone, huh?

41:07.801 --> 41:11.502
Well, Carter, I don't know
who to trust anymore.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.393
When the man in a suit--
when John here

41:18.395 --> 41:20.695
slipped away the first time,
I knew he had a mole,

41:20.697 --> 41:22.781
somebody on the inside.

41:22.783 --> 41:24.149
And then when
his fingerprints went missing

41:24.151 --> 41:25.367
and his DNA got switched,

41:25.369 --> 41:27.352
I was forced to consider
it might be you.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.954
And I'll admit,
you played a pretty good game

41:29.956 --> 41:32.040
until I put him
in the yard alone.

41:32.042 --> 41:36.244
And that's when I saw it...
in your eyes.

41:36.246 --> 41:41.549
Genuine concern.

41:41.551 --> 41:43.635
How did he turn you, Carter?

41:43.637 --> 41:46.371
What was your price?

41:51.010 --> 41:54.879
No price.
Just helping a friend.

41:54.881 --> 41:57.599
[Scoffs] Then you've
been played for a fool.

41:57.601 --> 41:59.717
Recruited as an asset
by a private intelligence--

41:59.719 --> 42:01.653
You don't understand,
Donnelly, he's a good man.

42:01.655 --> 42:03.154
We're helping people.

42:03.156 --> 42:05.073
[Laughs] Oh, God.
Is that what he told you?

42:05.075 --> 42:06.491
Wake up, Carter.

42:06.493 --> 42:08.576
Your friend
is nothing more or less

42:08.578 --> 42:10.862
than a highly trained murderer.

42:10.864 --> 42:13.865
You don't wind up
with that job by accident.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.450
He chose that life.

42:15.452 --> 42:18.703
He chose to become
the monster he is.

42:18.705 --> 42:21.172
And now you've
made your choice too.

42:21.174 --> 42:25.243
[Scoffs]

42:34.186 --> 42:36.121
Oh, no.

42:36.123 --> 42:38.289
[Phone rings]

42:38.291 --> 42:40.191
- Agent Donnelly, stop your car!
- Who is this?

42:40.193 --> 42:42.026
I'm the partner of the man
in your backseat.

42:42.028 --> 42:43.778
I have a source that tells me
you're in grave danger.

42:43.780 --> 42:46.097
And trust me,
my source is never--

42:46.099 --> 42:48.400
Aah!

43:16.128 --> 43:18.263
[Donnelly grunts]

43:29.608 --> 43:32.944
Hey, lover.

43:32.946 --> 43:35.447
Miss me?
