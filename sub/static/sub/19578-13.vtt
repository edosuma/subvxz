The word "desert"
didn't always mean

01:10.704 --> 01:13.205
"a sea of sand
with camels and mirages".

01:13.207 --> 01:15.474
Its Latin root means
"an abandoned place,"

more abandoned

of mining camps that flourished

nitrate mining boom.

were terrible

bordering on slavery.

Many workers, including
young children,

01:35.162 --> 01:36.862
suffered horrible deaths.

nearby city of iquique

rise from their graves at night

get across the lake.

There's a freshwater eel
called the long-finned
eel in New Zealand,

41:04.463 --> 41:06.763
and they get to be
over 6 feet long.

41:06.765 --> 41:10.333
So, I can really see
how somebody would look
at that and maybe say,

41:10.335 --> 41:14.304
"wow, that's something different
than just a normal animal."

41:14.306 --> 41:16.573
GATES:
The large-finned eel
found only in New Zealand,

41:16.575 --> 41:20.109
may well be a prime suspect
for <i> taniwha</i> misidentification.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.344
It is, after all,

41:21.346 --> 41:23.279
among the larger species of eel
in the world.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.181
The bony rays
on its pectoral fins

41:25.183 --> 41:27.183
give the eel
unique characteristics

41:27.185 --> 41:29.419
that align closely
to eyewitness testimony.

41:29.421 --> 41:31.754
The <i> taniwha</i> has been
immortalized in maori myth

41:31.756 --> 41:34.824
to such a degree that his
origins are ultimately unknown.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.626
We do know that
the earliest polynesians

41:36.628 --> 41:38.895
blended the natural
and spiritual world

41:38.897 --> 41:41.531
into a complex tapestry
of sacred creatures

41:41.533 --> 41:44.167
in an effort to understand
this wild paradise.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.535
It is this
communion with nature

41:45.537 --> 41:47.804
that defines the maori people
of today.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.240
And though the <i> taniwha</i>
is likely a large eel,

41:50.242 --> 41:52.742
it is also a potent symbol
designed to remind us

41:52.744 --> 41:55.011
of the power
of the natural world.
Forward!
Forward!

41:55.013 --> 41:56.346
Hold on!
