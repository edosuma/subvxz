00:02.252 --> 00:04.709
Ooh, here comes Aunt Hilda
and Mr. Kraft.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.297
- Ten bucks says he kisses her.
- Twenty bucks says she throws up.

00:08.467 --> 00:13.592
And that is why I packed up everything
I owned into my '72 Dodge Dart.

00:13.763 --> 00:17.263
And I just left Muncie
and headed for Westbridge.

00:17.433 --> 00:19.593
- Uh-huh. Good night.
- You know,

00:19.769 --> 00:22.723
I had a wonderful time tonight, Hilda.

00:22.896 --> 00:24.640
<i>A heavy heart, Beloved,
Have I borne</i>

00:24.814 --> 00:27.353
<i>From year to year
Until I saw thy face</i>

00:27.526 --> 00:30.148
Oh, would you look at the time?
I really, really--

00:32.238 --> 00:34.315
Isn't that your car
rolling down the hill?

00:34.490 --> 00:36.033
Oh, good Lord.

00:38.619 --> 00:40.447
Quick. She's coming.

00:44.958 --> 00:47.710
Hey. What are you guys doing?

00:47.877 --> 00:49.420
<i>A heavy heart, Beloved,
I have borne</i>

00:49.587 --> 00:51.829
<i>- From year to year</i>
- Hold me, Willard.

00:53.465 --> 00:56.467
A cat is doing an imitation of me
kissing my niece's vice principal.

00:57.177 --> 00:59.337
So this is my lowest moment.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.742 --> 01:26.780
- So where did Mr. Kraft take you?
- The cattle auction.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.623
There's a man
who likes his beef fresh.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.831
No, he just likes to know
the price of cattle.

01:32.001 --> 01:33.543
We skipped dinner. He's on a diet.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.668
Whenever he's hungry,
he drinks iced tea.

01:35.837 --> 01:38.506
He hasn't lost any weight,
but at least he's jittery.

01:38.673 --> 01:41.342
I don't know what to say.
Is that a fun date for people your age?

01:41.509 --> 01:43.217
No. Willard's one of those people

01:43.385 --> 01:46.221
who hit middle age
and just forgot how to have fun.

01:46.430 --> 01:49.764
Hildegard Antoinette Spellman.

01:49.933 --> 01:52.093
You used my labtop again
without asking.

01:52.269 --> 01:55.519
And then there are some people
who are middle-aged their whole lives.

01:55.688 --> 01:57.100
The purpose of the labtop

01:57.273 --> 02:00.275
is to help discover cures
for the problems of the world.

02:00.443 --> 02:02.401
Not to make fudge.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.850
I'm sorry, Zelda.

02:04.029 --> 02:06.984
Boy, this has not been
a good night for me.

02:07.157 --> 02:09.234
You don't have to go out
with Mr. Kraft anymore.

02:09.408 --> 02:11.450
- I'm seeing him again this weekend.
- What?

02:11.620 --> 02:13.329
- What?
- Well, he may be a bad date,

02:13.496 --> 02:16.830
but when you live as long as we do,
you have a lot of Friday nights to fill.

02:20.961 --> 02:22.373
Well, I feel refreshed.

02:22.546 --> 02:24.669
Oh, here. Maybe I can help.

02:26.049 --> 02:28.042
Have you ever tried anger therapy?

02:28.218 --> 02:30.010
Now try it.

02:30.803 --> 02:32.085
Oh! Oh...

02:32.305 --> 02:35.674
It usually works on the one
in the faculty lounge.

02:38.185 --> 02:42.397
Sabrina, look. The PTA is sponsoring
a ski trip to Vermont this weekend.

02:42.564 --> 02:43.597
Let's sign up.

02:43.774 --> 02:46.312
I can't believe the PTA came up
with something fun to do.

02:46.484 --> 02:47.979
Let's see how they ruin this.

02:48.152 --> 02:50.360
I'm so glad they picked you
to chaperon the ski trip.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.440
Well, you know my motto:

02:52.615 --> 02:55.320
fun, with discipline.

02:56.618 --> 02:59.192
Did your hope die first or mine?

03:00.956 --> 03:02.581
Motion passed.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.501
All nut items will be eliminated
from future bake sales

03:05.668 --> 03:08.504
due to janitor Bill's allergic reaction.

03:08.671 --> 03:11.673
And I am told he is finally
breathing on his own again.

03:11.841 --> 03:12.873
Okay, next up:

03:13.050 --> 03:15.043
We need to vote on
how to spend the money

03:15.218 --> 03:17.508
that last year's seniors left.

03:17.679 --> 03:19.838
- Loser.
- Heard that.

03:20.014 --> 03:22.767
Well, I think we should spend it
sponsoring the cheerleaders

03:22.934 --> 03:25.093
to go to a unique
cheerleading workshop

03:25.270 --> 03:26.515
in France.

03:26.687 --> 03:27.850
Oh, please.

03:28.021 --> 03:30.940
So the brightest and best
of today's youth

03:31.108 --> 03:32.484
taking their American values

03:32.651 --> 03:34.894
over to the godless countries
in Europe.

03:35.987 --> 03:38.443
I think that is a nifty idea.

03:38.614 --> 03:39.944
Any other proposals?

03:40.116 --> 03:42.406
I think we should get
a drinking fountain that works.

03:42.577 --> 03:45.495
Not only would it benefit our class,
but the entire student body.

03:46.872 --> 03:50.123
Uh-huh. Okay, well, let's vote. Those
in favour of the drinking fountain,

03:50.292 --> 03:51.324
raise their hands.

03:51.501 --> 03:53.827
All those in favour of sending
our cheerleaders to camp,

03:54.004 --> 03:55.547
raise their hands.

03:57.089 --> 03:58.501
Okay. Motion passed.

03:58.674 --> 04:00.715
Congratulations, Libby. Enjoy Europe.

04:00.885 --> 04:03.756
More people raised their hands
in favour of the water fountain.

04:03.929 --> 04:06.053
And I used my veto to overrule them.

04:06.223 --> 04:08.299
But I thought a student government
was democratic.

04:08.474 --> 04:10.053
And I am certain that our forefathers

04:10.226 --> 04:12.635
would have wanted our cheerleaders
to see Paris.

04:12.812 --> 04:14.936
And Brussels on the weekend.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.980
Sabrina, have you been using
my labtop again without asking?

04:22.154 --> 04:23.946
If you're proud of my initiative,
then yes?

04:24.114 --> 04:25.444
Well, I'm not.

04:25.616 --> 04:27.240
That gonna make
dressing a problem?

04:27.408 --> 04:29.201
What did you make with my labtop?

04:29.368 --> 04:31.611
Hair mousse,
but you would really understand

04:31.787 --> 04:34.362
if you could have seen
what my hair looked like that day.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.000
I am making a new house rule:

04:36.167 --> 04:39.618
No one plays with my labtop, period,
now matter how hungry you are,

04:39.794 --> 04:41.622
- no matter how ungroomed.
- But what if--?

04:41.796 --> 04:42.960
- No.
- And how about if--?

04:43.131 --> 04:44.330
No.

04:44.508 --> 04:46.217
She's waffling.

04:47.177 --> 04:50.344
Okay, now, in order to ensure
everyone's safety on this trip,

04:50.513 --> 04:54.346
I have established
a few simple guidelines.

04:54.517 --> 04:56.344
"No snacking between meals.

04:56.519 --> 04:58.974
- Lights out at 8:00"?
- "No laughing"?

04:59.771 --> 05:02.808
And since we'll be staying at
my ex-father-in-law's condo

05:02.982 --> 05:04.976
to save a little bit of money,

05:05.151 --> 05:07.109
everyone will have to pitch in
with the chores.

05:08.987 --> 05:10.613
- Will we get paid?
- You will be paid

05:10.781 --> 05:14.115
with up to 45 minutes a day
of ski time, mister.

05:15.077 --> 05:17.236
Since it's about ten minutes
until school starts,

05:17.412 --> 05:19.489
I'm sure you've got some homework
you've forgotten

05:19.664 --> 05:21.907
or some property to destroy.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.827
Coming through.

05:24.502 --> 05:27.255
Obviously, he's never been loved.
That's sad.

05:27.421 --> 05:29.544
Perfectly understandable, but sad.

05:29.714 --> 05:32.586
The guy's completely forgotten
what it's like to be a teenager.

05:32.759 --> 05:35.216
If only there was some way
to remind him.

05:35.679 --> 05:38.171
- I'll be back before homeroom's over.
- Where you going?

05:38.348 --> 05:41.515
To zap-- A-dee doo-dah into the hall.

05:41.684 --> 05:43.144
See you.

05:44.979 --> 05:46.142
You sure about this?

05:46.313 --> 05:49.102
Zelda was pretty explicit
about not going near this thing.

05:49.274 --> 05:50.603
She said not to play with it.

05:50.775 --> 05:53.314
She also said the labtop was for
curing problems of the world.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.480
Mr. Kraft is definitely
a problem of the world.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.696
Whatever. If she knew
you were brewing a potion

05:57.866 --> 05:59.905
to make Mr. Kraft
understand teenagers,

06:00.075 --> 06:01.405
I know what she'd say.

06:01.577 --> 06:03.701
It rhymes with "whoa."

06:06.707 --> 06:08.083
Oh, it worked.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.918
- Candy?
- No. I'd probably break out.

06:13.004 --> 06:15.959
"For a teenager's outlook on life,
take three candies.

06:16.132 --> 06:20.130
Caution: May result in the ability
to eat an entire box of cereal."

06:20.302 --> 06:22.342
Perfect. I'll just slip a few
into his iced tea.

06:25.724 --> 06:27.634
The game is afoot.

06:45.533 --> 06:48.369
All right, you clowns,
get down from there.

06:48.536 --> 06:52.830
Have you nothing better to do
than climb the cafeter--?

06:53.749 --> 06:55.327
Cafeteria?

06:55.876 --> 06:57.537
Be in my office in five minutes.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.503
This is a school, not a bordello.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.937
Miss Spellman,

07:25.110 --> 07:28.029
why have you been following me
around all morning?

07:28.197 --> 07:31.069
It's your cologne, Mr. Kraft.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.243
It's so great that I wanna buy some
for my friend Harvey.

07:34.410 --> 07:40.165
Well, you can think about
my Old Spice in detention.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.535
- But what's my crime?
- Smelling the vice principal.

07:51.093 --> 07:52.422
Now, that's funny.

07:52.593 --> 07:54.421
I seem to be out of detention slips.

07:54.595 --> 07:58.048
You just wait right here
while I go to the supply closet.

08:06.648 --> 08:08.476
Now what are you doing
with my iced tea?

08:08.650 --> 08:11.059
I just thought you might be thirsty.

08:11.236 --> 08:13.478
Miss Spellman...

08:15.197 --> 08:17.487
...kissing up is a way of life,

08:17.658 --> 08:20.530
not just something you do
when it suits you.

08:28.877 --> 08:30.336
Mr. Kraft, are you all right?

08:30.545 --> 08:32.788
We need tunes.

08:35.924 --> 08:38.381
What is this? Ha. "Detention."

08:38.552 --> 08:41.424
You can feel "de" tension
in "de" room, huh?

08:44.974 --> 08:46.553
We got the ski-trip chores.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.387
I have to paint the living room.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.934
Mr. Barber. Loser.

08:51.481 --> 08:52.513
- Mr. Kraft.
- Hey.

08:52.690 --> 08:54.268
You want something?

08:55.400 --> 08:56.432
Hiyo!

08:56.610 --> 08:57.891
Let's hear it for Gordie.

08:58.069 --> 08:59.730
Nice move.

09:00.655 --> 09:02.898
So the ski trip?

09:03.074 --> 09:06.657
I am packing supplies
for water balloons.

09:06.827 --> 09:09.533
- Do we still have to clean the place?
- No, we'll just fake it.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.284
You know, spread potpourri
everywhere,

09:11.457 --> 09:13.036
make sure there's paper
in the johns.

09:14.335 --> 09:17.371
Hey, did I ever tell you guys
about the time my toenail got infected?

09:17.545 --> 09:19.124
It turned, like, completely green.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.709
- Excuse me, Mr. Kraft.
- What?

09:20.882 --> 09:23.374
Sign this so the cheerleaders
can get our trip approved.

09:23.551 --> 09:24.584
Later.

09:24.803 --> 09:25.882
- Please?
- It falls off.

09:26.053 --> 09:28.722
I took the liberty of filling in
all pesky blank parts.

09:28.889 --> 09:30.930
Give me.
Anyway, then the nail falls off.

09:31.099 --> 09:33.805
Next day, I find the thing
floating around in my sock.

09:33.977 --> 09:35.093
How gross is that?

09:35.270 --> 09:37.263
Okay. There.

09:37.438 --> 09:39.811
- Super.
- You really want this, don't you, huh?

09:40.024 --> 09:41.188
Huh? Huh? Huh?

09:41.359 --> 09:43.732
You want it? You want it?
Harvey, think fast.

09:45.613 --> 09:47.736
Harvey, I'm open. Harvey.

09:51.243 --> 09:53.367
Who was that to, Kinkle?

09:56.789 --> 09:57.953
Ew.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.500
Oh, here's the world's smallest violin

10:01.669 --> 10:05.335
playing the world's saddest song
just for you.

10:05.881 --> 10:07.921
Wow. He seems different.

10:08.925 --> 10:10.504
I know.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.053
You're kidding.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.056
He played "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
with his nose?

10:15.223 --> 10:18.224
Four verses. This spell is working
way better than expected.

10:18.392 --> 10:19.424
Unbelievable.

10:19.601 --> 10:22.058
I wonder how it's affecting
his date with Hilda.

10:23.272 --> 10:24.981
He's on a date with Aunt Hilda?

10:25.149 --> 10:28.019
Willard, I can't tell you
how much fun I had tonight.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.853
How did you ever guess
that man's weight?

10:30.069 --> 10:32.692
Oh, that was easy.
You know, he's just a big tub of goo.

10:32.905 --> 10:35.480
- Ha-ha. Well...
- Ha. Well...

10:35.658 --> 10:37.283
Jeez, I...

10:39.536 --> 10:43.072
Wow. Touchdown, Kraft.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.623
Hi, Aunt Hilda. How was your date?

10:47.793 --> 10:50.119
Great. We threw softballs at clowns.

10:50.296 --> 10:53.002
We held hands at the fun house.
We spit off the monorail.

10:53.174 --> 10:56.508
I'm crazy about Willard Kraft.

10:57.344 --> 10:59.670
Okay, so she's in love
with someone who's under a spell,

10:59.846 --> 11:01.425
but at least I'm not in trouble.

11:02.265 --> 11:03.725
Is that the bus?

11:03.892 --> 11:06.929
No, that's the same street sweeper
that went by ten minutes ago.

11:07.103 --> 11:08.266
He'd better get here.

11:08.437 --> 11:10.763
I'm starting to feel a camaraderie
with you people.

11:10.939 --> 11:12.316
Well, here comes Mr. Kraft.

11:12.483 --> 11:14.275
I'm sure there's an explanation.

11:14.443 --> 11:16.271
Mr. Kraft, why is the bus so late?

11:17.613 --> 11:19.155
Hire the bus.

11:19.322 --> 11:22.324
I told my mother to remind me.

11:22.492 --> 11:25.695
I'm sorry. Well, okay, so I goofed.

11:25.870 --> 11:27.496
It's just not the end of the world.

11:27.663 --> 11:30.415
- I'm sure we can fix this somehow.
- What can we do?

11:30.582 --> 11:32.374
I know. I'll race you to the arcade.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.038
I really think we should stay here

11:34.211 --> 11:35.872
and make sure
everyone gets a ride home.

11:36.046 --> 11:38.454
Okay, you do that. Come on.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.205
If you leave,
I'm going to have to report you.

11:41.383 --> 11:42.795
He'll be back with some help.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.840
Right. After he stops mooning us.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.310
Why are the halls such a mess?

11:52.477 --> 11:54.803
Didn't you hear?
Mr. Kraft forgot to pay the janitors,

11:54.979 --> 11:57.649
so they're on strike.
Avoid the bathrooms.

11:57.816 --> 12:00.651
You're kidding.
I didn't know he took care of that.

12:00.984 --> 12:02.017
Or that.

12:02.194 --> 12:04.520
Why has he been acting
totally weird lately?

12:04.696 --> 12:05.942
I hadn't really noticed.

12:06.115 --> 12:07.195
Listen up, butt-brains.

12:07.366 --> 12:10.118
Everyone has to write a report
on last night's <i>Team Knight Rider.</i>

12:10.284 --> 12:12.029
Faked you out. Ha-ha.

12:15.164 --> 12:18.285
Okay, maybe he has been acting
a little strange.

12:18.459 --> 12:19.491
Gotta go.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.122
- Salem, it's me.
- So, what's the haps?

12:24.297 --> 12:27.299
It's the spell. You gotta find something
in the magic book to reverse it.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.295
Mr. Kraft keeps getting younger
and younger.

12:29.469 --> 12:32.304
Freeze. N.Y.P.D.
We're going downtown.

12:34.974 --> 12:37.466
And I think he's been watching
way too much TV.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.185
What's going on?
Why isn't anyone eating?

12:40.354 --> 12:42.477
Mr. Kraft forgot to sign the food order.

12:42.647 --> 12:43.811
And it was tamale day.

12:43.982 --> 12:45.263
Who would have thought?

12:45.442 --> 12:48.313
Guess Mr. Kraft is in charge of
more stuff than just detention.

12:48.528 --> 12:49.692
I'm hungry,

12:49.863 --> 12:52.188
and I'm not very nice
when I'm hungry.

12:52.364 --> 12:54.821
So it's a nutrition problem.

12:56.869 --> 12:59.906
Mr. Kraft, all these students
are very hungry,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.409
and there is no food.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.583
Well, you're a girl. Go fix lunch.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.162
That's Neanderthal.

13:06.335 --> 13:07.831
"That's Neanderthal."

13:08.004 --> 13:11.420
Mr. Kraft, the students need lunch,
and they need it now.

13:12.466 --> 13:13.961
Well...

13:15.552 --> 13:16.584
I have

13:17.345 --> 13:22.091
two Rolos, a jawbreaker,
some ABC gum

13:22.266 --> 13:23.382
and I'm willing to share.

13:23.559 --> 13:25.600
You are the vice principal
of this school,

13:25.770 --> 13:28.522
and it is your responsibility
to order the darn food.

13:28.689 --> 13:30.184
- Is not.
- Is too.

13:30.357 --> 13:32.065
Not, not, not, not, infinity.

13:32.233 --> 13:34.772
I can't talk to you.
This is a ridiculous conversation.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.483
- Is not.
- Oh, don't.

13:37.655 --> 13:39.400
I'm hungry.

13:40.116 --> 13:42.951
We have the statewide exams
coming up in a week,

13:43.118 --> 13:44.993
and one of the things
that's gonna be on them

13:45.162 --> 13:47.037
is quadratic equations.

13:47.206 --> 13:49.080
<i>This is Vice Principal Kraft.</i>

13:51.668 --> 13:53.127
He makes three times what I do.

13:53.294 --> 13:55.453
<i>Now that I have your attention,
I just wanted to say</i>

13:55.630 --> 13:58.252
<i>that even though lunch today
was, like, totally not my fault,</i>

13:58.466 --> 14:00.045
<i>I'm gonna make it up to you guys</i>

14:00.259 --> 14:03.130
<i>by letting you go home
for three weeks.</i>

14:03.303 --> 14:04.549
Three weeks?

14:04.721 --> 14:06.347
We'll never get ready for the exams.

14:06.515 --> 14:08.140
We'll lose our accreditation.

14:08.308 --> 14:10.468
But we'll catch up on our soaps.

14:11.937 --> 14:15.519
Oh, uh, your uncle is calling you
on the pay phone.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.644
Uncle Salem?

14:19.777 --> 14:20.809
What'd you find out?

14:20.986 --> 14:22.565
You didn't mix the potion
with hemlock,

14:22.738 --> 14:23.769
- did you?
- Course not.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.490
<i>That's the only way it could mess up,</i>

14:25.698 --> 14:28.653
unless you mixed it with caffeine,
but no one's that stupid.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.823
I did. I mixed it
with caffeine in iced tea.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.496
Oh, no. Everyone knows you don't
put an aging potion in with caffeine.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.541
Did the Surgeon General
make that warning?

14:37.709 --> 14:39.999
It causes the container
to absorb the potion.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.294
Every time Mr. Kraft
makes a pitcher of iced tea,

14:42.464 --> 14:43.710
he gets more potion.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.756
I have to get that carafe.

14:45.925 --> 14:47.468
Yes, and be careful, 99.

14:47.635 --> 14:48.751
What?

14:48.928 --> 14:50.672
You are so young.

14:59.062 --> 15:00.142
Ha!

15:00.313 --> 15:02.307
Mr. Kraft, I didn't know
you were in here, uh,

15:02.482 --> 15:05.436
but then again, I didn't look
in what appears to be your fort.

15:05.609 --> 15:07.105
But since you are here, I'll go.

15:07.278 --> 15:10.114
Tag. You're it.
You're never gonna catch me.

15:10.281 --> 15:12.440
You're right, I'm very bad
at this game. I quit.

15:13.492 --> 15:16.742
Tag, I'm it. All right, um, pain tag.
If I catch you, I give you pain.

15:16.953 --> 15:19.908
- I don't wanna play. Ow!
- Indian burn. You're it.

15:20.081 --> 15:23.747
- Heavy pillow tag.
- No fair. No fair. Ow!

15:24.960 --> 15:26.705
I'm telling.

15:30.507 --> 15:31.837
Did you get the carafe?

15:32.009 --> 15:34.086
No, but apparently I have cooties.

15:34.261 --> 15:35.921
There has to be some other solution.

15:36.137 --> 15:38.759
Good luck.
I've torn that book apart looking.

15:39.432 --> 15:40.464
Literally.

15:40.641 --> 15:43.180
Well, there's only one thing to do.

15:43.352 --> 15:44.764
I'm gonna have to ask an aunt.

15:44.937 --> 15:47.144
Might I suggest Aunt Bea?

15:47.314 --> 15:48.892
She was nice.

15:51.526 --> 15:53.152
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.649
I didn't hear you come in.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.814
Well, I'm in,

15:56.989 --> 15:58.650
and I'm studying witch stuff,

15:58.824 --> 16:00.154
and I need some help.

16:00.326 --> 16:03.778
Sure. Uh, don't touch that green goo.
It's a little radioactive.

16:04.872 --> 16:06.995
Let's say a person
put a spell on another person,

16:07.165 --> 16:09.538
and they thought that spell
would end at a certain time,

16:09.709 --> 16:10.741
but it didn't.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.330
- Who'd you put a spell on?
- Aunt Zelda, it's hypothetical.

16:15.340 --> 16:18.376
So how would you reverse
this hypothetical problem spell?

16:18.550 --> 16:23.260
Well, first,
I'd tell my aunt what's going on.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.305
Where's Aunt Hilda?
Maybe she can help.

16:25.516 --> 16:28.054
- She's on a date with Mr. Kraft.
- Really?

16:32.563 --> 16:35.482
Willard, would you mind
getting off the floor?

16:36.942 --> 16:38.567
I'm bored.

16:38.735 --> 16:41.441
Then why don't we talk?
I had a great time the other night.

16:41.613 --> 16:43.523
I don't remember
when I laughed so much.

16:44.491 --> 16:46.283
What are you doing?

16:47.035 --> 16:48.446
Oh.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.413
Here.

16:52.706 --> 16:54.166
Ecch.

16:55.292 --> 16:56.704
Oh, here comes our food.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.294
- Here's your petite fillet.
- Thank you.

17:00.463 --> 17:02.955
Here's your chocolate sundae.

17:03.883 --> 17:06.506
- Anything else?
- More cherries.

17:08.887 --> 17:11.842
Wish I was brave enough
to order dessert for dinner,

17:12.015 --> 17:13.760
but then I like my health.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.844
- I want that.
- Oh.

17:16.019 --> 17:18.474
I'm the same way.
Someone's food always looks better,

17:18.646 --> 17:20.106
but not this time.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.519
Oh, how romantic.

17:24.736 --> 17:26.528
- Are you okay?
- I wanna go home.

17:26.738 --> 17:28.777
Well, I'd like to finish my meal.

17:28.989 --> 17:31.362
- I wanna go home.
- Stop that.

17:31.575 --> 17:33.652
Would your date like some crayons?

17:33.869 --> 17:37.120
Um, no, but could you just put
a rush order on the cherries?

17:37.289 --> 17:38.949
Sabrina.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.031
You know, these days

17:41.208 --> 17:43.747
a lot of restaurants
will put leftovers in a bag for you.

17:44.670 --> 17:47.127
- Where's Mr. Kraft?
- Oh, he's asleep in the car.

17:47.298 --> 17:49.540
The ride really tuckered him out,
poor little fella.

17:49.758 --> 17:51.301
Well, I'm pretty tuckered out myself.

17:51.468 --> 17:53.260
- Good night.
- Hold it.

17:53.428 --> 17:55.172
What spell did you put on Willard?

17:55.388 --> 17:58.011
Before you start pointing fingers,
remember one important fact:

17:58.183 --> 17:59.843
Sabrina put me up to it.

18:00.017 --> 18:02.888
Are you gonna finish that
potato morsel on your collar?

18:04.855 --> 18:06.267
What are you making?

18:06.440 --> 18:07.769
It's an anti-youth potion.

18:07.983 --> 18:12.063
One part prune juice,
one part Miami Beach tap water,

18:12.236 --> 18:16.152
with just a pinch
of Buddy Ebsen salt.

18:19.701 --> 18:21.161
I'll give him the medicine.

18:21.328 --> 18:24.034
Hate to say this, but I can't wait
to get the old Mr. Kraft back.

18:24.206 --> 18:26.413
You don't change
people's personalities.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.873
And if you do,
you don't mix it with caffeine.

18:31.170 --> 18:33.839
All right, Mr. Kraft,
let's get your dignity back.

18:34.048 --> 18:35.958
Here comes the choo-choo train.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.510
Choo-choo, choo-choo...

18:40.804 --> 18:43.759
That noise is going on
your permanent record, Sabrina.

18:43.932 --> 18:45.261
What's going on here?

18:45.433 --> 18:46.763
How did I end up here?

18:46.935 --> 18:49.890
We were at dinner and, uh,
you got sick and passed out.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.731
Oh, dear Lord,
what happened to you?

18:52.940 --> 18:55.313
Had to dive across the nachos
to keep you from hitting your head.

18:55.484 --> 18:57.976
- Good one.
- Oh, thank you.

18:58.153 --> 19:01.238
Listen, I insist on buying you
another dinner,

19:01.406 --> 19:03.565
and I'm not leaving here
until you say yes.

19:03.783 --> 19:05.658
- Say yes.
- Oh, all right.

19:05.868 --> 19:07.280
Wonderful.

19:07.495 --> 19:09.370
Sabrina...

19:11.039 --> 19:14.207
Something very odd
is going on here,

19:14.376 --> 19:16.369
and I can't help but think
you were responsible.

19:16.586 --> 19:19.624
Oh, well, you know,
that could be sign of a concussion.

19:20.757 --> 19:23.046
Well, we will visit
this area again, hmm?

19:24.760 --> 19:27.715
- Hilda, Tuesday?
- Mm-hm.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.924
Black Angus night
at the stockyards.

19:38.231 --> 19:41.067
If I come home with a steer,
it's sleeping in your bedroom.

19:44.069 --> 19:46.359
Really? Too much iced tea?

19:46.530 --> 19:49.152
It's the only thing my doctor
could think of.

19:49.324 --> 19:50.654
Here you are.

19:51.702 --> 19:54.157
- Detention? What for?
- New policy.

19:54.328 --> 19:57.864
Detention is now based solely
on personal resentments.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.585
Hi, Libby.

20:00.752 --> 20:02.460
Libby, what's the matter?

20:02.627 --> 20:03.660
What's the matter?

20:03.879 --> 20:06.964
I thought you believed
in the work of cheerleaders,

20:07.132 --> 20:10.632
but it turns out
that you are no more than an--

20:10.802 --> 20:12.132
An educator.

20:13.637 --> 20:16.046
Libby, isn't that a little harsh?

20:16.223 --> 20:18.762
Especially since you
haven't seen this yet.

20:21.145 --> 20:24.265
Three tickets to the Loire Valley
cheerleading symposium?

20:24.439 --> 20:27.394
Oh, Mr. Kraft, I'm...

20:27.567 --> 20:29.276
I'm all choked up.

20:29.486 --> 20:31.396
I'd give you something
for your dry throat,

20:31.571 --> 20:34.276
but I'm afraid our drinking fountain
is still broken.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.872
Well, looks like the Mr. Kraft
we've always known and loved is back.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.957
Yeah.
It's nice to have lunch and lights

20:46.125 --> 20:47.834
and a clean school.

20:48.002 --> 20:50.245
I guess we should
be grateful for him.

20:52.757 --> 20:55.711
- What--?
- Now I'm grateful.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.265
Okay, so I ruined the ski trip
for everyone,

21:05.434 --> 21:06.894
and I turned the school
inside out.

21:07.103 --> 21:10.389
But isn't being grounded enough?
Why do I have to mix this stuff up?

21:10.606 --> 21:13.561
It's just Zelda's way of teaching us
to respect the labtop.

21:13.776 --> 21:16.693
Why would she have me make
Limburger frappé?

21:16.861 --> 21:19.353
This stuff smells like something
that's already been eaten.

21:19.531 --> 21:22.948
Come on, how bad could it be?
It's just cheese.

21:23.118 --> 21:25.075
Ugh! Oh...

21:25.285 --> 21:26.318
Salem?

21:26.495 --> 21:29.248
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda.
Help! Salem's fainted.

21:29.998 --> 21:33.000
Oh, Salem, you are brilliant.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.498
Mm. Mm...

21:34.670 --> 21:36.959
Easy, easy. Don't choke.
