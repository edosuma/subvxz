WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:05.222
.

00:05.266 --> 00:08.660
- Today is the start of a
brand-new corporate initiative:

00:08.704 --> 00:11.011
"Going the Extra Smay-zle!"

00:11.054 --> 00:12.490
- A couple questions.
- Mm-hmm.

00:12.534 --> 00:16.059
- What is a smayzle,
how do you go the extra one,

00:16.103 --> 00:17.582
and what if you probably
weren't going

00:17.626 --> 00:19.889
the standard amount
of smayzles to begin with?

00:21.847 --> 00:24.502
- Uh, I think it's supposed
to be "Going the Extra Smile,"

00:24.546 --> 00:26.287
'cause that rhymes with "mile"

00:26.330 --> 00:29.159
and we have "aisles."
- One interpretation.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.726
- Basically they just want
everyone to start

00:30.769 --> 00:32.728
making small talk
with the customers.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.384
- Oh, come on.
It'll be fun!

00:36.427 --> 00:40.866
You just put on your best
Cloud 9 smile...

00:40.910 --> 00:42.172
And then talk about whatever.

00:42.216 --> 00:45.175
You know,
ask them about their purchases

00:45.219 --> 00:48.091
or ask about
their Thanksgiving plans.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.658
Oh, you can talk
about your pets.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.181
- Does that include
exotic pets?

00:51.225 --> 00:52.748
- Oh, Sandra,
for the last time.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.707
There's nothing exotic
about a cat with dementia.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.535
- The point is,

00:57.579 --> 01:01.452
human connection is what sets
us apart from online retailers.

01:01.496 --> 01:02.975
That's our secret weapon.

01:03.019 --> 01:06.022
- Oh, so this is how corporate
plans on taking down Amazon?

01:06.066 --> 01:09.069
By having Sandra
talk about her dying cat?

01:09.112 --> 01:11.114
- He has plenty of time.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.814
♪

01:15.858 --> 01:19.514
- Ugh. I hate making
small talk with old people.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.385
It's always a two-hour fiasco
about their children

01:21.429 --> 01:23.474
or what race they're worried
about getting robbed by.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.086
- It's so weird how they always
have the most time to talk,

01:26.129 --> 01:28.088
and yet, the least time
to live.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.219
- Mm.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.742
Rock
- Yeah.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.181
Boom!
Have fun.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.532
Hi.
- Hi.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.229
- This lady is going
to be helping you out today.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.665
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.930
- Hello.
both: Hi.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.630
- Oh, I'm great.
- Good.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.719
- We're in town
visiting our son.

01:50.762 --> 01:53.156
He's in medical school.
- That's lovely.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.506
- You wouldn't believe
some of his stories.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.769
I'm just going to give you
the top ten.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.947
- Ah, that is a fantastic drill
you're looking at.

02:01.991 --> 02:05.255
- Yeah. What's the difference
between this one and the F590?

02:05.299 --> 02:06.648
- Uh, you know, well,

02:06.691 --> 02:08.302
they--they both have
their pros and cons.

02:08.345 --> 02:12.132
You know, this one is red,

02:12.175 --> 02:13.872
so that's a plus--

02:13.916 --> 02:15.309
if you like red.

02:15.352 --> 02:19.574
It also drills, like,
super deep holes.

02:19.617 --> 02:22.054
Uh, or--or less deep,
you know,

02:22.098 --> 02:25.710
if you just don't push
it in all the way.

02:25.754 --> 02:26.929
- Hello there.

02:26.972 --> 02:29.758
I just wanted to say
thank you for supporting

02:29.801 --> 02:32.326
local retail instead
of shopping online.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.024
- To be honest, I probably
would've bought this on Amazon,

02:35.067 --> 02:36.547
but I needed it today.
- Ah.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.332
- Oh, you know they have
same

02:38.375 --> 02:39.637
- Okay, nobody asked you.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.291
- Don't you have to pay
for Prime?

02:41.335 --> 02:42.814
- Ah!
- Oh, it's totally worth it.

02:42.858 --> 02:45.208
You get free shipping
plus movies, music.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.644
- We--we've got music.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.820
Go check out
our CD selection.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.822
It's all on clearance.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.303
Wait, what are you doing?
Don't--don't put it back.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.479
- No, I don't want it anymore.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.481
- Well, too late.
You touched it, you bought it.

02:57.525 --> 03:01.398
- Yup, yup.
It's pretty comfortable.

03:03.357 --> 03:06.316
He's on his feet
all day at the hospital.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.405
Did I mention
he's in medical school?

03:08.449 --> 03:11.234
- Mm-hmm, you did.
Quite a few times.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.453
- Uh, my hand just
touched your leg,

03:12.496 --> 03:14.846
but didn't mean anything.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.370
- I know.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.546
- You know, my cousin
deep-fried a turkey last year,

03:18.589 --> 03:20.200
but he didn't thaw it
completely.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.462
Huge explosion.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.203
Bunch of his face
just melted clean off.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.682
He's had to have a ton
of surgeries.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.902
We keep telling him he looks
good as new, but

03:26.945 --> 03:29.078
really, he kind of looks like
one of those baseball mitts

03:29.121 --> 03:30.340
from the 1920s.

03:30.384 --> 03:34.344
Anyway, be safe.
Gobble

03:35.606 --> 03:37.260
- Is that your idea
of going the extra smile?

03:37.304 --> 03:38.957
Talking about your cousin
with no lips?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.263
- Uh, he has lips.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.743
They used them
to reshape his eyebrows.

03:41.786 --> 03:42.787
You know, forget it.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.224
This is a stupid
initiative anyway.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.355
- Hey, I'm there with you.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.661
I do not like small talk,

03:46.704 --> 03:48.402
and I hate smiling
all day like an idiot.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.273
- Yeah, well it's harder
for you with that weak face.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.753
How is my face weak?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.450
- I don't know,
it's just not strong.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.322
- It's as strong as yours.
- Oh, please.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.019
I have complete
musculofascial control.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.064
When I was seven,
I corrected my own lazy eye.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.370
I could out-smile you any day.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.937
Okay, whatever.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.765
- No.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.854
- Yeah,
that would be stupid anyway.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.812
I mean,
how would we even test it?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.379
- See who could smile
the longest,

04:09.423 --> 04:11.425
but I don't see how
we'd enforce that.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.165
- It'd have to be
the honor system.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.819
- Yeah, the honor system
would work, but

04:14.863 --> 04:16.691
why would we even do it?
What're we doing it for?

04:16.734 --> 04:18.780
- I like Scotch.

04:18.823 --> 04:19.607
- So do I.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.522
I guess we're doing this?

04:21.565 --> 04:23.263
- I guess so.
- On three.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.526
One, two, three.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.791
- God, you have a creepy smile.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.706
- So this one,
if I'm remembering correctly,

04:31.749 --> 04:34.274
has a metal
half-ratcheting chuck

04:34.317 --> 04:37.102
for superior
bit-gripping strength.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.321
Yeah--oh, there it is,
right there.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.583
I was right.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.106
- One question is...

04:41.150 --> 04:42.847
Are these backwards compatible

04:42.891 --> 04:45.285
with the older generation
18

04:45.328 --> 04:47.591
'Cause I'm installing a...
- Guess how he scored on his--

04:47.635 --> 04:49.811
- Oh, God.
- An AC unit in my shed,

04:49.854 --> 04:51.552
and when it comes down to--

04:51.595 --> 04:52.944
- Oh, okay.
Oh, God.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.122
Scores only go to 528.
That's it.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.950
- Hey, guys.

04:58.994 --> 04:59.995
What are you doing here?

05:00.038 --> 05:01.562
- Oh, how do you know...

05:01.605 --> 05:02.824
- This is who we're visiting.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
It's our son who's
in medical school.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.435
No--no, no.
This is--

05:05.479 --> 05:06.523
- Hi!
Hi, I'm Jonah.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.873
It's nice to meet you.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.311
- Oh.

05:13.356 --> 05:13.530
.

05:13.574 --> 05:16.185
- ♪ You've got someone
there to say ♪

05:16.228 --> 05:18.100
♪ I'll show you

05:20.972 --> 05:24.498
- So, uh, just to clarify,
this is your son?

05:24.541 --> 05:26.413
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.066
- Oh.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.460
And--and how long have you
been in medical school?

05:30.504 --> 05:31.896
I'm a third year.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.682
- Wow. Three years.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.379
That's...wow.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.250
- Listen, do you carry
men's briefs?

05:38.294 --> 05:40.644
We need a men's small
or a boys' husky.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.385
I think we can probably

05:42.429 --> 05:44.039
just find it on our own,
so thank you

05:44.082 --> 05:45.867
so much for all
of your help,

05:45.910 --> 05:48.217
uh, kind madam.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.175
- Okay, uh--thank you.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.527
- Children's underwear
in aisle 12.

05:54.571 --> 05:55.920
- Hi, I need to return this.

05:55.964 --> 05:59.141
It was a...anniversary present
for my wife,

05:59.184 --> 06:01.535
but...I don't need it anymore.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.407
Oh, you know what?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.670
We don't take back
engraved jewelry. Sorry.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.672
It was really expensive,

06:08.716 --> 06:10.544
and now I've got to pay
for a divorce

06:10.587 --> 06:12.328
and I don't have a job
anymore

06:12.372 --> 06:14.939
because her new boyfriend
is my now-ex-boss.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.550
- Yikes, that's rough.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.901
- It's not funny.
I'm going through hell.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.859
My life is literally hell.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.818
- Hey, man,
I don't think it's funny,

06:23.861 --> 06:25.689
I'm just in this contest--

06:25.733 --> 06:27.474
- Yeah, screw you!

06:28.475 --> 06:30.172
- Um...

06:30.215 --> 06:32.783
I don't need
this dog collar anymore.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.746
Mm-mm.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.225
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.403
- Oh, Dr. Simms.
Where are Richard and Marilyn?

06:43.446 --> 06:46.362
- Uh, I told them I needed
a new 13-pin phone charger,

06:46.406 --> 06:48.364
so that should confuse them
for a little bit.

06:48.408 --> 06:52.063
Uh, look, I know this may all
seem a little weird...

06:52.107 --> 06:53.935
- Insane.
Cuckoo Bananas.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.937
- Okay, uh, long story short:

06:55.980 --> 06:57.329
I dropped out
of business school,

06:57.373 --> 06:58.896
my parents kept asking me
what my plan was,

06:58.940 --> 07:01.595
and I didn't want to tell them
I was working at Cloud 9--

07:01.638 --> 07:03.466
that's not a judgment
on working here.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.599
It's just my parents have
really high expectations.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.470
- That's so weird.
It was my parent's dream

07:07.514 --> 07:09.472
that I would stock shelves
for a living one day.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.256
- Anyway, I told them
that I was thinking

07:11.300 --> 07:15.043
about going to medical school,
which I was...kind of,

07:15.086 --> 07:16.653
and then one thing
led to another

07:16.697 --> 07:19.264
and now I'm doing
my rotation in hematology.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.443
- I think it's--
uh, it's the study of blood--

07:23.486 --> 07:26.620
or not--mm, not blood itself,
but, like, the vessels or--

07:26.663 --> 07:28.360
I don't know.
I have to Google it again.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.232
- Got it.
So they're in electronics?

07:30.275 --> 07:31.625
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
wait, wait, wait.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.496
You're--you're not going
to say anything, are you?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.019
- Oh, come on.
Give me some credit.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.630
I'm not going to out you
to your parents.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.501
Okay.
- But I do think

07:38.545 --> 07:40.372
it would be highly
irresponsible to let them leave

07:40.416 --> 07:42.418
without getting more
embarrassing childhood stories.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.464
Ideally, they have photos.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.378
- No, no, that's--
you don't need to...

07:46.422 --> 07:49.556
- Hello there.
How's your day going?

07:49.599 --> 07:50.861
- Fine.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.950
- Wow, you've got quite
the full cart, huh?

07:52.994 --> 07:57.999
You got a shovel, a tarp,
and some duct tape and...

07:58.042 --> 08:01.742
kitchen knives
and garbage bags...

08:01.785 --> 08:04.048
and a saw?

08:05.310 --> 08:08.096
Whoo.
Big Thanksgiving plans?

08:08.139 --> 08:10.533
- Just a small dinner
with my mom.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.840
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.494
Where do you keep your bleach?

08:15.930 --> 08:19.281
I think
we're actually out of bleach.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.544
- It's fine.
I'll get it online.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.763
- No!

08:22.806 --> 08:26.375
Wait, we--we have bleach.
It's aisle nine.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.508
- You've been very helpful.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.552
Thank you.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.819
- His older brothers convinced
him it was a nude pool.

08:35.863 --> 08:39.867
And so everyone at the Radisson
saw his tiny little tush.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.566
- Okay, well, everybody's tush
was tiny at that age, so--

08:43.610 --> 08:45.786
- He was so embarrassed that he
tried to hide under the water

08:45.829 --> 08:49.093
until everyone left, and he...
He almost drowned.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.400
- Jonah was always
almost drowning.

08:51.443 --> 08:52.880
- True.
- It was a cry for attention.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.186
- Okay guys, I don't think
the nice sales lady

08:55.230 --> 08:56.666
needs to hear all of this.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.190
- You know, actually, the more
I know about your life,

08:59.234 --> 09:01.323
the more able I am
to direct you to items

09:01.366 --> 09:03.238
that would assist
you in your living space.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.066
- I don't see how
that's helpful.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.416
- Well, you've never worked
retail, so...

09:07.459 --> 09:09.374
- Well, he's in medical school.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.593
- He is.
- Mm-hmm.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.204
- So, tell me
about extracurriculars.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.424
I'm thinking
captain of the football team?

09:15.467 --> 09:16.947
- Not exactly.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.735
I would have
never guessed that.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.260
- Excuse me, do you know
anything about drills?

09:25.303 --> 09:27.436
- Oh, God, no.
Ew.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.617
You know how you always tell us

09:34.661 --> 09:37.141
not to leave
the Sudafed case open,

09:37.185 --> 09:38.578
especially when teens
are around,

09:38.621 --> 09:40.623
'cause one of them might
distract you

09:40.667 --> 09:42.669
with skateboard tricks
and all of their friends

09:42.712 --> 09:45.976
will come
and steal all the Sudafed?

09:46.020 --> 09:47.325
Well, that happened.

09:47.369 --> 09:50.111
Are you serious?

09:50.154 --> 09:51.808
- Guess it is kind of funny.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.376
I was so scared that
you'd be mad at me.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.291
- No, I am mad.
You're an idiot.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.772
"You're an idiot!
I'm so angry!"

10:00.861 --> 10:03.298
I love our jokey
"I hate you,

10:03.341 --> 10:05.343
but I really love you"
back-and-forth.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.956
- No, this is not a joke.
I really, really hate you.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.698
- I "hate" you too.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.656
- He would brush the hair

10:13.700 --> 10:15.397
of these strange
horse figurines

10:15.440 --> 10:17.704
hour after hour, and then
when we'd take them away,

10:17.747 --> 10:18.792
he'd start crying.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.663
- Oh.
- He was always crying.

10:20.707 --> 10:24.493
- Hey! I am so glad to see that
you're engaging with customers,

10:24.536 --> 10:27.322
but I need you
to go empty the rat traps.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.716
They're overflowing with--
- Okay, I will get on it.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.501
- No, I was talking--
- No, Glenn, I want to do it.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.895
- Because...

10:34.938 --> 10:36.548
I love it.

10:36.592 --> 10:40.509
Okay.
Knock yourself out.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.642
Um, if she's doing the rats,

10:42.685 --> 10:45.122
then I need you to go clean
the men's washroom.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.778
Someone did not make it to the
toilet in an explosive way.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.301
- Excuse me, why are you
telling him

10:50.345 --> 10:51.694
that he should
clean the bathroom?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.522
- Because I'm the one
who did it,

10:53.565 --> 10:55.829
uh, and you caught me
red-handed,

10:55.872 --> 10:58.483
so I'm gonna go ahead
and take care of that

10:58.527 --> 11:00.485
and see you guys at home.

11:00.529 --> 11:04.707
- We're his parents.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.840
- Oh--oh, my!

11:06.883 --> 11:09.364
Oh, it's...
It's so nice to meet you.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.714
We have a lot of employees
go through this store...

11:11.758 --> 11:12.846
- Glenn!

11:12.889 --> 11:14.238
- But it has been
such a pleasure--

11:14.282 --> 11:15.979
- Oh!

11:16.023 --> 11:17.851
- Ow!

11:17.894 --> 11:19.330

11:30.559 --> 11:31.734

11:31.778 --> 11:33.127
You were about
to give away his secret,

11:33.170 --> 11:34.737
and I didn't
know how else to stop you.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.348
- So you pegged me
in the face with a yam?

11:37.392 --> 11:39.002
Why didn't you just shout,
"Hey Glenn,

11:39.046 --> 11:41.091
I really need to talk to you?"

11:41.135 --> 11:42.614
- 'Cause that
wouldn't have worked.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.138
- Oh, yeah.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.706
Hey, so, uh,
let me explain.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.534
- I already told him.
- Yeah, I don't get it though.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.886
Why are you lying to your
parents about working here?

11:52.929 --> 11:55.018
- I just--I didn't want
to disappoint them.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.455
- Why would your parents
be disappointed

11:57.499 --> 11:58.848
about you working at Cloud 9?

11:58.892 --> 12:00.545
- No I--th-they,
they, they, well--

12:00.589 --> 12:04.245
- Because they're crazy people.
Their expectations are insane.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.768
- Yeah.
- They wouldn't have been happy

12:05.812 --> 12:07.074
unless he was president.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.772
- Yeah.
- That's ridiculous.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.556
You're too short
to be president.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.863
Even Jimmy Carter was 5'10".

12:13.907 --> 12:15.473
- It's a good point.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.127
Glenn, do you mind if
I clock out early

12:17.171 --> 12:18.781
so I can leave with them?

12:19.913 --> 12:22.785
- Sure, I guess.
- Thank you so much.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.744
- And why did you
throw it at my face?

12:24.787 --> 12:27.790
Why didn't you just throw
it at my legs or my chest?

12:28.573 --> 12:31.794
- Because it had
to be the face.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.535
- Yeah, I know.

12:35.102 --> 12:38.192
It's too bad,
'cause that really hurt.

You're, like, psychotic.

He's just a wuss who's
still afraid of his parents.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.907
What are they going to do,
take you off

12:57.951 --> 12:59.604
their cell phone plan?
- I'm not on their plan.

12:59.648 --> 13:00.954
We're on a shared family plan,

13:00.997 --> 13:02.694
which actually
saves them money.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.131
And you guys are telling me

13:04.174 --> 13:05.785
none of you have ever
lied to your parents?

13:05.828 --> 13:07.308
- I once stole money
from my mom,

13:07.351 --> 13:09.092
and then I broke a window
and flushed her jewelry

13:09.136 --> 13:10.833
down the toilet to make it
look like a robbery.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.182
- Hmm.
- I used to tell my parents

13:12.226 --> 13:14.097
I was meeting friends
at Imo's Pizza,

13:14.141 --> 13:17.448
but really, I was eating
alone at Imo's Pizza.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.276
- My parents still think
I'm straight.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.497
I could be straight.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.281
Oh, my God, a football.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.805
Throw!

13:25.848 --> 13:27.415
- But at some point,
aren't you gonna

13:27.458 --> 13:28.851
have to tell them
you work here?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.461
- Not necessarily.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.637
I mean, why upset them
when I'm not going to be here

13:32.681 --> 13:33.682
that much longer anyway?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.772
- I don't know,
but it's not like

13:36.816 --> 13:38.034
I'm going to be here
forever, you know.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.427
This is all temporary.

13:39.470 --> 13:42.647
- Oh. It's all temporary.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.345
- No, no, not at all, no, I--

13:44.388 --> 13:48.044
there are definitely parts
of this job that I really like.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.612
I just don't know
where my life is going.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.961
- Cool.
- That's not--I--

13:52.005 --> 13:53.310
- I have to go put bait
in the rat traps.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.009
- No, you don't have--
- I love it.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.403
I hate to see her go,

13:59.447 --> 14:02.885
but I love
looking at her butt.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.845
See?
This is easy for me.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.152

14:09.196 --> 14:11.546
- Hey, Tiffany! Wow.
Long time no see.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.635
- Yeah, it's been, like,
three and a half years.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.072
That long.
What have you been up to?

14:16.116 --> 14:19.989
- Well, mostly raising
this little guy.

14:20.033 --> 14:24.428
Garrett, this is Jaylen.
Jaylen, this is your daddy.

I was the father of her child

just so I would
momentarily stop smiling

Interesting.

for two boxes of crackers

15:01.248 --> 15:02.510

15:02.553 --> 15:04.816

Please, can we let it go?

15:04.860 --> 15:08.951
- Hey, um, we're leaving, so...

15:08.995 --> 15:10.779
- Yes, thank you
for all the help.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.172
- Yeah, we told the cashier

15:12.215 --> 15:14.043
that you helped us, so...

15:14.087 --> 15:16.219
- Great, well, we don't work
on commission,

15:16.263 --> 15:18.091
but I appreciate it.
Have a heavenly day.

have to do this.

Yup, he works
in the café all the time.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.806

and he studies--

Listen,
we're gonna get through this.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.836

people are staring.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.272
Could you...

- Look, we just want what's
going to make you happy,

16:11.579 --> 16:14.495
and if managing this store
makes you happy,

16:14.538 --> 16:15.757
then we're happy.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.541
- Oh, I'm--I'm not the manager.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.760
I'm just a floor worker.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.286
- I'm just gonna sit
for a second.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.162
- This is hard to watch.

16:34.036 --> 16:34.471
.

16:34.515 --> 16:37.474
- There is no easy way to say
this so, here it goes.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.302
You're fired.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.956
- Yup.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.481
You are grossly incompetent
and unpleasant to be around,

16:44.525 --> 16:46.614
so why don't you just go
be a doctor

16:46.657 --> 16:48.398
or something else great.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.748
- Okay, I--I see
what you're doing here.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.273

imagination be your guide.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.500
I appreciate whatever this is,

but you don't have
to worry about me, okay?

17:05.198 --> 17:07.504
I'm--I'm staying.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.073
- Okay.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.554
But I know that things
have been rocky

17:13.597 --> 17:15.469
between you and your
parents lately,

17:15.512 --> 17:17.166
so if you need
a father figure...

17:17.210 --> 17:19.386
- No, that's--thank you,
thank you.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.388
I really--that's kind, but, um,
I'm okay.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.129
- Yup.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.348
- Because we could go out back
and throw a ball around or...

17:25.392 --> 17:27.394
- That's--that's okay.

17:27.437 --> 17:30.353
- Hey, um...

17:30.397 --> 17:33.182
listen,
don't be too mad at Jonah.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.097
I mean, if you think about it,

17:35.141 --> 17:37.839
he wants to please you so much

17:37.882 --> 17:41.408
that he spent three years
constantly lying to you.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.887
That's got to make you
feel good.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.847
- Yeah, not really, no.
Mm-mm.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.981
- Well, look,
he was lying about his job,

17:50.025 --> 17:51.505
not about who he is.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.377
He's a good person.
That is real.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.901
She's right.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.556
I mean, if he's happy and
Natalie is okay with it...

17:59.600 --> 18:00.862
- Well...
- We should be happy too.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.081
- You're right.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.212
Who's Natalie?

18:03.256 --> 18:05.084
- His fiancée.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.871
Oh, I didn't know...

18:09.914 --> 18:14.745
uh, and how long has--
has he been fiancée'd?

18:14.789 --> 18:16.530
- Well, um,
they've been dating

18:16.573 --> 18:18.314
about three years now.
- Three years.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.403
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.449
- Wow, that's--that's--
that's as long

18:22.492 --> 18:25.104
as I've known him.
Um...

18:25.147 --> 18:27.410
I'm sorry, I'm just--
I'm very weirded out

18:27.454 --> 18:28.672
that I have never met her.

18:28.716 --> 18:29.891
- Well...
- Well, we haven't either.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.284
She's always off
somewhere filming.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.546
- No, she's an actress.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.418
Have you seen
"The Garden States"?

18:35.853 --> 18:37.855
- Mm-hmm.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.770
- Natalie...

18:39.814 --> 18:41.250
I'm sorry,
what's her last name?

18:41.294 --> 18:43.165
- Portman.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.645
- Mm-hmm.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.516
- Natalie Portman.
- Right.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.476
- Jonah told you that he's
engaged to Natalie--

18:49.519 --> 18:51.391
- Natalie Portman, mm-hmm.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.915
- Oh, my God.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.047
He was lying.
He was lying about that too.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.049
- Oh--
- No, I don't--I don't know.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.355
- I knew it was weird.
I knew it.

18:59.399 --> 19:00.791
I read in that magazine article

19:00.835 --> 19:02.271
that she was married
to some dancer.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.622
Actually,
now that I am thinking about it

19:05.666 --> 19:09.104
I have seen Natalie
in our store.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
- And she was all up on Jonah.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.328
Now--now I get it.
It totally makes sense.

19:15.371 --> 19:19.941
It was so nice
meeting you people.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.072
- Well...

19:21.116 --> 19:22.726
that explains why
she wouldn't hug me

19:22.770 --> 19:23.988
in the airport that time.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.730
Who?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.079
- Do you ever think
about all the things

19:28.123 --> 19:29.777
you can't do 'cause
you're in a wheelchair?

19:29.820 --> 19:32.171
- Sometimes I do.
Sometimes I do.

19:34.085 --> 19:37.045
Your sister Denise
is a lot prettier than you.

19:37.088 --> 19:40.266
And that's why your mom gave
her the grandfather clock.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.616
- Hmm. You may have a point.

19:42.659 --> 19:43.834
Do you ever think about

19:43.878 --> 19:45.227
how no one's ever
going to love you

19:45.271 --> 19:47.011
and you're going to die alone?
'Cause personally,

19:47.055 --> 19:48.361
I think you are going
to die alone.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.754
- Oh.
Well, speaking of alone,

19:50.798 --> 19:52.278
remember that time
when you were a kid

19:52.321 --> 19:55.019
and your dad abandoned you
at a gas station?

19:55.063 --> 19:57.065
- Yup.
Mm-hmm.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.198
It's hard to forget.
- Yeah.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.638
Why are we doing this?
- It's a bet.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.248
This is fun.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.381
- So, yeah, no, I told my mom
I was "going to a movie

20:08.424 --> 20:10.426
with Natalie Portman,"
and she thought I was seeing

20:10.470 --> 20:12.341
a movie with Natalie Portman,

20:12.385 --> 20:14.952
and she was so happy and proud.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.999
- And she believed you,
which is the weirdest part

20:18.042 --> 20:19.914
because you are
so out of her league.

20:19.957 --> 20:23.178
- I am. I'm completely
out of her league.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.485
Well, no more secrets.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.704
Except, of course...

20:27.748 --> 20:29.184
- Yes, no, obviously.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.056
I mean, we don't--
you know, just until...

20:32.100 --> 20:34.363
we know...
- Right, I mean, we--

20:34.407 --> 20:37.366
we wouldn't want
anybody to...

20:37.410 --> 20:39.107
to...

20:41.327 --> 20:44.112
- Hey, guys, uh...

20:44.155 --> 20:47.202
so Jonah and I
have kinda been dating.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.726
- Okay.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.380
- Hasn't that been going on
for a while?

20:51.424 --> 20:55.384
- No--well, yes, but we'd been
keeping it secret.

20:55.428 --> 20:59.040
Now we're...announcing it.

20:59.083 --> 20:59.910
- Yep.

21:03.131 --> 21:06.177
- Nothing.
- We just thought you'd...

21:07.135 --> 21:08.397
Never mind.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.051
- Okay.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.662
I lost my favorite pen.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.665
It's a blue pen.
The ink is also blue.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.319
- Click.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.538
- On it.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.454
- Wow. I gotta say
that was underwhelming.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.978
- Yeah, I thought
that'd be so much bigger.
