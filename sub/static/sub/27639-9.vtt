WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.103
Can I get this, Paula?

00:05.172 --> 00:07.773
You need to say "please"
to you babysitter.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.541
I'm not his babysitter.
I'm his mom.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.043
No.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.778
But, ah, he call you Paula.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.546
-That's my name.
-Ah, okay.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.583
-Okay. See you.
-Thank you.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.119
[woman] Let's go.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.056
[scoffs] Another child ruined.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.724
-Yeah. Can you believe?
-[door closes]

00:25.726 --> 00:27.592
It's about respect.
Look at us,

00:27.595 --> 00:28.927
you're one of my oldest friends.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.329
I would never dream
of calling you anything
but Mr. Kim.

00:30.397 --> 00:33.732
Me, too, Mr. Mehta.
See? Respect.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.200
Exactly.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.170
"Yobo" sounds informal.
[chuckles]

00:38.238 --> 00:40.539
Yobo is not my name.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.542
But I-I've heard Mrs. Kim
holler it from the rafters.

00:43.610 --> 00:47.813
No. Yobo, it's, uh,
kind of my cute love nickname.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.783
Only, ah, Mrs. Kim call me that.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.785
Of course. I remember! Appa.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.621
No. Appa mean "daddy."

00:56.624 --> 00:58.824
You call me Mr. Kim
out of respect,

00:58.892 --> 01:00.592
or because you forget my name?

01:00.660 --> 01:02.227
God, this tea is incredible.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.730
-I must...
-My name is Sang-Il,
my very good friend.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.434
I'm so sorry, Sang-Il.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.071
That's okay, uh...

01:14.842 --> 01:18.343
Maybe we stick with, ah,
Mr. Kim and Mr. Mehta.
Out of respect.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.011
You didn't even try.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.046
[slurps noisily]

01:21.115 --> 01:23.048
[theme music playing]

01:41.168 --> 01:42.534
[Appa] Ha-ha!

01:42.603 --> 01:45.470
Mr. Chin just accept me
as a friend on Facebook.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.873
-My first one.
-Uh-huh.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.442
Oh. I think I make a mistake.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.810
Lots of Mr. Chin accept me.

01:51.812 --> 01:52.978
Yeah, how I stop this?

01:53.046 --> 01:54.046
That's nice.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.448
Ai, what you doing?
Just relax.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.783
How can I relax
when we have a guest?

01:58.852 --> 02:02.387
Mrs. Ada not guest.
She a cleaner.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.089
[Umma] You sure
you don't need
any help in there?

02:04.091 --> 02:05.257
No, thank you.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.226
If she make you
so uncomfortable,

02:07.294 --> 02:10.362
why you tell Mrs. Lee
Mrs. Ada can clean for us, too?

02:10.430 --> 02:12.564
So Mrs. Ada can have a job.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.100
How can I know having cleaner
is so much work?

02:15.102 --> 02:17.035
Stop. Sit.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.445
We are doing good thing
for Ada family.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.380
[Mrs. Ada approaches]

02:28.382 --> 02:29.948
-[gasps] Oh.
-[Appa starts, sighs]

02:30.016 --> 02:31.616
And where would you like these?

02:31.685 --> 02:32.751
Oh. That's garbage.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.386
Ai, ai! Not garbage.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.087
What? It's a beach vacation.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.190
No one going
on a beach vacation.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.525
Unless somebody doing
vacation... sneak attack.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.626
[gasps] Yobo!

02:41.695 --> 02:44.930
I find a very good deal
on resort in Cuba.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.065
Fancy. Almost a two-star!

02:47.067 --> 02:48.734
Maybe you'll meet Brad Pitt?

02:48.802 --> 02:52.103
And all alcohol include,
except liquor and wine.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.239
Oh! It's too much.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.141
Everyone deserves
to spoil themselves.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.010
That's right, hmm?

02:58.078 --> 03:00.179
Well, I better get back
to that toilet.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.649
So Umma was surprised.
Did she cry?

03:04.718 --> 03:06.351
When she see
they have a waffle bar

03:06.353 --> 03:07.686
and a mint on pillow,

03:07.688 --> 03:10.388
-she do full ugly cry, uh?
-[chuckles]

03:10.457 --> 03:12.757
Good morning, Janet.
Mr. Kim.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.559
[Janet] Hi, Mr. Mehta.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.994
Ah. What's this?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.496
Oh, my business cards.
Just got 'em made.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.898
-What do you think?
-Hmm.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.833
What's that font? MarkerFelt?

03:21.901 --> 03:23.602
I'm more of
a ChalkDuster man, myself.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.904
I tell her, first,
you get a business,

03:25.906 --> 03:28.573
-and then you get card.
-[Mr. Mehta] I disagree.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.009
Janet must quickly
build her online presence

03:31.077 --> 03:32.678
before her profession
becomes obsolete.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.413
-Yeah. I join Facebook.
-Hmm.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.716
Which reminds me,
you can just "like" my photos.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.018
-You don't have to write
"This you Appa" every time.
-[sighs]

03:40.087 --> 03:41.787
You know, my son
is getting married.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.458
Yeah. I remember hearing
something about that.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.393
Maybe. Or not.
So much going on.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.462
How would you like
to take the engagement photos?

03:50.530 --> 03:52.697
I don't think
you want that Janet, huh?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.800
She take, ah, sad photo
of a dirty sewer grate

03:55.869 --> 03:57.536
and sneaker hanging from tree.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.703
It's okay, Appa. Seriously.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.238
I know what's going on.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.073
You two are trying
to drive up the price.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.009
Well, it worked.
Three hundred dollars.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.377
I don't think, ah, Janet--

04:05.445 --> 04:07.479
Four hundred
and not a penny more.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.047
-Deal.
-Oh.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.883
I would have gone to 1,000.
[chuckles]

04:19.260 --> 04:21.559
Seriously,
where are all the people
that wash these?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.695
We wash them. After we use them.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.197
Right, right, right.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.834
Hey. Really bad news, guys.

04:28.902 --> 04:32.771
So, I don't want anyone
to get too, you know,

04:32.839 --> 04:34.039
but Amanda Brookfield is coming.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.109
Handy's regional manager.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.845
Is this because
I broke the printer?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.112
And if this is about the mugs,
I totally wash them.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.082
[snorts, laughs]
Oh, my God, your faces.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.451
I'm just yankin' your chain.
It's just a check in.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.620
Amanda wants to see
the new branch
and her best bud, Sharon.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.089
-Who's Sharon?
-I'm Sharon.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.125
Amanda called me it once
and it kind of stuck.
Oh, she's the best.

04:54.128 --> 04:57.128
We like the same authors,
have the same number of siblings

04:57.197 --> 04:59.431
and both say the word "sammich."

04:59.499 --> 05:01.132
Copy that.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.801
I mean, sure,
she's the regional manager,

05:02.869 --> 05:03.802
but just don't be all like...

05:04.437 --> 05:06.071
But just be.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.039
Absolutely.
One cream, two sugar?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.642
Ah! Ah-mah-zing. Pew, pew.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.878
Cuba look so beautiful.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.313
I'm going to try
so many new thing,

05:15.382 --> 05:19.918
pickleball on beach, mojito,
maybe even Cuban cigar.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.586
You not smoke cigar.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.188
Toronto Umma don't smoke cigar,

05:23.190 --> 05:26.291
but Cuba Umma
is island-time style.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.293
[both laughing]

05:28.362 --> 05:31.563
Hope I not make you
look too bad, Mr. Lee.

05:31.565 --> 05:35.334
Ah, not every husband
can make their wife dream
come true. [chuckles]

05:35.802 --> 05:37.168
Nope.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.372
I'm so jealous.
We never go anywhere exciting.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.773
You deserve vacation, too.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.007
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.210
Treat yourself.
Not too expensive.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.711
Yobo!

05:46.714 --> 05:48.346
You want to go
to Cuba with them?

05:48.349 --> 05:52.384
-No, I just meant, uh...
-Yes. Yes!

05:52.452 --> 05:54.186
[gasps, exclaims]

05:56.189 --> 05:58.456
[all laughing]

05:58.525 --> 06:00.325
-[gasps] Shh, shh.
-Oh.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.327
Hey, guys. What's up?

06:02.395 --> 06:03.795
Just something about Shannon.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.363
Shut up, Stacie! God!

06:05.432 --> 06:07.199
No, I can totally joke
about the boss now.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.868
I'm one of you guys,
the back gang.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.472
Okay. Omar does a pretty great
impression of Shannon.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.006
I gotta see this.

06:15.008 --> 06:18.543
Alright. "Hey, Jungster.
Can you set aside
two Van Meisters

06:18.612 --> 06:22.046
for the old conference-ino
this weekend.
We are so busy."

06:22.115 --> 06:24.549
-[laughter]
-[Jung] That's pretty good,
that's pretty good!

06:24.618 --> 06:26.684
You gotta get the hands
in there, though, like, ah,
[clears throat]

06:26.687 --> 06:30.155
"Hey, Stace of base!
Listen, we are totes backed up

06:30.223 --> 06:32.023
from that whole sitchers
from earlier.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.260
But if you could just,
like, grab me a coffee,
that would be a-mah-zing."

06:35.328 --> 06:37.862
-[laughter]
-Nailed it.
Whatever your name is.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.232
-Yeah. It was okay.
-Okay. Check this one out.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.033
[clears throat] I'm Peter.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.302
I like setting up
digital portals
for secure document sharing.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.104
[laughs]

06:46.573 --> 06:48.106
Who's Peter?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.041
It's this guy I worked with
at my old job.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.378
Trust me. It's bang on.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.953
[knock on door]

07:02.889 --> 07:03.855
[sighs]

07:09.395 --> 07:10.695
Hey.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.297
Hey.

07:12.299 --> 07:16.134
Just wondering if we could talk
about the engagement photos.

07:16.136 --> 07:20.472
Sure. I'd be happy
to discuss things
with... clients.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.041
Please, step into my office.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.311
You know, I swear
I had no idea

07:26.379 --> 07:27.879
my dad was going
to ask you to do this.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.048
Okay.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.683
If you want, I can just tell him
you're sick, or double-booked.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.719
Why? This is just another gig.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.455
Come on, Janet.
You're telling me this
won't be a little weird?

07:36.523 --> 07:39.891
Maybe for you.
But once I sling
the old camera on,

07:39.893 --> 07:41.493
I check my emotions at the door.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.661
Uh, not that I have
any emotions about this.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.497
But, if I did,
they'd be checked.

07:45.565 --> 07:49.034
At the door. Which they aren't.
Because they don't exist.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.535
-Okay.
-Mm.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.003
-If you're sure.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.072
-[door opens]
-I'll see you at the shoot.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.842
-Hi.
-[Raj] Hey.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.546
-Are you kidding me?
-It's not what you think.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.348
What do we think?
What's going on?

08:03.416 --> 08:05.316
I'm new here. Catch me up!

08:05.385 --> 08:07.853
That guy, Raj,
broke Janet's heart.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.654
Relax! He was here for a job.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.190
I'm taking his photo
with Divya. Pre-wedding.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.958
You're taking
his engagement photos?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.794
Well, if you want
to put a label on it.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.562
[sighs] This is worse
than I thought.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.998
I get it.
We've all got our "Raj."

08:20.000 --> 08:21.666
A guy you know
there's no future with,

08:21.735 --> 08:23.868
but you just can't resist
his sad, puppy dog face.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.837
That's not me and Raj.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.006
[stammers] Yeah, who is that?

08:28.074 --> 08:29.975
Oh, nobody babe. [chuckles]

08:32.412 --> 08:34.546
This is work.
That's it. Okay?

08:35.949 --> 08:37.215
Thanks.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.183
Okay, you know,
because it sounded like

08:39.252 --> 08:40.351
you were talking
about someone specific.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.153
[giggles] Boop.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.895
Might be okay.
Mrs. Lee is good company,

08:49.963 --> 08:52.430
and, uh, Mr. Lee is very quiet.

08:52.498 --> 08:53.698
Don't even know he's there.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.501
He won't be there,
because he's not coming.

08:56.569 --> 08:59.571
Tell them resort doesn't allow
boring robot man.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.105
Okay, okay.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.876
Yeah, this is our vacation, hmm?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.712
Omelette station,
seven-person hot tub!

09:07.780 --> 09:09.848
Fresh new towel every day.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.517
Just throw on bathroom floor
and they pick up.

09:12.585 --> 09:13.552
[Mrs. Ada] Sounds wonderful.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.521
Yeah, but so wasteful,

09:16.590 --> 09:20.992
so we use same towel whole trip
and make our own omelette.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.695
-You find you sweater?
-Yes. Thank you very much.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.363
-Good night.
-Good night.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.801
I not make my own omelette.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.309
The Civic's ready. Oh!
And I washed the mugs.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.678
Never know
when a regional manager
might stop by.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.281
So I hear you do
a pretty funny impression of me.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.817
Oh! It... That's all done
out of affection.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.485
Oh, I know. I love impressions.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.220
Come on, I really
want to see it. Please?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.557
Okay. Uh...

09:52.626 --> 09:56.160
"Hey, cats. It's the Shansters.
Pew, pew, pew. A-mah-zing."

09:56.229 --> 09:57.562
[laughs] That's funny.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.864
I see where you were going
with the hand things.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.367
It makes me want
to do you right now.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.103
-What?
-I do an impression of you.
Wanna see?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.038
Well, I don't really
have a thing,

10:07.107 --> 10:08.506
so I don't know
if there's much to do.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.441
Oh, yeah, you definitely
don't have a thing.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.911
"Hey, Kimch.
Just hittin' the gym. Hard.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.879
Copy that.
Right, right, right.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.348
Body spray.
Go sports! Brutal!"

10:17.417 --> 10:20.085
[Kimchee laughs] Oh, man!
She's got you good.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.725
Oh. Hi.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.627
I heard you don't want
to vacation with us.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.462
What? No.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.331
Ah, we just have, uh...

10:33.400 --> 10:37.068
Janet, huh? If we not here,
she throw big party.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.037
Turn out
she have lots of friend.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.872
Can you believe? [chuckles]

10:40.874 --> 10:43.307
Oh. Nothing to do with
"Mr. Boring Robot Man"?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.343
No. I like Mr. Lee.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.679
-[gasps]
-I mean, uh, who?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.714
We is very fun people.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.749
Even more fun on vacation.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.551
Yeah, I know. I just, uh...

10:53.553 --> 10:55.620
We thought... And Janet...

10:55.688 --> 10:58.456
Next time you have something
to say, say it to our face.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.030
-Mrs. Lee?
-[door opens, closes]

11:05.098 --> 11:07.331
-What happen?
-Why you tell Mrs. Lee

11:07.400 --> 11:08.766
I don't want vacation
with Mr. Lee?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.601
I never say that.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.372
I tell her we cancel trip
because store is slow
and we can't afford.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.408
Then how she know
I call Mr. Lee
boring robot man?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.544
-[Appa starts]
-I sorted through
your expired medicine.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.881
Do you want me
to throw them out?
Or can anyone take them?

11:36.262 --> 11:37.628
That's probably enough, right?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.230
Don't be silly, Raj.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.865
Janet needs more shots
than this, right?

11:40.933 --> 11:44.435
Yup. I could do this
all day, every day.
I love love.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.438
Aww. So, are you seeing anyone?

11:47.441 --> 11:50.708
Not one guy.
More like lots of guys.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.410
Every day is a new adventure.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.245
-Really?
-[Janet] Totally.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.882
I mean, it's great
you two are lockin' it down.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.552
But I'm having too much fun
to commit to one person.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.153
Forevah.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.524
Okay. I think we're done.

12:06.592 --> 12:08.426
Wait, no, guys!
We forgot the bling pic.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.028
Can't we skip that one,
Div? It's cheesy.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.596
It's romantic.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.101
Yeah. Very Pinterest.
You should go for it.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.038
Okay. Go this way.
Like this, right?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.041
Move a little
so we can see Raj.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.077
Like this?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.713
No, that's too much.

12:28.782 --> 12:32.050
Okay. You just want
to stand like this...

12:37.257 --> 12:39.424
Oh, my gosh, that's perfect!
Thank you, Janet.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.959
[Janet] Yeah.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.535
It wasn't even anything like me.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.870
Like, I'm the only person
that ever leans against things?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.939
Imitation's a form
of flattery, all right?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.407
When we do an impression of you,

12:56.476 --> 12:57.809
-it's like we're giving you
a big hug.
-Wait.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.511
-You do them, too?
-Hmm?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.179
Well, go ahead.
Let's see it. Show me.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.415
Okay. This one's a classic.

13:09.556 --> 13:13.157
-What?
-'90s heartthrob poses.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.693
Right, right, right.
We're doing Jung?

13:15.761 --> 13:18.329
No, 'cause you guys
don't look or sound
anything like me.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.498
-Copy that
-Oh, very funny.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.166
Look, you're a good guy.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.436
Having a sense of humour
about it shows you're
an even better guy.

13:25.504 --> 13:28.239
-Be that guy.
-[sighs] Right,
right, right.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.376
Now you're doing you.
It's pretty good actually.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.112
I still can't believe Mrs. Ada
gossip behind our back.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.781
This is why
I'll never hire a maid.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.316
The scandal is unavoidable.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.285
Well, at least now
we can go on a perfect vacation

13:41.354 --> 13:43.354
without "dead plant," Mr. Lee.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.523
Oh! Mr. Lee is the worst.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.925
Always comes in the restaurant.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.527
No matter where
he is in his meal,
he always needs a toothpick.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.995
-[Appa] Hmm.
-It's revolting.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.998
Now we have to be careful
around Mrs. Ada
"blabber talker."

13:54.067 --> 13:56.034
We don't know for sure it's her.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.269
But we could know.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.604
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.974
Next time she is around,
we talk about something,

14:03.042 --> 14:06.644
and if it go back to Mrs. Lee,
then we know Mrs. Ada
is a blabber talker.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.581
That is so sneaky.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.517
I love you so much right now.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.553
[Mr. Chin] Save it
for Cuba, you two.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.054
By the way, Mrs. Kim,

14:17.123 --> 14:19.257
you still haven't accepted
my Facebook friend request.

14:19.725 --> 14:20.992
I know.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.731
[Janet] We're almost done.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.165
Want to take a picture of me
running away?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.168
Mm. If that's what you want.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.770
I miss you.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.240
I think your fiancee misses you.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.676
[Divya] Hey, hey, guys,
these fish don't bite, do they?

14:38.678 --> 14:41.746
Becau... Oh! Yup.
They're biting me. [laughs]

14:41.814 --> 14:43.447
I'll be right there.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.050
Seriously. I can't stop
thinking about you.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.885
Well, you were able
to stop thinking about me
long enough

14:47.954 --> 14:49.787
to get engaged to Divya.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.423
Come on! You, of all people,
know the pressure to
make our parents happy.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.358
-Yeah. But--
-Back there, when
I was posing with you,

14:54.427 --> 14:57.061
that's the only part
of this day that's felt right.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.963
Didn't you feel it, too?

14:59.031 --> 15:00.798
[Divya] Guys,
I'm getting cold feet.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.866
What?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.202
Yeah. This water is freezing.

15:04.270 --> 15:07.705
Oh, is that seaweed? Oh, nope.
Yep, it's biting me, too.

15:07.773 --> 15:10.341
[sighs] I feel like
we've been doing this for hours.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.343
We have.
And your hair's
paying for it.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.811
[sighs]

15:13.879 --> 15:15.480
Ah! Nice try.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.315
[Shannon] Here's the garage.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.884
We clean the cars back here.
But you probably knew that.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.019
-And this is
our back manager, Terence.
-Hi.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.888
And our former
assistant manager,

15:23.956 --> 15:26.824
now valued
back gang member, Jung.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.426
Hi. It's a pleasure.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.461
It's nice to meet you both.
I've heard a lot about you.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.862
Oh. All good things, I hope.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.998
[chuckles] Nothing but.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.167
And we're happy
to have you back
in the Handy team.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.706
And I'm glad that
you guys brought Amanda
up to speed on everything.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.175
It's kind of our job.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.877
Such a fun group here.
Great morale.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.714
Yeah, no doubt.
But, uh, goes both ways.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.749
Right. Right...

15:51.817 --> 15:54.885
Oh, here we go.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.656
Hi, I'm Amanda!
This is my work BFF Sharon,
whose real name is Shannon.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.358
Want a sammich?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.093
That's about all I can remember.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.895
Oh! And you walk like this.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.898
Good morale! Good morale!

16:07.667 --> 16:08.666
[Jung chuckles]

16:10.936 --> 16:12.670
I don't get it.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.705
-Yeah, you do.
-No, I don't.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.674
Let's go back to my office.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.676
Hey, fun prank, guys.
[chuckles]

16:18.744 --> 16:20.044
[Amanda] So, it's Shannon?

16:20.112 --> 16:21.679
[Shannon] Sometimes.
It's not a hard-and-fast rule.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.881
-Wow.
-What?

16:28.587 --> 16:31.289
What's that you say, Yobo?
You feeling sick?

16:31.357 --> 16:34.225
Yeah. I think we may have
to cancel Cuba trip.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.727
-[vacuum cleaner whirring]
-[Appa exclaims]

16:36.796 --> 16:38.162
Okay, I handle.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.332
It's so sad.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.833
-[turns off vacuum cleaner]
-What?

16:42.836 --> 16:47.772
Uh, I just say,
it's so sad about Mrs. Kim
and her heart condition.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.407
Oh, no.

16:49.475 --> 16:50.708
[moaning awkwardly]

16:50.776 --> 16:52.176
That's terrible.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.179
So, anyway,
we have to cancel big trip

16:55.181 --> 16:59.216
because of, uh,
her very serious
heart condition.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.951
I am so sorry to hear that.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.054
Good. Okay. See you.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.223
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

17:12.865 --> 17:14.799
Now, that's gorgeous.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.402
Yeah. The light was amazing.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.805
Oh, he was right
about this photo.
It's cheesy.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.007
I mean the pose,
not the picture.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.544
I don't know.
It's sort of sweet.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.013
Maybe I'm overwhelmed,
but do you think that
we're rushing into this?

17:30.316 --> 17:31.849
Um...

17:31.917 --> 17:34.352
Like, when I think
about the big picture,
what's it going to look like?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.821
Well, I guess, maybe,
if you are having doubts then...

17:36.889 --> 17:39.057
Did Raj say anything to you
about what he wants?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.995
I think you guys
should figure out
what you want together.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.832
Yeah. The one on the log.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.602
I mean, I look better
in this one, but
Raj looks great here.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.005
Oh. You're talking
about the actual picture.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.841
Yeah. We don't
just want digitals.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.577
We want to blow one up
for our living room.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.546
Right. That sounds... nice.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.648
[squeals] I'm so excited!

18:04.651 --> 18:07.452
Thank you, Janet.
You are so talented.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.959
Hey, guys. Listen,
I'm really sorry about...

18:15.027 --> 18:16.861
Everything's fine.
Amanda was pretty cool about it,

18:16.929 --> 18:19.163
and, on the plus side,
at least she's calling me
Shannon now.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.464
Well, that's good.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.201
And, listen,
I know I overreacted,
but I'm over it now.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.337
I mean it. I can handle it.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.005
Okay, who's this?

18:28.073 --> 18:30.141
"I just got promoted
to assistant manager
and I'm insecure about my job,

18:30.209 --> 18:31.642
so I take it out on Terence."

18:31.710 --> 18:32.877
Not cool, man.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.278
Lighten up, man.
It's just fun.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.013
Okay, one more.

18:36.081 --> 18:39.016
"Oh, hey! I'm Shannon.
I'm super-friendly and chatty,
and the best boss ever."

18:39.084 --> 18:40.818
Aww, that's sweet.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.554
"Kitty-cat, kitty-cat,
I'm dating Alejandro,
but, ooh, is that Jung?

18:43.623 --> 18:44.889
Flirt, flirt, flirt."
[chuckles]

18:44.957 --> 18:46.424
Okay, we're shutting this down.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.927
[Mrs. Lee] I heard
about your heart condition.

18:49.995 --> 18:54.665
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea! Here.

18:54.733 --> 18:58.402
My umma's special root tea.
It taste terrible, but it work.

19:00.372 --> 19:01.506
[sobs softly]

19:01.574 --> 19:03.574
Oh, oh. Mrs. Lee. I--

19:03.643 --> 19:05.910
Mrs. Kim is healthy, 100%.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.678
Such a positive spirit.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.915
No, no. I was never sick.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.018
-But I hear--
-It's a fake story
that we tell Mrs. Ada.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.988
Why you do that
to such nice person?

19:18.057 --> 19:20.624
Ah, she's not a nice person.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.661
She take a private conversation
and blabber talking to you.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.331
I didn't hear from Mrs. Ada.
I hear from Mrs. Ko.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.368
But who tell Mrs. Ko?
Blabber-talking Ada.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.803
Oh, no, I do.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.173
I need excuse
to get out of brunch
with Mrs. Ko.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.177
But still, she hurt
you feeling by saying

19:40.246 --> 19:42.580
we think you husband
is a boring robot man.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.549
I didn't hear that
from Mrs. Ada.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.318
You post on Facebook.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.886
-What?
-[Mrs. Lee] There.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.592
Oh. That's a private message
to Mr. Chin!

19:54.660 --> 19:56.427
It's on you wall.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.897
Same as you post
about telling Mrs. Kim
you helping Mr. Chin,

19:59.965 --> 20:01.566
when really you go golfing.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.400
What?

20:03.469 --> 20:07.171
Uh, point is everybody
stretch truth, huh?

20:07.239 --> 20:09.106
So, everybody should forgive.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.844
[Appa] Yeah.

20:13.912 --> 20:17.681
Would you and Mr. Lee
like to join us in Cuba?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.718
Thank you. But we book
our own vacation.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.456
Mr. Lee always
want to see Sarnia,
Ontario's Chemical Valley.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.524
[Mrs. Ada] Sounds wonderful.

20:27.593 --> 20:28.659
[Appa chuckles nervously]

20:28.728 --> 20:29.794
Hello.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.934
-[door opens]
-[Mrs. Ada] Oh.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.736
Oh. I thought
you were going
to be in Cuba.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.471
But they oversell flight.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.739
-So we get bump.
-Mm.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.140
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.975
[Appa] Mm. Why?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.544
They give us a voucher
for anything we want
at the airport restaurant.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.946
[Umma] So, then we wait
for next flight,

20:49.014 --> 20:50.481
but again they oversell.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.416
So, this time,
we volunteer to get bump.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.619
But then they cancel,
and they give us cash money

20:55.688 --> 20:59.257
and half-price discount
at Holiday Inn near airport.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.692
Sounds wonderful.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.827
Oh, by the way,
I can't work next week.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.996
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.999
The Lee's are taking us
to Sarnia. So generous.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.735
We are going
on a ice cream
and chip-truck tour.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.104
Oh. I like a chip truck.

21:14.107 --> 21:18.008
I like ice-cream.
Sound wonderful.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.711
And so does your trip, hmm?
To the airport. [chuckles]

21:22.782 --> 21:24.749
