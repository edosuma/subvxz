WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.271
Hey, did we get new towels?

00:03.304 --> 00:04.505
'Cause the one I just used

00:04.538 --> 00:07.808
was like drying off
with a wicker basket.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.977
No.
No, I got new fabric softener.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.679
It's supposed to be good
for the environment.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.048
All right, we got to go
through this again?

00:14.082 --> 00:16.250
"Good for the environment"
means it sucks.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.851
"Recyclable" --
It falls apart.

00:17.885 --> 00:22.056
"Organic" -- You pay twice as
much, and it tastes like crap.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.624
That's a nice run, Dad.
Yeah.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.559
Yeah. That's right up there
with your, uh,

00:25.593 --> 00:29.597
"you burn more calories driving
than walking" theory.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.433
It's about adrenaline.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.336
Sweetheart.
Our results are here.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.471
Results?
Yeah, we took one
of those DNA tests.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.972
With just a little bit
of saliva,

00:39.006 --> 00:40.674
they can unravel your DNA

00:40.708 --> 00:44.378
and solve the mystery of your
ancestry for generations back.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.915
I'm 98% English.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.385
Whoa. Wait.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.588
According to this,
I'm 16% Viking?

00:54.622 --> 00:55.956
Viking?
Hold the cheese.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.692
Let me see that thing.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.594
Whoa.
This is incredible.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.531
If you're 16% Viking,
that makes me, uh...

01:03.564 --> 01:05.966
I guess -- I mean, you double
it up for the parent, right?

01:05.999 --> 01:07.901
So you'd be -- Double it up.
That would be, uh...

01:07.935 --> 01:10.704
You just bang it up twice.
You go, "Boom, boom."

01:12.906 --> 01:14.308
Why --
I'm totally blanking on this.

01:14.342 --> 01:15.343
Why am I blanking?
I don't e--

01:15.376 --> 01:17.077
It's 32%.
32%.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.879
32%.
That means I'm 1/3 Viking.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.549
Great. I've already played three
sports, and now I'm a Viking?

01:21.582 --> 01:22.783
Boys will never talk to me.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.952
Yeah.
It's 'cause you're a Viking.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.356
Hey, be proud of your
Nordic heritage, all right?

01:28.389 --> 01:29.457
We're Vikings.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.493
We're brave, we're strong,
and we are fearless.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.895
Do you still want me
to pick up new fabric softener?
I do.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.430
Uh, and get the one
with the little teddy bear

01:36.464 --> 01:38.399
that rolls around
in the towels. Thanks.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.435
Snuggles. That's what
all the Vikings used.

01:41.469 --> 01:46.374
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:46.407 --> 01:47.708
Vanessa:
Morning, Rootger.

01:47.741 --> 01:51.179
Listen, a, uh -- A local
magazine is doing a story on me,

01:51.212 --> 01:52.346
and they're gonna be
coming by,

01:52.380 --> 01:53.881
taking pictures of me
in the office.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.483
Oh, great. Yeah.
Yeah.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.951
But if Kevin calls, you don't
need to mention it to him.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.353
I'll handle it.
Just tell him I'm busy.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.354
Got it.
Okay, great.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.422
All right.
Thanks.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.924
-Kevin!

02:03.957 --> 02:05.459
Vanessa's busy.
Huh?

02:05.493 --> 02:08.729
Hey!
Uh...you're here.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.964
I thought you were tailing
Mr. Martin all day today.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.065
I did.
Uh-huh.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.934
Uh, it turns out he's cheating
with the FedEx lady.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.603
I didn't even have
to get out of the car,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.571
which is great 'cause I had
a bagel sandwich going.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.207
Nice, nice.
Little...

02:20.208 --> 02:22.009
Th-- The thing is, I --

02:22.042 --> 02:22.810
Hey, Vanessa.
Hey...

02:22.843 --> 02:24.345
uh, Kristen.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.748
Um, this is Kristen
from Long Island Insider.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.917
She wrote a story
about Monkey Fist.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.786
So, this is Kevin,
and this is Rootger.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.955
So, do you want
to just set up?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.124
Yeah. I was thinking we
could shoot you on the couch

02:37.157 --> 02:39.126
with the logo
in the background?
Great.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.928
Photo shoot.
Heads-up would've been nice.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.963
Not loving what I'm wearing,
but let's do it.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.131
Let's make it happen.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.999
There you go.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.401
Uh, okay.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.969
I guess you can just stand
next to Vanessa.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.170
Yeah, right?
This will be good.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.839
Maybe I'll go, like, arms
folded or something.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.509
Really pop the biceps out.
A little Superman style, huh?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.010
Yeah. Very cool.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.646
Hey, uh, Kristen,
call my name.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.913
Old photography trick.
Watch this.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.282
Kristen, call my name.
I'm sorry?

03:01.315 --> 03:02.683
You got to call my name --
When I --

03:02.716 --> 03:04.084
When I'm back, like, this way,
you got to call my name.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.419
He's not gonna shut up
until you do it,

03:05.453 --> 03:06.587
so you just might
as well do it.
Yeah.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.955
Okay. Kevin?
Yeah, what's up?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.223
Take it. Snap it.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.991
Snap that shot.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
You got it? Shabang!

03:12.660 --> 03:14.362
And -- And, Kevin,
let's do one

03:14.395 --> 03:15.796
where you move back
just a little bit.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.931
Sure, absolutely.
Let's make it happen here.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.800
Just move back
one more step.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.834
Sure, no problem.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.102
Perfect.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.471
Hey, Kristen,
call my name again.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.672
Do it again. Yeah.
Kevin.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.809
**

03:28.842 --> 03:29.943
Oh. Hey, babe.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.012
Can you remind me what
we're doing tomorrow night?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.715
Oh, that's right -- "Dear
Evan Hansen" on Broadway.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.918
Rhetorical question.
Boom!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.687
Actually, I just read
a bad review,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.622
and I was thinking
we should skip it.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.392
What?
Joke from Chale! Boom!

03:46.460 --> 03:48.429
Actually, it's not a joke.
We do have to skip it.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.897
I, um

03:49.930 --> 03:52.032
You remember I said my
Aunt Tracy was coming to visit?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.634
Yeah, you said
that was next week.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.102
I might've got
the dates mixed up.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.271
So we have to miss
the hottest show on earth

03:57.305 --> 03:59.307
because you have
to babysit your aunt?

03:59.340 --> 04:02.976
Yes, and --
How do I say this nicely?

04:03.010 --> 04:06.414
She's not quite right
in the head.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.550
So unless we can find someone
to look after her,

04:09.583 --> 04:10.751
we're stuck.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.752
All right.

04:11.785 --> 04:12.853
Fixed the dryer.
Dove right in.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.788
I took
the whole thing apart.

04:14.822 --> 04:18.392
Turns out it was just unplugged,
so you live, you learn.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.596
Hey, Uncle Kyle,

04:22.630 --> 04:25.165
how would you like to go on
a date with an English lady?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.668
I'm in.
So, give me the lady deets.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.571
Well, she's my aunt, Tracy.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.508
Yeah, the whole "aunt" thing
doesn't work for me.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.810
I, uh, took
my buddy's aunt out once.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.078
They said she was fun,

04:38.111 --> 04:41.081
which apparently meant
she had skin like a lizard.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.383
Okay, you know what,
Uncle Kyle?

04:42.416 --> 04:43.717
I didn't wanna have
to do this,

04:43.751 --> 04:44.785
but if you don't help us out,

04:44.818 --> 04:47.220
I will never hem
your fireman pants again.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.222
But I'm odd-shaped.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.559
With my wide hips
and my crazy inseam,

04:51.592 --> 04:52.793
I can't go
to a regular tailor.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.395
Well, that's not
my problem.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.863
Fine.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.130
When are we talking?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.299
Tomorrow night.
Ah, can't do it.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.668
Oh, crap.
Oh, sorry.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.935
I was looking at 2014.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.036
I'm back in.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.540
**

05:06.574 --> 05:07.841
Kevin:

05:07.875 --> 05:09.710
Hey, Rootger.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.311
Okay, you caught me.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.313
I was trying
to read the magazine.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.515
W

05:14.548 --> 05:16.550
Okay,
you beat it out of me!

05:17.785 --> 05:19.787
The article
they did on us.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.988
You're not going
to like it.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.960
"Vanessa Cellucci, the gutsy,
street-smart former cop

05:26.994 --> 05:28.796
who runs Monkey Fist.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.498
She's charming,
she's sassy as"...

05:30.531 --> 05:32.132
Is this -- Is this whole thing
about Vanessa?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.635
No, you're in there.
Halfway down.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.203
"Vanessa has
a motley crew of assistants.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.571
There's Kevin Gable,

05:37.605 --> 05:40.273
the husky, hyperactive guy
who never stops talk--"

05:40.307 --> 05:42.543
Husky?
What am I, 12?

05:42.576 --> 05:43.911
Hey, guys. What's up?

05:43.944 --> 05:44.845
Oh, nothing.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.246
Just playing
a little game

05:46.279 --> 05:48.982
called "Find Kevin
in the Magazine Article."

05:49.016 --> 05:50.784
I don't seem to be
in here at all.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.285
Hey, maybe I'm
in a picture.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.888
Oh, yeah, there I am.
Nope. That's the printer.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.427
Look, she wanted to do
an article about me.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.696
I didn't know
what to say, okay?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.834
Here's what you say --
We're partners, okay?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.669
I'm not
your "husky assistant."

06:08.702 --> 06:09.970
And by the way,
I've lost weight.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.539
I don't know
if you noticed at all,

06:11.572 --> 06:13.741
but I've been hitting the gym
like three, four times a week.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.443
Not this week,
'cause I tweaked my back,

06:15.476 --> 06:17.511
but next week, I'll probably
hit it four or five, maybe,

06:17.545 --> 06:20.013
depending on
how busy Thursday is.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.215
Did you even read
the article?

06:22.249 --> 06:23.250
I mean, look.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.952
"Forty under Forty:

06:24.985 --> 06:27.888
Up and Coming Business Owners
of Long Island."

06:27.921 --> 06:29.957
"Forty under Forty"?
Yes!

06:29.990 --> 06:32.893
40 entrepreneurs
that are under 40.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.863
So obviously
I had to leave you out.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.731
But you're over 40.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.332
Right, yes.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.134
Okay.
By a couple of years.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.304
You're over 45
by a couple of years.

06:44.337 --> 06:47.007
By the way, people mistake me
for being under 40 all the time.

06:47.040 --> 06:47.875
Oh, really? Name one.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.543
Uh, how about Freddy
at the car wash?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.645
Just this morning, he was like,
"What are you "

06:51.679 --> 06:53.747
And I'm like,
"No, but thank you, Fred."
Mm.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.749
These eye crinkles
that you got going on?

06:55.783 --> 06:56.750
Dead giveaway.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.085
My eye crinkles?
Yes.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.920
By the way, what do you got
going on the side of your eyes?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.021
'Cause if you're done
using 'em,

07:01.054 --> 07:02.089
I'd like
to rake the leaves.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.957
That's what I like to do
with those.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.595
Okay,
before this turns ugly --

07:07.628 --> 07:10.063
or just after --

07:10.097 --> 07:12.165
I am sorry that I went
behind your back, okay?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.433
Okay. Yes.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.769
This article can really put
Monkey Fist on the map.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.337
And I agree.
All right, look.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.508
I'm sorry I said the comment
about your eye crinkles

07:20.541 --> 07:21.842
and -- and
your turkey-neck thing.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.011
Turkey neck?
What turkey

07:24.044 --> 07:26.614
I never said that out loud,
did I?
No, you did not.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.249
Point is, I'm sorry. That's
what I'm basically saying.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.018
Okay.
I'm sorry.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.420
You should stop talking
at this point.
Okay. Yeah, good point. Okay.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.996
Here is the Casey file.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.466
Anything else you need
from your husky assistant?

07:46.500 --> 07:49.603
Oh, come on.
I thought you let this go.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.671
Let what go?

07:50.704 --> 07:54.041
It was one article
in a local magazine.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.509
Nobody cares.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.044
Hey, where do you want me
to hang this up?
No, no.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.146
No, no, no, no, no.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.581
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
It's nothing.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.682
What's that?
It's nothing.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.084
Everybody in the article
got a plaque. It's...

08:04.117 --> 08:05.252
Okay, can I see that,
please?
Yeah.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.587
Thank you. Oh!

08:06.620 --> 08:08.121
Wait a minute.
"Vanessa Cellucci.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.358
Founder and C.E.O.,
Monkey Fist Security.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.593
'Forty under Forty.'"

08:12.626 --> 08:14.161
I don't see my name on here.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.831
I guess that's all right,
'cause it's a plaque of lies!

08:17.865 --> 08:19.466
Come on.
You're just jealous now.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.401
J
Are you kidd--

08:21.434 --> 08:22.770
Let me set something
straight here.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.304
Do you have any idea
how many plaques

08:24.337 --> 08:25.706
I turn down
on a daily basis?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.174
Uh, probably none?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.209
Wha-- No. No. No.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.678
A lot, right?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.179
A lot. Yeah, yeah.
Really?

08:32.212 --> 08:33.313
But you know what I do?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.048
I turn them down
because I'm a team player.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.383
Mm.
That's -- Yeah.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.552
But now that I know that
we're lone wolves in this thing,

08:38.586 --> 08:40.353
maybe I'll reconsider
my policy.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.622
Okay.
Change it up, right?

08:42.489 --> 08:43.624
Fine with me.
Start taking 'em.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.694
Plaque it up, buddy.
I -- Oh, I will.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.795
I will. I will.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.163
Good. I don't care.
I really don't.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.464
All right.
Who cares about this?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.300
It's not even
a caring-about thing.
Okay.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.403
Hey, Rootger.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.673
When I say stuff like
"I get plaques offered daily,"

08:59.707 --> 09:01.709
gonna need you
to back me up, okay?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.078
Then we need
some sort of signal, guy.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.047
'Cause I never know
what's going on.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.217
**

09:10.250 --> 09:13.253
So, Tracy, do you know
what you'd like to eat?

09:13.286 --> 09:16.456
Yeah.
How 'bout some tequila shots?

09:16.489 --> 09:19.693
Get this party started.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.928
Wow.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.763
Chale told me you were
a bit of a wild child.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.797
Well, I'm on holiday.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.799
Just wanna get
a little crazy.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.467
I guess
I'm with the wrong guy.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.537
I can get a little cray cray.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.707
Yeah, just last week
at Karaoke, I sang a duet.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.743
By myself.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.010
Do you want to take a minute

09:37.044 --> 09:39.546
and think about
what you just said?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.481
I do not.
Oh, I get it.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.417
They stuck me with you
because you're a wet blanket.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.253
I am a firefighter.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.255
Sometimes the only thing
between life and death

09:48.288 --> 09:49.522
is a wet blanket.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.592
I know your type.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.627
Creature of habit,

09:53.661 --> 09:56.496
going day to day
without really living.

09:56.529 --> 10:01.835
But deep inside,
there's a young, fearless...

10:01.869 --> 10:04.004
What's your name again?
Kyle.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.839
A young, fearless Kyle,

10:05.873 --> 10:08.475
wishing he'd taken
more risks in life.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.543
Wow, you're good.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.980
**

10:13.013 --> 10:14.247
No, no, no.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.983
I, uh --
I understand, Father Philip.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.251
You don't give out plaques
for attending Mass.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.653
Yep.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.054
I-I respect that.
I do.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.422
It's just that --
You know what it is?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.957
I've been really consistent
lately, and I -- Yep.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.359
No, I got it. Yeah.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.494
Yeah, it does go
against humility.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.262
Yes.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.464
Okay, see you Sunday.
Bye.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.632
He said no.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.467
All right, you know what?

10:34.501 --> 10:37.637
I'm a Viking, and --
and Vikings don't give up.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.506
Right? They throw on
their furry boots,

10:39.539 --> 10:41.541
they strap on
their helmet with the horns

10:41.574 --> 10:42.810
and the -- the metal piece
that comes out

10:42.843 --> 10:45.512
and blocks the nose
right there, and they fight.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.547
I'm getting myself
a plaque.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.416
I'll go with you.
I love it.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.219
Uh...I have to forward the
calls to my cellphone, though.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.054
What was it again?
What it star

10:54.087 --> 10:57.157
Uh, star-seven --
I'll see you in the car.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.927
I'm sorry.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.261
Uh, the lady up there

11:01.294 --> 11:04.531
said that this is the
Long Island Viking Society?

11:04.564 --> 11:05.833
Yeah, yeah.
We used to have an office,

11:05.866 --> 11:07.267
but it's super expensive,

11:07.300 --> 11:10.670
so my mom was cool enough
to let us do it down here.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.573
Uh, well, I'm Kevin.
This is Rootger.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.143
Hey.
I'm Ragnar the Wise.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.577
That's Jim the Red.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.680
We got Medieval Mike,
and that there is Kimmy.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.984
Hey, everybody.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.152
Viking power.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.553
I don't know.
Should I do, like, a sign?

11:26.586 --> 11:27.855
Do you guys do, like,
something like that, or --

11:27.888 --> 11:28.856
Oh, like a "V." Yeah!
Yeah.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.791
We should do that.
Yeah.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.125
Yeah.
Wow.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.460
Look at
that Nordic dome.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.262
That's a Viking
if ever I've seen one.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.997
Actually, I'm Dutch.

11:37.030 --> 11:37.998
He's the Viking.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.400
Oh. Okay.
Yeah.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.571
Well, uh,
I hate to be that guy,

11:44.604 --> 11:45.873
but I'm gonna need
to see some proof.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.640
Oh! Yeah, no.
Way ahead of you.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.977
Uh, here you go.
Right there.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.645
Wow. 16%?

11:52.679 --> 11:54.547
I'm only 14%.
Oh, no, no, no.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.516
That's actually
my daughter's test.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.018
I'm -- I'm 32%, so...

11:58.051 --> 12:01.688
Shut. Up.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.757
So, anyway, what do you guys
do at these meetings?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.893
You're looking at it.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.728
Don't you do, like,
Viking stuff,

12:08.762 --> 12:10.597
like, uh -- I don't know --
give out awards

12:10.630 --> 12:11.664
or -- or plaques
or anything?

12:11.698 --> 12:13.500
Sometimes we go to Chili's.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.003
Let me ask you this.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.838
You ever think about
giving out awards or plaques

12:17.871 --> 12:20.640
or anything like that?
No, not really.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.943
Okay, you know, I'm just gonna
stop beating around the bush,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.012
and I think you guys
should give me a plaque.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.514
What for?
Well, I don't know.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.649
I mean, I came up with this
pretty much, right?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.651
And then, um, I'm 32%.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.553
I'm kind of your leader,
in a way.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.555
Uh...
Good stuff. Good stuff.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.457
Right?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.259
Well, uh, we don't have
any plaques,

12:39.292 --> 12:42.495
but I might have a scroll of
valor laying around somewhere.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.997
S

12:44.031 --> 12:45.132
Mm-hmm.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.633
Get it.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.435
**

12:49.702 --> 12:51.571
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.540
What's going on?

12:53.573 --> 12:54.942
Mm, nothing.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.576
Just hanging around.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
Right?

12:58.411 --> 12:59.579
Okay.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.481
Obviously you two morons

13:01.514 --> 13:04.217
want to talk about that stupid
thing hanging on the wall.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.219
What is it?
Oh, this?

13:06.253 --> 13:09.422
Nothing. Just, uh,
my Scandinavian brethren

13:09.456 --> 13:11.258
just bestowed upon me

13:11.291 --> 13:13.493
the highest honor
for personal achievement,

13:13.526 --> 13:15.795
but whatevs.

13:15.829 --> 13:19.266
Okay, why do you have to make
everything a competition?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.433
Me?!
Yeah.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.701
You're the one
who started this, all right?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.603
By doing that article
behind my back.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.207
Okay. Again, I should've
told you about it.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.541
I am sorry.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.244
From now on, we do
everything together as a team.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.745
Okay, yeah.
All right.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.514
Thank you.
You're welcome.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.249
Right after the ceremony,
we start fresh.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.719
Ceremony?
Yeah.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.554
There's a "Forty under Forty"
awards dinner,

13:41.588 --> 13:42.522
and they asked me
to make a speech

13:42.555 --> 13:44.257
after one of the honorees
was disqualified

13:44.291 --> 13:47.394
'cause she wasn't really under
40, so it's just -- just...

13:49.496 --> 13:50.663
You're not really
under 40.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.899
Okay.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.600
Totally different.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.436
The girl was stupid enough to
post her birthday on Facebook.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.572
Grandma deserved
what she got.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.540
So, you're just gonna
get up there

14:00.573 --> 14:02.309
and take the credit
for everything, right?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.944
And you don't care
that I have something to say.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.578
'Cause I have a lot
of stories to tell.
Do you?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.813
Heroic ones about me.
Yeah. I --

14:06.846 --> 14:09.216
"Heroic" stuff?
Oh, yeah. Very heroic.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.517
Okay. Like?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.920
Okay, how 'bout the time we
were locked in a meat locker?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.287
You remember that?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.723
And -- Yeah, and I got us out
with a broom handle

14:16.756 --> 14:18.358
and -- and --
and a stick of gum.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.627
Okay.
You used the broom handle

14:20.660 --> 14:23.463
to break the glass
while you were chewing gum.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.299
Got us out, didn't I?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.301
I'm doing this
for the team, okay?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.537
There's -- There's gonna be
300 people there.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.571
We all win.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.540
Please,
stop being a baby now.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.742
300, huh?
Yes.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.345
Yeah, that's a --

14:38.378 --> 14:43.250
That's a lot of eyeballs
looking down on someone who's...

14:43.283 --> 14:45.285
not really under 40.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.687
A lot of hot lights
and everything.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.290
I'm just saying,
that's a lotta lotta.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.093
You know?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.928
Okay. I know
what you're trying to do.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.596
I'm not trying
to do anything.
Not gonna work.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.498
You know what?
I'm serious.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.967
I'm -- I'm sure you're
gonna be fine. I just --

15:00.000 --> 15:01.101
I'm gonna be great.
Okay.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.202
Thanks so much.
Yeah, all right.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.237
Not worried about it, bud.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.876
**

15:16.016 --> 15:17.250
Oh. Whoa!

15:17.284 --> 15:19.286
Ooh.
Yeah, how's it look?

15:19.319 --> 15:23.256
Am I, uh, a little too, uh,
male model

15:23.290 --> 15:24.624
Hmm...

15:24.657 --> 15:26.193
No, I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.360
But you look good.
Yeah.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.162
Oh! And you're finally
wearing the shirt

15:29.196 --> 15:30.597
that I got you
for Father's Day!

15:30.630 --> 15:31.631
Yeah, don't read into it.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.934
The only shirt in my closet
with buttons.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.003
Where are you going?
Ah.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.704
Vanessa's winning
a stupid award,

15:37.737 --> 15:39.306
so I gotta go
to some stupid hotel

15:39.339 --> 15:41.975
and listen to her give
some stupid speech.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.678
A better friend
there never was.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.214
What's the award?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.649
Ah, Long Island
business owners under 40.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.051
Under 40 what?

15:51.084 --> 15:53.086
Exactly.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.354
**

15:54.387 --> 15:55.755
Where is Vanessa?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.690
She was supposed to be here
a half-hour ago.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.994
I have to say, coming here
to support Vanessa like this?

16:01.028 --> 16:04.231
Classy stuff.
It's something new
I'm working on.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.499
You know -- putting
the needs of others before me.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.001
Nice.
Did you get four shrimp?

16:08.035 --> 16:10.270
'Cause I only got three.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.171
I don't know.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.806
But don't you?
I mean, I think you'd...

16:13.840 --> 16:15.642
You'd know how many shrimp
you had, right?

16:15.675 --> 16:17.744
Oh.
I think Vanessa's up next.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.247
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Monkey Fist Security,

16:20.280 --> 16:21.281
Vanessa Cellucci.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.218
I didn't even get
a chance to talk to her.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.587
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for what I did.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.256
I'll just do it tomorrow.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.957
We'll talk
face-to-fa-a-ce.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.895
"Forty under Forty!"

16:37.197 --> 16:38.698
We made it!

16:40.700 --> 16:43.103
Whoo!

16:43.136 --> 16:46.206
**

16:46.239 --> 16:48.541
Guys, you gotta save me.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.077
That chick
is more than a handful.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.180
I'm talking about three
straight days of crazy here.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.049
She made me drive through
the Holland Tunnel blindfolded.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.517
They have cameras.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.053
Any idea what
that ticket's gonna be like?

17:00.087 --> 17:01.288
I told you
this would happen.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.223
She does this to men.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.891
Yeah, yeah. I-I can't
hang out with her anymore.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.760
I have a job, a pension,
model train set.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.296
I just ordered
new mountains.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.498
I wanna be alive
when they arrive.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.235
Oh, that's her!

17:19.672 --> 17:22.142
-Hi.
-Hi, guys.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.543
Oh, Aunt Tracy.
How are you?

17:23.576 --> 17:24.544
Where's Kyle?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.246
He's -- Oh, not here.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.381
His Subaru
is parked out front.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.183
Okay, look, Aunt Tracy.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.852
The truth is,
Uncle Kyle really likes you,

17:32.885 --> 17:34.221
and he thinks
you're a lot of fun.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.090
I just think you might be
a little too much for him.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.958
Oh.
That's too bad.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.129
He was such a sport,
doing all the things I wanted.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.332
I thought I'd surprise him
with two V.I.P. tickets

17:45.365 --> 17:48.101
to the model train show
at the Javits Center.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.169
Oh, well.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.670
I'm back in.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.071
Forget what I said.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.341
Those tickets
are impossible to get.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.143
We're going to make
a quick pit stop.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.510
Great. Where?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.212
Atlantic City.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.183
**

18:03.216 --> 18:07.187
You may be wondering
how I got here.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.188
Do you think
there's any way

18:08.221 --> 18:09.956
they can turn down
the lights a little?

18:09.989 --> 18:11.358
Just focus on her ear.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.361
It's the only part
that still seems human.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.963
Uh, luck and persever--

18:16.996 --> 18:19.499
pers-- persev...

18:19.532 --> 18:22.202
persever-- perseverance.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.506
One second.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.210
Mm!

18:34.714 --> 18:36.416
All right, I can't.
I can't do this.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.950
I have to be honest
with all of you.

18:37.984 --> 18:41.053
What -- What Vanessa's
not being honest about

18:41.087 --> 18:44.257
is the fact that she went
undercover this afternoon

18:44.291 --> 18:45.558
at the Long Beach Aquarium,

18:45.592 --> 18:50.697
and a jellyfish just
attached itself to her face.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.401
And I'm guessing laid
quite a bit of eggs.
Okay.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.102
Uh, but...

18:56.135 --> 18:58.671
but she still wanted
to power through

18:58.705 --> 19:01.508
and be here for you tonight,
and she did.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.709
And I got to say,
that's a --

19:02.742 --> 19:05.077
That's a true mark
of bravery right there.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.247
Let's hear it
for Vanessa Cellucci.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.249
Vanessa Cellucci, huh?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.383
Yeah.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.121
Yeah.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.789
You know,
speaking of bravery...

19:16.823 --> 19:17.890
No, no, no.
Yeah, don't...

19:17.924 --> 19:19.592
No, no.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.661
Let me tell you about
a story of one man's quest

19:21.694 --> 19:23.129
to get himself out
of a meat locker

19:23.162 --> 19:25.265
with nothing
but a piece of gum

19:25.298 --> 19:27.133
and a broomstick handle.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.868
**

19:32.705 --> 19:36.409
**

19:39.379 --> 19:41.981
Hey. Pretty nice night
after all, huh?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.416
Oh, okay.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.917
Your...story --

19:44.951 --> 19:45.952
Your st-- Okay.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.387
Your story...
I'm -- Ye-- Oh.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.389
Your -- You don't get --
I'm -- I'm not
getting any of it.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.390
You're not? Okay.
Yeah.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.992
Okay. Oh. Oh.
Mm.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.429
Man: Your story went on
and on. And on. And on.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.464
Oh, really?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.965
Well, it seemed like
the whole crowd enjoyed it.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.401
Oh, please.
So boring.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.636
Z-Z-Z-Z-Z.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.472
All right.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.974
I don't need
any of this crap.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.442
I'll just go
in the other room.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.543
Fine.
Fine.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.711
Fine.
Fine!

20:11.744 --> 20:13.012
Fine.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.486
Kevin.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.422
Kevin.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.191
Kevin. Kevin.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.593
Kevin. Kevin.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.429
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin.
What?!

20:29.462 --> 20:31.764
Thank you.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.667
Look.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.769
You don't have to thank me,
all right?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.871
And by the way,
I got to tell you,

20:38.905 --> 20:40.540
you don't need
any of this stuff.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
You look fine without it.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.911
Really?
Yes, really.

20:44.944 --> 20:49.316
I'm trying so hard to smile,
but I don't think I can.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.520
Oh, let's just get
back to work, then.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.723
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:56.756 --> 21:00.393
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:00.427 --> 21:02.629
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:02.662 --> 21:04.063
* Do, do, do, do

21:04.096 --> 21:07.634
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:07.667 --> 21:10.703
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:10.737 --> 21:13.573
* I just don't want no...
