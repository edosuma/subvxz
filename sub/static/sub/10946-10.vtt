00:00.300 --> 00:01.634
Amy: Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.669 --> 00:03.370
I've been feeding these horses for years

00:03.404 --> 00:05.405
and never got that close to 'em.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.006
Well, that's Amy for you.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.674
You-you've got no legal right

00:08.708 --> 00:09.942
to stop me from seeing my niece!

00:09.977 --> 00:11.432
But it is our house,

00:11.452 --> 00:13.746
and we do have the legal right to
tell you to get the hell outta here.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.314
I'm pushing for that cull to happen,

00:15.349 --> 00:18.313
and when it does, those damn horses
are gonna be the first to go.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.519
- Okay, let's get 'em outta here.
- What the hell are you doing?!

00:20.553 --> 00:21.954
I told you not to fight me on this!

00:23.423 --> 00:25.123
Keep 'em moving!

00:25.157 --> 00:26.612
I'm with the child protection society.

00:26.632 --> 00:29.862
There's been a complaint about
Georgie's living conditions and welfare.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.229
Can you believe what we just did?

00:31.264 --> 00:33.932
That was completely awesome.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.470
Ty Borden, Amy Flemming,

00:38.505 --> 00:40.816
you're under arrest for horse theft.

00:42.782 --> 00:45.510
- Horse theft?
- You heard the officer.

00:45.544 --> 00:46.878
How can you arrest us for horse theft?

00:46.913 --> 00:48.320
You should arrest this guy.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.259
He's the one who stole
the herd off Will Vernon.

00:50.279 --> 00:52.183
They're wild horses!
They don't belong to will or anybody else.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.418
I'm completely within my rights.

00:53.452 --> 00:55.153
Yeah, but you trespassed on Will's land

00:55.187 --> 00:56.754
to get them in the first place.

00:56.789 --> 00:58.956
Mr. Pincher has a government permit.

00:58.990 --> 01:01.258
He's allowed by law to capture
any wild horses in this area.

01:01.293 --> 01:03.160
I'm gonna give you a choice.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.328
Return the horses to his corral

01:05.363 --> 01:08.499
or I will have to put you under arrest.

01:16.616 --> 01:18.375
I can't believe this.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.277
It's a notice of investigation from the...

01:20.312 --> 01:22.346
- child protection society. They're...
- Shhh!

01:22.380 --> 01:23.987
They're setting up an
appointment with us for tomorrow.

01:24.007 --> 01:24.696
Oh my God.

01:24.716 --> 01:26.583
There's a
litany of complaints here, Lou. Look!

01:26.617 --> 01:28.785
"Child works on the farm for three hours

01:28.820 --> 01:32.255
both before and after school.
Could constitute child labour.

01:32.289 --> 01:34.157
An alleged... An alleged accident occurred

01:34.191 --> 01:36.326
while the child was unsupervised.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.929
This could be deemed as possible
child abuse and neglect."

01:38.963 --> 01:41.130
Peter, this is all lies.

01:41.165 --> 01:45.268
Every bit of it has
been skewed and twisted.

01:45.302 --> 01:47.603
It's Crystal.
She's the one who's done this.

01:47.637 --> 01:50.173
It has to be her.

01:51.675 --> 01:53.309
Hi-yah!

01:57.481 --> 01:59.648
Come on! Yah! Hi-yah!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.359 --> 02:12.330
- That's it, that's all of 'em.
- Close the gate.

02:16.366 --> 02:18.369
All right, you two,
you're finished here.

02:19.027 --> 02:20.935
It doesn't have to be like this, Matt.

02:20.970 --> 02:23.105
But you don't get to decide that.

02:23.139 --> 02:25.673
I don't want you near those horses again.

02:25.708 --> 02:28.463
Same goes for Will Vernon.
You tell him that.

02:30.448 --> 02:32.680
Let's go.

02:43.052 --> 02:46.661
We can't let this happen, Ty.
All those beautiful horses.

02:46.695 --> 02:48.596
He's gonna send them to auction.
He's gonna let them die.

02:48.631 --> 02:50.665
Okay. don't worry about it, all right?

02:50.699 --> 02:54.468
We'll figure this out,
just one step at a time.

02:56.938 --> 02:58.439
Amy, look.

03:02.744 --> 03:05.046
At least he's still free.

03:08.282 --> 03:10.851
This isn't over yet. It's just beginning.

They don't release that information.

I bet I know who.

04:01.410 --> 04:02.701
Hey!

04:05.706 --> 04:07.272
It was aunt Crystal.

04:07.307 --> 04:10.682
She's the only person who
would know about this stuff.

04:11.744 --> 04:13.912
Georgie, listen...

04:18.483 --> 04:21.152
Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.

04:21.185 --> 04:22.687
We thought it might be a good idea

04:22.722 --> 04:24.856
since emotions are running a little high

04:24.890 --> 04:26.791
to get together and talk about
what's happening with the horses.

04:26.826 --> 04:28.093
So, Matt, you're up.

04:28.127 --> 04:30.794
Thanks, Joanna.

04:30.829 --> 04:34.565
Okay!
I'm sorry about the situation this morning.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.895
Nothing would've happened if certain people
hadn't interfered in the first place.

04:38.915 --> 04:41.936
Look, guys,
I'm taking good care of the herd.

04:41.956 --> 04:45.095
They're being watered and fed in
line with the rules of the capture.

04:45.115 --> 04:47.197
They're probably better off than they
were when they were wandering in the wild.

04:47.217 --> 04:48.578
Out of curiosity,

04:48.613 --> 04:50.614
how'd you come up with the
number you could take in?

04:50.649 --> 04:53.450
I've got the statistics right here.

04:53.484 --> 04:56.486
Now,
they did an aerial study and it shows...

04:56.521 --> 04:58.421
The herd population in this area alone

04:58.456 --> 05:00.908
grew by 20 percent in the last two years.

05:00.928 --> 05:03.926
Now, the horses that I captured represent
a tiny portion of that 20 percent.

05:03.961 --> 05:05.228
When did you do this count?

05:05.263 --> 05:08.131
Last October.

05:08.518 --> 05:10.167
- Before the flood.
- Yeah.

05:10.201 --> 05:13.002
And before the worst winter
in my personal memory.

05:13.037 --> 05:15.472
- That's right.
- Now it's just my humble opinion,

05:15.506 --> 05:18.074
but I figure there's a
natural cull going on here.

05:18.108 --> 05:19.876
She's called mother nature.

05:24.247 --> 05:27.249
You know, your old man,
he loved them horses.

05:27.284 --> 05:29.919
He absolutely loved them and you know that.

05:29.953 --> 05:32.254
What is wrong with you?

05:32.289 --> 05:35.124
Right now he's flipped
around in that grave of his.

05:35.159 --> 05:38.827
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, boy.

05:42.199 --> 05:44.866
Matt, I think something
that we can actually agree on

05:44.901 --> 05:47.670
is that we need to keep
these horses healthy.

05:47.704 --> 05:50.539
Because it's part of your
deal as a permit holder.

05:50.574 --> 05:52.608
- Correct.
- So it is in your best interest

05:52.642 --> 05:54.695
to make sure the horses are in good shape.

05:54.715 --> 05:55.998
What're you saying?

05:56.018 --> 05:59.081
I'm just saying that maybe Ty,
with his vet experience,

05:59.115 --> 06:01.049
should monitor the horses' condition

06:01.084 --> 06:03.418
while they're in your care, and I can help.

06:03.452 --> 06:05.754
No. They don't need to be monitored.
They're fine.

06:05.788 --> 06:08.123
You don't know that. They're wild, right?

06:08.157 --> 06:09.990
So they could have any number of diseases.

06:10.025 --> 06:12.927
Diseases that could spread to other stock.
To healthy stock.

06:12.961 --> 06:14.562
Come on, Matt. What're you afraid of?

06:14.597 --> 06:18.633
- Yeah!
- Let 'em check out the horses.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.302
Fine. Monitor the horses.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.138
But that's it, you hear me?

06:24.172 --> 06:26.707
She said she loved me,
Jeffie, and...

06:26.742 --> 06:28.508
she said I was just like my mom

06:28.543 --> 06:32.113
and she gave me all these
pictures and stuff and...

06:33.057 --> 06:34.615
Okay.

06:35.054 --> 06:38.986
Well, can I call you once you're done work?

06:39.020 --> 06:41.421
Okay. I'll let you know what it happens.

06:41.456 --> 06:44.991
Okay. Love you too. Bye.

06:45.816 --> 06:47.628
Georgie?

07:02.777 --> 07:04.656
What's gonna happen
at the appointment tomorrow?

07:04.676 --> 07:06.046
It'll be fine.

07:06.066 --> 07:07.847
I called Clint and I left a message.

07:07.882 --> 07:10.650
He knows us and he loves you.

07:10.684 --> 07:14.087
Just be totally honest and
nothing bad can happen.

07:14.121 --> 07:18.056
That hasn't always worked, even with Clint.

07:18.091 --> 07:21.026
Look. I know that you were disappointed

07:21.060 --> 07:23.696
when we asked your aunt Crystal to leave.

07:23.730 --> 07:25.893
And I know that you wish things
could've turned out differently.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.801
No. I don't. Not anymore.

07:28.835 --> 07:33.005
And I-I was just on the phone with Jeffie
and he remembers Crystal.

07:33.039 --> 07:36.942
My mom... She didn't trust her and...

07:36.976 --> 07:39.526
she said she was a bad influence on us.

07:40.072 --> 07:42.514
Come here.

07:42.939 --> 07:45.684
Everything's gonna be all right, okay?

07:50.022 --> 07:52.454
Amy, honey,
I thought you did a great job

07:52.474 --> 07:53.558
at that meeting today.

07:53.578 --> 07:55.126
Well, at least it was a step.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.296
Now that I can get close to Matt's horses,
I can start to gentle them.

07:58.331 --> 08:00.097
Yeah?
And how do you plan on doing that?

08:00.132 --> 08:01.966
Hopefully, right under Matt's nose,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.335
and then I'll find homes for them.

08:03.369 --> 08:04.989
Great.

08:09.866 --> 08:11.318
Hey.

08:17.823 --> 08:20.651
It's really beautiful out there, Amy.

08:21.310 --> 08:23.164
You wanna go for a walk?

08:23.184 --> 08:24.703
You should, you should.

08:24.723 --> 08:28.465
I'll-I'll put wood on the fire
and keep it going till you get back.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.026
Okay. Sure.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.073
Thanks.

08:38.068 --> 08:41.436
See that?
What do you got to say now, huh?

08:44.591 --> 08:48.659
I'm just glad everyone's
away during all of this.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.529
- What if she wins?
- She won't.

08:54.549 --> 08:58.119
What if... You saw that report.

08:58.154 --> 08:59.488
It's claiming you're an absentee parent.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.542
I know, I know.

09:01.562 --> 09:05.153
It's gonna make it worse if you and I...

09:05.173 --> 09:07.399
If we don't figure things out.

09:07.419 --> 09:10.599
Yeah, uh... I think, just for now,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.267
we have to put our personal issues aside

09:12.301 --> 09:15.069
and just create a united front.

09:15.104 --> 09:18.707
You know, for Georgie's sake.

09:18.741 --> 09:21.276
Just for Georgie's sake?

09:21.310 --> 09:25.146
No... for us, too.

09:29.751 --> 09:33.221
Kind of a weird day.

09:33.255 --> 09:35.390
I guess it's
becoming a habit for you,

09:35.424 --> 09:37.558
this getting arrested thing.

09:39.295 --> 09:42.563
Come on...

09:42.597 --> 09:45.265
I wasn't arrested after that bar episode.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.902
You and Caleb were such a mess.

09:50.472 --> 09:55.368
Ty... why didn't you call?

09:56.088 --> 09:59.413
You know, after...
I picked you up and everything?

09:59.798 --> 10:02.615
I wanted to,

10:02.650 --> 10:04.217
but I decided to give you some time

10:04.252 --> 10:05.986
to figure out what it is that you want.

10:08.425 --> 10:11.067
What I wanted was to talk,

10:11.427 --> 10:14.727
but...
you made it pretty clear that you didn't.

10:14.762 --> 10:16.596
You kept giving me the cold shoulder,

10:16.630 --> 10:19.833
and then, this morning,
you do a complete 180.

10:20.275 --> 10:23.043
You kissed me, Ty.

10:23.604 --> 10:26.739
Did that... Did that mean something

10:26.774 --> 10:29.642
or was that just us getting
caught up in the moment?

10:29.677 --> 10:31.177
I'm not giving you the cold shoulder,

10:31.211 --> 10:34.180
I just don't want us to go
right back to where we were.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.983
Then... what do you want me to do?

10:37.017 --> 10:39.226
Amy, I want you to figure
out what's important to you.

10:39.246 --> 10:40.987
I have.

10:41.021 --> 10:44.357
Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have.

10:44.755 --> 10:47.436
So what do you want?

10:48.218 --> 10:51.663
You're gonna have to tell
me what's important to you.

10:57.154 --> 10:59.337
Say something.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.387
Just sit down. They'll be fine.

11:15.421 --> 11:17.622
Yeah, I know. I know.

11:17.656 --> 11:19.624
And who do we have to thank for that?

11:22.128 --> 11:24.161
Hey, honey.

11:24.195 --> 11:27.398
Good night.

11:27.432 --> 11:30.100
Yeah, tell me again.
Who do we have to thank?

11:36.688 --> 11:38.856
Yeah, Mel. I-no, no, no!

11:38.876 --> 11:42.128
These are true "hot shot" type horses.
No, you have to see them.

11:42.162 --> 11:44.284
Yeah, I got a client roster
in my phone from last month.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.178
Is that still up-to-date?

11:46.327 --> 11:48.667
Okay, good.
Thanks for spreading the word, Scott.

11:48.702 --> 11:50.502
Just, just, just come up. That's it.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.103
If you see them,
I guarantee you'll buy a few of them.

11:52.138 --> 11:53.439
Okay. I've been through all my clients

11:53.473 --> 11:56.208
and there's lots of prospects.

11:56.242 --> 12:00.178
There's something about a group of
tree hugging horsey people on a mission.

12:00.213 --> 12:02.012
But have you even thought
about what's gonna happen

12:02.032 --> 12:03.481
when all these people start showing up?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.550
Matt's gonna know.
I mean, they have to deal with him.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.185
Well,
I've got time to talk Matt around.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.297
Actually,
you don't have any time at all.

12:09.317 --> 12:12.593
I just heard.
Meat truck's coming... tomorrow.

12:22.389 --> 12:24.467
Hi there.

12:24.487 --> 12:26.105
Um, nice to see you again.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.286
Will-will Clint be joining us today?

12:28.306 --> 12:30.074
Actually, my boss is on vacation,

12:30.108 --> 12:33.110
so all twelve of your
emails were forwarded to me.

12:33.144 --> 12:37.066
Judging by the content of some of them,
I'm sure you weren't aware.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.554
So how would you like to
go about these interviews?

12:43.588 --> 12:47.581
Well, protocol states that
I should start with you and Peter.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.426
Of course.

12:50.108 --> 12:51.589
Um, separately.

12:51.609 --> 12:52.929
Oh. Okay.

12:52.964 --> 12:56.287
Um, who would you like to...
interrogate first?

12:56.307 --> 12:57.696
You.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.705
And Mrs. Morris,
this is not an interrogation.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.932
This is for the good of your child.

13:27.797 --> 13:29.431
It's okay.

13:37.036 --> 13:38.885
There you go.

13:42.794 --> 13:44.412
That doesn't hurt, now, does it?

13:46.849 --> 13:50.352
You don't think I'd
hear about what you're up to?

13:51.382 --> 13:52.920
It's a small town!

13:52.955 --> 13:55.196
You're just supposed to make
sure these horses are healthy.

13:55.216 --> 13:56.845
Not break them.

13:56.865 --> 13:57.892
Matt, please listen to me.

13:57.926 --> 14:00.394
No! No,
I should've known you'd go behind my back.

14:00.428 --> 14:03.297
Okay, but I have a long list of people

14:03.331 --> 14:05.499
seriously considering adopting them.

14:05.534 --> 14:08.335
- I ain't interested!
- Why not?

14:08.370 --> 14:10.504
Because, quite frankly, I can save
time and money sending them to auction.

14:10.539 --> 14:13.041
Matt, please, I don't believe you!

14:13.075 --> 14:16.710
Look, these horses,
they could have great homes.

14:16.744 --> 14:18.612
There are people willing to pay for them.

14:18.647 --> 14:20.314
The end result is the same.

14:20.348 --> 14:23.484
There's still money in your pocket.

14:23.518 --> 14:27.854
Okay, here's the deal.
I'm a reasonable man.

14:27.889 --> 14:31.391
- Okay...
- Do whatever you want with them...

14:31.425 --> 14:34.895
But... tomorrow morning,
they go to the highest bidder,

14:34.929 --> 14:38.932
be it the glue factory or
someone who wants to adopt.

14:38.966 --> 14:42.803
So... go ahead and rally your troops,

14:42.837 --> 14:45.886
but I'll be the one
making the final decision.

14:47.872 --> 14:50.643
All right.

15:07.237 --> 15:09.376
I understand your
husband works in Vancouver.

15:09.396 --> 15:11.597
- Um, how often is he home?
- He travels for work,

15:11.631 --> 15:13.938
but that doesn't put a
strain on the relationship.

15:13.958 --> 15:15.601
A strain? Why do you use that word?

15:15.635 --> 15:19.401
No, no.
I said there isn't... a strain.

15:23.109 --> 15:26.578
Moving on.
Um, let's discuss Georgie's recent injury.

15:26.613 --> 15:28.633
Can you take me through
how that actually happened?

15:28.653 --> 15:32.016
Georgie takes trick riding lessons
and she was practicing in our ring.

15:32.051 --> 15:34.052
You know,
I'm surprised someone as young as Georgie's

15:34.086 --> 15:36.721
- doing such a dangerous sport.
- It's not dangerous.

15:36.756 --> 15:38.723
Hanging upside down from a
galloping horse isn't dangerous?

15:38.758 --> 15:40.759
I know,
but a lot of girls Georgie's age do it,

15:40.793 --> 15:44.162
and the lessons are
always highly supervised.

15:44.196 --> 15:47.132
Mm. But to my understanding,
it wasn't highly supervised

15:47.166 --> 15:49.768
the day Georgie broke her arm,
was it, Mrs. Morris?

15:49.802 --> 15:52.003
Where were you when it happened?

15:52.037 --> 15:55.239
I was in the house with Katie,
but Georgie wasn't alone.

15:55.274 --> 15:56.707
She was with her aunt.

15:56.742 --> 15:58.576
And in fact, I discovered later

15:58.610 --> 16:01.345
that her aunt was encouraging
her and egging her on,

16:01.380 --> 16:03.847
even though Georgie knew
it was against house rules;

16:03.882 --> 16:06.384
that Peter and I would
never have condoned it.

16:06.418 --> 16:09.486
That may be, but the bottom line is...

16:09.520 --> 16:11.021
You weren't there to supervise her,
were you?

16:11.055 --> 16:14.158
Well, I...

16:14.976 --> 16:16.193
No. You weren't.

16:16.227 --> 16:18.965
If her aunt hadn't challenged
Georgie in the first place...

16:18.985 --> 16:21.932
Mrs. Morris... Lou,

16:21.966 --> 16:25.102
this interview is standard protocol.

16:25.136 --> 16:27.771
It's necessary for me to understand
why these complaints were made.

16:27.805 --> 16:29.906
I think we both know where
these complaints have come from.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.974
So why can't we just be upfront about it?

16:32.009 --> 16:34.377
That's against policy.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.414
Yeah, that's right. I uh...

16:37.448 --> 16:38.948
I commute back and forth to Vancouver.

16:38.982 --> 16:40.684
Did you know that while you're gone,

16:40.718 --> 16:42.952
Georgie is routinely up at dawn,
doing chores in the barn

16:42.986 --> 16:45.054
that some would consider hard labour?

16:45.088 --> 16:47.156
I'm sorry, hard labour?

16:47.191 --> 16:51.260
Some foster children are adopted
for reasons other than their well-being.

16:51.295 --> 16:55.631
They're thought of sometimes
as unpaid household help.

16:55.665 --> 16:58.034
Okay. Do you wanna tell
me where you're going with this?

16:58.068 --> 17:00.101
That isn't the case here,
is it, Mr. Morris?

17:00.136 --> 17:01.970
Or were you even aware it was going on?

17:02.004 --> 17:03.806
Uh, we live on a ranch,
so Georgie does chores.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.508
In fact, we all do chores.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.844
She happens to love being out with the
horses before school in the morning.

17:08.877 --> 17:10.979
It's part of her routine and we
couldn't stop her if we tried.

17:11.012 --> 17:14.690
So I would hardly call it hard labour.
That's insulting.

17:14.710 --> 17:17.487
No one's accusing you of anything,
Mr. Morris.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.554
These are standard
questions for clarification.

17:19.588 --> 17:21.433
Right, well, I don't think you'd
have to ask these questions

17:21.453 --> 17:25.242
if you'd done any homework and
found out anything about us.

17:25.262 --> 17:27.717
How can you take these complaints
at face value like this?

17:27.737 --> 17:30.393
Honestly. It's ridiculous.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.421
I've done everything that's required of me.

17:36.672 --> 17:39.306
Let's get the next one ready for the shoot.

17:41.443 --> 17:43.411
Whoa! Settle down there.

17:43.445 --> 17:45.446
Whoa...

17:48.716 --> 17:51.485
- All right.
- That's it.

17:51.519 --> 17:54.423
- How many is this?
- Five more to go.

17:55.353 --> 17:57.137
Whoa... there.

17:57.807 --> 18:00.016
Thanks for keeping him calm.

18:00.575 --> 18:02.684
You know, this is what I miss the most.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.531
Us working together.

18:05.566 --> 18:07.633
It's what we always wanted, right?

18:07.668 --> 18:09.768
It was a dream.

18:13.373 --> 18:16.020
Maybe we just keep it at that.

18:24.105 --> 18:27.086
Oh no, he's back.
Matt is gonna see him!

18:27.120 --> 18:28.787
- Amy!
- Amy, be careful!

18:28.822 --> 18:30.522
Go on! Get outta here, you hear me?!

18:30.556 --> 18:31.757
Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!

18:31.791 --> 18:33.225
Go on!

18:33.259 --> 18:35.994
- Now, easy.
- Go! Just go!

18:36.029 --> 18:38.030
Come on. Come on.

18:38.064 --> 18:40.232
Please, you have to leave.

19:01.253 --> 19:03.855
You broke your arm, Georgie.

19:03.889 --> 19:05.422
Is it true you did it trick riding?

19:05.457 --> 19:08.525
Or was it broken some other way?

19:08.560 --> 19:11.362
You think I'm abused?

19:11.396 --> 19:15.399
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?

19:15.433 --> 19:19.470
Look, I know how the game goes.

19:19.504 --> 19:21.972
You people are always trying
to put words in my mouth,

19:22.006 --> 19:24.207
trying to make me say things I don't mean.

19:24.242 --> 19:27.544
Now, that's not true.

19:27.579 --> 19:30.413
I want you to feel you can tell me things.

19:30.447 --> 19:32.515
You're in a safe place...

19:32.549 --> 19:35.252
I'm not abused.
Okay, I broke my arm

19:35.286 --> 19:37.254
when I was doing a trick riding
routine for my aunt Crystal.

19:37.288 --> 19:39.256
It was my fault.

19:39.290 --> 19:40.924
I shouldn't have been
doing it with her alone.

19:40.958 --> 19:43.382
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.

19:43.402 --> 19:45.528
Was it my aunt Crystal who complained?

19:45.562 --> 19:49.365
Um, Georgie, I can't answer that.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.801
I bet it was...
because she's mad at Lou and Peter

19:51.835 --> 19:54.570
because they didn't let her
stay and get to know me.

19:54.605 --> 19:56.806
You know,
I haven't seen her since I was two,

19:56.840 --> 19:58.240
and I don't even remember her.

19:58.275 --> 20:00.410
But my brother does,

20:00.444 --> 20:03.679
and he says that she wasn't very nice,

20:03.713 --> 20:06.081
and my mom didn't like her and
she was a bad influence on us.

20:06.116 --> 20:07.449
I don't really need
to know the whole history.

20:07.483 --> 20:10.519
You do! You need to know my aunt

20:10.553 --> 20:13.467
just as much as you need to know me

20:13.487 --> 20:16.115
because she's the one who's accusing
my mom and dad of being bad parents,

20:16.135 --> 20:17.959
and it's a lie!

20:21.897 --> 20:24.599
You're supposed to be helping us.

20:24.634 --> 20:26.735
You're supposed to be helping me.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.679
- Okay, so...
- So what's the next step here?

20:38.714 --> 20:40.248
Um, I'm afraid I have
to review the case further.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.850
I'll be in touch. Please stay in town.

20:48.269 --> 20:51.470
- That's my best offer.
- Fair enough.

21:00.076 --> 21:03.411
Not as many takers as we'd hoped.

21:03.445 --> 21:05.299
Well, rumour has it that
Matt's been telling people

21:05.319 --> 21:07.248
the sale was cancelled.

21:07.283 --> 21:09.651
- Look at this one.
- No, I'm not sure about him.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.653
This is a really nice,
young colt, okay?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.988
He was easily gentled.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.123
It's gonna some time
to gain his confidence,

21:16.158 --> 21:18.492
but he's a hundred percent sound.

21:19.148 --> 21:20.600
Good boy.

21:22.563 --> 21:24.531
Now if I can do this in a day,

21:24.565 --> 21:26.800
imagine what you can do with more time.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.328
Now if anyone is interested,
please go see Matt

21:29.348 --> 21:31.204
and place your bid.

21:37.327 --> 21:39.045
Why hasn't she called?

21:39.079 --> 21:40.546
You know, and Clint...

21:40.580 --> 21:44.617
picked the worst possible
time to be on vacation.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.085
Of course, I've left more messages,

21:46.120 --> 21:48.721
but they're probably all going to Abby.

21:48.755 --> 21:52.025
Don't go over Abby's head, okay?
It's a bad idea.

21:52.059 --> 21:55.394
It's just gonna alienate her more.

22:12.145 --> 22:15.072
Georgie...

22:22.421 --> 22:24.957
I'm getting complaints!
People are furious!

22:24.991 --> 22:26.758
You're turning down everyone's offer? Why?

22:26.792 --> 22:29.293
They're too low!
I told you, they go to the highest bidder.

22:29.328 --> 22:31.663
My client offered you
twelve hundred dollars.

22:31.697 --> 22:34.262
That's way higher than any
meat buyer's gonna give you!

22:34.282 --> 22:36.401
What is wrong with you?!

22:36.435 --> 22:40.288
Will said your father loved those horses!
How can you just kill them?

22:40.512 --> 22:43.091
Those horses killed my father.

22:45.610 --> 22:48.112
I understand you're
under fire from the CPS.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.438
It must be very difficult.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.817
You should know since you're the
one who instigated the entire thing!

22:53.852 --> 22:55.920
I don't see how you can
show your face at our door.

22:55.954 --> 22:58.454
You took the truth and
you twisted it into total lies.

22:58.474 --> 23:01.392
I believe I had just cause.

23:01.426 --> 23:04.461
You tried to keep me from
seeing my only niece.

23:04.496 --> 23:07.153
I told you, you wouldn't get away with it.

23:09.299 --> 23:12.736
But... I can make this all go away.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.166
For a price.

23:15.638 --> 23:16.607
For a price?

23:16.641 --> 23:20.718
I'm sorry,
you're blackmailing us!

23:20.738 --> 23:22.012
It's hardly blackmail.

23:22.046 --> 23:24.347
If you want me out of
Georgie's life that much,

23:24.382 --> 23:28.818
then I believe I deserve
a little compensation.

23:29.950 --> 23:30.753
You have my number.

23:30.788 --> 23:32.755
Yeah,
I have your number all right, Crystal.

23:36.126 --> 23:38.428
You call me when you're
ready to discuss this.

23:39.174 --> 23:41.172
I'm in town.

23:45.268 --> 23:46.936
Well, they tried, Will.

23:46.970 --> 23:50.039
Amy and Ty, they did their best.

23:50.073 --> 23:53.842
You know what? I think I'm
just getting too old... for all this.

23:53.876 --> 23:56.178
I'm sick and tired of fighting.

23:56.872 --> 23:59.714
Actually, no.

23:59.749 --> 24:02.585
Actually,
what I'm sick and tired of is losing.

24:02.605 --> 24:06.455
Losing fights, losing them horses...

24:06.489 --> 24:09.090
There's not much left to lose anymore.

24:09.124 --> 24:11.259
- Nah, that's not true.
- Oh no?

24:11.293 --> 24:13.094
Well, what would you know about it?

24:13.128 --> 24:15.664
Look,
Sam doesn't come up here to see me no more.

24:15.698 --> 24:19.901
Now Joanna's met this guy and
she's taking off with him.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.938
Lost my best friend this last winter.

24:22.972 --> 24:25.806
On top of everything else,
my health is totally giving out.

24:25.841 --> 24:29.077
Now it's my lungs
and don't be telling Joanna.

24:29.111 --> 24:32.746
Look, you don't wanna lose anything else,
then move! Go with her.

24:32.781 --> 24:35.483
It seems pretty simple
from where I'm standing.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.353
Oh, it seems pretty simple
to Mr. High-and-mighty, does it?

24:38.387 --> 24:40.699
You're telling me to do something
you'd never do yourself.

24:40.719 --> 24:41.889
Am I right?

24:41.923 --> 24:44.157
Your wife travels, she moves around,

24:44.192 --> 24:47.761
but you're "independent."
You don't gotta go nowhere.

24:47.796 --> 24:50.664
It's a fancy way of saying
that you're gonna stay put.

24:50.699 --> 24:52.833
People wanna see you,
they gotta come where you're at.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.401
You're not gonna move anywhere.

24:54.435 --> 24:56.269
So don't be giving me advice

24:56.304 --> 24:59.072
that you wouldn't take yourself, thank you.

24:59.107 --> 25:01.008
- Come on, will...
- You know what you can help me do?

25:01.042 --> 25:03.910
You can help me convince Joanna.
That would help.

25:03.944 --> 25:06.046
She seems to think that if she
leaves me up here by myself,

25:06.080 --> 25:07.981
I'm gonna kick the bucket,

25:08.016 --> 25:10.450
when it's exactly the reverse that's true.

25:10.485 --> 25:13.653
If I have to sell up and
move down there with her,

25:13.687 --> 25:18.491
that'll kill me sure as sure.
It's a death sentence.

25:18.526 --> 25:21.828
Well, I guess you don't wanna hear
this, but that's all on you.

25:21.862 --> 25:24.263
You gotta explain things to Joanna.

25:24.297 --> 25:26.666
It just doesn't go anywhere.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.468
She gets all emotional. Well, you know...

25:29.503 --> 25:32.838
and then I get riled up and then...
it ends there.

25:32.872 --> 25:37.809
Well,
I may be wrong about some things,

25:39.497 --> 25:41.280
but there's one thing I do know.

25:41.314 --> 25:45.684
They're taking those
horses away this afternoon.

25:45.718 --> 25:50.722
I know it's just something else
that you are losing, but...

25:50.757 --> 25:53.025
It doesn't mean that
you can't go over there

25:53.059 --> 25:56.662
and say a proper goodbye.

26:08.407 --> 26:09.774
Folks, can you move back,
please, give us some room.

26:09.808 --> 26:11.842
Thanks.

26:11.877 --> 26:15.480
Matt, come on, this isn't right.

26:15.514 --> 26:17.406
Just hold on a second,
will ya, fellas?

26:17.426 --> 26:19.727
Just... give me a second here.

26:19.747 --> 26:21.953
I got something I wanna say,

26:21.987 --> 26:24.983
although I'm pretty sure Matt
here doesn't wanna hear it.

26:25.003 --> 26:26.596
Too bad.

26:26.616 --> 26:30.795
Now me and Matt's father, Malcolm Pincher,

26:30.829 --> 26:34.264
we were pretty good friends,
we were neighbours for years.

26:34.299 --> 26:36.266
And the thing that we
mainly shared was our love

26:36.301 --> 26:38.668
for these wild horses right here.

26:38.703 --> 26:41.905
As a matter of fact,

26:41.939 --> 26:45.742
this is one of Malcolm Pincher's paintings.

26:45.776 --> 26:50.013
I'm sure you seen it...
At my daughter's place.

26:50.047 --> 26:52.048
Have you seen this one, Matt?

26:52.083 --> 26:55.966
Look at it. Come on, look at it.

26:57.257 --> 27:00.153
Now, do you not see the passion in there?

27:00.173 --> 27:02.617
The passion your old
man had for these herds

27:02.637 --> 27:05.328
that have wandered through
these fields forever?

27:06.066 --> 27:08.900
These are proud and noble animals,

27:08.920 --> 27:11.730
and you know what?
They deserve to be able just to run free

27:11.750 --> 27:13.872
just as they did.

27:15.405 --> 27:18.891
They have that right because
they're part of our history,

27:19.424 --> 27:21.253
and part of our heritage too.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.946
It's a heritage I would
not wanna see disappear.

27:23.980 --> 27:28.119
What I want is for my grandson
and my great grandchildren

27:28.139 --> 27:30.837
to be able to watch these horses,

27:30.857 --> 27:34.023
as we've done, in their natural habitat.

27:34.057 --> 27:36.992
And they're natural
habitat is not a paddock.

27:37.027 --> 27:40.129
They don't deserve to live like this.

27:40.163 --> 27:43.331
They certainly don't
deserve to die like this,

27:44.454 --> 27:46.034
do they?

27:46.749 --> 27:48.870
Let's go! Load 'em up!

27:51.402 --> 27:52.879
Let's go.

27:52.899 --> 27:54.376
Hi-yah! Come on!

27:54.410 --> 27:56.444
Come on! Yip, yip!

27:56.479 --> 27:58.484
Come on, move. Come on. Yah!

27:58.504 --> 28:01.215
That's it. Yah! Yah! Come on!

28:01.249 --> 28:04.056
That's it, come on!

28:04.076 --> 28:06.154
Yip-yip-yip! Yah! Hi-yah!

28:06.188 --> 28:08.589
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

28:20.521 --> 28:22.482
That's the last one.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.638
Matt! You can't do this!

28:25.672 --> 28:27.606
I don't know what
happened with your father...

28:27.641 --> 28:28.874
- No, you don't.
- But these horses

28:28.908 --> 28:32.008
don't deserve to suffer because of it.

28:32.368 --> 28:36.103
What happened, Matt? Please tell me.

28:36.612 --> 28:40.418
He was out there at dawn
every morning last winter,

28:40.453 --> 28:43.955
and the winter before that, hauling hay,

28:43.989 --> 28:46.791
feeding those damn animals
in the bitter cold.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.926
That's what he was doing that morning,

28:48.961 --> 28:52.598
and he dropped dead. Just... gone.

28:54.199 --> 28:58.202
He uh... he had years.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.572
He was doing what he loved,

29:01.606 --> 29:04.778
and he loved those horses.

29:04.798 --> 29:09.146
Think of how he would feel
watching what's going on today.

29:42.260 --> 29:45.819
Hey... come here.

29:55.484 --> 29:58.393
It's ridiculous.
Maybe we should just pay her.

29:58.428 --> 29:59.962
No! Honey, there- there is no way!

29:59.996 --> 30:01.964
If we pay Crystal one cent,

30:01.998 --> 30:03.398
she's gonna be back again and again,

30:03.433 --> 30:06.181
and it won't stop.

30:06.201 --> 30:08.604
We have to just call Abby
and tell her what's happened.

30:08.638 --> 30:10.773
- Tell her everything.
- It's pointless.

30:10.807 --> 30:13.575
It's our word against Crystal's.

30:13.610 --> 30:17.178
Abby doesn't seem to value our
word very much anyways, does she?

30:17.213 --> 30:19.981
Maybe she doesn't have to.

30:27.089 --> 30:28.657
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

30:30.754 --> 30:32.460
I heard you were
pretty amazing this morning,

30:32.494 --> 30:33.928
in front of that crowd.

30:33.963 --> 30:36.597
Hardly.

30:36.632 --> 30:39.834
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thanks.

30:39.869 --> 30:41.803
And dad, I finally get it.

30:41.837 --> 30:44.472
Mm... you get what?

30:44.506 --> 30:46.607
The wild horses, it's...

30:46.642 --> 30:48.609
It's kind of about you, too, isn't it?

30:48.644 --> 30:50.675
Oh, here we go.

30:50.695 --> 30:54.560
I think you're kinda reading
into things here a little bit.

30:54.580 --> 30:58.152
I get it, that...
You need to be... free

30:58.186 --> 31:00.921
and living on your own
and being independent.

31:00.955 --> 31:03.023
Yeah, sure you do.

31:03.057 --> 31:06.526
I do, and I respect it.

31:10.709 --> 31:13.267
And if that's what you really want,

31:13.301 --> 31:16.336
I totally understand. I mean it.

31:16.728 --> 31:18.854
Well, thank you.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.841
But listen to me now, you know...

31:21.875 --> 31:24.778
I think that you should go.

31:24.812 --> 31:28.147
If that's what you wanna do,
you should just do it.

31:28.182 --> 31:29.549
You don't have to worry about me.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.218
I'll be just fine.

31:32.252 --> 31:34.220
- I know you will.
- Okay?

31:36.860 --> 31:39.892
But I've been thinking...
I might have been a bit hasty

31:39.927 --> 31:43.395
- putting everything up for sale.
- What?

31:43.430 --> 31:47.099
What if I held on to the hotel and bar,

31:47.134 --> 31:48.600
and maybe just kept it open
during the summer months,

31:48.635 --> 31:51.137
like a resort.

31:51.171 --> 31:52.805
And then I'd be up here
a few months of the year,

31:52.840 --> 31:54.506
and Sam too.

31:54.541 --> 31:56.107
And the other fella?

31:56.142 --> 31:58.910
Yeah, hopefully.

31:58.945 --> 32:01.913
Curtis, the other fella, he'd be here too.

32:01.948 --> 32:04.049
What do you think?

32:04.083 --> 32:06.518
I think that what you're trying to do

32:06.553 --> 32:07.953
is find someway that you
can keep an eye on me

32:07.987 --> 32:11.556
and I'm trying to tell you,
I'm gonna be okay.

32:11.590 --> 32:13.959
Yeah, but if I had a place in Okotoks,

32:13.993 --> 32:15.961
I could drag you there on
the worst days of winter.

32:15.995 --> 32:17.295
The worst days of winter, I can't go.

32:17.330 --> 32:20.265
That's when those horses need me the most.

32:23.936 --> 32:26.971
Damn.

32:31.276 --> 32:33.811
Well,
I was happy to get your call.

32:33.846 --> 32:36.614
I didn't expect it so soon.

32:36.648 --> 32:40.351
So, uh, you've decided to accept my offer?

32:40.386 --> 32:42.353
Well, we have to uh...

32:42.388 --> 32:44.288
We have to know what it
is you're asking for,

32:44.322 --> 32:46.757
you understand, before we can...
before we can accept.

32:46.791 --> 32:49.193
What's to know? It's very simple.

32:49.227 --> 32:52.196
If you want me to stay away from Georgie,
it will cost you.

33:00.267 --> 33:02.939
That's per month. In cash.

33:02.973 --> 33:05.475
I don't think the government needs to know
about our little arrangement, do you?

33:09.013 --> 33:10.614
- What're you doing here?
- Georgie...

33:10.648 --> 33:13.182
How could you do this to my mom and dad?

33:13.217 --> 33:15.184
Honey, if it wasn't for me,

33:15.219 --> 33:16.752
you-you wouldn't know anything
about your own family,

33:16.787 --> 33:18.988
your real mother and father.

33:19.023 --> 33:22.758
Lou and Peter are my
real mother and father!

33:22.793 --> 33:25.694
I thought that you would
like to hear the stories

33:25.729 --> 33:27.530
and look at the photo albums and...

33:27.564 --> 33:29.966
I did, and that was amazing,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.767
and I wanted you to be my fairy godmother,

33:31.802 --> 33:34.269
I did.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.138
But you tried to take me
away from the only people,

33:36.172 --> 33:39.041
other than Jeff, that I've ever loved.

33:39.075 --> 33:42.010
Someone that loved me would never do that.

33:42.045 --> 33:43.779
I hope I never see you again!

33:43.814 --> 33:46.549
Honey, please!

33:46.583 --> 33:49.484
don't worry, Georgie,
your aunt won't be bothering you again.

33:49.518 --> 33:51.253
In fact, she's at risk of arrest.

33:51.287 --> 33:53.021
And who are you?

33:53.056 --> 33:55.457
I'm the social worker on this case,

33:55.491 --> 33:58.793
and I have to tell you
criminal charges may be laid

33:58.828 --> 34:01.029
for malicious and false accusations.

34:01.064 --> 34:03.547
Oh, not to mention soliciting a bribe.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.483
Oh...

34:06.201 --> 34:08.803
Well, well, well...
Aren't you two just so clever.

34:12.346 --> 34:14.282
Well...

34:15.199 --> 34:17.779
You're the one who's losing out, Georgie.

34:17.813 --> 34:20.511
You just remember that.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.202
You've been cleared.
Obviously, no further action will be taken.

34:42.235 --> 34:45.038
I'm sorry for all this, Lou. Peter.

34:45.072 --> 34:47.908
It's okay, it's over.
You... you did your job.

34:47.942 --> 34:52.178
No, I apologize. I acted...

34:52.909 --> 34:54.547
Well, I'm kind of new,

34:54.581 --> 34:57.283
and I was thrilled to get
asked to fill in for Clint

34:57.318 --> 35:00.086
while he was on holiday.

35:00.121 --> 35:02.282
I guess I was trying to impress him

35:02.302 --> 35:05.119
with how thorough I could be on a case.

35:06.693 --> 35:08.794
I wish you all the best.

35:08.829 --> 35:11.890
Georgie, you have a wonderful family.

35:20.273 --> 35:22.041
I'm sorry, Will.

35:22.075 --> 35:24.043
I know it didn't turn out like you'd hoped.

35:24.077 --> 35:26.546
Don't worry. It couldn't be helped.

35:26.580 --> 35:28.180
It's the way it goes.

35:28.214 --> 35:31.083
Yah! Yah! Yah!

35:43.496 --> 35:46.031
Yah! Yah! Yah!

35:57.643 --> 35:59.343
For my father!

35:59.378 --> 36:01.245
Hah! Hah!

38:28.956 --> 38:31.557
Well, here's to you dealing with Crystal.

38:31.592 --> 38:34.060
We did it together, Peter.

38:34.095 --> 38:36.862
And I hope I never hear her name again.

38:41.433 --> 38:43.920
But, you know, Abby is right.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.955
Georgie has an amazing family...

38:52.278 --> 38:55.080
And we need to keep it that way.

39:10.696 --> 39:14.165
The river looks different.

39:14.761 --> 39:18.050
Yeah, it's constantly changing.

39:27.579 --> 39:29.747
Do you remember what I uh...

39:30.089 --> 39:33.684
what I said before we... took that break?

39:34.507 --> 39:36.927
That I had changed.

39:38.801 --> 39:42.693
- Yeah.
- And you're right, I had.

39:42.727 --> 39:45.083
I was a nightmare when I
came back from that tour

39:45.103 --> 39:47.659
and I don't know how anyone put up with me.

39:50.712 --> 39:52.516
You know the other day when...

39:52.536 --> 39:54.645
you asked me what I wanted?

39:55.079 --> 39:57.207
Yeah.

39:57.759 --> 40:00.867
If you were to ask me that back home,

40:00.887 --> 40:04.549
I would've said that I needed to know
that we still want the same things;

40:04.569 --> 40:08.852
that we still share the
same dreams and goals.

40:09.645 --> 40:12.015
And now I know that we do.

40:13.926 --> 40:17.772
Because these last few days, I've been...

40:18.790 --> 40:23.433
I've been watching you and...
you are the same girl.

40:23.828 --> 40:26.436
You're the same girl that
I fell in love with...

40:27.421 --> 40:29.654
And more.

40:30.871 --> 40:34.877
Because you have changed,
and in a great way.

40:35.462 --> 40:37.746
And these last few months have been...

40:38.258 --> 40:41.720
They've been good for me too because...

40:42.812 --> 40:45.354
I discovered something.

40:45.976 --> 40:48.800
I discovered that I'm- I'm okay on my own.

40:49.569 --> 40:51.009
I am.

40:55.315 --> 40:58.633
But I know something else too.

40:59.510 --> 41:02.104
I don't wanna do it on my own.

41:05.231 --> 41:07.663
Amy, I wanna do it with you.

41:10.827 --> 41:14.786
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:31.738 --> 41:35.201
You made the right decission.
Even without my advice.

41:35.934 --> 41:38.703
I know! I'm so proud of myself.

41:38.737 --> 41:41.706
And good luck with the move,
and with your new guy.

41:41.740 --> 41:43.474
You were the one who told me years ago

41:43.509 --> 41:44.976
that I need to get myself out there

41:45.010 --> 41:47.812
and trust people, meet people,

41:47.846 --> 41:49.647
and I did it.

41:49.846 --> 41:51.315
It's your turn.

41:51.335 --> 41:52.948
Thank you.

41:55.820 --> 41:57.488
I'm so glad you're not selling.

41:57.522 --> 41:59.756
Yeah.
There's something about this place.
