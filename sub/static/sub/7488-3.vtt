00:10.630 --> 00:12.560
Excuse me, sir.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.870
We have a strict store policy.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.930
That only employees can take
instruments off the display.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.800
We don't want anything to break.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.910
Here you go.

00:34.590 --> 00:37.650
I've been waiting all day for something
bad to happen so I could do that.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.560
Something bad happened
this morning.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.860
When you put on that shirt.

00:42.890 --> 00:44.660
Zinger sting. Sweet!

00:44.700 --> 00:46.830
♪ What up?

00:46.860 --> 00:48.970
- Guess who got a job at the...
- The clown store?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.870
No, at the makeup kiosk.

00:53.910 --> 00:55.670
They pay us in free samples.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.540
And really? You're making clown
jokes dressed like that?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.780
Everyone stop picking
on my shirt.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.810
I'm talking about your shoes.

01:02.850 --> 01:04.650
Oh.

01:07.550 --> 01:09.690
Anyway, I have a big
announcement to make.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.620
- I just...
- Hold on! Don't tell us yet.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.500
I just booked you a gig on tv.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.470
Thanks! You're the
best manager ever!

01:23.500 --> 01:26.940
- Oh, what show?
- Only Miami's hippest music show,

01:26.970 --> 01:28.770
- "south beach sound."
- Awesome.

01:28.810 --> 01:31.710
- Oh sweet.
- Austin, this is huge!

01:31.740 --> 01:33.840
"south beach sound"
is a big deal.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.550
Do you know how many stars got
their break on that show?

01:36.580 --> 01:38.850
- No, how many?
- I don't know!

01:40.520 --> 01:42.590
When I get excited, I
ask a lot of questions.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.960
Why do I do that?

01:44.990 --> 01:46.590
Don't answer.

01:47.630 --> 01:49.530
Anyhow,

01:49.560 --> 01:51.536
They're coming to film Austin
here at the mall tomorrow.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.836
I told 'em you would
write a new song.

01:52.860 --> 01:55.570
Tomorrow? That's
not enough time.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.540
Hey, if I could get fired
from three jobs in one day,

01:58.570 --> 02:00.740
I'm pretty sure you
could write one song.

02:00.770 --> 02:02.010
Lazy.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.610
Well, we can write a new song.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.610
Luckily I have some new ideas in my book.
No worries.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.820
Oh no, my book is gone.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.490
It is not just a book.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.530
It is my diary, journal and
songwriting book all rolled into one.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.700
I write all my personal
stuff in there.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.470
If anyone else reads
it, I will die!

Where's my book?

Trish, can you get off if
my book is in there? N see.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.770
Yeah, sure. Whoa!

03:41.670 --> 03:43.740
Ah! It's not in there.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.810
I'm pretty sure there's
nothing in the tuba.

What kind of disgusting
person puts food in a tuba?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.850
Oh, my sandwich.

03:57.890 --> 03:59.690

Hello, Ally. I'm here
for my piano lesson.

04:21.810 --> 04:25.420
Uh, now is not a
good time, Nelson.

04:25.450 --> 04:28.390
And I've told you before you don't
need to bring your own piano.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.450
Oh, I forgot.

04:31.590 --> 04:33.390
Besides, your piano
lesson is tomorrow.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.560
Today is your oboe lesson.

04:34.590 --> 04:36.660
Aw, nartz.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.400
You know how hard it was.

04:39.430 --> 04:40.800
To g <i>this</i> on the bus?

04:42.670 --> 04:44.500
I'll be back.

04:51.510 --> 04:53.580
You guys look for my book here.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.510
While Trish and I check
the lost and found.

04:55.550 --> 04:57.880
I have to find it before
someone reads it.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.850
Some of the things I wrote in there
are super personal and embarrassing.

05:00.890 --> 05:04.420
Like how you have an imaginary
friend named Ms. Pennyworth.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.620
You talk to when
you're stressed?

05:06.660 --> 05:08.730
How do you know about Ms.
Pennyworth?

05:08.760 --> 05:10.760
I've only ever told one
person that secret.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.640
Well, obviously Ms.
Pennyworth has been.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.840
Blabbing about ya all over town.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.820
- Found it!
- My book?

05:32.850 --> 05:34.750
No, my lost and found t-shirt.

05:34.790 --> 05:36.590
From when I worked here
at the lost and found.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.590
Man, I hated this job.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.790
All those sad, desperate people.

05:41.830 --> 05:45.660
Searching for stuff they'll never
see again as long as they live!

05:47.430 --> 05:50.630
I mean we're totally
gonna find your book.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.820
What are you doing?

06:06.850 --> 06:10.550
Using my superhuman sense of
smell to find Ally's book.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.720
You have a superhuman
sense of smell?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.560
What food am I thinking of?

06:18.760 --> 06:19.860
Cheery pie...

06:21.470 --> 06:22.700
A la mode.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.770
Wow.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.650
- Found it.
- Wow, your nose is amazing.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.820
No, I didn't smell the book.
I just remembered

06:40.850 --> 06:43.490
I used it as a roof for
my gingerbread house.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.420
Why do you have a
gingerbread house?

06:46.460 --> 06:49.560
What, you want my gingerbread
man to live on the street?

06:50.590 --> 06:52.660
No, I want him to
live in my belly.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.670
Carlos!

06:57.470 --> 06:58.740
Come on, let's go find Ally.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.800
You know, it's a good
thing <i>we</i> found the book.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.610
And not some stranger
who would see.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.716
All the embarrassing personal
stuff she wrote in her book.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.410
Totally. It's gotta be
pretty juicy stuff too,

07:07.450 --> 07:09.530
Or she wouldn't be worried
about somebody reading it.

07:19.820 --> 07:23.460
- It's gotta be pretty juicy stuff.
- So juicy.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.700
What do you think?

07:26.730 --> 07:29.670
It's not like Ally ever told
us not to touch her book.

07:32.470 --> 07:33.640
Don't touch my book.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.840
Don't touch my book.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.610
Don't touch my book.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.880
Don't touch my book.

07:43.450 --> 07:45.420
Don't touch my book!

07:46.750 --> 07:48.550
Okay, what if we
didn't open the book,

07:48.590 --> 07:50.520
But it accidentally got
dropped on the floor.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.890
- And opened itself?
- There you go.

07:59.630 --> 08:01.760
Okay, what if it got
stuck to the ceiling.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.700
With something
sticky like jelly.

08:03.730 --> 08:06.470
And we could see the
pages from down here?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.570
- Yes.
- Nah, that's crazy.

08:08.610 --> 08:10.646
What are we gonna do, go all the
way to the store to get jelly?

08:10.670 --> 08:12.580
- By the time we get back...
- What do you need?

08:12.610 --> 08:14.780
I got grape, strawberry,
boysenberry.

08:14.810 --> 08:18.580
I got some jam, a bunch of
marmalades, some chutney.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.450
This is ridiculous.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.450
You're right. We
should just read it.

08:22.490 --> 08:24.620
No, I meant we shouldn't be
reading her book at all.

08:24.660 --> 08:28.360
We can't stop now.
This is good stuff.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.110
It's all about some guy
she has a crush on.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.530
Oh.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.429
Oh no. It's me.

08:38.470 --> 08:39.746
- Ally's got a crush on me!
- Shh!

08:39.770 --> 08:41.539
Don't spoil it. I'm
a slow reader.

08:41.570 --> 08:44.670
Uh huh, uh huh.

08:44.710 --> 08:46.840
Whoa! Ally's got a crush on you!

08:53.830 --> 08:55.700
I can't believe Ally
has a crush on me.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.740
I can't believe I
ate all that jelly.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.180
Ally's awesome, but I just
don't feel that way about her.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.440
We're two different people.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.050
She likes pickles,
I like pancakes.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.850
She likes reading books,
I like having fun.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.530
I'm cool and collected.

09:13.690 --> 09:16.480
And she chews her hair
when she's nervous.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.940
You want some
guacamole with that?

09:21.490 --> 09:24.100
Sorry. That's probably not
very appetizing to watch.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.330
I have an idea.

09:25.370 --> 09:27.330
Why don't we retrace
your steps from today,

09:27.370 --> 09:29.410
And maybe we'll figure out
where you left your book.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.110
Okay. I got here early,
so I wrote in my book.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.140
On the bench next to the
cellphone accessory cart.

09:36.180 --> 09:37.426
Then I went to work,
and on my break,

09:37.450 --> 09:40.150
I took a walk past the
cellphone accessory cart.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.150
Wait. Why do you keep talking about
the cellphone accessory cart?

09:43.180 --> 09:45.320
I'm not. I didn't.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.550
Why? Did the cute guy who
works there ask about me?

09:49.120 --> 09:50.460
No way.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.330
You have a crush on the
cellphone accessory cart guy.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.100
That's what you wrote
in your book, isn't it?

09:56.130 --> 09:57.530
What?

09:59.170 --> 10:00.530
The cellphone guy?

10:00.570 --> 10:03.200
That's crazy. Why would I...

10:03.240 --> 10:05.140
Holy unlimited texting,

10:05.170 --> 10:06.510
He is so cute.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.210
You never know. She might not
have been writing about you.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.110
I mean look at him...
his kind eyes,

10:12.150 --> 10:14.210
Hair that flops
just the right way.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.550
"kind eyes. Hair that flops
just the right way"?

10:16.580 --> 10:19.190
That's so me.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.260
"we work so close
to each other..."

10:24.290 --> 10:25.560
And yet we're so far apart.

10:25.590 --> 10:29.360
And he smells like a
fresh summer breeze.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.360
"like a fresh summer breeze."

10:32.530 --> 10:35.440
Oh yeah, that's
summery and breezy.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.300
"and what is cooler
than a guy named.

10:38.340 --> 10:40.270
After a city in Texas?"

10:40.310 --> 10:42.140
You're right.
That's you, Austin.

10:42.180 --> 10:44.540
And his name is Dallas.

10:46.550 --> 10:48.380
Be cool, here he comes.

10:48.420 --> 10:50.580
Excuse me.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.490
Oh, so you like
throwing trash away?

10:58.530 --> 11:01.530
Uh, yeah, I guess.

11:02.530 --> 11:04.430
No way. Me too.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.440
Oh. Okay.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.580
I wasn't done with that.

11:20.350 --> 11:21.550
What am I gonna do?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.550
I don't want things to be
all weird with me and...

11:23.580 --> 11:25.180
Ally!

11:26.420 --> 11:28.290
And Trish.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.160
I'm short, not invisible.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.330
No way. You found my book.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.476
Yeah, it was in the ref rig...

11:34.500 --> 11:37.300
I love you, I love
you, I love you.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.530
I am so relieved.

11:40.570 --> 11:43.240
Let's go work on that new
song for "south beach sound."

11:48.380 --> 11:49.480
Okay, let's get to work.

11:49.510 --> 11:53.310
I think we should...
why'd you shut the door?

11:55.420 --> 11:58.220
Because we always shut the
door when we write a song.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.620
It's more private.

11:59.650 --> 12:01.450
Maybe we should change that.

12:01.490 --> 12:04.390
What do we have to hide?

12:04.430 --> 12:06.390
We're writing a song up
here with the door open.

12:06.430 --> 12:09.200
Wide open.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.470
We should write something
totally different.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.340
For you to play on
"south beach sound."

12:15.370 --> 12:17.400
What about a love song?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.310
Wh about a "like" song?

12:21.310 --> 12:23.350
Come on, I've already got a
bunch of it figured out.

12:26.450 --> 12:28.580

Uh, you're acting weird.

12:59.150 --> 13:00.450
Are you okay?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.550
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just not
feeling this love song.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.250
Austin, I'm really
feeling this one.

13:06.290 --> 13:09.490
I think we're close enough that I can
tell you who the song is really about.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.066
If I don't hear it, it's not true.
If I don't hear it, it's not true.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.810
If I don't hear it, it's not true.
If I don't hear it, it's not true.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.100
I've never seen
Austin act so crazy.

13:21.140 --> 13:23.370
He ran out before we could
finish our new song.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.370
I wonder if he's
nervous about playing.

13:25.410 --> 13:28.110
- On "south beach sound."
- Nervous? Pfft.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.180
Austin never gets nervous,
especially about performing.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.150
Then why is he acting
so weird around me?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.180
It's because he's nervous.

13:35.220 --> 13:38.120
Austin always gets nervous,
especially about performing.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.723
- Dez? - I don't know anything!

13:39.735 --> 13:41.320
Why are you grilling me?

13:41.360 --> 13:44.160
Can't a guy put a new roof on
his gingerbread house in peace?

13:45.490 --> 13:48.560
Ally, I think Dez has something
he needs to get off his chest.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.560
Dez, make this
easy for yourself.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.430
You know I can't control Trish.

13:53.470 --> 13:54.570
Tell us what you know!

13:54.600 --> 13:56.540
You can hurt me all you
want, I'll never tell.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.470
I'll never tell!

13:58.510 --> 14:01.240
Oh, I'm not going to hurt <i>you.</i>

14:01.280 --> 14:02.560
I'm going to hurt your family...

14:03.540 --> 14:06.380
Your gingerbread family.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.280
Benjamin!

14:08.320 --> 14:11.450
We can do this the easy
way or the Trish way.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.420
I can't betray Austin.

14:14.460 --> 14:17.360
No! You monster.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.360
Dez, you can end all this
senseless suffering right now.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.430
- Tell us.
- Never!

14:23.460 --> 14:25.330
I wonder what Benjamin
would look like.

14:25.370 --> 14:27.130
Without a head. Hmm.

14:27.170 --> 14:30.070
Austin read Ally's book and
knows she has a crush on him.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.210
- What?
- There, now you know everything.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.210
What are you doing? I said
I told you everything.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.510
I know, but Benjamin's
really tasty.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.450
- Where are you going?
- To find Austin.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.280
And confront him about
reading my book.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.120
No. There's a better way
to deal with this...

14:48.160 --> 14:51.160
A little thing I like
to call revenge.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.130
And we're going to use
your book to do it.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.330
I love it. Don't touch my book.

15:06.830 --> 15:10.500
Hey Ally, I'm here
for my hobo lesson.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.540
Nelson, it's an <i>ob</i> lesson,

15:15.580 --> 15:17.710
Not a hobo lesson.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.410
Aw, nartz.

15:23.450 --> 15:25.820
You know how hard it was
to get <i>him</i> on the bus?

15:28.520 --> 15:29.860
C'mon, Uncle Hank.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.390
Austin's coming. Lipstick.

15:39.470 --> 15:41.470
Oh, mwah! Austin.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.470
Mwah! Austin!

15:43.500 --> 15:44.740
Mwah! Austin!

15:44.770 --> 15:46.670
<i>- Mwah mwah.
- Ally?</i>

15:46.710 --> 15:49.640
What are you doing? Is that
doll supposed to be me?

15:50.840 --> 15:52.880
Oh, Austin.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.550
Hi.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.720
Yes, it is.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.720
I was just practicing
what I would do.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.560
If you got bit by a rattlesnake.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.530
On the lips.

16:07.590 --> 16:09.630
It could happen. Oh.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.500
Good to know.

16:13.530 --> 16:15.530
So you wanna work on
our new song now.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.540
Here where everyone can see us?

16:17.570 --> 16:20.410
I can't right now. I'm busy.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.816
What private thoughts
are you writing.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.710
In your book of secrets, Ally?

16:26.810 --> 16:29.420
I'm just making a
list of turnoffs...

16:29.450 --> 16:30.750
Things I don't like in a guy,

16:30.780 --> 16:33.590
Things that if a guy did
I would definitely not.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.790
- Be interested in him at all.
- <i>Cool.</i>

16:36.820 --> 16:39.790
Wanna go to the food court and not
come back for at least 20 minutes?

16:41.730 --> 16:43.400
Sure.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.400
I'll just leave my
book right here.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.810
Read it. It's staring
right at you.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.610
Don't read it. It's
her private book.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.480
Read it. Then you'll know how to
make Ally not like you anymore.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.420
Don't read it.

17:05.690 --> 17:08.520
Guess who got a job as
your new conscience?

17:08.560 --> 17:11.420
- Hey, that's my job.
- Not anymore.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.760
Listen to the other guy.
Read the book.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.300
Read it, read it,

17:21.329 --> 17:23.800
Read it, read it,
read it, read it.

17:27.569 --> 17:30.340
"turnoffs: Guys with fake tans.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.540
Guys who sweat a lot."

17:40.720 --> 17:43.620
Hey Ally, how do I look?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.460
Orange.

17:47.660 --> 17:50.500
I know, right? It brings
out the color of my eyes.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.700
Ew. I hate fake tans.

17:53.730 --> 17:56.740
Really? I did not know that.

17:56.770 --> 18:00.810
Almost as much as I
hate sweaty guys.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.780
Also did not know that.

18:04.740 --> 18:07.650
Whoa. You look different.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.380
Yeah, 'cause I'm
orange and I'm sweaty.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.320
No. That's not it.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.720
That's exactly it.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.760
I'm trying to make Ally
not have a crush on me.

18:16.790 --> 18:19.530
And it's working. She hates
fake-tan sweaty guys.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.560
You really want to sweat,

18:21.590 --> 18:22.776
Try one of these
volcano peppers.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.470
They're crazy hot. They
only grow in molten lava.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.500
Oh perfect, thanks.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.340
The key is to take one little...

18:30.370 --> 18:32.370
Bite.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.570
Hot hot.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.380
Hot.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.780
Austin. Good, you're here.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.720
"south beach sound" wants to do
the interview with you right now.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.590
What? I thought
that was tomorrow.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.490
They moved it to today.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.460
You look like a wet Pumpkin.

18:50.490 --> 18:53.560
I can't go on live tv like this.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.530
We're here on live
tv with Austin moon.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.400
Tell us about your new song.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.670
Hot hot.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.700
I bet it is hot.
What's it called?

19:01.730 --> 19:05.540
- Water, water. - "Water, water.
" catchy catchy.

19:05.570 --> 19:08.510
Dez, drink... now.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.310
I wasn't thirsty but okay.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.280
Are you nervous about
being on live tv?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.320
You're kind of
sweating a little.

19:17.350 --> 19:20.550
Am I? Didn't notice.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.490
So tell us about your music.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.730
It's really very fun, you know?

19:27.760 --> 19:29.530
Peppers are really hot!

19:31.400 --> 19:33.470
Austin, I have one
last question for you.

19:34.630 --> 19:36.440
Why'd you read Ally's book?

19:36.470 --> 19:38.340
Huh?

19:38.370 --> 19:41.610
You know, my private book I
told you a million times.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.680
Not to touch? Why'd you read it?

19:45.380 --> 19:47.550
- I... we... wait, is this a...
- Fake interview.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.420
To make you look stupid as
punishment for reading my book?

19:50.450 --> 19:54.390
- Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
- Whoo!

19:55.520 --> 19:57.320
The camera crew was my idea.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.690
I'm really good at revenge.

19:58.730 --> 20:02.460
If there was a revenge
store, I'd never get fired.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.400
So that isn't the crew
from "south beach sound"?

20:05.430 --> 20:07.670
No, and I <i>don't have
a crush on you.</i>

20:07.700 --> 20:10.440
That's a relief.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.786
I thought I'd have to stay orange forever.
Okay, dez... towel.

20:12.810 --> 20:15.510
I'm not really sweaty, but okay.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.680
Listen, I know I shouldn't
have read your book.

20:20.710 --> 20:22.810
It was wrong and I'm sorry.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.820
I accept your apology.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.690
Um... But, you know, uh...

20:28.720 --> 20:31.460
There's still one thing
that bothers me.

20:31.490 --> 20:32.760
Why did you freak out so much.

20:32.790 --> 20:36.600
When you thought I had a crush on you?
Am I that horrible?

20:36.630 --> 20:38.830
No, Ally, you got it all wrong.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.630
You're awesome.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.700
I did that stuff because
you're my friend.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.670
And I don't want to
jeopardize that.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.770
I feel the same way.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.640
Let's hug when you're
less orange and sweaty.

20:51.540 --> 20:54.850
I'm just glad I didn't actually
make a fool of myself on live tv.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.680
Yeah, Trish wanted to
put this whole thing.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.520
On the mall jumbotron,
but I wouldn't let her.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.720
Wow, she really is
good at revenge.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.490
The best.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.490
But you know I wouldn't
embarrass you like that.

21:06.530 --> 21:09.360
Public humiliation is
my worst nightmare.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.330
That's why I freaked
out about my book.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.630
I mean, I would die.

21:13.670 --> 21:15.400
If anyone found out
I had a crush.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.770
On the cellphone accessory guy.

21:19.610 --> 21:21.470
What? The jumbotron?

21:21.510 --> 21:23.380
I thought we weren't doing that.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.720
What's up, mall of Miami?

21:36.390 --> 21:38.390
We are live on
"south beach sound"

21:38.420 --> 21:40.690
With the one and
only Austin moon.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.570
This song was written by my
good friend Ally Dawson.
