WEBVTT

00:06.104 --> 00:07.834
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:07.905 --> 00:09.373
<i>- Tool Time!
- Tool Time!</i>

00:09.440 --> 00:11.409
That's right!
Binford Tools is proud to present

00:11.476 --> 00:13.638
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:20.818 --> 00:26.280
Thank you. Thank you all very much.
Thank you.

00:26.357 --> 00:28.917
I am Tim "The Cool Man" Taylor.

00:28.993 --> 00:32.360
And, of course, you all know
my assistant, Al "Pine" Borland.

00:34.265 --> 00:37.929
All right. Well, today we're going to
talk about ski maintenance.

00:38.002 --> 00:41.166
Well, why did you bring your mom's
toothpicks out here?

00:41.272 --> 00:43.571
For your information, these skis were
handed down to me

00:43.641 --> 00:47.510
by my father,
who used them in the 1948 Olympics.

00:47.578 --> 00:50.047
Get out of here.
Your dad was in the Olympics?

00:50.114 --> 00:52.879
Actually, Tim, he was a biathlete.

00:52.984 --> 00:55.954
Don't ask, don't tell.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.020
Wow.

00:57.121 --> 00:59.750
I don't know why I bother sharing
anything personal with you.

00:59.824 --> 01:02.384
That makes two of us.

01:02.493 --> 01:04.052
These skis are made of hickory.

01:04.162 --> 01:07.132
A testament
to good old-fashioned craftsmanship.

01:07.198 --> 01:09.497
Well, and these skis are made
out of stainless steel.

01:09.567 --> 01:13.334
A testament to how much money
you can blow at a ski shop.

01:13.438 --> 01:15.373
No matter what kind of skis you have,

01:15.440 --> 01:16.944
it's a good thing to
keep them maintained.

01:16.974 --> 01:19.000
Right. Which brings us to
our first guest today,

01:19.076 --> 01:22.342
ski maintenance expert,
Dolph Schmetterling.

01:27.952 --> 01:29.011
- How do you do?
- Welcome.

01:29.087 --> 01:30.350
- Hi, Tim.
- Good to have you.

01:30.421 --> 01:31.980
Thank you very much.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.133 --> 01:43.499
Klaus!

01:44.936 --> 01:47.804
Sorry about that. Schmetterling,
that's a German name, correct?

01:47.872 --> 01:49.397
It means butterfly.

01:49.474 --> 01:53.570
Well, you must've been
a pretty big larva as a kid.

01:56.814 --> 02:01.980
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Not if you don't think so.

02:02.053 --> 02:04.147
- I don't.
- All right.

02:04.222 --> 02:07.249
So, Dolph, why don't you tell us
something about ski maintenance?

02:07.325 --> 02:08.485
Glad to, Al.

02:08.559 --> 02:13.429
I brought with me this Wintersteiger
automated ski service station.

02:13.498 --> 02:16.468
Look at the size of this bad boy!

02:16.534 --> 02:17.661
Bad boy is right.

02:17.735 --> 02:22.196
This Micro 71 model does
belt-sanding, base-edge tuning,

02:22.273 --> 02:23.901
deburring and cold waxing.

02:23.975 --> 02:26.843
It does everything but
cook your schnitzel.

02:27.845 --> 02:31.543
If I were you, I'd keep my schnitzel
away from that thing.

02:32.884 --> 02:34.088
All right.
Well, why don't we show them...

02:34.118 --> 02:35.756
The audience how this thing works.
All right, Dolph?

02:35.786 --> 02:38.950
Well, Tim, I thought we'd show them
how to maintain vintage skis first.

02:39.023 --> 02:42.482
Nobody cares about
those old Popsicle sticks.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.927
Never talk that way about wooden skis.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.862
I won't.

02:50.535 --> 02:53.061
While these two guys are stuck in
the nineteenth century,

02:53.137 --> 02:55.470
I'll show you how this thing works.
One-man operation.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.203
Wax them? Set them in like this,
turn this thing on like this.

02:59.377 --> 03:02.506
Apparently, you put it on nine.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.675
Hey, Mark, check out this brochure
from Boyne Mountain.

04:08.779 --> 04:12.546
They got some new lifts, they got some
groomed slopes. It's looking great.

04:12.617 --> 04:16.577
Wow! "Featuring hair-raising slopes
and teeth-rattling halfpipes."

04:16.654 --> 04:18.418
I love halfpipes, yeah.

04:18.488 --> 04:21.516
I love copper pipes.
I love exhaust pipes.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.561
Yeah, I can't wait to get up there.

04:23.661 --> 04:25.493
Honey, I don't know
why you're so excited.

04:25.563 --> 04:27.468
You know, you're not gonna be able
to ski on that knee.

04:27.498 --> 04:30.161
Oh, I know. There's bound to be a few
ski bunnies up there

04:30.234 --> 04:33.136
that want to cozy up
next to an injured soccer stud.

04:34.138 --> 04:36.664
Just don't tell them
you tripped over a rug.

04:38.576 --> 04:40.014
Go with something a little more manly,

04:40.044 --> 04:42.513
like you were
chasing the bulls in Pomona.

04:44.882 --> 04:46.646
Pamplona.

04:46.751 --> 04:48.311
- See you, guys.
- Bye. Have a good day.

04:48.386 --> 04:49.649
Bye. You too, guys.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.459
Honey, this is supposed to be
our winter vacation.

04:51.489 --> 04:53.561
- You sure you don't want to go with us?
- No, not this year.

04:53.591 --> 04:56.322
I have to finish my master's thesis.

04:56.394 --> 04:59.159
- Got a headache?
- No, no. Just really bloated.

04:59.263 --> 05:02.427
- My period's all screwed up.
- Hey, hey! Hey!

05:05.169 --> 05:06.467
- Sorry.
- Hello?

05:06.537 --> 05:07.537
Oh, hi, Patty.

05:07.605 --> 05:10.578
- How are you doing? You ready to go?
- You don't have time for some coffee?

05:10.608 --> 05:12.577
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- Okay.

05:12.677 --> 05:15.579
- Good morning, Patty.
- Morning, Tim.

05:17.248 --> 05:20.548
- That was a great <i>Tool Time</i> yesterday.
- We were pre-empted.

05:20.618 --> 05:23.747
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that.
I was just trying to be polite.

05:23.821 --> 05:26.985
Well, in that case,
your hair looks fabulous.

05:32.596 --> 05:35.031
I'm glad you're driving today.
I've got killer cramps.

05:35.099 --> 05:36.590
- Again?
- Yeah.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.472
And my period's been
unbelievably heavy this month.

05:38.502 --> 05:40.027
Yeah?

05:42.473 --> 05:44.237
Excuse me.

05:45.443 --> 05:48.072
When was the last time you've been to
see a gynecologist?

05:48.145 --> 05:51.513
- I don't know. It's been a while.
- Yeah? How long a while?

05:51.615 --> 05:54.779
I don't... Maybe like a couple of years.
I've been really busy.

05:54.852 --> 05:57.686
- Yeah, but I think it's time.
- Yeah, I know.

05:57.755 --> 06:00.122
It's bad, though, you know?
It's like a dam burst

06:00.191 --> 06:02.353
and the floodgates opened.

06:11.435 --> 06:13.927
I gotta get to some higher ground.

06:17.608 --> 06:18.837
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey.

06:18.909 --> 06:20.381
Getting your stuff ready for the ski trip?

06:20.411 --> 06:22.903
It's gonna be great.
We're snowmobiling this time, too.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.940
Plus, a five-hundred-foot vertical drop,
sixty-mile-an-hour shushing. Bam!

06:27.051 --> 06:30.215
It's gonna be great!
What are you doing next weekend?

06:30.321 --> 06:33.086
Taking my girls to Barbie Expo '99.

06:34.959 --> 06:35.999
It's gonna be kind of fun.

06:36.060 --> 06:38.154
I understand they're
unveiling her new Vette.

06:40.898 --> 06:43.197
Hello? Hi, honey.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.739
Oh, will you do me a favor? Pick me up

06:44.769 --> 06:46.307
at the gynecologist's office
in about an hour.

06:46.337 --> 06:48.363
Patty dropped me off,
but she couldn't stay.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.305
- You're not feeling any better?
- No.

06:50.374 --> 06:51.612
In fact, I'm bleeding really heavily.

06:51.642 --> 06:55.943
- I'm going through a tampon...
- Honey, honey, honey. Yeah.

06:56.013 --> 06:57.284
All right, all right. I got the message.

06:57.314 --> 06:59.874
I'll pick you up
at the gynecologist's at 5:00.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.009
Bye.

07:01.085 --> 07:02.123
That's about the only good thing

07:02.153 --> 07:03.657
that came out of
my separation with Nancy.

07:03.687 --> 07:06.054
No more gynecologist stuff.

07:06.123 --> 07:10.254
No more midnight tampon runs.
You can never get the right kind.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.499
"You idiot!

07:14.598 --> 07:17.568
"I said the super, not the slims!"

07:18.969 --> 07:22.462
Pads, panty liners. There's, like,
four thousand different kinds.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.408
Maxis, minis...

07:25.476 --> 07:28.241
Absorbent, super-absorbent,
with baking soda?

07:29.847 --> 07:34.342
My favorite. My favorite.
Ultra-slim overnights,

07:34.418 --> 07:36.387
with wings.

07:52.169 --> 07:55.662
Excuse me. I've got to pick up my wife,
Jill Taylor, at 5:00.

07:55.739 --> 07:58.573
Oh, I'm sorry.
The doctor's running late.

08:03.214 --> 08:06.378
- I guess I'll just wait here.
- Oh, there's a seat right there.

08:31.275 --> 08:34.143
You have enough room?

08:34.211 --> 08:36.270
Plenty. Yeah, thanks.

08:36.347 --> 08:40.114
Well, normally, I'm only half this size,
but I've gained 50 pounds.

08:41.452 --> 08:43.148
Do you have any idea what it feels like

08:43.220 --> 08:46.713
to be bloated and constipated
at the same time?

08:49.627 --> 08:52.096
My last pregnancy I gained 60 pounds.

08:52.162 --> 08:54.188
Oh, did you have trouble
losing the weight?

08:54.265 --> 08:57.758
No, I left half of it in the delivery room.

09:00.537 --> 09:01.766
Damn!

09:03.340 --> 09:06.037
Thirty-pound kid. That must have hurt.

09:08.545 --> 09:09.911
The baby was eight pounds.

09:10.014 --> 09:13.781
The rest was amniotic fluid,
afterbirth and discharge.

09:30.467 --> 09:33.835
I'm sorry, we must be making you
really uncomfortable.

09:33.937 --> 09:35.496
You think?

09:37.708 --> 09:41.201
- Are you going to breastfeed?
- Yeah.

09:42.179 --> 09:45.638
But I'm not looking forward
to those sore nipples.

09:47.184 --> 09:48.709
And the leaking.

09:50.254 --> 09:52.018
Excuse me.

10:14.011 --> 10:17.038
Do you have any magazines for men?
You know, like <i>Car and Driver,</i>

10:17.114 --> 10:21.074
or <i>Hooker and Handgun,</i>
something like that?

10:21.552 --> 10:24.522
I'm sorry, we don't get
much call for those.

10:24.621 --> 10:27.284
How about <i>Jack and Jill?</i>

10:29.226 --> 10:32.492
- I haven't read that issue.
- You want crayons?

10:32.563 --> 10:33.826
Do I?

10:37.134 --> 10:39.626
Mr. Taylor,
Dr. Fields would like to see you.

10:39.703 --> 10:42.263
I was just gonna color
the magic box first.

10:42.339 --> 10:45.002
He's with your wife in his office.

10:51.015 --> 10:53.246
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

10:53.317 --> 10:55.616
Lloyd, it's been awhile.
I haven't seen you since...

10:55.686 --> 10:56.847
Since I delivered Mark.

10:56.954 --> 10:59.981
You know, his head
finally did round out.

11:02.493 --> 11:07.397
Okay. So, why are we here?

11:07.464 --> 11:10.024
So, you know all those female
problems I've been having,

11:10.100 --> 11:11.405
the cramps, the heavy bleeding...

11:11.435 --> 11:14.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:14.571 --> 11:19.134
They're caused by a large fibroid tumor
on my uterus.

11:21.412 --> 11:22.971
A tumor?

11:23.047 --> 11:26.540
I'm afraid Jill's gonna need
a hysterectomy.

11:34.525 --> 11:36.994
Forgive me, but explain to me again
what a hysterectomy is.

11:37.060 --> 11:41.430
- Well, it's where we remove her uterus.
- It's major surgery.

11:41.498 --> 11:42.932
Oh, boy.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.127
The good news here is

11:44.201 --> 11:46.693
that these fibroid tumors
are almost always benign.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.109
Ninety-nine percent of the time.
That's what you said, right?

11:49.139 --> 11:50.698
That's right.

11:50.774 --> 11:53.141
Well, how will having no uterus
affect her?

11:53.210 --> 11:55.975
Will we have to get her a special dog?

12:01.385 --> 12:06.289
- He is joking, right?
- You can't be sure 100% of the time.

12:08.859 --> 12:11.829
It just means that I'm not gonna have
any more periods,

12:11.929 --> 12:14.296
and I can't have any more children.

12:14.398 --> 12:17.425
- We already decided on that.
- Yeah, I know, but I...

12:17.501 --> 12:20.596
You're just talking about a partial
hysterectomy, right? Not a total?

12:20.671 --> 12:23.641
There... There is a "totalrectomy"?

12:25.843 --> 12:29.336
Well, sometimes we also have to
do an oophorectomy.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.845
Yeah.

12:32.950 --> 12:36.443
Where you remove her "oophs"?

12:39.723 --> 12:40.782
Her ovaries.

12:40.858 --> 12:43.987
If you take my ovaries, then that's
gonna throw me into early menopause.

12:44.061 --> 12:47.520
I'm really... I am not ready for
hot flashes and mood swings.

12:47.598 --> 12:49.499
- I know you're not.
- Jill, at this point,

12:49.566 --> 12:51.626
I see no reason that I'd have
to take your ovaries.

12:51.869 --> 12:52.996
But

12:53.136 --> 12:54.900
we can't be sure until we get in there.

12:54.972 --> 12:57.407
Until "we" get in there?

12:58.842 --> 13:02.108
How many people are going in
and how long are they staying?

13:04.615 --> 13:06.311
When do we have to do this?

13:06.383 --> 13:08.818
I can work you in on Friday.

13:09.153 --> 13:10.891
- Friday? That's too soon.
- If you need surgery,

13:10.921 --> 13:13.227
- there's no reason to wait, honey.
- I have to finish my thesis.

13:13.257 --> 13:14.762
Can't we do this, like,
a week after next?

13:14.792 --> 13:19.526
No. Unfortunately, I'm leaving
on Saturday for three weeks.

13:19.596 --> 13:23.033
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to wait that long.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.305
Well, I guess I could just try to
finish my thesis by Friday,

13:25.335 --> 13:26.496
and whatever I don't finish,

13:26.570 --> 13:28.041
- I'll just do while I'm recovering.
- Good.

13:28.071 --> 13:31.041
Then I'll schedule you.
You have any questions?

13:31.141 --> 13:32.613
How long do I have to
be in the hospital?

13:32.643 --> 13:34.976
About three days.

13:35.045 --> 13:36.911
I've got a question.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.882
Why do those maxi pads need wings?

13:49.893 --> 13:53.022
It's my own stupid fault. I put off
going to the doctor for two years,

13:53.096 --> 13:56.260
now I got a tumor
the size of a cantaloupe.

13:58.702 --> 14:01.074
How do you think I feel? I've got this
hideous thing growing inside me,

14:01.104 --> 14:02.970
I didn't even know it was there.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.670
I hate the whole idea of
surgery and anesthesia.

14:06.743 --> 14:09.212
I hated it, too, the first 10 or 15 times.

14:11.281 --> 14:13.787
But I've come out smelling
like a rose, honey. It'll be all right.

14:13.817 --> 14:16.548
Honey, all you've ever had removed
were things that you swallowed,

14:16.620 --> 14:19.351
got stuck to, or sat on.

14:21.024 --> 14:23.084
I'm gonna go lie down.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.423
Can I get you anything?

14:24.494 --> 14:27.464
Yeah. Just tell me it's all a bad dream.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.866
Hey, Dad. Look what Ronny
lent me for Boyne Mountain.

14:32.936 --> 14:34.700
Hey, great.

14:34.805 --> 14:38.173
I got a little bad news, though. I think
we might have to postpone the ski trip.

14:38.241 --> 14:40.733
- How come?
- Well, something came up.

14:40.811 --> 14:45.476
It's not an emergency, but your mom
has to have some surgery on Friday.

14:46.984 --> 14:49.146
What kind of surgery?

14:49.553 --> 14:51.419
Women's surgery.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.352
Do you know what a hysterectomy is?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.928
- Not exactly.
- Damn.

15:00.964 --> 15:02.125
I was hoping you knew.

15:02.232 --> 15:05.566
Well, it's not serious as

15:05.635 --> 15:09.003
if she were to get
an oompah-pah-rectomy.

15:13.410 --> 15:16.039
- What?
- Hold on a minute. It's very simple.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.082
If you were to cross-section a woman,

15:18.148 --> 15:21.880
inside, it looks
like a moose head with antlers.

15:23.921 --> 15:26.755
And what they want to do is just
remove the moose head part of that,

15:26.823 --> 15:28.985
and leave the antlers intact.

15:32.663 --> 15:34.291
- What?
- What?

15:35.465 --> 15:39.698
Illustration would be good, here.
Think of your mom as a sink.

15:40.604 --> 15:43.369
She looks good on the outside,
runs hot, runs cold,

15:43.440 --> 15:46.933
but she's having a little problem
with the women plumbing department.

15:47.744 --> 15:51.476
Her disposal is stuck in the on position.

15:53.316 --> 15:55.689
She has to have it removed, because
she hasn't seen a licensed plumber

15:55.719 --> 15:57.278
in two-and-a-half years.

15:58.255 --> 16:02.625
But, good news is, she doesn't
really need the disposal anyway.

16:04.261 --> 16:06.628
I'm gonna go look it up on the Internet.

16:08.899 --> 16:10.099
Well, suit yourselves, fellas.

16:10.167 --> 16:13.660
But I don't think it can get
any clearer than this.

16:16.239 --> 16:18.378
Come on. Up and at 'em, honey!
We gotta get to the hospital.

16:18.408 --> 16:19.569
It's almost 4:30.

16:19.676 --> 16:21.882
- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Okay, okay. I think I have everything.

16:21.912 --> 16:25.679
I've got my clothes
and the hospital card and my thesis.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.244
Why are you taking your thesis?

16:28.318 --> 16:30.223
Well, I'm gonna be there for three days.
What am I gonna do?

16:30.253 --> 16:32.279
Just lie around doing nothing?

16:32.356 --> 16:34.484
Well, some people
use that time to heal.

16:37.861 --> 16:39.625
What are the boys doing here?

16:39.696 --> 16:41.756
They wanted to be up
when you took off.

16:45.902 --> 16:48.599
That is so sweet.

16:48.672 --> 16:51.301
Boys, come on! Get up! She's leaving!

16:52.909 --> 16:54.241
Bye, Mom. Good luck.

16:54.311 --> 16:57.475
- I hope it goes okay.
- It's gonna be fine.

16:57.547 --> 17:00.642
I'm not the least bit worried,
and neither should you be.

17:00.717 --> 17:04.085
By the time you guys are having lunch
at school, I'm gonna be out of surgery

17:04.154 --> 17:06.385
and back in my...

17:21.538 --> 17:23.632
Well, I guess we should go.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.337
Tim!

17:30.580 --> 17:35.314
- Tim!
- Honey, we gotta get going! Honey!

17:40.056 --> 17:42.753
They're not quite ready for you
in the operating room,

17:42.826 --> 17:44.658
so I'll be back to get you
in a few minutes.

17:44.728 --> 17:45.957
Well,

17:46.029 --> 17:48.123
I'll be right here.

17:48.198 --> 17:50.963
Hey, Tim!
What are you in here for this time?

17:51.068 --> 17:52.434
Hysterectomy.

17:52.502 --> 17:54.971
I guess that's the only thing left.

17:55.038 --> 17:56.802
Actually...

17:58.341 --> 18:00.173
How are you feeling?

18:00.243 --> 18:02.075
Fine.

18:02.178 --> 18:04.511
I wasn't fine when I first
heard about the surgery,

18:04.581 --> 18:09.645
but once I worked through my feelings,
now it's just...

18:09.719 --> 18:13.281
- I really want to go home.
- I know you're scared.

18:13.356 --> 18:16.053
What if they take my ovaries?
You know, once I get on that table,

18:16.126 --> 18:18.595
that doctor has carte blanche.

18:18.929 --> 18:21.421
Come on, he's not gonna take
anything he doesn't need.

18:22.999 --> 18:26.163
The guy's not working on commission.

18:26.236 --> 18:28.398
I don't know.

18:28.472 --> 18:31.965
He drives a really nice cervix.

18:34.511 --> 18:35.672
Lexus.

18:35.779 --> 18:37.270
I wish my mother lived nearer.

18:37.347 --> 18:39.907
She'd be good to have around
right now.

18:40.016 --> 18:42.850
You've had way too much Demerol,
my friend.

18:43.453 --> 18:45.319
Your mom drives you crazy
when you're sick.

18:45.388 --> 18:47.448
Well, that's just about little things,
you know?

18:47.524 --> 18:49.993
But this is big.

18:50.060 --> 18:52.086
She's good with big.

18:52.362 --> 18:55.025
And she'd keep you company
in the waiting room.

18:55.098 --> 18:56.436
Don't worry about me.
I'm in the hospital.

18:56.466 --> 18:59.026
I've got more friends here
than anywhere else.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.271
That's true.

19:03.006 --> 19:05.168
- Are you ready, Mrs. Taylor?
- No.

19:05.242 --> 19:06.972
Yeah, you are. You'll be fine.

19:07.043 --> 19:10.104
At 9:00, you'll be out, good as new.
You will, honey.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.274
- I love you.
- I love you, honey.

19:12.349 --> 19:14.318
I'll be waiting for you right here.

19:14.384 --> 19:18.754
Doc, I want you to bag up the parts.
I'm gonna check your work.

19:23.393 --> 19:27.057
<i>Dr. Hart to room 201.
Dr. Hart to room 201.</i>

19:29.633 --> 19:31.499
Tim?

19:32.469 --> 19:34.700
Hey, Wilson. What are you doing here?

19:34.771 --> 19:36.291
What are you doing
coming out of there?

19:36.339 --> 19:38.899
Well, I was delivering a baby.

19:38.975 --> 19:40.807
I got a call from the hospital
this morning.

19:40.877 --> 19:45.110
- They were short of midwife.
- Kind of a midwife crisis, huh?

19:46.583 --> 19:49.951
I'm between births right now,
so I wanted to come out and see if you

19:50.020 --> 19:52.182
- had found out how Jill was doing.
- There's no word.

19:52.289 --> 19:54.849
I mean, the doctor said this procedure
was an hour and a half.

19:54.925 --> 19:57.451
We're going into two hours
and 47 minutes now.

19:57.527 --> 20:00.691
Well, I wouldn't be alarmed.
Surgeries are often delayed.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.255
I hope that's it.

20:02.332 --> 20:05.268
You suppose I could
borrow that getup?

20:05.335 --> 20:06.973
Maybe I'll sneak in there
and see what's going on.

20:07.003 --> 20:10.371
I think the hospital
would frown on that, Tim.

20:10.473 --> 20:12.593
I just want to know that she's okay,
Wilson, you know?

20:12.642 --> 20:16.409
I can't stand waiting.
I feel like my hands are tied out here.

20:16.479 --> 20:17.970
You know, Tim, Mahatma Gandhi said,

20:18.048 --> 20:22.213
"The most potent instrument of action
is prayer."

20:22.319 --> 20:25.255
I don't really have one
on the top of my head.

20:25.322 --> 20:29.350
I'd love to say one right now
that I've always found very comforting.

20:29.426 --> 20:30.951
All right.

20:53.516 --> 20:55.542
Amen.

21:00.223 --> 21:02.228
All right. Let's give her
a couple of grams of ampicillin.

21:02.258 --> 21:03.578
- You got it.
- We're gonna close.

21:03.627 --> 21:06.290
I'll need a needle, sponge,
instrument count.

21:06.363 --> 21:08.332
Give me a Pean clamp.

21:09.599 --> 21:11.761
- Give me some Ochromic.
- We've got a problem here.

21:11.868 --> 21:13.496
She's going into shock.
