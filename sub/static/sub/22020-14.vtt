WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:04.632
As Americans,
we don't just have the right

00:04.664 --> 00:07.375
to protest racism and injustice.

00:07.438 --> 00:10.473
We have the duty.

00:10.568 --> 00:13.705
But when Jamal Tate
and Chris Taylor took a knee

00:13.739 --> 00:15.974
to protest police violence,

00:16.008 --> 00:17.575
they were suspended.

00:19.845 --> 00:23.236
They cannot suspend
our freedom of speech

00:23.322 --> 00:25.517
and our freedom to protest.

00:31.524 --> 00:34.592
Denny Woods' daughter running
an anti-police demonstration.

00:34.627 --> 00:37.224
I think that's the actual
definition of irony.

00:37.272 --> 00:38.305
Amazing.

00:38.340 --> 00:40.441
Racism is so American...

00:41.943 --> 00:44.578
That when we protest racism,
some people think

00:44.613 --> 00:46.614
we protest America.

00:46.648 --> 00:50.584
But protesting injustice, that's
what the flag stands for.

00:54.723 --> 00:57.025
I got no respect for this kid.

00:57.135 --> 00:58.926
I got six friends
who died for that flag.

01:01.463 --> 01:03.430
Any sign of David Dixon?

01:03.465 --> 01:04.598
Nothing yet.

01:07.402 --> 01:09.803
I didn't come all this way
to get herded like cattle.

01:11.473 --> 01:13.941
- Where you from?
- Battle Creek.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.542
You mean where David Dixon's from?

01:15.577 --> 01:17.277
Yeah. That's right.

01:18.713 --> 01:21.148
- You a follower of David's?
- Am I?

01:21.182 --> 01:22.616
If white men don't draw a line today,

01:22.651 --> 01:24.251
tomorrow we won't exist.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.454
- I'm Brian Walsh.
- Amos.

01:29.691 --> 01:31.792
Got eyes on Dixon. He just got here.

01:34.729 --> 01:37.231
Those people over there,
they hate our country, huh?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.869
Disrespecting our police,
disrespecting our flag, right?

01:43.643 --> 01:46.807
And my question to you is,
what are we waiting for, huh?

01:46.841 --> 01:48.509
Let's go do something about it!

01:54.849 --> 01:56.517
Heads up, these guys are on the move,

01:56.551 --> 01:58.128
heading your way.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.988
You don't deserve
to call yourself an American.

02:01.022 --> 02:02.923
That's right.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.692
You heard what I said.

02:08.863 --> 02:11.265
Go get your mom's welfare check, boy.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.499
Come on. You heard me?

02:12.534 --> 02:13.867
So, what's up? What you wanna do?

02:13.902 --> 02:15.669
You got watermelon in your ears, boy?

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.713 --> 02:25.913
I got you.

02:25.947 --> 02:27.860
I got you.

02:28.450 --> 02:31.618
<i>Attention, this is
the Chicago Police Department.</i>

02:31.653 --> 02:35.622

<i>Anyone failing to disperse</i>

02:47.435 --> 02:49.458
29 arrests so far,
disorderly and battery,

02:49.483 --> 02:50.676
Dixon isn't one of them.

02:50.701 --> 02:53.373
We finished sweeping the area.
No sign of Dixon.

02:53.408 --> 02:56.643
<i>Units at 21, we have
multiple calls of shots fired</i>

02:56.678 --> 02:58.378
<i>at the CCU West parking structure.</i>

02:58.413 --> 02:59.947
- West.
<i>- Floor unknown.</i>

03:14.109 --> 03:15.476
Body.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.741
5021 emergency.

03:27.776 --> 03:29.643
This is Antonio Dawson of Intelligence.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.578
I need the entire campus on lockdown.

03:31.613 --> 03:33.466
We have an active shooter
and one dead body.

03:33.491 --> 03:35.077
He's a black male, 20's.

03:35.108 --> 03:36.617
<i>I believe he's the basketball
player that was kneeling.</i>

03:36.651 --> 03:37.771
<i>Chris Taylor.</i>

03:39.654 --> 03:41.588
One shot to the heart, no witnesses.

03:41.623 --> 03:43.323
Tact, Patrol, SWAT swept the area.

03:43.358 --> 03:44.691
- Shooter's in the wind.
- Huh.

03:44.726 --> 03:45.959
Talk to Campus Security.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.795
- Get surveillance.
- Yeah.

03:47.829 --> 03:49.930
A lot of people here today.
Somebody saw something.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.431
Well, we know David Dixon
and Chris Taylor

03:51.466 --> 03:52.933
got into a fist fight.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.668
It set this whole thing off.
We can't find Dixon.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.003
Man, I'm texting Ruzek now.

03:56.037 --> 03:57.371
He said he's still working undercover

03:57.405 --> 03:58.372
with that gang in Michigan.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.506
Tell him to stay under.

03:59.541 --> 04:00.974
Maybe get a lead on Dixon.

04:01.009 --> 04:02.676
Sergeant?

04:02.710 --> 04:04.111
I just talked to Brianna Woods.

04:04.145 --> 04:05.579
She may have seen something.

04:07.382 --> 04:09.650
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

04:09.684 --> 04:12.619
Hey, Brianna. It's been a while.

04:12.654 --> 04:13.854
I'm Hank Voight.

04:13.888 --> 04:15.455
I remember who you are.

04:15.490 --> 04:17.457
So y'all gonna find out who did this?

04:17.492 --> 04:18.959
Well, you got anything
that might help us?

04:18.993 --> 04:20.661
No.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.497
I mean, this whole thing
just went off the tracks.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.632
Jamal.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.134
The team is meeting with the chaplain.

04:27.168 --> 04:29.636
Coach, I can't.

04:29.671 --> 04:31.638
- I gotta stay here.
- No, go ahead.

04:31.673 --> 04:34.041
It's fine. Your team needs you.

04:34.075 --> 04:35.642
You sure?

04:40.915 --> 04:42.916
Hey.

04:42.951 --> 04:45.352
Let's get you to a doctor, okay?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.553
Come on.

04:48.857 --> 04:50.924
Listen, we just wanna ask you
a few questions, all right?

04:50.959 --> 04:53.160
- I know the drill.
- All right.

04:53.194 --> 04:55.662
You saw Chris get into
a fight at the demonstration?

04:55.697 --> 04:58.899
Yeah. One of those Neo-nazis.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.567
Told Chris he was gonna kill him.

05:00.602 --> 05:03.103
- This guy?
- That's the one.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.504
Did you... Did you catch him?

05:04.539 --> 05:06.440
No, we're still looking.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.176
Listen, is there anything
we should know about Chris?

05:09.210 --> 05:11.044
We were friends.

05:11.079 --> 05:13.680
I've known him since we were freshmen.

05:13.715 --> 05:15.716
That's how I met Jamal.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.618
Jamal is your boyfriend?

05:17.652 --> 05:19.019
Yeah.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.922
I wrote the article about them.

05:21.956 --> 05:23.190
Which article?

05:23.224 --> 05:25.559
Two friends take a stand.

05:26.728 --> 05:28.862
Chris and Jamal came
from a tough neighborhood.

05:28.897 --> 05:30.864
Got the golden ticket
to a fancy college,

05:30.899 --> 05:34.201
and then they started
protesting the anthem.

05:34.235 --> 05:36.637
The boosters, the fans, the coaches,

05:36.671 --> 05:37.971
they were not happy.

05:38.006 --> 05:40.707
They were getting threats?

05:40.742 --> 05:43.810
There was just so much hate out there.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.580
- They became a symbol.
- Sergeant.

05:48.116 --> 05:50.450
- Hey.
- I hope these officers

05:50.485 --> 05:51.952
are treating you with respect.

05:51.986 --> 05:54.421
Hi, Daddy.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.989
- Doctor take a look at that?
- Yeah.

05:56.024 --> 05:58.425
Said it was fine.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.661
I heard you jumped into the fray.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.062
Couldn't help it.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.564
Well, some things don't change.

06:04.599 --> 06:05.966
You're lucky the police were there.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.801
Couldn't resist, huh?

06:09.938 --> 06:11.104
Sarge, can we talk?

06:15.777 --> 06:17.644
I know you and I have our differences.

06:17.679 --> 06:19.513
But this is about her.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.849
All that crap needs to be left behind.

06:22.884 --> 06:25.852
We need to solve this murder
before it sparks a race riot.

06:35.730 --> 06:38.198
Chris Taylor was a point guard at CCU.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.133
Local kid from the Wild Hundreds.

06:40.168 --> 06:41.768
Smart kid, too.

06:41.803 --> 06:43.637
He was pulling 3.5 as
a Political Science major.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.105
Any priors from the neighborhood?

06:45.139 --> 06:46.773
One. He got popped for a possession

06:46.808 --> 06:48.108
in high school,
he did community service,

06:48.142 --> 06:49.609
he was clean after that.

06:49.644 --> 06:50.644
Brianna said Chris was getting threats

06:50.678 --> 06:52.145
for anthem protests.

06:52.180 --> 06:54.147
All right, well check
Campus Security, social media,

06:54.182 --> 06:55.782
see if any threats are credible.

06:55.817 --> 06:57.784
The one person we know
was blogging threats

06:57.819 --> 07:00.053
against black athletes was David Dixon.

07:00.088 --> 07:02.289
Dixon's been on the FBI's radar
for hate crimes.

07:02.323 --> 07:04.524
He got busted beating
an immigrant in Indiana.

07:04.559 --> 07:06.493
Put him in the hospital
with a skull fracture.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.729
Never went to trial because
the victim got deported.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.030
Dixon and Chris got into
a fight at the rally,

07:10.064 --> 07:11.631
and Dixon's still in the wind.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.133
Hey, is Ruzek still
under with these guys?

07:13.167 --> 07:14.835
As far as we know.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.636
Okay, I just finished
with Campus Security.

07:16.671 --> 07:17.804
I got something.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.708
This is a basic timeline
of Chris' murder.

07:21.743 --> 07:25.012
It starts at 10:42. This is 10:47.

07:25.046 --> 07:26.980
And there's Dixon.

07:28.182 --> 07:32.686
Now, this is a different camera
ten minutes later.

07:35.023 --> 07:36.690
Two minutes after that...

07:38.860 --> 07:40.160
Can't see his face.

07:40.194 --> 07:41.895
Yeah, but you can see his jacket.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.697
I mean, it looks a lot like Dixon's.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.532
Let's find this guy.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.100
We already got him, Sarge.

07:47.135 --> 07:49.102
Ruzek arrested his Alt-Right
ass five minutes ago.

07:49.137 --> 07:50.604
Huh.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.706
Good, let's have a talk with him.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.544
Hmm.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.679
I don't get it.

07:59.714 --> 08:01.681
We were fighting for your side.

08:01.716 --> 08:04.084
- Hmm.
- We're pro police, man.

08:04.118 --> 08:06.153
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
what I don't get.

08:07.822 --> 08:10.323
I don't get this whole
white supremacy thing.

08:11.392 --> 08:13.560
I mean, judging from your record...

08:13.594 --> 08:15.295
your, uh...

08:15.329 --> 08:17.731
your contribution to society...

08:18.900 --> 08:20.867
Aside from beating up immigrants

08:20.902 --> 08:23.103
and blogging a bunch of hate,

08:23.137 --> 08:25.639
why exactly do you feel superior?

08:25.673 --> 08:26.640
I don't. That's why I'm not

08:26.674 --> 08:27.808
a white supremacist.

08:27.842 --> 08:30.944
- I'm a white nationalist.
- Oh.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.246
- Come on.
- Huh.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.116
People were meant to live
with their own tribes.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.284
There's nothing wrong
with saying that aloud.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.087
You and me.

08:40.121 --> 08:42.789
- We're the same tribe.
- Hmm.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.158
The same color, maybe. Not same tribe.

08:45.193 --> 08:46.893
All right, well,

08:46.928 --> 08:50.597
then explain something to me, officer.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.401
Black man can wear a shirt
that says, "Black Power."

08:54.435 --> 08:56.736
Lady wear a shirt that says,
"Female Power."

08:56.771 --> 08:59.306
But if I wear a shirt
that says, "White Power,"

08:59.340 --> 09:00.974
I'm a racist.

09:04.112 --> 09:05.946
David Dixon.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.781
My brother.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.083
- How you doing today?
- I'm good.

09:10.118 --> 09:11.751
Yeah?

09:11.786 --> 09:14.087
Big fan of your blog.

09:14.122 --> 09:16.289
A lot of anger, though.

09:16.324 --> 09:18.024
I mean, according to your words,

09:18.059 --> 09:19.659
you came to the city of Chicago
with intentions

09:19.694 --> 09:21.128
on starting a race riot.

09:21.162 --> 09:23.296
Um, I came to Chicago to exercise

09:23.331 --> 09:25.665
my first amendment right of free speech.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.134
Hmm, free speech. Now, listen.

09:27.168 --> 09:29.703
I don't really know
too much about the Constitution

09:29.737 --> 09:31.972
but I know free speech.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.008
And it ain't homicide.

09:48.990 --> 09:52.025
- Guys, that wasn't me.
- Okay, but this is you.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.295
And that looks like you, too.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.464
Following the young
Chris Taylor into the garage

09:57.498 --> 09:59.733
- where he was shot to death.
- Not by me.

09:59.767 --> 10:03.170
David, I know you like
that first amendment.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.906
And if I know anything about
brothers like yourself,

10:05.940 --> 10:08.074
you love the second amendment.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.709
I'm not a gambling man, but I would bet

10:09.744 --> 10:11.811
- that you own a gun.
- Ah.

10:11.846 --> 10:13.079
- Right?
- All right, all right.

10:13.114 --> 10:14.181
Could...

10:15.850 --> 10:17.450
What's wrong, Dave?
You own a gun, right?

10:19.520 --> 10:22.055
All right, yeah. I did follow him.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.390
- To kill him.
- Nope.

10:23.424 --> 10:25.258
No, I was gonna give him a beat down.

10:25.293 --> 10:27.027
Because he took a knee
for the national anthem?

10:27.061 --> 10:28.862
Because he disrespected our country.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.031
I got a brother, I got a uncle,

10:31.065 --> 10:33.733
I got two cousins in the Army,
and that flag,

10:33.768 --> 10:35.435
that means everything to us.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.270
Exactly.

10:37.305 --> 10:39.706
So you followed a young
Chris Taylor into that garage.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.208
Yeah, and then when I got there,

10:41.242 --> 10:42.409
I heard a gun go off,

10:42.443 --> 10:43.944
and I saw a man come running out.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.245
And guess what?

10:45.279 --> 10:46.947
It was a black man.

10:50.885 --> 10:52.886
Mmm.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.955
- It was a black man, huh?
- That's right.

10:59.060 --> 11:02.362
Well... well, you obviously
ain't color blind.

11:04.565 --> 11:06.032
You got a height, weight,
and age for him?

11:06.067 --> 11:08.902
No, all I know is he was black.

11:08.936 --> 11:13.473
But y'all don't wanna believe
a white guy, do you?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.408
I just want the truth.

11:15.443 --> 11:17.210
I don't care what color it is.

11:18.579 --> 11:20.280
Yeah, well,

11:20.314 --> 11:23.216
truth is you can silence me,

11:23.251 --> 11:25.552
but others who believe in the cause,

11:25.586 --> 11:28.221
they're gonna continue to fight.

11:28.256 --> 11:29.222
Brother.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.431
I'm sorry about your friend.

11:38.466 --> 11:39.766
I appreciate it.

11:41.369 --> 11:44.070
I saw you at the demonstration.

11:44.105 --> 11:47.107
In case you're wondering,
you don't pass for antifa.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.110
I know how cops think.

11:50.144 --> 11:53.413
You know how your father thinks, maybe.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.348
I'm sure you've got
no sympathy for athletes

11:55.383 --> 11:56.950
who kneel for the anthem.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.953
All right, to be honest,

11:59.987 --> 12:01.321
I don't know why people
are kneeling anymore at all.

12:01.355 --> 12:03.023
I mean, is it about freedom of speech?

12:03.057 --> 12:04.424
Is it about the President?

12:04.458 --> 12:05.959
It's about the police.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.428
It's about violence against black men.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.530
Then why disrespect the flag?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.165
No, you're wrong.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.267
Kneeling is actually a sign of respect.

12:14.302 --> 12:15.535
Kneeling, not kneeling...

12:15.569 --> 12:17.137
I don't think it's gonna
change anything.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.805
It's bringing more violence to the city.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.206
It's the last thing we need.

12:22.877 --> 12:24.110
Get down, get down!

12:28.082 --> 12:29.382
- Are you hit?
- No, I'm okay.

12:29.417 --> 12:30.617
All right, stay here. Don't move.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.522
5021 George. I got a plate for you.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.292
74 Paul Nora Tom 97.

12:39.327 --> 12:41.361
Shots fired at the police.
Black Jeep Wrangler.

12:41.395 --> 12:43.622
They're headed southbound,
4600 South King Drive.

12:47.747 --> 12:49.705
I got the plate,
but I didn't see the shooter.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.802
Huh.

12:50.883 --> 12:52.183
He had us dead to rights.

12:52.273 --> 12:53.774
Eh, he was a piss poor shot.

12:53.901 --> 12:55.435
Or he's just trying to scare us.

12:55.487 --> 12:56.754
Any other witnesses?

12:56.781 --> 12:58.582
No, not yet. We're still looking.

12:58.616 --> 13:00.450
Crime techs are processing some
of the shell casings.

13:00.484 --> 13:01.952
All right, get them to ballistics.

13:01.986 --> 13:03.853
Denny.

13:03.888 --> 13:05.422
Hey, Hank.

13:05.456 --> 13:07.691
So you're sure you didn't see anything?

13:07.725 --> 13:09.459
All I saw was a black car.

13:09.493 --> 13:11.528
It happened really fast.

13:11.562 --> 13:13.029
Dad, I'm kinda freaked out.

13:13.064 --> 13:15.932
Of course you are.
But you're okay, sweetheart.

13:15.967 --> 13:19.536
Hey, they were just trying
to scare you, all right?

13:20.771 --> 13:21.805
- Put a car at her place.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:21.839 --> 13:23.139
Where are you going?

13:23.174 --> 13:24.975
I gotta go to the Mayor's office.

13:25.009 --> 13:28.411
He's, uh, worried this thing
might spin out of control.

13:28.446 --> 13:31.381
- You're good.
- She's in good hands.

13:31.415 --> 13:32.782
Yo, Sarge, I think we got a hit

13:32.817 --> 13:34.451
on that Jeep Wrangler that we like.

13:34.485 --> 13:36.086
POD cameras just got tripped up
in Rosewood.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.454
All right, let's get on it.

13:37.488 --> 13:38.521
Come on.

13:40.591 --> 13:42.559
Hey, I appreciate you
looking out for her.

13:42.593 --> 13:43.893
I just pushed her to the curb.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.096
How'd you know it was coming?

13:46.130 --> 13:47.664
I was in Afghanistan.

13:47.698 --> 13:50.967
- You get a feeling.
- So, are you a soldier?

13:51.002 --> 13:53.003
Used to be.

13:53.037 --> 13:55.472
I respect all that y'all do.

13:55.506 --> 13:56.673
You know, you putting
your life on the line

13:56.707 --> 13:58.312
for your country and everything.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.677
That's legit.

14:00.711 --> 14:04.014
Man, look, I love this country.

14:04.048 --> 14:06.750
You know, that's why I'm kneeling.
I wanna make it even better.

14:08.219 --> 14:10.854
Brianna, we just have to ask,

14:10.888 --> 14:12.689
is there anyone that you can think of

14:12.723 --> 14:14.157
that would wanna come after you?

14:14.191 --> 14:16.126
Anyone that has a grudge against you?

14:16.160 --> 14:17.861
Like, do I know someone
who would shoot me?

14:17.887 --> 14:19.712
No.

14:19.897 --> 14:23.633
I assume it's the same
Neo-nazis who went after Chris.

14:23.668 --> 14:25.769
Before today, no other specific threats?

14:27.004 --> 14:28.872
No.

14:28.906 --> 14:30.940
What about you, Jamal? Any threats?

14:30.975 --> 14:33.943
No, I mean, other teams would talk trash

14:33.978 --> 14:35.979
to us for kneeling, but...

14:36.013 --> 14:37.080
Uh-uh.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.719
We got the ballistics.

14:42.753 --> 14:44.220
Bullets in the drive-by are a match

14:44.255 --> 14:46.056
to the bullet that shot Chris.

14:46.090 --> 14:47.691
Dixon couldn't have been
the shooter, then.

14:47.725 --> 14:48.825
He still could have ordered it.

14:48.859 --> 14:50.226
- Yeah.
- Or maybe not.

14:50.261 --> 14:52.896
We found the Wrangler from the drive-by.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.230
The VIN numbers were defaced,

14:54.265 --> 14:55.532
and the plates that Halstead gave us,

14:55.566 --> 14:56.833
stolen off another vehicle.

14:56.867 --> 14:58.568
Somebody wanted this car to disappear.

14:58.602 --> 15:01.805
Yeah, and it had a custom V8
LTI Corvette engine.

15:01.839 --> 15:04.574
Only 112 of them were sold in
this city the last two years.

15:04.608 --> 15:05.909
Only three were installed in Wranglers.

15:05.943 --> 15:08.011
And one of them belonged
to Marcus Bradley.

15:08.045 --> 15:10.513
The assistant coach of CCU.

15:10.548 --> 15:11.948
Let's talk to him.

15:14.218 --> 15:15.852
Coach Bradley.

15:18.622 --> 15:20.890
Thanks for taking the time.

15:20.925 --> 15:22.492
Where's the team?

15:22.526 --> 15:24.594
We suspended all basketball activities.

15:24.628 --> 15:27.597
Players are meeting
with the grief counselor.

15:27.631 --> 15:28.998
This about Chris?

15:29.033 --> 15:31.000
Actually, it's about you. Your car.

15:31.035 --> 15:33.002
2015 Wrangler.

15:33.037 --> 15:34.537
That's not my car anymore.

15:34.572 --> 15:36.606
I sold that last year.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.007
Sold it?

15:38.042 --> 15:39.609
You remember the buyer?

15:39.643 --> 15:41.077
No, I don't.

15:41.112 --> 15:42.779
I'm sorry, but how is this pertinent?

15:42.813 --> 15:45.014
It is pertinent because your
Wrangler was used

15:45.049 --> 15:47.684
in a drive-by shooting and
the target was Brianna Woods.

15:47.718 --> 15:49.786
- You know her?
- She wrote that article

15:49.820 --> 15:51.955
about Jamal and Chris
protesting the anthem.

15:51.989 --> 15:53.790
- Mmm-hmm.
- The bullets shot at her

15:53.824 --> 15:55.191
matched the ones that killed Chris.

15:56.827 --> 15:59.129
I'm not sure what this
has to do with me.

15:59.163 --> 16:02.232
I sold that truck.
Any further questions,

16:02.266 --> 16:04.634
you can take it up with my lawyer.

16:12.843 --> 16:15.111
Let's track his phone.

16:15.146 --> 16:16.980
Hey.

16:17.014 --> 16:19.082
Call just went through.

16:19.116 --> 16:21.818
<i>- What's up, Coach?
- Yo, K, how's it going?</i>

16:21.852 --> 16:23.620
<i>It's all good. What's the problem?</i>

16:23.654 --> 16:25.889
<i>Yeah, the cops, they know about the car.</i>

16:25.923 --> 16:27.724
<i>We gotta keep our distance.</i>

16:27.758 --> 16:29.959
All right, that call was made
to a Kendrick Gaines.

16:29.994 --> 16:32.128
Yeah, what do we know about him?

16:32.163 --> 16:34.264
Oh, nothing much but
some petty drug stuff.

16:34.298 --> 16:36.132
You know what? I got something.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.568
Uh, the possession charge that
Chris got in high school?

16:38.602 --> 16:40.670
The bond was paid by Kendrick Gaines.

16:40.704 --> 16:42.572
- Hmm.
- Let's grab him up.

16:45.176 --> 16:46.242
There we go. Get in it.

16:46.277 --> 16:48.611
Press, press, press.

16:48.646 --> 16:50.947
That's money, man. That's foul money!

16:50.981 --> 16:52.916
Watch his hips, homie. Watch his hips!

16:53.984 --> 16:56.686
Come on, man! Be strong with the ball!

16:56.720 --> 16:58.588
Go ahead, man! Do that!

16:58.622 --> 16:59.989
Hey, hey. Kendrick Gaines?

17:00.024 --> 17:01.257
That's me.

17:02.326 --> 17:04.993
Check out the kid in the red shorts.

17:05.029 --> 17:07.196
Little man can ball.

17:07.231 --> 17:08.330
You a scout?

17:08.365 --> 17:09.699
Africa they dig for diamonds.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.134
In the Wild Hundreds,

17:11.167 --> 17:12.669
we dig for Michael Jordans.

17:12.703 --> 17:14.002
What do you get if you find one?

17:14.038 --> 17:17.006
Satisfaction and free tickets.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.809
And a new Jeep Wrangler
from Coach Bradley from CCU.

17:21.412 --> 17:24.881
You helped Coach Bradley
recruit Jamal and Chris, right?

17:24.915 --> 17:27.116
My boys wanted to stay close to home.

17:27.151 --> 17:29.052
Maybe too close for Chris, huh?

17:29.086 --> 17:31.221
I mean, maybe sometimes
it's better to grow

17:31.255 --> 17:33.623
away from your roots.

17:36.026 --> 17:38.061
Y'all never had beef?

17:38.095 --> 17:39.796
No, we were cool.

17:41.899 --> 17:43.366
Hey, y'all go look,

17:43.400 --> 17:45.735
I ain't have nothing
to do with what went down.

17:45.769 --> 17:47.737
It's just that we checked
the phone records,

17:47.771 --> 17:51.140
and the last person that Chris
talked to before he was killed

17:51.175 --> 17:52.876
was you.

17:52.910 --> 17:54.210
I talk to my boy all the time.

17:54.245 --> 17:55.912
- It's just coincidence.
- Coincidence?

17:55.946 --> 17:59.382
Yesterday your Wrangler
was used in a drive-by,

17:59.416 --> 18:01.184
and the bullets that were shot
from the vehicle

18:01.218 --> 18:02.919
were the same ones
that killed Chris Taylor.

18:02.953 --> 18:05.154
Look, on my soul,
I had nothing to do with that.

18:05.189 --> 18:06.689
My car got took last week.

18:06.724 --> 18:08.157
Well, that's incredibly convenient.

18:08.192 --> 18:09.893
You reported it, right?

18:09.927 --> 18:11.928
Like the CPD was gonna make
it a top priority.

18:11.962 --> 18:12.929
Look, I wasn't into it with Chris,

18:12.963 --> 18:14.063
and my car got took.

18:14.098 --> 18:15.365
What else y'all want from me?

18:15.399 --> 18:16.933
I think we're good.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.669
Unless you got alibi
for yesterday morning.

18:19.703 --> 18:21.738
I was right here with my boy, Trey.

18:21.772 --> 18:24.374
- Trey?
- That true, Trey?

18:24.408 --> 18:26.442
You heard, folks.

18:26.477 --> 18:28.011
Trey confirms.

18:29.079 --> 18:30.246
Thank you for your time.

18:30.281 --> 18:32.682
Thank you.

18:32.716 --> 18:33.783
Hey, Ops.

18:33.817 --> 18:35.118
- Ops!
- Is that us?

18:35.152 --> 18:37.720
- You gotta be kidding.
- I think so.

18:39.723 --> 18:41.691
It's a shame what happened to Chris.

18:42.993 --> 18:44.694
For real.

18:47.431 --> 18:49.198
He lying his ass off.

18:49.233 --> 18:50.900
Yeah.

18:50.935 --> 18:53.202
Now we just gotta prove it.

19:03.847 --> 19:07.283
Black kid at a white college
kneels for the anthem.

19:07.318 --> 19:10.920
Risks suspension for something
he believes in.

19:10.955 --> 19:14.057
Takes a lot of guts. I'll give him that.

19:19.797 --> 19:20.897
Did you see this?

19:23.867 --> 19:25.335
Let's find out.

19:32.376 --> 19:35.244
I'm sorry, Brianna,
we need to talk to you.

19:35.279 --> 19:36.846
Yeah, what is it?

19:36.880 --> 19:39.182
Do you know a guy named Kendrick Gaines?

19:39.216 --> 19:41.084
No, doesn't ring a bell. Why?

19:42.786 --> 19:43.987
You're on his Facebook page.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.777
How do you know Kendrick Gaines?

19:57.033 --> 19:59.530
- I don't really know him.
- Huh.

19:59.580 --> 20:02.648
Maybe I saw him at some party.

20:02.691 --> 20:03.958
We checked your phone.

20:03.992 --> 20:05.659
You called him three times last month.

20:07.329 --> 20:10.209
Look, Brianna, I'm trying to help.

20:10.472 --> 20:11.806
Okay?

20:11.933 --> 20:14.326
You need to be honest with me.

20:14.703 --> 20:17.153
Why'd you call him?

20:17.224 --> 20:18.672
I was just trying to score some weed.

20:18.707 --> 20:20.114
You're a college student.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.842
You don't need a gangbanger
from The Wild Hundreds

20:21.877 --> 20:23.544
to find pot.

20:25.347 --> 20:27.214
Honey, someone just tried to kill you.

20:27.249 --> 20:28.549
You need to be honest with me.

20:30.452 --> 20:31.986
What in the hell is going on in here?

20:32.020 --> 20:34.321
- Daddy...
- Do you remember the talk?

20:34.356 --> 20:36.357
Denny, we're just having a conversation.

20:36.391 --> 20:39.860
Do you remember the talk?

20:39.895 --> 20:42.529
- Of course I do.
- You never run from a cop.

20:42.564 --> 20:45.366
You never talk to one without a lawyer.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.001
- He's your friend.
- Is he a cop?

20:58.280 --> 21:00.447
I can't believe you started without me.

21:00.482 --> 21:01.882
Denny...

21:01.917 --> 21:03.684
What is this really about, Hank, huh?

21:03.718 --> 21:06.453
This is about me trying
to solve a homicide

21:06.488 --> 21:07.788
and trying to help your daughter.

21:07.822 --> 21:09.890
Nothing more.

21:09.925 --> 21:13.394
You ask me, she's in trouble
with some very rough people.

21:15.430 --> 21:18.465
Must be related to her boyfriend, Jamal.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.401
Comes straight from the hood.

21:20.435 --> 21:23.404
Well, all we've got so far is
she knows our lead suspect.

21:23.438 --> 21:25.639
It's a gangbanger named Kendrick Gaines.

21:25.674 --> 21:27.074
We don't know how or why.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.044
Let me talk to her.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.383
Hey.

21:36.418 --> 21:37.818
Hey.

21:37.852 --> 21:39.553
<i>Can we go now?</i>

21:43.591 --> 21:45.793
<i>No.</i>

21:45.827 --> 21:47.761
<i>We need to get to some truth.</i>

22:00.508 --> 22:02.910
Sweetheart.

22:02.944 --> 22:04.945
You're an idealist.

22:04.980 --> 22:07.614
You think you can change the world.

22:07.649 --> 22:10.084
<i>But I'm a cop. I see the darkness.</i>

22:10.118 --> 22:11.952
<i>And the only thing that scares me...</i>

22:11.987 --> 22:16.323
The only thing is that
the darkness will find you.

22:17.525 --> 22:20.627
Brianna, you are my life.

22:20.662 --> 22:21.795
And you're in trouble.

22:23.665 --> 22:26.100
But how do you know Kendrick Gaines?

22:29.704 --> 22:32.139
I was trying to protect Jamal.

22:32.173 --> 22:33.874
So he could play basketball.

22:33.908 --> 22:36.143
All right, go ahead.
Just tell me what happened.

22:39.481 --> 22:41.015
A couple months ago,
I found lots of cash

22:41.049 --> 22:42.850
in Jamal's drawer.

22:42.884 --> 22:45.452
I knew it was suspicious,
so I confronted him.

22:45.487 --> 22:48.389
- Drugs?
- No.

22:48.423 --> 22:50.657
- Gambling.
- What do you mean?

22:53.928 --> 22:55.696
Chris and Jamal had been
getting money from Kendrick

22:55.730 --> 22:57.398
since they were kids.

22:57.432 --> 22:59.466
Then Kendrick wanted some payback.

22:59.501 --> 23:02.469
Wanted them to shave points.

23:02.504 --> 23:04.872
You know, miss a few shots
here and there.

23:04.906 --> 23:06.673
I knew I was right about this Jamal.

23:06.708 --> 23:09.009
No, it's not his fault.
He didn't want to do it.

23:09.044 --> 23:12.579
He was scared it would hurt
his chances of turning pro.

23:12.614 --> 23:15.082
Kendrick threatened him.

23:15.116 --> 23:16.683
That's why I called.

23:18.553 --> 23:20.687
I'm not following.

23:20.722 --> 23:23.857
I told him if he didn't stop
squeezing Jamal and Chris

23:23.892 --> 23:26.026
that I was going to tell my father.

23:28.863 --> 23:31.031
That's why Kendrick tried to shoot you.

23:34.569 --> 23:36.870
I thought I could handle this.

23:36.905 --> 23:39.039
I didn't... I didn't know... I...

23:39.074 --> 23:42.042
Yeah, well...

23:42.077 --> 23:44.545
Now you do.

24:04.466 --> 24:06.100
Man, this is a nightmare.

24:06.134 --> 24:07.901
My worst dream is actually coming true.

24:07.936 --> 24:09.970
You were shaving points.
What did you expect?

24:10.004 --> 24:11.905
Not the last game. Coach benched me.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.774
- Hmm.
- Took money for other games?

24:15.643 --> 24:17.578
A few.

24:17.612 --> 24:19.980
Kendrick has been giving me
money since I was 12 years old.

24:20.014 --> 24:22.483
When I didn't know no better.

24:22.517 --> 24:25.452
Once you start, he don't let you stop.

24:25.487 --> 24:27.654
And Kendrick told you
and Chris to fix this game

24:27.689 --> 24:29.490
- two nights ago?
- That's right.

24:29.524 --> 24:32.126
And you knew the coach would
bench you if you knelt

24:32.160 --> 24:34.261
during the anthem.

24:34.295 --> 24:36.497
So taking a knee was your way
of shaving points?

24:36.531 --> 24:38.565
- No, that's not why we did it.
- Okay.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.801
We was gonna play, make sure we won.

24:40.835 --> 24:42.769
Just not by too many points.

24:42.804 --> 24:44.104
Then why'd you take a knee?

24:49.010 --> 24:51.078
Because Brianna showed up.

24:51.112 --> 24:52.779
She wasn't even supposed to be there,

24:52.814 --> 24:57.584
but when I saw her,
I... I couldn't back down.

24:57.619 --> 25:00.687
You know? I couldn't let her down.

25:00.722 --> 25:02.256
All right, you took a knee for Brianna.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.924
Yeah. I mean, that wasn't

25:03.958 --> 25:06.126
the only reason, but...

25:07.162 --> 25:08.929
She opened my mind to a lot of things.

25:08.963 --> 25:11.832
All right, why'd Chris take a knee?

25:17.805 --> 25:20.140
Because he my friend.

25:20.175 --> 25:22.709
And we always had each other's back.

25:22.744 --> 25:24.611
I thought it would still work.

25:24.646 --> 25:25.946
You know, I figured we wouldn't
score so much

25:25.980 --> 25:28.148
if neither one of us played.

25:28.183 --> 25:30.951
But then this freshman, Freddy Mosely,

25:30.985 --> 25:32.853
goes off for 36 points.

25:32.887 --> 25:34.788
Has the best game of his life.

25:34.822 --> 25:37.024
Kendrick lost a lot of money.

25:37.058 --> 25:39.059
He said me and Chris had to pay.

25:39.093 --> 25:41.862
Look, Jamal,

25:41.896 --> 25:44.665
we can help you.

25:44.699 --> 25:47.734
You gotta help us.

25:47.769 --> 25:50.003
We need you to wear a wire, man.

25:50.038 --> 25:51.338
We gotta get a confession
out of Kendrick.

25:51.372 --> 25:52.806
You already know he killed Chris.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.175
But we don't have proof.

25:55.210 --> 25:58.745
Kendrick was smart. Covered his tracks.

26:03.017 --> 26:05.552
If I do this wire...

26:06.854 --> 26:09.223
I get to go back to playing ball, right?

26:12.927 --> 26:14.661
Yeah, Jamal's willing to cooperate,

26:14.696 --> 26:16.363
but the ASA is playing hardball.

26:16.397 --> 26:18.999
- Well, what is she offering?
- Not much.

26:19.033 --> 26:21.201
Look, there's the gambling,
plus obstruction,

26:21.236 --> 26:23.370
he's got a prior for possession.

26:23.404 --> 26:25.906
She's pushing for jail time.

26:25.940 --> 26:28.008
I need your help to push back.

26:28.042 --> 26:30.844
Yeah, but if the ASA thinks
jail time is appropriate,

26:30.878 --> 26:32.112
we should honor her recommendation.

26:32.146 --> 26:34.047
Ah, Denny, it's all a negotiation.

26:34.082 --> 26:35.048
- You know that.
- Yeah, well,

26:35.083 --> 26:36.917
Jamal broke the law.

26:38.419 --> 26:40.754
We're talking about
your daughter's boyfriend.

26:41.789 --> 26:44.258
Boyfriends come and go, Hank.

26:44.292 --> 26:46.627
Brianna was sowing
a few wild oats in college

26:46.661 --> 26:48.395
with a bad boy from the Wild Hundreds.

26:48.429 --> 26:51.732
But now it's time for my
daughter to get serious

26:51.766 --> 26:54.034
and start a new chapter in her life.

26:54.068 --> 26:55.936
And Jamal will not
be part of that chapter.

26:55.970 --> 26:58.639
He does not get a pass.

27:06.055 --> 27:08.789
So Sarge, we gonna work out
that deal for Jamal?

27:08.823 --> 27:10.223
The ASA's working on it.

27:10.258 --> 27:11.491
Okay, you think it's
gonna happen, though?

27:11.516 --> 27:13.784
I said ASA is working on it.

27:13.828 --> 27:15.028
Okay.

27:15.063 --> 27:16.120
Jamal just talked to Kendrick.

27:16.145 --> 27:18.298
The meet is set at Squire Lounge

27:18.332 --> 27:19.966
on the south side at 7.

27:20.001 --> 27:22.903
I'm checking the layout out now.

27:22.937 --> 27:25.505
We've got one street entrance,
one exit out the back.

27:25.540 --> 27:28.075
Antonio and Olinsky are setting
Jamal up with a wire.

27:28.109 --> 27:30.243
As soon as we get Kendrick's confession,

27:30.278 --> 27:32.379
on my signal, we scoop him up.

27:32.413 --> 27:33.914
And we're not taking any chances.

27:33.948 --> 27:35.015
This guy is dangerous.

27:37.418 --> 27:41.521
Dad, I really appreciate
everything you've done.

27:44.258 --> 27:46.393
You're my daughter, sweetheart.

27:46.427 --> 27:48.528
I'm just so glad this is gonna be over.

27:48.563 --> 27:52.866
Jamal can finally get back
to basketball and his career.

27:55.136 --> 27:56.403
Uh, Brianna, there's something

27:56.437 --> 27:57.871
that you need to know.

27:57.905 --> 27:59.873
Um...

27:59.907 --> 28:03.343
Jamal is not going to be
able to come back from this.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.945
What do you mean?

28:04.979 --> 28:08.248
It's gambling.
That's the one sin in sports

28:08.282 --> 28:10.250
that is never forgiven.

28:10.284 --> 28:12.385
But I just talked to him.
They gave him a deal.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.920
They said if he just cooperated...

28:13.955 --> 28:16.957
He might avoid jail time. He might.

28:16.991 --> 28:18.125
If he's lucky.

28:19.627 --> 28:21.928
It's time for you to stop
worrying about Jamal

28:21.963 --> 28:24.931
and focus on yourself. On your life.

28:24.966 --> 28:26.533
Excuse me?

28:29.070 --> 28:31.104
Jamal's path and your path

28:31.139 --> 28:33.440
are going in completely
different directions.

28:33.474 --> 28:36.143
You are an extraordinary young woman,

28:36.177 --> 28:39.112
and one day you'll find a man
who deserves you.

28:39.147 --> 28:40.981
And you don't think Jamal deserves me?

28:41.015 --> 28:42.582
Because he kneeled for
the national anthem?

28:42.617 --> 28:44.284
- Brianna...
- Taking a stand

28:44.318 --> 28:46.286
- bothers you that much?
- Of course it bothers me.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.288
I'm a cop. He was protesting me.

28:48.322 --> 28:49.956
No, he was protesting racism.

28:49.991 --> 28:51.825
He was giving me the middle finger.

29:00.368 --> 29:03.270
Brianna...

29:03.304 --> 29:06.940
I have known you longer
than you've known yourself.

29:06.974 --> 29:11.111
I know things about your heart
you have yet to discover.

29:11.145 --> 29:14.314
Sweetheart, he's wrong for you.

29:14.348 --> 29:15.615
You mean because he comes from

29:15.650 --> 29:16.950
the wrong part of the city?

29:16.984 --> 29:18.185
Or has tattoos?

29:18.219 --> 29:21.321
Or he's the wrong kind of black?

29:24.325 --> 29:26.526
There's more to it than just that.

29:30.198 --> 29:31.298
Brianna...

29:33.167 --> 29:35.135
Brianna!

29:35.169 --> 29:38.104
Brianna...

29:54.722 --> 29:57.057
You all right?

29:57.091 --> 29:58.325
You seem a little distracted.

30:01.696 --> 30:03.530
Yeah, it's this Bingham thing.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.635
Woods said they found a slug
in the body.

30:08.669 --> 30:10.470
So?

30:10.504 --> 30:13.240
They traced it back to a gun
registered to this punk

30:13.274 --> 30:15.575
I pinched five years ago.

30:15.610 --> 30:17.611
Never recovered the gun.

30:20.081 --> 30:21.615
Makes me a suspect.

30:23.084 --> 30:26.386
- He's bluffing.
- No, he's not.

30:26.420 --> 30:28.455
He's coming after me, Al.

30:30.024 --> 30:31.258
I thought you two had a truce?

30:31.292 --> 30:32.692
Yeah, well, it ain't gonna last.

30:32.727 --> 30:34.527
He wants me too bad.

30:37.064 --> 30:38.131
Mmm.

30:44.105 --> 30:45.605
All right, listen up.

30:45.640 --> 30:49.009
Suspect is on location.
He's with another male.

30:49.043 --> 30:51.077
<i>African American, blue coat.</i>

30:52.413 --> 30:54.080
I don't know if I can do this, man.

30:54.115 --> 30:55.715
I think maybe I need to be
talking to a lawyer.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.050
Who's blowing up your phone?

30:59.253 --> 31:00.553
Yo, Kendrick.

31:03.224 --> 31:05.625
- You wanted to talk.
- Yeah.

31:10.231 --> 31:13.466
<i>Look, the thing is,
ever since Chris got killed,</i>

31:13.501 --> 31:15.402
there's been a lot of police around.

31:15.436 --> 31:16.703
And what'd you tell them?

31:16.737 --> 31:18.605
- Nothing.
- That's right.

31:18.639 --> 31:20.573
Nothing for them to know.

31:20.608 --> 31:22.208
The only thing you gotta worry
about is getting me back

31:22.243 --> 31:23.310
that money I lost.

31:23.344 --> 31:25.278
Bro, I can't keep doing that.

31:25.313 --> 31:27.580
I keep throwing up bad games,
it's gonna kill my career.

31:30.618 --> 31:32.285
What?

31:32.320 --> 31:34.054
You still think you're going to the NBA?

31:35.523 --> 31:37.157
That is no longer happening.

31:37.191 --> 31:39.659
- I still got a shot.
- Had a shot.

31:39.694 --> 31:41.394
But that knee injury you got
when you were a freshman,

31:41.429 --> 31:42.729
you lost half a step.

31:42.763 --> 31:44.297
Half a step, that's...

31:44.332 --> 31:45.999
That's 100 miles in the NBA.

31:46.033 --> 31:49.469
- That's... that's a lie.
- Sadly, it's the truth.

31:49.503 --> 31:51.471
And when all this is over, my brother,

31:51.505 --> 31:54.107
I'm all you got left.

31:54.141 --> 31:56.109
So.

31:58.646 --> 32:00.080
Why'd you think you could play me?

32:00.114 --> 32:01.414
Bro, I didn't...

32:04.318 --> 32:07.120
Freddy Mosley went off for 36 points.

32:07.154 --> 32:08.822
Who in the world could have
saw that happening?

32:08.856 --> 32:10.490
That was a act of God.

32:12.493 --> 32:15.195
You and Chris were supposed
to control that game.

32:16.530 --> 32:18.164
And then you knelt for the anthem

32:18.199 --> 32:20.433
and got your dumb asses benched.

32:20.468 --> 32:23.803
And here we are.

32:23.838 --> 32:25.538
Is that why you took Chris out?

32:33.814 --> 32:35.348
I liked Chris.

32:37.151 --> 32:38.718
I didn't want it to go down
the way it did.

32:41.222 --> 32:42.822
I went to tell him he owed me money.

32:42.857 --> 32:46.593
He reached for my gun,
and it just went...

32:47.595 --> 32:49.529
Off.

32:49.563 --> 32:51.531
<i>You don't wanna be a fool like Chris.</i>

32:51.565 --> 32:53.232
All right, we got it.

32:53.257 --> 32:55.668
- Let's prepare to move in.
- Oh, Hank, hold on, hold on.

32:58.572 --> 33:00.407
<i>That's Woods' daughter.</i>

33:00.441 --> 33:02.208
<i>What is she doing here?</i>

33:05.780 --> 33:07.747
Antonio, we got a situation.

33:12.420 --> 33:16.556
Hey. Did you get my text?

33:16.590 --> 33:21.394
Hey, what you doing here, Brianna?

33:21.429 --> 33:22.862
I just came to meet Jamal for a drink.

33:22.897 --> 33:24.731
I didn't know he was with you.

33:24.765 --> 33:27.700
Brianna, hey. How you doing?

33:27.735 --> 33:29.536
Let's you and me get outta here.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.104
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who the hell are you?

33:31.138 --> 33:32.372
Yo, I got the confession! Arrest him!

33:32.406 --> 33:33.373
Hey, man! Hey, hey, hey!

33:33.407 --> 33:35.239
Hands! Hands!

33:35.443 --> 33:37.700
You're the damn police!

33:38.312 --> 33:40.447
<i>- Take it easy.
- Let's see some hands.</i>

33:40.481 --> 33:41.995
<i>- Put your hands up!
- All right.</i>

33:42.020 --> 33:43.883
- Put them up!
- Okay.

33:43.918 --> 33:45.418
On everything I love,
you better not move.

33:47.788 --> 33:49.456
Where'd they put the wire?

33:49.490 --> 33:50.890
Guys, it ain't like that, bro.

33:50.925 --> 33:53.526
Hey, man, where'd they put the wire?

33:58.632 --> 33:59.766
On the ground.

34:04.772 --> 34:06.139
Bro, Brianna ain't got nothing

34:06.173 --> 34:07.140
to do with this, brother...

34:08.309 --> 34:10.522
Hey, hey! Sit down!

34:10.844 --> 34:12.612
Don't move! In the chair!

34:14.315 --> 34:16.783
Nobody leaves. Nobody.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.406
I got word. Brianna?

34:34.451 --> 34:35.784
She's inside.

34:35.809 --> 34:37.047
How in the hell did that happen?

34:37.072 --> 34:39.587
- You tell me.
- Wrong time, wrong place.

34:39.603 --> 34:41.871
Denny, she knew exactly
what was going down,

34:41.906 --> 34:43.574
and she didn't get it from us.

34:46.177 --> 34:48.911
I told Brianna what was likely to happen

34:48.994 --> 34:50.462
after Jamal cooperated.

34:50.530 --> 34:52.831
Maybe he called her
and told her where he was.

34:52.866 --> 34:54.967
She came down here trying
to talk him out of it.

34:55.001 --> 34:56.502
She blew up our operation.

34:56.536 --> 34:58.004
Don't put it on her, Hank!

34:58.038 --> 34:59.506
That's not where I'm putting it.

35:02.209 --> 35:04.778
How do we get her out?

35:04.812 --> 35:06.413
I got Antonio inside.

35:16.524 --> 35:19.526
Seeing blue. This is bad, G.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.795
Hey, just chill, man.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.096
I got this.

35:23.130 --> 35:24.931
No, you don't got this.

35:24.965 --> 35:29.369
You know, I have told you
to shut up, man.

35:29.403 --> 35:31.371
Kendrick.

35:31.405 --> 35:33.139
You talk too much, man.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.841
Listen to me.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.376
You wanna live?

35:36.410 --> 35:37.977
Work with me.

35:38.012 --> 35:39.846
I'm your way out.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.815
There's a lot of white police
officers out there

35:41.849 --> 35:44.548
with itchy trigger fingers
waiting to shoot you.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.078
You won't make it 2 feet.

35:47.254 --> 35:50.056
Let me call my Sergeant.

35:50.090 --> 35:52.358
Talking's the best weapon
you got right now.

35:52.393 --> 35:53.893
No, no, no.

35:53.928 --> 35:55.995
- She's the best weapon I got.
- No!

35:56.030 --> 35:57.197
- Now.
- Brianna!

35:57.231 --> 35:58.498
- No!
- Denny.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.233
- I'm going in.
- No, you can't!

36:00.267 --> 36:02.035
Get the hell out of my way!
My daughter is in there!

36:02.069 --> 36:04.237
Denny, there's 15 people in there!

36:04.271 --> 36:06.339
You march in with a gun,
it's gonna be a bloodbath.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.507
Get your hands off me right now.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.075
- That's an order.
- Boss, boss...

36:09.109 --> 36:10.243
Look, we're not gonna just sit here!

36:10.277 --> 36:12.812
Denny! You've got to trust me!

36:12.847 --> 36:14.481
I've got a man inside!

36:14.515 --> 36:16.382
Just hold on.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.051
Talk to me, Antonio.

36:18.085 --> 36:19.552
<i>No, this ain't Antonio.</i>

36:19.587 --> 36:21.187
<i>This is Kendrick.</i>

36:21.222 --> 36:23.857
<i>And just so we're clear, I'm in charge.</i>

36:23.891 --> 36:27.227
<i>- You feel me?
- I feel you.</i>

36:27.261 --> 36:30.497
But it's my job to make sure
everybody in there stays alive.

36:30.531 --> 36:33.266
<i>You lay down your weapons,
this all ends peacefully.</i>

36:33.300 --> 36:35.001
Peace? That's dead.

36:35.035 --> 36:38.037
I got a cop, and I got
the daughter of a cop.

36:38.072 --> 36:39.439
I just want freedom.

36:39.473 --> 36:41.174
<i>Yeah? You release those hostages,</i>

36:41.208 --> 36:42.876
I can help you get it.

36:42.910 --> 36:43.877
<i>Help? I don't need your help.</i>

36:43.911 --> 36:45.078
<i>You need my help.</i>

36:45.112 --> 36:47.847
<i>You need my help to keep
these people alive.</i>

36:47.882 --> 36:49.015
I'm listening.

36:49.049 --> 36:51.017
Good.

36:51.051 --> 36:52.619
I want y'all to clear out.

36:52.653 --> 36:54.087
Miles away.

36:54.121 --> 36:55.955
And I want a car
with a full tank of gas.

36:57.658 --> 36:59.192
I can get that.

37:00.327 --> 37:01.861
But you and your friend gotta get

37:01.896 --> 37:03.229
in that car alone, Kendrick.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.031
That's the only way this thing works.

37:06.467 --> 37:07.634
<i>You feel me?</i>

37:09.570 --> 37:10.603
Whatever, man.

37:10.638 --> 37:11.971
Just get me the car.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.407
All right, you heard him.

37:15.976 --> 37:17.477
Look, it's your daughter in there.

37:17.511 --> 37:18.645
I'll do whatever you want.

37:18.679 --> 37:20.046
We can move in right now.

37:26.687 --> 37:28.221
Get him the car.

37:35.996 --> 37:37.063
Hang tight.

37:37.097 --> 37:38.298
It's almost over.

37:38.332 --> 37:39.566
You all right?

37:39.600 --> 37:42.168
I'm good.

37:42.202 --> 37:44.404
Baby...

37:44.438 --> 37:48.007
I am so sorry for bringing you
into all of this.

37:48.042 --> 37:50.443
- I'm sorry for everything.
- No, it's my fault.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.011
I didn't know Kendrick would be here.

37:53.714 --> 37:56.182
Hey, hey, you're coming with.

37:56.216 --> 37:57.951
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

37:57.985 --> 38:00.453
Hey! One more word, Mally Mal.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.322
One more word.

38:02.356 --> 38:04.157
You're a damn fool, you know that?

38:04.191 --> 38:06.426
We had something special, man.

38:06.460 --> 38:08.161
I took care of you.

38:08.195 --> 38:09.329
- You took care of yourself.
- Let's go.

38:09.363 --> 38:11.097
No way they agreed to this.

38:11.131 --> 38:12.365
Hey, I ain't going out there
without protection.

38:12.399 --> 38:13.533
So let's go, and shut up.

38:13.567 --> 38:15.101
Matter of fact,

38:15.135 --> 38:17.203
Mal, get your goof ass in the bathroom.

38:17.237 --> 38:19.973
Everybody in the bathroom right now!

38:20.007 --> 38:22.542
Y'all wanna get hit?
Get in the bathroom right now!

38:22.576 --> 38:24.043
Look at me. Don't try to run.

38:24.078 --> 38:25.478
Stay perfectly still. You hear me?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.280
Don't try to run.

38:27.314 --> 38:28.281
Open the door.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.484
Come on, let's go. Open the door.

38:42.663 --> 38:44.998
Relax. Slow.

38:46.767 --> 38:49.202
You cannot let her get into that car.

38:49.236 --> 38:50.536
I won't.

38:52.239 --> 38:54.540
Talk to me, Jay.

38:54.575 --> 38:56.075
No shot, Sarge.

38:59.113 --> 39:01.381
- Stop moving.
- Dad, are you there?

39:01.415 --> 39:03.683
Brianna, just stay calm.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.351
Do what they say.

39:11.358 --> 39:13.092
No!

39:13.127 --> 39:14.727
Brianna!

39:35.149 --> 39:36.683
Hey. Hey, baby.

39:40.554 --> 39:42.188
Get a squad car!

39:42.222 --> 39:44.223
We gotta get her to the
hospital right away now!

39:44.258 --> 39:45.591
Copy that.

39:45.626 --> 39:47.260
Come on, baby. Just stay with me.

39:48.562 --> 39:50.129
Come on, baby. Come on.

39:50.164 --> 39:52.065
We got you. Come on.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.399
Come on. Come on.

39:53.434 --> 39:56.569
Come on, that's my girl. That's my girl.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.238
That's my girl. Yes.

40:12.319 --> 40:13.519
How's Brianna?

40:17.191 --> 40:18.658
I wanna see her.

40:18.692 --> 40:20.827
Go home, son.

40:20.861 --> 40:22.395
What you mean?

40:22.429 --> 40:25.231
It means you're not going to see her.

40:25.265 --> 40:27.266
- I'm her boyfriend.
- No, you're not.

40:27.301 --> 40:29.102
I said go home.

40:32.106 --> 40:34.107
Officer, this man is causing
a disturbance.

40:34.141 --> 40:35.641
Hell, no. You can't do that, man.

40:35.676 --> 40:37.276
Remove him.

40:37.311 --> 40:38.444
- What... I just...
- Come on.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.313
- Let's go.
- Yeah?

40:40.347 --> 40:42.081
Hey, hey, let's go!

40:42.116 --> 40:43.516
You can't... bro, stop shoving me.

40:43.550 --> 40:45.451
Let's go!

40:49.823 --> 40:50.823
How is she?

40:55.329 --> 40:56.796
She's not good, Hank.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.165
She's dying.

41:01.668 --> 41:02.869
I'm so sorry, Denny.

41:05.539 --> 41:07.340
We did everything we could.

41:09.176 --> 41:10.810
Yeah.

41:10.844 --> 41:13.479
Well...

41:13.514 --> 41:15.281
It wasn't good enough.
