00:11.729 --> 00:15.722
(playful instrumental music)

00:15.723 --> 00:19.640
(speaking in foreign language)

00:27.178 --> 00:28.261
Cinderella.

00:31.752 --> 00:35.502
(playful instrumental music)

00:36.907 --> 00:38.490
I want in, someone.

00:39.601 --> 00:42.572
Hurry, just get that milkman
and jerk off that goat.

00:42.573 --> 00:43.733
Get me some fresh milk.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.705
Yesterday, milk was curdled.

00:46.706 --> 00:50.873
If the lady of Avon comes,
get me one of everything.

00:52.124 --> 00:54.236
I you get another wash,
you can have the water

00:54.237 --> 00:55.070
to wash your hair.

00:55.071 --> 00:57.348
You know there's a water shortage.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.995
And then you'll take in more
laundry from the neighbors.

00:59.996 --> 01:01.496
We need the money.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.566
Don't make you another
wig of your sister's.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.067
Keep working, work keep
your mind off sex.

01:19.056 --> 01:20.056
Oh look.

01:21.239 --> 01:23.600
This baby is daydreaming again.

01:23.601 --> 01:25.713
I wonder what about.

01:25.714 --> 01:30.127
Probably about all kinds of
dirty and degenerate dogs.

01:30.128 --> 01:30.961
(laughing)

01:30.962 --> 01:32.588
Dingling and dangling about her.

01:32.589 --> 01:35.514
She mopes through her dreary day.

01:35.515 --> 01:37.047
I think it's naughty.

01:37.048 --> 01:39.345
I should say, if you
didn't if you ask me,

01:39.346 --> 01:43.177
which I know you're about to do.
(laughing)

01:43.178 --> 01:45.684
Shirking her little duties again.

01:45.685 --> 01:46.768
Disgrace all.

01:48.634 --> 01:50.384
Marbella, Marbella.

01:51.374 --> 01:53.509
Give it a little two.

01:53.510 --> 01:54.531
(sniffing)

01:54.532 --> 01:56.064
(hoots)

01:56.065 --> 01:58.525
Do you know, that a
not so little birdie

01:58.526 --> 02:00.366
told me that it was none
other than little ass.

02:00.393 --> 02:02.635
Rella over there that told
mama we go out at night.

02:02.636 --> 02:04.794
I never did any such thing.

02:04.795 --> 02:07.418
I wouldn't, believe me.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.485
I did no such thing.

02:08.487 --> 02:09.531
I wouldn't, believe me.

02:09.532 --> 02:10.553
I did no such thing.

02:10.554 --> 02:11.830
I wouldn't, believe me.

02:11.831 --> 02:12.664
(shushing)

02:12.665 --> 02:14.590
Really, Cinderella,
you are such a bore.

02:14.591 --> 02:18.630
You always force us to behave
so unpleasantly to you.

02:18.631 --> 02:21.092
I think that even a
tour most unpleasant,

02:21.093 --> 02:23.739
we're not at all that
unpleasant, actually.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.039
Are we?

02:25.040 --> 02:26.479
(clacking)

02:26.480 --> 02:29.614
Are we Cinderella? (Laughing)

02:29.615 --> 02:30.615
Well, I...

02:33.306 --> 02:34.536
Talk.

02:34.537 --> 02:35.767
You think like a snail.

02:35.768 --> 02:37.276
Honestly, why don't
you go old and die

02:37.277 --> 02:39.110
before you would answer a
perfectly simple question.

02:39.111 --> 02:41.431
Or was the question, never mind,
whatever she would answer

02:41.458 --> 02:42.268
would be a bore.

02:42.269 --> 02:43.778
Drucella, dear.

02:43.779 --> 02:46.285
We mustn't forget about
Cinderella's indiscretion tip.

02:46.286 --> 02:48.863
Mama, it was unforgivably naughty.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.138
She must be punished, mustn't she?

02:51.139 --> 02:52.880
Of course.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.806
How else will she ever learn?

02:55.807 --> 02:56.807
Let's see.

02:57.502 --> 03:00.217
She can wash our dresses.

03:00.218 --> 03:02.218
And they must be perfectly
pressed, do you hear?

03:02.245 --> 03:06.831
Perfectly pressed.

03:09.971 --> 03:13.721
(playful instrumental music)

03:16.217 --> 03:19.351
♫ Cinderella, sweep the
ashes from the fireplace

03:19.352 --> 03:22.601
♫ Cinderella, wash and
scrub up the entire place

03:22.602 --> 03:26.095
♫ Cinderella, polish
every little widget

03:26.096 --> 03:29.532
♫ Sit up straight girl, don't
you fuss and don't you fidget

03:29.533 --> 03:32.690
♫ And I wonder if I
have to face this scorn

03:32.691 --> 03:36.858
♫ Yes, I wonder just
why I was ever born

03:41.932 --> 03:46.099
♫ Times when I want to
cry, I spy a rainbow

03:47.227 --> 03:51.394
♫ When life is gray, the
flowers start to bloom

03:52.823 --> 03:56.990
♫ Or when a chilling wind
begins the rain flow

03:58.233 --> 04:00.740
♫ I take a moment to remind me

04:00.741 --> 04:03.294
♫ Someone will come
along and find me

04:03.295 --> 04:07.462
♫ Suddenly I can
smile away the gloom

04:12.560 --> 04:15.391
♫ Cinderella, braid my
hair and just for kickers

04:15.392 --> 04:18.665
♫ Cinderella, darn my
hose and iron my knickers

04:18.666 --> 04:22.148
♫ Cinderella, you're a
good-for-nothing wretch, girl

04:22.149 --> 04:24.052
♫ Where's my girdle

04:24.053 --> 04:25.653
♫ Goodness sake's, go
run and fetch girl

04:25.680 --> 04:28.604
♫ And I wonder, is
this all I'll ever be

04:28.605 --> 04:32.772
♫ Yes, I wonder, is there
nothing more to see

04:38.078 --> 04:42.245
♫ When I am cold, the
morning sun will warm me

04:43.396 --> 04:47.563
♫ When I am sad, the
birds begin my song

04:48.759 --> 04:52.926
♫ And when, at times, my
life begins to scorn me

04:54.448 --> 04:56.932
♫ I take a moment to remind me

04:56.933 --> 04:59.184
♫ Someday he'll come
along and find me

04:59.185 --> 05:03.352
♫ And the time goes
by and I am strong

05:05.339 --> 05:09.506
♫ Sometimes I think in a
wink of an eye it'll happen

05:11.097 --> 05:15.264
♫ Life rearranges and
changes tomorrow's tune

05:16.507 --> 05:20.674
♫ But just when I'm caught Ina
thought, I remember tomorrow

05:21.941 --> 05:26.108
♫ And just like today, it
will be on its way too soon

05:27.653 --> 05:31.820
♫ So I can't be down too
long or stay too lonely

05:33.086 --> 05:37.253
♫ For nothing can be
as awful as it seems

05:39.031 --> 05:43.743
♫ When things go wrong,
I know that I have only

05:43.744 --> 05:46.762
♫ To take a moment to remind me

05:46.763 --> 05:49.455
♫ Someone will come
along and find me

05:49.456 --> 05:53.623
♫ And we'll be forever
inside my dreams

05:58.350 --> 06:00.600
(whirring)

06:11.221 --> 06:13.635
[Stepsisters] Just a
second, we're going.

06:13.636 --> 06:15.886
(whirring)

06:34.836 --> 06:36.182
[Stepsister] Faster
Cinderella, faster.

06:36.183 --> 06:37.181
[Stepsister] No,
slower, Cinderella.

06:37.181 --> 06:38.180
[Stepsister] Faster.

06:38.181 --> 06:39.224
[Stepsister] Slower.

06:39.225 --> 06:40.058
[Stepsister] Faster.

06:40.058 --> 06:40.891
[Stepsister] Slow.

06:40.892 --> 06:43.058
(screams)

06:45.488 --> 06:49.156
(trumpets blaring)

06:49.157 --> 06:51.240
(groans)

06:57.864 --> 07:01.416
Oh boy, oh boy. (Laughing)

07:01.417 --> 07:03.320
Chamberlain, Chamberlain.

07:03.321 --> 07:04.829
Come here at once.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.801
(laughing)

07:07.802 --> 07:08.916
(thuds)

07:08.917 --> 07:10.170
(groans)

07:10.171 --> 07:11.882
Yes, my liege.

07:11.883 --> 07:14.808
(laughing)

07:14.809 --> 07:16.062
(moans)

07:16.063 --> 07:16.991
It's a whopper.

07:16.992 --> 07:18.569
I will summon the
queen immediately.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.520
No, you fool.

07:20.521 --> 07:22.192
Fetch me my baggy pants.

07:22.193 --> 07:26.302
I'm taking this one into town.
(laughing)

07:26.303 --> 07:29.436
[Chamberlain] Too late, my lord.

07:29.437 --> 07:31.687
(whistles)

07:36.984 --> 07:40.210
Good morning, your majesty.

07:40.211 --> 07:41.210
Good morning.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.185
Chamberlain, leave us.

07:42.186 --> 07:45.185
We have private
business to discuss.

07:48.896 --> 07:49.896
Clod.

07:51.194 --> 07:53.701
What is it you want, your highness.

07:53.702 --> 07:57.869
Your highness indeed, you
horny little jack off.

07:58.950 --> 08:01.828
But what do you want, my queen?

08:01.829 --> 08:05.961
Next month, our son will
reach his 21st birthday.

08:05.962 --> 08:09.467
Well this calls for a double
celebration, I would say.

08:09.468 --> 08:10.837
[King] A double celebration?

08:10.838 --> 08:13.183
21 years ago was the
last time you had

08:13.184 --> 08:14.351
a royal boner.

08:15.413 --> 08:17.757
Really? (Laughing)

08:17.758 --> 08:19.661
If you had been in here
a few minutes ago,

08:19.662 --> 08:23.829
you wouldn't be so quick
to judge me. (Laughing)

08:25.093 --> 08:27.985
But I'm not talking
about pierced hard on.

08:27.986 --> 08:29.546
Oh, oh, don't hurt
me, don't hurt me.

08:29.573 --> 08:31.305
Consider this pleasure.

08:31.306 --> 08:32.395
(grunts)

08:32.397 --> 08:33.999
Let's get down to business.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.645
Now I don't mind preparing the ball

08:36.647 --> 08:40.523
but one thing I will not
do, and I don't know

08:40.524 --> 08:44.030
how capable you are,
and that is tell him

08:44.030 --> 08:45.678
the facts of life.

08:45.679 --> 08:49.262
The boy knows absolutely
nothing about sex.

08:55.153 --> 08:57.570
(trumpeting)

09:01.051 --> 09:03.301
(laughing)

09:04.859 --> 09:08.526
(gentle instrumental music)

09:12.777 --> 09:15.911
♫ There was a time when
my scepter would climb

09:15.912 --> 09:19.997
♫ Whene's a sweet lass came my way

09:19.998 --> 09:23.782
♫ If the damsel was built,
the tilt of my kilt

09:23.783 --> 09:28.217
♫ Was a bold invitation to play

09:28.218 --> 09:32.234
♫ But now the thrill's
faded, his highness is jaded

09:32.235 --> 09:36.182
♫ I'm rather a sad, royal bloke

09:36.183 --> 09:40.292
♫ Girls plead for the
chance to fondle my lance

09:40.293 --> 09:44.402
♫ And I just fall
asleep in mid-stroke

09:44.403 --> 09:48.651
♫ With many of them,
I have tried S and M

09:48.652 --> 09:53.063
♫ But I get no kick from the pain

09:53.064 --> 09:56.430
♫ And though you may think
I'm not one for a kink

09:56.431 --> 10:00.539
♫ I once made it with a Great Dane

10:00.540 --> 10:04.533
♫ I can't raise a bulge in my tunic

10:04.534 --> 10:08.457
♫ Per chance I'm becoming a eunuch

10:08.458 --> 10:12.475
♫ Or am I headed
straight for the day

10:12.476 --> 10:16.422
♫ When I'm blissfully
happy and gay?

10:16.423 --> 10:20.067
♫ I've known more delights
than King Arthur has knights

10:20.068 --> 10:24.549
♫ My sex life is legend to some

10:24.550 --> 10:28.450
♫ But I've lost my touch
and I dread it very much

10:28.451 --> 10:32.618
♫ The day when my
kingdom won't come

10:33.954 --> 10:37.715
♫ Kingdom won't come

10:37.716 --> 10:41.035
♫ My kingdom won't come

10:41.036 --> 10:44.953
♫ Can't get my kingdom to come

10:46.098 --> 10:48.265
(moaning)

10:53.245 --> 10:54.845
I don't care if the
prince can't come.

10:54.846 --> 10:57.492
My pee-pee's getting very hard.
(laughing)

10:57.493 --> 10:59.558
(blowing)

10:59.559 --> 11:01.799
[Woman] Hi majesty the kind
and her highness the queen

11:01.826 --> 11:03.297
proclaim a great ball.

11:03.298 --> 11:04.131
(gasps)

11:04.132 --> 11:06.641
In honor of the
birthday of the prince

11:06.642 --> 11:07.709
who will choose a bride.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.963
A bride.

11:08.964 --> 11:10.884
[Woman] From all the
fair maidens of the land.

11:10.911 --> 11:12.546
(shrieks)

11:12.547 --> 11:15.009
We gotta get ready for the ball.

11:15.010 --> 11:17.260
Forget it, you're pregnant.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.011
(minstrel music)

11:29.939 --> 11:32.106
(moaning)

13:16.865 --> 13:18.782
Is your father about?

13:19.767 --> 13:21.926
My business is with him.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.039
He's out setting
beaver traps, my lord.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.827
Beaver traps?

13:25.828 --> 13:28.149
There's no beaver in this
part of the country.

13:28.150 --> 13:31.317
What do you call
this then, my lord?

13:32.236 --> 13:33.236
The fern.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.184
A bush?

13:35.185 --> 13:36.206
[Chamberlain] A bush?

13:36.207 --> 13:37.437
A beaver, my lord.

13:37.438 --> 13:38.853
Beaver?

13:38.854 --> 13:40.437
Fern, bush, beaver?

13:41.315 --> 13:42.898
Bush, beaver, fern.

13:48.142 --> 13:51.786
Then put your beaver
next to her bush.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.037
Yes, my lord.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.868
Now that's a fern.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.025
Ere here, ere here, my lord.

14:03.026 --> 14:04.697
What are you doing?

14:04.698 --> 14:07.065
With me two lovely birds.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.992
Birds, birds, birds. (Stuttering)

14:08.993 --> 14:10.896
It was a hot and long
journey, I thirst,

14:10.897 --> 14:13.567
I stop for a pot of water.

14:13.568 --> 14:15.901
(splashing)

14:22.299 --> 14:23.382
For you, sir.

14:24.481 --> 14:27.847
Invitations from his royal
highness the prince,

14:27.848 --> 14:29.821
inviting your daughters
to the great ball

14:29.822 --> 14:31.632
in honor of his birthday.

14:31.633 --> 14:34.929
(playful instrumental music)

14:34.930 --> 14:36.113
The prince is born.

14:36.114 --> 14:37.762
The prince is born,
my little birds.

14:37.763 --> 14:40.002
(screaming)

14:40.003 --> 14:42.689
Oh, we broke the balls, eh, now.

14:42.690 --> 14:44.773
(groans)

14:47.195 --> 14:48.889
[Drucella] (moans)
You're so gorgeous,

14:48.890 --> 14:50.557
you drive me insane.

14:51.746 --> 14:55.913
And you, my lovely, I could
eat you up, you're so scrummy.

14:58.387 --> 14:59.965
I must come closer.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.196
Closer, yes.

It's true.

15:15.686 --> 15:17.009

a prisoner of love

My lord.

Fetch your father.

17:30.292 --> 17:32.311
My business is with him.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.937
He's out chopping wood.

17:33.938 --> 17:36.003
For the hearth, my lord.

17:36.004 --> 17:37.187
Hearth.

17:37.188 --> 17:38.688
Hearth, my lord.

17:40.834 --> 17:41.834
Very well.

And fetch me an apple.

Anything wrong, my lord?

Have you binding?

19:42.387 --> 19:44.470
(crying)

19:48.239 --> 19:50.699
Isn't he paying
taxes, is that it?

19:50.700 --> 19:53.950
Oh please, please
don't harm my father.

19:55.437 --> 19:57.015
He's a good man.

19:57.016 --> 20:00.289
And our mother died,
he's all we've got.

20:00.290 --> 20:03.145
At least kill us when
our father is done.

20:03.146 --> 20:05.229

24:16.790 --> 24:20.388
I shan't wait for
your father any longer.

24:20.389 --> 24:23.056
When he returns, give him these.

24:25.311 --> 24:26.889
What are they?

24:26.890 --> 24:27.890
Read them.

24:28.748 --> 24:30.748
(thuds)

24:37.455 --> 24:41.054
His royal highness the
prince has the honor to invite

your daughter to the
great ball he is giving

24:44.096 --> 24:46.013
on the 13th day before.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.294
Why that pompous.

Poop.

Whoa, Glump, whoa.

25:01.349 --> 25:03.599

Hey, Glump, you're the
best trained horse

25:06.666 --> 25:07.916
in the kingdom.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.806
(knocks)

25:17.835 --> 25:19.752
Oh, Lord Chamberlain.

25:21.179 --> 25:23.267
What a pleasant surprise.

25:31.698 --> 25:32.857
I think not, madame.

25:32.858 --> 25:37.025
Oh, do, do, do come in.
(laughing)

25:42.996 --> 25:44.246
Do, do come in.

25:45.574 --> 25:47.824

25:54.142 --> 25:57.725
My god, three flew
over the cuckoos nest.

26:11.859 --> 26:15.341
With your kind permission,
madame, may I present

26:15.342 --> 26:18.342
these invitations
to your daughters.

26:40.442 --> 26:42.972
And pretty girl, what
might your name be?

26:42.973 --> 26:44.973
My name is Cinderella.

26:46.038 --> 26:49.038
She deaf. (Moans)

26:50.543 --> 26:54.071
We cannot wait, my Lord, we
cannot thank you enough.

26:54.072 --> 26:58.239
This would be the biggest
ball of them all. (Laughing)

26:59.645 --> 27:01.228
You have no idea.

27:02.594 --> 27:06.011
(laughing) Do, do, do.

27:11.950 --> 27:12.950
(cracking)

27:12.951 --> 27:14.482
Tell us.

27:14.483 --> 27:16.900

27:20.915 --> 27:24.248
♫ His majesty, the king

27:25.303 --> 27:27.624
♫ Is going to do his thing

27:43.531 --> 27:47.059
♫ Will really dig this scene

27:47.060 --> 27:50.658
♫ She's anxious for a royal ball

27:50.659 --> 27:52.563
♫ It's been so many months, you see

27:52.564 --> 27:54.095
♫ It happened only once, you see

27:54.096 --> 27:58.263
♫ She wants it to
be large, not small

27:59.646 --> 28:01.386
♫ The kingdom will be festive

28:01.387 --> 28:03.592
♫ With wine flowing everywhere

28:03.593 --> 28:06.611
♫ And feasting all around

28:06.612 --> 28:08.886
♫ There'll be many a buxom maiden

28:08.887 --> 28:10.047
♫ And many a handsome lad

28:10.048 --> 28:13.344
♫ And frolicking will abound

28:13.345 --> 28:17.007
♫ His majesty, the prince

28:17.008 --> 28:20.374
♫ This part of it makes me wince

28:20.375 --> 28:23.996
♫ Will announce in
front of one and all

28:23.997 --> 28:25.970
♫ He's looking for
someone great to be

28:25.971 --> 28:27.619

28:38.835 --> 28:41.713
(clacking)

28:41.714 --> 28:45.428
(gasps) I'm gonna wear
my gigantic steeple hat

28:45.429 --> 28:46.775
with the big wings.

28:46.776 --> 28:50.722
And I'm gonna wear my ruby
breast flattering. (Laughing)

28:50.723 --> 28:53.556
I'm gonna wear my blue and gold.

28:57.550 --> 28:58.780
Glump.

28:58.781 --> 29:00.531
What should I wear?

29:01.544 --> 29:05.294
(playful instrumental music)

29:18.634 --> 29:21.907
Yes, Cinderella does
need something to wear

29:21.908 --> 29:23.486
to the ball.

29:23.487 --> 29:27.070
But first, of course,
she must be washed.

29:39.926 --> 29:40.926
Glump.

29:47.635 --> 29:48.635
Oh look.

29:49.772 --> 29:51.189
Here's some soap.

29:52.697 --> 29:54.177
[Marbella] That's
not soap, that's.

29:54.204 --> 29:55.204
Yes.

30:03.611 --> 30:05.944
Lovely fragrant bath powder.

30:11.204 --> 30:13.287
Berry juice for her lips.

30:16.544 --> 30:18.794
Ooh, coming along nicely.

30:20.445 --> 30:23.278
[Drucella] Now jewels for tiara.

30:29.803 --> 30:30.803
Oh shit.

30:47.798 --> 30:49.376
Cinderella, it's gorgeous.

30:49.377 --> 30:50.561
Stunning.

30:50.562 --> 30:51.884
It's you.

30:51.885 --> 30:53.218
It's really you.

30:57.179 --> 31:00.754
Cinderella, will you stop
wasting your sisters' time.

31:00.755 --> 31:02.867
They must get ready for the ball.

31:02.868 --> 31:05.282
You should be helping them,
not distracting them.

31:05.283 --> 31:06.700
Ungrateful child.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.243
Glump.

31:15.244 --> 31:19.077
Bitch leg, I promise you
I won't sing anymore.

31:20.933 --> 31:22.183
Give me that.

31:24.695 --> 31:26.862
It's getting cold in here.

31:47.729 --> 31:51.896
[Drucella] We should have
been Charlie's Angels.

31:56.390 --> 31:58.550
[Stepmother] Cinderella,
we're off to the ball.

31:58.551 --> 32:02.718
But please do wait for us.
(laughing)

32:09.929 --> 32:13.596

(suspenseful music)

34:54.170 --> 34:56.338
(popping)

35:07.099 --> 35:08.859
[Man] Thief, he robbed
the old (mumbling).

35:08.886 --> 35:10.581
[Man] Thief, thief, thief.

35:10.582 --> 35:13.785
He robbed my sister, thief, thief.

35:13.786 --> 35:15.828
(screaming)

35:15.829 --> 35:17.616
Thief, over there, over there.

35:17.617 --> 35:18.940
Stop, get him.

35:18.941 --> 35:20.380
Thief.

35:20.381 --> 35:23.050
[Man] Thief, thief, thief.

35:23.051 --> 35:24.861
[Man] He robbed my grandmother.

35:24.862 --> 35:25.862
Thief.

35:27.347 --> 35:29.180
Police, police, thief.

35:35.891 --> 35:37.005
[Cinderella] Who are you?

35:37.006 --> 35:38.006
Who am I?

35:40.466 --> 35:41.466
Who are you?

35:43.066 --> 35:45.620
Well, I'm Cinderella.

35:45.621 --> 35:49.788
Oh, if you're Cinderella,
I'm your fairy godmother.

35:52.099 --> 35:54.048
You're my fairy godmother?

35:54.049 --> 35:55.767
[Godmother] Sure am.

35:55.768 --> 35:57.880
But where's your wings?

35:57.881 --> 35:58.881
Wings?

35:59.762 --> 36:03.894
Oh, my wings were clipped
a long time ago.

36:03.895 --> 36:04.895
Oh.

36:05.868 --> 36:09.675
But isn't a fairy godmother
supposed to be a woman?

36:09.676 --> 36:12.648
Child that didn't even
know what fairy means.

36:12.649 --> 36:15.457
Well a fairy can go
both ways, mama.

36:15.458 --> 36:18.958
Oh, well I'm glad to
see you, of course,

36:19.864 --> 36:24.205
but you're not at all like
they described you to me.

36:24.206 --> 36:25.923
When I was little, I mean.

36:25.924 --> 36:29.674
I was told that my fairy
godmother was, well,

36:30.568 --> 36:31.651
fair skinned.

36:33.007 --> 36:36.790
Well, you know my
sweet, of fairies,

36:36.791 --> 36:38.555
we follow the seasons.

36:38.556 --> 36:41.829
I just came from a long
vacation in an island

36:41.830 --> 36:43.246
and in the sun all day long.

36:43.247 --> 36:45.568
That's why I'm a little
on the dark side.

36:45.569 --> 36:47.636
You know what I mean?

36:47.637 --> 36:49.720
But let's talk about you.

36:50.688 --> 36:53.311
How's my little godchild doing?

36:53.312 --> 36:56.062
Not very well, fairy godmother.

36:59.581 --> 37:01.693
You've been crying.

37:01.694 --> 37:04.317
What's the matter, huh?

37:04.318 --> 37:06.593
My stepmother and
stepsisters have been very

37:06.594 --> 37:07.870
mean to me lately.

37:07.871 --> 37:09.797
Tonight's the great ball
at the palace and...

37:09.798 --> 37:12.467
I know.

37:12.468 --> 37:14.650
The Lord Chamberlain
invited me himself,

37:14.651 --> 37:17.390
but my stepmother threw it
in the fire and it burned.

37:17.391 --> 37:22.147
That's stepmother of
yours, she's a real mother.

37:22.148 --> 37:23.656
No, she's my stepmother.

37:23.657 --> 37:25.457
You see, my father
remarried before he died...

37:25.484 --> 37:28.277
No no no no no no, cool it mama.
(laughing)

37:28.278 --> 37:29.809
Lay your story on me.

37:29.810 --> 37:33.362
Why won't they let you
go to the ball, huh?

37:33.363 --> 37:35.545
I am too dirty and ugly.

37:35.546 --> 37:39.144
Well, why, I meant you do
have a little crud on you.

37:39.145 --> 37:40.145
Yes sir.

37:40.863 --> 37:42.882
But I know, that's enough bad.

37:42.883 --> 37:43.883
Well, here.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.085
Oh, thank you.

37:47.086 --> 37:49.918
Besides, I couldn't go
in these rags, anyway.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.031
(laughing)

37:52.032 --> 37:54.283
Never mind the rags, mama.

37:54.284 --> 37:57.604
And about that ugly
face, you got something

37:57.605 --> 37:59.856
nobody at the ball has got.

37:59.857 --> 38:03.037
You got tits and ass. (Laughing)

38:03.038 --> 38:05.591
Yeah, you can go to the ball naked,

38:05.592 --> 38:09.655
and make them all look like frogs.
(laughing)

38:09.656 --> 38:11.350
Anyway, loosen up now.

38:11.351 --> 38:12.929
We got to do something about that.

38:12.930 --> 38:15.297
Yeah, mama, and you're
still going to the ball.

38:15.298 --> 38:16.853
I'll handle that.

38:16.854 --> 38:17.944
(laughing)

38:17.945 --> 38:20.195
(mumbling)

38:21.568 --> 38:23.808
(laughing) Do you have a little
something to drink, huh,

38:23.835 --> 38:24.562
do you?

38:24.563 --> 38:26.163
[Cinderella] We have
some goat's milk.

38:26.190 --> 38:26.907
Goat's milk.

38:26.908 --> 38:27.975
Are you a fool?

38:27.976 --> 38:28.809
It means that mother
got a little something

38:28.809 --> 38:29.642
in the medicine cabinet, huh.

38:29.643 --> 38:30.802
Which is?

38:30.803 --> 38:31.802
I never heard of that...

38:31.803 --> 38:33.798
How about some smoke, dear?

38:33.799 --> 38:35.469
(mumbling)

38:35.470 --> 38:36.537
The yard's full in back.

38:36.538 --> 38:39.288
No, honey, I mean, Flugel weed.

38:40.857 --> 38:42.296
You sure do talk funny.

38:42.297 --> 38:43.643
What weed?

38:43.644 --> 38:45.059
Are you going on up?

38:45.060 --> 38:50.005
Take a bath and leave the
rest to your fairy godmother.

38:50.006 --> 38:52.256
(babbling)

38:54.070 --> 38:57.737
(upbeat instrumental music)

39:01.128 --> 39:02.614
♫ I have looted half the kingdom

39:02.615 --> 39:06.782
♫ And I've stolen everything
from art to zebras

39:07.932 --> 39:09.132
♫ They were very little zebras

39:09.159 --> 39:10.508
♫ Proving I'm not prejudiced

39:10.509 --> 39:14.224
♫ I've ripped off
Saggitarians and Libras

39:14.225 --> 39:16.128
♫ The Libras owned the zebras

39:16.129 --> 39:19.634
♫ If you can't keep
up with the prices

39:19.635 --> 39:23.024
♫ I'll tell you what
this fairy's advice is

39:23.025 --> 39:25.230
♫ You got to grab it

39:25.231 --> 39:26.553
♫ And fence it while you can

39:26.554 --> 39:28.806
♫ It's a livin'

39:28.807 --> 39:30.245
♫ So stick it to the man

39:30.246 --> 39:32.219
♫ Gotta grab it

39:32.220 --> 39:33.705
♫ If bread is what you lack

39:33.706 --> 39:36.073
♫ It's called a livin'

39:36.074 --> 39:39.092
♫ So slip it in your pack

39:39.093 --> 39:42.343
♫ Won't my family be surprised

39:42.344 --> 39:46.035
♫ When I make my debut

39:46.036 --> 39:50.029
♫ They just won't
believe their eyes

39:50.030 --> 39:53.512
♫ And I'm sure they'll say too

39:53.513 --> 39:55.502
♫ Shove it in your Gucci sack

39:55.503 --> 39:58.753
♫ And load it on the
back of both your zebras

39:58.754 --> 40:00.889
♫ I couldn't fence the zebras

40:00.890 --> 40:02.724
♫ My stash of ladies underwear

40:02.725 --> 40:06.416
♫ Has even got a pair
of double D bras

40:06.417 --> 40:08.413
♫ I put them on the zebras

40:08.414 --> 40:11.872
♫ At every other
trade, I'm inept, so

40:11.873 --> 40:15.588
♫ I guess I'll spend
my days as a klepto

40:15.589 --> 40:17.608
♫ I'm gonna grab it

40:17.609 --> 40:19.569
♫ And fence it while I
can, because it's a living

40:19.596 --> 40:22.347
♫ You got to stick it to the man

40:22.348 --> 40:24.738
♫ So better grab it

40:24.739 --> 40:26.085
♫ If bread is what you lack

40:26.086 --> 40:28.035
♫ It's called a livin'

40:28.036 --> 40:31.077
♫ So I slip it in my pack

40:31.078 --> 40:34.792
♫ With a fairy for a friend

40:34.793 --> 40:38.415
♫ I've no worries since he'll

40:38.416 --> 40:42.466
♫ See that there's a happy end

40:42.467 --> 40:46.042
♫ And I know the prince will

40:46.043 --> 40:49.269
♫ Grab it and put it in your sack

40:49.270 --> 40:50.825
♫ Livin'

40:50.826 --> 40:52.659
♫ Uh-huh

40:52.660 --> 40:55.910
♫ Grab it and put it in your sack

40:55.911 --> 40:57.954
♫ Livin'

40:57.955 --> 40:59.927
♫ Uh-huh

40:59.928 --> 41:03.085
♫ Grab it and put it in your sack

41:03.086 --> 41:05.175
♫ Livin'

41:05.176 --> 41:07.311
♫ Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

41:07.312 --> 41:09.751
♫ Grab it and put it in the sack

41:09.752 --> 41:12.212
♫ Livin'

41:12.213 --> 41:15.068
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh

41:15.069 --> 41:18.303
♫ Grab it Oh my, look.

41:24.172 --> 41:26.843
Remember I said tits and ass.
(laughing)

41:26.844 --> 41:29.511
You got a face to with it, yeah.

41:30.512 --> 41:31.845
But now, what?

41:34.547 --> 41:35.547
Now what?

41:36.427 --> 41:39.747
Ah, I'll tell you what. (Laughing)

41:39.748 --> 41:41.512
What good will a fairy
godmother be if he

41:41.513 --> 41:43.671
couldn't help his godchild.
(laughing)

41:43.672 --> 41:47.270
Let him go on and see
what's in his bag.

41:47.271 --> 41:50.188
We're gonna do something about you.

42:03.850 --> 42:04.987
(sniffs)

42:04.988 --> 42:06.891
(grunts)

42:06.892 --> 42:09.475
Yeah, I'll save this for later.

42:14.601 --> 42:16.620
I don't know what the hell it is,

42:16.621 --> 42:18.942
I'll save it for my
next garage sale.

42:18.943 --> 42:21.526
Those people will buy anything.

42:27.442 --> 42:29.368
Oh is that your magic wand?

42:29.369 --> 42:30.369
My what?

42:32.596 --> 42:34.096
Oh, oh, of course.

42:34.942 --> 42:36.496
That's what it is.

42:36.497 --> 42:37.866
Let's see now.

42:37.867 --> 42:39.933
Which wand is this?

42:39.934 --> 42:42.835
I have several, you know.

42:42.836 --> 42:45.645
Could you, could you read this?

42:45.646 --> 42:48.385
My eyes are a little
bad in the dark.

42:48.386 --> 42:53.076
This wand can perform
miracles for good causes only.

42:53.077 --> 42:57.077
Caution, all miracles null
and void at midnight.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.668
Keep out of reach of children.

43:00.669 --> 43:02.874
Does it really work?

43:02.875 --> 43:05.127
That's what it says.

43:05.128 --> 43:06.868
Could we try it on my hair?

43:06.869 --> 43:08.952
It's all wet and stringy.

43:12.604 --> 43:14.437
I'll give it a shot.

43:18.595 --> 43:20.127
Stand back, mama.

43:20.128 --> 43:22.128
This is some heavy shit.

43:24.516 --> 43:27.099
(horn blowing)

43:28.719 --> 43:30.969
(tinkling)

43:32.713 --> 43:34.766
(babbling) Chili, sweet potato pie.

43:34.767 --> 43:38.934
(laughing) Change that
girly bitch in my eye.

43:43.010 --> 43:45.169
(exploding)

43:45.170 --> 43:47.837
(harp plucking)

43:50.162 --> 43:53.829
(gentle instrumental music)

43:56.176 --> 43:58.172
Damn, it works.

43:58.173 --> 44:01.590
This thing ain't going
in no garage sale.

44:11.455 --> 44:14.356
Fairy godmother, you've done it.

44:14.357 --> 44:17.863
Sure, I did. (Laughing)

44:17.864 --> 44:19.140
Come here, baby.

44:19.141 --> 44:21.474
Come on to your sweet daddy.

44:22.484 --> 44:26.477
Wait, oh no, I can't
get into the palace

44:26.478 --> 44:28.311
without my invitation.

44:29.288 --> 44:32.288
You ain't gonna
give up that easy.

44:38.785 --> 44:40.804
(horn blowing)

44:40.805 --> 44:43.288
Pasta. (Laughing)

44:43.289 --> 44:44.289
Lasagna.

44:47.005 --> 44:48.072
(chanting)

44:48.073 --> 44:50.881
Bring the invitation out the fire.

44:50.882 --> 44:53.549
(harp plucking)

44:56.153 --> 45:00.320
[Cinderella] Fairy godmother,
you've done it again.

45:04.187 --> 45:07.520
Hey mama, don't you
have any pumpkins?

45:08.413 --> 45:11.477
No, we've got some watermelons.

45:11.478 --> 45:12.499
(laughing)

45:12.500 --> 45:14.310
Watermelons? (Laughing)

45:14.311 --> 45:15.820
Yeah. (Laughing)

45:15.821 --> 45:18.234
Sure, I hate to waste one.
(laughing)

45:18.235 --> 45:21.230
All we gotta do is
find some horses.

45:21.231 --> 45:22.786
Any rests around here?

45:22.787 --> 45:24.272
No.

45:24.273 --> 45:25.248
(mumbling)

45:25.249 --> 45:27.476
I haven't seen any all year.

45:27.477 --> 45:29.310
But we've got lots of snails.

45:29.311 --> 45:31.354
Snails? (Laughing)

45:31.355 --> 45:34.070
Yeah, but that sure gonna
be a drag. (Laughing)

45:34.071 --> 45:35.071
Get it?

45:38.994 --> 45:43.161
Okay, little snails, soon
you'll be eating oats and hay.

45:46.912 --> 45:47.956
Step back, mama.

45:47.957 --> 45:48.957
Go on.

45:52.926 --> 45:55.224
(horn blowing)

45:55.225 --> 45:56.989
Ride them high.

45:56.990 --> 45:58.157
Ride them low.

45:59.010 --> 46:02.886
However you ride them,
ride them with so.

46:02.887 --> 46:05.220
(exploding)

46:11.688 --> 46:14.450
It's beautiful.

46:14.451 --> 46:16.818
Oh, fairy godmother,
it's beautiful.

46:16.819 --> 46:18.049
(neighing)

46:18.050 --> 46:19.582
White sails, black horses.

46:19.583 --> 46:20.666
Ride on wild.

46:21.603 --> 46:23.715
All we need now is a coachman.

46:23.716 --> 46:25.851
You're looking at him, honey.

46:25.852 --> 46:28.661
Oh, fairy godmother,
you're wonderful.

46:28.662 --> 46:29.682
(laughing)

46:29.683 --> 46:31.238
I guess we're all ready.

46:31.239 --> 46:33.003
Now quite, child.

46:33.004 --> 46:35.719
Step inside this coach here.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.720
(gasps)

46:41.641 --> 46:44.171
Pull up that dress
of yours child.

46:44.172 --> 46:45.286
What for?

46:45.287 --> 46:47.329
Did I ever tell you?

46:47.330 --> 46:48.913
Pull up that dress.

46:55.272 --> 46:59.355
And split those legs. (Laughing)

47:02.191 --> 47:04.774
(horn blowing)

47:07.439 --> 47:11.439
(chanting) The better be tight.

47:13.778 --> 47:14.984
(squeaking)

47:14.985 --> 47:15.984
(popping)

47:15.985 --> 47:17.144
(groans)

47:17.145 --> 47:19.512
(popping)

47:19.513 --> 47:21.680
(hooting)

47:25.365 --> 47:27.453
What was that for?

47:27.454 --> 47:31.006
They have tits and ass, and
a pretty face. (Laughing)

47:31.007 --> 47:35.174
But then I gave you as
napping pussy. (Laughing)

47:37.507 --> 47:38.507
[Cinderella] What for?

47:38.508 --> 47:39.708
You'll find out soon enough.

47:39.735 --> 47:41.827
And when you do. (Laughing)

47:41.828 --> 47:45.995
You'll thank me for it. (Laughing)

47:52.532 --> 47:56.595
I could use a bottle of
Dom Perignon champagne.

47:56.596 --> 47:58.057
(horn blowing)

47:58.058 --> 47:59.474
What?

47:59.475 --> 48:00.642
Do your stuff.

48:01.565 --> 48:04.232
(harp plucking)

48:07.905 --> 48:09.274
(swooshing)

48:09.275 --> 48:12.942
(gentle instrumental music)

48:18.424 --> 48:19.886
(mumbling) Shit.

48:19.887 --> 48:22.554
Does wine only work for honkies?

48:24.455 --> 48:26.538
Goddamn, get on up there.

48:31.166 --> 48:33.416
(laughing)

48:35.113 --> 48:36.714
Just a moment, my darling.

48:36.715 --> 48:38.850
Yes, my sweetheart.

48:38.851 --> 48:41.056
You must promise me
one thing, my darling.

48:41.057 --> 48:43.518
What is that, my sweetheart?

48:43.519 --> 48:46.583
You must control your
insatiable appetite tonight.

48:46.584 --> 48:49.555
Oh, I promise not to eat
any starters whatsoever,

48:49.556 --> 48:50.878
my sweetheart.

48:50.879 --> 48:52.272
I don't mean food, my darling.

48:52.273 --> 48:54.524
I mean. (Sniffs)

48:54.525 --> 48:55.824
(sneezes)

48:55.825 --> 48:56.992
Sex, sex, sex.

48:57.892 --> 48:59.191
(gasps) Oh, dear.

48:59.192 --> 49:00.236
(laughing)

49:00.237 --> 49:02.163
This is a very
important occasion.

49:02.164 --> 49:04.392
And we cannot afford
do jeopardize it.

49:04.393 --> 49:06.705
But how could we
possibly jeopardize

49:06.706 --> 49:09.027
the prince's birthday?

49:09.028 --> 49:12.394
I refer to the loan our
country's trying to obtain

49:12.395 --> 49:13.393
from the king.

49:13.394 --> 49:16.202
We must be on our best
behavior tonight.

49:16.203 --> 49:18.547
Well then, you stick
very close to me, darling,

49:18.548 --> 49:19.778
and you protect me.

49:19.779 --> 49:20.985
You know how the slightest.

49:20.986 --> 49:22.448
(bouncing)

49:22.449 --> 49:25.095
Little thing can just
set me right off.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.023
I will, my darling.

49:27.024 --> 49:29.321
Now, well, get in.

49:29.322 --> 49:30.691
(laughing)

49:30.692 --> 49:31.876
Get in.

49:31.877 --> 49:33.129
(laughing) Yes, yes, yes.

49:33.130 --> 49:34.383
Open the door, you fool.

49:34.384 --> 49:36.634
(laughing)

49:38.401 --> 49:39.401
Swine.

49:46.087 --> 49:48.803
Get off, coachman, get off.

49:48.804 --> 49:52.554
(playful instrumental music)

50:13.347 --> 50:15.514
(moaning)

50:24.259 --> 50:25.259
(grunt)

50:25.260 --> 50:26.280
Hit those rocks.

50:26.281 --> 50:28.927
Darling, control yourself.

50:28.928 --> 50:30.111
(laughing) I can't.

50:30.112 --> 50:32.456
(moaning)

50:32.457 --> 50:34.374
Oh here, hold my hands.

50:36.603 --> 50:37.624
Now hold my breasts.

50:37.625 --> 50:38.458
Sit still.

50:38.459 --> 50:40.869
(moans)

50:40.870 --> 50:42.773
Take your hands off me.

50:42.774 --> 50:44.398
(moans)

50:44.399 --> 50:45.420
Halt.

50:45.421 --> 50:46.488
(moans)

50:46.489 --> 50:47.489
Don't.

50:48.904 --> 50:49.904
Stop.

50:50.831 --> 50:51.831
Don't.

50:52.549 --> 50:53.549
Stop.

50:54.291 --> 50:55.822
Don't.

50:55.823 --> 50:57.982
(screaming)

50:57.983 --> 50:58.983
Stop, stop.

51:01.187 --> 51:03.520
(screaming)

51:17.802 --> 51:18.802
(roaring)

51:18.803 --> 51:20.243
Oh, oh, oh yes,
ride me hard, yes.

51:20.270 --> 51:22.344
(moaning)

51:22.345 --> 51:25.433
I've got something of a tummy.

51:25.434 --> 51:26.626
(babbling)

51:26.627 --> 51:27.460
Oh yes, oh yes.

51:27.460 --> 51:28.293
Wait a little for me wait.

51:28.293 --> 51:29.205
(moaning)

51:29.206 --> 51:31.015
(laughing)

51:31.016 --> 51:31.922
(screaming)

51:31.923 --> 51:33.174
Oh yeah, yeah.

51:33.175 --> 51:34.008
Wait, wait.

51:34.009 --> 51:36.341
(screaming)

52:21.334 --> 52:23.584
(rumbling)

52:28.485 --> 52:31.235
[Man] Damn prince's skateboard.

52:33.153 --> 52:34.236
How quaint.

52:35.753 --> 52:38.376
(laughing)

52:38.377 --> 52:41.093
You shall pay for
your clumsiness.

52:41.094 --> 52:42.046
(slaps)

52:42.046 --> 52:43.046
Both of you.

52:51.543 --> 52:54.376
(classical music)

53:05.452 --> 53:07.702
(laughing)

53:28.300 --> 53:30.748
We're going to the ball.
(laughing)

53:30.749 --> 53:31.582
Or you think I'm going to the ball.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.832
(laughing)

53:48.591 --> 53:50.591
(thuds)

53:54.396 --> 53:56.763
Let the dancing begin.

53:56.764 --> 53:59.014
(applause)

54:08.699 --> 54:11.532
(classical music)

54:31.385 --> 54:34.468
(upbeat disco music)

55:00.944 --> 55:03.777
(classical music)

55:11.796 --> 55:14.046
(applause)

55:54.010 --> 55:55.077
Oh no.

55:55.078 --> 55:56.078
Ha.

55:57.307 --> 55:58.474
Look at him.

56:00.511 --> 56:01.678
He's gorgeous.

56:04.923 --> 56:07.012
What do you think?

56:07.013 --> 56:08.013
10 inches?

56:09.567 --> 56:11.238
Quite cute.

56:11.239 --> 56:13.072
Eight inches, no more.

56:17.323 --> 56:18.343
10.

56:18.344 --> 56:19.388
Eight.

56:19.389 --> 56:20.364
10.

56:20.365 --> 56:21.501
Eight.

56:21.502 --> 56:23.752
Nine and a half at least.

56:30.860 --> 56:33.693
(classical music)

57:12.122 --> 57:14.025
(thuds)

57:14.026 --> 57:15.186
(screaming)

57:15.187 --> 57:17.740
The prince will now choose a
partner for the next dance.

57:17.741 --> 57:18.741
Shmuck.

57:22.332 --> 57:23.771
(classical music)

57:23.772 --> 57:26.022
(applause)

57:52.913 --> 57:56.256
I've met all the beautiful
maidens of the kingdom.

57:56.257 --> 57:59.089
But never have I seen you before.

57:59.090 --> 58:00.342
I know.

58:00.343 --> 58:02.990
You're a visitor from
another kingdom.

58:02.991 --> 58:05.010
No, my prince.

58:05.011 --> 58:06.798
What is your name?

58:06.799 --> 58:09.886
My name is Cinde...
Never mind.

58:09.887 --> 58:11.279
The night is young.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.555
You will tell me later.

58:13.556 --> 58:15.973
I love the mystery about you.

58:17.433 --> 58:20.266
Tonight, I dance with no one else.

58:23.099 --> 58:25.182
(clicks)

58:26.234 --> 58:29.067
(classical music)

59:18.780 --> 59:20.591
If I can't play in the palace,

59:20.592 --> 59:22.009
I'm gonna rob it.

59:26.722 --> 59:28.805
(sniffs)

59:33.479 --> 59:35.729
(mumbling)

59:40.956 --> 59:44.507
If I can't be a king, I'm
sure I don't smell like one.

59:44.508 --> 59:46.758
(laughing)

59:56.141 --> 59:58.277
[Woman] I bet he likes dogs.

59:58.278 --> 59:59.507
Right.

59:59.508 --> 01:00:00.552
That's why...

01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:01.833
[Woman] Why are we doing here?

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.664
This dog show here today.

01:00:03.665 --> 01:00:04.665
Creep.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.024
And now, fair ladies,
the game you've been

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.743
waiting for all evening.

01:00:12.744 --> 01:00:14.322
Backgammon.

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:15.692
Here are the rules.

01:00:15.693 --> 01:00:18.757
When the pointer spins
and points at a maiden,

01:00:18.758 --> 01:00:21.334
she will come behind
the screen to my bed

01:00:21.335 --> 01:00:23.502
and them bow to my wishes.

01:00:24.516 --> 01:00:27.302
I will now put my blindfold on.

01:00:27.303 --> 01:00:31.179
Any of you who do not
wish to play the game,

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.526
may leave.

01:00:32.527 --> 01:00:36.694
And forever hold your piece.
(laughing)

01:00:40.422 --> 01:00:42.650

01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:44.809

01:02:37.736 --> 01:02:40.569

01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.736

01:02:52.737 --> 01:02:54.737

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.592
(mumbling)

01:03:36.587 --> 01:03:38.507
You play it down on my
gal, I'll pull your ass

01:03:38.508 --> 01:03:41.224
all over your head and
make your dumb ass.

01:03:41.225 --> 01:03:42.826
(growls)

01:03:42.827 --> 01:03:44.956
You (speaking in foreign language).

01:03:44.957 --> 01:03:46.605
Now get out.

01:03:46.606 --> 01:03:48.939
(shrieking)

01:03:50.019 --> 01:03:52.108

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:32.174
(moaning)

01:08:50.198 --> 01:08:53.365
Hello. (Whispering)

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:02.229
Don't smear my lipstick.

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:26.313
(screaming)

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:31.412
Oh not me.

01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:35.707
(whispering)

01:09:50.282 --> 01:09:52.532
(groaning)

01:09:57.108 --> 01:09:59.275

01:11:36.122 --> 01:11:38.289
(gasping)

01:11:45.247 --> 01:11:46.965
The sensation.

01:11:46.966 --> 01:11:47.966
It snaps.

01:11:48.963 --> 01:11:51.296
(screaming)

01:11:53.258 --> 01:11:55.341
Fairy, fairy godmother.

01:11:56.184 --> 01:11:58.767
Yes, he gave me snapping pussy.

01:12:01.269 --> 01:12:03.288
A snapping pussy.

01:12:03.289 --> 01:12:05.866
The kingdom has a snapper.
(laughing)

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:09.720
A snapper, the kingdom
has a snapper.

01:12:09.721 --> 01:12:10.721
Chamberlain.

01:12:11.598 --> 01:12:12.598
(moaning)

01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:14.847
A snapper.

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:24.225
Do you know what I'm smelling.

01:12:24.226 --> 01:12:26.988
I smell a snapping pussy.

01:12:26.989 --> 01:12:30.216
Why you don't got
no snapping pussy.

01:12:30.217 --> 01:12:33.002
(speaking in foreign language)

01:12:33.003 --> 01:12:34.581
(bell tolling)

01:12:34.582 --> 01:12:35.581
Snapper.

(moaning)

01:12:36.904 --> 01:12:39.237

01:12:45.635 --> 01:12:47.585
A snapping pussy. (Laughing)

01:12:47.586 --> 01:12:49.187
Chamberlain.

01:12:49.188 --> 01:12:50.186
A snapping.

01:12:50.187 --> 01:12:51.486
(screaming)

01:12:51.487 --> 01:12:55.505
It's time.

01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:58.103
(bells tolling)

01:12:58.104 --> 01:12:59.171
It's time.

01:12:59.172 --> 01:13:00.239
Time up, mama.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.726
Time, time, time.

01:13:01.727 --> 01:13:02.910
(screaming)

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.721
Time, time, time.

01:13:04.722 --> 01:13:05.722
It's time.

01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:07.810
Snapper.

01:13:07.811 --> 01:13:09.202
A snapper.

01:13:09.203 --> 01:13:10.203
The snapper.

01:13:11.107 --> 01:13:12.546
Let go, man.

01:13:12.547 --> 01:13:13.614
(screaming)

01:13:13.615 --> 01:13:14.845
Let go snapper.

01:13:14.846 --> 01:13:15.846
Mine.

01:13:17.772 --> 01:13:20.069
(laughing)

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:23.901

01:16:46.516 --> 01:16:47.516
I know.

01:16:49.976 --> 01:16:54.758
Why don't you put inside
where it's a little stabler.

01:16:54.759 --> 01:16:57.196
Then you know what we seek?

01:16:57.197 --> 01:16:59.332
If this glass slipper
should fit one

01:16:59.333 --> 01:17:01.399
of your lovely daughters,
then they will the bride

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.567
of the prince.

01:17:04.163 --> 01:17:07.645

we leave the prince

01:17:12.615 --> 01:17:15.076

01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:18.164
I'm sure they'd be
more at ease that way.

01:17:18.165 --> 01:17:22.332
Oh of course, my lord. (Laughing)

01:17:41.756 --> 01:17:43.404
Is it nice there in the palace?

01:17:43.405 --> 01:17:45.488
Will I like living there?

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:49.580
It fits both of you.

01:17:51.346 --> 01:17:53.179
Tell the truth, girls.

01:17:54.481 --> 01:17:56.152
Were one of you one of the ones

01:17:56.153 --> 01:17:59.588
who left me behind
that screen during

01:17:59.589 --> 01:18:01.841
our little game last night?

01:18:01.842 --> 01:18:03.925
Yes we were, my prince.

01:18:05.089 --> 01:18:09.256
When she held me with you
know, it was like a vice.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.110
Her charms did indeed snap at me.

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:17.813
Well mine snaps and crackles.

01:18:17.814 --> 01:18:19.147
And mine pops.

01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:21.711
We shall see.

01:18:23.317 --> 01:18:24.400
We shall see.

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:33.915
What exactly is it that you do?

01:18:37.388 --> 01:18:38.638
Not even pop?

01:18:42.659 --> 01:18:45.793
How many people would have to die

01:18:45.794 --> 01:18:47.544
before I became king?

01:18:50.554 --> 01:18:52.887
(screaming)

01:18:54.525 --> 01:18:56.172
Do you feel it snap?

01:18:56.173 --> 01:18:57.589
No.

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.673
(groans)

01:19:01.814 --> 01:19:02.814
Crackle?

01:19:02.815 --> 01:19:03.858
No.

01:19:03.859 --> 01:19:06.552
(moans)

01:19:06.553 --> 01:19:09.386
(classical music)

01:19:29.424 --> 01:19:31.002
No, no more.

01:19:31.003 --> 01:19:33.138
I've been searching for days now.

01:19:33.139 --> 01:19:35.089
Not only can't I find my snapper,

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.090
I can't find my pee-pee.

01:19:47.466 --> 01:19:49.648
(laughing)

01:19:49.649 --> 01:19:51.389
His majesty, the prince.

01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:53.317
Oh, the prince do.

01:19:53.318 --> 01:19:55.824
Come in, do. (Laughing)

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:57.575
Yes, yes, the prince.

01:19:59.123 --> 01:20:01.606
Your highness. (Laughing)

01:20:01.607 --> 01:20:03.774
(hooting)

01:20:10.361 --> 01:20:12.944
Prince-y, not quite king sized.

01:20:14.216 --> 01:20:16.466
(laughing)

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:24.292
You remember my daughters
at the ball that night.

01:20:24.293 --> 01:20:26.196
Could I ever forget them.

01:20:26.197 --> 01:20:27.030
(laughing)

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:29.702
Oh we're so happy, my prince.

01:20:29.703 --> 01:20:31.026
Yes, we waited so long.

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:32.535
Never mind all this.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:34.160
Ladies, please.

01:20:34.161 --> 01:20:35.994
Try the slippers, yes.

01:20:39.525 --> 01:20:40.592
Give me that.

01:20:40.593 --> 01:20:41.916
(grunting)

01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:43.657
(laughing)

01:20:43.658 --> 01:20:47.825
[Stepmother] Oh, playful lot, eh?
(laughing)

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.360
Looks right. (Laughing)

01:20:56.824 --> 01:20:58.054
(snorting)

01:20:58.055 --> 01:21:00.515
I guess my feet swelled up
from dancing last night.

01:21:00.516 --> 01:21:02.675
I'm sure if we try tomorrow.

01:21:02.676 --> 01:21:04.904
Never mind tomorrow,
give me that.

01:21:04.905 --> 01:21:07.548
(laughing)

01:21:07.549 --> 01:21:08.549
Phew.

01:21:10.126 --> 01:21:12.209
(coughs)

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:21.201
(laughing) Oh, they say
that glass shrinks at night

01:21:21.202 --> 01:21:23.452
or the daylight sometimes.

01:21:24.636 --> 01:21:26.353
Let us be off, Chamberlain.

01:21:26.354 --> 01:21:27.746
Not yet, my prince.

01:21:27.747 --> 01:21:28.747
Not yet?

01:21:31.091 --> 01:21:33.674
But there's nothing left of me.

01:21:35.386 --> 01:21:37.553
There's one maiden left.

01:21:39.868 --> 01:21:41.655
Oh, don't worry about her.

01:21:41.656 --> 01:21:43.420
My lord, she's never had on shoes,

01:21:43.421 --> 01:21:45.974
let alone glass slippers.

01:21:45.975 --> 01:21:48.365
Anyway, she never
went to the ball.

01:21:48.366 --> 01:21:50.409
I should say not.

01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:53.125
But I remember giving
her an invitation myself.

01:21:53.126 --> 01:21:54.459
Come here, girl.

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:09.870
Let her sit.

01:22:27.956 --> 01:22:30.039
(groans)

01:22:41.378 --> 01:22:44.295
I know the slipper fits, my dear.

01:22:45.696 --> 01:22:48.279
What did you say your name was?

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.827
My name is Cinde...

01:22:50.828 --> 01:22:52.058
Never mind, girl.

01:22:52.059 --> 01:22:54.142
It's no use, it's no use.

01:22:55.101 --> 01:22:58.002
You couldn't possibly be the one.

01:22:58.003 --> 01:23:01.346
What I mean is, you could
hardly be the one who,

01:23:01.347 --> 01:23:03.764
who possesses, possesses the.

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:09.821
(gentle instrumental music)

01:23:09.822 --> 01:23:10.822
Oh no.

01:23:12.608 --> 01:23:13.608
Oh no, no.

01:23:31.344 --> 01:23:33.094
You can't be the one.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:35.943
No, no, no.

01:23:39.633 --> 01:23:40.633
No, you, no.

01:23:43.883 --> 01:23:44.883
No, no, no.

01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:47.901
No, no, yes.

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.107
Yes, yes, yes.

01:23:56.468 --> 01:23:57.635
Yes, yes, yes.

01:24:00.206 --> 01:24:01.373
Yes, yes, yes.

01:24:03.829 --> 01:24:04.996
She's the one.

01:24:06.104 --> 01:24:07.521
She's my snapper.

01:24:13.279 --> 01:24:15.995
(moans)

01:24:15.996 --> 01:24:18.470
Why didn't you bother to tell me,

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:22.638
she was the one with the
snapping pussy. (Laughing)

01:24:24.694 --> 01:24:28.873
She was always my favorite.
(laughing)

01:24:28.874 --> 01:24:30.730
She's my favorite.

01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:33.648
Hop on my children, hop on, hop on.

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.019
Do it, do it.

01:24:38.553 --> 01:24:40.553
(moans)

01:24:59.103 --> 01:25:01.686
(drum beating)

01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:18.410
Oh, look at all the commotion.

01:25:18.411 --> 01:25:21.359
It must be the pleasure fair.
(laughing)

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.144
[Godmother] Oh looks like
it is the end of my roots.

01:25:24.145 --> 01:25:26.728
(drum beating)

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.227
(yelling)

01:25:52.776 --> 01:25:55.026
(laughing)

01:25:56.978 --> 01:25:58.145
Off with it.

01:25:59.718 --> 01:26:02.480
(laughing)

01:26:02.481 --> 01:26:05.064
(drum beating)

01:26:12.513 --> 01:26:13.765
It's my fairy godmother.

01:26:13.766 --> 01:26:14.903
We've got to save him.

01:26:14.904 --> 01:26:16.087
Your what?

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.838
I'll explain later.

01:26:19.362 --> 01:26:20.362
Halt.

01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:37.218
What has this man done?

01:26:37.219 --> 01:26:40.074
Last night at the great ball
in your honor, my prince,

01:26:40.075 --> 01:26:42.094
he cleaned out the palace.

01:26:42.095 --> 01:26:45.739
Furs, shawls, all
matter of perfumes,

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.407
and above all, the royal jewels.

01:26:50.825 --> 01:26:52.658
Oh yes, two corn cobs.

01:26:56.793 --> 01:26:59.903
But my dear, this
is a serious offense.

01:26:59.904 --> 01:27:03.410
My prince, I beseech
thee, it wasn't for him

01:27:03.411 --> 01:27:05.314
we'd never have met.

01:27:05.315 --> 01:27:07.148
What are you saying?

01:27:08.055 --> 01:27:10.167
He gave the one who
gave me the snapper.

01:27:10.168 --> 01:27:11.168
He what?

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:16.307
You release him,
or no more snapper.

01:27:17.319 --> 01:27:18.781
Release that man.

01:27:18.782 --> 01:27:20.949
He's in my protection now.

01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:24.869
Goodbye, fairy friend.

01:27:30.299 --> 01:27:33.085
Which of you honkies got my bag?

01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:34.169
Here it is.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.360
Thank you one and all.

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:43.546
(playful instrumental music)

01:27:51.383 --> 01:27:53.054
Wait for me, mama.

01:27:53.055 --> 01:27:54.076
I'm going with you.

01:27:54.077 --> 01:27:55.917
Just one time, I don't
mind riding at the back

01:27:55.944 --> 01:27:57.489
of the coach.

01:27:57.490 --> 01:28:01.240
(playful instrumental music)

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:16.738
(screaming)

01:28:16.739 --> 01:28:18.410
Snap on now.

01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:21.013
Snap on.

01:28:30.927 --> 01:28:34.455
And Cinderella lived
happily ever after,

01:28:34.456 --> 01:28:38.623
thanks to my snap judgment.
(laughing)

01:28:44.441 --> 01:28:46.941
(upbeat song)
