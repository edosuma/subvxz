00:21.663 --> 00:23.745
(Group)
Keeper of the Underworld,

00:23.746 --> 00:25.992
hear our prayer.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.999
Though we walk in this world,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.230
we live only
to extinguish the light.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.078
We bow before you

00:33.079 --> 00:35.354
and faithfully do
your bidding.

00:35.355 --> 00:37.246
Sisters,

00:37.247 --> 00:39.159
twice now
Nicci has failed

00:39.160 --> 00:41.083
to kill
the Mother Confessor.

00:41.084 --> 00:44.116
She shames us all
in the eyes of the Keeper.

00:44.117 --> 00:46.445
But we can succeed
where she has failed.

00:46.446 --> 00:49.199
How?
By taking her han.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.465
She's too powerful.

00:52.466 --> 00:54.515
Which is why we need
to increase our strength.

00:54.516 --> 00:57.065
Some of you will have to
sacrifice your han.

00:58.341 --> 01:00.629
How will we decide?

01:00.630 --> 01:02.270
We've already decided.

01:02.271 --> 01:05.391
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

01:05.393 --> 01:07.039
( gasping )

01:10.327 --> 01:12.405
Great Keeper
of the Underworld,

01:12.406 --> 01:15.961
as I walk on the path
to eternal darkness,

01:15.962 --> 01:19.079
grant me the strength
to carry your will.

01:30.271 --> 01:31.612
Merissa,

01:31.613 --> 01:35.194
do you really think
your han can compete with mine?

01:35.195 --> 01:37.204
I'm not here to compete
with your han,

01:37.205 --> 01:38.476
I'm here to take it.

01:38.477 --> 01:41.057
There are only four
of you.

01:41.058 --> 01:42.765
Either you overestimate
your power,

01:42.766 --> 01:45.342
or you underestimate mine.

01:45.343 --> 01:49.094
Each of us already killed
two Sisters.

01:49.095 --> 01:50.565
And each
of those two Sisters

01:50.566 --> 01:52.644
had previously killed five.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.616
So you see, Nicci,

01:54.617 --> 01:56.458
the odds aren't 4-to-1,

01:56.459 --> 01:58.599
but 40-to-1.

01:59.707 --> 02:01.211
( chants in ancient tongue )

02:01.212 --> 02:03.254
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

02:16.195 --> 02:18.805
( chanting in ancient tongue )

02:22.886 --> 02:26.196
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

02:27.635 --> 02:29.339
Sister Nicci.

02:29.340 --> 02:32.683
Lord Rahl,
have I displeased the Keeper?

02:32.684 --> 02:35.159
The stench of your failure
passes through the veil

02:35.160 --> 02:38.269
to sicken him even
in the Underworld.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.475
Yet there is one way

02:40.476 --> 02:42.214
you may regain his favor.

02:42.215 --> 02:43.618
Tell me.

02:43.619 --> 02:45.960
Bring me the Stone of Tears.

02:45.961 --> 02:48.032
Lord Rahl,
the compass which points

02:48.033 --> 02:51.141
to the Stone of Tears only works
in the hands of the Seeker.

02:51.142 --> 02:53.715
Well, then, if you cannot
control the compass,

02:53.716 --> 02:56.893
you must find a way
to control the Seeker.

02:58.064 --> 02:59.433
What about
the Mother Confessor?

02:59.434 --> 03:02.075
Prophecy says that the Keeper
is doomed to fail

03:02.076 --> 03:04.181
as long as
her pure heart beats.

03:04.182 --> 03:05.585
We can address
the problem

03:05.586 --> 03:07.758
of the Mother Confessor's
beating heart

03:07.759 --> 03:11.002
once you get the Stone
from the Seeker.

03:16.111 --> 03:17.916
I may know a way

03:17.917 --> 03:19.754
to control the Seeker,

03:19.755 --> 03:21.993
find the Stone,

03:21.994 --> 03:25.302
and kill
the Mother Confessor.

03:25.303 --> 03:28.412
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

03:50.635 --> 03:52.237
( bird chirps )

03:54.778 --> 03:57.518
A strand of
the Mother Confessor's hair.

03:57.519 --> 04:00.023
You have served
the Keeper well.

04:04.936 --> 04:07.408
( chanting in ancient tongue )

04:14.947 --> 04:16.880
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

04:22.752 --> 04:24.918
( gasps )

04:24.919 --> 04:27.052
What's wrong?

04:27.053 --> 04:28.687
Oh, I just didn't sleep
very well.

04:34.225 --> 04:35.859
Cara probably won't be back
from her hunt

04:35.860 --> 04:37.694
for a little while
if you want to get more rest.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.394
I'm sure it will be fine.

04:39.395 --> 04:41.295
(Cara)
Richard.

04:42.762 --> 04:45.197
I was chasing a buck.

04:45.198 --> 04:46.432
I found something better.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.167
Where are the rest
of your Sisters?

04:50.736 --> 04:52.468
(Cara)
Answer him.

04:52.469 --> 04:53.901
( Agiel whines )
( screams )

04:53.902 --> 04:55.101
( screaming )

04:57.037 --> 04:58.137
Cara, stop!

04:58.138 --> 05:00.305
( gasping )
( gasping )

05:03.207 --> 05:04.740
What has she done to me?

05:04.741 --> 05:06.942
She's cast
the Maternity Spell.

05:06.943 --> 05:08.644
It replicates the connection

05:08.645 --> 05:10.345
between the mother
and a child in the womb.

05:10.346 --> 05:12.747
Whatever happens to the mother
happens to the child.

05:12.748 --> 05:17.051
Kahlan's survival is now
completely dependent upon mine.

05:17.052 --> 05:20.420
(Zedd)
A spell of that magnitude would
require all of your han.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.989
She can't use any other magic.

05:21.990 --> 05:24.724
I don't need any other magic
to get what I want.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.528
An Alkalis stone.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.398
I'm sure you know it's deadly.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.966
If you don't do as I say,

05:34.967 --> 05:36.834
all I have
to do is bite down,

05:36.835 --> 05:38.835
and the Mother Confessor
will die.

05:38.836 --> 05:41.004
And what is it
that you want?

05:41.005 --> 05:43.806
You're going to lead me
to the Stone of Tears.

05:45.275 --> 05:48.110
And if any of you attempt
to follow us Kahlan will die.

05:48.111 --> 05:50.111
And so will you.
I serve the Keeper.

05:50.112 --> 05:52.079
I'm not afraid of death.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.815
Neither are the four
powerful Sisters of the Dark

05:54.816 --> 05:56.817
who are trying to kill me
and take my han.

05:56.818 --> 05:58.584
Since I can't use my magic,

05:58.585 --> 06:00.252
I need your protection.

06:00.253 --> 06:01.753
If you want her to live.

06:03.189 --> 06:05.356
Kill her.

06:05.357 --> 06:07.458
Cara can bring me back
with the breath of life.

06:07.459 --> 06:09.328
To revive her,
you'd have to revive me,

06:09.329 --> 06:11.264
and we'd be right back
where we started.

06:14.035 --> 06:15.401
I'm going to the bridge now

06:15.402 --> 06:17.737
and if you're not with me
by the time I get there,

06:17.738 --> 06:20.372
the Mother Confessor and I
will meet the Keeper together.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.480
We can't let her do this.

06:31.481 --> 06:33.848
She's using my life
as a weapon against you.

06:33.849 --> 06:35.583
Right now
we don't have a choice.

06:35.584 --> 06:37.018
Zedd will find
a way to undo the spell.

06:39.954 --> 06:42.088
Whatever happens,

06:42.089 --> 06:44.056
do not let her
get the Stone.

06:45.758 --> 06:47.259
I won't let anything
happen to you.

06:49.161 --> 06:51.596
Then you'd best not let
anything happen to her.

07:03.138 --> 07:04.971
Do you know how
to break the spell?

07:04.972 --> 07:06.673
(Zedd) I do, but--
But what?

07:06.674 --> 07:08.708
The only way to break
the bond is to re-establish

07:08.709 --> 07:10.476
the stronger bond.

07:11.878 --> 07:13.411
The one with
Kahlan's real mother.

07:15.114 --> 07:16.881
My mother is dead.

07:16.882 --> 07:18.415
(Zedd)
There may still be a way.

07:18.416 --> 07:20.683
The Maternity Spell extends
through death.

07:20.684 --> 07:22.385
So does the bond
with your mother.

07:22.386 --> 07:24.386
I could summon her spirit
from the Underworld.

07:24.387 --> 07:27.089
I'd be able to see
her again?

07:27.090 --> 07:28.857
It wouldn't last
more than a few moments,

07:28.858 --> 07:30.792
but it may just long enough
for me to re-establish

07:30.793 --> 07:32.760
the bond
and break the spell.

07:32.761 --> 07:34.028
Then do it.

07:34.029 --> 07:35.863
Conjuring the dead
isn't that simple.

07:35.864 --> 07:37.198
It's a complicated spell.

07:37.199 --> 07:39.033
It requires many ingredients,

07:39.034 --> 07:41.201
the most important being
an object that belonged

07:41.202 --> 07:44.038
to your mother.
Something she treasured.

07:45.406 --> 07:47.439
When Dennee and I left home,
we were lucky to get away

07:47.440 --> 07:50.107
with the clothes
on our backs.

07:50.108 --> 07:52.475
My father has everything
my mother owned.

07:55.112 --> 07:57.212
(Zedd)
Do you know where
we can find him?

07:59.615 --> 08:02.283
Last I heard,
he was living in Gramalia.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.655
( <i>mysterious theme playing</i> )

08:13.726 --> 08:17.029
Even if we find the Stone
and you destroy it,

08:17.030 --> 08:20.064
even if you kill yourself
and take Kahlan with you,

08:20.065 --> 08:21.332
you won't win.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.438
Your fight against
the Keeper is futile.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.306
In the end, he will win.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.342
He always does.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.777
Life is fleeting,

08:30.778 --> 08:33.811
death is eternal.

08:33.812 --> 08:35.779
( blade clangs in distance )

08:35.780 --> 08:37.381
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

08:37.381 --> 08:39.150
( gasps )

08:40.587 --> 08:42.288
They found us.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.457
Run.

08:50.351 --> 08:52.185
(Zedd)
Gramalia's just over
that ridge.

08:53.209 --> 08:56.946
My father's estate
is just west of that river.

08:56.947 --> 08:58.814
If he's still there.

08:58.815 --> 09:01.082
(Cara)
How long has it been?

09:01.083 --> 09:02.350
Fifteen years.

09:03.952 --> 09:05.486
Close family.

09:05.487 --> 09:07.688
Cara.
(Kahlan) It's all right.

09:07.689 --> 09:10.590
When my father was
confessed to my mother,

09:10.591 --> 09:12.959
of course he was completely
devoted to us.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.695
But when she died,
we found out who he really was.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.130
I was 5.

09:20.131 --> 09:21.864
Dennee was only 3.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.466
He forced us to confess people

09:26.467 --> 09:28.467
so he could build
his own fortune.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.803
Men with wives,
families,

09:31.804 --> 09:34.137
turned into slaves.

09:34.138 --> 09:38.176
They gave him
everything they had.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.779
There was one man, Devon.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.246
When we confessed him,

09:42.247 --> 09:45.115
his wife was devastated.

09:45.116 --> 09:47.817
She begged us to give her
husband back to her.

09:47.818 --> 09:50.686
I remember thinking
that next to my mother

09:50.687 --> 09:53.388
she was the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

09:53.389 --> 09:55.390
My father thought so too.

09:57.059 --> 09:58.860
He made us confess her

09:58.861 --> 10:02.229
and order her to his bed.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.964
You had a power, he didn't.

10:04.965 --> 10:06.732
You could have confessed him.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.935
I know that now,
but he was this huge,

10:09.936 --> 10:15.339
terrifying man, and--

10:15.340 --> 10:17.274
(Zedd)
You shouldn't talk
about this, Kahlan.

10:17.275 --> 10:19.109
It's upsetting you.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.676
It's not that.

10:20.677 --> 10:22.411
(Cara)
What is it?

10:22.412 --> 10:24.279
( panting )

10:24.280 --> 10:25.447
It's Nicci.

10:25.448 --> 10:27.449
( panting )

10:27.450 --> 10:31.287
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

10:31.288 --> 10:33.124
Wait, wait.

10:33.125 --> 10:35.493
I've seen this before.
This whole field is loaded

10:35.494 --> 10:37.628
with dragon's breath mines
left over from the war.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.796
If we cross it, the Sisters
won't be able to follow us.

10:39.797 --> 10:41.431
They won't need to.
We'll be dead.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.399
I can get us through.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.467
Follow my footsteps exactly.

10:48.804 --> 10:51.839
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

11:00.884 --> 11:02.151
Hurry, they're getting closer.

11:10.627 --> 11:11.727
( mine ticking )

11:19.400 --> 11:22.735
We can't go through.
It's too dangerous.

11:27.438 --> 11:30.506
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

11:31.908 --> 11:33.709
( gasps )

11:34.978 --> 11:36.478
Nicci's been hurt.

11:37.714 --> 11:40.249
Which means Richard's
in danger.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.185
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

11:48.158 --> 11:51.093
( mine clicks )
Don't move.

11:51.094 --> 11:52.594
Dragon's breath
doesn't explode

11:52.595 --> 11:55.030
when somebody steps on it,
but when somebody steps off it.

12:02.437 --> 12:05.205
Stay low and don't move.

12:05.206 --> 12:08.074
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

12:20.320 --> 12:21.954
Now...

12:21.955 --> 12:24.557
I'm gonna put down the rock,
you shift your hand.

12:24.558 --> 12:25.724
Do you understand?
Yeah.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.062
Now.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.100
Okay.

12:36.101 --> 12:37.701
Come on.

12:41.638 --> 12:45.005
They're too far.
Don't waste your dacra.

12:45.006 --> 12:47.439
I have another idea.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.173
( chanting in ancient tongue )

12:57.641 --> 12:59.572
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

13:01.840 --> 13:03.974
I've tried every spell I know.

13:03.975 --> 13:06.410
The wound won't heal
until Nicci heals hers

13:06.411 --> 13:07.744
and she can't use any magic.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.946
Then we'll just have to
keep it clean then.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.316
Your father isn't
at the manor.

13:14.317 --> 13:15.383
He moved?

13:15.384 --> 13:18.120
Something like that.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.330
Well, well.

13:27.331 --> 13:29.832
Hello, Father.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.900
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

13:37.358 --> 13:38.858
If you've come
to pass judgment on me,

13:38.859 --> 13:40.426
you're too late.

13:40.427 --> 13:42.494
I don't need to judge you.

13:42.495 --> 13:44.196
I'm sure you're guilty
of whatever it is

13:44.197 --> 13:46.298
you've been
locked up for and more.

13:46.299 --> 13:49.367
I'm sure you didn't come all
this way just to insult me.

13:51.003 --> 13:53.203
I've come
for my mother's things.

13:53.204 --> 13:54.371
Where are they?

13:54.372 --> 13:56.140
I burned them.

13:56.141 --> 13:57.976
(Kahlan)
I doubt that.

13:57.977 --> 14:01.012
My mother's jewels
were very valuable.

14:02.748 --> 14:05.883
And as much as you hated
my mother,

14:05.884 --> 14:08.085
we both know you love
wealth more.

14:08.086 --> 14:09.619
Don't you have
a palace filled

14:09.620 --> 14:12.655
with jewels in Aydindril?

14:12.656 --> 14:14.090
What do you want with mine?

14:14.091 --> 14:15.824
They aren't yours.

14:15.825 --> 14:18.793
Unfortunately,
that's true.

14:18.794 --> 14:21.495
They belong to a warlord
named Aramis now.

14:21.496 --> 14:25.365
When Rahl fell, Aramis
seized control of Gramalia

14:25.366 --> 14:28.001
and threw everyone
who opposed him into jail.

14:28.002 --> 14:30.736
My estate was the most
admired in the province,

14:30.737 --> 14:34.205
so Aramis took it,
and everything in it.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.940
Then we'll get
the jewels from him.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.443
Aramis doesn't even know
that he has the jewels.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.349
What do you mean
he doesn't know?

14:47.352 --> 14:50.818
Oh, my dear daughter,
I'm not a fool.

14:50.819 --> 14:53.419
Life has taught me that
in a single moment,

14:53.420 --> 14:54.586
you can lose everything.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.320
I buried the jewels,

14:57.321 --> 14:59.321
your mother's
and all the rest,

14:59.322 --> 15:00.821
on the grounds
for safekeeping.

15:00.822 --> 15:01.755
Where?

15:06.258 --> 15:07.591
Tell me.

15:07.592 --> 15:10.193
Or what?

15:10.194 --> 15:11.659
You'll confess me?

15:12.960 --> 15:15.862
Would you make a love slave
of your own father?

15:23.975 --> 15:26.779
A sorceress put
a dark spell on Kahlan.

15:26.780 --> 15:30.019
Whatever happens to
the sorceress happens to her.

15:30.020 --> 15:33.857
If you don't help us,
your daughter could die.

15:36.193 --> 15:37.359
(Frederick)
Hm.

15:41.063 --> 15:42.563
One word
from the Mother Confessor

15:42.564 --> 15:43.931
could get me out
of this hellhole.

15:43.932 --> 15:45.265
and I could
take you there myself.

15:48.002 --> 15:50.536
I can arrange
a short furlough.

15:50.537 --> 15:51.904
( chuckling ):
That's...

15:51.905 --> 15:53.805
That's not good enough.

15:56.108 --> 15:59.543
I lost six years of my life
when I was confessed,

15:59.544 --> 16:01.711
I have wasted months
behind these bars.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.481
I will not lose
any more time.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.250
Do we have a deal?

16:08.251 --> 16:11.620
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

16:15.591 --> 16:17.291
It's gotten worse.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.162
There's a farm up ahead.
We'll stop there and treat it.

16:23.163 --> 16:25.996
My hand is fine. You're only
worried about Kahlan.

16:25.997 --> 16:28.198
If you don't
treat this properly,

16:28.199 --> 16:29.532
it's going to fester.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.467
And that'll slow us down,
is that what you want?

16:35.003 --> 16:36.404
How does that feel, dear?

16:36.405 --> 16:38.739
Better. Thank you.

16:38.740 --> 16:41.275
(Richard)
Why is your husband
destroying his crop?

16:41.276 --> 16:45.381
Our fields have been
overtaken by snakevine.

16:45.382 --> 16:47.750
It feeds on whatever we grow.

16:47.751 --> 16:51.953
A few weeks ago the vines
overran our neighbors' garden,

16:51.954 --> 16:55.589
crept in at the window,
strangled their little boy

16:55.590 --> 16:58.591
while he was playing
in front of the hearth.

16:58.592 --> 17:00.726
Poor child.

17:00.727 --> 17:03.561
You know, the Sword of Truth can
cut through just about anything.

17:03.562 --> 17:05.762
I could help your husband
kill the snakevine.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.098
Bless you, Seeker.

17:08.098 --> 17:10.467
He's been in that
field for days.

17:11.935 --> 17:14.837
Edwin.

17:14.838 --> 17:16.204
Edwin?

17:18.275 --> 17:20.175
Tell them you don't have time.

17:31.121 --> 17:34.789
Edwin, this is the Seeker.

17:34.790 --> 17:36.358
He's going to help us.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.826
I'm so sorry, but I don't have
time to help you after all.

17:40.261 --> 17:41.660
I'll come back as soon as I can.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.299
I could've killed
the snakevine.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.634
It wouldn't have taken long.

17:50.635 --> 17:53.570
Do you always stop along
your quest to help people?

17:53.571 --> 17:56.472
No wonder you haven't found
the Stone of Tears.

17:56.473 --> 17:58.140
Even if you had solved
their problem,

17:58.141 --> 17:59.741
what about the people
at the next farm?

17:59.742 --> 18:01.009
And the next?

18:01.010 --> 18:02.776
You know, just because
I can't help everyone

18:02.777 --> 18:04.311
doesn't mean I shouldn't
help anyone.

18:04.312 --> 18:06.078
That's exactly
where you're wrong.

18:06.079 --> 18:08.480
What would you do with a horse
whose leg was broken?

18:08.481 --> 18:10.514
You'd put it out
of its misery.

18:10.515 --> 18:13.248
This world
is like a lame horse.

18:13.249 --> 18:16.317
Helping people only prolongs
their suffering.

18:18.587 --> 18:21.921
(Fredrick)
The treasure's in a clearing
past those trees.

18:21.922 --> 18:23.990
If you can catch one
of the guards by surprise

18:23.991 --> 18:26.525
and confess him, you could
order him to kill the rest.

18:26.526 --> 18:27.959
No.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.828
We'll wait until nightfall
and slip in unseen

18:30.829 --> 18:33.430
and get the jewels without
killing or confessing anyone.

18:33.431 --> 18:36.566
Isn't that what you do,
confess people?

18:37.700 --> 18:39.934
You don't know anything
about me.

18:39.935 --> 18:43.970
Frederick, why don't you
and I circle the grounds,

18:43.971 --> 18:45.938
see what we're
up against?

18:56.018 --> 18:58.052
He may be a bastard,

18:58.053 --> 19:01.023
but his strategy was sound.

19:01.024 --> 19:03.159
It was brutal and cowardly.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.095
Just like he is.

19:06.297 --> 19:08.731
I believed the worst
about my father,

19:10.969 --> 19:12.738
but I was wrong.

19:12.739 --> 19:15.841
It isn't the same.

19:15.842 --> 19:17.675
You were tortured
into thinking

19:17.676 --> 19:19.310
your father
had betrayed you.

19:19.311 --> 19:22.279
I know what my father did.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.214
I lived through it.

19:24.215 --> 19:25.515
You survived.

19:25.516 --> 19:26.816
It made you stronger.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.318
Cara, I don't want
to talk about it.

19:32.222 --> 19:34.556
I'm sorry,

19:34.557 --> 19:35.891
I didn't mean to snap at you.

19:35.892 --> 19:38.126
I'm just...

19:38.127 --> 19:39.927
very tired.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.229
(Richard)
<i>You're exhausted.</i>

19:41.230 --> 19:43.130
( grunts )

19:43.131 --> 19:44.665
We need to stop and rest.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.566
You're only trying to stall
our journey to give

19:46.567 --> 19:48.067
your friends time to
break the spell.

19:48.068 --> 19:50.169
If we keep going without rest,
we won't be able to fight

19:50.170 --> 19:52.271
the Sisters
when they attack again.

19:52.272 --> 19:53.939
( thunder rumbling )

19:55.841 --> 19:57.208
It's going to rain soon.

19:57.209 --> 19:59.844
If we spend the night
at the tavern we passed,

19:59.845 --> 20:01.378
by the time we set out
in the morning,

20:01.379 --> 20:03.747
the rain will have
washed away our tracks.

20:07.051 --> 20:09.552
Are you warm enough?

20:09.553 --> 20:12.121
I'm sure Kahlan's very cozy.

20:12.122 --> 20:14.456
But if I get a chill,
I'll let you know.

20:14.457 --> 20:16.624
I'm going to see
if somebody in the tavern

20:16.625 --> 20:18.493
will sell us some horses.

21:12.841 --> 21:13.974
You all right?

21:15.943 --> 21:17.343
I'm fine.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.247
Just a little dizzy.

21:21.248 --> 21:23.882
( crowd chattering )

21:26.618 --> 21:28.352
Barkeep.

21:31.088 --> 21:34.188
Get the lady
another glass of wine.

21:38.121 --> 21:39.556
This is the spot.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.666
Can you hold this?
It's heavy.

21:54.503 --> 21:56.337
Just hurry.

( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

22:00.642 --> 22:02.075
( chuckles )

22:04.512 --> 22:05.711
Hit me.

22:07.147 --> 22:09.382
You heard me.

22:09.383 --> 22:10.616
If that's what you want.

what the lady asked.

You spoiled all my fun.

Why?

You went back
to help those farmers

even though I told you
not to, didn't you?

24:21.088 --> 24:25.257
Now you know the consequences
of disobeying me.

24:25.258 --> 24:28.727
If you do it again,
Kahlan will pay the price.

24:35.133 --> 24:39.301
You have Kahlan's blood
on your hands, Richard.

24:39.302 --> 24:41.536
But perhaps you'd like
to make it up to her.

24:41.537 --> 24:44.338
Hm?

24:44.339 --> 24:46.874
We can make her feel better.

25:05.624 --> 25:06.991
Kahlan,
are you all right?

25:06.992 --> 25:08.458
I think it's over.

25:08.459 --> 25:10.661
Do you need to rest?

25:10.662 --> 25:12.429
No.

25:12.430 --> 25:14.997
I feel a little better now.

25:14.998 --> 25:16.899
That should help
the swelling.

25:20.703 --> 25:22.670
I used to take care
of people too.

25:22.671 --> 25:24.704
It's true.

25:24.705 --> 25:26.039
When I was a young novice,

25:26.040 --> 25:28.106
all I wanted to do
was serve the Creator

25:28.107 --> 25:30.908
and become a Sister
of the Light.

25:30.909 --> 25:32.342
To prove I was worthy,

25:32.343 --> 25:34.777
I volunteered to go
on a service mission

25:34.778 --> 25:36.612
and give aid and comfort
to men in prison.

25:38.516 --> 25:41.353
There was one prisoner,

25:41.354 --> 25:43.689
he liked
to hear me sing hymns.

25:43.690 --> 25:46.224
He asked to pray
with me, alone,

25:46.225 --> 25:49.727
and I told the guard
it would be all right.

25:49.728 --> 25:53.229
As soon as he left,

25:53.230 --> 25:55.697
the man
forced himself on me.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.702
I went back to the Prelate
and told her what had happened.

26:01.703 --> 26:04.204
I admitted
I wanted to kill the man.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.741
But the Prelate said
the Creator had given me

26:07.742 --> 26:09.710
a great opportunity

26:09.711 --> 26:12.512
to grant the sacred gift
of forgiveness.

26:20.324 --> 26:21.791
What did you do?

26:23.127 --> 26:25.762
I went back
and tried to forgive him.

26:25.763 --> 26:29.832
I prayed to the Creator to
let the light shine through me,

26:29.833 --> 26:34.603
but the man forced himself
on me again.

26:34.604 --> 26:36.670
I was so ashamed.

26:36.671 --> 26:38.772
I didn't want to tell
the Prelate that I had failed.

26:38.773 --> 26:40.974
But that night,

26:40.975 --> 26:43.275
when I went to sleep,

26:43.276 --> 26:47.744
I dreamed of slicing
his throat with my dacra.

26:47.745 --> 26:50.280
And I knew that was a message
from the Keeper.

26:50.281 --> 26:53.916
A promise that if I served him,
he would protect me.

26:53.917 --> 26:57.251
So the next day,
I went back,

26:57.252 --> 27:00.921
and I slit
the prisoner's throat.

27:00.922 --> 27:04.658
That was the last
rotten breath he ever took.

27:04.659 --> 27:08.527
I didn't feel a shred of guilt
or horror at what I'd done.

27:08.528 --> 27:10.763
All I felt was powerful.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.566
And that's when I knew
I had truly become a Sister.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.535
A Sister of the Dark.

27:22.105 --> 27:23.705
What happened to you
was wrong.

27:23.706 --> 27:25.673
The whole world
is wrong.

27:25.674 --> 27:28.341
That's why the Keeper
wants to end it.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.676
And I thank him every day

27:29.677 --> 27:31.677
for giving me
the strength to help him.

27:33.412 --> 27:36.817
Nicci, you are strong.

27:36.818 --> 27:38.585
But I don't believe
a person's strength

27:38.586 --> 27:41.921
comes from the Keeper
or the Creator.

27:41.922 --> 27:45.290
Your strength is yours
and yours alone.

27:45.291 --> 27:48.860
And what you do with it
is up to you.

27:58.435 --> 28:01.338
I was sure
once I saw her things

28:01.339 --> 28:03.506
that I'd remember,

28:03.507 --> 28:05.008
but I don't even know
which are hers,

28:05.009 --> 28:07.811
let alone which ones meant
anything to her.

28:09.611 --> 28:11.677
When I was under confession,

28:11.678 --> 28:15.210
I bought this for your mother
in celebration of your birth.

28:18.482 --> 28:19.982
And I got her
these earrings to match

28:19.983 --> 28:22.317
when your sister was born.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.884
Your mother wore them
every day.

28:28.818 --> 28:31.350
I can't believe
I forgot.

28:31.351 --> 28:35.251
Maybe there are other things
you don't remember.

28:35.252 --> 28:38.187
I remember enough.

28:38.188 --> 28:40.788
Like when we used to
have lunch together?

28:40.789 --> 28:43.089
And you liked it
when I would cut your apples

28:43.090 --> 28:45.058
in the shapes of stars.

28:45.059 --> 28:47.594
And then I would lift you up

28:47.595 --> 28:49.395
to feed the cores to the horses.

28:52.332 --> 28:55.467
You only did that
because you were confessed.

28:55.468 --> 28:56.668
You're right.

28:56.669 --> 28:58.636
I didn't choose
to be with your mother

28:58.637 --> 29:00.838
or to have children.
I was forced.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.641
You've spent three days subject
to the whims of your sorceress.

29:05.642 --> 29:07.910
I spent six years
confessed to your mother.

29:07.911 --> 29:11.747
Confessors don't choose
honorable men as mates.

29:11.748 --> 29:13.315
So you're saying I deserved it?

29:15.551 --> 29:16.885
Hm.

29:19.254 --> 29:20.621
Look at this.

29:20.622 --> 29:21.689
( sighs )

29:24.425 --> 29:27.328
Her name was Leah.

29:27.329 --> 29:29.096
I made this for her.

29:29.097 --> 29:32.132
Her father was
a stone carver.

29:32.133 --> 29:34.468
And when I asked
for her hand in marriage,

29:34.469 --> 29:36.836
he offered to teach me
everything he knew.

29:38.338 --> 29:40.005
I took to stone carving
right away.

29:40.006 --> 29:41.739
I'd found my calling.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.241
What happened?

29:43.242 --> 29:44.608
My father.

29:44.609 --> 29:47.411
No son of his was
going to be a stone carver.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.546
Or married to
the daughter of one.

29:49.547 --> 29:52.649
Oh, he had more
ambitious plans for me.

29:52.650 --> 29:55.619
He got me a commission
in the Dragon Corps.

29:57.322 --> 29:59.489
I couldn't wait until
my service was finished,

29:59.490 --> 30:02.358
so that I could get back
to what I loved.

30:02.359 --> 30:03.826
But before I could,

30:03.827 --> 30:05.793
your mother confessed me
in battle.

30:10.865 --> 30:12.198
Whatever happened to you,

30:12.199 --> 30:14.800
it doesn't justify
what you did to us.

30:14.801 --> 30:17.001
For years
I was terrified

30:17.002 --> 30:19.735
of what you were going
to force us to do next.

30:21.170 --> 30:23.570
Dennee cried every night,

30:23.571 --> 30:25.238
and I couldn't even comfort her

30:25.239 --> 30:28.074
because you had bound our hands.

30:31.243 --> 30:34.211
There's no excuse
for what I did.

30:34.212 --> 30:37.681
But you should know that
as afraid as you were of me,

30:37.682 --> 30:39.749
I was even more afraid
of both of you.

30:42.086 --> 30:44.387
Knowing that with one touch,

30:44.388 --> 30:48.591
my own children had
the power to destroy me again.

30:56.164 --> 30:58.064
You found something?

30:59.799 --> 31:01.632
Her necklace.

31:02.867 --> 31:05.534
Now all we need is sunlight.

31:05.535 --> 31:07.803
The spell won't work without it.

31:07.804 --> 31:10.905
It'll just be
a few more hours now.

31:10.906 --> 31:13.106
I'll get more wood
for the fire.

31:17.712 --> 31:19.646
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

31:41.664 --> 31:43.565
( gasps )
( gasps )

31:46.001 --> 31:47.101
( stomps )

31:48.303 --> 31:49.970
That was no ordinary spider.

31:49.971 --> 31:52.338
It was sent by the Sisters
of the Dark.

31:52.339 --> 31:55.174
I only have a few hours left,
at most.

31:55.175 --> 31:56.911
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

31:59.817 --> 32:01.484
We need to get you
to a healer. Now.

32:01.485 --> 32:04.285
There's only one thing that
can save me from this poison.

32:04.286 --> 32:06.754
The nectar
of the Midnight Blossom.

32:06.755 --> 32:08.390
It only grows
in complete darkness

32:08.391 --> 32:09.759
in the Caves of Arborea.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.262
We passed those caves yesterday.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.464
It can't be coincidence
that the one thing we need

32:13.465 --> 32:16.134
to save your life
is so close.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.401
It's a trap.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.504
The Sisters will be waiting
for us.

32:20.505 --> 32:21.872
If they wanted you dead,

32:21.873 --> 32:23.276
why not just use
a stronger poison?

32:23.277 --> 32:25.112
They want me to go to the caves
so they can kill me

32:25.113 --> 32:26.482
with their dacras
and steal my han.

32:26.483 --> 32:27.717
We don't have
a choice.

32:27.718 --> 32:30.019
If you don't get that flower,
you'll die.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.620
And so will Kahlan.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.528
(Cara)
You'll be fine once
the spell is removed.

32:41.529 --> 32:43.863
It's Richard
I'm worried about.

32:43.864 --> 32:45.531
Once the spell is broken,

32:45.532 --> 32:47.966
Nicci will be able
to use her magic.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.001
Richard can handle Nicci.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.902
This should help
with the swelling.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.237
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

32:54.238 --> 32:55.638
Can you speed it up,
Wizard?

32:58.474 --> 33:00.475
(Kahlan)
If I die,

33:00.476 --> 33:03.942
make sure Richard knows
it wasn't his fault.

33:05.345 --> 33:08.315
(Cara)
You're not going to die.

33:08.316 --> 33:09.984
No! Kahlan.

33:09.985 --> 33:11.253
(Richard)
<i>Hold on, Nicci.</i>

33:11.254 --> 33:14.189
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

33:32.838 --> 33:35.072
Damn it, Nicci, fight!

33:44.113 --> 33:47.248
Come on, stay with me.
Come on.

33:48.650 --> 33:51.419
Don't do this, don't give up!

34:02.795 --> 34:04.162
( sobbing )

34:10.935 --> 34:12.735
( sobbing )

34:15.706 --> 34:18.308
Kahlan, I'm right here.

34:20.478 --> 34:21.945
I love you so much.

34:21.946 --> 34:24.913
(Richard voice echoing )
<i>I love you so much.</i>

34:24.914 --> 34:26.648
Can you hear me, Kahlan?

34:26.649 --> 34:28.315
I love you.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.552
Can you feel this?

34:37.257 --> 34:38.391
And this?

34:38.393 --> 34:41.627
( <i>tender theme playing</i> )

34:44.163 --> 34:45.797
And this?

34:53.004 --> 34:54.304
I love you.

35:00.645 --> 35:01.813
( gasps )

35:06.151 --> 35:07.418
You're alive.

Kahlan?

35:12.486 --> 35:13.919
(Richard)
<i>Can you stand?</i>

35:13.920 --> 35:15.520
I think so.

( blade clangs )

35:18.790 --> 35:19.923
( both gasp )

35:21.861 --> 35:23.495
They're here.

35:24.697 --> 35:26.932
(Richard)
They're trying to smoke us out.

35:26.933 --> 35:28.801
We need your magic
to fight them.

35:28.802 --> 35:30.671
Break the Maternity Spell.

35:30.672 --> 35:31.905
Even if I wanted to,

35:31.906 --> 35:33.907
I don't have time
or the ingredients.

Mama?

35:53.888 --> 35:57.024
My beautiful Kahlan.

35:58.425 --> 36:00.259
There's so much

36:00.260 --> 36:02.494
that I want to tell you,

36:02.495 --> 36:03.828
that I want to ask you.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.329
Kahlan, this won't last
much longer,

36:05.330 --> 36:06.597
you need to touch hands.

36:10.068 --> 36:12.769
( <i>tender theme playing</i> )

36:17.041 --> 36:19.142
From the day you were born,

36:19.143 --> 36:21.877
I knew your destiny
would be extraordinary.

36:24.012 --> 36:26.280
Mother, I'm not strong enough.

36:27.716 --> 36:29.150
I need you.

36:29.151 --> 36:31.918
Even when you were
a little girl,

36:31.919 --> 36:34.955
5za guide as I could ever be.

36:37.924 --> 36:40.625
I'm so proud of you,
Kahlan.

36:41.893 --> 36:43.060
Please don't go.

is in Nicci's hands now.

Prophecy says
you'll find the Stone

38:34.488 --> 38:37.155
and give it to
the Enemy of the Light.

the Keeper alive than dead.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.369

39:02.412 --> 39:04.579
Thank you for getting me
out of prison.

had your reasons.

An honest one.

to become a stone carver.

I'll keep this,
and I'll do as you said.

the Mother Confessor told me to.

about the Keeper.

42:00.623 --> 42:02.824
And since it appears
you still run his errands,

perhaps you could deliver
