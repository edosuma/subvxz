"ice road truckers"...

00:05.339 --> 00:06.605

00:06.607 --> 00:09.041
Hopefully something like this
is not gonna happen to me.

00:09.977 --> 00:12.678
- There ain't no way I'm getting
turned around anywhere.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.213
Narrator: Hard choices...

00:14.215 --> 00:16.115

00:16.117 --> 00:17.916
Whoa.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.618
Narrator: And big risks.....

00:19.620 --> 00:21.020
Lisa: I have no steering.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.688
So I gotta start it now
or never.

wilderness...

01:11.439 --> 01:15.040

gonna have a short season
this year.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.642

owner's

01:16.644 --> 01:20.112
Racing against the clock
and mother nature.

like this before up here.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.254
Narrator: Darrell ward scored
20 tons of supplies

01:29.256 --> 01:32.491
For a school being built
in the town of pikangikum.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.863
But the 200 mile trail is in
danger of being shut down

01:37.865 --> 01:41.033
Due to rising temperatures.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.334
Darrell: They don't know
whether the roads open

01:42.336 --> 01:44.036
Or closed half the time.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.672
You might run towards
your winter road,

01:46.674 --> 01:47.840
But when you get
to the winter road

01:47.842 --> 01:49.842
You find a road closed sign.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.577
It's not safe,
they close the road.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.213
Narrator: This early
in the season

01:54.215 --> 01:56.615
Warm temperatures are a rarity.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.585
But this year el nino
is wreaking havoc

01:59.587 --> 02:01.920
For the ice road truckers.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.755
To keep the winter roads
in tact

02:03.757 --> 02:06.925
Temperatures must be minus
six degrees celsius

02:06.927 --> 02:09.595
Or lower to remain open.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.831
If the thermometer raises
to minus five or above

02:12.833 --> 02:15.801
The route could be closed
by road authorities.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.105
Darrell: I got six below zero
this morning

02:22.510 --> 02:24.276
So I don't know
from hour to hour

02:24.278 --> 02:26.245
Whether these roads are gonna
be open or closed.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.083
Narrator: At minus six
darrell's right on the cusp.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.620
Darrell: We're gonna have
to have some major changes

02:34.622 --> 02:36.054
In the weather.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.110
Has it been closed today,
do you know?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.357
All right. Ten four.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.666
That's kind of (bleep) up.

03:22.269 --> 03:25.103
Narrator: The path ahead
has been shut down...

03:29.043 --> 03:32.511
So darrell's got no choice
but to wait it out.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.949

03:38.219 --> 03:40.352
Darrell: This company's
survival

03:40.354 --> 03:43.455
Depends on loads being
delivered on time.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.258
I'm afraid that we won't get
the loads in

03:46.260 --> 03:48.460
That we need to survive
the season.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.395
This company could go down.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.432
I don't know.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.100

50 miles to the northwest...

Art: This is my little good
luck pouch here.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.318
It's supposed to keep me safe.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.721
I was given that by a cree
friend of mine.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.956
I rub that every day.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.659

for luck

04:22.930 --> 04:24.363
Art: Away we go again.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.201

to remote st. Theresa point.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.603

04:31.605 --> 04:35.307
Art: Be nice to get a trip
without anything going (bleep),
eh?

04:35.309 --> 04:37.609
Like one trip is all I ask,
you know.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.780
Narrator: The load of building
supplies

04:41.782 --> 04:44.316
Could bring in a fortune
for polar.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.054
But the dangerous routes
rumored to be in rough shape.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.623
- It's getting warmer now.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.091
I don't know.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.528
Well, well, well, well, well.

Hey, there big truck,
you got a copy, buddy.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.333
Trucker: (on radio) yeah.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.634
- You didn't come out
of st. Theresa's

05:02.636 --> 05:04.369
By any chance, did ya?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.572
- Right on, buddy.
How was the road?

05:14.915 --> 05:17.049
- Now isn't that (bleep)
something.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.654
(truck rumbles)

05:25.492 --> 05:27.159
(big thud)

05:29.063 --> 05:30.929
The road is getting worse
and worse.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.699
Look at this.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.033
That's the top of the muskeg
coming up

05:35.035 --> 05:36.902
Through the (bleep) snow, eh.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.837
(truck rumbles)

05:38.839 --> 05:41.206
Like this should be all covered
with snow this time of year.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.874
This is no good.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.747
This is a bad spot here, b'y.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.984
(truck rumbles)

05:52.986 --> 05:54.720
I wouldn't wanna (bleep) up

Wow! Check this out, buddy.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.715
Holy (bleep), eh.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.518
Look at all the chains marks,
man.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.987
Whenever they were trying
to pull this out, look.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.890
Everything tore all to hell.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.725
(wind gusts)

06:33.727 --> 06:35.961
Holy god, eh.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.401
Narrator: The thawing muskeg
can act like quick sand

06:43.437 --> 06:46.471
Forcing drivers to flee
and abandon their trucks

06:46.473 --> 06:49.040
Hundreds of miles
from the nearest town.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.881
And this road's so ravaged
even maintenance vehicles

06:55.883 --> 06:58.283
Aren't immune to the trails
wrath.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.952
- You break through
that road run,

07:00.954 --> 07:03.722
You'll go right to your (bleep)
arse just like this, look.

07:08.362 --> 07:10.595

There's none of this call help

07:16.503 --> 07:18.570
Or any of this kind of (bleep),
b'y.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.939
We screw up we might not get
to do it again.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.580
Hopefully something like this
is not gonna happen to me.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.323
(truck door opens and shuts)

07:52.239 --> 07:54.039
What can I say...

07:55.409 --> 07:57.375
Away we go again.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.546
(truck engine hums)

08:09.656 --> 08:12.691

it'll be a good (bleep) day.

man.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.528

a busted $60,000 loader

08:56.436 --> 08:58.803
400 miles from remote
garden hill

08:58.805 --> 09:01.172
Down to winnipeg for repairs.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.675
Lisa: I like back hauls

09:03.677 --> 09:06.411
It means that I'm making double
the money on the same run.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.446
So that's pretty exciting.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.017
Narrator: A high price job will
bring in much needed cash

09:12.019 --> 09:13.818

The road's falling apart.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.065
So I just need to get out
of here.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.002
Narrator: But the road's
deteriorating fast

09:31.004 --> 09:34.673
And within hours is expected
to get shut down.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.309

10:33.634 --> 10:35.166

10:37.938 --> 10:39.604
So I gotta get out

10:51.218 --> 10:53.785
Is never turn off the engine.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.376
Narrator: If the load goes
undelivered

14:05.378 --> 14:09.180
Not only will the village
go without the supplies...

14:09.182 --> 14:11.449
The young company will take
a big financial hit

14:11.451 --> 14:13.618
It can't afford.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.354
Darrell: We'll do whatever
it takes

14:16.356 --> 14:18.456
To overcome this obstacle.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.425
The company and the communities

14:20.427 --> 14:22.961
Depend on these loads being
delivered.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.564
So I'm gonna have to get going.

14:28.301 --> 14:32.370
Narrator: But the veteran
trucker's got a trick up
his sleeve.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.039
- This is my first trip of
the year into pikangikum.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.741
I was in here last year

14:36.743 --> 14:38.810
And I remember coming out
of there before

14:38.812 --> 14:41.446
And there was a short cut road.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.014
Narrator: With the main road
closed

14:43.016 --> 14:44.916
A potential alternate route

14:44.918 --> 14:48.453
Just be the key to reaching
the community.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.754
Darrell: I'm gonna turn off
here shortly.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.823
I know my corner's coming up

14:51.825 --> 14:54.392
So I'm gonna find
the corner here

14:54.394 --> 14:58.529
And pull around the corner
and check it out.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.666
Yep, this would be the road
I'm taking.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.473
Narrator: But the shortcut isn't
part of the winter road system

15:08.475 --> 15:12.176
And is completely unmaintained
by road authorities.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.615
- I don't know what
to think of my road.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.484
(truck rattling)

15:19.486 --> 15:20.952
But it don't look like
there's been any trucks

15:20.954 --> 15:22.954
On this road this year.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.190
I'm hoping that it gets me
out of here.

15:26.192 --> 15:29.560
Hope I didn't get myself in
a spot I don't want to be in.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.596
Pretty sketchy road.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.831
(truck rattling, thud)

15:36.069 --> 15:38.069
(truck creaking)

15:38.071 --> 15:41.105
Whoa. Roads are rough
on the body.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.945
Whoa! There are tree branches
sticking out.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.814
(crunch)

15:49.816 --> 15:52.317
(bleep). There goes my antennas
probably.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.154
Wow. Wow.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.324
This is not very good.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.259
(truck rattling)

16:02.662 --> 16:04.295
(truck creaking)

16:04.297 --> 16:07.131
There ain't no way I'm getting
turned around anywhere

16:07.133 --> 16:10.134
And there's no way that I'm
backing back through that spot

16:10.136 --> 16:11.903
I just came through.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.540
I'm totally (bleep)
if I have to turn around.

16:16.710 --> 16:20.144
(truck engine roars)

16:20.146 --> 16:21.679
Darrell: Now I'm afraid there's
gonna end up

16:21.681 --> 16:24.082
Being some (bleep) up spot
in the road up here

16:24.084 --> 16:25.717
That I can't get through.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.286
If that happens...

16:28.288 --> 16:29.420
Well...

16:30.357 --> 16:32.623
I got myself in a (bleep) jam.

16:32.625 --> 16:37.462
Narrator: The private trail's
punishing darrell in his truck
at every turn.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.863
(truck rattling)

16:40.100 --> 16:43.434
- (bleep) this road's even
getting narrower.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.769
Narrator: And up ahead...

16:44.771 --> 16:45.903
Darrell: Oh-oh.

16:45.905 --> 16:49.741
I've really gotten myself
in a (bleep) situation.

16:49.743 --> 16:52.543
Narrator: It's got a big
surprise.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.245
Darrell: Holy (bleep).

16:55.515 --> 16:57.115
Narrator: The crossing
at the trails edge

16:57.117 --> 16:58.983
Stretches nearly three miles

17:01.221 --> 17:03.554
And entering from an unused
access point

17:04.691 --> 17:07.592
Darrell has no way of knowing
if the ice is strong enough

17:07.594 --> 17:10.228
To support his 20 ton load.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.930
(wind howls)

17:15.902 --> 17:17.502
(footsteps crunch in the snow)

17:17.504 --> 17:19.670
- Can't see the ice.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.406
Packed full of snow.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.610
(ice cracking)

17:31.651 --> 17:33.351
Makes you wonder why you're
here doing this (bleep)

17:33.353 --> 17:34.719
When you look out across that

17:34.721 --> 17:36.954
And you know you gotta drive
across it.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.994
I don't have time to sit here

17:42.996 --> 17:45.396
And look for cracks in the ice.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.405
(truck door shuts)

17:54.407 --> 17:56.841
There ain't no turning
around now.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.646
So I guess it's now or never.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.689
Naator: On the pikangikum
lake ice crossing...

18:12.859 --> 18:14.725
- There ain't no turning
around now.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.130
So I guess it's now or never.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.600
Narrator: Darrell ward's
risking it all.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.870
Darrell: Ugh! Coming down
onto the ice.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.738
Narrator: Trying to deliver
a vital haul

18:27.740 --> 18:30.908
And keep his young company
from going under.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.945
- Put my window down
and see what kind of

18:33.947 --> 18:36.080
Cracking noise I get anyway.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.648
(ice cracking)

18:38.751 --> 18:41.152
Whoa, a lot of cracks.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.456
When I walked up
I didn't find any

18:45.458 --> 18:47.792
But boy, once you get out there
you can see 'em.

18:49.028 --> 18:54.398
(ice cracking)

18:54.400 --> 18:56.033
I can see where there's
water's squished up

18:56.035 --> 18:57.802
Through the ice cracks
right here.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.470
The different color
of the ice

18:59.472 --> 19:03.040
From the water pushing up
through the cracks.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.842
It's pretty thin.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.011
(ice cracking)

19:09.549 --> 19:12.316
Kind of creepy feeling looking
at all the cracks in this ice.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.451
I don't know how it holds
together

19:13.453 --> 19:15.586
When it's got all these
cracks in it.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.922
It would suck for this thing
to go down.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.863
Woo! Dunno. Yeah, there's a big
ol' crack down the middle.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.965
That ice is moving.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.338
I can see water over here on
this edge of the ice crossing.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.609
(bleep)! I don't like that.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.345
Makes me nervous.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.881
Maybe get across this ice.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.487
Coming off the ice,
back onto land.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.623
(truck engine hums)

19:53.560 --> 19:55.927
Success on that crossing.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.962
I am now at pikangikum.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.165
Narrator: Thanks to darrell's
bold call...

20:01.167 --> 20:02.633
- Now if I can get unloaded

20:02.635 --> 20:05.002
And get of here
I'll be in good shape.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.771
Narrator: ...Taking the unused
shortcut

20:06.773 --> 20:08.773
Proves to be the right move.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.944
- Right on! Well, you'll drop
it and I'm out of here.

20:12.946 --> 20:17.248
Narrator: And the renegade
company pockets a big paycheck.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.550
- With el nino
the days have been warm.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.853
It's gotta be colder
to go on these roads.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.256
I didn't know if I was gonna
make it.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.390
What am I to do?

20:26.392 --> 20:28.526
Once I committed myself
I kept going,

20:28.528 --> 20:30.461
And, you know, luckily,
today I made it.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.266
Narrator: While darrell turns
and burns,

20:35.268 --> 20:37.201
100 miles to the northwest,

20:38.638 --> 20:41.305
On the remote trail
out of garden hill...

20:42.475 --> 20:44.709
Lisa: I don't know. I don't
know why it won't start.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.578
Narrator: His business partner
still can't get moving.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.449
- Stupid truck.
Why won't you start now?

20:51.451 --> 20:54.986
Narrator: After breaking
the cardinal rule
of the winter roads:

20:54.988 --> 20:57.255
Never turn off your engine.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.490
Her motor hasn't started
back up.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.028
- See that's the thing,
that's like, okay,

21:04.030 --> 21:05.529
So it's not running right

21:05.531 --> 21:07.965
So you turn it off to make
sure it's running right

21:07.967 --> 21:10.067
And then it doesn't start
at all.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.738
I mean, I took a gamble
and lost on this one.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.707
Narrator: Hundreds of miles
from help

21:16.709 --> 21:20.578
It's up to lisa to figure out
a way to get back on the road

21:20.580 --> 21:23.147
Or face being stranded
through the night

21:24.217 --> 21:26.250
Or even for days.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.353
- I don't know what
my options are.

21:32.225 --> 21:34.425
Whether you're a mechanic or
not you're still a mechanic.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.661
A lot of imagination
and creativity

21:36.663 --> 21:39.497
Has to go into fixing things

21:39.499 --> 21:41.565
Cause there's no one there
to help you.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.301
(wind gusts)

21:46.572 --> 21:48.572
I bet I could bump start
the truck.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.044
I don't even know if it's
enough hill to get it started.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.912
I'm gonna try though.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.915
Narrator: A bump start
or push start

21:57.917 --> 22:00.718
Is a way to starting a vehicle
by using momentum

22:00.720 --> 22:02.720
To turn an engine back on.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.790
Once the brake's released

22:05.792 --> 22:09.293
Gravity begins rolling
the truck downhill.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.962
The driver then attempts
to start the engine,

22:11.964 --> 22:13.964
Putting the truck in gear.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.304
(door shuts)

22:20.306 --> 22:22.306
- So put it in neutral.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.544
Once the brake comes off
it should start rolling.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.747
Ready? I'm gonna try this.

22:31.217 --> 22:41.225
♪♪♪

22:41.227 --> 22:42.793
(truck whines)

22:43.896 --> 22:46.097
Okay. I'm rolling.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.631
(chains clink)

22:47.633 --> 22:56.173
♪♪♪

22:56.175 --> 22:58.042
I don't have any steering.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.177
Like seriously I can't turn
the wheel at all.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.379
(chains clink)

23:01.381 --> 23:04.148
Oh man this is gonna be bad
if it doesn't work.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.453
I gotta start it now or never.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.356
(truck engine clanking)

23:14.861 --> 23:17.228
Come on, baby, you can do it.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.796
(chains clink)

23:22.201 --> 23:23.968
(truck engine roars)

23:26.472 --> 23:28.472
Ah! There!

23:28.474 --> 23:30.141
(truck engine hums)

23:32.145 --> 23:34.211
Oh my gosh, it worked.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.947
Put it in fifth,
push the clutch in,

23:36.949 --> 23:39.316
Roll down the hill,
pop the clutch

23:39.318 --> 23:41.085
And away, the engine starts up.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.788
Wooo! (laughs)

23:45.425 --> 23:46.690
Just gotta make tracks
for winnipeg.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.426
I gotta go fast and hard.

23:49.395 --> 23:52.363
Let's get out of here before
anything else happens.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.137
Narrator: Throughout the winter
road system

24:00.139 --> 24:03.174
More trails are finally opening.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.212
Narrator: But with temperatures
changing rapidly...

24:08.214 --> 24:10.047
(water splashing)

24:11.784 --> 24:15.419
The window of opportunity
could be shorter than ever.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.093
So at polar industries
in winnipeg...

24:24.430 --> 24:26.230
Mark: All right, steph, so...

24:26.232 --> 24:27.565
I know you want to hit
the ice roads,

24:27.567 --> 24:30.901
But we gotta put you through
a few tests here today.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.002
Narrator: Boss,
mark kohaykewych,

24:32.004 --> 24:34.271
Is looking to act fast

24:34.273 --> 24:37.074
By taking on a new driver.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.576
Mark: I'm gonna put steph
to the test here

24:38.578 --> 24:41.278
And see if she's got what it
takes to be an ice road trucker.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.349
- Hi I'm steph. Heard you're
looking for drivers.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.418
Narrator: 22-year-old
stephanie custance,

24:47.420 --> 24:50.955
Came to polar aiming to get
a job on the ice.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.056
- You got experience:

24:52.058 --> 24:53.524
- I'm very new.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.292
Narrator: To see if she could
cut it...

24:55.294 --> 24:57.194
Steph: No-no-no-no, no, no, no.

24:57.196 --> 25:00.364
Narrator: Mark put her through
a series of challenges.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.800
(crunch)
mark: Oh, that's not good.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.269
- Oh.
- Ugh.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.839
All right, hop in the truck
let's go.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.908
Narrator: Now it's her final
test,

25:10.910 --> 25:14.411
Prove what she's got behind
the wheel on the local roads.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.547
Steph: I'm nervous.

25:16.549 --> 25:19.116
My test drive with mark
will be my first time ever

25:19.118 --> 25:21.285
Even on the highway
in the winter.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.754
So I'm just praying that
I got enough wits about me

25:23.756 --> 25:25.322
To do this right.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.757
Narrator: Over the years...

25:26.759 --> 25:28.692
(truck honks)
man: Watch out. Watch out.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.060
Woman: Oh!

25:30.997 --> 25:32.429
Oh, my god.

25:32.431 --> 25:33.898
Man: All right, you're done
driving.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.535
Narrator: ...Rookies have
notoriously struggled on
the ice roads.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.703
- The (bleep) you gotta go
through up here.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.338
I've just about had it.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.042
Narrator: And it's proven too
much for many a trucker.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.579
Boss: I have to cut our losses
and cut our risk.

25:48.581 --> 25:51.882
I guess what I'm thinking,
pork chop,

25:51.884 --> 25:54.218
Is that we'll get you sent
back home.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.888
- All right, steph,
let's go hit the road.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.190
Narrator: With polar under
the gun

26:00.192 --> 26:03.661
Mark can't afford to send out
a driver who's not ready.

26:04.664 --> 26:07.464
Mark: I'm gonna take you
on a couple of back country
roads here.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.367
Put you through your paces,
see what you can do.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.604
How does it feel so far?

26:13.606 --> 26:16.807
- I'm nervous
but I'm, I feel okay.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.243
I've never had to drive
on icy highway before.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.245
(gears grinding)

26:21.247 --> 26:23.480
Mark: Watch your shifting there.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.516
(gears grinding)

26:25.518 --> 26:27.318
Mark: Oh, you're killing
my gears.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.486
Get that shifting down
a little bit.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.789
Can't be screwing up shifts
on the winter road.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.758
(truck engine hums)

26:36.495 --> 26:38.462
- Let's get you turning
right here,

26:38.464 --> 26:40.764
And we're gonna get down
one of the quarry roads.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.766
I'm gonna get you to try
a couple things there.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.137
I want you to go up a little
bit of a hill here.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.872
I want you to stop right here.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.008
- Right here?
- Yep.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.276
- Okay.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.280
- Okay, now start now
that we're midway up.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.982
- Now start?
- Yep.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.551
(engine roars)

27:00.553 --> 27:02.152
- I'm like not going forward
though.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.188
- Exactly. Not that easy, is it?

27:05.524 --> 27:07.891
Gotta put you through
the test.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.193
This is just a baby hill

27:09.195 --> 27:10.961
Compared to what you're going
to see on the winter roads.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.030
- Come on, baby, come on, baby.

27:13.032 --> 27:13.964
(tires spinning)

27:13.966 --> 27:15.633
Mark: Ease on the gas,
easy on the gas.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.202
You don't want to be spinning.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.438
Steph: We're almost there.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.643
Mark: There you go.
- Ha.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.711
- Good job.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.346
- Woo.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.015
Mark: That's nothing compared
to what you're gonna get faced
with, all right.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.116
- Okay.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.087
Mark: All right, steph,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.525
Have you done some off-roading
in a quad before?

27:41.527 --> 27:42.726
- Yeah, in a quad.

27:42.728 --> 27:44.028
- You want to do it
in a truck?

27:44.030 --> 27:49.099
- Yes.
- Head down the power line,
see what you can do.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.070
- This is what you're going
to be doing.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.305
You're literally going to be
off-roading with a semi truck.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.575
Steph: Holy (bleep)!

28:00.012 --> 28:02.780
Mark: See this? That's what
you're going to feel

28:02.782 --> 28:06.183
For ten, twelve, fourteen,
sixteen hours a day.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.986
- Does polar have a masseuse
benefits package?

28:10.589 --> 28:13.323
- Get some momentum.
You're gonna get stuck.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.792
(gears grinding)

28:16.195 --> 28:17.895
- I want you to stop right here.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.797
'kay, so here I'm gonna throw
another challenge at you.

28:19.799 --> 28:20.864
So now you've off-roaded forward

28:20.866 --> 28:22.499
Let's see if you can off-road
backwards.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.804
Steph: You want me to back
right out of here?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.205
Mark: I want you to get right
out of here.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.940
Oh, oh you're sliding off
the road.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.342
Careful you got rocks here too.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.045
That's what you're going
to be faced with.

28:36.782 --> 28:37.681
Don't get too carried away.

28:37.683 --> 28:38.816
You're almost out of here.

28:38.818 --> 28:39.917
No need to get faster
and faster.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.552
Just be careful.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.694
- Holy (bleep)!

28:50.696 --> 28:52.396
- Good job.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.064
Nice work.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.300
Let's head 'er back to the shop.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.068
Steph: Woo.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.474
(engine hums)

29:03.476 --> 29:04.942
(airbrakes hiss)

29:05.945 --> 29:08.011
(truck door opens and shuts)

29:15.154 --> 29:17.121
Mark: So...

29:17.123 --> 29:18.589
Some good things and some
not so good things.

29:18.591 --> 29:21.725
I mean, your inexperience shows
for sure, but uh,

29:24.330 --> 29:26.497
I need drivers.
I got a lot of loads to move.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.501
- I know what I want to do.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.436
I want the job
so if you want to...

29:32.438 --> 29:34.271
Mark: Um, let me think
this over.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.973
Come see me in the morning
we'll talk.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.808
- Sounds good. Thank you.
- All right. Take it easy.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.246
Steph: The test was okay,
some hairy spots.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.082
I'm just hoping that I did good
enough that he likes me.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.817
I'll probably just be up
all night waiting,

29:46.819 --> 29:48.619
(laughs) hoping,
thinking about it.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.022
Narrator: While a newcomer
waits for the call

29:52.024 --> 29:54.892
Up to the big leagues...

29:54.894 --> 29:57.060
The sun sets on the north...

29:58.664 --> 30:00.864
And 400 miles from winnipeg

30:02.334 --> 30:05.169
On the road
to st. Theresa point...

30:05.171 --> 30:06.303
(truck rattles)

30:06.305 --> 30:08.806
- (bleep) I didn't see that
coming.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.041
See the (bleep) hole
we went in there?

30:11.043 --> 30:12.142
Wow!

30:12.144 --> 30:14.144
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.246
Narrator: An ice road veteran's

30:16.248 --> 30:19.883
Deep into his toughest mission
of the season.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.218
(truck rattles)

30:24.590 --> 30:26.790
Crazy road going up
and down, up and down,

30:26.792 --> 30:30.060
Twist and turn
and full of potholes.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.995
It's a full moon, b'y.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.866
Yeah, there will be no falling
asleep on this (bleep) road

30:35.868 --> 30:38.335
That's for (bleep) damn sure.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.873
(truck rattles)

30:42.875 --> 30:45.209
Oh-oh, oh-oh. Oh-oh, oh-oh.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.478
(truck creaking)
- whoa, whoa, whoa, (bleep)!

30:50.216 --> 30:52.082
This is (bleep) slippery.

30:52.084 --> 30:56.220
For a second there, I thought
the game was over for the year.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.990
It's a bad road, buddy.

30:59.992 --> 31:03.861
(bleep), scared the (bleep)
gonna pop out of gear.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.729
Narrator: The further art gets

31:05.731 --> 31:08.198
The worse each mile becomes.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.000
(truck rattles)

31:16.909 --> 31:19.509
Art: Isn't this wonderful?

31:19.511 --> 31:22.412
I can hardly wait to get
to the (bleep) end of this.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.090
There we are at an ice crossing.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.928
(truck rattles)

31:39.031 --> 31:40.697
(squeals to a halt)

31:42.801 --> 31:44.701
(airbrakes hiss)

31:44.703 --> 31:46.670
(engine hums)

31:47.873 --> 31:49.806
There's a mile lake crossing
in between here

31:49.808 --> 31:51.942
And st. Theresa's point.

31:51.944 --> 31:55.045
But I can see the big (bleep)
black spot there.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.083
(footsteps crunch in the snow)

32:00.085 --> 32:01.718
Look at that.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.421
(bleep), b'y, this is gonna be
a (bleep) show.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.591
Narrator: The weather's been
so warm

32:07.593 --> 32:09.826
The ice hasn't frozen
thick enough

32:09.828 --> 32:12.029
To support the weight
of big rigs.

32:13.966 --> 32:16.667
(loud whirring)
- hear the pump?

32:16.669 --> 32:18.235
It's too thin, eh.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.570
They pump water all over,

32:20.572 --> 32:22.272
Let it freeze in the night time.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.308
All that's flooded look.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.681
Narrator: Maintenance crews
flood the surface of crossings

32:30.683 --> 32:33.083
In an effort to garner
thicker ice over night,

32:34.253 --> 32:38.455
But only if the temperature
drops low enough
for it to freeze.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.427
Art: You gonna flood the whole
thing or just one side?

32:45.264 --> 32:46.430
Art: Okay.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.838
(whirring)

32:54.840 --> 32:56.473
Narrator: It's anything
but a sure bet

32:56.475 --> 32:59.476
That the crossing will freeze
solid enough for travel,

32:59.478 --> 33:01.745
But even it does...

33:01.747 --> 33:04.047
- I'm pretty sure that
I'm too heavy to cross it.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.584
Narrator: ...Art could be over
the weight limit.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.053
(slams door)

33:14.660 --> 33:16.893
- They're not gonna let us
cross that.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.062
There's no (bleep) way.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.537
Narrator: As the sun rises
on winnipeg...

33:31.310 --> 33:32.409
Steph: Mark's still making up
his mind.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.678
He's got some thinking
he said he's gonna do.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.447
Narrator: ...It's judgment day
for steph custance.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.583
Steph: I'm really hoping that
I get the opportunity

33:39.585 --> 33:41.451
And I'm also hoping
I don't let him down.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.954
I wanna get out there,
I wanna be an ice road trucker.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.091
- Hey, steph.
- Hey. How's it going?

33:48.093 --> 33:49.760
- Good. Grab a seat.

33:50.929 --> 33:53.063
So, I've seen what you can do.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.498
I've seen the way you drive.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.233
You're definitely green.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.701
You do have a lot of energy.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.902
You do have a lot of enthusiasm

33:58.904 --> 34:00.837
But I don't know
if you fully appreciate

34:00.839 --> 34:03.407
What this job entails.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.309
It's dangerous.
It's a really dangerous job.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.911
Guys get hurt out there.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.247
Truck's breaking down, you
gotta know how to fix it.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.682
I'm not quite sure you cut out
for that just yet.

34:14.019 --> 34:16.720
I-I've been giving this
a lot of thought and uh...

34:22.928 --> 34:24.528
Don't let me down.
I'm gonna give you a shot.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.662
- Yeah.
- All right?

34:25.664 --> 34:27.364
- Awesome, thank you.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.699
- I'm taking a huge risk on her,

34:29.701 --> 34:30.967
But you know what,

34:30.969 --> 34:32.436
We've all gotta start somewhere.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.538
She's got the drive.

34:34.540 --> 34:35.539
She's got something in her

34:35.541 --> 34:38.642
That's gonna make her succeed
out there.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.077
You gotta open your ears
and you gotta watch

34:40.079 --> 34:41.211
And you gotta learn.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.213
- I'm ready.
- Welcome aboard.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.048
- Thank you. Awesome.
- All right? Take care.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.850
- Yeah, you too.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.319
So I met with mark.
It's a huge opportunity.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.654
It's a huge change in my life

34:50.656 --> 34:53.190
And it's gonna be awesome
for my son.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.591
So I'm pumped.

34:56.028 --> 34:58.128
I get to be an ice road
trucker. (laughs)

34:58.130 --> 34:59.729
I'm excited.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.033
Woo, ha, ha!

35:03.035 --> 35:06.203
Narrator: As steph joins
the polar squad,

35:07.739 --> 35:09.739
400 miles to the south...

35:11.410 --> 35:13.710
(art murmuring)
subtract. 34. 139.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.444
34. 139.

35:17.015 --> 35:19.082
Narrator: After a long night
in the truck

35:19.084 --> 35:22.786
The company wild card's
weighing his odds.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.454
- I'm trying to figure out
how many pieces

35:24.456 --> 35:26.857
I got on the back of the truck
and what they weigh

35:26.859 --> 35:29.759
So I can figure out if I'm,
if I can cross this ice or not

35:29.761 --> 35:32.762
Cause if I screw this up
we're gonna get drowned.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.765
(footsteps crunch in the snow)

35:37.236 --> 35:39.536
Look at the (bleep) crack.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.538
They flooded this last night,
eh.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.806
(whirring)

35:42.808 --> 35:45.375
They pump water all over let it
freeze in the night time.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.310
All that's flooded look.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.846
Narrator: The crossing was
flooded by road crews

35:49.848 --> 35:51.982
In an effort to strengthen
the ice.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.417
Art: It's too thin, eh.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.820
This is gonna be a (bleep) show.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.091
Narrator: But even after a
night of cold temperatures...

36:02.461 --> 36:06.062
- It's not even (bleep) froze
under there.

36:06.064 --> 36:09.933
Narrator: The crossing
might not be strong enough
for safe passage.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.136
Art: Last year, I (bleep) near
went through, eh.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.005
I broke through
the surface layer.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.310
Art: No, no, no, no, no.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.245
We're gonna go through the ice
here you got that?

36:22.247 --> 36:23.613
(water splashing)

36:26.318 --> 36:29.252
Narrator: If art's over
the 34 ton weight limit

36:30.489 --> 36:34.124
This could be a life
or death decision.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.561
- It says 34 ton.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.263
That would give me like
68,000 pounds.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.666
So I'm guessing this, right?

36:46.004 --> 36:48.805
To tell you the honest
to god truth I don't know.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.473
The sensible side of me
is saying,

36:50.475 --> 36:54.110
You know art maybe we should
wait and see what's going on?

36:54.112 --> 36:57.080
The crazy side is saying,
(bleep) that prick, art.

36:57.082 --> 36:59.149
Go, go, go, go, go!

36:59.151 --> 37:00.483
Eh.

37:00.485 --> 37:04.955
So I think I'm gonna go a
little bit with the crazy side
this morning

37:04.957 --> 37:06.990
Cause I think I can make it.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.625
(wind howls)

37:08.627 --> 37:11.494
Before the sun comes up
and starts (bleep) it up.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.834
(airbrakes hiss)

37:19.004 --> 37:20.670
(engine roars)

37:27.713 --> 37:29.312
I don't know if this is
the right decision,

37:29.314 --> 37:31.982
But I'm doing it anyway.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.388
(ice cracking)

37:38.390 --> 37:40.023
Open your (bleep) door.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.058
Open your (bleep) door!

37:47.899 --> 37:50.467
- Not gonna be answering your
stupid (bleep) questions
or nothing.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.402
You just listen for cracks.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.373
(tires crunching)

37:56.375 --> 37:58.742
I'm on the (bleep) ice now.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.850
When I say bail you (bleep)
well bail, okay?

38:09.254 --> 38:11.154
(ice cracking)

38:15.827 --> 38:17.227
- I don't know where we're at.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.964
Just please sit there
and be (bleep) quiet

38:20.966 --> 38:22.866
With your door open.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.873
(ice cracking)

38:33.912 --> 38:34.911
Look at this.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.681
Somebody (bleep) popped
through there.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.283
That's all we need is something
like that to happen

38:40.285 --> 38:42.285
And the gig is up, b'y.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.056
(bleep) big crack there.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.357
(ice cracking)

38:48.460 --> 38:50.760
(water gurgling)

38:56.601 --> 38:58.802
Look at this coming now.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.503
Holy (bleep)!

39:00.505 --> 39:02.272
I don't want him beside me.

39:03.275 --> 39:05.342
Narrator: As art nears the edge
of the crossing

39:05.344 --> 39:07.377
Where ice is at its thinnest

39:07.379 --> 39:12.015
Any added weight could be enough
to cause the ice to shatter.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.584
- (bleep), ole buddy, don't
come near me for (bleep) sakes.

39:14.586 --> 39:15.785
Stay way far away.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.754
You'll get us drowned.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.356
Get the (bleep) out of here!

39:19.358 --> 39:21.358
Get the (bleep) away from me!

39:29.234 --> 39:32.669
Narrator: On the ice crossing
just outside st. Theresa point,

39:34.506 --> 39:36.573
Art: Look at this coming now.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.375
(bleep)!

39:38.377 --> 39:40.443
I don't want him beside me.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.045
Narrator: Polar driver art burke

39:42.047 --> 39:44.781
May have reached the breaking
point.

39:44.783 --> 39:47.283
- (bleep) ole buddy, don't come
near me for (bleep) sakes.

39:47.285 --> 39:48.618
Stay away far away.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.387
You'll get us drowned.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.757
Narrator: With art's load
right at the weight limit

39:53.759 --> 39:55.525
Even a single truck
could be enough

39:55.527 --> 39:57.260
To start the pressure
waves below

39:57.262 --> 40:00.363
Flowing from both directions

40:00.365 --> 40:03.166
And shattering the fragile ice.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.838
Art: (bleep), man.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.475
Get the (bleep) out of here
for (bleep) sake!

40:12.477 --> 40:13.676
Get out of here!

40:13.678 --> 40:15.712
Get the (bleep) away from me!

40:15.714 --> 40:18.381
(ice cracking)

40:18.383 --> 40:28.358
♪♪♪

40:28.360 --> 40:30.160
(bleep), b'y.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.498
I got to be (bleep)
to be doing this, eh.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.734
(bleep) I think it's a mile.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.469
I'm not sure if it ends
right there or not.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.404
I'm hoping the (bleep)
it ends right there.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.376
(bleep) near there, b'y.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.412
(ice cracking)

40:50.515 --> 40:52.382
Go, go, go, go, go.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.221
So we made 'er across.

41:00.091 --> 41:03.426
I only (bleep) in my pants
twice across. (laughs)

41:08.066 --> 41:09.766
Here we are at st. Theresa's,
b'y.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.869
Narrator: Art makes it to his
destination.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.704
(airbrakes hiss)

41:15.674 --> 41:18.141
- We got her done again, b'y.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.277
I was scared the load was
gonna be all screwed up, eh,

41:21.279 --> 41:22.779
But it's nice.

41:22.781 --> 41:25.148
Stayed nice and dry.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.084
Narrator: The high price hauls
delivered safe and sound

41:28.086 --> 41:31.888
And the wild card comes
through big for polar.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.157
- Good day. Sun is shining.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.559
They're happy with their stuff
and they got it.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.695
I prevailed again.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.471
Narrator: Next time...

41:49.708 --> 41:51.908
On "ice road truckers"...

41:51.910 --> 41:54.444
- So far I'd say this
is the worst road yet.

41:54.446 --> 41:56.513
Narrator: The roads go
from bad...

41:56.515 --> 41:57.647
(thud)

41:57.649 --> 42:00.617
Steph: Holy (bleep)!

42:00.619 --> 42:02.218
Narrator:...To worse.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.920
(beeping)
- I have no idea
if we'll make it.

42:03.922 --> 42:06.256
- I can see how they call
this the death road.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.659
Narrator: And for the rookie...

42:09.661 --> 42:11.494
Steph: Say I did go through,
how fast am I gonna go through?

42:11.496 --> 42:13.196
- You're gonna go through
probably pretty quick.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.899
Narrator: ...It's trial by ice.

42:15.901 --> 42:19.035
(truck rumbles)

42:19.037 --> 42:20.403
Todd: (on radio) watch it!

42:20.405 --> 42:23.106
(ice cracking)
steph: Oh my god.
