together, come on!

07:34.037 --> 07:35.455
- Hey, Joey.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.455
- Oh, hey, Danny.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.207
Hey, how's the squad

07:35.496 --> 07:37.207
coming this year?

07:37.249 --> 07:38.875
[imitating Bill Murray]

07:37.249 --> 07:38.875
Well, uh, it's

07:37.249 --> 07:38.875
a rebuilding year

07:38.917 --> 07:41.544
so, uh, so we're going

07:38.917 --> 07:41.544
with the youth movement.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.963
And, uh, you

07:41.586 --> 07:42.963
know, the tykes

07:43.004 --> 07:44.631
they like to put

07:43.004 --> 07:44.631
the boot to the ball.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.591
So, we got that going

07:44.672 --> 07:46.591
for us, but, uh, you know

07:46.633 --> 07:48.802
it's a plus when

07:46.633 --> 07:48.802
you think about it.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.264
Okay, Michelle,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.264
your turn.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.517
[kids laughing]

07:56.559 --> 07:58.353
Honey, just concentrate.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.772
It's a big net

07:58.395 --> 08:00.772
and a small ball.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.856
Make it happen.

08:11.116 --> 08:14.953
Yes! Derek S. Boyd

08:11.116 --> 08:14.953
with the save.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.541
That's okay,

08:17.622 --> 08:20.541
Michelle, nice try.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.586
Joey, she's not, uh, what's

08:20.583 --> 08:23.586
the word I'm looking for?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.672
- Good?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.672
- Oh, Danny, come on.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.257
It's her first day.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.257
She's just learning.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.843
And look how much

08:27.299 --> 08:29.843
fun she's having.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.261
I don't know,

08:29.884 --> 08:31.261
D.J. and Steph

08:31.303 --> 08:33.972
they were natural athletes.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.972
They took after me.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.141
'I guess in order for Michelle

08:34.014 --> 08:36.141
to become a good soccer player'

08:36.183 --> 08:38.268
she's going to need

08:36.183 --> 08:38.268
a little practice.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.769
[Michelle grunting]

08:39.811 --> 08:41.562
Danny, I think

08:39.811 --> 08:41.562
her soccer's fine.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.898
I-I think her shoe-tying

08:41.604 --> 08:43.898
needs a little work.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.197
[instrumental music]

08:51.614 --> 08:54.284
Alright, Tanner's all

08:51.614 --> 08:54.284
alone right up at the net.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.994
It's just her

08:54.326 --> 08:55.994
and the goaltender.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.413
She takes

08:56.036 --> 08:58.413
a mighty kick and..

08:59.080 --> 09:00.123
[thud]

09:00.165 --> 09:01.375
...goal!

09:02.167 --> 09:03.293
That's 48 straight goals

09:03.335 --> 09:04.336
for Michelle Tanner.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.712
Forty eight straight.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.507
A good time to go in

09:05.753 --> 09:08.507
for supper. Right, dad?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.633
Sweetheart, we still

09:08.548 --> 09:10.633
have plenty of time.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.843
Remember, the better you play

09:11.885 --> 09:13.512
the more you're

09:11.885 --> 09:13.512
gonna like soccer.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.722
I thought I liked it already.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.892
Hey, guess what,

09:16.848 --> 09:18.892
string bean?

09:18.933 --> 09:22.729
Thanks to me, you can say

09:18.933 --> 09:22.729
goodbye to irritating pests.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.857
- You're moving?

09:22.770 --> 09:25.857
- No.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.569
I just put in a heavy-duty

09:25.899 --> 09:29.569
bug zapper, the Insect Inferno.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.904
This baby gets them all.

Pesky flies.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.241

09:34.282 --> 09:35.575
Annoying mosquitoes.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.290
Nearsighted squirrels.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.292
Oh, but don't worry.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.292
He's only stunned.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.503
Hey, how many

09:44.334 --> 09:46.503
fingers do you see?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.298
I gotta build a higher fence.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.342
Alright, Michelle.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.761
'It's time to get back

09:52.384 --> 09:54.761
to business. Okay?'

09:54.802 --> 09:57.222
Daddy, why can't we go in now?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.434
Sweetheart, you know what they

09:57.264 --> 10:00.434
say, practice makes perfect.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.852
Why can't they say,

10:00.475 --> 10:02.852
"Let's eat?"

10:04.396 --> 10:06.731
Hey, Dan, don't you think

10:04.396 --> 10:06.731
it's time to call it quits?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.066
Jess, all I'm trying to do

10:08.108 --> 10:10.402
is make Michelle

10:08.108 --> 10:10.402
a better soccer player.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.570
You sound like my dad.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.653
All he was tryin' to do was

10:12.695 --> 10:14.655
make me a better

10:12.695 --> 10:14.655
baseball player.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.158
But he pushed me so hard,

10:14.697 --> 10:17.158
the guy scarred me for life.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.618
I mean, after school each day

10:18.659 --> 10:19.994
he-he'd crouch behind the plate

10:20.036 --> 10:21.162
and I had to throw a 100 strikes

10:21.204 --> 10:22.705
before I was

10:21.204 --> 10:22.705
allowed to eat dinner.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.665
How did that scar you for life?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.834
To this day I

10:24.707 --> 10:26.834
hate baseball and..

10:26.876 --> 10:29.296
...I still get hungry every

10:26.876 --> 10:29.296
time I see a Greek man squat.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.009
That's not gonna

10:33.633 --> 10:35.009
happen to Michelle.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.553
I happen to be

10:35.051 --> 10:36.553
an excellent soccer coach.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.263
Come on, what do you

10:36.595 --> 10:38.263
know about soccer?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.515
I've never seen you kick

10:38.305 --> 10:40.515
anything but a tire on a car..

10:40.557 --> 10:42.725
...and you missed.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.561
Hey, if you guys just give

10:42.767 --> 10:44.561
me a little bit of room here

10:44.603 --> 10:47.355
I will demonstrate my

10:44.603 --> 10:47.355
amazing soccer skills, okay?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.065
You guys see the knothole

10:47.397 --> 10:49.065
in the fence right there?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.275
- Uh-huh.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.069
Well, don't take

10:50.317 --> 10:53.069
your eyes off it.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.490

10:53.111 --> 10:56.490

11:10.128 --> 11:11.838
to watch that knothole?

11:13.590 --> 11:18.052
Hey, you owe me 90 bucks

11:13.590 --> 11:18.052
for a new Insect Inferno.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.554
What are you talking about?

11:19.596 --> 11:22.432
I give you exhibit A.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.229
Oh, "Great Balls Of Fire."

This is definitely

11:30.857 --> 11:32.942
two thumbs up.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.777
They'll probably show

11:32.984 --> 11:34.777
this on parent night.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.237
Steph, wait, you can't use that.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.448
Steph, Steph,

11:36.279 --> 11:38.448
this is embarrassing..

11:38.490 --> 11:41.326
[instrumental music]

11:42.743 --> 11:45.746
[indistinct chattering]

11:49.708 --> 11:52.003
Okay, okay. Stay in

11:49.708 --> 11:52.003
position. Don't bunch up.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.712
Michelle, never

11:52.045 --> 11:53.712
<i>ever</i> bunch up!

11:53.754 --> 11:55.590
Yeah, Michelle, if you feel

11:53.754 --> 11:55.590
like you have to bunch up

11:55.632 --> 11:57.384
I say, what the heck?

11:55.632 --> 11:57.384
Go ahead, bunch.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.010
Bunch if you have to,

11:57.425 --> 11:59.010
if you have..

12:00.387 --> 12:03.264
A little bunching now

12:00.387 --> 12:03.264
and again never hurt anyone.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.432
Have fun, kids.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.642
Come on, honey.

Hi, guys.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.149
Did I miss anything?

12:13.191 --> 12:14.901
Yeah, just your dad

12:13.191 --> 12:14.901
and your Uncle Jesse

12:14.942 --> 12:17.362
of meddling buttinskis.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.241
Why am I never around

12:18.697 --> 12:21.241
for the Kodak moments?

12:22.701 --> 12:25.620
- 'Ha ha. Come on!'

12:22.701 --> 12:25.620
- 'Come on, guys!'

12:25.662 --> 12:27.622
Michelle, hold on a second,

12:25.662 --> 12:27.622
sweetheart. Listen to me.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.041
The game is tied three-three

12:27.664 --> 12:30.041
and there's only a minute left.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.167
Okay? I want you

12:30.083 --> 12:31.167
to be aggressive.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.377
I want you to get out there

12:32.419 --> 12:34.170
go for that ball

12:32.419 --> 12:34.170
and score, okay?

12:34.212 --> 12:35.963
- We can win, honey.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.963
- Okay, daddy.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.174
No, no, no, wa-wait a minute.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.174
It's-it's okay if you don't win.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.967
Alright? It's just a game.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.967
I mean, life goes on.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.344
Tomorrow you're

12:40.009 --> 12:41.344
gonna wake up

12:41.386 --> 12:42.803
you know, the sun

12:41.386 --> 12:42.803
will be shining

the birds will be singing,

12:42.845 --> 12:44.389
you'll have your health

12:44.431 --> 12:46.391
you'll have most

12:44.431 --> 12:46.391
of your teeth..

12:46.433 --> 12:47.934
- Okay, Uncle Jesse.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.934
- Good.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.686
Hey, guys, come on,

12:47.975 --> 12:49.686
I got a game going on.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.563
You see what's

12:49.728 --> 12:51.563
on my shirt?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.856
It says, "Coach," so let me

12:51.605 --> 12:53.856
do my job. Michelle, go on.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.317
- Get in there. Let's go.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.317
- Good luck, honey. Good luck.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.904
(Danny)

12:58.361 --> 12:59.904
'Hey, she's got the ball!'

12:59.946 --> 13:02.407
Okay, honey, we've got

12:59.946 --> 13:02.407
the ball now. We can win!

13:02.449 --> 13:03.950
It's just a game.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.950
Have fun, now.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.370
Michelle, turn around!

13:05.410 --> 13:07.370
You're going the wrong way!

13:07.412 --> 13:09.414
No, no, no, honey.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.414
The other way!

13:11.625 --> 13:13.418
No! No! No!

13:13.460 --> 13:16.546
Michelle, you'll have a lot more

13:13.460 --> 13:16.546
fun if you were going that way.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.256
- It's more fun that way..

13:16.588 --> 13:18.256
- Other way.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.677
Michelle, no!

13:30.226 --> 13:33.563
I scored! I scored! I scored!

13:34.188 --> 13:36.524
[whistle blows]

13:36.566 --> 13:39.778
- Way to go.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.778
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.613
You guys are good losers.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.821
Not exactly.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.288
Nice work, Michelle.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.165
What? I scored the winning goal.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.293
Did you happen to

13:52.206 --> 13:55.293
see who the goalie is?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.798
Yeah. He looks a lot like Derek.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.840
He<i> is</i> Derek.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.469
You scored for the other team.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.596
We lost because of you.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.433
[instrumental music]

14:24.781 --> 14:26.825
[instrumental music]

14:28.618 --> 14:30.244
Oh, come on, now, don't cry.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.205
I mean, who'd expect

14:30.286 --> 14:32.205
Michelle to kick the ball

14:32.246 --> 14:34.833
into her own net

14:32.246 --> 14:34.833
in the first place?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.917
Well, listen, you, you

14:34.874 --> 14:36.917
have a little bite to eat

14:36.959 --> 14:39.462
maybe take a nap

14:36.959 --> 14:39.462
and you'll feel all better.

14:39.504 --> 14:40.505
Uh-huh.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.631
Right.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.383
Okay. Bye-bye.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.761
Derek's taking it

14:44.967 --> 14:46.761
pretty hard, huh?

14:52.099 --> 14:54.018

14:56.187 --> 14:57.605
I put so much pressure on her

14:57.647 --> 15:00.274

14:57.647 --> 15:00.274
she was comin' or goin'.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.652

15:00.316 --> 15:02.652

15:02.694 --> 15:05.697
Then I got ahold of her and I

15:02.694 --> 15:05.697

15:16.875 --> 15:19.335

15:21.671 --> 15:23.172

15:21.671 --> 15:23.172

16:00.794 --> 16:02.712

16:02.754 --> 16:03.963
Must really hurt.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.592
It does. Look.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.592

16:07.634 --> 16:10.177

16:24.191 --> 16:26.193
But I think your

16:24.191 --> 16:26.193

16:26.235 --> 16:27.737

16:26.235 --> 16:27.737

16:27.779 --> 16:30.072
at the soccer game.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.366
Well, maybe

16:30.114 --> 16:32.366
it's not broken

16:32.408 --> 16:34.368
but it's still

16:32.408 --> 16:34.368

16:35.620 --> 16:37.997
to tell you something.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.499
I'm really sorry.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.208
I put too much

16:39.540 --> 16:41.208

16:43.252 --> 16:44.754
for you to be

16:43.252 --> 16:44.754

16:44.796 --> 16:47.256
That's okay, daddy.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.049
Thank you, sweetheart.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.510
Your Uncle Jesse was right.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.595
You should just play

16:50.551 --> 16:52.595

16:54.138 --> 16:57.558

17:06.108 --> 17:08.528
you gotta keep doing it.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.789

17:16.160 --> 17:19.789

17:19.831 --> 17:22.249

17:22.291 --> 17:24.084

17:24.126 --> 17:26.546

17:24.126 --> 17:26.546

17:26.587 --> 17:29.632

17:26.587 --> 17:29.632

that somewhere

17:45.940 --> 17:48.359
