00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
Sounds like it's coming from
outside.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
This morning, Sarah
and Duck are spying on Duck's toys,

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
to see if they move
when they're not looking.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Anything yet?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Nuh-uh.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
QUACK QUACK!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Ah!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Huh?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Sounds like it's coming from
outside.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Donkey!
How'd he get into the garden?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
BRAY!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Whoa!

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
My word! That was quite a jump!

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Yuh-huh! Let's go see Donkey!

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Donkey! You can jump!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Donkey?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What's wrong?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
BRAY...

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
You know, I think he's embarrassed.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Maybe we should ask Scarf Lady?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Good idea!

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
She'll help us get to the

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
BOTTOM of this! Eh?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh... Never mind.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Did you know Donkey could jump?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
He's acting a little strangely.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Er... Oh... Um...

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Our Donkey was one of the best
show jumpers around.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Until... Oh.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Until what?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It was at the Hairy Hoof Showground.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
You can keep this one, dear.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
He went round the course
the wrong way.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Everyone laughed and he hasn't
jumped in front of anyone since.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, that's sad.
He looks happy when he's jumping.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Yes, it's a shame, really.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Huh!
What is it, Sarah?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
We can help Donkey jump again!
Oh?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
We'll make this for him!

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Ah! His very own hurdles!
Uh-huh!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
QUACK!

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Come on, Duck,
we need some jumpy bits!

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
QUACK!

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
QUACK!

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And you are the judges!
ALL: Ooh!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Judges!

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
A job well done! I'm sure
Donkey won't be able to resist it.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Uh-huh! Let's go get him!

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
ALL: Yay!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Get him!

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Hello, Donkey! We've got
something to show you.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
In the garden!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
BRAY.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Hmm. Better try Plan B.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And... We got carrots?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
BRAY!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Here you go!
BRAY!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
MUNCH MUNCH

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Ta-da!

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
QUACK QUACK!
BRAY!

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
ALL: Donkey! Donkey! Donkey!
Jump!

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
BRAY!

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
We made it for you.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Huh?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Maybe Donkey needs a bit more
encouragement?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
OK...

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
We'll go first!
Come on, Duck!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
QUACK QUACK!

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Ready? Ready.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
QUACK!

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Judges?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
3...! 2...! 1...! GO!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
QUACK!

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
First up, it's the Bakery Bounce.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
They've cleared that easily!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
On to the Sea Cow Splash.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Aren't you meant to jump
over the water?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Well, you said SPLASH.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Of course.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Ah!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
QUACK QUACK!

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
A chance to dry off,
next it's the Rainbow Long Jump!

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Duck is first.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
QUACK...

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
He's not rushing this one, it's a
careful performance.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Ah, the Toy Tower is next.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Can Sarah clear it?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Ooh!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
ROAR

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
It's a stand-off!
Who will pick up Rhino?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Erm...

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
QUACK QUACK!

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Duck in the lead again. Just one
more jump. The Souffle Soar!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh!

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Mmm, soft...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
QUACK QUACK!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Aah, oof!

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
QUACK!

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Almost there!

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
THUMP

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Oh...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Duck! Duck! Duck!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Winner!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
QUACK QUACK!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
ALL: Yay!

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
BRAY!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Your turn, Donkey!

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
BRAY?!

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
BRAY, BRAY, BRAY!

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Huh!

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
GALLOPING HOOVES

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Wow! You did it!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Now you try, Donkey!

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Huh?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Ah, well.
One jump at a time, I suppose.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah. Suppose so!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Good jump, Donkey!

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
QUACK!

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Looks like someone wants a rematch.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
3! 2! 1! GO!

06:47.000 --> 06:57.000
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
