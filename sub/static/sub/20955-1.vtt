WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:04.172
CAMILA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.205 --> 00:05.806
If I'm dead,
you take this notebook

00:05.839 --> 00:07.241
and you trade it
for your life, all right?

00:07.275 --> 00:08.876
What's in it
can destroy Epifanio.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.178
MAN: Get out of the house, now.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.480
-We have to go.
-Ah.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.014
Where do I know you from?

00:14.048 --> 00:16.717
I was Guero's girlfriend.
He's dead.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.586
CAMILA: You have proven you can
be relied upon

00:18.619 --> 00:20.654
to do what I need.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.656
(gunfire)

00:22.690 --> 00:24.192
Come on!

00:24.225 --> 00:25.993
I shot him.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.595
That's not who I am.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.430
That's not who I want
to become.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.165
What is this?
This doesn't make any sense.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.334
TERESA: We need to figure out
what it means.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.868
It's coordinates.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.003
I'm gonna have to
go back to Mexico.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.105
-Brenda!
-Ah!

00:37.138 --> 00:39.006
TERESA: They killed her.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.242
CAMILA: The only thing
my husband cannot afford

00:41.275 --> 00:42.910
is to fight a war.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.045
So while he's distracted,
I'm gonna take over.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.580
He'd rather destroy it all

00:46.614 --> 00:48.449
before losing it to you.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.185
Guero, who is this?

00:51.219 --> 00:53.421
It's Teresa Mendoza.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.955
We need to negotiate terms.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.324
I don't work for you.

00:57.825 --> 01:02.430
(light pop music)

01:02.463 --> 01:06.033
THE QUEEN: There's an old saying
about success.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.703
That it's lonely at the top.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.740
I'm here to tell you
that's bullshit.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.409
I run an international
drug empire

01:15.443 --> 01:18.146
and I have everyone
and everything that I need.

01:18.179 --> 01:22.450
*

01:22.483 --> 01:26.420
Buenas tarde.

01:26.454 --> 01:29.657
THE QUEEN: On the way up,
even your worst enemies

01:29.690 --> 01:33.394
can become your best friends.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.497
And your best friends,
collateral damage.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.406
And the five-star hotels
I stay in now,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.241
they're a hell of a lot better

01:47.275 --> 01:48.976
than the filthy bed I slept on
as a drug mule.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.184
And couture feels better
than flannel.

01:59.687 --> 02:03.123
But if there's one thing
I've learned in this business,

02:03.157 --> 02:06.527
it's that
no se puede tener todo...

02:06.560 --> 02:08.929
You can't have it all.

02:08.962 --> 02:15.969
*

02:33.987 --> 02:36.957
And if you want to succeed
in this business,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.793
someday you will have to
choose between survival

02:39.827 --> 02:41.795
and your heart.

02:41.829 --> 02:48.836
*

02:53.874 --> 02:55.175
(silenced gunshot)

02:58.111 --> 03:00.581
I didn't make these rules.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.183
I was taught them.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.653
You think it would get easier.

03:05.686 --> 03:09.523
And the scary part, it does.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.827
ANNOUNCER: Earlier today,
Epifanio Vargas,

03:13.861 --> 03:16.063
the newly elected governor
of Sinaloa,

03:16.096 --> 03:18.532
held a press conference
to discuss yesterday's raids

03:18.566 --> 03:22.035
by the Mexican military
on suspected cartel members.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.672
EPIFANIO: The seeds of
corruption and violence

03:24.705 --> 03:28.008
brought on by the Vargas
cartel--who for too long,

03:28.041 --> 03:30.878
had ruled over this great state
through fear--

03:30.911 --> 03:32.580
needs to stop.
(gun cocks)

03:32.613 --> 03:34.682
Now they will know
what it is to be afraid.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.918
Epifanio sicced the Federales
on my lieutenants

03:37.951 --> 03:39.920
like a pack of wild dogs.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.422
He'll take me if he can.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.791
I know a place in Juarez
we can lay low.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.626
It's too risky
to stay too long here

03:45.659 --> 03:48.296
on this side of the border.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.063
We're going back to Dallas.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.600
We'll need papers
for Teresa and Pote.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.268
Epifanio controls
all the mule routes.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.769
He doesn't control me.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.643
(phone dialing out)

04:02.676 --> 04:04.111
Mayo...

04:13.287 --> 04:15.923
That truck is following us.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.292
It's been behind us
since El Limpiador's place.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.899
(hip-hop music)
(gun cocks)

04:25.933 --> 04:32.940
*

04:34.942 --> 04:38.145
Lose them.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.380
Now.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.521
If they get too close,
take 'em out.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.156
(gun cocks)

04:56.163 --> 04:59.867
(speaks Spanish)

04:59.900 --> 05:02.135
Just pull the trigger.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.043
JAMES: They're gaining on us.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.479
Let's go, Teresa.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.152
(gunfire)

05:24.558 --> 05:26.126
(tires screeching)

05:26.159 --> 05:29.129
(intense music)

05:29.162 --> 05:36.169
*

05:42.576 --> 05:44.578
Let's go.

05:44.612 --> 05:49.850
*

05:49.883 --> 05:51.485
Radar'll pick 'em up
as they cross the border.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.220
Not below 2,000 feet.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.356
He stays low enough,
we lose him for good.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.363
(gunfire)

06:07.034 --> 06:08.902
I hate Mexico.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.905
(dramatic music)

06:11.939 --> 06:13.607
*

06:22.049 --> 06:25.018
(light music)

06:25.052 --> 06:32.059
*

07:04.257 --> 07:05.793
What is this place?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.728
Someplace Epifanio
doesn't know about.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.597
Camila got it on the cheap
from a dealer

07:09.630 --> 07:10.931
who went to prison.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.101
So this is where
we're hiding out?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.435
You didn't think Camila Vargas

07:15.469 --> 07:17.838
would lay low in a dump,
did you?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.006
Get settled.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.808
We could be here a while.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.815
It's 500k, cash.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.619
Weapons. We've kept as much
manpower as we can afford.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.186
It's enough till we're back
on our feet.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.822
It wasn't him.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.758
El Limpiador worked
for Epifanio.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.260
He must've been watching the
place and had us followed.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.097
Epifanio's men wouldn't have
let us get away.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.433
There's only one organization
I can think of

07:46.466 --> 07:50.437
that would like
to take us alive.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.273
We've done everything we can
to stay off the Feds' radar.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.643
They've got nothing--
not on you, not on me,

07:55.676 --> 07:59.146
not on any part
of this operation.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.515
Well, you better hope
you're right.

08:01.549 --> 08:05.553
(Spanish radio chatter)

08:05.586 --> 08:07.320
ALONZO: We kept you safe
from Epifanio.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.723
If it wasn't for us, you'd
end up like your boy Chino.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.191
Look, man, I've been
giving you people--

08:11.224 --> 08:13.493
Guppies, Guero.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.128
My boss is done with all that.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.197
No, no, we had a deal.
No time if I talk.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.499
And that was all fine and good
until your girlfriend showed up

08:19.533 --> 08:22.402
in the belly of the beast.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.072
That's a game changer.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.541
Gimme me something real, Guero.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.978
You mean this shithole motel
ain't real enough for you?

08:31.011 --> 08:35.148
Yeah. You try staying
in this dump.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.717
How you doing?

08:45.959 --> 08:48.662
This is it, Mr. Davila.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.197
This is your moment.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.332
You give me
actionable intelligence

08:52.365 --> 08:54.735
on the Vargas cartel,

08:54.768 --> 08:57.671
or I put you on the mainline
in a snitch jacket.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.841
You know how that'll play.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.943
Bad cop again?

09:02.976 --> 09:06.246
Yeah, you really gotta start
watching more cop shows, man.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.583
Camila's on the run.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.119
And she's on the run
with your girl.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.560
We believe they're
in the States.

09:20.594 --> 09:24.564
Where's she hiding?

09:24.598 --> 09:28.602
I don't know.
I'm just a pilot.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.937
Last chance.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.805
Where's Camila's safe house?

09:42.750 --> 09:48.055
I flew Camila out here once
on business.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.990
I might know a place.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.464
How many have we lost?

09:57.497 --> 09:59.299
All of 'em.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.401
Every last dealer
is bailing on us.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.237
We've got no source.
We've got no distro.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.673
We've got
someone on our ass

10:05.706 --> 10:06.707
and we don't even know
who it is.

10:10.277 --> 10:14.247
I'd like to talk to Camila.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.850
Alone, please.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.527
You're lucky to have
such a loyal man.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.029
He's lucky to have me.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.330
Well, whatever
he's done for you,

10:30.363 --> 10:32.499
I can do, too.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.368
Every child in Siete Gotas
is born with a gun in his hand

10:35.402 --> 10:37.537
instead of a rattle.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.139
I have all the muscle I need.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.342
I'm not offering protection.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.344
I'm good with numbers.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.180
I was a money changer
when I was 15.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.716
By 16, I ran my own block--

10:48.749 --> 10:50.684
And then you got
swept off your feet by Guero

10:50.718 --> 10:52.319
and became his morra.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.055
And you spent years worrying
about your pedicure

10:55.088 --> 10:58.191
and about how good your ass
looked in those tight jeans.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.293
Am I wrong?

11:00.327 --> 11:05.165
Nothing wrong with beauty
when there's brains beneath it.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.666
What do you want from me?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.702
I want to be part
of the business.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.037
I can be useful.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.472
(chuckles)
You'll end up in prison.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.543
Or dead, like every other
narco in Culiacán.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.049
I know the risks.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.051
I just lost my best friend.

11:24.084 --> 11:28.021
She's dead because of Epifanio.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.758
You've made it.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.494
You're still here.

11:34.527 --> 11:39.232
It took more than
20 years of blood and sweat

11:39.266 --> 11:40.934
to build what I have.

11:40.968 --> 11:44.004
What does a girl like you
have to offer me?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.740
The book your husband's
been after.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.743
(dramatic music)

11:49.777 --> 11:53.713
*

11:53.747 --> 11:57.417
You know, these names...

11:57.450 --> 12:00.053
It could be useful.
Look at this.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.294
It's a code
for a smuggler's name.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.229
George Megalos.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.398
Yeah. King George.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.866
I've heard his name.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.268
So you know he works
on the Texas coast,

12:15.302 --> 12:18.271
making smuggling runs
to and from South America.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.707
Guero kept track of all the
kilos he was flying for him.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.976
Look at this.

12:23.010 --> 12:27.114
You need a new route
to bring in product.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.750
Maybe he can help you.

12:30.784 --> 12:35.255
One name?
That's all you're offering.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.624
And my loyalty.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.227
Whatever you need.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.230
Would you die for me?

12:43.263 --> 12:46.133
No, I'll do better.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.534
I'll survive for you.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.075
Which do you prefer?
The red or the striped?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.643
The red one.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.145
It'll look good with my dress.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.647
Your mother
prefers the red, too,

13:00.680 --> 13:02.816
like an angry bull.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.818
You'll be at my side
at the press conference?

13:04.852 --> 13:08.321
Yes, Papi. I told you
I'd be there.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.825
-Ciao, Mija.
-Bye.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.327
Colonel Cortez.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.528
Governador.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.830
You asked for this meeting.

13:16.864 --> 13:17.831
What is it you want?

13:17.865 --> 13:20.633
(speaking Spanish)

13:20.667 --> 13:23.203
(speaking Spanish)

13:23.236 --> 13:24.872
You raided the cartel members

13:24.905 --> 13:26.806
and you shut down
their operations.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.643
In the name of the state of
Culiacán, I thank you.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.780
Cartel members that betrayed you
to work for your wife.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.649
Your orders were impressively
self-serving.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.519
It's not often that civic duty
and personal ambition

13:39.552 --> 13:41.688
is so perfectly aligned.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.456
I'm the Governor of this state.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.026
You are under my command.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.560
Of course, Governor.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.365
Clearly, you are in charge.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.572
And clearly,
you don't know better

13:59.606 --> 14:02.209
than to bite the hand
that feeds you.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.711
What is it that you want?

14:04.744 --> 14:08.248
Since your separation
from Camila,

14:08.281 --> 14:10.717
your business
isn't faring too well.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.921
The loss of your lieutenants
laid waste to 37%

14:13.954 --> 14:15.588
of your distribution.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.358
With your wife gone,
you will need assistance.

14:18.391 --> 14:22.029
Your political power,
my military strength.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.564
We will be unstoppable.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.244
We're here to see
George Megalos.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.711
No Megalos here.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.113
King George.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.251
Gun in box.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.692
Come on.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.061
Stop.

14:56.596 --> 15:00.433
Give it to me.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.502
Guns and knife in box.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.112
Go. Go!

15:21.421 --> 15:24.992
(gunshots, glass shattering)

15:25.025 --> 15:26.659
GEORGE: Whoo!

15:32.199 --> 15:34.334
Royal target practice.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.071
Nothing but the best!

15:38.105 --> 15:39.306
(laughs)

15:39.339 --> 15:41.141
What the hell are y'all wearing?

15:41.174 --> 15:44.244
It's a boat,
not a Morrissey concert.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.778
Hey, will someone get this lady

15:45.812 --> 15:48.781
a proper King George bikini,
please?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.984
-Listen--
-Not you, baby Chapo.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.419
Unless you wanna rock
one of these.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.087
Aerodynamic as shit.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.257
It'll make you feel alive.
Trust. (laughs)

15:57.290 --> 15:59.359
Hey. Gold one for her.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.927
-I'm good, thank you.
-Are you sure?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.329
'Cause I just got 'em brand-new.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.930
They're a bunch
of different colors.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.832
They got little--little crowns
on the ooh--ooh.

16:05.865 --> 16:10.803
Camila Vargas sent us.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.239
Camila Vargas, huh?

16:17.344 --> 16:18.778
No. Don't believe you.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.680
She sent us to make
a deal with you.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.450
Then where's my offering? Hm?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.119
Now, Camila Vargas knows
you don't approach a king

16:26.153 --> 16:27.287
without an offering.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.355
That would be rude.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.722
And being rude to a king,

16:29.756 --> 16:33.393
oh, that's just
universally unwise.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.794
Unless you're the offering.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.563
You the offering?

16:36.596 --> 16:37.864
Come on now, tell me
you're the offering.

16:37.897 --> 16:38.865
That'll be so cool.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.133
(gunshot)

16:40.167 --> 16:42.535
What the shit, Bilal?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.504
I'm right in the middle
of extorting sex.

16:44.537 --> 16:48.308
God damn, give me a chance.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.243
These little Fuddruckers tried
to Captain Phillip me

16:50.277 --> 16:51.544
off the coast of Somalia.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.481
Not their best day.
(laughs)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.015
Now I think of 'em like sons.

16:56.049 --> 17:00.087
Who's the captain now, bitches?
(laughs)

17:00.120 --> 17:01.888
They love that.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.756
We don't deal with lunatics.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.492
And I don't deal
with polliwogs.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.493
Let's go.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.395
No, no, no, no, no.

17:08.428 --> 17:12.365
See, you leave
when the King says so.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.766
(gunshot)

17:13.800 --> 17:15.034
Whoa!

17:15.068 --> 17:16.736
Do I have your attention now?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.338
I'm all ears.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.873
We need to ship cocaine
up the coast.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.075
You're going to help us.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.443
And why would I do that?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.212
Because it's gonna be dangerous.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.347
A man who puts holes
in his own boat

17:27.380 --> 17:29.416
isn't in this business
for the money.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.917
He's in for the thrill.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.919
Yeah?

17:32.952 --> 17:35.922
Well, how about this,
baby girl?

17:35.955 --> 17:37.690
I like the money, too.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.660
Good. Because you're about
to make a lot of it.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.940
(speaking Spanish)

17:53.973 --> 17:57.444
(speaking Spanish)

17:57.477 --> 18:00.480
(both speaking Spanish)

18:29.142 --> 18:31.678
(sighs)

18:31.711 --> 18:34.714
(speaking Spanish)

18:41.688 --> 18:42.689
(speaking Spanish)

18:46.326 --> 18:47.694
(laughs)

18:52.232 --> 18:53.800
Oy.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.469
(speaks Spanish)

18:56.503 --> 18:58.371
(speaks Spanish)

19:08.181 --> 19:10.016
A trawler company.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.351
What do I need
Camila's boats for?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.619
I got my own.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.221
It's a legit company on paper.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.023
Take the heat off you
using your own.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.527
And I'll hook you up
with some product.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.994
Mm?

19:29.769 --> 19:33.005
(grunts)

19:33.039 --> 19:36.809
That's earthy,
yet tart.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.546
Mid-palate gap,
not bad.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.813
Afterburners?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.916
Ooh, ooh, hoo, hoo!
(laughs)

19:43.950 --> 19:45.685
Oh. Ohh.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.187
I like your style,
Ken Kardashian.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.856
Our supplier's the best
in Mexico.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.725
Mm, and if I weren't making
more money than God

19:52.759 --> 19:57.397
selling guns and ganja,
I would be all over that.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.332
But truth of the matter is,

19:59.366 --> 20:02.502
no, I don't need
your boats.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.571
And I don't need your blow.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.940
(door opens)

20:07.974 --> 20:09.709
The princesses have arrived.
(laughs)

20:09.742 --> 20:11.244
Hi, honey.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.580
Ooh.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.115
Yeah.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.750
Head on down
to the chamber.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.254
Bilal, prepare the royal bath.
(laughs)

20:21.288 --> 20:22.422
Excuse me.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.091
Top speed of 30 knots.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.760
20% faster,
with a third more cargo space.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.196
Move our product,
your margins are higher.

20:30.229 --> 20:35.234
10% more profit
with 25% less risk.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.869
You can guarantee those numbers?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.771
Do one run with our trawlers.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.607
No charge.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.042
If we don't deliver, you're out.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.479
(laughs)

20:46.513 --> 20:48.415
Ohh!

20:48.448 --> 20:50.983
Brains, balls, and booty!

20:51.017 --> 20:53.986
(laughs) If Rico Suave here
didn't already have dibs,

20:54.020 --> 20:55.955
I might just make you my queen.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.627
All right.

21:00.660 --> 21:04.797
I accept your offer
on one condition.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.733
I need a little favor.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.635
What kind of favor?

21:08.668 --> 21:12.572
Well, I had a falling out with
a business associate in Houston.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.906
He owes me some money.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.274
We're not gonna kill for you.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.609
We're not gonna-- (laughs)

21:16.643 --> 21:18.144
No, no, no.
Come on, now.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.646
Nothing like that.
No, I just--

21:19.679 --> 21:21.180
I wanna have
a conversation with him.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.582
You know, clear the air.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.684
Kinda, King-to-subject
kind of thing.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.986
Only thing is,
he's making it difficult

21:27.019 --> 21:28.254
by refusing to meet.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.289
So it's a kidnap job.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.525
Oh, you call it what you will.

21:32.559 --> 21:37.797
But you want a piece
of this sweet ass, mm?

21:37.830 --> 21:41.668
Well, baby girl,
now that's my dowry.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.336
(laughs)

21:43.370 --> 21:45.738
-Baby dolls!
WOMEN: Yes, King George?

21:56.383 --> 21:59.218
The guy George wants
is called Rolando Rios.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.320
He's a three-time violent felon.

22:01.354 --> 22:06.025
Those tats on his neck are from
the gnarliest gang in Houston.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.627
Southwest Raza.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.897
Yeah, a guy this hard
won't go down easy.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.865
No one does.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.367
How would you know?

22:14.401 --> 22:16.736
I've been kidnapped.
How about you?

22:20.907 --> 22:24.411
(Mexican music playing on radio)

22:24.444 --> 22:26.012
(speaking Spanish)

22:29.949 --> 22:32.819
I like a man
who knows his place.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.856
What do you think
of my new home?

22:36.889 --> 22:38.991
Not bad.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.194
I've seen better.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.896
Never one to kiss ass.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.398
(laughs)

22:45.432 --> 22:47.233
Listen, I want you
to arrange a meeting

22:47.266 --> 22:50.937
between me and my husband.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.574
Tell him you have the book.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.776
And this meeting,

22:56.809 --> 22:58.945
is it gonna be a peaceful one?

22:58.978 --> 23:04.083
No marriage is ever
truly peaceful. No?

23:04.116 --> 23:07.019
If you wanna work for me
instead of my husband,

23:07.053 --> 23:09.088
you'll do as I say.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.524
No questions asked.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.661
(both speaking Spanish)

23:17.897 --> 23:19.799
Claro.

23:19.832 --> 23:25.271
(indistinct crowd chatter)

23:25.304 --> 23:26.973
Muchas gracias.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.646
Pote, where the hell are you?

23:33.680 --> 23:36.783
You say you are with Camila now?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.818
Can you deliver her to me?

23:38.851 --> 23:41.420
MAN:
* It's been a long time, uh

23:41.454 --> 23:44.791
* Since I've been me,
not a human, a monster *

23:44.824 --> 23:46.793
* Uh, I'm a lost soul,
I'm a freak *

23:46.826 --> 23:48.595
* I'm whatever you made me

23:48.628 --> 23:50.797
* I got a craving
I want your blood on my teeth *

23:50.830 --> 23:52.632
All right.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.567
Let's see if Guero's lead
on Camila was right.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.968
MAN:
* Show me what's up, then

23:56.002 --> 23:57.670
* Are we ready to bust in?

23:57.704 --> 23:59.939
* Take every day
leave 'em with nothing *

23:59.972 --> 24:01.508
* Ain't gonna be no discussion

24:01.541 --> 24:03.442
* We ain't talking no more

24:03.476 --> 24:05.812
* We about to rush in
never gon' see me coming *

24:05.845 --> 24:08.915
* Take every day
leave 'em with nothing *

24:08.948 --> 24:10.983
* Leave 'em with nothing

24:11.017 --> 24:12.919
(shouting)

24:12.952 --> 24:15.321
Go, go, go, go, go!

24:15.354 --> 24:17.757
Looks like they tucked tail
and ran.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.458
Stay alert.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.528
MAN:
* You late with the coming

24:21.561 --> 24:23.362
* And I'm here
to collect your debt *

24:23.395 --> 24:25.665
* I'm a loaded revolver

24:25.698 --> 24:28.367
*

24:28.400 --> 24:30.369
TERESA: Are you sure
this is the place?

24:30.402 --> 24:32.204
JAMES: It's the address
George gave us.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.374
It's a church.
You said he was a gangster.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.644
JAMES: A lot of guys who do time
are born again.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.812
Jailhouse conversions.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.748
Trust me, they don't stick.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.387
All right, he's alone.
It's time.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.569
(door rattles)

25:02.602 --> 25:05.572
Shh, shh, shh. Come on.
Come on, move.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.744
ROLANDO:
George sent you, right?

25:11.778 --> 25:14.413
You don't need to do this.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.683
Man of God, huh?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.818
All right, get in.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.387
Keep an eye on him till we get
back to the coast.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.058
FINNERMAN: Three dead agents.

25:26.092 --> 25:31.864
Jackson, Sanchez, Lee.

25:31.898 --> 25:35.668
Murdered by Camila's gang,
breaking Boaz Jimenez

25:35.702 --> 25:38.170
out of our safe house.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.073
She'll get word soon--
if she hasn't already--

25:41.107 --> 25:44.877
that we're here.

25:44.911 --> 25:48.581
This place belongs to us.

25:48.615 --> 25:52.284
And now we come for whatever
she's got left.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.797
(light ambient music)

26:04.831 --> 26:11.838
*

26:15.007 --> 26:16.976
Hey.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.445
My mom was a nurse
before I was born.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.281
She used to say,
"A bed is only as clean

26:22.314 --> 26:25.952
as its corners."

26:25.985 --> 26:28.587
We're just gonna
mess it up again.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.323
Oh, yeah? Really?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.663
Promise?

26:36.696 --> 26:40.166
(moans, laughs)

26:45.304 --> 26:47.539
ALONZO: She was here.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.647
She survived this place.

26:54.681 --> 26:57.449
But Teresa isn't just alive.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.619
She's rolling
with Camila Vargas.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.655
You know how that story ends.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.156
Teresa was a money changer, man.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.825
That's all she ever did.

27:05.858 --> 27:09.095
Till she met you.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.999
You got a chance
to make it right.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.501
Not many people get that.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.603
Help us take down Camila.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.038
Help us pull Teresa out of

27:19.071 --> 27:20.606
whatever mess she's gotten
herself into.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.608
Hey, man. You don't give
a shit about Teresa.

27:22.641 --> 27:27.714
No. That's your job.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.216
And you running
out of time, my man.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.659
(cell phone rings)

27:42.261 --> 27:46.198
Yeah.

27:46.232 --> 27:49.435
The DEA? When?

28:01.748 --> 28:06.185
It isn't enough.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.887
What George is paying you.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.690
It's not worth it.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.827
I'm not who you think I am.

28:14.861 --> 28:18.364
My journey
to this moment was...

28:18.397 --> 28:21.100
ugly.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.903
I was gulping for air
that never came.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.438
You know, graceless.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.075
Until I let go.

28:29.108 --> 28:32.111
But I'm not talking
about me right now.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.613
I'm talking about you.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.050
You know nothing about me.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.586
I know that you suffer.

28:40.619 --> 28:44.023
I can see it in your eyes.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.026
You've lost a lot.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.896
But there's still light in you.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.464
There's goodness in your heart.

28:52.498 --> 28:56.302
But there's only so many stones
that you can hold.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.704
And this-- (exhales)

28:58.737 --> 29:02.074
Yeah, this'll be a big one.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.576
You don't know what
you're talking about.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.246
Yeah, you're wrong.

29:07.279 --> 29:12.118
I know because I've done
the things that you are doing.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.822
And then more.

29:15.855 --> 29:20.592
And I can tell you that it--
it doesn't get any easier.

29:20.626 --> 29:24.964
The pain and the sorrow.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.100
It doesn't ever go away.

29:28.134 --> 29:31.603
Because for everything
that we do in this life...

29:34.841 --> 29:38.978
well, there's a price.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.612
Do you believe in God?

29:43.315 --> 29:45.284
I do.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.657
ROLANDO: Then you know that
what you're about to do

29:51.690 --> 29:53.792
has eternal consequences.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.866
I'm ready to meet my maker.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.934
Because I--

30:01.968 --> 30:03.903
I know where my soul is headed.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.374
Do you?

30:19.585 --> 30:21.753
Hey, come on.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.528
Wait.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.733
He give you his born again,
ex-con bullshit?

30:38.237 --> 30:39.906
We made a deal with King George.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.340
You back out of this job,

30:41.373 --> 30:42.741
Camila won't give you
another one.

30:42.774 --> 30:46.412
This is your shot.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.184
All right, let's go.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.443
(cell phone rings)

31:21.247 --> 31:24.050
Camila, yeah, we're all good
with King George.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.885
JAMES: But the DEA just raided
our warehouse in Dallas.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.621
How did they find it?
Did one of the mules escape?

31:29.655 --> 31:31.257
No, we took care of the mules.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.092
Well, there's a leak somewhere.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.127
I can have our guy
on the inside look into it,

31:35.161 --> 31:36.895
but it's gonna take time.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.965
Tell him we don't have time.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.103
(door closes)

31:45.972 --> 31:48.941
(upbeat music)

31:48.975 --> 31:55.982
*

32:25.177 --> 32:26.745
How is Isabela?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.814
Safe.

32:28.847 --> 32:32.985
In our home,
as she should be.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.621
You look lovely, as always.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.523
I didn't come here
to be flattered.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.426
It's a statement of fact,
nothing more.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.094
I'm here to discuss the book.

32:42.128 --> 32:45.097
I know, Pote told me.
How many of my men

32:45.131 --> 32:47.666
are you going to steal
like a petty little thief?

32:47.699 --> 32:50.636
You can't steal
what's already yours.

32:50.669 --> 32:54.173
Everything I have, I earned.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.342
You turned
my lieutenants against me

32:56.375 --> 32:58.177
with bribes and threats.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.845
They were grown men.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.480
They made their choices.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.216
There's more foot soldiers
where those came from.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.784
Oh, you are a fool
if you think that

33:05.817 --> 33:09.488
trustworthy men
are easy to find.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.390
I don't.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.628
Here. Pages from the book.

33:16.662 --> 33:20.199
It's now in my possession.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.069
If you insist
in coming after me,

33:23.102 --> 33:25.304
I will use it against you.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.207
You are in the wilderness
with nothing,

33:28.240 --> 33:31.577
and still you refuse
to come home.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.579
To play Governor's wife

33:33.612 --> 33:35.914
while you run the business
I built.

33:35.947 --> 33:39.385
Ashes do not scare me,
my love,

33:39.418 --> 33:43.055
no matter how many times
you try to burn me down.

33:43.089 --> 33:46.592
Well, if you insist
on breaking up your family,

33:46.625 --> 33:48.960
we should make it official.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.679
Divorce papers?

34:07.713 --> 34:09.848
A peace treaty.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.751
You sign this,
you stay out of my business,

34:12.784 --> 34:14.120
I'll leave you in peace.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.760
You want to end our marriage.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.929
I never asked you to leave.

34:23.962 --> 34:26.064
And I've always loved you.

34:26.098 --> 34:29.301
But if you don't back down
on the foolish demands

34:29.335 --> 34:35.307
regarding my business,
you leave me no other option.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.576
You think I don't have
the nerve to sign this.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.312
Oh, mi amora,
you have bigger balls

34:40.346 --> 34:41.980
than any man I've ever known.

34:42.013 --> 34:46.418
One thing I never doubted
was your nerve.

34:46.452 --> 34:50.289
Divorce or war.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.825
The choice is yours.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.477
Then war it is.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.502
ANNOUNCER: Police are
investigating the death

35:36.535 --> 35:39.305
of ex-con turned activist
Rolando Rios.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.808
Since being released from
federal prison five years prior,

35:42.841 --> 35:45.877
Rios had been serving
as Pastor of East Houston's

35:45.911 --> 35:47.513
Light of Grace Chapel.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.781
Rios's death serving
as a rallying point

35:49.815 --> 35:51.517
for legalizing marijuana--

35:54.986 --> 35:57.489
The deal with King George
went through.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.990
I'm proud of you.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.193
Thank you.

36:01.227 --> 36:04.563
I'm still not certain you're cut
out for this kind of work.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.237
What's this?

36:11.270 --> 36:14.540
Passport with a fake name.

36:14.573 --> 36:17.876
And enough money
for you to flee.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.679
Epifanio's gonna come after me.

36:20.712 --> 36:25.150
If he finds us together,
he's gonna kill us both.

36:25.183 --> 36:29.321
You're free to leave
if you choose.

36:29.355 --> 36:32.658
When I was a girl,
narcos killed my mother.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.526
I ran from them.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.696
Like I ran from Epifanio
when Guero died.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.030
I'll fight till I die.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.932
But I'm not running anymore.

36:45.271 --> 36:50.609
We can defeat Epifanio.
Are you with me?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.544
I'm with you.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.317
Good decision, Teresa.

37:09.261 --> 37:12.798
I let Teresa inside.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.933
That doesn't mean
she's earned my trust.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.603
She's hiding something.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.638
Find out what it is.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.121
THE QUEEN: Little late
for mercy, don't you think?

37:36.154 --> 37:39.925
It had to be done.
You did well.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.127
(speaking Spanish)

38:07.519 --> 38:11.523
Everything in life has a price.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.525
Brenda was my best friend.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.402
She's never coming back.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.810
It hurts so much.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.717
(crying)

39:01.907 --> 39:03.775
Isabela?

39:06.244 --> 39:09.247
(speaking Spanish)

39:13.419 --> 39:14.720
Where's Isabela?

39:14.753 --> 39:20.392
(speaking Spanish)

39:20.426 --> 39:22.327
Fresh off the bone.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.895
Where's my daughter?

39:23.929 --> 39:25.664
And what have you done
with my guards?

39:25.697 --> 39:30.902
My men will provide
all the security you need.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.504
My men have worked very hard

39:32.538 --> 39:35.607
to prepare this
special meal for you.

39:35.641 --> 39:39.310
Please, join us.

39:51.089 --> 39:56.261
Did you know Batman
came to see me today?

39:56.294 --> 39:58.897
We talked.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.601
Well, Batman
did most of the talking.

40:02.634 --> 40:06.237
More like squealed, actually.

40:14.513 --> 40:17.549
Like a pig.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.652
Like a filthy swine.

40:20.686 --> 40:24.422
Sweating and roasting
in his own juices.

40:38.303 --> 40:42.474
You tried to have me killed.

40:42.508 --> 40:46.011
But I'm gonna let you live, Epi.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.246
Retain your position
in the cartel,

40:48.279 --> 40:51.082
right alongside me.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.652
Just like my Conquistador
forefathers

40:53.685 --> 40:56.354
first offered Moctezuma.

41:05.731 --> 41:08.800
(speaking Spanish)

41:24.650 --> 41:26.317
(speaking Spanish)
