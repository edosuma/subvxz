00:04.588 --> 00:08.092
Oh, I'm sorry. I always forget. People
can't see me unless I want them to see me.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.763
- God...
- Just call me Chuck.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.051
I'm looking for God.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.775
Do you see what's happening?
All your chosen.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.446
They are suffering! Show yourself!

00:20.812 --> 00:21.812
Call me Donatello.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.277
This guy's a prophet?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.360
He had no idea
he was next in line after Kevin...

00:25.442 --> 00:27.882
How would he?
He hadn't gotten hit by the God power yet.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.868
What about Amara? She's your sister.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.957
I took responsibility for her, too.
Locked her away.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.618
So you're just gonna let Amara win?

00:34.826 --> 00:37.454
- How is death by your sister a strategy?
- I know her.

00:37.621 --> 00:38.713
She's gonna eliminate you,

00:38.956 --> 00:40.674
and then she's gonna destroy
everything that you've created.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.296
She's told me this personally.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.961
You need all the help you can get.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.346
The plan is to rescue Lucifer from Amara.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.471
Then he teleports us
out of Amara 's hideout,

00:50.467 --> 00:53.220
and we convince Chuck
to use him to fight her.

00:53.470 --> 00:57.896
And how are we supposed to keep Amara busy
while we're liberating Lucifer?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.981
Where are your thoughts?
Something's different.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.812
All right, Metatron, come on.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.397
It's okay, Sam. You go.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.065
I got this.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.737
The secretary.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.076
Spare the universe.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.365
Spare this.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.229
So, where were you?

01:37.848 --> 01:40.067
That's a long story.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.940
How do you feel? I healed you.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.026
Mmm. Yeah, didn't ask you to.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.028
Son, be reasonable.

01:47.357 --> 01:52.534
One cosmic Band-Aid on my knee
and what? You think that we're even now?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.202
Is it time for us
to go play catch in the yard?

01:56.742 --> 01:58.369
Screw you.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.788
Guys.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.383
Hey, how's it going in here?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.545
Listen, I know I've been gone for a while.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.806
I missed a few million birthdays.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.806
Yeah, and then the second
your apes send a distress flare,

02:15.052 --> 02:16.052
boom, Daddy's home.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.562
No, that's not what happened.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.041
Hey, these "apes" saved your ass.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.404
He can't hurt you.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.065
Oh, so, you're controlling me, now?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.741
No, it's just a safeguard.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.781
Hey, guys. Uh, Chuck.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.114
Lucifer, Dean.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.576
You think we can try and focus here,
you know?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.995
End of the world. Common enemy. All that.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.419
Enemy of my enemy is my friend.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.925
Team Amara. Go, Amara.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.794
You don't mean that.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.464
You're really not gonna say it?

02:56.259 --> 02:58.011
He's not gonna say what?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.683
Screw you.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.935
Screw all of you.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.865
Kids, huh?

03:39.302 --> 03:40.804
Lucifer!

03:41.304 --> 03:43.056
You know, at some point in time,
you're gonna have to come out

03:43.306 --> 03:45.980
and then talk to God.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.523
This is like the worst episode
of Full House ever.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.161
If Dad has something to say
to me, I'll hear it from him.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.746
Until then, I'll be in my room.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.865
- It's not your room.
- It's my room!

04:04.494 --> 04:05.711
Whatever.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.165
We can do this.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.250
Lucifer stole the throne.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.174
But his authority weakens
the longer he's MIA.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.511
The time is ripe for a coup.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.017
That's why I brought you here.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.685
Together, we can reclaim the throne.

04:21.845 --> 04:26.351
Together, we can make Hell great again.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.778
Of course, I'll need your help
recruiting others.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.359
When the numbers are in our favor,

04:36.526 --> 04:37.698
we'll strike.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.536
And each and every one of you
will have earned a place at my side.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.202
Told you he'd do this.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.621
"He"? Do what?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.581
What you always do.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.463
Promise a return to Hell's former glory.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.386
Promises you never make good on.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.888
How about a rundown of your recent rule?

04:57.088 --> 04:59.386
First, you were Rowena's bitch.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.934
Then Dean Winchester's.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.266
Then Amara's. Then Lucifer's.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.892
A few weeks ago,

05:05.096 --> 05:08.566
you were cleaning these floors
with your tongue.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.397
We could retake Hell, but why bother?

05:14.231 --> 05:16.074
The world's ending and this time,

05:16.775 --> 05:18.277
Hell's ending with it.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.792
Unless you've got a plan
to defeat The Darkness.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.341
Well, then, this is just more of the same.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.006
King Crowley's bad dinner theater.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.590
If that's the way you feel,
why did you show?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.595
We wanted to see the monkey dance,
one last time.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.142
Talk to him.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.435
Won't do any good.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.773
- Why not?
- 'Cause I can't give him what he wants.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.609
- And what's that?
- What everyone wants.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.954
My sister, my children, you humans.

06:02.279 --> 06:06.000
An apology. A big, wet, "I'm sorry."

06:06.491 --> 06:07.788
Well, so, give it to him!

06:07.993 --> 06:11.213
It's not like he's asking for a weapon.
Or for Hell or for Heaven.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.839
He's asking for words.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.630
I can't say I'm sorry if I'm not.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.176
What he wants an apology for,
I did it for humanity, for the world.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.843
Look, Lucifer wants what everybody wants,
Amara gone.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.225
Okay? Let's just give him
a little time to cool off.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.855
Okay. Well, I donâ€™t know
if you've noticed,

06:30.056 --> 06:31.936
but a little time
is not something that we have.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.977
The end is freaking nigh.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.325
Hmm.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.504
Rowena.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.007
Door not locked.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.017
What all that astral projection bull for?

07:14.726 --> 07:17.024
We're hardly on the best terms, Clea.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.863
Before barging in,

07:19.189 --> 07:22.534
I just wanted to check
for hex bags, or a...

07:25.528 --> 07:26.575
That.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.873
What you want?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.536
I'm working on a spell.
It requires a second.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.124
A second?

07:37.874 --> 07:42.550
Why don't you ask Charisse
or Melodie or Thomasin?

07:44.923 --> 07:49.144
Oh, yeah, you torched them all
in one of your impetuous little fits.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.223
The world's ending, Clea.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.064
Well, duh.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.903
End times shouldn't bother you,
though, Ro. You're a rat.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.247
Find your way off any sinking ship.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.074
Damn right.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.621
The spell I'm working on
is Book of the Damned magic.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.672
And it can get us back.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.335
We can buy ourselves
a few more centuries of life.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.178
Turn back the clock for us

08:25.088 --> 08:28.513
before the world inevitably goes bye-bye.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.098
You're scared.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.100
Aye.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.859
I came face to face with The Darkness.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.775
The apocalypse bell's been rung
a few times in our day,

08:42.438 --> 08:45.033
but when I looked inside her, I saw it.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.153
Not just the end of the world,
Heaven and Hell.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.788
The end of magic.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.166
Greek antiquity. Or no deal.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.512
Middle Ages.
I know, not the best time to be a witch.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.130
Or a black woman.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.306
And the Greek Age was better?

09:09.799 --> 09:12.393
I'm a fan of the classics.
I'll make it work.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.804
Deal.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.815
One of you is gonna have to, uh, go first.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.644
You know what? Uh, Lucifer, you, uh...

09:21.186 --> 09:24.565
You agreed to have a sit-down
if God would show, so...

09:25.815 --> 09:28.318
And, Chuck, you did say you'd talk.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.244
Him first.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.658
I'm the one who's owed an explanation.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.504
Okay, let's try "I feel" statements.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.677
Dr. Phil. It's... Huh?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.883
Oh, yeah, of course. Please.

09:52.842 --> 09:58.895
I am sorry
that you feel that I betrayed you,

09:59.349 --> 10:01.192
that I acted without cause.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.942
And I'm sorry that you can't see
you gave me no choice.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.404
- I'm good.
- You heard that, right?

10:08.691 --> 10:12.867
We all know that you are God, um,

10:14.531 --> 10:17.876
but, maybe, could you be
a little less lordly?

10:19.077 --> 10:21.375
- But I am the Lord.
- Wow.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.712
- There he goes.
- I did what I had to do.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.711
To create the world,
I had to lock Amara away.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.387
And when the Mark corrupted you,

10:29.879 --> 10:32.719
and I saw that you posed a threat
to humankind, I did the same with you.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.555
No, you betrayed me.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.387
You gave me the Mark to lock her away,

10:37.595 --> 10:41.725
and when it changed me,
when it did what the Mark inevitably does,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.436
- you threw me away.
- No, son. The Mark...

10:46.146 --> 10:50.071
You always cast
a jaundiced glance at humans.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.447
The Mark didn't change you.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.658
It just made you more
of what you already were.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.407
What I was, was your son.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.907
Your child.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.248
Why should I put you first
above all others?

11:02.412 --> 11:03.692
You have any idea what it's like

11:03.746 --> 11:07.091
to argue with your father
when your father is God?

11:09.127 --> 11:12.256
Everything is a tautology with you.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.678
Everything is, "Because I told you so."

11:14.924 --> 11:16.926
Everything's, "It had to be done."

11:17.260 --> 11:19.354
Pretty sure that's all fathers.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.643
Okay.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.811
Fine.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.981
Big picture, as God,
you did what you had to do.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.033
But little picture?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.445
You sucked at being a dad.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.790
Okay, maybe I didn't
handle everything perfectly.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.793
But tell me.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.338
Could I have kept humankind safe
with you on the board?

11:47.165 --> 11:50.544
I know about your little bid
to replace me with the angels.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.306
Okay, "New God,"
what would you have done about you?

11:54.631 --> 11:56.554
That is not the point.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.980
I can't believe
I'm actually about to say this,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.150
but Lucifer is right.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.813
All he wants is an apology.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.988
And you're too concerned
about being right to give him one.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.322
But apologies aren't always
about being right.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.158
Sometimes they're just about apologizing.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.329
Yeah, and the great thing about apologies
is you don't have to mean them.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.332
You know? I lie
and tell Sam I'm sorry all the time.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.090
I'm sorry.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.713
See? That's...

12:35.004 --> 12:36.847
Okay. Enough from the peanut gallery.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.770
What?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.685
What would you have done?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.190
It doesn't matter.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.742
You were my father and you forsook me.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.456
I did.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.374
I was supposed to love
all creation equally.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.212
I wasn't supposed to have favorites.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.127
But you,

13:16.129 --> 13:17.722
you were mine.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.311
I gave you the Mark
because I loved you the most.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.677
Because I thought
you were strong enough to bear it.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.813
And when I saw that I was wrong,

13:35.898 --> 13:38.071
when I watched my choice

13:39.235 --> 13:40.578
devour my

13:42.405 --> 13:44.248
most cherished son,

13:47.243 --> 13:48.961
I hated myself.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.425
And so I punished you.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.427
And I am so sorry.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.441
Hey.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.283
So, are we good?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.953
- Okay. Great.
- So, what now?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.958
We trap Amara.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.794
Put her back in the box.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.120
Wait, what?

14:31.287 --> 14:34.131
Yeah. Well, you were right,
she needs to be destroyed.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.127
- But I won't kill her.
- And why not?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.467
Amara's been caged for billions of years,

14:41.297 --> 14:44.642
but, you know, she was always there.
She had to be there.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.721
You know, Yin and Yang.
You know, dark and light.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.681
English, Chuck.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.148
There's a harmony,
a balance in the universe.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.734
Light needs dark, dark needs light.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.362
If you blow one of them up,
then, I mean...

15:04.654 --> 15:05.774
It wouldn't be a good thing.

15:05.822 --> 15:10.328
It'd be really not a good thing.
Like "end of reality" not good.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.086
Okay, so we gift wrap Amara.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.580
I mean, we've got
the team back together, so...

15:13.830 --> 15:17.334
Not quite. We're still a few members short
of the original line-up.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.670
Yeah, first time,
it took the combined strength

15:19.836 --> 15:24.182
of me and my brothers to weaken Amara
before Daddy-o finished her off.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.009
Yeah. Even then it was close.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.554
Now, with just the two of us, we'll lose.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.105
Okay. So, what? We need more group therapy

15:31.347 --> 15:33.020
between you and the archangels
if we want to have a shot?

15:33.182 --> 15:35.355
Well, Michael's in no condition to fight.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.439
And it's outside of my power
to bring Gabriel and Raphael back.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.611
But you restored Castiel.

15:40.898 --> 15:44.402
Archangels are different,
they're the stuff of primordial creation.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.697
Rebuilding them, that's...
It's time we don't have.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.871
All right. So, what do you need to win?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.620
What do you got?

15:58.916 --> 16:02.716
So, what do we bring to the table
to make up for archangel power?

16:04.046 --> 16:07.220
- We could try and find more Hands of God?
- Little redundant.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.728
- Right.
- What about Crowley?

16:11.262 --> 16:14.766
Demon power. Former King of Hell.
He was a player in his day.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.564
Stealing my moves, Dean?

16:22.565 --> 16:26.490
Let me guess.
You got Lucifer back in the fold.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.112
He snapped you here.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.244
No. It wasn't Lucifer.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.074
Uh-uh-uh.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.245
It's time to sober up.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.841
You smell like a dumpster
outside the Liquor Barn.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.257
What's this? Concern for me?

16:44.629 --> 16:48.099
I appreciate your attempts
at bromantic rekindling,

16:48.466 --> 16:50.764
but I think we'd both agree,
that ship has sailed.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.470
It's not what this is about.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.858
We need your help.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.769
We have the angels.

16:59.936 --> 17:03.031
And here I thought
I had made real inroads with you guys.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.945
- You thought wrong, Serpent.
- "Serpent?"

17:06.150 --> 17:08.949
We loathe you, will always loathe you.

17:09.862 --> 17:15.210
Welp, I came here to ask
a good faith favor of you folks,

17:15.451 --> 17:20.127
but as you are clearly
less than kindly disposed,

17:20.330 --> 17:25.804
perhaps, you'll lend an ear
to my very own Jiminy Cricket? Hmm?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.986
Hello, brothers.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.239
Sisters.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.657
Castiel?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.413
It's me.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.497
Do you think we see any daylight
between you and the Adversary?

17:59.245 --> 18:02.545
Rowena. I mean, she's a snake,
but she's a powerful witch.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.049
And she's got the Book of the Damned.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.673
We've got the owl feather?
The yarrow root?

18:06.836 --> 18:07.883
Check and check.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.680
- A jaw of pig?
- Check.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.516
What are you doing here, giant?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.682
- Give it.
- Not till we've talked.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.064
You walked right into a powerful coven!

18:22.685 --> 18:24.232
It takes three for a coven.

18:24.854 --> 18:28.028
Witches' den, without a weapon.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.361
I'll turn you into a moose,
an actual moose.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.694
You can't.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.411
Read his aura.
He under some potent protection.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.075
Never seen that before.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.040
Hear the man out.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.880
Well?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.544
We need you.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.879
Getting these groups to enlist
and then work together?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.881
- It's not gonna be easy.
- Couldn't you just compel them?

18:52.423 --> 18:54.266
I invented free will for a reason.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.152
So, we're tying our hands on principle?

18:56.385 --> 18:59.229
No, you can't make
an effective soldier by force.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.731
They have to choose this fight.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.401
But they're gonna wanna know
they're backing a winner.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.066
So?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.572
So......

19:09.565 --> 19:11.158
We're gonna play the God card.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.571
"God's back."

19:15.404 --> 19:18.578
You've tricked me before, Samuel.
Why'd I believe a word you say?

19:18.783 --> 19:21.286
It would explain
that aura of protection.

19:21.744 --> 19:22.996
Not no regular magic.

19:23.746 --> 19:27.250
Clea, dear, is this how
it's going to be with us in Crete?

19:31.462 --> 19:34.432
Even if God's back, why would I care?

19:34.757 --> 19:36.259
Hello, Pagan here.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.469
I serve magic, not God.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.096
Sorry.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.181
- Not interested.
- I am.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.024
What? I can't serve both?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.939
Let's hear it from him.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.825
In good time.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.365
Do I have your support?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.447
I can't even look at you, Castiel.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.954
You befouled yourself with the Deceiver.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.291
You know, every second that I've spent
subordinating myself to Lucifer,

20:08.666 --> 20:10.134
it's been a torment.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.805
It's destroying me.
It's burning through my vessel.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.716
But I would do it all over again.

20:17.466 --> 20:22.973
Because, through me, he and God,
they will defeat The Darkness.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.401
That's my role in this fight.
It's God's fight.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.657
You can play a part in that fight, too.
If you join me.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.571
No!

20:38.821 --> 20:41.370
Ro, you brought me a plan to escape.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.580
This here's an opportunity
to fight and win.

20:43.826 --> 20:47.205
- She's right.
- Nobody's talking to you, Big and Tall.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.173
I can enlist others.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.712
Sister witches.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.719
You're mad.
We don't stand a chance against Amara!

20:54.503 --> 20:58.679
Rowena, honey, there is a chance.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.394
Game of thrones? It's musical chairs.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.232
Still, I wanted it.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.186
To go out with the crown on my head.

21:10.394 --> 21:14.615
And that's what you offered them,
a chance to stroke your ego?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.200
And you wonder why they said no?

21:18.569 --> 21:20.537
Well, we've got something better.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.118
A plan.

21:23.199 --> 21:27.204
Now, you can sit on the sidelines
and watch the world die,

21:28.537 --> 21:30.084
or you can fight.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.876
You know, to be King again,

21:34.210 --> 21:37.054
maybe you need to remember
how to be a soldier.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.967
What's the plan?

21:41.383 --> 21:44.144
We assemble our band of brothers.
Hit Amara with everything we've got.

21:44.220 --> 21:47.064
- Then, when she's weak...
- I finish her off.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.230
So a page from the original playbook.

21:50.559 --> 21:55.065
This time with witches and demons
subbing for archangels.

21:55.898 --> 21:56.899
Exactly.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.738
I still don't like it.

22:00.611 --> 22:03.080
But why trap her when you can kill her?

22:03.239 --> 22:04.866
You know? I mean, you gotta admit,

22:05.074 --> 22:07.234
there's a lot less room for error
if you shoot to kill.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.585
I explained why.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.422
Right. But why keep her in play?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.379
So she can escape
and we can go through this all over again?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.130
Dean, what is this about?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.545
Nothing. Am I the only one
thinking rational here?

22:18.712 --> 22:19.759
It's about her.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.383
Sam, it's about his girlfriend.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.935
Okay. Shut up.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.770
I mean, think about it.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.726
Dean Winchester meets
the biggest evil in the universe,

22:30.933 --> 22:32.185
and he takes a pass.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.565
Come on.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.783
Now he wants Daddy to do what he couldn't.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.153
Is he right?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.860
I'm not getting into it with him.
Not gonna happen.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.194
Hey, Dean.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.701
Come on, what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.782
We opened a vein for you two.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.036
I tried 110 kill her.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.421
And it didn't work.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.140
Maybe it didn't work
because you didn't want it to work.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.762
Maybe you didn't want to kill her.

23:08.846 --> 23:14.194
You want God to kill Amara
because you don't want Amara to be killed?

23:15.978 --> 23:18.259
Yeah, maybe there's a part of me
that just can't hurt her.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.904
But if she's already dead...

23:21.150 --> 23:23.244
Then she's already dead. Right.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.155
Well, that got weird.

23:30.284 --> 23:35.381
Dean, we always sweat this stuff,
these choices.

23:36.582 --> 23:40.303
But for once, we have God on our side.

23:41.503 --> 23:46.384
I mean, for once,
we can actually just do things his way.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.522
- That's...
- That's a very simple plan.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.821
Simple, bordering on insane.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.743
It's suicide.

24:04.944 --> 24:05.991
That's right.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.613
Still in?

24:07.821 --> 24:09.198
Let's go.

24:21.669 --> 24:25.845
Please, I don't know anything!
I've only been a prophet for three days!

24:26.256 --> 24:28.224
But you know where he is.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.521
I won't tell you.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.899
You won't have to.

24:56.578 --> 24:57.795
Kansas.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.395
I don't hold grudges.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.776
Besides, that dog collar
was a lovely touch.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.029
Really made my eyes pop.
Almost wore it here today.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.327
Oh, I'm glad you're such a good sport.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.154
Hey, Red.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.122
Looking gorgeous as ever.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.452
Hey, I think a little apology is in order.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.584
You think you're the first man
to try and kill me?

26:23.165 --> 26:25.042
Hello, Fergus.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.460
Mother.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.969
Hello, my children.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.722
Him?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.729
Rowena. Crowley.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.393
It's good to finally meet you in person.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.570
Sorry about, well,

26:45.854 --> 26:47.948
everything I've ever done
in my life, really.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.616
You can't have been a fan.

26:49.817 --> 26:53.321
Oh, yeah, I've been quietly rooting
against you both for some time now.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.750
Although, I can't deny,
you're one of my guilty pleasures.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.995
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.922
- All right, no flirting. And no fighting.
- Yeah. And no deals.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.047
No talks about who's owed what
if we survive this.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.712
Nobody likes each other,
it doesn't matter.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.551
We only have the fight ahead.

27:11.839 --> 27:15.969
Amara's looking for me,
but I'm warded against her, for now.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.729
The second I drop the warding,
she'll show.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.441
She'll be expecting a fight,
and we'll give it to her.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.230
Shock and awe.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.277
Shock and awe!

27:27.187 --> 27:28.939
You have your troops in position?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.325
Yes, Rowena.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.741
Fabulous plan, God,

27:36.446 --> 27:39.575
but doesn't this strategy strike anyone
as a wee bit un-strategic?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.877
Shouldn't we at least
try to catch her off guard?

27:42.077 --> 27:43.624
Is that sequence set in stone?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.581
"Demon, angel, witch power."

27:45.789 --> 27:47.962
It seems to me that the first response

27:48.167 --> 27:50.295
should come from
the most disposable force.

27:50.586 --> 27:54.432
All right, good argument, Doggie.
Demons first, it is.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.809
The weakest should go first.
Naturally, that means the witches.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.094
Enough.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.351
After that, it's Lucifer's turn.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.353
Physical attack, one-on-one.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.025
What about Cass?

28:05.559 --> 28:09.530
Oh, don't worry. Your pet's safety
is my highest concern.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.695
Trust me, he's on board.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.573
Once she's been weakened,

28:14.943 --> 28:19.289
I will take the Mark back from Amara
and use it to seal her away.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.579
You ready?

28:21.783 --> 28:23.000
Yeah.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.837
Wait, what?

28:27.331 --> 28:30.255
God and I talked about this.
Someone needs to bear the Mark.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.548
Well, that should be me.
I've had it before, I'm damaged goods.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.389
Exactly. You've already been tainted.
I can't transfer it to you.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.262
Sam volunteered.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.810
First, Cass making kamikaze side-plans,
and now you?

28:48.018 --> 28:50.146
- You couldn't have talked to me?
- We did talk.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.028
And what happens
when the Mark turns you psycho? Then what?

28:53.273 --> 28:56.447
You lock me up where I can't hurt anyone,
and you throw away the key.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.812
- Sam, no.
- Dean, you told me

28:57.861 --> 28:59.704
you couldn't beat Amara,
that it would have to be me.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.873
Well, this is it. Me.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.372
I'm just saying, angels can hurt her.
It's worked before.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.799
If you call giving Amara
a mild case of the pukes "working."

29:11.041 --> 29:13.715
We're trying to disorientate her
as much as hurt her.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.464
You underestimate witchcraft,
Fergus, always have.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.511
If anything, she's inoculated.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.473
Full-scale demon attack.
That's our x-factor.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.182
We've talked about this.
It's time to do the smart thing.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.431
So, what am I supposed to do?
Just sit by and watch?

29:29.559 --> 29:32.529
No. We're both in this fight.
You're leading this army.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.611
What, you mean babysitting the bad guys?

29:39.403 --> 29:40.655
Okay, Sam.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.077
Okay.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.371
God's plan.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.396
Hello, Amara.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.772
Hello, witch.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.440
How did you find me?

30:17.274 --> 30:21.245
Been inside your head once before.
Easy enough to find my way back.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.488
Take it you're still looking for God?

30:23.697 --> 30:26.246
Well, I 'm with him right now.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.555
He's here?

30:47.596 --> 30:50.190
Yes. Right inside.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.436
Our deal holds?

30:53.727 --> 30:55.695
Safe passage back in time?

30:57.356 --> 31:00.530
I went out on a limb for you.
Betrayed God of all people.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.361
You didn't betray God.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.946
You betrayed me.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.207
I knew this was a trap
the moment you called.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.413
I didn't care.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.631
All I've ever wanted
is a one-on-one with my brother.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.722
And you've just given it to me.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.142
The question is,

31:28.053 --> 31:30.727
how am I going to repay you?

31:36.269 --> 31:38.317
That tickles.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.909
Do you really think
the power of one witch can hurt me?

31:43.318 --> 31:45.412
I'm not just one witch.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.119
Argh!

31:58.667 --> 32:00.010
Enough.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.775
Points for trying.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.201
No!

33:07.402 --> 33:08.904
Get back!

33:09.070 --> 33:11.164
No! No!

33:11.364 --> 33:13.412
No!

34:02.791 --> 34:04.293
Hello, brother.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.590
You cheated.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.639
Again.

34:13.635 --> 34:14.726
But...

34:29.067 --> 34:30.068
Ah!

34:30.569 --> 34:31.570
Son.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.335
I'm sorry.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.623
For this.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.079
For everything.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.257
An apology at last.

34:48.168 --> 34:51.297
What's "sorry" to me?

34:52.757 --> 34:56.933
I spent millions of years
crammed into that cage.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.770
Alone and afraid.

35:01.308 --> 35:05.358
Wishing, begging for death because of you!

35:06.521 --> 35:09.525
What was my crime, brother?

35:09.941 --> 35:13.036
The world needed to be born!

35:14.195 --> 35:15.697
And you wouldn't let me!

35:17.198 --> 35:18.700
Amara, you gave me no choice!

35:18.908 --> 35:22.037
That's your story, not mine.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.541
The real reason you banished me,

35:25.832 --> 35:28.551
why I couldn't be allowed to exist.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.214
You couldn't stand it.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.889
Yeah, we were equals.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.684
We weren't great or powerful,

35:39.888 --> 35:42.858
because we stood
only in relation to each other.

35:46.061 --> 35:49.235
You think you made
the archangels to bring light?

35:50.231 --> 35:51.278
No.

35:52.359 --> 35:55.238
You made them to create lesser beings,

35:55.904 --> 35:58.373
to make you large,

35:59.407 --> 36:01.080
to make you Lord.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.912
It was ego!

36:04.120 --> 36:06.088
You wanted to be big!

36:10.251 --> 36:11.594
That's true.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.268
But it isn't the whole truth.

36:20.804 --> 36:24.559
There's a value, a glory in creation

36:25.767 --> 36:29.112
that's greater and truer
than my pride or my ego.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.316
Call it grace, call it being.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.155
Whatever it is,
it didn't come from my hands.

36:35.443 --> 36:39.073
It was there, waiting to be born!

36:40.281 --> 36:43.581
It just is, as you and I just were.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.921
Since you've been freed,
I know that you've seen it.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.759
Felt it.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.145
It didn't have to be like this.

37:04.264 --> 37:06.938
I loved you, brother.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.699
Well...

37:20.780 --> 37:22.282
You've won again.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.870
Finish it.

37:28.288 --> 37:29.540
Kill me.

37:33.334 --> 37:36.713
I'm sorry.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.135
No.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.888
No. No!

37:53.688 --> 37:54.985
I'm so sorry.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.324
No. Not again!

37:59.652 --> 38:01.495
Not ever again!

38:08.661 --> 38:10.663
Goodbye, nephew.

38:11.664 --> 38:12.711
Cass!

38:17.420 --> 38:19.718
I'd die a million times,

38:20.340 --> 38:24.061
murder you a million more
before going back there!

38:28.848 --> 38:29.940
Tell me,

38:31.267 --> 38:34.362
if you won't change, why should I?

38:35.355 --> 38:36.732
Amara, no!

38:47.242 --> 38:49.370
Sorry, brother.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.877
- Amara, what have you done?
- He's dead.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.297
- God's dead.
- No.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.632
He's dying.

39:51.139 --> 39:56.817
My brother will dim
and fade away into nothing.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.492
But not until he sees what comes next.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.165
Not until he watches this world,

40:13.912 --> 40:15.755
everything he created,

40:16.247 --> 40:19.877
everything he loves turn to ash.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.938
Welcome to the end.
