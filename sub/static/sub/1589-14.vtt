00:01.360 --> 00:02.691
ANNOUNCER: Previously...

00:02.730 --> 00:05.119
I'm already number one
on her hit list.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.195
If Alison finds out
I'm siding with you guys,

00:07.240 --> 00:09.037
I'm afraid to think of
how far she'd go to stop me.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.332
You think that Alison's "A"?

00:11.370 --> 00:13.076
Hello.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.771
If I try to tell Mike that Mona
isn't what he's looking for...

00:14.810 --> 00:17.199
You won't be able to separate
them with a crowbar.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.376
I'm Mrs. Grunwald.

00:18.410 --> 00:19.342
Ali was calling Grunwald

00:19.380 --> 00:21.371
because she believed
that she could help her.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.580
What kind of help
could you give her?

00:22.620 --> 00:25.214
I have a gift of insight.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.683
What's wrong?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.688
My parents want me to come
to California after Christmas.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.325
This letter proves
Alison knew Bethany.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.327
It could create
enough reasonable doubt

00:32.360 --> 00:33.691
to clear Spencer.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.823
The investigation
is ongoing,

00:35.860 --> 00:37.361
although we did not
find a body.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.231
The amount of blood
in the house would indicate

00:39.270 --> 00:40.669
that the victim's wounds
were fatal.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.634
Mona Vanderwaal
was murdered.

01:00.220 --> 01:02.825
They know that thing's
empty, right?

01:02.860 --> 01:05.579
_ It's a casket
and It still weIghs a ton.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.451
Mona's mom put
keepsakes in it.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.491
Stuffed animals,
photo albums,

01:10.530 --> 01:11.792
old retainer.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.468
It's called a cenotaph.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.264
They have them for soldiers
whose bodies are never found.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.335
Never say never, Spence.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.304
It's been over
three months, Han,

01:20.340 --> 01:22.547
no body,
no murder weapon.

01:22.580 --> 01:23.842
And no arrest.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.417
Well,
present company excluded.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.748
Let's not forget
I'm still
an alleged murderer.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.487
Hey, don't lose faith,
okay?

01:31.520 --> 01:34.182
That letter Bethany sent Ali
could still make a difference.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.780
No, not if Holbrook
has anything to say about it.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.855
We should've told Tanner
about him and Ali months ago.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.652
Tanner won't believe it

01:39.700 --> 01:41.395
coming from you
or anyone else.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.795
She's gonna have
to figure it
out on her own.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.569
I'm gonna go
and get the car.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.498
Okay.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.478
What the hell is
she doing here?

01:52.510 --> 01:54.535
Showing up to your
victim's funeral?

01:54.580 --> 01:56.275
Classy.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.198
You guys, we have
to get her out of here.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.512
Mrs. Vanderwaal?

02:04.620 --> 02:06.588
I came to pay my respects.

02:07.790 --> 02:08.859
And to tell you,
one more time,

02:08.890 --> 02:10.357
that I had nothing
to do with your--

02:10.390 --> 02:12.221
Then where is my daughter?

02:13.560 --> 02:15.118
Where is her body?

02:18.330 --> 02:19.695
It's okay.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.458
Come with me.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.340
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

02:35.380 --> 02:37.883
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:37.920 --> 02:40.514
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:40.560 --> 02:42.881
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:42.930 --> 02:44.921
* If I show you
then I know *

02:44.960 --> 02:47.929
* You won't tell
what I said *

02:47.960 --> 02:50.520
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:50.570 --> 02:52.788
* If one of them is dead

02:59.610 --> 03:01.202
Mrs. Vanderwaal?

03:01.240 --> 03:03.379
I put a load
in the dishwasher.

03:04.780 --> 03:07.510
Do you need any help
folding the chairs?

03:07.550 --> 03:09.609
No.
Thank you, Hanna.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.483
Is there anything
that you need?
No, it's all right.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.680
Then I think I'll go.

03:16.890 --> 03:20.621
I'm sorry
about what happened
at the service.

03:23.970 --> 03:28.498
It was just her...

03:28.540 --> 03:32.601
Alison, alive.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.841
People understand.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.871
It's like Mona
was lost at sea.

03:41.780 --> 03:45.284
I accept that she's dead.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.651
My daughter is dead.

03:48.590 --> 03:49.750
But where is she?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.923
An empty casket...
what was I thinking?

03:56.770 --> 04:00.433
I think that you were trying
to find a way to say goodbye.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.628
We all are.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.434
And that funeral probably
helped a lot of people.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.644
I hope it helped someone.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.608
I'll just go fold those chairs
before I go.

04:21.860 --> 04:22.986
Hanna.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.750
I want you
to take care of this.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.601
Hi.
Hey.

04:41.580 --> 04:42.399
How are you doing?

04:42.450 --> 04:45.499
I heard what happened
at the church.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.676
Oh.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.711
It was so ghastly.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.513
Hanna stopped
Mona's mom,

04:50.550 --> 04:53.348
but_we all wanted to stuff A"
Into that empty coffin.

04:53.390 --> 04:54.482
I should
have been there.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.648
No, really, we wanted
to do it on our own.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.066
Mom's not here.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.091
Well, I know.

05:06.130 --> 05:08.564
She called me,
asked me to come by.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.865
Why? What happened?

05:13.810 --> 05:15.903
Bethany Young's parents
have petitioned the court

05:15.940 --> 05:18.647
to have your bail revoked.
Okay.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.375
They've been trying
to do that for months.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.116
Yes, but this time,
it may work.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.742
Why?

05:24.790 --> 05:27.088
They unsealed
your indictment today.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.054
We finally know
why you were arrested.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.395
Ah, it's an open file.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.533
I didn't break any rules
looking at it.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.960
What you're looking
for isn't there.
It's here.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.729
The grounds
for Spencer Hastings'
arrest warrant.

05:50.780 --> 05:53.772
That was unsealed today.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.139
What convinced the judge

05:55.180 --> 05:57.444
was a statement
from a wntness.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.708
Someone who_ saw
Spencer Hastings

05:59.760 --> 06:01.853
in the DiLaurentis
backyard with a girl,

06:01.890 --> 06:04.757
a blonde dressed
in Alison's clothes,

06:04.790 --> 06:07.497
the night that
Bethany was buried
in that yard.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.895
Who was the witness?

06:08.930 --> 06:10.898
Jessica DiLaurentis.

06:10.930 --> 06:13.034
Mrs. DiLaurentis
saw Spencer

06:13.070 --> 06:14.890
in the backyard
and told the police?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.904
Where's the statement
been for two years?

06:18.940 --> 06:21.033
Where it has been
is deliberately hidden

06:21.080 --> 06:22.775
in the files of the officer

06:22.810 --> 06:25.040
who took the statement,
Darren Wilden.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.514
We found it
just before Thanksgiving.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.814
Wilden had suppressed it.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.989
He may have
buried the statement,

06:33.020 --> 06:35.580
but Mrs. D. was still alive.

06:35.620 --> 06:39.454
What stopped her
from telling someone else?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.593
Why do you think she didn't?

06:42.700 --> 06:43.792
Wilden was crooked.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.764
He told somebody
about the statement,

06:45.800 --> 06:47.836
somebody who'd want it
to go away,

06:47.870 --> 06:50.634
and they paid him to keep
Mrs. DiLaurentis quiet.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.539
How do you suppose
he could do that?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.707
Well, Bethany was
a patient at Radley.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.708
Mrs. DiLaurentis
was on the board.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.514
She had an affair
with Bethany's father.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.541
That's probably
where they met.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.718
It always seems
to lead back to Radley,
doesn't it?

07:08.790 --> 07:09.825
Where's your partner?

07:09.860 --> 07:11.725
Oh, Detective Holbrook?

07:11.760 --> 07:13.648
He's out_
on temporary assngnment.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.722
EZRA: Once it's all done,
this will all be bookshelves.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.568
Oh, looks good...

07:21.600 --> 07:23.830
in a
"has to get really messy

07:23.870 --> 07:25.758
before it gets
clean" kind of way.

07:25.810 --> 07:26.572
Yeah.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.737
Well, I appreciate
your optimism.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.873
But I think you need
to get your eyes checked.

07:30.910 --> 07:34.209
Have you heard from Oberlin?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.070
No.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.611
No, I haven't yet.

07:38.650 --> 07:40.015
Maybe tomorrow.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.689
Have you heard from Mike
since the funeral?

07:46.760 --> 07:47.852
I kind of lost track of him

07:47.900 --> 07:50.721
after the slap heard
around the world.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.896
Why?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.137
I'm just wondering
how he's doing.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.797
Mona_was a lot
of complicated things

07:55.840 --> 07:56.932
to a lot of different people,

07:56.970 --> 07:59.837
but she was just
one thing to Mike.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.177
He loved her...

08:02.810 --> 08:06.177
and I was the one
who tried to screw it up,

08:06.210 --> 08:07.814
twice.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.613
He doesn't want
to talk to me about her.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.710
I could try.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.751
I could say that I need
help with my bookshelves.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.883
You do need help
with your bookshelves.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.023
See, it's a win-win.

08:23.300 --> 08:27.088
Did you finish packing?
Yes.

08:31.010 --> 08:31.908
I thought three months,

08:31.940 --> 08:33.828
I'd get used
to the idea of you leaving...

08:36.110 --> 08:38.601
but I haven't.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.242
Neither have I.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.811
You'll miss graduation.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.683
My parents say
that's just a technicality.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.785
And prom.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.799
That was a technicality
I was looking forward to.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.867
Maybe if we talked
to your parents one more time.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.993
They can't hear anything.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.905
I have enough credits
to leave early

09:02.940 --> 09:05.033
and that's all that counts.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.901
They want me
someplace safe.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.101
California has earthquakes.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.811
I pointed that out.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.977
It didn't work though.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.013
I'll take you
to the airport.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.586
My parents will take me.
You don't have to do that.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.985
I don't have to, I want to.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.564
What?

09:39.210 --> 09:41.929
I heard a song
the other day.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.948
Old song.

09:43.980 --> 09:48.144
The girl says,
"Your eyes.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.785
It's a day's work
just to look into them."

09:56.960 --> 09:58.928
So you stayed
with Mona's mom

09:58.960 --> 10:00.894
after the others left.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.296
Yeah.
We cleaned up,

10:03.330 --> 10:06.026
and she told me
how she wished

10:06.070 --> 10:08.129
she'd have done more when
Mona told her about Alison.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.038
Oh, God, I wanted
to crawl under a rug.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.968
We pushed her
to help us.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.672
Look, Mona was on Ali's
radar long before that.

10:17.710 --> 10:20.110
I still felt awful.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.984
Any luck with that?

10:24.020 --> 10:25.942
Well,

10:25.990 --> 10:29.050
I know why Mona wasn't afraid
to let me keep it.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.819
It is completely
encrypted and secured

10:30.860 --> 10:33.090
unlike anything
I've ever seen.

10:33.130 --> 10:34.688
The only thing
I know for sure

10:34.730 --> 10:37.096
is that there are chunks
of that hard drive

10:37.130 --> 10:38.768
that I'm completely
locked out of.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.732
Well, if she went
to all that trouble,

10:39.770 --> 10:41.431
there must be something
important in there.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.904
I'm not giving up.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.760
My ego's at stake now.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.702
What do you think
A" did with Mona's body?

10:52.210 --> 10:55.270
Ali's the only one
with that information.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.140
I don't see her making that
public knowledge.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.018
Maybe there's
somebody else who knows,

11:02.060 --> 11:04.381
or somebody
that could find out.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.318
VVho?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.325
Mrs. Grunwald.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.831
Not a good idea.

11:16.870 --> 11:20.101
But she's a psychic.
A real psychic.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.233
She's not some card
fleper at the carnival.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.305
She has a real gift
and we both know it.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.739
You can't mess around
with that stuff.

11:26.780 --> 11:27.769
Believe me.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.310
Well, then,
who else do we ask?

11:29.350 --> 11:33.116
She saved Ali
when Mrs. D. planted her.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.048
She knows all of us,

11:35.090 --> 11:37.058
and she seems
to lIke us In some

11:37.090 --> 11:39.354
disturbing,
creepy sort of way.

11:39.390 --> 11:41.426
It is not like Lo-Jack.
Okay?

11:41.460 --> 11:43.963
You cannot just call her up
and ask where's the body.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.289
And even
if she could tell you,

11:46.330 --> 11:48.161
how are you going to explain
to Mrs. Vanderwaal

11:48.200 --> 11:50.339
where you got the information,
or the police?

11:51.940 --> 11:53.999
And I know how you feel
about Mona's mom,

11:54.040 --> 11:56.429
but calling Grunwald
is not going to help anybody.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.261
Bad news?

12:21.140 --> 12:23.062
You don't have to do that.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.099
Do what?

12:24.140 --> 12:25.869
Run from me.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.207
Be afraid.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.207
If you want me
to believe you're not

12:28.240 --> 12:31.004
who I think you are,
you will leave us all alone.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.109
God, it's like you went
to sleep one night

12:33.150 --> 12:34.117
and forgot who I am.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.381
I know exactly
who you are, "A."

12:37.420 --> 12:38.409
Stop saying that.

12:38.450 --> 12:39.815
Why should I?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.282
You're "A."

12:41.320 --> 12:43.880
You stole the game from Mona
and then you killed her
because she had proof.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.285
And you killed Bethany
because you were jealous
of a mental patient.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.399
That's how crazy you are.

12:47.430 --> 12:48.454
Listen to me, Aria.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.119
Bethany's family is talking
to the judges right now.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.811
It could be today,
it could be tomorrow.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.147
I mean, my mom is
at the courthouse,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.987
she's trying
to fight it, but...

13:12.020 --> 13:13.453
Spencer,
that's crazy, okay.

13:13.490 --> 13:14.957
They can't just
revoke your bail.

13:14.990 --> 13:15.786
Well, we have
to do something.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.288
What?
We found a letter
from Bethany

13:18.330 --> 13:20.423
explaining the matching clothes,
explaining everything,

13:20.460 --> 13:22.997
and Holbrook is doing
whatever he can
to get it thrown out,

13:23.030 --> 13:25.396
to make sure that it looks
like I forged the whole thing.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.091
But Mona found out
that All hit Bethany

13:27.140 --> 13:28.869
with that shovel
and was murdered for it.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.505
So if we can prove
that All killed Mona,

13:31.540 --> 13:34.077
the cops will realize that
these two crimes are connected,

13:34.110 --> 13:35.429
that one motivated
the other,

13:35.480 --> 13:37.038
that you are innocent.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.446
If it were easy to prove
that Ali's a murderer,

13:39.480 --> 13:40.515
wouldn't we have
done that already?

13:40.550 --> 13:42.108
If Mona can find
proof, so can we.

13:42.150 --> 13:43.219
I mean, it's got to be
somewhere, right?

13:44.590 --> 13:46.512
How's Caleb doing
with her laptop?

13:46.550 --> 13:49.280
He's not giving up,
but he's not getting
anywhere either.

13:49.320 --> 13:53.359
Guys, as long as All has
an alibi, she's untouchable.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.550
So then
we tear down her alibi.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.227
Her dad won't budge.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.261
I'm not talking
about her dad.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.901
Hey, I didn't see you
at the cemetery yesterday.
Did you leave early?

14:11.210 --> 14:13.041
I guess.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.048
You did.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.216
Okay.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.342
Any reason?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.021
It wasn't a real funeral.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.483
No?

14:26.530 --> 14:28.157
No body,
no funeral.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.328
Does that make you upset?

14:32.370 --> 14:33.962
I'm just...

14:34.000 --> 14:37.265
I'm trying to get a sense
of how this all makes you feel.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.904
You look up how to talk
to me online or something?

14:39.940 --> 14:41.498
I feel like I don't
want to talk to you

14:41.540 --> 14:43.144
about my dead girlfriend.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.341
I just wasn't sure
you thought

14:45.380 --> 14:46.506
she was actually gone.

14:48.350 --> 14:51.911
No one loses that much blood
and lives to tell the story.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.952
You aren't acting
like you've lost someone.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.657
How would you
like me to act?

14:59.690 --> 15:01.351
You want me to cry
my eyes out?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.925
Bang my fists on the wall?
She's gone.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.666
That's it.
People leave. People die.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.669
It's the only sure thing
there is in this world.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.984
Thank you for coming.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.481
Thank you
for remembering me.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.215
You're hard to forget.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.286
I take that as a compliment.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.692
There's no one in there.
It's empty.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.595
I know.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.161
Well, how is it you think
I can help you?

15:45.740 --> 15:48.174
I want you to help me
find the body of the girl

15:48.210 --> 15:49.472
that's supposed to be
in that box.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.439
We think that
Alison killed her.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.988
How do you expect me
to find her?

16:18.170 --> 16:19.660
Little Bungee.

16:21.540 --> 16:24.373
Bungee?
That's his name.

16:24.410 --> 16:27.174
How did you know that?

16:33.820 --> 16:36.584
Kitchen's that way if you
want to look for your mom's

16:36.620 --> 16:37.723
whatever-it-was.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.749
Muffin tray.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.997
She swears
she left it here.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.391
Ali's not home.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.669
Yeah, I know.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.236
You two are never
In the same place

16:50.270 --> 16:51.362
at the same time
these days.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.708
That a trick question?

16:53.740 --> 16:56.038
No.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.604
No,
it's just a regular statement.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.345
What do you want, Spencer?

17:01.420 --> 17:03.047
I want to know
why you're protectIng her.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.808
The cops found traces
of Mona's DNA in Ali's trunk.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.816
But it's not enough
to arrest her,

17:09.860 --> 17:11.487
not when you're providing
her with an alibi.

17:12.830 --> 17:13.694
Your dad, I understand.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.722
You're the only one
who finds it hard to believe

17:17.770 --> 17:18.794
we were all together
that day.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.297
Jason,
I know that you--

17:20.340 --> 17:23.229
Em, you find
those muffins yet?

17:23.270 --> 17:25.033
Uh, no, not yet.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.503
At some point that day,

17:29.540 --> 17:32.100
she got in her car
and she left the house,

17:32.150 --> 17:35.074
and she didn't come back
for a long time.

17:35.120 --> 17:39.409
I know she's your sister,
but so am I.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.257
She set me up, Jason.

17:40.290 --> 17:43.259
I'm gonna go to jail
because of her.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.429
Somebody's dead
because of her.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.559
They're the ones
that are asking you to lie

17:50.600 --> 17:52.420
and all I want is the truth.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.161
Please.

17:59.470 --> 18:03.509
Gates and walls,

18:03.550 --> 18:08.146
dams and barriers.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.552
How can you live
in such a psychically

18:13.590 --> 18:15.285
constipated environment?

18:15.320 --> 18:17.686
I eat a lot of fiber.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.392
Secrets are one thing,

18:20.430 --> 18:23.422
but secrets that
carry over Into death,

18:23.470 --> 18:24.619
are very toxic.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.834
It makes it hard
to see clearly.

18:28.870 --> 18:34.331
I see, but as through
a glass darkly.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.279
Did Alison kill Mona?

18:46.550 --> 18:48.359
Each one hated the other...

18:49.390 --> 18:53.895
because each one
feared the other,

18:53.930 --> 18:55.454
because...

18:56.760 --> 19:00.196
each one knew something
about the other.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.332
Where's Mona?

19:15.620 --> 19:19.545
She isn't in Rosewood.
She's in the dark.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.928
She is not having
an easy passing.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.450
Betrayal.

19:25.490 --> 19:28.323
Betrayal and loss.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.364
Her soul is caught, bound.

19:33.470 --> 19:36.792
She is surrounded by earth

19:36.840 --> 19:39.502
and insects and cold.

19:41.740 --> 19:45.574
There is no peace,
only fear.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.741
Well, that was a bust.

19:51.790 --> 19:52.540
Spencen

19:52.590 --> 19:55.354
No, Em, just--
You should go, okay?

19:55.390 --> 19:56.709
Go, be with Paige,

19:56.760 --> 19:57.920
because at least one of us

19:57.960 --> 19:59.951
deserves a good
last day in Rosewood.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.724
What is that?

20:05.770 --> 20:07.499
I stole Ali's hairbrush.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.361
Why would you do that?

20:10.410 --> 20:13.436
Let's just say the cops
were to do another
sweep of Mona's house.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.630
Sure, All has an alibi,
but how strong can it be

20:15.680 --> 20:17.648
when Ali's DNA
is found at the crime scene?

20:17.680 --> 20:20.478
Emily, no.
First of all, you
can't just tell the cops

20:20.520 --> 20:21.475
to go back
and look again.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.475
And second of all,

20:22.520 --> 20:25.011
creating false evidence
is an actual crime.

20:25.050 --> 20:28.554
Spencer, you're being
charged with actual murder.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.924
( door opening and closing )

20:37.700 --> 20:39.725
Jason, what are
you doing here?

20:39.770 --> 20:42.762
I came by to pick up
some files for the office.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.860
They were up in that closet
with all Dad's family photos.

20:45.910 --> 20:48.777
You know you have
three full baby albums?

20:48.810 --> 20:49.879
Guess,
how many I've got.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.013
Remember this?

21:01.660 --> 21:03.628
It was a good day.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.458
No, it wasn't.

21:06.490 --> 21:07.991
Dad forgot his wallet.

21:08.030 --> 21:10.021
We were fighting
the whole time.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.618
It took eight shots

21:11.670 --> 21:13.729
before we finally got one
of us all smiling.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.031
I guess I remember
it differently.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.334
You always
had a knack for that.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.571
Remembering things
differently, you and Dad.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.646
I wish I had that.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.874
I really do.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.557
You had him wrapped around
your finger from day one.

21:34.590 --> 21:37.582
Spencer talked to you,
didn't she?

21:37.630 --> 21:41.919
Yeah, she did, and Emily.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.325
And they're right, Ali.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.965
You went somewhere
on Thanksgiving day.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.809
Then you came back
and barely said a word.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.607
Where did you go, Ali?

21:54.640 --> 21:56.471
Really.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.774
I'm being framed, Jason.

22:00.380 --> 22:03.383
Spencer, Emily,
Aria, Hanna...

22:03.420 --> 22:06.389
they're all working
together.

22:06.420 --> 22:09.514
They wish I'd never come back
and now they want me gone.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.824
You have to believe me.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.896
I did not kill Mona.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.537
( rock music blaring )

22:24.570 --> 22:26.709
Well, must be nice
to have your own place.

22:26.740 --> 22:29.470
It's my mom's name
on the lease.

22:29.510 --> 22:30.499
She's helping me out
for a while, so.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.608
Here.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.777
I didn't know
how you took it,

22:33.820 --> 22:35.913
but there's cream
and sugar In the bag.

22:35.950 --> 22:37.042
Thanks.

22:39.490 --> 22:40.582
What's all this?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.382
Decryption software.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.523
It's searching
for any existing patterns

22:45.560 --> 22:47.790
that may have been used
to encrypt Mona's data.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.862
We find the pattern,
we unlock the files.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.936
Sounds fancy.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.767
Yeah, well,
the problem is that

22:55.800 --> 22:57.859
Mona isn't using
any known patterns.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.639
She made them all up.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.807
I've been running
decryption software

23:00.840 --> 23:02.478
for months with no luck.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.774
So all this
hacking stuff,

23:04.810 --> 23:07.108
does it like
work on websites too?

23:07.150 --> 23:09.710
You trying out for anonymous
or something?

23:09.750 --> 23:11.809
No, of course not.

23:11.850 --> 23:15.889
Aria, your Sudoku prowess
doesn't exactly qualify you

23:15.920 --> 23:17.785
to help out
with this kind of stuff.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.956
You know that.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.128
So why are you here?

23:24.500 --> 23:28.061
Okay. Three months ago,
I applied to six colleges,

23:28.100 --> 23:29.636
and I didn't get into Brown.

23:29.670 --> 23:31.103
That's fine.

23:31.140 --> 23:34.769
It was kind of a stretch,
but Oberlin?

23:34.810 --> 23:36.630
I mean,
I nailed that interview.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.806
So you want me to break
into Oberlin's database

23:39.850 --> 23:41.613
and find out
why you got rejected?

23:41.650 --> 23:45.188
Yeah, I need to know
if it's me or if it's "A."

23:49.760 --> 23:51.955
All right.
Take a seat.

24:04.570 --> 24:08.074
What am I supposed
to do with all this?

24:08.110 --> 24:11.568
Give a man a ﬁsh,
he only eats for a day.

24:11.610 --> 24:14.170
All right, Caleb, look,
if you don't want to help...

24:16.850 --> 24:19.842
Okay, teach me.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.498
Do you know how long
Mona's mom is gonna be gone?

24:29.530 --> 24:31.589
I don't know.
We have to act fast.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.034
God, the last time
I was here...

24:39.110 --> 24:40.873
We were stepping
over Mona's blood.

24:42.310 --> 24:45.575
Okay.
So the police have
already searched,

24:45.610 --> 24:47.168
so we have to think of places
that they might have missed,

24:47.210 --> 24:51.783
or places that the hair
could have moved since then.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.242
Okay.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.689
Bingo.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.792
You guys tell Mona's mom

25:09.840 --> 25:11.262
that she's got cameras
in her molding.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.062
Why does it have to be me?

25:13.110 --> 25:14.509
Because she likes you.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.872
If you suggest the police
should take another look,
she'll listen.

25:16.910 --> 25:19.276
Just tell_her that Mona said
somethIng about cameras,

25:19.310 --> 25:20.709
and how she was scared.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.843
What makes you sure
it was Mona's camera?

25:22.880 --> 25:24.017
Because if her mother
knew it was there,

25:24.050 --> 25:25.312
she would have
told the police.

25:25.350 --> 25:26.783
Why can't you ask Toby?

25:26.820 --> 25:28.151
I mean, he's just
joined the police force.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.055
Do you want me
to tell him that I found it

25:30.090 --> 25:31.819
while I was trying
to plant evidence?

25:31.860 --> 25:33.088
You guys,
I have to take a step back

25:33.130 --> 25:34.927
from the Mona
of it all, I really do.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.292
Hanna, that blood we saw
inside Mona's front door,

25:37.330 --> 25:39.218
that camera was
p0Inted rIght at It.

25:39.270 --> 25:40.999
Okay, it must have seen
what happened.

25:46.070 --> 25:48.277
I've decided what to do.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.302
I'm going to set up a fund,

25:53.350 --> 25:55.318
to buy books
for the children's library.

25:55.350 --> 25:58.842
And inside each book
there will be a card

25:58.890 --> 26:01.051
with a picture of Mona,

26:01.090 --> 26:03.979
explaining that
the book is a gift from her.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.790
I think
that's a really nice idea.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.065
Mona loved to read.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.801
For a long time,
I think it was all she had.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.873
Hanna, do you
want to borrow that?

26:24.910 --> 26:26.002
I can't read this.

26:26.050 --> 26:27.039
You should.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.378
Henry James
understood girls.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.911
This is more of
a Spencer Hastings type book.

26:31.950 --> 26:34.054
You're smarter than
Spencer HastIngs.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.182
I am not.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.255
You are.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.928
You just pretend like
you aren't.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.689
It's another way to hide.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.027
Haven't I taught you
anything?

26:41.060 --> 26:43.824
You don't have to hide
from anyone anymore.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.259
Let other people hide
from you for a change.

26:48.700 --> 26:49.928
Hanna?

26:51.870 --> 26:53.337
Would you like
to keep that book?

26:54.740 --> 26:55.832
Thank you.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.672
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said,

26:59.710 --> 27:02.178
about Mona being afraid,

27:02.220 --> 27:03.778
and I remember her
teIIIng me

27:03.820 --> 27:06.846
that she wanted
to set up cameras

27:06.890 --> 27:08.084
to keep an eye on things.

27:10.060 --> 27:11.084
Cameras?

27:13.430 --> 27:15.853
Do you think that
she would have done
something like that?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.159
Hello?

27:29.840 --> 27:31.148
Mike?

27:34.880 --> 27:36.245
Ezra?

27:51.100 --> 27:53.068
( phone ringing )

27:55.240 --> 27:56.264
No.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.101
No! No!

28:05.080 --> 28:06.308
Don't do this to me.

28:06.350 --> 28:07.977
Please.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.114
Alison! Ali.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.118
Ali. Ali.

28:15.890 --> 28:16.959
Stop!

28:33.370 --> 28:34.803
( car horn honking )

28:37.010 --> 28:38.409
Hello, Alison.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.113
Hello, Mrs. Grunwald.

28:41.150 --> 28:44.085
I was visiting
someone in town.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.839
How fortunate to_ run
Into you lIke thIs.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.912
It's pretty amazing.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.178
I'm not going to ask you
how you are.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.754
When people say that,

28:53.800 --> 28:56.519
they really don't want
an honest answer, do they?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.790
They just ask
so you'll say "fine,"

28:58.830 --> 29:00.195
and they don't have
to deal with you anymore.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.869
Precisely.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.208
If people meeting casually

29:04.240 --> 29:07.038
told each other
how they really felt,

29:07.070 --> 29:10.130
the streets would be
awash with tears.

29:10.180 --> 29:13.877
However,
I am sorry for your loss.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.279
I have to be somewhere,
Mrs. Grunwald.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.208
As do we all.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.387
Nice to see you.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.853
Same here.

29:33.970 --> 29:37.906
You are in my thoughts
and prayers, Alison.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.136
Thank you.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.149
TANNER: Mrs. Vanderwaal
asked us to search
the house again,

29:52.190 --> 29:53.441
and we found this.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.549
There were three cameras.

29:56.590 --> 29:58.854
This is the only
relevant one.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.858
Mona put them in herself.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.027
The batteries
ran down months ago,

30:03.060 --> 30:05.392
but they were working
on Thanksgiving.

30:10.470 --> 30:12.233
Is there anything
about the attacker

30:12.270 --> 30:14.477
that in any way
is familiar to you?

30:16.080 --> 30:19.538
Do you recognize anything
about that person?

30:27.190 --> 30:28.282
It could be my sister.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.457
It could be Alison.

30:33.260 --> 30:36.127
How could it be your sister
if Alison was with you

30:36.160 --> 30:38.594
and your father
when the incident occurred?

30:42.640 --> 30:45.200
Because
she wasn't WIth us.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.162
That was a lie.

30:47.210 --> 30:51.044
You're saying that Alison
wasn't with you

30:51.080 --> 30:53.071
when Mona _Vanderwaal
was kIlled?

30:53.110 --> 30:55.146
That's right.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.341
Thank you,
Mr. DiLaurentis.

31:01.090 --> 31:02.387
Does Ezra know
what happened?

31:02.420 --> 31:05.981
No, and I'm going
to keep it that way.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.055
Are you sure it was All
who attacked you
and took the computer?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.226
Who else could it be?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.198
That's not what I asked.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.137
Yes, I'm sure.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.899
( cell phone ringing )

31:18.340 --> 31:20.467
What is it?
It's Paige.

31:20.510 --> 31:23.172
I wanted to take her
to the airport,
but she has to leave now.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.575
Oh, maybe
that's what you should do.

31:24.610 --> 31:28.376
No, we have to do
this together.

31:43.330 --> 31:45.093
( police siren blares )

31:50.070 --> 31:52.300
Can you at least
try to stall them?

31:52.340 --> 31:55.002
( police siren blaring )

32:04.220 --> 32:05.312
Get out of my way.

32:05.350 --> 32:06.385
Now!

32:11.330 --> 32:13.286
You killed Mona, Ali.

32:13.330 --> 32:14.319
We're not letting you
get away.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.554
"A" set me up.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.728
You're letting "A" win.
Shut up, Ali.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.193
Who's going to protect you
when I'm gone?

32:21.240 --> 32:24.266
If you do this,
you'll all be next.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.709
Move!

32:25.740 --> 32:27.264
Now!

32:27.310 --> 32:28.334
Hands above your head.

32:35.450 --> 32:37.418
Ladies, move.

32:40.150 --> 32:42.254
Turn around slowly.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.022
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

32:50.330 --> 32:53.060
Alison DiLaurentis,
you are under arrest

32:53.100 --> 32:55.261
for the murder
of Mona Vanderwaal.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.393
Turn around.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.431
( handcuffs clicking )

33:10.780 --> 33:12.008
Hey.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.117
Hey.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.479
You found my phone.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.256
Yeah.

33:19.390 --> 33:20.459
Can I talk to you
for a second?

33:22.260 --> 33:23.352
I'm starving.
Can we do this later?

33:23.400 --> 33:24.389
Alison's been arrested...

33:26.700 --> 33:28.292
for Mona's murder.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.465
Okay.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.434
Okay?
That's your response?

33:38.250 --> 33:40.445
Just sit down, please.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.525
Here's the thing.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.421
I'm afraid to know
what you know.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.830
Mona knew
a lot of things,

34:05.870 --> 34:09.670
about me,
a lot of things
about my friends.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.270
You know, this time
I thought that it was you

34:14.320 --> 34:15.776
that was afraid to talk to me,
but really I...

34:18.390 --> 34:20.381
I think that it was me
who was afraid to talk to you.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.784
But if Ali's behind bars...

34:27.130 --> 34:30.327
maybe that means
that we don't have
to be afraid anymore.

34:33.630 --> 34:34.631
I know you hated Mona.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.061
Maybe for good reason,
maybe not.

34:42.310 --> 34:43.709
But now you're just like
the rest of them...

34:45.550 --> 34:47.768
pretending she was a saint
when you didn't even know her.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.485
You know what that's like,

34:51.520 --> 34:53.442
listening to a bunch
of people memorialize

34:53.490 --> 34:54.650
someone they don't
even know?

34:58.890 --> 35:01.427
You think if people said
how great she was to her face,

35:01.460 --> 35:02.654
none of this
would've ever happened?

35:05.800 --> 35:07.597
I'm sick of being told

35:07.630 --> 35:11.430
how sweet and smart
and nIce she was.

35:13.540 --> 35:14.837
She wasn't nice.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.841
Anyone can be nice.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.645
There will _never be
anyone lIke her.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.218
But do you think
that maybe sometime

35:35.260 --> 35:36.591
you could
tell me about her?

35:38.330 --> 35:39.319
The Mona you knew?

35:40.930 --> 35:43.467
The real Mona.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.774
Okay.

35:52.810 --> 35:55.643
I'm gonna see if
Dad needs help with dinner.

36:06.530 --> 36:08.851
( Mike sobbing )

36:22.310 --> 36:23.777
WOMAN: ( on PA) This is
a free boarding announcement

36:23.810 --> 36:25.971
for flight 89 B, Rome.

36:26.010 --> 36:29.514
We are now inviting passengers
with small children

36:29.550 --> 36:31.609
and any passengers
requiring special assistance

36:31.650 --> 36:33.538
to begin boarding
at this time.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.615
Please have your boarding pass
and identification ready.

36:35.660 --> 36:39.323
Regular boarding
will begin in approximately...

36:42.830 --> 36:45.594
Oh, God, you're here.

36:45.630 --> 36:46.961
You changed your mind.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.663
The airline changed my gate.
My flight's boarding now.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.228
How did you get
past security?

36:56.840 --> 36:58.649
I bought a $69 ticket
to Atlantic City.

36:59.710 --> 37:00.847
Paige, you don't
have to go.

37:02.450 --> 37:04.987
They arrested Alison
for killing Mona.
She's in jail.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.018
She won't stay there.
Yes, she will.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.483
Tell your parents,
they have to let you stay.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.851
It's safe now.
Emily, I have to go.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.368
Listen to me, you don't.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.618
Yes, I do.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.797
I've thought about this
for months, and I do.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.398
Why?

37:25.940 --> 37:27.669
First, because my parents
want me to.

37:27.710 --> 37:28.734
Okay. Well, we
can fight that.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.804
I don't want
to fight anymore.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.542
I'm tired of fighting.

37:34.580 --> 37:37.947
I've used so much energy
fighting and being afraid,

37:37.980 --> 37:39.538
I'm worried
I'm not gonna have

37:39.590 --> 37:40.716
anything left
to just live.

37:43.660 --> 37:44.752
You know what I mean.

37:48.630 --> 37:51.793
Yeah.
I guess I do.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.364
So maybe this isn't
such a bad idea.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.367
You know,
it's a terrible idea.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.570
What if we decide to pretend
it's a good idea?

38:03.610 --> 38:05.305
MAN: (on PA) This is
the final boarding announcement

38:05.350 --> 38:07.477
for flight 214
to San Francisco.

38:07.510 --> 38:08.647
A|| ticketed passengers,

38:08.680 --> 38:09.749
please make
your way to the gate.

38:13.450 --> 38:15.452
Please don't go.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.557
I have to.

38:18.590 --> 38:19.955
Okay, well,
take another flight.

38:19.990 --> 38:22.788
It's not going to be
any easier tomorrow.

38:27.630 --> 38:28.790
This isn't fair.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.337
Maybe not,
but right now,

38:35.380 --> 38:36.870
this is what's supposed
to happen to us.

38:43.720 --> 38:47.941
* You will try to love someone
without getting a word in *

38:47.990 --> 38:50.117
* That's right

38:50.160 --> 38:55.757
* If only I'd known
how this was gonna play *

38:55.800 --> 38:58.689
* If you're happier this way

39:01.740 --> 39:06.109
* Oh, if you're happier
this way *

39:07.670 --> 39:11.845
* I'll let you have
the final say *

39:25.090 --> 39:26.079
Spencen

39:36.870 --> 39:40.431
I wanted to tell you
this in person.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.438
We have been reviewing
all of the evidence,

39:42.480 --> 39:44.778
and we now believe
that Mona Vanderwaal

39:44.810 --> 39:46.675
was_ not _A|i_son's
fIrst VIctIm.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.646
Bethany Young?

39:53.750 --> 39:55.718
The DA is dropping
the charges against you.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.012
The police think
Alison set you up.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.522
Oh, my God.
It's over, Spencer.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.692
It's all over.

40:15.110 --> 40:16.509
For a minute,
Ithought

40:16.540 --> 40:18.770
I'd just get on the plane
to Atlantic City

40:18.810 --> 40:22.769
and fly away,
but I didn't.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.516
I've been to Atlantic City,
you made the right choice.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.779
You know, Paige was wrong.

40:28.820 --> 40:29.889
She should have stayed.

40:32.190 --> 40:35.648
I don't think
she was wrong.
She got out.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.932
We should all think
about getting out of here.

40:46.970 --> 40:49.177
To Atlantic City?

40:49.210 --> 40:50.700
I just said that--

40:50.740 --> 40:52.549
No, no, not to Atlantic City,
to anywhere.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.972
I mean, Ali's in jail,

40:55.020 --> 40:56.715
nobody thinks
I killed anybody.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.481
Nothing's keeping us
here anymore.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.614
After we graduate, we can go
wherever we want to.

41:02.660 --> 41:06.027
A|i kept us in this town
like we were magnetized.

41:07.790 --> 41:08.950
That's over.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.797
The spell is broken.

41:10.830 --> 41:12.798
We've all got
college applications out.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.929
So it's not too late.

41:15.970 --> 41:17.892
If we can achieve
escape veIOCIty,

41:17.940 --> 41:20.238
we can have a chance
at our own actual lIves.

41:20.270 --> 41:23.933
No gates, no dams,
no barriers.

41:23.980 --> 41:25.675
An actual life.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.785
Is that the carnival
at St. Bridgette's?

41:36.820 --> 41:38.014
It's so beautiful.

41:47.330 --> 41:51.164
No, no,
I don't accept this.

41:52.570 --> 41:55.175
Alison is "A"
and Alison is in jail.

41:55.210 --> 41:58.099
Oh, my God.
They don't allow
fireworks in prison.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.846
No, no,
this has to be something

41:59.880 --> 42:01.768
that she set up
before they got her, right?

42:01.820 --> 42:02.878
That's what it
has to be.

42:32.780 --> 42:35.772
( indistinct chatter )

42:45.790 --> 42:47.929
( footsteps approaching )
