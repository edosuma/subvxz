WEBVTT

00:03.229 --> 00:05.148
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.315 --> 00:07.483
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.650 --> 00:10.069
<i>or breathed real air,
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.404 --> 00:12.697
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:12.864 --> 00:15.158
<i>For three generations,
the Ark has kept what's left</i>

00:15.241 --> 00:19.370
<i>of the human race alive,
but now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.454 --> 00:21.789
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.540 --> 00:25.793
<i>One hundred prisoners sent on
a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:26.210 --> 00:28.379
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.546 --> 00:30.840
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:31.007 --> 00:32.467
<i>All we have to do is survive.</i>

00:32.634 --> 00:35.428
<i>But we will be tested,
by the Earth,</i>

00:35.595 --> 00:39.390
<i>by the secrets it hides,
and most of all, by each other.</i>

00:40.975 --> 00:41.976
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:42.143 --> 00:43.686
These children need more time.

00:43.853 --> 00:46.773
We don't have time.
Engineering needs six months

00:46.939 --> 00:50.818
to fix life support,
and we'll be out of oxygen in four.

00:50.985 --> 00:52.987
No matter what happens,
you launch that pod.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.865
The second you find those kids,
you radio back.

00:56.032 --> 00:58.242
Three hundred innocent people
will die if you don't.

01:07.585 --> 01:10.046
Sir, a pod launched.

01:21.224 --> 01:22.600
Hey.

01:23.101 --> 01:24.477
Hi.

01:27.772 --> 01:30.191
It's almost dawn.
We should probably get going.

01:30.775 --> 01:33.611
Can't just lie around in bed all day.

01:33.945 --> 01:37.615
Or we could just lie around
in bed all day.

01:44.622 --> 01:48.793
Finn, you know that last night

01:48.960 --> 01:52.880
wasn't just about needing someone.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.301
I needed you.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.555
I wanted it to be you.

02:01.973 --> 02:03.558
You understand that, right?

02:04.350 --> 02:05.685
Sure.

02:08.145 --> 02:11.190
And I should probably tell you that

02:11.357 --> 02:15.695
last night, for me,
wasn't really about you.

02:18.990 --> 02:22.452
I just wanted to have my first
Earth sex.

02:24.912 --> 02:29.333
You were around.
Passably cute.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.085
Jackass.

02:44.599 --> 02:47.226
Prisoner.
Step to the rear of the cell.

02:48.478 --> 02:49.854
Have we heard from Raven?

02:50.813 --> 02:52.133
You can leave us alone, Sergeant.

02:52.231 --> 02:53.524
Sir.

02:54.358 --> 02:56.027
Has Raven started her descent?

02:58.696 --> 03:00.490
Environmental numbers?
- As of this morning.

03:00.656 --> 03:02.533
Oxygen is down 16 percent.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.869
CO2 and methane are heading
to red levels.

03:05.036 --> 03:06.889
Our projections said that
we wouldn't be critical

03:06.913 --> 03:08.206
for another three months.

03:08.372 --> 03:10.124
Your husband's projections
were wrong.

03:10.541 --> 03:13.836
The council has granted you
work release pending review.

03:14.003 --> 03:15.171
Medical is overwhelmed.

03:15.338 --> 03:17.715
Dizziness, fatigue, vision problems.

03:18.007 --> 03:20.218
It's pulmonary toxicity.

03:20.384 --> 03:22.261
I know how they feel.

03:22.428 --> 03:26.557
The prison section has been
on half-air since midnight.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.728
No.

03:30.895 --> 03:32.522
I'm not gonna take more
than my share.

03:32.688 --> 03:35.566
We start choosing
who gets extra O2,

03:35.733 --> 03:39.070
and we're one step closer
to choosing who lives and who dies.

03:39.237 --> 03:43.115
Abby, the council approved Kane's

03:43.282 --> 03:45.993
population reduction plan
three hours ago.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.245
You voted without me.

03:47.411 --> 03:49.163
We followed the rules of order.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.665
It wouldn't have mattered.

03:50.832 --> 03:53.167
Their approval was unanimous.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.919
We start in 12 hours.

03:59.090 --> 04:00.091
How many?

04:00.258 --> 04:02.528
Three hundred and twenty people
will be excised from the grid.

04:02.552 --> 04:04.011
No, murdered, Thelonious.

04:04.095 --> 04:05.781
Three hundred and twenty people
will be murdered.

04:05.805 --> 04:08.182
We need to wait for Raven
to report back.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.728
Look at those numbers.

04:12.895 --> 04:15.356
Every hour that passes,
we put more people in danger.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.315
She risked her life for those people.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.777
No, you risked her life.

04:19.944 --> 04:21.547
When you let her believe
that loving a boy

04:21.571 --> 04:24.907
somehow meant trusting her life
in a 100-year-old metal coffin.

04:26.117 --> 04:28.619
And that trust is going to kill her.

04:28.786 --> 04:32.498
Another child dead,
just like all the others,

04:32.665 --> 04:33.833
just like our own.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.173
Take this. People are suffering.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.092
You can help.

04:48.306 --> 04:50.433
Raven will make it to Earth.
I know she will.

04:50.975 --> 04:52.435
Godspeed to her.

05:10.036 --> 05:14.373
Ok. RCS valve... open.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.711
RCS thrust pressure good.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.549
Altitude... good.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.802
Heat shield... good.

05:28.554 --> 05:29.931
Okay.

05:34.685 --> 05:36.312
Don't let me blow up.

06:03.047 --> 06:04.298
It's so quiet.

06:08.719 --> 06:10.388
Where'd you get that shirt?

06:11.430 --> 06:15.977
Well, there were more than just
art supplies in the bunker, Finn.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.314
We should share.

06:23.693 --> 06:25.277
If we brought the stuff back...

06:26.445 --> 06:28.739
...then they'd know that
we found someplace

06:28.906 --> 06:30.146
and where would we go next time

06:30.241 --> 06:32.243
someone pulls a "Murphy"
and goes ballistic?

06:34.412 --> 06:35.788
Yeah.

06:46.007 --> 06:47.591
I wanted it to be you, too.

07:12.408 --> 07:14.285
Finn. Look.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.915
A shooting star.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.418
You should make a wish.

07:23.586 --> 07:24.628
Why?

07:24.795 --> 07:26.839
It's a thing people used
to do a long time ago.

07:27.798 --> 07:28.883
I read about it.

07:29.050 --> 07:31.135
But it's just a rock
burning up in the atmosphere.

07:31.594 --> 07:35.306
Why would that make
your wish come true?

07:37.641 --> 07:40.144
All right, romance killer.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.820
Finn, that's not a shooting star.

07:53.032 --> 07:54.450
<i>Check it out.</i>

07:54.825 --> 07:56.368
<i>Bellamy! Get out here!</i>

08:00.164 --> 08:01.415
There!

08:01.832 --> 08:03.209
They're coming to help us.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.503
Now we can kick some Grounder ass.

08:05.669 --> 08:06.670
Yeah!

08:06.837 --> 08:09.090
Please tell me they
brought down some shampoo.

08:13.844 --> 08:18.182
We should stop at camp.
Get some gear. Weapons.

08:18.349 --> 08:19.725
They send some down?

08:19.892 --> 08:22.228
It's too small to be a dropship.
I'm thinking cargo pod.

08:22.394 --> 08:25.356
No. They wouldn't arm
a bunch of juvenile delinquents.

08:25.523 --> 08:28.442
It's probably nutrition packs,
medical supplies.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.944
There'd be a radio.

08:30.903 --> 08:32.029
We can talk to the Ark.

08:32.196 --> 08:34.280
That is if the radio
wasn't fried in the landing.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.243
We're not alone down here anymore.
That's a good thing.

08:37.409 --> 08:41.996
Yeah, not for Wells
or Charlotte or Atom.

08:42.164 --> 08:43.957
Nobody thought any of us
would survive.

08:44.542 --> 08:45.876
But we did.

08:46.377 --> 08:48.379
You should take a minute
to appreciate that.

08:51.549 --> 08:53.300
Okay. Minute's done.

08:57.096 --> 08:59.176
If it cleared the ridge,
it's probably near the lake.

09:00.141 --> 09:01.851
We should get moving.
Everyone's ready.

09:02.101 --> 09:03.561
No one's going anywhere.

09:03.727 --> 09:05.521
Not while it's dark.
It isn't safe.

09:06.564 --> 09:08.482
We'll head out at first light.
Pass the word.

09:12.570 --> 09:15.239
Everyone for 100 miles
saw this thing come down.

09:15.406 --> 09:17.074
What if the Grounders
get to it first?

09:17.908 --> 09:19.201
Bell, we should go now.

09:19.368 --> 09:21.287
I said we wait until sunrise.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.837
Blue triangle.

09:30.963 --> 09:34.258
Orange square. Yellow triangle.

09:36.093 --> 09:39.054
Green circle. A little smushed.

09:39.430 --> 09:40.639
It's an oval.

09:40.806 --> 09:44.018
Thanks, Dad. I forget,
whose eyes are they testing?

09:44.768 --> 09:47.563
Okay, Reese.
Now the other eye.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.774
Nothing. It's just black.

09:52.359 --> 09:56.655
Okay. Let me know if you see
anything at all.

09:58.574 --> 10:00.034
Are you doing it?

10:01.285 --> 10:02.620
We're finished.

10:02.953 --> 10:04.997
Why don't you wait outside
while I talk to your dad?

10:05.456 --> 10:06.790
Wait with Miss Lucy.

10:07.458 --> 10:08.709
Hey, wait.

10:09.126 --> 10:10.127
It's fine.

10:10.294 --> 10:12.397
Let me get this out of your eyes.
I don't know how you can see.

10:12.421 --> 10:14.965
I can't see.
That's why we're here. Duh.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.029
Don't worry, the rolling of the eyes

10:19.053 --> 10:20.721
and the attitude
doesn't last for long.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.306
Ten, fifteen years, maybe.

10:22.473 --> 10:24.391
It's just an act. She's scared.

10:25.476 --> 10:26.644
It's not getting any better.

10:26.810 --> 10:29.146
The decline has been accelerating
for the past few days.

10:29.313 --> 10:30.648
The air's never been this bad.

10:30.814 --> 10:32.983
They're gonna fix it, right?
Like always?

10:34.318 --> 10:35.653
I hope so.

10:38.155 --> 10:40.824
Hey. She's a nine-year-old girl.

10:41.450 --> 10:43.720
What's she gonna do with the rest
of her life blind in this place?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.371
She's strong.

10:45.537 --> 10:46.747
She shouldn't have to be.

10:52.169 --> 10:54.129
Hey. You all right?

10:54.296 --> 10:56.257
I just saw a little girl
with optic nerve damage

10:56.423 --> 10:59.426
because of chronic oxygen deficiency.

11:00.010 --> 11:02.513
She's going blind
and I can't do anything about it,

11:02.680 --> 11:04.974
so, no, nothing about
any of this is right.

11:06.058 --> 11:07.726
You're doing what you can.

11:07.893 --> 11:10.688
Why aren't you monitoring the radio?

11:10.854 --> 11:11.897
Listening for Raven?

11:12.064 --> 11:13.899
Have you looked outside?
We're slammed.

11:14.858 --> 11:16.652
It's still transmitting
the automatic hail.

11:16.819 --> 11:19.446
I'll take care of medical
and you listen to that radio.

11:20.030 --> 11:21.230
Making contact with the ground

11:21.365 --> 11:23.409
is the only way we can
really help these people.

11:27.621 --> 11:31.208
<i>Pod one, pod one,
this is Ark Station Medical.</i>

11:31.375 --> 11:33.711
<i>If you are receiving, please respond.</i>

11:33.877 --> 11:37.381
<i>Pod one, pod one,
this is Ark Station Medical.</i>

11:37.548 --> 11:40.009
<i>If you are receiving, please respond.</i>

11:40.175 --> 11:43.554
<i>Pod one, pod one,
this is Ark Station Medical.</i>

11:43.721 --> 11:44.763
<i>If you are receiving...</i>

11:49.018 --> 11:50.561
Looks like everybody's up.

11:54.565 --> 11:55.816
Did you guys see that?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.711
You know it's from the Ark, right?
It had to be.

11:57.735 --> 11:59.236
Grab your stuff.
Let's find out.

11:59.403 --> 12:01.047
Bellamy said we're
gonna wait until sunrise.

12:01.071 --> 12:02.656
Where is he?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.495
Ever hear of knocking, bitch?

12:08.662 --> 12:11.016
Oh, great, it's a free show.
Anyone else want to take a look?

12:11.040 --> 12:12.416
Where the hell is Bellamy?

12:12.583 --> 12:13.625
He took off a while ago.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.044
Gear's gone.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.503
He told everyone to stay.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.380
Whatever's in that thing,
he wants it.

12:18.547 --> 12:20.174
We've gotta get there before he does.

12:21.759 --> 12:23.135
You're welcome.

12:25.262 --> 12:26.764
This isn't your fault, Clarke.

12:26.930 --> 12:29.016
I should've known
he'd go for that radio.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.952
How are you supposed to know
something like that?

12:30.976 --> 12:33.079
Because he's spent every
single minute since we landed

12:33.103 --> 12:36.231
making sure no one on the Ark
finds out we're alive.

12:37.149 --> 12:39.252
It doesn't mean you can predict
what people are gonna do.

12:39.276 --> 12:42.112
That's exactly what I have to do.
I screwed up.

12:42.279 --> 12:44.281
Let myself get distracted.

12:49.119 --> 12:50.371
Bellamy!

12:51.288 --> 12:52.289
What are you doing?

12:52.456 --> 12:53.957
Go back to camp.
It isn't safe.

12:54.124 --> 12:57.002
You lied to everyone.
You lied to me.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.605
You just want whatever's
in that pod...

12:58.629 --> 13:00.047
Just go home!

13:00.214 --> 13:02.508
You always want to play
the big brother, huh?

13:02.674 --> 13:04.760
Well, guess what?
Joke's on me.

13:04.927 --> 13:06.637
You're just a selfish dick.

13:06.804 --> 13:10.974
I did this for you,
to protect you.

13:11.141 --> 13:13.977
If the Ark finds out we're alive,
they'll come down.

13:14.144 --> 13:17.898
And when they do, I'm dead.

13:18.524 --> 13:19.900
What did you do?

13:20.609 --> 13:21.985
I shot him.

13:23.612 --> 13:24.780
I shot Jaha.

13:24.947 --> 13:26.115
What?

13:26.657 --> 13:28.826
I found out they were sending
you to Earth.

13:28.992 --> 13:30.661
I couldn't let you go alone.

13:32.162 --> 13:35.541
Someone came to me with a deal,
do this.

13:35.707 --> 13:38.335
Kill him, and they'd get me
on the dropship.

13:40.629 --> 13:41.964
And I did it.

13:42.339 --> 13:43.715
You killed the chancellor?

13:43.882 --> 13:46.009
He floated our mother.

13:46.176 --> 13:47.511
He locked you up.

13:48.429 --> 13:49.555
He deserved it.

13:49.721 --> 13:51.265
I didn't ask you to do that.

13:54.017 --> 13:55.394
You're right.

13:56.186 --> 13:58.939
I made the choice.
This is on me.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.692
Whatever they sent down,
I'll take care of it.

14:03.819 --> 14:05.446
I didn't ask for any of this.

14:13.912 --> 14:17.249
At 1930 hours,
all hatches and vents

14:17.416 --> 14:20.377
leading to Section 17
will be sealed.

14:22.379 --> 14:25.716
It will appear to be a malfunction
of the fire containment system.

14:26.216 --> 14:27.718
So, it'll look like an accident.

14:27.885 --> 14:30.679
It's essential to maintaining
public order

14:30.846 --> 14:32.973
after the culling takes place.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.101
All residents of Section 17
will be in their sleep period.

14:36.268 --> 14:38.312
The council has already
issued a writ of consent

14:38.479 --> 14:40.898
giving the chancellor
permission to carry out

14:41.064 --> 14:43.108
the population reduction.

14:43.275 --> 14:47.237
A sleep-inducing gas will be
introduced into the air.

14:47.404 --> 14:52.117
On your command, the oxygen supply
to Section 17 will be cut off.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.786
It should be painless.

14:54.953 --> 14:56.705
Document needs your approval.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.048
You have it, with one alteration.

15:08.258 --> 15:10.260
You'll give the order
to cut off the oxygen.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.015
I don't have the authority.

15:15.182 --> 15:18.060
In your capacity as chancellor.

15:18.227 --> 15:24.191
Tonight, I will be in Section 17
inspecting repairs to the hull,

15:24.358 --> 15:27.694
and when those doors are
closed on those people,

15:27.861 --> 15:30.739
their fate will be my fate.

15:30.906 --> 15:31.907
Your fate.

15:36.537 --> 15:37.704
Don't do this.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.498
My mind is made up.

15:39.665 --> 15:43.043
I'm leaving you
in terrible times, Marcus,

15:43.210 --> 15:48.799
but you, you have a strength
that is not weakened by sentiment.

15:51.134 --> 15:54.471
And that's exactly what it's going
to take for us to survive.

16:00.561 --> 16:03.939
<i>Pod one, pod one,
this is Ark Station Medical.</i>

16:04.106 --> 16:06.650
<i>If you are receiving, please respond.</i>

16:06.817 --> 16:10.404
<i>Pod one, pod one,
this is Ark Station Medical.</i>

16:10.571 --> 16:12.573
<i>If you are receiving, please respond.</i>

16:12.739 --> 16:16.326
<i>Pod one, pod one,
this is Ark Station Medical.</i>

16:16.493 --> 16:18.704
<i>If you are receiving, please respond.</i>

16:40.851 --> 16:42.269
Should we split up?

16:42.436 --> 16:45.355
- Yeah. You go that way.
- Okay.

16:45.522 --> 16:47.024
- I'll check the bottom.
- Okay.

17:10.422 --> 17:12.257
Ahh.

17:14.009 --> 17:16.678
Crap. That's not good.

17:20.682 --> 17:22.142
Oh, my God.

17:22.392 --> 17:23.769
Hi.

17:25.436 --> 17:26.480
I made it?

17:36.239 --> 17:37.783
Ahh.

17:37.908 --> 17:40.202
I dreamed it would smell like this.

17:42.579 --> 17:44.164
Is this rain?

17:46.083 --> 17:47.334
Welcome home.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.801
Raven!

17:57.803 --> 17:59.221
Finn!

18:07.771 --> 18:09.439
I knew you couldn't be dead.

18:12.442 --> 18:13.443
You're bleeding.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.112
I don't care.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.675
How did you get here?

18:37.342 --> 18:40.137
You know that big scrap hold,
the one on K deck?

18:41.471 --> 18:42.973
You built that from scrap?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.307
I kind of rebuilt it.

18:45.809 --> 18:47.310
Please. Like that's hard.

18:47.436 --> 18:49.563
It just needed a couple parts
and some love.

18:50.731 --> 18:51.982
You're insane.

18:52.149 --> 18:54.484
I'd do more for you and worse.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.611
Just like you would for me.

19:01.950 --> 19:04.578
Come on, sit down.
Sit down here.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.002
Let me get something for that.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.132
I'm sorry.

19:17.299 --> 19:18.467
Let's not talk about this.

19:18.633 --> 19:20.069
We've known each other
our whole lives.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.237
We don't need to talk about it.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.804
She needs to put pressure
on the wound.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.973
Thanks.

19:25.515 --> 19:27.476
This is Clarke.
She was on the dropship, too.

19:28.518 --> 19:29.853
Clarke?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.106
This was all because of your mom.

19:33.523 --> 19:36.359
- My mom?
- This was all her plan.

19:36.526 --> 19:38.278
We were trying to
come down here together.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.031
If we waited...
Oh, my God.

19:41.198 --> 19:43.158
We couldn't wait because
the council was voting

19:43.325 --> 19:46.119
whether to kill 300 people
to save air.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.497
- When?
- Today.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.165
We have to tell them you're alive.

19:54.085 --> 19:55.629
The radio's gone.

19:57.881 --> 19:59.800
It must've gotten loose
during reentry.

20:00.050 --> 20:02.219
I should've strapped it
to the A-strut. Stupid!

20:02.385 --> 20:05.680
No, no, this is my fault.
Someone got here before us.

20:05.847 --> 20:07.349
We have to find him.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.991
Tell me it's not true.

20:25.158 --> 20:29.579
Today there are so many things
that I wish weren't true.

20:29.746 --> 20:31.414
Spare me the noble speech.

20:31.581 --> 20:35.335
You know what I'm talking about.
You joining Section 17.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.546
How could I ask anyone
to make a sacrifice

20:37.712 --> 20:39.798
that I'm not willing to make myself?

20:40.715 --> 20:43.677
So, you're gonna die peacefully and
leave humanity in the hands of Kane?

20:43.844 --> 20:45.470
Chancellor Kane?

20:45.637 --> 20:48.181
Yes. He won't hesitate
to do what needs to be done.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.560
Thelonious,
this is all happening too fast.

20:51.726 --> 20:53.144
We've waited as long as possible.

20:53.311 --> 20:55.522
There are things that
we can do to buy us time.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.149
We should reconsider
forcing an algae bloom

20:58.316 --> 20:59.609
to boost oxygen production.

20:59.776 --> 21:02.505
You've read the studies. That would
only contaminate the water supply.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.866
We can induce people into comas
to reduce their resource consumption.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.742
We've gone through
all the possibilities.

21:07.909 --> 21:09.536
This is the only solution.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.204
No, it can't be this.

21:16.126 --> 21:18.336
I am doing what is right.

21:18.503 --> 21:20.297
You're running away.

21:20.463 --> 21:23.967
You think what you're doing is right,
but you're a coward.

21:30.765 --> 21:32.434
How are you gonna
explain it to Wells?

21:32.601 --> 21:36.021
How would you tell your son
that you let these people die

21:36.187 --> 21:40.233
without doing absolutely everything
in your power to save them?

22:18.480 --> 22:22.317
<i>People of the Ark.
My name is Jake Griffin.</i>

22:22.609 --> 22:26.446
<i>I'm senior environmental engineer
and deputy resource officer.</i>

22:26.988 --> 22:29.491
<i>Today, I need to talk
to you about our future.</i>

23:14.953 --> 23:16.329
Hey!

23:19.249 --> 23:20.291
Where is it?

23:20.458 --> 23:22.794
Hey, princess.
You taking a walk in the woods?

23:22.961 --> 23:27.424
They're getting ready to kill
300 people up there to save oxygen.

23:27.590 --> 23:29.968
And I can guarantee you
it won't be council members.

23:30.135 --> 23:32.262
It'll be working people.
Your people.

23:32.429 --> 23:34.347
Bellamy.
Where's the radio?

23:34.514 --> 23:36.114
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

23:36.141 --> 23:38.727
Bellamy Blake?
They're looking everywhere for you.

23:38.893 --> 23:40.270
Shut up.

23:40.437 --> 23:41.688
Looking for him why?

23:41.855 --> 23:43.398
He shot Chancellor Jaha.

23:45.275 --> 23:47.110
That's why you took the wristbands.

23:47.277 --> 23:49.029
Needed everyone to think we're dead.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.072
And all that
"whatever the hell we want"?

23:51.281 --> 23:53.116
You just care about saving
your own skin.

23:54.117 --> 23:56.661
Hey! Shooter!
Where's my radio?

23:56.828 --> 23:58.580
- Get out of my way.
- Where is it?

23:58.747 --> 24:00.582
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

24:00.790 --> 24:04.419
Really?
Well, I'm right here.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.506
Where's my radio?

24:08.673 --> 24:10.175
Okay, stop it.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.514
Jaha deserved to die.
You all know that.

24:16.681 --> 24:19.434
Yeah, he's not my
favorite person either.

24:19.601 --> 24:21.102
But he isn't dead.

24:22.937 --> 24:24.147
What?

24:24.814 --> 24:26.399
You're a lousy shot.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.944
Bellamy, don't you see
what this means?

24:30.111 --> 24:31.237
You're not a murderer.

24:32.322 --> 24:34.467
You always did what you had to do
to protect your sister.

24:34.491 --> 24:35.950
That's who you are.

24:36.618 --> 24:40.455
And you can do it again,
by protecting 300 of your people.

24:41.998 --> 24:43.625
Where's the radio?

24:44.834 --> 24:46.127
It's too late.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.009
<i>People of the Ark,</i>

24:53.176 --> 24:55.762
<i>today I need to talk
to you about our future.</i>

24:57.639 --> 25:00.266
<i>The things I need to tell you
are serious.</i>

25:00.683 --> 25:02.936
Sir, have you been on the network?

25:03.103 --> 25:04.312
No.

25:05.271 --> 25:11.361
<i>The Ark is dying. This city in space
that has been our sanctuary...</i>

25:11.528 --> 25:13.672
It's playing everywhere.
Tech's trying to shut it down.

25:13.696 --> 25:15.532
We should never have
let her out of the cell.

25:15.865 --> 25:18.493
<i>Time is running out.</i>

25:19.536 --> 25:25.416
<i>This is an undeniable reality,
but we have pledged our lives</i>

25:25.583 --> 25:28.878
<i>to make sure that humanity
does not share that fate.</i>

25:30.213 --> 25:33.842
<i>Now, while there is still time,</i>

25:34.008 --> 25:39.848
<i>we must come together
and face this crisis head on.</i>

25:40.390 --> 25:43.017
<i>I believe it will bring
out the best in us...</i>

25:43.977 --> 25:49.065
<i>...our strength, our humanity,
our faith,</i>

25:49.440 --> 25:53.486
<i>that we will come together
in this time of uncertainty.</i>

25:53.653 --> 25:56.156
<i>My husband was killed
for trying to warn us.</i>

25:57.907 --> 26:00.785
<i>In 12 hours,
320 people will be sacrificed</i>

26:00.952 --> 26:03.997
to extend our oxygen supply
unless we take action.

26:05.957 --> 26:07.876
Dr. Abigail Griffin,
open this door immediately.

26:08.042 --> 26:10.753
The future doesn't belong to
the chancellor or the council.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.672
It belongs to all of us.

26:27.562 --> 26:28.802
I should've told you about her.

26:28.897 --> 26:30.273
It's okay.

26:31.191 --> 26:32.775
I didn't think I'd see her again.

26:33.610 --> 26:35.445
But you wouldn't take off
your wristband.

26:36.196 --> 26:38.281
You had hope.
It's okay, I get it.

26:39.616 --> 26:43.077
I was around, passably cute,
and now it's over.

26:44.787 --> 26:46.289
<i>Hey. I found it.</i>

27:01.304 --> 27:02.513
Can you fix it?

27:02.680 --> 27:04.057
Maybe. But it'll take half a day

27:04.224 --> 27:06.309
just to dry up the components
to see what's broken.

27:06.476 --> 27:08.478
Like I said, it's too late.

27:09.479 --> 27:11.606
Do you have any idea what you did?

27:11.773 --> 27:12.815
Do you even care?

27:12.982 --> 27:15.276
You asked me to help.
I helped.

27:15.443 --> 27:18.821
Three hundred people are gonna
die today because of you.

27:18.988 --> 27:22.075
Hold up.
We don't have to talk to the Ark.

27:22.242 --> 27:24.327
We just have to let them know
we're down here, right?

27:24.494 --> 27:26.996
Yeah, but how do we do
that with no radio?

27:31.167 --> 27:33.795
You've taken an impossible situation
and made it worse.

27:33.962 --> 27:34.963
This will cause a riot.

27:35.129 --> 27:37.006
Good. Maybe we need one.

27:37.173 --> 27:39.425
Guards at double-strength
and on alert station-wide.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.469
I've posted riot teams
in all public areas.

27:41.636 --> 27:42.720
Any reports of unrest?

27:42.887 --> 27:44.973
Not yet, but people are gathering.

27:45.139 --> 27:47.475
There's a crowd of
400 strong right outside.

27:47.642 --> 27:48.643
That's what you've done.

27:48.810 --> 27:50.496
All we can do now is
determine our best option.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.730
Options?
We have no options.

27:52.897 --> 27:56.276
We need time, or everyone on this
station is going to die.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.278
Either in an uprising
or by suffocation.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.838
Those are the options she's given us.

27:59.862 --> 28:03.658
Sir. They sent an emissary
to speak with Abby.

28:03.825 --> 28:05.159
All right.

28:07.370 --> 28:09.914
The people outside are
sending someone in to talk.

28:11.874 --> 28:13.209
To you.

28:16.546 --> 28:18.006
His daughter's a patient of mine.

28:22.719 --> 28:25.722
Hey, Doc.
I saw your video thing.

28:26.723 --> 28:27.890
Crap news, it sounds like.

28:28.057 --> 28:30.184
I'm sorry you had to hear it
like that.

28:30.351 --> 28:31.894
No good way to hear it, right?

28:33.229 --> 28:37.525
Anyway, I'm here to volunteer,
I guess you'd call it.

28:39.027 --> 28:41.571
Volunteer? For what?

28:42.447 --> 28:44.032
Section 17, sir.

28:46.242 --> 28:48.679
Any way you do the math, some of us
are gonna have to jump ship

28:48.703 --> 28:51.414
if everyone's gonna make it, so...

28:51.581 --> 28:53.082
I'm gonna jump.

28:53.249 --> 28:55.251
You'd leave Reese without a father?

28:55.418 --> 28:57.670
This morning, you told me
my daughter was going blind

28:57.837 --> 28:59.756
and there was nothing
I could do to help her.

29:00.590 --> 29:02.091
Turns out there is.

29:03.676 --> 29:04.969
Count me in.

29:09.640 --> 29:12.393
Chancellor, sir,
I'll take a spot in 17.

29:14.437 --> 29:16.147
Give my wife a little extra air.

29:27.617 --> 29:28.951
Jake was right.

29:29.952 --> 29:31.662
It would bring out
the best in us.

29:47.387 --> 29:49.305
We need to launch those flares ASAP

29:49.472 --> 29:51.516
if we have any hope of saving
those people.

29:51.682 --> 29:53.434
Finn, get that control panel to camp.

29:53.601 --> 29:57.313
You, pull out those firing circuits
in one piece or they won't work.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.315
Clarke, can I have a hand?

30:01.401 --> 30:03.611
Work these bolts here gently.

30:03.778 --> 30:05.446
Rocket fuel likes to go boom.

30:09.325 --> 30:11.577
We're going to need power to fire.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.330
They're tying in the
batteries on the dropship.

30:14.497 --> 30:15.808
Should be ready when we get there.

30:15.832 --> 30:18.084
Great.
So, what's the problem?

30:18.292 --> 30:20.336
Nothing. I just...

30:22.463 --> 30:25.550
If we get the rockets to launch,
will they see them from the Ark?

30:25.716 --> 30:28.970
Like the good book says,
it's all about burn time and cloud cover.

30:30.555 --> 30:32.432
But I know your mom will be watching.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.935
I've never seen anyone love someone
the way she loves you.

30:37.186 --> 30:38.980
You know that, right?

30:39.147 --> 30:40.648
I did.

30:42.483 --> 30:43.776
It's complicated.

30:52.869 --> 30:54.662
Here's the final list of volunteers.

30:56.747 --> 30:58.791
They'll report to B deck
in less than an hour.

31:01.669 --> 31:03.296
This is more than enough.

31:04.714 --> 31:06.382
We rejected almost a hundred.

31:06.799 --> 31:09.051
Essential personnel and minors.

31:09.427 --> 31:13.806
Abby's announcement
proved to be very convincing.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.184
I don't think that she
or her husband convinced anyone.

31:16.893 --> 31:19.479
They spoke to something that
was already inside of them.

31:20.354 --> 31:22.857
The new chancellor
should remember that.

31:26.736 --> 31:28.237
I better get to 17.

31:28.863 --> 31:30.299
Don't want to be late
for my own funeral.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.407
Sir.

31:32.033 --> 31:33.233
You don't need to do this now.

31:33.493 --> 31:35.369
I know what I'm doing
is right for my people.

31:36.829 --> 31:38.122
They've inspired me.

31:38.289 --> 31:40.208
No, they volunteered
because you inspired them.

31:40.374 --> 31:44.837
Jake Griffin inspired them
and I executed him.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.799
I executed my friend.

31:48.966 --> 31:50.927
One decision does not define a man.

31:51.928 --> 31:54.472
Jake Griffin is gone.
You're here.

31:55.264 --> 31:57.892
Our survival depends on
having a leader

31:58.059 --> 32:00.603
who can inspire people
to self-sacrifice.

32:02.063 --> 32:03.439
You're that man.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.609
Not me.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.700
Why do you have to work
the double shift?

32:14.867 --> 32:16.244
It's not fair.

32:16.410 --> 32:18.788
Sorry. Things need to get done.

32:20.122 --> 32:21.666
You be good for Miss Lucy.

32:21.832 --> 32:23.834
Thanks, because I was
gonna totally be terrible

32:24.001 --> 32:25.586
if you didn't remind me.

32:25.753 --> 32:27.255
- Come here.
- Stop it.

32:27.922 --> 32:29.002
I can't even see your face.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.758
Seriously.

32:31.133 --> 32:32.510
Okay.

32:33.344 --> 32:34.720
Just give me a kiss.

32:37.098 --> 32:38.266
Hey.

32:44.188 --> 32:46.190
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.667
<i>All nonessential personnel,</i>

33:04.875 --> 33:06.586
<i>please evacuate Section 17.</i>

33:06.752 --> 33:08.254
Have we heard from Raven?

33:10.006 --> 33:11.591
Move it, move it, move it!

33:15.011 --> 33:16.721
<i>You must vacate Section 17...</i>

33:16.887 --> 33:18.472
What changed his mind?

33:19.849 --> 33:21.475
Just the truth.

33:23.519 --> 33:26.939
I reminded him that transitioning
to a new chancellor

33:27.106 --> 33:30.109
would be destabilizing.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.071
We can't afford any more upheaval.

33:34.447 --> 33:35.823
No, we can't.

33:39.910 --> 33:41.329
I left two men.

33:43.205 --> 33:44.665
Monitoring the radio.

33:46.208 --> 33:48.711
If there's any word from Raven,
they'll call down immediately.

33:52.381 --> 33:54.175
I gave clear orders.

33:54.759 --> 33:56.177
Thank you.

34:07.313 --> 34:10.274
Mr. Lemkin, I want to thank
you for your sacrifice.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.027
Don't. This is for my daughter.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.706
You just think about doing right
for the people that are left behind.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.917
Here you go.

35:16.549 --> 35:19.301
Sir, all vents and hatchways
to Section 17 are closed.

35:20.511 --> 35:21.971
We have a hard seal.

35:27.143 --> 35:28.477
Sir?

35:33.691 --> 35:35.109
The order?

35:59.508 --> 36:01.135
Wow!

36:29.705 --> 36:33.125
<i>And we hereby commit
these souls to the deep.</i>

36:34.710 --> 36:39.048
<i>Who at their last,
gave all to the world of the living.</i>

36:39.215 --> 36:41.717
<i>May they be remembered forever,</i>

36:41.884 --> 36:46.055
<i>until there is no more pain,
no more suffering...</i>

36:47.139 --> 36:53.687
<i>...and the abyss itself shall give up
her dead and return them to us.</i>

38:17.438 --> 38:19.023
You think they can see it
from up there?

38:19.231 --> 38:21.066
I don't know. I hope so.

38:22.484 --> 38:24.403
Can you wish on this kind
of shooting star?

38:28.824 --> 38:30.117
Forget it.

38:30.492 --> 38:32.286
I wouldn't even know what
to wish for.

38:34.622 --> 38:36.040
What about you?

39:23.212 --> 39:24.672
You should sleep.

39:28.550 --> 39:29.802
How?

39:49.947 --> 39:51.991
We make the best choices
that we can.

39:54.118 --> 39:56.578
And then we put our
faith in a forgiving God.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.457
Do you think we deserve
to be forgiven?

40:13.637 --> 40:15.139
Did you see that?
