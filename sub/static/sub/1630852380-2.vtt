WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:05.046
(birds singing)

00:10.802 --> 00:12.846
LIAM:
So while she's still not awake,

00:12.887 --> 00:14.472
the doctors remain optimistic.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.766
Optimistic about what?
She's been a coma

00:16.808 --> 00:18.893
for two weeks
with no signs of improvement.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.437
They've seen patients in comas

00:20.478 --> 00:21.980
for months
with positive outcomes.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.565
She's gonna be
in a coma for months?

00:23.606 --> 00:25.316
No one said anything

00:25.358 --> 00:27.110
about Fallon being in a coma
for months.

00:27.152 --> 00:30.488
You just did.
There's still a
trace of infection,

00:30.530 --> 00:32.532
which is what's causing
the swelling around her brain.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.117
But once it clears,
Fallon should wake up.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.827
Now, until then,
the doctor wants us all

00:35.869 --> 00:37.245
just to keep talking to her.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.621
Can she even hear us?

00:38.663 --> 00:40.582
Studies have shown
brain activity

00:40.623 --> 00:43.043
when these patients
hear the voices of loved ones.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.627
Then we will
keep talking to her.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.421
Though I can't get there
till later this afternoon.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.964
Which actually brings me
to my next point.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.967
Right now, the visits are
way too disorganized.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.094
And I don't want her to be
left alone, even for a minute.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.013
So with that in mind,

00:55.055 --> 00:57.390
this chart shows you
when it's your time to visit.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.893
And when you're there, I need
you to share a happy memory.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.353
Okay? About Christmas.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.314
Why does it have
to be about Christmas?

01:04.355 --> 01:05.690
It's Fallon's favorite holiday.
BLAKE:
Yeah, he's right.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.233
Ever since she asked Santa

01:07.275 --> 01:08.818
for a miniature pony
and got one,

01:08.860 --> 01:10.445
the day has always
been magical to her.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.198
If she only knew
how much Santa had to shell out

01:13.239 --> 01:14.574
to fly that thing
across the country.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.618
Well, you tell her
when she wakes up.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.453
KIRBY:
I can do double shifts.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.246
I don't have a lot
going on right now.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.664
Uh, you promised
you'd help

01:21.706 --> 01:23.625
with holiday decor
at the club. Remember?

01:25.168 --> 01:26.628
Though holiday decorations
seem a little trivial right now.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.546
They're not.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.840
When Fallon wakes up,
she won't be thrilled to know

01:30.882 --> 01:33.510
that you were so pessimistic
about her recovery,

01:33.551 --> 01:35.553
you didn't even bother
to hang a string of lights.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.724
It's more than just "a string of
lights," but I get your point.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.186
Okay, last thing. Now, for
the sake of Fallon Unlimited,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.230
this has to
stay a secret.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.774
So no one talk
to the press, okay?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.692
BLAKE:
I love this time of year.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.738
And the traditions that I grew
up with are alive and well,

01:53.780 --> 01:56.366
and for a couple of days
in December,

01:56.407 --> 02:00.120
the whole world just slows down.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.038
And from what I glimpsed
walking through the front door,

02:02.080 --> 02:05.250
I guess it's true what they say
about a Carrington Christmas.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.751
What, that wretched excess
wrapped in boughs of holly

02:06.793 --> 02:08.753
is festive?
Something like that.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.213
I'm the luckiest
man in the world,

02:10.255 --> 02:11.506
to have my family under one roof

02:11.548 --> 02:14.300
in this beautiful house.

02:14.342 --> 02:17.095
I'm surprised to learn that
you have a sentimental side.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.429
Well, you know...

02:19.430 --> 02:21.307
...after Fallon was shot,

02:21.349 --> 02:23.393
I guess this
holiday season

02:23.434 --> 02:26.437
has been a time of reflection.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.941
Not everyone has decades
of happy Christmas memories.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.484
It's something
to be grateful for.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.986
It certainly is.
And I suppose

02:33.027 --> 02:35.405
I'm a little bit more emotional
this year

02:35.446 --> 02:37.031
because, well, you know,
the campaign trail

02:37.073 --> 02:39.409
is exhausting, Darlene.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.578
But if that's what it takes
to be senator,

02:41.619 --> 02:43.121
that's what I'll do.

02:44.455 --> 02:45.707
And what does that mean for you?

02:45.748 --> 02:47.250
You know, off
the record...

02:48.543 --> 02:49.961
...there's a-a
cabinet position

02:50.003 --> 02:52.922
in Washington opening up.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.008
2023 will be here
before we know it.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.260
Cabinet position? Interesting.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.678
Do you have a source
on the Hill?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.722
Well, my source
is the White House.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.682
I'm on their radar

03:02.724 --> 03:04.976
for commerce secretary as soon
as the current one steps down,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.812
which is understandable,
given my success in business.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.940
Uh, Mr. Carrington,
with all due respect,

03:10.982 --> 03:13.109
I do have an insider in D.C.,

03:13.151 --> 03:16.070
and that position has already
been promised to someone.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.655
And it's not you.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.991
Maybe you should check again
with your sources.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.075
I have.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.785
With multiple sources.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.787
I also have a name,
if you'd like to hear it.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.415
No. I'm good.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.875
ALEXIS:
How's Fallon?

03:28.917 --> 03:30.543
What did the doctor say?

03:30.585 --> 03:32.378
He's optimistic,
which means you should be, too.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.715
Optimism is hard to come by
when my daughter is in a coma

03:35.757 --> 03:37.133
and I'm stuck in this hellhole.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.468
Well, I tried
to get you out

03:38.509 --> 03:39.802
on compassionate leave
to see her,

03:39.844 --> 03:41.387
but the request was denied.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.764
I'm not surprised.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.307
The police have made up
their mind.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.725
I'm guilty!
Okay, maybe we don't

03:45.767 --> 03:47.685
shout that for everyone to hear.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.312
They're not even looking
for the real killer.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.147
All they care about
is the attention they'll get

03:51.189 --> 03:53.900
when they convict Atlanta's
hottest socialite for murder.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.193
I wonder
who will play me

03:55.235 --> 03:56.277
in the Lifetime movie.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.987
Maybe a young Sharon Stone?

03:58.029 --> 03:59.864
I think you're getting ahead
of yourself.
Really?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.282
Is that why I'm hearing rumors

04:01.324 --> 04:03.409
the DA is going
to offer me a plea deal?

04:03.451 --> 04:05.954
DAs deal in rumors.
It's a ploy to make you talk,

04:05.995 --> 04:07.497
which you absolutely
should not do.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.040
I have
nothing to say.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.667
And I need your help
if I'm going to be home

04:10.708 --> 04:12.085
in time for Christmas.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.461
Christmas
is the one day

04:13.503 --> 04:15.922
of the year
everyone is nice to me.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.549
After Blake banished me,
I thought I would never

04:18.591 --> 04:23.721
unwrap a shiny bauble from
Fallon or Steven ever again.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.516
And my first Christmas
back in Atlanta,

04:26.557 --> 04:28.142
Fallon bought me
one of everything

04:28.184 --> 04:30.019
from the Neiman Marcus catalog.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.105
How thoughtful.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.731
And wasteful.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.026
Anyway...
(clears throat)

04:37.068 --> 04:40.446
That is a list of everyone
who wants me locked up.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.614
I need you to see
if these people have

04:41.656 --> 04:43.116
an alibi for that night.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.494
Is this a list of everyone
you've ever met?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.496
Small people nurse grudges,

04:48.538 --> 04:50.707
and I know
a lot of small people.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.126
So, you'll help?

04:53.167 --> 04:55.086
Of course.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.047
And I know just the small person
to start with.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.676
I have the paperwork, the lawyer
and a shiny gold pen.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.136
All you need is Brady to sign,
and you're single.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.722
Single and keeping
every hard-earned dollar

05:05.763 --> 05:07.056
in my bank account.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.975
I've been doing
this a long time.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.019
Not many people would waive
their rights to millions.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.146
He knows better
than to put up a fight.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.648
He's also 15 minutes late.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.608
Oh, I'm sure he's on his way.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.362
(line ringing)

05:21.404 --> 05:23.698
MARCO (over phone):
I've been waiting for your call.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.825
Hello? Who is this?

05:25.867 --> 05:28.244
I'm looking for Brady.
I think I have the wrong number.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.663
No, this is the right number.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.291
I'm a friend of your husband.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.169
He owes me a lot of money,
which you are gonna pay me.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.921
So if you ever want to see Brady
alive again,

05:38.963 --> 05:42.133
you're gonna need to do
exactly as I say.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.136
Wait till you see the manor.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.972
I mean, Blake has outdone
himself this year.

05:48.014 --> 05:52.060
I think I saw a snow machine
pulling up when I left.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.312
Hey, you'll see it for yourself
when you come home.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.357
There's so many things
I want to tell you

05:57.398 --> 05:58.566
when you wake up, Fallon.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.318
Like how I forgive you.

06:02.278 --> 06:06.115
And how we can just put
all that Colin stuff behind us.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.951
We shouldn't have fought
about any of this.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.620
People make mistakes.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.246
(knocks on door)
STOUGHTON:
Hey.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.457
You hanging in there?
I'm not sure.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.666
You know, if I stare at her
long enough,

06:15.708 --> 06:17.377
I swear I can see
her eyes flutter.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.171
Can I ask you a question,
Dr. Stoughton?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.422
Yeah, of course.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.049
Fallon and I were

06:23.091 --> 06:24.759
in a pretty heated argument
when she collapsed.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.344
Could that
have caused this?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.678
No.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.347
Fallon's in a coma
because she has

06:29.389 --> 06:31.766
a severe infection,
and we are fighting it

06:31.808 --> 06:34.060
with everything we've got.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.187
You had nothing to do with this.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.605
(monitor beeping)
What's that?
S-Should I get a nurse?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.440
No. No, no, it's
just the batteries

06:39.482 --> 06:41.067
on the pulse oximeter
are running low.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.485
I'll let the nurse know

06:42.527 --> 06:44.695
to replace them
so it stops happening.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.489
You know, you
need to relax,

06:46.531 --> 06:48.241
or you're gonna have
a heart attack, okay?

06:48.282 --> 06:51.619
You need to stay strong.
For both of you.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.080
Thank you.
All right. I'll be back.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.422
Listen to me, Fallon.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.132
I know you can hear me.

07:04.173 --> 07:07.468
I am gonna do whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

07:07.510 --> 07:11.514
We are not spending Christmas
in a hospital room.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.849
I promise.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.477
♪ ♪

07:23.109 --> 07:25.027
It's the guys who were
after Brady in New York.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.654
The ones he owed money to.
They're holding him hostage

07:26.696 --> 07:28.739
and won't let him go
unless I pay them off.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.160
Wow, Brady just finds new ways
to surprise you, doesn't he?

07:32.201 --> 07:35.371
They want $500,000.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.833
500 grand?
What the hell was he doing?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.376
I didn't ask questions.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.337
The guy's life
is in danger.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.674
If they kill him, and I didn't
at least try to help?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
Well, if they're smart,
they won't kill him,

07:48.551 --> 07:50.428
because then they wouldn't
get any money.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.013
Help me understand

07:52.054 --> 07:54.015
why you can't walk away.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.100
Brady's done some bad things,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.686
but he doesn't deserve
to die for this.

08:00.480 --> 08:05.234
So I am going to help him,
with or without your help.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.986
Hopefully with.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.699
Okay, now, I know this might
just look like a plant,

08:11.741 --> 08:15.286
but gotu kola is also
a medicinal herb.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.914
Now, according to the Internet,
it can help boost

08:17.955 --> 08:19.457
cognitive function.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.501
Yes, I know that the Internet
can be wrong.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.794
I can feel you rolling
your eyes right now.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.839
You're staring at a plant.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.799
Like, really hard.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.009
Yeah.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.136
I'm here for my visit.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.679
Ah. Sorry.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.852
(laughs softly)

08:39.894 --> 08:42.730
You won't believe
the day I've had.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.441
Happy memories, Kirby,
not complaints.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.903
Right. Happy memories.
(laughs softly)

08:51.155 --> 08:52.365
Hi, Fallon.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.867
So, it's me. Kirby.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.372
Anyway...

08:59.413 --> 09:02.500
do you remember that Christmas
a few years ago?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.045
It was the time
Blake gave himself a Rolex

09:06.087 --> 09:08.923
and he got you
a fancy blowout kit.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.677
And I got these earrings.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.304
The truth is,

09:15.346 --> 09:17.223
I switched the gift tags
when no one was looking,

09:17.265 --> 09:20.935
because I thought your gift
would be better than mine.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.353
Turns out I was right.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.022
Sorry. Th-- Wow,
I feel much better.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.692
That's the memory that you think
could wake Fallon up?

09:29.610 --> 09:31.988
Do you not have Christmas
in Australia?

09:32.029 --> 09:37.952
Growing up, Christmas was
a fresh start in my family.

09:37.994 --> 09:42.748
For a few days, no one fought
and all was forgiven.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.293
And since Fallon is
so full of spite,

09:45.334 --> 09:48.129
I thought that if
I pissed her off enough,

09:48.170 --> 09:50.923
she would wake up out of anger.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.134
Then forgive me
for the earrings.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.386
Weirdly,
that does make some sense.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.808
MICHAEL:
I really wish you had been
clearer about the fact

10:00.850 --> 10:02.310
that you were
getting a tree.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.478
I was clear. I texted you.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.397
You texted me "We need a tree."

10:06.439 --> 10:08.608
Exactly. Clearly that meant

10:08.649 --> 10:10.401
I was gonna get a tree,
because everyone knows

10:10.443 --> 10:12.862
you can't plan your theme
until your tree is decorated.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.071
You know what?

10:14.113 --> 10:15.948
Have your tree. Have both trees.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.783
I don't care.
I have more important things

10:17.825 --> 10:19.869
to deal with than all of this.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.663
Great. Like I've always said,
two trees are better than one.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.998
(chuckles)

10:24.040 --> 10:26.876
Don't you think
Fallon's gonna love this?

10:26.917 --> 10:29.128
(music playing over stereo)

10:29.170 --> 10:31.839
My grandson's here
with my figgy pudding.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.342
Uh, could you take Dottie
back to her room?

10:34.383 --> 10:36.260
She's, uh,
she's a little confused.
Of course.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.012
(grunts softly)

10:38.054 --> 10:40.348
I know that the 911 call
reporting Bobby Larson's murder

10:40.389 --> 10:42.183
wasn't made outside
of Alexis's penthouse.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.393
It was made outside of
La Mirage, which means

10:44.435 --> 10:46.520
that the murder could have
easily happened before 6:30.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.106
Wow, you're like
a-a British Nancy Drew,

10:49.148 --> 10:51.150
except older and dowdier.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.819
Okay, well, I've shared that
information with the police.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.529
And you're telling me this why?

10:55.571 --> 10:57.365
Well, 'cause I also shared
with them your involvement

10:57.406 --> 11:00.034
with Bobby Larson over that
whole anti-aging drug fiasco.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.287
Which proves that you're
the one with the motive.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.789
Actually, I think the detectives

11:04.830 --> 11:06.666
should be here soon
to, uh, interview you.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.668
All right, well,
I have nothing to hide, so...

11:08.709 --> 11:10.002
Oh, you have an alibi?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.547
Tell me something,
Dame Judy Wench,

11:13.589 --> 11:17.259
why are you so hell-bent on
trying to pin this murder on me?

11:17.301 --> 11:19.512
I just want to get our mother
out of jail, don't you?

11:19.553 --> 11:21.180
Have you thought for a second

11:21.222 --> 11:23.849
that Alexis actually
might be guilty?

11:23.891 --> 11:25.768
You know, I've encountered
a lot of guilty people

11:25.810 --> 11:27.520
in my line of work,
and they all kind of have

11:27.561 --> 11:30.773
a similar look that I've got
quite good at recognizing.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.818
Of course, if you have proof
that you weren't

11:33.859 --> 11:35.277
at Alexis's penthouse
that night,

11:35.319 --> 11:36.779
you should have nothing
to worry about.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.239
Then I don't have anything
to worry about.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.033
Uh, I am going to go,

11:41.075 --> 11:43.077
because I do have
patients to worry about.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.704
CRISTAL:
I'm worried.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.665
I just found out that no one
has seen Beto in Mexico,

11:47.707 --> 11:50.000
or heard from him
since he left Atlanta.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.838
Maybe cutting him off
from the company was too harsh.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.131
After what he did to you,
I couldn't care less

11:55.172 --> 11:56.632
if he went
on a three-week bender

11:56.674 --> 11:58.259
and he's laying
in a sewer somewhere.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.803
Do you remember
that reporter

12:00.845 --> 12:03.347
at PPA that asked me
about the cabinet position?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.475
Sounds familiar. What about her?

12:06.517 --> 12:07.768
Well, apparently,
none of that was true.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.270
The White House
already has a candidate

12:09.311 --> 12:11.105
for commerce and it is not me.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.108
How do you know?
I made some phone calls,
all right?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.694
We need to find that reporter,
ask her who her source was

12:16.736 --> 12:17.903
and then kill that person.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.613
And then
sue the channel

12:19.655 --> 12:21.282
for gross defamation,
then maybe circle back around

12:21.323 --> 12:23.284
to the reporter
and murder her, too.

12:25.661 --> 12:30.124
Oh, honey, I'm-I'm not
really gonna kill someone.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.418
I just need to find out
what the truth is.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.590
You're doing that thing.
What thing?

12:37.631 --> 12:39.467
That thing,
where you look to the right

12:39.508 --> 12:41.927
and you bite your lip when you
don't want to tell me something.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.638
No, I'm not.
And I don't do that.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.348
Just tell me. I know you're
gonna tell me eventually,

12:46.390 --> 12:47.892
so let's just save us some time.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.772
Fine.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.649
I paid that reporter to ask you
about the cabinet position

12:55.691 --> 12:57.777
so you would stay in the race.
What?

12:57.818 --> 12:58.819
Honey, we're supposed
to be a team,

12:58.861 --> 13:00.154
and you went behind my back?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.864
Only because I knew
you could win,

13:01.906 --> 13:03.699
and I didn't want
you to drop out.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.035
So there is no cabinet position
in my future,

13:06.076 --> 13:07.870
and you ruined my best chance

13:07.912 --> 13:09.455
at getting the land
for the airport.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.791
The lieutenant governor
was handing it to me.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.250
You are still in the lead.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.878
Blake, please.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.421
Say something.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.298
Oh, you know what? I'm gonna go.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.008
Before I say something I regret.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.551
This is definitely not

13:22.593 --> 13:25.179
the most wonderful time
of the year so far.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.771
Hello?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.105
A little help?

13:35.147 --> 13:36.482
You look like you got it.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.651
Ooh.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.820
What are you doing? Sudoku?

13:40.861 --> 13:42.905
Paperwork.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.241
You gave your bar manager
the week off, remember?

13:45.282 --> 13:48.327
Oh, that's right. I really am
great with the Christmas spirit.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.912
What is all this?

13:49.954 --> 13:54.500
Nativity sets,
gold-leaf garland, snow globes.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.793
What are you planning to do
with all of it?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.087
Hello?
We are on decorating duty.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.839
Anyway, you know
I'm all about

13:59.880 --> 14:03.217
over-the-top, but I can't get
over the top by myself.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.426
I need your help.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.345
What are you talking about?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.222
Just please help me
decorate the club.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.599
What about Kirby?
She doesn't work here anymore.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.060
And she doesn't have an eye
for decorating like you do.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.521
Your flocked white pine was...
(sighs) ...perfection.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.523
You're on your own.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.526
Look, decorating The Sahara Club
was not on my to-do list today.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.947
I don't know why you're being
such a Scrooge,

14:24.989 --> 14:27.241
but it is not a good
look on you, buddy.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.993
Not a good look.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.370
Dr. Waldenburg, hey.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.248
Do you remember me taking
notes in the observation room

14:34.290 --> 14:37.126
during a surgery you brilliantly
performed on the 15th?

14:37.167 --> 14:41.255
I'm flattered, I do recall
I was brilliant on the 15th,

14:41.297 --> 14:43.257
but I don't recall
you being there.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.425
Okay, I was considering
promoting you

14:44.466 --> 14:45.843
to head of surgical.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.469
But I need someone
with a good memory,

14:47.511 --> 14:48.929
i-if you catch my drift.

14:48.971 --> 14:49.930
(stammers)

14:49.972 --> 14:50.973
Hold that thought.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.101
Hey, hey, Dr. P-- uh, Park.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.729
Hey, oh--
We're both busy surgeons,

14:56.770 --> 14:58.147
so I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.690
If somebody asks
where I was

14:59.732 --> 15:02.484
on the 15th
between 5:00 and 6:30,

15:02.526 --> 15:04.028
I was right here, understood?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.739
The 15th?

15:06.780 --> 15:09.241
But I wasn't in the hospital
on the 15th.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.784
Oh, no, where were you?

15:10.826 --> 15:12.661
Hiding in a hotel room
with your scrub nurse?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.622
Dating a subordinate
is grounds for firing.

15:14.663 --> 15:18.417
However...
However, uh, if both parties
sign a consent form,

15:18.459 --> 15:21.211
they're protected, so I'll
email you one, Doctor.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.799
Dr. Carrington, are you
aware of the new policy?

15:25.841 --> 15:27.301
Dr. Waldenburg?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.677
HR and legal,

15:28.719 --> 15:30.721
we reviews all
promotions. Sorry.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.681
Bribing people for alibis?

15:32.723 --> 15:34.266
(tongue clicks) Wow,
it's just not a great

15:34.308 --> 15:36.018
or innocent look.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.353
I guess you're just
not as memorable

15:37.394 --> 15:39.355
as you thought you were.

15:39.396 --> 15:40.856
Who are we cornering next?

15:48.739 --> 15:51.158
Well, I don't know
who Alexis's plastic surgeon is

15:51.200 --> 15:53.452
these days,
but I got to hand it to the guy.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.287
She doesn't look anything
like the woman I married.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.540
I read that photos of
loved ones can, uh,

15:58.582 --> 15:59.959
elicit an emotional response

16:00.000 --> 16:02.169
that might help coma
patients wake up.

16:02.211 --> 16:06.048
Did you also read how
they're supposed to see them?

16:06.090 --> 16:08.759
Well, it's even just the feeling
of being surrounded by love

16:08.801 --> 16:10.177
that can help.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.846
Hey, I-I appreciate the effort.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.479
(exhales)
Hi, Fallon.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.272
I know
you're gonna wake up.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.859
We have too many Christmas
traditions to continue, right?

16:25.901 --> 16:30.906
Like handing the staff
their bonus checks together,

16:30.948 --> 16:32.574
dressing Bo
in Christmas sweaters

16:32.616 --> 16:34.410
for the annual Christmas card.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.870
Anyway, my
favorite tradition

16:36.912 --> 16:39.748
is the one we restarted
a few years ago,

16:39.790 --> 16:41.667
just the two of us.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.964
(engine stops)

16:47.006 --> 16:49.508
(grunts)
The Carrington backwoods, huh?

16:49.550 --> 16:52.594
This is where we find
the perfect tree.

16:52.636 --> 16:56.015
Our own land.
A real Carrington tree.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.433
There's also a huge
Christmas tree lot

16:57.474 --> 16:59.059
right across the street
from your office.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.311
Which is basically the same
thing and less freezing.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.106
It's not about comfort, it's
about carrying on a tradition.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.482
You've said "tradition"
so many times I feel like

17:05.524 --> 17:07.067
I'm watching
Fiddler on the Roof.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.986
The Carrington tradition
of cutting down a tree

17:09.028 --> 17:11.405
was started by my father
when I was young.

17:11.447 --> 17:14.450
And it means a lot that you've
agreed to continue it with me.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.659
Anything to get out
of wrapping gifts

17:15.701 --> 17:17.119
with Steven for Toys for Tots.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.746
Well, I invited him
to come with us,

17:18.787 --> 17:20.164
but he said
we'd be hurting nature,

17:20.205 --> 17:22.374
and he refused
to be a part of tree-a-cide.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.460
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

17:24.501 --> 17:26.086
I have one simple rule:
think big.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.213
Specifically,
bigger than Warren Buffet's.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.758
His tree seemed to take up
the entire background

17:30.799 --> 17:32.426
of his annual MSNBC interview.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.635
Mm.

17:33.677 --> 17:34.803
That was obnoxious.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.805
This is the one.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.686
Whoa-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.063
I didn't realize you meant

17:44.104 --> 17:45.647
you were gonna
chop it down yourself,

17:45.689 --> 17:48.108
because I'm looking at you
and all I see

17:48.150 --> 17:49.693
is The Christmas
Chain Saw Massacre.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.029
Trust me, it'll be fine.
No, Dad, wait.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.530
Let's call Tony the gardener.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.991
I mean, he's younger,
he's-he's stronger.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.493
He's more handy.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.911
Blake Carrington does
not let another man

17:58.952 --> 18:01.205
chop down his Christmas tree.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.207
(engine roars)

18:06.627 --> 18:08.587
Oh, crap.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.755
Run!

18:13.383 --> 18:14.676
(car alarm sounding)

18:19.014 --> 18:21.517
Okay, maybe it wasn't
my finest hour,

18:21.558 --> 18:25.229
although I am glad
I spent it with you.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.232
You warned me not to cut down
that tree,

18:28.273 --> 18:30.692
but I let my ego get in the way.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.029
Yeah, I blamed the wind
and the tree,

18:34.071 --> 18:36.198
the chain saw,
everything but myself.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.243
And the truth is,
it was... it was all me.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.875
(exhales)

18:46.917 --> 18:51.004
And apparently I haven't changed
as much as I thought.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.885
Anyway, thank you

18:56.927 --> 18:59.304
for sticking with the
"valet crashed my car" story.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.114
I haven't told you this
often enough,

19:17.156 --> 19:21.368
but I am proud of the woman
that you have become.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.579
And your future
is too bright to give up on

19:23.620 --> 19:26.999
and we have too much
to do together.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.627
So many more traditions
to start.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.840
So, um...

19:37.885 --> 19:39.970
(exhales)

19:41.889 --> 19:44.683
...you keep fighting.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.435
Please.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.069
Put the money on the bench.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.700
Let him go.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.660
Get him.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.624
MAN:
Looks right.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.253
Let's just get out of here
before they change their minds.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.922
Well, there's one thing
we agree on.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.590
I thought you had a plan.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.133
You're going to just let them
walk away with my money?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.343
Go get them.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.594
Watch it, old man.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.180
FBI! Everybody...
(siren wailing)

20:23.222 --> 20:25.807
AGENT: Don't do anything stupid!
All right, all right.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.726
(indistinct shouting)

20:27.768 --> 20:28.727
You set them up.

20:28.769 --> 20:29.937
(handcuffs clicking)

20:29.978 --> 20:32.481
Why didn't you tell me?

20:32.522 --> 20:35.150
'Cause I needed
you to act scared.
How did you even...

20:35.192 --> 20:38.237
I still have some friends
in law enforcement.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.285
Don't bother thanking me.
I didn't do this for you.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.716
Thanks, Detective.
The exit's that way.
Thank you.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.303
I'll be right back.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.097
Why did the detective
just leave?

21:05.138 --> 21:07.015
Why aren't you being marched
out of here with handcuffs?

21:07.057 --> 21:09.309
Because he knows I was here
and I have an alibi to prove it.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.061
Oh, so you lied
to the detective?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.896
You do realize
that's also illegal?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.982
Why would I lie when the truth
will set me free?

21:15.023 --> 21:16.566
See, the night
that Dr. Larson died

21:16.608 --> 21:19.611
was be the night
before Dottie's surgery.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.238
She's one of my
favorite patients,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.990
she was feeling
nervous, so I,

21:23.031 --> 21:24.783
I took her for a walk
around the hospital grounds

21:24.825 --> 21:26.868
just to calm her nerves.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.329
Dottie confirmed this
with the detective and,

21:29.371 --> 21:30.747
I don't know, he was satisfied.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.165
So they believed

21:32.207 --> 21:34.126
a post-surgical old woman
whose memory

21:34.167 --> 21:36.211
is probably still foggy
from the anesthesia?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.130
I thought you were a lawyer.
I am a lawyer.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.798
Then stop being so judgy.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.508
Aging is a beautiful thing.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.385
(laughs softly)
And according

21:43.427 --> 21:48.098
to her medical records, Dottie
has excellent neuro function.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.641
I made sure of that.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.277
How did I do?
Oh, you did great.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.653
And you know
what it's time for now?

22:01.695 --> 22:02.946
(gasps)
Pudding.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.865
(laughs):
Pudding.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.535
BLAKE:
This is beautiful.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.829
I'm sorry I got upset
and I yelled at you.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.417
Cristal, I don't want to
fight with you anymore.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.795
Besides, it's not like
you're blameless here.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.340
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.680
I am sorry for planting
the idea with the reporter.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.599
But I wanted you
to stay in the race,

22:30.640 --> 22:32.642
and I knew your ego
wouldn't be able

22:32.684 --> 22:35.020
to resist a cabinet position
possibility.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.813
Well, you are right about that.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.149
I had a long talk
with Fallon earlier.

22:39.191 --> 22:44.279
It was a-a one-sided
conversation, but, um...

22:44.321 --> 22:47.657
I realized that my ego
has gotten in the way before,

22:47.699 --> 22:50.702
with disastrous results.
(chuckles)

22:50.744 --> 22:52.829
This may surprise you,
but your big ego

22:52.871 --> 22:56.083
is one of the things
I love the most about you.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.918
Many people find it charming.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.419
If I'm being honest,

22:59.461 --> 23:02.089
I've lost my taste
for becoming a senator.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.049
All this man of the people BS?

23:04.091 --> 23:06.051
It's just not, it's not me.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.470
I think I was blinded

23:08.512 --> 23:10.680
by my trying to secure
the land for the airport.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.015
So now what?

23:12.057 --> 23:13.433
Well, I'm-I'm dropping
out of the race.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.477
If that makes you happy,
I support you.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.437
Being in the lead,
you'll be able

23:17.479 --> 23:18.855
to get an even better deal

23:18.897 --> 23:20.732
from that lieutenant governor.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.068
I like the way you think.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.738
(laughs)

23:26.780 --> 23:28.073
Mmm.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.160
One more thing.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.537
I'm sorry I steamrolled
your worries about Beto.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.704
He's still your brother.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.164
Oh, I'm not worried anymore.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.999
Beto was seen getting
on a plane to the Bahamas.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.336
I think a vacation
will be good for him.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.755
Have you left this spot?

23:43.797 --> 23:45.674
Did you not hear
what I said before?

23:45.715 --> 23:47.300
I did, but I'm trying
to ignore the fact

23:47.342 --> 23:48.927
that you're Grinching out
so hard.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.805
What is wrong with you?
You're ignoring me.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.141
Wait, are you mad at me?
I didn't do anything.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.767
It's Fallon.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.562
I can't pretend to care
about decorations

23:58.603 --> 24:01.231
while she's lying
in a hospital bed unconscious.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.151
She's always seemed
indestructible,

24:04.192 --> 24:05.235
since I've known her.
Yeah, I know how you feel.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.028
I feel the same way.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.738
I haven't even gone to see her.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.116
Neither have I.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.368
It would just make it too...
Too real.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.079
I think we're just dealing
with the same feelings

24:16.121 --> 24:18.039
in different ways.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.916
Why else would I be
decorating the club

24:19.958 --> 24:21.835
with the mania
of Martha Stewart?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.086
Because you're you?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.172
Okay, yeah.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.465
But I am also

24:26.506 --> 24:27.674
trying whatever I can

24:27.716 --> 24:30.594
to keep my mind off Fallon.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.220
Maybe you should try helping?

24:32.262 --> 24:33.430
Because sitting
here worrying

24:33.472 --> 24:35.765
clearly isn't doing it for you.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.434
ALEXIS:
So how did it go?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.979
I spoke to all the people
on your list,

24:41.021 --> 24:43.273
and everyone has an alibi.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.192
Everyone? I was sure

24:45.233 --> 24:48.028
Mimi Rose Prescott
was still harboring a grudge

24:48.069 --> 24:50.030
from the time I ran her over.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.157
Okay, well, I don't want to know
anything about that.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.992
Look, I am going to find out
who's responsible

24:54.034 --> 24:56.036
for Dr. Larson's murder, okay?

24:56.077 --> 24:57.871
I promise you,
I am not giving up.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.123
That makes one of us.
I'm going to see

25:00.165 --> 25:02.417
what the terms
of the plea deal are.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.878
Everyone in my family
already thinks I'm guilty.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.756
Hey. Not everyone.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.469
Funny how life turns out,
isn't it?

25:12.511 --> 25:13.970
I always dreamed

25:14.012 --> 25:17.098
that I would host Christmas
with my children,

25:17.140 --> 25:21.353
eventually my grandchildren,
in my marvelous penthouse.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.480
And now I will
be spending

25:23.522 --> 25:26.358
all of my Christmases
behind bars.

You said dinner
last night was amazing.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.489
You also said
that Christmas tree

26:56.531 --> 26:58.658
made out of doughnuts
at the bakery was amazing.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.160
I thought you were
supposed to be a writer.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.369
Dinner was delicious.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.954
(laughs)
And that Christmas tree

27:02.996 --> 27:05.248
was insane.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.751
But being alone with you
is more than amazing.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.712
This is the best Christmas
I've had in a long time.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.339
Better than the Christmas
where your mom

27:12.380 --> 27:14.257
threw a buttered rum
at your father?

27:14.299 --> 27:16.635
Because that one sounds
hard to top.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.721
Okay, can I open my present now?

27:19.763 --> 27:21.431
I mean, I've been
looking everywhere.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.682
Where did you hide it?

27:22.724 --> 27:24.100
Wait, you...

27:24.142 --> 27:25.226
you told me
we weren't doing presents.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.603
Very funny.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.605
Are you kidding?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.899
Because one of us isn't.
I'm pretty sure it's me.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.151
No, I'm not kidding.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.445
When your girlfriend says
you're not doing presents,

27:35.487 --> 27:37.238
it doesn't mean you're
not doing presents.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.865
It just means
not a lot of them.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.075
I mean, what were you thinking?

27:40.116 --> 27:41.534
I was listening to you.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.286
Well, what I say
and what I mean

27:43.328 --> 27:45.664
are almost always
two different things.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.999
That's good to know.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.503
Without gifts, how else
can I quantify your love for me?

27:51.544 --> 27:53.630
Fallon, this doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.382
This means that
I don't play games

27:55.423 --> 27:58.677
when it comes to the things
that are important to me.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.512
Maybe you should do the same.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.597
(exhales)

28:02.639 --> 28:03.807
Fine.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.850
You're right.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.852
It's Christmas.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.522
And I don't want to spoil it
by fighting with you.

28:10.563 --> 28:14.192
So if you say you're sorry,
I'll forgive you.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.569
I'm sorry.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.322
Trust me, I don't want
to fight like this ever again.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.741
Then let's not.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.868
You're forgiven.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.043
Now, that was amazing.

28:37.757 --> 28:41.803
LIAM:
I meant it when I said that
was the best Christmas ever.

28:41.845 --> 28:45.056
Even with the fighting.

28:45.098 --> 28:48.643
My mom didn't really care
about the holidays.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.979
We never even got a tree
half the time.

28:51.020 --> 28:55.108
I spent my childhood asking
for a BMX bike every year.

28:57.318 --> 29:01.906
But instead all I got
was a few million shares

29:01.948 --> 29:06.578
of some new company
for my investment portfolio.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.955
Which, yeah,
sounds great, but...

29:10.874 --> 29:13.626
...I think she still has
control over that account.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.549
I should have realized that you
really did want a present.

29:21.259 --> 29:25.430
And I think I just realized that

29:25.472 --> 29:28.266
I don't want you to wake up
so I can forgive you.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.980
I need you to wake up
so you can forgive me.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.274
For believing Eva.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.070
And after that I want to spend
every Christmas with you.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.534
(chuckles):
Until we're so old that
we can't even open presents.

29:46.576 --> 29:50.121
But that day is not today.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.373
I, uh, I got you something.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.087
(music box playing
"I'll Be Home for Christmas")

30:02.258 --> 30:04.886
That's all I want
for Christmas, Fallon.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.723
Is for you to be home.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.187
(Stoughton clears throat)

30:14.229 --> 30:16.689
(softly):
Hi.

30:16.731 --> 30:20.693
Um, I got Fallon's latest
blood work results back.

30:20.735 --> 30:25.615
And, um, the good news is,
there's no sign of infection.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.742
The, um, the bad news
is that we were hoping,

30:27.784 --> 30:29.494
when the infection cleared up,

30:29.536 --> 30:32.455
that the inflammation
would go down and she'd wake up.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.501
Okay, um...

30:36.543 --> 30:39.629
Uh, so what are you saying?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.047
When will she wake up?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.966
I can't give you a timeline
on that,

30:43.007 --> 30:45.593
because I don't know.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.222
I'm sorry.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.196
These papers are going straight
to the court to be filed.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.283
Of course.
You'll hear no protest from me.

31:08.324 --> 31:11.035
I want this done
as much as you do.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.746
Not as much, trust me.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.042
I guess he and I aren't gonna
be bonding anytime soon.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.419
What a brilliant observation.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.004
You've clearly lost

31:21.045 --> 31:24.007
your moral compass,
if you ever even had one.

31:24.048 --> 31:28.469
I saved your life today
because I'm a decent person.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.096
So, you're welcome.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.140
Come on, Dominique,
we've been through so much.

31:32.181 --> 31:35.059
Is this how our story ends?

31:35.101 --> 31:38.438
Because I don't feel
like this is goodbye.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.648
That's where
you're wrong, again.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.401
You lied to me.
I can't trust you.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.403
Which I always knew, all along.

31:45.445 --> 31:49.699
So, yes, it is
goodbye, forever.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.242
If you know what's
good for you.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.418
JEFF:
If you ever show up

32:00.460 --> 32:03.004
in Atlanta again,
it'll be the last time

32:03.046 --> 32:06.341
you feel that warm
Southern sun on your face.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.976
Champagne?

32:17.018 --> 32:18.645
Feels like more
of a Scotch moment.

32:18.686 --> 32:22.357
I was almost conned
by Alexis and Brady,

32:22.398 --> 32:25.485
I was in an FBI sting,
just got divorced.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.445
Is it weird

32:27.487 --> 32:31.616
that I think
this is a fabulous Christmas?

32:31.658 --> 32:34.035
It's not where I thought
you were going.

32:34.077 --> 32:37.330
Brady's out of my life,
you're healthy again,

32:37.372 --> 32:40.083
and we're in a good place.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.668
We're partners.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.464
A toast to us.
We've come a long way.

32:46.506 --> 32:50.635
It took some time,
but we got here.

32:52.887 --> 32:54.973
So, Fallon's progress
is stalled.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.724
And there's
no indication

32:56.766 --> 32:58.601
when she'll wake up.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.478
But it doesn't seem likely
to happen by Christmas.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.021
You mean, your miracle plant
didn't work?

33:02.063 --> 33:03.523
CRISTAL:
Blake, this isn't
Liam's fault.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.566
Yeah, I know. She
has the best doctors.

33:05.608 --> 33:08.569
There's a wing of this hospital
with our name on it.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.113
Someone should be
doing something.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.739
CRISTAL:
She's getting
24-hour care.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.033
JEFF:
She's right.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.535
This is the best place
for her to be.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.413
We're not losing hope.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.708
Since the paparazzi
love to snap photos

33:21.749 --> 33:25.211
of Fallon during her annual
Christmas shopping spree,

33:25.253 --> 33:27.880
this year we will put
out a press release

33:27.922 --> 33:30.091
that instead of gifts,
Fallon will be donating

33:30.133 --> 33:31.759
a year's salary to charity.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.137
I can take care of that.
Thank you.

33:34.178 --> 33:38.182
Jeff, you think you can put
out a story in Hot Tea Atlanta

33:38.224 --> 33:41.019
that Fallon and I were seen
in Fiji frolicking in the waves,

33:41.060 --> 33:43.354
and she's clearly recovered
from her gunshot wound?

33:43.396 --> 33:45.565
I'm sure there's plenty
of stock footage of Fallon

33:45.606 --> 33:47.066
in that exact scenario.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.444
Thank you.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.613
Okay. I think we're covered.

33:55.742 --> 33:59.620
We need you back, Fallon.
And that's an order.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.417
(high-pitched whirring)

34:10.423 --> 34:14.010
Hi. Hi, security?
Yeah, this is Amanda Carrington.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.720
Um, I've just seen a drone
flying by,

34:15.762 --> 34:18.181
and it looked like
it was recording.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.684
SECURITY:
Yeah, it flies by every night
around this same time.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.102
Every night?

34:23.144 --> 34:24.479
Yep, for the past month.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.230
Some kind of Peeping Tom.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.648
We haven't been able to track
where it's coming from,

34:27.690 --> 34:29.734
but we'll continue to monitor.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.486
Thank you. Um, and if you
could just let me know

34:31.527 --> 34:33.029
when you have that information.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.655
There may be some footage
on there that I need.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.616
Sure thing.
Have a good night, ma'am.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.873
What the hell
is going on in here?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.167
Have you two
lost your minds?

34:46.209 --> 34:48.461
Fallon is in a coma
and you've decorated in here

34:48.503 --> 34:50.129
like Santa on LSD.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.380
Thank you.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.840
Was that a compliment?

34:52.882 --> 34:54.759
I'm taking it as a compliment.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.594
It's pretty magical, isn't it?

34:56.636 --> 34:58.679
I already feel dizzy.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.098
We're hoping some
of the Christmas magic from here

35:00.139 --> 35:01.933
can make its way
to Fallon's hospital room.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.143
If we carry on as though
things are normal,

35:04.185 --> 35:05.686
maybe they will be normal.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.980
This isn't normal.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.233
You haven't even seen
the best part.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.114

35:20.660 --> 35:23.496
I know you've been
avoiding visiting Fallon.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.040
But I think it's time
for you to go to the hospital.

35:32.296 --> 35:35.007
Hey, Fallon. How are you?

35:35.967 --> 35:39.011
What? I don't know
what to say.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.638
We're sorry for
not coming sooner.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.265
We are.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.475
I am.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.727
But we've been
talking about you a lot.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.521
And the Sahara Club
looks festive.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.231
I think you would love it.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.525
We're gonna leave the
decorations up for you to see

35:52.567 --> 35:54.193
when you get up.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.946
SAM:
So I hope that's soon,
because, you know,

35:56.988 --> 35:59.073
I-I hate seeing
Christmas decorations

35:59.115 --> 36:01.200
on the first week
of January, so...

36:01.242 --> 36:02.618
I wonder if she
can hear us.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.828
MICHAEL:
I think so.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.414
We just wanted to say hi.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.043
We'll be back later, okay?
(sniffles)

36:11.085 --> 36:15.840
So, sleep tight, sweet dreams.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.217
Can you say that
to someone in a coma?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.677
When they said a family member
was here,

36:19.719 --> 36:21.429
I assumed it was one
of my children.

36:21.470 --> 36:24.265
I didn't realize that included
my former mother-in-law

36:24.307 --> 36:26.809
turned Muppet.
(laughs softly)

36:26.851 --> 36:30.479
I see they don't let you wash
your hair extensions in here.

36:30.521 --> 36:34.275
If you came to exchange barbs,
I'm not in the mood.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.694
That's fine. I have a lot
of Christmas shopping to do.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.613
I'll keep the visit short.

36:38.654 --> 36:41.741
I just wanted to see what
rock bottom looked like for you.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.576
Happy?
Delighted.

36:43.618 --> 36:47.121
Oh, and your plan with Brady
to screw me out of my fortune?

36:47.163 --> 36:48.581
(tongue clicks)

36:48.623 --> 36:50.082
It didn't pan out.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.460
It's a shame he got caught
in your web,

36:52.501 --> 36:54.045
but he's been dealt with.

36:54.086 --> 36:56.088
It must have come
as quite a shock to learn

36:56.130 --> 36:58.299
he had no problem
selling you out.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.510
Not really, and I've moved on.

37:01.552 --> 37:06.390
And after a good night's sleep
on my 2,000 thread count sheets,

37:06.432 --> 37:09.101
I'll awake refreshed
and ready to celebrate

37:09.143 --> 37:11.604
the holidays with my family.

37:11.646 --> 37:15.024
And if you ever do
get out of here,

37:15.066 --> 37:19.070
you better not cross me again,
or I'll make you pay for it.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.864
Guard? Help.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.117
There's a crazy lady here
and she's threatening my life.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.662
Oh, I almost forgot.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.282

40:10.324 --> 40:12.410
Of course you did. Hey.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.954

Yeah.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.289

No, I'm-I'm sorry, you're right.
It's not a big deal.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.597
No, I'm sorry. Will this help?

40:34.849 --> 40:35.808

"F" word and be happy, okay?

40:47.153 --> 40:49.738
I am happy. Trust
me, I'm so happy.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.741
Good. I got you
one more thing.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.035
LIAM (laughs):
What?

40:55.077 --> 40:57.079
I hear it's a bit of a beast,

40:57.121 --> 40:59.415
but you can handle it, right?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.959
Yeah. Thank you.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.544
Everyone is where
they belong.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.212
My family is here.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.256
Alexis is in jail.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.050
This is nice.
We're truly blessed.

41:12.219 --> 41:15.848
BETO:
Wow, clothes really do
make the woman.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.933
But shoulders back
when you walk.

41:17.975 --> 41:22.229
Say, "Oh, darling,
it's beautiful."

41:22.271 --> 41:23.564
WOMAN (Southern accent):
"Oh, darling..."

41:23.606 --> 41:27.276
Without the gum.
And still too much drawl.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.446
We haven't had a meal together,
but I have a feeling

41:30.488 --> 41:31.780
I'm gonna have to remind you

41:31.822 --> 41:33.282
to close your mouth
when you chew.

41:35.409 --> 41:39.288
Now, now, don't talk
to your sister like that.

41:42.041 --> 41:45.085
Merry Christmas.
