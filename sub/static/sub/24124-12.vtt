WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:21.291 --> 01:22.583
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:22.583 --> 01:25.375
It's almost time.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.000
Piglet:
What's going on, Pooh?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.333
Don't worry, Piglet.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.375
You'll find out.

01:48.958 --> 01:50.083
Quiet.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.833
Ahem.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.250
And now we begin our play,

01:56.250 --> 02:00.125
which we callThe Legend
of Sheriff Piglet.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.708
Me?

02:01.708 --> 02:03.625
Shh. Not yet.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.958
Ahem. Act 1.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.750
Our story begins.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.333
Hoo!

02:13.333 --> 02:14.875
set down a spell

02:14.875 --> 02:16.708
that we're gonna tell

02:16.708 --> 02:18.875
the rugged west

02:18.875 --> 02:23.833
above the rest

02:23.833 --> 02:25.625
Actually, he doesn't
stand above the rest

02:25.625 --> 02:27.625
- in the physical sense--
- Why, ya feather brain,

02:27.625 --> 02:29.583
quit flapping
your beak and sing.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.958
he knows no fear

02:31.958 --> 02:33.958
when danger's near

02:33.958 --> 02:37.291
of the Plains

02:42.708 --> 02:43.833
Me?

02:43.833 --> 02:45.291
I don't want to be sheriff.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.625
Ah, that's okay. Ha.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.125
You probably won't get
through the desert anyway.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.375
Desert?

03:05.625 --> 03:09.166
Water. Water.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.625
Honey. Honey.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.250
It's the end, I tell you.

03:15.250 --> 03:19.333
We're lost,
fried in the desert sun.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.625
Uh, excuse me, uh--

03:20.625 --> 03:24.833
Scorched in the searing sands.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.875
We're-- Whoo!

03:28.708 --> 03:32.625
...parched in
a waterless wasteland.

03:32.625 --> 03:34.958
We're-- We're--

03:34.958 --> 03:36.625
Does anyone have a towel?

03:36.625 --> 03:38.625
- Hello!
-  Hello!

03:38.625 --> 03:40.833
Is anybody here?

03:40.833 --> 03:42.333
No!

03:43.458 --> 03:47.333
Excuse us. Pardon. Say, there.

03:47.333 --> 03:51.000
Say! Whoa, there,
you prairie doggies.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.083
I believe
you're expecting us.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.208
We're in the play, you know.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.958
Better you than us.
Run for your lives!

03:58.958 --> 04:00.875
A band of horse thieves
is coming to town,

04:00.875 --> 04:03.083
- and we're clearing out!
- You'd best do the same.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.458
They're mighty ornery.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.958
Oh, dear.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.208
Perhaps we should
tell the sheriff.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.458
Consider yourself told!

04:10.458 --> 04:12.291
Congratulations.

04:12.291 --> 04:15.750
You're now
the official sheriff.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.375
Me? Sheriff?

04:17.375 --> 04:19.000
Yep. And whoever's sheriff

04:19.000 --> 04:20.625
has to stop
them horse thieves.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.958
Really? Where does it
say that?

04:22.958 --> 04:27.250
Right there inThe Legend
of Sheriff Piglet.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.458
- It's you.
- Me?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.875
I see lots of horses
but no thieves.

04:42.583 --> 04:46.125
You don't get the picture
here, fellas.

04:46.125 --> 04:50.958
We're nothorsethieves.
We're horsethieves--

04:50.958 --> 04:53.166
horses who steal things.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.833
Comprendo?

04:54.833 --> 04:57.291
All: Oh.

04:57.291 --> 05:00.625
Well, heh heh, in that case,
we'll just run along.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.708
Hate to break it
to you, chum,

05:02.708 --> 05:05.333
but we've got us
a little problem.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.833
Ah, you do?

05:07.833 --> 05:11.166
See, that badge
makes you sheriff,

05:11.166 --> 05:15.291
and sheriffs
and horse thieves
don't get along.

05:15.291 --> 05:16.750
Right?

05:16.750 --> 05:19.708
And since I'm Nasty Jack,

05:19.708 --> 05:22.500
the world's meanest
horse thief--

05:22.500 --> 05:23.958
--

05:23.958 --> 05:27.000
I'm gonna
have to trounce you.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.500
Trounce?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.458
Is that anything
like b-b-bounce?

05:31.458 --> 05:33.958
Nah. Let me show you.

05:38.708 --> 05:41.000
Now that's bounce.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.291
That's trounce.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.458
Would you have to trounce him

05:50.458 --> 05:53.458
if he weren't wearing
the sheriff badge?

05:53.458 --> 05:54.875
Probably not.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.333
It's stuck.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.875
I guess it's sheriff
trouncing time.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.458
I don't suppose
you'd be satisfied

06:08.458 --> 06:11.333
with a hug instead?

06:11.333 --> 06:14.833
Mm, nah.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.416
Yaah!

06:29.875 --> 06:32.125
Hmph. Doesn't like hugs, huh?

06:32.125 --> 06:34.625
Hmm. How nasty can you get?

06:34.625 --> 06:37.083
Well, I say
we stand and fight.

06:37.083 --> 06:40.375
I can take this here villian
a thing or three. Why, I--

06:40.375 --> 06:43.500
to stand and fight,
you better stay in bed

06:43.500 --> 06:45.500
-

06:47.083 --> 06:50.125
Uh, p-perhaps we should
try to hide. Uh--

06:50.125 --> 06:53.000
to hide, but remember
what we said

06:53.000 --> 06:54.708
-

06:56.375 --> 06:58.708
Run! Run! We got to run!

06:58.708 --> 07:01.000
may think that you can run,
but Jack's a thoroughbred

07:01.000 --> 07:02.583
-

07:03.750 --> 07:05.333
Aah!

07:05.333 --> 07:06.958
What's the matter
with him?

07:06.958 --> 07:08.708
Hoo, well,

07:08.708 --> 07:12.375
obviously doesn't
appreciate fine music.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.000
Aah!

07:21.583 --> 07:23.750
So, buckaroo,

07:23.750 --> 07:27.291
might you be the proprietor
of this establishment?

07:27.291 --> 07:30.583
Estab-- Estab--
No, no, no, no.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.750
Then you must be a friend
of the sheriff.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.583
And since I hate sheriffs--

07:38.958 --> 07:42.166
Okey-dokey, boys,
what'll it be?

07:42.166 --> 07:47.250
Root beers and banana
splits all around. Pronto!

08:01.458 --> 08:04.458
What? No cherry?

08:04.458 --> 08:08.125
Uh, let me answer that
by saying...

08:08.125 --> 08:09.958
help!

08:09.958 --> 08:12.458
- Rabbit's in trouble.
- Rabbit: Oh, please!

08:12.458 --> 08:14.125
Oh, what should we
do, Pooh?

08:14.125 --> 08:16.375
- You're sheriff, Piglet.

08:16.375 --> 08:18.750
You have to give us
orders.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.125
Rabbit: Be reasonable!

08:20.125 --> 08:21.708
Well, then I order you
to think of something.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.125
Uh, p-p-please.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.958
Think, think. Think.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.208
Tigger: I got it!

08:26.208 --> 08:27.458
I'll go in the front door

08:27.458 --> 08:28.708
and keep him occupied

08:28.708 --> 08:30.458
while you two go
in the back door

08:30.458 --> 08:32.291
and rescue old long ears.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.458
- What'll I do?
- Rabbit: Not
the whipped cream!

08:34.458 --> 08:35.875
Uh, oh, uh, ha ha ha ha,

08:35.875 --> 08:38.250
you stay here
looking sheriffy,

08:38.250 --> 08:40.166
and, uh, uh,
when we're all set,

08:40.166 --> 08:41.875
you give the signal to go.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.458
I'll try.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.583
Go? Uh...

08:45.583 --> 08:48.250
Go? Go?

08:48.250 --> 08:50.208
Uh, go.

08:50.208 --> 08:54.708
Now that's how you
make a banana split.

08:57.875 --> 09:01.250
Piglet: Ready? Uh, g-go.

09:01.250 --> 09:04.708
Ki-yi-yippee-whoopee-yay!
Ha ha ha ha!

09:04.708 --> 09:08.458
I'm gonna rope you, sonny,
if you don't drop that bunny.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.416
Whatever you say.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.208
Thank you.

09:16.583 --> 09:19.500
Isn't this
working out nicely?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.416
No, not really.

09:21.416 --> 09:24.500
We're not going to
enjoy this, are we?

09:26.208 --> 09:27.958
Pooh: Pardon. Excuse us.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.875
Uh, pardon.

09:29.875 --> 09:31.708
Well, that didn't work.

09:31.708 --> 09:34.416
Okay, hang on to your
horse feathers.

09:34.416 --> 09:36.958
Now you're really
going to see something.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.875
Ha!

09:40.875 --> 09:42.083
Ha ha!

09:43.125 --> 09:44.458
Ha ha ha ha!

09:45.458 --> 09:46.708
Ha ha ha!

09:48.458 --> 09:50.375
Ha yourself.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.000
Ready?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.708
Pull. Pull.

09:54.708 --> 09:55.875
Pull!

09:57.583 --> 09:59.958
Thanks for uncorking me,

09:59.958 --> 10:02.291
though I kind of
liked it in there.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.750
Help! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

10:03.750 --> 10:05.708
Will you stop it!
Let go of me!

10:05.708 --> 10:06.958
Hey, that's my tail.

10:06.958 --> 10:09.416
Oh, no! Come on!
Help me!

10:09.416 --> 10:12.250
This is t-t-terrible.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.958
Could be worse.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.125
Yee!

10:15.125 --> 10:16.291
See?

10:16.291 --> 10:17.750
Jack: Hey, boys,

10:17.750 --> 10:20.125
look who just dropped in.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.708
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Oh, d-d-dear.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.708
Got any 3s?

10:38.875 --> 10:41.125
Go fish.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.291
What?

10:44.750 --> 10:49.333
Hey, sheriff,
it's trouncing time.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.125
Freeze,

10:51.125 --> 10:52.750
if you please.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.458
Aha!

10:58.458 --> 11:01.000
What are you?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I am the Masked Bear,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.500
and this is my faithful steed.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.833
Hello.

11:07.833 --> 11:12.250
You are gonna
try and stop me?

11:12.250 --> 11:14.833
What you got in there
for brains?

11:14.833 --> 11:16.500
Stuffing, actually.

11:18.875 --> 11:21.750
You better reach
for it, fur face.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.125
I got me a carton
of ice cream,

11:24.125 --> 11:26.750
and I'm not afraid to use it.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.250
Whoops.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.875
who wears the mask

11:44.875 --> 11:47.000
from any task

11:47.000 --> 11:50.250
faithful steed

11:53.708 --> 11:55.416
Hey, watch who you're
shoving, Johnny.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.000
I say, how rude.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.875
He battles on to victory!

11:58.875 --> 12:01.458
a clever plan

12:03.083 --> 12:05.375
the wild frontier

12:07.125 --> 12:10.000
Oh, bother.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.083
to buck him up

12:22.083 --> 12:23.708
Now I got you.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.458
Oh...

12:32.458 --> 12:33.958
Yaah!

12:42.250 --> 12:44.583
Ooh!

12:44.583 --> 12:46.708
Go on. G-Go on, shoo.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.708
Ha ha ha! Now that's
what I call sheriffing.

12:53.708 --> 12:57.083
Aw, I couldn't have done it
without the Masked Bear

12:57.083 --> 12:59.750
and his faithful,
uh, steed?

12:59.750 --> 13:02.625
Why, they're-- they're gone.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.958
Ooh, who was
that masked bear?

13:04.958 --> 13:06.875
Hi-yo, Eeyore!

13:06.875 --> 13:09.416
Away!

13:09.416 --> 13:11.000
Oh, bother.

13:13.083 --> 13:17.875
I'm gonna have to do something
about that Masked Bear.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.583
Pooh, what are you doing?

13:25.583 --> 13:27.750
According to the play,

13:27.750 --> 13:31.583
it is the job of the sheriff
to clean up the town.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.958
We're helping.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.875
Yucch. Pooey.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.750
I'll bet that Masked Bear
and his faithful steed

13:38.750 --> 13:41.000
ain't sweeping no sidewalks.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.833
I'm not so sure.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.458
You know, once you
get used to it,

13:46.458 --> 13:48.833
this sheriff job
isn't all that hard.

13:48.833 --> 13:53.000
Sure, as long as
the Masked Bear
is around.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.208
Ah. The Masked Bear.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.125
Telegram
for the Masked Bear.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.000
Telegram
for the Masked Bear.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.166
The Masked Bear, uh,

14:05.166 --> 14:07.375
isn't present presently.

14:07.375 --> 14:11.333
But we'll be happy
to tell him when we see him.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.958
Okey-dokey.

14:12.958 --> 14:17.458
It says "Help!"

14:22.333 --> 14:24.833
Hmm. Some sheriff.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.000
Oh, I'd better get him out.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I believe this is a job

14:30.000 --> 14:32.250
for the Masked Bear

14:32.250 --> 14:34.333
and his faithful steed.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.708
If you say so.

14:36.708 --> 14:40.000
Which, um, reminds me,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.583
Eeyore and I
have to go, uh...

14:43.583 --> 14:45.375
find some honey.

14:45.375 --> 14:50.000
Odd. How can you think of
food at a time like this?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.708
I practice.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.416
Aha!

15:05.416 --> 15:08.125
Aha yourself!

15:12.250 --> 15:15.583
Come on, Piglet,
this is embarrassing.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.083
Yaah!

15:18.125 --> 15:19.875
See? Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

15:19.875 --> 15:22.000
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.166
Rabbit: Ow!

15:23.166 --> 15:24.625
What was that?

15:24.625 --> 15:26.125
It's for you.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.875
Hmm. There's a note.

15:29.416 --> 15:31.750
Oh, well, it says, uh--

15:31.750 --> 15:34.875
It's easy. It says--
Anybody could-- Ha ha!

15:36.875 --> 15:39.583
Christopher Robin!

15:39.583 --> 15:40.625
Yes?

15:40.625 --> 15:42.708
Uh, w-would you
read this to us?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.458
It's to Piglet,

15:44.458 --> 15:48.458
- and it says "Dear Sheriff"--
- Owl, Gopher: Sheriff.

15:48.458 --> 15:52.583
at sundown

15:54.125 --> 16:00.000
have a showdown

16:00.000 --> 16:01.333
Gopher:
The Masked Bear--

16:01.333 --> 16:02.750
And his faithful steed.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.875
and can't be freed

16:04.875 --> 16:07.958
to meet your fate

16:07.958 --> 16:10.416
Sincerely, Jack.

16:10.416 --> 16:12.458
And don't be late!

16:12.458 --> 16:14.000
I just remembered.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.750
I have a very
important appointment--

16:15.750 --> 16:17.875
ha ha-- under my bed.

16:17.875 --> 16:21.500
But, Pigalet, you have
to go face Nasty Jack.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.208
Why?

16:23.208 --> 16:26.000
Because the townfolks
are depending on you.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.375
Waah!

16:27.375 --> 16:29.000
Oh, come on, old Piglet,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.583
old partner, old buddy.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.625
This showdown
won't be so bad.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.625
Wouldn't be so bad?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.625
His name is Nasty Jack,

16:36.625 --> 16:40.166
not Friendly Jack
or Perfectly Wonderful Jack.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.583
No. It's Nasty Jack.

16:42.583 --> 16:45.416
I'm not going
out there alone.

16:45.416 --> 16:48.416
But, Piglet,
what about the play?

16:48.416 --> 16:50.875
Uh, is there
anything in the play

16:50.875 --> 16:53.083
about the Masked Bear
saving me in the end?

16:53.083 --> 16:56.875
As a matter
of fact, there is.

16:56.875 --> 17:01.208
Well, if you're sure, okay.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.833
Ha ha ha ha!
What did I tell you?

17:12.833 --> 17:15.416
You look like
a million buckaroos.

17:15.416 --> 17:19.000
Now you can really
stand up for yourself.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.708
Not necessarily.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.583
Well?

17:29.708 --> 17:31.458
Mr. Nasty Jack, sir,

17:31.458 --> 17:33.416
as Sheriff of Rickety Gulch,

17:33.416 --> 17:36.416
I place you under arrest,
if you don't mind.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.875
Seems there ain't nobody here

17:44.875 --> 17:47.708
thinks you can
do that, Sheriff.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.708
I can, too. Besides,
the Masked Bear will s--

17:50.708 --> 17:53.291
-- will
save me in the end.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.583
Hooray!

17:56.583 --> 17:58.083
Yipe!

17:58.083 --> 18:00.583
Waiting for
the Masked Bear, huh?

18:03.958 --> 18:06.375
Sing it, boys.

18:06.375 --> 18:07.958
hands are tied

18:07.958 --> 18:09.625
to say goodbye

18:09.625 --> 18:11.583
he's with Nasty Jack

18:11.583 --> 18:13.083
coming back

18:13.083 --> 18:14.875
that he'll ever do

18:14.875 --> 18:16.833
became of Pooh

18:16.833 --> 18:18.625
Excuse me, but--

18:18.625 --> 18:21.500
Oh, ha ha ha!
A music lover.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.708
Any last requests?

18:23.708 --> 18:27.458
Just one. Do you know
how to untie us?

18:27.458 --> 18:30.000
No, but if you
hum a few bars,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.583
we'll try to fake it.

18:32.833 --> 18:36.000
Nothing's going
to stop us now.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.958
We're coming, Piglet!

18:40.291 --> 18:43.000
I really hope the Masked
Bear gets here soon.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.833
Ohh, bother!

18:46.833 --> 18:50.000
Better make
your move, Sheriff.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Whoa!

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Hmm. Not a bad move.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.125
I really, really hope

18:57.125 --> 18:59.083
the Masked Bear
gets here soon.

19:03.708 --> 19:07.291
with his faithful steed

19:10.375 --> 19:12.375
they're on their way

19:16.875 --> 19:18.833
in the nick of time

19:23.708 --> 19:27.375
for some surprise

19:27.375 --> 19:28.958
Gopher: Oops.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.625
Looks like they missed.

19:31.625 --> 19:32.708
What?

19:32.708 --> 19:34.708
That's not in the play.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.375
Here we go again.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.750
Them's the breaks,
binky.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.000
Looks like you're
all out of help.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.833
No Masked Bear,
no friends, no nothing.

19:49.833 --> 19:53.708
It's just you and me.

19:53.708 --> 19:56.166
Uh, maybe,
Mr. Nasty Jack,

19:56.166 --> 19:57.708
But even though
I didn't want to be,

19:57.708 --> 19:58.875
I'm sheriff,

19:58.875 --> 20:01.208
and a sheriff has
to protect people

20:01.208 --> 20:02.375
and be polite

20:02.375 --> 20:04.208
and-- and clean up
the town

20:04.208 --> 20:06.333
and, uh, and stop bad guys

20:06.333 --> 20:08.000
from doing no-gooding
around here

20:08.000 --> 20:09.875
and, uh, so there.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.000
You done?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.958
Yes.

20:18.958 --> 20:22.208
Then it's definitely
trouncing time.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.583
Ooh!

20:24.875 --> 20:27.458
Now look what you done!

20:27.458 --> 20:29.208
The badge fell off!

20:29.208 --> 20:30.750
You know what this means?

20:30.750 --> 20:32.583
I'm not sheriff anymore?

20:32.583 --> 20:35.000
You're not sheriff anymore!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.500
So I can go now?

20:36.500 --> 20:38.250
Aw, sure, fine.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.083
That's just peachy,
isn't it?

20:40.083 --> 20:42.250
Now I can't
even trounce you!

20:42.250 --> 20:45.958
What in the blue blazes
am I supposed to do?

20:48.875 --> 20:51.875
Maybe, uh, you
c-could be the sheriff?

20:51.875 --> 20:55.291
Honest? You mean it?

20:55.291 --> 20:57.958
I always wanted
to be sheriff.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.708
All rightie, pilgrim,

21:02.708 --> 21:05.125
I'm the sheriff now,

21:05.125 --> 21:09.000
and I'm really gonna
clean up this town.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.083
Comprendo?

21:18.250 --> 21:20.333
And to show our appreciation,

21:20.333 --> 21:22.291
we hereby present you

21:22.291 --> 21:26.250
with a Rickety Gulch
genuine hero award. Yep.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.166
All: Hooray!

21:29.166 --> 21:30.958
Hi-yo, Eeyore!

21:30.958 --> 21:33.083
Away!

21:34.166 --> 21:35.458
Oh, bother.

21:35.458 --> 21:38.833
What's the rush?
The play's over.

21:38.833 --> 21:41.208
Besides,
we're probably headed

21:41.208 --> 21:43.583
in the wrong direction.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.875
has been told

21:45.875 --> 21:49.458
brave and bold

21:49.458 --> 21:51.583
But another story
comes to mind,

21:51.583 --> 21:53.958
and I do believe
we still have time.

21:53.958 --> 21:56.125
It's all about a gopher
and an owl.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.333
Owl: Ooh. Well, I say.
