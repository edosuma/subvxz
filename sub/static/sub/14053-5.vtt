Yeah! Oh, mint, man! That's a top chord!

00:46.640 --> 00:49.600
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! -CHERYL: Oh, dear! Oh...

00:49.640 --> 00:52.560
Well, I mean, a few small tweaks aside, we're done!

00:52.600 --> 00:54.720
-PETE: Great! Sweet!

00:54.760 --> 00:56.880
Okay, so, I know it's been a long journey...

00:56.920 --> 00:59.520
Tell me about it! Two planes, a boat.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.320
Ah, she didn't mean to the island, you...

01:01.360 --> 01:03.480
But... But this album...

01:03.520 --> 01:06.200
This album makes it all worthwhile.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.840
It has "hit" written all over it.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.200
What I said! Party, man!

01:09.240 --> 01:11.760
Yeah, we are going to break America.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.960
Speaking as someone who lives there,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.360
I think you'll find America's already broken.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.400
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for my dip.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.520
Vince, you happy with the drums on that?

01:25.560 --> 01:27.520
Well, er...

01:27.560 --> 01:30.760
Why don't you ask the drummer if he was happy

01:27.560 --> 01:30.760
with the drums?

01:32.440 --> 01:33.480
Well, were you?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.480
Yes. Well, I was.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.400
Laters.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.120
Stevie?

01:43.160 --> 01:44.200
Is everything all right?

01:44.240 --> 01:46.560
Yeah, I'm all right. Why wouldn't I be?

01:46.600 --> 01:49.280
Oh, I don't know, I was just wondering...

01:49.320 --> 01:51.920
Cheryl, I haven't changed my mind.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.680
You're gonna have to accept that.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.000
-Of course, yeah. -Yeah, right.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.560
We can have another pass if you want.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.480
Yeah, I'll do a pick-up on the bass as well.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.720
Hey! I'm the bass player.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.440
Yeah, course you are, mate. Course you are.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.280
And what's that supposed to mean?

02:07.320 --> 02:10.160
You never wondered why it sounded better

02:07.320 --> 02:10.160
on record than it did live?

02:10.200 --> 02:12.080
Hey, Stevie redid all your drums...

02:12.120 --> 02:15.160
He did all your bass because you play like you're

02:12.120 --> 02:15.160
wearing a boxing glove!

02:16.320 --> 02:18.400
All right, all right, all right!

02:18.440 --> 02:20.120
If Stevie redid both your parts,

02:20.160 --> 02:22.240
it's not each other you should be having a go at.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.360
Is it?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.560


02:25.600 --> 02:27.920
JIM: Fair enough. DISCO: Yeah, whatever.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.760
VINCE: That's sounding great.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.840
I'll keep the tape running, if you're happy to carry on.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.000
There you go.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.600
Signed, sealed and delivered.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.040
Thanks, Pete.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.320
Pete, what was the name of that bar we were in

03:01.440 --> 03:04.320
on Sunday night?

03:05.080 --> 03:06.160
The Bullet Bar.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.440
That's the one.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.760
DISCO: Oi, oi, oi! JIM: Oh, come on!

03:13.800 --> 03:15.160
DISCO: What's going on?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.600
VINCE: I'll check the fuse box.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.200
PETE: Well, it's not going to be the fuse box, is it?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.880
It'll be another bloody power cut.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.840
JIM: Right, I'm going for the fagarettes.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.560
PETE: Bloody Caribbean.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.200
Can't wait to get back home.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.360
What, to the wind and the rain? Nutter!

03:32.400 --> 03:35.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, working electricity

03:32.400 --> 03:35.720
and sanity.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.920
What?

03:41.480 --> 03:42.560
Stevie!

03:43.600 --> 03:44.840
No!

03:44.880 --> 03:46.520
The electricity's live!

04:24.040 --> 04:25.440
Good afternoon, sir.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.520
Er, sorry, nobody's in the station,

04:27.560 --> 04:29.520
so I thought I'd make myself useful out here.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.720
Watering the flowers.

04:30.760 --> 04:31.760
They looked a bit dry.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.880
JP.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.360
JP, yes, of course, of course.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.800
It's today, is it?

04:36.840 --> 04:38.600
Yeah, well, of course it's today.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.600
Yeah, um, sorry.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.440
Er, we were up late, er, solving a case last night,

04:38.640 --> 04:42.440
and, uh... And...

04:45.480 --> 04:47.040
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.440
-Little bit wet. -Yes.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.480
-I'm so sorry about that, sir. -Don't worry.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.800
Don't worry about it, JP. It's just a wet shoe.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.600
No, I'll find... Yes, no, no, no.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.600
I've got that, sir.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.440
I just need to get my shoe off.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.880
And I will be fine.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.440
Get it dry, I can do that. I can do it, thank you.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.280
-Give me your socks. -No, I will deal

05:00.480 --> 05:02.280
with my socks.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.880
-Honestly, no, you're tickling my foot!

05:02.320 --> 05:04.880
-The water, it's everywhere.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.320
Good afternoon, sir.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.760
-You must be JP. -Oh, yes, of course.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.760
You two have not met. Er, allow me to introduce you

05:14.800 --> 05:17.160
to, er, PC Hooper.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.760
Um, this is the bit where people

05:20.960 --> 05:24.760
usually say hello.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.800
-Oh, yes, er, hello. -Hello.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.880
Er, PC Hooper, this is, er, Sergeant...

05:29.920 --> 05:32.120
Sorry, Detective Sergeant Cassell.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.160
Yes, well, it's a new day for all of us, isn't it?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.920
You a PC, you a DS.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.760
Yes, well, I've got a new pen... Somewhere.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.640
CASSELL: Honore Police Station?

05:44.680 --> 05:46.240
I should have answered the phone, shouldn't I?

05:46.280 --> 05:48.200
Oh, don't worry about it, JP.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.680
I'm sure we'll find plenty of things for you to do,

05:48.240 --> 05:50.680
other than watering flowers.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.560
That was Dwayne.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.160
We have a death at the Scorpion Lounge

05:53.600 --> 05:56.160
recording studio.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.000
Gosh. Right, well, we'd better get down there.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.880
Er, after you, JP. We'll see you down there.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.520
I'm really sorry, sir.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
Er, Florence?

06:05.480 --> 06:06.880
Yes?

06:06.920 --> 06:10.800
Er, I think it'll take us a while to find our rhythm.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.440
As it were, erm,

06:12.480 --> 06:14.680
but, er, what I'd like to say is that

06:14.720 --> 06:16.440
if you'll agree to be patient with me,

06:16.480 --> 06:19.960
er, then I will agree to try and not be too much...

06:20.000 --> 06:21.840
Er, well, yeah, well, like myself, really.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.200
You know what I think?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.440
I think we should not worry about it.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.240
Just focus on the case and see how we go.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.280
I say, that sounds like a splendid idea.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.360
Uh, shall we?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.120
Yeah.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.920
I can't believe I'll be working with

06:36.840 --> 06:39.920
the legendary Dwayne Myers.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.480
I've heard so much about you at police college.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.680
Why wouldn't it be?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.960
Never mind.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.040
Chief?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.920
So, what have we got so far?

06:51.960 --> 06:54.280
A band from the UK, here to record an album.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.840
-Um...

06:56.880 --> 06:59.960
If you have to look it up, it's clearly no-one

06:56.880 --> 06:59.960
we'll have heard of.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.880
Yes, well, I may have.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.200
You don't seem the type to have your finger on

07:01.920 --> 07:04.200
the pulse of popular music.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.320
Especially Flowers Of Progress.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.560
-Never heard of them. -Me neither.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.440
-Er, no, sir.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.560
Flowers Of Progress?

07:13.920 --> 07:16.680
Flowers Of Progress are here on Saint

07:23.600 --> 07:24.800
Stevie Smith,

07:24.840 --> 07:27.560
habitual wild child and lead singer.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.280
Lived life on the edge.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.360
And died the ultimate rock 'n' roll death,

07:31.400 --> 07:33.520
electrocuted in the swimming pool.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.480
Okay, <i> merci.</i>

07:41.200 --> 07:43.840
So, whereabouts in the pool was the body discovered,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.840
Dwayne?

07:43.880 --> 07:47.320
Well, he was found floating just there, Chief.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.840
FLORENCE: If he was this end of the pool,

07:48.880 --> 07:50.640
he can't have knocked the lights in, himself.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.800
But why were the lights left on in the daylight?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.680
They weren't, but the power supply

07:52.840 --> 07:55.680
to them was.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.480
This was all set for tonight.

07:58.520 --> 08:03.200
An end-of-recording party, to thank local musicians,

07:58.520 --> 08:03.200
hotel employees,

08:03.240 --> 08:04.480
people like that, you know?

08:04.520 --> 08:06.480
All organised by the band's manager.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.760
So, the question is, how did the stage lights

08:06.520 --> 08:09.760
end up in the swimming pool?

08:09.800 --> 08:11.200
I think I can help you with that one, Chief.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.560
You see...

08:13.600 --> 08:16.760
-Pin needs to be in, to keep the leg in position.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.760
-Mmm-hmm.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.120
But look here, it's worn and weathered.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.960
I think the pin snapped and the whole thing fell

08:19.160 --> 08:21.960
into the swimming pool.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.160
-Here it is.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.480
No, don't touch it.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.400
Right.  I need a...

08:28.440 --> 08:30.080
Ah, yeah. Thank you, Florence.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.000
If you ask me, Chief,

08:34.040 --> 08:36.640
the poor guy just took his swim

08:34.040 --> 08:36.640
at precisely the wrong time.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.040
Yes, it does seem incredibly unfortunate,

08:36.680 --> 08:39.040
doesn't it?

08:39.080 --> 08:41.000
You don't think it was an accident?

08:41.040 --> 08:43.640
This pin didn't break, not of its own accord.

08:43.680 --> 08:44.960
It's been deliberately cut.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.320
Really?

08:46.360 --> 08:49.240
With some sort of hacksaw, as far as I can tell.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.880
Yes, look, the blade slipped, marking it there.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.440
And the end has burrs, it's not been

08:51.920 --> 08:54.440
sheared off clean. If this was a pin that

08:54.480 --> 08:57.000
just snapped after years of wear and tear,

08:57.040 --> 08:58.760
the break would be smooth, but this isn't.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.720
It was deliberately sawn in two.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.040
So, what, you think someone pushed

09:00.760 --> 09:04.040
the tripod into the pool,

09:04.080 --> 09:05.600
intending to kill Stevie?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.720
And then cut the pin to make it look like

09:05.640 --> 09:07.720
an accident. Yes.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.920
So it was a murder?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.320
I'd say so, JP. I need a bag. Er...

09:11.760 --> 09:13.320
Ah, thank you.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.080
Ah.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.400
That's funny. <i>Elateridae</i> family,

09:26.240 --> 09:28.320
more commonly known as the click beetle.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.960
A click beetle?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.400
Yes, so named because if they happen to find

09:30.000 --> 09:32.400
themselves upside down,

09:32.440 --> 09:34.680
then they can click their backs to throw

09:32.440 --> 09:34.680
themselves in the air

09:34.720 --> 09:36.920
and land the right way round. Amazing little things.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.720
-Yes.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.960
Yes, well, the thing is, this specific breed

09:41.400 --> 09:43.960
of click beetle,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.960
<i>Achrestus fortunei,</i> has never lived

09:44.000 --> 09:46.960
on Saint-Marie.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.560
They're endemic only to Martinique.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.440
So, how did it get here?

09:51.480 --> 09:53.280
Quite. How indeed?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.720
Dust for prints, photograph and bag anything of interest.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.480
-Sarge. -Thanks.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.720
-He is amazing.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.720
I mean, that was just amazing.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.800
He's got a lot better tricks up his sleeve.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.800
Just wait and see.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.160
This was your first album?

10:12.200 --> 10:13.640
PETE: It was our only album.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.960
-Yes, um...

10:18.200 --> 10:21.360
Stevie's death may not have been an accident.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
You what

10:23.440 --> 10:25.520
Razor-sharp as ever there, Jimbo.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.000
We're not ruling anything out at the moment.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.800
Who discovered Stevie's body?

10:29.840 --> 10:32.200
Ah, we did.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.240
-Pete Thunders. -Yes. Hey.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.680
And?

10:36.720 --> 10:40.880
And this is Jim Smith, bass player and

10:36.720 --> 10:40.880
was Stevie's brother.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.280
I'm sorry for your loss, Jim.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.960
What's your role in the band?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.480
I'm... I'm the guitarist.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.720
And vocalist, and, er, songwriter.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.680
Co-writer.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.920
Yeah, co-songwriter.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
-Er, Disco Biscuit,

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
the drummer.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.640
Or, as most people know me these days,

11:00.680 --> 11:01.680
Duncan Roberts.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.200
And you are?

11:05.800 --> 11:07.720
Hello?

11:07.760 --> 11:10.640
Erm... Oh, Cheryl. Er, Cheryl Moore.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.880
I'm the band's manager.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.600
Oh, yes, you organised the party?

11:13.640 --> 11:14.760
That's right. That was all me.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.760
Okay, not all me.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.200
Um, the beer company was footing the bill.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.840
But, er, yes.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.400
-Vince, the producer.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.000
This is my place.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.480
Yeah. What time did you find Stevie?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.000
VINCE: After 12:00.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.640
That's when the power tripped out.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.920
Thank you.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.200
And when did you last see Stevie alive?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.600
When he left the studio to go for a swim.

11:37.640 --> 11:38.720
HUMPHREY: Regular thing, was it?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.920
He liked to be in the pool at 12:00.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.320
Mad dogs and Englishmen and all that, you know.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.400
Yes. And what time did he leave the studio?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.840
Some time round 11:00, 11:30?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.760
Yeah, around that time, yeah.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.880
I can find the exact time for you on the control desk,

11:50.800 --> 11:53.880
if you'd like.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.680
Er, and did any of you see Stevie alive

11:53.920 --> 11:57.680
after he left the studio?

11:57.720 --> 11:58.800
JIM: Hmm.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.760
Why did you decide to record here in Saint

12:03.800 --> 12:07.680
Um, yes, in, er... In 1991, The Flowers Of Progress

12:07.720 --> 12:09.000
recorded their first album in this very...

12:09.040 --> 12:10.440
Our only album.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.200
Yeah, in this very studio.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.600
So, we've returned to recapture

12:13.640 --> 12:16.000
the anarchic energy that fuelled that debut...

12:16.040 --> 12:19.240
No-one in Britain would have Stevie record in their studio.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.760
The band had... We'd just got back together...

12:20.800 --> 12:24.000
Yes, thanks to Grand Central Beer.

12:24.040 --> 12:27.440
There's a song on the first album called...

12:27.480 --> 12:29.600
<i>-Grand Central.</i> Track two. -Yes.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.920
Um, and a... A beer company in America

12:31.960 --> 12:33.800
with the same name heard the song

12:33.840 --> 12:35.520
and wanted to use it for a commercial.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.240
If the advert goes the way that we hope it will,

12:37.280 --> 12:40.160
then it could be a really great

12:37.280 --> 12:40.160
opportunity for the...

12:40.200 --> 12:41.320
This band.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.000
Where were you all at the time of Stevie's death,

12:46.200 --> 12:49.000
when the power tripped out?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.960
We were all in the studio.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.800
At 12:00, when the lights fell in the pool and

12:51.000 --> 12:54.800
Stevie was electrocuted,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.920
you were all there, all of you, inside the studio?

12:58.480 --> 12:59.680
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.480
-Mmm-hmm. -Yeah.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.080
HUMPHREY: Okay.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.360
So, all five people in there claim they were together

13:07.120 --> 13:10.360
in the studio

13:10.400 --> 13:13.560
when the lighting rig entered the pool

13:10.400 --> 13:13.560
and electrocuted Stevie.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.640
There's a security fence around the whole place.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.240
The only way to get out here is to come through the villa.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.120
Then someone who was allowed in.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.720
The band didn't set up all this.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.360
DWAYNE: I already checked.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.440
The catering company and the stage crew

13:23.400 --> 13:26.440
did it all last night.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.800
Everyone was signed in, then signed out,

13:28.840 --> 13:30.640
and no-one's visited since.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.440
Yes, well, best to check, anyway, just to be

13:30.680 --> 13:33.440
on the safe side.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.080
So, the killer's intention

13:35.120 --> 13:38.360
was for us to believe that a worn pin and

13:35.120 --> 13:38.360
a badly timed swim

13:38.400 --> 13:40.680
led to the unfortunate death of Stevie Smith.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.520
JP: And you don't believe it, Chief?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.320
No.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.520
I think our killer seized their moment

13:48.360 --> 13:51.520
when Stevie wasn't looking,

13:51.560 --> 13:53.160
pushed the lights into the pool,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.240
then covered their tracks by staging the scene,

13:55.280 --> 13:59.720
to make the whole thing look like it was

13:55.280 --> 13:59.720
an unfortunate accident.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.120
But, sir, if the only five people who

13:59.760 --> 14:02.120
could have done it

14:02.160 --> 14:03.480
were in the studio

14:03.520 --> 14:05.840
at the time that it happened,

14:05.880 --> 14:07.680
well, how would they have managed that?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.960
That, JP, is the question, and at the moment,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.760
I don't have the faintest idea.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.760
So, first of all, the hotel where the band are staying.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.440
Er, I want you to go into Stevie's room

14:16.480 --> 14:17.880
and see if there's anything of interest.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.200
Um, er...

14:24.480 --> 14:27.960
Right. Florence, let's see how Vince is getting on

14:24.480 --> 14:27.960
with our time line.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.680
Mind your head, sir!

14:29.720 --> 14:31.800
<i>♪ ...bullet</i>

14:31.840 --> 14:35.960
<i>♪ Boo-na-na</i> <i>Boo-na-na-boo-bullet</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:37.080
<i>♪ A bullet ♪</i>

14:39.440 --> 14:40.880
Sorry to disturb you.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.480
We were just listening to the tape.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.160
Ahem. Er, could we have a quick word, Vince?

14:48.200 --> 14:49.320
Yeah.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.760
In private.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.200
Oh. Of course.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.240
Yes, course.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.480
Right, well, er, if you'll... I'll just... I can wait out...

14:59.520 --> 15:01.280
Er, no. Er, probably best if I...

15:01.320 --> 15:03.400
I'll go back to the hotel.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.240
Thank you.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.640
Not the most organised manager I've ever worked with.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.280
Do you know her well?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.240
She pretty much keeps herself to herself.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.440
Yeah.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.480
Yeah, and the band? Um...

15:20.280 --> 15:22.080
-No.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.720
I produced their first album back in the day

15:25.760 --> 15:29.280
and I've just done their... Well, their last album, so...

15:29.320 --> 15:30.640
Do they work together well?

15:30.680 --> 15:33.600
The first week or so, it was a bit patchy.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.680
But this last week, things have really

15:33.640 --> 15:36.680
come together.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.800
Stevie was excited, reenergised.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.960
So, yeah, I guess so.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.440
Er, did you find out when Stevie left for his swim?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.440
It was about here.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.840
STEVIE: <i> Were you, er...</i> <i>Were you happy</i>

15:49.480 --> 15:51.840
<i>with the drums on that?</i>

15:51.880 --> 15:53.760
-DISCO: <i> Why don't</i>

15:51.880 --> 15:53.760
<i>you ask the drummer</i>

15:53.800 --> 15:55.200
<i>if he was happy</i> <i>with the drums?</i>

15:55.240 --> 15:57.880
STEVIE: <i> Well, were you?</i> DISCO: <i> Yes.</i>

15:57.920 --> 15:59.600
DISCO: <i> Well, I was.</i> STEVIE: <i> Laters.</i>

16:00.480 --> 16:05.640
And that was about 11:28.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.360
11:28? Er, could you just play us a little more,

16:08.400 --> 16:10.280
just before the power cut out?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.000
VINCE: <i> That's sounding great.</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:16.320
<i>I'll keep the tape running,</i> <i>if you're happy to carry on.</i>

16:16.360 --> 16:18.960
-That's Disco Biscuit. -Ah.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.200
PETE: <i> Signed, sealed</i> <i>and delivered.</i>

16:22.240 --> 16:23.440
CHERYL: <i> Thanks, Pete.</i>

16:23.480 --> 16:24.640
JIM: <i> Pete, what was</i> <i>the name of that bar</i>

16:24.680 --> 16:26.120
<i>we were in on Sunday night?</i>

16:26.160 --> 16:28.040
PETE: <i> The Bullet Bar.</i> JIM: <i> That's the one.</i>

16:28.080 --> 16:30.760
-And that was the end

16:28.080 --> 16:30.760
of the session,

16:30.800 --> 16:32.000
when the power went.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.880
Right, and that's everyone's voices we heard?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.720
Er, yourself, Jim, Cheryl...

16:35.760 --> 16:38.160
Yeah, all of us. We were all there.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.320
-Yeah, sure.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.760
Thank you, Vince.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.320
Right.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.240
Looking through a rock star's room.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.760
I'm not so sure about that.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.760
If this guy's the hell-raiser everyone says he is,

16:59.800 --> 17:01.960
we could have quite a heavy task

16:59.800 --> 17:01.960
on our hands.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
-I suppose so. -Hey, this is the one.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.480
What the...

17:15.480 --> 17:16.720
Wow.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.280
It's really

17:20.320 --> 17:22.520
tidy.

17:22.560 --> 17:27.080
Okay, so, we look for anything out of the ordinary.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.040
Itemise and bag whatever we find.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.680
Absolutely.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.440
Right, I'll leave this with you.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.400
-Oh. -I'll see you in

17:32.480 --> 17:34.400
about an hour, okay?

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
Aren't we supposed to do this together?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.000
Yes, but while you're in here,

17:38.040 --> 17:39.720
I'm going to go and see the hotel manager

17:39.760 --> 17:42.120
and see if she knows anything.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.600
Look, I'm more than happy to swap with you, you know.

17:45.640 --> 17:50.200
But it's the hotel manager. She goes on and on and on.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.840
I wouldn't want you to have to go through that.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.760
No, sir! Not on your first day.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.520
Thank you. You're welcome.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.840
Dwayne Myers.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.440
Okay. Let's do this.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.560
So, I tried to find anything from when the band

18:10.480 --> 18:13.560
were here last.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.720
So, <i> The Saint Marie Times</i> are doing a search through

18:13.600 --> 18:16.720
their clippings archive

18:16.760 --> 18:18.360
and will send over anything of interest.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.000
Brilliant. So, suspects?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.120
Pete Thunders.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.400
After the band split, he became an artist.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.520
Having done initial financial checks,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.440
hasn't been very successful.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.720
He has a few cautions on his file, all for assault.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.480
Prone to violence

18:33.520 --> 18:35.400
He retired from music, invested in property

18:35.440 --> 18:37.920
and he's now a millionaire several times over.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.080
So, he's not in this for the money.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.440
Next, Jim Smith.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.240
Had a tempestuous relationship with his brother.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.560
Long history of their bust-ups.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.520
Insisting on separate hotels when touring.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.600
-Usual rock-star stuff.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.360
Er, an e-mail from <i>The Saint Marie Times.</i>

18:52.400 --> 18:54.160
-An attachment.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.400
I'll print it off.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.160
Just leaves us with Cheryl and Vince.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.720
I couldn't find a great deal online about Cheryl.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.960
But, considering she knew Stevie the least,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.880
well, she appeared to be the most upset,

19:04.920 --> 19:06.000
so I'll keep looking.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.400
Vince?

19:07.440 --> 19:10.640
Producer and owner of the recording studio,

19:10.680 --> 19:12.880
originally built by his father in the '60s.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.320
The family business.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.920
Personal life a bit of a mess. Ex-wife lives in London.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.200
Which just leaves us with this little chap.

19:19.240 --> 19:23.320
Why was he found expired at our crime scene,

19:19.240 --> 19:23.320
rather than enjoying life

19:23.360 --> 19:26.880
amongst his fellow click beetles

19:23.360 --> 19:26.880
back on Martinique?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.520
You should see this.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.920
-It was Vince's studio. -HUMPHREY: Right.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.080
Beer's warm, the food's gone off

19:45.120 --> 19:46.880
and the ice has melted.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.080
What a party, eh?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.440
HUMPHREY: We were wondering if you

19:49.120 --> 19:51.440
had a minute, Mr Thuram.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.200
If that's all it is.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.560
The catering equipment's being flown back early.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.000
I need to get all this lot ready.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.200
HUMPHREY: Hopefully it won't take too long.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.520
Your studio burnt down.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.120
July '91.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.480
The Flowers Of Progress were recording here.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.920
Hmm. It wasn't the greatest of times.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.280
According to the reports, it was Stevie who caused it.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
He was at the height of his drinking.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.840
He was reckless. He wouldn't listen to anyone.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.920
He didn't care about anyone else.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.280
So, why did you let them back in?

20:32.320 --> 20:35.120
I didn't want to, believe me.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.320
But I'm not in a position to turn work down, so...

20:39.360 --> 20:41.040
This was your father's studio, wasn't it?

20:41.080 --> 20:42.960
Built it himself.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.160
Must have been particularly upsetting

20:44.200 --> 20:45.960
when the insurance didn't pay out.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.400
It's not been easy, I admit.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.400
But I got through it.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.680
It was three years after the fire

20:54.720 --> 20:56.600
until you were able to reopen the studio.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.400
That's a long time.

20:59.440 --> 21:04.800
Your wife left you during that period, didn't she,

20:59.440 --> 21:04.800
all because of Stevie?

21:04.840 --> 21:08.560
How did you feel, seeing him

21:04.840 --> 21:08.560
after all this time?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.960
Look, the guy's changed.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.200
He's dry now, doesn't touch a drop.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.080
I guess I felt I shouldn't hold it against him.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.440
He's grown up, I suppose.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.000
I'll get those CDs.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.320
Er...

21:43.360 --> 21:46.200
Um, okay, madam, thank you very much.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.560
You've been very helpful.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.960
Now, if you wouldn't mind excusing us, please.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.560
Look, I really wanted to come and help you

21:53.080 --> 21:55.560
with the search, you know.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.000
But I couldn't get away.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.560
That woman could talk a glass eye

21:57.040 --> 21:59.560
to sleep, you know.

21:59.600 --> 22:03.000
So, I itemised and bagged whatever I can find.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.480
Good.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.800
-Come now. -Dental floss.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.400
Small toothbrushes. Mouthwash. Teeth whitener.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.640
-JP... -Contact lenses.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.640
Contact lens solution.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.360
JP!

22:14.400 --> 22:17.360
-Yes, like you said.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.200
But this is just the bathroom, sir, so...

22:19.240 --> 22:21.600
Look, this is all very good and very thorough,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.280
but did you actually find anything relevant to the case?

22:25.720 --> 22:26.760
What?

22:27.560 --> 22:28.960
This.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.080
Stevie's browser history's particularly interesting.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.920
Oh!

22:34.960 --> 22:38.920
<i>-♪ Boo-na-na</i>

22:34.960 --> 22:38.920
<i>Boo-na-na-boo-bullet</i>

22:38.960 --> 22:40.560
<i>♪ Boo-na-na-boo... ♪</i>

22:45.400 --> 22:48.120
Well, er...

22:48.160 --> 22:51.960
The tapes confirm that the last time anyone

22:48.160 --> 22:51.960
is heard leaving the studio,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.040
apart from Stevie, is 10:00

22:54.080 --> 22:56.920
and that was Pete, two hours before our victim was killed.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.800
-No idea.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.400
But I did come across something of interest.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.680
Listen to this.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.400
-Er, this is from 10:00. -JIM: <i> Two! One, two!</i>

23:05.440 --> 23:07.000
JIM: <i> One, two, two...</i> STEVIE: <i> Three?</i>

23:07.040 --> 23:08.880
DISCO: <i> Oh, yeah,</i> <i>funny, Stevie.</i>

23:08.920 --> 23:10.080
VINCE: <i> Okay, rolling.</i>

23:10.120 --> 23:11.920
Jim, Stevie and Disco were in the studio

23:11.960 --> 23:13.080
and Pete and Cheryl

23:13.120 --> 23:15.040
were in the control room with Vince.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.240
CHERYL: <i> Pete, calm down.</i> <i>It's fine.</i>

23:17.280 --> 23:19.760
VINCE: <i> Where are you going?</i> PETE: <i> For a smoke!</i>

23:19.800 --> 23:22.480
<i>It's like Cardiff,</i> <i>all over again!</i>

23:22.520 --> 23:24.760
-Mmm-hmm.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.560
-He doesn't sound

23:24.800 --> 23:28.560
very happy, does he?

23:30.920 --> 23:32.560
The band split up in Cardiff.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.120
"September the 12th, 1992."

23:42.160 --> 23:44.120
So, were the band about to split again?

23:44.160 --> 23:46.480
And if so, why? I might be able

23:46.520 --> 23:48.840
to help you with that, Sarge.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.720
So, while JP was searching Stevie's room,

23:52.760 --> 23:55.240
I was hard at work interviewing the

23:52.760 --> 23:55.240
hotel manager.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.960
Now, a porter was sent to Stevie's room last night

23:57.000 --> 23:58.480
after complaints of a fight.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.120
-We don't know.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.320
The porter isn't on duty yet.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.840
They're going to let us know when he is.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.440
-Also, JP came across this. -Yes, er...

24:06.480 --> 24:09.040
It was uploaded last week by Stevie.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.680


24:10.720 --> 24:12.960
<i>I'm no sell-out,</i> <i>especially not that stuff.</i>

24:13.000 --> 24:14.720
<i>It's crap!</i> <i>If I fell off</i>

24:14.760 --> 24:16.480
<i>the wagon tomorrow,</i>

24:16.520 --> 24:20.120
<i>and Grand Central</i> <i>was the last beer left</i>

24:16.520 --> 24:20.120
<i>in the world,</i>

24:20.160 --> 24:22.360
<i>I still wouldn't touch it,</i> <i>you know what I mean?</i>

24:22.400 --> 24:24.320
Stevie put that up himself?

24:24.360 --> 24:25.760
Stevie may have been off the booze,

24:25.800 --> 24:27.520
but he clearly hadn't lost his rebellious streak.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.760
Grand Central is the company that wanted to use

24:29.800 --> 24:31.920
one of the band's songs in a commercial.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.400
A deal that would net the songwriters

24:31.960 --> 24:34.400
half a million dollars.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.000
Half a million dollars?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.840
We picked up the contract from the manager, Cheryl.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.320
FLORENCE: Who are the songwriters?

24:40.360 --> 24:42.080
Stevie and Pete?

24:42.120 --> 24:44.920
The inspector wins a cigar.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.800
There's a clause that states that the contract

24:44.960 --> 24:47.800
will be terminated

24:47.840 --> 24:51.080
if any of the band defames the product

24:47.840 --> 24:51.080
in print or online.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.840
And this clip is everywhere.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.960
So, Pete stands to lose his share

24:52.880 --> 24:55.960
of half a million dollars.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
All thanks to Stevie.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.920
You know, if memory serves, the band used to have

25:01.360 --> 25:04.920
some sort of a fanzine,

25:04.960 --> 25:08.240
<i>Packet Of Seeds</i> or <i> Bunch Of Flowers</i>

25:04.960 --> 25:08.240
or something like that.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.040
What?

25:12.080 --> 25:14.280
Do you think we should be honest with each other,

25:14.320 --> 25:16.360
now we're working a little closer?

25:16.400 --> 25:18.720
Yes, absolutely. What's on your mind?

25:18.760 --> 25:23.360
This band don't appear to be, as you say, your cup of tea?

25:23.400 --> 25:26.800
That's very perceptive of you, DS Cassell.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.160
Yes, well, I bought their album because...

25:28.200 --> 25:31.240
Well, er, someone persuaded me.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.280
-Angela Matterson.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.880
Angela Matterson?

25:34.920 --> 25:37.400
She was a very forceful girl, Miss Matterson.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.280
If she told you to buy a record,

25:37.440 --> 25:39.280
you bought that record.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.400
I studied that record.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.320
-Hated it.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.880
No, I... I like happy songs.

25:45.920 --> 25:46.920
I like a nice melody, you know?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.880
FLORENCE: We've looked at your financial records.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.960
Things haven't been easy.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.600
Look, I'm not going to pretend

26:03.640 --> 26:07.240
that a massive payday wasn't an incentive

26:03.640 --> 26:07.240
for the band to reform.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.040
-HUMPHREY: So, the band split up in...

26:07.280 --> 26:09.040
-'92.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.720
'92.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.600
We were doing a gig and there was this guy in

26:12.640 --> 26:16.640
who had this massive music show,

26:12.640 --> 26:16.640
and he wanted us on.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.240
We were going to sell a lot of records, you know?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.880
So, we're up there,

26:21.920 --> 26:24.600
Stevie's knocking back a bottle of whisky on stage,

26:24.640 --> 26:30.080
and halfway through the set he just starts

26:24.640 --> 26:30.080
gobbing off at him.

26:30.120 --> 26:33.440
I mean properly, telling him he's no sell-out.

26:33.480 --> 26:36.040
Well, we tried to smooth it over after the gig,

26:36.080 --> 26:37.400
but it was too late.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.640
He'd blown it for all of us.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.080
So, you decided to split up.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.320
And what? You reached that decision

26:44.840 --> 26:48.320
calmly, rationally?

26:48.360 --> 26:50.920
Me and Stevie had a little set-to,

26:48.360 --> 26:50.920
nothing too serious.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.400
Apart from you were cautioned for assault.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.720
Yeah, er, okay.

26:54.760 --> 26:58.280
But, look, that was just band stuff, you know?

26:58.320 --> 27:00.520
I've changed. We all have.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.600
And this... This is ancient history.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.360
But history does have a habit of repeating itself.

27:06.400 --> 27:11.160
See, we got hold of a contract between you,

27:06.400 --> 27:11.160
Stevie and Grand Central Beer.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.240
You and Stevie are to earn half a million dollars

27:14.280 --> 27:16.480
plus whatever doors the ad would open for you.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.400
But then Stevie bad-mouthed the beer.

27:19.440 --> 27:20.520
We've seen the clip.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.640
As has everyone at Grand Central Beer.

27:22.680 --> 27:26.640
Stevie destroyed your chances by opening his big mouth

27:22.680 --> 27:26.640
once again.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.680
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

27:28.720 --> 27:29.920
But no.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.800
The beer company love the clip.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.400
What?

27:38.760 --> 27:39.920
It's Dwayne.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.080
Ask Cheryl. Check with the company.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.960
Ask anyone. I thought, yes,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.480
him gobbing off had ruined it

27:44.000 --> 27:46.480
for all of us again.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.240
But she was on the phone to 'em this morning.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.320
They think it's hilarious.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.320
Proper rock 'n' roll.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.160
Pure Stevie. No such thing as bad press.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.240
You know what I mean? Go figure.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.120
Right.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.800
Er, well, thank you for your time, Mr Thunders.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.560
Right, we need to check with the beer company.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.680
But if Pete's telling the truth

28:09.720 --> 28:11.000
about their reaction to the footage,

28:11.040 --> 28:13.040
then we've just lost ourselves a motive.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.720
Then you'll be pleased to know we might have found

28:13.080 --> 28:16.720
another one.

28:16.760 --> 28:20.440
Dwayne heard from the hotel. The porter's arrived for work.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.280
We know who Stevie was arguing with in his bedroom.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.120
Who was it?

28:25.160 --> 28:27.400
Oh, yeah. Hang on.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.560
I do remember some little busybody porter

28:29.600 --> 28:30.880
banging on Stevie's door,

28:30.920 --> 28:32.920
mouthing off about summat.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.000
Did you threaten to kill Stevie?

28:41.800 --> 28:44.640
Oh, right. Er, I don't know.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.280
Might have, yeah.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.280
Well, we say it all the time, right?

28:48.320 --> 28:49.720
I mean, I wouldn't actually kill him.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.880
He's like a brother to me.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.000
He is your brother.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.240
Yeah, it's right, that.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.400
What were you fighting about?

28:59.440 --> 29:02.440
I can't remember. Summat and nothing, I suppose.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.400
-I'm not.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.600
Neatly pressed shirt.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.880
Boots mid-polish on the table.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.320
Must be going somewhere you want to make an impression.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.680
I'm just going around and about.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.760
Soak up a bit of the Caribbean vibe

29:16.720 --> 29:19.760
and that, yeah?

29:19.800 --> 29:22.960
So, if you've got no more questions...

29:24.960 --> 29:26.240
DWAYNE: <i> You think</i> <i>he's hiding something?</i>

29:26.280 --> 29:28.200
Yeah, it's possible.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.880
He clearly didn't want us to know what his argument

29:28.240 --> 29:30.880
with Stevie was about.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.040
And he was very cagey about where he was going tonight.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.720
Hang on a minute.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.240
On the recording, Jim was asking

29:35.760 --> 29:39.240
something about a bar.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.640
Bullet Bar. Maybe that's where he's going.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.440
You want us to head down there and see what he's up to?

29:43.480 --> 29:45.560
A little light surveillance might not hurt at all.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.720
Thank you, Dwayne.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.360
Er, the post-mortem reports have come through.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.720
They've confirmed Stevie suffered

29:51.760 --> 29:53.680
sudden cardiac arrest due to electrocution,

29:53.720 --> 29:55.280
and they're not disputing the time of death.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.760
So, we now know for definite that he was

29:55.320 --> 29:57.760
murdered at 12:00.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.320
Right, you'd better get changed and head

29:57.800 --> 30:00.320
over to the Bullet Bar.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.360
Chief.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.880
Stevie was killed at noon.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.320
The recording we have confirms

30:07.360 --> 30:09.640
that our five suspects were all together at that time.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.080
But someone had to have been by the pool

30:11.120 --> 30:13.280
to push the stage lights in and electrocute Stevie.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.440
Who was it and how?

30:16.040 --> 30:18.200
And what about you, little fella?

30:21.080 --> 30:22.360
How did you get there?

30:23.880 --> 30:26.440
I found the fan magazine you were talking about online.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.560
<i>-The Flower Seeds.</i> -Oh! Good work, Florence.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.320
There's quite a few editions. Shall we take half each?

30:31.360 --> 30:33.240
That's almost a very good idea.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.600
-Yes.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.160
In order to make it a truly brilliant idea,

30:36.200 --> 30:37.680
you might have added that we take half each,

30:37.720 --> 30:39.360
decamp to Catherine's Bar, and read them there.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.760
-I'd say that is

30:39.400 --> 30:42.760
a much better idea.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.400
Excellent.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.440
We're not allowed to drink on duty, are we?

31:03.480 --> 31:05.080
It's so we can blend in.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.560
I'm very dedicated to my undercover work,

31:05.120 --> 31:07.560
you know.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.680
I mean, very, very dedicated.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.160
Raise them high, drain them dry.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.640
Only I'm not really

31:19.080 --> 31:21.640
a big drinker, sir.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.320
You know how it is.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.320
No, I don't. Now, get it down you.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.040
Soothe your throat with your beer, the man!

31:37.320 --> 31:38.360
Look.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.760
No, don't look. He's meeting someone.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.920
-Bide our time.

31:43.960 --> 31:48.040
If they separate, I'll tail the woman.

31:43.960 --> 31:48.040
You follow Jim. Okay?

31:51.680 --> 31:53.480
Edited by Daisy Buttercup.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.440
Photography by Daisy Buttercup.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.440
Articles on the band by...

32:01.480 --> 32:04.120
-Oh, she's not real.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.360
It's a song on the first album,

32:05.400 --> 32:07.000
and not a particularly good one at that.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.920
It was clearly a one-nutty-fan operation.

32:09.960 --> 32:13.200
You're a fan. Are you Daisy Buttercup?

32:13.240 --> 32:14.520
Yes, I am not a fan.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.560
Just following Angela Matterson's orders?

32:18.800 --> 32:20.720
Did anything ever happen between you and Angela?

32:20.760 --> 32:23.440
Oh, gosh, no, no, no. We... We never even held hands.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.920
Ah, perhaps it wasn't a bad thing.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.120
Life would have spun me off in a different direction.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.720
I certainly wouldn't be here.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.400
You have your own male Angela Matterson?

32:35.440 --> 32:37.680
Not quite. My five brothers.

32:37.720 --> 32:42.240
If ever I brought a boy to the house, they always

32:37.720 --> 32:42.240
managed to scare him off.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.200
-Simple, really.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.160
I stopped taking my boyfriends back

32:44.240 --> 32:47.160
to meet my brothers.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.800
Touche.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.760
JP! Jim's on the move!

33:07.360 --> 33:09.240
You'd better follow him.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.640
JP! Ah, man! What am I meant to do now?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.160
Ah.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.600
Er, excuse me, miss.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.960
My young and, er, very inexperienced friend here

33:22.000 --> 33:24.280
has had a little too much to drink.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.800
But I must finish these before I leave.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.360
Would you be so kind as to help me with them?

33:44.520 --> 33:45.560
Oh, I see. Er, well, yes,

33:45.600 --> 33:47.320
a kind of a trip, although not for me.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.960
And it's, erm, sort of already happened.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.680
Our friend, the click beetle.

33:53.720 --> 33:55.440
Trying to work out whether it's possible

33:55.480 --> 33:58.120
he could have made the journey between

33:55.480 --> 33:58.120
Martinique and Saint-Marie.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.080
And?

34:00.120 --> 34:02.160
Well, it's a good 70 miles between the two islands and,

34:02.200 --> 34:06.600
while click beetles can fly, it's really only at night,

34:02.200 --> 34:06.600
and really rather rare.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.920
Maybe he ended up on a boat or a plane

34:06.640 --> 34:09.920
and got carried over.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.680
Yes, well, I've also looked into that.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.040
Um, all planes leaving the Caribbean

34:14.080 --> 34:17.160
are sprayed with insecticides before departure.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.160
Well, he would have been dead before he left Martinique.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.000
Well, you've certainly been very thorough.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.080
Do you think maybe we should...

34:26.120 --> 34:27.760
Oh, yes, yes. Yes, of course. Quite right.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.760
Don't even think about it.

34:45.760 --> 34:49.160
So, we know the night before his murder,

34:45.760 --> 34:49.160
Stevie was fighting with Jim.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.480
The two of them have always had a stormy relationship,

34:51.520 --> 34:55.320
but we don't know specifically what this argument was about.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.480
Vince. Stevie burnt his studio down.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.440
And, as we know from insurance checks,

34:57.520 --> 35:00.440
he wasn't covered.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.920
Quite.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.640
-Morning, all. -Morning. How did you

35:01.960 --> 35:03.640
get on last night?

35:03.680 --> 35:05.320
Oh, pretty good, Chief.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.920
Exactly like you thought, Jim turned up to

35:05.360 --> 35:07.920
the Bullet Bar,

35:07.960 --> 35:09.680
where he met and had a drink with a woman.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.760
Right. Did you manage to find out who she was?

35:11.800 --> 35:13.320
More than that, Chief.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.240
Her name was Marie Etner.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.000
She was a girl Jim knew from the last time the band were

35:16.280 --> 35:20.000
on the island back in 1991.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.160
Er, she and Jim had a bit of a thing, you know?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.760
Ah, interesting. Go on.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.240
DWAYNE: Well, that's only the start.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.240
Turns out she fell pregnant and had his kid.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.800
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.400
Jim never even knew he was the father,

35:31.440 --> 35:32.920
not until the day before yesterday.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.080
-I... I don't understand. -DWAYNE: Look.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.280
When Marie found out she was pregnant,

35:35.120 --> 35:37.280
she called Jim.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.880
But she could only get hold of Stevie, and he promised

35:37.320 --> 35:40.880
to pass the message on.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.120
And what

35:42.160 --> 35:44.560
-No. -So, let me get this right.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.720
Stevie was never going to tell his own brother

35:44.600 --> 35:47.720
he was going to be a dad?

35:47.760 --> 35:50.680
Exactly. He only found out about it two days ago.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.960
That must be why they were arguing in Stevie's room.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.480
-Good work, Dwayne. -Thank you, Chief.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.080
Florence, I think you and I need to go and speak to Jim.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.880
-I am really sorry, everyone...

35:59.920 --> 36:02.320
Er, Jim's still in his room, yeah?

36:03.520 --> 36:05.400
Er, good work. Right, Chief?

36:06.360 --> 36:08.000
Yes.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.920
Come on, Florence!

36:10.960 --> 36:14.120
-DWAYNE: Sarge. -I... I overslept. I was going

36:10.960 --> 36:14.120
to come clean and...

36:14.160 --> 36:18.280
And I covered for you. It's what they don't teach you

36:14.160 --> 36:18.280
at police college.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.240
We are a team.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.280
So, I'll be counting on you to do exactly the same thing

36:20.280 --> 36:23.280
for me next Thursday, when I'm recovering

36:23.320 --> 36:26.320
from Domino Club and a few large rums.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.240
Now, get yourself an aspirin and get to it.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.440
We got a lot of work to do.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.840
Chop chop!

36:40.000 --> 36:42.960
You didn't get on well, you and Stevie?

36:43.000 --> 36:46.040
We had a couple of fallouts and the press built it up,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.040
yeah?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.240
It was nothing serious.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.680
-No!

36:48.720 --> 36:50.000
Even when he kept things from you?

36:52.600 --> 36:54.240
Like you becoming a father?

36:57.320 --> 36:58.320
You spoke with Marie?

37:06.280 --> 37:09.360
It was Vince who told me that I had a son.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.640
He thought I knew about it and I just didn't care,

37:13.680 --> 37:16.800
that I was being, you know, same old Jimbo.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.760
When I told Stevie,

37:20.800 --> 37:25.040
I said I couldn't believe I'd had a kid all these years

37:20.800 --> 37:25.040
and never knew about it,

37:25.080 --> 37:27.160
and that's when he come clean.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.600
Told me that he'd known all along.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.000
That's what you were fighting about

37:29.640 --> 37:32.000
in his hotel room?

37:32.040 --> 37:35.440
That's one word for it.

37:38.560 --> 37:43.760
You know, people dream about the lifestyle

37:38.560 --> 37:43.760
that we used to lead.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.840
Partying all night. Girls on tab. It was crazy.

37:48.680 --> 37:53.320
But if all you actually really want is to meet

37:48.680 --> 37:53.320
someone and settle down,

37:53.360 --> 37:56.240
it's not exactly the right environment,

37:53.360 --> 37:56.240
if you know what I mean.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.480
Is that what you wanted?

37:58.200 --> 37:59.640
I'd have loved it.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.840
A wife. A kid.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.200
A family.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.560
Just never seemed to happen.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.320
Well, it did.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.920
Just nobody told me.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.680
So, why didn't Stevie tell you?

38:15.720 --> 38:19.600
Because we'd had a big fight about something

38:15.720 --> 38:19.600
and we weren't talking.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.800
He kept it from me to spite me.

38:22.840 --> 38:26.840
He admitted it. Apologised, even,

38:22.840 --> 38:26.840
which Stevie never does.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.560
Said that he'd messed up years ago and wished he'd

38:26.880 --> 38:30.560
have done things differently.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.000
Said he wanted to put things right.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.400
Did you let him

38:34.440 --> 38:36.560
No. I couldn't. Maybe in time I might have.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.600
But...

38:42.640 --> 38:44.440
So, what did you do?

38:47.280 --> 38:50.080
Hey, hang on. You don't seriously think

38:50.120 --> 38:52.320
I had anything to do with his death, do you?

38:52.360 --> 38:54.920
-Look, I hated Stevie

38:52.360 --> 38:54.920
for what he did.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.640
But he was my brother! I wouldn't kill him!

38:57.680 --> 39:02.280
Look, you want a suspect to talk to,

38:57.680 --> 39:02.280
you've so got the wrong guy.

39:02.320 --> 39:06.280
There's members of this band who've got a real axe to grind

39:02.320 --> 39:06.280
with my brother.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.360
<i>Merci.</i>

39:27.920 --> 39:31.720
It's a little, er, down at heel

39:27.920 --> 39:31.720
for a millionaire.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.200
I like it. It's real.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.440
When we were recording the first album,

39:37.480 --> 39:39.680
me and Stevie used to hang out in places like this.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.440
Jam with the locals.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.240
Ah, great days.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.280
Well, they were, until Stevie got drunk

39:44.280 --> 39:47.280
and wound everyone up.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.400
Jim tells us you started legal proceedings

39:47.320 --> 39:50.400
against Stevie?

39:50.440 --> 39:53.200
It's nothing. Loads of bands end up in courtrooms.

39:53.240 --> 39:56.840
And those cases are usually for huge amounts,

39:53.240 --> 39:56.840
whereas your claim is...

39:56.880 --> 39:58.600
For a pound.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.840
-Pound of flesh'd

39:58.640 --> 40:02.840
be more appropriate.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.760
I didn't want people thinking I was doing it for the money.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.160
Why are you doing it?

40:07.200 --> 40:08.800
Credit.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.000
Aside from one or two tracks on that first album,

40:11.040 --> 40:13.320
we all contributed to the writing and recording.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.000
But you look at the writing credits

40:13.360 --> 40:16.000
for every track and it's...

40:16.040 --> 40:18.360
Lyrics by Stevie, music by Pete?

40:18.400 --> 40:21.600
-Smith and Thunders, yeah. -HUMPHREY: It's a fairly

40:18.400 --> 40:21.600
normal arrangement, isn't it?

40:23.960 --> 40:26.200
I wrote specific lines.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.200
I wrote verses for songs that I took to Stevie.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.480
He said they wouldn't work, and then, a day or so later,

40:31.520 --> 40:33.960
they'd crop up again in another song

40:31.520 --> 40:33.960
that he's written.

40:35.320 --> 40:38.040
I just want to set the record straight.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.640
I want my credit.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.320
There's nothing wrong with wanting that, is there?

40:45.360 --> 40:47.600
Now, if you'll excuse me...

40:59.600 --> 41:01.360
I spoke with Disco's lawyer,

41:01.400 --> 41:04.840
who said it would have been hard to prove that

41:01.400 --> 41:04.840
he co-wrote the songs,

41:04.880 --> 41:08.240
and that instead he should have appealed

41:04.880 --> 41:08.240
to Stevie's goodwill.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.880
Mmm, I wonder where that got him.

41:09.920 --> 41:13.080
Apparently, Stevie told Disco he'd amend the credit listing

41:13.120 --> 41:15.920
on any reissue of the first album.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.640
But then the record company just sent this over.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.840
It's the design for the reissued

41:20.280 --> 41:22.840
album artwork,

41:22.880 --> 41:25.560
and, as you'll see, no mention of Disco Biscuit.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.400
Has Disco seen this?

41:27.440 --> 41:30.400
All band members were sent an early copy for approval

41:27.440 --> 41:30.400
two days ago.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.480
So, Disco Biscuit knew that Stevie was shafting him?

41:33.520 --> 41:35.800
Which is fine, is fine,

41:35.840 --> 41:38.840
but while he may have had a motive, he didn't

41:35.840 --> 41:38.840
have the opportunity.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.360
See, from the recordings,

41:40.400 --> 41:42.320
we know that Disco was in the studio

41:40.400 --> 41:42.320
when the power went out.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.920
-As was Vince. -Yes, I know.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.400
-And Pete and Cheryl. -Yes, thank you.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.720
-And Jim. -Yes, I know.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.040
FLORENCE: None of them had the opportunity.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.000
HUMPHREY: "Lee Vale Productions."

41:55.400 --> 41:58.400
Lee Vale. Lee Vale.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.560
Where have I heard that name before?

42:01.600 --> 42:03.280
Who is this Lee Vale?

42:03.320 --> 42:06.800
No, Lee Vale isn't a person. It's, er, some kind

42:03.320 --> 42:06.800
of record company.

42:06.840 --> 42:10.960
Lee Vale Productions. They're behind the reissue

42:06.840 --> 42:10.960
of the album. Lee Vale.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.280
-Yes.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.320
Er, 17 Lee Vale, Marston, Oxford...

42:19.720 --> 42:21.760
Of course. <i> Flower Seeds.</i>

42:25.160 --> 42:26.640
-Here. -And here.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.520
"Edited by Daisy Buttercup." Her address is...

42:28.560 --> 42:30.840
"17 Lee Vale, Marston, Oxford."

42:30.880 --> 42:33.120
So, Daisy Buttercup is Lee Vale Productions?

42:33.160 --> 42:36.960
-The one and the same. -So, who is this notorious

42:33.160 --> 42:36.960
Miss Daisy Buttercup?

42:37.960 --> 42:39.520
I know.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.520
HUMPHREY: Thank you for your time, Cheryl.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.000
Or do you prefer "Daisy Buttercup"?

42:49.920 --> 42:52.520
I'm sorry. I'm going to have to go

42:49.920 --> 42:52.520
and, erm, change.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.840
Oh, no, don't worry. It will soon dry in the sun.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.600
Care to bring us up to speed about how Daisy,

42:58.640 --> 43:03.000
the number

43:03.040 --> 43:05.760
Disco Biscuit bought my house. That's, er, how we met and...

43:05.800 --> 43:07.600
And according to our research,

43:07.640 --> 43:11.400
you've been in the music business

43:07.640 --> 43:11.400
for three months.

43:11.440 --> 43:14.760
I know I'm not exactly what you'd call, er,

43:11.440 --> 43:14.760
qualified, but...

43:14.800 --> 43:16.880
I have very good organisational skills

43:16.920 --> 43:20.400
and when I set my mind to something,

43:16.920 --> 43:20.400
I make sure it happens.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.840
I got the band back together again.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.840
I did the deal with the beer company.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.920
I mean, even yesterday, Stevie was saying he wasn't

43:23.880 --> 43:26.920
going to sign the contract.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.520
But, you know, then, when it came to it, he did.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.680
I mean, I... I made that happen.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.880
This must be a dream come true for you.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.960
Sorry?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.560
Managing the one rock band you've spent

43:39.000 --> 43:41.560
your life following.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.880
Adoring.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.920
Yeah, I guess I'm very fortunate.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.280
And who in the band knew that as well as their manager,

43:48.320 --> 43:50.440
you're actually their biggest fan?

43:51.960 --> 43:53.240
None of them.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.160
So, what exactly were you up to?

43:56.200 --> 43:58.160
Sorry, I don't know what you mean.

43:58.200 --> 44:01.240
Well, I mean, come on. Your behaviour is verging

43:58.200 --> 44:01.240
on that of a stalker.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.760
That... That is not true.

44:05.800 --> 44:09.720
I... I just wanted to try something new...

44:05.800 --> 44:09.720
I just... With my life.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.440
You know, try something different.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.760
You did it to get close to Stevie, didn't you?

44:16.960 --> 44:19.200
What?

44:19.240 --> 44:23.560
That necklace, I've seen it before.

44:23.600 --> 44:27.160
Grand Central Beer? I'm no sell-out,

44:23.600 --> 44:27.160
especially not that stuff.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.000
It's crap!

44:29.040 --> 44:30.880
It belonged to Stevie, didn't it?

44:31.560 --> 44:33.080
He gave it to me. Seems quite

44:33.120 --> 44:34.640
a personal kind of gift.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.200
Were you and Stevie having a relationship?

44:41.640 --> 44:43.160
I fell for him.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.960
I'd always had a crush on him since I was a...

44:47.000 --> 44:49.360
A kid. But I thought I was over it,

44:49.400 --> 44:53.560
and then, you know, we met, and he just swept me

44:49.400 --> 44:53.560
off my feet.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.920
And then?

44:55.840 --> 44:57.400
He, um...

44:57.440 --> 44:59.120
He... He ended it.

45:00.560 --> 45:03.800
He'd fallen in love with the band again, you see,

45:03.840 --> 45:07.160
and, you know, he needed to concentrate on that.

45:07.200 --> 45:10.680
HUMPHREY: <i> And were you</i> <i>okay with him ending it?</i>

45:11.480 --> 45:12.880
No!

45:12.920 --> 45:13.920
I was not okay.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.160
Yeah, okay, I admit it.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.160
I was in love with him.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.760
And that's exactly why I wouldn't have killed him.

45:24.080 --> 45:28.120
The answer has to be here, somewhere.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.160
Stevie Smith had a fling with Cheryl Moore,

45:29.680 --> 45:33.160
number-one fan.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.040
Breaks her heart.

45:35.080 --> 45:38.000
Disco Biscuit's suing Stevie for not crediting him.

45:38.040 --> 45:41.440
Jim Smith could have been a father,

45:38.040 --> 45:41.440
had Stevie not hushed it up.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.240
Vince. Stevie burnt his studio down.

45:44.280 --> 45:46.840
All of them have a motive. But none of them

45:46.880 --> 45:49.440
had the opportunity.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.560
At 12:00, Stevie was having his daily swim.

45:51.600 --> 45:56.320
One of the suspects pushes live stage lights into

45:51.600 --> 45:56.320
the pool, electrocuting him.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.800
They then sawed one of the support pins in half,

45:58.840 --> 46:00.560
in an attempt to make it look like it had,

46:00.600 --> 46:02.440
after years of use, finally broken,

46:02.480 --> 46:04.760
meaning Stevie's death looked like an awful accident.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.640
But... But for that very reason, we know

46:04.800 --> 46:08.640
he was actually murdered,

46:08.680 --> 46:10.400
and the only five people who could have done it

46:10.440 --> 46:12.920
were all together in the studio when it happened,

46:12.960 --> 46:16.160
thus presenting us with what is, it would seem,

46:12.960 --> 46:16.160
an impossible murder.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.320
We are getting nowhere!

46:20.840 --> 46:24.240
Let's take a break, clear our heads.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.600
And you're not helping matters.

46:30.680 --> 46:32.080
I mean, why were you there?

46:32.120 --> 46:34.320
Why were you at our crime scene?

46:35.840 --> 46:38.440
-You're talking to a dead beetle.

46:35.840 --> 46:38.440
-I know I am.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.280
Do you think maybe you should get some fresh air?

46:40.320 --> 46:42.440
That's probably a very good idea.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.520
Ah, sir?

47:07.880 --> 47:09.560
It will soon dry in the sun.

47:13.040 --> 47:14.880
HUMPHREY: Why were you at our crime scene?

47:14.920 --> 47:17.800
Maybe he ended up on a boat or a plane

47:14.920 --> 47:17.800
and got carried over.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.640
I think the pin snapped and the whole thing fell

47:17.840 --> 47:20.640
into the swimming pool.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.760
Ha!

47:22.480 --> 47:24.320
Right.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.320
Of course.

47:31.360 --> 47:35.360
The last time anyone is heard leaving the studio

47:31.360 --> 47:35.360
after Stevie is 10:00.

47:35.400 --> 47:38.760
Stevie was excited, reenergised.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.560
Said he wanted to put things right.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.080
Yesterday, Stevie was saying he wasn't going to sign

47:40.600 --> 47:43.080
the contract,

47:43.120 --> 47:45.240
but when it came to it, he did.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.560
STEVIE: Grand Central Beer?

47:49.600 --> 47:53.200
No way. I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.

47:49.600 --> 47:53.200
It's crap!

47:56.000 --> 47:58.520
Yes, I think I have. We need to get

47:56.000 --> 47:58.520
everyone together.

47:58.560 --> 48:02.040
But first I need to check something in the studio.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.080
Oh, and, Dwayne, catering. You want me to bring food?

48:05.120 --> 48:09.000
The company who provided the catering equipment at the

48:05.120 --> 48:09.000
studio, dig out their details.

48:09.040 --> 48:10.480
Come on, JP!

48:24.280 --> 48:26.000
Got it. Bag it.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.960
Good.

48:45.920 --> 48:46.960
Yes.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.600
Okay.

48:51.640 --> 48:56.200
First off, apologies for bringing you all out here to

48:51.640 --> 48:56.200
the scene of Stevie's murder.

48:56.240 --> 49:01.440
Now, I know he was a good friend to all of you,

48:56.240 --> 49:01.440
a brother to some of you.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.880
So, why would any of you want to kill him?

49:04.760 --> 49:06.720
-Cheryl... -I didn't do it!

49:06.760 --> 49:08.880
...AKA Daisy Buttercup.

49:08.920 --> 49:12.480
Number-one fan. Editor of the fanzine

49:08.920 --> 49:12.480
<i>Flower Seeds.</i>

49:12.520 --> 49:15.960
-Responsible for

49:12.520 --> 49:15.960
reuniting the band. -I'm no killer.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.440
-But you are Stevie's biggest fan.

49:19.480 --> 49:24.000
And his lover, briefly, before he broke your heart.

49:24.040 --> 49:27.840
Vince? You strike me as being a very patient man,

49:27.880 --> 49:30.920
biding your time, waiting for Stevie to return,

49:30.960 --> 49:33.360
the man who burned down your studio and ruined you.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.880
I couldn't kill Stevie.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.880
I couldn't kill anyone.

49:36.920 --> 49:39.240
And Disco Biscuit.

49:39.280 --> 49:41.680
I'd prefer it if you call me Duncan.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.760
-I wouldn't.

49:44.800 --> 49:48.080
Even though your contribution to the band has never

49:44.800 --> 49:48.080
been recognised?

49:48.120 --> 49:51.320
Stevie still ensured the reissued CD

49:48.120 --> 49:51.320
didn't credit you.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.560
I was in the studio when Stevie was killed.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.280
Of course you were.

49:55.320 --> 49:57.760
Rock-solid alibi, same as everyone else.

49:57.800 --> 50:00.040
And Jim.

50:01.640 --> 50:05.280
Stevie deprived you of the one thing

50:01.640 --> 50:05.280
you wanted in life.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.120
A family.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.440
I told you, Stevie was my brother.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.520
I wouldn't have hurt him.

50:12.560 --> 50:13.640
No.

50:14.440 --> 50:17.000
No, but Pete would.

50:17.040 --> 50:19.880
We know you attacked Stevie in Cardiff

50:17.040 --> 50:19.880
when the band split,

50:19.920 --> 50:21.960
and we also know that Stevie potentially costing you

50:22.000 --> 50:24.160
the beer commercial money was "Cardiff again."

50:29.400 --> 50:31.320
And now we know you murdered him.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.160
You what?

50:38.200 --> 50:40.720
Grand Central Beer brought you all back together,

50:40.760 --> 50:43.040
and it pushed you all apart again, didn't it?

50:43.080 --> 50:46.440
It was an accident! What are you going on about?

50:46.480 --> 50:49.720
Stevie may have initially been seduced by a quick payday,

50:50.680 --> 50:52.880
but then things changed for him.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.920
No way. I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.840
I told you, the beer company are delighted with

50:55.960 --> 50:59.840
that little clip.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.040
But there was a bigger problem than the bad press

51:02.080 --> 51:03.880
that clip might have brought you, wasn't there?

51:04.600 --> 51:07.080
Stevie, the new Stevie

51:08.560 --> 51:10.200
didn't want to sell out.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.320
He was still a man of the people...

51:13.840 --> 51:16.680
And because of that, he refused to sign

51:13.840 --> 51:16.680
that contract.

51:16.720 --> 51:19.680
But I told you, he did. He did sign the contract.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.480
And you saw Stevie sign it?

51:22.240 --> 51:23.320
No.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.960
-Pete did. -FLORENCE:

51:25.680 --> 51:28.960
The date on the contract

51:29.000 --> 51:31.960
indicates that Stevie signed it yesterday morning.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
HUMPHREY: He was pretty adamant in that recording.

51:34.040 --> 51:37.760
I think he had no intention of changing his mind

51:34.040 --> 51:37.760
and signing that contract,

51:37.800 --> 51:39.760
and that is why you had to kill him,

51:40.960 --> 51:42.440
so you could forge his signature

51:42.480 --> 51:44.680
and collect the half a million dollars

51:42.480 --> 51:44.680
you so needed.

51:44.720 --> 51:48.720
This is ridiculous. How would I forge

51:44.720 --> 51:48.720
his signature?

51:48.760 --> 51:52.320
Oh, it's not that hard. I mean, not if you

51:48.760 --> 51:52.320
had the means.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.640
Just place this under the contract where

51:55.520 --> 51:58.640
Stevie's signature should be,

51:58.680 --> 52:01.400
and just trace it over.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.400
The thing is, if you had done it that way,

52:03.440 --> 52:05.440
er, then you would be able to see the indentations

52:05.480 --> 52:07.360
where you went over Stevie's signature.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.600
Erm, there.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.400
Half a million dollars split between you and Stevie.

52:18.440 --> 52:22.080
Plus the prospect of capitalising on the advert,

52:18.440 --> 52:22.080
and touring.

52:22.120 --> 52:24.240
How are we going to tour without a singer?

52:24.280 --> 52:26.320
This band is nothing without Stevie.

52:26.360 --> 52:29.200
Oh, I don't think you believe that for a second.

52:29.240 --> 52:33.120
That's why you made sure that Stevie died

52:29.240 --> 52:33.120
in such an iconic way.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.880
Electrocuted in a swimming pool. Legend!

52:38.880 --> 52:40.520
I mean, the publicity and the attention

52:38.880 --> 52:40.520
would be enormous.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.400
You would clean up.

52:42.440 --> 52:45.080
But Pete was with us in the studio when Stevie was...

52:45.120 --> 52:46.720
HUMPHREY: Was murdered, yes.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.520
DISCO: Oh, come on!

52:52.200 --> 52:53.280
That was the clever part.

52:56.120 --> 52:59.400
How could someone be at the pool to push

52:56.120 --> 52:59.400
the stage lights in

52:59.440 --> 53:02.320
when all of you were in the studio the entire morning?

53:03.600 --> 53:04.640
All except for you, Pete.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.320
It was around 10:00 when you popped out,

53:09.360 --> 53:12.080
perfect time to set your trap.

53:12.120 --> 53:15.160
Your intention was for us to assume that the whole thing

53:12.120 --> 53:15.160
was an accident,

53:15.200 --> 53:17.600
a worn pin snapping after years of use.

53:17.640 --> 53:21.160
I think the pin snapped and the whole thing

53:17.640 --> 53:21.160
fell into the swimming pool.

53:21.200 --> 53:25.000
And that's how we knew it was murder all along.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.400
The pin

53:28.480 --> 53:31.840
had been very clearly cut with a saw.

53:33.480 --> 53:34.640
Which brings us to...

53:41.480 --> 53:46.120
...the click beetle, who was an unknowing

53:41.480 --> 53:46.120
accomplice to murder.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.080
You see, when we first arrived on the crime scene,

53:48.120 --> 53:50.120
it bothered me that there was water

53:50.160 --> 53:52.840
in the planter that was sitting in front

53:50.160 --> 53:52.840
of the fallen lighting stand,

53:52.880 --> 53:54.400
but not in any of the others.

53:56.600 --> 54:00.080
The supply company Cheryl used for the party,

53:56.600 --> 54:00.080
we checked it.

54:00.120 --> 54:02.240
Some of the gear came from Martinique.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.560
It was the same island our click beetle came from.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.400
You know, I think he hopped into the catering equipment,

54:07.440 --> 54:10.600
a freezer, to be specific, and got shipped over,

54:10.640 --> 54:13.480
and so our little beetle here

54:13.520 --> 54:16.680
ended up encased in a block of ice.

54:16.720 --> 54:20.760
<i>In fact, the one particular</i> <i>block of ice you used</i>

54:16.720 --> 54:20.760
<i>to kill Stevie Smith.</i>

54:20.800 --> 54:23.040
<i>Earlier in the morning</i> <i>at 10:00,</i>

54:23.080 --> 54:26.000
<i>knowing that Stevie would</i> <i>take his daily swim at noon,</i>

54:26.040 --> 54:28.640
<i>you used one of the caterer's</i> <i>blocks of ice</i>

54:28.680 --> 54:31.560
<i>to rest one of the legs</i> <i>of the lighting stand on,</i>

54:31.600 --> 54:34.240
<i>and as the sun was</i> <i>at its midday height,</i>

54:35.680 --> 54:38.600
<i>the ice would melt,</i> <i>the support would fail...</i>

54:39.840 --> 54:42.320
<i>...Stevie would be</i> <i>electrocuted.</i>

54:42.360 --> 54:45.760
And with the planter placed at the front of the stage,

54:45.800 --> 54:49.000
you'd even planned a place for the melted water

54:45.800 --> 54:49.000
to drain off,

54:49.040 --> 54:50.720
leaving no trace.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.640
Well, er...

54:53.600 --> 54:54.760
Almost no trace.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.760
Hats off to you, Mr Thunders.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.320
You really gave us a run for our money.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.280
Very entertaining.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.120
But what a load of... Rubbish.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.600
Is it?

55:21.240 --> 55:22.920
No.

55:22.960 --> 55:26.080
You... You don't do that to me.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.760
That man! That idiot!

55:30.800 --> 55:32.480
I'm the artist!

55:32.520 --> 55:36.880
Every bad thing that ever happened

55:32.520 --> 55:36.880
to us was because of him!

55:44.440 --> 55:46.000
Can't... Can't swim!

55:47.640 --> 55:49.120
Hold your feet down!

56:02.560 --> 56:03.760
Chief!

56:05.800 --> 56:07.920
JP seems to have fitted in well.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.600
Well, yeah, er... Yes, Florence.

56:09.640 --> 56:11.560
He's... He's not the only one, though.

56:11.600 --> 56:16.760
Er, I have to say that you have been absolutely,

56:11.600 --> 56:16.760
unquestionably brilliant

56:16.800 --> 56:17.880
over the last two days.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.040
Thank you.

56:19.080 --> 56:21.280
No, I mean, the way you handled Cheryl.

56:21.320 --> 56:23.480
Spotting the necklace. Her affair with Stevie.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.120
It's just phenomenal.

56:25.160 --> 56:28.960
And then there's, well, everything else, really.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.720
Every time I've lost the plot or couldn't find

56:29.000 --> 56:31.720
a piece of evidence,

56:31.760 --> 56:34.280
or literally have nowhere to turn, there you were.

56:34.320 --> 56:38.160
I mean, I... I mean, it's like we've been partners for years.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.720
What

56:43.560 --> 56:45.600
I have a confession.

56:45.640 --> 56:48.080
I received a letter from Camille.

56:48.120 --> 56:49.600
Oh?

56:49.640 --> 56:52.120
Yeah. With very detailed instructions on how to

56:49.640 --> 56:52.120
deal with you.

56:53.520 --> 56:56.320
So, if there's anyone you should thank, it's her.

56:56.360 --> 56:59.840
Well, even so, very well done.

56:59.880 --> 57:03.120
Congratulations on completing your first case as a DS.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.160
-To you. -To Camille.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.360
To you both.

57:08.280 --> 57:12.520
Although... Although you are already a great DS,

57:12.560 --> 57:15.080
and I'm sure will become an even better DS,

57:15.120 --> 57:17.360
there are many, many more things

57:15.120 --> 57:17.360
you need to learn

57:17.400 --> 57:19.320
before becoming a truly amazing DS.

57:19.360 --> 57:22.080
I know. I know there's so much work to do and...

57:22.120 --> 57:24.200
I'm not talking about work.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.640
Every good detective should have their dancing shoes on,

57:26.680 --> 57:28.600
and this is a good and happy tune. Come on.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.160
-No. -Come on.

when it comes to international sports, you know.

58:16.360 --> 58:20.160
Honour and sportsmanship is the nature of the game,

58:20.200 --> 58:22.560
not always the nature of those that play it.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.360
-This is Anton Borridge. -Er, Burrage.
