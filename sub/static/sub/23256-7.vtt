WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.303
- Previously on Nashville...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.338
- Um, hi, Nashville.
How you all doing?

00:04.372 --> 00:06.107
My name is Twig Wysecki.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.309
Most of you probably know mw
as the guy who's holding

00:08.342 --> 00:09.310
Jonah Ford's beer.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.314
Mine's a Nazi and yours
is a rageaholic.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.648
- Yeah, I'm just not
feeling it, yet.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.484
- I mean, I can pull it
back if that helps.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.620
- Things could get
pretty messy, you know?

00:19.653 --> 00:21.322
It's just totally casual.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.191
- Yeah, it's never
casual with you, Gunnar.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.258
- No, I swear.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.793
- We have an outreach program.
It's in Bolivia.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.529
- Hey, it's Juliette. Leave a
message and I'll call you back.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.203
- What is going...
Let... let me take this.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.237
- Thank you.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.373
- Goodness, girl!

00:39.407 --> 00:41.109
- I know...

00:41.142 --> 00:42.510
- You going for three days
or three weeks?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.378
- Ha-ha.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.248
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.483
- All right, can
I just say that...

00:49.517 --> 00:51.319
- No.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.121
You know what
I'm gonna say?

00:53.154 --> 00:55.323
- I know it's about Jonah.
- I don't know Jonah.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.225
- That's the problem.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.226
- That's what I'm saying.
Just...

00:59.560 --> 01:01.162
Bail on the concert,
which is tonight?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.596
- I'm not worried about
a concert, sweetheart.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.864
I'm worried about the
three days in Miami

01:03.897 --> 01:05.499
after the concert
where you just...

01:05.533 --> 01:07.735
- I could be her chaperone.
- I'm an adult.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.538
- I haven't forgotten.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.173
Even though
I want to sometimes.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.407
- I love you.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.808
- I love you, too.
Be safe.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.445
- I love you, Daphne.
- I love you. Bye.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.449
- Okay, you,
that's enough cereal.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.317
Go on up and get dressed.

01:23.351 --> 01:26.154
Love you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.421
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.856
Is this a bad time?

01:28.889 --> 01:30.858
- I have two teenaged daughters.
Never a bad time.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.560
What's up?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.562
- I was just calling to give
you some fair warning

01:34.595 --> 01:37.565
that Brad is gonna be
at the Open House tonight.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.400
Probably with his new wife.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.535
- Well, it is his
son's school, so...

01:41.569 --> 01:43.404
- Well, no. I know.
I know it's stupid.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.839
I just wanted to make sure that
we don't do anything that,

01:45.873 --> 01:48.276
I don't know, provokes him.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.643
- What do you mean, like if I
slapped you on the back side?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.312
- Yes!

01:51.345 --> 01:53.547
You probably should not
slap me on the back side, okay?

01:53.581 --> 01:54.882
- Okay, I won't do that.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.784
- Jake! Eggs!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.720
Anyway, I'm serious, though.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.322
- Yes, ma'am.

02:01.355 --> 02:05.826
- Thank you.

02:05.859 --> 02:09.697
- * I was born at the end
of an old dirt road *

02:11.632 --> 02:14.168
* Before I could walk,
I was ready to roll *

02:16.704 --> 02:19.640
* When I turned 16, my brother
threw me the key *

02:21.609 --> 02:24.545
* He said, hey, little sister,
better watch your speed *

02:24.578 --> 02:27.448
* Now I'm smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

02:27.481 --> 02:29.783
* Takin' a drag and
I'm making some noise *

02:29.817 --> 02:32.653
- * Smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

02:33.921 --> 02:35.556
- * Smokin' the boys *

02:38.459 --> 02:39.593
I think we may
have something here.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.894
- Think you're right.

02:41.962 --> 02:42.930
Oh, excuse me?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.665
Bucky?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.867
- Hey! I wasn't halfway through
my second cup of coffee

02:46.900 --> 02:48.636
this morning when
I got three phone calls

02:48.669 --> 02:50.371
concerning this
band of yours.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.673
- Oh, let me just put
you on speaker. Hold on.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.275
- No, wait, Gunnar.
I don't know if you...

02:54.308 --> 02:55.476
- All right, Bucky.
You're on with the band.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.510
- Hey, Bucky!
- Hey, Bucky!

02:56.544 --> 02:58.279
- Hey.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.714
I was just saying that
several reporters

03:00.748 --> 03:03.517
are demanding interviews...
with Alannah.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.522
- Well, they seem to think
you're pretty special.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.258
Which, of course,
I agree with.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.393
It's just that it's only
been, what, two shows?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.795
- Yeah, it's gotta be some
kind of record, huh?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.630
- Well, when you got it,
you got it.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.899
- You should definitely
do the interviews.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.501
- You guys took a chance on me
when I couldn't even get

03:20.534 --> 03:23.504
a write-up in Nashville Scene.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.374
Tell them they talk
to all of us or none of us.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.893
- Hey!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.661
- Hi!
- You made it!

03:47.695 --> 03:50.264
- Hello.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.499
- Dudes, come on!
- Hi, guys.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.500
- You gonna help her
grab her bags?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.701
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.603
- Jonah, this place
is so gorgeous.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.473
- Well, you just made it
twice as gorgeous, hmm?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.675
- Sorry, loves!

04:01.709 --> 04:02.976
I hate to break it up.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.413
But we gotta get
to sound check right now.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.847
- Okay.
- Well...

04:06.880 --> 04:09.016
- Come on.
- That means all of us.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.418
- Thank you.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.952
So what's Daphne
singing tonight?

04:11.985 --> 04:15.589
- She is singing the sweetest
little song she wrote.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.791
It's just so good.
What's Jake doing?

04:17.825 --> 04:19.460
- I actually have no clue

04:19.493 --> 04:21.462
because I haven't been
allowed to go anywhere

04:21.495 --> 04:23.331
near his room for
the last three days.

04:25.866 --> 04:29.036
- Welcome to
Langhorne Academy Open House.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.439
Please hold your applause
until after the performance.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.074
- Hey, you'll be all right.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.476
- Okay.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.980
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Daphne Conrad.

04:44.485 --> 04:49.490
- * Hey, concrete and steel

04:49.523 --> 04:53.394
* Don't like the lonely way *

04:53.427 --> 04:56.897
* The way I feel

04:56.930 --> 05:01.769
* And I'm trying to find
something real *

05:03.070 --> 05:06.607
* Dying to find
a place where I *

05:06.640 --> 05:10.043
* Where I can heal

05:10.077 --> 05:13.881
* All those ties
that bind me *

05:13.914 --> 05:17.385
* The past
that reminds me *

05:17.418 --> 05:22.656
* Gonna leave it
all behind me *

05:22.690 --> 05:27.661
* Down the long road
I travel *

05:29.697 --> 05:33.000
* Watch me unravel

05:34.702 --> 05:39.740
* Oh, undo my heart

05:41.475 --> 05:46.680
* Oh, my hardest part

05:58.592 --> 06:01.061
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Jake Maitland.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.901
- Come at me, bro,
but know your place!

06:07.935 --> 06:09.470
Don't exit hyperspace
so close to Hoth,

06:09.503 --> 06:10.771
the rebels' base

06:10.804 --> 06:13.173
A planet so cold,
ice covers its face

06:13.206 --> 06:15.175
'Cause I know a home
base that's colder

06:15.208 --> 06:17.811
Can't wait till I'm older,
give y'all the cold shoulder

06:17.845 --> 06:19.913
Gonna roll over
y'all like a boulder

06:19.947 --> 06:22.550
But there's no escape
this time, Indiana

06:22.583 --> 06:24.685
'Cause I'm Jonesing for
a different kind of idol

06:24.718 --> 06:26.820
Not the one I was given
all puffed up on fame

06:26.854 --> 06:30.991
The only thing I got from
you was my name, Maitland

06:31.024 --> 06:33.727
But that doesn't keep my
classmates from landing blows

06:33.761 --> 06:35.529
From my head to my toes

06:35.563 --> 06:37.698
This ain't the life I chose

06:37.731 --> 06:40.868
I'm a wildling,
y'all a bunch of crows!

06:54.081 --> 06:56.750
This is where Mommy was.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.452
It's called Bolivia.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.488
And we are right here.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.558
- Oh! Mommy's home!

07:04.592 --> 07:06.159
Mommy is home!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.496
You wanna hold
these flowers?

07:08.529 --> 07:09.663
Yeah?

07:09.697 --> 07:11.164
You wanna give 'em to Mommy?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.902
All right.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.837
Keep a lookout
for Mommy, Cadence.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.606
Here she comes.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.552
Hey, Bill, where is she?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.220
- No idea.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.922
We got a call when we were
there that she wasn't coming.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.223
I really thought
they would have called you.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.925
- No one called me.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.493
- Sorry. It must have
just been a mix-up.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.629
- Yeah, sorry.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.182
- Uh, she's not
picking up her phone.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.817
I don't even know
who to call.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.519
- I have friends.
Let me see what I can find out.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.720
- I just don't get it.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.121
I mean, why would
she not leave?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.189
Why wouldn't she call me?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.624
- Just stay calm.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.125
Let's not jump to
any conclusions.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.627
I'll call you back as soon
as I hear anything.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.729
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.501
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.046
- Movement for
Coherent Philosophy.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.281
How may I help you?

08:34.314 --> 08:36.784
- Yeah, hi.
This is Avery Barkley.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.052
I'm Juliette Barnes' husband.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.121
Do you know where she is?
- Sorry, Mr. Barkley.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.057
I'm afraid I can't divulge any
information about our members.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.026
- Look, you're either
gonna talk to me

08:46.059 --> 08:47.728
or you're gonna talk
to the police

08:47.761 --> 08:49.863
because the next call
I make is gonna be to them.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.999
- You have our assurance
that Ms. Barnes is safe here

08:52.032 --> 08:53.233
at our facility.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.234
- All right.
Then let me talk to her.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.036
Put her on.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.338
- Ms. Barnes is free to
contact you whenever she likes.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.875
- I'm afraid I don't know,
Mr. Barkley.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.677
- Just let me talk
to her now!

09:03.711 --> 09:07.147
- Ms. Barnes is free to contact
you whenever she likes.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.282
- You just told me that!

09:14.254 --> 09:15.823
- Oh, they're there.
- They're there! Hello!

09:15.856 --> 09:17.891
- Hey, you were good!
- Amazing!

09:17.925 --> 09:19.159
- Oh, you were so good.
- Oh, my goodness.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.828
I'm so proud of you!

09:20.861 --> 09:23.196
- Jake... That was just like...
- And you were amazing!

09:23.230 --> 09:25.198
- Something else, man.
Where'd you learn to do that?

09:25.232 --> 09:28.168
- Just YouTube mostly.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.972
- Well, if it isn't
Nashville's new favorite couple!

09:32.005 --> 09:36.043
Well, son, you
certainly, uh, did...

09:36.076 --> 09:37.945
whatever it is
you did up there.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.913
- I think it's called
"Spoken Word", right, babe?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.915
Brad Maitland.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.651
I'm this troublemaker's
father here.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.053
Hey, your performance today,
it moved me.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.388
It did.
It brought the wife to tears.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.823
I don't know what your
stepdad is doing

09:49.857 --> 09:51.191
keeping you in
school auditoriums.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.026
You deserve a real stage, girl.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.662
- Thank you.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.664
- I mean, you realize
she's a star, right?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.966
- If that's what she wants
to be, that's what she'll be.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.201
- I, on the other hand,
have no idea

10:01.234 --> 10:04.938
what to make of this here
rare talent.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.975
- Well, I think he was
amazing, incredible!

10:08.008 --> 10:09.376
- Yes!

10:09.409 --> 10:10.778
- Well, maybe you two
could make a duo, huh?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.012
Oh, I forgot.
That's right.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.013
You gave up performing
on my dime.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.148
Y'all have a good weekend.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.786
Hey! You!

10:18.819 --> 10:20.754
A star.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.394
- Just wait a second.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.395
Ta-da!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.131
- Not frozen anymore.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.933
- Oh. Wait, whoa.
Without syrup?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.368
Are you a critic?
Try them and shut up.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.405
- All right.
Wow!

10:38.438 --> 10:40.708
- Oh, ye of little faith.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.279
- You know, three months ago,
I never thought

10:46.313 --> 10:49.449
I'd be sitting in this bed
with somebody like you.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.885
Wonder what that means.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.754
- What are you thinking
right now?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.756
- That I'm hungry.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.227
- I'm gonna be thirsty when
I'm done being hungry.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.962
- Oh, come on.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.463
- We just had this
incredible night.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.767
We're eating frozen
waffles in bed.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.469
I mean, it's pretty
incredible, right?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.871
- Good.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.009
- I don't know.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.012
It's just... I feel like you
can take it or leave it.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.015
- What do you want,
Gunnar Scott?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.952
- I don't know.
To, uh--

11:24.985 --> 11:27.187
To get to know
you better, I guess.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.089
- An open book, am I.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.390
- Okay. Why'd you
join the band?

11:30.423 --> 11:33.326
- To sing.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.096
- 'Cause it's not talking
like we're doing right now.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.067
- Oh, saved by the bell.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.203
You're very handsome.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.938
You know that?

11:51.111 --> 11:53.781
- Oh, that's my ex.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.715
I'll... I'll just be a second.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.722
(cheering, shouting,
police sirens chirps)

12:05.893 --> 12:07.327
- Tonight's gonna be crazy.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.528
- I don't know how
you deal with this.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.063
This would totally
freak me out.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.032
- I don't even
notice it anymore.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.940
Okay.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.945
- Yeah, right.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.780
- Hey! Hey!

12:26.814 --> 12:28.481
Hey!

12:28.515 --> 12:31.251
Toyota's gonna wanna get this
car back in one piece, okay?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.299
- This next song is
a new one.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.068
It requires a special guest.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.573
- * When you're out
in the cold *

12:53.606 --> 12:55.408
* Then get thrown
to the flames *

12:55.442 --> 12:57.077
* When a moment
feels good *

12:57.110 --> 12:58.812
- * But it ends in pain

12:58.846 --> 13:00.413
- * When you wanna get out

13:00.447 --> 13:02.415
* And you're done
with the games *

13:02.449 --> 13:05.585
- * Oh, no

13:05.618 --> 13:07.054
- * When you're losing it all *

13:07.087 --> 13:09.089
* Over some bad advice

13:09.122 --> 13:12.359
* Yeah I've seen it before *
- * Maybe once or twice

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
- * At the end of your rope

13:14.161 --> 13:15.929
* I look up to the sky

13:15.963 --> 13:19.032
* And I pray you stay alive

13:19.066 --> 13:22.269
- * After the smoke is gone

13:22.302 --> 13:26.907
* I open my eyes
and I see you *

13:29.076 --> 13:33.513
- * I'm tired of this fight
to get us through *

13:33.546 --> 13:35.315
* When our world
starts to change *

13:38.051 --> 13:40.320
* Will you feel the same?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.322
* I'll be there for you *

13:42.355 --> 13:46.459
* As long as you're
right there too *

13:46.493 --> 13:48.962
* I'll be there for you *

13:48.996 --> 13:50.530
- * Take my word

13:50.563 --> 13:52.565
* You know
I'll follow through *

14:03.243 --> 14:05.278
- It's just so infuriating!

14:05.312 --> 14:07.314
How could she just
disappear on us again?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.515
Like it was nothing?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.051
I'm sorry.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.152
I didn't mean to put
all this on you.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.054
- Avery, please, come on now.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.155
You said you were
worried about her.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.924
I told you not to be.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.425
Is there anything I can do?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.893
- I don't know.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.461
I mean, is there
anything anybody can do?

14:21.494 --> 14:25.365
It's not like I can call
the CIA and have her kidnapped.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.434
- Might be worth a shot.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.369
- No. She'll come back
when she feels like it

14:29.402 --> 14:32.172
which is how
she does everything.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.440
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.009
Hey, how's Juliette?

14:37.978 --> 14:42.382
- She decided to extend
her trip for a few days.

14:42.415 --> 14:47.120
- So, Alannah, you're a virtual
unknown in the business.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.256
Where the heck
did you come from?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.292
- Oregon, originally,
but I roamed around a bit

14:52.325 --> 14:54.427
before I found
my way to Nashville.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.697
- Yeah.
A lot of hitchhiking.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.168
Even a little freight hopping.
- Ah.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.537
- And how were these gentlemen
lucky enough to find you?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.374
- Let's be clear.
I was the lucky one.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.180
- Hey, thanks again, man.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.982
We're lucky to get
a little publicity

15:15.015 --> 15:16.383
from this experiment of ours.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.952
- Well, I can't say
I much like the guy.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.087
But when Brad Maitland
calls me in

15:20.120 --> 15:21.488
the middle of the night
and says

15:21.521 --> 15:26.159
he's found the next
big thing, I listen.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.627
Bye-bye.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.568
- It's not her fault
Brad called reporters.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.470
We're not maligning her.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.406
- Besides, I think
she did great in there.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.141
- Hey, I got an idea.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.076
Why don't we talk about
something over than Alannah?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.978
- Yeah. Maybe it's good for
our egos to be bruised

15:45.012 --> 15:46.279
every once in a while.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.614
- Yeah, it's good press
for the band.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.416
That's the problem.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.583
What band?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.154
- I mean, I thought we
started this whole thing

15:54.187 --> 15:55.555
so the three of us
could hang out.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.557
Have some fun, make music
we wanna make

15:57.590 --> 15:59.659
without worrying about
what anybody said.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.761
It wasn't supposed to be some
sort of business venture.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.264
Then we bring in Alannah
who's talented as hell.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.434
But it just feels like
this whole thing is...

16:07.467 --> 16:09.036
becoming exactly what
we didn't want it to be.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.371
- Oh, a successful band.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.639
- A job.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.141
- Well, we're neither
right now.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.542
Because both require it
making some money.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.344
- Look, we all know
you're compromised.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.346
So how about we ask Switzerland
over here to weigh in?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.615
- I agree with Will.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.618
First priority should be
staying true to ourselves.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.521
But when you stumble across
a real talent like Alannah,

16:28.555 --> 16:30.323
I mean, who knows?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.759
We may be on the verge of
something truly special here.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.762
- Here, I thought we already
had something special.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.429
- Yeah, let me have one day.
Let me have one day.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.497
- Hey.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.066
Coffee?
It is freshly brewed.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.601
- Sure. Thank you.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.602
- Oh, you don't
have to whisper.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.137
Don't worry.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.705
He can literally sleep
through anything.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.108
I'm pretty sure 10,000
screaming 14-year-old girls

17:21.141 --> 17:22.209
couldn't wake him up,
so you're good.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.510
- No, no...
- Yeah, watch.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.445
Hey, Dan!
Hey, Dan!

17:25.478 --> 17:26.746
- Shh. Stop it.
- Nothing.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.218
- Hey, I have a
question for you.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.386
Have you ever been to Denver?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.822
- Yes. One time, my Mom had
a big concert there.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.424
- Sorry.
You're supposed to say "no".

17:37.457 --> 17:39.159
So then I can say,

17:39.192 --> 17:41.794
"Well, I am
bringing Denver to you."

17:41.828 --> 17:43.396
Because I'm making you
a Denver omelet.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.664
- Okay. I've never been.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.665
- That was the joke...
okay, good.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.167
- I've never been...

17:47.200 --> 17:48.435
- Well, I'm bringing
Denver to you.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.702
That's good.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.138
- Good morning.
- Look who's awake.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.305
Did you sleep okay?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.606
- Like a baby.
- Good.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.244
Because I'm dying
to go on that jet ski.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.645
- And you should.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.113
What...

18:00.147 --> 18:01.648
- Well, it's awesome,
actually.

18:01.681 --> 18:05.218
Richard Linklater's thinking
of me for his next film.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.687
But to even have a chance,
I have to fly to Austin

18:07.720 --> 18:09.689
right now to read for him.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.160
- That's amazing.
That's awesome.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.162
So, should we go to
the airport together or...

18:15.195 --> 18:16.429
- No, no, no.
You're staying here.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.265
The guy's will
take care of you.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.699
And Twig will make sure that
they behave themselves, right?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.434
- Yeah. We'll turn up.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.204
Come on, we don't need him.
Let this loser go work.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.238
We'll have fun.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.608
I'm gonna get this role.

18:28.641 --> 18:32.179
And you're gonna get a tan.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.713
And I'll be back
tomorrow, okay?

18:33.746 --> 18:34.847
I promise.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.217
- I hate you.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.718
- I hate me.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.353
I'm sorry, okay?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.557
I should pack my stuff.
- Okay.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.371
- I cannot believe you're
still reading that book.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.173
- I'm absorbing it.

19:03.776 --> 19:04.811
- Oh.

19:04.844 --> 19:05.812
- Country music newest--

19:07.314 --> 19:10.917
- Oh, some country
music competition.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.385
- Like "American Idol"
kind of thing?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.587
- I guess so.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.456
"Nashville's
Next country star."

19:16.489 --> 19:17.557
- Yeah, that's Brad's thing.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.959
And it is sure
to be a cluster.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.694
Good thing you ain't gonna
have nothin' to do with it.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.699
Anyway, baby, you're not
gonna need anything

19:26.733 --> 19:28.501
like that to show how
much talent you got.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.970
Because I get solos
in the school choir?

19:31.003 --> 19:34.574
- Sweetheart, you know
we got big plans for you, right?

19:34.607 --> 19:35.775
As soon as
you're ready, right?

19:35.808 --> 19:37.277
- Yeah, I know, I know.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.378
- You're gonna take off
like a rocket.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.912
- I know.
- You are.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.788
- Hey, buddy!

19:48.821 --> 19:52.259
- Well, hello to you too.
Make yourself at home.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.760
- Bro night.
You and me.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.662
Where's Alannah?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.498
- I'm offended you'd assume
that eating pizza

19:58.531 --> 20:00.267
and drinking beer was
not my first choice

20:00.300 --> 20:01.534
of activities
of the evening.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.541
I mean, she's just going
to dinner, right?

20:08.575 --> 20:09.542
Should that take four hours?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.378
- Come on, man.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.980
You have friends who are exes?
I have friends who are exes.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.915
- That you'd have
four

20:15.948 --> 20:17.350
I'm gonna call her.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.486
- Gunnar.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.020
Gunnar!

20:21.053 --> 20:22.422
You told me you're
not in a relationship.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.723
- I'm not.

20:23.756 --> 20:24.791
- You only had sex
with her two times.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.493
- Three times.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.295
- There is no world in which
calling her right now

20:28.328 --> 20:29.862
is gonna help your cause.
Trust me.

20:29.896 --> 20:34.701
- No. You're right.
I'm just being crazy.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.935
You know, I don't think
it's such a big deal,

20:35.968 --> 20:37.003
just one call.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.938
- Do whatever you want, man.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.479
- Interesting question.

20:46.513 --> 20:50.317
My wife, ex-wife,
mother of my child,

20:50.350 --> 20:52.452
reason for drawing breath,

20:52.485 --> 20:55.021
isn't returning
my calls either.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.323
- Didn't you say she's
just extending her trip

20:56.356 --> 20:57.957
by a few days?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.727
- The truth is, I have no idea.
Because I can't reach her.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.462
I don't know who she's with,

21:02.495 --> 21:04.597
when she's coming back,
if she's coming back.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.433
I don't know anything.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.736
- It's crazy even
for Juliette.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.770
What are you gonna do?

21:16.909 --> 21:18.611
- You are so bad at this game!

21:18.645 --> 21:20.880
- I do not understand games
that involve slapping.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.649
It doesn't make
any sense to me.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.918
- All right,
it's speed and dexterity.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.489
I'm gonna remain
deliberate and clumsy.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.558
- Okay.
- Boy, boy, boy!

21:31.591 --> 21:32.759
- Wait'll you see what we got.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.364
- You might even say
they're magical.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.831
- Yeah, I'll pass.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.000
- Okay. Well, you can be
sober patrol then.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.802
How about you, Twiggles?
You in?

21:42.835 --> 21:46.373
- No. I am actually becoming
an expert at this card game.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.640
So I gotta stay focused.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.342
- You are such a bitch.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.110
Look, there's nothin' to it.
Boom!

21:51.143 --> 21:53.045
- Exactly.
- Simple.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.113
- Come on, Twig.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.815
Twiggy, Twiggy, Twiggy.

21:55.848 --> 21:56.816
They're all natural.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.451
- Yep, so's arsenic.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.952
So let's get some of
that going in here.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.022
- Twig's scared because
he's never tripped before.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.123
- Yeah, dude, you're
like a bad actor

22:04.156 --> 22:05.758
playing a bully
in an 80s movie.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.793
It's not working.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.629
- I'm just saying how do
you know that

22:09.662 --> 22:10.630
you won't like it
unless you try it?

22:10.663 --> 22:13.065
- Twig, don't.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.567
- I'm not.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.968
- Twig, don't.
Twig, don't.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.571
Twig, don't.
Twig, don't.

22:18.605 --> 22:19.672
Twiggy, Twiggy, Twiggy?

22:19.706 --> 22:21.040
- That's not annoying at all.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.675
- Twiggy, Twiggy,
Twiggy, Twig, don't!

22:22.709 --> 22:25.077
It's fine, it's fine.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.647
- Twig did!

22:27.680 --> 22:29.416
Twig did!
Twig did!

22:29.449 --> 22:31.818
- Twig did! Twig did!
Twig did!

22:31.851 --> 22:33.453
- Stop.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.488
- Twiggy, Twiggy,
Twiggy Twig did!

22:38.691 --> 22:40.059
- Yeah.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.093
That's nice.
- It's cool, man.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.863
How's my favorite new band?

22:43.896 --> 22:46.098
- Doing good, man.
It's gonna be a great show.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.734
Looks like we're a man down.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.135
- Yeah, well,
he'll sulk his way here.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.737
- Yeah.

22:50.770 --> 22:51.971
- Don't mind if I steal
this one real quick?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.806
- Oh, sure.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.949
- So, uh, what were you up
to last night?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.684
- I told you.
I was with my ex.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.788
- I don't see how that's
any of your business.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.691
- Huh.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.627
- Well, you told me you weren't
interested in anything serious.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.996
- Yeah, I guess I did
say that, didn't I?

23:17.029 --> 23:18.965
- So there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.107
- I don't have to answer that.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.578
- Because questions
like that don't fall

23:31.611 --> 23:33.846
into the parameters of
relationships like this.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.451
- What exactly is
this relationship?

23:38.485 --> 23:40.920
- I joined this band because
it allows me

23:40.953 --> 23:43.790
to do something that makes me
feel totally free.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.092
Stand in front of
a microphone, and sing.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.596
If your unfounded jealousy is
gonna get in the way of that,

23:49.629 --> 23:51.931
maybe I need to find
another place to do it.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.104
You need to find
yourself a hobby, Gunnar.

24:01.574 --> 24:02.875
Come on.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.143
You think they have any
whiskey around here?

24:06.746 --> 24:07.947
- For a while there,
it did seem like

24:07.980 --> 24:09.215
she was making progress,
though, right?

24:09.248 --> 24:11.017
- Well, so much for that.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.519
And you know
she's down there?

24:12.552 --> 24:14.621
She just won't talk to you?

24:14.654 --> 24:15.622
- Nope.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.491
And I love her, God help me.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.759
And Cadence needs her.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.561
But how can I let
this happen again?

24:21.594 --> 24:23.730
- Listen, Avery, if you're
tired of waiting for her,

24:23.763 --> 24:25.031
why don't you
just go get her?

24:25.064 --> 24:28.167
- Just pick up and
fly to Bolivia?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.471
- Yeah.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.112
- Y'all ready to do
this or what?

24:50.857 --> 24:53.059
- Whoa.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.200
- I can literally see
the outline of your skull.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.902
I think I saw you
in a comic book once.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.840
- Hi, Maddie.
Twig?

25:07.874 --> 25:09.909
Twig?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.545
Twig?

25:12.579 --> 25:13.980
Are you okay?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.215
- Here you go!

25:16.248 --> 25:17.750
- Guys, what's wrong
with him?

25:17.784 --> 25:19.619
- Nothing.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.787
- He's trippin'.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.189
- He's just trippin'.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.692
What's funny?

25:25.725 --> 25:26.859
- You are, stupid.

25:27.927 --> 25:28.928
- Please stop, stop laughing.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.564
- Stop. Stop!

25:31.598 --> 25:32.965
- I'm asking you
to stop laughing!

25:32.999 --> 25:35.802
Stop laughing!

25:35.835 --> 25:37.236
- No, no, no, no. Stop.
- Twig, it's okay.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.839
- Stop! Stop it!
I'm asking you to stop laughing!

25:39.872 --> 25:42.074
Stop! Stop!

25:43.676 --> 25:45.144
- Nothing, he's fine.
It'll wear off.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.846
- I don't like this!

25:46.879 --> 25:48.080
I don't, I don't,
I don't like this!

25:48.114 --> 25:49.181
- It's okay.
It's okay.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.817
- Dude! Relax!
Calm down, man.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.251
- No, I can't.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.987
- You're ruining it
for everyone.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.856
- Stop! Stop!

25:56.889 --> 25:58.290
Twig, just come here,
it's okay.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.092
Just come with me, okay?

26:03.262 --> 26:04.697
Okay.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.232
Just breathe with me, okay?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.566
In.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.036
Out.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.773
Do you feel any better?

26:13.806 --> 26:16.108
- No.
- No.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.143
- Okay, it's gonna
be over soon.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.180
- Like three to four hours.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.815
- Oh, my God.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.684
- It's okay.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.253
I'll be right here with
you the whole time, okay?

26:27.286 --> 26:28.788
- Okay. Thank you.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.990
- Yeah.
Okay, in.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.694
Out.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.167
- Hey!
- Hey, yourself.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.902
- Come on in.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.904
- We're running
a little bit late.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.005
You think maybe we can
grab something on the way,

26:46.038 --> 26:47.173
if you want?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.908
- Sorry.
I'm not at all ready.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.943
Are you okay with
mac and cheese for dinner?

26:50.977 --> 26:52.111
Not that you have
any other options.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.680
- Please.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.114
First two years in town,
that's all I ate.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.348
- Oh, good.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.884
Hey, Jake! Dinner!

26:57.917 --> 26:59.285
- I'm right here.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.787
- All right, 'cause
your dad just called

27:00.820 --> 27:02.889
and informed me that
he ordered an Uber

27:02.922 --> 27:04.791
and it is going to be
here very shortly.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.825
Are you all packed?

27:05.858 --> 27:06.993
- No.

27:07.026 --> 27:10.029
Jake, I asked...

27:10.062 --> 27:12.331
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna pack.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.166
You eat.
Can you...

27:14.200 --> 27:15.702
- I got it.
I'll serve it up.

27:15.735 --> 27:19.405
All right, come and get it.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.877
I wanted to tell you again how
much I enjoyed your performance.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.679
- Yeah.

27:26.713 --> 27:30.049
- I mean, you said it was
"really something".

27:30.082 --> 27:31.918
Figured that meant
you hated it.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.119
- Nope.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.320
Meant it was
really something.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.123
It was great.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.091
To be honest, I'm not
smart or cool enough

27:39.125 --> 27:41.093
to really understand
the medium all that well.

27:41.127 --> 27:45.431
But the words you said,
the heart behind it.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.200
Cut right through me.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.402
You know, my dad
was a tough one.

27:50.436 --> 27:53.039
He told me that I would
never be able to make it

27:53.072 --> 27:55.708
in the music business.
He said I was no good.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.309
Nothing was gonna come of it.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.378
The worst part is,
I believed him sometimes.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.048
Let him get to me so much
that I sort of

28:02.081 --> 28:05.684
inherited some of
his worst traits.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.721
Fell into his trap, you know.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.422
Took me a long time
before I finally realized

28:10.456 --> 28:12.725
that he was wrong.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.827
I was worth something.

28:18.430 --> 28:22.201
I know the other night,
your work,

28:22.234 --> 28:24.403
it just showed real honesty.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.073
You feel things deeply
and that can be hard, but...

28:30.142 --> 28:32.879
it's worth it.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.081
It's a gift.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.715
You keep doin'
what you're doin'.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.456
- I love you, sweetie.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.028
- I'll see you later.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.297
- Look forward to it.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.842
Mm, we gotta hurry.
We're gonna miss the show.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.311
- We're gonna miss the show.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.825
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.846
- * I was born at the end
of an old dirt road *

29:42.114 --> 29:45.151
* Before I could walk,
I was ready to roll *

29:47.186 --> 29:50.789
- * When I turned 16,
my brother threw me the key *

29:52.524 --> 29:55.527
- * He said, hey, little sister,
better watch your speed *

29:55.561 --> 29:57.897
- * Now I'm smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

29:57.930 --> 30:00.366
- * Takin' a drag and
I'm makin' some noise *

30:00.399 --> 30:03.870
- * I'm smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

30:03.903 --> 30:05.471
- * Ooh, smoking the boys

30:05.504 --> 30:06.906
* Come on

30:06.939 --> 30:08.841
* Get the motor running,
baby *

30:08.875 --> 30:11.043
* Four, Don't let
the trannie pop know *

30:11.077 --> 30:13.545
* Three, you got to feel it
in your fingers *

30:13.579 --> 30:16.082
* Two, come on,
get ready to rock, come on *

30:16.115 --> 30:17.083
* One, go
- * Go

30:17.116 --> 30:19.151
- * Go
- * Go

30:29.561 --> 30:31.964
- * Smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

30:31.998 --> 30:34.333
- * Takin' a drag and
makin' some noise *

30:34.366 --> 30:37.236
- * I'm smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

30:38.370 --> 30:40.106
- * Smokin' the boys *

30:40.139 --> 30:42.341
- * Smokin' the boys,
smokin' the boys *

30:42.374 --> 30:44.877
- * Takin' a drag and
I'm makin' some noise *

30:44.911 --> 30:48.314
- * I'm smokin' the boys,
smokin the boys *

30:48.347 --> 30:50.582
- * Yeah, smokin' the boys! *

30:53.119 --> 30:55.121
- Woo! Yeah!

30:59.458 --> 31:02.028
- Um... Well...

31:02.061 --> 31:05.131
I'm only in a
total state of panic.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.033
So I must be doing better.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.935
- Good.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.569
- I'm really sorry that you
had to see me that way.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.438
- Oh, don't be sorry.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.640
It says that heightened anxiety
is really common.

31:14.673 --> 31:15.942
Especially if you're
already worried

31:15.975 --> 31:17.910
about something
to begin with.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.511
- Oh, that's weird 'cause
I never worry about anything.

31:19.545 --> 31:23.315
- Oh, my gosh, you still
have orange stuff...

31:23.349 --> 31:26.919
- I can't stand not
being in control.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.922
I mean, actually, I want to
be able to just like let go

31:29.956 --> 31:31.991
and not worry about anything.
- Yeah.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.927
- But, you know, I'm worried
that no one's gonna step up

31:34.961 --> 31:36.228
and be the responsible one.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.964
- Yeah.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.299
- Yeah.
- But I also, uh...

31:44.070 --> 31:45.437
Come on.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.672
The whole world knows
I have two dads

31:46.705 --> 31:48.507
and a famous mom who died.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.942
What's your story?

31:49.976 --> 31:51.210
- Yeah, I'm sorry
about your mom.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.945
- Thank you.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.413
- My mom's sort of alive.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.217
- Aw, she's just
always had issues.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.651
After my dad peaced out,

31:59.685 --> 32:03.089
she just basically got
super depressed

32:03.122 --> 32:07.159
and like was kind of
useless as a parent.

32:07.193 --> 32:11.230
So it kind of fell on me
to take care of

32:11.263 --> 32:12.631
my brother and sister.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.200
- I'm sorry.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.036
- Yeah, so like she was
always super paranoid

32:17.069 --> 32:19.671
that Child Protective Services
would take us away from her.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.474
So she was on me to make sure
everyone was always okay.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.575
- That's so unfair.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.611
- Kind of helped me grow up.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.645
Do the stuff I can do now.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.314
Like what?

32:28.347 --> 32:30.416
- Just like figure out
the logistics for the crew

32:30.449 --> 32:32.351
and like hang out
with producers

32:32.384 --> 32:33.385
and see what they do.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.721
- No.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.524
I mean, I do stupid stuff
on my laptop.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.459
- Well, you should show me
some of your stupid stuff.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.261
- Oh, yeah, okay, sure.
- Yeah.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.363
- Hey, when I think of
something that doesn't suck,

32:44.396 --> 32:46.198
I'll let you know.
How's that?

33:05.284 --> 33:07.386
- Thank you, Nashville!
Goodnight!

33:09.821 --> 33:12.591
Woo! Yeah!

33:16.528 --> 33:18.697
- Great show, guys!
See you around.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.599
- Okay, bye.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.035
And there she goes again.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.604
Going home, to her ex-boyfriend,
to an underground rave.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.173
Who knows?

33:27.206 --> 33:30.576
- Or more accurately,
who cares?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.144
- Is that really
necessary, man?

33:32.178 --> 33:33.612
- Yeah. I think it is.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.414
I'm riding high off
of a good show

33:35.447 --> 33:38.184
and your pining is coming
dangerously close to ruining it.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.751
- Oh, yeah.
Bet you had a great show.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.454
- You hijacked Alannah's
performance on like every song.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.623
- Oh, I hijacked
Alannah's part?

33:44.656 --> 33:45.757
- Yeah.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.226
- She hijacked
our entire band.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.560
- Guys, can we not do
this tonight?

33:48.594 --> 33:50.162
- Why is it so hard
for you to recognize

33:50.196 --> 33:51.597
that she's been nothing
but great for the band?

33:51.630 --> 33:53.499
- I thought we were
pretty great without her!

33:53.532 --> 33:55.801
And don't think I don't know
what this is really about.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.603
- Okay. Well, what is
this really about?

33:57.636 --> 33:59.805
- You're afraid to be
fronted by Will Lexington,

33:59.838 --> 34:01.407
the gay cowboy.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.675
Like this is gonna be
some sort of gay band.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.145
Like the country version
of The Village People.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.080
- Oh, my God!
Are you crazy, man?

34:08.114 --> 34:10.216
- Guys!

34:10.249 --> 34:11.783
I can't do this
right now, okay?

34:11.817 --> 34:13.452
My wife's missing,

34:13.485 --> 34:14.720
I'm flying to Bolivia
at six in the morning!

34:16.622 --> 34:19.591
- With any luck, I'll be back
in 48 hours with Juliette.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.613
- Hi. I'm here to
see Juliette Barnes.

35:14.646 --> 35:15.847
- Okay.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.650
I'm sorry, sir.

35:18.684 --> 35:19.851
I'm not seeing an
appointment listed...

35:19.885 --> 35:21.520
- She's my wife.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.422
- Sir, this is
a private campus.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.191
I can't let you inside.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.725
- Okay, then bring
her out here.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.462
You will have to leave,
make an appointment...

35:30.496 --> 35:32.198
- Listen to me!

35:32.231 --> 35:34.166
I will see my wife!

35:34.200 --> 35:36.568
And I'm not leaving
this room until I do!

35:36.602 --> 35:38.437
- Excuse me.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.709
- My name's Avery Barkley.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.748
- Hey.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.517
- Hey, good morning.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.485
- Mm-hmm.
It's afternoon actually.

35:53.519 --> 35:57.523
- Yeah, you're right.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.559
Look, I'm sorry about
last night.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.394
Again, that was really
not cool of me.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.230
- Don't be, seriously.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.598
Bathroom floors are kind of
like my preferred hangout spot

36:06.632 --> 36:08.400
for Saturday night, so...
- Oh! That's good, that's good.

36:10.269 --> 36:13.839
- And, honestly, you were cute
when you were freaking out.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.674
- Well, hey,
I'll tell you what.

36:15.707 --> 36:19.511
Next time I freak out, you
can be the first person I call.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.680
How's that sound?
- Yes. Amazing, awesome.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.649
- I actually realized that
I don't even have your number.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.816
- Yeah, you don't.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.353
- Hey!
- Hey, you're back!

36:27.386 --> 36:28.920
How was it?
Did you get the part?

36:28.954 --> 36:31.357
- I don't know.
Hopefully, we'll see.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.591
How you doing?

36:32.624 --> 36:34.260
How's your day?

36:34.293 --> 36:35.961
- It's good.
I'm bummed.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.363
I missed out on
the weekend with you.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.997
- Well, there are more weekends.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.367
And, honestly,
you didn't miss much.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.802
- Well, I will make it
up to you.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.537
- Yes, I will.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.673
Name a country and
we'll go there.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.275
- You are so ridiculous.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.777
- Yes.
- Oh, okay

37:05.491 --> 37:06.858
- Guess I figured
after yesterday,

37:06.892 --> 37:11.597
you were kind of done
with me or something.

37:11.630 --> 37:12.898
- Well, that's stupid.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.851
- Follow him, please.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.745
Why didn't you
answer my calls?

38:33.779 --> 38:36.348
- Sorry. I couldn't.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.616
- What, did they
take your phone away?

38:37.649 --> 38:40.085
- No, nothing like that.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.989
You're not acting
like yourself.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.791
- You're right.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.026
I'm not the person I was.

38:48.059 --> 38:53.732
But I'm more myself than
I've ever been in my life.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.001
- Juliette, what...

38:56.034 --> 38:57.903
what does that even mean?

38:57.936 --> 39:01.773
- It means that I've lived my
whole life for other people.

39:01.807 --> 39:05.544
And for the first time,
I'm doing it on my own terms.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.078
- That's crazy.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.880
You've always lived your life
on your own terms.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.616
You never gave a damn
what anyone else thought!

39:10.649 --> 39:12.884
- I understand why you think
that, but you're wrong.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.424
I needed people too much.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.826
I had to control everything.

39:20.859 --> 39:24.530
Because I was afraid if
I didn't, I would be erased.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.999
- Okay, so we'll
deal with that.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.134
- You're part of the problem.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.836
You and everybody else.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.571
But I don't blame you.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.440
You didn't know
what you were doing.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.943
But you had a stake in
keeping me the way I was.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.110
- That is insane.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.514
- And I knew you
would say that.

39:42.548 --> 39:45.451
And that's why
I can't be with you.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.420
Why I can't have anything
to do with my old life

39:48.454 --> 39:53.959
until I learn how to fill this
hole in my heart on my own.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.994
Not from the outside.

39:56.027 --> 40:01.733
- Okay, this place
is bad for you.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.001
And we're gonna leave.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.736
Come on.
We're gonna get your stuff.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.605
I'm taking you to the airport.
- No!

40:06.638 --> 40:07.873
- You're gonna come home!
- No, Avery!

40:07.906 --> 40:09.841
You're not listening to me!

40:09.875 --> 40:11.843
I'm not coming home.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.051
- Cadence can come
and live with me

40:20.085 --> 40:21.720
as long as I'm down here.

40:22.788 --> 40:23.755
- Yes.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.525
- Yes.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.760
Why is that any different
from her being with you?

40:28.794 --> 40:31.530
- That is not an option!

40:31.563 --> 40:32.964
- Fine.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.867
Then I will FaceTime
her every day.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.235
I am still her mother.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.505
I am not abandoning her
in any way.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.906
She's not the problem.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.175
- I am.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.745
- You are not the problem.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.780
I am.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.850
And I can't communicate
with you or anybody else

40:51.883 --> 40:53.619
until I can change that.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.924
- Juliette, you and I
have been through

40:58.957 --> 41:02.794
everything together,
everything!

41:02.828 --> 41:04.763
I came down here
because I am very,

41:04.796 --> 41:06.765
very worried about you.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.967
And I don't wanna lose you.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.936
Please listen to me right now.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.104
I love you.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.241
I need you to come home, okay?

41:16.274 --> 41:18.644
Come back with me, please.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.123
- I've already
made my decision.
