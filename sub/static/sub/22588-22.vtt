03:06.781 --> 03:08.681
What's so funny, Penguin?

03:08.683 --> 03:09.915
Oh, the irony of it.

03:10.317 --> 03:14.052
- The exquisite humor.
- Where's our check?

03:14.054 --> 03:16.421
The 1000 bucks
for the police benevolent fund.

03:16.423 --> 03:20.191
Yes, with my gratitude,
you've earned it.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.458
It's certified.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.158
Holy Hot Foot!

03:22.160 --> 03:24.894
The bulletproof soles of our
shoes sure saved our lives.

03:24.896 --> 03:28.497
The shock has luckily unjammed
my Bat-knife too.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.199
I'll cut these ropes.

03:31.201 --> 03:34.068
We'll get out of here fast.

03:34.402 --> 03:35.034
Unh!

03:35.036 --> 03:38.771
You know, it's quite a recoil
for a pop gun.

03:38.773 --> 03:41.974
You're right, Chief O'Hara.
I noticed that myself.

03:41.976 --> 03:43.542
Hmm.

03:43.544 --> 03:46.278
Now, let's toss
the costume corpses

03:46.280 --> 03:50.849
over the pier.
To the sharks with them.

03:53.519 --> 03:55.953
Great blubbering whale oil!

03:55.955 --> 03:57.321
They've evaporated!

03:57.323 --> 04:00.324
Slugged me
when I wasn't lookin'.

04:00.326 --> 04:02.326
Batarangs!

04:04.495 --> 04:06.262
Curses! Curses!

04:06.264 --> 04:09.865
Now, we'll have
to fight another round.

04:10.533 --> 04:11.766
Gosh, Batman!

04:11.768 --> 04:15.970
I still think we should've
crashed in and caged that bird.

04:15.972 --> 04:17.971
On what charge?

04:17.974 --> 04:19.707
Attempted murder.

04:19.709 --> 04:23.610
Commissioner Gordon and
Chief O'Hara fired the guns.

04:23.612 --> 04:24.944
Ouch. Yes.

04:24.946 --> 04:26.011
We're the fugitives.

04:26.013 --> 04:27.912
We are wanted
by the law for burglary.

04:27.914 --> 04:32.516
Besides, The Penguin had legally
rented that amusement pier.

04:32.518 --> 04:35.685
- We are the trespassers.
- Holy Nightmare!

04:35.687 --> 04:38.521
In this game,
Penguin holds all the aces.

04:38.523 --> 04:42.024
He may be holding all the aces

04:42.026 --> 04:46.695
but tomorrow morning
we play the trump card.

04:48.964 --> 04:53.067
Those masked menaces
must be apprehended.

04:53.069 --> 04:54.334
I won't stand for it.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.268
A civil tongue, Penguin

04:55.270 --> 04:57.403
or I'll have you removed
from my office.

04:57.405 --> 05:00.239
A civil tongue, is it?
You watch out!

05:00.241 --> 05:03.809
I'll have you removed
from <i> your</i> office.

05:03.811 --> 05:04.276
What?

05:04.278 --> 05:07.245
My influential friends
won't like this.

05:07.247 --> 05:08.813
They'll have you thrown back

05:08.815 --> 05:10.915
into the department
of sanitation

05:10.917 --> 05:15.085
where you belong
for harboring wanted criminals.

05:15.087 --> 05:16.920
An outrageous accusation.

05:16.922 --> 05:20.890
Open your yap, Penguin.
Make that charge again.

05:20.892 --> 05:22.725
I'm afraid, Penguin's right.

05:22.727 --> 05:24.126
My dear Miss Starr!

05:24.128 --> 05:28.964
Do you pretend you can't find
these criminals, commissioner?

05:29.198 --> 05:30.231
What's the matter, commissioner?

05:30.233 --> 05:32.233
Your famous hotline
out of order?

05:32.235 --> 05:35.402
Penguin, don't touch that phone!

05:38.237 --> 05:40.838
- Yes, commissioner.
- Quack, quack!

05:40.840 --> 05:41.905
I'm on the track.

05:41.907 --> 05:45.675
- Penguin!
- No answer, eh? Hmm?

05:45.677 --> 05:48.010
The heat is on, Batman.
You'd better come in.

05:48.012 --> 05:50.178
And give yourself up
on that burglary charge.

05:50.180 --> 05:53.080
Instantly.
Do you understand?

05:53.082 --> 05:54.014
I'll see you, Penguin.

05:54.016 --> 05:58.284
I'll be at your Protective
Agency Office in 25 minutes.

05:58.286 --> 06:02.388
Did you hear that?
He's on his way to attack me.

06:02.390 --> 06:05.023
I demand protection.

06:05.357 --> 06:09.193
Penguin is within his rights,
Chief O'Hara.

06:09.195 --> 06:11.295
Stake out the area.

06:11.297 --> 06:13.463
Arrest Batman.

06:13.465 --> 06:14.997
Yes, sir.

06:20.770 --> 06:24.239
Get on the mobile Bat-phone.
Call Commissioner Gordon.

06:24.241 --> 06:25.039
Roger.

06:25.041 --> 06:28.909
Give him
the following instructions.

06:46.160 --> 06:51.264
Come on, my fine frosty finks.
Batman's on his way.

07:03.610 --> 07:04.276
Rargh!

07:04.278 --> 07:08.079
Well, the costumed crooks!
The dressed-up desperadoes!

07:08.081 --> 07:11.615
Your super brain power
has driven us mad, Penguin!

07:11.617 --> 07:12.382
Something snapped!

07:12.384 --> 07:16.185
'We don't care if we go up
the river for a hundred years.'

07:16.187 --> 07:18.687
- 'We're getting you first!!'
- Quick, my finks! Self-defense!

07:18.689 --> 07:22.624
The dynamic duo
has flipped their wigs!

07:52.786 --> 07:55.254
Batman, listen! The police!

07:56.857 --> 07:59.624
Let's get out of here.

08:15.306 --> 08:18.808
Surrender, Batman!
We're taking you in.

08:33.385 --> 08:35.687
Get 'em, coppers!

09:09.985 --> 09:14.788
Oh, frabjous day!
Callooh! Callay!

09:14.790 --> 09:16.823
Let's bag the Batmobile.

09:16.825 --> 09:20.159
Sensational idea! Come on!

09:30.970 --> 09:34.238
Let's see now. How do you run
this dratted thing?

09:51.455 --> 09:53.355
I'll call the morgue.

09:53.357 --> 09:58.326
Don't feel too sad, boys.
You had to do it.

09:58.328 --> 09:59.561
There's nothin' so tragic

09:59.563 --> 10:03.565
as a good crime fighter
turned bad.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.674
In view of their past services,
I've given orders

10:13.676 --> 10:16.276
that they be buried
with full police honors.

10:16.278 --> 10:18.978
Despite the fact
they died as fugitive felons?

10:18.980 --> 10:20.612
Yes, George, despite that fact.

10:20.614 --> 10:23.748
Nothing can erase the memory
of the deeds they performed

10:23.750 --> 10:26.517
before they...became unhinged.

10:26.519 --> 10:27.618
'Tell me, commissioner'

10:27.620 --> 10:30.921
'what do you think
brought about this?'

10:30.923 --> 10:34.858
Batman and Robin dead?

10:34.860 --> 10:38.761
What in the world
is going to become of us?

10:38.763 --> 10:43.265
Perhaps that's a better question
than you realize, madam.

10:43.399 --> 10:46.667
How I wish Bruce
and Dick were here.

10:46.669 --> 10:49.469
Maybe they could console me.

10:50.704 --> 10:53.572
I doubt that very much,
Mrs. Cooper.

10:53.574 --> 10:54.773
I doubt it very much.

10:54.775 --> 10:58.309
- Thank you, commissioner.
- Any time, George.

10:58.443 --> 10:59.509
- Hello, chief.
- George.

10:59.511 --> 11:01.477
Uh, for your signature,
commissioner.

11:01.479 --> 11:02.244
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.613
It's a requisition slip
for the ammo we used

11:04.615 --> 11:06.982
getting Batman and Robin
on the big gunfight.

11:06.984 --> 11:08.783
Two hundred
and ninety seven rounds

11:08.785 --> 11:10.651
including
Tommy gun and pistol.

11:10.653 --> 11:12.886
- Strange, isn't it?
- Isn't what strange?

11:12.888 --> 11:16.522
Two hundred and ninety seven
rounds of blank ammunition.

11:16.524 --> 11:20.626
You know them blanks cost
more than the real ones?

11:27.734 --> 11:31.369
Ah! Oh, what a thrill,
Pengy darling.

11:31.371 --> 11:34.705
Driving in your Birdmobile
through Gotham City

11:34.707 --> 11:36.873
on an anti-crime patrol.

11:36.875 --> 11:40.343
Birdmobile? What nerve?

11:40.345 --> 11:41.243
By whatever name

11:41.245 --> 11:44.946
that tiny TV transmitter we
built at back of the fuel gauge

11:44.948 --> 11:45.880
is functioning perfectly.

11:45.882 --> 11:49.950
I just hope some foolish felon
tries to start--

11:49.952 --> 11:52.352
Look! Isn't that a holdup?

11:52.354 --> 11:55.855
Handover that payroll
or get ventilated.

11:55.857 --> 11:57.756
Pengy, it is a holdup.

11:57.758 --> 12:01.192
Was a holdup up you mean.

12:06.130 --> 12:08.563
Oh, Pengy, you routed him.

12:08.565 --> 12:11.299
Oh, what a crime fighter.

12:11.301 --> 12:14.168
What a man of action.

12:16.271 --> 12:17.871
Holy mush!

12:17.873 --> 12:18.838
I bet your milkshake

12:18.840 --> 12:22.541
that so-called holdup
Penguin just foiled

12:22.543 --> 12:23.542
was another charade.

12:23.544 --> 12:27.846
Gosh, Batman, I think it's time
we came back from the grave

12:27.848 --> 12:29.814
and nail that brassy bird!

12:29.816 --> 12:30.381
Patience, Robin.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.217
Our seeming demise
is our trump card.

12:33.219 --> 12:37.321
That and letting him
steal the Batmobile.

12:38.423 --> 12:43.093
I'd sure like to try some of the
special gimmicks we installed.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.196
Don't worry, Robin.
We'll have time.

12:46.198 --> 12:50.567
Just as soon as The Penguin
reveals his plot.

12:50.569 --> 12:54.837
I know it has something
to do with Sophia Starr.

12:54.839 --> 12:57.573
Sweet Sophia.

12:57.575 --> 13:00.842
Darling Pengy birdie.

13:00.844 --> 13:03.845
Holy Romeo and Juliet!

13:14.223 --> 13:18.359
Sophia...look into my eyes.

13:18.927 --> 13:20.861
Will you?

13:20.863 --> 13:23.029
Will you?

13:23.864 --> 13:24.997
Will you?

13:24.999 --> 13:27.499
Oh, yes, Penguin.

13:27.501 --> 13:31.102
Yes, yes.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.236
Oh, yes.

13:33.238 --> 13:34.870
Yeah.

13:40.943 --> 13:44.145
- Solid gold dinner sets.
- Check.

13:44.147 --> 13:48.549
Diamond studded
electric can opener.

13:48.551 --> 13:49.349
Check.

13:49.351 --> 13:52.418
- Oil well.
- Check.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.219
Oil well?

13:54.221 --> 13:56.554
The deeds
in the envelope, stupid.

13:56.556 --> 13:59.456
From the bride's uncle in Texas.

13:59.458 --> 14:00.490
Wow!

14:03.360 --> 14:04.993
The guests have come.

14:04.995 --> 14:06.094
- Everything set?
- Yeah.

14:06.096 --> 14:11.099
The bomb we placed in the water
pipes ought to go off right..

14:26.580 --> 14:27.913
Perfect, eh?

14:28.315 --> 14:29.580
Good gracious!
What happened?

14:29.582 --> 14:31.582
Oh, nothing to bother you,
my little love.

14:31.584 --> 14:33.951
One of those dratted
water pipes seems to have burst.

14:33.953 --> 14:38.055
Luckily, we brought some
water buckets and umbrellas too.

14:38.057 --> 14:40.924
Enough for small list
of distinguished guests.

14:40.926 --> 14:42.825
Oh, you are fantastic, Penguin.

14:42.827 --> 14:44.927
Is there anything
you're not prepared for?

14:44.929 --> 14:48.797
I hope not, my sweet...muah.
I hope not.

14:50.966 --> 14:54.702
What? It seems
to be rainin' in here?

14:56.338 --> 14:58.104
Man the buckets,
my good man.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.605
Sure thing, Mr. Penguin.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.406
...it's raining in here.

15:01.408 --> 15:04.075
It's raining in the house.

15:04.943 --> 15:07.911
I've never seen
anything like this.

15:07.913 --> 15:11.447
Pass out the
emergency umbrellas, Dove.

15:11.449 --> 15:13.849
Right away, Mr. Penguin.

15:13.851 --> 15:15.517
Hi.

15:19.388 --> 15:23.524
Here you are, folks.
Take your umbrellas.

15:23.526 --> 15:26.693
Oh, he's going
to give us umbrellas.

15:26.695 --> 15:29.962
The Penguin and umbrellas?
It spells trouble.

15:29.964 --> 15:33.498
Well, sure then I'm glad
we're on the guest list.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.766
- Oh.
- Yes.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.436
Oh!

15:41.438 --> 15:43.404
How charming and unusual!

15:43.406 --> 15:45.539
An indoor wedding in the rain.

15:45.541 --> 15:48.975
All the gifts are on display
and we have a charming buffet.

15:48.977 --> 15:52.678
Open your umbrellas.
It's raining heavily in here.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.814
- Yes.
- Watch the bucket.

15:59.118 --> 16:02.720
How do you do?
How do you do?

16:05.790 --> 16:08.792
Thank you. Thank you.

16:39.888 --> 16:43.190
Great Scot!
The wedding presents.

16:43.192 --> 16:46.526
One of your criminals
has done that.

16:46.528 --> 16:50.663
He's taken advantage
of this bizarre confusion

16:50.665 --> 16:51.697
to steal my dowry.

16:51.699 --> 16:54.766
If you want to see the crook
who's behind this

16:54.768 --> 16:56.033
look in the mirror.

16:56.035 --> 16:58.201
Mirror, mirror.

16:58.203 --> 17:04.906
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest fink of all?

17:14.817 --> 17:17.417
Oh!

17:18.453 --> 17:19.553
Pengy, they fainted!

17:19.555 --> 17:23.022
Well, don't get upset.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

17:23.025 --> 17:25.724
- Eagle-Eye, Dove, come here.
- Yes.

17:25.727 --> 17:27.460
- Let's go.
- Where to, boss?

17:27.462 --> 17:31.630
Well, the criminals must be
below. Quick, to the elevator.

17:31.632 --> 17:35.967
We'll apprehend them.
Or we'll die in the attempt.

17:35.969 --> 17:39.370
Yes, yes. Oh.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.042
Behold!
What a criminal cornucopia!

17:45.044 --> 17:48.779
- Penguin, you're a genius.
- Of course, I'm a genius.

17:48.781 --> 17:51.782
It's too bad that
our two costume clowns

17:51.784 --> 17:53.984
aren't here to see my triumph.

17:53.986 --> 17:55.652
Into our Birdmobile.

17:55.654 --> 17:58.921

18:30.351 --> 18:31.983

18:31.985 --> 18:34.285
Not only robbing
his own wedding, but leaving

18:34.287 --> 18:35.753
that trusting girl at the altar.

Bat-scanner.

Lucky for us he doesn't know
how to actuate

19:25.031 --> 19:27.698
the super speed afterburner.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.701
Time to jolt him
with our gimmicks, huh?

19:30.703 --> 19:31.334
Roger.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.436
We'll start by giving

hit some dratted button.

Come here, you black raven..

20:19.644 --> 20:21.110
Look. Look at him, Robin.

20:21.112 --> 20:23.779
That crooked bird
is going crazy.

20:23.781 --> 20:24.646
Be careful, Batman.

20:24.648 --> 20:27.715
We don't want him
to smash up the Batmobile.

20:27.717 --> 20:28.549
Good point, Robin.

20:28.551 --> 20:32.185

by remote control.

21:11.789 --> 21:16.958
Hold tight, Penguin.
Emergency turn coming up.

21:23.631 --> 21:26.466
Forget the scenic route,
you black vulture.

21:26.468 --> 21:29.602
Just get me back
on the main road.

21:33.907 --> 21:36.909
Look, Batman,
Penguin's ugly guts.

21:36.911 --> 21:39.711
Let's rack 'em up, huh?

21:41.013 --> 21:44.181
You see what I see, Dove.

21:44.183 --> 21:45.715
What is it, Eagle-Eye?

21:45.717 --> 21:48.918
I see ghosts on a Bat-cycle!

21:52.088 --> 21:56.124
Ghosts, huh? I don't think you
crooks have the right spirit!

22:07.202 --> 22:10.704
The Batmobile.
Let's get the controls.

22:18.577 --> 22:20.878
Back from the grave,
you tricksters, eh?

22:20.880 --> 22:23.947
Back to send you on
a honeymoon cruise, Penguin.

22:23.949 --> 22:24.814
Up the river to the pen!

22:24.816 --> 22:28.884
- Gone straight, huh?
- We'll straighten you out!

22:45.065 --> 22:49.601
- Case closed, Batman?
- Yes, except for one detail.

22:49.603 --> 22:52.604
- What's that?
- The Batmobile.

22:52.606 --> 22:56.107
We'll have to have it fumigated.

23:04.884 --> 23:10.188
Here you are, Miss Starr.
All the stolen gifts recovered.

23:10.190 --> 23:11.989
I wonder.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.190
What Miss Starr?

23:13.192 --> 23:14.991
The love and affection
I'd provide.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.793
It might be just the thing
that would turn him

23:17.795 --> 23:20.095
into an honest,
law-abiding citizen.

23:20.097 --> 23:21.029
Great scot, Miss Starr!

23:21.031 --> 23:25.433
You'd still consider becoming
that crooked bird's wife?

23:25.435 --> 23:26.700
Why not?

23:26.702 --> 23:27.834
I'd make him a nest

23:27.836 --> 23:30.736
where he'd feel warm
and protected and loved.

23:30.738 --> 23:34.306
It's a challenge to quicken
any woman's heart.

23:36.075 --> 23:39.043
Officer, bring in Penguin.

23:43.314 --> 23:45.682
Oh, my dear, Pengy.

23:45.684 --> 23:47.717
- My poor little sick bird.
- It was mine.

23:47.719 --> 23:52.021
I tell you it was all in my
grip. This was my oil well.

23:52.023 --> 23:55.257
And this is my solid gold
dinner silver.

23:55.259 --> 23:58.393
And this was my diamond-studded
can opener.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.728
You greedy bird!
Have you no conscience?

24:00.730 --> 24:04.098
This woman loves you. She's
still willing to marry you.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.200
Who, me? The Penguin?

24:06.202 --> 24:08.402
Married
and kept in a bathtub?

24:08.404 --> 24:12.739
I love you, Pengy.
I'd try very hard to reform you.

24:12.741 --> 24:15.174
