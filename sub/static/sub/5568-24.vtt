¶ "Square One" ¶

00:05.106 --> 00:06.505
(upbeat music plays)

00:06.507 --> 00:08.874
Hey, guys,
you know how summer break

00:08.876 --> 00:10.709
has totally sucked so far?

00:10.711 --> 00:12.678
It's been one day, Eddie.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.713
Well,
things are about to change.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.949
Chris Rock has a new
stand-up special on HBO

00:16.951 --> 00:18.717
called "Bring the Pain."

00:18.719 --> 00:23.989
I hear it's even more amazing
than "CB4," which is impossible!

00:23.991 --> 00:25.691
But our cable got canceled

00:25.693 --> 00:28.293
when they found out Mom
subscribed under a fake name.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.029
Oh, no! They found out about
Sydney Jones?

00:30.031 --> 00:31.697
I guess we can't watch
the special, then.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.698
Bam!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.967
Or can we?

00:34.969 --> 00:37.469
HBO's doing a free preview
all weekend?

00:37.471 --> 00:39.138
My girl Alison told me about it.

00:39.140 --> 00:42.007
Evan, toss me that remote.
Let's get our minds blown.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.476
We're watching "Square One."
It's educational.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.811
But that's just regular TV!

00:45.813 --> 00:47.479
You can watch that anytime!

00:47.481 --> 00:49.648
I have my routine.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.150
Emery: You might like
this show, Eddie.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.485
It has detectives
who use math to solve crimes.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.221
Do they solve the crime
of being a super boring show?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.890
Just give me the damn remote!

00:57.892 --> 00:59.725
No! It's my time! Stop it!

00:59.727 --> 01:01.226
Use your words!

01:01.228 --> 01:02.494
(indistinct shouting)

01:02.496 --> 01:04.329
Hey, hey, hey! Break it up!

01:04.331 --> 01:06.098
What's going on? Nothing.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.534
We're just talking. (Sighs)

01:08.536 --> 01:10.869
Eddie, you shouldn't be fighting
with your brothers.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.371
It's you guys against the world.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.672
You're all each other has.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.274
Louis, your brother's
on the phone.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.843
Tell that bastard to go to hell!

01:20.681 --> 01:22.114
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:22.116 --> 01:23.849
¶ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ¶

01:23.851 --> 01:25.951
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

01:25.953 --> 01:27.553
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:27.555 --> 01:29.588
¶ Homey, you don't know
where I come from ¶

01:29.590 --> 01:31.123
¶ But I know where I'm goin' ¶

01:31.125 --> 01:33.792
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

01:35.029 --> 01:36.962
Sorry, Gene, Louis is busy...

01:38.532 --> 01:40.632
doing pottery.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.701
(sighs) I'm obviously fishing.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.303
Maybe<i> I'm</i> not bad at charades.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.971
Maybe<i> you're</i> bad at charades.

01:45.973 --> 01:49.374
Louis Huang, you just said
brothers shouldn't fight.

01:49.376 --> 01:53.212
I thought we lived in Orlando,
not a make-believe lie town.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.313
Bye, Gene.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.849
Gene is coming to visit.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.785
He says he has some big news

01:59.787 --> 02:01.420
that he wants to share
in person.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.388
Is he starting another band?

02:03.390 --> 02:06.391
The Gene Huang Ragtime Explosion
didn't work out?

02:06.393 --> 02:08.393
Wasn't that also the name
of his vacuum-cleaner company?

02:08.395 --> 02:10.729
No. That was
Gene Huang Suck City.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.797
(sighs)

02:14.568 --> 02:15.667
That's not my fault.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.407
I came to terms with that.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.909
Gene's the one
who's still holding on.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.310
He's such a little baby.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.846
I feel you, Pops.
Brothers are so annoying.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.649
Be respectful.
That's your uncle.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.752
But yes, he is super annoying.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.493
Why, because he held a job
for more than six months?

02:48.969 --> 02:51.470
Give it to me! I don't care
about your stupid show!

02:51.472 --> 02:53.772
If one of you rips my shirt,
I'll destroy you!

02:53.774 --> 02:55.541
Jessica: Hey, come on!
It's mine!

02:55.543 --> 02:57.042
Stop fighting now!

02:57.044 --> 02:58.277
Hey!

02:58.279 --> 03:00.179
But I need to watch
"Bring the Pain."

03:00.181 --> 03:02.014
It's an urban
stand-up show, Mommy,

03:02.016 --> 03:03.949
rated "R"
for inappropriate content.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.552
Alison's leaving for band camp
in two weeks.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.787
We need to cram
the entire summer into 14 days,

03:08.789 --> 03:11.123
and we want to spend them
talking about this show!

03:11.125 --> 03:13.725
Forget it. I heard about
that show on "Nightly News."

03:13.727 --> 03:15.360
It's causing race riots.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.730
I am not waking up
to a race riot in my own house.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.567
Announcer:
The story you are about to see

03:21.569 --> 03:23.535
is a fib, but it's short.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.405
The names have been made up, and
the problems are real. (Sighs)

03:26.407 --> 03:30.075
¶¶

03:30.077 --> 03:31.910
I can't believe
Gene is coming to visit.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.213
We haven't seen him
since we went back to Taiwan

03:34.215 --> 03:35.881
right after we got engaged.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.217
He did something
that made me very uncomfortable.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.885
Did he make a pass at you?

03:39.887 --> 03:43.021
Marvin's brother Marlon
is always knocking at that door,

03:43.023 --> 03:44.823
trying to get some vitamin H.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.158
No. This is worse.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.660
He loaned me $200.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.162
(mug clanks)

03:50.164 --> 03:52.531
I couldn't afford
to buy Louis' wedding ring

03:52.533 --> 03:55.334
because I spent too much money
at the night market

03:55.336 --> 03:56.535
on some fake Jordache.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.869
Gene helped me out,

03:57.871 --> 04:00.205
and he's never let me
pay him back.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.707
And that's bad because...?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.242
In Chinese families,

04:03.244 --> 04:06.044
no one likes
to owe anyone anything.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.412
It's like how you must've felt

04:07.414 --> 04:09.181
when you kept my Tupperware
for too long.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.515
That's are actually
<i>my</i> Tupperware,

04:10.517 --> 04:12.017
and you still have it.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.519
And if you were Chinese,
I would feel bad about that.

04:15.522 --> 04:19.758
I've sent him checks for years,
but he never cashes them.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.593
If Gene
won't take your money directly,

04:21.595 --> 04:23.829
then just give him something
that's worth $200.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.633
Yeah. That's a good idea.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.201
Good news.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.270
Marlon booked a cruise,
just the three of us.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.738
He said bring your bikini!

04:32.740 --> 04:34.006
(chuckles)

04:35.542 --> 04:37.909
I mean...

04:37.911 --> 04:40.746
¶¶

04:40.748 --> 04:43.081
Hey, guys. What's wrong?

04:43.083 --> 04:44.716
We just saw "Bring the Pain,"

04:44.718 --> 04:47.085
and it's like a truth bomb
blew up in our faces.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.721
Chris Rock is right.
The war on drugs is a lie.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.089
Told you.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.258
"You know what
the good side of crack is?"

04:53.260 --> 04:55.594
No! I haven't seen it yet!
Let Chris tell me!

04:55.596 --> 04:57.329
Eddie, I thought you said
you'd watch it.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.630
I'm leaving for band camp soon.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.399
We only have
13 days of summer together!

05:00.401 --> 05:01.967
I will. I promise.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.336
Until then, let's just
talk about something else.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.309
Eddie... here's the thing.

05:10.311 --> 05:13.812
We all want Alison to say the
punch line to the crack joke.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.982
Alison wants to say the punch
line to the crack joke.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.452
So you can either stay or scoot.

05:20.454 --> 05:26.258
In five, four, three, two, one.

05:26.260 --> 05:31.029
(hip-hop music plays)

05:33.200 --> 05:35.233
(cheers and applause)

05:36.437 --> 05:38.637
(blows) Can't let you do that.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.872
Why?
You're not even watching TV!

05:40.874 --> 05:43.041
Mom told us to make sure
you stay honest.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.943
She made us deputy moms!

05:44.945 --> 05:46.378
Louis: Everyone get in the van.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.947
We have to go pick up
your Uncle Gene.

05:48.949 --> 05:53.852
¶¶

05:53.854 --> 05:56.388
Dad, I thought you didn't want
Uncle Gene to come visit.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.391
I don't, son, but I'm setting
an example for you boys.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.159
It's called being an adult.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.196
You have to do stuff you
don't want to do all the time.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.530
I'm glad Gene's coming.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.469
Gonna make him feel comfortable,

06:10.471 --> 06:14.206
treat him like a king...
for under $200.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.340
Gene: Hi, Louis.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.309
Gene!

06:17.311 --> 06:19.044
How did you... I came
from another gate.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.479
Ma!

06:20.481 --> 06:21.847
(both laugh)

06:21.849 --> 06:24.249
Mom, you look so small!

06:25.519 --> 06:27.419
(laughs) You look good, Gene.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.755
Nice to see you again.
Welcome to Orlando.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.190
"Welcome to Orlando."
Who are you, my parole officer?

06:32.192 --> 06:34.092
Come on. Bring it in!
(inhales deeply)

06:34.094 --> 06:36.695
Aww. (Chuckles)

06:36.697 --> 06:38.697
Oh, look at the three of you.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.265
Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.100
Is that a joke
from 'Bring the Pain"?

06:42.102 --> 06:43.168
Let Chris tell me!

06:44.171 --> 06:45.337
You live in Taiwan.

06:45.339 --> 06:46.705
Why don't you have an accent?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.340
Well,
I work for Delta Airlines now,

06:48.342 --> 06:50.242
which is how I got
those last-minute tickets

06:50.244 --> 06:51.510
for nothing... (chuckles)

06:51.512 --> 06:52.611
Mm.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.212
And during pilot training,

06:54.214 --> 06:56.047
I had to learn
"Airline English".

06:56.049 --> 06:57.682
Prepare for an ocean landing.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.950
So cool!

06:58.952 --> 07:01.720
I want to be a flight attendant!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.355
Do you get to marry people
like ship captains?

07:03.357 --> 07:04.856
Nope, but I do it anyway.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.092
Well, I hope this pilot thing
works out for you.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.594
Unlike that lychee-nut
face cream you were developing.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.897
Wow. If I knew you were
having so much trouble,

07:11.899 --> 07:14.199
I would have brought some with me.
Trouble?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.368
Listen, Louis, I didn't
come here just to visit.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.503
I have some big news.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.472
I'm getting married.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.307
(gasps) Awesome!

07:22.309 --> 07:24.242
What better way to celebrate

07:24.244 --> 07:26.311
than by renting a Chevy Lumina
for two days?

07:26.313 --> 07:27.979
I'll pay for it.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.915
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please, don't waste your money.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.917
Oh, you want
to play it that way?

07:31.919 --> 07:34.653
Okay. I can play it that way.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.887
I'm sorry. What?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.823
Congrats, Gene.
Who's the lucky lady?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.591
That masseuse you met in Phuket?

07:39.593 --> 07:40.659
(chuckles) No.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.427
Come on. It's her sister.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.829
Ah, I'm kidding!

07:43.831 --> 07:46.064
My fiancée's name is Margaret.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.399
She's a consultant.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.568
Very prominent family.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.470
Things are finally
coming together for me.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.572
(chuckles)
Oh, good for you, Gene.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.807
Uh, here, let me carry your bag.
No.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.075
I've got it.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.410
No, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:58.412 --> 07:59.711
No, no. No, no.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.950
They're being nice
to each other.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.351
It's a Chinese polite-fight.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.953
You're never
supposed to give in.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.621
These things can get
hella intense.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.089
No, no, no, no. At least
let me carry the wheel.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.290
Oh, no.
Let me carry your jacket.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.792
Well, I'm wearing my jacket.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.460
Well, I'll wear it out.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.695
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.196
No, no, no, no. Okay.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.431
No, no, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.665
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.933
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.301
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.703
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.837
No, no, no, no.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.111
"Now, remain calm

08:33.113 --> 08:36.348
and hold on to your seat
cushions until I say 'brace.'"

08:36.350 --> 08:37.349
Awesome! Cool!

08:37.351 --> 08:38.717
You were warning them

08:38.719 --> 08:40.352
'cause you're the president
of the plane!

08:40.354 --> 08:41.653
That's right, baby.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.722
So, uh, Gene,
I hope you're hungry,

08:43.724 --> 08:46.491
because we're treating you to a
nice meal at Cattleman's Ranch.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.060
Isn't your family bored
of eating at your restaurant?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.562
Yes, we are! I'm so
tired of the menu.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.397
The portion size is so small.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.967
We got to celebrate, baby!
I've overcome so much.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.471
Took me a while, but my life
is finally on the right track,

08:59.473 --> 09:01.740
which is why
I made us a reservation

09:01.742 --> 09:04.576
at the best restaurant
in Orlando.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.011
(Backstreet Boys'
"We've Got It Goin' On" plays)

09:06.013 --> 09:07.712
¶ Jam on,
'cause Backstreet's got it ¶

09:07.714 --> 09:09.881
¶ Come on, now, everybody ¶

09:09.883 --> 09:14.085
¶ We've got it goin' on
for years ¶

09:14.087 --> 09:16.054
¶ Jam on,
'cause Backstreet's got it ¶

09:16.056 --> 09:19.157
Why do we need to go
to an Orlando-themed restaurant

09:19.159 --> 09:21.526
when we live in Orlando?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.461
What is that?

09:25.599 --> 09:26.932
Mel Gibson's mullet.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.267
They shot "Lethal Weapon 3"
here.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.236
We'll take a table
by the mullet.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.671
Very good, sir.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.507
(As Louis)
Uh, hello, I'm Louis Huang.

09:35.509 --> 09:38.009
Welcome to Cattleman's Ranch!

09:38.011 --> 09:41.112
You know, I have
a very positive outlook on life.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.547
(Both laugh)

09:42.549 --> 09:45.116
I see that acting class
in Saipan paid off.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.618
(Normal voice) It did.
I'm still getting residuals

09:46.620 --> 09:48.386
from that
fabric-softener commercial.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.922
In fact, that's where I first
met my fiancée, Margaret.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.958
Man, I can't wait
for you all to meet her.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.292
You should see her ring.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.961
Oh, should we?
Should we see her ring?

09:55.963 --> 09:58.463
Well-done, Gene.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.965
Well-done.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.967
Is Jessica okay? I never know.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.802
All right.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.704
Anyway, Louis,
I didn't come all the way here

10:05.706 --> 10:06.972
just to announce my wedding.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.607
I know
we haven't seen each other

10:08.609 --> 10:12.310
since what happened at
the, you know, hot springs,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.946
but let's put the past behind us
and move forward.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.449
Look (sighs)
I want my future children

10:17.451 --> 10:19.084
to know their cousins.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.721
That's why I wanted to ask you,
in person...

10:22.723 --> 10:24.656
if you'd be my best man.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.725
¶¶

10:26.727 --> 10:28.627
(chuckles)

10:28.629 --> 10:30.829
I'd be honored.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.164
(chuckles) That's great!

10:33.166 --> 10:34.299
(chuckles)

10:34.301 --> 10:36.167
Come here, brother.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.268
Oh.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.337
Oh, sorry.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.439
(laughs)

10:41.441 --> 10:43.008
To celebrate,
you should order more food.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.176
What do you have that is $200?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.177
Nothing.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.113
Well, think.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.015
Excuse me.
Where is the bathroom?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.216
Yeah. Right here.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.087
I'll pay the bill.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.156
(indistinct conversations)

10:58.158 --> 10:59.157
(cash register dinging)

10:59.159 --> 11:00.425
What are you doing?

11:00.427 --> 11:01.793
(scoffs) You didn't really think

11:01.795 --> 11:02.861
I had to go
to the bathroom, did you?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.162
Give me the bill.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.764
(chuckles) No, no, I got it.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.032
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.801
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.269
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.971
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.439
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.874
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.042
No, no, no. No. No. No.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.043
No. No.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.044
No. No.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.045
No. No.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.212
(chuckling) No. No.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.381
No. No!

11:23.383 --> 11:25.216
No! No!!

11:25.218 --> 11:26.851
¶¶

11:26.853 --> 11:28.186
You still haven't seen it?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.388
But you and Alison
are running out of summer.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.358
My brothers will narc on me if I watch
it, and they're around all the time.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.828
Just do what I do when I want to
watch something R-rated or above.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.464
Videotape it late at night,
when everyone's asleep.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.801
Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.969
That's how I saw
"Emmanuelle in Space."

11:44.971 --> 11:47.972
I wasn't ready for it.

11:47.974 --> 11:52.911
¶¶

11:53.980 --> 11:56.715
I'm sorry it's come to this.

11:56.717 --> 11:57.916
Keep the bag.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.684
What? No!

11:59.686 --> 12:01.686
I was gonna cut a hole
in your luggage

12:01.688 --> 12:05.056
where I could hide the $200 I
owe you for Louis' wedding ring

12:05.058 --> 12:07.358
so you wouldn't find it
till you got back to Taiwan.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.493
Oh, yeah. (Chuckles)

12:08.495 --> 12:10.095
I forgot about that.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.263
Look, I don't like to take money
from my sister-in-law,

12:12.265 --> 12:14.699
but if it means
that much to you, fine.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.000
You can pay me back.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.236
Really? Mm-hmm.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.004
(chuckles)

12:20.006 --> 12:21.573
Thank you.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.007
(chuckles) I can't believe

12:23.009 --> 12:24.943
you were gonna cut a hole
in my luggage.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.111
I mean, it's a Tumi.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.178
It says "Tami."

12:28.348 --> 12:30.014
Yeah, you got me. (Chuckles)

12:30.016 --> 12:32.417
(As Arnold Schwarzenegger)
No, it's not a Tumi.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.585
(laughs)

12:33.587 --> 12:35.186
It says "Tami."

12:36.256 --> 12:40.291
¶¶

12:41.561 --> 12:42.961
It worked!

12:42.963 --> 12:44.596
¶¶

12:44.598 --> 12:46.064
(sighs)

12:46.066 --> 12:48.266
Sorry I had to tape over you,
Bruce Leroy.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.201
¶¶

12:53.907 --> 12:55.306
What's up?!

12:55.308 --> 12:56.775
What's up, Chris Rock?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.277
Unh, unh, unh.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.646
What the hell?! Eddie,
don't say "hell."

13:01.648 --> 13:03.281
We knew
you'd try something like this,

13:03.283 --> 13:04.983
so we used Dad's camcorder

13:04.985 --> 13:06.684
to record over
your Chris Rock tape.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.821
Thank you, Eddie. We take
that word as a compliment.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.556
I didn't say anything.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.424
I thought you'd call us nerds.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.960
We recorded
a more age-appropriate program

13:15.962 --> 13:17.228
for you to watch.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.730
("Bless My Happy Home" plays)

13:20.934 --> 13:23.668
(laughs) Those hayseeds!

13:23.670 --> 13:25.003
(chuckles)

13:27.507 --> 13:29.340
What is that on your face?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.810
Just, uh, shining up the lobby.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.311
(chuckles)

13:37.017 --> 13:39.083
What's that on<i> your</i> face?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.252
What? You're smiling.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.888
I am. I am happy.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.158
I can't just be happy
for no reason?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.594
We both know you can't.
What's going on?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.863
(sighs) Okay. Fine.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.031
I never told you this.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.766
A long time ago,

13:54.768 --> 13:57.302
I borrowed money from Gene
to buy your wedding ring...

13:57.304 --> 13:59.037
What?! ...and I've been trying

13:59.039 --> 14:01.539
for all these years to pay him
back, and he never let me.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.542
And today, I finally succeeded.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.010
You shouldn't have done that.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.712
I know, but we were in Taiwan,

14:07.714 --> 14:09.848
and Jordache had just come out
with their Basics line.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.683
They had horse-face rivets
down the leg.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.718
No, you shouldn't have
paid him back.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.853
He owes us thousands.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.020
Wait.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.723
<i>He</i> owes<i> us</i> money?

14:18.725 --> 14:21.125
I've been sending him money
for years.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.493
Why? He's my brother.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.796
It's my responsibility
to help him.

14:24.798 --> 14:31.302
So, he owes us thousands
and he let me give him $200?!

14:31.304 --> 14:34.072
(ragtime music playing on piano)

14:34.074 --> 14:36.140
(crash, sour notes play)

14:37.878 --> 14:40.044
You broke the piano?!

14:40.046 --> 14:41.880
I wanted to play some ragtime
before bed.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.648
You know how
I like to pound the keys.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.890
At least you're doing well now,
so you can pay for this.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.091
(inhales sharply)

14:53.093 --> 14:54.726
Yeah, I got a wedding coming up,

14:54.728 --> 14:56.928
and, like, Margaret wants
to release doves, so...

14:56.930 --> 14:59.364
Well, you can use the $200
I just gave you.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.532
Or maybe
you have something left over

15:01.534 --> 15:04.035
from the money I sent you
for piano lessons,

15:04.037 --> 15:06.504
acting classes, flight school,

15:06.506 --> 15:09.340
lychee-nut farming,
vacuum-repair workshop...

15:09.342 --> 15:11.776
Don't pretend to be
this generous guy.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.679
You sent me that money
because you felt guilty

15:14.681 --> 15:17.181
about what happened
at the hot springs.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.685
You haven't changed. You're still not
over what happened at the hot springs.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.687
Damn right I'm not!
I'll<i> never</i> be over it!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.923
You stole America from me!

15:24.925 --> 15:28.159
(whirring)

15:29.896 --> 15:32.630
Is the VCR recording something?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.699
It's a head cleaner.
I'm cleaning the heads.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.935
I care about our things.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.269
¶¶

15:43.109 --> 15:44.742
What are you talking about?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.211
What do you mean,
Louis stole America from you?

15:47.213 --> 15:50.148
Get over it, Gene.
It was a long time ago.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.716
Oh, Louis never told you about

15:51.718 --> 15:53.318
what happened
at the hot springs?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.253
You mean the time
he wore a bathing suit

15:55.255 --> 15:57.555
and everyone made fun of him
for not being naked?

15:57.557 --> 15:58.923
(scoffs) Please.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.092
Louis was the first one
to strip nude.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.160
He<i> arrived</i> nude.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.495
I'm proud of my body.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.497
So, what<i> really</i> happened?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.081
(chuckles)

16:40.600 --> 16:42.500
Okay. Yes. I'll go.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.169
Louis: Say bye to Mom for me!

16:49.876 --> 16:51.342
You said yes?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.544
In the middle
of a Chinese polite fight?!

16:53.546 --> 16:55.680
Gene: That was
so selfish of you.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.048
You should have sacrificed.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.216
I<i> did</i> sacrifice!

16:58.218 --> 16:59.884
I took on the responsibility

16:59.886 --> 17:02.020
of being the one
who got to come here.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.288
I worked hard, got a job,
sent money back,

17:04.290 --> 17:06.557
not just to you,
but to the whole family.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.127
Would you have done that?
I don't know.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.962
I never got the opportunity.
<i>You</i> did.

17:10.964 --> 17:14.132
You took my coming to America
as an excuse to not succeed.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.968
That's why it took you so long
to get it together.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.636
But you have a great job now!

17:18.638 --> 17:20.171
You're about to get married.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.506
Your life turned out fine.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.874
Eventually, it did!

17:22.876 --> 17:25.943
But who knows
what my life could have become?!

17:28.181 --> 17:32.250
Maybe we would have sat next to
<i>my</i> mullet at the restaurant.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.585
¶¶

17:34.587 --> 17:36.054
(door closes)

17:36.056 --> 17:37.422
¶¶

17:38.892 --> 17:39.891
(door closes)

17:39.893 --> 17:41.492
Eddie: We need to talk.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.995
Free HBO is almost over,
and Alison's leaving in 11 days.

17:43.997 --> 17:47.031
So I came in to tell you
that I give up.

17:47.033 --> 17:50.835
But also to ask you...
to join me.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.937
You're just saying that 'cause
you want to watch your show.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.672
True, true.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.008
But... I also don't want
to be like Dad and Uncle Gene.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.510
I don't want this
to be our hot springs.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.345
I have no idea what that means.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.915
We're brothers.
We're all each other has.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.250
Mom divided us,
but let's come together...

18:06.252 --> 18:08.352
like Voltron.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.388
I'm the leg!

18:10.390 --> 18:13.291
¶¶

18:13.293 --> 18:15.093
Do you want to talk about it?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.128
No. I've done
enough talking today.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.764
Okay. Good night.

18:21.267 --> 18:25.837
(mumbling)

18:27.574 --> 18:29.307
Louis, stop mumbling.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.808
Say words or don't say words.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.876
I feel bad.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.045
And what if Gene's right?

18:34.047 --> 18:35.379
(sighs)

18:35.381 --> 18:38.950
You have nothing
to feel bad about.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.419
But his life would probably
be better if he came here.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.054
You don't know that!

18:43.056 --> 18:45.389
Besides, only one of you
was gonna get the opportunity.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.291
Why shouldn't it be you?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.726
I guess...

18:48.728 --> 18:50.828
If you hadn't come here,
we never would have met.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.832
I don't regret
the decision you made.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.668
You have nothing
to apologize for.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.937
Thank you.

18:59.939 --> 19:03.674
Unless you want to set
a good example for the boys.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.310
(groans) I hate being an adult.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.679
Me, too.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.315
I'm lying. I love it.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.418
I love every aspect of it.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.586
(sighs)

19:15.588 --> 19:17.021
Ma, have you seen Gene?

19:17.023 --> 19:19.190
I can't find him.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.193
¶¶

19:25.031 --> 19:27.098
You better recognize!

19:27.100 --> 19:28.366
(laughter)

19:28.368 --> 19:29.700
Shh!

19:29.702 --> 19:32.103
Don't laugh so loud.
You'll wake Mom and Dad.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.738
Just snap instead of laugh.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.209
I don't care for
all the bad language,

19:38.211 --> 19:40.811
but this is just as educational
as "Square One."

19:40.813 --> 19:43.514
I'm just glad
he doesn't do lame Asian jokes.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.283
I don't care what time it is.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.617
I'm calling Alison now.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.621
We still h...

19:52.725 --> 19:54.792
I need to call the airline.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.127
What's going on?

19:56.129 --> 19:57.662
Gene went back to Taiwan.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.231
He left this note
uninviting us to the wedding.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.133
(gasps) And he took Grandma.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.535
(gasps) Forever?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.870
No! Just for the wedding.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.806
So, why do you need
to call the airline?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.409
Because I need to make
things right with my brother.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.543
(sighs)

20:12.545 --> 20:13.878
We're all going to Taiwan.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.046
(chuckles)

20:15.048 --> 20:16.047
Good.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.516
I'm gonna get my $200 back.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.318
Turn off the race riot
and start packing.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.324
You're going to Taiwan?!

20:26.326 --> 20:27.692
But I leave for band camp in 10 days!
It's okay.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.859
I'm gonna get myself
a phone card,

20:28.861 --> 20:31.095
and I'll call you every day.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.730
I'll even try to fax you
when possible.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.865
But you're gonna need
to set up an account at Kinko's.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.867
There's one
right by my dad's work.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.336
And when I get back,

20:38.338 --> 20:40.071
you and I will still have
half a day together,

20:40.073 --> 20:41.939
and we'll spend our summer
talking about Chris Rock then.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.442
(scraping)

20:52.452 --> 20:53.951
(Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's

20:53.953 --> 20:55.786
¶ Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone ¶

20:55.788 --> 20:58.756
¶ Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone ¶

20:58.758 --> 21:00.224
¶ Tell me what ya gonna do ¶

21:00.226 --> 21:02.293
¶ When it ain't nowhere to run ¶

21:02.295 --> 21:03.928
¶ When judgment comes for you ¶

21:03.930 --> 21:05.096
¶ When judgment comes for you ¶

21:05.098 --> 21:07.131
¶ Now tell me what ya gonna do ¶

21:07.133 --> 21:08.566
¶ When it ain't nowhere
to hide ¶

21:08.568 --> 21:10.534
¶ When judgment comes for you ¶

21:10.536 --> 21:12.036
¶ Cause it's gonna come
for you ¶

21:12.038 --> 21:13.871
¶ Let's all bring it in
for Wally ¶

21:13.873 --> 21:14.872
¶ Eazy-E, Uncle Charlie ¶

21:14.874 --> 21:18.809
So... what's up, Trent?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.911
I just got a call
from my cousin.

21:20.913 --> 21:24.482
The Browns
are leaving Cleveland.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.716
(sighs)

21:25.718 --> 21:28.486
(as The Mask) Smokin'.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.955
¶ See you at the crossroads ¶
¶ So you won't be lonely ¶

21:30.957 --> 21:33.858
¶ See you at the crossroads ¶
¶ So you won't be...¶
