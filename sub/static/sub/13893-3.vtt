00:11.520 --> 00:14.790
The next person receiving an appreciation plaque is...

00:14.890 --> 00:15.910
Skips!

00:18.370 --> 00:20.260
It says here in the Book of Park Records

00:20.260 --> 00:23.060
that you went the whole year without taking a day off.

00:23.230 --> 00:26.840
Oh man, that's like, 400 days!

00:27.970 --> 00:30.310
Thanks Skips, we appreciate it!

00:30.330 --> 00:32.500
The next is... Pops!

00:32.560 --> 00:33.950
Hooray!

00:34.030 --> 00:37.340
For helping a baby bird back into its nest.

00:37.340 --> 00:38.540
Oh dude, we're next!

00:38.540 --> 00:41.080
That plaque is gonna look sweet hanging on over my bed!

00:41.080 --> 00:44.010
Yeah! Finally some recognition!

00:44.010 --> 00:45.560
And last, but not least,

00:45.600 --> 00:48.180
two guys who really pulled it together this year.

00:48.190 --> 00:51.550
Two guys that remind us to not just work hard,

00:51.780 --> 00:54.300
but to work hard at having a good time.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.460
Two guys that we couldn't do without.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.980
And these two guys are...

01:00.520 --> 01:02.740
Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost.

01:05.910 --> 01:08.380
Eat on that, Mordecai and Rigby!

01:13.350 --> 01:15.240
C'mon Benson, what about us?

01:15.290 --> 01:17.200
Oh yeah. Mordecai and Rigby.

01:17.390 --> 01:19.300
Let's see, let's see.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.500
Clean up this mess.

01:22.090 --> 01:25.100
Wait Benson! What about our appreciation plaques?

01:25.100 --> 01:26.510
In order to get a plaque,

01:26.510 --> 01:28.860
you have to do something that's appreciated.

01:28.860 --> 01:30.860
And according to The Book of Park Records,

01:30.860 --> 01:33.580
all you guys do is mess up and slack off.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.380
We do stuff for The Park all the time.

01:35.380 --> 01:37.630
Yeah, there has got to be something good about us in that book!

01:37.630 --> 01:40.710
This book is a record of everything that has ever happened in The Park.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.080
It's been handed down from manager to manager

01:43.080 --> 01:44.560
since The Park's founding.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.990
It's a sacred document, so keep your dirty hands off!

01:48.330 --> 01:50.320
Can't you fund in a bit to make us look better?

01:50.320 --> 01:52.020
No, I can only write the truth,

01:52.020 --> 01:54.500
and the truth is I don't appreciate you.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.380
Aw, I can't believe this!

01:59.420 --> 02:00.340
Relax dude.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.020
We just need to do some work so he'll see what awesome employees we are.

02:03.070 --> 02:05.020
I bet if he sees us doing one job,

02:05.070 --> 02:06.700
he'll totally appreciate us.

02:06.810 --> 02:08.610
Yeah! We'll make him appreciate us so hard,

02:08.610 --> 02:10.570
we'll be the ones handing out the plaques!

02:10.990 --> 02:12.570
To.....ourselves.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.780
Aww, this is hopeless!

02:48.780 --> 02:50.830
Benson is never gonna appreciate us!

02:50.870 --> 02:53.670
Anyone who reads that book will think we're complete slackers.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.350
What if we change it?

02:55.400 --> 02:58.460
We can re-write it so we look like the employees of the century!

02:58.510 --> 03:01.470
Dude! Let's go change that book!

03:06.070 --> 03:07.220
The coast is clear!

03:08.350 --> 03:10.490
The Book of Park Records.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.370
Dude, open it up!

03:14.510 --> 03:17.060
I don't know man. Maybe we shouldn't do this.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.030
What if we aren't meant to see what's inside?

03:19.540 --> 03:21.470
If we were not supposed to see what's inside,

03:21.470 --> 03:23.160
they shouldn't have taught us how to read!

03:24.070 --> 03:25.880
- I found our names! - Gimme that!

03:26.320 --> 03:29.920
Mordecai and Rigby are lazy, good-for-nothing slackers?!

03:30.870 --> 03:31.920
It's kind of true.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.050
Their continued employment is one of life's greatest mysteries!

03:36.250 --> 03:38.910
Can't be taught, untrustworthy, useless,

03:39.000 --> 03:40.730
destruction of park property!

03:40.730 --> 03:42.450
Oh sure, that one time!

03:42.520 --> 03:45.530
A general waste of time, energy, and space!

03:46.070 --> 03:48.610
Anyone who reads this is gonna think we're complete tools!

03:50.040 --> 03:50.980
No they're not.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.230
Let's change this stupid book.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.650
Mordecai and Rigby are my two favorite employees.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.690
Let me try!

03:57.760 --> 04:00.330
Every morning Mordecai and Rigby make blueberry pancakes,

04:00.330 --> 04:02.120
do the dishes, and wash the floor.

04:02.550 --> 04:04.810
I save all my hardest jobs for them!

04:05.090 --> 04:07.760
They're always sweating from all the hard work they do!

04:08.580 --> 04:10.820
They're the most reliable guys I ever met!

04:10.820 --> 04:13.090
I trust them with my own life!

04:13.110 --> 04:15.030
Wait, wait. I got one. Check it!

04:15.030 --> 04:17.149
There was this blizzard, and Skips broke his leg,

04:17.149 --> 04:20.130
but it didn't matter because Mordecai and Rigby took him to the hospital!

04:20.510 --> 04:22.740
They totally took him to the hospital!

04:22.740 --> 04:25.540
Yeah, the emergency part of the hospital!

04:25.540 --> 04:29.050
Then they were suddenly attacked by Snowballs the Ice Monster!

04:29.050 --> 04:31.290
It was like 20 feet tall with-

04:33.060 --> 04:35.320
Dude, it's Benson. Dude, we gotta get out of here.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.440
- Wait, I'm not done! - Rigby!

04:40.320 --> 04:41.610
There it is!

04:49.960 --> 04:52.160
Aw man! I didn't get to write the ending!

04:52.160 --> 04:54.800
Whatever dude. It's not like anyone is gonna believe that stuff.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.400
Just be glad we didn't get caught.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.790
Are those pancakes? I smell pancakes.

05:01.430 --> 05:04.540
Blueberry? Man, those smell good.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.900
- Yeah. Who's makin' 'em? - What are you two slackers-

05:11.260 --> 05:13.760
Wow Rigby, those smell great!

05:13.760 --> 05:16.300
- Yeah, but... - Are they ready yet? I'm starving.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.200
Ugh, sure.

05:21.260 --> 05:24.170
Rigby, these are incredible!

05:25.040 --> 05:26.870
Thanks! You made my morning!

05:27.010 --> 05:29.230
Oh no! Oh no you didn't!

05:29.310 --> 05:32.700
- Did you guys do the dishes too?! - Ugh, yeah.

05:32.770 --> 05:35.150
- And you washed the floor?! - Yeah!

05:35.180 --> 05:38.480
Oh man I appreciate that, you know I do!

05:41.130 --> 05:44.530
I need reliable guys like you to do some hard jobs for me today.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.670
Are you in?

05:46.530 --> 05:48.160
Yeah...

06:24.570 --> 06:26.340
It's so hot.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.170
I can't stop sweating.

06:28.230 --> 06:32.290
Dude, is it just me, or does being appreciated blow?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.000
Yeah man. It's not worth it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.740
Mordecai! Rigby! Did you hear?

06:38.040 --> 06:41.100
There's to be a blizzard this afternoon!

06:41.150 --> 06:42.620
But it's the middle of Summer.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.490
I know, but look!

06:44.650 --> 06:46.930
I've already donned my snowshoes!

06:47.080 --> 06:48.550
Pfft, snow?

06:48.660 --> 06:51.040
Sounds like more crazy Pops talk to me, right?

06:51.040 --> 06:51.770
Yeah.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.490
This is crazy!

06:57.490 --> 07:00.060
Dude, I think it's the book!

07:00.060 --> 07:01.890
- What?! - Don't you get it?!

07:02.010 --> 07:06.290
The pancakes, Benson liking us, the work, this blizzard!

07:06.680 --> 07:08.000
Skips!

07:11.550 --> 07:14.140
Dude, how are we gonna find him?! I can't see anything!

07:14.190 --> 07:15.650
Just keep going!

07:18.450 --> 07:19.440
What was that?

07:21.250 --> 07:22.570
Skips!

07:26.360 --> 07:27.960
That's not good.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.330
Help me get him into the cart!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.570
Oh no! We're dead!

07:48.570 --> 07:49.450
Wait here!

07:49.480 --> 07:51.610
Mordecai! Come back!

07:58.260 --> 07:59.250
Look out!

08:09.820 --> 08:11.700
I don't remember writing that in the book.

08:19.410 --> 08:21.650
You had to say Snowballs the Ice Monster?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.140
He doesn't look that bad.

08:26.860 --> 08:30.040
Fire? You made him breathe fire?! Are you kidding?

08:31.560 --> 08:32.980
It's looking at us!

08:40.240 --> 08:41.740
This is all your fault!

08:41.740 --> 08:43.590
You were the one who wanted to change the book!

08:43.610 --> 08:46.130
You wrote lies in the Book of Park Records?

08:46.130 --> 08:46.880
Maybe...

08:46.880 --> 08:49.160
Yeah, well... You're the one who made me stop writing!

08:49.160 --> 08:52.450
That's gonna be a super sweet ending with bazooka and explosions, and a helicopter...

08:52.450 --> 08:53.510
Rigby, the book!

08:53.540 --> 08:56.600
If everything we write in the book comes true then all we need to do is...

08:56.880 --> 08:58.340
We gotta find Benson!

09:01.170 --> 09:03.170
Hey, just the guys I wanted to see.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.500
- I've got your appreciation plaques. - Not now!

09:05.500 --> 09:07.390
I'm gonna make everything go back to normal!

09:07.390 --> 09:09.440
Wait! You're not gonna change everything back, right?

09:09.440 --> 09:10.920
At least, leave some of the good stuff.

09:12.830 --> 09:13.840
The book!

09:19.010 --> 09:20.530
No!

09:26.430 --> 09:28.540
Mordecai, hurry! Write something!

09:28.640 --> 09:31.250
"...then the monster breathed fire on itself and he melted."

09:35.180 --> 09:37.090
"...and then the monster disappeared forever!"

09:39.670 --> 09:41.290
Why isn't it working?

09:42.740 --> 09:44.650
Because he still has the cover!

09:54.350 --> 09:55.530
Rigby!

10:03.890 --> 10:05.560
Mordecai, catch!

10:12.700 --> 10:15.510
"...and the monster went away and everything went back to normal."

10:27.290 --> 10:28.220
Rigby?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.350
Cool!

10:33.350 --> 10:34.500
I'll take that!

10:34.520 --> 10:36.330
I don't know what's been going on here

10:36.330 --> 10:38.410
or why you two jokers have my book,

10:38.410 --> 10:40.990
so you had better clean this mess up starting now

10:40.990 --> 10:42.930
or YOU'RE BOTH FIRED!

10:43.060 --> 10:44.030
What mess?

10:45.420 --> 10:47.810
Huh... We did all the job you asked us to do.

10:49.290 --> 10:50.950
Skips, let's get out of here.

10:55.470 --> 10:56.100
What?

10:56.340 --> 10:58.750
Still no appreciation plaques?
