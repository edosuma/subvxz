00:18.933 --> 00:21.268
Dear Diary, how are you?

00:21.269 --> 00:22.853
I am fine.

00:22.854 --> 00:24.187
Okay, I'm not fine.

00:24.188 --> 00:26.173
You got me. God, you're good.

00:26.174 --> 00:28.358
It's just... I'm 13
and never even ridden a horse.

00:28.359 --> 00:31.194
I mean, my imaginary horse,
Jericho's, great, of course,

00:31.195 --> 00:32.979
but I'm ready
for the real thing.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.698
And I've found
just the right place.

00:34.699 --> 00:37.483
It's the week-long Hoof Dreams
Horse Camp in Montana.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.569
You get to participate
in a live horse birth.

00:39.570 --> 00:40.954
And a sunrise ride
to the top of a mountain

00:40.955 --> 00:42.372
where a Native American
gives you

00:42.373 --> 00:43.990
an honorary horse-inspired name.

00:43.991 --> 00:45.876
And that at the end,
you get to keep the horse.

00:45.877 --> 00:48.462
So it's a really great bang
for your buck... ing... bronco.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.130
Just a little joke.

00:50.131 --> 00:52.332
Anyway, I just wish
there was some way

00:52.333 --> 00:54.417
I could express all this
to Mom and Dad.

00:54.502 --> 00:55.502
The end.

00:55.503 --> 00:56.586
Huh. Do people normally read

00:56.587 --> 00:58.004
their diary entries out loud?

00:58.005 --> 00:59.555
Oh. Did you guys hear that?

00:59.640 --> 01:01.675
How is Jericho
the imaginary horse these days?

01:01.676 --> 01:03.009
He's good.

01:03.010 --> 01:04.811
He just got his
imaginary bangs trimmed,

01:04.812 --> 01:06.680
and I think it's made
him much more confident.

01:06.681 --> 01:08.815
Look, we know you want
to go to that horse camp, Tina.

01:08.816 --> 01:10.484
You've left
pamphlets everywhere.

01:10.485 --> 01:12.853
Like here, under my food... ugh.

01:12.854 --> 01:14.020
Well, then you know
there's still time

01:14.021 --> 01:15.354
to sign me up this summer.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.073
And there's still
time to sign me up

01:17.074 --> 01:19.575
The ham
convention in Orlando.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.578
We just can't afford
horse camp, honey.

01:21.579 --> 01:23.112
It costs 2,000 bucks.

01:23.197 --> 01:24.831
Dad would have to work
until he was 90.

01:24.832 --> 01:26.365
That's in ten years, Tina.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.168
I'm not 80.
We barely have enough

01:28.169 --> 01:29.419
to fix the deep fryer, Tina.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.037
It's been broken for two days,

01:31.038 --> 01:34.040
so we've got to use...

01:34.041 --> 01:35.541
Tina, I'm sor...
‭

01:35.626 --> 01:38.044
Uh, I thought you
were done. Okay.

01:38.045 --> 01:39.296
All right.
Well, take your time.

01:39.297 --> 01:42.047
That's fine.
All right. That's fine.

01:44.602 --> 01:45.802
Hey, what's up, Tina?

01:45.803 --> 01:47.053
Why the long face?

01:47.054 --> 01:48.221
Hi, Jericho.

01:48.222 --> 01:49.523
It's just that I can't go

01:49.524 --> 01:51.357
to the Hoof Dreams Horse Camp,

01:51.392 --> 01:53.193
so now I'll probably be sad
for the rest of my life,

01:53.194 --> 01:54.727
but besides that I'm good.

01:54.812 --> 01:57.397
Oh, Tina, you have
the hardest life sometimes,

01:57.398 --> 01:59.399
and yet, you're so strong.
I know.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.117
Hey, who needs real horses,
anyway?

02:01.118 --> 02:02.451
Can a real horse do this?

02:05.656 --> 02:06.823
Probably not.

02:06.824 --> 02:08.039
Here. Move over.

02:08.074 --> 02:09.241
Hmm.
‭Just... little more.

02:09.243 --> 02:10.293
‭Scooch.

02:10.294 --> 02:11.461
Come on. A little more.

02:11.462 --> 02:12.746
I can't go anymore.

02:12.747 --> 02:13.997
I know what will cheer you up.

02:13.998 --> 02:15.081
Tell me the story of how we met.

02:15.082 --> 02:16.216
I don't know if I'm in the mood.

02:16.217 --> 02:17.417
Just kidding. I am.

02:17.418 --> 02:18.635
Oh, Tina.

02:18.636 --> 02:20.303
So there we were.

02:20.304 --> 02:21.838
Shipwrecked
on a deserted island.

02:21.839 --> 02:22.922
What was I like?

02:23.007 --> 02:24.341
You were wild.

02:26.177 --> 02:29.603
No one could tame you,
except one girl named me.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.264
Come on. Come on.

02:31.265 --> 02:32.399
No.
‭Come on. Come on.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.900
Nuh-uh. No.
‭Got some leaves.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.769
I'm wild.
‭I know, but look.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.521
I'm wild.
‭They're so good.

02:37.522 --> 02:39.022
I would never
eat out of your Han...

02:39.023 --> 02:40.273
Oh, my God, I'm doing it.

02:40.274 --> 02:42.192
Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup.

02:42.193 --> 02:43.577
Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup,

02:43.578 --> 02:44.494
Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup,

02:44.495 --> 02:46.161
Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup.

02:46.247 --> 02:47.914
Yay!

02:47.915 --> 02:49.332
You tamed me!

02:50.618 --> 02:51.835
I'm okay.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.426
Yikes.
Yeah.

02:59.427 --> 03:01.378
We got to get this girl
to horse camp.

03:01.379 --> 03:02.796
Pronto.

03:02.797 --> 03:05.097
So, yeah, just sell this stuff.

03:05.132 --> 03:06.633
Use the money to pay
for Tina's horse camp,

03:06.634 --> 03:07.717
and give us whatever's leftover.

03:07.718 --> 03:09.135
You're welcome.

03:09.136 --> 03:10.353
Guys, it's very sweet of you,

03:10.354 --> 03:11.805
but we're not
selling your stuff.

03:11.806 --> 03:13.189
Plus, no offense,
but I don't think

03:13.190 --> 03:14.140
it would cover the cost.

03:14.141 --> 03:15.941
I mean, this is a pinecone.

03:15.977 --> 03:17.560
Mr. Pinecone.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.403
We got to do something, people!

03:19.447 --> 03:20.981
You know we could push off

03:20.982 --> 03:22.816
fixing the deep fryer
for a few months,

03:22.817 --> 03:24.150
and use that money to send Tina

03:24.151 --> 03:26.036
to a cheaper horse camp
around here.

03:26.037 --> 03:27.370
Yeah, but we need
the deep fryer fixed.

03:27.371 --> 03:28.487
We need fries.

03:28.539 --> 03:29.906
Do you though, Dad? I mean,

03:29.907 --> 03:31.625
the restaurant's
called Bob's Burgers,

03:31.626 --> 03:33.325
not Bob's Burgers and Fries.

03:33.411 --> 03:35.629
Yeah, just 'cause fries
are salty and delicious

03:35.630 --> 03:36.830
and no one in history

03:36.831 --> 03:38.331
has ever eaten
a burger without them,

03:38.332 --> 03:40.000
doesn't mean
we should serve them.

03:40.001 --> 03:41.334
Come on, Bobby, please?

03:41.335 --> 03:42.836
For Tina?

03:42.837 --> 03:44.337
What the hell.
Let's do it.

03:44.338 --> 03:46.306
Maybe we don't
need fries... for now.

03:46.307 --> 03:47.507
Yeah, okay, yeah?

03:47.508 --> 03:48.892
All right!
‭Yeah!

03:48.893 --> 03:51.344
We're pushing off
the deep fryer repair.

03:51.345 --> 03:53.729
Our lives
are so exciting.

03:53.814 --> 03:55.682
Tina!

03:55.683 --> 03:57.443
Come here, baby.
We got something to tell ya!

03:59.687 --> 04:01.187
I know.
Time for breakfast.

04:01.188 --> 04:02.404
Thanks for including me.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.024
No. Not that. This.

04:05.076 --> 04:07.360
Great.
Now I need a spoon.

04:07.361 --> 04:08.861
Can anything ever go right?

04:08.946 --> 04:10.780
Tina.
Up here.

04:10.781 --> 04:12.021
For God's sake, look up, woman!

04:13.701 --> 04:15.452
Hurray!

04:17.088 --> 04:18.872
Sorry, my glasses are smudgy.

04:18.873 --> 04:20.539
Let me just clean them real quick.
‭Oh, my God.

04:20.625 --> 04:21.875
Hmm. Okay.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.093
"You're going to..."

04:24.178 --> 04:26.129
Now, it's not
the Montana one, sweetie,

04:26.130 --> 04:27.881
but it's
a very affordable day camp

04:27.882 --> 04:29.973
that's close by. Hurray!

04:31.552 --> 04:33.101
Did you... did you
hear that, Tina?

04:34.555 --> 04:35.604
Is she breathing?

04:35.690 --> 04:37.390
Did we kill her?

04:37.391 --> 04:39.309
I'm so happy.

04:39.310 --> 04:40.643
What? What she's saying?
What was that?

04:40.728 --> 04:42.612
- I'm so happy!
- Oh.

04:42.613 --> 04:44.397
Hooray! ‭All right! Horse camp!

04:44.398 --> 04:46.615
Ow, Tina. Too hard.

04:48.238 --> 04:50.022
Well, Jericho, this is it.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.690
My first day of horse camp.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.509
I'm finally going to get
to ride a real horse.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.978
Wow. I'm-I'm really
happy for you.

04:55.979 --> 04:58.347
I really treasure the time
we've had together.

04:58.348 --> 04:59.698
Me, too.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.033
And I'll never forget you.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.301
What's happening here?

05:03.369 --> 05:04.770
Oh, I just assume

05:04.771 --> 05:06.551
that when I get home,
you'll be gone.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.272
What? Why would you assume that?

05:08.341 --> 05:09.992
Because you're
an imaginary horse,

05:09.993 --> 05:11.743
and I'm about to ride
a real horse, and I just...

05:11.744 --> 05:13.128
What? No, no, no.
I'm not imaginary.

05:13.129 --> 05:14.663
You're the...
you're the imaginary one.

05:14.664 --> 05:15.998
Not me. You are!

05:15.999 --> 05:17.298
Jericho, please.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.917
Don't start that again.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.418
Last time you said it,
it really messed me up.

05:20.503 --> 05:22.254
But I'm real!
I'm real! I'm real!

05:22.255 --> 05:23.505
I'm real!

05:23.506 --> 05:24.672
Hey, hey.

05:24.724 --> 05:25.974
Come here.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.145
I didn't know this would
be our last day together.

05:30.146 --> 05:31.345
I know, let's make it count.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.898
What am I even wearing?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.316
Wearing cutoffs?

05:34.317 --> 05:36.185
I didn't even dress for this!

05:36.186 --> 05:37.653
You look great, Jericho.

05:37.654 --> 05:39.521
Oh, God.
‭There, there.

05:39.522 --> 05:40.856
There, there, there,
there, there.

05:40.857 --> 05:43.025
Oh, Tina!
‭Okay, okay, okay.

05:43.026 --> 05:44.359
All right.
‭Oh, Tina.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.526
All right.
I got to go.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.911
What?
I-I got to go. Bye.

05:46.996 --> 05:48.112
No, wait. Don't go.

05:48.198 --> 05:49.031
There, there. Bye.

05:49.032 --> 05:50.531
No, no, no. I got... no.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.750
I-I got to go. It's okay.

05:51.751 --> 05:52.951
I'll treasure you forever.

05:56.039 --> 05:58.373
I'll pick you up at 4:00, honey.

05:58.374 --> 06:00.175
Have a good first day
at horse camp.

06:00.176 --> 06:01.260
Thanks, Mom.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.128
I am home.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.182
Oh, hell neigh.

06:07.183 --> 06:08.934
Ugh.
‭Hi, Tina.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.435
Tammy, Jocelyn.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.951
What a fun surprise,
you guys are here.

06:13.022 --> 06:14.223
Well, it was either this

06:14.224 --> 06:15.474
or going to visit
my grandmother,

06:15.475 --> 06:16.975
and she's like older
than my parents.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.226
Ew, gross.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.195
Aw, one of my babies,

06:20.196 --> 06:21.812
finally going to camp.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.482
But what about Gene and Louise?

06:23.483 --> 06:25.701
Poor, no-camp Gene and Louise.

06:25.702 --> 06:28.453
It's so unfair. Unless...

06:28.454 --> 06:29.787
Oh, Linda! Watch the road.

06:29.872 --> 06:31.240
There you go, Teddy.

06:31.241 --> 06:32.741
Great. Where are the fries?

06:32.742 --> 06:34.576
Teddy, remember?
We used the deep fryer money

06:34.577 --> 06:35.910
for Tina's horse camp, so...

06:35.962 --> 06:37.212
Right. Right.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.964
Tina's horse camp. I get it.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.632
We all got to make sacrifices,

06:40.633 --> 06:42.668
like the taste of
those crispy fries in my mouth,

06:42.669 --> 06:44.253
absorbing my sadness.

06:44.254 --> 06:45.554
Teddy.
‭Nope, you're right.

06:45.555 --> 06:46.888
Tina's going to horse camp.

06:46.889 --> 06:49.424
That's great.
She's a good kid.

06:49.425 --> 06:51.093
I hope she's having
a real good time, Bob!

06:51.094 --> 06:52.176
All right, Teddy.
Calm down.

06:52.262 --> 06:53.594
Linda, what are you wearing?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.646
Don't worry, Bob.
I got it all worked out.

06:55.732 --> 06:57.482
All what worked out?

06:57.483 --> 06:58.850
Ow.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.352
Gene, Louise, listen up.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.321
Tina's not the only one
going to camp.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.489
Turns out we're sending you
off to camp, too.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.991
W-wait. We are?

07:05.992 --> 07:06.991
You are? ‭Yeah.

07:07.076 --> 07:08.860
You're going to...

07:08.861 --> 07:10.112
Da, da, da, da...

07:10.113 --> 07:11.612
Restaurant Camp.

07:11.698 --> 07:12.447
Oh.
‭Huh.

07:12.448 --> 07:13.614
Restaurant Camp?

07:13.666 --> 07:15.951
Uh, Gene, private meeting.
‭Where?

07:15.952 --> 07:18.003
Behind this menu.
Okay, I'll be right there.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.038
Whatever it is
that Mom's proposing,

07:20.039 --> 07:21.206
we should do it,
'cause maybe it'll

07:21.207 --> 07:22.624
get us out of work.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.509
It's not work
when you love what you do,

07:24.510 --> 07:26.295
which we don't, so yeah.

07:26.296 --> 07:27.596
Lin, behind the menu, now.
What, what?

07:27.597 --> 07:28.964
What are we talking about, guys?

07:28.965 --> 07:31.266
The fry situation's gotten
out of control, agree?

07:31.267 --> 07:32.768
No, we're not talking
about that now.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.269
Lin, what's Restaurant Camp?

07:34.270 --> 07:36.471
It's like regular camp,
but in the restaurant.

07:36.472 --> 07:38.774
But the restaurant
is in the restaurant.

07:38.775 --> 07:40.475
But this is Restaurant Camp.

07:40.476 --> 07:42.060
Why is this so hard for you?

07:42.061 --> 07:44.061
It's the only way to make
it fair for all the kids.

07:44.113 --> 07:45.614
Okay, uh, guys?

07:45.615 --> 07:46.648
Wh-where are you?

07:46.649 --> 07:47.866
Right here, behind the menu.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.089
Oh, listen.

07:49.118 --> 07:50.402
We're in. Sorry Dad.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.320
We'd love to finish
with all this,

07:51.321 --> 07:53.154
but we're off to camp.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.488
Hello.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.208
I'm Doris, your instructor.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.328
And welcome to
Horsing Around Riding Center,

07:59.329 --> 08:02.047
where a horse is a horse,
of course, of course.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.082
I'm contractually
obligated to say that.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.134
If it's a reference,
I don't recognize it.

08:06.135 --> 08:07.385
Let's get started.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.588
First horse sighting. Nice.

08:10.673 --> 08:13.488
So this here is Duchess,
and she is a...

08:13.509 --> 08:15.509
Palomino. 13 hands high. No 14.

08:15.561 --> 08:16.761
Uh, correct.

08:16.846 --> 08:19.398
Let's go over some terminology,
shall we?

08:19.399 --> 08:20.719
Uh, does anyone know
what this is?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.601
The withers.
‭Uh-huh.

08:22.602 --> 08:23.652
Can anyone tell me what...
The crest.

08:23.653 --> 08:25.820
But how about...

08:25.855 --> 08:27.906
The chestnut. Bony part
of the inner side of the leg.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.573
Muscular part
of the hind leg.

08:29.659 --> 08:31.193
Well, why don't we let

08:31.194 --> 08:32.577
one of the other girls
try to answer.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.883
You, what's this?

08:33.946 --> 08:35.246
Um, horse.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.697
The croup.
It's the croup.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.332
All right, uh,

08:38.333 --> 08:40.418
let's get out a saddle
and take a look at it.

08:40.503 --> 08:43.371
Jeez, Tina, you're such
a horse ass kissperer.

08:43.373 --> 08:45.040
Well, Tammy, I happen
to have done

08:45.041 --> 08:46.675
many hours of research
on the Internet,

08:46.676 --> 08:47.926
and on my imaginary
horse, Jericho.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.261
Wait, what did you say?

08:49.262 --> 08:50.429
Your what?

08:50.430 --> 08:51.880
My imaginary horse.

08:51.881 --> 08:54.466
Don't you... all...
have... one?

08:54.467 --> 08:56.435
I can see by your faces
that you don't,

08:56.436 --> 08:57.886
and neither do I,
so that's settled.

08:57.887 --> 08:59.388
Imaginary horse, what?

08:59.389 --> 09:01.188
Oh, look. A cloud.

09:01.224 --> 09:02.607
She's right.

09:02.608 --> 09:03.892
Now,

09:03.893 --> 09:05.610
full disclosure,
I've never been to camp.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.062
Promising start.

09:07.063 --> 09:08.563
But I've seen a lot

09:08.564 --> 09:10.532
of camp movies, so we're fine.

09:10.533 --> 09:11.900
And our first activity

09:11.901 --> 09:14.069
of the day is arts and crafts.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.370
We're going to make God's eyes

09:15.371 --> 09:17.037
out of everyday
restaurant straws.

09:17.073 --> 09:19.040
I want to make
my God's eye winking,

09:19.041 --> 09:20.742
so it looks like
God's flirting with me.

09:20.743 --> 09:23.628
Now, it's very simple,
I'm assuming.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.248
Just got to weave
them together and...

09:26.249 --> 09:27.581
Hmm. All right.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.500
This is hard to watch.

09:29.585 --> 09:30.886
Hey, hey!

09:30.887 --> 09:32.137
What, Teddy?

09:32.138 --> 09:33.505
You fix the deep fryer, yet?!

09:33.506 --> 09:35.223
No, Teddy, it's been,
like, two hours.

09:35.224 --> 09:36.675
Well, fix it.!

09:36.676 --> 09:38.009
It's fine. Y-you really
don't need fries, sir.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.594
T-trust me.

09:39.595 --> 09:41.645
Please don't look so sad.
We're trying.

09:41.731 --> 09:44.266
Okay, horse assignments
for the week.

09:44.267 --> 09:45.767
Jocelyn, you'll be with our

09:45.768 --> 09:47.686
least difficult horse,
Blackjack.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.070
Where's his head?

09:49.071 --> 09:50.522
Oh, he's just looking
the other way.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.990
Tammy, you'll be with Dragonfly.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.575
Can I get another one?

09:53.576 --> 09:54.776
This one completely clashes
with my outfit.

09:54.777 --> 09:56.111
No.

09:56.112 --> 09:57.362
Tina, since you've demonstrated

09:57.363 --> 09:58.780
so much knowledge,

09:58.781 --> 10:00.115
I'm thinking you'll
be able to handle

10:00.116 --> 10:01.888
one of our more
challenging horses.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.890
Time to make a soul connection.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.171
Meet Plops.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.338
Oh.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.124
Plops. What a pretty name.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.342
Why is he called Pl...

10:11.511 --> 10:12.878
Okay. That makes sense.

10:12.879 --> 10:13.961
Alison, you're with Sugarcube.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.380
Okay, bond with him.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.547
Maybe open with a joke.

10:16.632 --> 10:17.766
Knock-knock.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.050
And then you say, "who's there?"

10:19.051 --> 10:20.719
Then I say, Orange.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.354
And then you say, "Orange who?"

10:22.355 --> 10:23.805
You turn away from me, um, okay.

10:23.806 --> 10:25.307
I'm just going to...
follow you.

10:25.308 --> 10:26.725
Do you want to just stand
still for a second,

10:26.726 --> 10:28.727
hear this funny joke?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.811
Oops. There you go.
Classic Plops.

10:30.897 --> 10:31.896
Oh...

10:31.948 --> 10:33.198
isn't floor-canoeing

10:33.199 --> 10:34.282
fun, campers?

10:34.283 --> 10:35.484
It's flanoeing.

10:35.485 --> 10:36.867
My oars are sore.

10:36.953 --> 10:38.675
Excuse me, just trying to get

10:38.738 --> 10:40.038
to the bathroom here.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.122
Uh, Linda, can I talk to you?

10:41.123 --> 10:42.122
Sure.

10:42.158 --> 10:43.492
Keep canoeing, kids.

10:43.493 --> 10:45.181
Stay there, I'll swim to you.
So...

10:45.211 --> 10:47.829
Camp Restaurant is, uh, great.

10:47.830 --> 10:49.464
Restaurant Camp, yes.

10:49.465 --> 10:50.916
That's what... yeah.
‭Right...

10:50.917 --> 10:52.717
but don't you think
the camp is a little in the way?

10:52.718 --> 10:55.253
What?! No, no, no, no.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.859
Besides, look how much
fun the kids are having.

10:59.509 --> 11:00.592
Uh-huh, uh, yeah.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.977
So, how long is camp?

11:01.978 --> 11:03.678
- Like five more minutes?
- Hey,

11:03.679 --> 11:06.097
is there some kind of
a free camp going on here?

11:06.098 --> 11:07.098
There sure is.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.099
Great, hey, kids, have fun.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.149
J-Jimmy, wait, I...

11:09.185 --> 11:10.184
Yay!
‭Yay!

11:10.236 --> 11:11.235
Oh, boy.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.938
Okay, we're about to

11:12.939 --> 11:14.739
begin the riding lessons,

11:14.740 --> 11:18.076
and on the last day there
will be a riding exhibition,

11:18.077 --> 11:20.445
for your parents
to take pictures at.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.997
Now, time to mount.

11:21.998 --> 11:24.032
It's just like
getting on a horse.

11:24.033 --> 11:26.083
Sorry, I don't have
any analogies.

11:26.168 --> 11:27.619
This is really happening.

11:30.706 --> 11:32.206
‭Oh.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.376
Okay, let's get
our horses to walk.

11:34.377 --> 11:35.709
Squeeze with your heels.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.845
Squeezing.

11:36.846 --> 11:38.046
Come on, Plops.

11:39.715 --> 11:42.182
Tina, you seem to be
not moving at all.

11:42.218 --> 11:43.935
Is that what you were going for?

11:43.936 --> 11:45.437
No, not exactly.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.305
Okay, officially riding.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.356
Wait, where are you going?

11:49.392 --> 11:51.109
'Cause it kind of seems like
you're headed right for

11:51.110 --> 11:52.443
the fence, fence, fence.

11:52.528 --> 11:53.562
Take control, Tina.

11:53.563 --> 11:54.896
He's trying to scrape you off.

11:54.897 --> 11:56.448
No, we're getting along great.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.566
My knee's turned around!

11:57.567 --> 11:58.838
Nope, just my pants. I'm fine.

11:58.901 --> 12:00.235
Hey, Tina, maybe you thought

12:00.236 --> 12:01.453
this was fencing camp.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.621
I don't get it.

12:03.706 --> 12:04.739
Ow, I'm okay.

12:04.740 --> 12:05.707
Ow, no, I'm not.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.292
Ow, yes, I am.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.807
Ow, everything's great, ow.
Yay, horse camp!

12:10.697 --> 12:13.918
Boy, what a great first day
at Restaurant Camp, huh, kids?

12:13.919 --> 12:15.852
Any thoughts? Comments?

12:15.921 --> 12:17.237
Our counselor
wears short shorts!

12:17.306 --> 12:19.040
Okay...

12:19.041 --> 12:21.008
Hey, Tina, you haven't
said a word about horse camp.

12:21.009 --> 12:22.209
How was it, hon?

12:22.210 --> 12:24.345
Good, really good.
Great!

12:24.346 --> 12:26.547
Just because my horse, Plops,
hates me and stepped on my foot,

12:26.548 --> 12:28.215
and bit my hair,
and peed all over my backpack,

12:28.216 --> 12:30.383
doesn't mean that I'm not having
a great time.

12:30.469 --> 12:31.435
Wait, what?

12:31.436 --> 12:32.937
Tina, that's horrible.

12:32.938 --> 12:34.555
Tina, you know,
you could always...

12:34.556 --> 12:36.316
Do anything and everything
to win Plops over?

12:36.358 --> 12:38.191
Um... I was gonna say quit?

12:38.226 --> 12:39.477
Oh, father.

12:39.478 --> 12:41.144
There's no quit in horse.

12:41.229 --> 12:43.898
It's just that if you
quit today, we get a refund,

12:43.899 --> 12:45.733
but if you quit tomorrow,
we don't.

12:45.734 --> 12:47.428
It's just something I read
very carefully in the contract.

12:47.486 --> 12:49.452
Go back to law school, Matlock.

12:49.538 --> 12:52.073
Okay, I think I'm done
with dinner, so I'll just

12:52.074 --> 12:55.042
be in my room, icing my foot,
bandaging some things,

12:55.043 --> 12:56.763
and gearing up
for an exciting day tomorrow!

12:58.080 --> 12:59.630
Sounds like a plan.
Cool limp.

12:59.631 --> 13:00.998
Thanks.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.632
You can do this.

13:02.718 --> 13:04.584
Bring on that Tina-risma.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.087
Hey, Plops.

13:06.088 --> 13:08.421
Look what
your best friend Tina has.

13:08.473 --> 13:10.474
An apple.

13:10.475 --> 13:12.161
Oh, and what's this?

13:12.227 --> 13:14.260
A framed picture of me, huh.

13:14.312 --> 13:16.430
We could just, I don't know,
put this up in your stall

13:16.431 --> 13:19.600
somewhere, so you can maybe
look at it when I'm not here?

13:19.601 --> 13:21.819
Oops, uh, looks like you knocked
it out of my hand there.

13:21.820 --> 13:22.986
Let me just...

13:23.071 --> 13:24.298
Damn it, Plops!

13:24.322 --> 13:26.023
You're gonna let me in.

13:26.024 --> 13:28.325
Also, I brought
a back-up picture just in case.

13:29.911 --> 13:31.612
♪ Camp ♪

13:31.613 --> 13:33.447
♪ Camp ♪

13:33.448 --> 13:35.449
♪ Camp ♪

13:35.450 --> 13:37.001
♪ Camp ♪

13:37.002 --> 13:38.119
♪ Camp! ♪

13:38.120 --> 13:40.204
Okay, a camp camp-out,

13:40.205 --> 13:41.788
so exciting,

13:41.840 --> 13:44.291
but I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.959
That that lighting
is not flattering?

13:46.011 --> 13:47.094
No.

13:47.095 --> 13:48.796
I'm worried about Apron Face.

13:48.797 --> 13:51.132
You see, Apron Face
used to go to this camp,

13:51.133 --> 13:52.716
and now he haunts this place.

13:52.801 --> 13:54.620
Why is he called Apron Face?

13:54.636 --> 13:56.603
He has an apron over his face.

13:56.638 --> 13:58.166
There's got to be
another reason.

13:58.190 --> 14:00.558
There isn't, and all the other

14:00.559 --> 14:01.976
campers made fun of him.

14:01.977 --> 14:03.944
So, one night,
he took his revenge.

14:03.945 --> 14:05.506
He spatula-ed them all to death!

14:05.564 --> 14:06.863
You know what,

14:06.948 --> 14:09.150
I just got to
step out for a minute.

14:09.151 --> 14:11.485
So, Restaurant Camp
is fun, right?

14:11.486 --> 14:12.987
We're honestly asking.
We-we don't know.

14:12.988 --> 14:14.955
Fun?
‭Yeah.

14:14.956 --> 14:15.740
No, no, no, no, no.
‭No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:15.741 --> 14:16.956
No?

14:16.992 --> 14:19.020
Uh-uh, you see,
Restaurant Camp gets us

14:19.077 --> 14:20.628
out of work, so...

14:20.629 --> 14:22.663
Uh-huh... wait, what?

14:22.664 --> 14:24.465
Okay, if we were ranking things,

14:24.466 --> 14:25.966
it would go
everything in the world...

14:25.967 --> 14:27.168
Mm-hmm.
‭Mm-hmm.

14:27.169 --> 14:29.003
...then Restaurant Camp
way down here...

14:29.004 --> 14:30.087
Mm-hmm.
‭Mm-hmm.

14:30.088 --> 14:31.505
...then a little
below that, work.

14:31.506 --> 14:34.224
And a little below
that, uh, genocide.

14:34.309 --> 14:35.893
Ah, now I get it.

14:35.894 --> 14:37.330
The visual was
helpful, thank you.

14:39.598 --> 14:40.848
Wow, Apron Face!

14:40.849 --> 14:41.932
That was actually pretty scary.

14:41.933 --> 14:42.932
Yeah.

14:42.934 --> 14:44.851
Okay, time for bed!

14:44.903 --> 14:46.270
Are we not doing s'mores?

14:46.271 --> 14:47.738
No s'mores, go to sleep!

14:47.739 --> 14:49.023
Okay. Good night.

14:49.024 --> 14:51.158
Bye, Tina, my good one.

14:51.159 --> 14:53.243
See you this afternoon
for your riding exhibition.

14:53.328 --> 14:54.912
Can't wait.
Super excited.

14:54.913 --> 14:56.224
Oh, and have a good last day
at Restaurant Camp.

15:00.035 --> 15:04.537
Look at us, Plops, having
a nice, pleasant trail ride.

15:04.623 --> 15:06.340
I think someone's starting
to like old Tina.

15:06.341 --> 15:07.707
Ow!

15:07.759 --> 15:09.844
Still a little bit
of tension there.

15:09.845 --> 15:12.949
Maybe it's time for
Mr. Apple to pay another visit.

15:13.014 --> 15:14.882
Okay, we're gonna trot.

15:14.883 --> 15:16.550
Now there's a fork
in the trail up here,

15:16.551 --> 15:19.470
so keep control of your horse
and stick to the right!

15:22.057 --> 15:23.389
Whoops!

15:30.371 --> 15:32.422
Everybody still back there?

15:32.423 --> 15:34.958
Yes!

15:36.794 --> 15:38.795
Bobby, look over there.
Don't look at me.

15:38.796 --> 15:40.180
What, why?
‭Don't look at me!

15:40.181 --> 15:41.515
Huh, you brought fries?

15:41.516 --> 15:42.599
Yeah, I brought fries.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
Where'd you get them from?

15:43.601 --> 15:45.469
I-I'd rather not say.

15:45.470 --> 15:46.970
Wait a second,
those are crinkle cut.

15:46.971 --> 15:48.722
Did you get fries
from across the street?

15:48.723 --> 15:51.474
Did you bring Jimmy Pesto's
fries into my restaurant?!

15:51.526 --> 15:52.526
You did this!

15:52.527 --> 15:53.976
Fix your damn fryer, Bob!

15:54.062 --> 15:55.812
You want it fixed, Teddy?!
Fix it yourself!

15:55.813 --> 15:57.030
Huh, handy man?!

15:57.031 --> 15:58.031
I will fix it!

15:58.032 --> 15:59.399
I'm going in the kitchen.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.983
You don't have any tools, Teddy!

16:01.035 --> 16:02.152
I know what I'm doing!

16:03.988 --> 16:05.872
Teddy, it sounds like
you're just shaking it.

16:05.873 --> 16:07.908
I got my own process, Bob!

16:09.243 --> 16:10.660
Ugh, kids, what are you doing?

16:10.745 --> 16:12.329
We're making a napkin swamp.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.665
We're just pouring water on
a bunch of napkins, basically.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.415
It's like being
back on the bayou.

16:16.501 --> 16:17.551
Well, you're making
a giant mess.

16:17.552 --> 16:18.919
W-where's your mom?

16:18.920 --> 16:20.253
What happened
to Restaurant Camp?

16:20.254 --> 16:22.339
Mom said the last day of
camp was a free day.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.602
She's in the basement
grinding meat.

16:23.675 --> 16:24.891
Get out of work,

16:24.892 --> 16:26.225
well, I'll show you.

16:26.311 --> 16:28.645
Uh-oh, looks like
there was a murder!

16:28.646 --> 16:30.526
Napkin Swamp.

16:30.598 --> 16:31.932
Stop! You know what?

16:31.933 --> 16:33.567
Restaurant Camp is cancelled.

16:33.568 --> 16:35.185
Just... everybody, go upstairs.

16:35.186 --> 16:36.770
Go upstairs and do what?

16:36.771 --> 16:38.604
Whatever you want, just go.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.746
So, no Restaurant Camp
and no restaurant?

16:41.826 --> 16:43.193
And no pants?

16:43.194 --> 16:45.112
Keep them on
till you're upstairs!

16:46.364 --> 16:47.864
The power of Christ compels you!

16:47.865 --> 16:49.832
The power of...

16:51.035 --> 16:53.419
So much galloping!

16:53.504 --> 16:55.037
Branch, branch!

16:56.257 --> 16:58.508
Plops!

16:58.509 --> 17:00.043
This is the life, huh, Gene?

17:00.044 --> 17:02.433
Good-bye, restaurant,
good-bye, Restaurant Camp.

17:02.463 --> 17:04.263
Good-bye, arts and crafts.

17:04.265 --> 17:06.883
I mean, I am happy with how
my god's eye straw bra came out.

17:06.884 --> 17:09.636
God's getting an eyeful,
but, uh, yeah.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.721
No more, thank you.

17:10.722 --> 17:12.388
I did kind of like Apron Face,

17:12.390 --> 17:14.022
and it may be my Halloween
costume this year,

17:14.058 --> 17:16.393
but, yeah, good riddance.

17:16.394 --> 17:17.894
Yup.
‭Yup.

17:17.895 --> 17:18.944
Mm-hmm.

17:18.945 --> 17:21.397
Mm-hmm.

17:21.398 --> 17:22.661
We miss Restaurant Camp.

17:22.733 --> 17:23.867
What?

17:23.867 --> 17:25.233
It gave us
structure and purpose,

17:25.319 --> 17:26.737
and it got us inner-city kids

17:26.738 --> 17:28.291
out of the city for a change.

17:28.373 --> 17:30.240
You-you miss Restaurant Camp?

17:30.241 --> 17:32.075
What do you mean
you miss Restaurant Camp?

17:32.076 --> 17:34.493
I kind of shut it down
and told them to go upstairs.

17:34.579 --> 17:35.629
Of course!

17:35.630 --> 17:36.997
It all makes sense!

17:36.998 --> 17:38.665
It's a classic camp movie story.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.083
The kids just needed
to have the camp

17:40.084 --> 17:42.252
taken away from them
by Old Man Belcher.

17:42.253 --> 17:43.470
The bastard!

17:43.471 --> 17:45.138
He can go to hell!
Kids.

17:45.139 --> 17:47.090
There must be some
way we can convince

17:47.091 --> 17:49.059
Old Man Belcher
not to shut us down.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.310
- Bastard.
- Gene.

17:50.311 --> 17:52.012
Oh, we got to do a show.

17:52.013 --> 17:54.848
A camp show with skits
and songs and skit songs.

17:54.849 --> 17:56.149
It's perfect!

17:56.150 --> 17:58.364
So, how about it,
Old Man Belcher?

17:58.436 --> 18:01.188
Uh...

18:01.189 --> 18:02.355
These skits better

18:02.356 --> 18:03.740
be pretty damn good.

18:03.741 --> 18:04.691
Yay! ‭Yay! ‭Yay!

18:05.660 --> 18:08.624
Plops?

18:08.663 --> 18:10.864
Anyone?

18:10.865 --> 18:12.294
Doris?

18:12.333 --> 18:13.629
Hello?

18:13.701 --> 18:15.284
Plops!

18:15.336 --> 18:16.632

18:39.694 --> 18:41.560
The camp stays open.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.312
Hurray!

18:43.364 --> 18:44.648
That was so moving.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.149
Changing the subject,

18:46.150 --> 18:47.534
turns out I cannot
fix the deep fryer,

18:47.535 --> 18:48.568
but who needs fries?

18:48.569 --> 18:50.036
Chips.

18:50.037 --> 18:51.121
You guys have chips, Bob?

18:51.122 --> 18:52.289
Uh, no.
‭Damn it!

18:52.290 --> 18:53.457
Are you serious?!

18:53.458 --> 18:54.458
Oh, my God, what time is it?

18:54.459 --> 18:55.992
We're late for Tina's

18:55.993 --> 18:57.293
riding exhibition thingy!
We got to go!

18:57.328 --> 19:00.175
Okay, Jocelyn, let's see a turn!

19:00.248 --> 19:02.219
Look, Mom, I'm on a horse.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.216
I know.

19:03.217 --> 19:05.802
Oh, good, we found you.

19:05.803 --> 19:08.472
Not really, I kind
of just walked back here.

19:08.473 --> 19:10.340
Well, uh, Plops is in his stall.

19:10.341 --> 19:11.478
Oh, good.

19:11.509 --> 19:13.425
Jocelyn, finish up with a trot!

19:13.511 --> 19:15.177
Okay.

19:15.263 --> 19:16.596
Tina, come on, get Plops.

19:16.597 --> 19:17.647
You're next.

19:23.104 --> 19:24.938
Hey, Tina.

19:24.939 --> 19:25.938
Need a ride?

19:25.990 --> 19:27.239
Jericho, you're here.

19:27.325 --> 19:28.909
How about you drop the Plops

19:28.910 --> 19:30.609
and make the swap?

19:30.695 --> 19:32.445
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

19:32.446 --> 19:34.664
Doris, I'm not going
to ride Plops.

19:34.665 --> 19:36.866
I brought my own horse.
‭Huh?

19:36.918 --> 19:38.618
His name is Jericho,
and I don't know

19:38.619 --> 19:40.370
if you can tell,
but he's imaginary.

19:40.371 --> 19:43.205
I want to ride on a horse that loves
me because I deserve that.

19:43.257 --> 19:45.040
Um...

19:45.126 --> 19:46.626
Did we miss it?
Did we miss it?

19:46.627 --> 19:48.461
No, looks like Tina's
just about to start,

19:48.462 --> 19:49.879
but wait, where's Plops?

19:49.931 --> 19:53.132
So... mount your...

19:53.217 --> 19:54.300
uh...
I'll take it from here, Doris.

19:54.385 --> 19:55.384
Oh, all right, yeah.

19:59.273 --> 20:01.107
She's riding Jericho.

20:01.108 --> 20:02.279
She-she's doing what?

20:02.360 --> 20:04.226
Turning!

20:06.314 --> 20:07.897
Let's see this pony run.

20:09.951 --> 20:11.997
God, her form is perfect.

20:12.069 --> 20:13.485
Taking this jump!

20:13.571 --> 20:15.167
What jump?
What's going on?

20:15.239 --> 20:17.540
Taking a higher jump!

20:20.628 --> 20:21.661
I'm okay.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.412
A little too high.

20:23.464 --> 20:24.998
She got back on.

20:24.999 --> 20:26.415
She's so brave.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.668
So, we paid all
that money for Tina

20:28.669 --> 20:30.754
to ride an imaginary horse.

20:30.755 --> 20:33.389
Yeah, but look how happy she is.

20:33.424 --> 20:35.008
She's beautiful out there.

20:35.009 --> 20:36.475
Yeah, she is.

20:36.561 --> 20:38.144
Dad, I want an imaginary horse.

20:38.145 --> 20:39.596
I-I-I'll find you one
right away, honey.

20:39.597 --> 20:40.596
I'll m-make a call, hold on.

20:40.597 --> 20:42.399
Yay, that's my daughter!

20:42.400 --> 20:43.900
Way to go, Tina!

20:43.901 --> 20:45.935
I love my weird, brave sister!
‭Ride,

20:45.987 --> 20:47.988
