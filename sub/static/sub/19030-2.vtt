00:04.805 --> 00:05.578
Hi!

00:05.871 --> 00:08.754
I'm trying to keep a non-medical
personnel from coming back here.

00:09.799 --> 00:11.011
I'm the Chief of Medicine.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.954
And I'm the Chief of Slag Smacking,

00:13.037 --> 00:14.730
so I'd keep moving
if I were you.

00:14.918 --> 00:16.171
That's very clever.

00:16.305 --> 00:18.545
Being clever is
not how I got the job.

00:18.587 --> 00:20.237
Smacking slags is.

00:20.342 --> 00:21.972
<i>Unfortunately for Jordan,</i>

00:22.013 --> 00:25.168
<i>Dr. Maddox can zero in on
someone's biggest insecurity.</i>

00:25.523 --> 00:27.440
- You're old.
- Oh!

00:28.574 --> 00:31.394
<i>See, she was an oncombination
of super-friendly...</i>

00:31.520 --> 00:32.668
Hey, rockstar!

00:32.857 --> 00:34.215
<i>...and soul-less.</i>

00:34.361 --> 00:36.164
This guy's insurance
only covers three days

00:36.234 --> 00:38.895
of 'Why so you care?', so you gotta
get him out of here today, okay?

00:39.145 --> 00:39.835
And you know what?

00:40.169 --> 00:41.094
I'll take care of it.

00:44.199 --> 00:46.782
Oh, do you know what I did
for the first time last week?

00:46.864 --> 00:48.162
Wind surfing.

00:48.299 --> 00:50.786
By the way,
it is really... aargh!

00:50.814 --> 00:52.440
I wouldn't know about that.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.433
Trust me, it is.

00:58.388 --> 00:59.577
This guy!

01:00.808 --> 01:01.990
Die! Got you!

01:02.940 --> 01:06.448
God! Won't you die?!

01:07.965 --> 01:09.003
Treat him and streed (sp?) him.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.256
<i>And she wasn't the only woman
who was driving me crazy.</i>

01:12.888 --> 01:13.940
Listen, Jo...

01:14.077 --> 01:16.592
Medically speaking,
your performance is outstanding.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.587
But you're not
great with your patients.

01:18.751 --> 01:19.475
Watch Ed.

01:19.749 --> 01:21.744
See, he develops a rapport.

01:22.075 --> 01:23.742
Now I know Ed's not perfect...

01:24.153 --> 01:27.146
Matrix! All three movies,
one house. You in?

01:27.187 --> 01:27.733
Sure.

01:27.884 --> 01:28.922
Sorry, no room.

01:29.537 --> 01:31.765
For starters,
I heard he smokes plants.

01:32.337 --> 01:35.932
Still, I need you to connect
with your patients, okay?

01:36.123 --> 01:37.844
If they need some sympathy,

01:38.078 --> 01:40.401
dig down in your soul and find some?

01:41.440 --> 01:42.492
Yo, Mr. Harris?

01:42.625 --> 01:43.909
Sucks you'll never walk again.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.973
Hell yeah, awesome!

01:47.126 --> 01:48.023
Better, right?

01:48.201 --> 01:49.363
No, no, Jo...

01:49.458 --> 01:50.319
He lost his feet.

01:50.456 --> 01:52.192
<i>I don't have time for Jo,</i>

01:52.250 --> 01:54.847
<i>because once a year,
Turk and I go to a great steakhouse</i>

01:54.915 --> 01:57.307
<i>and have the most
romantic night ever.</i>

01:57.308 --> 01:57.799
Dude!

01:57.908 --> 02:00.136
<i>And that magical
evening was finally here.</i>

02:00.423 --> 02:02.678
Steak Night!

02:02.724 --> 02:03.865
- Give me some of this! Oh!
- Oh!

02:04.941 --> 02:07.423
How come I don't know about
that super-tight new greeting?

02:07.642 --> 02:08.994
Steak Night!

02:08.975 --> 02:10.538
It's not a greeting, Ed.

02:10.703 --> 02:11.646
It is now.

02:11.769 --> 02:12.439
Sean!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.450
Steak Night!

02:15.353 --> 02:16.829
How does he start
things so quickly?

02:16.883 --> 02:18.346
He is very talented.

02:18.551 --> 02:22.050
May your mushrooms always be sautéed
and your onions always be grilled.

02:22.383 --> 02:23.831
Gravy, fellas!

02:24.172 --> 02:24.842
Gravy, Ed.

02:24.951 --> 02:26.264
Cream spinach, yo!

02:26.414 --> 02:27.538
- No.
- Okay.

02:30.702 --> 02:33.345
'My Last Words'

VO Made and Edited by: VeRdiKT
[subscene.com]

02:45.153 --> 02:45.727
Dude.

02:46.739 --> 02:48.844
You've seen the new
administrative assistant?

02:49.144 --> 02:51.823
<i>For some reason, whenever I see
a pretty girl, for the first time,</i>

02:51.864 --> 02:54.201
<i>I always imagine her
hair blowing in slow-mo.</i>

03:02.996 --> 03:04.523
<i>Unfortunately,
Turk knows this,</i>

03:04.612 --> 03:06.821
<i>so I have to snap out of
it before he messes with me.</i>

03:07.614 --> 03:08.216
Heya!

03:08.257 --> 03:09.391
Too slow.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.058
Dude, I almost had you.

03:11.181 --> 03:12.931
A score one for J-Dism.

03:14.046 --> 03:15.303
Hot dog pin!

03:15.495 --> 03:16.944
Count it, hockey-face.

03:17.162 --> 03:20.143
Listen, you shouldn't be wasting
your calories on hot dogs, anyways.

03:20.223 --> 03:22.520
For God's sakes, Steak Night
is five minutes away.

03:22.608 --> 03:23.369
Hey.

03:24.299 --> 03:25.144
Shall we sing?

03:26.117 --> 03:27.672
<i>The Steak Night song
was to be sung</i>

03:27.823 --> 03:30.070
<i>every Steak Night that had
been for the last decade.</i>

03:30.805 --> 03:31.666
All clear!

03:31.707 --> 03:33.169
<i>The dance was new.</i>

03:33.418 --> 03:35.482
- We're going to Steak Night!
- We're going to Steak Night!

03:35.523 --> 03:37.546
- We're going to eat it right.
- We're going to eat it right.

03:37.805 --> 03:39.550
- Steak is such a treat.
- Steak is such a treat.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.407
- It is the world's best meat.
- It is the world's best meat.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.860
- We're going to Steak Night!
- We're going to Steak Night!

03:45.011 --> 03:46.664
- We're going to eat it right.
- We're going to eat it right.

03:46.719 --> 03:47.676
Excuse me, doctors!

03:47.730 --> 03:49.947
- What is your problem, lady?
- What the heck, yo? Listen to me.

03:50.002 --> 03:51.778
- We like to do a thing.
- You don't interrupt people--

03:51.888 --> 03:53.524
All right, calm down, calm down.

03:53.664 --> 03:55.721
We'll finish in the
bathroom at the restaurant.

03:55.783 --> 03:58.475
I'm so sorry,
could one of you change the IV in 103?

04:06.251 --> 04:08.711
Nothing like the
taste of fresh bag.

04:09.053 --> 04:10.898
I just picked it this morning.

04:11.089 --> 04:13.099
The only thing that
would make it any better

04:13.481 --> 04:17.773
is if it was being hooked up by that...
foxy, little dish over there.

Damn, my psychée.

04:32.396 --> 04:33.995
So, Mr. Valentine.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.867
Call me George.

04:36.059 --> 04:37.904
George.
What are you in for?

04:38.997 --> 04:41.826
<i>We think of hospitals as places
where people go to heal.</i>

04:41.988 --> 04:44.380
<i>But there are also places
where people go to die.</i>

04:44.462 --> 04:47.182
<i>And George was definitely going soon.</i>

04:47.277 --> 04:49.368
Ischemic bowel disease.

04:49.573 --> 04:50.544
I'm so sorry.

04:50.752 --> 04:53.814
Oh hey,
I've lived 70 plus years.

04:53.882 --> 04:56.205
I've had a great old
time while I was here.

04:56.424 --> 04:57.845
<i>He's over 70?</i>

04:58.474 --> 05:00.620
<i>Black people have the greatest skin.</i>

05:00.661 --> 05:01.372
No.

05:01.466 --> 05:02.368
But honestly,

05:02.491 --> 05:05.306
I don't know why people
are so afraid of dying.

05:05.771 --> 05:06.564
Tell me about it.

05:06.714 --> 05:09.598
When you're around death as much as
we are, you kinda lose your fear of it.

05:09.662 --> 05:11.364
It's one of the
benefits of working here.

05:11.473 --> 05:12.075
Yeah.

05:12.731 --> 05:14.017
Look, we're on our
way out to dinner,

05:14.126 --> 05:15.743
but is there anything we
can get you before we go?

05:16.503 --> 05:17.848
I'd kill for a cigar.

05:17.979 --> 05:20.679
You know, I'm dying and I'm
not allowed to have a cigar?

05:20.730 --> 05:22.192
What are the nurses
thinks gonna happen?

05:22.438 --> 05:23.270
They're probably thinking

05:23.271 --> 05:25.239
you could accidentally
ignite that oxygen tank

05:25.294 --> 05:28.095
and it would blow up the whole ICU,
pretty much killing everybody here.

05:28.407 --> 05:29.009
Boom!

05:29.797 --> 05:30.850
How about a beer?

05:32.745 --> 05:35.497
Listen to him,
who behaves that way at a mini-Martin (sp?)?

05:35.606 --> 05:37.930
I'm sorry Turk, but when I put
that single beer down in the counter

05:37.971 --> 05:41.710
and the 18-year old check-out
kid is like, 'Oh, big night!'

05:41.776 --> 05:43.396
It just pissed me off!
You know, I mean...

05:43.462 --> 05:44.796
Who was he to judge us?

05:44.982 --> 05:47.901
He needs to know we're not two
lame-o's with nothing going on.

05:49.110 --> 05:50.641
So that's why you bought
that box of condoms

05:50.707 --> 05:52.128
- and a flare gun.
- Exactly.

05:52.172 --> 05:53.353
Now whenever he thinks of us,

05:53.399 --> 05:56.220
he'll picture us putting a beer,
sexing up the ladies

05:56.329 --> 05:59.303
and shooting off flares,
you know, like men do.

06:00.145 --> 06:01.471
That does sound pretty awesome.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.254
I knew you'd come around!

06:04.431 --> 06:06.610
- We did it that. We did it that.
- Pow, pow!

06:07.704 --> 06:08.655
Incoming!

06:10.511 --> 06:11.725
Hey, guys,

06:12.217 --> 06:13.441
I assume you've already met

06:13.529 --> 06:16.656
my sharp, young lawyer who
is gonna help me with my will.

06:16.798 --> 06:18.799
You said I could help you!

06:19.111 --> 06:21.319
All this work for nothing!

06:22.545 --> 06:23.717
Ted! Ted!

06:24.272 --> 06:25.683
He means you.

06:26.639 --> 06:28.760
Oh, man!

06:29.015 --> 06:31.719
I did this all in my typewriter.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.463
I'll be back in 11 hours.

06:43.478 --> 06:44.703
Oh God, that tastes good!

06:46.082 --> 06:47.239
You guys gonna join me, right?

06:47.391 --> 06:50.018
Nah, they are kinda frank (sp?) on
doctors drinking beer here.

06:50.128 --> 06:51.669
And plus, I'm allergic to barley.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.911
Wait, I've seen you
drink beer before.

06:54.126 --> 06:55.482
And every time I did,

06:55.483 --> 06:56.882
I had to have an
antihistamine first.

06:56.969 --> 06:57.811
I don't remember that.

06:57.953 --> 06:59.725
Fine, Turk,
I'll tell George the truth.

07:00.446 --> 07:02.447
Even though I'm a man,
I don't like beer.

07:02.501 --> 07:04.939
I prefer Appletinis,
they make me feel fancy.

07:05.336 --> 07:08.091
There. You hurt,
and embarrassed me. Are you happy?

07:08.224 --> 07:09.065
A little bit.

07:09.229 --> 07:09.885
Guys,

07:10.585 --> 07:12.313
don't you have a dinner to go to?

07:12.521 --> 07:14.314
George, don't worry,
there's no rush.

07:14.489 --> 07:16.686
No, no,
don't you stick around on my account.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.436
Come on now,
I've got family coming pretty soon.

07:20.223 --> 07:21.054
I'm fine.

07:21.754 --> 07:23.604
<i>And then I said the only
thing I could think of</i>

07:23.626 --> 07:25.692
<i>to a man who
might not be here tomorrow.</i>

07:27.311 --> 07:28.929
It was nice to meet you,
George.

07:29.355 --> 07:30.230
Yes, it was.

07:31.636 --> 07:32.281
You too.

07:34.419 --> 07:36.362
- We're going to Steak Night.
- We're going to Steak Night.

07:36.492 --> 07:38.389
- We're gonna eat it right.
- We're gonna eat it right.

07:38.396 --> 07:39.839
Ted, 3-part harmony!

07:40.646 --> 07:44.685
Steak is such a treat,
it is the world's best meat.

07:44.805 --> 07:45.776
Big finish!

07:45.896 --> 07:47.247
Steak Night!

07:49.840 --> 07:52.284
Hot dang, just like a choir!

07:52.404 --> 07:54.025
Hey, are you working
on George's will?

07:54.145 --> 07:56.054
Can you make two copies?
We need one for his family.

07:56.054 --> 07:56.918
They're headed down here.

07:56.988 --> 07:57.671
Family?

07:58.133 --> 08:02.463
He-He's leaving all his stuff to charity,
he doesn't have any family.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.600
Not G! Aww!

08:06.875 --> 08:09.297
- Why would George lie?
- I have no idea.

08:10.134 --> 08:11.777
So, he's all alone.

08:13.809 --> 08:15.365
What do you wanna do?

08:16.417 --> 08:19.469
We're going to Steak Night,
and dammit, we're gonna eat it right.

08:20.862 --> 08:23.962
Not preferred if you put
your hand right there, buddy.

08:24.082 --> 08:25.604
Yeah, but he likes to be here.

08:28.907 --> 08:31.009
<i>I know it seems callous to leave,</i>

08:31.129 --> 08:32.645
<i>but whoever takes
care of George tonight</i>

08:32.743 --> 08:34.746
<i>will be just as compassionate as us.</i>

08:36.136 --> 08:38.474
Mr. Valentine,
I'm Dr. Mahoney.

08:38.967 --> 08:41.113
My attending really wants me
to connect with my patients

08:41.303 --> 08:45.158
so if it's okay with you, I'd thought I'd
get the ball rolling in a personal story.

08:45.644 --> 08:47.544
Okay, you can call me George.

08:47.664 --> 08:49.487
Awesome, I'm feeling it.

08:49.816 --> 08:52.411
So George, last Friday,
I'm at a bar,

08:52.751 --> 08:55.642
I take this guy home.
He's a little fat, whatever, right?

08:55.762 --> 08:58.594
Plus, chubsters are so grateful,
they usually try harder.

08:58.888 --> 09:00.271
Anyway,
right in the middle of things,

09:00.271 --> 09:02.519
he's sweating and snorting
like a hairy rhino.

09:02.630 --> 09:06.825
And I just start to hate myself,
like really, really hate myself.

09:07.554 --> 09:09.961
So without even thinking,
I just headbutt him,

09:10.081 --> 09:13.512
right in the face, bam, clock him in
between the eyes and knock him out cold.

09:14.055 --> 09:16.184
So...
That's what I got.

09:16.204 --> 09:17.394
What do you got going on?

09:18.807 --> 09:19.975
I like golf.

09:20.095 --> 09:22.903
<i>When you get down to it,
taking care of a patient</i>

09:23.023 --> 09:24.447
<i>means more than anything.</i>

09:24.567 --> 09:25.651
<i>Even Steak Night.</i>

09:25.902 --> 09:28.221
- Hey, George.
- We'll take it from here, chuckles.

09:28.352 --> 09:29.938
- Yeah.
- So long.

09:30.019 --> 09:32.285
I think I just saw the Devil.

09:37.902 --> 09:39.780
So, what happened to dinner?

09:39.900 --> 09:42.105
<i>We don't want George to
feel like he was a burden,</i>

09:42.225 --> 09:44.050
<i>so we had to come up
with a great excuse.</i>

09:44.183 --> 09:46.625
Giant oak tree
fell on the restaurant.

09:47.482 --> 09:48.733
What restaurant?

09:48.910 --> 09:50.222
Steak Cookers.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.040
- Maestros.
- Maestros.

09:52.636 --> 09:55.283
Oh man, I used to eat
there all the time.

09:55.516 --> 09:58.043
<i>Turk's upset because he thinks
when George gets outta here</i>

09:58.163 --> 10:00.330
<i>he'll drive to Maestros
and see that we lied.</i>

10:00.450 --> 10:03.168
<i>Now he's relieved because he
remembered that George is about to die</i>

10:03.301 --> 10:04.263
<i>and he's never leaving here.</i>

10:05.020 --> 10:06.897
<i>And now he feels guilty
for thinking that thought</i>

10:06.996 --> 10:08.674
<i>and he wants to punish
himself physically</i>

10:08.774 --> 10:11.360
<i>but he can't because
we're with a patient.</i>

10:11.903 --> 10:13.042
Dude, what the hell?

10:13.162 --> 10:15.779
- You wanted me to do that. You know it.
- Okay, fine. Thank you.

10:16.166 --> 10:19.062
So, George, why did you lie about
your family coming to visit you?

10:19.182 --> 10:22.142
Uh, I'm a grown man and I don't
need anybody to hold my hand.

10:23.245 --> 10:25.605
Besides, you guys have
better things to do.

10:27.132 --> 10:28.881
Hell, you don't even know me.

10:29.518 --> 10:31.880
<i>But right then, we did know George.</i>

10:32.326 --> 10:35.954
<i>He was a proud guy who didn't want
us to see how scared he really was.</i>

10:36.074 --> 10:37.876
<i>We knew what we had to do.</i>

10:37.996 --> 10:40.437
<i>We were gonna get him
past his fear of dying.</i>

10:41.010 --> 10:42.748
<i>Step one:
Get to know him.</i>

10:43.637 --> 10:45.022
So, no family, huh?

10:45.422 --> 10:47.795
My wife died. Years ago.

10:48.099 --> 10:49.179
Any kids?

10:49.428 --> 10:50.137
Nope.

10:50.257 --> 10:51.933
<i>It was like pulling teeth!</i>

10:52.053 --> 10:53.815
And what did you guys
do for a living?

10:53.935 --> 10:56.488
Barbara taught history.
I coached football.

10:56.608 --> 10:58.996
I played football.
Head defense, safety.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.262
You?

11:01.810 --> 11:05.590
Oh no, I-I didn't, uh,
I didn't play sports, per say.

11:06.085 --> 11:09.112
George, I was the, uh, mascot
for the girls' volleyball team.

11:09.358 --> 11:10.286
Really?

11:11.008 --> 11:12.476
Wear a costume?

11:12.596 --> 11:15.517
Oh, great costume,
I wore a bandana and a half-shirt.

11:16.010 --> 11:17.982
At away games,
I wear Spurs,

11:18.879 --> 11:22.369
which, in retrospective, is sort of weird
'cause we weren't the Cowboys.

11:22.863 --> 11:24.577
You must have looked
very beautiful.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.494
I felt beautiful.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.671
Guys, quick word?

11:30.545 --> 11:34.443
Look, if you wanna hang out with
patients after your shifts are over,

11:34.563 --> 11:36.240
you have to change
into your streets.

11:36.510 --> 11:37.888
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.593
Can we go?
Cougars only drink free till 9.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.036
- What about MILF's?
- Oh, I forgot I had kids.

11:46.106 --> 11:49.382
<i>Step two:
Just keep babbling until he finally opens up.</i>

11:49.502 --> 11:50.763
I don't know how
I wanna go,

11:50.865 --> 11:53.004
but I do know what I
want down with my remains.

11:54.598 --> 11:57.041
Are you really comfortable
watching TV like this?

11:58.427 --> 11:59.516
Is it Rowdy?

12:00.251 --> 12:00.932
No.

12:01.848 --> 12:02.737
Is it JD?

12:04.149 --> 12:04.936
Yes!

12:05.296 --> 12:06.670
You'll get used to it.

12:07.416 --> 12:08.543
Pretzel?

12:12.673 --> 12:15.127
You gotta stop bringing
him into our bedroom.

12:15.405 --> 12:18.229
- I'll teach you how to do my hair.
- I already know how to do your hair.

12:18.349 --> 12:20.730
It's not an Afro, Turk,
you can't just pick it.

12:20.850 --> 12:21.834
Oh, man.

12:22.096 --> 12:23.963
Did you just
make a noise, George?

12:24.374 --> 12:25.525
Come on, George.

12:26.077 --> 12:27.039
Talk to us.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.732
I'll tell you one thing.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.599
I sure didn't think
I'd go like this.

12:36.771 --> 12:37.915
<i>Now that George was talking,</i>

12:38.036 --> 12:40.233
<i>he went to a question
everyone goes to first.</i>

12:40.312 --> 12:41.024
So...

12:41.634 --> 12:44.181
Tell me, do you think there's
anything after this life?

12:44.404 --> 12:45.398
Definitely.

12:46.905 --> 12:49.394
He already has a first
day in heaven planned out.

12:49.514 --> 12:51.432
It starts with a dip
in the milkshake pool,

12:51.552 --> 12:53.218
then we'll work our
way over to the cloud

12:53.338 --> 12:55.988
where beautiful women spend
quality time with one another.

12:56.387 --> 12:58.407
You know, in a special way.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.761
Like, a lesbian cloud?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.274
Not like a lesbian cloud, George.

13:03.662 --> 13:06.198
An actual cloud, full of lesbians.

13:07.293 --> 13:10.573
I just hope I die before my wife
so I can have some fun up there.

13:10.693 --> 13:14.372
<i>Oh, when Carla dies,
heaven is going to suck!</i>

13:14.878 --> 13:16.662
That's all very nice.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.011
But we can't know for sure.

13:19.483 --> 13:21.122
I know for sure.

13:21.242 --> 13:22.811
I'm a man of faith, George.

13:23.190 --> 13:25.716
I've seen people come back
from the brink of death.

13:25.836 --> 13:28.241
And you'd be surprised how
many of them say the same thing.

13:29.236 --> 13:32.992
"I saw a white light," and we're
overcome with the feeling of peace.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.383
That's what comfort to me.

13:41.515 --> 13:43.188
Hey, Mr. Valentine!

13:43.866 --> 13:46.866
I re-did your will on a computer

13:46.986 --> 13:50.670
and to make it less depressing,
I used a fun font.

13:50.928 --> 13:52.866
Really, Ted, fun font?

13:54.192 --> 13:56.576
I like seeing my name in Squiglees.

13:56.905 --> 13:58.578
Oh yeah, that's the font!

13:59.212 --> 14:00.527
Recognise!

14:01.683 --> 14:04.548
- What's happening?
- It's this new thing Ed came up with.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.452
When you disrespect someone,
and they, in turn, burn your ass

14:08.572 --> 14:10.155
you must... recognise!

14:11.044 --> 14:13.169
Fine, Ted, I recognise.

14:13.289 --> 14:14.531
Hell, yeah!

14:14.651 --> 14:15.752
Hell, yeah!

14:16.175 --> 14:17.954
- I hate Ed.
- I know.

14:18.460 --> 14:19.728
Hard to believe.

14:20.515 --> 14:23.380
My whole life goes down
to these four pages.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.748
I wondered if
anybody would remember me?

14:29.777 --> 14:30.794
Come on, George.

14:31.596 --> 14:32.706
When my dad died,

14:32.759 --> 14:35.407
I thought my brother and I were
gonna be the only two to remember him.

14:36.446 --> 14:37.689
I was totally wrong.

14:39.762 --> 14:41.366
When we were, uh, growing up,

14:41.460 --> 14:44.522
there was this one
homeless guy in our town.

14:44.762 --> 14:48.386
We used to call him
Mr. Long-Beard Stinky Pants.

14:49.081 --> 14:52.959
Uh, because he had this
really long beard and, uh, his pants--

14:53.088 --> 14:53.689
He gets it.

14:54.919 --> 14:56.067
...they were stinky.

14:56.452 --> 14:58.571
Anyway, every time
we went out to dinner,

14:58.626 --> 15:01.455
my father would make us
give him our left-overs.

15:01.591 --> 15:03.696
My mom hated that.
She used to be like,

15:04.530 --> 15:07.181
"He's just gonna use those
pork-chops for drugs."

15:09.137 --> 15:10.695
My mom drank a lot.

15:11.706 --> 15:14.098
The point is,
a couple months ago,

15:14.467 --> 15:18.602
I-I went home and there's this clean,
shaving guy working in the pizzeria.

15:18.713 --> 15:20.933
He takes me aside,
and says,

15:22.027 --> 15:24.658
"Your father was a great man."

15:26.349 --> 15:28.878
It was Mr. Long-Beard Stinky Pants.

15:30.466 --> 15:32.075
Although now,
he prefers Kevin.

15:34.928 --> 15:36.158
Anyway, George, I...

15:36.979 --> 15:38.038
I promise you...

15:38.602 --> 15:40.549
People are gonna
remember you the same way.

15:41.796 --> 15:43.163
Thank you very much.

15:46.274 --> 15:47.897
Wow, it's kind of emotional in here.

15:48.324 --> 15:49.428
You guys keep this up eventually,

15:49.508 --> 15:51.797
you'll all get your periods on
the same day, which is kinda cool.

15:52.082 --> 15:53.586
Denise, a quick word.

15:55.195 --> 15:58.851
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and
ban you from Mr. Valentine's room.

15:59.108 --> 15:59.825
Whatever.

15:59.945 --> 16:00.955
All the patients are stable,

16:01.055 --> 16:03.114
so I'm just gonna go catch
some Z's in the on-call room.

16:03.259 --> 16:04.301
Who's the chubster?

16:06.403 --> 16:07.154
I don't know.

16:13.801 --> 16:16.330
Meet me in the on-call room,
pants down, lights off.

16:16.791 --> 16:19.422
I just wanted to say,
"I am so psyched that you called me back--"

16:19.423 --> 16:20.891
No, no, no talking.

16:21.009 --> 16:23.931
And if you touch me too much,
God help me, I will headbutt you again.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.493
I love you.

16:29.107 --> 16:32.968
<i>And finally, George only had
one fear left to tackle.</i>

16:33.327 --> 16:34.267
At the end...

16:36.702 --> 16:37.966
Is it gonna hurt?

16:38.428 --> 16:40.375
No, you won't imagine
the pain you'll have. (sp?)

16:41.229 --> 16:42.613
But how is it gonna happen exactly?

16:43.397 --> 16:44.121
Maybe if I knew

16:44.203 --> 16:46.254
what was coming,
I'd be able to handle it better.

16:46.971 --> 16:47.983
Well, uh...

16:48.406 --> 16:51.359
Eventually, it will become
harder for you to breathe.

16:53.299 --> 16:55.814
But you won't be gasping for air;
you'll just...

16:57.044 --> 16:58.165
Feel more drowsy.

17:00.576 --> 17:02.817
And as the rest of your organs,

17:03.036 --> 17:04.184
begin to fail,

17:06.316 --> 17:07.655
you'll just, sort-of,

17:09.060 --> 17:09.866
go.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.571
I'll just go?

17:16.358 --> 17:17.097
I like that.

17:19.256 --> 17:20.267
<i>And there it was, </i>

17:20.964 --> 17:24.012
<i>The fear was gone and all
the remain was acceptance.</i>

17:30.657 --> 17:31.587
No.

17:33.543 --> 17:35.639
No, I know what you
guys are trying to do,

17:35.759 --> 17:37.415
I just can't get over the
fact that one minute I'm here

17:37.506 --> 17:39.242
and the next, I'm not?

17:40.803 --> 17:43.537
<i>And that's when Turk and I
told George how we really felt.</i>

17:43.947 --> 17:45.860
George, I'm terrified of dying.

17:46.147 --> 17:46.735
Me too.

17:47.259 --> 17:48.949
But, why'd you lie?

17:49.512 --> 17:51.535
We fight death for a living,
every single day,

17:51.562 --> 17:54.009
we can't let it know we're afraid
of it or it will kick our ass.

17:55.676 --> 17:57.111
There we are.

17:58.902 --> 18:00.268
Everybody's scared.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.159
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

18:04.239 --> 18:06.658
Oh, well then what in the
hell do I have to hope for?

18:08.558 --> 18:10.007
Well if it were me,

18:11.175 --> 18:13.712
I would just hope that my
last thought was a good one.

18:16.607 --> 18:17.696
Well then, that's it?

18:18.497 --> 18:18.976
That's it.

18:19.495 --> 18:21.053
You thought that was deep?
That was...

18:23.008 --> 18:24.087
That wasn't deep.

18:26.219 --> 18:27.012
Sorry.

18:27.135 --> 18:28.215
I'm over here dying.

18:28.372 --> 18:30.682
That's all,
that's all you can come up with?

18:35.260 --> 18:37.625
<i>Turk and I spent the next
few hours in that room.</i>

18:38.062 --> 18:39.033
<i>Just talking...</i>

18:39.183 --> 18:40.564
<i>Hanging with George.</i>

18:40.700 --> 18:42.491
When Turk and I were in college,

18:43.147 --> 18:44.978
we were roommates.

18:45.831 --> 18:52.709
[ Song: I Will Follow You Into the Dark
Artist: Death Cab For Cutie ]

19:16.645 --> 19:17.574
Hey...

19:18.203 --> 19:19.064
Guys.

19:21.612 --> 19:23.239
I'm getting a little tired.

19:24.190 --> 19:25.597
Okay, well,

19:26.212 --> 19:27.128
take a quick nap.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.928
You guys are gonna be
here when I wake up?

19:31.994 --> 19:32.691
Of course!

19:35.646 --> 19:36.889
Hey, man...

19:39.869 --> 19:41.277
That beer,

19:42.179 --> 19:43.409
tasted great!

19:47.458 --> 19:48.935
<i>George never did wake up.</i>

19:49.796 --> 19:52.406
<i>And even all that talking
didn't make death any easier.</i>

19:53.062 --> 19:54.114
<i>At least, not for us.</i>

19:55.717 --> 19:58.519
<i>Maybe in the end,
all you can really hope for...</i>

19:59.298 --> 20:01.717
<i>is that your last thought is a nice one.</i>

20:12.634 --> 20:14.562
<i>Even if it's just about the taste</i>

20:14.862 --> 20:17.022
<i>of an ice, cold beer.</i>

20:19.939 --> 20:21.306
George was right.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.713
This beer is good.

20:23.615 --> 20:26.007
I wouldn't know,
I don't really like beer.

20:27.668 --> 20:28.797
Goodbye, George.

20:42.089 --> 20:42.554
<i>Action!</i>

20:42.718 --> 20:45.068
I have the same nightmare, every time.

20:45.806 --> 20:48.417
That I'd die and leave my
family and friends behind.

20:49.773 --> 20:51.290
I'm diabetic, so...

20:51.891 --> 20:53.627
I'm probably gonna go before him.

20:53.805 --> 20:54.611
Hopefully.

20:54.843 --> 20:55.499
Dude!

20:55.614 --> 20:56.921
I'm gonna have you stuffed.

20:57.126 --> 20:58.274
Carla already said, "No."

20:58.506 --> 20:59.586
I must stuff her too.

21:00.152 --> 21:00.767
You promise?

21:00.835 --> 21:02.065
I'm gonna keep her
in the closet, though.

21:02.298 --> 21:03.227
Alright, but don't tell her.

21:03.323 --> 21:04.430
She don't need to know nothing.

21:05.592 --> 21:06.822
But you're in next to each other.
