WEBVTT

00:12.013 --> 00:16.267
Be honest. You miss him.

00:19.646 --> 00:21.690
Every day.

00:22.691 --> 00:29.698
And so you came up with this idea.
The frozen man.

00:30.490 --> 00:34.953
He doesn't age.
He doesn't change.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.665
You don't like change.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.169
I'm okay with change.

00:43.336 --> 00:47.799
Hon, please.

00:48.717 --> 00:50.719
You told me about your house.

00:51.678 --> 00:54.764
You still have his voice
on the answering machine.

00:54.931 --> 00:57.308
His clothes in the closet.

00:58.435 --> 01:03.273
- Can't I miss my husband?
- Dr. Bird, don't bullshit me.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.651
You've been in my seat.

01:06.818 --> 01:11.781
If I were sitting here right now telling you
how my husband died 20 years ago...

01:11.948 --> 01:14.451
...and I haven't touched a thing,
and not only...

01:14.617 --> 01:18.747
...but I keep this fantasy alive
that he isn't dead.

01:18.913 --> 01:25.920
He's actually frozen
in some kind of cryogenic chamber.

01:28.173 --> 01:30.550
He's coming back.

01:32.844 --> 01:34.804
But you see it, right?

01:35.722 --> 01:38.183
How you're the one who's frozen?

01:41.644 --> 01:43.980
Tell me about your mother.

01:49.903 --> 01:55.992
She died loading the dishwasher.
January 2nd.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.995
A Thursday. I was 5.

01:59.162 --> 02:02.707
We were in the yellow house
on Potsdamer Platz.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.880
This was when Pops
was stationed in Germany.

02:09.047 --> 02:14.552
I'm in half pants and a dinosaur shirt
playing with Silly Putty on the floor.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.596
You could press it
into the newspaper...

02:16.763 --> 02:18.640
...make a copy of Marmaduke, etcetera.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.434
- Hmm.
- Heh, heh.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.354
9:15 in the morning.

02:24.521 --> 02:29.734
It was raining
and it stopped and the sun came out.

02:29.901 --> 02:34.948
And I'm pressing the Silly Putty
to this paper on the floor.

02:35.114 --> 02:40.787
This black and white linoleum
in, like, a chevron pattern.

02:40.954 --> 02:46.751
And the kitchen is warm from the steam
when you open the dishwasher.

02:46.918 --> 02:52.590
And she finished the plates
and took out the cutlery basket.

02:53.967 --> 02:57.887
Did you know they called it that?
A cutlery basket?

02:58.054 --> 02:59.097
No.

02:59.264 --> 03:00.849
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hmm.

03:01.015 --> 03:08.022
She's unloading the dinner dishes,
singing along with the radio.

03:08.231 --> 03:13.194
"99 Luftballoons."
She had a nice voice.

03:14.112 --> 03:17.407
You spend a lot of time in this memory.

03:19.951 --> 03:21.578
In the past.

03:22.495 --> 03:25.290
I like to think I'm a time traveler.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.919
I go back, back, back.

03:32.130 --> 03:36.384
But all I can do is watch.

03:38.928 --> 03:44.767
You see how unhealthy that is,
this attachment between you.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.895
Oh.... Uh...

03:47.061 --> 03:49.564
I know why you'd think that,
but we're really--

03:49.731 --> 03:52.567
- The same person. Basically.
- Yeah, basically.

03:52.734 --> 03:58.197
- The way we move and how we....
- Finish each other's sentences almost.

03:58.364 --> 04:04.537
Not that we're-- I mean, I know we're not
literally the same, like, sharing a body or--

04:04.704 --> 04:06.289
That'd be--

04:06.456 --> 04:10.001
We're not crazy, we just really....

04:10.168 --> 04:15.340
- Really like being together.
- Or not "like," but, um....

04:15.506 --> 04:18.384
What's it--? Who's it hurting?
That's my....

04:18.551 --> 04:20.720
- That's what I wanna know.
- Mm.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.973
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.

04:30.772 --> 04:36.319
Didn't you tell me how you were
the last boy in your class to mature?

04:36.486 --> 04:42.116
Your voice dropping,
the hair coming in, down there?

04:42.283 --> 04:46.329
It's not a race.
What a boy goes through.

04:47.455 --> 04:51.209
His physical and emotional growth.

04:52.335 --> 04:57.131
What matters is where you end up.

04:57.966 --> 05:03.096
Do I seem like
less than a man to you now? Hmm?

05:05.431 --> 05:11.813
I'm just trying to help you see the truth.
This constant anger.

05:11.980 --> 05:15.942
You feel isolated by the world,
but it's not the world isolating you.

05:16.109 --> 05:17.402
It's you.

05:18.945 --> 05:25.118
Look, I know you're just trying to help.

05:25.284 --> 05:28.454
But it just doesn't, for some reason,
feel real.

05:30.206 --> 05:32.375
Talk about that.

05:33.710 --> 05:36.212
I don't know. There's...

05:37.463 --> 05:39.632
Something's wrong.

05:43.428 --> 05:48.975
Like a dream, you know?
But not an interesting one.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.895
More like the one
where you're folding laundry.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.314
Or eating.

05:55.481 --> 06:01.195
Everything seems normal,
but somehow you know.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.492
Okay.

06:06.659 --> 06:12.540
Well, the old clock on the wall says
it's time for your meds...

06:12.707 --> 06:16.044
...so let's pick this up tomorrow.

06:17.295 --> 06:18.921
Okay?

07:15.144 --> 07:19.982
<i>Sydney Barrett
to nurse's station. This is warning number one.</i>

07:26.322 --> 07:28.533
- Yeah. I like it.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.243
- Ooh.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.245
- Heh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:44.757 --> 07:47.927
Twenty-nine, you have....

07:49.679 --> 07:52.890
Spot check. Arms out.

07:53.057 --> 07:54.392
Do we...?

07:55.476 --> 07:57.145
I just....

07:57.311 --> 08:01.023
You know I can't stand to be touched.
There's a note in....

08:23.296 --> 08:28.384
It's just spit, right? Human spit?

08:30.011 --> 08:33.848
Maybe he ate yogurt.
Like a creamy or...?

08:34.015 --> 08:35.850
What's he on? Klonopin?

08:36.017 --> 08:39.312
Yeah, Klonopin'll-- Or....

08:39.478 --> 08:44.275
Hold the phone, yogurt and Klonopin.

08:44.442 --> 08:48.279
That old cocktail.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.825
Do you ever wonder
what he was like before this place?

08:53.784 --> 08:58.789
Like, did he have a bank account
or a girlfriend?

08:58.956 --> 09:04.045
- Maybe he loved dogs.
- Everybody loves dogs.

09:04.212 --> 09:06.297
Not me.

09:06.464 --> 09:13.429
- I'm saying, who was he before this?
- Who were you?

09:13.596 --> 09:18.726
Who was I? There is no before.

09:18.893 --> 09:21.896
Not once the sickness starts.

09:22.063 --> 09:25.107
That's the lie, the cruelest joke.

09:25.274 --> 09:29.445
How somehow, with the right dosage,
the right therapy...

09:29.612 --> 09:36.619
...stand on one leg, touch your nose,
we could all go back to, what?

09:36.869 --> 09:38.913
Loving dogs?

09:43.334 --> 09:46.629
Twenty bucks it breaks before
it hits the floor.

09:46.796 --> 09:51.550
- It never breaks.
- Never say never.

09:51.717 --> 09:52.760
Hi.

09:54.470 --> 09:58.057
- There's pie at lunch.
- I got an inside track.

09:58.224 --> 10:04.272
- Fish fingers, broccoli florets and pie. Heh.
- Cherry.

10:04.438 --> 10:08.776
Paul knows this guy in the cafeteria.

10:09.902 --> 10:14.490
That so? I know you love that.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.620
Hey, did you guys notice there's
a different door in the south hall?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.665
Different how?

10:22.832 --> 10:26.252
- It's like a bedroom door, like from a--
- David.

10:26.419 --> 10:28.879
- Hey. It's time for your session.
- Um....

10:38.139 --> 10:41.267
So, how are you feeling?

10:41.434 --> 10:46.272
Good, you know.
I've been much clearer actually.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.985
<i>I really feel like I've found myself here.</i>

10:57.199 --> 11:01.746
<i>A rhythm, a sense of peace.</i>

11:03.456 --> 11:06.292
<i>I'm reading a lot, painting.</i>

11:07.376 --> 11:10.129
<i>And with Syd, how close we've gotten.</i>

11:10.921 --> 11:14.508
<i>- The world is starting to make sense.
- Hmm.</i>

11:15.676 --> 11:17.345
Good.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.431
And these issues you used to raise...

11:20.598 --> 11:26.395
...feelings of separation,
of difference from the rest of the world?

11:26.562 --> 11:32.651
Well, I have somebody now, you know?
A relationship and that-- I don't know.

11:32.818 --> 11:38.199
I just feel in control here.
Like, my expectations.

11:38.366 --> 11:40.910
Like I'm not trying to bite off
more than I can chew.

11:41.077 --> 11:44.205
But at the same time,
I have so much more than--

11:44.372 --> 11:46.415
Do you ever worry you'll lose it?

11:48.834 --> 11:52.922
I used to, all the time.

11:53.089 --> 12:00.054
I think about the mirage,
how this feeling, clarity...

12:00.596 --> 12:02.598
...how maybe that's just...

12:02.765 --> 12:06.018
...you know, a symptom of the other
side of the disease kicking in.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.937
- You're talking about mania.
- Yes.

12:08.104 --> 12:12.608
Because people always talk
about the depression side...

12:12.775 --> 12:19.657
...but it's the other side,
that invulnerable feeling...

12:19.824 --> 12:24.662
...that's dangerous.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.501
I just don't wanna mess things up,
you know?

12:31.585 --> 12:33.504
Now that I have balance.

13:09.957 --> 13:13.252
Stop. No pie for you.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.671
What? Why?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.009
Mm.

13:20.176 --> 13:23.471
- Here. Take mine.
- No.

13:35.274 --> 13:36.650
Eat.

13:38.027 --> 13:44.283
- No. Not if you can't have any.
- Go ahead. It's just pie.

13:58.964 --> 14:03.677
- There's bugs. Bugs, bugs.
- You okay?

14:09.475 --> 14:14.313
<i>Sun in the sky
You know how I feel</i>

14:15.356 --> 14:20.402
<i>Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel</i>

14:21.612 --> 14:23.239
<i>It's a new dawn</i>

14:23.405 --> 14:25.991
<i>It's a new day</i>

14:26.367 --> 14:29.161
<i>It's a new life for me, yeah</i>

14:29.328 --> 14:31.664
<i>It's a new dawn
It's a new day</i>

14:31.830 --> 14:35.000
<i>It's a new life for me</i>

14:38.712 --> 14:42.299
<i>And I'm feeling good</i>

14:53.435 --> 14:58.524
<i>Fish in the sea

14:59.400 --> 15:04.488

15:05.406 --> 15:10.035

It's a new day</i>

15:13.414 --> 15:15.708
<i>It's a new life</i>

<i>For me</i>

15:18.377 --> 15:21.589
<i>And I'm feeling good</i>

16:59.978 --> 17:01.480
Boo.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.608
Jesus.

17:05.859 --> 17:09.780
- Are you allowed to be in here?
- Don't be a baby. Move over.

17:24.878 --> 17:28.340
- What?
- Nothing.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.138
I just....

17:34.304 --> 17:39.476
You ever have that feeling
like something's happened before?

17:39.643 --> 17:41.937
Except differently.

17:43.397 --> 17:48.902
So like déjà vu, but different.

17:50.654 --> 17:54.533
Are you happy here?

17:56.285 --> 18:00.038
Look at us.
Why wouldn't I be happy?

18:00.205 --> 18:07.212
I know, but shouldn't we be trying
to get better, get out?

18:07.838 --> 18:10.966
I'm no good at out there.

18:11.133 --> 18:15.763
No. It's too much. Too loud.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.974
It's life. What life is.

18:19.141 --> 18:22.644
Well, the last time I tried "life"...

18:22.811 --> 18:25.481
...I ended up with an extension cord
around my neck so--

18:25.647 --> 18:27.775
I'm not saying....

18:30.027 --> 18:32.780
I know it's not gonna be easy
but come on...

18:32.946 --> 18:36.033
...you can't stay here forever,
popping pills five times a day.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.829
First, I am down to twice a day.

18:40.996 --> 18:45.542
And second, maybe, who knows?

18:45.709 --> 18:50.506
Maybe they'll give us our own room.
We could be together.

18:50.672 --> 18:54.927
You know?
Simple, just living day by day.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.471
Till what? Osteoporosis?

19:00.182 --> 19:03.769
You really want to grow old
in a mental hospital?

19:04.645 --> 19:08.857
- Die here, surrounded by--?
- What? The other freaks?

19:09.024 --> 19:10.984
Maybe we should.
Maybe we belong here.

19:11.151 --> 19:14.947
Lenny, Dr. Busker, she says that not
everybody is cut out for real life...

19:15.113 --> 19:18.283
...the grind of it.

19:18.450 --> 19:23.080
And me with my sensitivity.

19:24.414 --> 19:28.502
I need the routine, the grounding.
I'm good.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.799
I can't stay here.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.763
Not even for me?

19:51.149 --> 19:52.234
Abilify.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.702
Brintellix.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.132
Chlorpromazine.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.597
Duloxetine.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.724
Escitalopram.

20:23.891 --> 20:27.144
- Such a beautiful day.
- Flupentixol.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.271
That's an injectable.

20:29.438 --> 20:33.483
- You ever seen a sky so blue?
- It can also be a tablet.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.776
Mm....

20:34.943 --> 20:38.614
I'll allow it. Geodon.

20:40.616 --> 20:45.245
- We're exercising our minds.
- Yeah, I see that.

20:46.246 --> 20:50.042
- Sorry. I didn't sleep well.
- Is it the dream again?

20:52.461 --> 20:55.172
I'm in a room that's not a room...

20:57.466 --> 20:59.343
...full of people I can't see.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.057
And there's this feeling,
like we're already dead.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.434
We just don't know it.

21:09.895 --> 21:13.106
- Clozapine.
- Or Effexor in large doses.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.524
Yeah.

21:22.950 --> 21:28.246
I personally dreamed
of a very large ice cube.

21:28.413 --> 21:32.876
Which.... You know,
I could kill for, like, a lemonade.

21:33.043 --> 21:36.129
- A nice frosty....
- Mine was....

21:36.964 --> 21:38.590
Wait.

21:39.049 --> 21:43.553
Do you remember that old movie,
<i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?</i>

21:43.720 --> 21:46.390
- Melanie?
- What?

21:46.556 --> 21:49.434
- What do you dream about?
- Love.

21:51.019 --> 21:58.026
Have you guys noticed a door in the hall?
It's not always there.

21:58.235 --> 22:01.780
So where is it?
When it's not there, I mean.

22:01.947 --> 22:05.283
- Exactly.
- What?

22:05.450 --> 22:08.829
How can a door be there
and not be there at the same time?

22:08.996 --> 22:13.333
Uh.... Alternate dimensions, perhaps.

22:13.500 --> 22:18.588
Or physical displacement rooted
in four dimensional geometry.

22:18.755 --> 22:23.010
Or simpler still, the subject...

22:23.176 --> 22:26.555
...you, confusing one hallway
with another.

22:26.722 --> 22:30.475
- I'm not making it up.
- Oh, no. No one said making up.

22:30.642 --> 22:34.187
Confusing is what I said, as in the
interchangeability of the hallways...

22:34.354 --> 22:40.318
...and how one memory could
be confused with another memory.

22:40.485 --> 22:44.614
No. This is something else.

23:09.806 --> 23:14.603
Hold that thought.
I have to go to the little boy's room.

24:02.109 --> 24:05.445
- Aah! Uncle, uncle. It's me.
- Sorry.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.782
That's quite a grip you've got there. Heh.

24:17.916 --> 24:21.962
I'll be right next door, okay?
If you get scared, just knock on the wall.

24:22.129 --> 24:23.255
Affirmative.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.331
<i>Namaste.</i>

25:15.473 --> 25:17.100
Hmm.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.004
Hello.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.882
Hello.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.061
Uh....

26:44.521 --> 26:48.233
I'm.... Is this...?

26:48.400 --> 26:52.362
Am I dreaming?
I saw an ice cube.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.240
Like, a huge....

26:57.284 --> 27:01.121
Can you take me there?

27:08.003 --> 27:09.129
Oh.

27:09.296 --> 27:10.755
Yeah.

27:24.311 --> 27:25.437
Maybe.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.606
Maybe what?

27:28.773 --> 27:31.151
Well, I was thinking about that door...

27:31.318 --> 27:34.195
...and how it's there sometimes
and not other times.

27:34.362 --> 27:35.405
And how....

27:35.572 --> 27:40.410
I didn't tell you this, but I heard banging
inside, like someone wanted to get out.

27:40.577 --> 27:41.953
Except nobody else....

27:42.120 --> 27:45.206
And then I thought, you know,
I've had this feeling for weeks...

27:45.373 --> 27:48.668
...of how sometimes this place
just doesn't seem real.

27:48.835 --> 27:53.256
And in this book I'm reading about
dream states and memory palaces...

27:53.423 --> 27:57.719
...and this idea of how maybe this place,
the hospital...

27:57.886 --> 28:02.974
...maybe it's a version of reality
and not reality itself.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.937
- What?
- Just be careful.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.359
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

28:13.818 --> 28:18.698
Just with your diagnosis.
And the things you're saying.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.242
I would hate them to find out
and up your meds.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.079
What do you mean?

28:24.245 --> 28:28.124
What do imaginary doors have to do
with not wanting to be touched?

28:29.793 --> 28:34.631
- What do you mean touched?
- You know, my thing.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.425
How I don't like to be touched.
How it hurts me.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.015
Uh, well.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.643
That's not....

28:47.852 --> 28:51.940
You're in here because of, well,
the delusional thinking, right?

28:52.107 --> 28:57.779
- Seeing things that aren't real.
- No. That's you.

28:57.946 --> 29:01.950
Me? No, I'm manic depression.
Sad, happy. Sad, happy.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.369
Just more so. Remember?

29:04.536 --> 29:08.790
All the stories, awake for 72 hours straight,
the frantic alphabetizing...

29:08.957 --> 29:11.584
...and then I tied a knot.

29:11.751 --> 29:17.424
What are you talking about?
You're schizophrenic.

29:17.590 --> 29:21.344
I have an anti-social personality disorder.

29:21.511 --> 29:24.055
- Schizo--?
- I'm not....

29:24.222 --> 29:26.266
I don't have crazy thoughts.
You're the....

29:26.433 --> 29:28.685
I just don't wanna--
Why are you saying that?

29:28.852 --> 29:31.646
You're right. I'm--
I must have gotten....

29:31.813 --> 29:33.022
- David.
- Look. I'm sorry.

29:33.189 --> 29:36.359
You're much, much better.
And I shouldn't have--

29:36.526 --> 29:38.653
It's like-- Dr. Busker says it's like...

29:38.820 --> 29:41.197
...how you're not supposed
to wake a sleep walker.

29:41.364 --> 29:44.701
I wanna make sure that you're not,
because when I start to turn...

29:44.868 --> 29:49.789
...when the sad lifts and the manic comes
on, you know, at first it feels good.

29:49.956 --> 29:54.085
You know? Like I have more energy.
I feel more positive.

29:54.252 --> 29:58.548
- David, I'm not psychotic.
- No. I never said--

29:58.715 --> 30:02.302
Baby, please. You are so much
better than when you first....

30:02.469 --> 30:06.723
I mean, they had you in straps.
Remember? Raving and violent.

30:06.890 --> 30:13.021
So just, for me,
just take some deep breaths. Okay?

30:15.648 --> 30:20.195
It's just a hospital.
All the doors are hospital doors.

30:21.488 --> 30:22.530
I'm....

30:25.700 --> 30:27.994
I got to go.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.329
Syd.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.540
Syd, wait.

30:35.585 --> 30:36.878
Syd.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.419
<i>I killed your friend.</i>

31:22.006 --> 31:23.633
<i>- Wanna be my girlfriend?
- Hey, gorgeous.</i>

31:28.471 --> 31:30.181
<i>I'm the magic man.</i>

31:42.277 --> 31:44.988
- Sydney?
- Aah. Hey.

31:45.154 --> 31:48.575
What are you doing out here?
It's after hours.

31:49.450 --> 31:52.120
I'm sorry. I was just on my way
back from the bathroom.

31:52.287 --> 31:56.040
- Do you like music?
- Music?

31:56.207 --> 31:59.711
I've had a lot of luck lately
with music therapies.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.713
Patients find it very calming.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.756
Yeah, I like music. I'm just, you know.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.301
- It's bedtime and all that.
- It's okay.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.220
Go ahead.

32:10.930 --> 32:14.976
Go ahead. Put them on.

32:19.731 --> 32:21.190
Hmm.

32:30.908 --> 32:32.535
It's beautiful.

32:35.163 --> 32:36.372
What is it?

32:37.540 --> 32:41.419
- Crickets.
- Crickets?

32:41.586 --> 32:43.171
Just listen.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.060
Cary?

35:03.770 --> 35:08.065
And when spring comes,
the baby birds must leave the nest.

35:10.151 --> 35:13.529
Did you see...?
Is Cary, is he out there?

35:14.489 --> 35:17.742
What big eyes you have, says the wolf.

35:19.035 --> 35:22.705
I-- Stop. I have to find--
I have to find him.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.056
Young.

35:41.098 --> 35:44.977
- Not too young.
- Careful, I bite.

35:45.228 --> 35:48.147
Hmm. Me too.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.026
Don't.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.369
Did you ever eat an animal
that was still living?

36:03.496 --> 36:09.210
There's a smell. A heat.

36:11.629 --> 36:13.756
You're burning up.

36:17.718 --> 36:22.849
Cary! Cary! Cary! Cary!

36:24.433 --> 36:29.814
You can run, my love,
but there's just no place to go.

37:15.443 --> 37:18.863
- Nobody wants you here.
- What?

37:19.030 --> 37:21.991
I said you're unwanted.

37:25.369 --> 37:30.541
- I have friends.
- They only pretend to like you.

37:31.292 --> 37:36.297
See? You know I'm right.
Your whole life you've felt it.

37:36.464 --> 37:39.717
You're a freak.
You're disgusting.

37:39.884 --> 37:43.763
We adopt you because we have to,
but deep down...

37:43.930 --> 37:47.850
...it's all we can do to keep from puking
whenever you're around.

38:06.786 --> 38:07.870
Stop.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.420
What's that, my love?

39:00.589 --> 39:03.342
Yes, I'm here.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.722
I've waited.

39:24.739 --> 39:27.366
Yes. I understand.

39:28.701 --> 39:31.120
I'm on my way.

40:54.411 --> 40:56.789
I don't understand.

40:57.414 --> 40:59.458
Why can't you just talk to me?

42:23.667 --> 42:25.628
Hello, David.

42:27.546 --> 42:30.257
- Our session's not until the morning.
- I know. I just....

42:30.424 --> 42:33.886
- Have you seen Syd?
- Have I seen her? No.

42:34.053 --> 42:37.181
But it is a locked ward.
She shouldn't be too hard to find.

42:37.348 --> 42:40.017
- I've looked everywhere.
- Sit.

42:40.601 --> 42:42.228
Please.

42:46.398 --> 42:50.444
I'm starting to wonder
if she's really the right girl for you.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.447
What do you--? We're in love.

42:56.784 --> 43:01.455
Do you know what love is? A chemical.

43:01.622 --> 43:06.627
Electrons in your brain, sending signals.

43:07.670 --> 43:12.424
Are you familiar
with <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis?</i>

43:12.591 --> 43:17.596
It's a fungus that infects ants.
It's amazing, really.

43:17.763 --> 43:21.183
The spores take over their
central nervous systems...

43:21.350 --> 43:23.852
...and force them to climb
to a high point...

43:24.019 --> 43:27.856
...and then the fungus
begins to grow up...

43:28.023 --> 43:33.946
...bursting from the tops
of their heads like a branch.

43:34.738 --> 43:37.491
And it kills them, of course.

43:38.158 --> 43:41.287
All so it can spray new spores...

43:41.453 --> 43:44.915
...over the jungle, infecting more ants.

43:45.541 --> 43:48.669
When people say love,
that's what I think of.

43:52.339 --> 43:57.594
- A simple "I haven't seen her" was all I--
- Tell me, what is the point of all this love?

43:57.761 --> 44:03.225
All the striving, the friendships?

44:03.892 --> 44:06.562
I mean,
what is the ****ing point of babies?

44:08.480 --> 44:11.150
- You mean life?
- Yes, life.

44:11.317 --> 44:13.319
What is the point of life?

44:13.485 --> 44:17.865
All of you running around trying to what,
be happy?

44:18.032 --> 44:21.702
- Fulfilled?
- You tell me.

44:22.703 --> 44:24.496
I'll say this.

44:24.663 --> 44:30.044
There's only one being in the vast
multiplicity of space that matters.

44:30.210 --> 44:34.673
God.
And do you know why God matters?

44:36.050 --> 44:37.968
- Power.
- Aah.

44:39.303 --> 44:43.932
That is the point of what you call life.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.393
The only point.

44:47.436 --> 44:49.313
Power.

44:50.773 --> 44:53.275
Walter understands.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.796
David.

45:14.380 --> 45:16.382
I knew your father, did you know that?

45:17.424 --> 45:19.927
- My--?
- Your real father.

45:20.677 --> 45:22.763
The guy that gave you away.

45:23.639 --> 45:24.681
I know.

45:25.224 --> 45:27.601
Boo-hoo. Talk about an asshole.

45:27.768 --> 45:31.772
Always acting so holy
and then gives away his only son.

45:31.939 --> 45:32.981
Stop. Stop.

45:33.148 --> 45:37.528
He thought he could hide you from me,
but he was wrong.

45:37.694 --> 45:43.200
I found you.
Such a sweet little baby.

45:43.909 --> 45:49.456
And me, your very own walking...

45:49.623 --> 45:52.960
...talking fungus.

45:54.420 --> 45:58.132
What do you think he'll say
when he finds out?

45:58.632 --> 46:00.509
I'm trying to help you, kid. Come on.

46:00.676 --> 46:04.304
Man, you have so much potential.

46:04.471 --> 46:07.599
Much more powerful
than I ever imagined.

46:07.766 --> 46:10.269
I mean, I figured I'd just poison you
and move on...

46:10.436 --> 46:14.314
...but then I thought,
our powers together, man, that'll....

46:14.481 --> 46:16.108
A cocktail!

46:16.275 --> 46:19.486
Shit, we could give God
a run for his money, right?

46:19.653 --> 46:21.989
But then all this love bullshit.

46:22.156 --> 46:25.617
I'm beginning to think
I have to go it alone.

46:26.034 --> 46:28.370
Do you know what happens to you
in this scenario?

46:37.004 --> 46:39.256
- Doctor.
- Please, Lenny.

46:39.798 --> 46:42.176
Come on, we've known each other
since the womb.

46:43.635 --> 46:47.890
- What did you do to Syd?
- Oh, shut up.

46:48.056 --> 46:53.145
I've tried making you comfortable.
I let you have your friends, your woman.

46:54.396 --> 46:57.816
But the fact is, it's too much work.
And honestly?

46:57.983 --> 47:01.653
All I need from you is your body.
And your mind?

47:01.820 --> 47:05.491
Well, I could give a shit about your mind.

47:18.504 --> 47:20.172
Help!

47:20.756 --> 47:22.841
Help!

47:35.812 --> 47:38.607
<i>Wake up, you sleepy head</i>

47:38.774 --> 47:42.319
<i>Put on some clothes
Shake off your bed</i>

47:42.486 --> 47:46.156
<i>Put another log on the fire for me</i>

47:46.323 --> 47:49.618
<i>I've made some breakfast and coffee</i>

47:49.785 --> 47:53.330
<i>Look out my window, what do I see</i>

47:53.497 --> 47:58.627
<i>A crack in the sky
And a hand reaching down to me</i>

47:58.794 --> 48:01.713
<i>All the nightmares came today</i>

48:02.756 --> 48:07.302
<i>Looks as though
They're here to stay</i>

48:08.679 --> 48:10.973
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

48:11.139 --> 48:12.766
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

48:12.933 --> 48:15.018
<i>Don't you know you're driving</i>

48:15.185 --> 48:21.567
<i>Your mamas and papas insane?</i>

48:22.109 --> 48:24.695
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

48:24.861 --> 48:26.405
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

48:26.572 --> 48:28.657
<i>Don't you know you're driving</i>

48:28.824 --> 48:33.579
<i>Your mamas and papas insane?</i>

48:33.745 --> 48:35.581
<i>Let me make it plain</i>

48:35.747 --> 48:42.754
<i>You gotta make way for the Homo Superior</i>

48:45.340 --> 48:48.302
<i>Look at your children</i>

48:48.552 --> 48:51.638
<i>See their faces in golden rays</i>

48:51.805 --> 48:55.809
<i>Don't kid yourself they belong to you</i>

48:55.976 --> 48:58.895
<i>They're the start of a coming race</i>

48:59.062 --> 49:00.689
<i>The earth is a bitch</i>

49:00.856 --> 49:03.108
<i>We've finished our news</i>

49:03.275 --> 49:07.779
<i>Homo sapiens have outgrown their use</i>

49:07.946 --> 49:11.825
<i>All the strangers came today</i>

49:11.992 --> 49:16.705
<i>And it looks as though they're here to stay</i>

49:17.623 --> 49:20.083
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

49:20.250 --> 49:21.877
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

49:22.044 --> 49:24.171
<i>Don't you know you're driving</i>

49:24.338 --> 49:30.927
<i>Your mamas and papas insane?</i>

49:31.386 --> 49:33.847
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

49:34.014 --> 49:35.557
<i>Oh, you pretty things</i>

49:35.724 --> 49:37.893
<i>Don't you know you're driving</i>

49:38.060 --> 49:42.606
<i>Your mamas and papas insane?</i>
