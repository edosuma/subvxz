WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:07.508
Narrator: Previously,
the judges battled it out...

00:07.541 --> 00:09.543
If you're smart,
you'll pick me.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.146
...in the search for
America's next MasterChef.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.014
- Whoo-hoo!
- Holy ( bleep ), that's hot.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.217
Only the 24 best home cooks...

00:16.250 --> 00:19.887
- I want someone
who really wants it.
- I'm hungry.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.356
earned a coveted
white apron...

00:22.390 --> 00:25.159
You just started
your dream.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.495
...and a spot
in the competition.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.331
( cheers and applause )

00:30.364 --> 00:35.169
Tonight, the top 24 face
their first mystery box.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.238
Lift!

00:37.271 --> 00:39.707
Oh!

00:39.740 --> 00:41.842
This year things are gonna
be tougher than ever before.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.212
- And...
- Watch carefully.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.380
a high-stakes challenge...

00:46.414 --> 00:47.748
- There we are.
- Whoo!

00:47.781 --> 00:49.016
...turns up the heat.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.751
This is crazy.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.687
Each one of you were given
an apron by one of us three.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.356
Wine and bourbon together?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.258
- And tonight...
- Oh!

00:57.291 --> 00:58.759
( bleep )

00:58.792 --> 01:00.561
...you let us down.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.215
- ( cheering )
- Yeah!

01:21.249 --> 01:23.451
Hello, hello.

01:23.484 --> 01:27.054
Farhan:
I'm so excited to be in the top
24 home cooks in America.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.056
I could be sitting
in the dentist chair right now

01:29.089 --> 01:31.759
operating on somebody,
but instead I get to cook

01:31.792 --> 01:33.961
for Gordon, Aarón, and Joe,

01:33.994 --> 01:35.396
some of the most
renowned food experts

01:35.429 --> 01:37.097
that the world's ever seen.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.600
- Welcome!
- Let's go, Chef!

01:39.633 --> 01:42.270
Stephanie:
I cannot believe that I'm here.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.737
This is the most magnificent

01:43.771 --> 01:45.306
kitchen that I've ever
seen in my life.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.641
Every appliance that you need,

01:47.675 --> 01:51.445
the pantry's fully stocked,
every detail is impeccable.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.081
And seeing "MasterChef"
across the line is, like,

01:54.114 --> 01:56.250
- it's incredible.
- Yes!

01:56.284 --> 01:58.085
Whoo!

01:58.118 --> 01:59.920
I am just so, so excited.

01:59.953 --> 02:04.292
You have to pinch me, because
Gordon Ramsay has chosen me...

02:04.325 --> 02:05.659
Yes!

02:05.693 --> 02:08.629
...to be worthy of the pin
on my apron.

02:08.662 --> 02:13.434
To represent him and his name?
That's big shoes to fill.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.969
So, I have to bring it
every single week.

02:16.003 --> 02:19.607
Welcome to the most famous
kitchen in America.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.677
Thousands tried to make it
where you're standing,

02:23.711 --> 02:27.948
but you are the talented 24
that made it.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.285
One of us gave each of you
an apron.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.954
It's on you to prove

02:33.987 --> 02:39.293
which judge identified
America's next MasterChef.

02:39.327 --> 02:42.796
And with that title
comes some incredible prizes.

02:42.830 --> 02:47.635
Not only will you be crowned
best of the best,

02:47.668 --> 02:51.171
you will win a cool quarter
of a million dollars.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.006
Amazing.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.976
Joe:
And the greatest prize

02:56.009 --> 02:59.380
any home cook can hold
in their hands,

02:59.413 --> 03:02.750
The MasterChef trophy.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.556
The talented eight individuals
that I gave an apron to,

03:08.589 --> 03:12.560
I'll be mentoring all the way
to the finale.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.363
Do me proud.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.731
If I gave you an apron,
you got the heart

03:17.765 --> 03:20.501
and you got the passion
to go all the way,

03:20.534 --> 03:23.571
and you also have me
as your mentor.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.340
If I gave you an apron,
you're being mentored

03:26.374 --> 03:28.342
by one of the world's
most successful

03:28.376 --> 03:31.178
and prolific restaurateurs.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.047
I expect at least two of you
to make the finale.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.017
You guys are currently standing
in the most amazing

03:37.050 --> 03:38.886
kitchen in all of America.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.555
You'll have access
to the finest ingredients

03:41.589 --> 03:44.091
you could ever dream of,

03:44.124 --> 03:46.093
and the best equipment
anywhere around.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.862
We've set you up for success.

03:48.896 --> 03:52.533
The best stoves, the best ovens,
the best equipment--

03:52.566 --> 03:54.735
Viking, they are incredible,

03:54.768 --> 03:58.205
so there is no room
for any excuses.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.040
- All: Yes, Chef.
- Right.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.743
It's time for your very first
mystery box challenge.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.117
On the count of three,
lift your boxes.

04:10.150 --> 04:14.087
- Oh, my God!
- One, two,

04:14.121 --> 04:15.889
three, lift!

04:15.923 --> 04:18.125
- ( woman groans )
- ( man sighs )

04:18.158 --> 04:21.228
- Cheese!
- Cherry.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.732
- T-bone.
- Everybody's thing
is different?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.600
Interesting.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.935
Gordon:
Now, you all have
an ingredient

04:27.968 --> 04:30.304
that is native
from your home states.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.740
An ingredient that screams
where you're from.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.609
- Perfect.
- We wanna see you turn

04:35.643 --> 04:38.412
that incredible ingredient
in front of you

04:38.446 --> 04:40.314
into a dish you, your family,

04:40.348 --> 04:42.583
and your hometown
can be really proud of.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.951
Yes.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.252
The person
with the very best dish

04:45.285 --> 04:47.421
of this mystery box challenge,

04:47.455 --> 04:49.423
will get a huge advantage

04:49.457 --> 04:51.291
in the upcoming
elimination challenge,

04:51.325 --> 04:53.827
which, believe me,
is gonna be very difficult.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.598
You'll have just one hour
to make us one incredible dish

04:57.631 --> 05:00.768
that shows us that you belong
in those aprons.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.338
Your one hour starts...

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
...now!

05:07.641 --> 05:09.109
- Let's go, guys. Come on.
- Out of my way!

05:09.142 --> 05:11.278
Thank God
I wasn't wearing heels.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.213
Showtime, showtime,
showtime!

05:15.048 --> 05:16.450
Blood oranges.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.985
Five-second rule.
It doesn't apply.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.121
I'm all orange
because I'm Florida,

05:21.154 --> 05:22.155
the orange state.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.124
Shrimp, squid.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.460
Being in Miami, there's all
these Latin communities

05:26.494 --> 05:28.662
battling over whose
ceviche is the best.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.531
And I think,
"Okay, I'm gonna do a ceviche."

05:30.564 --> 05:32.332
I'm gonna use
a lot of seafood,

05:32.366 --> 05:34.134
and I'm gonna make sure
that the orange

05:34.167 --> 05:35.636
really wraps
around the proteins.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.204
Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me,

05:37.237 --> 05:39.473
- excuse me, excuse me.
- Where is chicken stock?

05:39.507 --> 05:42.142
Since I'm from China,
I got pork belly.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.977
So I'm making a braised
pork belly,

05:44.011 --> 05:47.347
cauliflower purée,
and caramelized beets.

05:47.381 --> 05:51.151
- Gordon: Okay, let's go!
- I cooked this dish in China,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.053
like, at least three times
a week.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.988
Watch the step.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.857
- Let's go, let's go.
- I got this.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.659
Go sexy or go home.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.496
- Let's go, people!
- Wow, this is it.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.332
For me personally,
one of the most exciting
nights of the year

06:05.365 --> 06:08.502
because it's our first
MasterChef mystery
box challenge,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.170
and it sets the tone.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.205
Here we go.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.174
We've given them each
one ingredient

06:14.207 --> 06:16.376
that represents
their home state.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.345
I'm sorry.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.347
What are we looking for
in those ingredients?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.583
So, first of all,
to pay them respect, Joe.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.052
More importantly, give us
a little modern twist
on what you grew up with.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.688
- Let's go, Texas.
- Aarón: I'm looking
for big, bold flavors,

06:27.721 --> 06:31.091
and something that's a window
into each one of these
home cooks' personal style.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.560
If I mess up this dish,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.061
I'm not gonna get
welcomed back to Texas.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.532
You have to be able
to be versatile,

06:38.566 --> 06:40.934
take an ingredient
that's thrown at you

06:40.968 --> 06:43.070
and execute excellent food

06:43.103 --> 06:45.238
using an ingredient you might
not have chosen yourself.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.207
Let me not cut myself.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.909
( groans )

06:50.143 --> 06:51.712
Get it, baby.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.547
I'm from Los Angeles,
California,

06:53.581 --> 06:56.383
and I got beautiful
California spot prawns.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.418
And even though,
I'm from California,

06:58.452 --> 07:03.891
I am making a New Orleans style
barbecue shrimp.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.258
It's a family recipe.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.561
My grandpa,
he came here from Greece,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.229
and they settled in Louisiana.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.565
And I can't wait for the judges
to taste this.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.266
I am from Houston, Texas,

07:13.300 --> 07:14.935
and today
I got a Texas T-bone.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.403
I feel like I'm in my zone.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.971
I gotta bring
everything I've got.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.474
I am not letting go
of that Gordon Ramsay pin.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.809
I'm from Michigan.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.443
Michigan is known
for their cherry,

07:23.477 --> 07:26.079
so I'm gonna make
cherry stuffed French toast,

07:26.113 --> 07:29.617
with cherry cream cheese,
with a cherry reduction glaze,

07:29.650 --> 07:31.418
and chocolate covered bacon.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.254
Growing up as a kid, my dad
would always make big spread.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.656
My favorite was
the stuffed French toast,

07:35.689 --> 07:37.124
so this is a tribute to him.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.431
- Farhan. What are those
initials on your apron?
- Yes?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.134
- They're your name,
Aarón Sánchez.
- All right, so explain to me

07:47.167 --> 07:49.102
the ingredient that you have
there that you're celebrating.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.938
I'm from Chicago, Illinois.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.440
So we have walleye,
a beautiful white fish.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.843
- And so my plan is
to crush in some spices.
- Mm-hmm.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.778
And I'm gonna do sort of
my mom's home-style potatoes.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.281
So it's using turmeric,
paprika, and mustard seeds.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.483
And for the sauce,
I'm making coconut moilee.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.186
So it's a Southern Indian
coconut based curry.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.656
Something that my mom
makes me every time
I'm home from dental school,

08:08.689 --> 08:09.690
and it really
speaks back to me.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.625
A lot of pride involved,
right?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.293
- Yes, Chef.
- I like to hear that.
Good luck, Farhan.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.461
- Okay, stick with it.
- Thank you, sir.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.530
28 minutes remaining.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.703
- Right, Stephanie.
- Yes, Chef.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.471
Remind us again
where you're from.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.373
I am Cherry Hill,
New Jersey.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.508
Now the ingredients
that screams New Jersey,
what are they?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.678
Yes, the lovely Jersey tomato.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.146
- What are you doing?
- So I'm doing
a tomato frittata.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.816
Gonna do a little bit
of basil, goat cheese,
shallots, some garlic,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.985
red bell pepper, a little
bit of jalapeño for heat.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.987
Nice and spicy,
kinda like me.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.055
I had eight aprons
to give out,

08:42.089 --> 08:43.824
- and you were one of them.
- Yes.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.993
So if you're gonna give me
a frittata on week one,

08:46.026 --> 08:47.394
I need it to be
the best frittata ever.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.664
- I got you, Chef.
- Good luck.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.533
Guys, just over
25 minutes left.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.035
Perfect.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.504
- Hey, Matt. All right.
- Joe, how's it going?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.673
- Team J.B.
How you doing, brother?
- I'm doing all right.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.675
What ingredient did you get
from your home state?

09:01.709 --> 09:04.344
I'm from Iowa, so I got corn.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.379
- What's the dish?
- I'm gonna do
a sweet corn purée.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.181
This is a succotash
with some corn in it.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.549
I'm gonna do chicken
with skin on.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.052
And then I also have some
pan-roasted carrots,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.386
and there's actually
crispy chicken skin.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.188
This is chicken skin?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.857
- That's the chicken skin, yeah.
- That's a nice idea.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.026
- It's a little greasy.
- It's a little greasy.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.928
- Good luck, Matt.
- Thank you, Joe.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.529
Beautiful!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.064
Let's work some magic.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.199
- Juni, what's shaking?
- Hello!

09:26.233 --> 09:27.901
So, you're representing where?
Remind me.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.870
I am from Raleigh,
North Carolina,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.371
and I got sweet potatoes.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.573
Give us a little insight
into your dish.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.876
In North Carolina,
me and my friends, we go out

09:35.909 --> 09:38.111
and we have brunch,
you know, all the time.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.714
So, I'm gonna be making
a sweet potato biscuit,

09:40.748 --> 09:42.382
and I'm gonna add
my Mexican flair to it

09:42.415 --> 09:46.219
by doing chorizo
and a jalapeño hollandaise.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.955
And I'm also gonna be doing
a sweet potato mash.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.422
I think that's
a beautiful thing.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.758
I think it's gonna
tell a nice story.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.960
Best of luck.
Don't let me down.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.928
- I won't.
- I'm counting on you.
You're one of my stars.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.463
- All right?
- All right. I'ma keep
shining bright.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.932
Yes, get it, girl.
Get it.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.600
Oh, this cheese tastes
really, really good.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.569
- Ashley.
- Yeah, Chef.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.071
Remind us
about the ingredient

10:04.104 --> 10:05.405
that you had
under your mystery box.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.575
I had some beautiful
Florida oranges.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.811
So, I'm taking it with
a little Cuban vibe today.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.147
- Okay, good.
- So I'm doing
a pork tenderloin

10:14.181 --> 10:16.817
with fresh mojo,
with a spicy orange
mustard here.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.418
- Good.
- And there's gonna be
some chopped up bacon

10:18.451 --> 10:19.787
that goes into that.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.989
- Careful, Chef.
Careful, Chef.
- ( bleep )

10:23.156 --> 10:24.191
Need some fire.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.597
- You just singed my hair.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.699
It cost a fortune.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.301
Emily.
Tell me the dish.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.169
I'm from Wisconsin.
Cheddar cheese.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.271
- I mean, it's in everything.
- Cheddar cheese, fantastic.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.173
We're doing a baked
mac and cheese,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.609
- using a little bit
of Gruyére and cheddar.
- Wow.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.611
Broccoli stems, which is my
favorite part of the broccoli,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.513
- crispy skin chicken thighs.
- I have to tell you something.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.782
This is one of the most
beautiful chicken thighs
I've ever seen.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.650
- Thank you.
- Just between me and you,

10:50.684 --> 10:53.286
are you the smartest
cook in here?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.856
I think I come with the most
wide breadth of knowledge.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.125
- The smartest contestant
with my apron...
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.527
- Smartest judge.
- ...coached by
the smartest judge.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.195
We got this thing won.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.664
- Good luck.
- Absolutely.
Thank you, sir.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.500
Last six minutes.
Here we go.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.803
- ( grunts )
- Oh, my God, it's perfect.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.505
- Thank you!
- Wow. Fascinating.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.142
I mean, some incredible
sounding dishes.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.644
Emily and Ashley
looking very strong.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.479
Have to do a little bit
more crème fraîche.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.680
Yet I'm really concerned
with Stephanie.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.215
She's doing a frittata.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.184
She's doing an omelet
in the mystery box?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.386
- I can make that
in five minutes.
- Sal, how you doing?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.989
Um, I'm feeling good
about my flavors.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.891
I'm a little bit
concerned about Sal.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.326
He was given
the Santa Barbara
spot prawn,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.162
and he's making
a New Orleans dish.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.697
Aarón:
Yeah, it sounds really
confused and scattered.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.334
90 seconds remaining.
Come on.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.669
Joe:
You should definitely be getting
the food on the plate.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.072
Got it.

11:45.105 --> 11:49.009
We wanna taste your states
on those plates, guys. Come on.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.845
Last minute. Come on.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.546
Aarón:
Taste, taste, taste.
Let's go.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.716
Get a beautiful portion
out there. Let's go.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.523
Chefs:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

12:03.556 --> 12:07.895
five, four, three, two, one.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.729
- Gordon: And stop!
- Joe: And stop!

12:09.763 --> 12:11.398
- Hands in the air.
- ( cheering )

12:17.570 --> 12:21.408
Joe, Aarón, and myself
watched you all very carefully

12:21.441 --> 12:22.709
across that mystery box
challenge.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.546
Some of you
really impressed us.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.382
Each judge will bring up one
of the talented cooks

12:29.416 --> 12:32.285
that they gave an apron to.

12:32.319 --> 12:36.389
Joe:
The first dish tonight is
from a home cook

12:36.423 --> 12:40.427
that I personally put
into this competition.

12:40.460 --> 12:45.232
They made comfort food
with old style flavors.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.601
Please step forward...

12:48.635 --> 12:51.571
Emily.
Bring it up.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.473
Wisconsin is in the house.
I mean, I think being

12:53.506 --> 12:55.608
in the top three
in the first challenge,

12:55.642 --> 12:57.410
is definitely putting me
up there

12:57.444 --> 12:59.412
as someone that is
a major competitor.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.582
And I think everyone should
definitely watch out.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.251
Okay, Emily.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.585
So, you're from?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.587
- Wisconsin.
- Wisconsin.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.822
And your ingredient was?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.257
It was cheddar cheese.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.624
You're kind of a Cheesehead,
aren't you?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.160
I am a Cheesehead to the max.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.661
- Packer backer.
- Packer backer.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.297
All right,
what's the dish?

13:17.330 --> 13:20.167
So we have a broccoli cheddar
Mac and Cheese,

13:20.200 --> 13:21.935
topped with crispy
chicken thigh.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.770
We have a little
Gremolata bread crumb on top,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.172
crispy broccoli tops,

13:25.205 --> 13:29.009
and then a white wine
cheddar sauce on the side.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.610
Mac and cheese,
you made cheddar.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.279
Did you put any other kind
of cheese in there?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.813
Gruyére.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.187
I have to say,
Gruyére and cheddar,

13:40.220 --> 13:42.455
two great cheeses
of the world put together.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.458
And you can really taste that,
because they do work well
with each other.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.827
But what's really
impressive here is that
everything is cooked.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.031
Like, this chicken thigh
is about as textbook
as you can get.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.967
Moist in the middle,
crispy on the outside.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.136
I think you're a smart cook.
This is a smart dish.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.139
- Very, very impressed.
Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.841
Miss Emily,
do you feel that

14:01.875 --> 14:03.310
out of your fellow
competitors here,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.345
you're more informed
food-wise

14:05.378 --> 14:06.713
- by virtue of what you do?
- Yes.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.482
Food is my life.
So, food anthropology--

14:09.516 --> 14:11.684
Now I work on the research side
of the food service industry.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.687
What you did here
that's so expert

14:14.721 --> 14:16.856
is the idea of cooking down
that broccoli in such a way

14:16.890 --> 14:18.658
that it gives you that
beautiful, almost sulfuric

14:18.691 --> 14:20.560
taste to it, which is great.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.395
The cook on the chicken
is expert.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.497
I think maybe cut
that chicken in such a way

14:24.531 --> 14:26.833
that it's a little bit
better incorporated.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.168
Cut chicken's gonna run out
before the pasta does.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.702
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?

14:29.736 --> 14:31.738
I hate to say this and give Joe
any kind of credit,

14:31.771 --> 14:34.507
but he definitely saw something
in you right away,

14:34.541 --> 14:37.044
and it's evident in the overall
execution of this dish.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.913
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.216
Chicken's amazing. I mean,
that's how we cook chicken

14:43.250 --> 14:45.218
in the restaurant.
It's to that standard.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.021
I love what you did
with the presentation.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.722
It's like it's out
of a gastropub.

14:49.756 --> 14:52.192
Wow.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.527
Very cool, very hip,
very modern.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.196
This dish is
a 90-minute dish

14:56.229 --> 14:57.764
and you've made it
in 60 minutes.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.432
So, you've really thought
about it properly.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.868
When you think like that
in this competition,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.703
you're gonna go far.
Great job.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.405
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.545
So the second dish that we would
like to dive deeper into,

15:12.579 --> 15:15.048
a dish created by a home cook

15:15.082 --> 15:17.417
that I brought
into this kitchen.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.053
Tonight, they showcased
an impressive display

15:20.087 --> 15:22.889
of culinary technique.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.125
Please step forward...

15:25.158 --> 15:26.426
Farhan.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.562
( cheering )

15:29.596 --> 15:31.798
I'm on cloud nine. Wow!

15:31.831 --> 15:33.566
The top three
out of 24 people.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.302
It's incredible.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.737
I think it shows
the other competitors

15:37.770 --> 15:39.072
that, hey, I'm not
just a dental student.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.473
I'm a serious chef

15:40.507 --> 15:41.808
and I know what I'm doing
in the kitchen.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.279
All right, so, Farhan,
you're representing Illinois.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.115
Talk to me
about your dish.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.417
Farhan:
I had some fantastic walleye.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.919
So I made my own little
spice blend using
the long peppercorns.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.654
Crusted the fish,
pan-seared it,

15:54.687 --> 15:56.956
and then it's my mom's
home-style potatoes,

15:56.990 --> 15:59.292
and then the bottom's
a coconut moilee sauce.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.128
And the spice rub
I created myself.

16:01.161 --> 16:05.465
It has a lot of fennel,
mustard seed, cumin, coriander.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.101
That's what I really wanted
to shine through.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.104
I gotta say, you did
such an unbelievable job

16:11.138 --> 16:13.940
getting a crispy skin
outside of that fish.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.842
By seasoning it
with such a generous hand,

16:15.875 --> 16:17.944
you were able to blossom
all those spices.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.279
They became alive.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.114
You allowed them
to be harmonious,

16:21.148 --> 16:22.815
but not overpower
a very delicate fish.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.484
That's the genius of this dish
for me, personally.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.619
The potatoes are great.
They're kinda cooked down.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.821
They're a little rustic
in nature.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.124
I think the sauce is very
pungent and very strong.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.959
I mean, you could've
toned down the amount of it.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.661
- Yes.
- Allowed it to be
a little more brothy.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.364
But overall,
I think all the components

16:37.397 --> 16:39.966
are strictly you,
strictly unique.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.634
And that's
why I gave you an apron.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.869
Thank you, Chef.
It's an honor.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.339
Farhan, why so much spice?

16:46.373 --> 16:47.807
I find comfort in spices.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.476
So I use spices
as my paint colors

16:49.509 --> 16:52.712
- and the plate is my canvas.
- Fish, stunning.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.848
You know, it's got that heat.
It's moist. It's crispy.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.317
The sauce, delicious.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.551
And I love those potatoes.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.053
It could be
a little bit crispier.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.388
You know, if you want
that sort of texture.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.390
But here's the thing,

17:03.423 --> 17:05.492
you've got such control
over your cooking,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.994
but also you've got that
level of finesse as well.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.364
You know your spice.
You are an original spice boy.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.567
- Brilliant. Well done.
- Thank you.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.507
Gordon:
Wow, what a start.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.042
The third and final dish
we'd like to taste

17:23.076 --> 17:25.578
is from the home cook
that I gave an apron to.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.015
This dish had a lot of flair,
great harmony.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.085
Taylor:
I'm looking at my dish,
and I know it tastes amazing.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.720
I want this so bad.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.255
Please step forward...

17:35.288 --> 17:37.124
Please say my name,
please say my name.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.100
The third and final dish
we'd like to taste

17:47.134 --> 17:49.936
from tonight's mystery box
challenge

17:49.969 --> 17:52.205
is from the home cook
that I gave an apron to.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.875
This dish had a lot of flare,
great harmony.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.044
Please step forward...

17:58.077 --> 18:00.713
Ashley. Thank you.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.050
Taylor:
I'm happy for Ashley,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.753
but I'm disappointed
I'm not in the top three.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.557
I just really wanted
to impress Gordon.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.460
So, I have to step it up
moving forward.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.430
Ashley,
describe the dish, please.

18:17.464 --> 18:22.635
So, I got those beautiful
Florida oranges.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.905
And the dish is a mojo
pork tenderloin,

18:25.938 --> 18:28.741
which is a herb, garlic,
and citrus marinade

18:28.775 --> 18:31.744
with mashed sweet plantain,

18:31.778 --> 18:35.081
and the sauce is orange juice,
yellow mustard,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.284
dry mustard,
and orange blossom honey.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.952
Mm-hmm.
And then the mash?

18:39.986 --> 18:41.788
So, those are sweet plantains

18:41.821 --> 18:43.923
that I've mashed with some
crème fraîche, bacon,

18:43.956 --> 18:47.694
some parsley, orange juice,
and orange zest.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.763
Wow. Delicious.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.765
The pork tenderloin's amazing.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.468
I love the sear.
I love the way you sliced it.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.936
The glaze of the oranges,
it's just delicious.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.305
Pork and orange,
it goes hand and glove,

18:58.338 --> 18:59.806
and so it's
a lovely combination.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.674
But it's more
than the glaze,

19:01.708 --> 19:03.676
'cause it's got that spice,
it's got the heat.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.945
- It packs a punch.
- Thank you, Chef.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.449
When you start to shine
this early on
in the competition,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.518
not only does it send
a strong message

19:11.551 --> 19:13.620
to everybody
standing behind you,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.622
but for me it confirms

19:15.655 --> 19:18.358
that I was 100% correct
handing you that apron.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.027
- Thank you so much.
- Amazing.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.867
Great technique
on the sauce.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.370
The pork loin is
perfectly cooked.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.339
The colors are appealing.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.641
If I came to your house
for a dinner party

19:34.674 --> 19:37.310
and you gave me a plate
of food like this,
I would be happy.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.812
But if I went to
a restaurant in Miami

19:39.846 --> 19:41.314
and was paying $100
for dinner,

19:41.348 --> 19:42.815
I would probably expect
a little bit more.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.485
So, I think, Ashley,
your evolution is gonna

19:45.518 --> 19:47.654
be seeing how
you can evolve the plate

19:47.687 --> 19:49.689
and make them a little bit more
"restauranty," if you will.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.825
- Okay.
- Because it's "MasterChef."

19:52.859 --> 19:54.193
- Yes.
- Not MasterHomeCook.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.529
- Correct. Yes, Chef.
- Got it?

19:56.563 --> 19:59.499
- Good job.
- Thank you.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.335
- ( whispering )
Congratulations.
- You, too. Thank you.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.337
Gordon:
Three great dishes.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.707
Emily's dish was
really impressive.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.342
Good, but just...

20:09.376 --> 20:11.678
Aarón:
I like Ashley's.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.013
Ashley, you know, the oranges--
I mean, they stuck out.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.548
Ashley's plate
was too sweet for me.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.083
- Emily and Farhan for me.
- Yeah.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.552
Gordon: And Farhan,
a little bit too spicy.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.720
That's true.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.057
Three incredible,
sophisticated dishes

20:25.091 --> 20:27.226
that really shone beautifully,

20:27.260 --> 20:29.128
but there can only
be one winner.

20:30.897 --> 20:35.034
Tonight's winner--
congratulations goes to

20:35.067 --> 20:36.736
the dish that was cooked by...

20:40.573 --> 20:42.409
Ashley, congratulations.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.312
- Aah! Oh, my God!
- Congratulations.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.416
Gordon:
You're safe from elimination.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.051
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.454
Now, take your well-earned place
up on the balcony.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.423
- ( squeals )
- Off you go.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.962
Ashley:
I wanted to make Gordon proud,

21:02.995 --> 21:05.398
and winning this
first challenge validates

21:05.432 --> 21:07.266
the pin on my apron.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.568
Please return
to your stations.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.637
With me as a mentee,

21:10.670 --> 21:15.442
I'm gonna be high risk,
high reward every single time.

21:15.475 --> 21:19.412
Each one of you were given
an apron by one of us three.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.148
We handed out those aprons,

21:22.181 --> 21:23.783
'cause we believe
in your ability,

21:23.816 --> 21:26.285
your passion,
and your potential.

21:26.319 --> 21:29.822
And tonight,
three of you let us down.

21:29.856 --> 21:33.493
Each judge now has to identify

21:33.526 --> 21:37.129
just one home cook
that we gave an apron to

21:37.163 --> 21:42.301
to go into a three-way battle
for survival.

21:42.335 --> 21:47.273
The home cook that I gave
an apron to let me down tonight

21:47.306 --> 21:50.477
because you didn't
use your time wisely.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.946
Sid.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.816
The home cook
that I felt let me down--

21:56.849 --> 22:01.287
this dish was overly sweet,
the plating was a mess.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.156
That home cook is...

22:04.190 --> 22:05.792
Alecia.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.496
The home cook
that I gave an apron to

22:09.529 --> 22:13.132
put so much grease on the plate
that it was inedible.

22:13.165 --> 22:18.004
The home cook that will be
cooking again tonight is...

22:19.706 --> 22:21.207
...Sal.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.675
What can I say?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.343
Really let me down.

22:24.377 --> 22:27.346
Gordon:
Sid, Alecia, Sal,

22:27.380 --> 22:29.348
all three of you
come up to the front.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.551
Everybody else,
head up to the balcony.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.386
Alecia:
I am disappointed

22:33.420 --> 22:35.988
'cause I played it safe
with the French toast.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.357
I've always been a fighter
and I feel I kind of

22:38.391 --> 22:39.992
let my family down.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.828
I'm definitely going
to step it up

22:41.861 --> 22:43.830
and just show Chef Aarón

22:43.863 --> 22:46.032
I deserve this apron
and I'm going to make him proud.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.872
Gordon:
For survival tonight,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.708
I want all three of you
to make your version

22:55.742 --> 22:57.677
of this classic
all-American dish,

22:57.710 --> 23:00.046
a dish that
America was built on.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.350
Tonight, I'll show you

23:04.383 --> 23:08.187
how I make steak
and mashed potatoes.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.690
Steak and potatoes
may seem simple,

23:10.723 --> 23:14.026
but they are surprisingly
difficult to get right.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.227
Make a mistake tonight,

23:15.261 --> 23:17.764
and it is a giant
disappointment.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.600
But before I show
two of you the door,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.902
I'll give you an insight
to how I perfect mine.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.574
We season both sides,

23:27.607 --> 23:29.041
every ounce of that steak.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.577
Pan on, piping hot.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.911
Tablespoon of oil in.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.046
Roll it around.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.383
A couple of cloves of garlic,
fresh thyme.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.951
You want great sear
on the steak?

23:38.985 --> 23:41.220
90 seconds each side.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.290
Once we got a great sear,
we go in with the butter.

23:44.323 --> 23:48.461
Tilt the back of the pan
so it cooks that line of fat,

23:48.495 --> 23:50.763
and baste.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.400
Out she comes.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.736
And then from there,
we let that sit.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.771
And now we're gonna
start the sauce.

23:58.805 --> 24:02.575
Touch of butter in there.
Put those shallots in there.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.277
From there, deglaze--
a touch of cognac.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.284
From there,
add beautiful beef stock,

24:12.318 --> 24:15.822
a tablespoon of demi,
a little hint of cream.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.791
That will thicken it up.
Now, mashed potatoes.

24:18.825 --> 24:22.662
Make sure that once you cook
the potatoes, you steam them.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.497
You start mashing.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.766
Now I'm gonna start working in
my cream and my butter.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.768
Finish off
with some fresh chives,

24:28.801 --> 24:32.271
and you've got the most amazing,
beautiful mashed potatoes.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.440
And in my house
here in America,

24:34.473 --> 24:38.144
that's exactly how we perfect
steak and mash.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.953
Now, tonight, it's not
three cook and one goes home.

24:46.986 --> 24:51.223
Three will cook
and only one will be safe.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.128
I was this close
to the elimination challenge,

24:56.162 --> 24:58.364
and knowing that two of
the three cooks are going home,

24:58.397 --> 25:00.800
odds are definitely not good.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.969
Thank goodness
I'm not down there.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.404
I'm glad I'm not you
right now.

25:12.545 --> 25:16.015
Tonight, it's not three cook
and one goes home.

25:16.048 --> 25:20.720
Three will cook
and only one will be safe.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.856
Aarón:
Sal, Alecia, Sid, we want you
to make your version,

25:23.890 --> 25:27.727
a steak and mash that can keep
you in the competition.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.996
Joe:
Now, for two of you,

25:30.029 --> 25:32.665
this is your last 30 minutes
in the MasterChef kitchen.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.366
- Got it?
- Yes, Joe.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.503
Your 30 minutes starts...

25:37.536 --> 25:39.205
...now.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.241
( cheering )

25:44.376 --> 25:46.178
Alecia:
Back home in Michigan,

25:46.212 --> 25:48.014
I cook steak and mash
for my husband

25:48.047 --> 25:50.349
- at least once a week.
- Cheese, cheese, cheese.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.685
So I definitely feel like
I'm going to nail this

25:52.719 --> 25:54.854
and prove to the judges
that this girl

25:54.887 --> 25:56.055
can cook her ass off.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.525
I definitely think
I have an advantage

25:59.558 --> 26:00.860
because I grew up
cooking steaks

26:00.893 --> 26:03.763
out over an open fire
on our ranch.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.198
So, I know I got this
in the bag.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.034
Let's go, guys!

26:08.067 --> 26:10.402
( cheering )

26:10.436 --> 26:12.204
All right, so, Gordon,
what needs to happen

26:12.238 --> 26:15.041
in these 30 minutes in order
for them to be successful?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.542
Gordon:
Tonight I want their version
of steak of mash,

26:16.575 --> 26:18.945
but, you know, evolve it.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.381
In the simplicity
of this challenge,

26:22.414 --> 26:25.117
you have three of the most
difficult "MasterChef" problems.

26:25.151 --> 26:28.587
Wrong wine in the sauce,
undercooked potatoes,

26:28.621 --> 26:31.057
and temperature on meat.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.960
The pressure's immense tonight.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.395
There's only one person staying,
so the pressure is really on.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.597
My heart is pounding.
It's like an adrenaline rush.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.566
It's something like
I've never done before.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.568
I've jumped out of planes
and had less of a rush.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.738
- Let's go, Alecia!
- Come on.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.573
I ain't giving up, guys.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.908
I wanna be here so bad.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.442
I'm in it to win it,
no matter what,

26:50.476 --> 26:52.078
and nothing's gonna stop me,

26:52.111 --> 26:54.613
because
I'm the next MasterChef.

26:54.647 --> 26:58.084
Sorry, boys, but this girl
is here to stay.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.286
Gordon:
21 minutes remaining.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.089
- Here we go, baby.
- First thing, start the mash.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.491
And the secret behind
a great mash is cut
the dice smaller,

27:05.524 --> 27:08.494
so they cook quicker,
and then let them steam.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.830
I got it, guys.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.264
Gordon: From there,
get that cast-iron pan on,

27:12.298 --> 27:14.266
and get it absolutely
piping hot.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.602
Take the steak out,
season it beautifully.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.971
Gotta get that steak in.

27:19.005 --> 27:22.141
Gordon,
what does a medium-rare
look like for you?

27:22.174 --> 27:24.310
A great sear, top and bottom,
sides as well,

27:24.343 --> 27:26.779
so there's no visible
white fat anywhere.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.347
- Woman: Ooh, there we go!
- From there, start the sauce.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.482
The sauce can go
a million directions.

27:30.516 --> 27:33.619
Cream based, brandy based,
mushrooms.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.521
15 minutes remaining.

27:35.554 --> 27:37.123
- Halfway.
- Come on, guys. Let's go!

27:37.156 --> 27:39.291
All right, Sal.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.626
I'd hate to lose one
of my team members

27:40.659 --> 27:43.295
on this first
elimination test.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.530
What are you doing
to personalize it?

27:44.563 --> 27:46.866
So I'm gonna do
a Parmesan mash.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.868
Gonna throw a little bit
of butter and cream in there.

27:48.901 --> 27:52.504
I'm gonna make a sauce
with a little bit
of wine and bourbon.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.006
Wine and bourbon together?

27:55.341 --> 27:57.009
( squealing )

27:57.043 --> 27:59.712
Uh, you know...

27:59.746 --> 28:02.048
I guess, I'm gonna go
with the wine.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.349
Learn and listen.
Good luck.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.683
Yes, sir.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.554
Right, Sid.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.222
Give me an insight into
your steak and mash.
What are you doing?

28:10.256 --> 28:14.326
I'm making steak
with a golden Yukon
mashed potatoes.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.829
My father would always
do his creamed mushrooms
and onions.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.330
So the bed for that steak

28:18.364 --> 28:20.532
is gonna be
in reference to my dad.

28:20.566 --> 28:23.335
You can do this.
I wanna see the Sid I met
when I gave you that apron.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.670
- Please. Let's go.
- Yes, Chef. Thank you.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.038
Ashley:
Keep it up, Sid.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.940
Put some love
into that food.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.543
- Alecia, how you doing?
- I'm doing perfect, Chef.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.079
So give me a description
of your dish.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.580
My husband is definitely
a meat and potatoes kinda guy.

28:34.613 --> 28:36.182
He loves steak.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.051
So, right now
I'm making a mushroom

28:39.085 --> 28:41.720
and onion glazed steak
with a loaded mash,

28:41.754 --> 28:43.722
with heavy cream, butter,
chives, bacon,

28:43.756 --> 28:45.691
and made with a lot of love.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.194
Right. So, look,
I haven't given up
on you at all, okay?

28:48.227 --> 28:50.196
I believe in you.
I know you're gonna
follow through.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.730
Yeah, I'm ready. Yep.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.565
Don't give up, okay?
You're doing great.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.537
- Smells good in here.
- Yeah, it smells great.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.572
- 10 minutes remaining.
- Ashley: Come on, Alecia.

29:00.606 --> 29:04.243
Alecia's steak is out.
Sal as well.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.078
- Sid's steak is out.
- Looking good, Sid.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.082
- Yeah, Sid!
- Whoo!

29:10.116 --> 29:12.885
- ( applause )
- Way to go, Sid.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.621
Oh, Sid's flaming up
some brandy.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.893
All right, Sid. This is what?

29:20.927 --> 29:23.762
That is hot.

29:23.796 --> 29:27.133
What is it, though?
You falling asleep here?

29:27.166 --> 29:28.901
No, I'm not falling asleep.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.436
No, you're not
falling asleep.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.071
That is gonna be my sauce.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.240
- That's your sauce?
- Yes.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.908
You want it that syrupy?

29:35.942 --> 29:37.977
Uh, I'll thin it down
a little bit.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.912
Sid, do you have
the stamina to do this?
Are you tired?

29:39.946 --> 29:43.249
Yes, sir, I do. Uh...

29:43.282 --> 29:45.651
- All right, Sid, good luck.
- Thank you, Joe.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.319
Coarse salt.

29:47.353 --> 29:48.821
Wow. Fascinating.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.990
So, I'm a little bit
concerned about Sid.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.926
Okay, so...

29:53.960 --> 29:57.429
So Sid has made,
like, a cognac sauce,

29:57.463 --> 29:58.797
but he over-reduced it.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.266
It's like syrup
at this point,

30:00.299 --> 30:01.467
so kind of going against

30:01.500 --> 30:03.635
everything that
you demonstrated.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.637
- Potato masher.
- He looks flustered.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.606
Potato masher?

30:07.639 --> 30:08.941
Sid's running
a little bit behind.

30:08.975 --> 30:11.010
Sid is just kind of
discombobulated.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.112
He's running to the pantry
and grabbing different things.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.780
Where is the potato masher?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.448
It's not looking good for Sid.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.450
I cannot find a potato masher
for the life of me.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.986
Oh, my God.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.988
- ( sighs ) Oh, dear.
- ( mumbling ) Salt.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.829
( mumbling ) Salt.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.999
Joe:
So, I'm a little bit
concerned about Sid.

30:33.032 --> 30:36.002
- Sid looks flustered.
- Potato masher?

30:36.035 --> 30:37.336
Sid's running
a little bit behind.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.171
( groaning )
Come on.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.372
Poor Sid.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.174
He is a little frazzled.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.675
Where is the potato masher?

30:43.709 --> 30:46.078
Get it together
or you're going home.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.680
I cannot find a potato masher
for the life of me.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.082
Oh, my God.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.117
Oh, dear.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.354
There it is.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.588
Oh, dear.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.091
Last three minutes.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.894
That's still plenty time
to finish off, guys.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.362
Fresh chives, fresh parsley,

31:03.395 --> 31:05.364
make sure that mash
is not too wet.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.533
- Beautiful.
- Alecia right now is in front
of both the guys.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.236
Yep. Absolutely. She has
a fighting spirit right now.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.438
You can see she's animated,
she's moving quickly.

31:12.471 --> 31:15.541
Gordon:
Sal, unfortunately,
made a stupid mistake.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.209
Didn't flambé that sauce.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.211
Finish strong, finish strong.
Come on.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.048
Last minute to go.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.916
- Aarón: You got it, Sid.
- It looks so tasty.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.551
Gordon:
Start thinking
about your plating.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.753
- Taste everything.
- Joe: We're looking for

31:27.786 --> 31:30.556
a classic American
steak and potato dish,

31:30.589 --> 31:32.458
one you would serve
to your family at home.

31:32.491 --> 31:36.895
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

31:36.929 --> 31:41.233
five, four, three, two, one.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.769
- And stop!
- ( cheers and applause )

31:43.802 --> 31:46.138
- Yes!
- Flavor, flavor, flavor.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.109
All three of you, well done.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.743
Very carefully bring your dishes
down to the front, please.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.646
- Let's go.
- I'm so happy with my dish.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.116
I know I perfectly nailed
the sear on my steak.

31:57.149 --> 32:01.487
But, please, baby Jesus,
let it be medium rare.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.090
Two people are going home.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.524
I have no room for error.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.461
All right, Sal,
first thing's first.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.263
You are wearing my pin.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.765
I'm not here to save you,
or anyone for that matter.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.601
All decisions
will be informed

32:15.634 --> 32:18.270
by the opinion
of the three judges
together, okay?

32:18.304 --> 32:19.972
- Is that clear? Okay.
- Yes, sir.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.173
What's the dish?

32:21.207 --> 32:23.109
I made a pan-seared steak,

32:23.142 --> 32:25.111
with a red wine
reduction sauce

32:25.144 --> 32:27.980
and some Parmesan cheese
mashed potatoes.

32:31.650 --> 32:34.020
Mmm.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.624
You caramelized
the steak well.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.693
Too bad you cooked it
a perfect medium

32:41.727 --> 32:44.063
instead of a perfect
medium-rare.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.866
The sauce, for me,
is too thick.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.701
You're definitely missing some
technique on the potatoes.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.171
The flavor of
Parmesan is good.
That's a plus.

32:52.204 --> 32:57.043
But when it starts
to taste like-- like glue,
that consistency means

32:57.076 --> 32:59.978
that you let the starch build up
in the potato itself too much.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.213
Yes, sir.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.349
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.324
The cook on the steak--

33:12.358 --> 33:15.494
I mean, we're talking a minute
from being medium-rare,

33:15.527 --> 33:17.529
so I'm not gonna really
take you to task on that.

33:17.563 --> 33:20.066
I'm gonna tell you
where this needs a lot
of work and improvement.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.900
I don't like
the sauce at all.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.036
It's very reduced.
It's gelatinous.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.704
It needed to be
developed a lot more

33:25.737 --> 33:27.373
by cooking
the shallots out,

33:27.406 --> 33:30.076
and it just tastes like
it's not developed yet.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.244
It needs to be
realized over time,

33:32.278 --> 33:34.680
and it's just hard
to overlook that.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.516
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.718
( whispering )
I don't ever wanna
be down there.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.520
Alecia, describe
the dish, please.

33:41.553 --> 33:45.857
I have a seared steak
with a mushroom onion sauce,

33:45.891 --> 33:49.261
with a mashed potato
loaded with bacon,

33:49.295 --> 33:51.930
scallions,
and salt and pepper,

33:51.963 --> 33:53.299
cream and butter.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.773
Now that's perfect.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.409
( whispering )
Yes. Thank you.

34:03.442 --> 34:07.113
That is beautifully done.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.115
So, the base of the sauce,
what's in there?

34:09.148 --> 34:12.384
I started off with butter,
and then garlic, thyme,

34:12.418 --> 34:15.287
mushrooms, onions.

34:15.321 --> 34:19.225
And then I added red wine,
a little bit of beef stock,

34:19.258 --> 34:20.426
and at the end, I added cream.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.761
So, steak is delicious.

34:22.794 --> 34:24.096
Really good, indeed.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.564
The color on
the steak is beautiful.

34:25.597 --> 34:28.434
However, for me,

34:28.467 --> 34:30.802
visually, a little bit
scrappy on the plate.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.938
A little bit loose
in terms of the fat.

34:32.971 --> 34:36.308
So, big no-no there.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.445
I wish you'd plated that
with some finesse.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.814
It's just a shame
you didn't dress it
a little bit better.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.417
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.320
- Alecia.
- Chef.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.958
Mmm.

34:52.991 --> 34:56.628
The cook on the steak
is spot-on perfect.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.500
I think the potatoes
are great,

35:01.533 --> 35:04.770
but the garnish
is a little confusing.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.938
I feel like it's one
of the basting elements

35:06.972 --> 35:08.174
that you should've omitted

35:08.207 --> 35:10.276
and not put on your
presentation.

35:10.309 --> 35:13.445
So, my concern
is that sloppiness,

35:13.479 --> 35:15.781
because it can be
that make or break.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.449
I wanna make
you proud, Chef.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.151
I see so much finesse

35:19.185 --> 35:21.119
in the way that
you cooked the steak,

35:21.153 --> 35:23.522
but now I gotta
really think about
is that enough

35:23.555 --> 35:25.524
to keep you
in this competition.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.993
Thank you, Chef.

35:28.026 --> 35:30.128
- Sid. Food photographer.
- Yes, sir.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.630
- Yes, sir.
- What's the dish?

35:31.663 --> 35:35.367
This is a sautéed
herb crusted steak,

35:35.401 --> 35:37.169
with a beef stock,
sautéed onions,

35:37.203 --> 35:38.870
and mushroom sauce,

35:38.904 --> 35:41.173
and a little bit of golden
Yukon mashed potatoes.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.175
So, it should be red
in the middle.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.143
Kind of the same as hers,
nice crust on the outside,

35:45.177 --> 35:48.013
pink with
a dead red center.

35:48.046 --> 35:49.515
Correct.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.016
What this steak looks like

35:51.049 --> 35:53.185
could be the difference
between you staying here

35:53.219 --> 35:56.755
in this competition
or heading home.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.759
Let's see.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.233
Wow.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.373
Sid, what this
steak looks like

36:14.406 --> 36:16.542
could be the difference
between you staying here

36:16.575 --> 36:20.346
in this competition
or heading home.

36:20.379 --> 36:24.182
Let's see.
What do we got?

36:24.216 --> 36:26.418
Ooh! Wow.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.455
- Wow.
- Another perfectly cooked
medium-rare steak.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.758
( whispering )
That looks really good, yeah.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.363
It's rendered properly,

36:37.396 --> 36:39.698
and you do have
a nice crust on it,

36:39.731 --> 36:42.601
but those onions
and mushrooms?

36:42.634 --> 36:44.770
You see, these
you cooked separately
from the pan sauce, right?

36:44.803 --> 36:49.040
And the consequence of that
is your sauce is broke.

36:49.074 --> 36:52.244
Your potatoes are a nice try
to achieve what Gordon did,

36:52.278 --> 36:54.212
but they lack salt
and are lumpy.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.382
So, some pros and cons, Sid.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.384
( sighs )

36:58.417 --> 37:00.652
( whispering )
I feel so bad for Sid.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.758
Have a little taste
of that bit there.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.060
Right.
A little taste there.

37:09.094 --> 37:12.498
Sid, one thing that needs--

37:13.499 --> 37:14.900
You know it, I know it.

37:14.933 --> 37:19.738
- Pepper.
- Steak's cooked nicely.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.307
It's lacking seasoning.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.310
The sauce is broke.
The mash is okay.

37:24.343 --> 37:28.414
But as always,
with anyone
I give an apron to,

37:28.447 --> 37:30.616
or anyone in this competition,
I just want more.

37:30.649 --> 37:35.587
Every time we cook
in this kitchen,
cook for your life.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.457
- I understand, Chef.
- Thank you.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.125
Thank you.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.295
Okay, you three,

37:43.329 --> 37:45.364
please come around
to the front.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.673
We each gave one
of you an apron.

37:54.706 --> 37:59.511
So this, for us,
is a very big decision.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.213
We need a moment.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.520
- A steak and mash
are a staple.
- Yeah.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.522
They should've all nailed it,
but they didn't.

38:10.556 --> 38:13.525
Joe:
Alecia's dish, the sauce
bumbled a little bit.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.661
Yeah, but she really did
the best job with
the cook on the steak.

38:15.694 --> 38:16.962
Yeah.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.497
Joe:
Sal just doesn't listen.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.699
I think there were just
so many technical problems

38:20.732 --> 38:22.534
with his sauce and procedures

38:22.568 --> 38:24.135
that it all kind of
fell apart in the end.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.971
I mean,
we asked for medium-rare.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.639
The other two
delivered medium-rare.
He didn't.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.675
Aarón:
The cook was proper
on Sid's steak.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.377
Gordon:
It was medium-rare.
He got that right.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.144
You could go back to that steak
anytime throughout dinner

38:33.178 --> 38:34.813
and it'll still be juicy
from top to bottom.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.815
But he forgot
the most important thing,
the seasoning.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.317
Only one of these
home cooks will stay

38:39.351 --> 38:41.152
in the MasterChef kitchen.
Touch decision.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.988
Yeah, it's a tough one. Yeah.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.023
Let's do it.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.324
My heart's beating fast.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.693
Bad luck.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.202
Man, tough first night
in the MasterChef kitchen.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.671
We're gonna lose
two home cooks tonight

38:59.705 --> 39:02.574
that we have given aprons to.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.510
Sal, tell me, do you think
you're staying?

39:04.543 --> 39:07.546
- Yes or no?
- Yes, Chef.

39:09.881 --> 39:13.685
- Sid, are you staying?
- Yes, I am staying, Chef.

39:13.719 --> 39:17.355
Alecia, are you staying?

39:17.389 --> 39:18.890
Yes, Chef.
I'm here to stay.

39:18.924 --> 39:23.729
Alecia, you have made
mistakes tonight,

39:23.762 --> 39:26.432
but here's one thing
you have got right.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.869
You are staying.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.439
Take yourself up
into the balcony.

39:33.472 --> 39:34.473
Well done.

39:39.645 --> 39:43.615
- Good job, Alecia.
- Congrats.

39:43.649 --> 39:46.585
Alecia:
This feeling is just amazing.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.219
Like, this takes the cake.

39:48.253 --> 39:49.555
Thank you, Jesus.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.389
I know that my children
at the daycare

39:51.423 --> 39:53.559
are shouting for,
"Miss Alecia! Miss Alecia!"

39:53.592 --> 39:56.795
And I just know
that my family back home
will be so proud of me.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.397
This time gone from them
is not wasted.

39:59.431 --> 40:00.832
This is all for us.

40:06.472 --> 40:09.975
Sal, Sid, not a good night
for you two.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.178
The dishes didn't work
in the end. Sorry.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.783
I'm very humbled
to be able to make food

40:17.816 --> 40:20.619
for three wonderful judges,
and it's been an honor.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.622
I'm gonna continue mastering
the way I can cook

40:23.655 --> 40:26.658
to at least absorb
what you've taught me here.

40:26.692 --> 40:29.595
Sal, Sid,
don't stop cooking.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.429
- Thank you, Chef.
- Gentlemen,

40:31.463 --> 40:35.701
can you please leave
your aprons at your stations.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.470
One love, fam.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.939
- Love you guys.
- Way to go, Sal.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.141
Let's go, guys.
Go, Sal, Sid.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.177
It's disappointing me that
I didn't go a lot further here.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.014
Just sometimes
pressure hits you

40:49.047 --> 40:50.816
and everything breaks down.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.852
But this has inspired me,
so I'm not gonna stop.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.488
I'm too young to stop.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.156
- Good night, gents.
- Good night.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.528
- Yeah, Sal!
- Nice job, Sal.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.130
Sal:
I know I'm a great cook,

41:05.163 --> 41:06.798
but I clearly still have
things to learn.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.167
So, it stinks to be
the first one out.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.469
- Man.
- Next time.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.671
But I'm gonna keep going
after the dream

41:12.704 --> 41:14.640
to start a supper club,

41:14.673 --> 41:18.176
and this is just one step
in my very long journey.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.881
Narrator:
Next time...

41:22.914 --> 41:26.184
- Crabs!
- ( screaming )

41:26.217 --> 41:28.319
...a Gordon Ramsay
master class...

41:28.353 --> 41:30.021
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.057
- Wow.
- I have no idea
how I'm gonna do this.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.192
...leaves the top 22...

41:34.225 --> 41:35.527
- ( groans )
- Aah!

41:35.561 --> 41:36.895
...shell shocked.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.063
- And...
- This is the reason

41:38.096 --> 41:39.898
I gave you the pin.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.366
...while some home cooks
claw their way to the top...

41:41.399 --> 41:43.334
- Ah, there we go.
- ...others...

41:43.368 --> 41:45.571
- Feel like I'm gonna faint.
- ...crack under the pressure.

41:45.604 --> 41:49.174
We hate to see people
in our own apron

41:49.207 --> 41:51.209
walking out the door.
