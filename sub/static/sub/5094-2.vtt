Excuse me!

00:35.014 --> 00:36.580
I've gotten separated
from my daughter.

00:36.582 --> 00:37.881
There's a police kiosk
over by...

00:37.883 --> 00:39.516
Look, can you make
an announcement from here?

00:39.518 --> 00:41.352
She's only eight years old.
Her name is Claire!

00:41.354 --> 00:43.354
Sir, I'm sorry.
This is a ticket window.

00:43.356 --> 00:44.888
Please, you have to help us!

00:44.890 --> 00:46.423
We're not from here.

Daddy?

That's him. That's him.

All units, all units,
suspect in sight.

I love you, CC!

01:03.351 --> 01:04.666
Daddy!

01:04.668 --> 01:07.553
Wait! No! Daddy!

01:07.555 --> 01:10.439
Wow. That's pretty intense.

01:10.441 --> 01:11.557
It is, Norah.

01:11.559 --> 01:13.476
Even I'm on the edge
of my seat.

01:13.478 --> 01:17.313
You know, we decided early on
with this one to just go for it.

01:17.315 --> 01:18.647
Not pull any punches,

01:18.649 --> 01:21.450
put my character through
a living hell from scene one.

01:21.452 --> 01:24.019
There's kind of a... a Hitchcock
quality to it, right?

01:24.021 --> 01:25.905
Innocent man
wrongly pursued.

01:25.907 --> 01:27.873
That's right,
and it's... it's a great ride.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.326
And, you know,
the sacrifices that he makes

01:30.328 --> 01:32.211
to get his family whole again

01:32.213 --> 01:33.612
are ones that I think

01:33.614 --> 01:35.081
an audiences can
really relate to.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.799
Now, Norah,

01:36.801 --> 01:40.920
can we please talk
about my love life already?

01:40.922 --> 01:42.088
Oh, yeah! (laughs)
(chuckling)

01:42.090 --> 01:43.889
You brought it up,
let's talk about it.

01:43.891 --> 01:45.257
Well, you were going to.
Let's talk about it,

01:45.259 --> 01:46.926
um, because it certainly gets
a lot of attention,

01:46.928 --> 01:48.010
a lot of press.
Yeah.

01:48.012 --> 01:51.397
Can I show you
how the tabloids work?

01:51.399 --> 01:52.848
Yeah, sure.

01:55.652 --> 01:57.720
I really like your show,

01:57.722 --> 02:00.272
and I think you
are fantastic on it.

02:00.274 --> 02:02.842
Thank you.

02:02.844 --> 02:04.693
We just spent a weekend
in Cabo together

02:04.695 --> 02:05.928
and you're pregnant
with my child.

02:05.930 --> 02:07.196
(laughing):
Oh, come on.

02:07.198 --> 02:09.815
Mmm, that's how it works.
99% of the time,

02:09.817 --> 02:11.901
that's exactly how they blow it
out of proportion.

02:11.903 --> 02:14.269
Then let's talk about the
one percent that is true.

02:14.271 --> 02:16.939
Well, I think that's about
all the time we have today,

02:16.941 --> 02:18.106
ladies and gentlemen. (laughs)

02:18.108 --> 02:19.375
I'll see you at the movies.

02:19.377 --> 02:22.912
<i>Accused</i> opens in theaters
on Friday.

02:22.914 --> 02:24.046
And what's next for you?

02:24.048 --> 02:27.082
Next up is called
<i>Crime of the Century.</i>

02:27.084 --> 02:28.884
It actually-- no spoilers here--

02:28.886 --> 02:31.554
but I am trailing
an NYPD detective

02:31.556 --> 02:33.005
for the next few days.

02:33.007 --> 02:34.590
Oh.
Just getting the download.

02:34.592 --> 02:36.509
All right. Russell Berke,
always a pleasure.

02:36.511 --> 02:37.843
It is, Norah. Thank you.

02:37.845 --> 02:41.363
ARBOGAST: <i>And if you, uh, flip</i>
<i>to the next page,</i>

02:41.365 --> 02:43.115
you see a graphic
that breaks down

02:43.117 --> 02:46.552
the pattern of early retirement
based on borough, precinct,

02:46.554 --> 02:47.636
length of service, rank.

02:47.638 --> 02:49.638
Dino, just a minute.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.575
I'd like to stay
with this exit poll.

02:53.493 --> 02:56.612
You have to take it
with a grain of lt.

02:56.614 --> 02:59.281
Frank, I'd caution you not
to misinterpret those metrics.

02:59.283 --> 03:01.717
I can read, Dino.
You're saying the numbers lie?

03:01.719 --> 03:05.871
No, but if you take into account
that when a retiring cop says

03:05.873 --> 03:08.174
he didn't feel a personal
connection with the PC,

03:08.176 --> 03:10.359
it's kind of like
an assembly line worker

03:10.361 --> 03:11.927
saying he didn't feel
a personal connection

03:11.929 --> 03:13.162
with the company's president.

03:13.164 --> 03:15.581
It's not expected or assumed;
it's, uh...

03:15.583 --> 03:16.599
A non issue.

03:16.601 --> 03:18.133
I am not a president.

03:18.135 --> 03:21.470
I am a New York City cop
who was asked to be the PC,

03:21.472 --> 03:24.223
but I'm one of them.
I have to be to lead them.

03:24.225 --> 03:25.691
Actually, you don't.

03:25.693 --> 03:27.309
There's no provision
in the job profile

03:27.311 --> 03:28.394
that requires a PC

03:28.396 --> 03:30.145
to have experience on the job.

03:30.147 --> 03:33.365
But I do, and I won't lose that.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.851
What are you gonna do,
throw a barbecue for 35,000?

03:35.853 --> 03:37.286
(both chuckle)

03:40.824 --> 03:42.625
Frank, with the City Council
trying to appoint

03:42.627 --> 03:43.742
an inspector general over us...

03:43.744 --> 03:45.961
Yeah, I know, it's hardly
the time for me

03:45.963 --> 03:47.463
to go all soft and fuzzy.

03:47.465 --> 03:48.998
You have their respect, Frank.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.382
That's what matters.

03:54.471 --> 03:56.505
Okay, fine, let's move on.

04:00.376 --> 04:02.228
BAEZ: You know what
I loved you in

04:02.230 --> 04:03.095
that no one else did?

04:03.097 --> 04:04.680
(chuckling): Uh...
Um...

04:04.682 --> 04:06.298
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.385
What I meant-- it wasn't
as huge at the box office.

04:09.387 --> 04:11.153
<i>Edge of Night.</i>
Yes!

04:11.155 --> 04:15.024
It was pretty far out there,
but you were so real.

04:16.259 --> 04:17.392
Thank you.
Yeah.

04:17.394 --> 04:19.978
Seriously, Detective,
that means a lot.

04:19.981 --> 04:22.081
Hate to interrupt
the love fest, you two,

04:22.083 --> 04:23.782
but, uh, we're almost there.

04:23.784 --> 04:26.252
We're gonna be looking
for one Yoo-Hoo Clinton:

04:26.254 --> 04:29.288
male black;
18; five, six; 150.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.423
He's wanted for
questioning in a series

04:31.425 --> 04:33.042
of armed robberies
of liquor stores.

04:33.044 --> 04:34.910
You call him Yoo-Hoo
'cause he likes the drink?

04:34.912 --> 04:38.130
No. Most nicknames usually
come off of opposites.

04:38.132 --> 04:40.432
Like, a fat guy
would be "Tin""

04:40.434 --> 04:42.751
or a short guy
would be "Shaquille""

04:42.753 --> 04:44.436
Right, so then he doesn't
like Yoo-Hoo.

04:44.438 --> 04:46.522
I don't know if he
likes Yoo-Hoo or not.

04:46.524 --> 04:47.806
(laughing):
Just kidding.

04:47.808 --> 04:49.692
His name's Yousef.
I'm sure it comes from that.

04:49.694 --> 04:51.460
So how's this gonna go down?

04:51.462 --> 04:53.779
Well, you're gonna look
for my partner and I

04:53.781 --> 04:56.031
from the backseat

04:56.033 --> 04:59.118
to move in on opposite sides
of the suspect, closing in.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.986
Sort of like a pair of pliers.

05:00.988 --> 05:04.873
And... there he is.

05:10.780 --> 05:12.331
Nice 'fro, man.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.448
(laughter)

05:13.450 --> 05:14.783
(singsongy):
Yoo-Hoo!

05:14.785 --> 05:17.303
See if you can guess
which one he is.

05:18.121 --> 05:20.055
And don't leave
the car, okay?

05:30.900 --> 05:32.651
Hey.

05:50.036 --> 05:52.588
(laughter)

05:54.040 --> 05:55.007

05:55.009 --> 05:56.592

06:12.792 --> 06:15.527
Drop the gun! Hey! Drop it!

06:17.781 --> 06:19.448
Grab that, partner.

06:19.450 --> 06:20.399
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:20.401 --> 06:22.350
Huh? I told you to
stay in the car.

06:22.352 --> 06:24.370
(groaning) Yousef Clinton,
you're under arrest

06:24.372 --> 06:26.288
for criminal possession
of a weapon.

06:26.290 --> 06:28.040
That's just for
starters, jackass.

06:28.042 --> 06:30.042
Yo, Russell Berke?

06:31.978 --> 06:33.062
Yo, you Russell Berke!

06:33.064 --> 06:34.380
I got slammed
by Russell Berke!

06:34.382 --> 06:35.914
You drive,
I'll ride in the back.

06:35.916 --> 06:36.965

06:36.967 --> 06:39.134
Just as funny and nice

How you know
I was gonna ask that?

06:43.540 --> 06:46.141
Hey, maybe if you're nice,

I have a California
Medical Marijuana card.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.638
Save it.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.841
Look, this isn't gonna work out.

09:45.843 --> 09:47.609
Ah, come on, Danny.

09:47.611 --> 09:51.012
Look, you interfered
with my partner in the field,

09:51.014 --> 09:52.748
you inserted yourself
into a police action

09:52.750 --> 09:53.949
with an armed suspect,

09:53.951 --> 09:56.118
which could have gotten
you killed on my watch.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.253
Now you're carrying
high-grade weed

09:58.255 --> 09:59.921
around the police precinct.

09:59.923 --> 10:00.989
This...

10:00.991 --> 10:04.209
It won't happen again.

10:06.362 --> 10:09.781
You know, I really liked you
in that one picture

10:09.783 --> 10:12.167
where you played catch
in Fenway Park,

10:12.169 --> 10:14.669
you know, with your dad
at the end of the movie?

10:14.671 --> 10:15.871
Thanks.
It was good, yeah.

10:15.873 --> 10:18.306
I actually shed a tear myself.

10:18.308 --> 10:19.674
Went home, got my two boys,

10:19.676 --> 10:21.309
went back, saw it again
same day.

10:21.311 --> 10:22.477
Really?
Yeah.

10:22.479 --> 10:25.230
Maybe I could meet 'em
while I'm here.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.567
Here's my card.

10:28.569 --> 10:30.268
That's my cell number.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.753
You call me by 6:00 p.m. today,

10:31.755 --> 10:33.655
I'll have a few new guys
lined up for you, okay?

10:33.657 --> 10:35.490
What guys?

10:35.492 --> 10:39.778
A couple of retired detectives,
real, uh, superstars.

10:39.780 --> 10:42.197
You know, the kind of guys
with a million stories.

10:42.199 --> 10:43.882
Me, I just grind.

10:43.884 --> 10:46.001
I don't have the moves
for the silver screen.

10:46.003 --> 10:48.370
I want the real thing.

10:48.372 --> 10:49.788
No offense, but...

10:49.790 --> 10:51.089
I don't get it.

10:51.091 --> 10:53.125
You got my cell phone number.

10:53.127 --> 10:55.127
You need anything,
you give me a call.

10:55.129 --> 10:57.095
It really was an honor
to meet you.

10:57.097 --> 11:00.732
I look forward
to seeing your picture.

11:00.734 --> 11:02.601
Thanks.

11:03.719 --> 11:05.837
HENRY: <i>Well, you had</i>
<i>a lot longer honeymoon</i>

11:05.839 --> 11:07.539
<i>with the rank and file</i>
<i>than I got.</i>

11:07.541 --> 11:11.309
I had to handle the
Beaufort Committee hearings

11:11.311 --> 11:14.646
and the ticket-fixing
scandal in the 2-2

11:14.648 --> 11:16.515
before my first year was up.

11:16.517 --> 11:18.617
So how did you stay
in the flow with the men?

11:18.619 --> 11:20.652
(grunts)

11:20.654 --> 11:22.037
Little things.

11:22.039 --> 11:24.823
You know,
going to retirement parties,

11:24.825 --> 11:27.192
giving them an "attabo""
every now and then.

11:27.194 --> 11:30.962
I always feel like a wet blanket
at retirement parties,

11:30.964 --> 11:34.115
like the fun starts
after I walk out the door.

11:34.117 --> 11:35.667
And you'd be right.

11:35.669 --> 11:40.055
Being the top cop comes with
a lot of sacrifices nobody sees.

11:40.057 --> 11:43.041
You're looking for love
in the wrong place, Francis.

11:43.043 --> 11:45.343
I'm not looking for love, Pop.

11:46.145 --> 11:47.596
What, then?

11:47.598 --> 11:49.781
(sighs)

11:51.567 --> 11:54.519
Some...

11:54.521 --> 11:58.156
sense of presence
in their lives.

11:58.158 --> 12:00.325
(grunts)

12:03.162 --> 12:04.996
And sitting at home

12:04.998 --> 12:07.115
isn't going to accomplish
anything.

12:09.235 --> 12:11.553
JAMIE: <i>No, I'm not saying</i>
<i>working midnights is fun,</i>

12:11.555 --> 12:14.506
but I don't think you can call
yourself a New York City cop

12:14.508 --> 12:16.407
until you've survived a few.

12:16.409 --> 12:19.211
All right, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:19.213 --> 12:20.829
Welcome to the late, late show.

12:20.831 --> 12:22.430
(laughter)
On tonight's menu,

12:22.432 --> 12:23.965
we got a full moon

12:23.967 --> 12:25.767
and a RealFeel temperature
of about 80,

12:25.769 --> 12:28.186
and a growing pattern
of push-in robberies

12:28.188 --> 12:30.639
on 35 to 39 Streets
between 8th and 9th Avenue.

12:30.641 --> 12:32.891
Ten-hut!

12:34.026 --> 12:37.012
Sergeant, please open the ranks
for inspection.

12:37.014 --> 12:38.046
Front row,

12:38.048 --> 12:39.214
one step forward.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.399
Move.

12:48.658 --> 12:50.725
Hot out there tonight.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.060
Yes, sir.

12:52.062 --> 12:55.046
Wearing your bulletproof vest
would just make it

12:55.048 --> 12:57.165
that much more uncomfortable.
Yes, sir.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.449
Not worth the risk.

12:58.451 --> 13:00.201
No, sir.
Put it on.

13:00.203 --> 13:01.403
Yes, sir.

13:03.005 --> 13:05.040
Nice phone.
Stow it out of sight.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.359
Yes, sir.

13:09.145 --> 13:11.263
Were you eyeballing me,
Officer Janko?

13:11.265 --> 13:13.064
Sir, no, sir.

13:13.066 --> 13:14.299
This isn't the academy.

13:14.301 --> 13:15.817
One "sir" will suffice.

13:15.819 --> 13:17.302
Where's your flashlight?

13:18.137 --> 13:20.138
In my locker, sir.

13:21.107 --> 13:23.425
Not going to do you much good
from there.

13:26.445 --> 13:27.746
On your toes, Sergeant.

13:27.748 --> 13:28.947
Yes, sir.

13:33.002 --> 13:34.753
(sighs)

13:34.755 --> 13:38.039
Do good work,
come back in one piece,

13:38.041 --> 13:40.175
and thank you for your service.

13:45.681 --> 13:47.849
At ease.

13:51.554 --> 13:53.888
DISPATCH:
12 David on the air?

13:53.890 --> 13:55.307
12 David, go.

13:55.309 --> 13:56.474
12 David, be advised,

13:56.476 --> 13:59.010
you have a 10-39,
a male exposing himself

13:59.012 --> 14:02.647
at 585 West 49, apartment 508.

14:02.649 --> 14:05.483
Uh, 12 David responding.

14:13.492 --> 14:15.377
Police

14:16.362 --> 14:18.079
It's about time.

14:18.081 --> 14:19.547
Yes, ma'am.

14:19.549 --> 14:21.716
Come on in.

14:24.086 --> 14:26.388
JANKO: You called about
a flasher?

14:29.375 --> 14:31.376
The flasher, ma'am?

14:31.378 --> 14:33.011
Out the window.

14:35.147 --> 14:36.765
He was on the fire escape?

14:36.767 --> 14:38.933
No, out this window.

14:41.354 --> 14:43.271
Was he down the street?

14:43.273 --> 14:47.492
No, across the street,
four up, four across.

14:51.831 --> 14:53.665
Oh, there's your flasher.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.284
Look at him,
just waving that thing around.

14:57.753 --> 15:00.738
Um, there's no law against
him keeping his blinds up.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.042
Or you lowering yours.

15:04.044 --> 15:06.411
Um, it's a quality-of-life
crime.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.096
Not really.

15:08.098 --> 15:09.881
Okay, let's say you're
a young girl

15:09.883 --> 15:13.268
who can't sleep, either,
and she looks up to the moon

15:13.270 --> 15:15.186
to dream, and she's
suddenly traumatized

15:15.188 --> 15:17.355
by this pervert.

15:17.357 --> 15:19.107
How many times have
you called this in?

15:19.109 --> 15:20.809
A lot,

15:20.811 --> 15:22.610
and y'all haven't done anything
about it.

15:22.612 --> 15:23.928
Because we can't,

15:23.930 --> 15:25.780
so please don't waste
NYPD resources anymore.

15:27.233 --> 15:28.900
There you go.

15:28.902 --> 15:30.318
Problem solved.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.370
JAMIE:
Great.

15:32.372 --> 15:34.038
It's 100 degrees out there.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.040
Yeah.
I need my ventilation.

15:36.042 --> 15:38.910
You have a good night,
ma'am.

15:38.912 --> 15:41.079
(typing)

15:41.947 --> 15:44.165
(phone ringing)

15:44.167 --> 15:46.835
Regan.

15:46.837 --> 15:47.886
Hey, it's me, Russell.

15:47.888 --> 15:49.337
I need you to come meet me.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.122
What? Why?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.457
I got stabbed.

15:52.459 --> 15:54.259
What are you talking about,
Russell?

15:54.261 --> 15:55.844
I need you to come get me.

15:55.846 --> 15:57.429
Well, go to the hospital.

15:57.431 --> 15:59.147
I can't do that.

15:59.149 --> 16:00.798
Look, I'm asking you.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.933
Okay.

16:01.935 --> 16:03.801
Where are you?

16:03.803 --> 16:06.237
19th, 20th Street.

16:06.239 --> 16:09.257
The High Line by the river.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.608
All right, listen to me.

16:10.610 --> 16:11.860
Russ...

16:11.862 --> 16:13.194
Russell!

16:23.709 --> 16:25.911
(laughter)

16:27.113 --> 16:28.930
Hey, have you heard
from the lieutenant?

16:28.932 --> 16:30.031
Not since we turned out.

16:30.033 --> 16:31.733
I wish there was something
we could do for him.

16:31.735 --> 16:33.568
<i>We could go rob a bank.</i>

16:33.570 --> 16:35.036
(laughter)

16:36.906 --> 16:38.823
Oh, no.

16:42.745 --> 16:43.878
Good evening.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.080
ALL:
Sir.

16:45.082 --> 16:46.414
As you were.

16:48.684 --> 16:50.501
(sighs)

16:50.503 --> 16:51.636
Quiet night?

16:51.638 --> 16:54.139
We were just
reconnoitering, sir.

16:54.141 --> 16:57.208
Is the communication section down?
No, sir.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.177
Are your radios working?
Yes, sir.

16:59.179 --> 17:02.013
And you had to have
this little recon face-to-face?

17:02.015 --> 17:03.848
No, Chief, we were just...

17:03.850 --> 17:06.635
Can I see your memo book,
Officer Lee?

17:07.787 --> 17:09.854
Yes, sir.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.965
Your platoon commander
seems to give you a scratch

17:20.968 --> 17:22.884
minutes after you turn out

17:22.886 --> 17:25.753
or minutes before end of tour.

17:25.756 --> 17:27.155
Nothing in between.

17:27.156 --> 17:28.440
Not always, sir.

17:28.442 --> 17:29.441
Uh-huh.

17:29.443 --> 17:31.559
We're in radio contact, sir.

17:31.561 --> 17:34.479
Well, for instance,
you could radio in

17:34.481 --> 17:36.514
that you're patrolling
the Demarest Houses,

17:36.516 --> 17:38.516
when, in fact,
you're right here,

17:38.518 --> 17:40.735
jawboning with your buddies
by the river.

17:40.737 --> 17:41.903
Yes, sir.

17:41.905 --> 17:43.488
I mean, no, sir.

17:43.490 --> 17:44.639
We would never do that.

17:44.641 --> 17:46.541
Who's your platoon commander?

17:47.410 --> 17:49.127
Lieutenant Eastman, sir.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.368
This...

17:56.370 --> 17:59.070
chance meeting is to remain
between the six of us

17:59.072 --> 18:01.739
with no report back
to your precinct, understood?

18:01.741 --> 18:02.824
ALL:
Yes, sir.

18:02.826 --> 18:04.876
Well,

18:04.878 --> 18:07.245
it seems the rats and pigeons

18:07.247 --> 18:10.348
are safe and secure
for the night.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.883
Move on.

18:11.885 --> 18:14.135
ALL:
Yes, sir.

18:23.646 --> 18:25.430
Russell, I'm here.

18:25.432 --> 18:27.765
I'm on the corner.
Where are you?

18:27.767 --> 18:30.568
Look under the High Line,
behind some stairs.

18:32.371 --> 18:34.539
I'm coming.

18:42.381 --> 18:44.782
Where'd they get you?

18:44.784 --> 18:46.684
Geez.

18:46.686 --> 18:48.920
Can you breathe all right?

18:48.922 --> 18:50.588
Yeah.
Then hold on.

18:50.590 --> 18:52.590
(groans)
Damn it.

18:52.592 --> 18:53.791
What the hell happened?

18:53.793 --> 18:55.393
(groaning)

18:55.395 --> 18:56.928
Where's your car?

18:56.930 --> 18:58.796
Over here.
I'll take you to the hospital.

18:58.798 --> 19:01.516
I-I got a doctor waiting
on East 62nd Street.

19:01.518 --> 19:03.151
What's with the disguise?

19:03.153 --> 19:05.937
Look, sometimes I like to go
into the world anonymously.

19:05.939 --> 19:07.105
All right?

19:07.107 --> 19:08.907
Go people-watching,
like everyone else does.

19:08.909 --> 19:10.575
Yeah, and how does that
get you stabbed?

19:10.577 --> 19:14.028
I was mugged, all right, and I
don't want it out there, okay?

19:14.030 --> 19:16.081
All right.

19:20.352 --> 19:22.087
I knew Herb Eastman

19:22.089 --> 19:24.756
from working on the
pile after 9/11.

19:25.657 --> 19:28.460
Funny guy, a little flashy.

19:28.462 --> 19:31.513
Must be near retirement age.

19:31.515 --> 19:33.765
Maybe closer than he thinks.

19:39.872 --> 19:41.389
Ten-hut!

19:41.391 --> 19:44.675
As you were.

19:44.677 --> 19:46.344
Officers.

19:51.784 --> 19:53.284
As you were, Sergeant.

19:53.286 --> 19:54.903
Commissioner Reagan.

19:54.905 --> 19:57.188
So, how's it going tonight?

19:57.190 --> 19:58.907
Pretty quiet, sir.

19:58.909 --> 20:01.893
I'll take that all night long.

20:01.895 --> 20:03.027
Yes, sir.

20:03.029 --> 20:05.363
I'd like to speak
to Lieutenant Eastman.

20:06.215 --> 20:08.283
He's out on a job, sir.

20:08.285 --> 20:11.102
Oh. Is he still at the scene?

20:11.104 --> 20:12.703
I believe so.

20:12.705 --> 20:14.255
What's the address?

20:16.475 --> 20:19.210
1404 Avenue C, sir.

20:19.212 --> 20:20.845
Thank you, Sergeant.

20:20.847 --> 20:22.814
Carry on.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.938
DANNY: I got Russell Berke
out here.

20:29.940 --> 20:32.023
Come on.

20:32.025 --> 20:33.191
I'm Detective Reagan.

20:33.193 --> 20:34.392
Please, come in.

20:38.914 --> 20:40.064
(groaning)

20:40.066 --> 20:41.933
Is this a police matter?

20:41.935 --> 20:43.368
Not officially.
Look, somebody cut him.

20:43.370 --> 20:45.587
I need you to patch him up
and then tell me what you can

20:45.589 --> 20:47.238
about the weapon
that was used to do it.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.840
Of course.

20:48.842 --> 20:50.408
It's an honor, Mr. Berke.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.627
Sorry for the circumstances.

20:52.629 --> 20:53.678
Please.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.381
Appreciate you doing this.
Yeah.

20:56.383 --> 20:57.882
Where to, boss?

20:57.884 --> 21:00.435
Crime scene,
1404 Avenue C.

21:00.437 --> 21:02.554
Sir, that can't be right.

21:02.556 --> 21:04.088
Why not?

21:04.090 --> 21:07.175
That address,
that's a cop bar called Finest.

21:07.177 --> 21:09.110
My cousin Sal's a part owner.

21:09.112 --> 21:13.031
(sighs)

21:13.033 --> 21:16.201
Let's head over.

21:19.572 --> 21:21.789
You'll let me know
if you find anything, huh, Doc?

21:21.791 --> 21:23.041
First thing, Detective.

21:23.043 --> 21:25.326
All right. I'll leave
my card on your desk.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.970
(beeps)

21:39.775 --> 21:41.309
Let me go in there.

21:41.311 --> 21:42.594
We go in together.

21:42.596 --> 21:44.429
If he's there drinking
at the bar,

21:44.431 --> 21:46.097
I'll ask him outside.
What if he's not?

21:46.099 --> 21:48.233
Odds are, he's already
been given a heads-up,

21:48.235 --> 21:50.101
and you're gonna walk
in looking a day late

21:50.103 --> 21:52.470
and a dollar short in front
of a barroom full of cops.

21:52.472 --> 21:53.521
And that'd be okay.

21:53.523 --> 21:54.973
How is that?

21:54.975 --> 21:56.991
What else is this for, Dino?

21:58.644 --> 22:00.995
So what if I get a little egg
on my face?

22:00.997 --> 22:02.997
More's the better.

22:02.999 --> 22:06.034
If the rank and file
isn't feeling a connection,

22:06.036 --> 22:08.202
maybe it's because
the streets I walk down

22:08.204 --> 22:09.954
are always swept and secured.

22:09.956 --> 22:11.456
I'm the guy in the tower.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.258
I'm the guy in front of the mic

22:13.260 --> 22:14.509
with all the right answers,

22:14.511 --> 22:16.494
all vetted and prepped.
(phone ringing)

22:16.496 --> 22:18.379
Nuciforo.

22:18.381 --> 22:19.764
Where?

22:22.434 --> 22:24.385
Got it. Thank you.

22:24.387 --> 22:27.305
Boss, we got a homicide
in the West Village.

22:27.307 --> 22:29.006
Tourist had
his throat slashed.

22:29.008 --> 22:30.725
They're still establishing
the crime scene.

22:30.727 --> 22:33.177
We should head down there.
We can come back here after.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.696
I know.
Light it up, Jim.

22:34.698 --> 22:36.614
Got it, boss.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.700
(siren wailing)

22:44.523 --> 22:45.856
Hey.

22:45.858 --> 22:46.824
Sorry you waited.

22:46.826 --> 22:48.025
I had Doc
call me a car.

22:48.027 --> 22:49.077
Uh-huh.

22:49.079 --> 22:51.145
Wound's not so bad.
I'm good to go.

22:51.147 --> 22:52.113
Right.

22:52.115 --> 22:53.915
You had Doc
call you a car

22:53.917 --> 22:55.866
on account of you got
your phone snatched

22:55.868 --> 22:57.619
in the, uh,
mugging, right?

22:57.621 --> 22:59.721
Uh... yeah,
I don't know.

22:59.723 --> 23:01.889
Uh... (clears throat)
I guess.

23:02.725 --> 23:05.393
Only, uh... you didn't.

23:08.063 --> 23:09.230
You looked through
my phone?

23:09.232 --> 23:11.549
Yeah, I did.

23:11.551 --> 23:13.434
Though I had to have
one of the techs

23:13.436 --> 23:16.904
walk me through what the
Tryster app is, Russell.

23:18.223 --> 23:19.774
Now you know.
(clears throat)

23:20.609 --> 23:21.809
Talk about unsafe sex.

23:21.811 --> 23:23.728
(laughs)

23:23.730 --> 23:25.062
Danny, it's research.

23:25.064 --> 23:26.447
Oh, research.

23:26.449 --> 23:28.616
So you actually
think I'm gonna buy

23:28.618 --> 23:29.951
that the detective
you're playing

23:29.953 --> 23:32.120
is secretly gay and trolls
around the city at night

23:32.122 --> 23:33.037
looking for, uh,

23:33.039 --> 23:34.756
anonymous sex?
Is that it?

23:34.758 --> 23:35.923
I don't expect you
to believe anything.

23:35.925 --> 23:36.924
Can we just...?

23:36.926 --> 23:39.243
No, actually, we can't.

23:39.245 --> 23:40.928
'Cause about
40 minutes ago,

23:40.930 --> 23:42.547
a white male from
Gary, Indiana

23:42.549 --> 23:44.449
was found stabbed and
with his throat slashed

23:44.451 --> 23:45.516
in a park on
Christopher Street.

23:45.518 --> 23:46.467
I don't know
anything about that.

23:46.469 --> 23:48.219
He had his pants
around his ankles,

23:48.221 --> 23:50.438
and the Tryster app
was open on his phone.

23:51.273 --> 23:52.940
Sound familiar?

23:52.942 --> 23:55.643
Look... there is
a predator loose

23:55.645 --> 23:57.145
on the streets
of this city.

23:57.147 --> 23:58.396
You're gonna
help me find him.

23:58.398 --> 24:00.765
I can't.
Sure you can.

24:02.868 --> 24:03.818
I really can't.

24:03.820 --> 24:05.703
No, actually, you can.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.539
Look, I have a right
to keep my private life private.

24:08.541 --> 24:10.241
Come on, Russell,
I don't give a damn

24:10.243 --> 24:13.995
if you like men or women
or cream-filled donuts, okay?

24:13.997 --> 24:15.580
It's 2013.

24:15.582 --> 24:16.947
Men marry each other
all the time.

24:16.949 --> 24:18.449
They put it in the papers,
for goodness' sake.

24:18.451 --> 24:21.636
Well, in my world, it's 1913,
and they don't hire fairies

24:21.638 --> 24:24.806
to star in the moving pictures,
especially the kind I make.

24:26.124 --> 24:27.475
You can't drag me
into this.

24:27.477 --> 24:28.426
Actually, I can.

24:28.428 --> 24:29.761
Because when
you called me,

24:29.763 --> 24:31.813
you dragged me
into a crime.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.314
Which means I'm bound
to report it

24:33.316 --> 24:34.632
and derelict
if I don't.

24:34.634 --> 24:37.185
So now we both have
a secret, Russell.

24:41.323 --> 24:42.824
I'm begging you, man.

24:42.826 --> 24:44.242
I have no interest

24:44.244 --> 24:47.745
in letting your cat
out of the bag.

24:47.747 --> 24:50.481
I need you to help me.

24:50.483 --> 24:53.067
You help me,
I'll help you.

24:53.069 --> 24:54.919
You got my word on that.

25:00.759 --> 25:02.376
All right.

25:14.527 --> 25:17.144
Cheekbones higher,
more pronounced.

25:21.199 --> 25:23.751
HIRO:
Like that?

25:24.786 --> 25:26.203
Yep. Looks good.

25:26.205 --> 25:27.922
Anything else?

25:33.261 --> 25:34.228
Okay...

25:34.230 --> 25:36.046
He, um...

25:36.048 --> 25:37.515
he might have, like, a cut

25:37.517 --> 25:40.834
or a bandage
over his right eye.

25:40.836 --> 25:43.037
Like he got hit
with something.

25:44.523 --> 25:45.723
There you go.

25:48.693 --> 25:50.010
That looks like our guy.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.429
E-mail it over to me, okay?

25:51.431 --> 25:52.980
Thanks for
staying up late.

25:52.982 --> 25:54.615
Get some, uh, sleep.

25:54.617 --> 25:56.233
No worries, Danny.

25:56.235 --> 25:58.402
(sighs)

25:59.287 --> 26:00.988
There's your guy.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.157
I'm gonna need
your watch for the lab.

26:03.159 --> 26:06.193
You might have got some hairs
or skin on it when you hit him.

26:06.195 --> 26:08.212
Uh, it's inscribed.

26:08.214 --> 26:09.163
So what?

26:09.165 --> 26:10.247
"To Russell,

26:10.249 --> 26:11.632
from your
Paramount Pictures family."

26:11.634 --> 26:12.883
Where my deal is.
Oh.

26:12.885 --> 26:15.052
Yeah. That's a problem.

26:17.139 --> 26:18.923
I got an idea.
Let me see.

26:26.097 --> 26:27.314
Wait, d...

26:27.316 --> 26:29.266
What?
Nothing. It's nothing.

26:31.269 --> 26:32.319
There you go.

26:32.321 --> 26:34.071
Problem solved.

26:34.073 --> 26:36.223
(cell phone chimes)
Oh.

26:36.225 --> 26:38.242
We got a match.

26:38.244 --> 26:39.944
The, uh, Tryster handle

26:39.946 --> 26:41.612
that they pulled
off the vic's phone.

26:41.614 --> 26:43.447
STR8ARROW,
spelled with an "8,"

26:43.449 --> 26:45.599
same as the guy
who stabbed you.

26:45.601 --> 26:47.651
You're doing good,
Hollywood.

26:47.653 --> 26:49.069
Very good.

26:49.071 --> 26:50.104
Leave the watch.

26:50.106 --> 26:51.856
Let's get you back
to your hotel.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.595
NICKY: <i>Come on, Uncle Danny,</i>
<i>give it up.</i>

26:57.597 --> 26:58.879
Give what up?

26:58.881 --> 27:00.664
You know what.
The scoop.

27:00.666 --> 27:01.799
What scoop?

27:01.801 --> 27:04.268
He was out half
the night with him.

27:04.270 --> 27:05.219
What's he really like?

27:05.221 --> 27:07.004
Whoa, who are we
talking about here?

27:07.006 --> 27:09.273
Russell Berke, the actor.

27:09.275 --> 27:11.609
He's riding with Danny,
doing research.

27:12.227 --> 27:13.210
What's he been in?

27:13.212 --> 27:14.678
Oh, come on!

27:14.680 --> 27:15.779
Oh, seriously, Pop?

27:15.781 --> 27:16.897
What?

27:16.899 --> 27:17.931
What's he like?

27:17.933 --> 27:19.266
You met him.

27:19.268 --> 27:20.484
What you see
is what you get.

27:20.486 --> 27:23.137
Well, I would like
to take one, please.

27:23.139 --> 27:25.105
(laughter)

27:25.107 --> 27:26.106
Mom. Inappropriate.

27:26.108 --> 27:28.409
Very inappropriate.

27:28.411 --> 27:30.144
I actually feel
bad for the guy.

27:30.146 --> 27:31.795
Oh, really?
I'm serious.

27:31.797 --> 27:33.414
If the guy wants
any kind of privacy,

27:33.416 --> 27:35.115
he's got to move around
like a wanted man.

27:35.117 --> 27:36.417
Well, he is wanted.

27:36.419 --> 27:37.451
I want him,
Linda wants him,

27:37.453 --> 27:38.502
everyone I know...
Mom!

27:38.504 --> 27:39.887
ERIN:
What?

27:39.889 --> 27:42.172
Aunt Erin is joking.

27:42.174 --> 27:44.091
I hope so.

27:44.093 --> 27:45.392
What's the name
of that actor

27:45.394 --> 27:47.161
that was in that movie,
um, <i>Full Metal Jacket?</i>

27:47.163 --> 27:48.145
The drill instructor.

27:48.147 --> 27:49.330
R. Lee Ermey.

27:49.332 --> 27:50.631
Yeah. Dad was
kind of like him

27:50.633 --> 27:52.149
when he came in
the precinct the other day.

27:52.151 --> 27:53.551
I was not.

27:53.553 --> 27:56.086
Okay, I'm exaggerating
this much.

27:56.088 --> 27:57.655
Little respect, please.

27:57.657 --> 27:59.523
Sir, yes, sir.

27:59.525 --> 28:01.358
What were you doing
in Jamie's precinct?

28:01.360 --> 28:03.944
Well, now and again,
I think it's a good idea

28:03.946 --> 28:06.096
for the PC to go out
in the field unannounced.

28:06.098 --> 28:07.531
Oh, like a sneak attack?

28:07.533 --> 28:09.316
Well, to see first-hand

28:09.318 --> 28:11.585
what's often communicated
third- or fourth-hand.

28:11.587 --> 28:13.704
When Teddy Roosevelt
was top cop,

28:13.706 --> 28:15.105
he used to walk the streets

28:15.107 --> 28:17.007
on the graveyard shift,

28:17.009 --> 28:18.492
checking on the men
on their tours.

28:18.494 --> 28:19.843
He didn't always
like what he found,

28:19.845 --> 28:22.096
but at least he saw the value
in seeing it, anyway.

28:22.098 --> 28:23.714
Did you used to do that?

28:23.716 --> 28:25.499
Sure I did.

28:25.501 --> 28:28.001
Any PC worth his salt
has got to give the troops

28:28.003 --> 28:29.836
a little show of force
now and again.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.555
Whether they
like it or not.

28:31.557 --> 28:34.875
Whether he likes it or not.

28:34.877 --> 28:36.810
So it's kind of like
when the principal

28:36.812 --> 28:38.228
decides to sit
in on class?

28:38.230 --> 28:41.398
It kind of felt that way, Jack.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.952
But, as a great New Yorker
famously said,

28:44.954 --> 28:46.870
80% of life is just showing up.

28:47.989 --> 28:50.374
DANNY:
<i>I want in, Sarge.</i>

28:50.376 --> 28:51.625
Why?

28:51.627 --> 28:53.460
Well, because the...
the witness

28:53.462 --> 28:55.879
who generated the sketch
of the suspect, he's...

28:55.881 --> 28:58.065
well, he's kind of
a CI of mine.

28:58.067 --> 28:59.783
Kind of?
How so?

28:59.785 --> 29:02.169
High-profile
lady-killer by day,

29:02.171 --> 29:03.587
way in the closet
by night.

29:03.589 --> 29:04.755
Huh.

29:04.757 --> 29:05.806
High-profile, how?

29:05.808 --> 29:07.474
That's confidential, Sarge.

29:10.729 --> 29:11.712
Get out of here.

29:11.714 --> 29:12.946
What?

29:12.948 --> 29:14.064
Russell Berke?

29:14.066 --> 29:15.683
No.

29:15.685 --> 29:17.884
What... no,
not Russell Berke!

29:17.886 --> 29:19.886
What's the matter with you?
Nothing!

29:19.888 --> 29:21.188
He comes in here,
you say you're

29:21.190 --> 29:22.906
a big fan of his,
and now look at you.

29:22.908 --> 29:24.908
I am, but you don't got
to be so mysterious.

29:24.910 --> 29:26.026
Not being mysterious, Sarge.

29:26.028 --> 29:27.494
Look, if my guy is willing,

29:27.496 --> 29:29.697
I'd like to work one
of the stakeouts with him.

29:29.699 --> 29:31.865
Uh, I don't think
it's a great idea.

29:31.867 --> 29:34.368
He's the one person
we know of who's living

29:34.370 --> 29:35.869
who could finger the perp.

29:35.871 --> 29:37.221
"Finger the perp"?

29:37.223 --> 29:38.505
(laughing)

29:39.958 --> 29:41.074
You're better than that.

29:41.076 --> 29:43.510
Who died and made you
Ellen DeGeneres?

29:43.512 --> 29:45.129
Some hick from Gary, Indiana

29:45.131 --> 29:47.381
who thought we ran
a safe and tolerant city.

29:47.383 --> 29:48.382
For everybody.

29:48.384 --> 29:49.350
Right.

29:49.352 --> 29:50.634
Yeah. Look, Sarge,

29:50.636 --> 29:52.469
if I can convince this guy
to come with,

29:52.471 --> 29:54.755
I think he'd be gold
as part of the decoy unit.

29:54.757 --> 29:57.307
I don't know. I...
Come on, make a few calls.

29:57.309 --> 29:58.776
Come on.

30:00.278 --> 30:02.446
Unbelievable.

30:17.712 --> 30:18.862
Who goes?

30:18.864 --> 30:21.014
What are you doing
in here on a Sunday night?

30:21.016 --> 30:22.966
I could ask you the same thing.

30:22.968 --> 30:23.967
I asked you first.

30:23.969 --> 30:25.052
I outrank you.

30:25.054 --> 30:26.887
We're going to release
a statement

30:26.889 --> 30:28.622
on the Village murder
first thing in the morning,

30:28.624 --> 30:30.174
and I wanted
to line up

30:30.176 --> 30:31.959
some positive metrics
on the safety

30:31.961 --> 30:33.727
of the gay community
in our city.

30:33.729 --> 30:35.996
Which brings us to... and you?

30:42.187 --> 30:44.471
I'm looking for an honest man.

30:46.641 --> 30:47.974
Another midnight ride?

30:47.976 --> 30:50.477
Yes.

30:50.479 --> 30:53.580
This is still
about Lieutenant Eastman?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.818
It's about the fact

30:57.820 --> 30:59.787
that I have to root out
the bad apples

30:59.789 --> 31:01.872
with the same pride
and sense of purpose

31:01.874 --> 31:04.007
that I hang medals
on the good ones.

31:04.009 --> 31:07.661
There's a fine line
between purpose and obsession.

31:09.564 --> 31:10.931
I'll watch for it.

31:13.852 --> 31:15.252
Good night, Garrett.

31:17.522 --> 31:20.173
Good night, boss.

31:28.533 --> 31:29.867
Come on, Russell,

31:29.869 --> 31:31.151
you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

31:31.153 --> 31:32.486
Your reputation.

31:32.488 --> 31:34.988
Like when Letterman says,
"What does Russell Berke call

31:34.990 --> 31:36.623
the Victoria's Secret
catalogue?"

31:36.625 --> 31:37.691
Match.com.

31:37.693 --> 31:40.244
Exactly.
So?

31:40.246 --> 31:42.329
So... what is that?

31:42.331 --> 31:44.581
That's just a big smokescreen?
What?

31:44.583 --> 31:46.199
Do you like pizza?

31:46.201 --> 31:48.001
Yeah, I like pizza.

31:48.003 --> 31:50.003
You like steak?
Yes, I like steak.

31:50.005 --> 31:51.672
Anybody tell you
you can't like both?

31:51.674 --> 31:53.173
Come on.

31:53.175 --> 31:54.424
That's pretty glib,
don't you think?

31:54.426 --> 31:55.893
(laughing):
What are you, my shrink?

31:55.895 --> 31:57.594
No. Thank goodness.

31:57.596 --> 31:59.480
Listen, Danny.

31:59.482 --> 32:02.483
(clears throat)
Everybody's got three lives:

32:02.485 --> 32:05.269
public, private and secret.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.904
Now, you're a New York City
detective.

32:06.906 --> 32:08.188
You must see that

32:08.190 --> 32:09.273
every day here.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.858
Sure, I see a lot of secrets, yeah.
Yeah.

32:10.860 --> 32:12.392
Even you. You got three.
No.

32:12.394 --> 32:13.443
.
Yes, you do.

32:13.445 --> 32:14.495
That's where it's different. No.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.413
What you see with me
is what you get.

32:18.116 --> 32:19.750
Well, then,
your life must be easy.

32:20.568 --> 32:22.035
You'd last about an hour.

32:22.037 --> 32:24.922
You'll try to spot him by sight
<i>and with the Tryster app</i>

32:24.924 --> 32:26.623
<i>in case he's on that,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

32:26.625 --> 32:28.842
But you're to stay in
my sights at all times.

32:28.844 --> 32:29.910
You understand?

32:29.912 --> 32:31.261
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to give me

32:31.263 --> 32:33.180
a little bit of distance if you
want my help spotting him.

32:33.182 --> 32:35.265
I mean, if he's even here.
Why?

32:35.267 --> 32:38.468
I'm the one with the expertise
in this particular area.

32:38.470 --> 32:41.805
And I would make you for a cop
from a half a mile away.

32:42.941 --> 32:44.274
Point taken.

32:44.276 --> 32:46.777
But you're to stay in sight
and on your cell phone.

32:47.612 --> 32:49.563
All right.

32:49.565 --> 32:50.764
Be careful.

33:04.245 --> 33:06.613
As you were, Sergeant.

33:06.615 --> 33:08.549
Thank you, sir.

33:10.885 --> 33:12.986
Lieutenant Eastman.

33:12.988 --> 33:15.572
He banged in sick, sir.

33:15.574 --> 33:17.758
(sighs)

33:17.760 --> 33:20.894
Did you call his residence
to verify he was present?

33:20.896 --> 33:21.895
Sir?

33:21.897 --> 33:23.931
It is standard
department procedure

33:23.933 --> 33:27.467
to see if he is,
in fact, home sick.

33:28.419 --> 33:32.155
Yes, sir, but he's
our lieutenant.

33:33.191 --> 33:36.343
One with a somewhat
mysterious geography lately.

33:36.345 --> 33:37.861
I'll call down
to the medical division...

33:37.863 --> 33:40.814
No need.

33:40.816 --> 33:43.000
I'll check on him myself.

33:48.990 --> 33:51.291
DISPATCH:
12 David on the air.

33:51.293 --> 33:53.176
12 David go.

33:53.178 --> 33:55.996
12 David, be advised
you have a 10-39,

33:55.998 --> 33:59.132
male exposing himself
at 585 West 49,

33:59.134 --> 34:00.834
apartment five boy.

34:00.836 --> 34:02.052
Three nights in a row?

34:02.054 --> 34:04.771
Can't we just write her
a summons?

34:04.773 --> 34:06.189
12 David on the air?

34:06.191 --> 34:07.674
I want to try something.

34:07.676 --> 34:09.893
Uh, 12 David responding.

34:12.030 --> 34:14.614
Russell, this is
the second time I called you.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.550
Answer the damn phone.

34:16.552 --> 34:18.235
(phone rings)

34:18.237 --> 34:19.518
What do you got, Sarge?

34:19.521 --> 34:21.638
They picked up a suspect
in Central Park.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.290
You're kidding me. You got him?

34:23.292 --> 34:24.458
They're booking him now.

34:24.460 --> 34:25.475
Yeah, we'll pack up shop

34:25.476 --> 34:26.827
and head back to the office now.

34:26.829 --> 34:29.079
Good.
All right, great.

34:33.868 --> 34:35.368
Russell.

34:35.370 --> 34:36.803
I'm here.

34:36.804 --> 34:38.804
We got the guy--
a decoy unit grabbed him

34:38.806 --> 34:39.840
in Central Park.
We're done here.

34:39.842 --> 34:41.074
No, we're not.

34:41.076 --> 34:42.225
What are you talking about?

34:42.226 --> 34:43.226
He's here.

34:43.228 --> 34:45.078
I'm staring right at him.

34:47.281 --> 34:49.766
Russell, we got the guy,
I'm telling you.

34:49.768 --> 34:51.384
No, it's the wrong guy.

34:51.386 --> 34:53.070
He practically walked
right past me.

34:53.072 --> 34:54.821
I followed him.

34:54.822 --> 34:55.906
Where are you?

34:55.908 --> 34:57.908
I-I don't know. I...

34:57.910 --> 34:59.509
I got a pool right
in front of me, and...

34:59.511 --> 35:02.746
some old army guy statue
behind me.

35:02.748 --> 35:04.581
Stay where you are.

35:16.617 --> 35:18.951
I can't find you, Russell.

35:18.953 --> 35:20.202
Look for another landmark.

35:20.204 --> 35:21.470
Take a look around.

35:23.690 --> 35:24.890
He's picked up a guy.

35:24.892 --> 35:26.475
Hey, hey. Do not move.

35:26.477 --> 35:28.177
And what-- lose him?

35:30.147 --> 35:32.214
I'm heading straight
for that building

35:32.216 --> 35:33.699
that looks like a triangle.

35:38.371 --> 35:41.507
Yeah, I see it, I see it.

35:42.509 --> 35:43.843
(knocking)

35:43.845 --> 35:46.044
Ms. Davis, police.

35:49.383 --> 35:50.282
It's about time.

35:50.284 --> 35:51.600
It's about time
you stopped

35:51.602 --> 35:52.818
wasting our time.

35:52.820 --> 35:54.904
Mmm. Well, maybe if you were
a little more responsive

35:54.906 --> 35:56.221
to complaining citizens...

35:56.223 --> 35:58.074
Put a sock in it.

35:58.076 --> 35:59.742
Hey, you're not allowed
to talk to me like that.

35:59.744 --> 36:01.577
I just did. Officer Janko?

36:01.579 --> 36:04.080
Ms. Davis, this
is Gus Galanis,

36:04.082 --> 36:06.832
your flasher.

36:09.753 --> 36:11.704
I see you got drapes.

36:11.706 --> 36:12.905
I see you got clothes.

36:12.907 --> 36:14.840
Mr. Galanis has
generously agreed to try

36:14.842 --> 36:16.742
to work things out
between the two of you.

36:16.744 --> 36:18.010
One more call,
and you'll owe the city

36:18.012 --> 36:19.044
a reimbursement
for the response.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.045
Do you understand?

36:20.047 --> 36:21.580
I understand.

36:21.582 --> 36:22.965
Good.

36:22.967 --> 36:26.302
Central, 12 David,
situation corrected, 10-91.

36:26.304 --> 36:27.803
I got red wine.

36:27.805 --> 36:29.555
I got white wine.

36:33.593 --> 36:34.944
Whatever's cold.

36:36.429 --> 36:38.114
I'm on a walkway, I don't know,

36:38.116 --> 36:40.783
probably 30 yards
past that pool.

36:40.785 --> 36:42.985
I see it.

36:44.437 --> 36:47.623
Russell, I told you to stay put.

36:50.243 --> 36:51.577
God, they must have...

36:51.579 --> 36:52.828
(both grunting)

36:52.830 --> 36:54.630
Russell!

37:00.620 --> 37:02.171
Came back for more?

37:02.173 --> 37:04.507
You like it rough?

37:04.509 --> 37:05.624
We'll get rough.

37:05.626 --> 37:07.793
(both grunting)

37:12.465 --> 37:14.316
No!

37:16.136 --> 37:17.686
(groans)

37:17.688 --> 37:20.439
Step aside. Step aside, Russell.

37:23.076 --> 37:24.076
Ow!

37:24.078 --> 37:25.828
Shut up!

37:30.834 --> 37:32.168
It's Detective Reagan.

37:32.170 --> 37:34.152
I got one under
in Madison Square Park.

37:34.154 --> 37:36.455
I need a 10-85
and a bus forthwith

37:36.457 --> 37:39.925
re: perp shot at this location.

37:39.927 --> 37:41.126
Hey.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.261
You sure this is the guy?

37:42.263 --> 37:43.612
Yeah.
All right.

37:43.614 --> 37:44.830
You hurt?

37:46.550 --> 37:48.968
Good. Get the hell out of here.

37:48.970 --> 37:50.636
Seriously?

37:50.638 --> 37:52.104
The victim fled on foot.

37:52.106 --> 37:53.889
That's what happened, okay?
Now, go.

37:53.891 --> 37:56.308
You don't need me?
You don't need me to...?

37:56.310 --> 37:58.444
This place is gonna be crawling
in a few minutes, all right?

37:58.446 --> 38:00.813
Do yourself a favor
and get the hell out of here.

38:01.648 --> 38:03.482
You know what?

38:03.484 --> 38:05.618
You're not just some grind.

38:05.620 --> 38:07.185
You're a real character.

38:08.788 --> 38:10.406
Say good-bye, Hollywood.

38:10.408 --> 38:12.691
Thanks, Detective.
(sirens blaring in distance)

38:35.015 --> 38:36.732
Lieutenant.

38:36.734 --> 38:39.551
Commissioner.

38:39.553 --> 38:42.071
Please, come in.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.731
Been a while, Herb.

38:52.733 --> 38:56.535
Yeah, it has, Frank.

38:56.537 --> 39:00.256
I can't say I was
exactly expecting you.

39:02.876 --> 39:05.327
Somehow I'm not surprised.

39:06.963 --> 39:09.782
So, what's got you home sick?

39:36.876 --> 39:39.578
ALS.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.747
Lou Gehrig's disease.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.836
I'm so sorry.

39:47.838 --> 39:51.289
The hell of it is,
she isn't even a Yankee fan.

39:53.393 --> 39:55.094
Can she hear us?

39:55.096 --> 39:56.178
No, no.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.913
Not... not from here.

40:03.486 --> 40:04.803
Beth, right?

40:04.805 --> 40:07.239
Yeah. Yeah.

40:23.256 --> 40:26.959
Frank Reagan, Beth.

40:26.961 --> 40:28.594
Just came by to
pay my respects

40:28.596 --> 40:30.295
to you and Herb.

40:43.476 --> 40:47.012
How long?

40:47.014 --> 40:48.981
Just a matter
of days.

40:52.952 --> 40:56.805
So you scratch
their memo books early and late

40:56.807 --> 40:59.208
so you can get
back here with Beth.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.994
Yes.

41:01.996 --> 41:04.029
I had my radio with me.

41:04.031 --> 41:06.582
And you weren't drinking
at a cop bar.

41:06.584 --> 41:11.053
You were working it
from behind the stick.

41:11.055 --> 41:13.372
Because of the cost of this.

41:20.063 --> 41:23.132
Your men stuck
their necks out for you.

41:25.151 --> 41:26.402
Looking out for you.

41:26.404 --> 41:28.087
That says a hell of a lot.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.284
Good night, Herb.

41:42.286 --> 41:44.236
Good night, Frank.

41:44.238 --> 41:45.671
