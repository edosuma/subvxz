WEBVTT

00:03.132 --> 00:04.432
That is Lucien Fiori.

00:04.932 --> 00:07.912
He's a Corsican national and
he escaped three hours ago,

00:08.192 --> 00:11.552
taking with him as a hostage
his court-appointed therapist.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.512
He was not acting alone.

00:14.872 --> 00:17.752
Dusek, the bomber, never been
linked with the Radik's before,

00:17.872 --> 00:19.512
but he is a Hungarian anarchist.

00:19.872 --> 00:21.552
Safecracker Victor Casta,

00:21.992 --> 00:23.672
first crime he served time for,

00:23.792 --> 00:25.752
robbery of a jewelry wholesaler in Prague.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.552
This feels more like an amateur

00:29.752 --> 00:32.592
smash-and-grab gone wrong than
a proper, professional heist.

00:32.792 --> 00:34.392
They're moving with the best safecracker

00:34.472 --> 00:36.112
in the EU and they don't touch the safe?

00:36.232 --> 00:39.872
You can rest assured that
Sebastian's mythical Swiss hacker

00:40.272 --> 00:41.952
is as real as they come.

00:42.072 --> 00:44.192
I probably need more time than I thought.

00:44.352 --> 00:45.752
I'm kind of chasing a ghost.

00:46.032 --> 00:49.112
Did anyone identify the
last robber? The tiger?

00:49.232 --> 00:50.872
The tiger was Colin, Tommy's brother.

00:51.032 --> 00:52.912
- Dr. Clark?
- Yes?

00:53.352 --> 00:54.352
We're the police.

00:55.112 --> 00:57.512
The Major says that you do
not want to go to the hospital.

00:57.672 --> 01:00.072
I have access to a villa
just outside of Lyons.

01:00.272 --> 01:02.112
I'd just like to be in
familiar surroundings.

01:02.272 --> 01:04.831
I feel like that's the best way
to begin healing from the trauma.

01:04.912 --> 01:05.632
Eva?

01:05.752 --> 01:07.432
Tommy, I need you to come here.

01:07.632 --> 01:08.752
Someone sent me a note.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.432
He wants to meet me today,

01:10.552 --> 01:13.232
but he told me to be
alone. I need someone here.

01:21.512 --> 01:22.512
Tommy!

01:22.872 --> 01:23.872
Damn! Tommy!

01:24.432 --> 01:25.432
Tommy!

01:26.032 --> 01:27.552
Stay with me. Tommy!

01:29.392 --> 01:31.192
Stay with me. Shit!

01:39.232 --> 01:41.112
Arabela, we're on the way to see Dr. Clark.

01:41.232 --> 01:43.392
Major! We need help! Now!

01:43.792 --> 01:46.232
Tommy's been shot in the head.
We're behind the jewelry store.

01:46.472 --> 01:47.872
We need help, now. Please.

01:48.032 --> 01:50.112
Hurry up. I need an
ambulance and back up, now.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.512
Stay with me.

01:54.192 --> 01:55.392
What's going on? What's wrong?

01:55.832 --> 01:57.992
It's Tommy. He's been shot.

01:59.512 --> 02:00.672
This is Major Daniel.

02:01.032 --> 02:03.752
Track Arabela's cell phone
and send ambulance and back up.

02:05.272 --> 02:06.872
Eva, come on. Come on.

02:07.912 --> 02:10.512
Eva! Eva is not answering.

02:10.952 --> 02:13.008
Do you know what it is that
she's doing? Where is she?

02:13.032 --> 02:14.192
She would not tell me, but...

02:14.672 --> 02:16.472
I need her here. I need everyone here.

02:16.592 --> 02:17.592
Yeah, all right.

02:17.832 --> 02:18.912
Stay with me, Tommy.

02:25.672 --> 02:28.272
It's okay. It's the police. Go back inside.

02:36.472 --> 02:37.512
We're here!

02:38.552 --> 02:39.832
Help is coming, they're coming.

02:41.152 --> 02:42.152
They're here.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.312 --> 03:28.032
How is he?

03:28.152 --> 03:30.632
He's, um, his head is bleeding, Major.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.872
I, um... I don't know.

03:49.392 --> 03:51.152
We got a lot to talk about.

03:55.872 --> 03:56.872
Nothing yet?

03:57.152 --> 03:58.152
No change.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.432
- I'll take over.
- All right.

04:17.112 --> 04:18.872
You sure you don't need
that to be looked at?

04:20.471 --> 04:24.312
All I did was scream "help,"
Hickman. I didn't really participate.

04:26.752 --> 04:28.008
You'd be surprised how many times

04:28.032 --> 04:30.272
someone in that situation
forgets to call for help.

04:31.152 --> 04:33.072
Or they're so panicked
that when they do call in,

04:33.112 --> 04:35.032
nobody can understand
what they're talking about.

04:35.392 --> 04:36.392
Trust me,

04:37.832 --> 04:39.032
you did real good.

04:39.952 --> 04:40.952
Okay.

04:41.672 --> 04:42.832
Then I'm a hero.

04:44.312 --> 04:45.312
You don't think so?

04:47.112 --> 04:49.392
You managed to call Louis while under fire,

04:49.512 --> 04:51.712
and get both of you out of that situation.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.432
First, we were no longer under fire.

04:57.032 --> 04:59.152
Second, I only called the Major

04:59.272 --> 05:01.952
because I couldn't remember how
to call the police in Marseille,

05:02.072 --> 05:05.072
and third, we didn't
exactly come out unscathed.

05:05.352 --> 05:06.472
But you're both alive.

05:06.632 --> 05:08.112
Only one of us is conscious.

05:08.472 --> 05:10.032
So you're determined then?

05:10.992 --> 05:11.992
Determined?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.672
To blame yourself for
something you have no fault in.

05:17.312 --> 05:18.312
I just...

05:20.552 --> 05:22.192
I wish I could have done something more.

05:22.392 --> 05:24.752
Every cop would rather be
the one who takes the shot

05:25.312 --> 05:26.872
than have their partner get wounded.

05:31.872 --> 05:33.112
They're clean, Arabela.

05:38.032 --> 05:39.032
Thanks.

05:43.152 --> 05:44.152
How is he?

05:45.112 --> 05:48.672
He's still unconscious, but
the bullet did not penetrate.

05:49.032 --> 05:50.112
It's a grazing wound.

05:50.552 --> 05:51.552
What happened?

05:52.112 --> 05:55.392
We were investigating a robbery
where two officers had been murdered,

05:55.952 --> 05:59.352
and we were shot at from the
rooftop of the adjacent building.

05:59.552 --> 06:00.552
No warning?

06:00.952 --> 06:02.392
The area had been declared clear,

06:02.512 --> 06:04.272
and the local police were at the restaurant

06:04.392 --> 06:05.832
where the officers were gunned down.

06:06.192 --> 06:07.392
We thought it was safe.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.952
And why would they ambush them like that?

06:10.072 --> 06:11.712
To the extent that assholes ever do,

06:11.832 --> 06:13.552
these robbers haven't made any sense.

06:14.152 --> 06:16.592
They enter these stores
as loudly as possible.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.832
They don't seem to mind
turning off some alarms,

06:18.952 --> 06:21.552
and leaving other ones on,
and then, when we arrive,

06:21.672 --> 06:24.712
we discover that nothing of
any value was even stolen.

06:25.232 --> 06:27.512
Peculiar modus operandi for...

06:27.792 --> 06:29.472
You'd think these people, of all people,

06:29.752 --> 06:31.152
would want to stay under the radar.

06:31.352 --> 06:32.592
Can we be certain it's them?

06:34.152 --> 06:35.152
In the negative.

06:36.152 --> 06:38.712
Just got off the phone with the
detectives at the latest robbery.

06:39.152 --> 06:41.152
The gang accomplished
the exact same disruption

06:41.312 --> 06:42.632
of electricity and cameras,

06:43.272 --> 06:46.272
but left no trace of themselves,
but did leave jewelry behind.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.672
So the fact that they
don't leave any evidence

06:48.792 --> 06:50.032
is now becoming evidence.

06:51.432 --> 06:54.152
Sort of like the absence of
matter proves a black hole.

06:54.392 --> 06:56.048
Well, then, why don't we
forget about the evidence.

06:56.072 --> 06:58.568
If we can figure out what they're
getting out of these robberies,

06:58.592 --> 07:00.792
we might be able to predict
what their next move is.

07:16.152 --> 07:17.592
When I started the team,

07:20.472 --> 07:21.632
Dorn asked me

07:22.992 --> 07:25.512
if I was doing it for the right reason.

07:28.272 --> 07:33.712
At the time, I thought he meant
I was trying to get revenge.

07:38.392 --> 07:43.352
Ã‰tienne had been killed one year before.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.072
Things were very bad.

07:51.832 --> 07:54.472
But now, I think,

07:56.792 --> 07:58.792
I was looking for another family.

08:01.592 --> 08:03.632
I never told you this before,

08:05.792 --> 08:09.632
but you were the last
person I chose for my team,

08:10.512 --> 08:12.672
and a lot of people told me not to.

08:14.112 --> 08:17.192
But I knew you were the right man.

08:18.552 --> 08:19.552
Then...

08:20.912 --> 08:24.752
you have become more than that to me.

08:31.392 --> 08:32.952
I don't want to lose you, Tommy.

08:41.072 --> 08:42.751
I don't want to lose another son.

08:44.312 --> 08:45.992
- Major.
- Yes?

08:47.632 --> 08:48.832
I'm trying to sleep.

08:53.752 --> 08:54.752
Yeah.

08:57.352 --> 08:58.352
Yeah.

08:59.232 --> 09:00.912
This just can't be.

09:02.552 --> 09:04.512
- I'm sorry?
- This latest robbery.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.392
The detectives said they can see
the robbers went into the office

09:07.512 --> 09:08.872
but left the safe alone again,

09:08.992 --> 09:10.992
and I'm thinking, what
else is kept in an office?

09:11.472 --> 09:12.472
Records.

09:13.032 --> 09:14.072
And a computer, right,

09:14.232 --> 09:18.352
but I'm in the hard drive
of that computer right now,

09:18.552 --> 09:21.872
and it looks like no one even
used the computer for days.

09:22.232 --> 09:25.112
What the hell were they doing in
the office of both jewelry stores?

09:25.472 --> 09:27.192
Why can't we figure out what's going on?

09:28.672 --> 09:32.272
Have you resolved that matter that
was troubling you when we last spoke?

09:33.192 --> 09:34.192
Not yet.

09:36.352 --> 09:40.552
Hmm. Well, I am here for you whenever.

09:41.912 --> 09:45.032
There needs to be a conversation with
someone that I can't have right now.

09:45.632 --> 09:46.632
All right.

09:47.592 --> 09:48.752
He is awake.

09:57.272 --> 09:58.352
What are you doing?

09:58.512 --> 09:59.512
I'm getting out of here.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.112
Tommy, you've been unconscious for hours.

10:02.472 --> 10:03.712
Means I'm well rested.

10:04.552 --> 10:06.672
Please, Tommy, think about this.

10:06.952 --> 10:08.352
Arabela's right, Detective.

10:08.752 --> 10:10.992
Being on your feet is not a good idea.

10:11.112 --> 10:12.112
All due respect, sir,

10:12.232 --> 10:14.472
I don't give a damn if you
think it's a good idea or not.

10:18.592 --> 10:19.592
I'm sorry.

10:20.672 --> 10:22.392
Look, I am, I appreciate the concern,

10:22.552 --> 10:24.048
but we've got a bunch of escaped convicts

10:24.072 --> 10:26.672
tearing around Europe committing
robberies and killing cops.

10:27.392 --> 10:29.472
If that's not what this
team is for, then nothing is.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.592
I'm not sitting on the
sideline with a headache.

10:31.952 --> 10:32.672
You sure?

10:32.792 --> 10:34.872
Aye. We have to stop them, boss.

10:35.072 --> 10:38.232
I gotta say, I'm tired of just
reacting to these scumbags myself.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.192
It's time to get a little proactive

10:41.232 --> 10:42.792
and get a step ahead of them for once.

10:43.472 --> 10:47.632
Okay, we regroup in the waiting room.
We are going to plan our next move.

10:54.072 --> 10:55.152
When this is over,

10:56.672 --> 10:58.272
you and I got something to talk about.

10:58.832 --> 10:59.872
Talk now.

11:00.472 --> 11:01.752
Wrong place, wrong time.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.272
But we'll get to the bottom of it.

11:05.672 --> 11:06.872
"It?"

11:09.752 --> 11:10.752
The tiger.

11:19.152 --> 11:20.152
Doesn't matter.

11:20.752 --> 11:21.752
Yes.

11:22.272 --> 11:23.552
Everything is on schedule.

11:24.592 --> 11:28.672
After tonight, we all disappear and
live the life of the very, very rich.

11:33.072 --> 11:35.232
Come on, guys, let's get some rest.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.512
Tonight's going to be a big night.

11:49.272 --> 11:50.272
So...

11:51.512 --> 11:52.752
two prison breaks,

11:53.912 --> 11:56.352
two small jewelry store
robberies, six murders,

11:56.472 --> 11:57.872
and one attempted murder.

11:58.192 --> 12:00.072
No, I'm not so sure they
were trying to kill me.

12:00.112 --> 12:01.632
I saw the shadow before the shot.

12:02.592 --> 12:03.592
What do you mean?

12:03.792 --> 12:04.792
I hung up the call,

12:05.152 --> 12:07.088
and I was talking to
Arabela when I saw the shadow

12:07.112 --> 12:08.192
of the rifle on the ground.

12:08.392 --> 12:10.872
That's why I was able to turn
my head at the last minute.

12:11.312 --> 12:12.352
So they missed?

12:12.552 --> 12:14.512
No, not exactly, but they waited too long.

12:14.832 --> 12:17.272
I mean, we were stationary.
I was making call after call,

12:17.432 --> 12:19.432
so I feel like the shooter
waited for me to notice,

12:19.832 --> 12:21.992
and then he shot across my
head rather than through it.

12:22.152 --> 12:24.392
That would be an incredibly delicate shot.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.632
- Yeah? I could make it.
- Are you sure?

12:26.912 --> 12:29.752
It doesn't matter anyway. Let's
just say that that shot is possible.

12:29.872 --> 12:31.752
This all feels wrong, doesn't it?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.992
It's like everything they've done is a...

12:34.192 --> 12:36.672
is a smoke screen. A misdirection.

12:36.992 --> 12:39.152
- Like magicians.
- Yeah, just like that.

12:39.352 --> 12:41.608
"Here, look here at this hand,"
while the other hand hides the coin.

12:41.632 --> 12:44.072
Think about it. They wanted
the cops at the scenes,

12:44.552 --> 12:46.152
they wanted the robberies discovered.

12:46.312 --> 12:48.032
Heck, they probably even wanted us to come.

12:48.072 --> 12:50.392
Everything about these
guys is maximum attention.

12:50.672 --> 12:52.592
They used giant car bombs
to break out of prison.

12:52.632 --> 12:54.392
Certainly crossed enough borders since.

12:55.072 --> 12:58.272
It's almost as if they were
demanding our involvement in this.

12:58.672 --> 13:01.208
They wouldn't be the first to
purposely make us part of their plan.

13:01.232 --> 13:02.632
Yeah, but we're so well publicized.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.472
It's common knowledge that that strategy

13:04.632 --> 13:06.432
has not worked for those
who have employed it.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.552
But why?

13:07.952 --> 13:10.832
What could they possibly
gain from our involvement?

13:11.112 --> 13:13.832
Because when we are
looking, no one else is.

13:14.152 --> 13:16.752
Everywhere we've gone,
the locals backed off.

13:17.272 --> 13:18.752
That's absolutely true, Louis.

13:19.392 --> 13:21.632
We've been granted
extraordinary autonomy here.

13:22.112 --> 13:24.192
So now we're involved,
what do we do about it?

13:24.752 --> 13:26.032
We take a step back.

13:26.592 --> 13:29.352
Re-evaluate what we have from
the standpoint of everything

13:30.032 --> 13:33.512
was done on purpose.
Everything, deliberate.

13:34.192 --> 13:37.192
Louis, the Marseille police took the
psychologist to that villa, right?

13:37.352 --> 13:38.712
- Doctor Clarke?
- Yes.

13:39.072 --> 13:40.352
Good, they'll have her address.

13:40.672 --> 13:42.752
You have something, Hickman, what is it?

13:42.992 --> 13:44.072
These guys are good,

13:45.112 --> 13:48.112
yet they left all the victim's
cell phones in the building

13:48.272 --> 13:49.392
where she was rescued.

13:49.672 --> 13:51.592
At the time, I thought
they'd made a mistake.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.432
- Assume it was not a mistake.
- They wanted her found?

13:54.832 --> 13:56.792
- Maybe it's part of it.
- Do you think she knows?

13:57.072 --> 14:00.032
Maybe, maybe not. I definitely
want to talk to her and find out.

14:00.392 --> 14:02.352
I said to Sebastian when
we were at the prison,

14:02.512 --> 14:06.272
there's something about that
video, the CCTV footage, it just...

14:06.832 --> 14:08.552
it doesn't sit right, and if I talk to her,

14:08.592 --> 14:10.112
maybe I could figure out what that is.

14:10.192 --> 14:11.792
Local police say they brought everything

14:11.952 --> 14:13.672
from the latest robbery into their station.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.912
The gang was nearly
caught and left quickly.

14:16.152 --> 14:19.272
Maybe... they made a mistake
and left something this time.

14:19.432 --> 14:23.192
Okay. Carl, go to the
villa, interview the doctor.

14:23.312 --> 14:27.152
Tommy, Arabela, Sebastian, we
will set up at the local station.

14:28.192 --> 14:29.992
I doubt these wankers make mistakes.

14:30.672 --> 14:31.912
Bound to make one some time.

14:35.032 --> 14:37.192
- Who were you calling?
- What's that?

14:37.552 --> 14:39.592
You said you were stationary
making call after call.

14:39.632 --> 14:41.152
Oh, shite! Has anyone talked to Eva?

14:41.392 --> 14:43.472
I tried. She's not answering.

14:43.872 --> 14:46.872
- What are you talking about?
- She called Tommy from Spain.

14:47.032 --> 14:50.232
She sounded scared, definitely
upset. She wanted me to come there.

14:50.392 --> 14:51.992
Did she say what it was? What was wrong?

14:52.072 --> 14:53.432
No, just that she wanted me there.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.312
Does anyone know exactly
where she is in Spain?

14:57.472 --> 14:59.152
I know where she was last.

14:59.592 --> 15:00.752
I can track her phone.

15:01.512 --> 15:04.192
Okay. I will go there, I will find her.

15:04.312 --> 15:06.392
No, Louis, I will go.

15:07.312 --> 15:10.192
Will someone please advise the
helicopter that I will be there?

15:12.312 --> 15:15.472
When I was finishing her
background check for the ICC,

15:16.272 --> 15:18.352
an Italian journalist of my acquaintance

15:18.512 --> 15:20.072
invited me to review a file.

15:20.432 --> 15:22.912
When Sergeant Vittoria
spoke to me yesterday,

15:23.712 --> 15:26.912
she said she was "chasing a ghost."

15:28.392 --> 15:30.472
That file was about a ghost.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.512
She is in desperately dangerous territory.

15:44.172 --> 15:45.172
Thank you.

15:48.492 --> 15:50.932
Uh, I'm good. You don't have to wait around.

15:51.132 --> 15:52.972
Right. I'll call you. Thanks.

16:02.492 --> 16:03.492
Nice place.

16:11.412 --> 16:12.932
How goes the self-treatment, Doc?

16:13.412 --> 16:15.172
Detective Hickman, welcome.

16:15.852 --> 16:18.092
I can certainly see why you
preferred this to a hospital.

16:18.572 --> 16:20.612
Well, the point was to be
in familiar surroundings,

16:21.092 --> 16:23.372
but the special nature of
this location is a bonus.

16:23.532 --> 16:25.052
- Yeah.
- Can I offer you a drink?

16:25.532 --> 16:27.292
Uh, something soft would be great,

16:27.532 --> 16:29.452
but please, have whatever you'd like.

16:29.892 --> 16:30.892
I usually do.

16:31.932 --> 16:32.932
Good for you.

16:35.612 --> 16:36.772
- Major Daniel.
- Yeah.

16:36.932 --> 16:38.572
Inspector Cambert of the National Police.

16:38.892 --> 16:40.212
It is an honor to meet you.

16:40.412 --> 16:42.692
Wow. That's what people
say when you've retired.

16:43.012 --> 16:44.532
Well, no, that's not what I meant...

16:44.692 --> 16:46.812
I'm joking, Cambert. The honor is mine.

16:47.492 --> 16:50.252
McConnell, Berger, Seeger,
three of my investigators.

16:50.372 --> 16:51.372
EnchantÃ©.

16:51.772 --> 16:52.772
You look much better.

16:53.572 --> 16:55.452
I was in the alley as
you were being taken away.

16:55.732 --> 16:57.492
Well, luckily, they
only shot me in the head.

16:57.852 --> 16:58.892
I am glad you're okay.

16:59.612 --> 17:03.252
Well, um, we have all the
evidence from the last robbery.

17:05.452 --> 17:06.692
My attempt at a joke.

17:06.852 --> 17:09.092
There is no evidence. Not a trace.

17:09.692 --> 17:12.531
We even swept the rooftop and
couldn't find a shell casing,

17:12.932 --> 17:15.332
and we know a shot was fired from there.

17:15.692 --> 17:17.172
How did they get into the store?

17:17.452 --> 17:19.771
Broke through the rear
door into the storage room.

17:20.132 --> 17:21.132
Crudely.

17:21.252 --> 17:23.492
And nothing from the main
room beyond was taken.

17:24.051 --> 17:26.092
Why would jewelry thieves
break into a jewelry store

17:26.132 --> 17:27.531
and not take any jewels?

17:28.012 --> 17:31.492
See? There's something about the
offices in these jewelry stores.

17:31.892 --> 17:33.772
If they had been a little stealthy

17:34.052 --> 17:36.492
we wouldn't have even
known about the crime.

17:36.652 --> 17:38.132
The store has been closed for days.

17:38.372 --> 17:39.372
Out of business?

17:39.492 --> 17:43.452
No, the owners are in Cannes
for some sort of gathering.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.372
The store will open again next week.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.108
You didn't by any chance bring
the office computer in, did you?

17:48.132 --> 17:49.732
- Mm-hmm.
- I remotely accessed it,

17:49.932 --> 17:51.772
but I'd really like to
be able to hard-wire in.

17:51.852 --> 17:53.052
I'll have it brought directly.

17:54.132 --> 17:56.012
Eva, this is Dorn again.

17:56.532 --> 17:59.852
I need you to respond
to my calls. It's urgent.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.212
If you are going to meet with
whom I fear you have been chasing,

18:03.372 --> 18:05.932
you must not, under any circumstances,

18:06.092 --> 18:08.012
do that alone, do you understand?

18:08.252 --> 18:09.892
I'm on my way to you. Wait for me.

18:12.052 --> 18:14.732
Leon, we need to go faster.

18:15.012 --> 18:18.732
The helicopter is ready and
I am in a desperate hurry.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.092
Ah, thank you.

18:23.932 --> 18:27.452
- Consuelo...
- No, no, no. I'll... I'll get it.

18:27.812 --> 18:29.172
Oh, nonsense, you're my guest.

18:31.412 --> 18:34.252
- Am I?
- Excuse me?

18:35.852 --> 18:36.892
Your guest?

18:37.452 --> 18:38.948
Have I treated you as though you aren't?

18:38.972 --> 18:40.852
I've just never had a
crime victim call me that.

18:41.932 --> 18:42.932
No?

18:43.652 --> 18:44.692
Now that I think about it,

18:44.732 --> 18:46.732
I've never had one actually
glad to see me, either.

18:46.852 --> 18:49.252
They don't banter, don't offer me wine.

18:50.372 --> 18:52.852
I almost feel as though I
failed some sort of test.

18:53.052 --> 18:54.052
Not at all.

18:54.452 --> 18:56.812
They just usually want me to
finish as quickly as possible

18:56.972 --> 18:58.172
and get the hell out of there.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.732
Putting my psychiatrist hat on,

19:01.532 --> 19:04.012
that must be emotionally
rather difficult for you.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.372
Actually, it's not difficult at all,

19:09.852 --> 19:11.012
because it's normal.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.692
Well, I guess that says
more about me than you.

19:17.532 --> 19:22.012
Well, from here on, for your sake,

19:22.732 --> 19:26.252
I will endeavor to be more,
as you call it, "normal."

19:29.572 --> 19:31.252
- Here.
- Thanks, man.

19:32.332 --> 19:35.812
- Are you all right?
- Aye, I just hate waiting... Da.

19:35.972 --> 19:37.052
Let's keep that between us.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.212
Nothing.

19:41.452 --> 19:42.452
Nothing.

19:43.012 --> 19:45.772
Look here. None of this has been accessed.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.532
They didn't even attempt it.

19:48.052 --> 19:50.372
They killed two cops and shot at Tommy.

19:50.492 --> 19:51.772
They must be after something.

19:52.012 --> 19:53.772
When did the store close exactly?

19:54.012 --> 19:55.372
Cambert said four days ago.

19:55.772 --> 19:57.372
What is this gathering they've gone to?

19:57.492 --> 19:58.172
I don't know.

19:58.332 --> 20:01.092
It's strange that the entire
staff would go away like that.

20:01.252 --> 20:02.252
I'll go check.

20:02.652 --> 20:05.292
It has to be the computer. It has to.

20:06.052 --> 20:08.452
May I ask you a personal question?

20:09.172 --> 20:10.532
It depends on the question.

20:12.892 --> 20:16.372
How does a prison psychiatrist
afford a villa in the South of France?

20:17.852 --> 20:18.852
That's funny?

20:19.372 --> 20:20.372
No.

20:20.772 --> 20:22.972
It's just that there are so
many more personal questions

20:23.092 --> 20:24.092
you could have asked me.

20:24.452 --> 20:27.132
I said I had access to a
villa, I didn't say I owned one.

20:27.412 --> 20:29.612
Right. Right, you did say that.

20:29.972 --> 20:32.052
This home belongs to a banker from Paris.

20:32.132 --> 20:33.812
Ah, I see.

20:34.452 --> 20:35.772
I'm quite sure you don't.

20:37.092 --> 20:38.132
He was a patient.

20:38.692 --> 20:41.332
He's happily involved with
a gorgeous, much younger man.

20:41.692 --> 20:42.692
Is that commonplace?

20:43.132 --> 20:44.612
An older man with a younger lover?

20:46.132 --> 20:48.212
A psychiatrist staying at patient's home.

20:49.372 --> 20:51.892
No. No, in fact, it
would be fairly unethical,

20:52.172 --> 20:54.532
except it was a year after
I stopped treating him

20:54.892 --> 20:56.452
that we became friends, and then a year

20:56.492 --> 20:58.468
after that that I came and
stayed here for the first time.

20:58.492 --> 21:00.052
Well, that explains it then.

21:01.292 --> 21:03.628
There's something really enjoyable
about conversing with you.

21:03.652 --> 21:04.652
No kidding?

21:07.172 --> 21:09.292
I didn't expect quite so
many questions about me.

21:09.892 --> 21:11.692
What did you expect questions about?

21:12.092 --> 21:14.292
Lucien, the escapees, my detention.

21:14.412 --> 21:16.412
Okay. How did you keep
them from raping you?

21:17.012 --> 21:18.892
Wow, you've got straight to it.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.652
You were taken by two escaped convicts,

21:21.052 --> 21:23.172
two desperate criminals, for two days?

21:23.372 --> 21:25.092
- Yes.
- Tied up, incapacitated.

21:25.212 --> 21:26.692
- Completely.
- You weren't assaulted?

21:27.372 --> 21:29.428
I assume you would have said
something if you had been.

21:29.452 --> 21:31.268
Don't get me wrong, I'm
happy that you weren't,

21:31.292 --> 21:34.452
I just find it kind of... surprising.

21:35.452 --> 21:38.612
It's not surprising at
all. I'm a psychiatrist.

21:39.252 --> 21:41.772
I'm quite adept at
controlling people with words.

21:42.252 --> 21:45.012
Plus, my professional
relationship with Lucien

21:45.172 --> 21:47.932
not only made him completely
uninterested in me in that way,

21:48.652 --> 21:50.972
it made him want to protect
me from the other three.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.732
My question seems to have offended you.

21:53.492 --> 21:56.332
No. I know you've got a job to do.

21:57.172 --> 21:59.772
You say that Lucien was uninterested?

22:09.692 --> 22:10.692
Excuse me.

22:13.012 --> 22:14.052
I'll be right here.

22:16.412 --> 22:17.132
Carl?

22:17.252 --> 22:19.052
I know what was bothering
me about the video.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.172
Have Sebastian show you the
CCTV footage from the prison.

22:22.372 --> 22:24.292
When Lucien leaps from
his chair at the Doctor's,

22:24.412 --> 22:25.892
don't look at him, watch her.

22:26.252 --> 22:28.292
I'm pretty sure she doesn't flinch. At all.

22:28.652 --> 22:30.092
Like she knew he was going to do it.

22:30.212 --> 22:32.772
- I will look.
- Yeah. Text me and let me know.

22:34.292 --> 22:36.573
I'm starting to think that
our doctor is no victim at all.

22:38.012 --> 22:39.972
She may be in on the whole damned thing.

22:45.252 --> 22:46.452
Would you like some fresh tea?

22:46.492 --> 22:49.452
- I'm good, thank you. So, we were...
- What's wrong with your hand?

22:50.372 --> 22:53.092
- Pardon me?
- Why the single glove?

22:53.452 --> 22:55.012
- Work injury.
- Severe?

22:55.772 --> 22:57.732
- Fairly.
- Recent?

22:59.132 --> 23:00.332
Some time ago.

23:01.012 --> 23:02.812
Why are you so hesitant to discuss it?

23:03.012 --> 23:04.012
Hesitant?

23:04.412 --> 23:05.652
It's called avoidance.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.268
You're giving me the least
amount of information possible

23:08.292 --> 23:09.852
in response to each question.

23:10.652 --> 23:11.772
Is that what I'm doing?

23:11.972 --> 23:13.612
It wasn't simply an injury.

23:13.932 --> 23:17.412
You were shot in New York
by a child abduction suspect.

23:18.932 --> 23:20.052
What was it you said?

23:20.492 --> 23:22.612
"Google makes us all seem smarter?"

23:23.172 --> 23:25.852
Now, why would you Google me?

23:26.172 --> 23:28.772
An American police detective in Marseille,

23:28.972 --> 23:31.772
it's not something one
expects. I was intrigued.

23:32.372 --> 23:35.212
It said the man that wounded you
escaped, that he's still out there.

23:36.052 --> 23:37.052
That must weigh on you.

23:37.732 --> 23:39.532
I imagine it makes life quite difficult.

23:51.332 --> 23:53.412
- Her phone is still not on.
- How long?

23:53.972 --> 23:55.868
The last five or six hours
since she called Tommy.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.812
Well, send me the GPS coordinates
of the last one, all right?

23:59.372 --> 24:00.372
On the way.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.012
And does anyone know where
she was staying in Spain?

24:03.732 --> 24:05.372
I'll send you the hotel information, too.

24:05.932 --> 24:06.932
Thank you.

24:07.812 --> 24:08.812
Is he in Spain?

24:09.332 --> 24:11.612
Yeah, but, Eva's phone
hasn't been on for hours.

24:12.052 --> 24:14.132
If anyone can find her, Dorn can.

24:15.132 --> 24:17.452
Okay, what about this? Anything?

24:19.532 --> 24:20.772
It's just impossible.

24:21.972 --> 24:23.732
There is no way you can access a system

24:23.852 --> 24:25.612
and not leave any trace you were there.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.492
Every time you move a mouse,
the computer records it.

24:28.612 --> 24:31.692
It just does. Deep in the
bios, there's a record.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.812
You can no more get that to stop happening

24:33.932 --> 24:35.852
than you could stop time from...

24:38.412 --> 24:39.132
Sebastian?

24:39.292 --> 24:41.508
The jewelry store wasn't just
closed for any old gathering.

24:41.532 --> 24:43.252
There's a major auction
happening in Cannes.

24:43.452 --> 24:45.588
Some of the world's most
valuable jewelry will be there.

24:45.612 --> 24:47.932
That sounds like something for
the Radic Group to go after.

24:48.372 --> 24:49.372
Yes!

24:49.932 --> 24:52.292
- You got in?
- Phony son of a bitch.

24:54.172 --> 24:55.212
More like around.

24:55.852 --> 24:58.212
Like Hickman said... magic.

24:58.812 --> 25:00.852
You know how a magician
makes something disappear?

25:01.132 --> 25:03.612
By dropping something
in front of it to make

25:03.772 --> 25:05.692
the background appear to be the foreground.

25:06.852 --> 25:08.492
Did anyone understand what he just said?

25:08.772 --> 25:09.772
I do.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.932
They're changing what you think you see.

25:12.852 --> 25:13.852
Exactly.

25:14.332 --> 25:16.332
Sebastian. Give me the headline.

25:17.812 --> 25:19.412
I know what they got from this computer.

25:21.852 --> 25:24.332
So is your hand completely unusable now?

25:24.452 --> 25:27.292
You treated Lucien Fiori
for two years? Twice a week?

25:27.412 --> 25:28.412
Oh, we're back to that?

25:28.532 --> 25:30.292
My history is not why I'm here.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.492
I find your deflection really interesting.

25:35.172 --> 25:37.252
Deflection, avoidance, I'm a basket case.

25:38.492 --> 25:40.772
More than 200 sessions.

25:42.012 --> 25:43.732
That's a lot, isn't it?

25:44.492 --> 25:45.292
Sorry, I...

25:45.452 --> 25:47.252
For one doctor to treat one patient,

25:47.412 --> 25:49.892
that seems like a tremendous
amount of time to be in very

25:50.092 --> 25:53.732
stressful situations, intense situations.

25:54.732 --> 25:56.012
One could think so.

25:59.132 --> 26:01.972
Doctor, I want you to know that
I don't consider you an enemy,

26:02.652 --> 26:04.332
and I don't consider you bad.

26:06.932 --> 26:08.852
Most people consider convicts stupid.

26:10.532 --> 26:11.532
If they were smart,

26:11.612 --> 26:13.932
they wouldn't find themselves
in prison in the first place.

26:14.772 --> 26:16.652
But for those of us
that work in the system,

26:16.812 --> 26:18.932
we know that that isn't true.

26:19.052 --> 26:21.612
They may not be educated in
the formal sense, but a good,

26:22.132 --> 26:24.732
good many of them are
extremely street smart.

26:25.932 --> 26:29.292
And they can be very adept at manipulation.

26:30.732 --> 26:32.332
I suppose that could be true.

26:32.492 --> 26:34.292
You don't suppose it, you've lived it.

26:35.652 --> 26:36.412
Sorry?

26:36.532 --> 26:38.932
200 hours is certainly
enough time for somebody

26:39.092 --> 26:42.092
already disposed to
compassion toward an inmate,

26:42.212 --> 26:45.852
such as his doctor, to
be influenced by him.

26:47.452 --> 26:50.732
To be... how did you put it?

26:51.532 --> 26:53.332
Controlled by his words.

26:54.172 --> 26:56.012
I really don't know what
you're talking about.

26:57.252 --> 26:59.292
This is the footage taken from your office

26:59.412 --> 27:00.708
right before the lights went out.

27:00.732 --> 27:02.972
You see how Fiori leaps
from his chair at you?

27:04.812 --> 27:06.572
You didn't even flinch, did you, Anna?

27:07.852 --> 27:09.572
You knew he was going to do it, didn't you?

27:18.012 --> 27:19.012
I'm sorry.

27:24.292 --> 27:25.332
Let me help you.

27:25.892 --> 27:27.052
I don't need your help.

27:27.172 --> 27:29.292
Trust me on this, Anna,
you are running out of time.

27:29.732 --> 27:34.052
If you let them hurt more people
now that you're away from them,

27:34.172 --> 27:35.732
now that you're out of physical danger,

27:35.812 --> 27:37.612
there won't be anything
that I can do for you.

27:41.852 --> 27:43.372
I thought he loved me,

27:44.492 --> 27:46.292
and then he... he just...

27:46.852 --> 27:49.132
dumped me when he didn't need me anymore.

27:49.492 --> 27:50.772
He just threw me away.

27:52.092 --> 27:54.052
I feel so stupid.

27:54.892 --> 27:57.812
I've ruined everything, my career, my life.

27:58.212 --> 27:59.292
Not if you help me.

27:59.732 --> 28:00.732
What?

28:01.812 --> 28:04.452
What are they planning? The real job?

28:06.292 --> 28:07.412
If I did?

28:07.932 --> 28:09.452
If you help me stop them,

28:10.852 --> 28:13.492
I'll do everything I can to
keep this from hurting you.

28:14.892 --> 28:16.372
Can I trust you?

28:17.092 --> 28:18.212
You have to.

28:49.710 --> 28:52.550
Okay, we're there. The
glass alarms are disabled.

28:55.990 --> 29:00.990
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 21st Annual Jewel Auction!

29:03.630 --> 29:04.670
The auction is beginning.

29:05.630 --> 29:08.230
- Tommy?
- Good to go here, Major.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.190
We are all in position, Cambert.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.230
First up, ladies and gentlemen,

29:18.350 --> 29:23.310
we have this magnificent 100
karat dolphin diamond necklace.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.390
A magnificent piece, I'm sure you'll agree.

29:25.870 --> 29:30.430
Let's start the bidding at
80,000. Do I have 80,000?

29:39.350 --> 29:40.350
Come on.

29:40.950 --> 29:41.950
Almost there.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.270
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

29:51.150 --> 29:53.190
Please. Please, slow down.

29:53.310 --> 29:55.310
It's only our first of the
evening, you understand.

29:55.430 --> 29:56.630
You're making me dizzy here.

30:01.510 --> 30:02.510
Ready.

30:03.270 --> 30:04.270
Hold a moment.

30:12.150 --> 30:13.910
- Security.
- Who is this?

30:14.070 --> 30:14.790
Security.

30:14.950 --> 30:17.070
What the hell are you doing
answering my wife's phone?

30:17.870 --> 30:19.870
Who is this? This is the office of...

30:20.030 --> 30:22.470
You tell that slut not to
even bother coming home!

30:24.790 --> 30:25.910
Video feeds are mine.

30:26.470 --> 30:27.470
Who was that?

30:28.150 --> 30:31.870
I don't know. Some weird guy
who wanted to talk to his wife.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.670
They can only see what I
want them to from now on.

30:38.830 --> 30:41.630
300,000! 300,000! Madam!

30:42.350 --> 30:46.190
300,000, sold, to the
lady in the white jacket!

30:48.710 --> 30:50.310
Congratulations, Madam.

30:53.870 --> 30:55.470
That's a wonderful start to the evening.

30:56.110 --> 30:57.830
Now, up next, ladies and gentlemen...

30:57.950 --> 30:58.950
We're ready.

30:59.350 --> 31:02.190
Remember, from the moment I
disrupt the motion sensors,

31:02.310 --> 31:05.910
you only have two minutes and 59
seconds to get off the main floor.

31:06.070 --> 31:06.870
At three minutes,

31:06.990 --> 31:08.806
the system will read the
failure of the generator

31:08.830 --> 31:10.070
to take over as a breach.

31:10.990 --> 31:12.070
- Ready?
- Okay?

31:12.230 --> 31:13.830
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

31:17.430 --> 31:19.110
2:59. Go.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.550
- We're at the elevators.
- Okay.

31:35.550 --> 31:36.550
Now.

31:43.830 --> 31:45.470
Elevator one at the top and shut down.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.470
Shaft is yours. 1:20 left.

31:52.910 --> 31:55.550
- Okay, we're ready.
- Sending the rest to the basement.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.030
- See you at the bottom.
- Okay.

32:08.830 --> 32:11.550
Gentleman in the middle table there,

32:11.670 --> 32:15.750
400,000 Euro, sold! Congratulations, sir!

32:20.230 --> 32:21.350
We are in the basement.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.270
20-seconds to spare. Nicely done.

32:26.470 --> 32:28.270
Main floor motion detector is back online.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.430
Dusek? How are you doing?

32:33.110 --> 32:36.030
If the measurements you gave
me are right, I'm almost there.

32:36.630 --> 32:38.630
And no names over the comms.

32:39.110 --> 32:41.630
Relax, no one even knows we're here.

32:41.830 --> 32:43.230
Then say your name.

32:44.750 --> 32:46.270
Measurements are dead on, aren't they?

32:48.870 --> 32:51.350
Yeah. Trash chute open, I think.

32:52.230 --> 32:53.910
It's the trash chute, believe me.

32:56.630 --> 32:57.630
Okay, we're good.

32:58.230 --> 33:00.750
The rest of the alarms are all
controlled from inside that safe.

33:00.830 --> 33:03.150
Once the fire alarm goes
off, I'm just an observer.

33:03.470 --> 33:05.246
I'll let you know the
status of the responses,

33:05.270 --> 33:06.870
but apart than that, I...

33:06.990 --> 33:09.430
- Shut the hell up, Morand.
- No names.

33:09.830 --> 33:10.830
Go.

33:14.030 --> 33:16.030
Always wanted to say this...

33:17.150 --> 33:18.790
Fire in the hole!

33:32.870 --> 33:34.310
- Shit.
- What's that?

33:34.470 --> 33:35.630
Fire in the garbage room.

33:48.310 --> 33:50.430
- Be fast, but correct, yeah?
- No problem.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.350
Fire department on the way, boys.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.630
250 for this piece. 250!

34:16.909 --> 34:19.310
You're a genius, man. Amazing job, Viktor.

34:19.630 --> 34:21.070
Not much time. Come on.

34:25.989 --> 34:28.429
Party time. We're in the vault. We're in.

34:28.630 --> 34:29.790
All the locks are disabled.

34:36.909 --> 34:37.909
Come on, ladies.

34:40.469 --> 34:41.670
Yes!

34:53.590 --> 34:54.590
Fire's out, boys.

34:55.989 --> 34:57.430
Okay, time to go.

35:07.710 --> 35:09.950
Phew. It won't stop smoking, man.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.030
Don't move!

35:52.630 --> 35:53.630
Don't move.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.350
Remember me?

36:00.910 --> 36:01.910
Sorry.

36:07.510 --> 36:09.366
- Step down from the van!
- Hands above your head.

36:09.390 --> 36:10.390
Step down!

36:17.270 --> 36:18.510
Ghost Zero, huh?

36:18.830 --> 36:19.590
Who the hell are you?

36:19.750 --> 36:21.366
The guy who's going to make you so famous

36:21.390 --> 36:23.350
you'll never be able to
access a computer again.

37:06.270 --> 37:07.350
Buenos Tardes, SeÃ±or.

37:09.710 --> 37:11.230
Sergeant Eva Vittoria.

37:12.270 --> 37:16.030
SÃ­. She left about 20 minutes ago.

37:16.910 --> 37:18.110
Give me the key.

37:19.710 --> 37:20.710
Yes, sir.

37:24.270 --> 37:25.350
Second floor, sir.

38:42.070 --> 38:45.270
Carl, it's over. They are all in custody.

38:46.390 --> 38:47.910
I'm on my way to pick you up.

38:50.830 --> 38:51.830
Any news?

38:52.230 --> 38:54.710
They're in custody. All of them.

38:55.270 --> 38:56.270
They are?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.030
Is that a surprise?

38:59.590 --> 39:02.190
What, you don't believe
me? You think I'm bluffing?

39:02.430 --> 39:05.630
No, I... I told you
what they were planning.

39:05.990 --> 39:07.510
Yeah, you did tell me something.

39:08.070 --> 39:10.230
Well, that's... that's good
that they've been caught.

39:10.670 --> 39:11.670
Is it?

39:12.230 --> 39:15.230
Yeah. Those animals belong behind bars.

39:15.430 --> 39:16.790
You can stop now.

39:17.510 --> 39:19.670
- Excuse me?
- The one thing about helping you

39:19.790 --> 39:22.630
is that it was based on
you telling me the truth.

39:23.710 --> 39:25.510
You've just said that they're in custody?

39:25.630 --> 39:28.350
Yeah, but they weren't caught at
the auction that you sent us to.

39:28.830 --> 39:29.590
What?

39:29.790 --> 39:31.590
You see, our tech figured
out what your hacker

39:31.630 --> 39:33.630
was getting from those
jewelry store computers,

39:33.750 --> 39:35.310
the real location of the jewels.

39:35.470 --> 39:38.030
An auction like that uses fakes publicly,

39:38.150 --> 39:40.190
but they keep the real stuff close by.

39:40.350 --> 39:42.550
The real jewels were in a bank nearby,

39:42.710 --> 39:45.230
the real target of the robbery.

39:47.230 --> 39:48.670
You the one who took the shot at me.

39:50.390 --> 39:52.870
- I wouldn't have missed.
- No.

39:54.910 --> 39:56.030
You shouldn't have missed.

39:56.310 --> 39:59.070
When I get out, I'm going
to come and find you.

40:00.470 --> 40:03.310
If you get out, you won't have to find me.

40:04.190 --> 40:08.030
I'll be waiting right outside
that prison, with bells on.

40:10.830 --> 40:12.030
Answer my question.

40:12.270 --> 40:15.190
Hey, listen, I don't
understand why I'm here.

40:15.870 --> 40:16.990
I think you do.

40:17.950 --> 40:18.950
No.

40:19.430 --> 40:21.710
So you didn't participate
in the robbery at the bank?

40:22.310 --> 40:24.550
What? What robbery?

40:24.950 --> 40:27.870
I was in the van when you all
rushed in and dragged me down here.

40:30.070 --> 40:31.070
Are you sure about that?

40:31.990 --> 40:34.150
He said the security cameras were off.

40:37.190 --> 40:39.190
You are very good at
controlling with your words.

40:39.550 --> 40:42.190
Except you did make
that one little mistake.

40:42.990 --> 40:44.110
I made a mistake?

40:44.230 --> 40:45.990
Yeah, you told me that you Googled me.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.390
How is that a mistake?

40:48.510 --> 40:50.886
Well, if you'd have done it between
meeting me and my coming here,

40:50.910 --> 40:53.206
then you would have known that
the guy that shot me is in prison

40:53.230 --> 40:55.190
in The Hague right now.
But since you didn't,

40:55.310 --> 40:56.630
you must have done it months ago,

40:56.670 --> 40:59.270
and that's a long time to
plan at being manipulated.

41:12.710 --> 41:14.910
You think you're a
shit-hot computer guy, huh?

41:16.830 --> 41:17.990
I caught Ghost Zero.

41:18.550 --> 41:21.710
Though I did think you'd
be a bit more... impressive.

41:23.870 --> 41:25.350
If I were Ghost Zero,

41:26.390 --> 41:29.350
I would certainly have nothing
to fear from a tool of the state.

41:29.750 --> 41:32.630
If I were Ghost Zero, someone
like you could never beat me.

41:33.510 --> 41:36.190
The hacking itself, once I
figured out what you were doing,

41:36.710 --> 41:38.670
is almost... amateurish.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.711
What made you special was the
fact that you left no trace.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.550
Ah, the impossible act.

41:45.470 --> 41:46.870
Ah, keep smiling.

41:48.230 --> 41:50.910
You know you can never prove I had
anything to do with that robbery.

41:51.350 --> 41:52.550
I was two blocks away.

41:52.830 --> 41:56.310
Yeah, in a van from which
you attempted to override

41:56.430 --> 41:59.110
every security and CCTV system in the bank.

41:59.430 --> 42:02.510
Plus, you used your own cell
phone to call the guard inside.

42:02.830 --> 42:03.990
What do you mean "attempted."

42:07.390 --> 42:09.750
I took over every system an
hour before you got there,

42:10.550 --> 42:12.910
dropped a veil over them
to make them look untouched.

42:13.550 --> 42:14.870
Guess where I learned that from?

42:15.190 --> 42:18.750
A duplicate of the operating system
made just before I did anything.

42:19.390 --> 42:22.510
If you looked at it, you would
never know anyone had been there.

42:24.430 --> 42:26.070
After I finish documenting this,

42:26.190 --> 42:29.470
I will see that it becomes standard
protocol for all cyber investigators

42:29.990 --> 42:32.950
to check a system they believe
has been compromised to insure

42:33.230 --> 42:36.190
they're looking at the actual
bios, not just a duplicate cover.

42:38.430 --> 42:41.350
Your game, as they say, is up.

42:46.790 --> 42:48.430
Nothing that you've said convicts me.

42:48.590 --> 42:50.870
- No, my testimony will convict you.
- Why?

42:51.030 --> 42:51.750
Why?

42:51.870 --> 42:53.206
Why would you want to put me away?

42:53.230 --> 42:55.630
I haven't hurt anyone. It was just a lark.

42:55.790 --> 42:58.230
- A bit of fun in a boring life.
- A lark?

42:58.550 --> 43:00.590
Six people have died, a police officer,

43:00.950 --> 43:02.950
and a friend of mine
wounded, all because what?

43:03.070 --> 43:04.190
What, 'cause you were bored?

43:04.470 --> 43:05.950
None of that was because I was bored.

43:06.190 --> 43:09.430
Wanting to see if you could figure
it out was because I was bored.

43:09.590 --> 43:12.870
The NYPD has a nickname for people
like you, it's called "whackjob".

43:16.470 --> 43:18.990
But like I said, I found it
interesting talking to you.

43:19.830 --> 43:21.590
But all good things must come to an end.

43:21.710 --> 43:22.950
Oh, so, you wanted me out here?

43:24.590 --> 43:26.790
You won't be testifying
against me, Detective.

43:27.510 --> 43:29.150
You won't be testifying against anyone.

43:29.510 --> 43:31.750
Anna, stop. Let's talk about this.

43:31.910 --> 43:35.790
No. Talking to you has
become really boring.

43:36.830 --> 43:37.830
No!

44:00.230 --> 44:02.590
Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance!

44:03.350 --> 44:04.070
Carl...

44:04.190 --> 44:06.590
What? What? I'm here.

44:07.150 --> 44:10.990
- Tell...
- No, no. You... You tell her, okay?

44:11.510 --> 44:12.950
I'm not scared.

44:13.070 --> 44:15.950
Don't be scared, don't be scared...

44:16.310 --> 44:18.110
- Do you...
- What?

44:19.150 --> 44:21.470
- Do you believe?
- What?

44:21.630 --> 44:24.750
Do you believe I will see him?

44:27.830 --> 44:29.270
- What?
- Do you believe

44:29.910 --> 44:34.390
that I will see Ã‰tienne? My little boy?

44:34.510 --> 44:39.070
You... you hang on. Just hang on. Just...

44:42.550 --> 44:43.270
Do you?

44:43.470 --> 44:46.310
I know it. I know you're going to see him.

44:49.190 --> 44:50.710
Just hang on. Just...

44:52.550 --> 44:55.950
Come on, come on, come on. Shh...

44:56.305 --> 45:02.538
