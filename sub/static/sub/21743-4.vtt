WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:02.439
It was about us. We got on.

00:02.440 --> 00:05.999
But he knows I want kids
eventually, so he said, "Why not?"

00:06.000 --> 00:08.080
I was born here. I grew up here.

00:08.150 --> 00:09.755
My friends are here. My work is here.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.419
There's only one way I'm leaving
now, and that's in a coffin.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.829
That's good to know.

00:13.830 --> 00:16.029
Here. Something for later.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.159
Don't show Simon.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.579
Shut up!

00:20.580 --> 00:23.109
This was a nasty, violent attack.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.779
You told him something, and
now he won't even look at me.

00:27.140 --> 00:29.769
I don't care what you're planning
to hurt me or get rid of me.

00:29.770 --> 00:30.849
We support him.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.989
Together.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.029
Absolutely.

00:36.050 --> 00:38.819
But you said this is my home
now, and you told me about Mum.

00:38.820 --> 00:40.739
You said it's OK because you're here.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.219
- I'll drop your things round later.
- Tom!

00:44.350 --> 00:46.549
Maybe I should go.

00:46.550 --> 00:48.379
I don't want to, but it's probably best.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.079
Well, we could go together.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.239
Mamma!

01:05.540 --> 01:07.509

- Mamma.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.379
Mamma!

01:12.330 --> 01:14.159
- Mamma...
- She wants you.

01:17.820 --> 01:20.679
She's shouting mummy, but
she really means daddy.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.099
Go on! I'm asleep.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.269
I've got to get ready.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.019
Mamma!

01:30.480 --> 01:31.649
Are you OK?

01:36.010 --> 01:37.699
You seem anxious.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.009
Mamma!

01:40.510 --> 01:42.619
I'm just thinking about Tom.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.159
We couldn't have him in the house.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.429
Not after everything.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.149
I know.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.569
I'll give it a couple of
weeks, then make contact.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.699
Check he's OK.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.509
She's gone.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.669
That's the main thing, right?

01:57.670 --> 01:59.259
She's out of our lives.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.569
We can relax.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.309
Mamma!

02:05.450 --> 02:07.739
I'm not anxious. I'm ecstatic.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.509

This is what she wants.

04:31.010 --> 04:33.489
- So you haven't been round there?
- I went to pick up Tom that time.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.269
You went to pick up
Tom, and you got hot...

04:35.270 --> 04:37.519
- I need to go.
- You don't remember taking your clothes off,

04:37.520 --> 04:39.519
- anything like that?
- This is exactly what she's after.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.487
- How did she get it?
- I don't know.

04:41.488 --> 04:43.239
When she was here for the wedding,

04:43.240 --> 04:45.019
or maybe she broke into my office?

04:45.020 --> 04:46.379
Do we even know if she's left?

04:46.380 --> 04:47.879
There's no address on this.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.189
Someone did it for her.

04:49.190 --> 04:51.679
There's a for sale sign
up outside her house.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.509
She's handed in her
resignation at the surgery.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.933
Yes, she's gone. This is a parting shot.

04:55.940 --> 04:57.753
How do you know that there's
a sign up outside her house?

04:57.754 --> 04:59.513
- You went round?
- She sent me a picture of it.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.519
- She sent you a picture?
- Yes, I told you.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.209
Don't let this get in there.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.959
I have to go.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.329
We're good.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.699
I love you.

05:16.990 --> 05:18.729
All done!

05:18.730 --> 05:20.979
- It's fine, yes?
- Yeah.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.279
Want another one?

05:29.280 --> 05:31.339
- Bye, darling.
- See you later.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.204
- Ah!
- Here we are.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.109
Hello! Hello!

06:22.110 --> 06:23.419
Hey, darling. You all right?

06:23.420 --> 06:25.389
She's been a bit grumpy
the past couple of days.

06:25.390 --> 06:27.639
Has she? Oh, well, we'll
look after her, don't worry.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.409
Look, this is a tiger over there. Look!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.689
Are you all right, darling?

06:33.690 --> 06:35.749
Yeah.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.769
- You know Gemma's gone?
- No.

06:39.170 --> 06:42.169
- What, gone?
- Yeah, she moved away with Tom.

06:43.340 --> 06:45.629
Put her house on the
market. Quit her job.

06:46.530 --> 06:47.530
Well...

06:48.830 --> 06:50.049
That's good.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.609
Isn't it?

06:53.610 --> 06:55.249
Yeah.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.419
Yeah, it really is.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.859
Bye, Amelie.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.779
Look, two giraffes!

07:16.540 --> 07:18.969
It's a boutique, on a farm.

07:18.970 --> 07:23.469
You get bored for music, you wander
off into a barn, and do whatever.

07:23.470 --> 07:25.489
You've been away from Amelie before.

07:25.490 --> 07:28.719
- Erm, not for a whole night.
- Well, you should. You're young.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.269
- You're 24.
- 25!

07:31.910 --> 07:33.969
You've got to have your own life.

07:33.970 --> 07:38.099
- You're only going cos you want to get off with Jez.
- No!

07:38.100 --> 07:39.459
That's not the only reason.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.269
Hey!

07:42.270 --> 07:44.049
Carly.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.649
Hey. How's it going?

07:45.650 --> 07:47.049
- Good. You?
- Yeah.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.979
This is my best mate, Kate, by the way.

07:50.430 --> 07:51.459
Hi.

07:53.010 --> 07:54.089
You all right?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.739
- Yep.
- Have you two met?

07:57.740 --> 07:59.009
A long time ago.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.679
I'm in a hurry, so...

08:01.680 --> 08:03.129
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.129
Well, that was awkward.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.349
Carly. Are you doing this for her?

08:10.350 --> 08:12.509
- Doing what for who?
- Gemma.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.789
Watching me, following me like before.

08:15.830 --> 08:19.259
OK, wow. I am actively walking away.

08:19.260 --> 08:22.309
- Do you see this?
- Did we just happen to bump into each other today?

08:22.310 --> 08:23.899
Exactly when she's just...

08:23.900 --> 08:24.950
She's what?

08:24.951 --> 08:27.175
This morning she put a
note through my letterbox.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.949
- Saying what?
- Basically claiming that Simon's slept with her.

08:29.950 --> 08:32.099
- Has he?
- No!

08:32.100 --> 08:35.568
OK. Have you asked him? Cos
you must worry about that.

08:35.570 --> 08:37.208
What?

08:37.210 --> 08:38.708
Once a cheat, always a cheat.

08:38.710 --> 08:41.198
- If a guy's capable of it...
- He wouldn't.

08:43.450 --> 08:46.539
I'd ask him, but you trust him...

08:46.540 --> 08:47.709
It's fine.

08:56.390 --> 08:58.029
What's all that?

08:58.030 --> 09:00.649
- Are we getting lunch or not?
- I have to do something.

09:00.650 --> 09:03.319
- What's the matter with you?
- I'll see you later.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.229
- Hey, Mark. Is he free?
- Yeah.

09:12.230 --> 09:13.539
Do you want me to... ?

09:13.540 --> 09:14.619
No, no. No, it's fine.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.268
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:25.269 --> 09:26.868
- Finished lectures?
- No.

09:29.259 --> 09:32.438
- You want to get some lunch?
- Shall we go to the café?

09:32.439 --> 09:35.538
No, if we go to the café,
you'll just be working, so just...

09:35.539 --> 09:37.978
Bring some sandwiches
up. We'll have them here.

09:37.979 --> 09:39.238
OK. Preferences?

09:40.369 --> 09:41.868
Usual. Chicken, whatever.

09:44.729 --> 09:45.808
One minute.

10:37.459 --> 10:38.958
They'll bring the food.

10:45.719 --> 10:48.148
I feel like now she's gone, we
can really start living here.

10:49.319 --> 10:51.478
- Good, isn't it?
- You're talking about her again.

10:51.479 --> 10:52.698
Well, it's a big deal.

10:53.829 --> 10:55.418
It really does feel different.

10:57.479 --> 10:58.938
Like it's our place now.

11:04.139 --> 11:08.078
If Tom wanted to come back,
would you give him another chance?

11:08.079 --> 11:09.388
- It could be...
- We spoke about this.

11:09.389 --> 11:14.498
- I know you feel guilty.
- He was drunk, and 15, and stupid.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.418
But he's my son.
Imagine if it was Amelie.

11:16.419 --> 11:18.808
No, it's not the same. Shut up!

11:18.809 --> 11:21.058
He's not living with us.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.548
You want to keep having
this conversation?

11:23.549 --> 11:24.768
I dare you.

11:41.589 --> 11:42.668
What's going on?

11:45.349 --> 11:46.848
Why didn't she just tell you?

11:49.279 --> 11:50.878
Gemma. Two years ago.

11:50.879 --> 11:52.748
When she found the photos of us.

11:52.749 --> 11:55.278
I assume she wanted to
understand the extent of it.

11:55.279 --> 11:58.138
Make sure she knew what
was really going on. Hm.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.888
Why is there a picture
of her on your phone?

12:06.859 --> 12:08.778
All dressed up like
she's on a night out.

12:14.499 --> 12:16.518
I looked at your phone when you left,

12:16.519 --> 12:18.858
because it seems as
though I don't trust you.

12:25.609 --> 12:27.718
I'd come out of the
pub, and she was there.

12:27.719 --> 12:29.078
She looked terrible, so...

12:29.079 --> 12:31.758
So you took a picture of
her. And I'm asking why.

12:31.759 --> 12:34.518
I took a picture, and
then I sent it to her.

12:34.519 --> 12:37.568
You've tried answering this question
twice and I still don't understand

12:37.569 --> 12:39.348
why you took the picture of her,

12:39.349 --> 12:41.968
and now I don't understand
why you sent it to her.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.578
To... shame her, I suppose.

12:45.579 --> 12:46.918
To shame her?

12:46.919 --> 12:51.208
She's staggering towards me across
the square like some... zombie.

12:51.209 --> 12:54.958
Like, I don't know, a
drug addict prostitute.

12:54.959 --> 12:57.068
I'm there with Lee, old mates.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.378
She's shouting this stuff.

12:58.379 --> 13:01.378
I thought if I took a
photo, it would shut her up.

13:01.379 --> 13:03.348
And then I thought I'd send it to her

13:03.349 --> 13:05.458
so she could see what she looked like.

13:06.769 --> 13:08.508
- Why do you care so much?
- I...

13:10.419 --> 13:12.908
She's really got you, hasn't she?

13:12.909 --> 13:14.178
The paranoia.

13:16.709 --> 13:17.878
It's simple.

13:19.239 --> 13:21.258
She's gone and that's good.

13:23.129 --> 13:24.398
What?

13:25.519 --> 13:29.128
I'm desperately ignoring the
suspicion that you're lying to me.

13:29.129 --> 13:30.538
I promise I'm not.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.168
Here you go.

13:52.809 --> 13:54.258
Hey.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.698
Oh, it's Sian. I sometimes see you here.

13:59.699 --> 14:01.958
- Simon's friend from uni?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

14:02.159 --> 14:04.578
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks. You?

14:04.579 --> 14:06.218
Oh, busy.

14:06.219 --> 14:07.808
Very busy. We're a doctor down.

14:07.809 --> 14:11.278
- I heard.
- Oh, well, I'm sure you did.

14:11.279 --> 14:13.198
No warning. No notice.

14:13.199 --> 14:15.538
Not helpful, but you
carry on regardless.

14:15.539 --> 14:19.148
- Anyway, I'd better go.
- So she really has gone?

14:19.149 --> 14:22.388
Yes. Suddenly vanished, just
as your husband predicted.

14:22.389 --> 14:24.588
- He predicted?
- Yeah. He said she'd be gone

14:24.589 --> 14:27.448
within a month of him coming
back, and he was right.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.138
How would he know?

14:29.139 --> 14:31.298
Oh, the mysteries of Simon
Foster are never-ending.

14:31.299 --> 14:33.728
As you are no doubt aware.

14:33.729 --> 14:35.278
What?

14:35.279 --> 14:37.018
Oh, God, it's just a joke.

14:39.359 --> 14:41.418
Actually, look...

14:42.499 --> 14:44.558
... I shouldn't have
looked up the details, but,

14:44.559 --> 14:48.218
well, everybody does it, don't
they? Here. It's on with Potters.

14:48.219 --> 14:50.748
Looks quite nice in
the photos, doesn't it?

14:50.749 --> 14:51.918
Quite tempted myself.

14:53.749 --> 14:56.938
Well, not really. SIAN GIGGLES

14:58.859 --> 15:03.028
Anyway... I should be
getting on. I'll see you soon.

15:09.219 --> 15:10.808
The owner needed to move suddenly.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.168
Do you know where she's gone?

15:13.529 --> 15:15.968
Sorry, no. Anyway, kitchen/diner.

15:15.969 --> 15:17.568
Windows out into the good-sized garden,

15:17.569 --> 15:19.018
and dining area through there.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.238
Lots of light.

15:23.239 --> 15:25.768
Nice, big space, and
relatively modern kitchen units.

15:25.769 --> 15:29.518
Although, of course, you may
want to start again, after you...

15:29.519 --> 15:31.018
Plenty of storage.

15:37.249 --> 15:40.068
Shall I leave you to have
a look around yourself?

15:40.069 --> 15:42.828
- Poke about? Any questions, I'll be downstairs.
- Thanks.

16:31.218 --> 16:34.858
_

16:40.739 --> 16:43.358
Oh! Hi. I'm from Potters estate agent.

16:43.359 --> 16:45.468
I'm showing a buyer
around. She's upstairs.

16:47.019 --> 16:48.748
I'm just here to organise...

16:51.239 --> 16:52.318
OK.

16:53.439 --> 16:55.268
A lot of this stuff's being thrown away,

16:55.269 --> 16:56.528
but some of it needs to be kept.

16:56.529 --> 16:59.958
I'm just going to put stickers on
things so they don't get mixed up.

16:59.959 --> 17:01.918
OK.

17:01.919 --> 17:03.328
Kate?

17:04.969 --> 17:06.468
What are you doing here?

17:09.469 --> 17:10.828
Sorry, do you two... ?

17:12.709 --> 17:14.298
Can we have a moment? Sure.

17:23.159 --> 17:24.428
Inquisitive?

17:26.249 --> 17:28.498
Nothing wrong with
that. No need to explain.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.958
Look... I'm moving away.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.286
I've got nothing to lose, so,

17:34.287 --> 17:36.097
- I'm going to tell you what I saw.
- What?

17:36.119 --> 17:38.208
I'm going to tell you what
happened in this room last week.

17:38.209 --> 17:40.688
I was due to come round and
have a glass of wine with Gemma.

17:40.689 --> 17:42.658
We often would have a
glass of wine on a Thursday.

17:42.659 --> 17:45.048
- I need to go.
- I got as far as the door before I heard them,

17:45.049 --> 17:46.548
Gemma and your husband, having sex.

17:46.589 --> 17:50.158
Through there. Just... right there.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.868
This was last Thursday.
Did I mention that?

17:56.259 --> 17:58.458
- Why are you lying for her?
- Exactly.

17:58.459 --> 18:00.478
I have absolutely no
reason to lie for her.

18:03.479 --> 18:06.378
Me and Simon have tried so hard,
but she just won't stop bothering us.

18:06.379 --> 18:09.148
- I'm going to put an end to this.
- How?

18:09.149 --> 18:11.818
- I'm going to tell her.
- But you don't know where she is.

18:12.949 --> 18:14.158
Yes, I do.

18:40.419 --> 18:41.918
Don't spend it all at once.

19:11.819 --> 19:13.938
Hi. I'm looking for a Gemma Foster.

19:13.939 --> 19:15.438
I believe she's staying here.

19:15.439 --> 19:17.118
- Foster?
- Yep.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.898
- No-one under that name.
- Her car's outside.

19:23.499 --> 19:25.048
I'll just call her.

19:48.439 --> 19:50.448
Morning.

19:50.449 --> 19:51.998
- _
- Nappies and early mornings, eh?

19:51.999 --> 19:53.358
It's just like the old days.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.938
- I love it.
- I do all the nappies.

19:55.939 --> 19:58.188
Like I said, it's just like old times.

20:00.349 --> 20:02.128
Come on, Granny. Up you get!

20:04.699 --> 20:06.298
Are you going through the toys?

20:07.989 --> 20:09.808
Just be careful what's in there.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.958
She's only two. We don't
want anything too violent.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.438
Get rid of the soldiers.

20:15.439 --> 20:16.888
Andrew never had soldiers.

20:16.889 --> 20:18.998
It was all about aliens.

20:18.999 --> 20:22.518
Big ones, small ones,
ones with 12 heads.

20:22.519 --> 20:25.188
_

20:25.189 --> 20:27.068
Anything odd-looking, he was happy.

20:28.289 --> 20:30.908
Bit like his girlfriends!

20:32.319 --> 20:33.768
Oh, come on, that was funny.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.038
- Who's that?
- Hm?

20:38.039 --> 20:40.608
Oh, no-one. Nothing. It's just junk.

20:41.610 --> 20:43.848
- Ah!
- Look at...

20:43.849 --> 20:46.938
- Look at your hat!
- Ha-ha-ha.

20:46.939 --> 20:50.508
What's this down here?
Yes! Look at the tiger!

20:52.759 --> 20:55.188
- You all right, darling?
- Yeah.

20:55.189 --> 20:56.928
You know Gemma's gone?

20:56.929 --> 20:59.648
No. What, gone?

20:59.649 --> 21:01.288
Yeah. She moved away with Tom,

21:01.289 --> 21:03.258
put her house on the
market, quit her job.

21:04.289 --> 21:06.408
Oh. Right.

21:06.959 --> 21:08.458
Well...

21:09.729 --> 21:11.128
... that's good.

21:11.129 --> 21:13.008
Isn't it?

21:13.009 --> 21:15.298
Yeah. Yeah, it really is.

21:17.269 --> 21:19.601
- Bye, Amelie.
- Come on, then.

21:19.602 --> 21:21.022
- Bye-bye.
- Let's take that coat off.

21:21.023 --> 21:22.378
- Come on.
- Have a good day.

21:31.339 --> 21:34.008
What else have we got
here? Let's have a look.

21:34.009 --> 21:35.128
There's a giraffe.

21:35.129 --> 21:38.099
_

21:51.489 --> 21:52.618
You look older.

21:55.249 --> 21:56.648
I didn't think you'd come.

21:58.899 --> 22:02.415
What you did at that
dinner was appalling.

22:02.456 --> 22:05.375
But you're not the first woman
I've met who's been cheated on.

22:05.376 --> 22:07.015
It does things to you. I know that.

22:09.176 --> 22:10.575
What is this about?

22:11.986 --> 22:13.855
You love your daughter, don't you?

22:13.856 --> 22:15.925
You'd do anything for her.

22:15.926 --> 22:18.735
So many ambitions and hopes.

22:18.736 --> 22:21.175
Hours put in trying to
keep her on the right track.

22:21.176 --> 22:23.325
Yes. We're very proud of her.

22:25.576 --> 22:28.155
What was she like, as a girl?

22:28.156 --> 22:30.175
What did she want to do?

22:33.126 --> 22:34.205
She wanted to travel.

22:35.326 --> 22:38.615
She used to cut pictures out of
magazines and put them on her wall.

22:38.616 --> 22:40.205
All different countries.

22:40.206 --> 22:42.175
She had a list of places
she wanted to go to,

22:42.176 --> 22:43.485
things she was going to do.

22:43.486 --> 22:45.505
Did she go to those
countries and do those things?

22:46.866 --> 22:50.475
- No, not yet.
- Because her life took a different direction.

22:50.476 --> 22:51.735
Yes.

22:53.096 --> 22:54.455
And she wants to go into business?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.705
- That's right.
- I think she'd do very well.

22:56.706 --> 22:59.185
- We hope so.
- As long as nothing gets in her way.

23:02.146 --> 23:04.955
She's very happy here at the moment.

23:08.946 --> 23:10.305
I'm going to tell you something.

23:11.616 --> 23:14.195
When I say it, you're going
to know it's the truth,

23:14.196 --> 23:16.065
cos it concerns your
daughter's happiness,

23:16.066 --> 23:19.915
so I think your instinct will kick
in and you'll sense I'm not lying.

23:21.506 --> 23:23.845
You'll want to do the right thing.

23:23.846 --> 23:25.065
What?

23:33.276 --> 23:34.815
- Hi.
- Hey, Mark.

23:36.596 --> 23:38.565
Was Kate all right earlier?

23:38.566 --> 23:40.205
- Yeah.
- She wasn't here long.

23:40.206 --> 23:42.695
- Quick lunch.
- Oh. She seemed upset.

23:44.096 --> 23:46.395
- Absolutely fine.
- You sure?

23:46.396 --> 23:47.995
Yeah.

23:47.996 --> 23:49.585
All right.

24:06.136 --> 24:08.245
- I thought you'd...
- Last chance.

24:08.246 --> 24:10.305
- I'm sorry?
- Things are about to go wrong for you.

24:11.476 --> 24:14.385
If you don't pack up and leave
today, I'll destroy everything.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.325
I want to give you the opportunity
to make the right decision.

24:18.326 --> 24:21.135
You threaten me again,
I'll call the police.

24:21.136 --> 24:22.585
- Is that a no?
- How's Tom?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.465
- Is he OK?
- Are you saying it's a no?

24:24.466 --> 24:25.965
Of course it's a fucking no.

24:38.386 --> 24:40.075
Kate.

24:40.076 --> 24:41.805
Mum?

24:41.806 --> 24:45.085
Gemma's told us something... upsetting,

24:45.086 --> 24:46.825
and... we believe her.

24:47.906 --> 24:49.215
This is an ambush.

24:49.216 --> 24:50.924
- No, darling.
- His tie,

24:50.925 --> 24:54.075
the address in your room,
the other doctor, Carly,

24:54.086 --> 24:56.245
your friend Anna. Why do any of it?

24:56.246 --> 24:57.605
You're actually insane.

24:57.606 --> 24:59.055
So I've had some time.

24:59.056 --> 25:01.215
I've checked whose name
your house is registered in.

25:01.216 --> 25:02.681
- It's yours, not Simon's.
- So?

25:02.682 --> 25:03.682
I assume your parents paid for it,

25:03.686 --> 25:05.485
which means they don't trust him.

25:05.486 --> 25:07.495
- What have you told her?
- We haven't told her anything.

25:07.496 --> 25:09.375
I also checked who owns
the Courtyard project.

25:09.376 --> 25:10.825
That's in Mark's name, your godfather,

25:10.826 --> 25:12.745
so he clearly doesn't trust Simon.

25:12.746 --> 25:15.325
Nobody does, with anything,
except you, and even you,

25:15.326 --> 25:16.735
I assume there's a pre-nup?

25:16.736 --> 25:19.405
Sweetheart. She told us something and...

25:20.576 --> 25:23.955
- ... it's about Simon.
- That he slept with her?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.315
Huh...

25:25.316 --> 25:27.235
You're really telling everyone this?

25:27.236 --> 25:29.105
Don't you find that demeaning?

25:29.106 --> 25:31.315
Even if it was true,
don't you have any shame?

25:31.316 --> 25:33.135
You wouldn't be here if you trusted him.

25:33.136 --> 25:35.105
Kate, we really think
there's something in it.

25:35.106 --> 25:36.895
Mum, she is mad. If
it actually happened,

25:36.896 --> 25:40.035
she would just call me and tell
me, but she arranges this huge plan.

25:40.036 --> 25:42.895
She said that Simon came
round to hers and that they...

25:42.896 --> 25:43.925
He hates her.

25:45.096 --> 25:46.595
Everything he had of the two of them.

25:46.596 --> 25:48.235
- He's thrown it all away.
- No, he hasn't.

25:48.236 --> 25:49.685
He would never touch her.

25:51.986 --> 25:53.905
Do you have any proof?

25:53.906 --> 25:56.295
- No.
- Then I don't want to hear it.

25:56.296 --> 25:58.225
Why do you believe her?

25:58.226 --> 26:00.090
- You want to believe it?
- Course we don't.

26:00.091 --> 26:01.135
Dad does.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.125
I can't believe you brought Amelie.

26:04.126 --> 26:07.035
We wanted to know more
about what this was.

26:07.036 --> 26:08.485
She told us to meet her here.

26:08.486 --> 26:10.799
I didn't realise she'd
asked you to come too.

26:10.826 --> 26:13.339
Kate, there are things that I could
tell you that we did that night

26:13.340 --> 26:16.505
that I'm sure you don't want
laid out in front of your parents.

26:16.506 --> 26:19.315
- Intimate details, of things that he said about...
- Gemma, I know.

26:21.756 --> 26:24.095
I know he slept with you last week.

26:24.096 --> 26:25.595
The only reason I tried to hide it

26:25.596 --> 26:27.285
was because if Dad or Mark found out,

26:27.286 --> 26:30.665
then they might take everything
away from us. But I know he did it.

26:32.726 --> 26:33.765
He told me.

26:34.836 --> 26:38.205
It was a mistake. And we'll get
through it because we're strong.

26:38.206 --> 26:40.275
So all this is a waste of time.

26:40.276 --> 26:41.675
Our marriage is a marriage.

26:41.676 --> 26:43.595
But it doesn't make sense. If you...

26:43.596 --> 26:45.985
if you already knew,
then why are you here?

26:45.986 --> 26:50.255
Because I wanted to see how much
you were prepared to demean yourself.

26:50.256 --> 26:51.845
Turns out quite a long way.

26:55.176 --> 26:57.715
This was it? Your big plan?

26:59.356 --> 27:02.265
He messed up, and he's
sorry, but he told me.

27:02.666 --> 27:04.175
So everything's all right at work, yeah?

27:04.176 --> 27:05.585
Mark says he's working hard.

27:05.586 --> 27:07.315
- Yeah.
- Right then.

27:07.316 --> 27:10.035
So we don't have to change anything.

27:10.036 --> 27:11.165
It's all good.

27:12.806 --> 27:16.745
Never come near my family
or my daughter ever again.

27:16.746 --> 27:17.865
Your plan's failed.

27:19.176 --> 27:20.635
Simon's right. Just go away.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.455
So? What's going on?

28:42.766 --> 28:45.015
I thought you were
sorting everything out.

28:45.016 --> 28:46.325
Isobel received your apology.

28:46.326 --> 28:48.205
School are aware of that.

28:48.206 --> 28:50.265
And I appealed your exclusion.

28:51.956 --> 28:54.625
In my experience, the
governors are fair, so...

28:56.216 --> 28:57.625
... we'll have to wait and see.

28:59.036 --> 29:00.535
OK.

29:00.536 --> 29:01.795
But what about Dad?

29:01.796 --> 29:04.615
The only reason we came back was
cos you said you could sort him out.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.255
I thought I had a way to get
rid of him, but it hasn't worked.

29:10.616 --> 29:11.975
So we have to leave?

29:11.976 --> 29:13.005
No, we don't have to.

29:14.126 --> 29:15.535
But if you want all this to stop,

29:15.576 --> 29:18.255
and if you really don't want
to see him again, then...

29:21.766 --> 29:24.295
... yeah. We should.

30:00.346 --> 30:01.475
That photo of Gemma...

30:03.256 --> 30:04.845
... must have seemed strange.

30:06.776 --> 30:07.945
Yeah, it did.

30:10.056 --> 30:11.175
Forgive me?

30:16.476 --> 30:17.975
How was uni?

30:20.176 --> 30:22.055
We're doing well at work.

30:22.056 --> 30:23.885
Wendy's still a pain.

30:23.886 --> 30:25.615
Mark says we have to be patient.

30:25.616 --> 30:28.245
Three months, apparently,
for someone to settle in.

30:28.246 --> 30:29.975
Seems a bit long to me.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.525
You...

30:35.936 --> 30:39.215
You hear anything from Gemma today
after the tie this morning... ?

30:39.216 --> 30:40.385
Have you?

30:44.976 --> 30:47.505
How did she keep it from you
for so long? I don't understand.

30:47.506 --> 30:48.915
Well, she's psychopathic.

30:48.916 --> 30:50.795
Well, I can't even
do it for two minutes.

30:52.056 --> 30:54.545
- What?
- Yes, I saw her today.

30:54.546 --> 30:57.115
You... did? When?

30:57.116 --> 30:58.855
She tried to get the better of me.

30:59.936 --> 31:01.195
But I said to her...

31:02.886 --> 31:06.165
... I told her I already knew
you two slept together last week.

31:09.026 --> 31:11.985
That you'd been honest about
it and we'd worked through it.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.075
I really wish you had.

31:15.076 --> 31:16.995
I don't know what lies
she's been feeding you...

31:16.996 --> 31:19.245
I wanted you to look honest
in front of Dad as well.

31:19.302 --> 31:21.581
He was there. He won't tell Mark.

31:21.592 --> 31:23.101
Wh... ? Kate, she's lying.

31:23.102 --> 31:25.071
Don't make the same mistake twice.

31:27.882 --> 31:29.241
Just stop.

31:29.242 --> 31:31.161
Think it through.

31:32.572 --> 31:34.721
Work out the consequences of lying

31:34.722 --> 31:37.071
and the consequences
of telling the truth.

31:38.472 --> 31:41.521
Believe me when I say, if
you have slept with her,

31:41.522 --> 31:44.051
I will hate every bit of you,

31:44.052 --> 31:46.218
but it will be nothing
compared to my reaction

31:46.219 --> 31:48.278
if you now lie to me as well.

31:50.719 --> 31:53.528
See if you can do the
calculation as to what's best.

32:12.469 --> 32:15.468
She said it was last Thursday,

32:15.469 --> 32:17.478
when you told me you were working late.

32:20.859 --> 32:22.878
You went over there, in
the middle of everything

32:22.879 --> 32:25.168
that was going on with
Tom, and just did it.

32:28.359 --> 32:29.948
As basic as that.

32:34.309 --> 32:36.468
Thursday night around, what, 9ish?

32:36.469 --> 32:39.238
You got your cock out and
you put it in her. Yeah?

32:59.959 --> 33:01.078
Yes.

33:04.499 --> 33:06.378
Then you lied to me.

33:06.379 --> 33:09.238
- I couldn't bring myself...
- Was it good?

33:09.239 --> 33:11.108
It's entirely my fault.

33:11.109 --> 33:13.128
Of course it is. Who
else's fault would it be?

33:14.439 --> 33:15.848
She came on to me.

33:15.849 --> 33:17.208
Did Tom find out?

33:19.219 --> 33:21.188
Is that why he was like that?

33:23.159 --> 33:25.178
I feel genuinely sorry for him.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.018
Was it good?

33:29.019 --> 33:30.288
Does that matter?

33:30.289 --> 33:33.008
- The quality.
- The competition with her.

33:33.009 --> 33:34.318
You know what? It really does.

33:34.319 --> 33:36.188
OK, yes, it was very good.

33:36.189 --> 33:39.288
It was the kind of sex she
and I have that I missed.

33:39.289 --> 33:42.098
Right. But seconds into it,
I started thinking of you,

33:42.099 --> 33:46.038
because your body's better,
what you can do with it.

33:46.039 --> 33:48.658
You smell better. You're kinder.

33:48.659 --> 33:52.128
I get much more pleasure
from you in every way.

33:52.129 --> 33:55.368
Starting sex with her
was driven by lust, yes,

33:55.369 --> 33:57.988
but finishing it was politeness.

33:57.989 --> 34:00.848
If there was a competition, if
that's what we're talking about,

34:00.849 --> 34:02.958
you would win in every single category.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.268
I think you know that's the truth.

34:04.269 --> 34:06.428
- You still have feelings for her.
- No...

34:06.429 --> 34:07.838
You must do if you...

34:07.839 --> 34:11.068
I had a physical, sexual response
to her, but I don't want her.

34:11.069 --> 34:14.068
I can't bear to be around her.

34:14.069 --> 34:16.838
Just sex. It meant nothing.

34:16.839 --> 34:18.007
Bad sex.

34:28.789 --> 34:30.197
I'm so sorry.

34:32.958 --> 34:34.277
When did she tell you?

34:37.228 --> 34:40.138
She had people follow me.
Tell me things about you.

34:40.139 --> 34:41.777
What things?

34:41.779 --> 34:45.428
That if you'd cheated once, that
you'd do it again, all of that.

34:45.429 --> 34:49.697
And then suddenly she was there,
with Mum and Dad and Amelie.

34:49.699 --> 34:52.139
- What?
- She got them to come to, I don't know...

34:52.141 --> 34:54.288
shame me, I suppose.

34:54.289 --> 34:55.800
- Where is she?
- No.

34:55.801 --> 34:57.864
- Tell me where she is.
- It doesn't matter where she is, Simon!

34:57.865 --> 34:59.168
I'm here!

35:06.619 --> 35:07.888
Sorry. I'm sorry.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.658
Sleep in the spare room tonight.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.118
No problem.

35:20.119 --> 35:23.218
When are you going to
stop making mistakes?

35:23.219 --> 35:24.718
Now.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.128
Are you all right?

35:39.949 --> 35:41.688
OK, I'm coming in.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.298
Mum...

36:00.299 --> 36:02.778
- I've done it before.
- Yeah, when I was a kid.

36:05.929 --> 36:07.658
You're still a kid.

36:44.039 --> 36:46.758
Vince Cable is favourite
to replace Tim Farron

36:46.759 --> 36:48.118
as Lib Dem leader...

36:59.179 --> 37:00.488
Thank you.

37:02.369 --> 37:03.538
What for?

37:04.659 --> 37:05.928
Telling the truth.

37:07.199 --> 37:09.488
I know that can't
have been easy for you.

37:17.509 --> 37:19.238
I'm not going to do what she did.

37:21.349 --> 37:23.228
Shout at you, get angry.

37:25.849 --> 37:27.308
We have a daughter.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.528
We have to get through this.

37:35.229 --> 37:37.008
I want to.

37:41.279 --> 37:43.148
Give me time.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.198
Yeah.

37:48.639 --> 37:49.948
Thanks.

38:40.719 --> 38:45.358
You know you keep asking why I
went to live with Dad? What he said?

38:45.359 --> 38:46.718
Yeah?

38:46.719 --> 38:49.858
Well, it doesn't matter
now. So can we leave it?

38:52.629 --> 38:54.168
OK.

38:58.949 --> 39:01.298
What was your problem with James?

39:01.299 --> 39:04.208
He was wrong for you.
You didn't work together.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.518
I liked him.

39:05.519 --> 39:06.878
Well, you're stupid.

39:10.959 --> 39:12.968
Do you think Dad's happy now?

39:12.969 --> 39:16.108
Now that we've had to
leave? Like he wanted?

39:18.549 --> 39:20.608
- It's unfair.
- I did my best.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.518
I know.

39:25.909 --> 39:27.968
I'm next door if you need me.

40:07.399 --> 40:09.978
You said he didn't
throw everything away.

40:09.979 --> 40:11.518
What did you mean?

40:13.349 --> 40:16.258
That watch he wears...
I chose it for him.

40:16.259 --> 40:18.368
- He bought that before he met you.
- He's lying.

40:18.369 --> 40:20.098
The cufflinks he wore
for your wedding day

40:20.099 --> 40:22.538
were a seventh anniversary gift from me.

40:22.539 --> 40:24.598
- He's forgotten.
- No.

40:24.599 --> 40:26.568
There are things of
ours all over your house.

40:26.569 --> 40:28.547
Place mats, art on the walls.

40:28.548 --> 40:30.657
He also said he dreams about me.

40:30.658 --> 40:33.047
- He can't stand you.
- So there's two possibilities.

40:33.048 --> 40:34.687
That either I'm a pathological liar

40:34.688 --> 40:36.557
who's prepared to destroy my son's life,

40:36.558 --> 40:39.697
and your daughter's life,
for some sort of revenge,

40:39.698 --> 40:43.167
or your husband is a man who
has been hiding himself from you

40:43.168 --> 40:45.847
ever since the day you first met.

40:45.848 --> 40:47.527
Yeah.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.687
So, which is it?

40:49.688 --> 40:51.187
Cos that's why you're here.

40:51.188 --> 40:52.737
You don't know.

40:55.318 --> 40:56.717
Do you?

41:03.708 --> 41:05.067
What are you doing?

41:06.518 --> 41:08.297
Trying to give you an
answer. Come with me.

41:09.608 --> 41:10.687
Where?

41:10.688 --> 41:12.047
Home.

41:22.358 --> 41:26.767
You could accept that he had a
one-night stand, even with me.

41:26.768 --> 41:29.577
But the problem is you're starting
to think it's more than that.

41:29.578 --> 41:31.457
That his feelings run deeper.

41:31.458 --> 41:32.767
I just want an end to this.

41:32.768 --> 41:35.397
I noticed the canapés
at your wedding...

41:35.398 --> 41:37.787
they were small versions of Thai food.

41:37.788 --> 41:40.787
- You both like it?
- Yeah. Thai food, that's our thing.

41:40.788 --> 41:42.937
And the song at the wedding,
I saw you dancing to it.

41:42.938 --> 41:44.487
- Jimmy Cliff.
- Yeah.

41:44.488 --> 41:47.347
Well, that was always
our food, he knows that.

41:47.348 --> 41:50.257
Jimmy Cliff wasn't our first
dance, but it was my favourite.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.977
We played it when we had
sex on our wedding night.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.847
You just don't stop lying, do you?

41:54.848 --> 41:56.627
OK, maybe it's a coincidence.

41:56.628 --> 41:58.407
How does he bring you off?

41:58.408 --> 41:59.907
- What?
- When we first did it,

41:59.908 --> 42:02.257
he used to just bang
away and get nowhere near.

42:02.258 --> 42:04.507
So I taught him. Bet
he does that to you now.

42:04.508 --> 42:07.367
I'm just guessing, but I saw
the vibrator in your drawer.

42:08.908 --> 42:10.367
Does he close his eyes?

42:10.368 --> 42:12.007
- Jesus...
- It's worried you.

42:12.008 --> 42:13.457
That he's thinking of someone else.

42:15.098 --> 42:16.787
My piece of paper I gave you,

42:16.788 --> 42:19.410
I just did it to wind you up,
really, but did you read it?

42:19.411 --> 42:20.684
- Yeah.
- Do you know what it was?

42:20.685 --> 42:22.787
- I guessed.
- His speech to me at our wedding.

42:22.788 --> 42:24.847
And really, you know, that says it all.

42:24.848 --> 42:27.947
"She will be everything for ever.

42:27.948 --> 42:29.917
My obsession, my life.

42:29.918 --> 42:32.117
There will never be anyone else.

42:32.158 --> 42:34.977
And she will be my life
until the day I die."

42:34.978 --> 42:37.177
He's stuck to that promise.

42:37.178 --> 42:39.477
The obsession, the passion,
it's all still true.

42:39.478 --> 42:41.257
He can't stop thinking about me,

42:41.258 --> 42:43.507
that's why he's so
desperate to destroy me.

42:44.818 --> 42:46.087
Kate...

42:47.778 --> 42:48.897
... I'm not the liar.

42:50.158 --> 42:52.787
I'm a very normal woman
who won't let him win.

42:56.358 --> 42:58.507
Simon took it, year after we met.

43:00.618 --> 43:04.137
And when I saw you standing
there, it all made sense.

43:07.278 --> 43:10.277
He used to love my tight jeans
and the boots, it turned him on.

43:11.868 --> 43:15.297
Coincidence. Jeans and
boots aren't unusual.

43:15.298 --> 43:18.717
If you want one thing that will
prove this to you, I don't have it,

43:18.718 --> 43:20.867
but it's the whole
thing with coming back...

43:20.868 --> 43:22.327
the big house, the swagger.

43:22.328 --> 43:23.684
I'm sorry. I'm...

43:25.085 --> 43:26.585
I'm so sorry.

43:26.918 --> 43:30.907
I honestly wish it wasn't,
but it's all for my benefit.

43:32.158 --> 43:34.517
Every time you've asked
him if your jeans look good,

43:34.518 --> 43:37.467
every time he's complimented you
on your hair in the last two years,

43:37.468 --> 43:39.627
how conscious it is, I don't know,

43:39.628 --> 43:42.627
but it's his taste, and his taste is me.

44:12.068 --> 44:15.017
It won't feel like it,
but tonight's a good night.

44:19.138 --> 44:21.207
You're not going to waste 15 years.

44:22.988 --> 44:24.817
And you're not going
to bring your child up

44:24.818 --> 44:26.407
with a man who will damage her.

44:30.068 --> 44:31.847
Tonight's when you escape.

44:41.148 --> 44:44.770
_

45:12.248 --> 45:14.200
_

45:21.950 --> 45:23.501
_

45:28.338 --> 45:32.977
Thank you for holding.
You are 12th in the...

45:32.978 --> 45:34.757
Wendy?

45:34.758 --> 45:36.727
Bank statements, last few months.

45:36.728 --> 45:38.647
- No problem.
- Can you get Mark?

45:38.648 --> 45:40.567
Oh, he's not here.

45:40.568 --> 45:42.447
- Not here?
- Not been in all day.

45:42.448 --> 45:45.067
- Why not?
- I don't know, I haven't heard.

45:45.108 --> 45:47.457
But I thought he must
be... Did you call him?

45:47.458 --> 45:48.817
I couldn't get through.

45:48.818 --> 45:51.307
Well, can you track him down, please?

45:51.308 --> 45:52.807
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

45:57.070 --> 46:00.300
_

46:10.058 --> 46:12.397
Hi, leave a message.

46:12.398 --> 46:16.717
It's me. You can't just send a text
like that without any explanation.

46:16.718 --> 46:20.557
I don't know what's happening,
I don't know if you guys are OK.

46:20.558 --> 46:22.057
I'm nearly home, call me back.

46:23.558 --> 46:24.917
Love you.

46:44.278 --> 46:45.827
What's going on? What are you doing?

46:45.828 --> 46:47.557
- My job.
- Put it down!

46:47.558 --> 46:49.667
- Speak to the boss, mate.
- I am the boss!

46:49.668 --> 46:52.017
- I don't think so.
- Happy day!

46:52.018 --> 46:54.727
- What's going on?
- The day I've been waiting for.

46:54.728 --> 46:58.857
- When you fuck up and we fuck off.
- What are you talking about?

46:58.858 --> 47:00.377
Gemma's explained
what you've been up to.

47:00.378 --> 47:01.847
She... No, Kate...

47:01.948 --> 47:05.097
It was made very clear to you
from the beginning that all this,

47:05.138 --> 47:07.947
this whole life, is my daughter's.

47:07.948 --> 47:10.667
And you get to live in
it while she's happy.

47:10.668 --> 47:13.437
The moment she's not, it snaps back

47:13.438 --> 47:16.717
and here it is, fucking snapping.

47:16.718 --> 47:18.077
Happy day!

47:21.268 --> 47:22.577
Where've you been?

47:22.578 --> 47:24.777
Oh, come on. Even you must
get what's going on by now.

47:24.778 --> 47:28.017
- We're done.
- But, mate, we've just opened!

47:28.018 --> 47:30.457
Kate's upset, I know,
but we can't just stop.

47:30.458 --> 47:32.707
We're not stopping. I set
it up to run fine without you

47:32.708 --> 47:33.877
in case you did drop out,

47:33.878 --> 47:36.457
which I'm reliably informed you have.

47:36.458 --> 47:40.437
Thanks. It was a great idea, but
beyond that, I don't need you.

47:40.438 --> 47:41.747
Hey, Kyle.

47:42.828 --> 47:45.037
Wait, no! Just stop!

47:45.038 --> 47:47.467
- Mark, mate...
- We're not mates!

47:47.468 --> 47:49.487
I've known you for,
what, about ten minutes?

47:49.488 --> 47:50.847
My bag's in the car, my laptop!

47:50.848 --> 47:52.857
Who owns the bag? Me.

47:52.858 --> 47:55.207
Who bought your fucking laptop? Him.

47:55.208 --> 47:57.127
I'm just doing my best, trying to...

47:57.128 --> 47:58.817
- Said he was a prize bull-shitter.
- You did.

47:58.818 --> 48:00.317
Told you to keep an eye
on the amount of crap

48:00.318 --> 48:02.237
- that comes out of his mouth.
- It's a remarkable amount.

48:02.238 --> 48:04.067
That's why me and Mark
got on so well at school.

48:04.108 --> 48:06.647
I spoke a load of crap,
he'd spot it a mile off.

48:06.648 --> 48:08.517
- Kept me sane all these years.
- Chris, please...

48:08.518 --> 48:10.023
I've had enough.

48:10.024 --> 48:13.683
You stand further away from now on.

48:13.684 --> 48:15.323
She's my daughter!

48:19.394 --> 48:20.753
Here's your stuff.

48:22.684 --> 48:24.503
Mum, can you put her in the car, please?

48:24.504 --> 48:26.853
No! No, you're not taking
her. You're not taking her.

48:26.854 --> 48:28.963
- Mum, now, please.
- Hello, darling. Come here. Hello!

48:28.964 --> 48:31.023
Don't touch her! If you
want an explanation from me,

48:31.024 --> 48:32.473
let my mum put her in the car now.

48:32.474 --> 48:34.633
It's all right, love,
I'll see you in a minute.

48:34.634 --> 48:35.993
I thought we'd dealt with this.

48:35.994 --> 48:38.523
I might not be a doctor,
but I'm pretty clever, Simon.

48:38.524 --> 48:40.773
What did you think would
happen, that I wouldn't find out?

48:40.774 --> 48:42.183
Find out what?

48:42.184 --> 48:44.522
Last night, we decided
we'd work through it.

48:44.523 --> 48:45.693
-  I was honest!
- Honest?

48:45.694 --> 48:48.323
You said it was just sex,
nothing more, but this?

48:48.324 --> 48:49.913
This was all for her, isn't it?

48:49.914 --> 48:51.513
- All of it.
- What do you mean?

48:51.514 --> 48:54.743
The flowers you sent her
with that note, that was you.

48:54.744 --> 48:57.883
- It was a joke.
- No! You text her all the time.

48:57.884 --> 49:00.513
The song for our wedding
dance is her favourite song...

49:00.514 --> 49:02.663
- What?
- All the things you kept of hers.

49:02.664 --> 49:04.163
I've no idea what you're talking about.

49:04.164 --> 49:06.843
Even how I'm dressed now is exactly
like her, like she used to be.

49:06.844 --> 49:08.763
She showed me a photo,
it's exactly the same.

49:08.764 --> 49:10.593
- Kate...
- You dream about her.

49:10.594 --> 49:12.637
- She was my wife for 15 years!
- So?

49:12.638 --> 49:13.838
- So...
- So, yes.

49:13.964 --> 49:15.843
- Kate!
- There it is! That's the "yes" there!

49:15.844 --> 49:17.103
- You knew the deal.
- Kate...

49:17.104 --> 49:19.023
That was your one and last chance.

49:19.064 --> 49:20.713
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah, thanks.

49:21.884 --> 49:23.813
It was all there.

49:23.814 --> 49:25.313
Mark and Dad are helping us.

49:25.314 --> 49:27.743
You just had to manage
being normal for two years.

49:27.744 --> 49:30.603
Making a go of it. It
all could have been yours.

49:30.604 --> 49:32.813
The house, the business,
everything you ever wanted.

49:32.814 --> 49:35.293
You just had to love
me and your daughter,

49:35.294 --> 49:37.643
- and not fuck it up for two years.
- Since we've been back...

49:37.644 --> 49:40.403
Dad always said you would,
and I told him he was wrong.

49:40.404 --> 49:41.673
I'm sorry.

49:43.214 --> 49:44.673
You're never going to see me again.

49:44.674 --> 49:47.203
- Come on.
- You're never going to see Amelie again.

49:47.204 --> 49:48.893
We're all moving to France.

49:48.894 --> 49:49.999
To a house there.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.503
And we'll hire very
expensive lawyers to explain

49:52.504 --> 49:55.453
to anyone who needs to know why she
is growing up without her father.

49:55.454 --> 49:57.893
- You... You can't!
- Dad had all this ready to go

49:57.894 --> 50:00.893
because he loves me and
protects me and he knew.

50:00.894 --> 50:03.513
I'm 25 and he's never let me down.

50:04.834 --> 50:07.313
- Amelie is two, and already, you have.
- We should talk at least.

50:07.314 --> 50:10.033
Is there anything of what
I've just said that isn't true?

50:13.124 --> 50:14.815
- You're obsessed.
- Please, Kate.

50:14.816 --> 50:15.816
Have her.

50:15.824 --> 50:18.563
Please, Kate. Just stop, please.

50:18.564 --> 50:20.113
Please? Stop.

50:20.114 --> 50:22.223
Please, please! Kate, please!

50:22.224 --> 50:25.733
Susie! Susie, for fuck's sake!

50:39.054 --> 50:40.453
Fuck!

50:56.064 --> 50:57.333
Fuck!

51:37.654 --> 51:39.903
It's my daughter.

51:39.904 --> 51:41.543
My family!

51:50.634 --> 51:53.583
My daughter! My family!

51:55.514 --> 51:57.153
What do you want? You want to see?

51:57.154 --> 51:58.743
You want to check it worked?

52:00.714 --> 52:02.443
It worked.

52:33.574 --> 52:34.933
Hello?

52:34.934 --> 52:36.813
It's finished. We can go home.

52:38.544 --> 52:39.713
Tom, it's finished.

52:40.984 --> 52:43.043
What's happened to Dad? Where is he?

52:45.064 --> 52:47.643
- Mum?
- We don't have to worry about Dad any more.

52:47.644 --> 52:48.903
Is he OK?

52:52.464 --> 52:53.923
Mum?!

53:07.324 --> 53:08.973
Tom, actually, I...

53:11.404 --> 53:12.903
I have to call you back.

53:36.114 --> 53:37.893
Is this what you wanted?

53:37.894 --> 53:40.513
I'll put you up in hotel for a few days.

53:40.514 --> 53:42.763
There's a place just on
the outskirts of town.

53:42.764 --> 53:44.123
I've got a room. You can have it.

53:44.124 --> 53:46.233
Just give you a couple of
days to sort something out

53:46.234 --> 53:48.583
- a long way away.
- I don't want your pity.

53:48.584 --> 53:49.843
You haven't got it.

53:49.844 --> 53:51.913
See, the problem is, like
this, you bother me...

53:51.914 --> 53:53.693
I don't know what
you're going to do next.

53:53.694 --> 53:55.843
So I need to know where you
are. Two days in this hotel,

53:55.844 --> 53:58.093
- set something up and go away.
- No.

53:58.094 --> 54:00.113
The business was Mark's.

54:00.114 --> 54:01.893
All the personal stuff
is in Kate's name.

54:01.894 --> 54:03.863
You don't have a house, money, car.

54:03.864 --> 54:05.883
You've just got the
clothes you're wearing

54:05.884 --> 54:09.493
and they would have taken the
shirt off your back if they could.

54:09.494 --> 54:10.853
I will drive you.

54:12.814 --> 54:15.393
- No.
- Stop saying that and think.

54:15.394 --> 54:17.833
- You did this to me.
- Take responsibility.

54:17.834 --> 54:22.103
You took away my wife and
my daughter and my son.

54:22.104 --> 54:24.823
- No, Simon, I didn't do any of that.
- No, no, no!

54:24.824 --> 54:26.833
Your wife and your
daughter have moved away.

54:26.834 --> 54:29.463
- No, no!
- Your mates pretended to like you

54:29.464 --> 54:31.103
when they thought that you were rich,

54:31.104 --> 54:32.643
but I wouldn't count on that now.

54:32.644 --> 54:34.853
Your mother's dead and
you threw your own son out,

54:34.854 --> 54:36.823
so there's nothing left for you here.

54:40.474 --> 54:43.523
- You know, Tom and me...
- You don't know what Tom thinks.

54:43.524 --> 54:45.253
- Yes.
- You're not close to him.

54:45.254 --> 54:47.553
- He's been through a lot.
- He's distant from you.

54:47.554 --> 54:49.193
- Not particularly.
- He should be.

54:53.324 --> 54:54.723
What did you say to him?

54:54.724 --> 54:57.023
- Gemma...
- What have you told him?

55:03.204 --> 55:06.823
Did you promise him you could
sort it all out, fix the problem?

55:06.824 --> 55:08.603
What are you going to say now?

55:08.604 --> 55:11.373
Go on. Go back to wherever you are

55:11.374 --> 55:13.573
and tell him what
you've done to his dad.

55:15.634 --> 55:16.943
You've already lost him.

55:16.944 --> 55:19.763
- What does that mean?
- I made it really clear.

55:19.764 --> 55:21.123
Simon, what have you told him?

55:21.124 --> 55:22.943
Crystal-clear, right from the beginning.

55:22.944 --> 55:25.483
The only way I'm leaving
this town is in a coffin.

55:27.124 --> 55:28.853
You think you've won.

55:28.854 --> 55:30.403
Look, I'm still here.

55:32.044 --> 55:34.203
And Tom will never
trust you, not really.

55:34.204 --> 55:35.563
Not like he used to.

55:43.854 --> 55:44.933
Give it back!

55:46.764 --> 55:47.843
Simon!

55:52.534 --> 55:53.743
OK.

55:55.674 --> 55:57.873
- Where are you going?
- To get my son.

55:59.284 --> 56:01.623
I saw the e-mail from the
hotel, I know where he is.

56:01.624 --> 56:03.083
We need to talk.
