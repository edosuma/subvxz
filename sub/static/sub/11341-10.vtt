00:23.991 --> 00:24.940
Hello?

00:24.942 --> 00:27.659
I'm gonna get you.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.628
I'm gonna get you.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.363
Stop it. I mean it.
This isn't funny anymore.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.716
Stop calling here.

00:39.555 --> 00:40.973
Who was it?

00:40.975 --> 00:42.507
That damn kid again.

00:42.509 --> 00:47.012
I can't believe the police
won't do anything about it.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.431
Where have you been?

00:49.433 --> 00:53.018
I couldn't sleep.
I went downstairs to watch TV

00:53.020 --> 00:55.153
and I conked out
on the couch.

00:56.105 --> 00:59.358
Isn't that guy at your office
a retired cop--

00:59.360 --> 01:00.409
Jake?

01:00.411 --> 01:01.526
Yeah.

01:01.528 --> 01:05.129
Can you talk to him?

01:05.132 --> 01:07.032
What's he gonna do?

01:07.034 --> 01:08.250
I don't know.

01:08.252 --> 01:10.502
I just want somebody
to do something.

01:10.504 --> 01:14.222
That kid'll get bored
soon enough.

01:22.632 --> 01:26.101
Ok, I'll talk to Jake.

01:33.776 --> 01:36.928
Andy, breakfast is ready!

01:36.930 --> 01:37.929
Hi.
Mmm.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.264
Mwah!

01:39.266 --> 01:40.449
Can you please
take Kozmo out?

01:40.451 --> 01:42.451
- Hey!
- Kozmo!

01:42.453 --> 01:44.152
Kozmo, come on.

01:44.154 --> 01:45.320
Andy!
Let's go, buddy.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.406
You're gonna be late!

01:47.408 --> 01:49.241
Andy!

01:49.243 --> 01:51.609
Andrew Taffert,

01:51.611 --> 01:55.113
you cannot
miss the bus again.

02:01.620 --> 02:05.424
You're supposed to be up.
I'm gonna pour cold water on you.

02:12.148 --> 02:13.598
Andy?

02:24.444 --> 02:27.579
Andy's not in his room.
Have you seen him?

02:29.332 --> 02:30.982
Oh, my God!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.484
What is that?

02:33.586 --> 02:34.836
Andy?!

02:34.838 --> 02:36.154
Andy!

02:36.156 --> 02:37.155
Where is he?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.156
I don't know.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.324
I'm calling the police.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.325
Andy!

02:40.327 --> 02:42.094
Andy?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.472
Did you see
what I did?

02:53.474 --> 02:55.941
Did you see it?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.442
We just got a call
from St. Louis.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.995
A missing child, a 10-year-old,
Andrew Taffert.

02:59.997 --> 03:01.446
Parents Lida
and Malcolm.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.065
Father found blood on the front
door this morning.

03:04.067 --> 03:06.118
I take it no test results
on the blood yet.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.702
No. That
would be correct.

03:07.704 --> 03:09.237
No signs of forced entry
or a struggle

03:09.239 --> 03:11.189
according to the initial
police report.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.524
Mom and dad put him
to bed at 10:00,

03:12.526 --> 03:13.858
woke up this morning,
he was gone.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.661
Any visitors or workers
to the house recently?

03:16.663 --> 03:18.914
No. But the parents say
in the last two weeks

03:18.916 --> 03:20.499
they've received
5 phone calls

03:20.501 --> 03:22.584
from what sounds like
a little boy prank calling them.

03:22.586 --> 03:24.421
They complained to authorities,
but police determined that

03:24.446 --> 03:25.588
no laws had been broken.

03:25.589 --> 03:27.088
Mm-hmm. The little boy
says, "I'm gonna get you."

03:27.090 --> 03:29.674
According the police reports,
there's a lot of crazy people

03:29.676 --> 03:31.162
talking in the background.

03:31.187 --> 03:33.012
It sounds like it's coming
from an asylum or a prison.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.563
I'd say the calls
might be coincidental

03:34.565 --> 03:36.359
except the boy called again
right after the parents

03:36.384 --> 03:38.018
found Andy missing,
and he had a different

03:38.019 --> 03:39.914
message this time.
"Did you see what I did?"

03:40.687 --> 03:42.020
So he's taunting them.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.688
Maybe this is about revenge.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.941
"I'm gonna get you"
is typically a threat,

03:45.943 --> 03:47.328
but in the case of children,

03:47.329 --> 03:49.829
it can also be a phrase
used during play.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.614
This sounds similar
to a cold case from 15 years ago,

03:52.616 --> 03:54.399
Frankie Clayvin
of Memphis.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.234
I remember that
Gideon handled it.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.286
It obviously
it predates all of you.

03:58.288 --> 03:59.955
Frankie Clayvin
was 9 years old at the time.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.423
He never made it home
from school one day.

04:01.425 --> 04:03.908
He was found dead
in the woods 36 hours later

04:03.910 --> 04:05.460
5 miles
from his house.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.911
And Frankie's parents
also received

04:06.913 --> 04:09.047
prank phone calls
from a young boy.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.234
I think Frankie's father
was the prime suspect at one point.

04:12.236 --> 04:14.352
Yeah, the police actually
tapped the Clayvins' phone,

04:14.354 --> 04:15.720
but they couldn't
trace the phone calls

04:15.722 --> 04:17.255
because they kept bouncing
between different pay phones

04:17.257 --> 04:18.473
in the greater
Memphis area.

04:18.475 --> 04:19.940
Phone calls before
an abduction-murder--

04:19.942 --> 04:21.259
it's a rare signature.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.727
But if it is
the same unsub,

04:22.729 --> 04:24.596
a dormancy period
of 15 years is highly unusual.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.198
Maybe we're looking
at a copycat.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.319
If I'm not mistaken,

04:27.344 --> 04:29.101
Frankie Clayvin was
killed within two hours

04:29.102 --> 04:30.268
of his abduction.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.103
Which means we're
wasting time. Let's go.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.292
911. What is your emergency?

04:37.294 --> 04:38.910
My son is gone!

04:38.912 --> 04:41.613
I checked his room
this morning and he's gone!

04:41.615 --> 04:44.115
I can't--

04:44.117 --> 04:45.984
We can't find him
anywhere.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.285
He's only 10.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.487
Ok, ma'am. We're sending
a unit right away.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.622
What's your son's name?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.807
We have a missing child

04:52.809 --> 04:54.292
at 472 Oakdale Drive,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.478
last seen yesterday
at 2100 hours.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.763
Andrew Taffert, born 2003,

04:58.765 --> 05:01.967
4 feet 7 inches,
short blond hair, blue eyes,

05:01.969 --> 05:05.070
wearing an orange sweatshirt
and plaid pajama pants.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.938
We're labeling as suspicious
circumstances

05:06.940 --> 05:09.274
and a possible abduction.

05:53.899 --> 05:56.266
Just confirmed there was
a 10-minute segment

05:56.268 --> 05:58.902
on the unsolved
Frankie Clayvin murder

05:58.904 --> 06:02.071
on a low-rated cable show
12 years ago.

06:02.073 --> 06:04.974
Even with low ratings, probably
a half million people saw it.

376,000.

It's not often I get to

06:08.330 --> 06:10.330
That makes it more likely
it could be a copycat.

06:10.332 --> 06:11.915
There's nothing unusual
about the Tafferts.

06:11.917 --> 06:14.534
The father Malcolm
is a stockbroker,

06:14.536 --> 06:15.668
mother works
at an antique shop.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.537
They describe Andy
as a bright, well-behaved kid

06:17.539 --> 06:18.755
who likes video games.

06:18.757 --> 06:21.374
Andy and Frankie are about
the same age and build

06:21.376 --> 06:23.042
with similar coloring.
If this is the same unsub,

06:23.044 --> 06:24.260
he definitely has a type.

06:24.262 --> 06:25.494
We need to consider
the possibility

06:25.496 --> 06:28.214
that Andy may have been
targeted by a pedophile.

06:28.216 --> 06:30.183
It could be someone
he met online playing video games.

06:30.185 --> 06:32.435
If there's any connection
to the cold case, though,

06:32.437 --> 06:34.637
there was no evidence
of sexual assault.

06:34.639 --> 06:37.640
Just in case,
I am pulling up a list

06:37.642 --> 06:39.392
of online players
as we speak.

06:39.394 --> 06:41.060
If this is the same unsub,
he must be using another child

06:41.062 --> 06:42.362
to make the prank phone calls.

06:42.364 --> 06:45.014
The original boy from 15 years
ago would be grown up by now.

06:45.016 --> 06:47.183
Or it's possible
the calls are recordings.

06:47.185 --> 06:49.319
Guys, I just got a message
from the local field office.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.322
The analysis from the blood from
the Taffert house just came in,

06:52.324 --> 06:54.374
and good news--
it is not Andy's.

06:54.376 --> 06:57.026
Actually it's pig's blood.

06:57.028 --> 07:00.079
Huh. Between that
and the phone calls,

07:00.081 --> 07:03.333
it's safe to say this unsub
likes to play games.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.701
Blake and I will go talk
to Frankie Clayvin's father.

07:05.703 --> 07:08.805
The rest of you
head to the Taffert house.

07:10.341 --> 07:12.976
The police made us
sit and wait

07:12.978 --> 07:14.494
until something went wrong.

07:14.496 --> 07:16.646
This makes no sense
at all.

07:16.648 --> 07:17.849
I know if feels that way,

07:17.874 --> 07:19.016
and we're very sorry,
but we're just--

07:19.017 --> 07:20.350
You're sorry?

07:20.352 --> 07:22.885
You're sorry.
Do you have kids?

07:22.887 --> 07:24.487
No.

07:24.489 --> 07:26.489
Then you have no idea
what this feels like.

07:26.491 --> 07:29.492
Sir, we don't presume to understand
how hard this is for you,

07:29.494 --> 07:31.995
but what we can do is
help you try to find Andy.

07:31.997 --> 07:34.998
Were there any changes
in the family routine recently,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.283
any new people that either
you or your son

07:37.285 --> 07:39.068
may have met socially
or at work?

07:39.070 --> 07:40.370
No.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.538
It's just the 3 of us,
so we are very close.

07:42.540 --> 07:46.009
When Lida and I aren't working,
we do everything together.

07:46.011 --> 07:48.211
We're good people.

07:48.213 --> 07:50.179
We go to church on Sunday.

07:50.181 --> 07:52.048
What about Andy?
Did you know all of his friends?

07:52.050 --> 07:54.684
Yes. We are very
careful about that.

07:54.686 --> 07:56.719
We--I don't want him
around kids

07:56.721 --> 07:58.354
who are a bad influence,

07:58.356 --> 08:01.391
so I run background checks
on the parents of his friends.

08:01.393 --> 08:04.927
And we taught Andy
to avoid strangers.

08:04.929 --> 08:06.612
He's very cautious.

08:08.482 --> 08:12.068
I apologize
that I yelled at you.

08:12.070 --> 08:14.487
That's not who I am.

08:14.489 --> 08:16.406
It's just that this whole
thing is surreal.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.792
This kind of thing
happens to other people,

08:19.794 --> 08:21.961
not to us.

08:26.333 --> 08:30.786
"I run background checks
on the parents of his friends"?

08:30.788 --> 08:32.337
Sounds pretty controlling.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.890
And they're selling
themselves as good parents,

08:34.893 --> 08:36.342
especially him.

08:36.344 --> 08:38.227
He could be trying
to hide something.

08:38.229 --> 08:40.279
Excuse me.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.081
Sorry to interrupt.

08:42.082 --> 08:43.900
Could I ask you a question?

08:43.902 --> 08:45.234
Of course.

08:45.236 --> 08:46.519
I heard on the news
last year

08:46.521 --> 08:49.355
that if a child disappears
and the police can find him

08:49.357 --> 08:53.076
within the first 24 hours,
the child will be ok.

08:53.078 --> 08:55.078
Is that right?

08:56.080 --> 08:58.414
It's no guarantee.

09:00.367 --> 09:03.035
But statistically, yes.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.959
So if Andy was forcibly taken,
why didn't he scream or call out?

09:09.961 --> 09:12.095
His parents' room
is right next door.

09:12.097 --> 09:14.097
The unsub could have
overpowered him,

09:14.099 --> 09:17.266
covered his mouth, or
had a gun at his head.

09:17.268 --> 09:20.303
Hmm. Look at this.

09:20.305 --> 09:21.637
It wasn't locked.

09:21.639 --> 09:24.307
So the unsub could have snuck in
while he was sleeping.

09:29.863 --> 09:31.531
That's interesting.

09:31.533 --> 09:32.982
What?

09:32.984 --> 09:34.283
I don't see any sneakers.

09:34.285 --> 09:37.353
I mean, almost every
10-year-old boy has a pair, right?

09:37.355 --> 09:40.022
I guess they're somewhere
else in the house?

09:40.024 --> 09:42.375
But mom seems like
a neat freak.

09:42.377 --> 09:43.993
What if Andy's wearing them?

09:43.995 --> 09:45.869
That means he would have

09:45.894 --> 09:47.531
had time to put
his shoes on and leave.

09:47.532 --> 09:50.166
Which means he was most likely
coaxed out by someone he knew.

09:51.536 --> 09:53.169
Hey, Garcia,
perfect timing.

09:53.171 --> 09:55.004
I have a list
of online players

09:55.006 --> 09:56.839
that Andy Taffert
played video games with.

09:56.841 --> 09:58.207
It's a short list
since his parents

09:58.209 --> 09:59.842
strictly controlled
his Internet access

09:59.844 --> 10:02.161
and only allowed him
to play with certain players.

10:02.163 --> 10:03.930
5 school friends,
to be exact.

10:03.932 --> 10:06.015
Any chance he met up
with one of them last night?

10:06.017 --> 10:07.716
Well, if he did, they didn't make
those plans online.

10:07.718 --> 10:09.902
All 5 of them
were at school today,

10:09.904 --> 10:12.772
and according to P.D. none of them
knew about Andy's disappearance.

10:12.774 --> 10:14.323
All right. Thanks.

10:14.325 --> 10:17.726
So if he wasn't lured out by one of
his friends, who was it?

10:17.728 --> 10:20.112
Are you sure this is
connected to my Frankie?

10:20.114 --> 10:22.665
No, sir, we're not. But the
circumstances are similar enough

10:22.667 --> 10:24.450
that we have to consider
the possibility.

10:24.452 --> 10:26.235
Could you tell us
where you were last night?

10:26.237 --> 10:28.204
Oh, I get it.

10:28.206 --> 10:31.507
I'm still a suspect
after 15 years.

10:34.245 --> 10:36.579
We just want to know
where you were.

10:36.581 --> 10:39.215
Mr. Clayvin.

10:39.217 --> 10:40.800
Did you see what I did?

10:40.802 --> 10:42.685
What was that?

10:42.687 --> 10:44.187
"Did you see what I did?"

10:44.189 --> 10:48.191
It's what that creep
said on the phone.

10:49.759 --> 10:53.279
You have no idea
what I've been through.

10:53.281 --> 10:55.565
We do know that
a year before Frankie was killed

10:55.567 --> 10:57.233
that his mother
committed suicide.

11:00.988 --> 11:03.372
So we know you've
been through a lot.

11:05.042 --> 11:07.960
Just when you think
it can't get any worse, it does.

11:09.279 --> 11:10.663
What do you mean?

11:10.665 --> 11:13.216
About a year after
Frankie died,

11:13.218 --> 11:16.636
my second wife
couldn't take it anymore.

11:16.638 --> 11:18.087
She left me,

11:18.089 --> 11:21.257
and I had a nervous breakdown.

11:22.543 --> 11:25.794
I was in a psychiatric
hospital for 3 weeks.

11:28.232 --> 11:31.133
Mr. Clayvin,
you have a phone call.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.277
Hello?

11:41.279 --> 11:43.946
I got you, didn't I?

11:43.948 --> 11:47.199
I told you I would get you.

11:50.621 --> 11:53.339
It was that little boy again.

11:53.341 --> 11:56.709
Somehow he--he found me
at the hospital.

11:56.711 --> 11:58.461
Why didn't you tell anyone
about this before?

11:58.463 --> 12:00.296
What does it matter?

12:00.298 --> 12:02.965
No one ever believed me.

12:02.967 --> 12:06.352
I would have.

12:06.354 --> 12:10.506
There is no doubt
in my mind that you're innocent.

12:13.510 --> 12:15.695
Last night I was at work.

12:15.697 --> 12:17.280
I'm a night security guard

12:17.282 --> 12:20.399
at a downtown office building.
I'm on the surveillance camera.

12:20.401 --> 12:21.400
Thank you.

12:21.402 --> 12:22.785
Excuse me.

12:24.788 --> 12:26.289
What have you got, Garcia?

12:26.291 --> 12:29.024
I triangulated the phone call
that came to the Tafferts' house

12:29.026 --> 12:30.186
at 303 a.m. last night,

12:30.211 --> 12:32.211
and all I can say is
Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot.

12:32.246 --> 12:37.166
That call originated from
Malcolm Taffert's cell phone.

12:37.168 --> 12:39.802
Ok. Thank you.

12:39.804 --> 12:41.304
Of course I didn't
make that call!

12:41.306 --> 12:44.056
I told you, I went
downstairs to watch TV

12:44.058 --> 12:45.424
and I fell asleep
on the couch,

12:45.426 --> 12:46.892
that the house phone
woke me up.

12:46.894 --> 12:48.711
Where was your cell phone?

12:48.713 --> 12:52.815
In the den. I leave it there
to charge overnight.

12:52.817 --> 12:54.934
Go ahead, check it.
You'll see.

12:54.936 --> 12:57.603
I didn't call my own home
in the middle of the night.

12:57.605 --> 12:59.405
You can't be serious.

12:59.407 --> 13:01.174
There is absolutely no way

13:01.199 --> 13:03.240
Malcolm could have done
something like this.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.311
I know my husband.

13:05.313 --> 13:08.531
What's his relationship
like with Andy?

13:10.900 --> 13:12.835
Malcolm dotes on him.

13:12.837 --> 13:16.739
It was like that from
the minute he was born.

13:16.741 --> 13:19.425
I swear, he changed
more diapers than I did.

13:19.427 --> 13:21.510
Ok. Um,

13:21.512 --> 13:24.013
you said there were a total
of 4 phone calls

13:24.015 --> 13:26.182
from the boy before
Andy disappeared.

13:26.184 --> 13:29.101
Were you and Malcolm
ever together for any of these calls?

13:32.272 --> 13:33.922
No.

13:35.091 --> 13:37.610
It was always one of us.

13:37.612 --> 13:40.062
Alone.

13:50.774 --> 13:52.625
There's nothing on his cell.

13:52.627 --> 13:57.163
House phone caller I.D.
at 3:03 a.m. says private number.

14:07.257 --> 14:10.509
He could have erased
the call from his phone.

14:19.135 --> 14:22.104
Dr. Reid. Got here
as fast as I could.

14:22.106 --> 14:23.406
I just came from
the Memphis office.

14:23.408 --> 14:24.824
They apologized
for the delay.

14:24.826 --> 14:27.576
They had trouble finding it in storage.
Thank you.

14:31.685 --> 14:35.796
I'm going to play you something
from the Clayvin case 15 years ago.

14:38.755 --> 14:41.424
I'm gonna get you.

14:41.426 --> 14:43.592
I'm gonna get you.

14:46.013 --> 14:48.931
That's like the call we got.

14:48.933 --> 14:51.183
You mean it's similar?

14:51.185 --> 14:52.685
No.

14:52.687 --> 14:56.055
It's the exact same call.

14:56.057 --> 14:58.774
Blake was right.
It's a recording.

14:58.776 --> 15:00.176
This isn't a copycat.

15:00.178 --> 15:03.178
We're dealing with
the same unsub.

15:03.180 --> 15:06.181
Malcolm Taffert would have
been in his early 20s

15:06.183 --> 15:07.650
when Frankie disappeared.

15:07.652 --> 15:09.652
So it's possible
he's the unsub,

15:09.654 --> 15:12.020
but he didn't seem to have
a connection with the Clayvin family.

15:12.022 --> 15:14.690
He never even worked
in the same city.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.409
Go ahead, Garcia.

15:17.411 --> 15:19.712
Whoever's behind this
is very tech savvy with phones.

15:19.714 --> 15:21.864
As it turns out, the unsub

15:21.866 --> 15:23.866
cloned Malcolm Taffert's
cell number,

15:23.868 --> 15:26.469
and the call came from
outside of the house,

15:26.471 --> 15:30.489
a quarter of a mile east,
to be exact.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.543
There's no way Malcolm
could have made that phone call

15:34.545 --> 15:36.545
and been back in his bedroom
by the time his wife hung up.

15:36.547 --> 15:39.214
What's a quarter mile
east of the Taffert house?

15:39.216 --> 15:43.219
Uh, I'm seeing woods
and a reservoir.

15:43.221 --> 15:45.855
Let's take Malcolm with us.
He'll know where Andy liked to play.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.723
Andy Taffert!

15:47.725 --> 15:50.893
We're the police!
We're here to help you!

15:50.895 --> 15:53.228
There's an abandoned
well out this way.

15:53.230 --> 15:55.731
Andy and his friends
found it last summer.

15:55.733 --> 15:57.566
And I told him I didn't
like him to come out here,

15:57.568 --> 16:00.252
but...
Well, he ignored me.

16:03.006 --> 16:04.173
I don't understand.

16:04.175 --> 16:06.325
You said
there was a recording.

16:06.327 --> 16:07.843
I'm supposed to just
talk to it?

16:07.845 --> 16:10.095
We have to assume whoever
took Andy is listening.

16:10.097 --> 16:13.132
Now, when he calls,
try to stay as neutral as possible.

16:13.134 --> 16:15.367
Don't let him feed
off your anxiety.

16:15.369 --> 16:18.086
And remember, you're trying
to start a dialogue,

16:18.088 --> 16:20.055
so avoid questions that
have yes or no answers.

16:20.057 --> 16:21.891
I don't think
I can do this.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.058
You have to.

16:24.728 --> 16:28.280
Now, the first question you're
gonna ask is, how's Andy doing?

16:28.282 --> 16:30.733
Ok?

16:32.702 --> 16:35.103
Uh, it's right up here.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.610
Get those up here!

16:41.612 --> 16:42.745
Hey, guys, what--what--

16:42.747 --> 16:44.747
he may have found something.

16:44.749 --> 16:47.049
Mr. Taffert!
Mr. Taffert!

16:47.051 --> 16:49.668
We don't know if it's--
Andy! Andy, is that you?!

16:49.670 --> 16:51.637
Andy, it's daddy!
Andy, it's daddy!

16:51.639 --> 16:53.973
We don't know if it's him yet,
Mr. Taffert.

17:02.098 --> 17:03.515
He's not talking.

17:03.517 --> 17:04.633
Please let us
handle this.

17:04.635 --> 17:06.902
Why--why isn't he talking?

17:06.904 --> 17:08.237
Just let us
do our job.

17:08.239 --> 17:09.855
Can you take him back
to the house, please?

17:09.857 --> 17:12.074
Why...

17:12.076 --> 17:14.326
Please, just go.
Just go.

17:14.328 --> 17:15.861
Andy!

17:15.863 --> 17:17.613
Mr. Taffert!

17:25.655 --> 17:26.872
Hello?

17:26.874 --> 17:29.341
I got you, didn't I?

17:29.343 --> 17:31.510
I told you
I would get you.

17:31.512 --> 17:32.878
How's Andy doing?

17:34.382 --> 17:36.632
Hello?

17:36.634 --> 17:38.333
Hello!

18:09.950 --> 18:12.702
Andy was strangled
with a nylon cord.

18:12.704 --> 18:14.621
Do you have an approximate
time of death?

18:14.623 --> 18:16.973
Based on rigor mortis,
I'd say 12 hours ago.

18:16.975 --> 18:18.941
He was dead before
he was reported missing.

18:18.943 --> 18:22.128
He was killed within
a couple hours of his abduction,

18:22.130 --> 18:24.530
the same M.O. as in
Frankie Clayvin's case.

18:24.532 --> 18:25.798
Any sign of sexual assault?

18:25.800 --> 18:26.966
Not on preliminary exam.

18:26.968 --> 18:28.434
I mean, you saw
he was fully dressed.

18:28.436 --> 18:32.338
There's no sign the clothing was
removed and then put back on.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.806
Excuse me.

18:33.808 --> 18:37.977
You know, the way Andy's body
was found on that bed of leaves,

18:37.979 --> 18:39.812
it almost looked like
he was sleeping.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.448
The unsub wanted him
to appear peaceful.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.150
Remorse?

18:44.152 --> 18:46.285
Well, that's
in Stark contrast

18:46.287 --> 18:49.288
to the violent imagery of blood
on the Tafferts' front door.

18:49.290 --> 18:52.024
"I shall see the blood
and pass you by."

18:52.026 --> 18:54.126
Exodus.

18:54.128 --> 18:56.329
The tenth plague of Egypt,
the death of the firstborn.

18:56.331 --> 18:58.164
God commanded Moses
to tell the Israelites

18:58.166 --> 18:59.498
to put lamb's blood
above their door

18:59.500 --> 19:00.716
to spare
their firstborn.

19:00.718 --> 19:03.669
The blood on the Tafferts'
door could be related,

19:03.671 --> 19:05.921
but the unsub's
got it backwards.

19:05.923 --> 19:09.342
Unless he thinks he spared Andy
a fate worse than death.

19:10.877 --> 19:13.579
The other agent said
he'd be ok.

19:13.581 --> 19:17.600
If they found him
within 24 hours, he'd be ok.

19:17.602 --> 19:19.718
That's always the hope.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.554
But we never know for sure.

19:22.556 --> 19:24.523
Oh, God.

19:25.826 --> 19:30.446
He was dead before
I even knew he was missing.

19:31.498 --> 19:33.199
I didn't...

19:35.118 --> 19:38.621
I should have
checked sooner.

19:40.374 --> 19:42.241
This isn't your fault.

19:47.130 --> 19:50.416
You guys can hang out
in here for now.

19:53.136 --> 19:54.603
Can I get you anything?

19:56.023 --> 19:58.924
No, thank you.

20:01.728 --> 20:04.230
Excuse me.

20:11.204 --> 20:13.239
Are they the parents?

20:13.241 --> 20:15.324
Yes.

20:15.326 --> 20:18.210
I'd like
to talk with them.

20:19.579 --> 20:21.780
I'll go check.

20:25.803 --> 20:28.721
There's someone here
who wants to speak with you.

20:28.723 --> 20:32.058
Would that be ok?

20:32.060 --> 20:34.093
Sure.

20:42.135 --> 20:44.437
Go ahead.

20:52.612 --> 20:54.864
My name is Richard Clayvin.

20:54.866 --> 20:58.617
The same maniac
who killed your boy...

20:58.619 --> 21:01.287
killed my son, too.

21:02.989 --> 21:05.291
I'm the only person
in the world

21:05.293 --> 21:08.294
who truly knows what you're
going through right now.

21:33.703 --> 21:36.322
Look at how bereft they are.

21:36.324 --> 21:38.190
That's hard to fake.

21:38.192 --> 21:41.660
There's no way
any of them are involved.

21:46.699 --> 21:48.551
Do you have any suspects
or leads?

21:48.553 --> 21:49.701
What can you tell us?

21:49.703 --> 21:51.337
We're considering
all suspects,

21:51.339 --> 21:54.557
but we're focusing outside
the household at this time,

21:54.559 --> 21:57.709
so please respect the Tafferts' privacy
and allow them to grieve.

21:57.711 --> 21:59.711
We believe the same person
who killed Andy Taffert

21:59.713 --> 22:02.731
killed Frankie Clayvin
of Memphis 15 years ago.

22:02.733 --> 22:06.352
The taunting phone calls
mean he's sadistic to the parents.

22:06.354 --> 22:07.987
And the use
of the young boy's voice

22:07.989 --> 22:10.322
means that he identifies
in some way with the child.

22:10.324 --> 22:12.210
Now, he could be seeking
revenge for some injustice

22:12.235 --> 22:13.410
he suffered in his youth.

22:13.411 --> 22:15.194
But then
why kill the children?

22:15.196 --> 22:16.829
In his mind
they may be mercy kills.

22:16.831 --> 22:19.782
The fact that he's not torturing
or sexually abusing them

22:19.784 --> 22:22.701
and he's posing them as if
they're sleeping suggests remorse.

22:22.703 --> 22:24.336
Based on
his victim choice,

22:24.338 --> 22:26.705
he's likely a Caucasian male
in his late 30s

22:26.707 --> 22:28.123
and possibly older.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.125
We know he's technically
skilled, so look for someone

22:30.127 --> 22:32.178
with a computer
or engineering background.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.046
And based on the blood
left on the Tafferts' door,

22:34.048 --> 22:36.515
we may be looking for
someone extremely religious.

22:36.517 --> 22:38.884
He was able to lure
Andy away in the middle of the night,

22:38.886 --> 22:40.553
which suggests
he's socially skilled

22:40.555 --> 22:42.471
or he may know
the victim's family.

22:42.473 --> 22:44.557
Although we only know
of one other abduction-murder

22:44.559 --> 22:47.893
15 years ago, he may
have been overseas, incarcerated,

22:47.895 --> 22:49.928
or incapacitated
during that time.

22:49.930 --> 22:52.565
So families with young sons
should remain vigilant,

22:52.567 --> 22:55.367
and we ask that if anybody saw
Andy Taffert late at night--or anytime--

22:55.369 --> 22:57.369
with someone fitting
the suspect's description

22:57.371 --> 23:00.072
we ask that you call
St. Louis FBI immediately.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.740
Thank you.

23:01.742 --> 23:04.493
I'm gonna get you.

23:04.495 --> 23:07.213
I'm gonna get you.

23:07.215 --> 23:10.749
All right, now,
this is without the boy's voice.

23:10.751 --> 23:13.285
Listen to the background.

23:18.226 --> 23:20.414
The voices are dozens

23:20.439 --> 23:22.439
of separate audio bytes
all spliced together.

23:22.813 --> 23:24.563
Look.

23:24.565 --> 23:28.901
All the different tracks
layered on top of each other.

23:28.903 --> 23:30.769
Exactly. And the boy's voice

23:30.771 --> 23:32.238
was the dominant layer.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.273
Were you able to get anything
off the background sounds?

23:34.275 --> 23:36.325
There is something.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.994
Pare!

23:38.996 --> 23:40.746
Isso vai sair mais caro
a voce.

23:40.748 --> 23:43.249
Now, my Brazilian
Portuguese is rusty,

23:43.251 --> 23:46.285
but I think she saying
"stop," which is "pare,"

23:46.287 --> 23:47.819
and then something
about more money,

23:47.821 --> 23:49.505
something costing
more money.

23:49.507 --> 23:50.822
Can you replay it?

23:50.824 --> 23:51.823
Yeah.

23:52.826 --> 23:54.176
Pare!

23:54.178 --> 23:55.994
Isso vai sair mais caro
a voce.

23:55.996 --> 23:58.681
I hear something
right before she says "pare."

23:58.683 --> 24:00.549
It sort of sounded
like a whip.

24:00.551 --> 24:01.500
And her tone changes.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.019
When she says "stop"
she sounds afraid,

24:03.020 --> 24:04.836
but then the rest
is matter of fact.

24:04.838 --> 24:07.473
So is she just pretending
to be scared?

24:07.475 --> 24:08.641
She's asking
for more money,

24:08.643 --> 24:12.528
so she could be
being paid to be tortured.

24:12.530 --> 24:13.812
What if she's a prostitute?

24:13.814 --> 24:16.532
This could be an S & M
scenario she was hired for.

24:19.536 --> 24:21.537
This is where
a pimp works?

24:21.539 --> 24:23.522
According
to our local source,

24:23.524 --> 24:25.524
of all the pimps in town,

24:25.526 --> 24:28.410
this is the guy known
for imported girls.

24:29.996 --> 24:32.164
Pare!

24:32.166 --> 24:33.865
Isso vai sair mais caro
a voce.

24:33.867 --> 24:35.467
Do you know who she is?

24:35.469 --> 24:36.688
She's speaking
Brazilian Portuguese

24:36.713 --> 24:38.388
if that helps
jog your memory.

24:38.389 --> 24:42.040
What am I,
rosetta stone?

24:42.042 --> 24:43.810
Well, we have reason
to believe she's a prostitute.

24:43.811 --> 24:46.347
Any of your girls,
maybe from 15 years back,

24:46.372 --> 24:47.714
speak Portuguese?

24:47.715 --> 24:49.148
I don't know
who sent you guys,

24:49.150 --> 24:51.684
but you obviously
got the wrong idea about me.

24:51.686 --> 24:54.219
As you can plainly see,
I'm a...

24:54.221 --> 24:55.854
purveyor of fine meats.

24:55.856 --> 24:57.356
No, Leon, we were told
that you run

24:57.358 --> 24:59.358
a pretty lucrative
business on the side.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.110
Now you're
flattering me.

25:01.112 --> 25:02.691
I make a mean barbecue sauce,

25:02.716 --> 25:04.727
but I don't make
much money on it.

25:04.732 --> 25:06.732
You know,
I find it interesting

25:06.734 --> 25:08.951
you haven't asked
what any of this is about.

25:08.953 --> 25:11.503
I have a dreadful
lack of curiosity.

25:11.505 --> 25:12.972
Well, let me fill you in.

25:12.974 --> 25:14.873
A child was murdered
yesterday

25:14.875 --> 25:17.710
and at his home they found
blood on his front door.

25:17.712 --> 25:18.794
Pig's blood.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.963
You know what? It actually
just occurred to me,

25:20.965 --> 25:22.514
but I feel like
this is the sort of shop

25:22.516 --> 25:24.016
you could find
a lot of pig's blood.

25:24.018 --> 25:24.967
Oh, you're right.

25:24.969 --> 25:26.268
We're not saying
you had anything

25:26.270 --> 25:27.970
to do with this, Leon.
But we are saying that the FBI

25:27.972 --> 25:29.605
is desperate for any leads,
and it would be a shame

25:29.607 --> 25:32.024
if we had to shut your shop down
to collect DNA samples

25:32.026 --> 25:35.361
to try to identify the source
of that pig's blood.

25:35.363 --> 25:36.979
Now, look.

25:36.981 --> 25:40.599
I don't know nothin'
about blood on a door.

25:40.601 --> 25:43.736
But I think I do remember
something about, uh,

25:43.738 --> 25:46.705
a couple of Brazilian girls
who used to work for a...

25:46.707 --> 25:48.624
an acquaintance of mine.

25:48.626 --> 25:49.992
What were their names?

25:49.994 --> 25:53.111
Raquel Castro
and Luisa Gomez.

25:53.113 --> 25:55.631
Raquel moved back
to Brazil in '95.

25:55.633 --> 25:57.049
What about Luisa?

25:57.051 --> 26:01.119
That bitch? She totally
betrayed my buddy.

26:01.121 --> 26:02.421
Did she walk out on him?

26:02.423 --> 26:06.475
No. She married
his best customer.

26:09.980 --> 26:11.296
Hi. Can I help you?

26:11.298 --> 26:14.733
We're Special Agents Rossi
and Morgan from the FBI.

26:14.735 --> 26:16.769
We're looking
for a Marla Golden.

26:16.771 --> 26:18.637
Who is it, Holly?

26:19.989 --> 26:22.825
Hello, ma'am.
Are you Marla Golden?

26:26.496 --> 26:28.280
That's very tragic,

26:28.282 --> 26:30.249
but I don't know
anything about these boys.

26:30.251 --> 26:32.618
Mrs. Golden, we know
that you're Luisa Gomez.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.370
Now, you can save us a whole lot
of trouble if you'll just come clean.

26:35.372 --> 26:38.207
I'm afraid I don't
know what you're talking about.

26:38.209 --> 26:39.156
Ma'am, these two boys are dead,

26:39.181 --> 26:41.508
and their parents
are extremely devastated.

26:41.829 --> 26:44.496
We have to find out
who killed them.

26:44.498 --> 26:47.166
You're a mother, too.

26:47.168 --> 26:50.536
You have a child
you left behind in Brazil

26:50.538 --> 26:52.037
that you're sending money to.

26:52.039 --> 26:53.472
Can you imagine
how you would feel

26:53.474 --> 26:57.526
is something terrible
happened to Renaldo?

26:57.528 --> 26:59.228
Or Holly?

27:00.346 --> 27:02.648
When I first came
to this country,

27:02.650 --> 27:05.317
I did things
I'm not proud of.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.785
But I had to survive.

27:06.787 --> 27:08.704
Did you ever do anything
involving a child?

27:08.706 --> 27:10.589
No, I would never.

27:10.591 --> 27:11.824
What about any S & M?

27:11.826 --> 27:14.159
Were you ever paid
to be tortured?

27:14.161 --> 27:16.829
Once a long time ago,

27:16.831 --> 27:18.664
there was a couple.

27:18.666 --> 27:20.132
It was an American man,

27:20.134 --> 27:25.036
and his wife was from
Eastern Europe or somewhere.

27:25.038 --> 27:28.173
She was very petite.

27:28.175 --> 27:32.344
The man wanted to torture us
with whips and videotape it.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.980
How bad was the torture?

27:34.982 --> 27:38.767
For me it was pretend.
I didn't let it get too far.

27:38.769 --> 27:41.653
But his wife
seemed really scared.

27:41.655 --> 27:45.107
For her I think
it was brutal.

27:45.992 --> 27:48.227
The Taffert house
is quiet right now.

27:48.229 --> 27:50.362
Neighbors reported seeing
Malcolm and Lida Taffert

27:50.364 --> 27:52.698
leave earlier today
and they haven't returned.

27:52.700 --> 27:53.883
There's still speculation

27:53.908 --> 27:55.908
the Tafferts can't be
completely innocent

27:56.036 --> 27:57.836
based on an exchange
Malcolm Taffert had

27:57.838 --> 27:59.588
with another
reporter this afternoon.

28:03.543 --> 28:06.612
Are they still there?

28:08.364 --> 28:11.350
Why won't they
just leave us alone?

28:11.352 --> 28:14.102
Because they are parasites.

28:21.561 --> 28:24.780
Andy didn't like this on him.

28:27.266 --> 28:29.451
What?

28:29.453 --> 28:32.120
He didn't like this yellow
jacket on his monkey.

28:35.658 --> 28:38.410
You shouldn't have said
anything to that reporter.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.245
I wasn't going to stand by
while they accused me

28:40.247 --> 28:41.797
he was baiting you!
Of doing horrible things

28:41.799 --> 28:43.382
to my own child!

28:44.717 --> 28:47.469
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

28:47.471 --> 28:49.805
To the drugstore.
We need toothpaste.

28:49.807 --> 28:51.673
You want me
to go with you?

28:51.675 --> 28:52.808
No!

28:52.810 --> 28:56.461
I--I just need
some fresh air. Ok?

28:58.565 --> 29:00.766
Ok.

29:23.122 --> 29:24.322
Lida--

29:24.324 --> 29:26.825
I'm gonna get you.

29:26.827 --> 29:29.761
I'm gonna get you.

29:29.763 --> 29:31.997
Lida!

29:38.938 --> 29:40.606
Lida!

29:44.510 --> 29:46.478
Lida!

29:54.430 --> 29:57.414
The door was open,
the engine still running,

29:57.416 --> 29:59.416
and the car in park.
No signs of a struggle.

29:59.418 --> 30:01.502
So she stopped
for someone voluntarily.

30:01.504 --> 30:03.104
Most likely somebody she knew,
but she also would have stopped

30:03.106 --> 30:04.856
for a police officer
or somebody that was injured.

30:04.858 --> 30:06.224
Or someone
masquerading as such.

30:06.226 --> 30:07.859
The search needs
to be expanded to include anyone

30:07.861 --> 30:10.695
anyone the Tafferts had contact
with before the phone calls began.

30:10.697 --> 30:13.597
Malcolm Taffert said they didn't
tell anyone they were here.

30:13.599 --> 30:15.199
Then somebody must have
followed them here,

30:15.201 --> 30:17.952
or the unsub found their location
through some other means.

30:17.954 --> 30:20.154
How's he doing?

30:23.075 --> 30:26.294
Just as you'd expect.

30:26.296 --> 30:29.247
To switch from male
child victims

30:29.249 --> 30:32.216
to a female adult
is highly unusual.

30:32.218 --> 30:36.671
The last call went
to Malcolm's cell phone.

30:36.673 --> 30:39.590
Maybe this is personal,
just like torturing Richard Clayvin

30:39.592 --> 30:41.726
in the psychiatric unit was.

30:41.728 --> 30:44.595
The fathers could be
the real target of the unsub's rage.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.432
Outside of being
Caucasian males,

30:48.434 --> 30:51.269
the two fathers
are pretty different.

30:51.271 --> 30:53.304
Malcolm Taffert's
upper middle class.

30:53.306 --> 30:55.106
Richard Clayvin's
a blue collar guy.

30:55.108 --> 30:56.757
Their hobbies
are different as well.

30:56.759 --> 30:58.475
Malcolm is a wine collector.

30:58.477 --> 31:00.244
Richard likes fishing.

31:00.246 --> 31:01.946
What about their wives?

31:01.948 --> 31:03.581
Why was Lida Taffert
kidnapped,

31:03.583 --> 31:06.117
but nothing happened
to Frankie Clayvin's mother?

31:06.119 --> 31:07.368
She's a stepmom?

31:07.370 --> 31:09.871
Richard remarried
before Frankie was abducted.

31:09.873 --> 31:12.123
His biological mom
was already dead.

31:14.793 --> 31:16.460
Yeah, baby girl,
I need you, boo.

31:16.462 --> 31:18.262
Always ready and eager
to serve you.

31:18.264 --> 31:20.047
I need the 4-1-1 on
Frankie Clayvin's mother.

31:20.049 --> 31:22.666
I'll have it in a mere
1, 2, 3, 4,

31:22.668 --> 31:24.335
5 keystrokes away. Ok.

31:24.337 --> 31:26.187
Frankie's birth mother’s
name was Nadia,

31:26.189 --> 31:27.271
she's from Romania,

31:27.273 --> 31:28.773
she had a history
of depression

31:28.775 --> 31:30.942
and ended up
taking her own life.

31:30.944 --> 31:32.059
Romania.

31:32.061 --> 31:34.195
Didn't the former
prostitute say

31:34.197 --> 31:36.898
she had a sexual encounter
with an American man

31:36.900 --> 31:39.350
and an eastern
European woman?

31:39.352 --> 31:42.036
Well, could it have been
Frankie's parents?

31:42.038 --> 31:43.011
She said she was petite.

31:43.036 --> 31:45.386
Garcia, any idea how tall
Frankie's mother was?

31:45.491 --> 31:48.543
I'm checking
autopsy records now.

31:48.545 --> 31:49.977
Nadia was 5'8".

31:49.979 --> 31:52.129
No, it wasn't her.

31:52.131 --> 31:54.932
But there's gotta be
a connection here somewhere.

31:54.934 --> 31:57.635
Nadia's Romanian.
Lida Taffert is Polish.

31:57.637 --> 31:59.587
Then there's a third woman
from 15 years ago

31:59.589 --> 32:01.923
who's eastern European.
Maybe she's the unsub's mother.

32:01.925 --> 32:03.391
Well, that first call
to the Clayvins

32:03.393 --> 32:06.561
came around the one-year
anniversary of Nadia's death.

32:07.729 --> 32:11.432
Maybe the unsub's mother
committed suicide as well.

32:14.686 --> 32:17.521
Bottom line,
we need to figure out

32:17.523 --> 32:20.358
who the mystery woman is.

32:48.086 --> 32:50.554
There's a GPS tracking app
on Malcolm's cell phone.

32:50.556 --> 32:53.608
The unsub could have easily located
the Tafferts at the motel through that.

32:54.760 --> 32:55.759
Go ahead, Garcia.

32:55.761 --> 32:57.311
I have got a list
of Easter European women

32:57.313 --> 32:58.590
around the Memphis area

32:58.615 --> 33:00.816
who committed suicide
within the last 4 decades.

33:00.817 --> 33:03.117
It's a short list. The most
relevant name is Olga Milworth,

33:03.119 --> 33:05.102
who was from Romania.

33:05.104 --> 33:06.203
Like Nadia Clayvin was.

33:06.205 --> 33:07.722
Yeah. She was married
to an American

33:07.724 --> 33:10.157
named Charles Milworth,
and 19 yea ago

33:10.159 --> 33:12.076
she tried to kill herself
and her son.

33:12.078 --> 33:14.211
Get this--her son survived.

33:15.113 --> 33:16.247
What's his name?

33:16.249 --> 33:17.614
His name's Daniel Milworth,

33:17.616 --> 33:20.718
and he was incarcerated
in Arizona for 11 years

33:20.720 --> 33:23.387
in a psychiatric hospital
for the criminally insane

33:23.389 --> 33:26.223
because he kidnapped
and tortured a prostitute.

33:26.225 --> 33:27.745
That would explain
his dormancy period.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.061
Garcia, where is he now?

33:29.062 --> 33:30.594
Uh, well,
once he was released,

33:30.596 --> 33:32.430
it appears he vanished.

33:32.432 --> 33:33.848
There's no record
of him anywhere.

33:33.850 --> 33:36.150
I'm gonna take a guess
he changed his identity.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.117
You know this man?

33:53.119 --> 33:54.785
If you took away
the beard and the glasses,

33:54.787 --> 33:58.673
he looks like Andy's
computer science teacher at school.

33:58.675 --> 34:01.959
Um...Burt Solomon.

34:01.961 --> 34:04.161
Was Andy close to him?

34:04.163 --> 34:05.463
He was one of his favorites.

34:05.465 --> 34:09.166
I guess he lets the kids
play video games in class.

34:09.168 --> 34:12.687
That could be how
Andy was lured out.

34:19.010 --> 34:21.862
And why Lida stopped
for someone.

34:28.203 --> 34:30.353
Are you saying
Burt Solomon did this?

34:30.356 --> 34:31.661
We can't say for sure,

34:31.686 --> 34:32.741
but we definitely
need to talk to him.

34:32.742 --> 34:35.242
As soon as we know anything,
you'll be the first to know.

34:35.244 --> 34:37.962
Garcia, I need an address
for Burt Solomon.

34:37.964 --> 34:39.580
He's a teacher
at Andy Taffert's school

34:54.096 --> 34:55.096
Hello.

34:55.098 --> 34:57.063
Did you see what I did?

34:57.065 --> 34:58.899
Did you see it?

35:00.068 --> 35:02.219
What the hell
did you do to her?

35:02.221 --> 35:03.604
Did you kill Lida?!

35:03.606 --> 35:05.773
Did you?!

35:21.583 --> 35:24.834
Burt Solomon's been teaching
at Andy's school for two years.

35:24.836 --> 35:27.504
It fits the timeline.
He's gotta be our unsub.

35:27.506 --> 35:29.672
Burt Solomon,
aka Daniel Milworth,

35:29.674 --> 35:31.591
probably
bought a fake I.D.

35:31.593 --> 35:34.094
and even fake
teaching credentials.

35:34.096 --> 35:35.712
What have you got,
Garcia?

35:35.714 --> 35:37.464
I've got more information
on Daniel Milworth.

35:37.466 --> 35:39.099
According to prison
psychiatric records,

35:39.101 --> 35:41.351
his mom was a Romanian
mail order bride.

35:41.353 --> 35:43.636
His dad made her perform

35:43.638 --> 35:45.555
demeaning sex acts
with prostitutes

35:45.557 --> 35:48.341
and then he forced young
Daniel to watch.

35:48.343 --> 35:50.176
No!

35:50.178 --> 35:52.178
Stop! Stop!

35:53.482 --> 35:55.281
Aah!

35:55.283 --> 35:57.634
If the mother spoke
poor English and was unskilled,

35:57.636 --> 36:00.019
she probably felt trapped
in her situation.

36:00.021 --> 36:01.988
In her mind, killing
herself and her son

36:01.990 --> 36:03.490
was their only means
of escape.

36:03.492 --> 36:05.158
Garcia,
how did the mother die?

36:05.160 --> 36:08.294
Uh, she drive a car
into a lake.

36:20.474 --> 36:24.511
Daniel managed to break out
a window and escape.

36:24.513 --> 36:26.596
Any idea
how Daniel Milworth

36:26.598 --> 36:28.314
crossed paths
with the Clayvins?

36:28.316 --> 36:30.886
Yeah. He volunteered as a
teacher's aide while he was in college,

36:30.887 --> 36:32.538
and one of the schools
he happened to work at

36:32.539 --> 36:34.038
was Frankie's.

36:34.489 --> 36:36.940
Seeing the American father/
immigrant mother dynamic

36:36.942 --> 36:38.975
must have amplified his negative
feelings about his own family,

36:38.977 --> 36:41.177
especially after Nadia Clayvin
committed suicide.

36:41.179 --> 36:43.396
And after a stint in prison,
he saw the same dynamic again

36:43.398 --> 36:45.031
in Andy Taffert's parents.

36:45.033 --> 36:47.733
But Lida Taffert didn't
try to commit suicide.

36:47.735 --> 36:49.786
No, she didn't have to.

36:49.788 --> 36:52.122
He'd killed once already
and he saw the similarity

36:52.124 --> 36:54.124
between his own parents
and the Tafferts

36:54.126 --> 36:56.242
and he turned them
into surrogates.

37:03.517 --> 37:06.052
So he killed the boys
to rescue them from their fathers,

37:06.054 --> 37:09.305
just as he wished
he had been saved.

37:09.307 --> 37:13.059
Then he may be trying
to rescue Lida Taffert, too.

37:13.927 --> 37:16.312
Guys, a red alert.
We've got a trace

37:16.314 --> 37:18.000
on the last call made
to Malcolm Taffert's cell

37:18.025 --> 37:19.400
and it seems to be sticking.

37:19.401 --> 37:21.151
It's from a remote area

37:21.153 --> 37:23.069
5.2 miles
off of Cold Ridge Road.

37:23.071 --> 37:25.522
All right, we'll head there.
But he's good at rerouting calls,

37:25.524 --> 37:27.940
so let's split up. Dave, you go to
Burt Solomon's house.

37:27.942 --> 37:29.459
Got it.

37:37.117 --> 37:39.452
FBI!

37:46.960 --> 37:48.928
Clear!
Clear!

37:48.930 --> 37:51.147
All clear!

37:54.652 --> 37:56.135
He's not here.

37:56.137 --> 37:59.906
Someone's been
very busy here.

37:59.908 --> 38:03.643
It's an Angelfish
for cloning phone numbers.

38:04.495 --> 38:07.413
I'm gonna get you.

38:07.415 --> 38:11.201
I'm gonna get you.

38:13.954 --> 38:16.322
Did you see what I did?

38:16.324 --> 38:17.540
Did you see it?

38:17.542 --> 38:21.094
I got you, didn't I?

38:21.096 --> 38:24.464
I told you
I would get you.

38:24.466 --> 38:28.768
Good boy, Danny!

38:28.770 --> 38:31.471
He used this video
to make the recordings.

38:31.473 --> 38:33.723
I'll let the others know
Daniel Milworth's not here.

38:33.725 --> 38:36.476
All right, thanks, Rossi.
We'll keep a lookout for him.

38:36.478 --> 38:37.727
This is it.

39:14.933 --> 39:16.099
Aah!

39:33.417 --> 39:35.568
Guys, I think he's near me.

39:42.543 --> 39:45.545
Quite the altar.

39:45.547 --> 39:48.748
He definitely has a thing
about mothers.

39:56.807 --> 39:58.975
I may have something.

40:05.783 --> 40:09.118
It's a decoy.

40:10.655 --> 40:12.071
Do you hear that?

40:17.746 --> 40:19.462
It's coming from behind here.

40:31.925 --> 40:33.476
Hey, guys, this is awful.

40:33.478 --> 40:35.978
Daniel's father didn't
just make him watch

40:35.980 --> 40:38.097
the sexual encounters,
he made him videotape them.

40:38.099 --> 40:41.651
Daniel, are you getting this?

40:54.031 --> 40:55.915
It's a secret hallway
connected to his bedroom.

40:55.917 --> 40:57.784
Lida Taffert was inside.

41:14.435 --> 41:17.637
"We cannot
despair of humanity,

41:17.639 --> 41:21.674
since we ourselves
are human beings."

41:21.676 --> 41:23.643
Albert Einstein.

41:24.812 --> 41:26.846
If you don't want
to be in the house,

41:26.848 --> 41:29.282
we could certainly take you
to a friend or a relative's.

41:29.284 --> 41:33.736
Uh, no.
Lida wants to stay.

41:33.738 --> 41:35.405
So do I.

41:35.407 --> 41:37.990
We feel closer
to Andy here.

41:37.992 --> 41:39.992
We understand.

41:41.562 --> 41:43.496
And if there's anything
at all that you need,

41:43.498 --> 41:45.197
please don't hesitate
to call.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.753
This will be
a difficult time for you.

41:50.755 --> 41:53.423
But you're not alone.

41:55.709 --> 41:58.044
Thank you.
