WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:05.018
<i>They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.</i>

00:05.043 --> 00:07.377
<i>Fallen angels, if you ask me.</i>

00:07.479 --> 00:09.613
<i>Look in any window late at night,</i>

00:09.681 --> 00:12.115
<i>and you'll see the lonely swiping right,</i>

00:12.184 --> 00:15.585
<i>the innocent reveling in their dreams,</i>

00:15.654 --> 00:18.394
<i>and the wicked in the cheating embrace</i>

00:18.419 --> 00:19.689
<i>of an illicit affair.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:22.217
<i>You could almost smell his cologne</i>

00:22.242 --> 00:24.276
<i>wafting over the crashing surf.</i>

00:24.650 --> 00:28.752
<i>The scent had a name... Betrayal.</i>

00:28.854 --> 00:30.353
You done?

00:30.455 --> 00:31.521
C'mon!

00:31.590 --> 00:33.390
It's classic voice-over,
like in every P.I. movie.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.457
Yeah, I know what it is.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.493
And it, too, has a name... annoying.

00:36.561 --> 00:39.687
You know, if you're bored,
you don't have to be here.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.573
The deal was you show up
for client interviews,

00:41.642 --> 00:42.874
you make 'em believe they're hiring <i> us,</i>

00:42.910 --> 00:44.209
and for that,
you get a piece of the take.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.478
No one said you had to be part
of the investigations.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.346
Well, I just thought that
we would be helping people,

00:48.415 --> 00:49.714
saving people.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.483
You know, changing lives for the better.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.518
Watching this so doesn't feel like that.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.056
Well, that's the job, Sam.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.791
Background checks, lost pets,

00:59.827 --> 01:02.727
staking out a cheating jerk's
beach house at 4:00 a.m.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.433
Not like TV.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.565
We don't get front-page cases every week.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.867
You know, honestly...

01:08.902 --> 01:12.673
most detective work is like this... dull.

I-I didn't do it.

01:29.948 --> 01:31.515
Define "dull."

01:47.105 --> 01:48.505
I swear. You gotta believe me.

01:48.607 --> 01:50.607
I was in love with her. I didn't do this!

01:50.709 --> 01:51.941
I didn't shoot her!

01:52.043 --> 01:53.777
We practically caught him red-handed.

01:53.912 --> 01:55.478
How can he still deny it?

01:55.580 --> 01:57.184
They all do.

01:58.195 --> 01:59.460
Wait here.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.888
Vic's name is Daria Passmore,

02:04.990 --> 02:07.390
film student down at
San Bernardino University.

02:07.780 --> 02:08.679
And the shooter?

02:08.781 --> 02:10.580
Her teacher... Brad Marsh.

02:10.683 --> 02:13.984
B-movie producer, made a fortune
off those killer-puppet movies.

02:14.087 --> 02:16.120
Apparently, he's trying
to make art house films now.

02:16.222 --> 02:19.457
His soon-to-be-ex hired us to
provide proof of the affair.

02:19.559 --> 02:20.591
Oh, the poor stiff.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.460
He probably thought
he'd get away with it.

02:22.562 --> 02:25.229
But little did he know that
the legendary Detective McNair

02:25.331 --> 02:27.798
was lying in wait outside his window.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.533
He just seems so certain.

02:29.602 --> 02:31.569
Well, I guess you're not
the only thespian in the room.

02:31.637 --> 02:33.170
Then we heard gunfire.

02:33.272 --> 02:36.307
Ran in to find Mr. Marsh there
holding the weapon.

02:36.409 --> 02:37.808
I'm gonna need copies of those photos.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.276
Yeah, happy to...

02:39.378 --> 02:41.378
for a favor.

02:41.403 --> 02:44.170
I just... I wanna be the one to
tell our client what happened.

02:44.350 --> 02:45.549
I just think it'd be easier

02:45.651 --> 02:47.685
if she heard it from someone,
you know, she knows.

02:47.753 --> 02:49.520
I'm sure it has nothing to do
with you wanting to get paid

02:49.622 --> 02:51.956
before you client finds out
her husband killed his mistress,

02:52.024 --> 02:54.225
making your photos
pretty much unnecessary

02:54.293 --> 02:55.326
in her divorce case.

02:55.428 --> 02:57.495
No, that... that never crossed my mind.

02:57.597 --> 02:59.530
Two hours.

02:59.632 --> 03:02.833
How's your... nefarious plan
working out so far?

03:02.902 --> 03:04.101
A couple more shoe-leather cases,

03:04.203 --> 03:05.803
a few more overnights,
I'll be free of her.

03:05.905 --> 03:06.971
She's starting to get bored.

03:07.073 --> 03:08.472
She doesn't look bored.

03:08.541 --> 03:09.773
We will help you with this.

03:09.842 --> 03:12.376
Maybe you wanna get her away
from my murder suspect?

03:16.482 --> 03:17.481
Hey.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.077
What the hell are you doing?

03:19.146 --> 03:20.784
- Getting us a new client.
- What? Who?

03:20.887 --> 03:22.019
Brad Marsh. He said he didn't do it.

03:22.088 --> 03:23.654
He's hired us to prove it.

03:23.756 --> 03:25.233
Damn it, Sam.

03:25.302 --> 03:27.691
You cannot, should not ever take a case

03:27.760 --> 03:29.376
without talking to me.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.784
Well, you take cases
without talking to <i> me.</i>

03:30.853 --> 03:31.885
Because I know what I'm doing.

03:31.954 --> 03:33.120
Well,<i> I</i> know what you're doing, too.

03:33.222 --> 03:36.123
The guy was standing over
the victim's body

03:36.225 --> 03:37.324
holding the murder weapon.

03:37.393 --> 03:40.127
That is the literal definition
of "smoking gun."

03:40.195 --> 03:41.595
There's no case. He's guilty.

03:41.664 --> 03:42.729
No, he's not.

03:42.798 --> 03:44.431
Look, Eddie, I know
when someone's acting.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.334
Those tears were real.
H-His devastation was, too.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.335
He's innocent.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.070
Then explain the dead girl.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.956
Well, maybe someone else
was in the house...

03:51.981 --> 03:53.414
you know, someone we didn't see.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.083
Maybe the killer
was trying to set Brad up.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.618
You know what you're trying to do?

03:57.720 --> 04:00.388
You're just trying to make this case
more exciting than it actually is.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.622
We're not taking it.

04:01.724 --> 04:04.097
Well a girl died tonight, Eddie.

04:04.199 --> 04:05.419
Don't you want someone to pay?

04:05.454 --> 04:06.627
You know what I want more?

04:06.696 --> 04:09.997
Is for someone to pay me
and then to go home.

04:10.033 --> 04:13.373
So please, when we get to Mrs. Marsh's
house, let me do the talking.

04:13.442 --> 04:15.689
And do not, under any circumstances,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.113
tell her about the murder
until <i> after</i> we get paid.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.815
Got it?

04:26.117 --> 04:27.583
I knew it.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.127
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

04:33.230 --> 04:34.363
With me, on his first wife.

04:34.465 --> 04:35.497
Ah. Yeah.

04:35.599 --> 04:38.600
Well, here's the proof.

04:39.011 --> 04:40.844
I knew he wasn't at the beach house

04:40.880 --> 04:42.746
working on his new passion project.

04:42.848 --> 04:44.351
Well, he kind of was.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.677
Had a feeling you were
the right people for the job,

04:47.746 --> 04:49.545
given what <i> your</i> fiancÃ© did to you.

04:49.647 --> 04:50.913
Hmm.

04:50.982 --> 04:52.048
Out of curiosity,

04:52.117 --> 04:53.716
you were just getting home
when we were pulling up.

04:53.818 --> 04:55.985
Where were you coming from, Mrs. Marsh?

04:56.383 --> 04:58.450
Don't call me by his name. It's "Cindy."

04:58.475 --> 05:00.708
And... I had an early meeting.

05:00.733 --> 05:01.896
Who with?

05:01.965 --> 05:03.934
My therapist, if you must know.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.331
At 6:00 a.m.?

05:05.433 --> 05:06.771
That's a little early
for unburdening yourself

05:06.839 --> 05:08.406
on someone's couch.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.640
Excuse me.

05:13.557 --> 05:14.589
What are you doing?

05:14.658 --> 05:16.458
- Isn't it obvious?
- No.

05:16.526 --> 05:17.659
She's the killer.

05:17.727 --> 05:19.160
Did you look at her?
She's wearing all black...

05:19.229 --> 05:20.763
perfect for not being seen at night.

05:20.810 --> 05:22.744
She had motive,
access to the beach house.

05:22.846 --> 05:25.380
That story about her therapist?
I mean, come on.

05:25.415 --> 05:26.848
She's obviously
having an affair with him.

05:26.917 --> 05:29.117
How do I know?
Her shirt was on inside out.

05:29.185 --> 05:30.919
Those are walk-of-shame clothes.

05:30.987 --> 05:33.021
She killed Daria, set up her husband,

05:33.056 --> 05:35.089
and then went to
her lover's house to celebrate.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.591
The most genius part... she hired us

05:36.660 --> 05:38.693
so we would witness her husband
committing the murder.

05:38.762 --> 05:41.195
Murder? What murder?

05:42.406 --> 05:43.538
Um, Mrs. Mar...

05:43.607 --> 05:44.773
Cindy...

05:44.841 --> 05:46.141
maybe you should have a seat.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.748
I don't want to have a seat.
I want to know what's going on.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.975
Well, there was a shooting
at your beach house

05:52.077 --> 05:53.343
early this morning.

05:53.378 --> 05:56.479
And it appears that your husband
may have killed his lover.

05:56.548 --> 05:58.081
Oh, my God.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.428
Or someone else killed her
and your husband's being set up.

06:02.371 --> 06:03.536
Are you accusing me?

06:03.605 --> 06:04.704
No. Of course not.

06:04.806 --> 06:05.939
You are!

06:06.008 --> 06:07.974
That's why you asked where I was earlier.

06:08.043 --> 06:10.210
You two are supposed to be
working for <i> me.</i>

06:10.279 --> 06:11.611
Cindy! We...

06:11.713 --> 06:13.880
Get out. Get out of my house.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.141
Five minutes.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.400
You just had to be quiet
for five minutes.

06:19.425 --> 06:22.092
If she has nothing to hide,
why'd she get so upset?

06:22.117 --> 06:24.284
Because you practically
accused her of murder.

06:24.309 --> 06:26.976
You're supposed to be helping us
make money, not enemies.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.919
So we lost a client. Big deal.

06:29.047 --> 06:30.747
We have another one waiting for us

06:30.772 --> 06:33.039
who will pay us 10 times as much
to prove he's innocent.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.391
Except he's not.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.060
Fine. What if he's not?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.062
What's the worst that can happen...

06:38.164 --> 06:39.764
we take money from a guilty man?

06:39.832 --> 06:41.665
Isn't there justice in that?

06:47.795 --> 06:50.062
You must think I'm a terrible person,

06:50.164 --> 06:51.330
cheating on my wife.

06:51.398 --> 06:56.235
But being with Daria
was like I-I found something

06:56.303 --> 06:59.471
I never knew was missing...
something real.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.240
And... And now...

07:01.308 --> 07:04.712
I know what this looks like. I-I do.

07:04.737 --> 07:07.170
But I never would've hurt her.

07:07.272 --> 07:08.572
Alright. Can you, um...

07:08.674 --> 07:10.641
Why don't you just tell us
exactly what happened?

07:10.743 --> 07:13.076
We... We had been talking
about our future...

07:13.145 --> 07:16.279
about me leaving Cindy,
about us leaving town,

07:16.348 --> 07:19.629
about starting our lives
together somewhere else.

07:19.664 --> 07:22.339
A-And then we... we... we...
we fell onto the bed,

07:22.364 --> 07:23.897
and we turned off the light.

07:23.966 --> 07:25.199
We started kissing.

07:25.234 --> 07:27.668
And then Daria was yanked from my arms.

07:27.736 --> 07:29.636
And... And she tried to scream,
but her voice was muffled,

07:29.672 --> 07:31.638
like somebody had put their hand
over her mouth.

07:31.707 --> 07:32.973
And she was fighting.

07:33.008 --> 07:35.109
I tried to get to her,
but I got knocked off the bed.

07:35.177 --> 07:38.378
And then I... I heard the... the gunshot.

07:38.447 --> 07:40.894
And... And... And then the flash.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.753
I saw Daria fall back.

07:42.855 --> 07:45.967
I-I tried to get to her,
but I tripped over something.

07:45.995 --> 07:48.195
I reached down and... and...
and... and picked it up.

07:48.297 --> 07:49.163
The gun.

07:49.231 --> 07:50.597
That's when you came in the room.

07:53.002 --> 07:54.968
Who knew you were gonna be
at the beach house that night?

07:55.004 --> 07:55.969
No one.

07:56.038 --> 07:57.004
Not even your wife?

07:57.072 --> 07:59.373
As vindictive as Cindy is,

07:59.441 --> 08:02.509
she would never touch a gun,
let alone fire one.

08:02.578 --> 08:04.511
Besides, I had been tracking her phone.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.928
She was screwing her therapist
that night.

08:07.683 --> 08:10.557
Yeah. I knew. Can't say I cared.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.625
Do you know if Daria had any enemies

08:13.694 --> 08:15.327
or anyone who would've wanted her dead?

08:15.429 --> 08:16.661
No.

08:16.764 --> 08:20.279
But come to think of it,
she seemed very shaken up

08:20.313 --> 08:21.745
when she first came out to the house.

08:21.847 --> 08:23.080
I asked her what was wrong,

08:23.182 --> 08:24.915
and... and she just shrugged it off

08:24.951 --> 08:27.117
and said she wanted to talk
about the future

08:27.186 --> 08:29.520
and starting our lives together.

08:32.091 --> 08:33.924
Did you hear that? She was shaken up.

08:33.993 --> 08:34.991
She wanted to start a new life.

08:35.061 --> 08:36.527
Maybe she was running from something.

08:36.595 --> 08:38.328
Or maybe he's lying
so we'll take his case.

08:38.431 --> 08:39.395
Sam, he's using us.

08:39.498 --> 08:40.885
Wha... Using us? For what?

08:40.910 --> 08:42.277
He's laying the groundwork
for his defense.

08:42.379 --> 08:45.380
L-Like O.J. hiring those P.I.s
to find the "real killers"?

08:45.416 --> 08:47.149
Why do you immediately assume
the worst of people?

08:47.251 --> 08:48.617
Saves time.

08:48.686 --> 08:50.219
- Sam, I can prove it.
- How?

08:50.321 --> 08:52.020
He said that Daria
was struggling with the killer.

08:52.122 --> 08:54.156
If it was as violent as he said...

08:54.258 --> 08:57.125
There'd be DNA under her fingernails.

08:57.194 --> 08:58.393
Bingo.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.298
Victim is 23 years old,
appears to be in good health

09:03.367 --> 09:04.379
with the exception

09:04.404 --> 09:05.291
of the holes in her chest.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.668
And...

09:07.648 --> 09:09.881
Oh, my God. Sam Swift
just walked into my morgue.

09:09.906 --> 09:11.673
Please, Lord, remember
this moment. I've gotta go.

09:11.771 --> 09:13.204
Eddie! Sam.

09:13.229 --> 09:14.795
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have tidied up...

09:14.820 --> 09:16.086
or, at the very least, put the body away.

09:16.111 --> 09:18.311
Actually, it's the body that
we want to talk to you about.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.292
Oh.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.227
Right.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.863
I ran every test I could
trying to prove your theory,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.465
but there is no evidence
of defensive wounds,

09:27.501 --> 09:29.167
no evidence of a struggle of any kind.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.468
So no DNA under her nails?

09:30.571 --> 09:31.903
Just her boyfriend's.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.872
Honestly, if you two hadn't been
out there to hear the shots,

09:33.941 --> 09:35.140
I think he'd have probably carved her up

09:35.242 --> 09:36.308
and dumped her in the sea.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.043
Like I said, saves time.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.611
Mick, when we would find a body
on the show,

09:39.646 --> 09:41.375
we would always run their fingerprints.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.867
Yes, one of the delightfully
authentic aspects

09:43.969 --> 09:45.068
of your production.

09:45.171 --> 09:46.970
We don't need fingerprints.
We know who she is.

09:47.072 --> 09:48.238
Yeah, but how well?

09:48.307 --> 09:50.107
Maybe she has priors or a criminal past

09:50.209 --> 09:51.942
that would explain why she was killed.

09:52.044 --> 09:53.076
We know why she was killed.

09:53.179 --> 09:54.812
Her boyfriend was trying
to cover up his affair.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.435
Can I see the report?

09:56.504 --> 09:59.371
Oh, I'm not sure
we have it back, but, um...

09:59.473 --> 10:01.040
Oh!

10:01.142 --> 10:02.207
Yes. We have it.

10:02.309 --> 10:03.409
Right.

10:04.845 --> 10:06.345
So, I...

10:07.100 --> 10:08.080
Huh.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.782
"Huh"? "Huh," what?

10:09.884 --> 10:11.650
No, that can't be right.

10:11.752 --> 10:12.985
What?

10:13.054 --> 10:14.720
Her fingerprints...

10:14.789 --> 10:17.322
the system found a match,
but it's not to Daria Passmore.

10:17.425 --> 10:18.424
What are you talking about?

10:18.526 --> 10:20.159
She's not who she said she was.

10:20.261 --> 10:21.627
Well, who is she?

10:21.729 --> 10:23.762
Her name is Tina Flores.

10:23.864 --> 10:26.398
According to this,
she's been dead for eight years.

10:34.004 --> 10:37.237
Daria Passmore, AKA Tina Flores.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.162
Foster kid, frequent runaway.

10:39.230 --> 10:40.763
Raised in the kind of group homes I was.

10:40.832 --> 10:42.787
See? Criminal past.

10:42.812 --> 10:44.812
Yeah, but we're talking
petty theft, a couple of B&Es...

10:44.881 --> 10:45.980
nothing that would get her killed.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.515
Which time?

10:47.584 --> 10:49.951
So, how did she supposedly die?

10:50.020 --> 10:52.520
Indigo warehouse fire
in Oakland, eight years ago.

10:52.589 --> 10:53.855
Whoa. The Indigo fire?

10:53.890 --> 10:55.923
We did a ripped-from-
the-headlines episode on that.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.633
A bunch of runaways
and homeless kids died in it.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.324
Well, that's making it
the ideal opportunity

11:00.393 --> 11:02.460
for someone looking to
disappear to fake their death,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.095
steal a new identity, and start over.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.363
There's only one reason someone would

11:05.431 --> 11:06.530
go through that much trouble.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.965
She <i> was</i> running from something!

11:08.067 --> 11:09.800
Or, you know, maybe because of her record

11:09.836 --> 11:11.035
and her outstanding warrants,

11:11.070 --> 11:13.465
she saw an opportunity for a fresh start.

11:13.490 --> 11:15.623
Look me in the eye and tell me
you really believe that.

11:20.630 --> 11:21.930
Who's that?

11:21.998 --> 11:24.532
Oh, that's Monica, my new assistant.

11:24.634 --> 11:25.930
What? Whoa.

11:25.955 --> 11:27.521
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Timeout.

11:27.557 --> 11:30.157
Having an assistant is
definitely not part of our deal.

11:30.259 --> 11:33.333
You're not paying for her,
Scroogely. Neither am I.

11:33.358 --> 11:35.525
She's working in exchange
for living in my guest house.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.293
She's getting her psych PhD.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.362
She's putting stuff in my kitchen.

11:39.464 --> 11:40.585
<i>Our</i> kitchen.

11:40.620 --> 11:41.831
Your snacks suck.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.896
- Hey!
- Yo!

11:45.998 --> 11:48.764
So, I bought everything
that bordered on healthy.

11:48.789 --> 11:50.455
- This Eddie and Berto?
- Yep.

11:50.524 --> 11:53.091
Monica. Look forward to working with you.

11:53.127 --> 11:55.248
Sorry about the lights. I'm a grinder.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.731
- Grinder?
- A body hacker.

11:56.833 --> 11:57.899
I have implants in my hands

11:57.967 --> 12:00.002
that can affect electromagnetic fields.

12:00.027 --> 12:01.226
I'm basically a cyborg.

12:01.251 --> 12:02.483
And you're gonna be working here?

12:02.585 --> 12:04.018
Really? <i>That's</i> your takeaway?

12:04.087 --> 12:05.620
Dude, no. I'm completely mobile,

12:05.688 --> 12:07.655
and this situation is strictly part-time.

12:09.559 --> 12:12.293
You're disappointed. You like me.

12:13.263 --> 12:15.129
What? No.

12:15.231 --> 12:16.597
No.

12:16.666 --> 12:19.510
Part-time, full-time...
whatever's cool with me.

12:20.029 --> 12:21.262
Hm.

12:21.297 --> 12:22.262
I copied your key.

12:22.365 --> 12:23.597
Your mail's on the kitchen counter,

12:23.699 --> 12:24.932
and I brought you a fresh pair of socks

12:25.001 --> 12:26.834
in case you do another all-nighter.

12:26.869 --> 12:29.303
And hey, I called everyone on
the film-crew list you gave me

12:29.372 --> 12:31.538
who worked with that Brad Marsh guy.

12:31.574 --> 12:33.484
Before this, worst thing I unearthed

12:33.509 --> 12:34.875
is he likes younger women.

12:34.900 --> 12:35.966
No underage stories, though,

12:36.001 --> 12:37.667
and no one I talked to said "#MeToo."

12:37.770 --> 12:39.569
She's doing case research now?

12:39.671 --> 12:40.604
She is.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.547
Oh, and you asked me to remind you

12:42.572 --> 12:44.238
about that thing
you have downtown tomorrow.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.763
Um... can you just text me
a couple hours before?

12:46.788 --> 12:47.842
Yeah, no prob.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.876
Later, studs!

12:54.567 --> 12:55.600
I do kinda like her.

12:55.702 --> 12:56.634
Ju...

12:56.669 --> 12:58.202
Fix the damn lights, huh?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.706
What's this thing downtown?

13:01.774 --> 13:03.207
It's just a girl thing.

13:03.309 --> 13:05.109
Wait... where are you going?

13:05.178 --> 13:07.912
Talk to our client, see how much
he knew about his girlfriend.

13:07.981 --> 13:09.113
You're taking the case?

13:09.182 --> 13:10.915
- We're taking the case!
- Shut up.

13:10.984 --> 13:13.017
I don't understand.
Why didn't she tell me all this?

13:13.119 --> 13:14.773
Why... Why did she lie?

13:14.807 --> 13:16.173
Maybe she was trying to protect you.

13:16.209 --> 13:19.009
No! We told each other <i>everything.</i>

13:19.912 --> 13:22.112
At least... At least, I <i> thought</i> we did.

13:22.181 --> 13:24.515
You said she was upset when
she came to see you last night.

13:24.584 --> 13:26.217
What about before that,
in the last few weeks?

13:26.285 --> 13:28.185
Was she anxious or scared?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.483
No, more like distracted.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.319
She was pushing for me
to end things with Cindy

13:33.355 --> 13:34.887
so we could go out of town.

13:34.923 --> 13:37.763
We had tickets for CancÃºn
at the end of the week.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.259
What else can you tell us
about her life, hmm?

13:40.328 --> 13:42.528
People she hung out with, friends?

13:43.431 --> 13:46.499
I... I don't really know.

13:46.601 --> 13:47.667
How do you not know?

13:47.735 --> 13:49.742
You said you guys
were practically soul mates.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.862
Well, we were having an affair.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.997
We weren't ready for our friends to know.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.298
How about where she lived?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.867
We never went to her place.

13:55.902 --> 13:58.536
She said she was embarrassed
by how small it was.

13:59.031 --> 14:00.730
What <i> did</i> you know about her?

14:02.650 --> 14:04.516
Mr. Marsh, if you want us
to prove your innocence,

14:04.585 --> 14:05.885
we need a place to start.

14:05.953 --> 14:07.253
We have to figure out who she really was

14:07.321 --> 14:09.100
and why someone might've wanted her dead.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.424
What... What about her driver's license?

14:10.527 --> 14:11.792
Can't you get her address off of that?

14:11.861 --> 14:13.361
We checked. It's fake.

14:13.429 --> 14:14.395
I hate to say it,

14:14.464 --> 14:16.797
but it's almost like
you were dating a ghost.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.366
What we had was... was... was real.

14:18.434 --> 14:19.767
I know it was real!

14:21.130 --> 14:23.264
W-Wait. She ordered a Lyft.

14:23.332 --> 14:25.633
A few weeks ago, she ordered
a Lyft from my account.

14:25.668 --> 14:27.806
I insisted so she wouldn't have to pay.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.406
We're gonna need
your account and password.

14:29.508 --> 14:31.475
With any luck,
maybe we'll beat the cops there.

14:40.820 --> 14:44.121
It's creepy. It's like the house
doesn't know she's dead.

14:44.223 --> 14:45.656
Hey, house. She's dead.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.218
Now it knows.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.916
Burner phones... a lot of them.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.192
Whatever she was doing,
I'm pretty sure it wasn't legal.

14:57.263 --> 14:58.415
Eddie.

15:02.723 --> 15:04.355
A wig for every phone.

15:04.391 --> 15:07.275
These are real hair.
They cost thousands of dollars.

15:08.328 --> 15:11.185
Looks like Daria took
her disguises pretty seriously.

15:12.299 --> 15:14.165
Look at all that makeup.

15:14.234 --> 15:15.699
Disguises for what?

15:20.807 --> 15:23.408
Serial number's been filed away.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.164
Look at the IDs.

15:25.232 --> 15:27.869
All different looks, all different names.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.919
What do you think she's got in <i> there?</i>

15:39.663 --> 15:41.462
What are you hiding?

15:54.745 --> 15:56.111
Like 500 grand in here.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.580
Who'd this woman think she is,
Jason Bourne?

15:58.616 --> 15:59.915
Sam!

16:06.590 --> 16:07.523
Sorry.

16:10.628 --> 16:11.827
Sorry.

16:16.504 --> 16:18.304
This door's reinforced.
I can't break it down.

16:18.339 --> 16:20.006
Who do you think that was?
You think it was Daria's killer?

16:20.075 --> 16:21.441
I think it was Daria's killer.

16:21.543 --> 16:22.742
Who are you calling?

16:22.811 --> 16:24.310
Berto... see if he can
get us out of here.

16:24.379 --> 16:25.978
<i>What up? This is Berto. Leave a message.</i>

16:26.047 --> 16:27.713
Voicemail.

16:27.749 --> 16:29.682
You mean we're stuck?

16:29.989 --> 16:30.955
Hey, let us out!

16:31.024 --> 16:32.590
Hey! Shh! Stop! Shh.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.892
I'd rather the bad guy not
come back and try to kill us.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.874
Who are you texting?

16:41.942 --> 16:43.008
Monica, to see if she can help...

16:43.077 --> 16:44.543
unless you'd rather me
call your cop girlfriend.

16:44.645 --> 16:45.744
She's not my girlfriend.

16:45.813 --> 16:47.346
And the less she knows
about this, the better.

16:47.415 --> 16:49.406
Oh, yeah? Which part... breaking in

16:49.475 --> 16:51.950
or you being locked
alone in a closet with me?

16:52.019 --> 16:54.653
What, you think you're irresistible?

16:54.722 --> 16:57.541
Well, you do seem
pretty excited right now.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.984
That's my gun.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.120
Oh.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.803
Thank God.

17:10.838 --> 17:12.338
Bet you're glad I have an assistant <i> now.</i>

17:12.406 --> 17:14.073
Yeah, 'cause I've always wanted
to be rescued by an android.

17:14.175 --> 17:15.140
Cyborg.

17:15.209 --> 17:16.442
You're right... he <i> is</i> a buzzkill.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.176
So, is this kinda thing
part of my job description?

17:18.279 --> 17:19.545
'Cause if so, that's cool.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.480
Eddie, all the wigs... they're gone.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.233
Yeah, so's the gun and IDs.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.551
Burner phones and computer, too.

17:26.619 --> 17:28.520
He scrubbed the place.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.083
Well, whatever Daria was up to,

17:30.185 --> 17:31.651
he didn't want anyone to find out.

17:31.687 --> 17:32.819
Should I be taking notes?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.292
Now we have no leads.

17:34.361 --> 17:35.661
Maybe we do.

17:35.696 --> 17:37.629
We spent the last couple days
following her and Brad.

17:37.665 --> 17:38.712
Maybe there's some clue

17:38.737 --> 17:40.056
as to who she is in one
of those photos we took.

17:43.637 --> 17:45.437
Alright, what are we looking for?

17:45.506 --> 17:48.334
Anything unusual, out of the ordinary,

17:48.359 --> 17:49.764
something we might've missed.

17:49.866 --> 17:52.228
- Oh!
- What?

17:52.253 --> 17:53.619
My favorite ice cream place!

17:53.644 --> 17:55.644
They make it from scratch.
Super-pricy, though.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.234
What? It's awesome.

18:00.772 --> 18:02.471
Hey!

18:02.574 --> 18:06.424
There. You see it?

18:06.526 --> 18:07.537
See what?

18:07.606 --> 18:08.711
Same car.

18:10.188 --> 18:11.888
Oh, yeah! It's also at the cafÃ©.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.590
Three different locations,
three different days,

18:13.658 --> 18:14.924
and it doesn't belong to either of them.

18:15.026 --> 18:16.359
What's it mean?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.661
We weren't the only ones
following Brad and Daria.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.330
We need to zoom in, enhance the license,

18:20.398 --> 18:21.564
and track down the owner.

18:23.078 --> 18:25.112
Right. "Enhance"... not a thing.

18:25.181 --> 18:26.113
- It's not TV.
- Mm.

18:26.182 --> 18:27.347
- I'm sure you know that.
- Yeah.

18:27.416 --> 18:28.715
And we don't need to enhance it,

18:28.784 --> 18:30.684
because I know exactly whose car that is.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.117
Max Duchemin.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.353
Well, well, well.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.155
Eddie V.

18:45.224 --> 18:48.325
I guess what I read about you
in the papers is true, huh?

18:48.394 --> 18:49.693
You've gone Hollywood.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.062
And here, I thought
you didn't like the spotlight.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.231
- You two know each other?
- Oh, yeah.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.333
Eddie and me, we go way back, don't we?

18:56.802 --> 18:57.901
He didn't tell you about me?

18:57.969 --> 19:00.336
This dirtbag used to work for me
before he went solo.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.114
Would've made him partner, too,

19:02.183 --> 19:03.716
if not for the knife in my back.

19:03.784 --> 19:06.151
What do you want, V? A handout?

19:06.220 --> 19:07.920
Want me to throw a little work your way,

19:07.955 --> 19:09.121
for old times' sake?

19:09.190 --> 19:10.756
You were following this girl.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.890
Why?

19:13.444 --> 19:14.443
Maybe I was lonely.

19:14.545 --> 19:16.078
Maybe you deserve to be.

19:16.147 --> 19:17.813
Who hired you?

19:17.849 --> 19:19.515
You know, I didn't learn much from you,

19:19.584 --> 19:21.150
but I did learn how to keep a secret.

19:21.219 --> 19:23.319
And I don't talk about
my cases or my clients.

19:23.421 --> 19:25.421
Hey, pal, this girl is dead.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.256
So if you're protecting her killer,

19:27.458 --> 19:29.558
that makes you an accessory to murder.

19:29.660 --> 19:30.826
That's cute.

19:30.895 --> 19:33.429
You know, you were
a lot more believable on TV.

19:33.497 --> 19:34.563
I'll see ya around, V.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.471
What an asshat!

19:41.263 --> 19:42.629
He worked for you?

19:42.731 --> 19:43.897
<i>Predictable</i> asshat.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.932
He told us what we needed to know.

19:46.034 --> 19:47.233
He didn't tell us anything.

19:47.302 --> 19:49.969
He confirmed he was
following Daria for a client.

19:50.005 --> 19:52.272
- Well, so he knows something.
- Yep.

19:52.340 --> 19:54.941
The only way to find out what
would be risky and illegal.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.943
So there's nothing we can do?

19:57.045 --> 19:57.977
I didn't say that.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.225
Really? You brought me to a bar?

20:12.294 --> 20:13.827
You do know I'm in recovery, right?

20:13.929 --> 20:15.429
We're not here to do shots.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.699
You.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.936
I should rip you in half,
Valetik, for what you did to me.

20:23.005 --> 20:24.738
W-What'd you do to him?

20:25.140 --> 20:27.206
I talked him into buying this bar.

20:27.275 --> 20:30.004
And now every month, I gotta do
all this damn paperwork.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.146
Eddie, I hate paperwork.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.251
Samantha Swift!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.842
O-kay. Alright.

20:41.115 --> 20:44.038
It's about time he brought you around.

20:44.063 --> 20:45.796
This is Zeus. He's kinda shy.

20:45.821 --> 20:47.754
Eddie tell you he's alive today
because of me, hmm?

20:47.949 --> 20:49.248
No, no, because I haven't told her

20:49.273 --> 20:51.206
<i>you're</i> alive because of <i> me.</i>

20:51.328 --> 20:53.668
- Zeus is my old partner from the force.
- Ah.

20:53.668 --> 20:55.167
He runs a high-end
security consulting firm now.

20:55.236 --> 20:57.169
He's big-time... corporate alarm systems,

20:57.272 --> 20:59.372
surveillance systems, firewalls.

20:59.474 --> 21:01.040
When I'm not running this damn bar.

21:01.142 --> 21:03.517
You love this bar.
You met your wife in this bar.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.378
I know that two of your kids,
they were conceived right...

21:05.480 --> 21:07.413
I... think the lady
gets the picture, hmm?

21:07.438 --> 21:09.138
- You love this bar.
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.317 --> 21:11.550
So, is this a social call?

21:11.653 --> 21:12.852
Business.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.887
There's this office
in a high-security building.

21:14.989 --> 21:16.976
Kinda need your help getting in.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.071
Eddie, you know I can't...

21:18.096 --> 21:19.720
Ask me whose office.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.088
Whose office?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.796
Max Duchemin.

21:23.265 --> 21:24.565
Duchemin?

21:26.246 --> 21:27.835
Oh, that sounds like fun.

21:30.461 --> 21:31.393
Here's what you're facing.

21:32.154 --> 21:34.129
Duchemin's office is in Wycroft Tower.

21:34.169 --> 21:37.261
Other tenants include banks,
law offices, tech firms...

21:37.301 --> 21:38.600
making the building highly secure.

21:38.669 --> 21:40.035
How secure?

21:40.070 --> 21:42.237
The building sports a networked
IVS surveillance system...

21:42.306 --> 21:43.939
all entry points, every floor.

21:44.007 --> 21:45.674
Elevators are keycard-controlled.

21:45.743 --> 21:48.377
The main office has
a C27 multi-point alarm system.

21:48.412 --> 21:49.644
It sounds impossible.

21:50.104 --> 21:51.837
He always makes it sound impossible.

21:51.906 --> 21:54.673
Makes him seem more impressive
when he actually gets us in.

21:54.742 --> 21:56.704
Don't give away all my secrets, dawg.

21:56.729 --> 21:57.795
So, how do we get in?

21:57.830 --> 21:59.931
I rep the alarm company, so that's easy.

21:59.999 --> 22:01.566
I can spoof the elevator keycard.

22:01.634 --> 22:03.367
LED cap should blind surveillance.

22:03.436 --> 22:05.703
But there's one thing
I can't help you with...

22:05.738 --> 22:07.405
the night guard in the lobby.

22:07.473 --> 22:10.569
In order to get to the elevators,
you have to get past him.

22:10.594 --> 22:12.227
He also monitors the camera feed,

22:12.329 --> 22:13.995
so he'll see any tampering.

22:14.064 --> 22:16.348
A night guard? That's what
you're worried about?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.485
You know how they caught
the Watergate burglars?

22:18.520 --> 22:20.487
It wasn't an alarm system or cameras.

22:20.556 --> 22:23.023
It was a night guard.
He spotted tape on the door.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.225
Human assets are
the hardest variable to control.

22:25.294 --> 22:28.094
Yeah, well,
we have something they didn't.

22:28.197 --> 22:29.763
Me.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.921
Hey! Are you okay?

23:06.568 --> 23:07.700
Hey!

23:07.769 --> 23:09.469
Can you hear me?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.290
Am I dead?

23:13.359 --> 23:14.925
Are you an angel?

23:14.994 --> 23:16.860
No, ma'am. I think you passed out.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.696
Maybe you had
a little t-too much to drink?

23:21.367 --> 23:22.532
No!

23:22.668 --> 23:24.368
I am... not drunk.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.722
I am <i> so</i> not drunk.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.046
I-I know how this looks, okay?

23:29.216 --> 23:31.282
You don't know. You can't understand!

23:32.385 --> 23:34.552
This night has been a disaster.

23:34.849 --> 23:35.915
Is there someone I can call for you?

23:35.983 --> 23:37.049
No! No, no!

23:37.151 --> 23:38.451
Don't call him!

23:38.486 --> 23:40.352
What I need... I need to charge my phone

23:40.455 --> 23:42.054
a-a-and call a Lyft.

23:42.123 --> 23:45.491
But not back to his place,
because he ruined it!

23:47.601 --> 23:49.601
I am <i> not</i> talking to him.

23:52.206 --> 23:55.541
I'm sorry, but it's after hours.
You have to leave.

23:55.609 --> 23:56.642
Who says I have to go?

23:56.710 --> 23:58.076
Ma'am. Peters.

23:58.179 --> 23:59.611
Ma'am!

23:59.680 --> 24:01.213
- Peters.
- Ma'am?

24:09.890 --> 24:12.491
Keep away from Peters!

24:15.396 --> 24:16.361
Ma'am!

24:16.430 --> 24:17.729
- Peters! Ohh!
- That's it!

24:17.798 --> 24:19.566
I'm calling the police.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.221
Oh, please, please don't.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.422
You seem like a nice guy.

24:26.491 --> 24:28.357
I really need nice right now.

24:28.426 --> 24:29.825
Okay, I've had a bad night.

24:29.894 --> 24:32.060
You don't even know
what I've been through.

24:32.094 --> 24:33.694
Let me tell you, Peters.

24:43.411 --> 24:44.610
Okay, you're on.

24:44.679 --> 24:47.046
So, you and Sam... how's that goin'?

24:47.115 --> 24:48.363
She's like a circus

24:48.388 --> 24:49.506
that never leaves town.

24:51.186 --> 24:52.852
Come on, brother.
Who doesn't like a circus?

24:52.921 --> 24:54.720
Mm-hmm.

24:54.789 --> 24:58.090
And... you are welcome.

25:00.128 --> 25:02.895
And then, not only did he dump me,

25:02.997 --> 25:04.764
he left me at the club!

25:05.087 --> 25:07.288
Can you believe that?
Why would he do that?

25:16.139 --> 25:18.041
I got it. I'm heading down.

25:19.876 --> 25:22.176
Sam, he's coming down.

25:22.245 --> 25:23.845
Keep the guard away from the elevator.

25:23.947 --> 25:25.580
Look, lady.

25:25.682 --> 25:28.282
I'm really sorry
you had a bad night, okay?

25:28.318 --> 25:31.886
But I could lose my job here,
so this is your last chance.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.740
Get down, or I'm gonna call the police.

25:36.310 --> 25:37.343
Fine.

25:45.152 --> 25:47.207
That's it! Out... now!

25:47.234 --> 25:48.967
Wh... Oh! No, no! Lemme go! Lemme go!

25:49.069 --> 25:50.077
Oh, c'mon, Peters!

25:50.180 --> 25:52.070
Oh, let go! Let go of me!

25:52.172 --> 25:53.238
I thought we were cool!

25:53.340 --> 25:55.040
Oh!

25:56.410 --> 25:58.610
Aah!

25:58.712 --> 26:00.512
Sorry, Peters! I had no choice!

26:00.614 --> 26:02.514
Aaaaah!

26:06.520 --> 26:09.487
You were supposed to keep him
occupied, not Mace him.

26:09.590 --> 26:11.756
I improvised! And it was hair spray.

26:11.858 --> 26:13.291
Where's the file?

26:14.494 --> 26:16.861
So, Duchemin was hired to follow Daria

26:16.964 --> 26:18.597
by a man named Jace Buckner.

26:18.699 --> 26:22.033
I Googled his name,
and this photo came up.

26:22.135 --> 26:23.234
Look familiar?

26:23.337 --> 26:25.804
Whoa. That's the guy
who locked us in the closet.

26:31.234 --> 26:32.634
Jace Buckner... he's vice president

26:32.703 --> 26:34.536
of product sales at Simon Industries.

26:34.605 --> 26:36.037
Married, two kids.

26:36.106 --> 26:37.205
Simon Industries...

26:37.274 --> 26:38.907
don't they make
those TrueTrash trash cans?

26:38.976 --> 26:42.177
Yeah. So what's the V.P.
of trash doing following Daria?

26:42.245 --> 26:43.898
What's he doing locking us in a closet?

26:43.923 --> 26:45.823
As far as I can tell,
their lives didn't intersect.

26:45.892 --> 26:48.465
The only commonality is
they both have criminal records.

26:49.562 --> 26:51.228
Before his life as a husband, father,

26:51.297 --> 26:53.667
and vice president of wastebaskets

26:53.695 --> 26:54.794
at daddy-in-law's company,

26:54.863 --> 26:56.196
Buckner here had multiple arrests.

26:56.264 --> 26:57.297
For what?

26:57.366 --> 26:59.666
Uh, possession with intent to distribute.

26:59.735 --> 27:01.868
He was selling drugs? What kind?

27:01.903 --> 27:04.804
Luxury, not street...
Coke, X, Study Buddies.

27:04.873 --> 27:05.905
Got his start young.

27:06.007 --> 27:07.984
He was the Pablo Escobar
of his prep school.

27:08.777 --> 27:11.211
That's what this is about.

27:11.279 --> 27:13.847
Burner phones, cash, the gun...

27:14.216 --> 27:16.016
it all screams "drug dealer."

27:16.085 --> 27:19.119
Maybe Jace was still into drugs
and Daria was his supplier.

27:19.155 --> 27:22.156
Yeah, I know, but why hire
Duchemin to follow Daria?

27:22.557 --> 27:25.125
Well, maybe she and Jace
were working together

27:25.227 --> 27:26.993
and they had a falling-out.

27:27.095 --> 27:29.195
Maybe Jace hired Duchemin
to track her movements

27:29.297 --> 27:30.597
to gain the upper hand.

27:30.945 --> 27:31.944
Ooh!

27:32.138 --> 27:33.504
And then, when he found out

27:33.529 --> 27:35.096
that she was having an affair
with a married man,

27:35.241 --> 27:36.340
he had a way to get rid of her

27:36.376 --> 27:38.515
by making Brad Marsh the fall guy.

27:40.213 --> 27:41.345
What?

27:41.448 --> 27:43.481
I'm sorry. It's just...

27:43.583 --> 27:44.816
you look like Beetlejuice.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.015
You know I'm right.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.484
Either way, Jace wanted
something from Daria.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.519
I think it's time we ask him what.

27:58.993 --> 28:00.693
Thanks, everyone.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.718
Monthly projections on my desk by Friday.

28:03.758 --> 28:04.924
Mr. Buckner.

28:04.959 --> 28:06.859
There are a couple of people
here to see you.

28:06.928 --> 28:09.896
Said they met you at
a closet organizers convention.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.446
Yeah, you know the one...

28:11.514 --> 28:13.314
where you locked us in a closet?

28:14.651 --> 28:16.017
Who are you... cops?

28:16.086 --> 28:17.352
Private investigators.

28:17.454 --> 28:19.053
But the cops...
they're gonna be our next call

28:19.122 --> 28:20.521
if you don't answer our questions.

28:20.590 --> 28:23.825
Now, what's your relationship
to Daria Passmore?

28:23.893 --> 28:26.928
You want to know the nature
of our relationship?

28:27.455 --> 28:28.721
She was blackmailing me.

28:31.660 --> 28:34.360
But when I knew her,
her name was Vickie Westbrook.

28:34.429 --> 28:35.829
We met at a sales conference.

28:35.897 --> 28:37.512
She made me feel...

28:37.537 --> 28:39.203
- Special?
- Yeah.

28:39.305 --> 28:40.805
But then came the pictures.

28:40.873 --> 28:42.706
- Pictures?
- Of us in bed.

28:42.742 --> 28:44.763
She threatened to send them to my wife.

28:44.788 --> 28:46.922
I... I would've lost everything.

28:46.957 --> 28:48.156
Maybe you should've thought about that

28:48.181 --> 28:49.781
before you slept with her.

28:49.806 --> 28:51.473
- Well, what did she want?
- Money.

28:51.662 --> 28:53.228
A few thousand at first, then a lot more.

28:53.297 --> 28:54.463
I couldn't keep up with the payments,

28:54.531 --> 28:55.631
and I couldn't go to the police

28:55.699 --> 28:57.332
because I would've had to
admit the affair.

28:57.401 --> 28:58.400
Is that why you killed her...

28:58.502 --> 28:59.801
so she couldn't destroy your family?

28:59.870 --> 29:01.570
I told you I didn't kill her.

29:01.639 --> 29:03.138
I was with my folks that night, alright?

29:03.240 --> 29:04.206
There were witnesses.

29:07.311 --> 29:08.510
Sorry.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.097
Why'd you hire Duchemin?

29:11.199 --> 29:12.432
To find out where she lived.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.768
She was bleeding me dry.
I had to get the evidence back.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.503
But... But then,
the weirdest thing happened.

29:16.538 --> 29:17.765
Sh...

29:20.328 --> 29:21.360
Sorry... you were saying?

29:21.463 --> 29:23.196
A couple of days ago, Vickie called me.

29:23.264 --> 29:24.330
She said it was over.

29:24.432 --> 29:25.698
She said she was done with the blackmail

29:25.767 --> 29:27.567
and she was gonna burn all the evidence.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.419
She said she was sorry.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.309
Wait... your blackmailer apologized?

29:31.411 --> 29:33.044
Why the sudden change of heart?

29:33.113 --> 29:34.412
No idea.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.748
But I've never felt so relieved
in all my life.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.216
Then why were you at her apartment?

29:38.285 --> 29:40.819
Duchemin calls me.
He says she's been murdered.

29:40.888 --> 29:43.788
All I could think about was
the police finding the photos.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.932
When I saw you there, I... I panicked.

29:45.968 --> 29:47.801
You locked us in. You took everything.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.336
That's how I found out about the others.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.012
Others?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.873
I went through her phones, her laptop.

29:55.898 --> 29:58.332
I wasn't the only one
that she was blackmailing.

29:58.388 --> 29:59.787
You want a suspect?

29:59.929 --> 30:01.295
There were dozens of us.

30:01.524 --> 30:02.757
We're gonna need you to hand over

30:02.859 --> 30:04.792
everything that you took from her place.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.024
Gotta admire her stamina.

30:19.093 --> 30:20.425
And her business savvy.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.529
She had over $2 million in the bank.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.167
You okay?

30:29.236 --> 30:31.970
I just keep wondering which one
of these girls she really was.

30:32.006 --> 30:33.557
What was she running from?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.315
I don't know. Maybe she was
running from <i> herself.</i>

30:35.959 --> 30:37.392
Something in her life must've changed,

30:37.460 --> 30:38.660
'cause I just got off the phone

30:38.728 --> 30:40.280
with Daria's other blackmail victims.

30:40.281 --> 30:41.547
They all had the same story...

30:41.649 --> 30:43.248
Daria had called them
just before she died

30:43.317 --> 30:44.650
and let them all off the hook.

30:44.685 --> 30:46.881
She was getting out of the game. Why?

30:46.949 --> 30:49.651
I don't know, but I'm pretty sure
it had to do with Brad Marsh.

30:49.698 --> 30:50.664
What do you mean?

30:50.733 --> 30:52.505
Well, she was blackmailing all these men.

30:52.506 --> 30:54.216
Why not Brad? He has money.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.240
And why was she so eager to leave town,

30:55.308 --> 30:58.143
but not <i> so</i> eager that she
didn't just leave without him?

30:58.245 --> 30:59.778
Maybe she did love him.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.682
Yeah, I don't think that was it.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.050
I went through her e-mails
and found this.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.284
It's from an anonymous account.

31:04.353 --> 31:06.186
They claim to have hacked
her laptop and stole enough

31:06.288 --> 31:07.955
to bring her entire
blackmail scheme to light.

31:08.057 --> 31:09.323
They were gonna turn it over to the cops

31:09.425 --> 31:10.858
if she didn't do exactly what they said.

31:10.926 --> 31:12.059
Did it say what they were after?

31:12.127 --> 31:14.328
To run her honey-trapping scheme
on Brad Marsh.

31:14.430 --> 31:15.495
Why?

31:15.790 --> 31:16.923
Sounds like spy stuff.

31:16.991 --> 31:19.492
They wanted her to infiltrate his life,

31:19.594 --> 31:20.626
gather information.

31:20.695 --> 31:22.728
But the guy makes killer-puppet movies.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.630
What kind of information
could he possibly have?

31:24.732 --> 31:26.632
Don't know. Details were handled
with a phone call.

31:26.701 --> 31:29.569
But when she refused,
they threatened to kill her.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.271
Even sent photos of her sleeping

31:31.339 --> 31:33.306
just to prove that
they can get to her at any time.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.241
Well, that's not terrifyingly creepy.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.243
There's no indication in there
what they were after?

31:37.345 --> 31:39.712
Look at these follow-up e-mails
from the same account.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.014
Came a week ago.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.919
"Did you get the information
on C.D. yet?"

31:47.389 --> 31:49.923
Two days later, "Anything on C.D.?"

31:50.025 --> 31:51.157
I swept her hard drive...

31:51.259 --> 31:53.893
no other mention of "C.D."
anywhere else on her laptop.

31:53.995 --> 31:54.964
But, Eddie, I think

31:54.989 --> 31:56.386
this is why she was killed.

31:56.465 --> 31:57.797
Well, who's C.D.?

31:57.899 --> 31:59.132
I bet Brad Marsh knows.

31:59.201 --> 32:00.200
Valetik Investigations.

32:00.743 --> 32:02.643
Uh, Sam. Yep.

32:02.745 --> 32:03.944
It's Monica.

32:04.013 --> 32:05.612
Why's she calling me here?

32:06.903 --> 32:08.803
Hello?

32:08.828 --> 32:10.962
No, my phone was off. Why?

32:12.534 --> 32:13.834
Oh!

32:13.956 --> 32:15.655
God, no! I... I totally forgot.

32:15.744 --> 32:17.077
I'm coming. You tell them I'm coming?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.437
This is bad. This is really bad!

32:19.628 --> 32:20.827
Why? What'd you forget?

32:20.852 --> 32:22.651
Remember that thing downtown
I said wasn't a big deal?

32:22.676 --> 32:23.876
Well, it was a really big deal!

32:23.901 --> 32:25.334
Well, what is it?
What are you talking about?

32:25.634 --> 32:27.467
My probation hearing!

32:31.512 --> 32:33.078
Miss Swift, don't for a second think

32:33.114 --> 32:34.913
that your celebrity status
gives you permission

32:34.982 --> 32:37.416
to ignore the obligations
of your probation.

32:37.451 --> 32:39.643
I don't. Your Honor, I am sorry.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.467
I had every intention of being here.

32:41.536 --> 32:43.069
I'm not interested in excuses,

32:43.138 --> 32:45.071
and you've shown remorse before...

32:45.106 --> 32:47.533
like how sorry you were
at your first DUI hearing,

32:47.602 --> 32:49.459
only to have
your alcohol bracelet trigger

32:49.495 --> 32:52.070
that very same night
at an MTV after-party.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.495
I see no reason why the court
should give you another chance.

32:54.531 --> 32:56.931
Your Honor,
Miss Swift has done everything

32:57.000 --> 32:58.366
this court has asked for.

32:58.401 --> 32:59.801
She's found gainful employment.

32:59.870 --> 33:01.887
Yes, we've all read the headlines.

33:01.912 --> 33:03.211
And she successfully completed

33:03.247 --> 33:06.481
her court-mandated alcohol
and substance abuse treatment.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.450
She's maintained her sobriety since.

33:08.552 --> 33:09.584
Really?

33:09.687 --> 33:11.053
Then why do I have photos of her

33:11.121 --> 33:13.622
coming out of a bar
in the middle of the day?

33:15.859 --> 33:19.327
Oh, no. N... Your Honor.
That is not what it looks like.

33:19.395 --> 33:21.796
Do you know how many times a day
I hear that?

33:22.041 --> 33:24.441
It seems to me the best way to
get your attention, Miss Swift,

33:24.476 --> 33:26.944
is for you to spend the rest
of your sentence in prison.

33:27.012 --> 33:30.250
In the case of the State of
California vs. Samantha Swift,

33:30.319 --> 33:32.642
the defendant is to be
remanded into custody

33:32.678 --> 33:33.598
and ordered to serve
the rest of her pro...

33:33.623 --> 33:34.699
Your Honor, wait.

33:36.962 --> 33:39.730
Mr. Valetik. Haven't seen you in a while.

33:39.832 --> 33:41.699
You have something to add?

33:41.767 --> 33:44.168
I led her to that bar.

33:44.203 --> 33:46.887
We were working a case.
No alcohol was consumed.

33:46.912 --> 33:48.779
She still violated
the terms of her parole

33:48.848 --> 33:50.047
by missing her court date.

33:50.082 --> 33:52.182
She lost track of time because
she was gathering evidence

33:52.251 --> 33:54.151
to prove our client's innocence.

33:54.220 --> 33:55.585
She missed her court date

33:55.654 --> 33:57.276
because she was pursuing justice.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.568
The people who took those photos,

33:59.637 --> 34:01.639
they follow her around all the time,

34:01.741 --> 34:03.059
hoping that she'll screw up.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.307
And if she doesn't, they're just
gonna make it look like she did.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.143
Who can live with that kind of scrutiny?

34:07.650 --> 34:08.783
I know <i> I</i> couldn't.

34:10.141 --> 34:11.741
Now, is she disruptive? Yes.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.775
Annoying? Absolutely.

34:13.878 --> 34:15.203
But...

34:15.880 --> 34:18.047
she's trying...

34:18.348 --> 34:20.215
just about as hard
as I've ever seen anybody

34:20.317 --> 34:21.783
try and turn her life around.

34:23.487 --> 34:26.452
Your Honor, you've known me
since I was a rookie cop.

34:26.478 --> 34:28.178
Have I ever stood up for anybody

34:28.246 --> 34:30.280
who didn't deserve another chance?

34:34.138 --> 34:35.971
My instincts tell me that time in jail

34:36.040 --> 34:37.773
would do you a world of good.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.109
But if Eddie Valetik is willing
to vouch for you,

34:40.143 --> 34:42.010
then I'm willing to let you off
with a warning,

34:42.079 --> 34:44.580
under one condition...

34:45.024 --> 34:47.974
she remain in your employ for
the duration of her probation...

34:48.007 --> 34:49.741
- six months.
- Your Honor.

34:49.810 --> 34:50.909
It's the court's opinion that

34:50.978 --> 34:53.378
Miss Swift is in serious need
of boundaries.

34:53.414 --> 34:56.415
So either I sentence her to jail

34:56.483 --> 34:58.750
or I sentence her to <i> you,</i> Mr. Valetik.

34:58.853 --> 34:59.952
Your choice.

35:08.935 --> 35:09.934
What?

35:11.275 --> 35:13.576
Nobody's ever stood up for me
like that before.

35:13.678 --> 35:14.643
Thank you.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.180
Yeah, well, don't be too grateful.

35:17.248 --> 35:19.115
It was a business decision.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.017
Couldn't have you making me look bad.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.720
Of course.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.972
If you're done with all this nonsense,

35:27.074 --> 35:28.307
can we get back to the case?

35:28.376 --> 35:29.441
Mm-hmm.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.463
I can't believe I was such a fool.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.765
I don't suppose you want
our tickets to CancÃºn tonight?

35:36.834 --> 35:37.900
I'd have gone myself,

35:37.968 --> 35:40.836
but I surrendered my passport
when I made bail.

35:41.318 --> 35:42.917
Brad, I know how hard this must be.

35:42.986 --> 35:45.753
I was about to upend my life
for this girl.

35:45.855 --> 35:47.522
Someone coerced her into dating you.

35:47.591 --> 35:48.590
They wanted something.

35:48.658 --> 35:49.724
Look.

35:49.793 --> 35:51.059
Brad, this is important.

35:51.127 --> 35:53.954
Do you know anyone or anything
with the initials C.D.?

35:54.023 --> 35:55.730
Something worth killing for?

35:55.799 --> 35:57.398
No, I...

35:57.467 --> 35:59.968
Oh, my God. C.D.?

35:59.993 --> 36:01.193
What? What's C.D.?

36:02.930 --> 36:04.496
Carlina Del Rio.

36:04.565 --> 36:06.965
She's the ex-girlfriend
of Fernando Salazar.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.133
Fernando Salazar?

36:08.202 --> 36:10.035
Godfather of
the Guadalajaran Drug Cartel?

36:10.070 --> 36:11.903
W-Wait. I thought he was in prison.

36:11.972 --> 36:13.739
He <i> is...</i> because of Carlina's testimony.

36:13.774 --> 36:16.149
The Feds put her in Witness Protection.
You know her?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.240
I bought her life rights for a movie...

36:18.276 --> 36:21.711
my chance to be something more
than the killer-puppet guy.

36:21.779 --> 36:24.647
We... We would meet in secret
to go over the screenplay

36:24.749 --> 36:26.148
in places the FBI didn't know about.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.551
But once she trusted me,
we met at <i> her</i> place.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.651
And Salazar suspected.

36:30.676 --> 36:31.942
But he knew you wouldn't betray her

36:32.011 --> 36:33.443
if he confronted you directly,

36:33.479 --> 36:36.179
so he sent Daria
to burrow into your life,

36:36.248 --> 36:38.048
to find a clue to Carlina's whereabouts.

36:38.117 --> 36:40.450
If Salazar finds her, do you
know what he'll do to her?

36:40.519 --> 36:42.252
Torture and kill her. Where is she?

36:46.158 --> 36:48.492
Place has been tossed.
Somebody's already been here.

36:58.460 --> 36:59.567
She's not here.

36:59.636 --> 37:00.607
Eddie.

37:02.351 --> 37:03.951
- Is that flight information?
- Yeah.

37:04.053 --> 37:05.652
Look, the tickets are booked
under "Ellen Holder,"

37:05.721 --> 37:07.387
Carlina's Witness Protection name.

37:07.456 --> 37:09.523
She's out of town.
She still may be alive.

37:09.592 --> 37:12.893
Yeah, well, not for long.
She's flying back tonight.

37:12.962 --> 37:14.962
I think I know why
Daria wanted to go to CancÃºn.

37:15.064 --> 37:16.563
I just checked the plane's manifest.

37:16.599 --> 37:18.232
There's an Ellen Holder on that flight.

37:18.267 --> 37:20.910
And, Sam, you were right...
it arrives at the same terminal

37:20.935 --> 37:22.835
that Daria and Brad were
supposed to leave from tonight.

37:22.903 --> 37:24.770
<i>Daria knew she was signing
Carlina's death warrant</i>

37:24.839 --> 37:26.772
by sharing that information.
She couldn't live with it.

37:26.841 --> 37:27.940
She planned that CancÃºn trip

37:28.009 --> 37:29.842
so she could meet Carlina
as she got off the plane.

37:29.910 --> 37:31.343
Because Daria was trying
to save her life.

37:31.368 --> 37:32.544
Hey, Berto, when does that plane land?

37:32.569 --> 37:33.793
<i>11 minutes.</i>

37:47.723 --> 37:49.423
Eddie, the plane just landed.

37:49.492 --> 37:51.625
We're still 20 minutes away.
We're not gonna make it.

38:41.124 --> 38:42.457
His name's Juan Benero.

38:42.526 --> 38:45.844
He's a sicario for the Salazar
cartel... 28 known hits.

38:45.913 --> 38:49.097
You had called me a minute
later, it would've been 29.

38:49.132 --> 38:51.499
Daria's the one who saved her.

38:51.568 --> 38:54.265
Despite everything
she'd done in her past,

38:54.290 --> 38:57.391
she decided to risk her life
to save someone else.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.927
Do you still believe Brad killed her?

38:59.995 --> 39:02.262
Ohh. You want me to say it, don't you?

39:02.364 --> 39:03.804
Is it so hard?

39:03.906 --> 39:04.909
Yes.

39:05.835 --> 39:07.100
Fine.

39:07.169 --> 39:09.203
You were right... Brad didn't kill Daria.

39:09.271 --> 39:10.637
It was a setup.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.606
And?

39:12.708 --> 39:14.241
And?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.469
If I hadn't been there...

39:18.173 --> 39:20.673
And if you hadn't been there
the night Daria was shot,

39:20.742 --> 39:23.509
Carlina would be possibly dead, too.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.211
And most impressive...

39:25.280 --> 39:27.080
she got you to admit you were wrong.

39:28.350 --> 39:29.882
I'd say my work here is done.

39:32.554 --> 39:34.671
So, I guess your plan backfired.

39:34.696 --> 39:35.762
Whatcha gonna do now?

39:35.830 --> 39:37.363
Suffer.

39:37.432 --> 39:40.066
If you need consoling later,
come by my place.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.277
And near as we can figure,
Daria got on Salazar's radar

39:58.379 --> 39:59.879
when she ran one of her schemes

39:59.948 --> 40:02.281
on someone connected to his organization.

40:02.350 --> 40:04.984
They knew they could use her
to target you.

40:05.053 --> 40:06.619
We spoke to the D.A.

40:07.031 --> 40:09.298
Juan's rental car mapped a trip
to your beach house

40:09.366 --> 40:10.833
the night of the murder.

40:10.868 --> 40:13.728
It's enough evidence to dismiss
all charges against you.

40:15.332 --> 40:17.232
I know I should be relieved,

40:17.415 --> 40:20.716
but knowing that she lost
her life because of me...

40:20.785 --> 40:22.651
You did not kill Daria.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.420
In fact, I think it was <i> because</i> of you

40:24.488 --> 40:26.956
that she decided to put
all of her schemes behind her

40:27.058 --> 40:28.457
and become a better person.

40:28.559 --> 40:30.225
The only reason she was even with me

40:30.294 --> 40:32.194
was because she was forced to.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.263
I'm not so sure.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.233
I've been trying to make sense of it...

40:38.336 --> 40:42.371
why this coldhearted blackmailer
would risk her life,

40:42.440 --> 40:45.541
why she would call all
of her victims and apologize.

40:45.643 --> 40:48.077
It's because something changed her.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.722
I think it was you.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.181
With all that money she had,

40:52.283 --> 40:54.149
she could've disappeared on her own.

40:54.251 --> 40:55.884
But she didn't.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.438
Why?

40:58.189 --> 41:01.623
Because she wanted to leave with <i> you.</i>

41:01.726 --> 41:05.327
She planned to start a new life with <i> you.</i>

41:05.429 --> 41:08.831
And the only explanation I can think of

41:08.933 --> 41:11.166
is that she really did love you.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.371
Thank you.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.179
This seems so final.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.749
It's a bad idea to get emotional
in cases like this.

41:28.851 --> 41:30.998
How can I not?

41:31.100 --> 41:34.185
Daria, Tina, Victoria...

41:34.287 --> 41:36.033
You know, I understand how hard it is

41:36.136 --> 41:38.336
when you have to play
a lot of roles to survive.

41:38.404 --> 41:41.301
It's easy to lose a grip on who you are.

41:41.326 --> 41:44.227
Sounds like she finally
figured it out with Brad.

41:44.329 --> 41:45.528
She did.

41:45.631 --> 41:47.130
She found true love.

41:47.199 --> 41:48.932
She saved the day.

41:49.034 --> 41:50.900
Hey, look at you,
pointing out the bright side.

41:51.003 --> 41:52.702
Mnh. Yeah, didn't mean to.

41:54.506 --> 41:57.774
Speaking of other things
I didn't mean to do...

41:57.876 --> 42:00.960
well, since apparently,
I'm stuck with you for a while,

42:01.713 --> 42:03.513
I figured you'd need a place to be.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.490
You're giving me an office?

42:13.592 --> 42:15.558
Clean it up, and it's all yours.

42:15.627 --> 42:18.762
Seriously? You want me
to move all your boxes?

42:18.864 --> 42:20.497
Good thing you have an assistant.
