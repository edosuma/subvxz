WEBVTT

00:21.166 --> 00:23.041
What do you have
there, Ned?

00:23.125 --> 00:25.041
It's for my dad.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.375
(Janet)
'Neddie!'

00:41.834 --> 00:43.208
Neddie, uh,
can
you take that

00:43.291 --> 00:45.291
bowl of potato chips
into the family room?

00:45.375 --> 00:47.291
'I've got batter
on my hands.'

00:47.375 --> 00:49.125
Mom, I drew a picture
of dad's plane

00:49.208 --> 00:51.375
with the exact way
that the wings are decorated.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.667
- 'Okay?'
- Okay, Neddie.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.792
Because you said he's not
flying in that anymore

00:54.875 --> 00:56.792
so he needs something
to remember it by.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.625
Mom, I need you to start
the shrimp rounds!

01:13.417 --> 01:14.709
Who are you?

01:16.083 --> 01:17.417
Who are you?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.125
I'm Ned.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.000
Well, then I'm your dad, Ned.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.750
You don't look
like my dad.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.458
I have his picture.

01:26.542 --> 01:30.083
Well, I'm a lot handsomer now
than I used to be.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.291
I'm home.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.208
Oh, my God..

01:38.834 --> 01:40.083
...Carl.

01:53.208 --> 01:55.333
Hi.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.667
- I remember you.
- Hi.

02:12.125 --> 02:13.375
I made this.

02:16.417 --> 02:18.333
It's for you.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.375
These are the bracelets
with your name on them.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.375
Everybody wore 'em
while you were in
Vietnam.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.834
Big boys don't cry, dad.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.542
I'm-I'm crying because your mom
spent so much money on this box.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.750
No, I made it.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.291
Oh, yeah?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.750
Lieutenant Stillman.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.500
Kat Miller,
narcotics.
I called you.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.166
Detective Rush and Valens.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.000
Glad you could
come down.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.959
We found something
interesting
tossing this place.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.000
(Rush)
'What are they?'

03:43.083 --> 03:44.834
POW bracelets.

03:44.917 --> 03:47.667
(Miller)
'All with the same name
on them. Carl Burton.'

03:47.750 --> 03:50.291
He was a navy pilot,
a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.166
He was shot to death
back here in '73.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.625
You remember that
off the cuff?

03:53.709 --> 03:54.917
He was a war hero.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.125
- Never brought the job in?
- Mm-mm.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.375
Where'd you find this?

03:58.458 --> 04:00.375
Behind the water
heater
in the cellar.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.458
I just thought that was
off.
Something sentimental

04:02.542 --> 04:04.750
to a murder victim
being stuffed down
there.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.750
So were these
like dog tags?

04:06.834 --> 04:09.000
Friends and family
wore them, not the
soldier.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.166
POWs that made
it home, like Carl did

04:11.250 --> 04:12.250
someone would
gather them up

04:12.333 --> 04:13.542
and make a
presentation to them.

04:13.625 --> 04:15.166
A-anyone you drag
out of this place

04:15.250 --> 04:16.417
know how they
wound up here?

04:16.500 --> 04:18.333
House was empty
when we hit it.

04:18.417 --> 04:19.875
Skimpy new direction.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.208
He's a POW, Scotty.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.166
We got anything,
we're going to go with
it.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.500
Oh yeah. Okay, sure.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.500
In fact, think of Carl
Burton
like family.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.792
That's how I want
this job worked.

05:11.959 --> 05:13.041
Carl Burton, 35.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.875
Lieutenant Commander,
US Navy.

05:14.959 --> 05:18.041
Shot down on his 23rd
bombing mission over Hanoi.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.458
Go up enough times,
luck runs out.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.125
No, his got even worse,
he was captured.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.000
Spent five years
in a prison camp.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.667
Survives all that, gets
gunned
down in his own area code.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.166
Seven months after he's home.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.583
Last place Carl's seen
was the funeral reception

05:30.667 --> 05:32.542
of a POW buddy of his,
Rex Potter.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.250
He was a Roxborough guy,
same as Carl.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.583
Didn't make it out
of the prison camp.

05:36.667 --> 05:37.875
(Valens)
'Interviews with the family'

05:37.959 --> 05:39.291
people at the
Potter house that night

05:39.375 --> 05:40.917
no one sees anything unusual.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.417
Carl's body was found
a mile from the reception

05:43.500 --> 05:44.875
gun was a few feet from him

05:44.959 --> 05:46.875
but rain washed
away any prints.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.917
Had a bag of marijuana
in his pocket.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.750
That funeral's got to be
intense, right?

05:52.834 --> 05:54.917
Putting Carl in the mood
for some kind of escape?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.667
(Jeffries)
'No, he scores,
gets shot on the way home.'

05:56.750 --> 05:58.375
Being in the
wrong neighborhood.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.917
Doesn't explain the
bracelets in that house.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.750
Maybe he tried to trade them
to the dealer.

06:01.834 --> 06:02.834
No, they're not
worth anything.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.458
Could be why he got shot.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.250
(Stillman)
'Now, let's talk
to Carl's wife and son.'

06:06.333 --> 06:08.959
See what they remember
about the day of the funeral.

06:09.041 --> 06:11.667
Could be another vet
burnout story, John.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.542
Lot of guys we served with
came home, turned to junk.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.542
Whatever we find,
we follow it up.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.125
You didn't have
to fix up, Mrs. Burton.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.750
Military wife.
Look right, live
right.

06:36.834 --> 06:38.875
- May I get you a drink?
- It's pretty early.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.583
Cocktail hour somewhere,
boys used to say.

06:44.917 --> 06:46.500
(Rush)
'We're here about
your husband's murder.'

06:46.583 --> 06:48.125
Something come up?

06:48.208 --> 06:52.583
We found his POW bracelets
in an abandoned house in Tioga.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.291
Kind of sketchy area
back when Carl was killed.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.792
'It's even worse now.'

06:59.500 --> 07:00.667
Okay.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.458
Any idea how the
bracelets wound up
there?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.208
No.

07:07.083 --> 07:11.083
This is embarrassing, but I
guess I lost track of them.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.959
You don't seem like the
losing-track type.

07:14.041 --> 07:17.667
No, but I lost track
of myself for a time
then.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.667
Carl was carrying pot
when he died.

07:19.750 --> 07:23.208
Theory was he...had a habit.
Got him into trouble that
night.

07:23.291 --> 07:26.291
Doesn't sound like the gung-ho
fighter pilot I married.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.667
How about the guy
who came home to you in '72?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.667
I don't think about that man.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.667
I'd rather remember Carl
as he was before.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.166
'He was strong.'

07:35.250 --> 07:37.834
He was a hero.
I was his wife.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.625
Would you have known
if he was doing drugs?

07:40.709 --> 07:43.667
No. We really tried.

07:45.083 --> 07:49.000
We just...never got
to know each other
again.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.041
This is very romantic.

08:09.125 --> 08:12.208
You turn into a champagne
girl while I was gone?

08:12.291 --> 08:15.542
[chuckles]
Come on now.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.834
After sleeping for years
with a guy in skivvies

08:28.917 --> 08:30.083
showered once a week.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.625
I'm finally looking good.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.875
Remember when
I broke up with you?

08:43.959 --> 08:47.333
You left a pathetic note
in my parents' mailbox.

08:47.417 --> 08:49.250
"I need to be free."

08:49.333 --> 08:51.250
You came up to me
in the parking lot.

08:51.333 --> 08:57.417
And I'm thinking, "Oh, no, here
better

08:57.500 --> 08:59.000
Remember?

08:59.083 --> 09:01.500
I knew better
than
you even then.

09:01.583 --> 09:05.000
"Carl, I got your note.
I don't think so."

09:06.583 --> 09:08.041
That's right.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.709
Mm.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.417
I feel 18.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.542
What is it?
Your shoulders?

09:32.625 --> 09:36.083
It's-it's okay. It's..
Come back.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.250
Honey, no,
not
if it hurts
you.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.500
Come on.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.500
We'll dance later
when you're
better.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.834
I don't want you to
pretend it doesn't
hurt.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.875
Let me pretend!

09:49.959 --> 09:53.166
My arms have been broken
four times! They're...busted!

09:53.250 --> 09:57.333
They'll always be.
I-I can't...lift them!

09:57.417 --> 09:59.000
I can't dance!

10:00.750 --> 10:03.000
I'm s..
I'm sorry.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.959
I should make sure
Ned didn't wake up.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.333
I'm going for a walk.

10:12.417 --> 10:15.000
You don't need to
wait for me.

10:27.166 --> 10:30.834
He'd go for walks...for hours.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.959
Is that when this started?

10:37.583 --> 10:39.959
Any idea where he'd
go
on these walks?

10:41.917 --> 10:45.041
I didn't know
where Carl was,
truly.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.917
Even when he was right
in front of me.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.542
But you two
stayed together.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.166
Hoping somehow
we'd find what we'd
lost.

10:52.792 --> 10:53.959
But before we could..

10:56.500 --> 10:57.875
...he was gone again.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.709
So, you're not the
kind
of doc sees
patients?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.542
No, I'm the kind
that does research.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.000
Better hours?

11:12.083 --> 11:13.917
Better company.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.417
So, where did
the bracelets turn up?

11:15.500 --> 11:18.125
Stashed away
in a crack
house.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.375
Were they in the box?

11:19.458 --> 11:22.792
- Yeah, there was a box.
- I made that thing.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.709
(Vera)
'Thinking is, your dad
wanted to buy drugs'

11:24.792 --> 11:26.917
maybe he got desperate
tried to pawn the bracelets.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.709
Not exactly what you want to
believe about your father,
but..

11:29.792 --> 11:31.375
We know you were young
when he got home.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.000
Seven.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.542
(Valens)
'You remember anything
that, looking back'

11:34.625 --> 11:36.583
makes you think
he was using?

11:36.667 --> 11:39.834
No. In fact, uh,
from the day he got back

11:39.917 --> 11:42.458
he never missed
triple nickel reveille.

11:42.542 --> 11:43.667
Waking up early?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.625
5:55 a.m.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.750
Exercised best he could.

11:47.834 --> 11:48.917
Started his day.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.792
It's not junkie behavior.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.458
When'd you last see
those bracelets?

11:52.542 --> 11:55.875
First week he was back, he,
uh,
put them in the basement.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.792
He wasn't...big on
war mementos.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.875
- Trying to move on.
- Yeah.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.333
Anyone around back then
who could've gotten

12:02.417 --> 12:03.834
in the way of that?

12:05.417 --> 12:07.333
There was someone..

12:07.417 --> 12:08.792
...who he shouldn't have
even known about.

12:14.667 --> 12:19.792
So these people, they made
me stay over in Vietnam.

12:19.875 --> 12:22.250
That why you didn't
write me any letters?

12:22.333 --> 12:23.959
Only way I could even
talk to my friends there

12:24.041 --> 12:26.250
was through a secret code
we made up.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.583
A secret code?

12:27.667 --> 12:29.458
Well, each letter had
its own number of taps.

12:29.542 --> 12:32.542
We'd spell out words
on the walls between our rooms.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.792
Wow. Like,
could
you do an N?

12:40.583 --> 12:42.166
Do E.

12:45.834 --> 12:46.750
D.

12:50.166 --> 12:53.917
That's my name, right?
That's Ned in our secret
code.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.417
Do another.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.667
Uh, I don't
know.
What's it mean?

13:04.750 --> 13:07.709
I said bear.
Want to go see the bears?

13:07.792 --> 13:12.166
When I come here with Ken, we
always go see the lions first.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.709
Who's Ken?

13:16.792 --> 13:19.041
Mommy's friend.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.834
What kind of friend?

13:20.917 --> 13:24.125
Well, he takes me to the zoo
and he takes mommy to dinner.

13:31.750 --> 13:35.583
At some level I...knew
I shouldn't have said
that.

13:35.667 --> 13:39.333
'Cause you knew this... Ken was
your mom's special friend?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.125
Guess I was a
little
messed up about

13:42.208 --> 13:44.709
the dueling
father
figures.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.875
Because truthfully,
I knew Ken a lot
better

13:46.959 --> 13:48.625
than my dad
at that
point.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.291
Your dad follow up
with this guy?

13:50.375 --> 13:52.959
Not that I heard about.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.291
If I spent five years
in a box getting tortured

13:55.375 --> 13:57.792
'while some guy's
taking my wife to dinner.'

13:57.875 --> 13:59.333
I'd follow up.

14:01.375 --> 14:02.917
Janet Burton didn't
mention anyone

14:03.000 --> 14:04.250
on the scene
while Carl was gone?

14:04.333 --> 14:06.333
Well, played the pained
and patient wife

14:06.417 --> 14:08.500
not big on airing
dirty laundry.

14:08.583 --> 14:09.959
Doesn't she want to
know
what happened to Carl?

14:10.041 --> 14:11.500
Seemed afraid of what
we might find

14:11.583 --> 14:14.166
him not turning out
to be the perfect hero.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.625
- The house with the
bracelets?
- Yeah, what'd you find?

14:16.709 --> 14:18.709
Back in '73, place
still had renters

14:18.792 --> 14:20.125
before crack
ran 'em out.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.959
One of 'em, Ken Westin.

14:23.041 --> 14:25.417
[scoffs]
Our perfect
wife's boyfriend.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.709
Step lively.
Quietly. Quietly.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.458
Giving you a heads-up,
Dorothy.

14:37.542 --> 14:40.458
Tour group's heading
to ceramics. Over.

14:40.542 --> 14:43.333
- Ken Westin?
- Absolutely.

14:43.417 --> 14:44.792
Detective Valens, homicide.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.333
Hey, mind if I ask
you
to step to this side

14:46.417 --> 14:48.750
of the rope here,
please?

14:48.834 --> 14:52.291
We found some POW bracelets
hidden in your old house, Ken.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.250
Belonged to a murder
victim, Carl Burton.

14:55.333 --> 14:59.291
Whoa. Carl's bracelets.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.291
I must have left
those
when I moved.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.000
Why were they in your house
in the first place?

15:04.542 --> 15:07.542
Already got the skinny on
your relationship with Janet

15:07.625 --> 15:09.500
so you can
pick up from there.

15:11.792 --> 15:16.959
I'm confessing to the act
of a heartsick young man. Okay?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.125
I took 'em..

15:19.375 --> 15:21.542
...the day
she broke up with
me.

15:21.625 --> 15:25.542
To make myself feel
better,
I snatched the bracelets.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.500
- Low, I know.
- It's real low, Ken.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.000
Guy was a POW.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.750
I appreciate that.

15:31.834 --> 15:33.166
I was over there, too.

15:33.250 --> 15:37.875
Eleven months before
illness befell me.

15:37.959 --> 15:41.667
So, let's say, the bracelet
snatch doesn't do the trick

15:41.750 --> 15:43.417
and you're still stewing.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.667
you
the night Carl gets shot.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.834
I was at Smokie's.

15:48.917 --> 15:52.041
My regular
night
spot. Sheesh!

15:52.125 --> 15:53.834
(Westin)
'I stole from the guy.'

15:53.917 --> 15:56.125
I did not wish
him
to be dead.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.917
Know anyone
who might have?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.083
I'll tell you
this,
when he came back

16:01.166 --> 16:04.583
Carl wasn't exactly winning
friends and influencing
people.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.125
What do you mean?

16:06.208 --> 16:07.333
Little unstable.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.875
And you'd know how?

16:08.959 --> 16:11.500
Did some research,
check up on the
guy.

16:11.583 --> 16:12.959
Make sure
he was worthy.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.375
I asked you
to take that down,
Wes.

16:22.458 --> 16:23.875
(Westin)
'You kiddin' me, hero?'

16:23.959 --> 16:25.709
Sign's worth at least
two cars a month.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.166
Be three if I could
teach you a little hustle.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.542
She's a beauty.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.709
Can I send you home
together today?

16:40.792 --> 16:43.583
Oh. Hello. I need
to think about it.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.000
Excuse me a minute.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.125
You can't keep
showing
up here, Daniel.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.583
- You gonna talk to me?
- No!

17:03.667 --> 17:06.542
- Well, you gotta someday.
- Kid's got hustle.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.208
Washing cars for free.
You know him?

17:08.291 --> 17:09.792
I told you
to beat it.

17:09.875 --> 17:12.417
Look, I just want
to know about my dad.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.500
Okay. I-I've asked you
three times.

17:13.583 --> 17:14.917
Now, I'm doing
your work for you.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.709
- I mean, what's it gonna
take--
- Leave this alone!

17:16.792 --> 17:19.000
father
- Believe me!

17:19.083 --> 17:21.083
There are some things
you don't want to
know.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.125
Now, get out of here!

17:28.458 --> 17:30.208
You know, I've been
real nice to you, Carl.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.834
You're gonna wish you
were nicer to me!

17:40.875 --> 17:44.375
So, who was
this
kid Daniel?

17:45.375 --> 17:46.959
I can't say for sure

17:47.041 --> 17:50.041
since I was no longer a member
of the inner circle.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.375
But this looked like
a personal thing to
you.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.500
Kid got under Carl's skin.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.875
And I'd done enough research.

17:56.959 --> 18:01.125
That was the last time I saw
the moody son of a gun.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.083
Ken Westin was a mistake.

18:05.166 --> 18:09.625
He was a neighborhood guy, kept
me company while Carl...was--

18:09.709 --> 18:12.417
Oh, he was pretty wounded
when you two broke up.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.500
Stole
Carl's
bracelets.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.709
Ken did?
Oh, for Pete's sake.

18:16.792 --> 18:19.417
Do you think he
would've
gone a step farther

18:19.500 --> 18:20.834
got into it with Carl?

18:20.917 --> 18:23.500
Confrontation
was not Ken's style.

18:23.583 --> 18:26.000
Janet, you know anything
about a kid named Daniel?

18:26.083 --> 18:27.291
Yeah.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.709
Daniel.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.208
He was..

18:33.458 --> 18:35.041
Would coffee help you?

18:35.125 --> 18:36.542
No.

18:37.959 --> 18:42.125
Daniel Potter, his father Rex
was a POW with Carl.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.667
(Janet)
'Didn't make it home.'

18:43.750 --> 18:47.375
It was Rex's memorial
Carl went to the day he
died.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.333
(Jeffries)
'You have any idea
why Carl and Daniel'

18:49.417 --> 18:51.834
were fighting
at the car dealership?

18:51.917 --> 18:53.625
Daniel was hounding Carl.

18:53.709 --> 18:56.542
Trying to get stuff
out of him about his father.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.375
But Carl wouldn't
talk about that.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.041
(Janet)
'He saw horrible things
in that prison camp.'

19:01.125 --> 19:05.291
He wouldn't revisit them
for anyone, not me, not
Daniel.

19:05.375 --> 19:06.917
When he said no to Daniel?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.917
Kid put a rock
through our window.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.041
He was angry at the world.

19:12.125 --> 19:15.792
But taking
it out on
Carl.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.458
(Valens)
their
when your dad was in prison?'

19:22.542 --> 19:23.917
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.166
Must have been rough..

19:26.417 --> 19:28.083
...never knowing
if he was comin' home.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.583
Well, I thought
it'd
be easier somehow

19:29.667 --> 19:32.041
if I knew the details
about what he was going
through.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.583
But Carl wouldn't say.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.166
He was trying to protect me.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.375
Pretty understanding
for a guy that threw a rock

19:38.458 --> 19:39.917
at Carl's house.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.792
Yeah, th-that was awful.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.250
You take it any further?

19:43.333 --> 19:45.583
Me being angry with
Carl,
stopped with the rock.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.250
Yeah? Why?

19:47.333 --> 19:49.542
He caught me red-handed.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.917
Finally gave me
what I wanted.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.333
- You're gonna pay to fix
that.
- Let go of me.

19:58.417 --> 20:03.083
No. You want to talk,
let's talk. Go ahead.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.417
- We're getting this over
with.
- Where's my dad?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.583
- Still in prison in Hanoi.
- Why? What'd he do?

20:07.667 --> 20:09.000
He's an American soldier.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.667
To the North
Vietnamese,
that's a crime.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.750
What's it like there,
the prison?

20:17.542 --> 20:20.000
There's not a lot to eat.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.291
Water makes you sick.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.583
Guards are monsters
in human clothes.

20:26.458 --> 20:30.333
But your dad and the other
guys,
they have each other.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.000
Can't they just get together
and break out of there?

20:32.083 --> 20:34.250
I mean, my dad can take
some Vietnamese guy.

20:37.458 --> 20:38.625
[whispers]
Maybe he
will.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.166
Is he gonna live?

20:42.250 --> 20:44.208
Yes.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.375
Your dad's one of the
strongest
people I've ever met.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.709
If I had
to trek into
Hell..

20:49.792 --> 20:51.667
...he's the guy
I'd want by my
side.

20:53.959 --> 20:55.667
He's coming home to you.

20:58.709 --> 21:00.250
[sighs]
You guys are brave.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.792
are,

21:05.333 --> 21:06.583
I knew it.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.500
Your dad..

21:10.583 --> 21:11.917
...he's a hero.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.583
Not me.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.583
I'm a coward.

21:21.458 --> 21:24.834
(Valens)
'Coward. Why would Carl
say that about himself?'

21:24.917 --> 21:27.000
Doesn't make sense, right?

21:27.083 --> 21:29.583
He survived five
years
of being tortured.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.625
Humble guy.

21:31.709 --> 21:33.291
Or troubled.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.542
You get the feeling
he really meant that, Daniel?

21:35.625 --> 21:38.041
Saw him a few times after
that,
talked to him about my dad

21:38.125 --> 21:41.125
but every time
I could always feel
it.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.583
Something was eatin' him up.

21:45.583 --> 21:46.875
Carl Burton's
military service record.

21:46.959 --> 21:48.083
I don't see
anything
in there

21:48.166 --> 21:49.750
make a guy call
himself
a coward.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.917
Awarded Bronze Star,
Purple Heart.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.667
Oh, this is it.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.959
- He took early release.
- What's that?

21:57.041 --> 21:58.250
Means he left
the prison camp
early.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.875
(Valens)
'I thought you couldn't
leave.'

21:59.959 --> 22:01.709
Well, not under honorable
circumstances, you couldn't.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.250
'The code of conduct
among POWs'

22:03.333 --> 22:05.417
is that the sickest
and longest serving go first.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.875
But Carl wasn't
either of those.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.917
Then how does he get
to the front of the
line?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.625
Tells the VC guards
what they want to
hear.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.166
Let's them use
him
for propaganda.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.875
That doesn't sound like
a gung-ho fighter pilot.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.667
- Why would he do that?
- Why?

22:16.750 --> 22:19.417
He's sick of getting beat
nearly
to death five years in a row.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.750
He misses his family,
he's stowed in solitary.

22:23.709 --> 22:24.875
It's hard to know
what a code like that

22:24.959 --> 22:26.500
starts to mean
at that point.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.625
- But a lot of guys did hang
in.
- Yeah, hundreds of 'em.

22:28.709 --> 22:30.458
And they would not
have been fans of Carl's.

22:30.542 --> 22:33.250
And they came home a week
before Carl was killed.

22:33.333 --> 22:37.250
End of March, '73,
main group of POWs got back.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.792
Any of 'em
come back to
Philly?

22:38.875 --> 22:40.959
Guy named Raitt
from Antioch.

22:41.041 --> 22:43.583
Roger Raitt,
a navy commander?

22:43.667 --> 22:44.834
You know him?

22:45.834 --> 22:47.291
I served with him.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.250
Been a long time.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.959
I'm not much for the reunions.

22:58.041 --> 23:00.041
[chuckles]
Truth be told,
I'm not either.

23:00.125 --> 23:03.250
But working
in the, uh, defense
industry

23:03.333 --> 23:04.417
it pays to keep in touch.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.625
I'm sure.

23:05.709 --> 23:07.667
There's one this
Saturday
in Old City.

23:07.750 --> 23:08.792
I can't make
small talk out of it.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.625
I'd rather just
leave it behind.

23:10.709 --> 23:13.834
And here you are
carrying a gun every
day.

23:13.917 --> 23:15.458
That's what
I couldn't
revisit.

23:17.792 --> 23:19.375
Roger, I want to talk
to you about a guy

23:19.458 --> 23:21.458
you were in prison with.
Carl Burton.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.375
'Wound up dead, shot..'

23:24.458 --> 23:25.834
...right after you guys
got back.

23:25.917 --> 23:27.250
I remember.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.333
Coming home,
it had to be hard to adjust.

23:29.417 --> 23:32.333
Well, it made me
realize
any day I wake up

23:32.417 --> 23:34.709
with a doorknob on
the inside of the
door

23:34.792 --> 23:36.166
it's a good day.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.291
Maybe someone else
didn't see it that way.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.166
Came back angry,
wanting to settle a score.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.166
Everyone has a breaking point.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.375
Carl reached his over there.

23:47.458 --> 23:51.375
I, um, I didn't
respect it,
but I understood.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.500
Hard to imagine
all the POWs did.

23:53.583 --> 23:54.959
We were like brothers, John.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.750
One of them went after Carl,
I would've known.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.208
We're talking
about a lot of soldiers

23:58.291 --> 23:59.959
and a guy they thought
was a traitor.

24:01.750 --> 24:05.750
We'd only been home a week,
and all of us already knew.

24:05.834 --> 24:09.125
Carl's worst punishment
was living with what he did.

24:13.667 --> 24:17.500
(Raitt)
'Rex's 51st bombing run,
he gets hit'

24:17.583 --> 24:21.041
ejects,
comes down outside Hanoi.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.083
He spends a few hours
hiding in a cave

24:23.166 --> 24:25.250
trying to get up
enough strength to move.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.083
'But when he hears
a North Vietnamese patrol'

24:27.166 --> 24:30.375
'he takes off
on a broken leg'

24:30.458 --> 24:34.375
'with only his pistol to
hold
off 20 guys chasing him.'

24:34.458 --> 24:38.375
'For hours, Rex dragged himself
along just ahead of them'

24:38.458 --> 24:40.959
'till he comes
to this hollowed-out tree'

24:41.041 --> 24:42.625
'and squeezes inside.'

24:42.709 --> 24:44.417
How dare you?

24:46.625 --> 24:47.917
I'm here to pay my respects.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
- How dare you sneak in here.
- Stop it!

24:50.083 --> 24:52.542
You don't know what this man
did to your father, Daniel.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.917
Let's calm down.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.917
We're here for Rex.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.709
Rex wouldn't want you here.

24:57.792 --> 25:00.583
You betrayed him,
betrayed everyone.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.500
You're a disgrace.

25:04.792 --> 25:06.542
Daddy?

25:06.625 --> 25:08.583
Okay, Ned.

25:11.709 --> 25:13.375
I'm sorry, Ruth.

25:18.208 --> 25:20.417
Carl.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.291
I think it's better if you
don't go to the reception.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.041
- Yeah.
- I'll tell the guys
that--

25:25.125 --> 25:26.709
Tell them I died
over there, Roger.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.750
Tell them I'm already a ghost.

25:38.291 --> 25:41.417
Guys who stuck it out,
resisted the most.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.917
Did better when we got home.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.542
Ones who gave in
had a tougher time.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.875
Uh-huh.

25:45.959 --> 25:47.959
How bad do you
think it was for Carl?

25:48.041 --> 25:50.750
Bad enough.
I thought he'd kill
himself.

25:50.834 --> 25:53.458
The gun was found five feet
away from his body.

25:53.542 --> 25:57.125
You remember how long it takes
a man to die from a gun shot?

25:57.208 --> 25:59.709
'Might have crawled
a ways after.'

25:59.792 --> 26:00.959
But who commits suicide

26:01.041 --> 26:03.834
by shooting themselves
in the stomach?

26:03.917 --> 26:08.291
Guy aiming for his heart
whose arms don't work anymore.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.125
Could be my last
cheesesteak for awhile.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.333
Oh, yeah?

26:21.583 --> 26:23.500
Julie's talking about tofu.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.709
(Miller)
'Lieutenant.'

26:24.792 --> 26:25.959
Miller.
How you doing?

26:26.041 --> 26:27.542
Just dropped a
guy
in lockup.

26:27.625 --> 26:29.041
How's the Burton
case panning out?

26:29.125 --> 26:30.750
Uh, Nick Vera,
this is Kat Miller.

26:30.834 --> 26:33.333
She's the one that turned up
the POW bracelets.

26:33.417 --> 26:36.500
- Good work.
- Thanks. So?

26:36.583 --> 26:39.709
Well, the latest is Carl
might have committed suicide.

26:39.792 --> 26:43.291
A close fire would've left lead
residue on his clothes, right?

26:43.375 --> 26:45.166
Lab's checking.

26:45.250 --> 26:47.875
So, I hear you're doing well
over in Narcotics.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.166
Oh.
Good.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.125
I like it, so..

26:52.208 --> 26:54.333
That your long-term
area of interest?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.834
I never thought I'd be a
cop
in the first place

26:57.917 --> 27:00.542
so I'm game
for whatever crops
up.

27:00.625 --> 27:03.166
I thought being in blue
was every girl's dream.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.792
You got something else in mind?

27:04.875 --> 27:06.375
It's a long story.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.959
But, here I am.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.208
My options are open.

27:09.291 --> 27:10.542
That's good to know.

27:17.458 --> 27:21.291
Ken Westin copped to takin'
your dad's bracelets.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.542
Ken did?
Really?

27:23.625 --> 27:26.375
A dumb reaction to
your mom dropping him.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.166
That maybe make the, uh,
drug scenario less
likely?

27:29.250 --> 27:30.542
Maybe.

27:30.625 --> 27:33.792
Ned, there was an incident
at Rex Potter's memorial.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.208
(Valens)
'Day your father died.'

27:35.291 --> 27:37.000
Yeah, I remember it.

27:37.083 --> 27:40.375
The rest of the POWs took
issue with your dad showing
up.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.542
You could see it in their
faces
when we walked in.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.875
They hated him.

27:43.959 --> 27:46.417
Must've been
pretty
crushing for him.

27:46.500 --> 27:51.000
One of those POWs thinks, maybe
he couldn't take it any longer.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.166
You mean killed himself?

27:56.959 --> 27:58.583
(Valens)
'However he died, Ned'

27:58.667 --> 28:00.917
it ain't gonna
change
what he was to you.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.333
I know a reason why
he might've killed
himself.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.333
Me.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.583
What I did.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.208
Hey, buddy.

28:26.291 --> 28:30.041
I know it's not fun to be
around
people yelling like that.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.667
It's okay.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.458
I love you.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.041
Me too, daddy.

28:39.375 --> 28:43.000
So you don't mind if I eat
all your ice cream?

28:43.083 --> 28:45.709
You could have your own.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.333
So, what can I
get you guys?

28:48.417 --> 28:49.709
Bomb Pop, please.

28:51.333 --> 28:54.875
Hey, I remember you. You came in
last summer with your dad.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.834
I'm his dad.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.583
Carl Burton. Hi.

28:58.667 --> 29:02.959
No, it was another man,
a soldier.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.625
He'd been over in
a Vietnam prison camp.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.583
Had some break-your-heart
stories about it.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.583
I-I was not here last
summer.
I was..

29:09.750 --> 29:11.333
That was not me.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.250
I'm sure it was this
little boy with..

29:14.333 --> 29:15.792
Who was that?

29:17.667 --> 29:19.667
Who was it, Ned?

29:22.250 --> 29:24.542
Ken.

29:24.625 --> 29:25.750
Ken was..

29:27.083 --> 29:28.417
...not a POW.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.041
He used my name?

29:31.917 --> 29:34.834
Told this lady
he was your dad?

29:34.917 --> 29:36.625
Yes.

29:38.417 --> 29:41.000
And you let him?

29:41.083 --> 29:42.542
Why, Ned?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.000
I don't know.

29:52.458 --> 29:56.709
(Valens)
'So Ken's not just moving in
on
Carl's wife while he's gone'

29:56.792 --> 29:58.375
he's pretending to be him.

29:58.458 --> 30:01.250
I was with him a few times
when he did it.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.542
Didn't stop him.

30:02.625 --> 30:03.709
You were seven.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.208
But I knew it was wrong.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.834
So after your dad found out?

30:07.917 --> 30:11.083
Marched me home, went down
to the basement for awhile.

30:11.166 --> 30:12.083
Then left.

30:12.166 --> 30:13.667
Where was your mom?

30:13.750 --> 30:15.291
Asleep.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.792
Has been ever since.

30:18.834 --> 30:20.542
Lab results are back.

30:20.625 --> 30:24.417
No traces of lead on Carl's
clothes that rules out
suicide.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.792
So even if that's what
Carl was thinking that night

30:26.875 --> 30:28.125
someone got to him first.

30:28.208 --> 30:29.667
(Valens)
'Look, if it's me'

30:29.750 --> 30:31.875
I'm heading after the
guy
posing as my kid's dad.

30:31.959 --> 30:36.166
It says here, Carl was at
Rex Potter's funeral
reception.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.667
Even after Roger Raitt
told him not to show.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.709
Ken lived near the Potters,
knew them.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.667
(Valens)
'So maybe he's at
the reception.'

30:42.750 --> 30:44.375
That's where Carl
goes looking for
him.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.083
So after Carl gets something
out of the basement

30:46.166 --> 30:49.083
maybe a weapon,
he goes to confront Ken.

30:49.166 --> 30:51.041
And never makes it back.

30:54.583 --> 30:56.458
Westin spent four months
in Texas in '71

30:56.542 --> 30:58.083
waiting to be shipped out.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.792
Had a nervous breakdown.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.375
Discharged before
he left US soil.

31:02.458 --> 31:03.667
Alright.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.750
You want us in there?

31:05.834 --> 31:06.959
I got it.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.792
(Stillman)
'Sorry to pull you
from work, Ken.'

31:15.250 --> 31:17.291
I needed to talk to you.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.166
Oh, sure.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.542
So, it sounds
like
Carl Burton

31:21.625 --> 31:24.375
was coming apart at
the seams when he got
back.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.291
He seemed to have trouble
adjusting.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.291
It's tough to watch that.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.667
Guys over there
snapping out.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.542
"Got to go home,
get out of here."

31:34.625 --> 31:36.417
You can see they're
never
gonna be the same.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.625
- You-you know what I mean.
- Oh, I do.

31:38.709 --> 31:41.959
Everybody going,
"Crap, so-and-so lost it."

31:42.041 --> 31:43.792
But back of your mind,
you're thinking

31:43.875 --> 31:46.000
"I'm with him."

31:46.083 --> 31:48.125
In your weak moments.

31:48.208 --> 31:50.083
You lay scheming at night.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.834
Come close to doing
some crazy stuff.

31:52.917 --> 31:55.166
[chuckles]
Yeah.

31:55.250 --> 31:59.417
So Carl turns up at this funeral
reception where he's disinvited.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.625
- Wha-what's he like?
- Antagonistic.

32:02.792 --> 32:04.333
He's looking for trouble.

32:05.417 --> 32:07.875
So you saw him
the night he
died.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.709
That's funny,
'cause
you didn't tell us
that.

32:09.792 --> 32:13.083
You said you were at
the bar tossin' back a
few

32:13.166 --> 32:14.667
when Carl was shot.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.000
Yep.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.792
Went there after.

32:21.875 --> 32:22.834
Okay.

32:22.917 --> 32:24.250
So that was a
lie
you told us.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.834
Not intentionally.

32:27.917 --> 32:29.333
Been a long time.

32:29.417 --> 32:31.250
Memory's middle-aged now.

32:31.333 --> 32:34.333
[laughs]
That's okay. That's okay.

32:34.417 --> 32:36.500
That's a small
time
lie for you.

32:47.625 --> 32:49.250
Does that bother you, Ken?

32:50.792 --> 32:53.083
'Cause it doesn't seem
violent
to me. I'm used to it.

32:55.125 --> 32:59.208
Maybe because guns have been
part of me since I was a kid.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.125
I was 17 years old
when I went over
there.

33:03.166 --> 33:04.417
I thought it was a toy..

33:06.208 --> 33:09.041
...until I watched
a human die slowly.

33:11.083 --> 33:12.792
Well, you know what
I'm talking about.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.250
What this does.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.625
Not 'cause you were
a solder, because..

33:24.709 --> 33:26.542
'...we know you weren't.'

33:27.750 --> 33:28.750
Uh..

33:28.834 --> 33:30.792
[clears throat]
...lieutenant.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.083
How long did Carl bleed?

33:39.166 --> 33:40.375
This is serious!

33:42.041 --> 33:43.792
How long did Carl bleed?

33:48.083 --> 33:49.500
I could never.

33:51.875 --> 33:55.208
Extreme circumstances,
you learn about human nature.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.125
But what kind of person
would pretend to be a POW?

34:04.750 --> 34:06.125
I'd like a lawyer.

34:06.208 --> 34:09.208
- Why? What did you do?
- I didn't do anything to
Carl.

34:09.291 --> 34:10.542
No, you took what
belonged to him

34:10.625 --> 34:13.458
and you walked around
like it was yours.

34:13.542 --> 34:16.500
Do you really think someone
who had a nervous breakdown

34:16.583 --> 34:20.458
at Fort Hood would survive
five years in the Hanoi
Hilton?

34:23.417 --> 34:25.417
It was a bad lie you told.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.542
I know.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.125
I think I may have a disease.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.834
You tell people you're a race
car driver, a brain surgeon.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.041
Not a POW.

34:44.834 --> 34:47.125
Now, talk about that night.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.500
Carl confronted you
at that reception.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.458
- Yes.
- Then what did you do?

34:53.792 --> 34:55.792
Nothing.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.583
Got called out.

35:03.458 --> 35:05.875
See, I didn't have much time.
After I parachuted down

35:05.959 --> 35:09.500
I had to start my escape
on a busted leg.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.000
- Some going--
- I hear you want to be me.

35:12.083 --> 35:14.625
- Excuse me?
- Might as well take these.

35:14.709 --> 35:17.583
You use my name,
my wife, my kid.

35:17.667 --> 35:19.291
So now you got everything
that means a damn thing to me.

35:19.375 --> 35:22.625
Carl, this is awkward.

35:22.709 --> 35:24.834
You got something wrong
with you, you know that?

35:27.917 --> 35:31.166
Oh, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.208
You're a fraud.

35:32.291 --> 35:33.291
Daniel, I'm sorry.

35:33.375 --> 35:35.250
Hey, Carl,
let's play a game.

35:37.875 --> 35:41.041
This is a grenade,
and you're you.

35:44.834 --> 35:45.709
Daniel.

35:45.792 --> 35:47.667
Get away from me!

36:05.458 --> 36:07.208
And that's how you
got the bracelets.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.083
A few minutes later..

36:11.166 --> 36:15.417
...Daniel left the house,
went after Carl.

36:18.291 --> 36:21.000
I told your detective
the kid was a problem.

36:22.125 --> 36:23.542
Yeah, well.

36:23.625 --> 36:25.959
You're a real solid
judge of character,
Ken.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.417
You found out the truth
that day, huh, Daniel?

36:40.500 --> 36:41.667
What truth?

36:41.750 --> 36:44.417
- About Carl.
- He wasn't the guy you
thought.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.709
He was, underneath.

36:47.417 --> 36:49.583
Hearing about early release
didn't change that.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.458
So why the big scene
at the reception?

36:51.542 --> 36:53.959
You were real keyed up,
giving Carl a what for.

36:54.041 --> 36:55.208
Called him a fraud.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.959
Look, Vietnam was complicated.

36:58.041 --> 37:00.375
The POWs are getting tortured
and all they hear from America

37:00.458 --> 37:03.291
is-is th-that
this war's a
mistake.

37:03.375 --> 37:06.333
I get it. I get
Carl
throwing in the
towel.

37:06.417 --> 37:09.750
See, that interesting, but
that's what an adult thinks.

37:09.834 --> 37:12.458
What's a 15-year-old who just
lost his dad think?

37:12.542 --> 37:15.041
That Carl abandoned
Rex Potter to die.

37:15.125 --> 37:16.709
(Valens)
'And he runs home with his
tail
between his legs'

37:16.792 --> 37:18.333
'while your dad's
still taking it.'

37:18.417 --> 37:21.792
- Busted limbs, broken tee--
- Don't talk about my dad!

37:25.709 --> 37:27.750
You don't know what
it was like for him.

37:29.959 --> 37:31.583
But Carl did.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.041
And he still left him there.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.500
I got one letter from my dad

37:36.583 --> 37:39.166
but the government
blacked it out half way.

37:39.250 --> 37:42.291
He took the time to write me
and they blacked it out.

37:44.792 --> 37:46.625
I thought I could
get the black off.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.166
I put it in water.

37:53.583 --> 37:55.417
The only letter he sent.

37:59.834 --> 38:01.792
I just wanted to know him.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.750
He was gone a long time.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.875
I thought that Carl
could help me.

38:10.959 --> 38:12.208
Fill in the gaps.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.875
And he was right.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.417
I didn't want to know.

38:40.291 --> 38:42.125
Do you want to just follow
me
or do you want to talk?

38:42.208 --> 38:43.792
I wanna ask you some things.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.000
Are you stoned?

38:50.875 --> 38:52.542
Do not get into this.

38:52.625 --> 38:55.375
- This is bad news.
- Shut up!

38:55.458 --> 38:56.583
This time we're talking

38:56.667 --> 38:59.166
and you're gonna
answer me for real.

38:59.250 --> 39:03.250
After you left today, the other
POWs told me that you gave up.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.709
Said things you
should be ashamed of

39:04.792 --> 39:06.875
then left my dad to die.
Is that true?

39:13.333 --> 39:15.125
Is it true, Carl?

39:18.208 --> 39:22.542
I left the prison.
And your dad was
still--

39:22.625 --> 39:24.208
You left him!
All his friends said it!

39:24.291 --> 39:27.000
I didn't want anything
to happen to him.

39:27.083 --> 39:29.417
But I had to go home.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
They played you on a loudspeaker
in the prison

39:31.583 --> 39:33.959
and everyone heard you say
that the war was wrong.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.083
You said
they were war criminals

39:35.166 --> 39:36.750
and that
the Vietnamese saved you!

39:36.834 --> 39:39.291
I said things I didn't mean
because I wanted to get
home.

39:39.375 --> 39:41.542
Why? Why couldn't you
do like my dad?

39:41.625 --> 39:43.625
Because they broke me!

39:43.709 --> 39:47.333
They chained us up
and kicked our teeth
in

39:47.417 --> 39:50.750
and killed our friends
because that's what they did.

39:54.583 --> 39:56.375
To my dad?

39:56.458 --> 39:57.625
'To all of us.'

39:59.000 --> 40:01.333
And I couldn't do it
one more day.

40:01.417 --> 40:04.083
I wanted to see my wife
and my son.

40:07.125 --> 40:09.333
You're saying my dad
didn't want to see me?

40:09.417 --> 40:11.500
- Hey, Daniel, put that down.
- Answer me!

40:11.583 --> 40:13.000
Your dad was crazy about you.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.625
Why didn't he come home then?

40:14.709 --> 40:16.917
'Because he wouldn't give in.'

40:17.000 --> 40:19.250
He was the toughest guy
I ever met.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.750
'He-he could stick it out
and I couldn't.'

40:23.792 --> 40:28.291
[crying]
What if they were breaking
his arms and kicking his
teeth

40:28.375 --> 40:30.417
while he heard you saying that
stuff over the loudspeaker?

40:30.500 --> 40:32.667
- Daniel!
- He heard you say he was
wrong.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.667
And he wasn't! He wasn't!

40:41.875 --> 40:45.750
Oh, God.
Carl, I-I think I hit you bad.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.709
Go. Don't be
here.
Go. It's okay.

40:51.792 --> 40:53.500
Carl, I didn't mean it.

40:53.583 --> 40:56.375
Go! Run!
Run.
