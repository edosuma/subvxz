WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.639
- Happy?
- Yeah.

00:04.640 --> 00:05.680
Me too.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.679
I've never felt
this way about anyone.

00:09.680 --> 00:14.359
I know we've not known each other
that long, but I know that

00:14.360 --> 00:16.199
this feels right.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.040
And I... This might sound crazy.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.440
But what would you say to us
moving in together?

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.520 --> 01:20.039
- It's not like you're getting any younger.
- Give it a rest, Mum.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.599
- You got plans this weekend?
- You trying to get shot of me?

01:22.600 --> 01:26.159
- I'm just saying - it's time you went to
bed with something other than work. - Mum!

01:26.160 --> 01:28.479
Well, last night, you feel asleep
with the light on. Again.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.079
With your glasses on. Again.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.439
With work papers falling
out of your hand.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.479
Morning.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.719
Oh, you tell her, Davey.
She won't listen to her mother.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.479
What, and you think she'd
listen to me?

01:37.480 --> 01:39.719
You're not here this early to
gang up on me.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.199
No. No, I wish.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.439
A body's been found near
Baillie's Causeway.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.479
OK, give me five minutes.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.359
Honestly, Davey.
Tell her to give herself a shake.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.599
Get a life.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.720
I heard that.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.839
No ID on him.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.439
Pathologist reckons he's been
there for several hours.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.639
If you look at his clothes,
they're wet.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.839
It was raining last night, but they
think it stopped about 1am, apparently.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.439
So he's been here all night?
Yeah.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.319
We think he lost control of
the car, swerved off the road.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.719
Probably drunk driving.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.040
Got out and was hit by
a passing vehicle.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.199
Hit and run?

02:34.200 --> 02:38.720
Looks that way. No CCTV
this far out of town, though.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.519
Excuse me.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.599
Hello... Yeah, go on, let's have it.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.760
..All right, OK. Good work.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.000
We've got an ID from
the registration number.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.400
Jason Daniels.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.160
"JD is king".

03:00.440 --> 03:01.600
Poor old JD.

03:04.880 --> 03:10.039
Are you sure this is all right, Mrs Daniels?
He has sustained some serious facial injuries.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.280
I need to see him.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.200
Is this your husband,
Jason Daniels?

03:23.480 --> 03:26.639
No. No, no, it's not him.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.999
It's the shock.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.119
Sorry. Sorry, I, er...

03:30.120 --> 03:32.199
It's fine. Take as long as you need.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.879
Do you know who this man is?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.879
No. No, can you cover him up?

03:36.880 --> 03:38.479
Are you sure?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.999
Yes, quite sure.
Can you cover him up now, please?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.479
I'm very sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.879
No. I... I need to go.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.919
I-I want to talk to my husband.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.559
So do we.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.000
Davey...

03:54.640 --> 03:58.400
Yes. Sorry, Mrs Daniels. If you'd
like to follow me out. Thank you.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.999
I knew I'd find you in here.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.800
Yeah. I'll be there in a minute.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.080
Whoa.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.959
Have you seen this?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.439
What?

04:16.440 --> 04:19.879
Well, I've heard of blowing your
own trumpet, but even still.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.159
Seriously, Clint,
can you show some respect?

04:22.160 --> 04:23.600
No, look.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.480
"Paradise awaits".

04:35.400 --> 04:37.199
OK. We're back to square one.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.039
So I'm going to need you to get me
everything you can on Jason Daniels.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.959
Where he went to school,
how he made his money.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.479
Did he owe money?
Did he have a driver?

04:44.480 --> 04:46.319
Anything. OK?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.719
Have the forensic guys finished?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.839
Yeah, all secured, Sarge.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.880
All right.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.759
We've traced it to a Fred Clegg.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.639
And we found "Dad"
in his list of contacts

05:25.640 --> 05:27.519
so his folks are on the way in now.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.959
Can you do me a favour?

05:28.960 --> 05:31.399
Can you speak to them for me,
please?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.439
Yeah, of course.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.919
Thanks. I've got Jason Daniels
coming in for interview.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.679
Who is this "A" person?

05:37.680 --> 05:39.639
"CAN'T W8 2 C U AGAIN".

05:39.640 --> 05:41.959
Well, it's his girlfriend,
by the looks of it.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.719
What makes you so sure it's a woman?

05:43.720 --> 05:45.320
Judging by the picture she sent.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.519
Oh, yeah, that would clinch it.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.119
Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
And there's the text messages.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.639
"Can't stop thinking about you."

05:52.640 --> 05:54.919
"Can't wait to see you again."
Really lovey-dovey.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.719
Up until last night and then it's...

05:56.720 --> 05:59.319
"Sorry about what I said."
"I didn't mean to push you away."

05:59.320 --> 06:01.439
"Please can we go back to
the way we were?"

06:01.440 --> 06:02.719
She's got it bad, hasn't she?

06:02.720 --> 06:03.799
Have you spoken to her?

06:03.800 --> 06:04.879
No, not yet.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.359
I want to get a positive ID from
his parents first.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.479
Yeah?

06:08.480 --> 06:09.719
Jason Daniels.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.959
Ah, right. Thank you.
Mr Daniels. DS Higgins.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.119
My colleague, Jane Kennedy,
the coroner.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.440
Pleased to meet you.
I'll leave you to it.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.720
Yeah. Have a seat.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.200
Right. I won't beat around the bush.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.079
Do you know this man?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.679
Is that the guy that stole my car?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.679
Are you saying your car was stolen?

06:31.680 --> 06:35.039
While I was away, obviously.
Is there any damage?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.039
No. It's just a slight bump.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.959
That's a relief.
When can I get it back?

06:39.960 --> 06:41.639
A day or two, I should think.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.159
So, the man in the photo.
You don't know him, no?

06:44.160 --> 06:45.439
No.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.799
Right, OK.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.919
Look, I'm very sorry about
the mix-up this morning.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.719
Your wife tried to call you.
So did we.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.199
But we just got the answerphone.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.679
Have you any idea what you put her
through this morning?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.679
Ah, well, like I said,
I'm very sorry.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.239
We just have to go with the
information that's in front of us.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.719
Yeah, I appreciate that, Sergeant.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.360
So I won't be taking it
any further - for the moment.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.320
Terrible business.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.079
He might've been a thief, but to leave him
at the side of the road, like a dog...

07:14.080 --> 07:16.919
If there's anything I can do
to help with your enquiries?

07:16.920 --> 07:20.119
Ah, yeah, actually. It would be
handy to get your fingerprints.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.839
Just for the purposes of
elimination.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.199
Should take about ten minutes.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.519
Of course.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.800
And if you need anything else,
you can get me in the office.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.959
Ah, right. OK, great, thanks.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.680
OK, I'll show you the way.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.919
I'll let you know as soon
as we have any information.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.960
Take care.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.239
Thanks, Sheila.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.559
Hey.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.639
That his folks?

07:45.640 --> 07:48.039
Yes. We've got a positive ID.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.480
Everyone knew him as Fred, but
to his mum, he was always Freddy.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.200
PM results.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.720
Right, shall we?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.879
"Examination of the scalp shows
evidence of bruising."

08:03.880 --> 08:08.079
"Scalp lacerations with comminuted,
depressed skull fractures."

08:08.080 --> 08:10.359
"Extradural and subdural
bleeding..."

08:10.360 --> 08:11.480
I can read, Davey.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.680
"Not compatible with a pedestrian
road traffic collision."

08:23.920 --> 08:26.439
We've got blood where his head was
banged on the door.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.639
There are two sets of prints
all over the car.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.679
But there's a third set on the
driver's side door handle there,

08:31.680 --> 08:32.919
and on the seat there.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.440
And if you come round here...

08:35.919 --> 08:39.640
..we've got some scratches there.
Traces of black paint.

08:40.679 --> 08:41.958
So...?

08:41.960 --> 08:44.559
We think he was run off the road,
dragged from the car, beaten up.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.439
And left for dead.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.639
Yeah, well, we know that
he lay there for several hours.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.799
So, it's either a murder or
a serious assault gone wrong.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.320
Or it wasn't meant for him?

08:54.360 --> 08:55.560
Yeah. Well...

08:56.560 --> 08:59.919
..that number plate does
rather scream, "Here I am."

08:59.920 --> 09:01.519
"Come and get me," doesn't it?

09:01.520 --> 09:05.159
So... Fred steals
a car for whatever reason.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.119
Takes a hit for Jason Daniels.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.559
Yeah. Either way, a serious crime.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.079
So, what's next?

09:11.080 --> 09:13.599
Well, I'm going to go to
Fred Clegg's flat.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.119
Then I've gotta see this "A" woman.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.679
Give her the bad news.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.759
OK. I'll see you later, then.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.999
Hang on.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.880
- What?
- Well, are you... busy just now?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.239
Why?

09:25.240 --> 09:28.159
Oh, come on.
You know this is the bit I hate.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.639
Breaking bad news?
Or asking me for help?

09:30.640 --> 09:32.999
Both. And you're much
better at it than I am.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.599
- Is that a please?
- Is that a yes?

09:34.600 --> 09:35.640
Yes, go on, then.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.359
Oh, wow! "J Daniels Developments"?

09:40.360 --> 09:44.839
Yeah, he's converting an old church
into 40 new harbourside flats.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.999
And he owns a nightclub, too.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.479
The Lighthouse, you know it?

09:48.480 --> 09:49.719
No.

09:49.720 --> 09:53.240
He's Mr Big Shot, you know.
A player.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.240
I don't know any Fred Clegg.
What's this about?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.799
Do you know this man?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.359
That's Jeremy.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.679
Jeremy?

10:15.680 --> 10:18.040
Jeremy Dutton.
Why do you want to know?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.679
No... He can't be. No!

10:29.680 --> 10:31.919
- What's going on?
- Oh, Steve!

10:31.920 --> 10:32.999
Hey, it's all right.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.719
Jeremy. He's dead!

10:34.720 --> 10:36.839
What? Dead?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.479
Oh, yeah, sorry.
DS Higgins, South Dart Police.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.439
This is my colleague, Jane Kennedy.
She's the coroner.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.719
You're?

10:43.720 --> 10:44.879
Steve Johnson.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.079
My ex.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.839
Look, I understand
this is very difficult,

10:47.840 --> 10:49.999
but we really need you to tell us

10:50.000 --> 10:52.239
everything you know about, er,
Jeremy?

10:52.240 --> 10:55.239
He was an airline pilot.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.839
Er, no, actually.
He was a window cleaner.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.959
What?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.999
And his name wasn't Jeremy.
It was Fred. Fred Clegg.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.719
How did you meet him?

11:03.720 --> 11:07.160
On a dating site - Perfect Pair.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.559
Look, there must be some mistake.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.439
He was loaded. That car of his,

11:13.440 --> 11:16.239
I mean, the starting price
is 70 grand.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.439
Well, we have reason to believe
that he stole it.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.559
When?

11:19.560 --> 11:20.759
Last night.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.639
No, you're wrong. It's his car.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.320
He's always got it.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.999
He can't be a window cleaner.
He can't be.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.119
Can you think of anyone who would
want to hurt him?

11:32.120 --> 11:33.679
Look, she hardly knew the guy.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.360
Excuse me,
but how did you hurt your hand?

11:38.560 --> 11:41.359
Comes with the job. I'm a bouncer.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.759
Where?

11:42.760 --> 11:43.959
Pubs, mostly.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.039
I can't believe he's dead.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.079
Look, she's upset. You better leave.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.399
Yeah, sorry.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.759
Yeah, but you were one of the last
people to see him alive.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.839
So we will want to talk to you
again. All right.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.040
We'll be in touch.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.399
- Wow.
- Ooh. Classy.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.799
Yeah, looks like he's going for
the old sexy bachelor pad vibe.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.159
What?

12:21.160 --> 12:23.519
I don't think anyone says
"pad" any more.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.679
Don't they?

12:24.680 --> 12:25.720
No!

12:29.600 --> 12:31.639
Come and have a look at this!

12:31.640 --> 12:34.119
This room looks like
it's seen some action.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.039
- Or don't we say "action" anymore?
- How would I know?

12:38.040 --> 12:40.520
- He's certainly got a one-track mind.
- Yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.799
Looks like he broke the bed.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.080
What are you doing?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.079
Hello, Yes?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.240
..No, it's all right, go on.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.839
Really?

13:07.840 --> 13:11.399
..No, OK, good.
Good work. OK, bye.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.440
Bye.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.240
We've got it. The connection between
Fred Clegg and Jason Daniels.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.040
Sergeant.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.239
I asked you specifically
to come and see me in the office.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.839
Surely this can wait till tomorrow?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.839
I'm afraid it can't, no.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.640
I'm sorry about this, darling.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.319
OK, I'm back. Where were we?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.879
Sorry, Mrs Daniels, could you stay?

14:04.880 --> 14:06.799
You need to hear this.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.520
I'll call you back in ten minutes.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.239
We now know that Fred Clegg's
death wasn't caused

14:13.240 --> 14:15.719
by a hit and run,
but by a vicious attack.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.079
That's awful.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.119
Yeah.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.079
But what we don't know is if that
attack was meant for him or for you.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.399
What?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.199
So, can you think of anyone who
might want to harm you?

14:25.200 --> 14:28.399
Well, you don't get to be this
successful without making a few enemies.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.119
What do you mean "enemies"?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.559
You know, business rivals,
resentful losers,

14:32.560 --> 14:33.799
that kind of thing.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.359
Look, if the attack
was meant for you,

14:35.360 --> 14:36.679
then you might still be at risk.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.359
That's what you've come to say,
isn't it?

14:38.360 --> 14:41.040
So you need to be extra careful.
Promise me.

14:43.680 --> 14:47.359
I'm sorry,
I really need to take this.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.480
She's a very busy woman, my wife.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.720
She's a fund manager, you know.
One of the best.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.639
Er, could you do me a favour?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.800
Would you mind looking at
this photo again, please?

15:04.360 --> 15:11.360
Actually. I wonder... Could be the
window cleaner at my offices. Is it?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.959
- It is, yeah.
- That's it.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.199
He cleaned the windows
inside and out.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.360
Actually, he's been in my office.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.959
He could've taken my car keys,
stolen my car.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.239
Well, that car was used on
several occasions.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.159
Are you saying
he stole it repeatedly?

15:29.160 --> 15:32.039
- He must've done.
- I find that hard to believe.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.599
I know. It's outrageous.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.319
But now I come to think of it, I lost
a set of car keys a few months ago.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.959
He must've nicked them and taken
the car whenever he liked.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.039
You must have a high level of
security there, though.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.919
Yeah, but I'm out and about all day
and I'm often away on business.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.039
I leave it all over the place.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.879
I find that very hard to believe.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.200
It's just a car.
I'm not precious about it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.399
"It's just a car.
I'm not precious about it."

16:02.400 --> 16:03.679
I mean, how crass is that?

16:03.680 --> 16:05.679
I don't think his wife would
disagree with you.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.959
- What do you mean?
- You didn't see the way she looked at him?

16:07.960 --> 16:10.159
No, but I saw her reaction when
she saw the body.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.399
She was pretty shaken.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.119
Could be because it wasn't him.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.799
I think she's worth checking out.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.679
Oh, right, so you think she's hired a hitman and
he's got the wrong guy because of the stolen car.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.759
Pretty rubbish hitman.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.759
I've got a feeling about her.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.320
Wrong tree, love.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.839
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

16:33.840 --> 16:35.279
I believe this is your car?

16:35.280 --> 16:36.799
What if it is?

16:36.800 --> 16:39.279
How did you get that dent
on the side?

16:39.280 --> 16:42.279
Some woman ran into me. Why?

16:42.280 --> 16:43.519
What's this about?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.439
Where were you on Sunday night?

16:45.440 --> 16:47.359
Last Sunday? At my mum's.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.959
Putting up her curtains.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.959
Oh, that's nice. Till when?

16:50.960 --> 16:53.199
Early hours. Four. Five.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.360
She fed me that much I fell asleep
on her couch, didn't I?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.400
Do you know this guy?

17:01.560 --> 17:03.239
No. Should I?

17:03.240 --> 17:05.799
His name's Jason Daniels.
Ring any bells?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.439
Never heard of him.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.159
How about you, love?

17:09.160 --> 17:10.679
Sorry.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.039
There's no need to be sorry.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.598
I just want to eliminate you
from our enquiries.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.679
Actually, would you mind coming
down to the station

17:16.680 --> 17:18.159
so I can take your fingerprints?

17:18.160 --> 17:19.679
- Are you charging me?
- No.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.398
So I'll pass.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.239
Come on, let's go.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.398
I will need to take
a statement from you, though, love.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.280
So probably best that you come
down to the station.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.320
On your own.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.639
Oh, good.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.319
Oh, back off, Mum. It's for work.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.039
I'm looking for someone specific.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.119
How are you meant to find
someone on this, anyway?

17:45.120 --> 17:47.759
Well, you gotta register.
Put in your e-mail address.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.440
- Uh, no way.
- Well, use mine. Oh, budge over.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.160
Right...

18:04.680 --> 18:06.479
We're in.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.439
What's his age?

18:08.440 --> 18:11.239
- 36.
- 35 to 37.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.479
Do you want his name?

18:12.480 --> 18:15.679
People don't use their names.
Only usernames.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.159
- Have you never used a dating site before?
- No.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.359
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.920
- Seriously?
- Seriously!

18:22.000 --> 18:23.559
Distance?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.119
Er... five miles.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.160
Here we go.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.959
No.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.759
There's more.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.320
That's him.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.160
Only me.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.200
All right, my lover.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.279
What's all this nonsense?

18:44.280 --> 18:45.719
Er, nothing.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.119
Oh, you're not thinking of buying
a flat from this fly-boy, are ya?

18:49.120 --> 18:51.799
I mean, yeah,
it's time you had your own place.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.039
Bit embarrassing living at home
with your mum at your age.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.279
- You know Jason Daniels?
- Oh, yeah.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.599
Wide-boy. It's all dirty tricks
and dodgy deals with him.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.959
You say that about every
successful businessman.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.559
No, I don't. Anyway, I've had
dealings with this little runt.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.399
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Tried to do me out of the Black Dog.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.759
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.839
Yeah. Offers to buy me out for
a ridiculously low price.

19:13.840 --> 19:17.239
I refuse. Next thing,
there's bother. Fights every night.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.199
Break-ins. Place getting trashed.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.479
- Couldn't prove anything, of course.
- It was terrible.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.039
But you didn't sell, obviously.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.879
No. I just threatened
to tell his wife.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.439
How would you know his wife?

19:28.440 --> 19:30.479
Oh, it's not hard to find
out about her.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.639
Real high-flyer. Stocks and shares
and all that kind of stuff.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.879
Look her up.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.199
Yeah, I don't think she'd like to
find out how much of

19:37.200 --> 19:38.520
a low-life he really is.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.320
Tidy little wife she is, too.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.200
Not as tidy as you, my love.
Not even close.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.559
Well, there's Davey's car.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.159
- Yeah. Ah, and here he is.
- All right, Davey!

19:53.160 --> 19:56.759
What are you doing here?
What are you hoping to find?

19:56.760 --> 19:58.999
Anything to give us
a handle on Fred Clegg. You?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.319
Speaking to the neighbours.
Killing time, really.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.199
- Till I can nail Steve Johnson.
- Really?

20:03.200 --> 20:04.639
Who's Steve Johnson?

20:04.640 --> 20:06.279
Er, Adele Lesley's ex.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.239
I got a bad feeling about
that guy from the word go.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.359
I've seen enough domestic
violence in my time.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.599
You think he hits her?

20:12.600 --> 20:14.639
Well, maybe not yet.
But he's got it in him.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.679
He did it, Jane.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.959
He's got a flimsy alibi,
he's got a motive.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.639
He refused to co-operate
with the police.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.679
He's got a black car,
it's got a dent in it.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.079
I just gotta get forensics to put
that car at the crime scene,

20:24.080 --> 20:25.360
game over.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.640
Whoa, hold on.
Keys to Fred Clegg's flat?

20:31.920 --> 20:35.999
Well, I suppose I can't stop you,
but you're wasting your time.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.200
It's in the bag.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.239
You know, Davey's too confident.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.639
Yeah, we're missing something
with Fred Clegg.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.120
I mean, money under the bed,
false ID.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.280
Who are you?

21:19.960 --> 21:21.239
Stay back!

21:21.240 --> 21:22.879
- All right. - Back!
- All right. All right.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.120
- Let me go! - Keep calm.
- Let her go! Let her go!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.559
You go, I'll get Davey.

21:28.560 --> 21:29.600
OK.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.280
Enough! Enough!

21:56.680 --> 21:57.920
Calm down!

21:59.560 --> 22:01.439
It was a one-night stand, all right?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.959
But I couldn't find my bracelet.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.279
Didn't have his number.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.239
Then I read in the paper the guy's
dead, recognised the name.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.759
Hit and run, it said.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.559
So, I'm thinking better take matters
into your own hands, Jinty, my girl.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.119
Once the family swoop in, you'll
never see that bracelet again.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.519
So you broke in?

22:16.520 --> 22:17.599
No. I told you.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.279
That lock was broke
when I got there.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.719
Why didn't you call the police?

22:20.720 --> 22:26.639
Respect for the guy's memory.
Fred, that's right. Fred's memory.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.199
Didn't want the fuzz digging into
his sex life and that.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.799
Really. Is that the best you can do?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.079
It's the truth.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.799
Well, you may have had
a one-night stand.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.279
And you may have thought the guy had
a bit of money stashed away.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.319
And you may have read he was dead, so you
saw your opportunity and you broke in.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.759
- I never. How many times?
- Well, you didn't report a break-in to the police, did you?

22:42.760 --> 22:45.039
Two witnesses saw you
ransacking the place.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.079
And I know you've got
a criminal record.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.439
Joyriding. Shoplifting.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.039
So, I may just charge you with
burglary with intent.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.440
No way. Come on, Jinty. Sit down.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.679
I think you can help us.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.720
How?

22:58.880 --> 23:00.479
Tell us about Fred Clegg.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.359
Did you meet him on a dating site?

23:02.360 --> 23:05.879
No way. Creeps and losers,
that's all you find on there.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.919
Oh, great. My mum keeps trying
to get me to join one.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.159
- Your mum?
- Yeah, I know.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.959
Look, Jinty, Fred Clegg was killed
in suspicious circumstances,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.839
so anything you can tell us,
you know, that would help us.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.639
Anything, anything at all.

23:17.640 --> 23:21.919
He liked it rough.
The rougher the better.

23:21.920 --> 23:22.960
I mean rough.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.919
Slapping, hitting,

23:25.920 --> 23:27.799
shoving, slamming you
right up the...

23:27.800 --> 23:29.439
Yeah, all right. I get the idea.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.119
I knew sex was important to him
when I saw that tattoo.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.480
What tattoo?

23:35.240 --> 23:38.720
Fred Clegg?
Can you describe him to me?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.199
About five ten. Dark hair.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.519
Blue eyes. Smooth skin. No tattoos.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.519
Remind you of anyone?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.919
Now, we can test Fred Clegg's sheets
for your DNA

23:51.920 --> 23:54.120
or we can do it easily.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.239
All right, I'll tell you.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.679
Then you can back off.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.160
Go on.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.799
I love my wife. I really do.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.840
I adore her.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.119
But, well, she's a workaholic.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.600
She never switches off and when
she does, she's just too tired.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.359
Anyway, in my position,
women throw themselves at me

24:20.360 --> 24:25.039
all the time. I've fallen for it
before. Gold-diggers.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.799
The type that want Anna to find out
so they can get their hooks in.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.919
I've nearly lost her
because of them.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.239
So?

24:32.240 --> 24:34.519
Then I hooked up with Fred.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.679
Turns out we're from
the same council estate.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.439
Fancy that.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.719
Fred was footloose and fancy-free,
but no money.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.959
And I had all this dosh and
nothing to do with it.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.440
So you swapped lives?

24:45.600 --> 24:48.039
It's liberating,
getting to be someone else.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.959
Fred got to pull all the up-market
birds and I got to have

24:50.960 --> 24:52.440
some fun with no strings.

24:53.800 --> 24:57.920
It was an arrangement, that's all.
A bit of harmless fun.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.880
I love my wife. I adore her.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.000
So you said.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.879
I've never heard anything like it.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.679
Me neither. It's gross.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.679
He claims to love his wife.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.359
So why go to those lengths to cheat?

25:14.360 --> 25:16.599
Marriage? The eternal mystery.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.359
Who knows what makes
people stick it out.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.160
The hold one person
has over another.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.920
Hello... Yeah, go on, yeah.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.119
Oh, really?

25:28.120 --> 25:29.560
You're sure?

25:30.760 --> 25:31.880
All right, thanks.

25:33.320 --> 25:37.039
Steve Johnson's car. Tyre tread
doesn't match the crime scene.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.639
Doesn't mean he didn't do it,
though.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.840
It just means
he didn't use his own car.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.599
What?

25:43.600 --> 25:46.159
You're fixating on him.
You need to look away.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.599
Check out Anna Daniels.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.440
Maybe she found out about this
sordid little deal with Fred Clegg.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.280
Well, well.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.080
That's interesting.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.320
Hello, there. Uh, could you put me through to the
Planning Department, please? Thank you.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.199
What? You got beat up by a girl?

26:33.200 --> 26:36.079
- Come on, it's not funny.
- No, it's not. She was like a wildcat.

26:36.080 --> 26:41.559
- Yeah, she was totally out of control.
If Jane hadn't pulled her off...
- You mean Jane saved you?

26:41.560 --> 26:44.159
Stop it. Pack it in,
the pair of you.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.400
Hey, have you got a second?

26:46.640 --> 26:49.999
Jason Daniels' business is
in serious trouble.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.159
- Really?
- Yeah. You know the 40 new harbour flat conversions?

26:53.160 --> 26:55.759
Well, he's pressed ahead without
the right planning permission.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.199
So he's got to rip out the
staircases, replace the roof.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.919
Pay back the deposits.
And he's got a cash-flow problem.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.479
And, for the record, I take
no pleasure in that whatsoever.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.799
What about his wife?

27:06.800 --> 27:09.959
- Yeah, I did some digging on her as well.
- Oh yeah, Ways and Means Act?

27:09.960 --> 27:12.559
Something like that, yep.
She is hugely successful.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.839
Works 24/7 and he plays the field.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.919
No wonder she'd want to
get rid of him.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.279
If he was my husband, I would've
done him in by now.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.959
Yeah, I don't think she's got
the head space to plan a murder.

27:21.960 --> 27:24.799
I think you're missing something.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.639
See if I can get something
out of her.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.680
I doubt it.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.520
Hello, Beth... No, your mum's just
looking for her phone.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.360
Yeah, OK. Yeah, I'll tell her.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.679
All right, but I want you back
by ten.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.480
OK. Bye-bye.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.399
Beth - she's going to her friend
Daisy's house tonight to study.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.279
Oh, you've got a message.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.479
Give me my phone.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.359
- Leo?
- What?

27:51.360 --> 27:52.399
Perfect Pair.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.599
Give me that! Davey!

27:54.600 --> 27:56.199
Well, hello, Leo.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.360
Ooh, he's muscly!

28:02.080 --> 28:03.800
No. No, no, no.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.399
- I'm not apologising.
- "Best feature - long legs."

28:08.400 --> 28:09.559
Mum, how could you?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.719
I did it for you.
To help you meet someone.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.279
I don't want to meet someone.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.840
Well, 34 men want to meet you.
And look at all these winks.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.959
"So, guys,
I'm waiting to hear from you."

28:20.960 --> 28:23.559
"But don't worry, I won't bite -
unless you ask me nicely."

28:23.560 --> 28:24.999
It's good, isn't it?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.839
I want this wiped
before Beth sees it.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.039
Beth's not here.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.160
It's not the point.
Just get me off it!

28:32.000 --> 28:33.999
Ooh, he's nice.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.919
Can I leave that with you? OK, bye.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.239
Bye.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.679
Sorry, I appreciate you're busy,

28:39.680 --> 28:42.319
- I just wondered if you could spare ten minutes.
- Five.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.359
Right. Ah, the thing is

28:44.360 --> 28:47.479
we think the attack still might have
been meant for your husband.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.559
Are you sure you can't think of
anyone who would want to hurt him?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.200
No, I can't think of anyone.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.199
Can I ask how things are
between you?

28:56.200 --> 28:58.439
I'm sorry?

28:58.440 --> 29:01.479
You are two very busy people,
with two separate,

29:01.480 --> 29:03.439
high-powered businesses to run.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.040
It can put a strain on a marriage.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.799
What are you getting at?

29:08.800 --> 29:11.599
Do you know something about
my husband?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.399
I'm sorry, I can't reveal
the source.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.200
But it has come to light that...

29:16.480 --> 29:19.439
..J Daniels Developments is in
serious trouble.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.919
Well, yes. That much I do know.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.639
You do?

29:23.640 --> 29:28.479
Yes, a planning screw-up or
some such. Cash-flow problems.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.800
Anyway, I can lend him the money
until it all comes good.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.240
Is there anything else?

29:35.480 --> 29:36.879
Are you happy?

29:36.880 --> 29:38.319
I beg your pardon?

29:38.320 --> 29:40.079
I just asked if you're happy?

29:40.080 --> 29:42.360
Well, of course I am.
I love my work.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.279
- Hi, there.
- What do you want?

29:52.280 --> 29:54.199
Is she in? Your boss?

29:54.200 --> 29:56.159
No. You can leave a message.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.480
I'll just wait.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.999
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I really need to get on.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.439
Your poor face. Did I do that?

30:04.440 --> 30:05.960
I'm really very busy.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.359
You felt it, too, didn't you?

30:12.360 --> 30:14.439
I think you should go
and come back...

30:14.440 --> 30:17.279
Oh, come on.
Remember what it was like?

30:17.280 --> 30:20.479
On the ground? Me on top of you?

30:20.480 --> 30:21.719
That spark?

30:21.720 --> 30:25.519
Imagine we'd kept going.
What would that have been like?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.799
Ow, don't...

30:27.800 --> 30:29.279
Everything all right?

30:29.280 --> 30:32.919
Jane, hi, hi. There's someone,
someone here to see you.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.160
I'll get you a coffee.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.239
How can I help?

30:37.240 --> 30:39.759
That guy.
The one that I thought was Fred.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.439
How do I get in touch?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.679
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.880
Well, can you do me a favour, then?

30:47.400 --> 30:49.000
Give him this from me.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.719
Gonorrhea.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.280
Tell him I'm sorry.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.280
This is from Jinty Morgan.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.479
You came all the way over here
to give me this?

31:22.480 --> 31:24.799
How thoughtful to go to all
that trouble.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.879
I'm investigating a man's death.
Nothing is too much trouble.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.999
I appreciate that, but this is
my personal life.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.439
If my wife finds out about it,
it would finish us.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.560
You're not going to tell her,
are you?

31:38.320 --> 31:41.199
Please, I'm begging you.
She's everything to me.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.640
I'm nothing without her.

32:00.120 --> 32:03.439
She's out. You are?

32:03.440 --> 32:05.319
Jason Daniels.

32:05.320 --> 32:06.759
Ah.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.999
I take it you've heard all about me?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.719
What a bad boy I've been?

32:11.720 --> 32:13.919
Yes, well...

32:13.920 --> 32:16.040
I'm sorry. You're embarrassed.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.879
But you know what, so am I.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.279
Anyway, the coroner won't be back
till later, so...

32:21.280 --> 32:23.039
She despises me, doesn't she?

32:23.040 --> 32:24.359
No.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.520
Why wouldn't she?
I've not exactly been co-operative.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.680
That's why I'm here. To apologise.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.799
How do you think she'll take it?

32:35.800 --> 32:38.039
She's quite a scary lady, your boss.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.280
Yeah, yeah, she can be. Sometimes.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.840
You OK?

32:46.240 --> 32:48.880
Gut's playing up.
All this stress.

33:02.920 --> 33:09.759
Must've gone down the wrong way.
Sorry.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.759
Do you want me to get you something?
Some water?

33:11.760 --> 33:13.000
Please.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.000
Look at that car!

33:42.360 --> 33:44.040
Jinty? Remember me?

33:45.800 --> 33:47.080
What do you want?

33:49.480 --> 33:50.520
Get in.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.439
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Guess what?

34:04.440 --> 34:07.639
- What?
- We've found the car that ran Fred Clegg off the road.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.119
- Where?
- 80 miles away. Stolen vehicle.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.958
And the prints match those
on the Porsche.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.359
Did you speak to Anna Daniels?

34:13.360 --> 34:15.279
Yes, but I think you're right.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.518
I don't think it was her.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.719
Oh, I need to sit down.
You think I'm right?

34:20.040 --> 34:22.359
Yeah, she didn't know about
the other woman.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.079
She is spectacularly single-minded.
I mean, no personal life.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.239
Work-focused. Totally driven.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.839
Sad, really.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.359
Oh, and I paid Jason Daniels
a visit.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.839
Why?

34:33.840 --> 34:37.438
Jinty Morgan's asked me to give him
a card from the Berklay Clinic.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.679
Oh, I'd have done that for you
gladly.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.239
Jinty.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.279
Can I help you?

34:45.280 --> 34:47.199
- I just want a quick word.
- Sure, come up.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.520
No, you're all right.
It won't take long.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.239
What I told you...
About the gonorrhea.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.958
Thing is, I made it up.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.919
Sorry?

34:58.920 --> 35:00.639
I just wanted to get back
at the guy.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.319
For lying to me.
You know, give him a fright.

35:03.320 --> 35:07.239
But I feel a bit bad about it now so I
reckon I should let him off the hook.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.839
He got to you, didn't he?

35:08.840 --> 35:10.599
I don't know what you mean.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.759
How could he?
He doesn't know where I live.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.520
He doesn't even know my name.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.559
He was here to see you.
To apologise.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.959
And you believed him? You idiot.
He was here for one thing only.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.400
Jinty Morgan's address.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.400
It's not your fault.
You've been played by an expert.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.959
- Goodnight, Guv.
- Yeah, night, John.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.040
See you tomorrow.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.440
Sorry, love.
Yeah, I didn't realise the time.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.320
Yeah, still at my desk.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.360
Not getting very far, though,
so I'll probably head home soon.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.000
All right. See you shortly.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.120
Hello, yeah?

36:35.560 --> 36:36.640
Really? When?

36:38.440 --> 36:40.600
OK, fine. Bye, cheers.

36:46.240 --> 36:50.279
- Davey?
- You fancy going clubbing tonight?

36:50.280 --> 36:54.279
- Did my mum put you up to this?
- What? No.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.639
I do not need to "go out and enjoy
myself." I do not need to "get a life".

36:57.640 --> 36:59.319
All right, calm down.

36:59.320 --> 37:02.559
- Steve Johnson's been spotted going into
Jason Daniels's nightclub.
- What?

37:02.560 --> 37:04.719
Yeah, I put a tail on him.
Looks like it paid off.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.159
I wouldn't get too excited.
He could just be going clubbing.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.199
Well, we've got nothing else to go on,
have we? May as well check it out.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.240
Or have you got something more
exciting to do?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.279
20 minutes?

37:15.280 --> 37:16.440
20 minutes.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.120
All right, just try and blend in.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.319
Good night, guys.

37:37.320 --> 37:41.279
Hi, there, I think we're on the
guest list? Mr and Mrs Higgins?

37:41.280 --> 37:42.720
Yes, they're fine.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.240
Thanks. Cheers, mate.

37:52.600 --> 37:53.879
Like a drink?

37:53.880 --> 37:55.559
Um, I'm with someone.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.799
There's not enough fire exits
in this place.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.520
Don't leave me on my own again.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.999
And those are underage.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.280
Just ignore it.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.319
Look at that.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.880
If that deal goes down,
I'm hauling them in.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.479
Here, look, here he is,
Steve Johnson.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.840
He works here?!

38:26.280 --> 38:28.280
Right, I'm hauling him in, anyway.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.999
All right, you leave this one to me.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.839
You let me do the talking.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.799
No, Stevie. No, no!

38:55.800 --> 38:58.479
- What did I tell you!
- No! Please!

38:58.480 --> 39:02.440
Police! Open the door! Police!

39:06.840 --> 39:08.080
Adele!

39:09.720 --> 39:11.200
It's all right. It's all right.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.880
Ambulance, please.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.800
All right! You're under arrest for
assault and GBH with intent.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.399
I want those results as soon as.
You got that.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.640
Top priority.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.479
I just gave him a kicking.
I didn't kill him.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.879
As good as.
Because he wound up dead.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.599
I didn't mean to. I swear.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.519
I was doing it for her. For Adele.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.799
To get her back.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.719
So you could use her as a punchbag?

39:58.720 --> 40:00.359
She should be with me.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.039
Well, right now, she's in A&E

40:02.040 --> 40:04.720
getting her face stitched
and her bones set.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.800
I never meant to hurt her.
I love her.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.040
She's everything to me.
I'm nothing without her.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.719
I don't know what you're
talking about.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.559
Yes, you do. Steve Johnson.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.159
He works as a bouncer in
your nightclub.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.799
You have any idea how many
people work for me?

40:30.800 --> 40:33.599
He's just been arrested for
killing Fred Clegg.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.999
Good for you. You got your man.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.160
You can go now.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.799
Any time you like.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.920
You put him up to it.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.239
Fred Clegg knew
he was on to a good thing.

40:44.240 --> 40:47.839
But he wanted more.
So he threatened to tell your wife.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.639
You paid him off but
he wouldn't go away.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.399
When you found the connection with
Steve Johnson, that must have

40:53.400 --> 40:55.199
been the answer to your prayers.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.079
- All you had to do was work him from the back.
- Oh, please.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.079
Like you did Jinty.
And my assistant.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.879
You dripped poison into
Steve Johnson's ear.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.920
Then you sat back and let him deal
with Fred Clegg for you.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.400
And what if I did?
I've committed no crime.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.440
You can't touch me, and you know it.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.079
Davey?

41:46.080 --> 41:48.519
- Oh, cheers, Judith.
- What happened?

41:48.520 --> 41:51.159
Oh, that,
it's just a guy resisting arrest.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.799
We got him, though.
Nasty bit of work. Killer.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.040
Good on you.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.039
On the house. Action man.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.319
Cheers, mate.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.120
Oh, thanks.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.159
What kept you?

42:04.160 --> 42:05.560
Just a loose end.
