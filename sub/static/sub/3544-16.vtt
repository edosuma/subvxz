00:02.160 --> 00:03.605
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.760 --> 00:07.287
- My name's Aaron Whitmore.
- Whitmore? So you, like, own this school?

00:07.880 --> 00:10.770
I Passengered myself
into Elena's cute little head.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.651
I'm sorry, Damon. We're over.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.087
Elena thinks I'm a monster. She's right.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.850
Agh!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.446
Wes has this sick little scheme
to destroy vampires...

00:20.600 --> 00:22.489
by making them feed on each other.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.051
Damon, stop.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.285
Which one of you is gonna get to kill
the elusive Katherine Pierce...

00:28.440 --> 00:30.442
once and for all?

00:32.600 --> 00:34.807
Well, you're here. It means you're dead.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.721
True. I left Elena
with a little bit of a parting gift.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.881
Woo! Ha-ha-ha!

00:50.040 --> 00:51.201
What is she doing?

00:56.560 --> 00:58.801
- Woo!
- Well, having fun obviously.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.962
About time too. Take it off.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.731
- Woo!
- Matt.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.006
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.844
Jeremy, come on.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.127
To friends.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.685
To friends.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.967
Am I seriously that easy to impersonate...

01:31.120 --> 01:33.009
or do you guys not know me at all?

01:35.160 --> 01:37.003
What?

01:38.360 --> 01:39.850
Elena, what's going on?

01:40.040 --> 01:42.611
When have I ever
danced on a bar half-naked?

01:42.960 --> 01:47.727
You think I would come to a college bar
with my brother and do tequila shots?

01:47.880 --> 01:51.930
- Elena, what are you talking about?
- I'm not Elena, Matt. I'm Katherine.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.521
It's not me. You guys know me.
I would never do that.

01:54.680 --> 01:59.561
Guys, Katherine has taken over my body.
This isn't me.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.564
Hello?

02:34.280 --> 02:36.009
Hello?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.690
Hello?

02:43.640 --> 02:44.766
Hey.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.081
You're awake.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.047
Stefan, what are you doing here?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.089
- Where is everyone?
- Everyone's gone.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.802
Whole school cleared out for spring break.
You've been in-and-out since you first woke up.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.442
Oh. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.046
I thought I was going crazy.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.969
- What's going on? What...?
- We had to seal you into the building.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.130
We have a lot of catching up to do.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.170
Last I remember,
I was running through the woods...

03:24.320 --> 03:28.120
and my head felt like it was being
attacked by Katherine's whole life.

03:28.280 --> 03:32.649
Then I saw Damon,
I threw my arms around him...

03:32.800 --> 03:34.006
and then nothing.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.640
Yeah, that was about three weeks ago.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.126
Three weeks ago?

03:39.440 --> 03:41.044
Wow.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.326
Three weeks, huh?

03:43.840 --> 03:48.607
Yet it took just one second for Katherine
to infect me with some virus...

03:48.760 --> 03:50.762
that makes me wanna kill all my friends.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.243
You know Katherine. She's not about
to go out without a grand finale.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.684
Do you really think this whole lockdown
is necessary?

03:57.880 --> 03:58.927
I mean, I feel fine.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.923
Look, we shouldn't take any chances.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.482
If Damon taught us anything, it's that
the virus makes you wanna attack...

04:04.680 --> 04:08.287
- ...at the mere scent of vampire blood.
- Well, how did you...?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.966
:5?

04:12.120 --> 04:15.647
She's a new witch.
Bonnie's been teaching her some spells.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.526
I know that this is a lot to process,
but just know...

04:18.680 --> 04:20.966
that Caroline is out
looking for an antidote.

04:21.120 --> 04:25.762
And in the meantime, we figured out a way
to ration blood to keep you satiated.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.844
We're gonna figure this out. Okay?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.605
I need to talk to Damon.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.041
Hilarious.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.201
Give me the damn cup.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.563
Ugh.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.445
Wipe that smile off your face.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.443
Hey, you're lucky I'm even helping you.

05:06.600 --> 05:10.002
Considering the last thing you did for me
was tell Enzo to strangle me.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.841
- Quit crying. You're still around.
- More than we can say for Aaron Whitmore.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.570
- Weren't he and Elena tight?
- Yep.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.323
- Does she know Damon killed him?
- I don't know. Does she?

05:19.480 --> 05:23.166
No, she doesn't
because I'm gonna be the one to tell her.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.403
And if either one of you clowns beats
me to it, I'll rip your tongue out.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.600
Don't even think about it.

05:30.760 --> 05:31.886
Damon's phone.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.890
- Jer?
- Elena. Hey, how you feeling?

05:35.080 --> 05:39.130
Confused, but good. I miss you.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.011
- Yeah. Same here.
- Killed you once before, Gilbert.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.366
I'll kill you again.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.965
Someone wants to speak to you.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.771
Agh.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.129
Hey, you.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.367
Hey, you.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.285
So eat anyone yet?

06:03.440 --> 06:06.967
Nope. So far, I am symptom-free.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.084
Although, Stefan still has me
on the Damon diet just in case.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.006
Oh, yeah. It sucks. Oof.
You're gonna be craving carbs constantly.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.247
But hey, you know what?

06:15.400 --> 06:18.210
There's a plus side.
You get to keep your girlish figure.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.368
I'm calling you on a pay phone.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.090
<i>Well, how retro of you.</i>

06:25.240 --> 06:28.130
Does that mean you memorized
my phone number?

06:28.640 --> 06:29.846
<i>Maybe.</i>

06:30.000 --> 06:33.288
Katherine put a passcode on my cell,
so I can't use it.

06:33.440 --> 06:38.446
Oh, that would explain all those crazy
lnstagram pics you've been uploading lately.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.644
- What?
- Kidding. Kidding.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.329
Damon, that's not funny. I don't know what
I've been doing for the last three weeks.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.084
<i>I know. I'm sorry.</i>

06:51.080 --> 06:53.526
Well, what do you wanna know?
I'll tell you.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.123
How did she do it?

06:57.280 --> 06:58.805
How did she do what?

06:59.760 --> 07:00.966
Break your heart.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.930
<i>Oh, that.</i>

07:04.680 --> 07:06.330
I don't know.

07:06.480 --> 07:10.371
It's not like it's been playing on a loop
over and over. So I don't really remember.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.562
I'm so sorry.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.645
I really am. I mean, the last thing I
remember, I was running into your arms.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.725
And I felt so safe.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.448
Well, it was all downhill from there.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.246
I wanted to fight for you.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.804
I still do.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.122
Oh, Elena.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.488
This second we're cured of this and don't
wanna rip each other's heads off...

07:40.640 --> 07:45.441
I am gonna hunt you down and give you
the most mind-blowing night of your life.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.962
I think I could schedule you in.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.288
One question. How exactly do we cure this?

08:05.920 --> 08:09.320
<i>I've managed to extract
werewolf venom from Nadia Petrova's blood.</i>

08:09.440 --> 08:13.206
<i>The addition of the venom will make the
Ripper virus even more lethal to vampires.</i>

08:13.360 --> 08:14.486
Oh, my God.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.284
So werewolves are real.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.490
I always thought that was just,
like, you know, a joke.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.331
I'm Enzo.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.565
The Enzo.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.489
No, the other one.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.121
Heh. All right, Other Enzo.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.369
I don't know what you're doing,
but I don't want any part of it.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.682
I'm here for the same reason you are.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.491
I want this vampire-feeding virus
out of our lives.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.285
Why? You want your killing buddy back?

08:43.760 --> 08:46.809
Is killing innocent people
not as much fun when you're alone?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.004
Right. Damon mentioned you get
a little judge-y.

08:51.480 --> 08:55.201
But then again,
he also said you had a thing for accents.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.964
Just stay out of it.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.648
We don't need any more problems.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.960
Then you're not the least bit impressed
that I have the antidote?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.926
<i>Can we talk about
the irony of Katherine Pierce...</i>

09:12.080 --> 09:14.970
<i>- ...sitting through</i> a <i>college lecture?</i>
- Ha-ha-ha.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.600
Oh, no. I'm flunking, aren't I?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.006
No way.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.966
If anything, there's some sucker compelled
to spend his entire spring break...

09:23.160 --> 09:24.446
doing your homework.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.688
Yeah. You're probably right.

09:27.120 --> 09:31.011
Let's add that to the list of things I need to fix.
Starting with Aaron.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.491
Aaron? What the hell does he
have to do with anything?

09:35.640 --> 09:39.565
I haven't talked to him since he found out I was
a vampire and thought I wanted to kill him.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.885
Well, uh, you probably won't find him.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.170
Why?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.324
No reason.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.602
- Elena?
- Uh...

09:50.760 --> 09:53.366
Stefan just got here.
He bought me a new cell phone.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.002
I'm gonna call you right back. Okay?

10:00.480 --> 10:02.687
- Unh.
- You okay?

10:03.160 --> 10:06.846
Ah, not feeling so good all of a sudden.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.963
That's because you're starving.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.171
Yeah.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.040
Here, I got you four ounces of my blood.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.249
You won't be scaling any buildings,
but it will curb the cravings.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.523
Thank you.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.928
I need more.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.445
I'm sorry.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.407
I feel fine, Stefan. I just...

10:42.560 --> 10:44.961
- I just need a little more.
- You're not fine, Elena.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.811
Come on. Trust me. I just...

10:51.000 --> 10:52.525
I can handle this.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.250
- Think so?
- Yeah.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.085
You're not fine, Elena.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.082
She's turned me into a monster.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.771
I'm a Ripper, aren't I?

11:13.920 --> 11:15.809
You'll feed until you kill, yeah.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.523
I hate her.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.364
No, you know what?

11:20.520 --> 11:22.010
I hate myself.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.965
I was dumb enough to sit next to her
while she was dying...

11:25.160 --> 11:27.162
and actually forgive her.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.529
- Hey.
- Please tell me that's some good news.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.604
Bad news. It's not the same virus.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.886
What is it?

11:37.040 --> 11:40.249
Dr. Creepenstein was working
on the next phase of his virus.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.046
When Nadia was sick,
he was experimenting on her blood...

11:43.200 --> 11:47.762
and he figured out a way to extract werewolf
venom from her blood and put it into the virus.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.850
Wait. What do you mean werewolf venom?
That means it's fatal.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.240
Oh, my God.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.405
Hello. You don't think I would just drop
this on you without a silver lining.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.483
There's an antidote.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.801
It just requires you to come meet me.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.371
I'll text you the address.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.931
You could just bring it here.

12:05.080 --> 12:08.766
No. You have to go there. And don't
ask me why because I can't tell you.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.088
This doesn't make sense.
Just tell me exactly...

12:11.240 --> 12:13.641
If I could, don't you think
I would be there to help?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.326
<i>- I'll</i> text you the address.
- I'm not going anywhere...

12:16.480 --> 12:18.403
until you tell me what's going on.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.161
The Travelers don't want anyone to know
what they're up to. And by "anyone"...

12:25.320 --> 12:27.766
I mean newbie, emo witch-types with
bad attitudes.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.886
Just get there fast, okay?

12:34.160 --> 12:35.685
I'll see you soon.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.050
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

12:39.560 --> 12:40.766
Yeah?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.524
Why did she stay?

12:45.920 --> 12:48.526
- What do you mean?
- Katherine.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.247
Why didn't she run like she normally does?
Why did she stay?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.490
Ah.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.324
Well, you know Katherine.
Staying alive wasn't enough.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.045
She, uh ""

13:01.840 --> 13:03.763
She wanted it all.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.604
You mean you.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.045
She wanted you.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.444
- Did we ever...?
- Actually, we, uh...

13:22.160 --> 13:23.889
We kissed.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.681
Oh, okay. Um...

13:32.360 --> 13:35.489
- And then...?
- Then I pulled away.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.567
And I put it together.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.849
She wasn't you.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.691
I gotta go.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.167
I mean, you gotta admit. It was pretty rad.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.041
I locked a vampire in her dorm
with an invisible seal.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.283
I mean, how many newbie witches
have that on their resume?

14:06.440 --> 14:09.762
- If they do, they don't brag about it as loudly.
- Oh, come on.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.251
This place is dead.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.681
It's like serious spring break-itis.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.366
Besides, you're not even
a little proud of me?

14:16.720 --> 14:18.290
Okay, hotshot.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.563
- Set it on fire.
- What?

14:26.760 --> 14:28.125
Simple fire spell.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.891
Okay.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.161
That's weird.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.484
Guess your resume
still needs a little padding.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.520
Hey, <i>it's</i> Aaron. <i>Leave me</i> a message.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.808
<i>Or don't. Whatever.</i>

15:14.280 --> 15:17.284
Hey, Aaron. It's Elena.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.363
I, uh... Ahem.

15:19.560 --> 15:25.363
I hope that you're off on some private island
somewhere, enjoying your spring break.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.171
Look. A lot has happened.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.169
And I'd really like to talk about it.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.483
If you're still willing to talk to me.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.248
So call me back, okay?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.404
All right. Bye.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.050
<i>Dear Diary, I love my life.</i>

16:04.200 --> 16:07.044
<i>Seriously, becoming Elena Gilbert
is the best thing...</i>

16:07.200 --> 16:08.804
<i>that has ever happened to me.</i>

16:08.960 --> 16:10.724
Oh, my God.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.201
<i>Spent the day on the road with Stefan.</i>

16:13.360 --> 16:16.728
<i>Although the highlight was our little
pit stop at the hotel.</i>

16:16.880 --> 16:22.171
<i>I had to wash up after "accidentally"
getting grease on my shirt. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

16:22.320 --> 16:23.845
<i>Mm.</i>

16:31.640 --> 16:34.723
Oh, well. I didn't like this shirt anyway.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.281
Ah... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.602
Hey. Warning next time?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.603
It's nothing you haven't seen before.

16:43.760 --> 16:48.129
I know. I'm just saying there's a bathroom
less than 1 O feet away.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.886
You know, that's what I like about you,
Stefan.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.370
Always a gentleman.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.281
You don't have to turn away, you know.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.204
There's nothing stopping us.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.488
We're both single now.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.404
And we're alone.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.282
Stefan, it's not me.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.726
It's Katherine, Stefan.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.245
She's seducing you. Stop.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.926
What are you doing?

17:49.480 --> 17:51.642
This isn't me, Stefan.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.649
Can't you tell?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.291
After everything we've been through.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.923
I wouldn't lead you on like that.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.847
Damon?

18:09.280 --> 18:12.124
Stefan, Stefan, Stefan.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.366
"I have grease on my shirt,
I need to wash up"?

18:15.720 --> 18:19.008
- Come on. The oldest trick in the book.
- Not like you saw through her.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.686
- I wasn't the one making out with her.
- Stop it, okay?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.970
Both of you.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.367
This is what she wants.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.483
Even dead, she is ruining our lives.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.324
Oh, you think this is bad?

18:34.520 --> 18:36.522
You have no idea, do you?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.169
About what?

18:40.760 --> 18:42.888
About what, Stefan?

18:59.600 --> 19:02.046
What the hell is happening to me?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.044
- He'll tell her.
- When?

19:07.200 --> 19:10.568
"Hey, Elena. I killed Aaron."
It's not exactly casual conversation.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.281
Killing someone in cold-blood isn't casual,
but Damon managed that just fine.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.771
Or I can just tell her.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.370
Considering I was lying in the road
when they stopped his car.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.130
So, what's in this for you?
Aside from getting Damon to undo...

19:23.280 --> 19:27.649
- ...every positive decision he's ever made.
- Is it such an anomaly for him to have a friend?

19:28.160 --> 19:31.846
- Well, if so, consider me honored.
- Okay. We're here. Where is the antidote?

19:45.960 --> 19:47.485
- Who are you?
- I'm Sloan.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.769
You met some of the Travelers
when they took a bucket of your blood.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.524
Oh, yeah. How could I forget?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.285
So you have the antidote
to this Ripper virus, correct?

19:56.440 --> 19:57.965
We do, thanks to Enzo.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.920
I was trapped in that bloody farmhouse
with Damon set to have my head torn off...

20:02.080 --> 20:04.970
when, out of nowhere, Wes,
with the Travelers, saved me.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.283
- On the condition I owed him.
- What does that have to do with us?

20:08.440 --> 20:11.284
He was low on vampires,
and needed one to continue his work...

20:11.520 --> 20:13.568
so I let him experiment on me.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.651
Among other things,
it allowed him to make an antidote.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.121
When he died, the Travelers took it.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.129
And seeing as Elena is valuable to us...

20:21.320 --> 20:25.041
we're in the process of using Wes'
resources to find a cure for her as well.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.608
- All right. When will it be done?
- First, we have to find something.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.250
Okay. What do you need?

20:31.400 --> 20:33.004
Another one of you.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.920
What do you mean, werewolf venom?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.804
I mean I'm deteriorating.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.166
Slowly.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.681
I seem to be hallucinating
all my worst fears.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.520
So that's been fun.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.762
- I should come over there.
- You can't.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.163
We would tear each other apart. Remember?

20:57.520 --> 21:00.205
Besides, I look gross.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.085
<i>Oh, yeah. Well, never mind.</i>

21:03.280 --> 21:04.850
It would be awful.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.323
<i>- Distract me.
- All right.</i>

21:08.840 --> 21:09.921
What are you wearing?

21:10.120 --> 21:11.929
Damon, come on.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.282
Tell me. What else have I missed?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.044
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see.</i>

21:16.200 --> 21:18.362
Um...

21:18.560 --> 21:20.050
It's been unseasonably cold.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.647
<i>Jeremy bought new Xbox games
that are ridiculously loud and obnoxious.</i>

21:23.840 --> 21:26.923
Tyler had a party. It was lame.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.201
<i>You hear the gossip?</i>

21:28.360 --> 21:29.691
What gossip?

21:29.840 --> 21:34.448
<i>Caroline and an Original hybrid,
sitting in a tree.</i>

21:34.640 --> 21:35.687
No.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.887
Yep.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.486
Are you serious? Caroline and Klaus?

21:39.640 --> 21:40.801
Mm-hm.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.406
- Wait. Does Tyler know about this?
<i>- Yep.</i>

21:43.560 --> 21:45.005
And guess who told him.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.409
Katherine?

21:48.560 --> 21:51.325
- Katherine is such a bitch.
- That she is.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.567
Hang on.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.084
Sorry. I...

22:03.240 --> 22:04.890
<i>You Okay?</i>

22:05.040 --> 22:06.405
Um...

22:07.600 --> 22:11.764
I just don't understand why Stefan's off
at some mystery location.

22:11.960 --> 22:15.089
<i>Why don't we hunt down Wes
and force him to make us an antidote?</i>

22:15.240 --> 22:17.242
Well, that's easier said than done.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.802
- Wes is <i>dead.</i>
- What?

22:20.280 --> 22:23.250
I killed him. And please don't act
like he didn't deserve it.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.044
What about Aaron, Damon?

22:25.200 --> 22:28.727
He didn't deserve that. Wes was pretty much
the closest thing that Aaron had to a family.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.123
Soup's on.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.488
The highlight of my day.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.441
I will check on you later. Okay?

22:37.600 --> 22:40.524
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.646
What do you mean
there's another one of me out there?

22:46.880 --> 22:50.168
Never thought there might be another
doppelganger roaming around?

22:50.320 --> 22:53.403
- Clearly, you don't know your Traveler lore.
- I'm sorry, and you do?

22:53.600 --> 22:57.002
Having stuck with them for a few weeks,
I've picked up a few things.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.488
Like how the last remaining pair
of doppelgangers are special.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.449
- Special how?
- None of your business.

23:02.600 --> 23:06.650
Excuse Sloan. She's under a bit of stress.
And the leader of the Travelers...

23:06.800 --> 23:08.529
- Marcus was it?
- Markos.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.969
Markos. See?... wants the blood
from the last pair of doppelgangers.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.162
- L.e., you and Elena.
- Why?

23:15.360 --> 23:17.442
- Apparently you're special.
- Special how?

23:17.960 --> 23:21.681
Don't think I didn't ask. As witnessed,
the Travelers are very secretive.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.491
We do know that until the last
doppelgangers gone...

23:24.680 --> 23:27.889
your blood, when mixed with Elena's,
doesn't do squat.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.481
You do a locator spell
to find this guy and kill him?

23:30.720 --> 23:31.881
More of a linking spell.

23:32.040 --> 23:36.170
Last time a witch linked me to my doppelganger,
she fried my brain and I lost my memory.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.244
Then we better be careful.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.041
Aaron?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.326
Hey there.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.771
I thought you were on spring break.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.442
- Are you okay?
- I'm sick.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.971
<i>' 'L</i>

24:21.120 --> 24:25.409
It's a long story. Look, I really wanted
to talk to you about everything.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.922
Because the last couple of weeks,
I haven't been myself. Literally.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.883
Katherine Pierce has been
inside my body and I...

24:33.040 --> 24:36.203
- That would explain a lot, actually.
- Why?

24:36.360 --> 24:38.169
Did I do something?

24:44.040 --> 24:46.361
Why is none of your stuff here?

24:46.520 --> 24:50.002
Because I'm not actually here.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.924
What do you mean?

24:56.240 --> 24:57.765
Are you another hallucination?

25:08.720 --> 25:09.881
Are you dead?

25:13.400 --> 25:15.607
Did I do this to you?

25:17.320 --> 25:19.163
Aaron, tell me...

25:19.320 --> 25:21.402
that I didn't kill you.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.450
Did I kill you?

25:23.600 --> 25:27.286
Tell me that I didn't kill you. Please, Aaron.
Tell me that I didn't kill you.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.800
No. No. No.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.128
No. No.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.645
Elena.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.285
- Elena. Heh.
- Unh.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.643
Wow, Elena Gilbert.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.886
Get up, you lush. Come on.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.881
Whoa. I see someone started
her spring break early.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.646
How did you get in here?
I thought the door was closed.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.848
David dumped my ass...

25:55.000 --> 25:59.005
at Señor Frog's, of all horrifying places.
He thought I was cheating on him.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.204
So I took the first flight out of Cancun,
and here I am.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.681
- Do I know you?
- I'm Luke.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.881
We met at the Bitter Ball.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.769
You're very drunk.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.327
All right. Let me shower off
this airplane stench...

26:13.520 --> 26:16.171
and we can drown our sorrows
in rum runners.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.964
Doesn't sound like a good idea.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.164
Don't tell me you and Stefan hooked up
while I was gone.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.325
Whoa, you okay?

26:23.560 --> 26:26.564
- I'm just so thirsty.
- Okay. We'll get you some water, all right?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.609
- Don't touch me.
- You need help.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.650
No. What I need is to feed.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.161
Don't move. I need vampire blood.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.806
What are you doing?

26:39.960 --> 26:41.849
I have to turn you. I'm sorry.

26:43.760 --> 26:44.966
What is that?

26:45.200 --> 26:46.326
What...?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.845
What is that?

26:48.080 --> 26:52.210
My paranoid boyfriend thought they were
hickeys, but they're obviously...

26:52.360 --> 26:54.522
some kind of disgusting rash
or something.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.162
Or your friend, "Elena,"
was feeding on you.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.280
Listen to me. Forget this conversation.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.484
Find Bonnie Bennett.
Tell her to come here and bring the witch.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.808
I need to get out of here right now.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.602
Go. Run.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.360
I don't know what's happening to me,
Damon.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.247
I know. Look. You're sick.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.925
So just try to relax.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.408
I feel like no one's telling me the truth.

27:26.560 --> 27:30.121
Damon? I can't tell what's real anymore.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.805
Stefan will be there really soon.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.284
I did it, didn't I?

27:34.440 --> 27:35.851
I killed him.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.286
- What?
- Aaron.

27:38.280 --> 27:42.001
That's what you're so afraid to tell me.
Aaron. I killed him.

27:42.160 --> 27:46.085
Listen, Elena, I will tell you everything,
but right now is not the time.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.163
Now is not the time, Damon?

27:48.320 --> 27:49.606
I'm dying.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.127
I almost turned a student today...

27:52.280 --> 27:54.487
that Katherine had
apparently befriended...

27:54.640 --> 27:57.644
just so that I could feed on him.
When would the good time be?

27:57.800 --> 27:59.802
Listen, Elena. Whoa. Calm down.

27:59.960 --> 28:03.123
Listen to my voice.
You will get through this. I will help you.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.369
No. No. No. You're lying.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.409
Damon, you're lying.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.449
Elena, calm down. Please.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.090
Why is everyone lying to me?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.651
<i>You're lying to me.</i>

28:13.800 --> 28:17.327
Why is everyone lying to me?

28:21.280 --> 28:22.611
<i>Hey"</i>

28:22.800 --> 28:23.847
Damn it.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.810
Donovan. Donovan, get your ass in here.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.445
Chill. I'm right here. What?

28:30.640 --> 28:32.130
Phone's dead. Charge it for me.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.564
Too much sexting with Elena?

28:36.160 --> 28:38.731
How about you never say that again?

28:46.960 --> 28:48.246
Damon, stop...

28:48.760 --> 28:50.091
Jeremy.

28:50.600 --> 28:54.047
- Whoa! What the hell?
- I need to see your sister.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.009
Undo my chains or I'll kill him.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.844
- I can't. You'll kill her.
- She's gonna hurt herself, Jeremy.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.241
- She's totally unraveling.
- Don't do it, Jeremy.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.562
Don't be an idiot, Jeremy. Trust me.

29:04.760 --> 29:05.921
She needs me.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.163
I'd never hurt her, Jeremy.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.810
I know there's a lot of them...

29:13.000 --> 29:15.526
but between you, me and Enzo,
I bet we can take them.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.125
Did you really just say that?

29:17.280 --> 29:18.725
Sorry. I'm desperate.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.531
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah. Until you lose your memory again.

29:21.680 --> 29:26.049
If I lose my memory, then I won't remember I had
anything to worry about in the first place.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.049
See? Win-win.

29:28.240 --> 29:31.801
Who volunteers themselves
for witch-y electric shock therapy?

29:32.040 --> 29:34.361
Me, and I would do it for you too.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.683
- Look. Let's just say that they do fry my brain...
- I'll kill them.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.366
Then you'll spiral out of control
about killing them.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.809
And then, do me a favor.
Remind me we were friends.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.807
That's for you. Sit.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.485
Where are the antidotes?

29:49.680 --> 29:52.889
- You'll get it when we're done.
- No. You'll hand them over right now.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.044
- I'm here. I'm doing everything you want me to.
<i>- I'll</i> take them.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.282
I'll make sure
the appropriate parties get them.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.447
- If you don't trust me, you're welcome to join.
- I'm gonna stay with Stefan.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.444
Very well. Best of luck.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.443
- Wait. You said you weren't gonna hurt him.
- I said I'd try not to.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.762
- We need his blood for the spell.
- Wait.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.566
Tessa didn't need my blood
when she linked me to Silas.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.208
Good for her. We do.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.807
Elena?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.445
What are you doing?

31:17.320 --> 31:20.130
I'm cleansing myself
of anything Katherine's ever touched.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.523
My toothbrush, my clothes, my sheets.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.603
Elena, stop. You're not yourself.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.604
Ironic because I wasn't myself for weeks
yet nobody noticed.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.171
She's losing it.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.922
Are you Liv? I'm sorry if we've met before.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.562
But I'm really gonna need you
to drop the seal and let me out right now.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.724
It's too dangerous for you
to be in public when you're sick.

31:42.640 --> 31:45.007
You think that's dangerous, Bonnie?

31:45.160 --> 31:47.640
If you don't drop the seal right now,
I will kill you.

31:47.840 --> 31:50.764
Elena, stop.
This is the virus. It's in your head.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.241
Katherine wanted to destroy you,
and it's working.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.686
You have to fight it.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.524
Oh, my God. You're right.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.324
You're right, Bonnie. You're right.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.130
I can't... I'm letting her win.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.329
I can't let her win. I'm
not gonna let her win.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.607
- Unh!
- Oh, my God. Liv!

32:10.760 --> 32:12.364
Oh, my God.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.322
You will die if I don't give you my blood,
so you have to drop the veil...

32:17.480 --> 32:19.881
otherwise, you're gonna bleed to death.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.084
So, really, it's your choice.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.648
Why is this taking so long?

32:44.840 --> 32:46.046
Just a little deeper.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.401
I'm in.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.649
You're gonna be okay. Stay still.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.322
She's going into shock. I need the BVM.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.402
Just stay with me. Just breathe in.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.561
I see him.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.324
He's in a city.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.080
- He's in Atlanta.
- Good. That's great.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.005
- You found him.
- Keep going. Push harder.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.130
Agh!

33:22.520 --> 33:25.000
You said you know where he is.
What are you doing?

33:25.160 --> 33:26.241
We're not done.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.489
The link is strong enough.
We need more information.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.449
You're pushing him too hard.
He's gonna lose everything. Stop.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.921
We need the doppelganger dead.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.445
- Louder.
- No.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.365
If you hurt me, they'll kill you.

33:50.520 --> 33:54.320
Tell them to stop.
There's a way we can all get what we want.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.525
Elena?

34:25.679 --> 34:26.806
Oh, my God.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.606
Aaron?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.529
Are you alive?

34:35.600 --> 34:36.965
You don't look so hot.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.326
I know.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.925
No. I'm good. I'm good now.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.128
I'm good now. I thought I killed you.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.130
I didn't kill you. You're right here.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.726
You're still alive.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.291
Heh... Aah!

34:49.480 --> 34:52.768
Elena, it's me. It's Damon.
Hey, you're hallucinating.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.491
Here. Drink this. It's Stefan's blood.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.051
Drink this.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.166
She won.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.601
Katherine won.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.967
- Don't say that.
- Look at me, Damon. Look at me.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.770
Look at me.

35:14.960 --> 35:18.806
The plague of Katherine Pierce lives on.
She's turning me into something I'm not.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.921
Look at me. I'm a monster.
Liv, the witch, I almost killed her.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.163
And my friends.
I mean, I don't wanna kill my friends.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.885
I think about killing my friends.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.326
- I'm here. It's okay
- No.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.161
No. It's not okay. What is...?
It's not okay, Damon.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.928
I killed Aaron Whitmore.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.241
- No.
- Yeah.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.845
- No.
- I keep seeing him.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.684
- He keeps popping up everywhere.
- No.

35:42.880 --> 35:46.248
- I'm hallucinating that Aaron's around. He's...
- No. Hey, look at me.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.165
You did not kill Aaron Whitmore.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.005
I did.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.005
What?

35:53.400 --> 35:54.731
What?

35:54.920 --> 35:56.604
Why?

35:56.760 --> 35:58.603
Was it because of the virus?

35:59.160 --> 36:00.810
Did you need to turn him?

36:00.960 --> 36:03.440
It was before I was infected.

36:06.600 --> 36:10.810
Listen, if you want specifics, it was the night
that I thought you broke up with me, Elena.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.725
I killed him to convince myself
that you were right.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.323
That I was the type of person who could kill
in cold-blood, and I was never gonna change.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.130
That's why.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.690
I need you to say something, please.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.041
Why is Enzo here?

36:34.560 --> 36:37.166
Sorry to interrupt, but...

36:37.320 --> 36:38.446
I have the antidote.

36:42.280 --> 36:45.727
Although, from the looks of it,
you'd both rather be dead.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.087
Ugh.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.969
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.760
Rebekah, hi.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.200
Oh, my God.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.642
I'm kidding.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.802
Lexi, right?

37:16.360 --> 37:18.488
- Funnier the first time.
- Did it work?

37:18.640 --> 37:21.644
Engine's running, blondie.
Appreciate the call. Let's go do this.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.650
Yeah.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.490
Did I miss something?

37:25.680 --> 37:29.048
Sloan was gonna fry your brain
in order to kill your other you.

37:29.200 --> 37:34.001
I wasn't about to let that happen.
So I may have volunteered...

37:34.160 --> 37:36.527
to help Enzo deal with it.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.168
You mean kill him?

37:42.800 --> 37:46.043
- Caroline, I can't let you...
- They only want one alive. Remember?

37:46.240 --> 37:47.287
It's you or him.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.922
All right, fine. Well, I'm coming with you.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.771
No, you aren't.
They need to use you to keep track of him.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.126
Ticktock, gorgeous.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.449
Time is of the essence.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.691
I'll be fine, Stefan.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.969
Besides, you'd do the same for me, right?

38:06.040 --> 38:07.530
I don't trust him.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.210
Don't worry.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.885
I don't either.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.563
I'll be safe. I promise.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.290
Guess we should donate my shirt
to Elena's fire cleanse.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.169
I'm so sorry about all this.

38:31.880 --> 38:36.010
I survived my first vampire attack. It's
just one more thing to add to the resume.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.403
Look. If you don't want any part of this,
I get it.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.086
Magic isn't for everyone.
I won't be offended.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.846
No. I want this.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.082
- And I want you to teach me.
- Good.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.720
See you tomorrow,
bright and early, for levitation.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.769
Awesome. Catch you tomorrow.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.921
Show off.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.560
Luke, what the hell?
I was about to take my shirt off.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.041
Relax. I'm gay and your brother...

39:06.200 --> 39:09.647
so technically, you're the least
attractive person in the world to me.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.325
You Okay?

39:11.480 --> 39:15.280
Sorry I had to drag you into this,
but Elena thought she was compelling me...

39:15.440 --> 39:17.647
- ...and I couldn't give up the ruse.
- I'm fine.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.485
After Elena gutted me,
she gave me some of her blood.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.450
And how is our precious anchor
to the Other Side?

39:23.600 --> 39:25.887
I'm letting her think
she's teaching me magic.

39:26.040 --> 39:30.170
- It's kind of cute.
- Until she realizes her friends are in jeopardy.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.845
Then not so cute.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.045
No.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.567
She speaks.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.841
Care to share anything else turning around
in that beautiful head of yours?

39:52.840 --> 39:54.808
You should've noticed.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.371
- What?
- That I was Katherine.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.488
That Katherine was me.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.688
You should've been the one that noticed.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.370
You don't think I know that?

40:09.560 --> 40:12.245
If only you'd seen through her, Damon.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.849
There would be no vampire virus.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.850
Aaron would still be alive.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.650
Katherine didn't do this.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.040
I did.

40:20.360 --> 40:23.091
I thought you broke my heart,
so I rip open Aaron's neck.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.686
That is how much control you have over me.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.764
And I'm still here.
That's how much control you have over me.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.570
Listen to us. This is toxic.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.202
We are in a toxic relationship, Elena.
I just killed your friend...

40:34.360 --> 40:36.761
and you find someone else to blame.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.769
You want me to blame you? Easy.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.049
Done. You screwed up, Damon. Again.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.090
- Thank you.
- You put me in a position...

40:45.240 --> 40:48.084
where I have to defend you again.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.925
Where I have to bend my morals again.

40:51.080 --> 40:56.564
Where I have to go against every single thing
that I believe in, again, because I love you.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.047
- Then stop loving me.
- I can't.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.286
Well, that's the problem. We don't work.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.285
I know.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.246
Then we agree.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.290
This has to end.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.965
<i>It</i> just did.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.600
It's over. We're over.
