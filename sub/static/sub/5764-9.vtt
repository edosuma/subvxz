Previously on "Ghost Whisperer..."
- why do your friends shine?

00:02.471 --> 00:04.938
Because they don't have faces. they're
made of light. but they're scared.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.306
What are they scared of, buddy?

00:06.373 --> 00:09.042
- Of the shadows.
- what kind of shadows are those?

00:09.110 --> 00:11.411
The ones they make from the parts
that get left behind.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.046
- Parts of what?
- people.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.547
Broken people.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.350
I've been trying to protect you.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.018
- You and Melinda.
- Melinda?

00:19.086 --> 00:20.220
- I've said too much.
- protect her from what?

00:20.287 --> 00:21.221
Is it the shadows?

00:21.288 --> 00:22.288
Stop asking so many questions!

00:22.356 --> 00:24.324
Don't ask any questions at all.

00:24.391 --> 00:28.328
Her name's Julia Miller
and she was a patient.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.597
According to this, she lives here
at the hospital

00:30.664 --> 00:32.365
Her whole life.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.167
No one can know I'm here.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.668
- Why not?
- if they find out,

00:35.736 --> 00:38.104
- Something bad will happen.
- what?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.707
Something really bad.

[gasps] oh.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.840
You scared me.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.009
That's not easy to do. um...

01:16.076 --> 01:18.178
What are you doing here?

01:18.245 --> 01:19.479
I'm waiting for Aiden.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.981
Ok, well, he's at school.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.217
And you don't belong here, so...

01:24.285 --> 01:26.186
- Have I seen you?
- it's his closet,

01:26.253 --> 01:28.221
And he said I could stay.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.958
Yeah, well, technically it's my house.

01:32.026 --> 01:35.028
And so I decide who's staying.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.096
[bang]

01:43.270 --> 01:44.470
[elevator dings]

01:44.538 --> 01:45.905
Julia Miller.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.073
The girl practically lived here.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.174
Yeah, I knew she looked familiar.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.009
- She had leukemia?
- Yeah, but she died last week,

01:50.077 --> 01:51.644
of pneumonia. Her immune system

01:51.712 --> 01:53.346
couldn't stand the cancer treatments.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.582
Isn't she the one who was sending those
creepy Sally Stitch emails?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.184
One of the many reasons I don't
want her near our son.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.386
Ok, but I thought you said
ghosts made her do it.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.223
Well, 11 is a little old
to still be seeing ghosts.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.691
But she was dying.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.226
Maybe she was sensitive.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.061
No, I don't know how to explain it.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.127
There's just something
not right about her.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.797
Says the woman
who just found out

02:10.864 --> 02:12.265
Her son was keeping a
ghost in his closet?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.900
I have a bad feeling
about this one.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.135
Very bad feeling.

02:16.203 --> 02:19.305
Ok. never a good sign.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.773
Yeah.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.677
It wasn't really a secret.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.613
I just didn't
tell you about it.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.048
- Yet.
- ok.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.650
But you know you should have
told us that Julia was here.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.018
Right?

02:32.086 --> 02:33.319
She didn't want me to.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.355
Well, then you were
keeping a secret, bud.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.623
That's how it works.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.458
We just don't have
secrets in our home, ok?

02:38.525 --> 02:41.728
Just with other people?

02:41.795 --> 02:44.230
Look, I know that
that can be confusing.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.632
Um...

02:45.699 --> 02:47.267
But it's not--
it's not good

02:47.334 --> 02:48.935
For Julia to be stuck here.

02:49.003 --> 02:52.105
You know? she's supposed to be
in the light with other ghosts.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.241
- I'm sorry, mom.
- hey,

02:55.309 --> 02:58.211
Maybe you can convince
Julia to talk to mom.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.245
Yeah.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.314
She doesn't like
talking to mom.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.416
Why not?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.585
She says you don't like her.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.587
Why makes her think that?

03:07.655 --> 03:10.590
'cause you don't want me
to learn how to do magic.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.226
Oh. [chuckles]

03:13.294 --> 03:16.362
Um, you know,
I just--

03:16.430 --> 03:19.599
I just don't like it
when ghosts hide in our house.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.901
Right? but what else
is she doing here?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.970
Besides teaching you
magic tricks?

03:24.038 --> 03:25.705
I don't know.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.940
All she wants to
talk about is magic.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.144
Well, why don't you
just promise to tell us

03:31.245 --> 03:32.745
Next time's Julia's here, ok?

03:32.813 --> 03:34.213
I love you.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.815
- Love you, too.
- ok.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.850
- Bath time.
- I don't want a bath.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.452
Ok. all right.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.221
We'll take some of this
into the bed.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.432
[creaking]

03:54.268 --> 03:56.202
[rumbling]

03:56.270 --> 03:58.805
[thunder]

03:58.872 --> 04:02.308
Julia, will you please
just talk to me?

04:02.376 --> 04:03.876
Look, I'm not angry
with you.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.916
That is not helping.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.984
[thud]

04:28.635 --> 04:31.204
Julia,
I can't do that.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.078
What do you want?!

04:40.147 --> 04:42.815
[thunder]

04:47.888 --> 04:49.889
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

Sync by honeybunny

05:19.010 --> 05:20.311
Julia Miller?
isn't she the same girl

05:20.979 --> 05:22.646
Who was sending
all those awful emails?

05:22.714 --> 05:24.047
Well, that's why
I'm worried.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.849
You know, what
if she's a bad
influence on Aiden?

05:26.917 --> 05:29.452
Mel, we do the best we can
to raise our kids.

05:29.519 --> 05:31.187
At some point,
they're going to pick friends

05:31.255 --> 05:32.788
That we wish they hadn't,
you know?

05:32.856 --> 05:33.990
Living or dead.

05:34.057 --> 05:34.991
Don't you remember
that ghost that got Ned

05:35.059 --> 05:36.593
To shoplift
from your store?

05:36.661 --> 05:38.595
Exactly, but you didn't
believe me then.

05:38.663 --> 05:40.730
Ok, well, I do now.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.100
And I may not have
any advice how to stop
playdates with ghosts,

05:44.168 --> 05:45.869
But I am telling you,
as a mother,

05:45.937 --> 05:46.870
You've got to trust
your instincts.

05:46.938 --> 05:48.205
You've got to cut it off.

05:48.272 --> 05:50.440
Yeah, but what
if she's staying
here for something?

05:50.508 --> 05:52.776
Or I can help her?
cut it off.

05:58.216 --> 06:02.285
Hey. well,
she's here
right now.

06:02.353 --> 06:04.554
Hey, Mel, this is
David and Linda.

06:04.622 --> 06:05.789
These are Julia's
parents.
hi.

06:05.856 --> 06:08.692
Your husband said
that you wanted
to talk to us.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.328
Something
about Julia?

06:11.395 --> 06:12.362
I'll be nearby.

06:12.430 --> 06:13.363
Thanks.
thank you.

06:13.431 --> 06:14.397
May I?

06:14.465 --> 06:16.900
Sure.

06:18.302 --> 06:20.370
I know about your loss,
and I'm so sorry.

06:20.438 --> 06:22.205
It must be
very difficult for you.

06:22.273 --> 06:23.440
Oh, thank you.

06:23.507 --> 06:24.841
There's some comfort
in knowing

06:24.909 --> 06:26.643
That our daughter's
finally at peace.

06:27.812 --> 06:29.312
I don't know
what Jim told you,

06:29.380 --> 06:32.949
And I know that this
is going to sound
a little strange.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.485
But I have a gift.

06:35.553 --> 06:37.354
I can see ghosts.

06:38.522 --> 06:40.657
Have you seen
our Julia?

06:40.725 --> 06:41.925
Yes.

06:41.993 --> 06:45.829
She's attached herself
to my 5-year-old son.

06:45.896 --> 06:48.198
Can we talk to her?

06:48.266 --> 06:51.968
She sort of shut us
out of her life
these past few months.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.536
She did?

06:53.604 --> 06:55.972
Yeah. we don't know why.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.841
The doctors say
there may have been

06:57.908 --> 07:00.043
Some psychological issues

07:00.111 --> 07:02.979
That resulted from being
alone in the hospital

07:03.047 --> 07:04.281
For so long.

07:04.348 --> 07:07.183
We weren't even
with her when she died.

07:07.251 --> 07:10.020
Do you think that
maybe why she's still here?

07:10.087 --> 07:11.921
Because she never
got a chance
to say good-bye?

07:11.989 --> 07:13.757
That might be
a part of it,

07:13.824 --> 07:16.026
But I feel like
there's some
unfinished business

07:16.093 --> 07:17.994
That she's just not
telling me about.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.398
What unfinished business
could an 11-year-old have?

07:21.465 --> 07:24.668
You know, we're here to
pick up Julia's things.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.670
The nurses said that

07:26.737 --> 07:31.207
She did a lot of drawing
and writing.

07:31.275 --> 07:32.909
Well, I guess we could
look at some of those
if you like.

07:32.977 --> 07:34.044
See if we could
find anything.

07:34.111 --> 07:35.211
That would be great.

07:35.279 --> 07:36.479
And if you find anything,

07:36.547 --> 07:38.381
Can you just call me?

07:38.449 --> 07:39.516
Thank you.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.917
Thank you.

07:44.522 --> 07:47.624
David: it will be
all right.

07:47.692 --> 07:49.959
But I can still
do magic tricks?

07:50.027 --> 07:53.596
Yeah, as long
as they're not
ghost magic tricks.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.708
Julia, what's going on?

08:04.775 --> 08:07.077
It's none
of your business.

08:07.144 --> 08:10.146
Look, I understand
that this must be
hard for you.

08:10.214 --> 08:11.681
If you just let me,
I can help you.

08:11.749 --> 08:14.117
I need Aiden,
not you.

08:14.185 --> 08:16.986
Aiden, go upstairs
and play, ok? right now.

08:17.054 --> 08:19.122
Ok. bye, Julia.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.591
Right now.

08:21.659 --> 08:23.727
I saw your mom
and dad today.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.528
They're very worried
about you.

08:25.596 --> 08:28.298
Look, I get
how confusing
it can be to--

08:28.366 --> 08:30.100
You don't get anything.
you're a grown-up.

08:30.167 --> 08:33.135
Whatever's keeping you here,
I can help you.

08:33.203 --> 08:34.404
Stop saying
you can help me.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.638
You can't.

08:35.706 --> 08:37.374
If you just
let me, I can.

08:37.441 --> 08:39.142
Jim: hey?
what's going on here?

08:39.210 --> 08:41.077
Julia's here.

08:43.780 --> 08:44.948
And, uh,

08:45.015 --> 08:46.750
Where is our son,
Aiden?

08:46.817 --> 08:49.018
He is upstairs, ok?
and he's playing
and he's fine.

08:49.086 --> 08:50.120
We're just going
to work this out.

08:50.187 --> 08:51.855
No. it's not fine.
no, we're not

08:51.922 --> 08:54.391
Going to work
this out right now.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.559
We're going to put
these knives in here,

08:56.627 --> 08:58.461
And I want Julia
out of this house.

08:58.529 --> 09:01.331
Julia, can you hear me?
I want you out of my house

09:01.399 --> 09:04.234
And I want you
to leave my son
alone, got it?

09:04.301 --> 09:05.869
Do you hear me?

09:05.936 --> 09:06.970
Jim...

09:09.206 --> 09:10.540
Does that mean
she's gone?

09:10.608 --> 09:12.175
For now.

09:12.243 --> 09:15.345
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

09:18.549 --> 09:20.483
[birds chirping]

09:20.551 --> 09:23.820
So, was Julia around
last night?

09:23.888 --> 09:26.489
No. I think she's gone.

09:26.557 --> 09:27.824
That's probably
for the best.

09:27.925 --> 09:28.925
You understand that,
right?

09:28.993 --> 09:30.226
Yeah.

09:30.294 --> 09:31.828
Is it ok to miss her?

09:31.896 --> 09:33.396
Of course it is,
sweetie.

09:33.464 --> 09:36.232
Drink your juice,
it's good for you.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.303
[gasps] oh, my god,
Aiden, don't drink that!

09:40.371 --> 09:41.771
Aiden!

09:43.474 --> 09:46.142
[gasps]

10:03.727 --> 10:06.162
Aiden?

10:13.337 --> 10:15.338
Aiden!

10:16.540 --> 10:17.474
Aiden!

10:17.541 --> 10:19.476
Jim, I can't find Aiden!
hmm?!

10:19.543 --> 10:21.511
Aiden?!

10:21.579 --> 10:23.379
Jim: I'll check
outside!

10:23.447 --> 10:25.949
Aiden!

10:26.016 --> 10:27.417
Baby!

10:27.485 --> 10:29.285
Jim: Aiden! Aiden!

10:29.353 --> 10:31.354
Aiden, where are you?!

10:38.195 --> 10:39.996
Aiden!

10:40.064 --> 10:42.165
I can't find him
anywhere.

10:42.233 --> 10:44.334
Oh, my god.

10:44.401 --> 10:46.436
Jim, I have searched
every inch of this house.

10:46.504 --> 10:48.505
Honey, honey,
calm down.
it'll be ok.

10:48.572 --> 10:50.740
I'm going to call
the police,
we'll call everyone.

10:50.808 --> 10:52.575
[breathing heavily]

10:52.643 --> 10:53.810
[dials 9-1-1]

10:53.878 --> 10:56.012
Hello?
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

10:56.080 --> 10:58.414
My son is missing!

11:08.069 --> 11:08.769
Melinda, honey.

11:08.837 --> 11:10.671
Have you heard
anything?

11:10.739 --> 11:12.740
No, nothing.
listen, I sent you
a picture.

11:12.808 --> 11:14.709
If you could just
send it to everyone you know.

11:14.776 --> 11:16.077
Ok, sure.

11:16.178 --> 11:17.812
Where's Jim?
he's, I don't know,

11:17.879 --> 11:20.081
Driving the neighborhoods,
waking up people.

11:20.148 --> 11:21.549
The police on their way,
and Eli, he went straight

11:21.616 --> 11:22.817
To detective Blair.
all right.

11:22.884 --> 11:24.151
Well, do you think
it's Julia?

11:24.219 --> 11:26.987
She took him. I know it.
the McAllister's, the Taub's,

11:27.055 --> 11:28.389
I went as far
as the playground.
nothing.

11:28.457 --> 11:29.857
She's not going to take him
somewhere we've looked.

11:29.925 --> 11:32.560
He's five. technically,
how far can he get?

11:32.627 --> 11:33.894
I mean, can a ghost even
move him like that?

11:33.962 --> 11:35.596
He'd be moving on his own.

11:35.664 --> 11:37.231
Then that means
he's in walking range.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.133
Why is he doing this?
he knows better.

11:39.201 --> 11:40.334
He probably
felt sorry for her.

11:40.402 --> 11:42.002
Or she tricked him,
I don't know.

11:42.070 --> 11:43.437
But if I have to stay
in this house for five
more minutes without him,

11:43.505 --> 11:44.638
I'm going to lose my mind.

11:44.706 --> 11:45.873
Look, I'm going
to go to main street

11:45.941 --> 11:47.675
And I'm going to go west
and south, all right?

11:47.743 --> 11:48.709
You guys go south
and east, please.

11:48.777 --> 11:50.878
I'm just gonna stay here,

11:50.946 --> 11:52.446
In case the police come
or anybody calls.

11:52.514 --> 11:53.948
I'll be here.
do you have your cell phone?

11:54.015 --> 11:55.883
Yeah, in my purse.

11:55.951 --> 11:57.918
Where are my car keys?

11:57.986 --> 11:59.253
Mel...
not now.

11:59.321 --> 12:00.821
Detective Blair
needs to ask you
some questions.

12:00.889 --> 12:02.823
Look, you have the photo
and Delia and Eli

12:02.891 --> 12:04.225
Will catch you up
on everything.

12:04.292 --> 12:05.526
Right now,
nothing else matters.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.861
All right, well,
the police are
already canvassing,

12:06.928 --> 12:08.329
But there are details
I need to hear from you,

12:08.396 --> 12:09.764
Specifics that could help us
find your child.

12:09.831 --> 12:11.565
He's with a dead little girl
who doesn't care

12:11.633 --> 12:14.235
Whether he lives or dies.

12:14.302 --> 12:16.570
Does that help you?

12:16.638 --> 12:18.339
A dead girl?

12:18.406 --> 12:20.141
A ghost.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.942
Throughout the years,
the cases we've
helped you with,

12:22.010 --> 12:23.911
The bodies we've found,

12:23.979 --> 12:26.814
It's because Melinda
can see spirits
and I can, well--

12:26.882 --> 12:29.784
It's just a lot
to explain.

12:29.851 --> 12:31.652
Ok.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.120
Ok.

12:33.188 --> 12:35.256
Just give me a chance
to filter the right
information

12:35.323 --> 12:37.158
To my officers.

12:53.241 --> 12:54.408
It's a surprise.

12:54.476 --> 12:55.810
It's going to be fun.

I'm not supposed
to go anywhere but

the things I'm going
to show you,

They'll understand.

I don't know.

I know some
really good magic.

even know about.

13:12.294 --> 13:14.395
Ok, come on.
you have to get on.

13:15.764 --> 13:17.565
Does it cost money?

13:18.867 --> 13:20.201
See that mom and those kids?

13:20.268 --> 13:22.336
Go with them,
but stay right behind them.

13:22.404 --> 13:23.637

They checked the grounds
and surrounding areas.

14:23.098 --> 14:24.465
He's on a bus.

14:24.532 --> 14:27.401

With red stripes.

a logo or a number.

Where did you see--

14:30.639 --> 14:33.407
Please, don't ask me
how I know that.

14:33.475 --> 14:35.142
I was going to ask you
where the bus was going.

14:35.210 --> 14:36.377
If you saw where
it was headed.

14:36.444 --> 14:37.745
Any direction,
any landmarks.

14:37.812 --> 14:39.213
No.

It's ok, honey,
you're here.

15:02.237 --> 15:04.171
Did you hear anything?
no.

15:04.239 --> 15:05.372
Well, there's
a couple outside

15:05.440 --> 15:06.640
That are looking
to talk to Melinda.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.676
She just left.

15:08.743 --> 15:12.546
Well, then I think maybe
we should talk to them.

15:15.583 --> 15:16.717
Eli: are those Julia's
things from the hospital?

15:16.785 --> 15:17.785
Yeah, we--
ahh.

15:17.852 --> 15:21.055
Julia did a lot of
writing and drawing

15:21.122 --> 15:24.625
To keep herself
company.

15:24.693 --> 15:25.626

What you found.

her thoughts and...

15:38.139 --> 15:40.274
Some of them
were so dark.

15:40.342 --> 15:43.577

to a friend of hers.

for over two hours now.

You have to tell us
what your daughter did.

15:57.525 --> 16:00.361
She was so lonely.
she made things up.

16:00.428 --> 16:01.695
Please. we need to know.

16:01.763 --> 16:04.331
Um, she, uh,

16:04.399 --> 16:07.334
She talks about this
one friend.

16:07.402 --> 16:10.504
It was a girl.
she didn't say who,

16:10.572 --> 16:13.540
But Julia seems
to think that,

she killed her.

this is woodland avenue.

Where are we?

17:07.028 --> 17:08.262
We'll just take
a shortcut.

a secret or something?
yes.

to show you something.

about Melinda's son?

I don't know where he is.

18:16.961 --> 18:19.630
I just know that
you're barking up
the wrong tree.

How?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.368
I've spent some time
at that hospital.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.969
Your mother.
you visit her every day.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.938

a few things.

That girl, the ghost...

She's not what
you're up against.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.514
I don't understand.
she didn't take Aiden?

18:37.582 --> 18:40.184
She did, but only
because she's scared.

18:40.251 --> 18:41.585
She's a scared little girl.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.988
She's watched too many
of her friends waste away.

18:45.056 --> 18:46.223
And after they died,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.726
Something she had to watch
even worse.

18:48.793 --> 18:50.361
Worse how?

18:50.428 --> 18:51.662
Eli, I warned you.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.331
I warned you to stay
out of their business.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.133
Who? the shadows?

18:56.201 --> 18:57.835
What's all this
really about?
I don't understand.

18:57.902 --> 18:59.203
The shadows
get you installed

18:59.270 --> 19:00.371
As the university
president,

19:00.438 --> 19:01.939
And they're responsible
for this dead girl

19:02.006 --> 19:03.107
Somehow?

19:03.174 --> 19:05.008
Melinda was warned
to leave Julia alone.

19:05.076 --> 19:06.343
She should listen.

19:06.411 --> 19:07.778
What, the message
in her kitchen?

19:07.846 --> 19:10.280
She tried to get
that girl to cross over
into the light.

19:10.348 --> 19:11.448
Is that a bad thing?
what do the shadows

19:11.516 --> 19:12.483
Have against
going into the light?

19:12.550 --> 19:14.685
I'm taking a huge risk
just being here.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.020
Hold on!
are you saying
the shadows

19:17.088 --> 19:18.355
Had something to do with
what happened to Aiden?

19:18.423 --> 19:20.157
All I'm saying
is if you and Melinda

19:20.225 --> 19:22.126
Aren't careful,
they will.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.495
They will.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.669
If I'd have known
he was on his own,

19:32.737 --> 19:34.104
I wouldn't let him
get on the bus.

19:34.172 --> 19:35.672
Who did he get on with?

19:35.740 --> 19:37.074
I saw him get on
with his family.

19:37.142 --> 19:38.909
No, look,
I'm his family,
all right?

19:38.977 --> 19:41.278
I'm his father.
this is my son.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.347
See? you sure this is
the boy you saw?

19:43.415 --> 19:44.615
Yeah, that's him.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.450
I already
told the police.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.853
Look, if it's
any consolation,
he seemed ok.

19:49.921 --> 19:50.854
Thanks.

19:50.922 --> 19:52.689
Except...
except what?

19:52.757 --> 19:55.759
Well, at one point,
I noticed the seat
next to him was empty.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.127
But he was talking.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.328
To himself, I guess.

19:58.396 --> 19:59.897
To be honest,
that's the only reason

19:59.964 --> 20:01.198
I gave him
a second though.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.400
But then, I've got
to keep my eyes
on the road.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.203
Do you remember
where he got off?
did you notice?

20:06.271 --> 20:07.838
I'm pretty sure it was
along woodland avenue,

20:07.906 --> 20:09.173
The stop by
the highway.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.474
By the on-ramp?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.476
The stop's a way
from the entrance.
yeah.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.644
There's not much else
there--another bus stop,

20:13.711 --> 20:14.978
Some woods.

20:15.046 --> 20:16.313
Oh, man. thanks.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.649
Look, mister...

20:18.716 --> 20:20.417
I'm sorry.

20:20.485 --> 20:23.821
Don't be.
I'll find him.

20:23.888 --> 20:26.423
Delia: have you
found anything?

20:26.491 --> 20:29.593
Just kid's stuff.
a lot of poems about

20:29.661 --> 20:31.562
Being alone, sick, angry.

20:31.629 --> 20:32.863
She hated IVs.

20:32.931 --> 20:33.897
And some of the nurses.

20:33.965 --> 20:35.299
And all of her medicine.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.305
How are we supposed
to do this?

20:41.372 --> 20:43.707
Bit by bit,
until we find out
what's keeping her here.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.576
What's keeping her here
is that she was a bad kid

20:45.643 --> 20:48.145
Who hung out
with bad ghosts.

20:48.213 --> 20:49.780
I mean, right here
it says that sally stitch

20:49.848 --> 20:52.649
Was a real ghost
and that Julia did
everything she asked.

20:52.717 --> 20:53.817
And Bedford said
this girl

20:53.885 --> 20:54.952
Isn't the one we should
be worrying about.

20:55.019 --> 20:56.386
Why are you taking
his word for anything?

20:56.454 --> 20:58.689
I mean, look at this.

20:58.756 --> 21:00.424
Julia goes on and on
about killing a friend.

21:00.492 --> 21:04.294
And this whole journal
is full of the words
"it's my fault."

21:04.362 --> 21:06.663
I mean, you tell me.
how do you get

21:06.731 --> 21:10.100
A child sociopath
to let go of Aiden
and go into the light?

21:10.168 --> 21:12.769
Sociopaths
don't feel guilt.

21:12.837 --> 21:14.605
Delia: yeah,
they don't have
friends, either.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.874
Have you really
looked at these books?

21:16.941 --> 21:19.176
It seems that
many of them

21:19.244 --> 21:21.678
Belong to a girl
named lily.

21:21.746 --> 21:24.815
I saw that name
somewhere else.

21:26.684 --> 21:27.818
Here it is.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.586
This weird food list.

21:29.654 --> 21:30.787
Let me see it.

21:30.855 --> 21:33.190
Like some kind of haiku poem.

21:33.258 --> 21:36.193
This isn't a list.

21:36.261 --> 21:38.395
This is a diet.
for lily.

21:41.199 --> 21:44.835
Ned: "Tuesday, ketchup.
Wednesday, bacon."

21:44.903 --> 21:46.136
Bacon and one lemon.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.472
That's it?
for the whole day?

21:48.540 --> 21:51.708
"Thursday, cure berries
from the magic bush

21:51.776 --> 21:53.510
By the dolphin
fountain."

21:53.578 --> 21:55.012
That fountain's in
the back of the hospital

21:55.079 --> 21:56.647
In the garden.
there's some bushes
back there,

21:56.714 --> 21:58.649
But I doubt they're edible.

21:59.851 --> 22:01.652
Cure berries.

22:03.688 --> 22:06.590
Don't you see?

22:08.459 --> 22:10.294
[cell phone rings]
Hello.

22:10.361 --> 22:12.462
Delia: Mel,
I don't know if you
want to hear this.

22:12.530 --> 22:15.098
But maybe, just maybe
Julia Miller

22:15.166 --> 22:16.633
Isn't as bad
as we thought.

22:16.701 --> 22:17.901
Melinda: I would love
to hear that.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.337
It's possible she killed
her friend by mistake.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.973
By doing something
the shadows
asked her to do?

22:23.041 --> 22:25.309
By making some kind
of potion to cure her friend

22:25.376 --> 22:26.977
Out of bacons, lemons, and--

22:27.045 --> 22:28.211
It's not important.

22:28.279 --> 22:29.846
What's important is,
I think she might have

22:29.914 --> 22:31.548
Picked the berries
that have killed
her friend.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.717
Didn't you once
have a nightmare

22:33.785 --> 22:35.218
Where you nearly
poisoned Aiden?

22:35.286 --> 22:36.520
I had a vision.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.121
I could see a girl.

22:38.189 --> 22:39.523
I don't know
if it was Julia
or her friend,

22:39.591 --> 22:41.291
But they had
gotten sick.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.826
Eli: Bedford
said something
about Julia

22:42.894 --> 22:45.395
Having a bunch of friends
at the hospital

22:45.463 --> 22:46.730
Like, waste away.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.266
Maybe she tried
to do something about it.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.368
I hope you're right.

22:57.241 --> 22:59.576
Aiden: how long
do I have to wear this?

22:59.644 --> 23:01.745
Julia: not much longer.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.981
Are we getting close?

23:04.048 --> 23:06.183
Just keep going straight.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.318
The ground's pretty flat.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.988
We're almost there.

23:29.707 --> 23:32.075
You can take off
your blindfold now.

23:39.550 --> 23:42.252
I don't know
this place.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.754
Are we at
the train station?

23:43.821 --> 23:45.055
Sort of.

23:45.123 --> 23:46.590
Is this a surprise?

23:46.658 --> 23:48.025
Yeah.

23:48.092 --> 23:51.194
Why did I have
to cover my eyes?

23:51.262 --> 23:53.030
I, uh,

23:53.097 --> 23:55.999
Just thought
it'd be more fun.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.802
I'm hungry.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.271
I guess you don't
have any snacks.

24:01.339 --> 24:03.874
Why isn't there
anyone here?

24:03.941 --> 24:06.309
I thought there'd be
kids here.

24:06.377 --> 24:08.979
Kids love
this place.

24:09.047 --> 24:12.482
It's happy.

24:12.550 --> 24:13.650
Safe.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.519
It's getting dark.

24:15.586 --> 24:17.754
I want to go home.

24:17.822 --> 24:19.356
We can't.

24:19.424 --> 24:20.524
I can't.

24:20.591 --> 24:22.492
We can find a grown-up
and call my mom.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.727
She'll send me away.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.828
Just to the light.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.196
You'll like it.
it's nice.

24:26.264 --> 24:27.798
You don't know that.

24:27.865 --> 24:29.366
You don't know anything,

24:29.434 --> 24:31.668
And neither does she.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.136
[rumbling]

24:33.204 --> 24:37.741
Why is your voice
sounding mean?

24:37.809 --> 24:39.309
I--I can't go home,

24:39.377 --> 24:41.211
And I can't
go into the light.

24:41.279 --> 24:43.580
If I do,
they'll get hurt.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.382
Who?

24:45.450 --> 24:48.085
All the spirits
that were nice to me.

24:48.152 --> 24:49.419
The good ones.

24:49.487 --> 24:50.620
Ghosts don't get hurt.

24:50.688 --> 24:52.122
My mom says
they can't feel pain.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.523
She's wrong.

24:53.591 --> 24:54.524
We do.

24:54.592 --> 24:56.560
How?

24:56.627 --> 25:00.363
It's an uh-oh feeling.
you know, like when

25:00.431 --> 25:01.732
You've done
something wrong.

25:01.799 --> 25:03.867
It's all you can
think about.

25:03.935 --> 25:06.803
The bad thing you did.

25:06.871 --> 25:08.972
All of the bad things
you did.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.675
And it grows
and grows until
that's all you are.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.777
You're nothing else.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.347
It eats you up
completely.

25:18.983 --> 25:21.752
It's coming for me.

25:21.819 --> 25:24.020
I know it.

25:58.371 --> 26:00.873
This is it,
this is it. Aiden!

26:00.940 --> 26:02.908
Aiden, can you hear me?

26:02.976 --> 26:04.109
Aiden!

26:04.177 --> 26:05.544
The bus driver
said it was this stop.

26:05.612 --> 26:07.012
Aiden!

26:07.080 --> 26:09.581
Aiden, no matter what
Julia said,

26:09.649 --> 26:11.183
It's not all right to hide.

26:11.251 --> 26:14.153
Aiden, if you can
hear my voice...

26:15.288 --> 26:16.388
Damn it.

26:21.828 --> 26:23.595
What the hell
is that?

26:31.871 --> 26:33.272
Aiden?!

26:33.339 --> 26:34.740
Aiden!

26:34.808 --> 26:37.042
Aiden, I know
this is yours! Aiden!

26:38.645 --> 26:40.846
[cell phone rings]
Jim?

26:40.914 --> 26:43.849
Hey! did you find him?
Jim: no.

26:43.917 --> 26:46.218
No, but he was here.
he was here by this bus stop.

26:46.286 --> 26:47.853
Look, I just found
a little silver car

26:47.921 --> 26:49.088
That he must have
just dropped.

26:49.155 --> 26:50.989
I called the police.

26:51.057 --> 26:52.324
Are you sure
it's his?

26:52.392 --> 26:54.460
Yeah. because...

26:54.527 --> 26:56.261
It's got the little
scratch on it

26:56.329 --> 26:58.030
Where I showed him how
to use the sliding board
for a jump.

26:58.098 --> 27:02.234
Honey, when we find him,
I swear...

27:02.302 --> 27:03.502
I know.

27:03.570 --> 27:06.205
You're never going
to leave the house again.

27:06.272 --> 27:07.906
Where did you find
the toy?

27:07.974 --> 27:09.374
Just at the edge
of the woods.

27:09.442 --> 27:10.609
He must have been
playing with it

27:10.677 --> 27:11.910
On the bus when
he dropped it.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.412
She probably led him
into the woods.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.547
You know, to keep him
out of sight.

27:15.615 --> 27:16.715
All right,
I'm going in there.

27:16.783 --> 27:18.550
Ok, well, just call me
if you see anything.

27:18.618 --> 27:20.686
You know it.
I love you.

27:20.753 --> 27:22.488
I love you, too.

27:34.601 --> 27:36.869
What do the shadows
want with my son?

27:36.936 --> 27:37.970
Carl: I don't know.

27:38.037 --> 27:39.204
I don't
have time, Carl!

27:39.272 --> 27:40.472
I'm aware of that, Melinda.

27:40.540 --> 27:42.241
No, Bedford
just told Eli

27:42.308 --> 27:43.842
That they
threatened my son

27:43.910 --> 27:45.711
If I crossed Julia
over into the light,

27:45.778 --> 27:47.212
Which means they were
the ones who moved
that furniture.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.447
What I don't
know is why.

27:48.515 --> 27:49.615
I don't know, either,
Melinda.

27:49.682 --> 27:50.949
How can you
not know?

27:51.017 --> 27:52.251
What the hell
are you seeing, Carl,

27:52.318 --> 27:53.318
When you're doing
all this watching?

27:53.386 --> 27:55.787
Not the shadows.
I told you that.

27:55.855 --> 27:57.956
Ghosts can't see
the shadows.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.859
No one I know sees them,
except...

28:00.927 --> 28:01.860
Aiden.

28:01.928 --> 28:03.428
He sees those others.

28:03.496 --> 28:04.530
The shinies.

28:04.597 --> 28:06.598
And if those beings,
whatever they are,

28:06.666 --> 28:09.635
Fear the shadows,
I'm guessing--

28:09.702 --> 28:12.905
Guessing they co-exist
on the same plane.

28:12.972 --> 28:16.175
Really? Carl, that's
the best you can do?

28:18.545 --> 28:20.712
[exhales]
we hear rumors.

28:20.780 --> 28:22.414
We hear whispers.

28:22.482 --> 28:23.682
What?

28:23.783 --> 28:26.685
Whatever they are,
wherever they live,

28:26.753 --> 28:28.887
These shadows
are very interested

28:28.955 --> 28:30.489
In children, Melinda.

28:30.557 --> 28:32.691
Especially ghost children.

28:32.759 --> 28:34.293
Why?

28:34.360 --> 28:37.462
No one seems to know.

28:37.530 --> 28:39.831
Are you telling me

28:39.899 --> 28:43.101
That the shadows
want to turn my son
into a ghost?

28:44.337 --> 28:47.706
I told you,
I don't know.

28:50.944 --> 28:52.778
Then at least tell me,

28:52.845 --> 28:54.379
Do you have some idea
where he went?

28:54.447 --> 28:58.116
I can't--I can't.
he's hidden from me.
how?

28:58.184 --> 29:00.886
I can't see clearly.
my vision,

29:00.954 --> 29:04.556
It's filled with pictures
from my past.

29:04.624 --> 29:08.594
Everywhere I look,
it's like an endless
slide show

29:08.661 --> 29:10.529
Of every mistake
I made in my life.

29:10.597 --> 29:12.297
It's like a sickness of guilt.

29:12.365 --> 29:14.266
Is that why
you seem so weak?

29:15.868 --> 29:17.736
Oh.

29:17.804 --> 29:19.972
It's the shadows.

29:20.039 --> 29:21.907
If that's true...

29:21.975 --> 29:24.643
Do everything you can,
Melinda,

29:24.711 --> 29:25.811
Not to anger them.

29:25.878 --> 29:28.180
I will do anything
to get my son back.

29:28.248 --> 29:29.581
Just don't anger them.

29:29.649 --> 29:32.818
I will do anything.

to detective Blair.

29:37.190 --> 29:38.690
She's going to send
a search party
up to these woods.

29:38.758 --> 29:39.958
Ok, well,
did you find anything?

29:40.026 --> 29:41.727
It's weird.
I found a little
yellow school bus,

29:41.794 --> 29:43.128
And I'm pretty sure
that it's Aiden's.

29:43.196 --> 29:45.430
[sighs]
something else shiny.

29:45.498 --> 29:46.565
What are you getting at?

29:46.633 --> 29:48.667
Last night,
in the kitchen, um,

29:48.735 --> 29:49.868
Everything was shiny.

29:49.936 --> 29:51.370
You know, remember?

29:51.437 --> 29:54.139
Remember, Aiden said
that the shadows
and the shinies,

29:54.207 --> 29:55.641
That they hate each other?

29:55.708 --> 29:57.743
Well, what if Julia
put all that stuff
out there because

29:57.810 --> 29:59.177
She was trying
to keep the shadows away

29:59.245 --> 30:00.512
And attract the shinies?

30:00.580 --> 30:01.647
Wait, do you think
that's why

30:01.714 --> 30:03.482
They brought
these toys with them?

30:03.549 --> 30:05.117
I don't know,
maybe. Carl--

30:06.252 --> 30:07.619
Carl?

30:09.389 --> 30:11.323
Wait a minute. oh!

30:11.391 --> 30:12.924
Melinda,
I found another one.

30:12.992 --> 30:14.293
It's a little
tiny train.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.728
He's not dropping
that stuff on accident.

30:16.796 --> 30:18.563
So what do you think,
he's leaving a trail
of bread crumbs?

30:18.631 --> 30:19.731
He's trying to tell us
something.

30:19.799 --> 30:21.466
The car, the bus,
the train--

30:21.534 --> 30:22.668
It all has
to do with travel.

30:22.735 --> 30:24.169
Wait a minute,
travel town.

30:24.237 --> 30:26.104
Remember that place?
it's nearby here.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.873
But it shut down
a couple years ago.

30:27.940 --> 30:29.841
The ghost
wouldn't know that.

30:29.909 --> 30:31.310

30:31.377 --> 30:34.212
It is right
where I'm headed.

don't leave me!

It's travel town.

31:01.808 --> 31:04.276
I used to come here
with my parents.

31:04.344 --> 31:06.411
Why didn't you
tell me that?

31:06.479 --> 31:09.414
I didn't want you to know,
or your mom would find out.

31:09.482 --> 31:10.549
How would my mom
find out?

31:10.616 --> 31:13.051
She never told you?

31:13.119 --> 31:14.653
She can see
what you can see.

31:14.721 --> 31:17.789
It's like
she's spying on you.

31:17.857 --> 31:18.890
I've watched her.

31:18.958 --> 31:20.392
She can see it all.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.461
[crickets chirping]

31:24.464 --> 31:26.365
Where you going?

31:26.432 --> 31:28.533
There's a light
over there.

31:40.613 --> 31:43.215
Aiden: hello?

31:43.282 --> 31:44.616
Hello?

31:46.185 --> 31:48.186
I don't
like it here.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.021
I want to go
some place safe.

31:50.089 --> 31:52.491
My mom says
ghosts are safe
in the light.

31:52.558 --> 31:54.693
You should go in the light.

31:54.761 --> 31:55.794
You sill trust her?

31:55.862 --> 31:58.430
After she lied to you?

31:58.498 --> 32:01.400
Just look around
and see if you can
find the light.

32:01.467 --> 32:04.403
It's too dark
in here.

32:09.909 --> 32:12.477
I can feel them.

32:12.545 --> 32:15.280
They're here.

32:22.889 --> 32:24.256
Stay close to me.

32:24.323 --> 32:26.425
Aiden!

32:26.492 --> 32:27.459
I'm scared.

32:27.527 --> 32:30.462
I'm scared,
I'm scared!

32:30.530 --> 32:33.398
I can't see them!
where are they?

32:33.466 --> 32:35.801
Close your eyes.

32:35.868 --> 32:38.570
I'm scared,
I'm scared!

32:38.638 --> 32:40.238
[crying]

32:40.306 --> 32:41.373
Keep your eyes
closed.

32:49.849 --> 32:51.817
What's happening to me?!

32:57.690 --> 33:00.025
I can still see
everything!

33:00.092 --> 33:01.493
All the bad stuff.

33:07.733 --> 33:11.470
All the bad stuff
I've ever done!

33:11.537 --> 33:13.472
It's everywhere I look!

33:15.908 --> 33:18.910
It's everywhere.

33:18.978 --> 33:20.011
I hate you
for putting me here!

33:20.079 --> 33:22.447
I just want to die!

33:22.515 --> 33:24.983
No!

33:25.051 --> 33:26.885
Aiden: no! please, no!

33:27.953 --> 33:29.654
It eats you up completely.

33:30.656 --> 33:33.725
No! stop!

33:42.909 --> 33:44.477
Aiden, get out.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.147
And your backpack, quick!

33:48.050 --> 33:49.985
Hurry, Aiden, hurry!

34:14.206 --> 34:16.108
Where are you?

34:16.176 --> 34:19.344
Come on!

34:20.112 --> 34:21.414
Julia:
what's happening?!

34:21.481 --> 34:22.547
Aiden:
the shinies...

34:22.616 --> 34:24.617
They won't come in.
they're too scared.

34:24.685 --> 34:27.920
The other shadows
are keeping them out!

34:27.987 --> 34:30.822
I need help!

34:35.329 --> 34:37.295
[shadows shrieking]

35:00.187 --> 35:02.822
[shrieking continues]

35:21.074 --> 35:23.075
[brakes squealing]

35:32.486 --> 35:33.853
Aiden: are you ok?

35:33.920 --> 35:36.989
It was so awful!

35:44.898 --> 35:46.999
Melinda: Aiden?
Aiden!

35:47.067 --> 35:49.301
Jim: Mel!

35:49.369 --> 35:50.836
Aiden!
[siren]

35:50.904 --> 35:52.204
Mom, dad!
[tires squealing]

35:53.540 --> 35:55.074
Oh, my god!

35:56.376 --> 35:58.477
My baby!
Aiden, are you all right?

35:58.545 --> 36:00.045
Oh, little buddy!
we're so happy to see you!

36:00.113 --> 36:02.014
Oh! honey!

36:02.082 --> 36:03.349
Are you ok?!

36:03.417 --> 36:04.750
Oh, you really
scared me, man.

36:04.818 --> 36:05.918
You really had us scared.

36:05.986 --> 36:07.486
I know. me, too.

36:07.587 --> 36:09.488
Come here.

36:09.556 --> 36:12.925
Oh, what were you thinking,
you crazy kid?

36:12.993 --> 36:15.027
Cop: is he ok?

36:15.095 --> 36:31.076
Jim: hey, officer.
yeah, we got him,
he's ok.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.714
Melinda: it's safe
to come out now.

36:35.782 --> 36:37.583
Are you sure?

36:37.651 --> 36:39.885
Aiden says
there's no shadows.

36:39.953 --> 36:42.955
And there's some people
that you need to see.

36:51.431 --> 36:52.932
It's ok.

36:58.338 --> 36:59.705
Mom and dad?

36:59.773 --> 37:01.240
Linda: is she here?

37:04.010 --> 37:05.544
They came to say
good-bye.

37:05.612 --> 37:07.546
It's time
for you to go
into the light.

37:07.614 --> 37:09.048
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

37:09.115 --> 37:10.983
Because you were
told that something
bad would happen

37:11.051 --> 37:12.618
To your ghost
friends if you did.

37:12.686 --> 37:14.954
Did Aiden tell you that?

37:15.021 --> 37:17.223
He was worried
about you.

37:17.290 --> 37:19.291
He saw what happened to me.
I know.

37:19.359 --> 37:21.093
But I'm going
to make sure that
your friends are ok.

37:21.161 --> 37:22.127
How?

37:22.195 --> 37:24.396
By getting some help
from my friends.

37:24.464 --> 37:26.432
I want you
to meet them.

37:29.503 --> 37:30.936
Julia: what will you do?

37:31.004 --> 37:33.272
Well, we have
some things
the shadows don't.

37:33.306 --> 37:34.573
We have a book,

37:34.641 --> 37:37.309
And we have lots
of ghost friends
of our own.

37:37.377 --> 37:38.744
We'll find a way.

37:38.812 --> 37:41.013
But right now,
we need to get you
into the light.

37:41.081 --> 37:44.416
Julia, hi. my name's Ned.

37:44.484 --> 37:45.818
I hope you don't mind,

37:45.886 --> 37:47.920
But we read some
of the things you wrote
in the hospital,

37:47.988 --> 37:48.921
About lily.

37:48.989 --> 37:50.656
Eli: and we pieced
everything together.

37:50.724 --> 37:52.091
And we want you
to understand--

37:52.158 --> 37:53.826
You didn't
hurt your friend.

37:53.894 --> 37:57.563
Jim: Julia, when
you were in the hospital

37:57.631 --> 37:59.298
And you made those potions,

37:59.366 --> 38:01.800
You weren't just
playing doctor.

38:01.868 --> 38:04.236
You were trying
to make a real cure
for your friend lily.

38:04.304 --> 38:06.672
I mean, something
the regular doctors
couldn't do.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.173
But I didn't help her.

38:08.241 --> 38:10.876
I made her more sick,
and then she died.

38:10.944 --> 38:13.846
She thinks
that she made her
more sick,

38:13.914 --> 38:15.314
And that's why
she died.

38:15.382 --> 38:17.349
Oh, that's not true, honey.

38:17.417 --> 38:19.318
You only think that
because she went
into the hospital

38:19.386 --> 38:21.253
After you gave her
your potion.

38:21.321 --> 38:23.656
But she was sicker
than you knew,

38:23.723 --> 38:24.790
A lot sicker.

38:24.858 --> 38:26.125
What do you mean?

38:26.192 --> 38:27.893
She doesn't
understand.

38:27.961 --> 38:30.296
Uh...

38:30.363 --> 38:32.531
Lily had the same thing
you had, darling.

38:32.599 --> 38:34.333
Lily had leukemia.

38:34.401 --> 38:36.335
But you told me
she had a bug.

38:36.403 --> 38:38.871
She remembers you
calling lily's
disease just a bug.

38:38.939 --> 38:40.773
Darling, we--

38:40.840 --> 38:43.742
We didn't know
that you'd given her
that potion.

38:43.777 --> 38:47.046
We didn't realize
that you'd thought
you'd made her more sick.

38:47.113 --> 38:49.415
But why didn't you tell me
she had leukemia?

38:49.482 --> 38:52.585
She just wishes you could
have told her the truth
about lily's disease.

38:52.652 --> 38:54.286
Oh, baby.

38:54.354 --> 38:56.622
We were afraid
that you would think

38:56.690 --> 38:58.390
You might die
like she did.

38:58.458 --> 39:00.392
But I did.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.494
But she did.

39:02.562 --> 39:04.396
Yeah.

39:04.464 --> 39:06.565
Not for years.

39:06.633 --> 39:11.070
In all that time,
you had hope.

39:11.137 --> 39:12.605
I thought lily had hope, too.

39:12.672 --> 39:14.573
I thought I gave it to her.

39:14.641 --> 39:16.976
She feels guilty.

39:17.043 --> 39:18.043
She feels like
she gave lily

39:18.111 --> 39:20.346
A false sense of hope.

39:20.447 --> 39:23.115
Don't you know,
sweetheart?

39:23.183 --> 39:26.085
You gave her something
better than hope.

39:26.152 --> 39:28.954
You gave her a friend.

39:29.022 --> 39:30.389
Lily's parents told us

39:30.457 --> 39:32.224
That those last months
you spent together,

39:32.292 --> 39:35.728
Those were
the happiest times
she ever had.

39:42.002 --> 39:45.004
She sees it.

39:45.071 --> 39:46.639
She sees the light.

39:49.776 --> 39:53.278
I'm afraid something bad
will happen to my friends.

39:53.346 --> 39:55.280
Julia,
look into the light.

39:55.348 --> 39:56.782
Try really hard.

39:56.850 --> 39:58.584
You might see
some of your friends.

39:58.652 --> 40:00.853
Once you've crossed over.
Aiden: really look.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.088
You can make them
appear.

40:03.156 --> 40:05.024
Just like magic.

40:05.091 --> 40:06.859
[chuckles]

40:06.926 --> 40:09.662
There she is.

40:09.763 --> 40:11.030
I see lily.

40:11.097 --> 40:14.033
She's smiling at me.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.068
Lily's there.

40:18.038 --> 40:19.805
Go in, darling.

40:21.508 --> 40:23.842
Wait for us.

40:23.910 --> 40:26.045
We'll be there soon.

40:29.015 --> 40:30.916
Bye, mommy.

40:30.984 --> 40:33.052
Bye, daddy.

40:41.761 --> 40:44.496
?seasons change ?

40:44.564 --> 40:48.434
?treetops sway ?

40:48.501 --> 40:49.635
She's gone.

40:49.703 --> 40:52.571
?I am young today ?
[both sobbing]

40:54.774 --> 40:57.943
?children play ?

40:58.011 --> 41:01.647
?sidewalk games ?

41:01.715 --> 41:04.516
?as I dream ?

41:04.584 --> 41:08.120
?away ?

41:08.188 --> 41:10.589
?that someday
I'll float away ?

41:10.657 --> 41:12.624
Ok, now remember--
anyone, person

41:12.691 --> 41:13.892
Or a ghost tries
to tell you
to do something

41:13.959 --> 41:15.860
That you know
is wrong...

41:15.928 --> 41:17.095
I know, mommy.

41:17.162 --> 41:18.963
I won't.

41:19.031 --> 41:21.132
It's important, Aiden.
I know.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.067
I'm sorry I scared you guys.

41:23.135 --> 41:24.636
You really did.

41:24.703 --> 41:27.372
But we're proud
of you for wanting
to help someone.

41:27.439 --> 41:29.874
Just remember
that most of the time

41:29.942 --> 41:31.876
Helping somebody is not
a little person's job.

41:31.944 --> 41:34.045
It's a big person's
job, ok?

41:34.113 --> 41:36.414
I get it.
all right.

41:36.482 --> 41:38.316
Can I have my backpack?

41:40.953 --> 41:42.620
There you go.

41:46.258 --> 41:49.827
Percy. I didn't know
she packed Percy.

41:49.895 --> 41:52.297
Who did? Julia?

41:52.364 --> 41:53.665
But wait a minute--

41:53.732 --> 41:55.333
Julia didn't want us
to find you, so...

41:55.401 --> 41:57.669
If you didn't
pack your backpack,

41:57.736 --> 42:02.173
Who packed the toys
that left the trail
for us to find?

42:02.241 --> 42:04.542
The shinies.

42:04.610 --> 42:05.810
They led us to him.

42:05.878 --> 42:07.812
They--they knew you were
going to be in travel town.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.814
They had to.

42:09.882 --> 42:11.716
Because Julia
blindfolded me.

42:11.784 --> 42:14.252
So they couldn't see
the stuff I saw.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.987
Like usual.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.689
What do you mean?

42:17.756 --> 42:19.490
Julia told me the truth.

42:19.558 --> 42:22.026
That you can see
everything I see.

42:22.094 --> 42:23.895
Melinda: not everything.

42:23.963 --> 42:26.397
Just some things?
which ones?

42:26.465 --> 42:28.499
I don't really
know how it works, baby.

42:28.567 --> 42:30.635
I--I think it's just
the things I need to see.

42:30.703 --> 42:32.470
But you said no secrets.

42:32.538 --> 42:33.838
Why'd you
keep them from me?

42:33.906 --> 42:37.041
I hated doing that.
I really did.

42:37.109 --> 42:39.043
It's just,
sometimes moms and dads,

42:39.111 --> 42:41.446
They--they have
to keep secrets.

42:41.513 --> 42:44.315
You know, to make
the world feel
a little bit safer.

42:44.383 --> 42:46.250
But it isn't.

42:46.318 --> 42:49.187
Jim: hey, Aiden,
mostly it's safe.

42:49.254 --> 42:50.888
Really. it's just,

42:50.956 --> 42:52.357
There are some
places that--

42:52.424 --> 42:53.958
Like where the shadows live.

42:54.026 --> 42:55.893
Yes.

42:55.961 --> 42:58.730
Like where the shadows live,
and we shouldn't go there.

42:58.797 --> 43:00.231
Not ever.

43:00.299 --> 43:03.034
But what if we have to?

43:03.102 --> 43:05.570
I hope we won't.

43:05.637 --> 43:08.840
You don't have
to tell me.

43:08.907 --> 43:10.775
Oh, ok.
[chuckles]

43:10.843 --> 43:12.076
Come on,

43:12.144 --> 43:13.644
Scoot down.
