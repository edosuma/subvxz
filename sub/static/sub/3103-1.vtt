KINGDOM COME - BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
Translated and corrected by boogey_man

03:30.168 --> 03:32.455
What is this place?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.584
Hey. Hey.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.851
What the hell...?

04:01.283 --> 04:04.492
You've taken  it away from me.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.780
Hey, wait. I need your help.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.955
Hey, take it easy.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.753
This is impossible.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.301
What? What?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.593
There was a man in the blue suit.
Did you see him?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.641
I didn't see anyone, except you.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.268
Who are you?
- Sam.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.862
Oh god.
What is this place?

04:42.032 --> 04:45.321
I don't  know.
- You're the first person I see here.

04:45.452 --> 04:50.368
Everything is before somehow...
- Blurry?

04:51.082 --> 04:54.041
Yes.
- Yes.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.207
Did you see an exit,
stages, anything?

04:57.339 --> 05:01.253
No.
My name is Jessica.

05:01.551 --> 05:07.798
There are passages and empty rooms,
not more.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.677
Yes. I noticed.
I can't see anything.

05:11.853 --> 05:16.769
I don't know how high we are.
- What the hell was that?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.357
What did you see?

05:18.443 --> 05:21.936
I don't know.
Something has passed  in the dark.

05:26.284 --> 05:31.951
Do we run in the other direction?
- No, from there  I came .

05:32.290 --> 05:36.830
Too scary.
- Here  is  everything creepy.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.629
Are you coming?

06:47.616 --> 06:50.734
I'm sorry, otherwise I scrap in
my pants.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.405
Here.

07:14.017 --> 07:20.890
Take it easy. I won't hurt you.
And the tall man either.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.688
It's ok. What's your name?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.815
I'm Jessica.
This is Sam. What is your name?

07:31.326 --> 07:36.037
Celia.
- Celia? Ok, a nice name.

07:37.207 --> 07:41.326
Listen, Celia, do you know
how you did come here?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.872
Are you alone? Where are your parents?

07:47.425 --> 07:50.418
I woke up and was here.

07:51.388 --> 07:55.553
And do you know where that is?
Do you know where we are?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.219
In some kind of hospital.
- Listen, Celia.

07:59.354 --> 08:04.145
Did you see an exit?
Doors or open windows?

08:06.695 --> 08:08.561
I don't know.

08:13.284 --> 08:17.699
Do you take me with you?
- Yes. Yes. Of course.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.827
Is it right?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.577
Don't look like,
I were an asshole.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.502
I like kids, ok?
I  just want to get out here.

08:29.092 --> 08:34.462
Thank you, Mr. Sam.
- Welcome, Celia. And only Sam.

08:39.059 --> 08:43.429
Give me the key.
You've drunk too much.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.311
Did you have fun?
- Of course.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.567
Come on.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.197
Are you sure you can drive?
- Move in.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.489
I love you.
- And I love you.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.875
Do you have my lighter?
- Oh, here.

09:11.259 --> 09:15.970
Do you know where it is?
- Yes. Between the seats.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.259
Stop.

09:26.191 --> 09:30.526
Sarah. Sarah. Help.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.863
Help anybody.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.128
Sam. Do you feel OK?

09:57.180 --> 10:01.891
Hey. Everything ok?
- Yes. I'm fine.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.804
Despite that hormone monsters here.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.115
Hey, give me a hand, ok?
- Yes.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.703
First question:
Who are all these people?

10:29.838 --> 10:34.799
Well, this is Rachel.
- Hi.

10:35.093 --> 10:42.136
Then here are Charles, Nadir and
Victoria. And the edge is Roger.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.431
How did they all came here?
- Like you

10:45.562 --> 10:49.772
This begs the question...
- We all woke up here.

10:49.899 --> 10:53.859
Hey, you shall not interrupt me.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.523
Otherwise what?

10:56.990 --> 11:01.451
What's the matter with you two?
- Can't you shut up?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.911
The guy is an ignorant wanker.

11:04.038 --> 11:08.408
What do you do?
Giving me a shoot?

11:08.543 --> 11:14.289
Gang members don't scare me.
- I'm not one, you cocksucker.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.839
Hey.
- People, enough, honestly.

11:21.806 --> 11:26.141
How long I was flashed out?
- About 20 minutes or so.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.857
Celia. Come here.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.071
Can we find  a way out of here please?

11:39.199 --> 11:45.491
How did we come here, actually?
Do anybody remember on something?

11:46.497 --> 11:51.993
Well, I was just on the way to a
club, with my best friend.

11:52.086 --> 11:56.376
That's it. On more
I don't remember.

11:56.507 --> 12:02.754
I woke up in here with headaches .
- My back hurts. And my feet.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.010
After that I can almost remember on nothing.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.852
Maybe we were stunned.
- Ridiculous.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.471
Hey, shut up, simply, yeah?

12:12.565 --> 12:16.605
If you have nothing useful to say,
than be quite.

12:16.736 --> 12:22.653
Who should stun us and bring in here?
Any ideas?

12:27.872 --> 12:32.537
What do you remember on?
- I went to work straigh away, I think.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.581
I am a nurse.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.876
After that, everything was a mess,
I don't know.

12:38.007 --> 12:42.752
But someone must have seen something,
that tells us where we are.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.214
Does anyone have a cell phone?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.056
Dead.
- Mine too.

12:51.479 --> 12:56.349
Yes, on the sisterstation were none too,
what strange is

12:56.567 --> 13:01.062
Wait, I think I have something.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.792
What the hell did you do to
my phone?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.875
Everything ok?

13:24.220 --> 13:28.339
Ok, we should split up and search
for an exit.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.308
No, we should stay together.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.600
Maybe together we can open a window.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.269
Where are you going?
- Am going to toilett.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.063
I have to pee.
Is that ok for you?

13:40.194 --> 13:43.437
I saw one in the corridor.
- Yes. I'll  find that.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.283
Probably it is no so smart,
to go alone.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.527
Well, I don't like accompaniment,

13:49.662 --> 13:53.281
and I didn't need
ever a man  as a watchdog.

13:54.208 --> 13:59.249
Hey. Why don't you go with her?
- Fuck it. You've heard her.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.836
What is wrong with these people?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.697
People?

16:01.752 --> 16:05.086
Come on, people. This is...

17:01.896 --> 17:04.888
This won't work.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.375
Have an eye on her.

18:01.872 --> 18:06.367
Victoria? Are you in there?
Everything ok?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.955
Maybe she's somewhere else.

18:12.091 --> 18:16.051
Maybe she is
scared or lost.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.384
That didn't sounds
like she has walked wrong, you dump.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.599
This sounded like someone become hacked

18:22.685 --> 18:25.974
This was a cry,
as if cannibals. would have her.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.145
You will come with me,
the rest stays here.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.661
Victoria.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.178
What? What, man?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.434
Nothing.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.280
What the hell...?

19:19.784 --> 19:22.697
What the hell...?
Did you see something?

19:22.828 --> 19:25.662
There she wasn't.

19:29.877 --> 19:34.167
Where are you going?
- I'll get Celia.

20:00.116 --> 20:04.952
Come here, sweetie.
- It is ok.

20:05.079 --> 20:10.120
She is really good in 4-wins.
- What the hell is going on here?

20:59.759 --> 21:05.130
Please, don't  kill me.
I just want  go home.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.178
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

21:09.310 --> 21:15.728
Come on, man. Stand up.
- Why am I here?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.816
What is this place?

21:27.703 --> 21:31.071
Already  ok, this is just another one.
- What is your name?

21:31.373 --> 21:37.961
Daniel. Daniel Levine.
- Are you alone?

21:38.798 --> 21:42.462
Yes. I... I...

21:45.095 --> 21:47.758
I don't remember.
I got back my mind in here.

21:47.890 --> 21:52.555
Oh. What a shit, man.
- Well done, Sherlock.

21:52.770 --> 21:56.309
Ok, enough is enough.
- Hey, hey. Let it be.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.194
Stop that, you make me sick.

22:05.199 --> 22:11.070
We're all frustrated, but fighting each other
doesn't bring anything.

22:13.916 --> 22:17.580
I heard screams.
Was that one of you?

22:37.022 --> 22:40.561
What do you see?
- Nothing more than fog, man.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.858
What do you mean with nothing?
- Exactly that I don't see anything..

22:44.989 --> 22:48.073
The fog is thicker than
your head, man.

22:51.161 --> 22:55.371
Oh god. What was that?
- Maybe a dog?

23:00.796 --> 23:03.789
I suggest that
we climb down there.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.876
Probably
down there in an ambulancy vehicle.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.845
Wait
- To hell with it.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.593
Hey, what are you doing?

23:13.267 --> 23:16.760
Didn't you hear,
what I said? Think.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.946
Do you still want to go down there?

23:37.791 --> 23:39.999
Please.

23:40.461 --> 23:43.044
And?
Maybe she has fallen on the grass.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.792
We couldn't hear her because of that.
- Or we are too high.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.628
You know what? Scrap on it.

23:50.721 --> 23:54.761
Can we find an
other exit please easy?

23:54.892 --> 23:57.805
Ok, calm down and think logically.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.350
Listen, sweety...

24:01.482 --> 24:04.190
Ah. Fuck.
My arm, man!

24:04.693 --> 24:08.437
Pull.
- It burns, it burns.

24:16.747 --> 24:21.617
Let me see.
- What the hell was that?

24:21.752 --> 24:23.960
What was that?

24:28.884 --> 24:32.753
Don't move, don't move.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.593
This must be tight fitting.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.270
We should split up.
- Jesus.

24:46.402 --> 24:51.318
What the hell is wrong with you?
- You wanted to separate yet.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.236
Yes, I did.
And you were against it.

24:54.368 --> 24:58.658
Not any more? Haven't you seen,
what happened straight away?

24:58.914 --> 25:01.748
Now we  shall seperate? Fuck.

25:01.875 --> 25:05.835
I don't think
that's a good idea.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.504
She's right.
Two groups are better.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.918
Fuck.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.418
So we have a  better chance to
 find an exit.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.342
What about the others?
Did you forget about her?

25:16.473 --> 25:18.305
We don't let her back.

25:18.434 --> 25:23.145
We are looking for her on the way.
- She has gone. You are on your own.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.434
Hey, that's bullshit.

25:28.360 --> 25:32.980
Well guys,  stay around here, if you want, but I won't stay here.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.823
Well, that yopu've hit the wall.

25:38.912 --> 25:44.658
Oh yeah? Why?
- Walls don't hit back.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.125
I'll find a way out of here.

25:49.256 --> 25:54.172
You can stay here and continue with
throw bottles.

25:54.303 --> 25:58.638
I see you
jumping jacks later. Bye.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.132
Asshole.

26:01.477 --> 26:05.061
Roger.
- Let this jerk go.

26:05.189 --> 26:10.935
Without him, we are better off.
I don't trust them anyway.

26:11.070 --> 26:15.360
Obviously we are in an
upper floor. Is she gone in there?

26:15.491 --> 26:19.485
We go this way.
If you see any stairs, scream.

26:19.703 --> 26:24.243
We meet here in 15 minutes.
- Exactly that happens,

26:24.374 --> 26:30.962
before the madman with the
hockey mask dismembered us.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.876
Things like that nobody wants to hear.
- Did all understand that?

26:36.512 --> 26:39.095
We meet here in 15 minutes.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.924
Come

26:52.778 --> 26:54.690
Victoria?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.823
Victoria?

27:14.883 --> 27:17.045
What do you see?

27:17.177 --> 27:21.171
Looks like we would come
thereby to the other side.

27:21.765 --> 27:27.227
I'll go first.
You take Celia and follow me.

27:27.354 --> 27:31.849
Why do I have to go last?
- First or Last, Nadir.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.146
Decide.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.400
I actually thought that.

27:37.698 --> 27:42.818
OK. Wait till I'm on
the other side.

28:02.639 --> 28:09.307
Everything ok?
- Yes. Yes. I am fine.

28:10.439 --> 28:15.275
You should not touch anything,
if you  come through there.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.727
Oh shit.

28:39.051 --> 28:44.467
OK. I'm through.
Your turn.

28:44.765 --> 28:49.760
Ok, honey, don't worry,
I'm just straight behind you.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.143
Carefully.

29:08.413 --> 29:12.077
Don't forget:
No to touch anything along the way.

29:16.713 --> 29:21.833
Jess. Jess, are you ok?
- Yes. Yes, ok.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.565
Here is a boy.
- Nadir. Did you say something?

29:37.693 --> 29:42.654
A child. I'll get it.
- Who you bring?

29:42.781 --> 29:47.617
Hey. Where are you going?
- What the hell are you talking about?

29:51.081 --> 29:54.916
Carefully. Everything ok?

30:10.684 --> 30:13.347
Jess, are you ok?
- Yes.

30:21.862 --> 30:26.072
Sam. pull me out. Sam.
Pull me out.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.075
Sam, pulling me out.

30:31.997 --> 30:35.490
Are you OK?
- Something was inside there.

30:39.504 --> 30:43.623
What was going on?
- Inside there was something.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.608
Nadir? Nadir?
Can you hear me?

31:12.913 --> 31:19.877
Looks like he may have to cope alone
. Just like we do.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.714
People? Can you hear me? People?

31:33.809 --> 31:37.393
Hey . Where do I know you from?
- Me?

31:38.563 --> 31:43.183
Yes. You look familiar.
- No idea.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.607
Do you call yourself sometimes Chuck?

31:51.827 --> 31:57.368
No. Charles.
Why are you asking me something like that?

31:59.418 --> 32:02.832
I don't know you, buddy.
And you don't know me.

32:02.921 --> 32:09.543
Sorry, buddy. I just want to find out,
where I know you from.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.470
What is your last name?

32:13.598 --> 32:18.559
Instead to ask so many questions,
you should better help me.

32:21.606 --> 32:26.351
Did you hear that?
What makes such noises?

32:26.570 --> 32:30.359
I don't know. But one thing is certain:

32:31.908 --> 32:35.743
It's not gonna be so easy to get there down.

32:43.086 --> 32:47.831
Hey, Rachel.
What are you doing here so alone?

32:48.300 --> 32:52.294
Do you want to see someting really cool?

32:53.930 --> 32:56.889
Come with me, little mouse.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.441
Rachel? Are you OK?

33:09.070 --> 33:11.187
Rachel?

33:15.410 --> 33:19.871
You...
- What's going on? What?

33:20.790 --> 33:24.704
Merely stay away from me.

33:26.213 --> 33:31.049
Hey, what's your problem?
- You know it damn well.

33:31.176 --> 33:35.011
What is she talking about?
- She goes crazy, that's all.

33:35.263 --> 33:39.098
Hey. Where do you want to go?

33:49.152 --> 33:52.896
What have you done to her?
- Let her go simply.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.784
Hey, guys. Don't let me back.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.039
Damn it.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.489
What breaked you up?

35:56.780 --> 36:02.401
This shit isn't real.
- Oh, this shit is very real.

36:23.473 --> 36:27.717
What's going on? Is something wrong?

36:28.311 --> 36:31.099
Don't you want to fuck me?

36:34.317 --> 36:36.183
And me?

36:48.373 --> 36:49.909
Or me?

36:58.049 --> 37:01.508
You don't us anymore?

37:19.863 --> 37:21.274
Go ahead.

37:27.454 --> 37:31.289
No.
- That is what you want, isn't it?

37:31.416 --> 37:34.830
Please, please...

37:35.795 --> 37:38.287
Do you get an erection of that?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.675
No?

37:46.389 --> 37:49.097
And how about that?

37:54.314 --> 37:59.730
Take what you want.
Anyway, that is what you do always.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.232
Stop. Stop.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.425
What are you doing? Sam?

38:41.402 --> 38:45.988
Do you know what that was?
- I'm not sure.

38:51.287 --> 38:55.827
Nothing makes sense here.
- Where the hell are we?

39:01.881 --> 39:05.295
Does your thoughts make any sense for you?

39:07.637 --> 39:11.927
None of them makes  sense,
mine minds too.

39:13.643 --> 39:16.807
What do you mean?

39:20.149 --> 39:24.860
I mean, do you have any
strange thoughts?

39:24.988 --> 39:28.652
Things that you haven't thought about for years?

39:28.783 --> 39:33.448
Because of some stupid reasons

39:33.830 --> 39:39.292
I 'm thinking all the time on people,
 to who I've done wrong.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.044
Yes, and?
- No idea.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.629
The memories don't go away.

39:44.757 --> 39:49.127
And what does that have to do with that here?
- No idea.

39:50.638 --> 39:57.602
I just cann't stop thinking about
these things.

40:06.279 --> 40:11.991
I had to...
I don't know that makes no sense.

40:14.245 --> 40:18.910
But I
... - But what?

40:21.085 --> 40:23.668
I was only 18

40:24.088 --> 40:28.207
I wasn't even in
the position to...

40:29.594 --> 40:33.008
Jess, what are you talking about?

40:35.224 --> 40:38.467
Nothing. Nothing. Forget about  it.

40:46.069 --> 40:50.439
It isn't my fault.
I didn't want that.

40:53.326 --> 40:57.320
Another one.
- Hey. This way, come on.

41:10.635 --> 41:16.051
What the hell does happen here?
- DO we really want to know about that?

41:34.367 --> 41:36.108
It's me.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.405
Jesus. I'd  almost cut
off your head.

41:40.748 --> 41:44.958
Oh shit.
What was that for a cry?

41:46.421 --> 41:50.756
I don't know.
I heard it and ran along here.

41:51.467 --> 41:55.211
Who was the old man?
- Which old man?

41:56.347 --> 41:59.431
I looked at the woman with the girl.
- Rachel?

41:59.559 --> 42:03.803
Yes. The one with the thing in the thing.
- What happened to her?

42:03.938 --> 42:08.433
I don't know. She has got freaky
because of this spooky guy.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.184
She freaked out?

42:10.319 --> 42:13.653
Something happened between her and Chuck.

42:13.781 --> 42:17.570
She freaked out and ran away.
- What happened there?

42:17.702 --> 42:21.946
I don't know. She couldn't stand him out
suddenly.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.580
And she's not the only one.
The guy is really disgusting.

42:26.711 --> 42:30.250
Is ishe ok?
- I know about that, when I find her.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.671
Did you found something?
- No.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.964
Just more corridors,
which  lead only to other corridors.

42:40.099 --> 42:45.015
As the shouting started,
didn't want to know where it came from.

42:45.688 --> 42:48.180
Stairways, exits,  or anything else?

42:48.316 --> 42:52.686
I didn't see anything,
but look by yourself.

42:57.325 --> 43:03.447
You are going in the direction of the screams?
- I have no choice.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.913
Do you come with us?
-Do I have a choice?

43:08.002 --> 43:10.790
Yes, man, free will.
Do what you want.

43:10.880 --> 43:16.046
I stay here, in the case
that the girl appears.

43:16.511 --> 43:19.299
Yes. Do that.

43:36.155 --> 43:38.522
Wait.

43:40.993 --> 43:43.280
What? What?

43:51.629 --> 43:53.586
Sam?

44:00.638 --> 44:03.472
From whom is all that blood?

44:09.021 --> 44:10.728
Sam?

44:26.205 --> 44:29.198
don't move, okay?

44:44.640 --> 44:49.852
Sam? Sam, talk to me.
From whom is all that blood?

44:50.062 --> 44:53.521
Is that from...?
- I don't know.

44:53.649 --> 44:59.145
Currently i'm busy with where
all these people come from, included us.

45:00.364 --> 45:04.028
I don't think
that we are here by chance.

45:09.916 --> 45:13.580
Who is that?
- My husband.

45:15.296 --> 45:18.835
Why?
- Where is he?

45:20.301 --> 45:24.671
He is gone.

45:25.556 --> 45:29.550
Gone? What do you mean?
- He died.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.096
Three years ago.

45:36.025 --> 45:38.233
A drunken driver.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.738
Sam.
- Daniel?

45:44.450 --> 45:47.033
Dan, where the hell is he?

45:48.246 --> 45:51.739
Do you tell me, what's going on?

45:51.874 --> 45:55.117
We need to get out here quickly. Now.

45:56.420 --> 46:01.791
Daddy. Daddy.

46:07.181 --> 46:09.468
Hello.

46:31.580 --> 46:34.243
Hi, Daddy.

46:38.254 --> 46:39.995
Mischa?

46:45.886 --> 46:50.096
How?
- Are you not happy, to see me?

46:59.984 --> 47:05.196
You're not my daughter.
My daughter is dead.

47:05.781 --> 47:11.448
That you know better than anyone else,
isn't it?

47:13.456 --> 47:17.040
Who is the black one?
- My friend.

47:17.168 --> 47:20.832
You won't see him anymore.
- You can't determine about that.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.504
Whom do you think are you talking to?

47:30.306 --> 47:35.552
It was an accident.
I didn't want that.

47:35.978 --> 47:40.313
Was it an accident, to make someone else paying
for that?

47:43.486 --> 47:48.447
What you wanted to do,
wasn't right.

47:48.574 --> 47:52.909
How do you live with these lies,
this hatred?

47:54.830 --> 47:57.914
And just because your girl
fucked a nigger?

48:04.382 --> 48:07.045
I didn't want that.

48:11.555 --> 48:16.471
Misha.
What do you want from me?

48:19.271 --> 48:23.686
You have to fix it,
this is what he requires.

48:56.934 --> 48:59.392
Yes, father.

49:06.068 --> 49:08.776
Almost.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.890
Forgive me, Misha.

49:41.437 --> 49:43.929
Forgive me, god.

50:19.433 --> 50:22.141
Isn't it too high,
to climb down?

50:22.269 --> 50:24.682
It doesn't matter, we've got to try it.

50:24.813 --> 50:27.726
We need  to get out of here,
as quickly as possible.

50:36.242 --> 50:39.485
Why did you ask me, who he was?

50:41.872 --> 50:43.613
Sam.

50:48.003 --> 50:53.465
I've seen him.
- You knew Jason?

50:59.765 --> 51:03.475
When we met each other
 for the first time , I said,

51:03.561 --> 51:05.678
there was a man in the blue suits.

51:05.813 --> 51:07.520
Yeah.

51:08.315 --> 51:14.607
The man in your locket,
is the man in the blue suit.

51:14.738 --> 51:17.902
I'm sure.
- What?

51:20.452 --> 51:23.160
You heard me.

51:25.082 --> 51:30.419
Fuck you.
Why do you say that?

51:30.588 --> 51:33.831
Jess, please.
- You could't have seen him.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.507
This is impossible.

51:37.219 --> 51:41.088
Something is wrong with this place.

51:41.223 --> 51:44.387
You've to trust me.
- Trusting you?

51:44.518 --> 51:47.306
I shall trust you,
if you say something like that?

51:47.438 --> 51:50.977
If you say you had
seen my dead husband?

51:51.108 --> 51:56.570
Then tell me why we can't find an
exit. Huh?

52:05.831 --> 52:07.618
Think about it.

52:07.750 --> 52:12.120
We wake up in a building without
damn exits,

52:12.254 --> 52:17.215
and no one knows how he got there.
Nobody.

52:26.685 --> 52:28.847
What do try to tell with that?

52:32.441 --> 52:34.023
Fuck.

52:34.860 --> 52:38.945
Remove that. Remove that
thing away from me. Remove it.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.483
Dudge down.

53:08.352 --> 53:13.188
Do you see?
Nothing is normal.

53:27.121 --> 53:31.365
Help me, please.
Oh god, help me. Help me.

53:35.295 --> 53:37.161
Help me.

53:37.756 --> 53:40.294
Please. No.

53:40.968 --> 53:44.837
Help me.
Please, help me.

53:44.972 --> 53:47.635
Please. No, no.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.995
Please.

54:15.878 --> 54:19.542
I was only an unborn child.

54:22.885 --> 54:26.549
So, Teddy...

54:34.688 --> 54:38.602
You can't change the past.

54:39.818 --> 54:44.984
Didn't you tell that to all the people,
 who you owed money?

54:49.745 --> 54:55.912
Greed is one of those pathetic
sins, which, if it would be up to me,

54:57.252 --> 54:59.585
were non sins anymore.

55:02.591 --> 55:07.382
Please.
- But it happens to be a sin.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.173
In his opinion.

55:15.479 --> 55:20.565
Please. No.
- I was towards to you more than fair.

55:21.527 --> 55:28.070
I gave you all, well, enough
opportunities to do it well.

55:29.952 --> 55:36.665
Let's just say you've screwed up,
 Teddy.

55:36.792 --> 55:40.536
No. No. Please. Please. No.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.341
No, please.

56:33.473 --> 56:35.806
What are you doing?

56:36.810 --> 56:40.019
Inside there it is safer.
- Sam.

56:42.190 --> 56:45.900
No. No. No.
- Show her how to use that.

56:54.703 --> 56:59.698
Celia? Celia, do you see?
Here, try it.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.743
Do you trust me?

57:03.837 --> 57:06.750
With that you've light
so that you can see something.

57:12.012 --> 57:17.428
Carefully . Ok, Celia? I let you down
until you see the first door.

57:17.559 --> 57:21.644
And I hold you, so that you can climb out.
 Be careful.

57:21.772 --> 57:26.608
Don't move, when you're down.
We'll get you out there, promised.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.061
Oh god. OK.

57:30.197 --> 57:32.029
Slowly.

57:45.462 --> 57:48.125
Jess. Come on, Jess.

57:49.091 --> 57:52.129
Run, Jess.

58:25.127 --> 58:28.245
little jerks
Little jerks..

58:32.384 --> 58:36.128
Come out, from wherever you are.

59:20.974 --> 59:25.093
Well. How you want that.

59:29.024 --> 59:30.560
Ups.

59:50.796 --> 59:55.507
Celia. Celia. No.
We've to get her, Sam.

59:56.635 --> 59:59.218
Sam, we've to go and get her.
- We've got to get away from here.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:03.465
We've got to leave before
who ever comes back.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.597
Let me go. I must go to her.
- Jess. Jessi. We both want that.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:14.477
But we can't do anthing for her,
when these things come back.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:19.443
We must stay in front of them, okay?

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.368
Come

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.175
People?

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:56.233
Who's there?
I blow your head off.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.370
Jesus.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:27.173
Hey, pst. It's okay.
Pst. It's okay.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:30.768
What are you doing here all alone?

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:37.271
I should stay in the laundry room, but
I got scared and hid.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.980
That's ok, little mouse.
You've found me.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:51.701
Are you ok?

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:58.629
Do you want to come with me?
I take care of you.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:04.677
Uncle Charles will
care about you well.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:23.820
Sam.

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:26.611
Stages.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.528
OK.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:45.171
Take care of your eyes.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:09.613
Jessie, what are you doing?
- I can't go without her.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:13.203
Not without Celia.
- I see that the steps lead out.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.699
It can't be deeper thant that.
- I know.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:21.045
And we'll find it, but I
must see if this is worthing it.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:24.210
Do what you want.
I'm not leaving without her.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:29.212
Wait. Jess.
Damned women.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.304
Celia?
- Celia?

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:34.471
Celia, here we are, sweetie.
Where are you?

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.349
Celia?
- Celia?

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:40.931
Celia?

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:45.819
I hope that none of this monsters got her.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.116
Celia?

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.669
I don't believe that.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.840
Looks like she's gone this way-
Let's go.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.236
You're beautiful.

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:42.039
Did you know that, little mouse?

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:53.172
Please don't.
- It's ok.. That's OK.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:58.384
I don't hurt you. I like you.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:04.686
And it's not usual to hurt someone,
we like.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:10.275
You like me too, right?

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:17.695
I just want to be your friend.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.663
And a little game play.

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:31.834
You like games, right?
- Play with that, you bastard.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:43.350
You are fatter and older, but
still the same disgusting jerk.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.932
You still
little girl, isn't it?

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.480
I'm sorry, ok?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:52.776
Stay down.
- I am sick. It is a disease.

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:55.820
I've no control about that.
- Charles?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:06:00.617
You'll not call yourselg Chuck,huh?
Is that too embarrassing for you?

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.123
No. Please.
- Stay down.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:08.417
Please, stop it. Please.

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:21.969
Help me. They'll kill me.
- Oh, I know. Wonderful, isn't it?

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:28.725
Do you remember me?
I remember you.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:34.276
What's the matter? Can't you remember the girls
 you've fucked?

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:40.745
I'm sorry. This is a
disease. I can't something for it.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.207
I hate it.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:50.796
Please?
- Come on, little mouse.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.088
Do what you gotta do.
- don't call me like that.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:59.590
His fate is sealed.
He ​​has made his choice.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.720
Revenues this piece of shit.

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:07.639
If you don't sojourned him,
who will do it? Who, Rachel?

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.688
Please.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:18.654
Non.
- Shut up there. He's right.

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:24.905
Turn around and close your eyes.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.700
No.

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:33.631
Not. No, please.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:38.544
Rachel, no!

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:45.551
Do it. Take his life,
for all these peoples life, he has destroyed.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:51.140
Rachel? Listen to me,
you may not do that.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:55.065
He just wants.
He ​​plays with us.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:08:01.909
Don't listen to it. Forgive him or kill him
that are your options.

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:03.527
We've seen,

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:07.282
how he and one of his creatures
killed one of us.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.625
He plays us off against each other.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:15.044
He deserved to die.
He ​​had no right to do that.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.756
No, he hadn't.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:22.880
Maybe he deserves to die,
but here it's not going  about him.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.551
Here it is going about you.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.515
He is a piece of shit.
- Please.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:34.893
I know that, but if you do that, you're damned.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:39.193
His fate is sealed, not
yours.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:43.779
Stop Sam, Rachel.
Put it down.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.075
No.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:59.500
Slowly you're  make more trouble than you worth it, Sammy.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:06.590
This drivel
begins to bore me.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:10.890
Can you kill the motherfucker finally?
- Not.

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:16.818
Or maybe, just maybe,

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:24.868
Deeply inside, you enjoyed ,
that he touched you.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:45.964
You humans are much too simple.
- We need to help her.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:52.310
It is to late for her. Come.
- Run, my little parasite, run.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.808
Fuck you. I won.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.483
If you feel better then,

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:09.741
it makes no difference,
if you've killed him or not.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.912
The moment he
touched her, he was mine.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:19.960
But since you did,
you sweet ass too.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.926
No. No.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.646
Better luck next time,
old friend.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:59.583
What are you looking for?
- Whatever can serve as a weapon.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.632
Something like that?

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.967
This will be enough.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:25.863
I can smell you,
my little meat sacks.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:36.912
I don't understand how you human
could survive so long.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.327
So selfish.

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.755
So excessive.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.259
This makes sick.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.717
The longer you populate this world,
 the easier my job is.

01:11:54.852 --> 01:12:01.224
That killing, these lies, these deceptions.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:04.651
Sin to sin.

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.271
Ts, ts, ts.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:12.026
The world is falling apart.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.364
If you think about it, i do
to both of you a favor.

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:22.961
I redeem you from your pathetic existence.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:29.843
To get you all together,
it was like a gift by..

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.765
Well, you know by whom.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.268
To have you both so close,

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:43.141
that was, if he would beg me almost
to do something.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:49.109
It was like a...

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.283
Like a fucking miracle.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:19.097
Why he cares
to wounded souls?

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.345
Out of my way. Go away.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.408
Where the hell did he go to?

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.949
Come

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.355
That can't be.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.494
Quick. In here. Come

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:25.367
What are you doing?
We must go from here away, Sam.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.166
Celia, come here.
- Why?

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.916
You wont that,
but she is not safe by our near.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:37.092
He doesn't want her, he wants us.
- I won't let her alone again.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:42.594
If we separate, we can
slough him off and can come back than.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.687
This time we know where she is.
- No.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:54.234
I eighter won't to leave her alone,
but with  if she is with us she it isn't safe.

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.898
Come

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.946
Listen, you've to stay here for a while, ok?

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:06.579
We'll come back and get you,
promised. Go nowhere.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:11.081
Behave calmly.
Be very quite, ok?

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:14.674
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:21.923
Come

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.473
Wanker.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:32.939
Come

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.037
Fuck.

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:50.076
Jess.

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:52.412
Sam.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.711
Climb up on me.
- I can't.

01:15:55.843 --> 01:15:57.505
Sure you can.

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:03.932
Give me your hand.

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:08.512
No. No.
- No. Sam. Sam.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:11.105
Sam.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:19.155
Oh god.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:52.435
So you want to play  huh?

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.643
Strange.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:17:03.693
If you don't leave this room,
it is unsure what happens with Sam.

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.654
Stop.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:55.835
What do you want?
Who are you?

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:03.548
I'm whoever you want,
that I am.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.883
Oh, you silly girl.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:13.853
If you'd just knew  who your friend
Sammy really is.

01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:17.770
Then we wouldn't have this
entertainment surely.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:21.111
I know who he is.
Who are you?

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:24.527
Damn it, I have so many names.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:31.406
Let's just say I'm a collector,
and today was a very good day.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:38.788
Oh, your soul
smells absolutely delicious.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:44.676
Fuck you.
- Uh. That would please you, what?

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:51.559
Then you could  kill  a further life,

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:54.177
growing up in you.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:07.027
I could spend the entire day with talking to you,

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:09.947
but I won't let Sammy
wait.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.418
Sam?

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:23.210
Sam.
Sam. Are you ok?

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:28.925
Go. Let me here.
- Be quiet. I won't leave you here.

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:36.389
OK.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:45.570
How the idiom says.  It's funny until someone loses an eye.

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:59.997
What are you doing? What do you want?
I do everything, but please stop.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:04.130
Please.
- Who you wish.

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.127
Sam?

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.263
Why are you doing this to us?

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:24.810
Why I do that to  you?

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:33.736
The question is, why do
you do that to yourself?

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:38.581
I'm barely more that a tool
all this, my child.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:42.085
An observer, if you want.

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:47.583
Well, maybe something
more than an observer.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:51.132
I take influence,
inspire, motivate.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:53.346
You manipulate, you mean.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:59.056
Oh well.
It's not about me, right?

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:15.281
Did you tell it to her already, Sammy?

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:19.281
Told what?
- Not, of course not.

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:25.037
Have you ever stopped to think about
that night, Sam?

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:29.507
No. Of course not.

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:34.429
Do you have the habit
to let nobody in your life.

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:38.850
Those who are affected by your
deeds.

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:46.687
Does your self-pity prevents
that you care about that, Sam?

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:55.067
Let's talk about
people in the other car.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:59.237
What he's talking about?

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:07.670
Who the hell are you?
- No. No. No.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:12.167
Not who the hell I am.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:19.599
What would she do,
if she knew,

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:25.142
that you were the wanker,
who killed her husband?

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.606
What?

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:30.894
Sue?

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:39.995
Jason ? Jason.
Wake up, Jason.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.707
Oh. Yes.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:49.083
I'm afraid that's the
sad, uncomfortable truth.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.472
The truth will set you free, my mate.

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.985
Oh yes, my love.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:22.738
In front of you is sitting the man who,
has ruined your sad life.

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:26.495
The man who has taken you everything.

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:31.122
You might hate him,
for what he has done to you.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:35.501
It must eat you from inside.

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:40.714
To lose the man, you've loved.

01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:47.395
Endure this pain,
must be unbearable.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.317
The time has come.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:06.619
How long did you wait for the opportunity
for your revenge,

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:10.494
on the man who
did so much pain to you?

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:49.164
I'm so sorry.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:54.705
I never wanted that..
I'm so sorry.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:25:00.711
Do it.
This is your chance.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:07.476
The time has come for you to make your choice.

01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:19.150
Just do it.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:30.156
I forgive him.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.044
I forgive you.

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:56.232
I'll enjoy it,
to tear you piece in piece,

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:02.276
so how you did that to your unborn child has torn it out
from your body.

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:20.795
You may not intervene.
- The decision has been made.

01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:26.638
For him, yes. You heard me.
- You took who will take you.

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:33.387
You should move on,
before I get really angry.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:44.030
There is no redeem to her.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:48.322
Fuck you and your god,
you little cunt.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:12.470
Who says that?

01:27:28.452 --> 01:27:33.072
Are you ok?
- No idea. Are we ok?

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:44.253
What did he mean,
there is no redeem for me?

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:49.588
He's lying.
Or at least it is wrong with that and played with you.

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:57.012
There is redeem for you.
Redeem through forgiveness.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:06.279
Oh god.
Oh god, your face.

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:15.868
This eye. Oh god, I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:22.788
