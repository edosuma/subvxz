WEBVTT

00:05.295 --> 00:08.825
Forman, your bachelor party's tonight.
We're going to a strip club,

00:08.955 --> 00:11.379
so don't forget your inhaler.

00:13.199 --> 00:16.957
Come on, hyde.
I don't need a silly bachelor party.

00:17.010 --> 00:21.273
Oh, come on, man. Be one last night of the finest
debauchery that point place has to offer.

00:21.339 --> 00:25.659
Hyde, all I need is my sweetie
here for the rest of my life.

00:25.758 --> 00:29.780
- It's all right, eric. You can go.
- All right! I'm gonna see nudies!

00:31.355 --> 00:35.611
Oh, eric, you're not going to one of those
hoochie mama shows, are you?

00:35.940 --> 00:39.029
Don't worry, mrs. Forman.
I'll return your son in the same

00:39.094 --> 00:41.877
slightly girly condition that he leaves in.

00:42.597 --> 00:46.165
So, donna, you and the gals getting
together for a big shindig?

00:46.244 --> 00:48.405
Well, jackie might be planning..

00:48.503 --> 00:51.613
No, wait. She doesn't do things
for other people.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.591
Well, let me plan your bachelorette party.

00:54.657 --> 00:58.389
Oh, we went absolutely bonkers at mine.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.087
All my girlfriends came over for a sewing bee

01:01.088 --> 01:05.388
and then my friend gloria gave me 
my first sip of hard cider.

01:05.991 --> 01:09.053
Boy, you girls are crazy.

01:09.184 --> 01:12.190
Well, back then,we had some morals, 
not like you girls today..

01:12.191 --> 01:15.191
loose, throwing it around 
town like the paperboy.

01:21.525 --> 01:23.784
donna, why am I blindfolded?

01:23.882 --> 01:28.315
because I have a big surprise for you.
Okay, you ready?

01:31.490 --> 01:33.520
Isn't it awesome?

01:35.124 --> 01:39.183
We're gonna spray-paint our
names on a trailer? All right!

01:39.281 --> 01:44.172
No, I put a deposit on i tso we can live here.
Eric, it's gonna be our very own.

01:44.303 --> 01:48.984
Oh, how romantic. I can just see donna
carrying you over that threshold.

01:49.672 --> 01:51.309
So come on.

01:51.407 --> 01:54.156
I know you always dreamed
about having a home of your own.

01:54.255 --> 01:56.742
Well, I guess I should have been more specific.

01:56.841 --> 01:59.408
Um, no, no. You know what?
This is nice. It's nice.

01:59.506 --> 02:01.517
Donna, this is great!

02:01.615 --> 02:05.314
Steven, if you ever rent me a trailer,
I will dump you in a second.

02:05.576 --> 02:08.817
Good to know.
I need an exit strategy.

02:14.316 --> 02:18.506
See, now if we all turn this way...

02:19.058 --> 02:23.285
There. See?
Room for everybody.

02:24.104 --> 02:28.621
See? Now this is the closeness
I've been craving.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.320
Whose hand is that?

02:32.596 --> 02:34.593
- Mine.  - Mine.
- Mine.

02:37.146 --> 02:40.485
Oh, man. Look at this tiny shower.

02:40.551 --> 02:45.633
Donna, I don't think there's room in there
for you to soap your chest like we like.

02:45.901 --> 02:47.308
Donna...

02:47.701 --> 02:52.251
are you sure you want to live in point place?
I always thought you wanted to leave town.

02:52.382 --> 02:53.551
Well, eric, that's when I was single. 

02:54.152 --> 02:57.552
But now that we're getting married, I want to 
settle down and start our lives together.

02:57.849 --> 03:00.500
Yeah, but I always thought...

03:04.036 --> 03:06.167
- You smell pretty.
- Okay.

03:08.294 --> 03:11.502
Look, can we do this in private?

03:11.731 --> 03:13.957
Bathroom's free.

03:14.383 --> 03:16.871
Um, actually, I was just, uh,

03:16.969 --> 03:19.162
heading there.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.310
Excuse me.

03:21.556 --> 03:23.624
Pardon me.

03:24.174 --> 03:26.374
Excuse me.

03:31.323 --> 03:34.728
Let me just get the, uh, curtain.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.169 --> 03:55.320
okay, I can't do this with all you listening.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.411
Somebody's gonna have to sing.

04:00.680 --> 04:05.058
- Fez, you sing.
- I can't do both at the same time.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.725
Please hurry!

04:09.789 --> 04:13.021
On the good ship lollipop

04:13.071 --> 04:21.083
it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
where the bonbons play...

04:21.165 --> 04:23.783
I had a large soda.

04:24.561 --> 04:30.085
On the sunny beach of peppermint bay

04:31.084 --> 04:34.036

04:40.925 --> 04:44.033
Merci Ã  Raceman

05:08.576 --> 05:12.478
So it's ours starting today.
I signed the lease for a year.

05:12.557 --> 05:16.365
Donna, all you ever talked about
was seeing the world, and

05:16.443 --> 05:19.795
And my dad's better now.
I mean, we can get out.

05:19.874 --> 05:21.033
Well, I don't wanna get out. 

05:21.034 --> 05:23.734
I just want to focus
on doing this marriage thing right.

05:24.022 --> 05:29.626
And I think that means curling up every night next to you
on that dining room table that doubles as a bed.

05:30.543 --> 05:33.240
Well, the good news is,
if you guys do decide to travel,

05:33.318 --> 05:36.992
You can always drive your house
to any number of vacation destinations.

05:37.319 --> 05:42.328
Yeah, and if you ever want to rearrange your furniture,
all you gotta do is slam on the brakes.

05:43.572 --> 05:45.143
Hold everything.

05:45.372 --> 05:48.220
I believe that is the ice cream man.

05:48.711 --> 05:51.180
Oh, wait. Look, he's turning around!
No! No,

05:51.278 --> 05:55.239
Come back! We're not from here!
We won't rob you!

05:56.876 --> 05:58.218
Oh...

05:58.807 --> 06:02.899
I mean, it's pretty here.
There's lots of open space.

06:03.030 --> 06:07.743
I'm coming in, tracy! There better not be anyone
in there with ya!

06:08.202 --> 06:10.998
Hey, the neighbors seem really nice.

06:13.290 --> 06:18.691
Just tell him you're naked 'cause.. I don't know.
That's why I'm climbing out the window.

06:19.575 --> 06:21.932
Casey kelso?

06:22.063 --> 06:24.485
Hey! Pinciotti.

06:24.714 --> 06:30.293
Casey, I thought you left town after going out with donna
and then breaking up with her so she had to settle for eric.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.944
Yeah, well, I found my way back.

06:33.042 --> 06:35.629
Hey, for-play.

06:35.792 --> 06:39.655
- You been working out?
- Oh, um,

06:39.851 --> 06:43.910
- Well, yeah, a few days a week.
- Oh, man, I'm just kidding.

06:44.041 --> 06:47.721
Well, it's not funny. He's huge.

06:47.819 --> 06:51.583
Things are great.
Eric and I are getting married.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.842
I'm on the radio.."hot donna."

06:53.940 --> 06:57.967
You might've heard people talking,
wishing they could date me, that kind of stuff.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.847
Yeah, I mean, donna hasn't thought
about you at all,

07:00.946 --> 07:05.529
although eric's mom still asks about you.
Then she kind of giggles and fans herself.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.460
You! You get back here!

07:07.558 --> 07:12.108
Hey, little advice.. never answer the phone
when you're with a married lady.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.423
See, forman? Now at the bachelor
party you can hold a beer

07:20.554 --> 07:23.762
even after you've lost
the ability to hold a beer

07:24.482 --> 07:26.722
from drinking all the beer.

07:33.007 --> 07:35.102
I like it.

07:36.346 --> 07:40.775
Kind of makes me wonder why god didn't just make us
this way from the start, you know?

07:40.943 --> 07:44.216
Don't worry, man.
Evolution will take care of it.

07:44.871 --> 07:50.632
Hey, steven, I took out all the $1 bills from your wallet,
so now you have nothing to tip the strippers with.

07:51.091 --> 07:53.088
All I have left is this $20?

07:53.218 --> 07:56.132
Jeez, I'll never be able to get change for this.

07:59.831 --> 08:04.573
Sorry I'm late, guys.
I spent all afternoon in front of the mirror.

08:05.064 --> 08:08.042
Then I realized it was time to get dressed.

08:10.530 --> 08:15.146
Fez, you don't have to look nice, all right?
Strippers like everybody.

08:15.309 --> 08:19.139
They're raised that way on special farms out west.

08:19.270 --> 08:24.294
Okay, eric, I talked to my boss down at the radio station,
and I told him we were staying in town,

08:24.425 --> 08:28.353
and I said that if he wanted to keep me,
he would have to put me on the air full-time,

08:28.418 --> 08:32.912
- And he went for it! "Hot donna" every day on wfdp.
- Oh!

08:32.993 --> 08:36.405
Oh, donna, that's amazing.
All you had to do is ask?

08:36.471 --> 08:39.908
Oh, and I tied my shirt up in one of those sexy knots.

08:40.432 --> 08:45.492
Yeah, jackie does that.
We have never paid to get into six flags.

08:46.878 --> 08:52.229
- Wait. But, donna, if you take this job, how are you gonna..
- Why are you waving a mug at me?

08:53.147 --> 08:55.504
I'm sorry. How are you gonna
find time for college?

08:55.635 --> 08:57.449
I don't know. I'll just stop going.

08:57.515 --> 09:01.599
Eric, I'm a deejay. I already have the kind of job
I was going to college to get.

09:01.698 --> 09:07.008
Yeah, college sucks anyways. It's all smart people,
and none of them are as pretty as me.

09:07.924 --> 09:13.489
Yeah, that's true. Half the people in this
roomought to be in magazines.

09:15.748 --> 09:19.288
Only half, though, and the rest of you
know who you are.

09:22.627 --> 09:25.835
Eric, we both have jobs.
We have a great place to live.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.174
- We're gonna have the perfect life in point place.
- Huh.

09:29.273 --> 09:35.132
That's funny. I've never heard the words "perfect life"
and "point place" used in the same sentence...

09:35.721 --> 09:40.146
oh, except when separated by the phrase
"as soon as I get the hell out of."

09:40.702 --> 09:43.190
All right. We gentlemen have a place to be.

09:43.288 --> 09:48.427
So unless you ladies are gonna finally take
your clothes off to music...

09:53.646 --> 09:58.393
Last chance?
No? Okay.

10:02.634 --> 10:06.717
Wow, Mrs. Forman, you can really
whip up a party in no time.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.727
And we have activities.

10:11.469 --> 10:15.273
Okay, now watch.
You tie the ribbon in a bow,

10:15.377 --> 10:19.838
and voilÃ , decorative bags of almonds.

10:21.002 --> 10:24.418
We'll make 300 to pass out at the wedding.

10:24.754 --> 10:28.711
Wait, this is donna's bachelorette party?

10:28.969 --> 10:32.359
What other manual laborare we gonna do?

10:32.799 --> 10:36.238
Huh, scrub a toilet, dig a trench, write a book?

10:37.376 --> 10:40.585
Well, if we don't do this, who will?

10:43.949 --> 10:47.338
I can't believe you invited me over
and you don't have any dip.

10:49.789 --> 10:55.647
Red, we're having a girl's night out. I need you
to bag all the almonds and tie 'em with a bow.

10:55.891 --> 10:58.326
- Why me?
- 'Cause I said so.

10:59.323 --> 11:01.945
- I don't want to.
- Well, you have to.

11:02.411 --> 11:06.722
- Oh, you..you make me crazy.
- Oh, you..you make me crazy.

11:07.757 --> 11:10.297
- Fine.
- Good.

11:10.759 --> 11:14.226
Since you're getting married,
I'll teach you how to do that.

11:19.290 --> 11:23.813
- To forman and donna.
- TO FORMAN AND DONNA!

11:23.917 --> 11:25.651
Where is forman?

11:25.754 --> 11:29.713
- Who cares?!
- WHO CARES?!!

11:30.696 --> 11:33.589
How did I not know about this place?

11:34.469 --> 11:38.532
I spent my whole life trying to get girls
to take their clothes off,

11:38.609 --> 11:41.766
and all I needed was $10.

11:41.870 --> 11:46.062
You know, I don't understand why chicks
don't like guys to look at strippers.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.348
I mean, these women are artists.

11:50.166 --> 11:54.172
It's like leonardo.. or da vinci.

11:54.716 --> 11:58.000
- Bravo.
- Bravo. Bravo.

12:00.203 --> 12:01.745
Forman, where's your beer hand?

12:01.814 --> 12:04.576
I chewed off the tape in the men's room.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.986
Wait, that was you makin' those sounds?

12:09.331 --> 12:14.101
Hey, you know, forget what I said about
there being a mummy in the bathroom.

12:16.381 --> 12:19.456
I can't stop thinking about what donna's doing.

12:19.540 --> 12:25.605
The only reason she's still in point place is 'cause of me. If it weren't for me,
she'd probably be on the other side of the world by now.

12:25.667 --> 12:29.077
Hey, I grew up on that side of the world,

12:29.705 --> 12:32.320
and it's no picnic.

12:33.345 --> 12:36.364
Although when you eat every meal on the ground,

12:36.678 --> 12:39.983
I suppose, technically it is a picnic.

12:40.757 --> 12:42.565
Look, all I know is

12:42.628 --> 12:47.795
if I let donna stay in point place, she's gonna miss out
on all those great things she wanted to do,

12:47.885 --> 12:49.665
and it'll be all my fault.

12:49.726 --> 12:51.672
Forman, would you quit whining?

12:51.734 --> 12:57.048
Donna's gonna marry you. From where I'm sittin',
what's on your plate looks pretty good.

12:57.550 --> 13:01.217
You don't cut open the sausage,
Forman. You just eat it.

13:01.719 --> 13:05.485
Well, I wish it were that easy, hyde,
but it's a complex emotional issue...

13:05.548 --> 13:09.006
Hey, phil donahue, live nudes.

13:17.793 --> 13:22.594
Oh, well, now this looks like a good place
for a bachelorette party.

13:22.845 --> 13:29.023
Yeah, did you see that neon sign out front?
It had a naked man with an arrow pointing this way.

13:30.153 --> 13:33.667
Um, I don't think that was an arrow.

13:35.508 --> 13:42.282
welcome  to the little boy's room  where every night
is ladies' night.. everybody's pants come off.

13:42.386 --> 13:45.022
Well, that's a catchy slogan.

13:45.755 --> 13:51.966
These guys have been doing some hard time,
and they're dyin' to meet some ladies.

13:52.113 --> 13:55.962
Well, now he.. he looks like
he's been a bad boy!

13:56.025 --> 13:59.017
Take it off! Take it off!

13:59.728 --> 14:03.625
Is that how we do this? I'm not sure
how to be naughty in public.

14:05.383 --> 14:06.961
Ooh!

14:08.803 --> 14:13.566
These guys are goin' back to jail
for assault with a sexy weapon.

14:14.611 --> 14:19.562
Oh, my god, casey?
Oh, my god, casey!

14:28.522 --> 14:30.469
it's just,

14:30.532 --> 14:33.519
donna's giving up everything she ever wanted.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.092
I can't help but feel like
I'm holding her back, you know?

14:42.315 --> 14:46.765
Okay, just so you know,
I make most my money on tips.

14:47.015 --> 14:48.624
I'm sorry.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.510
Here, you.. y.. y..

14:52.614 --> 14:55.898
- You should probably just take this.
- Thanks.

14:56.358 --> 15:01.058
Forman, would you quit depressing the strippers?

15:01.351 --> 15:04.777
When you depress the strippers,
they go like this.

15:05.263 --> 15:10.841
Yeah, this isn't some hole in the wall where hopeless losers
blow their money on people who don't care about their problems.

15:10.882 --> 15:13.431
This is a strip joint.

15:14.058 --> 15:17.860
Yes, it is, eric. You're ruining the romance.

15:19.649 --> 15:22.344
You, dance for my money!

15:25.582 --> 15:28.486
And the rabbit runs around...

15:29.907 --> 15:32.393
and then back in the hole.

15:34.805 --> 15:37.813
Hey, red, what do ya think of my nut bag?

15:40.299 --> 15:42.179
Ha ha, bob.

15:43.688 --> 15:45.756
I'm done with this.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.054
This is not man's work.

15:48.117 --> 15:52.650
I mean, if kitty wanted me to shoot the almonds
at some communists, that I could do.

15:53.114 --> 15:56.498
Oh, you're a big talker now that she's gone.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.590
I'm not afraid of her, and I'm not doin' this,

15:59.653 --> 16:05.335
and I don't care if it means I have to sit through
another one of her silent breakfasts.

16:06.471 --> 16:10.986
- What, she just sits there?
- I talk, she just ignores me.

16:11.150 --> 16:14.430
I had to buy a bottle of mrs. Butterworth's

16:14.493 --> 16:17.841
just so that someone would smile at me.

16:19.003 --> 16:21.078
You can always call me, red.

16:21.162 --> 16:23.104
I'd rather talk to syrup.

16:25.931 --> 16:29.669
- So workin' at a strip club.
- Yeah.

16:30.400 --> 16:35.894
I finally found a way to cash in on my good looks
without having to humiliate myself.

16:36.103 --> 16:38.760
No, you're not humiliating yourself.

16:38.844 --> 16:42.709
I mean, you're not the naked guy.
You're the guy who introduces the naked guy.

16:42.776 --> 16:44.238
Yeah.

16:44.322 --> 16:49.925
So I'm surprised to see you're still in town. You know, you'd always talked
about gettin' outta here. I always thought you'd be some place more

16:50.009 --> 16:54.542
glamorous by now, like paris or reno.

16:55.816 --> 16:59.018
Well, I've got eric and my job

16:59.123 --> 17:03.405
and a great place to live in and/or pull behind a car.

17:04.345 --> 17:08.174
I mean, it's not what I expected,
but it's definitely the right thing to do.

17:08.648 --> 17:10.644
You know,

17:12.537 --> 17:16.364
that trailer is tiny, and

17:16.564 --> 17:20.275
I need room to roam.

17:20.859 --> 17:23.282
born free

17:24.068 --> 17:28.497
as free as the.. something free

17:30.202 --> 17:35.509
you know, this town is so small,
I don't even know what free is.

17:35.674 --> 17:40.757
Yeah. Look, listen, I've been other places,
and it's not that great.

17:40.823 --> 17:43.383
I mean, since I came back here,
I've got it made..

17:43.434 --> 17:47.812
free drinks, I can borrow any of these
freaky costumes when I want.

17:47.913 --> 17:51.159
Plus, you know,

17:51.577 --> 17:54.334
- It's showbiz.
- Yeah.

17:54.496 --> 17:56.158
So

17:56.309 --> 17:58.797
You're happy here.

17:58.919 --> 18:02.777
Yeah, and you will be, too.
And don't worry, you know,

18:02.878 --> 18:05.255
by the time you have a few kids,

18:05.338 --> 18:09.065
you'll probably be livin' in a much bigger trailer.

18:31.270 --> 18:33.162
Hi. You home already?

18:33.362 --> 18:37.708
I thought those boys would take your clothes
and leave you naked in indiana.

18:39.479 --> 18:43.006
You kids.. you just don't know how to do anything.

18:43.307 --> 18:44.761
Listen, dad,

18:45.596 --> 18:49.272
donna wants to stay in point place
after we get married. I..

18:49.958 --> 18:52.013
how can that be a good idea?

18:52.398 --> 18:55.249
Son, in this relationship,

18:55.646 --> 18:59.594
you're gonna have one instinct,
and donna's gonna have another.

18:59.970 --> 19:02.749
Always go with hers.

19:03.919 --> 19:07.721
If history has taught us anything,
it's that you're always wrong.

19:08.069 --> 19:10.200
What about the time that I...

19:10.826 --> 19:12.748
oh, yeah, I got nothin'.

19:13.463 --> 19:16.279
You know, being with your mother
has taught me one thing.

19:16.342 --> 19:21.485
A man can only rise to the level
of the woman that he's with.

19:27.871 --> 19:30.107
hey, what's up?

19:32.384 --> 19:36.040
I saw a naked man's butt.

19:48.277 --> 19:52.853
donna, happy fifth anniversary!

19:52.950 --> 19:58.424
Hey, I want you to put on your best dress,
because there's another sequel to "star wars."

19:58.884 --> 20:03.605
And mr. And mrs. Eric forman
are gonna be first in line.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.736
What's goin' on?

20:06.116 --> 20:07.767
I'm leaving you, eric.

20:07.955 --> 20:09.480
What? Wh..

20:10.608 --> 20:14.013
We could see the new Jane Fonda movie instead.

20:14.916 --> 20:16.942
Eric, I'm miserable.

20:17.047 --> 20:19.386
How can you let me settle for this?

20:19.449 --> 20:21.538
But you said this is what you wanted.

20:21.605 --> 20:26.473
Well, I was wrong. I guess I was just trying
to make you happy, and I forgot about myself.

20:27.016 --> 20:31.366
I mean, I wanted to see the world,
not the inside of a trailer.

20:32.222 --> 20:34.144
But, donna, I love you.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.906
I love you, too, but it's not enough.

20:39.454 --> 20:40.875
Good-bye, eric.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.765
- I'm sorry.... Yes,
- Can you just take that?

20:45.887 --> 20:48.818
- you can just squeeze through there.
- Thank you.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.605
hey, for-play.

20:59.924 --> 21:01.908
- Casey?
- Yeah,

21:01.992 --> 21:04.415
your mom said I could bunk here.

21:04.478 --> 21:09.387
But don't worry, bud, as soon as everybody's asleep,
I'm gonna head over to your sister's room.

21:16.654 --> 21:20.456
so beautiful morning, huh?

21:32.531 --> 21:37.649
boy, these waffles look great.

21:38.305 --> 21:44.766
