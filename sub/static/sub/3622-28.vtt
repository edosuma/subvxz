00:04.037 --> 00:06.005
BOY:
<i>Here's your change.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:07.906
Have a <i>muy bueno</i> day.

00:07.908 --> 00:10.175
Right back at ya.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.610
Okay, Rufus,

00:11.612 --> 00:14.113
it all comes down to this:
chimerito or naco?

00:14.115 --> 00:14.913
We must choose wisely.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.248
Oh, come on!

00:16.250 --> 00:19.284
Chimerito... delicity
and nutricity.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.252
Mm-mm!

00:20.254 --> 00:21.954
This century, please.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.222
But one must also consider

00:23.224 --> 00:25.724
the explosive effects
of the beanie chimerita.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.594
Please, for my nose's sake.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.896
Very good then, I'll have one
naco, <i>mi amigo.</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:33.565
Would you like the <i>gran</i> size?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.000
<i>Grande! Grande!</i>

00:35.002 --> 00:36.301
Sorry, Rufus, no can do.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.170
Not in this quarter's
fiscal budget.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.572
What <i>is</i> in this quarter's
fiscal budget?

00:40.574 --> 00:42.641
At this point.. a quarter.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.942
Loser.

00:43.944 --> 00:48.013
Hey, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that...

00:48.015 --> 00:50.549
I could have <i>grande</i> sized!

00:50.551 --> 00:51.650
Stoppable, I've been meaning
to give you this.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.892
It's from the boys
in corporate.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.654
KIM:
"Naco royalties check?"

00:55.656 --> 00:57.056
Ah, the naco, my wondrous

00:57.058 --> 00:58.057

00:58.059 --> 01:00.659

01:03.264 --> 01:05.064
Possible, come here, I need you.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.700
Oh, Ronald, it is a wonderment.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.169
It will change the world.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.738
Yes, yes, it shall.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.807
That's the way you remember it?

01:14.809 --> 01:15.841
Pretty much.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.277
Can I order now, please?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.812
<i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

01:19.814 --> 01:21.080
Open the envelope, Ron.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.614
Maybe the check's big enough

01:22.616 --> 01:23.682
for you to grande size.

01:27.687 --> 01:32.224
It-it's for ni, ni, ni, nine...

Operation Catastrophic Doom has

05:33.067 --> 05:35.067
Whoa, that's a lot of red.

05:35.069 --> 05:38.136
Maybe Operation Catastrophic
Doom should be scaled back.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.005
I mean, it is kind
of complicated.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.106
Complicated?

05:41.108 --> 05:43.508
It's simplicity itself.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.946
First, we fire a super laser
at the moon.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.482
The laser reflects off
a network of mirrors

05:50.484 --> 05:53.919
precisely positioned
to warm the Earth's oceans.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.054
Naturally, this will increase
the humidity,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.357
foster the growth
of the mosquito populace.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.592
Thus ends Phase "A."

06:00.594 --> 06:02.494
Now, in Phase "B"...

06:02.496 --> 06:03.929
Na-na-na!

If I can get this plan on
track, will you shut up?

06:08.535 --> 06:09.568
What do you need?

06:09.570 --> 06:12.437
A very large diamond.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.507
Done. I know exactly where
to steal one.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.509
Jimmy Ding,
the Bling Bling King?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.944
I can't believe

06:18.946 --> 06:20.579
I just said those words
with a straight face.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.546
Don't dis

06:21.548 --> 06:23.382
the Bling Bling King.

He's the only
jeweler who caters

06:24.918 --> 06:26.218
to people of The Ron's echelon.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.487
Right. The Ron needs
to let people know

06:28.489 --> 06:30.389
that he is a man of wealth
and taste.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.558
And this gold-plated stretch
limo doesn't send that message?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.327
Whee!

06:39.365 --> 06:40.899
<i>So you are</i>

or should I say Ronor?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.538
You should.

06:46.540 --> 06:50.142
The Ron, today I have for you
a piece so alluring,

06:50.144 --> 06:51.643
so enticing, so dynamic,

06:51.645 --> 06:54.045
that only a man
of your wealth...

06:54.047 --> 06:55.514
Can appreciate it?

06:55.516 --> 06:56.648
Can afford it.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.684

sapphire-studded toe ring.

06:59.686 --> 07:03.355
Appreciate the quality
of those baguettes.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.357
Yes, I dig the baguettes.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.391
Which are what?

07:06.393 --> 07:08.994
Ron, it's $45,000.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.095
Before tax.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.997
It's The Ron's money, Kim.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.199
He can do whatever
he wants with it.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.267
No, no, Kim's got a point.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.334
Thank you.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.636
Jimmy, I can't buy this.
I'm going

07:17.638 --> 07:18.570
to need something

07:18.572 --> 07:20.639
much more obscenely expensive.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.973
Oh, yeah.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.974
( <i>sighs</i> )

07:22.976 --> 07:24.142
I see.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.710
You know, I knew
from the moment

07:25.712 --> 07:28.146
that you stepped
into my establishment

07:28.148 --> 07:30.048
that you were a man
who would not,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.983
could not settle
for second best.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.953
I used to settle for last place,
but money changes everything.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.987
( <i>forced cough</i>)

07:35.989 --> 07:38.023
You should
get that checked, Kim.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.091
The Ron can't afford
to get sick.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.294
The Ron, it is now clear
to Jimmy Ding

07:42.296 --> 07:43.695
that you have destiny.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.996
Not yet, but I think

07:44.998 --> 07:47.699
I'm bidding on one.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.134
Your destiny

07:49.136 --> 07:53.972
is to wear this
200-carat, diamond pinkie ring.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.742
That diamond... it's
as big as my fist.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.077
It is my destiny.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.046
My pinkie was born for this.

08:01.048 --> 08:01.780
Boo-ya!

08:01.782 --> 08:03.081
Mr. Ding Bling King,

08:03.083 --> 08:04.249
how much does it cost?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.585
If you have to ask,
you can't afford it.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.153
I can't.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.756
Well, then, the asking price
is a paltry $12.8 million.

08:11.758 --> 08:15.594
A bargain for a destiny.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.995
Hit pause, Ron.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.097
There are so many
other things you could buy.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.198
Less tacky things.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.199
Like, Denver.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.667
You don't like it, Kim?

08:22.669 --> 08:25.136
Okay, show of hands, people.
Who digs the rock?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.204
Yeah, man.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.339
Oh, yeah, definitely.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.007
That's really cool.
Yeah, I dig it.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.108
Oh, that's great.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.010
Wow, Bonnie,
you didn't raise your hand?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.144
You agree with me?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.546
Let me get back to you.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.414
Can I get a ruby belt buckle?

08:36.416 --> 08:38.283
You can if I'm buying, baby.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.784
Can't argue with destiny.

08:39.786 --> 08:40.719
So, you ready to buy?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.153
How can I not?

08:42.155 --> 08:43.688
At $12.8 million,
it's a steal.

08:46.392 --> 08:50.795
No, when you steal it,
it's a steal.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.502
Gentlemen,
and beautiful lady friends,

08:57.504 --> 08:59.371
please, Jimmy Ding
the Bling-Bling King

08:59.373 --> 09:01.573

to keep the situation cool.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.674
Sorry, Mr. Ding.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.543
They're evil.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.312
Oh, just because I do bad
things, that makes me evil?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.247
Uh, yeah. You're a villain.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.582
Oh, you teenagers think

09:10.584 --> 09:12.317
you have it all figured out.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.819
Sometimes there are
shades of gray.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.288
Not in this case.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.557
No, but I'm just saying that...

09:18.559 --> 09:19.524
Shego.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.458
I'm on it.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.793
( <i>screams</i> )

09:24.297 --> 09:26.298
Don't worry, KP,
I got your back.

09:36.842 --> 09:37.676
What's with the posse?

09:37.678 --> 09:38.843
Ron's rich.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.844
Define "rich."

09:39.846 --> 09:41.479
Just south of billionaire.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.315
Really? Maybe I'm
on the wrong side.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.584
Yeah.... of my foot.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.752
Come on, lift with your knees,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.287
not your back.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.790
Drakken!
Huh?

09:54.860 --> 09:57.762
Mm, yes, this will do nicely.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.731
Hey, that belongs on my pinky.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.199
It's destiny.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.500
Shego! Let's jet.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.336
Fire it up.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.443
Clumsy much?

10:11.445 --> 10:13.678
Chill, chill,
The Ron is all right.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.481
Yeah, what about the money?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.316
A little beat up,
but still spendable.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.751
You had me so scared

10:19.753 --> 10:21.686
for a minute.
( <i>sighs</i>)

10:21.688 --> 10:24.489
The final piece of the puzzle.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.859
Operation Catastrophic Doom
is upon us.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.461
All I need to do is

10:29.463 --> 10:32.497
put the focusing diamond in

10:32.499 --> 10:34.165
my... my laser...

10:34.167 --> 10:35.533
( <i>grunting</i>):
Stupid diamond.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.768
Must be metric.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.136
Try turning it.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.804
I <i>am</i> turning it.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.139
It doesn't fit.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.874
My diamond
doesn't fit in my laser.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.376
Do you understand?

10:44.378 --> 10:46.211
So, build a new laser.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.245
Oh, that's right, Shego,

10:47.247 --> 10:48.546
'cause money just
grows on trees.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.614
( <i>door opens</i> )

10:49.616 --> 10:50.915
Shut that door! I'm not paying

10:50.917 --> 10:52.450
to heat the outdoors!

10:52.452 --> 10:54.219
Can't afford to
build a new laser?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.520
Well...

10:55.522 --> 10:58.857
I could...
if you'd lend me the cash.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.891
Say a million or...

10:59.893 --> 11:01.393
Forget it.

11:01.395 --> 11:02.827
Oh, come on, Shego.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.163
I'll let you rule Greenland.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.165
Think about it.
That's a lot of land.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.466
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.801
Greenland's the icy one.

11:09.803 --> 11:10.769
You knew that?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.203
I want... Iceland.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.438
The green one?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.539
( <i>growls</i> )

11:14.541 --> 11:16.441
Fine. What are you going to do?

11:16.443 --> 11:19.210
Go with my strengths.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.645
WADE:
<i>Kim, Drakken's on the move.</i>

11:20.647 --> 11:22.414
He's broken
into a top secret lab

11:22.416 --> 11:23.581
in the Mojave Desert.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.717
I'll grab Ron and we're gone.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.621
The Ron said
he wanted baby lettuce.

11:29.623 --> 11:30.622
Look at this.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.323
This is adult lettuce.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.425
Ugh.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.427
Do the job right or
get someone who can.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.628
Oh, man.
Sorry, The Ron.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.496
Little people just
don't understand.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.931
I understand, Ron.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.501
The Ron. <i>The</i> Ron.

11:46.872 --> 11:47.872
Ron, we've gotta...

11:47.874 --> 11:48.873
Yo. You on the list?

11:48.875 --> 11:49.674
There's a list?

11:49.676 --> 11:50.542
Name?

11:50.544 --> 11:52.210
Kim Possible.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.845
Not on the list.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.313
I'm his best friend.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.815
Who is <i>not on the list.</i>

11:56.817 --> 11:58.917
Ron and I have been
best friends since Pre K.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.952
Then I'd think you
would be on the list.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.588
Look, I don't care
about the list.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.457
The list is the law.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.392
You've only known Ron
for two days.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.761
Yeah, uh... don't try
mind games on me.

12:09.763 --> 12:12.464
Okay. Fine. I'll take
a different approach.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.765
So I said, "Oh, yeah?"

12:13.767 --> 12:14.966
And what did he say?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.801
He said, "Yeah,"
real mean and tough-like.

12:16.803 --> 12:18.236
ALL:
Ooh.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.571
Then what did <i>you</i> say?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.306
Nothing. And I bought the place

12:21.308 --> 12:22.607
and fired his sorry self.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.377
( <i>all laughing</i>)

12:30.249 --> 12:31.649
Ron, we're going after Drakken.

12:32.952 --> 12:35.453
Coolio! We're getting
my diamond back!

12:35.455 --> 12:37.789
Yeah. And stopping
his latest evil scheme

12:37.791 --> 12:39.290
will just be a bonus.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.259
Wade, start calling in
some favors.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.794
We need an airlift to...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.796
Kim, that won't be necessary.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.297
The Ron spread a little 'fetti

12:46.299 --> 12:47.632
and catch a little
somethin'-somethin'.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.567
Hmm.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.641
You like?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.676
It's wow-worthy.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.378
Is there anything I can do
to make your flight

13:00.380 --> 13:01.679
more comfortable,
Miss Possible?

13:01.681 --> 13:04.315
Just keep your eyes
on the clouds, please.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.650
Nuts?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.519
Yeah, nuts. Honey-roasted.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.521
Of course, sir.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.863
And you said money
can't buy happiness.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.064
Silly me.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.933
Sir, we are over the jump zone.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.903
"The Ron," Kim. <i>The</i> Ron.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.472
I like the jet.
Let's not push it.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.474
( <i>gasps</i>)

13:30.576 --> 13:31.910
Whoa. What's with the muscle?

13:31.912 --> 13:32.944
Oh, that's a team

13:32.946 --> 13:34.512
of covert ops
specialists I hired.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.414
You know, lighten
our load a bit.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.083
Call us The Ron Squad.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.820
No, no, it's the Kim Squad.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.021
They're a gift.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.490
Ron, you can't buy people.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.392
Have you been under
a rock this week?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.693
Sure you can.

13:50.462 --> 13:51.930
Whatever.
Let's just jump, okay?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.464
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

14:16.021 --> 14:17.055
No...

14:17.057 --> 14:18.890
No...

No.

14:19.893 --> 14:20.892
Ooh.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.427
Yes.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.662
That says Operation
Catastrophic Doom.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.531
Peachy. Let's
grab it and go.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.866
Uh, uh, uh, Shego.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.768
It must be compatible
with the focusing diamond.

14:31.804 --> 14:32.837
Ah!

14:32.839 --> 14:33.805
The perfect fit.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.006
Yeah!

Well, if so, let's
get 'em on the payroll.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.531
What's this?

Michaels, was that

15:37.604 --> 15:38.703
a butterfly twist?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.672
That earns an extra ten,
my friend.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.206
The fool has money?

15:42.208 --> 15:45.476
A ridiculously large
amount of money?

15:45.478 --> 15:49.013
Ooh, I'll finish Operation
Catastrophic Doom in style.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.516
Grab the buffoon!

15:51.518 --> 15:53.651
How can I be rich
and still be a buffoon?

15:53.653 --> 15:54.585
Uh-uh?
Uh-oh.

Well done, Shego.

will soon be parted.

still catch them.

So, you work
the extra hour, then?

Extra hour?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.198
We're paid by the hour, ma'am.

Can't afford it.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.906
Right. Best of luck.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.174
Watch that gal
with the glowing hands.

She's trouble.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.879
Uh, thanks.
That's a big help.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.856
Wade, I need you
to cross-reference

17:04.858 --> 17:06.124
all online retailers.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.059
Look for major spendage
and shipping addresses.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.194
Okay. Why?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.063
Because, if there's
anybody stupider

17:12.065 --> 17:13.765
with money than Ron,
it's Drakken.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.768

Hmm.
Do I need one of these?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.039
Oh, yeah.

Uh-huh. Absolutely. Yeah.

Oh, why not? It's not like
I can't afford it.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.680
Right, Stoppable?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.883
I think I learned
a lesson here, Rufus.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.284
Aw. Mm-hmm.

Never carry $99 million in cash.

And... and, oh, right...

don't try to buy your friends.

( <i>grunting</i> )

17:41.761 --> 17:42.860
Uh-huh.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.195
So, Stoppable,

17:44.197 --> 17:46.864
what do you think
of my Laser of Doom?

17:46.866 --> 17:49.200
Quite bling-bling,
wouldn't you say?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.701
Not anymore.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.170
Not since you used that term.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.171
Oh, come now.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.073
It was your fundage that made

17:55.075 --> 17:56.674
my evil dream come true.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.876
Oh, great. Scratch "fundage"
from my vocab, too.

17:58.878 --> 17:59.877
And did you meet

17:59.879 --> 18:00.912
my new pals?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.413
I can't believe

18:02.415 --> 18:04.882
you stole my money
<i>and</i> my peeps.

18:04.884 --> 18:08.286
Actually, once I had your bank,
they came on their own.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.354
At least Bonnie
didn't join you.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.123
She stayed loyal to The Ron.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.858
The brown-haired girl?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.093
Had to let her go.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.195
I prefer to surround myself

18:17.197 --> 18:19.030
with genuine friends.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.765
Take Shego, for instance.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.200
Faithful, loyal.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.334
Yo, Dr. D.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.802
Come on. Come
on, come on.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.806
Wait.
I'll make a withdrawal.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.643
Hey! Hey, hey.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.079
It's a start.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.381
All right, let's get
this "Operation

18:37.383 --> 18:40.384
Too Complicated
To Actually Work" over with.

18:45.691 --> 18:46.724
KP!

18:46.726 --> 18:47.892
You're busted, Drakken.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.627
No, no. <i>He's</i> dirty rich.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.063
but <i>you</i> will be
busted when I'm done.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.737
( <i>gasps</i>)

19:05.410 --> 19:06.811
Miss Possible,

19:06.813 --> 19:09.080
we have had our differences,
to be sure,

19:09.082 --> 19:11.182
but I'm in a giving mood today.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.917
How much for you
to walk away, hmm?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.118
Name your price.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.154
Okay. First,

19:16.156 --> 19:18.122
not interested,

19:18.124 --> 19:20.258
and second, that money is Ron's.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.996
Not that he was
any smarter with it.

19:24.998 --> 19:25.997
Only a true friend would say

19:25.999 --> 19:27.031
something that hurtful.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.332
Thanks, KP.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.435
Hey, this could be fun.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.237
How about I use the laser cannon

19:33.239 --> 19:35.439
to vaporize you clowns?

19:37.943 --> 19:39.877
Bail?
Oh, yeah.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.746
Let's get out of here.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.254
Shego! What are you doing?

19:50.256 --> 19:52.890
That laser cannon
is only to be used

19:52.892 --> 19:55.226
for Operation Catastrophic Doom.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.695
I am thinking outside the box.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.702
Ooh, I'd send you
a postcard from Iceland,

20:04.704 --> 20:07.438
but they don't deliver mail
where you're going.

20:14.079 --> 20:15.346
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:20.118 --> 20:21.819
Well, that's just great.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.189
Now how am I going to start
Operation Catastrophic Doom?

20:25.191 --> 20:26.958
You still got Stoppable's money?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.960
Yes, but...

20:28.962 --> 20:31.896
Yeah. We'll discuss
it in Reykjavik.

20:31.898 --> 20:32.763
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:37.035 --> 20:38.402
Sorry, Ron.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.806
How much of your money
did he get away with?

20:41.808 --> 20:42.907
All of it.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.009
You walked around
with the entire

20:45.011 --> 20:46.877
$99 mill in your pockets?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.312
Bonnie thought it was fly.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.281
Oh, Ron.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.749
So what do you think
the chances are

20:51.751 --> 20:53.317
that she fell in love
with the real me?

20:53.319 --> 20:55.253
Well...

20:55.255 --> 20:57.021
Move it, loser.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.360
Good seeing you, too.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.961
Actually, I thought
she'd be harsher.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.429
Hey, it's cool, KP.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.231
I may not be rich,

21:07.233 --> 21:08.466
but if I may wax philosophic

21:08.468 --> 21:09.867
for a moment,

21:09.869 --> 21:11.902
wealth isn't just
about your bank balance.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.805
If you count friends, then I'm
the richest man in Middleton.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.040
Thanks, Ron.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.808
Well, actually, now
that I think about it,

21:17.810 --> 21:19.510
most people have more
friends than I do.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.212
Yeah, I, actually, I only have
you and Rufus.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.246
Only?
Hmm?

21:22.248 --> 21:25.349
Er, uh... I mean, "only"

21:25.351 --> 21:27.051
as in, with best
friends like you,

21:27.053 --> 21:28.252
I don't need anyone else.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.387
Nice save.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.454
So, you got enough

21:30.456 --> 21:31.455
money for a tacodilla?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.224
Better than that, I have

21:33.226 --> 21:35.092
enough to <i>grande</i> size.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.294
Boo-ya!
Boo-ya!

21:40.032 --> 21:43.234
DRAKKEN:
<i>New evil lair, $34 million.</i>

21:43.236 --> 21:45.836
New laser cannon, $48 million.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.239
Operation Catastrophic Doom...

21:48.241 --> 21:50.474
A colossal waste of money.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.442
Shh!

21:51.444 --> 21:53.244
And now begins

21:53.246 --> 21:56.113
the reign of Dr. Drakken!

22:12.097 --> 22:15.266
Colossal waste of money.

22:15.268 --> 22:16.434
Shego!

22:16.436 --> 22:18.836
No Iceland for you.
