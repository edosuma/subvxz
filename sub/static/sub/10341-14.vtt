WEBVTT

01:56.699 --> 01:58.742
Good Lord.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.584
Andy,

02:07.752 --> 02:09.920
I want this dusted for prints.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.840
No one saw a thing.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.009
The blackout and the fire
drew everyone out of the building.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.595
- How long has he been dead?
- It's hard to say.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.264
We'll need an autopsy.

02:20.431 --> 02:24.560
Doc, if you lift up the victim's shirt,
I believe you'll find a stab wound,

02:24.727 --> 02:26.311
one inch beneath the sternum,

02:26.479 --> 02:29.857
penetrating upwards,
severing the aorta.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.367
You've seen this before.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.497
- Yeah.
- Any traces?

02:46.249 --> 02:48.500
No blood stains.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.421
What's this?

02:54.424 --> 02:58.343
- Douglas fir, Harry?
- Lodgepole pine.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.597
Hawk, footprints?

03:01.764 --> 03:05.184
Two sets, same boots,
one coming, one leaving.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.394
Heavier impressions
on the way down.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.229
Carrying the body.

03:09.397 --> 03:13.525
Coop, are you sure
Windom Earle's behind this?

03:20.825 --> 03:24.536
A short time ago, a vagrant,

03:24.704 --> 03:27.706
our victim, was befriended
and offered a lift.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.459
He was driven to a location
up beyond the ridge.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.630
The car will still be there.
He was stabbed once.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.175
He managed to run a short distance
before collapsing.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.344
Windom Earle
engineered the explosion

03:40.511 --> 03:43.305
that caused the power outage.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.935
He created a diversionary fire
that drew everyone out of the station.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.938
Brought the body in
through this window.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.901
Windom Earle
has been in this room.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.695
I can still feel his presence.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.866
Harry, we're not gonna find
any fingerprints in here.

04:03.034 --> 04:06.119
No mistakes. No slip-ups.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.538
Everything has its own rationale,

04:08.706 --> 04:11.708
precision, intelligence.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.212
Windom Earle is a genius.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.800
And he's taken his first pawn
in a very sick game.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.611
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs.
This is what we're gonna do.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.031
If there's one thing I learned from
my father before he flipped his wig,

04:43.199 --> 04:47.035
it's that a business relationship
is like a sacred pact.

04:47.203 --> 04:50.372
Equaled only by the closest
of personal relationships,

04:50.540 --> 04:53.750
where nothing is held back.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.627
Right.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.840
Do you wanna get rich, Bobby?

05:01.634 --> 05:05.512
- Immediately.
- Well, maybe I can help.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.684
Let's pretend that this is my father.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.687
- An ice cube?
- Right.

05:13.855 --> 05:18.191
And our job now is to help
my father come back from limbo land

05:18.359 --> 05:23.947
before he melts away and leaves us
with a handful of nothing.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.244
We wouldn't want that to happen,
would we?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.787
No.

05:33.166 --> 05:38.128
So from now on, Bobby,
I'm the one you suck up to.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.841
- What about Shelly?
- What about Shelly?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.144
Leo.

06:03.363 --> 06:24.257
Leo?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.773
No.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.068
No.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.071
Help me!

06:47.532 --> 06:49.616
Please! Help me!

06:51.119 --> 06:54.371
No! No!

07:00.336 --> 07:02.838
Leo? Please.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.119
Bad girl.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.205
Please, please don't.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.012
No!

08:01.397 --> 08:04.858
I swear. I'll kill you.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.116
Help me! Help!

08:25.087 --> 08:26.838
Shelly?

08:29.425 --> 08:31.760
Shelly.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.387
Shelly, come on.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.521
No. No!

08:47.610 --> 08:50.320
- No!
- Shelly?

08:50.988 --> 08:53.323
No, no, Leo.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.783
Shelly!

08:55.743 --> 08:57.369
- Shelly!
- No, please.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.830
- No!
- Leo, you bastard!

09:03.876 --> 09:05.502
Goodbye, wife.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.092
Shelly.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.010
Leo!

09:43.916 --> 09:45.208
Goodbye.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.752
- No!
- Aah!

09:58.472 --> 10:02.183
Bobby! Bobby.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.563
Everything's okay, baby.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.772
He's gone.

10:52.109 --> 10:55.612
- Here.
- Thanks, Harry.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.657
Well, no fibers, no prints.
You were right.

10:58.824 --> 11:02.744
If it is Earle, he didn't miss a beat.

11:03.204 --> 11:07.165
Mm. Did you hear anything
from Denise?

11:07.333 --> 11:10.835
The Bureau and the DEA cleared me
of all criminal charges.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.921
The suspension still stands.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.632
I'm waiting to hear from Gordon.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.385
In the meantime,
you're still my deputy.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.011
Mm-hm.

11:20.763 --> 11:24.641
If you want this case, it's yours.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.312
Harry, I want it.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.484
Harry.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.196
I found that car on the logging road
just like he said.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.948
No prints.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.034
And just so you know, Hank Jennings
didn't make the buy at Dead Dog

11:43.202 --> 11:45.245
because he was in the hospital.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.746
Claims he was hit by a bus.

11:48.165 --> 11:52.252
I cuffed him to the bed
and booked him for parole violations.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.588
Oh. Shelly Johnson called.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.382
She said Leo came to last night,

11:57.550 --> 12:00.677
attacked her
and ran off into the woods.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.596
Holy smokes.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.580
Lucy, we need to talk.
It's about Nicky.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.207
Little Nicky?

12:31.375 --> 12:34.169
Dick and I have been doing
some thinking and some looking,

12:34.336 --> 12:37.922
and we think he's a... He's a...

12:43.387 --> 12:44.637
A what?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.974
We think he murdered his parents.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.061
- He's 9 years old.
- I know.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.983
We think he was 6
at the time of the crime.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.737
I met little Nicky.
I've talked to little Nicky.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.948
If you two think for one second

13:04.158 --> 13:09.829
that I'll believe that a defenseless
little orphan is capable of murder,

13:09.997 --> 13:14.209
the both of you aren't fit
to be fathers to a chimp.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.544
Ow!

13:17.963 --> 13:20.256
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
right away.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.036
Hello, you must be James.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.246
- Um...
- Oh. Ha, ha.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.956
I'm Jeffrey Marsh.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.125
I've been hearing very good things
about your work from Evelyn.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.962
Well, you'll see how it is
when you take it out.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.215
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's lucky we found you.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.551
No, my luck.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.011
I hear you were, uh, on the road.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.264
Yeah, I will be soon.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.892
Ah, no itinerary, no deadlines.
I'm envious.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.185
Wish I was going with you.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.648
Maybe after I take her for a spin,
we'll talk shop.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.484
Sounds like we have a mutual love:

14:24.196 --> 14:26.155
Cars.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.200
Yeah, well,
actually I'm kind of overdue as it is.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.202
Of course he'll stay.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.830
There are plenty of things
I could find for him to do.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.582
Uh...

14:36.417 --> 14:37.667
Right, James?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.628
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.630
Excuse me.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.260
- Nice kid.
- He's done a fine job on the car.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.305
Mm. Let's see what it will do
on the open road.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.348
Goodbye, Jeffrey.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.958
Doc, it's Nadine I wanna talk about.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.377
Nadine wants to start dating boys

15:21.587 --> 15:23.004
and I don't know what to say.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.215
Is she sexually active?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.676
Active?

15:28.844 --> 15:32.805
Doc, I wake up every morning feeling
like I've been hit by a timber truck.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.393
It's the extra adrenaline.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.562
Well, it's downright dangerous.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.191
She's liable to kill a young kid.
I don't know what to say.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.693
Be patient.

15:46.528 --> 15:50.573
And, uh, tell her to be home
by 9:00 on school nights.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.873
Extra potatoes.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.500
Well, thanks.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.468
Ed, uh, Donna took the van
this morning.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.096
Said something
about looking for James.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.140
Is there anything
I need to worry about?

16:16.308 --> 16:19.811
Well, James is out west
a couple of hours.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.564
Trying to clear his head, I think.
Donna's taking him some money.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.360
Not easy being a parent, is it?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.529
Boy, I'll say.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.449
Well...

16:34.743 --> 16:37.870
- See you, Ed.
- Thanks, doc.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.087
Hank's in the hospital.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.214
He said a tree fell on him.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.926
Honey, that tree was a redwood
called Nadine.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.970
Yesterday after you left,
Hank jumped me.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.680
Right in my own living room.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.807
If Nadine hadn't shown up...

16:57.975 --> 16:59.767
Nadine took out Hank?

16:59.977 --> 17:02.353
Phew. And it wasn't pretty.

17:04.523 --> 17:08.401
Harry called. He said he'll be arresting
Hank for parole violation.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.987
When Hank gets well,
he may have to go back to prison.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.533
I think it's time I start correcting
a few of the mistakes I've made.

17:17.077 --> 17:20.663
Well, we could, uh,
start by getting a cabin.

17:20.831 --> 17:25.710
A couple of venison steaks
and a bottle of sparkling wine.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.170
People will find out.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.256
Let them.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.614
- Don't you knock?
- I'm sorry.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.283
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.996
You were good with Jeffrey.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.457
It didn't feel that good.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.296
I can change that.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.552
It's wrong.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.181
Love isn't wrong, James.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.188
Please don't leave me.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.565
Don't leave me alone with him.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.952
What a shot!

18:43.163 --> 18:45.581
I'm gonna go check my bike.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.941
So how does chess
figure into all this?

19:13.402 --> 19:17.989
Because Windom Earle and I played
a game every day for three years.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.366
He felt that all of life

19:20.534 --> 19:24.162
could be found in the patterns
and conflicts on the board.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.665
Because I never beat him.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.253
Now it's my turn.

19:33.547 --> 19:37.508
I'll publish my response
in the Twin Peaks Gazette.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.136
I don't know what else to do.

19:41.221 --> 19:45.057
Coop, you're gonna have to give me
some more information here.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.646
Harry, I've brought some baggage
to town I haven't told you about.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.405
Windom Earle was my first partner.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.159
Everything I know about the law
and the Bureau, I owe to him.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.245
Four years ago,
we drew the assignment

20:06.413 --> 20:09.790
of protecting a material witness
in a federal crime.

20:10.834 --> 20:17.006
She was a very beautiful,
very gentle woman.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.468
Her name was Caroline.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.970
She and I fell in love.

20:27.476 --> 20:33.105
One night, I failed in my vigilance.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.776
An attack was made. I wasn't ready.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.946
I was wounded
and I lost consciousness.

20:40.113 --> 20:44.325
When I came to,
she was in my arms.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.453
She was dead.
She'd been stabbed.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.458
The wounds on the vagrant?

20:53.460 --> 20:55.336
Identical.

20:56.713 --> 20:59.006
The killer was never found.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.385
My wound healed,
Windom Earle went mad.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.179
Institutionalized
until his recent escape.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.848
So why is he after you?

21:08.308 --> 21:10.142
Harry,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.561
Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.825
So he blames you for her death.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.207
It's much worse than that.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.876
I think he killed her.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.673
And I think he committed the crime
that she originally witnessed.

21:41.300 --> 21:46.345
Harry, Windom Earle's mind
is like a diamond.

21:46.513 --> 21:51.017
It's cold and hard and brilliant.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.062
I think he feigned the insanity
that sent him away.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.815
But at some point,
he lost the ability to distinguish

21:57.983 --> 22:00.943
between what's right
and what's wrong.

22:03.864 --> 22:07.199
You don't know
what he's capable of, Harry.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.536
You don't know.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.224
Coffee, please.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.821
I'm looking for a biker
named James.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.994
You look like someone
in need of help.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.255
I'm looking for someone.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.424
What's his name?

23:06.134 --> 23:08.511
James.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.472
James Hurley?

23:16.019 --> 23:17.728
Yeah.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.314
You know him?

23:20.482 --> 23:22.441
He did some work for me recently.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.276
What kind of work?

23:25.362 --> 23:26.987
He fixed my husband's car.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.283
Where is he?

23:31.493 --> 23:34.537
He left. Yesterday, on his bike.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.789
Where did he go?

23:37.332 --> 23:40.668
He said something about the ocean.
Mexico, I think.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.796
That's all?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.048
Are you
what he's running away from?

23:48.552 --> 23:51.512
Look, dear, why don't you go home?

23:52.139 --> 23:53.639
He'll be back.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.273
Coffee's on me.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.377
He's marching on Washington.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.255
We think he's getting close.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.426
- Ben?
- He prefers general.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.435
General.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.190
Jeb.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.527
He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.863
Oh. You're in the cavalry.

25:35.075 --> 25:39.203
Jeb, there is a great day upon us.

25:40.121 --> 25:46.210
By dawn, our troops will be
on the outskirts of Washington.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.921
By midday, it will fall.

25:49.714 --> 25:55.719
And we will once again walk
on our cherished fields at home.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.564
Only God can stop us now.

26:06.731 --> 26:10.776
And it is my firm belief, Jeb,

26:10.944 --> 26:14.655
that the Almighty is a Southerner.

26:15.115 --> 26:21.287
Hallelujah.

26:21.788 --> 26:25.291
You really think it's a good idea
for Ben to be carrying this sword?

26:25.458 --> 26:28.711
Well, uh, he thinks he's on a
forced march to Washington.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.297
You know, he's crossing
the Maryland border as we speak.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.924
What he's doing is quite healthy.

26:34.092 --> 26:37.428
I mean, by reversing
the South's defeat in the Civil War,

26:37.637 --> 26:41.056
he, in turn, will reverse
his own emotional setback.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.559
What he needs right now
is both your understanding

26:43.727 --> 26:45.894
and a Confederate victory.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.396
Men of the South,

26:48.523 --> 26:50.941
from this day
to the ending of the earth,

26:51.484 --> 26:54.153
we who fight
shall be remembered.

26:55.488 --> 27:00.492
For our bravery,
for the battle scars that we bear.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.912
We few...

27:06.041 --> 27:09.168
We happy few.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.758
We band of brothers,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.886
onwards to Washington.

27:19.054 --> 27:24.141
Oh, I wish I was
In the land of cotton

27:24.309 --> 27:26.977
Old time there I've not forgotten

27:27.145 --> 27:32.941
Look away, look away
Look away, Dixie land

27:33.151 --> 27:38.739
I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray

27:38.907 --> 27:42.826
In Dixie land
I'll take my stand

27:42.994 --> 27:48.832
And live or die in Dixie

28:02.138 --> 28:04.431
Major Briggs?

28:05.183 --> 28:07.643
I need to see the sheriff.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.813
Major Briggs.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.028
More?

28:18.780 --> 28:20.739
- I'm fine.
- Fine, Lucy.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.449
Fine.

28:23.451 --> 28:27.204
Major, what happened?

28:27.372 --> 28:29.832
Well, as men who have dedicated
their lives to service,

28:29.999 --> 28:31.917
I know
that you're able to understand

28:32.085 --> 28:35.087
how sacred I hold
the Pledge of Allegiance.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.048
And the cost one must pay
when breaking a pledge.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.758
It can be very great.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.136
Well, the Air Force, I thought,

28:42.303 --> 28:47.391
was not unlike other societies of men
dedicated to the fight for the good.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.769
Gentlemen, frankly, I'm worried.

28:50.937 --> 28:54.148
When my superiors questioned me
about my disappearance,

28:54.315 --> 28:57.401
they exhibited a degree of suspicion
and intolerance

28:57.569 --> 29:00.070
bordering on the paranoid.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.950
I must now admit that their motivation
in the search for the White Lodge

29:05.118 --> 29:08.287
is not ideologically pure.

29:09.372 --> 29:15.836
I believe that during my disappearance,
I was taken to the White Lodge.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.923
I can remember virtually nothing.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.093
But I have the clear intuitive sense

29:23.261 --> 29:27.014
that there is much trouble ahead.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.975
Major, what kind of trouble?

29:30.143 --> 29:33.353
I am not aware of the form
it will take.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.440
I will return.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.359
Until that time,

29:39.527 --> 29:42.780
I will be in the shadows
if you need me.

29:47.744 --> 29:51.163
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, major.

29:55.418 --> 30:00.672
- In the shadows. Can you beat that?
- Nope.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.927
Excuse me, sheriff, Agent Cooper,
may I show you something?

30:15.855 --> 30:17.523
Good.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.150
I wanted all of you to hear this.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.779
I've just spent almost the last 24 hours
with this charming young lady.

30:23.947 --> 30:29.159
And as you can see, uh,
I have no bruises, no broken bones.

30:29.327 --> 30:33.664
Any claims by her deceased
husband's brother that she is cursed

30:33.832 --> 30:37.042
or somehow responsible for his death
is nonsense.

30:37.252 --> 30:41.880
Now, what she does, in fact, possess
is a heightened sexual drive

30:42.048 --> 30:46.426
and a working knowledge of technique,
anatomy and touch

30:46.594 --> 30:50.556
that few men have ever had
the pleasure of experiencing

30:50.765 --> 30:53.433
or the skill to match.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.688
Is it hot in here?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.773
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.112
Lana, let me be the first
to congratulate you.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.239
Thank you.

31:07.407 --> 31:11.493
Well, I could never have done it
without Dr. Jacoby.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.998
Okay. Well, then,
we're gonna go bowling.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.961
See you later, guys.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.963
Hmm.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.392
Don't anybody move.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.186
Mr. Mayor.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.813
Put the gun down.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.525
Anybody that moves,
I'll blast her into kingdom come.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.694
And the hippie too.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.989
Dwayne.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.826
Dwayne,
this isn't gonna solve anything.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.455
- She killed my brother.
- Mr. Mayor, she killed no one.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.459
- Horse dung.
- Fellas, I've got an idea.

32:00.627 --> 32:04.296
Why don't we let Lana and the mayor
talk things over together? Alone.

32:04.505 --> 32:06.757
I don't wanna talk. I wanna shoot.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.885
Now, Dwayne,
you can always shoot later. Talk first.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.804
Come on, in here.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.599
Lana, it's okay. Mr. Mayor, please.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.854
Mr. Mayor, please.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.290
- Now what?
- We wait.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.584
- We wait.
- We wait.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.433
It's hard waiting.

32:58.601 --> 33:00.185
Mm-hm.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.106
Okay.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.441
Ready, men?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.069
Let's go.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.330
We've decided to adopt a child.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.670
He's so much like Dougie.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.506
I just feel like my husband's
been brought back to life.

33:29.674 --> 33:35.178
Well, I've been lonely and selfish.

33:35.346 --> 33:39.474
I hope you'll all forgive me
for my boorish behavior.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.602
Come along, my dear.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.819
I don't know about you guys,

33:50.987 --> 33:53.030
but I could definitely use
something to drink.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.865
- Me too.
- Oh, yeah.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.670
Hot dogs.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.007
- We forgot the hot dogs.
- Pete.

34:12.175 --> 34:16.386
We forgot the wienies.
All beef, with the skin on them.

34:16.554 --> 34:20.348
- Has Josie gone shopping yet?
- Yes, she's already gone.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.726
Well, if you think you can
tear yourself away

34:22.894 --> 34:27.439
from all this high-level executive
decision-making for a moment,

34:27.607 --> 34:30.358
I have something
I'd like to show you.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.989
Have you ever asked yourself

34:36.157 --> 34:40.452
how I really survived after the fire?

34:41.329 --> 34:44.623
How I was able to marshal
the resources necessary

34:44.832 --> 34:47.793
to defeat Benjamin Horne
and win back the mill?

34:47.960 --> 34:52.005
Now that you mention it, yeah.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.382
Come here.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.893
Pete Martell.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.399
Andrew?

35:13.319 --> 35:15.237
I saw the boat.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.699
- You...
- Take all the time you need.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.201
Good old Pete.

35:21.410 --> 35:25.205
As you can surmise,
I had my brother Andrew's help.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.417
Now, let me get this straight.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.881
You didn't die in the boat accident.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.424
We didn't tell you, Pete...

35:36.592 --> 35:39.719
With apologies much delayed.
- because you didn't need to know.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.639
Okay. Fine.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.724
We discovered the attempt
on my life was coming,

35:44.892 --> 35:47.519
so we arranged this little deception.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.981
Who tried to push the button
on you, Andy?

35:51.149 --> 35:55.443
Does the name Thomas Eckhardt
mean anything to you?

35:57.405 --> 35:58.530
No.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.991
Eckhardt and I
were business partners.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.660
I knew lumber, he knew Hong Kong.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.621
We made a lot of money,
had some fun.

36:06.789 --> 36:10.292
Then I got the better of him
in a piece of business,

36:10.459 --> 36:12.294
and he tried to stab me in the back.

36:13.379 --> 36:14.629
Really?

36:14.797 --> 36:17.507
He's a very dangerous
and powerful opponent.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.218
Eckhardt planned Andrew's death
for six years.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.763
Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?

36:24.182 --> 36:27.809
Pete, dear,
Josie worked for Thomas Eckhardt.

36:28.561 --> 36:32.314
Oh, my God.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.317
Does she still?

36:37.320 --> 36:40.405
We'll know when Eckhardt arrives.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.115
He's coming here?

36:42.283 --> 36:46.494
I've never known
Josie's seductive powers to fail.

36:46.662 --> 36:50.957
He'll come for her,
like a rat for cheese.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.967
Good evening. How may I help you?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.594
I have two suites reserved.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.680
- Name?
- Eckhardt.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.266
Thomas Eckhardt.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.353
Welcome to Twin Peaks.

37:51.894 --> 37:55.188
Andy, in here. We're gonna talk.

37:58.526 --> 38:03.196
Andy?

38:04.156 --> 38:07.200
Cooper. I need to ask you a favor.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.828
Harry, let's get one thing straight.

38:09.996 --> 38:14.040
I work for you now.
You say drink coffee, I'll drink coffee.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.336
This just came over the wire
from Seattle.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.507
Josie told me
she got away from him.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.927
Think Josie had something to do
with this?

38:26.095 --> 38:28.346
I don't know. I don't know.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.890
That's why I need you to find out.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.350
Okay, Harry.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.232
When Lucy told me
about your theory,

38:39.400 --> 38:42.193
I called the orphanage
and cut through the red tape.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.698
Nicky is no more a murderer
than Lucy or I.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.533
I believe "pathological"
was the phrase...

38:48.701 --> 38:52.329
Dick, I did not drop you on your head
when I brought you into this world.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.040
Don't give me cause to regret that.

38:55.207 --> 38:59.127
- Doc, it's just that...
- Shut up, the both of you, and listen.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.797
Nicky entered this world
through the back door,

39:02.965 --> 39:06.885
where hope and promise
never see the light.

39:07.053 --> 39:11.890
His mother was a poor immigrant
chambermaid at the Great Northern.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.893
Nicky was conceived
during an assault in a back alley

39:15.102 --> 39:16.936
by a man
who fled across the border.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.105
She never reported it to the police

39:19.273 --> 39:23.234
but when she began to show,
she reported it to me.

39:24.403 --> 39:29.532
But Nicky's mother had a dream
of a better life for herself and her child.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.370
A dream that she brought with her
to this country.

39:33.537 --> 39:37.207
She decided to carry that child.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.920
But the poor wretch
never saw the boy.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.923
She died just as Nicky
took his first breath.

39:45.424 --> 39:49.969
We buried her in potter's field
and sent the infant to the orphanage.

39:50.930 --> 39:55.683
For several years, Nicky was shuttled
from one state home to another.

39:55.851 --> 40:00.063
And then one day,
hope shined on little Nicky.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.650
A young, childless couple
took him into their lives.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.986
They were loving, caring parents.

40:07.154 --> 40:12.700
But it all collapsed one terrible moment
on an icy highway.

40:12.868 --> 40:14.077
There was a crash.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.914
Six-year-old Nicky managed
to pull his parents from the blazing car,

40:18.124 --> 40:20.083
but it was too late.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.044
And Nicky was alone again,

40:23.879 --> 40:25.797
as he is today.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.677
I hope you two are happy.

40:54.118 --> 40:58.621
- James, what are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

40:58.789 --> 41:02.333
Are you leaving? Are you leaving?

41:02.501 --> 41:04.794
I can't stay here.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.215
- I don't understand.
- It's wrong!

41:09.884 --> 41:13.428
- Because I'm married?
- Yes.

41:15.931 --> 41:17.307
Yes.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.560
I love you, James.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.566
I've never said that
to anybody before in my life.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.193
I love you.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.005
There's been an accident.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.966
Jeffrey is dead.

41:52.885 --> 41:55.970
- His car?
- Yes.

41:58.557 --> 42:00.600
You killed him.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.854
No. No. No.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.398
My God! You set me up!

42:07.608 --> 42:10.485
It was Malcolm's idea.
He's not my brother.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.446
Hurry, James.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.783
Go find that young girl
who loves you.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.377
Go.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.512
James?

42:37.680 --> 42:39.389
Donna?

42:39.557 --> 42:41.266
Donna.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.851
We gotta hurry.

42:53.153 --> 42:55.863
Come on. Come on.

43:58.677 --> 44:02.722
Where is Shelly? Bad girl.

44:12.691 --> 44:15.318
No, no. Come in.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.862
It's all right. I'm a friend.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.328
Come in.

44:29.375 --> 44:32.418
You look like
you've had a very hard night.

44:33.545 --> 44:35.505
Come. Sit.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.675
I will help you.

44:40.177 --> 44:42.178
What's your name?

44:43.055 --> 44:45.890
- Leo.
- Leo?

44:52.564 --> 44:55.483
Well, Leo.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.195
You can call me Windom.

45:00.906 --> 46:10.892
Windom Earle.
