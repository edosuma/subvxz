HE CAN DO BAIT
AND STACK THE POTS

13:03.650 --> 13:07.318

ALL RIGHT THERE, TOMMY.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.756
OH, MY GOD.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.792

GETTING WORRIED 'CAUSE IT --

13:47.794 --> 13:49.961
IT'S WHERE I EXPECT
TO SEE CRAB.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.438

14:14.020 --> 14:17.221
HOLY [BLEEP]
THAT'S A LOT OF TRASH.

14:17.223 --> 14:20.057

A DIRTY CRAB HAS BARNACLES
OR SPOTS ON ITS SHELL...

14:23.796 --> 14:25.229
YEAH, YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO GO TO A STORE

14:25.231 --> 14:28.299
AND SEE STUFF LIKE THIS
ON THE CRAB LEGS THEY BUY.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.167
Narrator:
...MAKING THEM LESS APPETIZING

14:30.169 --> 14:32.703
AND PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS
TO THE CANNERY.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.673
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR GOOD, CLEAN, WHITE LIDS,

14:35.675 --> 14:37.975
NO BARNACLES.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.213

14:42.215 --> 14:45.583
THAT'S NOT A GOOD START
TO MY MORNING.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.853
BUT MAYBE I'LL RUN INTO 'EM.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.392

PROBABLY NOT.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.304
THERE'S NOTHING DOWN HERE.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.140
I NEED TO GET
THESE POTS SOMEWHERE

WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

15:33.733 --> 15:37.034
I REALLY DID NOT
WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS.

ABOUT IT TOO MUCH,

HE'S GOT NO PROBLEM
DOING ANY JOB ON THE BOAT.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.232

THAT COME OUT HERE
AND DO THIS FISHERY.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.715

16:37.029 --> 16:39.463
YOU GOT A POT ON YOUR BOW.

SO WITH ANY LUCK,

WE'RE GONNA END THIS
WITH A RELATIVELY QUICK TRIP.

18:25.371 --> 18:28.839

A NICE LITTLE BONUS IN CASH.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.976
Narrator: ...THIS TIME,
FOR 150,000 POUNDS OF BAIRDI.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.578
THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.413
SO I COULD DO THIS.

THAT WE'VE DONE ALL THIS WORK.

WE HAD BAIRDI.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.694
AND WE WERE LOOKING FOR OPIES.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.996
SO WE'RE BACK.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.697
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRY

AND AVOID THE OPIES.

IF WE CAN DO THIS TRIP
REALLY FAST,

19:08.714 --> 19:13.017
WE CAN, UH, MAKE MORE MONEY
FOR LESS CRAB POT.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.653

WE SAW IS STILL HERE.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.354

19:17.356 --> 19:19.223

IS BAIRDI CRAB.

A LEAK SOMEWHERE.

IS IT TASTE OR WHAT?

20:29.362 --> 20:31.762
YEAH.
OOH, HORRIBLE.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.797

HAVE ENOUGH --

TO DO THE FULL TRIP.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.771
THAT'S REALLY [BLEEP] NEWS,
ACTUALLY.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.473
WE GET THIS GEAR
IN THE WATER,

20:42.475 --> 20:44.575
WE CAN LOOK AT
THE TANK AND SEE --

20:44.577 --> 20:46.877
SEE IF THERE'S
ANY CRACKS.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.178
Narrator:
TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE,

20:48.180 --> 20:51.682
THE CREW MUST SET
AND CLEAR THE DECK OF GEAR.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.451
IT'S A PROBLEM.
ALL WE CAN DO IS TRY TO FIX IT.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.720
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS SO MUCH.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.756
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT [BLEEP]
IT'S CRAZY.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.928
IT'S A REAL GAME CHANGER.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.497
WE HAVE ANOTHER
FULL TANK OF WATER.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.601
WE JUST GOT TO FIND OUT
WHERE THE TANK WAS BREACHED.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.004
WE HAVE BASIC TROUBLESHOOTING,
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,

21:14.006 --> 21:17.508
THE ALTERNATIVE IS
FISH AS LONG AS WE CAN

21:17.510 --> 21:20.677
ON A BOTTLED-WATER SUPPLY
AND THEN HEAD IN.

21:20.679 --> 21:22.179
Narrator:
IF THE CREW CAN'T STOP THE LEAK,

21:22.181 --> 21:23.981
THE BOAT WILL LOSE TWO DAYS

21:23.983 --> 21:28.118
AND 11,000 BUCKS ON A TRIP
BACK TO TOWN.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.321
LET IT GO.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.091
WE'LL GET IT FIGURED OUT AFTER
WE GET THE POTS IN THE WATER.

"WHAT'S NEXT?"

I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
LIVE WITHOUT WATER.

COMES OFF...

IF WE CAN'T IDENTIFY

23:23.670 --> 23:25.436
MIGHT NOT -- MIGHT NOT
FIND IT OUT HERE.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.938
IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE SOMETHING
WHERE WE DRAIN THE TANK

23:26.940 --> 23:28.206
AND HOP IN IT.

23:28.208 --> 23:30.275
IT COULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE
OF THE BOAT LEAKING IN...

HEY, ZACK.

23:40.587 --> 23:44.455
SEE WHERE THIS PIPE CONNECTS
TO OUR TANK AND THE HULL?

23:44.457 --> 23:47.492
IT'S CRACKED RIGHT HERE.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.826

23:53.933 --> 23:55.767
ONE NICE THING
IS WE HAVE TWO TANKS.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.035
AND ONE OF THEM'S ISOLATED.

23:57.037 --> 23:59.070
SO WE HAVE ONE TANK
OF GOOD FRESHWATER ONBOARD.

23:59.072 --> 24:00.271
WE'D HAVE HALF THE WATER,

24:00.273 --> 24:02.340
BUT WE'LL BE ABLE
TO GO ON WATER RATIONS
