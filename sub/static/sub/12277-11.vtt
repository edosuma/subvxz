WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.662
CARTER: Previously on
Eureka...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.248
We think we may
have uncovered

00:05.422 --> 00:07.333
possible espionage
in Eureka.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.418
GRACE: Well, um...

00:09.593 --> 00:10.799
This doesn't look good,
does it?

00:10.969 --> 00:13.301
There was someone
on that disk that
you tried to destroy.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.222
And I can restore it.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.595
Don't do that.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.097
Who are you protecting?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.017
You.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.723
You introduced me
to Beverly Barlowe.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.933
HOLLY: You're all
just staring.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.691
Uh... We're just not
used to seeing you alive.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.102
I'm not used to
being alive.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.658
Is that supposed
to happen?

00:35.494 --> 00:36.654
What the hell is that?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.041
lam telling you,
Shenﬁ.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.043
He has been acting
very suspiciously.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.205
Well, you guys have been
neighbors a long time.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.463
20 years.
Yeah.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.623
But there's always
been something

00:51.802 --> 00:53.008
that I didn't quite
trust about the guy.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.418
Okay, well thanks
for telling me about it.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.676
I'll talk to
Dr. Hadler.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.098
Oh! Here you go.
Thank you.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.221
Talk about what?

00:58.392 --> 01:01.600
He's out in his backyard
in the middle of the night.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.977
Like, for hours.
With all this
weird equipment.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.978
Of course he is.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.935
Oh. So you're
defending him?

01:08.110 --> 01:09.190
Well, yes.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.226
It isn't suspicious behavior
if you're an astronomer.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.443
Just... You know what?

01:12.614 --> 01:15.276
I'm gonna check on it.
I promise.

01:15.701 --> 01:16.861
Thank you so much,
Shenﬁ.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.906
Good day, Dr. Blake.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.655
I'll be keeping
my eye on you.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.456
(CHUCKLING)
What is that?
Okay.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.461
It's been like this
all week.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.839
Everyone thinks
everyone else is hiding
some huge secret.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.672
Well, I understand
how they feel after Grace.

01:35.846 --> 01:36.801
Yeah.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.213
Yeah. At least there haven't
been any formal espionage
charges laid.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.302
Unfortunately, that's not
gonna help Henry any.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.218
No. No, I do wish
we could make it
a little easier on him.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.136
Oh, I love you.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.601
You know that,
don't you?

01:48.775 --> 01:49.981
Yeah.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.310
See ya.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.648
See ya.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.946
Initial, and initial,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.366
thumbprint,
date of birth.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.247
Oh, which time?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.245
Oh, you know, let's leave
that one blank for now.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.002
lnitial, signature,

02:12.049 --> 02:12.959
initial.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.749
(SIGHING) How much papenNork
does it take to bring
someone back to life?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.009
Well, we need to
inform all relevant
government agencies

02:18.180 --> 02:20.171
that a death certificate
was filed erroneously.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.555
Which is a massive lie...

02:21.725 --> 02:23.135
Which is technically true.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.346
So officially,
Dr. Holly Marten
never died.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.555
Ah, hand cramp.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.142
Oh, yay, l have hands.
(CHUCKLES)

02:30.150 --> 02:31.651
I'm done, what next?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.776
No next. Congratulations,
you're alive!

02:35.322 --> 02:36.653
Oh, seriously?

02:38.575 --> 02:40.782
But really,
what next, next?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.738
Well, you live
your life, Holl.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.325
Not many people
get a second chance.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.909
You're right.
You're right!

02:47.084 --> 02:48.449
I could do anything.
I mean, um,

02:48.627 --> 02:50.663
what kind of astrophysics
should I focus on?

02:50.837 --> 02:51.997
Or... Or I could teach.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.003
MIT, Caltech...

02:54.174 --> 02:56.039
(GASPS) Kindergarten.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.546
I loved kindergarten.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.923
I'm never gonna be able to
decide what I wanna do.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.804
FARGO: That decision is
completely up to you.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.885
I am the no-pressure
boyfriend.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.142
Well, you can use
my lab if you want.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.724
You know,
for your research,
thinking, whatever.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.263
You know,
when l was seven

03:11.441 --> 03:14.683
I got a Barbie Jumbo Jet.
With the first-class
accessory pack.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.065
I thought that was
the absolute best gift

03:17.239 --> 03:18.900
anyone could
evergeteveh

03:20.450 --> 03:21.530
l was wrong.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.359
Doug, thank you.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.279
Thank you.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.119
Good morning.
Oh, hey, Jo.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.249
Guess what? I'm legal.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.869
Good to know.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.459
Security reports
for the director.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.760
Hey, she was just
saying thanks.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.840
I know.

03:43.014 --> 03:46.006
And after what
you did for her,
you deserve it.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.596
Good, ljust wanted
to be clear.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.056
It might be impossible
for you to believe,

03:51.231 --> 03:52.937
but I actually trust you.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.314
Hmm.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.395
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
Oh!

03:57.279 --> 03:58.564
Lupo.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.616
| just wanna know
how they found out.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.779
l'm required to file
security updates
every 72 hours.

04:08.957 --> 04:09.992
You couldn't fudge it?

04:10.167 --> 04:12.249
Look,|buned
Grace's arrest
as deeply as I could.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.751
But I'm not gonna lie.
My signature is on it.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.001
All right.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.879
Stupid integrity.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.376
Miss Lupo.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.465
You have a G.D. employee
in custody under suspicion

04:24.639 --> 04:27.255
of espionage and passing
of classified information.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.298
Is that accurate?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.468
Yes, sir... Major.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.971
Well, we still don't know
what happened, sir.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.312
The Justice Department
will be taking over that
investigation immediately.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.525
All evidence will be
placed under seal

04:39.696 --> 04:41.607
and the prisoner
will be in our custody.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.114
You should've called me
immediately, Jo.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.650
Yes, sir.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.986
We are handling it, sir.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.286
Apologies, Sheriff,

04:50.457 --> 04:51.913
but Dr. Monroe
is one of your people.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.619
Your instinct is
to protect her,

04:53.794 --> 04:55.580
and we need
to be ruthless.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.790
If there's anyone else
involved in this breach,

04:57.964 --> 04:59.795
we'll find them.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.175
That was pleasant.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.152
(WHIRRING)

05:29.412 --> 05:30.538
There are a number
of projects

05:30.705 --> 05:32.445
that we should be
talking about from
our last communique’,

05:32.624 --> 05:33.830
but I'd like
to put those aside.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.582
Because the new project
in Section Five

05:36.753 --> 05:37.708
is worthy of our attention.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.665
I will send
a follow-up report.

05:39.840 --> 05:44.334
Also, I have made
preliminary contact
with Senator Michaela Wen.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.376
She seems aligned
with our goals,

05:46.555 --> 05:49.262
and would be
an enormous asset
if we could recruit her.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.888
I will continue to...

06:00.277 --> 06:02.609
JO: All this to test
some Smart Dust?

06:02.779 --> 06:06.271
ALLISON: Well, it's one
of G.D.'s most important
geo-engineering projects.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.576
Well, Smart Dust,
like self-cleaning dust?

06:08.743 --> 06:11.325
No, it's a way
to reverse climate change.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.657
Hmm.
How does dust do that?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.322
Smart Dust.
Okay.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.876
Well, global warming
is caused

06:17.043 --> 06:19.295
when solar radiation
is trapped
in the atmosphere.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.498
So, we're trying
to reflect some
of that heat

06:21.673 --> 06:25.416
using microscopic devices
coated in barium titanate.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.713
You know that shiny thing
that you put in
your windshield

06:27.888 --> 06:28.843
when you're
parked in the sun?

06:29.014 --> 06:32.177
Yes.
Yeah, like a gazillion
tiny versions of those.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.326
We can change

even the reflectivity.

What?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.417
Now that's cool.

07:01.588 --> 07:05.001
They're being contained
by a cool plasma field.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.708
Completely safe.

Wow.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.305
So, what happens next?

07:14.476 --> 07:16.467
We're gonna spray them
at 200 meters.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.347
Are you using drones?

07:18.521 --> 07:21.308
The director has decided
to go another way.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.893
Hmm.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.790
Thanks for coming down.

11:16.968 --> 11:20.085
I am in need of a handsome
and brawny test subject.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.469
Well, you are a charmer.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.839
Just right here
is good. Perfecto.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.178
And may I say
it's wonderful
to have you back.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.302
Thank you.
It is good to be back.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.937
I have lots
and lots to do.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.640

11:34.819 --> 11:37.401
That appears to be
some type of neural
harmonic with a, uh...

11:40.783 --> 11:42.034
You are so smart.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.408
CARTER: Well, of course
I believe in punctuality,

11:52.587 --> 11:55.454
but I think at the end
of the day there's...

11:55.632 --> 11:56.792
Henry.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.634
Good to see you
up and about.

11:58.801 --> 11:59.961
Uh, where's Major Shaw?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.047
Uh...
Uh, well he's, uh...

12:02.222 --> 12:03.632
He's putting together
some files.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.546
Yeah, which isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.885
For Grace.
Yeah, yeah.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.391
No, he's, uh...
He plays it hard,

12:08.561 --> 12:09.550
but he's a stand-up guy.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.515
And he just wants to
make sure that there
aren't any more breaches.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.102
Um...

12:15.777 --> 12:17.893
I'm here
to surrender myself

12:18.321 --> 12:21.313
to local law enforcement
and GD. Security.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.235
What are you
talking about?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.570
I'm the second spy.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.905
I stole
classified information

12:27.080 --> 12:28.911
and I persuaded Grace
to do the same.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.743
I recruited Senator Wen

12:30.917 --> 12:32.657
and all the damage
that she caused,

12:32.835 --> 12:37.329
the kidnapping,
Holly's death,
everything.

You're serious?

Henry.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.519
VVhy?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.643
You'll have to ask
the other Henry
from the other timeline

12:56.818 --> 12:58.149
to get the answer
to that question.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.526
This all happened
before we altered things.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.358
Before we took our
little trip to 1947.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.443
Right. Okay.
So, it wasn't you.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.732
Jack.
But it was another you.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.401
Not you, you. Right?
Back me up on this.

13:08.579 --> 13:12.197
Jack, you can argue
origin philosophy
all you want.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.616
But it does not
change the fact.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.752
But in reality,
you didn't do anything.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.162
He's right.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.298
Grace is sitting in a cell
because Henry
showed her the way.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.129
If you're gonna punish her,
then you have to punish me.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.010
And do not try
to absolve me

13:26.180 --> 13:29.138

of quantum physics!

13:34.564 --> 13:35.724
Hmm.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.311
This is hard. I know.
I'll find Major Shaw.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.772
Well, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Henry, wait, wait.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.487
You're doing this to be
fair to Grace, right?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.071
In part.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.406
Then shouldn't you
talk to her first?

13:51.581 --> 13:54.038
Well, I could get you
a couple minutes.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.540
It doesn't change anything.
Thank you.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.081
If you're doing this
to be fair to Grace,

14:03.259 --> 14:06.422
please, don't do anything
until you speak to her.

14:07.972 --> 14:08.927
That's fair.

Ooh! Hi.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.575
Oh, man! You missed it,
it was awesome.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.162
See, I came in low
under the rising sun...

14:38.336 --> 14:39.621
Yippee. So glad.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.788
I need your John Hancock.
Well, Doug Hancock.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.126
Uh, sure.

You're... You're working
in the bio-printing lab.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.307
Yes! I have decided
what I wanna do
with my life.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.721

14:59.899 --> 15:01.184
Yeah, but this
isn't your field.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.565
I mean,
you're an astrophysicist.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.236
You've never done
biochemistry.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.689
The bio-printer saved me.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.605
I really wanna try
to advance the technology
for other people.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.614
Hmm, well, yeah, I guess...
I guess that makes sense.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.946
But you said you were
gonna take some time
before you decided.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.657
And I decided.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.912
Come on, be happy.

a couple minutes.

Great, she'll talk
some sense into him.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.939

where Henry would do
something like this.

The Henry we know
isn't responsible, though.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.114
Yeah, well the law
would say something
different.

say anything about

can be petty

and careless
and negligent, true.

And I've...
What was I saying?

20:26.392 --> 20:29.179
That no one at G.D.
would have maliciously
stolen the device.

one other thing, though.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.214

if you have the time,

21:04.388 --> 21:06.299
maybe you could
check on Holly?

And she wants to
devote her entire life
to studying it.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.194
Well, it makes sense

21:26.368 --> 21:28.825
that she would
be attached to
that particular technology.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.202
Yeah, well,
I'm just concerned

21:30.372 --> 21:33.079
that maybe she's throwing
herself into something
too quickly.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.286

I could stop by,
and say hi.

Okay, not laughing.
Let's start that again.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.386
What do you
need me for, darling?

21:51.560 --> 21:54.427
The D.O.D. is
confiscating the evidence
in the Grace investigation.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.766
And I need a list
of everything
they're taking.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.057
Talk to Shaw.
He's your buddy.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.100
It's a D.O.D. case now.
And Shaw is by the book.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.360
And he's not gonna
tell me anything.

22:03.531 --> 22:04.611
Well, he ain't
gonna tell me.

22:04.782 --> 22:09.321
I sort of need you
to acquire the list...

22:10.746 --> 22:12.156
Discretely.

22:13.916 --> 22:19.036
The head of G.D. Security
wants me to hack
classified D.O.D. files?

22:19.797 --> 22:21.708
(CHUCKLES)
I didn't say that.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.006
Please. Do this for me.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.087
Can you tell me
why you need it?

22:26.262 --> 22:28.093
Hmm... The less
you know, the better.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.174
You're protecting me.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.054
Same here.
Hey, Zane... Hey.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.806
No. You're
a straight arrow.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.593
That's what I love
and kinda hate about you.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.057
I'm not gonna be
the one that gets
your hands dirty here.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.688
I'm sorry, Jo.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.908
ALLISON: Holly?

22:53.581 --> 22:54.821
Hello?

23:05.426 --> 23:06.461
What are you doing?

23:06.635 --> 23:07.841
COMPUTER: Beta sample.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.719
Cellular lattice
47% percent printed.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.596
47% of what?

23:25.654 --> 23:26.905
Hi.

23:27.990 --> 23:28.900
What are you
doing here?

23:29.074 --> 23:30.325
Just checking in.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.235
Oh, Doug sent you.
It's sweet, but he
worries too much.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.277
(TYPING)

23:36.957 --> 23:38.743
Well, he is the boss.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.628
But just so
I have something
to report back...

23:41.795 --> 23:43.535
Everything's good?

23:43.714 --> 23:45.625
Yeah. Keeping busy.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.084
I can see that.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.000
Oh! That's not for me.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.885
I mean,
it's for me to study.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.671
Not to live in.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.137
I'm testing
new molecular scaffolding
for bio-printed organs.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.426
In there?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.970
Seemed smarter than
running tests on myself.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.729
I wouldn't want
to melt my own head.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.140
Again.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.434
Holly, don't you think
it's a little early
in your research

24:06.612 --> 24:08.978
for you to be printing
whole human bodies?

24:09.156 --> 24:11.238
I mean,
yesterday you were
a rocket scientist.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.032
And the day before that,
I was dead.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.119
Why run simulations when
I can test the real thing?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.372
Holly, the somatic cell
emulsions you're using

24:20.542 --> 24:22.954
are incredibly hard
to produce,
even here at G.D.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.379
I guess you're right.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.460
Except the boss,

24:29.635 --> 24:31.626
who also happens
to be my boyfriend,

24:34.014 --> 24:35.220
So...

24:36.225 --> 24:38.466
I'm actually
kind of busy here.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.019
So,bye.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.644
Oh. Well, um...

24:46.735 --> 24:48.020
lguess
I'll leave you to it.

25:07.798 --> 25:08.878
CARTER: Fargo?

25:09.049 --> 25:10.710
Any luck finding
who stole the control unit?

25:10.884 --> 25:12.215
Uh, no.
Nothing.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.422
We've interviewed
108 people so far.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.052
Hundred and six, boss.
Hundred and six people.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.464
And the fact that
we haven't made
any headway whatsoever

25:18.642 --> 25:20.098
does not get me
down at all.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.597
You didn't get
my update, Doctor?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.272
What? No.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.481
The communications grid
is bonkers.
(BEEPING)

25:27.651 --> 25:28.731
The servers
should be next.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.858
Please tell me you have
this thing fixed.

25:31.780 --> 25:36.695
The Smart Dust
should be re-coalescing
at optimal altitude now.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.033
Fargo for the win!

25:40.372 --> 25:41.703
ANDY: Hmm.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.658
Doesn't seem to be
connecting with
the Smart Dust there.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.627
Oh, there's some sort
of crosstalk interference.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.129
Only one other thing
uses the same
Gaussian wave packets.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.374
Oh. Let me guess.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.631
The missing
control unit.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.472
I had this happen!
I had this happen once
with a garage door opener.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.507
Well, wherever it is,
it's still on.

26:02.686 --> 26:06.053
But maybe I can
install a booster to
override the interference.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.391
Well, the Methane
Abatement team
is waiting on us.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.025
They're over
in Dr. Glenn's
cow pasture.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.312
Oh! More suspects?

26:14.490 --> 26:16.071
There's got to be
an easier way
to find this thing

26:16.241 --> 26:18.618
than wading
through cow methane.

26:18.786 --> 26:19.650
I ran the numbers.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.614
This approach still has
the highest likelihood
ofsuccess.

26:21.789 --> 26:25.031
Any other method
would be dangerously close
to professional malpractice.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.037
Boss.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.576
Hmm.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.455
Let's go.
Great.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.339
What about that
garage door thing?

26:34.510 --> 26:35.499
I mean, there was
a house on the street

26:35.677 --> 26:37.178
and they had theirs
tuned to the same
channel as ours.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.007
And I had to drive up
and down the street
with the clicker

26:39.181 --> 26:40.546
until their door opened.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.930
Can we make
one of those?

26:42.935 --> 26:44.141
A clicker?
Sort of.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.097
Like something
that can track down

26:46.271 --> 26:47.647
where interference
is coming from.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.771
(CHUCKLES) Well,
it's a nifty idea, boss.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.853
But kind of impossible.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.858
We'd have to rewrite
the second law
of thermodynamics.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.530
And if you wanted to use
d'Alembert's formula

26:55.697 --> 26:56.903
for solving
a one-dimensional
wave equation...

26:57.074 --> 26:58.780
(GRUNTS) Yeah.

27:03.539 --> 27:06.155
ALLISON: So, if you
can set up somewhere
near a vent,

27:06.333 --> 27:08.449
you can get started.
Okay, Doc. Yep.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.667
Hey.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.210
Hey.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.546
You are looking
very tired, my friend.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.335
(CHUCKLES) Sure.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.129
How you feeling?

27:22.558 --> 27:26.426
I just keep thinking
about Grace, and...

27:28.272 --> 27:30.183
I don't know
what to do.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.812
And I can't imagine
my life without her.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.647
Because you care
about her. We all do.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.606
(SIGHS)

27:40.784 --> 27:43.742
We are trying to track
the dispersal patterns
for the Smart Dust.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.444
Ah. Particle sensors?

27:45.622 --> 27:48.034
We've been having
power flickers, uh...

27:48.208 --> 27:51.291
Vincent's fusion generator
is probably being affected.
Henry.

27:51.461 --> 27:55.295
No, I'm happy to think
about almost anything
for a little while.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.001
As a matter of fact,
I was on my way to G.D.

27:57.176 --> 28:01.260
To see Holly.
She had some questions
about the bio-printer.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.512
She asked
would I come by.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.468
(SIGHS)

28:05.642 --> 28:09.931
If someone wanted to study
molecular scaffolding,
how would they go about it?

28:10.105 --> 28:12.938
There's tons of research
on the G.D. database.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.815
I'd build a computer model
from those specs.

28:15.986 --> 28:17.851
Would you bio-print a body?

28:18.030 --> 28:21.113
(LAUGHS) No!

28:21.283 --> 28:25.652
That'd be like
launching a spaceship
to test the zero-grav shower.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.569
Yeah, well that's
what I thought.

28:27.748 --> 28:28.783
We're talking
about Holly?

28:28.957 --> 28:30.117
Yes.

28:30.292 --> 28:33.455
She was printing
a body blank in
the neural networking lab.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.664
Why?
I don't know.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.750
But when I pressed her
about it, she basically
kicked me out of the lab.

28:37.925 --> 28:42.168
(CHUCKLES) Okay, well,
I'll see what
I can find out.

28:55.442 --> 28:58.605
Major. I thought
you weren't transferring
the evidence till next week.

28:58.779 --> 28:59.814
No choice.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.479
You've got an out-of-control
dust cloud floating around.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.149
It could damage
the magnetic media
even before it damages us.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.612
Of course.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.072
Can't be too careful.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.739
But you wanna be sure
you don't leave anything
important behind.

29:13.335 --> 29:16.327
Have you ever known me
to be less than thorough?

29:16.505 --> 29:17.995
Make sure
those are sealed.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.003
Yes, sir.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.760
I'd be happy
to review the...
the evidence list.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.591
A second pair of eyes
never hurts.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.010
I can also be
very thorough.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.175
I learned from the best.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.014
You do know this is
my investigation.

29:34.523 --> 29:37.310
Of course.
I'm cooperating.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.437
Well, thanks
for the offer,

29:39.611 --> 29:43.320
but all the information
connected to this case
is classified.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.366
Sir.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.460
How many patients
should we expect?
Could be hundreds.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.297
Make sure we have
extra neural exam kits
and portable MRls.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.922
I need to talk to you.
It's important.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.340
Okay.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.311
While I was doing
some research for Jo,

30:17.691 --> 30:19.397
I found something.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.193
ALLISON: What is that?

30:23.363 --> 30:25.979
Did the dust cause some
kind of video malfunction?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.648
That's what
I thought at first.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.032
But here it is again,

30:29.202 --> 30:30.988
slowed by a factor of 40.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.247
What the hell is that?

30:42.341 --> 30:45.549
This message was buried
in a DOC-TRAM file
on my lab computer.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.255
It was addressed to Holly.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.260
Holly?
Mmm-hmm.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.843
While she was in my lab,
there was this slight
irradiance surge.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.348
She said she didn't
see anything,

30:53.518 --> 30:56.055
but this would've hijacked
every single video system.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.435
She had to see it.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.096
Why would she lie?

30:59.274 --> 31:01.515
This is
an excellent question.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.731
One I didn't want to
ask her straight out.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.236
If her cortex is having
memory problems,

31:06.406 --> 31:09.990
confronting contradictions
in her perception
could cause pathway damage.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.275
Yup.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.785
Her new brain is powered
by a photonic processor.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.332
Rhythmic flashes
like this could act
as a neural trigger.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.536
Well, that's why
I brought it to you.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.453
The strobe patterns
look like they can cause
epileptic seizures.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.087
Well, this can't be
a computer malfunction.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.963
The patterns
are too complex.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.544
This is not an accident.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.005
Well, I'll keep
digging then.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.512
Maybe I can find
a source code.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.733
(CARTER SIGHS)

31:46.780 --> 31:48.111
Hey, Fargo.
How's it going?

31:48.949 --> 31:51.941
Ooh! Ooh, you smell,
a lot.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.609
Yes.
Methane Abatement lab.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.618
Smelly and a complete
waste of time,

31:55.789 --> 31:56.949
thank you very much.
So, update!

31:57.124 --> 31:58.989
The entire Eureka Smart Car
system went down
10 minutes ago.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.203
As did our digital links
to the outside world.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.959
Well, the good news is,
the cloud is stabilizing.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.620
It's only affecting
equipment so far.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.414
Oh! So a few more hours
of bladder control.
I'll take it.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.581
And the bad news?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.217
I can't get
my booster to work.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.721
Smart Dust,
it was supposed
to be my legacy.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.007
Now I'm just gonna
be known as
Director Screw-up.

32:17.185 --> 32:21.053
Yes. But fantastically,
they are calling it
Farmageddon.

32:21.606 --> 32:22.812
Farmageddon?

32:23.942 --> 32:25.352
That is not fantastic.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.267
This is a disaster.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.190
Oh, come on, Fargo!

32:29.364 --> 32:32.697
Get it together.
You're smart
and science-y.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.985
Not like me with
my garage door opener idea.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.203
Garage door?

32:38.582 --> 32:40.072
Yeah, it...

32:40.667 --> 32:42.999
The idea was...

32:43.170 --> 32:45.035
'Cause you know how
your garage door clicker

32:45.213 --> 32:47.704
can, like, sometimes open
someone else's garage door?

32:47.883 --> 32:50.545
So you could
make a clicker,

32:50.719 --> 32:53.461
that could
find the control unit.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.051
That would totally track
the interference.
No, actually.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.967
Andy said that
it would break, like,
100 laws of physics.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.602
Yeah, well, Andy
needs to do another
self-diagnosis,

33:02.772 --> 33:04.273
because this
could totally work.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.181
I mean, yeah,
I could tweak
a diagnostic array

33:06.359 --> 33:07.895
to capture
the interference signatures

33:12.908 --> 33:13.897
Clicker.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.326
Who says
you're not science-y?

33:26.087 --> 33:27.338
Henry?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.541
Henry?

33:31.426 --> 33:33.087
Allison. Um, I...
I'm sorry.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.593
So, I went to Holly's lab.
Everything's fine.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.345
She's fine.
Nothing to worry about.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.426
Okay. Wait, wait.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.134
Did you see how she was
using the bio-printer?

33:42.562 --> 33:43.893
Yes.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.229
Does it concern you?

33:47.400 --> 33:50.358
Chalk it up to
an overeager scientist
excited to be back at work.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.440
Besides,
she's not gonna have
very much access to it.

33:52.614 --> 33:55.401
I had it moved offsite
for maintenance.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.566
So nothing
to worry about.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.819
Henry's working?

34:02.499 --> 34:03.614
Yeah. He was just...

34:03.792 --> 34:05.657
(SIGHS)
That was really odd.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.087
But I... I guess hejust
needs a distraction.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.495
Why? What's up?
A question.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.664
Could the brainium
titanic in the dust

34:11.841 --> 34:13.923
be affecting Andy
before it affects us?

34:14.094 --> 34:15.800
The barium titanite?
Yes, that's what I said.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.927
'Cause Andy's
acting weird.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.931
Well, the dust could
disrupt the EM. signals
in his processor.

34:21.101 --> 34:25.060
But it's too weak
to be affecting
the human synaptic cleft.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.438
Okay. So it affects
communications,
computers and Andy?

34:28.608 --> 34:31.520
Yes, but that still doesn't
explain why Henry isn't
quite like Henry.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.151
And why Holly...
Holly?

34:33.321 --> 34:34.436

invent this stuff?

strange going on.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.195
Yeah.
And it's notjust
about the Smart Dust.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.446
Fargo's got a tracker
for the control unit.

34:44.624 --> 34:45.909
Let me find
the control unit.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.290
Then I can get
the communications
up and running,

34:47.460 --> 34:48.870
and then we can
deal with that.
Okay. Be careful

34:49.045 --> 34:50.956
I don't want your brain
to get all scrambled, too.

34:51.131 --> 34:52.416

Okay.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.220
Okay, this is the thing.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.130

how you see me,

35:02.309 --> 35:04.766
I do. And I like that

35:11.109 --> 35:13.395
But I am running
out of time.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.106
Shaw is taking
the evidence to DC.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.145
before the Smart Dust
can corrupt the files.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.064
Yeah, I heard.
Don't worry about it.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.569
No, today.

the right thing.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.706
Please.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.748

I'm betting the evidence
has already been corrupted.

to do with Henry.

about Henry?

You think you're
dating a moron.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.055
You said you
wouldn't do it.

35:48.438 --> 35:51.100
No. I said I wouldn't
get your hands dirty.
And I didn't.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.061
Now stop asking questions
and let me get back to work.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.023

You wanted the evidence.
We gave it to you.

from Justice.

to use a reputable

I got recommendations...

were corrupted.

is unrecoverable.

the only one stuck in there.

is trying to get out.

from the matrix?
That ain't good.
