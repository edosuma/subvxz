on never having sex with
anyone else ever again.

00:05.407 --> 00:08.235

- Yeah, that's what I said.

Not good.

00:28.923 --> 00:30.493
Worst week of my entire life.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.750
One day, we're running down
the beach in Aruba hand-in-hand,

00:32.825 --> 00:35.807
and the next, it's a text that says
"I never want to see you again."

00:36.369 --> 00:39.688
- How could he do this to me?
- (Mouths "I hate you so much")

00:39.720 --> 00:41.532

00:41.958 --> 00:44.393
I mean, I should have seen the signs.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.105
Sometimes, he would
pretend to be

00:46.144 --> 00:47.423
asleep when I started
talking to him...

00:47.523 --> 00:49.759
Dude. You just missed an epic meltdown.

00:49.806 --> 00:51.240
Apparently, Sondra got dumped.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.571
Seems fair to me.

00:52.619 --> 00:55.079
She broke his ears
and he broke her heart.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.548
Hey, really?

00:56.666 --> 00:58.657
She broke up with Dr. Mike?

00:59.561 --> 01:00.985
But they were so happy together.

01:01.043 --> 01:02.673
They just got back from Aruba.

Dude, but she was funny, and nice,

01:41.641 --> 01:43.342
and she made me feel special.

01:43.415 --> 01:44.634
Honestly, I broke up with her

01:44.688 --> 01:47.274
because I was tired of people
always giving me such a bad time.

I'm gonna go up there right now,

Well, in her case, possibly forever?

02:14.261 --> 02:17.190

I'm Roger, Ms. Perrin's assistant.

I try to remind people who I

Oh, hey. Isn't this that
cool stroller we wanted?

03:26.581 --> 03:28.901
It's from Ms. Perrin's mother.
She had it delivered to the office,

and I thought I should
bring it right over.

03:30.408 --> 03:33.518
It's advanced in design
and very comfortable.

03:34.538 --> 03:36.722
There weren't any seats
on the subway.

03:37.902 --> 03:39.542
I should go.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.065
Aw, don't you just love it?

03:44.125 --> 03:45.800
That was so thoughtful of my mom.

03:45.864 --> 03:47.942
Yeah. Mom, take our picture
so we can send it to her.

03:48.029 --> 03:50.331
Oh. Yeah, sure, okay.

03:50.388 --> 03:52.073
Cheese.

03:54.487 --> 03:58.557
All I know is that you guys are
gonna be thrilled with my gift.

03:58.621 --> 04:00.034
I mean, it is perfect.

04:00.273 --> 04:03.057
So, um, what would you guys
consider a perfect gift?

04:03.509 --> 04:06.487
Well, there is this crib
we've kind of had our eye on.

04:06.534 --> 04:08.182
Oh, yeah, a crib. Yes.

04:08.254 --> 04:10.989
I mean, a crib is way
cooler than a stroller.

04:11.048 --> 04:12.548
Consider it done.

04:12.676 --> 04:15.167
Oh, God. Is that the price?

04:15.929 --> 04:18.897
Just throw some blankets
in an old cardboard box.

04:18.930 --> 04:20.517
I mean, that's what
I did with Ben and

04:20.575 --> 04:21.862
Danny and they
turned out fine...

04:21.934 --> 04:23.467
ish.

04:23.550 --> 04:24.815
But, Mom, don't worry about it.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.409
- It's too expensive.
- No, no, no.

04:26.498 --> 04:29.932
A crib is what you want, and a
crib is what you're gonna get.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.362
God, I wonder if I'm sober
enough to sell my blood.

04:33.469 --> 04:36.706
Aw, what the hell. Whoever gets
it is gonna have a great time.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.112
Oh, dang. I gotta get me one of these.

04:41.424 --> 04:44.870
Hey, uh, I know we talked about
that crib, but it's pretty big.

04:44.944 --> 04:45.964
Where we gonna put it?

04:46.015 --> 04:47.940
Oh, well, I was kind
of assuming we'd

04:48.024 --> 04:49.856
get a new place once
the baby arrives.

04:49.929 --> 04:52.729
You wanna move?
But I love living here.

Kenny, the kitchen sink doesn't work,

none of the cabinets close, and
there's zero room for the baby.

04:57.489 --> 04:58.761
I mean, we need a new place.

04:58.792 --> 05:02.378
But the baby lives in such
a small place right now.

05:02.610 --> 05:04.636
I mean, how much room does it need?

05:04.826 --> 05:07.245
And we live so close to
my mother and my brother.

05:07.317 --> 05:08.479
Exactly.

05:08.594 --> 05:12.167

07:03.492 --> 07:05.994
He wanted to throw
it in a garbage truck.

07:06.499 --> 07:08.999

- Of course, it's safe.

07:09.466 --> 07:11.023

know if you got mad,

Anyway, the grocery store has
organic fruit but not local.

08:08.918 --> 08:09.756

Because

08:09.781 --> 08:11.061
I'm very particular
about my fruit.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.837
Especially stone fruits.
Stone fruits are

08:12.862 --> 08:14.407
harvested between
June and September,

08:14.493 --> 08:16.602

I went out with this guy the other
day, and we did not connect at all.

been at work all day.

exhausted. All I wanna do...

09:50.953 --> 09:53.860
Is sit down, kick back, and
have a nice, long dinner?

09:53.957 --> 09:55.204

that sounds amazing.
