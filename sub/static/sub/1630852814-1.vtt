00:41.416 --> 00:42.791
To the max, man!

00:42.875 --> 00:45.708
-Come on!
-Bodzio! Get him! Go!

00:45.791 --> 00:47.333
Bodzio, come on!

00:47.416 --> 00:50.125
-Come on, go.
-Michał, man. This is your car!

00:50.208 --> 00:51.458
Shift gears now!

00:51.541 --> 00:53.500
-Shift now!
-Almost…

00:54.041 --> 00:56.166
-Yeah! Yes!
-Go!

01:05.208 --> 01:08.458
-Go! Now! Yes!
-Come on!

01:08.541 --> 01:09.791
We got him!

01:39.458 --> 01:40.666
You had to do that?

01:51.916 --> 01:53.375
Dad, leave it.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.833
<i>…that Hel won't disappoint you this year.</i>

01:58.916 --> 02:02.166
<i>No clouds, side</i>-<i>shore wind</i>
<i>of 17 knots in the bay.</i>

02:02.250 --> 02:05.625
<i>This is perfect weather</i>
<i>for beginner and veteran surfers.</i>

02:05.708 --> 02:07.416
<i>Perfect weather for everyone…</i>

02:08.000 --> 02:09.833
Antoś.

02:09.916 --> 02:11.583
Waking up.

02:11.666 --> 02:13.666
Don't cry, baby. Please.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.166
We'll be there shortly.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.166
Hey, Antoś.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.125
Hello.

02:31.041 --> 02:31.916
Come on!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.166
We can do it. Go!

02:33.250 --> 02:35.416
Okay, it's starting. That's it. Go!

02:35.500 --> 02:36.375
Go, Bodzio!

02:36.916 --> 02:37.916
Sasza!

02:38.625 --> 02:39.958
Crew status?

02:40.458 --> 02:41.666
Everybody onboard!

02:51.833 --> 02:53.750
-Thanks!
-Hi.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.250
Well, hello there!

03:17.291 --> 03:18.291
How's it going?

03:19.625 --> 03:21.375
Are we blasting off?

03:21.458 --> 03:23.583
-Michał.
-Come on!

03:24.583 --> 03:25.750
Blasting off.

03:42.833 --> 03:46.250
NETFLIX PRESENTS

05:19.666 --> 05:21.041
Hello, ladies.

05:21.125 --> 05:21.958
Welcome.

05:22.041 --> 05:24.416
-Hello, Mr. Miron.
-I'm happy to see you.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.833
Welcome back.

05:25.916 --> 05:27.041
Finally.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.875
The keys are in the car.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.208
A lot has changed here.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.333
Come to Mommy. Come on.

05:34.166 --> 05:38.458
Oh my. Hello, champ!

05:38.541 --> 05:40.000
Why so sad?

05:40.083 --> 05:43.708
Do not worry.
Fortunately, I'm a tear-eater.

05:43.791 --> 05:47.125
Here's a magic trick…

05:48.000 --> 05:49.666
So yummy.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.958
I can see one more tear.

05:54.041 --> 05:55.583
So yummy.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.250
Peekaboo!

05:58.333 --> 05:59.750
Professor?

06:00.250 --> 06:03.166
Who do my beautiful eyes see?

06:03.250 --> 06:04.500
Hello.

06:06.958 --> 06:09.041
-How do I look?
-Always younger.

06:09.125 --> 06:10.916
But I can't take the credit.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.125
I live in Brussels with my husband.
But I missed you.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.833
I'll see you at supper. Bye.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

06:21.583 --> 06:25.083
But your suite is ready.
The same as always, Professor.

06:25.166 --> 06:26.375
Thank you very much.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.125
Let's go.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.625
Ania.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.541
We won't fit. I'll take the next one.

06:33.541 --> 06:35.000
Ania.

06:38.541 --> 06:43.250
I'm not sure whether it's appropriate
for an old man to hug a pretty young lady.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.875
But I don't care.
We only live once. Right?

06:45.958 --> 06:47.208
You better hug me.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.750
Sorry, excuse me. Mr. Miron?

06:51.166 --> 06:54.250
This mascot is in bad taste.
We have to get rid of it.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.166
But that boy works here every summer.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.250
The rules are different this year.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.208
What? Haven't noticed that yet?

07:02.458 --> 07:07.041
Sorry to butt in, but this bear really
saved us by amusing my little brother,

07:07.125 --> 07:08.291
which isn't easy.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.000
We wouldn't have managed without him.

07:13.208 --> 07:16.791
Just make sure he washes
and fully disinfects that costume.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.208
"Make sure…"

07:21.500 --> 07:23.291
Come here…

07:23.375 --> 07:26.750
There. We're going back. Yes, we are.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.208
Thank you. That's all.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.916
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

09:29.875 --> 09:30.708
May I?

09:33.750 --> 09:34.625
Yes.

09:41.875 --> 09:42.875
Crumb.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.000
Ania.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.583
"Crumb" is my stage name.

09:48.666 --> 09:50.208
Friends call me Janek.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.291
Hi, Janek.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.083
Thanks for that thing at the hotel.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.625
No problem.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.583
Okay.

10:02.708 --> 10:05.416
Smoking is definitely bad for your health.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.541
But…

10:10.125 --> 10:11.000
can you help it?

10:11.500 --> 10:12.708
As they say…

10:16.708 --> 10:17.958
everything cool

10:18.833 --> 10:21.833
is either unhealthy, fattening,

10:22.625 --> 10:23.833
or amoral.

10:27.916 --> 10:29.750
I like it when things are cool.

10:30.416 --> 10:33.541
But sometimes my fur stinks.
I have my ways, though.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.666
Okay, gotta go,
or that harpy is gonna kill me.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.125
Are you coming or staying?

10:44.541 --> 10:45.541
Staying.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.958
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

10:48.916 --> 10:49.916
Sure.

10:51.666 --> 10:53.541
See ya. I'm off to the kiddos.

11:26.125 --> 11:29.208
Oh, the MEP's wife is here.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.208
Alone again.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.291
Smart. Never bring food to a buffet.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.083
Gąssowski is looking good too.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.791
Yeah, he does look good.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.750
I hope I look like that at his age.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.625
But you are his age.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.666
Here come the stars of the evening.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.666
-Hel welcomes Warsaw.
-Hi, hello.

12:01.375 --> 12:05.166
I couldn't take another summer
without you guys. Really. No way.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.458
Hi, Andrzejek.

12:07.541 --> 12:09.375
-Oh my.
-Hello, Auntie.

12:09.916 --> 12:13.541
So grown up. I'm really happy to see you.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.791
I'm very happy you're here. You know?

12:16.375 --> 12:18.583
Take a seat. Next to Kuba.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.250
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.583
Well, well, well…

12:24.666 --> 12:26.500
Already done with gossip, yes?

12:26.583 --> 12:29.916
Of course. It's our favorite pastime.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.083
Do you remember the crazy things
we used to do here?

12:33.166 --> 12:34.041
Not true.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.958
-He drank the most.
-Yeah, sure.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.125
Of course.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.583
Good evening.

12:38.666 --> 12:40.541
-Is everything all right?
-Yes.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.458
My name is Miranda.

12:42.541 --> 12:45.666
If you need anything,
the waiters will come to you.

12:45.750 --> 12:46.833
Just let me know.

12:46.916 --> 12:49.250
Why don't we each start with an Aperol?

12:49.333 --> 12:50.500
Not for me, thanks.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.791
-Two more Aperols, then.
-Certainly.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.541
Come on, stop it. Really.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.166
Maruś, easy.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.375
-Stop. Now.
-Okay, all right.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.916
Listen, we have news. Good news.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.833
We have news too, but you go first.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.416
Okay, we'll go first.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.208
We are returning to Poland permanently.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.625
Thank you.

13:24.708 --> 13:27.000
The pandemic made you leave London?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.166
Not at all.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.708
And didn't it ruin you?

13:30.791 --> 13:32.125
On the contrary.

13:32.208 --> 13:36.875
I had to hire additional doctors.
We're so busy. But I can't complain.

13:36.958 --> 13:39.291
-Dad is expanding too.
-Yes.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.375
We're opening a new law firm.
This time in Warsaw.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.916
And we'll run the London office…

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Remotely.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.416
-All right, so now our news.
-Hope it's good.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.250
So our kids will miss each other.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.250
Because Ania got into medical school.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.416
King's College. Top candidate.
I'm bursting with pride.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.083
Wonderful news.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.833
And surprising.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.250
What a success.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.041
Bravo. Well done.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.083
Mareczek, come on.

14:19.666 --> 14:22.291
Of course, we'll have a champagne toast

14:22.375 --> 14:24.666
to Ania's success.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.708
-Waiter!
-Excuse me.

14:26.791 --> 14:29.500
Could we please order champagne?

14:29.583 --> 14:31.125
Thank you very much.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.916
Congratulations.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.625
You'll surely take over the clinic, right?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.333
I don't know.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.458
I've been wondering

14:45.166 --> 14:46.791
whether it's not too early…

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
Of course, you still have time.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.500
You can do a pediatric residency,
and then we'll see.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.875
Champagne for you.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.958
Ania will still have
many ideas for sure, but--

15:02.041 --> 15:04.166
Are you just going to stand, or…?

15:04.250 --> 15:05.458
Oh, there you go.

15:05.541 --> 15:07.750
She'll definitely be a great doctor.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.250
Female doctor.

15:09.333 --> 15:13.041
-Male or female, what's the difference?
-Dad, I'm a female.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.333
-My apologies.
-No, my apologies to you.

15:22.416 --> 15:24.708
-Please don't touch my daughter.
-Dad.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.166
-Are you even a waiter?
-It used to be unthinkable.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.583
Ania, are you okay?

15:28.666 --> 15:29.875
It's not his fault.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.583
-A girl accepted…
-Mr. Michał.

15:31.666 --> 15:33.583
Marek, give it a rest, really.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.583
This will never happen again.

15:35.666 --> 15:37.208
I'm truly sorry.

15:37.791 --> 15:40.208
The champagne is on the house, obviously.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.458
-At least that.
-It better be.

15:43.541 --> 15:44.750
Wait.

15:48.666 --> 15:49.666
I'm sorry.

15:53.666 --> 15:54.666
Thank you.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.458
"Thank you"?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.583
If it wasn't for you and the champagne,

16:01.666 --> 16:04.750
I probably wouldn't
have the excuse to escape.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.666
You were brave anyway.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.625
I couldn't take a second there.

16:11.166 --> 16:14.791
-You heard us?
-I didn't mean to, but I did.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.083
Waiters are invisible.

16:19.916 --> 16:21.000
I'm sorry.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.375
No more apologies or thank yous.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.416
You're safe. That's all that counts.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.333
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry. What was our arrangement?

16:31.541 --> 16:33.833
Did we have an arrangement?

16:39.750 --> 16:40.875
Good night.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.416
Ania?

16:50.791 --> 16:51.666
Ania.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.041
Did you really have
to make me look like a tyrant?

17:13.125 --> 17:16.375
Did you have
to get people involved in our… in <i>my</i> life?

17:17.208 --> 17:19.166
But we agreed that one day…

17:20.791 --> 17:22.958
That someday you'd work with me.

17:27.416 --> 17:28.625
You know I worry.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.375
You worry that I have my own opinion?

17:32.625 --> 17:35.000
It took me a long time to get one.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.833
I want you to feel safe.

17:40.958 --> 17:42.833
I do feel safe.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.500
Too safe.

17:46.083 --> 17:46.958
Antek!

17:50.375 --> 17:52.583
It's okay.

17:53.708 --> 17:57.000
-Please, it's your turn.
-I'll take him.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.291
Come here.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.416
-Will you?
-Come, baby. Want to come with me?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.875
Oh, okay. I'll wipe it up.

19:18.416 --> 19:19.708
I'll take him.

19:21.208 --> 19:25.875
-Daddy would like to eat something now.
-I'd like to eat too. Sand, sand…

19:26.875 --> 19:29.875
-Let me. I'll feed him.
-No, I'll manage. Thank you.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.083
Sorry. I was just trying to help.

19:35.166 --> 19:38.125
Listen, girls. How about yoga?

19:38.208 --> 19:40.833
Come here, sweetie. Hold on. Antoś.

19:40.916 --> 19:41.958
Yoga?

19:43.458 --> 19:44.875
You could use some yoga.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.000
But it says here this is

19:47.083 --> 19:52.000
"a special class for women
who want to find inner peace and balance."

19:52.083 --> 19:55.500
I'll find my inner peace and balance
in the deck chair.

19:55.583 --> 19:56.500
Yes.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.541
Could I please have a glass?

20:02.416 --> 20:05.666
Okay. Sand…

20:05.750 --> 20:07.500
Patrycja, why don't we go?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.916
I'd be embarrassed to go alone.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.708
No way. I'm spending my day
in a deck chair.

20:14.666 --> 20:16.333
Dad will take care of Antek.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.750
They will bond.

20:20.583 --> 20:21.791
You want to?

20:24.625 --> 20:28.041
-Here you go. You two can bond, then.
-What would you like?

20:28.125 --> 20:30.333
-Okay. Let's go.
-We'll have cheese.

20:30.416 --> 20:32.750
-Come on, let's have cheese.
-Good luck.

20:35.750 --> 20:36.958
Well?

20:37.541 --> 20:40.583
Cheese? But it has juice on it, you know?

20:43.333 --> 20:44.166
Uncle?

20:44.791 --> 20:48.208
-They're running away from me.
-No. I've sent them to yoga.

20:49.250 --> 20:53.291
Next time I'll think twice
before making a generous offer.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.208
Will you hold him? Come here.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.166
Up we go.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.833
Ania doesn't seem to enjoy my company.

21:04.916 --> 21:06.125
I didn't notice.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.625
It's been a long time.

21:10.125 --> 21:11.125
She's avoiding me.

21:11.208 --> 21:14.291
Stop being dramatic.
You see each other twice a year.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.333
Does she still play the piano?

21:21.416 --> 21:22.416
Sometimes.

21:24.708 --> 21:27.583
I think I managed to talk her out
of becoming a pianist.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.833
That life isn't for her.
Constant stress and travel…

21:32.083 --> 21:34.916
To be a true artist,
one needs a thick skin.

21:35.916 --> 21:37.333
And a huge ego.

21:38.916 --> 21:42.166
-Oh, don't…
-Please let me take care of the baby.

21:43.125 --> 21:47.791
A professional babysitter
is at your disposal.

21:47.875 --> 21:52.333
We also have
a fantastic program for our kiddos.

21:52.416 --> 21:54.666
Really fantastic. Come here.

21:54.750 --> 21:58.625
No, don't you cry. No crying.

21:58.708 --> 22:03.333
Just smile. Yes. That's it.

22:03.416 --> 22:04.708
Bye-bye, Antoś.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.041
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.125
Come with me. Yes?

22:08.208 --> 22:09.875
Hey, come on. Look.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.166
To go right,

22:40.250 --> 22:43.958
we pull with the right hand,
let go with the left hand,

22:44.041 --> 22:46.083
and move the bar to the right.

22:46.875 --> 22:50.208
To go left, just the opposite, yes?

22:50.291 --> 22:52.291
-You understand, Miss Aldona?
-Yes.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.041
But call me Aldona.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.208
So when will we fly?

22:58.625 --> 23:01.291
I think there is still time for that.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.791
Well, Michałek?
Are we going or not? What's up?

23:04.875 --> 23:07.291
-When are we starting?
-We're going, yes.

23:07.375 --> 23:10.791
Okay. Dear ladies and gentlemen,
come closer.

23:10.875 --> 23:13.291
Our team will take care of all of you.

23:13.375 --> 23:17.958
We'll explain the basic moves on the water

23:18.500 --> 23:20.666
to stay safe.

23:22.041 --> 23:24.958
We'll teach you how to use the equipment…

23:25.541 --> 23:27.166
Please join us!

23:28.250 --> 23:29.583
We're here for yoga.

23:30.166 --> 23:33.000
There's no yoga today.
Our colleague is sick.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.291
But we do have kites. Please join us.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.666
No, we have no gear or anything.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.125
But we have everything.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.625
Come on, don't make us beg you.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.041
Come on.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.916
We have to change the wet suit.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.833
-Me?
-Yes. The other way. Zipper in the back.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.166
No one told me.

23:55.708 --> 23:57.208
Bodzio, let's hear it.

24:01.166 --> 24:02.708
Let's find you a trapeze.

24:05.125 --> 24:06.500
An S or an XS?

24:07.583 --> 24:08.958
An M?

24:11.708 --> 24:12.916
Try an XS on.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.000
Put it on your back.

24:23.333 --> 24:26.166
Very good. Just upside down.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.208
-May I?
-Yes.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.291
It's best to exhale.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.125
-Okay? Not too tight?
-It's okay.

24:46.708 --> 24:47.958
Okay.

24:53.791 --> 24:55.250
Who are you actually?

24:56.333 --> 24:58.666
A surfer? A waiter?

25:05.291 --> 25:06.333
And you?

25:07.916 --> 25:10.125
Now I'm your student.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.833
Lean back, please.

25:17.833 --> 25:18.958
Is it okay?

25:19.833 --> 25:22.541
-Yes? Is it okay?
-Yes, thank you… Sorry.

25:25.041 --> 25:26.708
So, Michał, what are we taking?

25:27.916 --> 25:31.000
Take the tens. And get me a 13.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.333
-We can always switch later.
-Okay.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.416
I definitely prefer
to teach the class here.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.333
The wind is now from the north.

25:40.416 --> 25:43.625
It can be a bit cold.
I don't think you'll need these.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.833
-But we have wind.
-That's the bay?

25:47.583 --> 25:48.583
Exactly.

25:53.958 --> 25:58.125
It's quite a force, but if you control it,
it's not gonna hurt you.

25:58.791 --> 25:59.708
See?

26:00.250 --> 26:02.750
Wait. Now I'm gently flying figure eights.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.833
When you feel you're ready…

26:05.916 --> 26:07.000
No.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.875
-…take over the steering.
-For what? No.

26:09.958 --> 26:10.916
Like this.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.500
Yes. I'm letting go with one hand.

26:13.583 --> 26:15.125
Steer it.

26:16.958 --> 26:18.958
Good. With the left hand. Good.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.916
I'm letting go more and more.

26:21.958 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.208
No! Help me. Hold it, please.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.583
-Please hold it.
-Right hand.

26:30.666 --> 26:32.583
-Please hold it.
-I got you.

26:32.666 --> 26:33.500
-You do?
-Yeah.

26:34.833 --> 26:37.500
And if we want a bit more,

26:37.583 --> 26:41.166
you can start feeling
a bit more of that force, right?

27:02.916 --> 27:07.500
Do you remember that older kid
I was so jealous of?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.750
He followed you everywhere,

27:09.833 --> 27:13.250
and whenever he saw you,
he kept saying you were

27:13.333 --> 27:15.583
the most beautiful girl in the hotel.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.375
Jerk.

27:27.375 --> 27:30.083
You remember when I finally lost it

27:30.166 --> 27:33.375
and threw myself at him,
yelling you were my girlfriend?

27:48.333 --> 27:51.541
You know,
if you don't have to start from scratch,

27:51.625 --> 27:53.000
it's just easier.

27:56.125 --> 27:59.166
For example,
I can't imagine being someone else.

28:00.875 --> 28:03.208
I love the law. Like Dad.

28:39.625 --> 28:40.625
Ania!

28:41.875 --> 28:42.875
Ania!

28:49.625 --> 28:52.166
Don't dive for so long.
You know I hate it.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.875
She really is a bit strange.

29:06.958 --> 29:09.291
-What did you say?
-What? Me?

29:10.708 --> 29:11.708
Nothing.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.791
It crushed on me again.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.166
Crashed.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.458
Crashed.

29:37.083 --> 29:38.083
Done.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.750
Thank you.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.583
I don't know if you remember…

29:47.083 --> 29:48.458
When you were younger,

29:49.125 --> 29:53.583
you also used to come here
straight from the pool,

29:54.666 --> 29:57.041
wanting to be sat up on the counter and…

29:59.375 --> 30:02.708
wanting to check-in
and greet guests with me.

30:13.375 --> 30:16.166
And once your mom,

30:16.250 --> 30:19.166
when she saw you sitting here,

30:19.250 --> 30:20.875
instead of scolding you,

30:20.958 --> 30:24.500
she also hopped up on the counter,

30:25.041 --> 30:28.625
and both of you
were dangling your feet together.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.250
You should have seen the guests' faces.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.791
Mom…

30:42.500 --> 30:43.500
Come on.

30:44.208 --> 30:45.458
I'll show you something.

31:52.458 --> 31:53.750
I haven't played lately.

31:55.458 --> 31:57.458
I'm not a musician…

31:58.791 --> 32:02.041
but I don't think you can forget it.

32:09.375 --> 32:12.000
-Not by the handle.
-I know. Here.

32:12.750 --> 32:15.208
Come on. When are you gonna repair it?

32:15.291 --> 32:16.541
Stop complaining.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.375
-Can you handle it?
-Sure we can.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.583
<i>Toking time is here again</i>

32:25.666 --> 32:28.958
<i>Summer music plays in my brain</i>

32:29.041 --> 32:31.541
<i>I'll be humming wordlessly all day long</i>

32:31.625 --> 32:34.916
<i>Usually my groove is another song</i>

32:35.000 --> 32:37.583
Karol, turn up the vocals, if you can.

32:42.708 --> 32:44.958
<i>Michał, I have a question</i>

32:45.041 --> 32:47.291
<i>To you from all of us</i>

32:47.375 --> 32:49.750
<i>Could you please…</i>

32:49.833 --> 32:52.250
-"Come here"?
-Listen, man.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.833
There is this classic problem.

32:54.916 --> 32:57.041
You have the plates, but no veggies.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.708
You get me, right?

32:59.375 --> 33:01.291
Yes? You all heard it? Bravo.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.291
-Michael, nice. Thanks.
-Consider it done.

33:07.833 --> 33:11.708
<i>Oh, Mary, Mary…</i>

33:11.791 --> 33:14.291
<i>Let me wake up with no rush</i>

33:14.375 --> 33:18.208
<i>Oh, Mary, Mary…</i>

33:18.291 --> 33:21.250
<i>Turn my stuff into hash</i>

33:21.333 --> 33:24.666
<i>Oh, Mary, Mary…</i>

33:28.375 --> 33:29.416
Ania.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.083
Here you are.

33:33.541 --> 33:36.750
Listen, Gąssowski has a concert tonight.

33:37.458 --> 33:39.500
You like him, right? Your mom did.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.250
I have to stay with Antek.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.166
What is it?

33:49.791 --> 33:51.041
Excuse me.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.416
Thank you.

33:59.708 --> 34:00.666
What's going on?

34:02.750 --> 34:05.458
-Do I irritate you?
-Kuba, it's not about that.

34:06.250 --> 34:08.416
I'd prefer not to do anything.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.750
You don't have to do anything.
You just need to listen.

34:30.625 --> 34:31.625
It's taken.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.708
Where's your mother?

34:36.458 --> 34:37.458
I don't know.

34:43.208 --> 34:46.250
And Ania hasn't changed her mind?

34:46.333 --> 34:49.291
Couldn't a babysitter stay with Antek?

34:49.375 --> 34:50.625
And one is.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.625
Applause, ladies and gentlemen.

35:08.958 --> 35:14.125
<i>Where are those</i>
<i>Unforgettable house parties</i>

35:14.916 --> 35:20.166
<i>Elvis, Sedaka</i>
<i>"Speedy Gonzales" or "Diana"</i>

35:21.625 --> 35:24.750
<i>Wine under the coat, flowers in hand</i>

35:24.833 --> 35:27.041
<i>Evening, turntable, and you</i>

35:28.000 --> 35:30.500
<i>All the hits everybody knew</i>

35:30.583 --> 35:32.875
<i>Life was so worth living</i>…

35:34.958 --> 35:35.958
Are you singing?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.416
As usual.

35:38.916 --> 35:44.166
<i>Where are those girls?</i>
<i>Where is that world?</i>

35:44.916 --> 35:49.791
<i>Where are our memories</i>

35:50.916 --> 35:55.708
<i>Of those crazy, wonderful years?</i>

36:03.375 --> 36:04.416
Sing.

36:06.041 --> 36:11.041
<i>Where are those</i>
<i>Unforgettable house parties?</i>

36:38.750 --> 36:40.583
Ania!

36:40.666 --> 36:41.916
Ania, wait.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.291
Ania, come on.

36:44.875 --> 36:45.875
Ania!

37:05.375 --> 37:06.250
Ania!

37:09.833 --> 37:11.833
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm glad you're here.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.541
You know some of the crew. Maniana.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.125
-Hi.
-Hiya.

37:17.208 --> 37:18.166
-Bodzio.
-Hiya.

37:18.250 --> 37:19.250
Hi.

37:20.458 --> 37:22.125
My girlfriend, Kalina.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.583
-Kalina.
-Hi. Ania.

37:23.666 --> 37:24.708
And this is Sasza.

37:25.916 --> 37:26.791
Ania.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.375
Our student from the hotel.

37:29.458 --> 37:31.333
A girl from the hotel? Brave.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.791
Sasza is from Ukraine.

37:33.875 --> 37:36.458
She lives here, studies in Tricity.

37:36.541 --> 37:38.000
And she's Michał's friend.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.750
Our friend, actually.
Awesome at kitesurfing.

37:40.833 --> 37:43.958
She's even better than Maniana and Bodzio.

37:44.666 --> 37:45.666
Howdy.

37:47.583 --> 37:48.916
So this is what's up.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.833
We have here, I have here,
we have here, my good friend Mateusz

37:52.916 --> 37:55.583
with his band, Bitamina.
Ever heard of them?

37:59.666 --> 38:01.416
And I have Michał here.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.041
He's not in Bitamina.
Have you heard of him?

38:04.875 --> 38:06.083
No…

38:07.458 --> 38:09.208
Okay. Ready?

38:16.375 --> 38:17.791
Here you go.

38:20.541 --> 38:22.958
Dude, so these are the moves. Look.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.125
And…

38:35.333 --> 38:37.083
Come on, let me know you're here.

38:39.916 --> 38:41.125
That's it.

38:46.458 --> 38:51.416
<i>I go into a place</i>
<i>Where the queue is split in two</i>

38:51.500 --> 38:56.791
<i>The second part goes around the corner</i>
<i>But that doesn't concern me, no</i>

38:56.875 --> 38:58.958
<i>I go in when I want</i>

38:59.666 --> 39:02.833
<i>With that dough I go when I want</i>

39:02.916 --> 39:06.208
<i>Nobody elbows me</i>
<i>I have a lot of space</i>

39:06.291 --> 39:10.333
<i>No, it's no miracle</i>
<i>I get my drink in a couple of seconds</i>

39:11.083 --> 39:14.166
<i>I think the bartender recognizes my face</i>

39:14.250 --> 39:16.625
<i>He saw it in a music video</i>

39:16.708 --> 39:19.041
<i>And here I am up close</i>

39:20.666 --> 39:23.250
<i>And here I am up close</i>

39:24.708 --> 39:27.208
<i>And here I am up close</i>

39:29.125 --> 39:31.125
<i>And here I am up close</i>

39:35.625 --> 39:39.291
<i>I spill onto the dance floor like hot wax</i>

39:39.375 --> 39:42.958
<i>I throw a punch</i>
<i>Two steps to the side, turn</i>

40:00.625 --> 40:04.125
<i>You caught my eye</i>
<i>And you'd better give it back</i>

40:04.791 --> 40:06.750
<i>No place for you in it</i>

40:08.208 --> 40:11.666
<i>Call me Pablo</i>
<i>No, today call me Stavros</i>

40:11.750 --> 40:15.833
<i>Let's drink retsina from your navel, </i>opa

40:15.916 --> 40:17.875
<i>I'm getting into it</i>

40:18.583 --> 40:21.125
<i>You're so beautiful</i>

40:21.208 --> 40:23.750
<i>I like it</i>
<i>The rest when we get out of the club</i>

40:23.833 --> 40:25.958
<i>Maybe we'll take an</i> <i>Uber</i>

40:26.041 --> 40:27.666
<i>Maybe by some miracle</i>

40:29.375 --> 40:31.166
<i>I'll give you my number</i>

40:31.750 --> 40:35.250
<i>And you just dance</i>

40:35.791 --> 40:39.083
<i>And you just dance, baby</i>

40:39.833 --> 40:43.208
<i>And you just dance</i>

40:44.083 --> 40:45.958
<i>You just dance</i>

40:47.208 --> 40:48.416
Niko.

40:54.875 --> 40:57.125
Easy. She's like that chick last year.

40:57.208 --> 41:00.250
You'll be gluing
your broken heart together again.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.250
She's different.

41:01.333 --> 41:05.500
Just like every chick from the hotel.
Get it? Different from us.

41:20.333 --> 41:21.458
Maniana!

41:21.541 --> 41:23.000
-All right.
-Go!

41:26.833 --> 41:28.708
-There he goes!
-Good!

41:28.791 --> 41:29.750
There he goes.

41:30.333 --> 41:33.041
Maniana, we're going surfing
in the morning!

41:33.125 --> 41:36.208
Who gets up so early to surf?

41:36.833 --> 41:37.833
Me.

41:39.125 --> 41:43.291
Man, if my class starts at 9:00 a.m.,

41:43.791 --> 41:47.291
I still have to get up at 7:30.
So that's not enough sleep.

41:47.958 --> 41:51.791
And if I get up at 5:00 a.m.,
that's also not enough sleep. But…

41:52.375 --> 41:55.250
I go surfing.
The spot is empty, the sun is low.

41:56.041 --> 41:58.083
I surf until 7:30.

41:59.208 --> 42:00.583
I have coffee at 8:00.

42:02.166 --> 42:03.541
Thinking to myself…

42:06.000 --> 42:08.208
"I've had a fucking awesome morning."

42:09.416 --> 42:10.708
And that makes sense.

42:11.791 --> 42:12.958
Want a hit?

42:13.916 --> 42:16.666
-Thanks, I don't smoke.
-Maybe it's time to start?

42:16.750 --> 42:18.458
Maybe it's time to chill out?

42:19.208 --> 42:21.791
I could use a hit. Come here. Sit down.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.125
So how about that surfing?

42:28.958 --> 42:31.666
Seven-thirty, 8:00, 9:00,
that's a bad morning.

42:31.750 --> 42:35.666
-Keep going.
-Five o'clock, 7:30, 8:00, 9:00…

42:36.375 --> 42:38.666
Fucking awesome morning.

42:40.041 --> 42:40.916
All right.

42:42.250 --> 42:43.666
I have to get going.

42:43.750 --> 42:46.166
To surf? You still have time.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.375
-Bye. Thanks.
-Bye.

42:50.833 --> 42:52.291
I'm off too. See ya.

42:52.375 --> 42:53.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

42:53.583 --> 42:54.416
Bye, Sasza.

42:55.375 --> 43:00.000
I might not look like a bodyguard,
but I can't let you walk alone at night.

44:10.083 --> 44:11.500
You scared me.

44:13.541 --> 44:14.958
No. You scared me.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.083
I had to

44:20.041 --> 44:21.208
get some fresh air.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.666
I feel bad when you disappear.

44:31.416 --> 44:32.958
And I feel bad…

44:35.708 --> 44:37.416
when you control me.

44:40.208 --> 44:41.708
I'm an adult.

44:48.125 --> 44:50.458
You're the most important person to me.

44:53.791 --> 44:55.875
I would not forgive myself

44:57.625 --> 44:59.041
if it all came back.

45:04.041 --> 45:05.250
Don't worry.

45:08.125 --> 45:10.583
I'm just tired.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.833
I know that smell.

46:24.875 --> 46:27.416
Here you are. All right.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.500
So what do we do?

46:28.583 --> 46:30.791
I will catch you, you will see.

46:30.875 --> 46:33.666
I'll catch you,
and we'll build a huge castle.

46:56.333 --> 46:57.375
Uncle?

46:58.791 --> 46:59.791
Hi, Kuba.

46:59.875 --> 47:02.583
Have you seen Ania?
I've been looking everywhere.

47:02.666 --> 47:03.833
She skipped breakfast.

47:03.916 --> 47:07.041
She was sleeping like a log.
I didn't wake her up.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.166
Ania went through a rough time.

47:18.791 --> 47:23.208
It's hard to get to her, and to get her
out of her room. But I'm not giving up.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.833
Give her some time.

47:38.416 --> 47:39.541
Antoś.

47:41.625 --> 47:44.416
Have you ever flown in an airplane?

48:06.833 --> 48:10.166
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to disturb you.

48:10.250 --> 48:11.333
I'll come back later.

48:11.416 --> 48:14.250
No, please continue.
I have to go soon anyway.

48:22.125 --> 48:23.291
Excuse me.

48:34.375 --> 48:36.375
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

48:37.583 --> 48:39.666
Thank you very much. I'm Ania.

48:40.416 --> 48:41.833
-Olga.
-Nice to meet you.

48:41.916 --> 48:43.916
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

48:45.958 --> 48:48.833
…ate some ice cream and got better!

48:48.916 --> 48:50.583
Ice cream!

48:50.666 --> 48:52.291
-How much?
-A fiver.

48:52.375 --> 48:53.916
Then no, thanks.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.500
An old man was sick, lying in his bed.

48:57.583 --> 49:00.416
He didn't eat ice cream and now he's dead.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.583
Ice cream!

49:04.083 --> 49:08.625
Boiled corn twice a week
will make your sex drive peak.

49:08.708 --> 49:12.666
For a woman, for a man,
boiled corn right out of the pan.

49:14.125 --> 49:16.750
Ice cream!

51:21.875 --> 51:23.583
Wait. Let's wipe…

51:49.416 --> 51:52.375
Take the lollipop,
so he doesn't skewer himself.

52:13.416 --> 52:15.791
Ripe fresh fruit from Southern Italy--

52:15.875 --> 52:17.708
Thank you. I'm not hungry.

52:52.625 --> 52:54.625
-Ready?
-You need to lob the ball.

52:54.708 --> 52:55.916
-Go.
-Pass it. Okay.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.000
-Take it.
-Michał, play.

52:58.958 --> 53:01.708
-Michał. Wake up, man.
-Sorry.

53:03.791 --> 53:05.000
Oh, yes! Almost.

53:10.875 --> 53:12.833
I prefer kites. Okay?

53:17.750 --> 53:19.291
Michał, what's wrong?

53:30.208 --> 53:32.750
-Come on.
-All right. Are we leaving?

54:10.916 --> 54:11.916
May I?

54:14.041 --> 54:15.083
You may.

54:18.875 --> 54:20.333
I think we have to talk.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.125
We don't have to.

54:26.416 --> 54:27.458
But we can.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.583
-You barricaded yourself--
-I did not.

54:35.541 --> 54:39.291
I understand a day or two.
But it's been a bit too long.

54:41.166 --> 54:42.500
Give me some time.

54:45.750 --> 54:46.791
Okay.

54:53.541 --> 54:54.541
All right.

54:57.791 --> 55:03.625
I can't take any more suppers
with Antoś yelling, "I want Ania!"

55:04.583 --> 55:08.625
So, you either go with me there,

55:09.208 --> 55:10.791
or I stay with you here.

55:10.875 --> 55:11.875
Your choice.

55:25.250 --> 55:27.375
-You have no conscience, do you?
-No.

55:28.791 --> 55:30.250
Just look at me.

55:31.250 --> 55:32.625
Yeah, you're right.

55:34.041 --> 55:36.250
The most beautiful girl in the world.

55:37.916 --> 55:39.666
I'm not going anywhere.

56:28.000 --> 56:28.916
Kuba.

56:29.791 --> 56:30.666
Yes?

56:31.333 --> 56:36.125
We never talked about it,
but how important are girls to you?

56:41.333 --> 56:42.333
What girls?

56:43.875 --> 56:46.541
There is only one that matters to me.

56:48.125 --> 56:52.083
Ever since we started talking,
we decided you'd be my girlfriend.

56:55.041 --> 56:57.583
Remember our wedding on the beach?

56:59.541 --> 57:01.916
Of course. We have to do it again.

57:03.041 --> 57:04.250
How about now?

57:04.875 --> 57:08.708
Well, Jakub, I think

57:08.791 --> 57:12.541
it's time for our little surprise.

57:13.125 --> 57:15.375
Kuba was waiting for the right moment.

57:15.458 --> 57:16.291
Excuse me.

57:18.166 --> 57:20.791
But you disappeared so suddenly.

57:20.875 --> 57:22.166
And now I'm here.

57:22.791 --> 57:23.791
Kuba.

57:27.250 --> 57:28.583
Ania.

57:29.166 --> 57:31.416
I can't imagine my life without you.

57:34.041 --> 57:39.250
That's why my parents and I decided
that I will not leave London.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.916
And we won't rent out our flat.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.041
You can live there with me.

57:45.875 --> 57:47.958
We will reacquaint ourselves.

58:00.375 --> 58:01.416
Ania.

58:01.500 --> 58:04.750
It seems to me
the therapy didn't work that well.

58:05.333 --> 58:07.541
Could you not make such comments?

58:07.625 --> 58:09.041
You could use some too.

58:09.125 --> 58:10.625
Sex addiction is treatable.

59:06.791 --> 59:08.625
Mom…

1:01:17.625 --> 1:01:19.583
I know it's been hard for you.

1:01:20.208 --> 1:01:21.916
I can see it.

1:01:24.125 --> 1:01:25.458
I was thinking of you.

1:01:26.208 --> 1:01:30.458
Especially since I have
a stepdaughter your age.

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:33.791
You have a daughter?

1:01:34.375 --> 1:01:36.208
You've never mentioned her.

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:41.208
How should I explain it to you?

1:01:44.958 --> 1:01:46.625
A few years ago…

1:01:48.708 --> 1:01:49.791
I fell in love.

1:01:49.875 --> 1:01:54.833
And, as an old widower,

1:01:54.916 --> 1:01:57.375
I met a beautiful woman with a child.

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:08.833
Well, I'm sorry.
I got some snot on your suit.

1:02:08.916 --> 1:02:11.208
Oh, that. It doesn't matter.

1:02:11.291 --> 1:02:14.125
I'll keep your tears as a souvenir.

1:02:16.416 --> 1:02:19.916
You know, a moment ago

1:02:20.583 --> 1:02:23.041
I saw

1:02:23.833 --> 1:02:27.750
Michał running out of the hotel.
He looked upset.

1:02:28.791 --> 1:02:32.083
You like him, don't you?

1:02:32.666 --> 1:02:33.916
He's a good boy.

1:02:34.541 --> 1:02:36.083
Very sensitive.

1:02:36.875 --> 1:02:38.125
I owe him a lot.

1:02:38.208 --> 1:02:41.583
It was he who took care of my stepdaughter

1:02:41.666 --> 1:02:43.708
when she came here from Ukraine.

1:02:43.791 --> 1:02:47.083
She didn't speak the language,
didn't know anyone.

1:02:47.166 --> 1:02:51.916
He got her into kitesurfing,
introduced her to his friends.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.375
Since then, he's been her best friend.

1:02:57.583 --> 1:02:59.541
And what is her name?

1:03:00.375 --> 1:03:01.541
Sasza.

1:03:13.375 --> 1:03:14.833
I love you, Mr. Miron.

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.916
<i>Shepherds have come to Bethlehem</i>

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.333
<i>Playing lively for the baby on a lyre</i>

1:03:28.416 --> 1:03:30.375
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>

1:03:30.458 --> 1:03:35.791
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>
<i>And peace on Earth</i>

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:37.625
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>

1:03:37.708 --> 1:03:43.000
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>
<i>And peace on Earth</i>

1:03:43.083 --> 1:03:46.791
<i>They worshiped with humility</i>

1:03:46.875 --> 1:03:50.541
<i>You, with an honest heart, oh God</i>

1:03:50.625 --> 1:03:52.416
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:57.750
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>
<i>And peace on Earth</i>

1:03:57.833 --> 1:03:59.708
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>

1:03:59.791 --> 1:04:04.625
<i>Glory in the heavens</i>
<i>And peace on Earth</i>

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.916
-And now what? Wishes!
-Wishes!

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.041
Cheers.

1:04:09.125 --> 1:04:11.291
Sasza, just a moment, okay? Sorry.

1:04:13.541 --> 1:04:15.083
All the best to you.

1:04:27.166 --> 1:04:29.625
We can't spend Christmas together,

1:04:30.958 --> 1:04:32.583
and we'd really like to.

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:36.958
That's why every July 24th we have

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:40.000
our own Christmas Eve.

1:04:40.791 --> 1:04:42.166
With our family.

1:04:49.833 --> 1:04:51.000
Michał?

1:04:57.583 --> 1:04:58.791
I'm sorry.

1:05:10.666 --> 1:05:12.166
Pass the wafer, please.

1:05:13.791 --> 1:05:16.000
We have wafers. Take them.

1:05:16.083 --> 1:05:17.458
We forgot the wafers.

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:20.333
Here you go.

1:05:26.958 --> 1:05:28.333
I wish you…

1:05:31.833 --> 1:05:33.750
I wish you'd stop being afraid.

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:40.041
Believe in yourself and in other people.

1:05:41.791 --> 1:05:45.125
People who are good,
who don't want to hurt you.

1:05:46.750 --> 1:05:48.583
I wish you'd…

1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:54.750
never have doubts
and not forget the person you are.

1:05:56.250 --> 1:05:57.291
Good.

1:05:58.791 --> 1:05:59.875
Funny.

1:06:02.250 --> 1:06:03.208
Affectionate.

1:06:03.958 --> 1:06:04.958
Smart.

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.583
Real.

1:06:14.791 --> 1:06:15.875
Merry Christmas.

1:06:23.666 --> 1:06:25.458
Hiya, hi.

1:06:25.541 --> 1:06:27.541
-Hi.
-All the best to you.

1:06:28.458 --> 1:06:29.791
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

1:06:29.875 --> 1:06:33.166
-I hope you fly in the competition.
-Oh, I will.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:35.291
-Be healthy.
-I'm glad you're here.

1:06:35.375 --> 1:06:37.041
Man, wait, because I…

1:06:37.125 --> 1:06:40.166
Wishing you health,
happiness, and positive energy.

1:06:40.250 --> 1:06:42.791
It's gonna be fine. Let it always be.

1:06:42.875 --> 1:06:47.000
-I wish you wind in your kite…
-A thousand windy roads.

1:06:52.416 --> 1:06:53.416
Thanks.

1:06:55.541 --> 1:06:58.083
Everyone, come here.

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.291
Show me that message.

1:12:03.916 --> 1:12:05.625
"Don't worry, I'm safe."

1:12:05.708 --> 1:12:08.333
"Met new friends,
we're having a good time."

1:12:09.333 --> 1:12:11.666
"Staying with a girlfriend at the camp.
It's great."

1:12:11.750 --> 1:12:13.708
"Sleep well. Will talk tomorrow."

1:12:13.791 --> 1:12:15.083
"Please trust me."

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:18.166
Here.

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:22.958
She's gone one night,

1:12:23.041 --> 1:12:26.291
but if we weren't here at all,
you wouldn't even notice.

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:29.916
Yes.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.291
"How are you, Pati?"

1:12:35.375 --> 1:12:39.333
"What have you done today?"
"How are you feeling?" "How's our son?"

1:12:39.416 --> 1:12:40.958
Stop it. You're an adult.

1:12:43.125 --> 1:12:44.750
She's an adult, Andrzej.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.833
Usually, a few months go by

1:13:05.541 --> 1:13:07.125
before I trust someone.

1:13:13.958 --> 1:13:15.625
Admit it. How did you do it?

1:13:18.416 --> 1:13:19.416
Wait.

1:13:20.916 --> 1:13:22.000
I'll show you.

1:14:02.958 --> 1:14:06.666
Mom died five years ago.

1:14:08.708 --> 1:14:09.708
Cancer.

1:14:18.958 --> 1:14:20.625
At the start of my senior year…

1:14:23.625 --> 1:14:25.041
things fell apart.

1:14:25.708 --> 1:14:26.958
I started to collapse.

1:14:27.041 --> 1:14:30.458
I couldn't study, eat, or sleep.

1:14:39.833 --> 1:14:41.291
What was your mom like?

1:14:49.333 --> 1:14:50.333
The best.

1:14:58.791 --> 1:15:00.000
Cheerful.

1:15:05.333 --> 1:15:06.458
Independent.

1:15:12.125 --> 1:15:13.125
Affectionate.

1:15:14.416 --> 1:15:15.500
Smart.

1:15:24.666 --> 1:15:27.208
She made friends with everyone
in a second.

1:15:38.583 --> 1:15:39.916
Mom was a jazz singer.

1:15:40.916 --> 1:15:42.083
She was great.

1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:48.916
Now the house is quiet.

1:16:09.583 --> 1:16:11.291
Maniana, do you have my bar?

1:16:11.375 --> 1:16:12.375
Yeah, it's here.

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:17.000
-Hop in.
-Thanks.

1:16:18.791 --> 1:16:19.666
All right.

1:16:19.750 --> 1:16:20.708
Hey, Sasza.

1:16:20.791 --> 1:16:22.125
-Get in. Come on.
-Go.

1:16:27.166 --> 1:16:29.125
Okay, chill out. We just have to--

1:16:29.208 --> 1:16:30.708
Yes.

1:16:30.791 --> 1:16:32.541
We know. We have to push.

1:16:32.625 --> 1:16:34.375
-What?
-Let's push.

1:16:34.458 --> 1:16:35.833
-Ready?
-Go.

1:16:35.916 --> 1:16:37.833
One, two…

1:16:37.916 --> 1:16:38.916
Three. <i>Opa!</i>

1:17:40.041 --> 1:17:43.125
Michał! The competition is in two days.

1:17:44.166 --> 1:17:45.250
Focus.

1:18:04.541 --> 1:18:07.250
-You remember everything?
-We'll see.

1:18:13.916 --> 1:18:15.375
Bravo!

1:18:45.083 --> 1:18:46.416
Are you having fun?

1:18:47.375 --> 1:18:49.250
Best time I've had in ages.

1:18:49.875 --> 1:18:51.208
So what happens next?

1:18:52.708 --> 1:18:53.750
What do you mean?

1:18:54.333 --> 1:18:57.666
You'll go back to your world
to have a good time there?

1:19:01.541 --> 1:19:02.583
You don't know me.

1:19:02.666 --> 1:19:07.875
Last year we also had a rich friend
like you. Michał fell in love.

1:19:07.958 --> 1:19:10.750
He went to see her.
She pretended she didn't know him.

1:19:16.375 --> 1:19:17.375
Leave it.

1:19:22.750 --> 1:19:24.500
You are a good friend.

1:19:25.041 --> 1:19:26.041
Yes, I am.

1:19:26.750 --> 1:19:29.500
And I'm scared I'll have to
get him out of a mess again.

1:19:30.208 --> 1:19:34.750
Neither you nor I know the future.
But I don't play with people's feelings.

1:19:38.208 --> 1:19:39.416
Will you manage?

1:19:49.541 --> 1:19:51.041
Let's smoke it up!

1:19:51.125 --> 1:19:53.083
-Let's… Yes!
-Let's smoke it up.

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:55.000
You couldn't be more of a bum.

1:19:55.083 --> 1:19:57.708
No, not here. Listen, Maniana. This place…

1:19:58.208 --> 1:20:00.208
-Whatever.
-Be quiet.

1:20:03.208 --> 1:20:05.208
So? Welcome back to your land.

1:20:08.125 --> 1:20:09.916
-Visit us more often.
-See you.

1:20:41.625 --> 1:20:42.625
I don't get it.

1:20:43.958 --> 1:20:45.125
What exactly?

1:20:46.125 --> 1:20:47.666
I sent you a text.

1:20:47.750 --> 1:20:50.250
-But you didn't call.
-But I did text you.

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:12.500
I do what I can not to worry you.

1:21:13.333 --> 1:21:14.458
I'm trying.

1:21:16.125 --> 1:21:19.500
I don't argue. I don't go out.
I'm here with you guys.

1:21:19.583 --> 1:21:21.250
I'm going to medical school.

1:21:26.333 --> 1:21:30.291
Dad, I can't just keep
trying to please everyone.

1:21:36.083 --> 1:21:39.583
I was so afraid of your sadness

1:21:40.166 --> 1:21:41.666
that I tried to adapt.

1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:50.500
I've gone through therapy.

1:21:56.750 --> 1:21:59.833
-Now it's your turn.
-Ania, I'm really trying.

1:22:03.208 --> 1:22:05.000
You never said goodbye to Mom.

1:22:08.916 --> 1:22:10.000
That's not true.

1:22:12.666 --> 1:22:14.041
You see her everywhere.

1:22:16.791 --> 1:22:17.791
In me.

1:22:19.541 --> 1:22:20.666
In Patrycja.

1:22:34.791 --> 1:22:36.291
Do you know that yesterday,

1:22:37.333 --> 1:22:39.333
for the first time in a long time…

1:22:43.083 --> 1:22:44.708
I was really happy?

1:22:55.791 --> 1:22:56.625
I love you.

1:22:57.833 --> 1:22:58.833
I'm here for you.

1:23:08.625 --> 1:23:09.875
Okay, so what's next?

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.000
I don't know.

1:23:17.291 --> 1:23:19.166
-It's all--
-Too fast?

1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:21.375
Too fast.

1:23:25.125 --> 1:23:26.125
Dad?

1:23:28.375 --> 1:23:29.583
Yes, honey?

1:23:33.791 --> 1:23:35.083
I fell in love.

1:24:10.166 --> 1:24:11.708
Baby wants car.

1:24:12.208 --> 1:24:13.333
Baby wants car?

1:24:13.416 --> 1:24:14.875
Baby wants car.

1:24:32.625 --> 1:24:36.041
I'd like to apologize to all of you

1:24:37.041 --> 1:24:38.416
for my recent outburst.

1:24:40.583 --> 1:24:41.875
I was surprised.

1:24:45.375 --> 1:24:47.708
But I didn't mean to offend anyone.

1:24:52.625 --> 1:24:56.208
Thank you for your offer,
but I need to think about it.

1:24:58.125 --> 1:25:01.208
Ania, but what is there to think about?

1:25:01.291 --> 1:25:03.625
After all, this is a splendid offer.

1:25:03.708 --> 1:25:04.708
Stop it!

1:25:05.291 --> 1:25:08.833
Stop arranging our lives all the time.
Get yours in order.

1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:12.166
Son, what is this behavior?

1:25:12.250 --> 1:25:13.708
You mean my behavior?

1:25:14.750 --> 1:25:16.541
What about your behavior?

1:25:16.625 --> 1:25:19.125
You keep imposing your opinions on others.

1:25:23.083 --> 1:25:24.208
Excuse me.

1:25:30.208 --> 1:25:33.750
We have an hour of peace.
Antoś is being taken care of…

1:25:34.416 --> 1:25:36.500
What are you doing?

1:25:37.041 --> 1:25:38.125
I'm packing.

1:25:39.333 --> 1:25:41.166
What do you mean? Why? Where?

1:25:41.250 --> 1:25:42.458
Because I'm leaving!

1:25:44.750 --> 1:25:48.583
-Patrycja, are you crazy? Now? In this--
-Yeah, I'm the crazy one.

1:25:49.083 --> 1:25:52.000
Your little girl acts out
in front of the guests,

1:25:52.083 --> 1:25:54.833
leaves for the night,
but I'm crazy. Fucking mad!

1:25:54.916 --> 1:25:56.708
Hey.

1:25:56.791 --> 1:25:59.750
-I talked to her--
-With no visible effects.

1:26:00.416 --> 1:26:02.583
Everybody has to tiptoe around her

1:26:02.666 --> 1:26:05.666
and be quiet,
so the depression doesn't come back.

1:26:05.750 --> 1:26:06.583
No!

1:26:07.291 --> 1:26:10.791
I'm neither a doctor, nor an artist.

1:26:10.875 --> 1:26:11.916
Sure.

1:26:14.375 --> 1:26:18.250
I don't live up to your expectations.
Just say that I don't.

1:26:20.541 --> 1:26:23.166
I'll never replace your wife
or her mother.

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:25.458
You both constantly make me feel it.

1:26:31.833 --> 1:26:33.625
Patrycja is right, Dad.

1:26:58.666 --> 1:26:59.750
I'm sorry.

1:27:04.500 --> 1:27:06.166
I'm sorry for everything.

1:27:10.416 --> 1:27:12.083
I didn't realize it.

1:29:26.125 --> 1:29:29.000
Sasza? Do you know where Michał is?

1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:32.333
You should know, shouldn't you?

1:29:37.375 --> 1:29:40.666
Come on.
Michał asked me to take you there.

1:29:58.958 --> 1:30:00.083
Thanks.

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:07.166
Five A.

1:30:07.250 --> 1:30:12.125
In the Group 5A, the contestants
are Józef Łazanka and Michał Kijowski.

1:30:12.208 --> 1:30:13.500
Let's go.

1:30:14.125 --> 1:30:16.375
Three, two, one…

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:29.250
Michał!

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:57.333
-Michał!
-Michał!

1:31:32.875 --> 1:31:34.458
-Bravo!
-Come on!

1:31:34.541 --> 1:31:35.541
Go!

1:32:05.833 --> 1:32:07.041
Michał!

1:32:23.125 --> 1:32:24.375
Come on!

1:32:44.291 --> 1:32:46.958
Michał!

1:32:49.541 --> 1:32:50.625
Michał!

1:34:03.958 --> 1:34:04.958
Ania.

1:34:45.250 --> 1:34:47.125
Dad says they still don't know.

1:34:48.666 --> 1:34:50.375
They'll call him tomorrow.

1:34:54.916 --> 1:34:56.625
Sorry, I can't sit still.

1:36:07.625 --> 1:36:09.750
They all wanted to come and get you

1:36:10.333 --> 1:36:11.750
in that piece of junk.

1:36:11.833 --> 1:36:13.625
I talked them out of it.

1:36:20.125 --> 1:36:21.583
Thank you very much.

1:36:21.666 --> 1:36:23.083
No need to thank me.

1:36:26.750 --> 1:36:29.708
I promised Ania I'd bring you back safely.

1:36:34.625 --> 1:36:35.500
Are you comfortable?

1:36:36.333 --> 1:36:37.250
Yes.

1:36:39.333 --> 1:36:40.416
Very comfortable.

1:36:46.541 --> 1:36:47.541
Thank you.

1:37:01.041 --> 1:37:02.541
He's alive.

1:37:02.625 --> 1:37:03.875
This isn't necessary.

1:37:03.958 --> 1:37:07.875
I'm the boss here. And the doctor said
I should keep an eye on you.

1:37:12.791 --> 1:37:14.625
All right, that's enough.

1:37:14.708 --> 1:37:16.625
All right.

1:37:19.125 --> 1:37:20.250
You're alive.

1:37:28.916 --> 1:37:31.583
Michał, let me know
if you need anything else.

1:37:31.666 --> 1:37:33.166
Thanks.

1:37:33.250 --> 1:37:34.500
What do we have here?

1:37:35.791 --> 1:37:37.916
-Hey, man.
-Hi. Good to see you.

1:37:41.958 --> 1:37:44.375
Yeah. Chałupy, what's up?

1:37:47.208 --> 1:37:49.250
All right.

1:37:49.333 --> 1:37:53.833
Listen. For this song, I need some help.

1:37:53.916 --> 1:37:57.375
I know there is a proven competitor
in the audience.

1:37:57.458 --> 1:38:00.083
I just have to locate him. Michał.

1:38:00.166 --> 1:38:01.166
Come up here.

1:38:01.250 --> 1:38:02.750
Make some noise for Michał.

1:38:04.541 --> 1:38:07.000
Come on, don't run away.

1:38:07.083 --> 1:38:07.958
This is

1:38:09.041 --> 1:38:11.833
a tried-and-true artist on the mic.

1:38:11.916 --> 1:38:12.958
A trusted one.

1:38:14.083 --> 1:38:15.291
We know each other.

1:38:15.375 --> 1:38:16.666
You know the lyrics?

1:38:21.958 --> 1:38:23.833
<i>What you did was a no-no</i>

1:38:24.666 --> 1:38:28.041
<i>You made a na-na-na-na-na in my head</i>

1:38:33.083 --> 1:38:34.458
<i>They tell us to run forward…</i>

1:38:34.541 --> 1:38:35.500
Sorry.

1:38:36.833 --> 1:38:38.833
Sorry, I clipped you. Sorry.

1:38:38.916 --> 1:38:39.833
<i>…be together</i>

1:38:39.916 --> 1:38:43.333
<i>Right and left, up and down</i>

1:38:43.416 --> 1:38:44.458
Boss!

1:38:45.750 --> 1:38:47.125
Will you dance with me?

1:38:48.125 --> 1:38:49.958
How about a shower first?

1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.458
<i>Show us how your people dance</i>

1:39:09.541 --> 1:39:12.125
<i>Listen to the drums, step on the twos</i>

1:39:12.208 --> 1:39:14.500
<i>Show us how your people dance</i>

1:39:14.583 --> 1:39:16.750
<i>Show us how your people dance</i>

1:39:17.291 --> 1:39:19.333
<i>Show us how your people dance</i>

1:39:24.750 --> 1:39:26.583
Hey!

1:39:32.083 --> 1:39:33.125
Come on!

1:39:33.750 --> 1:39:34.625
Ania.

1:39:37.375 --> 1:39:38.250
Can you help me?

1:39:42.708 --> 1:39:44.166
-Ania!
-Bravo!
