00:02.875 --> 00:04.083
Hurry up, Cody.

00:04.125 --> 00:05.375
Coming, sis!

FRANKIE:

00:05.417 --> 00:06.709
Hey, Cody!

00:06.750 --> 00:08.500
Hi, Frankie.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.500
I'm just--

00:08.542 --> 00:10.583
Okay. Good news first,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.583
or bad?

00:10.625 --> 00:13.000
Frankie,

00:10.625 --> 00:13.000
I have to go on a--

00:13.041 --> 00:15.166
Okay.

00:13.041 --> 00:15.166
Bad news, I guess.

00:15.208 --> 00:17.000
I like to get it

00:15.208 --> 00:17.000
out of the way first.

00:17.041 --> 00:19.792
Remember the Science Camp

00:17.041 --> 00:19.792
I applied for us to go to?

00:19.834 --> 00:21.458
I was accepted!

00:21.500 --> 00:23.125
That's not bad news.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.000
But you weren't.

00:25.041 --> 00:27.583
The good news:

00:25.041 --> 00:27.583
I talked to the camp director

00:27.625 --> 00:30.375
and if you take a catch-up

00:27.625 --> 00:30.375
math class, you're in.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.291
Um, it's okay.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.333
I've been busy with

00:32.333 --> 00:34.333
the Rescue Team lately, and--

00:34.375 --> 00:36.166
But if you don't

00:34.375 --> 00:36.166
come to camp,

00:36.208 --> 00:38.500
we'll barely

00:36.208 --> 00:38.500
see each other all summer.

DANI ( over com ):

00:38.542 --> 00:40.750
Cody! Leaving now!

00:40.792 --> 00:43.083
I have to go. But I know

00:40.792 --> 00:43.083
you'll love it at camp.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.417
Congratulations!

DANI:

00:48.959 --> 00:50.542
I'm sorry to pull you away.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.917
I know you haven't

00:50.583 --> 00:52.917
seen Frankie much lately.

00:52.959 --> 00:55.333
Yeah, she's been

00:52.959 --> 00:55.333
in the lab a lot more,

00:55.375 --> 00:57.000
and I've been busy here...

00:57.041 --> 00:58.917
But you're still best friends,

00:57.041 --> 00:58.917
right?

00:58.959 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, I guess, but--

01:01.041 --> 01:02.917
I'd hate to see you two

01:01.041 --> 01:02.917
grow apart.

01:02.959 --> 01:04.875
Grow a part of what? Ah!

01:04.917 --> 01:07.333
Like a new piece of your body

01:04.917 --> 01:07.333

What year? I'm sorry, sir,

02:53.375 --> 02:55.667
but who are you exactly?

02:55.709 --> 03:01.000
Ah, how rude of me. So sorry.

02:55.709 --> 03:01.000
My name is Jules...Verne.

03:01.041 --> 03:04.000
Pfft! Not this guy.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.333
Yeah, I'm out.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.208
Did I, uh,

03:05.375 --> 03:07.208
say something wrong?

03:07.250 --> 03:09.291
Well, it's just that

03:07.250 --> 03:09.291
there's a famous author

03:09.333 --> 03:11.834
from the 1800s

03:09.333 --> 03:11.834
named Jules Verne.

03:11.875 --> 03:15.667
Uh, no, no, no. I have written a

03:11.875 --> 03:15.667
few things, but hardly famous.

03:15.709 --> 03:18.625
I'm reading this book at school,

03:15.709 --> 03:18.625
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.041
But it's over

03:18.667 --> 03:21.041
a hundred years old.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.959
You're this Jules Verne?

03:24.125 --> 03:27.375
Uh, no,

03:24.125 --> 03:27.375
I do not recognize this.

03:27.417 --> 03:30.208
He's a fake.

03:27.417 --> 03:30.208
Even I've heard of that book.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.625
And I've never

03:30.250 --> 03:31.625
heard of any books!

03:31.667 --> 03:33.959
Well, if he really is

03:31.667 --> 03:33.959
a time traveler,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.417
he could have come from a point

03:34.000 --> 03:36.417
before he wrote the book.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.333
No way! Fake.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.542
Uh, Kade?

03:42.250 --> 03:45.875
Ugh. Time travel.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.875
I hate time travel!

03:45.917 --> 03:48.792
But how does a hot air balloon

03:45.917 --> 03:48.792
become a time machine?

03:48.834 --> 03:50.375
My balloon! Where is it?

03:50.417 --> 03:52.291
It has something

03:50.417 --> 03:52.291
very important on it.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.875
Heatwave and I

03:52.333 --> 03:53.875
brought it over.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.875
The Bots are

03:53.917 --> 03:55.875
unloading it now.

03:55.917 --> 03:59.208
Heatwave? The Heatwave?

03:59.250 --> 04:01.542
Ca va bien.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.542
Then I am not worried.

04:01.583 --> 04:04.208
Wait, you know about--?

04:01.583 --> 04:04.208
CHASE: Heatwave.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.083
I still maintain

04:04.250 --> 04:06.083
that hot air balloons

04:06.125 --> 04:08.625
are a hard-to-control,

04:06.125 --> 04:08.625
outdated Earth technology.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.417
But they're charming.

04:10.458 --> 04:14.083
Yeah, till you have to untangle

04:10.458 --> 04:14.083
the wreckage from the trees.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.375

04:14.125 --> 04:17.375
Beep. The other robots

04:14.125 --> 04:17.375
have returned.

Beep, bop, bom.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.417
Do not pretend for my sake.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.959
On a trip to our future,

04:23.458 --> 04:26.959
I met-- Uh, will meet?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.458
--very advanced, how you say,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.458
la-la-la, Cybertronians.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.000
Oui, oui, oui.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.917
Okay, one:

04:33.041 --> 04:35.917
He knows about Cybertron?

04:35.959 --> 04:38.083
Two: More advanced than us?

04:38.125 --> 04:40.166
And three:

04:38.125 --> 04:40.166
What's "wee, wee, wee"?

04:40.208 --> 04:42.458
It means "yes" in French.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.667
Rescue Bots, meet Jules Verne.

04:44.709 --> 04:47.000
He's visiting.

04:44.709 --> 04:47.000
From the past.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.041
Of France.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.625
Verne?

04:49.083 --> 04:51.625
As in Verne Device?

04:51.667 --> 04:53.709
The instrument

04:51.667 --> 04:53.709
Doctor Morocco uses

04:53.750 --> 04:55.542
to power his

04:53.750 --> 04:55.542
Chamber of Youth.

04:55.583 --> 04:58.083
You know of Thaddeus Morocco?

04:58.125 --> 05:00.041
That is whom

04:58.125 --> 05:00.041
I have come to find.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.625
We are friends.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.542
Any friend of his

05:01.667 --> 05:03.542
can polish my--

05:03.583 --> 05:05.041
Hold on, Heatwave.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.792
Mr. Verne,

05:05.083 --> 05:07.792
maybe you'd better explain.

05:11.834 --> 05:16.208
Thaddeus and I met at

05:11.834 --> 05:16.208
the London Exposition of 1862.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.125
We shared scientific findings,

05:18.166 --> 05:20.041
and soon

05:18.166 --> 05:20.041
I trusted him enough

05:20.083 --> 05:22.000
to give him one of

05:20.083 --> 05:22.000
the two prototype devices

05:22.041 --> 05:24.083
I'd been working on.

05:24.125 --> 05:27.834
But soon after, our interests

05:24.125 --> 05:27.834
went in different directions.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.750
I focused on exploration,

05:29.792 --> 05:32.458
to further the advancement

05:29.792 --> 05:32.458
of mankind.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.000
Thaddeus, it seemed,

05:34.041 --> 05:35.917
worked to advance only one man,

05:35.959 --> 05:40.875
trying to make himself younger,

05:35.959 --> 05:40.875
stronger, wealthier...

05:40.917 --> 05:42.875
I should have intervened,

05:42.917 --> 05:48.250
but I was so caught up in my own

05:42.917 --> 05:48.250
work I let us drift apart.

05:48.291 --> 05:49.458
But just this morning--

05:49.500 --> 05:51.834
Well, this morning in Paris,

05:49.500 --> 05:51.834
1869.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.583
--I received a message.

05:53.625 --> 05:57.500
Consisting only of these

05:53.625 --> 05:57.500
coordinates, and today's date.

05:57.542 --> 06:00.250
And you think the message

05:57.542 --> 06:00.250
was from Morocco?

06:00.291 --> 06:03.125
Who else?

06:00.291 --> 06:03.125
But now, without my balloon,

06:03.166 --> 06:05.667
how am I going

06:03.166 --> 06:05.667
to get back there?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.542
to give us transport.

06:20.709 --> 06:23.250
Thanks. I think.

Servo's a

Cybertronian helper-Bot.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.000
But he is pretty friendly.

06:44.041 --> 06:47.709
Friendship, young man,

06:44.041 --> 06:47.709

07:22.166 --> 07:23.875
( growling )

07:23.917 --> 07:25.208
Uh-oh.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.458
( growling )

07:30.500 --> 07:33.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

07:33.250 --> 07:37.041
Power up! And energize!

07:37.083 --> 07:38.083
( grunts )

07:39.750 --> 07:41.875
(  heroic theme playing  )

07:41.917 --> 07:43.583
( Heatwave grunting )

07:47.166 --> 07:48.166
Dad!

07:49.625 --> 07:51.917
Unh! Whoa.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.542
I guess

07:51.959 --> 07:54.542
I'm the catch of the day.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.875
( Heatwave grunting )

07:57.917 --> 08:01.208
Do marine mammals come

07:57.917 --> 08:01.208
with built-in cameras?

08:01.250 --> 08:03.125
CODY:

08:01.250 --> 08:03.125
Not usually, no!

08:10.625 --> 08:13.375
Aww. It wants to play.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.375
( whale bellows )

08:15.417 --> 08:17.250
CODY:

08:15.417 --> 08:17.250
I think he wants us

08:15.417 --> 08:17.250
to follow him.

08:17.291 --> 08:20.792
I doubt that whale

08:17.291 --> 08:20.792
is saying anything, son.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.083
( coughs )

08:26.375 --> 08:28.709
But I could be wrong.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.709
Ahem.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.750
High Tide, looks like

08:28.750 --> 08:31.750
an underwater trip.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.792
I can help you with that.

08:40.417 --> 08:43.083
( whale singing )

08:43.125 --> 08:46.500
(  majestic theme playing  )

08:50.417 --> 08:51.834
VERNE:

08:50.417 --> 08:51.834
Beautiful.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.667
The undersea world

08:51.875 --> 08:54.667
reveals herself to us.

08:54.709 --> 08:58.333
Yes, a book about such things

08:54.709 --> 08:58.333
must be written.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.250
HIGH TIDE:

08:58.375 --> 09:00.250
Detecting another ship.

09:00.291 --> 09:03.333
( whale singing )

09:03.375 --> 09:07.375
Dad, I think it's the  Nemo!

09:03.375 --> 09:07.375
Uh, what is this  Nemo?

09:07.417 --> 09:08.917
I'm guessing

09:07.417 --> 09:08.917
it's the reason

09:08.959 --> 09:10.959
you were sent

09:08.959 --> 09:10.959
to these coordinates.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.375
Hold on. We're docking.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.500
No sign of anyone.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.500
Looks like

09:22.542 --> 09:24.500
there's an upper deck.

09:26.583 --> 09:28.250
You two stay behind me.

09:28.291 --> 09:32.750
Jules. You came.

09:28.291 --> 09:32.750
I knew you would.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.834
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:34.875 --> 09:36.750
Thaddeus!

09:36.792 --> 09:42.125
Wow. Doctor Morocco,

09:36.792 --> 09:42.125
you got really old.

09:42.166 --> 09:45.250
Excuse the whale attack,

09:42.166 --> 09:45.250
Jules.

09:45.291 --> 09:48.125
Had I known

09:45.291 --> 09:48.125
it was you onboard,

09:48.166 --> 09:51.583
I'd never have

09:48.166 --> 09:51.583
put the ship in danger.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.750
Why would you want to put

09:51.625 --> 09:54.750
anyone in danger, Thaddeus?

09:54.792 --> 10:00.291
I have a history with this

09:54.792 --> 10:00.291
family and their robots.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.458
But come, Embrace me.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.667
I have missed you,  mon ami.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.750
Sorry to interrupt

10:06.709 --> 10:08.750
the reunion,

10:08.792 --> 10:10.667
but you're coming with us,

10:08.792 --> 10:10.667
Morocco.

10:10.709 --> 10:15.041
Chief Burns.

10:10.709 --> 10:15.041
Delightful as ever.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.834
Come to slap the irons

10:15.083 --> 10:17.834
on me?

10:17.875 --> 10:20.500
How did you even get

10:17.875 --> 10:20.500
this submarine back?

10:20.542 --> 10:24.000
I was forced

10:20.542 --> 10:24.000
to trade my Verne Device

10:24.041 --> 10:27.834
to the Pynch woman

10:24.041 --> 10:27.834
for the return of my ship.

10:27.875 --> 10:32.625
I'd intended on outsmarting her,

10:27.875 --> 10:32.625
of course, but...

10:32.667 --> 10:35.291
And without the device you

10:32.667 --> 10:35.291
can't run your Chamber of Youth.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.500
Bright as ever, aren't we?

10:38.542 --> 10:42.333
But before I surrendered

10:38.542 --> 10:42.333
the device,

10:42.375 --> 10:44.458
I took a chance.

10:44.500 --> 10:49.667
Though I lack the energy source

10:44.500 --> 10:49.667
to send myself through time,

10:49.709 --> 10:53.208
I wagered--

10:49.709 --> 10:53.208
Apparently correctly.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.125
--that there was enough power

10:53.250 --> 10:56.125
to deliver a piece of paper.

10:56.166 --> 10:59.458
Heh-heh.

10:56.166 --> 10:59.458
A message to the past.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.709
And my old friend.

11:02.750 --> 11:07.458
And my very oldest friend.

11:02.750 --> 11:07.458
Over 140 years.  Incroyable!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.792
I used my device

11:07.500 --> 11:09.792
to travel through time,

11:09.834 --> 11:12.208
you used yours to defy it.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.709
I could have traveled

11:12.250 --> 11:15.709
through time as well.

11:15.750 --> 11:20.333
If only you had shared

11:15.750 --> 11:20.333
your energy source with me.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.667
You know I took an oath

11:20.375 --> 11:23.667
to never reveal that secret.

11:23.709 --> 11:26.750
All that matters

11:23.709 --> 11:26.750
is that you came.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.208
And with your device,

11:29.250 --> 11:35.750
I can operate my Chamber

11:29.250 --> 11:35.750
of Youth and save my life.

11:35.792 --> 11:38.542
Certainement.

11:35.792 --> 11:38.542
It is yours to use.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.875
Sorry, Mr. Verne.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.875
But in the present

11:40.917 --> 11:42.875
this man is

11:40.917 --> 11:42.875
a wanted criminal.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.875
What transgressions

11:42.917 --> 11:44.875
has he committed?

11:44.917 --> 11:46.875
Where do we start?

11:44.917 --> 11:46.875
There's the nanites,

11:46.917 --> 11:49.750
the MorBot, the T. rex.

11:46.917 --> 11:49.750
The weather machine.

11:49.792 --> 11:55.083
Oh, I do so love hearing

11:49.792 --> 11:55.083
my resume recited.

11:55.125 --> 11:58.375
( laughs then coughs )

11:58.417 --> 12:00.500
Thaddeus,

11:58.417 --> 12:00.500
I am disappointed

12:00.542 --> 12:03.000
at how you have abused

12:00.542 --> 12:03.000
your intellectual gifts.

12:03.041 --> 12:06.875
This is not the man I knew.

12:03.041 --> 12:06.875
Do what you must.

12:06.917 --> 12:11.041
Chief to Chase: Be ready

12:06.917 --> 12:11.041
to take a prisoner into custody.

12:11.083 --> 12:15.542
Ah. I'd hoped

12:11.083 --> 12:15.542
not to resort to this,

12:15.583 --> 12:20.792
but it's clear that force is

12:15.583 --> 12:20.792
the only thing you understand.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.625
Morocco-- Unh!

12:22.667 --> 12:25.542
I'm sure that you remember

12:25.583 --> 12:28.834
my charming

12:25.583 --> 12:28.834
metal-eating ants,

12:28.875 --> 12:33.291
that I controlled

12:28.875 --> 12:33.291
with pheromone signals?

12:33.333 --> 12:35.792
I've since improved

12:33.333 --> 12:35.792
the technology.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.500
I can now mimic

12:35.834 --> 12:38.500
the communication

12:38.542 --> 12:41.083
of undersea creatures,

12:41.125 --> 12:45.875
and, as you saw earlier,

12:41.125 --> 12:45.875
use it to control them.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.500
Guys, trouble headed your way.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.125
HEATWAVE:

12:49.542 --> 12:51.125
What kind of trouble?

12:52.834 --> 12:55.959
( ship thudding

12:52.834 --> 12:55.959
and all grunting )

12:56.000 --> 12:58.458
Earthquake! Uh, seaquake?

12:58.500 --> 13:00.417
I'm starting

12:58.500 --> 13:00.417
to hate the ocean.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.208
Rescue Bots,

13:00.458 --> 13:02.208
protect the ship!

13:02.250 --> 13:06.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:10.375 --> 13:12.917
( whales singing )

13:15.083 --> 13:17.333
( Heatwave grunts )

13:21.458 --> 13:22.875
( grunting )

13:22.917 --> 13:26.291
No creature

13:22.917 --> 13:26.291
should have this many arms.

13:26.333 --> 13:30.250
Nor use them, unh, to assault

13:26.333 --> 13:30.250
an officer of the law!

13:30.291 --> 13:32.625
( Chase yelling )

13:32.667 --> 13:34.875
Thanks, Servo!

13:34.917 --> 13:38.333
Unh! I think we might be outside

13:34.917 --> 13:38.333
our jurisdiction, Chase.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.667
( both grunt )

13:39.709 --> 13:41.083
BLADES:

13:39.709 --> 13:41.083
Here, whaley whale!

13:41.125 --> 13:43.083
Here, whaley!

13:43.125 --> 13:45.291
Give me what I want

13:45.333 --> 13:48.959
or I will

13:45.333 --> 13:48.959
destroy your robot friends!

13:50.041 --> 13:52.291
( ship creaking )

13:50.041 --> 13:52.291
Whoa!

13:53.834 --> 13:56.208
Blades, take Servo!

14:01.500 --> 14:03.750
( squid groans )

14:10.834 --> 14:14.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:14.375 --> 14:17.375
( whales howling )

14:20.041 --> 14:22.041
You win, Morocco.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.000
Call off your attack.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.000
We'll surrender.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.917
HIGH TIDE ( on com ):

14:24.041 --> 14:25.917
Not so fast, chief!

14:25.959 --> 14:27.834
That's my tender,

14:27.875 --> 14:30.667
and I have a little something

14:27.875 --> 14:30.667
to say in the matter.

14:30.709 --> 14:32.583
(  action theme playing  )

14:32.625 --> 14:34.166
( grunting )

14:42.500 --> 14:45.083
( motor whirring )

14:47.750 --> 14:51.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:02.583 --> 15:04.667
( all yelp )

15:06.792 --> 15:08.500
MOROCCO:

15:06.792 --> 15:08.500
What? That's--

15:08.542 --> 15:10.041
How did--?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.959
When did you acquire that?!

15:12.000 --> 15:15.250
Big fella, isn't he?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.250
New member of the team.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.333
Game's over, doctor.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.875
I surrender.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.041
But I beg you,

15:22.083 --> 15:24.959
allow me

15:22.083 --> 15:24.959
to use the Chamber of Youth

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
when we arrive back

15:27.041 --> 15:30.667
or I shall perish

15:27.041 --> 15:30.667
within days.

15:40.875 --> 15:44.542
Ah, back to my old young self.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.834
More time to serve

15:44.583 --> 15:47.834
your sentence with. Come on.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.125
MOROCCO:

15:56.000 --> 15:58.125
Come to gloat, have you?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.041
Of course not.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.583
Such a friendship.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.583
How did we come to this?

16:08.083 --> 16:10.000
Frankie, it's me.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.750
Mm-hmm, I can see that.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.083
Listen, I wanted to--

16:15.125 --> 16:18.000
Well, I just don't want us

16:15.125 --> 16:18.000
turning into these guys.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.959
Doctor Morocco.

16:21.041 --> 16:23.166
But who's the other one?

16:23.208 --> 16:25.667
I'll explain later.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.667
Just watch.

16:25.709 --> 16:29.125
I made my choices,

16:25.709 --> 16:29.125
as did you.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.875
We simply took

16:29.166 --> 16:31.875
different paths.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.375
No,  mon ami.

16:33.417 --> 16:36.250
There was only one path

16:33.417 --> 16:36.250
and you left it.

16:36.291 --> 16:39.542
Nonsense. My dreams

16:36.291 --> 16:39.542
were bigger than yours.

16:39.583 --> 16:43.041
I took what I wanted

16:39.583 --> 16:43.041
and I apologize for none of it.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.625
Most things, I have found,

16:43.083 --> 16:46.625
can be measured in this world,

16:46.667 --> 16:50.208
except the bounds

16:46.667 --> 16:50.208
of human ambition.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.458
I am sorry, Thaddeus.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.041
I should have tried harder

16:52.500 --> 16:55.041
to be a good friend.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.750
Perhaps if I had...

17:02.375 --> 17:04.917
Ha! So you think one of us

17:04.959 --> 17:06.959
is gonna turn

17:04.959 --> 17:06.959
into an evil villain?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.208
No, not that part.

17:09.250 --> 17:12.917
The part about best friends

17:09.250 --> 17:12.917
drifting away from each other.

17:12.959 --> 17:15.417
I decided. I'm going to take

17:12.959 --> 17:15.417
the extra math course

17:15.458 --> 17:17.500
so we can go

17:15.458 --> 17:17.500
to Science Camp together.

17:17.542 --> 17:20.417
I don't want us to end up like

17:17.542 --> 17:20.417
Morocco and Jules Verne.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.667
Thanks, Cody. Wait.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.750
That's Jules Verne?

17:22.709 --> 17:26.750
As in the Jules Verne?!

17:26.792 --> 17:28.250
I'll be right over.

17:32.542 --> 17:35.959
Balloon's repaired. She is just

17:32.542 --> 17:35.959
about ready to go, Mr. Verne.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.166
( speaks in French )

17:40.000 --> 17:41.542
Ah! Is that him?

17:41.583 --> 17:44.208
Capitaine,  I am thinking,

17:44.250 --> 17:46.834
I would like to take Thaddeus

17:44.250 --> 17:46.834
back into the past.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.375
He should serve his sentence

17:46.875 --> 17:49.375
in his own era.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.333
I'm sorry, Mr. Verne,

17:49.417 --> 17:51.333
but our facilities

17:51.375 --> 17:53.834
are far more secure than

17:51.375 --> 17:53.834
anything in your day.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.750
I'm not willing to take the risk

17:53.875 --> 17:57.750
of him escaping again.

17:57.792 --> 17:59.291
Ah,  oui.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.583
Um, Dad,

17:59.333 --> 18:01.583
you know how Morocco

18:01.625 --> 18:04.041
used the Verne Device

18:01.625 --> 18:04.041
to erase people's memories?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.125
What if we did that to him?

18:06.166 --> 18:08.834
Reset his memory to before

18:06.166 --> 18:08.834
he started being bad.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.208
( speaks in French )

18:11.250 --> 18:13.625
With no memory of his past

18:11.250 --> 18:13.625
my old friend

18:13.667 --> 18:15.041
could have a second chance.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.291
But if you take

18:15.083 --> 18:18.291
this Morocco back,

18:18.333 --> 18:21.500
his younger self is already

18:18.333 --> 18:21.500
living in your time.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.458
Can both of them be there?

18:23.500 --> 18:27.041
Sorry to interrupt, but did

18:23.500 --> 18:27.041
I mention I hate time travel?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.834
Hmm, a conundrum.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.250
I shall take him to the future.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.250
He can live there.

18:32.291 --> 18:35.709
I will visit him! We will

18:32.291 --> 18:35.709
build our friendship again.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.667
Dani, let's head back to the

18:35.750 --> 18:39.667
jail and pick up our guest.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.125
CODY:

18:39.709 --> 18:41.125
Mr. Verne,

18:41.166 --> 18:42.959
I'd like you

18:41.166 --> 18:42.959
to meet my best friend.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.959
( squeals and giggles )

18:46.000 --> 18:48.583
Is that... Energon?

18:48.625 --> 18:52.041
Oui.  My energy source. It

18:48.625 --> 18:52.041
interacts with the device by--

18:52.083 --> 18:53.959
( speaks in French )

18:54.000 --> 18:57.208
In a special way creating the

18:54.000 --> 18:57.208
ability to travel through time.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.417
Is that how you met--

18:57.250 --> 19:00.417
I mean, meet. --the Autobots?

19:00.458 --> 19:02.250
I cannot discuss the future.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.333
No one should

19:02.291 --> 19:04.333
know their own destiny.

19:04.375 --> 19:07.125
No matter how important it is.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.083
What's that about?

19:11.125 --> 19:13.625
No clue. If he has

19:11.125 --> 19:13.625
something to say to me,

19:13.667 --> 19:15.125
he should just

19:13.667 --> 19:15.125
come out and say it.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.166
Even if it is in French.

19:19.542 --> 19:22.291
Okay, doctor, time to-- Huh?

19:24.834 --> 19:26.333
He escaped!

19:26.375 --> 19:29.333
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:31.208 --> 19:34.750
Energon. Ah!

19:31.208 --> 19:34.750
His energy source!

19:36.000 --> 19:38.500
No! Thaddeus, wait!

19:38.542 --> 19:43.417
The Energon will be your

19:38.542 --> 19:43.417
final gift to me,  mon ami!

19:43.458 --> 19:44.750
( grunts )

19:44.792 --> 19:46.250
FRANKIE:

19:44.792 --> 19:46.250
Weigh the balloon down!

19:46.291 --> 19:49.083
( all grunt )

19:49.125 --> 19:52.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:52.917 --> 19:54.792
I can't hold on!

19:54.834 --> 19:57.625
( grunts then screams )

20:01.083 --> 20:03.458
Next time you attempt

20:01.083 --> 20:03.458
to stop a hot-air balloon,

20:03.500 --> 20:05.166
please assure

20:03.500 --> 20:05.166
you wear your helmet.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.083
Glad to see you too, Chase!

20:07.125 --> 20:10.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:14.500 --> 20:16.333
It's time, I think,

20:16.375 --> 20:19.291
for us to drift

20:16.375 --> 20:19.291
even further apart, Jules.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.291
What?! No!

20:22.333 --> 20:25.583
Morocco, you need

20:22.333 --> 20:25.583
to be nicer to people.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.959
A grand adventure,

20:25.625 --> 20:27.959
it has been!

20:28.000 --> 20:30.417
Merci! Au revoir, mes amis!

20:39.542 --> 20:42.125
Wish I'd asked him

20:39.542 --> 20:42.125
to sign my copy.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.709
Anyone know what

20:42.166 --> 20:44.709
"au revoir" means?

20:44.750 --> 20:47.083
It's like

20:44.750 --> 20:47.083
"till we meet again."

20:47.125 --> 20:49.834
Huh. Wonder what

20:47.125 --> 20:49.834
he meant by that.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.625
Don't you get it?

20:49.875 --> 20:52.625
You'll meet him in the future.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.542
He just didn't

20:52.667 --> 20:54.542
want to tell you.

20:54.583 --> 20:57.834
Oops. I guess I shouldn't

20:54.583 --> 20:57.834
have told you either.

20:57.875 --> 21:00.625
Okay, whoa. Whoa!

21:00.667 --> 21:02.625
Time travel.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.625
Still hate it.

21:02.667 --> 21:06.125
Do you think Jules managed to

21:02.667 --> 21:06.125
wipe Doctor Morocco's memory?

21:06.166 --> 21:07.458
Let us hope so.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.125
The future will be much safer

21:07.500 --> 21:10.125
if he is reformed.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.959
If they made it

21:10.166 --> 21:11.959
to the future.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.250
Heh-heh.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.250
I think they did.

21:14.291 --> 21:16.709
And I think they

21:14.291 --> 21:16.709
become friends again.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.792
Oh, Jules, thank you

21:19.750 --> 21:22.792
for showing me around.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.208
VERNE:

21:22.834 --> 21:25.208
It is nice to spend time

21:22.834 --> 21:25.208
with you my old friend.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.333
MOROCCO:

21:25.250 --> 21:27.333
I've always

21:25.250 --> 21:27.333
loved Paris in the spring.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.417
VERNE:

21:27.375 --> 21:29.417
Ah, oui,  Paris is beautiful.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )
