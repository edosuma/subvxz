WEBVTT

00:06.137 --> 00:07.608
HEY, STAN. WAKE UP, BOY.

00:07.608 --> 00:11.642
I'M UP. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
"THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM."

00:11.642 --> 00:15.186
WAIT, WHY DO I WANT WORMS?
I JUST GOT RID OF THEM.

00:15.186 --> 00:18.349
HEY, STAN, YOU WANNA HEAR
THE SONG WE JUST WROTE
TO WAKE UP TYLER?

00:18.349 --> 00:20.351
IT'S CALLED
WAKE UP, TYLER.

00:20.351 --> 00:22.723
ONCE WE HAD THE TITLE,
THE REST JUST FLOWED.

00:22.723 --> 00:26.427
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT...

00:26.427 --> 00:28.799
♪ TIME TO WAKE UP,
TYLER, MAKE A GREAT START ♪

00:28.799 --> 00:30.561
♪ WE KNOW YOU'RE
IN THOSE COVERS ♪

00:30.561 --> 00:35.136
♪ 'CAUSE WE HEARD YOUR MORNING
( blowing raspberries ) ♪

00:35.136 --> 00:36.307
YEAH!

00:36.307 --> 00:37.308
HEY, GUYS.

00:37.308 --> 00:40.541
SHOOT HER.
SHE WROTE THE SONG.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.413
I'M NOT HER FOR REVENGE.

00:42.413 --> 00:45.546
IT'S A BURRITO CANNON I MADE
FOR MY JOB AT THE FOOD TRUCK.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.578
WHEN A PERSON'S
BURRITO IS READY,

00:47.578 --> 00:51.082
I CAN LAUNCH IT TO THEM
ANYWHERE IN THE PARK.

00:51.082 --> 00:54.325
BURRITO CANNON! AWESOME!

00:54.325 --> 00:56.757
I'M GOING LONG! HIT ME!

00:56.757 --> 00:58.559
IT'S NOT EVEN LOADED!

00:58.559 --> 01:01.061
BUT IT'S AN AWESOME IDEA, RIGHT?

01:01.061 --> 01:05.766
YEAH, IT'S JUST A HOT CYLINDER
OF MEAT AND CHEESE ROCKETING
AT PEOPLE AT 90 MILES AN HOUR.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.838
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

01:07.838 --> 01:10.641
I'M GONNA ASK MOM AND DAD
TO GIVE ME THE MONEY
I NEED TO FINISH IT.

01:10.641 --> 01:12.303
MOM AND DAD AREN'T
GONNA GIVE YOU THE MONEY

01:12.303 --> 01:15.506
FOR ANOTHER CRAZY IDEA
AFTER THE PIE CATAPULT.

01:15.506 --> 01:17.748
I DON'T KNOW WHY DAD WAS
SO ANGRY ABOUT THE PIE-APULT.

01:17.748 --> 01:19.280
HE LOVES PIE.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.353
EATING IT, NOT BEING
KNOCKED OFF HIS BIKE BY IT.

01:24.315 --> 01:27.118
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE JOB OPPORTUNITY.

01:27.118 --> 01:29.290
SO MUCH MONEY!

01:29.290 --> 01:34.295
IT'S REALLY AN HONOR
JUST TO BE CONSIDERED FOR SUCH
A PRESTIGIOUS SPEAKING TOUR.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.566
AND THE MONEY!

01:35.566 --> 01:38.269
IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO BE
CONSIDERED FOR SO MUCH MONEY!

01:38.269 --> 01:39.630
I KNOW!

01:39.630 --> 01:41.472
AND THE THEME
FOR THE TOUR THIS YEAR--

01:41.472 --> 01:42.733
BLENDED FAMILIES.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.535
SO BASICALLY
IT'S IN THE BAG.

01:44.535 --> 01:46.177
A BIG BAG OF MONEY!

01:47.178 --> 01:49.180
NOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN CHOSEN YET,

01:49.180 --> 01:50.881
SO I DON'T WANNA TELL THE KIDS
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.884
YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S NOT
GET THEM ALL EXCITED ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN.

01:53.884 --> 01:56.447
WE WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE MONEY.

01:56.447 --> 01:57.748
HEY I NEED
SOME MONEY FOR--

01:57.748 --> 01:59.590
MONEY?! WHO SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT MONEY?!

01:59.590 --> 02:02.793
WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT MONEY!
( laughs nervously )

02:02.793 --> 02:05.526
I'M JUST LAUGHING
BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER
SAID SOMETHING HILARIOUS!

02:05.526 --> 02:07.528
( laughs nervously )
RIGHT?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.530
OH, I DID! JUST NOW!

02:09.530 --> 02:11.802
I'M HILARIOUS!
GOOD ONE, ELLEN!

02:11.802 --> 02:13.734
TELL HIM! TELL HIM!

02:13.734 --> 02:15.606
NO, NO, IT TAKES TOO LONG!
YEAH, IT'S VERY LONG!

02:15.606 --> 02:17.208
ABOUT AN HOUR,
HOUR AND A HALF.
YOU LITERALLY HAD TO BE THERE.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.739
YEAH, I MEAN, HE'S A TEENAGER.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.441
HE DOESN'T WANNA STICK AROUND
AND LISTEN TO ME SAY
A FUNNY STORY.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.813
SHE HAD TO ACT IT OUT.
SHE HAD HATS.
YEAH, I DID.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.815
WHERE'D THAT HAT GO?

02:24.815 --> 02:26.517
THEY GAVE ME THE MONEY.

02:26.517 --> 02:27.818
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

02:27.818 --> 02:29.820
ARE YOU SURE
THIS WAS OUR MOM AND DAD?

02:29.820 --> 02:32.183
I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE,
I'M GONNA TRY!

02:33.624 --> 02:36.757
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE
GONNA GIVE HER ANYTHING.

02:36.757 --> 02:40.891
DADDY GAVE ME A 20
AND MOMMY GAVE ME HER NECKLACE.

02:40.891 --> 02:44.695
OKAY, SOMETHING VERY WEIRD
IS GOING ON.

02:44.695 --> 02:48.439
THE DOWNSIDE OF THE TOUR
IS I'LL BE AWAY FROM HOME
FOR WEEKS ON END.

02:48.439 --> 02:50.901
OH, THAT'LL BE HARD,
BUT WE'LL HAVE THE MONEY
TO COMFORT US.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.345
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

02:54.345 --> 02:57.608
AND WHILE YOU'RE HOLDING IT,
MAKE IT A LITTLE NICER.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.712
All: HI!

03:03.654 --> 03:07.187
THIS ISN'T THE KITCHEN.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.360
NOT TO BE HARSH, BUT SCRAM.

03:11.562 --> 03:15.366
"SCRAM"? SHE'S USING
PROHIBITION-ERA SLANG.

03:15.366 --> 03:16.667
THIS MUST BE BIG.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.669
THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED,
WE WERE MOVING IN

03:18.669 --> 03:21.532
WITH HER FELLA
AND HIS TWO SWELL KIDS.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.535
"LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED"?

03:24.535 --> 03:26.907
HOW MANY FAMILIES
HAVE YOU LIVED WITH?

03:28.779 --> 03:30.541
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:30.541 --> 03:33.314
I WAS GOING LONG,
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO SHOOT ME A BURRITO.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.247
BUT I DIDN'T.
HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

03:36.247 --> 03:38.589
UH, LET'S JUST SAY
IF AN ANGRY CONSTRUCTION WORKER

03:38.589 --> 03:40.791
SHOWS UP WITH
A SIDE OF RICE AND BEANS,

03:40.791 --> 03:45.296
ASK FOR THE RICE AND BEANS,
'CAUSE THIS THING IS CRYING OUT
FOR A COMBO.

03:45.296 --> 03:47.298
♪♪

04:03.474 --> 04:05.015
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE HERE, STAN.

04:05.015 --> 04:07.648
MOM AND DAD ARE ACTING
REALLY MYSTERIOUSLY.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.980
WE NEED YOU TO HELP US FIND OUT
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.482
YOU UP FOR A LITTLE SPYING?

04:11.482 --> 04:12.883
DOES A PUG SNORT?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.857
THE ANSWER IS YES. YES, HE DOES.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.859
I'D LOVE TO BE A SPY!

04:18.859 --> 04:21.862
OH, OH! AND I HAVE
THE PERFECT DISGUISE!

04:21.862 --> 04:24.795
MEOW.

04:24.795 --> 04:27.938
DON'T FREAK OUT.
IT'S ME.

04:27.938 --> 04:30.541
STAN.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.704
STAN, YOU'RE WAY
OVERTHINKING THIS.

04:33.704 --> 04:35.306
JUST GO AS A DOG.

04:35.306 --> 04:38.349
OF COURSE! A DOG!

04:38.349 --> 04:40.881
WOOF.

04:40.881 --> 04:45.055
I'M A DOG. GET IT?

04:45.055 --> 04:46.957
OH, THIS IS SO EXCITING!

04:46.957 --> 04:48.989
ME, A SPY!

04:48.989 --> 04:51.862
AH, IT'LL BE
JUST LIKE THE MOVIES!

04:51.862 --> 04:53.023
ALL RIGHT, LOWER.

04:53.023 --> 04:54.865
YEP, YEP, YEP, LOWER.

04:54.865 --> 04:56.727
UH, HOLD ON A SEC.

05:00.631 --> 05:03.934
LOWER. LOWER. LOWER.

05:03.934 --> 05:07.338
OH, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

05:08.339 --> 05:10.511
SOUNDS GREAT. I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.714
HEY, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH MONTY KATHCART,

05:13.714 --> 05:15.546
THE DIRECTOR
OF THE SPEAKING TOUR.

05:15.546 --> 05:18.349
HE WANTS TO COME OVER TONIGHT,
TALK TO ME FOR A WHILE,

05:18.349 --> 05:20.791
AND DECIDE WHETHER
I'M THE MAN FOR THE JOB.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.623
TONIGHT! THAT'S SO GREAT!

05:22.623 --> 05:26.927
HE'LL MEET THE KIDS,
OUR HAPPY LOVING FAMILY!

05:26.927 --> 05:30.030
SHOULD WE SEE IF TYLER
WANTS TO SPEND THE NIGHT
AT A FRIEND'S?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.903
DON'T BE SO NERVOUS.
I'M THE ONE BEING JUDGED.

05:32.903 --> 05:34.865
OH, DON'T BE NAIVE.
HE'LL BE JUDGING ALL OF US.

05:34.865 --> 05:36.607
HE'LL BE JUDGING ME.

05:36.607 --> 05:38.769
MAYBE I SHOULD CHARM HIM
WITH A SOUTHERN ACCENT.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.611
( Southern accent )
I DO DECLARE, MR. KATHCART,

05:40.611 --> 05:42.973
IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU
IN OUR HUMBLE HOME.

05:42.973 --> 05:45.976
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SPEND THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.621
HEY, AVERY,
AM I REALLY RIGHT FOR THIS?

05:50.621 --> 05:52.983
SPYING IS FOR
SOMEONE DEAD INSIDE,

05:52.983 --> 05:54.855
SOUL-LESS, PURE EVIL,

05:54.855 --> 05:58.729
LIKE A MAILMAN...
OR A CAT.

05:58.729 --> 06:01.992
STAN, IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST HAVING
PRE-SPY JITTERS.

06:01.992 --> 06:05.436
YOU GO IN THERE,
YOU LISTEN,
AND YOU REPORT BACK.

06:05.436 --> 06:07.438
BUT I HAVE BUTTERFLIES
IN MY STOMACH.

06:07.438 --> 06:09.600
SERIOUSLY, I ATE
A COUPLE OF BUTTERFLIES.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.901
THEY LOOK DELICIOUS.

06:10.901 --> 06:13.944
THEY ARE NOT.

06:13.944 --> 06:15.506
SO, BENNETT,
IF WE GET THIS MONEY--

06:15.506 --> 06:17.047
I WANNA BUY A BOAT.

06:17.047 --> 06:18.909
A BOAT?

06:18.909 --> 06:20.781
BUT WE'RE NOT BOAT PEOPLE.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.614
THAT'S BECAUSE
WE DON'T HAVE A BOAT.

06:23.614 --> 06:26.687
I SAY WE PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS
A NEW ADDITION ON THE HOUSE

06:26.687 --> 06:28.018
WITH A PRIVATE BATHROOM FOR ME.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.160
I'M SORRY, BUT SHARING
A BATHROOM WITH YOU

06:30.160 --> 06:31.992
ISN'T REALLY HELPING
THE ROMANCE

06:31.992 --> 06:34.795
WITH ALL THOSE
UNSETTLING ANIMAL NOISES.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.127
THEN STOP MAKING THEM.

06:37.127 --> 06:38.969
YOU JUST WANT
YOUR EXTRAVAGANT BOAT.

06:38.969 --> 06:41.632
SHE'S NOT EXTRAVAGANT.
SHE IS A...

06:41.632 --> 06:43.934
OH, I'M SPYING.
IT'S HAPPENING.

06:43.934 --> 06:45.606
OH, MY PAWS ARE SWEATY.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.907
WAIT, PAWS DON'T SWEAT.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.781
OH, IT'S JUST A LITTLE
PANIC DRIBBLE DOWN THE LEG.

06:50.781 --> 06:52.943
I JUST THINK A NEW ADDITION
IS WHAT THIS FAMILY NEEDS.

06:52.943 --> 06:55.115
HONEY, I'VE ALREADY BEEN
THINKING OF NAMES FOR HER.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.647
MEOW.

07:00.851 --> 07:03.624
DID YOU JUST HEAR A MEOW?
THAT WAS ODD.

07:03.624 --> 07:09.029
IF THEY THINK THAT'S ODD,
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA THINK
WHEN I BURP UP THIS BUTTERFLY?

07:11.031 --> 07:14.064
SO, MOM SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A NEW ADDITION
BEING WONDERFUL,

07:14.064 --> 07:17.508
AND DAD SAID THAT HE WAS ALREADY
PICKING OUT NAMES FOR HER.

07:17.508 --> 07:18.509
OH, NO!

07:18.509 --> 07:19.870
AND I MIGHT HAVE MEOWED.

07:19.870 --> 07:21.772
THIS IS AWFUL!

07:21.772 --> 07:23.073
IT WAS AN ACCIDENTAL MEOW.

07:23.073 --> 07:25.045
I WAS AS SURPRISED AS ANYONE.

07:25.045 --> 07:29.920
NO, NO. "NAMING HER"?
"NEW ADDITION"?

07:29.920 --> 07:31.922
THIS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING--

07:31.922 --> 07:33.854
THEY'RE HAVING A BABY!

07:33.854 --> 07:36.687
WHY WOULD THEY NAME
A BABY "NEW ADDITION"?

07:36.687 --> 07:38.489
SHE'S GONNA GET TEASED.

07:38.489 --> 07:41.031
BY ME.

07:41.031 --> 07:45.035
A NEW BABY? THAT'S COOL!
YOU THINK THAT'S COOL?

07:45.035 --> 07:48.769
TOTALLY! THINK OF ALL THE FOOD
THAT'LL BE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR!

07:48.769 --> 07:54.505
YEAH! DROP IT ON MY FACE,
YOU FILTHY BABY!

07:54.505 --> 07:57.047
I'M NOT REALLY SEEING HOW
THIS IS SUCH A BAD IDEA EITHER.

07:57.047 --> 08:00.010
A BABY
COULD COME IN REALLY HANDY.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.953
THANKS, MY LITTLE SISTER
DOES LOOK A LOT LIKE ME.

08:06.657 --> 08:09.920
THE BABY WILL BE
A TOTAL CHICK MAGNET!

08:09.920 --> 08:11.722
AWESOME!

08:11.722 --> 08:14.064
HELLO, CHICKS.

08:14.064 --> 08:16.126
( peeping )

08:16.126 --> 08:19.199
YOU PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA!

08:19.199 --> 08:22.673
A NEW BABY IS GONNA DISRUPT
EVERYTHING IN THIS HOUSE.

08:22.673 --> 08:24.504
IT'S GONNA BE TOO NOISY
FOR ME TO STUDY,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.677
AND, TYLER,
YOU'RE THE OLDEST,

08:26.677 --> 08:29.680
SO YOU'LL BE DIAPERING,
FEEDING, AND WIPING.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.683
AND YOU, WITH THE NEW BABY
IN THIS HOUSE,

08:32.683 --> 08:34.514
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
THE CUTE ONE ANYMORE.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.116
( gasps )

08:36.116 --> 08:38.018
I THOUGHT I WAS THE CUTE ONE!

08:38.018 --> 08:39.519
I THOUGHT I WAS THE CUTE ONE!

08:39.519 --> 08:43.053
NO, IT WAS ME.
I WAS THE CUTE ONE.

08:43.053 --> 08:45.055
NO ONE IS GONNA BE
THE CUTE ONE ANYMORE,

08:45.055 --> 08:46.797
EXCEPT FOR THE NEW BABY.

08:46.797 --> 08:47.858
NEW ADDITION.

08:47.858 --> 08:49.259
MORE LIKE POO ADDITION.

08:49.259 --> 08:52.062
THAT'S THE KIND OF TEASING
SHE IS GONNA GET.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.843
OKAY, SO WHAT'S
MY NEXT SPY MISSION,

09:02.843 --> 09:04.745
SHOULD I CHOOSE
TO ACCEPT IT?

09:04.745 --> 09:07.918
WHICH BT-DUBS, I WOULD.

09:07.918 --> 09:09.580
THERE'S NO MORE SPYING, STAN.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.822
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
MOM'S HAVING A BABY.

09:11.822 --> 09:15.826
BESIDES, IF THEY SEE YOU
IN THAT RIDICULOUS COSTUME,
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA THINK?

09:15.826 --> 09:18.989
THEY'LL THINK
THEY'VE BEEN VISITED BY
A SOPHISTICATED LONDONER.

09:18.989 --> 09:22.062
( British accent )
DID YOU TALK TO MOM AND DAD
ABOUT THE BABY?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.896
NO, WE CAN'T TALK TO THEM
UNTIL THEY TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.898
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
KEEPING IT A SECRET.

09:27.898 --> 09:31.041
THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW
IS BECAUSE OF YOUR SPYING.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.573
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MY WORK CAN NEVER BE
PUBLICLY CELEBRATED.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.045
IT'S THE LIFE OF A SPY--

09:35.045 --> 09:38.879
KEEPING THE WORLD SAFE
BUT OPERATING IN THE SHADOWS.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.952
IF ONLY I WASN'T
AFRAID OF SHADOWS.

09:41.952 --> 09:44.615
NOT NOW, STAN.
I'M RESEARCHING PREGNANCY.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.957
LOOK, I'M NOT THRILLED
ABOUT THIS BABY,

09:46.957 --> 09:48.258
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

09:48.258 --> 09:49.960
WE HAVE TO BE THERE FOR MOM,

09:49.960 --> 09:51.962
SUPPORT HER,
THROW HER A BABY SHOWER.

09:51.962 --> 09:53.293
I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE BIG DEAL IS.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
MY MOM HAD SEVEN BABIES
UNDER THE HOUSE,

09:55.295 --> 09:58.298
FIVE MINUTES LATER,
SHE WAS TEARING APART
A SQUIRREL.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.131
THIS IS SERIOUS, STAN.

10:01.131 --> 10:04.304
PREGNANCY IS GONNA MAKE HER
TIRED AND IRRITABLE,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.837
AND SHE'S GONNA HAVE
TO EAT EXTRA HEALTHY.

10:06.837 --> 10:08.078
NO RAW FISH.

10:08.078 --> 10:10.911
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE LOVES HER SUSHI.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.312
BOY, I LOVE MY SUSHI.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.884
DON'T EAT THAT!

10:13.884 --> 10:16.046
AAH!

10:16.046 --> 10:16.887
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

10:16.887 --> 10:19.890
SUSHI IS NOT SAFE
FOR SOMEONE IN YOUR...

10:19.890 --> 10:21.051
AGE GROUP.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.993
YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR SUSHI.

10:22.993 --> 10:25.656
SUSHI IS A YOUNG PERSON'S GAME.

10:25.656 --> 10:27.127
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.159
START THINKING ABOUT A SHOWER.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.901
A SHOWER?

10:30.901 --> 10:32.002
( sniffs )

10:32.002 --> 10:35.335
OH, YEAH! DROP SOME MORE,
YOU FILTHY LADY!

10:35.335 --> 10:37.107
( laughs )

10:37.107 --> 10:40.811
BENNETT, YOU'D TELL ME
IF I SMELLED, RIGHT?

10:40.811 --> 10:43.974
HONEY, OF COURSE I WOULDN'T.

10:43.974 --> 10:46.677
WELL, AM I TOO OLD
TO EAT SUSHI?

10:46.677 --> 10:48.018
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

10:48.018 --> 10:50.280
YOU ARE NOT TOO OLD
TO HAVE THIS BABY.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.952
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR BABY
FROM A CATALOG?

10:51.952 --> 10:54.885
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS WORKS.

10:54.885 --> 10:57.187
BENNETT, I REALLY WANT
A NEW ADDITION.

10:57.187 --> 11:00.791
YOU KNOW, THIS DECISION
MIGHT BE EASIER IF WE JUST ASK
THE KIDS AND GET THEIR OPINIONS.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.894
NO, EVERYONE CHIMING IN
IS JUST GONNA BE MORE CONFUSING.

11:03.894 --> 11:07.097
OH, THEY HAVEN'T MADE
THE DECISION YET
ABOUT THE BABY!

11:07.097 --> 11:09.740
THE MASTER SPY
HAS DONE IT AGAIN!

11:09.740 --> 11:12.072
WHY IS STAN WEARING
A TRENCH COAT AND A FEDORA?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.144
THE MASTER SPY'S COVER
HAS BEEN BLOWN!

11:23.253 --> 11:25.315
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?

11:25.315 --> 11:27.017
SINCE I'M NO LONGER
THE CUTE ONE,

11:27.017 --> 11:28.318
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE YOUR LOOK.

11:28.318 --> 11:31.091
YOU'LL HAVE
TO FIND SOMETHING NEW.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.462
LIKE WHAT?

11:32.462 --> 11:35.726
I DON'T KNOW. TUCK YOUR T-SHIRT
INTO YOUR BELT BUCKLE.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.367
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

11:37.367 --> 11:40.030
THE "TUCKLE" IS MINE.

11:40.030 --> 11:42.032
GUYS, I'VE GOT SOME BIG NEWS!

11:42.032 --> 11:44.434
THERE IS NO BABY!
THERE NEVER WAS!

11:44.434 --> 11:45.475
WHAT?!

11:45.475 --> 11:47.137
THEY WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT HAVING ONE.

11:47.137 --> 11:49.039
THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED YET!

11:49.039 --> 11:51.441
OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC!

11:51.441 --> 11:52.943
IF THEY'RE JUST
TALKING ABOUT IT,

11:52.943 --> 11:55.045
WE STILL HAVE TIME
TO INFLUENCE THEIR DECISION.

11:55.045 --> 11:57.387
HOW?
WELL, I THINK
WE JUST HAVE TO BE DIRECT

11:57.387 --> 11:59.089
AND SAY THAT
WE OVERHEARD THEM

11:59.089 --> 12:01.051
AND WE THINK THAT
A BABY IS A BAD IDEA.

12:01.051 --> 12:02.052
LET'S GO.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.053
WAIT.

12:03.053 --> 12:04.494
IF THIS DOESN'T
INVOLVE SPYING,

12:04.494 --> 12:06.026
I'VE GOT A DEBRIEFING
I HAVE TO GO TO.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.397
WHAT?

12:07.397 --> 12:08.929
I'M GONNA GO TO
BENNETT'S LAUNDRY BASKET,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.401
PULL OUT ALL THE BRIEFS,
AND CHEW THEM UP.

12:11.401 --> 12:13.303
WHAT ELSE WOULD A DEBRIEFING BE?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.809
HEY, WHAT YOU DOING?

12:18.809 --> 12:20.270
HELPING YOU GET
THAT SPEAKING TOUR--

12:20.270 --> 12:22.943
LOTS OF NICE HORS D'OEUVRES
TO IMPRESS MR. CASHCART.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.245
KATHCART.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.317
MONTY KATHCART.

12:27.317 --> 12:30.781
RIGHT, RIGHT.
I WILL NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE
WHEN HE'S HERE.

12:30.781 --> 12:34.955
KATHCART, KATHCART, KATHCART.
I WILL NOT SAY "CASH."

12:34.955 --> 12:36.056
WHAT ARE THOSE?
CASHEWS.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.057
WAIT, I MEAN...

12:37.057 --> 12:39.930
OH, NO, THAT'S RIGHT. CASHEWS.

12:39.930 --> 12:41.932
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
PUT OUT THE CASHEWS.

12:41.932 --> 12:44.334
I'LL GO WITH WALLETS.
WALNUTS!

12:44.334 --> 12:46.997
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME CALCULATIONS,

12:46.997 --> 12:49.039
AND IF I GET THE JOB TONIGHT,

12:49.039 --> 12:52.072
WE CAN AFFORD YOUR ADDITION
WITH YOUR PRIVATE BATHROOM

12:52.072 --> 12:53.543
AND MY BOAT.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.545
WE'LL EACH GET
OUR OWN POOP DECK!

12:55.545 --> 12:58.979
HEY, THAT'S GREAT!
OH, GOOD!

12:58.979 --> 13:00.010
OH, KIDS, LISTEN!

13:00.010 --> 13:02.953
A VERY IMPORTANT COLLEAGUE
OF MINE IS COMING OVER.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.414
WE REALLY NEED TO IMPRESS HIM.

13:04.414 --> 13:06.256
CAN YOU PLEASE GO UPSTAIRS
AND CHANGE?

13:06.256 --> 13:08.989
FIRST, WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU GUYS
ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.021
WE KNOW ABOUT
THIS NEW ADDITION.

13:11.021 --> 13:12.092
YOU DO?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.064
YES, AND WE'RE NOT
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

13:14.064 --> 13:16.196
THIS IS GONNA
DISRUPT EVERYTHING.

13:16.196 --> 13:20.100
I'M SORRY, HONEY,
BUT WE'RE THE PARENTS AND THIS
IS SOMETHING WE DECIDED TO DO.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.232
WHAT EVEN MADE YOU THINK
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

13:22.232 --> 13:24.074
A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
ARE ADDING ON.

13:24.074 --> 13:27.177
THE TIMMONS JUST DID IT
AND THERE'S IS BIG.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.539
WELL, THEY ARE BIG PEOPLE.

13:29.539 --> 13:33.283
YEAH, BUT THEY JUST SLAPPED
THAT BABY ON THE SIDE
OF THEIR HOUSE,

13:33.283 --> 13:35.345
NO PERMITS OR ANYTHING.

13:35.345 --> 13:38.048
I DON'T EVEN THINK
IT'S LEGAL.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.150
IT DOESN'T SOUND LEGAL.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.092
YOU NEED PERMITS?

13:42.092 --> 13:44.324
OH, YEAH. THEY SEND OUT
AN INSPECTOR AND EVERYTHING.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.497
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

13:47.497 --> 13:49.029
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.162
THE POINT IS HOW MUCH
THIS IS GONNA CHANGE OUR LIVES.

13:52.162 --> 13:55.035
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER'S ADDITION
IS GONNA BE DISRUPTIVE,

13:55.035 --> 14:00.610
BUT WHEN MY BABY GETS HERE,
WE ARE GONNA HAVE
NOTHING BUT FUN.

14:00.610 --> 14:04.174
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S GONNA BE TWO?

14:04.174 --> 14:06.516
YEAH, WE FIGURED
WE COULD HAVE BOTH--

14:06.516 --> 14:08.578
MINE AND YOUR MOM'S.

14:08.578 --> 14:10.580
WHAT?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.422
WE EACH WANT DIFFERENT THINGS.

14:12.422 --> 14:14.084
WOULD YOU LOVE THEM BOTH?

14:14.084 --> 14:15.956
OH, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.889
SHE WILL HAVE HERS
AND I WILL HAVE MINE.

14:18.889 --> 14:20.590
I'M NOT EVEN SHARING MINE.

14:21.992 --> 14:23.633
THAT IS HORRIBLE.

14:23.633 --> 14:25.135
DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM'S.

14:25.135 --> 14:28.999
WE ARE GONNA HAVE A BLAST
RIDING MY BABY AROUND THE LAKE.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.341
MAYBE WE CAN EVEN RACE HER.

14:31.341 --> 14:33.503
WE CAN?
OH, YEAH.

14:33.503 --> 14:37.577
ONCE YOU GET HER IN THE WATER,
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW FAST
SHE CAN GO.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.110
I GUESS THAT COULD BE FUN.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.013
BUT, KIDS, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A FAMILY PROJECT.

14:43.013 --> 14:46.016
SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
HAVE TO HELP YOUR DAD
SCRAPE HER CRUSTY BOTTOM.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.289
OH, KATHCART
SHOULD BE HERE SOON.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.291
OH, OKAY.
WELL, HELP ME SET UP. HERE.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.322
DID YOU MAKE THESE?

14:52.322 --> 14:53.994
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I WANTED TO IMPRESS HIM.

14:58.568 --> 15:00.030
TWINS?

15:00.030 --> 15:02.372
THIS IS EVEN WORSE
THAN WE THOUGHT!

15:02.372 --> 15:04.334
I'M GONNA BE THE THIRD CUTEST?

15:04.334 --> 15:06.336
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT, TYLER?

15:06.336 --> 15:08.038
HEY!

15:08.038 --> 15:11.041
THEY'RE NOT EVEN GONNA TAKE
OUR FEELINGS INTO ACCOUNT.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.143
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC.

15:13.143 --> 15:16.016
WE HAVE TO PROVE TO THEM
THAT TWO MORE KIDS IN THIS HOUSE

15:16.016 --> 15:18.648
IS THE WORST IDEA IN THE WORLD.

15:18.648 --> 15:21.651
WE HAVE TO ACT OUT
AND BE SO UNRULY

15:21.651 --> 15:26.096
THAT THEY'LL REALIZE THEY CAN'T
EVEN HANDLE THE KIDS THEY HAVE.

15:26.096 --> 15:28.598
AND WE CAN DO IT TONIGHT
WHEN THAT GUY COMES OVER
THEY WANT TO IMPRESS.

15:28.598 --> 15:29.929
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.401
WE CAN BORROW
THE BIG OL' TIMMONS BABY

15:31.401 --> 15:34.464
AND SHOW THEM HOW CRUSTY
A BOTTOM CAN GET.

15:41.111 --> 15:42.272
ALL RIGHT.

15:42.272 --> 15:43.413
I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

15:43.413 --> 15:45.545
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THEY
DON'T WANT YOU FOR THE TOUR?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.047
YOUR NOT THE BEST
PUBLIC SPEAKER.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.578
THANKS FOR THE PEP TALK, HON.

15:48.578 --> 15:51.621
I'M SORRY.
I JUST WANT THIS SO MUCH.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.383
HEY, HEY, HEY.
DON'T WORRY.

15:53.383 --> 15:56.386
I'M GONNA WIN OVER KATHCART,
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR FANCY POTTY,

15:56.386 --> 16:00.290
AND I'M GONNA GET
MY LITTLE JET-DRIVE,
FUEL-INJECTED WATER ESCAPE.

16:00.290 --> 16:04.534
IF YOU WANT A FUEL-INJECTED
WATER ESCAPE, MY FANCY POTTY
COMES WITH ONE OF THOSE.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.466
AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.538
I'M STILL SHOCKED THE KIDS
WEREN'T MORE EXCITED

16:08.538 --> 16:10.370
ABOUT OUR BUILDING
A NEW ADDITION TO THE HOUSE.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.503
AND A BOAT!
I MEAN, A BOAT! COME ON!

16:13.503 --> 16:17.007
BUILDING AN ADDITION,
GETTING A BOAT,
AND THEY'RE HAVING TWINS?

16:17.007 --> 16:20.050
OH, WAIT!

16:20.050 --> 16:21.651
( doorbell rings )
OH, THAT'S HIM.

16:21.651 --> 16:24.084
I'VE GOTTA TELL THE KIDS
THERE'S NO BABY!

16:24.084 --> 16:25.585
MONTY!

16:25.585 --> 16:28.088
WELCOME!
THIS IS MY WIFE, ELLEN.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.459
SO NICE TO SEE YOU BOTH.

16:29.459 --> 16:31.161
PLEASURE.
OH, A DOG.

16:31.161 --> 16:32.662
UM, DOES HE HAVE
TO BE IN HERE?

16:32.662 --> 16:34.164
I'M ALLERGIC.
OH, NO.

16:34.164 --> 16:35.495
STAN, PATIO.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.496
DANG IT!

16:36.496 --> 16:37.497
JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.499
THE MASTER SPY
HAS TIME-SENSITIVE INFORMATION

16:39.499 --> 16:42.032
TO DELIVER, BUT HE'S STYMIED
BY A FOREIGNER.

16:43.673 --> 16:45.505
THAT IS A LOVELY COAT,
MR. CASHCART--

16:45.505 --> 16:48.038
CASHCOW--
CALFCOW.

16:48.038 --> 16:51.211
UH, PLEASE,
JUST CALL ME MONTY.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.213
OF COURSE.
THAT IS A LOVELY CASH MONEY--

16:53.213 --> 16:55.545
COAT MONEY--
COAT.

16:55.545 --> 16:57.517
UH, YES,
IT IS A LOVELY COAT.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.490
IT'S FROM THE RARE
SHORTHAIR LLAMA, THE VICUNA.

17:00.490 --> 17:02.422
MATATA.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.723
AS IN VICUNA MATATA.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.356
I WASN'T GONNA SAY THAT,
BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE LAUGHING,

17:06.356 --> 17:07.357
AND YOU'RE NOT.

17:08.498 --> 17:10.160
( Southern accent )
I DO DECLARE, MR. KATHCART,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.632
IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU
IN OUR HUMBLE HOME.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.238
PLEASE SIT.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.812
READY TO SHOW MOM AND DAD
THEY HAVE TOO MUCH
TO HANDLE ALREADY?

17:22.812 --> 17:26.376
WHEN I'M DONE,
WE WON'T EVEN
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

17:27.477 --> 17:29.179
OH, GOOD. KIDS, COME HERE.

17:29.179 --> 17:31.221
THERE'S SOMEONE
I WANT YOU TO MEET.

17:31.221 --> 17:35.455
MR. KATHCART, THIS IS CHLOE,
ARE YOUNGEST.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.387
AND THIS IS AVERY.

17:37.387 --> 17:39.289
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:39.289 --> 17:43.133
AND, UM, COULD SOMEONE
GET THE LITTLE ONE
OFF MY LEG?

17:43.133 --> 17:44.464
OH!

17:46.496 --> 17:47.497
CHLOE, STOP THAT! STOP!

17:47.497 --> 17:50.270
I'M SO SORRY, MR. KATHCART.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.701
SHE'S NORMALLY NOT LIKE THIS.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.743
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.575
( mocking )
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

17:57.807 --> 17:59.509
ARE YOU MOCKING ME?

17:59.509 --> 18:01.411
( mocking )
ARE YOU MOCKING ME?

18:01.411 --> 18:04.114
AVERY!
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?!

18:04.114 --> 18:05.415
SHE'S BACK ON THE LEG!

18:05.415 --> 18:07.587
( mocking )
OH, SHE'S BACK ON THE LEG!

18:07.587 --> 18:10.590
OH, MR. KATHCART!

18:10.590 --> 18:12.222
I'M SO SORRY!

18:12.222 --> 18:15.665
COULD WE PLEASE JUST HAVE
A NICE, RELAXING EVENING

18:15.665 --> 18:18.328
LIKE WE NORMALLY DO
IN THIS HOUSE?

18:21.201 --> 18:25.575
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY BURRITO CANNON,
MR. CATHETER?

18:25.575 --> 18:27.237
IT'S CASHCARD!

18:27.237 --> 18:29.579
CASHCOW--
CASHCARD--

18:29.579 --> 18:31.341
KATHCART!

18:31.341 --> 18:32.342
I'M TYLER.

18:32.342 --> 18:33.343
( gasps )

18:34.844 --> 18:35.845
TYLER!

18:38.218 --> 18:39.689
TYLER! GIVE ME THAT THING!

18:42.322 --> 18:43.793
OH...

18:43.793 --> 18:47.457
I AM SO SORRY, MR. KATHCART.

18:47.457 --> 18:48.458
I DO NOT--

18:48.458 --> 18:51.201
GET HER OFF OF MY LEG!

18:51.201 --> 18:55.705
CHLOE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

19:08.248 --> 19:11.721
OOH, RIGHT IN THE VICUNA!

19:13.223 --> 19:16.426
TYPICALLY,
THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
IS VERY TRYING.

19:16.426 --> 19:19.429
BUT THIS IS THE SECOND EASIEST
DECISION I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE

19:19.429 --> 19:22.862
NEXT TO HAVING THAT RUSTY SPIKE
REMOVED FROM MY SHOULDER.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.635
( mocking )
SPIKE REMOVED FROM MY SHOULDER!

19:27.537 --> 19:30.400
THE CRAZY THING IS,
UNTIL THOSE BURRITOS
FELL ON YOU,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.372
I STILL HAD SOME HOPE.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.673
YES, WELL, EXTINGUISH IT.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.475
AND GET ME A TOWEL.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.946
OH, OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY.

19:36.946 --> 19:38.308
MONTY, RIGHT THIS WAY.

19:38.308 --> 19:39.449
I'M SO SORRY.

19:39.449 --> 19:41.311
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?!

19:41.311 --> 19:42.882
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO RUIN EVERYTHING?!

19:42.882 --> 19:46.716
WHAT'S WRONG IS YOU'RE
CHANGING EVERYTHING.

19:46.716 --> 19:49.719
THIS FAMILY IS PERFECT
JUST THE WAY IT IS,

19:49.719 --> 19:53.263
WITH CHLOE AND ME
ANNOYING TYLER EVERY MORNING

19:53.263 --> 19:54.924
WITH A NEW SONG AND DANCE,

19:54.924 --> 19:58.228
AND STAN WAITING
TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO US.

19:58.228 --> 20:00.700
YEAH, WE'RE ONE HAPPY FAMILY.

20:00.700 --> 20:05.535
NOW LET ME IN!
THE ROOM IS SPRAYED
WITH MEAT AND CHEESE!

20:05.535 --> 20:10.810
WHEN YOU TWO GOT MARRIED,
IT WAS SO HARD TO ADAPT
TO THIS NEW FAMILY.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.884
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE,
I LOVE IT.

20:14.884 --> 20:17.547
BUT IT'S LIKE CATCHING
LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE.

20:17.547 --> 20:21.321
I DON'T WANT WHAT WE HAVE
TO GET MESSED UP WHEN YOU
HAVE THE TWINS.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.454
TWINS?
WE'RE NOT HAVING TWINS.

20:24.454 --> 20:25.695
RIGHT?

20:25.695 --> 20:28.528
WE ARE DEFINITELY
NOT HAVING TWINS.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.829
WE'RE NOT HAVING ANYTHING.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.431
WHAT ABOUT THE NEW ADDITION?

20:31.431 --> 20:33.603
TO THE HOUSE.

20:33.603 --> 20:36.436
WHAT ABOUT RACING HER?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.968
A BOAT. RACING A BOAT.

20:38.968 --> 20:41.571
OH.
OH.

20:41.571 --> 20:45.575
YOUR MOM AND I,
WE LOVE HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE THIS FAMILY.

20:45.575 --> 20:50.950
AND A BABY DECISION,
WELL, THAT IS NOT ONE THAT
WE WOULD MAKE WITHOUT YOU.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.953
THIS HAS DEFINITELY BEEN
THE STRANGEST EXPERIENCE
I'VE EVER HAD,

20:53.953 --> 20:57.887
AND I'VE HAD A RUSTY SPIKE
DRIVEN THROUGH MY SHOULDER.

20:57.887 --> 21:01.561
BUT SEEING HOW MUCH YOU KIDS
LOVE YOUR BLENDED FAMILY--

21:01.561 --> 21:07.497
YOUR ODD, ODD BLENDED FAMILY--
SPEAKS VOLUMES.

21:07.497 --> 21:11.601
BENNETT, IF YOU WANT THE TOUR,
IT'S YOURS.

21:11.601 --> 21:13.573
( all cheer )

21:13.573 --> 21:15.745
THANKS. THANK YOU, MONTY.

21:15.745 --> 21:18.508
BUT EVERYTHING
MY DAUGHTER JUST SAID

21:18.508 --> 21:20.810
MADE ME REALIZE THAT
I DON'T WANNA BE ON THE ROAD

21:20.810 --> 21:22.812
AWAY FROM THESE GUYS TOO LONG.

21:22.812 --> 21:24.684
I WOULD MISS THEM TOO MUCH.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.857
I HAVE TO DECLINE.

21:27.857 --> 21:29.689
AND I'D MISS HAVING
OUR FAMILY TOGETHER,

21:29.689 --> 21:31.391
REGARDLESS OF THE MONEY.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.523
SO MUCH MONEY.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.467
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
LET ME KNOW.

21:38.528 --> 21:39.569
IN THE MEAN TIME,

21:39.569 --> 21:43.573
COULD SOMEONE PLEASE
GET THIS CHILD OFF MY LEG?

21:43.573 --> 21:45.505
CHLOE!

21:45.505 --> 21:48.538
OH, WE'RE NOT
DOING THAT ANYMORE?

21:48.538 --> 21:50.640
SORRY, MR. CLOWNCAR.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.618
COMMUNICATION IN A FAMILY

21:58.618 --> 22:00.490
CAN TAKE A LITTLE TIME
TO PERFECT.

22:00.490 --> 22:01.551
VERY SIMILAR TO SPYING.

22:01.551 --> 22:03.553
SO MY DEBUT AS A MASTER SPY

22:03.553 --> 22:06.596
DIDN'T GO QUITE AS SMOOTHLY
AS I HAD HOPED.

22:06.596 --> 22:08.998
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE.

22:08.998 --> 22:12.832
THIS TIME, I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
LINED UP PERFECTLY.

22:14.434 --> 22:18.638
OH, GREAT.
WHEN MY FOOT GOES IN WATER,
IT MAKES ME WANNA PEE.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.340
UP AND OUT, UP AND OUT,
UP AND OUT, UP AND OUT!

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
HURRY!
