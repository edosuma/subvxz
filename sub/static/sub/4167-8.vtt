00:02.036 --> 00:04.330
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.413 --> 00:05.748
Hello.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.249
- Hi.
- My son.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.961
- Tim and I were just gonna play a game.
- I'm just not really very good at games.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.589
My mom is. I guess she's a lot smarter than you.

00:13.672 --> 00:14.840
Kesheshian says "goodbye".

00:14.924 --> 00:16.926
- Peter? He's dead?
- Yes!

00:17.009 --> 00:21.388
Agent Fundis, DEA. I'm here to talk
about Peter Scottson. I'm his partner.

00:21.472 --> 00:23.140
The one who burps?

00:23.224 --> 00:26.268
I get stares. Children cry and run away.

00:26.352 --> 00:27.603
Give a friend of mine a call.

00:27.686 --> 00:31.482
We're shooting a movie
in one of our empty houses. Needs a caterer.

00:31.565 --> 00:35.027
I'd like to solve the mystery
of the school that receives federal funding,

00:35.110 --> 00:40.532
yet promotes a religious curriculum in direct
violation of Church-State separation mandates.

00:40.616 --> 00:42.409
Sit down, Shane Botwin.

00:42.493 --> 00:43.827
I have cancer.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.412
Puppies are coming off, Nance.

00:45.496 --> 00:49.041
After reconstructive surgery,
you're gonna feel good as new.

00:49.124 --> 00:53.546
I'm separated. Dancing my way to divorce.

00:53.629 --> 00:55.130
You're gonna help me celebrate.

00:55.214 --> 00:59.009
My last two relationships,
both guys ended up dead.

01:04.181 --> 01:06.809
<i># Boxes on the hillside</i>

01:06.892 --> 01:09.895
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:09.979 --> 01:12.898
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:12.982 --> 01:15.859
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:15.943 --> 01:18.904
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:18.988 --> 01:21.824
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:21.907 --> 01:24.785
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:24.869 --> 01:27.580
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:29.331 --> 01:32.251
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:32.334 --> 01:35.170
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:35.254 --> 01:38.090
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:38.173 --> 01:41.385
<i># And they came out all the same</i>

01:41.468 --> 01:44.096
<i># And there's doctors and lawyers</i>

01:44.179 --> 01:47.057
<i># And business executives</i>

01:47.141 --> 01:49.894
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:49.977 --> 01:53.731
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:01.739 --> 02:02.990
Captain?

02:05.993 --> 02:08.412
All right, Fundis, tell me a story.

02:09.788 --> 02:13.918
Er, a man flying a kite found Scottson.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.462
We think he was stuffed in a drainpipe,

02:16.545 --> 02:18.756
till a grate busted in the rain, and...

02:19.590 --> 02:20.591
up came Pete.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.803
- Can't you take something for that?
- I've tried everything.

02:24.887 --> 02:27.056
Well, pop a fucking breath mint.

02:27.139 --> 02:28.849
What did you eat, pastrami?

02:28.933 --> 02:31.393
<i>- On rye, sir.
- What else, Fundis?</i>

02:31.477 --> 02:34.605
<i>Well, close-range shot
to the head.</i>

02:34.688 --> 02:37.566
<i>- It's ugly.
- Who, why, when?</i>

02:37.650 --> 02:40.569
<i>I've been trying to figure that out
since he went missing.</i>

02:40.653 --> 02:44.031
You know, retracing his steps, asking...

02:48.327 --> 02:51.497
- What's that?
- Summer reading from Internal Affairs.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.582
Quite the ripping yarn.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.548
"Retracing his steps"?
How about "covering your ass"?

03:00.631 --> 03:04.218
You got another story
you want to tell me, Fundis?

03:04.301 --> 03:07.638
<i>My career just took a swan dive
into a shit can.</i>

03:07.721 --> 03:11.684
I want to thank you for that.
Pete, too, since it appears he was the brains

03:11.767 --> 03:15.354
behind the skimming, extortion, wiretapping,

03:15.437 --> 03:18.107
evidence-planting operation you two had going.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.401
But good thing for us
he turned up the way he did,

03:20.484 --> 03:22.027
and we don't have to get honest.

03:22.111 --> 03:26.031
So here's the new story, Agent Asshole
Motherfucker Choke-on-my-dick.

03:26.115 --> 03:29.118
<i>You got three days
to find whatever money is left over</i>

03:29.201 --> 03:30.786
<i>from your little side business.</i>

03:30.870 --> 03:33.747
<i>And before you clean out your locker
for early retirement,</i>

03:33.831 --> 03:36.458
<i>take your uniform to the dry-cleaner's.</i>

03:36.542 --> 03:40.129
Cos we have a fucking hero
to stick in the ground.

03:43.799 --> 03:47.136
Peter Scottson served with dignity
and honour

03:47.219 --> 03:49.680
in one of our most difficult jobs.

03:50.180 --> 03:53.350
And for those of us here today,
there will be no rest

03:53.434 --> 03:56.395
until those who put him here
are brought to justice.

03:56.478 --> 03:58.397
Dear Lord,

03:58.480 --> 04:00.733
we sadly send you another son in blue.

04:00.816 --> 04:04.987
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.739
Amen.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.468
Oh, God.

04:30.262 --> 04:33.140
- Hello?
- What are you wearing?

04:33.224 --> 04:35.017
<i>You gave me the day off, boss.</i>

04:35.100 --> 04:37.269
Oh, come on. Indulge a pervert.

04:38.854 --> 04:41.857
Black dress, black shoes, black everything.

04:41.941 --> 04:45.486
- I bet you look better in red.
- Not appropriate for faking grief.

04:45.569 --> 04:47.363
Don't know what that means. Don't care.

04:47.446 --> 04:50.324
<i>- I bought you a gift.
- No, you should take it back.</i>

04:50.407 --> 04:52.576
<i>Don't you want to know what it is?</i>

04:52.660 --> 04:54.537
It's my day off.

04:56.205 --> 04:58.374
When are we gonna have sex again?

04:58.457 --> 05:01.168
When I'm feeling desperate again.

05:02.294 --> 05:04.088
<i>And when do you think that might be?</i>

05:55.931 --> 05:58.726
You get lost on your way to Forest Lawn?

06:01.812 --> 06:03.606
Never knew the man.

06:05.524 --> 06:08.527
- Is Conrad around?
- Do you see Conrad?

06:11.697 --> 06:15.075
How about one time, just for laughs,
I'll ask you a question,

06:15.159 --> 06:17.995
and you maybe answer me,
you know, like a human?

06:18.078 --> 06:21.415
What can I say?
You bring out the "fuck you" in me.

06:22.333 --> 06:26.086
Fine. Moving on.
Bringing good news. You're free.

06:26.170 --> 06:28.672
Abe Lincoln beat you to it.
What else you got?

06:28.756 --> 06:32.176
I took care of your debt.
You don't owe Marvin anything.

06:32.259 --> 06:36.096
You're gonna have trouble moving your shit
on the streets, but you still have me.

06:36.180 --> 06:40.893
I have a new territory opening up
three times the size of Agrestic, so...

06:41.518 --> 06:43.145
You're welcome.

06:44.021 --> 06:47.024
No thanks necessary, since I assume

06:48.734 --> 06:50.402
none are coming.

06:52.363 --> 06:54.782
- What's that?
- I'm making a buy.

06:54.865 --> 06:57.451
Little Miss Nancy Do-good.

06:57.535 --> 07:01.497
Burying her boyfriend
and back to dealing dime bags.

07:02.164 --> 07:04.500
All things in their proper place.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.044
Yeah, praise Jesus, blah, blah, blah.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.046
Oh, am I boring you?

07:09.129 --> 07:12.508
Well, I will stop wasting your precious time.

07:12.591 --> 07:14.009
We're a bulk business now,

07:14.093 --> 07:16.971
so you can take your little milk money
down to the corner.

07:17.054 --> 07:20.432
- Can I talk to Conrad?
- He's over with the pot clubs.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.479
Large customers with large money.

07:25.563 --> 07:29.650
Now, you come back with five figures,
and we'll do business.

07:30.943 --> 07:32.194
Hell,

07:33.362 --> 07:35.656
I'll even throw in a fountain.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.921
Oh, hey, Nance.

07:51.005 --> 07:54.091
Doug, you're cooking in my kitchen.

07:55.384 --> 07:58.429
- There's a reason for that?
- Andy's on set. I'm helping him out.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.222
Oh, that's nice.

08:01.891 --> 08:05.978
Oh, that's from the tall one.
Leif Garretty, Blue Lagoon-ish?

08:06.061 --> 08:08.105
- Silas?
- Yeah. Said you were out of weed,

08:08.188 --> 08:10.774
then he took off with a blonde.
Tiny tits, big cross?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.276
- Tara.
- And your other one,

08:12.359 --> 08:15.195
- big vocab, creepy eyes?
- Shane.

08:15.279 --> 08:17.656
He's outside with what's-her-name.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.366
- Celia's dyke.
- Isabelle.

08:21.368 --> 08:25.539
- Hey, Mrs. Botwin.
- Hello, Isabelle, Shane.

08:25.623 --> 08:28.375
- An unlikely duo.
- We've bonded through sin.

08:28.459 --> 08:29.668
And school suspension.

08:29.752 --> 08:32.462
- As in...
- Don't come back until you love Jesus.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.966
- They call it reflection.
- And we got three days of it.

08:37.176 --> 08:39.010
And how are we going to reflect?

08:39.094 --> 08:40.763
Wii tournament.

08:41.972 --> 08:43.765
Oh, my first pay check!

08:44.934 --> 08:45.935
Ha!

08:52.191 --> 08:55.069
My son's bringing in more money than I am.

08:59.073 --> 09:01.659
Any chance I could borrow $10,000?

09:02.952 --> 09:05.204
How fast can you turn it around?

09:05.287 --> 09:09.416
Seriously? Turn it around in a month.
You got 10 grand?

09:09.500 --> 09:13.003
If you could form a dummy corp.
And I form a dummy corp.

09:13.087 --> 09:17.049
You find a supplier to accept the check,
I know an accountant/councilman

09:17.132 --> 09:19.885
- with access to a civic investment portfolio...
- Can you do it?

09:19.969 --> 09:22.846
- Have before.
- Do it.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.476
Make it $50,000.

09:28.060 --> 09:31.063
"Aguatecture. " What is that, a colonic spa?

09:31.146 --> 09:35.568
- Shane, where's your karate contact sheet?
- Drawer by the coffee maker.

09:49.206 --> 09:52.251
All right, Lex, come on, baby.
Big finish. Big finish.

09:52.334 --> 09:54.628
Let's show them how they do it
in Jersey, baby.

09:54.712 --> 09:57.089
Oh, yes! Lovely, people.

09:57.172 --> 09:59.258
- Cut! Cut!
- Is there any more?

09:59.341 --> 10:02.678
Let's take a break.
Everybody, rinse out. We'll be back in 10.

10:02.761 --> 10:06.181
Wow, Paul. Great scene.
You're really an artist.

10:06.265 --> 10:09.018
Well, thanks.
We don't hear that enough in this business.

10:09.101 --> 10:12.187
And that's a tragedy.
I mean, the genre's been hijacked

10:12.271 --> 10:16.483
by amateurs, sure,
but when I see your attention to detail,

10:16.567 --> 10:20.696
the framing, the risks you take,
it makes this viewer...

10:20.779 --> 10:24.200
I guess you should know,
I've always wanted to...

10:24.283 --> 10:27.453
Be in porn? Every caterer does.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.289
Well, I think I could be great.

10:30.372 --> 10:32.666
Look, I respect your ambition,

10:32.750 --> 10:34.960
and I'd love to make it happen for you,

10:35.044 --> 10:36.712
but I work with gods.

10:36.795 --> 10:39.089
Jessica, she comes like a fountain.

10:39.173 --> 10:41.133
Lex is packing a fucking Buick.

10:41.217 --> 10:44.887
It's all about that something special
in this business.

10:46.055 --> 10:48.807
What makes you special, Andy?

10:52.353 --> 10:54.688
Footfuckers, scene one. "A" camera, mark.

10:54.772 --> 10:56.690
And action.

10:56.774 --> 10:58.067
Coming!

11:02.696 --> 11:04.281
Hello.

11:04.365 --> 11:08.911
I have a package for Mrs. Dowling.
Are you authorised to sign for it?

11:08.994 --> 11:12.831
Your feet must be aching
from all the walking around that you do.

11:12.915 --> 11:15.125
Well, it is a lot of walking.

11:15.209 --> 11:18.254
Well, why don't you come inside
and take your shoes off?

11:19.713 --> 11:23.801
That's right. Use your something special,
kid. Show me what you got.

11:24.969 --> 11:28.264
Use that big toe! That's fucking great!

11:28.347 --> 11:32.184
Footfuckers 2: Viva Las Vegas.
Scene one. "A" camera, mark.

11:32.268 --> 11:33.686
And action.

11:33.769 --> 11:35.479
Coming!

11:38.148 --> 11:40.025
Room service.

11:40.109 --> 11:41.944
I ordered that about two hours ago.

11:42.027 --> 11:46.907
I'm sorry, ma'am. The elevator got stuck.
I had to climb all 43 floors to get here.

11:46.991 --> 11:49.034
Well, your feet must be killing you.

11:49.118 --> 11:52.371
There's a huge market
for fetish videos in Eastern Europe.

11:52.454 --> 11:54.665
You're gonna be a huge star in Belarus.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.500
- I mean, huge!
- Oh, yeah!

11:56.584 --> 11:59.545
Good! Good! Get dirty, Andy! Get dirty!

12:02.840 --> 12:05.092
I finish with the backyard, Mrs. Dowling.

12:05.175 --> 12:08.762
- OK, OK, thrust, thrust!
- Oh, cramping, cramping!

12:08.846 --> 12:10.890
- Cut!
- Ow, ow, ow!

12:25.696 --> 12:28.949
Well, if it isn't the Music Man of Majestic.

12:29.033 --> 12:30.993
My partner in altruistic bullshit.

12:31.076 --> 12:34.079
How are you this afternoon,
Councilwoman?

12:34.163 --> 12:35.998
Smiling.

12:36.665 --> 12:39.877
- You got my gift?
- Not why I'm smiling.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.587
<i>But, yes, I did.</i>

12:42.838 --> 12:44.590
<i>Piece of advice.</i>

12:44.673 --> 12:49.178
Never send a woman a dress
she might not fit into.

12:50.012 --> 12:52.598
<i>- Did you try it on?
- It's a size 2.</i>

12:52.681 --> 12:56.143
Flattering and annoying at the same time.

12:56.227 --> 12:59.146
<i>I thought your breasts
would look good in red.</i>

13:00.105 --> 13:03.192
Well, it's a nice thought.

13:03.275 --> 13:05.903
Listen, I want to see you.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.156
Wear whatever dress you want,
or no dress at all.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.991
I'm almost divorced.

13:11.075 --> 13:12.451
Mazel tov.

13:12.535 --> 13:15.454
Would you like to help me celebrate?

13:17.915 --> 13:19.833
You know where I live.

13:20.668 --> 13:24.588
<i>I do. I do, indeed. See you, Councilwoman.</i>

13:30.344 --> 13:33.055
- Sure you want to do this?
- Yeah.

13:33.138 --> 13:36.684
All right, hold it up to your mouth,
and I'll light it.

13:40.062 --> 13:42.523
- How is it?
- It's...

13:42.606 --> 13:46.318
- It's kind of gross.
- Do you feel anything different?

13:46.402 --> 13:49.029
I feel like I want to brush my teeth.

13:49.113 --> 13:52.241
- Maybe it's bad shit.
- But my dad gets it from your mom.

13:56.954 --> 14:01.125
You know my mom's a drug dealer?

14:02.668 --> 14:04.753
I saw her come over once.

14:05.754 --> 14:07.631
I didn't tell anyone.

14:08.924 --> 14:10.759
I won't tell anyone.

14:11.844 --> 14:13.137
Thanks.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.435
- You gonna try it?
- Yeah.

14:20.811 --> 14:23.856
This is that moment
where I finally become cool, right?

14:23.939 --> 14:26.233
No. Just stoned.

15:04.939 --> 15:07.983
Stop it, stop it!

15:09.526 --> 15:10.819
Stop it!

15:19.620 --> 15:21.956
That's very funny, Tim. Open the door.

15:23.457 --> 15:26.210
Open the fucking door! OK.

15:26.293 --> 15:31.465

15:33.384 --> 15:36.512

15:36.595 --> 15:38.389
No, look, please.

15:38.472 --> 15:41.100
You don't talk to me.
You can't talk to me.

15:49.984 --> 15:54.530

That's my fault, too.

15:57.032 --> 16:01.662
<i># And I will build a house... #</i>

16:03.122 --> 16:05.374
Tim! Jesus!

16:05.457 --> 16:07.585
Oh, my God, are you OK?

16:07.668 --> 16:09.962
- Your kid's not OK!
- I'm so sorry.

16:10.045 --> 16:11.380
Get some help for him!

16:11.463 --> 16:15.217
- Is it OK if I have one of your cigarettes?
- It's OK if you help your kid!

16:15.301 --> 16:19.013
- I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, you say that all the time!

No, hey, hey, I have the money.

17:16.945 --> 17:19.406
I just went in to get a quarter. Hello?

17:20.366 --> 17:24.078
You know what?
Fuck you, OK? Fuck you!

17:59.446 --> 18:01.824
Thanks. That was my first boob.

18:02.783 --> 18:04.243
How was it?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.328
Good.

18:10.583 --> 18:13.210
Do you want to touch my, you know...

18:13.836 --> 18:15.880
Not really into penises.

18:22.386 --> 18:26.223
- Why haven't we ever hung out before?
- I don't know.

18:26.765 --> 18:28.726
My mom hates your mom?

18:29.935 --> 18:33.105
I think my mom's secretly in love
with your mom.

18:34.773 --> 18:38.360
I think my dad loved me
more than my mom does.

18:38.444 --> 18:40.154
My mom's a bitch.

18:41.447 --> 18:45.492
But I miss her.
I don't know why.

18:47.703 --> 18:49.538
Do you feel stoned?

18:51.207 --> 18:52.499
I guess.

18:53.417 --> 18:56.587
- I don't see what the big deal is.
- Yeah.

18:56.670 --> 18:58.297
I prefer beer.

18:59.298 --> 19:01.508
I prefer touching your boob.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.031
You want to make a buy?

19:25.908 --> 19:29.828
I said, would you like to make a buy?

19:34.291 --> 19:36.752
All right, let's... Let's just cut.

19:36.835 --> 19:38.254
Cut!

19:38.337 --> 19:40.506
You did great, kid.
You really did. Come on up.

19:40.589 --> 19:44.718
You got your foot in the door.
Or, in this case, your foot in Jessica.

19:44.802 --> 19:48.305
- Hey, go get Lex.
- Wait, wait, wait. That's it?

19:48.389 --> 19:50.266
Thanks for the foot, warm up the hot dogs?

19:50.349 --> 19:53.018
- I've been working all day.
- What do you want, a medal?

19:53.102 --> 19:57.022
It's a job.
And, yeah, go warm up the hot dogs.

19:58.315 --> 20:00.109
Well, that's bullshit.

20:00.192 --> 20:03.153
Hey, I'm talking to you, Paul St. Moritz!

20:04.780 --> 20:06.615
I always stood up for pornography.

20:06.699 --> 20:09.952
I believed in it.
I thought it provided an essential service.

20:10.035 --> 20:12.121
Light up a young person's imagination,

20:12.204 --> 20:15.249
help a sexless marriage,
keep a predator off the street!

20:15.332 --> 20:19.044
I thought porn was magical.
Now, I see it for what it really is.

20:19.128 --> 20:22.756
It's a flesh factory
and we are all slabs of meat.

20:22.840 --> 20:27.928
Lex here is not
an unbelievably enormous dick.

20:28.012 --> 20:30.055
And I'm not a foot.

20:30.139 --> 20:33.475
- You're not a foot, Andy.
- Thanks, Lex. We're human beings.

20:33.559 --> 20:35.769
I gave you my something special,
and you ate it.

20:35.853 --> 20:41.192
You took something beautiful,
like Jessica's vagina,

20:41.275 --> 20:44.069
and you made it just a place to put a foot.

20:44.904 --> 20:48.032
You need to do some soul-searching,
my friend.

20:48.115 --> 20:50.201
This whole industry does.

20:50.784 --> 20:55.164
It exploits, it dehumanises,
it degrades men.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.169
- Everybody back to one.
- Back to one!

21:01.795 --> 21:03.214
<i>This is from Nancy.</i>

21:04.340 --> 21:08.469
- First time I ever took a cheque.
- She said she wants her fountain.

21:11.472 --> 21:12.765
Conrad!

21:14.934 --> 21:17.561
- And what's your name?
- Judah.

21:17.645 --> 21:19.230
And this is...

21:20.147 --> 21:22.900
- Sunshine.
- Is that right?

21:22.983 --> 21:25.569
Well, Mr Judah, Ms Sunshine,

21:25.653 --> 21:29.240
you tell the City of Agrestic we're impressed.

21:29.323 --> 21:32.284
And you tell Nancy, if this cheque bounces,

21:33.035 --> 21:35.829
- she better start running.
- I'll do that.

21:43.671 --> 21:44.672
Stop.

21:44.755 --> 21:47.007
- I want to, but I can't.
- Stop.

21:50.928 --> 21:53.722
I have cancer. I had cancer.

21:58.811 --> 22:00.563
They cut them off.

22:01.230 --> 22:02.940
These are...

22:04.900 --> 22:06.485
spare parts.

22:09.363 --> 22:10.948
I don't care.

22:32.094 --> 22:35.764
- No, I need to leave my top on.
- Celia Hodes,

22:36.640 --> 22:41.437
you're a smart, ambitious, sexy woman.

22:41.770 --> 22:43.439
I'm embarrassed.

22:44.899 --> 22:48.360
I haven't gotten hard on my own for two years.

22:49.486 --> 22:52.907
- I've been popping magical boner pills.
- Magical boner pills?

22:52.990 --> 22:54.074
Yeah.

22:54.158 --> 22:57.161
I took one in your driveway half an hour ago.

22:57.661 --> 22:59.872
Do you like my penis any less?

23:04.001 --> 23:07.254
No. No, I don't.

23:08.589 --> 23:10.007
We're used.

23:11.383 --> 23:13.802
It doesn't mean we can't be sexy.

23:13.886 --> 23:17.431
Doesn't mean we can't,
pardon my language,

23:18.265 --> 23:19.642
fuck like bunnies.

23:35.783 --> 23:36.909
Cool.

23:50.881 --> 23:55.594
If I still had feeling in my nipple,
I bet that would be amazing.

23:55.678 --> 23:58.389
All right, enough. Listen to me.

23:59.223 --> 24:01.141
<i>I barely know you,</i>

24:01.225 --> 24:03.018
<i>but the first time I saw you,</i>

24:03.102 --> 24:07.064
<i>there was something about you
that was so familiar.</i>

24:07.147 --> 24:09.233
<i>Familiar in the best way.</i>

24:10.860 --> 24:14.864
<i>Like we shared something, like...</i>

24:14.947 --> 24:16.532
<i>we had a secret.</i>

24:17.616 --> 24:20.578
<i>I just want to know you. I don't know why.</i>

24:21.412 --> 24:22.830
<i>I just do.</i>

24:23.497 --> 24:25.332
<i>OK. Stop talking.</i>

24:38.888 --> 24:41.223
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:41.682 --> 24:43.434
Mrs. Botwin.

24:43.767 --> 24:46.020
- That's me.
- I'm Valerie.

24:46.103 --> 24:48.314
You want to take a step up
to the x-ray machine?

24:48.397 --> 24:49.607
OK.

24:53.736 --> 24:54.778
You're the doctor?

24:54.862 --> 24:58.115
Oh, no, doctor's at lunch.
I just take the x-rays.

24:59.074 --> 25:01.785
- You can take out your breast.
- What?

25:03.495 --> 25:05.122
Oh, right, right.

25:05.206 --> 25:07.541
Mammogram's nothing to be nervous about.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.836
- It'll be over in a minute.
- Right. Sorry.

25:11.545 --> 25:12.713
I'm sorry.

25:12.796 --> 25:15.841
Why are you apologising?
You've got great breasts.

25:15.925 --> 25:18.427
- These?
- You should see some of the jugs we get.

25:18.510 --> 25:19.595
Gravity's cruel.

25:19.678 --> 25:21.889
All right, lift up your breast

25:21.972 --> 25:24.350
and get as much of it
onto the plate as you can.

25:24.433 --> 25:25.768
- Erm...
- All right?

25:25.851 --> 25:28.103
Just get it all on there.
Just spread it out.

25:28.187 --> 25:30.856
- No. No.
- Just right on there.

25:30.940 --> 25:34.401
Yeah, no, that's great. That's great.
OK, now you're gonna feel...

25:34.485 --> 25:38.239
- Really?
... a little bit of pressure when I lower the top.

25:38.322 --> 25:40.741
- And... smush.
- Aah...

25:40.824 --> 25:44.286
OK, I know it's probably uncomfortable,
but I'm fast.

25:52.086 --> 25:54.129
Do you like this job?

25:57.049 --> 26:00.761
- Are you locked in?
- Oh, yeah. Ready to go.

26:01.845 --> 26:03.430
I know who you are.

26:06.517 --> 26:07.851
Excuse me?

26:07.935 --> 26:09.937
I...

26:10.020 --> 26:11.939
know...

26:12.022 --> 26:14.191
who...

26:14.275 --> 26:15.442
you...

26:15.526 --> 26:16.819
are.

26:23.409 --> 26:27.413
So, Nancy Botwin, why are you here?

26:28.414 --> 26:30.332
And what do you want?

26:30.416 --> 26:33.419
And why the fuck are you stalking me?

26:42.887 --> 26:46.682
