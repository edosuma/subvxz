01:06.478 --> 01:07.645
Ho, ho!

01:29.701 --> 01:33.236
Shh! Fritz.
Now, be very still.

01:33.238 --> 01:35.304
This is how we'll do it.

01:35.306 --> 01:37.408
With science,
mechanics...

01:38.810 --> 01:40.512
and a bit of luck.

01:43.147 --> 01:46.482
First, we've got energy.

01:46.484 --> 01:49.722
The heat from the candle
will make the balloon rise.

02:01.734 --> 02:03.600
With the momentum
from the ball...

02:03.602 --> 02:06.435
that hits the monkey...

02:06.437 --> 02:08.639
...and pivots
onto the bellows.

02:11.242 --> 02:13.279
Which blows the longboat.

02:15.614 --> 02:18.749
Giving us Newton's
third law of physics...

02:18.751 --> 02:22.586
that says every action
has an equal...

02:22.588 --> 02:24.390
- and opposite...?
- Reaction.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.093
- Yes!
- Yes!

02:30.696 --> 02:33.564
Do they bite?

02:33.566 --> 02:35.599
I suppose they do.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.602
If you're horrid to them.

02:39.271 --> 02:41.204
Oh, there you are.

02:41.206 --> 02:43.841
Up and down I've been
looking for you rascals.

02:43.843 --> 02:45.175
Worn out, I am.

02:45.177 --> 02:46.476
We were
catching a mouse.

02:46.478 --> 02:49.146
Well, if you catch one,
I'm not cooking it.

02:49.148 --> 02:50.647
Too many bones.

02:50.649 --> 02:52.215
Now, come on, be quick.

02:52.217 --> 02:54.286
We have a lot to do
before this evening.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.186
There you are!

02:56.188 --> 02:57.354
I've been looking
all over for you.

02:57.356 --> 02:58.755
Look at the state of you.

02:58.757 --> 03:00.325
We were trying
to catch a mouse...

03:00.327 --> 03:03.161
with toys and momentum
and matches and...

03:03.163 --> 03:04.295
Matches?

03:04.297 --> 03:05.897
It was Clara's idea.

03:05.899 --> 03:08.265
Catching mice
on Christmas Eve?

03:08.267 --> 03:09.634
Honestly, Clara.

03:09.636 --> 03:11.569
We nearly had him.

03:11.571 --> 03:13.771
What were you gonna do with
him when you caught him?

03:13.773 --> 03:17.207
Teach him tricks.
He could dance.

03:17.209 --> 03:20.279
Ah. There you are.
What do we think?

03:20.880 --> 03:22.847
It's wonderful, Father.

03:22.849 --> 03:24.549
With a few adjustments,
perhaps.

03:24.551 --> 03:25.820
It's not how Mother did it.

03:26.787 --> 03:27.788
Fritz.

03:33.893 --> 03:37.362
Um... Now, children,
I have some presents for you.

03:37.364 --> 03:38.798
But it's not Christmas Day.

03:39.833 --> 03:40.867
They're from your mother.

03:42.736 --> 03:46.339
She asked me to give them
to you on Christmas Eve.

03:47.807 --> 03:49.541
That one's for you.

03:50.945 --> 03:52.847
- Louise.
- Thank you.

03:53.881 --> 03:55.750
Soldiers! Yay!

03:57.450 --> 03:59.283
Clara.

03:59.285 --> 04:01.452
The enemy
has found our location!

04:04.257 --> 04:06.357
We've been ambushed!

04:06.359 --> 04:07.928
They're from both sides!

04:09.229 --> 04:11.364
It's Mother's favorite.

04:11.831 --> 04:13.601
Yes. Yes, it was.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.244
What is it, Clara?

04:29.282 --> 04:31.550
It's an egg of some sort.

04:31.552 --> 04:33.585
What's inside?
Is it jewelry?

04:33.587 --> 04:34.822
I don't know.

04:37.591 --> 04:38.958
It's locked.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.528
Are you sure it opens?

04:41.595 --> 04:43.765
There's a keyhole. Here.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.498
But there's no key.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.969
Why would Mother give me this
without a key?

04:49.971 --> 04:52.673
It's just a silly egg
that doesn't open.

04:55.910 --> 04:57.445
It's not just
a silly egg, Fritz.

04:57.812 --> 04:58.946
Clara.

05:00.916 --> 05:02.284
Clara!

05:16.965 --> 05:20.299
"Everything you need
is inside."

05:20.301 --> 05:21.302
Clara.

05:26.541 --> 05:28.276
Is everything all right?

05:29.611 --> 05:30.645
No.

05:31.947 --> 05:34.316
This is a pin tumbler lock.

05:35.984 --> 05:38.551
It's impossible to open
without a key.

05:38.553 --> 05:39.688
I see.

05:41.356 --> 05:43.356
Well, why don't you
get ready for the party,

05:43.358 --> 05:44.993
and then you can
work it out tomorrow.

05:49.665 --> 05:51.932
Clara, Christmas comes...

05:51.934 --> 05:54.467
whether we like it or not.

05:54.469 --> 05:56.371
We must do our best
to enjoy it.

05:57.472 --> 05:59.441
I don't want to enjoy it.

06:02.011 --> 06:04.044
I don't want to enjoy anything
right now.

06:04.046 --> 06:05.812
Well, that may be
the case...

06:05.814 --> 06:08.650
but it's important to maintain
traditions as a family.

06:09.584 --> 06:11.353
It's what's expected of us.

06:13.090 --> 06:14.922
I don't care
what's expected.

06:14.924 --> 06:16.692
- Well, you should.
- Father?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.330
It's almost time to go.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.501
Do I look all right?

06:28.704 --> 06:29.839
Yes.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.808
Yes, indeed.

06:35.410 --> 06:37.413
Please get your sister ready.

06:39.549 --> 06:42.418
You must be gentle
with him, Clara.

06:43.753 --> 06:45.555
I wish Mother was here.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.590
We all do.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.730
I have to open this.

06:56.732 --> 06:57.832
You'll work it out.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.669
You're an extremely
clever girl, just like Mother.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.171
I don't feel
very clever lately.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.439
Maybe you should spend

07:04.441 --> 07:05.372
a little less time
in the attic...

07:05.374 --> 07:08.877
and a little more time
in the real world.

07:08.879 --> 07:11.915
The real world just doesn't
make sense to me anymore.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.816
You must try, Clara.

07:14.818 --> 07:16.452
If only for Father.

07:18.121 --> 07:22.658
Father is acting
as if nothing has changed.

07:25.429 --> 07:27.629
But everything has changed.

07:27.631 --> 07:30.031
"D." It's Drosselmeyer.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.935
He must have made this.

07:32.936 --> 07:35.203
And maybe he can open it!

07:35.205 --> 07:37.472
Good.

07:37.474 --> 07:39.507
Now, will you let me
finish with your hair?

07:39.509 --> 07:41.676
Yes. But please hurry.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.502
It is important to be

08:07.504 --> 08:09.238
on your best behavior tonight.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.742
That means remembering our
manners at dinner. Fritz!

08:14.078 --> 08:16.848
I do want one dance
with you, Louise.

08:17.916 --> 08:19.651
And you, Clara.

08:21.519 --> 08:23.653
- Do I have to dance?
- Yes, you do.

08:23.655 --> 08:25.821
And no disappearing
tonight either.

08:25.823 --> 08:28.624
Mingle and engage
with the guests.

08:28.626 --> 08:29.761
What about me?

08:30.795 --> 08:32.061
What about you?

08:32.063 --> 08:33.765
Who will dance with me?

08:54.752 --> 08:56.552
Yay! Godfather's house.

08:56.554 --> 08:58.254
Last one in
is a nincompoop.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.827
Master Drosselmeyer
welcomes

09:03.829 --> 09:06.098
Mr. and Mrs. Jeremiah Jones.

09:08.167 --> 09:12.668
Doctor and Mrs. McDonald,
Timothy and Ezekiel McDonald.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.171
Magic!

09:14.173 --> 09:15.604
Fritz, come on.

09:15.606 --> 09:18.177
How do we
get them back?

09:22.214 --> 09:23.746
The Stahlbaum family.

09:23.748 --> 09:26.219
Benjamin, Louise,
Fritz, and Clara.

10:03.356 --> 10:04.656
Godfather?

10:20.673 --> 10:21.739
Hello.

10:24.077 --> 10:26.212
Have you seen
Godfather anywhere?

10:27.814 --> 10:29.147
He sees everything.

10:29.149 --> 10:31.282
Which can be a great help
to an old man.

10:31.284 --> 10:33.119
Godfather.

10:33.887 --> 10:35.121
Hello, Clara.

10:35.788 --> 10:37.022
I need your help.

10:37.024 --> 10:39.791
Ah. But I need
your help first.

10:39.793 --> 10:41.360
Look at this damn thing.

10:44.265 --> 10:46.233
Backwards.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.367
It moves...

10:48.369 --> 10:49.936
backwards.

10:51.004 --> 10:53.271
The mechanism
must be reversed.

10:53.273 --> 10:55.006
I know, but I can't,
for the life of me,

10:55.008 --> 10:56.743
figure out why.

10:58.878 --> 10:59.880
May I?

11:00.247 --> 11:02.247
Please.

11:07.088 --> 11:09.088
It looks like the idler wheel
has slipped.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.189
Hmm.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.256
Causing the pinion ring

11:11.258 --> 11:12.826
to engage
the secondary drive gear.

11:13.260 --> 11:14.725
Pliers.

11:14.727 --> 11:15.728
Ah.

11:35.683 --> 11:36.784
There.

11:40.454 --> 11:41.720
Ah.

11:41.722 --> 11:44.291
Clever girl.

11:45.692 --> 11:47.861
I knew you could do it.

11:47.863 --> 11:49.929
All right now, Miss Clara...

11:49.931 --> 11:53.335
Why are you down here with me
instead of upstairs, dancing?

11:54.935 --> 11:57.103
I need your help
with something.

11:57.105 --> 11:58.240
With this.

12:00.342 --> 12:01.409
Ah.

12:04.379 --> 12:08.149
I haven't seen this
in a very long time.

12:11.820 --> 12:15.255
I made it
for another clever girl...

12:15.257 --> 12:16.823
who came to live with me

12:16.825 --> 12:18.693
after she was orphaned
at a very early age.

12:20.295 --> 12:22.228
- Mother.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:22.230 --> 12:24.898
You know,
when she first arrived...

12:24.900 --> 12:27.867
she wouldn't leave her room.

12:27.869 --> 12:30.303
Spent day and night
locked away...

12:30.305 --> 12:33.141
her head buried
in her books.

12:34.309 --> 12:37.744
So, what did you do?

12:37.746 --> 12:40.347
I left this
outside her door.

12:40.349 --> 12:42.884
And, over time,
she came to trust me...

12:43.486 --> 12:45.486
but most importantly...

12:45.488 --> 12:46.888
herself.

12:49.357 --> 12:52.058
And now
she's given it to you.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.362
But she didn't
leave me the key.

12:55.530 --> 12:57.732
You must miss her terribly.

12:58.099 --> 13:00.434
I know I do.

13:00.436 --> 13:04.338
And I can't imagine
how your father must feel.

13:04.340 --> 13:07.007
All Father cares about
is appearances.

13:07.009 --> 13:08.375
No.

13:08.377 --> 13:11.180
My guess is he feels
every bit the way you do.

13:12.048 --> 13:13.480
Remember, Clara,

13:13.482 --> 13:15.917
some locks are harder
to pick than others.

13:17.253 --> 13:19.821
And I'm afraid this one
is especially tricky.

13:21.490 --> 13:23.156
Pin tumblers.

13:23.158 --> 13:24.858
I know.

13:24.860 --> 13:26.295
I tried.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.230
Oh.

13:29.232 --> 13:30.498
It's time.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.170
Here, you run along
and I'll be up shortly.

13:34.837 --> 13:36.237
It's Christmas Eve.

13:36.239 --> 13:39.075
It's going to be
a magical night.

13:48.952 --> 13:51.188
Yes, I know, my friend.

13:52.022 --> 13:53.887
It won't be easy.

13:53.889 --> 13:55.992
But it was her
mother's dying wish...

13:57.194 --> 13:59.263
so go keep an eye on her.

14:14.845 --> 14:16.578
Ladies and gentlemen...

14:16.580 --> 14:19.547
my favorite part
of Christmas...

14:19.549 --> 14:22.484
my favorite part
of this evening...

14:22.486 --> 14:24.886
I present to you...

14:24.888 --> 14:26.021
your gifts.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.210
"Fritz."

14:51.448 --> 14:52.816
Clara.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.984
Where have you been?

14:55.986 --> 14:57.452
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

14:57.454 --> 14:59.387
I was in Drosselmeyer's
workshop trying to open...

14:59.389 --> 15:01.023
I told you
not to disappear.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.960
And I was expecting
to dance with you.

15:04.095 --> 15:06.495
Father, I really don't
want to dance.

15:06.497 --> 15:10.335
Why, Clara, must you think
only about yourself?

15:11.669 --> 15:14.505
I could ask the same of you.

15:24.982 --> 15:26.483
Come look!
Come over here!

15:26.485 --> 15:28.017
- Come look!
- I need to go.

15:28.019 --> 15:29.952
- No, this way.
- Okay.

15:31.657 --> 15:33.324
I found mine.

15:58.517 --> 16:00.249
Look at my present.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.286
A nutcracker soldier?

16:04.288 --> 16:05.456
What do you think of him?

16:06.457 --> 16:07.990
How handsome.

16:07.992 --> 16:09.392
He's your boyfriend.

17:10.623 --> 17:11.990
What?

17:13.358 --> 17:14.527
Where?

18:36.110 --> 18:37.579
Clever, Godfather.

18:38.345 --> 18:39.346
Clever.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.295
That's mine!

18:58.265 --> 18:59.300
My key!

19:35.870 --> 19:37.739
Bring back my key!

19:48.517 --> 19:50.318
Filthy mouse.

20:15.378 --> 20:17.680
A nutcracker soldier.

20:27.590 --> 20:28.722
Halt!

20:28.724 --> 20:29.957
Who goes there?

20:29.959 --> 20:32.493
- It's just me!
- State your purpose, Just Me.

20:32.495 --> 20:35.563
No, my name is Clara,
and I must cross this bridge.

20:35.565 --> 20:36.564
Impossible.

20:36.566 --> 20:37.431
Nobody crosses the bridge
to the Fourth Realm...

20:37.433 --> 20:39.834
without a direct order
from the regents.

20:39.836 --> 20:41.570
Fourth Realm?

20:42.638 --> 20:44.238
Where am I?

20:44.240 --> 20:46.240
You're in
the Christmas Tree Forest.

20:46.242 --> 20:47.976
But that is
the Fourth Realm...

20:47.978 --> 20:50.244
which is currently at war
with the other three realms.

20:50.246 --> 20:51.445
War?

20:51.447 --> 20:52.846
That is correct,
Miss Clara Just Me.

20:52.848 --> 20:56.283
No. My name isn't
Clara Just Me.

20:56.285 --> 20:57.918
It's Stahlbaum.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.821
Clara Stahlbaum.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.790
Stahlbaum?

21:01.792 --> 21:03.694
Are you a relation
to Marie Stahlbaum?

21:04.361 --> 21:05.493
She's my mother.

21:05.495 --> 21:06.795
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

21:06.797 --> 21:09.198
I didn't recognize you,
Princess Clara.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.932
Princess?

21:10.934 --> 21:12.299
Captain Phillip Hoffman.

21:12.301 --> 21:14.401
At your service,
Your Majesty.

21:14.403 --> 21:15.570
Maybe I have been

21:15.572 --> 21:16.840
spending too much time
in the attic.

21:19.910 --> 21:22.877
Captain Hoffman,
I'd like to cross the river.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.479
But the Fourth Realm
is a very...

21:24.481 --> 21:27.582
I have to go,
Captain Hoffman.

21:27.584 --> 21:29.352
Is that an order,
Princess Clara?

21:30.454 --> 21:33.423
Yes. I suppose it is.

21:35.425 --> 21:37.692
And you can call me Clara.

21:37.694 --> 21:38.829
Is that an order, too?

21:40.831 --> 21:42.330
Yes.

21:42.332 --> 21:44.367
Very well.
Call me Captain.

22:07.524 --> 22:08.656
Jingles!

22:08.658 --> 22:10.792
Wake up, you lazy horse.

22:10.794 --> 22:12.830
Jingles!

22:22.373 --> 22:24.807
Guess I'm not
in London anymore.

22:24.809 --> 22:27.710
London?
What's London?

22:27.712 --> 22:29.377
It's where I'm from.

22:29.379 --> 22:32.114
Clara?
What are we looking for?

22:32.116 --> 22:34.415
A gold key.

22:34.417 --> 22:36.619
It must be important,
this key.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.556
It is. Very.

22:40.691 --> 22:42.725
Are you scared, Captain?

22:42.727 --> 22:44.961
Me? Never.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.032
Are you out here
all by yourself, Captain?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.466
Of course.

22:50.468 --> 22:52.701
I'm the only nutcracker
in the entire kingdom.

22:52.703 --> 22:54.804
- Don't you get lonely?
- Lonely?

22:54.806 --> 22:57.006
No. I know my place.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.974
That's good enough for me.

22:58.976 --> 23:00.811
You're lucky.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.412
I wish I knew mine.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.682
But you're
the daughter of the queen.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.918
Surely you know your place.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.420
I'm afraid not.

23:10.789 --> 23:12.589
That's why I have
to find that key.

23:12.591 --> 23:14.791
Then we shall
do exactly that.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.492
Stop!

23:16.494 --> 23:17.794
There he is!

23:17.796 --> 23:19.430
Mouserinks!

23:20.498 --> 23:23.700
Ah! That diabolical
little rodent.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.902
We need to approach
with extreme caution!

23:27.873 --> 23:29.008
Coward!

23:30.676 --> 23:31.710
Clara, wait!

23:40.519 --> 23:43.620
Give me my key back...

23:43.622 --> 23:46.923
you horrid little mouse!

23:46.925 --> 23:49.961
That key belongs to me!

23:49.963 --> 23:51.662
Come on out of there!

23:51.664 --> 23:53.197
Come on!

23:55.567 --> 23:56.936
Clara!

24:04.676 --> 24:06.143
Let me go!

24:06.145 --> 24:07.579
Put me down!

24:09.681 --> 24:11.818
Put me down!

24:12.719 --> 24:14.018
Captain!

24:14.020 --> 24:16.120
Captain, help me!

24:16.122 --> 24:17.123
Captain!

24:25.131 --> 24:26.530
Run!

24:26.532 --> 24:28.465
- What is that thing?
- It's the Mouse King.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.769
Don't look back.
Just keep running.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.654
I think we've lost him.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.791
Show yourself!

24:52.859 --> 24:54.558
Oh. Jingles.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.060
Jingles, good boy.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.561
Clara, we need to go.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.197
- Not without my key.
- But...

24:59.199 --> 25:03.035
<i>Who's intruding in my realm?</i>

25:03.037 --> 25:04.838
Okay. Maybe going
is a good idea.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.242
<i>Is that you, Clara Stahlbaum?</i>

25:10.244 --> 25:11.712
<i>Why are you here?</i>

25:13.847 --> 25:16.214
<i>I have your key.</i>

25:16.216 --> 25:18.283
It's a trap.
If you go...

25:18.285 --> 25:19.918
you'll never come back.
No one ever does.

25:19.920 --> 25:20.921
<i>Clara!</i>

25:21.754 --> 25:24.458
<i>Come here and get your key!</i>

25:25.793 --> 25:26.860
<i>Clara!</i>

25:27.695 --> 25:29.695
What was that?

25:29.697 --> 25:31.697
That was Mother Ginger.

25:31.699 --> 25:33.934
And she doesn't like
intruders.

25:49.050 --> 25:50.116
Halt.

25:50.118 --> 25:51.284
I need to
get to the palace.

25:51.286 --> 25:53.286
I'm sure you do,
sunshine.

25:53.288 --> 25:55.054
But we have
procedures around here.

25:55.056 --> 25:56.189
Protocols.

25:56.191 --> 25:57.556
I'm Captain Phillip Hoffman

25:57.558 --> 25:58.757
and I demand
you let us through.

25:58.759 --> 26:01.094
- Oh! "Demand," is it now?
- "Demand," oh.

26:01.096 --> 26:03.096
Captain Hoffman of the famous
Hoffmans, is it?

26:03.098 --> 26:04.663
Well, if we'd known
you were coming,

26:04.665 --> 26:06.132
we would have
rolled out the red carpet...

26:06.134 --> 26:09.935
booked the trumpeteers.
Captain Hoffman has arrived.

26:09.937 --> 26:12.672
For goodness' sake,
she's a princess.

26:12.674 --> 26:14.140
Well, they
all say that these days.

26:14.142 --> 26:15.808
Wishing don't make it so,
my love.

26:15.810 --> 26:18.711
Overindulgent fathers,
that's what I put it down to.

26:18.713 --> 26:20.013
Would it help if I told you

26:20.015 --> 26:21.681
that her name
was Clara Stahlbaum?

26:21.683 --> 26:23.950
Daughter of
Marie Stahlbaum?

26:25.653 --> 26:27.220
All right, just a few
questions, Your Highness,

26:27.222 --> 26:28.587
and you'll be on your way.

26:28.589 --> 26:29.724
This is ridiculous.

26:31.226 --> 26:32.859
Have you had any contact
with mice

26:32.861 --> 26:34.293
or mouse-like
entities recently?

26:34.295 --> 26:36.263
- I was in the Fourth Realm.
- Thank you.

26:36.265 --> 26:37.897
Do you have any cheese
or cheese-based products

26:37.899 --> 26:39.099
on or about your person?

26:39.101 --> 26:40.666
- I...
- Thank you.

26:40.668 --> 26:42.136
How would you describe
your sympathies

26:42.138 --> 26:44.937
towards rodents in general?

26:44.939 --> 26:46.739
- Well...
- Thank you. Good, right.

26:46.741 --> 26:48.174
Well, that is
the survey complete.

26:48.176 --> 26:50.377
There's no ink
coming out your pen.

26:50.379 --> 26:52.645
You may pass, please.

26:52.647 --> 26:55.281
Attention!
Lower the bridge!

26:55.283 --> 26:56.349
Thank you.

26:56.351 --> 26:57.552
Lower the drawbridge!

27:11.867 --> 27:14.168
Is that
Marie's daughter?

27:14.170 --> 27:15.804
She's so beautiful.

27:19.641 --> 27:22.008
Make way
for the princess.

27:38.094 --> 27:39.628
Mother.

27:48.737 --> 27:49.871
Your Excellencies...

27:49.873 --> 27:53.043
may I present
Miss Clara Stahlbaum.

27:56.246 --> 27:58.379
Is it true? It is true.

27:58.381 --> 27:59.780
I'm Hawthorne...

27:59.782 --> 28:01.915
Regent of
the Land of Flowers...

28:01.917 --> 28:03.220
at your most humble service.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.819
I am Shiver...

28:05.821 --> 28:07.855
Regent of the Land
of Snowflakes, ma'am.

28:07.857 --> 28:09.056
An honor.

28:09.058 --> 28:11.226
And the Regent
of the Land of Sweets...

28:11.228 --> 28:13.161
Sugar Plum.

28:13.163 --> 28:15.163
I never thought
this day would come.

28:15.165 --> 28:17.365
Oh, tell us, we long for news.

28:17.367 --> 28:19.369
How is our queen, dear Marie?

28:20.837 --> 28:23.273
- My mother?
- We miss her so.

28:25.876 --> 28:26.943
You don't know?

28:27.844 --> 28:29.712
My mother, she's...

28:32.149 --> 28:33.214
She died.

28:35.419 --> 28:37.787
Marie, dead?

28:39.756 --> 28:41.958
We are so sorry
for your loss.

28:42.792 --> 28:45.994
To leave life so young...

28:45.996 --> 28:48.999
She was the most beautiful,
wonderful...

28:50.368 --> 28:52.867
She meant everything to us.

28:52.869 --> 28:54.070
Everything.

29:01.746 --> 29:03.145
This is
your mother's throne...

29:03.147 --> 29:05.347
Your Grace.

29:05.349 --> 29:08.152
Have you come
to save us, Clara?

29:09.786 --> 29:11.120
No.

29:12.290 --> 29:13.355
I'm sorry.

29:13.357 --> 29:16.791
I didn't even know this place
existed before today.

29:16.793 --> 29:18.826
You see, I was looking for
a Christmas present

29:18.828 --> 29:19.863
from my godfather.

29:20.298 --> 29:22.200
I love Christmas!

29:22.900 --> 29:24.168
What's Christmas?

29:25.537 --> 29:28.304
And then I ran into this
horrible little mouse.

29:28.306 --> 29:29.805
Mouse?

29:29.807 --> 29:31.807
And that's when
I met the captain.

29:31.809 --> 29:33.309
We barely escaped
Mother Ginger

29:33.311 --> 29:34.511
and the Mouse King.

29:34.513 --> 29:36.946
You met Mother Ginger?

29:36.948 --> 29:38.547
Oh, my dear Clara...

29:38.549 --> 29:40.950
you're lucky to be alive.

29:40.952 --> 29:42.952
You must promise
never to go back

29:42.954 --> 29:44.286
to the Land of Amusements,
Clara!

29:44.288 --> 29:45.554
Oh! Hawthorne!

29:45.556 --> 29:48.158
Its title has been
rescinded, Hawthorne!

29:48.160 --> 29:51.328
Oh! Of course.
I meant the Fourth Realm.

29:51.330 --> 29:52.828
Apologies.

29:52.830 --> 29:55.298
I'm just so upset.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.167
Forget I ever mentioned
the Land of...

29:57.169 --> 29:58.303
Oh!

30:01.373 --> 30:03.573
Oh.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.941
It's pure fortune
you got out alive.

30:05.943 --> 30:08.110
No one ever escapes
from the Fourth Realm.

30:08.112 --> 30:09.479
Hawthorne is right.

30:09.481 --> 30:11.381
We can't risk
losing our princess

30:11.383 --> 30:12.583
when she's only
just arrived.

30:12.585 --> 30:14.918
- But...
- And talking of arriving...

30:14.920 --> 30:17.954
we need to organize a pageant
to celebrate your coming.

30:17.956 --> 30:20.257
- Oh!
- And a tour of the realms.

30:20.259 --> 30:22.492
Oh, this is so exciting!

30:22.494 --> 30:25.163
I love a pageant!

30:29.468 --> 30:32.435
That sounds lovely...

30:32.437 --> 30:35.306
but I have to get back
to Drosselmeyer's party.

30:41.980 --> 30:43.115
She doesn't know.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.985
Time is very different
in the realms.

30:47.352 --> 30:48.985
Very.

30:48.987 --> 30:50.387
Come.

30:50.389 --> 30:52.856
I'll show you.

30:52.858 --> 30:55.191
Princess Clara, I'll be
returning to my post now.

30:55.193 --> 30:57.129
You are not leaving me.

30:57.529 --> 30:59.032
That's an order.

31:02.602 --> 31:04.168
Sugar Plum...

31:04.170 --> 31:05.903
who's Mother Ginger?

31:05.905 --> 31:07.638
Well, she used to be a regent.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.107
Just like me
and Hawthorne and Shiver.

31:10.109 --> 31:12.443
She was the Regent
of the Land of...

31:12.445 --> 31:13.513
Amusements.

31:15.113 --> 31:16.114
But now...

31:16.616 --> 31:18.850
she is banished.

31:19.985 --> 31:21.918
Why was she...

31:21.920 --> 31:23.921
banished?

31:23.923 --> 31:26.357
We had no choice, Clara.

31:26.359 --> 31:29.026
She tried to take control
of the other realms...

31:29.028 --> 31:30.361
by force.

31:30.363 --> 31:33.297
But when her evil
intentions became clear...

31:33.299 --> 31:35.966
even her own people
deserted her.

31:35.968 --> 31:37.335
And her realm...

31:37.337 --> 31:39.205
fell to ruin.

31:40.139 --> 31:41.539
That's so tragic.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.177
But things are
looking up

31:46.179 --> 31:48.946
now that you're here,
dear Clara.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.317
Come! It's time
to put your mind at ease.

31:55.154 --> 31:58.323
See anything familiar?

31:58.325 --> 32:01.326
It looks like the clock
in Godfather's ballroom.

32:01.328 --> 32:02.927
But that's impossible.

32:02.929 --> 32:04.230
Is it?

32:09.168 --> 32:11.238
Stand very still.

32:29.690 --> 32:31.125
I'm back.

32:32.359 --> 32:34.928
Everything seems to be
going so slowly.

32:36.130 --> 32:38.263
How is this possible?

32:38.265 --> 32:41.403
Your world moves much more
slowly than our world.

32:44.371 --> 32:45.473
Fritz and Louise.

32:46.140 --> 32:47.508
There they are.

32:51.145 --> 32:52.513
And look, there's Father.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.352
He looks...

32:59.421 --> 33:00.653
lost.

33:00.655 --> 33:03.958
Everything looks different
from the realms.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.201
<i>Voila.</i>

33:21.776 --> 33:23.342
For the pageant.

33:23.344 --> 33:26.446
Which one
will you choose?

33:26.448 --> 33:31.417
I'm not very good at dresses
and hair, shoes...

33:31.419 --> 33:35.188
If I may be so bold
as to suggest that I help?

33:35.190 --> 33:37.423
- Would you?
- It's my favorite thing!

33:37.425 --> 33:40.393
Oh, we will not
disappoint them.

33:40.395 --> 33:43.264
You will look magnificent.

33:48.671 --> 33:50.771
Did my mother
ever talk about me?

33:50.773 --> 33:54.140
Oh, yes. All the time.

33:54.142 --> 33:58.079
Sometimes it seemed as if
you were right here with us.

33:59.247 --> 34:01.216
Now, close your eyes.

34:02.450 --> 34:04.285
Close your eyes.

34:10.190 --> 34:13.062
Now, open your eyes.

34:14.463 --> 34:15.661
Do you like it?

34:15.664 --> 34:17.199
I love it.

34:19.568 --> 34:21.467
I look so different.

34:21.469 --> 34:24.739
You look like
the daughter of a queen.

34:29.712 --> 34:32.813
Ladies and gentlemen,
on this momentous day...

34:32.815 --> 34:34.815
in the history
of the Four Realms...

34:34.818 --> 34:39.319
We are proud and privileged
to present before you...

34:39.321 --> 34:43.290
Clara Stahlbaum,
daughter of Queen Marie.

35:01.211 --> 35:03.244
They're all staring at me,
Sugar Plum.

35:03.246 --> 35:04.779
Of course.

35:04.781 --> 35:08.117
You're every inch
your mother's daughter.

36:10.548 --> 36:13.716
The ballet tells the story
of the Four Realms...

36:13.718 --> 36:16.220
how your mother
discovered our world.

36:43.882 --> 36:46.350
First, the Land of Flowers.

37:33.532 --> 37:34.664
Now...

37:34.666 --> 37:35.967
the Land of Snowflakes.

37:56.723 --> 37:58.590
And the Land of Sweets.

39:04.491 --> 39:05.759
Mice?

39:07.060 --> 39:09.861
Now we're in
the Fourth Realm.

39:09.863 --> 39:12.631
Watch closely, Clara.

39:12.633 --> 39:14.933
This is where
our troubles began.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.737
With Mother Ginger
and the mice?

39:21.541 --> 39:23.042
Beastly woman.

39:23.044 --> 39:25.046
There's nothing motherly
about her.

40:24.005 --> 40:28.040
Mother Ginger's the one
who began this war.

40:28.042 --> 40:30.510
I hope you'll be the one
to finish it.

40:31.445 --> 40:32.680
What do you mean?

40:49.664 --> 40:51.933
Come, I'll show you.

40:55.237 --> 40:58.138
Dear Queen Marie kept
Mother Ginger in line...

40:58.140 --> 41:01.975
but now that she's gone,
we're utterly defenseless.

41:01.977 --> 41:03.810
I don't understand.

41:03.812 --> 41:06.914
You see, once we were
lifeless toys...

41:06.916 --> 41:09.116
mere playthings for children.

41:09.118 --> 41:11.919
Then your mother arrived
and changed everything.

41:11.921 --> 41:14.689
She gave us life.

41:15.958 --> 41:17.092
How?

41:18.726 --> 41:19.794
With this.

41:20.930 --> 41:22.865
The Engine.

41:24.267 --> 41:25.866
This is
my mother's invention?

41:25.868 --> 41:29.569
Yes.
The Engine made us real.

41:29.571 --> 41:32.072
And now we have feelings
just like you have.

41:32.074 --> 41:35.110
Happiness, sadness,
anger, love.

41:35.878 --> 41:37.577
Fear.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.579
There's plenty of that
going around.

41:39.581 --> 41:42.015
You're right,
sweet captain.

41:42.017 --> 41:43.517
Our spies tell us that

41:43.519 --> 41:44.985
Mother Ginger
is on the warpath...

41:44.987 --> 41:46.821
gathering all her forces.

41:46.823 --> 41:48.957
The Engine
is the only way

41:48.959 --> 41:51.826
that we can build an army
to defend ourselves.

41:51.828 --> 41:53.660
But it doesn't work.

41:53.662 --> 41:57.167
If we can't get it to work
again, then all is lost.

41:58.234 --> 41:59.833
Perhaps I could fix it.

41:59.835 --> 42:01.235
It's not broken.

42:01.237 --> 42:03.004
We're simply
missing the key.

42:03.006 --> 42:05.173
- Key?
- The key.

42:05.175 --> 42:08.075
We've searched hither and
yon throughout the kingdom.

42:10.181 --> 42:13.149
I fear your dear mother
must have taken it with her.

42:14.651 --> 42:16.252
But she never returned.

42:17.654 --> 42:19.589
A pin tumbler.

42:25.862 --> 42:27.762
Sugar Plum, look.

42:27.764 --> 42:29.629
This was a present
from my mother.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.598
The locks match.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.336
It must be the same key.

42:34.338 --> 42:37.607
This key of which
you speak...

42:38.275 --> 42:39.741
where is it?

42:39.743 --> 42:41.843
That horrible
little mouse took it.

42:41.845 --> 42:43.112
Mouserinks!

42:43.114 --> 42:45.214
He's diabolical.

42:45.216 --> 42:47.749
But that means that
Mother Ginger has it.

42:47.751 --> 42:50.221
Oh, pooh!

42:52.922 --> 42:56.290
Then we can't
make the army...

42:56.292 --> 42:58.127
and we'll be annihilated.

42:58.129 --> 43:00.162
Unless we can bring
the key back.

43:00.164 --> 43:02.231
Get it back?

43:02.233 --> 43:03.932
I could go
to the Fourth Realm.

43:03.934 --> 43:06.335
Oh, no!
It's too, too dangerous!

43:06.337 --> 43:08.771
I came here
to find that key.

43:08.773 --> 43:10.607
Clara, you're not
going back there.

43:13.944 --> 43:16.945
This must be why my mother
sent me here.

43:16.947 --> 43:18.380
I can't let
Mother Ginger destroy

43:18.382 --> 43:19.547
everything she created.

43:19.549 --> 43:22.252
We were lucky to escape
with our lives the last time.

43:22.254 --> 43:24.122
Mother Ginger's more
dangerous than you know.

43:24.822 --> 43:27.058
I must get that key.

44:01.093 --> 44:02.991
You found him.

44:02.993 --> 44:04.160
He's your favorite,
isn't he?

44:04.162 --> 44:06.664
Well, we can't have Christmas
without the nutcracker.

44:07.731 --> 44:10.434
I found him
at Drosselmeyer's.

44:10.436 --> 44:12.735
He reminds me of a land
I discovered

44:12.737 --> 44:14.337
when I was a little girl...

44:14.339 --> 44:17.175
full of sweets and flowers
and the funniest people.

44:18.710 --> 44:20.343
That sounds wonderful.

44:20.345 --> 44:22.212
It was.

44:22.214 --> 44:24.781
Maybe you'll go there too
one day.

44:24.783 --> 44:26.351
Maybe you can
take me there.

44:39.098 --> 44:40.997
Are you all right, Mother?

44:40.999 --> 44:42.335
I'm fine.

44:43.768 --> 44:46.203
I'd love to take you,
my darling.

44:46.205 --> 44:47.939
But there are
some journeys...

44:48.474 --> 44:50.809
you have to go on alone.

44:52.310 --> 44:54.811
Clara, I know
you sometimes wish

44:54.813 --> 44:56.081
you were more like
your sister.

44:57.215 --> 45:00.784
But I love you
because you're so different.

45:00.786 --> 45:05.789
You see the world
in a unique way.

45:05.791 --> 45:07.992
When you realize that's
your greatest strength...

45:07.994 --> 45:11.028
you can change the world,
my girl.

45:11.030 --> 45:13.366
And I'll be watching you.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.369
Now, where are you
going to put him?

45:31.951 --> 45:33.419
It's perfect.

46:16.396 --> 46:18.966
Oh, Mother,
it's so beautiful here.

46:36.484 --> 46:39.886
I don't know
if I can get the key back.

46:41.222 --> 46:42.990
And if I fail...

46:44.091 --> 46:47.428
this whole world
you discovered...

46:55.402 --> 46:57.537
I wish you were here.

47:00.408 --> 47:02.308
So you can tell me
that I'm doing

47:02.310 --> 47:04.110
the right thing
like you used to.

47:26.901 --> 47:28.903
Thank you.

47:48.424 --> 47:50.426
Clara!

47:51.560 --> 47:54.026
Oh, I wish I could
come with you.

47:54.028 --> 47:55.162
You understand.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.431
But you'll have
my tippy-top top-notch

47:57.433 --> 47:59.033
handpicked troops
to protect you.

47:59.635 --> 48:03.271
Good luck, my brave girl.

48:08.076 --> 48:10.444
Your most gracious majesty...

48:10.446 --> 48:12.179
Why are you
talking like that?

48:12.181 --> 48:13.614
- Shh!
- Do it properly.

48:13.616 --> 48:16.616
- Your Majesty, we request...
- Look, we're volunteering.

48:16.618 --> 48:17.853
Yep. That.

48:18.153 --> 48:19.386
You?

48:19.388 --> 48:22.089
Don't say it like that. We're
trained killers, we are.

48:22.091 --> 48:23.423
Deadly.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.694
Attention!

48:27.696 --> 48:29.029
Pick up the dagger!
The dagger!

48:29.031 --> 48:30.564
- By the right...
- Sorry.

48:30.566 --> 48:32.033
...turn!

48:35.672 --> 48:37.207
Squad march.

49:30.326 --> 49:32.126
Remember your training.

49:32.128 --> 49:33.628
Stay alert.

49:33.630 --> 49:35.031
I'm not alert.

49:35.498 --> 49:37.066
I'm scared.

49:48.212 --> 49:50.011
What's going on
up there?

49:50.013 --> 49:51.415
Why have we stopped?

49:52.483 --> 49:55.149
Come on!
It's only a bit of fog!

50:52.476 --> 50:53.744
What was that?

51:12.364 --> 51:13.598
Gather at the carousel!

51:21.841 --> 51:24.509
We can't fight
what we can't see.

51:36.454 --> 51:38.223
It's the mice!
They're under us!

51:49.735 --> 51:51.537
Move it! Move it!

51:56.776 --> 51:57.841
Captain!

52:00.580 --> 52:02.211
Hang on!

52:04.449 --> 52:05.783
Clara!

52:05.785 --> 52:07.552
Let me go!

52:09.856 --> 52:11.555
Clara! Where are you?

52:21.834 --> 52:25.636
<i>Well, if it isn't
Clara Stahlbaum.</i>

52:25.638 --> 52:27.838
<i>I've been expecting you.</i>

52:27.840 --> 52:29.940
I'm here to reclaim
what you've taken from me

52:29.942 --> 52:31.575
and from my mother.

52:31.577 --> 52:32.578
My key!

52:33.311 --> 52:34.815
<i>Please, come in.</i>

52:50.496 --> 52:51.662
Whee!

52:57.704 --> 53:00.438
<i>♪ Clara Stahlbaum
Lovely Clara Stahlbaum ♪</i>

53:00.440 --> 53:02.240
Little Princess Clara.

53:02.242 --> 53:03.644
She looks like a goose!

53:06.546 --> 53:08.482
What a clumsy thing she is.

53:11.685 --> 53:13.217
Look out!

53:16.823 --> 53:18.422
Where are you going?

53:18.424 --> 53:19.425
Leaving so soon?

53:20.694 --> 53:21.927
Step right this way.

53:23.731 --> 53:25.599
We have a surprise for you.

53:28.301 --> 53:30.504
Have a seat.

53:31.405 --> 53:33.571
Bon voyage!

53:33.573 --> 53:34.741
<i>Adios.</i>

53:50.625 --> 53:52.694
Hands off, young lady!

53:57.565 --> 53:59.965
You're Mother Ginger.

53:59.967 --> 54:03.468
And you're Queen Marie's
daughter, apparently.

54:07.842 --> 54:10.309
Yes.

54:10.311 --> 54:13.247
Now, what business brings you
to the Fourth Realm?

54:14.049 --> 54:16.849
Don't you know
it's dangerous here?

54:16.851 --> 54:19.452
I've come to get
what belongs to me.

54:19.454 --> 54:20.953
That key.

54:20.955 --> 54:23.022
If this key
belongs to anyone...

54:23.024 --> 54:24.890
it belongs to your mother.

54:24.892 --> 54:26.525
No.

54:26.527 --> 54:27.793
She left it to me.

54:27.795 --> 54:29.897
Why would she give it to you?

54:31.699 --> 54:33.367
My mother, she...

54:33.936 --> 54:35.637
she passed away.

54:37.606 --> 54:39.440
Queen Marie is dead?

54:40.508 --> 54:42.475
As if you care!

54:42.477 --> 54:43.944
You're trying to
destroy everything

54:43.946 --> 54:45.379
my mother ever created.

55:03.966 --> 55:05.534
Look what you've done
to your own realm.

55:06.969 --> 55:08.101
You've ruined it.

55:08.103 --> 55:09.936
Whee!

55:09.938 --> 55:11.405
Clara!

55:21.985 --> 55:23.617
Look out!

55:23.619 --> 55:26.686
Clara! No!

55:26.688 --> 55:28.557
Whoa.

55:35.964 --> 55:38.031
<i>Bring it back!</i>

55:38.033 --> 55:40.467
Captain! I got the key.

55:40.469 --> 55:41.668
<i>Get back here!</i>

55:41.670 --> 55:43.804
She was different.

55:43.806 --> 55:45.473
Don't be fooled
by that little old lady act.

55:45.475 --> 55:46.440
The woman is deadly.

55:46.442 --> 55:49.544
<i>That's a dangerous key!</i>

55:49.546 --> 55:50.912
Foolish girl.

55:57.619 --> 56:01.721
Our future depends
on that girl, Mouserinks.

56:01.723 --> 56:03.392
To the palace!

56:08.730 --> 56:10.098
Captain...

56:10.100 --> 56:11.632
I need to stop.

56:11.634 --> 56:13.668
I have to open this.
It's important.

56:13.670 --> 56:15.069
All right.

56:15.071 --> 56:17.373
We should be safe here.

56:51.541 --> 56:53.076
It can't be.

56:55.645 --> 56:56.646
No.

57:01.218 --> 57:03.654
It's just a music box.

57:05.055 --> 57:08.657
But my mother told me...

57:08.659 --> 57:12.796
"Everything you need
is inside."

57:16.233 --> 57:18.035
There's nothing here.

57:18.869 --> 57:19.937
There's music.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.508
I thought...

57:25.609 --> 57:28.177
I thought
if I found this key...

57:28.179 --> 57:30.514
then I would find answers...

57:31.849 --> 57:34.118
that everything
would make sense.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.789
I'm just as lost
as when I arrived here.

57:40.858 --> 57:42.491
Here...

57:42.493 --> 57:43.926
take the key.

57:43.928 --> 57:45.895
Bring it to Sugar Plum.

57:45.897 --> 57:47.599
Where are you going?

57:48.667 --> 57:50.066
- Home.
- Home?

57:50.068 --> 57:51.568
But, Clara, we need you here.

57:54.571 --> 57:55.740
No.

57:56.707 --> 57:59.844
Captain, you need my mother.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.182
She was a queen...

58:05.716 --> 58:06.982
and I'm not.

58:06.984 --> 58:08.850
I've never left my post,
you know.

58:08.852 --> 58:10.189
I knew my place.

58:11.523 --> 58:14.090
And I was happy.

58:14.092 --> 58:17.093
But when you told me you were
going into the Fourth Realm...

58:17.095 --> 58:19.128
I knew I'd go with you.

58:19.130 --> 58:21.533
And it wasn't because
you're Marie's daughter...

58:23.234 --> 58:25.702
but because
you have her same look...

58:25.704 --> 58:28.037
of confidence...

58:28.039 --> 58:30.539
and determination.

58:30.541 --> 58:32.875
I don't feel very confident
right now.

58:32.877 --> 58:36.180
You just led a regiment of men
into the Fourth Realm...

58:36.182 --> 58:38.650
and took back this key
from Mother Ginger.

58:39.551 --> 58:42.119
You're not lost,
Clara Stahlbaum.

58:42.121 --> 58:44.589
Your place is here.

58:51.796 --> 58:53.563
Thank you...

58:53.565 --> 58:54.599
Captain.

59:02.174 --> 59:03.876
It's time to save the kingdom.

59:17.890 --> 59:19.023
Clara!

59:19.025 --> 59:20.190
I have it!

59:20.192 --> 59:22.994
You clever girl!
Down, quick!

59:22.996 --> 59:24.264
Quickly!

59:26.099 --> 59:27.332
Finally!

59:27.334 --> 59:30.303
How long I've waited
for this moment!

59:36.343 --> 59:38.244
Wonderful!

59:39.078 --> 59:41.145
Bring me the tin soldiers.

59:43.182 --> 59:45.016
You can't use tin soldiers.

59:45.018 --> 59:47.218
Well, of course I can.
Don't be silly.

59:47.220 --> 59:49.254
You have no idea
how they'll behave.

59:49.256 --> 59:50.755
They're completely hollow.

59:50.757 --> 59:54.092
They'll behave
exactly as I tell them to.

59:54.094 --> 59:56.794
The perfect soldier.

59:56.796 --> 59:58.363
Put them on the platform.

59:58.365 --> 01:00:01.034
It is time to think big.

01:00:08.741 --> 01:00:10.742
Are you sure about this?

01:00:10.744 --> 01:00:12.145
She has to protect
the realms.

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:23.688
Ready, steady, go!

01:00:38.139 --> 01:00:40.208
Hello, boys!

01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:44.742
They're huge!

01:00:44.744 --> 01:00:46.980
I know. Isn't it magnificent?

01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:48.982
Soldiers...

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:51.218
attention!

01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:56.089
Report!

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:05.131
Prepare to march
on the Fourth Realm.

01:01:05.133 --> 01:01:06.332
March on the...

01:01:06.334 --> 01:01:08.467
I thought this army
was to defend us.

01:01:08.469 --> 01:01:11.303
Well, attack is the best
form of defense, my dear.

01:01:11.305 --> 01:01:12.972
My mother wouldn't
have wanted this.

01:01:12.974 --> 01:01:14.806
I don't care
what your mother wanted.

01:01:14.808 --> 01:01:15.977
She's not here.

01:01:17.178 --> 01:01:18.310
I...

01:01:18.312 --> 01:01:20.312
I order you to stop.

01:01:20.314 --> 01:01:23.816
You order me?

01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:24.950
Well, well, well.

01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:27.155
Finally ready to play queen,
are we?

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.390
Too late.

01:01:30.392 --> 01:01:32.191
I only needed you
to bring me the key,

01:01:32.193 --> 01:01:33.460
and now that I have it...

01:01:33.462 --> 01:01:35.995
I have no more use for you.

01:01:35.997 --> 01:01:37.730
Seize them!

01:01:37.732 --> 01:01:38.998
Take your hands off her!

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.933
Oh,
they won't listen to you.

01:01:40.935 --> 01:01:42.301
I gave them life...

01:01:42.303 --> 01:01:44.170
so they'll only listen to me.

01:01:44.172 --> 01:01:45.505
Traitor!

01:01:45.507 --> 01:01:48.108
Why are you doing this?

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.844
Your mother abandoned us.

01:01:51.846 --> 01:01:53.280
And then...

01:01:53.282 --> 01:01:56.049
she just expects us to
carry on and play nice.

01:01:56.051 --> 01:01:58.287
Well, I don't want
to play nice!

01:01:59.754 --> 01:02:03.256
Mother Ginger didn't do
anything wrong, did she?

01:02:03.258 --> 01:02:05.425
You lied to me.

01:02:05.427 --> 01:02:07.092
To everyone.

01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:11.031
But I have a very special plan
for Mother Ginger...

01:02:11.033 --> 01:02:13.001
and the other regents.

01:02:13.436 --> 01:02:14.868
Watch.

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:17.237
Oh, Guard...

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:20.008
will you stand
over there, please?

01:02:21.944 --> 01:02:24.177
Yes, just right
in the center.

01:02:34.057 --> 01:02:35.189
You see...

01:02:35.191 --> 01:02:36.524
there's a funny little perk...

01:02:36.526 --> 01:02:39.093
to your mother's invention.

01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:41.264
It works both ways.

01:02:42.198 --> 01:02:43.797
You are horrible.

01:02:43.799 --> 01:02:46.068
How dare you speak
to your queen that way!

01:02:46.502 --> 01:02:48.136
Guards!

01:02:49.338 --> 01:02:51.006
Lock them up.

01:03:41.057 --> 01:03:42.058
There's no way to escape.

01:03:44.928 --> 01:03:46.128
Get your hands
off of me! Don't touch me!

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.562
- Hands off!
- How dare you!

01:03:47.564 --> 01:03:49.164
I've never been
treated like this...

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.299
in all my life.

01:03:50.301 --> 01:03:52.301
Get off! Oh, my God!

01:03:52.303 --> 01:03:54.869
Alas...

01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:56.238
you're here as well,
my dear.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.639
What's happening?

01:03:57.641 --> 01:03:59.341
What's Sugar Plum doing?

01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:01.909
Why are we
locked up here?

01:04:01.911 --> 01:04:03.612
It's all my fault.

01:04:03.614 --> 01:04:05.079
I've let you all down.

01:04:05.081 --> 01:04:06.981
No. No.

01:04:06.983 --> 01:04:08.617
Clara, that's not true.

01:04:08.619 --> 01:04:10.285
Sugar Plum lied to us.

01:04:10.287 --> 01:04:12.220
But I gave her the key...

01:04:12.222 --> 01:04:14.323
and now she's going to use it
to destroy the realms...

01:04:14.325 --> 01:04:16.024
and everything
that my mother loved.

01:04:16.026 --> 01:04:18.160
- Clara, listen to me.
- No!

01:04:18.162 --> 01:04:19.961
I wanted to go home...

01:04:19.963 --> 01:04:21.563
but you stopped me...

01:04:21.565 --> 01:04:23.434
and now
I've ruined everything.

01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.216
This is more like it.

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:40.583
A proper army.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.117
To create discipline...

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:44.088
order, control.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:47.623
Boys in uniform with weapons.

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:49.627
Sends a quiver
right through me.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:40.311
"Everything you need
is inside."

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.121
It's me.

01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:55.561
Captain.

01:05:57.696 --> 01:05:59.563
I'm sorry for blaming you.

01:05:59.565 --> 01:06:01.600
This is all my fault,
and I'm going to fix it.

01:06:03.368 --> 01:06:05.134
Will you help me?

01:06:07.071 --> 01:06:08.406
Please?

01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:12.276
Of course I will.

01:06:12.278 --> 01:06:13.345
Nutcrackers are very loyal.

01:06:14.246 --> 01:06:16.015
You are indeed.

01:06:18.117 --> 01:06:19.218
Are you ready?

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.187
Ready.

01:06:21.754 --> 01:06:23.155
Go!

01:06:30.095 --> 01:06:31.095
I'm sorry.

01:06:36.068 --> 01:06:37.069
A little more.

01:06:38.805 --> 01:06:41.338
A bit more.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.641
My dear, that doesn't
look very secure.

01:06:43.643 --> 01:06:45.175
You can't.

01:06:45.177 --> 01:06:47.110
It's not gonna work.

01:06:47.112 --> 01:06:49.213
It's just the laws of physics.

01:06:49.215 --> 01:06:51.114
Do those laws always work?

01:06:51.116 --> 01:06:52.418
Always.

01:06:55.287 --> 01:06:57.090
As far as I know.

01:06:59.159 --> 01:07:00.658
Ready.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.028
Ready.

01:07:04.798 --> 01:07:05.966
Go!

01:07:08.401 --> 01:07:09.669
Whoa!

01:07:15.408 --> 01:07:16.676
Clara.

01:07:22.517 --> 01:07:23.582
That's more like it.

01:07:23.584 --> 01:07:24.717
There she is.

01:07:24.719 --> 01:07:26.150
Out with the old...

01:07:26.152 --> 01:07:27.385
in with the new.

01:07:27.387 --> 01:07:29.356
Gather at the gate.

01:07:30.223 --> 01:07:32.158
Wait for my command.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.162
Jog on, boys.

01:07:39.232 --> 01:07:40.534
She's going.

01:07:44.805 --> 01:07:47.740
I have to get to the
Engine Room and stop this.

01:07:53.447 --> 01:07:54.780
We can't get in this way.

01:07:56.617 --> 01:07:58.084
Mouserinks.

01:07:58.886 --> 01:08:01.620
- Get out of here!
- Wait!

01:08:01.622 --> 01:08:03.421
I think he's trying
to tell us something.

01:08:05.492 --> 01:08:06.661
Quickly.

01:08:41.563 --> 01:08:43.295
Thank you
for your help.

01:08:44.432 --> 01:08:46.599
Can you get us
to the Engine Room?

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.533
Are you sure
we can trust him?

01:08:50.438 --> 01:08:51.569
Don't start with me,
mouse!

01:08:51.572 --> 01:08:53.339
All right, stop!

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:54.908
We don't have much time.

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:56.643
We need to work together.

01:08:58.714 --> 01:08:59.781
Show us.

01:09:17.733 --> 01:09:19.265
Where'd he go?

01:09:20.703 --> 01:09:22.170
This way!

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:44.323
We should be able
to ride the wheels

01:09:44.326 --> 01:09:45.626
up to the Engine Room.

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:46.894
All right...

01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:48.763
- I'll go first.
- No!

01:09:48.765 --> 01:09:50.363
You have to warn
Mother Ginger.

01:09:50.366 --> 01:09:52.232
Those soldiers will be heading
to the Fourth Realm.

01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:53.934
What? I'm not going
to leave you, Clara.

01:09:53.935 --> 01:09:55.903
I can handle this.

01:09:55.905 --> 01:09:57.439
You have to trust me. Please.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.676
I do.

01:10:02.779 --> 01:10:04.644
Can you take the captain
to Mother Ginger?

01:10:10.553 --> 01:10:11.953
Thank you.

01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:15.489
Be careful.

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:17.460
That's an order, Captain.

01:10:36.046 --> 01:10:39.413
Thank you, Captain.

01:10:39.415 --> 01:10:41.652
Please, Clara,
call me Phillip.

01:10:42.518 --> 01:10:43.887
Thank you, Phillip.

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:54.495
Let's go, mouse.

01:10:54.497 --> 01:10:55.863
Lead the way.

01:10:58.969 --> 01:11:00.769
I don't speak rodent.

01:11:51.589 --> 01:11:52.590
Mother Ginger!

01:11:55.492 --> 01:11:56.527
Oh.

01:12:07.571 --> 01:12:09.072
Wait!

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:10.974
I come as a friend.

01:12:10.976 --> 01:12:12.508
Look.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.081
Let him through!

01:12:22.053 --> 01:12:24.053
- Where's Clara?
- In the palace.

01:12:24.055 --> 01:12:26.455
But she has a plan.
Please, Mother Ginger.

01:12:26.457 --> 01:12:28.691
Sugar Plum has built an army
to conquer all the realms.

01:12:28.693 --> 01:12:29.994
They're coming for you.

01:12:31.428 --> 01:12:34.631
Sugar Plum thinks
she's divided us all.

01:12:34.633 --> 01:12:37.768
But a long time ago we both
took an oath to our queen...

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.870
to defend the realms
no matter the cost.

01:12:41.841 --> 01:12:44.842
Are you still willing
to uphold that oath?

01:12:44.844 --> 01:12:46.811
No matter the cost,
I'm ready.

01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:49.614
Brave nutcracker.

01:12:50.548 --> 01:12:52.149
So now...

01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:55.120
we must draw
Sugar Plum to us.

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:31.015
Forget those
ludicrous clowns!

01:14:31.017 --> 01:14:33.518
I want Mother Ginger!

01:15:54.702 --> 01:15:57.237
Victory is ours!

01:15:57.239 --> 01:15:59.272
Come out, Mother Ginger!

01:16:06.148 --> 01:16:07.946
The nutcracker?

01:16:07.948 --> 01:16:09.649
Were you expecting
someone else?

01:16:09.651 --> 01:16:11.184
Where is she?

01:16:13.789 --> 01:16:15.991
Oh!

01:16:16.658 --> 01:16:17.891
Mother Ginger!

01:16:17.893 --> 01:16:19.392
At your service,
Your Majesty!

01:16:19.394 --> 01:16:20.595
Duck!

01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:25.901
Destroy him!

01:16:26.968 --> 01:16:29.071
You heard her.
Come and get me.

01:16:34.043 --> 01:16:36.010
I can disable the Engine.

01:16:36.012 --> 01:16:37.712
Go! I'll take care
of this lot.

01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:07.777
No matter the cost.
I'm ready.

01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:13.447
Mouserinks.

01:17:16.152 --> 01:17:18.018
Come on, you tin cans.

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.255
Let's settle this like men.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.869
Clara! Please, hurry!

01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:56.491
Mother Ginger,
I'm just so pleased...

01:17:56.493 --> 01:17:58.994
you decided to drop in.

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:02.164
Mouserinks...

01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:03.731
don't let them split us up.

01:18:03.733 --> 01:18:04.901
Stay with me.

01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:37.033
You just had to interfere
again, didn't you?

01:18:37.035 --> 01:18:39.302
I stopped you once before,
remember?

01:18:39.304 --> 01:18:41.836
You merely delayed
the inevitable.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.241
The princess...

01:18:45.243 --> 01:18:46.942
where is she?

01:18:46.944 --> 01:18:48.277
She's gone!

01:18:48.279 --> 01:18:50.879
She's fled the realm.
She's safe from you!

01:18:50.881 --> 01:18:54.849
Then I'm the queen
of the castle...

01:18:54.851 --> 01:18:59.255
and you're a dirty rascal.

01:18:59.257 --> 01:19:01.726
This is madness, Sugar Plum!
It has to stop!

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.360
Put her on the platform.

01:19:04.362 --> 01:19:05.928
Sugar Plum...

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:07.764
I know you miss Marie.

01:19:08.433 --> 01:19:10.299
We all do.

01:19:10.301 --> 01:19:12.901
But this isn't gonna
make you feel any better!

01:19:12.903 --> 01:19:14.570
Banishing you
to the Fourth Realm...

01:19:14.572 --> 01:19:17.039
made me feel just...

01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:18.174
delicious.

01:19:18.176 --> 01:19:19.275
But this...

01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:23.946
this is going to be...

01:19:23.948 --> 01:19:26.518
exquisite.

01:19:27.252 --> 01:19:28.485
<i>Adieu.</i>

01:19:28.487 --> 01:19:29.488
Farewell.

01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:31.821
Goodbye.

01:19:31.823 --> 01:19:33.322
Sugar Plum, stop!

01:19:33.324 --> 01:19:35.925
Clara, run!
Get out of here!

01:19:35.927 --> 01:19:37.262
Seize her!

01:19:41.199 --> 01:19:43.099
For the princess,
my friend...

01:19:43.101 --> 01:19:44.268
and the realms.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.040
Don't do this.

01:19:50.042 --> 01:19:52.242
My mother loved you.

01:19:52.244 --> 01:19:54.378
You had a special place
in her heart.

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:57.581
You, of all people,
should understand, Clara.

01:19:57.583 --> 01:19:59.349
She left you alone, too.

01:19:59.351 --> 01:20:00.352
No.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:04.122
She left me everything I need.

01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.557
I'm not alone.

01:20:07.559 --> 01:20:10.262
Sugar Plum,
we are not alone.

01:20:11.397 --> 01:20:13.065
You're right.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:19.104
I have a big, beautiful army
to protect me.

01:20:22.141 --> 01:20:24.641
No one will hurt me
ever again.

01:20:24.643 --> 01:20:26.512
I know you're angry.

01:20:27.579 --> 01:20:30.213
But you can still do
the right thing.

01:20:30.215 --> 01:20:32.116
Sugar Plum, listen to her.

01:20:32.118 --> 01:20:34.387
This isn't what
Marie wanted for us.

01:20:35.055 --> 01:20:36.354
For us?

01:20:36.356 --> 01:20:40.291
A true queen does
what's best for herself.

01:20:44.431 --> 01:20:45.463
No.

01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:49.600
A true queen does
what's best for her people.

01:20:53.939 --> 01:20:55.673
And you were right,
Sugar Plum.

01:20:55.675 --> 01:20:59.045
I am every inch
my mother's daughter.

01:21:03.116 --> 01:21:05.352
Clara, what have you done?

01:21:26.306 --> 01:21:27.874
She did it.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.713
Let me go.

01:21:39.586 --> 01:21:40.887
Mouserinks.

01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:43.956
Clara did it.

01:21:47.428 --> 01:21:49.196
Mother Ginger?

01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:55.068
Well done, Clara.

01:22:39.213 --> 01:22:42.247
Clara, it's over.
We are saved.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:45.552
Peace is restored.
The realms are reunited.

01:22:45.554 --> 01:22:49.556
And it's all because of you,
my dear.

01:22:49.558 --> 01:22:50.757
This all could have
been avoided

01:22:50.759 --> 01:22:52.625
if only I listened to you,
Mother Ginger.

01:22:52.627 --> 01:22:55.127
Oh, it's not your fault.

01:22:55.129 --> 01:22:56.731
No one else did either.

01:22:58.433 --> 01:23:01.434
Your mother would be very
proud of you, my dear.

01:23:01.436 --> 01:23:03.071
Very proud.

01:23:04.406 --> 01:23:07.273
Captain Nutcracker,
would you escort Clara

01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:08.508
to the Christmas
Tree Forest...

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:10.743
and then return
in your new post

01:23:10.745 --> 01:23:12.347
as Captain of the Guard.

01:23:15.684 --> 01:23:17.249
What about your bridge?

01:23:17.251 --> 01:23:19.117
I'm afraid I'd be lonely.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:20.788
I suppose I have you
to thank for that.

01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:22.456
I suppose you do.

01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:24.758
And besides, I have
a new friend now.

01:23:52.822 --> 01:23:53.888
Your Majesty.

01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:58.126
Your Highness. And brave
Captain Nutcracker.

01:24:00.128 --> 01:24:02.763
It is an honor to serve
at your post, sir.

01:24:02.765 --> 01:24:04.767
Keep up the good work, men.

01:24:10.741 --> 01:24:13.674
On three.
One, two, three.

01:24:19.782 --> 01:24:21.582
You've really put on weight.

01:24:36.667 --> 01:24:38.533
Please come back
to the realms one day.

01:24:38.535 --> 01:24:41.302
Oh, of course I will.

01:24:41.304 --> 01:24:43.470
Or maybe one day,
you could come to my world.

01:24:43.472 --> 01:24:45.539
You can meet my family.

01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:46.808
Are they like you?

01:24:47.911 --> 01:24:49.545
Well, they're a bit different.

01:24:52.481 --> 01:24:54.481
I'm going to miss you.

01:24:54.483 --> 01:24:55.619
I'll miss you too.

01:24:57.321 --> 01:25:00.557
But when you miss someone,
you remember them.

01:25:02.526 --> 01:25:04.526
Are you sure?

01:25:04.528 --> 01:25:07.197
And one day
that'll make you smile.

01:25:09.633 --> 01:25:11.401
I promise you.

01:25:14.605 --> 01:25:15.606
Goodbye, Clara.

01:25:17.306 --> 01:25:18.575
Goodbye.

01:25:52.644 --> 01:25:53.811
Clara?

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.712
There you are.

01:25:56.714 --> 01:25:57.947
Back so soon?

01:25:57.949 --> 01:25:59.414
Thank you.

01:25:59.416 --> 01:26:01.584
Ah.

01:26:01.586 --> 01:26:03.585
Pin tumbler locks.

01:26:03.587 --> 01:26:05.955
Devilish things
to get into, aren't they?

01:26:05.957 --> 01:26:09.960
I worked it out.
Eventually.

01:26:09.962 --> 01:26:12.563
Hmm. I knew you would.

01:26:14.365 --> 01:26:16.632
Clara...

01:26:16.634 --> 01:26:21.606
your mother was the cleverest
inventor I ever knew.

01:26:23.274 --> 01:26:25.574
And there was
never any doubt

01:26:25.576 --> 01:26:28.613
when I asked what
her greatest creation was.

01:26:31.617 --> 01:26:33.217
It was you.

01:26:51.836 --> 01:26:53.536
Clara.

01:26:53.538 --> 01:26:56.608
Father, I'm so sorry.

01:27:01.714 --> 01:27:02.881
I'm sorry.

01:27:06.752 --> 01:27:08.420
I'm sorry.

01:27:09.488 --> 01:27:12.288
This time has been
extremely difficult...

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:13.759
for all of us.

01:27:16.495 --> 01:27:21.000
I lost the love of my life,
and you lost your mother.

01:27:22.434 --> 01:27:26.238
And I will miss her
every day of my life.

01:27:29.075 --> 01:27:32.910
But I don't want to miss
one more minute...

01:27:32.912 --> 01:27:35.781
with you, or Louise,
or Fritz.

01:27:48.762 --> 01:27:50.295
Shall we go home?

01:27:51.498 --> 01:27:52.966
Don't you owe me
a dance first?

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:57.904
After all, it's what's
expected of us.

01:27:58.872 --> 01:28:00.774
I suppose I do.

01:28:02.608 --> 01:28:04.008
Ah, you've opened it.

01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:05.912
Wasn't so hard after all.

01:28:18.758 --> 01:28:19.759
What is it?

01:28:21.528 --> 01:28:23.361
This is the very song
that your mother and I

01:28:23.363 --> 01:28:24.764
first danced to.

01:28:44.051 --> 01:28:45.383
May we join you?

01:28:45.385 --> 01:28:46.653
I want to dance.

01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:48.855
Please do.
