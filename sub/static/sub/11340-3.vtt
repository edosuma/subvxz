This cream is a miracle.

00:14.411 --> 00:16.996
My fine lines
and sagging skin are gone.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.582
I look like
a different person.

00:57.153 --> 00:59.538
Hey! Bro!

00:59.623 --> 01:00.790
Thanks for the referral.

01:00.841 --> 01:03.459
Painting the Smith house today.

01:37.744 --> 01:40.362
Hey, it's me.

01:40.414 --> 01:42.248
Heads up.

01:42.332 --> 01:45.301
Someone's got eyes on us.

01:45.368 --> 01:47.169
I need to come in.

01:52.542 --> 01:55.377
Synalock. May I help you?

01:58.732 --> 02:01.301
He's on a conference call,
but he should be off

02:01.326 --> 02:02.526
in a few minutes.

02:02.536 --> 02:06.072
Mr. Werner's not available.
Can I have him return?

02:06.156 --> 02:08.741
Thank you.

02:09.893 --> 02:11.777
What?

02:11.862 --> 02:12.995
You changed your hair.

02:13.063 --> 02:16.248
No. Not really.

02:18.085 --> 02:20.419
Hey. Just give me a second.

02:20.504 --> 02:22.738
What do I have this morning?

02:22.789 --> 02:24.006
Ok, move London
to 12:30

02:24.074 --> 02:26.342
and reschedule lunch
with Caldwell.

02:26.409 --> 02:28.127
So, what's going on?

02:28.211 --> 02:32.081
I don't know.
You tell me.

02:36.937 --> 02:38.437
Don't shoot!

02:38.522 --> 02:40.523
It's today?

02:40.590 --> 02:43.359
I can't.
I've got a big meeting.

02:43.426 --> 02:45.194
Fine. Put her on.

02:45.261 --> 02:47.196
Hi, sweetheart.

02:47.263 --> 02:48.931
I know.

02:48.982 --> 02:53.102
Ok. Well, mom's gonna
record the pageant.

02:53.153 --> 02:56.405
I know. I wish
I could be there, too.

02:56.456 --> 02:59.274
Ok. Break a leg, honey.

03:28.655 --> 03:30.940
Hey, good morning.

03:30.991 --> 03:33.492
Oh, look at you
spoiling me. Thank you.

03:33.577 --> 03:34.577
Where's yours?

03:34.644 --> 03:36.162
Oh, I quit caffeine.

03:36.246 --> 03:37.830
Trying to relax more.

03:37.914 --> 03:39.331
Well, don't relax
too much.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.666
You got 10 hours
of takedown

03:40.751 --> 03:42.501
and arrest procedure
training to recertify.

03:42.586 --> 03:43.502
Since when?

03:43.587 --> 03:44.620
Since the hearing.

03:44.671 --> 03:46.272
Am I the only one?

03:46.339 --> 03:47.840
Prentiss,
you've been away.

03:47.908 --> 03:49.842
Oh, yeah. I guess
I can't complain.

03:49.926 --> 03:52.378
Well, especially
not to your trainer.

03:52.462 --> 03:53.679
Oh! You're doing it?

03:53.764 --> 03:55.347
Don't get too excited.
I'm about to put you

03:55.432 --> 03:57.683
through the wringer.
You can believe that.

04:00.637 --> 04:01.887
Workplace massacre
this morning

04:01.972 --> 04:03.139
at Synalock Incorporated.

04:03.190 --> 04:04.140
That's in Charlottesville,

04:04.191 --> 04:06.008
which is practically
our own backyard.

04:06.059 --> 04:07.643
That's a high body count.

04:07.694 --> 04:08.811
Yeah, 8 victims in total.

04:08.862 --> 04:10.679
All employees,
including the CEO.

04:10.730 --> 04:12.465
5 were shot,
3 were stabbed to death.

04:12.532 --> 04:14.784
A gun and a knife.
That's highly unusual.

04:14.851 --> 04:16.786
It could be two killers.

04:16.853 --> 04:19.188
That would be the first time
for a workplace killing.

04:19.238 --> 04:21.957
Their business is Internet
security for corporations.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.576
They didn't have video
surveillance?

04:23.660 --> 04:24.994
They just moved into
a new building.

04:25.045 --> 04:26.996
They didn't have time
to set up their system yet.

04:27.047 --> 04:29.331
How is it no one heard
or saw anything?

04:29.382 --> 04:31.333
This killer was prepared.

04:31.384 --> 04:33.803
Highly organized.
This was premeditated.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.504
He kept his emotions contained.

04:35.555 --> 04:37.990
Pretty hard to do for
the typical workplace killer

04:38.058 --> 04:40.976
who's mentally ill or outraged
about some perceived injustice.

04:41.044 --> 04:42.011
The high body count

04:42.062 --> 04:44.213
indicates
a hell of a lot of rage.

04:44.264 --> 04:47.516
One employee, John Owen,
was MIA.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.819
Local P.D. haven't been
able to locate him yet.

04:49.886 --> 04:51.687
Any unhappy clients?

04:51.738 --> 04:54.056
Or a domestic situation
among the employees?

04:54.107 --> 04:56.192
Don't know, but your
friendly neighborhood genius girl

04:56.243 --> 04:57.526
will find out.

04:57.577 --> 04:58.944
Bottom line is
a mass killing

04:59.029 --> 05:00.279
is a classic
show of force.

05:00.363 --> 05:01.780
It's a way
to become known.

05:01.865 --> 05:04.617
Which is why suicide, often by cop,
is usually part of the plan.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.235
So where's the unsub?

05:06.286 --> 05:09.038
He has a reason
to stay hidden.

05:09.089 --> 05:10.756
He's not finished yet.

Agent Hotchner?
I'm Trooper Long

06:04.549 --> 06:05.982
from the Bureau of
Crime Investigation.

06:06.034 --> 06:07.534
Appreciate you
coming so quickly.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.487
Absolutely. These are Agents
Rossi and Jareau and Dr. Reid.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.489
So a Fed Ex carrier
called it in?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.957
At 8:03, on his
early route.

06:14.008 --> 06:15.659
No one expect to go to work
and never come home,

06:15.710 --> 06:17.906
but today at Synalock,
a new company providing

06:17.931 --> 06:18.995
Internet security...

06:18.996 --> 06:21.148
After the news broke,
half the town called in sick.

06:21.216 --> 06:22.149
Understandable.

06:22.217 --> 06:23.617
The media's in a frenzy.

06:23.685 --> 06:25.969
A press briefing from you guys
would calm them down.

06:26.020 --> 06:28.555
Of course. As soon as
we make our assessment.

06:29.858 --> 06:32.726
So what do we know about
the missing employee so far?

06:32.811 --> 06:34.061
Apparently
he's a programmer.

06:34.145 --> 06:36.113
We have
an unconfirmed report

06:36.180 --> 06:38.348
of a neighbor seeing his car
near his home this morning.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.318
You said the CEO's office
was ransacked?

06:41.369 --> 06:42.853
Yes. Adam Werner's office.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.538
JJ.

06:45.740 --> 06:47.875
This is the first
victim we found,

06:47.959 --> 06:48.876
Nathan Munz.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.360
The position of the body
suggests

06:50.428 --> 06:51.829
he was one of
the last ones killed.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.299
He tried to escape
and almost made it to the exit.

06:55.366 --> 06:58.669
Jane Burney and Vinia Dev
were here.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.637
Jane tried to run,
Vinia didn't.

07:00.705 --> 07:01.972
How do you know?

07:02.039 --> 07:03.640
She's half under her desk,

07:03.708 --> 07:06.543
which means she tried to hide
and the unsub found her.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.981
So these 3 were stabbed

07:11.048 --> 07:13.150
and the rest
were shot to death.

07:13.217 --> 07:14.685
Have you considered
two killers?

07:14.736 --> 07:16.353
Yes, but the bloody
footprints

07:16.404 --> 07:18.889
all seem to come from
the same pair of shoes.

07:18.957 --> 07:21.325
Given the violence, if there
were a second killer,

07:21.392 --> 07:23.160
he'd be hard-pressed to get away
without leaving tracks.

07:23.227 --> 07:24.394
If there was only
one unsub,

07:24.445 --> 07:26.330
he used his gun first,
emptied his magazine,

07:26.397 --> 07:28.782
didn't have a replacement,
and resorted to using his knife.

07:28.867 --> 07:31.118
He'd have to be physically fit or
at least intimidating enough

07:31.202 --> 07:32.336
to subdue so many people.

07:32.403 --> 07:33.837
If this were highly
premeditated,

07:33.905 --> 07:35.506
he would have brought enough
ammunition to kill everyone.

07:35.573 --> 07:36.874
Unless he had
a single target.

07:36.925 --> 07:39.075
He killed the rest of them
because they were witnesses.

07:39.127 --> 07:42.296
We need to figure out
who his first victim was.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.681
These are contracts
Synalock had.

07:44.749 --> 07:46.750
What was the unsub looking for?

07:46.801 --> 07:49.686
Maybe he was a client
searching for his own contract

07:49.754 --> 07:52.589
to hide any connection
to Synalock after the murders.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.392
Ah, everything's digital these days,
though. The hard copy's just a backup.

07:55.443 --> 07:58.645
So the unsub's looking for
an object, an old record,

07:58.730 --> 08:01.448
something
not on a computer.

08:01.533 --> 08:04.601
Huh. Rossi, check this out.

08:06.738 --> 08:10.157
So, uh, Werner was worried enough
about his safety to be armed.

08:10.241 --> 08:12.209
And he didn't have time
to go for his gun

08:12.276 --> 08:15.045
or didn't perceive
the threat to be immediate.

08:15.112 --> 08:18.999
Or keeping a gun around
was out of force of habit.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.334
He was a veteran.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.169
A naval officer
by the looks of it.

08:22.253 --> 08:24.137
A decorated one at that.

08:24.222 --> 08:27.257
He was awarded
the Navy Cross in 2000.

08:28.793 --> 08:30.627
Something else
used to be here.

08:32.897 --> 08:35.015
Another picture frame.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.484
Blood splatter overlay patterns

08:37.568 --> 08:41.154
indicate victim number 3
was over here.

08:41.239 --> 08:44.458
Victim number 2 right here.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.693
And finally victim number one
right here.

08:46.778 --> 08:49.947
- Adam Werner was killed first?
- Looks that way.

08:49.998 --> 08:51.949
Which means the unsub made it all the
way in here without alarming anyone.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.533
He wasn't threatening.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.953
That's why Werner didn't pull
the gun we found in his office.

08:56.004 --> 08:57.871
He could have been
the missing employee.

08:57.956 --> 09:00.156
He may have taken that photo
from his office if he was in it.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.625
Why would an employee

09:01.676 --> 09:04.544
be interested
in Synalock's contracts?

09:04.629 --> 09:06.129
Maybe this is about
one client.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.298
He could be after specific
company information.

09:08.349 --> 09:10.767
He had another motive
besides killing.

09:17.191 --> 09:18.141
Hello.

09:18.192 --> 09:19.476
Dad, it's me.

09:19.527 --> 09:22.178
Hey, Luke. Your mother and I
were just talking about you.

09:22.230 --> 09:23.635
Dad, listen to me.
Has anyone called you,

09:23.660 --> 09:24.860
asked you any questions?

09:25.466 --> 09:26.783
About what?

09:26.851 --> 09:29.119
About me.

09:29.186 --> 09:30.487
No. What's this about?

09:30.538 --> 09:31.655
There's a situation.

09:31.706 --> 09:33.123
What sort of situation?

09:33.190 --> 09:35.125
I'll tell you about it
when I see you.

09:35.192 --> 09:37.461
In the meantime, don't answer
your phone or your door, ok?

09:37.528 --> 09:38.662
Why?

09:38.713 --> 09:40.998
I'm on my way there now.

09:47.555 --> 09:49.806
You've reached Jenna.
Leave a message.

09:49.874 --> 09:52.375
Hey, it's Luke.

09:52.427 --> 09:55.595
Uh, look, I know
you don't want to hear from me.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.597
But something's come up
and I need to know

09:57.682 --> 09:59.933
that you and ally are safe, ok?

10:00.018 --> 10:02.235
Call me. Bye.

10:03.271 --> 10:04.888
It was clean and fast.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.390
He sliced through the left carotid
and abdominal aorta,

10:07.442 --> 10:09.326
major arteries
that would bleed out quickly.

10:09.393 --> 10:11.328
Killed with an economy
of motion.

10:11.395 --> 10:13.830
Yes. And all 3 stab victims
had similar wounds.

10:13.898 --> 10:15.532
What about
the shooting victims?

10:15.583 --> 10:17.534
They all took two .45s
to the chest,

10:17.585 --> 10:20.787
except for Adam Werner.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.125
He took 4 body shots
and one to the head,

10:25.209 --> 10:26.126
execution style.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.344
Definite overkill.

10:27.411 --> 10:29.179
Somebody was angry
with the boss.

10:29.246 --> 10:30.547
Somebody with
hunting skills.

10:30.598 --> 10:32.215
Or a law enforcement
background?

10:32.266 --> 10:33.800
Thank you.

10:39.256 --> 10:41.358
Mom? Dad?

10:41.425 --> 10:43.093
Hey, Luke.

10:43.144 --> 10:44.394
There you are.
Mother's upstairs.

10:44.445 --> 10:46.429
She was worried
that something happened.

10:46.481 --> 10:48.115
It's good to see you,
buddy.

10:49.617 --> 10:51.451
Dad?

10:53.621 --> 10:56.206
What have you done
to my father?

10:56.273 --> 10:58.575
What are you talking about?
I'm right here.

10:58.626 --> 11:01.411
I'm right here.

11:01.462 --> 11:03.113
What's wrong?

11:04.999 --> 11:06.416
Is this about the mission?

11:06.467 --> 11:07.667
What mission?

11:07.752 --> 11:09.920
What's wrong with you?

11:09.971 --> 11:11.188
Aah!

11:11.255 --> 11:13.924
What have you done
to my father?

11:15.143 --> 11:16.877
Talk to me, little genie.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.179
Well, since you know
how to rub my lamp,

11:19.263 --> 11:20.564
your wish is my command.

11:20.631 --> 11:22.933
I checked the Synalock
client list,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.052
and the Defense Intelligence
Agency is new to them,

11:25.119 --> 11:26.469
so there really isn't
anything to report,

11:26.521 --> 11:28.939
and everyone else is crazy
happy with their service.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.274
No complaints logged online?

11:31.325 --> 11:33.443
Zero. I'm talking every
high-tech blog,

11:33.494 --> 11:35.112
every chat room,
glowing accolades.

11:35.163 --> 11:37.280
No one had anything contrary
to say about Synalock.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.750
Any employees have a history of
domestic disturbances

11:39.817 --> 11:41.084
or stalkers?

11:41.152 --> 11:44.320
Not that I'd violate privacy
laws to check, she says,

11:44.372 --> 11:45.539
but the answer is no.

11:45.623 --> 11:47.323
So Synalock is clean.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.658
Mm-hmm. As a whistle.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.210
Which reminds me...

11:50.278 --> 11:52.095
You know how to whistle,
don't you?

11:52.163 --> 11:54.381
You just put your lips
together

11:54.465 --> 11:56.950
and blow.

11:57.018 --> 11:59.836
I love it when you talk
old movies. Later, baby girl.

12:01.189 --> 12:02.672
With all the overkill
on Werner,

12:02.723 --> 12:04.674
there's got to be
a personal connection.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.160
We've located John Owen,
the missing employee.

12:07.228 --> 12:09.393
He's been at a Doctor Who
convention in San Diego

12:09.418 --> 12:10.618
since Saturday.

12:10.815 --> 12:11.948
It was a scheduled
vacation.

12:12.016 --> 12:13.817
Lucky guy.

12:13.868 --> 12:15.836
I'll say. That's supposed
to be an awesome convention.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.021
So if it wasn't someone
connected to the workplace,

12:18.072 --> 12:19.122
who is it?

12:19.190 --> 12:20.791
You know, given the precision
of the kills,

12:20.858 --> 12:22.125
it could be someone
with a military background.

12:22.193 --> 12:24.861
Or a professional hired
by a business competitor.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.313
A hit man
would just kill Werner.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.965
Killing the entire office
seems unprofessional.

12:29.033 --> 12:30.834
Werner was a Navy veteran.

12:30.885 --> 12:32.969
He had D.I.A. contracts.
He had close ties to the military.

12:33.037 --> 12:35.499
It could be someone from his
past harboring an old grudge.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.208
Trooper, issue a <i>Be on The Lookout</i>
to law enforcement

12:38.259 --> 12:41.044
for a physically fit male in his
30s to 40s, possibly a veteran.

12:41.095 --> 12:43.546
He appears nonthreatening
and blends in easily.

12:43.598 --> 12:45.215
He's armed and extremely
dangerous.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.651
He most likely will kill again,

12:47.718 --> 12:50.036
either himself or others,
very soon.

13:10.091 --> 13:12.242
Uhh!

13:12.293 --> 13:14.544
What do you know
about Dorado Falls?

13:14.595 --> 13:17.013
Nothing. Is this
because of Jenna?

13:17.081 --> 13:18.849
What did you
do to Jenna?

13:18.916 --> 13:20.583
Luke, please, stop this,
I'm begging you,

13:20.635 --> 13:22.352
your mother,
her heart is weak.

13:22.419 --> 13:23.753
Whatever's wrong,
we'll help you.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.421
This is your last chance.

13:25.473 --> 13:28.024
You tell me where Mark
and Mary Dolan are.

13:28.092 --> 13:30.277
I'm Mark Dolan.
I'm your father.

13:30.361 --> 13:33.897
For the love of God!
Please, Luke,

13:33.948 --> 13:36.533
we're your parents.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.235
Luke...

13:38.286 --> 13:41.371
Luke, please!
For the love of God, please.

13:41.438 --> 13:44.207
Please, Luke! I'm Mark Dolan!
I'm your father!

13:44.275 --> 13:45.375
For God's sake!

14:06.533 --> 14:09.118
Are we sure the unsub
is their son?

14:09.203 --> 14:10.920
Luke Dolan called Synalock
early this morning.

14:11.004 --> 14:12.789
Garcia confirmed it.

14:14.007 --> 14:19.629
Know many 60-year-olds
with a boom box?

14:25.769 --> 14:27.937
Trying to mask the sound
of the gunshots?

14:28.021 --> 14:31.524
Could be. Or he was
torturing them with sound.

14:31.591 --> 14:34.026
Why were they bound
and gagged in the closet?

14:34.094 --> 14:36.529
Why not just kill them
right away?

14:36.596 --> 14:39.148
Maybe he was trying
to get information from them.

14:39.233 --> 14:40.900
About what?

14:43.454 --> 14:44.787
Go ahead, Garcia,
you're on speaker.

14:44.872 --> 14:47.356
Ok, Luke Dolan was
in the same Navy unit

14:47.424 --> 14:50.376
as our CEO Adam Werner.
That would be the 212th.

14:50.444 --> 14:54.213
They were both communication
clerks at Camp Patriot in Kuwait.

14:54.281 --> 14:56.215
I'm sending all this information
to your emails now.

14:56.283 --> 14:57.717
Any other family?

14:57.784 --> 14:59.051
He has a wife, Jenna.
They've been separated for years.

14:59.119 --> 15:00.753
She lives in Bethesda
with her 8-year-old daughter.

15:00.804 --> 15:02.499
We need to bring her in
for protective custody

15:02.500 --> 15:03.301
and to interview her.

15:03.307 --> 15:05.258
Send local P.D. and have
our nearest unit meet them.

15:05.309 --> 15:06.342
Done and done.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.462
Ok, it looks like
he served 13 years,

15:09.513 --> 15:12.131
honorable discharge
in 2005.

15:12.182 --> 15:14.600
And now a VP
of a biotech company.

15:14.651 --> 15:16.085
He was never
a Synalock employee.

15:16.153 --> 15:17.970
So, what happened
to this guy?

15:18.038 --> 15:20.056
He was separated from
his wife about a year ago,

15:20.124 --> 15:22.775
but that's a bit far back
to be a trigger.

15:22.826 --> 15:25.077
Well, he's unstable.

15:25.145 --> 15:27.530
He's on a rampage
of some kind.

15:27.614 --> 15:32.318
What if mentally he was reliving
a combat situation?

15:32.369 --> 15:34.370
It could be
post-traumatic stress.

15:34.455 --> 15:37.039
Everybody could
look like an enemy.

15:37.124 --> 15:39.625
Prentiss, this was
a close-knit family.

15:39.676 --> 15:41.249
Look at them.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.051
They couldn't have been
more proud of their son.

15:43.547 --> 15:45.882
How bad would
his disorder have to be

15:45.966 --> 15:48.017
to make him kill
his own parents?

15:58.729 --> 16:00.645
Post-traumatic
stress disorder rarely

16:00.670 --> 16:03.405
turns people into killers,
but soldiers with PTSD

16:03.406 --> 16:05.209
have been known to strangle
their wives in bed

16:05.210 --> 16:07.845
while having flashbacks or nightmares,
believing they're on the battlefield.

16:07.905 --> 16:11.157
In 2005, an Iraqi war vet
assaulted two people in Las Vegas,

16:11.208 --> 16:13.576
believing them to be
enemy combatants.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.294
So Dolan's having
a sustained flashback.

16:15.362 --> 16:18.080
Pathological disassociation is one
of the markers of complex PTSD,

16:18.165 --> 16:20.750
although Dolan has been
stateside for 6 years.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.919
An escalation of the symptoms
is possible,

16:23.003 --> 16:25.171
but it would be rare for them
to appear out of nowhere.

16:25.222 --> 16:27.510
Well, he seems to have
made a successful transition

16:27.535 --> 16:28.558
to civilian life.

16:28.559 --> 16:30.476
Well, at least on paper it does.
We should find out

16:30.544 --> 16:31.978
if he's had any symptoms
since he left the Navy.

16:32.045 --> 16:33.846
It could have been
the catalyst for the separation.

16:33.897 --> 16:35.715
I'll have Garcia
check his records.

16:35.782 --> 16:37.716
Hotch, Dolan's been
going through this.

16:37.768 --> 16:39.483
Look, old mementos
and journals from

16:39.508 --> 16:40.708
his days in the service.

16:41.104 --> 16:42.751
He didn't come here
just to kill his parents.

16:42.776 --> 16:44.058
He came to get something.

16:44.191 --> 16:46.075
He's on some sort
of mission.

16:49.112 --> 16:51.564
The car's washed,
spotless inside,

16:51.615 --> 16:54.033
there's no paint
separation or rust.

16:54.084 --> 16:55.501
This accident was recent.

16:55.569 --> 16:56.619
I agree.

16:56.703 --> 16:58.571
The Navy's in his blood.

16:58.622 --> 17:01.007
He would never let that go
without getting it fixed immediately.

17:01.074 --> 17:03.009
It might have triggered
his condition.

17:03.076 --> 17:06.127
I'll have Garcia run the plates,
check for any recent accidents.

17:06.213 --> 17:08.914
So, Dolan left his sedan and
didn't take the parents' car.

17:08.965 --> 17:10.749
He was smart enough to know
it'd be tracked.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.685
He's either on foot
or he's stolen another vehicle.

17:12.752 --> 17:15.421
If he's capable of doing this,
he's rational and clear-thinking enough

17:15.472 --> 17:16.888
to evade
his perceived enemies.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.025
So despite any
mental incapacity,

17:19.092 --> 17:21.426
he's still performing
at a high level.

17:21.478 --> 17:24.146
Just got word the local P.D.'s
at the wife and daughter's house.

17:24.231 --> 17:25.698
Dolan's unpredictable
when he's on a rampage.

17:25.765 --> 17:26.821
We need to go wide.

17:26.847 --> 17:27.900
We need to get
the profile to the press.

17:27.901 --> 17:30.102
Luke Dolan
is a Navy veteran

17:30.153 --> 17:32.938
we believe is suffering
from PTSD.

17:32.990 --> 17:35.041
A recent trauma
may have triggered this.

17:35.108 --> 17:38.494
He is experiencing
pathological disassociation

17:38.579 --> 17:40.880
and may believe he's in
a combat situation.

17:40.947 --> 17:42.298
What this means is,
to him,

17:42.382 --> 17:44.550
everyone is a potential enemy.

17:44.618 --> 17:46.085
Do not underestimate him.

17:46.136 --> 17:49.388
Despite his mental state,
he has extreme survival skills.

17:49.456 --> 17:51.642
Right now, we believe
he's within a 250-mile

17:51.667 --> 17:52.725
radius of Roanoke.

17:52.726 --> 17:55.711
He is armed
and extremely dangerous.

17:55.779 --> 17:59.231
It is important that you do not
approach this man.

17:59.299 --> 18:01.183
He believes
that he is on a mission,

18:01.268 --> 18:03.569
and if threatened,
he will kill.

18:03.637 --> 18:05.738
So if you see him,
stay away

18:05.805 --> 18:08.491
and notify the authorities.

18:46.196 --> 18:48.648
Sir. Sir!

18:48.715 --> 18:50.316
All units,
suspect is a Navy veteran...

18:50.367 --> 18:52.485
Sir, excuse me. Sir, I need you
to stop right there.

18:52.536 --> 18:54.236
14, what's your status?

18:54.321 --> 18:56.072
This is 14, shutting
down Linley Road now.

18:56.156 --> 18:59.024
Sir, this road's closed.
You'll have to turn around.

18:59.076 --> 19:00.209
What's going on, officer?

19:00.293 --> 19:01.794
Official police matter, sir.

19:11.221 --> 19:13.255
One thing that's
been bothering me

19:13.340 --> 19:15.124
is the first victim,
Adam Werner,

19:15.192 --> 19:18.144
was given the Navy Cross
in 2000.

19:18.211 --> 19:19.345
We weren't at war.

19:19.396 --> 19:20.763
Exactly.

19:20.847 --> 19:22.648
You have to show
extreme sacrifice,

19:22.716 --> 19:25.685
risk life and limb to win the
second-highest medal of valor.

19:25.736 --> 19:29.021
So what did he do during
peacetime to deserve it?

19:29.072 --> 19:31.732
So, Garcia discovered
part of Dolan's military

19:31.757 --> 19:32.692
records were encrypted.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.244
I just go the complete file
from the Pentagon.

19:35.328 --> 19:37.079
He wasn't a clerk.
He was a Navy Seal.

19:37.164 --> 19:38.614
Let me guess.
Adam Werner was, too.

19:38.682 --> 19:41.283
Yeah. Werner was the seal team
leader, Dolan was his number 2.

19:41.368 --> 19:43.869
Their unit was part of JSOC.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.405
They were involved in over 20
highly classified missions.

19:46.456 --> 19:48.124
Which missions
were in 2000?

19:48.208 --> 19:49.592
Uh, only one.

19:49.676 --> 19:51.961
Operation Dorado Falls.

19:52.045 --> 19:53.429
See what you can
find out about it.

19:53.513 --> 19:54.430
Will do.

19:54.514 --> 19:55.848
- That changes the profile.
- Definitely.

19:55.915 --> 19:57.683
How so?

19:57.751 --> 20:01.187
Navy Seals are screened
carefully for vulnerability to PTSD.

20:01.254 --> 20:02.588
They're resistant to it.

20:02.639 --> 20:05.441
So why would a trained
Navy Seal kill his commanding officer

20:05.525 --> 20:07.193
and his own parents?

20:07.260 --> 20:08.561
I don't know, but it's gonna be
a lot harder to find him.

20:08.612 --> 20:11.230
Very few people on this planet
are capable of stopping him.

20:11.281 --> 20:14.200
Luke Dolan just evaded
a roadblock near his wife's house.

20:14.267 --> 20:17.269
They searched the surrounding
area. There's no sign of him.

20:23.326 --> 20:28.447
Did you notice any recent
changes in Luke's behavior?

20:28.498 --> 20:31.301
I saw him Friday afternoon
when he dropped Ally off.

20:31.326 --> 20:32.526
He was fine.

20:32.586 --> 20:35.337
Did he ever mention
Dorado Falls?

20:35.422 --> 20:36.922
No. What is that?

20:36.973 --> 20:39.258
A mission he was on.

20:39.326 --> 20:41.761
He didn't share that part
of his life with me.

20:41.812 --> 20:46.449
Luke was always very good
at compartmentalizing.

20:46.516 --> 20:48.517
Is that why
you two separated?

20:48.602 --> 20:51.437
He's a good man
and a wonderful father,

20:51.488 --> 20:53.358
but I always felt
he was more married

20:53.383 --> 20:54.473
to the Navy than me.

20:54.474 --> 20:56.992
You weren't
a priority to him?

20:57.077 --> 21:01.113
Somebody once told me
all Navy Seals had a bolt hole,

21:01.164 --> 21:03.115
a secret location
outside the country

21:03.166 --> 21:06.452
where they had another identity
and bank account set up.

21:06.503 --> 21:10.289
And I asked Luke about it once
and he didn't deny it.

21:10.340 --> 21:12.862
The fact of the matter is,
he was ready to leave

21:12.887 --> 21:14.087
in an instant.

21:14.261 --> 21:17.296
He had an exit strategy.

21:17.347 --> 21:20.683
Yeah. That didn't include us.

21:21.968 --> 21:25.104
Is daddy gonna be ok?

21:25.171 --> 21:27.005
Oh, honey, come here.

21:29.509 --> 21:32.561
Ok, so it turns out
6:20 Friday night

21:32.646 --> 21:35.114
Dolan got in a car accident
in Bethesda.

21:35.181 --> 21:36.732
That must have been after
he dropped off his daughter.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.819
He suffered minor injuries,
he refused medical treatment.

21:39.870 --> 21:41.186
Well, his wife said he was fine
when he left her.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.856
What was his mental state
after the accident?

21:43.907 --> 21:45.407
Normal. Field sobriety test
came up negative.

21:45.492 --> 21:46.909
That wouldn't
rule out drug use.

21:46.993 --> 21:48.327
I'd consider schizophrenia,

21:48.378 --> 21:51.163
except he's the wrong age
for the first psychotic break.

21:51.214 --> 21:52.915
It could be an aneurysm
or a brain tumor.

21:52.999 --> 21:55.301
Well, one thing's for sure.
He's having a mental breakdown,

21:55.368 --> 21:57.086
but what are the
specific features of it?

21:57.170 --> 21:59.255
He's not living in a past time
and place, he's living in the present,

21:59.339 --> 22:02.675
with the capacity and intelligence
to evade law enforcement.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.701
Honey, grab me a soda, will you?

22:28.752 --> 22:31.871
Honey, the movie's starting.
You're missing Robert Mitchum.

22:34.824 --> 22:37.543
You want her to live?
Tell me where my family is.

22:43.799 --> 22:45.054
He took my husband.

22:45.079 --> 22:46.951
Boyd was bleeding
and he dragged him out.

22:46.952 --> 22:48.753
- Mrs. Milgram--
- Is someone from the army helping?

22:48.804 --> 22:50.834
Ma'am, listen to me.
The FBI is in charge

22:50.859 --> 22:52.412
of looking for your husband,
but I need you

22:52.413 --> 22:54.378
to try to remember
what Luke Dolan said.

22:54.643 --> 22:56.227
I can't. It was gibberish.

22:56.295 --> 22:58.563
Yes, you can.
Just close your eyes.

22:58.630 --> 22:59.964
Ma'am, I believe
that you can.

23:00.015 --> 23:01.783
Just listen to the sound of
my voice and you'll be fine.

23:01.851 --> 23:04.068
Just try.
Close your eyes.

23:04.136 --> 23:05.469
There you go.

23:05.521 --> 23:07.638
Just relax and breathe.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.140
Very good.

23:09.191 --> 23:11.576
Now, what were you doing

23:11.643 --> 23:13.978
before he broke into
your house?

23:14.029 --> 23:16.422
I was in the kitchen.

23:16.447 --> 23:18.346
I was pouring a drink
for my husband.

23:19.535 --> 23:23.338
He takes me to the living
room and ties me up.

23:23.422 --> 23:24.989
What does he say?

23:25.040 --> 23:26.157
Where are my real parents?

23:26.208 --> 23:27.992
He asks where
his real parents are.

23:28.043 --> 23:29.827
How the hell should I know?
I don't even know you.

23:29.879 --> 23:32.347
Don't play dumb.
You replaced them.

23:32.431 --> 23:34.599
Does he think your husband
did something to them?

23:34.666 --> 23:37.101
He says,
"you replaced them."

23:37.169 --> 23:38.887
Luke and Mrs.
The replacements are dead.

23:38.971 --> 23:41.055
Does he mention
Dorado Falls?

23:41.140 --> 23:42.273
Yes.

23:42.341 --> 23:44.108
This is about Dorado Falls,
isn't it?

23:44.176 --> 23:46.227
And gaslighting.

23:46.312 --> 23:47.478
Dorado Falls?

23:47.529 --> 23:49.447
You're gaslighting me
'cause of the mission.

23:49.514 --> 23:52.283
The mission? Who's your
commanding officer?

23:52.351 --> 23:54.068
You won't get away
with this.

23:54.153 --> 23:57.071
Where are you keeping
Jenna and Ally?

23:57.156 --> 23:59.073
Where's my family?

23:59.158 --> 24:02.210
He was calm until
he asked about his family.

24:02.294 --> 24:06.464
Then he hits Boyd
with the gun.

24:09.501 --> 24:11.753
All of the Milgrams'
cars are still here,

24:11.837 --> 24:14.589
so he must have taken the General
in whatever vehicle he came in.

24:14.673 --> 24:16.140
He talked about gaslighting.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.509
He thinks someone's trying to
purposely distort his reality.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.095
He said his parents
had been replaced.

24:21.180 --> 24:22.480
He just sounds
delusional.

24:23.882 --> 24:26.851
You know, he might have
Capgras syndrome.

24:26.902 --> 24:28.727
It's a delusional disorder
in which one believes that

24:28.728 --> 24:29.630
their friends and loved ones

24:29.655 --> 24:30.772
have been replaced
by imposters.

24:30.856 --> 24:32.690
Sort of like "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers."

24:32.741 --> 24:35.410
It typically involves
only one sense, such as sight.

24:35.494 --> 24:37.578
Basically, the neural connection
between the visual cortex

24:37.663 --> 24:39.414
and the emotional center
of the brain becomes severed,

24:39.498 --> 24:41.332
so that looking at a loved one
doesn't elicit

24:41.400 --> 24:42.700
the same emotional response
one would expect.

24:42.751 --> 24:44.502
So you think
they're an imposter.

24:44.569 --> 24:46.173
And the interesting thing is

24:46.198 --> 24:47.738
that the auditory connection
remains intact,

24:47.739 --> 24:50.074
so that if they were to hear
a loved one speak and not see them,

24:50.125 --> 24:51.259
they'd think
that they were real.

24:51.343 --> 24:52.593
What causes this syndrome?

24:52.678 --> 24:54.512
It's unknown
in 60% of the cases,

24:54.579 --> 24:56.097
but the rest have
an organic cause,

24:56.181 --> 24:57.632
such as tumor or head trauma.

24:57.716 --> 24:59.183
He was in a car accident
Friday.

24:59.251 --> 25:00.685
People with
delusional disorders

25:00.752 --> 25:02.353
don't all become
killers, though.

25:02.421 --> 25:04.088
True, but Dolan's background
as a Navy Seal,

25:04.139 --> 25:06.590
his knowledge of secret
missions, plus Capgras syndrome,

25:06.642 --> 25:09.427
could result in extreme paranoia.
It's the perfect storm.

25:09.478 --> 25:11.762
Is there
a cure for this?

25:11.814 --> 25:14.282
Unfortunately, no. Although
medications have helped in a few cases.

25:14.366 --> 25:16.767
So this guy's stuck with it.
He's not killing for the thrill of it,

25:16.819 --> 25:18.786
he does it because he believes
he has no other choice.

25:18.871 --> 25:21.272
He murdered his best friend
and his parents

25:21.340 --> 25:23.374
because he believed
they were imposters.

25:23.442 --> 25:25.159
So if he were to see
his wife and daughter,

25:25.244 --> 25:26.577
the results
would be deadly.

25:26.628 --> 25:28.546
Dolan kidnapped the General
and didn't kill his wife

25:28.613 --> 25:30.748
because he had never
met them before.

25:30.799 --> 25:32.583
There might be
another reason.

25:32.634 --> 25:34.552
He wants contact.

25:34.619 --> 25:37.088
I don't know what you think
you're gonna gain by your actions,

25:37.139 --> 25:38.427
but I do know this--

25:38.452 --> 25:40.577
you swore an oath
to defend this country

25:40.625 --> 25:42.226
and behave
with moral rectitude.

25:42.294 --> 25:44.477
Were you thinking of morals
when you gave the go-ahead

25:44.502 --> 25:45.596
on Dorado Falls?

25:45.597 --> 25:46.931
I told you,
that wasn't me.

25:46.982 --> 25:48.433
You're a liar.

25:48.484 --> 25:49.984
This country's at war,
and Dorado Falls

25:50.069 --> 25:51.986
is nothing but
a speck on the radar.

25:52.071 --> 25:53.488
No one even remembers.

25:53.572 --> 25:55.306
I remember.

25:58.977 --> 26:00.995
What are you
gonna do with me?

26:01.080 --> 26:03.614
I'll trade you
for my wife and child.

26:03.665 --> 26:05.366
And if that doesn't work?

26:05.451 --> 26:07.952
I'll kill you.

26:08.003 --> 26:11.339
You're not a Navy Seal,
you're a disgrace--

26:14.710 --> 26:16.627
how close are you
to getting Dolan?

26:16.678 --> 26:21.299
Our primary goal right now is the
safe recovery of the General.

26:21.350 --> 26:25.136
This is highly classified
information, Agent Jareau.

26:25.187 --> 26:27.939
Can't the BAU
do this on their own?

26:28.006 --> 26:31.392
We could. But your help
would speed things up.

26:31.477 --> 26:36.397
You're smart enough
to see the upside, I'm sure.

26:36.465 --> 26:39.233
You help and it goes well,
you get your ticket punched.

26:39.301 --> 26:41.781
You don't and it goes south,
well, the weather's not

26:41.806 --> 26:43.006
too bad outside the beltway.

26:51.863 --> 26:53.197
It's all in there.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.469
You know why Dolan's
so worried about this mission?

26:58.537 --> 26:59.804
I have no idea.

26:59.871 --> 27:01.973
Were there complications?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.825
Every mission
has complications.

27:03.892 --> 27:06.477
But there's no blowback on this
one, I can assure you of that.

27:06.545 --> 27:08.379
Ok.

27:11.350 --> 27:14.500
It just--I can't understand
why Luke would do

27:14.525 --> 27:15.725
all these awful things.

27:16.238 --> 27:17.438
What's happening to him?

27:17.523 --> 27:19.273
We think his car accident

27:19.358 --> 27:21.909
triggered
a delusional disorder.

27:21.994 --> 27:24.112
Oh, my God.

27:24.196 --> 27:27.081
We need to know
who Luke was closest to.

27:27.166 --> 27:28.533
His father.

27:59.314 --> 28:00.531
Hello.

28:00.599 --> 28:02.867
Is this
Lieutenant Luke Dolan?

28:02.934 --> 28:04.435
Who is this?

28:04.486 --> 28:06.204
Sergeant Major David Rossi,

28:06.271 --> 28:08.873
United States Marine Corps,
retired.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.324
Who told you
to call me?

28:11.493 --> 28:13.944
I volunteered to call you.

28:13.996 --> 28:16.664
I knew your dad, Mark.

28:16.748 --> 28:18.782
We were in boot camp
together at Parris Island.

28:18.834 --> 28:19.950
He's a good man.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.036
Still triangulating
a location. Hold on.

28:22.104 --> 28:23.787
Hold on.
Now, we can talk,

28:23.839 --> 28:26.957
but first I need to know
that General Milgram is safe.

28:28.460 --> 28:31.062
He's alive,
if that's what you mean.

28:31.129 --> 28:32.897
What's up
with the music?

28:32.964 --> 28:34.065
I have no idea.

28:34.132 --> 28:35.566
Why did you kidnap
the General?

28:35.634 --> 28:37.518
For leverage
to get my family back.

28:37.603 --> 28:39.520
Do you think
we're holding them?

28:39.605 --> 28:41.405
I saw you take
my wife and child.

28:41.473 --> 28:42.640
What have you got,
Garcia?

28:42.691 --> 28:43.774
Getting closer.

28:43.825 --> 28:45.743
We're in the warehouse
district. Stand by.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.495
Please, stand by.

28:49.248 --> 28:51.199
Got it! 3352 Spring Street.

28:51.283 --> 28:53.117
Let's go.

28:53.168 --> 28:56.337
Release the General and then
we can talk about your family.

28:56.421 --> 28:57.588
He's innocent.

28:57.656 --> 28:59.207
So you think.

28:59.291 --> 29:01.876
Luke, do you think your
father would approve

29:01.960 --> 29:03.211
of what you're doing?

29:03.295 --> 29:06.597
I just want my family back.

29:06.665 --> 29:08.432
Besides, I didn't start this.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.767
Start what?

29:09.834 --> 29:11.102
Dorado Falls.

29:11.169 --> 29:14.105
Why don't you tell us
your side of the story?

29:14.172 --> 29:16.023
You first.

29:16.108 --> 29:18.142
All right.

29:19.844 --> 29:23.648
Dorado Falls was the name of a boat
off the coast of Cape Town.

29:23.699 --> 29:26.517
It was owned by
a South African diplomat

29:26.568 --> 29:29.019
who was selling
nuclear secrets to Iran.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.354
So what's
the big secret?

29:30.405 --> 29:32.156
There isn't one.
Don't get me wrong,

29:32.207 --> 29:34.458
lives were lost, but there's been
far worse missions.

29:34.526 --> 29:38.246
His mind chose Dorado Falls
to build a conspiracy around.

29:47.539 --> 29:48.806
This can't be it.

29:48.873 --> 29:51.425
Garcia, it's an empty lot
with a cell phone repeater.

29:51.510 --> 29:52.810
Give me a rundown
on the buildings in the area

29:52.877 --> 29:54.312
and the years
that they were built.

29:54.379 --> 29:56.213
All over it like
cat hair on a sofa.

29:56.265 --> 29:59.267
Btw, I can usually locate
a cell phone within 3 meters,

29:59.351 --> 30:01.602
but sometimes there are
circumstances beyond my control,

30:01.687 --> 30:03.888
like physical barriers
blocking a signal,

30:03.956 --> 30:05.389
not being in the satellite's
direct line of sight,

30:05.440 --> 30:06.824
which bounces the signal
to a repeater.

30:06.891 --> 30:08.192
Garcia, tell me
you've got something.

30:08.243 --> 30:09.610
Oh, sorry.
Yes, I have something.

30:09.695 --> 30:14.532
There is a hotel built in '74
that is scheduled for demo,

30:14.583 --> 30:16.673
and there is a warehouse
scheduled for loft conversion

30:16.698 --> 30:17.535
that was built in 1928.

30:17.536 --> 30:19.370
All right, walls were
thicker in the twenties.

30:19.421 --> 30:20.671
What's the address
of the building?

30:20.739 --> 30:23.624
More GPS signal interference.
Exact address is...

30:23.709 --> 30:24.842
291 Hope Street.

30:24.909 --> 30:26.794
291 Hope.

30:26.878 --> 30:32.383
Intel failed to identify...
Two children aboard the boat.

30:32.434 --> 30:35.936
There was a chance to abort,

30:36.021 --> 30:38.439
but we were given orders
to go ahead.

30:38.523 --> 30:41.108
Someone in the D.I.A.
made that final call.

30:41.193 --> 30:44.111
I never knew
it was Milgram until now.

30:44.196 --> 30:46.947
Sometimes collateral
damage can't be avoided.

30:47.032 --> 30:50.768
You know, people that sit
in offices always think that.

30:53.938 --> 30:56.407
This is Red Echo.
We have unwanted targets.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.292
Permission to abort.

30:58.377 --> 31:00.661
Negative, Red Echo.
The operation is a go.

31:00.746 --> 31:04.448
I repeat, the operation
is a go.

31:05.784 --> 31:08.135
You had to shoot
those kids, didn't you?

31:08.220 --> 31:10.588
They saw us. They would
have blown the mission.

31:10.639 --> 31:12.807
They were witnesses.

31:12.891 --> 31:15.593
Just like everyone
at Synalock.

31:27.656 --> 31:28.939
Someone wants revenge.

31:28.990 --> 31:31.242
We've always known
that our own government

31:31.309 --> 31:33.194
might disavow us.

31:33.278 --> 31:35.946
They tried to buy Adam with the
Navy Cross, but it didn't work,

31:35.997 --> 31:38.582
so they've replaced him
with an imposter.

31:38.650 --> 31:41.085
And now they're taking
my family one by one.

31:41.152 --> 31:44.121
Listen, Jenna
and Ally are safe.

31:44.172 --> 31:46.156
You expect me to believe that?

31:46.208 --> 31:49.377
I know they're
coming after me.

31:49.461 --> 31:51.679
I'll make you an offer.

31:51.763 --> 31:54.682
You let Milgram go
and I'll take his place.

31:54.766 --> 31:56.467
I don't want you,
I want my family.

31:56.518 --> 31:59.550
The people who have them
will not negotiate

31:59.575 --> 32:00.775
unless Milgram is freed.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.358
But you need insurance.
I get that.

32:04.443 --> 32:05.943
Let me take his place.

32:06.010 --> 32:07.144
Why would you
do that?

32:07.195 --> 32:09.280
Because I'm not just a guy
behind a desk.

32:09.347 --> 32:11.649
I was a marine with boots on
the ground, just like you.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.651
I know what you've been through.

32:13.702 --> 32:17.071
I want you to get
your family back.

32:17.155 --> 32:18.656
All right.

32:19.658 --> 32:20.875
Where's Hotch and Morgan?

32:20.959 --> 32:22.326
The Spring Street
address didn't pan out.

32:22.377 --> 32:23.661
They're searching
the warehouse right now.

32:23.712 --> 32:26.580
Luke, I need
your exact address.

32:30.669 --> 32:32.169
All clear.
Clear.

32:35.724 --> 32:39.009
We got the General.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.060
He's still alive.

32:40.145 --> 32:42.430
Guys, get him out of here.

32:42.514 --> 32:44.482
Now, where the hell is Dolan?

32:44.549 --> 32:47.151
Yeah, he used the radio the mask
the sound of his movements.

32:47.218 --> 32:48.853
We're on the move.

33:17.215 --> 33:18.516
This was all
part of his plan

33:18.583 --> 33:20.468
to find out who was holding
his wife and daughter.

33:20.552 --> 33:22.470
But you never said
you were FBI.

33:22.554 --> 33:23.921
He saw the number
I called from.

33:23.972 --> 33:25.890
He'd recognize an FBI prefix.

33:25.941 --> 33:28.592
So, what, he's on his way
here to Quantico?

33:28.643 --> 33:30.093
I know the head space
he's in.

33:30.145 --> 33:31.595
He feels all alone
right now.

33:31.646 --> 33:33.597
There is no risk
he won't take.

33:33.648 --> 33:35.491
As a Navy seal,
he did training here.

33:35.516 --> 33:36.716
He knows this place.

33:36.785 --> 33:38.319
All right, alert the guard
gates and secure the building.

33:38.403 --> 33:40.204
Entry and exit
through one door only.

33:40.271 --> 33:42.656
An FBI police officer
was just found shot to death

33:42.741 --> 33:44.708
in the academy
parking structure.

33:44.776 --> 33:46.944
He's already here.

33:55.697 --> 33:58.235
Dolan's photo's already been
sent on all internal servers.

33:58.689 --> 34:00.472
He's probably changed
his appearance already.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.107
And he's got
13 floors to hide on.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.675
We should make a General
P.A. announcement.

34:03.743 --> 34:06.444
No. He believes he's on a rescue
mission that he can pull off.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.780
As long as he thinks that,
he'll stay calm.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.114
I've got hundreds
of employees in here

34:10.181 --> 34:11.733
and you want me to do nothing?
Nothing overt.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.902
Have your teams quietly
search and seal off each floor.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.654
Garcia, I need you on the
building's operations computer.

34:15.705 --> 34:16.955
Ready and able, sir.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.456
Dolan's got a police radio.

34:18.524 --> 34:21.859
I want all alerts sent through
a secure tactical channel.

34:21.911 --> 34:23.527
I can talk to him.
He won't hurt me.

34:23.579 --> 34:25.330
We can't take that risk.

34:25.380 --> 34:27.197
You'll be safe in here.

34:47.052 --> 34:47.985
I don't see him.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.221
He knows how to be invisible.

34:52.074 --> 34:54.574
I got him. He used
the dead officer's I.D.

34:54.600 --> 34:55.577
to enter the 7th floor.

34:55.578 --> 34:56.893
Seal it off.
Nobody in or out.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.505
Navy Seals never start a mission
without an exfiltration plan.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.425
Check the exterior and
elevator shafts for riggings.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.445
Turning exterior cameras now.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.464
A member of the seal team said
Dolan's an expert in explosives,

35:16.549 --> 35:18.550
disabling and building them.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.218
Also be on the lookout
for explosives.

35:30.363 --> 35:31.780
Hello?

35:31.864 --> 35:34.199
Is this Sergeant Major Rossi?

35:34.266 --> 35:36.484
Yes. I was hoping
you'd call, Luke.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.619
Where are you?

35:37.703 --> 35:39.237
Right behind you.

35:39.288 --> 35:42.290
Ok, ok. Easy, easy.

35:42.375 --> 35:44.776
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

35:44.827 --> 35:46.944
All right. Luke,

35:46.996 --> 35:49.330
you don't want to be
aiming that around.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.949
Snipers have
the building covered.

35:52.001 --> 35:54.636
You're in the crosshairs
right now, I can guarantee that.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.138
Windows are bulletproof.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.290
High-density Lexan, right?

35:59.341 --> 36:01.810
I'm the one you want.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.261
You can let my team go.

36:03.312 --> 36:07.682
I'll trade you. Give me
my wife and daughter.

36:07.767 --> 36:09.684
You have 3 minutes
to decide.

36:09.769 --> 36:11.853
Is he for real? He'll blow us
all up, himself included?

36:11.937 --> 36:12.854
Start an evacuation.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.739
Can we evacuate everyone
in 3 minutes?

36:14.807 --> 36:17.809
Prentiss, I need
his wife in here.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.811
No one is seeking
revenge here.

36:19.862 --> 36:23.364
You've created this conspiracy
in your own mind.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.949
You took my family.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.703
To protect them from you after
you murdered your own parents.

36:28.788 --> 36:30.655
They were imposters.
You have my real parents.

36:30.706 --> 36:32.156
Your real parents are dead.

36:32.208 --> 36:33.291
Spence--

36:33.342 --> 36:35.460
you want to know
what's really going on?

36:35.511 --> 36:38.379
You were in a car accident
3 nights ago

36:38.464 --> 36:40.048
and you suffered a head trauma.

36:40.132 --> 36:44.769
If I don't see Jenna
and Ally now...

36:44.837 --> 36:46.638
We're all gonna die.

36:46.689 --> 36:49.607
Luke?

36:49.675 --> 36:52.310
Can you hear me?

36:52.361 --> 36:54.979
I need you to stop
what you're doing.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.236
We're fine.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.956
Me and Ally
are safe.

37:05.023 --> 37:09.160
Luke, you have to let
those people go.

37:10.830 --> 37:12.247
The terms haven't changed.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.748
You don't
believe that's her?

37:13.833 --> 37:15.750
I've been through this
before.

37:15.835 --> 37:17.585
You have one minute.

37:17.670 --> 37:22.373
Daddy? Why are you doing this?

37:22.424 --> 37:24.542
Mommy says you don't feel good.

37:24.593 --> 37:26.761
Maybe you need to lie down.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.715
I'm scared, daddy.

37:30.766 --> 37:33.551
I just want to go home.

37:42.111 --> 37:44.729
Jenna, can you talk to him
about something personal,

37:44.780 --> 37:47.615
something that only the two
of you would know about?

37:56.909 --> 38:00.295
Do you remember our honeymoon,

38:00.379 --> 38:03.464
when you woke me up at night

38:03.549 --> 38:05.350
and you took me up that mountain

38:05.417 --> 38:07.302
that you'd hiked years before?

38:07.386 --> 38:10.688
We watched the sun rise.

38:10.756 --> 38:14.258
It was magical.

38:14.310 --> 38:16.594
And you said

38:16.645 --> 38:19.614
that as much as you loved
this spot,

38:19.698 --> 38:23.785
you loved me even more.

38:25.154 --> 38:27.772
Do you believe
it's her now?

38:27.823 --> 38:30.291
Your eyes and your mind
are playing a trick on you.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.944
When you see your family,
you think that they're imposters,

38:32.995 --> 38:35.580
but it's all caused
by an illness.

38:35.631 --> 38:38.550
You're sick, Luke.
It's not your fault.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.951
I love you, daddy.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.104
We both do.

38:43.172 --> 38:44.872
Come on, now, Luke,

38:44.940 --> 38:47.842
you don't need that gun.

38:47.927 --> 38:50.678
None of us want to hurt you.
You are a hero to this country.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.297
Please let us help you.

38:53.349 --> 38:54.732
I want to see Jenna.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.235
Then you have to do
as I ask.

38:57.302 --> 38:58.970
Put your weapon down

38:59.021 --> 39:01.305
and close your eyes.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.211
Luke, you have to
close your eyes.

39:23.295 --> 39:24.328
Why?

39:24.380 --> 39:25.830
Because you need to know
that your wife is real

39:25.881 --> 39:27.632
and your eyes will trick you.

39:27.683 --> 39:30.551
Please, Luke.

39:30.636 --> 39:34.022
Close your eyes or we will
never be together again.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.346
Close your eyes.

39:42.398 --> 39:44.849
Ok. They're afraid
you might hurt me,

39:44.900 --> 39:47.351
so they're gonna handcuff you.

39:47.403 --> 39:49.186
And then I'm going to come out,

39:49.238 --> 39:52.573
but you have to keep
your eyes closed.

40:01.250 --> 40:02.533
I'm right here, baby.

40:02.584 --> 40:05.219
Promise me you'll keep
your eyes closed.

40:07.756 --> 40:10.308
Is that you?

40:10.375 --> 40:12.760
Is that really you?

40:12.828 --> 40:14.562
Everything's
gonna be ok.

40:14.647 --> 40:17.482
But we have to go
to the hospital now, ok?

40:17.549 --> 40:19.884
First Jenna's gonna
cover up your eyes.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.522
Daddy! Daddy,
where are you going?

40:24.573 --> 40:26.691
No! No! JJ, let me have him.

40:26.742 --> 40:27.725
Daddy!

40:27.776 --> 40:29.727
Get him out of here!
No! No!

40:29.778 --> 40:31.512
Get him out of here!
No!

40:31.580 --> 40:32.947
No!

40:44.576 --> 40:47.128
"We're born alone,
we live alone,

40:47.212 --> 40:48.680
"we die alone.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.748
"Only through our love
and friendship

40:50.799 --> 40:53.351
"can we create the illusion
for a moment

40:53.418 --> 40:55.186
that we're not alone."

40:55.253 --> 40:57.522
Orson Welles.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.424
No, I didn't mandate it.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.359
Uh, is everything
all right? You ok?

41:01.426 --> 41:03.361
Oh, yeah. I'm good.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.546
It's all in a day's work,
right?

41:05.614 --> 41:07.198
I'll see you in the morning.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.416
Good night.

41:10.202 --> 41:12.453
Hey.

41:12.538 --> 41:16.324
Uh, Hotch didn't order
my takedown recertification.

41:16.408 --> 41:18.292
Do you want to tell me
what's really going on?

41:18.377 --> 41:20.945
I just thought we both
could use a refresher.

41:20.996 --> 41:22.830
You mean you thought
I could use it.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.449
You're nervous
about me being back.

41:25.501 --> 41:27.135
Emily...

41:27.219 --> 41:29.787
What...you think I'm gonna
mess up the team's rhythm.

41:29.838 --> 41:32.456
I get it. But just
come out and say it.

41:32.508 --> 41:33.457
Morgan.

41:33.509 --> 41:34.642
Ok, fine.

41:34.727 --> 41:36.594
Yes, I am nervous.

41:36.645 --> 41:39.097
But not about you.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.848
About me.

41:40.933 --> 41:43.267
Emily, I thought
I lost you,

41:43.318 --> 41:45.319
and I blamed myself.

41:45.404 --> 41:47.155
Now, you're back, but I
don't want to be worried

41:47.239 --> 41:50.474
about losing you again
and get distracted.

41:50.526 --> 41:53.411
So you wanted
some reassurance.

41:53.478 --> 41:56.664
Yeah, something like that.

41:56.749 --> 42:00.151
Morgan, I cannot imagine
what you went through.

42:00.202 --> 42:02.420
It was 7 months of hell.

42:02.487 --> 42:05.089
How can I make it up
to you?

42:05.157 --> 42:07.324
I will do whatever it takes.

42:07.376 --> 42:09.677
Just give me 10 hours
of training.

42:09.762 --> 42:10.678
Ok, you got it.

42:10.763 --> 42:12.630
Shooting range on Sundays.

42:12.681 --> 42:15.133
I'm there.

42:15.184 --> 42:17.268
And my morning coffee

42:17.335 --> 42:18.803
and a neck rub every day.

42:18.854 --> 42:21.973
Oh, buddy,
you are really pushing it.
