00:41.342 --> 00:45.189
I mean, it's sad that
not a day goes by

00:45.213 --> 00:47.257
where we don't stand
in front of a mirror

00:47.281 --> 00:51.628
and pass judgment on
our own self-image,

00:51.652 --> 00:54.564
constantly analyzing
our own reflection,

00:54.588 --> 00:59.136
desperately wanting
to change who we are.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.637
You know it starts
when you're young,

01:00.661 --> 01:03.373
and you get influenced,
and that influence,

01:03.397 --> 01:06.276
it sticks with you
your entire life.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.246
What the hell is he doing
over there all by himself?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.547
Why doesn't he join
the other kids?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.149
What the hell's he doing?

01:12.173 --> 01:13.850
The Jersey's way too big on him.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.819
Adam, honey, people are
waiting behind you.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.688
Just put your feet on the...
Don't stand on the ledge.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.290
Just concentrate
for two seconds.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.492
No, just... come on!

01:22.516 --> 01:23.593
Jesus Christ.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.896
My parents were strict.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.300
I had no confidence growing up.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.203
I never even had a girlfriend
or went to a school dance

01:33.227 --> 01:37.674
or even held a girl's hand
because I was too insecure.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.610
You know, all that stuff
matters when you're a kid.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.204
- Show me how happy you are...
How happy you are...

01:47.808 --> 01:51.755
Society tells us to be happy,

01:51.779 --> 01:54.624
love ourselves,

01:54.648 --> 01:58.362
but then hands us a
million reasons not to.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.197
You're too fat.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.466
You're too skinny or too ugly.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.234
Too broke.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.403
Your teeth aren't white enough.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.937
You don't have the right car,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.606
the right house.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.441
Your dick's too small,

02:11.465 --> 02:15.245
and your head's too big.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.548
I wish I could just take
a break from it all.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.685
The comparison to others, wishing
I could be someone else,

02:21.709 --> 02:26.190
instead of accepting
what I already have,

02:26.214 --> 02:29.726
like this unfinished house.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.730
I've got a fiancÃ©e who's
way too good for me.

02:33.754 --> 02:38.568
I just feel like I'm
in over my head.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.795
I'm not happy with the way
I look, or the way I feel.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.842
I can't even relate
to the person

02:45.866 --> 02:47.677
I'm staring at anymore,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.646
and everywhere I go, there I am,

02:49.670 --> 02:52.673
standing in my own fucking way.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.377
Something's gotta change.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.694
Thank you for your time,
I really appreciate it.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.671
It just got to a point where I was
putting vodka in my cheerios.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.574
Mr. Stenson.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.642
Did you get my note?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.678
Yes, sir, I sure did.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.646
So you remembered to
clock in this morning?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.748
Yes, sir, I sure did.

03:58.772 --> 04:02.652
Good, good, well, let's... let's
hope you've learned your lesson.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.789
Yes, sir. I sure did.

04:05.813 --> 04:09.293
"Yes, sir, i... I sure did."

04:09.317 --> 04:11.752
That's it? That's all you
got to bring to the party?

04:13.521 --> 04:17.367
Let me tell you something.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.737
This is a phone
job, not a fun job,

04:20.761 --> 04:24.508
which means you have to do
some dialing and talking

04:24.532 --> 04:26.042
in order to become successful.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.613
You... you do understand
that, don't you?

04:29.637 --> 04:32.582
Okay. Well, that's a big
first step, don't you think?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.718
Let me ask you something.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.387
What is it in the universe

04:37.411 --> 04:39.723
that the more you
take away from it,

04:39.747 --> 04:41.549
the bigger it gets?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.864
A hole.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.599
You keep digging.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.901
Let me know when you want
to start fucking dialing.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.561
Okay?

04:58.866 --> 05:01.034
Start fucking dialing.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.790
Heavenly father, we thank
you for this bounty.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.426
We thank you for the food
we are about to partake,

05:16.450 --> 05:19.763
and those who serve it.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.466
We thank you, lord,
for Adam and Sara

05:22.490 --> 05:24.968
to being here with us tonight,

05:24.992 --> 05:30.640
and we ask you to bless them
in their nuptials coming up,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.109
and we ask you to,
maybe, help Adam

05:33.133 --> 05:35.769
actually get his house
done before the wedding.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.749
In your name, amen.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.386
Well, joke's there, you know?

05:42.410 --> 05:45.078
You gotta take it.

06:03.631 --> 06:07.110
This is really good.

06:07.134 --> 06:10.614
Well, thank you, hon,
it is store bought,

06:10.638 --> 06:13.817
'cause I can't cook for
shit, and I never could.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.786
Yeah. Why do you
think I'm so skinny?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.423
Adam.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.891
It's better than being
fat, though, right?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.860
I always told the
boy to eat more.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.497
I said it over and over
again growing up, didn't I?

06:27.521 --> 06:31.134
From the time he was a toddler,
he should have eaten more.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.693
Huh?

06:34.227 --> 06:38.207
Adam, you were just
really picky as a child.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.045
I... I really wasn't
that picky, mom.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.871
Well, I did my best.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.787
We're a picky family.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.614
Might as well kind of know
that coming in, right?

07:03.056 --> 07:06.660
Well, I am, like,
beyond exhausted.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.175
Are you hungry, Adam?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.578
I'm starving. That food...

07:14.602 --> 07:18.939
I mean, I know your mom meant
well, but it was disgusting.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.088
When did you start
drinking whole milk?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.714
It tastes like cream.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.560
Stop.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.520
What's your problem?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.023
Hmm?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.572
Okay, Adam, clearly
something's wrong.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.575
There's nothing...

07:45.599 --> 07:47.210
Okay?

07:47.234 --> 07:51.247
I'm not just gonna sit here
and talk to myself all night,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.550
because that argument
that we had at dinner...

07:53.574 --> 07:55.543
I really don't wanna do it now.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.728
Do you think I would look
better if I put some muscle on?

08:04.752 --> 08:08.297
I don't know, Adam.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.658
I don't know. Anybody
would look better.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.705
-To the gym.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.031
You don't have a gym
membership, Adam.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.168
You do.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.403
You're not gonna be spoiling
yourself with chemicals

09:54.427 --> 09:56.005
that you're not even aware of,

09:56.029 --> 09:58.065
and it's just a lot
better for your body.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.417
What do you want to
do this weekend?

10:08.441 --> 10:11.788
Um, I don't know. What
do you want to do?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.724
We could go

10:14.748 --> 10:16.826
okay. Okay.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.318
I haven't seen a
movie in a while.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.966
Here you go.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.434
Your favorite.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.861
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.033
How was the gym last night?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.345
-It was good.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.038
Good.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.453
Do you wanna talk
about what happened?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.147
No, I mean, maybe we could
talk about it later?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.860
Okay.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.119
I think we should, though.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.736
Do you want me to make
you something else?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.938
I have French toast
if you want it.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.308
No, I'm just not really
hungry, I mean...

11:05.332 --> 11:08.001
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.015
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.307
- Bye, I love you.
- I love you, too.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.904
"Make your own ephedra."

12:07.928 --> 12:10.974
"20 tips for building
bigger muscles."

12:10.998 --> 12:13.400
"Four ways to get

12:17.304 --> 12:19.515

12:19.539 --> 12:21.441

12:23.143 --> 12:26.956
How to get a rock hard
boner in three days.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.792
-Jesus.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.960
You're an asshole.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.196
I get it, dude, you wanna
put on some muscle.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.798
Eat protein.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.066
I've never worked out
a day in my life.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.102
I'm naturally blessed.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.303
- So, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.337
-Yep.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.072
Hey, sir.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.875
Do you know the reason why
neither one of you idiots

12:45.899 --> 12:48.077
ever gets fucking laid?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.279
Because of the way you look.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.816
What exactly is this,
the Danny bonaduce line

12:52.840 --> 12:54.283
at jc penneys?

12:54.307 --> 12:55.952
Cause it's a look,

12:55.976 --> 12:59.088
believe me, it works
for you, my friend.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.158
Now you... what's your
fucking deal here?

13:02.182 --> 13:03.526
What's with the fucking beard?

13:03.550 --> 13:06.429
This is some homage
to Abraham Lincoln?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.331
Abraham Lincoln had a
much longer beard, sir,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.934
so can't really be an homage.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.102
You're an expert on
Lincoln, are you?

13:13.126 --> 13:16.840
Oh, great. I know a little
bit about him myself.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.341
Tell me something,
what's the significance

13:18.365 --> 13:22.411
of Abraham Lincoln's hands
in the Lincoln memorial?

13:22.435 --> 13:25.014
The significance of
his hands, my friend,

13:25.038 --> 13:27.150
are the fact that Daniel French,

13:27.174 --> 13:29.352
the sculptor, did his
homework on Lincoln,

13:29.376 --> 13:31.554
Lincoln was the first president
to acknowledge a need

13:31.578 --> 13:34.590
for federal funding
for the deaf.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.926
So he shaped his hands
in his initials,

13:36.950 --> 13:41.330
in sign language, a.L.,

13:41.354 --> 13:44.300
that, of course, I'm sure you
can find somewhere online.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.569
You just must have
missed that chapter.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.037
- Yeah.
- It's a black Mercedes.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.505
I believe you know
where it's parked.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.176
Last time it had a real
vanilla funky smell to it.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.112
Let's go with something a
little more fruity, shall we?

13:56.136 --> 13:58.314
- You have it.
- Yeah, I got you.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.284
What a fucking psychopath, huh?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.418
All right, I'll be back.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.552
Huh? - Lunch.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.653
- Okay.
- See ya.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.147
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.460
Is that your lunch?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.496
Yeah, I'm not really hungry.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.299
How you gonna get big
if you don't eat?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.201
I don't know. Something
about this place

14:18.225 --> 14:19.903
just ruins my appetite.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.437
Do you want some salad?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.471
No.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.240
My mom made it.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.509
I can't believe you moved
back in with your mom.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.511
I didn't move back
in with my mom.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.004
I'm temporarily staying
there, dickmunch.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.121
Look, if you wanna get shredded,

14:38.145 --> 14:41.590
you gotta eat like a lion.

14:41.614 --> 14:45.428
Lions eat red meat, idiot.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.662
Not all of them.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.222
Yes, all of them.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.427
Well, you look real good, bro.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.496
Yeah, man, I got the
nationals coming up.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.731
How many weeks up?
12 weeks, maybe.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.168
12 weeks. I gotta get ready.
It's time to step it up.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.137
- I got you. What
you looking to get?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.673
-The usual man, you tell me.
-All right, well, shit, man.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.575
You can dry out. Yeah, exactly.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.443
Turn around, let
me see your back.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.179
Oh, nice, got your
delts coming in.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.414
Cool, cool, cool, cool. Let
me see that mid-section.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.349
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.319
-It's time we go ahead and get it up.
-Swell it up.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.721
Shit, you ready to blast off?
Here's what I got, man.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.157
Let me know exactly what you got
going, do you know what I'm saying?

15:48.181 --> 15:48.758
-Thank you, yeah.
-And then we can

15:48.770 --> 15:49.358
go ahead and get it cracking,

15:49.382 --> 15:52.352
you know what I'm saying?

16:03.496 --> 16:06.442
Are you still too skinny?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.154
Um, Mr. Louis? Um, Mr. Louis?

16:32.725 --> 16:35.338
Nice job.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.340
Pick it up, please.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.132
The phone.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.747
No, he smell like old meat.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.649
Yeah, I know. It was pretty...

16:46.673 --> 16:49.218
- Uh-huh, just 19.95.
- Good work.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.654
Why don't you go ahead and
give me your credit card?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.658
No, miss, you have my
word, I was a boy scout.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.876
-Yeah, I, no, I know that

16:56.888 --> 16:58.094
doesn't really matter... -pst.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.129
But I'm just saying, it'll
change your life forever.

17:00.153 --> 17:03.256
-Good morning.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.209
- Hey, morning.
- Morning.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.278
-Good.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.646
Normal day. At work.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.148
It's my birthday, big nose.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.617
Happy birthday, buddy!

17:21.641 --> 17:23.551
- Oh, ho, thanks!
- Yeah, sorry, man.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.686
Yeah, sorry.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.622
-You're one of those.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.692
-That whines and cries on his birthday.
-Yeah, I am.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.427
Hey, you coming tonight?

17:31.451 --> 17:34.297
The bar? We're gonna get wasted.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.599
Bar to get wasted. Can't wait.

17:36.623 --> 17:41.570
Great! Guess what? My mom packed
you a piece of birthday cake.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.172
Huh?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.740
Better eat it! It's my birthday.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.409
- I'll eat it.
- See you at lunch.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.600
See you, man.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.833
- Hey.
- You're late, man.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.701
Hey, I'm sorry.
How's everything?

18:12.725 --> 18:16.163
All right, cheers, guys. Cheers!

18:18.898 --> 18:20.667
Let's go get more, huh?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.776
Oh, my god! Yes!

18:33.913 --> 18:37.160
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

18:37.184 --> 18:39.386
- Nine more.
- Yeah!

18:50.463 --> 18:51.774
- Hey.
- Whoa.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.201
Uh, this is one
person only, man.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.548
Whoa.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.430
What's the matter?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.256
You got stage fright?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.201
Whoo!

19:32.605 --> 19:33.906
See you out there.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.683
I wanna go to karaoke.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.438
Oh, you're kidding! Hey, hey!

19:55.462 --> 19:56.929
Excuse you. Who are you?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.200
Whoo! Welcome to my party.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.738
It's not cool. Welcome
to my fucking bar,

20:06.973 --> 20:09.017
I run this show.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.843
You have stage fright, bro?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.450
Hey!

25:26.225 --> 25:30.272
Bro, what's up with the limp?

25:30.296 --> 25:31.798
Hey, Ethan.

25:34.801 --> 25:38.981
Yikes. Whoa, dude,
you look like shit.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.750
You look like you just
had sex with a turd.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.242
Nice one. I'm fine.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.622
Jesus.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.257
You look horrible. Are you ill?

25:49.281 --> 25:52.027
Let me tell you something, pal,
you better not get me sick.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.062
You get me sick and
I will kill you,

25:54.086 --> 25:56.031
and then I will
fucking fire you.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.266
You probably should fire him
first, and then kill him.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.303
Yeah, I'm not even sick, sir,
I'm just trying to get to work.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.673
- Because you can't...
You can't fire him...

26:04.697 --> 26:06.341
You can't kill him,
and then fire him.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.111
No, I think you're wrong. If
I have a gallon of gasoline

26:09.135 --> 26:11.714
that I dump over his fucking
head and then ignite it,

26:11.738 --> 26:15.217
-i could do just that, couldn't I?
-Yeah.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.887
Check, please. Go. Let's go. Out!
Out, out, out, out, out.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.723
I don't want you to get the
rest of these people infected.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.390
-It'll be counted as a sick day.
-All right.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.260
Feel better. You know, I
think it's going around.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.363
I woke up today, I have a
little congestion myself, sir.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.832
You know what's going around?

26:29.856 --> 26:31.734
Assholeism.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.870
I think you've caught a very,
very, very, severe case of it.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.696
Come with me.

26:58.685 --> 27:01.229
How you feeling?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.165
Not great, but I'll live.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.934
But you're going to the gym?

27:05.958 --> 27:10.205
Yeah, you know, I figure I'll
sweat out whatever this flu is.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.932
I hear resting works, too.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.924
Hey, hey, buddy.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.160
Excuse me, I'll get the doctor.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.828
You're in the hospital.

28:39.852 --> 28:42.064
You had some kind of accident.

28:42.088 --> 28:46.468
- Okay, good, Mr. Stenson.
You're awake.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.170
How are you feeling?

28:48.194 --> 28:50.405
Head is killing me.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.474
Because you were unconscious
for so long we're gonna

28:52.498 --> 28:55.034
keep you for an extra
night, just to be safe.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.146
I should finish his check up.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.949
I'm gonna need a quick few
minutes alone with Adam,

29:00.973 --> 29:02.918
if that's all right?

29:02.942 --> 29:04.811
Sure.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.194
Are you warm enough?

29:12.218 --> 29:13.252
Yeah.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.001
Sorry.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.127
- Won't be long.
- Thank you.

29:26.165 --> 29:29.878
Do you have any recollection
of what happened to you?

29:29.902 --> 29:32.414
No, not really. I was...

29:32.438 --> 29:35.583
I was at home and,
um, I don't...

29:35.607 --> 29:38.954
You fainted. It was the result
of having a high fever.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.489
The high fever was
caused by an infection

29:41.513 --> 29:44.092
in your right gluteus minor.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.594
That's your right butt cheek.

29:46.618 --> 29:51.399
That type of infection is
also called an abscess.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.402
We usually see that in someone
who's injected themselves

29:54.426 --> 29:55.603
with a dirty needle.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.373
Adam, please, hey,
hey, look at me.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.042
Can you hear me? Look at me.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.343
What the fuck is going on?

30:01.367 --> 30:02.477
-Look at me. !

30:02.501 --> 30:04.146
What the fuck is going on?

30:04.170 --> 30:07.415
Huh? What the fuck is this
shit everywhere, Adam?

30:07.439 --> 30:09.584
You've been shooting steroids.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.955
Your wife told us. She
also covered for you,

30:12.979 --> 30:18.985
which is none of my business, but
I thought I'd keep this discreet.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.499
You could have died.

30:24.523 --> 30:29.037
Listen, it seems like you
have a wonderful family,

30:29.061 --> 30:31.940
I don't wanna see you
in this hospital again.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.476
Do you understand me?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.544
Yes, sir.

30:36.568 --> 30:39.047
Okay, good.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.149
Well, enjoy the visit
with your family,

30:41.173 --> 30:42.985
and try and get some rest.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.211
They can take you
home in the morning.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.505
I don't even know
what to say to you.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.374
I don't.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.676
I knew that you had to
learn your fucking lesson,

31:08.700 --> 31:12.547
but Adam, what the fuck
were you thinking, huh?

31:12.571 --> 31:15.017
What the fuck were you thinking?

31:15.041 --> 31:18.053
What about me? What
about me, Adam?

31:18.077 --> 31:20.288
What about your fucking family?

31:20.312 --> 31:23.391
You, you scared the
shit out of me.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.328
You did, and I don't understand
what the fuck you were thinking,

31:26.352 --> 31:28.054
I don't, Adam.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.667
You know what? Don't
say anything,

31:32.691 --> 31:34.702
because I'm not sure that
there's anything to say.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.940
You are done. Do you hear me?

31:37.964 --> 31:40.008
You are done with
all of that shit,

31:40.032 --> 31:42.945
and we are together
gonna go home,

31:42.969 --> 31:44.679
and we're gonna go
have a normal life

31:44.703 --> 31:47.615
like two fucking normal people.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.218
Okay?

31:50.242 --> 31:53.212
And that's the thing.
That's what we're gonna do.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.526
Okay?

31:58.550 --> 32:02.654
By the way, I threw away all of
that shit of yours last night.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.185
The conscious mind
is a critical mind,

32:23.209 --> 32:25.320
and it's a mind
that is right now,

32:25.344 --> 32:28.456
and it's deciding whether what I'm
telling you is right for you or not,

32:28.480 --> 32:32.160
but the subconscious mind is totally
non-critical, non-judgmental,

32:32.184 --> 32:35.487
and it's where you'll set good,
positive and powerful suggestions.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.842
So you like that
profile picture?

33:54.866 --> 33:58.846
Yeah, no, no, I just
put that one up.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.084
Yeah, ah, no, I
love puppies, yeah.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.719
No, I don't, I don't. I live
with my mom, and she...

34:04.743 --> 34:06.654
She doesn't let me
have any dogs, but...

34:06.678 --> 34:09.857
Otherwise I'd have probably,
like, so many dogs, yeah,

34:09.880 --> 34:11.226
but puppies.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.318
Yeah, yeah.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.199
Oh, dude, you scared...

34:17.223 --> 34:20.202
Bro, I have phone
sex with this girl

34:20.226 --> 34:21.768
every day.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.163
I am not even gonna
ask about that.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.476
Man, dude, this girl, I'm
telling you, killer.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.844
- Killer.
- Cool.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.447
Brazilian.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.649
I mean, she's not, but
she looks Brazilian.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.418
Hey, welcome back.
We've missed you.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.154
Mr. Louis has been
circling your desk.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.547
- I think he missed you.
- Dude, that's weird.

34:46.552 --> 34:50.665
Boys, you do realize
that we're a team.

34:50.688 --> 34:55.570
We're a team. All of us are
components of this great team.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.239
What I can't figure
out though is,

34:57.263 --> 34:59.441
who's in what position
of the battery.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.576
You know what the battery
is in baseball, right?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.511
The battery?

35:03.535 --> 35:06.514
-No. -The battery is your
pitcher, your catcher.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.583
Up until this moment,
I couldn't figure out

35:08.607 --> 35:11.453
who is the pitcher, and
who is the catcher,

35:11.477 --> 35:14.456
because in my opinion, you're
both fucking catchers.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.492
See, I'm on the hill here, and I'm
throwing straight fucking heat,

35:17.516 --> 35:19.527
and that heat is being
taken by the catcher

35:19.551 --> 35:21.196
right in his fucking ass,

35:21.220 --> 35:23.465
and it smells like shit
back here right now, pal.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.932
-You know what I'm talking about?
-Mm-hmm.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.635
Okay. So stop signaling
for the curve ball,

35:27.659 --> 35:29.795
when you know I want
the fucking heat.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.310
Wow.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.612
He missed you.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.949
Get back to work. See you.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.753
Stop being a baby.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.722
-No.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.415
Close your eyes.
One, two, three.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.828
-Oh. That didn't hurt.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.797
- You're such a baby.
- I know, ooh.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.699
- Come on, it's not that bad.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.801
It actually really isn't that bad.
It's healing.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.704
-Yeah, it looks good.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.939
I think I'm gonna go
back to the gym soon.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.375
Soon? - Like tonight.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.311
-No, I feel good.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.213
-No. -It will make
me feel better.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.415
You feel good? You
can't even sit down.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.882
- I can sit.
- You can't go to the gym.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.518
- Yes.
- Uh, no.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.386
- The doctor said, you know...
- The doctor said...

36:18.410 --> 36:19.854
If I called your
doctor right now,

36:19.878 --> 36:21.456
would he say that you
should go to the gym?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.482
-Yes. -I don't think so.
Stop it.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.015
Oh, shit! I got you,
man, a spot, g.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.751
Come on, man, push!

37:01.853 --> 37:04.766
-It's 95 pounds, nigga, push!
-I can't.

37:04.790 --> 37:05.991
Ah!

37:07.726 --> 37:09.637
Get your ass up.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.730
You have to be more
careful, asshole.

37:14.666 --> 37:18.446
Get up. Pathetic.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.882
You know, I've been seeing
you here a lot lately, man.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.750
You've been hitting
that shit pretty hard.

37:22.774 --> 37:26.321
But you know what? Showing
up is only part of the job.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.657
It's about what the fuck
you do once you get here.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.460
See, you remind me of myself.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.596
I used to bust my ass, man,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.532
and no gains.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.291
Day in, day fucking out.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.704
Well, guess what?

37:42.728 --> 37:47.875
All that changed the first
moment I jumped on a cycle.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.677
A cycle?

37:49.701 --> 37:52.480
Yeah, gear.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.081
You mean like

37:54.105 --> 37:56.784
what the fuck do you
know about fina?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.453
I made some.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.921
Wait a minute. Come back.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.525
-Yeah.

38:03.549 --> 38:06.093
Get the fuck outta here!
You made some fina?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.830
And what happened?

38:08.854 --> 38:10.489
I got an infection.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.671
You trying to kill
your fucking self?

38:16.695 --> 38:19.331
That's what happens when
you use dirty shit.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.534
You know what?

38:24.536 --> 38:26.748
I'm gonna help you.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.083
I'm gonna put you
on some clean shit.

38:29.107 --> 38:32.554
Oh, uh, I am... I'm not, um...

38:32.578 --> 38:33.945
You scared?

38:37.683 --> 38:39.794
Get the fuck outta here.

38:39.818 --> 38:43.130
Look, you see the guy over there?
Don't make it obvious.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.956
The guy over there
in the corner.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.939
Do you think that's natural?

38:51.963 --> 38:54.809
No.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.602
Guess who did that.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.754
Man, fuck what you heard, man.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.523
Fuck what you heard
about steroids

39:08.547 --> 39:12.026
being all bad and shit for you.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.853
They're only bad if you don't
know what the fuck you're doing.

39:16.455 --> 39:19.434
But if you know how
to use them right,

39:19.458 --> 39:21.827
that's what you look like.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.472
That's what you look like.

39:24.496 --> 39:27.609
It's not about
mistreating your body.

39:27.633 --> 39:31.102
It's about treating your body.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.444
You understand?

39:43.515 --> 39:45.026
My nigga.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.761
-There she is. How you doing?
-Hi.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.130
Take your shoes off. I
see them on the carpet.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.733
- You know how I
feel about that.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.168
You're all sweaty. Can you
change your shirt, please

39:54.192 --> 39:56.003
everything in the
basket is clean,

39:56.027 --> 39:57.987
- but that is just so wet.
- All right, all right.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.175
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.578
-Can you take your shoes off?
-Sorry.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.013
Kind of the house rule, you
gotta take your shoes off,

40:06.037 --> 40:08.450
so you don't bring the dirt inside.
You get it?

40:08.474 --> 40:10.585
-Got it.

40:10.609 --> 40:13.455
That's much better. Much better.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.757
- I see you met asshole.
- I did, hello, asshole.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.124
Asshole, this is my girl, Trish.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.826
Hi Trish, it's Adam.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.529
No, whatever. Potential client.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.731
Okay, well, go do your thing.
I'll be here.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.600
- Don't mind me.
- All right, come on, man,

40:25.624 --> 40:26.825
- let's go.
- Okay.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.176
So, what do you think?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.244
Holy shit, man. You're
like a pharmacy.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.946
Goddamn right. My very own

40:38.970 --> 40:41.206
body enhancement franchise.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.086
-Sorry, man, just...

40:45.110 --> 40:46.721
- Don't touch shit.
- Fucking needles, man.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.756
Don't yell at him. He
still has to buy it.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.058
Would you let me handle my
business, baby? God damn.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.727
Don't yell at me!

40:52.751 --> 40:56.063
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.499
It hurts my feelings.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.734
Okay.

40:59.758 --> 41:03.104
So listen, this is
what we gonna do.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.807
Cypionate. Testosterone.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.274
Babe, we gotta go
to dinner soon,

41:07.298 --> 41:09.210
so I want you to
start getting ready.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.245
Okay, all right. Let
me go ahead and finish

41:11.269 --> 41:13.247
handling this business,
baby, all right?

41:13.271 --> 41:15.149
You gotta take down
that serial killer shit

41:15.173 --> 41:17.552
on the walls before I
start cooking again.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.086
- Okay.
- That's scary as fuck.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.512
All right!

41:22.814 --> 41:24.792
This right here is my favorite.

41:24.816 --> 41:28.563
Deca, it's for your bulking
and for your joints.

41:28.587 --> 41:33.167
You're gonna take two shots
of each once a week.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.137
That's the least
of your worries.

41:36.161 --> 41:39.941
That abscess shit happened because
you were shooting some dirty shit.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.777
All right? Besides, you didn't
know what the fuck you were doing.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.936
I don't know, man, it's just...

41:47.673 --> 41:49.984
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

41:50.008 --> 41:51.719
Man, I don't... I don't...

41:51.743 --> 41:53.755
Listen, every time you feeling

41:53.779 --> 41:56.223
that queasy-ass shit
you're feeling,

41:56.247 --> 42:01.219
look at yourself in the mirror and
say, "do I like the way I look?"

42:03.288 --> 42:06.291
Answer, "fuck no," and shoot.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.173
Listen, man, I'm gonna
do you a favor,

42:12.197 --> 42:16.343
I had my shots today. I'm gonna
show you how to do it, okay?

42:16.367 --> 42:20.648
- Yeah, I'm about to do it now.
You got a problem with that?

42:20.672 --> 42:23.918
No.

42:23.942 --> 42:27.154
One inch syringes.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.781
You're gonna extract one cc.

42:31.316 --> 42:32.594
One.

42:32.618 --> 42:34.161
All right?

42:34.185 --> 42:37.331
I'm gonna put the
lid back on it.

42:37.355 --> 42:39.734
It pops right off.

42:39.758 --> 42:40.992
Discard.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.296
Grab a whole 'nother needle.

42:48.834 --> 42:50.311
Twist it on.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.779
You're ready to go.

42:51.803 --> 42:54.015
Man, I don't know. I
don't know about...

42:54.039 --> 42:56.217
Look, man the fuck up!

42:56.241 --> 42:59.077
You're a grown-ass man,
stop being a little bitch!

43:01.880 --> 43:03.749
I'm wasting my fucking
time with you?

43:08.053 --> 43:10.798
All right, we're gonna
do this shit again.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.835
Walk me through the process.

43:13.859 --> 43:16.161
- Talk to me!
- Switch... switch needles now.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.236
Ready to go.

43:26.404 --> 43:29.107
- Alcohol.
- Alcohol prep.

43:33.779 --> 43:35.957
You ready? - Uh-uh.

43:35.981 --> 43:37.615
You're such a bitch.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.869
No blood. A little oil.

43:47.893 --> 43:49.303
No vein.

43:49.327 --> 43:50.796
All muscle.

43:52.798 --> 43:55.910
Don't worry. You'll
get used to it.

43:55.934 --> 43:57.969
Come on. You're acting
like a little bitch.

44:02.941 --> 44:04.375
Hey...

44:06.211 --> 44:09.114
-here. -No, thanks,
I don't smoke.

44:14.786 --> 44:18.766
Get it anyway, nigga,
get it anyway!

44:18.790 --> 44:21.335
Tell me no in my
motherfucking house?

44:21.359 --> 44:22.970
It's fucking terrible over here.

44:22.994 --> 44:26.407
- Oh, god.
- It's really thick.

44:26.431 --> 44:32.213
Well, look, I was
contemplating this,

44:32.237 --> 44:37.418
but how about you go ahead and
make the delivery for me,

44:37.442 --> 44:41.055
and make sure he's straight?

44:41.079 --> 44:46.794
I'll cover your package. No need
to worry about it, all right?

44:46.818 --> 44:51.766
- I don't know, man,
maybe I can pay for it?

44:51.790 --> 44:54.268
Well, shit, nigga, go ahead
and give me $600 right now.

44:54.292 --> 44:59.040
-Yeah, $100 a bottle, man.

44:59.064 --> 45:01.266
Man, look, do you
want this or not?

45:04.002 --> 45:09.884
Okay, so, if I do this, um, I
guess, just so we're clear,

45:09.908 --> 45:11.877
I'm delivering steroids?

45:30.095 --> 45:33.131
Hey, uh, Jason sent me.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.234
Come in?

45:41.106 --> 45:42.984
Let me clear a spot for you.

45:43.008 --> 45:45.987
Sorry. Here we go.

45:46.011 --> 45:48.255
- Sit down.
- All right, thanks.

45:48.279 --> 45:50.157
Can I get you
something to drink?

45:50.181 --> 45:51.292
-No, I'm okay.

45:51.316 --> 45:53.327
-No.

45:53.351 --> 45:56.097
-Yeah. -You know, I make a
bad-ass protein shake, boss.

45:56.121 --> 45:58.199
I... I appreciate
it, but I'm good.

45:58.223 --> 46:01.568
I think you need one.
I'll get you one, okay?

46:01.592 --> 46:04.171
By the way, my name is Peter.
Nice to meet you.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.763
I'm Adam.

46:11.302 --> 46:13.447
So how long you known Jason for?

46:13.471 --> 46:15.907
Oh, I just... I just
met him recently.

46:39.364 --> 46:41.066
One bad-ass shake coming up.

46:46.905 --> 46:48.115
-Good.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.616
Mm-hmm, yeah, it's pretty good.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.343
I told you. I make a
bad-ass protein shake.

46:55.013 --> 46:58.059
You know what? In my
mind, there's no excuse

46:58.083 --> 47:02.196
for being anything less
than strong as possible.

47:02.220 --> 47:06.067
Stronger is better.

47:06.091 --> 47:10.304
I didn't want to inject this
crap into my body, to be honest,

47:10.328 --> 47:12.373
but I had to.

47:12.397 --> 47:18.079
And now that I've done it,
I mean, I love steroids.

47:18.103 --> 47:20.347
I think I'll be...
Be on and off them

47:20.371 --> 47:22.540
for the rest of my life.

47:25.944 --> 47:27.879
I mean, are steroids safe?

49:46.451 --> 49:50.431
Damn, my shit blowing up like
grand central station over here.

49:50.455 --> 49:52.699
Man, shit, I'm running
out of everything, too.

49:52.723 --> 49:56.603
Tricia will be mad, but I have to set
the laboratory up one more again.

49:56.627 --> 49:59.040
This money looking too
good right about now.

49:59.064 --> 50:02.576
Hey, man, you gonna have to help
me bag some of this shit up, bro.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.511
You're over here
ripping your face off.

50:04.535 --> 50:06.213
Look at you, you high as shit.

50:06.237 --> 50:08.049
-That's some good shit, ain't it?
-Uh-huh.

50:08.073 --> 50:10.384
How you feel?

50:10.408 --> 50:12.419
-All right.

50:12.443 --> 50:14.355
You look big as shit, dog.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.490
-Shut up. -No, for real, man.
Stand up.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.326
- I just smoked. I'm high.
- Man, get the fuck up, now.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.752
Come on, man. This is free
body building advice.

50:23.554 --> 50:25.123
Peel off, man. Let me see.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.760
You're looking like a
chippendale dancer and shit.

50:32.230 --> 50:33.740
Pull it off, man.

50:33.764 --> 50:36.410
You worked so hard, can't
be afraid to show it off.

50:36.434 --> 50:39.846
Well, you done packed on some serious
mass since last time we saw you.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.515
Face me.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.817
All right, pecs coming in,
body fat is dropping,

50:43.841 --> 50:46.720
picking up. Come on, turn
around, turn around.

50:46.744 --> 50:48.122
Good, man. Look at you.

50:48.146 --> 50:49.590
Back is all getting wide.

50:49.614 --> 50:50.691
Delts coming in.

50:50.715 --> 50:53.460
Man, do you feel bigger?

50:53.484 --> 50:56.130
-No. -I know you're
feeling stronger.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.764
-I mean, not really.

50:57.788 --> 50:58.782
-Yeah. -You feel like a human

50:58.794 --> 50:59.800
pincushion, don't you?

50:59.824 --> 51:03.704
- My ass is killing me though.
- Man, that's part of it, man.

51:03.728 --> 51:06.497
Man, sit down, dog, look.
Help me bag this shit up.

51:08.166 --> 51:10.344
-Oh! Forgot, this is for you.

51:10.368 --> 51:11.812
This is your pct.
Pull cycle therapy.

51:11.836 --> 51:13.647
This is some real
important shit.

51:13.671 --> 51:16.250
Most people don't even do it.
They're crazy if they don't.

51:16.274 --> 51:17.718
But for you, you're
gonna take it.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.753
This is the best
and the safest way

51:19.777 --> 51:22.623
to return your body
back to homeostasis

51:22.647 --> 51:24.891
while keeping your muscle gains.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.418
-Hmm. -Here. Start
on that real soon.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.831
All right, hurry up, man.
Come on, dog!

51:30.855 --> 51:34.168
Here you go. Come on, two of the
green, and one of everything else,

51:34.192 --> 51:35.402
-all right.

51:35.426 --> 51:37.238
Throw in a few syringes
and shit, man,

51:37.262 --> 51:38.439
just to get them started.

51:38.463 --> 51:39.606
I ain't no motherfucking
pharmacist.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.232
I'm their pusher, baby.

51:46.171 --> 51:47.814
âª Bewildered herds,
sharpen your teeth âª

51:47.838 --> 51:49.683
âª remember these three quotes

51:49.707 --> 51:52.553
âª only lie to cameras
cops and crooks âª

51:52.577 --> 51:54.488
âª see kindness is
within our power âª

51:54.512 --> 51:55.856
âª but fondess is not

51:55.880 --> 51:57.458
âª under the false
umbrella of hope âª

51:57.482 --> 51:59.493
âª lives are sold,
people are bought âª

51:59.517 --> 52:02.263
âª somebody once told me all
men were created equal âª

52:02.287 --> 52:03.930
âª you're not created
in the womb âª

52:03.954 --> 52:06.367
âª you're created in a
classroom by rich people âª

52:06.391 --> 52:09.536
âª and history is written through
the eyes of the butcher âª

52:09.560 --> 52:12.773
âª those who benefit from an ignorant
public condescends and insult you âª

52:12.797 --> 52:14.641
âª they built you in
the image of slaves âª

52:14.665 --> 52:16.543
âª the free men got locked up

52:16.567 --> 52:17.644
âª as long as they control the
means of selling beliefs âª

52:17.668 --> 52:19.680
âª no man is equal

52:19.704 --> 52:22.549
âª if there's a policeman living
in your head you're not free âª

52:22.573 --> 52:24.418
âª cause the free
trade were real âª

52:24.442 --> 52:25.952
âª everyone would own a company âª

52:25.976 --> 52:28.722
âª all that is solid
has melted into air âª

52:28.746 --> 52:30.757
âª it doesn't matter
who you vote for âª

52:30.781 --> 52:32.959
âª the government
will always get in âª

52:32.983 --> 52:36.363
âª all that was once solved
is now too late to air âª

52:36.387 --> 52:39.266
âª 100,000,000 lemmings
can't be wrong âª

52:39.290 --> 52:41.602
âª people join the army
to pay for college âª

52:41.626 --> 52:44.771
âª in California residents
go to college for free âª

52:44.795 --> 52:48.242
âª what will you do ,smoke weed
on the weekends and go hiking âª

52:48.266 --> 52:52.413
âª or serve the white collar death
squad of an oil company military âª

52:52.437 --> 52:55.782
âª everybody wants heaven
but nobody wants dead âª

52:55.806 --> 52:59.320
âª we are living in a rich man's
heaven, a poor man's hell âª

52:59.344 --> 53:01.922
âª the middle class is dwindling
the population is doubling âª

53:01.946 --> 53:04.891
âª we are not living in Rome,
we've been living in a fifedom âª

53:04.915 --> 53:06.927
âª so when they remap
all the genomes âª

53:06.951 --> 53:08.962
âª remember it's a
hate-free zone âª

53:08.986 --> 53:11.698
âª cause money doesn't
care who burns it âª

53:11.722 --> 53:13.334
âª they left the door open

53:13.358 --> 53:15.660
âª 'cause the best
illusions are half-real âª

53:30.908 --> 53:32.810
Hi.

53:33.811 --> 53:36.590
Who were you talking to?

53:36.614 --> 53:39.826
What are you talking about?
I'm reading.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.995
I swear I heard you
talking to somebody.

53:42.019 --> 53:44.798
No, I'm talking to no one.
Are you tired?

53:44.822 --> 53:46.800
Or crazy?

53:46.824 --> 53:48.702
I'm tired. I don't know.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.804
And you're pretty stinky.

53:50.828 --> 53:52.839
You smell me from there?

53:52.863 --> 53:55.276
I can smell you from
here, and it's not good.

53:55.300 --> 53:56.610
Can you take a shower though,

53:56.634 --> 53:58.612
because I just
cleaned the sheets,

53:58.636 --> 54:00.881
and it smells really
good over here,

54:00.905 --> 54:03.784
and we can cuddle before bed.

54:03.808 --> 54:05.786
Do you wanna jump in
the shower with me?

54:05.810 --> 54:09.890
I know I said I would, but I'm so tired.
I had a long day.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.658
Really?

54:11.682 --> 54:13.427
I know. I'm a promise breaker,

54:13.451 --> 54:14.528
but I promise tomorrow.

54:14.552 --> 54:15.529
Promise.

54:15.553 --> 54:17.431
Okay.

54:17.455 --> 54:19.065
See you in a bit.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.834
Okay. Hurry up!

54:20.858 --> 54:22.493
Okay.

55:37.034 --> 55:39.112
Don't stop, my boy, just
keep going... go on.

55:39.136 --> 55:41.047
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop.
Don't stop.

55:41.071 --> 55:43.617
-Listen.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.752
I just told you
don't fucking stop.

55:45.776 --> 55:47.588
Be natural, goddamn it!

55:47.612 --> 55:50.123
-Put the fucking weights back up.
-Well...

55:50.147 --> 55:53.059
Listen, I need you
to go to the back,

55:53.083 --> 55:56.096
far right corner,
grab my bag, okay?

55:56.120 --> 55:58.131
Just grab my bag and
wait about five minutes,

55:58.155 --> 56:00.567
-meet me at the house.

56:00.591 --> 56:01.986
-Motherfucker, if you drop them

56:01.998 --> 56:03.404
weights one more time... -fuck!

56:03.428 --> 56:05.572
- I said be natural.
- All right.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.474
Five minutes. Grab my bag,

56:07.498 --> 56:09.410
let me leave this motherfucker.

56:09.434 --> 56:11.445
Meet me at the house,
can you do that?

56:11.469 --> 56:12.913
You're gonna do that. My nigga,

56:12.937 --> 56:13.971
don't worry about that.

56:33.624 --> 56:35.068
-Shh shh.

56:35.092 --> 56:37.137
Was anybody following us?

56:37.161 --> 56:39.005
-I don't know... -was
somebody following you, bro?

56:39.029 --> 56:40.674
-I don't know.

56:40.698 --> 56:43.544
- No, I wasn't.
- Fuck.

56:43.568 --> 56:45.035
Hold on.

56:47.638 --> 56:51.217
The whole thing at the gym
was freaking me out, bro.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.953
Shit.

56:52.977 --> 56:55.112
Now do me a favor, man,
pack your boy one up.

56:57.648 --> 57:00.527
Come on, dog, I can't fuck with
this shit right now sober,

57:00.551 --> 57:02.496
I need to be high.

57:02.520 --> 57:04.188
They motherfuckers.

57:07.224 --> 57:10.003
Let me tell you something.

57:10.027 --> 57:14.174
What happened today is because some
people were just hating on me, dog.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.677
Just hating on me, for
no reason at all.

57:16.701 --> 57:18.111
They mad 'cause
I'm making money.

57:18.135 --> 57:19.980
They're trying to fuck
up my business, though.

57:20.004 --> 57:21.648
You scared the shit
outta me, man,

57:21.672 --> 57:23.116
I don't even know what to think.

57:23.140 --> 57:24.951
Yeah, man, I know.

57:24.975 --> 57:26.820
I need to be fucking
high right now,

57:26.844 --> 57:28.889
I can't deal with
this shit sober.

57:28.913 --> 57:31.925
Come on, man, dude, you packing
that bitch really slow right now.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.118
Come on, dog, god damn.

57:35.620 --> 57:37.722
You're so god damn
slow at everything.

57:48.766 --> 57:49.910
Yeah.

57:49.934 --> 57:51.134
That's what I'm talking about.

57:56.574 --> 57:59.620
Hey, man, I'm gonna
need more soon.

57:59.644 --> 58:01.121
More what?

58:01.145 --> 58:04.124
Uh, tests.

58:04.148 --> 58:07.017
I dropped a bottle off
the counter today.

58:14.024 --> 58:17.938
Don't be doing more than I
fucking tell you to do.

58:17.962 --> 58:20.674
Do you think I'm stupid, man?

58:20.698 --> 58:23.877
You do it like I
told you to do it.

58:23.901 --> 58:27.147
This shit will fuck you up.

58:27.171 --> 58:30.884
I'm talking about bitch tits,
I'm talking about acne.

58:30.908 --> 58:34.254
All that ugly shit.

58:34.278 --> 58:38.058
You know what? Let me
tell you something.

58:38.082 --> 58:42.896
People who take this
shit work twice as hard

58:42.920 --> 58:44.898
than people who don't.

58:44.922 --> 58:46.199
You wanna become a
fucking olympian?

58:46.223 --> 58:48.134
You wanna win a gold medal?

58:48.158 --> 58:53.206
They take this shit, and
they work their asses off,

58:53.230 --> 58:55.075
for every second, every minute,

58:55.099 --> 58:57.143
and every hour of their session.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.880
They go balls out.

58:59.904 --> 59:02.172
So there's no easy way
around this shit.

59:07.377 --> 59:11.024
Man, I'm sorry, dog.
I'm fucking tripping.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.760
That shit wasn't
even for you, homie.

59:13.784 --> 59:17.664
You know what, my bad.
I was wrong.

59:17.688 --> 59:19.933
Look, go ahead, take
whatever you need.

59:19.957 --> 59:22.302
All right? Take
whatever you need.

59:22.326 --> 59:23.937
I'm sorry, man.

59:23.961 --> 59:26.740
Do me a favor. Go ahead,
rip your face off.

59:26.764 --> 59:29.876
That's the least I could do, man,
for you looking out for me, dog.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.779
That was real gangster
shit you did earlier,

59:32.803 --> 59:34.247
and I appreciate that.

59:34.271 --> 59:35.973
Real tough.

59:39.276 --> 59:41.245
Yeah, look at you.

59:43.781 --> 59:45.282
My nigga.

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:24.130
Mmm.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:25.231
How's breakfast?

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.400
It's all good. These eggs?

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:29.435
They're the same eggs
I make you every day.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.037
Do you want some coffee?

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.739
I'm okay, thanks.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.131
What do you wanna
do this weekend?

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.306
- It's so mean. I hate the zoo.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.887
Well, cause it's mean
locking them up and then...

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.923
I told you that.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:52.216
-Hold on a second.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.695
I like that dress.

01:00:54.719 --> 01:00:56.429
Thank you.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:59.800
I ordered it online. I didn't
think it was gonna fit, but...

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.434
- It's pretty cute.
- Yeah.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:04.270
-It's red and bright.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.739
Thank you.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:07.073
So, what's your day like?

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:08.875
Do you think you'll
be out early?

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.713
Ah, definitely not being
able to get out early,

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:15.782
but, you know, there's more
selling people self-help books

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:18.384
that probably need help,
but can't admit it.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.144
I'm getting yelled at.

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:27.027
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.962
-Off! Take off your pants.

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:30.831
What is fucking wrong with you?

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:32.866
- And show me that you're
not shooting up again!

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.802
Prove it to me! Prove it to me
you're not shooting up again, huh?

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:40.140
Okay, so, I am doing steroids,
yes, but they are safe.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:41.174
-Yes.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.076
I fucking hate you, Adam.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.745
I hate you and you're a liar.

01:01:44.769 --> 01:01:46.079
Sara!

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:47.480
Can you stop?

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:49.783
You lied! Don't tell
me to calm down.

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:52.986
Do not tell me to calm down!

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.188
Do not tell me to calm down!

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.390
Sara... why do... what about us?

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:58.992
There is no us, Adam.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:01.952
There is no us
until you fix you!

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:43.103
This is a telemarketing call, sir,
but I have a special offer today

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:48.132
on a subscription to a self-help
book that I think might help you.

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:51.978
Hello? Ah, yes, this
is Adam stenson.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:54.447
I'm seeing if you
had a moment...

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:57.984
[indistinct response on
phone, phone clicks]

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.153
Hello, my name is Adam stenson.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:01.454
How are you today?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.189
Yes, this is a
telemarketing call.

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.815
Fuck off.

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:09.746
Okay, great. I have
a great deal on a

01:03:09.758 --> 01:03:12.198
subscription that could
change your life today.

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:15.368
Uh, it's for 19.95, and I
think you'd really love it.

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:17.237
You understand me, dog?

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:19.572
You a fucking retard
or something?

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:22.843
-I'll find you.

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:26.279
No, you know what? How about you listen
to me, you fucking piece of shit.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.114
Do you know how many fuckers
like you I deal with

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.017
on a daily fucking basis that
show me no goddamn respect?

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:35.312
Huh do you? Hello

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:38.015
fuck!

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.497
Stenson! What the
fuck are you doing?

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:47.167
You're fired! Get out now!

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.093
Now, stenson!

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.142
Oh, you want a piece?
Go ahead, motherfucker,

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.911
take it.

01:03:57.935 --> 01:04:00.370
Come on, man. I'd love it.
Go ahead.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.318
Hold!

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.888
You are making a career
decision right now, my friend.

01:04:07.912 --> 01:04:10.423
Follow him and get the fuck
out and don't ever come back.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:13.393
Otherwise you turn to your
cubicle and get on the phone!

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:16.286
Or I find myself
a new number 15.

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:24.237
That's what I fucking thought.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:27.431
The rest of you motherfuckers,
get on the phone!

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:27.677
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:34.318 --> 01:07:35.752
-Good.

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:41.401
You look really tan.

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:44.337
-No.

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.439
- No, it's okay.
- Yeah, hmm.

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:50.410
It's a lot of tan.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:51.677
You look good though.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.503
Thank you.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:02.188
I missed you.

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:03.823
Do you mean that?

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:05.081
Yeah.

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.295
I missed you, too.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:11.288
Come here.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:16.469
All right, maybe we
should talk first.

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:18.837
We need to talk about things.

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:20.506
Later?

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.566
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:30.943
Adam, ow, ow!

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.877
Adam, wait, what are you doing?

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.514
You're hurting me!

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.349
Listen to me! You're hurting...

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.618
Adam! Stop it!

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:40.420
Stop it! Get off of me!

01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:42.255
What's wrong with you?

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:43.513
What did I do?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.285
-Sara!

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.696
May I help you, motherfucker?

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.966
I'm Adam's father.

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.503
I want you to stay
away from my son.

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:32.405
Do you know where
the fuck you at?

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:33.606
Huh?

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.841
You don't have a clue, do you?

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.810
Look, man, whatever
you're thinking,

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.570
you got this shit all wrong, man, a'ight?
Get the fuck outta here.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.819
You go near my son again,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:50.013
You better get the fuck off
my property right now.

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:54.360
I'll kill you.

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:56.796
You need to get the
fuck up outta here.

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.389
Don't threaten me in
my own fucking house.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:08.532
Hope you make it to the
car, motherfucker!

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.588
Man, rack this shit up.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.725
Come on, man, rack it.

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:28.561
Look...

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:30.630
Look, man, things are a
bit sketchy right now.

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:33.065
- I just thought
I'd let you know.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:35.825
Listen, man, my connect
in China just got popped.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:42.041
I'm low on gear.

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:44.677
So this means that this
may be your last cycle.

01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:46.045
I'm almost out, man.

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:47.813
That's okay.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:51.417
You're coming upon your pct
phase right about now.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:53.819
You get to keep some
of those gains,

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:55.855
you know, let your
receptors recover.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:59.024
Then we hit full
another month or two.

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.661
A month off?

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:03.796
That's the way the
game is played.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.822
Man, fuck that, man!

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:11.027
There he is.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.008
Are you Adam stenson?

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:17.677
Yeah, I'm Adam stenson.

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.812
You're under arrest for
domestic violence.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.847
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:23.749
Anything you say can
and will be used

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.418
against you in a court of law.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.886
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.654
If you can't afford an attorney,

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.056
one will be provided to you.
I've read you your rights.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.458
Do you understand?

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:33.959
Yeah.

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:35.719
You're coming with us.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:50.527
Quite the day.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.076
What's next?

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.678
Honey.

01:13:58.702 --> 01:14:00.713
No, I'm... I'm... I'm
fascinated to find out

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:03.949
what could possibly
be next for Adam.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:08.020
-Honey.

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:11.591
Honey, why don't we talk about
this when we're at home,

01:14:11.615 --> 01:14:12.782
okay?

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:20.065
Adam, we talked and
we think it's best

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.635
if you come back
home with us, okay?

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.604
What the fuck were
you thinking, huh?

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:26.939
-Bob! -Pull over and let
me out of this car.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:27.940
-Let me out.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.609
Oh, fucking relax.

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:30.943
-My god, Adam, you're shaking.
-Listen!

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.178
Pull over and let me out
of this fucking car!

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.880
-Yes, I want...

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.749
-fine. -Let me out
of this fucking car!

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:38.217
Get the fuck out!

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:39.709
What are you doing?

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:50.987
Adam, come on, man!

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.792
Adam, come on, man.

01:14:58.094 --> 01:15:00.005
Don't you get it, man?

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:03.075
Don't you fucking get it that
when the shit hits the fan

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:04.877
that the truth is the only thing

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:07.146
- that's gonna get
you out of it?

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.750
The truth is you've been
in denial my entire life.

01:15:10.774 --> 01:15:12.918
-I'm sorry.

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:15.220
Okay? I'm sorry. I love you.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.556
You're my son.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.190
You're my friend.

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:21.026
But we have given you
everything we can, man.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.762
We did the best we
possibly could.

01:15:22.786 --> 01:15:25.998
The rest is fucking up to you.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.800
Look, I know you're on steroids.

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:29.935
Okay? I get it. You're on drugs.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.271
I understand. I wanna help.

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:35.307
Everybody's on something.
Everybody's on a drug.

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:37.142
Why am I the bad guy?

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.879
Bad I don't give a
shit about that, man,

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:42.181
i... I give a shit that
you're gonna end up

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.949
fucking dead with this.

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:45.818
Okay? That is my biggest fear.

01:15:45.842 --> 01:15:47.953
That has become my biggest fear.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:50.990
You know that?

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:53.292
Well, you shouldn't fear
what you can't control.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:55.160
I don't wanna control you.

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:57.763
Okay? I want to help you.

01:15:57.787 --> 01:15:59.098
I mean, look at you...

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:01.166
For Christ's sake.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:05.137
I mean, look at yourself,
man, look at you.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:09.609
You've got a problem, okay?
But it's not your fault.

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:11.276
Some people live and learn,

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.912
other people just fucking live.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:15.314
And don't try and tell me
you don't have a choice.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:18.383
Don't tell me you don't have
a choice to get out of this

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:19.785
before it's too fucking late,

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:21.854
cause you do!

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.957
You just gotta
realize that life...

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:28.293
Life ain't that fucking hard,
man, life is fucking easy,

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.721
if you just get out of
your own fucking way.

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:36.159
It's so easy for you
to say that, dad.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.130
Adam, come on, man!

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:55.912
Sara.

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.358
No, he's not with us.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:02.361
We... yes, but he
jumped out of the car,

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:05.197
and I don't know
where he is, so...

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:07.757
I tell ya, I'm really scared.

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:10.159
Okay.

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:13.262
Keep your phone on.

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:42.935
Hey.

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:46.029
I promise, I'm gonna
get our boy back.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.477
Hey!

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:39.391
Come on, man, open the door.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:42.185
Come on, man, open the door! I
know you're fucking in there.

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:45.464
Now what the fuck is
your problem, man?

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.499
Huh? Get the fuck
off my property.

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:50.235
- Look, man, I need your help.

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:51.436
Adam's in trouble.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.472
All right, if you help me,

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:56.208
I promise I won't tell the cops
you're a fucking drug dealer.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:57.810
Hey, fuck you, man.

01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:00.545
-Wait a sec. Wait a second.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.815
Look, man, you
gave him the shit.

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:05.450
I was doing my fucking job.
Had you been doing yours,

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.486
you wouldn't be in this
position, now would you?

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:09.288
That's your problem,
man, you fix it.

01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:11.156
-You're right. -Get the
fuck off my property.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.159
Wait. You're right.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.328
Help me save my son, please.

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:19.255
What the fuck do you want
me to do about this, huh?

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:32.368
Well, fuck.

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:43.322
What the fuck?

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:45.357
Calm down, man. We're
here to help you, okay?

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.092
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.560
We're here to help you, Adam.

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:51.897
Sara, called me, okay?
She wanted me here.

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:54.466
Do you want to criticize me
like the rest of the world,

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.236
-is that what the fuck you're doing here?
-She's worried about you

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.804
-cause you're acting crazy.
-Oh, you

01:19:58.816 --> 01:20:00.372
wanna tell me that
I'm not good enough.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:03.876
Calm down, man.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.912
I'm doing something that
makes me feel right,

01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:09.448
and you guys just wanna take
that shit away from me.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:11.316
I'm sorry. I can't... I can't

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.919
hey, hey, hey, Sara, Sara,
Sara, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:16.188
- Go. You let her fucking go.
- Let's talk this through.

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:18.557
- Bro, when have you
cared about anyone

01:20:18.581 --> 01:20:20.893
but your goddamn self, hmm?

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:22.928
- Hey, hey, relax, man.
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:20:22.952 --> 01:20:24.196
- Okay.
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.022
Okay, man.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:30.102
Hey, we love you. We're
here to help, okay?

01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:33.138
We're worried about you.
We're concerned, okay?

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:35.007
- You're acting a little...
- Don't fucking touch me!

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:37.476
- Get the fuck outta my house.
- Stop him! Stop him!

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.178
Go get the fuck out!

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:41.580
No, I told you, I don't
know what's wrong with him.

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:42.982
That is not Adam.

01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.274
It's okay. Okay?
It's gonna be okay.

01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:48.187
What the fuck?

01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:49.445
Fuck.

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:59.999
Adam, open the door, man.

01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:01.400
Come on, man.

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:04.269
Adam, please.

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:06.371
I love you.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:07.973
Mom loves you. Sara loves you.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:11.110
We all love you.
We wanna help you.

01:21:11.134 --> 01:21:14.213
-Let us help you. -Fuck it all.
You can't help me!

01:21:14.237 --> 01:21:17.049
-You can't fucking fix me.

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:19.051
- You can't.
- Knock that bullshit off.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:21.320
Come on, open the fucking door!

01:21:21.344 --> 01:21:23.689
-Fuck. Just leave.
-This is not you,

01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:26.058
this is the shit
you've been taking.

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.583
Let me help you.

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:31.554
I love you, Adam.

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.297
Fuck!

01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:44.476
What

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.147
Adam, don't hang up, okay?

01:21:48.171 --> 01:21:50.415
All right.

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:54.310
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:58.690
I've never told you how
beautiful you are.

01:21:58.714 --> 01:22:01.460
Every muscle, every bone,
every organ is beautiful.

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:04.964
Every fiber of your body is...

01:22:04.988 --> 01:22:08.733
It's beautiful, and it has
been in every way always.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:11.427
You're you. You're just you.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.740
Look, when I saw you today

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:20.379
it hit me like a ton of bricks,
how big you've gotten.

01:22:20.403 --> 01:22:24.216
But that's just the
thing, see, you don't...

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.351
You don't see it, do you?

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.487
You can't see it.

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:30.355
You can't see yourself.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:34.726
The way you are. You're sick.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:40.732
You are physically unable to
see yourself the way you...

01:22:40.756 --> 01:22:46.295
You really are, you... You
can't see your own body.

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.208
You have body dysmorphia.

01:22:49.232 --> 01:22:52.235
But we'll get you help, we will.

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:05.424
Adam?

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:07.216
Do you hear me?

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:11.396
You're gonna be okay.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.799
You just need to hang on. Okay, honey?
Just hang on.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.037
Because I love you,

01:23:18.061 --> 01:23:20.996
and your dad loves you,
and we'll get you help.

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:28.047
You have body dysmorphia.

01:23:28.071 --> 01:23:30.339
Do you know what that is?
Get rid of it.

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:35.387
We're sorry, I love you.

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:38.257
You're my son.

01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:40.392
I know what you're
going through, okay?

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:42.627
Don't touch me. Do you hear me?

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:45.254
You are not yourself anymore!

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.769
Mom, why did you
never say anything?

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:06.109
I didn't know how to tell you.
I didn't know what to say.

01:24:08.611 --> 01:24:12.091
I... I'm sorry.

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:15.594
How could I have told you?

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:18.630
Would it have mattered if I had?

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.556
Would you have listened to me?

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.605
No, I don't give a shit...

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:28.240
- That's bullshit.
- No shit.

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:30.109
Adam, are you there?

01:24:30.133 --> 01:24:33.212
Your wife told us.
No excuse for you.

01:24:33.236 --> 01:24:34.437
Adam?

01:24:42.878 --> 01:24:45.414
I want to help you.

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:51.296
It doesn't matter.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.834
You know, as they say,
beauty is only skin deep.

01:24:55.858 --> 01:24:59.904
We are the only ones in
control of our destiny.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.441
Hey, Adam. Do you know this?

01:25:02.465 --> 01:25:05.434
You have body dysmorphia.
