02:32.719 --> 02:34.887
What was that?

02:34.888 --> 02:37.888
Honey, are the kids
up? What are they doing?

02:41.395 --> 02:44.395
I peed.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.033
Kevin peed the bed.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.467
Our bed? Uh-huh.

02:48.468 --> 02:51.203
All 500 thread counts
of Egyptian cotton.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.305
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

02:53.306 --> 02:55.307
I don't want you to
worry about it, buddy.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.308
It'll happen again your freshman
year of college, trust me.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.813
No more sodas before bed!

03:00.814 --> 03:02.548
Sit down here. But I like soda.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.151
How you doing, big guy? Good morning.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.252
Let's have a big morning!

03:06.253 --> 03:09.253
Let's start off with a little
breakfast, get our Froot Loops.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.824
Here's Daddy's coffee. And I need it.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.326
Here's your bowl of
fruit, without the loops.

03:14.327 --> 03:15.428
Why no loop?

03:15.429 --> 03:16.495
Daddy doesn't need loops.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.930
I gotta eat it. If I eat a big meal now,

03:17.931 --> 03:19.198
then I can watch what I eat later.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.833
Otherwise, I'll get starved
and raid the refrigerator.

03:20.834 --> 03:21.934
Okay, honey. We've got to hurry up,

03:21.935 --> 03:23.035
'cause we got to go to hockey.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.103
I thought you could do that

03:24.104 --> 03:26.238
because I might try to get a
little bit of work done today.

03:26.239 --> 03:29.108
Honey, we have to go by the
showroom and pick out the tile.

03:29.109 --> 03:31.444
I want you to see it. We
talked about this last week

03:31.445 --> 03:34.013
and I told you how
important today was for me.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.615
I'm Mega Man! May the best team win!

03:37.751 --> 03:38.918
Okay, guys, let's keep it down.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.686
Keep the eyes on the... On the screen.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.921
You guys doing good?
- Yes.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.022
Honey? Yeah.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.291
What do you think? Nickel, brushed
nickel, chrome or brushed chrome?

03:45.292 --> 03:46.459
I like the silver ones.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.593
They're all silver.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.795
Well, great. Pick out whichever
knob that you like, then.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.630
No, I'm not gonna pick
whichever knob I like

03:51.631 --> 03:53.432
because you know what's gonna happen?

03:53.433 --> 03:55.201
Is that I'm gonna pick one
and then you're gonna complain

03:55.202 --> 03:56.469
once they're in and
then it'll be too late.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.039
Hello? Dave, where
the heck have you been?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.742
I'm picking out pulls. Why have
you been calling me nonstop?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.743
Well, you know how my credit's
all screwed up because of my wife?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.047
But you're divorced.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.815
I need you to cosign for my motorcycle.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.751
What motorcycle? I'm
buying a motorcycle.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.153
Shane, you have no money.

04:14.154 --> 04:17.154
Why in the world would you be buying
a motorcycle that you can't afford?

04:17.923 --> 04:20.459
Dave, you're white. You
can't understand this.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.726
This is something different.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.929
Don't play the race
card with me, Froot Loop.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.664
I'll take him in. You
stay with Kevin, okay?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.333
Okay. All right, go ahead.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.101
Have fun, champ. Go get 'em, buddy.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.102
You should see this thing. It's
awesome. Even Trudy loves it.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.407
Who's Trudy?

04:35.408 --> 04:36.842
That's my girlfriend.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.977
Girl from the mall?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.645
She's 20 years old, Dave.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.514
Let's go. Let's move
it. I got bikes to move.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.516
Listen, Shane. You are not buying

04:43.517 --> 04:46.085
some 20-year-old
broad a motorcycle.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.920
I'm not buying her
anything, it's for me!

04:47.921 --> 04:50.921
Daddy, what's taking so long?

04:51.258 --> 04:52.691
Hey, baby, I'm on the phone,

04:52.692 --> 04:55.692
and I would prefer it if you
didn't call me that in public.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.596
But I call all my boyfriends Daddy!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.372
Dave, you gotta do this for me.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.640
Why don't you just lease it?

05:07.641 --> 05:08.874
No, she'll know.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.843
Who will know? She's a kid.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.211
Buy her a Hello Kitty book.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.380
Get her an assignment notebook
and put rainbow stickers in it.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.714
You don't have to buy her a motorcycle.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.017
Did you or did you not say, "Move on"?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.518
I told you to try to work it out.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.720
Joey's the one who told you to move on.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.222
Can you give me a minute?

05:23.223 --> 05:26.223
Try to make it fast, Daddy.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.697
Dave, I'm hurting. I would
love for my wife to come back.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.670
But we know that's not gonna happen.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.406
It's nice to feel appreciated.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.407
I need this for me.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.744
Fine. Just text me the address. Okay?

05:48.748 --> 05:50.249
Pick out a helmet, baby!

05:50.250 --> 05:52.585
Daddy!

05:52.586 --> 05:53.752
So, honey, this is the tile.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.088
It's all gonna happen at once
and I really need you to dial in.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.256
Sweetheart, I'll help you.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.557
I want a sugar cone.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.392
I'm gonna hit you
after this, buddy. Okay.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.594
Honey, you work from 8:00 to 8:00.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.828
You're not gonna be helping anyone.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.096
Hang on, honey, okay?

06:04.097 --> 06:05.231
It's just really busy right now

06:05.232 --> 06:06.732
because the video game ships this month.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.434
Now that I have you, I
just want you to dial in

06:08.435 --> 06:09.935
and tell me what you really think.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.070
It's fine.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.171
Do you love it?

06:12.172 --> 06:14.039
As much as I can love
tile, I love this tile.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.442
Okay, good, 'cause it's $1,000.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.943
Really? Mmm-hmm.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.111
Is that installed?

06:19.112 --> 06:20.412
Nope, just the tile.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.615
Well, what is it made
out of? Whale tusks?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.116
No, it's not made out of whale tusks.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.885
This is so boring.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.286
Give me just one second.
Let me just grab this.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.387
Honey? We have to do this today. Hello?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.955
Hello, Dave. Joey?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.223
Yeah, hey. Look... Just
one second, that's it.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.424
...what are you doing
about the Jason thing?

06:32.425 --> 06:34.193
If it's Joey, can you ask him
if he's coming to the party?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.061
Are you... Are you coming
to the party on Sunday?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.129
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.264
Yeah, he's coming, all right?

06:38.265 --> 06:39.465
Give me one second. Stay with Mom.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.599
One second.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.401
Jason's gonna be calling you, all right?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.304
He's got another one of
his PowerPoint deals that...

06:45.305 --> 06:47.773
Hold on one second. Hello?

06:47.774 --> 06:49.441
Hey, Dave, it's Jason.

06:49.442 --> 06:52.442
Listen, I'd love to put something
on the books with you and Ronnie.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.880
Are you gonna make it to
Kevin's birthday on Sunday?

06:54.881 --> 06:57.483
Yes, I am. Now, listen,
I was hoping that

06:57.484 --> 06:59.151
you guys would come
down here to the firm

06:59.152 --> 07:01.553
because Cynthia and I have
a PowerPoint presentation

07:01.554 --> 07:04.056
that would just play gangbusters
in the conference room.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.057
Okay, okay, hold on one
second. It's ringing.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.627
Hello? Why'd you hang up on me?

07:08.628 --> 07:10.129
I didn't hang up on you. You're on hold.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.398
He's trying to get me to see
another one of his PowerPoint things.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.499
That stuff creeps me out.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.600
It's just how he communicates.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.968
He's... He's, you know...
He's overly efficient.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.469
Well, I don't like
hearing about ball cancer,

07:17.470 --> 07:19.071
let alone looking at diagrams.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.172
Joey, he was scared.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.307
Tell him I'm not going.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.474
I ain't telling him you're not going.

07:22.475 --> 07:23.509
You know, I got him on the other line.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.643
You can tell him yourself. Hold on.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.178
I don't want to... I don't...

07:26.179 --> 07:27.313
Hello, Jason?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.348
Yeah. I got Joey on the line.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.350
Hey, Joey, I've left you

07:31.351 --> 07:33.519
a bunch of voice mail messages
all morning. Where are you?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.987
Listen, I can't make it.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.022
Well, we haven't even
set a time yet, you know.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.524
If you'd listened to the voice mail,

07:38.525 --> 07:40.459
you'd know that this
is just a feeler call

07:40.460 --> 07:41.694
to check your temperature on schedule.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.695
I'm not sitting through another
slide show about ball cancer.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.533
Listen, pal, I'm alive today because
of early detection, all right?

07:47.534 --> 07:48.634
Is this about ball cancer?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.969
"Cause I..
- I'm not into that, either.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.203
I'm gonna wrap this up right now.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.874
and if you two refuse to check
your scrotums for hardened nodules,

07:55.875 --> 07:57.209
I certainly can't force you, can l?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.712
Look, I gotta go, all right? Bye+

07:59.713 --> 08:02.713
Dave, are you still there? Hello, Dave?

08:03.883 --> 08:06.051
Kevin! Kevin, that's not a real toilet!

08:06.052 --> 08:08.053
Sweetheart, he's pissing in
the middle of the whole thing!

08:08.054 --> 08:09.188
Buddy, I gotta go.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.857
But Cynthia and I are willing to
offer you a life-changing opportunity.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.826
Jason, you don't understand.
My son is literally peeing

08:13.827 --> 08:15.694
right in the middle of the
store. I gotta go. Go, go, go.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.062
Okay, but that's not
a real toilet there.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.964
It looks like a real toilet to me.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.965
Yeah, it looks real. Okay.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.502
That's a whole other conversation.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.870
You feel better? Yep.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.839
Okay, let's button those up.
You want me to get those for you?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.840
Yep.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.679
There's not a lot to
say. Sorry about that.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.594
Mom, Dad's home.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.728
Hi, hon.

08:49.729 --> 08:52.097
Hey, how was your day?

08:52.098 --> 08:53.932
Usual. Yours?

08:53.933 --> 08:55.934
Good.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.003
Okay, love you. Bye.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.938
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait
a second, wait a second.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.940
You're going out? Yeah, I'm going out.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.776
What are... What are you wearing?

09:03.777 --> 09:04.943
Shorts. Shorts?

09:04.944 --> 09:06.745
That's... That's a Maxi Pad.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.746
Dad, they're designer shorts.
They're French. Goodbye.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.617
Could you just come over
here? Sit down for a second.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.085
I don't have time for this.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.953
Come here. Sit down. No, I'm...

09:14.954 --> 09:16.121
I'm late and they're waiting for me.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.222
I know,

09:17.223 --> 09:20.059
but you still live in my house
for another few months, okay?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.693
Yeah, I know. Now when
you dress like that,

09:21.694 --> 09:23.529
you send signals.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.797
You know what kind of
guy you attract like that?

09:24.798 --> 09:25.964
You attract the guy with the...

09:25.965 --> 09:27.566
With his pants around
his ass at the mall.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.234
No, I don't! Yes, you do.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.470
Sweetheart, he is right.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.472
Lacey, I'm saying you're beautiful.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.374
You're smart. You're a good person.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.276
You just got accepted into Stanford.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.444
We're so proud of you.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.946
I'm just saying know your value, okay?

09:40.947 --> 09:43.782
And if a guy doesn't see
that, he doesn't deserve you.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.783
No, and you don't want to
be with those guys, honey.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.589
Okay, then I'll go change.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.590
Thank you.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.962
And could you change the
pictures on your Facebook page?

09:56.963 --> 09:57.996
Dad.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.131
It's just 'cause we love you.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.466
Love me less.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.568
I don't want any bikini
pictures on the Internet!

10:02.569 --> 10:04.736
When you're living in my
house, you're a Taliban!

10:04.737 --> 10:06.271
Okay? You keep your body a secret.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.272
Except you get to, you know,
go to school and read books.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.280
Did you send the tuition check?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.682
You said you were going to.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.084
Please. Don't start this again.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.086
Yeah, I didn't start with
it. You just brought it up.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.454
You're supposed to send the check.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.522
You said you were gonna do it.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.357
You never do anything
you say you're gonna do.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.358
Eighteen years. Just try to hold it
together for another couple months.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.461
Trust me, I'm counting the days.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.533
Do that hurt, Daddy,
or do that feel good?

10:37.337 --> 10:40.337
It's both. It hurt and it feel good.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.208
Bang, bang.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.380
Did you put in the wide beauty shots?

10:48.381 --> 10:49.515
Yeah.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.616
Are you sure?

10:50.617 --> 10:51.850
Why would you ask me that?

10:51.851 --> 10:53.152
You know I triple-check everything.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.153
Yeah, no, I know. It's just,
you know, super-important, okay?

10:56.456 --> 10:57.823
We only get one shot at it.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.726
It'd just be nice if you could
show me a little bit of trust.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.727
I do. Come on, I do, I do. I just
want this to be perfect, that's all.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.565
It's not about trust. Come on.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.566
I want it to be perfect, too.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.569
Good.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.820
How old is she?

11:28.821 --> 11:31.423
I think she's 20. He
met her at the mall.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.559
She was working at Foot Locker.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.561
He was so in love with Jennifer.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.496
I am shocked he met someone so quickly.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.497
I know. I was hoping they
were just taking a break.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.402
I haven't even heard from
her since they split up.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.403
I think he got us in the
divorce. You want more wine?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.509
Cynthia, it's time. We're
all set up in the bedroom.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.610
Great. Ladies?

11:51.611 --> 11:52.878
You're kidding, right? No, it's easy.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.746
We brought our own screen.

11:54.747 --> 11:55.914
You can't do it right now.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.616
We're in the middle of
my son's birthday party.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.617
It won't take long and I know
you"re gonna be really excited.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.854
Bring your booze.

12:02.855 --> 12:05.290
Okay, then.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.392
We're taking the wine.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.393
Watch this, guys. Watch.
This is a really spooky ball.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.968
Just, could you please put
the ball cancer video on?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.135
I'm trying, Joey.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.471
Please. I don't want to
watch that ball cancer video.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.539
Where's Trudy?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.541
Oh, she's watching the magician.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.309
Well, there it is. Okay.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.310
This is not a video and it
is not about ball cancer.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.147
Thank God. That,s a first.

12:29.148 --> 12:32.148
Jason and I are seriously
considering getting a divorce.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.557
Okay? So, it's no secret

12:41.728 --> 12:44.096
that Cynthia and I have had our problems

12:44.097 --> 12:46.798
trying to conceive
over the last 12 months.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.166
That's no reason to get a divorce.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.268
No.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.669
We know. Of course not.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.670
But suffice it to say, it's been
more than taxing on both of us,

12:56.843 --> 12:59.843
and it's forced us to question
our entire relationship.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.347
You two are perfect for each other.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.316
We're just not so sure
about that anymore.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.151
We're not in a good place.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.152
Now, this is not a decision
that we're taking lightly.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.325
Cynthia and I have been
together for eight long years.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.593
And if it's not meant to be,

13:14.594 --> 13:17.594
we just don't want to waste
any more of each other's time.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.864
Yeah. Because, if we do get divorced,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.368
it will take at least six months

13:23.369 --> 13:26.271
to go through the five stages of grief.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.372
For the sake of argument,

13:27.373 --> 13:30.373
let's optimistically assume it takes
six months to find compatible mates.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.012
Tack on another 12 months for courtship,

13:34.013 --> 13:36.548
an additional six months
for attempting procreation...

13:36.549 --> 13:38.283
You can see how this starts to stack up.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.284
Sounds like you guys are really
working from the heart on this one.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.487
Well, we're lost, Dave,

13:42.488 --> 13:44.856
and so what we need to do is we
need to take the next two weeks

13:44.857 --> 13:47.225
and we need to find out whether
we're gonna push forward,

13:47.226 --> 13:48.860
or whether we're gonna fold up shop.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.861
And that is why we are going to go here.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.301
You're on, Cyn.

13:56.302 --> 13:59.302
Welcome to Eden. Okay? The
ultimate playground for couples.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.407
It's got fun, it's got sun.
It's Disneyland for adults.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.013
Wow. That is amazing.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.082
Yeah, you guys are gonna have a blast.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.751
Actually, we have found
a great group rate.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.686
Oh, there's the fine print.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.755
No, now... Now, Joey, you know, just...

14:16.756 --> 14:18.223
The embarrassing fact is that, you know,

14:18.224 --> 14:21.224
Cynthia and I can't afford to
go to this place by ourselves,

14:21.828 --> 14:24.828
but if all of us go
together, it's half-price.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.999
It's called the Pelican Package.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Okay? It's six nights, seven
days and it's all inclusive.

14:31.037 --> 14:34.037
And there are quite a few
activities you can choose from.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.441
Who here likes to eat?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.943
I know you guys do. I sure do.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.177
Right? Boom!

14:39.178 --> 14:42.178
Why not do it at a
four-star restaurant?

14:42.281 --> 14:44.716
You guys, it has a
state-of-the-art spa.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.251
Ah. Mmm-hmm.

14:46.252 --> 14:49.054
They've got your kayaking,
they've got your windsurfing,

14:49.055 --> 14:50.122
they've got your canoeing,

14:50.123 --> 14:51.890
they've got your jet skiing. Wow.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.726
It's got Couples Skill
Building and snorkeling...

14:54.727 --> 14:56.361
Who, whoa, whoa. Back up.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.529
What was that last thing?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.630
Snorkeling?

14:58.631 --> 15:01.032
No, no. Before snorkeling
and after jet skiing,

15:01.033 --> 15:03.635
you said, "Couples Skill Building."

15:03.636 --> 15:05.237
That sounds like therapy to me.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.471
See, that's gonna be a problem.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.973
We don't believe in therapy. No.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.608
Hell to the no.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.143
Then you don't have to do it.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.145
That's the great thing about
the Pelican Package, you guys.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.080
It really includes everything.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.082
Obviously, Jason and I want to partake

15:17.083 --> 15:18.717
in the Couples Skill Building,

15:18.718 --> 15:20.485
but you guys can just do the fun stuff.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.987
So what are we asking?

15:21.988 --> 15:24.289
We're asking for you
guys to fly to paradise

15:24.290 --> 15:26.792
and have an awesome time, okay?

15:26.793 --> 15:29.394
I mean, this... Come
on, it would be a blast.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.829
Jason, I got a job,

15:30.830 --> 15:33.830
and with everything that's going on with
the house and with the kids right now,

15:34.333 --> 15:36.301
it would be impossible
for us to leave them.

15:36.302 --> 15:37.402
Yeah, we can't.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.403
When was the last time you
two took a vacation? Hmm?

15:42.842 --> 15:45.811
I mean, don't you want to go
to this island and have fun,

15:45.812 --> 15:47.846
together, as a couple?

15:47.847 --> 15:49.614
What kind of question is that?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.849
That's like asking Richard Simmons,

15:50.850 --> 15:53.418
would he rather stuff his face
or skip around to the oldies.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.187
Of course he'd rather stuff
his face, but he can't,

15:55.188 --> 15:56.955
'cause he's... He's got
to stay thin so he can...

15:56.956 --> 15:59.491
So he can get up and do his
thing and... And make videos.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.027
Maybe he needs the money. Maybe
he's got a gambling problem!

16:02.028 --> 16:03.762
I don't know what goes
on in that dude's head!

16:03.763 --> 16:05.864
And I'd love to go to that
island, but I can't, either.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.865
Not 'cause I got to make videos like
Rich, but I got other obligations.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.368
Listen, I can really appreciate
the situation that you guys are in.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.105
Right, well, we need
to know by midnight.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.477
We've been on the wait list forever

16:18.478 --> 16:20.712
and these slots just opened up.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.214
We'd need to leave next week.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.381
Next week?

16:23.382 --> 16:24.549
That's right.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.451
What happened to spontaneity?
What happened to fun?

16:26.452 --> 16:28.553
I don't know. Why don't we
have a PowerPoint presentation

16:28.554 --> 16:30.889
on spontaneity and fun
and figure that one out?

16:30.890 --> 16:33.890
Look, Cynthia and I
need this trip, okay?

16:34.160 --> 16:37.160
I mean, really. You
know, the problem is,

16:37.163 --> 16:39.831
you know, we've stopped having fun

16:39.832 --> 16:42.832
and we're not even sure we
know how to anymore, okay?

16:42.902 --> 16:45.804
So, what we need to find out
is can we get back to the place

16:45.805 --> 16:47.372
where we really enjoy
each other, you know?

16:47.373 --> 16:50.373
Can we get back to the place
of, you know, being in love?

17:04.589 --> 17:07.224
Cynthia's IM-ing me.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.426
Jason was IM-ing me all night.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.429
What'd you tell him?

17:11.430 --> 17:14.430
I logged off.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.666
The place did look beautiful.
You know what it made me think?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.037
It'd kind of be like we got
to take our honeymoon, finally.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.875
God, yeah.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.876
That'd be great.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.115
Really?

17:30.116 --> 17:31.783
Yeah.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.784
Don't you think? I mean, I don't
know, maybe it's a girl thing.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.288
When you're a little girl,

17:36.289 --> 17:39.289
you dream about your
wedding and your honeymoon...

17:41.594 --> 17:43.194
You know.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.230
I was pretty lucky to
get that job right away.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.365
Yeah, of course.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.601
I mean, I can't even imagine...

17:49.602 --> 17:52.602
Living in your dad's
basement any longer? No.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.976
It's funny how time goes so fast.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.811
That doesn't seem that long ago.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.246
No.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.582
Seems like we just had so much going on

18:03.583 --> 18:06.583
and we have ever since,

18:08.788 --> 18:10.121
but maybe the thing to do is just really

18:10.122 --> 18:12.057
buckle down over these next six months

18:12.058 --> 18:15.058
and then when we come up
for air, we'll go somewhere.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.596
That sounds like a plan.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.109
Dave? Did you hear that?

18:33.479 --> 18:36.181
Go back to bed, honey.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.652
What's going on?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.253
I think there's someone outside.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.756
Okay, I'll check it out.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.669
Honey, be careful.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.026
Freeze! Do not move!

19:21.027 --> 19:24.027
Hey, don't... No, it's me, it's
me, it's me! It's me! It's Jason!

19:24.497 --> 19:25.563
What's going on?

19:25.564 --> 19:26.898
It's fine, honey, it's Jason.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.033
Hello!

19:28.034 --> 19:29.200
Why didn't you call?

19:29.201 --> 19:31.302
Didn't want to wake you up.
Sorry, blew that. Back to bed.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.371
Are you crazy? I could've
blown your head off!

19:33.372 --> 19:35.907
What does that say about you, huh?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.908
Rapists don't gently toss
pebbles at the window, Dave.

19:39.311 --> 19:42.311
Wait, can you let me figure it out,
please? There's too much going on.

19:42.581 --> 19:43.715
Turn it off!

19:43.716 --> 19:45.917
It costs money every
time this thing goes off.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.020
Hello? Yeah, everything's
fine. I'm sorry.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.159
The password is
"ass-tastic." That's right.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.160
"Ass-tastic." One word.
"Ass-tastic." "Ass-tastic." It's...

19:59.365 --> 20:02.365
A-S-S-T-A-S-T-I-C.
Okay? Ass-tastic.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.603
That's right, it's... Okay.
Yeah. No, thank you. We're fine.

20:09.108 --> 20:12.108
l... Yes, thank you.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.946
Didn't want to go with the pet's name?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.114
What are you doing here, dude?

20:16.115 --> 20:19.050
What do you think I'm doing here?

20:19.051 --> 20:22.051
Jas, you're showing up to my
house in the middle of the night.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.056
Dave. You're breaking and
entering. You're on tilt.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.291
Yeah, I know, I'm losing my mind.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.292
This... The whole fertility doctor
thing is just an absolute disaster.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.698
We don't communicate anymore.
We're fighting all the time.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.133
We... The only time we have sex is,

20:35.134 --> 20:36.468
you know, when she's ovulating,

20:36.469 --> 20:39.037
and even then, it's
cold. It's emotionless.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.705
It's... I don't know.

20:40.706 --> 20:41.806
Like an oil derrick.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.808
We used to be very,
very spontaneous at that.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.044
Now, it's... I don,t know.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.613
Twice a week, tops.

20:48.614 --> 20:49.948
That's a lot.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.050
Is it? How often do you do it?

20:52.051 --> 20:54.953
It's different now, 'cause
we got the kids, so...

20:54.954 --> 20:56.154
So?

20:56.155 --> 20:58.156
Well, my son falls
asleep in the bed with us.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.491
That shouldn't stop you.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.825
That's disgusting.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.427
I'm not saying he
should tickle your balls.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.062
Just move him into his
room when he falls asleep.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.664
Jason. I can really appreciate
what you're going through,

21:06.665 --> 21:09.167
but, man, this couldn't
come at a worse time.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.568
There's just no way
that we can pull away

21:10.569 --> 21:11.936
from everything and go right now.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.739
I'm sorry, but there's just
no way we can go on the trip.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.740
I'm just scared, you know. Just scared.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.912
You know, my whole life,
everything I've known about it

21:20.913 --> 21:22.413
for the last eight years might be over,

21:22.414 --> 21:24.582
and, you know, I'm
prepared to face that,

21:24.583 --> 21:25.917
you know, if it,s for the best.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.918
If, you know... If it's not
there anymore, then, you know,

21:29.455 --> 21:31.189
I'll face it. I don't
want to do that alone.

21:31.190 --> 21:34.190
And I know that Cynthia
doesn't want to do that alone.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.362
You know, we'd just... We'd
love to have our friends there.

21:37.363 --> 21:40.165
You know that if you go,
everyone else will go.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.166
And I have never asked you for anything.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.702
But I am asking you for this, Dave.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.674
Daddy?

21:49.675 --> 21:52.675
Hey, guys, the alarm
was just an accident.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.380
You can go back to bed.
It's just Uncle Jason.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.016
Okay, guys. It's fine. Let
me take you back to bed.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.017
We want you to go on your trip.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.221
We heard you talking at the party

22:03.222 --> 22:05.890
and you said you
couldn't go because of us.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.525
We don't want you guys to get a divorce.

22:07.526 --> 22:08.726
What?

22:08.727 --> 22:11.229
What are you talking about,
honey? We're not getting a divorce.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.531
But we just want you to be happy.

22:13.532 --> 22:15.300
Guys, we are happy.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.569
We're very happy, honey.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.570
Were you guys listening to
Uncle Jason's slide show?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.409
Thank you, buddy. That's great.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.011
That was adult time.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.247
And why do you think they
were listening, Jason?

22:29.248 --> 22:31.015
I'm sorry about that.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.016
We want you to go, so we called
Grandpa to come take care of us.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.021
You called Grandpa?

22:37.022 --> 22:39.924
You called him tonight?
It's a three-hour drive.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.026
Grandpa's coming to babysit us.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.395
Is Grandpa driving down here now?

22:46.198 --> 22:49.198
Yay! Grandpa Jim Jim's here!

22:49.602 --> 22:51.603
You know, this has
gotten way out of hand.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.239
I'm sorry. I just... I wanted five
minutes of your time. I'm so sorry.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.573
You got... You got kids, you got guns,

22:55.574 --> 22:56.841
you got grandpas that, you know...

22:56.842 --> 22:59.842
You got to explain infertility
and divorce and all that,

23:00.346 --> 23:01.679
and so you got a lot of
parenting to do tonight.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.015
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna
let myself out right here.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.450
I will, however, take the fact that

23:05.451 --> 23:08.451
Grandpa Jim Jim's at the front
door as a firm, tentative yes.

23:09.955 --> 23:12.457
Pack lots of shorts.
It's really hot there.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.458
You're gonna sweat your
bag off. Night-night, kids!

23:48.227 --> 23:49.494
Hi. Welcome.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.329
Thank you.

23:51.330 --> 23:54.330
This place is beautiful.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.833
Look. Hi, hello.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.670
Holy shit, this looks like
a screen saver! Thanks.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.139
Seems like he might be kind
of the guy. Come on, gang.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.841
Hi, we are the Smith
party. Party of eight.

24:03.842 --> 24:04.976
Eight for Smith.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.077
Jason Smith?

24:06.078 --> 24:07.178
That's me.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.781
Welcome to Eden.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.782
My name is Sctanley. Spelled with a "C".

24:13.485 --> 24:16.485
I will be escorting you
to the Eden West resort.

24:16.588 --> 24:19.190
Please, step aboard our shuttle.

24:19.191 --> 24:22.191
No need to take your bags. They will
be waiting for you in your villas.

24:37.009 --> 24:40.009
Excuse me. Sorry. Is this the
shuttle for the Eden resort?

24:41.647 --> 24:43.014
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the shuttle.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.383
Raq, she's still a little
buzzed from the flight.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.052
Man, totally. Me, too. I
don't even know what I'm doing.

24:48.053 --> 24:50.722
Excuse me. What name are your
reservations booked under?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.523
The San Diego Dance Academy.

24:52.524 --> 24:53.658
Wow.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.293
Ah. You ladies are actually travelling

24:55.294 --> 24:57.628
on this shuttle, to Eden East.

24:57.629 --> 25:00.331
Bummer. Bye.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.300
See you. Bye.

25:02.301 --> 25:05.301
Bye.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.138
Would you care to join your wife?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.406
Let's do it. Shall we?

25:08.407 --> 25:09.741
Are they going some place else?

25:09.742 --> 25:12.742
Eden East. It is an
entirely different resort.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.430
It's beautiful.

25:32.431 --> 25:33.698
And the luggage is
already in there, huh?

25:33.699 --> 25:35.099
Yeah. This is yours.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.267
Unbelievable.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.535
The 101.
- Wow.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.370
And we can jump right
out into this here?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.105
You can do whatever you like.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.240
Wow.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.043
Look at the water.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.277
Please. Thank you.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.614
Wow. Wow.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.682
I'm gonna check the bedroom. Okay, baby.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.684
Look at this, baby.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.019
Oh, my God. Look at this.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.354
Welcome to your villa.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.622
It keeps getting better, huh?

25:57.623 --> 26:00.191
It's like a little love hut.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.292
Wow.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.293
This is insane!

26:04.296 --> 26:07.296
Honey, they got fish that you
can see here through the floor!

26:07.633 --> 26:10.201
Baby, they got a hole
where you can see the fish!

26:10.202 --> 26:13.202
Yeah, they got fish in here, too, baby!

26:13.639 --> 26:15.640
Jason, this is dreamy.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.975
Baby, you can jump right
in the ocean on this thing,

26:17.976 --> 26:19.444
and they got a hot tub on the deck!

26:19.445 --> 26:21.946
They got the ocean and
they got the hot tub!

26:21.947 --> 26:23.815
You can dive in the ocean
and you got a hot tub!

26:23.816 --> 26:26.651
Yeah, they got a hot tub in here, too!

26:28.053 --> 26:30.888
Oh, my God. Yo, I gotta
take a picture of this.

26:30.889 --> 26:32.924
Did I tell you? Did
I deliver? Oh, my God.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.892
She ain't never seen nothing like this.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.094
I roll like this! Shit, yeah!

26:36.095 --> 26:37.595
I'm glad you like, sir.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.331
I be rolling like this.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.633
So what goes on over
there? I hear there's music.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.902
Is a party for single
woman and men, sir.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.671
Yes. How do l get over there?

26:46.672 --> 26:48.573
No, you cannot. You can
take the boat if you want,

26:48.574 --> 26:50.508
but not for you. Okay,
when's the boat? Not for me.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.243
No, because you got married here,

26:52.244 --> 26:55.079
the west coast to Eden Resort
so that's why you must keep here.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.148
I don't understand what you're
saying. You sound like Chewbacca.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.683
Well, my instinct is
to stay married to her,

26:58.684 --> 27:00.151
but what do you think I should do?

27:00.152 --> 27:02.787
I mean, do you get a good vibe
from us or not-so-good vibe?

27:02.788 --> 27:03.855
I don't know, sir.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.523
What about this room, in particular?

27:05.524 --> 27:07.091
You've checked a lot
of people into this room

27:07.092 --> 27:08.593
and checked a lot of people out.

27:08.594 --> 27:11.594
Do they usually leave
happier or less happy?

27:11.697 --> 27:13.097
I really don't know, sir.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.665
How do I get over to the party?

27:14.666 --> 27:15.700
By boat or by taxi boat.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.201
Okay. I'd like to arrange
a boat or a taxi boat.

27:17.202 --> 27:18.436
No, it's not possible for you.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.770
Must to stay here with your wife.

27:19.771 --> 27:20.972
Okay, so how do I...

27:20.973 --> 27:22.540
Fish!

27:22.541 --> 27:23.875
Hello.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.877
Where's the television? The main house.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.879
There's no TV in the
room? No, not possible.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.313
But it's the playoffs.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.515
As an alternative to television,

27:30.516 --> 27:33.451
might I recommend a stroll
to the hidden waterfall?

27:33.452 --> 27:35.219
Might you recommend
putting honey in my ears

27:35.220 --> 27:36.654
and having me fall asleep on an anthill?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.489
It's the playoffs.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.490
Honey, the waterfall sounds
amazing. A little romance.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.527
You'll find that the Eden program
creates a palace of solitude,

27:45.564 --> 27:47.398
if you just give yourself over to it.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.733
How's the cell service here?

27:48.734 --> 27:51.734
Monsieur Marcel believes that
technology is a distraction.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.172
Well, how about tipping,
would that be a distraction?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.506
I'm kidding you.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.075
Tipping is not permitted,
nor is money of any kind.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.411
Everything here in Eden is free.

28:00.412 --> 28:01.546
Really?

28:01.547 --> 28:04.547
We do, however, accept smiles.

28:13.091 --> 28:14.592
Did you guys hear what
they have in the spa?

28:14.593 --> 28:15.726
With the snow?

28:15.727 --> 28:18.727
Did you know that they have a
steam, a rain, and a snow room here?

28:18.897 --> 28:20.598
It's a new European spa.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.999
What's a wahoo?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.569
It's a fish.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.237
I don't eat fish.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.039
It's out of this world.
They catch it right here.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.840
I used to work at Red Lobster,

28:29.841 --> 28:32.841
so I know what they do with
them fish in the kitchen.

28:33.011 --> 28:35.780
But, baby, this is not like the Red
Lobster. It's a four-star restaurant.

28:35.781 --> 28:38.216
I don't give a shit! It's
still Mexicans cooking that shit

28:38.217 --> 28:40.451
and I know what they do to it!

28:40.452 --> 28:43.452
I'm one-twelfth Latina, and
even if I wasn't, I'm 100% human,

28:44.690 --> 28:46.457
so I don't appreciate
comments like that.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.960
I don't make fun of tu
la raza, so porfavor,

28:48.961 --> 28:51.462
please, don't make fun of mi la raza-

28:51.463 --> 28:54.463
Oh, I'm sorry, boo. I
didn't mean no disrespect.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.866
Yo, I was with mad Mexicans
before Shane, anyway.

29:01.139 --> 29:04.139
Good evening. I trust
you're all settled in.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.910
Hey, my main man!

29:05.911 --> 29:07.411
Are you in the mood
to accept some smiles?

29:07.412 --> 29:08.713
"Cause this spread is phenomenal.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.715
Why don't you join us for a
drink? You want to pull up a chair?

29:10.716 --> 29:11.816
We'll order some shots.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.985
You might want to go easy on
those. You have an early morning.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.152
Quite the contrary.

29:15.153 --> 29:16.454
I don't have an early morning,

29:16.455 --> 29:18.823
'cause I tell you what's
gonna go down tonight.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.792
I am going to get just
a little bit tipsy.

29:21.793 --> 29:24.793
And then I'm gonna go ahead and
stuff my face on the Seafood Tower,

29:26.098 --> 29:28.065
and I plan on shutting
it down in a big way.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.902
l, if everything goes
well, will be in my room,

29:31.903 --> 29:34.639
passed out on my face, come lunch-ski.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.108
Well, I'm afraid that
isn't going to be possible.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.577
I'm here to present
you with your itinerary.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.646
Fantastic. You guys hear that?

29:41.647 --> 29:43.681
This is a hard copy thing, too.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.016
This is not like... This isn't like

29:45.017 --> 29:46.350
a piece of paper with an itinerary.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.818
No. This is like a book.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.819
Thanks. And the journey begins.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.795
Couples Skill Building at 6:00 a.m.?

30:00.766 --> 30:02.867
Yeah, see, I was
planning on sleeping in,

30:02.868 --> 30:04.969
and then maybe hitting the jet skis.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.872
That is not part of your immediate
program here at Eden West.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.874
But it was in the slide show. Uh-huh.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.677
That would be more
appropriate at the Eden East.

30:12.678 --> 30:13.711
What's Eden East?

30:13.712 --> 30:15.012
The singles' resort.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.714
Singles" resort?

30:16.715 --> 30:19.483
Here at the Eden West, our
focus is on renewing bonds

30:19.484 --> 30:22.053
and nurturing neglected partnerships.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.888
And what's your focus over there?

30:23.889 --> 30:26.889
Sex, mostly.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.492
Freeing inhibitions.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.627
I'm sure if we play our cards right'

30:29.628 --> 30:30.995
we'll be having plenty
of sex here on our side.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.864
Am I wrong, gang?

30:33.865 --> 30:36.865
I spent three years of
therapy with Jennifer,

30:37.235 --> 30:39.804
talking about our
feelings and our problems,

30:39.805 --> 30:41.505
trying to hold onto our marriage.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.741
The last thing I want to do is talk.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.810
Look, I think there's been
a misunderstanding here.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.912
See, we signed up for the fun stuff,

30:47.913 --> 30:50.014
with the touchy-feely
shit being optional.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.148
Thank you.

30:51.149 --> 30:52.416
I think it's called the Pelican Package.

30:52.417 --> 30:54.085
Yes, the Pelican Package,

30:54.086 --> 30:57.021
which is monsieur
Marcel's signature course.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.155
Great.

30:58.156 --> 31:01.156
A healthy combination of
couple-friendly activities,

31:01.159 --> 31:02.827
ample down time... That's the one.

31:02.828 --> 31:05.563
...sprinkled in with some
Couples Skill Building courses,

31:05.564 --> 31:07.832
designed to reignite the dimming flames

31:07.833 --> 31:10.768
of even the most
mismanaged relationships.

31:10.769 --> 31:13.769
Okay, see, these relationships
are not mismanaged.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.406
Well, thank you, Dave. Yes.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.775
Yeah. I'm just saying
we're here to have some fun,

31:17.776 --> 31:19.844
so we are excited about
the couples' activities,

31:19.845 --> 31:21.078
as well as some down time.

31:21.079 --> 31:24.079
It's the flame-lighting thing
that does not have us inspired.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.851
That's more suited for
this particular couple here.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.286
I don't think you're
quite understanding me.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.756
Monsieur Marcel's Pelican Package

31:31.757 --> 31:34.757
is not a fast-food restaurant wherein

31:34.960 --> 31:37.895
you pick what you want from a menu.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.398
Monsieur Marcel is the
single most-recognized

31:40.399 --> 31:43.399
couples whisperer in the entire world.

31:43.468 --> 31:44.735
Couple whisperer?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.638
He has studied
psychology, yoga, tai chi,

31:47.639 --> 31:50.639
The Art of War, and combined
them to form this place, Eden.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.912
The Mecca for couples. Mmm.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.882
He has designed a program
specifically for you.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.883
You either partake of the
entire meal or have none of it.

32:02.554 --> 32:05.554
I think you're being a little
extreme here, Mr. Belvedere.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.828
We have a very long waiting list.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.563
If there's been some
kind of misunderstanding,

32:12.564 --> 32:15.564
I'd be happy to refund your
money, and you can go on your way.

32:16.334 --> 32:19.334
We will, however, not be
able to refund your airfare.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.338
No, it's just that we were excited

32:21.339 --> 32:23.407
about the sightseeing and the hiking

32:23.408 --> 32:25.443
and the jet skiing and
the snorkeling. It's...

32:25.444 --> 32:26.777
Well, there are plenty of places

32:26.778 --> 32:29.013
that provide those activities.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.415
Perhaps this troupe
might be more comfortable

32:31.416 --> 32:34.416
at a Sandals or a Club Med.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.786
This here is monsieur Marcel's Eden.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.292
Now, if you're not at Couples
Skill Building by 6:00 a.m.,

32:44.329 --> 32:45.863
I'll take that as you want your refund

32:45.864 --> 32:48.864
and will not be completing the program.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.671
Screw him! Where does he get
the ass to run down Sandals?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.007
Sandals rocks.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.476
It's just one little
thing we have to do.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.477
It'll be over in a few hours and
then we have fun the rest of the day.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.881
You know, let's just
not forget why we came.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.149
This is not what we signed up for!

33:05.150 --> 33:06.350
This is not what we signed up for.

33:06.351 --> 33:07.685
I don't remember ever
seeing 'mandatory,"

33:07.686 --> 33:08.953
but, listen, we just go with it.

33:08.954 --> 33:11.954
Now we're on Han's Island about
to do the thing with Bruce Lee.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.658
Guys, guys, I don't think
there's any reason to overreact

33:14.659 --> 33:15.726
right off the bat, okay?

33:15.727 --> 33:16.961
Obviously, the meal is included,

33:16.962 --> 33:18.696
from what he said, so
let's just sit here,

33:18.697 --> 33:21.697
we'll weigh the pros and cons from
a calm place, we'll make a decision.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.902
That was amazing.

33:24.903 --> 33:27.903
Oh, might have been the
best meal I've ever had.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.808
Well, could be a full week of those.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.710
What are you doing? Your last course.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.411
Dessert.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.718
It is so beautiful here. I can't
wait to go see that waterfall.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.719
The weather is perfect, we got huts
on the water, and now I am eating art.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.391
So we give up a little bit of
our day to talk about feelings.

33:47.392 --> 33:50.392
How bad can it really be, right?

34:04.843 --> 34:07.843
Welcome to Eden Resort.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.447
I am Marcel.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.283
Hi. Morning.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.284
I know why you are all here.

34:16.288 --> 34:19.023
You are here to seek the answer

34:19.024 --> 34:22.024
to the most commonly
asked question by all,

34:24.563 --> 34:27.563
how do we make it work?

34:29.734 --> 34:32.734
How?

34:34.306 --> 34:37.306
I have laid out a personalized program

34:39.476 --> 34:42.476
designed to challenge you all,

34:43.114 --> 34:46.114
both as couples and as individuals.

34:49.621 --> 34:52.621
If you follow diligently my program,

34:53.491 --> 34:56.491
the answer to this question
will be revealed to you,

34:56.494 --> 34:59.494
as well as your inner animal spirit.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.999
This I promise.

35:09.174 --> 35:12.174
I do not, however, promise
that you and your chosen partner

35:13.778 --> 35:16.778
will have what it takes to sustain it.

35:22.087 --> 35:25.087
Please, line up on the beach.

35:25.857 --> 35:26.991
Take your places.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.025
Out here?

35:28.026 --> 35:31.026
This way. Men on one
line, facing the ocean.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.796
Women, back to the water.

35:38.036 --> 35:41.036
Now remove your mask.

35:46.711 --> 35:47.811
Undress!

35:47.812 --> 35:49.847
Oh. All right.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.382
It's a freeing exercise.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.683
This is starting to
get a little creepy now.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.219
It'd mean a lot to me if you"d just
take your pants off, all right, Dave?

35:55.220 --> 35:56.320
Is that why you brought me here?

35:56.321 --> 35:59.321
This is... What is this?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.567
You must undress, my friend.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.703
I'm afraid that's not a option
for me today, you know, man.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.805
It's the program.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.074
Right. I don't have any drawers, though.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.410
Well, Sctanley said he had this
conversation with you last night.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.411
Now, if you've chosen to stay,
you've chosen to participate.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.081
Now, if you're not wearing any drawers,

36:24.082 --> 36:27.082
then, hey, that was meant to be.

36:27.419 --> 36:30.419
Let it all hang out.

36:33.091 --> 36:36.091
Explore. Explore with your eyes.

36:37.062 --> 36:40.062
Explore your mate.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.100
We are all made in God's image.

36:43.101 --> 36:45.436
That means we are all perfect.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.437
Stand with pride. Look
closer. Own your bodies.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.776
And now, tell your partner
a truth. A beautiful truth.

36:58.183 --> 36:59.383
You look like the earth.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.418
What?

37:01.419 --> 37:02.519
Why are you listening
to what I'm saying?

37:02.520 --> 37:03.620
Why don't you have
your own conversation?

37:03.621 --> 37:05.889
It's hard to have my own conversation
when you're telling Cynthia

37:05.890 --> 37:06.957
that she looks like the earth.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.125
Did you hear what I said?

37:08.126 --> 37:09.626
Yeah. I'm not really
sure I like that one.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.962
Well, I just mean that, you
know, you look bountiful. Okay?

37:11.963 --> 37:13.797
Fruitful. Fertile.

37:13.798 --> 37:16.100
Okay. Now this is getting uncomfortable.

37:16.101 --> 37:19.101
Please, make a palace of solitude
between you and your partner.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.642
Why are you wearing trousers?

37:27.479 --> 37:29.246
I explained to the guy in the dress

37:29.247 --> 37:31.148
that I didn't have any drawers on.

37:31.149 --> 37:34.149
Yes, but this exercise
is about owning your body.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.386
Mmm.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.455
What is your name, dear?

37:38.456 --> 37:39.723
Trudy.

37:39.724 --> 37:42.724
Trudy. What a beautiful name.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.927
Please, tell him that you love his body.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.000
For real? Yes.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.268
I love your body.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.503
Really?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.938
Of course! So powerful, so strong.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.939
Powerful frame with layer upon
layer of dormant, relaxed muscle,

37:59.410 --> 38:02.410
waiting, like a panther, to
pounce on its quivering prey.

38:05.350 --> 38:08.350
Please, take off his pants. Yes.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.657
I'm not ready to pounce today.

38:13.658 --> 38:14.758
Yes.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.627
I don't have any drawers.
No. No. Right here, baby.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.128
It's okay. It's okay. Hair!

38:18.129 --> 38:20.631
Sorry, I'm sorry. Careful.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.600
Here it comes. Here it comes.

38:25.770 --> 38:28.770
Wonderful! Stare at
it! Stare at all of it.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.340
Is his junk out?

38:30.341 --> 38:31.508
Yep.

38:31.509 --> 38:32.943
Is his junk literally out of his pants?

38:32.944 --> 38:34.111
Yep.

38:34.112 --> 38:37.112
Now it's a party.

38:45.123 --> 38:48.123
How would you describe
your relationship?

38:48.193 --> 38:49.393
Average. Great, yeah.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.161
Great. Average. I mean, yeah.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.162
And, to clarify, what is an
"average, great" relationship?

38:54.332 --> 38:57.332
Well, we... We make it through
things pretty good together.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.136
You know, we have two great kids.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.238
No one's called 911 in
the middle of the night.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.176
Like there's not domestic
violence in the... The... Yeah.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.249
Ronnie, when you say you 'make
it through things together,"

39:12.250 --> 39:13.650
what do you mean?

39:13.651 --> 39:16.651
Well, you know, the
usual stuff. Work, kids.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.356
I'm much less interested
in "the usual stuff"

39:19.357 --> 39:21.525
and much more interested
in your particular stuff.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.526
So, what do you make it
through together, specifically?

39:26.364 --> 39:29.364
Well, right now, specifically,

39:32.070 --> 39:34.571
Dave is dealing with his new launch

39:34.572 --> 39:37.572
of his video game, Guitar Hero.

39:37.775 --> 39:39.376
He sells Guitar Hero.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.377
And I am dealing with the renovations.

39:42.513 --> 39:43.747
That's interesting.

39:43.748 --> 39:44.948
What's interesting?

39:44.949 --> 39:47.718
Why do you keep writing stuff
down on your little pad there?

39:47.719 --> 39:50.719
Oh, I'm taking notes.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.458
Would it make you more
comfortable if I didn't take notes?

39:54.459 --> 39:56.460
Yeah, actually, it would
make me more comfortable.

39:56.461 --> 39:57.561
Thank you.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.562
That's interesting.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.800
So we want to make the most
of our time here on the island,

40:03.801 --> 40:06.270
so what we did was we put together
a little informational packet

40:06.271 --> 40:08.572
to bring you up to speed
on our relationship.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.907
Go ahead. That's for you.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.808
It just contains pertinent medical data,

40:11.809 --> 40:13.710
family histories, you
know, stuff like that.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.711
Everything but a mix tape.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.981
How would you
characterize your marriage?

40:20.151 --> 40:21.985
Perfect.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.888
Fantastic.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.889
Well, let's start with
something easy, then.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.827
What's your favorite
thing about your partner?

40:30.828 --> 40:32.629
Uh...

40:32.630 --> 40:34.097
She's a good mom.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.266
He really is a great dad.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.734
And where did you meet?

40:37.735 --> 40:40.735
School. High school. High school. Yeah.

40:41.306 --> 40:44.306
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team. Fullback.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.743
I coach now, but I used to play.

40:46.744 --> 40:49.744
And we had... We actually
had our daughter... We...

40:51.683 --> 40:54.683
On prom night, we conceived Lacey

40:55.019 --> 40:57.587
and it was a little confusing at
the time, but it's been a blessing.

40:57.588 --> 40:59.022
It's been the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

40:59.023 --> 41:00.424
It's been the best thing
that ever happened to us.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.792
We did the right thing.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.793
How often do you have sex?

41:05.596 --> 41:08.596
She wants me to be
tougher, screw harder.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.536
Work less, but bring home more.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.705
I can't keep this shit straight.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.706
All I know is, whatever I
do, it's not good enough. Mmm.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.678
It's over.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.647
Then why are you here?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.516
This is not my wife. This is
Trudy. I met her a couple weeks ago.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.517
Can we go boogie boarding now?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.855
And once people knew what
we were going through,

41:31.856 --> 41:34.856
I think my cortisol levels
just shot up through the roof.

41:36.794 --> 41:39.029
Because it's difficult to go through

41:39.030 --> 41:42.030
a very private struggle publicly.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.069
I heard what you think,

41:46.070 --> 41:47.738
but you know what I'm
really interested in

41:47.739 --> 41:50.739
is hearing about how you feel.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.410
Just tell her how you feel.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.911
Well, I think if you
looked at everything that...

41:54.912 --> 41:57.912
No, no, no, no. Just... Don't
explain intellectually how you feel.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.349
You know, just tell her
how you feel. In one word.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.220
Sure.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.258
Angry.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.259
Cynthia?

42:12.397 --> 42:13.530
Judged.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.898
Very good.

42:14.899 --> 42:17.267
Yes? Progress.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.368
Excited.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.270
Relieved.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.505
That is it. Yeah.

42:21.506 --> 42:22.606
We're awesome at feelings!

42:22.607 --> 42:25.008
Okay. Nice job today, guys.

42:25.009 --> 42:26.610
That's all for today? Great
job. That's all for today.

42:26.611 --> 42:27.744
All right, well, great. Yeah.

42:27.745 --> 42:29.446
How did we do? Did we do good?

42:29.447 --> 42:30.781
I mean, are we gonna make it?

42:30.782 --> 42:33.250
Well, you know, it's just
our first session, you know.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.919
We're not looking for an end
result here. It's not a competition.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.789
I get all that, but have you seen
couples that are worse off than us?

42:38.790 --> 42:40.624
Yeah. Or are we that far gone?

42:40.625 --> 42:42.626
We're... Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?

42:42.627 --> 42:44.127
You know, Doc? Like a one to 10?

42:44.128 --> 42:45.629
One being worst, 10 being best?

42:45.630 --> 42:47.631
No, hang on one second.
Where would you put us?

42:47.632 --> 42:49.599
Right where you are, sir.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.401
What if someone put a gun to
your head right now and said,

42:51.402 --> 42:53.370
"You have to answer this
second or I'll shoot.

42:53.371 --> 42:55.205
"Are they gonna make
it?" What do you say?

42:55.206 --> 42:56.273
What would you say?

42:56.274 --> 42:59.274
Whoa! Okay, no one has a
gun to my head, Mr. Smith.

42:59.477 --> 43:00.644
It's hypothetical.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.546
It's not a place for
inappropriate behavior.

43:02.547 --> 43:05.449
And you definitely don't pull a
hypothetical gun on your therapist.

43:05.450 --> 43:06.583
Sorry.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.717
It's okay.

43:07.718 --> 43:09.286
Let's clear the karma. Okay?

43:09.287 --> 43:11.154
I'll holster this.

43:11.155 --> 43:12.756
See, you know, I work 10 hours a day,

43:12.757 --> 43:14.257
so by the time I come
home, I'm exhausted.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.893
It's not that I don't want to answer
questions about the house renovation.

43:16.894 --> 43:19.396
I really just don't want to
answer questions about anything.

43:19.397 --> 43:22.232
But, you know, you may just
be shutting your mind off,

43:22.233 --> 43:25.233
but it can feel like you're
shutting your partner off as well.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.504
Again, that's a caution area.

43:27.505 --> 43:29.106
And just as a point of interest,

43:29.107 --> 43:30.674
when you speak that way, David,

43:30.675 --> 43:33.675
you're really
de-prioritizing your teammate.

43:33.678 --> 43:34.811
Excuse me?

43:34.812 --> 43:37.314
It's called "crossing
emotional boundaries."

43:37.315 --> 43:40.315
Or, more commonly,
"bulldozing." And it's ugly.

43:42.854 --> 43:44.855
Ronnie, when you spoke earlier of...

43:44.856 --> 43:47.856
Let me just find it in my notes here.

43:54.198 --> 43:57.198
There it is+ You said, "We make
it through things well together."

43:58.636 --> 44:00.203
That doesn't sound very fun.

44:00.204 --> 44:03.204
You don't want to look back and
say, "I made it through my life."

44:03.875 --> 44:06.875
We want to enjoy our
projects, enjoy our work week.

44:07.378 --> 44:10.378
We want to enjoy our
lives, celebrate our lives.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.182
And all this talk about my project

44:12.183 --> 44:14.718
and his work, and my this and his that,

44:14.719 --> 44:17.487
and mine and his, and
mine and... It,s...

44:17.488 --> 44:19.890
Where's us in all that?

44:19.891 --> 44:22.891
Where is our journey? I don't hear it.

44:22.894 --> 44:25.562
And it's because it's not there.

44:25.563 --> 44:27.564
Listen. I'm not saying that there's not

44:27.565 --> 44:29.466
some really stressful times sometimes,

44:29.467 --> 44:31.501
because there is, but it works for us.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.337
Does it?

44:34.338 --> 44:37.338
I don't know.

44:37.408 --> 44:40.408
Oh, gosh, I don't know, you guys.

44:40.411 --> 44:42.913
There's no "us." There's no "we."

44:42.914 --> 44:45.914
You two could be perfect strangers.

44:46.250 --> 44:49.250
I think the one thing that
we can agree on, today,

44:50.922 --> 44:53.922
is that you guys should be doing
a lot better than just "works."

44:57.161 --> 45:00.161
Pretty sure that's why you're here.

45:00.264 --> 45:03.264
Oh. That's it. Great. Great
job, everybody. Thank you.

45:58.489 --> 46:01.489
Lucy?

46:38.462 --> 46:41.462
Good day, sir. I got room
service for you. I'm very sorry.

46:44.268 --> 46:45.368
I didn't order that.

46:45.369 --> 46:48.369
I think your wife,
she called me for you.

46:48.539 --> 46:51.274
I'm...

46:51.275 --> 46:53.043
This is just... Because I got a sunburn,

46:53.044 --> 46:54.377
'cause it was... The sun
was very strong today.

46:54.378 --> 46:56.112
Yeah. I know. This is
good for sunburns, right?

46:56.113 --> 46:57.213
No. Okay.

46:57.214 --> 46:58.381
It's good, yeah?

46:58.382 --> 46:59.849
It's good for sunburn?

46:59.850 --> 47:01.217
Okay, so I don't see anything.

47:01.218 --> 47:02.519
See what? There's nothing to see.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.720
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. It works great.

47:03.721 --> 47:05.121
Okay, I move now. No. That was.
-. That was...

47:05.122 --> 47:08.122
There's nothing to move.
I... I was... I had a sunburn.

47:10.161 --> 47:13.161
Good night, sir.

47:40.725 --> 47:43.725
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!

47:43.994 --> 47:46.262
See and take in with your eyes

47:46.263 --> 47:49.263
all the beauty the ocean has to offer!

47:50.334 --> 47:52.736
As these new things come at you,

47:52.737 --> 47:55.071
you may not have seen them before,

47:55.072 --> 47:58.072
but be open to them and
find the beauty within.

47:59.443 --> 48:00.577
Hey, buddy. Yep.

48:00.578 --> 48:02.746
Thanks a lot for bringing
me to Problem Island.

48:02.747 --> 48:04.013
What are we gonna do for an encore?

48:04.014 --> 48:06.282
Talk about all the people that we
slept with before we were married

48:06.283 --> 48:07.517
and really stir shit up?

48:07.518 --> 48:08.718
What the hell are you talking about?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.620
The therapist is trying
to create a problem

48:10.621 --> 48:12.288
in my marriage that doesn't exist!

48:12.289 --> 48:14.124
Maybe he's not creating them,
maybe he's just noticing them.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.291
Okay, you know what?
Don't start with me.

48:15.292 --> 48:17.293
I'm serious. I don't need it.
These are the best in the world

48:17.294 --> 48:18.795
at what they do, all right?

48:18.796 --> 48:20.430
If Jeff Gordon told you
that your oil was low,

48:20.431 --> 48:22.132
you might want to
think about changing it.

48:22.133 --> 48:24.134
From the bucket, feed them!

48:24.135 --> 48:25.935
My therapist is kind of pushy.

48:25.936 --> 48:27.036
Really? Yeah.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.471
God, I like ours.

48:28.472 --> 48:31.472
Yeah, he said that Dave and
I take each other for granted.

48:31.809 --> 48:34.809
That, you know, our relationship
has become more like a job.

48:35.813 --> 48:37.046
How do you mean?

48:37.047 --> 48:40.047
For example, he says that
Dave is de-prioritizing me,

48:40.084 --> 48:43.084
that he doesn't pay attention
to what I actually want.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.489
Yeah, but, honey, that's just
Dave being Dave, you know?

48:46.490 --> 48:49.490
Yeah.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.560
But so then, what if Dave
being Dave is sort of like

48:53.964 --> 48:55.832
Dave bulldozing me?

48:55.833 --> 48:58.435
Please continue to look at the fish!

48:58.436 --> 49:01.104
Enjoy them as they come at you!

49:01.105 --> 49:03.440
I get it, dude, it's
advanced snorkeling.

49:03.441 --> 49:06.441
Dave... Hey, I'm trying
to do this exercise!

49:07.011 --> 49:09.646
Why don't we talk about
this during down time, okay?

49:09.647 --> 49:11.848
This might be what the
therapist is referring to.

49:11.849 --> 49:13.283
You're missing out on life.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.186
It's happening right now, out
here, all around us, all right?

49:16.187 --> 49:18.354
And you're too busy
complaining about your problems

49:18.355 --> 49:21.355
to enjoy all these beautiful
little fish that are...

49:26.297 --> 49:27.363
Marcel!

49:27.364 --> 49:28.498
Yes?

49:28.499 --> 49:30.533
Marcel, we have a real problem here!

49:30.534 --> 49:33.534
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!

49:33.804 --> 49:36.804
The circle of life is
circling our lives right now!

49:37.107 --> 49:40.107
Do not move, do not panic.

49:41.178 --> 49:42.345
Shark! What?

49:42.346 --> 49:43.513
Shark! Jason!

49:43.514 --> 49:45.381
Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!

49:45.382 --> 49:46.716
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

49:46.717 --> 49:47.951
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

49:47.952 --> 49:49.319
Don't worry! Wait!

49:49.320 --> 49:51.221
These are only lemon sharks!

49:51.222 --> 49:53.523
This is all part of the course.

49:53.524 --> 49:56.524
It is like life. Like in relationships.

49:56.560 --> 49:59.560
They will not attack
unless they feel attacked!

49:59.730 --> 50:02.730
Marcel, I need you to take
the French out of your mouth

50:03.501 --> 50:05.468
and tell me what to do!

50:05.469 --> 50:07.804
Don't let them see your fear.

50:07.805 --> 50:10.507
Okay, I think we just hold
tight, we play it cool,

50:10.508 --> 50:13.309
we don't make a move.

50:13.310 --> 50:14.410
What was that? What?

50:14.411 --> 50:17.411
What was that? Jason, stop...

50:17.581 --> 50:20.581
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!

50:21.218 --> 50:23.486
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!

50:23.487 --> 50:25.722
Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!

50:25.723 --> 50:28.723
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns'

50:28.826 --> 50:30.760
and it's time to shoot some fish!

50:30.761 --> 50:32.695
Here on Eden, there are no guns!

50:32.696 --> 50:34.764
You got an American life at stake.

50:34.765 --> 50:37.765
One life is not more
important than another.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.269
What do I do?

50:39.270 --> 50:41.538
My friends and my wife left me to die.

50:41.539 --> 50:44.539
You must get out of
the chum, but slowly.

50:45.109 --> 50:46.209
Okay.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.677
Swim slowly out of the chum!

50:47.678 --> 50:49.245
Slowly. Slowly. Yes, yes.

50:49.246 --> 50:51.381
Slowly, baby! Stop!

50:51.382 --> 50:53.049
I don't know what to do.

50:53.050 --> 50:55.118
I don't know if I'm standing
still or I'm swimming.

50:55.119 --> 50:58.119
Swim now! Stop!

50:59.123 --> 51:00.790
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!

51:00.791 --> 51:03.693
They're slow-playing me! Shoot them!

51:03.694 --> 51:06.694
Swim slowly.

51:08.966 --> 51:11.966
Swim, swim, swim.

51:16.874 --> 51:19.874
Save yourselves! Go to
shore! It's too late!

51:22.146 --> 51:25.146
They've got me! It's
only a matter of time!

51:25.382 --> 51:28.382
There's no sharks around you,
honey. You're safe now, baby.

51:28.552 --> 51:31.552
I don't know what's going through
my mind! I'd love some ice cream.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.156
What? I'd love some ice cream,

51:33.157 --> 51:36.157
with maybe some pecans in it!

51:37.227 --> 51:40.227
Couples' massage is part of
your program and so important.

51:40.598 --> 51:43.598
It gives you the chance
to bond, relax, reconnect.

51:43.834 --> 51:46.834
We prefer to bond on our own.

51:47.338 --> 51:50.338
Okay, would you prefer
male or female therapists?

51:51.675 --> 51:54.675
What would you recommend more for like
a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?

51:54.845 --> 51:57.347
Would that be a man or
a woman, do you think?

51:57.348 --> 51:58.481
A woman.

51:58.482 --> 52:01.482
Well, I'm just so tight in my
shoulders. Do you have any...

52:02.152 --> 52:04.520
Let me see.

52:04.521 --> 52:07.521
We do have a male
masseur available, madam.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.360
Daddy, I can't wait to
get my drink on tonight!

52:13.998 --> 52:16.998
Damn! Is this whole thing
uphill? Where's the downhill part?

52:18.636 --> 52:21.137
We gonna get our groove
on tonight. Right, Daddy?

52:21.138 --> 52:24.138
Of course, baby. You know how we do it.

52:25.009 --> 52:26.376
Well, hello.

52:26.377 --> 52:29.377
Hi.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.280
Lucy.

52:31.281 --> 52:32.382
Yes.

52:32.383 --> 52:33.483
Excellent.

52:33.484 --> 52:34.951
Who are you?

52:34.952 --> 52:37.854
I am Xavier and I will be
your man-seur for today.

52:37.855 --> 52:38.888
Xavier?

52:38.889 --> 52:40.056
Yes.

52:40.057 --> 52:43.026
Mmm.

52:43.027 --> 52:45.962
Twenty, 30, 40, 50...

52:48.365 --> 52:49.732
Hi.

52:49.733 --> 52:50.800
Joey.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.568
Yes.

52:52.569 --> 52:53.836
What's your name?

52:53.837 --> 52:54.971
Gert.

52:54.972 --> 52:56.305
What a beautiful name.

52:56.306 --> 52:58.641
Well, thank you.

52:58.642 --> 53:00.677
Do you mind if I heat up the lotion?

53:00.678 --> 53:02.879
No. Heat that lotion up.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.880
The hotter the better.

53:18.929 --> 53:21.898
What kind of massage do
you want? You left it blank.

53:21.899 --> 53:23.199
Korean?

53:23.200 --> 53:26.200
Korean? I am not familiar with Korean.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.737
Dealer's choice. Whatever
releases the most tension.

53:33.077 --> 53:36.077
Mmm.

53:36.113 --> 53:39.113
Oh, that feels so good.

53:39.249 --> 53:40.550
Thank you.

53:40.551 --> 53:43.551
I can't tell you how much I need
this. It has been a long time.

53:45.422 --> 53:48.057
Oh, I love pleasuring people.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.225
So do l.

53:49.226 --> 53:52.226
I mean, it's not my job,

53:53.197 --> 53:56.197
but it is a job that I love
doing, if you know what I mean.

53:59.470 --> 54:02.271
I know exactly what you mean.

54:02.272 --> 54:05.141
So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?

54:05.142 --> 54:07.810
I hold a lot of tension
in my upper thighs.

54:07.811 --> 54:09.779
We'll get to your upper thighs.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.647
It's just the top of my quads.

54:11.648 --> 54:12.982
As a matter of fact,
if you want to do, like,

54:12.983 --> 54:15.318
the full 80 minutes on
the thighs, I'm good.

54:15.319 --> 54:16.586
Whatever you want.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.587
Oh, I need this. You have no idea.

54:21.458 --> 54:23.292
Oh, you got great hands.

54:23.293 --> 54:26.293
Okay, Joey, what I want you to
do for me is just close your eyes.

54:28.065 --> 54:30.066
Quiet that mind, okay?

54:30.067 --> 54:31.768
Just listen to my voice.

54:31.769 --> 54:34.769
Feel the sound slide down my throat

54:37.174 --> 54:40.174
and come out through my mouth.

54:40.344 --> 54:43.344
Down my throat, come
out through my mouth.

54:47.351 --> 54:50.351
Down my throat...

54:54.491 --> 54:56.125
Keep... Keep going, keep going.

54:56.126 --> 54:57.693
Sir, I'm so sorry.

54:57.694 --> 55:00.694
No, no, no. Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.

55:01.031 --> 55:02.865
No, I aroused you.

55:02.866 --> 55:04.534
You should be proud.

55:04.535 --> 55:07.136
This hasn't happened
to me in a long time.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.137
Are you attempting to have a
manual stimulation from me, sir?

55:11.475 --> 55:13.142
Am I...

55:13.143 --> 55:16.143
I am here on a couples retreat
with my wife in the other room.

55:18.115 --> 55:20.149
My husband Scott is just like a cat.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.450
Scott?

55:21.451 --> 55:24.187
My husband.

55:24.188 --> 55:27.188
I'm trying to save my marriage
here. Look what you did to me.

55:28.225 --> 55:29.892
Well, that wasn't my intention, sir.

55:29.893 --> 55:31.828
It wasn't mine, either,
and now I'm humiliated.

55:31.829 --> 55:32.962
Well, I'm sorry.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.897
You told me not to think.

55:34.898 --> 55:36.699
Well, when I don't think,
this is what happens.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.634
You can't leave me all
backed up like this.

55:38.635 --> 55:40.203
What do you want me to do, sir?

55:40.204 --> 55:42.338
I don't know. We got to
figure out a solution.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.140
You know, let's not take
anything off the table.

55:44.141 --> 55:47.141
Let's start brainstorming. We"re
both in a maze together, okay?

55:48.412 --> 55:50.813
How do we get the cheese?

55:50.814 --> 55:53.814
I'm sorry, sir, but that is
not gonna have a happy ending.

55:58.422 --> 56:01.422
Give me the oil.

56:02.926 --> 56:05.926
Go grab a smoke.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.732
Daddy, this is awesome!

56:09.733 --> 56:12.733
Yo, they should put me up
in a video on this bitch!

56:13.170 --> 56:16.170
Don't go chasing waterfalls

56:16.440 --> 56:19.440
Stick me in the ocean I'm
gonna make it look real good

56:21.545 --> 56:24.280
You go, girl.

56:28.285 --> 56:30.453
Daddy's got to ice his knee, baby, okay?

56:30.454 --> 56:32.755
If you just let me recharge my battery,

56:32.756 --> 56:35.591
I promise, this'll be
more for you later, okay?

56:35.592 --> 56:38.592
Technically, I was bit by a shark.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.930
Were you bit or were you nipped?

56:40.931 --> 56:42.131
I mean, if you had been bit,

56:42.132 --> 56:43.799
you probably would have lost
a great deal of blood and...

56:43.800 --> 56:45.968
What difference does it
make to you two, anyway,

56:45.969 --> 56:47.136
what you would call it?

56:47.137 --> 56:50.137
It hurt. And I had shark
teeth penetrate my skin.

56:50.307 --> 56:52.475
And besides, Jason, it's
your fault that it happened.

56:52.476 --> 56:54.076
The only reason I got
bit in the first place

56:54.077 --> 56:55.611
is because you did the worst thing

56:55.612 --> 56:57.780
you could possibly do in that situation.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.949
You panicked and you threw
a bucket of chum in my face.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.817
I did the prudent thing and I
got the hell out of the water.

57:01.818 --> 57:04.787
There were sharks in there,
David. What was I supposed to do?

57:04.788 --> 57:06.289
You know what? Remember
it however you want to

57:06.290 --> 57:08.090
and I'll remember it
how it actually happened.

57:08.091 --> 57:11.091
Dave. I mean, really, did
they penetrate your skin?

57:11.128 --> 57:12.561
Do you really need that bandage?

57:12.562 --> 57:15.264
Lucy, I don't know
what to tell you, okay?

57:15.265 --> 57:18.067
You tell me if I need the bandage.

57:18.068 --> 57:19.902
It looks like you scraped
yourself on the ladder,

57:19.903 --> 57:21.070
maybe, on the way out.

57:21.071 --> 57:22.171
I'm sorry?

57:22.172 --> 57:23.506
Did you get out of the water abruptly?

57:23.507 --> 57:26.507
Hey, I don't know how to explain
it to you. Maybe I have tough skin.

57:26.643 --> 57:28.945
Perhaps lemon sharks don't
leave that bad of a mark.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.012
Maybe they're pack animals

57:30.013 --> 57:31.781
and they're marking me
for later. I don't know.

57:31.782 --> 57:33.849
Dave, I was in a car
accident once, okay?

57:33.850 --> 57:35.518
And it was really scary, I
had nightmares. But when...

57:35.519 --> 57:36.819
I've been in a car accident, too.

57:36.820 --> 57:38.020
Have you ever been bit by a shark?

57:38.021 --> 57:40.256
I was never bit by a shark. I'm
just saying that I understand. My...

57:40.257 --> 57:42.325
Say it again. I was in a car accident.

57:42.326 --> 57:43.492
No, say the last part.

57:43.493 --> 57:44.593
I was never bit by a shark.

57:44.594 --> 57:47.594
That's it! Then you
shouldn't talk about it.

57:48.699 --> 57:51.500
And I'm not gonna sit here
and try to explain myself

57:51.501 --> 57:54.003
to a bunch of black
and white suburban trash

57:54.004 --> 57:56.172
who don't know a damn
thing about the ocean.

57:56.173 --> 57:57.807
And you understand the ocean, honey?

57:57.808 --> 57:59.442
I have some real field
experience, honey, yeah.

57:59.443 --> 58:00.543
I had a shark attack.

58:00.544 --> 58:02.511
I'm part of a very elite group.

58:02.512 --> 58:03.713
Like people who have
been struck by lightning.

58:03.714 --> 58:04.981
Not everyone can say
that they've had that

58:04.982 --> 58:07.650
and maybe that's what's
going on here today.

58:07.651 --> 58:09.385
You know what? I don't want
to get in an argument with it.

58:09.386 --> 58:11.220
I really don't. You know what?

58:11.221 --> 58:13.122
I'm really exhausted.
It's been a long day.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.123
I'm gonna go back to the
room. You want to come with me?

58:17.361 --> 58:19.462
Baby, I thought we were gonna
go to the waterfall tonight

58:19.463 --> 58:21.397
and have a little alone time.

58:21.398 --> 58:23.833
Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor.

58:25.168 --> 58:26.369
I'm fried.

58:26.370 --> 58:29.370
Honey, I think the fear was a
lot worse than the actual attack,

58:29.906 --> 58:31.874
which I can totally appreciate,

58:31.875 --> 58:33.809
but the good news is you weren't hurt,

58:33.810 --> 58:36.078
so let's not ruin the evening over it.

58:36.079 --> 58:37.713
I'm sorry?

58:37.714 --> 58:39.582
Honey, you weren't hurt.

58:39.583 --> 58:41.851
Good night.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.252
Dave! Where you going?

58:43.253 --> 58:44.720
Dave. Come on, okay,
you got bit by the shark.

58:44.721 --> 58:46.322
You got bit, I believe you!

58:46.323 --> 58:49.323
We're here all the time, so let's
take that opportunity to go to bed.

58:51.728 --> 58:53.262
Honey, we'll go to
the waterfall with you.

58:53.263 --> 58:54.597
We'll grab our drinks and go.

58:54.598 --> 58:57.433
Yeah. We could all go
together. It'll be beautiful.

58:57.434 --> 59:00.369
Hon? I was thinking that maybe

59:00.370 --> 59:02.605
we might go back to the room, huh?

59:02.606 --> 59:05.374
Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?

59:05.375 --> 59:07.510
Just shut the whole world out

59:07.511 --> 59:10.511
and sit Indian-style and
really explore our feelings.

59:13.884 --> 59:15.351
Daddy! Wake up!

59:15.352 --> 59:17.286
It's too deep!

59:17.287 --> 59:20.287
Yo, you having a nightmare. You ain't
even in the water. It's night time.

59:20.457 --> 59:23.457
Look, you said we was gonna have
fun, so let's get up, let's dance,

59:24.361 --> 59:27.296
let's do a shot, let's
do something. Anything.

59:27.297 --> 59:29.432
Baby, let's just go back
to the room, all right?

59:29.433 --> 59:32.433
I don't want to go back to the
room. I don't want to go to sleep.

59:32.702 --> 59:34.470
We're not going to sleep.

59:34.471 --> 59:35.638
We're not?

59:35.639 --> 59:37.206
Mmm-mmm.

59:37.207 --> 59:39.075
What we gonna do in there?

59:40.577 --> 59:43.577
For real?

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.865
So how was your night?

01:00:01.866 --> 01:00:04.866
My husband found himself in a
very traumatic shark situation.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:06.603
Here we go.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:09.604
As we were planning to go to the
waterfall and have a romantic evening,

01:00:10.141 --> 01:00:11.875
because, as you know, we
don't do that very often

01:00:11.876 --> 01:00:13.544
because of the kids and work...

01:00:13.545 --> 01:00:16.546
But somehow, this crazy,
traumatic shark experience

01:00:16.682 --> 01:00:19.682
was enough to make him neglect his wife.

01:00:21.187 --> 01:00:24.187
Ronnie, nice to meet you. Well said.

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:26.792
David, how did that make you feel?

01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:28.227
I know my truth.

01:00:28.228 --> 01:00:30.029
Excuse me? I know my truth.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:32.965
Did you say, "l know my truth',?

01:00:32.966 --> 01:00:34.867
Oh, boy.

01:00:34.868 --> 01:00:37.869
Listen, I'm telling you,
you getting on my last nerve!

01:00:38.172 --> 01:00:39.906
Yo, I didn't sign up for this!

01:00:39.907 --> 01:00:41.675
Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing.

01:00:41.676 --> 01:00:43.076
You said we was gonna be partying.

01:00:43.077 --> 01:00:45.178
You said we was gonna
be doing what we do.

01:00:45.179 --> 01:00:47.247
You made promises, Daddy.

01:00:47.248 --> 01:00:50.184
Boo-Boo, look, they got me
doing a lot of activities.

01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:51.386
What do you expect from me?

01:00:51.387 --> 01:00:52.587
I'm tired.

01:00:52.588 --> 01:00:54.922
You tired? Yo, I'm tired.

01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:57.392
Plain and simple, I ain't having it.

01:00:57.393 --> 01:01:00.393
Sometimes we forget how to do
the easiest thing in the world,

01:01:02.365 --> 01:01:05.365
which is just to talk to each other.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.505
Okay, let's start here.
Lucy, you go first.

01:01:09.506 --> 01:01:12.506
I want you to look at Joey and say hi.

01:01:13.277 --> 01:01:14.544
And Joey, after you've heard that,

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:17.545
I want you to look back at
Lucy and say hello in return.

01:01:19.116 --> 01:01:22.116
And then we'll just see where
it goes from there, okay?

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.394
Hi.

01:01:32.431 --> 01:01:34.131
Hello.

01:01:34.132 --> 01:01:37.133
You kept saying "open" and
"fruitful" and other weird stuff.

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:41.404
That's not feeling, it's just more
talking in short half-sentences,

01:01:42.108 --> 01:01:45.108
and you managed to turn feeling
into a job or an activity,

01:01:45.878 --> 01:01:47.612
and it was exhausting.

01:01:47.613 --> 01:01:49.148
So now it's my fault that
you don't feel satisfied!

01:01:49.149 --> 01:01:51.150
Everything is my fault?
Is that what you're saying?

01:01:51.151 --> 01:01:53.119
I'm not saying that! I'm
crazy? You don't look at me!

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.054
You don't ever ask me how I am! I work!

01:01:55.055 --> 01:01:56.722
You haven't looked at me in 10 years!

01:01:56.723 --> 01:01:58.658
I'm crazy and everything is my fault,

01:01:58.659 --> 01:02:01.660
and my family is awful, and
nothing at all is your fault!

01:02:02.897 --> 01:02:04.064
'Cause you rock, Joey!

01:02:04.065 --> 01:02:06.166
If a guy talked to me like
that, I'd punch him in the face.

01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:08.435
You're such an asshole!

01:02:08.436 --> 01:02:09.970
You're an asshole!

01:02:09.971 --> 01:02:12.339
It's like a little kid who
gets a puppy for the first time,

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.341
just hugs it so much, snaps its neck.

01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:16.511
Cynthia's your puppy.

01:02:16.512 --> 01:02:17.979
It's puppy-cradle death syndrome.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.448
All that love is gonna snap that puppy.

01:02:20.449 --> 01:02:21.516
Yeah, but... You don't want that!

01:02:25.856 --> 01:02:28.856
The dawning of a new day.

01:02:29.126 --> 01:02:32.126
A marriage is not a timeless agreement.

01:02:32.462 --> 01:02:35.462
It is one day. And each
day, it begins anew.

01:02:38.536 --> 01:02:41.536
Moments. Life is made of them,

01:02:41.706 --> 01:02:44.706
much the same as a great mosaic.

01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:47.709
A thousand little pieces
that make one great image.

01:02:51.383 --> 01:02:54.383
But the most important
thing in life is...

01:02:59.024 --> 01:03:02.025
And today, we open the door to breath

01:03:02.462 --> 01:03:05.462
with a shared yoga group experience.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.532
Our instructor,
Salvadore, is running late.

01:03:09.903 --> 01:03:12.739
So I will touch on tomorrow.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.740
It is very important that
you are here before sunrise,

01:03:16.544 --> 01:03:19.544
as well as not eat or drink
anything too late tonight.

01:03:21.382 --> 01:03:22.849
As you pursue knowledge,

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:25.851
as well as your own
individual animal spirits,

01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:29.354
it is very important that you
strictly follow your programs.

01:03:30.725 --> 01:03:33.725
Failure to do so will
definitely take you off your path

01:03:35.598 --> 01:03:38.598
and lead you away from
the answers you seek.

01:03:38.734 --> 01:03:40.235
I'm sorry, monsieur Marcel.

01:03:40.236 --> 01:03:42.437
Why is it so important for
us to be on time tomorrow

01:03:42.438 --> 01:03:44.439
when Pablo, the yoga guy,
is running late today?

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.107
Quiet, please.

01:03:46.108 --> 01:03:49.109
The yoga teacher's punctuality
is not your concern.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.280
You are to be here before sunrise.

01:03:58.121 --> 01:04:01.024
Why is it so important for us to be here
on time tomorrow? I'm not understanding.

01:04:01.025 --> 01:04:02.426
Why can't we eat or drink tomorrow?

01:04:02.427 --> 01:04:05.427
What, is he gonna probe us?

01:04:13.872 --> 01:04:16.872
Who is that?

01:04:19.044 --> 01:04:22.044
Oh, my.

01:04:22.915 --> 01:04:25.916
Damn!

01:04:25.986 --> 01:04:27.653
I guess that's the yoga guy.

01:04:27.654 --> 01:04:29.922
This just gets better and better.

01:04:29.923 --> 01:04:32.923
Well, hello. I am so sorry I'm late.

01:04:32.993 --> 01:04:35.994
I just swam from the
other side of the island.

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:39.163
Please, allow me to put on something
more proper before we can begin.

01:04:39.934 --> 01:04:41.901
Thank God.

01:04:41.902 --> 01:04:44.404
There we go. Much better.

01:04:44.405 --> 01:04:46.339
Now, who is ready for their yoga?

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.075
My name's Jason. Jason.

01:04:48.076 --> 01:04:49.343
Pleasure, hi. Nice.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.411
Cynthia. Hi. Can't wait.

01:04:50.412 --> 01:04:53.412
Hello, Cynthia.

01:04:53.482 --> 01:04:56.482
Yes, we have a brave
peacock. Use that. Yes.

01:04:57.252 --> 01:04:59.588
Yes. Hi, you must be Veronica. Hi.

01:04:59.589 --> 01:05:00.989
Yeah, how did you know?

01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:03.990
Why, I have read that you have
studied the yoga for five years.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.460
Oh, well, I mean, just off and
on, you know, before the kids came.

01:05:08.698 --> 01:05:11.699
Nonsense. You know, there is such
thing called the muscle memory?

01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:15.269
And I could tell by looking at
your gait, your muscles remember.

01:05:16.507 --> 01:05:17.974
Thank you. Yes.

01:05:17.975 --> 01:05:20.975
Okay, we are going to do
the children's position.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:23.280
What's that?

01:05:23.281 --> 01:05:25.049
Head down, buttocks up.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.117
Everybody on your mats.

01:05:27.118 --> 01:05:30.118
Yeah, that's good. That's
good. Very nice posture. Yes.

01:05:32.657 --> 01:05:34.626
Encouragement.

01:05:34.627 --> 01:05:37.627
So I will transfer you my
energy. I will transfer my karma.

01:05:38.664 --> 01:05:40.565
Here is my karma on you.

01:05:40.566 --> 01:05:41.866
Jason!

01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:43.702
You have a great aura. Yes.

01:05:43.703 --> 01:05:45.470
Jason! Encouragement!

01:05:45.471 --> 01:05:48.472
Yes! This is a great way to stretch.

01:05:48.642 --> 01:05:50.142
Yep. You see?

01:05:50.143 --> 01:05:51.711
You could do this with
your partner at home.

01:05:51.712 --> 01:05:53.346
Sure. Let's ride this energy out!

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:54.914
Keep your chin up. Yep.

01:05:54.915 --> 01:05:57.916
Yes, this fire has just started.
And we will not put it out.

01:05:58.886 --> 01:06:00.087
What is he doing?

01:06:00.088 --> 01:06:02.389
I don't really know that pose.

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:04.925
Okay, now we go into
the happy baby pose.

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:07.194
No, no, no, no, no,
no. Please regard me.

01:06:07.195 --> 01:06:08.929
I'm sorry? Please, allow me.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.164
To do what? Regard me.

01:06:10.165 --> 01:06:11.933
Okay. Yes.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.067
Okay.

01:06:13.068 --> 01:06:15.069
You are doing fantastic, my dear.

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:16.671
Thank you. Okay.

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:18.439
See as I gently pulsate.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.607
Okay...

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:21.576
Trying to go deeper and deeper,

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.578
and bring her deeper and
deeper into a stretch, yes?

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:26.949
Okay, Fabio, that's enough
of the pulsating. Please.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.950
Then do it! Yes!
Encouragement, my friend.

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:35.022
Yes, fantastic progress.
Yes, put your shoulders back.

01:06:37.628 --> 01:06:40.628
Yes. Now feel the energy.
Feel that energy. Yes.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:46.468
Through your chest.
Your peacock chest. Yes.

01:06:47.973 --> 01:06:50.973
Good! You like that? Yes. Good job.

01:06:52.711 --> 01:06:55.711
Encouragement. Yes. Great job.

01:06:57.215 --> 01:06:59.718
There, you need to find
your mental equilibrity.

01:06:59.719 --> 01:07:00.986
Not on my knees, man, that hurts.

01:07:00.987 --> 01:07:02.320
It's okay, it's okay.

01:07:02.321 --> 01:07:03.989
Know your limits, yes?

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:06.990
There is no giving up in yoga,
you know? Encouragement, yes!

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.129
Encouragement my ass,
Daddy! You ain't even trying!

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.265
Look, yoga's not my strong suit.

01:07:12.266 --> 01:07:14.667
Yoga's not your strong suit?

01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:16.836
Oh, look at this one. This
little one is flexible.

01:07:16.837 --> 01:07:18.171
She's good. She's really good.

01:07:18.172 --> 01:07:20.006
Ooh, fantastic.

01:07:20.007 --> 01:07:21.175
So you do like the lizard.

01:07:21.176 --> 01:07:23.911
Now is when we transfer
the energy, you see?

01:07:23.912 --> 01:07:25.913
Yep. And you just lay
everything on top of her?

01:07:25.914 --> 01:07:28.914
Yes. Lay it on. Stretch.

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:31.917
That feels pretty good, hon?

01:07:33.255 --> 01:07:34.355
What?

01:07:35.491 --> 01:07:38.491
Am I straight enough here, do you
think? Or am I curving a little?

01:07:38.794 --> 01:07:40.161
Let me show you.

01:07:40.162 --> 01:07:41.696
You feel the transfer of the energy.

01:07:41.697 --> 01:07:42.797
Well, it feels solid.

01:07:42.798 --> 01:07:44.599
It is tantric energy. Yeah.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.601
It is karma. Yes.

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:50.938
Okay, now I want all my girls
in a downward dog position.

01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:54.541
Yes, this pose contains
a tantric hip thrust.

01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:56.378
Now you and I will try this.

01:07:56.379 --> 01:07:58.815
You got a pose called "Yoga
Guy Gets His Ass Kicked',?

01:07:58.816 --> 01:08:00.050
"Cause that's my favorite one.

01:08:01.152 --> 01:08:03.220
I feel your anger, yes!

01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:06.221
Yes, I got your blood pumping,
yes? No? Now use it! Harness it!

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:10.061
Hmm. Boom!

01:08:10.062 --> 01:08:13.062
Everybody into the children's pose!

01:08:13.065 --> 01:08:14.332
Heads down. Okay.

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.567
Close your eyes. Yes?

01:08:16.568 --> 01:08:18.970
Yes, good. Let's breathe.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.971
Excuse me, Salvadore? I feel
like my sacrum is really tight.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.743
Could you just help me
stretch it out a little?

01:08:24.743 --> 01:08:27.412
Yes, of course, I will play
the role of your husband.

01:08:27.412 --> 01:08:28.580
Great.

01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:31.581
Boom, boom.
-.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:36.319
Boom.

01:08:38.158 --> 01:08:41.158
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:44.497
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.

01:08:44.499 --> 01:08:46.200
What if Joey had seen?

01:08:46.201 --> 01:08:47.835
Lucy, it was really inappropriate.

01:08:47.836 --> 01:08:50.836
Well, I didn't know that you were
so concerned about how Joey felt.

01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:52.740
What's that supposed to mean?

01:08:52.741 --> 01:08:55.676
Let's drop it.

01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:58.678
All I'm saying is that it
was pretty uncomfortable.

01:08:59.715 --> 01:09:01.116
Well, then why were you staring?

01:09:01.117 --> 01:09:03.018
It was hard to miss.

01:09:03.019 --> 01:09:06.019
Trust me, Salvadore is
the least of our problems.

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:10.893
It's freezing in here. Why
would they make a room like this?

01:09:10.894 --> 01:09:13.696
You should have seen my
masseuse. She was so hot.

01:09:13.697 --> 01:09:15.298
You're supposed to be relaxing out here.

01:09:15.299 --> 01:09:18.067
Why do you think I wanted
to get a full release?

01:09:18.068 --> 01:09:19.937
You know what? I don't even
want to get into this with you.

01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:21.037
Into what?

01:09:21.038 --> 01:09:22.973
I don't want to get into
this conversation with you.

01:09:22.974 --> 01:09:24.241
Why is that?

01:09:24.242 --> 01:09:26.577
Because I don't want to be put in
a position where l,d have to lie.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.045
Why are you getting all
high and mighty on me?

01:09:28.046 --> 01:09:30.546
No, I'm not so high and mighty.
Joey, I'm not judging you,

01:09:30.548 --> 01:09:31.983
I'm just not asking anything because

01:09:31.984 --> 01:09:33.785
I don't want... I don't want to know.

01:09:33.786 --> 01:09:35.319
Because that way, if someone asks me...

01:09:35.321 --> 01:09:36.821
You won't have to rat me out.

01:09:36.822 --> 01:09:38.957
I would never rat you out. Of
course I wouldn't't rat you out.

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.158
Right, right. But this
way, I don't have to

01:09:40.158 --> 01:09:41.658
make that decision because
I really don't know.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.328
All right, let me ask
you something, then.

01:09:43.328 --> 01:09:46.231
Could you honestly say that
after seven years together,

01:09:46.232 --> 01:09:48.100
that you get turned
on by the same woman?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.234
I do.

01:09:49.234 --> 01:09:50.769
Without going to the highlight reel.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.171
You're playing a verbal shell game.

01:09:52.171 --> 01:09:53.505
l... You have to make
your own decisions.

01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:54.640
I'm just saying I don't want to know.

01:09:54.641 --> 01:09:56.242
I'm saying, if you're...
When you're sleeping with her,

01:09:56.243 --> 01:09:57.744
if you're hitting up some fan favorites,

01:09:57.745 --> 01:09:59.179
I think you're cheating on some level.

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.847
You might not be acting on
it, but you're fantasizing.

01:10:00.848 --> 01:10:02.415
You know what? I don't
know what journey you're on,

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:04.618
but l... I can't take
this trip with you.

01:10:04.619 --> 01:10:06.286
But if I told you, as a friend...

01:10:06.287 --> 01:10:09.288
I came up to you, I said, "Hey,
Dave, I'm attracted to men."

01:10:10.692 --> 01:10:13.194
I was thinking about their bodies
and things, but I didn't act on it

01:10:13.195 --> 01:10:16.195
because I'm straight and
I was being very strong,

01:10:16.298 --> 01:10:18.432
would you consider me straight or gay?

01:10:18.433 --> 01:10:20.836
If I desired a man.

01:10:20.837 --> 01:10:22.871
If I was thinking about a man's body,

01:10:22.872 --> 01:10:25.872
like how the light reflects
off of his sweaty back...

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:29.511
Am I interrupting something? No.

01:10:29.512 --> 01:10:30.980
We're great. Have a
seat. Want to sit down?

01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:32.148
Enjoy this. Enjoy it.

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:33.383
No, I'm good here. Thank you.

01:10:33.384 --> 01:10:35.718
If I was sleeping with my wife

01:10:35.719 --> 01:10:37.720
and thinking about, like,
a dude's wet mouth...

01:10:37.721 --> 01:10:40.721
Snow and steam, huh? Is
this place outstanding?

01:10:41.392 --> 01:10:42.893
Okay, Jason, let me
ask you a question here.

01:10:42.894 --> 01:10:44.561
Is the highlight reel
considered cheating?

01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:46.163
The highlight reel? No.

01:10:46.164 --> 01:10:48.032
I'm just saying everybody
cheats and everybody lies,

01:10:48.033 --> 01:10:51.033
and whether they act upon it or
not is a secondary conversation.

01:10:51.736 --> 01:10:52.903
So you're saying that you can't tell

01:10:52.904 --> 01:10:54.806
the difference between
the highlight reel...

01:10:54.807 --> 01:10:56.141
I can tell the difference.

01:10:56.142 --> 01:10:57.375
...and physically, really
cheating on somebody?

01:10:57.376 --> 01:10:58.743
Don't say it to me like I
can't tell the difference.

01:10:58.744 --> 01:10:59.844
Well, that's what you're saying!

01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:01.012
You're saying that they,re related,

01:11:01.013 --> 01:11:02.180
then they're somehow in the same family.

01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:04.215
No, no. I'm saying you own a Jack
Russell, I own a Bull Terrier.

01:11:04.216 --> 01:11:05.984
They're both dogs.
They're both terriers.

01:11:05.985 --> 01:11:07.386
Mine's just a little more
aggressive than yours.

01:11:07.387 --> 01:11:08.587
I own a zebra, you own a goat.

01:11:08.588 --> 01:11:10.356
What the hell's that have to
do with cheating on your wife?

01:11:10.357 --> 01:11:11.891
Right, they're both animals.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:14.892
Are you out of your mind? How
would you feel if your wife cheated?

01:11:31.113 --> 01:11:34.113
Guys? Listen to me. Trudy's gone.

01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:36.784
What? What do you mean?

01:11:36.785 --> 01:11:37.952
What? I went to the room

01:11:37.953 --> 01:11:39.287
and all her stuff was gone.

01:11:39.288 --> 01:11:41.355
Where do... Where do you
think she went? Like she...

01:11:41.356 --> 01:11:43.025
I don't know. We had
a argument at therapy.

01:11:43.026 --> 01:11:45.928
She said she was sick of
my senior citizen bullshit.

01:11:45.929 --> 01:11:48.297
I've been trying to keep up
with her, but I'm a old ass!

01:11:48.298 --> 01:11:50.532
Shane, honey, it's not your fault.

01:11:50.533 --> 01:11:53.469
No, it's bullshit. It is my
fault. I should have worked harder.

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:54.637
Now she's gone!

01:11:54.638 --> 01:11:57.638
She's not gone. I know where she is.

01:11:59.643 --> 01:12:02.643
Sit down.

01:12:02.913 --> 01:12:04.581
How do you know where she is?

01:12:04.582 --> 01:12:06.450
Now use your head.

01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:09.451
She's a young girl. She wants
to party. She wants to get wild.

01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:12.890
Too late to leave the
island. Where is she?

01:12:12.891 --> 01:12:15.493
Where's the only place she could go?

01:12:15.494 --> 01:12:18.495
Eden East, the singles' side.

01:12:19.165 --> 01:12:20.298
We gotta go get her.

01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:21.967
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!

01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:23.435
I am not letting you go alone!

01:12:23.436 --> 01:12:26.436
I don't care if I have
to go there all night!

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.341
To find Trudy. We're gonna
go find Trudy for him!

01:12:31.445 --> 01:12:33.846
We can't even go to
that side, all right?

01:12:33.847 --> 01:12:36.847
And it's gonna get very dark, very
soon. Plus we have to be in bed...

01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.785
What are you talking about?

01:12:38.786 --> 01:12:40.186
Listen to me.

01:12:40.187 --> 01:12:42.356
We have to be to bed at a
very reasonable hour tonight

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:44.358
because we cannot miss
the sunrise in the morning.

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.693
Now, Marcel said if
we miss that sunrise,

01:12:46.694 --> 01:12:48.595
we will not be completing our course.

01:12:48.596 --> 01:12:50.798
We are here for the course, all right?
- Yes.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.533
And stop eating and drinking, as well.

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:55.535
Honey, our friend is
asking for our help.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.872
She's 20 years old, for God's sake.

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.874
She's probably with a bunch
of dudes, like, sweating,

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:02.875
drinking and dancing it out of
her system. What's the problem?

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.214
Let her spend the night on Hump Island!

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:08.215
I promise, she's gonna come back
here first thing in the morning!

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:09.518
Dave, firstly...

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:12.519
I don't want her to spend
a night on Hump Island.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.190
No, I... I'm just trying to say

01:13:14.191 --> 01:13:16.058
it's not like she's
kidnapped or something.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.862
Now she's dead, Dave? Huh?

01:13:18.863 --> 01:13:20.664
Now she's dead? She's
dead, now? She's not dead.

01:13:20.665 --> 01:13:22.732
She's dead on Hump Island!

01:13:22.733 --> 01:13:24.401
I'm just trying to put
it in perspective for you!

01:13:24.402 --> 01:13:26.570
You know what? I don't even
know why I'm blowing up at you,

01:13:26.571 --> 01:13:28.805
because it... It's...
Once again, it's my fault.

01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:31.576
This is a Shane thing. I've been
dealing with this all my life.

01:13:31.577 --> 01:13:34.577
First Jennifer, and now Trudy.

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.715
We're gonna find her,
okay? I got a plan.

01:13:37.716 --> 01:13:38.916
I know how to get there.

01:13:38.917 --> 01:13:40.084
You do?

01:13:40.085 --> 01:13:42.087
Yeah, I do.

01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:45.088
I just can't tell you now "cause
we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us.

01:13:46.993 --> 01:13:49.595
Now everybody take it real casual.

01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:52.264
Just drink your drinks and smile.

01:13:52.265 --> 01:13:53.933
So we just make it all nice.

01:13:53.934 --> 01:13:56.502
Everything's easy, fun,
we're drinking, we're smiling.

01:13:56.503 --> 01:13:58.104
Okay? We can't leave till sundown.

01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:01.105
Guys, we all need to be together
first thing in the morning, okay?

01:14:01.609 --> 01:14:03.743
Which is exactly why
we have to find Trudy.

01:14:03.744 --> 01:14:06.745
Otherwise, we won't all be there.

01:14:06.748 --> 01:14:09.748
Let's get out of here now. Reconvene
later at the beach, at 1900 hours.

01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:13.719
You with me?

01:14:15.123 --> 01:14:18.124
Joey, we are not gonna be able to
finish the program if we get caught!

01:14:18.928 --> 01:14:21.928
All right, bring it in.

01:14:22.431 --> 01:14:25.431
Hey, come on, Shane!

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:28.103
We walk to the other
side, we get caught.

01:14:28.104 --> 01:14:30.106
This way, we canoe out nice and easy,

01:14:30.107 --> 01:14:32.041
we find ourselves a nice, quiet beach.

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:33.976
We pull up. We find the singles' side,

01:14:33.977 --> 01:14:36.145
we find a dance floor,
we find some cocktails.

01:14:36.146 --> 01:14:37.980
And we find Trudy and
we bring her back...

01:14:37.981 --> 01:14:40.384
Yeah, we find Trudy and we
bring her right back here.

01:14:40.385 --> 01:14:41.818
This is crazy.

01:14:41.819 --> 01:14:44.154
Trust me. I was an Eagle Scout.

01:14:44.155 --> 01:14:46.990
My mind is a compass. I
can handle these situations.

01:14:46.991 --> 01:14:49.393
I've been trained to do so.

01:14:49.394 --> 01:14:51.161
Now follow me and I'm
gonna get you there,

01:14:51.162 --> 01:14:53.498
but we gotta do it quick
and we gotta do it quiet.

01:14:53.499 --> 01:14:55.633
Come on.

01:14:55.634 --> 01:14:57.602
These are not the best laid plans, okay?

01:14:57.603 --> 01:14:59.637
I'm just gonna go on
record right now, okay?

01:14:59.638 --> 01:15:02.638
I do not think this has a high chance...

01:15:08.181 --> 01:15:11.181
If we keep up this pace,
we'll be there in 20 minutes!

01:15:11.418 --> 01:15:14.418
I hope so!

01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:20.291
What was that?

01:15:20.628 --> 01:15:22.028
Great! Awesome!

01:15:22.029 --> 01:15:23.363
What do we do?

01:15:23.364 --> 01:15:25.098
No!

01:15:25.099 --> 01:15:28.100
Jason! Cynthia!

01:15:28.937 --> 01:15:30.204
Cynthia!

01:15:30.205 --> 01:15:33.205
Grab the oar!

01:15:36.144 --> 01:15:38.512
Are you okay?

01:15:38.513 --> 01:15:39.948
You all right?

01:15:39.949 --> 01:15:41.049
Yeah.

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:44.050
We gotta go to shore!

01:15:48.324 --> 01:15:50.058
Cynthia, we're out of synch again.

01:15:50.059 --> 01:15:52.562
You know, you gotta paddle on
the opposite side of the boat!

01:15:52.563 --> 01:15:55.298
Well, Jason, I can't see
which side you're paddling on!

01:15:55.299 --> 01:15:56.966
Well, turn around and take
a look every once in a while.

01:15:56.967 --> 01:15:59.736
Otherwise, we are gonna capsize
again. You get that, right?

01:15:59.737 --> 01:16:01.137
It was an accident.

01:16:01.138 --> 01:16:03.206
I'll bet it could have been avoided.

01:16:03.207 --> 01:16:06.208
Right? Am I right? Baby'
I need you to paddle.

01:16:06.644 --> 01:16:08.212
Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!

01:16:08.213 --> 01:16:09.313
You know what?

01:16:09.314 --> 01:16:11.382
Sit down. You've got
to sit down in the boat!

01:16:11.383 --> 01:16:14.383
Cynthia! Cynthia!

01:16:14.886 --> 01:16:15.987
Cynthia!

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.255
What are you doing?

01:16:17.256 --> 01:16:20.256
Cynthia! Cynthia! Hey! Cynthia!

01:16:26.699 --> 01:16:28.934
Thank God. Thank God that is over!

01:16:28.935 --> 01:16:30.736
I mean, who jumps out of the canoe?

01:16:30.737 --> 01:16:32.271
You could have really
hurt yourself out there!

01:16:32.272 --> 01:16:34.440
Put these on. Cynthia?
Jason, I have had it!

01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:36.709
I can't do everything
exactly the way you want!

01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:39.711
I can't control the ocean and
row the boat and stop the waves!

01:16:40.014 --> 01:16:41.114
Calm down!

01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:44.115
And I can't do anything about the
fact that I can't get pregnant!

01:16:49.957 --> 01:16:52.427
This is nuts.

01:16:52.428 --> 01:16:55.428
No, it's me.

01:16:56.698 --> 01:16:59.467
And I just really need
some time right now.

01:16:59.468 --> 01:17:02.468
Please stop following me, 'cause
I need to be away from you.

01:17:02.739 --> 01:17:05.739
Come on. What are you doing? Hey,
hey, where you going? That's a jungle!

01:17:07.777 --> 01:17:09.812
You know what? I'm gonna
go check on her, okay?

01:17:09.813 --> 01:17:11.313
Great, thank you.

01:17:11.314 --> 01:17:12.781
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

01:17:12.782 --> 01:17:14.283
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.

01:17:14.284 --> 01:17:15.652
Honey, I don't think it's a good idea

01:17:15.653 --> 01:17:16.953
that everyone separates right now.

01:17:16.954 --> 01:17:18.088
I really don't think we have a choice.

01:17:18.089 --> 01:17:19.155
Let me just go talk to her.

01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:21.391
No, Jason, she really
needs a minute, okay?

01:17:21.392 --> 01:17:22.926
All right, go ahead. I gotta go.

01:17:22.927 --> 01:17:24.894
Baby! You guys go ahead!

01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:27.896
We'll meet you guys there!

01:17:30.735 --> 01:17:33.237
So, what are we gonna do about Trudy?

01:17:33.238 --> 01:17:34.572
What are we gonna do about Cynthia,

01:17:34.573 --> 01:17:36.407
who just disappeared into the jungle?

01:17:36.408 --> 01:17:39.409
Jason, she's upset. Let her cool
down. You'll talk to her later.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.515
We still gotta get Trudy to do all
the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right?

01:17:43.516 --> 01:17:46.516
So let's just get her ass
and let's get back home.

01:17:47.019 --> 01:17:50.019
Cyn, please, slow down, honey.
I think we're almost there.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.958
I think we might have
taken a wrong turn.

01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:57.294
Really? Yeah.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:01.799
Wow.

01:18:08.343 --> 01:18:11.343
Finally made it to the waterfall.

01:18:15.217 --> 01:18:17.785
I think my marriage is over.

01:18:17.786 --> 01:18:18.887
What?

01:18:18.888 --> 01:18:21.222
Honey, don't say that.
You're just exhausted.

01:18:21.223 --> 01:18:24.223
I am. I'm so tired of him trying
to steer everything in the direction

01:18:27.063 --> 01:18:29.498
that he thinks is right all the time.

01:18:29.499 --> 01:18:32.499
Listen. Don't make any
decisions right now.

01:18:32.736 --> 01:18:34.236
You guys just need to take a breather.

01:18:34.237 --> 01:18:36.138
Get a little bit of space, you know?

01:18:36.139 --> 01:18:37.574
You'll be okay. You know?

01:18:37.575 --> 01:18:40.310
You guys have been on top of
each other ever since we got here.

01:18:40.311 --> 01:18:43.311
No, that's the... Actually, the
one thing that we haven't done.

01:18:45.716 --> 01:18:48.716
We haven't had sex
since we've been here.

01:18:50.088 --> 01:18:53.088
We've barely even touched each other.

01:18:54.092 --> 01:18:55.993
Now, Cynthia and I
are in a terrible spot.

01:18:55.994 --> 01:18:58.162
I come to this island, I come to
the program to get some answers,

01:18:58.163 --> 01:18:59.397
find out my animal spirit... Yeah.

01:18:59.398 --> 01:19:00.932
Let me help you out on the
whole animal spirit thing.

01:19:00.933 --> 01:19:03.268
It's gonna be awesome! It always is.

01:19:03.269 --> 01:19:05.771
It's like if you go to a tarot
card reader for past lives,

01:19:05.772 --> 01:19:06.939
you're always something cool... Dave...

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.440
...like a king or a gunfighter.

01:19:08.441 --> 01:19:09.675
No one ever finds out that they were,

01:19:09.676 --> 01:19:11.109
like, a shopkeeper or an asshole.

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:12.945
Is this hilarious to you?
'Cause it's not to me.

01:19:12.946 --> 01:19:15.715
Tell you what+ If I get kicked off
this island, I'm gonna blame all of you.

01:19:15.716 --> 01:19:18.084
And I can't believe I let
the two of you derail me!

01:19:18.085 --> 01:19:19.619
We derailed you? That's correct.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:20.753
If you kept a closer eye on Trudy,

01:19:20.754 --> 01:19:23.623
she wouldn't have strayed so
far from the pack, all right?

01:19:23.624 --> 01:19:25.459
She's not a dog, Jason.
Yeah? Well, listen,

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.461
she's been very selfish, hasn't
been a very good teammate.

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:28.596
I can tell you that. No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.431
Look, I made promises, I let her down.

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:33.033
You don't know the ins and
outs of our relationship.

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:35.569
Is that what it is? It's a
relationship? It's been two weeks, okay?

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.038
All right? That's not a relationship.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:38.740
It's more like an
antibiotic cycle, all right?

01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:40.475
She should be very happy
that she's even here.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:41.910
You're a good guy. You
brought her to this island.

01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:42.978
She shouldn't be running off.

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.045
She should be doing
everything that she can,

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.647
bending over backwards
to make you happy.

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:47.983
Don't blame this on Shane.
You brought this on yourself.

01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:49.318
I don't need to hear it from you, okay?

01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:50.653
It's half your fault. Half his fault,

01:19:50.654 --> 01:19:52.154
half Trudy's fault, half your fault.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.156
Me? Yeah, with the whole canoe scheme?

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:57.157
All right? You put me and my
wife in a very extreme situation,

01:19:57.294 --> 01:19:58.661
put tension on the relationship.

01:19:58.662 --> 01:20:00.831
Your wife left you because
you were suffocating her.

01:20:00.832 --> 01:20:02.299
And now you're suffocating me!

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.900
And you're suffocating Shane, too!

01:20:03.901 --> 01:20:06.901
Yeah, don't suffocate me, man.

01:20:07.138 --> 01:20:10.138
A grown woman literally jumped
into shark-infested waters

01:20:10.475 --> 01:20:12.977
and did a distance swim that
she had no way to train for

01:20:12.978 --> 01:20:15.947
instead of staying in
a dry canoe with you.

01:20:15.948 --> 01:20:17.515
Look in the mirror.

01:20:17.516 --> 01:20:20.018
Okay, Joseph Cecil Tanzini,

01:20:20.019 --> 01:20:23.019
with a monsoon of respect, I
don't think you're in a position

01:20:23.022 --> 01:20:24.590
to be telling anyone
to look in the mirror

01:20:24.591 --> 01:20:26.091
when it comes to relationships.

01:20:26.092 --> 01:20:28.661
You're not Mr. "'I Try So
Hard At My Relationship," okay?

01:20:28.662 --> 01:20:30.362
So let's go, glass house.

01:20:30.363 --> 01:20:32.031
Me, glass house?

01:20:32.032 --> 01:20:34.700
You, glass house!
You're the glass house!

01:20:34.701 --> 01:20:36.303
Talk to me about relationships.

01:20:36.304 --> 01:20:37.837
You got a woman who adores you.

01:20:37.838 --> 01:20:39.172
She'd do anything for you.

01:20:39.173 --> 01:20:40.807
You have a real partner in life,

01:20:40.808 --> 01:20:42.375
and what does she want from you?

01:20:42.376 --> 01:20:45.376
"Take me to the waterfall."
But, no, you can't take her

01:20:45.813 --> 01:20:48.814
because you had some over-stimulated
snorkeling experience.

01:20:49.017 --> 01:20:50.451
Do you think when your marriage is over

01:20:50.452 --> 01:20:51.886
that you're gonna find somebody

01:20:51.887 --> 01:20:53.287
that just caters to you, no matter what?

01:20:53.288 --> 01:20:54.555
That you're not gonna
have to work at it?

01:20:54.556 --> 01:20:57.325
That's gonna be, like, psyched to go to
Applebee's with you every Friday night

01:20:57.326 --> 01:20:58.559
and hear the same football stories

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.062
about how you rocked in high school?

01:21:00.063 --> 01:21:02.964
I did rock in high school
football. You want to check tape?

01:21:02.965 --> 01:21:05.233
But whoever that person is, you
have to listen to their stories, too,

01:21:05.234 --> 01:21:07.302
or they're not gonna go
to Applebee's with you.

01:21:07.303 --> 01:21:09.504
You're not gonna have someone
to go to Applebee's with.

01:21:09.505 --> 01:21:12.506
You'll be sitting by yourself,
eventually, at Applebee's, all alone.

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:16.510
And who wants to go to
Applebee's by themselves?

01:21:17.214 --> 01:21:18.715
You know what? If anyone
should be mad here, guys,

01:21:18.716 --> 01:21:19.982
it should be me.

01:21:19.983 --> 01:21:22.983
I am having a real fight with my
wife, okay? And it's not a fun feeling.

01:21:24.222 --> 01:21:26.423
Look it. I'm talking in
circles. I'm on an island.

01:21:26.424 --> 01:21:28.325
I'm getting island fever now.
I'm starting to lose my mind.

01:21:28.326 --> 01:21:30.361
This is an early sign of things to come.

01:21:30.362 --> 01:21:33.362
And what we need to do now is get
focused and stop pointing fingers.

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:36.432
You're a problem. You're
a real, real problem.

01:21:41.207 --> 01:21:43.742
Is that Salvadore?

01:21:43.743 --> 01:21:46.743
Does this guy think he's a
mermaid? What is his deal?

01:21:48.949 --> 01:21:51.917
Oh. Please, excuse my nudity.

01:21:51.918 --> 01:21:54.918
I was expecting no company.

01:21:54.955 --> 01:21:57.955
Allow me to put something on.

01:21:58.925 --> 01:22:00.193
I would have asked you to join me,

01:22:00.194 --> 01:22:03.194
but the water is a little chilly.

01:22:04.599 --> 01:22:07.567
But perhaps this will
warm up the evening.

01:22:07.568 --> 01:22:09.136
And what is that?

01:22:09.137 --> 01:22:12.138
It's an island rum, infused with
the essence of the coconut fruit.

01:22:13.776 --> 01:22:15.309
Delicious.

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:17.478
Yes? You like? Very much.

01:22:17.479 --> 01:22:18.946
Yes.

01:22:18.947 --> 01:22:20.381
That's yummy.

01:22:20.382 --> 01:22:21.582
It is yummy.

01:22:21.583 --> 01:22:22.950
It's yummy, yummy, yummy, isn't it?

01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:24.453
Mmm. Yes.

01:22:24.454 --> 01:22:25.554
Oh, oh...

01:22:25.555 --> 01:22:27.756
Slow down there, killer.

01:22:27.757 --> 01:22:30.757
You see, this island has
so many healing curiosities.

01:22:31.494 --> 01:22:34.494
You know, it is good to have
a drink and have a good time.

01:22:36.233 --> 01:22:39.233
Then do it!

01:22:43.641 --> 01:22:45.241
Well, I guess we just go around, huh?

01:22:45.242 --> 01:22:47.011
No, we gotta go through. The path ends.

01:22:47.012 --> 01:22:48.779
We go off the path,
we get lost+ Come on.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.147
No, hey, we'll make a new path.

01:22:50.148 --> 01:22:52.817
What if there's people in there? Joey!

01:22:54.753 --> 01:22:56.253
Be careful, sweetie.

01:22:56.254 --> 01:22:59.255
Ronnie, I'm Cynthia. I'm always careful!

01:23:00.026 --> 01:23:01.326
Yes!

01:23:01.327 --> 01:23:04.327
Okay.

01:23:05.198 --> 01:23:06.331
Okay.

01:23:06.332 --> 01:23:09.332
Get in there. You,re
leaving fingerprints!

01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:12.171
I don't know what you're doing...

01:23:12.172 --> 01:23:14.640
Get away from the door.

01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:17.276
Jessie is a friend

01:23:17.277 --> 01:23:20.277
Yeah, I know he's been
A good friend of mine

01:23:20.881 --> 01:23:23.882
But lately something's changed
That ain't hard to define

01:23:24.552 --> 01:23:27.552
Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine

01:23:28.389 --> 01:23:31.389
And she's watching him with those eyes

01:23:31.726 --> 01:23:34.727
And she's loving him with
that body I just know it

01:23:35.464 --> 01:23:38.464
And he's holding her in
his arms late Late at night

01:23:40.002 --> 01:23:41.903
You know,..

01:23:41.904 --> 01:23:44.739
Hey! What are you doing here?

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.741
Private staff quarters are
strictly off limits to hotel guests!

01:23:48.245 --> 01:23:51.245
I'm so sorry that we are disturbing
your fortress of solitude here.

01:23:53.083 --> 01:23:56.083
I'm going to have to ask you to
leave The Ponderosa immediately.

01:23:56.386 --> 01:23:58.989
Well, that's a shame, because
the place is so inviting.

01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:00.991
When does Hoss and Little Joe show up?

01:24:00.992 --> 01:24:02.325
Dave.

01:24:02.326 --> 01:24:05.326
You gentlemen have
broken into The Ponderosa

01:24:05.596 --> 01:24:08.098
and have broken the
rules of this island.

01:24:08.099 --> 01:24:11.100
And, unfortunately, I don't think
you're gonna like the consequences.

01:24:13.772 --> 01:24:15.606
I'm gonna call monsieur Marcel.

01:24:15.607 --> 01:24:17.008
No, no, no, no, no, no. Sctanley,

01:24:17.009 --> 01:24:18.342
there's been a big misunderstanding.

01:24:18.343 --> 01:24:20.244
Some of us don't
necessarily want to be here.

01:24:20.245 --> 01:24:22.948
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, but
you've broken the rules

01:24:22.949 --> 01:24:24.716
and there are consequences.

01:24:24.717 --> 01:24:27.717
Yes, could you get
Marcel for me, please?

01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:30.854
Yes, I know he's asleep, but wake
him. This is important. I'll hold.

01:24:32.191 --> 01:24:33.860
What a shocker that
this went bad. Thank you.

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:35.962
Came here for answers and
now I'm not gonna get them!

01:24:35.963 --> 01:24:37.263
Great.

01:24:37.264 --> 01:24:39.198
Great leading, Joey. Me?

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.400
Yeah, you.

01:24:40.401 --> 01:24:43.401
I thought monsieur Marcel felt
that technology was a distraction.

01:24:44.305 --> 01:24:45.806
For the guests, yeah.

01:24:45.807 --> 01:24:47.207
You seem pretty good at that game.

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.243
He's the best on the whole island.

01:24:49.244 --> 01:24:51.946
It's a pretty small island.

01:24:51.947 --> 01:24:54.947
Doesn't look like it's all that hard.

01:24:57.753 --> 01:25:00.155
Looks like all you gotta
do is push these big buttons

01:25:00.156 --> 01:25:03.156
and play along with the
song here. Am I right?

01:25:03.659 --> 01:25:06.659
Something like that.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.800
You know what'd be a gas,
Sctanley? For me and you to play.

01:25:13.303 --> 01:25:14.804
And when I win,

01:25:14.805 --> 01:25:17.805
you could point me towards the singles'
side and forget you ever saw us.

01:25:19.476 --> 01:25:22.477
When you beat me?

01:25:31.689 --> 01:25:34.690
When I win, what will you give me?

01:25:35.594 --> 01:25:38.594
Maybe just this.

01:25:39.331 --> 01:25:42.331
$1,000
- A cool G, as we call it back home.

01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:44.669
Are you at liberty to
play for that, Sctanley?

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:47.671
Or would you prefer to play for smiles?

01:25:49.509 --> 01:25:52.509
Monsieur Marcel, I'm
sorry to have woken you.

01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:55.447
I thought there was an
emergency, but I was mistaken.

01:25:55.448 --> 01:25:57.717
I do apologize.

01:26:03.457 --> 01:26:06.457
I play at expert level.

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.632
You take this kind of serious.

01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:19.071
That's a big screen.

01:26:30.253 --> 01:26:31.753
You've played this before.

01:26:31.754 --> 01:26:34.755
Maybe just a couple times, Sctanley.

01:26:35.392 --> 01:26:38.392
All right, Sctanley,
let's have some fun.

01:26:48.273 --> 01:26:49.907
Come on, Sctanley, get him!

01:26:49.908 --> 01:26:51.108
Don't let him get in your head.

01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:54.109
Don't let him get in your head, Dave.

01:27:05.424 --> 01:27:07.258
I know a place you will like.

01:27:07.259 --> 01:27:10.129
Really? Yes. You will love it.

01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:13.032
What kind of place?

01:27:13.033 --> 01:27:14.633
Like a place that has dancing?

01:27:14.634 --> 01:27:16.435
There is everything. Everything?

01:27:16.436 --> 01:27:18.137
Oh, my God, you guys,
I want to go dancing!

01:27:18.138 --> 01:27:20.140
You want to go? Yes, please, regard me.

01:27:20.141 --> 01:27:22.075
Follow me. Oh, my God,
yeah, I want to go!

01:27:22.076 --> 01:27:23.477
It'll be a girls' night!

01:27:23.478 --> 01:27:24.611
Okay, but, honey, honey,
honey... Oh, my God.

01:27:24.612 --> 01:27:26.246
You should just slow down
here for a second maybe?

01:27:26.247 --> 01:27:29.247
That's exactly what I need!

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.280
It's the second guitar solo
that sorts the men from the boys.

01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:02.519
I was kind of counting
on that, Sctan. Joey?

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.653
Yeah?

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:06.654
I think it's time to
show the donkey the snake.

01:28:08.026 --> 01:28:10.294
Cut his head, cut his
head, cut his head!

01:28:10.295 --> 01:28:11.929
Go, go, go!

01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:14.930
Dave! Dave! Cut his head!

01:28:15.367 --> 01:28:18.367
Big finish.

01:28:21.274 --> 01:28:24.274
Star power! Star power! Yes!

01:28:25.111 --> 01:28:28.111
Sctanley, no!

01:28:35.455 --> 01:28:38.455
Yeah!

01:28:39.393 --> 01:28:40.560
You hustled me.

01:28:40.561 --> 01:28:43.562
Yes, I did.

01:28:43.965 --> 01:28:46.965
For that, I'm sorry. You see,
I sell video games, Sctanley.

01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:51.738
And this one here, in
particular, in fact.

01:28:51.739 --> 01:28:54.141
And I'm proud to stand here before you

01:28:54.142 --> 01:28:56.878
and tell you it brings
me as much happiness

01:28:56.879 --> 01:28:59.547
as it does for the
people I provide them to.

01:28:59.548 --> 01:29:02.548
And we had a bet, and I know
that you're a man of your word.

01:29:06.088 --> 01:29:07.823
Forget that you saw me and my friends

01:29:07.824 --> 01:29:10.824
and point me in the
direction that I seek.

01:29:12.596 --> 01:29:15.596
I cannot confirm or deny that the one
that you seek is on the singles' side.

01:29:18.068 --> 01:29:21.069
But a bet is a bet. And I
will tell you how to get there.

01:29:23.407 --> 01:29:26.407
The beach is blocked by rocks.
It's completely impassable.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.611
No more boats for me and
my friends. I go by foot.

01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:33.017
I would be remiss if I did not
advise you to wait until daylight.

01:29:33.018 --> 01:29:34.585
Do not take this journey lightly.

01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:35.920
Hmm.

01:29:35.921 --> 01:29:37.889
There is an old game
path through the forest,

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:40.124
just beyond the abandoned Starbucks.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.126
Take it to where it forks. Jog to
the right. Do not go to the left.

01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:49.132
You will see lights. You
don't want to go there.

01:29:52.705 --> 01:29:53.972
Keep walking.

01:29:53.973 --> 01:29:56.974
Look up and locate the
belt of Orion the Hunter.

01:29:57.578 --> 01:29:59.078
I think we should be writing this down.

01:29:59.079 --> 01:30:00.480
I think Dave's got it.

01:30:00.481 --> 01:30:02.582
The stars shall be your guide.

01:30:02.583 --> 01:30:05.418
As long as we're headed east, that's
the direction we're supposed to be going.

01:30:05.419 --> 01:30:06.654
I'm looking for the Little Dipper.

01:30:06.655 --> 01:30:08.656
If I could find the Little Dipper,
I could find the North Star.

01:30:08.657 --> 01:30:09.990
Shane, help me find the Little Dipper.

01:30:09.991 --> 01:30:11.458
What do I look like, Harriet Tubman?

01:30:11.459 --> 01:30:13.060
Fine! I'll do it by myself, okay?

01:30:13.061 --> 01:30:15.429
You guys are no help! Just... Just...

01:30:18.834 --> 01:30:20.001
Welcome to Hump Island!

01:30:20.002 --> 01:30:23.002
It's time to feast here in the
belly of the beast here at Eden East!

01:30:24.507 --> 01:30:26.942
Now can you feel it? Come on!

01:30:26.943 --> 01:30:29.344
Man, we are about to get
this party started right!

01:30:29.345 --> 01:30:31.080
You guys ready?

01:30:34.017 --> 01:30:35.351
Bingo!

01:30:35.352 --> 01:30:36.852
Hey, yo, check it out, y'all!

01:30:36.853 --> 01:30:39.422
A luau fire and drum show
is coming up real soon!

01:30:39.423 --> 01:30:41.157
Some of the best drummers
in the whole world.

01:30:41.158 --> 01:30:42.526
Don't forget to check it out!

01:30:42.527 --> 01:30:44.127
This place is out of control.

01:30:44.128 --> 01:30:46.096
What could she be possibly
getting into over here, man?

01:30:46.097 --> 01:30:47.698
Come on, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

01:30:47.699 --> 01:30:48.865
For all we know, she could be sitting

01:30:48.866 --> 01:30:50.300
in a corner sulking somewhere.

01:30:50.301 --> 01:30:53.301
Hey, we can do this. We get in, we
get out, we're back before sunrise.

01:30:53.539 --> 01:30:56.539
I know... I know that girl. San Diego!

01:30:57.710 --> 01:30:59.377
I know that girl. I'm gonna go see

01:30:59.378 --> 01:31:00.678
if I can get some answers out of her.

01:31:00.679 --> 01:31:02.547
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!

01:31:02.548 --> 01:31:04.515
Talking to locals is the
best way to get information!

01:31:04.516 --> 01:31:05.718
You guys should be doing it, too.

01:31:05.719 --> 01:31:06.852
That's a great idea. We split up.

01:31:06.853 --> 01:31:08.354
That way, we find her twice
as fast. Shane, with me.

01:31:08.355 --> 01:31:09.822
We shouldn't split up,
we should stay together.

01:31:09.823 --> 01:31:11.390
Listen, Dave, time is
of the essence, okay,

01:31:11.391 --> 01:31:13.158
and if we don't find
her, here's what else.

01:31:13.159 --> 01:31:15.527
We meet back at the exit in,
like, an hour, okay? Come on.

01:31:15.528 --> 01:31:16.895
Let's go. Jason, there's
a ton of people here.

01:31:16.896 --> 01:31:18.732
If we split up, we're
gonna... Stay with Joey.

01:31:18.733 --> 01:31:19.899
This place rocks.

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.001
What are you doing?

01:31:21.002 --> 01:31:22.402
What am I doing? I'm
trying to have a good time.

01:31:22.403 --> 01:31:24.871
I'm trying to have a party going on. Hi.

01:31:24.872 --> 01:31:26.473
Hi. Hi.

01:31:26.474 --> 01:31:27.640
Hi.

01:31:27.641 --> 01:31:29.176
We gotta find Trudy. I
don't want to get into this.

01:31:29.177 --> 01:31:31.245
Come on, buddy.

01:31:31.246 --> 01:31:33.247
What, are you dying to be
part of the new singles scene?

01:31:33.248 --> 01:31:35.149
Look at all these people.
They're running around, they're...

01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:38.052
They're sexting, they're krumping,
they're twatting each other

01:31:38.053 --> 01:31:40.321
'cause their day's so special they
have to share it with the world.

01:31:40.322 --> 01:31:42.190
It's called tweeting.
I call it twatting!

01:31:42.191 --> 01:31:43.925
Look, Joey, we were
single. We had our fun.

01:31:43.926 --> 01:31:45.160
We're not missing out on anything.

01:31:45.161 --> 01:31:46.762
No, you were single, you had fun.

01:31:46.763 --> 01:31:49.097
I got married early, so I
never got to experience this.

01:31:49.098 --> 01:31:51.867
I have a feeling you had a chance
to experience lots of things.

01:31:51.868 --> 01:31:54.370
But, look, if you want to
go play "Guess Your Disease"

01:31:54.371 --> 01:31:56.873
or "Let Me Translate Your Tribal
Tattoo," knock yourself out.

01:31:56.874 --> 01:31:59.108
You don't get it. I'm here
trapped on an island with a woman

01:31:59.109 --> 01:32:00.343
who can't even stand the sight of me.

01:32:00.344 --> 01:32:02.111
And whose fault is
that? It's not my fault!

01:32:02.112 --> 01:32:03.846
Dude, relationships
are a two-way street,

01:32:03.847 --> 01:32:05.416
not a highway and a bike path.

01:32:05.417 --> 01:32:07.017
If it matters to you, work at it.

01:32:07.018 --> 01:32:08.585
And if it doesn't, then don't!

01:32:08.586 --> 01:32:10.187
But make a decision.

01:32:10.188 --> 01:32:11.622
I want to be married

01:32:11.623 --> 01:32:14.623
'cause I want to have people
I can share my life with.

01:32:16.394 --> 01:32:19.395
I don't wanna be doing
this. I know what I want.

01:32:21.967 --> 01:32:24.967
I want it... Look. Hey, Dave, it's
not 'cause I don't want it, okay?

01:32:26.138 --> 01:32:29.139
You make the best of your
situation! My situation's to party!

01:32:31.111 --> 01:32:33.412
Yeah!

01:32:33.413 --> 01:32:34.480
Yeah, definitely.

01:32:34.481 --> 01:32:37.481
San Diego!

01:32:37.584 --> 01:32:39.318
Remember me? Where have you been?

01:32:39.319 --> 01:32:41.388
Where have I been? I've
been trying to get here!

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.656
Look, we'll never be able to find her.

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:45.292
If... If I walk over there,
she's gonna walk over here.

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:47.094
If I'm on this side, she's
probably gonna be on that side!

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:49.796
All right, panicking's
not gonna help, Shane.

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:51.932
Hey, want to dance, tough guy?

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:54.635
No, I'd step on your feet, I'd
hurt you. Thank you, though.

01:32:54.636 --> 01:32:57.636
All right, now, everybody up,
everybody up! This is Eden East!

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.440
This place is amazing! I can't
believe they kept this from us!

01:33:02.244 --> 01:33:03.344
I knew you would love it.

01:33:03.345 --> 01:33:05.614
This is why I brought
you here. Vitality!

01:33:05.615 --> 01:33:08.350
Oh, it is so nice to be
out with lots of people!

01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:11.186
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?

01:33:11.187 --> 01:33:14.187
It's great. In a couple more
minutes, I'll just roofie myself.

01:33:14.324 --> 01:33:17.026
I will go get my special
Salvadore drink, yes?

01:33:17.027 --> 01:33:18.328
Oh, yes.

01:33:18.329 --> 01:33:19.929
"Guess I am on my way."

01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:21.498
"Mighty glad you stayed!"

01:33:21.499 --> 01:33:24.499
Yes! Yes!

01:33:25.436 --> 01:33:27.036
He is so much fun!

01:33:27.037 --> 01:33:28.639
Oh, God, don't even start.

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:30.207
I'm just having fun.

01:33:30.208 --> 01:33:32.309
No, it's just... Guys, this is too much.

01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:33.944
What's too much? Let's
just get it together

01:33:33.945 --> 01:33:36.945
and chill out a little.

01:33:41.954 --> 01:33:44.954
Excuse me, I don't mean to
disturb you. My name's Dave.

01:33:45.458 --> 01:33:46.725
Hi. Ronnie.

01:33:46.726 --> 01:33:48.560
Ronnie. That's a great name.

01:33:48.561 --> 01:33:49.961
Thank you. Yeah.

01:33:49.962 --> 01:33:51.731
Do you have a cell phone I could use?

01:33:51.732 --> 01:33:53.032
Why?

01:33:53.033 --> 01:33:56.033
Someone's got to call God and let
him know one of his angels is missing.

01:33:56.637 --> 01:33:59.539
Wow, that is the worst
line I've ever heard.

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:00.673
Well, what do you want from me?

01:34:00.674 --> 01:34:02.074
I've been out of the game for a while.

01:34:02.075 --> 01:34:05.076
I've been slumming it
with a really hot redhead.

01:34:05.346 --> 01:34:06.747
Now you're getting closer.

01:34:06.748 --> 01:34:08.982
Dave, if you're here to be
an olive branch for Jason,

01:34:08.983 --> 01:34:11.585
I am not gonna talk about it tonight.

01:34:11.586 --> 01:34:12.920
I'm not here to talk about anything,

01:34:12.921 --> 01:34:15.922
I just want to see my wife. Let's go.

01:34:17.927 --> 01:34:19.994
I can't just leave these two.

01:34:19.995 --> 01:34:22.995
I think they'll survive.

01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:27.834
We sure will.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.675
They are so lucky.

01:34:34.177 --> 01:34:37.177
Now this next jam goes out to
all you party people in the house!

01:34:38.682 --> 01:34:41.683
Everybody, up! Let's keep
this party going, y'all!

01:34:41.786 --> 01:34:43.186
Maybe we ought to wait by the exit,

01:34:43.187 --> 01:34:44.788
so when people come out, you know...

01:34:44.789 --> 01:34:45.922
Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast.

01:34:45.923 --> 01:34:48.923
I gotta get back, gotta
find my wife, you know?

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:52.061
What do you got? You see her?

01:34:53.565 --> 01:34:56.565
That's my wife.

01:34:56.635 --> 01:34:58.970
Jennifer?

01:34:58.971 --> 01:35:01.971
Shane?

01:35:03.042 --> 01:35:06.042
God, Shane, there you are! I've
been looking all over for you.

01:35:07.447 --> 01:35:08.947
Jennifer, what are you doing here?

01:35:08.948 --> 01:35:11.948
Look, I heard at the salon that you were
coming to this crazy singles' island,

01:35:13.219 --> 01:35:16.220
so I just felt a strong sense of urgency

01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:19.158
that you and l needed to
talk before it was too late.

01:35:19.159 --> 01:35:20.893
Jennifer, you left me, remember?

01:35:20.894 --> 01:35:23.329
I know, I know.

01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:26.232
But then I was hoping that
you would come after me.

01:35:26.233 --> 01:35:29.234
It wasn't like you walked out
of a bar! It was a divorce.

01:35:29.471 --> 01:35:30.904
And why are you even at this place?

01:35:30.905 --> 01:35:33.007
Do you know this place is insane?

01:35:33.008 --> 01:35:34.575
I'm getting called names.

01:35:34.576 --> 01:35:37.576
I've been called a cougar,
a black panther, a puma!

01:35:38.013 --> 01:35:40.081
I had to smack this one kid.

01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:43.082
That's the last time he'll walk
up to a woman talking about cougar!

01:35:43.653 --> 01:35:44.753
Yeah.

01:35:44.754 --> 01:35:46.454
I've been looking all
over the place for you.

01:35:46.455 --> 01:35:47.689
And where have you been?

01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:50.459
Well, actually, I'm
staying on the other side,

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.162
the couples' side, with my girlfriend.

01:35:53.163 --> 01:35:56.163
What? Who?

01:35:56.433 --> 01:35:59.433
Her name is Trudy and she's
aspiring to be a manager.

01:36:01.338 --> 01:36:03.807
Put it in my mouth!

01:36:03.808 --> 01:36:06.209
Go, go, go!

01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:07.511
Trudy?

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:10.180
All right, y'all, it's
almost time for the mele,

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:13.181
the Kanikapila luau drum show!

01:36:13.718 --> 01:36:15.787
The special blend.

01:36:15.788 --> 01:36:17.455
Yes, this is a magical drink.

01:36:17.456 --> 01:36:18.556
You know what?

01:36:18.557 --> 01:36:21.326
I'm gonna go get a good spot for
the show. Do you guys wanna come?

01:36:21.327 --> 01:36:22.727
No, no, we're good here.

01:36:22.728 --> 01:36:25.063
Okay. You're fine? Okay.

01:36:25.064 --> 01:36:27.399
And then there was two.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.568
Listen, I want you to come back with me.

01:36:29.569 --> 01:36:31.804
I'm not going back to
the other side with you.

01:36:31.805 --> 01:36:34.406
I'm gonna stay right
here, get my celebration on

01:36:34.407 --> 01:36:36.709
and get another margarita
made up in my face.

01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:38.845
I came a long way to find you.

01:36:38.846 --> 01:36:40.547
Well, I know you ain't
come to get a drink.

01:36:40.548 --> 01:36:42.182
You damn sure ain't come to dance.

01:36:42.183 --> 01:36:43.316
So what'd you follow me here for?

01:36:43.317 --> 01:36:44.384
No. I did.

01:36:44.385 --> 01:36:47.385
I came here to drink, party,
scratch records, do it all!

01:36:47.521 --> 01:36:50.522
Do it... It's just...
Just... Just... You know?

01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:56.161
What am I saying?

01:36:56.431 --> 01:36:59.333
I don't want to do any of those things.

01:37:00.869 --> 01:37:03.870
Truth is that I'm
exhausted just saying them.

01:37:04.907 --> 01:37:07.907
All right, y'all, it's time for
the Kanikapila luau drum show!

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.282
Cynthia, hi. Excuse me. Hi.

01:37:13.283 --> 01:37:14.684
Hi. Hey, what are you doing here?

01:37:14.685 --> 01:37:15.785
You all right?

01:37:15.786 --> 01:37:17.687
I'm fine, Jason. I'm watching the show.

01:37:17.688 --> 01:37:20.223
We do have to get back before
sunrise, though. Let's get a move on.

01:37:20.224 --> 01:37:21.357
I don't think that's a good idea, Jason.

01:37:21.358 --> 01:37:22.425
Come on, hon. Let's go.

01:37:22.426 --> 01:37:23.559
We're very close.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.561
Jason, I'm not going anywhere.

01:37:26.965 --> 01:37:29.965
It pains me to say this,
but I gotta let you go.

01:37:32.771 --> 01:37:34.138
I love you.

01:37:34.139 --> 01:37:37.140
But we cannot do this to
each other anymore. It's over.

01:37:39.311 --> 01:37:41.913
It's over.

01:37:41.914 --> 01:37:44.482
Daddy, wait. I was wrong.
I don't want to lose you.

01:37:44.483 --> 01:37:46.151
I'll go back to the other side.

01:37:46.152 --> 01:37:48.820
No. Then you... You,d
be doing what I did.

01:37:48.821 --> 01:37:51.822
Trying to be something that you're not.

01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:54.958
You're 20. Go be 20.

01:37:58.665 --> 01:38:01.067
All right?

01:38:05.773 --> 01:38:08.773
I will not lose you. All
right? I cannot lose you.

01:38:10.077 --> 01:38:11.778
You're the whole reason that I'm here.

01:38:11.779 --> 01:38:13.581
You're the whole reason
that I've done all of this.

01:38:13.582 --> 01:38:16.582
You're the whole reason that I've
made a complete ass out of myself.

01:38:19.154 --> 01:38:22.154
I have failed here miserably.
And that does not bother me.

01:38:25.028 --> 01:38:26.962
What bothers me is
that I have failed you

01:38:26.963 --> 01:38:29.765
and I am not gonna do that ever again.

01:38:29.766 --> 01:38:32.766
All right? I love you a lot.

01:38:39.477 --> 01:38:42.477
Let's go get a drink.

01:38:46.383 --> 01:38:48.686
Oh.

01:38:48.687 --> 01:38:51.687
Honey, it has been forever
since we did something like this.

01:38:53.225 --> 01:38:55.693
Yeah.

01:38:55.694 --> 01:38:58.694
You know, baby, it's funny. Since
we've been here, it's like the therapist

01:38:58.997 --> 01:39:01.566
and the place has made
it like we got a problem.

01:39:01.567 --> 01:39:04.567
But you know what? I think
we don't have a problem.

01:39:05.671 --> 01:39:06.738
No.

01:39:06.739 --> 01:39:09.574
We got a million problems.

01:39:09.575 --> 01:39:11.076
Really? Yeah.

01:39:11.077 --> 01:39:14.078
But, honey, I think everybody
has a million problems.

01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:16.415
I don't know that, like, you,re
supposed to solve them all,

01:39:16.416 --> 01:39:19.416
because the simple truth of it,
sweetheart, is we're married.

01:39:20.153 --> 01:39:23.153
We made a commitment to each
other and to our families.

01:39:23.925 --> 01:39:26.925
And to myself. And I meant it.

01:39:27.529 --> 01:39:28.929
Shane, honey, wait.

01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:30.864
Jennifer, I don't need this.

01:39:30.865 --> 01:39:32.566
I'm done with trying
to make you like me.

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:34.701
I'm not gonna be the
man you want me to be.

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:37.205
I'm not gonna do things the
way you want me to do things.

01:39:37.206 --> 01:39:40.206
I'm always gonna wear my heart on
my sleeve because that's who I am.

01:39:40.376 --> 01:39:42.210
And I got a lot of friends that like me

01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:44.846
just because I'm the way I am.

01:39:44.847 --> 01:39:47.848
But it really doesn't
matter because I like me.

01:39:50.954 --> 01:39:52.721
Well, I don't like you.

01:39:52.722 --> 01:39:55.722
Whatever. I love you.

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:59.529
I can't stand picking out tiles.

01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:02.299
It drives me nuts to try
to redo the fricking house.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.967
I know it does.

01:40:03.968 --> 01:40:06.436
But, you know, the one thing
that we can and should always do

01:40:06.437 --> 01:40:09.437
is just kind of have
fun with each other.

01:40:09.907 --> 01:40:12.643
And truthfully, sweetheart, that
should be the easiest thing to do

01:40:12.644 --> 01:40:14.278
because before there was the kids

01:40:14.279 --> 01:40:17.279
or the house or the job or any of it,

01:40:17.816 --> 01:40:19.116
there was just you.

01:40:19.117 --> 01:40:20.818
And I love you, Ronnie.

01:40:20.819 --> 01:40:23.820
I love you, too, Dave.

01:40:31.965 --> 01:40:34.965
Hey, now, all you naughty boys and
girls, gather 'round, gather 'round.

01:40:37.271 --> 01:40:39.439
The hell's she doing here?

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.506
Who?

01:40:40.507 --> 01:40:43.507
That's my wife. She
must be looking for me.

01:40:43.777 --> 01:40:46.346
I don't think so. She looks fine.

01:40:46.347 --> 01:40:49.348
You should just relax.

01:40:50.485 --> 01:40:53.485
Son of a...

01:40:56.191 --> 01:40:59.192
Excuse me!

01:40:59.362 --> 01:41:00.695
Hey!

01:41:00.696 --> 01:41:03.098
Peacock!

01:41:03.099 --> 01:41:06.099
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

01:41:08.804 --> 01:41:11.273
"Encouragement!" Joey!

01:41:11.274 --> 01:41:12.708
Baby, remember when we first met

01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:15.709
and I told you that you were
the only man I'd ever been with?

01:41:15.979 --> 01:41:17.480
You lied? No, no, no, no, no.

01:41:17.481 --> 01:41:20.481
I was... I was completely inexperienced,

01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:23.553
and, honey, I didn't
know what I had in you.

01:41:23.554 --> 01:41:24.821
I've been cheating on you!

01:41:24.822 --> 01:41:26.890
I've been cheating on
you every chance I got!

01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:28.225
Yeah? For years, I've
been cheating on you.

01:41:28.226 --> 01:41:30.727
Well, I cheated on you
with more than one guy!

01:41:30.728 --> 01:41:32.996
With two... You had a
three-way with two dudes?

01:41:32.997 --> 01:41:34.465
No, no! But I would have!

01:41:34.466 --> 01:41:37.068
I totally would have!
Well, I would've, too!

01:41:37.069 --> 01:41:39.070
Not with two dudes! You
know what I'm talking about!

01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:42.071
I thought I needed to know what it
was like out there, in a real way,

01:41:42.408 --> 01:41:45.408
not like I read it in Cosmo. So
I went out there and I lived it.

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.180
I've had one-night stands!

01:41:48.181 --> 01:41:49.248
Okay.

01:41:49.249 --> 01:41:51.250
I've woken up in beds with men

01:41:51.251 --> 01:41:53.252
whose names I didn't even remember!

01:41:53.253 --> 01:41:54.920
I was like, "'How did
l get this T-shirt on?,'

01:41:54.921 --> 01:41:56.722
Jennifer, I get it. Land your plane.

01:41:56.723 --> 01:41:58.090
Just deal with it! You deal with it.

01:41:58.091 --> 01:42:00.393
You deal... You deal with
going to Applebee's alone.

01:42:00.394 --> 01:42:02.162
What? If you don't put in effort,

01:42:02.163 --> 01:42:04.764
you're gonna be the one who
ends up at Applebee's alone.

01:42:04.765 --> 01:42:06.833
Are you asking me to go
to Applebee's with you?

01:42:06.834 --> 01:42:08.935
The bottom line is that none of them

01:42:08.936 --> 01:42:11.872
made me feel the love that you did.

01:42:11.873 --> 01:42:14.709
And I had to go out into the world

01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:17.710
in order for me to come back
and say that I belong home.

01:42:17.779 --> 01:42:20.181
Now I'm gonna keep on
spinning these fly tunes

01:42:20.182 --> 01:42:22.551
until somebody gets something going on!

01:42:22.552 --> 01:42:24.286
I'm not saying I wouldn't
go to Applebee's with you!

01:42:24.287 --> 01:42:26.088
Well, I'm not saying I wouldn't
go to Applebee's with you!

01:42:26.089 --> 01:42:27.789
All right, well, I would try
to go to Applebee's with you.

01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:29.024
Well, I would try to go
to Applebee's with you!

01:42:29.025 --> 01:42:32.025
So let's try. I want
to try! Well, let's try!

01:42:33.964 --> 01:42:36.964
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:42:38.936 --> 01:42:41.936
I am so sorry that it took all of that.

01:42:44.308 --> 01:42:47.309
But you know what? Now I can
honestly say, with love in my heart'

01:42:48.446 --> 01:42:51.446
that you are my man.

01:42:53.051 --> 01:42:55.385
Could you ever love me again?

01:42:55.386 --> 01:42:58.387
Well, you're my wife.

01:42:58.491 --> 01:43:01.491
And I never stopped loving you.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.560
Now come here and give me a kiss.

01:43:07.399 --> 01:43:10.400
This next jam goes out to all
you party people in the house!

01:43:10.971 --> 01:43:12.104
And that time that you got sick,

01:43:12.105 --> 01:43:13.172
you didn't want me to see you,

01:43:13.173 --> 01:43:14.340
so you locked me out of the bathroom?

01:43:14.341 --> 01:43:16.142
No! Then I passed out!

01:43:16.143 --> 01:43:17.243
Yeah.

01:43:17.244 --> 01:43:18.310
And you called the ambulance.

01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:19.745
Well, because, before you passed out,

01:43:19.746 --> 01:43:21.113
it sounded like you were dying in there.

01:43:21.114 --> 01:43:22.282
You know? I thought I was dying. I did.

01:43:22.283 --> 01:43:23.450
Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?

01:43:23.451 --> 01:43:25.418
I should have broken down the door.

01:43:25.419 --> 01:43:27.420
You've been a really good friend.

01:43:27.421 --> 01:43:30.421
You have been the best
friend in the world to me.

01:43:31.759 --> 01:43:33.327
Now don't stop dancing, y'all!

01:43:33.328 --> 01:43:36.328
Party ain't over! It's far from over!

01:44:05.329 --> 01:44:08.329
Silence, please! Silence!

01:44:09.835 --> 01:44:12.835
I made a program for you and
you decided not to follow it.

01:44:14.005 --> 01:44:17.005
You defied my instructions
and you went off course.

01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:19.977
Why are we being held to a
different standard, Marcel?

01:44:19.978 --> 01:44:21.246
You weren't here on time this morning.

01:44:21.247 --> 01:44:24.247
I was here before
sunrise, sadly, by myself.

01:44:24.417 --> 01:44:27.352
Therefore, I chose not to wait.

01:44:27.353 --> 01:44:28.753
Marcel, I've got to be honest with you.

01:44:28.754 --> 01:44:29.855
You know... Silence!

01:44:29.856 --> 01:44:32.157
No, you silence! Please, just...

01:44:32.158 --> 01:44:35.159
I don't need some speech
about moments, okay?

01:44:36.096 --> 01:44:37.263
No more, okay?

01:44:37.264 --> 01:44:39.098
I'm sorry that we kept
you waiting this morning

01:44:39.099 --> 01:44:40.700
and that we didn't respect your program,

01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:43.102
but last night my wife and l,

01:44:43.103 --> 01:44:45.939
we spent some real time together,

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:47.574
and for the first time in a long time,

01:44:47.575 --> 01:44:50.043
we woke up actually very, very happy.

01:44:50.044 --> 01:44:52.112
So, with all due respect, sir,

01:44:52.113 --> 01:44:54.414
I don't need you, or
anyone else for that matter,

01:44:54.415 --> 01:44:57.416
to, you know, say anything, really.

01:44:57.953 --> 01:44:59.220
I know.

01:44:59.221 --> 01:45:00.288
Sorry?

01:45:00.289 --> 01:45:01.456
You do?

01:45:01.457 --> 01:45:04.457
Yes.

01:45:05.227 --> 01:45:08.228
That is why I am giving you this.

01:45:08.265 --> 01:45:10.199
I don't understand.

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.200
I could never reveal your
true inner animal spirit.

01:45:14.537 --> 01:45:17.373
It was always up to you.

01:45:17.374 --> 01:45:20.375
Cynthia, Jason, your
spirit is the rabbit.

01:45:22.713 --> 01:45:25.713
No matter what obstacles
are put in front of him,

01:45:25.783 --> 01:45:28.485
the rabbit will scrape and burrow

01:45:28.486 --> 01:45:31.486
and find a way to create his home.

01:45:33.825 --> 01:45:35.826
Thank you. Thank you.

01:45:35.827 --> 01:45:38.827
Lucy, Joseph.

01:45:39.164 --> 01:45:42.164
For you,

01:45:43.268 --> 01:45:44.970
the wolf.

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:47.971
The wolf is by nature a pack animal

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:50.442
and one of the few proud members

01:45:50.443 --> 01:45:53.443
of the animal kingdom
that mates for life.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.813
Congratulations.

01:45:54.814 --> 01:45:56.449
Thank you.

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:59.352
Hello, Jen. Welcome, Jennifer.

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:01.354
Thank you.

01:46:01.355 --> 01:46:04.355
For you,

01:46:04.625 --> 01:46:06.859
the noble honeybee.

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.862
The honeybee is committed.

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:11.863
And though it may fly
from flower to flower,

01:46:12.367 --> 01:46:15.336
collecting the sweet, sticky nectar'

01:46:15.337 --> 01:46:18.337
it has no choice but
to return to the hive.

01:46:19.508 --> 01:46:20.875
Congratulations.

01:46:20.876 --> 01:46:23.712
Thank you. That's a big-ass bee.

01:46:23.713 --> 01:46:25.947
Finally, Ronnie and David.

01:46:25.948 --> 01:46:28.883
I have thought long and hard about this.

01:46:28.884 --> 01:46:31.554
I could not decide with my mind.

01:46:31.555 --> 01:46:34.555
I had to open my soul
to the animal spirits.

01:46:35.325 --> 01:46:36.892
And, finally...

01:46:36.893 --> 01:46:38.661
Okay, the build-up's killing me.

01:46:38.662 --> 01:46:40.730
What do we got here? Two cheetahs?

01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:43.200
Couple of eagles? You got two lions?

01:46:43.201 --> 01:46:46.201
The ass.

01:46:46.404 --> 01:46:49.404
You are the ass.

01:46:50.308 --> 01:46:52.676
Stubborn and immovable.

01:46:52.677 --> 01:46:55.678
The mighty ass tirelessly bears
the heavy burden of others.

01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:01.250
But when the ass is on the
move, nothing can stop the ass.

01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:07.190
Be an ass for your marriage.
Be an ass for your children.

01:47:08.661 --> 01:47:11.397
Be an ass for love.

01:47:11.398 --> 01:47:14.398
Thank you, Marcel.

01:47:15.268 --> 01:47:18.268
I'm gonna be the biggest
ass you've ever seen.

01:47:21.776 --> 01:47:24.776
And now, you may spend the rest
of your trip enjoying the island.

01:47:26.347 --> 01:47:29.347
Please feel free to make Eden
into your own, personal Sandals.

01:47:31.186 --> 01:47:33.020
Yes.

01:47:33.021 --> 01:47:35.189
And now, jet skis!

01:47:35.190 --> 01:47:38.190
Yes, yes! Yes!

01:47:41.630 --> 01:47:43.198
Hey, hey, what's happening?

01:47:43.199 --> 01:47:44.966
I sure miss you guys.

01:47:44.967 --> 01:47:46.301
I miss you so much.

01:47:46.302 --> 01:47:49.302
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws!

01:47:49.906 --> 01:47:52.240
We get to eat all the candy we want!

01:47:52.241 --> 01:47:53.642
Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready!

01:47:53.643 --> 01:47:54.777
Come on! We're waiting on you!

01:47:54.778 --> 01:47:56.646
Give us one second with the
kids. We'll be there in a minute.

01:47:56.647 --> 01:47:57.814
Go ahead and start. Well, listen,

01:47:57.815 --> 01:48:00.049
when we get back next weekend,
we'll go to Medieval Times

01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:01.484
and we'll get some big drumsticks

01:48:01.485 --> 01:48:03.319
and lots of meat.
- Yes!

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.321
And we're gonna be doing a lot
more of that fun stuff, guys,

01:48:05.322 --> 01:48:07.091
so get ready, okay? I'm gonna take you

01:48:07.092 --> 01:48:08.492
to the school parking
lot, we'll do some donuts.

01:48:08.493 --> 01:48:09.726
Yeah! Donuts!

01:48:09.727 --> 01:48:10.828
All right, I love you.

01:48:10.829 --> 01:48:13.330
Love you, too. Here's Grandpa Jim Jim.

01:48:13.331 --> 01:48:15.666
All right. Enjoy your last few days.

01:48:15.667 --> 01:48:17.734
Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor

01:48:17.735 --> 01:48:19.971
and not give them candy
every time they ask?

01:48:19.972 --> 01:48:22.774
You ought to be thanking me.
I'm here at this home store

01:48:22.775 --> 01:48:25.775
returning some of the stuff
that you had on that house list.

01:48:25.845 --> 01:48:27.912
Okay, thanks so much. When you..
- When you look at the coating,

01:48:27.913 --> 01:48:29.614
will you beat that guy up on the price?

01:48:29.615 --> 01:48:32.251
Kevin! That is not a real toilet.

01:48:32.252 --> 01:48:33.986
Dad, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

01:48:33.987 --> 01:48:35.754
Please tell me he's
not peeing in the store.

01:48:35.755 --> 01:48:38.424
It's nice to take a
moment and just relax.

01:48:38.425 --> 01:48:39.658
Dad? I gotta go.

01:48:39.659 --> 01:48:42.195
I don't know him and there's
no way I'm going near him.

01:48:42.196 --> 01:48:45.196
Grandpa, there's no toilet paper.

01:48:47.869 --> 01:48:50.869
Help me get my shirt off.

01:53:14.892 --> 01:53:17.660
You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp.

01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:20.661
They want you to be in debt.

01:53:20.664 --> 01:53:23.132
That's how it works. They
give you these credit cards

01:53:23.133 --> 01:53:25.568
you can't pay for,

01:53:25.569 --> 01:53:28.570
HD, motorcycles. It's all a pimp game.
