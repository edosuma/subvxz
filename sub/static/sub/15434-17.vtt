WEBVTT

00:01.605 --> 00:03.140
William and Holly had a daughter.

00:03.175 --> 00:03.795
Oh, god.

00:03.830 --> 00:07.670
You could discover your father has
another child and not tell me?

00:07.705 --> 00:10.300
We want to use your sperm
to get julia pregnant.

00:10.335 --> 00:11.477
I'll help you, tommy.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.585
Fill out these forms.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.320
And we'll never know
which one of them it is?

00:15.355 --> 00:16.361
That's the plan.

00:16.398 --> 00:17.330
Are these your kids?

00:17.374 --> 00:20.161
That's jack. He's 8.
And sofia, she's 10.

00:20.203 --> 00:22.388
- I'm looking for holly harper.
- Do I know you?

00:22.411 --> 00:23.649
I'm her daughter rebecca.

00:23.689 --> 00:25.621
You said that bill was just your friend

00:25.665 --> 00:28.761
and just kinda left out the
part about him being my father?

00:28.797 --> 00:31.861
"We're getting a serious gay
vibe from the daytime doctor."

00:31.895 --> 00:33.002
We need to lay low.

00:33.046 --> 00:35.742
If you're expecting tears
from me, you can forget it.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.451
I don't expect anything.
I just wanted to meet you.

00:43.866 --> 00:48.292
"every morning, there were these few
precious milliseconds before reality set in,

00:48.325 --> 00:51.661
before dora remembered
where she was, who she was.

00:52.338 --> 00:55.041
Then it would all come flooding back.

00:55.375 --> 00:59.243
Each day seemed to bring
some new disturbing revelation,

00:59.768 --> 01:04.230
some bomb that would make her
reconsider her entire existence.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.458 --> 01:17.060
this last explosion had caused the most damage."

01:17.107 --> 01:21.680
Hey, ma, it's me. I just, uh, wanted
to tell you to turn on channel 7.

01:21.716 --> 01:24.540
They're doing a whole
tribute to Betty friedan.

01:24.578 --> 01:27.373
Anyway, I guess I'll,
um, talk to you soon. Bye.

01:27.407 --> 01:29.471
"Family dynamics were strained..."

01:29.508 --> 01:30.980
okay, here you go.

01:31.017 --> 01:32.661
That's it? Great. What,

01:32.698 --> 01:34.272
that's it? You're leaving?

01:34.315 --> 01:37.271
You barely stayed for three
signatures. How are you, kevin?

01:37.305 --> 01:38.893
I'm fine. I'm just a little busy, saul.

01:39.417 --> 01:42.382
"The fallout could be felt for miles."

01:45.256 --> 01:47.071
don't try you on your way out?

01:47.725 --> 01:49.582
Just trying to make conversation.

01:49.618 --> 01:51.323
Well, don't.

01:51.368 --> 01:54.330
You want to have some
eggs? They're mostly whites.

01:54.377 --> 01:57.911
"This last remaining surprise
had threatened to destroy

01:57.947 --> 02:01.583
a family she had never
been allowed to know

02:01.618 --> 02:03.953
dora's family."

02:12.935 --> 02:15.102
Well? What do you think ?

02:16.506 --> 02:17.213
Yeah.

02:17.256 --> 02:19.550
"Pedantic" comes to mind.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.341
What a soap opera. I
was waiting for, like,

02:22.386 --> 02:26.760
an evil twin to appear or for
someone to get amnesia or something.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.680
So what, you thought
it was over- the- top?

02:28.727 --> 02:30.582
I mean, this is coming
from a very real place.

02:30.616 --> 02:32.922
Relax, Dora. Don't get defensive.

02:32.957 --> 02:35.271
It's Nora, joel...

02:35.315 --> 02:39.351
and your story about incest at the
white house was not exactly subtle.

02:39.386 --> 02:40.452
- I mean, it didn't come from any
- nora.

02:40.487 --> 02:41.830
Yes?

02:41.878 --> 02:44.753
You seem to have a lot
to say, which is good.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.911
But you don't have to say
it all at the same time.

02:47.945 --> 02:49.983
You've packed a lot
of incidents in here,

02:50.016 --> 02:52.951
which makes it all a bit, uh...

02:53.286 --> 02:54.362
disconnected.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.341
Well, it's terrible then,
isn't it? It's terrible.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.321
No, it's not terrible,

02:58.367 --> 03:01.941
but it's the emotions behind
the incidents that matter.

03:01.975 --> 03:05.200
What are these people
feeling? What is... Dora...

03:05.648 --> 03:07.212
really going through?

03:07.247 --> 03:09.733
School sucks.

03:10.528 --> 03:14.543
I am going to make myself
a huge chocolate sundae

03:14.576 --> 03:16.873
and eat the whole thing,

03:16.918 --> 03:20.422
and then if I don't feel better
after that, I will drop out, too,

03:20.457 --> 03:23.011
right after I stick my
finger down my throat.

03:25.096 --> 03:28.420
Why are you using sarah's
knapsack from high school?

03:28.456 --> 03:30.472
I needed a book bag.

03:30.506 --> 03:33.081
Oh, look. It still has a Bob Marley badge on it.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.251
and I don't know it's such a good
idea after your little "incident"

03:36.286 --> 03:39.140
to be walking around with
a pot leaf on your bag, mom.

03:39.618 --> 03:41.320
She called again, by the way.

03:41.368 --> 03:43.000
Don't worry. I'll call her back.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.640
Good, because everyone's gonna
have to start talking at some point.

03:45.675 --> 03:48.021
- About what?
- About rebecca, mom.

03:48.068 --> 03:51.282
I mean, she's real. She exists. And you know
what? She lives, like, 20 minutes from us.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.501
What are you saying, that I should take a
bundt cake over there and introduce myself?

03:56.408 --> 03:59.262
I met her. I talked to her.

04:00.778 --> 04:02.183
You talked to her? About what?

04:02.228 --> 04:05.163
Well, things, I don't know. You know,
we...we...we hung out a few times.

04:05.197 --> 04:08.743
A few t...you hung out a few
times? I can't believe this.

04:08.787 --> 04:10.962
You can't get mad at me. You were the
one that said we should do what

04:10.998 --> 04:12.881
whatever we felt we needed
to do in this situation.

04:12.928 --> 04:16.522
So- so what you needed to do
was go hang out with her

04:16.555 --> 04:18.663
a few times without
tell...behind my back?

04:18.706 --> 04:22.012
- I knew you'd react like this.
- How do you expect me to react?

04:22.055 --> 04:24.872
My husband kept a daughter from
me, and now you hang out with her?

04:24.918 --> 04:27.702
Did you honestly think I
wouldn't meet her? She's my sister!

04:27.735 --> 04:29.481
Damn it, you already have sisters.

04:29.518 --> 04:31.951
She's not going away, mom.

04:31.996 --> 04:34.961
I mean, she's here whether
we like it or not, okay?

04:44.437 --> 04:46.810
Oh wow. More movies.

04:46.856 --> 04:49.742
I swear, since you decided
we can't be seen in public,

04:49.787 --> 04:52.642
you've driven up the
company's stock at least 20%.

04:53.205 --> 04:56.043
- Did you order "Dirty Harry"?
- Yeah, I never saw it.

04:56.446 --> 04:59.450
Wow, you really are
bisexual, aren't you?

05:00.337 --> 05:03.481
I guess we'll save "singin'
in the rain" for palm springs.

05:03.825 --> 05:07.141
Um, Kevin, about this weekend... 
- wha

05:07.175 --> 05:08.642
no, no, no, no!

05:08.688 --> 05:12.270
Come on, I've already made reservations
at the parker, and you already said yes.

05:12.308 --> 05:14.603
It's not that. Something came up.

05:14.646 --> 05:17.041
I have to go to this
premiere on saturday.

05:17.088 --> 05:21.982
it's a big director, and he's interested in me
for a movie. It's really important that I be there.

05:22.016 --> 05:24.420
And I suppose you're
taking your mom, right?

05:24.457 --> 05:25.870
- No.
- No.

05:25.915 --> 05:28.761
I'm taking a
friend...an actress.

05:28.808 --> 05:31.623
An actress. Great. Whose idea was that?

05:31.657 --> 05:33.362
- My manager's.
- Your manager.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.652
You do everything your manager says?

05:35.696 --> 05:37.601
Well, I'm here right
now, so I guess not.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.950
You know... you know, uh,

05:39.998 --> 05:42.931
I'm sorry, Chad, but I have
officially O. D. 'D on secrets.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.830
My family's imploding because of
secrets that wouldn't go away.

05:45.876 --> 05:48.831
So I tell you what, you know your
little friend, this little actress?

05:48.867 --> 05:51.201
Take her to the premiere,
but that's it, I'm sorry.

05:51.238 --> 05:53.542
That's- - that's my line
in the sand. We're done.

05:53.955 --> 05:55.773
Kevin?

05:55.818 --> 05:57.531
What?

05:57.576 --> 05:59.341
- You're right.
- About what?

06:02.827 --> 06:05.990
I can't live my
life like this anymore either.

06:08.648 --> 06:11.122
We'll go together.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.331
- Are you kidding?
- No.

06:13.377 --> 06:15.720
I'm about to go undercover on the show.

06:15.755 --> 06:18.073
I am sick of doing it in my real life.

06:18.107 --> 06:19.881
Are... are you sure?

06:19.927 --> 06:23.430
It's not like we're gonna hold hands or
anything. Let 'em think what they want.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.781
Saturday night, we're on.

06:28.075 --> 06:30.582
- let's not watch "dirty harry".
- No, let's not.

06:32.488 --> 06:35.882
Holly, I apologize for just
showing up here so late.

06:35.917 --> 06:39.251
This has been a very difficult time.

06:39.755 --> 06:41.593
Your daughter...

06:41.638 --> 06:43.182
- becca. -
Rebecca- -

06:43.228 --> 06:47.451
the whole situation has caused
a lot of tension in my family.

06:47.488 --> 06:51.191
I mean, we have fought before,
but never anything like this.

06:51.236 --> 06:54.872
Kevin is not talking to saul.
I'm barely speaking to sarah

06:54.916 --> 06:58.882
well, if it's any consolation to
you, becca's barely speaking to me.

06:58.915 --> 07:01.271
Well, then you agree that
something needs to be done.

07:02.515 --> 07:04.182
What do you suggest?

07:04.228 --> 07:09.220
I want you and rebecca to come over
to my house to dinner on friday.

07:10.805 --> 07:14.860
that is the worst
idea that I have ever heard.

07:15.404 --> 07:20.391
I...I mean, the thought of rebecca 
sitting at your table surrounded by the walkers?

07:20.423 --> 07:22.708
Well, she and justin are
already hanging out together.

07:22.731 --> 07:24.769
Well, then let'em
have dinner together.

07:24.809 --> 07:30.283
I mean, and forgive me, but I don't trust
sarah to be within 2 feet of rebecca,

07:30.315 --> 07:33.200
and - and I don't think 
it's being overly protective

07:33.237 --> 07:36.411
to say that spending a
night with your family

07:36.457 --> 07:40.093
is not in the best interest
for me or my daughter.

07:40.137 --> 07:43.740
I was hoping that you
would ask her. Will you?

07:47.345 --> 07:49.403
Brothers & Sisters
117 All In The Family

07:50.037 --> 07:53.971
This is the worst frost we've had since
'98. We've lost 80% of our citrus crop.

07:55.097 --> 07:57.181
I know the utility deferment
plan protects the farmers.

07:57.228 --> 08:00.403
What about the people who pick the fruit? They're
cold. They're tired. They haven't been paid.

08:01.235 --> 08:02.340
Hi. So, um,

08:02.775 --> 08:04.383
we're being inundated
with calls demanding

08:04.426 --> 08:06.501
to know whether you're changing
your tune on immigration.

08:06.546 --> 08:10.530
Changing my...I am merely pointing out that
we're gonna continue to incure huge costs,

08:10.565 --> 08:12.353
medical and otherwise,
if we don't fix this.

08:12.398 --> 08:14.113
Oh, an economic
initiative. That's a relief.

08:14.156 --> 08:17.293
And here I was so worried that
you were being socially minded.

08:17.328 --> 08:19.212
Just spin it. It's what I hired you for.

08:19.258 --> 08:21.112
No, you hired me
because of my cute bu...

08:23.417 --> 08:26.872
I thought it was a mouse. I'm like-

08:26.917 --> 08:28.881
there's a very small person down there.

08:28.928 --> 08:30.861
Yes, I know. Jack, you've been found.

08:30.898 --> 08:32.082
Kitty, my son jack.

08:32.128 --> 08:34.203
- Jack. Well, hello.
- Nice to meet you.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.291
- Nice to meet you.
- It's spring break.

08:37.486 --> 08:38.679
It's your turn to hide now.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.500
Oh. Okay.

08:40.544 --> 08:42.972
One one thousand, two one
thousand, three one thousand

08:43.018 --> 08:44.932
oh...oh, you mean...you mean you
want me to hide now? You know what?

08:44.968 --> 08:47.683
No, no, no. The...the, um, the
deadline on my press release...

08:47.717 --> 08:48.781
oh, just multitask.

08:48.827 --> 08:51.720
Dad, the soda machine
in the kitchen's jammed.

08:51.755 --> 08:53.940
Hi. Hi.

08:53.986 --> 08:56.750
Um, you must be sofia.

08:56.788 --> 08:58.882
- I'M... kitty.
- Kitty.

08:58.928 --> 09:00.951
- Like a cat?
- sofia.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.451
Come on, you're supposed to be hiding.

09:02.497 --> 09:03.920
- You work for my dad, right?
- Yeah.

09:03.957 --> 09:05.230
Can you fix the soda machine?

09:05.275 --> 09:08.633
Sofe, Kitty's my communications
director and my friend.

09:08.666 --> 09:11.442
Friend, yeah. Um... hmm.

09:11.488 --> 09:14.742
And I, uh, I better,
um, get back to work.

09:14.778 --> 09:15.942
Hide and go work.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.420
- Hide and go work.
- Let's go we finish this in your office.

09:17.455 --> 09:19.241
Sure,

09:19.288 --> 09:22.281
A small child under your
desk, very J. F. K. Of you.

09:22.317 --> 09:25.283
I was gonna warn you, but
I've been a little busy.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.070
No, you know, no,
no. It- - it's fine,

09:27.117 --> 09:30.611
I- - except I did reference my
butt front of your 8 year old.

09:30.655 --> 09:34.242
Oh, jack loves a good butt reference,
and boogers. That's a big one.

09:34.275 --> 09:36.890
So do you want to have dinner
with us tomorrow night?

09:37.586 --> 09:40.262
Did you just go
from "boogers" to "dinner"?

09:40.305 --> 09:42.902
There's a great steak house
in montecito. Kids love it.

09:42.938 --> 09:45.033
They have amazing
sides...snap peas

09:45.077 --> 09:47.252
and who exactly do you want
me to be at this dinner?

09:47.298 --> 09:51.770
Do you want me to be your employee/friend who you
happen to take for steak 80 miles north of L. A.?

09:51.808 --> 09:53.300
Just be yourself.

09:53.347 --> 09:56.773
I mean, they'll be asleep before
the whole room thing is an issue.

09:56.807 --> 09:59.042
Oh, they're gonna figure it
out way before "the room thing".

09:59.076 --> 10:01.112
I mean, kids aren't stupid.

10:01.538 --> 10:02.932
Look, I'm new at this.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.793
I just thought it would be a good idea
for us all to have dinner together,

10:05.828 --> 10:09.050
and I was gonna say something
to sofia beforehand.

10:09.098 --> 10:11.311
You were? I mean, because it's
not because I've...I've...

10:11.346 --> 10:12.671
I don't want you to do that now.

10:12.708 --> 10:13.963
You mean you don't want me to?

10:14.007 --> 10:17.001
Well, no, no, I do, but,
um, just only if you want to.

10:17.498 --> 10:20.910
Wow, you are so much articulating 
when you're talking about politics.

10:20.957 --> 10:22.780
You're gonna love the steak.

10:23.268 --> 10:24.732
I don't want to do it.

10:24.775 --> 10:26.830
There are risks involved with amnio.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.292
Yeah, but the doctor said we
should at least talk about it.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.710
Look, we're having twins.
You're a higher risk pregnancy.

10:31.747 --> 10:33.561
Everything's fine.

10:33.605 --> 10:36.732
I mean, I gained, like, 8
pounds in the last three weeks.

10:36.768 --> 10:39.492
Something's thriving
besides my appetite.

10:39.996 --> 10:41.273
Your cleavage?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.290
Cute.

10:42.336 --> 10:46.692
I'm just saying, we have an opportunity to
get some really valuable genetic information.

10:46.727 --> 10:49.482
Genetic information?

10:50.016 --> 10:51.722
This is about paternity, isn't it?

10:51.765 --> 10:54.333
This whole rebecca thing,
it's just making me think.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.961
That's a completely different situation.
She never had a father growing up.

10:57.995 --> 10:58.580
Our kids have you.

10:58.626 --> 11:02.471
I know, but maybe they should have a
clear sense of where they came from.

11:02.506 --> 11:05.280
Look, my brothers did
this amazing thing for us.

11:05.326 --> 11:08.191
I just... I want to talk to them,
see if they want to weigh in.

11:08.237 --> 11:11.132
They aren't gonna be weighing in
when it comes to potty training.

11:11.177 --> 11:15.382
I just really hope it starts to hit
you soon that we're the parents here,

11:15.416 --> 11:17.671
just you and me.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.512
- Hello?
- is this Kevin Walker?

11:24.546 --> 11:25.580
Yes, it is.

11:25.625 --> 11:28.933
Mr. Walker, please hold for
donald dudley, chad barry's manager.

11:29.966 --> 11:31.233
Sure.

11:46.937 --> 11:48.863
Donald ? I'm Kevin Walker

11:48.905 --> 11:51.843
- Kevin. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

11:54.407 --> 11:56.072
So why do I feel like
my life is in danger?

11:56.118 --> 11:57.563
- Relax. You want something to eat?
- No. Good,

11:57.598 --> 11:59.353
this place serves dog food.

11:59.397 --> 12:03.303
Listen, I'm sorry to bring you here, but I
need to be a little clandestine about this.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.380
If he found out I was talking
to you, he'd probably fire me.

12:05.418 --> 12:07.413
With all due respect, maybe he should.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.683
you're very direct. You're a lawyer. 
I used to be a lawyer. It's a god awful job.

12:11.717 --> 12:13.790
Donald, listen, I don't know
what you want to talk about.

12:13.837 --> 12:15.881
To be honest, I'm not sure
why I agreed to come here.

12:16.455 --> 12:18.003
Even the coffee here stinks.

12:18.048 --> 12:19.840
Okay, Kevin,
here's the thing- -

12:19.888 --> 12:23.313
when I met chad barry, he
was working construction.

12:23.347 --> 12:25.461
He was taking the bus 30 miles a day.

12:25.506 --> 12:28.103
My wife took pity on him.
She found him a used car.

12:28.136 --> 12:30.661
- I care what happens to him.
- Oh, and I don't?

12:30.707 --> 12:33.270
I just want to make sure
your intentions are honorable.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.852
I'm not marrying him,
donald. I'm going to a movie.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.800
You see, that's when you are wrong.

12:37.846 --> 12:41.290
What he's about to do for you,
there's no turning back from that.

12:41.338 --> 12:45.081
Okay, he's not doing anything for
me, right? He's doing it for himself.

12:45.128 --> 12:48.842
Please. Semantics. We wouldn't be
sitting here if it wasn't for you.

12:48.877 --> 12:51.092
You're the first guy
that's ever gotten this far.

12:51.127 --> 12:53.482
Did you bring me here to tell me that?

12:53.516 --> 12:55.832
Listen, people find out about chad,

12:55.875 --> 12:58.120
I got a big office, I'm gonna be fine.

12:58.166 --> 13:01.232
And believe me,I won't miss waking up
every morning wondering how many rumors

13:01.265 --> 13:02.593
I'm gonna have to bury that day.

13:02.635 --> 13:05.823
And I'm telling you, he comes
out of the closet for you,

13:05.856 --> 13:09.013
it's like being with a virgin.
He's yours for life, kid.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.950
He's not coming out
of the closet for me.

13:12.987 --> 13:14.553
Keep telling yourself that.

13:14.598 --> 13:17.213
But if you walk down
that red carpet with him,

13:17.245 --> 13:19.830
you might as well be
walking down the aisle.

13:22.537 --> 13:25.190
I,uh- - I gotta take this one.

13:26.076 --> 13:29.762
Why'd they close that deal without telling
me? No, that's not the way I do business.

13:31.358 --> 13:35.323
Uh, do you have a second ?
- I wanted to run something by you.

13:35.718 --> 13:36.532
Yup.

13:36.575 --> 13:39.790
It's about tomorrow night you
probably already have plans.

13:39.825 --> 13:42.321
- Probably.
- Then forget it. It's not important.

13:43.677 --> 13:45.860
I'm meeting maureen
and caris at spaceland.

13:45.906 --> 13:48.890
Do you want to stop being so cryptic
and just tell me what's going on?

13:52.748 --> 13:55.680
Nora Walker she came by.

13:56.067 --> 13:59.962
She did? That's kinda sketchy of her.
What, are you guys, like, friends?

13:59.995 --> 14:03.641
No, we're...we're not
friends. It's just that...

14:04.605 --> 14:09.191
she invited us to dinner
at her house with the family.

14:09.225 --> 14:10.093
You're kidding.

14:10.137 --> 14:13.443
No, I know. It's ridiculous.
I'll just tell her to forget it.

14:13.476 --> 14:16.751
No, they're curious to meet me.
What's so ridiculous about it?

14:20.475 --> 14:21.783
You don't want to go ? Do you ?

14:21.827 --> 14:25.000
I - I just think that it would be uncomfortable.

14:25.045 --> 14:27.872
Well, you work with tommy
walker. Is that uncomfortable?

14:27.908 --> 14:30.943
Well, that's different,
becca. It's business.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.870
So you don't have to go, but I'm
kind of psyched to see the house.

14:33.905 --> 14:36.990
Justin says it's totally palatial.

14:37.948 --> 14:39.401
Mom, you look shocked.

14:39.445 --> 14:42.570
No, it's just not the
reaction that I expected.

14:42.616 --> 14:46.622
Why not? They're the ones who made us millionaires.
How often do I get to meet my benefactors?

14:46.655 --> 14:50.432
If ty want me to go over there they
can all pet me, it's the least I can do.

14:52.328 --> 14:54.693
Okay then, we'll go.

14:55.805 --> 14:59.453
You know what? I think I'd
actually prefer to go alone.

15:00.356 --> 15:01.221
Becca.

15:01.266 --> 15:03.961
What, you want to come along
so you can protect me,

15:04.005 --> 15:06.670
like you've protected
me for the past 20 years?

15:06.707 --> 15:08.883
I think I got it from here.

15:14.617 --> 15:16.520
Somebody slept in.

15:16.565 --> 15:18.783
It's 8:00 in the morning.

15:19.897 --> 15:21.523
Mom, what are you doing?

15:21.565 --> 15:24.051
I'm marinating... the meat, not me.

15:24.088 --> 15:26.541
Please tell me you're free tonight.

15:26.575 --> 15:27.882
I'm not.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.150
Oh, really?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.672
Oh, mom, please don't sound
shocked that I actually have plans.

15:31.708 --> 15:35.283
I'm- - I'm having dinner
with robert and his kids.

15:35.315 --> 15:37.321
Ooh. That's a very big step.

15:37.356 --> 15:39.143
No. No,

15:39.187 --> 15:41.213
They- - they just happen to be
in town. It's... it's nothing.

15:41.247 --> 15:42.710
Oh, well, good. Can you
do it another night?

15:42.758 --> 15:44.593
I thought you just said
that it was a very big step.

15:44.637 --> 15:48.193
It is a big step, but I think we
have another big step to deal with.

15:48.227 --> 15:49.160
I'm having a dinner tonight,

15:49.207 --> 15:50.990
and I would really like it
if you would all be there.

15:51.038 --> 15:54.591
Mom, you know, I have been so good
about my family dinner attendance.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.940
I just think that I'm
entitled to a personal day.

15:56.978 --> 15:59.163
This is different.

15:59.207 --> 16:02.350
I invited rebecca to dinner.

16:02.915 --> 16:04.213
- No, you did not.
- Yes.

16:04.245 --> 16:05.472
Mom- - mom,
are you insane?

16:05.516 --> 16:09.592
I think it would be nice if we
just all got to know each other.

16:09.628 --> 16:10.520
Why?

16:10.568 --> 16:13.712
Because...be...
because she exists.

16:13.756 --> 16:17.420
Because the unknown is always so
much more disturbing than the reality.

16:17.457 --> 16:20.331
I think we have to
confront this, normalize it.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.483
- Normalize it?
- Yes.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.473
Oh, like the time that you
invited dad's mistress over,

16:23.515 --> 16:26.721
and then you outed her in front of everybody?
No, no, no. That, that kind of normal?

16:26.757 --> 16:29.261
Kitty, you know what? That's
not fair. That's just not fair.

16:29.305 --> 16:32.150
Your father had just died. I was in shock.
All right, I was mean and vindictive.

16:32.186 --> 16:34.990
But this time I'm trying very
hard to do the right thing.

16:35.038 --> 16:38.883
Listen to me. J- just because she has
some shared D. N. A. with your kids- -

16:38.916 --> 16:41.600
you don't know anything about
her. You don't know what she's like.

16:41.638 --> 16:43.901
Seriously, mom, don't.

16:43.948 --> 16:47.802
You- - you are just trying to
control an uncontrollable situation.

16:48.378 --> 16:51.480
I'm not trying
to control anything.

16:51.525 --> 16:54.393
You are hosting a "meet the
illegitimate daughter" dinner.

16:54.426 --> 16:57.100
I'm sorry, but even if I
were free, I wouldn't come.

16:57.138 --> 16:59.260
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

16:59.305 --> 17:00.730
I thought you would
have problems with it.

17:00.766 --> 17:02.421
What is that supposed to mean?

17:02.456 --> 17:04.042
Your relationship with your dad.

17:04.087 --> 17:07.122
Okay, so, freud, do you think
you're really ready for this?

17:07.165 --> 17:09.012
I mean, do you think you're really
gonna be able to handle this?

17:09.055 --> 17:13.650
Because once she walks through the
front door, you can't take it back.

17:13.688 --> 17:15.401
She's a Walker.

17:15.446 --> 17:18.109
Kitty, she already is.

17:18.636 --> 17:21.953
We need food network distribution,
utilities assistance...

17:23.188 --> 17:25.092
All right, I'll call him right now.

17:25.137 --> 17:28.042
I am so sorry, sofe. One more
call, and we are out of here.

17:28.077 --> 17:31.500
It's okay. I feel bad
for those workers.

17:32.557 --> 17:34.941
Me, too.

17:35.446 --> 17:37.413
I'm sorry you and your brother
are stuck in here all day.

17:37.445 --> 17:39.811
It's fine. I'm very self- sufficient.

17:39.856 --> 17:42.003
That's what means. Allen
put on my report card.

17:42.035 --> 17:44.301
Oh, and, uh, "industrious".

17:44.346 --> 17:47.173
Apparently, I'm very industrious.

17:48.357 --> 17:50.663
Sofe, I need to talk to you.

17:50.698 --> 17:52.012
Am I in trouble?

17:52.047 --> 17:53.332
No! No sweetie.

17:53.916 --> 17:57.030
God, we've made you neurotic.

17:58.966 --> 18:01.270
So, um...

18:01.318 --> 18:04.890
I've invited someone, uh, to
T. M. G. 's with us tonight.

18:04.935 --> 18:08.483
- But that's our dinner. Oh,
- I know, and it still is.

18:08.518 --> 18:10.661
But do you remember kitty?

18:10.705 --> 18:13.953
As in "meow"? Yeah, I know about her.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.250
You do?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.470
There was a picture of
you and her a magazine.

18:17.518 --> 18:21.353
You were at restaurant, and she was wearing
this red dress that mom thought looked cheap.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.851
Is she your girlfriend?

18:29.838 --> 18:32.171
well, I guess you could call her that.

18:32.207 --> 18:35.702
I... i would call her that.

18:36.427 --> 18:38.901
Are you okay calling her that?

18:38.945 --> 18:40.902
Not that you have to
actually call her

18:40.947 --> 18:44.120
I- I wish your mother hadn't have shown you that photo.

18:44.478 --> 18:46.633
Really? A paternity test?

18:46.675 --> 18:48.383
Look, I don't know, dude. I mean,

18:48.426 --> 18:50.761
we went into this thing thinking
that we weren't gonna know that, right?

18:50.795 --> 18:53.260
I know, and the last thing I
need right now is a kid, tommy...

18:53.297 --> 18:55.511
two kids. I can't even
handle a relationship.

18:55.558 --> 18:58.920
Relax. I'm not asking anyone to
be more involved in their lives.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.660
But if it comes out
they're courtesy of me,

19:00.706 --> 19:02.660
I know I'm gonna feel this
extra pressure you know,

19:02.707 --> 19:05.293
to deliver on birthdays,
holidays, go to all the games.

19:05.336 --> 19:08.022
Tommy's got the games covered. Why
don't you stick to, like, bake sales?

19:08.068 --> 19:10.723
Can we have a serious discussion
about this before rebecca gets here

19:10.755 --> 19:12.150
and the whole nightmare begins?

19:12.195 --> 19:14.882
Yeah, that's whose D. N.
A. We should be testing.

19:14.918 --> 19:15.803
What?

19:15.846 --> 19:18.380
Well, what, we're going on
holly's word? How reliable is that?

19:18.757 --> 19:20.702
Holly wouldn't make this up.

19:20.747 --> 19:22.290
She didn't even want
rebecca to find out.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.171
Yeah, that's what she told us.
She may have lied for the money.

19:25.217 --> 19:28.930
Come on,don't you want to know beyond a reasonable doubt
before we bring her in here like she's one of the family?

19:28.966 --> 19:30.703
Did you bring your
D. N. A. kit with you?

19:30.738 --> 19:32.132
You're gonna swab her over salad?

19:32.166 --> 19:33.261
I could get a stray hair.

19:33.307 --> 19:36.511
No, that's not gonna work. You
have to get it from the root.

19:36.546 --> 19:39.191
- What are you, columbo?
- I watch all the crime shows.

19:39.227 --> 19:40.963
I'll take her water glass into a lab.

19:41.006 --> 19:43.361
No, no. That's not gonna work
either. The glass will get corrupted.

19:43.398 --> 19:46.483
Look, are you both
high? You want your D.N.A test right here.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.852
She's hot. I feel nothing.

19:49.537 --> 19:51.200
Oh, god.

19:58.436 --> 19:59.791
- hey.
- hey.

19:59.838 --> 20:01.121
Hi, I'm Kevin.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.491
- Come on in.
- Hi. Cool.

20:03.727 --> 20:05.380
It's a nice house.

20:05.418 --> 20:07.043
Thanks.

20:07.658 --> 20:09.651
Mom?

20:10.088 --> 20:12.793
This is Rebecca, mom.

20:16.618 --> 20:19.891
Yes... of course. Hello. Welcome.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.091
Thank you. It's nice to meet you.

20:23.127 --> 20:26.263
Nice to meet you, too, Rebecca.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.552
I can't believe you spent
all that time in chicago.

20:52.587 --> 20:53.960
I mean, it's freezing there, isn't it?

20:54.008 --> 20:57.093
Mm, yeah, it's really cold,
but the summers are gorgeous.

20:57.136 --> 21:00.191
Oh. And where were you, the,
uh, university of chicago?

21:00.226 --> 21:02.613
Northwestern. I was a drama major.

21:02.647 --> 21:04.962
Oh, an actress like your mother?

21:05.007 --> 21:08.431
Uh, barely. I- - that's one of
the reasons why I dropped out.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.453
I just don't see a
future in that stuff.

21:10.496 --> 21:12.413
What were the other reasons you left?

21:12.456 --> 21:14.312
- It's not a job interview, sarah.
- I'm just I'm interested.

21:14.346 --> 21:16.221
It's cool. Um...

21:17.377 --> 21:19.531
I had a pretty devastating breakup.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.260
I sort of spiraled, and then I- - I
just started painting all the time.

21:22.295 --> 21:24.182
Oh, you paint? Are you any good?

21:24.227 --> 21:26.262
'Cause we're all pretty bad
when it comes to the arts.

21:26.297 --> 21:27.521
That's not true. Sarah used to draw.

21:27.555 --> 21:29.161
Yeah, when I was 10. I-

21:29.196 --> 21:30.730
I write a little bit.

21:30.778 --> 21:32.120
- I read about you.
- Me?

21:32.527 --> 21:35.112
Someone sent me a link
to "the skinny minnie".

21:35.947 --> 21:37.651
are you really dating chad barry?

21:37.697 --> 21:41.892
Uh... no. Yes. Yeah,
I- - uh, I- I know him.

21:41.928 --> 21:43.721
Yeah, like romeo knows juliet.

21:43.768 --> 21:45.531
Or like siegfried knows roy.

21:47.446 --> 21:49.992
This whole family loves to kid.

21:51.045 --> 21:54.210
so, uh, where's
the other sister? Kitty?

22:00.197 --> 22:01.431
She didn't want to meet me.

22:01.477 --> 22:04.712
Oh, no, no, no, not at all.
She- - she- - she had a date.

22:04.745 --> 22:06.610
It's with senator mccallister.

22:06.656 --> 22:08.491
Oh, yeah, I read about that, too.

22:09.627 --> 22:13.130
Apparently all my children
have made the goss columns.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.961
I'm not so sure I
should be proud about that.

22:15.995 --> 22:17.831
How about seconds? Anyone?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.643
I do. I'm eating for three.

22:19.685 --> 22:21.452
- Do you have any more iced tea?
- Yeah, I'll get it.

22:21.488 --> 22:23.822
I'll get it. Um...

22:23.868 --> 22:26.592
I'll get the drinks.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.331
Okay, I'll help.

22:32.076 --> 22:34.162
They are both very polite.

22:36.925 --> 22:39.092
- Give me the glass. - You
need a time- out, kevin.

22:39.138 --> 22:41.272
Humor me. I'm a lawyer.
I like to know the facts.

22:44.657 --> 22:46.333
Fine, walking away.

22:46.407 --> 22:49.282
So justin tells me
you- - you went to marshall.

22:49.328 --> 22:53.580
Uh, yeah, except for one year um,
when my mom moved us up to ojai.

22:55.148 --> 22:56.843
- You're kidding.
- No. Why? Thanks.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.783
We have a ranch in ojai.

22:58.826 --> 23:00.023
It's so boring there, isn't it?

23:00.066 --> 23:02.763
I'm sure your mother
didn't find it boring.

23:04.276 --> 23:08.280
It's our company name. It was
our father's favorite place

23:08.318 --> 23:10.340
Right,yeah,
I'm- -

23:10.387 --> 23:12.472
I guess that explains that. I'm sorry.

23:12.518 --> 23:14.572
I didn't mean to-
- no, no, it's fine.

23:14.607 --> 23:16.092
Sarah is just being rude.

23:16.138 --> 23:20.131
My apologies, but this meal has
reached a new level of weirdness.

23:20.175 --> 23:24.140
Sarah, we all know what happened.
That's why we're here tonight.

23:24.368 --> 23:27.051
I would like us all to
get to know each other.

23:34.528 --> 23:36.140
Here's the
check from the table.

23:38.296 --> 23:39.772
The snap peas are really good.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.260
They were better last time.

23:43.695 --> 23:47.752
So, sofe, when kitty was your
age, she was a spelling bee champion, too.

23:50.115 --> 23:54.092
No, your- - your dad's bragging about
me. I was really just the runner up.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.103
So what was your hardest word?

23:59.137 --> 24:00.523
I don't remember.

24:00.558 --> 24:01.871
Come on, sofe.

24:01.915 --> 24:04.783
oh, I know one! 
"M-I- s- s- I- s- s- I- p- I".

24:05.285 --> 24:07.203
Hmm, very good. That
is very impressive, jack.

24:07.246 --> 24:10.521
Thank you. No, it's not.
Everyone knows how to spell that.

24:11.138 --> 24:13.670
I don't think many 8 year
olds know how to spell it.

24:13.707 --> 24:16.073
- Jack, good job.
- Thanks, daddy.

24:20.387 --> 24:24.281
So, uh, sofia, do you
like the, uh, cheetahs?

24:24.315 --> 24:24.912
The who?

24:24.957 --> 24:26.862
I think it's the cheetah girls.

24:26.896 --> 24:29.600
Oh, that's right. Oops.

24:29.646 --> 24:31.512
Yeah, it's the cheetah girls. I
- I knew that.

24:31.547 --> 24:33.283
What, did you, like,
google 10 year olds?

24:33.318 --> 24:35.660
Sofie, that's a warning.

24:36.106 --> 24:37.762
So how's everyone doing over here?

24:37.807 --> 24:40.530
Good. I think we, uh,
could use some dessert.

24:40.565 --> 24:42.443
- I want the turtle sundae.
- Okay.

24:42.486 --> 24:44.453
And, - sofia, do
you- I'm not hungry.

24:44.496 --> 24:46.392
Oh, well, you know what they say.

24:46.437 --> 24:49.442
Even if you're full, dessert
is a separate compartment.

24:49.476 --> 24:50.433
No one says that.

24:50.475 --> 24:51.742
Does your daughter. Like ice cream?

24:51.775 --> 24:53.012
I'm not her daughter!

24:53.057 --> 24:54.863
Sofia mccallister.
I'll get some napkins.

24:54.907 --> 24:56.682
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

24:56.998 --> 24:58.801
You sit down right now
and apologize to kitty.

24:58.836 --> 25:00.730
For what? She's not my mother!

25:00.777 --> 25:03.690
And just because you're in a picture with
my dad does not mean you're anything to me.

25:03.728 --> 25:05.670
- Sofia!
- No, it's okay. She's right.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.793
No. No, it is not.

25:09.735 --> 25:11.783
So you said for "three".
Are you having twins?

25:11.817 --> 25:13.782
- Yes, we are.
- Boys or girls?

25:14.428 --> 25:16.103
- one of each.
- Yeah.

25:17.525 --> 25:21.813
So... uh, how long are you planning
to stay at your mother's house?

25:21.846 --> 25:24.103
Oh, I don't know. I'm
just sort of, um...

25:24.496 --> 25:26.661
like I said, I'm on the rebound
from this guy in chicago.

25:26.705 --> 25:30.391
So I just wanna take it easy. You
know, chill out for a little bit?

25:30.807 --> 25:32.722
You know, see where it all goes. Ow!

25:34.216 --> 25:36.503
- Did you just pull my hair?
- Did I?

25:36.545 --> 25:38.873
- You just pulled a hair out of my head.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

25:38.907 --> 25:40.911
Oh, my god, why would you do that?

25:43.025 --> 25:45.180
I'm sorry. You know
what? I saw a split end.

25:45.216 --> 25:47.750
It's just something
I do with my sisters.

25:47.788 --> 25:50.250
That's not why you did it. Tell her why.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.862
Actually, you got me started
with all your talk of D. N. A.

25:52.898 --> 25:53.722
- D. N. A.?
- Yeah.

25:53.766 --> 25:56.522
Tommy, enough about whose D.
N. A. It is. You're the father.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.250
She just found out who her
father was at 20 years old,

25:59.288 --> 26:00.790
and look how well that turned out.

26:00.838 --> 26:02.820
I just- - I don't want that to
happen to our kids, all right?

26:02.856 --> 26:04.572
I think she turned out fine, tommy.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.910
I'm sure she's great.

26:05.955 --> 26:08.492
I'm just saying there's been
a lot of fallout, all right?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.230
I mean, Kevin doesn't even believe her.

26:10.276 --> 26:13.520
- You pulled a hair out of my head
to get my D. N. A.? - Look- - no,

26:13.555 --> 26:14.523
let me explain

26:14.566 --> 26:17.300
- I'm gonna kill you! 
- Okay, I gotta go. I- I gotta go.

26:17.336 --> 26:18.832
Rebecca, please wait.

26:18.875 --> 26:22.901
You guys are whack. I mean, seriously,
you just pulled a hair out of my head?

26:22.948 --> 26:26.941
Oh, my god, you are the most insane
group of people that I have ever met!

26:26.975 --> 26:29.693
And don't bother with
the test. He's not my dad.

26:29.736 --> 26:32.760
He might've been your dad, but he
was nothing to me. He's still nothing.

26:32.795 --> 26:33.613
Rebecca...

26:33.656 --> 26:35.800
I appreciate this dinner,

26:35.845 --> 26:39.601
but I'm not a part of this
family. I never will be.

26:39.637 --> 26:41.570
Rebecca, please...

26:41.616 --> 26:45.211
You can be a part of this family
regardless how you got here.

26:45.247 --> 26:48.553
He may not have been your
father in any way you knew,

26:48.586 --> 26:51.863
and clearly he wasn't
any kind of husband either.

26:52.576 --> 26:54.452
It wasn't your fault, Rebecca.

26:54.495 --> 26:57.073
And it wasn't your mom's. It's his.

27:02.527 --> 27:04.762
Well, they're down.

27:06.515 --> 27:09.413
That meal was a success.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.761
What, are you trying
to make a quick getaway?

27:16.827 --> 27:18.620
- Uh, look, robert...
- don't go. I'm sorry.

27:18.667 --> 27:21.393
I shouldn't have snapped,
but sofia knows better.

27:21.426 --> 27:22.991
She's never behaved like that.

27:23.028 --> 27:24.521
Maybe she didn't have a choice.

27:24.566 --> 27:28.792
I mean, you can't tell somebody how to
feel or... how to react, especially a kid.

27:28.828 --> 27:30.262
She's very mature for her age.

27:30.297 --> 27:31.940
She's 10.

27:31.986 --> 27:35.301
And I couldn't stomach having dinner
with- - with that rebecca person,

27:35.335 --> 27:37.283
and I'm a grown up.

27:37.536 --> 27:40.883
Lucky for me, my parent
couldn't make me go.

27:41.256 --> 27:42.700
You think this is my fault?

27:42.745 --> 27:45.113
- 'cause I did everything I was supposed to do here.
- I know.

27:45.155 --> 27:48.901
I talked to both kids. They had
plenty of time to process and prepare.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.771
I took 'em to their favorite place.

27:50.817 --> 27:53.031
Come on, let's just
look on the bright side.

27:53.067 --> 27:54.681
At least we've broken in the "g" word.

27:54.726 --> 27:57.862
This is not a treaty
that you're negotiating.

27:57.896 --> 27:59.783
We're talking about your kids.

27:59.828 --> 28:03.203
And I just think that it
might've been too much too soon.

28:03.247 --> 28:06.123
I mean, going out for dinner the
first week that they come here

28:06.157 --> 28:09.003
and shoving me with my stupid
hobbies down their throats?

28:09.035 --> 28:11.283
No. I didn't shove you down their throat.

28:11.326 --> 28:13.981
And by the way, if you didn't
wanna come, you didn't have to.

28:14.897 --> 28:16.822
I didn't say that.

28:16.867 --> 28:20.673
I'm just saying that I think
maybe they're not ready yet.

28:20.705 --> 28:23.100
Them're you?

28:23.147 --> 28:25.890
Would you please put those keys down?

28:25.938 --> 28:30.021
Look, I... I know this isn't easy.
It's complicated. I'm complicated.

28:30.065 --> 28:33.253
But I want my kids to have the same rules they've
always had. I wanna make things normal for them.

28:33.288 --> 28:35.283
Oh, god, you and my mother. You
know what? You can't do that.

28:35.318 --> 28:37.351
You can't make things normal.

28:37.398 --> 28:39.552
They take time. And
look at you, look at you!

28:39.586 --> 28:42.100
You go at warp speed.

28:42.147 --> 28:45.093
I don't know, I mean, it's like you're
trying to rush through everything.

28:45.126 --> 28:46.300
What am I trying to rush through?

28:46.345 --> 28:49.391
Everything- - me, us. I mean, I don't
know, maybe that's the way you are.

28:49.438 --> 28:53.021
I mean, look at your career. You go careening from
one achievement to the next and that's great,

28:53.056 --> 28:54.830
but you just came on so strong.

28:54.878 --> 28:57.331
And nobody likes me
that much that fast.

28:57.366 --> 28:59.751
And I just can't help
wondering if... if

28:59.795 --> 29:04.183
maybe you're just looking for a farely
to stand up with you at the podium.

29:06.365 --> 29:07.552
Is that what you think?

29:07.596 --> 29:09.263
I don't know. I don't...you know what?

29:09.298 --> 29:10.893
Maybe I'm just freaking out. It's late.

29:10.938 --> 29:13.963
No, no, I think you're
right. I think you should go.

29:18.748 --> 29:21.253
Oh, my god,

29:21.297 --> 29:23.123
It's okay, sarah, I've got it.

29:23.545 --> 29:26.133
Oh, come on, mom, let me help.

29:26.176 --> 29:29.132
Noreally, I think you
should just go on home.

29:31.056 --> 29:33.640
I gotta hand it to you,
mom. That was quite a party.

29:33.676 --> 29:35.420
How is it that you're able to do that?

29:35.468 --> 29:40.882
I mean, even with dad and his whole
republican personal responsibility spiel,

29:40.918 --> 29:45.670
you always managed to show us
how important it was to give.

29:45.705 --> 29:48.022
The world's not fair.
You do what you can !

29:48.637 --> 29:50.831
That's exactly what I mean.

29:51.307 --> 29:54.981
I am often astounded at your compassion.

29:56.315 --> 30:00.060
I just, I don't understand
why it doesn't extend to me.

30:00.556 --> 30:01.741
That's not true.

30:01.777 --> 30:03.332
Isn't it?

30:03.375 --> 30:05.173
I mean, tonight, I'm
still in the doghouse,

30:05.217 --> 30:09.563
and yet, unbelievably, you managed to
include someone who, by all rights,

30:09.606 --> 30:13.761
you could've gone your whole life without
talking to. Don't you think that's a little unfair?

30:14.328 --> 30:16.513
Mom, I didn't come here
tonight because of rebecca.

30:16.558 --> 30:19.811
I came here because I want
things to be better with us.

30:19.856 --> 30:24.621
I need you to care about me the same
way that you care about the world.

30:26.057 --> 30:28.472
Well, of course I love you.

30:28.515 --> 30:30.902
Then stop punishing me.

30:35.846 --> 30:37.821
I'm sorry.

30:37.867 --> 30:40.102
I'm so...I'm sorry.

30:40.136 --> 30:42.570
I'm just so mad.

30:42.617 --> 30:46.583
Your father's dead, and I need
someone to be furious with.

30:46.628 --> 30:51.750
It's so hard to tell somebody who
isn't around anymore to go to hell.

30:52.898 --> 30:55.102
Oh, mom.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.291
What?

31:11.336 --> 31:12.381
I didn't say anything.

31:12.426 --> 31:15.020
Well, if you're gonna look
at me like that, just ask.

31:15.056 --> 31:17.450
I didn't look at anything.

31:17.498 --> 31:21.013
It was fine, okay? Just fine...

31:21.828 --> 31:23.980
and awful.

31:24.025 --> 31:26.852
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not, mom. You're relieved.

31:27.266 --> 31:29.841
You're angry, I know.

31:30.667 --> 31:33.061
So I'm just gonna be here.

31:33.106 --> 31:37.250
And if and when you feel like
talking or venting or whatever.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.112
there's really not much to talk about.

31:40.155 --> 31:44.780
I started with the beet salad,
and then kevin pulled my hair.

31:46.058 --> 31:47.230
He what?

31:47.278 --> 31:49.433
You heard me.

31:49.976 --> 31:54.720
Well, like in a playful,
brotherly kind of way?

31:54.755 --> 31:56.991
No, more like a, uh...

31:57.035 --> 31:59.222
forensic scientist kind of way.

31:59.258 --> 32:01.370
- What?
- Yeah, don't ask.

32:01.416 --> 32:04.690
They just- - they have their
own sibling thing going on.

32:04.735 --> 32:09.022
You know, it's like they're yelling
and fighting and talking over each other.

32:09.057 --> 32:12.373
It's completely dysfunctional, like
they're this- - this big crazy clique.

32:12.408 --> 32:16.430
And I am... so clearly not a part of it.

32:22.515 --> 32:24.393
But this is how you set it up.

32:24.436 --> 32:26.622
- Don't say that.
- Oh, but it is.

32:27.157 --> 32:29.562
I mean, you didn't just
deprive me of a father, mom.

32:29.596 --> 32:31.770
You deprived me of an entire family.

32:31.805 --> 32:34.463
Honey, you have a family.

32:34.506 --> 32:36.920
You and me, we're family.

32:36.965 --> 32:39.311
I could've had so much more.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.422
I could've had brothers and
sisters all of these years.

32:41.465 --> 32:45.281
I could've had this...this busy,
chaotic childhood that you

32:45.316 --> 32:48.673
that you fantasize about as a kid,

32:49.117 --> 32:50.220
but you didn't let me.

32:50.258 --> 32:52.723
I'm sorry.

32:52.755 --> 32:55.150
I did my best.

32:55.195 --> 32:58.790
I worked with what I had.
You don't know how it was.

32:58.828 --> 33:01.751
No, I
- I know how it was.

33:01.798 --> 33:05.102
It was exactly the way
that you wanted it to be.

33:11.958 --> 33:14.563
I get it now, you wanting to find out.

33:14.605 --> 33:17.952
I didn't really understand the
impact of rebecca until tonight.

33:17.986 --> 33:20.641
Tommy, if you need to find out, we can.

33:20.688 --> 33:23.312
It's fine. I'm dropping it for good.

33:23.988 --> 33:28.652
But me wanting to find out,
it wasn't just about rebecca.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.370
I mean... you're carrying the babies.

33:32.417 --> 33:36.770
My brothers supplied the seeds. I'm
just like this useless bystander.

33:37.096 --> 33:40.320
I just, I thought if I could
find out more about them,

33:40.355 --> 33:45.013
I'd- - I'd feel more
connected, less...

33:45.045 --> 33:46.892
out of control.

33:46.937 --> 33:50.372
Tommy, we're having
twins. There is no control.

33:51.358 --> 33:54.421
worse, we're having a family.

33:54.467 --> 33:57.392
I mean, you saw dinner tonight.

33:57.428 --> 34:00.322
what have we done?

34:01.516 --> 34:02.581
You pulled her hair out?

34:02.626 --> 34:05.381
No, no, I pulled one
hair. I pulled one strand.

34:05.415 --> 34:08.050
I know. I should be put away.

34:08.085 --> 34:10.003
I scared myself tonight.

34:10.047 --> 34:13.891
And I thought you asked me to be over
here to talk about tomorrow night.

34:14.318 --> 34:17.731
Which, strangely enough, I
am totally not nervous about.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.821
Look, not even shaking.

34:19.867 --> 34:22.652
Actually, I
- I do wanna talk about it.

34:23.196 --> 34:26.880
I've been thinking and,
um... maybe you're right.

34:26.926 --> 34:30.842
You know, maybe... maybe tomorrow
night's not such a good idea.

34:30.877 --> 34:32.882
You're kidding, right?

34:32.928 --> 34:34.860
No. Chad,
I just- -

34:34.908 --> 34:38.540
I just feel what you're about
to do is this major change.

34:38.577 --> 34:42.139
And, you know, it affects us
in- - in ways- - it's not fair,

34:42.186 --> 34:46.072
but, you know, it's forcing us to
go faster than we normally would.

34:46.706 --> 34:47.841
I don't understand.

34:47.887 --> 34:50.860
Okay, look,I just came from a
dinner that never would've happened

34:50.895 --> 34:53.409
if my father just thought
about things first. And...

34:53.886 --> 34:56.541
I don't want you to make a
flippant decision about this.

34:56.577 --> 34:59.611
Flippant? I'm 34 years old.

34:59.658 --> 35:03.351
Okay, so why now? Why all of a sudden
can you make this decision now?

35:03.387 --> 35:05.462
Because we met at the
right time. Who knows?

35:05.498 --> 35:07.502
No, I don't- - please
don't do this for me.

35:07.546 --> 35:10.452
I'm not ready to settle
down, chad, not remotely.

35:10.498 --> 35:13.370
Settledown? Who said anything
about settling down?

35:13.405 --> 35:15.531
If we do this-
- if we do this,

35:15.578 --> 35:18.123
I know I'll feel this pressure
to be this perfect boyfriend.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.672
Otherwise you'll feel like
you've done it for nothing.

35:20.707 --> 35:22.023
I can't even believe this.

35:22.065 --> 35:23.941
I know- - I know I
give off mixed signals.

35:23.988 --> 35:26.501
Mixed signals? It's like
multiple personalities.

35:26.547 --> 35:29.452
I just don't wanna do something
that's gonna make things harder for us.

35:29.487 --> 35:33.080
Believe me, this is making
things harder for us.

35:35.565 --> 35:38.051
You know what? Fine, forget it.
Forget it. We'll go tomorrow.

35:38.086 --> 35:39.290
It's fine. It's absolutely fine.

35:39.337 --> 35:40.470
Well, don't do me any favors.

35:40.516 --> 35:43.320
Look, I'm just- - I...
I got scared, that's all.

35:43.356 --> 35:45.962
It's not about you. It's me.

35:46.756 --> 35:49.780
That's the first honest
thing you've said all night.

35:55.316 --> 35:57.422
hey, come on in. I'm almost done.

35:57.465 --> 36:00.783
Uh, these are the quarterly tax things. They
just need your signature and then we're done.

36:00.815 --> 36:03.623
Okay. How's your mother?

36:03.657 --> 36:05.661
I don't know.

36:05.708 --> 36:08.122
She- - she works in
mysterious ways, saul.

36:08.158 --> 36:09.482
She does.

36:09.525 --> 36:12.292
I hear it was a memorable night.

36:13.217 --> 36:14.981
Yes, it was.

36:15.027 --> 36:18.212
You know what? You should call her. I'm
sure she could use a big brother right now.

36:18.245 --> 36:20.812
Yeah, I call her every day, kevin.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.360
I'm talking about you.

36:23.406 --> 36:24.513
Did you really pull her hair?

36:24.545 --> 36:26.131
Yes, I did, okay? Yeah.

36:26.177 --> 36:28.841
I readily admit it
was not my finest hour.

36:28.878 --> 36:31.512
Actually, it's not been my finest week.

36:31.546 --> 36:33.321
What about us? How are we doing?

36:33.358 --> 36:34.263
What do you mean?

36:34.308 --> 36:37.523
Well, as I recall, the last time
we spoke you were furious with me.

36:38.245 --> 36:40.972
About? Oh, that?

36:41.016 --> 36:45.253
That's water under the bridge. We have a 24-
hour- a- day news cycle around here, saul.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.843
I thought you read the crawl.

36:46.878 --> 36:48.983
By the way...

36:49.025 --> 36:51.351
you did the right thing.

36:51.396 --> 36:53.933
- Rebecca was never gonna stay hidden.
- No.

36:53.975 --> 36:57.212
We were nuts. We were just trying
to keep it a secret like him.

36:57.247 --> 36:58.981
You know, sins of the father?

36:59.028 --> 37:03.263
And the mother. Holly? She
won't speak to me anymore.

37:03.298 --> 37:06.090
Look at us- -
I'm in my 60's,

37:06.137 --> 37:09.412
and we're like in high
school at a slumber party.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.102
does high school
ever end, uncle saul?

37:12.148 --> 37:15.383
No, Kevin. It's like taxes.
We're doomed to repeat it,

37:15.415 --> 37:16.653
year after year oh,

37:16.688 --> 37:18.383
great.

37:18.427 --> 37:21.591
Well, on that note. Please sign here.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.801
Or I'll be late for algebra.

37:23.836 --> 37:25.542
thank you very much.

37:30.495 --> 37:31.832
morning.

37:31.878 --> 37:34.292
Good morning.

37:35.315 --> 37:37.032
Your kids get back okay?

37:37.078 --> 37:38.672
Yeah, they're already back at school.

37:38.717 --> 37:42.651
Good. I mean, not good that
they're not here anymore

37:43.046 --> 37:45.491
Obviously.

37:48.926 --> 37:50.293
Is there anything else?

37:50.338 --> 37:53.033
Uh, no, we're
- we're all set for the press conference

37:53.065 --> 37:54.873
on the federal funding that we secured.

37:54.908 --> 37:57.290
Yeah, I got the email.

37:58.875 --> 38:02.520
Sorry, if there's anything else? I just have
a lot of reading I've gotta catch up on.

38:08.697 --> 38:11.702
Okay, look, I know that I spewed a
lot of stu at you the other night.

38:11.738 --> 38:15.421
And I don't know, call it
relationship growing pains,

38:15.458 --> 38:17.640
but if you would like to
spew back at me now- -

38:17.687 --> 38:20.991
you accused me of being shallow
and using you to get ahead.

38:21.025 --> 38:23.321
Well, I wasn't
necessarily accusing you.

38:23.355 --> 38:24.841
I was just raising concerns.

38:24.887 --> 38:28.451
Kitty, the thing is, you were
right. I did move fast. I am fast.

38:28.486 --> 38:30.271
Wouldn't be here if I wasn'T.

38:30.315 --> 38:33.851
I get more done by 8:00 A. M. Then most
people do by 8:00 P. M. And I'm proud of it.

38:33.886 --> 38:35.092
No, I
- I know that.

38:35.136 --> 38:36.900
And I've been married. And I have kids.

38:36.938 --> 38:39.202
I don't have time for games.

38:39.236 --> 38:41.042
And maybe you do I me,

38:41.085 --> 38:43.573
god knows, if I'd have looked at
your relationship track record,

38:43.606 --> 38:46.552
I would've run for the
hills, but I didn't,

38:46.597 --> 38:49.511
because I thought
there was a connection.

38:49.545 --> 38:51.373
It felt right.

38:51.418 --> 38:53.083
And I thought you were
right there with me.

38:53.115 --> 38:56.453
I was. I am.

38:56.496 --> 38:58.631
It doesn't feel like it.

38:58.665 --> 39:00.732
Robert, people fight.

39:00.777 --> 39:03.983
And maybe it was just time for us to.

39:04.028 --> 39:06.493
I mean, yes, you're right,
we have different speeds.

39:06.528 --> 39:07.771
We have different temperatures,

39:07.815 --> 39:10.443
but I had to tell you
what I was feeling

39:10.475 --> 39:12.920
and where I was at.

39:14.595 --> 39:16.280
All right.

39:16.325 --> 39:20.393
Well, now I gotta
figure out where I'm at.

39:21.606 --> 39:23.943
okay.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.801
Well, if that's it?

39:29.846 --> 39:32.553
Yeah, that's it.

39:39.958 --> 39:43.553
"what she finally had to
admit was that she was angry.

39:43.586 --> 39:45.461
No, furious.

39:45.505 --> 39:47.441
Anything would
set Dora off

39:47.488 --> 39:49.712
a cordless phone that
wasn't fully charged,

39:49.756 --> 39:53.000
the cupboard door that
refused to stay closed"

39:53.037 --> 39:54.702
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
this is really stupid.

39:54.736 --> 39:56.372
I never had a chance
to read it through.

39:56.405 --> 40:00.341
No, no, no, no, keep going.

40:12.526 --> 40:17.242
"she was even angry at her
kids just for being like her

40:17.285 --> 40:21.973
stubborn, inhuman and always
refusing to let things go."

40:22.657 --> 40:23.510
it's grandma.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.641
"she was especially angry
how they got their own way

40:30.687 --> 40:34.602
"risking happiness by shutting
out the ones they loved the most."

40:34.638 --> 40:37.942
So nice picture of you
online. You give good photo.

40:37.985 --> 40:42.141
Surprise, surprise although, your friend
layla looks a little buzzed for my taste.

40:42.516 --> 40:44.653
Hope you didn't ply her
with mojitos all night.

40:44.686 --> 40:48.091
Anyway, enough of my cattiness. Call me?

40:50.186 --> 40:55.780
"of course, dora was furious
at someone far more difficult to face.

40:57.086 --> 40:59.081
Someone they had trusted,

40:59.116 --> 41:01.040
someone who had loved them

41:01.086 --> 41:06.092
and let'em and finally
betrayed them all.

41:40.288 --> 41:41.972
when a husband dies,

41:42.017 --> 41:45.260
you're supposed to be
able to mourn your loss.

41:45.305 --> 41:48.522
You're supposed to
grieve, but she could not.

41:48.558 --> 41:51.342
He had robbed her of that option.

41:51.378 --> 41:52.943
So instead,

41:52.986 --> 41:56.470
dora did the only thing left to do.

41:56.925 --> 41:59.533
She said goodbye."
