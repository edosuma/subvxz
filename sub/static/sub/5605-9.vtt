00:03.337 --> 00:06.438
Okay, I understand apple,
blueberry, and pumpkin,

00:06.440 --> 00:08.606
but why do you always
make a rhubarb pie?

00:08.608 --> 00:09.773
Nobody likes it.
-Mnh-mnh.

00:09.775 --> 00:13.709
Yeah.
It's the Oakland of pies.

00:13.711 --> 00:15.777
I like it.

00:15.779 --> 00:17.612
We used to fight over it
when I was a kid.

00:17.614 --> 00:20.615
Sometimes it was
quite the "rhubarb."

00:20.617 --> 00:23.618
Are you "pumpkin"
kiddin' me?

00:23.620 --> 00:25.553
Okay, but, mom,
why all of this

00:25.555 --> 00:28.055
when it's just gonna be
you, Dad, and Eve?

00:28.057 --> 00:29.656
Well, this is
Eve's last Thanksgiving

00:29.658 --> 00:31.457
before she goes off
to college,

00:31.459 --> 00:33.292
and it is my job
as a mother

00:33.294 --> 00:36.128
to make sure she
misses the hell out of us.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.496
Well,
I wanted to be here,

00:37.498 --> 00:39.197
but the restaurant
will be packed.

00:39.199 --> 00:40.565
Can't ask
my entire staff to work

00:40.567 --> 00:42.133
and then take
the night off.

00:42.135 --> 00:44.668
That "we're all one big team"
speech I gave last week

00:44.670 --> 00:46.970
is really biting me
in the ass.

00:46.972 --> 00:48.538
I would
totally rather be here

00:48.540 --> 00:50.640
than having dinner
with Kyle's grandmother.

00:50.642 --> 00:52.508
Apparently,
as people get older,

00:52.510 --> 00:55.143
they lose interest in chewing
with their mouth closed.

00:55.979 --> 00:58.479
Well, it'll be like
you guys are here in spirit.

00:58.481 --> 01:00.047
In fact, you know what?

01:00.049 --> 01:02.549
I'm gonna put you at the top
of my Gratitude List

01:02.551 --> 01:04.918
so that when I read this
tomorrow at dinner,

01:04.920 --> 01:06.219
it'll be like you're here.

01:06.221 --> 01:08.054
-Aww, thanks, Mom.
-Yeah.

01:08.056 --> 01:11.924
Really, it means a lot that you
put us above Epsom salts.

01:11.926 --> 01:14.359
Hey, Dad,
can I ask you something?

01:14.361 --> 01:16.561
"May I ask you
something?"

01:16.563 --> 01:17.728
And no.

01:17.730 --> 01:20.397
Grammar --
always hilarious.

01:20.399 --> 01:23.433
So, Amy's parents are taking her
to winter park tomorrow.

01:23.435 --> 01:25.334
Can I go?
-Do I have to pay anything?

01:25.336 --> 01:27.269
-No.
-Do I have to drive anywhere?

01:27.271 --> 01:28.837
They're gonna
pick me up.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.406
Okay,
it's good by me.

01:31.408 --> 01:33.107
But I'm gonna have to check
with your mom.

01:33.109 --> 01:34.241
It's the holidays.
-Ugh.

01:34.243 --> 01:37.177
I like
to give her a vote.

01:37.179 --> 01:39.913
Much as parents love
seeing their kids grow up,

01:39.915 --> 01:43.816
those empty chairs at the table
still kind of break your heart.

01:47.188 --> 01:49.354
Sorry, kid.
I did everything I could.

01:49.356 --> 01:51.556
What?

-- Captions by VITAC --

01:54.561 --> 01:57.962
â™ªâ™ª

01:57.964 --> 01:59.763
But for some reason,

01:59.765 --> 02:02.532
Turkey tastes better
when you kill it yourself.

02:02.534 --> 02:04.133
N-not lamb, though.
No.

02:04.135 --> 02:07.369
It's tough to get that cute
little face out of your head.

02:07.371 --> 02:09.371
That's why it's so easy
to eat crabs.

02:09.373 --> 02:10.638
They look like jerks.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.106
Ah. You're right.

02:12.108 --> 02:14.074
I'm going up to the cabin
for the holiday

02:14.076 --> 02:15.375
to work on my novel.

02:15.377 --> 02:17.210
It's --
it's about a sad man

02:17.212 --> 02:21.246
who spends Thanksgiving
all alone in his cabin.

02:21.248 --> 02:22.547
You want to come?

02:22.549 --> 02:25.616
Uh, that sounds great,
but, uh, Mandy and I

02:25.618 --> 02:27.951
are having Thanksgiving
together -- just the two of us.

02:27.953 --> 02:29.886
-Ah.
-I'm -- I'm sorry.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.255
<i> Just</i> you and Mandy?
Really?

02:32.257 --> 02:35.725
Yeah, we're having
Cornish game hens and lasagna.

02:35.727 --> 02:38.094
Lasagna
on Thanksgiving?

02:38.096 --> 02:40.096
Oh, yeah, no, we know about
the pilgrims and everything,

02:40.098 --> 02:42.932
but Columbus was here first
with a bunch of Italians,

02:42.934 --> 02:45.434
so somebody
was having lasagna.

02:45.436 --> 02:47.335
[ Groans ]

02:47.337 --> 02:49.270
Hey, Kris.

02:49.272 --> 02:50.337
Where's Kyle?

02:50.339 --> 02:52.405
Uh, he's helping Ed.

02:52.407 --> 02:54.140
Hey, you know,
I just wanted to say,

02:54.142 --> 02:56.342
I think it's so nice,
what you guys are doing --

02:56.344 --> 02:59.078
spending the day with Kyle's
grandma at her retirement home.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.480
Yeah, well, old people
love attention

03:01.482 --> 03:03.949
and pudding...

03:03.951 --> 03:06.084
And CBS.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.653
You're, uh, really making
a sacrifice.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.821
I know, but the way I look
at it, it's Thanksgiving.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.088
It's not "Thanks-taking."

03:12.090 --> 03:14.123
Yeah, sometimes
it's "Thanks-lying."

03:14.125 --> 03:16.592
I don't think
that's a thing.

03:16.594 --> 03:19.361
You -- you and Kyle aren't gonna
be with his grandma.

03:19.363 --> 03:20.428
You lied to Mom.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.962
[ Flatly ] Oh, no.

03:21.964 --> 03:25.532
Don't tell Santa, or I won't get
that bike I asked for.

03:25.534 --> 03:27.033
Kyle!

03:27.035 --> 03:29.468
Mandy, y-you saw how upset
Mom was yesterday.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.503
Maybe I only get this
because I'm a mom now,

03:31.505 --> 03:33.605
but families spending
the holidays together --

03:33.607 --> 03:35.139
it means a lot.

03:35.141 --> 03:37.341
That's why Ryan and Boyd
are eating here tonight.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.142
Well,
Kyle is basically family.

03:39.144 --> 03:41.177
I mean, he thinks of Dad
as a father,

03:41.179 --> 03:42.711
which makes
me and Kyle --

03:42.713 --> 03:45.447
okay, went down
a blind alley there.

03:45.449 --> 03:48.983
Look, Kyle and I are starting
our own new tradition.

03:48.985 --> 03:50.884
Mom would understand.
-Hey.

03:50.886 --> 03:53.119
-Hey, let's go.
-Uh, Ed will be right out.

03:53.121 --> 03:55.721
He's in the linen closet
getting more tablecloths.

03:55.723 --> 03:58.223
You know,
I'm surprised at you, Kyle.

03:58.225 --> 03:59.757
It's not like you to lie.

04:01.727 --> 04:03.493
You're right.

04:03.495 --> 04:06.928
Ed's in the bathroom again.
He asked me not to say anything.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.464
Kyle doesn't know.

04:10.466 --> 04:11.898
Didn't know.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.199
Whatever, let's go.

04:13.201 --> 04:15.301
Well, hope you
enjoy your lasagna.

04:15.303 --> 04:19.304
Oh, we will.

04:19.306 --> 04:21.306
What are we angry about
again?

04:21.308 --> 04:22.607
Kyle!

04:27.847 --> 04:30.380
Well, honey, smells like
we're about 20 minutes away

04:30.382 --> 04:32.882
from a perfect
Thanksgiving meal.

04:32.884 --> 04:35.484
Actually, we're just about ready
to sit down and eat.

04:35.486 --> 04:37.319
Oh, no.
Trust the nose, honey.

04:37.321 --> 04:40.021
We are 20 minutes away.

04:40.023 --> 04:43.857
Mike, we are not waiting
for halftime.

04:43.859 --> 04:45.592
Damn it.

04:45.594 --> 04:48.194
Just DVR the game.

04:48.196 --> 04:51.330
Wow, it smells like we
are 20 minutes away from --

04:51.332 --> 04:52.831
I already tried it.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.200
Damn it!

04:55.202 --> 04:57.835
-You take that.
-Oh, look at all this food.

04:57.837 --> 04:59.670
You do realize
it's only three of US

04:59.672 --> 05:01.705
And only one of us
has a teenager's metabolism,

05:01.707 --> 05:03.106
if you know what I mean.

05:03.108 --> 05:05.741
Well, at the Baxter house,
we do holidays right.

05:05.743 --> 05:07.409
Besides,
I've got 16 bowls,

05:07.411 --> 05:10.445
and I am using
every one of them.

05:10.447 --> 05:11.946
Eve, honey,
you haven't put

05:11.948 --> 05:13.781
anything
on the Gratitude List yet.

05:13.783 --> 05:15.616
Oh, yeah.
Do we, uh --

05:15.618 --> 05:17.351
do we really
have to do that this year?

05:17.353 --> 05:20.220
What do you mean?
It's tradition.

05:20.222 --> 05:22.055
Well, I know,
but, I mean, let's face it.

05:22.057 --> 05:24.023
I-it's kind of goofy.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.958
[ Chuckles ]
Goofy?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.093
Yeah.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.796
Well, I guess I-I've never seen
being grateful as goofy.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.864
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean goofy.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.432
That would imply
that there was

05:35.434 --> 05:37.066
some sort
of entertainment value.

05:37.068 --> 05:39.802
I love hearing
what my family is grateful for.

05:39.804 --> 05:42.237
Yeah, well,
maybe just a little too much.

05:42.239 --> 05:43.805
Y-you get
kind of emotional,

05:43.807 --> 05:45.773
and your tears get
into the stuffing.

05:45.775 --> 05:48.275
That may be
a health-code violation.

05:48.277 --> 05:50.210
Uh, fine, fine.

05:50.212 --> 05:51.811
If, uh --
if you don't want to do it,

05:51.813 --> 05:52.878
we don't have to do it.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.980
Okay, cool. Thanks.

05:54.982 --> 05:57.548
Um, I'll go get Dad.

06:00.419 --> 06:01.885
[ Sighs ]

06:15.433 --> 06:17.099
You keep doing that,

06:17.101 --> 06:18.867
that countertop
is gonna burst into flame.

06:21.605 --> 06:22.837
Listen, I'm just taking
a wild guess here,

06:22.839 --> 06:24.471
but you're upset
about something?

06:24.473 --> 06:27.807
Did you notice anything missing
at dinner tonight?

06:27.809 --> 06:30.810
Uh...

06:30.812 --> 06:32.311
You usually make
biscuits.

06:32.313 --> 06:33.979
Oh, crap!

06:38.818 --> 06:40.417
Well,
other than those, uh,

06:40.419 --> 06:42.619
charcoal briquettes,
what's missing?

06:42.621 --> 06:44.754
The Gratitude List.

06:44.756 --> 06:47.857
Oh, that explains why dinner
was hot when we ate it.

06:47.859 --> 06:49.158
I thought
you didn't do that

06:49.160 --> 06:50.526
just 'cause the other girls
weren't here.

06:50.528 --> 06:53.762
No, Eve asked
that we not do it this year.

06:53.764 --> 06:55.797
She said it was goofy.

06:55.799 --> 06:58.266
Well, if we're eliminating
goofy things, I've got a list.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.770
I worked really hard to make
this last Thanksgiving

07:03.772 --> 07:06.105
before she goes off to college
nice,

07:06.107 --> 07:07.973
but is she grateful?

07:07.975 --> 07:09.374
No, apparently not.

07:09.376 --> 07:10.808
Come on, honey.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.543
All the girls were like that
when they're 17.

07:12.545 --> 07:13.944
The grateful part
of their brain

07:13.946 --> 07:16.179
is a little undercooked,
unlike those biscuits.

07:16.181 --> 07:18.014
You know what? Just go.
Go watch your game.

07:18.016 --> 07:19.382
I'm gonna talk to Eve.

07:19.384 --> 07:21.050
No, no. Don't do that.
Don't do that, Mike.

07:21.052 --> 07:22.885
No, it -- I am not gonna
feel better

07:22.887 --> 07:24.953
if somebody has to tell her
to apologize.

07:24.955 --> 07:27.488
I<i> will</i> feel better if she
just realizes it on her own.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.790
But I think
kids realize things

07:29.792 --> 07:32.626
when parents tell them
those things really loud.

07:32.628 --> 07:35.562
I do not want you
to fix this, okay?

07:35.564 --> 07:36.729
I'm just telling you
how I feel.

07:36.731 --> 07:37.830
Just respect that,
all right?

07:37.832 --> 07:38.864
-All right.
-Yeah, okay.

07:38.866 --> 07:39.965
-Great dinner.
-Thanks.

07:44.537 --> 07:48.071
You, my den, now.

07:55.346 --> 07:57.412
When Mom's feelings get hurt,
what's the best thing to do?

07:57.414 --> 08:00.348
Mm, flowers, candy,
something shiny?

08:00.350 --> 08:02.350
I don't know.
This is your problem, old man.

08:02.352 --> 08:04.218
I didn't do anything.
You did.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.752
Me?

08:05.754 --> 08:08.387
Listen, you crapped all over
the Gratitude List.

08:08.389 --> 08:09.888
You called it goofy?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.556
Well, it kind of is.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.025
But you said it.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.227
But she said she was fine
with not doing it.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.230
You know, you can't always go
by what your mom says.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.366
It's what makes living with her
so interesting.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.501
Okay, well, I totally did not
mean to hurt her feelings.

08:24.503 --> 08:25.731
I'll just tell her we
talked, and I'll apologize.

08:25.757 --> 08:26.236
No, no, no, no, Eve.

08:26.238 --> 08:27.537
Don't do that.
That's not a good idea.

08:27.539 --> 08:28.771
If she found out
I was doing something

08:28.773 --> 08:29.838
to make her happy,
she'd kill me.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.740
Like I said --
interesting.

08:33.742 --> 08:35.775
Okay, so,
what should I do?

08:35.777 --> 08:37.376
The holiday's been going
real good. Dinner was great.

08:37.378 --> 08:38.944
Just tell her that. Tell her
everything was wonderful.

08:38.946 --> 08:40.278
Yeah,
dinner was perfect,

08:40.280 --> 08:42.046
although sometimes
we have biscuits.

08:42.048 --> 08:44.548
No, no, no, no, we're not
gonna talk about the biscuits.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.082
Maybe you guys
could watch a movie.

08:46.084 --> 08:48.117
She used to love to do that
when you were little.

08:48.119 --> 08:50.419
Okay, anything
but "Mamma Mia!," though.

08:50.421 --> 08:52.421
She sings along, Dad.

08:52.423 --> 08:55.090
You didn't have to go see it
in the theater with her.

08:55.092 --> 08:56.891
She started singing
"Dancing Queen."

08:56.893 --> 08:58.926
I went to get popcorn.
I never came back.

09:03.132 --> 09:04.865
Do you want more wine?

09:04.867 --> 09:06.566
Uh, no.

09:06.568 --> 09:07.967
Yeah, me neither.

09:07.969 --> 09:09.635
I don't like it as much
since I turned 21.

09:11.071 --> 09:14.572
But let's toast
to your grandmother --

09:14.574 --> 09:17.374
the reason we can have our first
Thanksgiving alone together.

09:17.376 --> 09:19.876
Yay.

09:19.878 --> 09:23.646
Don't you mean, "Yay!"?

09:23.648 --> 09:25.147
I feel
a little uncomfortable

09:25.149 --> 09:27.649
about being a part of this lie
you told your parents.

09:27.651 --> 09:32.319
Do you mean the lie I told them
or the gift I gave them?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.887
Oh, great.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.722
We lied to them and I forgot
to get them a gift?

09:35.724 --> 09:38.391
No.
The lie is the gift.

09:38.393 --> 09:41.627
Look, lying gets a bad rap,
but sometimes it's a good thing.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.061
Like, today -- I lied,

09:43.063 --> 09:45.430
and we get
to have Thanksgiving together,

09:45.432 --> 09:46.898
which makes us happy.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.666
My mom thinks we're
with your grandmother,

09:48.668 --> 09:50.134
which makes my mom happy.

09:50.136 --> 09:52.269
And we'll just tell your
grandmother we spent the day

09:52.271 --> 09:54.170
with her since she
won't know the difference.

09:55.173 --> 09:57.273
All of these
heartwarming moments

09:57.275 --> 10:00.809
brought to you
by the lie.

10:00.811 --> 10:03.111
I-I guess
I always thought

10:03.113 --> 10:05.613
that honesty
was the best policy,

10:05.615 --> 10:09.583
although Outdoor Man's
return policy is a close second.

10:09.585 --> 10:11.184
Think about it.

10:11.186 --> 10:13.319
When somebody says,
"Can I be honest with you,"

10:13.321 --> 10:16.088
what they're really saying is,
"Hey, can I hurt your feelings?"

10:16.090 --> 10:18.523
At least they were
nice enough to ask.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.825
All I know is,
when I lied to my mom,

10:20.827 --> 10:23.194
she was beaming
with pride.

10:23.196 --> 10:24.495
What kind
of a monster would I be

10:24.497 --> 10:25.796
to take that away
from her?

10:25.798 --> 10:28.165
Well, I'm happy
that you're happy

10:28.167 --> 10:30.600
and that it makes you
feel so good

10:30.602 --> 10:33.703
to have your mother
think you're a good person.

10:33.705 --> 10:37.506
I am a good person.

10:37.508 --> 10:39.541
Right?

10:41.478 --> 10:43.044
Can I be honest
with you?

10:48.651 --> 10:50.651
Thanksgiving night --

10:50.653 --> 10:52.919
already five neighbors
have their Christmas lights up.

10:54.489 --> 10:56.789
You know what
I feel like doing?

10:56.791 --> 10:58.490
Finding
some well-fed dogs,

10:58.492 --> 11:00.425
get some paper bags,
and stick matches.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.528
Well, you're in luck.
Muffin's good to go.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.998
Got into the leftovers
and ate half a pie.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.966
Sound like you're in
a better mood. [ Shivers ]

11:09.968 --> 11:11.968
I am, I am.

11:11.970 --> 11:15.004
Our lovely daughter just said
some wonderful things to me.

11:15.006 --> 11:17.506
Well, you can add that to
your Gratitude List. Yeah.

11:17.508 --> 11:19.508
Eve told me how much
she appreciated

11:19.510 --> 11:21.343
the wonderful dinner
I made,

11:21.345 --> 11:23.745
and then she asked if I wanted
to watch a movie with her.

11:23.747 --> 11:26.748
-Great, "Mamma Mia!"?
-Yeah.

11:26.750 --> 11:30.884
I wanted that one,
but Eve told me she just saw it.

11:30.886 --> 11:32.218
Ah.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.686
She said she's got
the perfect

11:33.688 --> 11:35.087
Thanksgiving movie --
"Hostel."

11:35.089 --> 11:37.222
I guess...

11:37.224 --> 11:41.259
it's some kind
of travel film.

11:41.261 --> 11:42.727
Yeah.

11:42.729 --> 11:46.263
I'm happy for you.

11:46.265 --> 11:48.164
Even though
you were wrong?

11:48.166 --> 11:49.665
Wrong?

11:49.667 --> 11:53.068
Mike, you wanted to fix this
by confronting Eve.

11:53.070 --> 11:56.371
I thought she would realize she
upset me and fix it herself.

11:56.373 --> 11:57.739
I was right.

11:57.741 --> 11:59.941
Certainly would appear
that way.

11:59.943 --> 12:03.210
Come on.
You always want to confront.

12:03.212 --> 12:04.744
I mean, look at the way
you just reacted

12:04.746 --> 12:06.112
to the neighbors'
Christmas lights.

12:06.114 --> 12:09.215
For the love of God,
it's Thanksgiving!

12:09.217 --> 12:10.549
Really, Mike?

12:10.551 --> 12:12.083
You can't look me
in the eye

12:12.085 --> 12:13.918
and just say three
little words --

12:13.920 --> 12:18.421
"I was wrong"?

12:18.423 --> 12:20.890
I...

12:20.892 --> 12:22.224
did...

12:22.226 --> 12:23.491
this.

12:25.461 --> 12:27.194
What?
What are you talking about?

12:27.196 --> 12:30.096
I confronted Eve.
I told her to apologize.

12:30.098 --> 12:32.998
This is how
Mike fixes Thanksgiving.

12:35.035 --> 12:37.602
Why would you do that
when I asked you not to?

12:37.604 --> 12:39.570
I've done it with all the girls
since they were little.

12:39.572 --> 12:41.071
You're welcome.

12:41.073 --> 12:42.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute, what?

12:42.941 --> 12:44.941
Are you telling me
that every time

12:44.943 --> 12:46.542
they apologized,
they didn't mean it?

12:46.544 --> 12:48.310
Who the hell cares
whether they mean it or not?

12:48.312 --> 12:50.812
[ Stammers ] The point is to
make them feel bad, right?

12:50.814 --> 12:52.446
No, what?

12:52.448 --> 12:54.948
Hey, mom, do you want me
to make popcorn for the movie?

12:54.950 --> 12:57.583
Uh, no, Eve, I don't think there's
going to be a movie... Don't --

12:57.585 --> 13:00.285
...because your father
just told me the truth.

13:00.287 --> 13:04.121
[ Sighs ] Okay, yes,
"Hostel" is a horror film.

13:05.324 --> 13:07.057
But if you can look past
the dismembering,

13:07.059 --> 13:09.059
Slovakia is beautiful.

13:09.061 --> 13:13.062
Eve, you apologized
because your dad told you to.

13:13.064 --> 13:15.097
-You told her?
-Hey, you know, this is fun.

13:15.099 --> 13:17.599
Why don't we yell at Mike
every Thanksgiving?

13:17.601 --> 13:19.167
Okay, wait, so,
you tell me to apologize,

13:19.169 --> 13:20.568
and then you take credit
for it.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.403
That's pretty low, Dad.
-Unbelievable.

13:22.405 --> 13:24.138
Whoa, wait, wait. Unbelievable,
Mike, just unbelievable!

13:24.140 --> 13:25.606
Wait a minute, hold it!
You know what?!

13:25.608 --> 13:27.341
You know what?!

13:27.343 --> 13:29.176
I'm gonna go into my den
and watch football,

13:29.178 --> 13:30.877
and I'm gonna think about
what I've done!

13:40.822 --> 13:43.622
Honey, don't fold laundry
when you're mad.

13:43.624 --> 13:45.756
It just undoes the work
of the fabric softener.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.125
Honey, I'm sorry.

13:49.127 --> 13:52.261
Mike, I specifically asked you
not to talk to her.

13:52.263 --> 13:55.530
And I specifically
am saying I'm sorry.

13:55.532 --> 13:58.266
It just undercuts everything
we should be doing as parents.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.700
Why is that?

13:59.702 --> 14:01.268
Eve did something wrong.
I got her to apologize.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.636
Isn't that what we wanted?
No, no, Mike.

14:02.638 --> 14:04.004
[ Scoffs ]

14:04.006 --> 14:06.006
I want to know
that our girls have learned

14:06.008 --> 14:08.174
to do the right thing
without you forcing them.

14:08.176 --> 14:10.242
I get that,
but isn't my way faster?

14:12.012 --> 14:13.644
No. Honey, that might have
worked when they were little,

14:13.646 --> 14:15.145
but they're grown now,

14:15.147 --> 14:17.147
and you are not always
gonna be there to fix things.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.715
Neither am I.

14:18.717 --> 14:21.484
Well, technically,
you're not fixing things now.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.885
Yeah, fine.
[ Door opens ]

14:22.887 --> 14:25.821

Everything all right at the store?

14:27.991 --> 14:30.858
Oh, yeah, we are super busy,
but I just took a quick break.

Something about a holiday that
makes you want to see your mama.

14:40.868 --> 14:42.500
-Kris.
-Yeah?

14:42.502 --> 14:44.702
Thank you for that.

14:44.704 --> 14:47.538
Um, you can't possibly know
how much that means to me...

14:47.540 --> 14:49.039
Especially today.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.907
We have a little situation
with your sister.

14:50.909 --> 14:53.743
Oh.
You know about that?

14:53.745 --> 14:56.679
See, this is why
Mandy should never lie.

14:56.681 --> 14:58.881
She's really bad at it.

14:58.883 --> 15:00.449
Mandy?
Mandy?

15:02.386 --> 15:05.220
And why I should
never tell the truth.

15:08.925 --> 15:10.925
I think it is safe
to say

15:10.927 --> 15:14.495
that this is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.697
I say we look
for the positive in this.

15:16.699 --> 15:18.765
The positive?
[ Scoffs ]

15:18.767 --> 15:22.034
Eve tells me that
the Gratitude List is goofy.

15:22.036 --> 15:24.002
Mandy lies to get out
of eating with us.

15:24.004 --> 15:25.570
If it wasn't
for our daughter

15:25.572 --> 15:27.271
that got pregnant
in high school,

15:27.273 --> 15:29.539
I would say we failed
as parents.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.774
But doesn't this give us
a chance to see

15:31.776 --> 15:35.177
if one of our kids will do the
right thing all by themselves?

15:35.179 --> 15:36.711
What
are you talking about?

15:36.713 --> 15:38.079
-Well, Mandy lied.
-Yeah.

15:38.081 --> 15:39.847
If she comes clean,

15:39.849 --> 15:43.383
I will say those three words
you've been waiting to hear --

15:43.385 --> 15:45.351
"We were right."

15:50.090 --> 15:52.256
So, how do we
get Mandy to confess?

15:52.258 --> 15:54.191
Should we --
should we do good cop, bad cop?

15:54.193 --> 15:55.926
No, no, no, no, no.
We can't make her do it.

15:55.928 --> 15:57.961
She has to do it
on her own.

15:57.963 --> 16:00.129
Let's get her drunk.
That'll work.

16:00.131 --> 16:02.764

a few pops.

behind my back, you fail me!

[ Sighs ] I asked you not
to do it, you do it.

to spend time

dinner with family
to be with her.

Yeah, I don't want
to say anything else.

of bourbon?

No, she doesn't want a shot of bourbon!

to you for a second?

Yeah, because
we're horrible parents.

There's pie.
Go stuff your face.

with feelings.

sharing them...

talking about?

I was gonna put one word
on the list -- "family."

18:15.195 --> 18:18.563
But then you'd ask me what
I meant and I'd have to explain

18:18.565 --> 18:21.198
and then I'd be knee-deep
in feelings.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.466
Well, what did you mean
by "family"?

just don't look at me, okay?

18:37.479 --> 18:40.713
Okay, okay,
honey, look at the floor. Stare.

18:40.715 --> 18:42.648
Look at the floor.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.821
I've been thinking a lot about
going to college next year

18:50.823 --> 18:54.491
and all the things
that I'm gonna miss --

18:54.493 --> 18:59.028
Dad's joking
and his serious talks,

18:59.030 --> 19:01.063
Mom's terrible puns

19:01.065 --> 19:03.031
and how she never stops
thinking about us.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.732
-Oh, honey.
-Mom.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.633
Sorry, sorry.

19:08.269 --> 19:11.370
[ Voice breaking ]
I'm gonna miss my sisters

19:11.372 --> 19:13.372
and how we fight

19:13.374 --> 19:17.175
and how I know they'd fight
anyone twice as hard for me.

19:17.177 --> 19:19.277
I grew up in this
really terrific, safe place

19:19.279 --> 19:20.945
where it didn't matter
how I behaved.

19:20.947 --> 19:23.847
I was still loved.

19:23.849 --> 19:26.049
And I'm grateful
that when I leave,

19:26.051 --> 19:29.619
I'm gonna miss you all and your
goofy traditions so, so much

19:29.621 --> 19:32.254
because
that pain of missing you

19:32.256 --> 19:36.190
is just proof it was perfect
in so many ways.

19:36.192 --> 19:38.692
Can I look up now?

19:38.694 --> 19:41.695
Because I want to hug you,
and I don't want to miss.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.301
So...
We are good parents.

19:53.773 --> 19:57.040
At this point,
I'll take two out of three.

19:57.042 --> 19:58.574
I can't take it.
I lied.

19:58.576 --> 20:01.877
Kyle and I didn't spend
Thanksgiving with his grandma.

20:01.879 --> 20:05.780
See, honey?
You're right. She lied.

20:08.317 --> 20:11.117
Oh, Mandy,
I'm so proud of you.

20:11.119 --> 20:14.053
We were right.

20:21.328 --> 20:24.228
-Hey, there.
-Hey.

20:24.230 --> 20:27.064
It's technically still
Thanksgiving until 12:00,

20:27.066 --> 20:29.733
so I can stuff my face
till then.

20:29.735 --> 20:31.568
Mmm.
Yeah.

20:31.570 --> 20:34.637
And since it still
is technically Thanksgiving,

20:34.639 --> 20:38.774
it's a perfect time
to do the Gratitude List.

20:38.776 --> 20:41.676
Great.

20:41.678 --> 20:44.445
I'm eating pie, so you --
you start.

20:44.447 --> 20:46.814
Okay, all right,
well, uh...

20:46.816 --> 20:52.118
I am grateful for hot tea
on cold mornings,

20:52.120 --> 20:55.121
sunrise and sunset,

20:55.123 --> 20:57.423
the sound
of children's laughter.

20:57.425 --> 20:59.992
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:59.994 --> 21:04.996
I am especially thankful
for my incredible partner --

21:04.998 --> 21:07.264
yes --
who has helped me raise

21:07.266 --> 21:10.700
three amazing,
caring children.

21:10.702 --> 21:14.703
We've done a fabulous job,
and there is no one

21:14.705 --> 21:18.039
I would rather
spend my life with than you.

21:24.513 --> 21:26.446
Ditto.
