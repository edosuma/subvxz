It's the Oakland of pies.

We used to fight over it
when I was a kid.

to college,

as a mother

Yeah, me neither.

09:07.969 --> 09:09.635
I don't like it as much
since I turned 21.

09:11.071 --> 09:14.572
But let's toast
to your grandmother --

09:14.574 --> 09:17.374
the reason we can have our first
Thanksgiving alone together.

09:17.376 --> 09:19.876
Yay.

09:19.878 --> 09:23.646
Don't you mean, "Yay!"?

09:23.648 --> 09:25.147
I feel
a little uncomfortable

09:25.149 --> 09:27.649
about being a part of this lie
you told your parents.

09:27.651 --> 09:32.319
Do you mean the lie I told them
or the gift I gave them?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.887
Oh, great.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.722
We lied to them and I forgot
to get them a gift?

09:35.724 --> 09:38.391
No.
The lie is the gift.

09:38.393 --> 09:41.627
Look, lying gets a bad rap,
but sometimes it's a good thing.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.061
Like, today -- I lied,

09:43.063 --> 09:45.430
and we get
to have Thanksgiving together,

09:45.432 --> 09:46.898
which makes us happy.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.666
My mom thinks we're
with your grandmother,

09:48.668 --> 09:50.134
which makes my mom happy.

09:50.136 --> 09:52.269
And we'll just tell your
grandmother we spent the day

09:52.271 --> 09:54.170
with her since she
won't know the difference.

09:55.173 --> 09:57.273
All of these
heartwarming moments

09:57.275 --> 10:00.809
brought to you
by the lie.

10:00.811 --> 10:03.111
I-I guess
I always thought

10:03.113 --> 10:05.613
that honesty
was the best policy,

10:05.615 --> 10:09.583
although Outdoor Man's
return policy is a close second.

10:09.585 --> 10:11.184
Think about it.

10:11.186 --> 10:13.319
When somebody says,
"Can I be honest with you,"

10:13.321 --> 10:16.088
what they're really saying is,
"Hey, can I hurt your feelings?"

10:16.090 --> 10:18.523
At least they were
nice enough to ask.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.825
All I know is,
when I lied to my mom,

10:20.827 --> 10:23.194
she was beaming
with pride.

10:23.196 --> 10:24.495
What kind
of a monster would I be

10:24.497 --> 10:25.796
to take that away
from her?

10:25.798 --> 10:28.165
Well, I'm happy
that you're happy

10:28.167 --> 10:30.600
and that it makes you
feel so good

10:30.602 --> 10:33.703
to have your mother
think you're a good person.

10:33.705 --> 10:37.506
I am a good person.

10:37.508 --> 10:39.541
Right?

10:41.478 --> 10:43.044
Can I be honest
with you?

10:48.651 --> 10:50.651
Thanksgiving night --

10:50.653 --> 10:52.919
already five neighbors
have their Christmas lights up.

10:54.489 --> 10:56.789
You know what
I feel like doing?

10:56.791 --> 10:58.490
Finding
some well-fed dogs,

10:58.492 --> 11:00.425
get some paper bags,
and stick matches.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.528
Well, you're in luck.
Muffin's good to go.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.998
Got into the leftovers
and ate half a pie.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.966
Sound like you're in
a better mood. [ Shivers ]

11:09.968 --> 11:11.968
I am, I am.

11:11.970 --> 11:15.004
Our lovely daughter just said
some wonderful things to me.

11:15.006 --> 11:17.506
Well, you can add that to
your Gratitude List. Yeah.

11:17.508 --> 11:19.508
Eve told me how much
she appreciated

11:19.510 --> 11:21.343
the wonderful dinner
I made,

11:21.345 --> 11:23.745
and then she asked if I wanted
to watch a movie with her.

11:23.747 --> 11:26.748
-Great, "Mamma Mia!"?
-Yeah.

11:26.750 --> 11:30.884
I wanted that one,
but Eve told me she just saw it.

11:30.886 --> 11:32.218
Ah.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.686
She said she's got
the perfect

11:33.688 --> 11:35.087
Thanksgiving movie --
"Hostel."

11:35.089 --> 11:37.222
I guess...

11:37.224 --> 11:41.259
it's some kind
of travel film.

11:41.261 --> 11:42.727
Yeah.

11:42.729 --> 11:46.263
I'm happy for you.

11:46.265 --> 11:48.164
Even though
you were wrong?

11:48.166 --> 11:49.665
Wrong?

11:49.667 --> 11:53.068
Mike, you wanted to fix this
by confronting Eve.

11:53.070 --> 11:56.371
I thought she would realize she
upset me and fix it herself.

11:56.373 --> 11:57.739
I was right.

11:57.741 --> 11:59.941
Certainly would appear
that way.

11:59.943 --> 12:03.210
Come on.
You always want to confront.

12:03.212 --> 12:04.744
I mean, look at the way
you just reacted

12:04.746 --> 12:06.112
to the neighbors'
Christmas lights.

12:06.114 --> 12:09.215
For the love of God,
it's Thanksgiving!

12:09.217 --> 12:10.549
Really, Mike?

12:10.551 --> 12:12.083
You can't look me
in the eye

12:12.085 --> 12:13.918
and just say three
little words --

12:13.920 --> 12:18.421
"I was wrong"?

12:18.423 --> 12:20.890
I...

12:20.892 --> 12:22.224
did...

12:22.226 --> 12:23.491
this.

12:25.461 --> 12:27.194
What?
What are you talking about?

12:27.196 --> 12:30.096
I confronted Eve.
I told her to apologize.

12:30.098 --> 12:32.998
This is how
Mike fixes Thanksgiving.

12:35.035 --> 12:37.602
Why would you do that
when I asked you not to?

12:37.604 --> 12:39.570
I've done it with all the girls
since they were little.

12:39.572 --> 12:41.071
You're welcome.

12:41.073 --> 12:42.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute, what?

12:42.941 --> 12:44.941
Are you telling me
that every time

12:44.943 --> 12:46.542
they apologized,
they didn't mean it?

12:46.544 --> 12:48.310
Who the hell cares
whether they mean it or not?

12:48.312 --> 12:50.812
[ Stammers ] The point is to
make them feel bad, right?

12:50.814 --> 12:52.446
No, what?

12:52.448 --> 12:54.948
Hey, mom, do you want me
to make popcorn for the movie?

12:54.950 --> 12:57.583
Uh, no, Eve, I don't think there's
going to be a movie... Don't --

12:57.585 --> 13:00.285
...because your father
just told me the truth.

13:00.287 --> 13:04.121
[ Sighs ] Okay, yes,
"Hostel" is a horror film.

13:05.324 --> 13:07.057
But if you can look past
the dismembering,

13:07.059 --> 13:09.059
Slovakia is beautiful.

13:09.061 --> 13:13.062
Eve, you apologized
because your dad told you to.

13:13.064 --> 13:15.097
-You told her?
-Hey, you know, this is fun.

13:15.099 --> 13:17.599
Why don't we yell at Mike
every Thanksgiving?

13:17.601 --> 13:19.167
Okay, wait, so,
you tell me to apologize,

13:19.169 --> 13:20.568
and then you take credit
for it.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.403
That's pretty low, Dad.
-Unbelievable.

13:22.405 --> 13:24.138
Whoa, wait, wait. Unbelievable,
Mike, just unbelievable!

13:24.140 --> 13:25.606
Wait a minute, hold it!
You know what?!

13:25.608 --> 13:27.341
You know what?!

13:27.343 --> 13:29.176
I'm gonna go into my den
and watch football,

13:29.178 --> 13:30.877
and I'm gonna think about
what I've done!

13:40.822 --> 13:43.622
Honey, don't fold laundry
when you're mad.

13:43.624 --> 13:45.756
It just undoes the work
of the fabric softener.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.125
Honey, I'm sorry.

13:49.127 --> 13:52.261
Mike, I specifically asked you
not to talk to her.

13:52.263 --> 13:55.530
And I specifically
am saying I'm sorry.

13:55.532 --> 13:58.266
It just undercuts everything
we should be doing as parents.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.700
Why is that?

13:59.702 --> 14:01.268
Eve did something wrong.
I got her to apologize.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.636
Isn't that what we wanted?
No, no, Mike.

14:02.638 --> 14:04.004
[ Scoffs ]

14:04.006 --> 14:06.006
I want to know
that our girls have learned

14:06.008 --> 14:08.174
to do the right thing
without you forcing them.

14:08.176 --> 14:10.242
I get that,
but isn't my way faster?

14:12.012 --> 14:13.644
No. Honey, that might have
worked when they were little,

14:13.646 --> 14:15.145
but they're grown now,

14:15.147 --> 14:17.147
and you are not always
gonna be there to fix things.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.715
Neither am I.

14:18.717 --> 14:21.484
Well, technically,
you're not fixing things now.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.885
Yeah, fine.
[ Door opens ]

14:22.887 --> 14:25.821

Everything all right at the store?

14:27.991 --> 14:30.858
Oh, yeah, we are super busy,
but I just took a quick break.

Something about a holiday that
makes you want to see your mama.

14:40.868 --> 14:42.500
-Kris.
-Yeah?

14:42.502 --> 14:44.702
Thank you for that.

14:44.704 --> 14:47.538
Um, you can't possibly know
how much that means to me...

14:47.540 --> 14:49.039
Especially today.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.907
We have a little situation
with your sister.

14:50.909 --> 14:53.743
Oh.
You know about that?

14:53.745 --> 14:56.679
See, this is why
Mandy should never lie.

14:56.681 --> 14:58.881
She's really bad at it.

14:58.883 --> 15:00.449
Mandy?
Mandy?

15:02.386 --> 15:05.220
And why I should
never tell the truth.

15:08.925 --> 15:10.925
I think it is safe
to say

15:10.927 --> 15:14.495
that this is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.697
I say we look
for the positive in this.

15:16.699 --> 15:18.765
The positive?
[ Scoffs ]

15:18.767 --> 15:22.034
Eve tells me that
the Gratitude List is goofy.

15:22.036 --> 15:24.002
Mandy lies to get out
of eating with us.

15:24.004 --> 15:25.570
If it wasn't
for our daughter

15:25.572 --> 15:27.271
that got pregnant
in high school,

15:27.273 --> 15:29.539
I would say we failed
as parents.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.774
But doesn't this give us
a chance to see

15:31.776 --> 15:35.177
if one of our kids will do the
right thing all by themselves?

15:35.179 --> 15:36.711
What
are you talking about?

15:36.713 --> 15:38.079
-Well, Mandy lied.
-Yeah.

15:38.081 --> 15:39.847
If she comes clean,

15:39.849 --> 15:43.383
I will say those three words
you've been waiting to hear --

15:43.385 --> 15:45.351
"We were right."

15:50.090 --> 15:52.256
So, how do we
get Mandy to confess?

15:52.258 --> 15:54.191
Should we --
should we do good cop, bad cop?

15:54.193 --> 15:55.926
No, no, no, no, no.
We can't make her do it.

15:55.928 --> 15:57.961
She has to do it
on her own.

15:57.963 --> 16:00.129
Let's get her drunk.
That'll work.

16:00.131 --> 16:02.764

a few pops.

behind my back, you fail me!

[ Sighs ] I asked you not
to do it, you do it.

to spend time

dinner with family
to be with her.

Yeah, I don't want
to say anything else.

of bourbon?

No, she doesn't want a shot of bourbon!

to you for a second?

Yeah, because
we're horrible parents.

There's pie.
Go stuff your face.

with feelings.

sharing them...

talking about?

I was gonna put one word
on the list -- "family."

18:15.195 --> 18:18.563
But then you'd ask me what
I meant and I'd have to explain

18:18.565 --> 18:21.198
and then I'd be knee-deep
in feelings.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.466
Well, what did you mean
by "family"?

just don't look at me, okay?

18:40.715 --> 18:42.648
Look at the floor.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.821
I've been thinking a lot about
going to college next year

18:50.823 --> 18:54.491
and all the things
that I'm gonna miss --

18:54.493 --> 18:59.028
Dad's joking
and his serious talks,

18:59.030 --> 19:01.063
Mom's terrible puns

19:01.065 --> 19:03.031
and how she never stops
thinking about us.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.732
-Oh, honey.
-Mom.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.633
Sorry, sorry.

19:08.269 --> 19:11.370
[ Voice breaking ]
I'm gonna miss my sisters

19:11.372 --> 19:13.372
and how we fight

19:13.374 --> 19:17.175
and how I know they'd fight
anyone twice as hard for me.

19:17.177 --> 19:19.277
I grew up in this
really terrific, safe place

19:19.279 --> 19:20.945
where it didn't matter
how I behaved.

19:20.947 --> 19:23.847
I was still loved.

19:23.849 --> 19:26.049
And I'm grateful
that when I leave,

19:26.051 --> 19:29.619
I'm gonna miss you all and your
goofy traditions so, so much

19:29.621 --> 19:32.254
because
that pain of missing you

19:32.256 --> 19:36.190
is just proof it was perfect
in so many ways.

19:36.192 --> 19:38.692
Can I look up now?

19:38.694 --> 19:41.695
Because I want to hug you,
and I don't want to miss.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.301
So...
We are good parents.

19:53.773 --> 19:57.040
At this point,
I'll take two out of three.

19:57.042 --> 19:58.574
I can't take it.
I lied.

19:58.576 --> 20:01.877
Kyle and I didn't spend
Thanksgiving with his grandma.

20:01.879 --> 20:05.780
See, honey?
You're right. She lied.

20:08.317 --> 20:11.117
Oh, Mandy,
I'm so proud of you.

20:11.119 --> 20:14.053
We were right.

20:21.328 --> 20:24.228
-Hey, there.
-Hey.

20:24.230 --> 20:27.064
It's technically still
Thanksgiving until 12:00,

20:27.066 --> 20:29.733
so I can stuff my face
till then.

20:29.735 --> 20:31.568
Mmm.
Yeah.

20:31.570 --> 20:34.637
And since it still
is technically Thanksgiving,

20:34.639 --> 20:38.774
it's a perfect time
to do the Gratitude List.

20:38.776 --> 20:41.676
Great.

20:41.678 --> 20:44.445
I'm eating pie, so you --
you start.

20:44.447 --> 20:46.814
Okay, all right,
well, uh...

20:46.816 --> 20:52.118
I am grateful for hot tea
on cold mornings,

20:52.120 --> 20:55.121
sunrise and sunset,

20:55.123 --> 20:57.423
the sound
of children's laughter.

20:57.425 --> 20:59.992
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:59.994 --> 21:04.996
I am especially thankful
for my incredible partner --

21:04.998 --> 21:07.264
yes --
who has helped me raise

21:07.266 --> 21:10.700
three amazing,
caring children.

21:10.702 --> 21:14.703
We've done a fabulous job,
and there is no one

21:14.705 --> 21:18.039
I would rather
spend my life with than you.

21:24.513 --> 21:26.446
Ditto.
