WEBVTT

00:06.272 --> 00:09.108
Okay, break time's over.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.278
Disengage autopilot.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.015
(horn honking)

00:16.017 --> 00:18.751
Whoo-hoo! Skip Day!
Cutting school!

00:18.753 --> 00:20.786
I'm homeschooled.
This is a normal d.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.087
(tires squealing)

00:24.257 --> 00:27.026
You hear that, Cleveland?
It's Skip Day.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.927
Remember Skip Day?

00:28.929 --> 00:33.165
ALL (chanting):
Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry.

00:35.101 --> 00:38.637
Wow, Terry, you're really good
at deep-throating stuff.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.507
No wonder you're so popular
with the ladies.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.008
BOY:
Cleveland, you're up.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.477
ALL (chanting):
Belly flop, belly flop,

00:45.479 --> 00:48.180
belly flop,
belly flop.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.349
(Tarzan yell)

00:55.922 --> 00:59.258
Piranhas!

00:59.260 --> 01:01.093
(loud snapping)
(yelling)

01:01.095 --> 01:02.494
(all yelling)

01:02.496 --> 01:04.263
Oh, no!

01:04.265 --> 01:05.931
Skip Day!

01:05.933 --> 01:08.033
BOY:
Cleveland... all right!

(sighs)

01:47.975 --> 01:51.110
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome a man

01:51.112 --> 01:53.779
for whom an introduction
is always necessary,

01:53.781 --> 01:54.980
Principal Wally Farquhar.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.149
Thank you, subordinate.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.951
And welcome parents.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.920
I've called you all here today
to witness the public scolding

02:01.922 --> 02:04.323
of each student
who skipped school yesterday.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.358
They're all awful,
awful children.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.293
Shame on you.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.496
Shame on you, shame on you,
shame on you,

02:10.498 --> 02:13.165
shame on you,
Good for you,
good for you,

02:13.167 --> 02:14.766
shame on you...
good for you.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.035
and shame on you.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.438
There is one student
who will avoid

02:19.440 --> 02:21.406
the wrath of the finger
of shame.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.711
Oh, God.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.213
The only student
in a quarter century

02:28.215 --> 02:30.849
to attend school
on Skip Day--

02:30.851 --> 02:32.951
Cleveland Brown Jr.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.153
(crowd booing)

02:34.155 --> 02:35.988
Loser!
You suck!

02:35.990 --> 02:39.791
Why didn't you tell me Junior
went to school yesterday?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.994
I wasn't here.
It was Skip Day.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.696
Cleveland Brown Jr.
will receive an award

02:44.698 --> 02:48.834
named after the last student
to attend school on Skip Day--

02:48.836 --> 02:52.337
the Wallace Farquhar Award
of Attendance Excellence,

02:52.339 --> 02:55.307
known internationally
as The Farky.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.809
ANNOUNCER: This is Cleveland
Brown Jr.'s first nomination

02:57.811 --> 03:00.012
and first win for his role

03:00.014 --> 03:01.480
as Brown-Nosing Tool

03:01.482 --> 03:04.283
in <i>Brown-Nosing Tool</i>
<i>Goes to School on Skip Day.</i>

03:04.285 --> 03:06.118
(booing)
I want to thank my daddy,

03:06.120 --> 03:08.020
all the teachers

03:08.022 --> 03:09.655
and my alarm clock.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.957
You can go to bed now,
Larry.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.194
Wow.
Get off the stage!

03:15.196 --> 03:17.429
Let's go, let's go, let's go
let's go.
(chicken clucking)

03:17.431 --> 03:20.866
Look, Junior, you know I
think you're a great kid.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.634
Thank you...
Quiet.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.703
But if you want other
people to respect you

03:24.705 --> 03:26.939
you can't always blindly
follow the rules.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.807
But rules are our friends.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.442
Well, if you want
any real friends,

03:30.444 --> 03:33.145
you better start standing
up to authority,

03:33.147 --> 03:36.114
or you'll end up lamer
than Ben Stiller's career.

03:36.116 --> 03:39.651
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This Christmas the Fockers</i>
<i>are on the move.</i>

03:39.653 --> 03:41.520
Sorry, but the
job's in Montana.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.089
Then Montana,
here I come.

03:44.091 --> 03:48.927
<i>Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro</i>
<i>in</i> Butte Fockers.

03:48.929 --> 03:52.831
(dejected sigh)
<i>That's right,</i> Butte Fockers.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.100
<i>As long as you keep</i>
<i>paying to watch,</i>

03:55.102 --> 03:56.702
<i>we'll keep farting them out.</i>

04:01.774 --> 04:04.109
Vroom, vroom.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.345
(tires squealing)

04:14.087 --> 04:15.821
Rallo's got a need for speed,

04:15.823 --> 04:19.258
and Rallo lives his life
one quarter mile at a time.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.094
And roads? Where Rallo's going,
he don't need...

04:22.096 --> 04:23.762
(both yelling)

04:25.298 --> 04:27.266
(groans)

04:29.135 --> 04:31.136
Oh, man, this is bad!

04:31.138 --> 04:33.872
Oh, look what God made me do.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.274
(growling)

04:35.276 --> 04:37.009
All part of his plan.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.710
(Kendra whimpers)

04:38.712 --> 04:40.379
(whimpering)

04:51.357 --> 04:55.661
Junior, I don't ever want to see
you laughed at like that again.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.796
(laughing)
Walk much?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.131
So anyway, from
this moment on,

04:59.133 --> 05:02.601
I don't want you to follow
anybody else's rules.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.470
I want you to be
a renegade.
Okay.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.839
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.542
Don't say okay
to everything.
Sorry.

05:10.544 --> 05:14.012
And don't say sorry
all the time.
Okay.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.648
No! Oh, forget it.
Just go to bed.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.583
Okay. Sorry.
(groans)

05:18.585 --> 05:20.952
Dang it, Junior,
it's only 6:30.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.421
I thought it seemed early.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.122
Then why were you going to bed?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.824
'Cause you told me to, Daddy.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.959
That's exactly why
you shouldn't.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.494
Here, chug this beer.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.962
I'm not 21.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.631
Plus, I'm on allergy
medication

05:32.633 --> 05:34.700
that shouldn't be mixed
with alcohol.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.601
But if you say so.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.537
(noisy gulping)

05:39.472 --> 05:40.872
(steady electronic tone)

05:40.874 --> 05:44.142
I'm sorry, we did all we could.
He's dead.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.445
(sobbing)

05:46.447 --> 05:49.681
Junior, please don't leave me!

05:49.683 --> 05:52.117
Okay.
Aw, you're hopeless!

05:52.119 --> 05:55.987
(Kendra whimpering)

05:57.924 --> 06:00.492
It was just a silly
little mistake, Rallo.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.461
Everyone makes mistakes.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.862
Even God.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.831
I mean, black people
with freckles?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.032
What's up with that?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.134
(chuckles)
(whimpering continues)

06:09.136 --> 06:10.836
(car approaching)

06:10.838 --> 06:12.504
(car door opening and closing)

06:12.506 --> 06:15.941
LESTER:
Oh, cool, a meteor fell
in front of our house.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.876
Oh, my God,
it's Kendra!

06:17.878 --> 06:19.511
Help! We need help!

06:19.513 --> 06:21.780
(siren wailing)

06:21.782 --> 06:24.082
(tires squealing)

06:24.084 --> 06:25.784
MAN:
She can't fit
in the ambulance.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.085
Get the crane.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.354
(vehicle back-up warning beeps)

06:29.356 --> 06:31.356
(Kendra whimpering)

06:34.160 --> 06:37.996
I've seen a horsefly,
and I've seen a dragonfly,

06:37.998 --> 06:40.766
but I never thought
I'd see an elephant fly.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.267
ANNOUNCER:
<i>We'll return</i>

06:42.269 --> 06:45.103
to The Wonderfully Racist
World of Disney after this.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.841
(electronic tones)

06:49.843 --> 06:52.210
Sure thing, colorful
singing robot toy.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.279
Anything you say.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.348
Boop-beep-bap-boo-beep-beep.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.083
Junior,
what are you doing?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.852
Obeying the musical commands
of my robotic overlord.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.155
See, this is the problem,
Junior.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.857
You're always following
the rules.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.492
You've got to stand up
to authority.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.693
Larry!

07:08.695 --> 07:10.295
Larry's going away--

07:10.297 --> 07:12.998
unless you stand up to me
and take him back.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.133
Put him down, Daddy.
He doesn't know your scent.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.469
Does he know this scent?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.704
No! He's my friend!

07:19.706 --> 07:21.139
Fight me!

07:21.141 --> 07:22.774
I'm not gonna fight you.
Come on!

07:22.776 --> 07:23.975
Stop it, Daddy!

07:23.977 --> 07:24.943
He has a family!

07:24.945 --> 07:25.944
(growls)

07:25.946 --> 07:28.313
Damn it, I said stop it!

07:28.315 --> 07:31.183
(grunts, glass breaking, ding)

07:32.118 --> 07:35.921
Daddy, I'm stronger than you.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.989
Well, one lucky punch
does not...

07:37.991 --> 07:39.191
(both grunting)

07:39.193 --> 07:40.459
(yells)

07:40.461 --> 07:42.360
(sighs)

07:45.631 --> 07:47.699
You're a dead man.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.209
So, son...

07:57.211 --> 07:58.643
(clearing his throat)

07:58.645 --> 08:01.780
...hell of a sucker punch
you got in there the other day.

08:01.782 --> 08:05.183
You told him to stand up to
you, and then he beat your ass.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.752
What'd you say, Junior?!

08:07.754 --> 08:09.488
You think
you're a tough guy now?

08:09.490 --> 08:11.089
No.
That's it!

08:11.091 --> 08:12.757
Let's see you try to hit me

08:12.759 --> 08:13.925
when I've got my dukes up.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.261
Boom!
Get yo money!
Get yo money!

08:16.263 --> 08:17.596
(groaning)

08:17.598 --> 08:20.098
Oh, sure, it's real easy
to sucker punch a man

08:20.100 --> 08:21.633
when he has his fists up.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.502
But I'd like to see you try it

08:23.504 --> 08:25.971
when he gets on a table,
grabs a frying pan,

08:25.973 --> 08:28.440
distracts you by saying there's
something out the window,

08:28.442 --> 08:31.142
and then, when your back
is turned, knocks you out cold.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.311
Please don't.
(growling)

08:33.313 --> 08:35.146
(sighs)

08:35.148 --> 08:36.648
Junior, look outside!

08:36.650 --> 08:37.916
There's a double rainbow!

08:37.918 --> 08:39.184
What does it mean?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.519
(yelling)

08:40.521 --> 08:42.187
Whoa!
(glass breaking,
tin clinking)

08:42.189 --> 08:43.788
My mustache!

08:43.790 --> 08:46.057
I can't feel
my mustache!

08:48.861 --> 08:51.696
(gun chamber cocking)

08:53.466 --> 08:56.635
Oh, my goodness, what has
happened to Miss Kendra?

08:56.637 --> 08:59.137
I ask this question
because I have been away

08:59.139 --> 09:03.041
at rehabilitation
for quote, unquote, exhaustion.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.943
Someone crashed into Kendra.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.144
(whimpering)

09:06.146 --> 09:08.947
Leave... the scab... alone!

09:08.949 --> 09:11.082
Here. Have some cheese diddles.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.084
(muffled munching)

09:13.086 --> 09:16.121
Hit-and-run, but Kendra got
a good look at the bastard

09:16.123 --> 09:17.489
before he got away,

09:17.491 --> 09:19.157
and she sketched out
a little drawing.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.126
Look familiar?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.661
No.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.030
This white, Chinese,
or Latino woman

09:25.032 --> 09:27.666
does not look familiar
to me at all.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.635
Well, when I find
whoever did this...

09:30.637 --> 09:33.872
I'm gonna avenge
my fat, disgusting wife.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.640
Oh, Lester.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.008
(belches)

09:37.010 --> 09:38.143
(sighs)

09:38.145 --> 09:41.279
Pew! Watch out
for that one.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.815
(crickets chirping)

09:43.817 --> 09:46.618
Got to get rid of the evidence.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.454
(imitates engine starting)

09:49.456 --> 09:52.157
(quietly):
Vroom. Vroom.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.500
(snake rattling)

10:25.491 --> 10:28.360
Well, my oldest friend,
you deserve better,

10:28.362 --> 10:30.662
but we don't always get
what we deserve.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.030
See you!

10:32.032 --> 10:34.866
(wind whistling)

10:39.305 --> 10:41.373
RALLO:
Aah, son of a bitch!

10:41.375 --> 10:43.842
(liquid gurgling, hissing)

10:51.817 --> 10:53.618
LESTER:
Now, from the bruising here,

10:53.620 --> 10:56.454
it seems his boy caught him
in the nose, in the cheek,

10:56.456 --> 10:58.857
and basically removed
everything down here.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.492
(laughter)

11:00.494 --> 11:02.360
Come on, Cleveland,
snap out of it.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.795
Zing us back.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.997
Yeah, come
on, rib us for
your pleasure.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.533
We're all
gonna die.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.635
(laughs)
There he is!

11:10.637 --> 11:12.037
No, Tim.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.540
Like <i>Lopez Tonight,</i> there's
nothing funny about this.

11:15.542 --> 11:19.878
After I got beat up by my son,
then got beat up again,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.880
I had an epi-piphany.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.582
With each year,
Junior gets stronger

11:24.584 --> 11:26.451
and I just get weaker.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.853
My best years are behind me.

11:28.855 --> 11:29.988
I'm old.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.523
We're all old.

11:32.491 --> 11:35.160
I'm four.

11:37.496 --> 11:41.199
As I have but little time
left on this earth,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.935
I hereby make
the following bequeathments.

11:43.937 --> 11:48.306
To Rallo, I leave my library
of vintage nudie mags,

11:48.308 --> 11:52.010
which he may not look at
until he is nine years old.

11:52.012 --> 11:56.481
To Roberta,
I leave 365 yellow shirts.

11:56.483 --> 12:01.119
And to my son, Cleveland
Rog Rerun Dwayne Brown Jr.,

12:01.121 --> 12:03.021
I will surely leave nothing.

12:03.023 --> 12:07.659
For he hath already
taken everything from me.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.027
Amen.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.695
Cleveland, what the
hell are you doing?

12:10.697 --> 12:11.763
Dying.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.265
So, I finished my will.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.434
The good news is
you'll be taken care of

12:16.436 --> 12:18.036
for six to eight weeks.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.105
You're not planning to eat out,
are you?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.973
You know I like
my Boston Market.

12:21.975 --> 12:22.974
Two weeks.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.509
You're not dying,
Cleveland.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.778
You just need a
little cheering up.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.681
How about you splash
around in the Tubbs?

12:29.683 --> 12:31.282
Good idea.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.918
A warm bath
with some Epsom salts

12:33.920 --> 12:37.522
is just what these
tired old bones need.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.160
(farting)

12:42.162 --> 12:43.962
Old.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.930
Don't have to
acknowledge them.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.701
(farting)

12:49.703 --> 12:52.036
I may just leave that man.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.104
CLEVELAND JR.:
Okay, that's great.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.272
Good job.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.207
Now, let's try
something a little wild.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.042
Loosen up a
little bit.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.011
I'm so cold.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.147
Did I take my pill?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.748
Where's my cardigan?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.083
Daddy?
Get back!

13:05.085 --> 13:07.018
I'm not carrying
any money!

13:07.020 --> 13:08.453
Dad, I'm worried about you.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.455
What do you say
we go to the movies?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.689
Leave the house?

13:11.691 --> 13:13.691
Everyone will
point and laugh

13:13.693 --> 13:18.129
at the weak old man who
got beat up by his son.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.666
Oh, Larry, I've got
to help my dad.

13:21.668 --> 13:25.103
You know, that guy with the
mustache who just walked by.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.137
(laughs)

13:26.139 --> 13:27.939
Well, who did you
think that was?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.543
What the hell would Danny
Glover be doing in our house?!

13:31.545 --> 13:33.511
Shooting a
movie, he says.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.712
Hey, kids.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.181
Any luck finding your perp?

13:36.183 --> 13:38.750
Nope. But I'm
seriously considering

13:38.752 --> 13:41.586
expanding our efforts beyond
standing here on the porch.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.087
HOLT:
♪ I'm gonna ride

13:43.089 --> 13:44.589
♪ Ride like the wind

13:44.591 --> 13:47.125
♪ To be free again

13:47.127 --> 13:49.694
♪ And I've got
such a long way to go ♪

13:49.696 --> 13:55.066
♪ Such a long way to go.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.676
Baby, I found him.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.678
Holt's a dead man.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.679
(pumps shotgun)

14:07.681 --> 14:09.013
(gulps)

14:09.015 --> 14:11.115
You know, I think I
like cocking this thing

14:11.117 --> 14:13.184
more than I like
shooting it.

14:18.424 --> 14:21.192
Who are any of these people?

14:22.428 --> 14:24.095
Junior! My God!

14:24.097 --> 14:25.330
What happened
to you?!

14:25.332 --> 14:28.766
Maybe I was beat up,
maybe it's Maybelline.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.301
Sweet illusions
and fake contusions!

14:30.303 --> 14:31.502
But why?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.804
For Daddy.

14:32.806 --> 14:35.039
I told everyone at school
and everyone in town

14:35.041 --> 14:36.841
that my daddy beat me up.

14:36.843 --> 14:37.942
Broke an arm, too.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.277
Wink-wink.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.179
So now he can
hold his head up high

14:41.181 --> 14:43.982
as the guy who's still strong
enough to beat up his own son.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.284
Oh, Junior, what
have you done?

14:46.286 --> 14:49.087
Donna, we need a phone
with large buttons.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.121
(knock on door)

14:50.123 --> 14:52.357
Must be that mischievous
neighbor boy.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.092
I'll get it.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.128
(humming)

14:57.130 --> 14:58.429
Cleveland Brown?

14:58.431 --> 14:59.764
In my youth.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.966
We got a report
that you beat up your son.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.701
Yep! He kicked
my ass!

15:03.703 --> 15:05.970
Say what, son?

15:05.972 --> 15:08.039
You're under arrest
for child abuse.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.676
The hell I am!

15:11.678 --> 15:14.145
(grunting)

15:14.147 --> 15:15.980
(electrical buzzing)

15:15.982 --> 15:19.017
(grunting)

15:20.653 --> 15:22.720
(growling)

15:24.189 --> 15:25.857
Wait a minute,
that's my Maybelline?

15:25.859 --> 15:28.159
Don't you ever go in
my makeup box again!

15:28.928 --> 15:31.262
Uh, bye, Cleveland.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.170
That was Len Stein.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.105
They're holding your father
through the weekend.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.808
Do Jews ever have good news?

15:43.810 --> 15:45.043
Oh, this is a nightmare.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.211
I can't believe
Daddy's in jail.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.546
What was I thinking?!

15:48.548 --> 15:49.681
I don't know.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.316
But now you're the man
of the house.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.017
Now, your father had
a lot of chores,

15:53.019 --> 15:54.686
and you're gonna
have to take care of them.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.822
First up, I need you to
relocate the pet cemetery

15:57.824 --> 16:01.125
from one corner of the
backyard to the other.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.028
Oh, Daddy,
you don't belong in jail.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.864
I should be the only man
kissing you good night.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.668
And I will be.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.642
Holt, you have to
listen to me.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.977
Can't. Got
to bounce.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.212
Mom's taking a nap.
Free time.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.947
Wait, Holt!

16:22.949 --> 16:24.015
You're in terrible trouble!

16:24.017 --> 16:26.250
Oh, man.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.989
Enjoy the ride!

16:30.991 --> 16:33.791
(laughs maniacally)

16:33.793 --> 16:36.494
I sure hope he don't
<i>break</i> nothing.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.930
(laughs maniacally)

16:38.932 --> 16:40.098
You cut his brakes?!

16:40.100 --> 16:41.099
(groans)

16:41.101 --> 16:43.034
Look, Mr. and Mrs. Krinklesac,

16:43.036 --> 16:45.470
there's something
I need to tell you.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.939
You know how the Bible's
all about forgiveness?

16:47.941 --> 16:49.140
And vengeance.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.942
And loving thy neighbor.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.977
And killing sodomites!

16:52.979 --> 16:54.479
Let me start over.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.514
You ever read
<i>The Berenstain Bears</i>

16:56.516 --> 16:58.850
<i>Forgive a Hit-and-Run Driver?</i>

17:00.619 --> 17:02.520
I'm sorry I lied to you.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.256
You know, Rallo,
it takes a lot of guts

17:05.258 --> 17:07.358
to admit to something
way after the fact

17:07.360 --> 17:10.261
and when you've put
another man's life in danger.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.163
Let's go save Holt!

17:14.099 --> 17:15.166
(chuckles)

17:18.504 --> 17:21.105
But I'm telling you,
I wanted him to beat me up!

17:21.107 --> 17:22.840
This is all my fault!

17:22.842 --> 17:25.643
Son, all victims of abuse
feel like it's their fault.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.012
And I'll say to you
what I say to them.

17:28.014 --> 17:31.115
That's what you get for standing
near Arnold Schwarzenegger.

17:31.117 --> 17:31.983
(laughs)

17:31.985 --> 17:33.051
Oh.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.286
Daddy! Daddy!

17:35.288 --> 17:36.988
Whoa there, son,
you're safe now.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.323
Just cooperate with us
and we'll see to it

17:39.325 --> 17:42.293
that your father is locked
up for a very long time.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.494
(echoing):
<i>A very long time.</i>

17:43.496 --> 17:46.364
<i>A very long time.</i>

17:46.366 --> 17:48.599
(slowing, distorted):
<i>A very long time.</i>

17:48.601 --> 17:53.704
<i>Very... long... time.</i>

17:53.706 --> 17:55.807
(Cleveland Jr. grunting)

17:55.809 --> 17:57.442
I can't live like this!

17:57.444 --> 17:58.776
I need my daddy!

17:58.778 --> 18:00.111
(gasps)

18:00.113 --> 18:00.878
Uh-oh.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.613
Give me my daddy!

18:07.352 --> 18:08.920
Junior, I don't think
we should...

18:08.922 --> 18:10.521
Shut the hell up
and drive!

18:10.523 --> 18:12.156
Yes, sir.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.691
(tires screeching)

18:13.693 --> 18:15.760
(sirens wailing)

18:27.606 --> 18:28.940
I hear him!

18:28.942 --> 18:29.974
There he is!

18:29.976 --> 18:31.976
(horn honks)

18:31.978 --> 18:33.344
Holt, stop!

18:35.013 --> 18:36.080
(tires screeching)

18:38.417 --> 18:40.084
Airing it out!

18:42.287 --> 18:44.155
(sirens wailing)

18:47.126 --> 18:48.359
(rings bell)

18:48.361 --> 18:50.761
(screaming)

18:51.330 --> 18:52.964
Faster! Faster!

18:52.966 --> 18:54.265
No way, Junior.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.634
If a police car gets
a speeding ticket,

18:56.636 --> 19:00.371
we could open up a paradox
that could destroy us all.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.040
(screaming)

19:03.042 --> 19:04.775
'Sup?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.544
(screaming)

19:06.546 --> 19:08.980
I got a idea.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.414
Step on it!

19:11.116 --> 19:12.250
(tires screeching)

19:14.086 --> 19:15.386
Now!

19:16.922 --> 19:18.489
(Holt screams)

19:18.491 --> 19:21.792
(sirens wailing)

19:21.794 --> 19:25.296
(panting)

19:25.298 --> 19:28.499
And I thought... these things...

19:28.501 --> 19:31.969
smelled bad... on the outside.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.771
Baby? Kendra?

19:33.773 --> 19:35.006
Say something.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.942
(chewing noisily)

19:37.944 --> 19:39.210
Sorry.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.811
Don't be
sorry, honey.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.647
Enjoy your scab.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.248
You deserve it.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.584
(chewing noisily)

19:46.586 --> 19:48.019
(sirens wailing)

19:51.757 --> 19:52.957
Go, Junior, go!

19:52.959 --> 19:53.958
You're awesome!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.059
We think
you're cool now!

20:01.533 --> 20:03.267
Junior, look at you.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.470
Brandishing a stolen gun,
jacking a police car,

20:06.472 --> 20:09.607
and leading the entire force
on a high-speed chase.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.009
You're standing up to authority.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.111
You're right! I am!

20:14.113 --> 20:16.747
Course, I'm still the guy
who's weaker than his son.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.015
No, you're not.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.285
You're the guy who beat up
his son and went to jail for it.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.954
I won't tell anyone.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.455
(both laugh)

20:24.457 --> 20:27.258
All this time, I thought
I was teaching you.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.093
But it was you
who was...

20:29.095 --> 20:30.761
Teaching?
(gasps)

20:31.964 --> 20:32.964
School!

20:32.966 --> 20:34.999
I've never missed school!

20:35.001 --> 20:36.334
(tires screeching)

20:36.336 --> 20:38.369
(sirens wailing)

20:42.441 --> 20:44.242
(school bell ringing)

20:47.846 --> 20:50.514
I think we can all agree
that anyone would have

20:50.516 --> 20:52.350
ended up in
the same situation

20:52.352 --> 20:55.419
if their son had gone
to school on Skip Day.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.988
So, what do you say?

20:56.990 --> 20:58.923
Friends?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.157
