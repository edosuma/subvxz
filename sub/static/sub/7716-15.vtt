00:01.086 --> 00:03.254
Today is the first day
of Sabre's new project

00:03.380 --> 00:05.507
to develop a chain
of retail stores.

00:05.590 --> 00:09.386
I am meeting my new boss, Nellie
Bertram, Head of Special Projects.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.638
Work starts at 9:00.

00:11.888 --> 00:15.350
Sabre HQ is 30 minutes away
driving the speed limit,

00:15.433 --> 00:17.686
giving everyone 20
minutes to shower,

00:17.811 --> 00:20.063
plus 50 for Jim
to style his hair,

00:20.146 --> 00:24.401
20 for breakfast, 40 for Erin to get
lost between her room and the lobby,

00:24.484 --> 00:27.112
90 for Ryan to do
his morning ecstasy.

00:28.238 --> 00:30.115
We're already 20 minutes late.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.957
Wake up!

00:42.210 --> 00:44.838
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, wake up! Ow!

00:45.964 --> 00:47.465
Why are you sleeping
that way?

00:47.549 --> 00:50.844
Oh. I was reading the mattress
tag and I fell asleep.

00:51.302 --> 00:55.390
Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up!
The hotel's on fire!

00:55.473 --> 00:57.976
Stanley, wake up!
It's pretzel day!

01:07.193 --> 01:08.194
Good morning.

01:08.278 --> 01:12.157
Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun.
We're in Florida now.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.617
Hey, you. I'm so
glad this is happening.

01:14.743 --> 01:17.120
I actually came to your
door twice last night.

01:17.203 --> 01:19.330
Come on in,
the water's fine.

01:19.581 --> 01:21.040
Oh, not cool!

01:21.583 --> 01:26.087
I am on the two-kids sleep schedule,
so I'm up and at 'em at 4:15.

01:26.171 --> 01:29.799
But no kids, so I honestly didn't
know what to do with myself.

01:30.467 --> 01:32.302
And then I thought
of something. Uh...

01:33.344 --> 01:36.264
Here is Dwight...
What the...

01:38.683 --> 01:40.018
Oh, man.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.478
What do you think happened?

01:42.353 --> 01:44.814
Looks like Jim got mixed up
with some bad apples.

01:45.857 --> 01:48.568
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It wasn't me.

01:49.861 --> 01:52.530
I got to find "Luwanda
at the Alcohol Club."

02:18.056 --> 02:19.682
Puppet
Cool. For your kids?

02:19.766 --> 02:22.519
Yeah. It's weird being away from them.
I've never done this before.

02:22.977 --> 02:26.689
Attention, Dunder Mifflin
group, proceed outside.

02:27.065 --> 02:29.859
The vehicle is waiting.
Seats have been assigned.

02:29.943 --> 02:31.486
Shotgun goes to Ryan.

02:31.569 --> 02:33.613
Congratulations, Ryan.

02:36.074 --> 02:38.201
I need to make Nellie
see me as a leader today.

02:38.368 --> 02:40.745
First impressions
get locked in forever.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.914
When I first met Pam,
she said something

02:43.039 --> 02:44.833
that slightly
rubbed me the wrong way.

02:44.916 --> 02:47.126
Since then I've
loved working with Pam,

02:47.210 --> 02:48.878
and she's frankly wonderful,

02:48.962 --> 02:50.171
but I hate her.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.590
I'll have
a bottle of the antacid.

02:53.091 --> 02:54.843
Also I want to get
a souvenir for my son,

02:54.926 --> 02:56.553
but his mother doesn't
acknowledge my paternity.

02:56.636 --> 02:57.804
Do you have anything for that?

02:57.887 --> 02:59.764
Also I want it to
have a Florida feel.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.391
What does he like?

03:01.850 --> 03:03.142
Power.

03:03.601 --> 03:07.981
Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't
see too many museums around here."

03:08.064 --> 03:10.400
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough.
Get in the car.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.026
Hey, are you okay?

03:12.110 --> 03:14.445
I'm fine, okay?
I'm just stressed

03:14.529 --> 03:16.698
because I care
about this project.

03:16.781 --> 03:18.199
And frankly,
the fact that none of you

03:18.324 --> 03:19.742
are vomiting or
diarrheal right now,

03:19.826 --> 03:20.910
I find very alarming.

03:20.994 --> 03:23.037
Who says none of
us are diarrheal?

03:25.373 --> 03:27.834
Are you sure it's stress?
Because I did poison you.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.294
Very funny, Jim.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.087
Oh, no, I'm serious.
I was thinking for this trip,

03:31.170 --> 03:33.006
I have to do something epic,
so what should that be?

03:33.089 --> 03:35.008
And then I thought of it.
I'll poison you.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.260
What are you going to do? Are you
going to steal my newspaper,

03:37.343 --> 03:38.761
or put a cricket in my cereal,
or something?

03:39.137 --> 03:41.431
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
That's a good one.

03:44.976 --> 03:46.686
Whoa. Stanley,
did you just come back

03:46.769 --> 03:47.979
from burning down
a rival night club?

03:48.062 --> 03:49.105
Laugh it up, Halpert.

03:49.188 --> 03:53.026
I'm in Florida for a month without
my family, I'm going to enjoy this.

03:53.568 --> 03:56.154
Want to get in?
You can work the iPod.

03:56.863 --> 03:58.156
Yes.

03:58.865 --> 04:01.993
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you
have no idea how to vacation.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.161
Find some Kenny Loggins.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.370
Loggins and Messina.

04:04.454 --> 04:06.247
Did I say Messina?

04:09.918 --> 04:13.212
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
It's so quiet.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.756
I like it.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.550
It's so peaceful, I've already
written 12 plays today.

04:18.092 --> 04:22.847
It's so quiet, one might say
you could hear a pin...

04:25.516 --> 04:27.018
I thought that
would be cooler.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.436
I loved it.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.854
Hey, can you pick up
the pin?

04:29.938 --> 04:31.439
Some of us like to
work in our bare feet.

04:31.522 --> 04:36.361
Of course. I will pick up the pin.
It is right here.

04:38.363 --> 04:40.114
Got it. Can we see that?
Did you really find it?

04:40.198 --> 04:43.368
Yes. Right here.
Got it. Dink. Ow.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.872
In the trash.
Hey, why is it so quiet?

04:47.956 --> 04:49.707
Shouldn't
the phone be ringing?

04:50.750 --> 04:51.793
Uh-oh.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.878
Erin set
the phone to voice-mail.

04:53.962 --> 04:55.672
Great.
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

04:56.005 --> 04:58.466
There.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.760
Oh, there we go. Pam?

05:00.843 --> 05:02.178
Yeah.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.638
Can you get the phone?

05:03.721 --> 05:05.056
Well, I'm not
the receptionist.

05:05.181 --> 05:06.474
Well, you used to be.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.812
I know, but I can't cover reception.
I have a ton of work to do.

05:10.937 --> 05:12.730
Phone's ringing.

05:14.065 --> 05:17.735
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out!
I know it's for me.

05:22.949 --> 05:25.827
Are you guys kidding me? Stop
flirting and someone get the phone!

05:25.910 --> 05:27.203
Answer the phone!

05:27.286 --> 05:28.538
Pick up the phone!

05:28.663 --> 05:29.872
Andy, you're standing up!

05:29.956 --> 05:31.082
You're the closest one to it.

05:31.207 --> 05:32.291
Fine.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.627
Hello. Dunder Mifflin.

05:34.919 --> 05:37.255
Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin.
How may I be of service?

05:39.007 --> 05:40.633
How was the drive?
Fantastic.

05:40.717 --> 05:41.843
Stanley drives so fast.

05:41.926 --> 05:46.014
Life is short. Drive fast, leave a sexy corpse.
That's one of my mottos.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.350
I would love to
hear the other mottos.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.644
Quick query, Halpert.

05:51.769 --> 05:52.812
No way.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.188
Still queer?

05:54.897 --> 05:55.940
Packer

05:56.024 --> 05:58.776
You can't put me down.
Too strong.

06:00.445 --> 06:03.281
Yeah, Dwight and Jim
tried to get me fired.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.825
But I landed on my
feet down here in Florida.

06:05.950 --> 06:09.120
You see, this cat's got nine
lives and a nine-inch...

06:09.704 --> 06:13.624
Say, "So who's
leading this thing anyway?"

06:14.751 --> 06:16.836
So who's leading
this thing anyway?

06:19.088 --> 06:22.091
Psst. Say,
"I can't wait to meet him."

06:22.633 --> 06:24.260
I can't wait to meet him.

06:24.343 --> 06:29.724
"Him," you said? Don't think
a woman can be a leader?

06:31.017 --> 06:34.395
I...
You poor, simple boy.

06:34.479 --> 06:36.022
Expected a man, did you?

06:36.105 --> 06:42.028
Strong, powerful, huge whopping penis?
Well, sorry to disappoint.

06:42.111 --> 06:46.616
But my huge whopping penis is right
here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

06:47.533 --> 06:52.121
So stop looking at my breasts,
and start looking at my penis.

06:55.792 --> 06:59.253
I'm Nellie Bertram,
President of Special Projects.

06:59.629 --> 07:01.047
In the next few weeks
we're going to throw

07:01.172 --> 07:02.632
everything you
know about business

07:02.715 --> 07:05.218
out of the window
and do it our own way.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.637
Are your minds blown?

07:07.720 --> 07:11.140
So, how did this special
project come about anyway?

07:11.224 --> 07:17.522
Well, I interviewed to be
the manager of your branch.

07:17.897 --> 07:21.943
After you decided I
wasn't a good fit...

07:22.026 --> 07:23.528
It was...
Ah. Mmm-mmm.

07:24.028 --> 07:26.531
It was. I went
on a shopping spree.

07:26.656 --> 07:29.117
Very destructive,
I bought 13 pianos.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.829
Then I realized, what if
Sabre had a store? Hmm?

07:33.579 --> 07:37.416
So I called Jo, old friend,
founder of Sabre, and I told her,

07:37.500 --> 07:40.461
and she grabbed me by the
shoulders and she said, "Yes!"

07:40.878 --> 07:42.922
So let's talk about
this Sabre store then.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.967
Probably going to
look stupid, right?

07:46.050 --> 07:48.636
Like a big turd with a door
on the front, right?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.221
What do you think
it should look like?

07:50.346 --> 07:53.307
It might be fun if each store
had a different theme,

07:53.391 --> 07:55.768
like a beach one,
a winter one, a jungle one.

07:55.852 --> 07:57.687
No. Not a big fan of
the winter aesthetic.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.605
Well, that was just one idea.
It doesn't have to be winter.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.566
Oh, no, it does. It does.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.235
It has to be winter,
and I reject it.

08:04.861 --> 08:09.574
So I drew up a design concept,
probably going to be rubbish, right?

08:10.575 --> 08:13.161
Would you like to look at it?
Just so you can laugh at it.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.287
Yeah.

08:14.412 --> 08:15.496
Let me just get
the projector working.

08:16.998 --> 08:19.625
You got to stop with the antacids.
It's not the antidote.

08:20.251 --> 08:21.878
You didn't poison me.
It's just stress.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.254
Okay.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.630
What is the antidote?

08:24.714 --> 08:26.007
True love's kiss.

08:26.132 --> 08:27.466
Jim, help me
lower this screen.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.510
You're a big tall man.

08:29.594 --> 08:32.680
You'd be hilarious trying to
do it, like a little boy.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.640
Just let go of his balloon.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.018
I'll do it.

08:37.101 --> 08:40.521
I always say if you want something
done right, ask Dwight.

08:40.605 --> 08:41.606
Right, Dwight.

08:41.981 --> 08:44.108
Right, Dwight.
Right, Dwight. Right, Dwight.

08:44.192 --> 08:46.694
Sorry. Now you'll never be able
to get that out of your head.

08:49.864 --> 08:51.240
I can do it.

08:56.746 --> 08:57.872
There we go.

09:03.127 --> 09:06.005
Yes, a complete inability
to pass gas, pervert.

09:06.505 --> 09:10.426
Yeah, it's tender, but it can't be appendicitis.
I eat more than enough bacon.

09:10.801 --> 09:14.305
Okay, what poison mimics the
symptoms of appendicitis?

09:14.430 --> 09:15.640
You don't know. Hold on.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.190
What kind of
poison did you use?

09:24.857 --> 09:27.777
Dwight, I didn't poison you.
I was kidding.

09:31.072 --> 09:33.407
Yeah, I'm going to
need an ambulance.

09:34.325 --> 09:36.827
Hold on. I have the address
in my phone. Hold on.

09:38.162 --> 09:39.455
Sabre has assigned...
Hold on one second.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.082
...the following positions
in the retail division.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.333
Uh, quick question.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.878
Vice President, who is that?
There is no name listed.

09:45.962 --> 09:49.840
Is there not? Maybe I'm just
waiting for someone to wow me.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.972
Sir? Sir, where should
we send the ambulance?

09:56.389 --> 09:58.724
Send it to
the freaking moon, idiot.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.937
I'll tell you what, though,
since my move down to Florida,

10:03.020 --> 10:05.189
I've really gotten back
into hunting, big-time.

10:05.648 --> 10:09.235
- Hunting's so primal, almost sexual.
- Totally.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.945
Yeah, I mean,
I'd never bang an animal.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.071
You can hardly
tell the difference

10:12.196 --> 10:13.281
between a boy or a girl,
you know?

10:13.364 --> 10:14.782
But hunting's intense.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.284
You talking about hunting?

10:16.367 --> 10:17.910
I love hunting.
I'm a master hunter.

10:18.786 --> 10:19.996
Did you say "masturbator"?

10:20.079 --> 10:22.748
I'm a decent batter. My cousin,
Mose, that's a master batter.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.875
Why are you
sitting down like that?

10:25.376 --> 10:27.003
Why is everyone
else standing up?

10:27.086 --> 10:30.339
Okay, team, let's get back to work!
Break's over.

10:32.258 --> 10:34.260
Wow. Are you that bored?

10:34.760 --> 10:37.430
It's just rum.
I'm not bored. I'm a pirate.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.181
Is that another motto?

10:39.307 --> 10:40.850
It's whatever you want.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.226
Hmm.

10:42.435 --> 10:43.728
Or do you only
drink with your kids?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.229
No, let's do it.

10:45.354 --> 10:46.439
Woah. That's healthy.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.941
I've spent so much of
my life telling myself,

10:49.066 --> 10:51.235
"Please, don't
end up like Stanley."

10:52.903 --> 10:56.407
And now I'm wondering
if I even have what it takes.

10:57.283 --> 11:03.247
We have the Sabre pyramid, right?
We've got a bunch of humans.

11:03.414 --> 11:06.417
You guys. Humans, pyramid.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.919
Human pyramid. Do you follow?

11:09.003 --> 11:11.756
It's a team-building exercise.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.424
You love it. Who's in?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.344
Tallahassee, let's go.

11:16.427 --> 11:17.511
Jim, are you in?

11:17.595 --> 11:18.929
Oh, I don't know.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.389
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.267
All right.
What the heck? Let's do it.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.686
This is great.
This is going to be great.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.438
I feel like I'm
in ancient Egypt.

11:28.356 --> 11:30.733
I'll be on top. That's the
most important position.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.818
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.112
Dwight,
why don't we just hold off

11:35.237 --> 11:37.114
with the human
pyramids for a while?

11:37.198 --> 11:39.241
Everyone stop moving.
Everyone stop wiggling.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.534
I feel like I'm
going to vomit.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.745
Dude, don't you yak on me.
This shirt is Van Heusen.

11:42.828 --> 11:43.913
Oh, stop moving.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.957
No one's moving.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.338
Arrest Jim.
He poisoned me.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.216
What? No. No.
It was not a poisoning.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.343
The one thing Pam
made sure I knew,

11:57.468 --> 11:59.553
Florida's pretty loose
with the death penalty.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.472
You need an operation.
You have appendicitis.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.141
Oh! Who called it?
Nothing but net.

12:04.225 --> 12:05.476
How long will he be gone?

12:05.601 --> 12:06.852
Two or three days.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.063
Don't remember me like this.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.732
Remember me as the man
who pulled down the screen.

12:11.816 --> 12:12.900
Drama queen, am I right?

12:16.237 --> 12:18.656
Philip, if you're
hearing this memo,

12:18.823 --> 12:21.242
that can only mean
one thing, I am dead.

12:21.534 --> 12:26.247
You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms.
Please, you must do one thing.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.833
Kill Mose before he kills you.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.839
Mose. Hey, it's Dwight.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.507
Listen, yeah, I just want
to give you a heads up.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.967
That was
an interesting diversion.

12:38.092 --> 12:39.510
Should we get
back to the meeting?

12:40.594 --> 12:42.388
Woah. Are those mini pizzas?

12:42.513 --> 12:44.640
Yeah. I figure if
we keep things savory

12:44.765 --> 12:46.892
while Oscar's mouth
is in canker country...

12:46.976 --> 12:49.228
I also have some
bacon-wrapped dates on deck.

12:49.311 --> 12:53.399
Look at these little mini pizzas.
Does this make me look huge?

12:54.525 --> 12:57.611
Hey, guys,
look at me, I'm huge.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.990
Hey, Darryl, good news,
your fax went through.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.534
On  yeah.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.702
UP high.

13:04.869 --> 13:05.953
Yes, sir. Thanks.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.498
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put
out some new magazines. Check it out.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.083
Ah, Dwell.

13:15.004 --> 13:17.882
I'm acting like I like
Reception, and I'm a really good actor

13:17.965 --> 13:21.427
so people are actually buying
that I actually like Reception.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.388
But I mean,
seriously, Reception sucks.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.056
Ooh! There's the phone!

13:27.099 --> 13:28.559
I just
got out of surgery.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.936
What's going on? Fill me in.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.231
Well, we broke into groups and the
groups are giving presentations later.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.066
Who's doing the presentations?

13:36.567 --> 13:37.735
Packer's giving one.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.570
Jim will probably
give ours, I guess.

13:39.695 --> 13:40.696
Damn it!

13:41.322 --> 13:43.657
Let's see.
What else have you missed?

13:43.866 --> 13:46.035
Ryan switched his
nametag to his pants,

13:46.118 --> 13:47.578
so now it's like
if you wear yours

13:47.703 --> 13:49.121
on your shirt,
you're a total dip.

13:49.205 --> 13:51.290
But if you switch,
you're a copycat.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.542
But I think I
figured out a solution.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.421
What else? My shoes are...

13:58.005 --> 14:00.257
...features the tech support area.
Bring in your product,

14:00.341 --> 14:02.843
a bunch of nerdy
virgins fix it on the spot.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.261
Huge for building loyalty.

14:04.345 --> 14:06.096
Yes, that is
a very good point.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.806
Yeah, Todd, decent idea.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.893
Obvious, but interesting.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.561
Dwight, are you all right?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.146
I'm great. How are you?

14:18.776 --> 14:19.777
Uh...

14:21.946 --> 14:23.447
What's our presentation about?

14:23.531 --> 14:24.657
Dwight, will you go
back to the hospital?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.158
You were there for
like three hours.

14:26.242 --> 14:27.785
I got the surgery.
What else is there to do?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.787
Do 100 jumping jacks.
No. I don't feel like it.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.080
You do 100 jumping jacks.

14:31.163 --> 14:32.331
I don't feel like it either.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.959
...ninety-seven, 98, 99...

14:35.417 --> 14:36.710
I want the Vice Presidency.

14:36.794 --> 14:38.087
You haven't done
any of the research.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.881
You're too slow. You're too small.
Seabiscuit is a stupid name.

14:40.965 --> 14:42.633
You guys sound just like
the enemies of Seabiscuit.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.176
I'm going to do it.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.761
Oh, let him do it.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.972
Stanley,
are you listening to music?

14:48.138 --> 14:49.223
Yep.

14:50.307 --> 14:53.060
All right, who's ready
for the next presentation?

14:53.394 --> 14:55.312
Oh... What is your topic?

14:56.355 --> 14:59.233
What is our topic? Oh, what
a topic it is. Mmm-hmm.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.818
Retail consumer habits.

15:01.277 --> 15:02.861
Really? Okay.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.614
Retail consumer habits is...

15:08.325 --> 15:09.368
The only thing
you need to know

15:09.451 --> 15:10.744
about retail
consumer habits is that

15:10.828 --> 15:13.247
consumers are
mindless lemmings.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.833
They just want to
be told what to do.

15:17.751 --> 15:22.381
Fast-forward to today, and the
retail consumer is independent,

15:22.673 --> 15:26.802
well-informed, super smart.
Super smart.

15:27.511 --> 15:28.512
Okay.

15:30.931 --> 15:34.602
Shopping habits are both
seasonal and cyclical.

15:34.685 --> 15:35.811
What does this mean?

15:35.894 --> 15:36.979
I can field this one.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.188
No, sit down.

15:38.272 --> 15:42.985
Seasonal, well, the Christmas shopping
season is certainly a busy one.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.778
Back to school is as well,

15:44.862 --> 15:47.114
and in early summer
it seems to slow down a bit.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.949
But shopping is also cyclical.

15:49.033 --> 15:53.287
The menstrual cycle determines
every choice a woman makes.

15:53.704 --> 15:58.709
You see, during ovulation, a woman's
only goal is to get pregnant.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.379
During menses, she is sad
that she has failed.

16:02.504 --> 16:05.299
And how does
the woman console herself?

16:05.382 --> 16:07.760
Shopping. Shopping.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.721
Just, Jim, could you fetch me
some ice chips?

16:13.390 --> 16:17.978
Thank you. Just gonna take a
brief pause at this point.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.563
Thank you.

16:21.065 --> 16:22.483
Oh, God.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.737
Next slide.

16:29.198 --> 16:30.824
Mail call!

16:30.908 --> 16:33.952
His name is Oscar,
and he's got some mail

16:34.036 --> 16:37.998
And he better open it or go to
jail, 'cause it's your taxes

16:38.082 --> 16:41.168
His name is Kevin,
and no mail for him

16:41.251 --> 16:44.505
But he got a coupon
for some frozen yogurt

16:45.923 --> 16:47.508
Are those the lyrics?

16:47.591 --> 16:49.426
"Anderson's Three Pillars
of Retail."

16:49.510 --> 16:51.762
Crucial. So important.

16:54.098 --> 16:55.224
Next.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.810
Are there any questions?

16:58.435 --> 17:01.480
What are the Three
Pillars of Retail?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.776
Convenience.
Ingredients.

17:06.235 --> 17:07.861
Service.
Burgers.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.029
Building loyalty.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.197
Killing royalty.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.491
But truth be told,
we should really

17:12.574 --> 17:14.284
disregard
Anderson's Three Pillars.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.246
He was later
diagnosed with dementia.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.124
You know what is important?

17:20.207 --> 17:24.628
Is Dwight's pillars,
and there's only one, desire.

17:25.170 --> 17:28.590
Do we have a desire
to dominate the retail space?

17:28.674 --> 17:30.718
Not just succeed in it
but to dominate.

17:30.801 --> 17:33.137
And looking around this room,
I'm not so sure that we do.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.221
But we can get there.

17:34.304 --> 17:38.434
And I can lead us there,
and that is all that matters.

17:38.642 --> 17:41.145
Very true. Where there's
a will, there's a way.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.939
I once spent
a passionate night

17:44.064 --> 17:46.734
with Hugh Grant's brother,
John Grant.

17:46.817 --> 17:50.154
He's older than Hugh,
just a little bit uglier.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.530
How did I pull that off?

17:51.989 --> 17:54.116
Sheer force of will.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.492
That is very good, Dwight.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.870
Thank you very much.
Any other questions?

17:58.412 --> 17:59.913
Jim.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.540
You are bleeding
through your shirt.

18:02.958 --> 18:03.959
Oops.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.839
That's embarrassing.
Egg on my face.

18:10.674 --> 18:11.675
Ah...

18:13.469 --> 18:15.471
Hey, having fun?

18:15.596 --> 18:17.598
Yes, I am,
as a matter of fact.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.517
Oh, I know how it is.
I know it's a lot of fun.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.686
I don't know how it is.
Andy, this is a lame job.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.146
What are you doing here?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.356
I found my calling.

18:26.648 --> 18:31.862
Andy, when I was 12 years old, we did
a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo.

18:32.654 --> 18:37.576
I met this girl. I thought she was so perfect.
I was in love with her.

18:38.202 --> 18:41.038
But when the sun came up,
I knew it wasn't real

18:41.121 --> 18:44.249
because she was ugly
and I had grown tired of her.

18:45.209 --> 18:46.710
I know you want
Reception today,

18:46.877 --> 18:48.420
but tomorrow you
won't want to do her.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.005
She's a dog.

18:50.923 --> 18:52.841
Guys, I don't
like this analogy.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.512
Oh, fine.

19:02.643 --> 19:03.685
Did you see this?

19:03.769 --> 19:04.770
It's nice.

19:04.895 --> 19:05.938
I mean...

19:09.233 --> 19:10.442
How are you feeling?

19:10.567 --> 19:11.819
Amazing.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.403
Just lost four
ounces of appendix,

19:13.529 --> 19:15.072
already replaced
it with muscle.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.282
Can I see the wound?

19:22.746 --> 19:25.958
Oh, that's disgusting.
That's barely healed.

19:26.041 --> 19:29.002
You're not paying me to heal.
You're paying me to kick ass.

19:29.253 --> 19:33.757
A few hours ago, your body
was open like a cabinet.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.134
That's right.
That is amazing.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.469
Todd, look at that.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.846
Ch, yikes!

19:38.929 --> 19:40.055
Incoming.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.265
Not so fast.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.933
Would you come
in early tomorrow,

19:43.016 --> 19:45.102
so we could talk about the
store over breakfast?

19:45.519 --> 19:48.230
I feel you have
a lot to offer.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.606
It would be an honor, ma'am.

19:49.690 --> 19:52.651
I'll go ahead and cancel
my post-op checkup right now.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.444
I had two goals today,

19:54.528 --> 19:57.906
the first was to make myself the
clear candidate for Vice President.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.659
I achieved that,
no thanks to my appendix.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.620
The second was to find a
memorable souvenir for Philip.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.957
For that, I do have
to thank my appendix.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.887
Dunder Mifflin, how can I
help you save money on paper?

20:19.970 --> 20:21.638
This is Andrew.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.390
Hi, Andrew.
What happened to Erin?

20:23.473 --> 20:26.184
Oh, she's on an assignment in
Florida for a couple weeks.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.395
Oh, good for her.
She's such a sweetheart.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.689
You tell her Donna
Moraski misses her.

20:30.772 --> 20:33.066
I miss her, too.

20:35.611 --> 20:37.738
Everyone, we have
a very special guest.

20:37.821 --> 20:42.242
He turned an idea into a store,
into hundreds of stores.

20:42.326 --> 20:46.413
I give you Wally Amos, founder
of Famous Amos cookies.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.581
Yeah!

20:51.543 --> 20:53.337
So I hear
you're all looking to

20:53.503 --> 20:55.339
bake up some dough
in the sales game.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.425
Well, back when I
was regular Amos...

20:58.508 --> 20:59.635
What's under the cloth?

20:59.718 --> 21:01.178
We'll get to that.

21:01.303 --> 21:02.763
Cookies. I bet you
anything it's cookies.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.514
It's cookies.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.975
Let me finish my speech first.

21:07.184 --> 21:10.646
Oh, we get the gist. It's just
success and effort, isn't it?

21:10.729 --> 21:13.565
So just don't be coy.
Make with the cookies.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.526
Cookies.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.446
Famous, hi.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.157
I'm sure you get ideas
for new cookies all the time.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.452
But I...
Is it oatmeal with no raisins?

21:25.535 --> 21:26.662
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time.

21:26.787 --> 21:27.871
That's okay.
Thank you very much.
