00:00.200 --> 00:01.033
Remember,

00:01.034 --> 00:04.610
do not try anything you
are about to see at home.

00:09.350 --> 00:11.833
On this episode of Mythbusters,

00:12.200 --> 00:16.457
Adam and Jamie get feisty
with a bar fight fable.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.541
What's the matter, old man?

00:17.542 --> 00:19.534
Been too long since
your last bar fight?

00:19.599 --> 00:21.947
They want to know if
an empty beer bottle

00:21.948 --> 00:25.285
really does more
damage than a full one.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.345
Nasty.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.546
Meanwhile

00:29.547 --> 00:32.529
I have to massage the leather,
makes a better cannon.

00:32.530 --> 00:36.267
-- In a ballistic material
mystery from history.

00:37.002 --> 00:38.374
Is this where the legs were?

00:38.375 --> 00:39.732
Kari, Grant and Tory

00:39.733 --> 00:43.788
take on the mystery
of the Irish cannons.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.645
***

00:46.693 --> 00:48.893
made from leather.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.842
Who are the Mythbusters?

00:53.843 --> 00:56.387
Adam Savage.
Comes chaos. Bye bye.

00:56.388 --> 00:57.721
And Jaimie Hyneman.

00:57.722 --> 00:59.896
I call it "my little pop gun".

00:59.897 --> 01:01.839
Between them, more than 30 years

01:01.840 --> 01:04.108
of special effects and appearance.

01:04.108 --> 01:05.354
Joining them,

01:05.833 --> 01:06.798
Kari Byron,

01:06.799 --> 01:09.190
explosives and electricity.. Uhh!

01:09.647 --> 01:11.019
Tory belleci

01:11.020 --> 01:11.873
there's your big chance...

01:11.874 --> 01:13.391
And Grant Imahara.

01:13.392 --> 01:15.522
Now, for something completely
gratuitous.

01:15.523 --> 01:17.270
They don't just tell the myths,

01:17.774 --> 01:20.645
they put them to the test.

01:32.145 --> 01:33.474
We're not going to
have to start drinking

01:33.475 --> 01:35.164
in the middle of the
day again, are we?

01:35.165 --> 01:36.078
Luckily, no.

01:36.079 --> 01:38.051
This is not a myth
about getting drunk.

01:38.052 --> 01:40.654
It's about after
you've gotten drunk

01:41.110 --> 01:42.677
and gotten into a bar fight.

01:42.678 --> 01:45.685
The myth is that getting
hit with an empty bottle

01:45.686 --> 01:49.346
is worse for you than
with a bottle that's full.

01:49.347 --> 01:51.033
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.718
No silver screen bar fight scene

01:59.719 --> 02:01.823
is complete without one.

02:02.073 --> 02:05.697
However, unlike the movies,
in real life,

02:05.698 --> 02:09.096
a bottle bash is
extremely dangerous.

02:10.995 --> 02:12.198
How dangerous?

02:12.199 --> 02:14.604
Well, award winning
forensic scientists

02:14.605 --> 02:16.432
list skull fractures,

02:17.077 --> 02:20.359
concussions and scalp lacerations

02:21.546 --> 02:23.810
among the possible injuries.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.420
They also conclude that
an empty bottle smash

02:27.421 --> 02:30.923
will do more damage,
but is this really possible?

02:30.924 --> 02:32.805
Could a lighter, empty bottle

02:32.806 --> 02:36.471
really harm you more
than a heavier, full one?

02:38.016 --> 02:39.472
So, how do you want
to test this one?

02:41.785 --> 02:43.914
Fake bottle.
Don't do this at home.

02:43.915 --> 02:44.560
Seriously.

02:44.561 --> 02:46.578
How are you thinking
we should test this?

02:46.579 --> 02:49.091
Exactly like that,
but with real bottles.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.604
Except with head protection.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.676
We'll have a closer look at

02:52.677 --> 02:54.146
what kind of forces are involved.

02:54.147 --> 02:55.621
Okay.

02:58.409 --> 03:00.638
So, let the bar fight commence.

03:01.728 --> 03:03.316
Even though after the few beers,

03:03.317 --> 03:04.685
it might seem like a good idea

03:04.686 --> 03:06.902
to hit somebody over the
head with a beer bottle,

03:06.903 --> 03:08.365
it's probably not.

03:08.715 --> 03:10.992
Never the less, we feel
inclined to get up close

03:10.993 --> 03:12.567
and personal in our testing.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.922
That's where this coming in.

03:14.923 --> 03:19.034
This is a football
helmeted equipped ***

03:19.035 --> 03:21.055
with accelerometers, ***

03:27.678 --> 03:30.475
plus, a nice excuse to
hit Adam over the head.

03:30.647 --> 03:33.947
With a bottle, which I regularly
want to do.

03:33.948 --> 03:34.843
You ready?

03:35.315 --> 03:37.941
Before I put this on and take
some hits to the head...

03:37.942 --> 03:41.369
Let's put this on a non-human analog
just to make sure it's safe,

03:41.489 --> 03:43.256
to see what kind of
forces are involved.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.289
Okay.

03:48.100 --> 03:48.733
Who's ready?

03:49.406 --> 03:50.274
I'm ready.

03:50.275 --> 03:51.568
We're ready.

03:51.569 --> 03:52.612
Okay.

03:52.613 --> 03:54.992
Safety systems, check.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.284
That's not what
happens in the movies.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.166
It seems these are a lot harder
to break than we thought.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.233
I think because of a
couple of reasons.

04:09.234 --> 04:10.269
What's the matter, old man?

04:10.270 --> 04:12.019
Been too long since
your last bar fight?

04:12.020 --> 04:13.905
In the movies, you always see people

04:13.906 --> 04:15.690
smack each other over the heads
with bottles,

04:15.700 --> 04:17.451
and the bottles
break really easily.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.219
Those are fake bottles.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.565
It's the movies.

04:20.565 --> 04:25.176
Number two, who hasn't dropped
and broken bottles. They seem quite fragile.

04:25.296 --> 04:28.014
The fact is they're not.
They're actually built to ship.

04:28.015 --> 04:29.457
Built to last.

04:29.458 --> 04:34.387
When you look at shots like this,
this and this,

04:34.700 --> 04:37.894
it's pretty clear these things
are tougher than they look.

04:38.084 --> 04:41.176
Adam however,
is as tough as he looks.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.614
Not very.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.186
So, when our expert
crunches the numbers,

04:45.187 --> 04:47.826
that was kinda 107 gs.

04:48.149 --> 04:50.727
The experiment takes a safer turn.

04:50.728 --> 04:55.124
And about a hundred gs is the average
concussion that we see in the field.

04:55.765 --> 04:58.184
I don't think I'm going to
be wearing the helmet today.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.591
I don't blame you.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.725
The helmet, doing what
it was designed to do,

05:03.726 --> 05:05.406
was flexing on impact,

05:05.407 --> 05:06.774
absorbing energy

05:06.775 --> 05:10.007
and making it difficult
to break the bottle.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.632
Queue our hard-headed stunt man

05:12.633 --> 05:16.865
with his data collecting
accelerometers.

05:19.734 --> 05:21.512
***, go.

05:21.513 --> 05:22.878
- Did you get a read yet?
- Yeah.

05:22.879 --> 05:24.243
It's about 54 gs.

05:24.244 --> 05:25.340
Awesome.

05:25.341 --> 05:28.944
Awesome, but one day *** to make.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.047
So, in a frenzy of beer
and broken glass --

05:34.048 --> 05:35.026
33.

05:35.274 --> 05:38.059
Hard man Hyneman smashes away

05:38.060 --> 05:39.463
11 gs.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.992
Until he's satisfied with
a sample set of seven.

05:43.733 --> 05:44.818
34.

05:44.819 --> 05:48.259
Which yields an average of 28 gs.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.433
Awesome.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.169
Let's continue with
an empty bottle.

05:51.170 --> 05:53.607
Remember, the myth is
that an empty bottle,

05:53.608 --> 05:56.504
when smashed, is more
damaging than the full.

05:56.505 --> 05:58.739
-Are you peing?
-No.Ok

06:00.001 --> 06:02.498
it's the comparison
that's the key.

06:04.018 --> 06:05.347
Ok, here we go

06:05.348 --> 06:06.958
empty beer bottle.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.565
As the numbers come in,

06:09.566 --> 06:13.694
it's clear that comparison
does not favor is myth.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.455
13 gs.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.811
About 11 gs.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.635
Less g force to the head

06:21.636 --> 06:25.639
appears they do less
damage han the full ones,

06:26.343 --> 06:29.760
but Adam's got an issue with
the experimental design.

06:30.328 --> 06:32.942
The data seems to support the idea

06:32.943 --> 06:35.527
that it's not looking
very good for the myth,

06:35.528 --> 06:37.496
but we're seeing huge variances

06:37.497 --> 06:38.759
on the g load for this guy,

06:38.760 --> 06:40.419
depending on how
hard Jamie swings.

06:40.420 --> 06:41.711
It's just very hard to control.

06:41.712 --> 06:43.339
Clearly, moving forward,

06:43.340 --> 06:46.373
we're going to need to remove
the variance of the human arm

06:46.374 --> 06:48.489
and go with the
mechanical solution

06:48.490 --> 06:50.452
to solving this problem.

06:57.595 --> 06:58.652
All right, Kari,

06:58.653 --> 07:02.163
what do these things
have in common?

07:02.164 --> 07:04.639
Okay, creamer, cheese,
leather, chicken,

07:04.640 --> 07:06.958
duct tape and a stale pipe?

07:06.959 --> 07:08.829
Saturday night at
Adam Savage's house?

07:08.830 --> 07:10.076
Very close. No.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.975
Saturday night at
Jamie Hyneman's house?

07:12.976 --> 07:14.127
No.

07:14.128 --> 07:15.603
Ok, get everything but the leather.

07:15.604 --> 07:16.627
Well that's the next myth.

07:16.628 --> 07:17.958
We are going to try
to build a cannon

07:17.959 --> 07:19.496
out of nothing but leather.

07:19.497 --> 07:22.241
Okay, really?
Absolutely.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.888
In the 17th century,

07:23.889 --> 07:26.707
a man in Sweden
came up with a idea.

07:26.708 --> 07:29.855
A copper core with iron
bands reenforcing it

07:29.856 --> 07:32.624
massive silk fabric and finally
the entire thing

07:32.625 --> 07:33.726
was wrapped in leather.

07:33.727 --> 07:34.885
That's not a leather cannon.

07:34.886 --> 07:35.975
That's a cannon covered in leather.

07:35.976 --> 07:36.824
But wait, there's more.

07:36.825 --> 07:40.167
Later that century at the siege of *** castle,

07:40.168 --> 07:43.196
Irish troops built a cannon
using nothing but leather.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.944
It's about 5 feet long and about
5 inches thick.

07:45.945 --> 07:48.025
Leather cannon, I like it.

07:49.486 --> 07:52.237
The Mythbusters and
cannons have a long

07:52.238 --> 07:54.175
and explosive history.

07:54.926 --> 07:57.021
I think we killed Captain Kirk.

07:57.022 --> 07:59.693
There was a cheese firing cannon.

07:59.694 --> 08:02.340
A cannon made from duct tape

08:02.341 --> 08:06.744
and not to mention, the famous
cannon that fired chicken.

08:08.324 --> 08:10.398
So, who better to
get to the bottom of

08:10.399 --> 08:12.009
this mystery of history.

08:12.010 --> 08:14.223
Did the Swedes and Irish

08:14.224 --> 08:18.962
really make a viable and
effective cannon from cow skin?

08:20.900 --> 08:23.172
So, my leather man,
what's the plan?

08:23.173 --> 08:25.381
Well, we definitely need
to build both versions.

08:25.382 --> 08:26.797
Swedish and Irish.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.682
But before that, we need a benchmark.
What do you mean?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.715
We've built cannons before,

08:32.716 --> 08:34.369
but those weren't weapons of war.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.702
We need something to
compete on the battlefield.

08:36.703 --> 08:40.083
So, we need it to compare to
a cast iron period cannon.

08:40.085 --> 08:42.683
Exactly. We'll find out
how much black powder they used

08:42.683 --> 08:44.282
and how fast the projectiles come out.

08:44.283 --> 08:45.586
Yeah. On those specks,

08:45.587 --> 08:48.103
we'll be able to judge
how well they're doing.

08:48.104 --> 08:49.226
I like it.

08:49.227 --> 08:52.784
First up, down to the bomb
range to get the low down

08:52.785 --> 08:57.694
on period accurate hardware
from period accurate experts.

08:59.399 --> 09:00.608
This is Bonnie blue.

09:00.609 --> 09:02.694
The confederates tended
to name their cannon.

09:02.695 --> 09:04.702
We do that, too.

09:04.703 --> 09:06.197
Get it off the track and fire it up.

09:07.612 --> 09:09.679
We're at the alameda
county bomb range

09:09.680 --> 09:13.757
about to fire off the parrot gun.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.746
The myth we're working on

09:16.747 --> 09:20.034
says the Irish and Swedish
created a leather cannon.

09:20.035 --> 09:22.517
Now, this cannon is approximately
the same size

09:22.518 --> 09:25.296
and fires approximately
the same size ammunition

09:25.297 --> 09:26.837
as the leather cannon.

09:26.838 --> 09:29.359
You know it's time when
Grant's got his game face on.

09:30.336 --> 09:31.448
It's go time.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.661
So, we're going to fire this off,

09:34.662 --> 09:36.183
check the muzzle velocity

09:36.184 --> 09:37.768
and use that as a yardstick

09:37.769 --> 09:39.184
against the ones we want to build.

09:39.185 --> 09:40.405
Look at that. Perfect,

09:40.406 --> 09:42.201
if this doesn't
stop a cannon ball,

09:42.202 --> 09:43.499
I don't know what will.

09:43.619 --> 09:45.758
Have a stack at the union soldiers.

09:45.891 --> 09:47.846
Meanwhile, Grant is getting set up

09:47.847 --> 09:50.689
to measure what Bonnie blue can do.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.539
As you know, we love to
use the high-speed camera.

09:53.540 --> 09:56.216
Cause it gives us all these juicy
gorgeous shots

09:56.336 --> 09:58.445
of things that happen in
the blink of an eye.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.650
Today, it's going to
be a scientific tool.

10:05.651 --> 10:07.193
Come on. Let me show you.

10:08.822 --> 10:11.238
So, we aim the high speed
camera at this scale,

10:11.239 --> 10:12.614
which is set up
next to the cannon.

10:12.615 --> 10:14.221
It has one-foot inkrementes.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.847
Given a known frame rate

10:15.848 --> 10:18.744
we can count how many frames
it takes for a cannon ball

10:18.745 --> 10:20.414
to cross one of the increments.

10:20.415 --> 10:22.086
That would give us a speed,

10:22.087 --> 10:23.512
which will form the benchmark

10:23.513 --> 10:26.527
for how well our Swedish
and Irish cannons perform.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.253
Ok, let's talk black powder.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.953
Firing off the cheese cannon.

10:30.954 --> 10:33.072
Maybe this much black powder.

10:34.651 --> 10:35.313
Clear.

10:35.314 --> 10:37.391
Duct tape cannon, maybe this much.

10:39.487 --> 10:42.270
And when we blew off Buster's leg,
maybe that much.

10:44.420 --> 10:45.999
Done.

10:46.315 --> 10:49.552
This is six ounces
of black powder.

10:49.553 --> 10:52.069
That is what we will be
firing in our paired gun.

10:52.070 --> 10:53.076
Gun is loaded,

10:53.521 --> 10:56.165
alright, buzzle velocity test.
On your go.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.043
Three, two, one --

11:06.165 --> 11:07.046
good shot!

11:07.047 --> 11:08.493
That thing split it.

11:09.411 --> 11:10.770
Look at that!

11:11.034 --> 11:12.691
Bull's eye.
It is.

11:12.692 --> 11:13.964
Nice shot.

11:14.911 --> 11:16.541
So, the whole point
of today's experiment

11:16.542 --> 11:18.295
is not to find out
whether the cannon fires.

11:18.296 --> 11:19.789
We know it does.
Oh, there it is.

11:20.207 --> 11:21.552
The point is to find out

11:21.553 --> 11:25.832
how fast a real cannon could
fire a cannon the same size

11:25.833 --> 11:28.948
they were supposed to have fired.

11:28.949 --> 11:33.643
Okay, I believe we have
389 miles per hour.

11:33.644 --> 11:34.853
We have that answer.

11:34.854 --> 11:37.203
389 miles per hour.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.205
So, that's the benchmark.

11:39.206 --> 11:41.930
If the team can get their
mythical leather cannon

11:41.931 --> 11:43.426
to fire that fast,

11:43.427 --> 11:47.771
there could be some fact
to this historical fable.

11:48.848 --> 11:50.894
Next, on Mythbusters.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.290
Adam packs a porky punch.

11:59.431 --> 12:00.997
So where do we stand with the bottle bash?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.693
Sadly, we weren't able
to bash each other

12:03.694 --> 12:05.495
over the heads with bottles.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.207
We had to settle for this guy.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.284
What did he tell us?

12:09.941 --> 12:13.197
Yes. That the full bottles
somehow imparted more force

12:13.198 --> 12:14.677
than the empty bottle.

12:15.363 --> 12:17.516
-Which contradicts the myth.
-Right.

12:17.517 --> 12:20.019
Which is somehow the empty bottle
is worse for you.

12:20.020 --> 12:22.924
And given that I can't control ***

12:22.925 --> 12:24.779
how hard I hit,
it's impossible to know

12:24.780 --> 12:28.453
if it's the bottle or my
hit causing the result.

12:28.454 --> 12:32.645
What we need is some kind of
mechanical bottle bashing brig.

12:32.646 --> 12:34.824
And the setup that helps us
compare the injuries.

12:34.825 --> 12:36.651
It's like a bar fight robot.

12:36.652 --> 12:38.675
Ok. You get started on that

12:38.676 --> 12:40.293
and I'll talk to the neuro guy and

12:40.294 --> 12:41.972
I'll see what kind of injuries

12:41.973 --> 12:43.100
we're looking for on heads.

12:43.101 --> 12:44.093
Ok.

12:45.978 --> 12:48.552
So, while Adam builds
a rig to bash brains

12:48.553 --> 12:50.753
are rigorous regularity,

12:52.862 --> 12:56.030
Jamie talks to a
bash brain expert.

12:56.031 --> 12:58.258
What happens in a concussion?

12:58.259 --> 13:01.185
The concussion is when
you transfer a force

13:01.186 --> 13:03.540
external through the skull and the brain.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.192
Think of the skull as a box

13:05.193 --> 13:07.057
and you have to brain inside

13:07.058 --> 13:08.829
with the consistency of jell-o.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.100
This is your brain.

13:11.101 --> 13:13.675
I'm about to turn it
into a jell-o bowl.

13:13.676 --> 13:14.764
Here weo.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.420
There we go.

13:17.610 --> 13:20.043
One gelatin brain mold.

13:20.044 --> 13:21.519
When a concussion occurs,

13:21.520 --> 13:23.572
the force is delivered
to the skull.

13:23.573 --> 13:25.255
The skull moves relative to the brain.

13:25.256 --> 13:26.403
Brain stays in one place.

13:26.404 --> 13:27.939
The skull moves against it.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.341
That can bruise the brain
as it's hitting the skull

13:30.342 --> 13:33.355
and damage the brain
opposite that.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.735
Oh, what am I doing?

13:36.736 --> 13:39.864
I'm making gelatin brains.

13:39.865 --> 13:41.104
What are you doing?

13:41.468 --> 13:43.234
It's all a function
of force, Jamie.

13:43.235 --> 13:45.476
It's how much energy
is transmitted

13:45.477 --> 13:46.814
to the skull and to the brain.

13:46.815 --> 13:47.876
That determines

13:47.877 --> 13:49.424
how severe a concussion is

13:49.425 --> 13:51.209
or how much injury there is to the brain.

13:51.210 --> 13:52.993
There we go.

13:53.173 --> 13:54.692
That's what I'm thinking.

13:55.845 --> 13:57.956
Sounds like a bottom line
is that whatever kind of

13:57.957 --> 13:59.800
blow moves the head
more violently is

13:59.801 --> 14:02.130
what's going to cause more
of a concussion, right?

14:02.131 --> 14:03.212
Absolutely

14:03.721 --> 14:06.535
alright, the whole purpose
of this rig is to precisely

14:06.655 --> 14:08.109
and to the same speed every time

14:08.110 --> 14:10.485
to swing a beer bottle
into our model head

14:10.486 --> 14:12.352
to see if we get a concussion or...

14:12.353 --> 14:13.827
How bad a concussion we get.

14:13.828 --> 14:16.877
First, the arm is
held in tension by this spring.

14:16.878 --> 14:19.032
The vice grip holds on to the beer

14:19.033 --> 14:21.136
until it swings into the head.

14:21.137 --> 14:22.657
We release it.

14:22.658 --> 14:24.967
The arm swings around
all the way to the head.

14:24.968 --> 14:27.207
Here's the head on the
neck weighing roughly

14:27.208 --> 14:29.489
the same as a human head.

14:29.490 --> 14:31.983
Hold on, let me add the piece
of resistance...

14:33.600 --> 14:35.245
A nice gelatin brain.

14:35.246 --> 14:36.938
Now, we'll watch
this on high speed.

14:36.939 --> 14:38.904
We'll see the brain bounce around

14:38.905 --> 14:40.770
and if you can see a difference in

14:40.771 --> 14:42.753
how much the head moves
and brain bounces around,

14:42.754 --> 14:43.912
we might be able to tell something

14:43.913 --> 14:45.672
about the kind of
concussion you'll get.

14:45.673 --> 14:47.897
When someone breaks a bottle
over your head,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.502
but before the brain
bashing begins,

14:50.503 --> 14:54.805
Adam needs to know how
fast to swing his bottles.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.635
To ensure they break,

14:56.636 --> 14:57.400
for that,

14:57.401 --> 15:02.144
he's got a smaller version
of the rig and the pig.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.056
Here's the experiment to set up.

15:04.057 --> 15:05.145
I'm going take these bottles

15:05.146 --> 15:08.335
and whack this pig in the
brain until they shatter.

15:08.336 --> 15:11.336
The high speed camera
above it will tell me

15:11.337 --> 15:12.807
the exact speed at which

15:12.808 --> 15:15.620
these bottles shattered
both full and empty.

15:15.621 --> 15:18.090
This is gross science in action in

15:18.600 --> 15:21.110
three, two, one

15:27.000 --> 15:28.175
awesome.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.653
Gross. But awesome.

15:30.796 --> 15:32.825
It's a horror movie all right,

15:32.826 --> 15:35.594
but throughout the
violence of the hams --

15:36.393 --> 15:38.419
this is for the money
right here, all right?

15:41.168 --> 15:42.751
Adam gets enough hits --

15:44.600 --> 15:45.634
that has to hurt.

15:45.635 --> 15:48.035
With full and empty bottles --

15:48.400 --> 15:49.465
success.

15:49.763 --> 15:52.001
To get a good idea of the speed

15:52.002 --> 15:54.932
they need for a guaranteed smash.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.129
And that turns out to be
about 50 feet per second

15:59.130 --> 16:01.384
or 34 miles per hour.

16:01.385 --> 16:05.157
So now that this can
calibrate the swing speed,

16:05.158 --> 16:08.289
jell-o head is ready to
take one for the team.

16:14.898 --> 16:16.457
Kari, Grant and Tory

16:16.458 --> 16:18.860
are delving deep into
ballistics history

16:18.861 --> 16:23.660
to uncover two cannons
made in a tannery.

16:25.408 --> 16:27.766
We're trying to replicate
two historical cannons.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.646
Both referred to as leather cannons,

16:29.647 --> 16:31.925
the first is a Swedish cannon.

16:31.926 --> 16:33.831
It's got copper core tube

16:33.832 --> 16:36.179
and is wrapped in
some iron bands and some other stuff

16:36.180 --> 16:37.858
basically, it has a leather veneer.

16:37.859 --> 16:40.173
The second is the Irish cannon.

16:40.174 --> 16:41.861
This came from the early 1700s

16:41.862 --> 16:45.100
this is more authentic
leather cannon, if you ask me.

16:45.101 --> 16:47.941
This one's entirely
made out of the leather.

16:48.211 --> 16:50.827
With the Hyde soaked, to make it more malleable,

16:50.828 --> 16:53.731
it's time to focus on
the first of the builds.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.232
Guess which one it is?

16:55.800 --> 16:58.779
The new Grant is called
directing traffic.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.214
So, here's how you
build an authentic,

17:03.215 --> 17:06.348
17th century, all-leather cannon.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.803
Paint on the glue,

17:07.804 --> 17:10.858
insert a one-inch thick
plug at the back end.

17:12.058 --> 17:14.531
Roll the Hyde around a steel form.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.609
Hopefullythis is going
to be strong enough

17:17.991 --> 17:21.316
to with stand exploding
black powder.

17:21.317 --> 17:25.516
Laminate enough layers to
ensure a one-inch barrel.

17:25.517 --> 17:27.251
With a 5 inch diametre.

17:27.252 --> 17:31.424
Is it just me or it's our badass cannon
look more like a hotdog?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.747
Tie it off and wait for it to dry.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.412
It's a not the prettiest thing,

17:35.413 --> 17:36.798
but I think it will work.

17:37.047 --> 17:38.459
That's what they said
when they hired me.

17:41.007 --> 17:44.225
With the Irish cannon wrapped
up and ready to blow,

17:45.400 --> 17:48.756
Grant in a more cultural sensitive fashion
than Tory,

17:48.757 --> 17:51.640
is going to give us the
background on the Swedish cannon.

17:51.641 --> 17:52.968
In the 1600s in Europe,

17:52.969 --> 17:55.633
everybody had pretty much a
same design for a cannon.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.833
Giant, cast iron.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.085
Unfortunately,
these were incredibly heavy

18:01.086 --> 18:04.538
and it took several men and horses

18:04.539 --> 18:06.659
just to move them into position.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.528
Along came the king of Sweden,

18:08.529 --> 18:11.232
king gustavul adolphus the 2nd.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.167
Who had a new idea for an army.

18:13.168 --> 18:14.979
An army that was incredibly mobile

18:14.980 --> 18:16.328
that could deploy quickly.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.261
He threw out this idea of a cannon

18:19.262 --> 18:21.408
and came up with something
that was lighter

18:21.409 --> 18:22.728
and more affordable.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.379
Now, in truth, there wasn't much leather
in the Swedish leather cannon.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.779
In fact, it had a thin wall copper tube
for its barrel.

18:31.425 --> 18:33.585
Which basic sought off the leather cannon.

18:33.586 --> 18:35.458
With the brass plug on the end.

18:37.424 --> 18:39.502
That was covered
with several layers

18:39.503 --> 18:41.258
of canvas soaked in mastic.

18:41.259 --> 18:42.699
What the heck is mastic?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.172
It's a type of resin.

18:44.173 --> 18:45.473
Now we don't have mastic.

18:45.474 --> 18:48.549
But what we do have is a two part
epoxy resin.

18:48.550 --> 18:52.530
On top of that, four iron
bands to reenforce it.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.301
Then, more canvas and mastic,

18:54.302 --> 18:55.217
then we paint another layer.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.672
Cause that way, it gets embedded,

18:56.673 --> 18:59.206
when it hardens,
it's going to be very strong.

18:59.207 --> 19:02.048
Finally, on the top, was leather.

19:02.049 --> 19:03.681
Now, it was called the leather cannon,

19:03.682 --> 19:04.998
but in fact, it was a hybrid.

19:04.999 --> 19:07.200
It had a metal barrel.

19:07.201 --> 19:08.769
The important thing is that

19:08.770 --> 19:10.482
it was lightweight and mobile.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.141
Mobile, you say,

19:12.142 --> 19:13.540
well, with these wheels,

19:13.541 --> 19:15.538
they can roll on down
to the bomb range

19:17.070 --> 19:19.494
where we'll find out if
these mythical cannons

19:19.495 --> 19:20.851
built to speck,

19:20.852 --> 19:22.443
could have really worked.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.878
After the break,

19:23.879 --> 19:27.094
jell-o head is left dazed,
confused.

19:27.095 --> 19:28.590
And lobotomized.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.465
A delicious memory.

19:35.099 --> 19:37.516
It's a counterintuitive problem.

19:37.517 --> 19:40.927
Scientists tell us
an empty beer bottle

19:40.928 --> 19:42.543
broken on your brain box

19:42.544 --> 19:44.037
will cause more damage

19:44.038 --> 19:46.310
than a heavier, full one.

19:49.082 --> 19:50.134
Looking for answers,

19:50.135 --> 19:52.774
Jamie and Adam are
lining up jell-o head

19:52.775 --> 19:55.145
for a comparative concussion test.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.963
Okay, here we go.

19:56.964 --> 19:59.768
One full beer bottle
concussion test

19:59.769 --> 20:03.475
in three, two, one

20:08.528 --> 20:09.420
it looks great.

20:10.570 --> 20:11.674
Seems to work.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.370
Except it doesn't.

20:13.371 --> 20:14.947
Look at the high speed.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.722
Confirms the beer isn't clear.

20:19.723 --> 20:23.390
The problem is that the beer
is obstructing our ability to see the brain.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.472
Isn't that always the way?

20:27.800 --> 20:31.413
So, the way to go
is carbonated h20.

20:32.178 --> 20:33.439
All ready. Let's do it.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.807
Full bottle, concussion test,

20:35.808 --> 20:38.173
three, two, one

20:42.490 --> 20:43.632
didn't break.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.306
High speed. High speed.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.788
That's a lot of force.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.615
You see how the skull moves

20:55.616 --> 20:57.763
and then the brain's
in one place. Yeah.

20:57.764 --> 21:00.863
Hits the side of the skull
on the front side,

21:01.111 --> 21:01.879
then look at that,

21:01.880 --> 21:04.140
the brain's going
completely to the opposite.

21:04.141 --> 21:05.080
Oh, wow.

21:05.105 --> 21:07.667
Look at the waves
inside the jell-o.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.629
That's what happens in real life.

21:10.857 --> 21:12.904
The full bottle hit clearly falls

21:12.905 --> 21:15.386
into the not good category.

21:15.387 --> 21:16.269
Another wasted beer.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.594
Cue the empty bottle comparison.

21:18.595 --> 21:20.529
Somewhere, kittens are crying.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.366
What do you think's
going to happen, buddy?

21:29.700 --> 21:30.794
Really?

21:33.058 --> 21:34.862
No, I never saw it
that way before.

21:37.142 --> 21:39.158
Okay. You ready for
the empty bottle?

21:39.159 --> 21:41.338
Ready. All right, empty bottle

21:41.339 --> 21:42.451
concussion test.

21:42.452 --> 21:44.770
Three, two, one --

21:48.505 --> 21:50.177
I don't even need to
see the high speed.

21:50.178 --> 21:53.257
I can tell my looking at the
guy's face that he's messed up.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.371
Sure, he's not a pretty sight,

21:55.372 --> 21:59.459
but he's better off than
after the last test.

21:59.460 --> 22:03.210
The lateral movement of the
skull is significantly reduced

22:03.211 --> 22:04.300
after the empty bottle.

22:04.420 --> 22:08.292
Where there is nowhere near the amount of
head movement relative to brain.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.017
So, it is moving around,

22:10.018 --> 22:12.601
but not near as much as
after the full bottle.

22:12.602 --> 22:16.053
Yeah, you're delivering
less force with an empty bottle.

22:16.054 --> 22:17.569
No question.

22:17.851 --> 22:18.633
Awesome.

22:18.634 --> 22:20.072
That's like a result.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.656
Let's put the two up
next to each other,

22:22.657 --> 22:24.930
just like that, okay, now, play.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.756
Look at that. Couldn't be clearer.

22:27.757 --> 22:30.129
The full bottle is far worse.

22:30.130 --> 22:34.932
That's another headache for this
forensic- science inspired myth.

22:34.933 --> 22:38.318
So far, Adam and Jamie
have yet to see a sign

22:38.319 --> 22:39.678
that an empty bottle,

22:39.679 --> 22:42.350
when smashed,
can cause more damage,

22:42.351 --> 22:44.442
but they're not done yet.

22:44.758 --> 22:46.618
The additional mass
in a full bottle

22:46.619 --> 22:49.111
does seem to impart
more energy over a skull

22:49.112 --> 22:50.455
when it's broken over it

22:50.456 --> 22:52.424
and that can lead to a concussion,

22:52.774 --> 22:55.281
but we're talking about
head injury here.

22:55.282 --> 22:57.786
That could be skull fractures,

22:57.787 --> 22:59.619
skin lacerations.

22:59.982 --> 23:02.258
We're going to have a
close look at those, too.

23:03.052 --> 23:04.899
Remember that time
I built a machine

23:04.900 --> 23:07.123
to swing bottles of
beer at your head?

23:10.500 --> 23:11.590
No, you don't.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.402
It's a delicious memory.

23:14.759 --> 23:16.213
Coming up, on Mythbusters,

23:16.214 --> 23:19.710
can you really build a
leather cannon that works?

23:21.708 --> 23:24.113
Don't try anything you see
on this show at home.

23:24.114 --> 23:26.523
We're what you call experts.

23:29.745 --> 23:30.923
All right,
so here's where we're at.

23:30.924 --> 23:33.372
So far, we've tested
out the parrot rifle.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.059
Which is an all-metal barrel cannon.

23:41.857 --> 23:44.261
We found out how fast that
can fire a cannon ball.

23:44.262 --> 23:47.111
389 miles per hour.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.429
Now, we're going to test
out the Swedish cannon,

23:50.430 --> 23:53.798
in which most of the leather
barrel has been replaced

23:53.799 --> 23:56.103
by other materials
to make it lighter.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.743
Let's go to battle!

23:57.744 --> 24:00.336
Then, we'll move on to
the Irish leather cannon.

24:00.337 --> 24:02.654
Which is all leather.

24:02.655 --> 24:06.374
I have six ounces of black powder.

24:06.375 --> 24:09.056
This is what we're gonna be using
to propel our cannon ball.

24:09.057 --> 24:10.490
When we fired the parrot gun,

24:10.491 --> 24:13.328
it was traveling at
389 miles per hour.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.408
That is fast.

24:14.409 --> 24:17.384
The same amount of
energy hitting a baseball

24:17.385 --> 24:19.156
going 1200 miles per hour.

24:19.157 --> 24:21.960
Folks, this is something you
don't want to play with.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.612
So, with a firm grip on the potential
explosive involved,

24:25.613 --> 24:27.566
with all the technical jargon,

24:27.567 --> 24:29.267
ok, where's the pokey stick?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.306
The team lock and load.

24:31.307 --> 24:32.443
Venting.

24:33.579 --> 24:34.611
All right, loaded.

24:34.612 --> 24:35.823
Okay, going to go.

24:36.105 --> 24:37.677
You ready? I'm ready.

24:37.678 --> 24:39.115
Fire in the hole!

24:39.471 --> 24:41.284
This is Swedish cannon

24:41.285 --> 24:45.593
in three, two, one

24:48.000 --> 24:50.688
-- yeah! Look at that.

24:50.689 --> 24:51.987
It worked. Sweet.

24:52.557 --> 24:54.148
Or did it.

24:55.026 --> 24:56.512
Now, when we came out here,
some of us

24:56.513 --> 24:58.660
thought this was going to
shoot off like a cannon.

24:58.661 --> 25:00.437
Some thought it was
going to explode.

25:00.438 --> 25:01.908
Pretty much did both.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.358
Look at that.

25:06.359 --> 25:10.940
It just completely
blew out the back end.

25:10.941 --> 25:14.915
Well -- one shot wonder.

25:14.916 --> 25:16.419
We actually had the cannon ball

25:16.420 --> 25:17.637
shoot out of one end

25:17.638 --> 25:20.392
while the end bits
shot out the other.

25:20.483 --> 25:22.570
It's not looking too good,

25:23.609 --> 25:25.615
but a quick look
at the assessments

25:25.616 --> 25:28.171
and the team are more positive.

25:28.172 --> 25:30.207
Hey, it did the job. Come on.

25:30.208 --> 25:32.137
Give it up for the Swedish cannon.

25:32.138 --> 25:33.730
It did make it through the sandbags,

25:33.731 --> 25:35.487
and it did make it through
the second barrel

25:35.579 --> 25:37.570
and once the numbers are crunched,

25:37.571 --> 25:39.398
it gets even more interesting.

25:39.399 --> 25:40.983
We tested it with the same

25:40.984 --> 25:42.964
size and weight cannon ball,

25:42.965 --> 25:44.415
the same amount of black powder

25:44.416 --> 25:47.827
getting 667 feet per second,

25:47.828 --> 25:50.103
over 450 miles per hour.

25:50.104 --> 25:53.088
That's faster than our parrot gun.

25:53.089 --> 25:53.820
What?

25:53.821 --> 25:56.615
I've got to say,
it's performance was equal to

25:56.616 --> 26:00.838
or a little bit better
than the all metal cannon.

26:00.839 --> 26:03.125
It had a muzzle velocity that was higher

26:03.126 --> 26:04.604
maybe it was a tighter pack

26:04.605 --> 26:06.696
so that way it shot
the ball faster.

26:06.697 --> 26:07.490
Who knows.

26:07.491 --> 26:09.960
We only missed the x by that much.

26:09.961 --> 26:12.364
Minor problem,
we blew out the breach,

26:12.365 --> 26:13.572
but bear in mind,

26:13.573 --> 26:16.837
this was our first attempt
to make this type of cannon.

26:16.886 --> 26:19.573
I'm sure the Swedish didn't
get it right the first time,

26:19.574 --> 26:21.398
so as far as a battlefield weapon,

26:21.399 --> 26:26.125
it had good maneuverability.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.342
Unfortunately, longevity
can be a problem.

26:29.343 --> 26:32.362
And as it turns out historically,
it was.

26:32.363 --> 26:36.059
So, in the context of the parrot
rifle performance benchmark,

26:36.060 --> 26:39.076
the lightweight hybrid
cannon matched up,

26:39.200 --> 26:42.429
which just lves the
Irish question.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.432
Wheels came off. It's mine.

26:44.433 --> 26:46.402
We've got six ounces
of black powder.

26:46.403 --> 26:48.551
Alright, ready to load?
Black powder...

26:48.552 --> 26:50.064
A three-pound cannon ball.

26:50.832 --> 26:51.967
That's nice and tight.

26:51.968 --> 26:54.556
And a barrel that's
one-inch thick of leather.

26:54.557 --> 26:58.043
You add all that up, I think
you're gonna get a boom.

26:58.044 --> 27:00.293
Everybody clear
muzzle from now on.

27:00.294 --> 27:03.250
This whole idea of building
a cannon out of leather,

27:03.251 --> 27:04.450
it's absurd.

27:04.451 --> 27:06.182
No way.
Loaded.

27:06.183 --> 27:07.288
I mean, if you're desperate and

27:07.289 --> 27:09.181
that's the only material
you have available to you,

27:09.182 --> 27:10.981
sure, why not try it.

27:10.982 --> 27:14.123
We know how powerful
exploding black powder is.

27:14.124 --> 27:15.478
One Irish leather cannon.

27:15.479 --> 27:17.946
Alright, this is Irish leather
cannon, ready?

27:17.947 --> 27:19.241
The forces involved,

27:19.242 --> 27:23.369
a one-inch wall of leather going
to be enough to contain it.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.140
In order to launch this cannon ball.

27:25.141 --> 27:26.380
Fire in the hole.

27:26.381 --> 27:28.347
I'm very curious to find out.

27:28.348 --> 27:29.075
Three,

27:29.076 --> 27:31.770
my feeling is it's
probably not going to work.

27:31.771 --> 27:34.693
Two, one --

27:39.800 --> 27:40.977
nice.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.329
Look what happened.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.599
Look where the cannon ball is.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.394
It's like 2 feet from it.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.389
It was more dangerous to
be behind than in front.

27:54.300 --> 27:55.422
Yep, it's pretty clear

27:55.423 --> 27:58.839
the Irish cannon
failed on all counts.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.719
The back end blew out and
even with modern blue,

28:01.720 --> 28:03.369
the barrel unravelled,

28:03.370 --> 28:05.929
so the guys can't even try again.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.699
What we were looking for,
for this myth to be confirmed,

28:08.700 --> 28:10.854
it was very simple, lethality.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.242
Say the Irish were fighting the leprechauns.
It might be lethal.

28:14.321 --> 28:16.380
Look how far the cannon ball is.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.864
We tested the parrot rifle

28:17.865 --> 28:19.072
and the Swedish leather cannon.

28:19.073 --> 28:22.149
With the same amount of gunfire,

28:22.150 --> 28:23.658
they were able to launch the ball

28:23.659 --> 28:26.849
at 150 to 350 miles per hour.

28:26.850 --> 28:29.422
Now, as far as the Irish leather cannon
goes,

28:29.423 --> 28:31.073
I can't call that lethal.
No.

28:31.074 --> 28:32.798
With the best
available information

28:32.799 --> 28:34.325
built to those specifications,

28:34.700 --> 28:36.303
this one is busted.

28:36.304 --> 28:38.308
But that does not mean
we're going to end here.

28:38.309 --> 28:39.332
We are going to see

28:39.333 --> 28:41.885
what it would take to
build a working cannon

28:41.886 --> 28:43.657
out of nothing but leather.

28:43.658 --> 28:44.842
Might not be possible,

28:45.154 --> 28:46.287
but we're going to try.

28:46.453 --> 28:49.535
Coming up, Jamie brings
meat head to life

28:49.870 --> 28:52.926
before bashed his brain
with a beer bottle.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.910
Adam and Jamie have
already seen that

28:59.911 --> 29:01.620
as far as concussions go,

29:01.621 --> 29:03.111
contrary to the myth,

29:03.112 --> 29:07.328
a full-bottle smash is worse
for you than an empty.

29:08.284 --> 29:10.811
But what about other
types of head trauma?

29:10.812 --> 29:13.092
What about a skull fracture?

29:13.179 --> 29:15.146
To find out, Jamie --

29:15.147 --> 29:16.804
that's what I'm talking about.

29:16.805 --> 29:19.334
Is taking a piece of pig skull --

29:20.000 --> 29:23.213
seven millimeters.
Same thickness as the human skull.

29:23.214 --> 29:27.243
To calibrate an manufacture
polley urthane plastic.

29:27.244 --> 29:30.020
That fracture is in exactly the same way

29:30.021 --> 29:31.893
as a human skull.

29:31.894 --> 29:34.044
Pulled from the pen while pliable,

29:34.045 --> 29:36.908
it forms it into shape before it hardens.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.464
We've got the base and insert

29:40.465 --> 29:42.116
that goes over this cavity and

29:42.117 --> 29:45.122
when we hit it like so,

29:45.123 --> 29:46.482
if we get a fracture,

29:46.483 --> 29:49.348
we know that we would have
fractured a real skull.

29:49.349 --> 29:51.182
To get a realistic mass,

29:51.183 --> 29:54.441
Jamie adds a brain's
weight of ground beef.

29:54.442 --> 29:56.089
Six pounds.

29:56.508 --> 29:58.301
Meanwhile, Adam has built a bar.

29:58.302 --> 30:01.225
For the soon the break out bar fight.

30:01.226 --> 30:02.899
Welcome to the Mythbusters bar.

30:03.195 --> 30:05.267
Can I interest you
in an empty beer?

30:08.300 --> 30:11.782
Which means meat head,
with his inability to duck,

30:11.783 --> 30:13.409
was about to get a headache.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.904
It's time to bash some heads

30:15.905 --> 30:19.234
in and choose some gum.*****

30:19.620 --> 30:20.526
take it away.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.404
Okay, skull fracture rate in

30:23.405 --> 30:26.227
three, two, one --

30:28.793 --> 30:30.545
all hell broke loose.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.864
We got broken bottles,
we got broken head,

30:36.865 --> 30:39.166
Ã¤Â» meat spilling out
all over the place.

30:39.167 --> 30:40.312
Adam's not doctor,

30:40.313 --> 30:43.599
but broken head and meat spilling out

30:43.600 --> 30:46.424
that's a fairly
accurate diagnosis.

30:46.425 --> 30:48.661
Oh, man.

30:48.662 --> 30:52.002
It's clearly shattered the skull.

30:52.003 --> 30:54.817
Totally shattered the skull.

30:54.818 --> 30:56.450
Meat head did us proud.

30:56.451 --> 30:59.200
All we need now is to try
this with an empty bottle.

30:59.201 --> 31:01.525
Yeah. More data.

31:01.887 --> 31:04.291
More data with a side of sampling

31:04.292 --> 31:08.652
and a comparative observation
salad coming right up.

31:09.286 --> 31:11.467
Empty bottle of beer
coming right up.

31:11.468 --> 31:13.802
Buddy, we're going to do
this at least one more time

31:13.803 --> 31:17.137
and it's going to hurt you a lot

31:17.138 --> 31:18.818
more than it's going to hurt me.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.464
When you're ready.

31:20.465 --> 31:23.422
Empty bottle into
skull fracture rig.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.257
Three, two, one

31:27.500 --> 31:28.866
that's what I'm talking about.

31:28.867 --> 31:30.058
One --

31:32.302 --> 31:33.458
now you broke it.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.596
That's why we can't
have nice things.

31:37.044 --> 31:39.286
No fracture on the skull.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.187
The whole purpose of this

31:42.188 --> 31:43.743
experiment is to figure out

31:43.744 --> 31:46.001
if it's worse to have a full

31:46.002 --> 31:47.834
or empty bottle
broken over your head.

31:47.835 --> 31:49.916
Personally, I want neither.

31:50.334 --> 31:51.861
If I had to choose

31:51.862 --> 31:55.146
especially, when it comes to
skull fractures, like this test here.

31:55.147 --> 31:59.107
The full bottle delivers more
force than the empty bottle.

31:59.108 --> 32:02.524
But upon close examination,

32:02.525 --> 32:06.536
Jamie and I note many
lacerations in the skull

32:06.537 --> 32:07.942
of this meat head.

32:07.943 --> 32:09.044
And we wonder,

32:09.396 --> 32:12.513
perhaps in the area
of lacerations,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.820
an empty bottle might be
worse than a full bottle.

32:14.821 --> 32:16.101
We don't know.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.378
We're going to start
to skin the heads

32:18.379 --> 32:20.499
and start hitting that
with broken bottles.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.198
Down at the bomb range,

32:26.199 --> 32:30.563
the myth of the Irish
all-leather cannon tooa hiding.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.453
I just can't call that lethal.

32:32.454 --> 32:34.166
No, I mean, that's pathetic.

32:35.339 --> 32:38.170
But our team of tenors aren't done yet.

32:38.171 --> 32:41.075
They set themselves the challenge
of building

32:41.076 --> 32:43.380
an effective viable cannon

32:43.381 --> 32:45.359
from nothing but cow Hyde.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.837
I have to massage the leather.

32:46.838 --> 32:48.019
It makes a better cannon.

32:48.020 --> 32:50.842
Actually, what makes a
better leather cannon,

32:50.843 --> 32:52.376
his attention to detail

32:52.377 --> 32:53.624
and this time around,

32:53.625 --> 32:56.613
the team is going all out
to iron out the issues

32:56.614 --> 32:58.228
from its last outing.

32:58.229 --> 33:00.125
One thing we figured
out the other day,

33:00.126 --> 33:03.345
we fired out pure leather cannon,
when the ball came out,

33:03.346 --> 33:06.282
it actually delaminated
the inside of the cannon,

33:06.283 --> 33:09.058
so I'm scraping up this leather,

33:09.059 --> 33:11.746
enough so that the glue will bite
down on this leather,

33:11.747 --> 33:12.796
enough so that it
will stay together

33:12.797 --> 33:14.365
when we fire the next cannon.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.636
So just like everything else
on this cannon,

33:16.637 --> 33:18.892
we're baking it up, so to speak.

33:18.893 --> 33:21.080
This is our super breach plug.

33:21.575 --> 33:24.126
Made out of 42 layers of leather.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.719
It's going to get
rolled into the cannon.

33:26.056 --> 33:28.415
Charge goes here, cannon ball goes here.

33:28.416 --> 33:30.422
When we set it off,
hopefully it goes like

33:31.513 --> 33:32.553
-- and that like --

33:35.481 --> 33:37.106
now, I'm working on
the breach section.

33:37.107 --> 33:39.177
What I've done is take
the same cow hide,

33:39.178 --> 33:41.106
cut it down to two-inch strips

33:41.107 --> 33:43.474
I'm putting down the contact cement
on both sides

33:43.475 --> 33:45.891
then laying those
strips lengthwise

33:45.892 --> 33:47.779
around the back of the cannon.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.897
This is gonna straighten up
our breach area.

33:49.898 --> 33:51.821
That way, it is strong enough to

33:51.822 --> 33:53.944
withstand the explosion
of black powder

33:53.945 --> 33:56.592
to get our cannon to launch.

33:56.593 --> 33:59.094
With the

33:59.095 --> 34:01.749
end glued into submission,

34:01.750 --> 34:05.009
the team is optimistic about
their chances of success.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.646
This is the blast chamber

34:06.647 --> 34:08.918
we're talking about
a 12-inch diameter.

34:08.918 --> 34:12.237
Not only that, but the breach
was reinforced with so many straps

34:12.239 --> 34:15.500
we have about that much
holding up the back end.

34:15.501 --> 34:17.699
I think there might
be a possibility

34:17.699 --> 34:21.148
that we've made ourselves
a working leather cannon.

34:21.431 --> 34:24.047
Now, I have a few
finishing touches.

34:24.402 --> 34:26.783
Just to give it a
little bit of beauty.

34:27.027 --> 34:29.369
So, under a veil of secrecy,

34:29.370 --> 34:33.841
our material girl applies her fashionable
finishing touches.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.516
Then, it's back down
to the bomb range.

34:37.516 --> 34:38.944
Drumroll please.

34:40.300 --> 34:42.252
The big reveal.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.359
I was getting bored with the
plain old leather cannon,

34:44.360 --> 34:45.822
since we did so many.

34:45.822 --> 34:49.880
I thought, why not
jazz it up a little.

34:49.882 --> 34:51.674
It's a designer cannon.

34:51.675 --> 34:54.329
That is crazy. That is funny.

34:54.330 --> 34:56.004
You just pimped this cannon up.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.374
It looks the business,

34:57.375 --> 34:59.171
but can it pack the punch?

34:59.172 --> 35:01.726
A six-ounce black powder punch.

35:01.727 --> 35:06.566
It's going expand to
355 gallons of gas.

35:06.567 --> 35:07.729
That is a lot of energy.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.263
What's going to fire the
ball out of the cannon.

35:10.264 --> 35:11.988
Or ***

35:12.577 --> 35:13.824
either way, it's gonna be cool.

35:13.825 --> 35:17.029
Next, violence of the
hands may be over,

35:17.030 --> 35:20.150
but Jamie puts the
lotion on the skin.

35:20.360 --> 35:24.271
And finally ...
Kari has disguised our cannon as a purse.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.250
Will the luggage
leather be lethal?

35:32.318 --> 35:34.392
As far as having a bottle
smashed over your head,

35:34.393 --> 35:36.457
at this point,
we've looked at concussions.

35:38.220 --> 35:39.670
So, it is moving around,

35:39.671 --> 35:42.814
but not as much as with
a full bottle. Yeah.

35:42.815 --> 35:44.615
We've looked at skull fractures.

35:47.239 --> 35:49.372
No skull fracture.
No skull fracture,

35:49.373 --> 35:52.308
but check out how nasty
the lacerations are.

35:52.309 --> 35:54.703
We also need to look
at last lacerations.

35:54.704 --> 35:57.763
Cause, after all, it's broken glass, skin,

35:57.764 --> 35:59.292
we're going to get cut.

35:59.293 --> 36:02.084
If I'm going to test what
happens to someone's scalp

36:02.085 --> 36:03.830
when hit over the
head with a bottle,

36:04.300 --> 36:06.651
I need a suitable scalp.

36:06.652 --> 36:09.744
And to find it, Dr. frankenheim

36:09.745 --> 36:13.486
figures out some skull attributes
he wants to emulate.

36:13.487 --> 36:17.015
That's moving about the same
as the skin over my skull.

36:18.952 --> 36:22.111
*** through it, 2.43 pounds.

36:22.112 --> 36:24.428
This is sort of fibrous.

36:24.429 --> 36:27.020
Next, he finds is
artificial materials

36:27.021 --> 36:29.372
with those attributes.

36:29.373 --> 36:32.067
The veinal epidermus, absorbent

36:32.068 --> 36:35.313
subcutaneous layers and of course, blood.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.070
It all comes together

36:39.071 --> 36:43.202
into disturbingly accurate analog
of human skin.

36:43.203 --> 36:47.076
The epidermis goes on it
like so and when I cut it,

36:47.077 --> 36:49.517
with any luck,
it's going to bleed.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.136
And with that -- there you go.

36:54.137 --> 36:57.260
Our fake skin meat head is ready

36:57.261 --> 36:59.093
to take one for the team.

36:59.780 --> 37:01.616
Let the lacerations begin.

37:01.617 --> 37:03.844
In the laceration test,
with the full bear bottle,

37:03.845 --> 37:05.771
three, two --

37:10.400 --> 37:11.210
nasty.

37:11.211 --> 37:12.139
One --

37:19.674 --> 37:21.446
there's definitely
some cuts there.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.366
Yep.

37:23.037 --> 37:25.053
It bleeds. Nasty.

37:25.054 --> 37:27.320
Nasty and if it was needed,

37:27.321 --> 37:29.641
a further graphic illustration of

37:29.642 --> 37:33.062
how dangerous it is to
use a bottle as a weapon.

37:33.063 --> 37:34.151
Just put the other one there

37:34.152 --> 37:36.617
and the other there.

37:36.618 --> 37:39.058
That's our full bottle

37:39.059 --> 37:40.544
compared to the empty one.

37:40.545 --> 37:41.640
Okay.

37:45.300 --> 37:46.429
Okay, here we go.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.045
Laceration test,

37:48.046 --> 37:51.245
empty beer bottle
into our meat Buster.

37:52.915 --> 37:55.145
Three, two, one--

37:57.746 --> 38:01.026
a successful smash and
as with the full bottle,

38:01.027 --> 38:04.131
it's immediately obvious
damage was done.

38:04.504 --> 38:07.502
I like my fake skin.
It's a nice fake skin.

38:08.207 --> 38:10.358
And an up-close comparison sees

38:10.359 --> 38:12.388
little difference in the damage

38:12.389 --> 38:14.745
to that skin between
the two tests.

38:14.746 --> 38:16.131
I don't know about you, but I look at these

38:16.132 --> 38:17.858
and they look pretty
much equivalent to me.

38:17.859 --> 38:19.836
You know, give or take a neck or two,

38:19.837 --> 38:21.538
it's the same.
Yeah.

38:22.685 --> 38:25.472
The original myth is that having
an empty bottle broken over your head

38:25.473 --> 38:28.209
is worse for you than a full bottle?

38:28.700 --> 38:32.198
From our testing, it's not true.

38:32.199 --> 38:33.739
You get a much worse concussion

38:33.740 --> 38:35.474
from a full bottle than empty one.

38:35.475 --> 38:37.115
And also, from our testing,

38:37.116 --> 38:39.748
on bones, the full
bottle is also worse.

38:39.749 --> 38:42.362
It's more likely to
cause a skull fracture.

38:42.732 --> 38:45.158
Now, the skin laceration test,

38:45.159 --> 38:46.631
actually, for the first time,

38:46.632 --> 38:47.770
they're about even.

38:47.771 --> 38:49.543
But that still doesn't
make the statement

38:49.544 --> 38:51.951
that the empty bottle
is supportable.

38:51.952 --> 38:53.962
So, still not looking very good.

38:53.963 --> 38:56.596
I'd almost say it's busted.

38:57.200 --> 39:00.180
Okay. The myth that it's worse
to have an empty bottle

39:00.181 --> 39:01.499
over a full bottle,

39:01.500 --> 39:04.783
let's recap from the
standpoint of your brain?

39:04.784 --> 39:05.488
Busted.

39:05.489 --> 39:07.500
From the standpoint of your skull bone,

39:07.501 --> 39:08.677
also busted.

39:08.678 --> 39:10.505
From the standpoint of your skin,

39:10.506 --> 39:11.338
no difference.

39:11.339 --> 39:13.364
-That leaves this myth.
- Busted.

39:13.365 --> 39:14.883
Totally busted.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.910
Kari, Grant and Tory

39:29.911 --> 39:31.342
are about to find out if

39:31.343 --> 39:34.087
leather can be a lethal cannon.

39:34.485 --> 39:37.714
This is our target. We have a barrier
of milk pack by triangulation

39:37.715 --> 39:39.225
of three water barrels.

39:39.226 --> 39:40.431
Why milk?

39:40.432 --> 39:42.341
Because it's going look
really cool on high speed

39:42.342 --> 39:44.405
when your cannon
ball crashes into it.

39:44.406 --> 39:45.804
And speaking of high speed,

39:45.805 --> 39:47.960
with the aid of the high speed
and this scale here,

39:47.961 --> 39:50.282
we're going to be able to
catch the velocity of the ball

39:50.283 --> 39:51.920
and see if it matches
our parrot gun.

39:51.921 --> 39:53.713
And here,

39:53.714 --> 39:57.057
we have a designer-inspired ultimately
completely reinforced

39:57.058 --> 40:00.169
100% genuine leather cannon.

40:00.170 --> 40:02.431
If only the Irish had
something this stylish.

40:02.432 --> 40:04.513
The siege of *** castle,

40:04.514 --> 40:06.893
well, who knows if the cannon
would have exploded

40:06.894 --> 40:08.880
but, at least they'd be...
Fighting in style.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.004
However, it's not style,

40:11.005 --> 40:14.406
but performance substance
that ultimately matters.

40:14.407 --> 40:16.735
Remember, the
benchmark we're using

40:16.736 --> 40:19.141
is the parrot rifles
muzzle velocity

40:19.142 --> 40:22.517
of 389 miles per hour, plus,

40:22.518 --> 40:26.695
it has to be capable of multiple,
successful firing.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.881
Oh, man, this is the prettiest
cannon I've ever seen.

40:29.882 --> 40:33.153
Kari has described her
cannon as a purse.

40:33.154 --> 40:36.953
All it needs now is that favorite,
slippery solution.

40:36.954 --> 40:39.757
I saw that on dirty jobs once.
Really? - Yeah.

40:39.758 --> 40:42.134
Except it was a cow, right?
Yeah, whatever.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.393
Don't worry, Betsy.

40:45.111 --> 40:47.289
So, why we lubing up our barrel? Well...

40:47.290 --> 40:49.721
The last time we tried
the Irish leather cannon,

40:49.722 --> 40:51.535
built to historical
specifications,

40:51.536 --> 40:54.519
the cannon had a hard time
of getting out of the barrel,

40:54.520 --> 40:56.729
*** delaminate the inner most layer.

40:56.730 --> 40:58.216
We don't want that to happen this time.

40:58.217 --> 41:00.474
So we're adding
lube and hopefully,

41:00.475 --> 41:02.651
it will go shooting
right out the end.

41:03.219 --> 41:04.567
You in? Yep.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.576
That's it.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.889
Let's do it.

41:08.581 --> 41:10.846
I think we have a
very good chance.

41:10.847 --> 41:12.590
80% at at least.

41:12.591 --> 41:14.863
20% if it explodes.

41:15.201 --> 41:19.951
So, it's time to find out if
the bling leather cannon can.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.573
Here we go,
designer-inspired cannon,

41:23.745 --> 41:27.401
three, two, one

41:39.400 --> 41:40.148
we did it!

41:40.149 --> 41:41.764
We made a leather cannon!

41:45.933 --> 41:47.892
Is reaction says it all.

41:47.893 --> 41:50.653
We've made a leather
cannon and it worked.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.637
The test looks to be a success,

41:54.638 --> 41:55.845
but up close,

41:55.846 --> 42:00.047
the evidence begins to contradict
their initial reaction.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.872
Punched through the carton,
no problem.

42:05.193 --> 42:06.739
Unlike the parrot rifle,

42:06.740 --> 42:09.792
which easily punched
through two water barrels,

42:09.793 --> 42:13.475
the leather cannon only just
pierced the milk carton.

42:14.266 --> 42:17.070
You're going to give
somebody a bruise with that.

42:18.500 --> 42:22.689
The assessment is backed
up from the numbers.

42:22.690 --> 42:26.664
I've got 52.5 miles per hour.

42:27.415 --> 42:31.631
You could drive faster than that.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.910
But it was entirely
made out of the leather.

42:33.911 --> 42:34.888
I think that's awesome.
That's right.

42:34.889 --> 42:35.617
It is awesome.

42:35.618 --> 42:38.350
The less than lethal velocity

42:38.351 --> 42:42.336
was caused by what is the final nail
in the leather cannon coffin.

42:44.524 --> 42:47.193
Deformation of the
combustion chamber

42:47.194 --> 42:50.398
and that can only mean one thing.

42:50.399 --> 42:53.159
It looked like it was
going to be plausible,

42:53.160 --> 42:55.799
but you can only get
one shot out of it,

42:55.800 --> 42:57.215
I think this one's busted.

42:57.216 --> 42:58.046
Busted.

42:58.047 --> 43:00.590
But man, what a way to go out.

43:00.591 --> 43:01.617
Looking cool.

43:01.618 --> 43:03.802
At least we got one
good shot out of it.

leather, it's good for

43:14.210 --> 43:16.065
not good for artilery.
