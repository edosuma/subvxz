00:01.920 --> 00:03.576
[Sheldon] <i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.600 --> 00:05.830
We conclusively proved super-asymmetry,

00:05.920 --> 00:08.799
and yet somehow we,
we still feel like impostors.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.360
There should be a term for that.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.274
Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

00:13.360 --> 00:16.592
It's called "imposter syndrome"
and you don't have it!

00:16.680 --> 00:20.196
Because you can't have it
if you are impostors, and you are!

00:20.280 --> 00:22.670
We're the ones
who discovered super-asymmetry!

00:22.760 --> 00:26.310
So if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome, it's us,

00:26.400 --> 00:28.960
because we're not impostors! They are!

00:29.040 --> 00:31.475
You're impostors and you're frauds!

00:38.040 --> 00:39.696
- Is that what I would've sounded like?
- Yeah.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.720
Yikes!

00:43.600 --> 00:44.829
Sheldon, look at this.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.559
Yeah. Wait a minute,

00:46.640 --> 00:48.711
how do I know this isn't one of those
joke phones

00:48.800 --> 00:50.917
that squirts water in my face?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.674
Because that's not even a thing. Look.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.958
[gasps] You got called
into Human Resources?

01:00.080 --> 01:02.240
I'm sure it's because I insulted
Pemberton and Campbell

01:02.320 --> 01:03.720
in a room full of Nobel Laureates.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.509
You did do that.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.956
It was awkward,
people didn't know where to look.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.317
This is a twist. Usually you're the one
getting called into HR.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.595
[Rajesh] Yeah, now it's Amy.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.951
Who knew you were married
to such a bad girl.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.192
I suppose the signs were always there.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.034
I mean, she did recently go to that rave
at the mall.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.157
- It was a Spencer's Gifts.
- Yeah...

01:26.200 --> 01:28.112
There was music and a strobe light.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.240
If that isn't a rave,
then I don't know what one is.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.312
You don't know what one is.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.000
Guys, come on, I think I'm in trouble.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.470
It's no big deal, I used to get called
into HR all the time.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.871
Ms. Davis is great. Pro tip,
if you find strong women sexy,

01:41.960 --> 01:43.758
do not say it out loud.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.236
[cell phone chimes]

01:48.480 --> 01:52.360
Oh! She wants to see me, too.
All right, let's get our story straight.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.840
This is all your fault.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.990
Relax, you're probably just gonna get
a slap on the wrist.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.640
Maybe, but do not ask for that.
On the wrist or anywhere else.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.351
<i>Our whole universe
was in a hot dense state</i>

02:04.440 --> 02:07.558
<i>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started...</i>

02:07.640 --> 02:08.471
<i>Wait!</i>

02:08.560 --> 02:09.471
<i>The earth began to cool</i>

02:09.560 --> 02:11.039
<i>The autotrophs began to drool</i>

02:11.120 --> 02:12.474
<i>Neanderthals developed tools</i>

02:12.560 --> 02:14.517
<i>We built a wall
We built the pyramids</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:17.274
<i>Math, science, history
Unraveling the mystery</i>

02:17.360 --> 02:19.317
<i>It all started with the Big Bang!</i>

02:19.400 --> 02:20.436
<i>Bang!</i>

02:27.440 --> 02:28.760
Thank you both for coming.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.878
President Siebert asked
that I be a part of this conversation

02:31.960 --> 02:34.794
to help us calmly discuss
what went wrong

02:34.880 --> 02:36.280
and how we can better move forward.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.113
We are not here to point fingers,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.871
so, Dr. Cooper, please stop that.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.789
President Siebert,
would you like to start?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.795
This is all my fault.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.920
I assumed you knew the Nobel Prize
was good and we wanted to win it.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.480
So that's on me.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.594
Oh. So...

02:59.680 --> 03:00.680
No.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.836
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say

03:04.920 --> 03:08.038
is that this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.032
Like, maybe you two
keep your traps shut.

03:10.120 --> 03:14.000
"Traps." That's a fun old word.
Where's that been?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.309
I'm sorry,

03:15.400 --> 03:17.073
I just, I snapped.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.550
Oh, you're sorry,
it's all better, then.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.958
Listen up, you have a shot to win
a Nobel Prize and you're blowing it.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.111
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is

03:26.200 --> 03:29.352
that you have a shot to win
a Nobel Prize and you're blowing it.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.597
That's exactly what he said.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.354
Yes, but I said it in
my calming HR voice.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.000
The science world is a small community,
people talk.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.198
I'm sure by now everyone knows
about your tantrum.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.351
All right, well, what can we do?

03:47.440 --> 03:51.036
Nothing. Let me make this absolutely
clear for you, you two are done talking.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.033
We're canceling your speaking
engagements and your interviews.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.158
You're going to lie low
and let us do damage control.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.119
Well, if that's what you want,
that's what we'll do.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.480
You two winning the Nobel Prize

04:01.560 --> 04:04.792
is very important to us.
And not just to the university.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.759
Dr. Fowler,
you would be only the fourth woman

04:07.840 --> 04:09.354
to win a Nobel Prize in physics.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.113
I don't need to tell you

04:11.200 --> 04:14.193
just how inspirational that would be
to a generation of young women.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.598
Yes! Of course, I know.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.951
So, the next words out of your mouth
should be on a stage in Stockholm

04:21.040 --> 04:23.350
when you're saying,
<i>"Tack fÃ¶r denna Ã¤ra,"</i>

04:23.440 --> 04:26.194
which is Swedish for,
"Thank you for this honor."

04:27.160 --> 04:30.312
<i>Jag visste det,</i> which is Swedish for
"I knew that."

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
Dr. Cooper?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.393
- You want me to shut my trap?
- I do.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.039
Hey, check it out, that looks like
the moped you used to have.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.952
Wasn't a moped. It was a scooter.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.077
- How's that better?
- [exclaims]

04:47.160 --> 04:49.834
You do not wanna walk into a scooter bar
and ask that question.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.590
Well, it does take me back.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.479
Yeah, the two of us cruising around town

04:56.560 --> 04:58.119
looking for women.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.715
Yeah, looking and looking and looking.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.870
Remember that time,
one looked back and said hi?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.792
Ah. Yeah.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.360
We drove away so fast.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.672
Hey, I forget,
why did you sell the scooter?

05:12.520 --> 05:13.920
I finally got my woman.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.110
[chuckles]

05:15.640 --> 05:16.840
Then my woman made me sell it.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.038
So apparently if we win,

05:22.120 --> 05:24.919
I'll be the fourth woman
ever to win a Nobel in physics.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.878
Wow. That's a big deal.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.960
Yeah. Tell me about it,

05:28.040 --> 05:30.760
this morning I blew through
my antiperspirant in like an hour.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.552
Plus, Sheldon's freaking out
'cause we got in trouble.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.200
Well, I got him distracted for a while.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.433
Wait, doesn't he know
how to solve those?

05:41.520 --> 05:45.230
Normally, yes, but I switched
the stickers around. So...

05:46.920 --> 05:48.560
I don't even think it's possible to so...

05:48.640 --> 05:49.640
Solved it!

05:51.600 --> 05:52.750
What? No, you didn't.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.470
Not the cube, but the puzzle
of why I couldn't solve the cube.

05:56.560 --> 06:01.510
Solution, you switched stickers two,
nine, 32 and 51.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.552
Really, this thing has numbers?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.757
Anything has a number
if you assign it a number,

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840
friend number four.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.829
Top five, not bad.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.479
Now this is so frustra...

06:12.600 --> 06:15.559
I can't believe the university expects
us to just sit back and do nothing.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.075
Sweetie, you just need to relax.
You know what I like to do?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.277
Numb your brain with alcohol
and watch a reality show

06:20.400 --> 06:22.640
where wealthy people pick fake arguments
with each other?

06:23.600 --> 06:27.480
Hey! Don't knock it until you've wasted
a couple hundred hours of your life.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.835
I'm sorry, but this is...
It's hard for me.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.071
Usually I self-soothe by doing science,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.720
but now science reminds me
of the Nobel Prize

06:35.800 --> 06:38.474
and the idea that we may not win one
and that makes me angry

06:38.560 --> 06:41.632
which makes me wanna self-soothe
by doing science and on and on and on.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.680
So that's been my today.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.310
Hey, how about a massage?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.437
No, the only person who touches me
is my wife.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.194
And even I have to let him
smell my hand first.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.793
Okay, well, what about Reiki?

06:58.880 --> 07:00.553
It's like massage but without touching.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.790
Then what is it?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.872
Well, I place my hands near your body

07:03.960 --> 07:07.636
and allow the universal energy field
to manifest its healing powers.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.480
Yeah, okay, I know it sounds crazy
but it really works, ask Leonard.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.789
- No... it really does.
- Yeah.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.880
[mouthing]

07:16.400 --> 07:20.394
Oh. How about
a sensory deprivation tank?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.790
Oh, that's interesting.
It's supposed to be very calming.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.709
Floating in a warm pool of liquid
in a dark, soundless space.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.514
I don't know how I feel
about being deprived of all my senses.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.954
What're you talking about?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.714
All you ever do is complain
about how things smell, feel and sound.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.032
Oh, I'm right here,
why are you shouting?

07:38.680 --> 07:39.750
What do you say?

07:39.840 --> 07:42.355
We could both use a break.
Come on, I'll do it with you.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.320
Okay, but not in the same tank.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.240
I already shared a uterus
with my twin sister,

07:46.360 --> 07:47.880
I don't need to go through that again.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.437
Are your eyes closed?

07:51.520 --> 07:52.556
Yes. What is it? Show me.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.790
Okay, open 'em.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.994
You bought me a scooter?

07:59.040 --> 08:01.032
No. I bought me a scooter.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
[Howard laughs]

08:02.400 --> 08:04.039
Then why'd you make me close my eyes?

08:04.120 --> 08:07.431
I wanted to see the expression on
your face when you saw how happy I was.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.111
Wait, one second.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.998
Won't Bernadette be mad
when she finds out?

08:12.080 --> 08:15.517
She's not gonna.
I'm keeping it here at the university.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.518
Ah. My dad kept a secret at work too,

08:17.640 --> 08:19.313
but it was his receptionist.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.879
Hey, would you mind
if I ride it sometimes?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.792
Yeah! Whenever you want.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.360
- [engine starting]
- [Howard exhales]

08:25.400 --> 08:26.231
Check it out.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.674
[engine revving]

08:27.760 --> 08:28.637
[chuckles]

08:28.720 --> 08:32.600
That there, son,
is twelve horses of Eye-talian thunder.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.720
[continues revving]

08:35.799 --> 08:38.599
Have either of you done
sensory deprivation before?

08:38.679 --> 08:40.477
- Never.
- No.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.234
Okay. Just a heads up,
people have different experiences

08:43.320 --> 08:44.150
in the tanks.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.436
Some people experience perfect calm.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.034
Some people sleep,

08:48.120 --> 08:49.720
some people even reported
having visions.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.832
But if at any time
you feel uncomfortable,

08:51.920 --> 08:54.116
just press the panic button and say,
"Bebe."

08:54.400 --> 08:56.960
[laughs] That's a stupid word.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.480
That's my name.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.272
What do we push
if we feel uncomfortable?

09:04.400 --> 09:05.436
All right, are you ready?

09:05.560 --> 09:07.153
I'm not saying this is why we came,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.833
but can I close the lid on him?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.029
No.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.515
No.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.677
Shall we?

09:16.760 --> 09:18.035
I... One second.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.356
Is the pH between 7.2 and 7.8?

09:20.440 --> 09:21.440
Yes.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.477
Is the water drained
and replaced after each use?

09:23.560 --> 09:24.471
Yes.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.233
- Is the saline level 30%?
- Yes.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.040
Does your filtration system use
ultraviolet light to kill bacteria?

09:29.120 --> 09:29.951
Yes.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.396
I don't need to get in,
I'm relaxed already.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.480
[Sheldon] Bebe.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.320
What's wrong?

09:46.800 --> 09:48.632
Nothing I just wanted to make sure
it worked.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.397
Also, I changed my mind,
it's fun to say your name.

09:52.480 --> 09:58.272
Bebe. Bebe. Bebe. Bebe. Bebe. Bebe.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.680
[Bernadette] Hey, whatcha got there?

10:05.520 --> 10:06.351
Oh.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.036
I... Just tossin' out this

10:10.120 --> 10:11.349
old helmet I don't need.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.639
I thought you were at the park.

10:15.760 --> 10:16.989
We were. The kids got sleepy.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.720
Great story.
I need to make a phone call.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.951
Howard, why do you look all guilty

10:22.040 --> 10:24.430
like when I catch you
deleting your browser history?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.040
[scooter approaching, horn honking]

10:34.320 --> 10:35.470
Never mind.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
[Sheldon] <i>Hmm.</i>

10:40.560 --> 10:41.994
<i>This is nice.</i>

10:42.120 --> 10:44.077
<i>Sort of like floating in space,</i>

10:44.160 --> 10:46.914
<i>but better because
my eyeballs haven't frozen.</i>

10:48.600 --> 10:50.273
<i>Ooh. Colors!</i>

10:51.600 --> 10:53.034
<i>It's infinite iterations of</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:55.589
<i>the "Nautilus" section
of the Mandelbrot set.</i>

10:56.960 --> 10:58.155
[Sheldon sighs]

10:59.000 --> 11:00.992
<i>That's some good stuff.</i>

11:04.600 --> 11:07.240
[Amy] <i>Wow, this is really dark.</i>

11:08.000 --> 11:11.630
<i>There's no difference
between my eyes being open or closed.</i>

11:11.760 --> 11:13.558
<i>Open. Closed.</i>

11:13.640 --> 11:16.030
<i>Open. Clo...
Nope, same thing.</i>

11:18.520 --> 11:20.193
<i>Ooh. Pretty!</i>

11:20.280 --> 11:24.035
You winning a Nobel Prize would
be an inspiration to all women.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.198
All women, Amy. And you're blowing it.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.393
I was gonna be a scientist,
but since you lost,

11:31.480 --> 11:33.995
I'm just gonna give
make-up tutorials on YouTube.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.115
[Sheldon] <i>Look at all the infinite
Mandelbrot sets.</i>

11:43.920 --> 11:46.230
<i>Here a brot, there a brot,
everywhere a Mandelbrot!</i>

11:50.480 --> 11:52.233
Thanks for letting us down.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.710
I'm gonna marry a dope
and have his dopey children.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.936
You're such a disappointment.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.155
I can't do science.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.560
Way to not go, girl.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.471
Disappointing.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.596
Math is too hard.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.478
I am woman, hear me bake.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.995
- Disappointing.
- You're letting us down.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.136
- Disappointing.
- You're blowing it.

12:06.160 --> 12:06.991
- Thanks for nothing.
- Disappointing. You're blowing it.

12:07.120 --> 12:07.917
You let me down.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.029
Okay, hour's up.
Let's see how they're doing.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.956
Hey, buddy, how ya feelin'?

12:18.040 --> 12:18.917
Aww!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.480
Five more minutes?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.120
Hey, Amy.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.230
Relaxed?

12:26.320 --> 12:27.879
I'm a failure!
I can't do this!

12:30.720 --> 12:33.360
Can somebody close her lid?
She's kind of harshing my mellow.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.232
That tank was amazing.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.118
Yeah, it was like Disneyland

12:44.240 --> 12:46.197
but the rides were
in 35 dimensions,

12:46.280 --> 12:48.272
and instead of Mickey,
I had my picture taken

12:48.360 --> 12:50.238
with the concept
that time is an illusion.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.393
That's great.
I'm so happy for you.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.959
Yeah, a little constructive criticism,

12:58.040 --> 13:00.400
you're saying you're happy
but you're using your mean voice.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.034
Thanks for pointing that out.

13:03.880 --> 13:04.916
Now you got it.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.113
Sheldon, I'm freaking out.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.311
Well, is this still about
the Nobel Prize?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.040
[yelling] Yes,
it's about the Nobel Prize.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.236
And back to the mean voice.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.600
It's just... It's too much pressure.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.149
You know, it was bad enough
when I was letting us down.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.153
But now if I don't win, it's like
I'm letting all women down!

13:23.280 --> 13:24.430
Hang on.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.840
What...
What're you doing?

13:25.920 --> 13:28.355
I'm googling what to do
when someone's freaking out.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.355
Huh. Oh, oh.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.154
It says here that a walk can be calming.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.110
Bye.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.316
Hey.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
You still mad?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.275
Are you still a jackass?

13:49.200 --> 13:50.759
Now, now, I asked you first.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.878
I can't believe you were sneaking around
my back like a child!

13:55.520 --> 13:57.273
I just didn't want you to worry.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.477
No, you just didn't wanna get caught.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.950
I'm sorry, but you telling me
what I can and can't do

14:02.040 --> 14:04.316
is pretty damn emasculating!

14:04.400 --> 14:05.800
Emasculating?

14:05.880 --> 14:08.634
You were about to ride bitch on a moped
with another man!

14:11.280 --> 14:12.475
It's a scooter.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.200
It can go on some highways.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.954
What if you fell?

14:19.040 --> 14:20.474
What if you got hurt?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.712
I don't wanna raise two small children
and one large vegetable!

14:25.360 --> 14:28.558
I'm sorry, but I need to have something
in my life that reminds me

14:28.680 --> 14:29.875
I'm still a man.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.397
You do! You have a wife,
and two children who need their father!

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
I know that.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.032
Well, you don't act like it.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.070
Why do you wanna ride
that stupid thing anyway?

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
I don't know.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.952
Maybe I just miss the freedom I had
as a younger man.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.874
What freedom? You lived
with your mother.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.360
You had a curfew!

14:55.120 --> 14:56.315
Wasn't a curfew.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.656
It was just a time of night
where if I got home after that,

14:58.680 --> 14:59.830
she would be mad.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.640
You know what, I'm done talking
about this.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.240
- Do whatever you want.
- Yeah, I will.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.560
I just want you to ask yourself
if that tiny, ridiculous scooter

15:07.640 --> 15:09.757
is the hill you wanna die on.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.390
[engine revving]

15:15.360 --> 15:16.953
Oh, yeah, this feels good.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.231
Born to ride, buddy.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.835
Yeah, watch out, ladies.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.234
All right, well, wish me luck.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.079
You won't need luck.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.680
- Yeah, only condoms.
- [Bert chuckles]

15:33.240 --> 15:34.515
He sees that car, right?

15:38.320 --> 15:41.313
I tried to console her,
but nothing seemed to work.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.359
Okay, when you say you consoled her,

15:44.440 --> 15:46.159
what exactly does that mean?

15:46.920 --> 15:49.355
[sighs] I took a walk, I came back,

15:49.440 --> 15:51.511
she was still upset, so I came here.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.072
Well, I don't see
what else you could've done.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.239
You know, I know she's unhappy
but I don't know how to help.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.640
Maybe you can't.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.792
Sometimes people are upset
and all you can do is be there for them.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.552
And while I'm there, what do I do?

16:09.960 --> 16:10.996
Nothing.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.471
Oh. So like what you're doing right now
to help me.

16:16.880 --> 16:17.920
You're up. [clears throat]

16:18.960 --> 16:22.954
Sheldon, maybe you don't know what to do
because Amy's always taking care of you.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.389
Of course.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.235
And by calming down I've taken away
the one thing that gives her comfort,

16:29.320 --> 16:30.595
caring for me.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.276
That's what you heard?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.236
Yes.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.676
Yeah, I need to have
an emotional meltdown

16:39.760 --> 16:42.673
so she's forced to focus on me
and forget about herself.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.720
No. That's not even close to what...

16:45.800 --> 16:47.960
You know, actually, that might
be your best move. Yeah.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.154
Amy, thank goodness you're home.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.910
I don't know if you can tell
but I am literally losing my mind.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
You are?

16:57.120 --> 16:59.874
Isn't it obvious?
I just used "literally" figuratively.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.796
Like a crazy person.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.233
What is going on with you? Are you okay?

17:06.319 --> 17:08.198
No, I'm not okay, so I suggest

17:08.280 --> 17:10.795
you start focusing on me
to the exclusion of your own feelings.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.433
Sheldon, whatever you're doing,
I don't have time for it right now.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.799
I'm sorry, I know you're upset,
but I don't know how to make it better.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.673
I don't know how you can, either.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.877
I don't know if anybody can. I just...

17:26.839 --> 17:29.355
I feel like I'm letting everybody down.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.475
I'm about to hold you,
would you like to smell my hand first?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.440
I'm fine.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.240
[Amy sighs]

17:55.360 --> 17:56.360
Thank you.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.075
[singing] <i>Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur</i>

18:05.160 --> 18:09.439
<i>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty
Purr, purr, purr</i>

18:10.680 --> 18:11.955
That helps.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.190
- Shh. I'm singing.
- Oh.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.390
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur...</i>

18:26.880 --> 18:28.917
Raj said you got $800.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.880
Jerk.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.960
On a positive note,
the scooter helped Bert meet a girl.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.353
Oh. That's nice. What does she do?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.874
She's an ER nurse.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.320
- No.
- No.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.754
It was a real meet-cute.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.718
She popped his arm back in the socket.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.591
And when he came to, they exchanged
phone numbers.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.916
Aww.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.520
[knocking on door]

18:57.800 --> 18:58.631
Ms. Davis?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.837
Dr. Fowler, how can I help you?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.676
You were right about this Nobel Prize
being bigger than I am.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.151
And you were right that, like it or not,
I am a role model.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.800
But you are wrong to keep me
on the sidelines.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.072
I am smart, I am capable
and I can make a difference.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.751
Well said. You make a strong case.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.550
Damn right, 'cause I'm a strong woman
wearing a strong man's deodorant.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.072
Well, how about have a seat?

19:26.160 --> 19:28.117
Maybe you'd like a glass of water?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.998
Do you have anything
with a little more kick?

19:31.320 --> 19:34.950
Seriously, Dr. Fowler,
this is Human Resources.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.997
You're right, I don't know
what I was thinking.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.839
You want ice, you're outta luck.
