WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.540
Catch all-new episodes Sundays
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.542 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.513
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
Only on Fox.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.520
(cackles)

00:23.957 --> 00:25.491
D'oh!

00:25.493 --> 00:26.492
(tires screeching)

00:26.494 --> 00:28.193
(grunts)

00:33.166 --> 00:35.701
(all groan)

00:43.209 --> 00:44.977
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Nocturnal cravings.</i>

00:44.979 --> 00:46.979
<i>A positive ultrasound.</i>

00:46.981 --> 00:50.783
<i>How could this woman's doctor</i>
<i>not know she was pregnant?</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:03.228
(gasps)
A baby.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.197
An astronaut baby.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.832
(baby laughs)

01:06.834 --> 01:10.335
Hey. Oh, have you ever
turned <i>on</i> a TV?

01:10.337 --> 01:13.338
It's my mother's
birthday.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.706
And you only turn 80 once.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.176
Or, in the case
of most people, no times.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.078
Now, put your good clothes on.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.581
I'm already in a dress and
pearls, and I'm eight years old.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.416
Can't we go
to her 81st birthday?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.185
That's the big one.

01:26.187 --> 01:30.522
Why does visiting my family
always have to be so hard?

01:30.524 --> 01:33.258
Because, face it, Marge,
your family doesn't like me.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.261
Never did, not even
when I had hair and a future

01:36.263 --> 01:38.097
and a bitchin' Pontiac GTO.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.531
Where is that
car, Homer?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.366
I went to a music festival,

01:41.368 --> 01:43.202
and I couldn't remember
where I parked it.

01:43.204 --> 01:47.973
(playing weakly):
♪ I'm a space cowboy.

01:50.043 --> 01:54.046
Homie, I feel about my family
like you felt about that car.

01:54.048 --> 01:56.448
No one loves a
person that much.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.450
Please go, for me?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.886
All right, but
remember the signal.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.722
If I tug my ear,
it's time for us to leave.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.124
I'm switching to my left ear

02:05.126 --> 02:07.025
because of what happened
last time.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.420
Uh-uh, no you don't.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.422
Your grandmother
knit this for you,

02:37.424 --> 02:39.491
so act like you wear
it all the time.

02:43.429 --> 02:45.497
(groans)

02:53.806 --> 02:55.774
She has a juice box.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.976
Why can't I have
a juice box?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.445
Because when she sticks
in the straw,

03:00.447 --> 03:03.015
she doesn't slip
and hit an artery.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.450
Oh, I'll never have juice.

03:05.452 --> 03:09.454
ALL:
♪ Happy birthday to you

03:09.456 --> 03:12.457
♪ Happy birthday, dear...

03:12.459 --> 03:14.459
♪ Mom
♪ Grandma

03:14.461 --> 03:15.827
♪ All of the above

03:15.829 --> 03:18.997
ALL:
♪ Happy birthday to you.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.799
Thank you.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.502
Jacqueline, I took the
money I usually give

03:23.504 --> 03:27.806
to con artists and preachers
and bought you these flowers.

03:27.808 --> 03:32.778
Oh, nothing tops
a simple romantic gesture.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.416
Except a rich man
flaunting his wealth.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.922
The one thing I can't beat--
competition.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.858
(knee pops loudly)

03:46.860 --> 03:49.328
Oh, Jacqueline, I
fell in love with you

03:49.330 --> 03:51.330
the moment I came
down with dementia.

03:51.332 --> 03:55.033
So to win your heart, I got you
an old-fashioned music player.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.336
Meh.
(groaning)

03:57.338 --> 03:58.704
Mr. Yo-Yo Ma.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.405
(gasps)

04:02.175 --> 04:03.542
No one said
there'd be music.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.011
There's always room
for cello.

04:06.013 --> 04:09.081
(plays Cello Suite
No. 1 by Bach)

04:11.384 --> 04:13.385
I know when I'm
licked, Burns.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.220
She's yours.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.588
Um, not interested.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.190
I just don't want
you to have her.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.026
Wow, that's the meanest thing
I ever heard,

04:21.028 --> 04:23.629
and I used to practice
cello on the subway.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.200
D'oh!
I'm next!

04:28.202 --> 04:29.568
Whee!

04:29.570 --> 04:31.370
(Bart and Lisa laugh)

04:31.372 --> 04:33.238
Hey, you two,
quit having fun.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.707
Trust me, nothing I've done
today has been fun.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.543
Hey, hey, the plastic's
here for a reason--

04:38.545 --> 04:39.911
to keep the couch clean.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.748
Watch and learn, boy.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.317
Voilà, now I take
a simple napkin and...

04:46.919 --> 04:47.919
(screams)

04:47.921 --> 04:49.621
(all groan)

04:49.623 --> 04:52.591
Who's ready to see some
slides of us as teenagers?

04:52.593 --> 04:54.226
(groaning)

04:54.228 --> 04:55.427
Here are the slides.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.929
Oh, just one box.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.765
Five terabytes.

04:59.767 --> 05:03.268
That's over 50,000 carousels
of family fun.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.337
(groans loudly)

05:07.940 --> 05:09.908
Here's us walking up the steps

05:09.910 --> 05:12.911
of Teotihuacán's
pyramid of the sun.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.415
Walking, walking,
stopping, walking.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.083
Walking, walking, walking.
(groans) Ooh.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.117
Hmm.
Stopping, stopping.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.420
Oh.
Walking, walking,

05:21.422 --> 05:23.755
walking, walking,
blister-popping.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.756
Huh?
Walking, walking.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.757
(groans)

05:25.759 --> 05:27.959
Stopping, walking,
walking...

05:27.961 --> 05:29.961
Oh, I sure miss Dad.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.964
We're here to watch
old photos, not reminisce.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.433
Walking, walking...

05:34.435 --> 05:35.801
How did Grampa Bouvier die?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.469
No one's ever told us.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.305
You know what, I
actually don't know.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.140
Me neither.
Not a clue.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.644
Girls, I'm afraid I didn't tell
any of you for a reason.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.646
(gasping)

05:47.648 --> 05:50.315
(plays dramatic tune)

05:50.317 --> 05:52.150
The real story,

05:52.152 --> 05:55.153
and it was something people were
ashamed to say at the time,

05:55.155 --> 05:57.489
is that he died of lung cancer.

05:57.491 --> 06:01.960
Mom, how could you know that
and still let us smoke?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.529
I thought it made you
look cool.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.634
Hey, Lis, do you think I can
climb walls like Spider-Man

06:09.636 --> 06:11.636
with denture cream
on my hands?

06:11.638 --> 06:13.472
(screams)
Nope.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.841
Next time, you should
wait for my answer.

06:15.843 --> 06:19.678
Knock it off! Your grandmother's
bathroom is not a toy chest.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.046
Ooh, Vicodin.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.482
I think it's time,
Selma dear.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.917
Time we quit smoking.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.562
Well, anyway,
happy birthday.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.373
(meows)

06:48.375 --> 06:51.376
Man, I can't believe your
sisters stopped smoking.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.545
I just hope
they don't put on weight.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.013
Hmm.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.381
You're so fat!

06:56.383 --> 06:58.850
(laughs)

06:58.852 --> 07:00.852
You're even fatter.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.220
Damn straight!

07:02.222 --> 07:04.289
No one out-fats me.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.731
Time for beddy-bye.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.566
Now, don't sleep
on your stomach.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.901
Or is it your back?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.569
Can never remember.

07:17.571 --> 07:21.306
Whichever is the comfortable
one, don't do that.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.811
(tapping)

07:27.547 --> 07:29.614
♪

07:57.743 --> 07:58.777
(chatters)

07:58.779 --> 08:00.278
(hoots)

08:00.280 --> 08:01.780
(hisses)

08:01.782 --> 08:03.615
(imitating Duffman):
Say hello to fun!

08:03.617 --> 08:05.083
Oh, yeah!

08:05.085 --> 08:06.251
Oh, no!

08:06.253 --> 08:07.486
Hoppy!

08:18.965 --> 08:22.000
In this house, Maggie is safe.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.869
(Maggie babbles playfully)

08:34.614 --> 08:36.381
(groans)

08:38.618 --> 08:43.455
Excuse me, I'd like a license
to operate heavy machinery.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.457
We don't do that here.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.460
Please? To me,
everything is heavy.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.295
(grunting):
No.
(groans)

08:50.297 --> 08:52.130
Patty, what
are you doing?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.132
Selma quit smoking, and
she's never been nicer.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.967
Here's your new license.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.337
Under "eyes,"
I put "red and dilated."

08:59.339 --> 09:01.172
Ooh, thank you, sir.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.175
Selma, not smoking
hasn't affected you at all.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.011
How is that possible?

09:06.013 --> 09:08.013
I even smell cigarette smoke
when it's not around.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.014
(sniffs)

09:09.016 --> 09:10.482
Like right now.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.317
Maybe you're having a stroke.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.653
Phantom smells <i>are</i> a symptom.

09:14.655 --> 09:19.491
Eh, what's the penalty for
driving a tractor drunk

09:19.493 --> 09:21.326
through a
Renaissance Faire?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.662
Can't help you--
I might be having a stroke.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.098
I have to consult a competent
medical professional.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.536
Got that.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.371
Got that.
(groans)

09:33.373 --> 09:35.206
Who doesn't have that?

09:35.208 --> 09:36.675
(groans)

09:36.677 --> 09:39.044
Anyone here to get
an ambulance license?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.178
That would be me.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.546
Here you go.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.614
I lied.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.617
(growls)

09:47.353 --> 09:48.720
Patty, all your
tests are positive.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.088
I mean, negative.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.189
Always get those
two confused.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.191
You're fine.
(chuckles)

09:53.193 --> 09:54.893
But I still smell smoke.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.728
(sniffs)
That's odd.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.729
So do I.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.064
Do you smell
anything, Selma?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.899
Hmm, uh-uh, nope.

10:00.901 --> 10:01.900
Wait a minute.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.301
Are you smoking?

10:08.541 --> 10:10.375
That's right, I am.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.211
I quit for only ten minutes
before I relapsed.

10:13.213 --> 10:17.582
And it was the best
cigarette of my life.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.885
(scoffs) I have never
been angrier at you.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.721
Me, too-- this
is a hospital.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.389
If you want to smoke,

10:24.391 --> 10:26.458
go do it in the stairwell
with the doctors.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.562
I'll miss you so much.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.930
Leave me Jub-Jub.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.465
Fine.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.471
At least you still smoke.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.275
I hate it when
you and Selma fight.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.578
Me, too. I also hate it
when they agree.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.113
Homer, please be nice.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.414
Patty's our guest.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.582
For how long?

10:50.584 --> 10:51.616
Where's she gonna sleep?

10:51.618 --> 10:52.917
On our couch.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.120
That's where we do
our couch gags!

10:55.122 --> 10:56.287
See?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.422
Oh, fine.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.690
She'll stay with the baby.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.593
Well, Magster,
it looks like

11:01.595 --> 11:04.663
you and I are going to be
cellmates. (chuckles)

11:06.098 --> 11:08.166
(buzzing)

11:10.002 --> 11:11.603
(screams)
Nature!

11:11.605 --> 11:12.971
Shoo! Shoo!

11:12.973 --> 11:14.439
I've got a hot
curling iron!

11:14.441 --> 11:16.508
Hold this.
(grunts)

11:20.112 --> 11:21.813
Oh, Marge,
the kids are all asleep

11:21.815 --> 11:23.448
and the dog's been walked.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.284
There's only
one thing left to do.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.786
(sexy purr)

11:27.788 --> 11:30.021
Did you turn the
security alarm on?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.123
It's still broken.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.460
Ooh, well, then
come here, you.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.995
(Patty snoring)

11:36.997 --> 11:38.663
(shouts)
What the hell was that?!

11:38.665 --> 11:40.331
It's just my sister snoring.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.634
She has a very fatty septum.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.470
But it doesn't have
to ruin our fun.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.138
(snoring continues)

11:47.140 --> 11:49.908
(both moaning)

11:51.310 --> 11:53.344
(gasps, coughs)

11:53.346 --> 11:56.081
(owl hooting)

12:05.157 --> 12:07.592
(snoring)
(music playing intermittently)

12:24.677 --> 12:27.846
Okay, which one of you kids
knows how to drive?

12:27.848 --> 12:30.548
And which is sober?

12:30.550 --> 12:33.518
Whew, thank God
for Designated Dorothy.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.120
(engine starts, truck backfires)

12:45.564 --> 12:47.699
All right, everybody
go to bed.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.901
Those of you who got
to get up early,

12:49.903 --> 12:52.036
sleep on top of the pile.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.405
Hey, Brandine!

12:54.407 --> 12:56.040
I caught us a possum!

12:56.042 --> 12:57.876
You want to name it

12:57.878 --> 12:59.911
before we eat it
or after?

12:59.913 --> 13:00.912
During!

13:00.914 --> 13:03.581
Beauregard,
you've been promoted

13:03.583 --> 13:06.651
from guarding my family
to guarding this possum.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.020
That's a good dog.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.063
Hmm.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.732
Hey, baby.

13:20.734 --> 13:24.235
How about that rain check
for last night?

13:24.237 --> 13:25.436
PATTY:
Aah!
Aah!

13:25.438 --> 13:26.938
Aah, don't look at me!

13:26.940 --> 13:29.407
But you're everywhere!
(gasping)
Freak!

13:29.409 --> 13:30.942
(shouts)
Don't you ever knock?

13:30.944 --> 13:32.777
(groans)
Get out of
here! Go away!

13:32.779 --> 13:35.146
(sighs) Thank God I'm blind.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.748
Yo, I'm next.

13:36.750 --> 13:37.916
No!

13:37.918 --> 13:39.751
Whoa! What the hell?

13:39.753 --> 13:41.452
I did that
with love, boy.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.921
What's all the hubbub?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.756
Oh, thank you, Dad.
It's okay, son.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.791
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's okay, it's okay.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.093
No, really, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

13:49.095 --> 13:50.962
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.263
All right, already!

13:52.265 --> 13:54.165
Just take a shower.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.969
I need someone to talk to.

13:57.971 --> 14:01.372
Thank God I've got a past
full of lonely men to draw from.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.975
Mm-hmm.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.177
Disco Stu is over you.

14:08.113 --> 14:12.150
Oh, Disco Stu
needs a Zoloft or two.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.785
(grunts)

14:13.787 --> 14:15.286
Who am I kidding?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.288
The one I should be talking to

14:17.290 --> 14:19.657
is the one who's always
been there for me...

14:19.659 --> 14:21.459
my cigarette.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.827
Forget about your sister.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.462
You've got me.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.331
For the rest of your life,
I'll be the first thing

14:26.333 --> 14:28.166
you think about every morning.

14:28.168 --> 14:33.304
And the last thing you do
every night.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.174
Hmm, looks like I have
a choice to make.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.976
(grunting)
Oh!

14:37.978 --> 14:41.079
I'm in your hair!
(laughs)

14:45.017 --> 14:47.018
Uh...
(clears throat)

14:47.020 --> 14:49.854
Listen, about this morning,

14:49.856 --> 14:52.690
I'm sorry I walked in on you!

14:52.692 --> 14:54.692
(grumbling)

14:54.694 --> 14:56.861
Oh! Oh, yeah.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.496
I'm about to
say something

14:58.498 --> 15:01.232
I never thought I'd say
to you-- something nice.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.667
Hmm?
(sighs)

15:02.669 --> 15:05.670
I only mock you
because I'm jealous

15:05.672 --> 15:07.672
of what Marge
has in you.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.674
I only have Selma.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.677
And now I don't
even have that.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.379
(sighs)

15:14.381 --> 15:16.714
Oh, Patty,
I've waited so long

15:16.716 --> 15:19.017
for you to open
a window of niceness.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.184
(grunts)
That was it!

15:20.186 --> 15:21.219
Window shut!

15:21.221 --> 15:22.921

15:24.189 --> 15:25.924
Ah, what the heck!

15:26.892 --> 15:29.027
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

15:29.029 --> 15:31.529
Aah... (sighs)

15:31.531 --> 15:33.231
What are you doing here?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.366
Apologizing.

15:35.368 --> 15:39.370
And I want you to know
I quit smoking for good.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.239
You quit for me?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.740
I quit for us.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.043
Hmm, that's actually
more selfish,

15:45.045 --> 15:47.211
but it sounds really nice.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.780
(both grunting)

15:48.782 --> 15:50.415
Okay, Maggie,
throw the ball to me.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.616
Throw the ball.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.720
Okay, how about
I throw the ball?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.555
It's okay.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.792

you back, Patty.

regretted 'cause you were gone.
