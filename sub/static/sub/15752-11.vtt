00:07.267 --> 00:08.633
(man)
* I feel all right

00:08.633 --> 00:10.000
* Just like I should,
should, should *

00:10.000 --> 00:12.267
That's the watch
I'm gonna buy Thad.

00:12.267 --> 00:13.367
It's exactly what he wants.

00:13.367 --> 00:14.567
This feels like
a guilt gift.

00:14.567 --> 00:15.767
You might as well get it
engraved

00:15.767 --> 00:17.567
with a sketch
of Bjornberg's penis.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.100
Thad never found out
about Bjornberg,

00:20.100 --> 00:21.833
and there's certainly no point
in telling him now.

00:21.833 --> 00:23.400
I mean, why would I want
to hurt him like that?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.033
I don't know,

00:25.033 --> 00:27.667
that thing about how honesty in
a relationship creates intimacy?

00:27.667 --> 00:30.200
One woman's honesty
is another woman's over sharing.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.500
Fine.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.167
I'm just saying
expensive jewelry

00:33.167 --> 00:34.767
doesn't excuse an affair.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.733
And in the end, after all
the tears and the fights,

00:36.733 --> 00:38.067
you know what you're left with?

00:38.067 --> 00:39.267
Bad credit
and a piece of jewelry

00:39.267 --> 00:40.433
with almost no resale value

00:40.433 --> 00:42.233
that reminds you
of someone you hate.

00:42.233 --> 00:43.333
[phone buzzes]

00:43.333 --> 00:44.533
(Lauren)
Where are you skanks?

00:44.533 --> 00:45.733
We're on our way, you ho.

00:45.733 --> 00:47.333
Why do you talk
to each other like that?

00:47.333 --> 00:48.667
[scoffs]
Is that Liza?

00:48.667 --> 00:49.900
Uh, yeah.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.533
Okay, tell that hooker
to stop talking

00:51.533 --> 00:53.033
and start walking.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.600
Okay.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.533
Slut-bag.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.433
(Lauren)
[squeals] Finally.
Sit.

01:00.433 --> 01:02.133
I ordered you bibimbap.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.733
- Mm, yes.
- Oh, God, what's bibimbap?

01:03.733 --> 01:05.833
Oh, it's Korean.
You're gonna love it.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.567
Yeah, it's the
second best Korean thing

01:07.567 --> 01:09.067
I've ever had in my mouth.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.533
Hey, so I've been trying
to send you an invite,

01:10.533 --> 01:11.667
and it keeps bouncing back,

01:11.667 --> 01:13.067
so I Googled you,
and nothing.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.100
Liza, you're like a ghost
on the Internet.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.600
Oh, yeah, um,

01:16.600 --> 01:18.500
I like to--
I like to keep a low profile.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.700
Uh, a low profile?

01:19.700 --> 01:21.400
Yeah, never say that
to a publicist.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.633
- No.
- What's the invite?

01:22.633 --> 01:24.133
I'm having a Hot Mitzvah.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.767
- A what?
- Just watch.

01:28.633 --> 01:31.200
(Lauren)
At my Bat Mitzvah,
I hated how I looked.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.533
That's why 13 years later,

01:33.533 --> 01:36.067
I am throwing a Hot Mitzvah.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.567
[laughs]

01:37.567 --> 01:40.633
(Lauren)
You're invited,
so you must be hot.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.100
Is that a Star of David
bikini top?

01:42.100 --> 01:43.267
Yes!

01:43.267 --> 01:44.367
I crocheted it out
of two yarmulkes.

01:44.367 --> 01:45.500
Chic.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.800
Bring Josh
and Craigslist Maggie.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
Tell that OWL
I want her to come.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.667
Owl?

01:49.667 --> 01:51.200
Older wise lesbian.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.300
Hoot hoosh.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.300
[woman vocalizing,
upbeat music]

01:56.300 --> 02:00.067
*

02:00.067 --> 02:01.567
New Tricks.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.467
As you can see, we're ready.
We've got the stand-ups,

02:03.467 --> 02:04.733
the wall hangers,
the Amazon Banner,

02:04.733 --> 02:06.200
the Kindle banner,
the NOOK banner.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.833
Liza?

02:07.833 --> 02:10.067
Social media is hyped
from Facebook to Book Riot--

02:10.067 --> 02:11.167
Goodreads, too.

02:11.167 --> 02:14.200
So my department is ready to go.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.067
All we need now is the book.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.533
Kelsey.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.500
Well, the good news is the draft
is finally in.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.600
The bad news is
it's a mess.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.867
She uses the word "man root"
12 times in one chapter.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.800
So I'm out to
all the top book doctors,

02:27.800 --> 02:29.833
and I'm just trying to figure
out who's the best fit.

02:29.833 --> 02:31.333
Well, I suggest
you pick one soon,

02:31.333 --> 02:32.600
or we'll have to push
the pub date.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.167
No, that won't happen.

02:35.167 --> 02:36.700
Good.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.733
Then I think we're done.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.067
Hey, I'm doing a coffee run.
You need anything?

02:47.067 --> 02:50.867
Yeah, a book doctor
for Megyn Vernoff.

02:50.867 --> 02:52.533
Half of my regulars
are busy competing

02:52.533 --> 02:54.100
for the Kardashian rewrite.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.167
Where do you even find
a book doctor, anyway?

02:56.167 --> 02:58.700
Most of them are stay-at-home
moms with Ivy League degrees.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.400
I mean, some of them
had really promising careers.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.067
They just gave up to have kids,

03:03.067 --> 03:05.500
and now they're so far
off track, they do anything.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.067
They don't even care
about the credit.

03:07.067 --> 03:10.067
Another reason why
we can never stop working.

03:10.067 --> 03:12.067
You know, I've done
some creative writing.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.133
And I edited
the Dartmouth literary journal.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.967
Maybe I could give
the Vernoff book a try.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.567
Seriously?

03:18.567 --> 03:21.800
You want to write about the sex
life of a woman in her 40s?

03:21.800 --> 03:23.567
I'm sure I can suppress
my gag reflex

03:23.567 --> 03:25.567
if I'm getting paid enough.

03:25.567 --> 03:26.833
That came out wrong.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.233
But I could use the money.

03:28.233 --> 03:29.733
Well, that's a good reason.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.800
See what you can do
with chapter one.

03:39.867 --> 03:43.067
How did I miss the memo
on book doctors?

03:43.067 --> 03:44.700
I could have been doing this
for years.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.700
Well, there was, like,
an entire decade

03:46.700 --> 03:48.533
where you were in a PTA fugue.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.067
[cell phone chimes]

03:51.067 --> 03:52.200
(Maggie)
Josh?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.933
Yeah, but I'm not
getting distracted.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.400
This is a big opportunity
for me.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.667
Oh, really?
What's the book?

03:57.667 --> 03:59.433
It's called New Tricks.

03:59.433 --> 04:02.367
And it's about a woman's sexual
reawakening in her 40s.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.467
So you're a 40-year-old
pretending to be a 26-year-old

04:04.467 --> 04:06.767
who's pretending to write
in the voice of a 40-year-old?

04:06.767 --> 04:09.533
Stop it.
My head's exploding.

04:09.533 --> 04:11.633
(woman)
* You don't get me *

04:11.633 --> 04:13.967
* You don't understand my way *

04:13.967 --> 04:16.533
* It's too foreign *

04:16.533 --> 04:19.466
* I don't mind *

04:19.466 --> 04:21.899
* Same as any other day

04:21.899 --> 04:24.167
* Hey

04:24.167 --> 04:25.367
* Hey

04:25.367 --> 04:31.867
*

04:31.867 --> 04:34.267
* You don't see me *

04:34.267 --> 04:36.867
* No, you look right through
my face *

04:36.867 --> 04:39.467
* And when we're talkin' *

04:39.467 --> 04:41.867
* I don't mind *

04:41.867 --> 04:44.467
* 'Cause I'm in another place *

04:44.467 --> 04:46.067
* Hey

04:46.067 --> 04:49.967
* What you gonna do
when you get lonely? *

04:49.967 --> 04:54.833
* What you gonna make
in outer space? *

04:54.833 --> 04:58.500
* When the air's not clear
to see the only thing *

04:58.500 --> 05:01.067
* The insight gravity
can bring *

05:01.067 --> 05:04.300
* Is knowing what you needed
all along *

05:04.300 --> 05:05.800
* Was a little love

05:05.800 --> 05:07.600
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.433
You're getting your own coffee?

05:09.433 --> 05:11.133
I like to keep
my life skills sharp.

05:11.133 --> 05:15.567
You know, in case
there's another Sandy.

05:15.567 --> 05:16.767
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:16.767 --> 05:18.967
Hey, I sent you that chapter.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.233
I know.
I read it.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.767
And?

05:22.767 --> 05:24.933
You nailed it.

05:24.933 --> 05:25.933
Really?

05:25.933 --> 05:27.600
Yes.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.300
That whole passage where she's
trying to hide her stretch marks

05:30.300 --> 05:31.533
from her boyfriend,

05:31.533 --> 05:32.833
you must have done
your research.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.900
Yeah, it's just
a writerly imagination.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.833
And is it true that older women
really pee a little

05:37.833 --> 05:38.967
every time they sneeze?

05:38.967 --> 05:40.733
Once you've shot a baby out--

05:40.733 --> 05:42.200
at least,
that's what I hear.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.433
[scoffs]

05:43.433 --> 05:44.867
Well, I've got to tell you,
Liza,

05:44.867 --> 05:46.800
I've hired a lot
of book doctors,

05:46.800 --> 05:48.300
you're good at it.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.333
You really liked it?

05:49.333 --> 05:50.700
Yes.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.600
And that's why
I gave it to Charles.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
Seriously?

05:53.600 --> 05:54.867
Yes.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.567
And you are
seriously welcome.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.700
(Charles)
Liza.

06:01.700 --> 06:02.967
Oh, hi.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.833
I just read your chapter.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.600
That's good.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.200
Your HR file
says you're 26,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.767
but you write like
a 40-year-old.

06:12.767 --> 06:15.133
There's something
you want to tell me?

06:15.133 --> 06:17.300
Uh...

06:17.300 --> 06:18.333
No.

06:20.867 --> 06:22.100
Come see me
in my office.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:31.700 --> 06:33.700
Liza, all this time,
I thought you were

06:33.700 --> 06:35.200
just another
struggling assistant.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.100
But you've had a secret
all along, haven't you?

06:41.633 --> 06:43.933
Well, um...

06:43.933 --> 06:46.067
And now I think I know
your secret.

06:48.733 --> 06:51.567
You're a writer.

06:51.567 --> 06:53.767
Yeah.
I'm a writer.

06:53.767 --> 06:55.100
Just--I'm a writer.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.967
Guilty.
Throw the book at me.

06:56.967 --> 06:59.067
Terrible pun.
I apologize.

06:59.067 --> 07:01.200
Your chapter sample
was so impressive.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.467
Obviously, you're good enough
to rewrite Megyn Vernoff.

07:03.467 --> 07:04.467
Really?

07:04.467 --> 07:05.900
Thank you.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.200
But book doctoring
isn't really about writing.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.100
It isn't?

07:09.100 --> 07:11.333
No, it's more about egos

07:11.333 --> 07:16.067
and that elusive thing
that they call "chemistry."

07:16.067 --> 07:17.567
Oh.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.400
Which I think
you will excel at.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.500
Oh, good.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.067
You are an easy person
to meet,

07:23.067 --> 07:24.233
to work with,

07:24.233 --> 07:26.700
to, um...

07:26.700 --> 07:29.600
be with.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.500
At least, I think so.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.833
Thank you.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.267
I will set up
a meeting for you and Megyn.

07:35.267 --> 07:36.500
If the two of you click,

07:36.500 --> 07:37.667
the rewrite's yours.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.600
What were you doing
in Charles' office?

07:45.600 --> 07:47.100
Uh.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.767
Honestly,

07:48.767 --> 07:50.133
I was throwing
my hat in the ring

07:50.133 --> 07:52.300
for that Megyn Vernoff
book doctoring gig

07:52.300 --> 07:54.167
as a side thing.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.767
I was very ambitious
at your age too.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.067
But a word to the wise.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.233
Climbing too quickly
is dangerous.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.400
You might find you don't
have the right equipment

08:05.400 --> 08:06.800
at altitude,

08:06.800 --> 08:09.167
and your friends
won't be there to help you.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.400
(Josh)
Here's to your first
professional writing assignment.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.533
I've got to admit,
I'm pretty excited.

08:26.533 --> 08:28.933
So what's it about?

08:28.933 --> 08:30.567
It's about this woman

08:30.567 --> 08:33.332
who's been sexually shut down

08:33.332 --> 08:35.267
'cause she's been
in a dead marriage.

08:35.267 --> 08:39.067
And she has
this kind of awakening.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.433
What awakens her?

08:40.433 --> 08:43.067
She has an affair
with her son's karate teacher.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.733
[gasps]

08:44.733 --> 08:46.067
[laughs]

08:46.067 --> 08:48.067
And how exactly
does he awaken her?

08:48.067 --> 08:51.433
- You want me to tell you?
- Yeah.

08:51.433 --> 08:52.400
Okay.

08:56.467 --> 08:58.433
When he first kisses her,

08:58.433 --> 09:01.400
he kisses her very, very softly.

09:05.733 --> 09:08.500
Not like it's a bore,

09:08.500 --> 09:09.867
more like she's a dessert,

09:09.867 --> 09:12.967
and he wants to savor
every mouthful of her.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.267
Then what happens?

09:14.267 --> 09:19.500
Then he lays her down
on his bed

09:19.500 --> 09:21.833
and tells her not to move.

09:21.833 --> 09:24.967
She has to stay
absolutely still

09:24.967 --> 09:28.167
while he kisses
every centimeter of her body

09:28.167 --> 09:32.867
from the top of her head
to the tips of her toes.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.533
Do they ever take a bath?

09:37.533 --> 09:38.733
They could.

09:38.733 --> 09:40.900
I could write
that passage.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.267
What'd happen?

09:42.267 --> 09:43.667
Mm.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.100
Maybe she would look
at his body

09:46.100 --> 09:47.400
in the glistening water,

09:47.400 --> 09:51.200
and the water would be
warm and slippery.

09:51.200 --> 09:55.833
And then maybe
she would take his...

09:55.833 --> 09:56.833
[door clicks open]

09:56.833 --> 09:58.433
(man)
Sorry, guys.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.800
I think I left my--yeah,
here's my phone right here.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.333
Uh, hi, Liza.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.767
Yeah, I found it.
I didn't see anything.

10:04.767 --> 10:05.767
I hate him.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.400
[laughs]

10:07.400 --> 10:09.233
(woman)
* Together, we can change
the world *

10:09.233 --> 10:10.867
(woman)
* Change the world

10:10.867 --> 10:12.500
* Together,
we can change the world *

10:12.500 --> 10:14.700
Simon, you're not riding your
bike alone to Queens.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.700
Do you hear me?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.333
Why?

10:17.333 --> 10:20.767
Because you are 11 and white
enough to be thrown into a van.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.267
This is end of story.

10:22.267 --> 10:23.733
I am hanging up.

10:23.733 --> 10:25.000
I'm hanging up.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.667
I'm han--

10:27.667 --> 10:28.667
Little shit.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.100
Are you Liza?

10:30.100 --> 10:31.367
Yes, Megyn, hi.
It's so nice to meet you.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.700
What'd you hate
about my book?

10:33.700 --> 10:37.033
Oh, no.
I didn't hate anything.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.533
I just think there
could be more of everything.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.033
Like what?
More what?

10:41.033 --> 10:43.633
Um, okay, for example,

10:43.633 --> 10:46.333
when Mindy first has sex
with Joey,

10:46.333 --> 10:50.867
"he bangs her hard in the dark
closet behind the dojo."

10:50.867 --> 10:52.267
Mm-hmm, right.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.333
Maybe that could be
a little more romantic.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.267
Like, how?

10:56.267 --> 10:58.633
Maybe they could
actually see each other.

10:58.633 --> 10:59.700
Right.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.233
Once you've had three kids,

11:01.233 --> 11:03.233
your stomach's like
a deflated basketball.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.500
So mm-mm.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.933
[scoffs]

11:05.933 --> 11:08.067
Everything on this menu
is kale.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.067
Maybe Joey doesn't mind
Mindy's flaws.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.600
Maybe they're impressive,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.433
like battle scars.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.467
Are you serious?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.333
How old are you?

11:18.333 --> 11:19.600
26, 27?

11:19.600 --> 11:20.967
Around there.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.833
Well, most of my readers
are over 40,

11:22.833 --> 11:25.533
and, believe me,
the whole game changes.

11:25.533 --> 11:26.933
You have no idea

11:26.933 --> 11:28.500
what it's like
after you have kids.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.433
I can imagine.

11:30.433 --> 11:31.467
Oh, yeah?

11:31.467 --> 11:34.233
What can you imagine?

11:34.233 --> 11:37.333
I imagine that giving birth
doesn't feel like a miracle.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.267
It feels more like--like
you've been in a car accident.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.900
Your whole body hurts
for weeks.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.233
And then you start nursing,

11:43.233 --> 11:45.500
and you feel like
a dairy production animal,

11:45.500 --> 11:46.500
especially if you pump.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.133
And you're so tired,

11:48.133 --> 11:49.867
and you get these little white
bumps on the back of your arms,

11:49.867 --> 11:51.167
and every shirt you own
is stained,

11:51.167 --> 11:52.600
and your husband looks
at you like,

11:52.600 --> 11:54.067
"Oh, my God,
what happened?"

11:54.067 --> 11:55.600
And the last thing you can think
about is having sex.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.133
It's like you're never going
to find

11:57.133 --> 11:58.467
that part of yourself again.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.400
Okay, keep going.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.867
Okay.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.367
Pinot Grigio.

12:16.367 --> 12:21.133
(man)
* She got it now

12:21.133 --> 12:22.900
* She got it now, now

12:22.900 --> 12:24.767
* She got it now

12:24.767 --> 12:25.800
She hated you.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.600
What?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.867
Yeah, it's that chemistry thing,
so don't take it personally.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.067
I really thought we connected.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.500
Maybe you did.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.467
But she didn't feel like
you could realistically

12:34.467 --> 12:37.167
get into the head
of a woman in her 40s.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.333
What are you gonna do?

12:38.333 --> 12:40.433
You're--
you're just too young.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.367
[sighs]

12:46.367 --> 12:48.467
(Diana)
It was so nice to meet you,
Hayley.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.767
(Hayley)
Diana, thank you so much
for your time.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.100
I will hold on
to your resume.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.900
Oh, that's a friend of mine's
daughter.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.900
She just graduated
from Harvard.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.600
There are so many of you
out there.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.733
The thing that
we love most about our Laura

13:14.733 --> 13:15.933
is that she never gives up.

13:15.933 --> 13:17.333
- No, no, never.
- Never.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.900
She is the master of the encore.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.133
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.500
Her second try
at the SATs...

13:21.500 --> 13:23.733
Second time
she went to college.

13:23.733 --> 13:24.900
Her second nose job.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.267
[laughs]

13:26.267 --> 13:27.633
Well, no, as plain as the nose
on her face.

13:27.633 --> 13:28.633
What we're saying--

13:28.633 --> 13:30.367
So I don't see a watch on Thad.

13:30.367 --> 13:31.967
I know.
I thought about what you said.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.267
And, um, you're right.
It's a dead giveaway.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.100
We'd now like to bring to Bima

13:37.100 --> 13:38.800
the star in all of our lives,

13:38.800 --> 13:43.800
our daughter, the beautiful
Lauren Tovah Heller.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.733
[cheers and applause]

13:48.633 --> 13:49.933
(man)
We're so proud of you.

13:49.933 --> 13:52.733
Who's ready to worship?

13:52.733 --> 13:55.400
Uh, my Torah portion today
tells the story

13:55.400 --> 13:58.300
of Jacob,
son of Isaac and Rebecca.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.067
Jacob lied to his father,

14:01.067 --> 14:02.633
pretending to be his brother

14:02.633 --> 14:05.400
in order to unfairly win
their father's blessing.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.067
Wait, that's in the Torah?

14:07.067 --> 14:10.067
I could have sworn that's
an episode of Game of Thrones.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.300
Today,

14:12.300 --> 14:14.733
I am the older,
serving my younger self,

14:14.733 --> 14:16.667
bearing my honest feelings
with all of you.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.067
Because being honest
with the people we love

14:19.067 --> 14:21.900
is what today
is really all about.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.633
Yes, at my first Bat Mitzvah,

14:24.633 --> 14:26.733
I didn't have the nerve to kiss
the person that I wanted.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.600
But tonight, I'm hot,
and I'm kissing who I want.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.800
Shabbat shalom!

14:30.800 --> 14:32.300
- Shabbat shalom.
- Shabbat shalom.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.767
(man)
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up?

14:33.767 --> 14:37.700
I'm K-Run
AKA "Your mama's sperm bank."

14:37.700 --> 14:41.633
And I'm your emcee/panty-dropper
for the night.

14:41.633 --> 14:42.700
Uh, yeah.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.067
* I'm adoring Lauren Heller *

14:44.067 --> 14:45.433
* She's hella hot *

14:45.433 --> 14:47.733
* But at 13,
she was most def not *

14:47.733 --> 14:50.400
* Skinny with pimples,
getting dissed by the cutie *

14:50.400 --> 14:53.067
* Now look who's got a good job
and a small booty *

14:53.067 --> 14:55.667
* Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh

14:55.667 --> 14:56.867
* Uh

14:56.867 --> 15:00.067
*

15:00.067 --> 15:01.467
* Uh-huh, uh-huh

15:01.467 --> 15:04.200
* Come on, let's see it,
Ken and Barbie *

15:06.167 --> 15:07.467
Not gonna happen, bro.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.400
Oh, something's gonna happen,
huh?

15:09.400 --> 15:12.267
Come on.
A little robot, huh?

15:12.267 --> 15:13.867
Come on, girl.

15:13.867 --> 15:16.633
Huh, what?
Come on. Show me some love.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.800
(Lauren)
Okay, you two.
Come with me, you two.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.300
- Now what?
- It's going to be fine.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.600
Liza, Josh, hi.
Your presence is required.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.867
Come.
Come this way.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.333
- Maggie.
- Hi.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.367
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:29.367 --> 15:30.867
- Come with me.
- Okay.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.667
Please arrange yourselves.

15:37.567 --> 15:42.167
Okay, since you are
all my closest friends,

15:42.167 --> 15:43.600
I wanted to make
a special toast.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.300
Thank you for coming tonight.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.967
I know that I can be kind
of out there sometimes,

15:46.967 --> 15:49.133
but all of you guys accept me
and support me,

15:49.133 --> 15:51.867
and that just--
it means everything.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.167
To my friends.

15:53.167 --> 15:55.067
L'chaim, bitches!

15:55.067 --> 15:58.067
[all cheer]

15:58.067 --> 16:00.267
(woman)
[auto-tuned] * So high

16:00.267 --> 16:05.467
* I'm--I'm--I'm so high *

16:05.467 --> 16:07.233
Oh, my God.
This is horrible.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.600
What is that?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.500
That's my special Hot Mitzvah
shooter,

16:10.500 --> 16:11.833
Manischewitz and Molly.

16:11.833 --> 16:12.833
What?

16:12.833 --> 16:14.200
You are crazy.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.900
Oh, we are so not golfing
with your parents tomorrow.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.700
What are they talking about?
What's Molly?

16:18.700 --> 16:21.067
MDMA.
Pure Ecstasy.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.367
What?

16:22.367 --> 16:26.067
Best Hot Mitzvah ever!

16:26.067 --> 16:27.967
Whoo!

16:31.533 --> 16:33.700
(man)
* She like it,
she know that *

16:33.700 --> 16:35.067
* She like it

16:35.067 --> 16:37.067
How do you know
if you're rolling?

16:37.067 --> 16:38.267
How are you feeling?

16:38.267 --> 16:41.933
Like every hair on my body
is happy.

16:41.933 --> 16:45.733
And I'm wrapped in a warm
blanket of music.

16:45.733 --> 16:47.933
You're definitely rolling.

16:47.933 --> 16:49.233
Hey, you guys want
some water?

16:49.233 --> 16:52.167
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Oh, God.

16:52.167 --> 16:53.167
Oh, God.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.133
Okay.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.567
[distorted]
Thank you.

16:55.567 --> 16:56.767
You look wonderful.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.167
[laughs]

16:58.167 --> 17:00.900
I'm gonna start wearing,
like, big gold belts.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.300
That is, like,
the best you have ever had.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.200
I thought I could never be
with you.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.567
We should just, like,
talk all night.

17:07.567 --> 17:08.833
Yes.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.166
There.
There. I did it.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.400
I finally got to kiss
the person I wanted to.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.400
[giggles]
Okay.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.933
Uh, yeah.

17:24.933 --> 17:27.666
Uh, I-I-I'll talk to you.

17:27.666 --> 17:28.733
Definitely.

17:28.733 --> 17:31.967
Wow.

17:31.967 --> 17:36.967
(woman)
* Oh, he's so enticed
by the way I'm moving *

17:36.967 --> 17:38.200
I don't say this enough,

17:38.200 --> 17:40.233
but you're the best boyfriend.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.833
You're the best girlfriend.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.067
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.700
That's why I got you this.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.867
What?

17:46.867 --> 17:48.433
Yeah, I was gonna give it
to you later,

17:48.433 --> 17:49.533
but I can't wait.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.067
Oh, my God.

17:51.067 --> 17:54.267
It's the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.267
Yeah?

17:55.267 --> 17:56.333
[gasps]

17:56.333 --> 17:59.633
Yeah.

17:59.633 --> 18:01.867
Wait a minute.

18:01.867 --> 18:04.300
You're not giving me
this for no reason.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.600
[sighs]

18:06.600 --> 18:07.933
Babe--

18:07.933 --> 18:11.133
You're, like--
it's like--

18:11.133 --> 18:13.800
Um, I went to a strip club
with some of the guys from work.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.867
And I got a lap dance
and went a little too far.

[laughs]

18:26.300 --> 18:27.400
You know what,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.800
I bought you a watch,

18:29.800 --> 18:32.467
a really expensive watch.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.300
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

18:34.300 --> 18:38.700
I'm saying, I think it would
a lot cheaper for both of us

18:38.700 --> 18:41.333
if we were just monogamous.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.367
All right.

18:42.367 --> 18:43.667
We have a deal?

18:43.667 --> 18:44.867
Yes.

18:44.867 --> 18:45.933
- [laughs]
- We have a deal.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.933
Oh, my God.
I love you.

19:06.933 --> 19:10.167
I love you too.

[people cheering]

19:16.733 --> 19:19.233
Hey, I mean it.

19:19.233 --> 19:20.433
You do?

19:20.433 --> 19:21.433
Yeah.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.633
I mean, you--you're smart,

19:23.633 --> 19:25.800
and you're beautiful,

19:25.800 --> 19:29.100
and I love how you're just game
for anything.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.867
I love how I feel
when I'm around you.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.367
I love you.

19:35.367 --> 19:39.133
I love you.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.067
I love you too, Josh.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.900
That's why I have
to tell you this.

19:50.167 --> 19:54.300
I'm a 40-year-old mom
from New Jersey.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.100
[laughs] I totally know
how you feel.

19:56.100 --> 19:59.100
Sometimes I feel like I'm a
90-year-old fisherman in Japan.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.867
No, I mean it.
I mean it.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.433
I'm not in my 20s.
I really am 40.
