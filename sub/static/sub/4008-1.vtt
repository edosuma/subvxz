WEBVTT

00:11.291 --> 00:13.725
I need some competition out here.

00:13.794 --> 00:14.954
Come on!

00:17.264 --> 00:19.255
Am I that good, or you that bad?

00:22.803 --> 00:25.237
Check me.
Do something.

00:25.305 --> 00:27.466
Foul me. Come on.

00:33.313 --> 00:35.804
It's rough being this good.

00:37.317 --> 00:38.841
Come on. Come on.

00:41.822 --> 00:42.982
Great point!

00:43.056 --> 00:45.320
I am so good,
or maybe you so bad,

00:45.392 --> 00:48.259
I just don't know
what the difference is.

00:48.328 --> 00:49.488
Come on.

00:51.465 --> 00:52.591
Yeah.

00:55.869 --> 00:58.463
Get off me.
Get off me.

01:02.075 --> 01:04.669
You want this?
Get off of me!

01:05.746 --> 01:07.213
You a chump.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.272
- Fuck you, man.
- Fuck me?

01:16.289 --> 01:17.813
Do that now.

01:22.562 --> 01:23.620
Fuck that.

01:27.768 --> 01:28.757
Yes.

01:31.772 --> 01:34.240
Fuck that bullshit.
Jump.

01:34.307 --> 01:36.901
No-jumping motherfucker.

01:36.977 --> 01:38.706
You can't jump.

01:38.779 --> 01:40.644
I'm waiting.

01:52.726 --> 01:54.455
Nutso!

02:06.606 --> 02:08.198
I couldn't help but notice your pain.

02:08.275 --> 02:10.607
- My pain?
- It runs deep.

02:10.676 --> 02:12.269
Share it with me.

03:44.104 --> 03:45.298
Welcome to my house, Montrose.

03:45.372 --> 03:47.772
What's up?
You can't look at me?

03:47.841 --> 03:51.777
When I come to your place,
will you introduce me to your girl?

03:55.048 --> 03:57.380
Fight them Tigers, tried to dis

03:58.585 --> 04:00.644
We all know your team ain't sh...

04:00.720 --> 04:02.654
Our team is better
than your team

04:02.722 --> 04:05.190
Our team is better
than your team

04:05.258 --> 04:07.658
Our team is better
'cause we sing together

04:07.727 --> 04:09.251
Our team is better than

04:11.264 --> 04:13.323
Our team is better
than your team

04:13.400 --> 04:16.197
Let's make it happen, niggers.

04:16.269 --> 04:18.134
Our team is better
'cause we sing together

04:18.204 --> 04:19.728
Our team is better than

04:24.277 --> 04:28.543
- You crazy.
- All right, back the fuck up!

04:28.615 --> 04:31.209
Back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

04:32.285 --> 04:34.480
Come on.
Let's just play the game.

04:47.968 --> 04:50.835
Call out the picks.
That was your man.

04:57.911 --> 04:58.935
Kyle!

04:59.913 --> 05:01.710
Go there! Go through!

05:01.781 --> 05:03.373
Go through over there, man.

05:09.389 --> 05:13.120
What's up, Mr. North Carolina?
What's up, baby?

05:23.870 --> 05:25.132
Call time! Time!

05:25.205 --> 05:26.263
Time-out! Time-out!

05:28.608 --> 05:30.735
Hustle up. Hustle up.

05:31.745 --> 05:32.734
Settle down.

05:48.862 --> 05:51.092
Work the clock.
If Montrose gets you blocked up,

05:51.164 --> 05:53.792
gets you stopped,
you give it up real quick.

05:53.867 --> 05:56.665
Okay, guys? Let's do it.

05:58.304 --> 05:59.771
Defense on 3.
Defense on 3.

05:59.839 --> 06:02.637
1... 2... 3... Defense!

06:02.709 --> 06:03.698
Kyle.

06:04.711 --> 06:06.178
Use your team.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.646
I got it handled, coach, all right?

06:08.715 --> 06:10.580
Show it to me, then.
Let's go.

06:10.650 --> 06:11.708
Come on!

06:20.126 --> 06:21.184
One!

06:21.261 --> 06:22.728
One, one, one!

06:26.066 --> 06:29.263
Yeah, boy.
You about to get another facial, chump.

06:29.335 --> 06:31.064
Pass the ball!
Use the team!

06:34.274 --> 06:35.263
Jump!

06:36.676 --> 06:37.836
Jump!

06:51.257 --> 06:53.748
He fouled me on my wrist.
How could you miss that?

07:08.708 --> 07:10.903
There it is. There it is.

07:10.977 --> 07:12.376
Your boy ain't shit.

07:12.445 --> 07:15.175
Loco, do-dirty,
go get the ride right now.

07:15.248 --> 07:17.944
Stupid! Listen to me!
Go get the fucking ride.

07:18.017 --> 07:19.177
Hurry up!

07:19.252 --> 07:20.651
Got money to stand on.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.654
What the fuck's with you here...

07:22.722 --> 07:24.656
Did you hear what I said?

07:24.724 --> 07:25.782
You still here?

07:25.859 --> 07:27.656
Get the fuck out of here!

07:27.727 --> 07:30.195
He's worried about losing
his spot on the team.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.663
I'm telling you,
Kyle got mad game.

07:32.732 --> 07:35.200
He's been hustling
since back in the day.

07:35.268 --> 07:37.202
You got to use him, G.

07:37.270 --> 07:38.430
What are you doing?

07:38.505 --> 07:40.666
You telling me
how to run my business?

07:40.740 --> 07:42.264
No. I'm just saying...

07:42.342 --> 07:43.741
Shut up, nigger.
You stupid.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.210
Let's go.
We got money to stand on.

07:46.279 --> 07:49.271
Yo, bring him by the club later,
all right?

07:49.349 --> 07:51.283
- Word?
- Yeah.

07:51.351 --> 07:52.818
All right, cool.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.811
- Mr. Redd.
- Kyle.

07:55.889 --> 07:57.754
Can you believe that last call?

07:57.824 --> 08:00.952
You know it's against NCAA rules
for me to speak with you

08:01.027 --> 08:02.619
without clearing it with your coach.

08:02.695 --> 08:04.993
I won't tell if you won't tell.

08:05.598 --> 08:08.692
It doesn't work that way, son.
Good night.

08:10.236 --> 08:13.831
- Kyle, in the locker room.
- I'm coming.

08:13.907 --> 08:15.238
Now.

08:29.322 --> 08:32.256
- Game's over. Miss!
- What do you think you're doing?

08:32.325 --> 08:34.725
- My job.
- Is that right?

08:34.794 --> 08:37.261
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Damn.

08:37.330 --> 08:40.958
Hey, Monroe...
this man just made me miss Kyle.

08:41.034 --> 08:46.404
Shep is kind of new around here.
Like wet behind the ears.

08:46.472 --> 08:48.406
Don't worry.
I'll straighten him out.

08:48.474 --> 08:50.374
Could you give him
this note for me?

08:50.443 --> 08:52.274
Why don't you wait around?

08:52.345 --> 08:54.677
I'm supposed to be
on my shift right now.

08:54.747 --> 08:58.615
Thank you. Good night.
That is, if I'm allowed to leave now.

09:04.891 --> 09:08.349
Man, sure got a way with women.

09:08.428 --> 09:11.625
Wet behind the ears?
What's that supposed to mean?

09:11.698 --> 09:13.359
I don't think it's funny.

09:13.433 --> 09:16.163
Get some sleep.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

09:16.236 --> 09:17.703
Good night, David.

09:20.974 --> 09:23.169
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

09:23.243 --> 09:24.642
Games like this happen.

09:24.711 --> 09:27.509
What happened is Baby Jordan
fronted on the whole team.

09:27.580 --> 09:28.774
Come on, guys.
Lighten up.

09:28.848 --> 09:30.941
Did you get your shit off
for the Georgetown scout?

09:31.017 --> 09:33.178
How'd it feel when Montrose
made you his bitch?

09:33.253 --> 09:34.652
Fuck you, you muscle-bound scrub.

09:34.721 --> 09:37.918
I'm standing right here.
I ain't goin' nowhere!

09:37.991 --> 09:39.458
That's enough of that.

09:39.525 --> 09:41.993
We'll get another shot at them
in a couple of weeks.

09:42.061 --> 09:45.224
Go on home.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

09:45.298 --> 09:48.199
- I want to see you at 7:30.
- 7:30?

09:48.268 --> 09:49.826
Sharp.

09:50.870 --> 09:53.202
You're going to get your ghost hurt.

09:53.273 --> 09:57.141
The game wouldn't be close
if it wasn't for me, so fuck Starnes.

09:57.210 --> 10:01.670
If it wasn't for that bullshit ref,
he'd be kissing my ass.

10:01.748 --> 10:03.045
Know what I'm saying?

10:05.385 --> 10:06.409
Yeah.

10:08.288 --> 10:10.188
You want to get something to eat?

10:12.091 --> 10:15.720
I've been watching that math teacher,
and math ain't all she knows.

10:15.795 --> 10:17.126
You can believe that.

10:17.897 --> 10:19.228
You seen my mother tonight?

10:19.299 --> 10:22.700
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She told me to give you this.

10:26.439 --> 10:29.704
Oh, Bobby, Kyle, this is
my new partner Tom Sheppard.

10:29.776 --> 10:30.765
What's up?

10:34.314 --> 10:35.303
Damn!

10:35.381 --> 10:37.713
Hey, man, she tried to catch you.

10:37.784 --> 10:39.251
It's all right.

10:39.319 --> 10:40.718
All right.

10:40.787 --> 10:41.776
Shit.

10:45.925 --> 10:48.792
¡Míra! ¡Caramba! ¡Ése!

10:48.861 --> 10:51.796
- Want to get something to eat?
- Sure.

10:51.864 --> 10:53.798
Oh, I see how you're living.

10:53.866 --> 10:56.391
Nigger get a little bit
of inches on him,

10:56.469 --> 10:59.336
start dunking on kids,
and forget about brothers.

10:59.405 --> 11:02.465
Hollywood nigger.
What's up, baby?

11:02.542 --> 11:04.533
Come give me some love.

11:04.610 --> 11:07.135
- Stop trying to front me.
- What's up, bro?

11:07.213 --> 11:08.578
How are you doing, superstar?

11:08.648 --> 11:11.742
- When did you get out?
- A week, man.

11:11.818 --> 11:13.945
They ain't built no jails
that could hold me.

11:15.054 --> 11:18.217
I'm sorry. Bob, this Bug.
Bug, this is Bob.

11:18.291 --> 11:20.691
How are you doing?
A little respect.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.694
Me and Bug played juniors together.

11:22.762 --> 11:25.287
Just check out my shit, please.

11:25.365 --> 11:27.094
500 sit-ups a day.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.567
Niggers was paying me
to wash their drawers on my stomach.

11:30.636 --> 11:33.434
Yo, wait.
Check this. Boom!

11:33.506 --> 11:34.700
That's without baby oil.

11:34.774 --> 11:37.242
So you know my shit is deep.

11:37.310 --> 11:40.245
- You been working on your game?
- Oh, yeah.

11:40.313 --> 11:42.838
I got to do something
to keep my head straight.

11:42.915 --> 11:44.246
I'm dunking all over niggers.

11:44.317 --> 11:46.649
Like, get off of me!

11:46.719 --> 11:49.153
- What are you doing here?
- I'm waiting on you.

11:49.222 --> 11:51.315
- Guess who I'm rolling with.
- Who?

11:51.391 --> 11:52.483
Birdie. Me.

11:52.558 --> 11:54.253
The kid was at the game.

11:54.327 --> 11:55.954
- He wants to meet you.
- For what?

11:56.029 --> 11:58.862
It's a surprise.
Get your shit.

11:58.931 --> 12:01.399
Bobby, I'm going to
check you tomorrow.

12:01.467 --> 12:02.525
Cool out.

12:18.785 --> 12:20.480
Close your mouth.
Come on.

12:20.553 --> 12:22.953
Act like you never seen a ass before.

12:23.022 --> 12:24.489
What's up, man?

12:24.557 --> 12:26.684
Is that you, or what?

12:27.493 --> 12:30.257
Well, then pass it if it ain't.
Let's boogie some.

12:31.898 --> 12:33.388
You know what I'm saying?

12:33.466 --> 12:34.956
Hey, what's up, Birdie?

12:35.034 --> 12:36.729
This is my man Kyle Lee Watson.

12:36.803 --> 12:38.964
Kyle Lee Watson, my man Birdie.

12:39.906 --> 12:41.237
Superstar of Monarch, huh?

12:41.307 --> 12:42.672
Kyle Lee Watson?

12:42.742 --> 12:45.233
What kind of country ass name is that?

12:45.311 --> 12:48.747
Sounds like a motherfucker
with a big 1967 afro out to here.

12:48.815 --> 12:50.442
Were you in The Mod Squad?

12:53.052 --> 12:56.715
No, for real. You tore
shit up out there tonight, man.

12:56.789 --> 13:00.589
I'm glad somebody see it that way,
'cause my coach was all over my case.

13:00.660 --> 13:03.652
Yeah?
You sure look like the man to me.

13:05.264 --> 13:07.596
See that? I like that.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.225
He's straight out the gut.

13:09.302 --> 13:11.133
It's like none of
this shit impresses him.

13:11.204 --> 13:14.935
I like that, homeboy.
Let me show you around the club.

13:23.049 --> 13:24.141
Oh, really?

13:29.288 --> 13:30.949
How many brothers
and sisters you got?

13:31.023 --> 13:32.650
Just me and my mom.

13:33.893 --> 13:35.758
Being alone makes you strong.

13:35.828 --> 13:38.319
You and me a lot alike that way.

13:38.764 --> 13:41.232
He with me, homeboy.
It's cool.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.632
You're going to like it up here.

13:57.350 --> 13:59.318
Damn, I'd like to
get me some of that.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.182
Call her over here.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.689
- Yeah, right.
- Go ahead.

14:20.806 --> 14:22.205
All right, all right.

14:22.275 --> 14:24.470
Y'all gonna get
my club closed down.

14:24.544 --> 14:27.741
Let's get a drink.
Got plenty of time for that later.

14:30.082 --> 14:32.209
All right, take it easy on him, baby.

14:32.285 --> 14:34.116
It's his first time.

14:42.261 --> 14:44.752
What do you want to drink?
Give him some orange juice.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.855
Steal a couple of minutes
with you later?

14:46.933 --> 14:49.424
Let me introduce you to somebody.
Friend of mine.

14:49.502 --> 14:52.369
I know Kyle Watson.
You got a nice game.

14:52.438 --> 14:53.632
Thanks.

14:53.706 --> 14:57.164
You really snuck up on us,
growin' 4 inches over the summer.

14:57.243 --> 14:59.575
Kids like this keep me on my toes.

14:59.645 --> 15:03.706
Think you got everybody figured,
and then... like that, they change.

15:03.783 --> 15:05.512
You're still unsigned, right?

15:05.585 --> 15:07.712
Waiting on Georgetown?

15:07.787 --> 15:09.687
How did you know that?

15:09.755 --> 15:12.223
It's my business.

15:12.291 --> 15:16.193
I know a lot of schools that would
like a nice point guard like you.

15:17.063 --> 15:19.031
Well, I guess you got
the shoot-out now

15:19.098 --> 15:20.725
locked up with Kyle, huh?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.062
What are you, about an 11?

15:22.134 --> 15:24.102
111/2.

15:25.805 --> 15:27.204
See you around.

15:27.273 --> 15:29.605
- I'll catch you, B.
- All right, man.

15:30.876 --> 15:32.673
What's up, man?

15:32.745 --> 15:34.508
You running with me or what?

15:36.916 --> 15:38.577
Hey, look, Birdie, I'd like to,

15:38.651 --> 15:41.313
but my coach already
asked me to run with him.

15:41.387 --> 15:43.412
Come on.
Not the same coach

15:43.489 --> 15:45.650
that was tripping
on your game, right?

15:45.725 --> 15:49.422
There's more to life to getting a shot
than just hitting that jumper,

15:49.495 --> 15:50.826
you know what I'm sayin'?

15:50.896 --> 15:53.592
I know you want the finer things in life.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.099
I can get them for you.

15:55.167 --> 15:58.625
All you got to decide
is how bad you want it.

15:58.704 --> 16:00.262
I wouldn't ask you to play for me

16:00.339 --> 16:02.864
unless it was good
for the both of us.

16:02.942 --> 16:04.739
The both of us.

16:06.245 --> 16:08.770
Just think about it, all right?

16:14.086 --> 16:15.178
What's this for?

16:15.254 --> 16:17.222
Just a little incentive.

16:17.290 --> 16:19.520
Birdie, I can't take
your money, man.

16:19.592 --> 16:21.719
Come on, man.
You're embarrassing me.

16:21.794 --> 16:24.729
You're a guest.
Everything in here costs.

16:24.797 --> 16:25.923
Everything.

16:27.266 --> 16:30.702
Look at her.
She wants you, man.

16:31.604 --> 16:33.196
Go ask her for a dance.

16:33.272 --> 16:35.968
Ask her for more than that.
Tell her I sent you.

16:37.810 --> 16:41.075
Yeah, all right, Birdie.
Thanks, man.

16:41.147 --> 16:42.375
All right.

16:46.085 --> 16:48.178
Send me a bottle of champagne
over to my table.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.882
Watch out, girl.
What's up?

16:54.894 --> 16:56.293
Kyle Watson at point?

16:56.362 --> 16:59.729
I got too much money
on this game to be fucking around.

17:00.299 --> 17:01.288
Come on.

17:02.635 --> 17:04.728
Get off me.
Get off me!

17:09.974 --> 17:12.239
Yeah, remember that one?

17:14.046 --> 17:15.240
Get off me!

17:15.314 --> 17:17.578
What you got there, huh?

17:20.586 --> 17:22.247
Over here... over there!

17:24.457 --> 17:26.117
Get off of me!

17:26.192 --> 17:28.387
Come on, come on.

17:30.262 --> 17:32.253
Get your hands off me.

17:33.666 --> 17:34.860
Get off of me.

17:38.270 --> 17:39.737
Come get this.
Come on.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.031
Game.

18:30.189 --> 18:31.178
Excuse me.

18:31.257 --> 18:34.715
Think you can kiss me
anytime you feel like it?

18:34.794 --> 18:36.193
Anytime.
Is there a problem?

18:36.262 --> 18:39.197
- You better sit down.
- And if I don't?

18:39.265 --> 18:40.732
Okay, all right.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.789
All right!

18:45.337 --> 18:47.271
How was the game last night?

18:47.339 --> 18:49.807
- Is this all the mail there was?
- Yes.

18:50.943 --> 18:54.811
Kyle, you cannot make yourself crazy
waiting for a recruitment letter.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.279
Do you understand?

18:56.348 --> 18:58.816
Phil Redd wouldn't talk to me last night.

18:58.884 --> 19:00.875
I housed Montrose.
He's going to North Carolina.

19:00.953 --> 19:03.217
- Where am I going?
- To college.

19:03.289 --> 19:06.349
- Not if I don't get recruited.
- Even if you don't.

19:06.425 --> 19:07.551
To where, City College?

19:07.626 --> 19:09.287
They don't have a team.

19:09.361 --> 19:11.693
Your future does not
depend on basketball.

19:11.764 --> 19:13.163
See, that is the problem.

19:13.232 --> 19:15.166
You don't think I'm good enough.

19:15.234 --> 19:17.759
- I know you are. It's just that...
- It's just that nothing!

19:17.837 --> 19:22.035
I don't care if you don't believe in me
or don't come to my games.

19:22.107 --> 19:25.167
I was working.
That's why I missed your game.

19:25.244 --> 19:27.178
That's why I want this scholarship,

19:27.246 --> 19:29.714
so you won't have to work so hard.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.249
Who is it?

19:32.318 --> 19:33.717
It's Bugaloo. What's up?

19:33.786 --> 19:37.552
Is that the friend you were out with
till 1:00 in the morning?

19:37.623 --> 19:39.215
I don't care if you're an All-American.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.122
Don't miss your curfew again.

19:42.294 --> 19:44.023
Hey, what's up, baby?
How are you doing?

19:45.264 --> 19:47.198
Ready to hit that blacktop, kid?

19:47.266 --> 19:49.666
I'm not going to tolerate this.

19:49.735 --> 19:51.999
What's up, Miss Watson?
How you doing?

19:52.071 --> 19:53.470
Remember me?

19:53.539 --> 19:55.268
Trust me, Mom.

19:58.077 --> 20:01.308
I'll see you at Wilson's after practice.

20:06.819 --> 20:09.754
I thought moms was about
to beat your ass.

20:09.822 --> 20:11.756
Moms wasn't going to do shit.

20:11.824 --> 20:14.759
You still getting spankings.
You a grown man.

20:14.827 --> 20:17.227
I got to take a leak.

20:17.296 --> 20:19.230
What the fuck is wrong
with your plumbing?

20:19.298 --> 20:22.825
- I had to get up out of there.
- Word.

20:24.036 --> 20:26.766
Damn, G, I didn't know
you was uncircumcised.

20:26.839 --> 20:28.773
Your dick like an anteater.

20:29.508 --> 20:31.738
But it's so big.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.835
You been lifting weights
with your dang-dang?

20:33.913 --> 20:35.505
That big old dick.

20:35.581 --> 20:39.244
I've been lifting your moms with my dick.
Now shut the fuck up, man.

20:39.318 --> 20:40.785
Fuck you, man.

20:40.853 --> 20:43.344
Kyle, think your
moms remember me?

20:43.422 --> 20:46.858
No disrespect, Kyle,
but your moms got a fat ass.

20:46.926 --> 20:48.325
It's a pow!

20:48.394 --> 20:50.862
How do you expect me to piss

20:50.930 --> 20:52.921
when you're talking
about my moms, man?

20:52.998 --> 20:54.158
Shut up.

20:55.234 --> 20:57.293
Talk about your father, then.

20:58.704 --> 21:00.137
Oh, shit.

21:00.205 --> 21:03.299
Talking about dicks too much.
Been locked up in jail too long, nigger.

21:04.677 --> 21:07.077
Oh, yeah. There you go.

21:07.146 --> 21:08.135
Yo, Kyle.

21:08.213 --> 21:09.510
Kyle, look up, nigger.

21:09.582 --> 21:10.742
Someone's coming.

21:12.084 --> 21:14.075
Hey, yo, put that shit away, man!

21:28.834 --> 21:29.926
Pick it up!
Pick it up!

21:30.002 --> 21:31.765
Come on!
Keep up!

21:31.837 --> 21:33.099
I'm coming!

21:36.842 --> 21:38.969
Come on, Bug.

21:39.044 --> 21:40.773
Come on, nigger.
Let me get some oxygen!

21:40.846 --> 21:41.904
Damn!

21:41.981 --> 21:44.313
You didn't say that
when Big-Dick Bubba

21:44.383 --> 21:46.317
was chasing you around the cell.

21:46.385 --> 21:47.579
Come on, sweetie.

21:47.653 --> 21:49.177
For the money!

21:49.254 --> 21:50.983
There we go.
When I finish with you,

21:51.056 --> 21:53.115
your moms ain't gonna be
dunking on you no more.

21:53.192 --> 21:54.454
Fuck you, man.

21:57.262 --> 21:58.854
Birdie gets you mad pumped.

21:58.931 --> 22:00.831
You ain't no slouch yourself, Bug.

22:02.167 --> 22:03.191
Word?

22:03.268 --> 22:05.133
So you really think I got game?

22:05.871 --> 22:07.463
Definitely.

22:08.941 --> 22:10.875
See that there, baby?

22:10.943 --> 22:13.207
So I could play college ball, too?

22:13.278 --> 22:15.212
Somebody's got to sit the bench

22:15.280 --> 22:17.407
while I'm lighting shit up.

22:17.483 --> 22:19.678
Why you trying to play me?

22:19.752 --> 22:23.210
You know I'll get some P.T.
Up in that motherfucker.

22:23.288 --> 22:25.347
Yo, Kyle, check out
my Sports Illustrated pose

22:25.424 --> 22:27.358
after me and you win
the championship, sweetie.

22:29.361 --> 22:31.921
Get off of me!

22:33.298 --> 22:34.765
Oh, shit!

22:34.833 --> 22:36.824
Would you look
at this motherfucker here?

22:36.902 --> 22:39.928
He like Daffy Duck
with his beak shot off.

22:40.839 --> 22:42.329
Man, that's just Flip.

22:42.408 --> 22:43.932
He's only looking for cigarette butts.

22:44.009 --> 22:46.000
You know, he be
walking around going...

22:46.078 --> 22:48.137
sharing with
everybody else's cigarettes.

22:48.213 --> 22:51.307
- Yo, Flip, we got work to do here.
- Yo, man.

22:55.387 --> 22:57.787
Which one of y'all
want a piece of me?

22:59.425 --> 23:01.723
Come on, Flip, man.
Why don't you just give it up?

23:01.794 --> 23:03.489
Not till you play me.

23:04.129 --> 23:07.223
Kyle, my man can dribble,
But can he wash his stanky ass?

23:07.299 --> 23:09.233
I don't think he can
find his stanky ass.

23:12.171 --> 23:15.197
You're real tough hanging
with that cat-dick motherfucker.

23:15.274 --> 23:18.175
If you had balls, you'd play me
for some real live boonks.

23:19.278 --> 23:21.712
Ain't that some shit
our grandfathers played for?

23:21.780 --> 23:23.748
Why don't you take your ass
back on the bench

23:23.816 --> 23:26.546
before we tie you up
and brush your teeth?

23:27.619 --> 23:29.746
You're a pussy without the hair.

23:29.822 --> 23:32.882
Boy, I'll kiss you in your hot mouth.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.392
Yo, man, me and Flip
gonna play in private.

23:35.461 --> 23:37.759
All right.
Bet.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.229
First basket wins.

23:39.298 --> 23:43.166
Loser get crazy hard Spalding
written-on-your-ass boonks.

23:43.235 --> 23:45.135
It don't make
no difference to me, man.

23:45.204 --> 23:47.536
- Is it a bet?
- Don't make no diff...

23:47.606 --> 23:48.937
Take the ball out.

23:49.007 --> 23:50.668
Got attitude, don't you?

23:51.176 --> 23:54.168
I'll go over the top
on your punk ass.

23:54.246 --> 23:55.474
They used to call me Gus, boy.

23:55.547 --> 23:57.981
You don't know nothing about me, man.

23:58.050 --> 23:59.608
Here we go.
Here we go.

24:02.254 --> 24:03.721
Call me Mr. Pussy.

24:03.789 --> 24:06.849
Call me Mr. Pussy, old-timer.

24:06.925 --> 24:09.052
Get off!
Get off him!

24:09.128 --> 24:10.527
Come on, old school.

24:10.596 --> 24:13.121
What you got?
What you got?

24:13.198 --> 24:15.189
You're playing one-on-bum, G.

24:15.267 --> 24:16.700
This is going down in history.

24:17.269 --> 24:18.463
Come on!

24:18.537 --> 24:19.936
Come back here, boy!

24:20.005 --> 24:22.200
Come back here!
Come back here!

24:22.274 --> 24:23.741
Come back here.

24:23.809 --> 24:26.744
Go stop some traffic
with them yellow eyes.

24:26.812 --> 24:28.803
Fuck you, man.
Fuck you!

24:31.583 --> 24:33.414
Come with me.
Come on.

24:33.485 --> 24:35.282
Show time, bitch.

24:35.354 --> 24:36.514
Show time.

24:37.656 --> 24:39.214
We didn't wait for you, baby.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.883
Get up there.

24:40.959 --> 24:42.426
I know you like that position.

24:42.494 --> 24:43.483
I slipped.

24:43.562 --> 24:44.756
Yeah, yeah.

24:44.830 --> 24:46.092
I slipped, you little punk.

24:46.165 --> 24:47.792
Now I'm Vinnie Johnson on your ass.

24:47.866 --> 24:50.096
Old school, I'll show you.

24:50.169 --> 24:51.158
Come on!

24:52.905 --> 24:54.133
Get on!

24:55.107 --> 24:56.438
Get off me!

24:58.911 --> 25:00.139
Yo, Flip,
what's up, man?

25:00.212 --> 25:01.236
A deal's a deal.

25:01.313 --> 25:03.178
What's up with the boonks?

25:03.248 --> 25:06.183
What you walking up on me
like John Gotti?

25:06.251 --> 25:08.185
You don't want none of this.

25:08.253 --> 25:10.153
You don't want none of this here!

25:12.157 --> 25:14.387
I know you ain't gonna let that nigger
bitch you like that.

25:16.195 --> 25:17.856
Yeah! Kick!
Yeah!

25:17.930 --> 25:19.864
Yeah!
Bust him, boy!

25:19.932 --> 25:21.729
You smell like a park bum.

25:28.273 --> 25:30.207
What the fuck's wrong with you?

25:30.275 --> 25:31.401
Man, what's...

25:32.611 --> 25:34.078
Just like I thought.

25:37.482 --> 25:40.280
I don't need no
motherfucking help, man.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.811
Sheppard?

25:43.889 --> 25:45.288
Tommy Sheppard?

25:45.357 --> 25:47.825
Man, I thought you were dead.

25:47.893 --> 25:50.157
Oh, man.
Now I've seen it all.

25:50.229 --> 25:51.924
A bum with a bodyguard.

25:58.904 --> 26:01.236
You're going to let them
talk to us like that, man?

26:01.306 --> 26:04.639
Forget about it, Flip.
Go home.

26:04.710 --> 26:07.440
That's the point, man.
He ain't got no home.

26:07.512 --> 26:09.980
He ain't got shit 'cause he ain't shit.

26:11.316 --> 26:12.908
That's enough.

26:17.623 --> 26:18.851
Go home.

26:22.794 --> 26:25.786
They can't erase what we were, man.

26:27.766 --> 26:29.859
Sheppard, they can't
erase what we were, baby.

26:30.869 --> 26:32.530
Champions, baby.

26:34.706 --> 26:37.106
They can't erase
what we were, man.

27:08.974 --> 27:10.100
Morning.

27:10.175 --> 27:12.109
How you doing, coach?

27:12.177 --> 27:13.644
I've been better.

27:13.712 --> 27:17.170
We were too damn close
not to win last night.

27:17.249 --> 27:18.511
It happens.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.517
Not when you were playing.

27:22.087 --> 27:26.183
Hey... l'm coaching a team
in the shoot-out if you're interested.

27:26.258 --> 27:27.782
I'm not.

27:28.994 --> 27:30.859
I put your name on the list anyway.

27:30.929 --> 27:33.727
Call it an old coach's dream.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.889
So...

27:35.968 --> 27:38.198
You gonna help me
get down to Florida

27:38.270 --> 27:40.602
or make me stay here and freeze?

27:40.672 --> 27:42.697
I'm not keeping you here.

27:42.774 --> 27:44.799
Until you agree
to replace me, you are.

27:44.876 --> 27:46.810
That's why you got me this job?

27:46.878 --> 27:50.245
I hate to say no,
but I ain't nobody's coach.

27:50.315 --> 27:52.613
Bullshit.
You're wrong about that.

27:53.618 --> 27:56.280
Look, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just getting too old,

27:56.355 --> 27:58.653
but I don't understand
these kids anymore.

27:58.724 --> 28:00.692
You could do a lot of good here.

28:00.759 --> 28:03.694
I came here to bury my mom
and take this job.

28:03.762 --> 28:05.753
Basketball is not part of the plan.

28:05.831 --> 28:08.994
- Plans can change.
- Not this one.

28:11.169 --> 28:12.158
All right.

28:12.237 --> 28:14.705
I've got a lot of work to do
in the office.

28:14.773 --> 28:17.765
But at least think about it, will you?

28:19.778 --> 28:21.712
If Kyle Watson shows up,

28:21.780 --> 28:25.375
you tell him to get his butt
into my office pronto.

28:27.452 --> 28:29.784
I ain't no coach, Mike.

28:34.259 --> 28:36.159
I ain't no coach.

28:42.234 --> 28:43.258
Yo, what's up?

28:43.335 --> 28:45.963
You know it's a good thing
you pulled me off that bum.

28:46.038 --> 28:47.869
The whole shit was his fault, man.

28:47.939 --> 28:50.965
Nobody fronts me
when I'm playing hoops.

28:51.043 --> 28:52.806
What am I telling you for?

28:52.878 --> 28:54.436
It's not like you understand.

28:55.547 --> 28:57.447
Coach wants to see you in his office.

28:57.516 --> 28:59.609
Yeah, well, coach can wait.

28:59.684 --> 29:01.151
Why don't you watch?

29:01.219 --> 29:04.154
You might learn
a little something from me.

29:07.092 --> 29:08.491
How do you like that, toy cop?

29:08.560 --> 29:10.687
Snap your wrists more.

29:10.762 --> 29:12.525
Excuse me?

29:12.597 --> 29:14.963
The ball needs rotation.
Spread your fingers.

29:16.701 --> 29:18.635
This is Candid Camera, right?

29:18.703 --> 29:21.638
A toy cop is going
to teach Kyle Watson

29:21.706 --> 29:23.640
how to shoot a jump shot.

29:23.708 --> 29:26.700
You rent a Dick Vitale video
or some shit?

29:28.413 --> 29:30.973
Actually, I saw you miss
that jumper last night.

29:32.184 --> 29:34.118
Why don't I stick to basketball

29:34.186 --> 29:36.984
and you stick to saving bums
in the park?

29:40.125 --> 29:42.150
You forget how to read a clock?

29:44.429 --> 29:47.660
What, you think I got 30 minutes
to waste waiting for you?

29:47.732 --> 29:49.666
In my office.

29:59.811 --> 30:02.302
The next time you're late
for a meeting with me,

30:02.380 --> 30:05.747
you'll be doing laps until you drop.

30:05.817 --> 30:07.284
Sit down.

30:15.427 --> 30:18.021
What are you doing
talking to Phil Redd?

30:18.096 --> 30:19.825
You want to make yourself ineligible?

30:19.898 --> 30:22.230
The man wouldn't look me in the eye.

30:22.300 --> 30:26.259
I just wanted to know when he
was sending my recruitment letter.

30:26.338 --> 30:29.569
The guy is here at every game
just to watch you.

30:29.641 --> 30:31.768
You can't be sure.
You know that.

30:31.843 --> 30:34.778
Especially if you keep playing
like you did last night.

30:34.846 --> 30:36.370
What's that supposed to mean?

30:36.448 --> 30:38.109
You forgot about your team.

30:38.183 --> 30:40.447
I had 22 points and 8 rebounds.

30:40.519 --> 30:41.713
And we lost.

30:41.786 --> 30:44.653
Then maybe the entire team
should be here instead of just me.

30:44.723 --> 30:47.624
Nobody else had a good game.

30:47.692 --> 30:49.523
You didn't give them a chance to.

30:49.594 --> 30:51.585
That's what recruiters look at.

30:51.663 --> 30:55.463
We both know there's more to making it
than what happens on the court.

30:55.534 --> 30:57.365
What is that supposed to mean?

30:58.937 --> 31:00.165
Nothing.

31:01.239 --> 31:03.264
Listen, I have homeroom
in about five minutes.

31:03.341 --> 31:05.536
Are we about done?

31:05.610 --> 31:08.875
What is it with this attitude, Kyle?
I'm trying to help you.

31:08.947 --> 31:12.747
I'm just worried about homeroom.
Okay?

31:12.817 --> 31:15.411
All right.
You keep it up,

31:15.487 --> 31:19.082
and you'll have a hell of a lot more
to worry about than just homeroom.

31:19.157 --> 31:21.284
Go on.
Get out of here.

31:25.430 --> 31:26.761
By the way, coach,

31:26.831 --> 31:30.358
I decided to run with another team
in the shoot-out.

31:42.013 --> 31:43.708
Red! Blue!

31:43.782 --> 31:45.716
Red!
Blue!

31:45.784 --> 31:47.843
Red! Blue!

31:47.919 --> 31:49.318
On the ball!

31:49.387 --> 31:50.979
Hustle back!
Hustle back!

31:51.056 --> 31:53.047
Easy. Nice and soft.

31:53.124 --> 31:54.921
Come on, baby.
Hustle. Hustle.

31:54.993 --> 31:56.858
Come on, come on,
come on.

31:56.928 --> 31:57.986
Yeah.

31:58.063 --> 32:00.429
Get down. Get down.
Get down. Get down.

32:00.498 --> 32:02.125
Move it!

32:02.200 --> 32:03.792
Soft. Easy.

32:03.868 --> 32:05.665
Nice. Touch it!

32:05.737 --> 32:08.729
Come on!
There we go.

32:11.209 --> 32:13.006
Go!

32:15.880 --> 32:17.279
Come on!

33:23.548 --> 33:27.245
Finally made it back
for the old lady's birthday, huh?

33:29.287 --> 33:32.814
- How long you been home?
- A couple weeks.

33:37.829 --> 33:40.229
Why didn't you call me, man?

33:40.298 --> 33:42.858
I knew you'd be back.

33:42.934 --> 33:44.697
I knew you would.

33:45.337 --> 33:47.999
Your little brother done came up, man.

33:48.073 --> 33:49.836
- Really?
- Hell, yeah.

33:49.908 --> 33:54.038
I mean, shit got bad.
Real bad.

33:54.112 --> 33:56.307
Be up in that damn bodega
with mama food stamps,

33:56.381 --> 33:58.349
and motherfuckers
be laughing at me.

33:58.416 --> 34:02.182
Can you believe that?
They was laughing at me.

34:03.388 --> 34:06.585
We had no lights,
no electricity, no food.

34:06.658 --> 34:07.716
We wrapped up in our coats

34:07.792 --> 34:10.090
in front of the stove
in the wintertime.

34:10.161 --> 34:13.187
Mama with that
sad-ass look on her face

34:13.264 --> 34:16.255
talking about,
"Oh, Shep. Oh, Shep."

34:17.802 --> 34:20.270
She actually believed
you was coming back

34:20.338 --> 34:23.330
to save us or some shit.

34:27.277 --> 34:30.213
It's all right, though.
I handled shit.

34:30.281 --> 34:32.215
We got a split-level duplex,

34:32.283 --> 34:34.274
big-screen TV, marble floors.

34:34.351 --> 34:36.286
Mama ain't have to work.

34:36.353 --> 34:39.846
She seen more money in her life
than she ever had.

34:40.692 --> 34:44.286
And I did that.
I brought that back.

34:45.362 --> 34:48.696
With us side by side,
together as brothers,

34:48.766 --> 34:51.634
can't nothing stop us.
Nothing.

34:54.105 --> 34:56.300
You think I came back here
to work for you?

34:56.373 --> 34:59.571
Come on, man.
We brothers.

34:59.644 --> 35:01.305
Wouldn't have you working for me.

35:01.379 --> 35:02.710
We'd be partners.

35:03.982 --> 35:07.782
What, selling that shit?
Are you that dumb?

35:13.091 --> 35:15.184
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to, man?

35:15.260 --> 35:16.727
This ain't Nutso.

35:16.795 --> 35:20.287
This ain't that dopehead on the roof
taking orders from you.

35:20.365 --> 35:23.732
This ain't your same little brother
following behind you.

35:23.802 --> 35:26.270
You ain't the motherfuckin' man
no more.

35:26.337 --> 35:27.804
I'm the one!

35:28.807 --> 35:30.206
Shit has changed!

35:30.275 --> 35:32.209
It's a new day, bro.

35:32.277 --> 35:35.838
If you can't clean up your act,

35:35.914 --> 35:40.351
I suggest you raise the fuck up
and get the hell out of Dodge...

35:41.820 --> 35:43.947
or get caught up.

36:10.782 --> 36:13.012
Anything else?

36:13.084 --> 36:14.381
Nothing.

36:14.452 --> 36:15.976
You sure?

36:19.190 --> 36:21.124
You know what I think?

36:21.192 --> 36:25.253
I think there's something pitiful
about a good-looking man like you

36:25.330 --> 36:28.663
coming in every day by yourself,
ordering the same food,

36:28.733 --> 36:30.064
never smiling, never talking,

36:30.134 --> 36:33.535
never doing nothing except eating
and then leaving.

36:33.605 --> 36:35.266
You know what I think?

36:35.340 --> 36:38.741
I think you need someone to make you
a good home-cooked meal

36:38.810 --> 36:41.142
and make you smile.

36:46.885 --> 36:48.819
Ain't you gonna say something?

36:50.889 --> 36:53.119
Why don't you get me
some more water?

36:54.826 --> 36:55.884
Water.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.701
Are you done?

37:13.444 --> 37:16.038
Excuse me.
Are you finished?

37:19.918 --> 37:22.751
I was just asking if you were done.
There are no tables.

37:22.820 --> 37:26.153
I'm sorry.
I am.

37:26.224 --> 37:29.489
- Maybe you should ease up on the coffee.
- Right.

37:32.330 --> 37:34.264
We met last night.

37:34.332 --> 37:36.266
I'm Mailika Watson.

37:36.334 --> 37:38.268
Tommy Sheppard.

37:38.336 --> 37:40.270
Don't waste your time, sis.

37:40.338 --> 37:44.297
It may look sweet,
but it's gone sour.

37:45.009 --> 37:46.806
You have this effect on everybody?

37:46.878 --> 37:48.869
I hope not.

37:50.415 --> 37:52.815
I guess I'll see you around.

37:52.884 --> 37:53.942
I guess.

37:55.853 --> 37:57.013
Bye.

38:00.425 --> 38:01.687
Look-a here.

38:01.759 --> 38:04.227
Got rid of those nut huggers, huh?

38:04.295 --> 38:06.286
Where are you coming from,
Bible study?

38:12.303 --> 38:15.238
That new guard is a trip.

38:15.306 --> 38:17.035
Seems nice to me.

38:17.108 --> 38:18.700
What do you mean by that?

38:18.776 --> 38:19.902
Exactly what I said.

38:19.978 --> 38:22.913
We've got to order.
I'm on my shift.

38:22.981 --> 38:24.846
We were going to the movies.

38:24.916 --> 38:27.714
I'm sorry, but you'll
have to go by yourself.

38:27.785 --> 38:29.252
Figures.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.378
That's right.

38:30.455 --> 38:34.255
You're not in the NBA yet,
and I've still got to work.

38:34.325 --> 38:35.724
You said yet.

38:35.793 --> 38:37.522
Miss! Miss!

38:37.595 --> 38:38.721
Can we please order?

38:38.796 --> 38:41.060
You said yet.
You know I'm going.

38:42.567 --> 38:43.864
I'm so crazy

38:43.935 --> 38:46.870
I'd skin my own mama
and I'd fat us up

38:46.938 --> 38:47.996
Like Jeffrey-fucking-Dahmer

38:48.072 --> 38:50.802
I'm a wild type of nigger
with a comma

38:52.543 --> 38:54.807
Kyle, is that your man right there,

38:54.879 --> 38:57.814
the security guard
we had a beef with?

38:57.882 --> 38:59.747
Why is that nigger bugging out?

38:59.817 --> 39:01.978
He's playing ball without a ball.

39:04.088 --> 39:06.488
He look like he auditioning
for The Twilight Zone.

39:08.526 --> 39:10.790
Holy shit.

39:14.298 --> 39:15.287
Oh, shit.

39:17.035 --> 39:19.230
He better leave that shit alone,

39:19.303 --> 39:20.702
whatever he fuckin' with.

39:21.773 --> 39:25.300
- Yo, Mo, don't sell to that nigger.
- I ain't.

39:27.812 --> 39:30.940
Yo, Kyle,
tell this funny-looking nigger

39:31.015 --> 39:33.176
how long it took me to call you back
after you beeped me.

39:33.251 --> 39:35.151
- A couple of minutes.
- A couple of what?

39:35.219 --> 39:37.710
A couple of minutes.
A couple of minutes, Mo.

39:37.789 --> 39:40.257
That's called good business.
Prompt service.

39:40.324 --> 39:41.723
You know what I'm saying?

39:41.793 --> 39:43.988
Get the fuck out of my ear.

39:45.329 --> 39:48.730
Anyway, yo, Kyle,
I told Birdie that you was in.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.267
Money was hyped.

39:50.334 --> 39:52.734
He had like an orgasm and shit.

39:52.804 --> 39:54.999
I think that nigger like winning
more than money

39:55.073 --> 39:57.598
and twice as much as pussy and shit.

39:57.675 --> 39:59.609
Motherfucker jerk off to winning.

40:01.345 --> 40:03.279
All right.
Is you motherfuckers finished?

40:03.347 --> 40:04.871
Y'all finished?

40:04.949 --> 40:07.110
You silly motherfuckers.

40:07.185 --> 40:09.676
You got to be soldiers,
all right?

40:09.754 --> 40:11.278
Soldiers.

40:11.355 --> 40:13.687
Not clowns, God damn it!
Drive!

40:13.758 --> 40:15.521
And you shut the fuck up.

40:21.165 --> 40:23.224
Yo, man, why you be trying
to stare me down?

40:23.301 --> 40:25.292
Don't mind that nigger.
He's just mad.

40:25.369 --> 40:28.964
He'll be sittin' the bench
and you playing point and shit.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.770
He got his period and shit.
I'll get you some pads.

40:32.844 --> 40:34.903
Mini or maxi, what you take?

40:34.979 --> 40:36.310
Tampons?

40:36.380 --> 40:37.813
Let me tell you something.

40:38.583 --> 40:40.710
Let me tell you something!

40:40.785 --> 40:42.377
I don't give a fuck what Birdie said.

40:42.453 --> 40:45.320
I don't give a damn about this
whore-ass nigger in the back.

40:45.389 --> 40:47.414
I'll bury the both of you motherfuckers.

40:47.492 --> 40:50.689
You better start listening
and stop playing.

40:53.331 --> 40:55.231
Pull over.
Pull over right here.

40:55.299 --> 40:57.096
I thought we was going
straight to the spot.

40:57.168 --> 40:59.295
- Nigger, I said pull over.
- For what?

40:59.437 --> 41:01.200
Pull over!

41:08.946 --> 41:10.413
My niggers.

41:10.481 --> 41:12.881
- Yo, what's up?
- Payday.

41:12.950 --> 41:16.215
Payday, brothers.
Run it. Come on.

41:23.728 --> 41:25.218
That nigger's out of his fucking mind.

41:26.497 --> 41:28.897
Come here, nigger.
You don't understand?

41:28.966 --> 41:32.834
Don't ever hold out on me.
You got that?

41:44.448 --> 41:46.382
Did you motherfuckers see that?

41:46.450 --> 41:47.849
I'm a motherfucking soldier!

41:47.919 --> 41:50.649
You know what I'm saying?
Now drive!

41:52.924 --> 41:54.858
You need a role model...

41:54.926 --> 41:57.326
or a hug or something.

41:58.863 --> 42:00.854
Hey, Mr. Cop!

42:02.333 --> 42:04.267
Hey, Mr. Cop!
Wait up!

42:04.335 --> 42:05.734
You the one exercising.

42:05.803 --> 42:08.271
- What's up?
- Me. Too damn early.

42:08.339 --> 42:10.273
I saw you playing last night.

42:10.341 --> 42:12.172
You got a few moves for an old man.

42:12.243 --> 42:14.268
- Feel like playing?
- No.

42:14.345 --> 42:16.210
Just one quick game.
I'll take it easy on you.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.738
- I said no.
- Just one quick game.

42:19.817 --> 42:21.751
Is you hard of hearing?

42:21.819 --> 42:23.616
What's wrong with you?

42:25.990 --> 42:27.150
Whatever.

42:33.831 --> 42:36.026
Wrap it up.
Hustle back. Hustle back.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.068
Close it up!
Half court!

42:38.703 --> 42:40.762
Nice! Nice!
Come on! Come on!

42:40.838 --> 42:42.032
Nice touch!

42:42.106 --> 42:44.199
Right on the spot. Okay.

42:44.275 --> 42:45.708
Find the mark!
Find the mark!

42:47.311 --> 42:48.642
And come back.

42:50.114 --> 42:51.172
And up!

42:51.249 --> 42:53.444
Find the mark!
Find the mark!

42:53.517 --> 42:54.984
Hustle! Come on, guys!

42:55.052 --> 42:56.644
Back! Back! Back! Back!

43:05.796 --> 43:08.731
So, you give up that coffee yet?

43:08.799 --> 43:10.266
Hi. How you doing?

43:10.334 --> 43:12.268
I'm good.
How about you?

43:12.336 --> 43:13.735
All right.

43:13.804 --> 43:15.601
Two, right?

43:17.909 --> 43:19.342
Yeah.

43:24.615 --> 43:26.549
Birdie's crib was dope, man!

43:26.617 --> 43:28.084
Oh, no, no, no.
She's bad.

43:28.152 --> 43:31.280
I did her one night.
Six bags.

43:31.355 --> 43:32.583
You ain't worth no six bags.

43:32.657 --> 43:34.921
I'm worth six bags.

43:53.577 --> 43:55.306
Who is the man

43:55.379 --> 43:57.973
That will risk his life
for his brother man?

43:58.049 --> 43:59.243
Shaft

43:59.317 --> 44:00.909
Come on, now.

44:00.985 --> 44:03.453
You know this cat Shaft's
a bad mother.

44:03.521 --> 44:04.715
Shut yo' mouth.

44:04.789 --> 44:07.849
- You know it's Shaft.
- Well, we can dig it.

44:08.793 --> 44:11.261
I remember Shaft.
Every guy wanted to be like him,

44:11.329 --> 44:13.320
every girl wanted to be with him.

44:13.397 --> 44:14.728
Not me.

44:14.799 --> 44:17.734
I'll bet you had an afro
and saw it about six times.

44:17.802 --> 44:19.997
No. Kyle's father
was alive and real.

44:20.071 --> 44:21.629
Shaft was just make-believe.

44:21.706 --> 44:24.106
You never make believe?

44:24.175 --> 44:26.973
You never dream of making
things in your life different?

44:28.346 --> 44:30.746
No. I dream about
my son surviving,

44:30.815 --> 44:32.282
getting a good education,

44:32.350 --> 44:34.750
and making something positive
out of his life.

44:34.819 --> 44:37.447
There's nothing else
worth dreaming about.

44:40.157 --> 44:42.352
Come on. You never
want to escape?

44:43.894 --> 44:47.455
You never just dream
about just running away?

44:47.531 --> 44:48.691
No.

44:48.766 --> 44:50.825
Even if it's just your mind
doing the running?

44:50.901 --> 44:52.300
No.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.307
What about you?

44:57.375 --> 45:00.344
Where does your mind run to?

45:00.411 --> 45:02.402
Nowhere.
It's just stuck.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.880
It's the rest of me
that does the running.

45:04.949 --> 45:06.280
That's too bad.

45:06.350 --> 45:08.978
Folks either move past the things
that happen to them,

45:09.053 --> 45:11.248
or they stop moving at all.

45:11.322 --> 45:14.849
But you're young.
You can do anything, except sing.

45:14.925 --> 45:16.256
I can sing a little bit.

45:16.327 --> 45:17.726
Not even a little bit.

45:17.795 --> 45:19.387
Who's the guy
that walks on by

45:19.463 --> 45:21.454
Who's that cat...

45:21.532 --> 45:23.898
No, no.
I can't take it!

45:23.968 --> 45:25.265
No, I can't take it!

45:33.878 --> 45:35.539
Good morning.

45:36.680 --> 45:37.806
Good morning.

45:37.882 --> 45:40.612
No, this is a hell of a fucking morning.

45:40.684 --> 45:43.209
The sun's out, birds is flying,

45:43.287 --> 45:45.881
here's my big brother on his way
to his good job.

45:45.956 --> 45:47.719
It's a great fucking morning.

45:47.792 --> 45:50.226
If you say so.

45:50.294 --> 45:53.229
If mama was still alive,
she'd say the same thing.

45:53.297 --> 45:56.425
We all so fucking proud of you.
You finally made it.

45:56.500 --> 46:01.096
Fuck college, fuck the pros.
He's a security guard.

46:01.172 --> 46:03.538
It all fucking makes sense to me now.

46:03.607 --> 46:07.304
All this time, people been telling me
Tom Sheppard is so fucking raw.

46:07.378 --> 46:09.642
Too bad he started tripping
when his friend died.

46:09.713 --> 46:12.511
He got all the talent with no heart.

46:13.350 --> 46:16.808
I'm sitting here thinking,
my brother can't be this fucking weak.

46:16.954 --> 46:19.855
But you ain't weak.

46:19.924 --> 46:21.221
Shit.

46:21.292 --> 46:23.658
You keeping our high school safe.

46:25.062 --> 46:28.031
Where the fuck are you going?
We having a family moment.

46:28.099 --> 46:29.532
Is that what we're having?

46:29.600 --> 46:32.763
Yes.
I'm still the only family you got.

46:32.837 --> 46:35.032
You may not like the man I become,

46:35.106 --> 46:36.437
but I'm still a man.

46:36.507 --> 46:39.203
You... you're a joke.

46:41.078 --> 46:43.603
Go ahead to work, though, man.

46:56.760 --> 46:57.886
Come on.

47:31.462 --> 47:34.056
Damn. It's that bad, coach?

47:36.300 --> 47:38.200
You don't have to deal with these kids.

47:38.269 --> 47:40.669
What are you doing here so late?

47:40.738 --> 47:42.262
Just about to leave.

47:42.339 --> 47:44.773
- You want a beer?
- Nah.

47:46.410 --> 47:48.344
You know...

47:48.412 --> 47:50.403
I been thinking about
that offer you made me.

47:50.481 --> 47:54.781
What offer was that?
I make a lot of offers.

47:54.852 --> 47:58.117
You know.
The one about helping you out and all.

47:58.189 --> 48:01.647
Jeez, I made a dumb offer like that?

48:01.725 --> 48:03.590
I guess not.

48:03.661 --> 48:04.992
Gotcha!

48:07.631 --> 48:09.064
Don't even think about it.

48:12.536 --> 48:14.060
Get over here!

48:16.707 --> 48:18.038
Kyle, have you seen my keys?

48:18.108 --> 48:21.566
I can't believe you're going out
with that toy cop again.

48:24.848 --> 48:28.113
I mean, what do you
even know about him?

48:28.185 --> 48:31.120
At least tell me what time
you're coming home.

48:31.188 --> 48:32.655
Look who's worried about curfews.

48:32.723 --> 48:34.122
I'm worried about you.

48:34.191 --> 48:35.658
Well, how does it feel?

48:35.726 --> 48:38.456
I was waiting up again last night.
Where were you?

48:38.529 --> 48:40.929
- Chillin'.
- That's not good enough.

48:40.998 --> 48:42.590
Do I have to ground you?

48:42.666 --> 48:44.395
You have to be home first.

48:44.468 --> 48:46.629
I can ground you from a pay phone.

48:46.704 --> 48:50.003
You ain't no cop 'cause you
knocking boots with Barney Fife.

48:50.074 --> 48:51.564
Sit your 10-cent ass down.

48:51.642 --> 48:54.008
You don't pay rent,
you don't pay bills,

48:54.078 --> 48:56.205
and you did not bring me into this world.

48:56.280 --> 48:59.681
Don't disrespect me again.
Do you understand?

48:59.750 --> 49:01.615
- But l...
- But nothing!

49:14.565 --> 49:16.726
Excuse me?

49:16.800 --> 49:19.598
You think you can just kiss me
anytime you feel like it?

49:19.670 --> 49:22.230
- Yeah, that's right.
- I guess that answers that.

49:22.306 --> 49:24.706
Come in. I'll be just a second.

49:49.066 --> 49:50.192
Flip.

49:50.267 --> 49:53.794
I'm not here to start nothing, man.

49:53.871 --> 49:56.271
I just want to ask you
about your man Tom Sheppard.

49:59.777 --> 50:01.608
What you looking for, some dick?

50:01.679 --> 50:04.170
- Look, I'm serious...
- Get your fucking hands off!

50:06.250 --> 50:07.376
I'm serious!

50:07.451 --> 50:09.009
Go ask him your goddamn self.

50:09.953 --> 50:12.148
What's up, man?
Talk to me.

50:12.222 --> 50:13.883
Come on!

50:13.957 --> 50:16.892
What you doing?
Let him go.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.018
What's up?

50:19.096 --> 50:21.087
Fuck you with your puss ass!

50:21.165 --> 50:23.360
You, too, Birdie,
old pickle-head motherfucker.

50:23.434 --> 50:25.493
- What, man?
- Birdie, no!

50:25.569 --> 50:27.560
You're flinching, right, little bitch?

50:27.638 --> 50:29.367
Huh? Buddy, what's up?

50:29.440 --> 50:30.907
Please.

50:33.577 --> 50:36.410
Put the shit away, man.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.573
We ain't trying to hurt nobody.

50:39.917 --> 50:43.318
Flip, you get your raggedy ass
from up around me.

50:46.123 --> 50:47.522
Well, fuck you, Bird.

50:47.591 --> 50:49.058
You think you all that.

50:49.126 --> 50:52.186
You ain't no fucking better than me
and nobody walking around here.

50:52.262 --> 50:55.129
Fucker came after me
about Tom Sheppard.

50:55.199 --> 50:58.930
Ask Scarface.
It's his motherfucking brother.

51:05.676 --> 51:08.668
And I'll see you later,
you cheroot-smoking motherfuck.

51:12.416 --> 51:14.941
Come on, homeboy, let's go.

51:15.018 --> 51:16.246
Birdie, is it true?

51:17.154 --> 51:19.952
I didn't come here to talk about that.

51:20.023 --> 51:22.218
You didn't come to the club
and I thought I'd see why.

51:22.292 --> 51:23.691
Is he your brother?

51:25.229 --> 51:27.220
He used to be.

51:27.297 --> 51:29.162
What does that mean?

51:29.967 --> 51:32.367
Just 'cause a motherfucker's
born into your family

51:32.436 --> 51:35.371
don't mean you stay family,
all right?

51:35.439 --> 51:36.838
That motherfucker ain't shit.

51:36.907 --> 51:41.037
He don't care about me, you, nothing.
Okay?

51:41.111 --> 51:42.169
Understand?

51:46.583 --> 51:49.711
Now go to school.
You're late.

51:56.860 --> 51:58.259
What about Flip?

51:58.328 --> 52:02.196
It's a goddamn shame
what happened to Flip.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.200
Let's get some food.
Let's get some food.

53:03.460 --> 53:06.395
Piss.
He look all peaceful and shit.

53:08.599 --> 53:10.066
Wake his ass up.

53:12.336 --> 53:13.496
Wake up.

53:15.038 --> 53:16.665
Wake up.

53:16.974 --> 53:18.134
Wake your ass up.

53:18.208 --> 53:20.904
Look here. Come on.

53:20.978 --> 53:22.002
Wake up.

53:22.913 --> 53:24.813
Fuck you, man.

53:27.951 --> 53:29.942
Recognize, motherfucker.

53:37.494 --> 53:40.429
How you going to call a walk on me?

53:40.497 --> 53:42.431
He's fouling me, man.

53:54.278 --> 53:56.508
Kyle, time-out.
Call a time-out.

53:56.580 --> 53:58.047
Time-out,
time-out.

53:59.049 --> 54:00.983
Come on, get in here.

54:01.051 --> 54:03.383
What the hell is going on
out there?

54:03.453 --> 54:05.614
You're all asleep on defense.

54:05.689 --> 54:06.849
What is this?

54:06.924 --> 54:09.859
Chuck, your guy is hanging out
whenever he wants to.

54:09.927 --> 54:11.861
You're walking around
like you're asleep.

54:11.929 --> 54:13.396
Kyle, pay attention.

54:13.463 --> 54:15.397
Get your head into the game.

54:15.465 --> 54:16.932
You're getting killed out there.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.399
Here's what we'll do.

54:18.468 --> 54:21.266
Bobby, you're on point.

54:21.338 --> 54:22.737
I'm the point, coach.

54:22.806 --> 54:24.865
Montrose has you all bottled up.

54:24.942 --> 54:26.409
This should free you.

54:26.476 --> 54:28.876
Do we all understand
what we're doing?

54:28.946 --> 54:31.540
Let's get out there and do it, huh?

54:31.615 --> 54:33.549
Starnes, block up the middle line.

54:33.617 --> 54:35.084
Get out there.

54:35.152 --> 54:37.086
Come on, let's go.

54:40.090 --> 54:41.557
What's wrong, star?

54:41.625 --> 54:43.957
Coach take the point from you?

54:46.430 --> 54:47.897
Watch those elbows!

54:53.437 --> 54:54.802
- Technical foul!
- On who?

54:54.871 --> 54:57.840
- On you.
- Watch your temper, superstar.

54:57.908 --> 55:00.138
- Don, you're in for Kyle.
- You can't take me out now.

55:00.210 --> 55:02.701
I just did.
Sit down.

55:02.779 --> 55:05.907
You didn't see that?
This is bullshit!

55:05.983 --> 55:07.917
You're out of here!

55:07.985 --> 55:10.044
You're out of here, stupid.

55:12.322 --> 55:13.983
What you looking at?

55:15.058 --> 55:17.526
You want some of this?

55:20.330 --> 55:21.729
Hey, what's wrong with you?

55:21.798 --> 55:24.790
I don't care what you say.
He fouled me.

55:24.868 --> 55:27.803
So what?
You still got to control yourself.

55:27.871 --> 55:29.736
You trying to ruin your chances?

55:29.806 --> 55:31.967
Man, they're not giving me a chance.

55:32.042 --> 55:34.272
This is my gym, and they called
a bullshit foul.

55:34.344 --> 55:36.869
They wouldn't do that shit
in his gym.

55:36.947 --> 55:38.881
Don't blame it on anybody else.

55:38.949 --> 55:40.416
You fucked it up yourself.

55:40.484 --> 55:42.952
Man, fuck you!
Fuck.

55:44.488 --> 55:46.683
What is that going to do?

55:59.970 --> 56:01.870
Fucking mess, Monroe.

56:04.641 --> 56:08.099
There was a Georgetown scout
out there, and I fucked up!

56:14.651 --> 56:16.118
It's all right.

56:16.186 --> 56:17.653
Kyle, you all right?

56:20.323 --> 56:21.722
Kyle, come on, man!

56:21.792 --> 56:23.657
Let me go!

56:25.262 --> 56:26.923
I don't want you
seeing my moms again.

56:26.997 --> 56:29.397
Your own brother says you ain't shit,
motherfucker.

56:29.466 --> 56:32.799
- You better stay away from her.
- Kyle, chill!

56:32.869 --> 56:36.202
Get off me, man.
Stay away from my moms!

56:36.273 --> 56:37.433
Or what?

56:39.176 --> 56:41.007
You going to hurt somebody?

56:41.078 --> 56:42.477
If it comes to that.

56:42.546 --> 56:44.275
You owe someone an apology.

56:44.347 --> 56:45.678
Fuck that!

56:47.584 --> 56:50.178
Who do you think you're talking to?

56:50.253 --> 56:51.743
I was protecting you.

56:51.822 --> 56:53.050
Protecting me?

56:53.123 --> 56:55.887
What the hell has gotten into you?

56:55.959 --> 56:57.824
Ask him.

57:16.947 --> 57:18.938
Some real fireworks tonight.

57:19.015 --> 57:20.312
Yeah.

57:20.383 --> 57:21.975
What are you going to do?

57:22.052 --> 57:23.451
Go home.

57:23.520 --> 57:25.147
No. I mean about Kyle.

57:25.222 --> 57:28.714
- What do you expect me to do?
- Teach him.

57:28.792 --> 57:30.657
Help him to handle the pressure.

57:30.727 --> 57:33.855
What do I know
about handling pressure?

57:35.465 --> 57:36.864
I'm out of here.

57:36.933 --> 57:39.401
You can't turn your back on this kid.

57:39.469 --> 57:40.868
You owe it to him.

57:40.937 --> 57:42.564
I owe nobody nothing.

57:44.741 --> 57:46.208
"Pure Talent, Fatal Flaw."

57:46.276 --> 57:47.675
That's what the paper said.

57:47.744 --> 57:51.180
You in handcuffs,
Nutso dead on the ground.

57:51.248 --> 57:53.512
You don't owe anybody?

57:53.583 --> 57:54.948
You forget about Nutso?

57:55.018 --> 57:57.316
Wasn't it the great Tom Sheppard

57:57.387 --> 57:59.514
he was trying to be like
when he fell?

57:59.589 --> 58:01.420
How about owing yourself?

58:01.491 --> 58:04.551
Born with all the gifts,
but you just gave up.

58:04.628 --> 58:07.358
Oh, yeah. I'd say you owe plenty.

58:07.430 --> 58:09.830
If you ever plan on giving
anything back,

58:09.900 --> 58:11.367
you better start right now.

58:11.434 --> 58:13.527
You can't do anything
about your mom or Nutso,

58:13.603 --> 58:15.594
but you can about Kyle.

58:15.672 --> 58:19.108
It's all there for him, Shep,
and he's blowing it.

58:19.176 --> 58:21.371
Well, he won't be the first.

59:20.370 --> 59:22.770
Gettin' ready for that shoot-out, fellas.

59:22.839 --> 59:23.828
Lookin' good.

59:25.108 --> 59:27.702
There you go, baby.
Back door, baby.

59:27.777 --> 59:29.711
What's up, baby?

59:29.779 --> 59:31.838
How you doin'?

59:31.915 --> 59:34.315
You my man in the hole now,

59:34.384 --> 59:36.818
but you look like a 14-karat Urkel.

59:38.488 --> 59:41.389
Let me tell you something, Kyle.
It's all about psyche, baby.

59:41.458 --> 59:44.325
You got to feel basketball.
It's in the heart.

59:44.394 --> 59:46.328
You know what I'm saying?

59:48.899 --> 59:52.835
- Hey, what's that for?
- Grip, baby.

59:52.903 --> 59:54.837
All about grip.

59:54.905 --> 59:56.338
Here we go.

59:56.406 --> 59:57.668
All right, Joe.

59:57.741 --> 01:00:00.896
I'm about to get up in your ass
like a gerbil!

01:00:00.968 --> 01:00:02.265
Here we go.

01:00:02.336 --> 01:00:03.769
Take your time.

01:00:03.838 --> 01:00:05.271
There you go.

01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:06.772
Breathe.
You're too tense.

01:00:06.841 --> 01:00:08.672
Speed it up.
Here we go.

01:00:10.644 --> 01:00:13.704
Damn!
That shit slipped, Kyle.

01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:15.214
He can hit that.

01:00:15.282 --> 01:00:17.773
Here we go.
Yeah, boy.

01:00:17.852 --> 01:00:19.183
All right.
Here we go.

01:00:19.253 --> 01:00:20.311
Run it back.

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:22.548
Run it back right now.

01:00:23.591 --> 01:00:24.888
Run in place!

01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:49.215
How high can you get, Nutso?

01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:52.275
How high can you get, boy?
Come on.

01:00:53.787 --> 01:00:56.881
Shit, not even Nutso
ever got that high.

01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:58.720
Least not playin'.

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:01.226
Don't stop.
Keep goin'.

01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:04.661
That is who you was playin', right?

01:01:04.732 --> 01:01:08.668
I remember watchin' you two
go at it for hours.

01:01:09.737 --> 01:01:11.295
What do you want from me?

01:01:11.372 --> 01:01:13.840
Want to put my arm
around your shoulder?

01:01:13.908 --> 01:01:15.239
Help you with your homework?

01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:18.244
Pat your ass and say you done good?

01:01:18.312 --> 01:01:20.712
What the fuck do you want from me?

01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:24.649
Just heard you was leavin'.
Came to tell you goodbye.

01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:27.184
You don't want mom's dessert.

01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:29.654
You don't do it,
you get no dessert.

01:01:29.723 --> 01:01:31.190
I'm going to tell.

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:33.658
Come on.
Take your time and shoot.

01:01:33.727 --> 01:01:35.661
There you go.
One more time.

01:01:35.729 --> 01:01:38.289
Mom's dessert's gonna look
so good on that plate.

01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:43.202
Snap your wrists.
Take your time.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.738
I never did get that right.

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:51.744
It's funny what you
do pick up, though.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.888
One more.
Take one more.

01:02:08.963 --> 01:02:10.692
Make it.
There you go.

01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:15.701
See what happens
when you snap your wrists?

01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:18.761
There you go, Ronnie.
One more time.

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:38.190
How you doin'?

01:02:38.258 --> 01:02:39.725
Fine.

01:02:42.596 --> 01:02:44.188
I'm leavin' town tomorrow.

01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:46.198
I thought you should know.

01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:49.201
Just wanted to talk
to you and Kyle.

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:51.669
Talk about what?

01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:53.673
Clear things up.

01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:56.209
Explain about the past.

01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:58.210
Kyle's not here.

01:02:58.278 --> 01:02:59.677
What about you?

01:02:59.747 --> 01:03:01.772
Doesn't matter to me.

01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:04.249
I can't worry about your past.

01:03:04.318 --> 01:03:05.717
I care about Kyle

01:03:05.786 --> 01:03:08.254
and how you walked out
of that locker room.

01:03:08.322 --> 01:03:12.190
Kyle was upset, I was confused,
and you just ran out.

01:03:13.394 --> 01:03:15.055
You're a runner, Thomas.

01:03:15.129 --> 01:03:18.530
I just don't have
enough time for that.

01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:21.825
Good night.

01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:43.755
Okay, okay, settle down.

01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:48.251
We got us a new player on the team.

01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:49.761
He's wet behind the ears,

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.765
but with everybody's help,
he'll be all right.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.768
This is our new Birdman,
our point, Kyle.

01:03:55.836 --> 01:03:57.770
What's up?
Championship, baby.

01:03:57.838 --> 01:03:59.305
Be doin' things like my man.

01:03:59.373 --> 01:04:00.772
Take care of him.

01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:03.708
You don't tell a brother
you're havin' a team meeting?

01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:05.711
Oh, shit.
Y'all have uniforms?

01:04:05.779 --> 01:04:08.714
Damn! I hope nobody
got my number.

01:04:08.782 --> 01:04:12.309
Hey, black Lurch,
they find a pair of shoes to fit you?

01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:14.286
You rang?

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:15.787
What's up?
Sorry I'm late, B.

01:04:15.856 --> 01:04:18.120
Niggers didn't tell me
about the meeting.

01:04:18.192 --> 01:04:20.126
Where my uniform at, B?

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:22.492
Shit. Uniforms is for players only.

01:04:22.563 --> 01:04:25.259
Hey, I'm a player.
You know me.

01:04:25.332 --> 01:04:28.130
Fuck, you're a player in
the wheelchair league.

01:04:30.304 --> 01:04:34.001
Kyle, tell him me and you
been workin' on my game.

01:04:34.074 --> 01:04:35.666
Tell him we goin'
to play college ball.

01:04:35.742 --> 01:04:37.733
Nigger, you can't barely fuckin' read.

01:04:37.811 --> 01:04:39.278
How you goin' to college?

01:04:39.346 --> 01:04:40.745
Is this a fuckin' joke?

01:04:40.814 --> 01:04:43.282
Somebody tell me this
is a fuckin' joke.

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:46.342
Tell me, somebody.
Is it a joke?

01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:50.750
Yeah, nigger.
Go on. I got you.

01:04:50.824 --> 01:04:53.292
Come on, B.
You know I be playin' around.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.555
- That's what I fuckin' thought.
- College ball.

01:04:55.629 --> 01:04:57.392
We havin' a team meeting.

01:04:57.464 --> 01:05:01.230
Get the fuck out
so we can handle our business.

01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:04.236
So where we goin',
Jamaica, Las Vegas?

01:05:04.304 --> 01:05:07.102
We got to...
Nigger, get the fuck out.

01:05:07.174 --> 01:05:10.075
Am I stutterin'?
Get the fuck out!

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:18.784
Where we goin',
Jamaica, Vegas?

01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:20.376
Where we at?

01:05:20.454 --> 01:05:22.718
Hey, Bug, you all right?

01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:24.723
I'm straight, kid,
I'm straight.

01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:27.658
Birdie had no right
to dis you like that.

01:05:27.728 --> 01:05:29.195
Birdie's just being Birdie.

01:05:29.263 --> 01:05:31.197
You should've said something to him.

01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:32.664
Kyle... leave it.

01:05:32.733 --> 01:05:35.201
I'm serious.
Stand up for yourself.

01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:39.205
All right.
So I'll just talk shit back to him

01:05:39.273 --> 01:05:41.673
and wind up like that bum Flip.

01:05:41.742 --> 01:05:43.209
What you talkin' about?

01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:44.676
What, you don't know?

01:05:44.745 --> 01:05:47.612
That nigger sliced Flip up
for no reason.

01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:48.670
Just...

01:05:48.749 --> 01:05:52.685
He didn't even do shit.
And look what happened to him.

01:05:52.753 --> 01:05:55.745
What the fuck he gonna do to me?

01:05:58.759 --> 01:06:00.693
You all right?

01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:03.286
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Sure?

01:06:03.363 --> 01:06:06.161
Yo, I'll catch you later, all right?

01:06:06.233 --> 01:06:07.632
Yo, Kyle.

01:06:12.306 --> 01:06:13.295
Flip!

01:06:15.776 --> 01:06:17.767
Flip Johnson!

01:06:25.319 --> 01:06:27.947
Yo, Flip, I just wanna know
if you're here, man!

01:06:29.122 --> 01:06:30.987
I ain't gonna mess with you, Flip!

01:06:31.058 --> 01:06:33.253
I'm all by myself, man!

01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:38.258
Come on out, Flip!

01:06:39.733 --> 01:06:41.257
It's me, man!

01:06:42.736 --> 01:06:44.670
He's gone.

01:06:45.739 --> 01:06:47.206
What the hell are you doin' here?

01:06:47.274 --> 01:06:48.673
Lookin' for you.

01:06:48.742 --> 01:06:50.209
Where's Flip?

01:06:50.277 --> 01:06:51.676
He's gone.

01:06:51.745 --> 01:06:55.203
He's probably around here
gettin' high or some shit.

01:06:55.282 --> 01:06:57.409
He's dead.

01:06:59.419 --> 01:07:02.183
It's time you and me played.

01:07:02.256 --> 01:07:05.225
Fuck you.
Why don't you play yourself?

01:07:07.227 --> 01:07:08.694
Come on, tough guy.

01:07:10.764 --> 01:07:13.699
Let me see what you got.

01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:16.291
Come on!

01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:22.302
Just like I thought.
You ain't nothin' but a pussy.

01:07:23.777 --> 01:07:26.109
- Let's go.
- First basket wins.

01:07:26.179 --> 01:07:27.908
Winner gets boonks.
Deal?

01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:31.246
All you gotta do is score, Kyle.

01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:35.646
Is it a deal?

01:07:36.456 --> 01:07:39.721
- It's a deal.
- Let's go.

01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:50.532
I ain't Flip.

01:07:58.745 --> 01:08:00.679
Damn, that's a weak crossover.

01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:03.682
I know you can do better than that.

01:08:05.686 --> 01:08:07.153
Takin' off his coat.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.687
I'm scared.

01:08:18.631 --> 01:08:21.294
Georgetown? I don't think so.

01:08:24.837 --> 01:08:26.237
Show me something,

01:08:26.305 --> 01:08:29.173
and don't let it be
that weak-ass jumper of yours.

01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:38.250
How 'bout some boonks?

01:08:38.318 --> 01:08:42.720
How 'bout some crazy, hard,
scar-your-motherfuckin'-ass boonks?

01:08:44.191 --> 01:08:46.125
What, is there a problem, Kyle?

01:08:46.193 --> 01:08:49.252
Isn't that what you
wanted to give Flip?

01:08:49.328 --> 01:08:52.787
- No problem.
- Then bend your ass over.

01:09:09.816 --> 01:09:11.750
I lost. I owe you.

01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:13.886
You owe me?

01:09:13.953 --> 01:09:15.819
That's right. I owe you.

01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:18.756
You hear that, Nutso?

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:21.350
The boy here says he owes me.

01:09:21.428 --> 01:09:24.693
He owes me!

01:09:24.765 --> 01:09:26.528
Are we even?

01:09:27.567 --> 01:09:29.228
Are we even?

01:09:32.773 --> 01:09:36.004
You don't owe me nothing.
You owe yourself

01:09:36.076 --> 01:09:38.636
and the ones that
cared enough to get you here.

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:43.206
Believe me, I know.

01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:53.725
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:53.794 --> 01:09:57.730
Welcome to the fifth annual
Uptown Shoot-out.

01:09:57.798 --> 01:10:00.266
This is a round-robin tournament.

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:04.599
Games consist of two 20-minute halves
with a continuous clock.

01:10:04.671 --> 01:10:07.333
Halftime is five minutes,
with play resuming immediately.

01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:09.773
Teams have one time-out per half.

01:10:09.843 --> 01:10:12.073
Other than that,
the action will never stop.

01:10:12.145 --> 01:10:16.548
The two teams with the best record
out of their respective groupings

01:10:16.616 --> 01:10:20.814
will play for all the marbles
in the Uptown Championship.

01:11:05.198 --> 01:11:07.325
All officials,
please report to courtside.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.734
Please report to courtside, all officials.
Five-minute warning.

01:11:11.805 --> 01:11:16.174
This is your five-minute warning.
Clear the court.

01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:23.346
So my time ain't money, huh?

01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:26.214
I see you finally decided to join us.

01:11:26.286 --> 01:11:28.220
Get dressed.

01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:30.222
It's all in there, Birdie...

01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:32.281
the money, the shoes, everything.

01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:34.691
I don't need your kind of help.

01:11:34.761 --> 01:11:36.888
I'm not runnin' with you anymore.

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.163
You don't have no choice.

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.769
You're right. I don't.

01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.501
It ain't over.

01:11:51.244 --> 01:11:53.838
Motaw, you start.

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:57.249
You, your ass is gone.

01:11:57.317 --> 01:12:00.718
I catch anybody talkin' to Bugaloo,
and your ass is gone, too.

01:12:00.787 --> 01:12:02.652
Now, I want this motherfuckin' game.

01:12:02.722 --> 01:12:04.713
If y'all can't give it to me, leave now!

01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:06.452
Are y'all players, or what?

01:12:06.526 --> 01:12:08.721
Let's get this shit together.

01:12:08.795 --> 01:12:11.263
We could definitely win this thing.

01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:12.730
Bombers, Bombers, Bombers,
championship...

01:12:12.799 --> 01:12:15.267
long as y'all give me the rock.

01:12:15.335 --> 01:12:16.734
Hey, kid, pay attention.

01:12:16.803 --> 01:12:20.261
You might learn a thing or two.
Ain't that right, coach?

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.274
Tyrone, are you about done?

01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.742
Coach, relax.
Just give me the rock.

01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:26.745
I'm about to get my swerve on.

01:12:26.813 --> 01:12:29.407
- Good morning, coach.
- Kyle.

01:12:29.482 --> 01:12:32.212
I was wondering if you
needed anybody today.

01:12:32.285 --> 01:12:35.220
Yeah, I just might
need another guard.

01:12:35.288 --> 01:12:38.223
Guard? Coach, I'm all
the guard you need.

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:41.419
Man, get to the back of the bus.

01:13:16.863 --> 01:13:19.855
Motherfuckers gonna think twice
before they come inside.

01:14:22.862 --> 01:14:25.729
This came to the office
for you yesterday.

01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:28.165
- What?
- It's just a letter.

01:14:28.968 --> 01:14:31.732
- A letter from where?
- Georgetown.

01:16:14.507 --> 01:16:16.975
I've been waiting for this moment.

01:17:03.823 --> 01:17:07.691
Y'all go on. I'll be right back.
I got to get my bag.

01:17:08.528 --> 01:17:09.825
Good luck there, superstar.

01:17:11.831 --> 01:17:13.822
I said good luck.

01:17:15.835 --> 01:17:17.234
That's not very polite.

01:17:17.303 --> 01:17:20.761
I wish you good luck,
you don't wish it back to me?

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.307
That's damn near rude.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:26.238
- Good luck, Birdie.
- Thanks a lot.

01:17:27.714 --> 01:17:28.703
Almost forgot.

01:17:28.781 --> 01:17:32.182
Heard you're a Hoya now.
Congratulations.

01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:35.384
What you think they'll think up
in Georgetown

01:17:35.455 --> 01:17:37.013
about the presents you took?

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:41.191
Check this out.

01:17:41.261 --> 01:17:44.059
You're not going to college
or any-fucking-where

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:46.189
if the Birdmen don't win.

01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:50.197
You might be on another team,
but you're playing for me, Kyle.

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:51.737
You remember that.

01:17:51.804 --> 01:17:53.135
Good game.

01:18:32.312 --> 01:18:33.711
After that, it's cool.

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.272
You can call me after about 3:00.
Hold on.

01:18:38.017 --> 01:18:41.475
Don't forget you still
playin' for me, homey.

01:18:41.554 --> 01:18:43.249
Yeah.

01:18:43.323 --> 01:18:46.781
Just a small problem we got down here.

01:19:16.956 --> 01:19:18.617
There you go, baby!

01:19:23.363 --> 01:19:25.228
You said no defense, brother.

01:19:25.298 --> 01:19:28.165
No defense.
You know the rules.

01:19:36.909 --> 01:19:39.173
Come on, ref.
Make the call, man.

01:19:52.058 --> 01:19:56.188
Come on, baby!
Do your thing!

01:19:58.331 --> 01:20:01.266
Where's your heart at?
I don't see no heart!

01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:02.995
Get in the game, man!

01:20:03.069 --> 01:20:04.661
Pressure! Pressure!

01:20:19.519 --> 01:20:21.714
This boy ain't got it.

01:20:29.328 --> 01:20:31.296
Get your shit together, man!

01:20:53.319 --> 01:20:54.718
Pressure!
Pressure!

01:20:54.787 --> 01:20:57.255
Let's go! Bring it back!
Come on!

01:21:04.564 --> 01:21:06.794
You like that, baby?
We teammates, right?

01:21:08.968 --> 01:21:11.835
Come on! Right in there,
get your spot.

01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:22.040
Boo-yah!
Look at that shit!

01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:28.186
Bobby, you're in.

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:36.387
So what is it like sucking Birdie's dick?

01:21:58.951 --> 01:22:01.476
No! Bank it!
You ain't got nothin'!

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:28.842
Yeah! Hell, Yeah!

01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:31.912
Come on, come on, baby!

01:22:36.923 --> 01:22:38.356
Come on, guys, watch it!

01:22:39.492 --> 01:22:41.050
What's going on?

01:22:44.397 --> 01:22:47.025
Okay, Bobby.
All right, now. Come on.

01:22:49.101 --> 01:22:50.398
Easy, now.

01:22:55.942 --> 01:22:57.341
Is he crying?

01:22:57.410 --> 01:23:00.868
Drag this bitch off to the side
with the other bitches.

01:23:00.947 --> 01:23:01.936
He's crying.

01:23:02.014 --> 01:23:04.278
What's up, old man?
You got a problem?

01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.147
You got a problem?

01:23:06.219 --> 01:23:07.948
Take his ass to the side!

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.418
- How's your ankle?
- It'll be all right.

01:23:20.433 --> 01:23:22.367
Kyle! Kyle!

01:23:31.911 --> 01:23:35.210
Bitch, want me to twist
your other ankle?

01:23:35.281 --> 01:23:36.305
What's up?

01:23:40.052 --> 01:23:42.520
What the fuck are y'all doing?
Come on, man!

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:04.541
Time-out!
Where's the goddamn foul?

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:06.009
There was no foul.

01:24:06.078 --> 01:24:07.204
Stop complaining!

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.408
This here's a man's game, am I right?

01:24:11.417 --> 01:24:13.442
Good no-call, ref!

01:24:13.519 --> 01:24:15.350
Get him up from here.

01:24:15.421 --> 01:24:17.412
- Be careful.
- Come on.

01:24:22.695 --> 01:24:25.061
Let's keep this baby rollin'!

01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:27.298
Coach, let's go.
The time-out's over.

01:24:27.366 --> 01:24:29.300
Got to send your team out now.

01:24:29.368 --> 01:24:30.562
Let's go, guys.

01:24:36.909 --> 01:24:39.309
That's only four.
You need one more.

01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:42.108
You need one more player, coach.
Let's go.

01:24:42.181 --> 01:24:44.479
Put me in, coach.

01:24:53.926 --> 01:24:55.393
Tommy Sheppard.

01:24:58.397 --> 01:25:01.264
Hold up! What is this shit?

01:25:01.367 --> 01:25:03.028
He ain't on the team.

01:25:03.102 --> 01:25:04.797
He's on my original roster.

01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:08.271
- He ain't even in fucking uniform.
- He is now.

01:25:08.341 --> 01:25:11.333
- He ain't been playing.
- That doesn't matter.

01:25:12.345 --> 01:25:15.337
This is fucking bullshit, man!
You know this is bullshit!

01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:18.406
Pull that stunt one more time,
your team's gone.

01:25:18.484 --> 01:25:21.351
This is Tom Sheppard.
This is like seeing a ghost!

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:24.184
Hey, fuck him up.
Fuck him up!

01:25:35.701 --> 01:25:38.670
- What was that?
- What's up, man?

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.904
Come on!

01:26:08.134 --> 01:26:10.329
On your ass, motherfucker!

01:26:12.138 --> 01:26:13.730
Look at this!

01:26:16.442 --> 01:26:19.309
Why are you doin' this?
It's only a game.

01:26:20.212 --> 01:26:22.806
Not to me. Come on.

01:26:23.416 --> 01:26:26.044
He's gonna play.
He's all right, folks.

01:26:26.118 --> 01:26:27.278
Here we go.

01:26:33.826 --> 01:26:36.158
Don't worry about it! Come on!

01:26:41.567 --> 01:26:42.625
What's that?

01:26:42.701 --> 01:26:45.636
What's the fuck is that?
Take him out of the game!

01:26:45.704 --> 01:26:47.296
You got to be kidding me.

01:26:47.373 --> 01:26:51.571
This here's a man's game.
Good no-call, ref!

01:26:51.644 --> 01:26:54.579
Motaw, come on!
Don't lose this for me!

01:27:13.399 --> 01:27:14.866
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:27:18.003 --> 01:27:19.527
Hell, yeah!

01:27:52.238 --> 01:27:53.899
God fuckin' damn!

01:28:05.851 --> 01:28:07.079
Goddamn!

01:28:10.389 --> 01:28:12.857
All Motaw has to do
is hang on to that ball,

01:28:12.925 --> 01:28:16.793
and the Birdmen will hang
on to that championship!

01:28:19.865 --> 01:28:21.594
Let's go! Put it back!

01:28:23.602 --> 01:28:25.399
Keep out of his butt!

01:28:26.672 --> 01:28:27.866
Run, you sucker!

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:31.876
Don't lose that fuckin' ball!
Don't lose this shit!

01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:39.081
Go, boy, go!

01:29:25.931 --> 01:29:27.330
Straighten these motherfuckers out.

01:29:27.399 --> 01:29:30.232
Handle your business!

01:30:02.534 --> 01:30:04.058
Freeze, police!

01:31:11.437 --> 01:31:14.372
Welcome back once again
to Landover, Maryland.

01:31:16.275 --> 01:31:18.368
The Hoyas of Georgetown
down by a couple to Seton Hall

01:31:18.444 --> 01:31:19.911
in the conference championship game.

01:31:19.978 --> 01:31:21.912
Only nine seconds remaining now.

01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.915
Let's explore the options
for head coach John Thompson.

01:31:24.983 --> 01:31:29.113
He can take it down low,
a high-percentage play.

01:31:29.188 --> 01:31:32.851
Maybe he'll get to the free-throw line
and send it into overtime.

01:31:32.925 --> 01:31:36.861
But Kyle Watson's had the hot hand
for the second half.

01:31:36.929 --> 01:31:40.865
Will he go to Watson
and bomb away for the outside?

01:31:40.933 --> 01:31:45.870
Nine seconds left.
Watson the lead guard for the Hoyas.

01:31:45.938 --> 01:31:48.873
Who will be the man to get it?

01:31:48.941 --> 01:31:50.875
Watson with the ball.

01:31:50.943 --> 01:31:52.877
Gives it up. They better hurry.

01:31:52.945 --> 01:31:54.412
Better make a decision.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.347
They find Watson on the wing.
Three for three! Yes!

01:31:57.416 --> 01:32:00.943
Georgetown does it!
Watson coming through!

01:32:03.489 --> 01:32:07.220
A conference championship
for the Georgetown Hoyas.

01:32:08.694 --> 01:32:13.324
Another for John Thompson.
And mayhem in Landover.

01:32:14.199 --> 01:32:18.363
And with good reason.
The play worked to perfection.

01:32:18.437 --> 01:32:20.371
The pick and the low block.

01:32:20.439 --> 01:32:23.431
Watson coming around,
finding the necessary spacing,

01:32:23.509 --> 01:32:24.908
and look at the rotation.

01:32:24.977 --> 01:32:27.844
The perfect form on the 3-point play.

01:32:27.913 --> 01:32:32.316
Downstairs, he comes free
and finds that necessary spacing.

01:32:32.384 --> 01:32:36.844
What a great deal of momentum now
for John Thompson's Georgetown Hoyas

01:32:36.922 --> 01:32:41.382
as they get ready for the Big Dance,
the NCAA Tournament.

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.860
Watson asked for the ball.
He got it.

01:32:43.929 --> 01:32:46.227
Now he's downstairs with our Bill Raff.

01:32:47.599 --> 01:32:51.035
- Got to feel pretty good, huh, Kyle?
- Great!

01:32:51.103 --> 01:32:53.901
What were you thinking of
when you made that shot?

01:32:53.972 --> 01:32:57.339
Just thinking about spreading my fingers
and popping my wrist.

01:32:57.409 --> 01:33:00.810
You didn't want to go back
into that huddle.

01:33:00.879 --> 01:33:03.211
No. He's a big man.

01:33:03.282 --> 01:33:06.410
Kept you scared. All right, Kyle.
Congratulations.
