<c.speakerTop>Princess Elena!

01:10.625 --> 01:11.625
<c.speakerTop>Is she... ?

01:11.625 --> 01:13.583
<c.speakerTop>Alive. Barely.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.125
<c.speakerTop>Wait! Where
are you taking her?!

01:15.125 --> 01:16.500
<c.speakerTop>To the <i>milagras! </i>

01:16.500 --> 01:18.958
<c.speakerTop>[whinnies]
The <i>milagras?! </i>

01:18.958 --> 01:20.583
<c.speakerTop>You can't do that!

01:20.583 --> 01:21.833

<c.speaker>[grunting]

01:30.125 --> 01:32.166
<c.speaker>Marzel!
She's over there!

01:32.166 --> 01:34.458
<c.speaker>What are you doing?!
You're turning her
into a sirena?!

01:34.458 --> 01:36.875
<c.speaker>No! If I just
wrap her chest,

01:36.875 --> 01:39.208
<c.speaker>maybe she'll breathe,
but not turn.

01:39.208 --> 01:40.875
<c.speaker>That's a big maybe.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.458
<c.speaker>Are you forgetting
she set us up?!

01:42.458 --> 01:45.875
<c.speaker>Are you forgetting
she tried to save us? Twice?!

01:47.875 --> 01:49.375
<c.speaker>Please work. Please...

01:58.958 --> 01:59.958
<c.speaker>[gasp]

01:59.958 --> 02:01.625
<c.speaker>[coughs]

02:03.458 --> 02:04.500
<c.speaker>Marisa?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.291
<c.speaker>[sigh of relief]

02:06.291 --> 02:08.000
<c.speaker>Where are we?

02:15.125 --> 02:17.083
<c.speaker>But how am I--

02:17.083 --> 02:18.583
<c.speaker>The <i>milagra. </i>

02:18.583 --> 02:21.125
<c.speaker>It lets you breathe
underwater.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.750
<c.speaker>What are you even
doing down here?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.291
<c.speaker>I was attacked.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.166
<c.speaker>By who?

02:26.166 --> 02:28.958
<c.speaker>The sorceress
who killed my parents

02:28.958 --> 02:31.000
<c.speaker>and is trying
to take over my kingdom.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.166
<c.speaker>I have to go back.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.125
<c.speaker>Wait! Let us help you.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.000
<c.speaker>-What?!
-What?!

02:36.000 --> 02:38.083
<c.speaker>Marzel,
this is our chance

02:38.083 --> 02:40.125
<c.speaker>to prove to the humans
that the sirenas
have changed.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.125
<c.speaker>Papá will never go for it.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.000
<c.speaker>He has to.
Elena needs us.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.083
<c.speaker>Her whole kingdom does.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.833
<c.speaker>This isn't our fight.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.250
<c.speaker>It is now.
Come with me!

02:53.875 --> 02:55.583
<c.speaker>Ugh! I lost Victor.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.291
<c.speaker>Same with Carla.

02:57.291 --> 02:59.083
<c.speaker>It's like she just
vanished in the crowd.

02:59.083 --> 03:03.375
<c.speaker>Uh, guys. Where's
the princesa's float?

03:03.375 --> 03:05.625
<c.speaker>Spread out and search
all the side canals. Now!

03:11.125 --> 03:14.000
<c.speaker>I told you to stay away
from the humans.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.750
<c.speaker>But instead,
you bring one to Coronado!

03:15.750 --> 03:18.166
<c.speaker>And their princess at that.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.833
<c.speaker>This will surely lead
to retaliation.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.000
<c.speaker>Surely!

03:23.000 --> 03:25.458
<c.speaker>Retaliation?
For saving me?

03:25.458 --> 03:27.000
<c.speaker>They'll give you a medal.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.583
<c.speaker>And if sirenas
help defeat Shuriki,

03:28.583 --> 03:31.958
<c.speaker>then every human in Avalor
will see that you're our allies.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.083
<c.speaker>Our friends.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.166
<c.speaker>Humans will never
be our friends.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.500
<c.speaker>But, Papá!

03:36.500 --> 03:38.333
<c.speaker>You should know
better than anyone, Marisa.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.416
<c.speaker>After they
almost took you from us.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.333
<c.speaker>What are you
talking about?

03:44.333 --> 03:47.291
<c.speaker>She doesn't remember,
Pescoro.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.333
<c.speaker>Well, perhaps
it's time she did.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.250
<c.speaker>It had been years
since we stopped sinking
the humans ships,

03:54.250 --> 03:57.458
<c.speaker>and you, my darling,
wanted to see the shore.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.750
<c.speaker>[seagulls calling]

03:59.750 --> 04:02.000
<c.speaker>[giggling]

04:03.875 --> 04:07.083
<c.speaker>Marisita, don't get
too close to the shore!

04:07.083 --> 04:09.458
<c.speaker>[giggling]

04:09.458 --> 04:10.583
<c.speaker>-[calling]
-Oh!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.208
<c.speaker>-[gasps]
-How did she do that?

04:15.208 --> 04:17.416
<c.speaker>I don't know.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.458
<c.speaker>Mami! Papi! Look at me!

04:22.458 --> 04:24.500
<c.speaker>[giggles]

04:24.500 --> 04:26.000
<c.speaker>Whoops!

04:26.000 --> 04:27.875
<c.speaker>[laughing]

04:27.875 --> 04:29.458
<c.speaker>[man grunting]

04:29.458 --> 04:31.708
<c.speaker>-Come back, <i>mija!  </i>
-Marisa!

04:31.708 --> 04:34.083
<c.speaker>Hey, those sirenas
are trying to lure that girl!

04:34.083 --> 04:36.583
<c.speaker>-[giggling]
-I'll save her!

04:36.583 --> 04:38.000
<c.speaker>[giggling]

04:38.000 --> 04:39.416
<c.speaker>-Gotcha!
-Papi!

04:39.416 --> 04:40.708
<c.speaker>-[gasp]
<i>-Mija! </i>

04:40.708 --> 04:42.250
<c.speaker>[man grunts]

04:48.250 --> 04:52.208
<c.speaker>That day, I realized humans
will always despise us,

04:52.208 --> 04:56.000
<c.speaker>and I decreed
that sirenas must never
approach them again.

05:02.125 --> 05:05.583
<c.speaker>Oh, Papá. I understand.

05:05.583 --> 05:08.708
<c.speaker>But they didn't know
who I was or what I was.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.833
<c.speaker>And they didn't know
we're different now.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.166
<c.speaker>So perhaps
it's time they did.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.250
<c.speaker>Marisa's right.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.708
<c.speaker>You want to show
the human world

05:21.708 --> 05:24.125
<c.speaker>you're no longer
our enemies?

05:24.125 --> 05:25.875

<c.speaker>Not this time.
Because you and I

08:21.875 --> 08:24.208

before she can. Come on.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.000
<c.speaker>That parade
was so much fun!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.166
<c.speaker>I wish we could do it again!

<c.speaker>Me, too, <i>mija. </i>

08:34.500 --> 08:36.458
<c.speaker>We all have
a lot to celebrate,

08:37.500 --> 08:39.250
<c.speaker>Where is Elena?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.583
<c.speaker>I haven't seen her
since we boarded the floats.

08:41.583 --> 08:45.166
<c.speaker>She's probably
still out there enjoying
the adulation of her people.

08:45.166 --> 08:47.458
<c.speaker>I know that is
what I would be doing.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.375
<c.speaker>[rumbling]

08:54.083 --> 08:55.958
<c.speaker>-[gasp] Shuriki?!
-No!

08:55.958 --> 08:59.458
<c.speaker>The real Queen of Avalor
is back!

08:59.458 --> 09:01.583
<c.speaker>And since I'm
in such a good mood,

09:01.583 --> 09:05.083
<c.speaker>I'll simply lock you up
in the tower... for now.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.250
<c.speaker>This is
how we found the float.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.625
<c.speaker>And the Crown Princess?

09:12.625 --> 09:13.708
<c.speaker>Nowhere in sight.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.500
<c.speaker>Duke Cristóbal! Huh.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.000
<c.speaker>Elena's scepter.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.708
<c.speaker>Oh, there's my cousin.

09:20.708 --> 09:23.166
<c.speaker>Wait here. Cristóbal!

09:23.166 --> 09:24.333
<c.speaker>Elena?!

09:24.333 --> 09:25.500
<c.speaker>You found my scepter.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.208
<c.speaker>-Who did this?
-Shuriki.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.291
<c.speaker>But don't worry.
I'll stop her.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.583
<c.speaker>[gasp]

09:36.875 --> 09:38.166
<c.speaker>[laughing]

09:38.166 --> 09:40.000
<c.speaker>I have other plans.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.750
<c.speaker>-[gasp]
-Guards!

09:41.750 --> 09:43.208
<c.speaker>[gasp]

09:43.208 --> 09:45.208
<c.speaker>Cristóbal?
What are you doing?

09:45.208 --> 09:46.583
<c.speaker>Oh, It's simple, really.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.000
<c.speaker>When Shuriki ruled Avalor,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.291
<c.speaker>she gave me gold
in return for my loyalty.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.875
<c.speaker>But when you
got rid of her,

09:52.875 --> 09:55.875
<c.speaker>you also got rid
of my gold supply.

09:55.875 --> 09:59.291
<c.speaker>Now I have just one yacht,
and look at me,

09:59.291 --> 10:00.500
<c.speaker>practically wasting away.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.083
<c.speaker>Luckily for me,
Shuriki returned,

10:04.083 --> 10:07.250
<c.speaker>and together,
we hatched this lovely plan

10:07.250 --> 10:11.000
<c.speaker>to restore Avalor, and me,
to our former glory.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.708
<c.speaker>You betrayed
your own <i>familia </i>for gold?

10:14.708 --> 10:18.125
<c.speaker>"Betrayed" is
such a nasty word.

10:18.125 --> 10:21.250
<c.speaker>I prefer, mmm...

10:21.250 --> 10:23.083
<c.speaker>No, you're right.
"Betrayed" works.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.458
<c.speaker>And we are talking
about a lot of gold.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.875
<c.speaker>[snap]

10:26.875 --> 10:28.083
<c.speaker>-[grunts]
-[Marisa] Get away from her!

10:31.166 --> 10:32.833
<c.speaker>Let her go!

10:32.833 --> 10:33.958
<c.speaker>-Unh!
-[guards groan]

10:36.000 --> 10:38.333
<c.speaker>[both gasp]

10:38.333 --> 10:41.166
<c.speaker>Take Princess Elena
to the palace
for her own safety.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.083
<c.speaker>And lock up that sirena!

10:46.583 --> 10:47.958
<c.speaker>Marisa!

10:49.708 --> 10:51.000
<c.speaker>Marzel, you're outnumbered.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
<c.speaker>You'll just get
yourself caught, too.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.250
<c.speaker>We gotta go tell the king!

11:05.458 --> 11:07.333
<c.speaker>[Luna]
Princess Elena!

11:07.333 --> 11:08.708
<c.speaker>Cristóbal's with Shuriki!

11:08.708 --> 11:10.125
<c.speaker>He's taking us prisoner!

11:10.125 --> 11:11.333
<c.speaker>-What?!
-Prisoner?!

11:11.333 --> 11:13.166
<c.speaker>Not on my watch!

11:14.166 --> 11:16.375
<c.speaker>Oh! Get them!

11:16.375 --> 11:18.000
<c.speaker>No! Naomi!

11:18.000 --> 11:19.416

11:19.416 --> 11:21.333
<c.speaker>-[Luna grunts]
-Whoa! Look out!

11:24.333 --> 11:27.166
<c.speaker>We need to find
Gabe and Mateo now!

11:29.708 --> 11:30.708
<c.speaker>[gasping]

11:30.708 --> 11:31.708
<c.speaker>Elena!

11:31.708 --> 11:33.208
<c.speaker>Shuriki's in the palace!

11:33.208 --> 11:35.083
<c.speaker>Of course she is.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.125
<c.speaker>Who do you think invited her?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.125
<c.speaker>[family gasping]

11:38.125 --> 11:39.291
<c.speaker>He's on her side.

11:39.291 --> 11:42.166
<c.speaker>-That scoundrel!
-What?!

11:42.166 --> 11:44.958
<c.speaker>So the Duke and Shuriki
are in this together?

11:44.958 --> 11:46.333
<c.speaker>We have to warn
the Royal Family.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.708
<c.speaker>They're back
at the palace.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.875
<c.speaker>Then it's up to us
to rescue them.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.125
<c.speaker>And I think I know
where to start looking.

11:54.833 --> 11:57.833
<c.speaker>Hmm.
The throne suits you.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.458
<c.speaker>Every throne does!

11:59.458 --> 12:01.875
<c.speaker>That's what
I was going to say.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.250
<c.speaker>Bravo! Bravo!

12:04.250 --> 12:07.833
<c.speaker>You did it!
You pulled it off!

12:07.833 --> 12:09.208
<c.speaker>Well, almost.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.708
<c.speaker>Almost?

12:10.708 --> 12:14.625
<c.speaker>Elena survived
your little surprise attack.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.083
<c.speaker>-What?!
-Not to worry.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.000
<c.speaker>I scooped her up.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
<c.speaker>Where is she?!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.166
<c.speaker>[grunting]

12:21.166 --> 12:22.125
<c.speaker>Ay, forget it, Elena!

12:22.125 --> 12:23.208
<c.speaker>It's useless!

12:23.208 --> 12:24.416
<c.speaker>There's no way
out of here!

12:24.416 --> 12:25.958
<c.speaker>-[crash]
-Aah!

12:27.875 --> 12:29.208
<c.speaker>You were saying?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.583
<c.speaker>What was that?

20:28.750 --> 20:31.000
<c.speaker>[purring]

20:45.250 --> 20:46.708
<c.speaker>I don't know
what happened to them.

20:46.708 --> 20:48.291
<c.speaker>I say we make
a break for it.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.750
<c.speaker>[clink, orb rolling]

20:55.708 --> 20:58.500
<c.speaker>That is all
that's left of Shuriki.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.000
<c.speaker>That is more than enough.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.708
<c.speaker>[laughing]

21:04.708 --> 21:06.291
<c.speaker>Fly us out of here.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.291
<c.speaker>After you unfreeze
my sister.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.625
<c.speaker>[muffled shouts]

21:15.083 --> 21:18.458
<c.speaker>Shuriki is gone.
For good.

21:18.458 --> 21:19.875
<c.speaker>-Ay, <i>mija.  </i>
-You saved us all.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.458
<c.speaker>I was so worried.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.000
<c.speaker>You are sure this time?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.708
<c.speaker>I'm sure.

21:26.708 --> 21:28.208
<c.speaker>What do we do
with the Duke?

21:28.208 --> 21:30.458
<c.speaker>There's an empty cell
in the tower.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.583
<c.speaker>That'll do.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.583
<c.speaker>What? But I'm <i>familia! </i>

21:37.000 --> 21:40.083
<c.speaker>You have no idea
what that word means.

21:54.083 --> 21:57.708
<c.speaker>Let this be remembered
as the day sirenas and humans

21:57.708 --> 22:02.708
<c.speaker>defended Avalor together
and began a new era
of friendship!

22:05.750 --> 22:07.500
<c.speaker>You were right, <i>mija. </i>

22:07.500 --> 22:09.166
<c.speaker>This was our chance.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.000
<c.speaker>And I'm glad we took it.

22:15.625 --> 22:19.750
<c.speaker>Princess Elena, I look forward
to a new era of peace,

22:19.750 --> 22:21.500
<c.speaker>on land and sea.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.708
<c.speaker>[cheering]

22:25.708 --> 22:27.333
<c.speaker>Whoo-hoo!

22:27.333 --> 22:29.333
<c.speaker>[cheering]

22:34.083 --> 22:37.083
<c.speaker>I know. You told me so.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.083
<c.speaker>[chuckles]

22:45.375 --> 22:48.458
<c.speaker>I dreamt of this day
for so long.

22:48.458 --> 22:52.125
<c.speaker>Sometimes
dreams do come true.

23:03.583 --> 23:07.000
<c.speaker>[theme music playing]
