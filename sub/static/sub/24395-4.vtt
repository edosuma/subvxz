00:17.852 --> 00:19.219
Ahmed.

00:20.015 --> 00:21.664
I can't believe it.

00:22.484 --> 00:23.687
Ah.

00:24.742 --> 00:27.218
I know. So long.

00:27.718 --> 00:28.914
It's good to see you.

00:29.616 --> 00:31.772
Can't get used to how you look
without the uniform.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.328
Yeah. Me, neither.

00:35.015 --> 00:36.817
Eight years.

00:37.179 --> 00:39.476
But I'm officially discharged.

00:40.882 --> 00:43.093
I can't get used to how
you look without the beard.

00:43.234 --> 00:44.718
Like Jay-Z, right?

00:47.145 --> 00:49.299
- I thought you were into Kanye.
- No.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.890
- Jay-Z now.
- Oh, yeah.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.211
Yeah, I listen to him
on my way home from work.

00:53.538 --> 00:55.562
"On my way home from work."

00:56.163 --> 00:58.163
Did you ever think you'd say that?

00:59.538 --> 01:00.731
No.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.859
Never.

01:03.437 --> 01:04.836
You're doing well, man.

01:04.983 --> 01:06.375
I'm happy for you.

01:06.523 --> 01:07.718
Thanks, Mike.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.039
So,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.617
how you liking Paris?

01:12.953 --> 01:14.596
Yeah, it's nice.

01:15.456 --> 01:16.983
But it's hard.

01:17.885 --> 01:19.510
Yeah, the women, though.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.273
I know.

01:21.346 --> 01:22.854
Can't get used to that.

01:23.104 --> 01:25.752
- Everywhere I go, women.
- Yeah.

01:25.909 --> 01:27.143
Any luck with that?

01:27.211 --> 01:29.692
- Uh, no, not yet. Not yet.
- Mm.

01:37.725 --> 01:39.424
I remember these.

01:40.385 --> 01:42.143
Long way from Gitmo.

01:42.861 --> 01:45.596
Sometimes I wake up,
and I think I'm still there.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.573
I don't know how you
got through it, man.

01:51.252 --> 01:52.659
Because of you.

01:54.307 --> 01:55.606
Listen, my, uh,

01:55.674 --> 01:57.044
shift starts in ten minutes,

01:57.112 --> 02:00.229
but I'm gonna take tomorrow off
to show you around Paris.

02:00.667 --> 02:01.783
Okay.

02:01.995 --> 02:04.112
- Let me get a shot.
- Yes.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.815
So we'll meet tomorrow, huh?

02:09.940 --> 02:11.612
Sounds good, man.

02:36.940 --> 02:38.417
- Hey! Hey!
- No!

02:38.606 --> 02:39.807
Stop him!

Episode Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"A Free Man in Paris"</font>

03:18.745 --> 03:21.228
My name is Michael Parkes.

03:22.251 --> 03:24.056
I'm an American citizen.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.220
I'm being held hostage.

03:28.261 --> 03:29.431
Bring...

03:29.712 --> 03:32.861
Bring five million euros

03:33.306 --> 03:35.384
to Parc de Villette in Paris,

03:35.485 --> 03:37.400
in the 19th district

03:37.785 --> 03:39.314
tonight at midnight.

03:40.163 --> 03:41.509
If not,

03:42.083 --> 03:43.900
they will execute me.

03:46.002 --> 03:47.814
Please get me out of here.

03:48.005 --> 03:51.431
There will be no police
or military involvement,

03:51.556 --> 03:53.384
or he dies.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.774
That's Ahmed Bakal.

03:56.118 --> 03:57.251
How do you know?

03:57.319 --> 03:58.367
There.

03:58.435 --> 03:59.935
See that?

04:02.111 --> 04:03.626
Same bracelet.

04:04.531 --> 04:07.408
He's the terrorist
who kidnapped my son.

04:09.665 --> 04:11.133
Is this really your first time
in Paris?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.908
It is. City of romance.

04:12.976 --> 04:16.250
The city of bad memories,
if you ask me.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.567
Did a French girl
break your heart, Oliver?

04:18.930 --> 04:20.345
Not exactly.

04:20.579 --> 04:22.751
- Zara.
- Hey, Zara.

04:22.819 --> 04:23.949
How's Paris?

04:24.017 --> 04:25.634
Beautiful, but we miss you.

04:25.702 --> 04:27.035
Is Mrs. Parkes there?

04:27.103 --> 04:28.384
I'm with her right now.

04:28.452 --> 04:29.700
Putting you on speaker.

04:29.819 --> 04:31.347
Mrs. Parkes, Eric Beaumont.

04:31.415 --> 04:32.790
We spoke on the phone.

04:32.869 --> 04:35.408
Ahmed Bakal kidnapped my son.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.894
Mrs. Parkes showed me
a photo of Ahmed

04:37.962 --> 04:40.126
wearing the same bracelet
as the kidnapper.

04:40.194 --> 04:41.926
I sent you a screen grab.

04:44.063 --> 04:45.286
Okay.

04:45.354 --> 04:47.016
Any progress sourcing the video?

04:47.099 --> 04:49.648
No. It came
untraceable.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.130
All right.

04:51.423 --> 04:54.097
Mrs. Parkes, since the
kidnappers aren't communicating,

04:54.165 --> 04:55.615
we're working on
tracking down Ahmed.

04:55.682 --> 04:57.933
He's our only connection
to Michael here in Paris.

04:58.001 --> 05:00.480
The police have searched his
apartment and his place of work,

05:00.567 --> 05:01.801
but he is AWOL.

05:01.888 --> 05:04.353
Of course he's AWOL. He's a jihadist.

05:04.486 --> 05:06.566
You know he befriended
my son in Guantanamo

05:06.634 --> 05:08.849
when Michael was stationed
there as a guard.

05:08.929 --> 05:10.243
We're still very much investigating

05:10.310 --> 05:11.311
Ahmed's complicity.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.222
Eric, did you get the contact info

05:13.290 --> 05:15.262
for the Paris resettlement
office I sent?

05:15.349 --> 05:16.455
We're here now.

05:16.523 --> 05:18.450
We'll see if Ahmed's
reintegration officer

05:18.518 --> 05:20.150
can help us track him down.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.892
We'll be in touch.

05:22.130 --> 05:24.205
Okay. Standing by.

05:25.298 --> 05:28.035
Jihadists who kidnap people
for ransom usually do it

05:28.103 --> 05:30.379
in places they control...
tribal Pakistan,

05:30.447 --> 05:32.126
the Islamic State... so why Paris?

05:32.194 --> 05:33.355
Because Michael's here now.

05:33.423 --> 05:34.534
But he doesn't come from money.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.228
Still, kidnapping an ex-Gitmo guard

05:36.306 --> 05:37.627
definitely sends a political message.

05:37.694 --> 05:39.137
If you're gonna kidnap someone,

05:39.205 --> 05:41.009
why set up a meeting
on social media?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.931
You're assuming
Ahmed's behind it.

05:42.999 --> 05:45.160
Well, the bracelet
was pretty incriminating.

05:45.228 --> 05:46.713
We don't know for sure
if he's involved,

05:46.780 --> 05:49.790
but someone like Ahmed can be
easily compromised.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.697
Plus, he does have a
history of violence.

05:51.765 --> 05:54.137
Society will isolate him, making him

05:54.205 --> 05:55.720
vulnerable to recidivism.
Still,

05:55.788 --> 05:58.314
let's not let our biases get
in the way on this one.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.259
Isn't it weird that
a Gitmo guard

06:00.327 --> 06:01.555
and detainee became friends?

06:01.623 --> 06:02.939
It's rare, but it happens.

06:03.053 --> 06:05.455
Probably weirder that
we became friends.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.673
- Ooh.
- Monsieur Beaumont?

06:07.845 --> 06:10.189
Ah, Madame Rigaud.
<i>Enchanté.</i>

06:10.298 --> 06:12.097
Uh, this is Maxine Carlson,
my second.

06:12.165 --> 06:13.406
- Hi.
- And...

06:13.474 --> 06:14.608
- Oliver Yates, our profiler.
- Hi.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.814
- Yes, hello.
- Hey.

06:15.882 --> 06:17.830
Uh, I pulled Ahmed Bakal's file
for you.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.246
- Okay, perfect. Thank you.
- Okay.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.543
<i>That's everything we know</i>

06:20.611 --> 06:21.855
- about him.
- Mm-hmm.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.384
Ahmed was
a low-level fighter

06:23.470 --> 06:25.369
when he was caught
in a raid in Afghanistan,

06:25.437 --> 06:28.751
then held in Guantanamo as an
enemy combatant without charge.

06:28.845 --> 06:30.298
He was released in 2013?

06:30.366 --> 06:32.347
That's right.
He was cooperative,

06:32.415 --> 06:34.611
and when Obama was trying
to close Guantanamo,

06:34.681 --> 06:36.238
they decided
he posed a low threat,

06:36.306 --> 06:38.205
and there was no reason
to keep holding him.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.033
France agreed to resettle him.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.681
How have you helped him
reintegrate into society?

06:43.005 --> 06:46.283
We arranged an apartment
for him and a job at a market.

06:46.626 --> 06:48.208
How's he been adjusting?

06:48.415 --> 06:51.157
He was monitored heavily
when he first arrived,

06:51.348 --> 06:54.707
but he's been living here
five years without incident.

06:56.465 --> 06:59.227
Ahmed texted Michael
to meet him at Café Sousse

06:59.306 --> 07:01.536
because it's a ten minute walk
from his job.

07:01.692 --> 07:05.395
But the market where he works
is actually 20 minutes away.

07:05.907 --> 07:06.941
By metro.

07:07.147 --> 07:08.223
So, he got it wrong.

07:08.325 --> 07:10.590
Oh, Paris life ain't cheap.

07:11.274 --> 07:12.934
Maybe he has another job?

07:13.129 --> 07:14.826
At a body shop
under the table.

07:14.894 --> 07:16.022
There's only
one body shop

07:16.090 --> 07:17.717
within a ten minute walk
from the café.

07:17.866 --> 07:19.504
Let's hit the body shop.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.566
How is Evie doing?

07:33.809 --> 07:34.827
After Delaine?

07:34.895 --> 07:36.690
Yeah, her mom tells me
she's okay.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.924
Teenage girls.

07:38.011 --> 07:39.425
Masters of the cold shoulder.

07:39.512 --> 07:41.007
Yeah, the silence is deafening.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.242
As-salaam alaikum.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.663
<i>Alaikum salaam.</i>

07:44.050 --> 07:46.802
We're looking
for an Ahmed Bakal. Is he here?

07:48.028 --> 07:49.502
I do not know an Ahmed.

07:49.589 --> 07:51.903
Crossed arms, delayed response.
He's defensive.

07:52.029 --> 07:54.786
- You mind if I, uh...?
- Employees only.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.114
This one getting an oil change?

08:13.653 --> 08:14.739
Yes.

08:15.181 --> 08:17.051
Even though
it doesn't have an engine?

08:25.968 --> 08:27.054
Oh.

08:27.161 --> 08:28.341
But look.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.309
It does have an Ahmed.

08:31.536 --> 08:34.371
I always had a bad feeling
about Ahmed.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.496
After they became friends,
Michael changed.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.386
He started on antidepressants.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.011
You think Ahmed caused it?

08:42.410 --> 08:44.661
I think he poisoned his mind.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.161
I get it: Guantanamo

08:47.239 --> 08:49.876
is controversial,
but don't those people see

08:49.963 --> 08:52.731
their attacks justify Gitmo's existence?

08:53.168 --> 08:55.772
Actually, I think
Guantanamo is used

08:55.840 --> 08:58.270
by jihadists as a recruitment tool.

08:59.489 --> 09:01.207
Are you Muslim?

09:03.762 --> 09:05.512
I'm Zoroastrian.

09:07.582 --> 09:09.122
Not Muslim.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.942
Look, I already said to you,
I don't know any jihadists.

09:15.286 --> 09:16.762
Not anymore.

09:17.887 --> 09:19.411
Are you sure you're not cops?

09:19.613 --> 09:20.848
We're negotiators.

09:20.937 --> 09:22.104
- Hey.
- Ah.

09:22.371 --> 09:23.856
And you think I did this?

09:24.231 --> 09:27.137
No. Michael and I were
supposed to meet.

09:27.226 --> 09:28.307
He never showed.

09:28.488 --> 09:30.856
I knew something happened.
I got nervous.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.497
I don't know where he is.

09:33.379 --> 09:35.375
I swear to you,
I'd never hurt him.

09:35.661 --> 09:37.059
Then why were you hiding?

09:37.163 --> 09:39.445
The police were at my house.
They think I'm a terrorist.

09:39.532 --> 09:40.624
Well, the thing is, Ahmed,

09:40.692 --> 09:41.749
hiding only makes you

09:41.817 --> 09:43.739
- look guilty.
- I didn't know what else to do.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.161
I'm supposed to be a free man,

09:46.312 --> 09:47.993
but Paris still feels like a prison.

09:48.182 --> 09:50.247
Have you been
in contact with any jihadists

09:50.332 --> 09:51.465
since you've been in Paris?

09:51.564 --> 09:52.692
No.

09:53.999 --> 09:55.239
What's that?

09:56.152 --> 09:57.864
What?
This? 'Cause...

09:57.932 --> 10:01.046
the man in Michael's ransom
video has the exact same one.

10:02.150 --> 10:04.051
- Thousands of people have this.
- Hmm.

10:04.247 --> 10:05.460
It's a very popular team.

10:05.528 --> 10:07.319
If you aren't in contact
with any jihadists,

10:07.387 --> 10:08.828
then how did they know
where to find Michael?

10:08.895 --> 10:10.082
I don't know.

10:10.246 --> 10:12.231
There's got to be a connection.
Otherwise...

10:12.299 --> 10:14.301
It's a hell of a coincidence.

10:15.676 --> 10:17.250
We're meeting
with the kidnappers tonight,

10:17.317 --> 10:18.702
and I want you to come.

10:18.770 --> 10:20.473
You might be able to identify them.

10:20.613 --> 10:21.828
Look, I want to help Michael,

10:21.896 --> 10:24.364
but I don't want anything
to do with jihadists.

10:24.603 --> 10:26.379
You won't be with them.
You'll be with us.

10:26.497 --> 10:27.864
And we'll protect you.

10:28.793 --> 10:30.184
Michael needs your help.

10:50.479 --> 10:51.997
Where are your guns?

10:52.939 --> 10:54.413
We're negotiating in good faith.

10:54.481 --> 10:56.561
Guns have a tendency
to undermine that. All right.

10:56.629 --> 10:58.356
It's gonna be okay.
Let's go.

11:02.597 --> 11:03.709
I'm trying to be objective.

11:03.777 --> 11:05.944
I keep thinking
"ethnic disproportionality,

11:06.012 --> 11:07.668
cultural bias," but...

11:07.957 --> 11:09.207
But?

11:09.862 --> 11:12.715
I don't know. I just have
a bad feeling about this guy.

11:12.911 --> 11:14.968
That doesn't sound like
an official psychological

11:15.036 --> 11:16.142
analysis.

11:16.229 --> 11:18.192
No, it's an opinion.

11:19.558 --> 11:21.153
<i>Did you bring the money?</i>

11:30.773 --> 11:32.108
My name is Eric Beaumont.

11:32.195 --> 11:34.231
I'm a negotiator hired
by Michael's mother.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.426
She has scraped together
every penny she has.

11:38.324 --> 11:39.848
Is Michael with you?

11:41.583 --> 11:44.079
The range of an NFC speaker is 200 feet.

11:44.147 --> 11:45.782
He's here. Somewhere.

11:46.379 --> 11:48.221
Well, I'm prepared
to make you an offer

11:48.308 --> 11:50.723
if you can guarantee
the life of her son.

11:51.082 --> 11:52.979
How much?
I said how much?

11:53.066 --> 11:54.460
I give you 200,000,

11:54.528 --> 11:55.795
you give us Michael,

11:56.004 --> 11:57.161
and we walk away.

11:57.403 --> 11:58.723
We said five million.

11:58.791 --> 11:59.879
I don't have five million.

11:59.947 --> 12:02.153
I can get you more,

12:02.653 --> 12:04.770
but I need proof that Michael is alive.

12:06.707 --> 12:08.746
You recognize the voice.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.356
It's a good payday.

12:12.739 --> 12:13.799
Hey.

12:13.996 --> 12:16.184
Help us help Michael.

12:16.692 --> 12:17.996
Who is it?

12:18.825 --> 12:21.434
It's, uh, Samir.

12:22.668 --> 12:23.957
My cousin.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.412
The voice is Ahmed's cousin,

12:26.499 --> 12:27.723
Samir.

12:28.968 --> 12:30.450
All right, last chance.

12:30.975 --> 12:33.090
200,000 euros for Michael

12:33.442 --> 12:34.787
and no police.

12:35.176 --> 12:36.222
We'll kill him.

12:36.559 --> 12:38.942
If you kill him,
no money, Samir.

12:39.746 --> 12:41.145
He's dead.

12:52.090 --> 12:53.450
Here. Take a seat.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.661
You said Samir is your cousin.

13:03.729 --> 13:06.153
Your file says you have
no living relatives.

13:06.438 --> 13:09.536
After my parents died,
Samir's father raised me.

13:10.545 --> 13:11.835
Samir and I grew up together.

13:11.903 --> 13:14.145
He's not someone
who would hurt innocents.

13:14.709 --> 13:16.293
Might he have been...

13:16.466 --> 13:17.918
radicalized at some point?

13:18.015 --> 13:19.263
He's never been devout.

13:19.436 --> 13:21.496
Now people are radicalized
for different reasons.

13:21.714 --> 13:23.817
Sometimes, it's religion,
but it could be racism,

13:23.890 --> 13:25.871
unemployment,
anything that would make him

13:25.939 --> 13:27.598
feel alienated from society.

13:27.686 --> 13:30.080
We need to get behind
this jihadi mask he's wearing,

13:30.148 --> 13:32.598
figure out
what's really driving him.

13:32.981 --> 13:34.913
- Samir...
- Excuse me, madame.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.680
Thank you.

13:37.101 --> 13:38.457
Here.

13:39.298 --> 13:41.145
Samir's father.

13:41.311 --> 13:42.723
What's his name?

13:43.264 --> 13:44.621
Yasser Bakal.

13:44.689 --> 13:45.735
Yasser?

13:45.803 --> 13:47.165
Okay. And, um,

13:47.774 --> 13:49.075
where is he now?

13:51.796 --> 13:53.075
He's dead.

13:57.325 --> 13:58.989
What aren't you telling me,
Ahmed?

13:59.484 --> 14:01.059
Yasser Bakal.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.465
He was building bombs for
the insurgency in Afghanistan

14:04.606 --> 14:06.512
before he was captured
and sent to Guantanamo.

14:06.653 --> 14:08.395
You were in Gitmo with him?

14:08.701 --> 14:10.051
Cause of death:

14:10.282 --> 14:11.763
- heart attack.
- Maybe Samir

14:11.831 --> 14:13.063
blames America for the death

14:13.131 --> 14:14.762
of his father.
That definitely could be

14:14.830 --> 14:16.356
a radicalizing factor.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.529
You didn't tell us
'cause you're afraid

14:18.596 --> 14:20.403
that Samir has been radicalized.

14:20.494 --> 14:21.712
No.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.981
It's not possible.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.234
Did you see your uncle in prison?

14:26.493 --> 14:28.473
We were in different cell blocks.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.887
Sometimes I'd see him
through the fences in the yard,

14:31.955 --> 14:33.223
but that's it.

14:33.459 --> 14:35.332
Yasser died eight years ago.

14:35.858 --> 14:37.309
Why seek vengeance now?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.511
Opportunity.

14:38.846 --> 14:40.731
Michael was just discharged
from the military

14:40.799 --> 14:44.434
and came to visit our
buddy Ahmed.

14:45.348 --> 14:47.137
Even if
that's true,

14:47.831 --> 14:49.457
we've spooked Samir.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.512
He's not gonna get in touch.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.192
No, I think you're right.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.371
Call him.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.582
I think we've put Ahmed in
danger by outing him to Samir.

15:06.965 --> 15:10.223
It's a risk, but Samir knows
we can give his name to the police.

15:10.374 --> 15:13.161
It gives us leverage,
and it keeps Michael safe.

15:13.259 --> 15:14.411
For now.

15:15.127 --> 15:16.700
He's not picking up.

15:18.358 --> 15:19.825
You know where he lives?

15:21.090 --> 15:23.590
All right. Let's, uh,
let's pay him a visit.

15:24.683 --> 15:26.348
Why didn't you take his call?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.207
Because he told them my name.

15:28.349 --> 15:30.231
I know he is with them now.

15:30.487 --> 15:32.248
You're a good soldier, Samir.

15:32.344 --> 15:33.661
Ambitious.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.918
But you failed to get the money.

15:36.356 --> 15:38.817
Your father
would be ashamed.

15:41.789 --> 15:43.246
I will get it.

15:43.414 --> 15:44.606
I promise.

15:44.674 --> 15:45.995
Samir.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.512
I want you to see this
as an opportunity.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.840
What do you mean?

16:05.660 --> 16:07.840
Samir's place is on the fifth floor.

16:08.169 --> 16:09.848
Apartment 502.

16:10.159 --> 16:11.770
Should I drive around back?

16:13.239 --> 16:14.872
No, we're going in
through the front door.

16:14.939 --> 16:16.654
Make sure Samir knows
we're coming.

16:17.098 --> 16:18.996
You're our eyes and ears out here,
okay?

16:20.985 --> 16:22.489
Lead the way.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.543
Samir?

16:49.375 --> 16:51.387
No sign of Samir, but...

16:52.192 --> 16:53.887
we are being watched.

17:13.791 --> 17:15.162
Is this you?

17:15.837 --> 17:18.565
Yeah. And this is...

17:19.030 --> 17:20.036
Yasser.

17:20.262 --> 17:21.481
My uncle.

17:21.705 --> 17:23.464
Samir's father.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.917
Lot of behavioral residue in here.

17:27.986 --> 17:29.347
What does it tell you?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.332
Cheeseburger and fries.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.692
Now I want a burger.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.558
He likes fast food.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.669
And beer.

17:35.803 --> 17:37.254
Alcohol is forbidden
by the Koran,

17:37.322 --> 17:40.168
so probably
not a religious ideologue.

17:40.873 --> 17:43.551
Garbage is the window
to the soul.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.442
It's Samir.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.246
Here.

17:52.379 --> 17:53.754
Hello?

17:54.777 --> 17:56.481
Put Ahmed on.

17:58.923 --> 18:00.731
I can get you what you want,
Samir.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.673
Then where's my money?

18:03.795 --> 18:05.291
I know you're under
an enormous amount

18:05.358 --> 18:07.348
of pressure right now.
I can help you, Samir,

18:07.416 --> 18:08.786
but you need to talk to me.

18:08.866 --> 18:10.761
I want to see Ahmed
in the basement.

18:11.246 --> 18:13.364
The room behind the bicycles.
He knows where.

18:13.452 --> 18:15.012
I'm gonna be there, too.

18:15.174 --> 18:16.317
No.

18:16.652 --> 18:18.012
He comes alone.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.723
All right, let's go.

18:20.840 --> 18:21.989
He told me to come,

18:22.057 --> 18:23.520
alone. I heard what he said.

18:23.662 --> 18:24.825
Come on.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.301
Remember what we discussed.

18:40.394 --> 18:41.778
All right, is Michael with you?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.571
- No.
- Okay, I need to speak to Samir.

18:44.650 --> 18:45.744
Only Ahmed.

18:46.783 --> 18:47.918
All right. Listen,

18:47.986 --> 18:49.027
I'm with you.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.340
I'll be waiting.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.744
They didn't let you in, huh?

19:01.812 --> 19:03.040
I didn't think they would.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.892
But they didn't frisk him either.

19:10.060 --> 19:11.060
Get in.

19:11.169 --> 19:12.332
Look it.

19:12.434 --> 19:14.103
Same bracelet as Ahmed's.

19:14.244 --> 19:17.376
Yeah. I guess it <i> was</i>
Samir in the ransom video.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.025
You need to let Michael go.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.048
Ask him
if this is about Yasser.

19:24.158 --> 19:25.556
Is this about Yasser?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.501
You want the truth?

19:30.975 --> 19:32.158
Samir.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.736
Samir, I'm talking to you!

19:39.287 --> 19:40.822
<i>Sidi,</i>

19:41.124 --> 19:42.665
when did you get released?

19:46.677 --> 19:48.697
I know you are scared
and confused,

19:48.889 --> 19:51.033
and that's why you brought
those people here.

19:51.252 --> 19:52.736
But I want you to understand

19:52.804 --> 19:54.353
what we're doing.

19:56.715 --> 19:58.200
Mohamed Mansouri.

19:58.276 --> 20:00.459
Tunisian national.
A Guantanamo detainee

20:00.527 --> 20:01.798
until 2017,

20:01.866 --> 20:04.061
when he was transferred to
the UAE.

20:04.265 --> 20:06.587
He must've just got to Paris.

20:06.794 --> 20:10.264
Ahmed,
your uncle Yasser didn't die

20:10.332 --> 20:11.827
of a heart attack.

20:12.151 --> 20:13.806
Yasser was murdered.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.023
And your friend, Michael,

20:16.352 --> 20:18.337
was in the room when it happened.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.025
<i>Sidi,</i> with all my respect,

20:21.632 --> 20:23.439
Michael said
it was a heart attack.

20:23.586 --> 20:26.388
I was in a cell across the hall.

20:26.797 --> 20:28.526
I could hear Yasser screaming.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.161
They were beating him.

20:30.348 --> 20:31.916
He fought back,

20:32.011 --> 20:33.564
but they wouldn't stop.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.923
They beat him till he fell silent.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.798
Then I saw them take
his body away.

20:41.482 --> 20:42.955
And then I saw Michael

20:43.337 --> 20:44.790
leave his cell.

20:45.775 --> 20:47.369
Michael would never do that.

20:47.437 --> 20:48.571
He did.

20:48.785 --> 20:51.267
I knew Yasser since we were boys.

20:51.968 --> 20:53.863
He was my best friend.

20:54.145 --> 20:55.861
Like you and Samir.

20:56.892 --> 20:59.610
And your American killed him.

21:02.249 --> 21:03.516
You knew?

21:03.926 --> 21:06.172
<i>Sidi</i> told me when he came back.

21:10.009 --> 21:12.172
And you used me
to get to Michael.

21:12.401 --> 21:15.688
No, Michael used you.

21:16.165 --> 21:18.555
Why do you think
he became friends with you?

21:18.965 --> 21:21.243
Because you both like rap music?

21:21.847 --> 21:23.243
Grow up.

21:23.585 --> 21:25.704
He wanted to clear
his conscience.

21:26.206 --> 21:28.242
I'm sorry, Ahmed,
but your friendship

21:28.310 --> 21:29.680
with Michael is a lie.

21:29.865 --> 21:31.180
No.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.119
You are my family

21:33.782 --> 21:35.696
and I love you.

21:39.702 --> 21:41.049
I got these for us

21:41.117 --> 21:42.830
because we are like brothers.

21:43.479 --> 21:45.657
But for years, there
was nothing I could do

21:45.725 --> 21:47.573
to help you in Guantanamo.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.313
Or my father.

21:49.649 --> 21:51.610
Now there is something
we can do.

21:51.929 --> 21:53.697
Get the money.

21:54.254 --> 21:55.649
Think they're telling the truth?

21:55.744 --> 21:57.373
That Michael killed one detainee

21:57.441 --> 21:59.297
and befriended another?

21:59.393 --> 22:00.571
I don't buy it.

22:00.660 --> 22:01.743
We need to get Michael's side

22:01.810 --> 22:02.863
- of the story.
- Mm.

22:03.101 --> 22:05.954
Money's not gonna free him,
but the truth might.

22:07.149 --> 22:09.001
Ahmed,
get out of there.

22:11.395 --> 22:13.407
They took your freedom.

22:13.796 --> 22:15.133
They took your youth.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.002
They put you in a cage.

22:17.899 --> 22:19.376
Ahmed, you want to help Michael?

22:19.444 --> 22:20.805
I need you to leave, right now.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.508
Come back to Samir's apartment.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.516
It's time to pick a side
and act.

22:26.069 --> 22:29.335
Ahmed? Ahmed,

22:29.443 --> 22:30.928
can you hear me?

22:35.891 --> 22:37.387
Shoot.

22:47.997 --> 22:49.411
We lost him.

22:58.591 --> 23:00.115
They are on the move.

23:14.774 --> 23:16.407
They cut me off.

23:18.142 --> 23:19.503
They could be anywhere by now.

23:19.571 --> 23:21.454
All right, listen,
we still have leverage.

23:22.305 --> 23:24.972
Samir may be after justice
for his father,

23:25.040 --> 23:26.995
but Mohamed wants money,
money for the cause.

23:27.063 --> 23:28.673
Or start-up cash for his new life.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.251
He was in Gitmo for years.

23:30.319 --> 23:33.563
Either way, you know,
they'll get in touch.

23:33.911 --> 23:35.626
I knew Ahmed was vulnerable.

23:35.743 --> 23:38.610
We still don't know for sure
that he's been radicalized.

23:40.977 --> 23:42.834
You really think I'm biased.

23:44.556 --> 23:47.423
Well, you weren't here
in Paris for the attacks.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.478
November 2015? You were here?

23:51.696 --> 23:54.321
Yeah. We were, uh...

23:54.723 --> 23:56.306
in a café.

23:58.032 --> 24:01.011
I didn't know
where the shots came from.

24:01.079 --> 24:04.274
Just, uh...
I just froze.

24:06.569 --> 24:08.798
Look, I didn't want it to affect me.

24:12.696 --> 24:14.212
Hello, Samir.

24:14.384 --> 24:16.588
200,000 euros for proof of life.

24:17.152 --> 24:18.633
I will send a video.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.149
I want to meet with Michael
in person.

24:24.688 --> 24:26.915
Rue de Grattan and Rue de Chasseur.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.394
One hour.

24:28.469 --> 24:30.347
You said money won't free Michael,

24:30.415 --> 24:33.017
so what are we paying for?

24:33.126 --> 24:34.571
An opportunity.

24:35.196 --> 24:36.540
Come on.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.491
Where is the money?

25:01.559 --> 25:02.751
Here.

25:02.819 --> 25:03.899
Get in the back.

25:03.967 --> 25:05.392
Okay.

25:09.787 --> 25:11.728
Hey, Michael.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.406
My name is Eric Beaumont.

25:13.501 --> 25:14.631
I'm a negotiator.

25:14.699 --> 25:16.232
I was hired by your mother.

25:16.410 --> 25:20.330
Please, you... you got
to get me out of here.

25:20.628 --> 25:22.594
I'm working on it,
but I need you tell me

25:22.662 --> 25:26.673
everything you know about Yasser
Bakal's death at Guantanamo.

25:27.054 --> 25:28.706
Yasser?

25:30.579 --> 25:32.392
What-what does that
have to do with this?

25:32.571 --> 25:33.970
How did he die?

25:34.636 --> 25:36.651
He had a heart attack.

25:38.186 --> 25:40.329
Were you there when it happened?

25:41.184 --> 25:42.634
No.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.087
I had nothing to do with it.

25:46.737 --> 25:47.985
Let's go. Drive.

25:48.174 --> 25:50.254
Wait, w... where are we going?

26:23.112 --> 26:24.344
What's this?

26:24.566 --> 26:25.979
What's going on?

26:34.995 --> 26:36.206
Samir?

26:36.274 --> 26:38.757
If you touch Michael,
the car or the cameras,

26:38.878 --> 26:40.757
the bomb will explode.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.944
All right, let's talk about this.

26:45.899 --> 26:47.193
Bring the rest of the money.

26:47.261 --> 26:48.395
One hour.

26:48.706 --> 26:50.538
I just gave you 200,000.

26:50.606 --> 26:52.719
I asked for five million.

26:53.364 --> 26:55.507
No more negotiation.

26:57.312 --> 26:58.756
What's going on?

26:59.078 --> 27:01.038
There is a bomb in the trunk.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.636
Oh, my God.

27:04.704 --> 27:06.468
It's probably rigged
with a remote detonator.

27:06.563 --> 27:07.710
So, what,

27:07.778 --> 27:10.257
that lunatic can just set it off
whenever the hell he wants?

27:10.325 --> 27:11.973
Stay calm, okay?

27:12.325 --> 27:13.874
Trust me.

27:18.113 --> 27:19.685
Someone called the
police, they're on the way.

27:19.752 --> 27:21.187
We gave them Mohamed's
name and the location

27:21.254 --> 27:22.321
of Samir's apartment.

27:22.389 --> 27:23.436
We've got a problem.

27:23.504 --> 27:24.518
Just the one?

27:24.586 --> 27:25.753
We know.

27:25.868 --> 27:27.114
There's something else.

27:27.889 --> 27:29.265
It's going viral.

27:29.671 --> 27:31.499
All right, okay.

27:31.835 --> 27:34.616
I don't want you guys
inside the blast radius.

27:34.684 --> 27:36.975
- Stay back 200 feet, all right?
- Well, what about you?

27:37.102 --> 27:38.811
I need to get Samir talking.

27:38.904 --> 27:41.874
Hey, you're dealing with an
unstable attention-seeker here.

27:41.942 --> 27:43.189
Samir's not gonna talk.

27:43.257 --> 27:44.852
How are you gonna
get through to him?

27:45.137 --> 27:47.037
Through Ahmed.

27:47.140 --> 27:48.236
Okay.

27:48.304 --> 27:49.750
All right, thanks, guys.

27:52.775 --> 27:54.755
He must be so scared.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.093
When I see him, I just see
his little four-year-old face.

27:59.161 --> 28:00.695
Hmm.

28:00.844 --> 28:02.139
How far along are you?

28:02.207 --> 28:03.308
23 weeks.

28:03.376 --> 28:05.397
Oh. Kicking up a storm, I'll bet.

28:05.677 --> 28:07.608
Well, he was, but, um...

28:07.838 --> 28:10.647
he's gone quiet the last couple of days.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.185
Ultrasounds are okay?

28:12.288 --> 28:13.413
Yeah.

28:13.481 --> 28:15.780
Oh, I'm sure you have
nothing to worry about.

28:15.848 --> 28:16.991
Mm.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.499
Oh, my God.

28:30.790 --> 28:32.475
When the time comes,

28:32.644 --> 28:35.397
Mohamed wants you to be
the one to kill Michael.

28:35.692 --> 28:37.515
You said you'd let him go.

28:37.768 --> 28:39.335
Uh, you can do this.

28:39.694 --> 28:41.686
I know what you are capable of.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.788
That was a long time ago.

28:44.163 --> 28:45.684
That part of my life is over.

28:45.814 --> 28:47.593
Michael killed my father.

28:47.864 --> 28:50.013
This is about family.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.093
This is about justice.

28:56.351 --> 28:57.432
No, no, no, no.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.829
- Okay, okay.
- No, no, they said no cops.

28:59.945 --> 29:01.263
They said no cops.

29:10.192 --> 29:11.624
Okay.

29:12.114 --> 29:13.648
Who's in charge?

29:14.298 --> 29:15.612
Eric Beaumont.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.222
I'm a negotiator hired
by the hostage's family.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.053
Bo Shaladi, commanding officer,
GIGN, counterterror unit.

29:20.121 --> 29:21.924
- You need to move away from...
- All due respect, Commander,

29:21.991 --> 29:24.560
if you cut the feed, it will
push Samir to detonate the bomb.

29:24.628 --> 29:26.552
My men are searching for him,
and when they find him,

29:26.619 --> 29:28.592
I will give the order
to take him down.

29:30.785 --> 29:32.299
I need that feed live.

29:32.414 --> 29:34.857
Do what you have to do
to get it back online, okay?

29:37.123 --> 29:38.756
Samir?

29:38.894 --> 29:40.435
I know you're live-streaming this

29:40.544 --> 29:41.679
because you want the world
to hear the truth.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.763
Now, I want you... I want
to help you spread that message.

29:44.977 --> 29:46.156
All right?

29:46.224 --> 29:47.999
Michael Parkes.

29:48.363 --> 29:51.740
You were a guard at Guantanamo, right?

29:51.869 --> 29:54.169
- Yeah.
- How did you feel

29:54.497 --> 29:56.974
when you first arrived
at the prison in Cuba?

29:57.181 --> 29:58.267
Scared.

29:58.335 --> 29:59.463
Scared. Okay,

29:59.531 --> 30:00.616
why?

30:01.849 --> 30:04.296
I-I had never seen a terrorist before.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.382
And they told us...

30:06.648 --> 30:09.044
they told us that the detainees
would kill us if we even

30:09.112 --> 30:11.928
- turned our backs.
- But you became friends with one of them.

30:12.121 --> 30:13.588
Ahmed Bakal.

30:13.746 --> 30:15.701
- Yeah.
- Okay, how did, how did you...

30:15.784 --> 30:17.583
how did you get to know him?

30:17.855 --> 30:19.733
Escort duty.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.992
I'd take him to his cells, to sick bay,

30:22.060 --> 30:23.638
w-whenever
he was supposed to go.

30:24.128 --> 30:27.217
Ahmed wanted
to practice English, so...

30:27.285 --> 30:29.240
What did, what did you talk about?

30:30.289 --> 30:32.076
Music, mostly.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.042
I don't, I don't know, I liked him.

30:34.168 --> 30:36.602
And-and he liked you.

30:36.987 --> 30:38.498
I guess so.

30:39.094 --> 30:40.929
He used to give me his cups.

30:41.328 --> 30:43.480
"Cups"? What-what is that?

30:44.085 --> 30:47.162
The detainees would only drink
out of Styrofoam cups,

30:47.230 --> 30:50.803
and they-they used to draw
flowers all over them.

30:51.571 --> 30:56.615
We were supposed to throw them out,
but I kept one of Ahmed's.

30:57.378 --> 30:58.799
Why?

30:59.299 --> 31:02.279
Gitmo was... such an ugly place.

31:03.913 --> 31:06.295
He found a way
to make something beautiful.

31:09.602 --> 31:12.857
Yasser Bakal. Ahmed's uncle.

31:13.131 --> 31:17.037
Now, he died at Guantanamo,
right?

31:17.358 --> 31:19.107
Yeah, he had a heart attack.

31:19.255 --> 31:21.323
And you told me you had
nothing to do with it.

31:21.406 --> 31:22.769
Liar!

31:22.968 --> 31:24.817
He's lying.

31:25.170 --> 31:27.518
If Yasser died of a heart attack,

31:27.699 --> 31:30.295
why would you tell me you
had nothing to do with it?

31:30.577 --> 31:33.027
What really happened that day?

31:34.398 --> 31:35.959
What is he doing?

31:36.498 --> 31:38.261
Finding out the truth.

31:38.821 --> 31:40.987
Now, I know you were in the room

31:41.470 --> 31:43.159
when Yasser died.

31:44.036 --> 31:48.015
And I know you started taking
antidepressants shortly after.

31:49.321 --> 31:51.573
Now, look at me, Michael.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.878
Tell me what happened.

31:56.635 --> 31:58.635
It was just a normal day.

31:59.026 --> 32:00.933
I was on escort duty.

32:01.001 --> 32:03.495
I was supposed to
take Yasser to sick bay.

32:03.626 --> 32:04.870
Why?

32:04.938 --> 32:06.792
He had a heart condition.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.119
He wasn't feeling good.

32:09.598 --> 32:12.237
He had lost his court case
about a week before.

32:12.403 --> 32:13.714
Court case?

32:13.999 --> 32:16.925
Yasser, he challenged
his detention

32:17.063 --> 32:18.581
in civilian court.

32:19.128 --> 32:20.683
But he lost.

32:21.445 --> 32:23.714
He was, he was really upset
about it

32:24.123 --> 32:26.370
'cause he knew he was
never gonna get out.

32:26.567 --> 32:29.987
So, I went to his cell
to put his leg irons on and...

32:31.247 --> 32:32.839
and he freaked out.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.417
He was just screaming

32:35.683 --> 32:37.019
and-and shaking.

32:37.272 --> 32:39.198
His-his whole body was shaking
so bad,

32:39.266 --> 32:41.987
it was like he was
having a-a panic attack.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.995
I think he thought I was there
to execute him.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.487
Then what happened?

32:50.584 --> 32:53.128
Then I-I-I restrained him.

32:53.360 --> 32:56.394
Then I-I got him
on the ground and...

32:56.614 --> 32:58.714
I just wanted him to shut up.

32:59.757 --> 33:01.753
He stopped moving.

33:02.617 --> 33:04.878
And he-he stopped screaming.

33:05.295 --> 33:06.956
Then they took him away.

33:07.307 --> 33:08.620
It all happened so fast.

33:08.688 --> 33:10.058
I...

33:10.701 --> 33:12.519
His heart, it stopped beating.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.816
He was already dead.

33:15.406 --> 33:17.542
Michael was involved.

33:26.523 --> 33:28.042
I told you.

33:31.524 --> 33:34.769
If you let go, it explodes.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.336
I said do it.

33:49.435 --> 33:51.902
Samir, Ahmed.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.019
You need to hear Michael out.

33:59.628 --> 34:03.675
Now, you knew that
Yasser was Ahmed's uncle.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.510
Yeah.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.291
Why didn't you tell Ahmed

34:07.359 --> 34:08.784
the truth?

34:09.342 --> 34:10.969
I couldn't.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.543
I started taking
antidepressants, but...

34:15.190 --> 34:17.416
they didn't make me feel better;

34:17.503 --> 34:19.206
they just made me feel numb.

34:21.331 --> 34:22.902
But he saved me.

34:24.016 --> 34:25.753
Don't believe him.

34:27.511 --> 34:30.739
I think you befriended Ahmed
out of guilt.

34:32.541 --> 34:35.190
That's how it started at first,
yeah.

34:36.411 --> 34:40.784
But talking to Ahmed was
the only good part of my day.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.987
It was... I knew if
I told him the truth,

34:44.054 --> 34:45.222
he wouldn't forgive me.

34:45.402 --> 34:46.831
How could he?

34:48.107 --> 34:50.206
So I lied to his face...

34:52.565 --> 34:54.370
every single day.

34:55.572 --> 34:56.643
See?

34:57.016 --> 34:58.894
Do you hear what he is saying?

34:59.471 --> 35:02.089
What more proof
do you need?

35:10.482 --> 35:11.972
Ahmed!

35:21.867 --> 35:23.456
Hold your fire, hold your fire!

35:23.524 --> 35:26.042
If he drops the detonator,
the bomb will explode.

35:30.447 --> 35:31.946
We good?

35:33.636 --> 35:35.675
Maybe you were right about him.

35:37.261 --> 35:38.800
I can't watch this.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.129
I was worried
when you ran out on us.

35:42.232 --> 35:46.058
It's, uh...
it's good to see you again.

35:47.366 --> 35:49.066
Are we good?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.339
You lied to me.

35:54.167 --> 35:55.480
You killed him.

35:55.567 --> 35:57.473
I'm so sorry.

35:57.952 --> 35:59.284
Please.

35:59.352 --> 36:01.232
Ahmed, look at me.

36:02.615 --> 36:04.333
I know you're angry.

36:05.239 --> 36:06.706
Michael has blood on his hands,

36:06.806 --> 36:08.107
but you do, too.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.427
You were recruited by jihadists
when you were a kid.

36:10.495 --> 36:12.441
They made you do terrible things.

36:12.589 --> 36:13.877
I know you don't think you can ever

36:13.944 --> 36:16.144
forgive Michael, but you can...

36:18.483 --> 36:21.097
because you two
really aren't that different.

36:21.331 --> 36:22.644
He used me.

36:22.787 --> 36:25.323
Samir is using you.

36:28.331 --> 36:30.675
He wants you to kill Michael.

36:32.308 --> 36:34.495
That's not who you are anymore.

36:35.253 --> 36:38.096
You told me
you were a free man now.

36:39.712 --> 36:41.441
It doesn't matter.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.882
It's not what they see.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.683
No, you're right.
When they look at you,

36:45.751 --> 36:47.433
they see a terrorist.

36:47.879 --> 36:50.355
And people will judge you
for the rest of your life

36:51.020 --> 36:52.808
because they're afraid of you.

36:53.891 --> 36:56.277
This isn't who you are.

36:56.456 --> 36:58.461
Ahmed, you're a free man.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.381
Free to choose.

37:07.103 --> 37:09.597
If you don't kill him, I will.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.291
If you kill him, Samir,

37:13.589 --> 37:16.212
you're going to have to kill me, too!

37:19.528 --> 37:21.084
I was wrong about him.

37:21.217 --> 37:22.911
Samir, I know, for you,

37:22.979 --> 37:24.990
this is not about the money.

37:25.598 --> 37:28.467
But if this is really
about justice for your father,

37:28.535 --> 37:30.928
why is Ahmed holding the detonator?

37:31.177 --> 37:32.373
Why not you?

37:32.441 --> 37:34.593
Mohamed is not with you
anymore, is he, Samir?

37:34.661 --> 37:37.420
He is long gone with the money.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.545
He didn't care what happens to you.

37:39.612 --> 37:42.873
He didn't... he doesn't care
what happens to Ahmed.

37:43.199 --> 37:45.013
You keep Michael safe,

37:45.452 --> 37:48.467
the police here will have
no reason to shoot.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.826
All you have to do is surrender.

38:19.572 --> 38:22.318
No! Oh, my God.

38:22.672 --> 38:24.351
No, Samir!

38:24.789 --> 38:26.398
Hey, hey, hey!

38:29.528 --> 38:31.127
He's gone.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.226
He's safe.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.726
He's gonna be okay.

39:01.139 --> 39:02.750
He's gonna be okay.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.703
We lost him.

39:24.265 --> 39:25.793
Where are they taking him?

39:26.187 --> 39:27.808
In for questioning.

39:28.639 --> 39:30.449
But it's not his fault.

39:32.049 --> 39:33.945
Exactly.
He was forced into this.

39:34.013 --> 39:35.874
We'll make sure
the police understand.

39:36.662 --> 39:38.157
We'll do everything to help him.
