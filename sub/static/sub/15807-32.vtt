<i> ["The Ballad Of</i>
      <i> Gilligan's Island"]</i>

00:03.570 --> 00:06.238
¶ Just sit right back
    And you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.307 --> 00:08.307
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.376 --> 00:10.776
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.844 --> 00:12.811
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.880 --> 00:15.280
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.349 --> 00:17.649
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.085
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.153 --> 00:22.287
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.356 --> 00:25.690
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.759 --> 00:27.125
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.194 --> 00:29.461
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:31.797
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.865 --> 00:34.166
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.235 --> 00:36.434
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.503 --> 00:38.803
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.872 --> 00:41.273
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore of this ¶

00:41.341 --> 00:43.675
¶ Uncharted desert isle ¶

00:43.744 --> 00:46.077
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:46.146 --> 00:48.212
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:48.281 --> 00:50.148
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:50.217 --> 00:52.751
¶ And his wife ¶

00:52.820 --> 00:55.687
¶ The movie star ¶

00:55.756 --> 00:57.556
¶ And the rest ¶

00:57.625 --> 01:02.694

[gurgling]

01:34.028 --> 01:35.661
Hiya, Professor.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.963
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
You're awful nervous.

01:38.032 --> 01:40.531
I'm not nervous, Gilligan.
 I didn't realize you were here.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.634
- And you startled me.
     - Oh.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.536
- Hiya, Professor.
       - Gilligan!

01:44.604 --> 01:48.273
See, you're nervous! You jumped
 even when you knew I was here.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.974
I took Chemistry
            in high school once.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.443
I'll never forget it. I mixed
   ammonia with some acid.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.079
- You know what I got?
     - No. What?

01:54.148 --> 01:56.548
Expelled. They thought the
     school was gonna burn down.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.684
I wonder. You know, many kinds
of acids are highly combustible.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.886
Not only that.
          They can start a fire.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.788
Must be an important experiment
 you're working on.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.357
It is Gilligan.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.826
You've seen the dye markers the
Navy uses as distress signals.

02:07.894 --> 02:10.095
- The yellow stuff that floats.
- That's right.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.531
Well, I've managed to scrape
together some potassium chromate

02:12.599 --> 02:15.700
and I believe I've succeeded
in duplicating the Navy formula.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.802
- No foolin'. We can be rescued?
- Exactly.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.272
And I'm even adding
a phosphorescent compound

02:20.341 --> 02:24.009
to the dye to enable it
to glow in the dark.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.377
- Shiny junk.
         - That's it.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.746
When I add that
"shiny junk," as you call it

02:27.815 --> 02:30.515
to this yellow dye marker,
it'll glow like a torch.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.951
Planes flying nearby
will see it day or night.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.220
They'll follow it here
          and we'll be rescued.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.589
I'll go tell
            the others. Oh, boy!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.891
Oh, no. What's
         the name of that stuff?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.392
Well, it's a mixture of

02:41.461 --> 02:43.595
potassium chromate, ferric
chloride and calcium phosphate.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.399
- Potassium...potassium ferric..
- Shiny junk.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.700
Shiny junk. Yeah.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.702
Hey, we're
               gonna be rescued!

02:58.745 --> 03:01.612
- Skipper! Hey, Skipper!
  - What's all the excitement?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.481
- I have some news!
      - What is it?

03:03.550 --> 03:05.584
The professor is experimenting
  with chemicals

03:05.652 --> 03:08.720
he found right here
       and what happened to you?

03:08.789 --> 03:09.921
I had a small accident.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.591
I bent over to pick some bananas
and my pants split.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.493
So Mary Ann is sewing it up.
What's the good news?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.062
The professor is working
        on a dye marker

03:17.131 --> 03:18.931
that's just like the Navy.
      It lights up at night.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.965
- And you're getting too fat.
 - I'm not!

03:21.034 --> 03:22.667
You can really
see it at night?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.469
You can see that part
day or night.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.171
Cut that out, Gilligan.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.340
With a thing like this, we could
possibly be rescued. Oh, boy!

03:29.409 --> 03:30.808
What are you
     gonna do once rescued

03:30.877 --> 03:33.312
besides standing
  at the unemployment office.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.513
Honestly, I hadn't
     even thought about it.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.682
With the boat wrecked,
  I guess I'm out of business.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.617
Guess, I'll join
        back the Navy.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.553
Okay. You go in the Navy,
   I'll go too.

03:41.621 --> 03:44.189
I had no idea
    that you felt that way.

03:44.258 --> 03:47.125
Well, Skipper, you're my buddy
 and my pal and shipmate.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.626
You mean, you'd stick with me?

03:48.695 --> 03:50.328
It's better than
              starvin' to death.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.662
(Mary Ann)
'Skipper, I finished your pant.'

03:51.731 --> 03:54.499
Oh, here's Mary Ann.
Ha ha. Mary Ann.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.335
Ha ha ha.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.439
I left them out two inches, just
like you asked me to, Skipper.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.375
- Thank you, Mary Ann.
     - Hey, Mary Ann.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.143
Did you hear
         we're gonna be rescued?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.545
Rescued? Oh, are
you sure, Gilligan?

04:07.614 --> 04:10.982
Are you 100% completely,
absolutely, positively certain?

04:11.050 --> 04:12.751
I'm not even that certain
       my name is Gilligan.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.752
But the professor says
          we'll be rescued.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.154
Oh, that's wonderful!
I'll go tell the others.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.390
Yeah.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.927
- There we are. Good as new.
  - I dunno, Skipper.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.398
Maybe she should've left out
    four inches instead of two.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.867
She only let 'em out..
Well, alright, two inches.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.703
But what do you mean four
inches? They're perfect!

04:31.772 --> 04:34.005
Okay, Skipper. See you later.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.573
For goodness sakes.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.744
Four inches instead of two.
  You've got a lot of nerve!

04:41.215 --> 04:42.914
[rips]

04:45.953 --> 04:48.620
Red cab. Red cab.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.655
They're never around
when you want them.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.757
Lovey, you keep forgetting
     we're on a deserted island.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.992
There aren't any red cabs.
      There's only Gilligan.

04:55.061 --> 04:59.130
Oh, yes, of course, Gilligan.
White cab. White cab.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.132
Gilligan, would you mind
     helping us with these bags?

05:01.201 --> 05:04.102
- Certainly, Mr. Howell.
 - Be careful of the large one.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.405
There's something
  frightfully expensive in it.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.639
- Money.
    - I'll be very careful.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.809
Watch it, that's my luggage.
    Watch it, boy.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.411
- Here, here. There you go.
  - Oh, poor Gilligan.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.346
No. He's a hardy fellow.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.516
- Whoop! I...Mr. Howell?
    - Yes, what is it?

05:18.585 --> 05:20.718
- Can I ask you something?
   - Certainly.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.021
- You folks going on a trip?
  - A trip? Don't be silly.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.422
We're being rescued.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.557
Really, Gilligan, you told us
that the professor was

05:26.626 --> 05:29.126
working on a scheme
to get us off the island.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.696
Surely we haven't been ship
wrecked before we even start.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.331
The professor
    is still experimenting.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.166
- He has to find more chemicals.
- Chemicals?

05:35.235 --> 05:37.735
'Yeah. He mixes the shiny junk
 with some other stuff.'

05:37.804 --> 05:40.238
Once it's all squishy,
    he adds some more goop.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.874
Then he heats it and pours
   one mess into another

05:42.943 --> 05:45.610
and then he.. Am I being
    too technical for you?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.381
Professor?

05:50.450 --> 05:51.883
- Professor?
          - Huh?

05:51.952 --> 05:54.886
Don't let me interrupt.
I just wanted to use your scale.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.220
Help yourself, Skipper.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.756
I just think it's near genius

05:57.825 --> 06:00.258
the way you figured
        to make this dye marker.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.360
No, just lucky to
find the chemicals.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.861
Afraid you're getting
a little overweight?

06:03.930 --> 06:06.664
No. But you know, a fellow
      likes to keep in shape.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.935
'By the way, that scale
   only goes to 200 pounds.'

06:11.204 --> 06:12.704
Thanks.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.707
Skipper, I cleaned up the other
scale. A big one by the fire.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.775
Gilligan, we use that
           to weigh the fish.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.612
If you don't mind,
 I'll use the professor's scale.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.215
Now, it's in here somewhere.

06:24.284 --> 06:27.485
This Navy manual will tell me
   how much I should weigh.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.554
Maybe it's under tonnage.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.127
Eh...here we are.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.697
There.
                 Six foot three.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.299
Says I should weigh 199 pounds.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.169
- But that scale only goes up--
- I know, only 200 pounds.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.839
Therefore I have
         nothing to worry about.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.508
Gilligan.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.052
[sighs]

07:07.561 --> 07:09.060
Ah, ah!

07:10.296 --> 07:12.564
- Ah, ah!
           - Tail.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.736
Okay, Skipper, it's all set.
    Have a seat.

07:18.805 --> 07:20.805
Do you think that
will hold me, Gilligan?

07:20.874 --> 07:22.707
Come on. We've weighed
          bigger fish than you.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.409
O-op.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.211
Alright. Step aside.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.515
[creaking]

07:34.721 --> 07:37.055
- Wow!
      - What does it say?

07:37.124 --> 07:40.325
You're in between a largemouth
 bass and a hammerhead shark.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.527
Never mind that, Gilligan.
   How much do I weigh?

07:43.596 --> 07:45.530
'Two hundred
    and twenty one pounds.'

07:45.599 --> 07:46.730
Skipper, you'll never
     get in the Navy.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.766
You gotta lose 22 pounds!

07:48.835 --> 07:51.102
- Skipper's gotta go on a diet.
- Yeah!

07:51.171 --> 07:52.670
(Professor)
'Oh, there you are, Skipper.'

07:52.739 --> 07:54.338
Listen. When I finish
making the chemicals

07:54.407 --> 07:57.542
I'll need a special raft to
release the marker out at sea.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.845
- You design it. I'll build it.
- He needs exercise.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.915
- My little buddy said that.
 - I'll be finished in a week.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.984
Hear that? In a week,
           we'll be rescued.

08:06.052 --> 08:10.021
I'm thinking, Gilligan, I've
got to lose more than 22 pounds

08:10.089 --> 08:12.089
in less than a week
   if we wanna join the Navy.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.158
You'll have to go
               on a crash diet.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.928
Exactly. This is what
you must do to help me.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.796
Anytime, no matter
what I do or say

08:18.865 --> 08:21.566
don't let me have anything
to eat. You understand? Nothing!

08:21.634 --> 08:22.633
Depend on me, Skipper.

08:22.702 --> 08:23.868
[bell ringing]

08:23.937 --> 08:25.871
Time for dinner.
              Come on, let's go.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.477
(Gilligan)
 That's Ginger's. Pass it down.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.514
- Pardon me, Ginger.
      - Thanks.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.019
That's Mary Ann's.
Pass it down.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.889
Here's yours, Skipper.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.258
Oh, now, wait a minute.
    Didn't you forget something?

08:47.326 --> 08:50.094
There's only a measly
  piece of lettuce on the plate.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.632
Oh, yeah. Your spoon.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.101
Gilligan, this isn't
    enough food for a grown man.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.103
It's enough food
for an overgrown man.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.105
Alright. If you
              will all excuse me

09:01.174 --> 09:03.741
I'll go read, to take
           my mind off the food.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.242
- Hey, Skipper?
        - Yes.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.647
Don't go too far. It's
your turn to wash the dishes.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.317
Well...there's one dish
         I won't have to wash.

09:17.657 --> 09:21.159
- Goodnight. Sleep tight.
   - Sleep tight?

09:21.227 --> 09:24.028
It's alright for you to say that
'cause you're not starving.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.131
Just forget about it
and go to sleep.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.100
I've tried to go to sleep.
      I've tried counting sheep.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.902
But they all turn into
    lamb chops. Boy, I'm hungry.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.973
We gotta get your mind off food.
Let's talk about being rescued.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.207
Good idea.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.710
Luckily, we've got the
professor. He's a smart cookie.

09:38.778 --> 09:42.279
- Cookie?
 - I mean, he knows his onions.

09:42.348 --> 09:45.616
If you don't shut up, I'm gonna
 bend you like a pretzel!

09:45.685 --> 09:49.153
Now, see what you've done.
 You've got me doin' it to me!

09:49.222 --> 09:52.724
I'm sorry. Every time I try
 to help, I end up a dead duck.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.297
[Gilligan snoring]

10:10.276 --> 10:12.210
[snoring continues]

10:27.694 --> 10:29.094
Ah, ah, uh-huh, ah!

10:32.298 --> 10:34.065
Gilligan?

10:38.237 --> 10:39.738
Gilligan?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.076
Are you asleep?

11:44.804 --> 11:47.806
And now for a nice
       midnight snack.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.976
Ah, ah, uh-huh, ah!

11:56.750 --> 11:58.949
- We work good together, huh?
 - Yeah.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.319
Once rescued, we'll do
     the same thing in the Navy.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.687
Not exactly, Gilligan.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.255
See, we won't be working
on rafts in the Navy.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.325
They've got rafts
where you push a button

12:07.393 --> 12:10.061
and the whole thing
blows up like a big balloon.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.964
Speakin' of big balloons,
    it's time for your exercise.

12:13.032 --> 12:16.033
Gilligan, you sure have a way
of making a fellow feel good.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.636
You said that you wanted
        to run ten laps a day.

12:18.705 --> 12:22.340
Right. If I run those ten laps,
I'll lose some of mine.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.776
- Some of your what?
      - My lap!

12:26.045 --> 12:28.012
Ten laps if I lose..

12:28.081 --> 12:30.882
Oh, never mind, Gilligan.
Well, here I go.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.422
Phew!

12:38.491 --> 12:41.793
- Oh, hi, Skipper.
       - Hello, Ginger.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.327
Wow. Ten laps!

12:43.396 --> 12:46.297
Oh, you're just in time
         for your exercise.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.633
Exercise? I just ran
ten laps around the island.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.102
Oh, well,
              this is different.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.671
These are the exercises
the movie stars do in Hollywood.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.540
You know, to reduce the waist
   and hips and so forth.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.877
That's where I need it. Around
the waist, hips and my so forth.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.280
Okay. Come on.
                  Here we go.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.218
Now, hands on hips.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.519
Feet apart.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.988
- Chest out.
          - Uh!

13:11.056 --> 13:13.258
- Head way back.
        - Uh!

13:13.326 --> 13:14.892
Way back.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.961
This is very good
       for your figure, Skipper.

13:17.030 --> 13:20.865
Oh, believe me, Ginger.
Mine will never look like yours.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.433
Now, we're gonna do
             the trunk exercise.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.535
This is guaranteed
        to slim down your waist.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.871
Here we go. Now.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.242
Come on, Skipper, do it.
        It's very easy.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.512
- It's just like doing the hula.
- Ginger, I-I can't do that.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.315
Come on. You want to
    get back in the Navy, right?

13:37.384 --> 13:40.918
Yes, but I wasn't thinkin'
about joining the waves.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.187
That's right.
            Now you're swingin'.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.988
Go.

13:45.057 --> 13:45.990
(Ginger)
           'Come on.'

13:46.059 --> 13:48.058
Oh, isn't that lovely?

13:48.127 --> 13:50.194
You know, they say,
if you watch the movements

13:50.263 --> 13:51.896
you can tell the whole story.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.865
I don't get
                what he's saying

13:53.934 --> 13:56.400
but with her,
           I do get the message.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.236
(Mary Ann)
       'Lunch is ready.'

13:59.739 --> 14:02.673
Uh, sorry, Skipper. But
 you're not on the guest list.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.208
Oh, but, Mr. Howell,
            I'm starving!

14:04.277 --> 14:06.411
Oh, Skipper, I found
these reducing pills.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.679
You take one
every time you're hungry.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.516
- Good. Come, Lovey darling.
  - Thanks a lot.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.395
Skipper, hold still.
I can't read the scale.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.697
I hope you two
        are working on that raft

14:26.766 --> 14:28.833
because the phosphorescent dye
  is almost finished.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.568
We'll be ready
    when you are, Professor.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.671
Good. Once the plane spots that
 marker, we'll to be rescued.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.372
- Hot dog!
          - Gilligan?

14:35.441 --> 14:37.175
Sorry.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.044
- Well, how much do I weigh?
  - Let's see here.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.481
You got to lose two more pounds
to get into the Navy.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.451
- Let me see that book!
    - Here you go.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.491
Well, you satisfied?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.626
Yeah.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.667
- What's the matter?
      - The-the scale.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.836
- What's the matter with it?
  - Even if I can get in.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.838
You can't. You're
    five pounds underweight.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.041
Underweight?

15:22.355 --> 15:25.189
Now, open up, Gilligan.

15:25.258 --> 15:30.461
There. Just two more spoonful's
 and it'll all be gone.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.730
- Keep eating, Gilligan.
    - Mrs. Howell.

15:32.799 --> 15:36.066
You know, you have to eat
 if you want to join the Skipper

15:36.135 --> 15:37.801
and be in the Navy
             when we're rescued.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.404
But, Mrs. Howell..

15:39.472 --> 15:42.439
You have to gain
   five more pounds in two days.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.743
Or is it two pounds
             in five days..

15:45.812 --> 15:47.377
Well, any case,
                 keep eating.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.981
This is the third meal I've had
today. It's not even lunch yet.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.050
Oh, my, my.
        What a charming picture.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.120
Reminds me of when my nanny
 fed me. It was so embarrassing.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.422
Why was it
     embarrassing, darling?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.691
It was my senior year
           at Harvard.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.359
Well, how's
      operation gluttony coming?

16:02.428 --> 16:04.929
I see the boy's gained
      three quarters of a pound.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.464
Isn't that wonderful?

16:06.532 --> 16:09.033
I sure hope so,
'cause I can't eat another bite!

16:09.102 --> 16:10.634
Gilligan, if you want
your appetite back

16:10.703 --> 16:13.304
why don't you come
and help me built the raft.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.772
Oh, no, Skipper. He mustn't
  have any exercise at all.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.942
- That's out of the question.
 - But, Mrs. Howell--

16:18.010 --> 16:20.677
No, Gilligan. If you work,
   you're liable to perspire.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.113
And if you perspire,
 you're liable to lose weight.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.116
Isn't that true, Thurston?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.185
Well, I don't know.
           I've never perspired.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.190
- Ooh, that smells good!
    - Mmm.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.992
- Here. I'll take it to him.
  - Oh, no. No, you don't.

16:35.061 --> 16:37.628
- It's my turn.
      - Oh, I know. But..

16:37.697 --> 16:40.498
- Why don't we both feed him?
 - Okay. Good idea.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.601
We'll turn the little string
 bean into a jolly green giant.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.505
[tapping]

16:52.912 --> 16:55.846
Oh, Gilligan, I don't think
  I can hold out much longer.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.583
All I can think of
is sirloin steak.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.451
French fried potatoes,
mushroom sauce..

17:01.520 --> 17:04.121
Skipper, please,
            not when I'm eating.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.590
We brought you some soft-shell
 crab and some fresh pineapple.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.493
Crab and pineapple.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.400
Uh-huh, Skipper. I saw you
  put something in your mouth.

17:15.468 --> 17:19.037
Gilligan, for your information,
these are nails.

17:23.242 --> 17:27.109
- Spoonful of crab.
    - Spoonful of pineapple.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.380
Must you feed him
       in front of me?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.682
Oh, no, Skipper.
      We can go some place else.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.286
No, that's alright.
 At least I can smell the food.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.321
I mean, even though
     my stomach is unhappy

17:37.390 --> 17:39.223
my-my nose is happy.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.393
(Mary Ann)
     Spoonful of pineapple.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.094
- How're you doing, Gilligan?
 - Well, I..

17:44.163 --> 17:46.497
- Spoonful.
    - Spoonful of pineapple.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.901
Keep up the good work, girls.
How's the raft coming, Skipper?

17:49.969 --> 17:51.669
Oh, fine.
Just fine, Professor.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.437
Oh, good. I'm almost
          finished with the dye.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.174
Perhaps we can launch
           the marker tonight.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.642
- At night?
          - Why, sure.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.376
With a phosphorous compound
     that makes it glow

17:59.445 --> 18:01.278
it's even more effective
        in the dark.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.381
Okay, the raft will be
ready in an hour.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.217
That is unless
I take a bite out of it.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.854
Spoonful of pineapple.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.323
I could use a little help
mixing the chemicals.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.458
Could you spare me
one of these girls?

18:14.527 --> 18:17.428
- Well, I've been..
    - Spoonful of pineapple.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.330
- How about it, Ginger?
    - Well, okay, Professor.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.900
Mary Ann, keep shoveling.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.735
Okay.

18:24.804 --> 18:28.472
Spoonful of crab.
Spoonful of pineapple.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.607
Spoonful..

18:29.675 --> 18:32.376
Oh, I just remembered.
I have a surprise for you.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.279
Skipper, will you finish
feeding Gilligan for me, please?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.114
Finish feeding Gilligan?
    Well, no, Mary Ann.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.450
I'm on this diet and I can't..

18:39.519 --> 18:42.452
Why, certainly. I'd be glad
  to help you feed Gilligan.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.655
You just run right along.

18:46.258 --> 18:49.660
Now, Gilligan, open
your mouth real wide.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.429
Oh, no. You're not
           supposed to eat that.

18:52.498 --> 18:53.798
I'm the one that's
              supposed to eat.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.966
Oh, Gilligan, I've got to
have something to eat.

18:56.035 --> 18:59.136
- I've got to have something--
 - Remember the Navy.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.905
I'll remember
the Navy, but..

19:00.973 --> 19:02.540
- Just a bite.
         - Uh-huh.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.842
- Just a taste then.
      - Uh-huh.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.412
Could I lick the bowl?

19:09.748 --> 19:10.781
No.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.584
Darn me!

19:19.325 --> 19:20.791
How's the booyah base
           coming, darling?

19:20.860 --> 19:24.061
Darling, I've surpassed even
myself. Don't you agree?

19:24.129 --> 19:25.696
It's so yummy.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.733
- What say, hearty heart.
   - Mmm.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.400
An epicurean delight.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.269
A culinary masterpiece.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.605
Darling, I thought
you'd make a fuss over it.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.707
Oh, darling.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.509
Thurston dear, why have you
 never made booyah base at home?

19:39.578 --> 19:42.380
Back home, our house is so big,
I can't find the kitchen.

19:42.448 --> 19:45.383
Once I find the kitchen,
I can't find the stove.

19:46.652 --> 19:50.320
- Oh, Thurston, ah-ah.
     - Yes, alright, dear.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.122
Skipper, I can't
               eat another bite.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.291
Yeah, you have
my deepest sympathy.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.460
Once I get up to weight,
        I'm going on a diet.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.463
Are you outta your mind?
I haven't eaten in three days!

19:59.532 --> 20:01.532
Don't worry, Skipper.
       It still tastes the same.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.201
Oh, Gilligan, my boy,
     I prepared a dish

20:04.270 --> 20:06.303
to titillate even your
    unsophisticated palate.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.705
Behold the specialty <i> </i>
     <i> de la maison.</i>

20:08.774 --> 20:10.741
What is it?
     Smells like fish stew.

20:10.809 --> 20:14.745
Fish stew? World famous
  French recipe, booyah base.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.814
What does booyah base
     mean in English?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.883
Erm...fish stew.

20:21.821 --> 20:22.853
Eat it, my boy.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.489
- Ah-uh-ah!
    - Oh, no, no,<i> capitaine.</i>

20:25.558 --> 20:28.859
Eat, Gilligan, my boy.
  Oh, the nutritious goodness.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.228
You must wait.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.100
Here you are, Professor.
        I washed it real good.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.469
Good.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.571
You know, one thing
     I like about science.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.507
It's so...scientific.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.644
Oh, yes.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.513
You know, I took Chemistry
   when I was in high school.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.882
I'll never forget one day
   when I was in class

20:51.951 --> 20:54.117
I mixed ammonia with
      some kind of acid

20:54.186 --> 20:55.585
'and you know what I got?'

20:55.654 --> 20:57.721
- Expelled.
          - No.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.291
I got a date with the most
   handsome, young fireman.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.761
Well, I think it's finished.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.697
Just let it cool
and we'll be all set.

21:12.070 --> 21:15.406
Gilligan, here's the surprise
 I promised you.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.541
- Coconut cream pie.
      - No, Mary Ann.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.344
You take it to somebody else.
   I can't eat another bite.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.212
Oh, Gilligan,
I baked it for you.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.015
Now eat it!

21:25.084 --> 21:26.550
Hey, Gilligan.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.353
Raft's almost finished.
Come over and take a look at it.

21:30.723 --> 21:31.922
(Skipper)
        'Hey, Gilligan!'

21:38.631 --> 21:40.865
Well, you clumsy, bumbling--

21:40.933 --> 21:43.433
I'm sorry, Skipper.
 I tripped on the tool box and..

21:43.502 --> 21:45.502
Here. Let me take it off.

21:45.571 --> 21:47.104
It's alright,
little buddy.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.340
After all,
accidents will happen.

21:50.943 --> 21:54.177
There it is. Phosphorescent dye
that's gonna get us off here.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.979
Isn't it exciting, Professor?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.482
- Let's put it on the raft.
  - Please, allow me.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.784
I don't think I could duplicate
this formula again.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.587
I won't drop it. Who do you
     think I am, Gilligan?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.724
Oh, no. No! We haven't
been on the island that long.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.264
Thurston. Thurston.
Oh, Thurston.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.133
I just heard
the most marvelous news.

22:16.201 --> 22:19.169
We'll launch the raft tonight,
as soon as it gets dark

22:19.238 --> 22:21.038
and then we'll be
rescued. Rescued!

22:21.107 --> 22:22.640
Lovey, Lovey,
           curb your exuberance.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.675
Remember, after all,
            you are a Howell.

22:24.743 --> 22:27.477
Oh, darling, couldn't we forget
we're Howells just for once?

22:27.546 --> 22:29.146
You mean,
          give it a real rouser?

22:29.215 --> 22:32.316
- Oh, do you think we'd dare?
 - Oh, we can live dangerously.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.184
One, two, three.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.087
(both)
            Hurrah!

22:38.824 --> 22:40.925
- Ready, Skipper?
   - 'All ready, Professor.'

22:40.993 --> 22:42.726
'Just about to
    take it to the lagoon.'

22:42.794 --> 22:45.863
- Can I help, Skipper?
 - I'll help him. You just eat.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.634
Alright. Heave-ho, Professor.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.158
Well, you've done
      a fine job, Skipper.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.062
Now we'll put the phosphorescent
dye in the receptacles.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.097
- I'll get it.
   - Oh, allow me, Professor.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.399
Alright. It's back there
on the table by Gilligan.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.269
Oh, uh, Gilligan!

23:25.338 --> 23:26.937
There's a bowl on the table.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.673
It's got the professor's
 formula in it. Bring it here!

23:29.742 --> 23:32.742
(Ginger)
  Isn't it exciting, Skipper?

23:32.811 --> 23:33.944
Oh..

23:35.013 --> 23:36.346
Oh!

23:36.415 --> 23:37.815
(Gilligan)
          'This bowl?'

23:47.159 --> 23:48.592
It's empty.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.796
Oh, no!

23:57.202 --> 23:58.902
Oh, no!

23:58.971 --> 24:00.036
Oh, no!

24:00.105 --> 24:01.404
Oh, no!

24:01.473 --> 24:03.541
Skipper!

24:09.782 --> 24:12.282
Gilligan, I've heard of
    some stupid things

24:12.351 --> 24:13.750
having been done
        in my lifetime

24:13.819 --> 24:16.387
but this takes the cake!

24:16.456 --> 24:18.421
If you hadn't eaten
    the professor's formula

24:18.490 --> 24:20.123
we'd have been rescued by now.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.960
- 'I'm sorry, Skipper--'
    - Oh, never mind.

24:23.028 --> 24:26.463
Maybe a plane
    or a ship will spot us.

24:26.532 --> 24:29.266
'I hope so. I'm-I'm
    doin' everything I can.'

24:29.334 --> 24:30.701
Never mind, Gilligan.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.571
Now, just shut up
       and keep turning!

24:33.639 --> 24:35.206
[growling]

24:41.747 --> 24:44.181
[continues growling]

24:52.158 --> 24:54.658
¶ Now this is the tale
     of our castaways ¶

24:54.727 --> 24:56.660
¶ They're here for
       a long long time ¶

24:56.729 --> 24:59.295
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:59.364 --> 25:01.131
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:01.200 --> 25:03.333
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:03.402 --> 25:05.503
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:05.571 --> 25:07.471
¶ To make the
      others comfortable ¶

25:07.540 --> 25:09.739
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

25:09.808 --> 25:11.875
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor car ¶

25:11.944 --> 25:14.310
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:14.379 --> 25:16.280
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:16.349 --> 25:18.215
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:18.283 --> 25:20.684
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:20.753 --> 25:22.720
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:22.788 --> 25:25.389
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:25.457 --> 25:27.291
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶¶
