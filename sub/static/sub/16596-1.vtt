♪♪

00:10.778 --> 00:14.446
Okay, Aunt Dena
and Cousin Ruby
will be here any second.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.848
(sighs)
We have...

00:15.850 --> 00:19.018
welcome home balloons
and chips and guacamole.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.387
Oh, actually,
here in California,

00:21.389 --> 00:23.722
we pronounce it
"hwak-a-moly."

00:26.027 --> 00:27.993
Okay, so--
so no, they don't

00:27.995 --> 00:30.462
because nobody pronounces it
like that anywhere.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.700
All righty.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.303
Well, the bathroom floor is
so clean that you can lick it.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.905
We know that
because he did.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.375
Karen:
Well, great.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.377
Now you can clean the kitchen,
the back deck,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.545
and the veranda.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.881
-Stop.
-Joey: Mom...

00:48.883 --> 00:51.250
why do we have to
do all the cleaning?

00:51.252 --> 00:53.318
Ooh, let me answer.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.854
It is because...

00:55.856 --> 00:59.191
you built tunnels
under our home in Wisconsin

00:59.193 --> 01:02.561
and you made them collapse,
destroying our home, so.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.396
-Bingo!
-Bingo!

01:04.398 --> 01:07.066
Guys, we need to keep
Aunt Dena's place tidy

01:07.068 --> 01:09.501
while we're staying here,
especially now that Ruby's home.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.071
It is so not fair
that Ruby got to spend

01:12.073 --> 01:14.173
a whole summer
on safari.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.908
Why didn't
Grandma Janice take us?

01:15.910 --> 01:18.210
Oh, let me!

01:18.212 --> 01:20.879
She was going to take you,

01:20.881 --> 01:23.749
but then you... Oh!
You destroyed our home. Yeah.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.250
-Bingo!
-Bingo!

01:26.454 --> 01:27.786
(sighs)

01:27.788 --> 01:31.390
You know what the best part
about walking on the beach is?

01:31.392 --> 01:34.426
You always get to take
a little bit of it home
with you.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.430
Uh... uh, Mom!

01:38.432 --> 01:41.433
Maddie messed up the floor
that we just cleaned!

01:41.435 --> 01:42.935
Uh, Mom!

01:42.937 --> 01:45.437
Joey ruined the house
that we grew up in!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.308
You know,
I'll tell you what.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.144
I am really starting to regret
destroying that house.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.648
-Rooney cousins!
-Both: Ruby!

01:56.650 --> 01:57.916
-Ruby!
-Aah!

01:57.918 --> 02:00.385
-Ruby!
-Hi!

02:01.422 --> 02:04.423
Ruby! What?
You're so big!

02:04.425 --> 02:07.226
Look at the house!
It looks great, boys!

02:07.228 --> 02:09.461
Oh, thank you
for not making it collapse.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.899
Okay, Ruby,
how was your safari?

02:13.901 --> 02:17.202
Great. Grandma scared away
a lion by pretending to
be a bear.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.405
Both:
Aww...

02:20.407 --> 02:22.341
that sounds like Mom.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.079
Okay, Ruby,
we are so excited

02:27.081 --> 02:28.347
that we get to live with you!

02:28.349 --> 02:30.749
Me too!
I've never had siblings.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.585
Now it's like we're...
sorta siblings.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.621
-Aww.
-Aww!

02:35.623 --> 02:38.690
Liv, we have
a sorta little sister!

02:38.692 --> 02:40.592
-Aah!
-(giggles)

02:40.594 --> 02:44.429
You also have
two sorta big brothers.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.465
Don't ruin this.

He's on his way back
to Beloit to coach a game,

03:47.428 --> 03:50.028
but he said that
the home rebuild
is on schedule.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.363
Ooh!

03:51.365 --> 03:54.299
Let's take a gratitude moment.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.141
What is happening?

04:05.079 --> 04:06.778
She's letting us stay
here for free.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.147
Just pretend that
her weird stuff is interesting.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.285
Gratitude achieved.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.424
That is so interesting.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.594
So you boys excited
for the first day

04:22.596 --> 04:24.062
at your new school tomorrow?

04:24.064 --> 04:25.230
"School"?

04:25.232 --> 04:26.732
This isn't just a school.

04:26.734 --> 04:30.569
It's the Boyle and Oppenheimer
Official Magnet School.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.738
I'm goin' to BOOMS, y'all!

04:32.740 --> 04:35.874
BOOMS is a science
and technology magnet.

04:35.876 --> 04:40.045
I get to study cool stuff
surrounded by uncool kids.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.581
I'll be the coolest guy there!

04:42.583 --> 04:44.950
I am going to crush it there!

04:44.952 --> 04:46.618
Oh honey,
you are gonna crush it,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.020
Now blow it up.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.623
Parker Rooney,
you get back here and--

04:51.625 --> 04:54.559
and blow up your mother's
friendship fist right now.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.631
I'm glad someone's excited
about school tomorrow.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.839
Joey, I'm concerned
about your aura.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.076
It's noticeably less vibrant.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.145
Say what now?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.680
She thinks you look sad.

05:14.682 --> 05:18.884
Ma, dial back the California
around the cheeseheads.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.921
Now, why aren't you
excited about BOOMS?

05:22.923 --> 05:25.490
Okay, well, this may
surprise you guys,

05:25.492 --> 05:28.660
but I wasn't really
the coolest guy

05:28.662 --> 05:29.661
back at Ridgewood.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.696
No.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.297
Yeah.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.699
I was a dweeb.

05:33.701 --> 05:37.336
But at least this year,
I had become a senior dweeb.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.105
But now I have to go
to this new school

05:40.107 --> 05:42.507
where nobody knows me.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.511
Do you have to
or do you get to?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.648
Nobody knows you.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.351
You don't have to be
the guy you've always been.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.619
You could be the guy
you've always wanted to be.

05:57.291 --> 06:01.393
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.031
Think inner transformation.

06:07.134 --> 06:10.469
Sit down,
close your eyes.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.671
Let's find your spirit animal.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.240
-Ooh.
-What are you, Joey?

06:15.242 --> 06:18.710
A mighty lion...
(roars)

06:20.047 --> 06:21.747
a majestic whale...

06:21.749 --> 06:23.715
-(wails)
-Oh!

06:23.717 --> 06:26.151
-(wails)
-Oh!

06:26.153 --> 06:27.719
Mom...

06:27.721 --> 06:29.388
look at his shirt.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.424
He's clearly a kitty.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.892
(mews)

06:33.894 --> 06:36.228
There's no way that
I could be a kitty.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.829
They're way too perfect.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.998
No, my...

06:40.000 --> 06:41.500
(tutting)

06:41.502 --> 06:44.069
My-- my spirit animal is...
(tutting)

06:45.005 --> 06:46.605
a muskrat.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.206
Yes!

06:48.208 --> 06:49.608
Revel in your--

06:49.610 --> 06:52.411
your fun-loving,
muskrat free spirit!

06:52.413 --> 06:53.445
(chuckles)

06:53.447 --> 06:55.847
(tutting)
I'm-- I'm in a field...

06:55.849 --> 06:57.849
I'm-- I'm muskratin'
in the sun!

06:57.851 --> 06:59.117
Like a boss!

06:59.119 --> 07:02.387
Now carry that positive energy

07:02.389 --> 07:03.789
-with you to BOOMS!
-(chuckles)

07:03.791 --> 07:05.257
What? No!

07:05.259 --> 07:07.726
You can't send him
into school as a muskrat.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.628
Joey...

07:09.630 --> 07:12.631
do you see that shadow
swooping across the fields?

07:12.633 --> 07:14.533
Look out!

07:14.535 --> 07:17.602
-It's a falcon!
-(screams)

07:17.604 --> 07:19.137
-(Joey wails)
-And he snatched you up

07:19.139 --> 07:22.874
and he's ripping you apart
and he's feeding you piece

07:22.876 --> 07:25.744
by piece to his young.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.447
(sobs)
The horror!

07:28.449 --> 07:30.949
The horror!

07:30.951 --> 07:32.584
No.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.685
It's beautiful.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.456
The muskrat has become
one with the falcon now.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.291
Open your eyes

07:39.293 --> 07:40.725
and become...

07:42.496 --> 07:44.496
-a falcon.
-(gasps)

07:45.766 --> 07:47.232
Whoa.

07:48.769 --> 07:52.604
I am totally feelin'
that falcon vibe.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.973
Huh. Thanks, guys.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.176
Now I gotta go pick
the muskrat out of my beak.

07:58.178 --> 08:02.647
(vocalizing)

08:04.184 --> 08:06.651
-He is so not a falcon.
-Not even a little bit.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.958
Ohh! Ruby!

08:12.960 --> 08:16.328
I am so excited
to be rooming with you again.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.630
It's gonna be
just like it was

08:18.632 --> 08:22.133
back when I was filming
♪<i> Sing it Loud</i> ♪

08:22.135 --> 08:25.704
♪ You still do that ♪

08:27.708 --> 08:31.176

08:31.178 --> 08:33.345
-Aww!
-Aww, I know!

08:34.314 --> 08:36.181
Maddie and I actually
made that together

08:36.183 --> 08:38.183
when we were
about your age,

08:38.185 --> 08:41.286
and I would say that it is
our most prized possession.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.789
That is not.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.794
Whoa.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.062
Am I being punished?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.567
Meet Velvet Diggie.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.236
It is a portrait
of Maddie's real-life boyfriend

08:58.238 --> 09:00.372
that he had made for her.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.873
She thinks it's romantic.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.174
Romantic?

09:03.176 --> 09:05.844
Um, does she need new glasses?

09:05.846 --> 09:08.813
Okay, it's hideous, right?

09:08.815 --> 09:11.416
Right. Okay, so I need you
to help me destroy it.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.852
Um...

09:13.854 --> 09:15.487
I already told Maddie
that I hate it,

09:15.489 --> 09:17.606
so she's totally
gonna know it's me

09:17.607 --> 09:19.724
if I do it, but you know, if her
innocent sorta sister does it,

09:19.726 --> 09:22.060
you know, it's-- it's--
it's, uh, it's forgivable.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.529
So...

09:24.531 --> 09:26.164
Destroying it doesn't sound like

09:26.166 --> 09:27.832
something a sorta sister
would do.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.535
Mmkay, well,
sorta sisters have to
sorta help each other, okay?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.304
So, this can be
our sorta little secret.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.941
"Sorta" sounds
like sorta lying.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.177
Okay.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.414
But, uh, just know...

09:43.684 --> 09:45.050
that the sinister,

09:45.052 --> 09:48.520
judging eyes
of a ghoulish painting

09:48.522 --> 09:50.455
will now be watching you...

09:51.692 --> 09:53.024
always.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.462
I'm in.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.875
Time to take in
the school I'm gonna conquer.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.945
Conquerer pause
for dramatic effect.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.816
And commence conquering.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.052
Whoa.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.487
Sweet laser.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.656
-What's it for?
-You must be new.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.991
It's for the Laser Fair.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.560
Not to be confused
with the Laser Circus,

10:28.562 --> 10:30.795
which is next week,
and the Laser Pride Festival,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.497
which is at the end
of February.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.901
Oh, man.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.802
I'm gonna be the king
if this nerd-house in no time.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.838
This is BOOMS.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.642
This is me crushing it.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.909
Yeah, you did.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.078
-Fist bump.
-Mom!

10:48.649 --> 10:50.615
Looks like it's about what,

10:50.617 --> 10:52.117
1200 nanometers?

10:52.119 --> 10:56.021
(scoffs)
It's 1400 nanometers, new kid.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.256
What would I do with 1200,

10:58.258 --> 10:59.991
toast bagels?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.627
Bagels. Good one, Val.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.095
Up top.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.966
Stop being weird, Finch.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.701
High fives are for jocks,

11:09.703 --> 11:11.536
cartoon dogs,
and people who want the flu.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.640
I won the Laser Fair last year

11:15.642 --> 11:16.875
and I'm gonna win this year.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.444
Challenge accepted!

11:23.984 --> 11:26.351
That-- that-- that--
that was something

11:26.353 --> 11:28.286
that I-- that I used to say
at my old school.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.890
You know what?
Never mind.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.858
(school bell rings)

11:35.462 --> 11:39.397
All right, little geniuses,
please enter the Think Space.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.534
Anybody who notices
something new about me

11:42.536 --> 11:45.070
gets an extra 10 points.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.037
Anybody?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.473
No?

11:48.475 --> 11:49.874
It's a new haircut!

11:49.876 --> 11:52.544
You guys! Thanks for
looking right through me.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.079
Ah.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.980
You must be one
of my new students.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.916
What do you think
of my haircut?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.652
Uh...

12:00.654 --> 12:03.121
it's shorter probably?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.390
It is.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.358
10 points for...

12:07.360 --> 12:09.094
Pucker Rooney.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.996
(laughter)

12:11.998 --> 12:14.065
It's not Pucker,
it's Parker.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.668
Not anymore, Pucker.

12:16.670 --> 12:19.070
(laughter)

12:19.072 --> 12:22.207
Okay, so I wasn't gonna
be the coolest kid.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.009
But at least I was gonna
be cooler than Joey.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.580
It's a small victory,
but a victory nonetheless.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.181
(whirring sound)

12:31.952 --> 12:33.685
Do I hear a helicopter?

12:52.539 --> 12:53.872
(low-pitched)
Sup?

12:54.975 --> 12:58.143
The new Joey needed to
make an impressive entrance.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.078
No, that wasn't
really a helicopter.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.480
It was Aunt Dina
on the roof with a loudspeaker

13:02.482 --> 13:05.216
making helicopter noises
and a rope ladder

13:05.218 --> 13:08.453
that I borrowed
from some kid's tree house.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.458
Uh, who are you?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.594
They call me...

13:16.596 --> 13:17.962
Falcon.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.302
Sorry I'm late.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.404
I was searching remote areas
of the coastline

13:26.406 --> 13:30.508
for parts for a motorcycle...
that I'm building. By hand.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.346
Can you believe this guy?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.182
I cannot.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.818
He's the coolest guy
we've ever had at BOOMS.

13:41.087 --> 13:44.355
He moves with such certainty.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.090
Come on. Come on, you guys.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.992
You think he's cool?

13:47.994 --> 13:51.362
Jealousy is not a good color
on you, Pucker.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.533
This can't be happening.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.469
This can be happening!

13:58.471 --> 14:01.306
All right, students,
please take your seats.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.074
Uh, Falcon,
you can have my seat.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.648
You can't really think

14:10.650 --> 14:13.384
this Falcon thing
is gonna work forever.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.520
It's working today.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.756
And today...
is all I've got.

14:20.126 --> 14:23.127
So says...

14:23.129 --> 14:24.729
Falcon.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.467
Okay, so on day one,
all eyes were on Falcon,

14:29.469 --> 14:34.038
but tomorrow is the Laser Fair,
and Pucker will rise.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.707
Parker! I-- I meant Parker!

14:39.980 --> 14:42.013
-Hey, Maddie.
-Hey.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.250
You, um... studying
your playbook?

14:45.252 --> 14:48.386
I'm just gonna paint
at my easel.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.520
I do that.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.055
It's believable.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.361
Ruby and I had a plan
to destroy Velvet Diggie.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.564
She was going to
accidentally drop her art box

14:59.566 --> 15:01.432
onto a strategically placed
tube of paint

15:01.434 --> 15:04.335
which would then squirt all over
Velvet Diggie's ghoulish face.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.105
Ding dong destroyed!

15:08.508 --> 15:11.943
Hey, I hope you don't mind
that painting of my boyfriend.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.746
No, I love it.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.082
'Cause, like,
I know that it's...

15:18.084 --> 15:19.717
kind of goofy, but...

15:19.719 --> 15:21.185
no matter
how far apart we are,

15:21.187 --> 15:24.422
I look up at it
and I think, like...

15:24.424 --> 15:26.257
you know,
we're gonna be okay.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.526
Aww.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.598
Turns out the creepy painting
was romantic.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.100
And if it makes
my sorta sister happy,

15:36.102 --> 15:37.769
I can't destroy it.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.071
Wow.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.273
The painting means
a lot to you.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.309
I should probably
paint somewhere else

15:44.311 --> 15:45.643
so I don't get
anything on it.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.981
No!

15:49.983 --> 15:51.382
Oh, Ruby!

15:51.384 --> 15:52.550
What happened?

15:54.220 --> 15:56.220
Joey and Parker
destroyed your house!

16:03.396 --> 16:05.897
I ruined your most
prized possession!

16:05.899 --> 16:07.332
Liv's gonna freak out!

16:07.334 --> 16:08.967
No, no, no.
It's okay, Ruby.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.969
I mean, look,
a little athletic tape,

16:10.971 --> 16:13.304
and it's, uh,
I think it's good as new.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.572
See?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.274
I mean, I don't even--

16:16.276 --> 16:19.243
I don't even think
that we have to tell Liv.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.912
So, we're gonna lie to her?

16:20.914 --> 16:24.449
Oh, I mean...

16:24.451 --> 16:26.150
not really a lie.

16:26.152 --> 16:31.155
Just a sorta secret
between two sorta sisters.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.859
Ah.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.261
Another secret?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.464
I guess sisters lie
to each other.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.866
A lot.

16:41.868 --> 16:45.503
I think I'm, like,
nailing this big sister thing.

16:49.542 --> 16:54.178
And now the final contestant
of our Laser Fair, Val.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.380
You got this, Val!

16:55.382 --> 16:56.914
Whoo...

16:59.019 --> 17:00.485
(sighs)

17:00.487 --> 17:04.856
Behold, the power
of my laser.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.191
(beeping, whirring)

17:12.866 --> 17:14.766
(students cheer)

17:17.537 --> 17:19.537
It could knock down a building,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.973
but Mr. Beelick said no.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.510
Seriously, do not
knock down a building.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.946
The principal is still on me
for destroying the gym
last semester.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.416
We had a gym?

17:33.186 --> 17:37.355
BOOMers, I give you two-time
Laser Fair champion, Val--

17:37.357 --> 17:39.390
Not so fast.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.327
The Laser Fair has
one more entry.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.663
(students gasp)

17:51.404 --> 17:52.570
(students gasp)

17:52.572 --> 17:54.372
That's right, son.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.374
I made a laser
that can cut a laser

17:56.376 --> 17:58.242
that can knock down
a building! Up top!

17:58.244 --> 17:59.410
(gasps)

17:59.412 --> 18:02.313
No! Now I'll get the flu.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.384
Pucker's is the last
laser left standing.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.921
I-- I have no choice
but to declare him the winner.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.758
Yes! And now
a funky fresh
victory dance.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.293
In your face,
in your face,

18:15.295 --> 18:17.462
Pucker Rooney
owns this place!

18:19.299 --> 18:21.799
You actually just seem
like a braggy jerk.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.402
We support
each other here, Pucker.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.337
-Boo!
-Students: Boo!

18:27.574 --> 18:30.374
It turns out kids at a science
and technology magnet school

18:30.376 --> 18:32.710
in laidback California
are not impressed

18:32.712 --> 18:35.046
with witty taunts
and gloating.

18:35.048 --> 18:38.282
Boo him!
Boo him till it stings!

18:38.284 --> 18:40.451
Students:
Boo!

18:41.588 --> 18:42.653
Hey.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.455
Falcon?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.991
Shh! Shh! Everybody, quiet!

18:46.993 --> 18:49.894
Something amazing
is about to happen.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.399
How about we lay off Pucker?

18:55.401 --> 18:58.069
Sure, he's not as cool
as the rest of us,

18:58.071 --> 19:00.338
but why don't you
give him a break?

19:00.340 --> 19:04.275
'Cause you might need
one too someday.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.743
Wow.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.347
Showing compassion
to the very lowest of us all.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.351
How heroic can you possibly be?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.187
You know somethin',

19:16.189 --> 19:19.490
deep down,
we're all heroes.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.492
So says...

19:21.494 --> 19:23.060
Falcon.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.465
Falcon's right.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.434
Maybe poor Pucker
just needs a chance.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.503
(students mutter approvingly)

19:32.505 --> 19:36.841
Let's hear it for
the Laser Fair champion.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.678
(cheers and applause)

19:43.516 --> 19:46.450
Was I just saved by Joey?

19:46.452 --> 19:50.188
Did I move to California
or another planet?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.756
(school bell rings)

19:55.628 --> 19:57.662
Hey...

19:57.664 --> 19:59.897
tell the world
what you saw today...

20:01.167 --> 20:04.368
and know that
you never need be afraid.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.110
How cool was all that?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.514
Thanks, Munch.
It's good to know that

20:16.516 --> 20:18.916
at least my big brother has
my back at this new school.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.719
Oh, come on, buddy.
You'd do the same for me.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.055
Sure.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.196
Hey, Ruby, come here.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.932
Okay, Maddie is asleep,
but why didn't you ruin
Velvet Diggie?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.500
I was going to, but--

20:36.502 --> 20:37.768
You know what?
It's okay.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.503
We will ruin
Velvet Diggie tomorrow

20:39.505 --> 20:41.606
and it'll be
our little secret, okay?

20:41.608 --> 20:42.740
Shh!

20:45.111 --> 20:47.578
Oh, hey, Ruby, Ruby, come here.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.349
Dude, Liv totally
didn't notice the painting.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.184
It's gonna be
our little secret, okay?

20:53.186 --> 20:56.487
Shhhhhh!

21:02.462 --> 21:03.995
<i>(scary music plays)</i>

21:25.718 --> 21:27.652
It's not lying,

21:27.654 --> 21:30.488
it's a secret.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.489
-She'll never know.
-Shh!

21:31.491 --> 21:33.457
It's a secret.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.825
Both:
Shhhhh!

21:34.827 --> 21:36.027
Stop!

21:39.932 --> 21:42.600
I can't do it.
I can't keep secrets.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.569
Liv wanted me to destroy
your creepy Velvet Diggie,
but I couldn't do it.

21:45.571 --> 21:48.506
Liv! How could you?

21:48.508 --> 21:51.642
And Liv, I ruined
the<i> Sisters By Chance</i> picture

21:51.644 --> 21:53.511
and wanted to tell you,
but Maddie told me to hide it.

21:53.513 --> 21:57.148
(scoffs)
You were saying, Maddie?

21:57.150 --> 21:59.583
I didn't know sisters had to
lie to each other so much.

21:59.585 --> 22:02.386
I can't. I'm a terrible
sorta little sister.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.324
Dude, two days
as her big sisters,

22:06.326 --> 22:07.658
and we already broke her.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.495
Hey...

22:11.497 --> 22:13.531
Ruby...

22:14.667 --> 22:17.535
you are not terrible.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.103
We are terrible.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.808
Maddie and I can sometimes

22:23.810 --> 22:26.510
make each other do
some really stupid things.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.212
Yeah.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.880
But you know what?
No more lies

22:29.882 --> 22:33.150
because sisters
do not do that.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.485
(door opens)

22:34.487 --> 22:36.687
Girls, help me.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.689
I broke Dina's favorite bowl.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.624
Hide it in here.
I'll fix it tomorrow.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.426
It'll be our secret. Shh!

22:49.001 --> 22:50.468
Sweet!

22:50.470 --> 22:51.836
I feel like
this might even be

22:51.838 --> 22:54.238
a little bit better
than the original.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.640
"Sorta sisters by chance...

22:56.642 --> 22:59.210
"friends by choice."

22:59.212 --> 23:01.979
I feel like this is gonna
be the greatest year ever.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.183
Liv, a package came for you.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.685
It's from Wisconsin.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.553
Oh. That's weird.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.322
I'm definitely
not expecting anything.

23:11.324 --> 23:14.892
Expectations are only
a down payment on resentments.

23:18.931 --> 23:19.997
(screams)

23:21.401 --> 23:23.601
It's a velvet Artie!

23:23.603 --> 23:26.437
Run before it steals your soul!

23:28.875 --> 23:30.641
<i>(scary music plays)</i>

23:31.744 --> 23:32.943
Joey:
<i>They call me Falcon.</i>
