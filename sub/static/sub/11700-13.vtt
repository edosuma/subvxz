WEBVTT

00:01.830 --> 00:03.932
Okay, Emma, let's get these little piggies

00:03.934 --> 00:06.302
into this little pink sparkly market, okay?

00:06.304 --> 00:09.038
Oh, come on, these are too small too.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.281
Hey, if you're not careful,
you're going to be all feet and no head.

00:13.442 --> 00:15.278
Riley was supposed to
take her shoe shopping.

00:15.378 --> 00:17.546
You guys know where she's
been the last couple of days?

00:17.546 --> 00:19.212
I don't know. How should I know?

00:19.312 --> 00:20.436
Don't look at me. I haven't seen her.

00:20.536 --> 00:24.207
Now if you'll excuse me,
my girlfriend's waiting for her coffee.

00:24.207 --> 00:25.408
What's up with him?

00:25.408 --> 00:27.310
What? What? Oh, who, Danny?

00:27.310 --> 00:29.445
Danny? Uh, no, him and Riley had a thing.

00:29.445 --> 00:31.347
You know?
He said something, she said something back.

00:31.347 --> 00:34.150
That pretty much clears it up, right?

00:34.150 --> 00:36.919
I have amazing news!

00:36.919 --> 00:40.857
Evelyn is dead!

00:40.857 --> 00:41.458
What?

00:41.483 --> 00:43.860
Wait, you mean the sweet
old lady across the hall?

00:43.860 --> 00:45.027
Sweet? Please.

00:45.027 --> 00:47.397
Right now she's slow dancing with Satan.

00:50.066 --> 00:53.035
And I am going to pry the
listing for that apartment

00:53.035 --> 00:56.172
out of her cold, gnarled fingers.

00:56.172 --> 00:58.941
Well, I loved Evelyn.

00:58.941 --> 01:01.444
I mean, she used to let me
wonder around her apartment

01:01.444 --> 01:04.513
and put blue stickers on stuff
I could have after she died.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.518
I put stickers all over that place.

01:07.618 --> 01:10.588
I'm gonna be stickin' rich!

01:10.588 --> 01:12.056
You're a horrible person.

01:12.056 --> 01:15.059
Oh, okay, whatever you say,
realtor to the dead.

01:15.059 --> 01:16.227
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:16.227 --> 01:17.561
Can't we just agree

01:17.561 --> 01:20.631
you're both tied in the
horrible department?

01:20.631 --> 01:23.014
How could Riley ignore a
text about shoe shopping?

01:23.114 --> 01:26.651
God, I hope nothing's wrong.
Where the heck is she?

01:27.319 --> 01:29.354
So what do we think?

01:29.354 --> 01:32.490
Can we maybe get up and
put some clothes on today?

01:32.490 --> 01:35.760
Can I bring you a mirror and
show you what's going on here?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.430
Mom, what's the point?

01:38.430 --> 01:41.433
You know, I'd rather just stay
here where no one can see me

01:41.433 --> 01:43.001
and I can't ruin any more lives.

01:43.001 --> 01:44.636
Just mine, honey.

01:44.636 --> 01:47.249
I ruined everything with Ben and Danny.

01:47.349 --> 01:49.384
Oh my God! I thought you were gonna

01:49.384 --> 01:51.353
tell me you were pregnant...

01:51.353 --> 01:53.021
And by a Wheeler!

01:53.021 --> 01:57.092
Mom, I destroyed the relationship

01:57.092 --> 01:59.361
I waited my whole life for with Ben,

01:59.361 --> 02:01.863
and then I ruined the best
friendship I ever had with Danny

02:01.863 --> 02:04.866
by telling him I think
I'm in love with him?

02:04.866 --> 02:08.603
Oh, there's something new and disturbing.

02:08.603 --> 02:11.693
Why don't you go to your apartment
and call me? We can talk about it.

02:11.793 --> 02:14.762
I'm sort of turning this
into a crafting room.

02:14.762 --> 02:17.799
I don't really have an apartment anymore.

02:17.799 --> 02:19.632
I kind of gave up my lease.

02:19.732 --> 02:21.300
What?

02:21.300 --> 02:23.736
Oh, well, okay, maybe we can just

02:23.736 --> 02:26.973
move you into the basement
with your father.

02:26.973 --> 02:31.144
Mom, I just... you know,
I need a fresh start.

02:31.144 --> 02:33.947
A life without the wheelers.
They'll be better off without me.

02:34.047 --> 02:35.515
I agree.

02:35.515 --> 02:37.404
And you know what else
you'll be better off without?

02:37.504 --> 02:39.273
That hairdo.

02:39.273 --> 02:41.308
You kind of look like a lesbian.

02:54.889 --> 02:56.524
All right, thank you.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.825
Okay, well, Riley hasn't

02:57.825 --> 02:58.893
been to work all week,

02:58.893 --> 03:00.995
which her boss now knows.

03:00.995 --> 03:03.531
I may have gotten her in trouble.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.533
Mom, what the hell are you doing?

03:05.533 --> 03:06.534
Waiting for someone

03:06.534 --> 03:07.835
to come claim that old biddy,

03:07.835 --> 03:08.836
so I can get the listing

03:08.836 --> 03:10.838
and cash in.

03:10.838 --> 03:12.940
Ooh! It's showtime!

03:14.775 --> 03:17.278
Hello! I'm Bonnie.

03:17.278 --> 03:19.914
You must be Evelyn's beloved niece.

03:19.914 --> 03:21.015
- Granddaughter.
- Audrey.

03:21.015 --> 03:23.784
- Ashley.
- You sure? I like Audrey better.

03:23.784 --> 03:27.188
Evelyn and I were very close.

03:27.188 --> 03:28.923
I loved her like

03:28.923 --> 03:31.058
she was my own grandma.

03:31.058 --> 03:33.327
She hated you.

03:33.327 --> 03:36.330
Well, who's laughing now, Evelyn?

03:37.798 --> 03:41.002
Again, very sorry for your loss.

03:42.136 --> 03:44.105
Here's my card.

03:44.105 --> 03:45.106
Why don't you let me

03:45.106 --> 03:46.507
help you sell this place?

03:46.507 --> 03:48.142
I think we're good.

03:48.142 --> 03:50.177
Hey, ma, good news.

03:50.177 --> 03:51.412
I just heard that old lady

03:51.412 --> 03:52.446
you hated died!

03:54.882 --> 03:56.918
He's talking about my mother.

03:56.918 --> 03:59.053
Hi, I'm Ashley.

03:59.053 --> 04:00.788
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

04:03.858 --> 04:05.860
Oh my God! Danny Wheeler?

04:05.860 --> 04:07.028
I can't believe grandma never mentioned

04:07.028 --> 04:08.963
she lived across the
hall from a hockey star.

04:08.963 --> 04:11.032
Sweetie, your grandma didn't know

04:11.032 --> 04:13.301
she lived in an apartment.

04:14.535 --> 04:16.536
So are you a hockey fan?

04:16.536 --> 04:18.539
- Yeah, and a Danny Wheeler fan.
- Ah.

04:18.539 --> 04:19.906
I've never missed a game.

04:19.906 --> 04:22.009
I can tell you every
important play he's ever made.

04:22.009 --> 04:24.078
Well, that won't take too long.

04:24.078 --> 04:25.947
How about I make you a deal?

04:25.947 --> 04:28.816
You hook me up with this place

04:28.816 --> 04:30.051
and I'll hook you up

04:30.051 --> 04:31.385
with that face.

04:33.955 --> 04:35.790
Danny?

04:35.790 --> 04:37.959
Danny,
you need to go on a date with that girl

04:37.959 --> 04:40.561
and convince her to give me
the listing to that apartment.

04:40.561 --> 04:43.197
Great, just let me go tell my girlfriend.

04:43.197 --> 04:45.933
Thanks, sweetie. You're a good son.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.970
Mom, I'm not going to break
up with Robyn for you.

04:48.970 --> 04:50.271
Why not?

04:50.271 --> 04:52.873
Robyn is not the right girl for you.

04:52.873 --> 04:56.811
We have nothing in common,
and she never laughs at my jokes.

04:56.811 --> 04:59.480
Neither do I. Maybe you
and I should break up.

05:04.118 --> 05:05.987
Ooh, Ashley!

05:05.987 --> 05:07.788
So you thought things over?

05:07.788 --> 05:10.338
Actually, I'm looking for Tucker Dobbs.

05:10.438 --> 05:12.173
My grandma left something for him.

05:12.173 --> 05:13.210
Oh, I don't think that he's even...

05:13.310 --> 05:15.178
I'm here, I'm here! I'm home, I'm home!

05:15.178 --> 05:19.178
Oh God! I am so sorry. Poor Evelyn.

05:19.316 --> 05:22.586
I... I'm gonna miss her so much.

05:22.586 --> 05:25.322
You know, she was just such a
bright light in my dark...

05:25.322 --> 05:28.191
a shoe box?

05:28.191 --> 05:31.695
Okay,
unless that thing has three mink coats,

05:31.695 --> 05:33.864
two Tiffany lamps,
and an antique vanity mirror,

05:33.864 --> 05:36.333
me and you about to have some words.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.735
Who are you people?

05:40.410 --> 05:42.912
Oh! Nice work.

05:42.912 --> 05:45.849
Could you possibly be any more selfish?

05:45.849 --> 05:48.885
Ooh, is there any chance that
she left you the apartment?

05:48.885 --> 05:50.987
If so, I'd love to represent you.

05:53.123 --> 05:56.660
Oh, hell to the no!

05:58.161 --> 06:01.398
I didn't even put a sticker on this thing.

06:01.953 --> 06:03.855
Oh, my God, wait.
There's something inside of it.

06:03.855 --> 06:05.823
Maybe a key to a safety-deposit box.

06:07.191 --> 06:09.709
Ah, crap. Nothing.

06:11.763 --> 06:13.110
Wait.

06:13.210 --> 06:15.412
Wait, what's this?

06:15.412 --> 06:17.481
"My dear Tucker,

06:17.481 --> 06:19.650
"thank you for making my
final days on this earth

06:19.650 --> 06:22.719
"the best days of my life.

06:22.719 --> 06:25.355
"You were the grandson I never had."

06:27.791 --> 06:30.605
Oh, Evelyn, they took you too soon.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.268
"P.S.,

06:34.353 --> 06:36.021
"tell Bonnie I hate her."

06:36.021 --> 06:38.023
What?

06:38.023 --> 06:41.226
Oh, my God. I just got off the
phone with Riley's landlord.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.228
She gave up her apartment.
She moved back to Jersey.

06:43.228 --> 06:46.699
Nobody moves back to Jersey!

06:50.619 --> 06:52.354
Well, well, well,

06:52.354 --> 06:54.490
if it isn't everyone's favorite delinquent.

06:54.490 --> 06:56.525
Did you come to return my lawn gnome?

06:56.525 --> 06:58.360
That was 15 years ago.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.362
He was part of a pair...

07:00.362 --> 07:02.731
Gnomeo and Juliet.

07:02.731 --> 07:04.310
Okay, well, if it gives you closure,

07:04.410 --> 07:05.978
Gnomeo didn't suffer.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.913
He also didn't float. Is Riley home?

07:07.913 --> 07:09.915
- No!
- Mrs. perrin, please!

07:09.915 --> 07:12.351
Please, I need to talk to her.
I need to know what's wrong.

07:12.351 --> 07:14.153
Really? Haven't you done enough?

07:14.153 --> 07:16.422
No, wait. Haven't I done enough?

07:16.422 --> 07:17.990
Am I why she ran away?

07:17.990 --> 07:18.983
Mrs. perrin!

07:19.083 --> 07:21.219
Please talk to me.

07:26.424 --> 07:28.126
Come on, Danny.

07:28.126 --> 07:30.695
I'm not asking you to sleep with Ashley.

07:30.695 --> 07:32.497
Just make out with her!

07:32.497 --> 07:34.332
You know, maybe a little over-the-bra action

07:34.332 --> 07:35.733
until I get the listing.

07:35.733 --> 07:38.036
Robyn will never know.

07:38.036 --> 07:42.036
Mom,
I am not cheating on my girlfriend for you.

07:42.373 --> 07:45.210
I just did that once so you
could pass your driver's test.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.212
Never again!

07:47.212 --> 07:49.848
Miss Nussbaum still calls me.

07:54.085 --> 07:56.226
- Robyn!
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.

07:56.326 --> 07:57.694
Is Danny ready?

07:57.694 --> 07:58.862
Uh, Danny?

07:58.862 --> 08:01.097
Uh, sick as a dog.

08:01.097 --> 08:02.260
Yeah, in bed.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.863
Pretty serious cold-flu-strep-

08:05.863 --> 08:08.399
phlegmy-stomach-head thingy.

08:08.399 --> 08:10.233
That's horrible. Why didn't he call me?

08:10.333 --> 08:12.468
Uh, because he was too
busy calling the doctor,

08:12.468 --> 08:14.003
the drugstore, and his mother.

08:14.003 --> 08:16.205
Jeez, you are very self-centered.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.274
Yeah, all right,
he will get to you when he can,

08:18.274 --> 08:19.976
- or not, okay?
- Okay.

08:19.976 --> 08:22.511
- Well, tell him if he needs...
- Bye, bye, bye, bye!

08:22.511 --> 08:23.580
Hey, is that Robyn?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.748
Uh, Robyn? Yes.

08:25.748 --> 08:27.484
Yes, it was.

08:27.484 --> 08:31.221
Um, but she got an emergency
phone call from the courthouse.

08:31.221 --> 08:33.789
Either it was a motion she forgot to file

08:33.889 --> 08:35.524
or a file she forgot to motion.

08:35.524 --> 08:39.361
I wasn't really paying attention.
She's very dull.

08:39.361 --> 08:41.395
Wow, so she's standing me up?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.465
I didn't think of that.

08:43.465 --> 08:47.502
Yes. Yes, she is.
You should break up with her!

08:47.502 --> 08:50.639
Oh, Ashley! Huh?

08:50.639 --> 08:53.308
Got a little dinner there? Eating alone?

08:53.308 --> 08:56.511
Sad little to-go box.
Maybe Danny can join you?

08:56.511 --> 08:59.748
These are my grandma's ashes.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.688
Oh. Do you need a hug?

09:01.788 --> 09:03.957
Danny, take your shirt off.

09:03.957 --> 09:06.126
Mom!

09:06.126 --> 09:08.458
Look, Ashley, I'm sorry. You seem...

09:08.558 --> 09:10.293
mom!

09:10.293 --> 09:11.861
You seem like a really nice person,

09:11.861 --> 09:15.131
but I have a girlfriend who
my mom does not approve of.

09:15.131 --> 09:17.267
But you know what?
I don't need her approval.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.269
Right, mom?

09:19.269 --> 09:20.670
Damn.

09:29.113 --> 09:31.281
Ben. Oh, my God.

09:31.281 --> 09:33.651
Ben, what are you doing here?

09:33.651 --> 09:36.153
I'm not allowed to have boys over.

09:36.153 --> 09:37.892
Riley, you can't run away from home.

09:37.992 --> 09:40.461
Well, run away to home... from your home.

09:40.461 --> 09:43.464
Whatever. Riley, you
can't run away from me.

09:43.464 --> 09:45.332
Ben, haven't I done enough damage?

09:45.332 --> 09:48.569
- Oh!
- Oh, Ben!

09:48.569 --> 09:50.971
You have now!

09:50.971 --> 09:53.574
You okay?

09:54.379 --> 09:56.614
Oh, honey, I'm so, so, so sorry.

09:56.614 --> 09:59.283
Are you comfy? Hungry? In pain?

09:59.283 --> 10:02.186
- Ah!
- Oh my God! Are you in pain?

10:02.186 --> 10:03.595
Well, my lawn is.

10:03.695 --> 10:05.564
The lawn is dented.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.567
You dented my lawn.

10:09.023 --> 10:11.025
No, no, no, this is all my fault.

10:11.025 --> 10:13.027
He has to spend the night.
You have to spend the night.

10:13.027 --> 10:15.029
Well, how about we put
him on the curb instead?

10:15.029 --> 10:17.164
I'd say, you know,
we could put him in a white trash bag,

10:17.164 --> 10:19.300
but that's a little redundant.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.069
Mom, could you be cool just, like, once?

10:22.069 --> 10:23.671
You're embarrassing me.

10:23.671 --> 10:27.007
Why don't you go make Ben something to eat?

10:27.007 --> 10:29.043
And I will fix up the guest bedroom for him.

10:29.043 --> 10:32.379
Fine. But if I wake up and
that cat is shaved again,

10:32.379 --> 10:34.982
there will be hell to pay!

10:34.982 --> 10:36.610
I didn't shave that cat.

10:37.525 --> 10:39.560
I waxed it.

10:41.262 --> 10:43.798
Riley, why are you here?

10:43.798 --> 10:45.833
Did you come home because
of what happened between us?

10:45.833 --> 10:48.602
Ben, I really,
I just... I don't want to talk about it.

10:48.602 --> 10:52.673
- Well...
- And please don't touch my beanie babies.

11:01.316 --> 11:03.118
- Hello?
- Danny, hey.

11:03.118 --> 11:05.420
Look, we have a situation.
I need you to ask mom to watch Emma

11:05.420 --> 11:07.222
and get out here a.S.A.P. It's Riley.

11:07.222 --> 11:09.473
Oh. I'm pretty busy right now, Ben.

11:09.573 --> 11:12.275
Okay, whatever you guys are
fighting about right now,

11:12.275 --> 11:13.810
you need to forget it, okay?

11:13.810 --> 11:16.213
We're not fighting.
She just said something I liked

11:16.213 --> 11:18.415
and then said something I didn't like,

11:18.415 --> 11:22.085
so I said... okay, maybe we're fighting.

11:22.085 --> 11:23.553
Danny, you could...

11:26.123 --> 11:27.958
are you okay?

11:27.958 --> 11:30.827
Oh, just... yeah, I'm okay.
I was just trying so hard to walk.

11:30.827 --> 11:32.496
I don't want to be a burden to you, Riley.

11:32.496 --> 11:34.064
- I just...
- Oh, it's okay.

11:34.064 --> 11:35.265
It's okay.

11:37.268 --> 11:39.036
Ooh, ooh, here she is.

11:39.070 --> 11:40.971
Okay, I'm counting on you, Emma.

11:41.005 --> 11:42.940
Okay, you ready? Yeah. Okay.

11:42.974 --> 11:45.843
Oh, Ashley, thank God you're here.

11:45.877 --> 11:46.638
What's wrong?

11:46.663 --> 11:49.680
My son Ben is having some
kind of crisis in Jersey

11:49.714 --> 11:51.982
and he needs me,
but I can't find anybody to watch Emma.

11:52.016 --> 11:54.585
Oh, thank God. Thank you so much.
You're a real life-saver.

11:54.619 --> 11:55.786
Everything you need is right here

11:55.820 --> 11:57.721
and I shouldn't be gone for more than....

11:57.755 --> 11:59.423
So just call me if you got any problems.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.725
- I don't have your num...
- Bye bye now!

12:01.759 --> 12:04.428
Hey, mom, you know where my... oh!

12:04.462 --> 12:06.196
Ashley, um...

12:06.231 --> 12:08.165
I was just, um...

12:08.199 --> 12:10.367
Your mom made me watch her.
She just said no one was in here.

12:10.401 --> 12:12.136
I should get some pants.

12:12.170 --> 12:15.105
So can I ask you a hockey question?

12:15.140 --> 12:17.007
It's a game played on skates

12:17.041 --> 12:19.109
and the object is to get
the puck into the net.

12:19.144 --> 12:20.878
- It's kind of simple.
- No.

12:20.912 --> 12:23.046
The game against the Canucks when
you were robbed of the hat trick?

12:23.081 --> 12:25.015
That's because Horvat tripped you,
wasn't it?

12:25.049 --> 12:27.518
Yeah. Nobody saw that.

12:27.552 --> 12:28.585
I did.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.420
I see everything you do.

12:33.591 --> 12:35.526
Oh my God, you do that too?

12:35.560 --> 12:37.194
You should listen to 2C.

12:37.228 --> 12:38.228
I do.

12:38.263 --> 12:39.363
I think she's leaving Gary.

12:39.397 --> 12:40.497
Well, you know he cheatin'!

12:40.532 --> 12:43.267
With 3B!

12:43.301 --> 12:45.135
Oh, you know what? You can't go in here.

12:45.170 --> 12:46.870
Danny's with Ashley.

12:48.006 --> 12:50.007
Oh, hey, cover for me.

12:50.041 --> 12:51.074
Tucker?

12:56.748 --> 12:58.782
Ahem. If anyone asks,

12:58.816 --> 13:02.386
you have not seen me. I just need to
find somewhere to stash the ashes.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.454
Then I'm giving Evelyn
the funeral she deserves.

13:04.489 --> 13:07.591
- And the coat?
- Hey, I dot it, I got it.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.426
Hi again.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.295
I brought Danny some soup
to make him feel better.

13:11.329 --> 13:12.429
You're too late!

13:12.463 --> 13:14.464
He's, um... he's gone.

13:14.499 --> 13:16.400
What?

13:16.434 --> 13:19.002
It was just a cold!

13:19.037 --> 13:20.871
How could this happen?

13:20.905 --> 13:22.806
Not dead.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.909
He's downstairs doing laundry.

13:25.944 --> 13:27.678
Yeah, yeah, let me show you where he's at.

13:27.712 --> 13:29.846
Oh, thank God you're pretty.

13:31.616 --> 13:33.717
Ben, just let it go, please.

13:33.751 --> 13:36.486
I promise everyone will be
better off without me around.

13:36.521 --> 13:38.255
Nothing will be better without you.

13:38.289 --> 13:40.190
I ruined a perfect friendship.

13:40.225 --> 13:42.192
That's not true.
I'll never stop being your friend.

13:42.227 --> 13:43.393
Actually, I meant...

13:43.428 --> 13:45.195
look, I get it. I messed up.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.331
I pushed you away and now you
don't think we can just be friends.

13:47.365 --> 13:50.133
But we can. I can.

13:50.168 --> 13:52.236
What about Danny?

13:52.270 --> 13:53.837
What about him?

13:53.871 --> 13:55.872
You'll forget about whatever
you're fighting about.

13:55.907 --> 13:57.808
He can't survive without you.

13:57.842 --> 13:58.942
Did he say that?

13:58.977 --> 14:01.545
Yes.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.781
Of course. Totally. Riley, he needs you.

14:04.816 --> 14:07.317
Don't you know that? We all need you.

14:07.352 --> 14:09.253
Really?

14:10.521 --> 14:11.588
Okay.

14:11.623 --> 14:13.190
Okay?

14:13.224 --> 14:15.225
Okay, you'll come back?

14:15.260 --> 14:17.094
All right. Oh, come here!

14:17.128 --> 14:19.096
All right, let me pack your stuff.

14:19.130 --> 14:22.032
All right, you can stay with
us until you find something.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.134
I won't be weird, I promise.

14:25.203 --> 14:28.171
Oh my God.

14:28.206 --> 14:31.808
I'm all healed. It's a miracle.

14:33.858 --> 14:36.320
My God, I can't believe
you just lied to me.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.221
- No, Riley, I...
- No, thank you, thank you

14:38.255 --> 14:40.056
for proving that I made the right decision.

14:40.090 --> 14:40.926
What decision?

14:40.951 --> 14:44.093
There is a position open
at my firm in Buffalo.

14:44.128 --> 14:46.596
You know,
it's the other city that never sleeps.

14:46.630 --> 14:49.699
And I'm taking it. Now go away.

14:49.733 --> 14:53.603
I'll give you a 10-second head start...

14:53.637 --> 14:56.306
Then we'll find out if you float.

14:58.609 --> 15:02.245
Oh, I waxed the cat.

15:11.989 --> 15:15.124
Ah. Oh, look, Danny! Look who's here!

15:15.159 --> 15:18.161
- Oh, now who would put this here? God.
- No!

15:18.195 --> 15:19.762
What?

15:19.797 --> 15:21.998
Oh. Oh, darn it!

15:22.032 --> 15:23.062
Now we're locked in.

15:23.087 --> 15:25.535
Now why would you do that?
Can't you read?

15:25.569 --> 15:26.736
No!

15:26.770 --> 15:28.771
I can't.

15:28.806 --> 15:30.807
And now you're making me feel bad

15:30.841 --> 15:32.742
about my lack of education.

15:34.511 --> 15:38.114
And I got this scar from the Detroit game.

15:38.148 --> 15:40.083
I tripped coming out of the locker room.

15:40.117 --> 15:43.286
Okay, people,
we have an emergency situation.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.089
We need to stage a friend-ervention
and bring Riley home.

15:46.123 --> 15:48.057
Dude, why don't you just leave her alone?

15:48.092 --> 15:50.126
- I know that's my plan.
- She's leaving, Danny.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.028
She's moving to Buffalo.

15:52.062 --> 15:53.863
I tried to stop her,
but she won't listen to me.

15:53.897 --> 15:56.566
Maybe she'll listen to you. Please help me.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.734
It's not that easy.

15:57.768 --> 15:59.769
Yes, it is! She's your best friend.

15:59.803 --> 16:02.372
Oh, you should never fight with friends.

16:02.406 --> 16:04.207
Sometimes they're all you have.

16:04.241 --> 16:05.441
Yeah, what she said.

16:05.476 --> 16:07.343
And who are you?

16:07.378 --> 16:09.379
I'm Evelyn's granddaughter.

16:09.413 --> 16:13.950
Oh. She hated my mom.

16:13.984 --> 16:16.953
Any chance she had a car?

16:20.724 --> 16:22.859
Oh, I swear, I thought we would never

16:22.893 --> 16:24.794
get him back from that firehouse.

16:24.828 --> 16:28.865
You leave one kid in a basket as a joke.
You know, come on!

16:28.899 --> 16:30.533
You're hilarious.

16:30.567 --> 16:31.668
I know.

16:31.702 --> 16:34.470
Oh. You know what, Robyn?

16:34.505 --> 16:36.339
I think I was wrong about you.

16:36.373 --> 16:38.541
I didn't think you and Danny
were right for each other.

16:38.575 --> 16:41.377
Haven't been so sure either,

16:41.412 --> 16:43.379
but after hearing all
these stories about him,

16:43.414 --> 16:46.082
I really want to keep trying.
He really is special.

16:46.116 --> 16:49.886
Yep, and I've got the bus pass to prove it.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.954
Look, I'm sorry I locked you in here

16:51.989 --> 16:53.856
and tried to break you and Danny up.

16:53.891 --> 16:55.858
I just really wanted that apartment listing.

16:55.893 --> 16:58.594
What? You were trying to break us up?

16:59.930 --> 17:01.731
No.

17:01.765 --> 17:05.768
No. No, it's just...
it's one of my stories.

17:05.803 --> 17:08.371
You know? They're not all true.

17:09.606 --> 17:12.541
Oh, do you have any quarters, huh?

17:12.576 --> 17:15.310
That'd be fun, huh?

17:25.923 --> 17:27.990
- Riley!
- Ah, these are mine!

17:28.025 --> 17:29.792
Riley?

17:31.829 --> 17:34.597
Ben?

17:34.631 --> 17:35.698
What are you all doing here?

17:35.733 --> 17:36.833
You can't leave us.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.468
We won't let you.

17:38.502 --> 17:40.737
Okay? Emma needs you.
You're her role model...

17:40.771 --> 17:44.373
You know, when you're not in the
middle of a nervous breakdown.

17:44.408 --> 17:45.575
Who are you?

17:45.609 --> 17:47.343
Oh, I'm Ashley.

17:47.377 --> 17:49.479
My grandma Evelyn lived across
the hall from these guys.

17:49.513 --> 17:52.248
She's dead. I got her car.

17:52.282 --> 17:54.350
Oh, I loved Evelyn.

17:54.384 --> 17:57.920
We used to get together and
complain about Mrs. Wheeler.

17:57.955 --> 18:00.089
Focus, people.

18:00.124 --> 18:01.891
Hey, sorry I'm late.

18:01.925 --> 18:03.726
I was looking for a park for Evelyn.

18:03.761 --> 18:05.027
What are you doing with those ashes?

18:05.062 --> 18:07.630
You may not care about your grandmother,

18:07.664 --> 18:09.799
but I loved her, and she was special to me.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.635
And I'm going to give her
the burial that she deserves.

18:12.669 --> 18:13.770
That's sweet,

18:13.804 --> 18:15.605
but that's not my grandma.

18:15.639 --> 18:18.307
That's her cat, wilton.

18:18.342 --> 18:19.709
Oh.

18:19.743 --> 18:24.113
I guess that explains the bell.

18:24.148 --> 18:27.316
You know, I can see now why she loved you.

18:27.351 --> 18:30.253
I guess that's why she gave you that
figurine worth thousands of dollars.

18:30.287 --> 18:34.190
Our friendship was worth way more than...
what?

18:34.224 --> 18:36.959
Okay, people, can we get
back on track here?

18:36.994 --> 18:39.128
Riley, this is why we need you.

18:39.163 --> 18:41.697
Everyone falls apart without you.

18:41.732 --> 18:42.932
Everyone?

18:42.966 --> 18:45.968
Danny,
she's been there for you your whole life.

18:46.003 --> 18:47.670
Be there for her now.

18:47.704 --> 18:50.640
You don't understand.
I'm still mad about what you said.

18:50.674 --> 18:53.476
Well, I didn't mean to say
what I said when I said it.

18:53.510 --> 18:55.745
But once I felt it, I couldn't not say it.

18:55.779 --> 18:59.248
I don't know what either
one of you are saying.

18:59.283 --> 19:01.384
I'm saying she hurt me.

19:01.418 --> 19:02.518
I'm saying I'm sorry.

19:02.553 --> 19:04.554
And I'm saying get over it.

19:04.588 --> 19:08.057
Can you, Danny? Please?

19:10.460 --> 19:12.295
I guess so.

19:12.329 --> 19:14.363
Really?

19:14.398 --> 19:16.032
Yeah.

19:16.066 --> 19:19.068
I miss my friend. You need to come home.

19:19.102 --> 19:20.436
Okay.

19:20.470 --> 19:23.339
I mean, if that's what you all want.

19:23.373 --> 19:24.974
Wait, really?

19:25.008 --> 19:26.342
It worked?

19:26.376 --> 19:29.011
I did it? I did it!

19:29.046 --> 19:30.112
Yay, me!

19:32.382 --> 19:34.116
Mom.

19:34.151 --> 19:36.986
Uh, did you hear all that?

19:37.020 --> 19:38.354
I sure did, honey.

19:38.388 --> 19:42.024
If you hurry,
I bet you could catch a ride home.

19:42.059 --> 19:43.459
I love you, mom.

19:43.493 --> 19:46.162
I love you too, sweetie.

19:46.196 --> 19:48.164
I took all the candy out of your suitcase.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.742
Look, I just wanted 
to say I'm so happy we're back

19:56.776 --> 19:58.710
to being, well, us,

19:58.745 --> 20:01.780
and I promise I will not interfere
with you and Robyn anymore.

20:01.815 --> 20:04.817
Actually, Robyn and I broke up.

20:04.851 --> 20:05.884
You did?

20:06.920 --> 20:09.054
You did?

20:09.088 --> 20:11.790
It's cool. I'm dating Ashley now.

20:11.825 --> 20:14.660
Well, that was super fast.

20:14.694 --> 20:15.727
But, um, don't worry about me.

20:15.762 --> 20:18.831
I will not interfere with your love life.

20:18.865 --> 20:20.799
In fact, unless you need me,

20:20.834 --> 20:22.701
you won't even notice I'm around, okay?

20:22.735 --> 20:24.870
Okay. Were you able to get a new place?

20:24.904 --> 20:28.006
Yeah, yeah. The location is awesome.

20:29.876 --> 20:32.711
I'll see you around, neighbor.

20:35.748 --> 20:38.817
She rented it to Riley?

20:38.852 --> 20:41.787
Well played, Evelyn.

20:41.821 --> 20:43.055
Well played!

20:43.089 --> 20:44.923
Ah!

20:45.305 --> 20:51.702
