-Mommy: Molly is here.
She's, um, filming.
-  Molly:  Hello!

00:10.251 --> 00:13.669
-Can I open this?
-Molly: Yeah, like Christmas.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.210
I think this is
her head.  (laughing)

00:16.293 --> 00:17.669
Molly:
I like the colors
on her blanket.

00:17.752 --> 00:20.043
Yeah, those are the colors
in my room. It matches.

00:20.126 --> 00:21.293
Molly:
Oh yeah!

00:21.377 --> 00:23.043
Oh my gosh.

00:23.126 --> 00:25.502
Molly:
Oh my gosh,
they look so real.

00:25.585 --> 00:27.335
-Ooh, she feels good.
-  Molly:  Can I touch her?

00:27.418 --> 00:29.210
Yes!  (laughing)

00:29.293 --> 00:30.502
Molly (whispering):
Oh my goodness.

00:30.585 --> 00:32.001
Mommy 2:
Hi, everybody.

00:32.085 --> 00:34.877
I have little Mishka here.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.877
I'm gonna take him shopping.

00:36.960 --> 00:40.335
Look at how cute that is!
It's adorable.

00:40.418 --> 00:44.293
Oh my gosh, I'm buying this.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.919
This little guy is silicone.

00:47.001 --> 00:50.418
So cute, so cute.

00:50.502 --> 00:52.585
Mommy 3:
He's super hungry.

00:52.669 --> 00:54.585
"Oh my gosh, they don't
feed me over there!"

00:54.669 --> 00:56.460
Oh, oh, oh,
burp, burp, burp, burp.

00:56.543 --> 00:58.877
We'll give him back
his pacifier.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.543
He, uh, tends to cry a lot
when he doesn't have it.

01:01.627 --> 01:04.919
Tami:
Welcome back to my channel.
And today, like I told you,

01:05.001 --> 01:07.710
I'll be showing you
a beautiful baby. This is Nico.

01:07.794 --> 01:10.085
Look at those little feet.
If you look at my hands

01:10.168 --> 01:11.919
next to the feet--
look at that detail.

01:12.001 --> 01:13.543
This baby is
well worth a thousand,

01:13.627 --> 01:15.960
but I'll be selling
him for 800.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.627
-Babe.
-Arturo: What?

01:17.710 --> 01:19.001
God, Babe, I'm sleeping.

01:19.085 --> 01:20.960
I know, I know, but I found
one for 800 dollars!

01:21.043 --> 01:23.960
-Babe!
-(Arturo sighs)

01:24.043 --> 01:26.293
-(door closes)
-Adriana: Arturo, I got it!

01:26.377 --> 01:29.251
He's here! Come on!

01:29.335 --> 01:31.752
Come on and film me!

01:31.835 --> 01:35.210
Let me see
what's going in here.

01:35.293 --> 01:37.502
Where's the kid?

01:37.585 --> 01:42.251
Oh my gosh! Arturo,
come here! Look at him!

01:42.335 --> 01:45.418
(gasps)
He's looks so real!

01:45.502 --> 01:47.585
Look at this baby!

01:47.669 --> 01:50.752
(gasps)
Look at you, baby!

01:50.835 --> 01:53.377
Let me fix his hair.
Pretty little guy.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.460
(gasps)
His skin is so soft,
feel it.

01:55.543 --> 01:58.502
Oh my God, look,
his head's gonna fall off.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.960
-Wow, that's so weird.
-Oh my God.

02:01.043 --> 02:03.460
Hey, little guy.

02:03.543 --> 02:05.043
Wow.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.126
Look at you.
So cute.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.377
(Adriana cooing)

02:11.669 --> 02:13.085
Oh shit.

02:13.168 --> 02:15.460
What? What's wrong?

02:15.543 --> 02:18.043
He has a little boo-boo
on his arm. Shit.

02:18.126 --> 02:20.710
-Can you return it? What?
-(Adriana scoffs)

02:20.794 --> 02:23.543
-What if I return you?
-Oh, please. Oh my God.

02:23.627 --> 02:27.335
-Or better yet, your mother.
-Yo, seriously?

02:27.418 --> 02:30.210
-Gonna feed him?
-Hmm?

02:30.293 --> 02:32.293
¿A qué?
Babe, that's stupid.

02:32.377 --> 02:34.293
(Arturo scoffs)

02:34.377 --> 02:35.710
It's not stupid.

02:35.794 --> 02:37.585
Okay, let me get him.

02:37.669 --> 02:40.126
-(cooing): Come here. Come.
-(TV playing indistinctly)

02:40.210 --> 02:42.126
Babe, you gotta be careful.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.293
Watch the baby's head.

02:44.377 --> 02:45.877
Oh.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.085
Why did you unpause?

02:49.168 --> 02:51.043
-It unpaused by itself.
-It did not unpause
by itself.

02:51.126 --> 02:52.835
-Yeah it did--
-Can you rewind?

02:52.919 --> 02:54.377
Good night.

02:55.627 --> 02:57.168
Adriana:
And?

02:57.251 --> 02:59.251
Good night, Baby Nico.

03:01.126 --> 03:03.001
-She bought a condo...
-Arturo: Oh, wow.

03:03.085 --> 03:05.168
-...in Manhatt--
Oh my God, look.
-Look.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.835
-There's baby stuff.
-Yeah.

03:06.919 --> 03:09.418
-I'm gonna check out
these records, ma, okay?
-Okay.

03:09.502 --> 03:11.669
-Oh, babe. Stroller.
-What? Okay.

03:11.752 --> 03:14.794
Oh, look how
cute and tiny!

03:14.877 --> 03:16.251
Oh!

03:16.335 --> 03:18.710
-Thank you.
He's a premie.
-Oh.

03:18.794 --> 03:21.377
That new baby smell.
Can I?

03:24.752 --> 03:26.126
Sure.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.794
(sniffing)

03:31.460 --> 03:34.251
Thank you.
Congratulations.

03:34.335 --> 03:35.418
Thank you.

03:35.502 --> 03:37.293
Oh, I'll bet you want that.
Can I help?

03:37.377 --> 03:39.460
-Yes, thank you
very much.
-Sure.

03:39.543 --> 03:42.669
I can't believe
how cute his nose is.
It's just too cute.

03:42.752 --> 03:45.669
Oh, wow, I can't believe
he's sleeping through
all of this.

03:45.752 --> 03:49.335
Yeah. He was up
all night last night.

03:49.418 --> 03:51.543
-So was I.
-Waitress: I can imagine.

03:51.627 --> 03:53.377
Aw, bless you two.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.669
Go ahead and order
whatever you want for dessert.
It's on me.

03:55.752 --> 03:57.377
-Yeah?
-Word?

03:57.460 --> 03:59.877
Can I get two cannolis?

03:59.960 --> 04:02.043
-My pleasure.
-Arturo: That was nice.

04:02.126 --> 04:03.377
(giggles)

04:03.460 --> 04:05.460
I think he's wet.

04:06.460 --> 04:10.043
You think they have a changing
station in their bathroom?

04:10.126 --> 04:11.585
Arturo:
Really?

04:11.669 --> 04:13.418
Adriana:
You don't want to ask?

04:13.502 --> 04:17.502
-(snoring softly)
-(instrumental music
playing softly)

04:19.835 --> 04:21.543
Mitra:
How do you like it?

04:23.543 --> 04:26.418
Oh shit, I fell asleep.

04:26.502 --> 04:28.251
It's a really good sign.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.752
How long was I out?

04:29.835 --> 04:32.752
Like ten-ish minutes,
maybe?

04:32.835 --> 04:34.460
-Really? (yawns)
-Mm-hmm.

04:34.543 --> 04:36.126
Wow.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.085
And you were
just watching me?

04:38.168 --> 04:39.585
It's my job.

04:39.669 --> 04:42.418
The Guy:
Huh. How'd I do
compared to others?

04:42.502 --> 04:45.126
You have a really
loud nasal flow.

04:46.001 --> 04:47.835
Okay, I didn't know
that. (chuckles)

04:47.919 --> 04:50.085
Well, thanks for that.

04:50.168 --> 04:52.460
Sometimes I dream
about selling weed.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.710
You ever dream about
watching people sleep?

04:54.794 --> 04:58.543
Actually, um,
I'm terrified of sleeping.

05:00.043 --> 05:01.585
Cool. Well, I gotta go.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.418
I hope that indica helps,
and, uh, thank you.

05:04.502 --> 05:07.335
-I'll see you around.
It was nice.
-Okay.

05:09.627 --> 05:11.627
Adriana:
I don't know, I just love
the way he says it.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.877
-(in Irish accent):
"Peaky fuckin' blinders!"
-(laughing): Yo. That's my jam.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.418
-I love that show.
-Oh, you know what?

05:16.502 --> 05:18.627
-We should get some glue
for Baby Nico's boo-boo.
-Yeah?

05:18.710 --> 05:20.168
-Yeah, yeah. Come on.
-All right.

05:23.710 --> 05:25.794
Yo, mami, I don't think
this is gonna fit.

05:25.877 --> 05:27.794
Okay. All right,
I'll go get it.

05:27.877 --> 05:29.418
-You sure?
-Yeah, yeah.
What am I getting?

05:29.502 --> 05:31.960
I don't know, um, get
the automotive epoxy.

05:32.043 --> 05:33.502
-The clear, though.
-Okay, got it.

05:33.585 --> 05:36.168
-Clear!
-You got it. Got it.

05:36.251 --> 05:38.418
(passersby chattering)

05:43.460 --> 05:44.835
(doorbell rings)

05:44.919 --> 05:46.335
The Guy:
Hi, it's me.

05:46.418 --> 05:48.543
(door buzzes)

05:48.627 --> 05:51.085
What did you say
the name was?

05:51.168 --> 05:53.085
Auto epoxy. Auto epoxy.

05:53.168 --> 05:55.001
-You didn't say that.
-That's exactly what I said.

05:55.085 --> 05:56.835
-The clear, though,
get the clear.
-No, you didn't.

05:56.919 --> 05:59.001
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

05:59.085 --> 06:01.251
(distant siren blaring)

06:10.085 --> 06:12.001
Oh, my God.

06:12.085 --> 06:13.960
You poor thing.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.794
Is that your baby?

06:22.919 --> 06:26.085
(muttering):
I'm calling the cops,
this is fucking crazy.

06:26.168 --> 06:29.126
Leaving a baby
on the goddamn street.

06:30.335 --> 06:32.168
Operator (over phone):
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

06:32.251 --> 06:34.585
Yes, I need to report
an unattended infant.

06:34.669 --> 06:36.710
-At the corner
of Jefferson and Wilson.
-Adriana: You left the baby.

06:36.794 --> 06:38.502
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Excuse me!

06:38.585 --> 06:40.543
-Adriana: Excuse you?
-Are you responsible
for this child?

06:40.627 --> 06:42.377
-Yes, this is my baby.
Who the fuck are you?
-Arturo: No.

06:42.460 --> 06:45.543
-Yo, Adi, please. Wait.
-You can't leave a baby
out on the street!

06:45.627 --> 06:47.669
-You should be
ashamed of yourself.
-Arturo: Oh my God.

06:47.752 --> 06:49.877
Why don't you just
mind your own fucking
business, lady?

06:49.960 --> 06:51.669
-Adi, Adi,
por favor, por favor.
-Listen, honey,

06:51.752 --> 06:53.710
-we're just gonna wait here
for the cops to come.
-The cops?!

06:53.794 --> 06:55.627
-Don't touch me, sir!
Back away!
-Adriana: Hey!

06:55.710 --> 06:58.210
He didn't do anything to you!
He didn't do anything!

06:58.293 --> 06:59.919
You came into
our business, all right?

07:00.001 --> 07:02.126
-Adi, por favor.
-No, that's what
white people do!

07:02.210 --> 07:04.627
-White people?
-They come to this neighborhood
and fucking accuse us!

07:04.710 --> 07:06.502
-Do what you gotta do!
-Say what you wanna say,

07:06.585 --> 07:08.585
but I'm not letting you
take a baby

07:08.669 --> 07:10.669
-and leave it out
on the fucking street
-Let's go, let's go. Come on.

07:10.752 --> 07:12.418
-like a piece of trash.
-Get out of our way!

07:12.502 --> 07:14.335
-Yo, come on!
-Get the fuck out of the way!

07:14.418 --> 07:16.418
-Constance:
Is this even your child?
-Arturo: Oh my God!

07:16.502 --> 07:18.752
Bea:
So you jump in a pool,

07:18.835 --> 07:21.210
and instead
of becoming
younger,

07:21.293 --> 07:27.418
you turn into an AI,
and it's Cocoon  but
for millennials.

07:27.502 --> 07:29.627
-What's it called?
- Cocoon.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.168
-(siren chirps)
-What the fuck is that?

07:34.001 --> 07:36.669
(angry shouting outside)

07:36.752 --> 07:39.460
Adriana:
Get the fuck out of my way!
It's people like you--

07:39.543 --> 07:42.043
-Constance: People like me?
-Yeah, it's people like
you accusing us!

07:42.126 --> 07:44.585
-Constance: I'm a citizen
of this fucking country.
-Mind your fucking business!

07:44.669 --> 07:47.126
-Yo, yo, yo, yo!
-Get out of here!

07:47.210 --> 07:49.001
All right, all right.
Who called? Relax.

07:49.085 --> 07:51.960
-This fucking bitch called.
-These fucking lunatics

07:52.043 --> 07:55.877
-left an infant unattended--
-Arturo: It's not a real baby!

07:55.960 --> 07:57.460
Officer: Calm down, man.
Calm down.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.960
Oh my God.
It's a silicone doll, look.

08:00.043 --> 08:02.001
-(crowd murmuring)
-This is what you're
fighting about!

08:02.085 --> 08:03.960
-(gasps)
-It's a silicone doll, look!

08:04.043 --> 08:06.210
-Constance: Oh my God!
-Arturo: That's what
you're fighting about!

08:06.293 --> 08:08.835
-What are you doing?!
-Officer: Relax.
Calm down, calm down.

08:08.919 --> 08:11.335
-Relax, the baby's fake.
-Constance: I should
still press charges.

08:11.418 --> 08:13.335
-Yeah, for what?
-She came at me.

08:13.418 --> 08:15.418
Nah, it doesn't
work like that.

08:15.502 --> 08:17.126
-All right, that's it.
-Constance: Don't touch me.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.585
Officer: Thank you.
Go on your way. Goodbye.

08:18.669 --> 08:20.293
-(Constance muttering):
-Officer: Get out of here.

08:20.377 --> 08:22.460
Adriana:
What the fuck
you looking at?

08:22.543 --> 08:23.919
Show's over!

08:24.001 --> 08:25.835
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

08:25.919 --> 08:29.043
-Arturo: I know, baby--
-How could you hold him
up like that?

08:29.126 --> 08:31.043
You just went like this,
like he was nothing.

08:31.126 --> 08:34.085
I don't know,
I just got heated.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:34.168 --> 08:35.877
I'm sorry, mama.
I'm sorry.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.085
-(sobbing)
-Okay?

08:38.168 --> 08:41.669
(crying):
She thought I was the nanny.

08:41.752 --> 08:44.210
No, you're not the nanny,
mama. You're the mother.

08:44.293 --> 08:46.752
You're the mommy, okay?
You're all right.

08:46.835 --> 08:49.752
It's okay. Okay?

08:51.293 --> 08:53.043
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

08:53.126 --> 08:54.960
All right, let's go, mama.
Let's go.

08:55.043 --> 08:56.502
Come on.

08:56.585 --> 09:00.085
-Adriana: I wanna go home.
-Okay, baby, we'll go home.

09:02.919 --> 09:05.585
Hey! Excuse me.

09:05.669 --> 09:08.168
-I think you dropped this.
-Oh yeah, thank you.

09:08.251 --> 09:09.835
Yeah, man.

09:13.502 --> 09:15.877
Arturo:
All right, baby.
I got you.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.794
I'm here for you.

09:18.669 --> 09:21.085
-(Adriana crying)
-Arturo (softly): Okay.

He just fell asleep.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.627

Yeah.

10:10.835 --> 10:12.669
Good boy.

10:14.502 --> 10:15.710
Okay.

10:30.502 --> 10:32.210
(whispers):
I love you.

10:32.293 --> 10:34.251
I love you, too, babe.

10:38.627 --> 10:40.919
(Adriana humming)

10:43.502 --> 10:48.251
-You think he would've
gotten along with Sammy?
-Yeah, yeah, I do.

11:23.794 --> 11:26.460
(howling)

11:33.251 --> 11:35.919
-You're late.
-Hmm, trains were a mess,

11:36.001 --> 11:37.502
and I'm not that late.

11:37.585 --> 11:39.919
(growling)

11:40.001 --> 11:42.669
-Ana: Didn't you
wear that yesterday?
-I did.

11:42.752 --> 11:44.168
(growling)

11:44.251 --> 11:46.335
Don't you growl
at me. (growling)

11:46.418 --> 11:49.335
-(growling)
-Oh, Eli, buddy. You got
to brush those teeth.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.543
Can you make me
a hot dog for breakfast?

11:51.627 --> 11:53.293
-Poof, you're a hot dog.
-(barks)

11:53.377 --> 11:56.085
-I'll make you
something in a minute.
-(growling)

11:56.168 --> 11:58.126

12:00.001 --> 12:01.585
(knocking)

12:01.669 --> 12:03.293
(man groans)

12:05.752 --> 12:08.627
Morning. It's a beautiful day.

12:08.710 --> 12:11.001
Maybe you should get out
of the house for a bit.

12:11.085 --> 12:13.794
-(groaning)
-Come on.

12:13.877 --> 12:16.710
All right, come on.
Come with me.

12:16.794 --> 12:18.293
Here, do this.

12:18.377 --> 12:20.210
Stretch-- stretch
your arms up.

12:20.293 --> 12:22.627
Take a deep breath.
(inhales)

12:22.710 --> 12:25.460
Ugh, you're the one
that needs the shower.

12:25.543 --> 12:27.877
Well, someone's got
their sense of humor back.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.835
I didn't have
a change of clothes.

12:30.919 --> 12:33.794
-Take one of Margot's.
-Really?

12:33.877 --> 12:36.043
Whatever.

12:55.919 --> 12:57.460
Take that off.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.043
Sorry, I was
just putting--

12:59.126 --> 13:00.377
That's not yours.
Take it off!

13:00.460 --> 13:02.460
-Okay, let me just--
-Take it the fuck off!

13:02.543 --> 13:04.293
Okay!

13:08.001 --> 13:09.919

the A/V situation like?

14:39.669 --> 14:41.835
I guess we could
bring in a projector,

14:41.919 --> 14:44.335
but I don't know where
we'd put it in here.

14:45.377 --> 14:48.877
Hmm, I was thinking that
we would shine the projector

14:48.960 --> 14:50.835
onto the people
on the street as we drive by.

14:50.919 --> 14:54.460

Oh, wow. He's really
getting up in there.

You know what Tolstoy says
about unhappy families?

17:28.377 --> 17:31.585

-The Guy: Don't work for them.

I don't know, this was supposed
to be a temporary gig,

17:35.752 --> 17:38.710
but I don't know
what else to do--

17:38.794 --> 17:40.877
I don't even know what
else I'm qualified to do.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.126

how to talk about it,

-That is exciting!

17:58.126 --> 17:59.669

Well, you should come.

18:13.001 --> 18:14.794
Yeah, sure, maybe.

18:16.001 --> 18:18.126
Are you doing

I was a person coming?

18:39.669 --> 18:42.710
Uh, well,

18:44.669 --> 18:46.669

I'll send you a list

19:18.794 --> 19:20.502

came through.

19:20.585 --> 19:22.960
Oh, good!

19:23.043 --> 19:24.502
How was Bridget's?

19:24.585 --> 19:27.835
Fine. We took some
of Dad's Percocet.

19:34.669 --> 19:36.460
Do you need someone
to talk to?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.126
Oh my God, shut up.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.001
I don't mean me.
I mean someone professional.

no matter
what you do,

19:45.627 --> 19:48.877
he's never gonna put you
in one of his movies.

19:50.794 --> 19:53.877
And no one cares about
your stupid little dances.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.418
And you're never gonna
have any friends,

19:58.502 --> 20:00.460
'cause you're
a nasty little bitch.

20:00.543 --> 20:02.335

See you guys later.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.418
Hey, did you tell her?

20:04.502 --> 20:06.919
In two weeks, how would
you like to go to Cairo?

20:07.001 --> 20:08.877
It'll be two to three
months, maybe four.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.502
Obviously,
we don't want that.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.293
I'll have a house,
and there'll be
a room for you.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.085
You can take
the kids around.

20:14.168 --> 20:16.585
Or if there's a tutor--
Maybe you can do that,
I don't know.

20:16.669 --> 20:19.418
It's all just
happening so fast.
