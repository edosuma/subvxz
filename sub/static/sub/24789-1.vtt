02:14.541 --> 02:15.807
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:29.341 --> 02:30.472
Mom?

02:30.474 --> 02:33.205
It's me.
You ready?

02:33.207 --> 02:35.839
Jane will be
here any minute.

02:35.841 --> 02:37.142
I made a
cake for dad.

02:50.974 --> 02:52.775
Oh, God. Is
this a joke?

03:02.007 --> 03:03.974
- Will.
- Hey, Lillian.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.806
I'm glad I
got you alone.

03:07.808 --> 03:10.205
I wanted to tell you
that if you guys get busy

03:10.207 --> 03:11.872
with your mom
at the hospital,

03:11.874 --> 03:13.472
I'm more than happy
to look in on your dad.

03:13.474 --> 03:15.173
- But they're not here.
- What?

03:15.175 --> 03:17.471
The house is empty.
I tried to call, but...

03:17.473 --> 03:20.205
I think mom's turned off
the cell phone we bought her.

03:20.207 --> 03:22.173
Come to think of it,
I heard someone

03:22.175 --> 03:25.272
turning on an engine
this morning very early.

03:25.274 --> 03:27.141
What engine? Dad's
car's right here.

03:28.807 --> 03:30.407
Oh...

03:33.841 --> 03:36.109
- Oh, my God.
- I don't believe it.

03:37.974 --> 03:40.539
Jane. Mom
and Dad are gone.

03:40.541 --> 03:42.838
And you won't
believe it.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.239
So is the
Leisure Seeker.

03:58.573 --> 03:59.808
Take a right here.

04:03.074 --> 04:04.741
That's it. Good.

04:09.873 --> 04:14.139
Couldn't you have worn something
more comfortable to travel in?

04:14.141 --> 04:17.440
And I think you've exaggerated
a bit with the eau de cologne.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.075
But you do
smell nice.

04:28.908 --> 04:30.174
- Darling?
- Mmm-hmm?

04:31.207 --> 04:32.340
Did you fart?

04:33.107 --> 04:34.372
Excuse me?

04:34.374 --> 04:36.872
You did.

04:36.874 --> 04:39.106
I did not.

04:39.108 --> 04:41.508
You can't be talking like that.
What are you saying?

04:58.306 --> 05:00.841
Hon, do we
need gas?

05:02.941 --> 05:04.906
We need gas.

05:04.908 --> 05:06.539
Let's stop
at Stuckey's.

05:06.541 --> 05:09.006
We could get one
of those pecan logs.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.438
- Where?
- Our Stuckey's, hon.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.072
Try to remember.

05:13.074 --> 05:14.475
Okay, boss.

05:15.407 --> 05:17.305
Just as you say.

05:17.307 --> 05:19.071
Like always.

05:19.073 --> 05:20.571
Yeah, right.

05:20.573 --> 05:24.039
<i>♪ You have no
place for us</i>

05:24.041 --> 05:27.571
<i>♪ In your reverie</i>

05:27.573 --> 05:30.941
<i>♪ Goodbye, my love... ♪</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.241
Hey, are you crazy?

05:42.073 --> 05:44.005
Is the store closed?

05:44.007 --> 05:46.972
Oh, we really wanted one
of your delicious pecan logs.

05:46.974 --> 05:50.572
- Opening soon. Just gas now.
- Oh, no. You hearing this, hon?

05:50.574 --> 05:54.337
Every summer, we'd head south,
we always stopped at Stuckey's.

05:54.339 --> 05:57.505
Our kids, Jane and Will, they just
had to have their pecan logs.

05:57.507 --> 06:00.971
We were visiting my family in South
Carolina. That's where I'm from.

06:00.973 --> 06:04.839
My husband John, on the other hand,
he's a real Yankee, born and bred.

06:04.841 --> 06:08.871
- Uh, okay.
- Oh, they were wonderful trips, weren't they, John?

06:08.873 --> 06:11.304
Well, I guess I'm just
a natural born tourist.

06:11.306 --> 06:13.304
I love to travel.

06:13.306 --> 06:16.238
Smoky Mountains,
Six Flags, Williamsburg.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.105
You ever been to
any of these places?

06:18.107 --> 06:20.271
- We're from Syria.
- You are?

06:20.273 --> 06:22.039
Oh, how interesting.

06:22.041 --> 06:24.939
Well, you should go.
They are amazing.

06:24.941 --> 06:27.504
- Ninety one dollars, ma'am.
- Yes, of course.

06:27.506 --> 06:29.571
My husband John, on
the other hand,

06:29.573 --> 06:32.806
he's a much more sophisticated
traveler than I am.

06:32.808 --> 06:36.106
He thinks travel should "broaden
the intellectual horizons,"

06:36.108 --> 06:39.005
whatever that's
supposed to mean.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.538
I just love chatting
with different people.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.806
Here.

06:42.808 --> 06:44.237
There you are.

06:44.239 --> 06:46.172
- Have a nice trip.
- Let's roll, hon.

06:46.174 --> 06:47.507
Nice visiting with you.

06:54.974 --> 06:57.071
Wait, wait,
wait. Wait, wait.

06:57.073 --> 07:00.005
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.

07:00.007 --> 07:02.841
What a nice woman. She found
one in the storeroom.

07:04.107 --> 07:06.139
Its expiration date is,

07:06.141 --> 07:09.205
oh, my goodness, last April.

07:09.207 --> 07:12.805
I think it'll still be all right.
Would you like a little taste, hon?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.071
I want a burger.

07:14.073 --> 07:15.374
It's not lunchtime yet.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.408
I want a burger.

07:30.507 --> 07:33.006
Hi. My name is Chantal,
and I'll be your server.

07:33.008 --> 07:34.237
Hi, Chantal.

07:34.239 --> 07:35.806
I'm Ella. This is John.

07:35.808 --> 07:37.304
Guess you're stuck with us.

07:37.306 --> 07:39.504
- I want a burger.
- Might I recommend the Chow Attack?

07:39.506 --> 07:41.504
Only $9.99. That comes
with a burger,

07:41.506 --> 07:44.571
large fries, a slice of apple
pie and a Happy Swirl.

07:44.573 --> 07:46.504
"A Happy Swirl"?

07:46.506 --> 07:49.571
I have no idea what that could be,
but it sure sounds promising.

07:49.573 --> 07:51.538
- I want a burger.
- So we'll have

07:51.540 --> 07:54.205
a Chow Attack
for Mr. Grumpy here.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.938
Okay. And you, madam?

07:55.940 --> 07:58.105
- Just water.
- Nothing to eat?

07:58.107 --> 08:00.971
I'll just take a little sip
of his Happy Swirl.

08:00.973 --> 08:03.939
Okay. Would you like anything
else to drink? Coke? Beer?

08:03.941 --> 08:06.539
- No, that'll be fine, thank you.
- I want a burger.

08:06.541 --> 08:10.039
- Burger, please.
- Uh, that'll be all, Chantal. Thank you.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.373
You're so welcome.

08:16.406 --> 08:18.205
I'm just gonna
stretch my legs.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.405
- You stay put.
- Okay.

08:20.407 --> 08:21.441
Okay.

08:22.273 --> 08:23.474
Do not move.

08:39.541 --> 08:41.236
I know,
Dr. Tomashevski.

08:41.239 --> 08:43.171
I'm fully aware.

08:43.173 --> 08:45.204
I'm not sure
what else to say.

08:45.206 --> 08:47.372
I'm just hoping that
they haven't gone too far.

08:47.374 --> 08:49.808
I understand.

08:50.473 --> 08:52.971
Okay.

08:52.973 --> 08:55.107
Doctor, my brother just pulled up. We'll
let you know if we hear anything.

08:57.106 --> 08:59.237
- Any news?
- So?

08:59.239 --> 09:00.938
I checked all
the supermarkets.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.338
Nothing.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.404
I seem to remember
it was your brilliant idea

09:04.406 --> 09:06.504
that they keep
that monstrosity.

09:06.506 --> 09:08.070
Nice work, kiddo.

09:08.072 --> 09:10.071
There has to be
some sort of explanation.

09:10.073 --> 09:12.171
- Yeah. They ran away.
- But from who?

09:14.574 --> 09:15.971
- Hello?
- <i>Will.</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:17.472
Mom, where the
fuck are you?

09:17.474 --> 09:20.305
Will, honey, please don't use
that language with me.

09:20.307 --> 09:22.338
- Never mind the language.
- You need to calm down.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.237
If you raise your
voice, I'll hang up.

09:24.239 --> 09:25.906
Mom, what is
this craziness?

09:25.908 --> 09:28.304
You knew I was coming to get
you. Why are you not here?

09:28.306 --> 09:31.405
We're just taking a little trip, Jane.
We won't be gone long.

09:31.407 --> 09:33.905
"A little trip"? Where?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.839
This is just something I really
need to do with your father.

09:36.841 --> 09:39.172
I can't believe this.
We decided everything.

09:39.174 --> 09:41.438
Will was gonna stay with dad.
I was gonna come...

09:41.440 --> 09:43.205
<i>Your father and I didn't
decide a thing.</i>

09:43.207 --> 09:46.037
You and Will and those quack
doctors did that for us.

09:46.039 --> 09:48.806
That is the basis
of Hemingway's narrative.

09:48.808 --> 09:50.571
James Joyce saw
the beauty of it.

09:50.573 --> 09:53.404
Joyce acclaimed him,
called him a giant.

09:53.406 --> 09:56.338
But not here. Not in America.

09:56.340 --> 09:58.504
Here, we praise the hell out
of our brilliant darlings,

09:58.506 --> 10:00.571
and then we kill them.

10:00.573 --> 10:02.938
You tell dad to turn that jalopy
around and get right back home.

10:02.940 --> 10:05.872
Try to understand. Just let me have
this vacation with your father.

10:05.874 --> 10:07.505
"Vacation."
Now it's a vacation.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.171
You know full well that dad
can't drive in his condition.

10:10.173 --> 10:13.872
Your father's perfectly capable of driving.
He's doing very well.

10:13.874 --> 10:17.038
Mom, please, at least
just keep the cell phone on.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.775
Kids, we'll manage.

10:19.307 --> 10:20.307
We love you.

10:21.907 --> 10:24.272
- Where are they?
- I have no idea.

10:24.274 --> 10:25.971
No idea, Lillian.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.974
...that when we die,
who we are ends.

10:29.573 --> 10:30.871
This is it.

10:30.873 --> 10:31.973
That's all there is.

10:33.072 --> 10:35.871
It's so beautifully crafted.

10:35.873 --> 10:37.371
It's a work of poetry.

10:37.373 --> 10:39.305
And it's prose.

10:39.307 --> 10:42.272
Prose that is poetry.

10:42.274 --> 10:45.105
No, yeah, I could
see that, definitely.

10:45.107 --> 10:47.504
You can just ignore
him, you know.

10:47.506 --> 10:50.572
Oh, no, it's super interesting.
He's being very nice.

10:50.574 --> 10:54.070
Prose that is poetry
is Hemingway's secret.

10:54.072 --> 10:57.205
Do you have any idea how
difficult that is to do?

10:57.207 --> 10:58.305
For sure.

10:58.307 --> 11:00.871
John, leave the
poor girl alone.

11:00.873 --> 11:03.037
No, but it means, because
people have confused

11:03.039 --> 11:06.906
his simplicity, his economy
of word, with banality.

11:06.908 --> 11:08.572
- Have you read...
- You want any special sauces

11:08.574 --> 11:10.337
- for your burger?
- No, no, we'll be fine.

11:10.339 --> 11:13.838
- Thank you, Chantal. Thank you.
- Enjoy.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.571
I just wanted to ask her if she'd
read <i>The End of Something.</i>

11:16.573 --> 11:19.005
John, eat.

11:19.007 --> 11:20.504
You want me to
cut it up for you?

11:20.506 --> 11:22.070
No, not necessary.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.338
Don't forget your pills.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.407
Oh.

11:26.307 --> 11:28.174
- How is it?
- Mmm.

11:29.574 --> 11:31.308
And now yours.

11:35.874 --> 11:39.374
I'm gonna chase mine
with this famous Happy Swirl.

11:44.174 --> 11:46.405
I don't see how you
can just sit there eating.

11:46.407 --> 11:48.138
We should call the police

11:48.140 --> 11:50.372
and get Andy to track
their credit card spending.

11:50.374 --> 11:53.205
Hopefully, mom hasn't lost
her marbles now as well.

11:53.207 --> 11:56.305
Maybe they're just out for a short spin.
I mean, where are they gonna go?

11:56.307 --> 11:59.104
The camper needs
to be serviced, Jane.

11:59.106 --> 12:01.572
What if there's an accident?
What if someone sues dad?

12:01.574 --> 12:04.274
We need to figure out where
they're going and intercept them.

12:05.940 --> 12:07.440
And yet she continues to eat
as if it's nothing.

12:17.507 --> 12:19.838
Everybody came to
my cousin's wedding.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.104
They sat us at that great big
table next to the picture window.

12:24.106 --> 12:26.108
Now, who was there?
Do you remember?

12:28.140 --> 12:29.272
Me?

12:29.274 --> 12:31.038
Yes, John.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.272
You were there and I was
there and the kids were there.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.374
Do you remember?

12:35.306 --> 12:37.970
Oh, God.
Oh. Oh.

12:37.972 --> 12:40.005
Oh, God.

12:40.007 --> 12:41.040
We're fine.

12:43.006 --> 12:45.572
John, that was amazing.

12:48.340 --> 12:51.304
- I can still do it, can't I?
- Yes, you can.

12:51.306 --> 12:52.938
Okay. Here, here.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.837
Look. You take that road.

12:54.839 --> 12:56.337
Ol' Route One.

12:56.339 --> 12:58.973
We must have driven
that a thousand times.

13:00.339 --> 13:02.070
We're heading south?

13:02.072 --> 13:03.475
That's the plan.

13:04.939 --> 13:06.073
To your people.

13:07.473 --> 13:09.038
What people, John?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.341
My parents are dead.

13:12.474 --> 13:14.071
They're all dead?

13:14.073 --> 13:17.971
I wonder what
it's like up there.

13:17.973 --> 13:21.504
If it's a joyful place,
all singing and dancing

13:21.506 --> 13:24.041
and Happy Swirls
all day long.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.237
What do you think, John?

13:29.239 --> 13:31.173
What it's like,
you know, after.

nothin' if it ain't free ♪</i>

14:22.839 --> 14:24.472
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:24.474 --> 14:26.371
- Hi. Welcome.
- We registered online.

14:26.373 --> 14:27.841
Name is Spencer.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.471
Come along, my darling.

14:52.473 --> 14:53.538
Ah, perfect.

14:53.540 --> 14:54.840
Perfect, perfect.

14:55.406 --> 14:56.440
Good.

14:58.474 --> 14:59.774
- You ready?
- Yeah.

15:01.872 --> 15:03.407
- Yeah. That's good.
- Thank you.

15:08.039 --> 15:09.073
Watch your head.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.372
Come on, guys.

15:36.374 --> 15:37.505
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:37.507 --> 15:38.807
- Hi.
- Hello there.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.838
Whoa.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.472
Check it out.

15:47.474 --> 15:50.305
'75 Winnebago Indian.

15:50.307 --> 15:51.905
It's a gift from my parents.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.904
I named it the
Leisure Seeker.

15:55.307 --> 15:57.204
My husband hated it at first.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.973
He thought it was
kind of low-class.

16:00.006 --> 16:01.804
But he kind of got used to it.

16:01.806 --> 16:04.105
We've had a lot of wonderful
trips in this old rust bucket.

16:04.107 --> 16:05.571
Look at this old
beauty, babe.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.271
- Look.
- Yeah, it's great.

16:07.273 --> 16:08.870
So, have you folks been
on the road long?

16:08.872 --> 16:10.804
No, we just started.
We're headed south

16:10.806 --> 16:12.837
down to where I grew up between
Charleston and Savannah.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.871
- Oh, it's so beautiful down there.
- It is. It's beautiful.

16:15.873 --> 16:18.138
We'd always go
there on vacation,

16:18.140 --> 16:21.271
but this time we're going further
south, all the way to the Florida Keys.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.205
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:23.207 --> 16:27.005
I'm finally taking John to see
Hemingway's house in Key West.

16:27.007 --> 16:28.305
You ever been there?

16:28.307 --> 16:30.037
No, we haven't.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.237
Hemingway was a Confederate
general, right?

16:32.239 --> 16:34.238
No, silly, he was a writer.

16:35.507 --> 16:38.504
Didn't he commit suicide?

16:38.506 --> 16:39.504
He did.

16:39.506 --> 16:42.272
And I never understood why.

16:42.274 --> 16:45.405
John knows all about him. He's
always wanted to see that house.

16:45.407 --> 16:47.437
Every year, I'd promise
him we'd go,

16:47.439 --> 16:50.171
but you know how it is
traveling with little kids.

16:50.173 --> 16:52.172
We've seen Melville's place.

16:52.174 --> 16:54.338
That's near to where we live.
He's a writer, too, you know.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.571
He wrote <i>Moby Dick.</i>

16:55.573 --> 16:58.037
Very, very interesting.

16:58.039 --> 17:02.104
Actually, it was a pain in the
rear for my son Will and me.

17:02.106 --> 17:04.837
- But my daughter Jane, she loved it.
- Mom! Dad!

17:04.839 --> 17:07.003
I think that's why
she became a professor.

17:07.006 --> 17:09.005
My husband, John,
is so proud of her.

17:09.007 --> 17:11.070
But my son Will,
on the other hand,

17:11.073 --> 17:13.539
you know, he's still
struggling to find his way.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.904
- He just doesn't know what he...
- Where are we?

17:16.906 --> 17:20.505
- We're not home.
- No, hon. We live in Massachusetts.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.805
This is Pennsylvania.

17:22.807 --> 17:25.837
What the dickens are
we doing in Pennsylvania?

17:25.839 --> 17:28.304
We're on vacation, and we're
having a whale of a time.

17:28.306 --> 17:29.870
Yeah.

17:29.872 --> 17:31.504
Not me. I want a cup of tea.

17:31.506 --> 17:33.937
This is my husband John.
John, these are our neighbors.

17:33.939 --> 17:36.005
- Hate to say it, but we...
- It's getting really late.

17:36.007 --> 17:37.938
It's, uh... We gotta put
the kids to sleep.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.838
- Bedtime stories.
- Maybe another time.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.004
Good night. Say
goodbye, John.

17:42.006 --> 17:43.570
I want a cup of tea.

17:43.572 --> 17:44.473
Well...

17:46.440 --> 17:48.537
I'll make your tea
when I'm good and ready.

17:48.539 --> 17:50.273
I'm quite comfortable
sitting here.

17:51.407 --> 17:52.870
I want it now.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.174
You'll only be
up peeing all night.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.570
- I want a cup of tea.
- Shh.

17:59.572 --> 18:01.870
We're not the only ones here.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.471
If you want a cup of tea,
you go and make it yourself.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.507
You're not an invalid.

18:08.173 --> 18:11.006
That is exactly
what I will do.

18:25.374 --> 18:26.408
Hey, darling.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.341
Would you like
a cup of tea?

18:30.240 --> 18:31.274
I give up.

18:38.939 --> 18:39.974
Drink that.

18:49.174 --> 18:50.208
Into bed.

19:01.406 --> 19:02.904
You coming?

19:02.906 --> 19:03.941
In a minute.

20:20.972 --> 20:22.007
Bye-bye.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.870
Good morning,
Johnny, my love.

20:43.872 --> 20:44.974
How are you, honey?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.373
Goodness me.

20:48.573 --> 20:51.272
It occurred to me this morning

20:51.274 --> 20:53.274
that I should replace
the water filter.

20:54.406 --> 20:55.773
So I did

20:56.873 --> 20:58.271
and then I didn't.

21:00.405 --> 21:04.805
I mean, the darned thing was as
clean as a whistle. It's amazing.

21:04.807 --> 21:07.305
And once again, I
was compelled to admit

21:07.307 --> 21:11.538
that this old contraption
isn't all bad.

21:11.540 --> 21:16.137
I mean, of course there are infinitely
better means of transportation,

21:16.139 --> 21:18.171
but there is no
denying that one gets

21:18.173 --> 21:21.971
an exceptional sleep
on that stupid bed.

21:21.973 --> 21:25.271
What about you, my princess? Do you
feel any peas under the mattress?

21:25.273 --> 21:26.371
No.

21:29.173 --> 21:32.137
I'm so happy when
you come back to me.

21:32.139 --> 21:35.174
I was only just outside
the door, sweetheart.

21:36.972 --> 21:38.306
- You have pain?
- No.

21:39.305 --> 21:40.471
Good.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.004
Where are we exactly?

21:42.006 --> 21:44.270
Chester County, south
of Philadelphia.

21:44.272 --> 21:46.005
- Chester County.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:46.007 --> 21:48.504
One of Penn's
three counties.

21:48.506 --> 21:51.773
I am so glad to be back
on the road again.

21:54.839 --> 21:56.240
Let me make you
a cup of coffee.

22:10.174 --> 22:11.440
John?

22:12.906 --> 22:13.973
What's happening?

22:16.840 --> 22:18.108
Where are we?

22:20.072 --> 22:23.270
It's so nice when you
forget to be forgetful.

22:23.272 --> 22:25.239
Too bad it ends so quickly.

22:26.338 --> 22:28.538
I just can't get used to it.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.941
What are you saying?

22:31.139 --> 22:33.174
Nothing. I'll make the coffee.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.373
You should get
dressed, my love.

22:43.839 --> 22:46.473
- Come on, slowpoke.
- I'll go. I'll go.

23:08.139 --> 23:10.503
How about we stop
at old Chesapeake?

23:10.505 --> 23:13.506
The children used to love that,
and you didn't mind it so much.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.571
Old what?

23:16.573 --> 23:20.108
That, uh, historical
village in, in Virginia.

23:21.439 --> 23:23.537
Maybe Dan isn't after all.

23:23.539 --> 23:25.506
Hmm? What are
you talking about?

23:27.572 --> 23:29.337
He's not dead, is he?

23:29.339 --> 23:31.173
- Who?
- Dan.

23:32.373 --> 23:34.571
Oh, my God.

23:34.573 --> 23:37.271
You mean Daniel Coleman?

23:39.040 --> 23:42.470
What is going on
in that mind of yours?

23:42.472 --> 23:44.804
You're just like Gretta.

23:44.806 --> 23:47.838
- Gretta?
- "Yes, the newspapers were right.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.304
"Snow was general
all over Ireland.

23:50.306 --> 23:52.970
"It was falling on every part
of the dark central plain."

23:52.972 --> 23:54.804
All right, all
right. I get it.

23:54.806 --> 23:56.171
The story by Melville.

23:56.173 --> 23:59.237
Joyce. The beautiful
James Joyce.

23:59.239 --> 24:02.271
I'm glad you can
at least remember something.

24:02.273 --> 24:03.741
Gretta Conroy.

24:04.505 --> 24:06.471
You're just like her.

24:06.473 --> 24:09.904
You thought of
him your entire life.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.437
What on Earth are
you talking about?

24:12.439 --> 24:13.873
We'd go to Charleston

24:15.040 --> 24:17.570
and you'd sneak
off to Savannah

24:17.572 --> 24:20.073
saying you were
going to see your aunt.

24:21.472 --> 24:24.271
I don't believe this.

24:24.273 --> 24:27.436
I mean, if Daniel Coleman is
alive, and that's a big if,

24:27.438 --> 24:31.970
he's been living in Daytona
for the past 30 years.

24:31.972 --> 24:34.073
Daniel Coleman. Honestly.

24:39.807 --> 24:41.140
Ella, where's my gun?

24:44.139 --> 24:46.807
Uh, we... We didn't
bring the gun.

24:49.205 --> 24:50.904
We didn't?

24:50.906 --> 24:53.937
No. No, we definitely
did not bring the gun.

24:53.939 --> 24:55.306
But we always do.

24:56.173 --> 24:57.470
Fire.

25:01.238 --> 25:04.104
Right face. March.

25:04.106 --> 25:08.070
Two people, single day.
That'll be $88, ma'am.

25:08.072 --> 25:10.005
Goodness, you've
become pricey.

25:10.007 --> 25:12.070
It's $40.99 per
ticket, plus taxes.

25:12.072 --> 25:15.904
When we used to come here with the kids,
it was $10 for the day.

25:15.906 --> 25:18.070
When was this? Back
when we were a colony?

25:18.072 --> 25:20.173
Oh, ha-ha. Very funny.

25:21.372 --> 25:22.538
What an asshole.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.971
Uh, enjoy your visit.

25:24.973 --> 25:26.406
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

25:28.472 --> 25:30.537
Did you call
him an asshole?

25:30.539 --> 25:32.370
No, no. I just said,

25:32.372 --> 25:34.171
"Ah, so..."

25:48.373 --> 25:50.404
Let's go
see the library.

25:50.406 --> 25:51.974
You used to love that.

25:56.038 --> 25:57.172
Mr. Spencer?

25:57.972 --> 25:58.906
Mr. Spencer.

26:00.339 --> 26:03.171
It's me, Jennifer Ward,
class of '93.

26:03.173 --> 26:05.805
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, miss.

26:05.807 --> 26:08.271
- I'm afraid my husband...
- Jenny Ward?

26:08.273 --> 26:09.905
It's you.

26:09.907 --> 26:11.807
How the devil are you?

26:12.372 --> 26:14.304
I'm so...

26:14.306 --> 26:16.070
So happy to see you.

26:16.072 --> 26:19.137
How did you do at Columbia?
Oh, you've graduated by now.

26:19.139 --> 26:22.069
Oh, yeah. Gosh, I...

26:22.071 --> 26:23.871
I can't believe
you remember me.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.137
I can't believe it either.

26:26.139 --> 26:27.905
A lot has happened since then.

26:27.907 --> 26:32.003
Um, Michael, Emily, this
is Mr. Spencer.

26:32.005 --> 26:35.437
The most inspiring
teacher I ever had.

26:35.439 --> 26:38.941
- Hello, Mr. Spencer.
- Hi, Emily. Hi, Michael.

26:40.939 --> 26:43.437
Well, what was the name
of that friend of yours?

26:43.439 --> 26:45.804
Oh, uh, yeah. Uh,
Lauren Mitchell.

26:45.806 --> 26:47.504
Lauren... That's
it. That's it.

26:47.506 --> 26:50.370
The two of you, you were
always laughing and...

26:50.372 --> 26:53.304
- Gosh.
- Yeah. Yeah, we were.

26:53.306 --> 26:55.938
I'm sorry if I
disturbed you. I...

26:55.940 --> 26:57.306
I'm just so happy to see you.

26:58.273 --> 27:00.404
Oh, me too, Jenny.

27:00.406 --> 27:01.741
Me too.

27:03.105 --> 27:05.073
Bye, Michael. Bye, Emily.

27:06.506 --> 27:07.905
Bye, Jenny.

27:07.907 --> 27:10.904
"Me too, Jenny. Me too."

27:10.906 --> 27:13.437
I mean, you can't remember
the names of your own kids,

27:13.439 --> 27:16.436
but you do remember that
Jenny was always laughing.

27:16.438 --> 27:19.069
I'm, I'm speechless.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.403
I mean, what goes on
in that head of yours?

27:21.405 --> 27:24.236
She was such a good student.

27:24.238 --> 27:26.340
Oh, well, that
explains it all.

28:08.505 --> 28:10.805
Hey, hon.

28:10.807 --> 28:15.904
Did you know that Tennessee Williams
had a house in Key West, too?

28:15.906 --> 28:19.037
Uh, wasn't he one of those
writers you really loved?

28:19.039 --> 28:21.473
I think you took me
to see one of his plays.

28:22.372 --> 28:24.170
John, you hear me?

28:24.172 --> 28:27.037
Though I preferred the movie
with Marlon Brando.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.004
God, he was gorgeous.

28:29.006 --> 28:30.172
Ella, where are the kids?

28:31.139 --> 28:32.240
They're at home.

28:33.105 --> 28:34.970
At home?

28:34.972 --> 28:37.471
We left the kids at
the house, on their own?

28:37.473 --> 28:39.937
I don't believe it. What in
God's name have we done?

28:39.939 --> 28:42.236
John, they're all grown up.

28:42.238 --> 28:46.171
They're almost old. They'll be fine.
They've got their own lives.

28:46.173 --> 28:47.937
- Seriously?
- Yes.

28:47.939 --> 28:50.004
Jane is married to Phillip.

28:50.006 --> 28:53.137
She teaches college. They've got
two kids, a boy and a girl.

28:53.139 --> 28:56.072
- Really?
- Rosie and Stephen.

28:57.439 --> 28:59.903
Rosie and Stephen.

28:59.905 --> 29:03.104
They're toddlers, right?
And they're very cute.

29:03.106 --> 29:06.040
Stephen's 19,
Rosie's 21.

29:07.939 --> 29:11.337
Don't you remember we went
to her high school graduation?

29:11.339 --> 29:15.069
Rosie made a wonderful speech
and Stephen played in the band.

29:15.071 --> 29:16.506
You were very moved by it.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.240
Stephen played in the band

29:21.139 --> 29:22.107
and...

29:23.138 --> 29:25.237
Rosie made a wonderful speech.

29:25.239 --> 29:26.774
Oh, you do remember.

29:28.038 --> 29:30.470
No, I don't.

29:30.472 --> 29:33.503
It's so painful when you
don't remember anything.

29:33.505 --> 29:37.870
I'm sick and tired of having to
remember everything for you.

29:37.872 --> 29:39.239
Forgive me, Ella. Forgive me.

29:40.871 --> 29:42.436
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:42.438 --> 29:45.903
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
get angry with you.

29:45.905 --> 29:48.306
- It's my damn memory.
- I know. I know.

29:49.206 --> 29:50.471
I know.

29:50.473 --> 29:52.040
Come on, come on.

29:55.572 --> 29:57.339
I brought a surprise for you.

29:59.372 --> 30:01.003
You brought a surprise for me?

30:01.005 --> 30:04.069
There's something I
want us to do, okay?

30:04.071 --> 30:06.969
- Us together?
- Together. Tonight.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.106
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.171
I don't think I can.

30:12.305 --> 30:14.136
- What?
- You can do this.

30:14.138 --> 30:16.170
- Okay.
- I promise you.

30:16.172 --> 30:17.207
All right.

30:18.339 --> 30:20.471
So, what are you reading now?

30:20.473 --> 30:24.069
- Oh, you're reading Ernest Hemingway.
- I can't read anything, dear.

30:24.071 --> 30:26.772
Yeah, this is his
short stories, but...

30:28.006 --> 30:29.803
I can't, you know...

30:29.805 --> 30:31.869
- I start a sentence...
- Mmm-hmm.

30:31.871 --> 30:34.870
...and by the time I get
to the end of it...

30:34.872 --> 30:36.470
Mmm-hmm.

30:36.472 --> 30:38.106
- I can't...
- You can't remember how it started.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.869
Mmm-mmm.

30:40.871 --> 30:43.870
I can remember
things I remember,

30:43.872 --> 30:45.407
but I can't remember things I...

30:46.573 --> 30:47.805
Yeah.

30:51.406 --> 30:52.870
Oh, wow.

30:52.872 --> 30:55.073
Now, which one is
this? Do you know?

30:56.139 --> 30:58.307
- Jane.
- Yes.

31:07.072 --> 31:08.407
So sweet.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.371
Ah, now, where
are we in this one?

31:13.373 --> 31:15.470
Oh, Ella, look at you.

31:15.472 --> 31:19.171
I can't believe I'm married to
somebody as beautiful as you.

31:19.173 --> 31:21.173
- Oh.
- It's the Chowan River.

31:23.439 --> 31:26.107
Uh, now, who
are these people?

31:30.205 --> 31:34.070
Down in Charleston,
your nephews and nieces. Yeah.

31:34.072 --> 31:35.537
No.

31:35.539 --> 31:37.837
- They're your students.
- Yeah?

31:37.839 --> 31:40.336
They were throwing you
a birthday party. Look.

31:40.338 --> 31:42.036
Oh, wow. Yeah.

31:42.038 --> 31:43.870
- That was your favorite class.
- Yeah, that...

31:43.872 --> 31:45.004
Yeah.

31:45.006 --> 31:46.207
That's me, too.

31:48.839 --> 31:51.804
- Who's that?
- Now, that was Nantucket.

31:51.806 --> 31:54.040
And that was that nice boy
that Will met.

31:55.139 --> 31:57.005
They got on like
a house afire.

31:59.905 --> 32:01.905
Good pals. I wonder
what happened to him.

32:11.072 --> 32:12.107
Mmm.

32:29.138 --> 32:30.439
Oh.

32:32.839 --> 32:35.037
- Darling. Darling.
- Mmm?

32:35.039 --> 32:37.237
Wake up. Wake up.

32:37.239 --> 32:40.137
Come on. Get up.
Just for a minute. Get up.

32:42.172 --> 32:43.404
There you go.

32:43.406 --> 32:44.440
It happened again.

32:55.238 --> 32:57.836
Wait, wait. Let me
dry you off first.

32:57.838 --> 33:00.739
- Go ahead.
- Here. You're all wet.

33:02.038 --> 33:03.869
There.

33:03.871 --> 33:05.107
- Easy.
- There.

33:05.938 --> 33:08.069
Stupid briefs.

33:08.071 --> 33:11.869
Look, I bought you
six new pairs of boxers.

33:11.871 --> 33:13.538
- Why won't you wear them?
- I don't like 'em.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.237
- Why?
- I don't like them.

33:15.239 --> 33:18.304
Same old song I've
heard all my life.

33:18.306 --> 33:20.036
What's so great about briefs?

33:20.038 --> 33:21.439
Control.

33:22.406 --> 33:24.538
Six, seven... Whoops.

33:24.540 --> 33:27.804
Eight, nine, ten.

33:27.806 --> 33:31.170
And arms up and down.

33:31.172 --> 33:33.171
All the way up and breathe

33:33.173 --> 33:34.273
and down.

34:19.505 --> 34:21.803
You know what I
love about you, John?

34:21.804 --> 34:24.136
Your silences are
never embarrassing.

34:24.138 --> 34:26.504
Never once in my life
have I thought,

34:26.505 --> 34:28.871
"I really need to
say something now."

34:33.172 --> 34:35.170
So, you still see him?

34:35.172 --> 34:36.373
Mmm?

34:37.871 --> 34:39.835
What are you talking about?

34:39.838 --> 34:42.303
You speak with
him on the phone.

34:42.304 --> 34:44.303
You write him letters.

34:44.304 --> 34:46.803
- Who?
- Dan.

34:46.804 --> 34:49.070
You said he's living
in Daytona now.

34:49.072 --> 34:50.972
Dan?

34:51.938 --> 34:54.070
Not that again.

34:54.072 --> 34:58.171
Susan Sullivan told us
at Maggie Tate's funeral.

34:58.173 --> 35:00.271
You were standing there
right beside me.

35:00.273 --> 35:02.437
You asked about him.

35:02.439 --> 35:06.203
Uh, John, that was 10,
15 years ago.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.904
All these lies.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.073
All these years.

35:10.872 --> 35:14.237
"How poor a part
he, her husband..."

35:14.239 --> 35:16.370
- John. No, John.
- "...had played in her life."

35:16.372 --> 35:19.107
- Get back here.
- Gretta Conway.

35:20.439 --> 35:22.303
Can you believe this?

35:22.305 --> 35:25.870
He's convinced I'm still thinking
about my first boyfriend,

35:25.872 --> 35:28.371
who, by the way, dumped
me 50 years ago.

35:28.373 --> 35:30.970
Mind you, Dan
was right to do so,

35:30.972 --> 35:33.303
because it would never
have worked out between us.

35:33.305 --> 35:36.869
Times were different then.
I was only 19.

35:36.871 --> 35:39.271
Oh, that was
such a scandal.

35:39.273 --> 35:41.371
What happened?

35:41.373 --> 35:44.803
Well, they sent me to work at my
Aunt Rosemary's shop in Boston,

35:44.805 --> 35:46.339
and it was there
that I met John.

35:47.305 --> 35:49.469
He came into the shop,

35:49.471 --> 35:52.204
this handsome young teacher.

35:52.206 --> 35:55.036
He came in every week to buy
a pair of leather gloves.

35:55.038 --> 35:57.371
He always said he'd
lost the last pair.

35:57.373 --> 36:00.570
Eventually, I discovered he had
a whole house full of them.

36:03.471 --> 36:05.070
He was the one for me.

36:05.072 --> 36:07.503
And this first boyfriend?

36:07.505 --> 36:09.903
- You didn't think about him anymore?
- No.

36:09.905 --> 36:12.569
He vanished from my mind.

36:12.571 --> 36:16.536
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs

36:16.538 --> 36:18.303
"and blaming it on you..."

36:18.305 --> 36:20.470
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

36:20.472 --> 36:23.370
Mother. Where are you? For God's
sake, tell me where you are

36:23.372 --> 36:25.037
so we can come get
you immediately.

36:25.039 --> 36:26.569
<i>Now, listen, Will.</i>

36:26.571 --> 36:28.435
We were looking at family
slides last night,

36:28.437 --> 36:30.969
and we were looking at photos
from our trip to Nantucket.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.170
- Nantucket?
- Remember that?

36:33.172 --> 36:35.435
- It was so beautiful.
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>

36:35.437 --> 36:37.435
And you met that nice boy.
What was his name?

36:37.437 --> 36:39.204
- <i>Patrick.</i>
- Patrick?

36:39.206 --> 36:41.435
- Two of you were very close.
- <i>Now, listen to me, Mom.</i>

36:41.437 --> 36:44.003
Jane and I are seriously thinking about
filing a missing persons report.

36:44.005 --> 36:45.536
<i>Anyway, I was wondering,</i>

36:45.538 --> 36:48.170
- are you happy in your new work?
- <i>You're not listening.</i>

36:48.172 --> 36:49.537
You were such a
wonderful broker.

36:49.539 --> 36:52.236
You could sell some
truly ugly houses.

36:52.238 --> 36:54.402
Don't you change the subject.

36:54.404 --> 36:56.836
Was it because you had an argument
with your business partner Richard?

36:56.838 --> 36:58.836
You really need to come back
and resume your therapy.

36:58.838 --> 37:00.337
- The two of you were so close.
- <i>Mother.</i>

37:00.339 --> 37:02.170
- And I always wondered...
- <i>It's crucial, Mother.</i>

37:02.172 --> 37:04.237
- Were you in a...
- <i>How's Dad? Is he with you?</i>

37:04.239 --> 37:06.103
Oh, Will, come on.

37:06.105 --> 37:08.435
- Talk to me, please.
- <i>Is he taking his meds?</i>

37:08.437 --> 37:10.536
- Oh, God damn it!
- <i>Mom?</i>

37:10.538 --> 37:11.803
<i>Mother.</i>

37:11.805 --> 37:12.869
You're killing me.

37:12.871 --> 37:15.370
John. John!

37:15.372 --> 37:17.904
- Oh, God.
- Oh, snap.

37:17.906 --> 37:19.904
Grandpa forgot his wife.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.969
Oh, please, please,
help me, please.

37:21.971 --> 37:23.406
Hey, come on. Hop aboard.

37:24.338 --> 37:25.570
- Come on.
- On that?

37:25.572 --> 37:27.303
Yeah, it's a piece of cake.

37:27.305 --> 37:29.203
- How?
- All right.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.569
- Come on, help her out.
- All right, I'll help you up.

37:30.571 --> 37:31.970
- Here we go.
- Okay.

37:31.972 --> 37:33.336
Great.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.906
- Okay, go.
- All right. Here we go.

38:02.437 --> 38:04.271
John!

38:04.273 --> 38:06.969
- John.
- Ella.

38:06.971 --> 38:10.969
Ella. What the hell are you
doing on a motorcycle?

38:10.971 --> 38:12.906
They're dangerous,
for God's sakes.

38:14.071 --> 38:15.435
I don't believe you.

38:15.437 --> 38:17.837
On a motorcycle
without a helmet.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.969
- And who was that guy?
- Go to hell.

38:19.971 --> 38:22.305
Well, you'll be with me
in the handbasket, missus.

38:30.337 --> 38:31.836
How you doing, darling?

38:31.838 --> 38:35.003
- I mean it. Go to hell.
- What?

38:35.005 --> 38:36.302
You left me behind.

38:36.304 --> 38:38.370
- I did not.
- You left me alone.

38:38.372 --> 38:40.502
I mean, I don't know where
you thought you were going,

38:40.504 --> 38:42.070
you and your empty head.

38:42.072 --> 38:45.570
Me, going somewhere without you?

38:45.572 --> 38:47.040
You must be crazy.

38:57.571 --> 39:00.005
- Let me do it, dear.
- No. What...

39:00.972 --> 39:02.236
John.

39:02.238 --> 39:03.505
That's dangerous.

39:18.071 --> 39:19.972
Put your hands
back on the wheel.

39:25.838 --> 39:29.070
John, you need to pull over.

39:29.072 --> 39:31.870
- Why? You need to pee?
- The police are right behind us.

39:31.872 --> 39:34.107
Now, let me do
the talking, okay?

39:35.173 --> 39:36.470
I need to find out if that

39:36.472 --> 39:38.205
fool son of ours
has snitched on us.

39:40.539 --> 39:42.072
You just keep quiet.

39:48.237 --> 39:49.372
Here he comes.

39:56.271 --> 39:57.936
License and
registration, please.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.238
Yes, Officer. Of course. Here.

40:09.305 --> 40:10.773
I'm John Spencer.

40:15.504 --> 40:17.969
Mr. Spencer, I pulled
you over 'cause I saw you

40:17.971 --> 40:19.503
weaving in and out
of lanes back there.

40:19.505 --> 40:21.903
Yes, Officer, it was
completely my fault.

40:21.905 --> 40:23.069
I was trying to
open this bottle of...

40:23.071 --> 40:24.837
Ma'am?

40:24.839 --> 40:26.436
I'd prefer Mr. Spencer
to answer for himself, please.

40:26.438 --> 40:29.303
Yes, Officer,
I was just trying

40:29.305 --> 40:33.003
to help her open the thing.

40:33.005 --> 40:34.139
"The thing"?

40:35.272 --> 40:36.439
Yeah, the thing.

40:38.805 --> 40:40.106
The, the, the bottle.

40:48.938 --> 40:50.369
I'm gonna go run your license.

40:50.371 --> 40:51.439
Stay put.

40:53.806 --> 40:56.203
What are you, insane?

40:56.205 --> 40:58.502
Don't even think about it.

40:58.504 --> 41:00.303
Give me the keys.

41:00.305 --> 41:02.869
Shh. Zip it.
He's coming back.

41:02.871 --> 41:06.371
Just be polite. Do
not burp or fart.

41:08.039 --> 41:09.969
Don't call him the fuzz.

41:09.971 --> 41:13.170
What's going on, old-timer?
Thinking about running on me?

41:13.172 --> 41:15.936
You two want to end up on "The
World's Slowest Police Chases"?

41:15.938 --> 41:18.839
That's a
good one, Officer.

41:19.905 --> 41:21.336
Stay in your lane.

41:21.338 --> 41:24.037
- Respect the speed limits, okay?
- Thank you.

41:24.039 --> 41:26.469
Absolutely, Officer.
Thank you so much.

41:26.471 --> 41:27.905
- Have a good day.
- Ma'am.

41:29.105 --> 41:30.869
Give me the key.

41:30.871 --> 41:32.405
Damn fool policeman.

41:34.437 --> 41:36.772
"World's Slowest
Police Chase."

41:38.504 --> 41:41.072
Who's he think I am?
O.J. Simpson?

41:45.305 --> 41:48.206
Our old trips were never
this adventurous, were they?

41:50.805 --> 41:52.470
Traveling's important.

41:52.472 --> 41:54.502
Broadening your horizons.

41:54.504 --> 41:56.005
Broadens your mind.

That's the littlest
one. The boy.

42:42.806 --> 42:46.171
He's got a name,
John, and it's Will.

42:47.806 --> 42:49.506
- Well, yeah. William.
- William.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.536
Is that you?

42:54.538 --> 42:56.904
I was pregnant then with Will.

42:56.906 --> 43:01.069
Now, tell... Who's that woman
standing there next to me?

43:01.071 --> 43:02.570
What is her name?

43:02.572 --> 43:05.270
- She lived next door to us.
- That's right.

43:05.272 --> 43:06.903
It's our neighbor.

43:06.905 --> 43:08.570
- Lillian.
- Lillian.

43:08.572 --> 43:10.903
Very good.

43:10.905 --> 43:12.537
- Fantastic.
- Ma'am.

43:12.539 --> 43:14.803
Would it bother you
if we watched as well?

43:14.805 --> 43:17.336
Oh, sure, sure.
Come on in, guys.

43:17.338 --> 43:18.940
Make yourselves comfortable.

43:19.872 --> 43:21.270
Oh, thank you very much.

43:21.272 --> 43:23.968
- Yes, ma'am.
- Here, John. Beer.

43:23.970 --> 43:25.335
From the boys.

43:25.337 --> 43:26.903
Why, thank you.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.505
- Here we go.
- All right.

43:30.338 --> 43:31.840
Wow.

43:33.037 --> 43:34.803
That's my daughter.

43:34.805 --> 43:37.068
Well, she's beautiful, sir.

43:40.471 --> 43:42.470
- Oh.
- Oh.

43:46.472 --> 43:48.372
And that's John's
birthday party.

43:49.871 --> 43:51.038
John?

44:06.405 --> 44:09.103
Those are his students.

44:09.105 --> 44:11.036
They're always
around the house.

44:11.038 --> 44:13.438
They would even come back
after they've graduated.

44:25.438 --> 44:26.740
Excuse me.

44:27.538 --> 44:29.269
Hi.

44:29.271 --> 44:30.406
Where's Ella?

44:32.238 --> 44:33.372
I'm here, John.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.902
No.

44:35.904 --> 44:37.537
No, Ella Carson.

44:37.539 --> 44:40.003
She's my girl. She's 22.

44:40.005 --> 44:41.839
Long blonde hair.
She's gorgeous.

45:26.971 --> 45:29.971
- Is that really you, Ella?
- Of course it's me.

45:35.272 --> 45:36.506
Who are you?

45:37.538 --> 45:40.102
I'm me. John.

45:40.104 --> 45:41.435
No, you're not.

45:41.437 --> 45:43.405
My John is a young teacher.

45:45.070 --> 45:46.402
He's charming.

45:46.404 --> 45:48.905
Very handsome. Educated.

45:50.471 --> 45:51.938
I want him back.

45:54.505 --> 45:57.239
You stole him from me, and I
want you to give him back.

45:59.372 --> 46:03.335
Oh, boy. If I could, I would.

46:03.337 --> 46:06.472
Whoever stole him from you
stole him from me, too.

46:50.870 --> 46:52.205
John?

47:18.305 --> 47:19.339
One second.

47:20.171 --> 47:22.102
Um, excuse me.

47:22.104 --> 47:24.236
You haven't, by any chance,
seen my husband?

47:24.238 --> 47:26.803
He's a tall,
distinguished-looking gentleman

47:26.805 --> 47:28.868
with white hair and glasses.

47:28.870 --> 47:32.336
Uh, yeah, guy like that passed
by here about a half hour ago.

47:32.338 --> 47:34.506
He did? Where
was he going?

47:35.437 --> 47:36.935
No idea, ma'am.

47:36.937 --> 47:38.869
Then I'm afraid
I'm gonna need your help.

47:38.871 --> 47:41.269
You see, my husband suffers
from memory loss,

47:41.271 --> 47:44.236
and I'm afraid he might just
wander off and get hurt.

47:44.238 --> 47:46.235
- I can't leave my post.
- Oh, my...

47:46.237 --> 47:47.869
- What about your RV?
- No. I...

47:47.871 --> 47:50.103
I can't handle
that. That's too big.

47:50.105 --> 47:51.903
I... Oh, please.

47:51.905 --> 47:53.903
I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't so important.

47:53.905 --> 47:55.469
Please.

47:55.471 --> 47:57.004
Let me call my brother Terry.

47:57.937 --> 47:59.172
It's my fault.

48:00.272 --> 48:01.439
Gosh.

48:05.137 --> 48:07.502
Hey. Hey, is that him?

48:07.504 --> 48:09.502
That poor old fella?

48:09.504 --> 48:12.369
No, I told you, my John is a
distinguished-looking gentleman.

48:12.371 --> 48:16.470
He's got white hair, glasses
and a well-groomed beard.

48:16.472 --> 48:19.402
I get it. Academic
from Yankee-land.

48:19.404 --> 48:20.738
I like that type.

48:21.505 --> 48:23.470
There he is. There he is!

48:23.472 --> 48:24.569
That's him.

48:24.571 --> 48:28.003
John! John!

48:28.005 --> 48:29.473
Oh, thank God.

48:30.870 --> 48:32.138
John!

48:35.970 --> 48:38.370
John.

48:38.372 --> 48:39.971
Oh, John.

48:41.472 --> 48:44.272
- John.
- Why are you crying?

48:45.572 --> 48:47.370
Because you weren't there,

48:47.372 --> 48:49.836
and I wouldn't know
how to live without you.

48:49.838 --> 48:51.839
Not for one minute.

48:56.037 --> 48:58.071
Listen. Listen.

49:00.437 --> 49:03.003
We must not be
separated, okay?

49:03.005 --> 49:04.402
Do you understand?

49:04.404 --> 49:07.136
Because we don't
have much time left.

49:07.138 --> 49:09.903
Well, then it's a
good thing you came,

49:09.905 --> 49:12.370
'cause you wouldn't
have wanted to miss this.

49:12.372 --> 49:14.470
This is an extraordinary...

49:14.472 --> 49:16.804
It's one hell of a
chocolate ice cream.

49:22.304 --> 49:24.203
Can I get you an
ice cream, ma'am?

49:24.205 --> 49:25.370
Yes, thank you.

49:25.372 --> 49:27.272
No, no, get me a whiskey.

49:46.471 --> 49:49.170
It was so cold, but
it was beautiful.

49:49.172 --> 49:52.902
Everything was covered in
with a layer of ice.

49:52.904 --> 49:55.402
It was all shiny
and transparent,

49:55.404 --> 49:59.102
as if the whole world
was covered by glass.

49:59.104 --> 50:01.869
I had to take little,
little teensy steps

50:01.871 --> 50:04.269
to stop from slipping.

50:04.271 --> 50:07.536
And I was very cold,
but you wanted to go on.

50:07.538 --> 50:11.369
Because you were telling me
the story of <i>White Fang.</i>

50:11.371 --> 50:13.335
And you were keeping
your voice low

50:13.337 --> 50:17.336
so as not to disturb
the beautiful silence.

50:17.338 --> 50:21.236
And we got home at
3:00 in the morning,

50:21.238 --> 50:23.272
and our hair was
covered in frost.

50:25.238 --> 50:27.402
And that was the
night we made Jane.

50:27.404 --> 50:28.904
Jane.

50:30.438 --> 50:31.473
What is it?

50:42.172 --> 50:44.068
Mile marker 21.

50:44.070 --> 50:45.335
Thank you.

50:45.337 --> 50:46.868
It's okay, hon.
AAA will be here

50:46.870 --> 50:48.403
- in about a half an hour.
- I can do it.

50:48.405 --> 50:50.435
I don't need them.

50:50.437 --> 50:53.369
I know you don't, but I don't
want you out here in the sun.

50:53.371 --> 50:55.105
Come on. We're on vacation.

51:03.305 --> 51:06.269
- You folks need a hand?
- Yeah, need anything?

51:06.271 --> 51:08.102
No, we're fine, we're fine.

51:08.104 --> 51:10.969
The AAA will be
here in just a minute.

51:10.971 --> 51:12.370
How long you think it'll be
till they get here?

51:12.372 --> 51:14.002
Oh, them?

51:14.004 --> 51:15.868
A half hour if we're lucky.

51:15.870 --> 51:18.004
- Well, good.
- That's what you said.

51:20.038 --> 51:22.436
Look. All right,
just be cool.

51:22.438 --> 51:25.501
We're gonna take all your
stuff, and then we'll go. Okay?

51:25.503 --> 51:26.971
Give me the phone, lady.

51:29.038 --> 51:30.802
That's a nice-ass
ring you got.

51:30.804 --> 51:32.002
- Oh.
- Give it to me.

51:32.004 --> 51:33.302
- No.
- Hey.

51:33.304 --> 51:34.370
Not my ring. It's
my wedding ring.

51:34.372 --> 51:35.835
Lady.

51:35.837 --> 51:37.169
Where's your wallet at?

51:37.171 --> 51:39.202
Never end a sentence
with a preposition.

51:39.204 --> 51:41.501
The "at" is implied
when you say "where."

51:41.503 --> 51:44.235
Oh!

51:44.237 --> 51:47.402
There's no need to get upset just
because you don't know grammar.

51:47.404 --> 51:50.469
- You can learn it.
- John, just do what they say.

51:50.471 --> 51:53.068
Old lady, you shut your ass
up. Give me your purse.

51:53.070 --> 51:55.105
It's in the camper.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.835
Shall I get it?

51:57.837 --> 51:59.205
Yeah. Hurry up.

52:01.871 --> 52:03.836
It's huge. Win the
lottery or something?

52:03.838 --> 52:06.003
It's got a picture
of my family in it,

52:06.005 --> 52:08.835
and I would appreciate it
if you would not take that.

52:08.837 --> 52:10.403
Just like eight bucks in here.

52:10.405 --> 52:12.169
That's all she gives me.

52:12.171 --> 52:13.838
Does she keep your balls, too? Good...

52:16.105 --> 52:18.569
- Shit.
- Oh, shit.

52:18.571 --> 52:21.468
Hey! Put down the gun,
or I hurt him bad.

52:21.470 --> 52:23.936
If you hurt him,
I'll shoot you both,

52:23.938 --> 52:26.135
and if you think we're afraid,
you're very wrong,

52:26.137 --> 52:28.236
because we've got
nothing to lose.

52:28.238 --> 52:30.370
So drop the knives,
you hooligans.

52:32.238 --> 52:34.369
- Is that Will?
- Yes, ma'am.

52:34.371 --> 52:36.502
He's always calling
at the wrong time.

52:36.504 --> 52:40.235
I don't want to speak to him.
Just throw it on the ground.

52:40.237 --> 52:43.370
Make sure the safety's off before you
start shooting them, sweetheart.

52:43.372 --> 52:45.069
Already done it, hon.

52:45.071 --> 52:47.172
Put the rings on the wallet.

52:48.905 --> 52:51.003
Now, you get
along out of here.

52:51.005 --> 52:53.902
I won't even call the cops
if you hurry up. Go on.

52:53.904 --> 52:56.302
Your rings sucked
anyway, you old bag!

52:56.304 --> 52:58.302
And your wallet's
full of bullshit.

52:58.304 --> 53:00.868
You fellas should
consider evening classes.

53:00.870 --> 53:02.269
Turn your life around.

53:02.271 --> 53:05.968
- It's not too late.
- Hey, screw you, Pop!

53:05.970 --> 53:09.068
Lucky we had the gun.
I thought we left it at home.

53:09.070 --> 53:11.102
I thought we might need it.

53:11.104 --> 53:15.068
Hon, would you get me
a Canadian from the fridge?

53:15.070 --> 53:16.338
Yes, ma'am.

53:17.272 --> 53:19.005
One Canadian coming up.

53:45.070 --> 53:46.903
I'm sorry I couldn't
speak with Will.

53:46.905 --> 53:48.501
I was held up.

53:48.503 --> 53:50.270
<i>We're really worried, Mother.</i>

53:50.272 --> 53:52.803
Will is getting desperate.
I'm going to see him now.

53:52.805 --> 53:54.235
Oh, your brother's
a nervous nelly.

53:54.237 --> 53:56.902
Your daddy and I are having
a fine old time.

53:56.904 --> 53:59.802
- Where are you, Mom?
- Jane, you would not believe

53:59.804 --> 54:03.069
how beautiful
it is right here.

54:03.071 --> 54:05.935
You're not gonna tell
me. Okay, I get it.

54:05.937 --> 54:08.270
- How's Dad?
- He's fine. He's full of beans.

54:08.272 --> 54:09.868
You want to speak with him?

54:09.870 --> 54:12.468
Hey, it's Jane.
She wants to speak with you.

54:12.470 --> 54:14.472
- Who is it?
- It's your daughter. Take it.

54:16.204 --> 54:17.369
Hi, pumpkin.

54:17.371 --> 54:19.170
<i>How are you?</i>

54:19.172 --> 54:21.836
You haven't called me that
since I was eight, Daddy.

54:21.838 --> 54:26.236
You've been so much in my head
these days, little one.

54:26.238 --> 54:32.468
Do you have any idea
how proud I am of you?

54:32.470 --> 54:38.068
<i>I bet you're making quite a
splash at that college of yours.</i>

54:38.070 --> 54:42.335
<i>I mean, it's not for
nothing your name's Spencer.</i>

54:42.337 --> 54:44.802
Yes, Daddy.

54:44.804 --> 54:48.071
Well, I love you, pumpkin.
We'll see you soon.

54:50.004 --> 54:52.138
Jane. "Jane"?

54:54.005 --> 54:55.038
Jane.

54:56.437 --> 54:57.872
Mom.

54:59.303 --> 55:01.172
I love you, too, darling.

55:02.037 --> 55:03.803
<i>Me too, Mom.</i>

55:03.805 --> 55:05.371
You make sure you
come home, okay?

55:07.204 --> 55:09.302
Okay, darling.

55:09.304 --> 55:11.371
Listen, kiss the kids
for me, will you?

55:13.004 --> 55:15.269
And tell your brother
that we've spoken.

55:15.271 --> 55:17.772
- Okay?
- <i>I will...</i>

55:19.138 --> 55:20.772
- <i>I will, Mom.</i>
- Okay.

55:22.138 --> 55:24.239
- Bye.
- <i>Okay.</i>

55:39.437 --> 55:42.172
Hey, don't finish
all the Canadian.

55:44.537 --> 55:46.036
Thank you.

55:46.038 --> 55:47.435
A large one.

55:47.437 --> 55:48.472
Perfect.

55:51.205 --> 55:55.203
Leave them alone.
They're having fun.

55:55.205 --> 55:59.036
Allow me to introduce Jane,
the all-knowing.

55:59.038 --> 56:04.069
Watch her explain how it is to poor
Will because he doesn't know jack shit.

56:04.071 --> 56:06.103
What the hell are
you talking about?

56:06.105 --> 56:08.368
I'm just saying that there's
nothing we can do to stop them.

56:08.370 --> 56:10.135
It's her right to
refuse treatment.

56:10.137 --> 56:14.003
We both know how little
good it does anyway.

56:14.005 --> 56:17.368
I know that it's better than
wandering around God-knows-where

56:17.370 --> 56:19.038
in a creaky camper.

56:21.005 --> 56:24.903
But you know best, I guess,
because you talked to Dad.

56:24.905 --> 56:27.135
And you two are
thick as thieves.

56:27.137 --> 56:29.035
Even when he doesn't
remember who you are.

56:29.037 --> 56:32.835
I don't know why you are
making this so personal, Will.

56:32.837 --> 56:37.935
Because you live two hours
away and phone once a week?

56:37.937 --> 56:40.501
And come on weekends for
lunches that are cooked by me.

56:40.503 --> 56:42.434
What do you know about...

56:42.436 --> 56:45.235
What do you know about spending
long afternoons with Dad

56:45.237 --> 56:49.035
when he doesn't say a single
thing that makes any sense?

56:49.037 --> 56:51.369
Do you know what Mom says
when she gets sick,

56:51.371 --> 56:53.836
and I have to run there
in the middle of the night?

56:53.838 --> 56:55.103
Do you know what she says?

56:55.105 --> 56:57.935
"Don't call Jane. She's busy."

56:57.937 --> 57:01.502
You've been telling this story about how
I'm the favorite child for years, Will.

57:01.504 --> 57:03.302
- It's bullshit.
- Maybe it is.

57:03.304 --> 57:05.936
But it's the only
story I've got.

57:05.938 --> 57:08.401
They're just doing what they've
done their whole lives.

57:08.403 --> 57:11.002
Staying together,
the two of them.

57:11.004 --> 57:14.839
There's so much love between
them, they forgot about us.

57:16.237 --> 57:18.135
- Both of us.
- Oh, Will.

57:18.137 --> 57:19.404
Get off.

57:21.136 --> 57:22.501
You know what happened?

57:22.503 --> 57:24.270
When was it? Last year.

57:26.937 --> 57:28.402
I opened their bedroom door,

57:28.404 --> 57:30.569
and you won't believe
what they were doing.

57:30.571 --> 57:34.102
She was on the bed,
and he was,

57:34.104 --> 57:35.836
he was kneeling
in front of her.

57:35.838 --> 57:37.435
I can't even say it.

57:37.437 --> 57:40.036
Dad was muff diving?

57:40.038 --> 57:41.569
Yodeling in the canyon?

57:41.571 --> 57:43.235
"Yodeling..."

57:43.237 --> 57:46.301
- I wanted to vomit.
- Why?

57:46.303 --> 57:48.402
I hope it happens to me
when I'm their age.

57:48.404 --> 57:50.569
God, what a thought.

57:50.571 --> 57:52.435
But I kind of doubt it.

57:52.437 --> 57:54.134
For years with
Phillip and me,

57:54.136 --> 57:57.137
it's been one quick
kiss and, "Good night."

58:05.337 --> 58:08.569
Houston, we have a problem.

58:08.571 --> 58:10.301
Well, just pull over.

58:10.303 --> 58:11.535
We can wait.

59:15.136 --> 59:17.335

- Yeah.

59:17.337 --> 59:19.469

You voted Democrat
your whole life.

59:30.237 --> 59:34.101
I mean, you volunteered
for Walter Mondale.

59:34.103 --> 59:35.803
Don't you remember?

59:35.805 --> 59:37.835
I mean, how mad you got

59:37.837 --> 59:40.102
when I said I was
gonna vote for Reagan?

59:40.104 --> 59:41.338
Reagan?

59:42.970 --> 59:44.835
Oh, you don't remember
who he is, do you?

59:44.837 --> 59:46.839
- Yes, I do.
- No, no, that's not true.

59:48.036 --> 59:49.935
You haven't the
slightest idea.

59:49.937 --> 59:51.037
Who am I?

59:52.371 --> 59:53.872
What's my name?

59:55.404 --> 59:59.101
Oh, come on, John.
You know my name really well.

59:59.103 --> 01:00:00.169
What is it?

01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:02.402
It starts with "El."

01:00:02.404 --> 01:00:03.468
Lillian.

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.903
Oh, sweet Jesus.

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:08.235
Lillian is the next
door neighbor.

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.739
I'm your wife.

01:00:10.404 --> 01:00:12.068

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.001

01:00:14.003 --> 01:00:16.001
I... Oh, God.

01:00:16.003 --> 01:00:17.302
Ella, my darling Ella.

01:00:17.304 --> 01:00:19.869
It's just my
stupid, empty head.

01:00:19.871 --> 01:00:21.501

Oh, darling.

01:00:50.937 --> 01:00:53.101

01:00:53.103 --> 01:00:55.835
- Really?
- Don't you remember?

01:00:55.837 --> 01:00:59.202
We went to visit him
in that human warehouse.

01:00:59.204 --> 01:01:00.772
He didn't recognize us.

01:01:01.969 --> 01:01:03.137
Oh...

01:01:03.969 --> 01:01:05.405
Well...

01:01:07.336 --> 01:01:09.871
That's terrible.

01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:13.405
Poor Jim.

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:22.802
- Promise me something.
- Mmm? What?

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.970
You love me. Promise me

01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:29.301
that when the
time comes with me

01:01:29.303 --> 01:01:32.468
to put me in
one of those places...

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:35.134
And it's gonna be sooner than
later. You know that.

01:01:35.136 --> 01:01:39.369
No, I'm getting worse
and worse every day.

01:01:39.371 --> 01:01:42.435
Promise me that you'll put
the shotgun in my hand...

01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:44.134
Shh. No, don't.

01:01:44.136 --> 01:01:45.471
Listen to me, sweetheart.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.234
Put the shotgun in my hand,

01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:52.738
put my thumb in the trigger,

01:01:54.303 --> 01:01:57.968
and then explain to me
so that I understand

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:00.839
that this is exactly
what I want to do,

01:02:01.937 --> 01:02:04.170
I told you to
do it. Tell me.

01:02:05.303 --> 01:02:06.337
Okay?

01:02:07.303 --> 01:02:08.337
And kiss me.

01:02:09.936 --> 01:02:11.270
Kiss me, kiss me twice,

01:02:13.237 --> 01:02:14.504
and then walk away.

01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:18.938
It's like mud season
in Massachusetts.

01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:22.804
Messy but necessary.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.302
Just don't do it
in the living room, okay?

01:02:40.337 --> 01:02:43.202
Oh, gosh. Damn it. God...

01:02:43.204 --> 01:02:44.835
Mmm.

01:02:44.837 --> 01:02:46.938
What have you done?
Put it back in.

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:53.337
I can't find the plug.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:55.971
What's that?

01:02:56.404 --> 01:02:58.002
What?

01:02:58.004 --> 01:03:00.502
I heard a noise. What is that?

01:03:00.504 --> 01:03:03.035
Well, it's unlikely
it's an alligator.

01:03:03.037 --> 01:03:05.502
- An alligator?
- Let's get the gun.

01:03:05.504 --> 01:03:08.138
No, no, no. Let's
just go inside.

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:10.771
Oh, shit!

01:03:11.404 --> 01:03:12.835
Ella!

01:03:12.837 --> 01:03:14.802
I think I hurt my back.

01:03:14.804 --> 01:03:16.105
Oh, John!

01:03:16.804 --> 01:03:18.134
John!

01:03:18.136 --> 01:03:19.867
You'll have to get over here

01:03:19.869 --> 01:03:21.835
- to help me get up.
- Give me your shoulders.

01:03:21.837 --> 01:03:23.535
"Give me your shoulders"?
What do you mean?

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:25.968
- Get...
- Oh, God!

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.901
- God.
- Get off me!

01:03:27.903 --> 01:03:30.502
- You're crushing me.
- I think I hurt my arm.

01:03:30.504 --> 01:03:32.834
So what? Just get off.

01:03:32.836 --> 01:03:35.835
Get off me. Get off me.

01:03:39.969 --> 01:03:41.435
Are you all right?

01:03:41.437 --> 01:03:43.404
What are we
doing on the ground?

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:45.934
You don't remember?

01:03:45.936 --> 01:03:48.401
I fell down, and
you fell on top of me.

01:03:48.403 --> 01:03:49.738
Oh, shit.

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:53.003
Ow!

01:04:09.003 --> 01:04:12.201
John, I can't do it.

01:04:12.203 --> 01:04:14.867
Uh, get up, get over
here, and help me.

01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:20.338
John?

01:04:22.969 --> 01:04:24.271
Oh, I can't believe it.

01:04:26.271 --> 01:04:27.405
John!

01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:38.801
John!

01:04:40.036 --> 01:04:41.802
Hey, are you crazy?

01:04:41.804 --> 01:04:44.204
What are you trying to do?
Stone me to death?

01:04:48.204 --> 01:04:51.204
- What are you doing?
- Well, your shoes have come off.

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:55.867
There.

01:04:55.869 --> 01:04:58.501
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.438
After all you've
done for me,

01:05:02.003 --> 01:05:03.237
this is nothing.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:07.937
Look at you. You're all dirty.

01:05:17.537 --> 01:05:19.370
John, what's the big rush?

01:05:21.303 --> 01:05:23.803
Oh, I could have done
with a little more sleep.

01:05:26.936 --> 01:05:28.268
Oh, my God.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:31.001
It's the moment
of truth, Ella.

01:05:31.003 --> 01:05:32.901
For heaven's
sake, what's this?

01:05:32.903 --> 01:05:35.002
Take me to him. Now.

01:05:35.004 --> 01:05:37.337
- To who?
- "To whom"!

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:39.402
To Dan.

01:05:39.404 --> 01:05:41.834
To Daniel Coleman.

01:05:41.836 --> 01:05:44.169
I need to look him
straight in the eye.

01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:46.802
Oh, for God's sake.

01:05:46.804 --> 01:05:49.001
I'm not going to wait
for some snowy night

01:05:49.003 --> 01:05:52.034
for you to finally confess everything
as you look out the window at

01:05:52.036 --> 01:05:54.568
"the snow falling faintly
through the universe."

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:58.135
I am so sick and
tired of this nonsense.

01:05:58.137 --> 01:06:00.302
He was always
there for you, Dan.

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.135
I've only ever
been second best.

01:06:02.137 --> 01:06:04.535
How dare you
point a gun at me?

01:06:04.537 --> 01:06:06.171
Take me to him.

01:06:07.837 --> 01:06:09.835
You want to see Dan?

01:06:09.837 --> 01:06:11.505
Fine. Fine.

01:06:12.437 --> 01:06:14.034
What are you doing?

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.135
I'm going to find out
where Dan Coleman is,

01:06:16.137 --> 01:06:19.105
even if he's in his grave,
and I'm gonna take you to him.

01:06:19.804 --> 01:06:21.002
You will?

01:06:21.004 --> 01:06:22.804
- Sullivan. Sullivan.
- Really?

01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:28.536
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Susan?</i>

01:06:28.538 --> 01:06:30.002
<i>It's me. Who's speaking?</i>

01:06:30.004 --> 01:06:31.370
You'll never guess
who this is.

01:06:53.136 --> 01:06:55.002
You can't go in
there with a gun.

01:06:55.004 --> 01:06:57.802
I'm going in as I see fit.

01:06:57.804 --> 01:06:59.901
Fine. Fine.

01:06:59.903 --> 01:07:03.235
A hundred cops will probably show
up and kill us both, but fine.

01:07:03.237 --> 01:07:05.305
If that's what you want,
that's what you'll get.

01:07:12.903 --> 01:07:14.369
May I help you?

01:07:14.371 --> 01:07:17.134
Yes, we'd like to see
Daniel Coleman, please.

01:07:17.136 --> 01:07:20.068
- Daniel Coleman?
- I believe he's a resident here.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.568
- Are you on the list?
- We're just old friends.

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:24.967
We're just passing by.

01:07:24.969 --> 01:07:27.903
- Wait one moment.
- You're very kind.

01:07:31.037 --> 01:07:32.405
John, she said to wait.

01:07:40.137 --> 01:07:42.967
- Is that you, Coleman?
- Who?

01:07:42.969 --> 01:07:44.268
Daniel Coleman.

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.369
Who?

01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:47.035
I'm so sorry.

01:07:47.037 --> 01:07:48.335
I think we've got
the wrong room.

01:07:48.337 --> 01:07:50.034
We're so sorry to disturb you.

01:07:50.036 --> 01:07:51.902
Daniel Coleman. You know him?

01:07:51.904 --> 01:07:53.471
- Which room is his?
- Who?

01:07:56.271 --> 01:08:00.102
Finally, we find you.

01:08:00.104 --> 01:08:04.002
I've always wanted to see
your face, Dan Coleman.

01:08:04.004 --> 01:08:05.235
It's all right.

01:08:05.237 --> 01:08:06.867
It's all right.
It's not loaded.

01:08:06.869 --> 01:08:08.568
- It isn't?
- But...

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.901
I'm not Dan.

01:08:10.903 --> 01:08:12.370
Where's Daniel Coleman?

01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:17.371
Hello, Dan.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:21.002
That's him?

01:08:21.004 --> 01:08:23.335
It's me.

01:08:23.337 --> 01:08:25.435
- Me?
- It's Ella.

01:08:25.437 --> 01:08:26.470
Ella Carson.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.533
I don't know you.

01:08:29.536 --> 01:08:32.136
Two strange white folks
walk into my room...

01:08:34.004 --> 01:08:36.901
This is my husband,
John Spencer.

01:08:36.903 --> 01:08:39.402
- Nice to meet you.
- I don't care.

01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:41.001
John Spencer.

01:08:41.002 --> 01:08:42.801
It don't make no
difference who he is.

01:08:42.803 --> 01:08:44.234
Just get out of here.

01:08:44.236 --> 01:08:46.801
- Do you wear boxers?
- What?

01:08:46.804 --> 01:08:48.902
Do you wear boxers or briefs?

01:08:48.904 --> 01:08:50.567
And this is what
you want to know?

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:53.001
I want to understand
where this fixation

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:55.035
with boxers comes from.

01:08:55.037 --> 01:08:56.801
Fine. Fine.

01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:58.901
Ask away.

01:08:58.903 --> 01:09:01.466
Do you wear boxers or briefs?

01:09:01.469 --> 01:09:03.402
I wear diapers, white boy.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:04.901
Now, get on out of here.

01:09:04.903 --> 01:09:06.002
Ella what?

01:09:06.004 --> 01:09:08.001
You really don't remember me.

01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:10.934
I don't want to remember
you. I don't know you.

01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:12.468
Get the hell out
this goddamn place.

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.167
Shoot this son
of a bitch, John.

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:16.468
- But it's not loaded.
- Oh, my God, a gun.

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.134
- Guys?
- What are you doing?

01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:19.568
- He doesn't remember my wife.
- Is everybody okay?

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.268
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.401
- It's not loaded.
- Guys, let's go.

01:09:22.403 --> 01:09:23.867
You gotta go.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.468
- He's an English teacher.
- Guys.

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:27.269
- He's not dangerous.
- Let's go. It's fine.

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:29.001
- Sir, you're gonna have to go.
- It's okay.

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:31.102
You're gonna have to go.

01:09:31.104 --> 01:09:33.135
Just be grateful
we didn't call the police.

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:35.001
Oh, we are. We're
very grateful.

01:09:35.002 --> 01:09:37.434
Thank you so much. You've
been very understanding.

01:09:37.435 --> 01:09:40.334
We were thinking that perhaps the two
of you might need a little rest.

01:09:40.336 --> 01:09:42.100
No offense intended.

01:09:42.103 --> 01:09:44.268
This contains a list of all
the insurance we accept.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:47.468
We'll call your children, so
they can come tour the facility.

01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:49.533
Thank you. That's very
kind of you.

01:09:49.536 --> 01:09:50.966
And the next time that you guys
want to come visit your friend,

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.401
do it without the gun, okay?

01:09:52.403 --> 01:09:54.501
- Even if it is empty.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

01:09:54.503 --> 01:09:55.902
Thank you so much.

01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:57.334
- Goodbye.
- But are you sure

01:09:57.336 --> 01:09:58.801
you want to be
traveling around on your own?

01:09:58.803 --> 01:10:00.202
- It's nice here.
- We're fine.

01:10:00.204 --> 01:10:01.238
Ask Dan.

01:10:16.536 --> 01:10:17.803
Why are you so sad?

01:10:20.402 --> 01:10:22.038
I'm just a little tired.

01:10:25.203 --> 01:10:26.904
I'm also angry.

01:10:28.569 --> 01:10:30.271
At you mostly.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:33.070
But also at Dan.

01:10:36.003 --> 01:10:38.568
Dan? Dan who?

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:40.401
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:47.101
I know who Dan
is. I was joking.

01:10:47.103 --> 01:10:50.504
Dan is the fella who isn't
in Savannah anymore.

01:10:54.303 --> 01:10:56.870
He was black.
I mean, he is black.

01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:01.534
He was a little more
charismatic at the time.

01:11:01.536 --> 01:11:03.403
Wow.

01:11:04.502 --> 01:11:06.237
Wow, wow, wow.

01:11:07.336 --> 01:11:08.437
My Ella.

01:11:11.137 --> 01:11:15.205
John, can we sleep
in a real bed tonight?

01:11:32.036 --> 01:11:34.401
Now, once we get to the
event, there will be security there,

01:11:34.403 --> 01:11:36.501
so in addition to your ticket,

01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:39.035
everyone take a moment, make sure
you've got a photo ID with you.

01:11:39.037 --> 01:11:40.802
We're still missing
a couple people,

01:11:40.804 --> 01:11:42.401
so we're just gonna group up
in the lobby right here.

01:11:42.403 --> 01:11:43.804
If you just want
to gather round...

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:49.868
- Hi.
- Good evening, ma'am.

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.367
- Good evening.
- How might I assist you?

01:11:51.369 --> 01:11:53.301
Do you have a room available?

01:11:53.303 --> 01:11:55.501
Economical. It's just
for one night.

01:11:55.503 --> 01:11:57.468
We have a standard double
with twin beds.

01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:59.301
No, no, no, we
can't be separated.

01:11:59.303 --> 01:12:00.968
No.

01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:03.501
Well, in that case,
we have the Lawrenceville,

01:12:03.503 --> 01:12:05.068
a beautiful suite
with a king bed.

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.134
Oh, we'll take it. Thank you.

01:12:07.136 --> 01:12:09.401
That normally goes
for $500 a night,

01:12:09.403 --> 01:12:12.101
but I can let you have it
for $320 plus tax.

01:12:12.103 --> 01:12:13.835
Goodness me, I don't
want to buy it.

01:12:13.837 --> 01:12:15.337
I just want to spend
the night in it.

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:21.400
I've never spent that much on a
hotel room in my whole life.

01:12:21.402 --> 01:12:24.035
The Lawrenceville it is.
Guillermo will show you.

01:12:24.037 --> 01:12:26.135
Do you have any luggage?

01:12:26.137 --> 01:12:28.300
There's the minibar,

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:32.171
some complimentary items, stereo,
and in here is the master bedroom.

01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:36.233
This is bigger
than our house.

01:12:36.235 --> 01:12:39.234
- Can we afford it?
- Don't be silly, John.

01:12:39.236 --> 01:12:40.867
Of course we can afford it.

01:12:40.869 --> 01:12:42.334
- Um, thank you so much.
- No, no, no.

01:12:42.336 --> 01:12:43.868
It's okay. Thank you.

01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:45.367
- Here are your keys.
- Oh, thank you.

01:12:45.369 --> 01:12:46.403
Enjoy your stay.

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.770
Oh, Ella.

01:12:56.303 --> 01:12:57.838
Oh, wow.

01:12:58.369 --> 01:13:00.301
My gosh.

01:13:00.303 --> 01:13:03.068
I'm gonna get us a drink.
I think we've earned it.

01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:04.437
Excellent.

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:07.838
Oh, look.

01:13:08.569 --> 01:13:09.803
Hang on.

01:13:16.837 --> 01:13:17.871
Whoo!

I'm so sorry.

01:14:27.537 --> 01:14:29.237
- No, here. Sweetheart.
- I ruined the carpet.

01:14:31.536 --> 01:14:33.304
- Oh, darling.
- I'm so sorry.

01:14:38.836 --> 01:14:43.067
"The old man
was thin and gaunt

01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:45.503
"and had deep wrinkles
in the back of his neck.

01:14:47.269 --> 01:14:50.367
"The brown blotches
of the benevolent skin cancer

01:14:50.369 --> 01:14:52.267
"the sun brings
from its reflections

01:14:52.269 --> 01:14:54.436
"on the tropic sea
were on his cheeks.

01:14:57.236 --> 01:15:00.170
"The blotches ran well down
the sides of his face,

01:15:01.436 --> 01:15:05.400
"and his hands had
the deep-creased scars

01:15:05.402 --> 01:15:08.336
"from handling heavy
fish on the cords.

01:15:09.804 --> 01:15:13.038
"But none of those
scars was fresh.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:20.203
"They were as old as erosions
in a fishless desert."

01:15:24.803 --> 01:15:27.301
Hello, hon.

01:15:27.303 --> 01:15:30.100
- Did you sleep well?
- Oh, like a rock.

01:15:30.102 --> 01:15:32.838
- So long since I've slept that well.
- Help me, will you?

01:15:34.069 --> 01:15:36.404
Yeah, that's better.

01:15:38.102 --> 01:15:40.300
Okay. See you later.

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:43.233
I'll be back at
the usual time.

01:15:43.235 --> 01:15:45.203
Well, where are you going?

01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:51.400
This is not home.

01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:53.334
No, it's not.

01:15:53.336 --> 01:15:56.534
- Where are we?
- We're in a lovely place.

01:15:56.536 --> 01:15:58.935
This lovely place have tea?

01:15:58.937 --> 01:16:00.404
Yes, I'm sure it does.

01:16:03.269 --> 01:16:05.400
Oh...

01:16:05.402 --> 01:16:08.568
Santiago is the perfect
Hemingway character

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:12.500
because he achieves
inner spiritual success,

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:17.568
which is, for Hemingway,
what defines true man.

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:21.467
He's defeated, but
he's not destroyed.

01:16:21.469 --> 01:16:24.269
At the end of the story,
Hemingway observes the old man.

01:16:26.135 --> 01:16:27.868
Sound asleep.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:31.471
Skeleton of his great fish
still lies on the line.

01:16:32.503 --> 01:16:34.070
And Hemingway writes...

01:16:39.969 --> 01:16:41.801
Oh...

01:16:41.803 --> 01:16:43.200
I've lost it.

01:16:43.202 --> 01:16:46.867
Oh, God, and it's such
a beautiful phrase.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:50.001
And I've forgotten
it. Oh, dear.

01:16:50.003 --> 01:16:52.101
"The old man was
dreaming about lions."

01:16:52.103 --> 01:16:54.337
Oh, my God, you
know it! You know it!

01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:56.834
Oh, how wonderful.

01:16:56.836 --> 01:16:58.534
Excuse me, where
are the teaspoons?

01:16:58.536 --> 01:17:00.401
I wrote my honors thesis

01:17:00.403 --> 01:17:02.568
- on <i>The Old Man and the Sea.</i>
- How wonderful. Oh, gosh.

01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:05.300
I preferred the movie
with Spencer Tracy.

01:17:05.302 --> 01:17:09.034
There's a quote of William
Faulkner where he says,

01:17:09.036 --> 01:17:12.001
"Hemingway was one
of the bravest and the best."

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:15.802
And you can add for me
one of the purest.

01:17:15.804 --> 01:17:18.101
I totally agree.

01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:19.400
- Oh, gosh.
- Teaspoon?

01:17:19.402 --> 01:17:21.867
Uh, so sorry.

01:17:21.869 --> 01:17:23.234
Can you believe it?

01:17:23.236 --> 01:17:25.868
- No.
- She wrote her honors thesis

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:28.738
- on <i>The Old Man and the Sea.</i>
- Wow, really?

01:17:44.169 --> 01:17:45.334
Darling?

01:17:45.336 --> 01:17:48.434
Mmm.
No, no, no, don't stop.

01:17:48.436 --> 01:17:50.471
Let's just find
a campsite, okay?

01:17:51.303 --> 01:17:52.404
Okay.

01:18:00.003 --> 01:18:02.134
<i>I'm so tired.</i>

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:07.137
Um... If you're hungry, there's
some food in the fridge.

01:18:08.469 --> 01:18:10.167
Mmm.

01:18:10.169 --> 01:18:12.470
You still don't
feel right, Lillian?

01:18:15.803 --> 01:18:17.237
Oh, don't fret, please.

01:18:18.303 --> 01:18:19.970
I won't leave you on your own.

01:18:21.537 --> 01:18:23.534
Lillian?

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:25.804
I'll go home when
you feel okay.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:28.304
So,

01:18:29.369 --> 01:18:31.934
where's Ella now?

01:18:31.936 --> 01:18:33.070
Ella?

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:36.033
Ella's at home.

01:18:36.035 --> 01:18:38.002
- At home.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:18:38.837 --> 01:18:40.434
Yeah.

01:18:40.436 --> 01:18:42.503
This baby's
taking its toll on her.

01:18:44.036 --> 01:18:45.237
What am I thinking?

01:18:46.537 --> 01:18:48.937
I should be
there to help her.

01:18:50.503 --> 01:18:53.804
I really have
to go home now.

01:18:56.235 --> 01:18:57.470
Wait, John.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:00.970
Does...

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.468
Does Ella know about us?

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:07.100
You know she doesn't.

01:19:07.102 --> 01:19:09.803
I couldn't bear it if she knew.
Neither could you.

01:19:10.969 --> 01:19:12.204
It'd break her heart.

01:19:13.436 --> 01:19:15.104
It'd break mine, too.

01:19:19.435 --> 01:19:21.204
We have to stop this, Lillian.

01:19:22.537 --> 01:19:24.867
Yes.

01:19:24.869 --> 01:19:27.738
Yes, we do. We have to stop.

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:33.267
It's been going
on a long time.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.002
Way too long.

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:39.137
So, how long is too long?

01:19:40.935 --> 01:19:42.504
You don't remember?

01:19:43.503 --> 01:19:44.936
Lillian.

01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:48.370
It was nearly two years ago.

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:54.770
So,

01:19:56.135 --> 01:19:58.468
do you love me?

01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:00.368
What are you talking about?

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:03.034
You know it's not like that.

01:20:03.036 --> 01:20:07.233
You said it yourself,
this is just between friends.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:10.534
I mean, you're a wonderful
friend, Lillian, the best,

01:20:10.536 --> 01:20:14.501
but I love Ella.
Ella's the love of my life.

01:20:14.503 --> 01:20:16.334
She's everything to me,

01:20:16.336 --> 01:20:19.737
and we've got a baby on
the way, for God's sake.

01:20:20.969 --> 01:20:23.301
We have to stop this, Lillian.

01:20:23.303 --> 01:20:24.966
I'm sorry, but

01:20:24.968 --> 01:20:27.403
we have to end this
once and for all.

01:20:29.235 --> 01:20:30.937
Goodbye, dear Lillian.

01:20:33.436 --> 01:20:34.903
Goodbye.

01:20:43.803 --> 01:20:46.201
You get back here,
you son of a bitch!

01:20:46.203 --> 01:20:47.834
- You get back in here...
- Ella, what's happening?

01:20:47.836 --> 01:20:49.200
...so I can kill you!

01:20:49.202 --> 01:20:51.933
- Bastard!
- Ella, Ella, what's happening?

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:55.100
Oh! Oh, I'm Ella now,
am I? I'm Ella now.

01:20:55.102 --> 01:20:57.200
- Ella, Ella, Ella, just stop!
- Yeah, I'm Ella now.

01:20:57.202 --> 01:20:58.966
What are you doing?

01:20:58.968 --> 01:21:00.901
- Oh!
- God.

01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:02.133
Where's my phone?

01:21:02.135 --> 01:21:04.501
Ella. Ella, what's going on?

01:21:04.503 --> 01:21:06.133
Quiet, you fool.

01:21:06.135 --> 01:21:07.867
This is the end of our trip.

01:21:07.869 --> 01:21:10.134
- Hello? This is Station 37.
- What?

01:21:10.136 --> 01:21:12.867
Could you send me a taxi
here, please, ASAP.

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:14.800
A taxi?

01:21:14.802 --> 01:21:19.034
Shut up. Just shut up.

01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:23.801
- <i>Mother, where are you?</i>
- Will, what do you want?

01:21:23.803 --> 01:21:24.967
- <i>Mother!</i>
- Stop calling me.

01:21:24.969 --> 01:21:26.304
I don't want
to talk to you.

01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:33.803
Go on. Get out. Get out!

01:21:34.335 --> 01:21:36.567
Ow!

01:21:36.569 --> 01:21:39.100
- Come on.
- You guys call a cab?

01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:41.535
Do you see any other
customers standing around?

01:21:41.537 --> 01:21:43.333
Now, here's your stuff.

01:21:43.335 --> 01:21:45.433
It's your nightshirt, your
socks, your damn briefs.

01:21:45.435 --> 01:21:48.834
- What's happening, Ella?
- Just get in. Get in.

01:21:48.836 --> 01:21:52.066
Would you mind helping me load
my husband and his stupid bag?

01:21:52.068 --> 01:21:53.236
Yes, ma'am.

01:21:55.235 --> 01:21:56.534
You just stay in there.

01:21:56.536 --> 01:21:58.268
Why are you so mad?

01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:00.500
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.

01:22:00.502 --> 01:22:02.434
No, I'm relieved.

01:22:02.436 --> 01:22:05.867
Yeah, I'm happy as a clam.

01:22:05.869 --> 01:22:08.367
Would you take us to the nearest
old people's home, please?

01:22:08.369 --> 01:22:10.470
- The crummier, the better.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:22:17.435 --> 01:22:20.268
- This isn't where we live.
- No, it isn't.

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:22.934
We're at a place where they
keep old fools like you.

01:22:22.936 --> 01:22:26.101
- Ella, why are you so irritated?
- Sit down, please.

01:22:26.103 --> 01:22:27.934
This is my husband John.

01:22:27.936 --> 01:22:30.300
Um, give him a room, please.

01:22:30.302 --> 01:22:32.333
Ma'am, we cannot
accept new patients

01:22:32.335 --> 01:22:34.367
without following
established guidelines.

01:22:34.369 --> 01:22:36.267
Establish them, then.

01:22:36.269 --> 01:22:39.801
You can come tomorrow morning
at 9:30 to the intake office.

01:22:39.803 --> 01:22:42.467
If the gentleman falls within
the required parameters,

01:22:42.469 --> 01:22:44.567
he'll be put on the wait list,
which is about 10 months.

01:22:44.569 --> 01:22:47.001
Well, that sounds more
like your problem than mine.

01:22:47.003 --> 01:22:48.801
Now, here's
everything you need.

01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:51.800
His social security, his
money, his driver's license.

01:22:51.802 --> 01:22:54.500
Oh, and there's this.
This is very important.

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:57.468
This is a photograph
he cut out of a magazine.

01:22:57.470 --> 01:23:00.367
He thinks this is us.
He thinks this is his family.

01:23:00.369 --> 01:23:02.267
He carries it
around in his wallet.

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:05.167
See what I mean? That is
what you're dealing with.

01:23:05.169 --> 01:23:07.867
Well, I'm tired,
and you have work to do.

01:23:07.869 --> 01:23:10.337
So, he's all yours.

01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.867
Goodbye, John.

01:23:12.869 --> 01:23:14.134
Ma'am, you can't just...

01:23:14.136 --> 01:23:16.234
Ma'am! Ma'am, you...

01:23:16.236 --> 01:23:19.834
She must know
you can't stay here.

01:23:19.836 --> 01:23:23.033
I mean, sometimes she's
a wounded buffalo.

01:23:23.035 --> 01:23:24.468
I know that.

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:27.100
Are you familiar
with Hemingway's

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:30.301
<i>The Short Happy Life
of Francis Macomber?</i>

01:23:30.303 --> 01:23:33.500
His wife shot him
in the back of the neck

01:23:33.502 --> 01:23:35.833
with a Mannlicher 6.5.

01:23:35.835 --> 01:23:37.737
What should we do?
Call the police?

01:23:38.803 --> 01:23:40.304
I don't think they'd take him.

01:23:47.202 --> 01:23:52.467
Oh, yeah, look at you, coming into my
house with your thighs all on display.

01:23:52.469 --> 01:23:54.169
Slutty.

01:23:57.068 --> 01:23:59.300
Look at that face.

01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:02.436
Look at that face, you bitch!

01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:11.033
Look at you cozying
up to my husband.

01:24:11.035 --> 01:24:12.534
That's my husband, bitch.

01:24:12.536 --> 01:24:14.034
All romantic.

01:24:14.036 --> 01:24:16.233
Having a lovely afternoon.

01:24:16.235 --> 01:24:17.967
What about me?

01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:19.467
Having kids.

01:24:19.469 --> 01:24:21.534
Pregnant. I was pregnant
with Will then.

01:24:21.536 --> 01:24:23.467
I mean, I was pregnant.

01:24:23.469 --> 01:24:26.103
Oh, yeah, right.
Supermodel, my ass.

01:24:27.835 --> 01:24:29.901
You my friend?

01:24:29.903 --> 01:24:31.471
Worst friend in the world.

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:34.970
Jane.

01:24:36.303 --> 01:24:38.036
Oh, you knew.

01:24:41.402 --> 01:24:42.802
Jane.

01:24:44.235 --> 01:24:47.802
You knew, and you
never said a word.

01:24:52.569 --> 01:24:53.870
Hey.

01:24:58.902 --> 01:25:00.936
- Is it them?
- Yeah, it's Mom.

01:25:02.136 --> 01:25:03.900
Hello.

01:25:03.902 --> 01:25:06.499
Your father fooled me my whole
life, and you knew it.

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.133
Mom? What's happening?

01:25:08.135 --> 01:25:09.567
- Where are you?
- <i>You never said a word.</i>

01:25:09.569 --> 01:25:12.566
Always on his side.
Professor, my ass.

01:25:12.568 --> 01:25:15.566
What's wrong? I'm at the
house with Phillip and Will.

01:25:15.568 --> 01:25:18.400
We're all here waiting for you.
Where are you? Let us come get you.

01:25:18.402 --> 01:25:21.034
<i>I'm alone. I got
rid of your father.</i>

01:25:21.036 --> 01:25:24.300
And I'm coming back home, or
maybe I'm going to the beach.

01:25:24.302 --> 01:25:26.168
- I don't know. I...
- Mom?

01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:28.033
- Where's Dad?
- <i>I never want to see him again.</i>

01:25:28.035 --> 01:25:30.533
I'm finally free of that horrible
creature who ruined my life.

01:25:30.535 --> 01:25:32.400
- <i>I don't give a damn about Hemingway...</i>
- <i>What the fuck?</i>

01:25:32.402 --> 01:25:33.801
<i>...or Melville or those</i>

01:25:33.803 --> 01:25:35.900
- pedantic little lectures...
- Mom.

01:25:35.902 --> 01:25:39.200
that you went on and on and on,
always made me feel like an idiot.

01:25:39.202 --> 01:25:41.933
- Mom, you have to...
- He lived his whole life a lie.

01:25:41.935 --> 01:25:44.533
It was all a lie. I mean, what
do you read in all those books?

01:25:44.535 --> 01:25:46.300
- <i>It's just lies.</i>
- Mom, calm down and listen to me.

01:25:46.302 --> 01:25:47.967
Where's Dad?

01:25:47.969 --> 01:25:50.834
I think he's lying
about being senile now.

01:25:50.836 --> 01:25:52.101
He's just an impostor.

01:25:52.103 --> 01:25:54.067
You didn't leave
him alone, did you?

01:25:54.069 --> 01:25:56.334
<i>You never thought you'd have
a vindictive mother, did you?</i>

01:25:56.336 --> 01:25:57.833
<i>You made me like this.</i>

01:25:57.835 --> 01:26:00.836
You. And him.
You just go to hell.

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:11.902
Where's my whiskey?

01:26:33.335 --> 01:26:35.334
Jane, sweetheart.

01:26:35.336 --> 01:26:37.399
I don't know what
came over me.

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:40.367
I think it must
have been my meds.

01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:43.100
No, no, your daddy's fine.

01:26:43.102 --> 01:26:44.967
I was only joking.

01:26:44.969 --> 01:26:47.234
I would never abandon him.

01:26:47.236 --> 01:26:50.066
Jane, Jane, listen, darling.

01:26:50.068 --> 01:26:51.966
I want you to do me a favor.

01:26:51.968 --> 01:26:53.233
A favor?

01:26:53.235 --> 01:26:55.133
Listen, could you
go to Lillian,

01:26:55.135 --> 01:26:57.467
- <i>give her a message for me?</i>
- Mom, Lillian is right here.

01:26:57.469 --> 01:26:59.867
Tell her she's
the dirtiest whore on Earth.

01:26:59.869 --> 01:27:03.066
- What did you say?
- <i>No, in the universe.</i>

01:27:03.068 --> 01:27:05.901
The dirtiest whore
in the whole universe.

01:27:05.903 --> 01:27:07.866
Thanks.

01:27:07.868 --> 01:27:09.036
Where's my husband?

01:27:11.802 --> 01:27:13.170
So, what's happening?

01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:16.333
Nothing. Everything's fine.

01:27:16.335 --> 01:27:18.937
- But where are they?
- I have no idea.

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:24.100
But Mom seems very energized.

01:27:24.102 --> 01:27:25.467
She sends her love, Lillian.

01:27:25.469 --> 01:27:28.137
Oh. So sweet.

01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:32.770
Hi, darling.

01:27:42.302 --> 01:27:46.399
Now I understand everything.

01:27:46.401 --> 01:27:49.300
You won't remember this,
but you came home one night,

01:27:49.302 --> 01:27:53.034
and I was cleaning
the kitchen floor.

01:27:53.036 --> 01:27:56.499
I was all hot and sweaty
and stinky and...

01:27:56.501 --> 01:27:59.033
I was seven months pregnant.

01:27:59.035 --> 01:28:01.101
Ma'am, is everything all right?

01:28:01.103 --> 01:28:02.566
Is there someone
we can call for you?

01:28:02.568 --> 01:28:04.435
Can't you see I'm speaking
with my husband?

01:28:06.302 --> 01:28:09.432
So you got down on the floor
with me to help me.

01:28:09.434 --> 01:28:11.466
And then later on,
when I was taking a bath,

01:28:11.468 --> 01:28:15.000
you got in the tub with me.

01:28:15.002 --> 01:28:17.866
And I didn't know
anything, but I just...

01:28:17.868 --> 01:28:19.402
I sensed that you...

01:28:20.968 --> 01:28:23.103
That you returned to me.

01:28:24.302 --> 01:28:27.970
And knowing nothing,
I forgave you.

01:28:40.836 --> 01:28:44.167
This fella there,
he's a Bulls fan.

01:28:44.169 --> 01:28:48.067
And Raymond Chandler
was a Bulls fan, too.

01:28:48.069 --> 01:28:52.367
Hemingway liked bulls,
but they were in Spain.

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:55.432
You really should be going.
It's Mr. Davidson's bedtime.

01:28:55.434 --> 01:29:00.200
Don't worry. I'm not leaving my husband
in this dump to be treated like a fool.

01:29:00.202 --> 01:29:01.533
Come on, John.

01:29:01.535 --> 01:29:03.236
Come on. We're leaving.

01:29:06.569 --> 01:29:08.104
Pleasure to see you.

01:29:09.535 --> 01:29:11.333
May I keep this?

01:29:11.335 --> 01:29:14.168
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:16.033
- Here, dear.
- And now...

01:29:16.035 --> 01:29:18.499
I have to forgive
you all over again.

01:29:18.501 --> 01:29:21.267
- Forty-eight years later.
- Thank you, Ella.

01:29:21.269 --> 01:29:25.100
I don't know if I'm a bitch
or you're a son of a bitch.

01:29:25.102 --> 01:29:27.736
Well, I guess
anything's possible.

01:29:46.235 --> 01:29:48.333
- John, pull over.
- Why?

01:29:48.335 --> 01:29:50.433
I want to get down
and take a look.

01:29:50.435 --> 01:29:52.267
I want a burger.

01:29:52.269 --> 01:29:55.332
John, pull this camper
over immediately.

01:29:55.334 --> 01:29:57.432
I want to get down
and take a look.

01:29:57.434 --> 01:29:59.003
Yes, sir.

01:30:17.135 --> 01:30:20.803
Oh, look, John.
It is so beautiful.

01:30:30.968 --> 01:30:32.235
Are we there yet?

01:30:33.868 --> 01:30:35.036
Almost.

01:30:41.935 --> 01:30:43.136
Mmm.

01:30:48.102 --> 01:30:49.469
Is this Heaven?

01:30:51.134 --> 01:30:52.302
Maybe.

01:30:55.835 --> 01:30:58.834
Do you think a guy can
get a burger up here?

01:31:02.202 --> 01:31:03.802
What are you laughing at?

01:31:10.401 --> 01:31:11.800
Hey, neighbors.

01:31:11.802 --> 01:31:13.933
- You going to Hemingway House?
- Yes.

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.867
There's a great restaurant
right next door to it.

01:31:15.869 --> 01:31:17.067
You're gonna love it.

01:31:17.069 --> 01:31:18.801
- Really?
- Yep. I mean...

01:31:18.803 --> 01:31:21.400
And the Hemingway House,
you won't believe it.

01:31:21.402 --> 01:31:24.399
It's become like
the party town of all places.

01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:28.001
My cousin, he got married
like three weeks ago there,

01:31:28.003 --> 01:31:30.200
and we had the
time of our lives.

01:31:30.202 --> 01:31:32.266
I mean, I got some
amazing pictures of it,

01:31:32.268 --> 01:31:33.433
if you want to see.

01:31:33.435 --> 01:31:35.299
On my camera and on my phone.

01:31:35.301 --> 01:31:37.934
You could look at them
anywhere you want.

01:31:37.936 --> 01:31:40.833
Well, you don't
want to see them?

01:31:40.835 --> 01:31:42.466
They're really cool.

01:31:42.468 --> 01:31:45.466
It was acquired by
the museum in 1974.

01:31:45.468 --> 01:31:50.132
Before that when Hemingway and
his wife lived here, it was...

01:31:50.134 --> 01:31:52.232
Folks, this is
Ernest Hemingway as he looked

01:31:52.234 --> 01:31:56.366
while he was living down here in
Key West, Florida, late '30s.

01:31:56.368 --> 01:31:59.934
Dark, swarthy,
very charismatic-looking man.

01:31:59.936 --> 01:32:02.232
And also, folks,
in every single room...

01:32:02.234 --> 01:32:05.467
Each cat has a
very particular feature.

01:32:05.469 --> 01:32:08.500
They have six
claws, and this...

01:32:17.102 --> 01:32:20.199
This is unbelievable.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.533
Yeah.

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:23.567
Ella, it's a wedding.

01:32:23.569 --> 01:32:25.203
Come on.

01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:31.332
I'm so sorry. You always
wanted to come here.

01:32:31.334 --> 01:32:33.502
Now look at it.

01:32:49.168 --> 01:32:50.866
Excuse me. Where's
the bathroom?

01:32:50.868 --> 01:32:53.000
I don't know.
Maybe try outside.

01:32:53.002 --> 01:32:54.302
Thank you.

01:32:58.802 --> 01:33:00.169
Oh, gosh.

01:33:01.169 --> 01:33:02.567
You okay?

01:33:02.569 --> 01:33:04.333
Call 911.

01:33:04.335 --> 01:33:06.770
Is her husband
or family anywhere around?

01:34:08.468 --> 01:34:10.232
No.

01:34:10.234 --> 01:34:12.432
No, please don't...

01:34:12.434 --> 01:34:14.099
No, don't take...

01:34:14.101 --> 01:34:15.737
My husband John.

01:34:16.469 --> 01:34:18.002
Don't take me, please.

01:34:49.901 --> 01:34:52.432
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

01:34:52.434 --> 01:34:56.333
I'm looking for...

01:34:56.335 --> 01:34:58.169
Uh, looking for?

01:34:59.135 --> 01:35:01.033
Help me, please.

01:35:01.035 --> 01:35:03.166
Are you looking for
the bathroom?

01:35:03.168 --> 01:35:06.168
It's out back, by
the souvenir shop.

01:35:07.901 --> 01:35:09.167
Do you feel okay?

01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:10.233
Thank you.

01:35:10.235 --> 01:35:12.102
You've been very helpful.

01:35:28.402 --> 01:35:29.533
Huh.

01:35:29.535 --> 01:35:32.236
Yeah. I'm looking for my wife.

01:35:48.435 --> 01:35:49.902
Sir?

01:35:50.501 --> 01:35:52.099
My wife?

01:35:52.101 --> 01:35:53.567
You'll have to check
with the desk inside.

01:35:53.569 --> 01:35:55.367
That'll be $35, please.

01:35:55.369 --> 01:35:57.500
Don't worry about it.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:59.499
Hey, hey. Don't try
and pull that.

01:35:59.501 --> 01:36:01.866
- You owe me 35 bucks.
- I do?

01:36:01.868 --> 01:36:04.399
Yeah.

01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:06.900
In order to figure out what
was causing these symptoms,

01:36:06.902 --> 01:36:09.065
we did a full-body CAT scan.

01:36:09.067 --> 01:36:10.965
We certainly weren't expecting

01:36:10.967 --> 01:36:14.300
to find a situation
as grave as what we found.

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:17.203
The original tumor was in the
colon, wasn't it, Mr. Spencer?

01:36:18.268 --> 01:36:19.399
Yes.

01:36:19.401 --> 01:36:21.499
I'm John Spencer.

01:36:21.501 --> 01:36:25.066
But now there's been
a blood-borne spread

01:36:25.068 --> 01:36:29.432
through the lymphatic system,
attacking almost all internal organs.

01:36:29.434 --> 01:36:31.800
To be honest with
you, Mr. Spencer,

01:36:31.802 --> 01:36:35.400
it's amazing she's even alive with
her blood chemistry readings.

01:36:35.402 --> 01:36:38.169
Were you really
taking an RV trip?

01:36:41.269 --> 01:36:43.001
Where is my wife?

01:36:52.434 --> 01:36:53.968
John.

01:36:55.368 --> 01:36:57.534
How'd you get here?

01:36:57.536 --> 01:36:59.233
I brought you something.

01:36:59.235 --> 01:37:01.236
Oh, my bag.

01:37:02.802 --> 01:37:04.136
Oh...

01:37:05.234 --> 01:37:06.736
Hi, honey.

01:37:11.401 --> 01:37:13.366
Could we have
some privacy, please?

01:37:13.368 --> 01:37:15.335
Oh. Sorry.

01:37:16.535 --> 01:37:19.333
- Put this on.
- What?

01:37:19.335 --> 01:37:22.267
- Let's get out of here.
- No. No, John.

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.366
- Where are your shoes?
- Now they've got me,

01:37:23.368 --> 01:37:25.300
they're not gonna let me go.

01:37:25.302 --> 01:37:27.166
They're not going
to stop you, either.

01:37:27.168 --> 01:37:29.303
Well, they're down
there somewhere.

01:37:31.502 --> 01:37:34.169
Okay. I'm ready.

01:37:36.469 --> 01:37:38.268
Which is the way out?

01:37:39.334 --> 01:37:40.999
Exit?

01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:43.069
Just around the corner.
You're almost there.

01:37:49.435 --> 01:37:51.369
You're my hero.

01:37:55.901 --> 01:37:57.965
John.

01:37:57.967 --> 01:38:01.266
You're peeing.
We're in a taxi.

01:38:01.268 --> 01:38:03.736
- I thought it felt warm.
- Just stop.

01:38:08.368 --> 01:38:11.435
- It's that one over there.
- Yeah.

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:22.302
Thank you. Thank you
so much. Thank you.

01:38:29.168 --> 01:38:30.901
Thank you.

01:38:45.401 --> 01:38:46.969
Okay.

01:38:51.101 --> 01:38:52.268
Home.

01:38:57.802 --> 01:38:59.002
Mmm.

01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:01.969
Mmm.

01:39:10.867 --> 01:39:15.169
You need to change, John.
Here. Put your nightshirt on.

01:39:19.202 --> 01:39:23.267
I lost all hope
in the hospital.

01:39:23.269 --> 01:39:26.802
I thought I would never see
the Leisure Seeker again.

01:39:30.134 --> 01:39:32.935
I think we both
need a good nap.

01:39:55.902 --> 01:39:57.799
Here, darling.

01:39:57.801 --> 01:39:59.302
Here, drink this.

01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:01.936
Drink it all up.

01:40:04.234 --> 01:40:05.335
Mmm.

01:40:14.001 --> 01:40:16.502
Come here. You haven't even
washed yourself.

01:40:17.368 --> 01:40:18.768
Come on.

01:40:22.301 --> 01:40:23.469
Here.

01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:28.102
Here we go.

01:40:31.001 --> 01:40:32.035
Oh.

01:40:34.202 --> 01:40:35.769
Hello, sweetheart.

01:40:39.968 --> 01:40:43.235
Well done, but you can
stand down, soldier.

01:40:47.534 --> 01:40:49.869
John, what are you doing?

01:40:51.135 --> 01:40:52.932
- We'll try.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:40:52.934 --> 01:40:54.899
- No, just for a second.
- No, I don't think I can.

01:40:54.901 --> 01:40:57.036
Just for a second.
Just for a second.

01:41:11.934 --> 01:41:13.735
- I'm there.
- Yes.

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.432
You are.

01:41:16.434 --> 01:41:18.769
You're all the way there.

01:41:20.368 --> 01:41:22.532
Don't move.

01:41:22.534 --> 01:41:24.968
- You don't want to come?
- No.

01:41:26.501 --> 01:41:28.002
Just this.

01:41:30.268 --> 01:41:34.068
Oh, John,
I love you so much.

01:41:37.902 --> 01:41:39.933
Don't leave me again.

01:41:39.935 --> 01:41:41.069
All right?

01:41:42.867 --> 01:41:44.901
- All right.
- You promise?

01:41:46.269 --> 01:41:47.802
Oh, I promise.

01:41:53.235 --> 01:41:54.269
Oh, God.

01:41:56.102 --> 01:41:57.136
Oh, God.

01:44:53.269 --> 01:44:55.199
<i>My darling
Will and Jane.</i>

01:44:55.201 --> 01:44:57.965
<i>Here's our lawyer's number.</i>

01:44:57.967 --> 01:45:01.366
<i>I've taken care of everything,
all the arrangements.</i>

01:45:01.368 --> 01:45:04.233
<i>There's nothing for you to
worry about,</i>

01:45:04.235 --> 01:45:09.299
<i>although I think our final
Visa bill will be outrageous.</i>

01:45:09.301 --> 01:45:12.533
<i>We had a little bit
of fun there at the end.</i>

01:45:12.535 --> 01:45:15.169
<i>I'm so sorry to
hurt you like this.</i>

01:45:16.268 --> 01:45:18.965
<i>I know how painful it must be.</i>

01:45:18.967 --> 01:45:21.966
<i>But pretty soon you're going
to feel something else.</i>

01:45:21.968 --> 01:45:24.200
<i>You're going to feel relief.</i>

01:45:24.202 --> 01:45:27.033
<i>Relief that you don't have
to watch our bodies</i>

01:45:27.035 --> 01:45:29.533
<i>and our minds fade away.</i>

01:45:29.535 --> 01:45:34.833
<i>Relief that the burden we were becoming
has been lifted from your shoulders.</i>

01:45:34.835 --> 01:45:37.032
<i>And you mustn't feel
guilty about that.</i>

01:45:37.034 --> 01:45:38.365
<i>You mustn't.</i>

01:45:38.367 --> 01:45:41.232
<i>I loved your father very much.</i>

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:43.431
<i>I didn't have much longer,</i>

01:45:43.433 --> 01:45:46.398
<i>and I couldn't
leave him alone.</i>

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.565
<i>We were always together.</i>

01:45:48.567 --> 01:45:51.103
<i>And I hope we're together
somewhere now.</i>

01:45:51.934 --> 01:45:53.399
<i>Who knows?</i>

01:45:53.401 --> 01:45:56.399
<i>This was our last
wonderful vacation.</i>

01:45:56.401 --> 01:45:59.266
<i>We had some beautiful days.</i>

01:45:59.268 --> 01:46:02.036
<i>It was our happy ending.</i>

01:46:03.368 --> 01:46:05.435
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

01:46:06.401 --> 01:46:08.169
How you doing, kiddo?

01:46:09.101 --> 01:46:10.267
