01:46.239 --> 01:50.442
- A small town and
no one can flee from betrayal.

01:51.211 --> 01:54.613
And evil is looming too,
he writes their tale.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.715
From deep within hell

01:57.450 --> 01:58.750
a curse rises up,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.589
to strike down the
old and never give up.

02:04.691 --> 02:08.327
The elderly dead will
smell blood in the air,

02:09.162 --> 02:10.829
eating flesh of the young,

02:11.664 --> 02:13.565
and the world will despair.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.228
- Ed, where's gem?

03:17.230 --> 03:18.430
- Babysittin'.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.399
- I know where
she is, I was just

03:20.401 --> 03:21.867
checkin' to see if you knew.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.269
- I know where she is.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.740
- I do miss this place.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.212
- I don't miss this
church, it creeps me out.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.547
- I miss my mum's apple pie.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.283
- I miss your mum's apple pie.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.887
- We used to have some wicked
halloweens here, didn't we?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.890
- Before, but
nothing ever happens.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.892
We should do something.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.328
- Fancy dress?
- Whoa,

03:49.330 --> 03:52.264
shocker'd Freddy,
i got the claws.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.269
- I've got a sheep costume.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.337
- I want it.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.541
- Do you remember
your 18th birthday

04:02.543 --> 04:04.977
when I said I was coming
as the invisible man?

04:04.979 --> 04:06.612
And I just didn't show up?

04:06.614 --> 04:09.414
- That was good, that,
no one saw you all night.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.916
- You need a shave.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.654
- So do you.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.522
- Oi!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.358
- I love the beard.
- Yeah, beards rock.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.660
- I'm hurt.
- Ah.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.296
- Oh, don't please grow a beard.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.765
- Oh, I wish I could.
- Aw.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.035
- Now gas can grow
a bloody good beard.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.606
- I heard he's bangin'
a ripe little thing.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.676
- I heard she's really filthy.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.845
- I'm his best mate
and he hasn't told me.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.382
- You know i
don't like thunder.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.784
- You are just
scared of everythin'.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.758
- Right, I'm off, got
work in the mornin'.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.726
Don't forget the parents
are back tomorrow,

04:54.728 --> 04:56.795
and nan's still ill, so.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.831
Mm, look after her.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.035
Just for one more day, please.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.871
Otherwise I'll be in shit, too.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.941
- Shadow on the wall.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.005
- Why are you here?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.814
- Come on!

08:04.617 --> 08:07.219
- Okay nan, it's
time to wake up.

08:12.992 --> 08:13.925
Lazy cow.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.623
Oh, shit!

08:55.902 --> 09:00.105
Look I need you to do something
for me, it's an emergency.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.308
- Oh, it better be
a bloody emergency.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.613
- Don't hurt me!

09:10.217 --> 09:12.717
- Zombies take over
the planet?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.886
- Well, not sure about
the whole planet but

09:14.888 --> 09:16.688
definitely our town.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.659
Ah, no, no!

09:21.294 --> 09:22.827
Oh, Jesus, jeez!

09:25.131 --> 09:27.032
Oh, by god!

09:27.034 --> 09:28.266
- Okay listen up.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.036
If this is for real,
there's a few rules.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.939
Firstly, do not
leave your house.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.575
In the first few hours
of a zombie attack,

09:36.577 --> 09:40.111
people will try to escape
because most people are dumb.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.048
Roads will become a
mess, the town a panic.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.251
Stay in your room,
load up on weapons,

09:46.986 --> 09:48.019
prepare to kick ass.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.822
But stay put, and stay alert.

10:45.711 --> 10:46.711
- Hey, boy.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.880
- Listen, nan is from hell.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.316
She's gone fuckin'
mad, what do I do?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.250
- Fuck!

10:54.787 --> 10:55.720
Ed!

10:56.255 --> 10:57.856
My neighbor's a zombie!

10:58.391 --> 10:59.758
- Quick, go away.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.462
Shit!

11:56.916 --> 11:59.718
- I'm locked in my room, the
whole town might be infected.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.452
- No shit.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.328
- Billy!

12:43.330 --> 12:45.497
- I can't really talk
at the mo, my mum,

12:45.499 --> 12:47.298
she's really pissed!

13:06.051 --> 13:06.918
- God.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.854
I can see his brains!
- No no, no don't look,

13:09.856 --> 13:14.058
don't look.
- Look away!

13:48.127 --> 13:49.260
- She's gone.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.361
- Okay.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.965
So turn around and
stay in your room.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.468
- I'm gonna check it out.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.539
- Okay what was the
point in phonin' me, huh?

15:19.652 --> 15:23.254
Oh, my god!

15:25.692 --> 15:26.624
Shit!

15:36.135 --> 15:37.068
Dai,

15:38.270 --> 15:39.203
I'm back

15:40.306 --> 15:41.706
in my room again.

15:43.008 --> 15:43.942
- Good.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.109
Idiot.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.946
Now listen to me and stay put.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.549
- Dude, I think nan was
cooking up pancakes.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.517
- Pancakes?

15:53.352 --> 15:54.452
- Well, a fucked up pancake.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.587
She's cooking up my cat, she--
- yes!

15:56.589 --> 15:59.557
Zombies will have some
sort of memories left over.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.592
I think certain things
might trigger or stimulate

16:01.594 --> 16:04.963
whatever memories it
has, and act them out.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.632
But she's not all
there, remember.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.468
It's said, the
earlier the zombie,

16:10.470 --> 16:13.037
the more memories it has left.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.039
But soon they'll all disappear,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.441
and all that's left
is its instinct

16:16.443 --> 16:18.643
to eat the livings' flesh.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.614
Look.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.716
Next thing you should
do is phone the police.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.385
The zombie attack might
only be on your street

18:07.387 --> 18:10.855
if you're lucky, so a bit
of help might come in handy.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.825
But don't mention the
zombie thing, okay?

18:13.827 --> 18:16.094
- Right, what are you gonna do?

18:16.096 --> 18:16.828
- Me?

18:17.796 --> 18:19.497
I'm gonna stay put.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.200
Load up on weapons,

18:22.734 --> 18:24.802
and prepare to kick ass.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.805
- Hello,
blackwood police station,

18:27.807 --> 18:30.108
how can I help?
- Yes, uh,

18:31.210 --> 18:33.811
my name is ed, I live at
number nine, high view.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.446
I've got a huge problem.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.381
My nan has gone crazy.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.385
She's very old, and she
doesn't know what she's doing,

18:41.387 --> 18:43.254
but she has a shotgun

18:43.856 --> 18:45.356
and she's shooting up the house.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.358
I need help, the
bitch has gone mad.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.528
- We take prank
calls very seriously.

18:50.829 --> 18:51.429
- Prank?

18:52.264 --> 18:53.331
I am totally fucking serious,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.466
my nan has gone completely nuts.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.535
She's been tryin' to
kill me all morning!

18:57.537 --> 19:00.271
- Look sir, wasting police
time is a criminal offense.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.205
- What?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.641
She's already killed my cat.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.676
I loved little moggy.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.811
- Please, sir.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.746
- Okay, all right.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.683
I am wasting police time so

19:14.486 --> 19:16.888
you'd best send someone
around here to punish me.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.157
- Okay, just for the record,

19:19.159 --> 19:21.592
are you saying that your
nan doesn't have a gun

19:21.594 --> 19:23.628
and she isn't
trying to shoot you?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.863
- No, I have the
fucking gun, bitch!

19:25.865 --> 19:27.832
Now if I were you I'd
send someone round,

19:27.834 --> 19:30.268
'cause if you don't
I'm gonna have to,

19:30.270 --> 19:34.305
have to blow my nan's
goddamn head off instead.

19:59.932 --> 20:00.865
- Oh,

20:01.466 --> 20:01.832
holy shit!

20:02.768 --> 20:03.834
- What?

20:03.836 --> 20:08.239
- I am seeing an old man
attacking the milkman!

20:08.674 --> 20:09.540
- What?

20:11.343 --> 20:12.276
- Oh!

20:16.815 --> 20:18.216
Oh, he's okay!

20:18.850 --> 20:20.284
The milkman has survived.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.219
Ha!

20:21.753 --> 20:23.221
Well, not for long.

20:23.622 --> 20:24.488
- Why?

20:25.224 --> 20:25.923
- He was injured.

20:26.758 --> 20:28.693
Oh, we are in serious shit.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.662
Oh, my god, ed.

20:31.664 --> 20:36.567
There is a group of old
zombies walkin' down my street!

20:38.303 --> 20:40.605
How many zombies have you seen?

20:40.607 --> 20:43.674
- Two, my nan and
zimmer frame lady.

20:44.943 --> 20:48.379
Oh plus Corey said his
neighbor was a zombie, too.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.514
- Hmm, he was old, right?

20:52.417 --> 20:53.351
- Yeah.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.586
- With all the zimmers
outside my window,

20:55.588 --> 20:57.855
I've only seen old zombies.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.258
- Old zombies?

21:00.592 --> 21:01.259
- Yeah.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.361
Well in theory only
the dead are turned,

21:03.363 --> 21:04.729
but your nan wasn't dead, right?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.497
- No, but she was pretty ill.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.334
- Then my guess is an infection
has spread over the town

21:10.336 --> 21:12.436
but it's only taken the old.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.606
The weaker will always get
infected first I guess.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.608
- Well there was something else.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.644
She had white eyes and then

21:19.646 --> 21:21.979
and then she had black eyes.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.482
Like she had a demon face.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.618
My nan's a zombie demon!

21:27.620 --> 21:28.552
- Really?

21:29.554 --> 21:32.356
Then maybe it
isn't an infection.

21:33.358 --> 21:34.692
Maybe it's something
supernatural

21:34.694 --> 21:36.761
and the old can't fight it.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.329
It's just a theory.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.665
- You say the old get taken.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.434
I can't help thinkin' one thing.

21:55.047 --> 21:55.980
- Ed.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.549
This is Eddie, fuckin' hell?

21:58.551 --> 21:59.483
- Gaz.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.954
I need you to listen up and
tell me the truth, okay?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.791
Are you still sleeping
with Billy's nan?

22:06.793 --> 22:07.692
- What?

22:08.393 --> 22:10.428
Hey, that was a one-off.

22:10.829 --> 22:11.662
I was weak.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.998
She came on to me.

22:15.033 --> 22:16.434
What kind of a friend
do you think I am?

22:16.436 --> 22:18.502
- Shit, gaz, you're
still shagging her.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.539
- Oh, you know me too well.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.574
Yeah, still bangin'
the old bird.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.376
I can't stop myself.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.912
I love the elderly, dude.

22:28.647 --> 22:29.647
It's a rush for me.

22:30.382 --> 22:31.615
I'm at hers right now.

22:31.617 --> 22:32.550
- Shit.

22:33.618 --> 22:34.819
Right, I need you
to listen to me.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.621
You need to get out
of there right now.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.757
- I can't be stopped, ed.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.660
She's like a dirty little drug.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.097
- Gaz, get the fuck out of
there, she's a fucking zombie!

22:46.099 --> 22:47.465
- Zombie?

22:47.467 --> 22:50.034
You cheeky fuck,
she's not that old.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.604
Anyway, uh, really
have to go, ed,

22:53.606 --> 22:55.139
but I'll do you a favor,

22:55.141 --> 22:58.442
leave the phone on
so you can listen in.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.611
She's a fuckin' screamer.

23:01.079 --> 23:02.079
- You dick!

23:03.715 --> 23:06.150
She's gonna fucking kill you!

23:07.886 --> 23:09.754
- Not so--

23:13.425 --> 23:15.059
what the devil is this
with fucking those teeth?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.431
You fucking bitch!
- Gaz!

23:20.766 --> 23:21.699
Gaz!

23:35.881 --> 23:36.814
Gaz?

23:38.483 --> 23:39.417
You okay?

23:41.486 --> 23:42.420
Shit.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.121
Fuck.

23:47.659 --> 23:48.592
Fuck.

23:54.466 --> 23:55.199
Billy?

23:56.034 --> 23:57.501
How's it goin'?

23:57.803 --> 23:58.202
- Ed.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.006
It's the worst day
of my fuckin' life.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.575
- Can't be that bad, mate.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.645
- Well, I think me
mum's from hell.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.980
She's got a face like a demon.

24:09.982 --> 24:10.981
It's funny.

24:10.983 --> 24:16.220
My dad always said, "your
mum's the fucking devil, son."

24:17.889 --> 24:20.658
Couldn't get much
worse than this.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.592
- Yeah.

24:24.864 --> 24:25.796
Shit!

24:45.917 --> 24:47.017
- Look, mate,

24:48.520 --> 24:50.888
I am sorry about shootin'
your uncle in the face.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.090
- It's all right.
- He was comin' right at us.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.193
- He was trying to kill us.
- He was.

24:57.796 --> 25:01.031
- Did you have to
shoot my dog, though?

25:01.566 --> 25:01.932
- Well,

25:02.667 --> 25:03.901
you can't be too sure.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.970
- But you, yeah you can.

25:06.805 --> 25:07.972
- He had a look in his eye.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.707
- He's always got
that look in his eye.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.108
He's got one eye.

25:39.004 --> 25:39.937
- Uh,

25:40.639 --> 25:42.006
there's one to sign for.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.644
I'll just leave
it here, shall I?

26:28.787 --> 26:29.720
- Dai.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.255
Gaz is dead.

26:31.923 --> 26:32.856
- No way.

26:33.325 --> 26:34.858
- Not only that.

26:35.694 --> 26:36.927
I think the police turned up.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.697
There was a lot of
screaming and now

26:41.666 --> 26:42.900
there's nothing

26:44.703 --> 26:45.769
but silence.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.373
I don't get it.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.208
The door was locked.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.044
He must have got
attacked from outside.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.246
- In that case it's
already started.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.649
They've begun to roam the town.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.918
- What am I supposed to do?

27:01.987 --> 27:03.354
- Well, there's only
two things you can do:

27:03.356 --> 27:05.322
Secure the house
and kill your nan,

27:05.324 --> 27:08.959
or stay put and wait for
this to all blow over.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.895
- I don't think i
can kill my nan.

29:21.960 --> 29:22.893
Billy.

29:22.895 --> 29:26.029
There's something I need
to tell you, it's been,

29:26.031 --> 29:27.765
it's been buggin'
me all morning.

29:27.767 --> 29:31.969
- Trust me, ed, nothing's
gonna bother me right now.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.539
- Gaz has been
shagging your nan.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.540
- You what?

29:40.044 --> 29:41.545
- See where I got your uncle?

29:41.547 --> 29:43.213
Look, brains left.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.885
Brainy, brainy, brainy.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.386
Brainy.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.459
- It's too soon for that.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.060
- Brainy.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.962
- It's too soon.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.276
- Got a prank call, number nine.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.178
Possible crazies with shotguns.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.179
- Shotguns?

30:15.480 --> 30:16.213
Shit.

30:16.215 --> 30:20.050
Only the other night I was
watchin' hobo with a shotgun.

30:20.052 --> 30:20.984
Seen it?

30:21.452 --> 30:22.386
- No.

30:23.288 --> 30:24.188
Any good?
- Awesome.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.391
Craziest fucked-up
film I've ever seen.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.314
I need help

30:50.316 --> 30:51.315
at number nine high view--
- sir?

30:51.317 --> 30:52.883
- And there's--
- you okay?

30:52.885 --> 30:55.886
- A man here without a hand.
- You all right, sir?

30:55.888 --> 31:00.090
- Right, I'll go around the
back, keep an eye on him.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.528
- Sir, can you
turn around please?

31:04.530 --> 31:07.497
Sir, can you tell
me what happened?

31:12.003 --> 31:13.370
Sir, stay right there!

31:13.372 --> 31:15.405
Don't fuckin' move.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.407
I said stay there, sir!

31:18.943 --> 31:22.646
Stay there!

31:26.351 --> 31:27.284
Fuck.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.123
Oh, Christ!

32:01.386 --> 32:02.185
- Up here!

32:02.520 --> 32:03.320
Up here.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.956
Whoa, don't shoot me!

32:06.391 --> 32:07.190
- Keep still.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.192
Right, what the fuck's going on?

32:09.194 --> 32:11.929
We've had reports of
man here with a shotgun.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.397
- Uh, not exactly,

32:14.699 --> 32:17.234
but there is a mad old woman
in there, trying to kill me.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.669
She's in the house somewhere.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.337
- She has a shotgun?

32:20.339 --> 32:21.271
- Uh.

32:21.572 --> 32:22.472
Yeah.

32:23.541 --> 32:25.642
I'd shoot to kill,
she's gone insane.

32:41.025 --> 32:42.726
- Get back, get back!

32:46.998 --> 32:49.566
Shit.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.384
Shit!

33:57.235 --> 33:58.168
- Shit!

33:59.203 --> 34:00.303
Where is she?

34:01.239 --> 34:02.339
Have you seen her?
- No.

34:02.341 --> 34:06.576
You mind telling me
what the hell that is?

34:07.645 --> 34:08.578
- That

34:09.380 --> 34:11.313
is my dead cat, moggy.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.317
Sleeping in a pile of shit.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.356
- What's really goin' on here?

34:20.257 --> 34:21.458
- The truth is

34:22.527 --> 34:24.194
my nan's a zombie.

34:25.329 --> 34:26.329
- A zombie?

34:26.664 --> 34:27.597
- Yeah,

34:28.331 --> 34:29.766
and she ate my cat.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.708
Shoot the bitch!

34:44.549 --> 34:45.581
She's gone.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.190
- Oh, no!

34:54.193 --> 34:55.192
Oh, my god.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.266
- Why didn't you shoot him?

35:03.268 --> 35:04.234
- Shoot him?

35:04.236 --> 35:05.669
You mean my fuckin' partner?

35:05.671 --> 35:06.603
- He's a zombie!
- Ah,

35:06.605 --> 35:08.839
back the fuck off, zombies.

35:09.574 --> 35:10.474
They're bullshit.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.309
Let me think a second.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.578
- While you think about
things I'm gonna take a shit.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.246
- You take a shit
and I'll shoot you.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.180
- What?

35:17.615 --> 35:18.548
Fuck.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.551
- Hello, come in.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.653
This is Harvey here,

35:23.655 --> 35:25.589
we have a real serious
situation, I need back-up.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.724
Hello?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.159
Officer ts5291.

35:30.361 --> 35:33.864
I need assistance, come in.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.700
What the fuck is going on?

35:36.702 --> 35:39.636
- It's spread.
- What, the zombies?

35:40.471 --> 35:41.838
- They've taken over the old,

35:41.840 --> 35:43.607
now it looks like the
whole village is infected.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.343
- Infected, by zombies?
- Yeah.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.746
- Well you got a signal
on that phone of yours?

35:49.748 --> 35:51.148
- Oh, not yet.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.450
One bar.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.886
Ah, two.

35:55.888 --> 35:59.356
Oh, my god, no!

35:59.358 --> 36:03.560
Bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

36:20.778 --> 36:22.179
- Look, hurry.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.549
- Get off, me,
I'm trying to get in.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.653
Ah, for fuck's sake.

36:32.524 --> 36:35.192
- Boom!
- Ah, get him, get him.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.776
We've got a big gun now.

37:06.757 --> 37:09.559
Oh, Christ.

37:54.872 --> 37:57.974
- Sorry, I cant
hold it in any longer.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.320
Oh, my gosh.

38:15.793 --> 38:16.726
There.

38:17.762 --> 38:18.695
So,

38:21.032 --> 38:22.632
what's the plan?

38:25.636 --> 38:28.405
- I'd rather you didn't
speak to me when you're,

38:28.407 --> 38:30.607
when you're takin' a shit.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.843
- We need a plan.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.048
- Yeah, well let's not
rush into anythin'.

38:38.050 --> 38:41.318
We've got to have
a real good plan.

38:42.386 --> 38:45.555
- We use that gun and
shoot our way out.

38:47.592 --> 38:50.527
- Look, I don't think running
out of here with guns blazin'

38:50.529 --> 38:51.795
is a good idea.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.097
- We could just

38:55.399 --> 38:56.599
wait for help?

38:58.336 --> 39:00.503
- I don't think I can wait.
- Yeah,

39:00.505 --> 39:01.471
me neither.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.474
- Jeez.
- Sorry.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.443
- Distract my friend
'cause I'm going.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.679
- What about the plan?
- Fuck the plan.

39:14.618 --> 39:15.685
- I'm sorry.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.923
No, wait wait, what's
goin' on, wait.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.559
- Fuck, my partner's out there.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.060
- But my nan's that way.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.962
- Well I don't wanna kill him.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.631
- Well I don't wanna kill her.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.101
- We're goin' that way.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.560
- Did you hear that?
- What?

39:57.562 --> 39:59.829
- Did you hear that?
- What?

40:00.564 --> 40:01.698
- It's jan.

40:02.133 --> 40:02.799
- It's jan.

40:03.434 --> 40:03.933
- Jan who?

40:04.502 --> 40:05.435
- Jan?

40:07.638 --> 40:09.105
- Help me!

40:09.840 --> 40:11.040
- There it is again.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.510
- Shut up, you're
makin' me willies.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.911
- It's comin' from
the livin' room.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.146
- Come on.
- It's my neighbor doin' that,

40:16.148 --> 40:17.547
he may be one.

40:20.017 --> 40:22.152
Wait, man, I don't think
this is a good idea.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.820
- Help me.

40:30.795 --> 40:31.895
- There!

40:42.606 --> 40:43.440
Shoot her.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.921
Why is she so strong?

41:01.659 --> 41:04.594
Shoot her!

41:04.596 --> 41:06.896
Why aren't you shooting her?

41:07.531 --> 41:08.231
Just shoot her!

41:43.033 --> 41:43.967
- Gem.

41:44.702 --> 41:45.835
- Ceri, thank god!

41:46.570 --> 41:47.704
Did you make it out?

41:47.706 --> 41:50.139
- I made it.
- Where are you now?

41:50.141 --> 41:52.175
- Um, not too far away.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.912
I'm at the edge of the woods.

41:59.617 --> 42:00.750
- Ceri?

42:12.296 --> 42:13.997
- I think there's someone here.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.931
- What?

42:17.635 --> 42:19.836
Then get out of the woods.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.038
Get out of the woods, run!

42:24.275 --> 42:25.208
Run!

43:34.144 --> 43:36.312
- I don't think you
should be moving the body.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.914
- I can't have her
lyin' out there.

43:37.916 --> 43:42.051
Any neighbor could pop
out his door and see this.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.755
- She is your neighbor.

43:52.296 --> 43:55.365
I don't wanna take her, what
if a neighbor finds her?

44:01.772 --> 44:02.705
There!

44:05.275 --> 44:06.209
Fuckin'...

44:07.177 --> 44:09.312
I think she's blamin' me.

44:09.813 --> 44:10.246
I,

44:11.749 --> 44:14.317
she could've killed me already.

44:15.019 --> 44:16.285
She still remembers me.

44:16.287 --> 44:17.220
- Come on.

44:17.955 --> 44:19.422
Let's get outta here.

44:31.902 --> 44:34.704
- Fuck!

44:34.706 --> 44:36.939
Didn't see him.

44:36.941 --> 44:38.808
- Conserving bullets.

44:39.410 --> 44:42.311
Good thinking.

44:44.448 --> 44:45.381
Oh, shit.

44:46.316 --> 44:48.351
- What?
- I forgot my club.

44:49.420 --> 44:50.687
Where is he?

44:51.755 --> 44:54.090
Do you think he's
toying with us?

44:54.925 --> 44:56.693
- Zombies don't toy with you.

45:05.302 --> 45:07.070
Clever girl.

45:53.817 --> 45:56.252
- No!

45:56.254 --> 45:58.921
Nan!

45:59.323 --> 46:00.256
Shit!

46:08.966 --> 46:09.899
Nan!

46:54.545 --> 46:55.478
Fuck.

46:56.013 --> 46:56.379
Shit.

47:07.224 --> 47:08.157
Dai.

47:09.259 --> 47:12.195
Things have really
hit the fan here.

47:12.896 --> 47:14.897
- For once you're right.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.500
Don't think it's just
the village any more.

47:17.502 --> 47:20.970
More like the county,
south wales even.

47:22.272 --> 47:26.375
TV and Internet signal's down,
i can't get any outside info.

47:27.444 --> 47:29.178
Luckily the phone
signal's still up.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.447
How's your situation goin'?

47:32.149 --> 47:33.416
- Not too good.

47:34.484 --> 47:37.119
I swear, I've seen
some weird shit.

47:37.955 --> 47:39.255
- Why are you whisperin'?

47:40.224 --> 47:42.024
- I don't know.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.627
- I've noticed a
few different types.

47:44.629 --> 47:48.030
You've got your slow zombie,
normally with white eyes.

47:48.032 --> 47:51.334
Then you've got your
fast zombie, normally
with black eyes.

47:51.336 --> 47:52.635
The supernatural
thing's starting to look

47:52.637 --> 47:54.470
like the right theory, though.

47:54.472 --> 47:58.875
I think they're fastest when
the demon has hold of them.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.477
Need to start thinkin'
about securin' your house

48:01.479 --> 48:03.512
and getting ready
for the long haul.

48:03.514 --> 48:04.981
- What do you mean?

48:04.983 --> 48:06.249
Killin' my nan?

48:07.084 --> 48:08.618
Stockin' up with food, and

48:09.453 --> 48:11.320
and loading up with weapons?

48:15.959 --> 48:18.094
Stockin' up with
food first, I think.

48:18.096 --> 48:19.028
- Okay.

48:19.030 --> 48:20.229
You stock up, kill your nan.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.199
I'm gonna try and get
word from the outside.

48:23.201 --> 48:24.133
Oh!

48:24.434 --> 48:25.167
Hello!

48:25.602 --> 48:26.569
- What?

48:27.638 --> 48:30.273
- Just saw a guy get
his arm ripped off.

48:40.117 --> 48:41.684
Oh, call you later.

49:28.198 --> 49:29.131
- Shit.

49:48.151 --> 49:49.085
Shit.

49:50.420 --> 49:53.222
Shit!

50:17.647 --> 50:20.249
Look you, what are you doin'?

50:35.599 --> 50:36.532
- Shit!

50:43.140 --> 50:45.708
- It's said, the
earlier the zombie,

50:45.710 --> 50:48.377
the more memories it has left.

50:49.246 --> 50:50.413
But soon, they'll all disappear

50:50.415 --> 50:52.048
and all that's left
is its instinct

50:52.050 --> 50:54.250
to eat the livings' flesh.

50:59.823 --> 51:00.589
- Ah, stupid.

51:04.227 --> 51:05.161
Shit.

51:08.131 --> 51:09.065
Fuck.

53:35.345 --> 53:36.278
Oh, fuck!

54:07.711 --> 54:11.480
No, no, oh fuck!

54:55.425 --> 54:56.358
- Ed.

54:56.660 --> 54:57.293
- Phil.

57:27.911 --> 57:28.977
- It's time.

57:38.521 --> 57:39.521
- Dai,

57:40.156 --> 57:42.090
it's getting fucking worse.

57:42.092 --> 57:43.625
- From what I'm seein' here,

57:43.627 --> 57:45.661
you don't wanna leave
your room again.

57:45.663 --> 57:47.663
- Well it's too bloody
late now, I'm on the roof.

57:47.665 --> 57:48.630
- The roof?
- Yeah,

57:48.632 --> 57:50.899
I got chased out my own house.

57:50.901 --> 57:54.069
- You need to get back
in there and secure the house.

57:54.071 --> 57:55.003
- What?

57:55.005 --> 57:57.940
- I'm safe, secure,
I've got plenty of food.

57:57.942 --> 57:59.541
Well, I say food.

58:00.577 --> 58:02.578
A dozen pot noodles,
snacks and tinned stuff.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.513
Should keep me going
for a bit though.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.748
And elen's on the way over.

58:07.951 --> 58:09.952
Hey, how's your girlfriend
taking all this?

58:09.954 --> 58:10.986
- Oh, shit!

58:22.565 --> 58:23.665
Hey, sweetie.

58:24.667 --> 58:25.767
- Don't you hey sweetie
me, you bastard.

58:25.769 --> 58:27.236
Why haven't you called?

58:27.238 --> 58:28.971
- Why didn't you call me?

58:28.973 --> 58:31.106
- Because I'm still
mad at you, that's why.

58:31.108 --> 58:32.708
And just because it's
the end of the world

58:32.710 --> 58:35.143
it doesn't mean I'm
gonna forgive you, okay?

58:35.145 --> 58:36.645
- I'm sorry I didn't
call you sooner, babes,

58:36.647 --> 58:39.214
but my nan's been trying
to kill me all day.

58:39.216 --> 58:41.016
Will you wait a sec?

58:41.618 --> 58:42.584
Where are you?

58:43.119 --> 58:44.520
- I'm in the car.

58:45.555 --> 58:47.890
I'm fine, by the way,
thanks for askin'.

58:48.658 --> 58:49.591
- Fuck!

58:51.661 --> 58:55.731
If you're in your car why
don't you just drive to mine?

58:55.733 --> 58:58.000
- Well, when when i
ran out of the house

58:58.002 --> 59:00.602
I was chased by my uncle rod,

59:01.871 --> 59:04.006
and when I opened the
car door, I panicked, and

59:04.008 --> 59:06.542
I left the keys in the door.

59:07.143 --> 59:09.244
- Your uncle's still there?

59:09.246 --> 59:10.712
- Yeah.

59:12.015 --> 59:13.682
- Okay wait a sec.

59:15.818 --> 59:16.752

59:20.156 --> 59:23.091
I'm sorry I was
so harsh with you.

59:23.660 --> 59:26.762
I wish you was here
to protect me and all.

59:27.063 --> 59:27.829
- Right.

59:28.932 --> 59:30.899
I'm gonna get down
off this roof,

59:30.901 --> 59:32.734

59:32.736 --> 59:36.672
I'm gonna come for you, and
I'm gonna save the fucking day.

59:36.674 --> 59:39.341
- You mean it?
- Yeah, damn right!

59:42.312 --> 59:43.612
- I love you.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.379
- Hiya, love!

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.154

Shit.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:15.557

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:18.260

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:06.308

bitch and my nan's a whore!

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.576
- Oh, shit, Billy, calm down.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:08.944
- And those things have
got me out of the house!

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.846
- It's all right,

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.013
- What the fuck's that?
- A gun.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.348
I found it round
the block, you know.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.517
- Let's have a look.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.586
- What, can I borrow it?
- Oh, no, sorry it's mine.

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:19.955

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:22.224

You're gonna get one.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.124
Where are you?

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:40.808
God, get off.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.787
Oh, god, oh.

Is Gemma here?

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:35.483
I got her a present.

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:40.421

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.494

I'm so sorry, are you all right?

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:07.915

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:13.121

01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:21.429

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.766
- No no, I'll drive.

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.840
Don't do this now,

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.679
Fuck!

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:45.586

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.431

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:57.765
- Come on!

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:58.966
Oh, my god.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:13:59.901

Fuck it, oh god!

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:10.845
Ah, fuck it!

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.880

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:22.457
- Help!

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:57.825
- Is there something
you should be telling us?

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.228
- Yeah, there's
zombies everywhere.

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:01.529
- Everywhere.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:06.634
- Aw, shit.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:08.636
My parents.

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.575
Hey, don't, don't, dad!

Get something sharp!

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:19.747

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:21.849
Oh, he's jumpin' all over him.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.184
- It's a zombie.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.554
You need to destroy its brain!

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.557
Quick!

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:32.793

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.883
- Oh, okay, I'm firin'!

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:59.287

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.024
Get it in the head, man!

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:04.158

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:09.730
Try and move back!

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.265

Get off of him, man.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.951

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.320
Oh!

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:33.754
Oh god!

Get off me, oh fuck, oh.

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:53.808

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.277
- Look, look it's Billy!

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.012

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.259
- What the fuck, Johnny?

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.728
You sick bitch.

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:35.216

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:01.909
Do you have ammo,

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:05.012
Oh, you fucking idiot!

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.782
It's goin' off, Christ almighty.

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.219
Run man and get her!

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:22.263
- Oh, god.
- Get up, get up, get up.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:46.120
- Billy, you're a fucking fool!

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:51.992
- Get out of the way!

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:57.798
Stop the bloody car,
woman, will you do it?

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.994
Jesus!

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.496
- Look,

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:03.464
- Bleeding.

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.471
- No, wait.

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.273
I'll do it.

01:20:57.919 --> 01:20:59.053
- I love you.

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:03.924
- Shit.

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:08.062
- Hey.
- Oh fuck, no.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:09.997
Careful, jeez.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:14.869
Right in the eye.
- Sorry.

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.654
- Don't touch him!

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.154
- So.

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:09.189
You're sayin'

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.525
this all started
with the olds, yeah?

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:13.327
- That's the theory.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:14.595
- But

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:17.197
doesn't your brother work
in an old people's home?

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:18.132
- Yeah.

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:21.135
Oh,
