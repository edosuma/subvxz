00:34.159 --> 00:36.326
In the
spring of 1946,

00:36.411 --> 00:38.787
in the small town
of Texarkana,

00:38.872 --> 00:40.998
on the
Texas-Arkansas border,

00:41.082 --> 00:43.667
a series of horrific murders
were committed

00:43.752 --> 00:47.755
by a masked assailant
known only as
"The Phantom Killer."

00:48.757 --> 00:50.507
For three harrowing months,

00:50.592 --> 00:53.802
the Phantom stalked the
back roads of Texarkana,

00:53.887 --> 00:57.848
following young couples
looking for privacy to
isolated areas,

00:57.932 --> 01:01.685
where their screams
for help would go
unanswered.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.689
Though several arrests
were made in connection
with the brutal slayings,

01:05.774 --> 01:08.025
which ended as suddenly
as they began,

01:08.109 --> 01:11.361
the killer's identity
was never confirmed.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.782
Indeed, many people
who lived through
that nightmare time

01:14.866 --> 01:18.619
believed the Phantom spent
the rest of his days free,

01:18.703 --> 01:20.704
walking the streets
of Texarkana

01:20.789 --> 01:25.375
quietly, anonymously,
until his assumed death.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.837
In 1976, a film inspired
by the infamous

01:28.922 --> 01:31.632
Moonlight Murders
was released.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.885
Every year, on Halloween,
The Town That
Dreaded Sundown

01:34.969 --> 01:38.639
is screened somewhere
in Texarkana,

01:38.723 --> 01:43.894
in tribute to the Phantom's
legacy of death and blood.

01:43.978 --> 01:47.689
Today, Texarkana is a place
haunted by its past,

01:47.774 --> 01:50.818
defined by a mystery
that was never solved,

01:50.902 --> 01:54.238
and a tragedy that
could never be forgotten.

01:54.322 --> 01:58.742
The following happened
in Texarkana last year.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.433
Sammy! Sammy!

02:27.188 --> 02:29.189
You're not enjoying
this, are you?

02:31.025 --> 02:33.527
Oh, I just don't like
these kinds of films
so much.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.864
Why didn't you say so?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.657
We can go.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.952
Really? Do you mean it?

02:47.375 --> 02:48.709
Stop it!

02:57.886 --> 03:01.054
I mean, man, the last time
I saw this movie was
when I was, like, 12.

03:05.393 --> 03:08.103
God bless you
and the Texarkana Fellowship
Church invites you

03:08.188 --> 03:09.855
to stop the Devil
with gospel.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.489
- Hello, sister.
- You take a look at this now.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.826
This is a godless film
that you're watching here.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.121
And I want you to listen
to my broadcast on Friday

03:26.206 --> 03:28.332
and come to church
on Sunday.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.042
I'll tell you
all about it.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.342
Welcome back.
This is KYGL,
Oldies on the Border.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.469
It's Halloween night,
so if you're sitting
at home,

03:40.553 --> 03:42.638
waiting for the
trick-or-treaters
to come by,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.640
we'll keep you company with
our usual bag of tricks.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.517
Real people died,
you know, young man.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.353
Real people died.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.979
That's right.
That's right.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.857
It's a godless film
and I want to see you
on Sunday.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.442
We welcome you.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.781
That's good. You leave.
This is a godless film.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.075
It's good that
you're leavin'.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.649
What?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.654
I'm just having
a good time
with you, Jami.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.520
The only reason I play
football is to get a
scholarship and go to SMU.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.605
Yeah?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.316
And how about you?
Where'd you apply?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.777
Mmm.
You did apply, right?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.279
You're, like,
super smart.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.115
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.951
I applied
to UT Austin,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.536
NYU,

05:30.204 --> 05:31.621
and Cal State.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.956
Wow.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.458
That's impressive.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.210
Oh, I probably won't get in,
but, you know, aim high.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.670
You should.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.469
My dad used to write
for the Gazette, actually.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.763
My grandma says
it's in my blood, so...

05:47.847 --> 05:48.805
Even though no one reads it,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.390
I like writing for the paper.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.475
I could do that from here

05:51.559 --> 05:53.393
and stay close to my grandma.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.811
If I don't get in.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.063
Right.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.236
Well, I'm glad
you finally said yes.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.697
Me, too.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.263
Wait.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.058
What? Did I...
Did I do something wrong?

06:33.893 --> 06:34.935
No.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.066
What the hell
is he doing?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.362
He's just
a Peeping Tom.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.447
He's not gonna
do anything.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.324
Corey,
we don't know that.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.619
But look.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.749
See?
He just wanted a show.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.796
He's just some asshole
from the drive-in.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.594
Let's just go, though.
Is that okay?

07:10.304 --> 07:11.388
Yeah.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.559
Get out of the car.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.185
Don't, Jami.
Stay in the car.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.105
Get out of the fucking car
or I'll shoot her
in the face.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.873
Do your momma and daddy
know where you were
tonight, boy?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.082
The movie.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.500
Yes.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.044
Well, what about yours?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.588
They're dead.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.928
Take your pants off.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.681
What?
Take off your
fucking pants.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.351
Corey, just do it.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.020
Okay, all right.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.398
Come on, man.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.025
Get down on the
fuckin' ground.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.278
Okay.
All right, I am.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.949
I'm not gonna
run anywhere.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.536
Now... Now, please,
can you just let her go?

08:17.872 --> 08:18.914
No.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.207
Please don't kill him.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.876
You.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.128
Turn around.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.880
Do not look back.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.636
All right,
if you want money,

08:33.721 --> 08:34.929
I can get you money.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.640
I don't want money.
What do you want?

08:36.724 --> 08:38.350
I said don't
look back.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.645
What are you doing?
What are...
What are you...

08:42.730 --> 08:44.231
Shut the fuck up!
What are you doin'?

08:44.315 --> 08:46.066
Shut the fuck up.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.651
Shut the fuck up!
What are you doing?

08:47.735 --> 08:49.069
What the fuck
are you doin'...

08:49.654 --> 08:50.820
Corey!

08:52.698 --> 08:54.908
No!
Please, no!
No, please!

08:56.911 --> 08:58.870
Please.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.423
No.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.760
You looked.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.547
This is for Mary.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.382
Make them remember.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.605
What are you doing?
No, please don't hurt me.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.610
- Who is that?
- What?

10:53.694 --> 10:55.612
Oh, no. Please don't hurt me.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.781
- Is she okay?
- Are you okay?

10:59.867 --> 11:02.786
This is
Texarkana 911.
What is your emergency?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.788
We're at the
Twin Star Drive-In.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.374
We need an ambulance
and the police.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.917
Is someone injured?

11:09.001 --> 11:11.795
Yes. Um, a girl and
maybe her boyfriend,
I don't know.

11:11.879 --> 11:12.962
She is hysterical.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.464
All right.
All right.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.967
He was
on top of me.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.304
He could have killed me,
but he didn't.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.139
You say the Phantom
told you something?

11:23.224 --> 11:27.060
I don't know why,
but he said he was doin' it
for someone named Mary.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.814
Were you drinkin'?
Doin' any drugs?

11:30.898 --> 11:34.234
No.
Did the doctors find
any drugs in her?

11:34.318 --> 11:38.405
Well, as a precaution,
we're gonna have someone
in front of your house.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.241
I... I can do that.

11:41.742 --> 11:42.951
Thank you.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.911
Until we get some
more information,

11:44.995 --> 11:51.084
Jami, we'd like to ask you
not to discuss any of this
with the press.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.253
They've been
all over this story,
as you can imagine.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.428
Once again, for those
just joining us,

12:01.512 --> 12:04.013
24 hours after
the shocking

12:04.098 --> 12:07.517
Phantom-inspired murder
of a 17-year-old
high school student,

12:07.601 --> 12:09.686
no arrests have been made.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.271
It is unreasonable

12:11.355 --> 12:13.690
to try and find meaning
in this grotesque

12:13.774 --> 12:15.150
and godless crime,

12:15.234 --> 12:18.653
but that is exactly what
we must do as a community.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.946
Like a lost reel

12:20.030 --> 12:21.823
from The Town That
Dreaded Sundown,

12:21.907 --> 12:25.702
the attack on Halloween night
took place in a secluded,
wooded cul-de-sac,

12:25.786 --> 12:27.370
just off Highway 6,

12:27.455 --> 12:30.290
an area that used to be
called Lovers' Lane.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.889
Grandma, do you remember
anything about the murders?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.224
Oh, dear girl, barely.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.643
Just what
I heard later.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.062
You know,
your great-grandpa

12:53.147 --> 12:56.649
and your great-grandma
lived in this house
when it happened.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.401
I remember my momma
once said

12:58.486 --> 13:00.487
that it was like the town
was being tested

13:00.571 --> 13:02.322
and nobody knew why.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.325
Even the grown-ups
were scared.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.496
He was the bogeyman,
they said.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.332
Can't catch
the bogeyman.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.751
Can't kill the bogeyman.

13:14.835 --> 13:18.087
His father is the devil
and his mother is a whore.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.927
You know,
before that summer,

13:24.011 --> 13:26.846
everybody would leave
their doors unlocked.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.893
And after the summer,
you saw a stranger,

13:31.977 --> 13:33.603
you wouldn't wave hello.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.105
You'd just cross
the street.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.733
And what about when
they made the movie?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.276
What about it?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.362
Were people
still afraid?

13:43.948 --> 13:46.032
The Phantom?
No, that faded.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.369
Nobody knew exactly
who he was

13:50.538 --> 13:51.621
or what he did,

13:51.705 --> 13:54.707
just that he'd
lived in this town

13:54.792 --> 13:58.044
and attacked some
teenagers on
Lovers' Lane.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.466
And then the movie
brought it all back.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.048
This is for Mary.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.642
Humility,
devotion, sacrifice.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.101
Mr. Holland,

16:19.937 --> 16:21.938
I just wanted you
to know that
he was so brave.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.107
You left
my baby boy!

16:24.191 --> 16:25.775
Margaret.
You slut!

16:25.859 --> 16:28.444
Margaret.
You slut! You left him!

16:28.529 --> 16:29.779
It won't bring him back.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.949
You left my
baby boy!
It won't...

16:33.033 --> 16:35.576
I want my baby!

16:35.661 --> 16:37.286
Given what
you've been through,

16:37.371 --> 16:41.916
I'd like to prescribe
a mild anti-anxiety
medication to help you...

16:42.001 --> 16:44.419
No, ma'am.
Um, no, thank you.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.421
I've spent the
last seven years
on all different kinds

16:46.505 --> 16:48.589
of medication after my
parents passed away.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.967
I'm not interested in
anything like that.

16:51.051 --> 16:55.138
In your file I read that
you applied to colleges.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.306
To study, um...

16:57.391 --> 16:59.142
Creative writing.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.144
I'm not sure it's
something I'm ready for,

17:01.228 --> 17:03.146
or made for that,
and leaving town...

17:03.230 --> 17:06.398
I don't want to.
Especially not now.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.279
What about these dreams
you've been having?

17:11.363 --> 17:12.655
What do you think
they're about?

17:13.574 --> 17:15.907
About Corey?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.662
Well,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.665
Corey asked me out
and I was flattered.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.587
I don't get asked out
all that much.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.674
So I just wanted to
show him that...

17:31.759 --> 17:32.842
I...

17:38.599 --> 17:39.807
That I was...

17:39.892 --> 17:40.850
Grateful?

17:40.934 --> 17:42.602
Yeah.

17:44.855 --> 17:49.984
So, when he suggested
that we leave the movie,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.694
I thought we could
go someplace.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.281
And even if we just
kissed for a little while,
he would like me more.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.410
You didn't do anything
wrong, Jami.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.126
He was just
a really good person.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.800
He was just a really good
person and he didn't
deserve that.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.637
He tried to protect me.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.307
Jami.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.728
Try writing
about this.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.814
It might help you
find a way through it.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.872
Baby!

18:55.801 --> 18:57.760
Glad you made it
home safe, baby!

18:59.179 --> 19:03.516
You feel that, baby?
That's for you! Yes!

19:09.857 --> 19:14.235
Oh, baby. I'm sore.
I need a break.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.946
We've got four
in a row for you on KYGL.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.282
There's a machine
by the stairs.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.616
If they got cookies,

19:20.701 --> 19:22.285
get me some cookies.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.287
I need the sugar.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.122
I love you, baby.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.874
I love you, baby.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.305
Hey, knock when
you come back.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.140
So I know it's you.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.095
Help me! Help!

21:06.223 --> 21:07.306
Help!

21:10.227 --> 21:11.310
Help!

21:26.910 --> 21:28.536
No!

21:56.148 --> 21:58.274
Hello?

21:58.358 --> 22:04.488
I'm going to do it
again and again until you
make them remember.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.533
I think I need
to tell someone.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.370
Well, you
just did. Me.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.622
I mean, like a reporter
at the news or something.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.124
He said he was
gonna do it again,

22:15.208 --> 22:18.044
and if he has a message
and he's using me
to get it out,

22:18.128 --> 22:19.795
I have to say
something. It's...

22:19.880 --> 22:24.383
And...
And he's using you why?
'Cause he likes you?

22:27.220 --> 22:28.346
Um...

22:29.681 --> 22:31.724
I don't know.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.687
Miss Lerner,
I promise you

22:37.689 --> 22:39.065
we will
investigate this.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.734
I will personally make sure
that it's investigated.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.403
Thank you.

22:47.574 --> 22:50.910
I just don't understand
why he thinks
we deserve this.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.245
Well,

22:54.414 --> 22:56.290
I'll tell you what,
I wasn't born in
Texarkana,

22:56.375 --> 23:00.002
but I've been around
here long enough
to know one thing.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.421
And that's that
just about everyone
around here

23:02.506 --> 23:04.590
has got some kind of
blood on their hands.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.680
Three weeks
after the shocking death

23:11.765 --> 23:13.349
of high school senior
Corey Holland,

23:13.433 --> 23:16.018
the town of Texarkana
has awoken yet again

23:16.103 --> 23:18.104
to another gruesome
act of violence.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.189
This time, two people
were found dead.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.483
Corporal Daniel Torrens
was coming home

23:22.567 --> 23:25.611
to spend Thanksgiving
with his girlfriend,
Kendra Collins,

23:25.695 --> 23:27.154
when they checked
into this motel...

23:27.239 --> 23:28.697
At a few minutes
past midnight,

23:28.782 --> 23:30.533
the couple was
attacked and killed,

23:30.617 --> 23:33.369
their bodies mutilated
almost beyond recognition.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.538
A heart full of hate,
that'll do it.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.541
A soul consumed
by vengeance. Sin.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.836
The Sheriff's
office has been in contact
with the Texas Rangers

23:41.920 --> 23:43.546
to help with
the investigation.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.549
But in the meantime,
a Town Hall meeting
has been scheduled.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.763
Reverend Cartwright,
will you lead us
in a word of prayer?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.855
Our Dear Heavenly Father,

24:00.939 --> 24:03.399
we ask you to deliver us
through this trial,

24:03.483 --> 24:07.236
shield us during this
time of fire and blood,

24:07.320 --> 24:09.822
of confusion and despair.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.408
We ask you to lend us
some of your strength

24:12.492 --> 24:14.994
and give it to these
fine young men and women

24:15.078 --> 24:16.745
that they may
help guide us

24:16.830 --> 24:19.498
through this forest
of fear and darkness...

24:19.583 --> 24:22.084
This town,
where I was born,

24:22.169 --> 24:25.713
where I grew up, is the
only place I've ever known.

24:25.797 --> 24:26.839
Amen.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.678
The Mayor's asked us
to hold this forum

24:32.762 --> 24:34.889
to give you an update
and hear your concerns.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.348
Well, an update
would be great!

24:36.433 --> 24:38.017
People are saying
the Phantom is back.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.603
That after 60 some years
he's come back and that
we need to be ready.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.438
Ma'am, he'd be
100 years old.

24:42.522 --> 24:46.442
Every time we show
that GD movie, there's
a GD party out there!

24:46.526 --> 24:47.943
The Phantom
is our dirty secret.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.447
That movie will never be
shown in Texarkana again.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.449
Not on the Texas side.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.451
And not on the
Arkansas side, either.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.411
And while you're at it,
why don't you tear down

24:57.496 --> 24:58.621
that statue of Jim Bowie?

24:58.705 --> 25:00.289
Isn't he holding one
of them GD knives?

25:00.373 --> 25:02.124
Why don't you
rip that down?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.792
Everyone knows
some piece of the story,

25:03.877 --> 25:06.045
but the whole truth
has been all but buried.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.964
Oh, we're all so surprised
that the Phantom's back?

25:09.049 --> 25:10.633
Of course he is.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.717
You can't leave a candle

25:11.801 --> 25:13.260
burning in a window
for someone

25:13.345 --> 25:15.554
and then be surprised
when he finally shows up!

25:15.639 --> 25:18.474
Amen. Amen,
sister, Amen.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.560
Most of the people
alive back then
are no longer with us.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.145
Or they just don't
want to remember.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.438
Then you shutter
the bars.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.607
But everything
comes back.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.401
The past is alive,
all around us.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.736
Order!

25:30.820 --> 25:34.240
"Disciples of Evil."
That's what my daddy said.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.633
Hi.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.927
The library's paper
archives only go back
for 10 years.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.845
They said I should
come here if I was
looking for articles

25:56.930 --> 25:58.347
in the Gazette from
the '40s and '50s.

25:58.431 --> 25:59.723
Stuff about the Phantom?

26:00.183 --> 26:01.600
Yes.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.270
Uh, all the best stuff
is upstairs. In the jail.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.908
Listen up!

26:19.953 --> 26:24.206
As of this moment,
the Texas Rangers are in
charge of this investigation.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.666
Specifically, I am.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.044
They moved everything
in here when they
decommissioned the prison.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.046
Now we just
use if for storage.

26:31.131 --> 26:35.467
All of our archives
and files.
It's in here.

26:35.552 --> 26:40.055
Trust me,
I understand how you
feel right now.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.976
I once had a Texas Ranger
come into my house,
and it wasn't easy.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.437
Sparkplug,
give us the room.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.152
Now, let's get down
to business.

26:53.236 --> 26:57.239
I want open, clear lines
of communication between
Texas and Arkansas.

26:57.324 --> 27:01.410
One person from each side
reporting directly to me.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.746
So are you just
casually interested, or...

27:03.830 --> 27:05.914
I don't think we'll
figure out who the
Phantom is now

27:05.999 --> 27:08.917
unless we figure out
who he was back then.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.211
Cool.
We have
two jobs, friends.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.504
To capture this bastard

27:12.589 --> 27:14.757
and to keep the good
people of Texarkana

27:14.841 --> 27:16.383
from killing each other
out of fear.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.219
We are not
huntin' a ghost.

27:19.304 --> 27:23.390
We are after
a flesh and blood,
cold-blooded killer,

27:23.475 --> 27:25.017
who, up to this point,

27:25.101 --> 27:27.561
has not made one mistake.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.563
Due respect, Ranger Morales...

27:29.648 --> 27:30.773
Call me Lone Wolf.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.691
I think very highly
of myself,

27:33.526 --> 27:36.403
and I've also earned it.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.406
Uh, due respect,
Lone Wolf,
he was videotaped.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.283
I'd like to
see that footage.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.243
Oh, and the movie.

27:43.328 --> 27:47.706
Believe it or not, I've
never had the pleasure
of seeing it.

27:47.791 --> 27:52.044
Everything
from 1945 to 1952
is gonna be in here.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.938
You know how that works?
The microfiche?

28:11.022 --> 28:12.773
They were gonna throw
it out, and I said,
"Hey, why?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.400
"You know, it works.
Bring it here."

28:19.739 --> 28:21.240
Well...

28:22.409 --> 28:23.409
Well, thanks.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.247
Yeah. Good luck.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.193
Oh, shit, sorry.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.446
You're Jami Lerner,
aren't you?

29:02.615 --> 29:03.949
I'm Nick.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.870
I went to Evans High
with you.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.372
We were in the same
chem class.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.207
We were?

29:12.292 --> 29:13.876
Yeah, you sat
in the front
to the side.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.627
I sat in the back
to the other side.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.880
And when
I recognized you,
I thought...

29:17.964 --> 29:22.968
"Holy shit, that's her,
and I hope she's okay."

29:25.805 --> 29:30.476
That's all.
I just wanted to
see if you're okay.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.980
Yeah, I am.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.566
Oh, and, uh,
give you this.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.402
It's the greatest hits
the Gazette published back
when it was happening.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.404
And then they did
a retrospective.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.072
It's usually $12
for xeroxing, but you can...

29:44.157 --> 29:46.158
Don't worry about it.
Just go ahead.

29:48.411 --> 29:49.453
Thanks.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.248
Well, I'll just be
downstairs,
manning the desk,

29:53.333 --> 29:54.833
if you need anything.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.638
From the KYGL
on the Border family

30:49.722 --> 30:52.224
to your family,
stay safe out there.

30:52.308 --> 30:55.978
If you do go out,
go out in a group,
and don't play hero.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.647
You see someone
that looks suspicious
comin' your way,

30:58.731 --> 31:00.899
cross to the other side
of the street, will you?

31:43.860 --> 31:45.819
Oh, my God.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.779
"They couldn't catch me
66 years ago

31:47.864 --> 31:49.323
"and they never will.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.199
"I come and go as I please.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.035
"I kill when I please.

31:53.119 --> 31:56.288
"You may think I'm
a horrible, sick murderer,

31:56.789 --> 31:58.457
"but I'm not.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.334
"I love my neighbors.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.171
"I wish they would stop
and let my soul
rest in peace."

32:04.255 --> 32:06.381
"For you see,
I am the soul of Texarkana.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.717
"I am the reckoning
foretold."

32:10.803 --> 32:13.305
Oh, look,
I can understand how
this can be upsetting,

32:13.389 --> 32:16.725
but it's also
most likely a fake.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.810
Well, the Zodiac,
he sent a manifesto
to the press and...

32:18.895 --> 32:20.854
Yes. And so did
the Son of Sam,

32:20.939 --> 32:22.731
and the Axeman
of New Orleans,

32:22.815 --> 32:25.400
but to reporters,
not teenagers.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.861
We all realize it could
be a hoax, Deputy.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.905
But until it's
100% confirmed,

32:29.989 --> 32:32.991
we will take it
and this young lady
seriously.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.369
I want my entire team
to hear what
you have to say.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.288
If you think
it's important,
we think it's important.

32:39.499 --> 32:40.832
Well, um...

32:42.001 --> 32:43.669
I've been researching
the original case,

32:43.753 --> 32:45.921
and going through
the court transcripts.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.881
Do you know who
Benjamin Sewell is?

32:47.966 --> 32:51.259
He was a car thief,
arrested in 1946
in Texarkana

32:51.344 --> 32:53.095
for possession of
a stolen automobile.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.597
A lot of people
think that he was
the Phantom because...

32:55.682 --> 32:57.182
Well, the killing stopped
once he was arrested.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.059
How long was he in for?

32:59.143 --> 33:00.936
- Thirty years.
- Thirty years.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.106
And then
Benjamin Sewell died,
Ms. Lerner.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.024
Yes, sir.
He died last summer.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.609
In a hospital
in Fort Worth.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.278
I spoke to a nurse
that worked at the hospital,

33:10.363 --> 33:11.947
um, since before
Benjamin died...

33:12.031 --> 33:13.448
Now, come on,
we don't have
time for this.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.784
Hold on.
She said a young man
used to visit him.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.411
His son, they thought.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.121
What if it's him?

33:19.205 --> 33:20.872
That the passing of his
father set him off

33:20.957 --> 33:23.166
and he came back here
to finish his father's work?

33:25.378 --> 33:27.921
Benjamin Sewell did
have a son, Ms. Lerner,

33:28.006 --> 33:31.049
but he died
in a bar fight
two years ago.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.010
He did?

33:33.553 --> 33:34.970
It's all right, Jami.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.055
We went down that
same rabbit hole.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.977
This is KYGL,

33:42.061 --> 33:44.271
Oldies on the Border,
and if you've got us on,

33:44.355 --> 33:47.149
you're probably getting
ready for the big football
game this weekend.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.819
The Texas High Tigers
versus the Arkansas
High Razorbacks.

33:50.903 --> 33:53.155
It's gonna be
a blood match, folks.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.489
But as always...

34:00.747 --> 34:02.831
He said he'd shoot me
if I got any closer.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.708
Well, that's
his job.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.210
How'd it go
at the station?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.338
Uh, not so well.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.965
It's no surprise.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.176
Grandma, this is...
Nick Strain.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.261
I went to the same
high school as Jami.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.846
Hmm. And now?

34:17.929 --> 34:20.014
I work at the archives.
Uh, researcher.

34:20.099 --> 34:23.185
I found you some really
cool stuff from back when
they were making the movie.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.145
You know,
some of those people
are still around. So...

34:25.228 --> 34:26.813
Uh, no college, huh?

34:26.898 --> 34:28.440
Just making
some money first.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.775
Family?
Grandma.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.695
My parents moved to
Denton last year,

34:33.780 --> 34:35.655
so I'm living with
some buddies.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.282
I'll be in
in a minute, okay?

34:37.366 --> 34:38.699
All right.

34:43.121 --> 34:44.539
Sorry about that.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.541
You want to sit down?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.710
You know, they did
tons of research
for the movie.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.378
The director and his son.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.301
Thanks for
bringing me
this stuff.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.220
Yeah.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.306
Can I ask why
you're helping me
with all this?

35:04.310 --> 35:06.269
I always wanted to
talk to you.

35:10.983 --> 35:11.983
Why didn't you?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.154
Didn't think I'd get very far.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.741
I never saw you with a...

35:19.826 --> 35:23.078
Boyfriend or friends or...
I asked around and...

35:23.162 --> 35:24.788
I was like,
"What's her story?"

35:25.998 --> 35:27.874
Then someone
told me about...

35:27.959 --> 35:29.584
About my parents?

35:29.669 --> 35:33.755
Or that for the last
seven years I've been
totally out of it and...

35:33.840 --> 35:34.923
Both.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.345
My parents didn't
really move to Denton.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.597
I just said that 'cause

35:44.100 --> 35:47.352
I didn't want your
grandma to think I was
this, you know,

35:48.437 --> 35:49.437
basket case.

35:51.190 --> 35:53.150
Which, of course,
now I really seem
like one.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.111
Where are they?

35:56.195 --> 35:58.780
Well, my dad killed
himself last year.

36:00.950 --> 36:04.202
He was an, um, an alcoholic,

36:06.873 --> 36:08.874
and my mom, uh, kinda...

36:11.377 --> 36:13.295
She just got lost after that.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.882
Um, she's at Trans-Allegheny.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.050
Well, it's a loony bin.

36:21.888 --> 36:26.433
Oh, hey, um,
they're having a vigil
tonight at the school.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.519
For the soldier
and his girlfriend.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.315
And for Corey.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.693
You wanna go?

36:43.576 --> 36:45.785
You don't
mean that fellow they call
the Lone Wolf

36:45.870 --> 36:48.163
- of the Texas Rangers?
- That's right.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.457
Hmm.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.417
Since I'm in charge
of this investigation,

36:52.501 --> 36:54.669
things are gonna have
to be handled my way.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.796
We got a cold-blooded
killer here.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.423
A man who nobody sees.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.592
A Phantom who

37:00.676 --> 37:02.344
so far hasn't made
any mistakes.

37:09.727 --> 37:10.852
What are you doing?

37:10.937 --> 37:12.437
No, please,
don't hurt me.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.189
Please.

37:16.859 --> 37:20.445
I guess it was crazy
of me to think I could
help the police,

37:20.529 --> 37:22.113
but I'm gonna
keep researching.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.532
Keep writing.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.368
Their stories need
to be told, so...

38:50.870 --> 38:52.537
Arrest me.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.289
- Arrest me!
- On the ground!

38:54.373 --> 38:57.208
He killed Danny.
But I got him.
I got his ass!

39:03.132 --> 39:05.467
- Jami.
- No! No, Nick...

39:05.551 --> 39:07.052
Wait! No! I need to know!

39:44.757 --> 39:46.549
Excuse me.
May I, please?

39:50.221 --> 39:53.264
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sheriff Underwood has
just informed me

39:53.349 --> 39:55.183
that the man who killed
Corey Holland,

39:55.267 --> 39:58.311
the man who killed,
viciously, that couple,

39:58.396 --> 39:59.896
that man has been shot,
I'm told.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.482
And I don't know
what his condition is,

40:02.566 --> 40:05.026
but I do know that
no one else was hurt.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.530
And that that, finally,
is something that
we can give thanks for.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.700
Reverend Cartwright,

40:12.785 --> 40:17.163
would you please lead us in
a brief prayer of gratitude?

40:17.248 --> 40:20.208
Sweet Heavenly Father,
we have been delivered.

40:20.292 --> 40:23.670
We praise the men
and women who have led us
through this darkness.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.548
Sweet Jesus, thank you
for your mercy.

40:26.632 --> 40:28.508
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.802
Now, we've had
a quiet night here.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.471
But I do believe
that it would be
appropriate

40:33.556 --> 40:35.890
for us to have a little
music that we could
dance to,

40:35.975 --> 40:39.060
so, gentlemen,
I'm gonna lead you off.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.478
One, two...

40:40.563 --> 40:41.855
One, two, three, four.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.078
What was she doing?

40:57.163 --> 40:58.455
"A one..."

40:59.165 --> 41:00.582
The worst dance
moves ever.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.086
Straight home now.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.754
Yes, sir.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.018
It's right here.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.781
Remember when we
used to come over here

41:33.866 --> 41:35.200
and smoke cigarettes?

41:36.035 --> 41:38.286
Thought we were
such hot shit.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.225
So...

42:03.896 --> 42:05.730
So how does this work?

42:07.066 --> 42:08.566
I don't know.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.319
I thought maybe
you could...

42:11.904 --> 42:13.238
You know.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.073
What?

42:16.158 --> 42:18.034
You know.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.496
Go down there,

42:23.374 --> 42:24.749
and suck it.

42:25.251 --> 42:26.251
Suck it?

42:27.253 --> 42:28.920
I don't know.
Maybe a little?

42:30.047 --> 42:31.506
What, is it hard?

42:31.590 --> 42:33.758
Yeah.
Isn't yours?

42:34.593 --> 42:35.677
Yeah.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.057
You first.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.268
And then I'll do you.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.270
Maybe we could

42:45.938 --> 42:47.105
jerk off together.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.275
Dude, drive!

42:50.359 --> 42:51.609
Come on!
Hurry up, come on!

43:55.341 --> 43:57.342
Run, Johnny! Run!

43:59.678 --> 44:00.678
No!

44:57.236 --> 44:58.319
Hi.

44:59.988 --> 45:01.906
Who was that guy
at the vigil?

45:01.990 --> 45:03.491
Name's Paul Mason.

45:03.575 --> 45:06.077
A freshman over at
Texarkana College.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.496
He's a messed up
kid but...

45:08.580 --> 45:10.498
He's not the Phantom?
No.

45:10.582 --> 45:14.335
Some stupid teenager
went out looking to
get shot.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.421
Left a suicide note
in his dorm room.

45:18.424 --> 45:19.757
But just because
he wanted to die

45:19.842 --> 45:21.843
doesn't necessarily
mean he's not the
Phantom, right?

45:21.927 --> 45:23.177
Hell, Jami...

45:29.935 --> 45:32.353
I... I did not want
to tell you this

45:32.438 --> 45:33.938
but you're...

45:35.274 --> 45:36.983
There was another
murder last night.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.693
It was two boys.

45:38.777 --> 45:40.695
We're checking security
cameras at the scene,

45:40.779 --> 45:43.906
but it does look like
it happened after
Paul Mason was shot.

45:50.414 --> 45:54.542
It was Sunday,
March 3rd, 1946.

45:54.626 --> 45:58.045
The beginning of a reign
of terror for the people
of Texarkana

45:58.130 --> 46:01.466
and surrounding areas
of Arkansas and Texas.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.802
Well, that's the most
god-awful thing I've done
in a long while.

46:06.388 --> 46:08.389
They asked me if their...

46:08.724 --> 46:11.184
Their sons

46:11.268 --> 46:14.103
were dead before
he mutilated their bodies.

46:14.813 --> 46:16.481
I lied.

46:17.649 --> 46:21.194
I, uh, told 'em
as far as I could tell,

46:21.278 --> 46:23.321
they had passed
before the worst of it.

46:24.072 --> 46:25.323
Maybe they had.

46:26.116 --> 46:28.075
They cried.

46:28.160 --> 46:33.164
These two grown men,
I've known 'em
all their lives.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.502
Since they were boys.

46:37.586 --> 46:40.797
We catch him, we kill him,
that'll make it better.

46:42.841 --> 46:44.926
That'll at least
bring them peace.

46:45.010 --> 46:46.093
I agree.

46:46.512 --> 46:47.970
To that end,

46:49.681 --> 46:52.934
after our friend kills those
kids with the trombone,

46:54.186 --> 46:56.229
who does he
go after next?

46:56.313 --> 46:58.231
In the movie, after
the trombone killin',

46:58.315 --> 47:01.567
there's a double homicide
at the farmhouse.

47:01.652 --> 47:04.362
Every damn house
out here is a farmhouse.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.365
Texarkana looked normal

47:07.449 --> 47:11.035
in the daylight hours
but everyone dreaded
sundown.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.623
Maybe I was
wrong, Nick.

47:15.707 --> 47:17.375
Maybe there is no
connection to the past

47:17.459 --> 47:20.628
and the Phantom is
just the bogeyman.

47:21.213 --> 47:24.131
Like my grandma says.

47:24.216 --> 47:27.301
The first time I heard
about the Phantom,
I was eight years old.

47:27.386 --> 47:30.221
I was at a sleepover at
my friend Chrissie's house.

47:39.648 --> 47:42.400
I called my parents
to come pick me up.

47:46.154 --> 47:48.072
And that was the night
of the crash.

47:56.748 --> 48:00.751
That night in the woods,
he was on top of me

48:01.587 --> 48:03.713
and I thought,
"This is it."

48:05.674 --> 48:07.633
You know, it should have
happened when I was
eight years old.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.552
It's finally
caught up to me now.

48:11.263 --> 48:13.097
Death.

48:13.181 --> 48:16.267
It's following me
and it's only
a matter of time.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.771
I guess I'm a little
messed up.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.023
I don't think you are.

48:22.107 --> 48:24.734
Well, yeah, that's just
'cause you are, too.
Good.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.198
Nick, what are
you doing?
It's okay.

48:31.283 --> 48:32.617
No, it's not okay!

48:33.410 --> 48:34.368
I thought that...

48:34.453 --> 48:35.786
I can't believe
you just did that.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.206
Look, I'm sorry,
I just thought that
we had this...

48:39.291 --> 48:41.375
I need you to get out
of the car right now.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.629
Nick, I mean it!
Get out of the car!

48:47.466 --> 48:49.800
Are you serious?

49:11.657 --> 49:13.491
Oh, that looks just fine.

49:13.575 --> 49:15.576
Mmm-hmm.
That's very nice.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.036
You got everything now,
the scallops?
Yes.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.496
The potatoes
and the ham?

49:20.332 --> 49:21.582
Ranger.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.501
Hank.

49:23.585 --> 49:25.461
Well, Merry Christmas.

49:26.838 --> 49:28.631
Merry Christmas,
Reverend.
Merry Christmas, Joe.

49:29.508 --> 49:31.425
Well, what can I do
for you gentlemen?

49:31.510 --> 49:34.804
Is there a place
the three of us can
go and talk, Joe?

49:37.599 --> 49:39.100
Mmm-hmm.

49:41.853 --> 49:43.938
I didn't send
this e-mail.

49:45.607 --> 49:48.609
Well, the FBI traced it
back to you, Joe, so...

49:49.861 --> 49:50.861
Why'd you send it
to the girl?

49:50.946 --> 49:52.363
To muddy up the waters?

49:52.447 --> 49:54.949
I don't know
what to tell you.

49:55.033 --> 49:57.952
Here's what I think.
I don't think you
killed anybody.

49:58.036 --> 50:00.663
But I do believe
you sent this message.

50:02.708 --> 50:06.293
See, I hear you
at night, preachin'.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.796
Nothin' much for me
to do in my hotel room,

50:08.880 --> 50:11.716
so I wonder,
"Are you doing this
for publicity, or..."

50:11.800 --> 50:15.469
He chose that girl
to be his herald.

50:15.554 --> 50:19.974
His messenger.
He is doing
the Lord's work.

50:20.058 --> 50:21.976
He's killin'
our kids, Joe.

50:22.060 --> 50:26.313
My church is
more full than it
has been in years.

50:26.398 --> 50:30.234
People are coming to me
asking for redemption,
for salvation.

50:30.902 --> 50:32.903
They're scared, Hank.

50:32.988 --> 50:35.573
They want to walk
on the righteous
path again.

50:36.908 --> 50:38.701
Now, I want to call
the Mayor.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.079
And then I want
to call my lawyer.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.587
Merry Christmas, ma'am.

50:50.255 --> 50:51.839
Merry Christmas.

50:51.923 --> 50:54.050
I was wondering
if Jami's around?

50:57.429 --> 50:59.221
He's kidding, right?

51:05.604 --> 51:07.605
I'm sorry about
what I did.

51:07.689 --> 51:10.775
No, I'm sorry.
I can't believe
I made you walk home.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.694
I took the bus.

51:19.618 --> 51:21.994
Hey, I wanted to tell you.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.997
I found out
Charles Pierce, Jr.
is alive.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.832
He's the son of
the director of
The Town...

51:26.917 --> 51:28.375
The Town
That Dreaded Sundown?

51:28.460 --> 51:31.212
Look, I know it's
a long shot, but...

51:31.296 --> 51:33.380
I mean, the movie,
uh, defined Texarkana

51:33.465 --> 51:36.217
just as much as
the murders did.

51:36.301 --> 51:38.719
Anyway, he lives here,
in Texarkana.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.888
Near here,
out by the dredge.

51:41.389 --> 51:42.640
You talked to him?

51:42.724 --> 51:44.725
Uh, no, I've been
asking around about him.

51:44.810 --> 51:47.228
He does odd jobs
for the city, doesn't even
have a cell phone.

51:47.312 --> 51:49.563
But worth a try. Right?

51:49.648 --> 51:51.232
If I can get
in touch with him?

51:51.316 --> 51:52.983
Yeah, definitely.

51:54.319 --> 51:55.820
Thanks.
All right.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.324
This is for you.

52:03.286 --> 52:04.328
Nick.

52:29.855 --> 52:31.188
Thank you.

52:33.608 --> 52:35.734
This one's for all
the brave men and women

52:35.819 --> 52:38.571
who are out there
each and every night
patrolling the streets,

52:38.655 --> 52:39.947
doing everything
they can...

52:40.031 --> 52:42.741
We do not, and I repeat,
we do not believe

52:42.826 --> 52:44.952
that Reverend Cartwright
is the Phantom.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.788
We have taken
Reverend Joseph Cartwright
into custody...

52:47.873 --> 52:50.207
Get me started, Elmer.

52:54.963 --> 52:56.881
Every Christmas,
Ardele.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.134
They don't have you
working tonight?

53:02.179 --> 53:03.971
Well, I just arrested

53:04.055 --> 53:05.306
one of Texarkana's

53:05.390 --> 53:07.308
most prominent citizens

53:07.392 --> 53:09.518
for sending an e-mail, so...

53:11.396 --> 53:12.563
That's enough
for tonight.

53:14.149 --> 53:16.400
We do not have
the Phantom in custody.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.214
Hank.

54:20.298 --> 54:21.298
Hank!

56:20.919 --> 56:22.211
Mark it.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.173
Action. Bud.

56:32.931 --> 56:36.141
My daddy was
a genius visionary.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.937
Could have been
the next Orson Welles
if he'd gone to Hollywood,

56:40.021 --> 56:44.858
but he wanted to stay in Texas
and tell our stories.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.110
You know,
Texas stories.

56:47.070 --> 56:49.196
Not all that
Hollywood bullshit.

56:51.449 --> 56:53.784
Oh, that. Yeah,
that's pretty cool.

56:54.452 --> 56:56.036
Yep. That's the original.

56:57.789 --> 56:59.331
Go ahead and touch it
if you want.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.208
No, thank you, sir.
Go ahead.

57:02.127 --> 57:03.877
That's okay. I don't...
I don't want to.

57:03.962 --> 57:05.129
Okay.

57:09.717 --> 57:13.554
Um... Mr. Pierce,
I'm writing something
about the Phantom,

57:13.638 --> 57:15.514
about his legacy
in our town and...

57:15.598 --> 57:17.391
Well, I can tell you
who the killer is.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.893
Would that be
interesting to you?

57:20.728 --> 57:21.728
Sure, yeah.

57:21.813 --> 57:24.356
Well, all right.

57:24.441 --> 57:30.237
Well, my father, when
he was doing his research,
he talked to everyone.

57:30.321 --> 57:33.532
Most people believe
that Benjamin Sewell
was the Phantom.

57:33.616 --> 57:35.576
No, he wasn't.
No, no, no, no.

57:35.660 --> 57:36.743
Sewell was not
the killer.

57:36.828 --> 57:38.579
No, they railroaded
that poor son of a bitch.

57:38.663 --> 57:40.497
No, the police just
wanted someone
to be the killer.

57:41.416 --> 57:42.583
How do you know
that for sure?

57:42.667 --> 57:44.460
How do I know?
I don't know.

57:45.420 --> 57:46.962
You can't know.

57:48.965 --> 57:50.883
Oh.

57:50.967 --> 57:56.013
You know, I'll tell you
a story that my
father told me

57:56.097 --> 57:57.598
about Hank McCreedy.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.099
Hank McCreedy?

57:59.184 --> 58:03.604
A few days after
the last murder
at the Stark farm,

58:03.688 --> 58:05.939
the police on
the Arkansas side,

58:06.024 --> 58:09.443
they found a body
all in pieces.

58:12.030 --> 58:14.448
It'd been run over
by a train.

58:14.532 --> 58:15.949
Now, this is
the Arkansas police

58:16.034 --> 58:17.784
who say,
"Oh, it's the Phantom.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.244
"He committed suicide."

58:19.329 --> 58:20.871
No more Phantom.

58:20.955 --> 58:21.955
Based on what?

58:22.040 --> 58:24.791
Nothin'.
It was based on nothin'.

58:24.876 --> 58:28.378
But Hank McCreedy's
pregnant wife,

58:28.463 --> 58:30.297
she demands
an autopsy.

58:30.381 --> 58:32.633
And then it come out.
He wasn't run over.

58:32.717 --> 58:35.302
He was stabbed
more than two dozen times,

58:35.386 --> 58:36.678
right next to
the tracks.

58:38.223 --> 58:41.475
My daddy, he had
a theory about that.

58:41.559 --> 58:45.312
He said that the Phantom
killed McCreedy,

58:45.396 --> 58:49.191
you know, his last victim,
his final goodbye.

58:50.735 --> 58:53.654
And then he hopped
a train to California.

58:53.738 --> 58:56.823
Mr. Pierce, I've read
everything there is
to read on this.

58:56.908 --> 58:58.825
I've never even heard
of this Hank McCreedy.

58:58.910 --> 59:00.327
It should have been
front-page news.

59:00.411 --> 59:04.164
But while the Arkansas
police were findin' McCreedy,

59:04.249 --> 59:07.834
the Texas police,
they were arresting Sewell

59:07.919 --> 59:09.670
and so you got
two different camps

59:09.754 --> 59:10.963
each saying
they got the Phantom.

59:11.047 --> 59:13.340
And what neither of them
is piecing together is that

59:13.424 --> 59:16.343
Sewell was in custody
when McCreedy was killed,

59:16.427 --> 59:18.095
proving that neither
one was the Phantom.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.974
So Sewell was in jail,

59:22.058 --> 59:24.101
and then, did anything
ever come from McCreedy?

59:24.185 --> 59:25.686
Oh, he's dead.

59:27.063 --> 59:28.772
Yep, and dead men
don't complain much.

59:28.856 --> 59:30.691
But his pregnant
wife, Mary,

59:30.775 --> 59:31.858
she's pissed as shit.

59:31.943 --> 59:33.193
Her name was Mary?

59:33.278 --> 59:36.029
My daddy tracked
her down in 1974.

59:36.114 --> 59:38.365
And, oh, she was
still bitter.

59:38.449 --> 59:40.534
She said that Texarkana

59:40.618 --> 59:42.661
had done worse than
killed her husband.

59:42.745 --> 59:44.538
It had shat
on his memory.

59:44.622 --> 59:47.165
And in the process, it was
shitting on her life.

59:47.250 --> 59:48.875
It was shitting on
her son's life.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.712
Who you think
is the Phantom?

59:51.796 --> 59:53.297
No! No!

59:55.133 --> 59:56.133
Sorry.

59:57.218 --> 59:59.219
Hank McCreedy's dead.

59:59.304 --> 01:00:01.638
His son is dead.
His grandson

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.724
is still alive.

01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:05.809
That's your Phantom,
right there.

01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:06.893
You're making
this shit up.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:08.562
No! Boy, listen to me.

01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:11.732
I am telling you what
I know to be true.

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:15.068
That Mary McCreedy
did pour poison
about Texarkana

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:16.695
into Hank Jr.'s ear.

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.572
Hank did the same
thing to his son!

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:20.407
They did, consciously
or unconsciously,

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:22.326
they bred themselves
a killer!

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:27.664
Mr. Pierce,
do you have any proof
of this being true,

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.000
or is this just something
that your father told you?

01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:44.514
My daddy asked me to make
a sequel to Town,

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.560
to finish the story
he started

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.854
and to set the record straight
about the McCreedys.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.195
He was my best friend.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:02.032
Now he's deceased.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.080
I tracked down
Mary McCreedy in 1986.

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.540
I found that
scary old bitch
on her deathbed,

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:12.626
and she warned me.

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:15.962
She said that her
grandson would do

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.465
what her son didn't have
the balls to do.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:22.886
Make Texarkana
pay for its sins.

01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:27.974
Yeah. And no one else
has thought of this?

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.477
Not like the police,
or the FBI,

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:32.813
or the goddamn fucking
Texas Rangers?

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.356
Do you believe
his story?

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.860
Are you kidding me?
The man lives on a boat.

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.988
Wait, do you
believe him?

01:01:43.574 --> 01:01:44.700
I don't know.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.495
Hey, I'm just saying,

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.622
if McCreedy did
have a grandson,

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:54.167
he'd probably be in
his 20s or his 30s,
at least. Nick.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.669
Come on.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:14.688
As far as we know, fucking
Charles B. Pierce, Jr.
could be the killer.

01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:16.356
He doesn't have
a reason to be.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:19.526
His story was told,
his father's story
was told.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:20.986
Yeah, up until the sequel.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.654
But they're a part
of the legend.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.489
They're in the movie.
They're there somewhere.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.615
All of them except for...

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.284
McCreedy.

01:02:27.368 --> 01:02:30.203
Now, his name
wasn't even mentioned
in the papers.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:32.164
He doesn't have
a plaque anywhere.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:35.000
He's not even in
the movie that they
show every damn year.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.210
It's...
It'd be upsetting.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:38.962
It's an injustice, Nick.

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:42.424
Hank McCreedy's grandson would
see it as an injustice.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:51.099
Now, this is a very sad day

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:53.143
for us all.

01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:56.563
It always is when you lose
an officer of the law

01:02:56.647 --> 01:02:58.648
in the line of duty.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:02.235
Now, I did not work with
Deputy Tillman long,

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.238
but you all know him
a lot better than...

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.574
How many of these
have you gotten?

01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:10.243
This is the second
notice of acceptance.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.912
Grandma, I just
met somebody
and I think I might...

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:14.247
I am not gonna let this mess

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.333
be the most important
thing in your life.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.085
Grandma, it already is.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.254
I have talked to your
uncle in California

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:24.174
and he said that we can stay
with him as long as need be.

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:26.176
Pack up.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.596
We'll leave
before daybreak.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:09.386
Tomorrow for sure?

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:13.056
I'm already packed.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:15.892
You couldn't
wait a day?

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.159
I'm not gonna see you.

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.203
I hate that.

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.249
I could come visit,
though.

01:04:42.086 --> 01:04:43.378
Yeah, of course.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.941
Are you okay?

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:48.944
Yeah.

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.966
Grandma.
I'll just be a second.
Okay.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.846
So, I'm not sure
if anyone told you,

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.890
but my grandma
and I are gonna take off
for a little while.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.310
Yeah, she mentioned that.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:29.895
Can I show
you something?

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:33.149
It could be nothing,
but I just think it should be
investigated by someone.

01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:40.740
Who's he?
His name's
Hank McCreedy.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.908
He was the original
Phantom's last victim

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:45.036
but he's sort of
forgotten about.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.703
I heard a story
about him, so I did
some research,

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.747
and he's got a grandson
somewhere.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.582
I've been writing
an article.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:51.835
I'm gonna try
and finish it

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:53.377
when I get
to California.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.671
I'll look into it
for you, I promise.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:58.006
Jami. Come on, hon.

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:02.804
Drive safe.

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:29.163
Never left Texas
my whole life.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.501
Isn't that somethin'?

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:56.816
Do you want
anything else?
Just a coffee?

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.276
Mmm... A Danish.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.320
And, uh, get some water.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.000
Good morning.
It's New Year's Day
here at KYGL,

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:16.669
and for you early birds,
here's a classic.

01:11:18.148 --> 01:11:19.649
Grandma?

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.986
Grandma.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.664
Grandma, no!

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.126
No...  No!

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:40.044
Don't...

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.921
Help me, please,
somebody!

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.228
The Phantom, he's...

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:04.647
Like a dog with a bone,
ain't ya?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.532
What?

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:13.716
Oh, my God.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.636
Oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, no, no!

01:15:23.393 --> 01:15:24.644
The fuck...

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:41.702
Foster.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.086
Go on, show her, boy.

01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:56.676
No!

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.760
Hey, Jami.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.679
No!

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:01.931
No!

01:16:02.766 --> 01:16:05.685
No! I saw him die!

01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:07.687
I watched you die!
Shh!

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:09.021
I know...
If you remember,

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:11.357
you actually missed
most of it.

01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:14.193
They found his body.
They found his body.

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.112
No, I found his body.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.365
Was a poor runaway kid.

01:16:19.449 --> 01:16:22.702
Cut up his face,
knocked out his teeth,
left two of mine.

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:26.706
Are you Hank McCreedy's
grandson?

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.374
One of you is
Hank McCreedy's grandson.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.792
I am.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:34.297
And now, thanks to you,

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:37.967
they're gonna remember
my granddaddy.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.345
Corey.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:45.641
All those people died.
My grandma.
Why did you do it?

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.812
Born in Texarkana,

01:16:50.814 --> 01:16:52.565
buried in Texarkana.

01:16:56.069 --> 01:16:57.987
Well, not me,
God damn it.

01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:01.741
But I knew we were
the same, you and me.

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:03.326
Both of us trapped.
No.

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:05.578
We are not the same.

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:08.164
Didn't this town
decide who you were?

01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:11.584
The crazy girl, with the...
The dead parents?

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:14.420
Oh, it was
the same with me.

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:17.673
I was the golden boy.
A football star.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:19.925
I'd go to college
like my dad

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.011
and I'd come back
like my dad.

01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:23.679
Well, fuck that!

01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:26.932
I wanted to be a part of
something special.

01:17:27.017 --> 01:17:28.517
I wanted to be
remembered!

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:30.102
Like the Phantom.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.938
When people talk about
what happened in Texarkana,

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:35.399
about how the Phantom
came back,

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.109
oh, I'll know!

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.695
I'll know that I,
I made that...

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.618
They're gonna keep
looking for you.

01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:47.286
They're gonna keep
looking for the...
Jami!

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.421
Why would they?

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.714
No!

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.716
When I tell 'em

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.052
that I caught
the two kids who did it.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:04.887
Who were so obsessed

01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.305
with the Phantom,

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.307
that one faked
his own death.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.226
She killed her
own grandma.

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.228
No! No, fuck you!
And you know what?

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.481
They'll believe me.

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:16.691
Only because

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.486
everybody in this town

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.405
just wants to believe
this whole thing is over.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:42.675
It is over.

01:19:10.787 --> 01:19:12.872
This story
is about Texarkana.

01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:15.291
A town that is
really two towns.

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:17.376
Two sheriffs. Two mayors.

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:19.587
And in the end,
two Phantoms.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:23.382
After I came out of the
Redwater Bayous that night,

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:26.051
Ranger Morales
and his men went back in.

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:29.638
They wanted to close
the most terrible chapter
in our town's history.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.685
Some people say the swamp
took Deputy Foster,

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:38.063
that the swamp gave him
the only burial he deserved.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.732
Others believed I hadn't
killed the Phantom

01:19:39.816 --> 01:19:42.026
'cause he was something
that couldn't be killed.

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.195
A demon or a spirit.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.322
People believe what
they need to believe.

01:19:46.406 --> 01:19:49.241
They make up whatever
story they need to
keep living sanely.

01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:50.701
Well, I did the Bootleggers,

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.036
and The Legend
of Boggy Creek

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.913
and this is my third one,
Winterhawk.

01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:56.707
The hardest thing
for my town has been
the wrestling to understand

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.043
how Clayborn Foster
and Corey found each other

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.503
and put on those masks

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.256
and did those inhuman things.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.551
Their lives were
investigated and there was
nothing linking them.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:11.388
They had nothing in common
except the darkness
in their souls.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:14.683
And I swear, that will
keep the Phantom alive
as much as anything else.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.603
As for me,

01:20:17.687 --> 01:20:19.688
I did what my grandma
always wanted.

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:24.151
I left Texas.
I moved away.

01:20:25.445 --> 01:20:27.446
To a new life,

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:30.366
to a place where no one
knows who I am,
or what I survived.

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:33.118
Where I'm the only
person that knows

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:35.079
that as quickly
and as senselessly

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:38.290
as death came to
Texarkana in 1946,

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.543
and then again
late last year,

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.962
it could come back

01:20:43.046 --> 01:20:45.339
the next time
the sun goes down.
