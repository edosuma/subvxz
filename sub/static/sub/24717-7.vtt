00:04.241 --> 00:05.840
RAMY ROMANY:
Welcome to Egypt, Giorgio.

00:05.909 --> 00:08.409
NARRATOR:
It's an <i> Ancient Aliens</i> event.

00:08.478 --> 00:10.277
This is insane.

00:10.313 --> 00:13.514
NARRATOR: As ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

00:13.550 --> 00:15.917
joins Egyptologist
Ramy Romany,

00:15.919 --> 00:18.386
for the journey of a lifetime.

00:18.455 --> 00:20.421
ROMANY: Now let's go where
no people are allowed,

00:20.490 --> 00:21.856
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:21.958 --> 00:23.257
TSOUKALOS:
This is incredible.

00:23.326 --> 00:25.393
NARRATOR:
It's a special two-hour search

00:25.462 --> 00:27.662
inside forbidden chambers...

00:27.731 --> 00:28.830
ROMANY:
Here it is.

00:28.932 --> 00:30.999
TSOUKALOS:
I have goose bumps.

00:31.101 --> 00:34.135
NARRATOR: ...and a closer
than ever exploration

00:34.237 --> 00:37.605
of the places behind mankind's
greatest unsolved mysteries.

00:37.674 --> 00:39.874
DAVID CHILDRESS:
There are things in Egypt

00:39.976 --> 00:42.343
that we cannot really explain.

00:42.345 --> 00:44.612
NARRATOR:
For thousands of years,

00:44.614 --> 00:48.883
Egypt has been known as a place
of colossal structures,

00:48.985 --> 00:51.219
strange rituals,

00:51.354 --> 00:55.623
and technologies so advanced
that they continue to astonish.

00:55.659 --> 00:57.925
ANDREW COLLINS: It's all here,
in this sanctuary...

00:57.994 --> 01:01.228
the whole story
of humanity's beginning,

01:01.264 --> 01:02.964
its place in the stars.

01:03.033 --> 01:05.566
NARRATOR: But what if
the real history of Egypt

01:05.635 --> 01:07.969
cannot be found written
on the walls

01:08.038 --> 01:09.903
of its tombs and temples,

01:09.940 --> 01:14.174
but on an alien planet,
far, far away?

01:14.211 --> 01:16.310
CHILDRESS:
Ancient Egypt was the center

01:16.346 --> 01:19.480
for extraterrestrial activity
on planet Earth.

- Earth Station Egypt -

01:56.503 --> 01:58.703
Welcome to Egypt, Giorgio.

01:58.805 --> 02:03.374
It has been 18 years
since my last visit,

02:03.410 --> 02:07.779
and in those 18 years,
I have researched so much.

02:07.781 --> 02:10.382
It is such an exciting time

02:10.517 --> 02:12.650
and I can't wait to...

02:12.753 --> 02:16.187
to see everything with new eyes.

02:16.256 --> 02:19.524
NARRATOR:
In April 2018,

02:19.593 --> 02:22.393
ancient astronaut theorist
and explorer,

02:22.429 --> 02:25.263
Giorgio Tsoukalos,
traveled to Cairo

02:25.332 --> 02:29.734
in the company of Egyptologist
and Cairo native, Ramy Romany.

02:29.836 --> 02:33.471
Joining them
is Dr. Giulio Magli,

02:33.540 --> 02:35.607
a professor of archaeoastronomy

02:35.609 --> 02:38.742
from the Polytechnic University
in Milan, Italy.

02:38.779 --> 02:41.946
Giorgio is eager
to see firsthand

02:42.015 --> 02:45.483
whether or not the recent
scientific discoveries

02:45.552 --> 02:47.084
concerning the Great Pyramid

02:47.120 --> 02:49.954
could provide further evidence
of the theory

02:50.023 --> 02:51.823
that extraterrestrials
visited Egypt

02:51.825 --> 02:53.358
thousands of years ago.

02:55.695 --> 03:00.164
I am personally very excited to
take you inside the pyramid,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.368
because the Great Pyramid
of Giza is not only

03:03.470 --> 03:05.570
one of the seven ancient wonders
of the world,

03:05.672 --> 03:07.772
it's the most ancient one
of them all.

03:07.874 --> 03:11.042
- And the only one standing, Giorgio.
- Yeah.

03:11.144 --> 03:12.643
And that's what we're gonna
see today.

03:12.712 --> 03:14.712
You know, I-I find very exciting

03:14.815 --> 03:19.517
to be able to share
and exchange information.

03:19.586 --> 03:22.787
Because what's happened
recently, in my opinion,

03:22.889 --> 03:26.124
has turned Egyptology
upside down.

03:26.193 --> 03:27.804
- MAGLI: Absolutely.
- I completely agree.

03:27.828 --> 03:30.862
And so, I think that for both of
us it will be great as well,

03:30.931 --> 03:33.731
because every time you go there,
it-it's like, uh, first time.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.835
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

03:39.106 --> 03:42.006
NARRATOR:
In November 2017,

03:42.075 --> 03:45.743
media outlets around the world
announced the discovery

03:45.745 --> 03:48.346
of what could be
an enormous chamber

03:48.415 --> 03:51.149
within the Great Pyramid
of Giza.

03:51.251 --> 03:53.817
If it can be verified,

03:53.854 --> 03:56.954
it would be the first major find
inside the pyramid

03:57.023 --> 03:59.190
since the 19th century,

03:59.292 --> 04:03.027
and a possible game-changer in
understanding both the pyramid

04:03.163 --> 04:05.296
and the people who built it.

04:05.431 --> 04:10.101
TSOUKALOS: The discovery
of that void is sensational,

04:10.203 --> 04:14.038
because it opens up
the whole discussion

04:14.107 --> 04:18.576
to more questions
and to new answers.

04:18.577 --> 04:22.714
NARRATOR: The process,
known as muography,

04:22.716 --> 04:25.516
detected a chamber that appears
to be so large

04:25.585 --> 04:28.586
it could fit the entire
Statue of Liberty

04:28.622 --> 04:30.955
from head to toe.

04:34.227 --> 04:36.260
ROMANY:
This is it, guys, the pyramids.

04:36.329 --> 04:38.263
TSOUKALOS:
Wow.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.299
Okay.

04:45.305 --> 04:48.339
- Wonderful. Incredible.
- This is incredible.

04:48.408 --> 04:49.919
ROMANY:
Look at the size of this thing.

04:49.943 --> 04:52.076
Every single block
is bigger than this car.

04:52.112 --> 04:54.879
TSOUKALOS: Yeah, it is insane,
it really is.

04:54.981 --> 04:56.541
ROMANY: Are you ready
for some climbing?

04:56.616 --> 05:00.885
TSOUKALOS: I have goose bumps
on my calves right now.

05:00.987 --> 05:02.854
Oftentimes, we throw around

05:02.956 --> 05:06.023
the words "awesome"
or "monumental,"

05:06.092 --> 05:09.427
and we don't really think
about these words,

05:09.429 --> 05:12.897
but when you stand in front
of the Great Pyramid,

05:12.999 --> 05:16.901
the word "awesome"
is, in fact, true.

05:16.970 --> 05:21.572
NARRATOR: Built from more than
two million limestone blocks,

05:21.608 --> 05:23.708
each weighing thousands
of pounds,

05:23.777 --> 05:25.776
the pyramid is aligned perfectly

05:25.845 --> 05:28.112
to the cardinal points
of the compass,

05:28.114 --> 05:31.382
north, south, east and west,

05:31.517 --> 05:33.985
suggesting that
its builders possessed

05:34.054 --> 05:36.987
extraordinary geographical
knowledge.

05:37.023 --> 05:40.658
According to mainstream
Egyptologists,

05:40.694 --> 05:43.594
the Great Pyramid was built
by the pharaoh Khufu,

05:43.630 --> 05:48.866
who reigned from 2589
to 2566 BC,

05:49.002 --> 05:52.136
during the Fourth Dynasty
of the Old Kingdom.

05:52.205 --> 05:55.740
But this notion
is hotly contested,

05:55.742 --> 05:58.476
as it is based entirely
on a single

05:58.611 --> 06:01.279
and very controversial
discovery.

06:01.414 --> 06:04.415
In 1837,

06:04.417 --> 06:07.451
British explorer
Richard Howard-Vyse claimed

06:07.487 --> 06:10.821
to have found the name of Khufu
graffiti-ed onto

06:10.890 --> 06:15.393
a stone roof of a chamber
inside the pyramid.

06:15.495 --> 06:17.961
However, it was later discovered

06:17.998 --> 06:20.731
that Vyse had written
in his private journal

06:20.767 --> 06:22.499
that he found nothing
in the chamber

06:22.535 --> 06:24.835
that looked like hieroglyphics.

06:24.904 --> 06:29.440
Some modern researchers suspect
it may have been a forgery

06:29.509 --> 06:33.311
by Vyse's team to ensure that
his expensive expedition

06:33.380 --> 06:36.381
was considered
a rousing success.

06:38.118 --> 06:39.917
One of the problems
with Egyptology

06:39.919 --> 06:44.254
is that it's something that
started in the late 1800s,

06:44.291 --> 06:48.593
and a lot of it
is sort of solidified

06:48.595 --> 06:51.529
within the university system.

06:51.664 --> 06:55.400
But Egyptologists and
archeologists and geologists

06:55.402 --> 06:59.403
are discovering new things
about Egypt all of the time

06:59.472 --> 07:02.673
that completely shakes
the foundations

07:02.742 --> 07:06.210
of what they thought they knew
about ancient Egypt.

07:06.279 --> 07:08.947
We're even finding there
are structures in Egypt

07:09.049 --> 07:13.150
much older than what the
mainstream Egyptians would say.

07:13.219 --> 07:16.954
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists

07:17.057 --> 07:20.825
and a number of prominent
archaeologists are concerned,

07:20.960 --> 07:23.694
the Great Pyramid
was likely built long before

07:23.763 --> 07:25.663
the reign of Khufu.

07:25.732 --> 07:29.100
There are some who believe
the colossal structure

07:29.102 --> 07:32.637
could even be more
than 10,000 years old,

07:32.739 --> 07:36.107
and date back to a period
pre-dating that

07:36.176 --> 07:38.709
of the Great Flood.

07:38.778 --> 07:42.045
The main reason this pyramid

07:42.082 --> 07:44.314
is the most magnificent
of all of them

07:44.351 --> 07:46.851
is not because what you're
seeing here.

07:46.986 --> 07:50.521
It's what you're about to see,
it's what's inside.

07:50.523 --> 07:52.390
Let's go.

07:52.492 --> 07:55.993
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
whatever lies within

07:56.096 --> 07:59.263
the newly discovered void
in the Great Pyramid

07:59.366 --> 08:03.534
will reveal not only incredible
truths about ancient Egypt,

08:03.603 --> 08:06.537
but about the history
of humankind?

08:06.539 --> 08:10.941
Could there be clues that reveal
that Egypt was once home

08:11.010 --> 08:14.612
to an extraterrestrial
civilization?

08:17.434 --> 08:20.168
♪ ♪

08:23.270 --> 08:26.839
NARRATOR: During his first visit
to Egypt in nearly two decades,

08:26.908 --> 08:30.008
ancient astronaut theorist,
Giorgio Tsoukalos,

08:30.044 --> 08:33.611
is eager to find out about
a recent discovery concerning

08:33.715 --> 08:37.616
a possible hidden chamber
located deep inside the walls

08:37.618 --> 08:40.486
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.486
- ROMANY: This way.
- NARRATOR: With him,

08:42.523 --> 08:44.957
are Egyptologist, Ramy Romany,

08:45.026 --> 08:48.360
and archaeoastronomer,
Dr. Giulio Magli.

08:48.396 --> 08:50.629
They are making their way

08:50.765 --> 08:52.965
to what is called
The Grand Gallery,

08:52.967 --> 08:55.768
which can only be reached
after walking up

08:55.770 --> 08:57.770
a 200-foot-long passageway.

08:57.872 --> 09:01.573
Directly above their heads
is the area where

09:01.609 --> 09:04.176
an international team
of scientists believe

09:04.245 --> 09:07.846
they may have located an
enormous hidden chamber

09:07.915 --> 09:10.849
more than 100 feet long.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.386
So this is it,
The Grand Gallery.

09:14.522 --> 09:17.722
You look at this,
and you think they made this

09:17.759 --> 09:19.091
more than 4,000 years ago.

09:19.093 --> 09:20.993
They actually built this.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.995
TSOUKALOS:
This is incredible.

09:23.064 --> 09:25.997
ROMANY: From here to the ceiling
is about ten meters high,

09:26.033 --> 09:30.869
and it goes about 50 meters in,
which is 150 feet deep.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.471
I mean, that just
gives you an idea

09:32.473 --> 09:35.607
of how huge this place is.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.209
And it's perfect.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.812
The blocks, they fit together,

09:39.814 --> 09:41.746
and no mortar was used.

09:41.783 --> 09:45.351
And you can't even put a money
bill in between the fittings.

09:45.453 --> 09:49.021
And this is what type of stone
that we're looking at in here?

09:49.123 --> 09:51.756
Unlike the rest of the pyramid,

09:51.793 --> 09:54.360
- this is red granite.
- TSOUKALOS: Red granite, right.

09:54.462 --> 09:56.562
ROMANY: Red granite doesn't come
from a local quarry

09:56.697 --> 09:59.031
- like the limestone does.
- MAGLI: It comes from Aswan.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.978
- Aswan.
- So that's a thousand kilometers away.

10:01.002 --> 10:02.635
ROMANY:
A thousand kilometers away.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.303
TSOUKALOS:
600 miles.

10:04.372 --> 10:09.308
ROMANY: So you think the void is
right on top of our heads here?

10:09.310 --> 10:11.577
And how big is it

10:11.646 --> 10:14.079
in relation to where
we're standing?

10:17.185 --> 10:19.518
- Okay, wow.
- NARRATOR: The news

10:19.653 --> 10:22.854
of a possible fourth chamber
within the Great Pyramid

10:22.890 --> 10:25.924
has become a source of
great controversy inside

10:25.960 --> 10:28.260
the archaeological community.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.195
They have long held the belief

10:30.231 --> 10:33.665
that pyramids were essentially
built as burial vaults,

10:33.701 --> 10:36.869
each possessing no more
than three chambers.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.806
Archaeologists
and Egyptologists claim

10:40.808 --> 10:43.341
that they were tombs
for the pharaohs,

10:43.377 --> 10:46.478
and yet no Egyptian pharaoh
was ever found

10:46.614 --> 10:48.613
in a pyramid in Egypt.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.918
We have found the mummies
of many Egyptian pharaohs,

10:52.987 --> 10:55.754
but they're found
in vaults deep underground

10:55.823 --> 10:58.823
at the Valley of the Kings
in Luxor,

10:58.860 --> 11:01.093
hundreds of miles away
from the pyramids.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.762
The pyramids have
no real explanation

11:03.764 --> 11:06.165
of what their purpose was.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.702
In your opinion,
what do you think

11:09.837 --> 11:13.639
is inside that void
that was just discovered?

11:24.318 --> 11:28.320
Can you elaborate
on that iron throne?

12:00.922 --> 12:03.254
NARRATOR:
A throne?

12:03.291 --> 12:07.359
Containing pieces of metal
found in a meteorite?

12:08.763 --> 12:11.363
Could such an object
really be embedded

12:11.432 --> 12:13.165
inside a secret chamber

12:13.267 --> 12:16.902
located within the Great Pyramid
of Giza?

12:16.971 --> 12:20.906
According to what are referred
to as the Pyramid Texts,

12:20.975 --> 12:23.642
a collection
of ancient religious texts

12:23.777 --> 12:26.045
that were carved on the walls
and sarcophagi

12:26.180 --> 12:30.049
of the pyramids at Saqqâra
more than 4,000 years ago,

12:30.184 --> 12:33.385
the god Osiris and his wife Isis

12:33.520 --> 12:36.054
came to Earth
from the constellation of stars

12:36.090 --> 12:37.856
known as Orion's Belt,

12:37.925 --> 12:42.594
and it is from them
that all human life originates.

12:42.730 --> 12:45.130
JONATHAN YOUNG:
Osiris was the central god

12:45.132 --> 12:46.799
of the Egyptian system,

12:46.801 --> 12:49.934
and he was a god of fertility
and-and chthonic,

12:49.971 --> 12:51.737
that is, a god of the Earth,

12:51.806 --> 12:55.273
and died and was reborn
in his son Horus.

12:55.309 --> 12:58.277
So you have the cycle
of death and rebirth.

12:58.379 --> 13:00.813
And this is part
of the-the <i> Book of the Dead.</i>

13:00.815 --> 13:02.348
So, the pharaoh, the king,

13:02.483 --> 13:05.451
would die and be resurrected.

13:08.823 --> 13:10.222
NARRATOR:
According to the story,

13:10.357 --> 13:14.159
Osiris had an iron throne
that was coveted by many

13:14.228 --> 13:17.496
who sought to possess
its awesome powers.

13:17.565 --> 13:21.233
One of these
was Osiris's brother, Set,

13:21.368 --> 13:22.968
who murdered Osiris

13:23.103 --> 13:25.570
in an effort
to obtain the throne.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.684
WILLIAM HENRY: Throughout
ancient Egypt, in the temples,

13:27.708 --> 13:29.574
we see depictions of the gods,

13:29.643 --> 13:33.112
extraterrestrial beings
on their thrones.

13:33.214 --> 13:35.314
These thrones are feathered,

13:35.416 --> 13:37.316
because they are
ascension vehicles.

13:37.451 --> 13:41.320
They are vehicles that take them
to the stars and back.

13:41.422 --> 13:44.990
I think it's very possible
that...

13:45.059 --> 13:48.460
the throne is in that void.

13:48.562 --> 13:51.997
When we found this pyramid,
there was no mummy.

13:52.066 --> 13:53.543
There were, there were
no treasures. No nothing.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.267
No hieroglyphics. Nothing.

13:55.336 --> 13:58.804
What if all this that
we're looking at is a decoy?

13:58.939 --> 14:01.606
TSOUKALOS: You just raised
a very interesting point.

14:01.642 --> 14:06.811
The fact that we've come so far
into this chamber

14:06.847 --> 14:11.683
and the entire way...
Not a single hieroglyphic.

14:11.685 --> 14:15.020
Because, throughout the rest
of Egypt,

14:15.089 --> 14:18.757
the walls are plastered
with inscriptions

14:18.759 --> 14:20.826
telling the story
of how it was built

14:20.961 --> 14:23.295
and by whom and when.

14:23.364 --> 14:27.032
Yet, here, so far,
complete anonymity.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.500
Absolutely.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.703
NARRATOR: Because the walls
inside the Great Pyramid

14:31.772 --> 14:33.538
contain no hieroglyphics

14:33.607 --> 14:36.308
and there is no evidence
that the colossal structure

14:36.377 --> 14:39.111
was ever used
as a tomb or temple,

14:39.246 --> 14:41.580
there has been
increasing speculation

14:41.649 --> 14:43.615
as to its original purpose.

14:43.617 --> 14:48.586
One theory held by numerous
scientists and archaeo-engineers

14:48.622 --> 14:50.855
is that the pyramid
and others like it

14:50.891 --> 14:52.791
may have been built as one

14:52.793 --> 14:56.862
in an enormous network
of power plants.

14:56.931 --> 15:00.332
Christopher Dunn's theories
indicate that

15:00.401 --> 15:04.269
some of these pyramids
had chemicals mixed in them.

15:04.338 --> 15:08.006
And, in fact,
studies of his working devices

15:08.109 --> 15:12.010
have shown
that this probably would work.

15:12.079 --> 15:17.015
DUNN: The pyramids were
actually geomechanical devices.

15:17.151 --> 15:18.417
In other words,

15:18.519 --> 15:21.219
they were attached to the Earth,

15:21.288 --> 15:24.489
they were tuned to vibrate

15:24.525 --> 15:26.692
with the frequencies
of the Earth,

15:26.694 --> 15:29.093
and they converted
the energies of the Earth

15:29.130 --> 15:31.763
into electromagnetic energy.

15:31.799 --> 15:35.367
The best example of this
is in the-the Great Pyramid.

15:35.369 --> 15:39.371
It's probably the most precise
structure on the planet.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.441
NARRATOR: According
to Christopher Dunn's theory,

15:42.443 --> 15:45.043
the process of generating energy

15:45.112 --> 15:48.247
began with drawing water
from the nearby Nile River

15:48.349 --> 15:51.583
to the base
of the Great Pyramid.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.453
Right in front of the door
of the entrance door

15:54.455 --> 15:56.054
of the Great Pyramid,
there used to be

15:56.123 --> 15:59.658
a well shaft,
which was documented in 1857.

15:59.727 --> 16:03.929
And so the water would
just gravity feed down into,

16:03.998 --> 16:06.531
basically, a moat
around the Great Pyramid

16:06.567 --> 16:10.134
and then go down the entrance
shaft down under the ground.

16:10.171 --> 16:13.338
The water was used
in the subterranean chamber.

16:13.407 --> 16:16.341
It is a water pump.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.877
I believe the water was used
to cause a compression wave

16:19.914 --> 16:23.615
and cause the pyramid
to resonate.

16:23.684 --> 16:25.183
DUNN:
So, in the Queen's Chamber,

16:25.252 --> 16:27.553
two chemicals were introduced:

16:27.655 --> 16:29.388
hydrated zinc
through the northern shaft

16:29.390 --> 16:31.290
and a dilute hydrochloric acid

16:31.425 --> 16:32.891
through the southern shaft.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.395
This vessel represents
the Queen's Chamber.

16:38.132 --> 16:42.968
Into the tubes we're going
to pour hydrated zinc

16:43.103 --> 16:47.372
and then hydrochloric acid.

16:47.408 --> 16:50.842
When you bring
these two liquids together,

16:50.844 --> 16:53.645
a chemical reaction occurs.

16:53.681 --> 16:58.517
And a product of that chemical
reaction is hydrogen.

16:58.519 --> 17:02.120
And you can see the vapor,
the hydrogen,

17:02.122 --> 17:05.323
escaping through the chimney.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.526
And there you have the reaction.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.262
NARRATOR: Adding credibility to
Chris Dunn's remarkable theory

17:11.298 --> 17:15.467
is the fact that traces of
both zinc and hydrochloric acid

17:15.536 --> 17:18.337
have recently been found
in the shafts leading

17:18.472 --> 17:21.006
to the so-called
Queen's Chamber.

17:21.075 --> 17:23.809
But if the pyramid
was really designed

17:23.944 --> 17:28.180
as a gigantic power plant,
how was that power applied?

17:28.281 --> 17:32.017
DUNN: We can come up
with all kinds of devices

17:32.119 --> 17:34.353
to power
with that kind of energy,

17:34.488 --> 17:38.823
uh, from simple
domestic appliances

17:38.892 --> 17:42.227
to highly advanced spacecraft.

17:42.296 --> 17:45.030
NARRATOR:
Might the Great Pyramid of Giza

17:45.165 --> 17:47.966
have been designed
as part of an enormous network

17:47.968 --> 17:49.634
of ancient power plants,

17:49.637 --> 17:54.372
not 4,000 years ago
but much, much earlier

17:54.408 --> 17:58.977
and by a civilization with
incredibly advanced knowledge?

17:58.979 --> 18:01.646
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

18:01.649 --> 18:04.182
and believe
there might be a connection

18:04.251 --> 18:06.985
between the pyramid's design
as a power plant

18:06.987 --> 18:08.786
and the possible contents

18:08.822 --> 18:13.124
of the pyramid's
newly discovered chamber.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.926
I think that,
with this new technology,

18:14.995 --> 18:19.064
we've entered
a new age of discovery.

18:19.133 --> 18:22.968
So I can't wait to see
what we'll discover next.

18:28.223 --> 18:31.358
TSOUKALOS: So, we're on our way
to the Sphinx.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.827
Are we able to get up close?

18:33.929 --> 18:35.695
Up close to the Sphinx?

18:35.697 --> 18:38.165
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.634
NARRATOR: One day
after their incredible journey

18:40.636 --> 18:43.970
inside the forbidden chambers
of the Great Pyramid,

18:44.039 --> 18:47.106
ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

18:47.176 --> 18:51.778
and Egyptologist Ramy Romany
return to the Giza Plateau,

18:51.913 --> 18:53.513
this time to investigate

18:53.615 --> 18:56.383
another
of the area's ancient wonders,

18:56.385 --> 18:58.318
the Great Sphinx.

18:58.420 --> 19:02.188
No one is allowed to actually go
down and get close,

19:02.257 --> 19:04.257
like, between the paws
of the Sphinx.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.993
No one, except for me.

19:07.128 --> 19:09.062
- And now you.
- Oh, my God.

19:09.164 --> 19:12.732
NARRATOR: Joining them
is Ramy's family friend,

19:12.835 --> 19:15.335
Dr. Zahi Hawass.

19:15.404 --> 19:19.538
Dr. Hawass is arguably the
world's best-known Egyptologist

19:19.575 --> 19:21.908
and, in 2011,

19:21.910 --> 19:25.945
Egypt's first Minister
of State Antiquities Affairs.

19:25.981 --> 19:29.983
What is so special
about the Sphinx?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.907
It's beautiful.

19:53.976 --> 19:55.308
NARRATOR:
For centuries,

19:55.377 --> 19:58.778
the Great Sphinx had appeared
only as a giant head,

19:58.914 --> 20:02.148
peering out from a mound
of deep desert sand.

20:02.217 --> 20:04.451
Only after years of excavation

20:04.586 --> 20:06.386
was the enormity
of the structure

20:06.521 --> 20:10.456
once again revealed
to the world.

20:10.525 --> 20:13.860
According
to mainstream archaeologists,

20:13.962 --> 20:18.464
the Sphinx dates back
to approximately 2500 BC,

20:18.533 --> 20:21.567
during the reign
of the pharaoh, Khafra.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.670
But in recent years, that
information has been challenged

20:24.706 --> 20:27.274
by new research, which suggests

20:27.409 --> 20:30.476
that the Sphinx
could be much, much older...

20:30.545 --> 20:34.147
possibly more
than 10,000 years old.

20:34.249 --> 20:38.084
In your opinion, what is
the most fascinating thing

20:38.153 --> 20:41.388
about the Sphinx
that you want people to know?

20:58.206 --> 21:00.140
What does it say? Tell us.

21:14.089 --> 21:16.189
NARRATOR:
Carved in rock,

21:16.324 --> 21:18.992
and located between the paws
of the Sphinx,

21:19.094 --> 21:23.129
is an ancient inscription
known as the "Dream Stela."

21:23.264 --> 21:26.599
Although mainstream
archaeologists believe

21:26.635 --> 21:29.535
it provides evidence
that the enormous statue

21:29.571 --> 21:33.606
was carved
approximately 4,500 years ago,

21:33.608 --> 21:35.342
ancient astronaut theorists,

21:35.477 --> 21:38.344
as well as a growing number
of archaeologists,

21:38.380 --> 21:41.481
believe the carving provides
compelling evidence

21:41.550 --> 21:46.419
that the Sphinx was actually
constructed much, much earlier.

21:46.488 --> 21:49.489
TSOUKALOS: The stela writings
tell us about a time

21:49.591 --> 21:53.693
when the gods still mingled
with human beings.

21:53.828 --> 21:56.629
The ancient Egyptians
were very clear in this.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.899
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists

21:59.901 --> 22:03.303
are also intrigued by another
part of the inscription

22:03.438 --> 22:06.238
in which the Sphinx
tells Thutmose that,

22:06.274 --> 22:09.776
once dug out from the sand, the
earth and everything illuminated

22:09.845 --> 22:12.378
by the "flashing eye
of the lord of all"

22:12.447 --> 22:14.380
would be his.

22:14.449 --> 22:16.382
HENRY: Now,
the amazing thing about this

22:16.451 --> 22:17.984
is that we are learning

22:18.086 --> 22:21.921
of what's called
the "flashing eye of the lord."

22:21.957 --> 22:24.324
What is
the flashing eye of the lord?

22:24.326 --> 22:26.993
This sounds like
some kind of technology

22:27.095 --> 22:29.595
that is in communication
with the Sphinx,

22:29.631 --> 22:32.031
or perhaps channeled
by the Sphinx,

22:32.100 --> 22:35.902
that could ensure the prosperity
of Thutmose IV.

22:38.206 --> 22:40.206
NARRATOR:
The Sphinx is credited

22:40.275 --> 22:43.876
with ensuring the prosperity
of Thutmose's dynastic family,

22:43.945 --> 22:47.413
that would later include
the pharaoh Akhenaten.

22:47.482 --> 22:50.550
During his reign,
Akhenaten decreed that Egypt

22:50.619 --> 22:53.185
would no longer worship
a number of gods,

22:53.221 --> 22:56.356
but just one...
the god Aten...

22:56.458 --> 23:00.160
who was depicted
as a golden disk in the sky.

23:02.064 --> 23:04.497
Akhenaten was said
to become enthralled

23:04.499 --> 23:08.300
with the sun disk
and this eye of the lord.

23:08.336 --> 23:11.304
Is it possible
that the eye of the lord

23:11.373 --> 23:14.574
and the Aten disk
are one in the same,

23:14.576 --> 23:18.978
and that they are, in fact,
some kind of UFO spaceship

23:19.047 --> 23:22.982
that's hovering over Egypt
as an eye in the sky

23:23.018 --> 23:26.319
and is guiding
Egyptian civilization?

23:26.421 --> 23:29.155
ROMANY: There is literally
no technology out there,

23:29.157 --> 23:30.823
not even carbon dating,

23:30.892 --> 23:35.662
that can actually tell us
how old exactly the Sphinx is.

23:35.797 --> 23:38.464
Mainstream Egyptology
and mainstream archaeology

23:38.533 --> 23:40.667
claim that the Sphinx
was sculpted

23:40.669 --> 23:43.870
the same time
the second pyramid was.

23:43.939 --> 23:46.005
But this all is a guess.

23:46.074 --> 23:49.008
All the knowledge we have
is still a guess.

23:49.044 --> 23:53.212
We could be off
by thousands of years.

23:53.281 --> 23:57.083
What do you think about
the alternative idea, then,

23:57.152 --> 24:01.321
that the Sphinx was-was sculpted
12,000 years ago?

24:35.690 --> 24:38.224
The-the erosion...?

24:41.329 --> 24:43.930
NARRATOR:
Dr. Hawass's contention...

24:43.999 --> 24:47.133
that the erosion evident around
the base of the Great Sphinx

24:47.135 --> 24:48.868
was caused by wind...

24:48.937 --> 24:51.537
is one that is widely held
by many scholars

24:51.606 --> 24:54.407
and mainstream archaeologists.

24:54.509 --> 24:56.809
But an increasing number
of geologists...

24:56.945 --> 24:59.278
including Dr. Robert Schoch,

24:59.347 --> 25:01.181
who has studied
the geological features

25:01.316 --> 25:03.950
of the Sphinx
for more than 20 years...

25:04.019 --> 25:07.153
are convinced
that this is not the case.

25:07.255 --> 25:10.823
SCHOCH: My geological analysis
has indicated that the Sphinx

25:10.926 --> 25:15.228
goes back much earlier to what
I call "forgotten civilization,"

25:15.330 --> 25:17.230
before dynastic Egypt.

25:17.299 --> 25:20.567
A couple of Egyptologists
in the early 20th century

25:20.669 --> 25:24.237
saw that there were weathering
patterns on the Sphinx

25:24.339 --> 25:26.706
that seemed not to fit
the weathering patterns

25:26.808 --> 25:30.043
of other structures
on the Giza Plateau.

25:30.145 --> 25:33.446
So I went to look at this
with a critical geological eye,

25:33.448 --> 25:35.715
and sure enough,
I found that there was a...

25:35.717 --> 25:39.252
incredible discrepancy between
what we see on the Sphinx

25:39.387 --> 25:42.455
and other structures
on the Giza Plateau.

25:42.557 --> 25:45.324
Here we have a photograph
of the Sphinx

25:45.393 --> 25:47.460
on the left side...

25:47.462 --> 25:49.328
this is the rump of the Sphinx;

25:49.397 --> 25:51.797
this is the wall
of the Sphinx's enclosure.

25:51.833 --> 25:55.668
When you look at this,
these are the lines of rock,

25:55.670 --> 25:58.470
or the strata,
as we say geologically.

25:58.506 --> 26:00.873
You can see how they've
been weathered out,

26:00.909 --> 26:03.743
sort of a rounded,
rolling profile.

26:03.745 --> 26:06.412
This is caused by rain
beating down

26:06.414 --> 26:08.381
and running over the rock.

26:08.516 --> 26:11.751
- (thunder rumbles)
- This was very evident to me

26:11.820 --> 26:13.819
as a geologist.

26:13.855 --> 26:17.557
This had to go back
to a earlier climatic period.

26:17.692 --> 26:21.894
CHILDRESS: If the Sphinx
was built in 2500 BC,

26:21.896 --> 26:25.298
there would not be
the amount of water erosion

26:25.433 --> 26:27.900
on the Sphinx that we can see.

26:27.902 --> 26:31.637
So either the climate of Egypt
was drastically different

26:31.706 --> 26:35.107
than what we think of
in 2500 BC,

26:35.176 --> 26:37.076
or the Sphinx is at least 10,000

26:37.211 --> 26:40.413
or 12,000 years old.

26:42.083 --> 26:45.984
The head of the Sphinx
seems to be a bit too small

26:46.021 --> 26:48.120
for the actual body,

26:48.189 --> 26:50.856
and so it has been speculated
that the head of the Sphinx

26:50.925 --> 26:52.858
was actually
something else originally,

26:52.927 --> 26:57.196
and then was re-carved to be
the head that it is today.

26:57.299 --> 26:59.298
Some archaeologists do think

26:59.301 --> 27:01.534
that the original head
on the Sphinx

27:01.603 --> 27:05.271
was the jackal head of Anubis.

27:06.308 --> 27:08.207
NARRATOR:
Anubis?

27:08.209 --> 27:11.143
One of the most ancient
of the Egyptian gods?

27:11.212 --> 27:15.281
Dating back to the time
of Isis and Osiris?

27:15.383 --> 27:17.082
But if that is true,

27:17.118 --> 27:21.420
why was the colossal statue
changed, and when?

27:21.489 --> 27:25.491
Perhaps the answer lies...
like most of Egypt's secrets...

27:25.626 --> 27:28.961
buried deep beneath
the desert sands

27:29.064 --> 27:33.966
in an area located approximately
300 feet north of the Sphinx.

27:35.470 --> 27:38.371
Relatively unexplored,
it is an area

27:38.473 --> 27:41.574
where some archeologists
and researchers believe

27:41.576 --> 27:45.511
lies yet another Sphinx,
still deeply buried,

27:45.547 --> 27:48.915
and still bearing the head
of the god Anubis.

27:52.954 --> 27:55.955
It is an idea of symmetry.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.525
(laughter)

27:59.594 --> 28:01.794
NARRATOR:
If the ancient Egyptians

28:01.830 --> 28:06.532
didn't build the Sphinx,
who did, and why?

28:06.601 --> 28:09.001
Could it have been used
by a civilization

28:09.003 --> 28:11.537
far advanced
from the one later depicted

28:11.672 --> 28:15.341
on the walls
of Egypt's tombs and temples?

28:15.443 --> 28:18.944
A civilization
whose origins were...

28:19.013 --> 28:21.848
as numerous
ancient Egyptian texts suggest...

28:21.950 --> 28:24.150
not of this world?

28:33.275 --> 28:34.742
NARRATOR:
Luxor, Egypt.

28:34.744 --> 28:37.277
1822.

28:37.346 --> 28:40.948
While exploring a tomb
in the Theban Necropolis...

28:41.017 --> 28:43.350
a site used for ritual burials

28:43.352 --> 28:45.619
for much
of the pharaonic period...

28:45.754 --> 28:49.223
Italian antiquities collector
Bernardino Drovetti

28:49.292 --> 28:51.691
comes upon
an ancient papyrus document

28:51.727 --> 28:55.029
broken up
into more than 300 pieces.

28:56.365 --> 28:58.465
When it is pieced together

28:58.601 --> 29:01.001
at the Museo Egizio
in Turin, Italy,

29:01.037 --> 29:05.339
the document is found to contain
the most extensive list to date

29:05.474 --> 29:08.342
of all the Egyptian kings.

29:09.912 --> 29:11.812
CHILDRESS:
So, in the Turin papyrus,

29:11.947 --> 29:14.414
we have three columns,
and the first column

29:14.450 --> 29:17.618
is of the gods of ancient Egypt.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.488
The second column is
of mythical kings

29:21.624 --> 29:26.026
that ruled back
into far prehistory of Egypt.

29:26.062 --> 29:28.562
And the third column is
of historical kings

29:28.664 --> 29:31.498
and pharaohs of Egypt,
and these are people

29:31.634 --> 29:34.434
that we have
an actual historical record for.

29:34.470 --> 29:38.372
So here we have a list
of kings of Egypt

29:38.474 --> 29:43.377
that's essentially saying that
Egypt has existed as a country

29:43.479 --> 29:46.313
for 36,000 years.

29:47.983 --> 29:50.651
NARRATOR: If the so-called
"Turin King List" is...

29:50.653 --> 29:53.187
as many ancient astronaut
theorists believe...

29:53.189 --> 29:57.791
an accurate account of all
the rulers of ancient Egypt,

29:57.860 --> 30:00.394
then everything that is
traditionally taught or believed

30:00.529 --> 30:04.832
about mankind's history would
be thrown into serious question.

30:05.868 --> 30:08.936
The implications are staggering,

30:08.938 --> 30:13.307
because this would rewrite
world history as we know it.

30:15.111 --> 30:18.212
Robert Bauval suggested that
the position of the pyramids

30:18.314 --> 30:22.750
aligned exactly
with the belt stars of Orion

30:22.852 --> 30:27.587
back in 10500 BC.

30:27.657 --> 30:32.359
Later, Graham Hancock
determined that the Sphinx

30:32.461 --> 30:37.698
also looks out directly
at the constellation of Leo

30:37.833 --> 30:40.034
at exactly the same time,

30:40.036 --> 30:44.538
which was also 10500 BC.

30:45.841 --> 30:48.842
NARRATOR:
10500 BC?

30:48.911 --> 30:50.844
More than 8,000 years earlier

30:50.913 --> 30:54.514
than what mainstream scholars
have long believed to be true?

30:54.550 --> 30:58.185
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

30:58.187 --> 31:02.256
and believe that somewhere,
hidden inside the Great Sphinx,

31:02.358 --> 31:05.059
could be the proof
they have been searching for

31:05.194 --> 31:08.929
concerning mankind's
extraterrestrial origins.

31:13.336 --> 31:16.336
Virginia Beach, Virginia.

31:16.405 --> 31:18.405
1932.

31:19.942 --> 31:23.143
Edgar Cayce...
an American psychic and healer

31:23.179 --> 31:26.880
famous for remotely and
accurately diagnosing illness

31:26.882 --> 31:30.017
in patients located
hundreds of miles away...

31:30.152 --> 31:34.554
has a profound vision
while in a self-induced trance.

31:34.623 --> 31:39.025
He sees himself as a high priest
in ancient Egypt,

31:39.061 --> 31:41.362
a priest
who was directly associated

31:41.497 --> 31:43.597
with the building of the Sphinx.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.967
According to Cayce's vision,

31:47.102 --> 31:49.937
this occurred not in 2500 BC,

31:50.039 --> 31:52.572
as mainstream
archaeologists suggest,

31:52.608 --> 31:55.442
but 8,000 years earlier.

31:55.544 --> 32:01.782
One of the greatest sources
for information on the...

32:01.884 --> 32:05.152
older civilization of Egypt
is Edgar Cayce.

32:05.254 --> 32:08.121
He is known
as the "sleeping prophet,"

32:08.190 --> 32:12.859
an American psychic
of great repute and note.

32:12.895 --> 32:14.861
He refers on one occasion

32:14.930 --> 32:19.933
to the date of 10390 BC,

32:19.969 --> 32:24.471
when he tells us,
not only was this a time

32:24.606 --> 32:27.608
that the Great Sphinx of Giza
was created,

32:27.610 --> 32:30.811
but he also tells us
that the records

32:30.813 --> 32:33.614
of some previous civilization

32:33.616 --> 32:38.084
that had existed on Atlantis
were buried within this.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.220
NARRATOR:
Atlantis?

32:40.256 --> 32:42.423
The legendary "lost continent"?

32:42.525 --> 32:45.959
According
to the Greek philosopher Plato...

32:46.028 --> 32:49.029
who wrote about it
in the 4th century BC...

32:49.131 --> 32:51.498
Atlantis was an island
in the Atlantic

32:51.500 --> 32:54.701
that was home to
a highly-advanced civilization,

32:54.770 --> 32:58.771
but was wiped out
by a great flood.

32:58.808 --> 33:03.043
In his vision,
Edgar Cayce believed he saw...

33:03.112 --> 33:05.078
under the right paw
of the Sphinx...

33:05.147 --> 33:07.781
a chamber that holds
a hall of records

33:07.783 --> 33:10.984
from the lost civilization
of Atlantis.

33:11.053 --> 33:13.119
CHILDRESS:
Edgar Cayce said there was

33:13.155 --> 33:18.659
a repository
of high-tech devices

33:18.761 --> 33:24.731
and machines that had been left
there for thousands of years

33:24.867 --> 33:26.799
for people to discover

33:26.836 --> 33:31.671
during our time period on Earth,
our civilization,

33:31.740 --> 33:36.276
that we would discover these
ancient high-tech artifacts

33:36.312 --> 33:38.879
in chambers beneath the Sphinx.

33:38.881 --> 33:41.615
NARRATOR:
Based on Plato's writings,

33:41.717 --> 33:46.353
Atlantis would have existed
approximately 12,000 years ago.

33:46.422 --> 33:49.423
This matches up
with the time period

33:49.425 --> 33:52.559
when the Giza Pyramids
and the Sphinx were aligned

33:52.561 --> 33:57.163
with the constellations
of both Orion and Leo.

33:57.199 --> 33:59.365
Some researchers also suggest

33:59.401 --> 34:03.270
this was the same era that was
described in ancient writings

34:03.272 --> 34:07.040
as Egypt's so-called,
"Golden Age" or "Zep Tepi,"

34:07.109 --> 34:09.842
a time in Egyptian prehistory

34:09.911 --> 34:15.715
when the god Osiris had come
down to Earth from the stars.

34:15.784 --> 34:18.185
COLLINS:
There are accounts

34:18.320 --> 34:20.654
from the walls
of different temples

34:20.723 --> 34:25.792
that tell
of an earlier age of activity.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.360
And it was said
that this was when

34:27.429 --> 34:32.532
the gods themselves
actually enter into Egypt

34:32.601 --> 34:37.003
and create everything
that becomes a part

34:37.072 --> 34:39.672
of the later
Egyptian civilization.

34:39.808 --> 34:44.010
They create the first enclosure,
the first temple,

34:44.079 --> 34:47.614
and various
other strange structures,

34:47.616 --> 34:51.484
which suggest some form
of high technology,

34:51.554 --> 34:54.288
and suggest
that we might be dealing here

34:54.290 --> 34:56.956
with an advanced culture.

34:57.059 --> 34:59.092
NARRATOR:
Although there are many

34:59.094 --> 35:02.028
who dismissed Edgar Cayce's
incredible vision

35:02.097 --> 35:04.097
as a mere hallucination,

35:04.200 --> 35:10.170
in 1978... 46 years after
his trance... two of the tunnels

35:10.172 --> 35:12.572
Cayce envisioned
were indeed discovered:

35:12.641 --> 35:15.041
one behind the head
of the Sphinx,

35:15.077 --> 35:18.044
and another directly below.

35:18.113 --> 35:20.647
But mainstream Egyptologists
continue

35:20.749 --> 35:23.049
to insist
these tunnels were made

35:23.085 --> 35:25.385
long after
the Sphinx was constructed.

35:55.651 --> 35:57.951
NARRATOR:
But is the discovery

35:58.020 --> 36:00.854
of 2,500-year-old pottery proof

36:00.989 --> 36:03.489
that the tunnels
beneath the Sphinx were made

36:03.525 --> 36:05.091
at the same time?

36:05.127 --> 36:08.295
Ancient astronaut theorists
say no,

36:08.430 --> 36:10.430
and argue that artifacts

36:10.565 --> 36:12.832
from an earlier period
could have been removed

36:12.868 --> 36:15.835
during the Sphinx's
numerous renovations.

36:15.904 --> 36:19.839
They also believe
more evidence can be found

36:19.908 --> 36:23.310
by exploring additional pyramids
throughout Egypt,

36:23.312 --> 36:25.312
and by examining the legends

36:25.447 --> 36:27.647
concerning
a mysterious capstone

36:27.683 --> 36:32.486
and its direct link
to extraterrestrial visitations.

36:37.508 --> 36:39.875
NARRATOR:
Saqqâra, Egypt.

36:40.010 --> 36:42.811
This ancient necropolis,

36:42.946 --> 36:46.481
located 15 miles south
of the Giza Plateau,

36:46.550 --> 36:50.151
is home to what mainstream
archaeologists suggest

36:50.187 --> 36:52.754
is the first pyramid ever built
in Egypt:

36:52.823 --> 36:56.625
the Step Pyramid of King Djoser.

36:56.727 --> 36:58.894
The step pyramid at Saqqâra
is known

36:58.896 --> 37:00.362
as "The Stairway to Heaven."

37:00.364 --> 37:03.031
The complex is vast.
It's about 40 acres.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.233
Entirely walled in.

37:05.269 --> 37:07.836
There's a 30-foot wall
with 13 false doors.

37:07.838 --> 37:11.239
You only get in if you know
where the right door is.

37:11.241 --> 37:13.175
NARRATOR:
Curiously,

37:13.277 --> 37:15.177
the only reason why
the pyramid is believed

37:15.312 --> 37:18.914
to have been built as a tomb
for King Djoser is

37:18.916 --> 37:23.317
that statues of the monarch
were found inside the pyramid.

37:23.353 --> 37:27.189
Like all other pyramids,
there was no credible evidence

37:27.324 --> 37:30.325
that a body was ever
entombed there.

37:30.394 --> 37:33.327
Now this pyramid
is 5,000 years old.

37:33.363 --> 37:34.996
That's amazing.

37:35.065 --> 37:38.133
So is all of this made out of...
from mud brick?

37:38.135 --> 37:40.402
Correct,
this was all made of mud brick

37:40.404 --> 37:42.737
just similar to that era.

37:42.773 --> 37:44.806
The leap between this

37:44.941 --> 37:48.075
and then the Great Pyramid
of Giza was massive.

37:48.111 --> 37:51.880
NARRATOR: In recent years,
the conventional notion

37:52.015 --> 37:55.283
that the step pyramid was built
only 80 years earlier

37:55.418 --> 37:58.820
than the Great Pyramid of Giza
has been challenged,

37:58.922 --> 38:01.356
not only
by ancient astronaut theorists,

38:01.358 --> 38:06.561
but also an increasing number
of archaeologists and scholars.

38:06.663 --> 38:10.298
They believe that the likelihood
that Egyptians went

38:10.433 --> 38:14.836
from building a 200-foot-tall
step pyramid out of mud bricks

38:14.938 --> 38:18.440
to building a monumental marvel
like the Great Pyramid

38:18.442 --> 38:22.910
in only 80 years
to be a virtual absurdity.

38:22.980 --> 38:26.247
They also believe
that the mathematical precision

38:26.316 --> 38:27.982
of the Great Pyramid's
construction

38:28.018 --> 38:30.919
coupled
with its precise alignments,

38:30.921 --> 38:34.389
not only with regard
to Earth's cardinal directions,

38:34.524 --> 38:36.658
but also
to the Orion constellation,

38:36.793 --> 38:41.596
is proof that it was built by
a highly-advanced civilization.

38:41.698 --> 38:45.333
SCOTT CREIGHTON: One of the
things you find, for example,

38:45.435 --> 38:47.835
is that if you take
the geodetic location

38:47.837 --> 38:50.672
of the Great Pyramid
as a decimal degree...

39:52.035 --> 39:54.468
NARRATOR: According
to ancient astronaut theory,

39:54.504 --> 39:57.338
the Great Pyramid
was most likely built

39:57.374 --> 39:59.540
more than 12,000 years ago,

39:59.576 --> 40:04.278
some 7,000 years before the
building of the step pyramid,

40:04.348 --> 40:07.615
and sometime before
the cataclysmic event known

40:07.684 --> 40:09.684
as "The Great Flood."

40:09.786 --> 40:13.421
They also believe
that after the flood,

40:13.457 --> 40:16.157
the original function
of the Great Pyramid

40:16.226 --> 40:18.759
as a power plant
was long forgotten,

40:18.795 --> 40:20.795
along with all of mankind's

40:20.930 --> 40:23.431
other technological
achievements,

40:23.467 --> 40:27.235
and that it would take a series
of interventions

40:27.304 --> 40:29.504
by other
extraterrestrial visitors

40:29.639 --> 40:33.408
to help humans rebuild the world
they once knew.

40:34.911 --> 40:38.179
In the text
that we can read about Djoser,

40:38.248 --> 40:43.451
does he mention at all how
he was inspired to build this?

40:43.553 --> 40:45.987
It was one brilliant man.

40:46.089 --> 40:49.124
That man was called Imhotep.

40:49.226 --> 40:50.725
Okay.

40:50.727 --> 40:52.326
Who, in history,
came out of nowhere.

40:52.396 --> 40:55.930
He was the designer and engineer
of that pyramid.

40:55.999 --> 40:58.599
What does "Imhotep"
actually mean?

40:58.668 --> 41:01.336
It means...
I know you're gonna like this...

41:01.471 --> 41:05.373
- it means "I come in peace."
- Oh, really?

41:05.508 --> 41:07.208
- Yes.
- That's very interesting.

41:07.244 --> 41:10.745
- So the extraterrestrial greeting
so to speak? - Yes.

41:10.814 --> 41:14.482
He showed up into the life
of the king out of nowhere,

41:14.584 --> 41:18.153
and then ascended into position
so quickly,

41:18.288 --> 41:20.221
which is very uncommon
in ancient Egypt.

41:20.323 --> 41:22.824
What does that mean? What do
you mean "out of nowhere"?

41:22.959 --> 41:26.027
Did he drop from the sky, or
did he come from another land?

41:26.096 --> 41:28.363
In Egyptian history,
you can normally trace

41:28.465 --> 41:30.698
every position back
to their parents,

41:30.767 --> 41:33.468
but Imhotep... nothing.

41:33.570 --> 41:39.106
YOUNG: Imhotep was a commoner,
but a brilliant thinker

41:39.142 --> 41:41.576
who grew to great influence

41:41.645 --> 41:44.645
during the time of the pharaohs
that he served,

41:44.714 --> 41:47.715
and then became
virtually immortalized.

41:47.784 --> 41:50.185
That is unlike
any other commoner.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.920
A cult formed around him.

41:52.055 --> 41:55.056
Some have suspected

41:55.058 --> 41:58.259
that he was possibly Joseph
from the Bible.

41:58.328 --> 42:01.529
That's interesting,
because Joseph was an adviser

42:01.664 --> 42:04.899
to a pharaoh in about
the same period of time.

42:05.001 --> 42:07.001
What we know for sure is

42:07.037 --> 42:09.938
that he was a brilliant
scientist for his day.

42:10.040 --> 42:13.942
HENRY: Imhotep rose
to the incredible status

42:14.077 --> 42:16.811
as the vizier,
or wizard to the pharaoh.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.814
This is where we get that word
"wizard," from "vizier."

42:19.883 --> 42:22.483
There are great mysteries
about who Imhotep was,

42:22.519 --> 42:24.351
where he came from.

42:24.387 --> 42:29.224
This is interesting, because
later on, Imhotep is deified.

42:29.226 --> 42:32.093
And what's fascinating is
the depictions of him.

42:32.228 --> 42:35.296
He looks like
he's got this oversize head.

42:35.332 --> 42:39.934
He's got strange-looking hands.
He almost looks non-human.

42:40.036 --> 42:42.436
And one of
the extraordinary texts tell us

42:42.506 --> 42:45.306
that his knowledge may have come
from the stars.

42:45.342 --> 42:49.177
Did Imhotep himself ever mention

42:49.279 --> 42:53.114
where he was educated or how
he came by the knowledge of

42:53.216 --> 42:55.183
building something like this,
for example?

42:55.185 --> 42:56.918
ROMANY:
In ancient Egyptian history,

42:56.920 --> 43:00.788
Imhotep spoke
like a true ancient Egyptian.

43:00.891 --> 43:04.525
And everything he has...
his beauty, his knowledge...

43:04.594 --> 43:07.528
and everything he has
is from the gods.

43:07.564 --> 43:09.464
Do we know how long he lived?

43:09.599 --> 43:11.466
That is also a mystery.

43:11.601 --> 43:13.901
We don't know how he died,
but he was buried in a tomb.

43:14.036 --> 43:17.204
And that tomb
was around here in Saqqâra.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.674
The tomb of Imhotep
has never been found.

43:19.776 --> 43:22.076
- So far, right? Yeah.
- So far.

43:22.078 --> 43:24.212
But look around you.
The desert is massive.

43:24.314 --> 43:26.481
When the tomb of Imhotep
is discovered,

43:26.583 --> 43:28.783
it will be the discovery
of the century.

43:31.054 --> 43:34.688
NARRATOR: If the tomb of Imhotep
is discovered,

43:34.724 --> 43:36.624
will it provide further evidence

43:36.626 --> 43:40.628
that ancient Egyptian legends
of gods descending to Earth

43:40.630 --> 43:42.530
from the constellation of Orion

43:42.665 --> 43:45.099
are based on fact?

43:46.136 --> 43:48.536
Perhaps.

43:49.673 --> 43:52.307
But until that day comes,

43:52.409 --> 43:54.042
there are many who believe

43:54.144 --> 43:57.478
that proof of humankind's
extraterrestrial ancestry

43:57.614 --> 43:59.447
already exists,

43:59.516 --> 44:03.517
in the form of curiously carved,
pyramid-shaped objects

44:03.587 --> 44:06.921
known as Benben stones.

44:06.990 --> 44:09.991
This is it, Giorgio,

44:09.993 --> 44:12.726
one of the many Benben stones,

44:12.762 --> 44:15.597
or pyramidions,
inside the museum.

44:15.732 --> 44:16.864
Look at it.

44:16.933 --> 44:19.600
It's absolutely magnificent.

44:19.669 --> 44:21.602
And it's perfect.

44:21.671 --> 44:23.671
- Absolutely.
- I mean, if you look at it,

44:23.707 --> 44:26.407
there's not a single mistake.

44:26.476 --> 44:27.476
Anywhere.

44:27.543 --> 44:29.877
Just wonderful.

44:29.946 --> 44:32.813
I'm familiar
with the stories of the Benben,

44:32.882 --> 44:36.551
and I'm fascinated
that sometimes it was described

44:36.553 --> 44:39.687
as this shape descending
from the sky

44:39.789 --> 44:42.290
with a lot of smoke
and a lot of fire.

44:42.359 --> 44:46.360
And then a door opened
and people walked out.

44:46.396 --> 44:49.296
So, to me, as a mythology,

44:49.332 --> 44:52.233
that is fascinating, because

44:52.335 --> 44:54.502
where did that story originate?

44:54.637 --> 44:55.637
Yeah.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.974
NARRATOR: According
to mainstream Egyptologists,

45:00.043 --> 45:02.443
the story of the Benben stone

45:02.512 --> 45:04.845
is part of a religious allegory

45:04.914 --> 45:07.248
conceived by ancient Egyptians

45:07.350 --> 45:11.452
to explain
how humankind was created.

45:11.587 --> 45:14.521
But according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

45:14.557 --> 45:18.893
the stone is based
on an actual historical event,

45:18.995 --> 45:21.862
one that predates the building
of the Great Pyramid

45:21.898 --> 45:25.132
by thousands of years.

45:25.201 --> 45:29.270
TSOUKALOS: So when I hear
a story like the Benben stone,

45:29.339 --> 45:34.008
I wonder if this may have been
some type of a craft.

45:34.110 --> 45:36.410
Egyptologists agree

45:36.446 --> 45:38.880
that this type of a shape

45:38.882 --> 45:43.884
descended from the sky
in a giant fireball,

45:43.920 --> 45:46.154
made a controlled landing,

45:46.289 --> 45:48.622
the Benben stone opened,

45:48.692 --> 45:51.692
and people walked out.

45:51.695 --> 45:54.828
The first creator gods.

45:54.864 --> 45:56.830
In my opinion,

45:56.866 --> 46:00.768
I think these gods were
flesh-and-blood space travelers

46:00.870 --> 46:04.638
whom the ancient Egyptians
and many other ancient cultures

46:04.708 --> 46:09.444
misinterpreted as divine
or spiritual beings

46:09.446 --> 46:13.448
because of their technological
frame of reference

46:13.583 --> 46:16.784
of their current time.

46:16.886 --> 46:18.652
This ties in directly

46:18.722 --> 46:23.190
with the idea
of misunderstood technology.

46:23.259 --> 46:27.995
When a technologically primitive
society interacts

46:27.997 --> 46:31.332
with a technologically advanced
society,

46:31.334 --> 46:34.335
the primitive society
begins to worship

46:34.470 --> 46:36.603
the advanced society.

46:36.639 --> 46:40.475
I once read that a Benben stone

46:40.477 --> 46:43.077
can also be considered the home

46:43.146 --> 46:45.546
- of the gods.
- Yes.

46:45.648 --> 46:48.882
From my perspective,
then that would be proof

46:48.918 --> 46:52.019
of extraterrestrial
intervention.

46:52.088 --> 46:53.488
Right here,

46:53.490 --> 46:57.358
this is a physical piece
of evidence that,

46:57.427 --> 47:00.428
a long time ago,
someone descended

47:00.430 --> 47:05.466
from the sky and taught mankind
in various disciplines.

47:07.170 --> 47:10.438
NARRATOR: If the original
Benben stone was inspired

47:10.440 --> 47:12.639
by an actual alien spacecraft,

47:12.675 --> 47:15.909
as many ancient astronaut
theorists believe,

47:15.945 --> 47:19.113
does the legend surrounding it
further suggest

47:19.115 --> 47:21.315
that Egypt was one
of the centers

47:21.351 --> 47:24.719
of extraterrestrial activity
on our planet?

47:24.821 --> 47:29.857
Ancient astronaut theorists say
the answer is a profound yes,

47:29.959 --> 47:33.127
and they suggest that
further evidence can be found

47:33.196 --> 47:37.398
not by examining ancient
Egyptian scrolls and hieroglyphs

47:37.467 --> 47:40.367
but by carefully reading
the pages

47:40.437 --> 47:42.837
of the Holy Bible.

47:47.258 --> 47:49.725
NARRATOR:
Cairo, Egypt.

47:49.860 --> 47:53.161
The 14th century AD.

47:53.230 --> 47:55.831
Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi

47:55.900 --> 47:58.300
begins work
on a series of writings

47:58.302 --> 48:01.503
that propose that the history
of the Giza Plateau

48:01.572 --> 48:04.439
dates back much further
than what is accepted

48:04.508 --> 48:08.043
by the mainstream historians
of his day.

48:08.178 --> 48:11.713
He has concluded that
the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx

48:11.749 --> 48:15.183
were not constructed in 2500 BC,

48:15.252 --> 48:18.052
but thousands of years earlier,

48:18.088 --> 48:21.056
by a king named Saurid.

48:21.125 --> 48:24.059
ERICH VON DANIKEN: Now,
according to usual knowledge,

48:24.128 --> 48:26.195
we believe that the
Great Pyramid was constructed

48:26.330 --> 48:28.030
by the Fourth Dynasty,

48:28.165 --> 48:30.665
more or less, two and a half
thousand years from now.

48:30.701 --> 48:34.369
But old Arabian traditions...

48:34.472 --> 48:37.272
for example,
Ibrahim Abdulla al-Masudi...

48:37.341 --> 48:42.010
they say that the Great Pyramid
was constructed by a ruler.

48:42.012 --> 48:43.278
His name was Saurid.

48:43.347 --> 48:46.348
And they say Saurid is the same

48:46.350 --> 48:49.551
which the Hebrew call Enoch.

48:49.553 --> 48:53.922
Now, Arabian notation says
Enoch plus Methuselah

48:53.991 --> 48:57.091
constructed the Great Pyramid.

48:57.127 --> 48:59.294
NARRATOR:
Enoch?

48:59.296 --> 49:01.430
The same Enoch
who was written about

49:01.532 --> 49:04.366
in one of the so-called
lost chapters of the Bible,

49:04.368 --> 49:07.235
who supposedly was taken up
to heaven by angels

49:07.271 --> 49:12.307
called watchers in order for him
to observe the human race?

49:12.376 --> 49:15.043
Could he really have been
the same person

49:15.045 --> 49:18.446
who was responsible for the
building of the Great Pyramid

49:18.482 --> 49:21.316
more than 12,000 years ago?

49:21.418 --> 49:24.119
HENRY: The Book of Enoch
is a text that is believed

49:24.188 --> 49:26.655
to have been written
by the Essenes, Jewish mystics,

49:26.757 --> 49:30.792
sometime between the third
and second century BC.

49:30.861 --> 49:33.595
In the story, they tell
how one of the watcher angels,

49:33.597 --> 49:36.598
the archangel, Michael,
came to Earth

49:36.667 --> 49:39.401
and took Enoch
into the heavenly realms,

49:39.403 --> 49:41.069
to the throne of God,

49:41.071 --> 49:44.673
where Enoch is educated
by the angels

49:44.675 --> 49:47.141
and given an opportunity
to return to Earth

49:47.177 --> 49:50.278
to share the accumulated
knowledge that he received.

49:50.347 --> 49:53.615
It's very similar to what we see
in the Pyramid Texts,

49:53.684 --> 49:57.285
where the pharaoh is taken
into the stellar realms,

49:57.354 --> 49:59.955
where his body becomes
like lightning,

50:00.024 --> 50:02.958
where the doors of heaven
are opened,

50:03.027 --> 50:07.162
and where a human then
can be educated by the gods.

50:07.264 --> 50:10.165
NARRATOR:
Are the so-called Pyramid Texts

50:10.300 --> 50:13.168
and the Hebrew Bible's
apocryphal Book of Enoch

50:13.303 --> 50:17.305
both referencing
the same period in prehistory,

50:17.374 --> 50:20.976
a period
where extraterrestrial beings,

50:21.045 --> 50:24.646
referred to as gods,
ruled the Earth?

50:24.648 --> 50:27.916
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

50:27.985 --> 50:30.652
and believe
further evidence can be found

50:30.787 --> 50:33.322
by closely examining
ancient texts

50:33.457 --> 50:34.923
concerning a race of angels

50:35.025 --> 50:39.027
that are referred to
as the watchers.

50:42.166 --> 50:43.309
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
In the Bible,

50:43.333 --> 50:45.000
there's a very curious passage

50:45.069 --> 50:47.402
that speaks
about the sons of God

50:47.404 --> 50:49.203
who came down from heaven

50:49.239 --> 50:52.407
and took daughters of men
as brides,

50:52.443 --> 50:57.345
from which came forth
"the mighty ones."

50:57.414 --> 51:01.282
They came down with knowledge,

51:01.352 --> 51:04.085
knowledge which we today
would understand

51:04.121 --> 51:06.088
as technology and science,

51:06.223 --> 51:08.623
and they became corrupted.

51:08.692 --> 51:12.027
They made matters worse,
not better.

51:12.162 --> 51:14.829
And this is what led
to God's decision

51:14.865 --> 51:16.698
to bring the flood.

51:16.800 --> 51:20.435
NARRATOR:
According to the Book of Enoch,

51:20.537 --> 51:22.704
the watchers were sent by God

51:22.839 --> 51:25.774
in order to help mankind
on Earth.

51:25.909 --> 51:28.643
But after a number
of these watchers

51:28.646 --> 51:30.879
had sex with human women

51:30.981 --> 51:33.982
and produced children
in the form of giant mutants

51:33.984 --> 51:35.984
known as the Nephilim,

51:35.986 --> 51:40.288
God caused a great flood that
was intended to destroy them,

51:40.290 --> 51:45.127
along with all those
who disobeyed his will.

51:45.229 --> 51:47.996
Our main knowledge
of the Nephilim

51:48.065 --> 51:50.799
comes not just from the Bible,

51:50.901 --> 51:53.735
but also from the Book of Enoch

51:53.737 --> 51:56.805
and also the so-called
Book of Giants.

51:56.874 --> 52:01.376
The Book of Giants says
that they were destroyed

52:01.478 --> 52:05.781
in a cataclysm
that not only involved a deluge

52:05.883 --> 52:09.751
but also fire
that came out of the sky.

52:09.853 --> 52:13.655
And I think
that we can connect this story

52:13.724 --> 52:19.294
with what we call the
Younger Dryas comet impact event

52:19.429 --> 52:24.432
that took place around 10800 BC

52:24.435 --> 52:28.703
that is known to have had
a massive effect

52:28.739 --> 52:32.207
upon the Northern Hemisphere
at this time.

52:34.778 --> 52:37.879
NARRATOR: If, as ancient
astronaut theorists believe,

52:37.948 --> 52:40.115
the foundations
of ancient biblical

52:40.217 --> 52:43.919
and Egyptian texts are not based
on mere imagination

52:43.921 --> 52:47.455
but on actual historical events,

52:47.524 --> 52:50.191
then it serves to strengthen
their contention

52:50.260 --> 52:52.193
that the roots of ancient Egypt

52:52.262 --> 52:55.397
stretch back far earlier
than currently believed

52:55.499 --> 52:59.101
by mainstream scholars
and archaeologists.

53:01.238 --> 53:04.339
TSOUKALOS:
Archaeology is rooted

53:04.474 --> 53:06.407
in interpretation,

53:06.443 --> 53:08.810
just like
the ancient astronaut theory.

53:08.945 --> 53:11.546
I'm still
of the personal opinion

53:11.548 --> 53:14.282
that the Great Pyramid complex,

53:14.284 --> 53:15.817
including the Sphinx,

53:15.886 --> 53:19.921
date back to a time
when the gods

53:19.990 --> 53:22.891
walked among humans.

53:22.960 --> 53:26.027
Something extraordinary happened

53:26.163 --> 53:29.464
right here in ancient Egypt,

53:29.533 --> 53:34.703
perhaps under the tutelage
of extraterrestrials,

53:34.838 --> 53:38.439
teachers
from another star system.

53:38.509 --> 53:41.243
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrials

53:41.378 --> 53:45.180
and giant hybrid beings
really did inhabit Egypt

53:45.182 --> 53:48.850
thousands of years
before the first human pharaohs,

53:48.919 --> 53:52.787
could physical proof lie hidden
within the mysterious void

53:52.856 --> 53:56.391
recently discovered
inside the Great Pyramid?

53:56.493 --> 54:00.562
Or could it be found elsewhere

54:00.631 --> 54:03.665
in the form of 24 stone coffins

54:03.800 --> 54:07.235
buried deep beneath
the desert sands?

54:11.256 --> 54:14.323
NARRATOR
Saqqâra, Egypt. 1850.

54:14.359 --> 54:17.927
While on an expedition
to recover ancient manuscripts

54:18.062 --> 54:20.330
for the Louvre Museum in Paris,

54:20.465 --> 54:25.201
French Egyptologist Auguste
Mariette spots a strange object

54:25.270 --> 54:27.670
sticking out of the sand.

54:27.672 --> 54:30.740
Intrigued, Mariette has
the sand cleared away

54:30.842 --> 54:34.944
and finds large rocks blocking
what looks to be the entrance

54:35.013 --> 54:37.379
to an underground chamber.

54:37.415 --> 54:42.251
After using explosives
to remove them,

54:42.354 --> 54:45.855
he gains entrance
to a tomb complex,

54:45.857 --> 54:48.591
also known as the Serapeum.

54:48.693 --> 54:51.927
The Serapeum of Saqqâra,
Giorgio.

54:51.997 --> 54:55.931
- Yes.
- Oh, it's magnificent.

54:56.001 --> 54:59.402
The name "Serapeum" comes
from Serapis,

54:59.504 --> 55:02.538
- which is Apis bull and Osiris.
- Yes. Right.

55:02.673 --> 55:05.007
ROMANY: Combined together
in one Greek god.

55:05.076 --> 55:09.479
This is one
of the most mysterious places

55:09.614 --> 55:11.714
in all of Egypt, Giorgio.

55:11.849 --> 55:14.317
TSOUKALOS:
Look how far all this goes!

55:14.452 --> 55:17.453
NARRATOR: Located deep beneath
the desert surface

55:17.522 --> 55:20.656
lies a 700-foot-long passageway.

55:20.759 --> 55:23.659
There,
located in a series of alcoves

55:23.795 --> 55:26.929
neatly carved out
of the limestone rock

55:26.998 --> 55:29.799
are 24 gigantic
stone sarcophagi,

55:29.934 --> 55:32.869
perfectly constructed
from solid granite,

55:32.871 --> 55:36.539
and each weighing
roughly 100 tons...

55:36.541 --> 55:40.810
the equivalent
of 55 mid-sized automobiles.

55:40.912 --> 55:45.814
The boxes themselves are,
what, 70 to 75 tons?

55:45.850 --> 55:48.017
And then the lids

55:48.086 --> 55:51.620
are estimated
to be 20 to 25 tons.

55:51.689 --> 55:55.758
It's one of the most mysterious
things about this place is

55:55.760 --> 55:58.694
really how they managed

55:58.763 --> 56:01.097
to bring these heavy structures

56:01.199 --> 56:03.299
all the way down here

56:03.434 --> 56:06.035
when we're breathing heavily
just to get to the end.

56:06.037 --> 56:07.636
(Tsoukalos laughs)

56:07.705 --> 56:11.107
TSOUKALOS: Can we actually
go down to some of these?

56:11.109 --> 56:12.308
Of course we can.

56:12.410 --> 56:14.710
Wow.

56:14.712 --> 56:16.445
You know,
I've always read about these,

56:16.448 --> 56:19.248
I've seen pictures,
but it's humungous!

56:19.317 --> 56:22.718
You can walk underneath it!
(laughs)

56:22.787 --> 56:26.589
NARRATOR: Each sarcophagus
measures 13 feet long,

56:26.658 --> 56:30.526
seven and a half feet wide
and over ten feet tall.

56:30.661 --> 56:33.729
But just how
the ancient Egyptians managed

56:33.765 --> 56:37.934
to transport these massive
granite boxes remains unknown,

56:37.936 --> 56:40.870
as does their intended purpose.

56:40.939 --> 56:42.938
As far as conventional
Egyptologists

56:42.974 --> 56:45.741
and archaeologists
are concerned,

56:45.877 --> 56:48.611
the sarcophagi were meant
to house the remains

56:48.680 --> 56:51.180
of the sacred Apis bulls.

56:51.282 --> 56:55.551
But as only one of the tombs was
found to contain animal remains,

56:55.620 --> 56:58.154
and all the others
were found empty,

56:58.289 --> 57:02.291
the true nature of the Serapeum
is a source of deep contention

57:02.327 --> 57:06.896
as far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned.

57:06.965 --> 57:10.966
The Apis bull is
a representation for god Osiris,

57:11.035 --> 57:13.369
and there's something
very important to mention.

57:13.471 --> 57:17.373
Ancient Egyptians
did not worship animals.

57:17.375 --> 57:19.842
Their concept was, the gods

57:19.844 --> 57:21.910
sent the animals
to be their messengers,

57:21.946 --> 57:24.446
and we have to respect them
in that way.

57:24.516 --> 57:27.116
NARRATOR:
Based on an artifact

57:27.118 --> 57:30.453
from the 4th millennium BC
called "The Bull Palette,"

57:30.588 --> 57:32.788
some Egyptologists believe

57:32.790 --> 57:37.726
worship of the Apis bull dates
back at least 6,000 years.

57:37.795 --> 57:42.464
It was said that the first ever
Apis bull was created

57:42.500 --> 57:46.535
when a ray of light came down
from heaven itself

57:46.538 --> 57:52.808
and struck this cow who produced
the first Apis bull.

57:52.810 --> 57:54.743
So there is some relationship

57:54.812 --> 57:58.614
between the bull itself
and the stars.

57:58.749 --> 58:01.751
Those bulls were said
to have the markings

58:01.753 --> 58:04.420
of a falcon on their back,

58:04.489 --> 58:07.156
as well as a diamond
on the forehead,

58:07.291 --> 58:09.725
and the scarab
beneath the tongue,

58:09.727 --> 58:12.628
all of which were symbols
of the sky world,

58:12.763 --> 58:14.630
all of which indicate

58:14.765 --> 58:17.233
that here
we have a place of contact

58:17.235 --> 58:19.302
with the other world itself.

58:19.437 --> 58:25.007
And the greatest mystery to do
with this bull is the Serapeum.

58:26.778 --> 58:28.910
The sides,
and also here the bottom...

58:28.947 --> 58:32.381
the polishing is perfect.

58:32.417 --> 58:37.386
And we can illustrate this
by just looking at the angle.

58:37.455 --> 58:39.521
I mean, it's a perfect
90-degree angle.

58:39.591 --> 58:41.123
Check this out.

58:41.125 --> 58:43.792
It is absolute perfection.

58:43.861 --> 58:45.727
It's easy to cut limestone,

58:45.763 --> 58:49.332
but to cut basalt is, uh...

58:49.467 --> 58:51.467
(laughs)
That's a different story.

58:51.569 --> 58:55.103
What do these inscriptions here
say?

58:55.139 --> 58:57.473
These inscriptions were
extremely important.

58:57.542 --> 59:01.877
You see the doors. Specifically,
the so-called "false doors."

59:01.980 --> 59:04.146
They were the doors
that allowed the spirit,

59:04.249 --> 59:06.882
the ka and the ba,
the spirit and the soul

59:06.985 --> 59:09.752
to come out from the mummy.

59:09.821 --> 59:11.887
And then read
the hieroglyphic inscriptions.

59:12.023 --> 59:13.823
They wanted to make sure

59:13.925 --> 59:17.627
that these Apis bulls
come back to life,

59:17.762 --> 59:22.832
go to eternity so they could
stay with Osiris in the sky.

59:22.934 --> 59:24.900
Ancient historians' accounts,

59:25.003 --> 59:28.838
like Herodotus,
Strabo, Eusebius...

59:28.940 --> 59:32.241
all of these old,
old chroniclers speak

59:32.310 --> 59:37.579
of a former glory age of Egypt
known as "the Golden Age,"

59:37.649 --> 59:42.918
which some have suggested dates
back as far as 10500 BC.

59:43.021 --> 59:45.054
So, is it possible

59:45.056 --> 59:50.859
that what we have right here
may be a remnant of that time?

59:50.928 --> 59:54.763
When it comes to dating,
I don't have a response.

59:54.832 --> 59:58.333
NARRATOR: As far
as ancient astronaut theorists

59:58.369 --> 01:00:01.270
like Giorgio Tsoukalos
are concerned,

01:00:01.405 --> 01:00:05.341
the fact that only one
of the 24 sarcophagi found

01:00:05.343 --> 01:00:08.410
in the Serapeum contained
animal remains...

01:00:08.446 --> 01:00:10.746
the same one
that features crude,

01:00:10.782 --> 01:00:12.948
almost graffiti-like,
hieroglyphic carvings...

01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:17.486
is evidence that archaeologists
are mistaken in their belief

01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:20.289
that this magnificent complex
was built

01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:23.692
as a burial site
for sacred bulls.

01:00:23.728 --> 01:00:26.095
It's a huge discrepancy
in workmanship,

01:00:26.197 --> 01:00:29.030
especially with what we've seen

01:00:29.067 --> 01:00:33.835
in other examples of hieroglyphs

01:00:33.871 --> 01:00:37.906
carved or inscribed
on other basalt items.

01:00:37.975 --> 01:00:40.242
It leads me to think

01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:44.780
that whoever inscribed this box
right here...

01:00:44.915 --> 01:00:47.449
they came much, much later.

01:00:47.485 --> 01:00:49.385
I can't tell you for a fact

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.387
that this was made
3,000 years ago.

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:54.590
Till today, there's a debate
on when were these made.

01:00:54.659 --> 01:00:57.393
NARRATOR:
It is Giorgio's belief

01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.295
that not only was
the Serapeum built

01:00:59.397 --> 01:01:01.731
more than 10,000 years ago...

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:05.267
back to the time when the
Great Pyramid was constructed...

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.204
but that it was likely built
to house the remains,

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:13.542
not of bulls, but of giant
extraterrestrial beings.

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:15.344
COLLINS:
It is a fact

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:18.948
that when most of these
gigantic sarcophagi were opened,

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.816
nothing was inside them.

01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:23.018
But in my opinion,

01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:27.055
I think that this acted as some
kind of otherworldly environment

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:31.193
for communication
with the cosmos itself.

01:01:31.195 --> 01:01:35.030
CHILDRESS: These things may well
have been created

01:01:35.032 --> 01:01:36.632
by extraterrestrials.

01:01:36.701 --> 01:01:40.703
Later, the Egyptians
took them over, used them

01:01:40.805 --> 01:01:45.307
as sarcophagi,
perhaps for these bulls.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:50.512
I mean, I find it wild that
this place was even discovered.

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:52.421
And there's probably much more
to be discovered

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.250
here in Saqqâra, and we never
know what we're gonna find.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.518
Absolutely!

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.619
NARRATOR:
Could it be

01:01:57.655 --> 01:02:00.522
that the Serapeum of Saqqâra
was originally built

01:02:00.657 --> 01:02:04.794
as a repository
for extraterrestrial remains?

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.563
But if so,
what happened to them?

01:02:07.632 --> 01:02:11.200
How could they have simply
vanished without a trace?

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.702
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

01:02:13.837 --> 01:02:18.707
one possible answer can be found
by closely examining another

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:24.046
of ancient Egypt's most
compelling artifacts: mummies.

01:02:31.337 --> 01:02:34.204
NARRATOR: In the shadow
of Egypt's majestic pyramids

01:02:34.206 --> 01:02:38.008
and monuments, and beneath
its ever-shifting sands

01:02:38.143 --> 01:02:40.744
lie the tombs and resting places

01:02:40.813 --> 01:02:44.381
of more than one million
human mummies.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:47.551
The bodies,
often thousands of years old,

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:53.891
are so well preserved that most
are still covered in flesh.

01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:58.895
Mummification in ancient Egypt
could be extremely expensive,

01:02:58.964 --> 01:03:01.231
and was a very slow process.

01:03:01.334 --> 01:03:06.503
Families in Egypt would spend
their entire fortune

01:03:06.505 --> 01:03:08.972
mummifying the dead.

01:03:09.075 --> 01:03:13.710
But why were the Egyptians
mummifying people

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:17.314
and going through these
elaborate mummification rituals?

01:03:17.383 --> 01:03:19.049
It would seem to be

01:03:19.184 --> 01:03:23.120
that they did want to preserve
the body as best they could.

01:03:25.358 --> 01:03:27.858
NARRATOR: The ancient Egyptians
went to great lengths

01:03:27.927 --> 01:03:31.528
to keep the bodies of their dead
from decomposing.

01:03:31.597 --> 01:03:35.866
All organs, except
for the heart, were extracted.

01:03:35.935 --> 01:03:39.703
The brain was pulled out
through the nose.

01:03:39.705 --> 01:03:42.606
All moisture was removed
from the body.

01:03:42.608 --> 01:03:47.010
And hundreds of yards of linen
were used to wrap the deceased,

01:03:47.146 --> 01:03:50.080
all in preparation
for what the Egyptians believed

01:03:50.215 --> 01:03:52.949
to be the afterlife.

01:03:53.018 --> 01:03:55.619
Giorgio, this is it.

01:03:55.621 --> 01:03:57.421
The Royal Mummies Room.

01:03:57.556 --> 01:03:59.756
NARRATOR:
Here in the Royal Mummies Room

01:03:59.759 --> 01:04:01.625
at the Cairo museum,

01:04:01.694 --> 01:04:03.060
ancient astronaut theorist

01:04:03.062 --> 01:04:04.762
- Giorgio Tsoukalos...
- This is amazing.

01:04:04.864 --> 01:04:07.765
...and Egyptologist
Ramy Romany have come

01:04:07.867 --> 01:04:10.634
to examine some peculiarities
concerning mummification

01:04:10.736 --> 01:04:15.038
that have been largely hidden
from the public.

01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:18.509
So, tell me about mummification.

01:04:18.644 --> 01:04:22.179
Why did the ancient Egyptians
mummify their dead?

01:04:22.281 --> 01:04:25.249
Mummification
was extremely important

01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:27.717
for ancient Egyptians

01:04:27.753 --> 01:04:31.388
because the concept
of their religion.

01:04:31.457 --> 01:04:33.924
They believed that
if they can perfectly preserve

01:04:33.993 --> 01:04:35.525
their body as is,

01:04:35.594 --> 01:04:37.527
then they can live for eternity

01:04:37.596 --> 01:04:40.330
in a different dimension
in the underworld,

01:04:40.399 --> 01:04:41.798
in the world of the dead.

01:04:41.801 --> 01:04:43.534
That's very interesting.

01:04:43.636 --> 01:04:46.804
The mummies that we see in here,
I mean, it is extraordinary,

01:04:46.939 --> 01:04:49.072
the level of preservation.

01:04:49.108 --> 01:04:51.008
Absolutely. Look.
You can see every bit.

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:53.277
You can see his teeth

01:04:53.279 --> 01:04:54.489
- are still in there.
- (laughs): Yeah.

01:04:54.513 --> 01:04:55.779
ROMANY:
The queen there.

01:04:55.781 --> 01:04:57.414
You can see her hair
is still there.

01:04:57.516 --> 01:05:00.083
Every toe.
The toenails are still there.

01:05:00.186 --> 01:05:01.585
And I have to tell you,

01:05:01.587 --> 01:05:05.222
big parts of it
still is a mystery to us.

01:05:05.324 --> 01:05:10.427
What were the ingredients needed
in order to mummify a body?

01:05:10.562 --> 01:05:13.697
The first
and most important ingredient

01:05:13.699 --> 01:05:18.101
in the process of mummification
is the natron salt.

01:05:18.103 --> 01:05:22.105
The mummy would have to stay
in the natron salt

01:05:22.174 --> 01:05:23.841
for a couple of weeks

01:05:23.943 --> 01:05:26.509
before it can go through
the rest of the process.

01:05:26.545 --> 01:05:28.912
It's the driest salt there is.

01:05:28.981 --> 01:05:33.183
'Cause the main reason
they want that salt

01:05:33.285 --> 01:05:34.785
is to take the liquid out

01:05:34.787 --> 01:05:37.721
as fast as possible
from the mummy

01:05:37.823 --> 01:05:39.723
before the mummy
starts rottening,

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:43.260
to keep every part of it safe
with all the liquids out.

01:05:43.362 --> 01:05:47.197
The one thing that's always
fascinated me is the idea

01:05:47.299 --> 01:05:49.199
that they were mummified

01:05:49.201 --> 01:05:53.070
in order to live on
in the afterlife.

01:05:53.172 --> 01:05:56.339
And the afterlife,
with all the religious symbology

01:05:56.375 --> 01:06:00.010
that exists in ancient Egypt,
always had something to do

01:06:00.079 --> 01:06:01.812
with the stars.

01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:05.282
Now, if you look at the future,

01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:07.551
one way of reaching
another planet

01:06:07.686 --> 01:06:09.553
would be if we put ourselves

01:06:09.688 --> 01:06:12.989
into a state
of suspended animation.

01:06:13.058 --> 01:06:14.424
And we would do this

01:06:14.493 --> 01:06:18.428
by being inside pods
sleeping like this.

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.364
And so my question
is whether or not

01:06:21.433 --> 01:06:24.968
the ancient Egyptians
witnessed something like this

01:06:25.037 --> 01:06:26.770
and didn't understand

01:06:26.839 --> 01:06:30.440
that it was someone going back
to their planet,

01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:32.175
putting on the suit,

01:06:32.177 --> 01:06:34.645
getting inside
their sarcophagus,

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.979
which looks like a pod,

01:06:36.015 --> 01:06:37.814
or the pod looks
like a sarcophagus.

01:06:37.883 --> 01:06:40.450
So it's not symbolic at all,

01:06:40.452 --> 01:06:43.519
but in fact
they witnessed something

01:06:43.556 --> 01:06:47.657
and misinterpreted it
as a spiritual event.

01:06:47.726 --> 01:06:50.861
The origin of it
may have been rooted

01:06:50.863 --> 01:06:53.396
in misunderstood technology.

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:56.800
But I think there is a point
to be made here.

01:06:56.902 --> 01:06:59.736
You are assuming
that they believed

01:06:59.772 --> 01:07:01.805
that this was symbolic,

01:07:01.907 --> 01:07:03.807
but for them it wasn't symbolic.

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:06.209
TSOUKALOS: So, this raises
an interesting point

01:07:06.345 --> 01:07:08.545
that only mummies
of the New Kingdom so far

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.948
have been found
and no one in the Old Kingdom.

01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:14.051
So where have they gone?

01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:19.422
NARRATOR:
Until recently, it was believed

01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:21.558
that mummification began
in Egypt

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.761
somewhere around 2600 BC.

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:29.566
But in 2014,
evidence was discovered

01:07:29.635 --> 01:07:32.502
that suggested
the practice could have begun

01:07:32.571 --> 01:07:34.704
thousands of years earlier,

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.108
long before the time
of the pharaohs.

01:07:38.177 --> 01:07:41.178
But were the bodies of the dead
being preserved

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.314
for a future in the afterlife

01:07:44.416 --> 01:07:48.752
or for some other
even more incredible purpose?

01:07:48.854 --> 01:07:53.056
I think the whole process
of mummification and burial

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:56.459
was, instead of a sacred thing,

01:07:56.495 --> 01:07:58.395
a very practical method

01:07:58.464 --> 01:08:01.531
of harvesting the energy
of the Earth

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.534
to charge the body of the mummy

01:08:04.603 --> 01:08:06.269
and transforming the whole thing

01:08:06.338 --> 01:08:10.473
into a very high-power
capacitor.

01:08:10.542 --> 01:08:13.276
NARRATOR:
A power capacitor?

01:08:13.312 --> 01:08:15.812
Transforming the bodies
of dead pharaohs

01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:18.548
into sources of energy?

01:08:18.651 --> 01:08:22.653
Could such an audacious theory
be scientifically possible?

01:08:24.156 --> 01:08:27.423
CHIRIAC:
Why do they use natron salt

01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:31.161
that comes from dry bed lakes

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:32.562
instead of marine salt

01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:36.166
from the Mediterranean Sea
or the Red Sea?

01:08:36.234 --> 01:08:39.234
Natron salt is very alkaline.

01:08:39.304 --> 01:08:42.772
The body will become alkaline.

01:08:42.841 --> 01:08:45.908
And they were covering it
with linen,

01:08:45.911 --> 01:08:48.712
with natural resins.

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:51.548
Now, that resin is acidic.

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:54.584
In contact
with the alkaline body,

01:08:54.653 --> 01:08:58.488
you will have some sort
of an ion exchanger.

01:09:01.527 --> 01:09:03.526
When we look
at the mummification process

01:09:03.595 --> 01:09:07.397
and the tombs of the pharaoh,
we find granite tombs.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:11.301
The ancient Egyptians referred
to granite as a fire stone.

01:09:11.403 --> 01:09:15.337
They called it that because it's
loaded with pure quartz crystal,

01:09:15.374 --> 01:09:18.975
and crystal holds vibration.

01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:21.944
When we combine this
with the massive amounts

01:09:21.947 --> 01:09:23.947
of gold
and other precious jewels

01:09:24.015 --> 01:09:26.750
that were used
in the mummification process

01:09:26.885 --> 01:09:28.618
and placed upon the body,

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.287
you begin to wonder:
were they trying to trigger

01:09:31.356 --> 01:09:33.488
some kind
of a electrical process

01:09:33.524 --> 01:09:37.594
that somehow
transmuted the body?

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:42.031
Maybe we're dealing with some
other sort of technology here

01:09:42.067 --> 01:09:45.301
or an ancient civilization
on Earth.

01:09:45.304 --> 01:09:48.371
They were making the body
to vibrate,

01:09:48.372 --> 01:09:50.640
creating some sort of energy.

01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:55.178
Soul booster, if you want,
of the deceased.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.180
HENRY: The reason why
the ancient Egyptians

01:09:57.216 --> 01:09:59.382
mummified their pharaohs

01:09:59.418 --> 01:10:02.252
is that they were
going to self-create

01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:05.856
a new light body,

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:11.327
a new vehicle for the pharaohs'
consciousness to survive.

01:10:11.396 --> 01:10:13.396
So effectively,
they could continue

01:10:13.398 --> 01:10:16.532
on their journey
into the stars.

01:10:16.568 --> 01:10:19.602
Our cutting-edge
artificial intelligence

01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:22.338
and sci-fi-like desire

01:10:22.407 --> 01:10:24.173
to upload our consciousness into

01:10:24.175 --> 01:10:26.209
is an absolute
and pure reflection

01:10:26.245 --> 01:10:28.879
of the ancient Egyptian
mummification concept,

01:10:29.014 --> 01:10:32.081
this idea that we can create
a new vehicle for ourselves,

01:10:32.117 --> 01:10:34.284
a non-biological entity

01:10:34.286 --> 01:10:37.554
that will enable us
to live as immortal beings.

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:42.492
NARRATOR: Could it be that with
the process of mummification,

01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:45.162
the ancient Egyptians
were trying to recreate

01:10:45.264 --> 01:10:47.697
a process that had been used
in Egypt

01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:50.767
thousands of years earlier

01:10:50.869 --> 01:10:53.703
at a time when
the land was inhabited

01:10:53.705 --> 01:10:57.707
by an advanced,
extraterrestrial civilization?

01:10:57.776 --> 01:11:01.510
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

01:11:01.547 --> 01:11:05.314
and suggest
that a direct similarity exists

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:07.316
between the burial practices

01:11:07.352 --> 01:11:09.385
performed
on the Egyptian pharaohs

01:11:09.454 --> 01:11:11.121
and the original purpose

01:11:11.256 --> 01:11:14.457
of the stone sarcophagi
in the Serapeum:

01:11:14.459 --> 01:11:16.793
the conversion
of physical beings

01:11:16.928 --> 01:11:19.829
into pure energy.

01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:22.531
They also believe
further evidence

01:11:22.568 --> 01:11:25.268
of extraterrestrial activity
in ancient Egypt

01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:28.471
can be found
by examining the hieroglyphs

01:11:28.574 --> 01:11:32.075
carved into the walls of one
of the country's most elaborate

01:11:32.177 --> 01:11:35.679
and intriguing sacred sites.

01:11:41.234 --> 01:11:42.967
NARRATOR:
Was Egypt the destination

01:11:43.069 --> 01:11:47.638
for Earth's earliest
extraterrestrial visitors?

01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:52.010
And, if so, were the ancient
pyramids, tombs and temples

01:11:52.012 --> 01:11:54.578
actually built by
ancient aliens,

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:58.349
or were they, perhaps,
inspired by them?

01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:04.355
To find the answer,
Egyptologist, Ramy Romany,

01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:07.692
has invited ancient astronaut
theorist and researcher,

01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:10.561
Andrew Collins,
to join him on a visit

01:12:10.564 --> 01:12:13.964
to one of the most impressive
and best-preserved shrines

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.634
in Egypt... the Temple of Edfu,

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:22.574
located on the west bank of the
Nile, 465 miles south of Cairo.

01:12:24.177 --> 01:12:25.443
Look at this temple.

01:12:25.512 --> 01:12:27.378
This is, like,
my most favorite facade

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.581
in all of the temples
of ancient Egypt.

01:12:29.716 --> 01:12:32.183
NARRATOR: According to
mainstream archaeologists,

01:12:32.252 --> 01:12:34.585
Edfu is believed to have
been built

01:12:34.588 --> 01:12:39.457
sometime between 237 and 57 BC.

01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:42.627
It is dedicated to
the falcon-headed god Horus,

01:12:42.696 --> 01:12:45.597
the son of Osiris and Isis.

01:12:45.732 --> 01:12:48.099
ROMANY: This temple was
one of the last temples

01:12:48.101 --> 01:12:52.203
that was ever built in ancient
Egypt, during the Roman times.

01:12:52.272 --> 01:12:54.205
When they built that temple,
they were like,

01:12:54.207 --> 01:12:55.974
"We want to preserve
the stories,

01:12:56.076 --> 01:12:59.544
"so let's gather all the
mythology of ancient Egypt

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:02.513
and try to put it
in one temple."

01:13:02.582 --> 01:13:06.417
It took 150 years
to make this happen.

01:13:06.486 --> 01:13:08.552
And then finally,
we had the book

01:13:08.588 --> 01:13:10.021
of ancient Egyptian mythology.

01:13:10.156 --> 01:13:12.957
It's right in front of us
on all these walls.

01:13:13.026 --> 01:13:18.296
Every wall is absolutely covered
in hieroglyphs and images,

01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:21.699
not only of the foundation
of ancient Egypt

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:26.504
and the first temple, but also
how the world came into being,

01:13:26.606 --> 01:13:28.573
how Egypt came into being,

01:13:28.675 --> 01:13:32.644
how the universe was essentially
founded in the first place.

01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:36.447
I mean, there's just
so much here.

01:13:36.516 --> 01:13:38.716
NARRATOR:
The most sacred part of Edfu,

01:13:38.851 --> 01:13:41.986
the holy of holies,
is its inner sanctum,

01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:45.723
featuring a 12-foot-tall
granite stone.

01:13:47.627 --> 01:13:49.594
ROMANY:
This is it right here.

01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:51.195
This is how it all began.

01:13:51.297 --> 01:13:54.866
Every symbol, every text,
every little drawing in here

01:13:55.001 --> 01:13:58.602
represents the most sacred thing
for ancient Egyptians.

01:13:58.638 --> 01:14:02.073
The question that humans now
still ask themselves:

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:05.609
How did it all began?
What created us?

01:14:05.679 --> 01:14:06.811
Every religion talks about it.

01:14:06.813 --> 01:14:08.946
Scientist tries to figure out.

01:14:08.948 --> 01:14:12.617
Ancient Egyptians had an answer,
and it was right there.

01:14:15.355 --> 01:14:18.622
Right on top of this is
the pyramidion.

01:14:18.658 --> 01:14:21.025
That pyramidion is
the primeval mound

01:14:21.127 --> 01:14:24.162
that appeared in the middle
of the marshes,

01:14:24.164 --> 01:14:27.365
where all the gods came and
landed on for the first time

01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:29.767
to start creating humanity.

01:14:29.836 --> 01:14:33.771
This is the beginning
of humanity.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.376
What we have here is a focus
of all of these chapels,

01:14:38.511 --> 01:14:40.845
finishing with-with this
incredible structure

01:14:40.847 --> 01:14:43.715
pointing towards the north.

01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:46.584
It's actually pointing towards

01:14:46.653 --> 01:14:49.253
the origins
of the gods themselves.

01:14:49.322 --> 01:14:50.988
It's a way of projecting

01:14:51.057 --> 01:14:55.526
the soul back to its place of
origin amongst the stars.

01:14:55.595 --> 01:14:57.075
There's another piece
of evidence here

01:14:57.196 --> 01:14:58.462
that you might like.

01:14:58.531 --> 01:15:01.933
This is the boat,

01:15:01.935 --> 01:15:05.136
or a symbol of the boat that
they believed the gods came on

01:15:05.205 --> 01:15:10.074
to the first primeval stone.

01:15:10.176 --> 01:15:13.478
So it's all here
in this sanctuary,

01:15:13.613 --> 01:15:16.080
the whole story
of humanity's beginning,

01:15:16.082 --> 01:15:17.815
you know,
its place in the stars,

01:15:17.917 --> 01:15:20.351
and how it arrived here
in the first place.

01:15:20.453 --> 01:15:24.689
This, to me, strongly suggests
that they were aware

01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:27.758
that our origins are found
amongst the stars.

01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:29.960
I think probably
the answer is yes.

01:15:30.029 --> 01:15:32.362
Or could it just simply be

01:15:32.399 --> 01:15:35.566
humans trying
to make religions explain

01:15:35.568 --> 01:15:37.502
what science can't explain?

01:15:37.604 --> 01:15:39.370
But I don't think
it's about religion.

01:15:39.505 --> 01:15:41.172
This is about cosmology,

01:15:41.274 --> 01:15:43.441
an ancient cosmology

01:15:43.443 --> 01:15:45.123
that was believed by
the ancient Egyptians,

01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:48.646
and a cosmology that we're now
beginning to understand

01:15:48.715 --> 01:15:50.781
for the first time,
within science,

01:15:50.784 --> 01:15:53.851
whether it be to do with
astronomy, astrophysics,

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.587
or quantum existence.

01:15:56.623 --> 01:16:00.258
NARRATOR:
Are the ancient hieroglyphs...

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.192
carefully inscribed
on the granite stone

01:16:02.228 --> 01:16:03.928
at the Temple of Edfu...

01:16:03.997 --> 01:16:07.731
merely the fanciful notions
of ancient Egyptian priests,

01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:11.702
or could they be based on
actual historical events?

01:16:13.506 --> 01:16:16.674
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:19.276
they believe that
extraterrestrials first came

01:16:19.312 --> 01:16:22.346
to Egypt in a pyramid-shaped
spacecraft

01:16:22.482 --> 01:16:24.882
that was later referred to in
the Pyramid Texts

01:16:24.918 --> 01:16:26.750
as the Benben stone.

01:16:26.786 --> 01:16:29.620
But once here,
they may have used

01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:31.756
an even more incredible
technology

01:16:31.858 --> 01:16:34.324
to travel to the stars and back:

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.762
the so-called Ship of Eternity.

01:16:38.798 --> 01:16:41.632
HENRY:
The story here is that Osiris,

01:16:41.634 --> 01:16:44.402
the god of resurrection,
was cut into pieces.

01:16:46.372 --> 01:16:51.174
The head of Osiris
was found at Abydos.

01:16:51.211 --> 01:16:55.179
When we look at the hieroglyph
for the head of Osiris,

01:16:55.314 --> 01:16:59.283
it clearly resembles an
electrical transformer.

01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:07.791
On the opposite wall, we see
the same device attached

01:17:07.861 --> 01:17:11.796
to what is referred to as the
Ark of the Millions of Years,

01:17:11.798 --> 01:17:13.664
the Ship of Eternity.

01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:17.000
The pyramid texts are replete
with stories

01:17:17.036 --> 01:17:20.738
of the pharaohs flying through
the cosmos

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.808
on the Ship of Eternity,
which they portrayed

01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.410
on the walls of the temples
as looking exactly like

01:17:26.479 --> 01:17:29.747
the way modern science portrays
a wormhole.

01:17:29.816 --> 01:17:33.017
The ancient Egyptians believed
that the human body

01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:36.554
could be transformed into
a light being form

01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:38.789
that matched that of the gods.

01:17:38.892 --> 01:17:42.393
And so, we have to ask,
is this device some kind

01:17:42.495 --> 01:17:46.297
of a transformational device
that could take the human body,

01:17:46.366 --> 01:17:49.433
turn it into
a light being form, perhaps,

01:17:49.535 --> 01:17:52.503
that could then travel through
a wormhole

01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:54.171
to a distant star system?

01:17:54.207 --> 01:17:56.107
Orion, for example.

01:17:56.109 --> 01:18:00.511
NARRATOR: Does the
Ship of Eternity represent

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:03.648
a star gate through which
extraterrestrials...

01:18:03.783 --> 01:18:05.716
and perhaps even humans...

01:18:05.785 --> 01:18:09.286
traveled instantaneously to
other parts of the universe?

01:18:09.355 --> 01:18:12.990
Perhaps even back to their
home planet located somewhere

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:15.559
in the constellation of Orion?

01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:20.531
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.670
and they suggest that such a
device may still exist today

01:18:25.805 --> 01:18:28.739
hidden within a recently
discovered void

01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:32.343
inside the Great Pyramid.

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:40.849
NARRATOR:
An ancient Hebrew text

01:18:40.918 --> 01:18:44.186
from the 3rd century BC
entitled <i> Exagoge,</i>

01:18:44.288 --> 01:18:45.854
attributed to the poet

01:18:45.857 --> 01:18:48.790
and playwright known as
Ezekiel the Tragedian,

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:52.528
tells the story of a strange
encounter Moses had

01:18:52.663 --> 01:18:55.264
while on Mount Sinai.

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:59.334
Moses comes upon a noble being
who's sitting on a throne.

01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:02.804
This noble being invites Moses

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.940
to sit on the throne,
and when he does so,

01:19:05.009 --> 01:19:08.110
this noble being gives him
a crown and a scepter.

01:19:10.147 --> 01:19:15.984
Suddenly, Moses finds himself
looking at the Earth from space.

01:19:16.053 --> 01:19:18.820
TSOUKALOS: It actually gives
the description.

01:19:18.856 --> 01:19:22.291
"I looked forth upon the earth's
wide circle...

01:19:22.393 --> 01:19:26.562
Then at my feet, behold,
a thousand stars."

01:19:26.664 --> 01:19:29.365
So we have to look at these
ancient stories

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.301
and wonder what's described.

01:19:32.403 --> 01:19:35.104
How is it possible that
you put on a crown

01:19:35.239 --> 01:19:37.573
and all of a sudden
you're in space?

01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:40.308
NARRATOR:
According to the Hebrew Bible,

01:19:40.344 --> 01:19:43.846
Moses was raised as a nobleman
in ancient Egypt,

01:19:43.848 --> 01:19:46.048
and as the adopted son
and brother

01:19:46.183 --> 01:19:48.183
of two powerful pharaohs.

01:19:48.219 --> 01:19:51.519
Is it possible that when he led
the Israelites

01:19:51.555 --> 01:19:53.589
on their Exodus into the desert,

01:19:53.591 --> 01:19:58.527
he was already in possession of
secret extraterrestrial devices,

01:19:58.596 --> 01:20:02.998
devices that would be thousands
of years ahead of his time?

01:20:03.067 --> 01:20:06.201
JASON MARTELL: Today, through
augmented reality and VR,

01:20:06.237 --> 01:20:08.337
we can see that our
technological advances

01:20:08.339 --> 01:20:11.406
can actually extend someone
into a whole new environment

01:20:11.442 --> 01:20:13.475
by placing these devices
on their head.

01:20:13.544 --> 01:20:17.012
It's very possible that some of
these ancient devices,

01:20:17.048 --> 01:20:19.014
constructed for the pharaoh,

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.016
were actually extending
their consciousness

01:20:21.052 --> 01:20:23.051
to another physical location.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.887
Or possibly project
his physical body,

01:20:25.957 --> 01:20:29.458
like a star gate,
to some other location.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.892
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

01:20:30.962 --> 01:20:33.428
that the biblical account
of a throne...

01:20:33.464 --> 01:20:36.565
one that transported Moses
to the stars...

01:20:36.634 --> 01:20:40.502
is directly connected
to Dr. Giulio Magli's theory

01:20:40.637 --> 01:20:44.306
that the recently discovered
void inside the Great Pyramid

01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:47.109
could contain
some sort of sacred

01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:50.178
metallic transportation device?

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.448
And if so,
could it be the same object

01:20:53.484 --> 01:20:55.917
that the ancient Egyptians
referred to

01:20:55.987 --> 01:20:58.087
as the Ship of Eternity?

01:20:58.189 --> 01:21:03.325
For ancient astronaut theorists,
the answer is a profound yes,

01:21:03.427 --> 01:21:06.061
and they believe that
the ultimate evidence

01:21:06.063 --> 01:21:13.001
of Earth's extraterrestrial past
may be closer than ever before.

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:15.337
This place, to me,
is ground zero

01:21:15.439 --> 01:21:20.676
for all of the theories
that I have investigated.

01:21:20.778 --> 01:21:23.912
And actually, my resolve
has strengthened

01:21:23.914 --> 01:21:30.019
in taking a secondary and a
tertiary look at ancient Egypt,

01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:32.621
to look at even more evidence,

01:21:32.623 --> 01:21:35.357
because I think that's
incredibly important.

01:21:35.459 --> 01:21:38.827
What I've learned as well is
that just the fact that you,

01:21:38.962 --> 01:21:43.766
and hopefully others,
are also open-minded enough

01:21:43.901 --> 01:21:46.635
to debate and discuss
the theories,

01:21:46.704 --> 01:21:48.704
which is extremely important,
in my opinion.

01:21:48.839 --> 01:21:51.639
That's how science
actually works.

01:21:51.675 --> 01:21:56.044
Absolutely. Look, I agree
that many of the ancient things

01:21:56.047 --> 01:21:58.780
are rooted in symbolism.

01:21:58.849 --> 01:22:00.449
However, my question is always

01:22:00.551 --> 01:22:04.386
how or where
did the symbolism originate?

01:22:04.455 --> 01:22:09.258
Many of the ancient structure
were built in honor of the gods,

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.127
but my question is why?

01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:15.597
And where did it begin?
And, above all, how?

01:22:15.699 --> 01:22:18.667
- How was the religion inspired?
- Yes.

01:22:18.736 --> 01:22:20.201
What inspired the religion?

01:22:20.237 --> 01:22:22.471
- Yes.
- And it's a great question to have.

01:22:22.573 --> 01:22:24.239
And I don't have
an answer for it.

01:22:24.308 --> 01:22:28.276
- We are at a crossroads...
- Yes.

01:22:28.345 --> 01:22:31.079
...that is about to change
the future.

01:22:31.148 --> 01:22:36.418
I think we're about to enter
a new era of archaeotechnology.

01:22:36.487 --> 01:22:39.888
And, when archaeology
and technology mix together,

01:22:40.023 --> 01:22:46.561
I think the future of Egyptology
will be fascinating.

01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:52.367
I mean, think how much, how much
stuff is under the sands

01:22:52.403 --> 01:22:54.570
- just right in front of you, right here.
- Yes.

01:22:54.572 --> 01:22:57.706
I 100% agree.

01:22:57.775 --> 01:22:59.842
I argue that perhaps
the ancient Egyptians

01:22:59.944 --> 01:23:03.111
had access to sophisticated
technology.

01:23:03.114 --> 01:23:06.781
So, the fact that we today are
discovering ancient sites

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:10.652
by means of modern technology,

01:23:10.754 --> 01:23:13.989
that, to me, is the present
meeting the past,

01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:18.327
and the past meeting the present
and the future, of course.

01:23:19.797 --> 01:23:21.830
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

01:23:21.899 --> 01:23:25.000
the mysteries of the early
Egyptians are perhaps

01:23:25.069 --> 01:23:29.738
best understood as an attempt
by them to replicate behavior

01:23:29.807 --> 01:23:31.874
that was practiced
by their ancestors

01:23:32.009 --> 01:23:33.542
thousands of years earlier,

01:23:33.644 --> 01:23:36.344
when the region served
as the center

01:23:36.413 --> 01:23:40.182
of extraterrestrial activity
on our planet.

01:23:42.286 --> 01:23:45.687
They also believe that new,
cutting-edge technologies,

01:23:45.789 --> 01:23:48.690
like the one used to discover
the mysterious void

01:23:48.825 --> 01:23:50.826
inside the Great Pyramid,

01:23:50.928 --> 01:23:54.396
will be instrumental
in proving their theory.

01:23:55.799 --> 01:24:01.103
For them, the answers exist
all around us.

01:24:04.008 --> 01:24:07.876
And once we discover the truth,

01:24:08.011 --> 01:24:11.980
humankind will be ready
to realize

01:24:12.049 --> 01:24:14.783
its ultimate destiny.
