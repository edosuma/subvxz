00:04.572 --> 00:05.337
My best friend
is suffering.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.589
You're bleeding.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.840
[Simon]  <i> Previously</i>

[Jace]  <i> The vamps</i>
<i> broke the Accords.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.777
They kidnapped a mundie,
that's a big no-no.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.445
[gasps]

00:13.447 --> 00:15.781
Isn't this the wrong time
to be antagonizing the Clave?

00:15.783 --> 00:18.484
She who controls
the Mortal Cup,
controls the Shadow World.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.186
Shouldn't you be
teaching me to fight
vampires or something?

00:21.188 --> 00:22.454
So how would you get in?

00:22.456 --> 00:23.622
How would you?

00:23.624 --> 00:24.790
[chuckles]

00:24.792 --> 00:27.292
They're in the building.
Stop them.

00:29.797 --> 00:30.863
I killed him.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.331
He was already dead.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.967
If you would all
just follow me.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.468
Go! Go! Go!

00:36.470 --> 00:37.903
[Raphael] Go! Take him!

Hey.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.433
It's okay, I'm here.
You're safe.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.735
[breathing heavily]
Jace...

01:09.737 --> 01:11.236
What?

01:12.606 --> 01:13.839
[Simon] You all right?

01:13.841 --> 01:17.109
You still seem...
kind of freaked.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.879
[exhales] Simon.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.448
Hey.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.616
I got you.
You're okay.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.452
Must have been one
hell of a nightmare.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.253
[exhales]
You have no idea.

01:29.356 --> 01:33.092
I was strapped to
this piece of furniture
and my mom was there.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.861
She kept telling
this guy to protect me,

01:35.863 --> 01:38.697
but then he reached
his hand into my skull
and ripped out my brain.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.566
Hello, Freddy Krueger.
[sighs]

01:40.568 --> 01:42.534
Tell me about it.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.403
[inhales] What are
you doing here anyway?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.472
Shouldn't you be
in the infirmary?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.474
Uh, I just...

01:48.476 --> 01:49.808
really needed to see you.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.912
I am so sorry that
my messed up life
put you in danger.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.047
I'm fine.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.882
No, if those
vampires hurt you...

01:56.884 --> 01:59.251
I couldn't
live with myself.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.887
You're all
I've got left.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.057
Don't get me wrong,
I'm totally grateful that
your friends got me out

02:05.059 --> 02:07.059
before the vampires
drained me
like a Big Gulp.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.227
[chuckles]

02:08.229 --> 02:09.461
But...

02:11.065 --> 02:14.399
How well do you
know this Jace guy?
Can you trust him?

02:14.401 --> 02:15.834
I think so.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.771
I mean, he saved
my life... and yours.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.573
True.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.475
But I was thinking...

02:24.778 --> 02:26.745
all of this craziness
started the minute

02:26.747 --> 02:28.947
you bumped into him
at Pandemonium.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.682
You think that's
just a coincidence?

02:30.684 --> 02:33.018
Honestly, I don't even know
what to think anymore.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.155
All I know is I have to
get my memories back.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.425
I need to know
who I really am.
Maybe... [inhales]

02:40.427 --> 02:42.861
Maybe I saw where my mom
hid the Cup, and...

02:42.863 --> 02:45.130
and if I could
just remember...

02:45.132 --> 02:46.298
I could save her.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.500
I just... I wanna put
all of this behind me.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.037
[stammering] But I
don't know this world.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.606
I don't even know where
to start looking. I'm...

02:55.643 --> 02:56.942
I'm just lost.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.777
Hey... Okay.

02:58.779 --> 03:02.548
Look, start with
what we know, okay?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.082
We know that dreams
are remnants of memories.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.451
Right. Yeah.
You saw your mom
in the nightmare,

03:06.453 --> 03:08.287
before the guy was
reaching into your brain.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.123
Yeah, she...
She called him Magnus.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.891
I mean, it's completely
random, I never--
Magnus Bane?

03:14.128 --> 03:15.961
Maybe.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.229
Why? How do you
know that name?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.463
I heard it
from the vampire.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.532
[chuckles] You know,
the shockingly
hot one, it was...

03:21.635 --> 03:23.168
[stammers] Sorry,
uh, Camille...

03:23.170 --> 03:25.237
She was super pissed
at this Magnus Bane guy

03:25.239 --> 03:27.472
when I told her that
someone took your memories.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.908
[chuckling] Simon!
Simon, you're amazing!

03:29.910 --> 03:31.977
You've just...
You've given me
my first solid lead.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.078
I did?
Yeah.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.647
Awesome. Wait,
where are you going?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.983
I have to find Jace
and tell him
about Magnus Bane.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.284
Oh.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.254
What would I do
without you?

03:47.995 --> 03:51.363
Really? Again?

03:51.365 --> 03:52.998
I'm such an idiot.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.007
Oh, God.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.180
[laughs]

04:09.516 --> 04:10.916
[gasps]

04:16.624 --> 04:17.789
I gotta get out of here.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.758
Gotta get out of here...

04:29.770 --> 04:32.604
Jace, I need to
talk to you about
something, it's really...

04:33.374 --> 04:35.040
Oh...

04:35.042 --> 04:37.609
Sorry, I... [laughs] I really
should've knocked first.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.444
Let me just grab a shirt.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.779
Yeah.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.114
[chuckles] Good idea.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.917
So, what's up?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.052
You wanted to see me?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.320
Yeah, um...

04:48.322 --> 04:51.223
I need you to tell me
everything you know
about Magnus Bane.

04:51.225 --> 04:54.059
Magnus Bane is
the High Warlock
of Brooklyn, why?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.560
Because that vampire,
Camille, practically

04:55.562 --> 04:56.962
accused him of
stealing my memories.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.531
Where did you hear that?

04:59.532 --> 05:01.565
When Simon told Camille
someone took my memories
back at the Hotel DuMort,

05:01.568 --> 05:02.668
she blamed Magnus Bane.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.470
Right, and you believe
your little mundane friend?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.005
I believe Simon.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.908
Besides, I keep
having these dreams

05:09.910 --> 05:11.677
where this Magnus guy
is with my mom

05:11.679 --> 05:13.445
and she tells
him to protect me.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.180
You mean, like,
memory fragments?

05:15.182 --> 05:17.582
Yeah, but... [sighs]
They're not making sense.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.584
Whatever, why didn't you
tell me about that?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.586
Because, Jace,
practically a week ago

05:21.588 --> 05:23.622
I didn't even know
this world existed.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.424
Let alone that
Magnus is real.

05:25.426 --> 05:29.428
Magnus' magic is so powerful,
he can invade even
the Silent Brothers.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.763
If he's the warlock
that took your memories...

05:31.765 --> 05:33.298
he could be
the key to everything.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.501
People are risking
their lives to help me
get my memories back.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.305
But there might not
be anything there.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.774
I might not remember
anything that will lead
to the Mortal Cup...

05:42.776 --> 05:44.009
or my mom.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.777
[inhales] Clary...

05:45.779 --> 05:47.479
Believe me when I tell you

05:47.481 --> 05:49.548
that finding your
memories is our only

05:49.550 --> 05:51.616
shot at getting
the Mortal Cup back.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.652
[whispers] But--
Look at me...

05:53.654 --> 05:55.954
I'm willing to take
that chance on you.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.857
Jace, I need you.
The mundie's leaving.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.125
Simon? He can't leave.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.293
He can and he is.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.128
Unless you wanna tie him down
and restrain him?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.863
[scoffs]
I have to stop him.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.999
Izzy, go wake
Alec and Hodge.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.535
We might have a lead
on the Mortal Cup.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.438
[sighs] How can one mundane
be such a pain in my ass?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.376
[Clary] Simon,
what are you doing?

06:17.378 --> 06:19.978
I already told Isabelle,
they can't keep
me prisoner here.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.147
Prisoner? Wait, what...
Simon!

06:22.149 --> 06:23.648
Where are you going?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.150
I'm going home, Clary.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.319
And if you haven't
already completely
drunk their Kool-Aid,

06:27.321 --> 06:28.754
then you're coming
with me.
You know I can't.

06:28.756 --> 06:32.324
Yes, you can, it's...
[quietly]
It's not safe here.

06:32.326 --> 06:33.492
[elevator bell dings]

06:33.494 --> 06:36.194
In fact,
this is the safest place
she could possibly be.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.663
You don't get
to talk to me,
Captain America.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.166
Considering I'm the guy
with the weapons,
I get to say what I want.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.901
Okay, come at me, bro!
Oh, yeah?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.403
Yeah!
Hey, what is
your problem?

06:44.405 --> 06:45.670
He's my problem!

06:45.672 --> 06:47.506
[softly] He's just
like Kirk Duplesse
from high school.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.675
Do you remember him?
Total jerk with
the square jaw.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.211
Smelled like body spray,
always bullying people.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.914
Why don't you do
your own homework?
Just once, yeah?

06:59.720 --> 07:00.986
I can take care
of myself.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.624
I'm not saving his ass
a second time--

07:05.626 --> 07:06.858
Really, Jace?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.093
Simon! Hey...

07:08.095 --> 07:10.429
Simon... Hey! Simon.
What?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.197
You were kidnapped
by vampires, okay?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.199
You of all people
should know how dangerous
it is out there.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.867
I'll be fine.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.537
Hey, you're not
the only one
who's in danger.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.906
All right?
If you go home right now,
you're putting your mother,

07:20.908 --> 07:23.041
and your sister,
and even Maureen at risk.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.876
Think about them.
I am thinking about them.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.445
Are you?
Yeah.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.547
Because if
everything you've said
about the Shadow World's true,

07:28.549 --> 07:30.882
they're already in danger,
and I need to be
home to protect them.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.250
Simon...

07:32.252 --> 07:33.585
Come with me.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.254
We can crash at my place.
We can figure all this out.

07:36.256 --> 07:40.258
You have no idea how much
I want to go back to
the way things were.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.561
To be with you
and my mom and--
Clary.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.963
We've had each other's backs
our whole lives.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.399
We've never needed anyone.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.533
[sighs]

07:49.736 --> 07:51.970
Let me help you.
We don't...

07:53.574 --> 07:54.806
We don't need these people.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.974
Simon...

07:56.610 --> 07:58.410
I don't know how to
explain this, okay?

07:58.412 --> 08:01.480
But I think... I think
these are my people.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.551
Message received,
loud and clear.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.054
Simon, wait!

08:10.858 --> 08:12.023
Simon!

08:16.096 --> 08:17.596
[Hodge] Magnus Bane.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.798
He's over 300 years old.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.299
And, as you can see,

08:21.301 --> 08:24.102
he's not exactly shied away
from the pleasures
of every century.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.771
His tastes are
both exquisite...

08:26.773 --> 08:28.607
and quite excessive.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.542
He looks like
the Downworld's
David Guetta.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.010
[Isabelle] Guetta's
already a Downworlder.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.012
Vampire?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.380
Ever seen him
in the daylight?

08:35.382 --> 08:36.681
[Alec] Can you two focus?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.016
This is not a joke.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.818
[Isabelle] Someone
needs to get slayed.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.653
Alec's right.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.823
Now, Magnus is one
of the most powerful
warlocks I've ever known.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.325
He has a deep mistrust
of Shadowhunters.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.294
Well, then why did
he help my mom
remove my memories?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.795
Isn't she a Shadowhunter?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.297
Yes, one of the best.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.399
But "help" might not be
the most accurate word.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.302
Now, did Magnus
provide a service
for Jocelyn?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.703
Perhaps.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.972
But more than likely,
your mother paid

09:00.974 --> 09:02.474
Magnus handsomely
for his magic.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.142
Warlocks usually
require payment

09:04.144 --> 09:05.644
before they help
anyone with anything.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.380
Word from the Clave
is that most of the warlocks
have gone into hiding

09:08.382 --> 09:09.814
since Valentine
began hunting them.

09:09.816 --> 09:13.385
Valentine must be
searching for the warlock,
where did Jocelyn--

09:13.387 --> 09:14.853
[rune searing]

09:14.855 --> 09:17.489
Hodge, your rune.
You okay?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.226
So how do we find Magnus?
[Jace] We don't.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.395
Magnus finds us.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.331
We'll set up a meeting,
somewhere protected.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.999
Lure him out of hiding.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.068
And I know exactly
where we do it.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.875
[Hodge chuckles]

09:36.877 --> 09:38.009
[Jace] A Downworld rave.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.011
Nice, Izzy.
And where'd you get that?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.247
During my surveillance
of the Downworlders.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.182
From what I hear,
Magnus likes to party.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.885
He'll never go for it.
Not with Valentine
trying to kill him.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.853
Of course he will.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.357
He'll blend in.
Hide in plain sight.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.025
I don't know, it's seems--
[Isabelle] Trust me.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.694
If Magnus is
coming out of hiding,

09:55.696 --> 09:57.696
he's going to
one of the biggest
parties of the year.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.265
Never underestimate
Magnus' hedonism.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.601
Or his greed.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.136
Come with me.

10:17.718 --> 10:18.917
Is that real?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.252
[Hodge] A four-karat,
unheated Burmese ruby.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.722
And this necklace
has special meaning
to Magnus Bane

10:23.724 --> 10:27.392
as it was a gift from
him to his then lover,
Camille Belcourt.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.294
What, Camille and
Magnus were lovers?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.162
Warlock gets around.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.567
Magnus bought it in 1857
for the price of
his London townhouse.

10:35.569 --> 10:38.503
Now, the jewel is
enchanted by a spell

10:38.505 --> 10:40.572
that alerts the wearer
to the presence of demons.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.842
[Isabelle] It's so beautiful.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.911
Magnus has longed
to reunite
with this necklace.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.147
Offer it to him.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.416
He might just take the bait.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.985
I'll send Magnus
a fire message
to arrange the meeting.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.656
We have to get to Magnus
before Valentine does.

11:02.029 --> 11:06.031
[Valentine] Why haven't
we found the warlock
to wake Jocelyn?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.500
How is it that my
most effective asset

11:09.269 --> 11:10.835
is the one that's comatose?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.370
[Blackwell]
Sir, I promise--

11:12.372 --> 11:15.340
[shushing] You know what?
Your lips are moving
yet I hear nothing.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.877
Wait a minute,
what's that, hmm?

Scouts from the Clave.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.474
[yells]

11:51.978 --> 11:55.413
The expulsion of the poison
was so powerful that
it killed Pangborn.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.817
[sighs] He was
a loyal Shadowhunter.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.219
Fearless.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.722
Dedicated.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.491
But his death
is for the best.

12:07.994 --> 12:11.079
How so?

12:11.080 --> 12:14.165
When that filthy warlock
tainted Pangborn's
pure Shadowhunter blood,

12:15.202 --> 12:17.268
she turned him
into an abomination.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.706
At least he gave his
life for the cause.

12:21.708 --> 12:25.110
[inhales] Gather
the dead Seelies, hmm?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.980

could be interesting.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.353
[Alaric] Where
the hell have you been?

12:35.355 --> 12:38.523
You're 30 minutes late
and you're not
responding to calls.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.425
Vargas is looking for you.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.361

to take care of.

Ever since your
witnesses wound up dead,

12:54.908 --> 12:56.608

under a microscope.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.877
[quietly] One
wrong move, you're out.
I'm handling it.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.979
No, you're not.
Get your act
together, Luke.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.148

13:03.150 --> 13:04.616
Our people need you
to keep your shield.

13:05.552 --> 13:09.354
If you want me to
get the Cup so badly,
I need to get Clary alone.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.559
[Clary] Jace said
you wanted to see me?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.127
That's right.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.996
What are you wearing
to the Downworlder
party tonight?

13:17.998 --> 13:20.465
I don't know.
I was just thinking
about wearing this.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.734
I don't think so.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.236
No Downworlder
would be
caught dead in that.

[stammers]
I'm sorry. I'm...

19:42.482 --> 19:43.981
It's okay.
I'm really...
Let me just...

19:43.983 --> 19:46.784
Ow! Damn it!

19:46.786 --> 19:48.019
Damn!

19:52.692 --> 19:53.958
I'm bleeding.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.526
Do you have a...

19:55.962 --> 19:57.528
Simon?

19:58.164 --> 19:59.230
Simon?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.233
Simon, are you even
listening to me?

20:32.665 --> 20:35.333
[Jace] Alec and
Izzy are securing
the perimeter.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.901
[Clary] Are you sure
this is a good idea?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.503
Last time we were here,
this place was
crawling with vampires.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.906
Relax, all Downworlders
hang out here.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.441
We just came
on vampire night.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.942
Right.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.578
And when is all this
gonna sound normal to me?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.447
I don't know.
[footsteps approaching]

20:49.449 --> 20:50.581
All clear.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.783
Do you think
red's my color?

20:52.785 --> 20:55.353
Iz, with a body like yours,
everything's your color.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.088
Good point.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.857
Damn, I make this
necklace look so good.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.359
Will you take it off?

21:01.361 --> 21:04.262
I'm certain Magnus Bane
doesn't want drool on his ruby

21:04.264 --> 21:05.429
when we make
the exchange.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.864
You know,
I wouldn't be so sure.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.933
Most men like it when
I admire their jewels.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.935
[Alec] Can you just
give it to Jace?
[Isabelle giggles]

21:10.937 --> 21:13.271
You're such
a buzzkill.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.974
[loud techno playing]

21:22.715 --> 21:25.483
Blend in.
Keep your weapons ready.

21:31.557 --> 21:32.723
Magnus.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.230
Clary Fairchild.

21:39.232 --> 21:41.399
You've grown into
a beautiful young woman.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.234
Magnus Bane.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.902
So you're the one
who stole my memories.

21:44.904 --> 21:48.005
At your mother's request.
She knew the risk.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.411
Show me the jewelry,
Shadowhunter.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.516
Ooh...

21:58.518 --> 22:01.652
Give Clary back her memories,
and you get the jewelry.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.256
I have to confirm
its authenticity.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.100
<i> "Amor verus</i>
<i> numquam moritur."</i>

22:16.102 --> 22:18.436
"True love cannot die."

22:18.438 --> 22:21.472
[sighs] Oh, how I've
missed this jewel.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.940
Now, it's your turn
to pay up.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.945
I wish I could
retrieve your memories,
but I no longer have them.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.514
What? Where are they?

22:31.484 --> 22:33.617
I fed them
to a memory demon
for safekeeping.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.219
And why the hell
would you do that?

22:35.221 --> 22:37.955
To protect Clary
and the Cup.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.857
If Valentine ever
captured me,

22:39.859 --> 22:41.726
he could torture Clary's
memories out of me.

22:41.728 --> 22:42.860
Just like he tortured Dot.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.128
Tortured?

22:44.130 --> 22:45.396
Wait, is Dot okay?

22:46.299 --> 22:47.398
You don't know?

22:50.169 --> 22:51.302
Dot is dead.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.538
What?

22:56.642 --> 22:57.742
How do you know?

22:58.644 --> 23:00.044
I can't feel
her magic anymore.

23:02.648 --> 23:05.316
Valentine killed her
because she would not
betray your mother.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.551
Oh, my God.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.120
Come with me, Clary.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.657
My lair can
offer you protection
no Shadowhunter ever could.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.659
[scoffs]

23:15.661 --> 23:16.927
No!

23:16.929 --> 23:18.529
No, I'm not going
anywhere with you.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.665
Don't be a fool.
Your mother would
want you to live.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.000
Then help me get
my memories back

23:23.002 --> 23:24.335
from whatever demon
you gave them to.

23:24.337 --> 23:26.604
Valentine is
hunting you, too.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.939
And every moment
we're outside
my lair's protection,

23:28.941 --> 23:31.242
is a moment Valentine
gets closer to finding us.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.078
[whooshing]

23:37.216 --> 23:38.349
Come with me.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.588
I won't offer again.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.460
No.

23:49.461 --> 23:50.727
No, I won't hide
from my problems
and neither should you.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.430
[woman] Look out!
[groans]

24:05.545 --> 24:07.445
Who are you?

24:10.216 --> 24:11.615
Magnus, wait!

24:12.952 --> 24:15.453
You're my only hope.
Valentine found us.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.555
I warned your mother
this might happen.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.789
Wait...

24:23.896 --> 24:26.630
The area's secure.
Looks like he was
the only assassin.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.566
He has a Circle rune
on the base of his neck.

24:28.568 --> 24:31.969
They found us.
It's not safe here.
Clary, we have to go.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.140
Clary...

24:38.411 --> 24:39.877
[gasps softly]

24:46.619 --> 24:47.685
Jace.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.454
Clary, we have to move.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.622
I'm catching my breath.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.123
You know what?
This is great.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.259
And not only did
Magnus not get the girl

24:55.261 --> 24:57.595
her memories back,
he took the necklace.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.762
This is fantastic--

24:58.764 --> 25:00.431
[Jace] Alec, the girl...

25:00.433 --> 25:03.267
her name is Clary
and I highly suggest
you keep your voice down.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.869
Why?

25:04.871 --> 25:06.537
What, are you afraid
I'm gonna upset her?

25:07.273 --> 25:09.473
We have risked our
lives again and again

25:09.475 --> 25:11.642
for this girl,
and where has it gotten us?

25:11.644 --> 25:14.645
All right? Nowhere.
We're no closer to
getting the Mortal Cup.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.113
And we've lost
the Institute's necklace.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.515
[Clary] Hey, I am right here.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.384
I don't care about
your damn jewelry.

25:21.521 --> 25:25.322
I'm sorry you're gonna
look bad in front of
your bosses, okay?

25:25.324 --> 25:28.492
But my mother is still
missing and my last
chance at finding her

25:28.494 --> 25:29.793
just disappeared
into thin air.

25:29.795 --> 25:30.961
Clary, it's gonna be fine.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.129
No, it's not!

25:33.533 --> 25:36.300
People are dying
because of me.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.635
And Magnus?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.303
Magnus will never
come out of hiding again

25:39.305 --> 25:40.971
while Valentine
is still after him.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.473
[laughs] We're
never gonna find him.

25:42.475 --> 25:45.042
And I will...
I will never get
my memories back.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.545
You give up way too easy.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.852
What is he doing?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.353
He's tracking Magnus.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.355
Be quiet and keep
your distance.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.357
The button belonged
to Magnus.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.760
Jace can pinpoint
the location using that.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.668
No.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.203
The signal's
not strong enough.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.773
Magnus must be
blocking the track.
Let's do this, Alec.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.008
Do what?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.243
<i> Parabatai  </i> tracking.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.479
Of course they are.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.817
When  <i> parabatais  </i> track,
their power grows stronger.

26:27.553 --> 26:30.454
Jace and Alec are gonna
track Magnus together.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.194
Yeah, this whole
<i>parabatai  </i> thing

26:37.196 --> 26:38.929
seems oddly intimate,
if you ask me.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.098
[sighs] You don't
know the half of it.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.941
Got him.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.558
Magnus' lair is
right behind that fence.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.059
Magnus lives
in a warehouse?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.294
Not exactly.

27:11.263 --> 27:12.663
Warlock glamour.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.900
Something's wrong.
It's far too easy
to get this close.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.902
His protective
wards must be down.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.137
[Alec] You...

27:20.906 --> 27:22.373
Don't get in the way.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.142
[man grunting]

27:25.144 --> 27:26.410
[sword slicing]
[man groaning]

27:26.412 --> 27:28.212
Oh, God!
Valentine found Magnus!

27:33.419 --> 27:34.885
Daddy!

27:36.155 --> 27:37.921
Daddy?

27:37.923 --> 27:39.089
Daddy, get up, please!

27:44.430 --> 27:46.330
Watch out!
[dull booming]

27:48.100 --> 27:49.533
Clary Fairchild.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.837
Valentine will be
so pleased to meet you.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.710
[groans]

28:00.780 --> 28:02.713
[exhales] Thanks for that.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.748
Any time.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.285
Stick close.
It's safest if
we stay together.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.653
It's okay.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.522
I won't leave you
alone, I promise.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.798
Your magic's
strong, warlock.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.400
Much stronger than
that horned weakling
I killed this morning.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.202
Elias?
[whooshing]

28:26.305 --> 28:27.404
That was his name.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.640
Well, lucky for us,
he sold you out

28:29.642 --> 28:31.642
before I took
his warlock mark.

28:31.644 --> 28:33.210
[whooshing]
[grunts]

28:35.214 --> 28:37.881
Cat's eyes.
Be a nice addition
to my collection.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.283
[arrow thudding]
[groans]

28:40.720 --> 28:42.119
[grunts]

28:43.055 --> 28:44.588
Well done.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.091
More like medium-rare.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.994
I'm Magnus.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.963
I don't think we've been
formally introduced.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.998
Alec.

28:55.901 --> 29:00.204
[stammering] Oh, uh...
We should really...
You know, probably get...

29:00.206 --> 29:02.406
Right, we should
join the party.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.507
Right.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.080
This fight's far from over.

29:19.692 --> 29:20.758
Magnus.

29:26.732 --> 29:30.768
Go join the others,
my dear. This is no place
for a little girl. Go.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.373
[sighs]

29:36.375 --> 29:37.674
I heard what
you did for Zoe.

29:37.676 --> 29:42.146
You risked your life
without hesitation to save
a young warlock child.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.716
She was just a girl
and she was in trouble.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.217
I had no choice.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.719
You always have a choice.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.556
You're not like the others,
Clary Fairchild.

29:52.558 --> 29:55.259
Most Shadowhunters
protect Downworlders
out of sense of duty,

29:55.261 --> 29:58.495
but you saved young Zoe
because of what was
inside your heart.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.932
You're more like your mother
than you will ever know.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.667
Magnus, please...

30:04.570 --> 30:06.003
you can't hide
from this battle.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.939
Look, Valentine,
he found you once,
he will find you again.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.240
We need to work together.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.708
Help me.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.512
I can summon the demon,
but you must make the demand.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.082
Now, I warn you...

30:19.084 --> 30:21.585
retrieving your memories
will not be easy.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.254
I will do what
I have to do.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.422
All right.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.425
But we're not safe here.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.527
The lair's location
has been compromised.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.697
Hold tight, everyone,
we're about to move.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.607
[energy pulsating]

30:45.144 --> 30:46.243
[gasps]

30:48.647 --> 30:49.713
[phone dialing]

30:50.649 --> 30:52.249
[line ringing]

30:55.020 --> 30:58.288
[Clary on voicemail]
<i> Hey, it's Clary.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

30:58.290 --> 30:59.590
Hey, it's me.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.825
I just...

31:03.128 --> 31:04.928
I want to flat-out
say I'm sorry.

31:06.031 --> 31:10.567
I feel like crap
for leaving you with
Jace and those guys.

31:12.571 --> 31:13.670
I don't know.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.305
Ever since we
ditched those vampires,

31:15.307 --> 31:16.874
I've been feeling
like crap a lot lately.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.842
It's... these waves...

31:18.844 --> 31:22.079
[stammering] they hit me
and I can't think straight.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.649
[sighs] I don't know,
it's probably just the flu.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.318
Anyway...

31:29.221 --> 31:30.320
Clary, you...

31:31.490 --> 31:34.124
You're the last person
I'd ever want to
leave in this world.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.627
I'm so, so sorry.

31:39.164 --> 31:42.099
Call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.434
Bye.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.638
[sighs deeply] Ah,
much better.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.707
Ugh, it's inevitable.

31:50.709 --> 31:54.411
After each move,
I get the itch
to redecorate.

31:54.413 --> 31:58.815
Normally, I love a dirty lair,
but this is one
is just sloppy.

32:06.692 --> 32:09.693
I believe in payment
for services rendered.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.262
Thank you for
defending the warlocks.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.599
[Isabelle] I couldn't.
Oh, but you could.

32:16.735 --> 32:17.935
And you should.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.771
The Lightwoods have been
wearing this for years.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.910
Besides, this would look
silly on your brother.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.633
[chuckles]

32:32.634 --> 32:34.718
About Alec,
is he more of a flower
or cologne man?

32:34.720 --> 32:35.786
[chuckles]

32:35.788 --> 32:38.288
Okay, so how do we summon
the memory demon?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.191
Are you certain?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.461
Summoning such
a powerful demon
could be lethal.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.264
I'll do anything
to save my mother.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.498
Where is the demon?

32:49.935 --> 32:53.236
Okay. Pretty boy,
get your team ready.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.472
[Jace] You know
what to do.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.275
I'm not talking to you.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.910
I'm talking to...

32:59.912 --> 33:01.178
you.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.416
Come with me.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.989
Everyone wants
the Mortal Cup.

33:11.991 --> 33:15.392
Don't trust anyone,
especially not the Clave.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.028
Then why should I trust you?

33:18.030 --> 33:19.863
You shouldn't.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.431
Only trust yourself.

33:29.141 --> 33:32.542
These chalks are beautiful.
What are they for?

33:32.544 --> 33:34.344
If a person wants
their memories returned,

33:34.346 --> 33:36.713
they must draw the pentagram
to summon the demon.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.851
I can walk you
through it, if you like.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.086
I got this.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.724
Shadowhunter...

33:49.395 --> 33:51.595
prepare Clary
as best you can.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.300
The memory demon
is a Greater Demon.

33:58.303 --> 33:59.803
The rune will be
far more powerful

33:59.805 --> 34:01.304
than anything
you've faced so far.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.075
Do it.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.647
This might sting.

34:12.751 --> 34:13.884
[flesh searing]

34:13.886 --> 34:16.053
[screaming]

34:24.930 --> 34:29.366
[Magnus] Jocelyn was right,
your artistry is
beyond compare.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.068
I don't know
about that.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.003
Oh, the only other
person I've known

34:33.005 --> 34:34.871
who could draw as well
was Michelangelo,

34:34.873 --> 34:36.740
who was excellent
in bed, I might add.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.175
[Isabelle laughs]

34:43.882 --> 34:45.115
[Magnus] Okay.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.883
We're ready.

34:46.885 --> 34:49.352
Everyone take
your rightful place
on the pentagram.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.189
Um...
Here.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.025
Thanks.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.129
We must initiate a bond.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.430
Once this bond
is sealed,

35:00.432 --> 35:02.899
it cannot be broken
until the demon retreats.

35:02.901 --> 35:08.271
No matter what happens,
we must not let go
of each other's hands.

35:20.052 --> 35:22.152
[low booming]

35:23.088 --> 35:25.555
[hazy voice whispering]

35:28.293 --> 35:29.659
[booming]

35:36.635 --> 35:38.702
[booming]
[gasps]

35:43.442 --> 35:44.774
[scoffs]

35:44.776 --> 35:46.676
You people are pathetic.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.550
[booming]
[whispering continues]

35:54.453 --> 35:56.920
[booming]

35:56.922 --> 36:02.592
I will lead the ceremony,
and you all must
do exactly as I say.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.028
The demon's name is Valak.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.429
And at some point,

36:06.431 --> 36:09.599
he will ask for
payment in exchange
for Clary's memories.

36:09.601 --> 36:10.967
What do you mean?
What kind of payment?

36:10.969 --> 36:12.369
We will see.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.771
Let us begin.

36:18.010 --> 36:22.779
[speaking Chthonian]

36:32.658 --> 36:35.725
The necklace. It's pulsing.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.699
[wind rushing]

36:45.237 --> 36:46.403
[creature growls]

36:46.405 --> 36:49.639
Valak is among us.
Do not break the bond.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.374
Hold on!
I'm trying.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.211
It is time,
the demon demands payment.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.597
What does it want?

36:56.598 --> 36:58.982
We must each relinquish
a beloved memory of
the one we love the most.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.422
[yelps]

37:09.328 --> 37:10.393
[Alec grunts]

37:18.604 --> 37:22.539
No, it's not true!
The demon deceived me!

37:22.541 --> 37:23.940
Do not break the bond!

37:23.942 --> 37:25.175
Alec, it's okay!

37:25.177 --> 37:26.776
No!
Alec!

37:26.778 --> 37:27.911
No!

37:38.557 --> 37:41.258
[straining] I cannot contain
the demon much longer!

37:44.863 --> 37:46.196
No! [grunts]

37:46.198 --> 37:48.131
[groaning]
[yelps]

37:48.133 --> 37:50.100
[creature roaring]

37:52.738 --> 37:53.803
Jace!

37:56.575 --> 37:57.874
Grab him!

37:57.876 --> 37:59.943
Grab him!
[Alec] Hold on!

38:01.913 --> 38:04.147
The demon is
growing stronger!

38:04.149 --> 38:05.615
[Alec] He's slipping!

38:05.617 --> 38:07.717
Clary! Help us!

38:09.988 --> 38:14.691
Clary, if you kill the demon,
your memories
will be lost forever!

38:16.395 --> 38:17.560
Help us!

38:22.634 --> 38:24.367
[creature screeching]

38:30.075 --> 38:31.441
[Clary] Jace...

38:31.443 --> 38:32.809
Oh, my God, Jace.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.144
Jace, get up.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.446
Is he gonna
be all right?

38:36.448 --> 38:37.747
[Magnus] I don't know.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.984
Does he normally
just lay like that
without moving?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.691
Get up. Jace.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.825
Jace.

38:49.594 --> 38:52.862
[gasping and coughing]

38:52.864 --> 38:54.197
[gasps]

38:54.199 --> 38:56.833
[breathing heavily]

38:56.835 --> 39:00.003
[weakly]
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.504
I'm all right.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.006
I'm just getting
my second wind.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.311
There's nothing to
be ashamed of, Alec.

39:08.313 --> 39:11.114
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.248
You will.

39:15.287 --> 39:18.788
Thank God, you're okay.
For a second there,
I thought we lost you.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.691
[chuckles]
Remind me again,
what's the, uh...

39:21.693 --> 39:24.027
What's the count
on how many times
I saved your life?

39:24.463 --> 39:26.396
I... I think we're even.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.964
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.132
[coughs]

39:38.643 --> 39:40.176
[knocks]

39:40.178 --> 39:41.478
Hey.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.645
Hey.

39:43.348 --> 39:44.647
How you doin'?

39:44.649 --> 39:45.849
I'm fine.

39:45.851 --> 39:46.983
Can I come in?

39:47.919 --> 39:48.985
Yeah.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.489
You know,
that move you did...

39:52.491 --> 39:55.125
launching into the tornado,
that was pretty impressive.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.094
You must have one
hell of an instructor.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.130
I didn't even know
what I was doing.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.066
I just acted.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.734
Clary...

40:06.438 --> 40:08.738
you killed one of
the Greater Demons.

40:09.674 --> 40:12.509
There's not a lot
of Shadowhunters
who can make that claim.

40:12.511 --> 40:16.846
Yeah, but in
killing that demon,
I lost my memories forever.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.682
Yeah.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.517
I can't believe that...
I'm never gonna
find my mother, am I?

40:20.519 --> 40:21.584
Hey!

40:22.521 --> 40:24.087
We will find her.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.589
I promise.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.125
Get some sleep, okay?

40:36.268 --> 40:37.700
[sighs]

40:37.702 --> 40:39.436
[phone beeps]
[line ringing]

40:40.372 --> 40:42.038
[sighs heavily]

40:42.040 --> 40:43.440
Come on, Simon.

40:44.376 --> 40:45.942
Pick up!

40:46.812 --> 40:48.211
[phone ringing]

40:51.316 --> 40:52.782
[phone clicks]

41:08.300 --> 41:09.732
[sighs]

41:09.734 --> 41:11.034
[rings clattering]

41:29.254 --> 41:30.520
Nice to see you, Clary.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.921
[gasps]

41:35.494 --> 41:37.093
You want your mother?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.430
Give me the Cup!

41:40.432 --> 41:42.265
[gasping]

41:44.603 --> 41:46.169
[breathing heavily]

41:49.274 --> 41:51.040
Mom.
