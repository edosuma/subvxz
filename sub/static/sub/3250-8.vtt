15:01.640 --> 15:03.799
Putting Hitler in the cupboard.
Cupboard.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.759
Hitler, Hitler, cupboard. Come on.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.599
-But I am the Führer!
-Right, in you go.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.559
Who are you?

15:15.360 --> 15:16.879
DOCTOR: Are you okay?

15:16.960 --> 15:17.959
WOMAN: Sir, what do we do now?

15:18.040 --> 15:19.879
Suggestion.
We should go into surveillance mode.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.799
Agreed. Let's faint.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.359
Oh! I...

15:27.880 --> 15:31.039
-I think he just fainted.
-Yes, that was a faint.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.159
Perfect faint.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.079
Mels?

15:36.800 --> 15:37.879
MELS: Hitler...

15:37.960 --> 15:39.079
What about him?

15:39.160 --> 15:40.519
Lousy shot.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.639
Mels! Mels?

15:42.720 --> 15:44.239
-Rory!
-No, no, no, no!

15:45.160 --> 15:46.519
Right, we've got to stop the bleeding.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.599
Sir, that blue box...

15:50.480 --> 15:51.559
We've got a match.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.239
We're trying to bag war criminals,

15:53.320 --> 15:56.039
we've got the biggest one ever
right under our noses.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.559
Forget Hitler.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.639
We take this one down,

15:59.720 --> 16:02.559
the Justice Department
will give us the rest of the year off.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.919
-Are you sure?
-There's no question.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.759
It's her.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.239
How bad is it, Rory? What can we do?

16:10.320 --> 16:13.159
Just keep her conscious.
Stay with us, Mels!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.879
Hey, look at me. Just hold on.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.839
I used to

16:18.920 --> 16:22.039
dream about you.
All those stories Amy used to tell me.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.199
What stories? Tell me what stories?
Vampires in Venice?

16:25.480 --> 16:27.999
When I was little,

16:28.800 --> 16:29.799
I was going to marry you.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.759
Good idea, let's get married.
You stay alive and I'll marry you. Deal?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.239
Shouldn't you ask
my parents' permission?

16:36.320 --> 16:38.479
As soon as you're well,
I'll get them on the phone.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.519
Might as well do it now.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.359
Since they're both right here.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.559
Penny in the air.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.119
Penny drops.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.679
What the hell is going on?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.679
Back, back, back. Get back!

17:07.000 --> 17:09.159
Last time I did this, I...

17:09.240 --> 17:11.239
I ended up a toddler.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.439
In the middle of New York.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.639
Okay, Doctor,
explain what is happening, please.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.159
Mels, short for...

17:18.360 --> 17:19.479
Melody.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.559
Yeah, I named my daughter after her.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.239
You named your daughter

17:24.200 --> 17:26.439
after your daughter.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.519
It took me years to find you two.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.799
I'm so glad I did.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.959
And you see?
It all worked out in the end, didn't it?

17:36.240 --> 17:38.159
You got to raise me after all.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.679
You're Melody?

17:39.880 --> 17:42.959
-But, if she's Melody, that means...
-Shut up, Dad.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.919
I'm focusing on a dress size.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.359

18:08.080 --> 18:10.759
Right. Let's see, then.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.799
Ooh, it's all going on down there,
isn't it?

18:15.920 --> 18:16.919
The hair!

18:17.000 --> 18:18.839
(GASPING) The hair!

18:18.920 --> 18:21.079
It just doesn't stop, does it?

18:21.160 --> 18:22.599
Look at that.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.039
Everything changes.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.159
Oh, but I love it. I love it!

18:28.440 --> 18:31.639
I'm all sort of...mature.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.399
Hello, Benjamin.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.079
(WHISPERS) Who's Benjamin?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.599
The teeth.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.479
(GASPING) The teeth.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.399
The teeth. Oh, look at them!

18:45.280 --> 18:47.559
Watch out, that bowtie.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.399
Excuse me, you lot.
I need to weigh myself.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.719
That's Melody.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.079
It's River Song.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.839
Who's River Song?

19:08.400 --> 19:09.399
Spoilers.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.959
Spoilers? What spoilers?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.999
Hang on, just something I have to check.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.279
Does anybody else find this day
just a bit difficult?

19:21.480 --> 19:23.039
I'm getting this sort of banging
in my head.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.839
Yeah, I think that's Hitler
in the cupboard.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.319
That's not helping.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.439
This isn't the River Song we know yet.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.759
This is her right at the start.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.159
Doesn't even know her name.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.799
RIVER: Oh! That's magnificent!

19:39.080 --> 19:41.199
I'm going to wear lots of jodhpurs.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.279
Well, that's her, all right.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.279
Melody Pond.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.439
The woman who kills the Doctor.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.159
Well, now, enough of all that.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.279
-Down to business.
-Oh! Hello.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.759
I thought we were getting married?

19:57.960 --> 20:00.719
I told you. I'm not a wedding person.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.799
Doctor, what's she doing?

20:01.880 --> 20:03.759
-What she's programmed to.
-And where'd she get the gun?

20:03.840 --> 20:07.719

As soon as I knew you were coming,
I tidied up a bit.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.719
I know you did.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.159
Watch out, that bowtie.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.079
I know you know.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.159
Goodness, is killing you
going to take all day?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.719
Why? You busy?

20:43.800 --> 20:45.999
Oh, I'm not complaining.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.999
If you were in a hurry, you could have
killed me in the cornfield.

We'd only just met.

Why would she be a psychopath?

21:06.840 --> 21:09.439
Oh, Mummy, Mummy, pay attention.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.999
I was trained and conditioned
for one purpose.

-And who's River Song?
-An old friend of mine.

Stupid name.

about to tear itself apart.

Now, that's my kind of town.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.439
Mum, Dad, don't follow me.
And yes, that is a warning.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.359
No warning for me, then?

No need, my love.

What have you done?

21:59.520 --> 22:00.519
River!

Oh, River, River, River.
More than a friend, I think.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.839
What have you done?

This time can't.

I can be brave for you.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.239

the woman who kills the Doctor.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.519
We don't kill them. We extract them

near the end of their
established time lines.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.759
Then what?

33:56.560 --> 33:57.839
Give them hell.

34:02.880 --> 34:07.399
I'd ask you who you think you are, but
I think the answer is pretty obvious.

What is the Silence?
Why is it called that? What...

35:08.120 --> 35:09.279
What does it mean?

35:09.360 --> 35:11.359
The Silence is not a species.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.599
It is a religious order or movement.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.919
Their core belief is that silence
will fall when the question is asked.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.199
What question?

35:18.280 --> 35:21.799
The first question.

Doctor?

40:01.680 --> 40:02.799
Doctor, you did it!

40:02.880 --> 40:05.239
(BOTH LAUGHING) You did it!

40:05.320 --> 40:06.479
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

40:12.640 --> 40:14.479
I seem to be able to fly her.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.359
She showed me how.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.039
She taught me.

40:22.440 --> 40:25.919
The Doctor says I am the child
of the Tardis.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.439
What does he mean?

40:30.760 --> 40:32.159
Where is he?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.399
You can't die now.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.839
I know you don't die now.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.399
Oh, Pond!

40:43.880 --> 40:45.559
You've got a schedule for everything.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.279
It doesn't... It doesn't make any sense.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.919
Doctor, what do we do? Come on!

40:52.880 --> 40:54.399
How do we help you?

40:55.040 --> 40:56.599
Sorry, Rory, you can't.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.039
Nobody can.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.439
Ponds, listen to me.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.399
I need to talk to your daughter.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.079
Find her.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.439
Find River Song.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.599
And tell her something from me.

41:33.880 --> 41:35.319
Tell her what?

41:39.120 --> 41:40.879
(WHISPERING)

41:43.120 --> 41:45.799
(GASPING) Well, I'm sure she knows.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.159
Who's River Song?

42:24.720 --> 42:28.039
Are you still working?
Because I'm still a relative.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.959
Access files on River Song.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.239
Records available.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.719
Show me her.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.039
Show me River Song.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.119
Melody...

43:07.120 --> 43:08.719
What did he say?

43:08.920 --> 43:11.879
The Doctor gave you
a message for River Song.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.639
What was it?

43:19.880 --> 43:21.519
What's happening?

43:21.920 --> 43:23.959
River, what are you doing?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.519
Just tell me.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.839
The Doctor...

43:31.640 --> 43:33.119
Is he worth it?

43:34.160 --> 43:37.319
Yes! Yes, mmm-hmm, he is.

43:51.440 --> 43:52.799
(GASPING)

43:54.080 --> 43:55.279
River?

43:56.200 --> 43:58.799
No... What are you doing?

44:00.040 --> 44:01.919
Hello, sweetie.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.079
Hey.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.159
-Where am I?
-You're safe now.

44:42.080 --> 44:46.039
Apparently, you used all your remaining
regenerations in one go.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.079
You shouldn't have done that.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.399
Mother,

44:50.920 --> 44:52.399
I had to try.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.399
I know.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.239
He said no one could save him.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.479
But he must have known I could.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.479
Rule one,

45:04.920 --> 45:06.519
the Doctor lies.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.079
She just needs to rest.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.039
She'll be absolutely fine.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.239
No...

45:15.920 --> 45:17.039
she won't.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.639
She will be...

45:21.840 --> 45:23.119
amazing!

45:36.560 --> 45:38.479
So that's it? We just leave her there?

45:38.560 --> 45:40.639
Sisters of the Infinite Schism,

45:40.720 --> 45:42.279
greatest hospital in the universe.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.679
Yeah, but she's our daughter.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.519
Doctor, she's River,

45:45.640 --> 45:47.039
and she's our daughter.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.599
Amy, I know.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.759
But we have to let her
make her own way now.

45:51.840 --> 45:54.079
We have too much foreknowledge,
it's a...

45:56.400 --> 45:58.519
dangerous thing, foreknowledge.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.879
-What's that?
-Nothing!

46:00.960 --> 46:04.319
Just some data I downloaded from
the Tesselecta, very boring.

46:04.680 --> 46:06.439
Doctor, River was brainwashed
to kill you, right?

46:06.520 --> 46:09.959
Well, she did kill me and then she used
her remaining lives to bring me back.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.839
As firsts dates go,

46:11.920 --> 46:14.199
I'd say that was mixed signals.

46:14.280 --> 46:16.639
But that stuff
that they put in her head.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.999
Is that gone now?

46:19.280 --> 46:21.519
The River that we know in the future,

46:21.680 --> 46:24.399
she is in prison, for murder.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.039
Whose murder?

46:36.760 --> 46:37.999
Will we see her again?

46:38.080 --> 46:39.599
Oh, she'll come looking for us.

46:39.680 --> 46:42.679
Yeah, but how? How do people
even look for you?

46:43.040 --> 46:44.359
Oh, Pond!

46:45.320 --> 46:47.959
Haven't you figured that one out yet?

46:54.160 --> 46:55.919
So then, tell me,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.599
why do you want to study archaeology?

47:02.200 --> 47:04.879
Well, to be perfectly honest, Professor,

47:05.480 --> 47:07.559
I'm looking for a good man.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.559
(WHISPERING) Please save me
from the monsters.

47:15.640 --> 47:16.959
DOCTOR: Tell me about George.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.479
Well, he's scared to death
of everything.

47:18.560 --> 47:21.479
George, you have to face your fears.
You have to face them now!

47:21.560 --> 47:23.279
(SCREAMING)

47:24.520 --> 47:25.919
We're dead, again.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.719
You see these eyes? They're old eyes.

47:28.840 --> 47:29.959
(SCREAMING)

47:30.040 --> 47:32.319
The only thing I can tell you...

47:32.720 --> 47:33.999
monsters are real.

47:34.080 --> 47:35.119
(LAUGHING)
