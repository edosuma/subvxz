00:05.760 --> 00:07.560
This is car 53, accident center.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.000
We're at the scene of the accident.
Bus with truck,

00:10.240 --> 00:12.800
one mile north of 1-10
about 15 seriously injured.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.720
Age 15 to 18.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.680
Car 210 at Angel's headquarters.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.960
Car 210 at Angel's headquarters.
Angels, please come.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.280
Reply.
You are the Angels headquarters.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.600
Angel's headquarters here.
Do you speak.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.240
Angels, we're in a
bus and truck accident.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.760
A high school soccer team.
Patient report is coming soon.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.520
Did you say a school bus?

00:33.920 --> 00:35.720
Correctly.
A school bus-truck collision.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.760
I already have two dead.
No, three.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.360
Three dead.  15 seriously injured.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.400
-Lots of kids.
-Angels, I have 12 cars.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.920
-12 cars are going...
-Getting started soon.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.880
... clear for transport.  The
first wave will come in 5 minutes.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.960
I repeat, five minutes.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.840
You have to wake up, Mike.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.120
OK?

01:02.960 --> 01:06.840
You have to...
you have to open your eyes.

01:08.840 --> 01:09.920
Now.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.480
Please wake up

01:15.320 --> 01:17.840
Yes exactly.  Once again!
Move your hand again!

01:19.280 --> 01:21.040
-What's happening?
-He moves.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.720
His hand moved.
Just a little, but still.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.080
That's great...

01:26.200 --> 01:27.640
It could be... great.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.880
-Could?
-Yes.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.600
-These are just involuntary...
-Mario...

01:32.720 --> 01:34.440
Involuntary movements
and twitching are normal.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.640
He responded to me

01:36.120 --> 01:38.160
I asked him to wake up and
he moved his hand.  I know it.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.240
Then that's a good sign.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.000
Right?

01:41.680 --> 01:42.640
Right.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.600
Are you ready?

01:48.680 --> 01:49.640
Yes.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.640
All hands to the Center Stage.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.760
All hands to the Center Stage.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.920
Seventeen year old with blunt
chest and stomach injuries.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.760
Pulseless at the scene of the accident.
The pulse came back on the way.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.560
-Now he's gone again.
- Forty-two year old

02:07.680 --> 02:10.120
Belted driver, grazes and
bruises, half unconscious.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.120
We need a head scan
as soon as we arrive, go!

02:12.240 --> 02:13.480
He is passed out,
the pulse is weak.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.080
Positive PSI, facial
trauma, no more signs of life.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.360
He's been lifeless for 20 minutes.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.440
Well, let's get him in.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.520
What's your name?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
Holden.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.320
Look at me!  Can you hear me?

02:22.840 --> 02:25.080
We're at the Angels
Memorial, we'll take care of you.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.880
-I'm fine!
-Strong boy!

02:27.760 --> 02:28.720
Is that the bus driver?

02:28.840 --> 02:31.040
No, he died on the spot.
This is the truck driver.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.720
He was heading straight into her lane.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.280
-Saturation is down to 80%.
-Is there a problem, Dr.  Pineda?

02:35.400 --> 02:37.040
No.  But we should
do a tox screen.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.240
How he came from is not
our problem at the moment.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.880
Concentration.
You're not there yet.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.040
Go away.  We have to go through.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.320
James hold on man!

02:47.440 --> 02:48.640
Focus on me.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.080
-OK?
-Will he die?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.000
He has to get on the couch.
He's having a heart attack!

02:52.400 --> 02:53.440
Moment!

02:53.560 --> 02:55.520
The board is stuck on the belt.
Get some scissors!

02:55.640 --> 02:56.640
Don't stop the heart massage!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.000
-Jesse, we need help here.
-James?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.920
James, what are they doing to him?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.960
-Thank you.
-Good.  Two three...

03:04.000 --> 03:05.720
I straighten my leg again.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.880
Dr.  Piel, 10 mg of morphine.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.120
It has been dislocated
before, do it without anesthesia.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.200
Fine

03:11.320 --> 03:12.720
We're at 64%.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.080
It will collapse if it
drops any further.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.520
Sixty-four percent!  What?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.760
So fast  I can't
get the tube in.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.840
Well, away there, away there.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.320
Intubate him, I'll
leave that to you.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.480
Elliot, do the chest
compressions.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.760
What are you doing?
Why are you stopping

03:32.440 --> 03:35.320
There is brain matter
coming out of his ear.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.560
What?  Damn it.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.680
I declare him dead.
Are there any objections?

03:41.920 --> 03:43.960
Time of death is 5:07 pm.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.480
You got six seconds to process

03:47.280 --> 03:48.480
then you come out
of there with me.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.640
James hold on man!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.080
Your coach, I need a room!

03:54.200 --> 03:55.760
Put it here.  This is your room.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.440
Somebody has to
help me find my son!

03:57.560 --> 03:59.480
Sir, you have to stay here.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.720
He is the team captain.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.360
Ready?  Wait a minute.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.320
And one, two...

04:07.400 --> 04:09.080
Sure you don't want
anything that relaxes you?

04:09.480 --> 04:10.440
No.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.440
Give him half the dose.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.840
You put it away well.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.480
Deep breaths.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.560
Come on.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.760
OK.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.680
-Where is the saturation?
-At 50%.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.440
Dr.  Pineda, do the
puncture, please.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.280
Pierce the windpipe.  I agree.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.160
I have it.  I am in.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.400
Don't stop the massage,
not even for a second.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.440
You have to help her!
James hold on man!

04:36.560 --> 04:38.360
Will he get well again?  James!

04:44.720 --> 04:46.040
Dr.  Piel, push him out.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.080
Check the blood
supply to the leg.  Is the?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.160
Count me in!

04:52.040 --> 04:54.040
-How many units are there?
-Four.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.160
Is he alright?

04:58.240 --> 04:59.760
You transfuse the bed, not him.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.160
There are dozens more
kids, declare him dead.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.920
This is not your
patient, doctor.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.920
Tell me what's up

05:14.680 --> 05:16.360
James!  What is happening to him?

05:16.720 --> 05:17.720
Get him out.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.960
James!  What is happening to him?
Is he dead?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.920
James!

05:25.760 --> 05:28.600
Pause chest compressions.
Check the pulse.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.960
Still no pulse.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.720
-Since when has the heart stood still?
-30 minutes.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.600
Someone else is coming!

05:37.240 --> 05:38.200
Put it down somewhere.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.000
Are there any objections?

05:40.680 --> 05:41.640
No.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.160
Four cars are on the way.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.520
I'm sorry kid

05:55.960 --> 05:57.600
I wanted to help him.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.680
I used my jacket as
a pressure bandage.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.960
He's in cardiac arrest.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.480
I wanted to help him.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.320
I am the team captain.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.600
I'm sorry kid

06:09.720 --> 06:10.680
We can't identify any.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.760
Everyone is wearing
their jerseys and their

06:11.880 --> 06:13.640
IDs are in their sports
bags under the bus.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.680
Do you know where my dad is?

06:28.840 --> 06:30.400
Nobody knows where he is.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.760
I think he's fine.
I saw him go away.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.520
It's you, Jessamine, isn't it?

06:39.120 --> 06:41.520
I mean, Charlotte Piel.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.360
I read that you became a doctor.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.720
It still hurts.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.560
Mom right?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.880
-That works too.
-Could you help me out here?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.480
That's what I'm here for.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.800
OK.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.160
He says he's in great pain.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.040
You put your knee
back into place, right?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.400
What?  What's happening?

07:04.040 --> 07:05.160
Dr.  Willis...

07:05.600 --> 07:07.160
Do you have to consult him?

07:07.440 --> 07:08.640
What's happening?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.040
His pulse values
​​were normal earlier.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.360
-It's like it's on fire.
-No pulse.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.240
I give him five
units of morphine.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.440
I do not get it.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.480
-You should check your pulse.
-I have.  Twice.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.960
The capillary fill time was short.
His pulse was strong.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.040
Not any longer longer.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.920
Does someone want to
tell me what's going on?

07:26.040 --> 07:28.000
-He needs an operation.
-Operated?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.320
How so?

07:29.440 --> 07:31.560
The artery in the back knee
was injured during straightening.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.240
We'll take you to the
operating room to fix that.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.320
OK.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.560
-I'll let the operating room know.
-Good thank you.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.520
Sister, prepare him for
the relocation.  Come.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.160
-Will he lose his leg?
-Why are you here?

07:44.600 --> 07:45.440
Excuse me?

07:45.640 --> 07:47.760
If that's just a stopover
until the next film...

07:47.880 --> 07:49.880
No, I am here to treat patients.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.840
Answer me my question,
is the boy losing his leg?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.560
-Dr.  Willis, is there a problem?
-I'm okay.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.680
I was supposed to be checking
a patient's blood flow, I did.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.920
How exactly?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.240
I checked his pulse.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.800
Dorsalis pedis and tibialis
posterior.  Like in a textbook.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.040
-What textbook is that?
-Elford and Patreedus.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.120
Sorry?

08:07.240 --> 08:08.600
Emergency procedures,
Elford and Patreedus.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.200
I know the book, where
does it say that an artery

08:11.320 --> 08:12.520
injury can only be checked
by measuring your pulse?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.040
Chapter 26, second paragraph.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.640
Ninety percent of all
patients with arterial

08:17.760 --> 08:18.920
injuries show up
on the pulse check.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.040
-Do you remember that?
-But it's not a textbook.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.240
This is a real hospital, 10%
missing, that's too much.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.440
You should have ordered a
Doppler or ankle-arm index.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.240
What is the prognosis
for this patient?

08:29.520 --> 08:30.720
Maybe we were quick enough.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.159
It was my fault, wasn't it?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.200
This boy is losing
his leg because of me.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.280
No, it's not your fault.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.000
Doctor, go to the
patient and write the file.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.440
I want to tell you
something about this girl.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.240
She is the best
of her senior year.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.000
It wasn't her film
career, it was herself.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.600
She is brilliant and
has a good heart.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.120
Maybe I'm used to
military regulations.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.360
She's not in the military.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.520
She is a junior doctor
in her first year, she is

08:53.640 --> 08:57.400
not yet ready for the
consequences of this mistake.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.440
This is none of us.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.600
The police have to go.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.680
-Mrs.  Williams, according to the rules...
-He's passed out!

09:13.800 --> 09:16.000
Why can't you leave him alone?

09:16.400 --> 09:18.080
Officer, please
give us a moment.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.960
You blame him.
You don't know what happened.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.400
They want to find out.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.840
How do they know that the
bus driver is not to blame?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.760
Because the bus
was still in its lane.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.960
Dr.  Pineda, see if there
are beds on the ITS.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.600
He must have fallen asleep.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.480
-He comes to the ITS.
-Is that a crime?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.840
-Maybe a few weeks.
-He always stays awake.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.720
-There is no treatment.
-He rolls down the window

09:40.840 --> 09:42.800
listens to music,
he calls me at home.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.400
He'd never do drugs,
but that's what they think?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.320
The toxicological investigation
will show all of that.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.720
-I'm telling you...
-He'll need you.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.560
My husband is not a criminal.
He follows the rules.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.680
He works so hard.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.720
He couldn't stand
it if he knew he

09:58.840 --> 10:00.560
was responsible for
the death of people.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.120
Because he's a good person.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.360
He is a good man.
Come on, tell him that.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.720
Tell him he's a good man.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.640
At the moment

10:11.000 --> 10:13.920
we have to hope that
the swelling will go down.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.240
What are you saying?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.520
Will he die?

10:21.640 --> 10:23.440
We'll know in a few hours.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.960
Why are we repairing the artery
with tissue from the great rose vein?

10:33.080 --> 10:34.680
You mean why are
you fixing the artery?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.480
I've been holding a
retractor for two hours.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.040
-Are you bored?
-Yes.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.640
Am i a surgeon or a nurse?
No offense.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.040
The jury is still undecided.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.280
Why don't you answer
the question?  If you can.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.760
Better long-term patency
compared to synthetic.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.280
Go on.  I am good at it.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.040
When you're good at it, seal

10:50.160 --> 10:51.400
the distal end of
the anastomosis.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.720
Count to five.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.760
Four, three, two...

10:58.680 --> 11:00.600
-Finished.
-OK.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.080
Let's see what we have here.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.360
No leak.
Distal blood flow is good.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.680
Not good enough.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.800
The tissue does not perfuse.
Damn it.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.560
-It could still...
-No, no.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.880
It's not your fault.
It was too late.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.880
The blood flows in
the foot, but it doesn't

11:20.000 --> 11:22.360
matter, the lower leg
is lost, it is not viable.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.400
We're going to
amputate below the knee.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.480
We have less than
six hours to do it.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.960
He is only 16, his father
has to consent.  Close.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.440
Is it just the lower abdomen?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.520
Yeah, like bad stomach cramps.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.000
How long have you had it?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.400
For at least a month.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.440
I am tough and have
a high pain tolerance.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.280
She is really strong.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.320
There is nothing strong
about ignoring this pain.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.840
It could be an ovarian
cyst or appendicitis.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.000
She needs a urinalysis,
SS test and gyn examination.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.640
-All right, Sugar Bear?
-Yes.  And don't call me that.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.480
We don't have a
hanger here so do this...

12:08.600 --> 12:11.040
... among your... well...

12:11.560 --> 12:12.840
... Po.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.080
-What is an SS test?
-A pregnancy test.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.360
I thought so.
I am not pregnant though.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.040
Well, put your
legs up here, okay.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.520
Dr.  Willis?
It's what I suspected right?

12:31.280 --> 12:32.760
I need to talk to the father.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.160
He should approve the second operation.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.920
-I want to come with you.
-You don't have to.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.880
I want this. I have to.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.760
Let's go.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.480
And don't get emotional.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.600
It's their right, not yours.

12:46.160 --> 12:50.280
Mr. Paxton, we know
you go through a lot

12:51.000 --> 12:52.680
but we need your approval.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.040
You want my permission
to cut off his leg?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.920
He played in the
selection as a freshman,

13:01.320 --> 13:04.320
he scored more goals than
anyone else in school history.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.000
-He can live normally.
-You don't understand.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.440
This is not a normal boy.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.840
He has strength, balance
and is incredibly agile.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.120
He wants to take part in the Olympics.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.640
Keeping the leg will
lead to a serious infection

13:15.920 --> 13:17.160
which can be life-threatening.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.840
He would rather die

13:21.960 --> 13:23.480
than to do what
you ask him to do.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.800
We don't ask him.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.840
We tell you that doing nothing
will have grave consequences.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.400
Sally, do that again.
It's time.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.680
Embouchure.  Embouchure.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.560
Sorry, I don't speak French.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.080
-Sally...
-Hold him, okay?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.800
Sally, do that again.  Sally.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.240
-Sir, what's your name?
-Surname?

13:57.360 --> 13:58.800
He doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.760
-Sally.  I agree.  Sally?
-Who is Sally?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.400
I don't know, but it would
be good if she came.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.720
Mario, can you help us?

14:03.840 --> 14:05.920
I told them that.  I met
you a long time ago, Sally.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.080
Angus, take his arm.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.360
-Noa, put it in!
-I'm trying!

14:10.480 --> 14:11.560
Mario Savetti!

14:11.680 --> 14:12.920
-Sally...
-What is it, Doc?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.040
Mario...

14:14.760 --> 14:15.800
-Sally?
- He's running away.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.880
Grab it.

14:17.000 --> 14:17.960
Hold on to him.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.760
Call the security guards.

14:21.640 --> 14:22.840
I need fixations!

14:23.680 --> 14:24.800
Noa, are you alright?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.240
Is it always like this here?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.680
What are you doing here dad?

14:37.720 --> 14:40.200
I have to staple
you, you need a CT.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.240
Then you can sober up.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.080
-How did you fall?
-I do not remember.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.240
You are amazing do you know that

14:51.640 --> 14:54.400
You come here after not
seeing you in two years.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.560
What are you doing in L.A. anyway?

14:57.240 --> 14:58.400
I had business here.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.080
Stop doing that.
I have real opportunities.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.360
I just need some
money, that's all.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.720
-So I am the business.
-No, this is real.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.320
How many times have you
asked me for money?  I tell you

15:14.680 --> 15:16.880
Whenever you come out
of nowhere and say "Hi".

15:17.400 --> 15:19.800
-I'll see you later.
-I'll pay you back.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.000
You can never repay
what you owe me.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.120
I hope there won't be a scar.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.040
Oh, that's not bad.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.960
The one on my back is big,
I got it when I kick-flipped.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.600
I skate.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.640
You're not talking
about ice skating?

15:37.840 --> 15:39.000
No.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.080
Hey, this is a ring
from Langley Academy.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.600
It's a private university in L.A.
I know a lot from there.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.600
Is there a name on it?

15:48.720 --> 15:50.640
"Goddard".
Our patient has a name.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.720
My first friend was there too.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
I once dated one
from there, actually two.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.360
-No first name abbreviations?
-No.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.520
What are you doing?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.240
I'm on the Langley
Academy graduate page.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.080
There are three...

16:01.360 --> 16:03.160
Here, Mark Goddard.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.200
Graduation class '07.
26 years old.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.840
Yearbook, jazz band,
a capella band, boring.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.680
-Is there an address?
-No, but just a moment...

16:09.800 --> 16:11.520
Here, he has a Facebook page.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.040
Damn it, it's private.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.760
But we have three
friends in common.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.160
I am writing to a mutual friend.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.240
That's a real coincidence.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.280
Is not it.
Have you ever been on Facebook?

16:19.760 --> 16:21.000
She was already
worried about him.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.240
She's on his side...
wait a minute...

16:24.080 --> 16:25.640
He hasn't posted
anything in a year.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.000
But his brother tagged him in a

16:27.120 --> 16:28.480
series of posts
that he was missing.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.880
What's his brother's name?

16:30.000 --> 16:33.600
Brian!  Brian Goddard.
He lives in L.A.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.760
Generation Y leaves the room.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.040
Sorry... Mario.  Mario.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.520
You radiate quite a panic

16:43.640 --> 16:45.760
-You should work on that.
-I know.  I'm sorry.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.880
Do not apologize.
Tell me why you are panic.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.240
-Beth's CT scans are back.
-And?

16:50.360 --> 16:52.880
Prostatitis.
She has prostatitis.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.600
What are you talking about

16:55.720 --> 16:57.280
Wake up and sniff the estrogen.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.360
Is she trans?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.760
You didn't notice when you
examined that she was a guy?

17:02.880 --> 17:05.400
But she's not a guy.
She is a woman.  Age.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
Tell him, Sugar Bear.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.280
I don't want "Sugar
Bears" to gain acceptance.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.680
Oops, too late.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.520
Come on, you two.
We'll talk to her together.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.720
-Nice to have you here.
-Thank you for finding me.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.119
How long have you seen him?

17:21.240 --> 17:22.200
Since over a year.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.280
He is schizophrenic.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.359
He stops taking the medication
and runs away.  It is terrible.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.640
We gave him antipsychotics.
But that will take time.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.400
Mark...

17:31.800 --> 17:34.040
My god you look awful.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.520
Mark, it's me Brian.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.520
We had to sedate him.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.560
It does not matter.
If he's drifted that

17:42.680 --> 17:44.440
way, he wouldn't
recognize me anyway.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.040
Like having a
brother, but not really.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
Did you find out who Sally is?

17:53.320 --> 17:55.040
There is nothing
to be found out.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.680
This is... Sally.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.240
Hey Mark.  See what i found

18:10.640 --> 18:12.640
I should have said something.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.280
But whenever I do that everyone
always wants to talk about it

18:17.120 --> 18:18.400
especially doctors.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.200
I should never be a man.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.960
I do not know more.
That's it  Basta.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.200
Unfortunately, some parts
of your body are still male.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.360
For real?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.200
Has your appendix
been removed, doc?

18:29.320 --> 18:32.320
Or do you still have the
useless evolutionary relic?

18:32.720 --> 18:34.240
Doesn't that make you a
Neanderthal man, does it?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.320
The appendix was
recently rehabilitated...

18:36.440 --> 18:39.320
-Shut up both of you.
-Thank you.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.040
Sorry, I'm just saying that...

18:42.400 --> 18:45.840
Your operation didn't remove
the prostate, it's inflamed.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.080
You will need
antibiotics intravenously.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.400
-Prostate?
-Rose.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.040
Rose, listen...

18:56.080 --> 18:58.680
I still am  I am still me.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.800
-I wanted to tell you, I...
-When?

19:01.080 --> 19:03.040
I was just waiting
for the right moment.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.200
-Could you leave us alone?
-No, it's okay.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.480
-I'm going anyway.
-Rose?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.160
What are you doing?

19:14.400 --> 19:17.360
We scan the abdomen
to rule out other injuries.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.480
When will he get his ITS bed?

19:20.600 --> 19:22.240
Maybe in a few hours.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.280
-What's happening?
-Ventricular tachycardia.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.600
We have to shock him.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.640
The pads, please.

19:33.560 --> 19:34.800
Ready.  And electricity!

19:35.120 --> 19:36.400
Power surge!

19:40.240 --> 19:41.760
Back in sinus rhythm again.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.800
-So will he be back?
-Moment.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.600
Unfortunately, its
ventricular wall hardly moves.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.360
He's in cardiogenic shock.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.840
What does that mean?

19:54.960 --> 19:57.440
The brain trauma put too
much strain on his heart.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.880
He won't make it, will he?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.800
Enter antihypotonic
drugs with a three-lumen

20:08.920 --> 20:10.280
venous catheter, and
order a formal echo.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.640
Do you want us to
call someone for you?

20:15.760 --> 20:16.720
My God...

20:28.320 --> 20:29.360
So where is he

20:30.800 --> 20:31.960
Yes, it is an emergency.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.360
-What's happening?
-He's calling other clinics.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.120
He wants a second opinion.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.840
No, don't put me in the queue.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.000
Smaller...

20:41.880 --> 20:43.520
You have to trust us.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.120
We are your second opinion.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.160
Dad, I don't want him there.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.360
Can i talk to you outside?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.360
You have to stop.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.680
It's not that easy.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.560
The leg will become infectious
and necrotic in a few hours.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.840
A few hours later it
becomes septic and he dies.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.680
Is that easy enough for you?

21:11.600 --> 21:13.160
You must be a father now.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.440
I agree.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.960
But you have to
persuade him to do it.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.680
You are the doctor.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.880
I can't do it.  I can’t.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.920
For the rest of his
life he thinks I'm the

21:29.040 --> 21:32.400
one who advised him
to have an amputation.

21:34.840 --> 21:35.960
You're welcome.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.400
Where is my dad?

21:45.960 --> 21:47.160
I have to talk to you alone.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.560
-I'm busy.
-Hang up.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.440
You don't like to give up, do you?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.120
You probably told the
boys that before every game.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.000
"We never give up."

22:04.040 --> 22:05.240
And you never lost a game.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.480
I'm sorry you lost this, Holden.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.320
It's over.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.080
It's time for a new game.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.200
This is going to be harder
than what you played.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.120
But if you work on it,
you'll get good at it too.

22:27.240 --> 22:31.280
You will still be a hero.
For your team, your father,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.600
for anyone who sees
what a man can do after

22:34.720 --> 22:36.880
the worst happens to
him but he never gives up.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.600
You are their captain.
You have to show them the way.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.920
-How do you feel?
-Oh, this is going to be great.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.800
How are you dad

23:04.640 --> 23:06.560
Get it in and prepare it.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.840
Why was there the delay
in the boy's first operation?

23:13.960 --> 23:15.800
The arterial injury did
not show up until later.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.880
How could that happen?

23:17.000 --> 23:17.960
Did the Doppler
not show anything?

23:18.080 --> 23:20.120
-I checked my pulse manually.
-What?

23:21.000 --> 23:21.960
Where did you study

23:22.080 --> 23:23.040
West Point, Harvard Med.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.680
I learned printing associations from
the Boy Scouts.  Was stupid.  Sorry

23:26.040 --> 23:27.000
You should be fired.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.320
Fortunately, I
don't work for you.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.400
No.  You should fire me.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.480
-Dr.  Piel...
-No!

23:30.680 --> 23:32.480
I am grateful for
what you want to do

23:32.760 --> 23:34.480
but I've got special
treatment all my life.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.680
I don't want this.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.640
It was my fault.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.440
I only checked
the pulse manually.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.480
You don't tell the family
about it, understand?

23:47.120 --> 23:48.960
You stay calm until I
have spoken to the council

23:49.080 --> 23:50.800
and until the pathology
examines the leg.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.120
That would be all, Dr.  Piel.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.480
She is still young.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.600
But she made a big
mistake that cost him his leg.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.280
And we come into the
crosshairs of a process.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.040
And you want to protect them.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.920
It won't help her or you.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.160
We will notify your officer.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.480
You're welcome.  Then
maybe I'll get to where I belong.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.160
Once upon a time there was a boy

24:34.720 --> 24:38.280
A strangely enchanted boy

24:40.480 --> 24:43.840
They say he wandered very far

24:45.040 --> 24:46.600
Very far

24:48.080 --> 24:51.000
Over land and sea

24:52.080 --> 24:53.720
A little bit shy

24:55.800 --> 24:57.560
With sad eyes

24:59.720 --> 25:01.560
But very wise

25:02.840 --> 25:04.680
He was

25:13.720 --> 25:15.440
Two doctors didn't notice

25:16.440 --> 25:18.320
and one of them
did a pelvic exam.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.960
-She is a beautiful woman.
-Yes.

25:24.880 --> 25:25.920
That is her.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.080
We've only been a
couple for a few months

25:30.320 --> 25:33.640
but i was so in love...

25:33.760 --> 25:36.720
Many different people come
here every day.  Hundreds.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.120
On the worst day of your life

25:39.480 --> 25:41.080
they all have one thing in common.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.880
They need someone
else to look after them.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.720
Do you know what that taught me?

25:47.600 --> 25:51.440
We are all the same.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.640
All of us.

25:57.680 --> 26:01.280
I didn't know when
to say I wasn't 38.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.640
Now would be a good time.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.720
The urinary
catheter is in place.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.280
I'm sorry if that hurt.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.240
Shouldn't the liquid
be yellow like urine?

26:21.360 --> 26:24.160
This is pus.  Oh my God.
Everything full of pus.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.720
What do you mean by pus?

26:25.840 --> 26:28.920
Infection.  An infection.
Do not worry.  I do that.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.160
-You need to calm down.
-I am.  I am totally calm.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.520
-I feel dizzy.
-Beth?

26:35.640 --> 26:38.520
Beth!  Stay awake.
It's a septic shock.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.440
You have to go to the Center Stage.
And now.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.840
Blood pressure 60 to 40.
I need help!

26:50.640 --> 26:52.240
Your CT is clean.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.520
With a couple of
brackets, can I go?

26:56.320 --> 26:58.040
I should have gone
to the office supplies.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.920
Someone has to
remove them in a week.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.960
Go to the office
store if you want.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.280
Have you thought
about what I asked you

27:04.880 --> 27:07.360
-I do not need much.
-Stop drinking.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.640
Now are you teaching me

27:09.760 --> 27:11.600
I have changed.  I grew up.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.520
You have no idea who I am

27:14.640 --> 27:16.680
Only I know, buddy.

27:20.760 --> 27:21.960
Come on, Mario.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.040
Suction!

27:26.000 --> 27:27.160
Suction!

27:29.040 --> 27:30.200
What's happening?

27:30.400 --> 27:31.360
Probably bleeding varices.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.280
He needs 0 negative
and fresh frozen plasma.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.440
The systolic blood
pressure is down to 70.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.680
He has no veins.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.440
We need access now.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.880
The blood pressure is below 56.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.200
I place an
intraosseous approach.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.680
Good.  Transfuse the
blood directly into the bone.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.720
-Good.  I am in.
-Turn the tip.

27:52.840 --> 27:53.760
OK.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.720
Good.  Give me the blood

28:01.880 --> 28:03.080
-Come on.
-The blood pressure rises.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.880
84 to 45.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.840
OK.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.400
Give proton pump inhibitors.
Says the gastro, we're coming.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.680
Varices?

28:24.560 --> 28:25.720
He has liver failure.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.760
That's what happens
when you're an alcoholic.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.400
It's collapsing folks.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.120
Get 40 ready.  It has to work!

28:35.240 --> 28:36.920
She has no veins.
As if everyone had shrunk.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.440
It's called sepsis, Dr.  Dixon.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.960
The bacteria tear billions
of holes in the vessel walls.

28:42.320 --> 28:46.760
I'm nanometers away
I can't pull this up.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.240
How long have you been here?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.120
She's already here, there
wasn't a drug for tuberculosis yet.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.480
And you were here
before the plague.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.040
Tell him about the last ice age.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.840
- Caveman.
-I meant today.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.480
This layer.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.560
Actually...

29:00.440 --> 29:02.080
It's been a couple of shifts.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.280
Every vein I get
bursts when I go in.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.600
Blood pressure is falling!
I need greater access.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.120
It looks better for you.
I want to look.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.720
I keep introducing it,
the vessel keeps moving.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.080
Here.  Give it a try.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.880
I'm trying to get in.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.400
Down a bit.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.080
They are in.
Enter vasopressors.

29:28.240 --> 29:31.000
Dr.  Dixon, a sister reportedly
hooked on norepinephrine.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.360
Thank you.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.520
Sometimes you just need
a couple of rested eyes.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.560
Okay, Jesse.  Attach the
pressure infusion bags.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.120
Understood daddy.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.480
I hope that someday they'll
put something edible in there.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.160
Where is charlotte?

29:49.280 --> 29:50.720
She has these
delicious energy bars.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.520
It's up.  She's talking to
the child who lost the leg.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.080
Are you kidding?  Damn it.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.680
-Is this a problem?
-A huge one.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.640
You may feel
phantom pain, it hurts.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.920
We can help you then.

30:06.680 --> 30:10.080
Mirror field therapy,
nerve cuff stimulation.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.880
Are you my doctor now?

30:12.040 --> 30:13.280
One of them, yes.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.960
-Listen, Holden...
-I haven't seen it yet.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.400
I am very scared of it.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.280
I don't wanna do it
in front of my dad.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.840
Would you mind...

30:29.840 --> 30:30.960
Of course not.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.040
Here.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.240
Wow!

30:56.400 --> 30:57.960
I don't want to lie, this is...

31:00.320 --> 31:01.480
That's shocking.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.360
I'm sorry for my dad.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.640
He acts so cool...

31:17.680 --> 31:19.200
But he's devastated.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.720
He had high hopes for me.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.240
-I have to tell you something.
-Charlotte!

31:27.760 --> 31:31.080
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you are needed below

31:31.720 --> 31:32.760
It is an emergency.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.440
Do you want to end your
career here and now?

31:39.920 --> 31:41.600
I won't let that happen.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.000
You said you want a girlfriend.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.920
I am speaking as
your friend right now.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.080
Is everything okay

31:52.200 --> 31:54.200
-It went fine, didn't it?
-She will be fine.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.600
She gets broad
spectrum antibiotics.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.720
I'm still virgin.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.760
-You are joking.
-We didn't want to know.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.280
Maybe that contributed
to this, I don't know.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.960
Maybe during the
pelvic exam I...

32:04.080 --> 32:06.120
No no.
You're making a fool of yourself.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.680
So. I have to see my patients.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.800
Come on, sugar
bears, let's go for a walk.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.520
Does he react to the
vasopressors, Dr.  Pineda?

32:17.840 --> 32:18.880
No.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.520
Alice asked us to
remove the breathing tube

32:22.640 --> 32:23.880
so that it would be
more comfortable for him.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.080
He said my name earlier.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.160
He keeps going unconscious.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.200
I just don't want
him to be in pain.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.160
He doesn't have that.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.320
Are the toxicological
findings there?

32:38.160 --> 32:39.280
Yes he is.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.760
Alice?

32:43.200 --> 32:45.720
-Alice?
-Yes, Dale.  I'm here honey

32:45.920 --> 32:47.440
There was an accident.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.400
I had an accident.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.120
Yes.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.840
Did i run over someone?

32:55.680 --> 32:58.240
Honey, please calm down.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.720
Did someone die?

33:03.880 --> 33:04.920
No.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.360
Nobody died.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.640
Just take a rest.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.880
Dr.  Rorish.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.520
Why did you do that?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.360
The finding indicated amphetamines.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.680
They always tell us
not to lie to patients.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.560
Why are you doing it now?
Just with him?

33:34.920 --> 33:35.960
I dont know.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.760
He's already paying
the ultimate price.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.480
I wanted mercy.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.440
What's happening?

33:57.320 --> 33:58.520
You are in the hospital

33:59.680 --> 34:00.880
Liver failure...

34:02.280 --> 34:04.880
This causes the veins in the
esophagus to swell and bleed.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.040
You almost died.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.840
We stopped the bleeding.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.679
But we have to watch
you for a while longer.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.920
Now...

34:19.239 --> 34:20.920
You think you are
better than me, don't you?

34:22.199 --> 34:23.639
But you are not.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.719
You're a con man
and everyone knows it.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.199
You are so disappointing.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.280
But right now I'm your doctor.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.800
Do you have a moment?

35:02.520 --> 35:04.320
-Clear.
-Come in guys.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.760
These are Captains Quinn and
Gibson of the US Medical Corps.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.280
New Prosthetics Department.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.000
It's a Pentagon program.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.480
They revolutionize prostheses

35:15.600 --> 35:16.600
with state-of-the-art solutions.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.160
Can we take it slow?
He needs some time.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.040
-What's this?
-The?

35:21.840 --> 35:24.240
This is a great next
generation robotic arm.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.680
It has 26 limbs

35:26.280 --> 35:27.800
can withstand up to 20 kilos,

35:28.040 --> 35:29.240
you control it with your

35:29.360 --> 35:30.520
head, like a regular arm.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.240
But i need a leg.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.800
We have legs.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.680
We have many legs.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.360
Captain Quinn?

35:55.440 --> 35:57.320
The antibiotics are working.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.960
Oh, you are not pregnant
in case you were unsure.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.560
Very funny.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.600
Explain it to me.
You were a...

36:04.920 --> 36:07.160
Straight man turned woman

36:07.560 --> 36:11.320
who is now a lesbian?
Do I understand that right?

36:11.440 --> 36:12.840
I've always loved women

36:13.720 --> 36:15.560
that didn't change
when I became one.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.760
And it's not that
complicated at all.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.800
It sounds like the
Pythagorean theorem to you.

36:22.000 --> 36:22.960
Fine

36:24.080 --> 36:25.080
I get it.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.680
There are some who
don't understand me either.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.840
What do you not understand?

36:33.080 --> 36:34.120
Everything.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.520
-Hi.
-Can you knock?

36:43.680 --> 36:44.840
It's a curtain.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.240
And...

36:48.520 --> 36:49.640
I'm so sorry.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.240
That's a lot at once.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.160
I'm so sorry.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.120
I wanted to tell you.
I was just scared.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.640
I wanted you to
see me for who I am

37:02.520 --> 37:05.440
not as the man the
world always saw me as.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.280
How could I have seen you?

37:12.480 --> 37:13.600
Do you know why i love you

37:14.120 --> 37:17.040
Because you're the first
person I feel real with.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.000
-Is that the other way around?
-Naturally.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.200
Wait... did you just
say you love me?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.400
Yes, silly.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.080
I love you too.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.360
We slept even during the war.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.280
Good night dr  Willis.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.240
-Will Charlotte make it?
-No idea.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.640
-Will Campbell fire you?
-I didn't say.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.240
They asked if she could do it.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.880
How many don't
make it into the army?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.200
Seven out of ten.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.400
It should be that way.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.200
There is too much
at stake, it has to be.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.200
They said she had what it takes.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.360
She did.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.880
Now let's see if she
has what it takes to stay.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.360
-What about you?
-What about me?

38:17.720 --> 38:18.920
Why are you here?

38:19.040 --> 38:20.520
I owe the army two years.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.480
They keep me working here
until my assignment is over.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.480
-How so?
-Long story.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.480
I'm not giving up on Charlotte.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.960
-Good.
-Good night.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.840
Night.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.960
Dr.  Piel.  You did it.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.720
Give us a moment

38:43.440 --> 38:44.440
Are you all right?

38:45.960 --> 38:47.520
I shouldn't be here.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.240
He'll talk to his team.
His doctors should be there.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.480
But I'm the reason we're here

38:53.640 --> 38:54.880
His leg was shattered.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.280
There was no way you
could have changed that.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.600
Nevertheless...

39:00.440 --> 39:02.960
People?  Are you coming

39:04.360 --> 39:05.400
Dr.  Piel...

39:06.200 --> 39:07.720
Your patient is asking about you.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.360
He didn't mean it that way.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.800
You're a nice guy, Angus.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.880
How can he be disappointed?
You are a doctor!
