but she's the newest full-time team member

taking Christine's desk?

The last thing I heard is Christine
is coming back to the office soon,

00:48.840 --> 00:51.134

to have Emma, the girl she doesn't like,

00:55.055 --> 00:58.349
and she has been hurt
for so many years, replacing her.

I found out about her
the day that I met her,

01:11.196 --> 01:12.614
and it was not pleasant.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.408
[Heather] So she was mean
to you from day one?

01:15.492 --> 01:18.495
I was leaving the gym
with who I thought was my boyfriend,

01:18.578 --> 01:23.583
and she pulled up with her friend,
and she was like, "Who the F is this?"

01:23.666 --> 01:27.378
And then started screaming,
"This is my boyfriend!"

01:27.462 --> 01:29.380
I tried to pull off in my car.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.841
She drove her car,
blocked my car so I couldn't move.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.761
Her and her friend were banging
on my windows, screaming,

01:34.844 --> 01:38.014
and I didn't know what to do,
and I just rolled down my window,

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
and she was screaming bloody murder.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.268
Then he comes out, starts screaming at her

01:42.352 --> 01:45.897
that she's crazy and to leave me alone,
because I did nothing wrong.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.525

01:48.608 --> 01:50.276

a bad introduction with Christine,

any problems or anything--

02:04.791 --> 02:05.708

02:05.792 --> 02:10.547

I said, "Why don't you talk to them?"

02:10.630 --> 02:13.216
Would be nice
to invite them to the baby shower.

-[laughing]
-[Mary] Right? I know!

02:15.093 --> 02:18.054
Right? I was like, "She missed me so much,
she excluded me?"

02:18.138 --> 02:21.015
She said you were friends
with someone that hurt her in the past.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.893
I was like, "So what happened?"

02:23.977 --> 02:24.936
She explained to me

02:25.019 --> 02:28.815
that it was some guy she dated
that was dating a woman at the same time.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.318
I said, "Well, maybe she doesn't know,
she didn't know,"

02:32.402 --> 02:34.362
because it happens all the time.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.572

for a very long time.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.117

02:39.200 --> 02:41.619
We were fine before
when I was still friends with her.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.037
That's an excuse.

02:44.414 --> 02:48.042
Right. I said, "Look, it's probably
just a communication problem."

02:48.126 --> 02:50.044
"Maybe you should even talk to Emma."

02:50.128 --> 02:52.589
That's the first time
Mary's heard that in five years.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.050
-[Mary] She's mad at Jason, but not you?
-Why is she not mad at me?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.553
-Maybe you didn't know the facts.
-I was living with…

02:58.636 --> 03:01.055
-I do know, but I'm not--
-So you know the timeline?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.308
-I know the timeline.
-Maybe you should ask.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.310
[Romain] She's having a baby
and she's married.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.811
-[Amanza] She had a baby.
-Right!

03:06.895 --> 03:08.271
I was living with her.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.941
At some point, you need to move on.
It's five years ago.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.486
-Oh, my God, like…
-[Vanessa] You don't know the story.

03:15.570 --> 03:20.325
[Mary] I do know the situation
And it's not what Christine is saying.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.242
It was...

03:21.326 --> 03:22.702
a different time period.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.245
There was no overlap.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.206
Maybe this is a good time for…

03:26.289 --> 03:29.584
Maybe you will have a conversation
where you can clear things with her,

03:29.667 --> 03:31.628
and it will be amazing. You never know.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.630
In life, everything is communication.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.925

Brett, Jason, you guys know that.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.760

03:38.843 --> 03:42.055
I didn't even know there was a recent ex
or anything along those lines.

[Emma] I got my real-estate license
a few years ago.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.726
I obviously was focusing
on other business ventures.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.479
Now I'm becoming
a bit more involved with real estate.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.481
Since all my other businesses
are thriving,

05:56.564 --> 05:59.609

to put everything into real estate.

some of Christine's.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.412

Do you know, like,
with little kids, and they go, "Ooh!"

06:28.388 --> 06:29.222
Right?

06:29.305 --> 06:32.058
-[Heather] "Ooh! Emma's here!"
-I don't know what just happened.

So obviously, you're bicoastal.
What do you do? What other businesses?

06:44.070 --> 06:47.657
So I started a food company,
but how I started that was

06:47.740 --> 06:50.827
I started investing
in the stock market at a really young age.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.329
-I was like 14, 15 years old.
-Wow!

06:53.413 --> 06:56.541

and when my grandfather passed away,

06:56.624 --> 06:57.959
we had a food company.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.087
It was really small,
so I lent my family money.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.630
I was 17 years old.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.382
-[Amanza] Oh, my God.
-Wow.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.093
For payroll and stuff,
just to get the company going.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.555
Now it's a national brand,
and then I wanted to start my own line…

07:10.638 --> 07:11.722

07:11.806 --> 07:14.392

07:14.475 --> 07:16.561
I bought a machine for the empanadas.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.439
-They were crab cake ones, right?
-Crab cakes?

07:20.064 --> 07:21.858
And then there were pizza ones?

07:23.234 --> 07:26.112
-Yeah, pizza and cheeseburger.
-[Mary] Cheeseburger, okay.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.738
In the empanada? I'm confused.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.157
[Emma] Cheeseburger empanadas.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.618
I know what empanadas are
and I love empanadas, don't get me wrong,

07:32.702 --> 07:34.120
but never in a million years

07:34.203 --> 07:38.291
I thought there could be, like,
cheeseburger empanadas and crab.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.418
They're not even empanadas.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.962
And then I have
a bunch of women that work for me

07:43.045 --> 07:45.965
that hand-make a lot
of the other items, which is cool.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.967
And then real estate too. Oh, my gosh.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.262
Just when I thought my life
is full with my kids, I'm like, "Um…"

07:51.345 --> 07:53.431
Yeah. That's why it's a perfect mix,

07:53.514 --> 07:56.976

Whole Foods, all these huge places

07:57.059 --> 07:59.061
with the CEOs and stuff like that.

Did you know that?

14:42.631 --> 14:44.550
Yeah. I knew. Jason told me.

14:44.633 --> 14:48.095
And she told the story of what happened
to everyone in the dinner,

14:48.178 --> 14:49.972
because I was asking her questions--

14:50.055 --> 14:51.724
She told everyone at the dinner?

14:51.807 --> 14:54.810
-No, I mean, I--
-God! Her own version, I'm sure too.

-[Vanessa] But, obviously… But, yeah…
-Ugh.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.273
But I exposed her too,
asking her in front of everyone,

14:59.356 --> 15:01.108
and maybe it's because I saw

15:01.191 --> 15:04.153
that you were in so much pain
from that experience.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.156
That you were super hurt with Mary,
because she's friends with her.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.991
So Mary and Jason were there too?

15:09.074 --> 15:12.578
-Yeah. I mean, we were at Jason's house.
-And what were they saying?

15:12.661 --> 15:16.415
I mean, they said that, you know,
like, she was telling the truth,

15:16.498 --> 15:18.167
that there was not an overlap.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.461
I understand that Mary
doesn't like me right now,

15:20.544 --> 15:23.672
but, at the time,
Mary was a good friend of mine.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.008
She was the first person
I called, actually.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.885
I called her crying.

15:27.968 --> 15:31.263
For Mary to say

15:31.347 --> 15:33.599
that Emma's story was true

15:33.682 --> 15:35.893
just infuriates me.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.519
She knew we were together.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.773
And Jason, like, knew we were together.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.401
I think it's extremely disrespectful
that Emma's telling

15:44.485 --> 15:47.279
a whole entire group
a story where I'm not even there,

15:47.363 --> 15:50.991
and I bet you if I was there,
she would've told this story different.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.036
So I really
just don't appreciate this right now.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.497
But then again, not everyone has class.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.915
So, what are you gonna do?

15:57.998 --> 16:01.210
You know, I'm sure
the story that she told you

16:01.293 --> 16:04.546
is from one position,
but I'll tell you my side,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.715
'cause at lunch,
I didn't get into details.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.135
You know,
I was dating him for two and a half years.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.013
-So you never broke up with him?
-Never. Never.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.641

you were dating him until that moment.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.309
-[Christine] Yeah. Yeah.
-[Vanessa] Wow.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.562
I'm very confused at the moment,
because listening to Emma's story

16:20.646 --> 16:22.773
and then listening to Christine's story

16:22.856 --> 16:27.319
is like, wow, I understand now
why Christine was so upset.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.281
He was at my house that morning,

16:32.032 --> 16:35.411
and he left, so I called my best friend,
and went to go pick her up.

16:35.494 --> 16:40.082
And here I see my boyfriend at the time

16:40.165 --> 16:43.252
walking with another girl,
and that happened to be Emma.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.045
And I was like, "Wait, what?"

16:45.129 --> 16:47.589
It took me a minute,
'cause I was dropping her off.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.384
I was like, "How are you?"
He freaked out, didn't know what to do.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.303
-Were they holding hands?
-They were holding hands, like…

16:53.387 --> 16:55.848
the whole thing,
and I was just like, "What?"

16:57.391 --> 16:59.768
Emma's car was, like, maybe ten feet away,

16:59.852 --> 17:02.855
and I got in my car, and I blocked her in,

17:02.938 --> 17:07.359
and I said, "I'm not sure
what this man is telling you,

17:07.443 --> 17:09.528
but that's my boyfriend."

17:09.611 --> 17:11.613
"I've been with him
for two and a half years,

17:11.697 --> 17:14.491
so I don't know when you guys
have had time to get together."

17:14.575 --> 17:17.786
Obviously, it's only during the day.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.331
And then they were engaged
two months after this happened.

I got fooled, Heather got fooled.

-Oh, Heather was dating him too!

-That was before?
-That was kind of after we broke up.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.279
Okay, I'm confused.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.449
So after you broke up,
he was dating Heather.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.366
Yeah.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.952
But then two months later,
he was engaged to Emma?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.412
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.582
What? [chuckles]

18:03.665 --> 18:05.459
Most of the time, when I'm speechless,

18:05.542 --> 18:07.628
it's because I cannot find
the word in English,

18:07.711 --> 18:10.339
but, honestly, we could be
speaking Spanish fluently now,

18:10.422 --> 18:12.800
and I would still not find a word to use.

20:27.392 --> 20:31.230
It was my first time meeting her,

It was just like "Oh."

"You didn't just wanna
get to know me, I guess."

Honestly, like, in the Vanessa situation,

20:46.286 --> 20:49.289
I have a little bit of, like, sympathy,

20:49.373 --> 20:52.459
because I remember being
the first new person in the group,

20:52.542 --> 20:56.463
and Christine talking
all this stuff about everyone to me,

20:56.546 --> 21:00.259
where I had to then decipher
what was the truth and what wasn't.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.594

It's the weirdest thing.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.674
So, what have you guys been up to?

27:55.757 --> 27:57.592
Who's been selling a house?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.261
[Jason] She's in escrow
for 6.3 on something.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.181
-Congrats! That's awesome!
-Thank you. Yeah, it's exciting.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.267
[Christine] At the end of the day,
I'm much classier than Emma.

28:06.351 --> 28:11.147
Unlike her, I don't feel the need
to drag our history in front of coworkers.

28:11.231 --> 28:15.819
All right, well, it is feeding time,
guys, so I'm gonna bounce,

28:15.902 --> 28:17.195
but don't get too comfortable.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.822
I'll be back.

28:18.905 --> 28:22.826
-[Heather] Where are you gonna sit?
-On the couch. It's way more comfortable.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.327
[Vanessa] You can sit with me too.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.664
I'd love to sit with you.
You bitches don't get too comfortable.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.207
[Heather laughs]

28:34.546 --> 28:36.673
-[Maya] That went smoothly.
-[Emma laughs]

28:36.756 --> 28:39.342
[Heather] Yeah.
How do you feel about everything?

28:39.426 --> 28:43.179
I've never given her a reaction before,
I've always been super nice and… You know?

28:43.263 --> 28:47.058
I knew how I was gonna be,
but it was like…

28:47.142 --> 28:49.269
I had no idea how she was gonna be.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.147
She said, "Nice to meet you."
We have met, but that's okay.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.065
-She said, "Nice to meet you"?
-Yeah.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.984
Leave it to Christine.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.319
Christine was nice and polite to Emma.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.114
Did she mean it? Probably not.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.199
I mean, probably the baby changed her.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.201
And I don't know her from before.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.704
I know her
from just a couple of weeks ago,

29:07.787 --> 29:11.750
and it's been nice so far,
so maybe it will happen the same with you.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.668
When there's a baby around! [laughs]

29:13.752 --> 29:15.420
We'll see if she'll change.
