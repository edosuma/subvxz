02:11.480 --> 02:13.540
Go away. Shoo, shoo!

02:20.200 --> 02:22.900
Hey! Child! Come back here.
Bring that back!

02:23.000 --> 02:23.967
Watch it!

02:24.080 --> 02:25.241
Stop!

02:34.080 --> 02:36.220
Ooh! Whoa!

02:36.320 --> 02:37.890
Little savage!

03:32.600 --> 03:34.648
Almitra!

03:35.880 --> 03:37.540
Almitra!

03:37.640 --> 03:39.980
Eggs, honey, fruit, nuts.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.380
Let's say, seven silver ones.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.220
What? Oh, yes, of course. Let me...

03:46.320 --> 03:47.540
Almitra!

03:47.640 --> 03:50.300
Quite a handful, your daughter, no?

03:50.400 --> 03:52.940
Actually, she's very sweet.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.169
Yes. Like lemons.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.731
With honey.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.380
That's four, five, six...

04:01.480 --> 04:03.660
Almitra! I mean it!

04:03.760 --> 04:05.125
...and seven.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.571
Almitra, get down from there!

04:08.680 --> 04:11.968
No, no, no. No, I mean, don't move!

04:12.800 --> 04:14.260
No, no, no.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.100
Easy, boy!

04:20.200 --> 04:21.361
Oh, dear!

04:22.280 --> 04:23.281
Oh!

04:24.560 --> 04:25.766
Are you all right?

04:26.440 --> 04:29.380
Not again. My dates, ruined.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.041
It's the mother's fault.
Letting her run wild like an animal.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.810
Sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.206
Here, here's some.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.524
This one's still good.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.081
These are okay.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.211
It will not happen again.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.566
It takes a village, no?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.003
An apology would be nice.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.660
I said I was sorry.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.242
No. From her. She's the one
causing all the trouble.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.580
You know she doesn't speak.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.260
Or won't.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.340
Not since her father died.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.091
Ugh. That was over two years ago.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.660
Look, I'll pay you later.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.730
All of you. At the end of the week,
when I get paid.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.401
And what about all she's stolen?

05:26.400 --> 05:29.370
My daughter is not a thief!

05:31.920 --> 05:33.206
That's what she says, yes.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.660
Hey, Almitra, look.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.161
We found the cat that got your tongue.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.966
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.660
Darling, pay no attention to them.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.683
They're just dumb kids.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.161
What's this?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.801
Eee!

06:09.200 --> 06:11.820
Baby, I know you miss your father.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.540
Me, too.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.326
And if I could bring him back, I would.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.169
But it's just us now.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.567
And you know what?
We're going to be all right.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.244
We just need to stick together.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.164
You know what I miss the most?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.002
Your voice.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.284
All right, my little one.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.001
It's school for you and work for me.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.083
Try to be good, okay?

07:38.640 --> 07:41.211
Oh. Please let it be a goat.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.020
Almitra.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.887
Why are you following me?
You know you're supposed to be in school.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.964
Well, there's no time
to take you all the way back,

07:58.080 --> 08:00.082
and I can't lose this job.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.260
I guess you're just going to
have to come with me.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.900
But listen.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.420
You better not take anything.
I'm serious, Almitra.

08:10.520 --> 08:15.401
In this family, we do not steal.
Understood?

08:24.440 --> 08:25.441
Oh!

08:39.919 --> 08:40.921
Ya!

08:48.760 --> 08:50.340
Good morning, Halim.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.521
Kamila.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.660
Morning, ma'am.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.660
Are you okay?

08:58.760 --> 09:00.000
Excellent.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.724
Oh. You've brought along some help today.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.380
Or perhaps you're a spy.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.020
Yeah, she's the leader of the Resistance.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.380
Excuse me.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.164
Wait! Don't go yet.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.020
I mean...

09:16.120 --> 09:19.820
I can't allow entry without
the appropriate documents.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.220
For the girl.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.926
What? Oh, come on, Halim.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.780
I don't have time for this.
I've got work to do.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.380
You know this prisoner
is a high security risk.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.450
A dangerous criminal.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.420
Why do you think they assigned
me to guard him?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.820
- I have no idea.
- Whoa, whoa!

09:38.920 --> 09:40.046
Hey.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.580
Fine. Then you can babysit her.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.160
She's very well behaved, by the way.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.651
Shouldn't give you any trouble at all.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.001
Uh...

10:01.200 --> 10:05.046
So, Almitra, what do you do for fun?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.401
Ahh!

10:08.120 --> 10:09.485
Geez!

10:12.200 --> 10:13.201
Hey!

10:13.800 --> 10:15.245
What did you say to him?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.162
Almost.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.961
Okay.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.660
This is great. I'm having a wonderful day!

10:32.920 --> 10:35.700
Hey, come back here. That's my hat.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.724
It's an official hat, you know.
It's a government hat.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.929
Come back here! Here, birdie, birdie...

11:27.320 --> 11:28.765
Do I hear a mouse?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.645
Careful, little mouse.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.402
There are traps everywhere.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.605
I never get visitors.
It'd be nice to have a chat,

11:41.200 --> 11:42.361
even with a mouse.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.323
Oh. Where did you go?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.009
Little mouse?

11:50.520 --> 11:53.444
Hmm. No. Not there.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.849
Ha-ha! I know. The cookie jar.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.131
Hello.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.801
Hmm.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.281
Mmm.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.180
Hmm.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.931
No. Not there either.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.561
Well...

12:20.000 --> 12:21.001
Hmm.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.567
A-ha! There you are!

12:23.880 --> 12:26.690
Oh. A mouse in a cage.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.803
Want a cookie, little mouse?

12:32.720 --> 12:33.721
Mmm.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.003
My name's Mustafa.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.801
What's yours?

12:44.320 --> 12:45.300
A-ha.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.882
Almitra. That's a pretty name.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.100
Well, Almitra,
there are all kinds of cages.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.683
This house has been mine for seven years.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.441
My crime?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.161
Poetry.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.641
Hmm.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.445
Oh. The lady with the mousetraps. Quick!

13:30.160 --> 13:33.130
We prisoners have to be sneaky.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.644
You know what's funny?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.881
They think I'm their prisoner,

13:41.520 --> 13:44.410
but I've flown away many times.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.811
Oh, yes.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.730
Right out that window.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.011
High above the whole island.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.244
Let me tell you a secret.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.691
We are not imprisoned by houses

14:00.440 --> 14:02.408
or our bodies.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.329
Not even by other people.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.800
We are spirits.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.924
Free as the wind.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.363
It's a secret not everyone knows.

14:58.040 --> 15:03.331
"I have seen people throw themselves
down and worship their own freedom

15:04.160 --> 15:06.481
"Like slaves before a tyrant

15:07.200 --> 15:10.010
"Praising him though he slays them

15:15.320 --> 15:17.527
"I have seen the freest among them

15:17.680 --> 15:19.808
"Wear their freedom as a handcuff

15:20.080 --> 15:22.780
"And my heart bled within me

15:22.880 --> 15:28.091
"For you can only be free when
You no longer speak of freedom as a goal

15:32.360 --> 15:34.100
"And how can you be free

15:34.200 --> 15:37.921
"Unless you break the chains
You have fastened around yourself?

15:41.960 --> 15:44.531
"In truth, that which you call freedom

15:44.640 --> 15:47.180
"Is the strongest of these chains

15:47.280 --> 15:50.250
"Though its links glitter in the sun

15:52.120 --> 15:54.521
"And to become free, what would you

15:54.680 --> 15:57.047
"Remove that is not a part of yourself?

15:59.560 --> 16:03.610
"If it's a tyrant
His throne was built within you

16:06.200 --> 16:08.885
"If it's a care you would cast off

16:09.040 --> 16:11.725
"That care has been chosen by you

16:13.320 --> 16:15.846
"And if it's a fear you would drive away

16:15.960 --> 16:18.486
"The root of that fear is in your heart

16:19.240 --> 16:21.811
"And not in the hand of the feared

16:38.720 --> 16:40.500
"These things move within you

16:40.600 --> 16:44.082
"As lights and shadows
In constant half embrace

16:49.040 --> 16:50.500
"You'll be free indeed

16:50.600 --> 16:53.020
"Not when your days are without a care

16:53.120 --> 16:54.804
"Nor your nights without grief

16:55.520 --> 16:59.100
"But rather when these things
Bind up your life

16:59.200 --> 17:01.487
"And yet you rise above them

17:02.320 --> 17:03.651
"Unbound"

17:13.119 --> 17:14.940
That's it! Where is he?

17:15.040 --> 17:17.099
I'd like to wring his
little feathered neck.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.440
Halim?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.290
Where is...

17:21.480 --> 17:23.368
Almitra.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.980
Didn't I tell you to stay out of trouble?

17:26.079 --> 17:28.970
Halim! You were supposed to babysit her!

17:30.280 --> 17:33.820
Oh, Mustafa, I'm so sorry my daughter
has interrupted your work.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.220
I'll just get her out of your way.
Don't worry.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.220
No, no, no. We're fine.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.846
We were just chatting. Right, Almitra?

17:42.640 --> 17:44.005
Chatting?

17:46.440 --> 17:50.525
Yes, we were sailing
on the wings of the wind.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.201
Mmm.

17:55.120 --> 18:00.860
That reminds me, last night
I had the sweetest dream.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.327
I dreamt of a ship
sailing into the harbor,

18:03.480 --> 18:05.847
coming to take me back to my homeland.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.260
Hmm.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.921
Halim, you haven't today,
by any chance, seen a ship?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.780
No,

18:12.880 --> 18:14.644
but to tell you the truth,
I wasn't looking.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.000
Mmm! Mmm!

18:16.360 --> 18:18.362
- Almitra, get down from there!
- Ahhh!

18:18.560 --> 18:20.085
Ooh!

18:20.200 --> 18:23.807
Oh! Mustafa, I'm so sorry!
I mean, Almitra is sorry.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.042
Oh! Here, let me...

18:26.560 --> 18:28.340
You do it.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.460
That must hurt so much.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.180
No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.648
Oh, no, no, no. Look at your painting.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.340
It's completely ruined.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.300
No, no. Not at all.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.100
In fact, it's improved.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.780
No, no, Mustafa, you cannot mean that.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.020
I do, I do!

18:47.120 --> 18:49.540
But it's so ugly. Look at it!

18:49.640 --> 18:50.700
Now, now, now.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.780
I don't know what to do.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.460
- Come and sit down. Here.
- I've tried everything!

18:53.560 --> 18:57.167
Nothing I do or say gets through to her.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.780
She's just completely beyond my control.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.769
Well, of course, she is.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.780
What?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.644
She doesn't belong to you.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.540
She doesn't?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Mustafa.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.300
I remember clearly that it was me

19:14.400 --> 19:16.100
who brought her into this world.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.140
Yes, yes, that's true.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.323
She came through you, but not from you.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.210
"Your children are not your children

19:26.000 --> 19:29.607
"They are the sons and daughters
Of Life's longing for itself"

19:30.480 --> 19:35.520
Your children are not your children

19:36.920 --> 19:41.448
They're the sons and daughters of
Life's longing for itself

19:43.600 --> 19:46.001
They come through you

19:47.200 --> 19:49.123
But not from you

19:50.280 --> 19:55.446
Though they're with you,
they belong to themselves

19:57.000 --> 20:02.086
You may give them your love,
but not your thoughts

20:03.960 --> 20:08.682
For they have thoughts of their own

20:10.320 --> 20:15.326
You may house their bodies,
not their souls

20:17.080 --> 20:21.369
For their souls
dwell in a house of tomorrow

20:22.960 --> 20:28.729
Which you cannot visit,
not even in your dreams

20:46.720 --> 20:49.166
You may strive

20:50.120 --> 20:52.088
To be like them

20:54.200 --> 20:58.842
But seek not to make them like you

21:00.720 --> 21:06.045
For life goes not backward

21:07.520 --> 21:12.208
Nor tarries with yesterday

21:13.560 --> 21:20.020
You are the bows from which your children

21:20.120 --> 21:26.002
As living arrows are sent forth

21:27.440 --> 21:33.780
The archer sees the mark
upon the path of the infinite

21:33.880 --> 21:38.841
And He bends you with His might

21:40.520 --> 21:45.924
That His arrows may go swift and far

22:16.880 --> 22:23.300
Let your bending in the archer's hand
be for gladness

22:23.400 --> 22:26.165
For even as he loves the arrow that flies

22:26.280 --> 22:30.080
He loves the bow that is stable

22:30.200 --> 22:36.500
Let your bending in the archer's hand
be for gladness

22:36.600 --> 22:39.500
For even as he loves the arrow that flies

22:39.600 --> 22:44.288
He loves the bow that is stable

23:09.880 --> 23:12.690
"For even as he loves the arrow that flies

23:13.520 --> 23:17.206
"So He loves also the bow that is stable"

23:21.000 --> 23:23.367
- Halim!
- Ow! Ohh!

23:37.160 --> 23:40.860
Sergeant, to what do I owe this honor?

23:40.960 --> 23:45.420
I've come to inform you that you
are released from your confinement.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.887
What? Released?

23:50.560 --> 23:54.121
But we should throw a party, with music.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.608
Released, released.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.681
Mustafa!

24:03.240 --> 24:05.140
You are released on the condition

24:05.240 --> 24:07.300
that you return to your own country

24:07.400 --> 24:10.085
and never again set foot on Orphalese.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.180
Oh.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.487
If Halim is up to it...

24:14.680 --> 24:16.967
Hmm!

24:17.080 --> 24:19.900
...we will escort you to
your port of emigration.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.047
Now.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.529
What, now?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.161
Oh.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.460
Well, I'll help you pack up your things.
All your work.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.580
No, you'll clean up and then leave.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.700
We will deal with his
personal effects later.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.260
Sergeant, come on now.
Surely, there's time to gather...

24:39.360 --> 24:40.780
You will come with us now.

24:40.880 --> 24:45.568
Unless you want to remain locked up
here for another seven years.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.731
Hmm-hmm.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.490
Difficult decision, that one.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.140
Here is your final pay.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.244
After today, your services
are no longer required.

24:57.160 --> 25:02.041
I'm so sorry, Kamila.
I hope that you will find work soon.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.323
Your visits have been
a bright spot in my time here.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.620
Goodbye.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.246
Thank you, Mustafa, for everything.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.761
Ugh.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.660
And please say goodbye
to my new friend, Almitra.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.967
I wish we had had more time.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.886
What?

25:23.880 --> 25:24.881
Mmm.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.300
Ha!

25:27.400 --> 25:31.020
I should have known. The silent thief.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.060
You're developing quite the reputation
at the marketplace.

25:34.160 --> 25:38.620
Don't think you're too young to spend
a few nights in jail, my friend.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.449
Heh! And you, too!

25:42.240 --> 25:43.241
Ow!

25:44.280 --> 25:45.281
Rat traps!

25:47.280 --> 25:48.441
Halim!

25:53.200 --> 25:54.770
Almitra, no!

25:56.000 --> 25:57.729
You heard the Sergeant.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.802
We can't afford any more trouble.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.289
I know, I know. I'm gonna miss him, too.

26:14.560 --> 26:18.167
All right, I guess I'd better finish up.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.060
Look! It's the poet!

27:12.160 --> 27:13.286
Mustafa?

27:13.400 --> 27:14.460
Is he free?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.050
It's been so long.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.620
Mustafa!

27:19.720 --> 27:21.620
- Have you been freed?
- Where are they taking you?

27:21.720 --> 27:24.420
To the harbor. This is a happy day.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.620
For all of you, of course, but for me too!

27:26.720 --> 27:29.020
I'm being released. I'm going home.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.980
- Great!
- Wonderful!

27:31.080 --> 27:33.180
Then you must join us in celebrating!

27:33.280 --> 27:36.020
Absolutely not!
We have a schedule to stick to.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.980
Sergeant! You don't
like braised lamb shank?

27:42.400 --> 27:45.940
All right. Five minutes, not a moment longer!

27:46.040 --> 27:47.451
Yes, yes, thank you.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.620
Strike up the band.
We have two occasions to celebrate.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.100
Kissing. That's all he knows.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.089
Give her time to eat, for heaven's sake.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.081
Mmm.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.860
They're newlyweds. That's what
they're supposed to do, right?

28:06.960 --> 28:10.060
Who knows? The last time
I kissed a pretty girl,

28:10.160 --> 28:13.164
the Dead Sea was only sick.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.660
- Enough.
- Grandpa.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.761
Oh.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.446
Thank you.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.820
I've missed this!

28:29.920 --> 28:32.060
A toast to the happy couple!

28:32.160 --> 28:34.060
And for Mustafa!

28:34.160 --> 28:36.242
To love and freedom!

28:36.360 --> 28:38.700
To love and freedom!

28:38.800 --> 28:40.962
To freedom!

28:42.800 --> 28:44.040
To love?

28:44.600 --> 28:45.700
Mustafa,

28:45.800 --> 28:49.620
please, would you give a blessing
to my daughter's marriage?

28:49.720 --> 28:52.087
It would be my honor.

28:54.920 --> 28:59.847
"You were born together
And together you shall be forevermore

29:11.040 --> 29:15.602
"You shall be together when
The white wings of death scatter your days

29:26.320 --> 29:31.451
"Yes, you shall be together
Even in the silent memory of God

29:55.080 --> 29:58.926
"But let there be spaces
In your togetherness

30:01.200 --> 30:04.727
"And let the winds of the heavens
Dance between you

30:06.040 --> 30:10.409
"Love one another
But make not a bond of love

30:15.240 --> 30:17.540
"Let it rather be a moving sea

30:17.640 --> 30:20.120
"Between the shores of your souls

30:25.600 --> 30:29.969
"Fill each other's cup
But drink not from one cup

30:35.240 --> 30:37.660
"Give one another of your bread

30:37.760 --> 30:39.922
"But eat not from the same loaf

30:53.440 --> 30:57.500
"Sing and dance together and be joyous

30:57.600 --> 30:59.807
"But let each one of you be alone

31:09.280 --> 31:13.100
"Even as the strings of a lute are alone

31:13.200 --> 31:14.820
"Though they quiver with the same music

31:30.720 --> 31:34.725
"Give your hearts
But not into each other's keeping

31:35.960 --> 31:39.328
"For only the hand of Life
Can contain your hearts

32:11.560 --> 32:16.361
"And stand together
Yet not too near together

32:20.840 --> 32:23.730
"For the pillars of the temple stand apart

32:25.960 --> 32:27.940
"And the oak tree and the cypress

32:28.040 --> 32:30.168
"Grow not in each other's shadow"

32:34.760 --> 32:37.660
- Thank you, Mustafa.
- It was lovely.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.250
My pleasure.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.521
Ha-ha!

32:58.080 --> 33:00.220
I said "five minutes."

33:00.320 --> 33:03.140
And you've taken advantage
of my generosity.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.844
- Let's go. Now!
- Oh!

33:04.960 --> 33:05.980
Killjoy.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.260
Goodbye, everybody.
And good luck to the two of you.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.648
And thank you, Mustafa, for our blessing.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.802
Again with the kissing.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.641
Come here.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.580
Goodbye, Mustafa.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.045
Goodbye!

33:23.240 --> 33:26.483
Ah! It's a beautiful day for sailing.

33:26.600 --> 33:30.620
If Mustafa sets foot
on that ship, I'll eat my fez!

33:30.720 --> 33:32.290
Take care of yourself.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.128
Goodbye, good people. Goodbye!

33:36.240 --> 33:37.340
Safe journey!

33:37.440 --> 33:38.441
Farewell!

33:40.520 --> 33:42.648
My cake!

33:47.160 --> 33:48.810
I'll stick with the baklava.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.020
Those foolish peasants.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.700
They hang on your every word.

34:00.800 --> 34:05.740
After all this time, they still see you
as their great leader.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.740
With all due respect, Sergeant,

34:07.840 --> 34:09.659
they're neither foolish nor peasants.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.699
And I'm no leader.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.768
What, then? A teacher?

34:14.960 --> 34:16.460
What is a teacher?

34:16.560 --> 34:19.340
He can only lead you
to the threshold of your own mind.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.500
We all stand alone
in our understanding, Sergeant.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.045
You and I.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.721
You hear that, Mustafa?
That's who the people are.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.208
Sheep, waiting to be led
by the strongest...

34:36.760 --> 34:37.761
Ow!

34:40.280 --> 34:42.647
Are you, uh, all right, sir?

34:44.840 --> 34:46.409
Who did that? Hmm?

34:46.520 --> 34:47.780
Well, Sergeant,

34:47.880 --> 34:51.679
I suppose even the sheep
have the last word, sometimes.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.045
Whoa!

34:54.920 --> 34:56.159
Good boy.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.481
Well,

35:22.640 --> 35:24.210
I did...

35:27.760 --> 35:29.569
Huh? Huh! Oh!

35:31.680 --> 35:32.660
Huh?

35:32.760 --> 35:33.761
Oh!

35:36.600 --> 35:37.620
You see?

35:37.720 --> 35:38.860
Mustafa?

35:38.960 --> 35:40.086
It's him.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.685
Hurry.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.081
Mustafa?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.206
Mustafa.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.402
Ooh!

36:04.680 --> 36:05.660
Oh!

36:05.760 --> 36:06.761
Ugh.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.481
Oh!

36:33.600 --> 36:35.364
Oh! Ho! Ho!

36:41.240 --> 36:42.340
- Oh, my!
- Are you okay?

36:42.440 --> 36:43.900
That was a close one.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.900
It's all right, it's all right, I...

36:46.000 --> 36:47.620
Oh, I am fine, thanks.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.540
- Welcome back.
- Good to see you again.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.540
- How's your wife?
- We missed you.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.540
How are the children?

36:54.640 --> 36:56.700
So big now you wouldn't recognize them.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.980
That's terrific.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.241
So glad you're back.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.169
Yes, yes, yes.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.660
We're all pleased as punch
to see Mustafa again.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.780
But it's time to get back to
whatever it is you people do.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.700
That's right, Gramps.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.580
Your olives aren't going to
press themselves, are they?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.460
You've important work to do.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.740
Oh, no, sir.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.860
His words are worth
more than my sacks of olives.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.100
Nonsense, my friend.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.380
Oh! It's true, Mustafa.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.140
I don't know how I could have

37:24.240 --> 37:26.660
gotten through that terrible drought year

37:26.760 --> 37:29.260
without your words to reassure me.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.260
Or us, when our child was ill.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.011
Or me, putting up with my mother-in-law.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.860
Truly, your work means more than ours.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.041
Oh, shut up!

37:43.760 --> 37:46.081
Oh, dear, let me help you.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.647
My friend, all work is noble.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.842
"You work that you may keep pace

37:57.960 --> 38:01.089
"With the earth and the soul of the earth

38:06.680 --> 38:10.660
"For to be idle is to become
A stranger unto the seasons

38:10.760 --> 38:12.940
"And to step out of life's procession

38:13.040 --> 38:18.126
"That marches in majesty
And proud submission towards the infinite

38:25.320 --> 38:27.620
"When you work you are a flute

38:27.720 --> 38:32.248
"Through whose heart
The whispering of the hours turns to music

38:49.200 --> 38:53.860
"And when you work with love
You bind yourself to yourself

38:53.960 --> 38:57.248
"And to one another, and to God

39:01.240 --> 39:03.766
"And what is it to work with love?

39:10.960 --> 39:15.180
"It is to weave the cloth
With threads drawn from your heart

39:15.280 --> 39:18.329
"Even as if your beloved
Were to wear that cloth

39:31.120 --> 39:33.860
"It is to build a house with affection

39:33.960 --> 39:37.806
"Even as if your beloved
Were to dwell in that house

39:46.480 --> 39:52.044
"It is to sow seeds with tenderness
And reap the harvest with joy

39:52.160 --> 39:55.004
"Even as if your beloved
were to eat the fruit

39:59.120 --> 40:01.500
"It is to charge all things you fashion

40:01.600 --> 40:04.524
"With a breath of your own spirit

40:08.840 --> 40:11.940
"And to know that all the blessed dead

40:12.040 --> 40:15.123
"Are standing about you and watching

40:21.800 --> 40:25.566
"Often I have heard you say
As if speaking in sleep

40:26.520 --> 40:28.940
"'One who works in marble, and finds

40:29.040 --> 40:31.780
"The shape of their own soul in the stone

40:31.880 --> 40:34.770
"'Is nobler than one who plows the soil

40:44.640 --> 40:46.500
"'And one who seizes the rainbow

40:46.600 --> 40:49.620
"'To lay it on a cloth
in the likeness of man

40:49.720 --> 40:53.247
"'Is more than one who makes
The sandals for our feet'

41:01.040 --> 41:07.286
"But I say, not in sleep
But in the over-wakefulness of noontide

41:07.400 --> 41:11.300
"That the wind speaks
Not more sweetly to the giant oaks

41:11.400 --> 41:15.450
"Than it does to
the smallest blades of grass

41:17.480 --> 41:21.700
"And they are great, who turn
the voice of the wind into a song

41:21.800 --> 41:24.371
"Made sweeter by their own loving

41:33.280 --> 41:37.410
"Work is love made visible"

41:49.160 --> 41:52.500
Well, that was lovely, wasn't it?
Very edifying.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.300
But we need to be moving along.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.420
What's the hurry? He's just been released.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.000
Yes, we haven't seen him for years.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.300
Where are you taking him?
I thought he was free.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.060
I am free, my friends.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.300
Today, I'm being sent home to my country.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.688
I must admit, it will be good
to see my home again.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.460
Please, sir.

42:12.560 --> 42:16.340
Before you go,
I insist we serve you a proper meal.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.180
Yes, everyone knows

42:18.280 --> 42:20.380
the food on those ships is terrible.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.700
Come. Sit.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.980
Out of the way, out of the way,
people. Come on.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.084
Bashira! The best for Mustafa.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.180
Oh!

42:29.440 --> 42:31.700
And you'll need provisions for your trip.

42:31.800 --> 42:32.980
Have some oranges.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.206
Some pistachios.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.820
Now just one minute. I'm in charge here!

42:36.920 --> 42:39.810
And I say whether...
Ooh. Is that fresh halvah?

42:42.280 --> 42:43.540
Mmm.

42:43.640 --> 42:44.860
Oh! Oh!

42:44.960 --> 42:48.123
All right, five minutes.
And not a moment longer.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.020
What generosity! Enough, enough!

42:58.120 --> 42:59.900
Thank you, dear people.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.660
Thank you for the gifts of your labor,

43:02.760 --> 43:06.003
and thanks to the earth for its gifts.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.900
"Would that you could live
From the fragrance of the earth

43:14.000 --> 43:17.527
"And like an airplant
Be sustained by the light

43:25.840 --> 43:28.260
"But since we must kill to eat

43:28.360 --> 43:30.522
"Then let it be an act of worship

44:02.520 --> 44:07.287
"When you gather the grapes
For the winepress, say in your heart

44:08.480 --> 44:10.780
"'I too am a vineyard

44:10.880 --> 44:14.202
"'And my fruit shall be gathered
For the winepress

44:15.440 --> 44:19.001
"'And the wine shall be kept
In eternal vessels'

44:34.040 --> 44:36.725
"And when you crush an apple
With your teeth

44:38.160 --> 44:40.288
"Say to it in your heart

44:45.600 --> 44:48.206
"'Your seeds shall live in my body

44:49.120 --> 44:52.727
"'And the buds of your tomorrow
Shall blossom in my heart

45:07.280 --> 45:13.128
"'Your blood and my blood is the sap
That feeds the tree of heaven

45:19.760 --> 45:23.651
"'And together we shall rejoice
Through all the seasons"'

45:37.640 --> 45:39.460
Thank you, friends.

45:39.560 --> 45:42.643
I'll miss you. I'll miss you all.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.380
Watch him. I'll be back in a moment.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.620
Right!

45:48.720 --> 45:49.881
What...

45:54.880 --> 45:57.167
No, listen... Listen to me!

45:57.720 --> 46:01.580
He's a danger, and his influence
continues to grow.

46:01.680 --> 46:05.366
I need at least five men here
and more when we get there.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.660
No, he doesn't suspect anything.

46:09.760 --> 46:12.525
But the people... There may be resistance.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.930
Oh, yes, the Pasha will know
how to handle Mustafa.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.207
Hey!

46:21.040 --> 46:24.203
It's you! Open this door at once!

46:28.000 --> 46:29.684
Mmm. Mmm!

46:30.040 --> 46:31.041
Oh!

46:32.760 --> 46:34.091
So true.

46:34.680 --> 46:40.608
Mustafa, my friend, we feed the body,
but you, you feed the soul.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.860
Sir? May I have a word with you?

46:43.960 --> 46:46.620
"Sir"? After seven years?

46:46.720 --> 46:50.042
Please, Halim. Here, have some wine.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.060
Is something troubling you, Halim?

47:01.160 --> 47:03.620
No! No, no, no. I was just...

47:03.720 --> 47:05.404
Yes, there is.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.820
Yes? Go on.

47:07.920 --> 47:12.940
I know everyone sees me
as this self-assured, dauntless,

47:13.040 --> 47:15.580
impenetrable fortress of strength.

47:15.680 --> 47:16.681
Ahh!

47:17.960 --> 47:19.580
But, um...

47:19.680 --> 47:22.660
...the truth is, and this
might surprise you,

47:22.760 --> 47:26.420
I actually have one thing
that fills me with fear.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.284
And that is?

47:32.520 --> 47:35.171
Expressing feelings of love.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.364
Ah. Love.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.645
For Kamila?

47:42.120 --> 47:43.451
You knew?

47:46.960 --> 47:52.860
I see her lovely face every day,

47:52.960 --> 47:55.180
but I have no idea how she feels.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.820
I mean, perhaps she's intimidated
by my status, my authority.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.809
Intimidated? Your...

48:02.240 --> 48:05.620
No. No, no, no, no.
Don't let that worry you.

48:05.720 --> 48:08.540
Good. Okay. Good.

48:08.640 --> 48:12.260
But now that you're leaving, I mean,
she won't be coming around anymore.

48:12.360 --> 48:15.220
And if I don't do something soon,

48:15.320 --> 48:18.100
I might just lose her forever!
What will I do?

48:18.200 --> 48:20.740
I just... I mean, what can I do?

48:20.840 --> 48:22.842
- Halim, Halim.
- I... I...

48:22.960 --> 48:23.980
Yes?

48:24.080 --> 48:26.765
You're mangling that mango.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.500
Oh... Ha-ha.

48:29.600 --> 48:31.900
So I am.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.220
Halim, when love
beckons to you, follow him,

48:36.320 --> 48:39.164
though his ways are hard and steep.

48:42.840 --> 48:45.810
When love beckons to you

48:47.520 --> 48:48.885
Follow him

48:52.120 --> 48:56.762
Though his ways are hard and steep

49:01.400 --> 49:06.884
And when his wings enfold you,
yield to him

49:10.800 --> 49:15.647
Though he hides a sword among them

49:20.080 --> 49:23.163
And when he speaks to you

49:24.680 --> 49:26.125
Believe in him

49:29.640 --> 49:34.726
Though his voice may shatter your dreams

49:38.040 --> 49:42.500
Love will crown and crucify you

49:42.600 --> 49:47.128
And though for your growth
so he is for your pruning

49:47.440 --> 49:51.923
Love will caress your tenderest branches

49:52.400 --> 49:56.086
And shake every clinging root

49:57.480 --> 50:03.408
Like sheaves of corn
he gathers you unto himself

50:06.720 --> 50:12.090
He threshes and sifts you
He grinds and he kneads you

50:15.920 --> 50:22.405
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire

50:25.280 --> 50:32.004
That you may become sacred bread
for God's sacred feast

50:34.280 --> 50:38.780
All these things shall love do unto you

50:38.880 --> 50:43.180
That you may know
the secrets of your heart

50:43.280 --> 50:48.540
And in that knowledge become a fragment

50:48.640 --> 50:52.645
A fragment of Life's heart

50:53.480 --> 50:59.283
Now if in your fear you seek
only love's peace and love's pleasure

51:02.800 --> 51:08.887
Better cover your nakedness
And pass out of love's threshing-floor

51:11.640 --> 51:15.690
Into a seasonless world
where you shall laugh

51:15.800 --> 51:18.610
But not all your laughter

51:21.320 --> 51:27.680
And weep and weep,
but not all of your tears

51:30.360 --> 51:35.241
Love gives naught but itself

51:35.360 --> 51:39.380
And takes naught but from itself

51:39.480 --> 51:44.500
Love possesses not
nor would it be possessed

51:44.600 --> 51:48.685
For love is enough

51:54.520 --> 52:00.260
You should say, "I am in the heart of God"

52:00.360 --> 52:04.860
You cannot direct the course of Love

52:04.960 --> 52:11.889
If Love, it finds you worthy,
directs your course

52:13.640 --> 52:18.340
To wake at dawn with a winged heart

52:18.440 --> 52:22.940
To come home in the evening with gratitude

52:23.040 --> 52:27.820
Then to sleep with a prayer
for the beloved in your heart

52:27.920 --> 52:33.540
And a song of praise on your lips

52:33.640 --> 52:37.380
"And then to sleep with a prayer
for the beloved in your heart

52:37.480 --> 52:40.609
"And a song of praise upon your lips"

52:41.560 --> 52:42.561
Ah!

52:47.120 --> 52:49.088
Ah! Caught you.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.540
Yes.

52:51.640 --> 52:55.770
Excuse me, have you met my friend?
Her name is Almitra.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.042
Your friend, you say. Oh.

52:59.440 --> 53:01.408
We have met, yes.

53:06.960 --> 53:10.620
Oh, good, I'll feel better
knowing she has friends

53:10.720 --> 53:12.768
to look after her when I'm gone.

53:14.160 --> 53:15.810
What is it, Yousef?

53:16.760 --> 53:18.340
It's just that, you see...

53:18.440 --> 53:22.700
Well, it can be hard to get to know
someone who refuses to speak.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.167
I can see how that might be.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.961
On the other hand,

53:27.920 --> 53:32.642
sometimes people talk when they cease
to be at peace with their thoughts.

53:33.280 --> 53:35.060
But there are those who have the truth

53:35.160 --> 53:38.801
within them, only they
tell it not in words.

53:39.520 --> 53:44.924
In the heart of these,
the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.325
Oh. How did you...

54:08.440 --> 54:12.380
And if I find that little ruffian,
I'll throw her in irons!

54:12.480 --> 54:15.211
Break time's over.
Come on, let's get a move on.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.900
- Shh.
- Oh. Don't leave now.

54:17.000 --> 54:17.940
Mustafa, please.

54:18.040 --> 54:20.281
You just got here, for Pete's sake.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.460
Come on. Move it, move it.

54:21.560 --> 54:22.580
Please step away!

54:22.680 --> 54:24.580
Go on, go on, let's break this up!

54:24.680 --> 54:25.820
Enough of this.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.900
Get up. We haven't got all day.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.060
Sorry, sir. You're right.
That ship won't wait forever.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.926
Mustafa, sir, food for your voyage
from all your friends here.

54:35.040 --> 54:39.220
Come on, Mustafa.
Time to leave all your admirers.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.846
Go with God. We will miss you.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.140
- Goodbye!
- Come back to us.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.220
Goodbye! Take care of yourself.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.980
Stay here in the cafe, okay?

54:48.080 --> 54:50.321
You'll be safe until
I can find your mother.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.940
- Safe travels!
- Thank you, everybody! Thank you!

54:53.040 --> 54:54.100
Goodbye!

54:54.200 --> 54:55.201
Goodbye!

54:59.720 --> 55:03.380
There you are! I have
looked all over for you!

55:03.480 --> 55:04.620
Huh? Kamila.

55:04.720 --> 55:08.725
Oh, no, just tell me what I owe you,
and let's be done with it.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.380
My dear lady, no, no. Everything is fine.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.687
You owe me nothing.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.601
Okay.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.605
Thank you.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.324
I have been out of my mind with worry.

55:23.720 --> 55:24.980
Mmm!

55:25.080 --> 55:26.980
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

55:27.080 --> 55:31.369
I've lost Mustafa today.
I am not losing you to a police cell!

55:33.320 --> 55:35.220
What, what? What do you want?

55:35.320 --> 55:37.140
So help me, Almitra, don't test...

55:41.760 --> 55:42.761
Mmm.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.450
What is it?

55:48.760 --> 55:52.526
Do you know what's going on?
Because I sure don't.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.765
Goodbye, Mustafa!

56:02.320 --> 56:03.380
Look, it's him.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.060
- There he is!
- Yay!

56:05.160 --> 56:06.491
Mustafa!

56:11.320 --> 56:12.940
One minute, Mustafa.

56:13.040 --> 56:17.540
There are some details
to be attended to at headquarters.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.529
Please. Come with me.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.180
I had no idea.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.248
Of course not, Halim.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.004
Very well, Sergeant.

56:29.480 --> 56:31.740
- Hey, where are you taking him?
- Please step away.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.380
What are you doing? The ship is this way.

56:33.480 --> 56:34.740
Nothing to see here!

56:34.840 --> 56:36.060
Where is he going?

56:36.160 --> 56:37.260
Let him go!

56:37.360 --> 56:39.060
What's going on?

56:39.160 --> 56:40.180
Ludicrous!

56:40.280 --> 56:41.420
I can't believe this!

56:41.520 --> 56:42.620
I thought he was free!

56:42.720 --> 56:44.340
No, he was free!

56:44.440 --> 56:46.169
Almitra, you knew?

56:47.560 --> 56:49.820
- Let him go!
- He's done nothing wrong!

56:49.920 --> 56:51.060
This is an outrage!

56:51.160 --> 56:52.180
Out of our way.

56:52.280 --> 56:53.611
No! Bring him back!

56:53.720 --> 56:55.460
- Please step away!
- Return to your homes!

56:55.560 --> 56:56.780
- Make way.
- He is an innocent man!

56:56.880 --> 56:58.723
Almitra, no!

56:58.840 --> 56:59.841
Ahh!

57:00.320 --> 57:01.845
Almitra!

57:03.160 --> 57:04.220
More men over here!

57:04.320 --> 57:05.620
Move these people!

57:05.720 --> 57:07.404
Watch it! Careful!

57:08.160 --> 57:11.130
There! The girl! Get her!

57:13.560 --> 57:14.580
Leave her alone!

57:14.680 --> 57:15.727
You swine!

57:18.960 --> 57:20.166
Almitra.

57:21.160 --> 57:22.571
- No!
- Wait!

57:23.680 --> 57:24.806
Clear the square!

57:24.920 --> 57:26.160
- Return to your homes!
- Ahh!

57:27.720 --> 57:30.724
Clear the area! This is your last warning!

57:30.840 --> 57:32.420
Let me help you disappear into the crowd.

57:32.520 --> 57:34.780
The people won't give you away. Quickly!

57:34.880 --> 57:36.848
Thank you, Halim. But I won't put you...

57:40.200 --> 57:41.725
Ahhh!

57:44.560 --> 57:46.881
No, Sergeant. Let me help.

57:49.400 --> 57:53.540
People of Orphalese!
My friends, I beg you!

57:53.640 --> 57:55.802
Please! Be calm!

57:58.200 --> 57:59.300
But they're taking you!

57:59.400 --> 58:00.460
They're liars!

58:00.560 --> 58:01.860
They're evil!

58:01.960 --> 58:05.407
Let us not be too quick
to call others evil.

58:06.360 --> 58:13.005
"For what is evil but good tortured
By its own hunger and thirst?

58:17.800 --> 58:23.842
"Truly when good is hungry
It seeks food even in dark caves

58:26.280 --> 58:30.922
"And when it thirsts
It drinks even of dead waters

58:36.360 --> 58:39.860
"You are good
When you strive to give of yourself

58:39.960 --> 58:44.488
"Yet you are not evil
When you seek gain for yourself

58:45.440 --> 58:47.260
"For when you strive for gain

58:47.360 --> 58:52.082
"You are but a root that clings to the earth
And sucks at her breast

58:53.840 --> 58:56.860
"Surely the fruit cannot say to the root

58:56.960 --> 59:01.940
"'Be like me, ripe and full
And ever giving of your abundance'

59:02.040 --> 59:04.860
"For the fruit giving is a need

59:04.960 --> 59:07.804
"As receiving is a need for the root

59:26.040 --> 59:28.691
"You are good
When you are one with yourself

59:32.640 --> 59:37.806
"Yet when you are not one with yourself
You are not evil

59:51.560 --> 59:57.100
"A ship without a rudder may wander
aimlessly among perilous isles

59:57.200 --> 59:59.567
"Yet not sink to the bottom

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.900
"You are good when you walk
to your goal with bold steps

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.164
"Yet you are not evil when you go limping

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.683
"Even those who limp do not go backward

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.761
"Pity that the stags
Cannot teach swiftness to the turtles

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.900
"But you who are strong and swift

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.562
"See that you do not limp before the lame
Deeming it kindness

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.202
"In your longing for your greater self
Lies your goodness

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.700
"But in some of you, that longing
is a torrent rushing with might to the sea

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.930
"Carrying the secrets of the hillsides
And the songs of the forest

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.580
"While in others, it is a flat stream

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.980
"That loses itself in angles and bends

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.924
"And lingers before it reaches the shore

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.691
"In our longing for our greater selves
Lies our goodness

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.688
"And that longing is in all of us"

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.765
So, Mustafa.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.020
Your first day of freedom,
and you bring a riot to our doorstep.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.283
It was your men and their billy clubs
that brought on the riot.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.731
Order in the streets must be maintained.
Otherwise, anarchy.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.180
I'm disappointed to see your presence

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.740
is just as incendiary
as it was seven years ago.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.740
Did your stay on the mountain
give you no time for reflection?

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.300
Quite a bit, thanks.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.140
Then why do you persist with these

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.900
treasonous acts and rebellious speeches?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.209
Treasonous? I have only spoken with love.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.729
Oh. Only love and flowers, was it?

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.780
I believe this is yours.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.420
"Pity the nation that raises not its voice

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.060
"Save when it walks in a funeral

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.260
"Boasts not except among its ruins

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.580
"And will not rebel until its neck

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.365
"Is laid between the sword and the block"

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.100
"Love and flowers."

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.060
Nothing less than a call to rebellion!

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.300
I don't see it that way.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.721
Apparently, we disagree.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.364
It would, indeed, be tragic
if rash words from the past

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.580
prevented you from returning
to your beloved homeland.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.340
You mean, there's still a chance
I may go home?

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.940
A chance? A certainty.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.567
We are not vindictive.
We are not barbarians.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.970
Simply do this.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.300
Sign this statement
that your writings, your teachings,

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.361
were the product of a misguided
youth and are seditious.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.600
That you reject them now, they are false,
and you hold the State blameless

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.167
in its duty to preserve
the peace, etc., etc.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.180
I can't do that.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.980
Of course you can.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.644
Here is your opportunity to be repentant
and for us to be magnanimous.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.286
What would I have left
if I disavowed all that I believe?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.364
Your life, for one.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.287
I remind you, Mustafa,
the penalty for treason is death.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.649
Fine, have it your way.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.940
I'll give you the night in prison
to think it over.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.371
Guard!

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.486
Now!

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.846
Mmm. Mmm!

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.171
How in the world do we get up there?

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.120
Almitra?

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.249
What are you doing up there?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.525
You should go.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.249
There's only trouble here.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.211
Only trouble.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.051
You... You can fly.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.371
What?

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.686
What did you say?

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.411
You can fly away.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.170
Like you did before.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.689
If only I could.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.380
But you said!

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.165
Not houses, not bodies.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.045
Spirit.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.846
Yes.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.726
Spirit.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.204
Okay. Come on.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.847
Come out. Fly away.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.580
Almitra, I'm afraid

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.889
I'm going to have to stay here
and face what comes.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.043
But they might do bad things to you.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.681
No! You might die!

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.731
Dear Almitra, we don't need
to be afraid of death.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.042
"For life and death are one

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.125
"Even as the river and the sea are one

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.900
"How would we know the secret of death

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.480
"Unless we look for it
in the heart of life?

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.020
"The owl whose night-bound eyes
Are blind in the day

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.691
"Cannot unveil the mystery of light

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.900
"In the depth of your hopes and desires

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.731
"Lies your silent knowledge of the beyond

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:44.082
"And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow
Your heart dreams of spring

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.680
"Trust the dreams for in them
is hidden the gate to eternity

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.100
"For what is it to die but to stand naked

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.770
"In the wind and to melt into the sun?

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.247
"And what is it to cease breathing

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.723
"But to free the breath
from its restless tides

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:20.566
"That it may rise and expand
And seek God unencumbered?

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.404
"Only when you drink from
The river of silence shall you indeed sing

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.087
"And when you have reached The mountaintop

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.567
"Then you shall begin to climb

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.121
"And when the earth shall claim your limbs
Then shall you truly dance"

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.567
Almitra?

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.740
Yes.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.700
I'd like you to do something for me.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.820
Sure.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.400
Remember all those paintings in my house?

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.740
And all those papers I had written on?

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.366
You know, the ones the Sergeant
wouldn't let me take?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.380
I want you to have them.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.380
- Me?
- Yes.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.420
I want you to go gather them
before anyone else gets them.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.180
To make sure they're not destroyed. Okay?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.260
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.100
Good. Then later you can
share them with people.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.771
Remember when you and I flew on the wind?

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.367
My words are my wings.
And you are my messenger.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.530
So, go on. Go!

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.687
I'll keep them safe, Mustafa.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.406
Wait.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.128
You're gonna crush me.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.500
Are you all right, Mama?

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.969
Oh, yes, I'm very all right.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.220
The guards. Go, go, quick!

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.560
I'll handle them.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.340
Hey there, boys,

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.523
anybody want to see
some of my French postcards?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.641
I offer you one last chance
to renounce your teachings.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.460
I have only spoken to the people

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.086
of things they already
knew in their hearts.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.488
This would change nothing.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.140
Refuse to sign this,
and there will be nothing left of you.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.780
Not even your work.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.580
We'll burn it all.
Every last word and image.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.480
The people will remember them
long after I'm gone.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.810
To the poet's house.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.980
Look, Mama, I found another one!

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.445
Good, good.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.881
Huh!

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.726
Mustafa!

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.260
- Mustafa!
- Mustafa!

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.725
We'll miss you, brother!

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.766
Farewell, people of Orphalese!

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.442
"Patient is the captain of my ship

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.881
"And restless are the sails

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:29.369
"The mariners have heard the song
of the sea and will wait no longer"

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.685
I am ready.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.811
"Do not forget
that I will come back to you

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.140
"A little while,
and my longing shall gather

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.323
"Dust and foam for another body

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.780
"A little while

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.260
"A moment of rest upon the wind

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.567
"And another woman shall bear me

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.726
"Farewell to you
And the youth I have spent with you

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.644
"It was just yesterday we met in a dream

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:09.609
"But now sleep has fled
Our dream is over and we must part

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.400
"If in the twilight of memory
We should meet once more

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:30.161
"We will speak together again
And you shall sing me a deeper song"

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.130
Phew!

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.571
Look! There he is, Mama!

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.521
What? Who, Almitra?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.940
Where?

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.281
Mustafa! There!

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.340
I'm sorry, my little one, but he's...

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.205
No, look! On the ship!

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.286
See?

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.565
I do, Almitra.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.561
I do.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.926
"When you part from your friend
You grieve not

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.767
"For that which you love most in him
May be clearer in his absence

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.660
"And let there be no purpose in friendship

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.240
"Save the deepening of the spirit"
