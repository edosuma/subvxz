to bounce ideas off of.

That's not really my style.
What works for me, see, is the cocoa.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.400

is find a good topic like Bobby did...

09:47.992 --> 09:49.687

lt's Frank Gorshin's birthday.
He was The Riddler, you know.

12:33.657 --> 12:35.921
Next to the birthday column, Hank.

12:36.026 --> 12:38.654
Your musings are back. Good for you.

12:38.762 --> 12:41.663
-How'd you do it?
-l bought ad space.

12:41.932 --> 12:43.194
[Exclaims doubtfully]

12:43.300 --> 12:46.235
Damn right.
Let the readers get hooked again.

12:46.337 --> 12:49.397
That's when l pull the ad
and wait for the call.

12:52.209 --> 12:53.642

12:53.877 --> 12:54.844
[Exclaims quizzically]

[Exclaims smugly]

12:57.948 --> 12:59.142
[Students chattering]

13:01.885 --> 13:05.116
MRS. DONAVAN: So many people
like to knit.

13:05.389 --> 13:08.222
-l see you read my column.
-Twice.

13:08.325 --> 13:10.520
Well, thank you.

13:10.628 --> 13:13.461
Would you mind writing a letter
to the editor to that effect?

13:13.564 --> 13:17.398
lf l write one for you,
l'd have to write one for Clark Peters.

13:17.501 --> 13:20.334
lf you think it would.... l don't follow.

13:20.437 --> 13:22.871
lt seems both you and Clark Peters...

13:22.973 --> 13:25.965
believe that,
''When it comes to tea cozies...

13:26.076 --> 13:28.670
''it's either crochet or the highway.''

13:29.013 --> 13:31.641
That doesn't sound
like the Clark Peters l know.

13:31.749 --> 13:34.479
The Clark Peters l know
likes to burn things.

13:34.585 --> 13:37.611
Oh, my God. l feel so plagiarized.

13:37.721 --> 13:40.656
Plagiarism. That's a serious accusation...

13:40.758 --> 13:43.818
one you might have to level
at my entire seventh grade class...

13:43.927 --> 13:48.057
which has turned in papers
on ''Napkin Rings, Those Useful Things''...

13:48.165 --> 13:50.224
''Autumn: Love it or Leaf lt''...

13:50.334 --> 13:54.270
and my favorite,
''Did You Know Emily's Husband...

13:54.371 --> 13:57.169
''ls Having an Affair With Root Beer?''

13:57.274 --> 13:59.299
Don't worry, she's not jealous.

13:59.410 --> 14:03.039
Wait. Obviously, someone
has hacked into my Kaypro.

14:03.147 --> 14:04.671
l can believe that...

14:04.782 --> 14:08.081
or l can believe the nine children
who told me...

14:08.185 --> 14:10.176
Bobby wrote their essays.

14:10.287 --> 14:11.276
[Exclaims in surprise]

14:11.388 --> 14:13.481
Bobby Hill! Get over here!

14:14.625 --> 14:17.025
How dare you steal my musings?

14:17.528 --> 14:21.487
lt's your fault for writing my flag essay
and getting me an ''A.''

14:21.598 --> 14:24.658
Nobody bothered me
when l was a ''C'' student.

14:24.768 --> 14:25.735
Bobby!

14:25.869 --> 14:28.531
Now we're getting somewhere.

14:28.639 --> 14:32.735
lf l may steal something
from your musings, ''the sauce thickens.''

14:32.843 --> 14:37.075
What do you want? Money?
l spent it all on that ad.

14:37.181 --> 14:40.048
l think the right thing to do
would be to apologize.

14:40.150 --> 14:42.983
-Right. Bobby, tell her you're sorry.
-No, not to me...

14:43.087 --> 14:45.021
but to the entire student body.

14:45.122 --> 14:47.784
And what better place
than tomorrow's assembly?

14:47.891 --> 14:50.519
<i>l</i> suggest you each wr <i>i</i> te
your own apo <i>l</i> og <i>i</i> es,

14:50.627 --> 14:54.495
Otherwise, l will file a formal complaint
with Principal Moss.

14:54.598 --> 14:57.567
What did they teach you
in that graduate school?

14:57.668 --> 14:59.226
How to survive.

15:03.507 --> 15:04.474
[Bobby sighing]

15:04.608 --> 15:07.008
l guess deep down inside...

15:07.111 --> 15:10.376
part of me always knew
l didn't deserve that ''A.''

15:10.481 --> 15:12.949
God. When those students
see me on stage...

15:13.050 --> 15:15.109
they're gonna expect me
to receive another...

15:15.219 --> 15:17.187
''Substitute Teacher of the Year'' award.

15:17.287 --> 15:19.585
Not a self-administered tongue-lashing.

15:19.690 --> 15:23.626
l'm sorry, l cannot do it. l won't.
lt is not fair to the students.

15:23.727 --> 15:27.493
What you two did was wrong.
You've not only disgraced the flag...

15:27.598 --> 15:30.431
you've disgraced the republic
for which it stands.

15:30.534 --> 15:32.900
lf l were you,
l'd start writing your apologies.

15:33.003 --> 15:35.904
And if l were you,
l'd hide yours from Bobby.

15:37.074 --> 15:40.407
This is all my fault, Mom. l'm so sorry.

15:40.611 --> 15:42.101
l am sorry, too.

15:42.212 --> 15:44.942
But l will be damned
if l'm gonna get up on that stage...

15:45.048 --> 15:48.313
-and apologize to that woman.
-We have no choice.

15:48.418 --> 15:52.013
lf we don't go to the assembly,
Mrs. Donavan's gonna turn us in...

15:52.122 --> 15:53.783
to Principal Moss.

15:53.891 --> 15:56.860
Don't worry.
We are going to that assembly...

15:56.960 --> 15:59.485
and we are gonna put on
one hell of a show.

15:59.596 --> 16:02.429
-What do you mean?
-Those students don't need an apology...

16:02.533 --> 16:06.560
they need something to believe in.
And that's what we'll give them.

16:06.670 --> 16:09.935
Boy loves his country,
mother loves her son.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.508
lt's as American as apple pie.

16:12.609 --> 16:15.976
And if Donavan says ''Boo,''
they'll hang her for treason.

16:16.079 --> 16:19.242
Yeah! l love apple pie!

16:19.616 --> 16:23.848
PEGGY: That flag got us into this mess,
and that flag is gonna get us out.

16:23.954 --> 16:26.855
PEGGY: At tomorrow's assembly,
we will give those saps...

16:26.957 --> 16:30.415

snow job.

while l distract him. Go.

16:41.738 --> 16:44.866
Honey, is the grout cracking
around the tub?

16:44.975 --> 16:46.033
What?

16:48.645 --> 16:49.703
HANK: Good Lord.

16:50.547 --> 16:53.846

Mr. Dauterive keeps that flag...

All right. Change in plan.

17:05.929 --> 17:08.727
l've taken down laundry,
l can take down a flag.

17:08.832 --> 17:10.823
And l can drive a truck.

17:10.968 --> 17:11.992
Yeah.

17:17.207 --> 17:20.199
Okay, little more. Keep coming.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.972
Little more. Okay, you're fine. All right.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.048
Now, let's fold as we go.

17:25.415 --> 17:29.442
And, remember, we are stealing this flag,
we are not disgracing it.

17:29.553 --> 17:30.679
Ready?

PEGGY: Bobby, honey,
do not look over. Wait.

17:46.136 --> 17:49.503
No, that makes you look guilty. Look over.

[Mysterious instrumental music]

17:58.248 --> 17:59.306
Perfect.

18:04.021 --> 18:07.218
The flag! Quick, get back in that truck.

Please, let it be a speed bump.
Come on, speed bump.

18:20.304 --> 18:23.273
PEGGY: Speed bump, right?
BOBBY: No, it's the flag.

18:23.774 --> 18:26.140
And it's wrapped around the axle.

All right. Slowly drive forward.

l'll pull a rope...

18:39.089 --> 18:41.751

they will not know what hit them.

has become old, ripped, wet...
