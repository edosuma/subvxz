WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.469
Previously on Hannibal.

00:02.500 --> 00:04.661
- Four of the lures are made
from materials Including

00:04.700 --> 00:07.168
human remains.
- Kade Purnell,

00:07.200 --> 00:09.509
Office of the Inspector General,
FBI Oversight.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.235
- I'm pleading innocent.

00:11.270 --> 00:14.398
- You'll be found guilty and
given the federal death penalty.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.442
- What defense
do you think I have?

00:16.480 --> 00:19.040
- You had no _control of what
you were domg, much less

00:19.080 --> 00:21.344
remember doing it.
(coughing)

00:21.380 --> 00:24.144
- Betrayal was
the only thing that felt

00:24.190 --> 00:27.079
real to me.
I trusted you.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.578
- Let me help you.
- I need your help.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.428
- (Jack): We investigated
your claims about Dr. Lecter.

00:33.460 --> 00:37.328
We found nothing. You stood
over Cassie Boyle's body
in that field and

00:37.370 --> 00:41.158
you described yourself to me.
- (Will): No, I described
Hannibal Lecter.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.169
- (Beverly): You
think Will is innocent.
- I don't know what I think.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.236
- I think he still wants to save
lives. That's what I think.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.105
(electricity buzzing)

01:43.300 --> 01:45.518
(electricity buzzing)

01:57.680 --> 01:59.648
- (man): Mr. Graham, it's time.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.808
(breathing quickly)

02:10.630 --> 02:13.258
(opera music)

02:18.900 --> 02:22.438
(opera music)

02:50.400 --> 02:54.439
- Let me tell you the story of
a mild-mannered FBI instructor

02:54.470 --> 02:57.837
who was asked to create
a psychological profile
of a murderer -

02:57.870 --> 03:02.273
Garret Jacob Hobbs,
the Minnesota Shrike.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.744
He killed young women
that looked

03:04.780 --> 03:07.544
just like his daughter.
He killed them

03:07.580 --> 03:10.242
and he ate them.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.249
Will Graham understood
the way Hobbs thought.
That's how he caught him.

03:14.290 --> 03:17.953
He shot Hobbs dead while he cut
his daughter's throat.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.254
So, Will Graham was able
to save Abigail

03:20.300 --> 03:22.325
Hobbs' life. But

03:22.370 --> 03:24.361
the profile
that he created

03:24.400 --> 03:29.269
of her father was so vivid
that he couldn't escape it.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.460
- See.

03:31.510 --> 03:32.875
See.

03:32.910 --> 03:37.347
- And in an unconscious state...
he killed

03:37.380 --> 03:39.575
four more women.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.919
Cassie Boyle.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.581
Marissa Schuur.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.520
Georgia Madchen.

03:52.530 --> 03:53.827
Abigail Hobbs.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.829
He was able to save
Abigail Hobbs

03:56.870 --> 04:00.397
from her father, but he wasn't
able to save her from himself.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.260
He killed her

04:02.310 --> 04:04.266
and he ate her.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.802
At the very least,
he ate her ear. What happened

04:07.840 --> 04:11.048
to the rest of Abigail Hobbs
is locked away

04:11.080 --> 04:14.311
in the recesses of Will Graham's
traumatized mind,

04:14.350 --> 04:16.386
or so he would
have you believe.

04:16.420 --> 04:20.982
Something else you should know
about Will Graham: he has

04:21.020 --> 04:23.853
remarkable visual memory;

04:23.890 --> 04:27.826
he's keenly insightful
to the human condition; and...

04:27.860 --> 04:30.420
I would argue,
the smartest person

04:30.470 --> 04:32.335
in this room.

04:32.370 --> 04:34.338
He's capable

04:34.370 --> 04:36.861
of creating
a psychological profile

04:36.910 --> 04:40.277
of a completely different kind
of murderer.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.742
One that would
become his alibi.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.622
- Moment of truth.

05:00.660 --> 05:03.060
- If I only knew
what the truth was.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.660
- There's nothing wrong
with your instincts.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.066
- My instincts have not yet
arrived at conviction.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.332
- Mine have, with the benefit
of no previous involvement

05:12.380 --> 05:14.803
and no personal connections
to the accused.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.809
- Meaning I can't be impartial?
- Of course you can
be impartial,

05:17.850 --> 05:21.069
but right now you're not.
You have to believe something,

05:21.120 --> 05:25.409
as long as there is reason
and evidence to believe.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.850
You've got reason;
you've got evidence.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.859
Wi||_ Graham is
playing a game.

05:30.890 --> 05:34.348
I understand why that might be
hard for you to accept.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.789
- Do you?

05:36.830 --> 05:39.731
- It's easier to be a man who
missed his friend's suffering

05:39.770 --> 05:41.897
than it is to be the head
of Behavioral Sciences

05:41.940 --> 05:45.637
at the FBI who missed a killer
standing right in front of him.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.729
There's a reason

05:47.780 --> 05:51.375
that you're a witness for
the prosecution, Agent Crawford.

05:51.410 --> 05:53.514
- Remind me
what that reason is.

05:53.550 --> 05:56.439
- If you can't represent
your own beliefs,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.788
represent the Bureau's.
(door opening)

05:58.820 --> 06:01.618
- (woman): Agent Crawford?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.799
Let yourself
off the hook, Jack.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.096
- How did you meet Will Graham?
- I met him at the opening
of the Evil Minds

06:13.140 --> 06:16.064
Research Museum. He didn't agree
with what we called it.

06:16.100 --> 06:20.002
He told me that the title
mythologlzed banal and cruel men

06:20.040 --> 06:23.009
who didn't deserve to be
thought of as super-villains.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.474
- And what was
your first Impressmn?
- He was intelligent.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.873
And arrogant.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.048
And very likely
on the spectrum.

06:31.090 --> 06:35.550
- Which is why he wasn't
real FBI. He didn't pass

06:35.590 --> 06:38.889
the screening procedures.
- Yes.

06:38.930 --> 06:42.195
- But you felt that he was
qualified to work in the field.
- Under my supervision.

06:42.230 --> 06:45.620
- And you believed that he was
valuable because he could
think like a killer?

06:45.670 --> 06:48.935
- He could think like anybody.
- Sounds like a super-villain.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.106
Five horrendous murders,
over 40 different

06:54.140 --> 06:56.449
pieces of forensic
and physical evidence

06:56.480 --> 06:59.608
that tell us that Will Graham
can think like_a killer
because he IS one.

06:59.650 --> 07:02.813
Rather than feel tormented
by the work he did,

07:02.850 --> 07:07.651
Will Graham enjoyed the cover
his role at the FBI gave him

07:07.690 --> 07:12.184
to commit his terrible crimes.
- I don't believe that
to be true.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.821
- Agent Crawford?

07:18.870 --> 07:21.930
- Will hated every second
of the work. He hated it.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.165
He didn't fake that.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.633
He hated it
and I kept making him do it.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.843
- Why then is it that when you
offered him an opportunity
to quit, he refused?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.178
- (firmly): Because he was
saving lives.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.916
I had been warned
by more than one person

07:37.950 --> 07:40.817
that ifI pushed Will,
I'd break him.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.152
I put those checks and balances
in place, then ignored them.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.961
And here we are.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.558
- What does
Jack Crawford drink?

08:16.590 --> 08:19.821
Whatever it is, I need to send
him a very expensive bottle.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.192
- He said I'm a killer
because he drove me Insane.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.198
- No, he paved the road
for your defense.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.198
- Well, he didn't say
I'm innocent.

08:26.230 --> 08:29.836
- Innocence isn't a verdict,
Mr. Graham, but "not guilty" is.

08:29.870 --> 08:32.600
This isn't law;
it's advertising.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.131
- Advertising trivializes;

08:35.180 --> 08:37.944
it, uh, manipulates;
it's vulgar.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.016
- Boo-hoo.
So is the law.

08:40.050 --> 08:43.645
We have to create desire
to find you "not gthy,"

08:43.690 --> 08:46.284
_ which is nonexistent
In this courtroom right now.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.289
We're manipulating people
into buying something
they don't need.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.118
- Mr. Brauer?
- They don't want
your innocence. Thank you.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.151
_ Unconsciousness
in a pretty package,

08:54.200 --> 08:56.191
that I can sell.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.988
If I take the moral high ground
with you, I'll get you killed.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.782
I think I opened
your mail.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.853
***

09:42.380 --> 09:45.577
_*** _
(cla55ical piano)

09:57.790 --> 10:00.156
- That was a good and brave
thing you did for Will today.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.225
- It may have
cost me my job.

10:02.260 --> 10:04.797
- The prospect doesn't seem

10:04.830 --> 10:07.060
to trouble you as much
as I would have thought.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.679
- Hav_en't felt better
in weeks.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.678
(glasses touched)
- Clarity will do that.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.842
- Mm.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.145
- Tell me, Jack.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.079
Was your testimony meant
to be a resignation?

10:27.120 --> 10:30.123
- There is
something appealing

10:30.160 --> 10:32.355
about walking away
from all of the noise.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.328
I'm...

10:38.370 --> 10:41.828
content to let
the chips fall.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.276
- The magic door is
always attractive -

10:47.310 --> 10:49.744
step through and leave
all your burdens behind.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.447
- I've given my life...
to death.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.254
- And now death has
followed you home...

11:02.260 --> 11:04.888
...come to live
in your house.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.057
(taking a breath)

11:09.970 --> 11:13.462
- Bella has kept our bedroom
from looking too much
like a sickroom.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.037
There are flowers,
but not too many.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.901
You know.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.079
She insists that _there are
no pills in Sight.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.277
So, I've been thinking about
taking her to Italy
where we met.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.872
We could...

11:33.960 --> 11:35.689
She could die there.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.359
- Jack.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.928
You're not sick.

11:45.970 --> 11:49.098
You don't have to go
into the ground with her.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.103
When Bella's lost to you,
the FBI could still be there.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.787
- You're telling me not
to commit professional suicide?

12:05.450 --> 12:09.409
- As a friend, I'm telling you
not to force an issue

12:09.460 --> 12:13.749
for the short-term emotional
satisfaction it can have.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.034
(inaudible)

12:31.850 --> 12:34.273
- ...shrunken capillaries.
The ear was cut from a corpse

12:34.320 --> 12:35.947
no more than 48 hours ago.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.346
- Before the trial started.
- We fumed it all -

12:38.390 --> 12:41.188
ear's clean, no prints
on either of the envelopes,

12:41.220 --> 12:43.222
besides the courier,
paralegal, and lavwer.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.785
- We know
Will Graham didn't do it.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.196
- It wouldn't surprise me.
- The timing's deliberate.

12:48.230 --> 12:52.166
It was choreographed to drop
the ear at the beginning
of Will's trial.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.966
- Such a gift has
great significance.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.308
- A gift from who?
- Will claimed

12:59.340 --> 13:03.242
someone else committed
the crimes he's accused of.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.374
- He said
that person was you.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.140
- Perhaps he was
half right.

13:13.090 --> 13:16.116
- Oh, you've gotta be
kidding me.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.153
- It seems _
you have an admirer.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.067
- You think someone sent me
an ear because they admire me?

13:25.100 --> 13:27.466
- The boundaries
of what's considered normal

13:27.500 --> 13:30.936
are getting narrower.
Outside those boundaries,

13:30.970 --> 13:33.336
this may be intended
as a helpful gesture.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.941
- How far would you go
to help me?

13:36.980 --> 13:39.847
- It hadn't occurred to me
to send you an ear.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.846
But I'm grateful
someone has.

13:44.890 --> 13:49.554
- Gratitude has
a short half-life.

13:49.590 --> 13:52.354
- So can doubt.

13:52.390 --> 13:54.858
I have new thoughts
about who you are.

13:57.130 --> 13:59.394
There may very well be
another killer.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.607
- (softly): I want there to be.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.574
- Some part of you
still suspects me.

14:10.610 --> 14:13.010
- I don't know
what anyone is

14:13.050 --> 14:15.439
capable of anymore,
least of all myself.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.345
But, um...

14:19.960 --> 14:23.088
..._I know there is
no eVIdence against you.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.927
- There never was.

14:26.930 --> 14:29.490
- And accusing you
makes me look insane.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.339
I'm not insane.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.102
Not anymore.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.603
- And you may not
be guilty.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.211
This ear you were sent

14:54.260 --> 14:57.479
is an opportunity.

14:57.530 --> 15:01.250
If someone else is responsible
for your crimes,

15:01.300 --> 15:03.268
perhaps he now wants
to be seen.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.031
- Why would he want
to be seen now?

15:07.070 --> 15:09.959
- He cares
what happens to you.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.144
- The prosecution calls
Freddie Lounds to the stand.

15:33.530 --> 15:37.091
- I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing
but the truth.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.198
- Could you please describe

15:45.240 --> 15:47.504
your relationship
with Abigail

15:47.540 --> 15:50.441
Hobbs?
- We were very close.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.268
I was helping her write a book
about surviving her father.
- Did you ever discuss

15:54.320 --> 15:58.279
Will Graham with Abigail?
- Abigail told me

15:58.320 --> 16:02.359
she believed Will Graham wanted
to kill her and cannibalize her

16:02.390 --> 16:04.426
like her father
wanted to do.

16:04.460 --> 16:07.156
She was right.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.323
I should've
listened to her.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.634
- Do you blame yourself
for her death?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.631
- I blame Will Graham.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.038
- Thank you.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.479
Your witness.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.082
- Miss Lounds.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.285
Could you please...

16:38.330 --> 16:43.097
remind me how many times
you've been sued for libel?

16:45.770 --> 16:47.328
- (quietly): Six.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.031
- Sorry?

16:50.840 --> 16:53.172
- Six.
- Six.

16:53.210 --> 16:57.374
And how many times
did you settle?

16:57.410 --> 16:59.799
- Six.

16:59.850 --> 17:01.818
- Six.

17:01.850 --> 17:05.081
Thank you.
Nothing further.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.650
- The defense calls
Dr. Alana Bloom.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.749
- I believe Will's
empathy disorder...

17:13.760 --> 17:16.627
...combined with the effects
of viral encephalitis...

17:19.230 --> 17:21.767
Do we have to do this
like this?

17:21.800 --> 17:26.703
- I don't want the first time
you do this to be in court.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.334
Dr. Bloom, weren't

17:29.380 --> 17:31.644
you and the accused
romantically involved?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.739
- How is this relevant
to the case?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.452
- It's relevant
to your testimony.

17:40.490 --> 17:43.220
In that court, your feelings,
your emotions,

17:43.260 --> 17:46.184
your pro-everything-Will-Graham
will be on trial.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.255
You get all starey
and non-blinlq like that,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.495
it'll undermine you and me,
but mainly him.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.498
- My testimony is based
on my professional--

17:52.530 --> 17:55.328
- You are smitten
with the accused, Miss Bloom,

17:55.370 --> 17:57.463
And it is adorable,
but not our brand of defense.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.728
And Ms. Vega will
smell it on you

17:59.770 --> 18:03.206
like you stepped
in Young Adult and
tracked it into the courtroom.

18:03.250 --> 18:07.846
Were you and Will Graham
involved romantically?

18:15.390 --> 18:17.620
- I have no romantic feelings
for Will Graham.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.128
I_ have _ _
a professmnal curi05ity.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.865
- I like that.
"Professional curiosity."

18:25.900 --> 18:27.629
It seems so...

18:27.670 --> 18:30.400
heh, it seems so indifferent.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.273
Unless you look like you're
lying when you say it.

18:33.310 --> 18:34.834
But you didn't.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.859
- (Jack): You've
identified the ear?
- (Brian): We identified

18:52.890 --> 18:55.597
the knife that cut it off.
- It's Will Graham's.

18:55.630 --> 18:58.565
The blade matches the cuts
on Abigail Hobbs's ear
and on this one.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.364
- It was presented in court
as evidence, then it was sent

19:01.400 --> 19:03.561
to the courthouse evidence room
where it was checked out

19:03.610 --> 19:05.760
by the bailiff in Will's trial,
Andrew Sykes,

19:05.810 --> 19:10.247
and it never went back.
- Pretty good, right?

19:24.260 --> 19:25.659
- (quietly): Go.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.841
(siren)

20:33.730 --> 20:35.698
They wanted to give us
a warm welcome

20:35.730 --> 20:37.869
and make sure
that we found something.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.596
- An arresting piece
of theater.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.507
- Our bailiff was mounted
on a stag's head.

20:43.540 --> 20:47.499
Glasgow smile. Killer lopped off
his ear and set him on fire.

20:47.540 --> 20:48.973
Will Graham's greatest hits.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.574
- Could we have been that wrong?
- About Will Graham? No.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.918
We could not. He practically
takes selfies with his victims.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.918
- The evidence we found was
immediate and almost

20:57.950 --> 20:59.986
presentational. May as well
have been gift-wrapped.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.409
- That's what Will said
about Cassie Boyle

21:02.460 --> 21:05.486
when we found her in that field.
"Field kabuki."

21:05.530 --> 21:08.499
- There was no evidence before
Will was apprehended and there
hasn't been any since.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.327
- He ate a girl's ear!

21:10.370 --> 21:12.759
It was in his stomach. God knows
what else of her was in there.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.836
- We should've taken
a stool sample.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.361
- Yes! We should have.
- Well, why didn't we?

21:17.410 --> 21:21.631
I was the one that said
we should have.
- Knock it off.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.046
- What impact could
this have on Will's trial?

21:29.620 --> 21:31.838
- This murder raises
serious doubts about

21:31.890 --> 21:35.678
the case against Will Graham.
- Your team provided
the evidence.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.689
- The overwhelming evidence.
- So you understand
the significance

21:38.730 --> 21:40.994
of my questioning it.
- Agent Crawford,

21:41.030 --> 21:44.693
we all heard your testimony.
Are you sure you're not
just trying to assuage

21:44.730 --> 21:47.028
your own guilt?
- Yes, I'm sure.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.834
- I'm not. _
- Andrew Sykes was mutilated

21:49.870 --> 21:52.532
in the exact same manner
Will Graham allegedly

21:52.570 --> 21:54.674
mutilated his victims -
ways that have not been

21:54.710 --> 21:58.009
made public.
- Will Graham isn't saying
he didn't kill those people.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.814
His lawyer is running
an unconsciousness defense.

22:00.850 --> 22:04.445
In effect, he's admitting
the acts, but just not
the responsibility.

22:04.490 --> 22:08.051
_ -_Wi||'s maintained
his innocence all along,
in spite of memory gaps.

22:08.090 --> 22:11.924
Whatever Mr. Brauer's strategy
is, this will offer a new
line of defense.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.520
- That's for Mr. Brauer to tell
me, Agent Crawford, not you.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.069
- Yes, Your Honor.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.435
- (Chilton): Will Graham
manifests publicly

22:28.480 --> 22:31.108
as an introverted personality.
He would like us to believe

22:31.150 --> 22:33.471
he places on the spectrum
somewhere

22:33.520 --> 22:35.408
near Asperger's
and autism.

22:35.450 --> 22:38.840
Yet he also claims
an empathy disorder.

22:38.890 --> 22:43.008
- You choose your words
very carefully, Dr. Chilton.

22:43.060 --> 22:45.028
You chose the word

22:45.060 --> 22:48.552
"claims."
- Will Graham has
never been diagnosed.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.693
He will not allow anyone
to test him.

22:50.730 --> 22:52.698
He has carefully
constructed

22:52.730 --> 22:55.528
a persona to hide
his real nature from the world.

22:55.570 --> 22:57.401
He wears it so well

22:57.440 --> 22:59.533
even Jack Crawford could
not see past it.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.777
- (Vega): But you did?

23:01.810 --> 23:04.938
- Mr. Graham and I had
no personal relationship

23:04.980 --> 23:09.076
for him to manipulate.
I have objectively examined him

23:09.120 --> 23:11.088
and the crimes
of which he is

23:11.120 --> 23:13.486
accused.
These murders

23:13.520 --> 23:16.956
were measured
and controlled.

23:16.990 --> 23:19.686
The confused man Will Graham
presents to the world

23:19.730 --> 23:22.551
could not _commit
those crimes,

23:22.600 --> 23:24.818
because that man is
a fiction.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.868
- So,

23:28.900 --> 23:31.630
you discount the encephalitis
he was suffering as a cause?

23:31.670 --> 23:35.208
- He managed his illness with
the help of his neurologist,

23:35.240 --> 23:37.447
whom he murdered
for his trouble.

23:40.110 --> 23:42.647
- Is Will Graham
an intelligent psychopath?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.989
- There is not yet a name

23:45.020 --> 23:46.942
for whatever Will Graham is.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.811
He kills methodically,

23:49.860 --> 23:53.921
and I believe would kill again,
given the opportunity.

23:56.630 --> 23:58.598
- Thank you,
Dr. Chilton.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.632
Your witness.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.599
- Dr. Chilton,

24:08.640 --> 24:11.700
Will Graham spent his time
catching murderers for the FBI.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.775
You don't see a contradiction
between that

24:13.820 --> 24:15.845
and your description
of a coldblooded killer?

24:15.880 --> 24:17.711
- No, I do not.

24:17.750 --> 24:21.618
Will Graham is driven by vanity
and his own whims.

24:21.660 --> 24:24.720
He has a very high opinion
of his intelligence.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.251
Ergo, he caught
the other killers

24:27.290 --> 24:29.121
simply to prove

24:29.160 --> 24:31.765
he was smarter
than all of them too.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.862
Saving lives is just as arousing
as ending them.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.901
He likes to play God.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.081
(keypad beeping)

24:57.120 --> 25:00.248
(door buzzer)

25:35.600 --> 25:37.864
- My admirer?
- Yes.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.704
The forensic report
from the crime scene.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.129
What do you see?

26:19.940 --> 26:23.649
(soft ambient pulse)

26:29.780 --> 26:32.783
(steady heartbeat)

26:47.170 --> 26:50.628
(door opening and closing)

26:57.080 --> 26:59.708
- I shoot Mr. Sykes once,

26:59.750 --> 27:01.377
collapsing lungs,

27:01.420 --> 27:05.208
tearing through his heart's
aorta and pulmonary arteries.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.684
(silenced gunshot)

27:11.090 --> 27:14.093
_ _ He will die _
believmg we were friends.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.863
It is his last thought.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.761
(Will panting)

27:30.440 --> 27:32.647
His death isn't personal.

27:44.730 --> 27:49.258
He is merely the ink
from which flows my poem.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.279
My tribute.

28:08.250 --> 28:09.979
This is my design.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.912
It's not the same killer.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.719
He murdered his victim first,
and then mutilated him.

28:23.030 --> 28:26.466
Cassie Boyle's lungs were
removed when _she was
still breathing.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.264
Georgia Madchen was burned
alive. What I...

28:29.300 --> 28:31.063
what... what I found

28:31.110 --> 28:34.409
of Abigail was cut off
while her heart was beating.

28:36.880 --> 28:40.839
- Then this...
is blunt reproduction?

28:40.880 --> 28:42.916
- You knew that already.

28:45.050 --> 28:47.018
- Would've liked
to have been wrong.

28:47.050 --> 28:49.280
- Occam's broom.

28:51.290 --> 28:54.350
You intentionally ignored facts
that refute your argument

28:54.400 --> 28:57.426
hoping nobody'd notice.
- You noticed.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.826
- Mm-hmm.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.131
- I wanted to dispel your doubts
once and for all.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.309
- My doubts about what?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.818
- Me.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.517
I want you to believe
in the best of me,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.051
just as I believe
in the best of you.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.928
This crime offered us both
reasonable doubt.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.167
- It offered us
a distraction.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.968
- Maybe this acolyte is giving
you your path to freedom.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.002
Even Jack is ready
to believe, Will.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.979
- It would be a lie.

29:56.390 --> 29:58.950
- I don't want you to be here.
- I don't want me to be here

29:58.990 --> 30:01.049
either.
- Then you have a choice.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.489
This killer wrote you
a poem.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.359
Are you going to let his love
go to waste?

30:21.220 --> 30:22.915
- I'm confused.

30:22.950 --> 30:26.408
You're going to abandon
your defense strategy,

30:26.450 --> 30:29.886
the entire case _
you've bUIlt, mid-trial.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.150
- Exciting,
isn't it?

30:32.190 --> 30:34.420
- And this seems reasonable
to you?

30:34.460 --> 30:36.894
- It's not only
reasonable;

30:36.930 --> 30:38.898
it's fashionable.

30:38.930 --> 30:41.091
There's a killer
on the loose,

30:41.140 --> 30:43.199
demonstrating all the hallmarks
of Will Graham's

30:43.240 --> 30:45.902
alleged murders.
- Do you think this killer

30:45.940 --> 30:48.909
committed the crimes
that you're accused of?
- Don't answer that,

30:48.940 --> 30:50.976
not_ in front of me.
It's inconsequential.

30:51.010 --> 30:54.116
- But is it true?
- You're being awfully
high and mighty, Dr. Bloom.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.118
Very ivory tower,
very reductive.

30:56.150 --> 31:00.314
Very far from the point,
which is the exoneration
of your friend

31:00.350 --> 31:02.386
Will Graham.
- And the point you're trying

31:02.420 --> 31:04.559
to make is reasonable doubt.
- That's a Win, yes.

31:04.590 --> 31:07.559
- The best you can
hope for is mistrial.
- That's also a win.

31:07.590 --> 31:10.195
- You won't be able to plead
unconsciousness again.

31:10.230 --> 31:12.460
- Your fast,
triumphant diagnosis

31:12.500 --> 31:14.559
of unconsciousness was
the best play we had.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.433
Now we have a better play.
Needless to say,

31:17.470 --> 31:20.109
I won't be calling you
to the witness stand.

31:20.140 --> 31:23.200
- Who's taking the stand
in my place?

31:44.200 --> 31:46.623
- I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

31:46.670 --> 31:49.468
and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

31:57.310 --> 31:59.699
- Good morning, Doctor.

31:59.750 --> 32:03.538
Please describe
your relationship
with Will Graham.

32:03.580 --> 32:06.344
- I was asked by Jack Crawford
to monitor Will's

32:06.390 --> 32:09.052
emotional well-being
while he worked on cases.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.354
I was never officially
his psychiatrist.

32:11.390 --> 32:13.426
- If you weren't his
psychiatrist, what were you?

32:13.460 --> 32:15.451
- I was meant
to be his stability.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.998
I failed him in that.
- How did you fail him?

32:24.040 --> 32:26.668
- I was unable to determine
if Will's condition was due

32:26.710 --> 32:30.271
to mental illness or stress
from his work at the FBI.

32:32.350 --> 32:35.342
My mistake was
never considering his innocence

32:35.380 --> 32:39.612
until the murder of a bailiff
from this courthouse.

32:39.650 --> 32:42.585
- And how did you know
about that, Dr. Lecter?

32:42.620 --> 32:46.056
- I have been asked to consult
on the case by Jack Crawford.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.059
He wanted a profile
of the bailiff's killer.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.193
- So, you believe

32:51.230 --> 32:53.596
the bailiff's murder was
committed by the same person

32:53.630 --> 32:56.360
guilty of Will Graham's
alleged crimes, yes?

32:56.400 --> 32:59.528
- Profiles aren't evidence;
they're opinion.
This is hearsay.

32:59.570 --> 33:02.073
- I will allow it.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.079
- Thank you,
Your Honor.

33:05.110 --> 33:08.568
- I believe there are alarming
similarities in the crimes, yes.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.576
- Will Graham accused you

33:10.620 --> 33:13.248
of the crimes for which
he now stands trial, and yet

33:13.290 --> 33:16.282
here you are, testifying

33:16.320 --> 33:19.027
on his behalf
for the defense.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.518
- Will rightfully couldn't
accept these actions to be his.

33:24.530 --> 33:28.159
A mind faced
with the possibility
of committing such deeds

33:28.200 --> 33:30.634
will find an alternative reality
to believe in.

33:30.670 --> 33:33.434
- You don't blame him
for that?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.438
- No.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.040
Will Graham is

33:38.080 --> 33:40.571
and will always be
my friend.

33:40.610 --> 33:43.170
- Your witness.

33:43.220 --> 33:47.111
- Dr. Lecter,
what was the cause

33:47.150 --> 33:49.459
of death
in the bailiff's murder?

33:49.490 --> 33:52.459
- A bullet to the heart.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.697
- Mm. And in Will Graham's

33:54.730 --> 33:57.119
victims, or alleged victims,
what was

33:57.160 --> 34:00.061
their cause of death?

34:00.100 --> 34:02.068
- Mutilation.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.807
- That's very different
from a bullet.

34:04.840 --> 34:08.435
- No two crimes of any killer
are going to be exactly
the same.

34:08.480 --> 34:13.144
The similarities--
- Your Honor, the witness's
personal beliefs and biases

34:13.180 --> 34:15.546
are driving his conclusions.
There are clearly

34:15.580 --> 34:17.673
two different killers
and two different cases.

34:17.720 --> 34:21.383
- Your Honor, there are
sufficient similarities
to con5ider this a defense.

34:23.660 --> 34:26.720
- I'm ruling this defense
inadmissible, Mr. Brauer.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.729
- Thank you, Your Honor.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.218
- (judge): All previous
testimony on the matter will
be stricken from the record.

34:38.470 --> 34:41.473
_*** _
(cla55ical piano)

36:14.400 --> 36:17.335
- (Jack): So, it appears that
the judge was murdered
in his chambers,

36:17.370 --> 36:20.737
and then he was hauled out here
to be put on display.

36:20.770 --> 36:24.649
- Not only is justice blind;
it's mindless and heartless.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.898
How did the killer get
so close?

36:26.950 --> 36:29.919
- No sign of a struggle.
Mutilation was post-mortem.

36:29.950 --> 36:32.544
- He was shot in the chest
just like the bailiff.

36:32.590 --> 36:35.559
Can't see the, uh, entry wound
because he removed the heart.

36:35.590 --> 36:39.378
- But there is an exit wound.
No slug - must have
taken it with him.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.591
- A trophy.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.291
- Doctor.

36:46.300 --> 36:49.360
With this judge's death,
there will be no verdict.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.630
No ending.
It'll start again,

36:51.670 --> 36:53.900
like the trial
never happened.

36:53.940 --> 36:56.374
But why?

36:56.410 --> 37:00.244
- Psychopathic violence is
predominantly goal-oriented,

37:00.280 --> 37:02.919
a means to a very
particular end.

37:02.950 --> 37:06.511
- So, the killer wanted
a mistrial?

37:06.550 --> 37:10.509
- It's an elegant,
if rather unorthodox, solution.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.654
- He spares Will a guilty
verdict and his life
for the moment.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.250
- Yes.
- The question is,

37:16.300 --> 37:18.495
is it the same killer?

37:18.530 --> 37:20.691
Is Will still on trial,
in your mind?

37:20.730 --> 37:22.698
- The use of a gun;

37:22.740 --> 37:25.368
death first,
mutilation last.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.999
I feel like St. Peter ready
to deny Will for the third time.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.645
I'm not sure this is
the same killer, Jack.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.409
- Excuse me.

37:45.860 --> 37:49.352
The killer exerted careful
control of the environment.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.494
He left very little
evidence behind.

37:52.530 --> 37:54.361
- Jeez, Jack.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.766
The trial was supposed
to put an end to this.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.303
Instead, the circus has
just added another ring.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.434
- And we're the clowns.
- Who's "we,"

38:02.480 --> 38:04.903
Jack?

38:04.950 --> 38:07.043
- I got off track.

38:07.080 --> 38:11.312
- You have to force yourself
out of this train of thought.

38:11.350 --> 38:13.318
The trial was going wrong

38:13.350 --> 38:15.955
before this murder.
The trial was going wrong

38:15.990 --> 38:18.720
because you wanted
to believe Will Graham.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.888
Who is he to you that makes you
want to risk everything for him?

38:21.930 --> 38:25.991
- A very cogent reminder
of the pitfalls of having faith
in one's fellow man, thank you.

38:26.030 --> 38:30.763
- Everyone at one point
or another has to_ leave
somebody behind.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.768
You've got
to cut him loose.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.778
Otherwise, the someone
being left behind,

38:34.810 --> 38:37.608
today or tomorrow...

38:37.640 --> 38:39.471
is gonna be you.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.537
(door buzzer)

39:06.570 --> 39:08.731
(door opening)

39:08.780 --> 39:10.771
(footsteps)

39:29.560 --> 39:31.767
(footsteps)

39:44.450 --> 39:46.645
(footsteps)

40:04.200 --> 40:06.020
- (Hannibal): Will.

40:16.580 --> 40:21.745
- I was hoping the verdict would
have helped focus your mind
to get better;

40:21.780 --> 40:26.114
make what happened to you
less terrifying and confusing.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.556
I can't exactly blame
your lawyer.

40:31.590 --> 40:34.081
- Faith in any sort
of legal justice has never been

40:34.130 --> 40:36.155
any more comforting
than a nightlight.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.699
- There are so many
miscarriages of justice

40:41.740 --> 40:45.699
when it comes to
identifying a psychopath.

40:45.740 --> 40:48.163
You could easily have been
misdiagnosed.

40:48.210 --> 40:52.044
- I've already been
misdiagnosed.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.514
- Not by the court.

40:54.550 --> 40:58.008
- No. Not yet.

41:03.560 --> 41:07.519
I walked out of that courtroom,
and I could hear my blood,

41:07.560 --> 41:09.118
like, uh...

41:11.130 --> 41:13.769
...a hollow drumming
of wings.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.894
And I had the...

41:16.940 --> 41:19.204
absurd feeling

41:19.240 --> 41:21.834
that whoever
this killer is...

41:24.580 --> 41:27.105
...he walked out
of that courtroom with me.

41:32.850 --> 41:35.648
He's gonna reach out to me.

41:37.660 --> 41:39.582
- What does he want?

41:45.870 --> 41:47.861
- He wants to know me.

41:55.210 --> 41:57.201
What do you want?

42:02.150 --> 42:04.141
- I want to save you.
