WEBVTT

00:17.417 --> 00:18.792
HANNAH: I'm in school for thing
I actually want to do,

00:18.792 --> 00:20.166
so shouldn't I
actually want to do it?

00:20.166 --> 00:21.041
No.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.000
We are Desi and Marnie.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.667
I was just threatened
by the musical connection

00:26.667 --> 00:28.250
- you guys share.
-(MOANS)

00:28.250 --> 00:29.834
Even if you were
to jettison her,

00:29.834 --> 00:32.000
anyone who would treat
you this way is selfish.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.500
Are you going to work now?

00:34.500 --> 00:35.917
Like everyone else
except for me.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.458
Clearly, you do not
want this job.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.834
Maybe you would still like
to go for a drink sometime.

00:40.834 --> 00:41.834
Yeah, absolutely.

00:42.291 --> 00:43.458
What have you heard
from Adam?

00:43.458 --> 00:44.834
You talk to him?

00:44.834 --> 00:45.959
JESSA: No, not really.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.166
Iowa is not for everybody.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.792
You just have to do
what's right for you.

00:52.291 --> 00:53.542
Are you Hannah?

00:53.542 --> 00:54.834
is this your roommate?

00:54.834 --> 00:55.625
No.

00:56.208 --> 00:58.583
Hannah, we are going
to get through this together.

00:58.583 --> 00:59.792
You're the new sub, right?

00:59.792 --> 01:01.417
I am, it's my first week.

01:01.417 --> 01:02.792
Should we get some drinks
tonight or what?

01:03.333 --> 01:05.500
I told Clementine about us.
I broke up with her.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.792
Will you marry me?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.250
-We're getting married!
-(APPLAUSE)

01:09.250 --> 01:11.250
It's great news.
I'm so happy for her.

01:11.250 --> 01:14.667
How would you feel
about relocating to Tokyo?

01:14.667 --> 01:16.458
I'm going to become a therapist.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.834
I'm moving to Japan.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.333
Desi is not here.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.333
You're gonna go up there,

01:20.333 --> 01:21.417
and you're gonna
do this by yourself.

01:21.417 --> 01:22.291
(APPLAUSE)

01:22.792 --> 01:24.250
I think I made a mistake.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.583
I miss you so badly.

01:26.959 --> 01:28.000
I can't.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.458
- ( music playing )
- ( birds chirping )

01:48.000 --> 01:49.500
It's gonna rain.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.000
Shoshanna:
Oh, it's totally
not gonna rain.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.542
It's, like, never been
about to rain less

01:52.542 --> 01:54.667
in the history
of the universe.

01:54.667 --> 01:59.000
Now, that looks great
and it's ready for some
bridesmaid-y action.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.041
By the way, living in Japan
has made me so effing good

02:01.041 --> 02:03.083
at folding, steaming,
pressing, et cetera.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.291
My friend Satako
says that I'm, like,
a complete natural

02:05.291 --> 02:07.333
and could totally
compete with the best
of them.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.542
They have this reality
TV show there called
"Fold Fold Press..."

02:09.542 --> 02:11.750
- ( door closes )
- ...which is kind of
about being human.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.583
It seems like
it's gonna rain, right?

02:13.583 --> 02:16.458
God damn it,
what is my mom
doing out there?

02:16.458 --> 02:18.750
You don't
understand something here.
I just want to show you.

02:18.750 --> 02:23.250
It's gotta be candle,
flower, candle, flower,
candle, flower.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.000
Sorry I slept so late.
Is there anything
I can do to help?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.166
Yeah, just keep the vibe,
like, super calm in here.

02:28.166 --> 02:30.375
That'd be great.
And then when the hair
and makeup artist arrives,

02:30.375 --> 02:32.083
you can start maneuvering
the appointments.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.708
Got it, on it.

02:33.708 --> 02:36.125
What do you mean by
"maneuvering the appointments"?

02:36.125 --> 02:37.750
Well, she can't do
all of us at once, right?

02:37.750 --> 02:40.125
She's not an octopus,
so I figure we need an order

02:40.125 --> 02:41.959
and you can
create the order.

02:41.959 --> 02:44.792
Cool.
I'll-- I'm gonna--
gonna do it.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.834
Marnie:
Thank you so much.
I figure each bridesmaid

02:46.834 --> 02:48.917
should take no longer
than, like, 35 minutes,

02:48.917 --> 02:51.667
and that leaves me
three and a half hours,
which is perfect.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.792
- Great.
- ( door opens )

02:53.792 --> 02:55.875
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:55.875 --> 02:59.417
Oh, wow. You look
so whimsical/beautiful.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.583
Thank you, I just
bathed in the stream

03:01.583 --> 03:05.125
and then I ran through
the field to dry myself.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.041
Marnie, what's wrong?

03:07.041 --> 03:09.750
I'm worried it's gonna rain.
I had the option for a tent,

03:09.750 --> 03:11.125
but of course
I didn't take it.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.041
Okay, so you
made a mistake.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.792
We all make mistakes.
It's okay.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.625
Yeah, everybody
hates tents anyways.

03:16.625 --> 03:19.083
Like, what,
is this a circus?
I don't want no big top.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.917
Jessa:
But you know that rain
on your wedding day

03:20.917 --> 03:23.542
means wonderful things
for your fertility.

03:23.542 --> 03:26.417
So I hope
that it does rain.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.083
I'm gonna go
set out your dress.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.500
If anyone
needs anything,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.417
I'll be upstairs
in the boudoir.

03:39.959 --> 03:41.625
( whispers )
I love tents.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.875
This is the day.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.208
This is my wedding day.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.166
( knocks )

03:56.000 --> 03:57.583
- Hi!
- Hey.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.834
- How's it going?
- Good, how you doing?

03:58.834 --> 04:00.625
Mm, good.
Good to see you.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.041
Fran:
You, too.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.417
Hey, gals.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.250
Ooh, Fran,
you look so handsome.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.792
That is beautiful suiting.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.125
Well done, sir.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.291
- Hey, Fran.
- Marnie, hey.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.000
I just wanted to say
how grateful I am
to be invited.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.417
Oh, well,
everyone who asked
for a plus one got one.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.333
Shosh didn't ask
for one, though.

04:17.333 --> 04:20.041
Oh, yeah, I just--
I take my bridesmaids duties,
like, super seriously.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.041
Also, I'm in a long-distance
relationship,

04:22.041 --> 04:24.083
so, like, why rock the boat
by seeing each other,
you know what I mean?

04:24.083 --> 04:25.417
Well, Fran was just
sitting in his car,

04:25.417 --> 04:27.250
so I said he could
come hang with us.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.500
But I can go if this
is not a good time.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.500
Well, you are here,
like, super early.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.750
No, it's a great time.
We're doing literally
nothing.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.000
Fran:
Sweet.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.959
- How was your drive?
- Yeah, super easy.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.667
Hannah:
It's so pretty
on the way up here.

04:39.667 --> 04:42.208
- ( whispers )
Shosh! Come here.
- Yeah?

04:42.208 --> 04:44.750
Was there a mom
or was it just like
a flock of little lambs?

04:44.750 --> 04:45.875
No, orphans.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.500
This is
so inappropriate.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.250
My attire?
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.166
I thought we were, like,
doing a PJ thing all day.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.959
- I mean,
I have another outfit--
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.208
Shh.
Fran.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.542
- Oh, my baby got out!
- Hannah: No.

04:57.542 --> 05:01.708
He has an actual penis.
He's a man and he's here.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.375
You have to go
tell him to leave,

05:03.375 --> 05:04.875
and then you have
to tell Hannah

05:04.875 --> 05:06.208
that she's been
so inappropriate

05:06.208 --> 05:08.291
and unsupportive
for me all day.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.917
Wouldn't you
rather do that?

05:09.917 --> 05:12.250
That just seems like
something that you would
really enjoy doing.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.208
- Shosh.
- Okay, on it.

05:14.208 --> 05:16.333
- ...breakfast yet.
- What do you mean,
you didn't order it?

05:16.333 --> 05:17.667
- Or it didn't show up?
- I mean, it was fine.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.417
No, no one just
mentioned breakfast.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.208
Fran...

05:21.208 --> 05:25.166
so, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave,

05:25.166 --> 05:29.208
just 'cause
it's women's hour.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.458
Shosh.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.166
No.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.583
Shosh.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.125
Don't go, stay.
It's fine.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.250
I mean,
if you want him to go.

05:38.250 --> 05:42.542
But, as the bride,
I just want you to know
that I'm fine.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.708
Cool if you stay.

05:43.708 --> 05:46.625
Totally fine if Shosh
wants you to leave.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.458
Up to you.

05:48.458 --> 05:52.834
( music playing )

05:52.834 --> 05:54.792
- Ugh, weddings.
- Hannah.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.417
I'm sorry, it's just
they're stupid.

05:56.417 --> 05:57.917
They're so stupid
and you know what?

05:57.917 --> 05:59.500
Ultimately,
they're selfish.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.959
Not all weddings.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.458
I mean, yeah, if you
put too much weight

06:02.458 --> 06:03.917
on the dumb details,
sure, but this--

06:03.917 --> 06:06.583
Marnie, like,
passive-aggressively
handed me a razor.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.625
I was like, "I already
shaved my armpits."

06:08.625 --> 06:11.500
To be fair,
you're not great at it.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.542
It's, like,
pretty patchy
under there.

06:13.542 --> 06:15.708
- ( laughs ) It's hard.
- Consistently patchy.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.000
No.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.625
Look, just try
and be positive, okay?

06:19.625 --> 06:21.291
And it's all gonna
be over soon.

06:21.291 --> 06:23.458
Yeah, but then
she's gonna be married.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.959
- To someone she barely knows.
- She barely knows him?

06:26.959 --> 06:30.166
No, I barely know him.
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.000
( music playing )

06:32.000 --> 06:33.458
- Hey.
- Hannah: Hey.

06:33.458 --> 06:34.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.375
- Hey.
- What are they...

06:36.375 --> 06:38.834
Ray:
Oh, yeah, they're actually
not here right now.

06:38.834 --> 06:41.458
- Yeah, they're transcending.
- Hannah: Got it.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.959
Should be back
any minute, though.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.458
Just wait around.

06:44.458 --> 06:48.083
Marnie kicked
Fran out of the house
for female reasons,

06:48.083 --> 06:49.959
so can you
take care of him?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.792
- Yeah, sure.
Have a seat.
- Fran: Awesome.

06:51.792 --> 06:55.875
Yeah, settle in, son,
and just let the nightmare
wash over you.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.458
It's nice in here.
It's very, like,

06:57.458 --> 07:01.083
Skull and Bones,
secret gentlemen's
society.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.708
Hi.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.792
Hi, hi.
Oh, hello.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.375
Suit looks great.
Very...

07:06.375 --> 07:07.750
( clicks tongue )
...serious.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.792
- I have to, um...
- Thank you.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.333
...get back to the house
or everyone's boobs are
going to explode.

07:12.333 --> 07:13.708
Okay.

07:15.792 --> 07:18.500
♪ Out there
on the hill ♪

07:18.500 --> 07:21.500
♪ Beneath the earth
you till ♪

07:21.500 --> 07:23.875
- ♪ All you need
to know... ♪
- Hey, man.

07:23.875 --> 07:26.959
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.250
I'm, uh, just...

07:29.250 --> 07:31.834
Oh, how-- how--
how-- um...

07:31.834 --> 07:34.625
Uh, you know, nothing--
nothing doing, but...

07:34.625 --> 07:37.166
Oh, good, good, good.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.667
Look, uh,
if you need me to--

07:39.667 --> 07:41.166
I can-- I can just--

07:41.166 --> 07:43.208
No, no, no, no.
No.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.291
Fran:
I didn't just--
I'm not-- I didn't just--

07:45.291 --> 07:47.542
Adam:
No, I figured with,
uh-- with, uh...

07:47.542 --> 07:48.875
Yeah, but it's--

07:48.875 --> 07:50.458
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.417
Why don't you guys
try a few complete
sentences?

07:52.417 --> 07:55.625
This conversation
sounds like a fucking
e.e. cummings poem.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.333
Wow, I feel good, man.
I feel incredible.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.291
- All right.
- Thank you.

08:00.291 --> 08:01.959
Yeah, I thought
meditation was just naps,

08:01.959 --> 08:03.583
but it's like
a whole thing.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.041
Man:
Well, you know, it is.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.041
It's like naps
where you wake up.

08:07.041 --> 08:10.041
And I'm so happy
to be able to share that
with both of you.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.458
And you, you, oh!

08:11.458 --> 08:12.834
I'm so proud
of you, man.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.083
Oh, thank you, baby.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.417
Yes, you guys, listen.
You guys, all of you.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.917
One, two, three,
four, five,

08:18.917 --> 08:22.333
thank you for being here.
It means so much to me.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.250
- Wolfie, my old,
dear friend.
- Mm-hmm.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.917
My bald eagle,
looking out for me
from on high.

08:26.917 --> 08:32.207
Adam, man,
my comrade in arts,
my comrade-in-arms.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.582
- Mr. Rabbit.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.917
Desi:
Elijah, the lion.

08:36.917 --> 08:42.917
A comic persona
as skilled and radical
as Lucille Ball.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.708
I mean that.

08:45.708 --> 08:49.375
Ray, when Marnie told me
that you should be here,

08:49.375 --> 08:52.875
I thought it was a mistake,
and, you know, maybe it
still will be a mistake,

08:52.875 --> 08:56.917
but right now I feel like
I'm happy that you're here.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.708
Thank you for being here.

08:59.708 --> 09:01.500
Thanks.

- Fran.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.500
- Hey, man.
- I'm Hannah's boyfriend.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.250
- We met
at Marnie's birthday.
- No, I know.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.083
We went on
a bike ride together,
just you and me.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.333
- You don't--
- Yeah, Fran.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.708
- I love that name.
- Fran: Yeah.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.041
I love you, Fran.

09:25.041 --> 09:27.667
I love you, too, man.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.417
Desi: This is among
one of the greatest days
of my life, you guys.

09:30.417 --> 09:31.917
I'm getting married today.

09:31.917 --> 09:35.166
- ( Wolfie claps ) Yes.
- Elijah: Yep.

09:35.166 --> 09:36.917
Fran:
Does anybody want a beer?

09:36.917 --> 09:38.458
I have got
this really good brew

09:38.458 --> 09:40.625
- that you can only get upstate.
- No, thank you, Fran.

09:40.625 --> 09:44.834
Yeah, I'm gonna take MDMA
just before the vows,
so I shouldn't mix.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.125
Well, Fran,
I'd fucking love one.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.708
Comin' in hot.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.500
So, I've been living
in Japan for, like,
seven months now,

09:51.500 --> 09:53.333
and it has seeped
into my soul.

09:53.333 --> 09:56.166
Like, I swear,
influenced me
professionally,

09:56.166 --> 09:58.000
spiritually,
the way I bathe,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.917
my choice of pens,
everything.

09:59.917 --> 10:02.041
Woman:
But how do you understand
what the fuck they're saying?

10:02.041 --> 10:03.500
I don't get it.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.458
Oh, no, they speak
better English than,
like, any of us.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.750
- Do they, really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.834
- No kidding.
- So, Bay-Bay...

10:08.834 --> 10:10.166
Yeah?
No, Bebe, thank you.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.333
Oh, I'm sorry, Bebe.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.625
I'm so happy you're here.

10:12.625 --> 10:14.500
Thank you for joining us.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.959
Aw, thanks.
I'm happy to be here.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.125
- This is really fun.
- Oh, good, good, good.

10:18.125 --> 10:21.041
I saw on your website
you did Sophia Bush's makeup
for her sister's wedding.

10:21.041 --> 10:23.333
I sure did.
You know what?
That was such a treat.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.125
She is like
a little angel.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.375
She let me bring
my 30-year-old daughter
along and we had a ball.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.417
I gotta tell you what,
those Bushes know how to party.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.208
You have
a 30-year-old daughter?

10:32.208 --> 10:34.375
- When did you have her?
- Oh, God, I don't know.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.458
Okay, well, let's just
talk about the aesthetic
of the wedding.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.542
- Okay.
- We're thinking
Laurel Canyon classic.

10:38.542 --> 10:39.875
So, does that mean
anything to you?

10:39.875 --> 10:41.875
Like, a Selena Gomez
kind of thing?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.291
Nope, let me try that
one more time.

10:44.291 --> 10:47.208
Let's do
like a Ralph Lauren
and Joni Mitchell.

10:47.208 --> 10:50.166
Artistic, but also with a nod
to my cultural heritage,

10:50.166 --> 10:52.166
which is white
Christian woman.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.708
My fiancé and I,
both musicians.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.208
Okay, so Jesus.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.500
Selena Gomez meets Jesus.
I can do it.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.041
Yeah, so, right now
Shosh's hair

11:02.041 --> 11:04.125
feels a little bit
Japanese-y to me.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.208
Just getting started.
Don't worry, honey,
it's gonna be great.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.792
- Okay, great.
- Just go have yourself
a glass of wine.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.291
- Relax.
- Do whatever you wanna do.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.625
I'm totally easy,
easygoing girl.

11:11.625 --> 11:13.458
- You know me, right?
- Okay.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.250
Just make sure you run
everything by me before
it's final.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.750
I just wanna make sure
I sign off on it

11:16.750 --> 11:18.959
before it's set
in its spray, okay?

11:18.959 --> 11:20.875
Thank you so much
for being here, good-bye!

11:20.875 --> 11:23.291
Oh, my God,
it is so much fun.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.625
( gasps )

11:28.625 --> 11:31.750
- ( laughing )
- Oh, fuck you.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.959
It's horrendous.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.458
( laughing )
It's nice.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.083
I think
when it comes down,
I'm gonna...

11:36.083 --> 11:38.917
- Oh, oh, oh,
it's not done?
- ...brush it.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.000
( both laugh )

11:41.000 --> 11:42.250
You look good.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.333
Thank you.
I found this.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.500
Thanks, oh.

11:50.125 --> 11:53.792
Honestly, I feel
really bad for Marnie.

11:53.792 --> 11:57.417
- Why?
- Her mother's
a fucking lunatic.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.708
Hannah
is just being Hannah.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.625
Shoshanna, since she
got back from Japan

12:02.625 --> 12:05.291
is somehow even more
like a cartoon.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.667
( laughs )

12:07.667 --> 12:10.625
I'm just trying to be
a source of support.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.875
- Thanks.
- That's good.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.708
- Yeah.
- That's good,
be of service.

12:14.708 --> 12:17.208
Mm-hmm.
And how is it
over there?

12:17.208 --> 12:20.959
You guys just
doing circle jerks
and pounding beers?

12:20.959 --> 12:22.750
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.583
And what about Fran?
Is it weird?

12:24.583 --> 12:28.291
( inhales deeply )
Who's Fran?

12:28.291 --> 12:30.166
What do you mean,
who's Fran? Fran.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.959
( stammers )
Oh, yeah, he's--
he's nice.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.834
What do you mean
he's nice?

12:35.834 --> 12:38.667
He's nice.
He's polite.
He's funny or whatever.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.000
You don't wanna take him
out back and show him
what you're made of?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.708
- No.
- Buy him a ticket
to the gun show?

12:42.708 --> 12:46.166
( laughs )
Yes. No.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.750
You're a liar.

12:47.750 --> 12:51.667
No, no, no.
I'm-- I'm evolved.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.959
- That's good.
- I don't care.

12:53.959 --> 12:56.375
- I'm happy for her.
- Cool.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.083
Great.
I don't care either.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.125
Well...

13:08.625 --> 13:10.792
( exhales )

13:10.792 --> 13:14.041
I-- I can't.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.708
Okay, see ya.

13:34.959 --> 13:37.625
( sighs )

13:37.625 --> 13:39.792
( thunder rumbling )

13:39.792 --> 13:41.625
Shit.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.333
So, Fran...

13:49.708 --> 13:51.166
- Fran.
- Hmm.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.208
You seem like
a nice guy,

13:53.208 --> 13:58.458
but I have to ask--
what are your intentions
with Hannah?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.458
Uh, well, right now,
I guess we're just trying
to figure out--

14:02.458 --> 14:04.458
Ray:
Well, here's the thing
to know, Fran,

14:04.458 --> 14:07.834
is that while she's
painfully narcissistic,
shockingly tone-deaf,

14:07.834 --> 14:11.250
and just generally
one of the most insufferable
people you'll ever meet,

14:11.250 --> 14:13.041
she means
something to me.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.250
She's like
a younger sister
to me, Fran.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.375
So, what I want
to know from you

14:17.375 --> 14:19.166
is are you serious
about this?

14:19.166 --> 14:23.750
Or are you just in it
for a quick, you know,
push-push-in-the-bush?

14:23.750 --> 14:25.250
( laughs )
What?

14:25.250 --> 14:26.542
Are you trying
to get to know this woman?

14:26.542 --> 14:27.834
Are you trying
to really connect

14:27.834 --> 14:29.583
to this other individual
in this world?

14:29.583 --> 14:31.667
Or are you
just experimenting

14:31.667 --> 14:33.583
with more and more
complex sexual positions

14:33.583 --> 14:35.750
until her knees blow out
and her pussy turns to rubber?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.250
Oh, my God.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.291
I mean, do you ask her
how she feels about things?

14:39.291 --> 14:41.291
What she's thinking about?

14:41.291 --> 14:43.250
What are her opinions
about, you know,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.625
transgender politics,
the afterlife?

14:45.625 --> 14:48.959
Because young men today,
they don't ask those type
of questions.

14:48.959 --> 14:52.458
All they ask
is what they can get
from a given situation.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.708
They demand faithfulness

14:55.708 --> 14:58.166
and then they suck
the spirit out of women

14:58.166 --> 15:01.000
who are
so fucking spirited.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.792
( groans )

15:09.792 --> 15:11.542
Ray?

15:12.875 --> 15:16.458
The love of my life
is getting married today.

15:16.458 --> 15:21.959
Today, the love of my life
is getting married,

15:21.959 --> 15:26.458
and I don't have the guts
to pull a "Graduate."

15:27.792 --> 15:29.708
I don't have it in me.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.708
Because I know

15:32.708 --> 15:34.750
I'm not the person
that she wants.

15:34.750 --> 15:38.000
I can't do it.
I can't do it!
I can't fucking do it!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.500
- Desi, come on.
- I'm too fucking scared.

15:40.500 --> 15:44.333
- I'm not fucking ready.
- Take this rage and turn it
into bravery.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.125
Don't try
and follow me.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.583
Hey, hey, you've
bailed seven times.

15:47.583 --> 15:48.750
Don't make it eight!

15:48.750 --> 15:50.792
- ( Desi moans )
- Desi!

15:50.792 --> 15:52.333
What was that?

15:54.041 --> 15:56.333
Just a little bit
of cold feet.

15:56.333 --> 15:59.792
You know, he's always quick
on the engagement trigger,

15:59.792 --> 16:02.291
but I thought that eight
was the magic number.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.875
And I thought that
he was actually into Marnie

16:04.875 --> 16:06.834
since they were going
through with this.

16:06.834 --> 16:10.959
But now is now.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.125
All right,
I'll be back.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.875
Hey, be gentle
on him, brother.

16:16.875 --> 16:20.041
He's got a really
complicated thing
with his mom.

16:20.041 --> 16:24.083
Okay, here we go.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.792
Ow.

16:25.792 --> 16:29.166
Okay, I'm sorry,
but that flower crown
is corny as hell.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.875
Mom, no one
asked you.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.834
You have
a beautiful forehead.
Please do not cover it.

16:33.834 --> 16:35.291
And why do you want
to look like

16:35.291 --> 16:37.208
the Statue of Liberty
in all your wedding pictures?

16:37.208 --> 16:38.625
No, Mom,
it's super modern.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.708
Bill de Blasio's daughter
wears one all the time.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.000
Ah, Bebe, that pin
literally went through
my skull.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.083
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.458
- Marnie...
- Yes, Mom.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.041
- ...keep it classic, please.
- Okay, okay.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.417
I wore shoulder pads
to my wedding

16:49.417 --> 16:51.959
and I regret it every time
I look at those photos.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.750
More than you regret
marrying the sex addict
who's also in those photos?

16:54.750 --> 16:57.750
Uh, yeah, 'cause that
was fun for a while.
( chuckles )

16:57.750 --> 17:00.291
Bebe: Well, you know,
I was on the Vans
Warped Tour this summer

17:00.291 --> 17:02.208
and I saw
Vanessa Hudgens
in the pit

17:02.208 --> 17:04.708
and she had
one of these crowns on
and you look just like her.

17:04.708 --> 17:05.916
Well, that's just
great and weird.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.583
Just when we ask
for second opinions,

17:07.583 --> 17:09.083
we'll come to you
right away, okay?

17:09.083 --> 17:10.666
- We're good.
- Okay.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.959
And this is my daughter
and this is my day.

17:12.959 --> 17:15.000
Okay, I'm gonna start
on someone else

17:15.000 --> 17:16.416
while you two work
this thing out, all right?

17:16.416 --> 17:17.875
- Okay.
- Good idea.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.208
- Okay, good.
- Okay, yeah, that's good.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.625
( whispers )
She's crazy.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.083
I'm gonna kill you.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.541
- Hey, sugar.
- Hi.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.083
All right,
what are you thinking
for your look?

17:25.083 --> 17:27.290
Um, I don't know,
just maybe wet a comb

17:27.290 --> 17:28.792
and just
neaten my hair up.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.208
I don't know.
My hair's pretty short,

17:30.208 --> 17:31.708
so you can't really
do anything with it.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.500
But we have all
the hair accessories.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.625
I'd rather just
feel like myself.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.500
Okay, well, it's not really
about you, but whatever.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.792
Yeah, I mean,
it's not like you
don't have options.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.000
I pulled together a bunch
of the different looks
from the mood board.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.208
They're all in the iPad.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.625
You can flip through them
one more time.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.458
There's floral crowns,
obviously.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.000
There's braid headband.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.250
Um, we have extensions.
We can give you a weave.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.542
You forage for stuff
outside and put it in
your fucking hair.

17:53.542 --> 17:55.625
I don't care.
You just have
to wear something.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.166
You know,
I'd rather not.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.458
Oh, well,
we'd rather you did.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.667
Marnie:
Mom, let me handle this.

17:59.667 --> 18:00.875
Hannah, you have to.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.750
This is part of
a very specific vision

18:02.750 --> 18:04.375
that I had
for this wedding.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.333
A vision from
an Edward Sharpe video
and it is mine.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.500
Ow! Ow, ow.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.834
I'm sorry,
you just burned me.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.917
- All right, sit still.
- No! No.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.667
- Jesus.
- I can't do this!

18:14.667 --> 18:17.625
Marnie, why do you
even bother with that girl?

18:17.625 --> 18:19.041
( sighs )

18:19.041 --> 18:21.041
Honestly, you look
like a Starbucks cup.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.834
Out.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.917
( moaning )

18:26.500 --> 18:29.000
( groans )

18:32.500 --> 18:35.041
( exhales )

18:37.792 --> 18:39.500
It's so awful
in there, Fran.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.333
It's like I can't
even describe it.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.542
It's like a rom-com
that even I wouldn't
want to watch.

18:43.542 --> 18:46.917
Can you please pull
on my sleeve-- whatever
the fuck this is?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.417
What are you doing here?
It's like a noose.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.166
It's like
a really bad rom-com

18:50.166 --> 18:53.000
that's,
like, too obvious
and not funny.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.208
I hate this dress.
The straps are longer
than the dress.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.250
Yeah.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.750
I mean, I guess
you're right.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.875
At least soon she'll be
all married and happy and--

19:00.875 --> 19:04.417
Oh, Hannah, I just learned
something kind of intense
in there.

19:04.417 --> 19:05.917
Oh, yeah,
Ray was circumcised
when he was 20,

19:05.917 --> 19:07.417
so his dick does
this thing where it,
like, bleeds--

19:07.417 --> 19:10.708
No, no, I know.
No, I know about that.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.708
No, um, it's Desi.

19:12.708 --> 19:15.333
This is his
eighth engagement.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.542
What?

19:17.542 --> 19:19.041
Yeah.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.834
I mean, you know,
never a wedding, but...

19:21.834 --> 19:24.000
( laughs )
...he's freakin' out.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.667
- And that ring,
the ring for Marnie?
- Yeah?

19:26.667 --> 19:28.250
That was for
his ex-girlfriend.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.333
- Clementine?
- Yeah.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.792
I knew she had
a fruit name.

19:31.792 --> 19:33.792
Oh, my God, I have to
go tell Marnie right now.

19:33.792 --> 19:37.000
No, Hannah, you can't.
No, no, no, I just told
you in confidence.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.625
I trusted you.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.750
I have to tell her.
There's no way she knows.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.125
- She must know.
- There's no way she knows.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.417
She must've picked up
on something, anything.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.083
- You'd be surprised
how much she can miss.
- ( thunder rumbling )

19:48.083 --> 19:51.375
( rain pattering )

19:52.875 --> 19:54.625
Oh, fuck.

19:59.417 --> 20:00.625
Now I don't have
to tell her anything

20:00.625 --> 20:02.125
'cause she's gonna
kill herself.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.583
Hannah.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.166
Ray:
Desi!

20:19.625 --> 20:21.458
Desi!

20:22.750 --> 20:24.792
What the fuck
are you doing?

20:24.792 --> 20:29.125
You're right!
I don't deserve her!

20:29.125 --> 20:30.959
Get out of the pond!

20:30.959 --> 20:33.208
I'm garbage!

20:33.208 --> 20:36.166
I'm a garbage person!

20:36.166 --> 20:37.625
Okay, let's wrap up
the one-man show

20:37.625 --> 20:39.333
and get you up
to dry land, okay?

20:39.333 --> 20:41.792
Oh, what do you care?
You still love her.

20:41.792 --> 20:46.166
Yeah, but I still
don't want you to die
of a rare pond disease.

20:49.125 --> 20:50.708
Oh, what am I doing?

20:50.708 --> 20:52.250
Fuck!

20:52.250 --> 20:55.458
What am I doing, Ray?
I don't know how
to be a husband.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.125
No.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.375
No, you don't.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.708
But you know what being
a husband is about, Desi?

21:02.708 --> 21:04.500
It's about love.

21:04.500 --> 21:08.667
And love is about
sacrifice and destiny

21:08.667 --> 21:11.500
and making a sacrifice
for the one you love

21:11.500 --> 21:15.458
that allows them
to find their destiny.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.166
You know?

21:17.166 --> 21:18.708
Yes.

21:18.708 --> 21:21.125
- Yeah.
- Destiny.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.417
- Yes.
- Yeah.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.000
- Destiny.
- Yeah.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.792
You sacrificed Marnie
so she could find
her destiny!

21:27.792 --> 21:30.417
And I am that destiny!

21:30.417 --> 21:33.834
And I'm not gonna let
a couple of fucking little
botched marriage attempts

21:33.834 --> 21:37.041
on my part get in the way
of her happiness!

21:37.041 --> 21:39.125
Well, that's not
exactly what I'm saying.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.500
- What I'm saying--
- Thank you, Ray.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.125
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.208
But what I'm saying
is you should allow her--

21:45.208 --> 21:47.667
Let's ditch
this pisshole!

21:47.667 --> 21:50.625
I got a fuckin'
woman to marry!

21:50.625 --> 21:53.083
Okay, but-- Desi?

21:54.417 --> 21:56.834
H-hold on

22:40.583 --> 22:42.834
I think I just
need to powder you
and we're good.

22:42.834 --> 22:44.875
Uh, I think
it's a little heavy.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.250
No, no, no,
no, no, honey,

22:46.250 --> 22:48.291
this is the exact
right look for this dress.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.667
You see, your dress is light,
so we gotta weigh it down
on the face.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.583
- Even the lips?
- Yes.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.708
- Okay. Are you sure?
- I've been doing this
for 25 years.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:57.792 --> 22:59.125
Oh, my God.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.375
What the fuck
is your fuckin' problem?

23:00.375 --> 23:01.959
Hannah:
I don't have a problem.

23:01.959 --> 23:05.875
I just think
that the makeup
is a little bit, um...

23:05.875 --> 23:07.125
shellacked.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.542
It looks like you went
to Hershey, Pennsylvania,

23:08.542 --> 23:10.041
and just went, like...
( vocalizes )

23:10.041 --> 23:11.208
It's just a lot.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.959
Well, have you ever
even worn makeup before?

23:12.959 --> 23:15.542
Yes, I wear mascara
every Saturday.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.125
Yeah, the dress is light,
so we have to weigh it down
with makeup.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.708
You guys think that maybe
this is a little bit heavy?

23:20.708 --> 23:23.291
You know what?
You all are a bunch
of bitches.

23:23.291 --> 23:26.041
Do you know that?
Sophia Bush, grateful.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.250
You, twats.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.083
Twat, twat, twat.
An army full of twats.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.959
- Why does Bebe
do this to herself?
- Oh, no, fuck, no, Bebe.

23:31.959 --> 23:34.625
- I look fucking insane!
- You look fucking beautiful!

23:34.625 --> 23:37.750
No, I don't,
and it's fucking raining!

23:37.750 --> 23:39.125
But fertility!

23:39.125 --> 23:41.667
Everyone, shut the fuck up
about fertility!

23:41.667 --> 23:43.875
"Oh, fertility.
You're gonna get
fucking pregnant."

23:43.875 --> 23:46.250
What if I don't want to?
I wear an IUD for a fucking
reason.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.166
And it's raining
on my fucking wedding day!

23:48.166 --> 23:50.291
Fuck!
Ahh!

23:50.291 --> 23:51.875
Fuck!

23:53.750 --> 23:57.625
Weddings.
It's to be expected.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.667
- ( knock on door )
- Go away.

24:03.667 --> 24:04.625
- Hannah: Marn?
- No!

24:04.625 --> 24:06.166
- Marn, please.
- No.

24:06.166 --> 24:07.792
Hannah, I don't feel like
getting in a fucking fight

24:07.792 --> 24:09.291
with you right now,
seriously.

24:09.291 --> 24:10.792
I'm not gonna get
in a fight with you.

24:10.792 --> 24:14.208
I just want to say
that you look beautiful.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.500
Are you fucking
kidding me?

24:15.500 --> 24:18.542
You do.
You look so beautiful.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.291
My makeup is insane.

24:20.291 --> 24:21.583
It's not insane, okay?

24:21.583 --> 24:24.542
If we just take it down
a little...

24:24.542 --> 24:26.166
around the face...

24:27.875 --> 24:29.542
I'm sorry.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.208
I'm so sorry.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.458
I have been
so fucking awful today.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.834
- Yeah.
- I don't know
what to say.

24:36.834 --> 24:39.959
I don't have a good excuse
except that I was scared.

24:39.959 --> 24:42.125
What?
What the fuck
are you scared about?

24:42.125 --> 24:44.041
Marn, you're
getting married.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.542
That's a big deal.

24:46.542 --> 24:48.125
That's everything
changing.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.625
And you're marrying Desi,
who I barely even know.

24:50.625 --> 24:52.959
That's because you haven't
even tried to know me.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.542
I don't know
what that even means.

24:55.542 --> 24:58.458
Hannah, it has literally
been years since you
checked in with me

24:58.458 --> 25:00.041
to see, like,
where I'm at.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.667
I'm not dumb.
I know you guys
are laughing at me

25:02.667 --> 25:05.083
and wondering what
stupid fucking mistake

25:05.083 --> 25:06.417
Marnie's gonna
make next.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.500
But I have
been there for you

25:08.500 --> 25:11.750
and I have stood by you
while you've made some
huge mistakes.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.917
So the very least
you could do right now

25:13.917 --> 25:17.458
is to pretend that I might
be doing the right thing.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.417
You're totally right.

25:24.583 --> 25:28.166
I have made a lot
of really dumb mistakes.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.708
Do you think
I'm making a mistake?

25:32.917 --> 25:34.959
I'm not
the right person--

25:34.959 --> 25:36.583
Do you?

25:38.583 --> 25:40.417
No.

25:40.417 --> 25:43.458
No, I am with you
every step of the way.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.750
Okay.

25:48.834 --> 25:51.500
I'm sorry.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.250
I'm excited.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.708
Yeah, good.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.792
Who's the guy
with the beard
and the long hair

26:03.792 --> 26:05.291
who showed up
in the Porsche?

26:05.291 --> 26:06.834
That guy.
That one.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.792
Oh, I can't
remember his name,

26:08.792 --> 26:10.750
but I know that he splits
the Porsche with somebody.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.625
Shoshanna:
What about the guy with
the cane and the eye patch?

26:15.041 --> 26:16.333
Jesus, your faces!

26:16.333 --> 26:18.291
Excuse you?

26:19.208 --> 26:22.333
I love you.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.667
Oh, my God.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.917
It's okay.
You look great.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.166
You look really great.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.708
But my face.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.542
Okay.

26:30.542 --> 26:31.959
I'm gonna handle this.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.208
I think
she looks great.

26:33.208 --> 26:35.333
It's like you take
a tiny bit of tissue

26:35.333 --> 26:38.000
and you've
got this on lock.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.333
