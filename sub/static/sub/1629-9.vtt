NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:03.421 --> 00:05.628
You traded Baelfire
for the power of a dagger,

00:05.715 --> 00:06.704
and / traded you for youth.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.835
I was never meant to be a father.

00:09.468 --> 00:10.503
Pan's dying.

00:10.595 --> 00:12.677
He needs the heart
of the truest believer.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.594
It’s a trade. Henry will die.

00:14.891 --> 00:17.052
Your finding Henry
wasn't an accident, was it?

00:17.143 --> 00:18.929
-Whatever do you mean?
-Where did you get him?

All curses can be broken.

Their child is the key.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.936
Great power requires great sacriﬁce.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.062
Tell me what will suffice.

00:27.153 --> 00:29.439
The heart of the thing you love most.

00:31.157 --> 00:33.773
-The curse! It's here!

(WHOOSHES)

00:52.053 --> 00:53.714
What took you so long, dearie?

00:53.804 --> 00:56.181
You know what took so long.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.968
Oh, yes, the curse.

00:58.476 --> 00:59.511
You did it.

00:59.644 --> 01:00.633
That's right.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.227
(WHISPERS) I did it.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.057
And I wanted you to know it.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.357
Before you,

01:08.486 --> 01:12.900
like all the pathetic denizens
of this wretched land,

01:14.158 --> 01:15.147
forgets everything.

01:15.868 --> 01:16.948
HOW did it feel?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.027
Watching the curse cloud form?

01:19.997 --> 01:21.032
Felt like victory.

01:21.165 --> 01:24.783
(GIGGLES) No. How did it feel to kill
the thing you love most?

01:24.877 --> 01:29.120
Ripping the heart out of your father.
How did that feel?

01:29.215 --> 01:31.171
It was the price of the curse.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.629
How it felt doesn't matter.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.549
I took my life back.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.352
I had to. I won.

01:45.690 --> 01:49.854
And yet, here you are,
feeling the need to gloat.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.363
Something's missing, isn't it, dearie?

01:54.365 --> 01:57.903
Not at all. l have everything lwant.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.530
Nothing can stop me now.

(GIGGLES)

02:01.872 --> 02:03.533
Not quite.

02:12.550 --> 02:16.509
She can stop you.
She can break the curse.

02:16.595 --> 02:20.213
Well, it looks like getting rid of a baby
just made my to-do list.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.094
Of course it did.

02:22.226 --> 02:25.969
But even if you succeed with that,
you have an even bigger problem.

02:26.564 --> 02:30.102
Now there's a hole in your heart.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.478
And someday,

02:32.820 --> 02:34.606
you will come to me to fill it.

02:35.614 --> 02:39.232
You overestimate
your powers of foresight.

02:40.161 --> 02:43.824
And you underestimate
the price of what you've done.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.167

Your taunts will get you nowhere.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.627
I know you too well.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.088
You wanna make another deal.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.169
Well, I won't.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.970
(GIGGLES) A deal?

03:02.099 --> 03:05.182
You've already promised me
a good life in this new land.

03:05.311 --> 03:08.098
What more can I want from you?

03:08.606 --> 03:11.348
Oh, to be let out of this cage.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.643
To be let out of our last deal.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.862
To escape the curse.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.699
But why would I desire that, dearie?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.452
l'm exactly where I want to be.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.794
EMMA: Oh, God! Is he unconscious?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.128
REGINA: Henry, can you hear us?

03:42.223 --> 03:44.635
He passed out as soon as
his heart went into Pan.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.598
-Is he breathing?
-Just hang in there, buddy.

03:48.354 --> 03:49.764
What the hell did you do to him?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.561
Oh, ldidn't do anything, Emma.

03:51.649 --> 03:55.688
It was Henry. He offered me his heart
of his own free will.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.353
I'm gonna take it back from you.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.653
I don't think you have it in you.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.661
Rumplestiltskin didn't. Why should you?

04:07.790 --> 04:09.075
Where is he?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.155
What did you do?

04:10.334 --> 04:11.835
Why, he's right in this box.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.123
Safe and sound and out of the way.

04:15.214 --> 04:18.206
Unfortunately for you,
he can't hurt me anymore.

04:18.884 --> 04:19.999
Neither can you.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.626
-Really?
-(SLASHES)

04:21.720 --> 04:23.176
How did that feel?

04:23.681 --> 04:24.966

EMMA: HOW is he?

04:37.820 --> 04:40.732
REGINA:
You're gonna be all right, Henry.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.231
We're gonna get you home.

04:48.164 --> 04:50.029
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes, I did.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.658
If this is about Pongo's dog license,
I believe it's still up to date.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.038
This has nothing to do with your dog.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.747
Madam Mayor, are you all right?

04:59.884 --> 05:00.919
I'm okay.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.463
Excuse me for saying so,
but you don't seem okay.

05:03.554 --> 05:06.421
I don't tolerate that sort of bluntness.
I'm the...

05:10.019 --> 05:11.259
The mayor.

05:11.395 --> 05:14.182
And I'm a therapist.
That's why you asked me here, isn't it?

05:14.273 --> 05:16.764
What's bothering you?
What are you feeling?

05:16.901 --> 05:18.607
Nothing.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.736
I'm feeling nothing.

05:23.407 --> 05:27.867
If I were to guess, I would say that
you're a driven woman.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.740
And sometimes, that can leave a hole.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.279
A What?

05:32.374 --> 05:35.832
A hole. An emptiness.
There's more to life than work.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.376
And maybe that's why
you feel dissatisfied.

05:38.464 --> 05:41.877
I'm not dissatisfied. I love my life.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.707
But what's the point if you've got
no one to share it with?

05:43.802 --> 05:45.793
There's that bluntness again.

05:45.930 --> 05:50.048
Has there ever been a time in your life
when you haven't felt this way?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.803
When that little boy visited.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.097

05:55.606 --> 05:56.595

And I need your help.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.116
Well, I'm flattered, but uninterested.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.486
Not like that.

06:12.915 --> 06:16.828
I've spent all morning
talking to adoption agencies.

06:16.961 --> 06:19.327
The wait lists are over two years long.

06:20.506 --> 06:24.590
But you, Gold, you know how to
cut through red tape.

06:24.677 --> 06:29.011
And if anyone can work the system
and find me a baby, it's you.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.675
You wish to adopt?

06:30.808 --> 06:32.218
Well, don't look so surprised.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.344
Oh, I'm not.

Can you help me?

06:41.110 --> 06:42.145
Of course I can.

06:42.278 --> 06:46.146
But a word of caution. Ask yourself,
is this something you're ready for?

06:46.699 --> 06:48.155
It's something I need.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.445
Well, that may not be the same thing.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.743
I'll get you a child.

06:55.165 --> 06:59.158
But whether or not that's helping you
remains to be seen.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.500
When you become a parent,
you must put your child first.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.500
No matter what.

to go back?

-You're useless.
-Okay, enough.

07:30.326 --> 07:33.363
Don't tell me what's enough!
My son is dying.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.614
Our son.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.863
So, yes, I know how you feel.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.537
You have no idea what I feel.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.630
You have your parents.

to know what I feel?

07:52.348 --> 07:54.054
All I have is Henry.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.178
And I'm not about to lose him
because he is everything.

08:02.191 --> 08:05.524
You're right. I don't know what you feel.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.226
So, what do you wanna do?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.732
You wanna run the show? Run it.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.690
How do we save Henry?

08:14.078 --> 08:15.614
(WHISPERS) I don't know.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.989
Even if we can find Pan,
he was powerful before.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.575
With Henry's heart,
I don't know if we can hurt him.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.659
Yes, we can.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.002
Look, you nicked him.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.081
If he can bleed, we can hurt him.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.717
And if we can hurt him, we can kill him.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.095
And we will.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.279
Maybe an hour before
the preservation spell wears off.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.286
If he's airborne, he could be
anywhere on the island.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.038
An hour isn't much time.
I suggest we get started looking.

09:04.962 --> 09:05.951
Where is he?

09:07.464 --> 09:12.049
Gone. There's nothing you can do.
He's already won.

is our best move here.

Look at these kids,
they've been to hell and back.

Fate may be on your side.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.836
This morning I spoke with an agency

09:52.926 --> 09:57.795
who had placed a baby boy from
Phoenix with a family nearby in Boston.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.551
With a family? HOW is that fate?

10:00.642 --> 10:03.019
Because at the last minute,
the adoption fell through.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.189
It happens.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.356
So the baby still needs a home?

10:09.443 --> 10:13.277
Indeed. As I say, fate appears to be
on your side.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.150
The agency is in Boston.

is almost too good to be true.

are impeccable.

You're the mayor?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.753
Third term. All unopposed.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.550
Never heard of Storybrooke.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.845
Oh, it's a hidden gem.

but there's one item
I'd like to go over in detail.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.036
This is a closed adoption,

which means you'll never be able
to contact your child's birth parents.

genealogical records.

You won't have access to any of it.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.983
We are not gonna hurt you.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.987
I know you're loyal to Pan.
And I get that.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.956
But you are making a terrible mistake.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.499
For a long time I thought I was
never gonna find my family.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.090
l was an orphan, like all of you.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.292
A Lost Girl.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.382
And Iwas reminded today
that I am not alone.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.631
That I have a lot of people that love me,

12:48.143 --> 12:50.429

was gonna happen.

it can happen to you.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.358
Pan is the only family we need.

12:58.445 --> 13:02.188
No. Family doesn't do what he did.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.398
Pan lied to you and made you do
terrible things.

13:04.493 --> 13:08.111
He lied to Henry and convinced him
to give up his own heart.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.320

13:09.414 --> 13:10.824

We can take you home with us,
to our land.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.549
There's no reason to fear Pan anymore.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.474
Until he absorbs the power
from Henry's heart, he can be stopped.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.968
You just have to tell us where he is.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.730

-What?

16:00.127 --> 16:04.211
Dr. Whale, no one loves their child
more than me.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.380
Which means there's something wrong
with my son.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.546
Yourjob is to help him. Do it.

16:10.679 --> 16:14.843
Sure, I can order additional testing,
but, with babies, there are risks.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.633
And it's generally nothing
and not worth it.

16:17.727 --> 16:18.716
Generally?

16:18.854 --> 16:23.223
Well, in some cases, there could be
something abnormal happening.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.307
But we'd need the birth mother
to find out.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.734

the woman who abandoned him?

16:28.864 --> 16:32.527

I'm his mother.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.399
You misunderstand me, Regina.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.402
If something were, in fact,
wrong with the baby,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.237
maybe there's something
in her medical records,

16:39.332 --> 16:42.824
something genetic that could be
causing the problem.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.171
But the only people who can help us
fill those blanks

16:45.255 --> 16:46.665
are the biological parents.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.080
But it was a closed adoption.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.546
There's no way to contact them.

Would you like me to hold him so
we can get the last of those signatures?

25:05.505 --> 25:07.211
(SNIFFLES)
No. That won't be necessary.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.173
Henry is my son.

25:16.224 --> 25:18.180
The best thing for Henry

25:18.267 --> 25:22.260
is to stay with a mother
who will never let go of him

25:23.272 --> 25:24.432
ever again.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.939
I'm afraid there's been a hiccup.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.691
You'll have to go back
on the waiting list.

I'm sorry.

25:36.911 --> 25:38.412

25:38.496 --> 25:39.531
Yes.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.704
But I can put you back on the list.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.372
Pan will not be pleased.

25:43.459 --> 25:46.872
Which is why we don't give up.
We will get that child.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.377
Having trouble moving?
Not a surprise, given where you are.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.550
You see, what's hastening
your demise is your regret.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.138
What are you talking about?

This tree is the site
of a very important event for me.

l abandoned my boy here.

26:02.729 --> 26:03.809
You have a son?

26:03.938 --> 26:05.303
I'm older than I look.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.476
If you have a child,
you must regret losing him, too.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.647
But I don't.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.979
Quite the opposite, actually.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.862
You see, I have him all boxed up
so I don't lose him again.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.486
Rumplestiltskin is your son?

26:17.577 --> 26:18.737
That he is.

26:18.828 --> 26:21.285
How's that possible? You're...

26:21.622 --> 26:23.578
Younger than him? Not really.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.160
Just like you and your daughter.

26:25.293 --> 26:29.411
You're a fraud. Your magic is weakened.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.752
You can't even hurt us,
let alone Rumplestiltskin.

26:33.843 --> 26:37.176
You're right. But that's why I'm here.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.512
This tree will protect me
until my power is restored.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.675
And then?

26:41.350 --> 26:42.339
(SCOFFS) Well,

26:43.311 --> 26:45.017
then I get to have some real fun.

my child again.

No, you're not going to get to me.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.275
You see, this tree attacks the regret
inside anyone who comes here.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.701
And you? You've got plenty.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.287
I regret not taking a better shot at you
when I had the chance.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.330
Well, that's not all, is it, Savior?

27:08.628 --> 27:09.663
No,

27:13.883 --> 27:17.796
I can feel just how much you let him
down, time and time again.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.172
Leave her alone.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.806
Perhaps I should.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.381
After all, what chance did she have
of being a good mother?

27:23.726 --> 27:27.218
Look at the example you set,
abandoning her for 28 years.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.849
Are you finished?

27:30.066 --> 27:31.647

27:31.734 --> 27:32.894
Perhaps a deathbed confession

27:33.027 --> 27:34.813
from the one
who has the most to regret of all?

27:34.904 --> 27:37.020
Yeah, there's one problem with that.

I did cast a curse that
devastated an entire population.

I've done some terrible things.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.428
Feeling okay? Shouldn't you be resting?

40:00.857 --> 40:02.893
I can bring you some food
if you're feeling up for it.

40:02.985 --> 40:07.069
I'm feeling much better now.
I think the fresh air is good for me.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.111
Henry...

40:09.199 --> 40:10.655
(LOST BOYS SPEAK lNDlSTlNCTLY)

40:11.493 --> 40:15.862
...I know we haven't had much of
a chance to be a family. Not yet.

40:16.873 --> 40:20.001
Listen, I want you to know that
you have a dad now.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.825
Now and for forever.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.162
I'll never leave you, okay, buddy?

40:34.725 --> 40:37.137
I'm glad you got your son back, Regina.

40:37.394 --> 40:40.477
It seems the Evil Queen
was able to love someone after all.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.184
Yes, it seems.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.152
It seems you were right.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.689
I knew you still had some good in you.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.481
Apparently you still have
some magic in you.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.488
(STAMMERS) What happened?

40:55.579 --> 40:57.945
If I had to guess,
I'd say for a moment there,

40:59.333 --> 41:00.413
you believed.

41:10.886 --> 41:14.094
Go away, boy. Not hungry.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.389
But I came to thank you.

41:21.813 --> 41:26.603
No matter what those other traitors do,
I'm on Pan's side.

41:27.069 --> 41:28.058
And Pan...

41:28.153 --> 41:29.734
Never fails.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.399
-What?
-You heard me.

41:33.450 --> 41:34.940
Peter Pan never fails.

41:36.161 --> 41:40.200
He can't be stopped,
even when they think he's defeated,

41:40.916 --> 41:43.749
when they think they've won,
he finds a way.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.414
So you think you're not safe?

41:46.546 --> 41:48.411
Oh, no, I'm perfectly safe.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.540
During our struggle,
my fate was sealed.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.420
The one who's in trouble

41:54.179 --> 41:55.589
is Henry.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.554
But you're Henry.

41:58.392 --> 41:59.757
Not anymore.

42:01.895 --> 42:02.930
You...

42:05.941 --> 42:07.522
You switched.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.854
You sure you're not hungry?

42:14.241 --> 42:15.230
Thank you,

42:16.952 --> 42:17.941
Pan.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.201
Now,

42:22.708 --> 42:24.198
let's play.
