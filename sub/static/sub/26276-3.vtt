00:02.437 --> 00:05.048
Previously onMagnum P.I.:

00:05.092 --> 00:07.181
MAGNUM: When Robin Masters
offered me the job

00:07.224 --> 00:09.139
as live-in security consultant
as a way to supplement

00:09.183 --> 00:11.185
my P.I. business,
I jumped at it.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.056
This is... Juliet Higgins.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.579
Majordomo of the estate.

00:14.623 --> 00:17.147
I oversee the property and
the people that work here.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.583
So you're his boss.

00:18.627 --> 00:21.151
That would require Magnum
to actually have a job.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.892
Can you contact one
of your old MI6 buddies,

00:22.935 --> 00:25.199
run a background check?Magnum, I'm no longer MI6.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.201
[grunting and groaning]

00:27.244 --> 00:29.029
Is that necklace
really a spy camera?

00:29.072 --> 00:30.769
Touch it, I break your fingers.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.033
MAGNUM: That's Rick. If you want
something on the island,

00:33.076 --> 00:34.817
Rick is the man to see. TC: Try it.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.775
[laughs] I dare you.MAGNUM:
That's TC.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.430
He runs the best helicopter
tour business in Hawaii.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.129
Friends like those come around once in a lifetime.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.479
Up high. Oh.

00:44.522 --> 00:47.264
[classical music playing]

01:02.801 --> 01:04.934

01:04.977 --> 01:06.240

01:27.130 --> 01:28.479
WOMAN:
You know what your problem is?

01:28.523 --> 01:30.133
I'm terrible at golf?

01:30.177 --> 01:31.482
Besides that.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.224
Your club face is rotating open
on your backswing.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.139
That's why you're slicing
the ball.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.794
MAGNUM: She's right.
She's always right.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.840
And in case you're wondering,
this is Teuila Tuileta,

01:41.884 --> 01:44.147
but we call her Kumu.
It means "teacher."

01:44.191 --> 01:46.367
When Robin Masters bought
this place, Kumu came with it.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.152
Her family's been living
in this area since the 1700s.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.981
Besides being my own
personal golf pro,

01:52.024 --> 01:54.984
she's the cultural curator
of the estate.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.812
Watch your pelvic tilt.

01:56.855 --> 01:59.510
[chuckles] Big arch.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.947
Big arch.Come on, let me see
that Kardashian butt.

02:01.991 --> 02:05.734
Oh, oh, no. Less
Kim, more Kendall.[laughs]

02:05.777 --> 02:07.170
Remember,

02:07.214 --> 02:08.737
full shoulder turn.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.747
Magnum!

02:18.790 --> 02:20.140
Fore!

02:20.183 --> 02:21.489
Uh-oh.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.447
Have you lost your mind?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.449
Oh, look at the time.
I got to brief the staff.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.277
Aloha.Kumu, please stay.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.845
She was just helping me
with my long game.KUMU: I can't help it

02:29.888 --> 02:31.194
if Mr. Magnum sucks.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.109
I know you can be
a little thick, Magnum,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.284
but did you ever consider

02:34.328 --> 02:35.981
maybe turning around
and hitting the ball

02:36.025 --> 02:37.635
in the opposite direction?

02:37.679 --> 02:40.508
Oh, into the ocean so you can
have me arrested for polluting?

02:40.551 --> 02:41.813
Forget about it.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.511
You know
she would have done that.

02:43.554 --> 02:46.514
No question.Are you aware there are
over 20 public golf courses

02:46.557 --> 02:48.298
on this island?
Why don't you use one of them?

02:48.342 --> 02:50.257
Hmm, she makes a good point.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.649
Wait, whose side are you on?

02:51.693 --> 02:54.652
The side that pays my salary:
Mr. Masters.

02:54.696 --> 02:58.352
But since he's not here,
I got to back up my sister.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.180
Girl power.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.877
[phone rings]

03:03.270 --> 03:04.619
May I help you?

03:04.662 --> 03:07.187
Yeah, Luther H. Gillis
to see Magnum.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.276
[mouthing]

03:09.319 --> 03:10.494
Yes.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.366
Yes, he's right here.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.761
Hey.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.285
How you doing, Luther?

03:18.328 --> 03:19.895
Thought you were in Saint Louis.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.636
I was.Vacation?

03:21.679 --> 03:24.291
No. Skip trace.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.554
Mm-hmm.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.296
So...

03:30.471 --> 03:31.863
I know why you're here,

03:31.907 --> 03:33.909
and I just want to let you
know I'm a little light

03:33.952 --> 03:35.867
right now.Shh. Slow your roll.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.391
Dude, I didn't come here

03:37.434 --> 03:39.262
for your poker money
that you owe me.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.655
No?No.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.223
No. Came here to do you a solid.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.573
Yeah. I got you a referral.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.357
Thank you for that,

03:47.401 --> 03:48.532
but, I mean,
I'm the competition.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.273
Why would you want
to throw me a case?

03:50.317 --> 03:54.016
[laughs] First of all,
you're not my competition.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.236
Secondly, you do good work,

03:56.279 --> 03:58.673
it could square you up.
[clicks tongue]

03:58.716 --> 04:02.242
Okay, so, what's the case?

04:02.285 --> 04:03.504
Well, I'm a little sketchy
on the deets.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.333
Client's name is Neil Crawford.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.378
Nice shot.He left a message

04:08.422 --> 04:10.337
on my service
asking me to meet him

04:10.380 --> 04:11.773
over at Kings Medical today.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.776
This guy doctor or patient?Oh, dude, I don't know.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.343
I mean, some dude looking
for background information

04:16.386 --> 04:18.301
on his fiancÃ©e.
I call it a pre-prenup.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.435
Is that even a thing?

04:21.478 --> 04:23.132
It is if the check clears,
homey.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.786
[laughs]
Actually, you wouldn't know,

04:24.829 --> 04:26.135
'cause you don't have money.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.789
Anyway,

04:27.832 --> 04:29.399
I'll let him know you're coming.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.445
Don't embarrass me.

04:31.488 --> 04:34.274
And, um, also,
it would behoove you

04:34.317 --> 04:35.405
to work slowly.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.320
Maybe milk three or four days.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.235
Capisce? Yes.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.150
Oh, I forgot.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.500
Um, 60% off the top goes to me,

04:43.544 --> 04:45.676
so that should clear
your poker debt.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.462
Great. Uh, 40% plus expenses.

04:48.505 --> 04:51.378
[laughs]:
Wow, you are so funny.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.597
Expenses come
out of your end.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.946
Later, player.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.339
MAGNUM:
Okay,

04:56.383 --> 04:58.515
I have to admit,
that was a smooth move,

04:58.559 --> 04:59.777
Luther handing me a case

04:59.821 --> 05:01.431
to make sure
I paid my poker debt.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.346
I just hope
there's enough left over

05:03.390 --> 05:05.130
after this job
to fill up the Ferrari.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.436
MAN:
Mr. Magnum? Neil Crawford.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.917
This is, uh...

05:08.960 --> 05:11.267
Tara, my fiancÃ©e.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.269
Uh, can I ask what happened?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.489
I don't remember much.
It was a hit and run.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.360
HPD have any leads?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.406
No, but they're investigating.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.541
You're probably wondering why
I want to hire a P.I. right now.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.977
Figured you want
somebody outside of HPD

05:26.021 --> 05:27.370
looking for whoever hit you.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.372
Uh, yeah, no, this is...

05:29.416 --> 05:31.722
about something else. Uh...

05:32.767 --> 05:34.246
After the accident,

05:34.290 --> 05:36.292
the hospital started running
all these tests,

05:36.336 --> 05:40.165
one of which was a CAT scan,
and it revealed something...

05:40.209 --> 05:41.732
odd.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.691
Apparently,

05:43.734 --> 05:46.084
Tara had extensive
reconstructive surgery

05:46.128 --> 05:47.390
on her face.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.392
According to the doctor,
there's no sign of any

05:49.436 --> 05:50.741
physical trauma to warrant it.

05:50.785 --> 05:54.397
And we're talking
multiple operations.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.964
And you had no idea?

05:56.007 --> 05:57.400
We've been together
a couple years now,

05:57.444 --> 05:59.533
and she never said a thing.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.925
She must have had her reasons.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.624
Yeah, well, whatever they are,

06:03.667 --> 06:05.452
I'd like to know why
she changed her face,

06:05.495 --> 06:08.193
and I'm hoping
that you can find out for me.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.674
You could wait
for her to wake up.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.459
Ask her.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.504
Yeah, I could do that,
but then I'd spend the rest

06:14.548 --> 06:16.506
of my life questioning whether
or not she told me the truth,

06:16.550 --> 06:19.030
and I don't want to feel
like I can't trust her.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.425
MAGNUM:
I hear you. Walk away.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.948
This woman's got a secret
she doesn't want

06:23.992 --> 06:26.081
her fiancÃ© to know about,
but I know

06:26.124 --> 06:28.213
what it's like loving someone
you can't trust.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.693
And believe me,
that's a feeling

06:29.737 --> 06:31.913
that you don't want
to experience.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.741
Mr. Crawford...

06:33.784 --> 06:36.439
you got yourself
a private investigator.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.398
Thank you.[shake hands]

06:38.441 --> 06:40.617
â™ª

07:00.158 --> 07:02.160
MAGNUM: Most guys in
my profession will tell you:

07:02.204 --> 07:05.207
never take a case
that hits too close to home.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.817
Messes with your judgment.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.732
But if I turned my back
on every case

07:08.776 --> 07:10.821
that involved the betrayal
of a significant other,

07:10.865 --> 07:13.084
I'd have no career.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.871
Thomas Magnum.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.873
Sorry, do we know each other?

07:18.916 --> 07:20.657
Detective Katsumoto, HPD.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.617
Detective Tanaka's mentioned you
a few times.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.445
Oh, yeah, Detective Tanaka.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.664
We got this kind of,
like, mutual man crush

07:27.708 --> 07:29.753
going on, so I'm sure
it was all very positive.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.669
I heard he got promoted
to head of detectives, right?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.497
How's that going?Honestly?

07:34.541 --> 07:37.892
I think he's glad not to be
running into you anymore.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.198
[chuckles]
Well, you tell him I said aloha.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.462
Yeah, I better not.Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.900
Hey, are you, uh, handling
the hit and run?

07:45.943 --> 07:47.902
That's right.
How do you know about that?

07:47.945 --> 07:49.556
I'm doing something
for the fiancÃ©,

07:49.599 --> 07:51.514
but unrelated.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.126
Make sure it stays that way.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.433
Copy that.[elevator bell dings]

07:57.477 --> 07:59.522
[chuckles]

07:59.566 --> 08:01.524
MAGNUM: Yeah, I'm thinking
the same thing you are.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.527
Detective Katsumoto seems
like a real ray of sunshine.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
I'm sure we're gonna be
great friends.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.750
Speaking of friends,
I asked Rick

08:09.793 --> 08:11.621
to help me find someone
who could show me

08:11.665 --> 08:13.057
what Tara used to look like.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.624
For anyone else,
that might be a tall order,

08:14.668 --> 08:16.626
but Rick always seems
to know a guy.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.801
Akela, Magnum.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.543
Magnum, Akela.
This guy is the best

08:20.587 --> 08:22.893
med lab tech on the island.How you doing?

08:22.937 --> 08:25.461
Yeah, so, uh,
what do you got for me?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.768
Everything you asked for.
I got the, uh, CAT scans

08:27.811 --> 08:29.160
and some photographs.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.337
[blows]

08:32.381 --> 08:34.905
Let's see here.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.646
Huh.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.561
So, you want me

08:38.605 --> 08:40.520
to reverse-engineer
a forensic facial reconstruction

08:40.563 --> 08:43.784
based on this woman's
maxillofacial procedures, yeah?

08:43.827 --> 08:46.047
[laughing]: I have no
idea what that means.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.657
Can you just show me

08:47.701 --> 08:49.006
what Tara would
have looked like

08:49.050 --> 08:50.486
before her surgery?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.183
That's what I said.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.055
Technically,
you said it in nerd speak,

08:54.098 --> 08:56.187
which Magnum doesn't understand.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.580
And you do?

08:57.624 --> 09:00.148
I'm fluent in nerd.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.150
So...

09:02.193 --> 09:04.108
I do this for you,

09:04.152 --> 09:06.458
I get a free helicopter tour

09:06.502 --> 09:08.286
of the island?That's the deal.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.289
[exhales] Sweet.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.118
Uh, yeah.
Give me a couple hours.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.425
I'll see what I can do.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.470
Tell me you cleared this
with TC, right?

09:18.514 --> 09:19.646
Of course.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.257
Promise me
you'll leave me out of this.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.566
[footsteps approaching]

09:28.655 --> 09:31.005
Magnum, why are
you in the study?

09:31.048 --> 09:34.182
Don't mind me.
I'll just be a minute.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.619
Problem is I do mind

09:36.663 --> 09:39.622
because you're using
my computer.

09:39.666 --> 09:43.495
It's like watching a chimpanzee
trying to operate a typewriter.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.062
What are you doing?
Scratch that.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.716
What are you trying to do?

09:46.760 --> 09:50.764
Running a background check
on the fiancÃ©e of a new client.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.420
When's the wedding?Soon as she wakes up.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.726
She's in a coma.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.250
She was involved
in a hit and run.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.905
That's awful.Yeah.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.305
Oh, for God's sake.
Out of the way.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.746
First off,

10:16.790 --> 10:19.749
this database
that you're using is archaic.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.056
Mm.You're not gonna find
much of anything with this.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.667
MAGNUM: She's right. To do
a really deep background check

10:24.711 --> 10:27.104
actually requires
some next-level software,

10:27.148 --> 10:30.325
like the kind used
by intelligence agencies.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.848
Of course, someone like me
can't get access

10:31.892 --> 10:32.980
to something like that.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.721
But an ex-spy like Higgins?

10:34.764 --> 10:36.505
That's a different story.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.898
Magnum, why are you smiling?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.595
I'm not smiling.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.075
Why do I get
the distinct impression

10:41.118 --> 10:42.729
that you are toying with me?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.731
I'm afraid you'd be wrong.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.733
MAGNUM:
Okay, she's not wrong.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.257
I was slow-typing on purpose
to get her to take over.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.128
But before you go judging,
you should know

10:51.172 --> 10:53.696
that while it might seem like
Higgins is put out by this,

10:53.740 --> 10:56.264
I think she secretly misses
this kind of work.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.831
Magnum,
are you sure you're using

10:57.874 --> 10:59.136
the correct name
of your coma patient?

10:59.180 --> 11:00.355
Yeah.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.574
And how old did you say she was?I didn't.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.359
34, though. Why?

11:04.402 --> 11:05.969
Um...

11:06.013 --> 11:07.667
oh, just take a look
for yourself.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.149
It seems your client's fiancÃ©e

11:12.193 --> 11:14.021
is using
someone else's identity.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.944
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would Tara

11:23.987 --> 11:27.077
want to become someone else?I don't know.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.689
But if we can find out
who she was,

11:29.732 --> 11:31.995
then, you know, we might be able
to get some answers.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.476
Actually, this is where
you might be able to help.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.739
You see, people can
change their name,

11:36.783 --> 11:38.741
they can change
the way they look,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.787
but they can't change
who they are inside.

11:40.830 --> 11:44.399
Are there any details about Tara
that you might be able to share?

11:44.442 --> 11:47.228
Likes, uh, interests.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
That kind of stuff
can really help.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.623
Uh, I don't know where to start.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.235
I mean, she's... she reads
a lot. She's funny.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.280
She's r... she's really funny.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.587
How did you two meet?

11:58.630 --> 11:59.806
I picked her up.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.590
Literally.
I was an Uber driver,

12:01.633 --> 12:03.505
and she, uh... [clears throat]

12:03.548 --> 12:05.507
Well, Tara, she volunteers
at the Bishop Museum.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.944
She needed a ride.
She doesn't drive, so...

12:07.988 --> 12:09.467
At all?No.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.948
I mean, she doesn't need to.
She works from home.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.776
But, uh, truth is,

12:13.820 --> 12:16.039
she's-she's terrified
of getting behind the wheel.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.737
[chuckles]
I tried to teach her once,

12:17.780 --> 12:19.913
and she just took out
a parking meter.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.262
So that was the end
of that, but...

12:22.611 --> 12:23.917
MAGNUM: Is there anything
about Tara physically

12:23.960 --> 12:26.571
that can help identify her?

12:26.615 --> 12:30.053
Oh, she has a scar
where she had a tattoo removed.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.318
It's right there.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.233
Can I take a picture?Yeah.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.634
Which one of these do you think
you might want to remove?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.593
Um...

12:49.943 --> 12:51.771
All of 'em?

12:53.685 --> 12:56.514
I'm just here
for emotional support.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.516
I'm gonna need you
to disrobe.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.344
And I'm out.

13:00.388 --> 13:03.608
Uh, I'm sure you look great
au naturel, but, uh,

13:03.652 --> 13:05.523
I feel like this is
gonna take a while,

13:05.567 --> 13:08.004
so I'm gonna wait in the lobby.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.747
â™ª

13:24.934 --> 13:27.023
MAGNUM: Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.633
Using a friend
to distract a doctor

13:28.677 --> 13:31.898
and sneak a look at some files
is kind of shady.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.726
But before you judge, remember
this, looking at old photos

13:34.770 --> 13:38.078
of tattoos to help I.D. someone isn't exactly violating

13:38.121 --> 13:40.428
doctor-patient confidentiality.

13:40.471 --> 13:44.258
Also, I have a client
in desperate need of answers.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.434
If you have to judge,
trust me,

13:46.477 --> 13:48.218
I've done a lot worse.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.742
Okay, I got a hit
on your tattoo.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.222
It's linked to
an open case.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.746
Robbery-homicide. Unsolved.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.836
Robbery-homicide?Yeah,

13:56.879 --> 13:59.577
late-night smash and grab at a
jewelry store three years ago.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.057
I'm gonna need
the whole case file.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.754
That's still
an open investigation.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.018
I can get you a hard copy,
but I just got to figure out

14:05.061 --> 14:06.671
a way to justify the request.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.848
Well, how about
just the basics for now?

14:08.891 --> 14:10.023
Yeah, here we go.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.112
Vic was an employee.
Shot and killed.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.549
Homeless guy in the
alley behind the store

14:14.592 --> 14:16.203
reported seeing the same ink
on the hand

14:16.246 --> 14:17.857
of the masked suspect
fleeing the scene.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.641
This mean something to you?

14:19.684 --> 14:21.295
Yeah.

14:21.338 --> 14:24.864
Means my client's fiancÃ©e
might be a killer.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.221
It was my fault.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.744
We were closed for the day,

14:35.787 --> 14:39.139
and I... I asked my son
to go back to the store

14:39.182 --> 14:42.142
because I'd forgotten
my sunglasses.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.970
Casey must have stumbled
into the robbery.

14:44.013 --> 14:47.060
Bullet entered
his heart, and...

14:47.103 --> 14:50.411
he was... he was dead
before he hit the floor,

14:50.454 --> 14:52.717
my son.Easy, Sam.

14:52.761 --> 14:56.765
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry to make
you guys relive all this.

14:56.808 --> 14:59.681
I just have a couple
more questions.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.684
This was made by an expert in
forensic facial reconstruction.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.468
Does she look familiar?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.730
No, not to me.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.733
I don't think so.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.344
Why? Do you think
she's involved?

15:10.387 --> 15:13.086
I don't know, to be honest.
Right now, she's in a coma.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.522
And, hopefully,
when she wakes up,

15:14.565 --> 15:16.089
we might be able to
get some answers.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.483
Hey, look, I don't want
to get your hopes up,

15:19.527 --> 15:23.705
but if-if I find anything out,
I will let you know.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.926
Thank you, Mr. Magnum.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.843
MAGNUM:
Sometimes you get lucky,

15:31.887 --> 15:33.323
and the clues start falling
into place

15:33.367 --> 15:35.325
and the case
basically solves itself.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.805
Not this one.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.416
It seems like every answer
leads to more questions.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.201
Like, if Tara
was behind what happened,

15:41.244 --> 15:44.639
wouldn't it have been easier
for her to just skip town?

15:44.682 --> 15:46.989
Instead, she went through the trouble and expense

15:47.033 --> 15:49.774
of changing her face,
which makes me ask,

15:49.818 --> 15:51.211
what was she
sticking around for?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.821
[musical ringtone playing
over phone]

15:52.864 --> 15:54.388
â™ª I'm a midnight mover.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.825
I think I know
what this is about.

15:58.740 --> 16:02.526
Thomas, this is getting
ridiculous.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.093
Look, I told you before,

16:04.137 --> 16:05.877
I can't be paying off
your favors

16:05.921 --> 16:07.705
with free helicopter rides.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.707
Look, I love you, man,

16:09.751 --> 16:12.275
but I'm trying
to run a business here.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.712
It's the last time.
You hear me?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.758
Last time.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.021
[sighs]

16:19.065 --> 16:20.066
[phone chimes]

16:26.986 --> 16:29.031
[laughing]

16:32.861 --> 16:34.863
[revs engine]

16:39.781 --> 16:42.044
How'd it go
at the cultural center?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.741
Very well.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.744
I told the board members you
volunteered to do cultural tours

16:46.788 --> 16:48.224
of the estate when
I'm not available.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.878
You didn't.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.706
[chuckles]:
Of course not.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.534
You think I'd do
that to our guests?

16:53.577 --> 16:54.839
[chuckles]

17:00.323 --> 17:02.151
That for Magnum?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.587
[clears throat]

17:03.631 --> 17:05.067
Um...

17:05.111 --> 17:06.895
You're helping him,
aren't you?

17:06.938 --> 17:08.114
Absolutely not.

17:08.157 --> 17:11.421
Would it be so bad if you were?

17:17.862 --> 17:19.864
[school bell rings]

17:21.866 --> 17:23.868
[shuts off engine]

17:29.874 --> 17:30.919
You're smiling again.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.790
I'm just...
I'm happy you called.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.618
I should have done this
over the phone.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.011
No, I'm serious.
Whatever it is,

17:36.055 --> 17:37.360
it's probably important
for you to leave your post.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.797
A post is a place
at which a soldier is stationed.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.451
I, on the other hand,
am the majordomo

17:41.495 --> 17:43.975
of one of the largest estates
on the island.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.021
Yet you're here,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.154
with information
that might help me with my case.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.590
Which is what
I'm thankful for.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.026
And which is why
I'm smiling.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.810
But, you know,
if it makes you feel any better,

17:52.854 --> 17:56.031
I could-- I don't know--
listen and frown.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.381
Oh, why, thank you
for your appreciation.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.079
You can keep the frown.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.515
So what do you got?

18:01.558 --> 18:03.256
Okay, so after you left,
it occurred to me

18:03.299 --> 18:05.258
that Tara would most likely
have gone to a plastic surgeon

18:05.301 --> 18:07.695
with questionable
morals.Agreed.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.175
Cross-referencing
plastic surgeons

18:09.218 --> 18:11.699
with legal, financial
and ethical problems, I think

18:11.742 --> 18:13.788
I came up with someone who
could've done the procedures.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.181
Problem is,

18:15.224 --> 18:16.530
he passed away last year.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.620
Okay, so, basically,
you have nothing.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.404
It turns out the FBI
froze his files.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.492
Yeah.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.928
Maybe somewhere
in those files

18:23.972 --> 18:25.495
is Tara's real identity.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.801
Yeah, sure, I could do that.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.629
You know,
wait a few weeks for the FBI

18:28.672 --> 18:30.587
to release documents
to a civilian.

18:30.631 --> 18:33.634
And maybe, just maybe,
if I'm really lucky,

18:33.677 --> 18:36.724
there might be some lead
inside there worth pursuing.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.987
Or I could just go inside
this building

18:39.030 --> 18:40.989
right here,
where she volunteered.

18:41.032 --> 18:44.035
Because outside of her fiancÃ©,
the people inside there

18:44.079 --> 18:46.342
are probably the ones
who know her the best.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.040
Fine.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.913
I've never seen
this woman before.

18:51.956 --> 18:55.438
Are you sure? She told her
fiancÃ© she volunteers here

18:55.482 --> 18:56.439
three times a week.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.050
I'm sorry.
She doesn't.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.096
Thank you.Thanks.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.533
Shall we call
the FBI now?

19:03.577 --> 19:06.449
Yeah, Tara not only lied
about her past life,

19:06.493 --> 19:09.060
she's lied
about her current one, too.

19:15.937 --> 19:19.375
So, I have an appointment with
an FBI field officer tomorrow.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.724
You're welcome.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.074
It's customary to say
"thank you" first.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.467
You're not one to
stand on ceremony,

19:24.511 --> 19:25.903
so better safe
than sorry.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.383
Can I ask you a question?

19:27.427 --> 19:28.558
By all means.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.386
What are you doing here?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.345
I mean, really.
What are you doing?

19:32.388 --> 19:34.564
Pity, Magnum. Watching
you fumbling around

19:34.608 --> 19:36.479
in Mr. Masters' office,
I couldn't help but feel

19:36.523 --> 19:38.481
for the poor man
who hired you.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.266
You just can't do it,
can you?Do what?

19:40.309 --> 19:42.442
Just be a normal human being
and say,

19:42.485 --> 19:44.661
"Hey, Magnum, I wanted to help."

19:44.705 --> 19:47.011
Oh. Whoa.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.885
KIDS: Whoa![kids laughing]

19:50.928 --> 19:52.365
Used to play soccer?

19:52.408 --> 19:54.236
From kindergarten to Cambridge.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.325
But it's called "football,"
if you don't mind me saying.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.326
I mind, actually.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.458
Daft retort.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.068
I-I think that was
an insult, right?

20:00.111 --> 20:01.112
Very much so, yeah.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.418
Okay, well, good to know.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.593
I'll see you around.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.465
Wait, Magnum, I need a ride.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.770
Didn't you take an Uber here?

20:06.814 --> 20:09.469
Okay, an automobile
depreciates with every mile

20:09.512 --> 20:12.472
and consumes an exorbitant
amount of costly fuel.

20:12.515 --> 20:15.475
Plus, I, unlike some people,
don't take advantage

20:15.518 --> 20:17.738
of Mr. Masters'
goodwill constantly.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.827
Right. Okay, so I'll drop you

20:19.870 --> 20:22.917
at Robin's Nest, but I have
to make a stop first.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.746
[clacking]When you asked to make a stop,

20:25.789 --> 20:27.487
I didn't think that stop

20:27.530 --> 20:28.923
would involve
committing a felony.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.316
Oh, come on.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.056
Don't act like
you've never done this before.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.449
Oh, I have.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.798
For you.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.236
And I got shot for the trouble,
if you remember.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.283
Down and twist.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.980
I know what I'm
doing. Just...

20:43.024 --> 20:44.460
let me concentrate.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.507
[lock clicks]

21:01.695 --> 21:03.653
What are you
looking for?

21:03.697 --> 21:05.786
The spot.

21:05.829 --> 21:06.961
The spot?

21:07.004 --> 21:09.485
Yeah. Everybody's got one.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.444
Place where they hide stuff,
you know?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.359
Personal stuff.
Important stuff.

21:13.402 --> 21:16.362
Tara's got
to have one.I don't have a spot.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.841
Come on. You're telling me
you don't have

21:17.885 --> 21:19.147
a go bag stashed
somewhere?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.454
You think Tara's spot
is in her refrigerator?

21:21.497 --> 21:22.629
No.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.065
Just hungry.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.378
Tara's got
a central vacuum system.

21:32.421 --> 21:36.251
Oh, your powers of observation
are quite remarkable.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.079
No, it's not that.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.776
Why have one of these...

21:42.039 --> 21:44.303
...if she's got central vac?

21:54.051 --> 21:56.010
Admit it.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.839
Pretty good
private investigator.

21:58.882 --> 22:02.146
You have had your moments.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.105
They're all birthday cards
to a girl named Harper.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.324
Got the...

22:05.367 --> 22:07.761
eighth, ninth, tenth,

22:07.804 --> 22:09.415
unsealed, still
in the envelope,

22:09.458 --> 22:11.504
no address, unsent.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.462
HIGGINS:
"So great with your friends

22:13.506 --> 22:15.464
and so fearless
on the playground."

22:15.508 --> 22:17.553
"The way you show
respect to your teachers

22:17.597 --> 22:19.381
says a lot about you."

22:19.425 --> 22:21.427
These are very
detailed observations.

22:22.471 --> 22:25.431
Teachers, playground...

22:25.474 --> 22:28.434
Tara was definitely
keeping an eye on this girl.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.440
That's why she came here
every day.

22:34.483 --> 22:37.051
It's the perfect vantage point
to watch a kid at recess.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.277
Uh, Magnum,
you're not thinking

22:46.321 --> 22:48.279
of impersonating a
police officer, are you?

22:48.323 --> 22:50.281
Relax. It's not real.

22:50.325 --> 22:54.416
You do know what
"impersonating" means, right?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.462
[school bell rings]

23:04.034 --> 23:06.776
Harper, this is
Detective Thomas Magnum

23:06.820 --> 23:08.561
and Dr. Higgins.Hi.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.171
They need to ask you
a few questions.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.564
Is that okay?

23:11.607 --> 23:13.087
But before we get into that,

23:13.130 --> 23:15.394
can I just say
that I love your top.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.918
Thanks.
My grandma gave it to me.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.441
Oh, she's got great taste.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.443
MAGNUM: So, Harper,
I have a question,

23:21.487 --> 23:22.966
and it's a pretty easy one.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.447
I've got some photographs
I want you to look at.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.449
They're
computer-generated, okay?

23:28.798 --> 23:30.409
Do you know who this is?

23:31.975 --> 23:36.545
It kind of looks like... my mom.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.689
MAGNUM:
Giving a client bad news
is never easy.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.691
Unfortunately, it's something
I have to do a lot.

23:51.734 --> 23:55.825
I had Neil meet me at Rick's
because, well, let's face it,

23:55.869 --> 23:58.741
if your fiancÃ©e lied to you
about pretty much everything,

23:58.785 --> 24:00.787
you'd probably want
a drink after.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.745
Her real name's Emily?

24:02.789 --> 24:04.747
Emily Layton.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.969
She's got a kid?

24:09.012 --> 24:11.232
Yeah, a girl named Harper.

24:11.275 --> 24:15.497
Apparently, the father was never
really involved in her life.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.717
From what I can gather from
the school administrator,

24:17.760 --> 24:19.066
Emily was a great mom,

24:19.109 --> 24:21.198
but after the incident
at the jewelry store,

24:21.242 --> 24:23.766
she just... disappeared.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.465
Grandmother's been watching
Harper ever since.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.988
I know this is tough.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.643
Just... uh, try to keep
an open mind.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.254
Open mind?

24:33.297 --> 24:36.518
You just told me the woman
I love might be a murderer.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.521
We don't know that, though.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.828
Someone who would go
to such extreme lengths

24:41.871 --> 24:43.133
to see her daughter

24:43.177 --> 24:45.092
doesn't strike me as
the same kind of person

24:45.135 --> 24:48.008
who would shoot
someone in cold blood.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.662
Th-there's... there's
more to this case,

24:49.705 --> 24:51.402
and I-I will find the truth.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.579
No, I, um, just...

24:53.622 --> 24:55.668
I don't want to know
any more, so, uh...

24:55.711 --> 24:58.409
[sniffs]
Thank you...

24:58.453 --> 24:59.933
for everything.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.591
What are you gonna do now?

25:05.634 --> 25:08.028
I don't know.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.509
I mean, I still love her,
but even if

25:10.552 --> 25:13.337
she didn't kill that guy,
she still deceived me about...

25:13.381 --> 25:16.819
everything else, so...

25:16.863 --> 25:19.822
I'm not sure
I can get past that.

25:19.866 --> 25:23.217
MAGNUM:
Yeah, I've seen
that look before.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.958
The gut-wrenching pain
of a truth

25:25.001 --> 25:26.873
that changes your life forever.

25:26.916 --> 25:30.050
That's the look I've seen
in the mirror.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.269
Thomas, your buddy
Benny from HPD

25:32.313 --> 25:35.272
dropped that off
for you.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.797
Is that the
jewelry store case?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.626
Yep. Entire case file.

25:40.669 --> 25:44.107
Not that it matters anymore,
'cause according to my client,

25:44.151 --> 25:47.067
I did my job.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.071
It wasn't your fault, you know.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.290
I know.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.902
I'm talking about Hannah,
not your client.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.121
[chuckles] You, uh...

25:58.165 --> 26:00.297
You know, I started here
as a bartender.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.822
I read a lot of faces;
I heard a lot of stories.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.040
And let me
tell you something.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.389
I know you.

26:05.433 --> 26:06.608
And I know that look.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.784
I have a look?
Yeah.

26:08.828 --> 26:12.048
A man who feels betrayed
by the woman he's gonna marry.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.963
Sound familiar?

26:15.617 --> 26:18.968
You got the look of a guy
who identifies with your client.

26:19.012 --> 26:22.711
But here's what's different:
Hannah didn't just betray you.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.452
She hurt all of us.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.237
[sighs]

26:27.281 --> 26:29.631
And I'm gonna keep telling
you this until you believe it.

26:29.675 --> 26:30.893
TC and I,

26:30.937 --> 26:32.634
we never blamed you for it.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.985
Thanks.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.902
What's this?

26:39.946 --> 26:41.164
Nice.
Should cover your tab.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.905
What are you doing?
I need that.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.690
So do I.
You're three months behind.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.561
Tell you what, though,
I'll buy you a beer.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.172
That way, you don't feel like
all this work was for nothing.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.349
[sighs]

27:00.183 --> 27:02.272
â™ª

27:14.763 --> 27:16.678
Here you go.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.984
What is it?

27:18.027 --> 27:20.377
The sole witness who saw
Tara fleeing the scene

27:20.421 --> 27:22.118
said she went into
another alleyway,

27:22.162 --> 27:24.686
then reported a
car driving off.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.166
So she drove off
in a car, so what?

27:26.209 --> 27:28.864
So, Tara-- Emily--
she doesn't drive.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.866
She doesn't even know how.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.303
I think there was another person
involved in this crime.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.089
Sh-She had a partner. [knocking on door]

27:37.307 --> 27:39.005
Hello, Harper.

27:39.048 --> 27:40.789
Dr. Higgins?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.965
That's right,
and Detective Magnum.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.097
Is your grandmother here?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.402
Nana.

27:45.446 --> 27:48.101
You're going to sweep
the chimney for this.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.625
Uh, can I help you?

27:50.669 --> 27:51.800
Hi. Yeah,
I was wondering

27:51.844 --> 27:53.715
if we can talk to
you for a minute.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.283
It's about Emily.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.160
KITTY:
I want to see her.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.901
Harper will want to see her.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.904
I understand, but she made
the decision to disappear.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.341
Not just for her safety,
but for the two of you.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.735
She couldn't kill anybody.

28:13.779 --> 28:14.867
I believe you.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.738
Which is why I want to find out

28:16.782 --> 28:18.784
who was with her at
the jewelry store that night.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.960
Do you have any idea
who that could be?

28:21.003 --> 28:25.616
Before she left, she...
she had this boyfriend

28:25.660 --> 28:28.228
who had her
completely spun around.

28:28.271 --> 28:32.885
I never met him, but I could
tell Emily was afraid of him.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.974
Three years ago,

28:35.017 --> 28:39.543
she came to me,
wanted to borrow money.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.459
She finally admitted
it was for him.

28:42.503 --> 28:46.725
I refused, and...

28:46.768 --> 28:49.989
[crying]: that was
the last time we spoke.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.514
Can you tell us anything
about this boyfriend?

28:53.557 --> 28:56.647
I couldn't even tell you
his name.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.693
He never came to the house.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.218
Did Emily leave, um,
a cell phone behind

29:02.262 --> 29:05.308
or anything that might help
identify him?

29:05.352 --> 29:08.572
I never came across one.

29:08.616 --> 29:12.011
But her room is just
as she left it.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.927
You're welcome
to go look around.

29:40.909 --> 29:44.130
â™ª

30:10.112 --> 30:11.766
Where did Emily get this?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.421
Her boyfriend.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.640
He gave it to her after one
of their fights.

30:16.684 --> 30:19.687
I heard Emily accuse him of
stealing it from his work.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.602
What is it?

30:21.645 --> 30:22.864
Stay here, okay?

30:22.908 --> 30:24.039
Don't leave.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.649
Magnum, what's going on?

30:25.693 --> 30:27.390
[horns honking]

30:27.434 --> 30:29.175
MAGNUM: Okay, I'm gonna take
a fairly educated guess here

30:29.218 --> 30:31.481
and say that Val
from the jewelry store

30:31.525 --> 30:33.092
was Tara's mystery boyfriend,

30:33.135 --> 30:35.007
and that the two of them
pulled the robbery together.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.879
But if I'm right,
that also means I've got

30:37.923 --> 30:40.664
a pretty big problem,
because I inadvertently told

30:40.708 --> 30:43.363
Tara's accomplice that the one
person who could implicate him

30:43.406 --> 30:46.192
is laying in a hospital bed
like a sitting duck.

30:46.235 --> 30:48.063
[phone keypad beeping]

30:48.107 --> 30:49.891
[phone rings]

30:49.935 --> 30:52.154
Katsumoto.MAGNUM [on phone]:
Hey, it's Thomas Magnum.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.200
Whatever you do, just don't
hang up. It's important.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.331
Where are you?

30:55.375 --> 30:56.898
I'm on my way to the hospital.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.117
She's up.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.945
What do you mean, "up"?

30:59.988 --> 31:01.468
Tara, she's out of her coma.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.470
I'm going over to let her
and her fiancÃ© know

31:03.513 --> 31:04.950
we found the driver
that hit them.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.126
[horns honking in distance]

31:07.169 --> 31:08.257
Magnum.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.172
Uh, yeah, listen,
get to her room

I was hoping
to return it someday.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.796
Figured you'd get tired
of pretending to be

35:46.840 --> 35:48.233
a loyal employee
and move on.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.539
But you got away with
murder, and that job
