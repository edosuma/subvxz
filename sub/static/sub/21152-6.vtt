00:08.967 --> 00:10.533
- * They say the party
won't be on *

00:10.600 --> 00:13.033
* Until I get up in the place *

00:13.100 --> 00:14.667
-  I can't believe
this turnout.

00:14.733 --> 00:16.533
We have a hit on our hands.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.033
- I predicted this.
I told you I had a special dog.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.867
- You had a special editor.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.800
Liza rewrote every page
of this book.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.800
Gave it a point of view.
Wit. Irony.

00:24.867 --> 00:25.900
- I know. I know.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.400
- We did our job too well.

00:29.467 --> 00:30.700
This was supposed to
die a quiet death

00:30.767 --> 00:32.267
- I know.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.933
Hey, Amazon just
sold out of stock.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.433
- What?
- Oh, and Zane just tweeted.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.767
- Ouch. I thought he liked you.
- No, he does.

00:40.833 --> 00:45.433
He's flirt-fighting. My move.
I gotta bite back hard.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.400
- Uh, why is Pearl's
lipstick out?

00:47.467 --> 00:49.700
Wait, why does Pearl
even have a lipstick? Emily?

00:49.767 --> 00:52.567
- This is Pearl II. Gary.

00:52.633 --> 00:56.000
Pearl's son. And lover too,
but that's dogs.

00:56.067 --> 00:57.667
He just peed off
his dog merkin again.

00:57.733 --> 00:59.467
Put on the backup.

00:59.533 --> 01:02.400
It's Velcro, but really
get in there and rub hard.

01:03.733 --> 01:04.933
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.467
You gotta--
you gotta do that.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.867
[Liza gasps]

01:09.067 --> 01:10.633
- Hello.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.400
["Running All Night"
by Zayde Wolf]

01:14.467 --> 01:17.167
- * Oh, everybody thinks *

01:17.233 --> 01:19.767
* That they're gonna rule
the world *

01:19.833 --> 01:23.667
* I'm just gonna learn
how to play it *

01:23.733 --> 01:26.100
* Give me all you got
and I'll turn... *

01:26.167 --> 01:27.800
- Congratulations!

01:27.867 --> 01:30.433
Your Labradoodle book
is starting a trend.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.267
We've been getting submissions
all morning.

01:32.333 --> 01:36.267
Deep thoughts from puppies.
Kittens. Weasels.

01:36.333 --> 01:39.800
- I have three horses,
a gecko, and two hamsters here.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.200
- I had a hamster once
when I was a child.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.933
Sad story. Apparently you can't
blow-dry them on High.

01:45.067 --> 01:47.267
Well, ladies, you've
strapped yourselves to a bomb.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.433
Might as well enjoy the ride.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.067
- Still hard to believe
this is a Millennial title.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.600
A novelty book about
a dog philosopher.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.467
- Kelsey did not want
to publish it. I made her.

01:57.533 --> 02:00.500
- That is going to save
our company.

02:00.567 --> 02:01.833
- What?

02:01.900 --> 02:03.700
- How is it gonna save
our company?

02:03.767 --> 02:06.533
- We're half a million apart
on LL Moore's new contract.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.067
These sales might help
bridge the gap.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.600
- We are happy to go slightly
off-brand for one book

02:12.667 --> 02:14.533
if it's gonna help Empirical.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.367
Nothing we can't walk back
with our next book.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.067
- Walk back?
Run towards it!

02:18.100 --> 02:20.833
Apparently young people
want to read about

02:20.900 --> 02:22.367
what their pets are thinking.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.767
So let's scratch that itch.

02:31.767 --> 02:34.667
- Okay. Got through almost half
the animal kingdom, so--

02:34.733 --> 02:37.500
- Ugh, Richard.
Who says "I love you" in a text?

02:37.567 --> 02:39.167
What am I supposed to say
back to that?

02:39.233 --> 02:42.333
"I know. Thank you."

02:42.400 --> 02:43.933
- That's an option.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.167
- It doesn't cost anything
to be polite, Liza.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.533
Your generation
could learn that.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.067
That reminds me: I have to get
Charles a birthday present.

02:52.067 --> 02:54.067
He always says
mine are his favorite.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.933
Not out loud, but
there's such a thing as subtext.

02:57.067 --> 03:01.600
-Okay, Charles, birthday.
Any ideas?

03:01.667 --> 03:03.400
- Uh, just one.

03:03.467 --> 03:06.633
Have my assistant do it.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.667
Be in my office at noon,
and I want choices.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.400
- * One, two, three, four *

03:12.467 --> 03:16.200
* *

03:16.267 --> 03:18.133
- I thought
we were going to dinner.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.767
- This is me post-Max, okay?

03:20.833 --> 03:23.933
I'm single again
and oozing sex.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.067
I'm not gonna waste that
on a gay waiter.

03:26.133 --> 03:30.100
I'm back, ladies! Yes!
You're welcome!

03:30.167 --> 03:32.200
- [laughs]
- Come on, Maggie.

03:32.267 --> 03:34.133
You need this too, all right?
We'll wing-woman each other.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.800
[phone tweets]

03:35.867 --> 03:38.233
Ugh, Kelsey's got
a Twitter feud going on

03:38.300 --> 03:40.333
with this hot editor
from Rivington.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.800
Let's see: "Millennial Scoops Up
Steaming Hot Property."

03:43.867 --> 03:45.767
- Oh? Ew.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.600
Is that...
- Yeah. Yep. That's dog shit.

03:48.667 --> 03:51.667
Uh-huh, not even the emoji.
Okay, the real thing.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.967
[scoffs] Oh, my God.
Twitter feuds are so lame.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.967
Just go straight
to the hate sex, kiddies.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.733
Less thumbing, more fingering.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.600
- Girl, someone's
looking at you.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.067
- I'm sorry, really?
Where.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.833
- Over there.
- Is she cute?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.333
Ooh, I can't tell. Okay.
She's coming, she's coming.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.200
Look straight, Maggie.
Help me out.

04:06.267 --> 04:08.200
- How do I do that?
- Just look straight.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.067
- Are you...are you
Maggie Amato?

04:10.100 --> 04:11.833
- [laughs] Yeah.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.800
- I saw "The New York Times"
article about you last week.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.333
I love your work.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.733
- That was crazy,
but thank you, thank you.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.700
- Good crazy.

04:18.767 --> 04:22.200
I'm sorry. I'm Donna Malone.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.933
I have a gallery
on Clinton street. Studio 29.

04:25.067 --> 04:27.167
- Oh, yeah, I saw
the Tala Madani show there.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.833
Great space, yeah.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.867
- I can't believe
we've never met.

04:30.933 --> 04:33.167
Maybe I could drop by
your studio?

04:33.233 --> 04:35.400
See your work sometime?
- Any time.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.133
- Great.
- Yeah.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.967
I'm with some friends
and we're about to leave,

04:39.067 --> 04:41.067
but if I give you my card,

04:41.133 --> 04:44.200
would you promise to call me
or text me?

04:44.267 --> 04:45.967
- Absolutely.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.867
Uh, you got a little something
right here.

04:47.933 --> 04:50.867
- Oh, is it--no?
- No, no, no sorry.

04:50.933 --> 04:55.167
- Well, you know, it was
really great meeting you.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.733
- Yeah.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.833
- I'm free tomorrow night,
by the way.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.067
[chuckles]

05:02.133 --> 05:05.533
- Okay.
She was very, very into you.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.933
You coulda
fried an egg on that cooch.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.367
- Did she--did she
have a mustache?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.867
- I don't know, wasn't
on her tits.

05:09.933 --> 05:11.567
Honestly, that's all
I was looking at.

05:11.633 --> 05:13.700
[phone tweets]
Wow!

05:13.767 --> 05:16.333
These two really hate
each other.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.900
I was hoping you were
the pizza guy.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.767
- [chuckles] Right.
Like you eat pizza.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.767
And yes, I see your abs.
You can breathe out now.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.100
- I'm up 250 followers today.

05:29.167 --> 05:32.333
- Ha! I'm up 330.
I'm winning.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.900
- Not really. I'm upping your
stock, not the other way around.

05:35.967 --> 05:38.333
- I see what I'm upping.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.767
Unless that's for the pizza guy.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.200
- * Show me your colors *

05:42.267 --> 05:44.767
* 'Cause there ain't no other *

05:44.833 --> 05:46.267
* Gotta do your own thing *

05:46.333 --> 05:47.767
-  I wish I could have
been there,

05:47.833 --> 05:49.233
but no one wants a mom
on their class trip.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.900
- Anyway, you live here.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.067
You can go to The Whitney
any day of the week.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.900
But I'm beat.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.100
I can't wait to
get on that train and sleep.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.600
- You do look pale.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.933
Are you done with
the antibiotics?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.633
You took the whole bottle,
right?

06:00.700 --> 06:02.133
- You're totally Mom-ing
out on me.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.167
- Well, you had your appendix
out.

06:03.233 --> 06:04.667
That's a major surgery.

06:04.733 --> 06:06.500
- I'm not the walking wounded;
you are.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.633
And you're just avoiding the
topic--the breakup, Josh.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.100
Are you okay?
- Yes.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.400
We're good.
I see him around.

06:13.467 --> 06:16.500
- Was it the age thing?

06:16.567 --> 06:18.433
- Pretty much.
- Figured.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.433
It's too bad.
I liked him.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.100
- So did I.
But we're friends.

06:24.167 --> 06:27.133
- So now you get to be
the older, wiser maternal figure

06:27.200 --> 06:29.867
who listens to his problems
with his new girlfriends.

06:29.933 --> 06:32.100
That sucks.
- What time is your train again?

06:32.167 --> 06:34.467
- Right, um, I should use
the restroom here,

06:34.533 --> 06:36.933
'cause the ones at Grand Central
get too much traffic.

06:37.067 --> 06:40.200
I hate a warm seat.
- Wait, you actually sit down?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.200
Oh, God, I failed you
as a mother.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.333
- [laughs]
Be right back.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.200
And I know exactly
how much chocolate cake is left.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.467
- Liza Miller, right?

06:59.533 --> 07:02.067
Jay... Mallick.
We met at Bonfire?

07:02.100 --> 07:05.867
- Right. Hi, Jay!
From Macmillan. Hi.

07:05.933 --> 07:09.567
- You are embarrassed because
you never called me back.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.600
- Oh, no, yes, maybe.
I don't know.

07:11.667 --> 07:14.400
You know, but I'm happy
at Empirical.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.900
I was just having a bad day
that day that we met.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.800
- Hey, may I?

07:20.333 --> 07:21.833
Um...

07:21.900 --> 07:24.867
[keyboard clacking]

07:24.933 --> 07:26.500
There.
[cell phone ringing]

07:26.567 --> 07:30.067
Now I have your cell.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.700
You know, we don't have to
talk about our jobs.

07:32.767 --> 07:34.700
- Right, I look forward to that.
Thanks. Bye.

07:34.767 --> 07:36.267
- Come on, Mom.
Line was too long.

07:36.333 --> 07:39.067
I'll deal. Did you pay?
- Wait, "Mom"?

07:39.100 --> 07:41.733
- That's her name for me, Mom.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.500
Because I'm always
mothering her.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.933
Wear your scarf,
eat your vegetables.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.133
Oh, how we laugh.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.067
- Yeah.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.867
Okay, I guess she's not
going to introduce me.

07:52.933 --> 07:55.333
I'm the daughter. Caitlin.
- Hi.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.200
- And if we don't get
a move on, Mom,

07:57.267 --> 07:59.067
I'm gonna miss my train.
- [laughs awkwardly]

07:59.100 --> 08:01.600
- I am...confused.
- Oh, geez, gosh.

08:01.667 --> 08:05.233
Look at the time.
You know, it was really nice

08:05.300 --> 08:07.100
seeing you again, Jay.

08:07.167 --> 08:09.100
- Okay, uh, well, yeah.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.267
Well, you know, we should talk.
I'll call you.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.867
- Oh, absolutely, great, yes.

08:13.933 --> 08:16.533
- Okay, nice to see you.
- Great to meet you.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.467
[upbeat music]

08:27.533 --> 08:29.967
-  Okay, tonight at 7:00.

08:30.067 --> 08:33.333
I'll see you then. Bye.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.967
Oh, God.
- What happened?

08:36.067 --> 08:39.867
- I met this Macmillan editor
at Bonfire who thought I was 27.

08:39.933 --> 08:43.067
Well, he ran into me last night
with Caitlin.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.733
And now he wants to talk.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.667
- She blew your cover?
- It was my own fault.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.633
She called me Liza once
when she was 15.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.467
I took away her phone
for a week.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.533
- Wonder what he wants
to talk about.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.067
- He'll tell me at dinner.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.467
- Well, I would show up with
a baseball bat

08:55.533 --> 08:57.467
if things got dicey,
but I'm having

08:57.533 --> 08:59.133
this gallery owner over
tonight.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.533
- Is it a date?
- I'm not really sure.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.300
You know, and she's definitely
interested in my work,

09:03.367 --> 09:06.733
but as far as dating goes,
there's one little problem.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.200
- What is it?

09:08.267 --> 09:09.600
- I think she has a stash.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.067
- Of what?

09:11.100 --> 09:12.533
- No, no, a mustache.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.167
- Everybody's got
a little peach fuzz.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.100
- This is not a peach;
this is a coconut.

09:16.167 --> 09:20.300
- Well, can you look past it?
- How? It's a mustache.

09:20.367 --> 09:23.500
And she keeps it on her face.
- [laughs] You're crazy.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.667
- Besides that, you know,
she's really beautiful.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.533
- Well, maybe it was just
the lighting.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.600
- Yeah. Maybe.

09:33.533 --> 09:39.567
* *

09:41.233 --> 09:42.467
- That's cashmere.

09:42.533 --> 09:45.700
- But brown?
For Charles?

09:47.067 --> 09:48.400
It's really more
Richard's color.

09:48.467 --> 09:49.933
- I'll take it back.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.633
- No, I'll bank it
for Richard's birthday.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.833
Really should find out
when that is.

09:53.900 --> 09:57.167
Oh, this is too feminine
for Charles.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.867
Richard would like it, though.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.133
He's not afraid
of his feminine side.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.933
Which is lucky,
because there's a lot of it.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.600
- What do you think of these
for Richard?

10:09.667 --> 10:10.867
- You mean Charles.

10:10.933 --> 10:12.833
- No, I mean Richard.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.467
Maybe you like him
more than you think.

10:14.533 --> 10:16.300
And maybe you should tell him.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.633
I mean, that's what
all these gifts are saying.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.300
- You're right.

10:23.367 --> 10:25.233
[exhales] It's Richard.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.300
[laughs]

10:27.367 --> 10:29.500
And if it is Richard
and not Charles,

10:29.567 --> 10:31.967
then why the hell am I still
trying to get Charles' approval?

10:32.033 --> 10:33.367
- Well, he is still your boss.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.200
- I have been doing this
for years now.

10:35.267 --> 10:36.600
Look at me!

10:36.667 --> 10:38.167
The hair, the outfit,
the sparkles.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.867
Yes, it is good
for office morale.

10:39.933 --> 10:41.367
- Absolutely.
- But I have been

10:41.433 --> 10:43.167
casting my pearls
before swine.

10:43.233 --> 10:45.033
No more! Mm-mm!

10:45.100 --> 10:47.667
I am turning off the charm,
shutting down this power plant.

10:47.733 --> 10:50.200
And this year, he can get
a goddamn cupcake

10:50.267 --> 10:51.400
like everyone else.

10:51.467 --> 10:56.833
* *

10:56.900 --> 10:58.533
-  Barnes & Noble
sales figures.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.267
- This feud has gone national.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.233
William Shatner
just retweeted me.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.300
- What?
- Verified!

11:03.367 --> 11:04.600
Like, the Priceline guy.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.300
- Yeah, and also "Star Trek."

11:06.367 --> 11:09.367
- And it made Vulture.
Come see this.

11:11.467 --> 11:13.767
- "Millennial Editrix Trashes
New York's

11:13.833 --> 11:16.300
Best Dressed Editor
on Twitter." Wow.

11:16.367 --> 11:19.300
- Best-dressed!
Zane totally fed them this.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.667
- Yeah, business the probably
didn't feed them this part.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.433
It says it all started
because Empirical stole

11:23.500 --> 11:25.067
Lachlan Flynn from him.

11:25.067 --> 11:26.367
Oh, he's not gonna like that,
is it?

11:26.433 --> 11:28.300
- He is not going to care.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.067
It's not fun if it doesn't
hurt a little.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.067
- Really? Is that a rule?
[knock at door]

11:32.133 --> 11:35.700
- FYI, L.L. Moore is giving us
some pushback on our offer.

11:35.767 --> 11:39.367
So that Labradoodle money is
really coming at the right time.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.667
[both chuckle]

11:40.733 --> 11:42.767
- Happy to help.
- And I...

11:42.833 --> 11:45.667
I heard about your Twitter feud.
- Mm-hmm.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.733
- And I have to say,
I think it's unwise,

11:47.800 --> 11:49.233
swapping insults in public.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.067
So I would shut that down
if I were you.

11:52.100 --> 11:55.267
- But it's boosting our profile
and sales.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.233
I mean, didn't you
just help yourself

11:57.300 --> 11:59.500
to some of our profits
for Empirical?

12:05.800 --> 12:07.233
- So I did.

12:15.867 --> 12:18.067
- Kels, Charles thinks
this is getting out of hand.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.500
- Of course he does.
He's old-school.

12:19.567 --> 12:20.733
[phone tweets]

12:20.800 --> 12:23.533
J.K. Rowling retweeted me!

12:23.600 --> 12:25.100
That's crazy.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.233
[laughs]

12:27.300 --> 12:34.267
* *

12:36.800 --> 12:39.100
- You know, I'd love
to see this in the light.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.167
- Uh, yeah.

12:41.233 --> 12:44.100
I keep more in storage.
I have smaller ones hair.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.300
I mean, here.
Smaller ones here.

12:46.367 --> 12:49.967
- Mm, oh, and this!
I mean, this is....

12:50.067 --> 12:52.300
Just...mm!

12:52.367 --> 12:54.500
Mm. I mean, that's amazing.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.733
- [chuckles nervously]
- She paints, she cooks.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.367
[chuckles] Mm!

13:00.433 --> 13:02.933
Can we speak honestly?

13:03.067 --> 13:04.533
- Oh, thank God.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.200
- I love your art.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.700
And I'm going to hang it

13:07.767 --> 13:09.700
no matter how you feel
about this.

13:09.767 --> 13:14.067
But I'm also really
interested in you.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.500
As a person.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.067
As a woman.

13:18.133 --> 13:20.367
- You just get right
to the point, don't you?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.867
- Well, you know, I like
to just jump right in there.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.667
I like to ask a girl
what she likes,

13:24.733 --> 13:28.567
and you know, if I like it too,
well, then...

13:28.633 --> 13:30.700
[laughs]
Okay, okay.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.467
- Yeah.
- I'll go first.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.233
I love romance.

13:34.300 --> 13:35.800
Kissing, cuddling.

13:35.867 --> 13:38.567
Bubble baths.
I love bathing together.

13:38.633 --> 13:41.567
Hey. Do you have a bathtub?

13:41.633 --> 13:44.400
- I do.
- Mm, warm water.

13:44.467 --> 13:48.067
Lights out,
just like a dozen candles.

13:48.067 --> 13:49.533
- How 'bout two?

13:49.600 --> 13:50.667
[both laugh]

13:50.733 --> 13:51.900
Or one.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.833
- All right.
- Yeah.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.533
- So yeah, 41.
Class of '96.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.567
- Well, here's to you.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.933
- Don't congratulate me.
It was a mistake.

14:05.067 --> 14:09.100
People find out
and then it's...leverage.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.467
- What do you mean?
- I've been pressured before.

14:11.533 --> 14:13.233
Blackmailed.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.267
- Oh, my God. What kind of crowd
are you running with?

14:16.333 --> 14:18.967
Oh, publishing, right, yeah.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.700
All right, well, look,
I won't tell anyone.

14:22.767 --> 14:25.667
- As long as I...
- Nothing. No.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.733
You don't even have to be
nice to me, all right?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.300
You can get up, throw a glass
of win in my face and leave,

14:30.367 --> 14:32.133
and I will not tell a soul.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.767
I'll eat your entrée,
but I will keep your secret.

14:37.067 --> 14:40.433
Hey, look.
I'm one of the good guys.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.933
In fact, the only thing
bad about me

14:42.067 --> 14:43.333
is that I walk around
saying things like,

14:43.400 --> 14:46.767
"I'm one of the good guys."
I'm sorry.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.967
- Well, thank you.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.967
I gotta be honest,
it's been a strain.

14:52.067 --> 14:55.067
A part of me just wants to tell
everybody and end the suspense.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.900
- No, no, no, no, no,
don't do that.

14:56.967 --> 14:58.800
Especially don't tell
your bosses.

14:58.867 --> 15:01.967
It'll be a scandal.
Look, keep your secret.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.133
And if you ever wanna talk
to somebody who grew up

15:04.200 --> 15:07.700
watching the same TV shows
as you did, call me.

15:07.767 --> 15:09.833
- "Who's the Boss."
- Mm-hmm.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.667
- I had a Danza thing.
Not entirely gone.

15:13.733 --> 15:16.133
- Yeah, "Miami Vice.
Every episode.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.500
Wore a pink blazer
in junior high.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.467
[both chuckle]

15:23.900 --> 15:25.833
What?

15:25.900 --> 15:28.367
- Oh, I, um, I just remembered
who else went to Princeton.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.667
My boss.

15:30.733 --> 15:32.600
- Oh, right, yeah.
Charles Brooks.

15:32.667 --> 15:33.933
"Upchuck" we used to call him

15:34.067 --> 15:35.367
'cause he couldn't hold
his booze.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.067
- Seriously?
You were in school together?

15:37.067 --> 15:38.333
- Yeah, we were
in the [indistinct] club.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.933
Charles!
- What are you doing?

15:41.067 --> 15:42.467
- This'll be good. Watch.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.500
- Can you give me one second?

15:45.567 --> 15:47.067
- Hey, buddy.

15:47.067 --> 15:49.700
- Hey, Jay.
- What's up, Upchuck?

15:49.767 --> 15:51.667
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.267
- Liza.
- Hi.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.933
- Hi.
- Liza and I met at Bonfire.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.467
You know, Millennial is creating

15:58.533 --> 16:00.433
a lot of good buzz
for Empirical.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.133
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
her team is doing great things.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.433
Proud of them.
- Fostering young talent.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.600
Proud of you.
Congratulations.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.267
And by the way, she's not
consorting with the enemy,

16:09.333 --> 16:11.200
if that's what you were
thinking.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.767
This is strictly social
Business has not even come up.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.267
- Okay.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.933
- I would ask you to stay,
but...

16:17.067 --> 16:18.400
- No, no, that's fine.

16:18.467 --> 16:19.667
I'm meeting Bill Merriman
from Penguin.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.133
- Ah. Great.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.600
Good to see you.
- Enjoy your evening.

16:22.667 --> 16:23.667
Good to see you.
Enjoy your evening.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.133
- All right.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.567
- Liza.

16:30.433 --> 16:33.267
- Now last time he saw me,

16:33.333 --> 16:36.067
I was dating
a much younger woman.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.667
This confirms your story.

16:37.733 --> 16:40.267
See, I'm good for you.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.467
- [chuckles]
- Now "Who's the Boss."

16:42.533 --> 16:43.800
Remind me, is that the one

16:43.867 --> 16:47.367
with the employee/boss
love story?

16:47.433 --> 16:51.467
- Yeah.
Yeah, something like that.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.133
- Tony Danza. One of our finest
American actors.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.400
"Golden Girls."

16:56.467 --> 17:00.767
- * Run with me,
let's run, run *

17:06.067 --> 17:08.067
[upbeat music]

17:08.067 --> 17:10.167
- Oh, isn't this nice?

17:10.233 --> 17:11.667
I feel so warm and fuzzy.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.667
- I'm not surprised.
I mean, me too.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.133
[both chuckling]

17:17.200 --> 17:18.600
- [moans]

17:20.500 --> 17:21.800
- [laughs nervously]

17:21.867 --> 17:23.333
- Are you feeling
what I'm feeling?

17:23.400 --> 17:26.467
- Uh-huh. Plus a little
something extra.

17:26.533 --> 17:28.100
- [laughs]

17:28.167 --> 17:31.533
can I ask you to do something
kind of intimate?

17:31.600 --> 17:33.433
- Considering
where your foot is,

17:33.500 --> 17:35.900
I pretty sure we're past that.

17:36.933 --> 17:39.867
- Will you...
shave me?

17:39.933 --> 17:41.933
- [laughs] Ohh.

17:45.067 --> 17:48.300
I have literally
not thought of anything else

17:48.367 --> 17:50.300
since the moment we met.

17:50.367 --> 17:52.067
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:52.133 --> 17:54.600
[both chuckling]

17:55.633 --> 17:57.500
- Wait, wait.
What are you doing?

17:57.567 --> 17:59.100
- I'm shaving you.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.133
- I meant my pussy!

18:08.800 --> 18:10.833
- * Ain't nothin' new,
been there, done that *

18:10.900 --> 18:13.367
- That was great,
just so you know.

18:13.433 --> 18:17.067
- I do know.
I was there.

18:17.133 --> 18:18.533
Were you?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.467
This is time stamped
two minutes ago.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.933
How are you DM'ing me while
we were actually having sex?

18:23.067 --> 18:25.267
- I had a hand free.
Remember?

18:25.333 --> 18:27.833
- Okay, that's it.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.067
Let's talk.
Or not talk. I don't care.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.600
But I'm sleeping with you
tonight and not your phone.

18:34.667 --> 18:37.500
- I'll get us some more wine

18:37.567 --> 18:40.333
and I'll leave these
in the kitchen.

18:46.967 --> 18:48.600
[text tone chimes]

18:56.400 --> 18:58.900
- You know what?

18:58.967 --> 19:01.667
I think we should actually
stop the Twitter feud.

19:01.733 --> 19:03.667
My boss isn't crazy about it,

19:03.733 --> 19:06.100
and I kinda owe him everything.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.433
- Fine.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.500
Actually, this is
perfect time for a truce.

19:14.933 --> 19:16.333
We're even.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.333
- * Give me some of that,
give me some of that gold *

19:21.400 --> 19:24.733
* Give me some of that,
give me some of that gold *

19:24.800 --> 19:28.233
* Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
whoa-oh-oh *

19:28.300 --> 19:30.400
- Hey, happy birthday.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.433
- Thanks.
Not a big birthday guy.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.200
- I, uh, I should have sent
a cake or something

19:35.267 --> 19:37.433
over to your table last night.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.233
- Jay Mallick, huh?

19:39.300 --> 19:41.433
He's a nice guy.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.067
Never married.

19:43.133 --> 19:46.300
Likes cats.
He's a cat guy.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.067
- News alert
from Publishers Lunch:

19:50.133 --> 19:52.100
L.L. Moore just signed
with Rivington!

19:52.167 --> 19:53.600
- What?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.867
- Rivington just stole
L.L. Moore!

19:55.933 --> 19:58.067
- How did this happen?!

19:58.067 --> 20:01.000
Is this because of your feud
with that Rivington editor?

20:01.067 --> 20:02.867
- Well, it's not a real feud,
it's...

20:02.933 --> 20:05.267
- No, he's my friend.
Zane is my friend.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.967
We're more than friends.
We're dating.

20:07.033 --> 20:09.100
He would never do that.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.967
- Oh, pillow talk.
It can bring down empires.

20:11.033 --> 20:12.667
Once at Harper Collins, I was--

20:12.733 --> 20:16.700
- Did you let any
proprietary information slip?

20:18.300 --> 20:21.100
Our latest offer?
- No. No.

20:21.167 --> 20:24.400
- He didn't have access
to your phone? Your iPad?

20:26.033 --> 20:27.433
No? Yes?

20:31.600 --> 20:35.400
This is bad, Kelsey.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.467
Disappointing.

20:40.533 --> 20:44.267
And bad.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.067
For all of us.

20:46.133 --> 20:48.867
- * Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

20:48.933 --> 20:50.733
- [sighs]
Poor Charles.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.333
On his birthday too.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.600
Really, Kelsey?

20:54.667 --> 20:56.733
- * Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

20:56.800 --> 20:58.900
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

20:58.967 --> 21:03.600
* Shadows *

21:03.667 --> 21:06.400
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

21:06.467 --> 21:08.433
- [sighs]

21:12.300 --> 21:15.367
[upbeat music]

21:15.433 --> 21:17.500
- Zane, are you kidding me?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.067
I could lose my job.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.667
This is not a game.
This is my life.

21:21.733 --> 21:24.900
Oh, never mind.
Don't call me.

21:24.967 --> 21:27.833
- Kelsey, if he did this to you,
he is not worth crying over.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.100
- I-I'm crying over my job.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.700
Did you see Charles?
He's going to fire me.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.567
And even if he doesn't,
he's never gonna trust me again!

21:34.633 --> 21:36.600
- Yes, he will.
He cares about you.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.933
- And this is how I repay him,
by taking my eye off the ball,

21:40.067 --> 21:43.167
by getting swept up
in some stupid...

21:43.233 --> 21:46.267
[phone chiming]

21:47.233 --> 21:49.600
God, leave me alone.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.433
Liza, I'm sorry.
You too.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.067
I need a moment, okay?
- Okay.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.267
[sobs]

22:05.733 --> 22:07.700
- How could you
accuse her like that?

22:07.767 --> 22:10.067
This is not her fault.
- You sure of that? She isn't.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.367
- Charles, she is
in there crying.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.200
She's afraid
you're gonna fire her!

22:13.267 --> 22:15.667
- Good. Then she won't
be surprised if it happens.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.500
What am I supposed to do, Liza?

22:17.567 --> 22:19.900
You of all people know
how important

22:19.967 --> 22:21.567
LL Moore is
to this company.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.733
- People are important too.
- Yeah, exactly.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.867
And I've got 75 people
out there

22:26.933 --> 22:29.300
whose jobs I suddenly
can't guarantee

22:29.367 --> 22:31.100
because of her
carelessness!

22:31.167 --> 22:33.300
- This is not like you
to be so angry

22:33.367 --> 22:35.167
before you know the facts.
- You're right.

22:35.233 --> 22:37.367
You're right. You're right.
I don't know anything.

22:37.433 --> 22:39.400
I don't know how I'm going to
replace our biggest earner!

22:39.467 --> 22:41.100
I don't know how I'm going to
make payroll next month!

22:41.167 --> 22:42.867
And I don't know why
you're dating

22:42.933 --> 22:46.100
a 40-something guy
in publishing who isn't me!

22:46.167 --> 22:50.367
all: * Happy birthday to you *

22:50.433 --> 22:53.833
* Happy birthday to you *

22:53.900 --> 22:58.567
* Happy birthday dear Charles *

22:58.633 --> 23:03.400
* Happy birthday to you *

23:05.800 --> 23:07.467
Blow, Charles.

23:08.833 --> 23:10.467
Or I will.

23:14.433 --> 23:16.467
Yes!

23:19.700 --> 23:21.900
- * You will come for me *

23:27.067 --> 23:29.967
[upbeat music]

23:30.067 --> 23:37.067
