<i>- ( Squeals )</i>

00:07.508 --> 00:08.774
What are we watching?

00:08.776 --> 00:11.243
Fashion week?
Music videos?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.112
Oh...

00:13.114 --> 00:13.787
Basketball.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.783
I know it looks like
we must be identical twins,

00:17.785 --> 00:20.586
but sometimes
I seriously question it.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.521
Yeah, I'm studying
the game tape

00:22.523 --> 00:24.523
for our school rivals,
the Ravens.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.991
They wiped the floor
with us last year.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.292
It was the first game
I ever started

00:27.294 --> 00:28.794
and I scored seven points.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.797
Oh! Seven points.
Yay.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.965
Not yay.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.868
It was humiliating.
It was a career low.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.770
But I've been
working my butt off

00:37.772 --> 00:39.838
and this Friday,
Maddie Rooney is gonna

00:39.840 --> 00:41.306
pluck those Ravens!

00:41.308 --> 00:43.776
Boom! What?!

00:43.778 --> 00:45.010
I don't hear game tape.

00:45.012 --> 00:48.047
( Gasps ) Why aren't you
watching the Ravens?

00:48.049 --> 00:49.782
You gotta get ready.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.684
Now let me see that rage face.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.921
Rage face!

00:55.923 --> 00:57.790
It's like I live
with a family of bears.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.859
That's what I'm looking for.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.661
Get back to your game tape.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.196
Oh, could you do me a favor?

01:04.198 --> 01:07.232
Don't tell your mother
I'm fanning the flames
of your fury.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.333
( Clicks tongue )

01:08.335 --> 01:11.303
"Fanning the flames
of your fury,"

01:11.305 --> 01:13.572
and somehow
I'm the dramatic one.

01:13.574 --> 01:18.110
- <i>( Crickets chirping )</i>
<i>- Maddie, you're still</i>
<i>hogging the TV?</i>

01:18.112 --> 01:22.681
It's not normal for kids
to be playing outside this much.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.785
How about you
pause-a-rooski
that video

01:26.787 --> 01:28.053
and come to the mall with me

01:28.055 --> 01:29.888
for a sister-centric
shopping fest?

01:29.890 --> 01:32.291
Oh, Liv, I would so love
to go to the mall with you,

01:32.293 --> 01:34.093
except I hate the mall
and I'm busy.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.597
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather have some Liv time?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.599
You know,
they say it's good for the soul.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.335
Yeah, there's been
a lot of Liv time

01:43.337 --> 01:45.070
since you moved home,
and it's been great.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.738
But now I have
basketball season

01:46.740 --> 01:48.140
and midterms,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.109
and I can't just
pause-a-rooski my life

01:50.111 --> 01:51.844
to hang out with you 24/7.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.812
I think maybe it's time
for you to find a friend.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.049
Okay.

01:57.051 --> 01:58.851
What are you doing?

01:58.853 --> 02:02.154
That truth bomb just
blew up in my face.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.355
What's the problem?

02:03.357 --> 02:04.990
I mean, I'm sure
a lot of kids at school

02:04.992 --> 02:07.092
want to be your friend.
You're Liv Rooney.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.128
Yeah, and people
are really nice,

02:09.130 --> 02:10.863
but then they want an autograph

02:10.865 --> 02:11.997
or for me
to reenact scenes from

02:11.999 --> 02:14.066
¶ sing it loud!

02:15.401 --> 02:17.369
Which I don't mind doing.

02:18.838 --> 02:19.972
( Gasps )

02:19.974 --> 02:21.807
Do you want to hear a scene?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.275
Seriously people,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.711
it's getting dark outside.

Liv, Maddie told me
what you're up to.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.339
How's "find a new
friend" day going?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.741
Mom, don't name days like that.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.076
I thought we discussed this

03:31.078 --> 03:33.312
on "it's just a pimple,
you're going to school" day.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.479
( Chuckles )

03:34.481 --> 03:36.014
I remember that chat.

03:36.016 --> 03:39.718
It was on "I'm your mom,
now do what I say" day.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.322
My mom chats with me at
my locker every morning.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.856
( Gasps )

03:44.858 --> 03:46.024
I think I just
cracked the mystery

03:46.026 --> 03:47.226
of why I have no friends.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.295
Remember, never judge a book

03:50.297 --> 03:51.830
by his or her cover...

03:51.832 --> 03:54.032
Except those kids
who hang out by
the dumpsters.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.034

are bad news.

will you sign this?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.472
Oh, sorry.

meatless mondays

I love your backpack.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.405
Oh thanks.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.440
I made it myself
from my old jeans.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.042
I'm into up-cycling.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.143
Wow.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.045
You are positively
perk-a-licious.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.414
I live on a sunflower farm.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.818
If those little seeds
can spring out of the earth

04:46.820 --> 04:48.353
and find the sun,

04:48.355 --> 04:50.255
why can't I?

04:51.257 --> 04:52.457
Do you want to do
something later?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.192
( Groans )

04:55.361 --> 04:56.561
I can't.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.096
See, I have spirit club,

04:58.098 --> 04:59.498
archery lessons,
oh, and my blog...

04:59.500 --> 05:01.266
"Happiest teen

05:05.572 --> 05:06.872
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.111
- Check it out...
The z-phone 620q.
- ( Beeping )

05:13.113 --> 05:16.181
The most advanced
smart phone on the planet.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.550
I have not set it down
since I got it.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.219
Seriously Parker,
can you take it out of my hand?

05:21.221 --> 05:22.554
It's cramping.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.425
That is long enough.
That is long enough.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.163
I hadn't seen Joey this excited
since we got our pet hamster,

05:31.165 --> 05:32.431
Templeton.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.166
He wouldn't let that
out of his hand either.

05:34.168 --> 05:37.235
Hope we won't have
to bury that phone
in the backyard, too.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.973
Oh, Joey.
Quit showing off your new toy.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.308

05:43.310 --> 05:47.112
The z-phone 620q
is not a toy, mother.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.847
Well, I'm very glad
to hear you say that

05:48.849 --> 05:50.349
because it was not cheap.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.451
I haven't forgotten.
I'm gonna pay you back.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.853
That's why I got this
cruddy mall food court job.

05:54.855 --> 05:55.987
A job you're gonna be late for,

05:55.989 --> 05:57.255
so come on.
It's time to go.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.524
Ask me what I did today.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.992
No, don't.
I need to blurt.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.494
I made a friend.
Oh wow!

06:35.496 --> 06:39.464
She doesn't even care that
I'm the famous Liv Rooney.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.433
Yay.
She likes me for me.

06:41.435 --> 06:45.504
And see? That was
not nearly as hard as you
thought it was gonna be.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.506
I have to admit,
you were right.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.107
Well, thank you.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.475
Aren't her backpacks
so cool too?

06:50.477 --> 06:52.577
So cool! She even said
she was gonna make me one

06:52.579 --> 06:53.979
out of her mom's
old bellbottoms.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.647
Wait, what?

06:55.649 --> 06:58.250
I never said anything
about backpacks.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.386
How'd you know it was ocean?

07:01.388 --> 07:04.489
Look.
Pretty lights.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.659
Maddie.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.394
My twinstincts are telling me

07:09.396 --> 07:10.517
that you're up to something.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.466
Fine.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.401
Do you remember
how you were saying

07:16.403 --> 07:18.136
that it's really hard
for you to make new friends

07:18.138 --> 07:19.538
everyone knows who you are?

07:21.207 --> 07:22.507
Well, I sort of found
the only girl in school

07:22.509 --> 07:23.675
who's family doesn't have a TV

07:23.677 --> 07:25.610
and sort of sent her your way?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.312
You sent ocean to me?

07:27.314 --> 07:28.980
I can't believe this.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.017
You totally
friend-dipulated
the situation!

07:32.019 --> 07:34.019
Well Liv, I just thought
you needed some help.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.654
And I thought that
ocean liked me for me,

07:35.656 --> 07:37.189
but now I guess
we'll never know,

07:37.191 --> 07:38.457
because you think
I'm so pathetic

07:38.459 --> 07:40.325
you had to go and
set the whole thing up.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.493
You just wanted
to get rid of me.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.195
Liv, that's not true.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.330
You were out friend shopping
and I just made it easier.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.033
I brought
the friend store to you.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.036
Do not distract me
with shopping metaphors!

07:57.677 --> 08:00.745
Uh, chambers,
the muck bucket
out back is full.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.515
What do you want me to do with
this disgusting veggie muck?

08:03.517 --> 08:05.383
Whoa whoa whoa.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.385
What kind of an
attitude is that?

08:07.387 --> 08:09.521
Muck is the lifeblood
of the happy carrot.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.590
You are holding
orange gold, sir.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.493
Yeah, I just want to know
where to put the bucket.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.329
Joey, do you have any idea

08:17.331 --> 08:19.364
how lucky you are to be here?

08:19.366 --> 08:21.233
The fastest growing
carrot-based franchise

08:21.235 --> 08:26.671
How many carrot based
franchises are there
in Wisconsin?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.273
Logic kills, Joey.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.611
Come on, you and me are
riding the beta-carotene wave.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.212
Oh, that is great.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.715
So... bucket?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.216
Yeah, just pour it
down the drain.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.751
That stuff starts to
smell really fast.

08:39.753 --> 08:43.221
Probably not supposed
to say this to my boss,

08:43.223 --> 08:46.424
but I really hate this job.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.760
( Laughing )

08:48.762 --> 08:50.729
I love this guy.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.665
And I've got something
that's gonna turn that
'tude right around.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.634
Ka-ching!
Your first paycheck.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.668
Sweet.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.436
I gotta get
a z-pic of this.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.814
At that rate it was
gonna take seven months

09:09.816 --> 09:11.349
to pay off my z-phone.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.551
I did the math in my head,

09:12.553 --> 09:14.352
and by head I mean phone.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.755
One of these days,
that will be the same thing.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.093
Oh hey!
Liv Rooney,
Liv Rooney!

09:22.095 --> 09:23.428
Liv Rooney.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.498
( Stammering ) Liv Rooney?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.534
Good news.
Meatless Monday
is official.

09:29.536 --> 09:33.338
Big smiley faces
when I told all the cows
in my barn this morning.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.674
Okay, so are we
still on for later?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.209
Um...

09:38.211 --> 09:40.145
Thanks but no thanks, ocean.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.347
Maddie told me that
she set this whole
thing up,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.149
so you don't have to
pretend to like me anymore.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.117
Oh my oatmeal.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.719
Liv Rooney, Liv Rooney,
Liv Rooney Rooney Rooney.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.487
It's not like that, okay?

09:49.489 --> 09:51.256
I mean sure it was
Maddie's idea,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.525
but people can become
friends in all different ways.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.727
Sorry, ocean.
I don't need a pity friend.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.098
I was going to make
my own friends.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.366
I didn't need Maddie's
help to do that.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.302
I didn't need Maddie's
help to do anything.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.504
Well, occasionally she pops
a back zit for me,

10:06.506 --> 10:07.572
but that's it.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.579
You look interesting.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.181
I'm Liv.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.249
Congratulations.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.287
Ooh.
Careful.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.529
Don't want to dent your locker.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.224
It's not my locker.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.692
I just don't like to litter.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.162
See you.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.366
Um...

10:34.368 --> 10:36.234
I didn't catch your name.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.703
That's okay.
We can do that later.

10:38.705 --> 10:42.707
- Did I just see you
talking to Kylie Kramer?
- Oh! That's her name.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.343
Liv, stay away from her.
She's really bad news.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.213
Why, because you didn't
pick her for me?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.381
I'm serious.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.749
She's really big trouble.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.518
I mean, this girl's
been kicked out of
three schools.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.687
One of them was online.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.489
Ooh, I wear black.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.556
I switched schools.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.759
I must be a bad girl.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.560
I get it.
You're angry with me

11:02.562 --> 11:03.895
and you want to
pick your own friends.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.264
Just please don't pick Kylie.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.434
Oh, so now I have to
run all my friendship
choices by you?

11:09.436 --> 11:10.702
I like Kylie.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.537
So don't be dissing
on my kay-kay.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.905
Fine.
But don't be surprised

11:13.907 --> 11:15.774
when your kay-kay
turns out to be cray-cray.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.875
( Groans )

11:16.877 --> 11:18.643
<i>( School bell rings )</i>

11:19.712 --> 11:20.779
Hey, kay-kay.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.747
Yeah, that's not happening.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.449
Got it.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.252
So my sister says
you're kind of a
bad girl?

11:27.254 --> 11:29.254
Yeah, I got in trouble
at my old school,

11:29.256 --> 11:31.289
but I'm a totally
different person now.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.224
Oh, you turned over a new leaf?

11:33.226 --> 11:34.359
No, I got a new I.D.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.227
I'm literally
a different person.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.631
I'm ditching
the last two periods.
Want to come?

11:39.633 --> 11:42.200
You mean like...
Skip class?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.369
I've never done this before.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.371
I mean, even on my show,

11:46.373 --> 11:48.540
I was a good girl.
I had other issues,

11:48.542 --> 11:51.843
- like I was a down-on-
her-luck rich girl...
- Boring!

11:51.845 --> 11:53.378
I'm going to the mall.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.846
The mall?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.448
Is this a sign or what?

11:56.882 --> 11:57.616
I cut school

11:57.617 --> 12:01.453
and was outside
without any sunscreen.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.388
Can you say
"living on the edge"?

12:06.992 --> 12:09.627
<i>( School bell rings )</i>

12:09.629 --> 12:11.596
Oh, hey Maddie.
Good luck on the
game tonight.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.631
Boo Ravens!

12:15.901 --> 12:17.936
That's your first time
cheering for sports,
isn't it?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.604
Yeah. That's the voice
I normally use

12:19.606 --> 12:20.872
to get the chickens
back in their Coop.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.408
You know, "go chickens!"

12:24.744 --> 12:26.678
Oh, by the way.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.881
It doesn't look like
it's gonna work out
with me and Liv.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.815
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.551
I so thought it was gonna
work out with you guys.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.687
I mean, you're a Wisconsin
farm girl,

12:35.689 --> 12:38.857
she's a Hollywood TV actress.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.392
Yeah, why did I think it was
gonna work out with you guys?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.027
No worries, Maddie Rooney.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.829
Oh, can you give these
class notes to her?

12:44.831 --> 12:46.498
I noticed she wasn't in German.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.434
Tell her it was totally...
( Speaks German )

12:49.436 --> 12:51.970
That means "awesome."
( Chuckles )

12:51.972 --> 12:54.572
Wait, Liv wasn't in German?

12:54.574 --> 12:55.807
Was she sick?

12:55.809 --> 12:58.276
I heard she ditched
school to go to the mall.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.345
Why would Liv ditch?

13:00.347 --> 13:03.014
( Gasps ) Kylie.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.821
Hey, jojo.
Tell me what you know-know.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.358
Okay listen, chambers,
I need a promotion.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.493
I am not making enough money
to pay off my phone

13:15.495 --> 13:19.330
and I smell like
a rotting vegetable.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.299
All right, buddy.
So sell me.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.867
Next step up is counter man.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.969
Why should I make you
the bright smiling face

13:24.971 --> 13:26.504
of the happy carrot?

13:26.506 --> 13:31.009
Because it pays
50 cents more an hour.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.045
That's the spark
I've been looking for.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.581
The job is yours, my man.
You start immediately.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.353
Back to muck land, Rodney.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.755
You really should
have smiled more.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.528
A carrot cape.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.363
With great responsibility

13:52.365 --> 13:54.632
comes awesome accessories.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.703
I was the proud owner
of a z-phone 620q

13:58.705 --> 14:01.773
and I was getting paid
to wear a cape.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.575
Could life get any better?

14:03.577 --> 14:05.109
I know that sounds
like a question,

14:05.111 --> 14:06.711
but it is a statement.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.782
( Deep voice ) May I help you?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.918
Question.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.387
Why does my teenage brother
sleep in a cape?

14:16.389 --> 14:20.124
Because he can no longer
fit in his racecar bed.

14:25.764 --> 14:27.799
I thought we were here
to have some real fun.

14:27.801 --> 14:30.034
And all you want to do
is look at clothes.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.105
Well I thought we'd
become lifelong friends
while trying on sweaters.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.040
Seriously?

14:38.377 --> 14:40.478
Hey, how about we get
your nose pierced like mine?

14:40.480 --> 14:44.082
Yeah, as an actress
I can't really punch
holes in my face.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.052
Oh!
Classic aviators.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.921
Jet-tastic.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.890
More shopping?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.725
Okay, grumpy pants.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.460
Why don't we go
grab you a snack?

14:58.864 --> 14:59.898
Hey, Liv.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.966
Here.

15:01.968 --> 15:02.967
Ooh.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.435
You bought these?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.070
Nope.
I stole them.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.171
What?!

15:07.173 --> 15:08.840
Hey, girls!
Get back here!

15:08.842 --> 15:09.974
- <i>( Alarm blaring )</i>
<i>- Run!</i>

15:12.111 --> 15:13.711
Liv!

15:13.713 --> 15:15.179
You dropped your sunglasses.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.481
That's her.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.082
She's the one that took them.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.084
Wait, these are stolen?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.653
Well, that wasn't me.

15:21.655 --> 15:22.820
Save it, blondie.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.889
I never forget a face.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.925
( Sighs ) I so hate the mall.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.033
Shoplifting?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.668
What were you thinking?

15:36.670 --> 15:40.138
I was thinking that if Liv
got busted for shoplifting

15:40.140 --> 15:42.573
every single gossip blog
in the country

15:42.575 --> 15:43.975
would spin it out of control

15:43.977 --> 15:45.710
and trash her...

15:45.712 --> 15:47.845
And that I really wish I'd
stopped by the pretzel cart

15:47.847 --> 15:48.913
before I got popped.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.182
Just because security
let you go

15:51.184 --> 15:52.917
does not mean
you're off the hook.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.786
This calls for
a big punishment.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.555
Maddie, we are taking away
your cellphone for a month.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.190
You do that all the time.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.794
That's like the meatloaf
of punishments.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.729
Dude.
Mind your own meatloaf.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.898
Little guy's right.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.900
It's gotta be something
that really matters.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.803
We need the filet mignon
of punishments.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.204
Okay.

16:13.206 --> 16:17.241
you are benched
from tonight's game
against the Ravens.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.876
Are you serious?!

16:18.878 --> 16:20.578
What?!

16:20.580 --> 16:23.481
Brutal.
You just got mommed!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.049
Sweetie,

16:25.051 --> 16:27.185
you can't bench my star player

16:27.187 --> 16:28.987
for the Ravens game.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.188
Ground her.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.923
Take her computer away.

16:31.925 --> 16:34.258
Take her glasses away.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.861
This is your fault.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.997
You got her so worked up
about this Ravens game

16:38.999 --> 16:40.198
and she acted out.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.733
Fine.
Bench me then.

16:41.735 --> 16:42.800
Let her play.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.169
Maddie, you are benched.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.605
- But, mom!
- End of conversation.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.940
( Groans )

16:48.942 --> 16:51.809
I just don't know
what got into you.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.212
Neither do I.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.947
I intend to find out.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.987
Number nine?
Your tempeh of doom is ready.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.956
Number nine, are you there?

17:04.958 --> 17:06.190
Is... did they leave?
They left.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.792
Oh.
Thank you.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.828
Nailed that.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.864
Joey, we're slammed.
Help me make the garden wraps.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.532
What? No no,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.968
I'm the counter guy.
I am not ready to wrap!

17:16.970 --> 17:18.936
Dinner rush is where
stars are made, my friend.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.004
Now pay attention.
It goes...

17:20.006 --> 17:21.873
Tortilla, hummus, tzicki,

17:21.875 --> 17:23.741
tahini, cucumber,
lettuce, tomato.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.942
Say it with me.

17:24.944 --> 17:29.080
- tahini...
- Hang on, let me
put it in my phone.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.882
No, there's no time for that.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.017
You put the phone down
and you pull up those
big boy pants.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.218
( Typing on phone )

17:34.220 --> 17:36.220
Oh, this is too much pressure!

17:36.222 --> 17:38.689
My heart rate is 145.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.099
Oh good.
I'm so glad you're home.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.934
I have been dying
to talk to you.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.736
You were so right.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.937
Kylie is bad news.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.273
That's funny,
coming from a shoplifter.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.607
What?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.076
- I didn't...
- Liv, I was there.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.977
You stole sunglasses.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.080
Pause the news feed.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.682
Maddie, I didn't
steal anything.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.017
I mean, Kylie stuck
those shades in my hand.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.952
I dropped them and I bolted.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.922
that was engraving
our names on a penny.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.091
Wait, you didn't steal them?

18:13.093 --> 18:15.626
Liv, I...
I took the blame for you.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.029
What? Why?

18:18.031 --> 18:19.330
Because...

18:19.332 --> 18:21.199
( Groans )

18:21.201 --> 18:23.034
If I hadn't,

18:23.036 --> 18:24.168
that security guard
would have caught you,

18:24.170 --> 18:27.905
quicker than that picture of
a duckling cuddling a kitten.

18:27.907 --> 18:31.609
( Giggles )
It was the cutest
thing I'd ever seen.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.144
- ( Quacks )
- ( Meows )

18:35.881 --> 18:37.882
But that's not what
we're talking about
right now.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.851
No, it's not.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.753
Liv, you are so lucky
I was there for you...

18:42.755 --> 18:46.891
Maddie, I know you think
it's your job to protect me,

18:46.893 --> 18:48.893
but you've got to stop.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.229
I mean, you tried
to make ocean my friend,

18:51.231 --> 18:52.763
you tried to
protect me from Kylie,

18:52.765 --> 18:56.901
Now just because you were
right in every single one
of those instances

18:56.903 --> 18:59.637
does not mean you know
what's best for me.

19:00.372 --> 19:01.839
( Sighs )

19:01.841 --> 19:03.708
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

19:03.710 --> 19:06.177
mom benched me from
the Ravens game tonight.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.713
What?
She benched you?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.648
Wait, what does
"benched" mean again?

19:11.750 --> 19:12.950
It means I'm not
allowed to play.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.218
That's what I thought.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.955
because this game is way
too important to you.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.828
By the way,
there is a pretzel from
the mall on your desk.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.162
It seemed more generous
at the time.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.234
Well, you survived your
first dinner rush, my man.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.903
You made the carrot proud.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.438
What do you say we scrub up
and head over to the carousel?

19:34.440 --> 19:35.973
It's a great way to end the day

19:35.975 --> 19:37.975
and to meet single moms.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.911
Thanks, but I've already got

19:39.913 --> 19:41.345
one more mom than
I really need.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.850
I will just grab
my phone and get
out of here.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.452
( Chuckles )

19:48.454 --> 19:50.788
Where did that
little stinker go?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.958
I'll just use
the landline
to call it.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.893
( Dialing )

19:58.163 --> 20:01.132
<i>( Cellphone ringing )</i>

20:01.134 --> 20:03.000
No!

20:06.838 --> 20:08.039
No!

20:10.909 --> 20:12.610
No!

20:15.914 --> 20:18.482
<i>No no!</i>

20:18.484 --> 20:19.850
No!

20:19.852 --> 20:22.787
The z-phone 620q.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.957
It's ruined.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.259
( Sighs )
Counter life's
not for you.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.095
Back to the muck bucket.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.964
Can I at least keep the cape?

20:32.966 --> 20:34.999
That's a no-no,
jojo.

20:36.768 --> 20:37.902
Rest in peace,
z-phone.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.770
Rest in peace.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.905
I bet somewhere up there

20:40.907 --> 20:42.440
furry little Templeton

20:42.442 --> 20:43.975
is running around on his wheel

20:43.977 --> 20:45.509
and playing with you right now.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.249
We're going to get
crushed without Maddie.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.884
I don't even know why
we're going to this
Ravens game.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.319
Well, you are still the coach.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.789
Wait. Mom, dad.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.993
I have to tell you something.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.929
I ditched school with my
new ex-best friend Kylie,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.931
and she stole sunglasses.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.933
Maddie had nothing
to do with it.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.234
She was just covering for me.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.370
- No.
- Yes!

21:12.372 --> 21:15.006
That means Maddie can play.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.308
Fine, but tell her she is
still in trouble for lying.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.909
Suit up, Maddie.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.978
We've got some Ravens to beat!

21:21.913 --> 21:23.981
I don't like to brag,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.183
but we crushed
the Ravens 54 to 38,

21:26.185 --> 21:29.787
and I scored 21 of those.
( Laughs )

21:29.789 --> 21:31.789
Oh, I guess I do like to brag.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.124
Oh, and best part
of all of this?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.860
I'm banned from the mall
for six months.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.461
Boom! What?!

21:37.463 --> 21:38.529
Yay!

21:38.531 --> 21:39.997
Let's go cheer on Maddie.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.032
Go porcupines!

21:41.034 --> 21:43.801
You are not going anywhere.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.136
You can start the laundry

21:45.138 --> 21:47.271
while I call Kylie's parents.

21:47.273 --> 21:50.341
Kiss the next two weeks
of your life goodbye.

21:50.343 --> 21:53.944
Oh, just so you know
when you get to my undies,

21:53.946 --> 21:57.048
pre-soak, light starch,
warm iron.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.382
You're a peach.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.258
Got some good news, munch.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.426
I fixed your phone.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.927
What?
Are you kidding?

22:09.929 --> 22:12.163
Don't toy with my
emotions like that.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.999
No, really.
Once I scraped off the hummus

22:15.001 --> 22:16.267
I was able to save the battery

22:16.269 --> 22:17.935
and make a sandwich.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.570
Can I try it?

22:19.572 --> 22:20.938
- Sure.
- Not the sandwich.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.873
The phone.

22:24.309 --> 22:25.476
( Kisses )

22:25.478 --> 22:28.979
Hello, beautiful.
Did you miss daddy?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.414
Only thing is to make it work,

22:30.416 --> 22:32.183
I had to make
some modifications.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.984
You gotta wear this.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.089
Yeah, I'm not gonna wear that.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.990
I'd look like a complete doof.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.959
Do you want the phone
to work or not?

22:43.295 --> 22:44.995
Okay, give me the helmet.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.137
It's still not working.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.039
Really?
'Cause it's working for me.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.476
( Camera shutter clicks )

22:58.478 --> 23:00.211
- And post.
- ( Beeps )
