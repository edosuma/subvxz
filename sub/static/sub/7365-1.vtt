02:28.858 --> 02:31.694
This is your spot, Roy.
Pay attention to it.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.029
Pitch it in there.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.552
You got a gift, Roy.
But it's not enough.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.846
You gotta develop yourself.

02:59.597 --> 03:03.017
Rely too much on your own gift
and you'll fail.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.396
Iris!

03:09.356 --> 03:11.609
Iris!

03:11.901 --> 03:12.902
Gotta go.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.379
Hi.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.049
- Can I see you?
- Right now?

05:40.216 --> 05:42.134
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:43.552 --> 05:47.014
Roy! Roy, what is it?

05:47.306 --> 05:48.933
Wait a minute.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.186
The Cubs sent for me. It's just
a tryout. I haven't made it.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.772
- You'll make it.
- There's so many guys.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.567
Not with your arm.
Wouldn't your daddy be proud?

05:58.776 --> 06:02.071
- I gotta reach for the best in me.
- Promise me you will?

06:02.279 --> 06:04.198
I promise. Come on!

06:14.208 --> 06:16.794
- So when do you have to go?
- Tomorrow.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.712
Oh, God.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.173
I've never been on a train before.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.344
It makes you feel important.

06:29.265 --> 06:31.475
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Iris.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.397
I love you so much.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.566
I want you to marry me.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.860
I do.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.115
I want to send for you.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.174
It's all right.

07:39.752 --> 07:41.920
Thanks, Whammer.
My kid will treasure this.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.381
Are you sure it ain't
for yourself now?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.844
- You see this?
- What's that?

07:49.011 --> 07:52.556
An Olympic athlete was shot
just one day after the slaying...

07:52.765 --> 07:55.142
...of a football star,
Johnny Zirowski.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.853
In each case,
a silver bullet was used.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.856
A silver bullet?
That's crazy.

08:01.065 --> 08:02.733
Max Mercy, the sportswriter?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.319
I don't believe I know you.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.821
Sam Simpson.
"Bud" Simpson. Remember?

08:08.072 --> 08:10.032
I may have heard of you somewhere.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.534
Of course, you know who
this fella is.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.870
Whammer.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.747
You look different in street clothes.

08:16.914 --> 08:20.250
It's always nice to meet
a member of the general public.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.294
You boys heading to Chicago too?

08:22.461 --> 08:23.504
That's right.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.131
I've been invited
to see the Cubs myself.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.424
Is that so?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.928
I'm bringing my slam-bang
pitching prospect for a look-see.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.889
- What's his name?
- Roy Hobbs.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.557
Where'd he play?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.433
Like I said, Max, he's young.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.437
He mowed them down
in that Sabotac Valley game.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.898
You might've heard
of his eight no-hitters.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.275
There he is. I'll bring him over.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.236
You do that.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.663
Max. This is Roy Hobbs.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.998
Max Mercy, syndicated sportswriter.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.834
I'm pleased to meet you.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.460
And this here's the Whammer.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.753
How do you do?

09:04.920 --> 09:06.922
You look different in street clothes.

09:07.131 --> 09:10.426
First Pete and now "Repeat."
Let's play some cards.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.469
Keep up those no-hitters...

09:12.636 --> 09:14.972
...or they'll look for you
at Soda Pop Valley.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.557
Sabotac.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.477
Whatever. Hang on to
the water wagon, old-timer.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.730
- Hey, mister-
- Forget about it.

09:24.982 --> 09:25.983
What'll it be?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.194
Hearts.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.821
Next stop, lola.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.366
Half-hour water stop in lola.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.579
Half-hour water stop!

09:45.127 --> 09:47.629
Mind the time now.
Half-hour only.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.851
Another home run!

10:01.059 --> 10:03.520
Hey, Whammer, that's the way
to hit them!

10:03.687 --> 10:06.106
Come on, Whammer! Hit another one!

10:08.942 --> 10:10.027
Is he the best?

10:10.194 --> 10:14.198
Best there ever was. Best there is now
and best there ever will be.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.368
All right, that's it, folks!

10:18.577 --> 10:21.997
Come on, Whammer!
You got a good audience out here!

10:22.789 --> 10:24.416
You wanna see some more?

10:24.875 --> 10:27.377
You'll have to come to Chicago,
buy a ticket!

10:30.047 --> 10:34.051
You keep that bat, compliments of me.
Nice job! Keep it up!

10:34.301 --> 10:35.803
There he goes, folks!

10:36.011 --> 10:38.555
Whammer! The best baseball player
in the country!

10:46.271 --> 10:49.024
You don't have
enough prizes for him.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.527
He's a natural.
Give me that green doll.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.912
Hey, busher!

11:02.663 --> 11:05.082
Pitch one in here.
I'll knock it to the moon.

11:05.916 --> 11:06.917
All right, folks.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.264
You sure can pick them, Simpson.

11:21.598 --> 11:25.435
I got $10 here says he strikes
Wambold out on three pitch balls.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.938
You old boozer,
your brain's full of mush.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.607
This shit-kicker couldn't
strike me out with 100 pitches.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.318
Three is all he'll need, Whammer.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.028
I love contests of skill.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.281
Do you, honey? So do I.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.576
What about you there,
Huckleberry? Scared?

11:41.743 --> 11:42.744
Not of you, I'm not.

11:42.953 --> 11:46.874
Why don't we go on the other side
of the tracks, so nobody gets hurt.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.377
Come on, folks!

11:52.004 --> 11:54.298
56, 57, 58...

11:54.464 --> 11:56.633
...59, 60 feet...

11:56.883 --> 11:58.468
...6 inches, exactly.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.764
Now here are the rules.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.642
There's gonna be three pitches.

12:06.101 --> 12:10.606
Any ball over the plate, or if Whammer
swings and misses is a strike, okay?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.691
Anything outside the strike zone...

12:12.899 --> 12:15.027
...that means the contest is over...

12:15.235 --> 12:16.862
...and the Whammer wins.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.655
I'll call them.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.907
Why don't you take
some warm-up pitches?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.993
- My arm's loose.
- It's your funeral.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.746
Shall we proceed?
The sun's gonna set.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.210
I wish you hadn't bet that money.
You come by it hard.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.213
I wouldn't have made that bet
if I didn't believe in you.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.840
So come on. There.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.593
We're gonna show
what Roy Hobbs is all about.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.928
- Batter up.
- Keep your shirt on.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.769
Batter up! Let's go! Play ball!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.605
Help you down there, old man?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.858
Throw it here, plowboy!
It don't get lighter.

12:55.025 --> 12:58.111
Chuck it down his whammy.
Chuck it down here.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.863
Give him a shave with it!

13:06.828 --> 13:08.705
- Strike 1!
- Wait a minute.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.708
You okay, Sam?

13:11.875 --> 13:14.294
It's all right. This damn glove.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.472
How will you call them
from back there?

13:25.681 --> 13:28.225
- He looks wild.
- Them your knees shaking?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.727
Mind your business, red-nose,
and play ball!

13:33.063 --> 13:34.648
Throw it in here, greenhorn.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.401
Do it again, Roy.
Come on, boy. Do it again.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.368
- Strike 2!
- He's throwing spitballs!

13:46.576 --> 13:51.039
In a pig's poop. That ball's
as dry as your granddaddy's scalp.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.252
You better not be trying any
funny business out there, rum-pot!

13:56.336 --> 13:58.213
Watch your mouth, mister!

13:58.588 --> 13:59.631
Forget it.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.553
This one's it, Whammer.
This is it. Don't let me down.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.096
Don't let up.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.558
One more, boy.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.902
Come on, Roy. Right by him, baby.
March him out.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.240
Strike 3.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.701
You're out.

15:42.234 --> 15:44.528
Mister, you forgot this!

15:49.908 --> 15:50.951
Wait, mister!

15:51.159 --> 15:52.494
What's your name?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.579
Roy Hobbs!

15:54.788 --> 15:55.831
Here!

15:56.289 --> 15:57.707
Thanks!

16:12.347 --> 16:15.475
Hello. I'm Harriet Bird.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.065
It'll be in 110 papers coast to coast.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.526
I wanna do a little background
on your boy.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.820
Not now. Maybe in the morning.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.822
- Why?
- I'm not feeling well.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.408
Listen, bring that sawbuck
you owe me.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.119
We'll have breakfast on me, okay?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.497
And I can do wonders
for that boy, if you let me.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.334
Rummy.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.712
Everyone thought
he would murder you.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.882
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.844
And the way everyone
rallied around you.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.930
They'll be talking about today
for years to come.

16:55.307 --> 17:00.186
It was just like watching
Sir Lancelot jousting Sir Turquine.

17:00.395 --> 17:03.148
Or was it Maldamor?
I'm not sure.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.028
Have you ever read Homer?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.030
Homer?

17:13.909 --> 17:17.746
Well, only homer I know
has four bases in it.

17:18.997 --> 17:22.791
Homer lived ages ago
and wrote about heroes and gods.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.422
And he would've written about baseball
had he seen you out there today.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.591
You know what? Someday...

17:30.467 --> 17:32.469
...I'll break every record
in the book.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.638
I know I got it in me.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.308
What will you hope to accomplish?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.729
When I walk down the street, people
will say, "There goes Roy Hobbs...

17:42.938 --> 17:44.397
...the best there ever was."

17:47.651 --> 17:49.235
Is that all?

17:49.986 --> 17:52.489
Well, what else is there?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.743
Don't you know?

17:58.286 --> 18:00.497
Isn't there something more?

18:01.456 --> 18:03.208
More glorious?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.379
Do you have a girl?

18:20.892 --> 18:22.644
I'm gonna say good night now.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.771
Harriet.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.358
Would you come
watch me play sometime?

18:29.567 --> 18:32.153
Roy, you are priceless.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.156
- Will you?
- Of course.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.715
I could throw a ball here
and never hit the end.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.633
That's for sure, kid.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.429
- Is that licorice?
- Never mind. Let's go to the hotel.

18:58.888 --> 19:02.475
- How far is it to the stadium?
- We're going to the hotel first.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.562
We gotta get over to the hotel.
I wanna get a drink.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.454
- Hello.
- Hello. Roy?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.956
- This is Harriet.
- Excuse me?

19:25.165 --> 19:27.250
Harriet Bird, silly.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.516
The door's open.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.903
Hello?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.784
How'd you know I was staying here?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.791
What's going on here?

20:07.957 --> 20:10.126
Roy...

20:10.293 --> 20:12.629
...will you be the best
there ever was in the game?

20:13.671 --> 20:14.714
That's right.

20:49.124 --> 20:52.961
All right, kid. Throw strikes now.
Put something on it, now!

20:56.131 --> 21:00.093
He's walking the whole ballpark,
and he's the best pitcher we got.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.137
I should've been a farmer.

21:02.804 --> 21:06.099
Since the day I was born,
I should have been a farmer.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.894
I love chickens
and pigs and ducks.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.565
I'm kind of fond
of nanny goats, I am.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.193
Come on, Fowler!
Throw strikes!

21:17.360 --> 21:19.529
Fowler's killing worms, Pop.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.782
Hey, Fowler!
Don't you know how I hate...

21:22.991 --> 21:24.659
...losing to the Pirates?

21:25.368 --> 21:27.579
My ma urged me
to get out of this game.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.498
When I was a kid,
she pleaded with me.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.960
And I meant to.
You know what I mean? But she died.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.045
Tough.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.547
Now look at me.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.635
I'm wet nurse to a last-place,
dead-to-the-neck-up ball club...

21:42.886 --> 21:45.096
...and I'm choking to death!

21:54.689 --> 21:57.066
Wouldn't you think
I could get a fresh drink...

21:57.275 --> 21:59.277
...after all the years I spent
in this game?

21:59.486 --> 22:03.573
Red, did you talk to my bastard
partner about the drinking fountain?

22:03.781 --> 22:05.867
The Judge said he's working on it.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.077
Working on it?

22:09.412 --> 22:11.164
Son of a bitch!

22:12.415 --> 22:15.210
The day that snake walked
into this ballpark...

22:15.418 --> 22:18.254
...one of the darkest days
of my life, Red.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.245
What do we got here?
The Salvation Army Band?

22:50.787 --> 22:53.289
- Pop Fisher?
- Who wants to know?

22:53.790 --> 22:55.959
I'm Roy Hobbs,
your new right fielder.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.503
- My what?
- It's right here.

23:03.132 --> 23:06.094
- Scotty Carson sent you here?
- That's right.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.013
He must be nuts.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.057
Where do they find these guys?

23:13.518 --> 23:17.063
Fella, you don't start playing ball
at your age. You retire.

23:17.772 --> 23:18.773
Where'd he find you?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.567
The Heeber Oilers.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.318
I've never heard of them.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.820
They're semipro.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.823
Semipro.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.741
Schultz, go warm up.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.830
You ever play organized ball
in your life?

23:34.581 --> 23:36.124
I just got back in the game.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.251
What's that mean?

23:39.210 --> 23:41.045
I used to play in high school.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.840
Excuse me?

23:44.632 --> 23:46.467
I used to play in high school.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.137
Red, he used to play in high school.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.972
That's nice.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.433
Scotty Carson signs him up...

23:53.641 --> 23:56.060
...the Judge okays it,
they ain't talked to me yet.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.730
I got that in my deal
for as long as I live.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.106
They gotta talk to me!

24:00.315 --> 24:02.734
- I got a contract.
- I wanna see it.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.864
Come on, Hinkle!

24:09.449 --> 24:12.618
$500 they give this guy
to play with us.

24:12.827 --> 24:13.870
This ain't legal.

24:14.495 --> 24:18.207
Is Carson your chief scout? He said
he had the authority to sign me.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.959
Yeah, well, he don't have.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.920
Let me talk to you just a minute.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.550
He has, Pop.

24:27.759 --> 24:31.304
You said so yourself,
if he ever found anybody decent.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.681
I know, but look at this guy.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.893
We don't need
no middle-aged rookies.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.562
Well, we sure need somebody.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.109
Hey, fella.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.612
All right, you come at a bad time.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.155
Like Red says...

24:49.489 --> 24:52.158
...Scotty Carson seen
something in you.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.078
Go find Doctor Dizzy and suit up.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.419
Red, I should've been a farmer.

25:04.671 --> 25:08.383
Number 11. That's a bad-luck number.
I won't go into that.

25:08.591 --> 25:09.842
What about 9?

25:10.051 --> 25:11.928
9? Well, you got me.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.598
9 it is. What's in the case?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.141
My bat.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.393
A bat?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.104
Follow me. Second locker down.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.402
Slip this on. See if you got
enough room under the arms.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.154
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.742
If it was close,
why didn't you slide?

25:34.951 --> 25:38.413
I had a cigar in my back pocket.
I didn't wanna break it.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.208
Hear you and Memo
are getting hitched.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.545
I don't know where you heard that.
She says that to everybody.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.046
It's not true.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.340
What's this? Another victim?

25:50.383 --> 25:51.718
Bump Bailey.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.764
- What are you? A new coach?
- New player. Roy Hobbs.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.141
No kidding?

26:00.643 --> 26:02.520
I didn't catch your name.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.525
- Roy Hobbs.
- Max Mercy.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.612
Fowler, I wanna ask you something.

26:15.158 --> 26:16.826
Hobbs?

26:16.993 --> 26:20.121
There'll be a room for you
at the Ellicott Hotel.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.291
Why don't you meet me
in the lobby about 6:30.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.668
We'll get something to eat,
have a talk.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.003
Fine.

26:30.965 --> 26:34.927
Another brilliant find
from our scouting system. Geniuses.

26:35.136 --> 26:36.679
Try this on for size.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.394
Welcome to the majors.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.266
We're not moving.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.490
- Hey, Pop.
- Hi, honey.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.743
You together?

27:42.245 --> 27:43.746
No, I'm meeting Bump.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.544
My niece, Memo Paris. Roy Hobbs.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.295
He's a new player.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.880
How do you do?

27:53.047 --> 27:54.382
Hello.

27:56.634 --> 27:57.760
What position?

27:57.969 --> 28:00.388
- He just started today.
- Right field.

28:01.848 --> 28:05.059
Right? That's Bump's position.
Isn't it, Pop?

28:05.434 --> 28:08.813
Mr. Hobbs is brand-new, and we're
not sure what we'll do with him.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.232
Come on, I'll walk you to a cab.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.736
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.996
Anything wrong?

28:26.664 --> 28:28.791
No, I'm just not used to hotels.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.209
Let's go.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.852
How long were you with the Oilers?

28:48.019 --> 28:49.103
Two weeks.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.689
Two weeks?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.776
And before that?

28:57.570 --> 28:59.989
Just knocked around
from here to there.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.492
You don't mind me asking
these questions, do you?

29:05.661 --> 29:07.663
I read Scotty's report on you.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.832
Said you're one hell of a hitter.

29:11.042 --> 29:14.003
How come you didn't start playing
when you was younger?

29:16.547 --> 29:18.299
I did play when I was younger.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.177
We're already eating.
We got our food.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.887
We've already ordered.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.098
But you gave it up?

29:27.058 --> 29:28.142
Sort of.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.311
But my mind was always
on the game.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.188
So I figured...

29:33.648 --> 29:35.149
...to give it another try.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.361
Just like that?

29:39.695 --> 29:41.030
Just like that.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.698
Where you from?

29:44.450 --> 29:45.785
Does it matter?

29:47.912 --> 29:50.373
Do you always talk this way
about yourself?

29:58.130 --> 30:00.174
Let me tell you something
about Pop.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.302
He gave his heart and soul
to the game...

30:03.761 --> 30:05.805
...only to get it trampled on.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.975
I'd give my right arm
to get him the pennant.

30:13.062 --> 30:16.774
Red, it took me 16 years to get here.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.193
You play me...

30:19.735 --> 30:21.404
...and you'll get the best I got.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.823
I believe you.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.743
Pretty good food, huh?

30:27.910 --> 30:29.620
It's damn good.

30:29.787 --> 30:33.082
You can't spell it,
but it eats pretty good, don't it?

30:35.209 --> 30:38.129
All right. A little hustle,
a little hustle!

30:39.171 --> 30:41.465
I don't know where
that water comes from, but...

30:41.674 --> 30:45.177
Never mind the water.
Just stand up there and hit the ball.

30:46.429 --> 30:48.180
Hobbs.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.765
You wanna sit this one out?

30:57.106 --> 31:00.735
Can you imagine that Judge
sending me a middle-aged rookie?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.320
I'm gonna pay his contract.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.281
I ain't gonna play him.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.657
Never.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.721
That's kind of a bad play there.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.823
- which are so
inherently symptomatic...

31:47.990 --> 31:49.325
...of a losing team.

31:49.492 --> 31:51.619
Sorry, doc, I had a little...
You know.

31:52.536 --> 31:55.289
The mind is a strange thing, men.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.125
We must begin by asking it:

31:58.667 --> 32:00.628
"What is losing?"

32:01.420 --> 32:03.798
Losing is a disease...

32:05.216 --> 32:07.635
...as contagious as polio.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.020
Losing is a disease...

32:18.771 --> 32:21.440
...as contagious as syphilis.

32:25.194 --> 32:28.030
Losing is a disease...

32:28.447 --> 32:30.950
...as contagious
as bubonic plague...

32:31.534 --> 32:33.494
...attacking one...

32:33.702 --> 32:35.579
...but infecting all.

32:42.837 --> 32:44.421
But curable.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.050
Now, I want you to imagine...

32:48.676 --> 32:51.387
...you are on a ship at sea...

32:52.513 --> 32:53.806
...on a vast...

32:55.015 --> 32:58.561
Hobbs, you wanna
sit down and pay attention?

32:58.978 --> 33:00.855
- gently rocking.

33:01.063 --> 33:02.398
Get back in here!

33:03.566 --> 33:05.234
Gently rocking.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.572
Gently rocking.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.908
Gently rocking.

33:23.586 --> 33:25.796
Hobbs.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.425
I'm sending you down, Hobbs.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.135
Class B ball.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.597
Tomorrow morning, you go
to the Great Lakes Association.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.683
- You make the rules.
- That's right.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.185
And you ain't been playing by them.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.688
All these other guys play by them.

33:42.897 --> 33:45.941
- You remember signing a contract?
- I remember signing it...

33:46.108 --> 33:50.195
...to play ball. Not to be put to sleep
by some hypnotist. I won't do that.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.405
You're going down.

33:51.614 --> 33:53.991
Took me a long time to get here.
I won't do it!

33:54.742 --> 33:56.035
I can't.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.622
I came here to play ball.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.461
Hobbs, come back here!

34:15.137 --> 34:17.139
Batting practice tomorrow.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.058
Be there!

34:20.100 --> 34:21.143
I have been...

34:21.310 --> 34:22.686
...every day.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.042
You all squared away?

34:45.250 --> 34:46.460
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.380
Get in the cage.
Let's see what you can do.

34:49.672 --> 34:51.340
Get out of there, Bump.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.434
Show us what you can do.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.215
Try this one, grandpa.

36:07.124 --> 36:10.919
Hobbs. Roy.

36:11.879 --> 36:12.921
Come here!

36:13.088 --> 36:14.757
Let me see that bat.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.680
Not bad, kid.

36:24.641 --> 36:25.684
Where'd you get this?

36:26.060 --> 36:28.437
I made it myself
from a tree near home.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.899
"Wonderboy."
You put that on there?

36:33.567 --> 36:34.735
What does it mean?

36:35.277 --> 36:37.654
I made it a long time ago,
when I was a kid.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.532
I wanted it to be a very special bat.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.369
How about this lightning bolt?

36:43.744 --> 36:46.663
The tree I made it from
was split open by lightning.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.416
I don't figure this.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.586
All those years, and you never played
organized baseball?

36:55.339 --> 36:57.049
Well, I sort of got sidetracked.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.636
Red.

37:00.803 --> 37:02.554
Measure that and weigh it.

37:03.430 --> 37:07.017
If it comes up to specifications,
we'll let you use it.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.437
Now, go on out there
and shag some flies.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.316
Better late than never, Pop.

37:15.275 --> 37:17.236
Red, this is practice.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.030
We'll see.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.827
Knights lead Philadelphia, 3-2.
A golden opportunity to break...

37:25.035 --> 37:27.621
...a long losing streak.
Fowler winds, throws.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.915
Long fly ball.
Bivens moving under.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.292
Here comes Bailey!
Bailey knocks the ball...

37:32.501 --> 37:34.461
...and the ball rolls to the wall!

37:34.670 --> 37:38.132
One run moving across the plate.
That'll make it 3 to 3.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.675
He comes around 3rd base.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.510
Bivens throws the ball to 2nd.

37:41.677 --> 37:45.848
Now it's 4-3, the Phillies. A golden
opportunity and it's down the drain...

37:46.014 --> 37:49.309
...as Bailey boggles the situation
and knocks the ball...

37:49.518 --> 37:51.353
...loose from Bivens' glove.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.481
The Knights can do nothing right,
no matter what they try.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.734
You ain't nailed to the ground.
Move. A little hustle!

37:58.569 --> 37:59.945
Let's go, let's go!

38:00.154 --> 38:03.031
Bumper, I wanna see you
in my office after the game.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.242
I lost it in the sun.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.912
Blinding.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.335
1st! 1st base!

38:16.044 --> 38:17.212
Safe!

38:18.881 --> 38:20.716
All right, all right!

38:20.883 --> 38:23.719
Stay put, Bumper.
You're gonna sit this one out.

38:23.927 --> 38:27.014
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm taking you out.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.891
Do you want an apology from me?

38:29.057 --> 38:30.893
Forget it. I won't apologize.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.728
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

38:32.936 --> 38:36.607
I'm the manager, you're the player.
You sit down and shut your mouth!

38:36.815 --> 38:39.151
- What do you want?
- I want you to sit down!

38:39.359 --> 38:42.487
Gabby, Boone, help him find
his seat! Hobbs, you're up.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.072
What's the matter with you?

38:44.281 --> 38:46.700
Sit down and shut up,
you mouthy prima donna.

38:46.909 --> 38:49.369
- You want apologies from me?
- Sit down!

38:49.578 --> 38:51.121
Trade me and get it over with!

38:51.330 --> 38:53.165
Let me have a hitter up here.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.083
Come on, Hobbs! You're up!

39:12.935 --> 39:14.770
Knock the cover off the ball.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.980
Now batting for Bump Bailey...

39:17.189 --> 39:19.733
...number 9, Roy Hobbs.

39:20.567 --> 39:24.279
Here's a surprise. Fisher will
replace Bump Bailey with number 9.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.031
Number 9 is Roy Hobbs.

39:26.240 --> 39:30.535
Hobbs was brought up in midseason.
I don't know too much about him.

39:30.744 --> 39:33.288
Apparently Fisher's very upset
with Bailey.

39:33.455 --> 39:36.208
Of course Bailey messed up
that play with Bivens.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.044
Two runs came in.
That made the Phillies 4 to 3...

39:39.253 --> 39:40.879
...when the Knights led 3-2...

39:41.088 --> 39:43.674
...trying to get out
of this losing streak.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.052
MacBride's gonna look in again
at Hobbs right now.

39:47.261 --> 39:50.889
He'll check Bivens at 1st.
Baker leading off of 2nd right now.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.058
- Here comes the pitch.
- Strike 1!

39:53.517 --> 39:55.769
Fastball, inside corner, strike 1.

39:55.978 --> 39:59.189
Hobbs didn't like the call.
Well, welcome to the majors.

39:59.398 --> 40:03.318
Mac Bride gave him a good, strong
fastball on the inside corner.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.373
Let me see the ball.

41:02.544 --> 41:05.088
- Not that junk, the ball!
- That junk is the ball.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.883
- That's a ball?
- Jesus, he shot it to pieces!

41:08.091 --> 41:10.010
We want a real ball!

41:27.486 --> 41:29.529
Was that real, the cover coming off?

41:29.738 --> 41:32.574
- You were there. You saw it.
- Yeah, I know.

41:32.741 --> 41:36.828
- Explain that cover coming off.
- I hit it as hard as I could.

41:37.037 --> 41:39.081
Is it true he just walked in one day?

41:39.247 --> 41:40.749
Can we see the bat Hobbs used?

41:40.957 --> 41:43.585
That's the way to grease them.
Ain't no mystery.

41:43.752 --> 41:45.754
Give us a break!
Where'd you find him?

41:45.921 --> 41:48.507
Scouts found him.
They always look for young players.

41:48.715 --> 41:52.803
- He doesn't look young. Is he 35, 36?
- That's young to me.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.430
Where in the hell did you find him?

41:56.098 --> 41:59.768
As my chief scout, Mr. Carson,
I'm relying on your honor.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.561
Judge, I'm doing what you asked.

42:01.728 --> 42:04.231
Hobbs is a joke,
a nobody from nowhere.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.109
Yes, that's just what
concerns me, Mr. Carson.

42:07.317 --> 42:11.071
It's about time we found out
just who he is and where he's from.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.614
Good day.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.296
Nice bat.

42:28.505 --> 42:31.717
- You like it?
- Yeah.

42:31.883 --> 42:35.053
Do you think I'll be able to make
one of those bats?

42:38.223 --> 42:39.391
Tell you what.

42:40.183 --> 42:41.643
Go down to the lumberyard...

42:41.810 --> 42:44.479
...pick yourself out
a really good piece of wood...

42:45.522 --> 42:48.442
...and we'll work on it together.
- All right. Thanks.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.278
- See you.
- See you.

43:08.003 --> 43:09.337
Hobbs.

43:09.504 --> 43:12.674
I'm Max Mercy. I met you
in the locker room with Bump.

43:13.341 --> 43:15.719
Interesting way you mistreat
a baseball.

43:17.679 --> 43:18.847
Can I buy you a beer?

43:19.055 --> 43:21.516
- No, I'm in a hurry.
- I wanna ask you something.

43:23.018 --> 43:25.061
- Do I look familiar to you?
- You? No.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.522
Because you sure
look familiar to me.

43:27.731 --> 43:30.192
- Where you from, Hobbs?
- Nowhere special.

43:30.525 --> 43:32.819
Wait. You ever play
in a Cardinal organization?

43:32.986 --> 43:34.738
No.

43:36.990 --> 43:41.244
Well, it'll come to me in a minute.
I got a terrific memory.

43:42.412 --> 43:43.955
See you around, Hobbs.

43:56.551 --> 43:59.471
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Iris. How was your weekend?

43:59.638 --> 44:02.015
- Swell.
- What can I get you?

44:02.224 --> 44:03.850
One of those, cup of coffee.

44:04.059 --> 44:05.185
Help yourself.

44:05.393 --> 44:09.189
- AI, did you read Mercy's article?
- Why should I read it? I heard it.

44:09.397 --> 44:12.150
Must've been the rain.
Stitches probably got loose.

44:12.359 --> 44:14.986
It didn't start to rain
till after he hit the ball.

44:15.195 --> 44:19.324
- The ball was defective.
- Defective. He made a meal out of it.

44:19.991 --> 44:22.410
- What's the name of his bat?
- Wonderboy!

44:22.577 --> 44:23.745
"Wonderboy."

44:25.539 --> 44:29.167
You guys. You know, people are
always running down amazing things.

44:29.376 --> 44:33.171
This guy Hobbs, you ain't seen
nothing yet. I got a feeling.

44:33.380 --> 44:36.967
Wonderboy. You gotta be kidding!

44:37.425 --> 44:38.593
See you later, Al.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.595
Okay, Ralph.

44:53.441 --> 44:56.444
Our cameras turn
to the world of sports.

44:56.611 --> 44:59.114
In response to
Max Mercy's accusation...

44:59.322 --> 45:01.116
...that Wonderboy was
a loaded bat...

45:01.283 --> 45:03.326
...Commissioner Gates
made a statement.

45:03.535 --> 45:05.287
We measured and weighed the bat...

45:05.495 --> 45:07.956
...and it is within
League specifications.

45:08.164 --> 45:12.043
Therefore, the bat is legal
and may be used in League play.

45:12.252 --> 45:13.670
Hold up the bat!

45:14.379 --> 45:17.799
"Wonderboy"! And oh, what a bat it is!

45:21.553 --> 45:24.556
My gut tells me this,
and Red agrees.

45:25.390 --> 45:28.643
We feel Hobbs can fill
your position very neatly.

45:29.269 --> 45:31.813
We'll give you one more chance
to shape up.

45:32.147 --> 45:34.065
Otherwise, it's the bench.

45:36.651 --> 45:39.654
Top of the 7th right now.
Knights leading Boston, 6-3.

45:39.863 --> 45:44.117
Bump Bailey's 2 for 2 and made
a great catch off the right-field wall.

45:44.326 --> 45:45.910
Bailey at the top of his game.

45:46.328 --> 45:48.705
Looks like your talk to Bump
is paying off.

45:48.914 --> 45:51.124
I gotta believe you're right.

45:51.333 --> 45:53.168
Fowler has very good control.

45:53.335 --> 45:57.339
Abel takes a slight leadoff to 2nd,
Fowler tries to move him back.

45:57.505 --> 46:00.133
Fair ball, swung on.
Long fly ball out there!

46:00.342 --> 46:03.094
Bailey going way back!
This ball is hit real deep.

46:03.261 --> 46:04.679
Bailey looks up!

46:04.846 --> 46:07.349
He hits off the wall!
The ball rolls free.

46:07.557 --> 46:10.143
Bailey went through the wall, folks.

46:10.352 --> 46:12.270
There's no movement at all.

46:12.479 --> 46:13.938
He's certainly down.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.107
Bailey looks like
he's seriously hurt.

46:28.870 --> 46:33.375
In a stirring ceremony at Knights
Field, star Bump Bailey's ashes...

46:33.541 --> 46:36.711
...were dropped from a plane
as fans and ballplayers stood...

46:37.087 --> 46:39.255
...and paid their last respects.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.216
Bump Bailey died after crashing...

46:41.424 --> 46:45.387
...headfirst into the right-field wall
in pursuit of a fly ball.

46:45.595 --> 46:48.431
A great catch that almost was.

46:48.890 --> 46:50.975
Rest in peace, Bump Bailey.

46:51.184 --> 46:52.686
Baseball will miss you.

46:56.231 --> 46:57.565
Play ball!

46:57.732 --> 47:01.236
Over 27,000 fans are here,
paying their respects to Bump Bailey.

47:01.444 --> 47:03.446
Hobbs stepping up to bat right now.

47:03.655 --> 47:08.159
As you remember, just the other day,
Hobbs knocked the cover off the ball.

47:08.535 --> 47:12.080
He had an auspicious beginning.
Hobbs hitting from the left side.

47:12.247 --> 47:14.541
Looking in right now,
Hobbs in his stance.

47:15.709 --> 47:18.003
Here's the pitch.
He swings. Long fly ball!

47:18.211 --> 47:19.713
Way, way, way back!

47:21.256 --> 47:25.218
Way up into the rafters there!
An unbelievable hit from Roy Hobbs!

47:25.427 --> 47:27.137
Incredible power!

47:28.555 --> 47:30.432
As good a hit as I've seen all year.

47:30.598 --> 47:34.102
Hobbs rounds the bases.
Roy Hobbs, 2 for 2.

47:35.103 --> 47:37.981
Maybe we can expect
good things from Roy Hobbs.

47:44.779 --> 47:46.990
You've never seen Hobbs before?

47:47.198 --> 47:50.493
No, I already told you that.
What do you got on your mind?

47:52.829 --> 47:54.122
Strange.

47:57.876 --> 48:00.128
You really threw
that lumber around today.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.464
We broke a few windows, didn't we?

48:03.798 --> 48:07.135
Real good. You know, there's not
a mark on it. Not a nick.

48:07.343 --> 48:09.429
I boned it so it wouldn't chip.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.056
You know what I like?

48:13.141 --> 48:14.726
I like this lightning bolt.

48:15.435 --> 48:19.022
When I was a kid, my father gave me
his collection of squadron insignias.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.399
The kind flying aces used to wear.

48:21.649 --> 48:23.151
It reminds me of that.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.820
- Nice going.
- Nice game, guys.

48:26.529 --> 48:28.114
Wanna get something to eat?

48:29.365 --> 48:30.992
Sure.

48:34.788 --> 48:37.916
Hey, Olsen, nice patch.
Try putting it over your eye.

48:39.334 --> 48:42.045
All right, I ain't talking,
I'm hitting.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.675
- Impressive.
- It must be the patch.

48:47.842 --> 48:49.844
It's like Samson with his hair.

48:53.348 --> 48:54.599
He came alive.

48:54.808 --> 48:56.017
Well, he sure did.

48:56.184 --> 48:59.354
There seems to be a mistake.
Olsen's hitting the ball.

49:00.230 --> 49:02.190
I want one of those for myself.

50:42.790 --> 50:45.126
- Hobbs' homer, goes into the 11th!

50:45.335 --> 50:47.921
Home runs, triples, singles...

50:48.129 --> 50:49.964
Anything he wants to hit, he hits.

50:50.882 --> 50:52.592
I've never seen anything like it.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.302
It's incredible.

50:54.636 --> 50:56.679
Anything he wants to do, he does.

50:57.013 --> 51:00.683
I mean, how can somebody play
that well that came from nowhere?

51:02.936 --> 51:05.980
New York Knights powerhouse hitter
Roy Hobbs...

51:06.147 --> 51:08.149
...a shining example
to his young fans.

51:08.358 --> 51:11.235
Though embarrassed by praise
and shy of the press...

51:11.444 --> 51:14.113
...Hobbs is always there
for an autograph.

51:14.822 --> 51:16.991
Well, I'm sure gonna try real hard.

51:17.158 --> 51:19.327
What's it take to be a big leaguer?

51:19.786 --> 51:21.746
You need a lot
of little boy in you...

51:21.955 --> 51:23.831
...so you guys
qualify pretty well.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.335
What's your name?

51:27.877 --> 51:30.338
And with a few
words of wisdom that...

51:30.546 --> 51:32.674
...who knows, might alter
the destiny...

51:32.840 --> 51:35.176
...of one of these fine young fans.

51:36.010 --> 51:39.180
Let me tell you something about Pop.
He thinks he's jinxed.

51:39.347 --> 51:40.515
What do you mean?

51:40.682 --> 51:43.851
Last season he had
some financial problems.

51:44.727 --> 51:48.106
He had to sell the Judge
10 percent of his shares.

51:49.315 --> 51:52.986
That makes the Judge the majority
stockholder of the Knights.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.155
But he got one condition
in the contract.

51:56.698 --> 51:58.866
If he can win
the pennant this season...

51:59.033 --> 52:01.703
...he can buy the shares back,
and the Judge is out.

52:03.037 --> 52:04.372
If he loses...

52:04.539 --> 52:06.374
...he's out, and he has to sell.

52:06.666 --> 52:08.293
And winner take all.

52:21.055 --> 52:22.682
"If I Had You."

52:26.227 --> 52:27.645
"Small Hotel."

52:34.694 --> 52:36.112
"Dear Old Girl."

52:49.917 --> 52:53.087
I'd have bet money you
wouldn't know that song!

52:57.258 --> 52:58.760
Hey, Roy, pitch it in!

52:58.968 --> 53:01.679
Come on, let me see what you got!

53:02.597 --> 53:05.683
- Come on, just one more.
- Throw him one.

53:06.434 --> 53:08.269
I wanna knock it into the stands!

53:08.478 --> 53:10.396
Come on, Roy, pitch it in!

53:10.938 --> 53:14.400
- I bet you 10 bucks he can whiff you.
- You already owe me $10.

53:14.609 --> 53:16.569
- Double or nothing then.
- You're on.

53:17.653 --> 53:18.821
Pitch it here!

53:19.030 --> 53:21.532
One more, Roy!
Right into the stands!

53:31.417 --> 53:33.461
Barrel one down his main street!

53:52.271 --> 53:54.273
He really burnt that in there.

54:02.573 --> 54:04.659
Hey, Roy.

54:05.910 --> 54:08.329
- Yeah?
- Roy, come in here a minute.

54:10.832 --> 54:12.083
What's up?

54:12.250 --> 54:14.085
Ask the Judge.

54:16.254 --> 54:18.923
- The Judge?
- He wants to see you.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.511
I should go with you.

54:25.429 --> 54:26.889
No, I can handle it.

54:31.686 --> 54:33.104
I hope so.

54:36.524 --> 54:38.734
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:38.901 --> 54:42.071
- I'm Roy Hobbs.
- Yes, the Judge is expecting you.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.531
Go right in.

54:44.365 --> 54:45.450
Thank you.

54:50.455 --> 54:52.248
Mr. Hobbs.

54:52.415 --> 54:54.292
Come in. Come in.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.381
We meet at last.

55:03.384 --> 55:04.719
This is a swell office.

55:05.386 --> 55:07.555
Mere creature comforts.

55:08.222 --> 55:10.433
Could use a little more light though.

55:15.563 --> 55:17.064
Where you from, Hobbs?

55:18.399 --> 55:21.402
All around, really.
What about you?

55:24.530 --> 55:27.200
Please pardon the absence of light.

55:27.992 --> 55:31.662
You see, as a youngster I was
frightened of the dark...

55:31.871 --> 55:35.374
...and I used to wake up sobbing
in it as if it was water...

55:35.583 --> 55:37.084
...and I was drowning in it.

55:38.211 --> 55:39.670
As you will observe, I have...

55:39.879 --> 55:42.548
...disciplined myself
against that fear...

55:42.757 --> 55:44.300
...that now I much prefer...

55:44.508 --> 55:46.177
...a dark room.

55:47.595 --> 55:50.848
The only thing I know about the dark
is, you can't see in it.

55:52.558 --> 55:53.768
A pure canard.

55:54.143 --> 55:55.228
What's a canard?

55:56.562 --> 55:57.688
A prevarication.

55:57.855 --> 56:00.107
- What's that mean?
- A lie.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.486
You can see, you know.

56:05.363 --> 56:06.614
Well, not good enough.

56:07.365 --> 56:09.408
You see me, don't you?

56:10.117 --> 56:11.536
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

56:19.961 --> 56:23.548
I asked you here because I wanted to
pay you my compliments...

56:23.756 --> 56:26.884
...for your performance in the field.

56:29.720 --> 56:30.888
It's been fun.

56:31.097 --> 56:33.808
Oh, you made a great contribution.

56:34.767 --> 56:37.603
Stands have been constantly filled.

56:39.021 --> 56:43.067
Financial fortunes have been
radically reversed since you joined.

56:43.818 --> 56:44.902
I hadn't noticed.

56:45.611 --> 56:48.489
You're not fascinated
by the almighty dollar?

56:50.157 --> 56:51.826
I never gave it much thought.

56:53.494 --> 56:56.163
You're above such
mundane thoughts, huh?

56:56.497 --> 56:57.832
I didn't say that.

56:58.165 --> 57:00.835
No, I'm as interested in a buck
as anybody else.

57:01.210 --> 57:04.964
And I am not one to let
good deeds go unrewarded.

57:05.548 --> 57:07.717
Would a new contract interest you?

57:07.883 --> 57:10.136
Yeah.

57:10.303 --> 57:11.512
For more money.

57:13.014 --> 57:15.266
You wanna pay me more,
that's up to you.

57:17.226 --> 57:20.229
I don't detect any gratitude
on your part, Mr. Hobbs.

57:21.314 --> 57:24.817
I'm under no legal obligation
to pay you one penny more.

57:26.610 --> 57:28.529
Either way, I play to win.

57:29.030 --> 57:31.866
A young man your age
ought to think about your future.

57:32.366 --> 57:34.327
Well, let me put it to you this way:

57:36.454 --> 57:39.832
There's no way I'm gonna let you
steal this club from Pop.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.960
The fact is,
Pop is a jinxed man.

57:43.169 --> 57:45.713
All the Roy Hobbses
in the world can't change that.

57:45.880 --> 57:49.717
- Well, it'll be a team effort.
- You're a very impudent man.

57:50.259 --> 57:51.886
The interview is ended.

58:00.227 --> 58:03.856
You come back here and turn off
that infernal light!

58:10.237 --> 58:12.073
He's not as greedy as Bump.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.576
He'll be hard to work with,
but we'll get him.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.297
How'd it go up there, kiddo?

58:28.923 --> 58:32.718
What are you doing here? Stay home
in bed and quit tailing me around.

58:32.927 --> 58:36.013
You really are a riddle.
What are you trying to hide?

58:36.222 --> 58:39.183
- I ain't hiding a thing.
- Well, who says you are?

58:39.433 --> 58:40.601
You know...

58:40.810 --> 58:44.897
...old Sam Simpson died before
he could give me the lowdown on you.

58:45.314 --> 58:47.775
But I want you to look at this.

58:49.193 --> 58:52.738
What you have in your hand is
a great story, but I want it all.

58:54.448 --> 58:55.491
A Max Mercy exclusive.

58:55.700 --> 58:58.035
I don't want the public to get
the wrong idea.

58:58.244 --> 58:59.912
Stories are floating around.

59:00.121 --> 59:02.706
One says you played
for another major-league team.

59:02.873 --> 59:05.710
One says you were
an acrobat in the circus.

59:05.876 --> 59:09.088
There's even a crazy story
that said you killed someone.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.883
Let them believe
what they wanna believe.

59:13.467 --> 59:16.887
My paper will guarantee you
five grand, cash, for your story.

59:17.471 --> 59:21.308
It'll give your fans something
to keep up their goodwill in you.

59:21.475 --> 59:23.060
Okay?

59:23.227 --> 59:25.730
Once you get to know me better,
you'll like me.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.531
Hi, kid. How are you doing?

59:35.739 --> 59:36.991
Nice to see you.

59:38.117 --> 59:41.162
We're gonna meet a guy
named Gus Sands, all right?

59:41.328 --> 59:42.496
Who's he?

59:42.663 --> 59:45.499
You're kidding.
He's a $10 million-a-year bookie.

59:45.708 --> 59:47.710
- You never heard of him?
- No.

59:48.002 --> 59:50.045
Awfully nice guy. Awfully nice.

59:51.046 --> 59:53.758
They don't have bands like that
in Nebraska, do they?

59:53.966 --> 59:56.343
That's not where I'm from,
but they aren't there either.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:02.016
Gus?

01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:06.020
You know-
Here. You know Roy Hobbs.

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:08.481
Yeah, sure.
I know all about Roy Hobbs.

01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:10.232
Everybody here know everybody?

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:12.026
Sit down.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.863
- Have a drink, slugger?
- No, thanks.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.073
Strictly a Wheaties man, right?

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:19.825
Well, the eyes.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.745
- Gotta keep them clear.
- Oh, yes.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.413
How'd it go today, slugger?

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.917
He did better than we did.
He got 5 out of 5 in the 1st...

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.085
...and 3 for 4 in the 2nd.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.630
What do you know?
That'll cost me a pretty penny.

01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:33.923
How's that?

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.424
I bet against you today.

01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:37.510
Against the Knights?

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:39.053
Just against you, kid.

01:00:40.513 --> 01:00:42.890
I didn't know you could bet
against one player.

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:45.392
You can bet against
anybody, anything.

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:48.020
Strikes, balls, hits, runs, errors.

01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:49.396
Take your pick.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:54.401
I once bet $100,000
on three pitched balls.

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:55.903
How'd you make out?

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:58.072
Didn't.

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:02.910
But the next week, I ruined the guy
with a different deal.

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:06.497
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you don't.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:09.375
I lost with you today...

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:12.253
...but some other time,
I'll clean up double.

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:13.754
How you gonna do that?

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.590
When you're not batting so good.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.093
How will you know
when that is?

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.638
The magic eye. It sees all.

01:01:23.556 --> 01:01:25.266
Show him how it works. Go on.

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.935
Yeah, sure. Why not?

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:33.399
I'll bet that I can tell,
within a buck either way...

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:36.151
...how much money
you've got in your pocket.

01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:40.281
I'll take that chance.

01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:42.116
For a thousand dollars?

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:46.495
Better make it a hundred.
You know the Judge.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:48.622
A hundred it is.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.554
You got 10 bucks.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.816
- What is it?
- Eight dollars.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.276
You lose.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.820
And the silver?

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:24.658
The silver.

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:30.998
A dollar, what, 37?

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:35.294
Never misses. Right, sugar?

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.671
Just a lucky guy, Gus.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:40.174
That's pretty good. I owe you 100.

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:42.259
Forget it. Forget it.

01:02:42.468 --> 01:02:45.179
Someday you'll maybe
do me a favor, eh?

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:48.349
Don't bet on it.

01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:53.312
Excuse me.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:01.195
What?

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.158
I think you overlooked these.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.495
We call it even?

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.708
Would you like to dance?

01:03:19.672 --> 01:03:21.256
What do you know about him?

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:24.093
Not much. Not very much.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:29.431
But I got a questionnaire out in
a thousand papers all over the West.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.266
Somebody's gotta claim him, right?

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.559
Right.

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:36.605
- Are you interested?
- Yeah, I could be, Max. Could be.

01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:39.733
I can't pay enough
for good information these days.

01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:42.444
Thank you.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:45.906
It's nice to know my hair
is full of silver.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:49.535
Can you read my mind too?

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.745
No. I'm not good at that.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.748
You don't mind if I just look?

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.210
Isn't that what you've been doing?

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.004
So far.

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:03.882
So far it's fun.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.469
Does it get better in private?

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:12.766
I have a car.

01:04:13.726 --> 01:04:15.310
What about Gus?

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.523
I'll tell him you made me disappear.

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:34.496
My father walked out on us
when I was a little girl.

01:04:36.832 --> 01:04:39.960
I don't remember being happy
until I was about 18 or 19.

01:04:40.169 --> 01:04:41.503
Then what happened?

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.256
Then I won a beauty contest.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:46.467
How could you lose?

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:51.221
You know, it's strange,
but ever since the hotel, I feel...

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.309
...like we've met before.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.770
I doubt it.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:03.901
- So, what about you?
- What about me?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.361
Now it's your turn to tell.

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.156
Me? What's there to tell?

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:12.785
Come on, I don't have any secrets.

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:15.287
Maybe. But I do.

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:17.790
What about magic?

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:20.167
Where did you learn magic?

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:23.837
I just picked it up around, through
the years, like a lot of things.

01:05:25.506 --> 01:05:26.715
Like what?

01:05:27.216 --> 01:05:28.509
Baseball.

01:05:30.052 --> 01:05:32.179
"Baseball." Max was right.

01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:33.847
You're just a mystery.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:36.809
- I mean I don't know...
- Max.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.144
He's just after a story.

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:41.605
What about Gus?
He's quite a character.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.609
Bump introduced us.

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.364
He picked me up when I was down.

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.492
He's a friend.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.706
I'm not waiting for true love
to come along, Roy.

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:02.501
I never have.

01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:06.421
I've known a million guys.

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:08.882
Bump was swell.

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.343
He was real swell, but typical.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.805
You're not like him...

01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:17.057
...or anyone else.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.563
Gus gives me things.

01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:27.734
Things I've never had in my life.

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.239
Anything wrong with that?

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:35.409
Not if you understand the risks.

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:42.166
There are always risks.

01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:02.352
Touch me.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:39.848
312, please.

01:07:42.184 --> 01:07:43.352
Thanks.

01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.441
See you later.

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.656
- You know what time it is?
- Yeah.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:58.659
I could fine you. I would,
if you were making any money.

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.118
Wait till next year.

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:04.456
There might not be a next year for you,
you keep pulling stunts like this.

01:08:04.665 --> 01:08:06.541
How long
you been seeing her anyway?

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.168
Since tonight.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:10.629
I'd better tell you something.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:12.965
You're a grown man.

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.884
What you do with your personal time
is your own business.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.679
I got it in the back of my mind,
that girl's bad luck.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.390
- Well, you're a swell uncle.
- Got nothing to do with it.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.892
I love her.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.729
But I believe that bad luck has a way
of rubbing itself off on other people.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.189
Pop, don't worry about me.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:33.359
Well, I am.
See, I'm just considering you.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:34.987
I'll consider me.

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:42.452
Strike 31

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:00.761
Where were you?

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.055
I was with Gus.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.228
He thought something
happened to me last night.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.564
It did.

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.251
Strike 3!

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.336
You all right?

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:34.921
We'll get them next time.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.301
Haven't you been paying attention?

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.261
Strike 3!

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:51.145
You miss me?

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:56.777
Strike!

01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:16.588
What?

01:10:18.507 --> 01:10:21.718
- Are you-? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.303
It's all right.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:24.596
Sorry, I...

01:10:24.805 --> 01:10:26.306
It's all right.

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:28.850
I just touched you right here.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:30.644
It's okay.

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.026
What are you doing,
calling that man out?

01:10:38.193 --> 01:10:39.361
Because he was out!

01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:42.155
Do you need eyeglasses?

01:10:46.118 --> 01:10:49.329
The team bus is now
at the 34th Street entrance.

01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:51.998
Bus is at the 34th Street entrance.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.918
Let's go.

01:11:01.466 --> 01:11:03.135
Straighten that good-looking tie.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:06.430
Okay. Bye.

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:16.064
- How you doing?
- Well, okay.

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:34.040
Cub programs!

01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:37.544
Get your Cub program here!
Ten cents.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:40.714
Get your official Cub program here!
Ten cents.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.221
Peanuts! Five cents.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:53.226
Now batting for New York,
number 9, Roy Hobbs.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:55.312
Hobbs coming to bat right now.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.233
He has a terrible batting score.
Can't get himself on the track at all.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.697
Hobbs, trying to get
something started.

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:08.909
And here comes the pitch.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:12.162
Strike the bum out!

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.080
Strike 21

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:16.583
Lazy pitch there.
Strike 31

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.960
Hobbs goes down.
3 pitches, 3 strikes.

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:20.587
You're a bum!

01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:24.132
Maybe you should try another bat.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:26.218
Whatever's wrong isn't the bat.

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:33.433
Knights lead the Cubs 2-1.

01:12:33.642 --> 01:12:36.311
Fowler's stepping up to the bat.
Short ball, a hit!

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.441
That's gonna be out in the right field.
He'll fire the ball into 3rd base.

01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:44.444
Safe at 3rd base!

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:48.949
At the end of the 6th,
it's all tied up, 3-3.

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:54.913
Cubs leading by 1. Bivens at
the plate. He swings. Fly ball.

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:57.624
Camaretti has problems.
He fumbles the ball!

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:01.294
Bivens heads to 2nd base.
Here comes the throw!

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.478
Now batting for New York,
number 18...

01:13:18.687 --> 01:13:20.814
...John Olsen.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:54.472
Now batting for New York,
number 9, Roy Hobbs.

01:13:57.392 --> 01:14:00.979
Hobbs just can't get himself on track.
He's 0 for 2 today.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:03.148
Stepping up right now,
he gets the signal.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.609
Bivens is at 3rd base.
3 to 3.

01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:08.194
Strike 1!

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:11.531
Pop Fisher's not happy.
Here's the pitch.

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:14.451
- Swings and...
- Strike 2!

01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:21.041
He just can't get himself set.
He hasn't had the concentration.

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:23.877
Sit down!

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:18.431
Folks, I'm telling you,
I've seen some power before...

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.975
...but certainly Hobbs...

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.186
Over here!

01:15:23.395 --> 01:15:26.439
- Where you going?
- You ever hit one that far before?

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:33.613
Hobbs, turn around, will you?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.323
What's he looking at?

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:37.450
- One more.
- Hobbs, over here.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.126
This is for you.

01:15:47.794 --> 01:15:49.212
Nice lady.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:42.557
Are you married?

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:45.935
Hi, folks. What can I get you?

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:50.064
- AI, I'd like you to meet Roy Hobbs.
- Are you kidding?

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:53.693
What do you think I ran here for?
We got jiffy service? My pleasure.

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.195
He's a great fan of yours.

01:16:55.487 --> 01:16:57.530
- What can I get you?
- You got any lemonade?

01:16:57.697 --> 01:16:59.115
Sure have.

01:16:59.324 --> 01:17:02.327
- I'd like the same, please.
- Two lemonades, coming up.

01:17:04.204 --> 01:17:06.664
No, not married.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.209
Are you?

01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:11.336
No.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:16.299
It's unbelievable someone with your
looks would be on the loose so long.

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:18.384
Well...

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.428
I don't get lonely.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:27.644
How is it the girls missed you?

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:32.023
I didn't see any point
in settling down.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.735
Two lemonades.

01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:37.111
Oh, boy.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.072
Ain't she a peach?

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:42.534
I come here a lot.

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:46.913
You go to many games?

01:17:47.539 --> 01:17:48.540
No.

01:17:51.251 --> 01:17:52.585
So why did you come?

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:54.629
Maybe I shouldn't have.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.756
I'm glad you did.

01:17:57.257 --> 01:18:00.927
Well, I don't know.
We're not kids anymore.

01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:02.762
Things are never the same.

01:18:05.098 --> 01:18:06.474
Am I different?

01:18:07.976 --> 01:18:09.394
Am I?

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:13.898
Yeah.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:15.942
A lot.

01:18:22.949 --> 01:18:25.785
I thought I saw you once
in a train station here.

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:28.997
Really?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.460
I used to look for you in crowds...

01:18:35.253 --> 01:18:38.089
...thinking someday
maybe you'd be there.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.135
Somewhere I stopped.

01:18:49.017 --> 01:18:50.935
What happened to you, Roy?

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.369
My life didn't turn out
the way I expected.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.920
- What is it?
- I've gotta go.

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:21.132
- How come?
- I've just got to.

01:19:25.178 --> 01:19:27.305
I'd like you to come
to the game tomorrow.

01:19:27.722 --> 01:19:29.349
I can't.

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:32.143
- I came today.
- I see. You work?

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:37.523
Come.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:19:59.754
Hello?

01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:01.422
Surprise!

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.508
It's me, Memo.

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:06.719
Hi. Where are you?

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:09.430
I'm here in my room...

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:13.935
...sitting in a white slip,
thinking of you.

01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:17.355
Hey. I miss you.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.148
I miss you too.

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.026
Did you hear? We won today.

01:20:22.694 --> 01:20:24.237
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.866
Congratulations.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.536
Thanks.

01:20:32.412 --> 01:20:34.414
But you better get some rest.

01:20:35.415 --> 01:20:36.874
You'll need it.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.420
- Good night.
- Good night, Roy.

01:20:46.634 --> 01:20:48.428
And I love you too.

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.224
That was cute.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.601
Smooth enough?

01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:01.065
You are in control, aren't you, pal?

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:04.152
Sure, Gus.

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:06.779
Sure.

01:21:08.573 --> 01:21:11.159
Hobbs steps up.
He shattered the clock yesterday.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.954
That's good! Bottom of the 3rd
inning. Hobbs looking in.

01:21:15.163 --> 01:21:18.833
He swings! There's no doubt about
that one! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:21.335
9 to 3. Bottom of the 6th.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:25.089
He swings! There it goes!
Oh, my!

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:27.300
9th inning.

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.969
Here's the pitch. He swings!
I don't believe it!

01:21:30.178 --> 01:21:33.973
Four in a row! What a day for Hobbs!

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.524
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.318
I just wanted to...

01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:47.612
I'm glad you came.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.576
Just think what I would've missed.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.328
That was just luck.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.288
I know better.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.542
Wait. Are you going?

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:05.379
- No.
- Can we...

01:22:07.298 --> 01:22:09.217
...walk a bit?

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:12.178
All right.

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:19.852
I met a woman
on a train to Chicago...

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:23.481
...and it was a mistake.

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.526
- Do you mean when you first left?
- Yeah.

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:29.779
That was the beginning
of a lot of mistakes...

01:22:35.243 --> 01:22:37.453
I was in the hospital
for a couple of years.

01:22:39.247 --> 01:22:42.375
Finally I got out, and they
told me I couldn't play ball.

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:49.340
I didn't have any money,
and jobs were hard to come by.

01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:51.217
I lost my confidence.

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:53.553
Then there was just no going back.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.520
How long have you been in Chicago?

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:06.440
Well, I guess that's about 10 years.

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:21.497
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:23.332
- Sure?
- I don't wanna put you out.

01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:26.085
It's not putting me out.
I'll just brew it up.

01:23:26.252 --> 01:23:27.503
- Nice cup of coffee?
- No.

01:23:27.712 --> 01:23:30.548
- Something simple, iced tea?
- Iced tea.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.592
I don't have any, but I'll brew some.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.135
You have to brew some?

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:38.180
- Then I'll have some coffee, okay?
- Okay.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.438
This is a swell apartment.

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:47.148
Thanks.

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:54.405
Did you sell the farm?

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.365
No.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:58.326
I'll always have that.

01:23:59.911 --> 01:24:01.287
Good.

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:03.789
It's home.

01:24:39.659 --> 01:24:41.160
It's my son's.

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:49.752
He means the world to me.

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:53.839
He's a great kid.

01:24:58.386 --> 01:24:59.929
I'll bet he is.

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:06.852
I'd like to meet him.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.980
He's coming home pretty soon.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:12.191
Is he with his father?

01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:14.276
No.

01:25:17.989 --> 01:25:20.199
His father lives in New York.

01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:24.287
Oh, you're...

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:29.000
But I've been thinking that he needs
his father now. He's at that age.

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:31.377
I think he needs him.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:36.716
Sure.

01:25:37.717 --> 01:25:39.719
A father makes all the difference.

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:19.133
You gotta catch your train.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.468
I can stay.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:22.386
You'd better go.

01:26:25.264 --> 01:26:27.808
Yeah.

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:30.436
Yeah.

01:26:31.937 --> 01:26:34.106
Where to next?

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:37.109
Boston.

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:43.616
I'm sorry I missed your boy.

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:46.494
I'll tell him.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.120
Roy Hobbs.

01:26:48.788 --> 01:26:51.082
He won't believe it.

01:27:54.228 --> 01:27:55.271
That's good!

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:56.730
Do a goose step now!

01:27:57.857 --> 01:28:00.025
I'm trying to shelter this guy.

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:01.819
Have a peanut, Bobby.

01:28:02.528 --> 01:28:04.864
No, it's too late.
He's gonna be too old.

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.615
Did you do your homework?

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:11.245
- All right!
- Here goes nothing.

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.752
I blew a little too hard there.

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:28.888
Hobbs is making the whole situation
impossible to predict.

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:30.598
Only more difficult.

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:34.894
Hobbs will make it more interesting,
but he won't make the difference.

01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:50.784
- Safe! Safe!
- He dropped the ball!

01:28:56.916 --> 01:29:00.044
Here's the pitch.
Hobbs swings! Long fly ball!

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.088
That's right! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:06.759
The Knights have tied for the finish!
They've tied for the finish!

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:10.763
You can hear this crowd! They're
going crazy! They got Hobbs...

01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:35.579
Knock it off!

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:38.123
Hey, knock it off!

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:44.421
We gotta win another game
before this is over.

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:47.174
Don't jinx this. Look at this!

01:29:49.802 --> 01:29:51.095
Now, come on.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.347
Go home, get some sleep.

01:29:53.806 --> 01:29:56.642
Knock off the booze. No booze!

01:30:12.658 --> 01:30:16.120
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Would you place your call again later?

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:18.289
Okay, thanks.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.544
The Knights simply have to win...

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:28.590
...one game against the Phillies
to put them in the World Series.

01:30:28.799 --> 01:30:31.510
That wraps it up here
for this post-game show.

01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:33.929
I'll be right over to pick him up.

01:30:34.138 --> 01:30:37.057
Protect your car
with Valvoline Motor Oil.

01:30:37.266 --> 01:30:39.852
This is Jim Bauer inviting you
to join us...

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:55.701
Boy, did I miss you.

01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:01.540
What's going on here?

01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:03.959
A victory party.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:06.378
We haven't won yet.
Whose place is this?

01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:07.838
Mine.

01:31:08.714 --> 01:31:10.215
At least it will be in a week.

01:31:10.424 --> 01:31:13.761
- You must've hocked your fur for it.
- Never.

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:15.596
Gus chipped in.

01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:18.849
How do you like it?

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.392
I like it.

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:24.646
I'm not so sure anymore...

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:26.899
...after Chicago.

01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:29.068
Come on, Memo,
how about a dance?

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:30.944
Sure, Al.

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:32.905
Don't wait up, grandpa.

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:45.626
Welcome home, slugger.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.545
Some blowout, huh?

01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:51.632
All fresh food
from Jack and Charlie's.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.592
How's the team holding up?

01:31:53.759 --> 01:31:55.052
They can do no wrong.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.305
When you're on a roll,
it's like that sometimes.

01:31:58.514 --> 01:32:01.934
When you're not, every little thing
gets you down. What about you?

01:32:02.142 --> 01:32:03.227
What about me?

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:06.271
I see you dug yourself
out of that hole you were in.

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:09.149
It must have cost you.

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:11.694
You're up, you're down.

01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:13.779
How's the Judge treating you?

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.117
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:21.703
Except it's a shame that son of a bitch
is paying a player like you...

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:23.414
...rock-bottom salary.

01:32:23.622 --> 01:32:26.625
- I can live with it.
- You gotta look to the future.

01:32:27.584 --> 01:32:30.546
You can't build on
what you don't got.

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:33.882
It's nice to know you worry so much
about a guy like me.

01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:38.804
Listen, I'm just bringing it up because
I know Memo's crazy about you.

01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:43.225
I mean, I wouldn't like to see you
lose her to a better provider.

01:32:43.434 --> 01:32:45.310
Fame isn't enough, kid.

01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:48.564
I'll take my chances.

01:32:48.731 --> 01:32:52.776
Why should you, when we can
all profit from these little chats?

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:56.155
I mean, take tomorrow, for example.

01:32:56.363 --> 01:32:58.449
Tomorrow I wouldn't bet against me.

01:32:58.657 --> 01:33:00.993
You're missing the point, kid.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.287
I already have.

01:33:10.836 --> 01:33:12.796
You can't hang on
to the game forever.

01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:16.675
You can't get back into it
from jail either.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.682
Isn't she something?

01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:25.684
Yeah, she is.

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:29.521
What every guy would give
to be in your shoes, huh?

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.527
You're standing close. I can't tell
if it's your toes I'm feeling or mine.

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:53.045
I misjudged your boy.

01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:57.132
I don't like being disappointed.

01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:02.346
Try these eclairs.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.848
I was gonna go on this little...

01:34:05.057 --> 01:34:07.810
The whipped cream's a little...
I don't like it.

01:34:08.018 --> 01:34:09.520
It's not good for my stomach.

01:34:09.728 --> 01:34:11.522
Try one of these.

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:14.066
Here. Try this.

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:17.319
Thank you.

01:34:38.048 --> 01:34:40.842
Having a great time,
take it everybody!

01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:44.054
I'll be down to get you
In a taxi, honey

01:34:44.263 --> 01:34:47.432
I'll get there
Around half past 8

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.662
You okay?

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:11.290
Roy, you okay? You okay?

01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:12.624
Where's Pop?

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:15.085
"Where's Pop?" What are you, nuts?

01:35:15.294 --> 01:35:16.461
Sit down.

01:35:20.424 --> 01:35:22.259
Get me out of here.

01:35:23.302 --> 01:35:25.304
- Let's go.
- Call a cab.

01:35:26.513 --> 01:35:27.889
Come on, come on.

01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:48.869
And how are we feeling today?

01:35:53.749 --> 01:35:55.334
Okay.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.337
Where am I?

01:35:58.754 --> 01:36:00.964
Tower Maternity, Roy.

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:02.966
I'm Dr. Newman.

01:36:03.175 --> 01:36:05.719
It was an emergency,
and we were the closest.

01:36:09.014 --> 01:36:11.725
They lost three in a row.

01:36:11.892 --> 01:36:13.185
What's done is done.

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:17.773
Am I okay to play Monday?

01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:20.317
I'm afraid there's some bad news.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:24.237
The lining of your stomach
has been gradually deteriorating...

01:36:24.446 --> 01:36:25.906
...due to a previous injury.

01:36:26.448 --> 01:36:30.118
We pumped your stomach
and came up with this.

01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:35.165
This silver bullet head has been
in your stomach for some time.

01:36:35.374 --> 01:36:36.708
Years, I would say.

01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:39.044
It doesn't matter. It's history.

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:42.798
Yes, but it could prove fatal
if you continue to play baseball.

01:36:43.382 --> 01:36:46.259
Stop now, and in time
it could heal properly.

01:36:47.094 --> 01:36:48.553
Can I play Monday?

01:36:48.762 --> 01:36:51.264
The odds and your age
would be against you.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:56.770
One day, your stomach could easily
blow apart, kill you on the spot.

01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:00.941
I'm sorry.

01:37:04.236 --> 01:37:06.863
Roy Hobbs, New York Knights' star,
is laid up...

01:37:07.072 --> 01:37:09.700
...at Tower Maternity Hospital
in New York City.

01:37:09.908 --> 01:37:13.286
The full nature and extent
of his illness is as yet undisclosed.

01:37:13.495 --> 01:37:16.623
His availability for Monday's
game against Pittsburgh...

01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:19.584
...remains a question.
Turning to local news...

01:37:33.265 --> 01:37:34.766
May I come in?

01:37:40.564 --> 01:37:42.441
You must've had a snoot full.

01:37:42.733 --> 01:37:44.443
It was a great party.

01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:59.124
I heard Gus and Max
talking last night.

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:00.959
What about?

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:05.464
He said that if you played Monday
it could kill you.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:08.216
- It's a lie.
- No, it's not.

01:38:11.595 --> 01:38:13.138
You're not gonna play.

01:38:13.305 --> 01:38:15.474
Really, are you?

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.310
It would just be my last game.

01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:23.190
It's his last game.

01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:25.150
Well, that's rich.

01:38:25.317 --> 01:38:27.778
You're trying to kill yourself,
aren't you?

01:38:28.487 --> 01:38:30.489
Doc's making it out
worse than it is.

01:38:31.448 --> 01:38:34.493
Oh, he is? Sure he is.

01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:37.120
Hey, why not?

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:40.791
I look swell in black.
Don't you think I look swell in black?

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:42.459
I sure do.

01:38:44.169 --> 01:38:47.547
Why don't we just get away?
Let's just go away right now.

01:38:48.507 --> 01:38:50.258
I've been away long enough.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.344
Oh, my God.

01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:54.679
Why are you doing this?

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.681
What for?

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:59.184
Just to play one last game,
is that it?

01:38:59.768 --> 01:39:01.520
It's all I've got left.

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:03.563
Then I can walk away.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:06.983
Well, I have a small favor to ask.

01:39:08.068 --> 01:39:09.653
Walk away right now...

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:12.489
...and you'll live for sure.

01:39:12.989 --> 01:39:15.784
That way we can see
a whole lot more of each other.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:24.376
And you won't walk away
empty-handed.

01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:26.670
That's for sure.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.881
What do you mean?

01:39:32.050 --> 01:39:34.636
I mean, Gus will stake us
to a lot of money.

01:39:36.388 --> 01:39:39.599
We can buy into a company.
Everybody does that.

01:39:40.851 --> 01:39:45.397
Think what we can do, Roy.
With your name, we'll make out fine.

01:39:47.107 --> 01:39:48.733
If I skip the playoff?

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.319
Come on, Roy, you understand.

01:39:51.778 --> 01:39:54.447
You make up your mind
to have certain things.

01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:57.159
You know how it is.

01:39:58.451 --> 01:39:59.911
Yes, I do.

01:40:01.955 --> 01:40:03.290
Do you?

01:40:16.011 --> 01:40:17.929
Just a few practice swings,
that's all.

01:40:18.138 --> 01:40:19.764
Just to get back my timing.

01:40:19.973 --> 01:40:21.516
It's my ass if Pop finds out.

01:40:21.725 --> 01:40:24.060
We heard about that.
We heard about it already.

01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:27.189
Just make sure you take it easy.

01:40:27.397 --> 01:40:29.941
Roy's the money.
He gets hurt, we're out of a job!

01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:31.318
We'll take it easy.

01:40:31.526 --> 01:40:34.321
Just making a point. Take it easy.

01:40:34.529 --> 01:40:37.616
Sometimes I wonder
what I'm doing in this game.

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:39.951
How do I get myself
in situations like this?

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.787
Diz, I think maybe
we heard that a couple of times.

01:40:42.996 --> 01:40:46.791
He's always saying that. Don't know
about you, but he's making me nuts!

01:40:49.294 --> 01:40:50.795
All right, here we go.

01:40:56.301 --> 01:40:57.677
Come on, Diz.

01:41:06.186 --> 01:41:07.979
You get that, Max?

01:41:09.147 --> 01:41:11.483
Don't ever look back, Max! Ever!

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:20.033
- Roy. Diz!
- Oh, my God.

01:41:22.786 --> 01:41:24.496
Can you stand? Roy?

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:29.251
- We should've had more sense!
- It's all right. No one will know.

01:41:29.459 --> 01:41:31.086
No one's gonna know.

01:41:31.294 --> 01:41:32.295
Take it easy.

01:41:32.879 --> 01:41:34.881
We better get you
back to the hospital.

01:41:49.062 --> 01:41:50.188
Who's there?

01:41:50.355 --> 01:41:52.065
Don't be alarmed.

01:41:54.526 --> 01:41:57.320
I understand that you are playing.

01:41:58.863 --> 01:42:01.783
- I wouldn't want you to dock my pay.
- On the contrary.

01:42:01.992 --> 01:42:05.870
I wish to augment it with a bonus.

01:42:06.705 --> 01:42:10.542
Now, as you may know,
we are favored to win.

01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:13.878
Which puts you back
working night court.

01:42:14.087 --> 01:42:17.215
I have decided that
would be a grave mistake.

01:42:17.549 --> 01:42:22.012
Now, financially speaking,
I can do better by not winning.

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.555
With your help, of course.

01:42:24.014 --> 01:42:25.932
You put that in writing for Pop.

01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:30.437
Now, as you may know, the prevailing
rate for this sort of thing...

01:42:30.645 --> 01:42:32.439
...is $10,000.

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:34.899
I'm offering you twice that.

01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:37.110
You're wasting your time.

01:42:37.319 --> 01:42:40.572
You know as well as I do that
you're in no condition to play.

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.700
Then why the 20,000?

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:45.535
Insurance.

01:42:47.412 --> 01:42:49.164
You could get into the game.

01:42:49.372 --> 01:42:52.542
You could wreck it
with an unexpected blow.

01:42:54.586 --> 01:42:55.920
That'd be the beauty of it.

01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:58.590
It's a monumental mistake, Hobbs...

01:42:59.174 --> 01:43:04.095
...in light of certain information
that I now possess.

01:43:05.764 --> 01:43:07.640
Police photographs...

01:43:08.433 --> 01:43:11.561
...taken 15 years ago...

01:43:12.228 --> 01:43:13.938
...in a hotel room.

01:43:15.065 --> 01:43:16.483
By the way...

01:43:16.983 --> 01:43:18.360
...that's you.

01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:20.945
A nice young boy.

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:23.281
Half-naked lady...

01:43:23.573 --> 01:43:25.116
...lying in the street.

01:43:25.325 --> 01:43:28.912
You, in her room, shot.

01:43:29.829 --> 01:43:31.247
Nasty business.

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:32.791
Mercy.

01:43:32.957 --> 01:43:37.003
Full disclosure of this scandal in the
eyes of your admirers and loved ones...

01:43:37.212 --> 01:43:41.466
...could only cause humiliation.
Embarrassment.

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:43.968
It was suicide.

01:43:44.177 --> 01:43:46.554
Oh, Mr. Hobbs...

01:43:47.472 --> 01:43:50.183
...if kids should see this...

01:43:51.851 --> 01:43:54.479
Now, it's a surprisingly
simple procedure.

01:43:55.105 --> 01:43:58.316
You're to play your normal game,
except when you are at bat.

01:43:58.525 --> 01:44:02.320
And then, under no circumstances,
are you to hit the ball safely.

01:44:02.987 --> 01:44:04.489
They'll beat you without me.

01:44:04.781 --> 01:44:07.617
Without you, they lost three in a row.

01:44:08.535 --> 01:44:13.331
What is more, I have a contingency
plan for their flat failure.

01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:16.459
Who else is in on this?

01:44:17.293 --> 01:44:18.545
A key man.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.682
Good night, Mr. Hobbs.

01:44:47.198 --> 01:44:48.783
Here's another. Listen.

01:44:48.992 --> 01:44:53.037
"We love to watch you hit that ball.
We cheer when you're connecting.

01:44:53.246 --> 01:44:57.542
But it really shocked us, one and all,
to hear that you're expecting."

01:44:58.418 --> 01:45:00.336
Hold it. I didn't write those lines.

01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:02.422
I didn't think you could read.

01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:05.675
The babies. Please!

01:45:05.884 --> 01:45:07.051
What about the babies?

01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:10.221
How would you like
to wake up to this?

01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:13.016
I can't have this noise.
You're disturbing the mothers.

01:45:13.224 --> 01:45:14.767
I guess that's you, guys.

01:45:15.727 --> 01:45:17.228
Get well quick.

01:45:17.854 --> 01:45:20.356
You just go out there
and play great ball.

01:45:20.523 --> 01:45:21.566
Take care.

01:45:23.568 --> 01:45:25.445
Get well. We need you. Take care.

01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:29.991
Look out on the way out.
Just keep your eyes straight ahead.

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:32.785
It's gonna be tough without you, Roy.

01:45:32.994 --> 01:45:34.329
Thanks, Diz.

01:45:50.428 --> 01:45:52.180
Miss! Miss.

01:45:52.347 --> 01:45:55.642
Hi, I'm Max Mercy, sports columnist
for The Daily Mirror.

01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:58.353
I saw your picture in the paper.
Very nice.

01:45:58.561 --> 01:46:03.066
Roy and I go back a long way.
I wonder if you'll help me a little on this.

01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:07.570
See, I need a little help
if you could give some.

01:46:07.779 --> 01:46:10.448
For Roy's defense, okay?

01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:13.576
Now, you know this woman?
You know what happened?

01:46:15.203 --> 01:46:18.623
Anything to do with a love quarrel?

01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:22.460
You might have known her,
she knew you, a love triangle?

01:46:23.086 --> 01:46:24.796
A bad joke.

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:29.634
I thought you might be able
to help us with some little clue.

01:46:31.803 --> 01:46:34.973
I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep this story from breaking.

01:46:36.724 --> 01:46:37.809
Hey, miss?

01:46:53.074 --> 01:46:54.951
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:46:58.788 --> 01:47:00.039
Is there...

01:47:01.666 --> 01:47:02.792
...a chair?

01:47:10.383 --> 01:47:12.635
Doc says I have to quit baseball.

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:15.513
Why?

01:47:20.393 --> 01:47:23.313
Some mistakes I guess
we never stop paying for.

01:47:30.236 --> 01:47:31.821
I didn't even know her.

01:47:33.239 --> 01:47:34.407
The girl on the train?

01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:43.750
You liked her, didn't you?

01:47:46.919 --> 01:47:48.046
Yes.

01:47:51.883 --> 01:47:53.217
But I didn't see it coming.

01:47:54.135 --> 01:47:57.388
How could you know she'd hurt you?
How could anyone?

01:47:58.514 --> 01:48:00.641
- I didn't see it coming.
- You should've?

01:48:00.850 --> 01:48:02.477
Yes.

01:48:02.643 --> 01:48:04.103
But I didn't.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.065
Why didn't I?

01:48:09.275 --> 01:48:11.027
You were so young.

01:48:21.412 --> 01:48:23.122
Things sure turned out different.

01:48:23.748 --> 01:48:24.874
In what way?

01:48:25.917 --> 01:48:27.126
Different.

01:48:30.171 --> 01:48:34.675
For 16 years, I've lived
with the idea that I could be...

01:48:34.884 --> 01:48:36.386
...the best in the game.

01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:39.722
You're so good now!

01:48:39.972 --> 01:48:41.683
I could've been better.

01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:46.437
I could've broke
every record in the book.

01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:48.481
And then?

01:48:49.607 --> 01:48:51.234
"And then"?

01:48:52.944 --> 01:48:55.780
When I walked down the street,
people would've said:

01:48:55.988 --> 01:49:00.118
"There goes Roy Hobbs, the best
there ever was in this game."

01:49:11.087 --> 01:49:13.673
You know,
I believe we have two lives.

01:49:15.341 --> 01:49:16.759
How? What do you mean?

01:49:17.677 --> 01:49:21.973
The life we learn with and
the life we live with after that.

01:49:24.267 --> 01:49:25.977
With or without the records...

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:28.688
...they'll remember you.

01:49:30.982 --> 01:49:35.319
Think of all those young boys
you've influenced.

01:49:35.528 --> 01:49:37.613
There are so many of them.

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:44.871
That day in Chicago,
why did you stand up?

01:49:45.663 --> 01:49:48.040
I didn't want to see you fail.

01:49:56.382 --> 01:49:58.176
I wish Dad could've...

01:50:03.014 --> 01:50:05.016
God, I love baseball.

01:50:13.524 --> 01:50:15.568
Are you gonna
go to the game tomorrow?

01:50:17.028 --> 01:50:18.237
Yeah.

01:50:21.157 --> 01:50:22.366
Is your son with you?

01:50:25.912 --> 01:50:27.330
He is.

01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:34.670
Excuse me.

01:50:45.598 --> 01:50:47.767
Well, I gotta go.

01:51:29.183 --> 01:51:32.436
Tomorrow, after we've lost...

01:51:32.979 --> 01:51:36.232
...I want Pop Fisher out of here,
bag and baggage.

01:51:36.607 --> 01:51:38.734
That's right. Lay it all
on the line, Harry.

01:51:38.943 --> 01:51:40.778
All of it.
That's right. You heard me.

01:51:48.077 --> 01:51:49.078
I'll call back.

01:51:52.123 --> 01:51:53.416
Slugger, you okay?

01:51:54.917 --> 01:51:55.960
I'm fine.

01:51:56.168 --> 01:51:58.462
- You look a little lost.
- I'm not.

01:52:02.675 --> 01:52:04.760
You dropped this on your way out.

01:52:06.929 --> 01:52:08.139
Something seems amiss.

01:52:08.306 --> 01:52:11.017
Correct me if I'm wrong, Hobbs,
but we had a deal.

01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:13.728
No.

01:52:15.313 --> 01:52:16.772
Those are your winnings.

01:52:16.981 --> 01:52:18.983
This is a gag.
Pick it up. Get out.

01:52:19.191 --> 01:52:22.612
If it isn't enough money,
tell us what you've got in mind.

01:52:22.778 --> 01:52:24.822
To hit away.

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:28.659
I thought I could rely on your honor.

01:52:28.826 --> 01:52:30.328
You're about to.

01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:32.955
You're a foolish, foolish man.

01:52:33.164 --> 01:52:35.207
You've forgotten something.

01:52:36.459 --> 01:52:39.545
- Your past.
- I don't care. Go on.

01:52:39.795 --> 01:52:41.297
Get on the phone.

01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.466
No.

01:52:43.633 --> 01:52:45.676
That won't be necessary.

01:52:46.427 --> 01:52:48.137
I like the action.

01:52:52.183 --> 01:52:54.018
Then let it ride.

01:52:56.187 --> 01:52:57.563
You bastard!

01:53:10.493 --> 01:53:11.869
I hate you.

01:53:21.045 --> 01:53:22.380
I hate you.

01:53:31.138 --> 01:53:32.765
You were right, Memo.

01:53:34.392 --> 01:53:36.143
We have met before.

01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:41.524
You're a lot weaker than I thought.
What do you think this changes?

01:53:42.483 --> 01:53:46.612
Have Max draw you a picture. You can
read about it in the morning paper.

01:53:47.488 --> 01:53:49.740
You're yesterday's news, kid.

01:53:50.282 --> 01:53:53.077
You had a great gift, a talent.
But it's not enough.

01:53:57.957 --> 01:53:59.750
I think you're a loser.

01:54:10.678 --> 01:54:12.430
You can't let him go.

01:54:13.305 --> 01:54:15.433
Roy.

01:54:15.599 --> 01:54:17.101
Relax.

01:54:17.309 --> 01:54:21.022
With his insides, he's as good
to us now as he was before.

01:54:22.106 --> 01:54:24.608
Besides, we're $20,000 richer.

01:54:35.161 --> 01:54:36.662
I wanted to win that pennant...

01:54:36.829 --> 01:54:39.373
...worse than I wanted
any goddamned thing in my life.

01:54:39.582 --> 01:54:42.877
You'd think I could
just this once, wouldn't you?

01:54:43.961 --> 01:54:46.589
I didn't care nothing
about the Series.

01:54:47.131 --> 01:54:50.509
Win or lose,
I would have been satisfied.

01:54:50.885 --> 01:54:54.597
I'd have walked away from baseball
and I'd have bought a farm.

01:54:55.806 --> 01:54:57.475
Nothing like a farm.

01:55:01.562 --> 01:55:04.315
Nothing like being around animals,
fixing things.

01:55:04.482 --> 01:55:09.195
There's nothing like being in the field
with the corn and the winter wheat.

01:55:13.824 --> 01:55:15.701
The greenest stuff you ever saw.

01:55:17.244 --> 01:55:20.289
You know, my mother told me
I ought to be a farmer.

01:55:23.834 --> 01:55:26.253
My dad wanted me to be
a baseball player.

01:55:28.714 --> 01:55:31.175
You're better than
anyone I ever had.

01:55:32.843 --> 01:55:35.346
And you're the best
goddamned hitter I ever saw.

01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:40.851
Suit up.

01:55:48.943 --> 01:55:50.528
This is your announcer, Jim Bauer.

01:55:50.694 --> 01:55:52.363
What a game we have for you
tonight.

01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:54.907
The Pittsburgh Pirates versus
the New York Knights...

01:55:55.074 --> 01:55:57.785
...in a playoff game to decide
the National League pennant.

01:55:57.952 --> 01:56:00.913
The fans are pouring in
to Knights Field...

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:03.457
...which will be bursting
at the seams.

01:56:03.624 --> 01:56:05.918
Who would've imagined
midway through the season...

01:56:06.085 --> 01:56:09.547
...that Pop Fisher's perennial
also-rans would be facing...

01:56:18.556 --> 01:56:20.724
Still dogging me, huh, Max?

01:56:22.268 --> 01:56:23.644
End of the road, Hobbs.

01:56:23.853 --> 01:56:26.272
You wanna hear what I think
our chances are?

01:56:26.814 --> 01:56:28.566
You read my mind.

01:56:29.441 --> 01:56:31.110
That takes all of three seconds.

01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:35.739
They come and they go, Hobbs.
They come and they go.

01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:39.201
I'll be around here longer
than you or anybody else here.

01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:41.579
I'm here to protect this game.

01:56:43.247 --> 01:56:44.582
Whose game?

01:56:45.583 --> 01:56:49.253
I do it by making
or breaking the likes of you.

01:56:50.337 --> 01:56:52.423
Did you ever play ball, Max?

01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:59.430
No, never have.

01:56:59.763 --> 01:57:02.474
But I make it a little
more fun to watch, you see.

01:57:02.683 --> 01:57:05.436
And after today, whether
you're a goat or a hero...

01:57:05.603 --> 01:57:07.938
...you're gonna make me
a great story.

01:57:11.358 --> 01:57:12.526
See you around.

01:57:21.076 --> 01:57:23.954
And here come the New York Knights
as they take the field.

01:57:24.163 --> 01:57:27.833
Everyone will have their eyes on
Hobbs, whose illness came close...

01:57:28.042 --> 01:57:30.419
...to shattering
the Knights' dream of a pennant.

01:57:30.628 --> 01:57:33.297
Hobbs moving to his position
in right field.

01:57:33.464 --> 01:57:37.509
And just listen to that crowd
go wild for Hobbs!

01:57:39.511 --> 01:57:41.430
Unbelievable!

01:57:50.356 --> 01:57:51.815
Let's go, Knights!

01:57:51.982 --> 01:57:54.276
He looks like he's set
and ready to go.

01:57:54.485 --> 01:57:57.321
This is for the National
League Pennant!

01:57:57.488 --> 01:58:00.824
The Knights versus Pittsburgh!
The playoff game!

01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:02.034
Play ball!

01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:06.789
Al Fowler on the mound. 2 outs as
he faces Schaffer. The pitch!

01:58:07.498 --> 01:58:11.710
Schaffer swings! Fly ball going out
over the field! Hobbs goes back fast!

01:58:18.842 --> 01:58:21.595
The Pirates go down 1-2-3
in the 1st inning.

01:58:21.804 --> 01:58:23.138
- Feel okay?
- Yeah.

01:58:23.305 --> 01:58:27.351
Bivens going in against Youngberry.
Youngberry, excellent control.

01:58:27.643 --> 01:58:30.145
18 and 9 on the season.
The pitch!

01:58:30.688 --> 01:58:33.148
Strike 3, inside corner!

01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:37.569
Now batting, number 18, John Olsen.

01:58:38.696 --> 01:58:40.239
Come on, Roy!

01:58:42.533 --> 01:58:44.785
And strike 1 on Olsen.

01:58:46.537 --> 01:58:47.579
Strike 21

01:58:47.746 --> 01:58:51.834
Hobbs kneels next to Bobby Savoy,
the batboy for the Knights.

01:58:53.210 --> 01:58:55.754
Strike 3! Olsen badly fooled!

01:58:55.963 --> 01:58:59.383
Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!

01:58:59.675 --> 01:59:01.010
Come on, Roy!

01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:04.430
And listen to that chant!
The Roy Hobbs chant!

01:59:04.638 --> 01:59:06.306
Hobbs batting.

01:59:06.473 --> 01:59:10.644
Roy! Roy! Roy!

01:59:18.777 --> 01:59:20.738
Hobbs bats against Youngberry.

01:59:21.405 --> 01:59:22.406
Youngberry...

01:59:22.614 --> 01:59:25.409
...who made fifth place this year.
Here's the pitch!

01:59:25.576 --> 01:59:26.744
Swung on and missed!

01:59:27.161 --> 01:59:29.079
Hobbs fooled by that pitch.

01:59:29.246 --> 01:59:31.749
Now stepping back to the plate.
Youngberry gets set.

01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:34.877
Hobbs has been 3 for 6
so far this season.

01:59:35.085 --> 01:59:37.296
Youngberry looking in for the sign.

01:59:37.504 --> 01:59:39.631
He goes to the wind-up.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.924
The pitch!

01:59:41.091 --> 01:59:44.636
Inside corner, strike 21 The
crowd was not happy with the pitch.

01:59:44.845 --> 01:59:46.013
An excellent call.

01:59:46.221 --> 01:59:50.809
Youngberry looks in once again.
Hobbs sets himself. The concentration.

01:59:51.018 --> 01:59:52.811
Youngberry to the wind-up.
The pitch!

01:59:53.979 --> 01:59:55.981
Strike 31
Hobbs is out of there.

01:59:56.774 --> 01:59:59.943
And so at the end of 1 inning,
no score at all.

02:00:00.152 --> 02:00:03.322
The big question is whether or not
Hobbs can get his timing back.

02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:07.951
After a four-day layoff, it's difficult
for a hitter to step into the game.

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:12.831
Hobbs came directly to the field with
no batting practice this afternoon.

02:00:14.374 --> 02:00:16.293
At the end of 3 innings,
no score.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:20.756
Fowler looking in against Boyle.
Boyle, the count, 3 and 1.

02:00:21.465 --> 02:00:23.842
The pitch! And he walks.

02:00:28.138 --> 02:00:30.849
Terrific so far this afternoon.
Here comes Allen.

02:00:31.683 --> 02:00:35.646
Allen's last time up grounded
out to 1st base. Fowler looking in.

02:00:35.813 --> 02:00:37.314
Boyle over on 1st base.

02:00:37.856 --> 02:00:39.817
Allen has good power.

02:00:44.154 --> 02:00:45.697
Allen swings! Fly ball!

02:00:45.906 --> 02:00:47.866
Back, back! Hobbs drifting back.

02:00:48.075 --> 02:00:51.537
That's out of here!
Home run for Allen!

02:00:51.703 --> 02:00:53.372
The score is 2 to nothing.

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.165
Pittsburgh strikes first.

02:00:57.334 --> 02:01:01.046
Fowler up until this point
has been absolutely outstanding.

02:01:01.255 --> 02:01:04.758
That one got away from him.
Fowler not happy with it at all.

02:01:07.845 --> 02:01:10.639
You can feel the anxiety
spreading through this crowd.

02:01:10.848 --> 02:01:12.182
Time!

02:01:12.349 --> 02:01:14.059
This is a little unusual.

02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:18.313
Roy Hobbs has called time out
and is heading in to see Fowler.

02:01:19.231 --> 02:01:21.483
It's kind of an unusual situation.

02:01:23.277 --> 02:01:24.403
Play ball!

02:01:26.697 --> 02:01:30.200
- Don't do it.
- lf this is for show, you can cut the crap.

02:01:33.745 --> 02:01:35.664
Give them the real stuff, Al.

02:01:36.206 --> 02:01:38.208
I'll start pitching
when you start hitting.

02:01:40.711 --> 02:01:42.045
What the hell's going on?

02:01:42.796 --> 02:01:45.382
- It's a surprise.
- It's okay, Pop.

02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:47.384
Let's play ball.

02:01:57.936 --> 02:02:00.022
2 to nothing,
the Knights at bat.

02:02:00.397 --> 02:02:02.816
- This is it, Roy!
- Swing it, Hobbs!

02:02:03.567 --> 02:02:07.404
Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!

02:02:11.533 --> 02:02:12.576
Come on, Roy!

02:02:16.705 --> 02:02:18.457
Youngberry, the pitch!

02:02:19.333 --> 02:02:21.752
A swing and a miss.
Hobbs misses.

02:02:22.586 --> 02:02:24.755
Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!

02:02:27.591 --> 02:02:30.552
Strike 31
Hobbs falls to the ground!

02:02:31.178 --> 02:02:34.932
Hobbs tried and missed it.
Knocked him to the ground.

02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:37.976
Picks himself up again.
Youngberry overpowering.

02:02:38.185 --> 02:02:41.939
Hobbs just hasn't been able
to put it together this evening.

02:02:43.273 --> 02:02:45.359
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

02:02:45.567 --> 02:02:46.944
Excuse me.

02:02:48.946 --> 02:02:50.447
It's all right, slugger!

02:02:50.656 --> 02:02:52.115
Come on, Hobbs!

02:02:52.574 --> 02:02:54.952
It's important
that Roy Hobbs gets this.

02:02:55.118 --> 02:02:56.536
I just can't do that.

02:02:56.745 --> 02:03:01.583
I know. I have his son in the stands.
He doesn't know his son is here.

02:03:01.792 --> 02:03:04.670
- I can't do it.
- Please. I don't know what to say.

02:03:05.796 --> 02:03:09.967
At the end of 6 innings,
no score at all for the Knights.

02:03:17.641 --> 02:03:21.311
At the end of 6 innings,
again, 2 to nothing.

02:03:21.478 --> 02:03:23.146
The Knights still...

02:04:49.399 --> 02:04:53.070
LaJong hits the ball into the field!
Here comes the throw!

02:04:53.236 --> 02:04:55.280
And Frenchie is out of there!

02:04:55.489 --> 02:04:59.117
Shouldn't have gone for two.
He's trying to get something started.

02:04:59.326 --> 02:05:02.412
At the end of 7,
2 to nothing, Pittsburgh.

02:05:02.996 --> 02:05:05.749
Fowler's been overpowering
ever since the 4th inning.

02:05:05.957 --> 02:05:07.584
Getting himself set on the mound.

02:05:07.793 --> 02:05:10.087
Fowler looking in against Yancey.
The pitch!

02:05:10.295 --> 02:05:12.631
Throw, swing and a miss!
Strike 3!

02:05:12.839 --> 02:05:16.635
At the top half of the 9th,
still 2 to nothing.

02:05:16.843 --> 02:05:20.931
Two outs right now. Bivens going
back to get himself another bat.

02:05:21.139 --> 02:05:25.268
Nothing has worked so far.
Maybe he'll try another one. Bivens...

02:05:25.477 --> 02:05:27.813
...Ofor 2 today. The pitch!

02:05:28.105 --> 02:05:29.940
There's the shot over the right field!

02:05:31.108 --> 02:05:33.610
Allen picks it up.
He's throwing it!

02:05:33.819 --> 02:05:35.612
There's the throw! He is safe!

02:05:41.201 --> 02:05:42.244
Two outs!

02:05:57.509 --> 02:06:00.220
I'm telling you,
what a game we have tonight!

02:06:00.429 --> 02:06:03.640
From the stretch,
Youngberry looks...

02:06:03.849 --> 02:06:05.016
The pitch!

02:06:05.225 --> 02:06:07.644
Olsen swings!
Ground down to 3rd base!

02:06:09.521 --> 02:06:11.314
Run, you son of a bitch! Run!

02:06:13.692 --> 02:06:16.153
The ball rolls free!
Bivens takes 3rd!

02:06:21.158 --> 02:06:25.162
Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs.

02:06:25.328 --> 02:06:28.999
Roy! Roy! Roy!

02:06:38.383 --> 02:06:40.302
Come on, Roy!

02:06:54.691 --> 02:06:56.067
The pitch!

02:07:03.825 --> 02:07:06.953
Hobbs has been
an outstanding player all year!

02:07:11.708 --> 02:07:14.044
Youngberry! The pitch again!

02:07:15.462 --> 02:07:17.214
Time!

02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:19.758
Time out. Heading for the mound.

02:07:20.383 --> 02:07:24.346
That may be it for Youngberry.
Taking no chances at all. That's it.

02:07:24.554 --> 02:07:29.017
He's gonna go for a left-hander.
Youngberry not happy at all about this.

02:07:29.226 --> 02:07:32.062
Youngberry has only given up
3 hits in the entire game.

02:07:32.395 --> 02:07:34.189
A beautiful pitching performance.

02:07:34.397 --> 02:07:35.398
Let's go!

02:07:35.607 --> 02:07:38.068
Young John Rhoades
strides to the mound.

02:07:38.276 --> 02:07:42.405
A Nebraska farm boy,
blazing left-handed speed.

02:07:42.614 --> 02:07:45.659
The Pirate organization expects
great things for him.

02:07:45.867 --> 02:07:47.577
You can hit it!

02:07:47.786 --> 02:07:52.123
They say he's got the best fastball
in the major leagues right now.

02:07:54.167 --> 02:07:56.294
This is the game for the World Series.

02:07:56.503 --> 02:08:00.757
One of these teams will be, tomorrow,
playing in the World Series.

02:08:00.966 --> 02:08:02.425
It comes down to this.

02:08:11.101 --> 02:08:14.396
Hobbs, with determination,
trying to make it happen.

02:08:16.106 --> 02:08:17.607
The pitch! He swings!

02:08:17.816 --> 02:08:19.317
Oh, my God!

02:08:19.526 --> 02:08:22.445
He's trying to destroy
the press box right next to us!

02:08:22.612 --> 02:08:26.324
Absolutely broke the glass
right next to our radio booth here!

02:08:41.506 --> 02:08:43.466
Strike!

02:08:56.021 --> 02:08:58.440
This is it!
This is the game right now.

02:08:58.648 --> 02:09:01.651
Hobbs is at the bat still.
He brought them this far.

02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:05.780
Will he take them all the way?
The pitch! Hobbs hits!

02:09:06.489 --> 02:09:09.284
Fading, fading, it's a foul ball!

02:09:26.509 --> 02:09:28.053
Let's go!

02:09:41.733 --> 02:09:43.360
Pick me out a winner, Bobby.

02:09:43.526 --> 02:09:46.154
Okay.

02:10:12.597 --> 02:10:13.932
Come on, Roy!

02:10:34.744 --> 02:10:37.914
Roy! Roy! Roy!

02:10:54.305 --> 02:10:56.599
Roy, are you all right, fella?

02:10:59.310 --> 02:11:00.520
Let's play ball.

02:11:28.631 --> 02:11:31.009
You can do it! You can do it!
Out of here, Roy!

02:11:35.513 --> 02:11:36.973
Come on, one time!

02:11:38.641 --> 02:11:40.185
Attaboy, Roy!

02:11:54.365 --> 02:11:57.577
And it's spinning way
back up, high over the right field!

02:11:57.786 --> 02:12:01.664
That ball is still going!
It's way back, high up in the air!

02:12:02.332 --> 02:12:04.542
He did it! Hobbs did it!

02:12:05.305 --> 02:12:11.576
