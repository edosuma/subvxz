01:32.830 --> 01:35.610
So sorry to do this, Mr. and Mrs. Gallup.

01:35.733 --> 01:38.182
But I need to ask a few questions.

02:02.761 --> 02:07.243
Honey, I really gotta pee,
you gotta hurry, Ray.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.488
I gotta go, now.

02:10.268 --> 02:13.349
I'm gonna piss my pants
in the seat right now.

02:16.776 --> 02:18.584
- You want me to go in with you?
- No.

02:18.664 --> 02:20.765
Wait, wait, um...

02:20.845 --> 02:24.287
- ...what do you wanna do about dinner?
- Get away from me.

02:43.503 --> 02:46.411
Want me to stop and get some coffee?

02:46.491 --> 02:48.835
No. I'm gonna take a nap.

02:49.575 --> 02:52.655
- You okay?
- Yeah, just tired.

03:11.529 --> 03:13.409
I love you, Maggie.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.247
Hello?

04:57.569 --> 04:59.862
Ben? It's Ray.

05:07.363 --> 05:09.402
Maybe he had an emergency.

05:09.482 --> 05:12.529
Yeah, maybe. The signs are on.

05:26.164 --> 05:28.210
It looked bigger in the pictures.

05:29.735 --> 05:32.182
Big as it needs to be, I guess.

05:38.043 --> 05:39.589
Hmm.

05:56.127 --> 05:57.974
It's all yours.

06:16.882 --> 06:20.630
I can't believe, he'd leave the key
out where anyone could just...

06:24.372 --> 06:27.613
- Babe, where you going?
- Huh? To get the stuff.

06:27.693 --> 06:30.715
- Well, you don't have to do that now.
- I'm not gonna leave it out there overnight.

06:30.795 --> 06:34.669
- Fine, let's just get it over with.
- No, no, I can do it. You go on to bed.

06:34.749 --> 06:37.247
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

09:02.348 --> 09:05.202
- Hello?
- Hey, Ray, man, you made it.

09:05.282 --> 09:08.287
Ah, that's good, that's good.
You found the keys?

09:08.367 --> 09:09.834
You just left it outside.

09:09.914 --> 09:13.004
Oh, yeah, I just wanted
to make sure you got in okay.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.537
How do you like the place? Pretty sweet, huh?

09:15.617 --> 09:18.633
Well, the microwave, it's... it's not...

09:18.763 --> 09:21.319
Oh, don't worry, I got that taken care of.

09:21.399 --> 09:24.677
You see by the phone?
I left a card with all the numbers.

09:24.757 --> 09:26.926
I think so. Numbers?

09:27.006 --> 09:30.094
All the vendors, the vendors.

09:30.174 --> 09:33.405
You don't really need
anything else, so good luck.

09:33.485 --> 09:37.936
Wait, so I don't have an email
on you, or a cellphone?

09:38.016 --> 09:41.440
If something comes up,
is there something wrong?

09:41.520 --> 09:45.298
Fuck no, man, nothing like that. I mean...

09:45.643 --> 09:49.124
...the place is yours. I gotta tell you,
you guys are gonna love it.

09:49.204 --> 09:50.881
- Wait.
- Look it...

09:50.961 --> 09:55.929
You can handle this, I promise.
Just keep it simple. I gotta go.

10:14.418 --> 10:16.213
Ava, right?

10:16.293 --> 10:18.700
Uh, I'm Ray, the new owner.

10:19.391 --> 10:23.415
Yeah, so I'm Ray, my wife Maggie, she's...

10:23.495 --> 10:25.907
- ...well, you'll meet her.
- Okay.

10:26.630 --> 10:28.909
Oh, strange how cold it can get
out in the desert, huh?

10:28.989 --> 10:31.656
- Uh-huh.
- Who's he?

10:31.736 --> 10:33.783
He's my nephew.

10:35.907 --> 10:39.554
Alright, well, if you need anything. Just...

10:40.045 --> 10:42.115
- Okay.
- Alright.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.390
Who was that?

10:52.357 --> 10:54.213
It's just the cleaning lady.

10:54.993 --> 10:56.815
She wasn't very talkative.

10:57.695 --> 11:00.852
Mm, I guess we're gonna have
to wake up early from now on.

11:00.932 --> 11:03.556
You don't have to, I'll let her in.

11:04.036 --> 11:05.872
I'll get her a key.

11:07.439 --> 11:11.044
- You were gone for hours last night.
- I know.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.498
I was already asleep.

11:13.578 --> 11:15.793
I know, I was just...

11:15.873 --> 11:19.118
...just a little restless thinking
of everything we have to do here.

11:56.988 --> 11:58.544
Hey!

11:59.424 --> 12:01.914
Ow! Ow! Oh, that hurt!

12:01.994 --> 12:03.830
- It hurt?
- Yeah.

12:44.935 --> 12:48.341
Babe, can you grab us a new
frying pan when you're in town?

12:51.910 --> 12:55.066
Not a lot of room in these cabinets either.

12:55.146 --> 12:58.837
I'd call Ben and complain
but his number's been disconnected.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.439
Really?

13:00.619 --> 13:02.440
That's weird.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.791
- Maybe he changed it.
- Yeah, maybe.

13:34.853 --> 13:38.477
Maybe, I'll get a little frame
for those while I'm out.

13:39.157 --> 13:40.993
That'd be nice.

13:54.039 --> 13:55.908
Thank you.

14:08.018 --> 14:09.887
A key.

15:48.953 --> 15:52.433
- Somebody here?
- Our first guest, I put her in room six.

15:52.513 --> 15:55.652
Whoa, I thought we were gonna
wait to go official tomorrow.

15:55.732 --> 15:59.484
So, we're a soft launch, it's okay.
I felt bad for her, she looked tired.

15:59.564 --> 16:02.754
- Yeah, okay.
- At first, I was really nervous...

16:02.834 --> 16:06.757
...but then I did the whole registration
thing, I took the cash, it was cool.

16:06.837 --> 16:10.159
- So, who's the guest?
- I don't know, some woman.

16:10.239 --> 16:12.529
And... by herself?

16:12.609 --> 16:16.014
As far as I could tell.
She said she needed to sleep.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.670
This all feels really good to me, Ray.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.774
I... once business picks up...

16:22.854 --> 16:24.675
...I think we're gonna be
real comfortable here.

16:24.755 --> 16:27.559
Yeah. Good, me too.

16:30.061 --> 16:33.132
- You want a beer?
- No, I'm okay.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.785
Oh, hey, you must be the new boss man.

17:08.265 --> 17:10.321
Something like that. I'm Ray.

17:10.402 --> 17:13.038
Hey, Ray, how are you? I'm Tommy.

17:14.071 --> 17:18.943
Nice thing about my rig being so loud is I
don't need to ring that damn buzzer, do I?

17:20.744 --> 17:23.487
- I'll take number ten if it's free.
- It is.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.417
Ah, good.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.977
My lucky day, huh?

17:29.020 --> 17:31.290
Yes. Just kidding.

17:32.255 --> 17:34.444
- Here.
- Oh.

17:34.524 --> 17:36.047
And...

17:36.127 --> 17:38.116
...I won't be needing this...

17:38.196 --> 17:40.800
...because I'm pretty much
the regular around here.

17:43.701 --> 17:46.190
But then again you don't know me
from a damn hole in the ground...

17:46.270 --> 17:47.792
...so how about I put my name down here.

17:47.872 --> 17:49.342
Yeah.

17:54.845 --> 17:57.589
- Still 35 even?
- Works for me.

17:58.616 --> 18:02.054
Good. I like things that don't change.

18:11.228 --> 18:14.017
Oh, no, that's a gratuity.

18:14.097 --> 18:16.287
Just help us get off
on the right foot, you know.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.969
No. Thanks, but it's not necessary.

18:19.049 --> 18:21.293
I know you're just getting started.

18:21.373 --> 18:23.096
Try in your pocket.

18:25.477 --> 18:27.679
Thanks, but really.

18:28.212 --> 18:29.649
Good night, Ray.

20:51.122 --> 20:53.010
Stopped in Laughlin. You know that place?

20:53.090 --> 20:55.895
Oh, yeah, it's for people
who can't get to Vegas.

22:23.214 --> 22:24.580
What the hell?

24:17.031 --> 24:18.597
Ray?

24:20.410 --> 24:22.736
I'll trade you for whatever
you're worrying about.

24:22.816 --> 24:25.706
- It's nothing.
- Come on, Ray.

24:25.786 --> 24:28.790
Babe, really, it's nothing.

24:49.627 --> 24:51.915
Well, hey, look at that for timing, huh?

24:51.995 --> 24:53.817
Couldn't sleep anyway.

24:53.897 --> 24:58.088
Well, maybe I should give you some
of mine. I plan on getting a lot tonight.

24:58.168 --> 25:00.573
You need me to fill out one of those...

25:02.172 --> 25:04.896
Um... you know, Tommy...

25:04.976 --> 25:10.118
...I haven't really had a chance to clean
number ten yet, so how about seven?

25:10.748 --> 25:14.872
No, no, I'm good with that,
I don't mind another man's mess.

25:14.952 --> 25:16.955
You're sure, 'cause...

25:19.857 --> 25:23.062
I'm that sure. Night, buddy.

25:49.687 --> 25:51.490
I'm sleeping, baby.

27:53.211 --> 27:55.013
Where'd you go, sweetie?

27:56.005 --> 27:59.451
Just... just needed some air.

28:58.109 --> 28:59.778
Unbelievable.

29:02.478 --> 29:04.368
Someone's at the door.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.509
Hi, Ava.

29:11.589 --> 29:13.945
- Hi, mister.
- How are you this morning?

29:14.025 --> 29:17.229
- Good.
- Oh, I made you a key.

29:21.265 --> 29:24.655
Here, so you don't... you don't
have to, you know, the buzzer.

29:24.735 --> 29:27.667
- Okay, let me get...
- My wife, Maggie, um...

29:27.747 --> 29:29.695
...we just... we like to sleep in is all.

29:29.775 --> 29:32.285
Okay. Thank you, mister.

29:32.365 --> 29:34.412
You... you have a good day.

30:37.974 --> 30:41.932
Before I forget, I moved the woman
in room six to room 10.

30:42.412 --> 30:45.598
She was real nice about it,
family needed double beds.

30:46.950 --> 30:49.539
- What is this?
- What's what?

30:49.619 --> 30:53.277
Your journey toward adoption?
Jesus Christ, Maggie.

30:53.357 --> 30:55.246
It's just information, Ray.

30:55.726 --> 30:58.681
It's not like we never talked about it,
you said, once we're settled in...

30:58.761 --> 31:02.586
- This is settled in? We just got here.
- You promised me.

31:02.666 --> 31:07.190
Shit, Maggie, I need some time
for this, I can't just...

31:07.270 --> 31:08.358
Fuck, I mean...

31:08.438 --> 31:12.931
It's a piece of paper, Ray. You don't have
to pay for it, you don't have to feed it...

31:13.011 --> 31:15.528
- ...you don't even have to watch over it.
- What is that supposed to mean?

31:15.608 --> 31:18.335
When I said, I'd stay,
you promised we could do this...

31:18.415 --> 31:20.236
...and now you don't even
wanna talk about it.

31:20.316 --> 31:23.040
It's like being married
to a brick fucking wall.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.676
We came here to start over,
and everything is exactly the same...

31:26.756 --> 31:31.195
- ...it's exactly the same.
- I have a relationship with her.

31:32.195 --> 31:34.231
I talk to her every day.

31:34.897 --> 31:36.854
And you can't just...

31:36.934 --> 31:40.028
...you're not allowed to just... replace her.

31:40.270 --> 31:42.793
Don't you talk about her, I was with her.

31:42.873 --> 31:45.314
When you were off being just
fucking friends with the neighbor...

31:45.394 --> 31:49.298
- ...I was there with her!
- Yeah, you were there, you were high.

31:49.378 --> 31:53.403
You were a million miles away
when she was sitting on your lap.

31:53.483 --> 31:55.606
I'm gonna be better...

31:55.686 --> 31:57.375
...Ray.

31:59.622 --> 32:01.559
You know, fuck it.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.495
Are you happy now?

32:29.253 --> 32:33.109
Ain't you the fellow who took over that place
across the street, the Motorway?

32:33.189 --> 32:37.280
- Yeah, Motorway, right. Ray, hi.
- Hey, welcome to town, Ray.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.886
You and that young lady of yours,
you need anything at all, just let me know.

32:41.966 --> 32:44.587
Alright, appreciate that.

32:44.667 --> 32:47.411
You find you got any
ne'er-do-wells around your place...

32:47.491 --> 32:49.859
...I got a lot of friends in this town...

32:49.939 --> 32:51.496
...we can take care of that.

32:51.576 --> 32:55.499
Me and my boys, we can take care
of anything in this town.

32:55.579 --> 32:58.836
Okay, that's really cool.
You have a good night.

32:58.916 --> 33:00.722
Yeah, you too.

33:29.812 --> 33:32.285
Well, I just don't know
why you gave away 10, Ray.

33:32.365 --> 33:36.293
I told you, we needed the room.
Now five's just as good.

33:36.373 --> 33:39.589
No, I'm a loyal customer,
and you know damn well that's true.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.545
What can I do, Tommy?

33:41.625 --> 33:45.281
Well, you know, I don't wanna come in
here and shake the whole place awake...

33:45.361 --> 33:48.719
...every time I come and leave so early.
That's why I like it down there on the end.

33:48.799 --> 33:52.436
I know what you do in there. Come on, Tommy.

33:53.035 --> 33:56.039
You're not gonna tell me
those girls are your daughters?

33:59.009 --> 34:01.445
No, they're not my daughters.

34:01.945 --> 34:04.201
But I'll tell you what's the truth...

34:04.281 --> 34:06.502
...is I am a married man...

34:06.582 --> 34:10.589
...and to be honest my wife doesn't like
to get it on so much anymore and...

34:11.989 --> 34:13.710
...and I'm a sex addict.

34:13.791 --> 34:17.079
Now I read up on it, and it's a condition.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.616
As long as you pay for the room...

34:19.996 --> 34:22.833
...what you do in there is your business.

34:28.304 --> 34:30.708
As long as you're not killing anybody.

34:32.174 --> 34:34.844
No, I'm not killing anybody.

34:37.114 --> 34:40.469
Have a good night, Ray. You are a good man.

34:40.550 --> 34:42.386
Damn good fella.

38:19.569 --> 38:21.405
You're cold.

41:35.198 --> 41:37.754
Shouldn't you be watching
for customers, young lady?

41:37.834 --> 41:40.272
I can see the cars from here. I have a phone.

41:40.352 --> 41:43.241
- Yeah? I guess, you got it covered.
- Mm-hmm.

41:47.542 --> 41:50.332
You know, the number 10 key
was in the overnight drop box.

41:50.412 --> 41:54.136
Good, we can double-sell the room,
she was all paid up.

41:54.216 --> 41:56.787
- You're really taking to this, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

41:58.353 --> 42:00.410
- Ray.
- What?

42:00.490 --> 42:02.527
Nobody's watching.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.176
What are you doing?

42:12.502 --> 42:17.394
- What do you think that's about?
- I don't know, probably nothing.

42:18.342 --> 42:20.211
I'll be right back.

42:30.921 --> 42:33.409
I gotta say, this is a first.

42:33.889 --> 42:35.011
Sorry?

42:35.091 --> 42:38.515
Not smelling Ben's coffee
as soon as I step in here.

42:38.995 --> 42:42.019
He always had a full pot right over there.

42:42.099 --> 42:44.101
I'd be glad to make you some.

42:44.533 --> 42:47.790
Yeah, that'd be wonderful.
Howard Kellor, welcome neighbor.

42:47.870 --> 42:50.192
- Ray, good to meet you Howard.
- And you.

42:50.272 --> 42:51.808
Um...

42:55.011 --> 42:57.448
- That's a start.
- Plug it in.

43:02.284 --> 43:04.474
I'll... I'll be right back.

43:04.554 --> 43:06.357
Not going anywhere.

43:13.596 --> 43:14.618
What does he want?

43:14.698 --> 43:19.137
I think he just wants to welcome us to
the neighborhood. Seems like a nice guy.

43:24.341 --> 43:26.962
So old Ben finally went and sold the place.

43:27.142 --> 43:30.802
Only swore he'd do it for six years.
You a friend of his?

43:30.882 --> 43:34.237
Me? No. No. We only met after
I answered a Craigslist ad.

43:34.317 --> 43:35.956
No shit.

43:36.786 --> 43:39.565
- You usually run hotels?
- No, I'm an electrician.

43:39.645 --> 43:42.078
Carpentry, whatever I can get my hands on.

43:42.158 --> 43:44.905
I just wanted to try something
different, you know?

43:44.985 --> 43:47.984
Sure, I mean, why this?

43:48.064 --> 43:50.483
Well, I guess sometimes you...

43:50.563 --> 43:53.221
...just need a change of scenery, right?

43:54.137 --> 43:56.017
Yeah, I hear that.

43:56.697 --> 43:58.409
Yeah, I hear that.

44:00.276 --> 44:02.931
Hey, I don't suppose you know
where Ben ended up, do you?

44:03.011 --> 44:06.391
I don't, and I can't even get him on the
phone, his number's been disconnected.

44:06.471 --> 44:10.206
Yeah, and you know what, people
around here are just funny about that.

44:10.286 --> 44:14.152
They just up and leave without...
there's this RV city down the road...

44:14.232 --> 44:18.140
...and they do that all the time.
Just suddenly, boom, gone, you're like...

44:18.220 --> 44:20.807
Well, I mean, was there something
you need to see him about?

44:20.887 --> 44:24.501
No, no. I just wanna stay in touch with him.

44:27.069 --> 44:28.489
Well...

44:28.853 --> 44:30.670
...don't worry, Howard.

44:31.475 --> 44:34.897
Every morning I'll be sure
to have a fresh pot here for you.

44:34.977 --> 44:38.400
Well, that sounds like a deal.

44:40.417 --> 44:42.261
Oh, yeah.

44:42.651 --> 44:45.174
Well, hey, I won't bug you,
I just wanted to poke my head in.

44:45.254 --> 44:49.112
And, listen, if you ever need a hand
around here, I know it's the off season...

44:49.192 --> 44:51.379
...and now's the time to get stuff done,
you just come to me first.

44:51.459 --> 44:53.898
- Will do, thank you.
- Yeah.

44:55.530 --> 44:58.955
Oh, and hey, if you ever do hear from Ben...

44:59.035 --> 45:00.590
...you get his mailing address for me.

45:00.670 --> 45:03.741
- Sure thing.
- Alright. Ray.

45:23.792 --> 45:25.412
That feels good, babe.

45:27.162 --> 45:29.185
You deserve a night off.

46:25.821 --> 46:28.811
Officer, I repeat, I am fine.

46:28.891 --> 46:31.246
I only had a little bit of wine with dinner.

46:31.326 --> 46:34.583
- Oh, then walk a straight line.
- And maybe some whiskey.

46:34.663 --> 46:36.700
And a beer or two.

46:39.468 --> 46:41.757
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

46:41.837 --> 46:46.295
Mister, you've been a very bad boy.

46:46.575 --> 46:50.532
And you're gonna finish
what you started by that pool today.

46:50.612 --> 46:52.334
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

46:52.414 --> 46:56.138
Well, first I wanna get us
a couple more drinks.

46:56.218 --> 46:59.456
Okay. Copy that. Hurry up.

47:14.569 --> 47:16.139
Ray!

47:22.612 --> 47:24.148
Ray!

47:26.147 --> 47:27.968
It's a body, Ray.

47:32.688 --> 47:34.191
Ray.

47:35.091 --> 47:37.128
Ray, what the fuck is it?

47:38.661 --> 47:40.464
It's a pig.

47:44.133 --> 47:46.106
Oh, my God.

50:28.863 --> 50:31.553
Ray, where have you been, buddy?

50:32.033 --> 50:35.271
I rang a bunch of times,
but nobody opened up and let me in.

50:40.709 --> 50:43.546
Thought I was gonna have
to do it in the hot box.

50:47.482 --> 50:49.371
Is your sign busted?

50:49.551 --> 50:51.573
It says no vacancies.

50:51.653 --> 50:54.054
Ain't no cars in the parking lot.

51:00.530 --> 51:04.153
We had a little trouble here tonight, so I...

51:04.433 --> 51:06.003
Yeah?

51:06.801 --> 51:09.192
Somebody threw a dead pig in my pool.

51:09.272 --> 51:12.075
Oh, Lord. Now that's a new one.

51:12.774 --> 51:15.346
At least you got breakfast
for a few days, huh?

51:15.945 --> 51:18.567
I burned it out in the desert.

51:18.647 --> 51:21.971
Damn, Ray. You not only feed
the coyotes and the crows...

51:22.051 --> 51:24.674
...but you just cook 'em up a mess of ham?

51:24.754 --> 51:26.643
You're a hell of a guy.

51:27.423 --> 51:30.059
I gotta get back out there. But...

51:30.993 --> 51:33.998
...but we got time for a couple of nips, huh?

51:34.630 --> 51:36.333
I'm good.

51:40.303 --> 51:43.392
What did you mean about being a new one?

51:43.872 --> 51:47.005
Ben didn't tell you anything, huh?
I guess he didn't say anything to you...

51:47.085 --> 51:51.547
...'cause... 'cause he was worried about
you getting skittish on this deal.

51:51.946 --> 51:54.417
And... there was this girl.

51:55.417 --> 51:57.421
This girl was staying here.

51:58.087 --> 51:59.507
You know.

52:00.722 --> 52:04.394
And she decided to take a twilight swim.

52:05.628 --> 52:08.632
But not before she cut herself up real bad.

52:09.098 --> 52:12.529
But Ben had nothing to do with it.
It wasn't his responsibility...

52:12.609 --> 52:15.378
'cause that gate was locked.
She jumped over the gate...

52:15.458 --> 52:17.340
...bled out in the pool.

52:19.575 --> 52:24.466
Look, I gotta get back there,
I got to do my duty to my wiener.

52:25.046 --> 52:27.537
And then I'll come back
and we'll drink some more.

52:27.617 --> 52:30.220
No, I'm fine, you go on.

52:31.187 --> 52:33.257
Alright, is 10 free?

52:34.388 --> 52:36.427
Or is that 15 now?

52:41.462 --> 52:44.719
You have a good night, Ray.
I know I'm going to.

52:44.799 --> 52:46.388
Tommy.

52:46.568 --> 52:48.037
Yeah?

52:50.540 --> 52:53.195
Nothing, forget it.

52:53.275 --> 52:54.615
You have a good night.

52:55.745 --> 52:58.666
Alright, Ray. Good night, buddy.

53:30.045 --> 53:33.435
- ...little space, right?
- It is, it's beautiful out here.

53:33.515 --> 53:36.606
- There's the man right there.
- Howard.

53:37.286 --> 53:39.123
You been holding out on me, Ray.

53:40.689 --> 53:43.327
You never told me
you had such a beautiful wife.

53:44.093 --> 53:46.916
- Can I bother you for a cup of coffee?
- I don't see why not.

53:46.996 --> 53:49.827
- Great. Pleasure.
- Same here.

53:49.907 --> 53:52.320
- Hope I get to see you more.
- Yeah.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.988
Yeah.

53:54.368 --> 53:56.172
Little pick-me-up.

54:00.308 --> 54:02.779
Heard you had some weirdness here last night.

54:04.279 --> 54:06.496
- How do you mean?
- The boys over at the gas station...

54:06.576 --> 54:09.371
...said you peeled out of
your parking lot pretty fast.

54:09.451 --> 54:12.407
- Like you was on a mission.
- Oh, yeah.

54:12.487 --> 54:14.710
Somebody tossed a pig into my pool.

54:15.290 --> 54:16.745
Pig.

54:16.825 --> 54:18.661
Did you save it?

54:19.761 --> 54:22.818
Well, it was pretty dead already.

54:22.898 --> 54:26.736
I'm sure it was just a prank,
that's why I didn't call anybody.

54:27.702 --> 54:29.942
- And where did the carcass end up?
- I took it out to the desert...

54:30.022 --> 54:33.662
...and got rid of it. I really didn't
wanna make a big deal out of it.

54:33.742 --> 54:37.099
Well, you made one, Ray.
Because the rangers found it this morning.

54:37.179 --> 54:39.015
Or what was left of it.

54:40.582 --> 54:44.006
Look, if you're gonna roast a pig...

54:44.086 --> 54:46.522
...do it in a fucking campsite, will ya?

54:47.055 --> 54:50.046
I'm sorry, Howard,
I really didn't know what to do.

54:50.126 --> 54:51.830
You know, Maggie was pretty upset about it...

54:51.910 --> 54:55.324
...and I just wanted to get the thing
out of here. It was pretty weird.

54:55.404 --> 55:00.856
So that happens, and what, you're on
your way back here, and you get lost?

55:00.936 --> 55:03.892
Because the boys say you don't show
back up here for a couple hours.

55:03.972 --> 55:07.029
Yeah, I just sat in my truck and...

55:07.609 --> 55:11.433
...listened to music. I just needed
to decompress from everything.

55:12.113 --> 55:16.118
That's what I saw on the general store
cameras, I appreciate you leveling with me.

55:16.651 --> 55:19.275
- Do you know who did it?
- Well, who's to say?

55:19.355 --> 55:21.977
Some punks with nothing
better to do, I'm sure.

55:22.057 --> 55:26.035
They used to give Ben grief all the time,
I will talk to them, to back off.

55:26.115 --> 55:30.534
I mean, does this have anything to do
with that girl who killed herself?

55:36.171 --> 55:38.795
I can't quite understand how anybody...

55:38.875 --> 55:40.629
...could come up with that.

55:41.309 --> 55:44.399
Unless she knew how to slit
her belly clean through...

55:44.879 --> 55:48.191
...before she jumped into the water.

55:49.984 --> 55:51.854
Killed herself?

56:00.261 --> 56:02.098
She was just a townie.

56:04.132 --> 56:06.055
- Crissy Neal.
- Crissy?

56:06.135 --> 56:09.373
Parents died right out of high school,
she was just a drifter.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.328
No one to care about her.

56:12.408 --> 56:15.857
I mean, she had some folks that she was friends
with here in town, and I liked her a lot...

56:15.937 --> 56:17.746
...sweet pea.

56:18.546 --> 56:22.385
Then the L.A. prick shows up,
does what he does to her...

56:23.084 --> 56:25.888
...and he stayed here for a little while.

56:27.289 --> 56:31.045
They're looking for him,
but, you know, L.A.'s a big town.

56:31.225 --> 56:33.081
How long ago...

56:33.161 --> 56:34.599
...did it happen?

56:35.229 --> 56:37.253
It's funny you should ask me that.

56:38.333 --> 56:41.890
Because the answer is a real pisser.

56:42.370 --> 56:46.191
It was the night after you showed up here
to come see this place for the first time.

56:46.541 --> 56:49.798
I mean, it was just a couple months ago
you came here to look at it, right?

56:49.878 --> 56:53.768
And the boys across the street said they
saw your same truck in this parking lot...

56:54.348 --> 56:56.185
...the day before.

56:56.486 --> 56:59.289
Is that some strange-ass timing or what?

57:00.322 --> 57:02.076
Did you do it?

57:02.156 --> 57:05.195
- Did I do it?
- Did you do it?

57:06.796 --> 57:08.984
- Did I do what?
- Ray, did you do it?

57:09.064 --> 57:11.935
- Did I do what, the pig?
- Did you do it?

57:13.629 --> 57:15.024
- Howard?
- Ray, did you do it?

57:15.104 --> 57:17.192
- Did I do...
- Did you do it?

57:17.272 --> 57:18.671
- Did I do what?
- Ray, did you do it?

57:18.751 --> 57:20.809
- Did I do what?
- Did you do it?

57:20.889 --> 57:22.945
Did I do what?

57:23.811 --> 57:26.415
I know you didn't do it. It's all right.

57:29.084 --> 57:31.087
So you in touch with Ben at all?

57:32.221 --> 57:33.857
No.

57:34.057 --> 57:36.912
Listen, Ray, I want you
to give me a shout if you see...

57:36.992 --> 57:39.815
...just anyone unusual around here.

57:39.895 --> 57:41.430
Unusual?

57:43.732 --> 57:46.956
So far, just you, Howard.

57:47.136 --> 57:48.257
Come again?

57:48.337 --> 57:52.208
I've never seen anybody who'd ask
for coffee in this kind of heat.

57:54.542 --> 57:57.780
Well, you know, you keep
making it this good...

57:59.248 --> 58:01.251
...I might come an awful lot.

58:02.584 --> 58:04.420
Take care of yourself, Ray.

58:44.326 --> 58:46.513
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:46.895 --> 58:49.733
- Just one person?
- Mm-hmm.

58:54.870 --> 58:56.739
I'll give you...

58:57.272 --> 58:58.927
...room three.

58:59.007 --> 59:00.561
Oh.

59:00.941 --> 59:02.964
I really like that end room.

59:03.044 --> 59:05.047
What number is that again?

59:05.514 --> 59:08.538
- Ten.
- That's right...

59:08.618 --> 59:12.154
...ten's a peach. I'll take 10.

59:47.723 --> 59:50.127
There you go. Have a good night.

59:51.493 --> 59:53.346
You too.

59:53.594 --> 59:56.866
Oh, and if you need anything...

59:58.000 --> 59:59.536
...say...

01:00:00.235 --> 01:00:02.039
...coffee, or...

01:00:03.739 --> 01:00:05.626
...just anything...

01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:08.544
...I'll have a fresh pot here in the morning.

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:14.083
I know what you need.

01:00:16.717 --> 01:00:18.306
- Brochures.
- What?

01:00:18.386 --> 01:00:21.207
One of those racks with all the brochures.

01:00:21.723 --> 01:00:23.525
Goes right over there.

01:00:23.605 --> 01:00:25.494
Or over there.

01:00:26.627 --> 01:00:28.431
Good night.

01:01:13.874 --> 01:01:15.389
What?

01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:17.470
What? What is it?

01:01:18.037 --> 01:01:23.577
Snake. A black snake. I'm so scared.

01:01:23.657 --> 01:01:26.554
I'm so scared of snakes.

01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:44.559
It's a tiny little snake.

01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:49.797
- I no clean. No clean this room.
- Okay, I'll clean. I'll clean. I'll clean it.

01:01:49.877 --> 01:01:51.899
- I no clean.
- I'll clean.

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:53.782
I no clean.

01:02:02.623 --> 01:02:04.745
<i>Plane left alone...</i>

01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:06.916
Oh, my God, Ray, come here.

01:02:07.296 --> 01:02:09.417
<i>Found a body and called the police.</i>

01:02:09.497 --> 01:02:12.120
- <i>The woman has now been identified...</i>
- What? What is it, Maggie?

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.203
<i>...Jessica Phillips.</i>

01:02:15.571 --> 01:02:18.088
<i>The cause of death is still unknown,
but police are working...</i>

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:21.696
<i>...with the medical examiner's office
to determine exactly how she died...</i>

01:02:21.776 --> 01:02:25.156
<i>...but so far results of an autopsy
have not yet been released.</i>

01:02:25.236 --> 01:02:27.065
Is that her, Ray?

01:02:27.145 --> 01:02:29.301
That's her, isn't it?

01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:31.554
She was our first guest.

01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:30.413
Ray, can you get that?

01:03:34.116 --> 01:03:35.619
Ray?

01:03:38.386 --> 01:03:40.423
Okay, I'll get it.

01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:45.780
Hi, can I help you?

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.030
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:49.934
About Ray.

01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:05.215
Ray, pick up.

01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:15.524
Fuck!

01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:27.404
Hi, how are you?

01:04:27.969 --> 01:04:30.057
Would you mind filling
this out for me, please?

01:04:30.137 --> 01:04:31.693
Okay.

01:04:31.873 --> 01:04:35.581
Do you have a room preference?
We've got double or king available.

01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:38.567
That I do. Room 10, please.

01:04:39.247 --> 01:04:41.050
Been here before?

01:04:50.658 --> 01:04:51.980
This your old man?

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.497
Yeah, Ray, why? You know him?

01:04:57.866 --> 01:04:59.455
Hmm.

01:04:59.535 --> 01:05:02.138
I'd keep my eye on that one if I were you.

01:06:32.628 --> 01:06:35.824
- Are you ready to do everything I say?
- Yes, mistress.

01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:38.493
I'm sorry, did I say that you could speak?

01:06:38.573 --> 01:06:40.403
Get on your knees.

01:06:45.874 --> 01:06:48.310
Are you ready to do everything I say?

01:06:52.714 --> 01:06:54.584
Good, knees.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.400
Do my shoes look clean to you?

01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:16.339
- No, mistress.
- I'm sorry, did I say you could speak?

01:07:18.774 --> 01:07:20.644
Why don't you clean them?

01:07:31.586 --> 01:07:33.168
Good.

01:07:57.478 --> 01:07:59.047
Good.

01:08:03.217 --> 01:08:05.021
You have permission.

01:09:29.438 --> 01:09:31.841
God damn you fucks!

01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:38.082
Hey, did you see that, just now?

01:09:38.162 --> 01:09:41.590
Someone just threw red paint,
maybe blood, over my wall down there.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.506
- Did you see anybody?
- I wasn't watching.

01:09:43.587 --> 01:09:44.620
- You weren't?
- No.

01:09:44.786 --> 01:09:47.642
You spent a lot of time watching my place.
Figured you must've seen somebody.

01:09:47.721 --> 01:09:49.765
- Now why would I watch your place?
- You tell me.

01:09:49.845 --> 01:09:53.881
- You want something or not?
- Yeah, I want you out of my fucking business.

01:09:53.962 --> 01:09:56.841
And I might just call the cops anyway,
tell them I suspect you.

01:09:56.921 --> 01:09:58.620
Look, I got no time for your shit.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.170
It might've been locals,
but don't come in here accusing me.

01:10:10.078 --> 01:10:11.982
So, that's your place now, huh?

01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:16.070
That's right.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:18.740
Sure as hell wouldn't want your gig.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.523
Why's that?

01:10:20.856 --> 01:10:25.213
Seems like the pool would be
hard to keep clean is all.

01:10:25.293 --> 01:10:27.381
Do you know that woman from the news tonight?

01:10:27.461 --> 01:10:30.298
Everybody knows everybody around here.

01:10:31.765 --> 01:10:33.568
Except you.

01:12:00.922 --> 01:12:02.410
Hi.

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.460
Do you remember me?

01:12:05.526 --> 01:12:08.248
- Should I?
- I run the Motorway Motel...

01:12:08.328 --> 01:12:11.734
- ...over off to 55.
- Congratulations.

01:12:13.366 --> 01:12:16.057
Listen, baby, you're cute,
but check back with me tomorrow, okay?

01:12:16.137 --> 01:12:18.081
I have a date on the way.

01:12:18.161 --> 01:12:20.176
No, I'm not here about that.

01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:25.733
- Well, please, just sit right down.
- I saw you at my place.

01:12:25.813 --> 01:12:27.065
You were with...

01:12:27.145 --> 01:12:31.170
...you were with that girl from room six,
the one they found out in the desert.

01:12:34.155 --> 01:12:36.159
You like to watch, is that it?

01:12:38.558 --> 01:12:40.296
You got that look.

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:47.255
You know the more you watch,
the less you feel.

01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:49.138
Come here.

01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:52.408
I wanna see if I know you.

01:12:54.308 --> 01:12:58.147
Easy, baby, don't hurt yourself.

01:12:59.246 --> 01:13:01.050
Mama won't let you fall.

01:13:02.649 --> 01:13:04.519
Nobody's watching.

01:13:06.486 --> 01:13:09.558
Hey, we're just sitting here
looking at each other, right?

01:13:11.889 --> 01:13:15.218
You were with that girl the night she died.

01:13:16.297 --> 01:13:18.301
She needed a friend, is all.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.070
I was her friend.

01:13:24.038 --> 01:13:28.128
- What are you, a cop?
- No, I just... run the motel.

01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:31.065
Well, why don't you go do that then?
I'm meeting someone.

01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:32.948
I'll move when they get here.

01:13:33.749 --> 01:13:35.285
Yes, you will.

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:39.239
I don't know anything about that girl
or any other girl.

01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:41.675
Yeah, you do.
You just said you were her friend.

01:13:41.755 --> 01:13:45.760
- So what else do you know?
- I know get the fuck away from me.

01:13:46.259 --> 01:13:48.323
You got a problem here, Cassie?

01:13:48.403 --> 01:13:49.917
Yeah.

01:13:50.297 --> 01:13:52.166
But it's just leaving.

01:13:52.246 --> 01:13:54.805
- Time to go.
- I'm talking to her.

01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:58.025
Get the fuck out! Now, motherfucker, go.

01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:00.595
Alright! Alright.

01:14:00.675 --> 01:14:02.745
Who else was in that room with you?

01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:05.981
Wanna be a hero?

01:14:07.648 --> 01:14:09.307
Back up.

01:14:09.387 --> 01:14:12.788
- Back the fuck up. Back up!
- Okay. Alright. Okay.

01:14:13.387 --> 01:14:15.590
- Easy.
- Yeah?

01:14:16.291 --> 01:14:18.526
You don't wanna do anything stupid.

01:14:28.203 --> 01:14:30.473
Stay the fuck away from my motel.

01:14:31.405 --> 01:14:33.241
The Motorway Motel.

01:14:34.075 --> 01:14:36.179
You're not... you're not welcome.

01:15:49.684 --> 01:15:51.662
Honey, I'm so sorry, I left my phone.

01:15:51.742 --> 01:15:54.324
- Where were you this time, Ray?
- What?

01:15:54.423 --> 01:15:56.943
And don't tell me
that you went out for a beer.

01:15:57.023 --> 01:15:59.547
I saw you go after that bitch, I saw you.

01:15:59.627 --> 01:16:02.088
- It was not like that.
- Did you fuck her?

01:16:02.168 --> 01:16:05.920
- What? What are you talking about?
- And the girl that was staying here...

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.547
...the one that got murdered,
I bet you fucked her too.

01:16:08.627 --> 01:16:12.108
What the fuck are you talking about, Maggie?

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.529
Howard came...

01:16:14.609 --> 01:16:17.232
...Ray, and he was asking
all kinds of questions...

01:16:17.312 --> 01:16:20.801
- ...about the night that she stayed here.
- You waited this long to tell me?

01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:24.152
I was trying to call you!

01:16:26.888 --> 01:16:28.723
What'd you say to him?

01:16:33.328 --> 01:16:37.974
I told him that you were here and that we
were together and that we got in a fight...

01:16:38.054 --> 01:16:40.955
...and that you went to go blow off
some steam, that you weren't here.

01:16:41.035 --> 01:16:42.389
- Okay.
- Is that good enough for you?

01:16:42.469 --> 01:16:44.709
- Yeah, that's okay.
- Don't you fucking touch me.

01:16:44.789 --> 01:16:46.643
Don't touch me!

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:48.995
Ow!

01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:52.232
Maggie, stop, open the door!

01:16:52.312 --> 01:16:55.392
- Goddammit! Just calm down.
- Stay away from me, Ray.

01:16:55.472 --> 01:16:59.739
- Would you just open the goddamn door?
- Stay the fuck away from me!

01:17:01.755 --> 01:17:03.778
No, no, I'm not letting you.

01:17:03.858 --> 01:17:06.532
No, you are not. No.

01:17:09.396 --> 01:17:13.320
- You fucked the whore.
- Calm down. Calm down!

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.297
Calm down. You're gonna cool off.

01:17:15.377 --> 01:17:17.124
- No, let me go!
- Calm down!

01:17:17.204 --> 01:17:19.327
Fuck you, Ray, I won't calm down!

01:17:19.407 --> 01:17:22.697
- Cool off, Maggie.
- Fucking let go.

01:17:22.777 --> 01:17:26.381
Calm down, that's it, that's it.

01:17:27.214 --> 01:17:28.490
Ow!

01:17:33.721 --> 01:17:35.242
Maggie.

01:17:35.322 --> 01:17:39.212
Come on... just... please,
I don't wanna have a fight.

01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:40.981
Okay, okay.

01:17:41.061 --> 01:17:42.484
Dammit, Ray.

01:17:42.564 --> 01:17:45.560
I just... just let it out, that's okay.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.575
Okay, alright.

01:17:47.835 --> 01:17:49.404
Alright.

01:18:15.095 --> 01:18:16.698
Maggie?

01:18:17.799 --> 01:18:19.754
Hey, Ray.

01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:21.488
Remember my mom's cabin?

01:18:21.568 --> 01:18:25.000
We went there one spring
when I was still talking to her.

01:18:25.472 --> 01:18:29.195
I think I'm gonna go there for a while
and sort some stuff out.

01:18:29.275 --> 01:18:31.565
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:18:31.645 --> 01:18:33.734
Last night was...

01:18:33.814 --> 01:18:36.470
...it was great in its own way but...

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:40.875
...I think it's best if you hold down
the fort here for a little while. Yeah?

01:18:40.955 --> 01:18:42.776
That way you don't have to...

01:18:42.856 --> 01:18:46.662
...feel badly about lying all the time
when you fuck around.

01:18:47.127 --> 01:18:51.420
It's okay. It's who you are,
it's who you're always gonna be, but...

01:18:52.066 --> 01:18:55.355
...I realized something
about myself last night.

01:18:55.803 --> 01:19:01.097
I can't live like this anymore, because
no matter how badly it might hurt...

01:19:01.676 --> 01:19:03.730
...I don't wanna be lied to anymore.

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:06.248
Maggie, I need you here with me.

01:19:09.075 --> 01:19:11.238
If there's stuff I didn't tell you...

01:19:11.318 --> 01:19:13.922
...it was because I was so worried about you.

01:19:14.988 --> 01:19:18.480
- It's true, Maggie, please.
- What?

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.338
You got... you gotta stay.

01:19:24.765 --> 01:19:27.969
- What is it?
- Oh, Maggie.

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:31.707
Talk to me.

01:19:34.609 --> 01:19:37.880
I... I'll just show it to you, I'll show you.

01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:45.988
You watched people have sex
without them knowing it.

01:19:49.357 --> 01:19:52.161
That woman, you followed her to the bar?

01:19:58.399 --> 01:20:00.568
Who the fuck are you, Ray?

01:20:02.802 --> 01:20:05.040
You sat behind this mirror.

01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:09.043
Jesus Christ, look at you, look at your face.

01:20:10.778 --> 01:20:14.602
This is a crime, Ray,
we could lose the motel...

01:20:14.682 --> 01:20:16.519
...you could go to jail.

01:20:17.651 --> 01:20:19.507
I feel sick.

01:20:19.587 --> 01:20:22.611
It was stupid, I know.

01:20:23.191 --> 01:20:25.012
It's my fault.

01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:28.395
- Something happened in this room.
- Like what?

01:20:28.475 --> 01:20:30.331
I don't know for sure.

01:20:31.766 --> 01:20:34.321
Might have something to do
with that girl's death.

01:20:34.401 --> 01:20:36.424
And maybe the other girl, Crissy.

01:20:37.104 --> 01:20:39.174
I don't think they're the only ones.

01:21:12.839 --> 01:21:14.146
Morning.

01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:17.325
I didn't expect you on a Sunday.

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:19.467
Yeah, it surprised the both of us.

01:21:19.947 --> 01:21:21.469
Oh...

01:21:21.749 --> 01:21:24.536
- ...what happened there?
- This, it's nothing...

01:21:24.616 --> 01:21:28.308
...I just banged it on a corner
last night, being careless.

01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:30.791
Come a little closer,
let me take a look at that.

01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:35.548
Oh, yeah, buddy, you got your shiner.
Let me get you an ice pack.

01:21:35.628 --> 01:21:39.553
No, no, I'm fine, really.
Why don't I get you some coffee?

01:21:39.633 --> 01:21:43.890
I'm good. Iced tea. You were right,
why drink coffee in this heat?

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:47.975
You just keep doing whatever you were
doing, I'll just hang out with you a bit.

01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:52.198
I was just finishing up cleaning some rooms.

01:21:52.278 --> 01:21:54.111
Good by me.

01:21:57.283 --> 01:21:59.888
Yeah, after what you said,
I got to thinking...

01:22:00.788 --> 01:22:05.576
...how dumb it was to be drinking
something hot when I'm already hot.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.050
Guess there's something to be said
for that big city logic.

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:13.553
- Why do you think I'm from the city?
- You told me.

01:22:14.033 --> 01:22:16.557
I did? I don't remember that.

01:22:16.637 --> 01:22:19.742
No? Somebody told me.

01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:23.938
Now maybe it was Ben before you...

01:22:24.018 --> 01:22:26.281
...before you got here, I don't know.

01:22:30.317 --> 01:22:32.121
The hell was that?

01:22:33.586 --> 01:22:36.057
Goddamn praying mantis in here.

01:22:38.059 --> 01:22:40.713
You ever see the inside wings
of one these things?

01:22:40.793 --> 01:22:44.265
It's like a dark, burnt orange,
kind of like a sunset.

01:22:45.533 --> 01:22:47.569
When they fly at you, it's...

01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:51.038
...like there's a demon
heading right for you.

01:22:55.675 --> 01:22:57.649
Ah, here's something.

01:23:01.748 --> 01:23:04.018
Jesus, that could've gone better.

01:23:06.686 --> 01:23:09.016
- Sorry, Ray.
- It's okay.

01:23:09.096 --> 01:23:11.606
Here, just give me a wet cloth,
I'll clean this up.

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:14.930
No, really, it's fine, I'll take care of it.

01:23:17.597 --> 01:23:20.088
Listen, I'm in your way. You know, you...

01:23:20.168 --> 01:23:23.490
...you just answer me one thing,
and I'll get out of your hair.

01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:25.139
Okay.

01:23:25.638 --> 01:23:28.996
I really... need to speak with Ben.

01:23:29.076 --> 01:23:32.100
Have you ever heard anything from him?

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.914
No.

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:38.106
You don't think Ben has anything
to do with this, do you?

01:23:38.186 --> 01:23:40.574
Well, only that he might
remember something...

01:23:40.654 --> 01:23:43.745
...from the first time round,
help me make a case.

01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:46.461
It's a poke in the grass,
but it's worth a shot.

01:23:47.361 --> 01:23:49.683
So, do you know?

01:23:49.763 --> 01:23:53.000
I... I don't, Howard, I'm sorry.

01:23:55.067 --> 01:23:58.259
You know, we're small-town
cops and all, but...

01:23:58.339 --> 01:24:00.175
...it doesn't mean that...

01:24:01.174 --> 01:24:04.366
...we don't have access
to the big city police reports.

01:24:13.803 --> 01:24:15.623
You had some year, huh?

01:24:16.455 --> 01:24:19.112
I mean, it's bad enough
that your little girl...

01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:20.898
...falls...

01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:24.566
...from a window,
but then all these questions pop up.

01:24:26.067 --> 01:24:28.672
Were there domestic dispute calls
made to the residence?

01:24:28.752 --> 01:24:32.559
Was the wife a known substance abuser?
Or the husband a heavy drinker?

01:24:32.639 --> 01:24:36.400
And why was the husband socializing...

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.481
...with the neighbor next door
during the incident?

01:24:41.748 --> 01:24:45.421
Can the parents be charged with
child negligence? I mean, is this...

01:24:48.121 --> 01:24:52.145
...is this why you made
some kind of deal with Ben?

01:24:52.625 --> 01:24:54.462
I don't...

01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:57.875
...feel like talking to you anymore.

01:24:57.955 --> 01:25:00.835
Look, I get it, you wanna put all this
behind you. You move somewhere new...

01:25:00.915 --> 01:25:04.323
...you wanna start fresh,
but Ben Harling has left you...

01:25:04.403 --> 01:25:07.061
...holding a steaming bag of shit.

01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:09.770
And I don't know why you're so loyal to him.

01:25:11.745 --> 01:25:14.016
I need all the help I can get, Ray.

01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:20.551
- How many times you think she's been here?
- Maybe five, six times total.

01:25:23.023 --> 01:25:26.780
She was registered under Sally Smith,
but I think they also call her Cassie.

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.184
- Who does?
- Some guy did in a bar last night.

01:25:30.264 --> 01:25:32.753
You were with her in a bar last night?

01:25:32.833 --> 01:25:36.056
I just happened to be drinking
at the same place.

01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:38.637
Yeah, with a gun, I heard.

01:25:41.242 --> 01:25:45.529
I know who that is, she goes
by a ton of names. It just...

01:25:45.609 --> 01:25:48.702
...up to her old tricks again. But, hey,
listen, do you remember who it was?

01:25:48.782 --> 01:25:50.537
- Who what was?
- Called her Cassie.

01:25:50.617 --> 01:25:54.241
Just some guy did, I didn't know him.
He was big, had a crew cut.

01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:56.992
- What, like a military crew cut?
- Yeah.

01:25:58.492 --> 01:26:00.728
Who knows, maybe she has a...

01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:04.485
- ...partner in this crew cut guy.
- What do you mean, partner?

01:26:04.565 --> 01:26:06.434
I don't know.

01:26:07.434 --> 01:26:09.290
Maybe they're into some...

01:26:09.370 --> 01:26:12.225
...weirdness together.
You know, fetish stuff...

01:26:12.305 --> 01:26:15.992
...sick shit, theatrics, whatever.
I'm not sure exactly, but...

01:26:16.542 --> 01:26:20.333
- ...there's something going on with her.
- I'm afraid I'm not following.

01:26:20.413 --> 01:26:23.503
You said you wanted me to tell you
about anybody unusual?

01:26:23.583 --> 01:26:25.419
She's unusual.

01:26:27.822 --> 01:26:32.079
- Sorry, I got a customer.
- Yeah, no, you did the right thing here.

01:26:32.159 --> 01:26:36.030
This... this could be a lead
in all of this, and if you...

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.586
...end up seeing that Mustang again
I want you to call the station...

01:26:39.666 --> 01:26:42.611
...and you ask just for me. I'll get
a GPS on that and I'll see where it goes.

01:26:42.691 --> 01:26:46.363
- Right.
- And, Ray... listen...

01:26:46.773 --> 01:26:48.995
...are you in touch with Ben?

01:26:49.075 --> 01:26:51.422
No, I am not.

01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:54.515
Alright.

01:26:55.949 --> 01:26:59.421
Ray. Ray, look... hey, thanks for that.

01:27:04.926 --> 01:27:09.950
Uh, yeah, hi. Can I get the number
for a Ben Harling, please?

01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:11.819
Benjamin, maybe.

01:27:11.899 --> 01:27:14.855
H-A-R-L-I-N-G.

01:27:14.935 --> 01:27:19.060
I realize that, but I very much
need to speak with him, so...

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:23.030
...so please if you hear from him,
would you tell him to call me.

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.180
Tell him it's an emergency.

01:27:36.355 --> 01:27:37.777
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Ray?</i>

01:27:37.857 --> 01:27:39.836
- Yes, yeah, Ben.
- <i>You called?</i>

01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:43.998
Ben, I know, I know, I've been trying
to track you down. I need to talk to you.

01:27:45.199 --> 01:27:49.490
- Are you still there?
- <i>Just meet me at the High Pass Road.</i>

01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:53.963
<i>Just past the wind turbine,
by the old Country Two exit.</i>

01:27:54.043 --> 01:27:56.311
Ben, Ben?

01:29:43.918 --> 01:29:46.388
- Ray?
- Ben.

01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:49.643
Are you alone?

01:29:50.023 --> 01:29:51.526
Yeah.

01:29:55.795 --> 01:29:58.217
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:29:58.297 --> 01:30:00.735
Okay, okay.

01:30:02.602 --> 01:30:04.430
- Good.
- What was that?

01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:07.093
It's Russian-made,
they use it in the Ukraine.

01:30:07.173 --> 01:30:09.528
Are you staying up there somewhere?

01:30:09.608 --> 01:30:13.266
Oh, somewhere, man, but not staying long.

01:30:13.346 --> 01:30:15.034
You can bet on that.

01:30:15.114 --> 01:30:17.970
I don't think anybody followed me,
if that's what you think.

01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:20.573
Well, it's conceivable, isn't it?

01:30:20.653 --> 01:30:23.057
Everything is conceivable.

01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:28.181
Oh, Ray, did you finish
that screen door for room three?

01:30:28.261 --> 01:30:31.585
I had three guys working on it,
it was like major brain surgery...

01:30:31.665 --> 01:30:36.329
- ...and I would've done it myself...
- The door's fine. We need to talk.

01:30:36.409 --> 01:30:40.025
About what? I... I really
shouldn't even be here, Ray.

01:30:40.105 --> 01:30:42.995
I came down because
you were calling everybody...

01:30:43.075 --> 01:30:45.964
- ...and you can't do that.
- Come on, Ben. Ben.

01:30:46.044 --> 01:30:48.801
- What is going on?
- What is going on?

01:30:48.881 --> 01:30:53.040
The world is demented,
it is peerlessly demented.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.909
It's all this shit that's coming down,
and you know.

01:30:56.989 --> 01:31:00.661
You built that thing, didn't you?
That tunnel.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:05.486
What did you see? Did you see something, Ray?

01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:09.602
I... I never did anything, I...
I never even said anything.

01:31:09.682 --> 01:31:13.626
You put them in room 10, right,
and then you watched?

01:31:13.706 --> 01:31:18.298
It was sociology, it's the study of people.

01:31:18.378 --> 01:31:21.909
- I like to study people, that's all.
- Right.

01:31:21.989 --> 01:31:25.906
Did you see something, Ray.
You should close it up.

01:31:25.986 --> 01:31:28.515
And you should...
you should think about getting out.

01:31:28.595 --> 01:31:30.659
Was somebody killed in there?

01:31:31.657 --> 01:31:33.160
Crissy?

01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:35.849
Little Crissy.

01:31:35.929 --> 01:31:38.967
Oh, wow, she was a...

01:31:39.899 --> 01:31:43.572
...she was quite a child.
She was special, that one.

01:31:46.039 --> 01:31:48.095
Listen, Ray.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:50.998
I tell you what, I'll send you
back half your money, okay?

01:31:51.078 --> 01:31:53.332
Half the money, you can take it or leave it.

01:31:53.412 --> 01:31:57.070
But take that lovely wife of yours and go.

01:31:57.150 --> 01:32:00.005
And maybe you'll be fine.

01:32:00.085 --> 01:32:02.179
She brought in that new microwave, right?

01:32:02.889 --> 01:32:05.029
You got a new micro...

01:32:25.879 --> 01:32:28.334
Come on, come on, pick up.

01:32:28.414 --> 01:32:32.405
Maggie, Maggie, please, you really
have to listen to me very carefully.

01:32:32.485 --> 01:32:36.676
We have to leave now. We have to leave
now, just lock yourself in the house...

01:32:36.756 --> 01:32:38.813
...and don't answer the door for anybody.

01:32:38.893 --> 01:32:42.829
Please, look, there's no time to explain,
just... just do what I say...

01:32:42.909 --> 01:32:45.919
...I'll tell you everything
when we're on the road.

01:32:45.999 --> 01:32:48.986
Just pack. Ben's dead, pack now!

01:33:08.621 --> 01:33:10.193
Maggie.

01:33:10.563 --> 01:33:12.134
Maggie?

01:35:20.719 --> 01:35:22.956
Looks like your boy is gonna chicken out.

01:35:24.524 --> 01:35:27.329
I really wanted you to see me
blow his head off.

01:35:28.362 --> 01:35:32.901
Yeah, he's just yellow, you know,
you can kinda... just kinda tell.

01:35:34.534 --> 01:35:37.448
Probably just packing up his shit
to go right now. But listen, when...

01:35:37.528 --> 01:35:40.575
...we hear that truck pull away, we can...

01:35:41.974 --> 01:35:43.998
...commence our getting it on.

01:35:45.578 --> 01:35:48.867
What's that, I can't hear you? Hang on.

01:35:50.482 --> 01:35:52.739
Hang on, hang on.

01:35:52.819 --> 01:35:54.940
Fucking freak, let me go!

01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.023
- Let me...
- Hey, shh.

01:35:59.543 --> 01:36:01.244
Please.

01:36:01.394 --> 01:36:03.482
- Please.
- Get away? No.

01:36:03.562 --> 01:36:06.920
- Please.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.165
No. I wanna get so close to you that...

01:36:11.245 --> 01:36:14.508
...I'll be in front of you
and behind you at the same time.

01:36:17.277 --> 01:36:19.533
And everywhere in between.

01:36:20.113 --> 01:36:24.011
And I really wanted this to look
like a murder suicide, but...

01:36:24.091 --> 01:36:27.227
...if Ray's not gonna take the bait...

01:36:30.389 --> 01:36:33.619
...then it's just gonna have to look
like he killed his cheating wife.

01:36:34.459 --> 01:36:37.315
And I'll deal with him
on the road when I catch him.

01:36:55.916 --> 01:36:58.140
What the fuck?

01:37:23.176 --> 01:37:27.013
Son of a bitch,
that's how Ben knew what I'd done.

01:37:27.412 --> 01:37:30.671
Fucking pervert. You a pervert, Ray?

01:37:31.251 --> 01:37:33.700
You see this? Your boy's been whacking off...

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.961
...while watching the hotel guests
bang each other.

01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:00.914
Ray!

01:38:20.386 --> 01:38:22.437
Shit, that could've gone better.

01:38:23.703 --> 01:38:25.726
Jesus fuck, Ray.

01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:19.112
Hey, buddy...

01:39:19.192 --> 01:39:22.263
...ma'am. Uh, 10 available?
