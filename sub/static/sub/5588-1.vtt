00:02.469 --> 00:03.966
Haley, your dad's on the phone.

00:03.971 --> 00:05.439
He says it's urgent.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.269
He's with a surgeon?
I think he said "sturgeon".

00:07.274 --> 00:09.343
Cam, is it "surgeon" or "sturgeon"?

00:09.384 --> 00:12.008
I am ripping these stupid braces
off the second I get home.

00:12.013 --> 00:15.011
Phil, hold on. I'm gonna put
you on speakerphone, okay?

00:15.016 --> 00:16.612
Andy's on his way to propose to Beth!

00:16.617 --> 00:17.947
We can't hear anything!

00:17.952 --> 00:19.448
Just toss me the phone.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.022
No! No, no. No, you're right.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.651
We all have our strengths.
I'm a great gift giver.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.216
Here, cam. Oh.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.785
Dad?

00:25.793 --> 00:27.728
Haley, Andy's on his way
to propose to Beth!

00:27.769 --> 00:28.824
Aww!

00:28.829 --> 00:30.826
That's very sweet! It's not sweet!

00:30.831 --> 00:33.167
Haley and Andy love each other,
but they don't know it!

00:33.208 --> 00:34.827
Whoa. Is that true, honey?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.632
Dad, what makes you think
he's in love with me?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.467
I could tell by the way
he hugged you goodbye.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.307
Phil, are you sure about this?

00:40.348 --> 00:43.172
Claire, I think I know the look
of love in another man's eyes.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.674
This is crazy. Should I call him?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.848
His phone's off, but he said
he was going to the beach.

00:47.889 --> 00:50.017
I know what beach he likes.

00:50.058 --> 00:52.747
I thought you were the "beach" he likes.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.859
Oh, God, there they are.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.828
Should I do this? I shouldn't do this.

01:00.869 --> 01:02.088
I'm gonna do this.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.225
W-- honey, honey,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03.230 --> 01:07.029
You got to be really sure of this.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.571
You're gonna go over there
and break them up for what?

01:10.612 --> 01:14.737
To hang out or to date
until the next guy comes along?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.077
Who knows?

01:16.118 --> 01:18.737
But shouldn't we get a chance
to find out what we are?

01:18.746 --> 01:21.744
I'm just saying
look down the road a little.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.914
You're 21, and that looks like a guy

01:24.919 --> 01:26.849
who is ready to settle down.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:35.029 --> 01:37.026
Yeah. Well, um...

01:37.031 --> 01:39.967
I guess it's decided for me. Yeah.

01:40.008 --> 01:42.027
I feel like such an idiot.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.196
No. Honey, no, no, no, no, no.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.365
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.870
Oh, God! Here they come! Hide!

01:47.875 --> 01:50.735
Just -- oh...

Original Air Date on September 23, 2015

02:06.760 --> 02:09.289
Oh, God. Oh.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.455
Daddy looks tense.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.961
He's just paying bills.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.296
Is everything okay, honey?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.431
Oh, you walked over here.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.096
I just thought you uber-ed everywhere.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.901
Okay. Okay, I got to breathe.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.436
That's still free, isn't it?

02:20.441 --> 02:21.737
Mitchell, it's not that bad.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.577
Really? Because I haven't
worked in weeks.

02:23.618 --> 02:25.074
I have no prospects.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.747
We're living off
of a gym teacher's salary,

02:26.788 --> 02:28.844
and -- and somehow I let you

02:28.849 --> 02:30.518
talk me into buying
the apartment upstairs.

02:30.559 --> 02:32.678
What's going on? Are we poor?

02:32.686 --> 02:35.016
No, while other daddy looks for a job,

02:35.022 --> 02:36.190
I'm gonna be taking on some work

02:36.231 --> 02:37.786
as a summertime driver's ed teacher.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.260
How much can that pay?

02:39.301 --> 02:40.356
Every little bit helps.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.857
And besides, Mitchell,
before you know it,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.430
you're gonna be back in a stuffy office

02:43.471 --> 02:44.999
with some stuffy lawyers,

02:45.040 --> 02:47.768
wishing you had taken advantage
of this time.

02:47.809 --> 02:48.797
Am I right?

02:48.802 --> 02:50.699
Well, that doesn't not sound like me.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.601
Exactly, so why don't
you take this chance...

02:52.606 --> 02:55.266
...To do something fun, find a hobby?

02:55.276 --> 02:58.106
You know, every time we go
to a gallery, you always say,

02:58.112 --> 02:59.608
"I could paint something that stupid."

02:59.613 --> 03:01.210
Well, prove it.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.645
You know what? I have.
I've always wanted to paint.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.981
And the place upstairs is
gonna be a rental gold mine --

03:05.986 --> 03:08.346
once we paint it, we furnish it,
we fix the electric,

03:08.355 --> 03:09.552
redo the plumbing,

03:09.557 --> 03:12.617
and figure out why that
brown spot won't stop growing.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.886
It's growing?

03:14.895 --> 03:18.155
Wow, did you two really just
waste your entire day quilting?

03:18.165 --> 03:20.995
We had a wonderful time,
didn't we, sweetie?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.831
I'm not crying anymore.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.666
To help get her mind off of Andy,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.168
Haley and I have been making a quilt

03:26.173 --> 03:28.509
out of all her old clothes...

03:28.550 --> 03:31.006
And some stuff I need Phil
to stop wearing.

03:31.011 --> 03:34.348
Oh, cool. That square is the
same pattern as my kangol hat.

03:34.389 --> 03:36.845
Can you believe how gorgeous
it is outside?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.650
And now it's gorgeous inside.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.016
Because you're inside. Was that clear?

03:41.021 --> 03:43.257
Hey, do you want to go quiz me
on the periodic table?

03:43.298 --> 03:44.517
Oxygen potassium.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.025
Ohh, he used the elements to say "okay".

03:48.429 --> 03:50.726
Oh, well, that was fun for me.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.828
Mom, can we drink now?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.768
Honey, it's lunchtime. Ohh.

03:54.809 --> 03:56.168
That's a "yes".

03:57.905 --> 04:00.502
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

04:00.507 --> 04:03.337
What? Sad Haley needs her mommy again.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.411
Oh, that's ridiculous.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.041
I'm just helping her
channel her broken heart

04:06.046 --> 04:07.406
into something more positive.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.079
Please, that's the saddest
blanket since the aids quilt.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.753
Haley's wallowing in self-pity,
and you're feeding off of it.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.250
You don't know what
you're talking about.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.185
Mom, I'm just gonna go take a nap.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.685
Oh, sweetheart, do you
want me to snuggle with you

04:17.690 --> 04:18.721
till you fall asleep?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.886
Okay, that's it. Pity party's over.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.731
Time for some Dunphy fun.
We are going to the movies.

04:23.772 --> 04:25.728
When was the last time you showered?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.029
What day is it?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.104
We will wait.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.067
I know you can't tell me,
but that b. Willis jungle gym --

04:32.072 --> 04:33.741
that's Bruce Willis, right?

04:33.782 --> 04:35.037
His kid goes here?

04:35.042 --> 04:38.040
Well, we do pride ourselves
on privacy here at Davenport,

04:38.045 --> 04:41.375
but, uh, you may have
a "sixth sense" about this.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.549
I'll be damned.

04:42.590 --> 04:43.617
He looks like the kind of guy

04:43.658 --> 04:45.077
you want to have a beer with, you know?

04:45.085 --> 04:47.645
We have one educator
for every four children --

04:47.655 --> 04:48.884
I have a question.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.886
Uh, I attend high school
with one of your graduates,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.559
a Theodore durkas.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.257
Did you turn him into a monster,
or was he always like that?

04:55.262 --> 04:57.131
I actually remember Teddy durkas.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.260
He was a lovely boy.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.395
I'll give him your regards

04:59.400 --> 05:01.330
next time he's making
one of my nurples purple.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.997
Ay, Joe, what did you do?!

05:05.005 --> 05:06.665
Oh, it's not his fault.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.771
These cubbies were donated
by a former parent

05:08.776 --> 05:10.336
who fancied himself a carpenter.

05:10.344 --> 05:13.013
I can't say who, but it is ironic

05:13.054 --> 05:15.911
that he couldn't use a hammer,
and now we "can't touch this".

05:15.916 --> 05:17.776
You keep saying you can't say,
and then you say.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.615
It's just nice to talk to adults.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.489
Hey, we're sold.
You want Joe? He's yours.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.254
It was very smart of you
to get a jump on next year.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.428
Next year? What -- what about this year?

05:27.469 --> 05:30.097
Oh, uh, we enroll at least a year out.

05:30.138 --> 05:32.327
And even then, there's
a significant waiting list.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.501
You're kidding.
I'm sorry, Mr. pritchett.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.998
Uh...

05:36.003 --> 05:38.339
You could try the learnin' barn.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.507
Ah, yes. That sounds very nice.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.337
The learnin' barn sounds nice?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.511
Yes, in my village,
only the richest kids

05:44.552 --> 05:47.276
were allowed to learn inside the barn.

05:47.281 --> 05:50.279
Hope you guys like dinosaurs.

05:50.284 --> 05:54.021
I got us tickets to "The Second
Best Exotic Marigold Hotel".

05:54.062 --> 05:55.189
I know you're kidding,

05:55.230 --> 05:58.519
but I found the first one
incredibly moving.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.055
I never realized how many people
hold hands in malls.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.891
And now that gays are legal or whatever,

06:02.896 --> 06:04.556
it's basically everyone.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.462
Oh, honey, I'll hold your hand.
Come here.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.297
Is that Dylan?

06:09.303 --> 06:11.300
No. No, that's --
that's definitely not Dylan.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.435
Dylan!

06:13.374 --> 06:15.209
Hello, Dunphy family!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.338
What the what?

06:16.343 --> 06:18.178
How you doing, buddy?

06:18.219 --> 06:20.808
Life's a roller coaster,
but I'm tall enough to ride.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.149
True dat.

06:22.190 --> 06:23.917
Haley, you look as yummy as ever.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.515
Thanks. What's going on?

06:26.520 --> 06:28.016
So, I'm designing t-shirts now,

06:28.021 --> 06:30.219
and I'm trying to get
the stores to sell them.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.220
I'm wearing one.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.385
"Lie"?
"Live".

06:32.393 --> 06:33.427
The neck is the "v".

06:33.468 --> 06:34.587
Game changer.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.892
Yeah, and I've got all
these great "v" words.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.557
"Love," "dove" --

06:38.565 --> 06:39.555
leave... "Governor".

06:39.566 --> 06:42.396
Wow, that is such a cool idea.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.737
It's so good to see you.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.597
Do you want to get some coffee sometime?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.436
I'm not doing anything right now.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.410
Uh, movie.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.910
Nice try, but not
all "v" words work, Mrs. D.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.206
Have fun, you two.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.346
"Hey, Dylan!"

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
_

07:04.391 --> 07:05.459
Mitchell, are you aware

07:05.500 --> 07:06.727
our daughter's eating
a ketchup sandwich?

07:06.768 --> 07:07.887
Good, she found something.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.755
So, you didn't go
grocery shopping today.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.432
I am gonna go, but after yoga.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.100
Hey -- hey, you should come with me,

07:13.141 --> 07:14.630
'cause you seem really tense.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.795
Oh, well, maybe they have
a five-minute class

07:16.804 --> 07:19.104
I could sneak in between
football camp and driver's ed?

07:20.274 --> 07:23.043
No, I'm very proud of you
and your grapefruit.

07:23.084 --> 07:25.541
Chrysler building.
Mitchell really embraced

07:25.546 --> 07:26.706
this whole "take a little break" thing

07:26.713 --> 07:27.781
far more than I expected.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.950
But for years, he supported both of us

07:29.991 --> 07:32.119
while I pursued my passions --

07:32.160 --> 07:34.949
photography, hip-hop dancing,
fox hunting.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.785
So I couldn't be the one
to tell him to get a job.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.162
But maybe somebody else could.

07:44.431 --> 07:47.267
Hey, Charlie? It's -- it's, uh, Cameron.

07:47.308 --> 07:49.097
My husband Mitchell
used to work for you.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.437
Oh!

07:50.478 --> 07:51.433
I remember you.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.407
Yeah, what a nice surprise.

07:53.448 --> 07:55.604
I know! Crazy!

07:55.609 --> 07:57.939
Crazy like that fox
I told Mitchell was chicken.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.510
Was it clear? I-I stalked Charlie.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.744
I can't believe it.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.118
Mitchell and I were just talking
about you last night.

08:05.159 --> 08:06.348
How are you?

08:06.353 --> 08:08.522
Well, I don't want to
burden you with my problems.

08:08.563 --> 08:11.119
Uh, I think I've outgrown my boat.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.259
Oh.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.927
Hey, how is Mitchell? He's fine.

08:13.968 --> 08:15.924
Actually, he's fielding
a few job offers right now,

08:15.929 --> 08:17.259
and he's running into problems

08:17.264 --> 08:19.700
because he keeps comparing
everyone to you.

08:19.741 --> 08:20.696
Huh.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.697
Sometimes I think the only thing

08:21.702 --> 08:23.370
that's gonna make him feel better

08:23.411 --> 08:26.507
is if you offered him another job.

08:26.548 --> 08:27.767
What the hell? I'll do it.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.877
Really? Yeah, I'm getting a new boat.

08:29.918 --> 08:32.374
Oh. And I will talk to Mitchell.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.349
I miss that $3 bill.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.318
You scheduled your breakup?

08:38.359 --> 08:40.816
Yes, labor day.
That's when I leave for school.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.289
86% of long-distance
relationships end in failure.

08:43.331 --> 08:45.720
It's the only logical course of action.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.556
That is the least romantic thing
I've ever heard.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.058
Stay together.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.560
Wrong. Break up.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.062
College is the sexiest
candy store in the world.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.127
You don't want to show up
with your jaws wired shut.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.366
No, take it from Haley and me.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.369
It's hard to be apart and then together

09:00.374 --> 09:02.409
and then apart and then together

09:02.450 --> 09:04.907
and then apart and then
turned down by the marines

09:04.912 --> 09:06.341
and then together.

09:06.346 --> 09:09.706
Ugh. I can't believe we've got
that dodo back in our lives.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.976
At least Haley's happy.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.420
Honey, could you at least
take that T-shirt off?

09:13.461 --> 09:16.418
They loved it at the deli.
They were kvelling.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.519
Hey-oh!

09:17.524 --> 09:18.859
Andy! Hi.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.856
Sorry to interrupt.
I just want to get these to you.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.691
Here is the closing on baywood. Awesome.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.826
And this is the Johnsons' offer,
all set for signatures.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.167
You've done a real mitzvah, buddy.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.164
I hope that's good.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.837
Oh, hey.

09:30.878 --> 09:32.197
Hey.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.903
I -- it's been awhile
since I've seen you.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.905
Yeah, I've been putting
a lot of hours in,

09:36.910 --> 09:38.907
trying to earn extra money
for this wedding.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.677
Hola. I'm Dylan, Haley's boyfriend.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.250
Uh, hey. I'm Andy.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.548
I didn't realize you two
are back together.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.549
Oh, yeah.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.551
We're like magnets...

09:49.556 --> 09:52.054
...that sometimes take a break
to date other magnets.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.056
What happened was we were together,

09:54.061 --> 09:55.891
and then we were apart.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.056
Thank you so much
for making time for us today.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.062
Oh, I'm sorry it took so long,

10:00.067 --> 10:02.897
but the faculty kind of
scatters for the summer.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.640
I drove my van to Maine
and planted beans.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.540
Let me guess -- and killed a giant.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.040
Chicken! What the -- Joe!

10:12.045 --> 10:13.305
Joe, come back here.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.982
Oh, it's okay.
The chickens won't hurt him.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.550
They're used to the kids.

10:16.591 --> 10:17.779
Chickens are part of this?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.253
We like to utilize
the setting here in the hills,

10:20.294 --> 10:23.218
make nature a part of the experience.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.927
We sometimes see mice or
raccoons or little squirrels.

10:26.968 --> 10:28.587
You know they got traps
for those kind of things.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.425
Ay, I love it. Joe gets to
run around in the fresh air.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.729
Erica, I need you!

10:33.734 --> 10:35.904
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.800
We're out of here.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.802
She's a loon,
letting kids call her "Erica"

10:40.807 --> 10:41.937
like they're poker buddies.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.939
We're too late for anywhere else.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.941
If Bruce Willis can jungle-gym his way

10:45.946 --> 10:48.644
into that fancy school, then I can...

10:48.649 --> 10:50.317
I don't know -- I can cubbie my way in.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.347
They hate their cubbies?
I'll make them new ones.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.021
Cubbies are nothing but little closets.

10:54.062 --> 10:56.018
Ay, but look at Joe. He loves it.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.263
He's chasing after the chickens.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.086
He even caught one. Huh.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.255
Oh, no! No!

11:04.264 --> 11:06.264
No, Joe! Let go!

11:07.934 --> 11:11.437
We will be very happy
to pay for that chicken.

11:11.478 --> 11:13.097
Mitchell, Mitchell!

11:13.106 --> 11:15.436
Look who I bumped
into accidentally by chance.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.671
Hey, stranger.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.006
Charlie!

11:18.011 --> 11:19.641
Ah, I didn't know you painted.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.806
I didn't, either.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.882
It sort of started
as a therapeutic thing,

11:22.923 --> 11:24.817
but then I just really fell for it.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.477
I always wanted to paint.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.646
Damn it!

11:27.654 --> 11:28.988
Why am I not painting?

11:29.029 --> 11:31.118
Well, you're so busy
running your company.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.459
Maybe if you hired more people,
you'd have more time.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.789
I sleep with so many actresses
and models

11:35.795 --> 11:38.455
who are into guys with jets
and boats and ski houses,

11:38.464 --> 11:40.800
but I always wondered,
wouldn't it be more satisfying

11:40.841 --> 11:43.965
to sleep with actresses
and models who are into artists?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.467
Anyway, you were saying how
overwhelmed you were at work.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.807
I'm overwhelmed by this work.

11:47.848 --> 11:50.067
How do you decide what to paint?

11:50.076 --> 11:51.906
You know, I just see
these images in my head,

11:51.911 --> 11:54.409
uh, things I want to see,
places I want to go,

11:54.414 --> 11:56.911
uh, how much paint I have left.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.746
Um, sometimes I just tap
into my emotions,

11:58.751 --> 12:00.920
and I see where that takes me.

12:00.961 --> 12:04.319
And -- you cannot imagine
the sense of contentment.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.159
Imagine how much more
satisfying it would be

12:06.200 --> 12:07.488
after a good day's work.

12:07.493 --> 12:08.828
You know, I came here to talk you

12:08.869 --> 12:10.258
into coming back to the company,

12:10.263 --> 12:13.199
but you're the most at-peace
son of a bitch I've ever met,

12:13.240 --> 12:15.668
and I hired the dalai lama
for a pool party.

12:15.709 --> 12:17.168
Hmm.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.739
Thank you, commander. Mm-hmm.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.908
I will drop these at the office
on the way out of town.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.605
So, unless there's something else?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.840
You're something else.
Claire, get this man a cupcake.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.675
Mm? No, thank you, Mrs. Dunphy.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.049
I've got to fit into
a wedding tux pretty soon.

12:30.090 --> 12:32.179
All right, get out of here.
Happy motoring.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.845
Bye, Andy. See you.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.689
Where's he off to?

12:36.730 --> 12:38.719
Utah for a month to plan his wedding.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.885
I'm kicking myself. Andy is great.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.730
And if I hadn't opened
my big, fat mouth,

12:43.771 --> 12:47.395
Haley might be with him
right now instead of with Dylan.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.230
Hmm.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.932
What? Nothing.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.033
Claire?

12:52.038 --> 12:53.968
Oh, I was just wondering
what would happen

12:53.973 --> 12:57.739
if Andy were to find out
that Haley almost --

12:57.744 --> 12:59.579
no. We are not meddling like that.

12:59.620 --> 13:02.277
No, we're not. Of course we're not.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.779
But you meddled when you called Haley

13:04.784 --> 13:06.452
and told her that Andy liked her.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.121
That's a far cry from telling Andy

13:08.162 --> 13:09.289
Haley was in love with him

13:09.330 --> 13:11.619
and raced to the beach
to stop his proposal.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.923
Luke?

13:15.928 --> 13:16.924
Nope.

13:16.929 --> 13:17.925
Ohh.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.599
I accidentally took your pen.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.768
I didn't want to go plan my wedding

13:21.809 --> 13:23.264
with something so big
weighing on my mind.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.599
Andy, I am really sorry.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.139
I didn't mean for you to hear that.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.936
Do not worry. No big dip!

13:28.941 --> 13:29.937
Really?

13:29.942 --> 13:30.938
Sure!

13:30.943 --> 13:33.112
It's actually kind of funny, you know?

13:33.153 --> 13:34.747
'Cause how crazy is life?

13:34.788 --> 13:36.077
I was all, "should I propose to Beth?

13:36.082 --> 13:37.111
I have feelings for someone else."

13:37.116 --> 13:38.513
Meantime, I was talking about Haley.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.348
Haley apparently had feelings
for me, and I had no clue!

13:41.354 --> 13:44.524
How could you not laugh
at something like that, right?

13:46.192 --> 13:48.361
Oh-oh-oh! Ohh.

13:48.402 --> 13:50.530
Mmm! So good.

13:50.571 --> 13:52.360
All right. Mmm. Happy fourth.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.365
I am so fine.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
_

14:00.842 --> 14:02.710
Hello, hello! Where do I put this?

14:02.751 --> 14:05.040
Hi. Anywhere on the counter
is great, thanks. Hi, dad.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.505
Hey. What's, uh, "e-olve" mean?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.175
Oh, no. It says "evolve".

14:10.183 --> 14:13.281
It's one of Dylan's designs.
The neck is the "v".

14:13.286 --> 14:15.316
There's two v's.
There can't be two necks.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.991
Then why even do it?
Don't make me defend this, dad.

14:18.032 --> 14:19.459
I am just trying to be supportive.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.956
Ignore him. He's just grumpy

14:20.961 --> 14:23.191
because Joe starts school tomorrow.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.526
Well, that's hard
when they leave the nest

14:24.531 --> 14:25.627
for the first time.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.868
I don't care about that.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.365
All I wanted was to bribe
my way into that fancy school

14:30.370 --> 14:32.900
by making cubbies
stuff didn't fall out of.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.710
We can't say more.
Litigation is pending.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.845
All right, who's ready
for my famous chicken salad?

14:44.851 --> 14:46.219
Oh, thank you!

14:46.260 --> 14:48.717
We need the foil back. Right.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.719
Whoa. What happened
to your ear, van gogh?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.559
Oh, I was painting sunflowers outside,

14:52.600 --> 14:53.889
and I got stung by a bee.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.862
You know, I take it as a compliment.

14:55.903 --> 14:57.259
From the bee community?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.832
Oh, my goodness, Claire.
That's one of mine.

14:58.873 --> 15:00.829
Yes, it is.
Oh, that looks so good there.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.570
Right? I just love all the colors.
It makes me feel so happy.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.566
Yeah.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.668
I call it "rape of the immigrant".

15:06.673 --> 15:08.041
I think we left the brownies in the car.

15:08.082 --> 15:10.381
Oh, I'll get those.
Well, way to go, pal.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.342
Okay, what is wrong with you people?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.677
I am dying here,
trying to hold down two jobs

15:16.683 --> 15:18.179
while you enable a once-proud man

15:18.184 --> 15:21.087
who is clearly having
a talent-free breakdown.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.084
You know why he reminds you of van gogh?

15:23.089 --> 15:24.419
It's because he's earning nothing,

15:24.424 --> 15:25.592
and he's losing his mind!

15:25.633 --> 15:29.529
Hey, everybody! Guess who's back?!

15:29.570 --> 15:30.525
Who? Who is back?

15:30.530 --> 15:31.598
Andy.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.928
Andy! Sorry, it took me a second.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.103
No, I know. I -- I'm parting
my hair a little differently.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.900
Yeah. That's one thing
that's new about me.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.965
Uh-huh. So, Beth likes it this way.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.409
I-I love it, looks great.
It looks great.

15:42.450 --> 15:44.077
Thank you.

15:46.118 --> 15:46.574
Hi, Uncle Mitchell.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.977
Hey! Oh, uh -- honey, what's wrong?

15:48.982 --> 15:51.479
Nothing. I-I-I just
said goodbye to Sanjay.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.252
We broke up.

15:53.293 --> 15:54.248
No.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.421
No, it's -- it's -- it's great.

15:55.462 --> 15:57.590
We're -- we're both
going to school unencumbered

15:57.631 --> 15:59.258
and ready to focus.

15:59.299 --> 16:00.755
It's the smart thing to do.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.090
We both feel really good about it.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.425
You don't look like you feel good.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.760
Well, yeah, he was --
he was sadder than I imagined,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.926
so I'm being strong for the both of us,

16:08.935 --> 16:10.765
which he said he admires.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.099
I think.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.601
It was hard to hear him

16:13.606 --> 16:15.466
with all the John legend
and the sobbing.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.439
You know what?

16:18.444 --> 16:19.941
I recently went through
a very hard time,

16:19.946 --> 16:21.906
and I found something
that really helped me

16:21.914 --> 16:22.910
navigate my feelings.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.815
I don't want to paint. Painting.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.151
Oh, my God, right?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.652
I am freaking out.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.654
You don't think that's because
of what he heard us say, do you?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.828
No, lots of people gain weight
during their engagement.

16:35.869 --> 16:36.988
You did. I was pregnant.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.156
I'm trying, Claire.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.599
I don't want to believe
we're responsible.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.928
Of course we're responsible.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.269
Clearly, Andy has been
stuffing his face ever since

16:43.310 --> 16:45.766
he found out that Haley
almost stopped his proposal.

16:45.771 --> 16:46.839
What?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.508
We have got to start
talking in the garage.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.838
Uh, Dylan, could you make me a plate?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.512
If I can make a bong out of a carrot,

16:52.553 --> 16:54.280
I think I can make you a plate.

16:54.321 --> 16:56.849
You told Andy I tried
to stop his proposal?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.117
Not on purpose.

16:58.158 --> 16:59.777
Before he left for Utah,
your father and I

16:59.785 --> 17:02.645
were privately discussing
how bad it would be

17:02.655 --> 17:05.051
if he found out, and Andy overheard us.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.053
What did he say?

17:06.058 --> 17:07.627
He said he was fine. Mm.

17:07.667 --> 17:11.196
But...Now we're not so sure.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.862
Oh, my God.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.027
Oh, my God, that's Andy? Mm-hmm.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.733
You think he got fat 'cause of me?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.498
Possibly. Yes.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.965
Should I talk to him about it?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.570
Honey, that has to be your decision.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.473
We are through meddling
in your love life.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.875
Yeah. Though I will say
he's still very much engaged.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.210
Whereas, I would
want to know if he got fat

17:29.215 --> 17:30.705
because he was still in love with me.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.946
And now we're out.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.882
See, don't you feel better?

17:34.887 --> 17:35.883
No.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.718
Don't stress out about light

17:37.723 --> 17:39.392
and perspective and -- and color.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.657
You know, just let your painting
be what it wants to be.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.097
How's this? Here, let's see.

17:45.138 --> 17:47.194
What the hell? Why are you so good?

17:47.199 --> 17:49.697
I don't know.
I'm just good at most things.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.699
So am I, usually.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.540
Wait a second. So is Sanjay.

17:54.581 --> 17:57.470
I-I-I-I have to get to him
before he leaves.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.680
Wow!

18:00.721 --> 18:03.250
You're really getting better.
Maybe you should go inside.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.377
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, get down from there!

18:07.386 --> 18:09.616
You're gonna get hurt. What happened?

18:09.622 --> 18:11.290
This is why he shouldn't
go to your commune.

18:11.331 --> 18:13.459
He'll fall, those hippies won't notice,

18:13.500 --> 18:15.289
and he'll be eaten alive by chickens.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.562
I think we have established

18:16.603 --> 18:18.731
that he can take care of himself
around a chicken.

18:18.772 --> 18:22.568
You keep forgetting
that Joe is tough. He's part me.

18:22.609 --> 18:25.068
That's the son that you should
be worrying about.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.570
I really thought
I was done with that one.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.276
Hmm.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.409
How's it going?

18:35.414 --> 18:38.250
I got a splinter...
And a few other issues.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.319
You know what's happening here,
don't you?

18:40.360 --> 18:42.049
You're having a mid-life crisis.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.250
Oh, my God.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.252
Some guys, it's fast cars and women.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.087
Me, it was golf.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.729
You, it's just a little gayer.

18:49.770 --> 18:51.759
I know like 10 lesbians
who could out-golf you.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.600
The point is when you're wound
as tight as we are,

18:54.641 --> 18:56.597
you're bound to snap.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.767
Yeah. Yeah, I-I've just been
working so hard for so long.

18:59.772 --> 19:00.968
And now that I've stopped,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.442
I'm -- I'm having
a hard time starting again.

19:03.483 --> 19:04.677
Oh, I get it.

19:04.718 --> 19:07.475
I took six weeks off one summer
just to play golf.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.577
And one day, during
the big club tournament,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.417
I hooked a seven-iron out of bounds.

19:11.458 --> 19:14.582
I got so pissed that
I wrapped the club around a tree

19:14.587 --> 19:17.317
and drove the golf cart off
the little bridge into the lake.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.621
I'll never forget
what the club pro said to me.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.286
"Mr. pritchett,
you're not a very good golfer.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.992
Go back to your day job."

19:24.997 --> 19:25.993
Look...

19:25.998 --> 19:27.828
I know I'm not a good painter, dad.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.831
I -- I was just hoping
to feel a little bit better

19:30.836 --> 19:32.696
before going back to work.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.365
You're not gonna feel better
until you go back to work.

19:35.374 --> 19:37.543
Mitchell, you're a great lawyer.

19:37.584 --> 19:38.839
Go do that.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.013
And get a haircut. Okay.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.848
Hey.

19:42.889 --> 19:44.945
Hey.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.847
So, listen, um,
I heard that you found out

19:46.852 --> 19:48.522
that I was at the beach that day.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.458
Yeah.

19:52.499 --> 19:54.788
I didn't know you felt
that way about me.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.228
Would have been nice to know.

19:56.269 --> 19:57.388
Well, it would have been nice to know

19:57.396 --> 19:58.793
you had feelings for me.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.394
A lot of things would have been nice.

20:00.399 --> 20:03.297
Do you have feelings for me now?

20:03.302 --> 20:06.739
Haley, I'm engaged.

20:06.780 --> 20:08.507
That's not an answer.

20:08.548 --> 20:12.837
Why are you picking now
to talk about all this?

20:12.845 --> 20:15.342
Because I'm worried about all this.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.177
What? My weight?

20:17.183 --> 20:19.819
Please. This will drop off in a second.

20:19.860 --> 20:22.488
Andy, don't you think
that there is a chance

20:22.529 --> 20:23.584
that you have been eating

20:23.589 --> 20:25.257
because you regret
getting engaged to Beth?

20:25.298 --> 20:28.422
Why would I do that? Beth is amazing.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.225
Beth is a psycho who tried
to light my hair on fire.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.728
Meanwhile, Dylan is in the backyard

20:33.733 --> 20:35.830
trying to make a plate out of sticks.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.095
Well, at least he knows
what he wants and goes for it.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.072
Then I guess it's a good thing
that we didn't get together.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.368
Best decision I ever made!

20:41.373 --> 20:42.513
Samesies!

20:46.946 --> 20:48.606
I'm not gonna lie, Phil.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.111
I might need to get back into that.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.176
Yep.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.000
_

20:56.122 --> 20:57.518
Sanjay!

20:57.523 --> 20:59.020
Oh, God. I can't say goodbye again.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.185
We don't have to.

21:00.193 --> 21:02.262
We're basing this decision
on a statistic.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.259
86% percent
of long-distance relationships

21:04.264 --> 21:05.932
end in failure, correct?
Of course "correct".

21:05.973 --> 21:07.100
You'd never misquote a statistic.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.096
And neither would you.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.197
When have we ever been

21:09.202 --> 21:11.599
in the bottom 86th percentile
of anything?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.707
Never. I'd kill myself.
We're in the top 1%.

21:14.748 --> 21:17.737
Exactly. I learned how to
paint in an afternoon.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.313
Last night, I developed an app
to feed my fish from college.

21:20.354 --> 21:24.217
If anyone can make this work,
it's you and me.

21:24.258 --> 21:25.377
God, I love numbers.

21:25.385 --> 21:29.015
I love numbers, too.
