NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:34.375 --> 00:38.458
SPAIN, 19TH CENTURY.

00:38.541 --> 00:42.916
SUCCESSIVE WARS LEFT
THE COUNTRY WOUNDED.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.333
SOME PEOPLE DECIDED
TO ISOLATE THEMSELVES

00:45.416 --> 00:47.166
TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE AND MADNESS.

00:47.250 --> 00:51.916
ISOLATE

02:10.958 --> 02:11.791
Mom.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.208
-What?
-My potty has broken.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.500
Okay, we'll make another one.

02:18.375 --> 02:19.875
Do you want to go to the latrine?

02:20.916 --> 02:22.041
Salvador…

02:25.625 --> 02:26.750
Right.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.250
Come on.

03:35.791 --> 03:36.625
Come out!

03:41.791 --> 03:42.791
Hurry!

03:44.791 --> 03:45.875
Come out now!

03:57.958 --> 03:59.041
Come on, Diego.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.125
Sweetheart?

04:27.833 --> 04:29.875
What's wrong? Can't you sleep?

04:31.958 --> 04:32.958
Go on, get in.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.708
Your feet are cold!

04:37.791 --> 04:38.791
Yours are too.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.875
No, yours are colder.

04:40.958 --> 04:42.208
No, yours are.

05:04.416 --> 05:05.291
Do it like I did.

05:09.708 --> 05:10.833
Go on, Diego. Hit it.

05:12.708 --> 05:13.708
Hit it.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.500
Hit it. Hit it hard!

05:18.250 --> 05:19.291
Don't be afraid!

05:20.625 --> 05:22.291
Come on now! Come on, Diego!

05:24.666 --> 05:25.583
No!

05:35.125 --> 05:36.125
No!

06:03.583 --> 06:04.583
Diego!

06:09.833 --> 06:13.458
-Don't do it if you don't want to.
-He has to learn to be a man.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.750
But it doesn't have to be today.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.166
Yes, it has to be today. Come here, Diego.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.333
Come here, son.
Help me peel some potatoes.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Come on.

06:36.208 --> 06:37.375
-Potatoes!
-Okay.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.791
Look, take a look. The leaves here…

06:41.375 --> 06:42.375
are fine.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.416
Son, pay attention. Look. See?

06:46.500 --> 06:49.333
So, inside here…
are the greenflies. See?

06:51.791 --> 06:53.791
-Hmm… Mom.
-What?

06:53.875 --> 06:56.750
What will happen to the rabbit
that crossed the boundaries?

07:01.625 --> 07:03.916
What are the posts
your father planted for?

07:05.791 --> 07:08.416
To remind us that beyond,
there is only war.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.125
Then nothing good can happen to him.

07:18.875 --> 07:19.916
What about people?

07:21.208 --> 07:24.708
Do they die like the rabbits
and goats from the corral?

07:27.166 --> 07:28.208
What do you mean?

07:28.708 --> 07:30.958
Are they gone forever?

07:32.708 --> 07:33.666
Yes.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.083
You never see them again?

07:37.208 --> 07:40.875
Well, if you close your eyes,
you can always see them.

07:42.541 --> 07:45.333
Shall we go feed the rabbits? Come on!

07:50.875 --> 07:51.916
Come in, son.

07:52.958 --> 07:53.833
Hello!

07:54.333 --> 07:55.708
How did you sleep?

07:56.833 --> 07:59.625
Sleep well? Anyway, here's your breakfast.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.500
Wait… Hang on, hang on!

08:03.583 --> 08:04.666
Hold it there!

08:07.875 --> 08:11.625
Oh, my… Oh, my God!
You held your breath for ages, son!

08:11.708 --> 08:15.708
-How long?
-Twenty-three. You're getting a fish face.

08:15.791 --> 08:20.208
How have they been treating you, Lion?
Well, I'll tell them, Lion.

08:21.291 --> 08:23.291
Because you're still little.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.083
Like this, then this and this.

08:25.666 --> 08:29.125
Like this, then this and then this.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.875
-Wanna race?
-Okay.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.166
Diego!

10:04.125 --> 10:07.250
What are you doing there spying on me?
Come in.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.583
What's with the dress?

10:09.458 --> 10:13.833
Your father gave me this dress as a gift.
He made it before we came here.

10:13.916 --> 10:15.708
Why don't you ever wear it?

10:32.041 --> 10:32.875
Make a wish.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.458
Let's see.

11:04.583 --> 11:05.916
I don't know how to use it.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.958
It's very easy. Look.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.666
With this lever, you open it.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.666
Load a cartridge in here.

11:20.666 --> 11:21.791
The other one here.

11:22.958 --> 11:23.958
Close it.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.916
Hold it firmly, then aim.

11:31.958 --> 11:32.958
And fire.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Got it?

11:35.833 --> 11:37.250
-Yes, Dad.
-Let's try it.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.250
It's a gift for when you're older.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.958
-He's old enough.
-No, he's not.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.125
Diego, come with me.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.916
Diego… Do you want my present?

12:04.166 --> 12:05.541
I can't go any further.

12:07.791 --> 12:09.041
Put it on your ear.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.083
Right away.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.166
I spy…

12:18.041 --> 12:19.291
You have to answer.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.625
-I spy…
-What do you see?

12:24.916 --> 12:26.083
A little something.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.500
What color is it?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.875
The color is…

12:36.250 --> 12:40.000
So that same night,
a knock on the door startled them.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.833
"María…

12:42.541 --> 12:46.083
give me back the guts you took from me!"

12:46.916 --> 12:49.666
And he said, "Mommy, who could that be?"

12:50.291 --> 12:51.833
"Shut up, son. He'll go away."

12:51.916 --> 12:53.833
"I'm not leaving,

12:53.916 --> 12:57.125
because the stairs I'm already climbing."

12:59.333 --> 13:00.791
Then… Oh!

13:02.750 --> 13:05.416
Somebody was scraping on the windows.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.833
Heavy breathing by the foot of the bed.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.708
"María, give me back the guts
you took from me!"

13:14.625 --> 13:16.583
That scared you, didn't it?

13:16.666 --> 13:18.166
Tell me another story.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.291
Okay. Which one?

13:19.375 --> 13:22.250
-The one with the shepherd and the ogre?
-No…

13:22.333 --> 13:24.791
The one with the three-haired devil?

13:24.875 --> 13:25.833
Legend has it…

13:27.458 --> 13:30.041
-that there is an evil beast.
-Not that one, please.

13:35.625 --> 13:39.541
There is an evil beast
that roams the world,

13:39.625 --> 13:41.583
seeking out the weakest people.

13:41.666 --> 13:42.541
Salvador…

13:42.625 --> 13:44.416
Don't interrupt me again.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.583
It's a tall being,

13:50.125 --> 13:52.625
it has hollow cheekbones…

13:56.375 --> 13:58.958
and it has no eyes in its sockets.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.416
But it looks right at you.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.750
When the beast finds a victim,

14:06.833 --> 14:08.916
it follows it around, slowly.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.375
The more you fear it, the closer it gets.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.416
Understand?

14:19.708 --> 14:21.458
It feeds on our fear.

14:26.416 --> 14:28.333
People say it's a lie,

14:28.416 --> 14:30.000
but I know it isn't.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.583
-My sister--
-Salvador, please. That's enough.

14:38.583 --> 14:39.875
Dad, did she see it?

14:39.958 --> 14:42.666
I said that's enough!
Come on, time for bed.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.500
Let's go. Bedtime.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.000
Dad!

15:33.541 --> 15:34.583
Dad!

15:58.708 --> 15:59.875
Get in the house.

16:18.791 --> 16:20.041
Diego, go home!

16:46.416 --> 16:47.375
What are you doing?

16:49.708 --> 16:50.875
He ran out of bullets.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.000
-Take the boy away!
-What are you going to do?

17:05.083 --> 17:06.041
Heal his wounds.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.333
Salvador, please…

17:07.416 --> 17:09.208
What if he was running away?

17:12.041 --> 17:13.375
Come on, let's go.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.916
<i>-Is he coming home?</i>
<i>-Of course not.</i>

17:21.416 --> 17:23.375
Other men did this to him.

17:25.625 --> 17:26.625
Yes.

17:27.875 --> 17:28.875
Do you know why?

17:29.958 --> 17:32.791
Because there are only bad people
out there, who hurt others.

17:47.833 --> 17:48.958
Shall we sing?

17:50.041 --> 17:52.541
<i>Marlborough has left for the war</i>

17:52.625 --> 17:54.625
<i>Mironton, mironton, mirontaine…</i>

17:54.708 --> 17:56.041
Come on, sing along.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.625
<i>Marlborough has left for the war</i>

17:58.708 --> 18:01.291
<i>Mironton, mironton, mirontaine</i>

18:01.375 --> 18:03.416
<i>Marlborough has left for the war</i>

18:03.500 --> 18:05.541
<i>But when will he ever come back?</i>

18:05.625 --> 18:07.916
<i>Mironton, mironton, mirontaine</i>

18:08.000 --> 18:10.625
<i>But when will he ever come back?</i>

18:12.000 --> 18:13.250
Have you unbraided it?

18:13.333 --> 18:16.291
-Yes, but I didn't do it properly.
-No, start over.

18:16.916 --> 18:19.708
<i>-Marlborough has left for Easter…</i>
<i>-For the war</i>

18:19.791 --> 18:22.333
<i>Marlborough has left for Easter</i>

18:22.416 --> 18:24.750
<i>Mironton, mironton, mirontaine</i>

18:24.833 --> 18:27.041
<i>Marlborough has left for Easter</i>

18:27.125 --> 18:29.916
<i>But when will he ever come back?</i>
<i>Mironton…</i>

18:30.000 --> 18:31.541
Let me do it.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.875
<i>Mironton, mironton, mirontaine</i>

18:33.958 --> 18:36.625
<i>But when will he ever come back?</i>

18:37.208 --> 18:39.166
<i>Marlborough has left for the…</i>

18:39.250 --> 18:40.791
It's tangled up.

19:06.916 --> 19:07.916
Mom!

20:13.875 --> 20:18.041
What are you going to do with the body?
Huh? Are you going to bury it?

20:21.250 --> 20:24.625
Put him in the boat, float downstream.
That's what you should do.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.333
I don't want that monster here.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.291
Is that his family?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.208
-They must be looking--
-Diego, to your room!

21:09.375 --> 21:10.375
Don't touch that.

21:51.833 --> 21:53.416
What happened to your sister?

21:56.166 --> 21:57.166
Your grandparents…

22:00.500 --> 22:04.500
always treated my sister… very badly.

22:06.166 --> 22:07.083
Very badly.

22:08.333 --> 22:12.458
At night, my sister and I played
at telling each other scary tales,

22:13.125 --> 22:15.750
and that made us feel a bit braver.

22:16.708 --> 22:19.375
One night, she said, "Salvador, Salvador."

22:19.458 --> 22:21.166
"Sometimes I see the beast."

22:26.208 --> 22:28.666
"The first time I saw it, it was far away…

22:31.333 --> 22:33.708
but each day it gets a little bit closer."

22:35.708 --> 22:37.583
"Right now it's down there," she said.

22:38.583 --> 22:41.791
I went to the window,
but there was nothing down there.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.791
So I went back to bed.

22:44.375 --> 22:47.916
But Juana said, "Salvador…

22:50.416 --> 22:52.083
even though you can't see it…

22:54.041 --> 22:55.583
the beast is there."

22:57.458 --> 22:58.875
A few days later,

22:58.958 --> 23:01.708
she came running to my bed,
crying and crying.

23:01.791 --> 23:05.541
And she said, "Salvador,
the beast has just entered the room."

23:05.625 --> 23:08.916
"It's behind the wardrobe.
Please! It's coming for me."

23:10.666 --> 23:12.958
"Let me sleep with you. I'm scared."

23:13.916 --> 23:15.250
"Don't be a coward."

23:16.458 --> 23:18.333
"Go to bed and let me sleep."

23:19.541 --> 23:20.833
When I woke up,

23:21.416 --> 23:23.666
I saw Juana leaning out the window…

23:25.291 --> 23:26.625
looking at the horizon.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.875
Then she jumped out.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.291
Did you see the beast?

23:40.625 --> 23:42.458
Did the man in the boat see it?

23:45.375 --> 23:46.750
Once you see the beast…

23:49.166 --> 23:51.041
you're doomed forever.

24:05.250 --> 24:06.583
Tell me the truth.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.583
Please, Salvador, it's dangerous.

24:08.666 --> 24:11.041
Do you want to end up being killed?

24:11.125 --> 24:13.291
I must take him back to his family, okay?

24:13.375 --> 24:16.208
Make up another excuse,
but don't lie to me!

24:16.291 --> 24:17.416
What are you doing?

24:19.500 --> 24:20.500
Dad?

24:22.166 --> 24:23.291
Where are you going?

24:23.375 --> 24:25.333
His wife and his son are looking for him.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.125
Is he leaving?

24:29.708 --> 24:30.833
It's dangerous, Dad.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.291
I'll be fine.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.125
You can't go on your own.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.541
There's only bad people
beyond our property, Dad.

24:37.625 --> 24:38.625
They'll kill you.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.500
Salvador…

24:41.291 --> 24:42.291
Salvador…

24:45.083 --> 24:47.166
We'll be waiting for you, you hear?

24:47.666 --> 24:50.041
We'll be waiting for you. Did you hear me?

24:50.125 --> 24:53.083
If I can't find them
after a couple of days, I'll…

24:54.208 --> 24:55.583
-Take him inside.
-Salvador…

24:55.666 --> 24:56.750
Take him inside!

24:57.708 --> 25:00.541
It's okay. We'll be fine, sweetheart.

25:05.791 --> 25:06.791
It's okay.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.250
It's okay.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.541
It's okay. Take it easy.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.250
Take it easy. Take it easy.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.958
No, Diego! Diego!

25:22.583 --> 25:23.583
Dad!

25:24.750 --> 25:25.750
Dad.

25:51.833 --> 25:54.916
Take care of your mother, you hear?
Take care of her.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.916
<i>Mr. Federico killed his wife</i>

26:50.000 --> 26:53.125
<i>He made mincemeat of her</i>
<i>And put her in the frying pan</i>

26:53.208 --> 26:56.333
<i>The people who passed by</i>
<i>Could smell roast meat</i>

26:56.416 --> 26:57.666
<i>It was his wife</i>

27:10.000 --> 27:11.208
What's wrong, son?

27:13.250 --> 27:15.916
Do you want to go to the latrine? Yeah?

27:17.666 --> 27:18.750
Me too.

28:27.958 --> 28:29.916
Don't make me laugh or I'll miss.

28:57.291 --> 28:59.166
-We'll start counting now.
-Okay.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.458
One, two,

29:01.541 --> 29:02.958
three,

29:03.041 --> 29:05.375
four, five…

29:06.750 --> 29:08.666
See? Now it's far away.

29:08.750 --> 29:12.083
<i>Mr. Federico killed his wife</i>

29:12.166 --> 29:15.208
<i>He made mincemeat of her</i>
<i>And put her in the frying pan</i>

29:15.291 --> 29:18.458
<i>The people who passed by</i>
<i>Could smell roast meat</i>

29:18.541 --> 29:20.125
<i>It was his wife</i>

29:20.750 --> 29:21.916
I'm winning!

29:24.083 --> 29:25.125
Come on!

29:40.125 --> 29:41.541
No, he's not angry.

29:41.625 --> 29:45.291
Beyond the property, there are only
bad people. He's fighting them.

29:46.125 --> 29:47.875
<i>Once he's killed them, he'll return.</i>

29:53.958 --> 29:56.458
<i>Now we must take care of Mom, okay?</i>

30:00.041 --> 30:03.375
No, you can wait longer.
Just one more day.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.416
<i>Just one more day.</i>

30:11.416 --> 30:13.166
<i>He'll be back one day.</i>

30:14.791 --> 30:16.250
<i>There isn't long to go.</i>

30:19.458 --> 30:20.833
<i>Just one more day.</i>

30:39.458 --> 30:40.583
Happy birthday.

30:43.666 --> 30:44.583
I forgot.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.000
Shall we get up?

30:48.083 --> 30:49.375
Let me sleep, son.

31:29.541 --> 31:30.833
Make a wish.

31:39.583 --> 31:41.250
It will come true, I'm sure.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.541
Thank you, son.

31:54.916 --> 31:57.500
-Wanna play?
-I don't feel like playing, son.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.250
Please.

32:10.708 --> 32:11.833
You go first!

32:13.166 --> 32:14.416
I don't feel like it.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.541
Of course,
because you're going to lose, as usual!

32:19.291 --> 32:20.291
I spy…

32:20.875 --> 32:22.000
What do you see?

32:22.500 --> 32:23.583
A little something.

32:24.791 --> 32:26.083
What color is it?

32:30.375 --> 32:31.500
What color is it?

32:33.291 --> 32:34.291
Mom!

32:35.000 --> 32:37.250
-Diego, get in the house!
-What?

32:38.625 --> 32:40.916
Get in the house, son. Come on.

32:46.250 --> 32:47.250
What's there?

32:48.791 --> 32:49.791
I don't know.

32:54.541 --> 32:55.541
Let's go.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.208
Let's go, son.

33:05.625 --> 33:06.625
Come on.

33:26.416 --> 33:27.416
Diego.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.375
Have you seen the beast?

34:55.916 --> 34:56.916
It's coming.

35:07.791 --> 35:08.916
What are you doing?

35:29.833 --> 35:30.916
Did you hear that?

35:31.875 --> 35:32.958
What?

35:33.041 --> 35:34.250
There it is again.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.500
Fetch the shotgun.
Fetch the shotgun, Diego!

35:40.208 --> 35:41.458
Diego! Fetch the shotgun!

35:43.958 --> 35:45.166
Give me the shotgun.

35:47.750 --> 35:49.291
-What if it's Dad?
-It's not.

35:50.833 --> 35:51.833
Is it Dad?

35:53.541 --> 35:56.541
Do you see it? There!
Hiding behind the scarecrow.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.333
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

36:07.541 --> 36:08.833
It's still there!

36:18.625 --> 36:20.541
Hurry! I've run out of bullets!

36:26.375 --> 36:27.208
Stay here.

36:27.291 --> 36:29.583
-Where are you going, Mom?
-Stay here!

36:29.666 --> 36:30.708
Mom!

36:33.250 --> 36:34.250
Mom!

36:37.291 --> 36:38.416
Mom!

36:42.541 --> 36:43.791
Mom!

36:44.416 --> 36:45.625
Mom!

36:46.750 --> 36:48.541
Mom, come back!

36:50.291 --> 36:51.625
Mom!

36:57.291 --> 36:58.458
Mom!

36:58.541 --> 36:59.958
Come back, Mom!

37:06.125 --> 37:07.708
Mom!

37:09.166 --> 37:10.250
Mom!

37:11.791 --> 37:13.791
-Mom!
-I lost it. I lost it.

37:16.875 --> 37:18.166
I think I scared it.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.291
It's over, it's over.

37:21.791 --> 37:23.375
It's over, come on.

37:24.125 --> 37:25.208
It's over.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.541
Can you help me, Mom?

38:05.500 --> 38:07.791
-Where are you going?
-To the corral.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.208
No, you can't go out.

38:11.875 --> 38:12.875
Diego!

38:13.500 --> 38:15.000
Who's in charge here?

38:16.916 --> 38:18.125
I'm talking to you!

38:19.583 --> 38:21.291
Mom, may I go to the corral?

38:21.958 --> 38:22.791
No.

38:25.041 --> 38:25.958
Wait.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.583
The storm must have dragged it
to the door.

39:13.166 --> 39:14.458
It's a disaster.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.750
What's wrong?

39:47.041 --> 39:48.500
Why did you do that, Bull?

39:49.750 --> 39:50.750
Don't say that!

39:52.500 --> 39:53.375
That's not true.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.458
He'll be back soon.

39:59.125 --> 40:00.125
Pick one.

40:03.958 --> 40:06.791
-I don't want to.
-Me neither, but we have to.

40:10.833 --> 40:11.666
No way.

40:11.750 --> 40:14.333
Diego, do you want us to starve to death?

40:15.916 --> 40:17.458
If you don't pick, I will.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.333
-Shall I?
-No, I'll pick.

40:27.833 --> 40:28.666
Bull.

40:37.708 --> 40:38.833
Diego, help me!

40:40.708 --> 40:41.791
Please.

40:42.916 --> 40:44.500
Diego, help me. Please.

40:56.791 --> 40:57.875
Diego, please eat.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.375
Diego, where are you going? Diego!

41:11.458 --> 41:13.791
You have to ask me
for permission to go out!

41:13.875 --> 41:15.791
I'm your mother and you must obey me!

41:22.291 --> 41:23.958
I know that you're angry.

41:24.708 --> 41:27.291
But we have a lot of work to do,
and you have to eat.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.208
Stay still.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.708
Stay still, don't move.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.791
It's there.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.458
It's there.

42:20.041 --> 42:20.875
Mom?

42:26.166 --> 42:27.291
Mom?

42:37.791 --> 42:38.833
Go away!

42:39.875 --> 42:41.375
What do you want from us?

42:42.125 --> 42:43.416
Leave us alone!

42:45.375 --> 42:46.416
Go away!

42:59.291 --> 43:00.458
Get out of here!

43:03.083 --> 43:04.583
Leave us alone!

43:15.583 --> 43:16.500
What happened?

43:16.583 --> 43:17.916
What was it, Mom?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
I don't know.

43:20.458 --> 43:21.458
It…

43:22.208 --> 43:25.958
I guess it has hidden there,
behind the… the bushes.

43:26.041 --> 43:27.791
It was closer than yesterday, right?

43:28.416 --> 43:29.583
Yes, it was closer.

43:31.125 --> 43:33.625
The beast did the same with Dad's sister.

43:35.291 --> 43:38.166
Those are just tales.
The beast doesn't exist.

43:38.250 --> 43:40.750
-Juana died--
-Aunt Juana was sick in the head

43:40.833 --> 43:44.500
because her parents beat her up.
That's why she killed herself.

44:18.541 --> 44:19.583
What are you doing?

44:23.625 --> 44:25.458
Come on.
<i>Mr. Federico…</i>

44:25.541 --> 44:27.416
I don't feel like playing, Diego.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.375
Come on.

44:31.458 --> 44:33.166
<i>Mr. Federico…</i>

44:36.500 --> 44:39.833
<i>-Mr. Federico killed his wife--</i>
-Enough, enough.

44:47.416 --> 44:48.500
What was that?

45:14.541 --> 45:16.166
-Unlock the door.
-No.

45:16.250 --> 45:18.083
Come on. Come on.

46:10.125 --> 46:11.416
It's Dad's horse.

46:15.458 --> 46:16.708
Dad!

46:18.875 --> 46:19.958
Dad!

46:24.000 --> 46:25.083
Dad!

46:29.541 --> 46:30.541
Dad?

46:39.625 --> 46:40.833
Dad!

46:45.000 --> 46:46.250
Dad!

46:55.208 --> 46:56.458
Dad!

47:54.875 --> 47:57.208
Did you see it? Did you see it?

47:57.833 --> 47:59.333
-Mom…
-It was right there.

48:02.875 --> 48:03.958
It was right there.

48:04.958 --> 48:06.500
At the door, about to enter.

48:07.625 --> 48:11.125
I shot it point-blank and it was
still standing there, not moving.

48:12.333 --> 48:13.416
It was tall.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.208
Tall, thin…

48:17.125 --> 48:20.541
And its body, its hands, its eyes…

48:21.333 --> 48:22.583
Dad's bags!

48:33.375 --> 48:35.458
He ran out of bullets.
He isn't coming back.

48:35.541 --> 48:37.541
Mom, let's help him.

48:37.625 --> 48:38.833
He isn't coming back!

48:40.083 --> 48:41.583
Got it? He's not coming back!

48:54.875 --> 48:56.750
It won't stop until it kills us.

48:57.875 --> 48:59.500
I'm not letting it in here.

49:27.541 --> 49:29.041
-Diego!
-The rabbits!

49:29.125 --> 49:30.208
Diego!

49:35.250 --> 49:36.458
Run, Diego!

49:51.083 --> 49:52.083
Diego!

50:01.541 --> 50:03.250
Never do that again.

50:27.833 --> 50:29.666
You have to stab it here…

50:34.958 --> 50:37.333
Here, hard…

50:42.208 --> 50:43.208
Here…

50:46.250 --> 50:47.500
And here.

50:50.666 --> 50:51.750
Look at me, Diego.

50:52.875 --> 50:53.958
Look at me, Diego!

50:55.375 --> 50:57.041
You have to kill it quickly.

50:58.291 --> 51:00.458
Plunge the knife all the way in.

51:01.208 --> 51:02.458
Twist and pull it out.

51:02.541 --> 51:04.416
If you're not sure you've killed it,

51:04.500 --> 51:06.666
you cut the jugular. Got it?

51:10.791 --> 51:11.833
I'd rather shoot.

51:16.416 --> 51:19.791
See these two bullets?
They're the only ones we have left.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.291
Stand up and come here.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.041
Diego, that's an order!

51:28.125 --> 51:29.125
Come on.

51:30.625 --> 51:31.625
Come on.

51:35.291 --> 51:36.333
Hold the knife.

51:39.333 --> 51:41.708
Diego, hold the knife. Come on, come on.

51:41.791 --> 51:44.708
There. Mark the four points. There.

51:48.958 --> 51:49.958
Come on.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.458
You're a coward.

51:58.791 --> 51:59.625
Coward.

52:04.166 --> 52:06.041
Where are you going? Diego.

52:06.125 --> 52:07.375
Diego, come here.

52:14.166 --> 52:15.166
Here…

52:18.125 --> 52:19.125
here…

52:22.666 --> 52:23.666
here…

52:26.125 --> 52:27.125
and here.

52:31.791 --> 52:32.791
Got it?

52:55.375 --> 52:57.083
<i>Don't be afraid of her, Lion.</i>

53:01.166 --> 53:02.541
<i>She's just afraid.</i>

53:06.333 --> 53:07.333
<i>No!</i>

53:08.583 --> 53:10.041
<i>Mom wants to protect us.</i>

53:22.208 --> 53:23.750
<i>There's nothing out there?</i>

53:24.833 --> 53:25.916
<i>What do you know?</i>

53:32.791 --> 53:34.083
<i>Be patient, Lion.</i>

53:36.166 --> 53:37.333
<i>Everything will pass.</i>

53:43.708 --> 53:45.125
<i>If we take care of her,</i>

53:45.875 --> 53:46.958
<i>she'll be fine.</i>

54:01.791 --> 54:03.958
<i>We just have to hold on one more day.</i>

54:12.083 --> 54:13.500
<i>Just one more day, Lion.</i>

54:16.000 --> 54:17.125
<i>Just one more day.</i>

54:42.541 --> 54:43.375
Do you hear it?

54:45.458 --> 54:46.416
It's howling.

55:12.791 --> 55:14.250
Come here. Come.

55:17.500 --> 55:20.833
I heard footsteps on the roof.
This is our chance.

55:22.416 --> 55:23.750
It won't see it coming.

55:24.625 --> 55:26.666
-Take the shotgun and go up there.
-No.

55:26.750 --> 55:29.708
Climb up the chimney, I'm too big.
Go on! I'm too big!

55:29.791 --> 55:30.791
No.

55:32.875 --> 55:33.791
Your father would.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.416
Come on, son. Don't miss.

55:45.875 --> 55:46.833
Go on then.

55:57.625 --> 55:58.625
Hurry.

56:02.958 --> 56:04.041
Get up!

56:27.833 --> 56:29.666
Mom, I can't!

56:29.750 --> 56:30.750
Keep going.

56:31.625 --> 56:33.208
-Mom!
-Keep going!

56:36.208 --> 56:37.750
There's nothing here, Mom!

56:42.750 --> 56:43.750
Mom!

56:49.250 --> 56:50.541
Mom, I see something!

56:56.666 --> 56:57.791
Mom!

56:58.625 --> 56:59.625
Mom!

57:00.250 --> 57:01.250
Mom!

57:03.833 --> 57:04.833
Mom!

57:05.416 --> 57:06.333
Mom!

57:06.416 --> 57:07.666
Help me, Mom!

57:27.291 --> 57:29.375
-We only have one bullet.
-It's there. Move.

57:29.458 --> 57:31.875
-We shoot when it's in front of us.
-Move!

57:31.958 --> 57:32.958
No!

57:54.458 --> 57:55.458
Mom?

58:03.375 --> 58:04.375
Mom?

58:09.583 --> 58:10.583
Don't touch me!

58:18.375 --> 58:20.458
Just leave me alone. You stink.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.583
So do you.

58:34.041 --> 58:36.416
Let's see who can stay underwater
the longest.

58:37.458 --> 58:38.291
Huh?

58:38.791 --> 58:40.250
-I'm cold.
-You go first.

58:41.083 --> 58:44.041
Come on, son. You go first.
Come on now. Come on.

58:46.833 --> 58:48.458
So now you're a coward?

58:49.375 --> 58:50.791
-No.
-Come on.

58:51.875 --> 58:52.875
Come on.

58:54.583 --> 58:55.958
One, two…

58:57.916 --> 58:59.416
You didn't last at all, son.

59:03.708 --> 59:06.333
One, two, three,

59:06.958 --> 59:10.333
four, five, six,

59:10.416 --> 59:14.041
seven, eight, nine,

59:14.125 --> 59:17.583
ten, eleven, twelve,

59:17.666 --> 59:20.958
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,

59:21.041 --> 59:24.833
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

59:24.916 --> 59:28.541
nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,

59:28.625 --> 59:32.416
twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four,

59:32.500 --> 59:36.416
twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven,

59:36.500 --> 59:40.375
twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty,

59:40.458 --> 59:44.625
thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three,

59:44.708 --> 59:47.916
thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five…

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Mom?

59:53.208 --> 59:54.375
Come up now!

1:00:03.541 --> 1:00:06.416
What are you doing?
I could have stayed under longer.

1:00:07.875 --> 1:00:09.750
I beat you. Huh?

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:12.333
I'm a fish face.

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.416
Don't say that again
or I'll tell her to eat you.

1:00:30.125 --> 1:00:31.125
You're right.

1:00:32.250 --> 1:00:33.916
We have to take her weapons away.

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:39.291
One, two…

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:53.041
One, two, three.

1:02:10.541 --> 1:02:11.875
One…

1:02:13.333 --> 1:02:14.750
two…

1:02:17.541 --> 1:02:18.875
three.

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.083
What are you doing?

1:02:32.125 --> 1:02:33.666
-Give me the shotgun.
-No.

1:02:35.333 --> 1:02:37.291
-Diego, give me the shotgun!
-No!

1:02:39.583 --> 1:02:40.916
-Give it to me.
-No.

1:02:43.583 --> 1:02:45.458
-What are you doing?
-I'll slit my throat.

1:02:45.541 --> 1:02:46.500
Stop it, Mom.

1:02:46.583 --> 1:02:48.208
-I'll slit my throat!
-Mom, stop!

1:02:48.291 --> 1:02:49.250
Give it to me!

1:02:55.958 --> 1:02:57.333
Diego! The bullet! Diego!

1:02:58.208 --> 1:02:59.333
Open the door!

1:03:00.291 --> 1:03:01.625
I said open the door!

1:03:01.708 --> 1:03:02.583
Open the door!

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.250
I said open the door!

1:03:08.458 --> 1:03:09.333
Diego!

1:03:09.916 --> 1:03:10.875
Diego!

1:03:59.083 --> 1:04:00.083
Don't be mean.

1:04:01.458 --> 1:04:02.458
Are you sure?

1:04:09.083 --> 1:04:10.500
I can't take it anymore.

1:04:12.208 --> 1:04:13.625
I can't take it anymore.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.541
Come in here and light my fire, dead man.

1:04:20.916 --> 1:04:21.958
No.

1:04:24.125 --> 1:04:25.833
It's getting closer.

1:04:26.833 --> 1:04:28.208
Closer and closer.

1:04:31.208 --> 1:04:32.583
Closer and closer.

1:04:33.583 --> 1:04:34.583
Closer.

1:04:38.625 --> 1:04:40.625
I have so many things to tell you.

1:04:42.166 --> 1:04:43.583
Please come back to me.

1:04:44.791 --> 1:04:46.500
I really miss you.

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:13.291
It says it's going to come in.

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.083
Mom!

1:06:36.791 --> 1:06:38.166
I'm sorry, Lion.

1:07:08.333 --> 1:07:09.833
Untie me.

1:07:20.041 --> 1:07:21.333
Untie me, baby.

1:07:23.791 --> 1:07:24.791
Please, Diego.

1:07:26.333 --> 1:07:27.791
Untie me, please.

1:07:31.666 --> 1:07:33.958
Please. I don't want any.

1:07:34.041 --> 1:07:35.958
-Eat.
-I don't want to eat.

1:07:36.583 --> 1:07:38.166
-Eat.
-I don't want to eat.

1:07:39.750 --> 1:07:41.000
Eat, Mom.

1:07:41.083 --> 1:07:42.083
Eat.

1:07:47.708 --> 1:07:48.708
Where is he?

1:07:50.791 --> 1:07:52.291
Please tell him to come.

1:07:52.375 --> 1:07:55.750
-Lie down, Mom. Lie down, Mom.
-Tell him to come.

1:07:55.833 --> 1:07:57.916
-Lie down.
-Please tell him to come.

1:07:59.583 --> 1:08:00.708
Lie down, Mom.

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:03.541
Tell him to come.

1:08:05.708 --> 1:08:08.250
Tell him to come, baby. Tell him to come.

1:08:12.750 --> 1:08:13.958
Tell him to come.

1:08:14.041 --> 1:08:15.083
Don't worry.

1:08:15.166 --> 1:08:17.125
-Where is he?
-Don't worry.

1:08:19.250 --> 1:08:20.250
Where is he?

1:08:22.875 --> 1:08:24.250
Tell him to come.

1:08:24.750 --> 1:08:25.916
Don't worry, Mom.

1:08:29.333 --> 1:08:30.416
Where is he?

1:10:33.833 --> 1:10:35.083
I spy…

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.291
Get up, Mom!

1:10:58.375 --> 1:11:00.875
Up, up, up! We have to get out.

1:11:01.875 --> 1:11:04.041
Come on! Get up!

1:11:04.833 --> 1:11:07.000
Come on! Get up!

1:11:21.958 --> 1:11:25.000
Don't move. Don't do anything.
I'll distract it.

1:12:30.875 --> 1:12:32.125
Mom, where are you?

1:12:36.083 --> 1:12:37.083
Mom?

1:12:47.791 --> 1:12:48.791
Mom?

1:12:56.291 --> 1:12:57.291
Mom?

1:14:04.416 --> 1:14:05.375
Mom?

1:14:07.375 --> 1:14:08.375
Diego.

1:14:10.125 --> 1:14:11.625
Would you like to sit with us?

1:14:36.666 --> 1:14:38.125
No work tomorrow, eh?

1:14:39.708 --> 1:14:41.708
We could go swimming in the river.

1:14:43.208 --> 1:14:44.416
Have a water fight.

1:14:45.666 --> 1:14:46.583
If you want?

1:14:51.750 --> 1:14:52.833
Son…

1:14:57.166 --> 1:14:58.333
I need to pee.

1:14:59.833 --> 1:15:00.666
Can you go?

1:15:02.583 --> 1:15:05.125
No. I'd rather you came with me.

1:15:22.416 --> 1:15:23.541
Put your cape on.

1:15:37.083 --> 1:15:38.083
Come on, Mom.

1:15:38.166 --> 1:15:39.875
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1:15:39.958 --> 1:15:41.083
It wants me.

1:15:48.583 --> 1:15:49.583
Mom!

1:15:50.458 --> 1:15:51.458
Mom!

1:15:54.916 --> 1:15:55.750
Mom!

1:16:00.333 --> 1:16:01.375
Mom!

1:16:14.500 --> 1:16:15.625
Mom!

1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:22.625
Mom!

1:16:32.666 --> 1:16:33.583
Mom!

1:16:47.958 --> 1:16:48.958
Mom.

1:18:00.375 --> 1:18:01.500
Get away from her!

1:18:04.125 --> 1:18:05.625
Get away from her!

1:18:07.916 --> 1:18:09.416
Get away from her!

1:18:25.208 --> 1:18:26.416
Get away!

1:18:41.041 --> 1:18:42.041
Mom.

1:18:46.166 --> 1:18:48.291
Mom, please. Please, Mom.

1:19:31.833 --> 1:19:33.125
Come on, Mom!

1:19:48.250 --> 1:19:49.291
Hold on.

1:20:01.750 --> 1:20:02.916
Come on, Mom.

1:21:38.583 --> 1:21:39.833
Carry on.

1:21:45.625 --> 1:21:47.166
Carry on.

1:23:38.208 --> 1:23:39.208
Here, Mom.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:46.000
Mom?

1:23:50.583 --> 1:23:51.583
Mom!

1:24:25.125 --> 1:24:26.208
Farewell, Mom.
