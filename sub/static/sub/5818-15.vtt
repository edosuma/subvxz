00:03.600 --> 00:05.125
I'm moving to Dallas
and I'm leaving today.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.243
- I've hired a nurse to come with me.
- What?

00:07.440 --> 00:09.090
- Do you have a better idea?
- Me.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.447
I will fix this. Stefan, I promise you.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.371
DAMON: I have a way to take down Rayna,
in a pile of bricks called the Armory.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.523

is a black hole of lies.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.766
No.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.764
You're not supposed to die for me, Bon.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.047
Neither's my brother.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.647
Which is why I have to
take myself out of the equation.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.122
You'll never have to worry about me again.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.042

FREYA: Klaus killed her,
but surprise, surprise.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.327
STEFAN: She regenerates.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.806

00:48.520 --> 00:50.807
this wound acts as a beacon,
drawing her to me.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.527
Well, I can't cure the wound,
but this paste will mask its signal.

Unless, of course... You missed?

02:41.480 --> 02:43.005
How many vampires have I killed
in the last few days?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.282
A lot. But who knows
how many you would have killed

02:45.480 --> 02:47.084
if you hadn't missed a third of the time.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.965

I can't see exactly where his heart is.

load him into the truck?

We got to get him out of here, before--

get suspicious?

03:05.320 --> 03:06.765
Too late.

named Stefan Salvatore?

03:43.520 --> 03:46.171
You mind just paying attention
to the road a little bit more?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.488
You know, I could, but then I might miss

03:48.680 --> 03:50.842
the world's largest ball of yarn
coming up on the left.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.326
And there it goes.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.805
Not quite sure what I was expecting.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.611
Well, that was the last of Freya's herbs.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.887
Which means it's only a matter of time

04:00.080 --> 04:01.650
before they wear off,
and Rayna can track me.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.609
- Good thing we're on our way to get more.
- Are we?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.330
Because it sure feels
like we're on our way

04:05.520 --> 04:07.010
to the world's largest waste of time.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.202
We have to take back roads
to avoid being spotted.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.765
You've only been running

Wait, you don't actually enjoy this,

Hmm. There's a certain constant
in the lack of constants.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.042
Once you accept it, it's invigorating.

We're here.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.129

Oh, well, according to Freya,

all the herbs witches use are stored here.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.291
STEFAN; And Why is that?

05:05.080 --> 05:07.924
Because witches are very fond
of their herbs.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.924
- Which is?
- A secret.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.009
Does it have to do
with killing Rayna, the Huntress?

05:32.320 --> 05:33.560
I'll never tell.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.968
But, yes.

This is the Damon only show.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.770
It's Damon, versus Rayna.

Because that won't get you
right back in hell.

- Well, look around, Bonnie.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.247
I'm not here
for the filmy hospital pudding.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.925
You almost died in that place.

And I'll never let that happen again.

No one needs to get hurt for me anymore.

I can handle Rayna.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.720
Here's where we stand.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.161
I've killed five of your friends

06:20.400 --> 06:22.687
because they couldn't tell me
where Stefan Salvatore was.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.326
I sure hope you can.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.363
You two, watch and learn.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.801
The key is to treat them
like you would a wild animal.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.765
Respecting the danger,
but recognizing that they're beneath you.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.689
And that they serve a purpose.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.882
For example,
this one will provide information.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.444
Tell me everything you know
about Stefan Salvatore

is rubbing off on you.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.646
It's quite pathetic, really.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.162
You know, you following him around
like some high school groupie.

12:07.360 --> 12:11.763
Hmm. I forgot you two used to be friends
and now you have none.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.729
- You think you're friends?

12:17.360 --> 12:18.407
(DOOR BEEPS)

12:20.320 --> 12:22.049
You must be Bonnie Bennett.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.887
I'm Alex St. John. Welcome to the Armory.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.882
I'm sorry for Enzo's behavior yesterday.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.570
He wasn't following proper protocol.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.171
I asked him to call you back here.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.328
We might have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.686
The wrong foot? Or?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.166
Not funny.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.721
I dunno. It's kind of funny.
(CHUCKLES)

12:40.760 --> 12:42.285
Rayna Cruz is a common enemy.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.084
We should be working together
to fight her.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.209
But you don't want to fight her,

12:46.400 --> 12:47.765
you want her captured.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.725
So I think you know a lot more
than you're letting on.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.849
Makes it hard for me to trust you.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.407
Fair.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.041
Why don't you come with me?

13:03.720 --> 13:07.725
This room contains everything
the Armory has gathered on Rayna Cruz.

13:08.080 --> 13:12.290
A list of victims. Her lineage.
The spell used to create her.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.686
And most importantly,
the Shamans that gave their lives for her.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.924
The Eight Everlastings.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.525
You mean Two Everlastings.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.882
The other six look pretty lasted.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.646
ALEX: There should be
three preserved corpses...

13:35.160 --> 13:36.571
We lost another one?

13:36.920 --> 13:38.570
Did you know about this?
Why wasn't I told?

13:38.760 --> 13:40.444
It must have just happened.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.680
Dammit.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.127
(SIGHS)

13:45.280 --> 13:47.806
I take it from her subtle shift
in attitude that's a bad thing?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.367
Every time Rayna dies,
one of the bodies decays.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.090
We've lost quite a few this past week.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.282
And if we lose all of them,
Rayna dies for good.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.961
So...

13:59.640 --> 14:02.246
Hunting vampires is your identity.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.643
Your fundamental, "This is who I am,"

14:06.680 --> 14:07.920
in a nutshell.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.523
You ever wonder
if there was a way to change that?

14:11.800 --> 14:14.087
No. I don't. Because there's not.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.327
I used to think that.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.527
Look, I'm selfish.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.202
Narcissistic.
Prone to unnecessary bouts of violence.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.209
Tell me again
why I shouldn't be killing you?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.050
Because I changed.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.607
I mean, temporarily, as it were,
but it happened.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.887
It just took the right person.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.087
Maybe you haven't found the right person.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.084
I don't need a vampire matchmaker.
But thanks.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.850
<i>DAMON: Well, I mean,
have you ever even tried?</i>

14:34.040 --> 14:37.169
Has there ever been a Mr. Hunter, huh?

14:39.880 --> 14:40.927
Oh...

14:41.280 --> 14:42.486
There has been.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.527
(CHUCKUNG)

14:45.520 --> 14:46.567
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

14:47.080 --> 14:48.127
I see.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.207
Hmm.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.806
Never mind.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.725
Looks like I don't have to pretend I care.
(GRUNTS)

14:59.280 --> 15:00.327
(COCKS GUN)

15:08.400 --> 15:10.687
You have five seconds
to tell me exactly what's happening,

15:10.880 --> 15:12.291
or you're not leaving here alive.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.681
I'm sorry.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.644
Did I hurt your feelings by lying

15:23.840 --> 15:25.683
about my true intentions for being here?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.882
- Feels crappy, doesn't it?
- What did you do?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.889
I didn't do anything.
Damon on the other hand--

15:30.040 --> 15:31.087
-ls an idiot.
- Why?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.248
Because he's finally taking care
of the problem you couldn't?

15:33.440 --> 15:36.205
No. Because every time Rayna dies,
she comes back stronger.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.686
Except for that last one, right?

15:37.880 --> 15:40.042
She won't be stronger
when she's dead for good.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.480
Why do you even want her alive?

15:41.680 --> 15:44.490
You know, I wouldn't worry about that.
I'd worry about this.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.121
This is the spell those Shamans used
to create her.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.608
- And?
- Just read it.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.602
SHAMAN: Great Spirit, we call upon you
in this moment of need.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.810
They live on within you.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.480
BONNIE: The sword. It has linking magic.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.323
It creates a bond
between Rayna and her victims.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.201
We knew that.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.600
That's not all.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.882
The Shamans didn't want her
going to her eternal rest

16:16.120 --> 16:17.246
with any unfinished business.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.805
So they added an extra addendum.

16:21.920 --> 16:25.129
The scars are a fail-safe.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.807
If Rayna dies,
so does anyone she's marked.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.131
Stefan has one of those scars,
doesn't he?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.087
(RINGING)

16:42.520 --> 16:44.443
I'm not happy
about you going against my wishes.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.211
DAMON: But, I do suppose
that me lecturing anyone

16:47.440 --> 16:48.566
on respecting authority--

16:48.800 --> 16:50.245
Where's Rayna?

16:50.480 --> 16:51.527
In a moderately shallow grave.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.603
You know, I got tired of digging.
But it should do the trick.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.211
- You have to dig her up.
- No way.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.081
She'll flame to life underground,
suffocate, poof! Final life over.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.520
Huntress problem solved.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.643
Rayna can't die again.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.604
- Pardon me.
- The wounds from her sword.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.211
It's linked her to her victims.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.721
If Rayna dies one last time,

17:10.880 --> 17:12.369
so does Stefan.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.329

17:29.000 --> 17:30.525
I haven't had visitors in years.

And then all of a sudden
two in a matter of days.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.565
VALERIE: I spoke with her while you slept.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.091
Somebody beat us to the punch.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.367
Came in and took all the herbs.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.447
Well, we need more.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.005
SCABBED WOMAN: Unfortunately,
there is no more.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.884
That herb is rare for a reason.

17:43.240 --> 17:46.164
It has strong anti-magic,
and therefore anti-witch properties.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.166
Let's just say
this isn't from a bad laser peel.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.249
- There has to be more somewhere.
- There's not.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.046
Witches eradicated it from the world
a century ago.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.804
This was the only source.

-(GU NSHOT)

18:03.000 --> 18:07.005
So, there are good vampires
and bad vampires.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.329
Yes. Kind of. It's complicated.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.688
And this is a bad vampire.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.202
- One that killed your sister?
- Yes.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.965
But that was a long time ago.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.850
And like I said, I'm not helping him.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.530
Again. It's complicated.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.802
Because you're helping his brother.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.207
- Who's a good vampire.
- Exactly.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.043
So this good vampire,

18:28.200 --> 18:30.043
does he feed on people, too?

18:32.200 --> 18:33.611
Does he kill them?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.330
Stefan...

18:36.520 --> 18:38.045
I mean, not right now, but--

18:38.280 --> 18:40.044
It's complicated?

18:42.040 --> 18:45.010
The thing is,
I've just spent the past few days with you

18:45.200 --> 18:47.168
learning about how much you hate vampires

18:47.360 --> 18:48.725
-and what they did to your town.
- I do.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.566
And yet, you just helped one of them
take down a vampire-killing machine.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.361
That doesn't sound complicated.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.042
Penny, you have no idea
what I've been through in this town.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.687
You're right. I don't.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.889
But I do wonder
how much of it you went through

19:04.160 --> 19:05.889
because you never took a real stand.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.729
At a certain point,

19:09.880 --> 19:13.407
it stops being the vampires' fault
that the town is like this.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.209
And it starts to be yours.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.241

- How are you?
- Oh, I've been better.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.927
Looks like it might actually be a while
before I can visit.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.482
Turns out those herbs
are a little more rare than we thought.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.721
Oh.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.645
Yeah. That's totally okay.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.083
Honestly, there's a chance there was
a little bit of contamination going on,

20:40.280 --> 20:42.851
so maybe it's not the worst thing.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.683
Hey listen, I was thinking, urn...

20:48.840 --> 20:51.081
I've been on the run with Valerie
for the last few days

20:51.280 --> 20:53.521
and without those herbs
I'm not gonna be able to slow down.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.842
But maybe you could tag in?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.367
I know being on the run seems awful.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.682
But it could be fun.
We could go to Europe.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.210
The Armory is on their way
to Mystic Falls.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.004
- They'll be there soon.
- Not soon enough.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.247
She's connected to an Everlasting.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.005
Maybe I can weaken it. And her.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.844
And maybe that will kill her,
and Stefan too.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.731
If I do nothing, she'll kill Damon.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.481
You're willing to kill for him?

24:35.160 --> 24:37.288
Do you really think he cares
that much about you?

24:37.480 --> 24:38.925
Yeah. I do.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.567
You have no idea
what he's planning, do you?

You wanna talk about Mr. Huntress now?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.651
Turns out I'm very interested
in this particular moment.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.564
- He was a vampire.
- Well, what do you know?

24:51.800 --> 24:54.121
Vampire-human affairs are my specialty.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.641
They were mine, too.
But they don't work out in the long run.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.285
Considering I staked him.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.847
Go ahead. Run.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.042
I don't mind chasing a second Salvatore.

25:02.240 --> 25:06.211
I couldn't maybe get like a
"I just saved your life" head start, huh?

25:06.440 --> 25:07.487

26:13.840 --> 26:15.968
I don't recall telling you to let her go.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.810
Well, I thought
we needed her help with Rayna.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.446
Yes. Rayna was the first priority.

I got your text.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.205
I didn't think you'd be able to kill her.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.244
Actually my exact message read,
"She's taken care of."

26:41.760 --> 26:43.649
- Yeah, she's taken care of.
- Yeah.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.886
What, so you didn't kill her?

26:46.120 --> 26:47.804
I did, a number of times.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.530
Turns out she only has eight lives.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.331
The last one's the problem.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.883
Turns out that if she dies for good,

26:55.080 --> 26:57.606
everyone with that scar
on your chest does as well.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.323
- So we can't kill her?
- No.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.010
But, the good news is,
the Armory has her,

27:05.200 --> 27:06.804
and they're not gonna let her escape.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.843
Right. Except for that time they did.

As long as I have this scar,
Rayna will hunt me.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.567
This isn't aboutjust you and me anymore.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.881
There's kids involved.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.206
I'm not gonna put them in danger.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.890
Which means that
I can't be with my girlfriend,

27:41.080 --> 27:42.411
as long as Rayna is alive.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.011
And you just told me she can never die.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.362
So, we have to figure out
another way to get rid of her.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.204
Or we need to get rid of this scar.

have been impossible for me.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.649
Nope. I'm gonna stay at one place.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.806

39:37.520 --> 39:38.646
Just enough time for me to get in,

39:38.800 --> 39:40.325
take out Little Miss Stabbypants
and grab Caroline.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.130
- Turn, turn, turn.
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

39:43.120 --> 39:44.167
We apologize for the interrupted program.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.004
- Well, that's not good.
-(GRUNTS)

39:46.320 --> 39:48.163
You've been poisoned with werewolf toxin.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.687
(GRUNTS)

39:49.960 --> 39:51.803
- MATT: Get up.
- You helping her?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.325
- MATT: All right, I did it. He's out.
{GROANS)

39:54.480 --> 39:56.164
STEFAN: Now I never see you again, right?

39:56.320 --> 39:57.481
Have a nice life.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.641
(GRUNTS)

40:01.800 --> 40:02.801
(EXHALES)

40:04.240 --> 40:05.321
(RAYNA SIGHS)

40:05.480 --> 40:09.246
I don't know about you...
(INHALES SHARPLY) But I'm exhausted.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.164
Feel like there should be champagne
or something.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.688
STEFAN: Yeah. You finally got me.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.161
Here I am.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.844
I'm totally not taking credit by the way.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.321
You came to me.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.889
You were safe. In the wind.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.730
You played it smart.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.242
Then you got dumb on me. What happened?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.367
I mean, okay, we know what happened.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.409
I took someone that you love.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.607
Damon.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.246
And Caroline.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.444
Guess that makes two people.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.128
Just out of curiosity,
which one of them brought you here?

40:48.520 --> 40:49.726
Her or him?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.603
Fine. Keep your secrets.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.200
You'll need something
to keep you company in hell.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.566
Or...

41:06.760 --> 41:08.444
There is a Plan B.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.965
But I know how you feel
about making choices.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.408
- Plan B?
- Yes.

41:15.760 --> 41:18.570
Because, believe it or not,
I don't actually want to kill you, Stefan.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.245
That doesn't make any sense.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.006
Just take my word for it.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.571
I know you don't deserve that mark.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.449
But somebody else does.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.240
What if I were to tell you
there was a way for me to transfer it

41:28.440 --> 41:30.442
to somebody a little bit more deserving?

41:32.480 --> 41:35.404
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
It should've been Damon all along.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.289
You know this as well as I do.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.288
You want to pit us against each other?

41:43.680 --> 41:44.966
Nice try.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.250
Except it wasn't her idea.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.285
It was mine.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.641
