WEBVTT

00:05.233 --> 00:08.862
Appreciate you doing this for me, Max.
You almost ready?

00:08.953 --> 00:14.505
Cos Fat Tony and his crew
always show up at the 49 Club by nine.

00:14.593 --> 00:18.472
Get there late and you risk them
already hooking up with their goumadas.

00:19.953 --> 00:24.469
- Their what?
- Goumada. Like a comare. A girlfriend.

00:25.113 --> 00:29.789
Thanks. Just tell me about the guy
I'm supposed to get close to.

00:29.873 --> 00:32.341
Dougie Colantonio.
Goes by the name of Books.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.391
What is it with these wise guys
and their stupid nicknames?

00:35.473 --> 00:38.271
He's an accountant for
the Sparacino crime syndicate.

00:38.353 --> 00:41.151
A while back,
he was all set to rat on the family

00:41.233 --> 00:45.385
in exchange for Eyes Only's guarantee
of witness protection and a new identity.

00:45.473 --> 00:50.593
I mean, it was the scoop of a lifetime, Max.
He was gonna give me the capo di tutti capi.

00:51.873 --> 00:55.343
- The capo tutti whattie?
- The boss of bosses.

00:56.513 --> 01:00.950
No one outside the organisation's
even seen this guy. He's totally paranoid.

01:01.033 --> 01:06.232
No one knows what he looks like. Every time
he goes out in public he wears a disguise.

01:06.313 --> 01:08.668
Dougie was gonna get him to the track

01:08.753 --> 01:11.472
so Matt Sung could swoop in
and slap the cuffs on him.

01:11.553 --> 01:14.750
- What happened?
- He lost his nerve.

01:14.833 --> 01:20.749
Now he won't even talk to my source. He says
that he's a stand-up guy and he's no stoolie.

01:21.273 --> 01:24.151
I ain't buying it.
Little mook just needs convincing.

01:24.233 --> 01:28.306
Someone spent too much time
listening to surveillance tapes.

01:28.393 --> 01:32.147
- What?
- I said I got it. My mission is to flip Dougie.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.824
What do you think?

01:42.513 --> 01:44.026
Fuhgeddaboudit.

01:48.193 --> 01:51.663
So you guys are in waste management.
Is that like garbage men?

01:51.753 --> 01:54.586
No, sweetie. We're more on the corporate end.

01:54.673 --> 01:59.827
Local businessmen pay us a fee and we send
our crews out to take the trash off the streets.

02:00.793 --> 02:03.671
There's, like,
so much trash on the streets.

02:03.753 --> 02:06.904
- Business is booming.
- To the Pulse.

02:06.993 --> 02:10.383
- To the Pulse.
- You guys are kidding, right?

02:10.473 --> 02:14.830
Best thing that ever happened to a collective
of honest businessmen like ourselves.

02:14.913 --> 02:19.941
Crime rate is up. Police corruption is back.
Even the pezzonovantes have their hands out.

02:20.033 --> 02:23.708
End of the century,
the Mob was a dying breed, then bada bing!

02:23.793 --> 02:28.344
One little nuclear air burst fried
all the Sputniks, and we are back, baby.

02:28.433 --> 02:31.231
Number one with a bullet.

02:31.313 --> 02:35.670
And what do you do with
the corporation, good fella?

02:35.753 --> 02:40.269
- I'm the accountant.
- Yeah. He cooks the books.

02:40.353 --> 02:42.992
He keeps the books. Right, Doug?

02:45.553 --> 02:49.102
- Don't take it personal. He's got a condition.
- Epilepsy.

02:49.993 --> 02:53.303
Epilepsy. It's not epilepsy. It's necrophilia.

02:53.393 --> 02:56.908
Shut up, both of you. It's narcolepsy.

02:56.993 --> 03:01.703
Makes a person fall asleep for
no good reason, like some kind of babbo.

03:04.953 --> 03:09.231
Heads up here. We got ladies present.

03:09.313 --> 03:13.147
- Nice of you to call me a lady, Tony.
- Wasn't talkin' about you, Mia.

03:13.233 --> 03:16.703
Now, scram. You know the boss
don't want you around Books here.

03:16.793 --> 03:18.988
Shouldn't that be up to Dougie?

03:21.873 --> 03:24.671
You heard him. Scram.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.868
- Who's the skirt?
- You want we should bar you from the club?

03:29.753 --> 03:32.108
Now beat it!

03:34.233 --> 03:37.384
- What's her dealio?
- Don't worry about it.

03:40.913 --> 03:43.825
- You just have a nice time.
- OK.

03:49.113 --> 03:52.025
You think that's funny?
You think you're a comedian?

03:52.113 --> 03:54.502
I didn't mean to.
I don't know how it happened.

03:54.593 --> 03:57.187
Clumsy guys like you
need to be more careful.

03:57.273 --> 04:02.506
- You could have an accident.
- It's OK. I'll go to the ladies room and dry off.

04:14.473 --> 04:16.464
Get outta here.

04:31.873 --> 04:35.468
- Sorry about before.
- It's OK.

04:35.553 --> 04:37.783
- I'm Mia.
- Dorothy.

04:37.873 --> 04:41.832
That's a pretty name.
So, Dorothy, what do you do?

04:42.673 --> 04:46.552
- I'm a bike messenger at Jam Pony.
- That sounds like fun.

04:46.633 --> 04:51.423
- So you're Dougie's new girl?
- Not exactly.

04:53.273 --> 04:55.707
Well, what exactly?

05:07.793 --> 05:11.672
Actually, my name's Max.

05:11.753 --> 05:16.873
- I'm undercover on a mission for Eyes Only.
- What kind of mission?

05:16.953 --> 05:21.583
To get Dougie to flip on the Sparacino family,
finger the boss for Eyes Only.

05:21.673 --> 05:25.666
- It's the scoop of a lifetime.
- That is so exciting!

05:25.753 --> 05:29.302
But, Max, you have to be careful.
Those guys are dangerous.

05:29.393 --> 05:33.022
It's cool. I'm genetically engineered.
I can kick their asses.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.308
- You're kidding.
- No. I'm from Manticore.

05:35.393 --> 05:39.272
- I cover my barcode with make-up.
- Me, too.

05:39.353 --> 05:41.947
I'm Psy-Ops. What about you?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.228
- X-series.
- Neat!

05:44.313 --> 05:46.193
Well, Max, since you and I
are sharing all girlfriend-like,

05:46.193 --> 05:48.149
Well, Max, since you and I
are sharing all girlfriend-like,

05:48.233 --> 05:53.626
why don't you tell me who Eyes Only really is
cos I'd like to talk to him about something.

05:56.833 --> 06:00.621
- I can't.
- I won't tell. I promise.

06:02.113 --> 06:06.152
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK. You don't have to.

06:06.793 --> 06:10.672
But, for tonight, forget about Dougie, OK?

06:10.753 --> 06:13.904
You just go on home and get some rest.

06:13.993 --> 06:17.349
Actually, I am kind of tired.

06:19.633 --> 06:23.467
- I've said too much.
- Don't worry. You won't remember.

06:23.553 --> 06:26.943
- Remember what?
- Remember to powder your nose.

06:36.513 --> 06:41.223
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.304
Then she escaped.

06:43.393 --> 06:47.705
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

06:47.793 --> 06:50.148
she is haunted by her past.

06:50.233 --> 06:55.102
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.987
I thought you'd swing by last night,
which is why I was paging you.

07:38.593 --> 07:42.745
I got really tired all of a sudden.
Went home and slept for, like, four hours.

07:44.513 --> 07:49.064
- You slept for four hours?
- I must be coming down with something.

07:49.753 --> 07:51.903
What'd you want, anyway?

07:52.993 --> 07:55.826
To find out what happened with Dougie.

07:55.913 --> 07:58.029
- Dougie?
- Yeah.

07:58.113 --> 08:02.186
- Yeah. Didn't work out.
- What do you mean, "didn't work out"?

08:02.273 --> 08:06.266
A waiter spilled a drink on me,
kind of killed the evening, so I bounced.

08:06.353 --> 08:10.585
OK, Max. If you didn't wanna do this for me,
all you had to do was say so.

08:10.673 --> 08:14.461
- It just didn't work out.
- Sounds like you weren't trying very hard.

08:14.553 --> 08:18.068
Sounds like I did you a favour
and now I'm getting a scolding for it.

08:18.153 --> 08:23.352
This is important. If your heart's not in it,
feel free to opt out. I'll find someone else.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.708
I told you I'd do it so I'll do it.

08:25.793 --> 08:28.353
Hook me up
and I'll take another shot at Dougie.

08:28.433 --> 08:32.745
If I wanted to get reprimanded,
I could always go to work.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.107
I don't know why you won't return to the ring.

08:36.193 --> 08:40.106
You were like a master, my friend.
You were unequalled. Without peer.

08:40.193 --> 08:43.663
I did enjoy knocking
grown men unconscious for a living,

08:43.753 --> 08:47.587
but there comes a time in life
when you say "that was then and this is now"

08:47.673 --> 08:50.790
and move on to bigger
and oh-so-better things.

08:50.873 --> 08:53.626
- Hi there.
- Hi. I'm looking for a job.

08:53.713 --> 08:55.624
Well, sorry, we're staffed.

08:55.713 --> 08:58.944
Normal. Why so quick to say no?

08:59.033 --> 09:03.106
Why don't you at least let
the lovely young lady fill out an application?

09:03.193 --> 09:05.024
What?

09:08.113 --> 09:10.946
There's an application form in the back.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.546
Thanks, pal.

09:13.713 --> 09:16.546
- Hi there. I'm Alec, by the way.
- Mia.

09:16.633 --> 09:20.103
It is a pleasure to know you. I know you.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.902
- I don't think so.
- No, I do. I'm sure of it.

09:25.473 --> 09:27.782
Back at Manticore.

09:27.873 --> 09:33.664
I spent six months in Psy-Ops for evaluation.
You were there. I never forget a face.

09:33.753 --> 09:36.551
- Can't put anything past you.
- Not now, not ever.

09:36.633 --> 09:40.706
Now what was your specialty again?
Was it hypnosis? Telekinesis?

09:40.793 --> 09:43.148
- Telecoercion, actually.
- Right.

09:45.553 --> 09:47.908
Hi. I'm Mia.

09:49.193 --> 09:51.582
Alec. Nice to meet you.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.507
- Who's the honey?
- Some girl looking for a job.

09:59.593 --> 10:02.585
- Please tell me Normal's gonna hire her.
- Yeah.

10:05.553 --> 10:09.705
Here you go. I warn you, though, I got a stack
of résumés in there as high as my tush.

10:11.473 --> 10:13.862
Can I be a dispatcher?

10:15.353 --> 10:17.469
Yeah. Nothing less will do.

10:17.873 --> 10:19.989
Neat!

10:22.233 --> 10:24.224
Do I know you?

10:24.313 --> 10:28.511
I don't think so, since I just started
working here today. I'm a dispatcher.

10:28.593 --> 10:30.982
It's really fun.

10:31.073 --> 10:33.064
Yeah, I guess.

10:34.753 --> 10:36.744
Here you go.

10:37.673 --> 10:39.664
Thanks.

10:41.633 --> 10:46.104
- Bad day, boo?
- Yeah. I had a weird scene with Logan earlier.

10:46.193 --> 10:49.185
I thought you two were trying
to get things back to normal.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.822
I figured what's more normal
than volunteering for his urgent,

10:52.913 --> 10:55.473
let's-save-the-world Eyes Only missions?

10:55.553 --> 10:59.592
- The man loves his work.
- Only I forgot how focused he can get.

10:59.673 --> 11:03.985
I mean, he asked for my help, but then
it's like nothing I do is good enough.

11:04.073 --> 11:06.951
- Sometimes I just don't get him.
- Well, get this.

11:07.033 --> 11:10.343
Here comes your boy.
I bet he's bringing an apology with him.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.788
Hey, guys. Mind if I join you?

11:12.873 --> 11:16.149
Have a seat.
I was just gonna zip to the ladies room.

11:21.073 --> 11:23.792
- Wanted to talk to you about earlier.
- OK.

11:23.873 --> 11:26.626
You said you wanted
to stick with the mission.

11:26.713 --> 11:29.273
I got a tip Dougie will be
at the club tomorrow night.

11:29.353 --> 11:34.711
I thought if you were serious about taking
another run at him, that'd be the time.

11:34.793 --> 11:37.261
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

11:37.353 --> 11:41.744
- Is that all you're gonna say?
- Is that all I'm gonna say?

11:42.353 --> 11:46.631
- What? What did I do?
- Nothing. Never mind.

11:49.353 --> 11:52.345
- I'm gonna go get a drink.
- Bar's over there.

11:59.593 --> 12:04.747
- Are you sure we've never met before today?
- Positive. I'd remember you.

12:04.833 --> 12:07.393
You just seem so familiar.

12:07.473 --> 12:11.102
- Who was that guy talking to Max?
- Logan? That's her boyfriend.

12:11.193 --> 12:16.108
They like to pretend that nothing's going on
between 'em. It's psychotic.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.304
- But sweet.
- You don't like him?

12:23.673 --> 12:28.428
Logan? He's all about saving the world
and doing good for others.

12:28.513 --> 12:31.073
It's really boring.

12:31.153 --> 12:32.984
But admirable.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.022
- Hey, Alec.
- Logan.

12:37.113 --> 12:39.946
Hi. I'm Mia.

12:40.033 --> 12:42.149
I'm Logan. It's nice to meet you.

12:42.233 --> 12:46.226
Logan, I think there's something
that Alec wants to say to you.

12:48.513 --> 12:49.353
Yeah, Logan, I just wanted to say that
I understand why Max admires you so much.

12:49.353 --> 12:53.392
Yeah, Logan, I just wanted to say that
I understand why Max admires you so much.

12:54.073 --> 12:57.668
Sometimes I wish I had
more of a purpose in life.

12:57.753 --> 13:01.428
Logan, is there something
you want to say to Alec?

13:01.513 --> 13:07.065
Well, it's just that sometimes
I wish I was more of a free spirit.

13:07.153 --> 13:11.783
It must be nice to be a happy-go-lucky
sociopath. I kind of envy you.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.151
Group hug!

13:18.153 --> 13:20.621
What the hell is goin' on over there?

13:20.713 --> 13:24.991
If I hadn't seen it with my own two eyes,
I wouldn't have ever believed it.

13:25.073 --> 13:27.064
Hey, guys.

13:32.993 --> 13:35.382
OK. Later.

13:36.393 --> 13:38.384
Yeah, later.

13:42.073 --> 13:46.703
- So you're Max's boyfriend, right?
- Something like that.

13:47.713 --> 13:52.184
- Actually, I'm crazy about her.
- Then why aren't you together?

13:52.273 --> 13:55.504
- It's a long story.
- I love long stories.

13:55.593 --> 13:58.153
Plus I've got oodles of time.

14:01.473 --> 14:05.830
I shouldn't be telling you this, but a secret
government agency called Manticore

14:05.913 --> 14:09.303
infected her with a deadly virus
genetically targeted to my DNA.

14:09.393 --> 14:12.829
- Bummer. Why'd they do that?
- They wanted to kill me.

14:12.913 --> 14:14.904
How come?

14:15.993 --> 14:18.382
Because I'm Eyes Only.

14:19.113 --> 14:21.911
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:29.353 --> 14:31.025
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:31.113 --> 14:33.946
- Gosh! It's so exciting.
- What is?

14:34.033 --> 14:37.946
That you're getting back into the ring,
coming out of retirement.

14:38.033 --> 14:39.785
I am?

14:39.873 --> 14:43.991
Just in time for the big
elimination fight tomorrow night.

14:44.073 --> 14:47.270
Do my ears deceive me?
Monty Cora rides again?

14:47.353 --> 14:49.821
I'm back, baby!

14:50.473 --> 14:53.465
Lovely!

14:53.553 --> 14:56.989
You know how long I've been
waiting to hear this? Magnificence.

14:57.073 --> 15:01.066
Shirtless muscle rippling,
sweat flying of him like 1,000 points of light.

15:01.153 --> 15:05.590
- He's one of my bigger fans.
- You're my hero. I live to serve you.

15:05.673 --> 15:09.871
I had this dream about you the other night.
You were this Roman gladiator.

15:09.953 --> 15:10.513
You slew barbarians and Medusa-like women,
and I was your tiny little valet.

15:10.513 --> 15:14.825
You slew barbarians and Medusa-like women,
and I was your tiny little valet.

15:14.913 --> 15:18.269
I wiped your sword clean
after every sweet victory.

15:18.353 --> 15:21.550
I rubbed your tired,
beautiful, golden muscles...

15:21.633 --> 15:24.022
Hot run! Fourth and Main.

15:29.273 --> 15:31.582
Sweetie, what's wrong?

15:31.673 --> 15:34.870
- Is it Logan?
- Yeah.

15:34.953 --> 15:38.992
Listen, everything's going to work out, OK?

15:39.073 --> 15:42.588
- You really think so?
- We'll talk. Come to Crash later.

15:42.673 --> 15:45.551
I can't. I promised Logan
I'd do this thing for him.

15:45.633 --> 15:49.672
At the 49 Club? With Dougie?
You don't have to worry about that.

15:50.433 --> 15:54.108
- Wait. How'd you know?
- Never mind. Forget I said anything.

15:54.193 --> 15:57.230
- Meet you at Crash later?
- OK.

16:02.953 --> 16:05.626
- There's something about that girl.
- Who?

16:05.713 --> 16:09.991
- The new dispatch girl, Mia.
- Yeah, there's something about her all right.

16:10.073 --> 16:13.986
I feel like I've met her before,
but I can't place where.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.985
Do not attempt to adjust your set.

16:17.073 --> 16:21.112
- Sid, turn it up.
- The cable hack will last exactly 60 seconds.

16:21.193 --> 16:26.187
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped,
and it is the only free voice left in this city.

16:26.273 --> 16:30.312
For too long, the Sparacino family
has held Seattle in a stranglehold.

16:30.393 --> 16:35.626
From behind a veil of secrecy, its boss
and his men tyrannise and rob our citizens.

16:35.713 --> 16:38.705
- But Eyes Only knows who you are.
- Since when?

16:38.793 --> 16:43.913
- Isn't it the case you're helping Logan with?
- I'm supposed to do it tonight, I think.

16:43.993 --> 16:49.306
Your disguises will no longer protect you.
Your identity is about to be exposed.

16:49.393 --> 16:52.590
And once that happens,
you will have nowhere to run.

16:52.673 --> 16:57.303
I thought we had a stranglehold
on waste collection. Listen to this trash.

16:57.393 --> 17:01.864
Your empire's in ruins.
Even your own lieutenants can't be trusted.

17:01.953 --> 17:05.388
They're ripping you off,
making a fool out of you.

17:05.473 --> 17:07.667
Check the records.

17:07.752 --> 17:09.789
Something doesn't add up.

17:09.873 --> 17:12.340
You think you can operate unchecked,

17:12.433 --> 17:16.506
that your money and your
underworld influence will keep you safe?

17:16.593 --> 17:18.788
But just look around.

17:18.873 --> 17:20.989
The boss wants to see us.

17:22.272 --> 17:24.150
Now.

17:24.233 --> 17:27.191
Now that misplaced trust
will mean the end of you

17:27.272 --> 17:30.629
and the destruction of your illegal operations.

17:30.713 --> 17:33.227
Be warned.

17:33.913 --> 17:38.987
This has been a Streaming Freedom Video
bulletin. Peace. Out.

17:39.073 --> 17:41.746
How was that?

17:41.833 --> 17:43.744
Perfect.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.631
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.545
I think I was supposed to do
something with Max tonight.

17:50.633 --> 17:54.342
Must be nice to have a transgenic
to help you with your missions.

17:54.433 --> 17:57.231
It's great. Wait a second,
how'd you know that?

17:57.313 --> 18:01.226
Never mind. Forget I said anything.
Forget I was even here.

18:01.953 --> 18:04.308
- See you at Crash later?
- OK.

18:11.313 --> 18:15.101
It may seem like I'm content
being this good-for-nothing slacker,

18:15.193 --> 18:19.550
but the truth is that I don't plan on being
a bike messenger the rest of my life.

18:19.633 --> 18:22.750
- It's good to have goals.
- Yeah.

18:24.673 --> 18:28.063
I haven't told anybody this,
but last week I dropped them off a résumé.

18:28.153 --> 18:29.950
That's swell, Sketch.

18:30.033 --> 18:34.151
If New World Weekly hires me,
I'll get to the bottom of this mutant thing.

18:34.233 --> 18:38.272
It says here some of them
even have paranormal psychic abilities.

18:38.353 --> 18:39.502
Like what?

18:39.593 --> 18:42.744
They mess with your mind
and you don't know it's happening.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.791
Seems a little far-fetched to me.

18:45.873 --> 18:48.182
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

18:48.273 --> 18:51.231
Gosh, imagine what would be involved.

18:51.313 --> 18:55.545
Manipulating brain waves, interfering
with short-term memory formation.

18:55.633 --> 18:58.193
Just seems a little hard to believe.

18:58.273 --> 19:01.902
I guess it sounds kind of ridiculous
when you put it like that.

19:01.993 --> 19:05.633
Yeah. Still, sounds like a really good job.
I hope you get it.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.305
Yeah. Still, sounds like a really good job.
I hope you get it.

19:10.993 --> 19:13.382
Just what the doctor ordered.

19:14.353 --> 19:18.141
You probably shouldn't drink
the night before a big fight.

19:20.273 --> 19:22.503
You know what? You're right.

19:22.593 --> 19:25.153
You are gonna do great. I just know it.

19:25.233 --> 19:28.509
That's how come I'm gonna stake you
five grand. How's that sound?

19:28.593 --> 19:30.072
That sounds great.

19:30.153 --> 19:32.269
You should probably go home and rest up.

19:32.353 --> 19:36.471
Yeah, I'll just go home
and rest up for tomorrow night.

19:49.073 --> 19:52.065
Maybe I should go check out
the action over there.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.663
Caught your hack.

19:56.753 --> 20:00.302
Well, I didn't come to talk shop.
I just wanted to see you.

20:00.393 --> 20:02.384
Well...

20:04.433 --> 20:07.106
- How'd you flip Dougie?
- I didn't.

20:07.193 --> 20:10.469
Then how'd you know
who the capo tutti-frutti guy was?

20:10.553 --> 20:14.228
- I don't.
- Then why'd you say you did?

20:14.313 --> 20:16.747
- I have my reasons.
- Like what?

20:16.833 --> 20:22.783
- You tipped the guy you're looking to out.
- I thought you weren't interested in this case.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.864
- I'm not.
- Then why the questions?

20:24.953 --> 20:26.989
I'm just wondering...

20:27.073 --> 20:31.305
Kids, come on.
You guys love each other, remember?

20:31.393 --> 20:34.783
Don't fight. You're here to have a good time.

20:35.873 --> 20:37.864
See you tomorrow.

20:40.833 --> 20:45.145
I like that Mia. She's nice.
Although there is something about her.

20:45.233 --> 20:47.463
Yeah, that's what I keep thinking,

20:47.553 --> 20:52.388
ever since I met her, except I can't
exactly remember when I met her.

20:57.713 --> 21:00.068
Should I go powder my nose again?

21:00.553 --> 21:02.748
Remember to powder your nose.

21:02.833 --> 21:06.143
- Wait a minute. I did meet her.
- You did?

21:06.233 --> 21:10.021
At the 49 Club, with Dougie.

21:10.113 --> 21:12.343
At least I think it was with Dougie.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.867
- You think?
- Yeah.

21:14.953 --> 21:16.989
- I don't know.
- Max.

21:17.073 --> 21:22.067
If it was her, it's not exactly a coincidence
her looking for at a job at Jam Pony.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.701
Wakey, wakey.

21:59.793 --> 22:02.546
- I'm a dead man. I'm history.
- What's wrong?

22:02.633 --> 22:06.023
Didn't you see what that Eyes Only
got on the TV and said?

22:06.113 --> 22:09.662
- I must have missed it.
- The boss is gonna know I talked to him.

22:09.753 --> 22:12.586
- God, what was I thinking?
- Here.

22:12.673 --> 22:15.187
I'm about to be killed
and you give me a paper bag?

22:15.273 --> 22:18.106
You're gonna hyperventilate. Breathe.

22:19.233 --> 22:22.145
Poor Dougie.
I told you the life wasn't for you.

22:22.233 --> 22:25.350
Don't start with that again.

22:25.433 --> 22:28.470
I gotta do something.
Something to prove my loyalty.

22:28.553 --> 22:33.024
I need a plan, a course of action. Something!

22:33.113 --> 22:36.185
It's that Catholic thing.
I'm having bad thoughts.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.345
- I'm having bad thoughts!
- Everything's gonna be OK.

22:39.433 --> 22:42.789
No, Mia. Not unless that
Eyes Only shuts his trap.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.864
Don't worry about Eyes Only.
I'm gonna take care of him.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.866
I'm gonna make everything
all right for you, OK?

22:54.313 --> 22:56.781
Now, did you bring the money?

22:58.913 --> 23:02.622
- 5,000. I gotta be crazy.
- No, you're not.

23:02.713 --> 23:06.422
I've got a sure thing that'll make
a lot of money for you, me and the boss.

23:06.513 --> 23:09.505
You have to just trust me, OK?

23:09.593 --> 23:13.347
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
I'm crazy about you.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.393
I still can't believe a girl like you
could love a guy like me.

23:16.393 --> 23:18.304
I still can't believe a girl like you
could love a guy like me.

23:18.393 --> 23:24.343
Believe it. Just make sure you bring
your boss to the fight hall tomorrow. OK?

23:47.753 --> 23:49.232
Hey, you!

23:52.913 --> 23:55.302
- Hey, you!
- Hey yourself.

23:57.113 --> 23:59.627
OK. I deserved that.

24:01.433 --> 24:04.311
- You're Manticore.
- Yeah.

24:06.353 --> 24:09.425
- You don't look like an X-series.
- I'm Psy-Ops.

24:09.513 --> 24:13.711
Cosying up to big shots, getting them
to tell me what they know. It's fun.

24:13.793 --> 24:17.342
Good for you. What's your connection
to Dougie Colantonio?

24:17.433 --> 24:20.266
I don't think that's any of your business.

24:21.993 --> 24:25.872
Tell me what you were doing with him
or I wrap you around this post.

24:25.953 --> 24:29.582
Dougie's in trouble with his boss
on account of the Eyes Only broadcast.

24:29.673 --> 24:32.551
I gotta help prove his loyalty
or he'll wind up dead.

24:32.633 --> 24:36.546
- Prove his loyalty how?
- With a hot tip on a fighter that can't be beat.

24:36.633 --> 24:41.024
He gives that tip to his boss, everybody
makes a mint at the fight tomorrow night.

24:41.113 --> 24:45.709
Dougie proves his worth and he and I
run away, live happily ever after, the end.

24:45.793 --> 24:49.991
Give me a break. You expect me
to believe you're in love with Dougie?

24:50.073 --> 24:53.668
- What's wrong with Dougie?
- Never mind.

24:53.753 --> 24:57.143
He's not going anywhere
until he fingers the boss for Eyes Only.

24:57.233 --> 24:58.951
- Says who?
- Says me.

24:59.033 --> 25:03.185
That's funny, cos you're not gonna
even remember this conversation.

25:06.953 --> 25:08.466
- Morning, Max.
- Hey, Mia.

25:09.473 --> 25:10.713
- What happened to your eye?
- Craziest thing.

25:10.713 --> 25:11.828
- What happened to your eye?
- Craziest thing.

25:11.913 --> 25:14.825
Woke up this morning and it was there.
No idea how.

25:14.913 --> 25:18.826
I think you slipped in the shower and
banged yourself on the shampoo caddy.

25:18.913 --> 25:21.507
- Must've hurt like the dickens.
- That's weird.

25:21.593 --> 25:24.346
- What?
- That's exactly what happened.

25:24.433 --> 25:29.348
Slipped in the shower, banged my head on
the shampoo caddy. Hurt like the dickens.

25:29.433 --> 25:34.029
- You should try to be more careful, Max.
- Yeah, thanks. I will.

25:41.633 --> 25:44.306
Here you go. That's for you.

25:44.393 --> 25:47.191
- Where did you get this kind of cash?
- Don't ask.

25:47.273 --> 25:51.425
- Eight o'clock tonight, Monty. Don't be late.
- Yeah.

25:56.153 --> 25:58.906
The kid gets in the ring at eight o'clock.

25:58.993 --> 26:03.464
You let it ride the rest of the night,
you'll make a couple mill easy.

26:09.713 --> 26:12.910
- You say it's a sure thing?
- A sure thing, boss.

26:12.993 --> 26:18.431
Good. Because I need
a sure thing right about now.

26:19.513 --> 26:25.827
What's this about this Eyes guy going on TV,
saying that my men disrespect me?

26:25.913 --> 26:28.871
- It's like a knife in the heart.
- He's lying, boss.

26:28.953 --> 26:31.547
We'd never disrespect you and you know that.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.705
What I know is I got a reputation to uphold.

26:34.793 --> 26:40.231
Can't let the other families be talking
behind my back, thinking I lost my edge.

26:40.313 --> 26:43.862
- Are you sure this is a sure thing?
- I'm sure, boss.

26:43.953 --> 26:47.832
You better be,
because if your boy doesn't come through,

26:47.913 --> 26:51.462
you two are gonna end up
at opposite end zones.

26:52.553 --> 26:55.351
- Capeesh?
- Let's go.

27:06.113 --> 27:08.832
- Logan.
- You all right?

27:09.593 --> 27:11.982
Yeah. What are you doing here?

27:15.393 --> 27:18.783
I was worried about you
after I didn't hear back from you last night.

27:18.873 --> 27:21.387
I've been paging you ever since.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.182
Batteries in my pager must be dead.
Didn't hear a peep.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.427
I must've lost it.

27:31.073 --> 27:33.985
- So how'd it go last night?
- How'd what go?

27:34.953 --> 27:38.912
You followed Mia to see if there was
any connection between her and Dougie.

27:38.993 --> 27:40.426
I did?

27:40.513 --> 27:43.471
You don't remember?
What happened to your eye?

27:43.553 --> 27:47.068
Slipped in the shower,
banged my head on the shampoo caddy.

27:47.153 --> 27:49.144
You're kidding.

27:52.913 --> 27:55.222
Or maybe I was in a fight.

27:57.153 --> 28:00.509
- Maybe you were in a fight?
- With Mia.

28:02.873 --> 28:07.549
- She hit me. Really hard. That bitch!
- What are you talking about?

28:07.633 --> 28:09.703
- She's Manticore.
- Mia?

28:09.793 --> 28:12.546
Yeah. In Psy-Ops.

28:12.633 --> 28:18.583
Paranormal Research Division.
She does this thing to make me forget.

28:18.673 --> 28:21.790
Manticore made transgenics
that screw with people's heads?

28:21.873 --> 28:25.309
Yeah, she met with Dougie.
She's up to something.

28:25.393 --> 28:28.942
- What else happened?
- I sat up embroidering them all night.

28:29.033 --> 28:31.263
They may be a little itchy.

28:32.833 --> 28:35.267
Thanks, Normal. They're great.

28:35.353 --> 28:37.742
- Good luck, buddy.
- All right.

28:40.873 --> 28:43.671
What was that about? You fighting again?

28:43.753 --> 28:45.072
Tonight.

28:45.153 --> 28:50.625
Are you insane? The last time, White
caught you and threw your ass in a cage.

28:50.713 --> 28:52.305
True.

28:52.393 --> 28:55.942
So how could you be stupid enough
to get back into the ring?

28:56.033 --> 28:59.150
Funny, I've been asking myself
the same question.

29:03.153 --> 29:03.824
Mia.

29:19.593 --> 29:22.630
Look who's here. Tony and his crew.

29:24.633 --> 29:27.545
Mia and Dougie have gotta be
around here somewhere.

29:37.593 --> 29:42.428
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen,
for Ricky "The Ripper" Ramberg!

29:45.113 --> 29:49.982
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure
to introduce our next challenger.

29:50.073 --> 29:56.023
New to our arena, coming in
at six feet and weighing 178 pounds:

29:56.113 --> 30:00.345
The marvellous Monty Cora!

30:10.393 --> 30:14.022
- What is he thinking?
- Your shorts look great.

30:18.073 --> 30:20.462
- There they are.
- Let's do it.

30:26.233 --> 30:28.622
On the bell, gentlemen.

30:52.073 --> 30:57.431
Let it all ride on Monty Cora there, Sparky.
Thank you.

30:59.193 --> 31:02.742
- He's fantastic, Mia.
- Told ya!

31:05.553 --> 31:08.784
- You better get back over there.
- Thank you.

31:12.073 --> 31:15.110
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kick your ass.

31:15.193 --> 31:16.865
Hi.

31:16.953 --> 31:20.150
Hey, there's Logan. Hi, Logan.

31:22.393 --> 31:26.864
- So, what are you guys up to?
- I was about to ask you the same question.

31:28.393 --> 31:30.987
Here we go again.

31:41.673 --> 31:47.543
The titan of terror,
give it up for Jim the Jackal.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.704
Thank you, my man.

32:13.153 --> 32:15.986
Tommy Thunderfists!

32:24.793 --> 32:25.873
That's what I like.

32:25.873 --> 32:26.783
That's what I like.

32:34.113 --> 32:37.105
- Can I get a drink?
- You OK?

32:37.193 --> 32:41.630
Yeah. Except I think
Mia put the whammy on me again.

32:41.713 --> 32:45.183
- I have no idea what we just talked about.
- I do.

32:46.353 --> 32:49.584
Yeah. Forgot you were listening.
Thank God.

32:49.673 --> 32:52.585
Dougie's worried the boss
will hear he talked to Eyes Only.

32:52.673 --> 32:55.745
Mia convinced Alec to fight
so Dougie can help the Don.

32:55.833 --> 32:57.630
- The boss is here?
- Somewhere.

32:57.713 --> 33:00.705
Dressed as a peanut vendor, probably.

33:00.793 --> 33:03.148
Dougie's about to make him a small fortune.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.986
Once he gets back in his good graces,
he'll never flip.

33:06.073 --> 33:09.588
Unless Alec goes down and the boss
loses his money on account of Dougie.

33:09.673 --> 33:13.791
- What are the chances of that happening?
- Depends on Alec.

33:13.873 --> 33:15.511
I'll call Matt Sung.

33:15.593 --> 33:17.982
Tell him to get his butt over here.

33:21.153 --> 33:24.589
Four... three... two... one.

33:29.593 --> 33:32.346
- Alec.
- Max, hey. You wanna bet on me?

33:32.433 --> 33:34.230
- Lose this next fight.
- What?

33:34.313 --> 33:37.783
- Take a dive, hit the mat, lose the fight.
- I'm up 100 grand.

33:37.873 --> 33:42.389
- You don't get it. Mia played you.
- No, she spotted me my start-up money.

33:42.473 --> 33:46.352
She fixed the fight so a bunch of mobsters
could make a killing on you.

33:46.433 --> 33:49.982
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
- Logan's been after them for months.

33:50.073 --> 33:53.463
If you don't throw the fight,
they get off scot-free.

33:54.953 --> 33:56.944
It's not my problem.

34:03.553 --> 34:08.581
Gentlemen, you know the drill. When I leave
the ring, the fight begins. Any questions?

34:08.953 --> 34:10.944
Thank you very much.

34:13.672 --> 34:15.947
Let's go, let's go.

34:24.033 --> 34:26.149
You're up $122,000.

34:26.233 --> 34:29.031
Undefeated against 12 opponents

34:29.112 --> 34:33.186
and still standing after all comers,
we have a new champion...

34:33.273 --> 34:35.264
Not so fast.

34:40.233 --> 34:42.224
I'll take him on.

34:47.873 --> 34:51.946
- We have a new challenger.
- What the hell are you doing?

34:52.033 --> 34:55.389
I told you to take a dive.
Now I'm gonna have to beat your ass myself.

34:55.473 --> 34:57.509
- What's wrong with making money?
- Name?

34:57.593 --> 35:00.312
She has no name.
She's not here. She's not fighting.

35:00.393 --> 35:01.826
Yes, I am.

35:01.913 --> 35:07.226
Ladies and gentlemen, in this corner,
hailing from parts unknown,

35:07.313 --> 35:12.751
let's hear it for the Curvaceous Killer!

35:13.673 --> 35:16.107
- What do you think?
- What do you mean?

35:16.193 --> 35:20.709
Look at the freakin' odds.
Put it all on Dougie's guy for the boss.

35:20.793 --> 35:23.387
- How much?
- How much?

35:23.473 --> 35:25.941
All of it. "How much?"

35:27.353 --> 35:29.548
You are so dead, missy-miss.

35:33.913 --> 35:36.302
Excuse me, I'm gonna squish to the front.

35:36.393 --> 35:40.830
- Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Everything on Monty Cora.

35:40.913 --> 35:43.273
- Here are the rules. There ain't no rules.
- You don't wanna fight me.

35:43.273 --> 35:45.229
- Here are the rules. There ain't no rules.
- You don't wanna fight me.

35:45.313 --> 35:50.307
- I've been waiting for this chance for months.
- Well, see, you're just a girl.

35:50.713 --> 35:54.672
Hey! She jumped the bell!
What are you doing? She jumped the bell!

35:55.153 --> 35:57.542
Ring the bell. Would you ring the bell?

35:59.433 --> 36:01.663
Should have known you'd cheat.

36:01.753 --> 36:04.347
- That's for the virus.
- That was not my fault.

36:04.433 --> 36:08.870
- That's for trying to kill Joshua.
- I was just trying to protect my own.

36:08.953 --> 36:13.424
- For getting paint over my research papers.
- OK, that was my bad.

36:13.513 --> 36:16.869
- She's good. She's really good.
- Yeah.

36:17.393 --> 36:20.829
- For making Joshua deliver your packages.
- Cut it out!

36:22.033 --> 36:24.228
That's for losing my baseball.

36:26.353 --> 36:30.949
This is for whatever
stupid thing you do next.

36:31.033 --> 36:33.945
- Kick her ass!
- OK, that's it.

36:40.433 --> 36:42.469
Lovely!

36:42.553 --> 36:46.546
You better be at work tomorrow there, miss.
Pumpkin?

36:47.633 --> 36:50.022
Kill the messenger!

36:50.113 --> 36:53.150
- My turn now, bitch.
- What did you just call me?

36:53.233 --> 36:55.872
You heard me. B-l-T-C...

36:55.953 --> 36:59.502
Look at that. The ring girl just lost her top.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.470
Yeah.

37:24.513 --> 37:26.026
Sorry.

37:29.473 --> 37:32.704
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for our new champion:

37:32.793 --> 37:37.230
The Curvaceous Killer!

37:44.553 --> 37:50.583
If you were thinking of going over there and
working your mojo on Dougie, think again.

37:51.993 --> 37:55.781
Come on. Let's take a little ride.

38:00.713 --> 38:04.501
Douglas Colantonio?
Detective Matt Sung, Seattle PD.

38:04.593 --> 38:07.869
- He's got nothing to say to you.
- You're about to get dead.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.706
You were on thin ice
before you lost the boss's money.

38:10.793 --> 38:14.752
You go with them, you're gonna end
your night in cement shoes.

38:14.833 --> 38:18.746
Cement shoes. Who talks like that?

38:18.833 --> 38:22.303
These clowns don't know
what they're talking about. Come on.

38:22.393 --> 38:25.624
We can take you into protective custody.
Just say the word.

38:25.713 --> 38:28.625
You won't get as good an offer from the boss.

38:28.713 --> 38:31.022
Tell us who he is, you get a fresh start.

38:31.113 --> 38:33.752
Come on, Books. Let's go. Come on.

38:35.713 --> 38:38.102
All you have to do is point a finger.

38:41.273 --> 38:43.912
That's him, right there!

38:43.993 --> 38:46.063
Stop her!

38:46.153 --> 38:48.269
You're dead. You're dead!

38:58.873 --> 39:01.262
I never really liked him much, anyway.

39:03.153 --> 39:06.509
You're under arrest for murder,
racketeering and bookmaking.

39:06.593 --> 39:08.504
You have the right to remain silent.

39:08.593 --> 39:13.030
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

39:16.393 --> 39:20.147
Now, wait a second. I don't get it.
You wanted Dougie to flip?

39:20.233 --> 39:23.782
I've been trying to get him
out of this life since the day we met.

39:23.873 --> 39:28.503
That's why I had you do the Eyes Only hack.
To push Dougie into doing the right thing.

39:28.593 --> 39:31.266
So this whole thing was a setup?

39:31.353 --> 39:34.106
I knew you'd show up here
once you got onto me,

39:34.193 --> 39:38.948
plus I knew you'd do whatever it took
to help keep Dougie from running off.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.792
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.

39:44.793 --> 39:46.465
- What's that?
- My winnings.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.544
- You bet on me?
- Course.

39:48.633 --> 39:52.945
- How'd you know I'd win?
- Cos girls kick ass.

39:53.033 --> 39:55.672
- That's what the T-shirt says, right?
- Wait.

39:55.753 --> 39:58.187
If you wanted to get Dougie to quit the life,

39:58.273 --> 40:01.583
why didn't you do your thing
to make him do what you wanted?

40:01.673 --> 40:06.110
You know, I think that's why I love him
so much. He's totally immune to me.

40:06.193 --> 40:10.948
I think it's cos his brain wiring's
a bit screwy on account of his condition.

40:11.033 --> 40:14.309
So you like not having him
wrapped around your finger?

40:14.393 --> 40:18.022
Yeah. What fun is being in love
if everything's easy?

40:20.593 --> 40:23.790
Look what you did to him.
What the hell are you?

40:25.433 --> 40:30.348
Normal, honey, you need to forget
everything you saw here tonight.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.461
I do?

40:33.553 --> 40:37.068
Just take Alec back to his place,
then you go on home to bed.

40:37.153 --> 40:41.305
Maybe you'll have one of those nice
gladiator dreams you like so much.

40:41.393 --> 40:43.748
Yeah. I like that.

40:44.433 --> 40:47.106
You. Here you go.

40:47.833 --> 40:50.142
Thank you so much.

40:50.953 --> 40:52.944
Let's go there, buddy.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.425
All right, Dougie, time to go.

40:58.513 --> 41:02.950
- Wait, where are we going?
- Maui. Come on. We got a plane to catch.

41:09.153 --> 41:11.713
You are a beautiful, talented man.

41:15.033 --> 41:19.549
And you? You couldn't be a more
rocking, awesome chick if you tried.

41:20.513 --> 41:25.712
You two are gonna have the best life together.
You're so perfect for each other.

41:25.793 --> 41:30.025
I know life stinks a little right now.
It can't always stink, right?

41:30.113 --> 41:34.584
Believe me, if Dougie and I
can make it work, so can you.

41:34.673 --> 41:37.949
- Always remember that, OK?
- I have a feeling I will.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.905
All right. Nappy, time to go.

41:45.233 --> 41:49.784
Can't really be mad at her.
I mean, you got your guy.

41:49.873 --> 41:51.864
And she got hers.

41:54.353 --> 41:56.583
- Shall we?
- May as well.

41:58.553 --> 42:01.226
So I hear you're a rocking, awesome chick.

42:01.313 --> 42:03.986
And you're a beautiful, talented man.

42:04.073 --> 42:06.064
That's right.

42:22.713 --> 42:26.023
